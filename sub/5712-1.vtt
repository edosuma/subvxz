01:01.762 --> 01:03.998
Negative. No sign.

01:36.609 --> 01:39.745
Wait a second. I think I got him.

02:05.939 --> 02:07.741
You know...

02:07.841 --> 02:11.061
you could put somebody's
eye out with that thing.

02:11.711 --> 02:14.948
We airlifted out the last passengers,
Ace. We're heading out.

02:15.648 --> 02:18.985
What about the animal cargo?

02:19.385 --> 02:23.323
Don't worry about it. It's just one little
raccoon. If I were you, I'd turn back.

02:23.624 --> 02:29.663
Yeah? Well, if you were me, then I'd be you,
and I'd use your body to get to the top.

02:29.763 --> 02:32.932
You can't stop me,
no matter who you are.

02:34.867 --> 02:36.918
Loser.

02:42.792 --> 02:46.678
Loo-s-e-r.

03:03.496 --> 03:05.014
Hungry, fella?

03:20.279 --> 03:22.881
That ought to hold you for a while.

03:57.683 --> 04:02.387
That's okay, Spike.
There's nothing more we can do.

04:04.991 --> 04:06.791
Look, Spike.

04:33.085 --> 04:38.266
Do not fret, my little woodland friend, for
your life is in the hands of Ace Ventura...

04:38.367 --> 04:40.357
Pet Detective.

04:52.972 --> 04:55.073
Whatever you do...

04:58.077 --> 04:59.645
don't look down.

05:33.278 --> 05:35.515
Hang on! Hang on, little buddy!

05:36.215 --> 05:38.785
I got you. I think I got you.

05:39.785 --> 05:42.121
Maybe not. You're slipping.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.756
Don't let go!

05:53.333 --> 05:57.740
No!

06:53.860 --> 06:55.927
My goodness.

07:05.671 --> 07:08.174
Well, hello. Yes.

07:08.274 --> 07:10.743
Well, now, that was quite a shock.

07:10.843 --> 07:13.747
It's... It's extremely
nice to meet you.

07:13.847 --> 07:20.253
Now, my name is Fulton Greenwall,
and I am looking for an Ace Ventura.

07:20.353 --> 07:24.040
No man here carries with him...

07:24.141 --> 07:26.460
- a label.
- What?

07:27.060 --> 07:30.263
Oh, yes. No names. How silly of me.

07:30.363 --> 07:33.266
Well, he's an American.

07:33.366 --> 07:38.705
We are all children of
the same life force.

07:39.005 --> 07:42.808
Yes, of course we are.
Well... he bends over,

07:42.909 --> 07:46.314
- and he speaks from his rear.
- Oh, him.

07:47.314 --> 07:50.182
Right this way.

07:50.482 --> 07:53.185
He came to us a broken man.

07:53.285 --> 07:56.689
He had lost the will to
sustain his existence.

07:56.789 --> 07:59.893
Yes. I heard about that unfortunate
accident with the raccoon.

07:59.993 --> 08:02.195
It was terrible for him,

08:02.295 --> 08:06.999
but the life force once
again smiled upon him.

08:07.099 --> 08:09.868
He's now at peace.

08:25.017 --> 08:26.851
I will wait here.

08:50.509 --> 08:54.747
- I must apologize.
- Quite. Well, no harm done.

08:54.847 --> 08:57.850
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Fulton Greenwall.

08:57.950 --> 09:01.387
I was sent here to employ your services
in the retrieval of a lost animal.

09:01.487 --> 09:03.389
Now, can you help us?

09:04.289 --> 09:07.092
Your request is not unlike
your lower intestine...

09:07.192 --> 09:11.431
- stinky and loaded with danger.
- We can pay you handsomely.

09:11.731 --> 09:17.002
I am now a child of light.
Your earthly money holds no appeal to me.

09:17.102 --> 09:19.339
Twenty thousand dollars.

09:19.439 --> 09:25.911
Re-eh-eh-eh-eh-eeaaly!

09:28.581 --> 09:29.681
No.

09:31.283 --> 09:35.655
I cannot, for I am sorely needed...

09:35.755 --> 09:37.288
here...

09:39.058 --> 09:40.426
at the Ashram.

09:40.526 --> 09:44.329
If I may interject!
We are short of space,

09:44.429 --> 09:47.900
and it's important for
you to use your talents.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.438
Let me help you pack.

09:52.338 --> 09:55.875
But I am yet to attain omnipresent
supergalactic oneness.

09:55.975 --> 09:58.711
No. Wait.

09:58.811 --> 10:03.349
There it is. You've just attained it.

10:03.449 --> 10:06.586
- I have?
- Yes. Just now.

10:06.686 --> 10:08.554
You are one.

10:09.354 --> 10:12.692
I can see it in your eyes.

10:12.992 --> 10:15.261
You're more one than anyone.

10:15.361 --> 10:17.864
What about my medallion
of spiritual accomplishment?

10:17.964 --> 10:18.998
Take mine.

10:20.798 --> 10:23.236
This took you 80 years to achieve.

10:23.336 --> 10:26.704
That's ok. I don't like
it anymore. Really.

10:29.575 --> 10:33.278
In the light of this personal
sacrifice you've made...

10:35.114 --> 10:37.682
I have no choice...

10:38.850 --> 10:40.486
but to take the case.

10:40.586 --> 10:43.589
Great! I'll go tell the others!

10:43.689 --> 10:45.556
Master...

10:48.727 --> 10:50.763
break it to them gently.

11:16.639 --> 11:21.444
I've never seen them act like that before.
Denial can be an ugly thing.

11:21.544 --> 11:25.248
Well, we should go, Mr. Ventura.
I've arranged a plane.

11:25.348 --> 11:27.350
I'll meet you at the bottom.

11:27.550 --> 11:31.686
There's still one more thing
I must do before I go.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.832
Isn't this incredible?

11:43.332 --> 11:45.934
It's going to be some
kind of a record.

11:46.334 --> 11:48.471
Everyone loves a slinky

11:48.571 --> 11:51.874
You got to get a slinky
Slinky, slinky

11:51.974 --> 11:53.775
Go, slinky, go!

11:56.979 --> 11:59.581
Oh, man!

11:59.681 --> 12:03.286
Can you believe it?

12:03.386 --> 12:06.055
It was right there!

12:06.455 --> 12:07.857
Can I do it one more time?

12:07.957 --> 12:11.527
Please forgive me, sir, but if we don't
hurry now, we might miss the plane.

12:12.127 --> 12:15.664
Of course. How selfish of me.

12:15.764 --> 12:20.468
Let's do all the things
that you want to do.

12:44.309 --> 12:46.612
Canadian moose during mating season.

12:46.912 --> 12:48.746
And now...

12:49.848 --> 12:51.482
a yak.

13:00.491 --> 13:01.527
Peanut?

13:02.427 --> 13:06.965
Yes. I have one right here.
It's bulky, but I consider it carry-on.

13:07.065 --> 13:08.433
Peanut.

13:09.601 --> 13:11.371
Oh, I see.

13:12.971 --> 13:15.541
If we can get back
to business, Mr. Ventura?

13:15.641 --> 13:18.711
The Wachati are a peaceful tribe.

13:18.811 --> 13:21.980
Since their sacred
animal has vanished,

13:22.080 --> 13:27.119
they believe that there is a
curse fallen on their village.

13:27.419 --> 13:30.256
It all started some time ago...

13:31.056 --> 13:34.359
So the daughter of the Wachati chief

13:34.459 --> 13:37.996
is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe,

13:38.396 --> 13:42.001
and the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage.

13:42.101 --> 13:46.505
But if it is not recovered,
the result will be

13:46.605 --> 13:50.441
the merciless slaughter
of the Wachatis.

13:52.110 --> 13:53.678
Uh, Mr. Ventura?

13:55.748 --> 13:57.449
Mr. Ventura!

13:58.549 --> 14:01.454
There's... someone on the wing...

14:01.554 --> 14:04.188
some... thing.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.363
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

14:10.463 --> 14:13.465
The daughter of the Wachati chief

14:13.565 --> 14:18.337
is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe.

14:39.274 --> 14:41.243
Spectacular.

14:42.043 --> 14:44.879
This land holds great beauty.

15:00.695 --> 15:02.030
How far to the crime scene?

15:02.130 --> 15:04.800
Well, I've been instructed to
bring you first to the consulate,

15:04.900 --> 15:08.204
which should be beyond those trees
on the other side of the jungle,

15:08.304 --> 15:10.839
so we'll have to circle around...

15:13.074 --> 15:14.141
Oh, no!

15:17.279 --> 15:18.813
Steering's a little loose.

15:20.482 --> 15:23.050
Alignment's off, too.

15:24.319 --> 15:25.587
Mr. Ventura!

15:33.729 --> 15:36.933
<i>Oh, you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we love you</i>

15:37.033 --> 15:40.135
<i>And our pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us, too</i>

15:40.235 --> 15:41.336
<i>Hi ho</i>

15:41.436 --> 15:43.772
<i>Everywhere we go,
on Chitty Chitty we depend</i>

15:43.872 --> 15:47.108
<i>Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
our fine, four-fendered friend</i>

15:47.208 --> 15:50.579
<i>Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
our fine, four-fendered</i>

15:50.679 --> 15:53.514
<i>Chitty Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Bang Bang, yeah!</i>

15:56.218 --> 16:01.624
<i>Chitty</i>

16:06.161 --> 16:09.331
- Oh, there's the consulate.
- Oh, thank God.

16:09.431 --> 16:12.000
If I can just find a parking spot.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.003
Perhaps we should slow down
just a teensy-weensy bit.

16:15.203 --> 16:16.871
Nonsense, poopy pants.

16:17.839 --> 16:21.743
We're going a bit fast!
Really! Look out!

16:35.757 --> 16:38.426
Like a glove.

16:44.666 --> 16:47.069
You might want to think about
getting this baby detailed.

16:47.169 --> 16:51.707
Oh, no. The consulate general's car.

16:52.107 --> 16:54.376
Down, Boba. That's it. Down.

16:54.976 --> 16:57.178
Yes. Good.

17:10.608 --> 17:12.175
Come on, man.

17:20.151 --> 17:21.819
Whoa.

17:25.290 --> 17:28.660
Mr. Ventura, so looking
forward to your arrival.

17:34.632 --> 17:37.436
Funny, it didn't seem that painful
when you were doing it to the horse.

17:38.445 --> 17:42.507
Sir, Mr. Ventura has an
affinity for animals.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.578
Shall we?

17:46.378 --> 17:47.445
Shalln't we?

17:50.883 --> 17:54.852
Tell me, Mr. Ventura,
just how good are you?

17:56.421 --> 17:57.856
You're an extreme workaholic.

17:57.956 --> 18:00.825
You recently returned from a short
trip to Gotan in Northern Africa,

18:00.925 --> 18:03.861
and upon your return, you more than likely
took a nasty spill because of some...

18:05.531 --> 18:07.833
shoddy masonry work.

18:08.033 --> 18:11.804
Very impressive. Might one ask how?

18:12.104 --> 18:13.305
Surely.

18:16.006 --> 18:17.343
The abrasion on the
palm of your left hand

18:17.443 --> 18:19.712
is the type one sustains
breaking a fall of 3 to 5 feet.

18:19.812 --> 18:21.380
The small remnants of plaster
on the tip of your shoe

18:21.480 --> 18:23.281
pointed to a careless
Mason being the culprit.

18:23.381 --> 18:26.284
Your new watch, a quality forgery of
a Cartier, was most likely purchased

18:26.384 --> 18:29.421
through the north African black market,
known to reside in Gotan.

18:31.357 --> 18:35.260
- And my work habits?
- Yes. A workaholic.

18:35.360 --> 18:39.097
The urine stain on your pants would
signify that you're a single-shake man,

18:39.397 --> 18:41.800
far too busy for
the follow-up jiggle.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.302
Brilliant, Mr. Ventura.
Simply brilliant.

18:44.402 --> 18:47.571
Spank you, Greenwall.
Spank you very much.

18:51.243 --> 18:54.646
Mr. Ventura, we've been coexisting
quite nicely with the native cultures

18:54.746 --> 18:58.682
for the past 200 years.
They're almost like family at this point.

18:58.782 --> 18:59.684
Are they?

18:59.784 --> 19:02.787
It is imperative that we
recover the sacred animal.

19:02.887 --> 19:06.725
If not, the peaceable Wachatis
will assuredly be obliterated.

19:06.825 --> 19:09.094
The Wachootoos are bloodthirsty.

19:09.194 --> 19:13.398
They consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse.

19:20.271 --> 19:22.240
Do I have something in my teeth?

19:23.642 --> 19:27.312
Cadby! Lovely brunch, I must say.

19:28.312 --> 19:32.684
Quinn. I'd like you
to meet Ace Ventura.

19:32.784 --> 19:37.022
This is Burton Quinn. He owns and
operates Quinnland Safari Park.

19:37.122 --> 19:38.422
Most call me Quinn.

19:40.024 --> 19:41.625
Say hello, Tinky.

19:41.925 --> 19:46.409
Pleasure, Tinky. <i>Corvus corax</i>.
Common raven. The smartest of all birds.

19:46.510 --> 19:48.530
Rare in these parts.

19:53.572 --> 19:55.406
Excuse me.

20:01.012 --> 20:03.114
That's quite a wrap you're wearing.

20:03.214 --> 20:05.717
Perhaps I could get you
some fluffy new slippers

20:05.817 --> 20:09.220
made from the heads of innocent
and defenseless baby seals.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.457
Who is this ghastly man?

20:12.557 --> 20:15.066
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. And...

20:15.167 --> 20:18.697
you must be the monopoly guy.

20:19.197 --> 20:20.699
Hey.

20:21.199 --> 20:23.969
Thanks for the free parking.

20:24.369 --> 20:27.038
Another activist, Maguire.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.868
Activist. Yes.

20:30.776 --> 20:32.780
"Activist. Yes."

20:35.680 --> 20:37.281
Mr. Ventura,

20:37.381 --> 20:42.020
there's nothing wrong with
enjoying the fruits of nature.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.055
You should try it sometime.

20:44.355 --> 20:46.189
Alrighty, then.

20:50.395 --> 20:53.131
You know something? You're right.

21:25.630 --> 21:28.767
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

21:32.571 --> 21:35.407
It's lovely, but I fancy
myself an autumn.

21:39.845 --> 21:42.313
If you've quite finished,
Mr. Ventura,

21:42.413 --> 21:45.949
we might make for the
projection room, Greenwall.

21:46.384 --> 21:47.919
Kooky.

21:49.521 --> 21:54.126
Mr. Ventura, I'd like you to meet Hitu,
chief of tribal security in the province.

21:54.226 --> 21:56.028
Please!

21:56.428 --> 21:59.463
Don't... get up.

22:06.037 --> 22:08.501
At this point,
we don't have any leads,

22:08.602 --> 22:11.042
but we've had similar
problems in the past.

22:18.283 --> 22:19.852
Sorry.

22:23.854 --> 22:25.323
This is Derrick McCane.

22:25.423 --> 22:28.226
Spotted several times in the
province in the past year,

22:28.326 --> 22:33.931
Mr. McCane makes a handsome living
from rare and endangered species. Hitu.

22:36.034 --> 22:40.705
Now, these two are Australians.
The bald one is Mick Katie.

22:40.805 --> 22:44.508
The other is said to have
been raised by aborigine...

22:47.378 --> 22:50.815
Aborigines. The natives call him...

22:53.452 --> 22:55.887
Call him Gahjii The Hunter.

22:58.022 --> 23:02.060
Both are known poachers and
have been seen in the area!

23:02.360 --> 23:05.698
Mr. Ventura! This wedding ceremony
is going to take place in four days.

23:05.798 --> 23:09.801
I cannot have bloodshed in my province!
We are counting on you!

23:20.178 --> 23:23.215
Hi ho, silver! Away!

23:23.615 --> 23:26.785
I've assigned Greenwall
to assist you.

23:27.185 --> 23:30.287
Before you go, Mr. Ventura,

23:30.387 --> 23:34.026
there's something I'd like to show you,
something you might enjoy.

23:34.126 --> 23:37.528
As one animal lover to another.

23:55.647 --> 23:57.649
Something wrong, Mr. Ventura?

24:02.454 --> 24:06.124
Of course not. This is
a lovely room of death.

24:06.224 --> 24:08.893
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

24:12.930 --> 24:14.433
Down, Boba.

24:22.940 --> 24:24.741
Mr. Ventura, how could you?

24:44.562 --> 24:48.567
Now, Mr. Ventura, I think the village
is roughly about a mile ahead.

24:48.667 --> 24:51.203
Excellent. Flat tire.

24:53.705 --> 24:56.709
I think this joke has run
its course, don't you?

24:57.209 --> 25:01.613
Certainly. I prostrate myself before
you and beg your forgiveness.

25:01.713 --> 25:04.116
Don't get me wrong. I mean,
I do enjoy the occasional prank.

25:04.216 --> 25:06.550
It's just that my heel
is getting rather raw.

25:10.154 --> 25:13.057
We love you, dark continent!
Good night!

25:16.327 --> 25:17.429
Listen.

25:20.432 --> 25:23.568
The majestic song of the
male silverback gorilla.

25:23.868 --> 25:26.371
I think we should move along.
It's their mating season,

25:26.471 --> 25:28.740
and they can get rather hostile.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.644
<i>Wee dee dee dee dee dee
dee dee dee dee</i>

25:32.744 --> 25:36.314
<i>Dee, owimoweh</i>

25:36.414 --> 25:39.817
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh,
Owimoweh, owimoweh</i>

25:39.917 --> 25:42.086
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh...</i>

25:42.386 --> 25:46.924
Oh. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Ventura.
I have to rest.

25:47.024 --> 25:49.426
- Of course you do!
- Oh.

25:49.526 --> 25:53.030
The Wachatis believe they draw
their power from these caves,

25:53.130 --> 25:57.636
but they now live in fear since
the vanishing of their sacred bat.

25:58.536 --> 25:59.970
Bat?

26:02.741 --> 26:04.876
What? Bat?

26:05.176 --> 26:07.646
The one we're here
to find, Mr. Ventura.

26:07.746 --> 26:11.249
You didn't say anything about a bat.

26:11.349 --> 26:13.985
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

26:14.085 --> 26:16.754
Have you ever seen a bat?
They're hideous.

26:16.854 --> 26:21.726
Lifeless beady eyes, clawed feet,
huge, grotesque wings, even fangs.

26:25.630 --> 26:27.866
They give you rabies, you know.

26:28.966 --> 26:34.173
Yes. Quite. I see your point. But are you
saying that you won't take the case?

26:35.273 --> 26:38.276
No. As a being of light,
I must show compassion

26:38.376 --> 26:41.180
- for all the living things of nature.
- Good.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.582
I'm not touching it, though.

26:43.682 --> 26:46.418
No, spank you.

26:59.464 --> 27:04.703
The Wachati are a peaceful people.
They find all forms of life sacred.

27:04.803 --> 27:06.804
I like them already.

27:06.904 --> 27:10.241
<i>Bumbawae atuna.
Bumbawae atuna.</i>

27:10.341 --> 27:14.379
Hi there. Nice to see you.
Bumblebee tuna. Bumblebee tuna.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.282
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

27:17.382 --> 27:21.385
How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty, then.

27:24.188 --> 27:27.559
Excuse me. Your balls are showing.

27:27.659 --> 27:29.728
Bumblebee tuna.

27:30.228 --> 27:33.799
They have lived in the same
state for thousands of years.

27:33.899 --> 27:37.702
They did not know about disease
until the white man came.

27:42.522 --> 27:43.875
What's going on over here?

27:43.975 --> 27:46.478
Oh, yes. Now, all young
Wachati warriors

27:46.578 --> 27:50.014
must face five days of
balance and concentration.

27:50.114 --> 27:54.952
Should he lose his focus and fall,
he must start all over again.

27:56.054 --> 27:57.687
Earthquake test.

28:01.826 --> 28:06.230
He's good. With my help,
he could be the best.

28:06.330 --> 28:10.535
Maybe we should see the chief,
Mr. Ventura. This way.

28:10.635 --> 28:12.436
Neat-o!

28:26.651 --> 28:29.388
The chief says he
knew you would come.

28:29.888 --> 28:32.389
Libby libby wa!

28:34.258 --> 28:37.738
Chim chiminy chim chim cher-oo! Hey!

28:41.299 --> 28:44.702
The chief says he has not
understood the dialect you're using.

28:44.802 --> 28:48.407
Tell him I'm happy to meet
him and that his sacred...

28:49.407 --> 28:52.210
bat is as good as found.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.824
Oh, my goodness. The chief
really seems to like you. I mean,

29:05.924 --> 29:09.561
that is a great sign of
affection in the Wachati tribe.

29:09.661 --> 29:15.266
Re-eh-eh-eh-eh-eeaaly!

29:15.366 --> 29:17.869
Oh, this is the chief's son, Ouda.

29:17.969 --> 29:21.006
The missionaries came through
and taught him a spot of English.

29:21.106 --> 29:22.907
I like you.

29:27.845 --> 29:29.446
My...

29:30.548 --> 29:32.482
Aren't I the popular one?

29:36.054 --> 29:39.357
Allow me to display my affection.

30:08.419 --> 30:11.790
It is the mucus that binds us.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.292
<i>A bubo obe.</i>

30:14.392 --> 30:18.162
The chief says that the
sacred hut is over there.

30:25.603 --> 30:27.105
How did they get past the guard?

30:27.205 --> 30:31.709
Well, I'm afraid he was found
shortly after... sleeping.

30:33.111 --> 30:37.214
At ease, soldier.
We all make mistakes.

30:48.526 --> 30:53.031
Quite an auspicious dwelling
for a filthy flying weasel.

30:53.631 --> 30:54.866
<i>Alla Shikaka!</i>

30:55.466 --> 30:57.435
Please, Mr. Ventura.
That is sacred ground.

30:57.535 --> 31:00.538
I'm sorry, but only the Wachati
are allowed to step there.

31:00.638 --> 31:03.541
Hey... Take it easy.

31:03.641 --> 31:05.744
I'm the loogie guy, remember?

31:17.755 --> 31:20.291
Y-yes, yes, chief. Thank you.

31:20.391 --> 31:22.927
<i>Dalu.</i> Thank you.

31:23.427 --> 31:27.733
The chief says unless the sacred bat is
returned before the marriage of the princess,

31:27.833 --> 31:31.636
the entire Wachati tribe
will meet their death.

31:31.736 --> 31:33.972
What type of bat are
we talking about here?

31:34.072 --> 31:36.540
The great white bat, of course.

31:45.616 --> 31:49.820
<i>- Corpus kilochiroptera?</i>
- Yes, but to the natives...

31:50.220 --> 31:51.322
<i>Shikaka.</i>

31:56.126 --> 31:57.260
<i>Shikaka?</i>

32:01.599 --> 32:02.768
<i>Shikaka!</i>

32:05.869 --> 32:08.740
Shikasha!

32:09.340 --> 32:11.542
Shh... Shish kebab.

32:11.642 --> 32:14.479
Shh... Shawshank redemption. Chicago!

32:14.979 --> 32:16.948
You're... out of there!

32:17.048 --> 32:19.417
Go on. You're gone. Go on!

32:43.457 --> 32:44.925
Were you going to eat these?

32:50.898 --> 32:52.366
Ace.

32:57.371 --> 33:00.206
I've got to inspect that cage.

33:06.912 --> 33:08.582
My, my, my.

33:09.082 --> 33:11.485
This fruit paste is delicious.

33:12.085 --> 33:14.956
- And the pottery is lovely.
- It's made from guano.

33:15.056 --> 33:18.325
Guano? That sounds so familiar.

33:18.425 --> 33:19.926
Bat droppings.

33:23.964 --> 33:25.766
Guano is the chief
resource of the Wachati.

33:25.866 --> 33:28.234
They use it to make many
things in the village.

33:29.536 --> 33:31.638
Yummy.

33:53.559 --> 33:59.167
Oh. Now, this is really fascinating.
This is a great Wachati tradition...

33:59.267 --> 34:02.302
the virgin's dance of seduction.

34:06.974 --> 34:11.478
I am now a holy man. I think of women
only as the mothers of our children.

34:11.879 --> 34:14.681
They are a sanctuary for
the reproductive organs,

34:14.782 --> 34:18.418
a temple to house the
miracle of procreation.

34:19.119 --> 34:20.386
Do you have a dollar?

34:25.559 --> 34:29.963
Oh! Thank you so much.
I've not danced in years.

34:49.333 --> 34:50.900
Hi.

34:52.136 --> 34:55.339
Don't mind me. Sleep.

34:56.340 --> 34:57.908
Sleep.

34:59.143 --> 35:00.844
Sleep.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.419
Fee... fi...

35:08.519 --> 35:11.055
fo... fum!

35:11.455 --> 35:15.959
I smell... the fingerprints of scum!

35:20.665 --> 35:23.266
Better dust the place.

35:38.182 --> 35:40.284
Totally clean.

35:40.384 --> 35:43.519
Not one damn clue.

35:45.689 --> 35:47.790
Unless...

36:28.332 --> 36:32.536
Here she comes. Oh, boy.
Holy, holy, holy, holy.

36:32.636 --> 36:35.706
Good thoughts in, bad thoughts out.
Good, bad, good, bad, good, good...

36:35.806 --> 36:38.143
You have come to help us.

36:38.343 --> 36:41.545
We are in great appreciation.

36:42.245 --> 36:43.880
You...

36:44.648 --> 36:45.883
speak English.

36:46.083 --> 36:47.312
Yes.

36:47.751 --> 36:49.887
The missionaries...
they come with books.

36:57.494 --> 36:59.678
You are very good with that.

37:00.297 --> 37:02.199
It's incredibly accurate.

37:02.899 --> 37:04.700
Care to try?

37:10.207 --> 37:11.908
Not bad.

37:12.009 --> 37:14.712
Try again. Relax your shoulders...

37:14.812 --> 37:17.949
breathe... and release.

37:20.484 --> 37:22.284
There you go.

37:23.187 --> 37:25.288
You make me smile.

37:26.723 --> 37:28.691
And yet...

37:29.226 --> 37:31.327
I am troubled.

37:32.529 --> 37:34.231
You see...

37:34.331 --> 37:37.434
the man my father
wants me to marry...

37:37.934 --> 37:40.803
I am worried I will not please him.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.608
I...

37:46.810 --> 37:49.645
I have never known a man.

37:58.955 --> 38:02.226
I would love to help, but you see,

38:02.326 --> 38:06.730
I have vowed to take
a life of celibacy.

38:07.530 --> 38:10.329
Well, perhaps this...

38:10.430 --> 38:12.768
will assist your decision.

38:17.874 --> 38:22.513
Those are very nice, but I'm
a child of light... a pure spirit.

38:22.613 --> 38:25.683
I am no longer encumbered
by the appetites of the flesh.

38:29.586 --> 38:32.156
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

38:32.256 --> 38:35.259
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

38:35.359 --> 38:39.095
Oh, mama. Ooh, mama. Ooh, mama.

38:40.197 --> 38:41.534
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ventura...

38:42.834 --> 38:44.368
I...

38:48.105 --> 38:50.007
That's ok.

38:50.307 --> 38:52.408
I was just...

38:53.610 --> 38:56.079
practicing my mantra.

38:57.614 --> 39:00.116
Oh, yes.

39:00.216 --> 39:02.086
I thought you wanted to
visit the sacred caves.

39:02.186 --> 39:05.122
I do. Could you meet me
outside in ten minutes?

39:05.222 --> 39:07.959
If I don't finish my meditation...

39:08.059 --> 39:11.095
I tend to get a little cranky.

39:11.195 --> 39:14.531
- Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.
- Bye. Bye.

39:22.289 --> 39:26.140
Well, everything here seems good!
Big load off my mind. Oh, God,

39:26.241 --> 39:29.330
you can speculate all you want, you know,
but unless you check it out for yourself,

39:29.430 --> 39:31.832
you never know.
We should head back now.

39:31.932 --> 39:33.834
Don't you think you
should investigate?

39:33.934 --> 39:38.672
There's no reason to go in there... ever.
I sense it as a holy man.

39:38.772 --> 39:40.875
- But I thought you said...
- It's dark!

39:41.175 --> 39:43.710
I could fall into a precipice.

39:43.810 --> 39:45.144
Here. Take this.

39:47.047 --> 39:50.316
Spank you, Helpy Helperton.

40:11.271 --> 40:13.872
I am not afraid.

40:15.975 --> 40:19.745
I am not afraid.

40:23.983 --> 40:26.619
I really like it here.

40:43.703 --> 40:45.271
My medallion.

40:50.210 --> 40:55.515
I will fear no living creature as
long as I keep this near me.

40:56.717 --> 41:01.021
Take that, you winged spawn of Satan!

41:06.826 --> 41:08.727
That's ok.

41:11.030 --> 41:13.353
All I really need is my torch.

41:13.901 --> 41:16.314
Die, devil bird!

41:20.340 --> 41:22.042
I'm ok.

41:27.047 --> 41:29.049
Get away!

41:29.349 --> 41:30.983
They're in my hair!

41:31.118 --> 41:33.154
They're in my hair!

41:34.054 --> 41:37.458
Oh, God in heaven, help me!

41:37.558 --> 41:41.660
Ace, there is nothing in your hair.

41:43.063 --> 41:47.533
Exactly. I was merely
running a drill.

41:52.773 --> 41:54.875
Just as I suspected.

41:55.075 --> 41:57.311
- Quinn.
- What?

41:57.611 --> 41:59.546
We met him at Cadby's soiree.

41:59.646 --> 42:02.917
His bird is a raven named Tinky.
I found that inside the cave.

42:03.017 --> 42:06.587
Ace, now, you don't understand.
Burton Quinn is a very powerful man.

42:06.687 --> 42:08.589
Worry not, my brother...

42:09.289 --> 42:11.192
For I...

42:11.592 --> 42:13.393
am a master...

42:13.493 --> 42:16.062
of disguises.

42:26.406 --> 42:31.378
<i>There's a man who leads
a life of danger</i>

42:31.878 --> 42:36.883
<i>To everyone he meets,
he stays a stranger</i>

42:36.983 --> 42:42.923
<i>Oh, with every move he makes,
another chance he takes</i>

42:43.023 --> 42:47.494
<i>Odds are he won't live
to see tomorrow</i>

42:47.694 --> 42:53.450
<i>Secret agent man, secret agent man</i>

42:53.550 --> 42:59.322
<i>They've given you a number
and taken away your name</i>

43:09.465 --> 43:12.969
Eat up, guys. None of
this animal goes to waste.

43:14.404 --> 43:16.840
<i>Be careful what you say</i>

43:16.940 --> 43:20.077
<i>Or you'll give yourself away</i>

43:20.177 --> 43:24.881
<i>Odds are you won't
live to see tomorrow</i>

43:24.981 --> 43:30.687
<i>Secret agent man, secret agent man</i>

43:30.787 --> 43:36.692
<i>They've given you a number
and taken away your name</i>

43:45.936 --> 43:48.439
Mr. McCane.

43:48.539 --> 43:49.940
How are you doing?

43:50.040 --> 43:52.943
I'm... I'm... I'm doing well,
thank you.

43:59.650 --> 44:02.453
Don't mind me, Mr. Quinn.

44:03.053 --> 44:05.656
I'm just a curious little rhino.

44:05.856 --> 44:07.958
I appreciate your...

44:08.058 --> 44:10.261
agreeing to undertake this.

44:18.469 --> 44:22.873
Meeting secretly with
sinister types much?

44:22.973 --> 44:25.876
Ah, not too much. Ah, much too much.

44:39.856 --> 44:43.459
I'll pay your fee...
the sum we've agreed upon.

44:47.865 --> 44:50.967
Kind of hot in these rhinos.

45:02.379 --> 45:03.913
Warm!

45:11.288 --> 45:16.559
I had a dog, and his
name was... Bingo!

45:19.129 --> 45:21.531
Oh, time to get some oxygen.

45:25.102 --> 45:27.069
Oh, no.

45:27.871 --> 45:29.573
Come on!

45:40.084 --> 45:41.985
Mayday!

45:49.025 --> 45:53.030
Must... have... air!

46:16.153 --> 46:17.287
Come on, girls.

46:19.390 --> 46:21.858
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
Look. Take a look.

46:25.596 --> 46:30.500
Oh, look. The mother
rhino is giving birth.

46:34.605 --> 46:36.639
Oh, God.

46:56.493 --> 46:57.693
Mommy!

47:08.405 --> 47:09.840
Cool!

47:10.140 --> 47:15.112
- Go, Annie! Get out of here!
- Get in the jeep! Quick, girls! Get in!

47:15.912 --> 47:18.144
Welcome to Quinnland.

47:20.417 --> 47:22.419
And you, too, my friend.

47:24.521 --> 47:28.926
Yes. Yes. I know
you'll be happy here.

47:37.034 --> 47:39.369
Well, how did you
get out, little fella?

47:41.471 --> 47:43.806
You're a cute little devil,
aren't you?

47:45.209 --> 47:46.677
What's that you got there?

48:05.062 --> 48:07.264
Where's the bat?

48:07.564 --> 48:10.567
What is this about? Who are you?

48:11.769 --> 48:16.607
Where is the bat?

48:16.807 --> 48:20.878
I know who you are.
I met you at Cadby's!

48:20.978 --> 48:24.014
You're that... Ventura fella!

48:24.114 --> 48:26.515
Last chance!

48:28.285 --> 48:30.921
Where is that darn bat?

48:31.121 --> 48:32.990
What are you going to do?

48:33.090 --> 48:34.925
What are you going to do?

48:35.025 --> 48:38.527
Whatever I have to
to get some answers.

48:46.170 --> 48:49.039
Stop that! Stop it! Stop that!

48:49.339 --> 48:53.643
You'd like me to stop that,
wouldn't you? Getting to you?

48:54.243 --> 48:56.246
I'll never tell you anything.

49:03.821 --> 49:05.288
Ooh...

49:05.923 --> 49:07.725
A tough guy?

49:08.025 --> 49:10.728
I know what to do with tough guys.

49:10.828 --> 49:12.129
Wheee!

49:19.837 --> 49:21.739
No!

49:22.039 --> 49:23.974
My brother used to do that to me!

49:24.274 --> 49:27.644
Oh, you sadistic bastard!
Stop it! Stop it!

49:27.744 --> 49:30.314
- All right, I'll talk!
- Spill it!

49:30.414 --> 49:34.417
I paid Derrick McCane
to find the bat.

49:37.187 --> 49:42.559
I thought it could be an attraction.
Business has been a bit off lately.

49:42.659 --> 49:44.561
So...

49:45.261 --> 49:47.830
you don't know who...

49:49.632 --> 49:52.169
- took the bat?
- Neither does McCane!

49:52.269 --> 49:53.802
Ok.

49:59.275 --> 50:01.678
I'm going to untie you now...

50:02.278 --> 50:07.717
But before I do, I want you to
know that I'm really, truly, very...

50:07.817 --> 50:09.119
Sorry!

50:14.591 --> 50:18.194
Appreciate the lift!
We'll walk from here.

50:20.097 --> 50:22.198
<i>Shikaka!</i>

50:22.366 --> 50:26.503
Ok, Quinn is out of the picture.
We have no more suspects or clues,

50:26.603 --> 50:31.308
but I have instincts, Spike, and my
instincts tell me we're getting closer.

50:31.608 --> 50:36.013
I can feel it. I can
feel it like it's right...

50:36.513 --> 50:39.182
in my neck! Run!

50:45.922 --> 50:47.858
Starting to get numb!

50:55.632 --> 51:00.236
Three darts is too much.

51:30.667 --> 51:34.770
I think I lost them.

51:38.976 --> 51:42.278
Hey!

52:04.701 --> 52:08.105
Flowers... for me?

52:08.405 --> 52:12.308
I do declare, Mr. Beauregard.

52:13.410 --> 52:16.512
You are my hero.

52:22.219 --> 52:24.121
Was I...

52:24.221 --> 52:27.057
- talking in my sleep?
- You've been suffering hysteria.

52:27.157 --> 52:30.127
It's a natural reaction to
the poison in these darts.

52:30.227 --> 52:31.793
Water.

52:39.101 --> 52:41.604
Guano bowls.

52:42.004 --> 52:43.740
Collect the whole set.

52:43.840 --> 52:46.309
Ace, did you see the shooter?

52:46.409 --> 52:50.113
Only their feet.
Not enough for a positive I.D.

52:50.213 --> 52:52.183
That is the dart of the
Wachootoo shaman.

52:53.183 --> 52:56.253
- The Whaty Whatan?
- The Wachootoo shaman, or medicine man,

52:56.353 --> 52:59.555
has openly protested against
the intertribal wedding.

53:02.725 --> 53:05.494
Has he?

53:06.529 --> 53:10.033
- But you do not speak Wachootoo.
- I go with you.

53:10.133 --> 53:12.936
Yes. Ouda will be my interpreter.

53:13.036 --> 53:14.538
Ace!

53:15.638 --> 53:18.842
Now, please take care.
The Wachootoo are a savage tribe.

53:18.942 --> 53:21.645
If they catch you,
they'll show no mercy.

53:22.345 --> 53:23.780
Worry not, my brother.

53:24.480 --> 53:28.352
I will be as a fly on the wall,
a grain of salt in the ocean.

53:28.452 --> 53:32.121
I will slip amongst them
like a transparent...

53:33.856 --> 53:35.757
thing.

54:01.251 --> 54:03.653
The sacred bat has got to
be in one of those huts,

54:03.753 --> 54:06.789
but we'll never know until I
can walk freely among them.

54:10.460 --> 54:15.231
<i>"Wunderbar!"</i> He exclaimed
with great relish.

54:39.422 --> 54:43.626
Come on, girls! Show them
what you got! Oh! Big finish!

54:59.109 --> 55:03.246
I'm sure it's fine. Ouda is
probably going for help right now.

55:03.446 --> 55:04.714
Hello, Ace!

55:04.914 --> 55:08.217
They found me. No sweat!

55:10.620 --> 55:12.854
Don't beat yourself up.

55:21.198 --> 55:22.843
You know,

55:22.943 --> 55:26.836
gingivitis is the number-one
cause of all tooth decay.

55:26.936 --> 55:29.805
<i>Equinsu ocha!</i>

55:31.775 --> 55:34.978
- What does <i>equinsu ocha</i> mean?
- White devil.

55:35.578 --> 55:39.683
- Well, tell them I'm not.
- I've only met you. How do I know?

55:40.083 --> 55:42.986
<i>Equinsu ocha! Equinsu ocha!</i>

55:43.786 --> 55:46.191
- He said...
- Let me guess. "White devil, white devil"?

55:46.291 --> 55:48.792
Yes. You speak Wachootoo?

55:48.892 --> 55:50.959
Tell them what I'm saying.

55:52.295 --> 55:55.032
I come in peace!

55:55.132 --> 55:58.600
<i>Equinsu ocha uza inkosazana.</i>

56:02.138 --> 56:04.740
I couldn't help but notice
that <i>equinsu ocha</i> part.

56:04.840 --> 56:08.512
- Did you just refer to me as white devil?
- This how they know you.

56:08.612 --> 56:10.780
Leave that part out from now on.

56:11.780 --> 56:14.851
I represent the princess!

56:24.160 --> 56:27.063
War... is hell.

56:27.163 --> 56:29.665
The last thing we want...

56:31.067 --> 56:32.635
is a fight.

56:47.417 --> 56:53.088
The chief said, if you pass all
Wachootoo tests, you do not die.

56:56.526 --> 56:58.726
Kooky.

57:00.630 --> 57:04.467
<i>Ooh, abba wah, ay bay abba wah</i>

57:04.567 --> 57:08.004
<i>Abba wah, ay bay abba wah</i>

57:08.104 --> 57:11.707
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>

57:11.807 --> 57:15.345
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>

57:27.156 --> 57:29.157
Yeah!

57:35.598 --> 57:38.701
<i>You can make me out to be a fool</i>

57:38.801 --> 57:42.070
<i>Even say I lost my mind</i>

57:43.006 --> 57:46.276
<i>I know in my heart there's no room</i>

57:46.376 --> 57:49.777
<i>You're the one I need to find</i>

57:50.880 --> 57:53.917
<i>Sometimes at night, I feel alone</i>

57:54.017 --> 57:56.752
<i>And I know I need someone</i>

57:58.488 --> 58:02.092
<i>To hold my hand and carry me home</i>

58:02.492 --> 58:05.696
<i>My ancestor, I'm lost in the storm</i>

58:05.796 --> 58:07.831
<i>Abba
I'm what you need</i>

58:07.931 --> 58:10.000
<i>Abba
I lean on you</i>

58:10.100 --> 58:11.968
<i>Abba
I have my faith in you</i>

58:12.068 --> 58:13.769
<i>Abba
Let me call your name</i>

58:13.869 --> 58:15.672
<i>Abba
I'm what you need</i>

58:15.772 --> 58:17.674
<i>Abba
Let me see your face</i>

58:17.774 --> 58:19.642
<i>Abba
Take me to your place</i>

58:19.742 --> 58:21.344
<i>Abba</i>

58:21.644 --> 58:23.779
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>

58:23.879 --> 58:25.481
<i>Bay abba wah</i>

58:29.019 --> 58:32.322
My entrance to the winner's circle.

58:32.422 --> 58:36.326
Your admiration is well-founded,
but I'm merely a servant.

58:36.426 --> 58:37.994
Do not worship me!

58:48.921 --> 58:52.391
Chief says you have
passed all tests but one.

58:52.491 --> 58:55.895
Only left is Wachootoo
circle of death.

58:55.995 --> 58:59.398
Funny... that's my specialty.

59:35.785 --> 59:39.722
This is it? I have to beat him?

59:51.920 --> 59:54.703
Alrighty, then.

59:56.805 --> 59:58.973
I must tell you...

01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:02.278
I do not wish to fight you.

01:00:03.546 --> 01:00:09.651
Violence is no longer in my nature,
but if you want it, you got it, sister!

01:00:15.458 --> 01:00:17.693
Biting, I see.

01:00:17.793 --> 01:00:20.696
I was unaware that the Wachootoos...

01:00:21.196 --> 01:00:23.098
were biters!

01:00:24.198 --> 01:00:27.836
Well, why don't you try
this on and see how it fits?

01:00:31.807 --> 01:00:33.009
Ace...

01:00:33.909 --> 01:00:36.046
He much better fighter than you.

01:00:36.146 --> 01:00:37.712
Doii!

01:00:47.323 --> 01:00:49.225
<i>Equinsu ocha!</i>

01:00:54.664 --> 01:00:59.236
All right! This white devil
thing has gone far enough.

01:00:59.636 --> 01:01:04.473
Nobody messes with the "do"!

01:01:19.355 --> 01:01:20.990
<i>Equinsu ocha...</i>

01:01:22.759 --> 01:01:26.629
He said sorry, white devil,
but he must kill you now.

01:01:28.564 --> 01:01:33.671
I'll have you know I have the reflexes
of a cat and the speed of a mongoose.

01:01:33.771 --> 01:01:37.040
Throw it. I dare you!

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:57.125
Ouda, don't just stand there.
Throw me a spear!

01:02:25.221 --> 01:02:28.191
It's in the bone. It's in the bone.

01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:30.710
It's in the bone.

01:02:48.494 --> 01:02:53.199
Chief says you make him laugh.
You are like sissy girl.

01:03:02.308 --> 01:03:03.810
Sissy girl.

01:03:09.014 --> 01:03:12.218
Wachootoo chief say
you friend to Wachootoo.

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:24.313
But if curse of <i>shikaka</i> not lifted
by tomorrow's sun at top of sky,

01:03:24.413 --> 01:03:28.616
Wachootoo kill all Wachati and
smash your head on a rock.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.723
Super. Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

01:03:34.823 --> 01:03:37.925
Ok. Take care. Super. Bye-bye, then.

01:03:39.328 --> 01:03:42.431
Are your legs sore?
Do you want me to carry you?

01:03:42.831 --> 01:03:44.733
That won't be necessary, my friend.

01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:48.903
I have an incredibly high threshold
for pain. Holy monkey!

01:04:13.379 --> 01:04:15.680
Ace, why you stopped?

01:04:17.383 --> 01:04:19.984
The Wachootoo didn't take <i>shikaka.</i>

01:04:22.889 --> 01:04:25.330
Hi. Welcome back.

01:04:25.431 --> 01:04:28.784
- What would you say this is?
- Dart of Wachootoo shaman.

01:04:29.285 --> 01:04:33.232
Precisely. And when compared to
one of the darts that hit me before?

01:04:33.332 --> 01:04:34.434
Same.

01:04:35.034 --> 01:04:37.703
Only to the untrained eye.

01:04:37.803 --> 01:04:41.308
You see, the Wachootoo dart is
made of wood from a mimosa tree,

01:04:41.408 --> 01:04:46.013
while the other dart is carved
from a red fungus-bearing acalla.

01:04:46.113 --> 01:04:51.652
And there's only one area of the jungle
with red fungus-bearing acallas.

01:04:52.452 --> 01:04:56.222
Go back to the village. Tell them the
Wachootoos attack tomorrow at noon.

01:04:56.322 --> 01:04:57.788
Ok.

01:05:00.126 --> 01:05:03.730
This little hound dog
just picked up a scent.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.009
Won't be long now, Katie.

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:23.783
Big night tonight. You're going
to meet your new owner.

01:05:24.683 --> 01:05:27.363
G'day. Disgusting rat.

01:05:43.803 --> 01:05:46.204
Gravy.

01:05:50.825 --> 01:05:52.910
Did you hear that?

01:05:53.646 --> 01:05:57.199
- What is it?
- Silverback.

01:06:07.793 --> 01:06:09.739
Female.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.165
- Big.
- Yeah?

01:06:12.265 --> 01:06:14.769
About 200 meters...

01:06:15.669 --> 01:06:17.169
south.

01:06:17.769 --> 01:06:21.707
- We'd get $5,000 for one of those.
- What about the rat?

01:06:21.807 --> 01:06:25.059
Don't worry about the rat.
We'll be back in no time.

01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:32.367
Stay downwind.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.601
You're even uglier than I thought.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.605
She's a big one, isn't she?

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:15.578
Oh, boy. Deciduous trees
lining the riverbank.

01:07:16.178 --> 01:07:20.349
Suman shrubs with extreme protococcus.
Steadily increasing water current.

01:07:20.449 --> 01:07:25.987
Spike, I think we can assume the
stream gets pretty rough up ahead.

01:07:35.813 --> 01:07:39.317
As soon as I get you loose, Spike,
you can chew through my ropes.

01:07:45.825 --> 01:07:47.776
That's it! That's it!

01:07:49.477 --> 01:07:50.878
Yes! Your turn.

01:07:54.217 --> 01:07:56.486
All right! Yes!

01:08:03.842 --> 01:08:07.246
Hey! Spike! Spike!

01:08:08.246 --> 01:08:10.216
Spike!

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.320
Spi...

01:08:32.221 --> 01:08:34.576
ike!

01:08:39.395 --> 01:08:41.147
I'm alive.

01:08:43.549 --> 01:08:46.651
I'm alive!

01:08:57.946 --> 01:09:01.099
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!

01:09:01.499 --> 01:09:03.468
Say "Uncle"! Say "Uncle"!

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:08.658
Oh, no.

01:09:09.457 --> 01:09:12.428
Don't start what you can't finish!

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:18.167
Quit hitting yourself. Quit hitting
yourself. Quit hitting yourself.

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:21.587
Oh, water tastes good, yes.

01:09:21.687 --> 01:09:24.471
Glub, glub!

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.531
This isn't over yet.
There's something I've missed,

01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:37.736
some clue I've overlooked,
some motive, and that motive is...

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:41.238
Pluh! Think!

01:09:41.339 --> 01:09:43.741
Somebody wants these two
tribes to destroy each other.

01:09:43.841 --> 01:09:46.845
There must be something
valuable in this equation.

01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:49.448
Perhaps we should
meditate upon it, Spike,

01:09:49.548 --> 01:09:52.852
for it is said that when
seeking answers, one must...

01:09:52.953 --> 01:09:55.954
quiet the soul in order to hear them.

01:10:00.558 --> 01:10:06.264
What is it the Wachatis possess
that is of great value to other men...

01:10:06.364 --> 01:10:09.768
besides the princess
with the amazing rack.

01:10:20.379 --> 01:10:24.266
<i>Alrighty, then</i>

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:36.361
<i>Alrighty, then</i>

01:11:05.407 --> 01:11:09.745
Oh, Ace. You're back?

01:11:11.245 --> 01:11:14.249
You can dispense with
the smallpox, all-knowing one.

01:11:14.349 --> 01:11:18.354
I'm here on business,
and time is of the essence.

01:11:18.754 --> 01:11:22.357
Very well. What answer do you seek?

01:11:22.457 --> 01:11:24.860
I need to know what it
is the Wachatis possess

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.996
that is of great value
to civilized man.

01:11:28.096 --> 01:11:32.485
The medallion will lead
you to the answer.

01:11:33.285 --> 01:11:36.521
You do still have
the medallion, don't you?

01:11:36.621 --> 01:11:39.991
Medallion? Why... surely.

01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:44.630
I left it back... with my body.

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:49.151
Your aura is weakening.

01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:53.689
Ok, I threw it in the cave!
What do you want from me?

01:11:53.789 --> 01:11:56.894
What are you, Mr. Perfect?
You want to know where it is?

01:11:57.394 --> 01:11:59.409
It's probably lying...

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:03.397
in a big pile of...

01:12:18.513 --> 01:12:20.316
Guano!

01:12:21.116 --> 01:12:24.885
They have guano!

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:36.832
Like...

01:12:36.933 --> 01:12:39.049
a glove.

01:12:42.354 --> 01:12:44.156
Hi, chief.

01:12:44.356 --> 01:12:46.457
Appreciate your meeting me here.

01:12:47.859 --> 01:12:49.960
Let's go kick some...

01:12:51.363 --> 01:12:53.464
consulate butt.

01:13:03.392 --> 01:13:04.760
Hello, Ace.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:09.514
- You've come for your money?
- Wrong again, Sweeney Toad.

01:13:09.614 --> 01:13:12.634
I've come for the sacred bat.
Where is it?

01:13:12.734 --> 01:13:15.737
Why, Ace, whatever can you mean?

01:13:15.837 --> 01:13:18.607
Guano. Hello.

01:13:18.707 --> 01:13:20.742
Does "poo" ring a bell?

01:13:22.042 --> 01:13:24.542
"Guano mines as a source of nitrate,

01:13:24.643 --> 01:13:29.848
producing 84% of the world's supply
of fertilizer, a $1.4 billion industry."

01:13:29.949 --> 01:13:32.237
That's what this war is all about.

01:13:32.537 --> 01:13:34.607
You can't legally take
possession of the caves

01:13:34.707 --> 01:13:37.459
as long as the Wachatis
inhabit the area,

01:13:37.559 --> 01:13:41.679
and you want that dookie
so bad, you can taste it.

01:13:41.779 --> 01:13:45.734
- But, sir, I thought that...
- Yes. Thank you, Fulton.

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:52.791
That's a fine theory, Mr. Ventura.
What has it got to do with me?

01:13:53.791 --> 01:13:57.328
I thought you'd never ask.

01:14:01.465 --> 01:14:04.261
The day I met you, there was a white substance
on your shoe that I mistook for plaster.

01:14:04.362 --> 01:14:06.901
Yesterday, I saw the same white substance
outside the hut where the bat was kept,

01:14:07.002 --> 01:14:10.222
and suddenly it hit me. The great
white bat has great white guano.

01:14:10.323 --> 01:14:12.546
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

01:14:12.647 --> 01:14:15.430
And that explains the
abrasion on your palm!

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:17.666
Let me run that back for you.

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:25.408
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

01:14:25.508 --> 01:14:29.845
And that explains the
abrasion on your palm!

01:14:30.445 --> 01:14:34.182
Damn, I'm good! Can you feel that?

01:14:34.282 --> 01:14:37.285
Can you feel it, captain compost?

01:14:37.585 --> 01:14:42.873
The day of redemption is at hand!

01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:45.249
Repent!

01:14:45.449 --> 01:14:50.106
And thou shall be saved.

01:14:50.849 --> 01:14:54.122
Very good, Mr. Ventura.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:58.657
Very good. I believe
you've solved the case.

01:14:58.757 --> 01:15:02.377
One thing I still don't understand,
Mr. Belvedere.

01:15:03.177 --> 01:15:06.682
If you are the slime
behind this little flimflam,

01:15:06.782 --> 01:15:11.353
why, oh, why did you hire me?

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:14.689
I'm afraid there's going to be a
horrendous investigation after the war.

01:15:14.823 --> 01:15:19.227
You were my alibi to prove I'd
done everything I could to stop it.

01:15:19.327 --> 01:15:22.413
Arrest him. Arrest him!

01:15:25.217 --> 01:15:26.817
Please, arrest him.

01:15:28.237 --> 01:15:30.572
Simon says, "arrest him."

01:15:39.832 --> 01:15:43.635
I thought you loved
all animals, Mr. Ventura.

01:15:43.735 --> 01:15:47.256
"I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura."

01:15:49.056 --> 01:15:51.460
Shall I stick him on the wall?

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.346
No. I don't think it'll
be necessary, Gahjii.

01:15:55.446 --> 01:15:59.701
Mr. Ventura here has very cleverly
stolen the sacred bat of the Wachati.

01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:04.038
Unfortunately, we were unable to
recover it in time to stop the war.

01:16:05.807 --> 01:16:07.076
Greenwall, hit the lights!

01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:11.745
The switch on the wall
beside you... go for it!

01:16:21.389 --> 01:16:23.357
Flick it, quick!

01:16:26.995 --> 01:16:30.597
Alrighty, then. Shall we go to jail?

01:16:40.307 --> 01:16:43.827
Hey, what are you,
H.R. Shove-n-stuff?

01:16:44.914 --> 01:16:45.946
Get in!

01:16:47.799 --> 01:16:49.717
Just one more thing...

01:16:57.159 --> 01:16:58.593
What are you doing?

01:17:04.699 --> 01:17:06.902
Stop it! I said stop it!

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.478
To the jungle, Boba.

01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:36.828
Friends, rodents,

01:17:36.929 --> 01:17:38.633
quadrupeds,

01:17:38.733 --> 01:17:41.752
lend me "your ears"!

01:17:49.343 --> 01:17:51.462
Imbecile! You let him get away.

01:17:51.562 --> 01:17:54.666
Sir, you don't seem to understand.
The entire tribe will be killed.

01:17:54.766 --> 01:17:58.670
- Remind me to send a sympathy card.
- We'll go and get the bastard.

01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:00.773
Doesn't matter, Gahjii.
There's nothing he can do now.

01:18:00.873 --> 01:18:03.776
We've got the bat,
and it's nearly noon.

01:18:21.109 --> 01:18:23.143
What the hell is going on?

01:19:04.136 --> 01:19:06.003
You see...

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:11.359
humans and animals
can live in harmony.

01:19:21.019 --> 01:19:23.755
Wow.

01:19:23.855 --> 01:19:26.491
Sorry for the delay, Ace.

01:19:30.194 --> 01:19:31.997
Hey, poachers!

01:19:32.497 --> 01:19:37.002
Say hello to my stinky little friend.

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:56.688
Get off, get off, get off.

01:19:57.788 --> 01:20:00.758
Not so fast, Sally.

01:20:03.271 --> 01:20:05.129
Get it away!

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:25.532
<i>Shikaka!</i>

01:21:02.937 --> 01:21:06.173
Aw, he wants to go off-road.

01:21:11.846 --> 01:21:15.315
Nobody wants to play with me.

01:21:22.457 --> 01:21:28.195
Loser!

01:21:38.806 --> 01:21:41.877
Cadby! From the consulate, right?

01:21:42.777 --> 01:21:44.311
This is weird.

01:22:47.308 --> 01:22:48.725
Bleah.

01:22:50.728 --> 01:22:51.845
Noon.

01:22:54.516 --> 01:22:56.650
The Wachati.

01:22:59.637 --> 01:23:02.006
The spirit will overcome.

01:23:02.506 --> 01:23:04.908
The spirit will overcome.

01:23:09.013 --> 01:23:10.248
<i>Shikaka!</i>

01:23:40.011 --> 01:23:41.528
Headhunters!

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.875
Wachootoo!

01:24:04.869 --> 01:24:07.610
<i>Shikaka!</i>

01:24:17.331 --> 01:24:20.518
Pet Detective coming through.
Clear a path, people!

01:24:20.618 --> 01:24:22.135
<i>Shikaka!</i>

01:24:27.241 --> 01:24:29.710
<i>Equinsu ocha! Equinsu ocha!</i>

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:56.586
Yuck!

01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:22.564
<i>Wee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee</i>

01:25:22.764 --> 01:25:26.133
<i>Dee, owimoweh</i>

01:25:26.233 --> 01:25:29.904
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh,
owimoweh, owimoweh</i>

01:25:30.004 --> 01:25:33.808
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh,
owimoweh, owimoweh...</i>

01:25:54.112 --> 01:25:57.649
They will now consummate the marriage
under the witness of the tribe.

01:25:57.749 --> 01:26:01.552
Well done, Ace.
You must be extremely proud.

01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:05.857
Pride is an abomination.
One must forgo the self

01:26:05.957 --> 01:26:11.363
to attain total spiritual creaminess
and avoid the chewy chunks

01:26:11.763 --> 01:26:13.665
of degradation.

01:26:21.956 --> 01:26:23.157
What's that he's saying?

01:26:23.257 --> 01:26:26.478
Well, I think he's saying
she's not a virgin.

01:26:27.778 --> 01:26:29.180
They can tell that?

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.031
<i>Shikaka!</i>

01:27:04.315 --> 01:27:06.900
<i>Shikaka!</i>

01:27:09.003 --> 01:27:13.073
<i>There is no political solution</i>

01:27:16.778 --> 01:27:20.714
<i>To our troubled evolution</i>

01:27:23.885 --> 01:27:28.023
<i>I have no faith in constitution</i>

01:27:28.123 --> 01:27:30.424
<i>No, no</i>

01:27:30.524 --> 01:27:35.062
<i>Just check this reggae revolution</i>

01:27:36.932 --> 01:27:40.802
<i>We are spirits in the material world</i>

01:27:40.902 --> 01:27:44.472
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:27:44.572 --> 01:27:48.076
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:27:48.176 --> 01:27:52.281
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:27:52.781 --> 01:27:56.082
<i>Our so-called leaders speak</i>

01:27:59.788 --> 01:28:03.524
<i>With words they try to jail you</i>

01:28:03.624 --> 01:28:06.961
<i>What's the right?</i>

01:28:07.061 --> 01:28:10.766
<i>They subjugate the meek</i>

01:28:11.266 --> 01:28:13.702
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

01:28:13.802 --> 01:28:18.440
<i>But it's the rhetoric of failure</i>

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.678
<i>We are spirits in the material world</i>

01:28:23.778 --> 01:28:27.215
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:28:27.315 --> 01:28:30.719
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:28:30.819 --> 01:28:36.957
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:28:39.194 --> 01:28:40.561
<i>Watch this</i>

01:28:40.661 --> 01:28:44.332
<i>So come, come, come,
every posse, come, come, come</i>

01:28:44.432 --> 01:28:46.067
<i>Come, come listen to the words</i>

01:28:46.167 --> 01:28:47.902
<i>Of Mr. P-A-T-O Banton</i>

01:28:48.002 --> 01:28:51.339
<i>I must be a real gentleman
in this material land</i>

01:28:51.439 --> 01:28:55.009
<i>Spreading peace and love
to each and every one</i>

01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:58.412
<i>So PATO is your one
from the radio station</i>

01:28:58.512 --> 01:29:02.217
<i>I'm on the airwaves
with positive vibration</i>

01:29:02.317 --> 01:29:05.620
<i>Do you need spiritual education?</i>

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.990
<i>That's the only way they'll
ever know their destination</i>

01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:11.525
<i>We are spiritual, material</i>

01:29:11.625 --> 01:29:16.798
<i>Yes, we are spiritual
in this material world</i>

01:29:16.898 --> 01:29:20.468
<i>Oh, oh, my, my</i>

01:29:20.568 --> 01:29:23.404
<i>How easy I go</i>

01:29:23.504 --> 01:29:27.943
<i>Oh, oh, my, my</i>

01:29:28.943 --> 01:29:30.844
<i>Watch this</i>

01:29:32.613 --> 01:29:35.749
<i>Where does the answer lie?</i>

01:29:39.487 --> 01:29:42.922
<i>Living from day to day</i>

01:29:46.427 --> 01:29:50.698
<i>And for something we can buy</i>

01:29:50.798 --> 01:29:53.301
<i>Ooh, yeah</i>

01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:57.938
<i>There must be another way</i>

01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:03.277
<i>We are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:03.377 --> 01:30:06.682
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:06.782 --> 01:30:10.451
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:10.551 --> 01:30:13.688
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:13.788 --> 01:30:17.425
<i>We are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:17.525 --> 01:30:21.062
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:21.162 --> 01:30:24.600
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:28.201
<i>Are spirits in the material world</i>

01:30:33.441 --> 01:30:34.908
<i>Get down</i>

01:30:37.645 --> 01:30:39.912
<i>Let me tell you about
a friend of mine</i>

01:30:43.652 --> 01:30:45.219
<i>His name's Boll Weevil,
check him out</i>

01:30:45.319 --> 01:30:48.623
<i>He spends all day on his big butt</i>

01:30:48.723 --> 01:30:52.460
<i>And he don't ever, ever get outside</i>

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:56.531
<i>I come to visit
I bring some sunshine</i>

01:30:56.631 --> 01:31:00.535
<i>And I just spread it
all over the fire</i>

01:31:00.635 --> 01:31:04.573
<i>He's stuck on his big couch
Stuck in his big shell</i>

01:31:04.673 --> 01:31:08.642
<i>He looks at the TV,
and he's all right</i>

01:31:08.742 --> 01:31:12.581
<i>I come from the drug lord,
the local drugstore</i>

01:31:12.681 --> 01:31:16.484
<i>Bug is a fly, baby,
he's never uptight</i>

01:31:16.584 --> 01:31:17.651
<i>And I wonder</i>

01:31:17.751 --> 01:31:21.389
<i>Boll Weevil, why don't you
get out of your home?</i>

01:31:21.489 --> 01:31:23.291
<i>He said, "I'm comfortable here"</i>

01:31:23.391 --> 01:31:25.359
<i>"I don't want to move,
I don't want to leave"</i>

01:31:25.459 --> 01:31:29.731
<i>I said, "Boll Weevil,
get right out of your home"</i>

01:31:30.131 --> 01:31:32.333
<i>"Good-bye, I got to stay,
