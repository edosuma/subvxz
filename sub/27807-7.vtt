slave quarters

28:44.457 --> 28:47.458
started about here
and extended this way.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.094

they had 192 slaves...

28:50.096 --> 28:51.195
Wow!

28:51.197 --> 28:53.130
...at one point
on this property,

28:53.132 --> 28:54.164

28:54.166 --> 28:58.936
There was an overseer,
who I guess --

28:58.938 --> 29:00.404
did he manage?

29:00.406 --> 29:01.805
What was his job?

29:01.807 --> 29:03.640
The overseer was the white man
on the plantation

29:03.642 --> 29:05.709
who was in charge
of working the slaves.

29:05.711 --> 29:09.046

any kind of punishing,

29:09.048 --> 29:10.781

in charge of --

29:10.783 --> 29:12.416
Yeah, he would do punishing,
as well.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.885

Okay.

speculation.

He was one of the last overseers
at Belle Grove.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.224
We asked him at one point,
you know,

39:21.226 --> 39:23.126
"What happened to you?"
- "Did something bad happen?"

39:23.128 --> 39:24.494
"Did something bad happen
to you?"

39:24.496 --> 39:25.762

39:30.335 --> 39:31.668
<i> Have you ever tried to leave?</i>
Suicide.

39:31.670 --> 39:32.902
Yeah.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.437
He committed suicide
by slitting his own throat

39:34.439 --> 39:35.972
with a straight razor.
- Ooh!

39:35.974 --> 39:37.407
Yeah, it's more graphic

39:37.409 --> 39:39.476
than you could
possibly imagine.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.311
And so we feel like
what happened

39:41.313 --> 39:45.248
is he's such
a conflicted character

39:45.250 --> 39:48.651
because he's someone
that we hate what he did,

39:48.653 --> 39:51.254
and we're not justifying
any of it.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.056
He seems very conflicted.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.924
But what we think happened --

39:54.926 --> 39:57.193
where he's come back here
is like --

39:57.195 --> 39:58.762
almost like a self-imposed
sentence.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.497
Like, we find this sometimes.

40:00.499 --> 40:04.100
For him, we suspect
he's very regretful

40:04.102 --> 40:06.136
and that he is not
going to leave

40:06.138 --> 40:08.905
because he doesn't feel like
he deserves to move on.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.441
So, that being said,
what we would love

40:11.443 --> 40:14.244
for you to do,
and we will go with you --

40:14.246 --> 40:16.312

40:21.987 --> 40:25.121
We just know
if you talk to him,

40:25.123 --> 40:28.758
you actually might start feeling
more comfortable in that space,

40:28.760 --> 40:30.593
enough to do something with it.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.763
It's just -- It's like you guys

41:11.269 --> 41:14.537
Amy and Adam
are back with Michelle.

41:14.539 --> 41:17.674
Baldwin, this is Michelle.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.008
You're okay.
You got this.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.979
♪♪

41:22.981 --> 41:24.614
No.
- No?

41:24.616 --> 41:25.949
- No.
- Okay.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.750
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, you're good.

41:27.752 --> 41:31.254
- It's okay. It's all right.
- You're good.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.922
BERRY:
It's one step at a time.

41:32.924 --> 41:40.363
♪♪

41:40.365 --> 41:41.998
- I know.
- What are you feeling?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.501
This has to be something
between he and I by ourselves.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.603
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:46.605 --> 41:51.741
Sometimes it's not a matter
of just an overnight resolution.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.176
Mm-hmm.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.711
And that I feel like
is what's happening here.

41:54.713 --> 41:57.013
- Yeah.
- It'll happen. Just not now.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.114
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.549
- You're good.
- You didn't --

41:59.551 --> 42:01.284
You're standing on the porch,
and you went inside.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.152
We're proud of you.

42:03.154 --> 42:06.723
BRUNI: This particular case was
so much harder than most for us.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.725
It's not always easy separating

42:08.727 --> 42:11.828
our personal feelings
from the evidence.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.496
BERRY: Honestly, that was
a great first step.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.999
The relationship between
Michelle and Baldwin

42:16.001 --> 42:18.101
has always been based on fear,

42:18.103 --> 42:20.904
but maybe Baldwin is somehow
trying to atone

42:20.906 --> 42:23.606
for the sins
he committed in his life.

42:23.608 --> 42:26.042
Our hope is one day
this will allow Michelle

42:26.044 --> 42:29.546
to stand up to him and feel safe
in the caretaker's cottage.
