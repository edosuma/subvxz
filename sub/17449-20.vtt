00:00.625 --> 00:02.500
(man) Previously on Mighty Med .

00:02.583 --> 00:04.291
You have to hear
this dream I had last night.

00:04.375 --> 00:06.417
I was onboard an alien spaceship

00:06.500 --> 00:08.458
that was carrying
something called the Arcturion.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.291
Maybe when you fell
into the construction site,

00:11.375 --> 00:13.333
you touched
something that had been in contact

00:13.417 --> 00:15.333
with the Arcturion,
that's why you had the dream.

00:15.417 --> 00:17.041
Villains are drawn
to the Arcturion's power

00:17.125 --> 00:19.417
without even knowing why,
like moths to the light.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.875
It's an order from Mr. Terror.

00:20.959 --> 00:23.959
Locate Quimby Fletcher and destroy him.

00:24.041 --> 00:25.959
"Roast him over an open flame."

00:28.333 --> 00:30.792
Okay, here's what we know for sure.

00:31.458 --> 00:34.375
One, the spaceship
with the Arcturion in it

00:34.458 --> 00:36.291
is buried underneath the school courtyard,

00:36.917 --> 00:40.417
two, Mr. Terror's put
a hit out on Quimby Fletcher,

00:40.500 --> 00:43.041
AKA Oliver, and three,

00:43.125 --> 00:45.542
I love making speeches
with a pen in my hand.

00:46.917 --> 00:48.250
I don't love it.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.625
Your pen is leaking.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.667
I can't find Horace.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.083
He's busy with his wedding.

00:56.166 --> 00:57.750
And I called the League of Heroes,

00:57.834 --> 00:59.458
but word got out that the Arcturion comic

00:59.542 --> 01:01.709
is based on my dream,
so now no one believes it's real.

01:01.792 --> 01:03.500
The worst part is, the League of Heroes

01:03.583 --> 01:06.792
is on Saturn, so now,
my roaming charges are going to be insane.

01:07.542 --> 01:10.625
Well, I guess it's up to the three of us

01:10.709 --> 01:13.250
to find the Arcturion
before Mr. Terror does.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.959
No. It's too dangerous for Oliver to come.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.792
Mr. Terror wants him dead.

01:17.875 --> 01:20.625
The moment he steps outside, wham!

01:22.625 --> 01:24.875
Please don't make the sound
of me getting destroyed.

01:25.625 --> 01:28.417
I didn't. That was the sound
of a door closing behind you.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.834
This is the sound
of you getting destroyed.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.583
Bang, bang!

01:34.500 --> 01:36.542
Look, I need to come with you guys.

01:36.625 --> 01:39.834
If I don't, you're just gonna argue
the whole time and get nothing done.

01:39.917 --> 01:43.667
Also, I'm afraid the two of you
will make fun of me behind my back.

01:44.959 --> 01:46.500
We don't argue.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.500
We can't help but make fun
of you behind your back.

01:49.583 --> 01:52.583
Have you seen your back? It's really bony.

01:53.917 --> 01:56.125
Oliver, you have to stay here.

01:56.208 --> 01:58.500
Mighty Med is the only place
that you'll be safe.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.542
I doubt if he's even safe here.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.667
Anyone could be working for Mr. Terror,

02:02.750 --> 02:05.041
including that guy
charging at him right now

02:05.125 --> 02:06.125
with a giant sword.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.208
Very funny, Kaz.

02:08.291 --> 02:09.375
(Oliver screams)

02:12.291 --> 02:14.875
Jerome, is it really necessary

02:14.959 --> 02:17.208
to use a sword to cut
off a medical bracelet?

02:23.250 --> 02:24.875
Apparently it is necessary.

02:26.041 --> 02:27.792
I apologize, Jerome. Proceed.

02:32.667 --> 02:33.750

Excuse me, have you seen Tecton?

(screams)

03:25.375 --> 03:27.834
Megahertz, what are you doing here?

03:27.917 --> 03:31.208
Apparently cleaning your footprints
off my freshly mopped floor.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.208
Why is nobody using the shoe
booties like we discussed?

03:35.291 --> 03:37.542
Seriously, people, come on.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.125
I meant why are you a janitor?

03:40.208 --> 03:42.041
I have work duties as part
of my prison sentence.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.709
It's not fair.

03:43.792 --> 03:46.000
Why does Murder Face
get to work in the kitchen?

03:46.083 --> 03:47.583
They know I'm part microwave.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.583
I need to find Tecton.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.875
There's a villain
after me named Mr. Terror,

03:52.959 --> 03:54.250
and he's trying to destroy me.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.083
I need to get to him before he gets to me.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.500
I haven't seen Tecton.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.542
Ever since I tried to rip
his still-beating heart from his chest,

04:00.625 --> 04:02.083
we sort of drifted apart.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.166
Why don't you ask another hero to help?

04:06.250 --> 04:08.625
The only other hero around is Rewind,

04:08.709 --> 04:10.458
but his powers are all glitchy.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.250
He keeps reversing time by five seconds.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.583
Why don't you ask another hero?

04:15.667 --> 04:18.083
The only other hero around is Rewind,

04:18.166 --> 04:19.542
but his powers are all glitchy.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.583
He keeps reversing time by five seconds.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.125
Why don't you ask another hero?

04:24.208 --> 04:26.208
Would you get out of here, Rewind?

04:30.291 --> 04:34.375
You know, I can help you find
and destroy this Mr. Terror,

04:34.458 --> 04:37.542
but only if you can get my jail time
reduced to 25 to life.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.333
It's currently 25 to afterlife.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.959
How do I know you won't double-cross me?

04:42.041 --> 04:44.125
I couldn't if I wanted to.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.375
They make me wear a monitoring
device on my ankle.

04:46.458 --> 04:49.083
It controls my brain and prevents
me from doing anything evil.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.583
So... do we have a deal?

04:54.500 --> 04:56.875
Guess I have no choice, so it's a deal.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.625
But we have to act quickly.

04:59.834 --> 05:02.166
I guess I have no choice, so it's a deal.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.917
But we have to act quickly.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.625
Would you cut it out, Rewind?

05:06.709 --> 05:08.083
I'm in a huge rush.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.667
Okay, here's the plan.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.041
You climb into the ditch,
and dig for the Arcturion.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.208
And what are you going to do?

05:22.291 --> 05:23.583
Nothing.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.542
I thought of the plan.
Do I have to do everything?

05:29.875 --> 05:31.333
Okay, fine.

05:31.417 --> 05:33.917
I'll stay up here as the lookout.

05:34.041 --> 05:35.333
You dig?

05:38.375 --> 05:39.667
I have a better plan.

05:39.750 --> 05:42.333
You dig for the Arcturion,
and I'll be the lookout,

05:42.417 --> 05:44.625
so if a villain shows up, I can fight him.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.500
Fine. I'll dig.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.917
You want something done right,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
you gotta do it yourself.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.041
This is hard.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.333
Dirt's heavy.

05:57.417 --> 05:58.583
I'm thirsty.

06:00.083 --> 06:02.375
For goodness sake, that's not how you dig.

06:02.458 --> 06:05.291
Oh, like you could do better.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.750
I can do better. Let me show you.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.583
Fine. If you insist.

06:12.875 --> 06:16.458
Gus, what are you doing at school?
It's a Saturday.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.959
I left my locker here.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.208
You mean you left something
in your locker?

06:20.291 --> 06:23.000
No. I left my locker.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.083
There it is.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.834
I bring my entire locker
home with me every night

06:28.917 --> 06:31.166
so I don't forget
anything that's in my locker.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.417
But you forgot your entire locker.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.208
I didn't say it was a perfect system.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.834
What are you guys digging for?

06:39.625 --> 06:42.417
We're not digging for anything.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.917
We're, um... filling this hole.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.208
Yeah, yeah,
because people keep falling in it.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.375
See?

06:56.625 --> 06:57.750
Wow, you're right.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.166
That hole came out of nowhere.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.750
I'd offer to help you fill it,

07:04.834 --> 07:06.458
but that seems hard.

07:09.208 --> 07:11.083
You forgot your locker again.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.208
I really need to rethink this system.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.333
Okay, listen.

07:27.417 --> 07:29.542
I can't let anyone know
I'm sneaking you out of here,

07:29.625 --> 07:31.375
so I have the perfect disguise for you.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.166
This will never work.

07:34.959 --> 07:38.083
Trust me. No one will
even give you a second glance.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.417
Solar Flare says she's sick of everyone
always focusing on her looks.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.250
Yesterday,
Blue Tornado complimented her hair,

07:44.333 --> 07:45.709
and she melted his face off.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.959
I get the feeling you're just doing this
to humiliate me.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.709
Well, you have tried to electrocute me,
like, 11 times.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.542
Anyway, to lure out
the villains who are after you,

07:58.625 --> 08:00.333
I put a post on a villain website

08:00.417 --> 08:02.375
that Quimby Fletcher
would be signing comic books

08:02.458 --> 08:03.875
at the Domain this afternoon.

08:03.959 --> 08:06.375
You think that Mr. Terror's henchmen
will see the post?

08:06.458 --> 08:07.333
Totally.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.500
Every villain is on Murderfacespace.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.291
First he invents a popular website,

08:12.375 --> 08:14.041
then he gets kitchen duty.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.542
Murder Face has all the luck.

08:26.458 --> 08:27.500
(alarm blaring)

08:27.583 --> 08:30.500
Hey, hey, hey, there's no need for that.

08:30.583 --> 08:35.041
Uh, Replicate is just goofing around
and morphed into Solar Flare.

08:35.125 --> 08:38.625
And Replicate, you look nothing like her.

08:38.709 --> 08:41.083
Solar Flare is way more attractive.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.125
Not that I'm focusing on your looks.

08:44.208 --> 08:46.083
I wouldn't give you a second glance.

08:47.208 --> 08:50.375
Not that you're not attractive.
I mean, you are attractive, but not...

08:50.458 --> 08:52.083
Please don't melt my face off.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.333
Wow, first you dress me up like a woman,

09:05.417 --> 09:07.500
then you tell me I'm not attractive?

09:07.583 --> 09:09.291
No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.

09:16.333 --> 09:19.333
(Skylar) Hope you're not too tired up
there doing nothing.

09:21.667 --> 09:22.667
How can I be tired?

09:22.750 --> 09:24.583
I just took a 45-minute nap.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.500
-(shovel thudding)
-(Skylar) Hey.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.709
I hit something.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.959
I think it's the alien spaceship.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.333
How do you know it's the alien spaceship?

09:36.417 --> 09:38.750
Uh, I'm from space.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.000
And I'm an alien.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.291
I always forget that.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.834
This is so cool.

09:52.917 --> 09:56.667
Although I don't see how
you could travel across galaxies

09:56.750 --> 09:58.959
in this thing.
It doesn't even have any cup holders.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.291
Kaz, focus.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.375
There are cup holders
right in front of you.

10:07.417 --> 10:10.959
All right, now I just need
to find where the Arcturion is.

10:11.041 --> 10:13.667
Hey, I found a clue.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.792
Okay, we just have to decipher the symbols

10:16.875 --> 10:19.250
from this ancient alien language.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.417
That's a game of tic-tac-toe.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.709
Oh. In that case.

10:26.583 --> 10:29.709
Let's see. I win!

10:29.792 --> 10:32.125
Take that, long-dead alien opponent.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.166
Kaz, look.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.041
Must be the Arcturion.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.750
It has an infinity symbol on it,

10:42.834 --> 10:45.333
just like the ones that
Mr. Terror's bad guys had.

10:45.417 --> 10:48.750
Okay, now let's get out of here
and bring this thing back to Mighty Med.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.375
I have a better plan.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.583
We're gonna bring this
thing back to Mighty Med,

10:52.667 --> 10:54.041
but first, we get outta here.

10:54.959 --> 10:57.875
All you did was
slightly reword what I said.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.667
That's not all I did.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.625
I also took credit for your idea.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.166
(thud)

11:04.250 --> 11:05.333
What's going on?

11:05.417 --> 11:07.250
Is someone dumping dirt in the ditch?

11:15.959 --> 11:18.917
Must be Mr. Terror's henchmen.
They're covering up the escape hatch.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.041
It's too heavy to open.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.750
There's no way out?

11:21.834 --> 11:24.333
Why? Why?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.709
I'm guessing
they're trying to suffocate us,

11:26.792 --> 11:28.917
and then they'll dig up the Arcturion,
and take it.

11:29.000 --> 11:29.959
I know that.

11:30.041 --> 11:32.542
I meant of all people
to spend my last few minutes

11:32.625 --> 11:34.917
alive with, why does it have to be you?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.417
Why? Why?

11:50.125 --> 11:52.291
Bet it's not even
Mr. Terror's henchmen up there.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.834
I bet it's Mr. Terror himself.

11:53.917 --> 11:57.125
Only a sick, twisted person
could do something this evil.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.375
Hey, Kaz and Connie, I wanted to help you
fill your ditch, so I borrowed a Bobcat.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.417
It was just lying
around my neighbor's backyard

12:11.500 --> 12:13.834
next to this swimming pool-shaped hole.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.625
I'm sure no one will miss it.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.041
It's no use. We're trapped.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.625
We're gonna be buried alive.

12:26.709 --> 12:30.041
Help! Help! Get us out of here. Help!

12:32.041 --> 12:34.333
Spaceship help system activated.

12:34.417 --> 12:37.083
My language sensors have detected English.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.792
I am the holographic
caretaker of this ship.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.000
We need your help.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.917
We're being buried alive,
and we need to find a way out.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.625
If you activate the ship's thrusters,

12:45.709 --> 12:48.250
there might be just enough fuel left
to get you to the surface.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.208
Here's what you do.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.458
First, pull the lavender-colored lever.

12:52.542 --> 12:55.709
Then push the button
with the canary-colored trapezoid.

12:55.792 --> 12:58.000
Finally, push the button
with the blue-colored...

12:58.083 --> 12:59.709
(speaks alien language)

13:00.959 --> 13:02.333
Oh, no.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.667
What in the world is a trapezoid?

13:05.792 --> 13:07.417
There are only two blue buttons.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.542
-We'll just try both of them.
- Excellent plan.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.291
Except one of the blue buttons
will activate the thrusters,

13:12.375 --> 13:14.250
and the other
will make your heads explode.

13:15.583 --> 13:18.500
So you're saying
that we have a 50-50 chance

13:18.583 --> 13:20.208
of blowing ourselves up?

13:20.291 --> 13:22.250
I'm sorry,
but your help session is now over.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.166
Your reference number is Y as in you're,

13:25.250 --> 13:26.375
G as in going,

13:26.458 --> 13:27.709
to as in to,

13:27.792 --> 13:29.166
D as in die.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.417
Why has no one showed up
for the Quimby Fletcher book signing?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.667
I guess villains don't use
Murderfacespace anymore.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.125
I can't say I blame them.

13:47.208 --> 13:48.834
How many videos do we have to see

13:48.917 --> 13:50.166
of your baby's first crime?

13:51.291 --> 13:55.083
Now what? I can't keep living under
the constant threat of being destroyed.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.208
I wish Quimby Fletcher didn't even exist.

13:57.291 --> 13:59.667
Then I guess I'm the tooth fairy.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.291
'Cause I'm about to grant your wish.

14:01.375 --> 14:04.542
Actually,
tooth fairy doesn't grant wishes.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.083
Right.

14:06.959 --> 14:09.625
Then how about I knock your teeth out
and give you money for 'em?

14:09.709 --> 14:11.125
Am I more like the tooth fairy now?

14:13.125 --> 14:14.208
A little.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.208
So, I guess you saw my post online.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.959
Yeah. I'm on that website all day.

14:21.041 --> 14:23.375
It's got all the latest gossip.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.458
It says here there's some fella
called Megahertz

14:25.542 --> 14:26.834
that dresses like a girl.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.542
You shut your mouth.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.166
Let's get this over with, Quimby Fletcher.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.125
I got a funeral to go to later.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.875
Yours.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.458
Megahertz, incoming.

15:29.709 --> 15:30.667
Megahertz, thank you.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.458
You saved my life.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.083
Being a good guy's fun.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.875
You still get to destroy people,
but instead of getting in trouble,

15:36.959 --> 15:38.208
you get fro-yo.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.250
By the way,

15:40.333 --> 15:41.917
you're buying me fro-yo.

15:42.583 --> 15:45.375
We need to get to the school and make sure
Kaz and Skylar are okay.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.250
Wait. His phone.

15:47.917 --> 15:50.500
Maybe I can use this to find
information about Mr. Terror.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.625
Dang it.

15:52.709 --> 15:53.959
The phone is password locked.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.417
Wow, look at his lock screen.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.959
His girlfriend's pretty.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.166
Oh, wait, that's a hostage.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.709
I'm not wrong, you're wrong.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.208
We should push this button
because it looks like a key,

16:10.291 --> 16:11.834
and a key starts an engine.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.417
And I think we should push this button

16:14.500 --> 16:16.208
because it's closer.

16:17.709 --> 16:21.125
Fine. I don't even care anymore.
Push whatever button you want.

16:35.458 --> 16:38.375
(engine starts)

16:58.834 --> 17:01.875
I did it. I did it.

17:01.959 --> 17:04.542
You did it? I'm the one
who pushed the right button.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.709
Yeah, but I tricked you into it.

17:07.792 --> 17:11.041
I knew that if I said
I wanted to push the first button,

17:11.125 --> 17:13.125
you would want to push the second button.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.041
But I was trying to trick you.

17:15.125 --> 17:18.000
See, I only said that I wanted
to push the second button

17:18.083 --> 17:20.083
because I really wanted
to push the first button.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.291
Then why did you push the second button?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.333
'Cause I got confused.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.458
What's that for?

17:31.542 --> 17:34.083
There's a villain up there
trying to bury us alive.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.959
This has gotta be some kind of weapon.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.875
Why didn't you just grab the sword?

17:37.959 --> 17:40.166
Because this one was closer.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.875
Oliver, look out!

17:49.125 --> 17:50.959
Ow! Why did you do that?

17:51.041 --> 17:53.667
You were trying to bury us alive,
and now you've captured Oliver.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.375
Skylar, we just got here.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.583
Megahertz and I were at the Domain.
He saved my life.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.000
(Megahertz) Yeah.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.083
I've seen the error of my ways.

18:01.166 --> 18:04.291
And I wanna follow the path of virtue
and righteousness.

18:08.291 --> 18:11.000
Oh, forget everything I said
in the last ten seconds.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.875
This is mine!

18:12.959 --> 18:14.792
Wait. What are you doing?

18:14.875 --> 18:16.166
I don't know.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.917
I have no idea what this thing is,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.959
but for some reason, I have to have it.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.500
I thought you said you were wearing

18:21.583 --> 18:23.500
a device that kept you
from doing anything evil.

18:23.583 --> 18:26.750
Yeah. I guess the super villainous
guy lied to you.

18:26.834 --> 18:28.083
What are the odds?

18:28.166 --> 18:29.625
Stop right there.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.333
Give me back the Arcturion.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.667
Or what?

18:32.750 --> 18:33.917
Or this.

18:37.834 --> 18:40.625
I have to admit, that is making
my face uncomfortably warm.

18:56.458 --> 18:57.750
Thank you very much.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.291
(engine sound approaching)

19:02.375 --> 19:03.834
What's that noise?

19:03.917 --> 19:06.625
Uh, it must be the power of the Arcturion.

19:20.375 --> 19:21.792
I'm back.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.917
I ran out of dirt,
so I called Dirk Fry the Dirt Guy,

19:25.000 --> 19:28.250
but he was all out of dirt,
so I called my backup dirt guy,

19:28.333 --> 19:29.750
Clark Kirk the Dirt Clerk.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.792
Wait. You were the one
who was filling the ditch with dirt?

19:35.458 --> 19:37.542
That's an odd way of saying thank you.

19:37.625 --> 19:40.166
So is this. Thra-lank you.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.125
Please, don't send me back to jail.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.208
I have to share a cell with Flesh Mangler.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.500
His stories are so boring.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.333
Spoiler alert:
they all involve flesh mangling.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.709
Take him to Mighty Max.

19:58.792 --> 20:01.709
And make sure he doesn't get any fro-yo.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.792
I can't believe you guys
found the Arcturion.

20:06.875 --> 20:10.000
I was sure you'd be fighting
over which switch to flip,

20:10.083 --> 20:12.834
and Skylar would try
to use reverse psychology,

20:12.917 --> 20:14.417
and then Kaz would get all confused.

20:15.166 --> 20:16.667
(laughs)

20:16.750 --> 20:18.250
What?

20:18.333 --> 20:20.458
How could you even think that, Oliver?

20:20.542 --> 20:21.917
That's not at all what happened.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.583
Yeah, it was a button, not a switch.

20:26.542 --> 20:29.875
All right, well, until we figure out
what to do with the Arcturion,

20:29.959 --> 20:31.583
we need to hide it somewhere safe.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.125
Not in your pants.

20:35.041 --> 20:36.583
Not in my pants.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.875
Gus, why are you here again?

20:52.959 --> 20:54.417
I forgot my backpack.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.375
Also, I'm looking for my bobcat.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.208
It's right there.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.625
No, my other bobcat.

21:02.709 --> 21:04.083
(bobcat screeching)

21:04.166 --> 21:05.500
Oh, there she is.

21:08.291 --> 21:09.375
I better go.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.500
If I don't feed her on time,
she wets the floor.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.000
With people's innards.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.583
(theme music plays)

21:42.000 --> 21:43.291
(boing)

21:46.959 --> 21:48.000
(boy) Yes!
