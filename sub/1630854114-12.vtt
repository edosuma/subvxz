WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:07.841
You're here early.

00:07.941 --> 00:08.942
I could not sleep.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.444
Me either.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.046
Delivery day!

00:14.282 --> 00:16.717
Before long,
this room will be filled

00:16.817 --> 00:21.455
with the satisfying hum of sock
ovens and knitting machines.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.890
Do they hum?

00:22.990 --> 00:25.859
It's more of a...

00:25.959 --> 00:27.861
Still satisfying.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.029
Damn right.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.998
It's delivery day!

00:31.099 --> 00:32.800
Who's excited?

00:32.900 --> 00:34.268
I was.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.603
What are you doing here?

00:35.703 --> 00:38.172
She is our
angel investor.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.807
What?

00:39.907 --> 00:43.844
Oh, you're putting
the knitting machines here.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.479
Interesting.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.880
We thought so.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.216
That means she hates it.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.118
When I grew this mustache,
she said, "Interesting."

00:50.218 --> 00:54.222
When she met Abishola,
she said, "Very interesting."

00:54.322 --> 00:56.824
Are you sure you don't want to
use this area for finishing?

00:56.924 --> 00:58.892
I am sure.
Thank you for checking.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.728
No, you want to be able
to look out your office

01:00.828 --> 01:02.296
and see the
final product.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.632
That is a good point.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.066
What?

01:06.167 --> 01:08.102
Finishing is
in the other room.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.704
But should it be?

01:10.804 --> 01:13.807
It's my factory,
and it's my call.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.576
Interesting.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.712
Ah, I hear it now.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.612
Hello, sisters.

01:51.712 --> 01:52.913
What a blessed day

01:53.013 --> 01:56.016
God has provided.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.519
Is she talking to us?

02:00.053 --> 02:03.157
I would like to introduce you
to my successful lawyer son,

02:03.257 --> 02:05.125
Funmbi.
<i>E kaasan,</i> Aunties.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.695
<i>E kaasan.</i>
Hello there.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.498
He's come all the way to
Detroit to visit his mother.

02:10.598 --> 02:14.368
No, I am here to settle
a class action lawsuit.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.637
Well, I hope you
stick it to the man.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.906
Actually, I will be sticking it
to the people

02:19.006 --> 02:22.976
who believe petroleum products
contributed to their hair loss.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.012
Oh, you work
for that side.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.114
The winning side.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.218
Funmbi, you are
so grown-up now.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.885
I remember
when you were this high.

02:31.985 --> 02:37.225
I finally hit my growth spurt
my first year at Harvard.

02:38.025 --> 02:41.061
Harvard Law.
He's a successful lawyer.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.730
Yeah, you mentioned that.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.099
I worked very hard to fulfill
my father's dream for me.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.601
Oh, it was mine, too.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.472
God answered my prayers,
giving me a son who could

02:51.572 --> 02:55.609
come to the aid of all these
helpless megacorporations.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.379
You should join us
for lunch.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.315
They try to get me
to eat with them every day.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.484
But they know
I use my lunch hour

03:03.584 --> 03:07.755
to read the Bible
to coma patients.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.657
Oh.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.325
Of course.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.926
How could I
have forgotten?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.963
Yes, they tell us all the
time how much they love it.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.266
When they wake up. Yeah.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.001
Come, Funmbi. I want to
introduce you to some doctors.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.470
Goodbye.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.772
Well, have a blessed day, sister.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.107
Peace be unto you.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.642
What the hell was that?

03:28.742 --> 03:30.578
I have no idea.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.881
It's not too cold
for you, is it?

03:33.981 --> 03:37.050
Ah, this gives me a good excuse
to snuggle with you in public.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.321
We've been so busy.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.189
I've missed this.
Me, too.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.657
The closest we've
gotten to a hug lately

03:43.757 --> 03:46.394
was when my watch got
caught in your sweater.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.296
I told Gloria
I was going to take ten minutes,

03:48.396 --> 03:49.563
but we can take 15.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.966
You're breaking
the rules for me?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.201
Shh.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.339
I'm in no rush to get
back to the factory.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.909
What about delivery day?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.277
You were so excited.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.713
That's before Dottie
got her groove back.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.115
What?
Mom showed up this morning

04:08.215 --> 04:09.950
telling me how to do my job.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.152
You should be proud of her.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.622
When we first started
physical therapy,

04:14.722 --> 04:15.989
she was scared.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.091
She did not think
she'll ever be herself again.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.960
You never let her give up.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.028
No, I did not.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.730
You pushed her every day.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.064
Yes, I did.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.099
So this is all your fault.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.439
Not only would we be
providing the children

04:31.539 --> 04:32.706
with soccer uniforms,

04:32.806 --> 04:36.276
but the jerseys would be
free advertising.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.346
Is the team good?
What is their record?

04:38.446 --> 04:40.314
They're kindergarteners.
They don't really keep score.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.384
Find out.
MaxDot only backs winners.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.253
Mr. Wheeler.
Hey, guys.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.255
I'm surprised to see you.
It is delivery day.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.357
Well, I was worried
about you guys

04:49.457 --> 04:50.958
since you're
so shorthanded.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.726
We are?
Who's out today?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.528
We had
a very productive morning.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.597
Well, I don't know
how well you could do

04:56.697 --> 04:58.732
without the old engine
that keeps this place running.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.134
Seriously, who are
you talking about?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.803
Mom. I'm talking about Mom.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.237
I meant to thank you

05:04.338 --> 05:06.374
for taking her off our hands.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.175
You're welcome.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.411
And thank you
for taking her back.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.781
Oh, no.
Uh, we have had her for so long.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.650
I would not want to be
a Dottie hog.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.821
The CEO of MaxDot is telling you
you're taking her.

05:20.921 --> 05:24.425
And the president is saying
no, thank you.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.428
There is far more work
to be done at the factory.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.363
Please. She lives in my house,

05:29.463 --> 05:31.031
works at my company.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.802
I started an entire new division
to get a break from the woman.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.504
I'm begging you.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.581
Feels like this is
probably about you.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.620
My successful lawyer son

05:52.720 --> 05:55.389
has not lost a case
in five years.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.824
Six years, Mummy.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.792
Please boast accurately.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.496
I should hire you for
our next workman's comp claim.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.098
No disrespect, but we work
with large corporations,

06:05.198 --> 06:07.100
not mom-and-pop shops.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.902
Oh, no, he was
making a joke.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.704
I'm not really a joke person.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.740
You hide it well.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.341
Shall we go inside?

06:14.442 --> 06:15.543
Oh, go ahead.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.244
Uh, we are going to stay
a bit longer

06:17.344 --> 06:18.646
so that everyone
can see my

06:18.746 --> 06:21.915
successful lawyer son.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.216
I don't know
if you caught it,

06:23.316 --> 06:26.053
but Kemi's son
might be a successful lawyer.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.723
If it were Dele, I would bring
it up even more than she does.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.825
Hello, my dear.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.226
Mr. Mborata.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.395
Mr. Mborata?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.297
I do not think
it would be appropriate for me

06:37.397 --> 06:39.066
to embrace my pharmacist.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.634
What is going on, Kemi?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.270
She is your elder.
Show some respect.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.572
I am more than
just a pharmacist.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.840
Yes, he's also
my real estate agent.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.843
Come, my son. We should not
be late for service.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.178
Your son?

06:51.278 --> 06:54.347
I will collect
my reflux pills on Tuesday.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.651
But, Kemi...
Goodbye, casual acquaintance!

07:03.056 --> 07:04.825
Good morning, family.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.926
Morning.
Morning, Bob.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.227
Do you want breakfast?

07:07.327 --> 07:08.496
Uh, no, thanks, buddy.
I got to run.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.198
Dele, tell him.
Tell me what?

07:11.298 --> 07:13.467
I heard the state is offering
grants for businesses

07:13.567 --> 07:15.268
who install solar panels
on their roofs.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.305
That's a good idea.
I'll think about it.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.908
If it is a good idea,
just do it.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.511
I said I'd think about it.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.148
Hello.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.216
I had a thought.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.886
You should reach out
to other companies that are

07:32.986 --> 07:35.355
importing socks and tell them
we can supply at a better rate.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.024
We're not there yet, Mom.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.527
Well, if you set it up now,
you'll be ready to go day one.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.328
I'll think about it.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.997
What is there to think abou...
Bobby?

07:44.097 --> 07:45.999
What are you guys doing here?

07:46.099 --> 07:47.100
Oh, we're just

07:47.200 --> 07:48.869
chitchatting about our factory.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.439
You know, I think you should
make a climate pledge

07:52.540 --> 07:55.042
that MaxDot Manufacturing
will be carbon neutral.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.376
I'll think about it.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.911
You should also consider
adding a third shift.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.914
That way, we can
churn out our socks 24/7.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.250
I'll think about it!

08:03.350 --> 08:06.820
You know, your mother made a
great point about the factory.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.421
It might be better
for workflow...

08:08.522 --> 08:11.324
I'll think about it!

08:24.738 --> 08:26.339
Unwrapping day.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.141
Yay, unwrapping day.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.645
I have been saving these
for a special occasion.

08:31.745 --> 08:37.317
A couple of Cubans to welcome
our new friends from China.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.986
Thanks. Maybe later.
Let's just do this.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.521
Has anyone seen
my friend Bob?

08:41.622 --> 08:45.258
He's normally filled with
a contagious whimsy.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.427
I'm sorry.
I'm here, I'm here.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.130
I will take photos
for the 'gram.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.399
That's what the kids say.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.767
Everybody's got
an opinion.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.836
But when there's
some real work to be done,

08:55.936 --> 08:57.437
where the hell are they?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.707
Okay.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.975
None of these are usable.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.611
I know what you need.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.812
A new family?

09:04.912 --> 09:06.379
Of sorts.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.583
Tonight I am taking you
to my Christian men's group.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.051
Uh, no, thanks.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.320
Uh, when you are lost,
sometimes you need your brothers

09:13.420 --> 09:15.188
to help you find the path.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.456
I said no, Tunde.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.925
I really think it could help.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.794
I think I'd rather stick
my head in this sock oven,

09:20.894 --> 09:22.195
so just freakin' drop it!

09:22.295 --> 09:25.432
Do you feel better
yelling at your friend?

09:25.532 --> 09:26.667
No.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.501
And do you want
to go home tonight?

09:28.602 --> 09:30.103
No.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.439
So where do we need to go?

09:32.539 --> 09:35.408
The Christian men's group.

09:42.616 --> 09:46.386
Tonight I am
making you a feast.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.422
Of course I know
you are vegan.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.693
Which is why, as we
speak, I am brining

09:52.793 --> 09:56.163
a soy-based goat head.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.031
Mummy loves you.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.705
Soy-based goat head?

10:04.805 --> 10:07.474
I used olives
for the eyes.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.376
Only the best
for my boy.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.112
Are you always
this strange around him?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.114
What?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.149
More kind? Loving?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.218
Devoted to someone
other than myself?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.620
Yes.
It is nothing like you.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.424
You should let Funmbi
see the real Kemi.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.163
What would you do if Dele
stopped answering your calls?

10:30.263 --> 10:33.000
Cancel his cell service.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.202
Or kept your grandchildren
across the country

10:35.302 --> 10:37.370
without even
sending pictures?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.972
How would Dele do that?

10:39.072 --> 10:42.676
Bob and I will be living with
him and his family until we die.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.178
Okay, I'm done
discussing this.

10:46.013 --> 10:49.249
You will never be truly close
to Funmbi if you keep on

10:49.349 --> 10:52.686
pretending to be Kemi
the Bible-thumping missionary.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.821
Enough.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.622
This is none of
your business.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.527
It is my business.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.896
It is none of
your business.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.699
It is.
No!

11:17.945 --> 11:18.879
Bob!

11:18.979 --> 11:20.547
I am so glad you could come.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.983
I, uh... I brought a Bible.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.852
That is adorable.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.720
Bob brought a Bible!

11:28.421 --> 11:30.657
This is Christian
men's group,

11:30.758 --> 11:32.659
not Bible study. Right.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.062
Those don't sound
like each other at all.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.730
Care for a beer, Bob?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.231
Hey, Pastor.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.867
You sure that's all right
with the Big Guy?

11:39.967 --> 11:42.135
Proverbs 27:17 says,

11:42.235 --> 11:43.703
"As iron sharpens iron,

11:43.804 --> 11:46.373
so one person
sharpens another."

11:46.473 --> 11:47.407
So no praying?

11:47.507 --> 11:50.210
If we are losing at halftime.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.213
You sold this all wrong.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.816
Next time,
lead with beer and sports.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.651
I am just happy to
see you smile again.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.153
Uh, Wole!

12:00.253 --> 12:03.090
Unless you're going to
sand off the water marks,

12:03.190 --> 12:04.925
use a coaster!

12:07.227 --> 12:08.929
Hey, buddy.

12:09.029 --> 12:13.266
Do you ever feel like
your heart is an open wound?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.003
Do you need this?

12:16.103 --> 12:19.306
The love of my life walked by me
like I was a common houseplant.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.608
You need this.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.877
I should have been a lawyer.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.513
Maybe then Kemi
would introduce me to her son.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.681
You're way too likable
to be a lawyer.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.819
Funmbi, on the other
hand, born for it.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.321
I'm proud to be with Kemi.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.857
I wish she felt
the same way about me.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.392
Well, you can't let
people walk all over you.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.861
You got to fight
for what you want.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.530
I have always been a lover,
not a fighter.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.699
And now I have lost my lover.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.435
I know how you feel.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.702
I've been miserable, too.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.072
Yeah, today was
my unwrapping day.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.342
Oh. Is that like a bar mitzvah?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.477
Kinda. But bigger.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.212
My mom ruined it.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.348
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.951
You know what?

13:04.751 --> 13:07.620
You and I are gonna stop being
victims and take the power back.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.389
If you promise
not to give up,

13:09.489 --> 13:10.958
neither will I.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.361
I still do not really
understand your situation,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.529
but I'm inspired by your tone.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.331
You're a good friend, Bob.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.666
Ah, you, too, buddy.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.768
Mazel tov.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.736
All right.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.710
The soup's good. Mmm.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.213
You cannot even tell
it's fake goat.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.548
My vegan son took one bite

13:35.648 --> 13:37.650
and accused me
of using chicken stock.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.419
It does kind of taste like that.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.687
Because it is!

13:40.787 --> 13:43.023
Who makes a soup
without chicken stock?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.524
Hello.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.093
Chukwuemeka.
Hello.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.194
Hi, cutie.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.129
Kemi, can we speak privately?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.697
Of course.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.172
You look
especially sculpted today.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.908
Do not flatter me.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.576
But thank you. I bought
a new pull-up bar.

14:09.917 --> 14:13.153
So, what's new?

14:14.121 --> 14:16.823
I want you to introduce
me to your son.

14:16.924 --> 14:17.891
As your man.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.293
That won't be necessary.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.594
Funmbi will be gone soon.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.164
We only have to live
a lie till Tuesday.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.799
You are not hearing me.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.436
If you will not tell
him we are together,

14:29.536 --> 14:31.438
then we will
not be together.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.474
Chukwuemeka, wait.

14:39.913 --> 14:43.183
This is the first time
my son's come home in 15 years.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.385
That is very disrespectful.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.855
I live with my mother, and
I still call her twice a day.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.458
What?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.426
Separate issue.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.697
Funmbi was
always his father's son.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.067
And when he died,

15:00.167 --> 15:02.402
I could never measure up.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.672
That's not fair.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.707
Four years
after my husband's death,

15:07.807 --> 15:10.443
I went to tea with a man

15:10.543 --> 15:13.080
and Funmbi
stopped speaking to me.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.348
I'm sorry.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.017
I did not know.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.953
I have never told anybody.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.690
Why are you looking
at me like that?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.825
Because I am angry with you.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.595
But I also want to hug you.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.064
Well, then hug me,
you beautiful idiot!

15:36.403 --> 15:37.304
<i>This is</i>

15:37.404 --> 15:38.371
our final stop.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.973
Quality control and finishing.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.875
After this, the sock goes
to our distributor.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.077
And who's our distributor?

15:44.177 --> 15:45.345
MaxDot.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.546
I was testing you.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.880
Well done.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.849
What do you expect
your daily output to be?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.252
Any run-of-the-mill factory
would be happy with 10,000.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.055
But I'm a crazy son of a bitch,
so we're gonna do 12,000.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.056
That's great.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.557
He's nuts.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.359
What do you think?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.627
This is wonderful.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.630
I had such low expectations.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.965
Thanks, honey.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.136
Just one little thing.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.904
Uh, are you married to this
color for the walls? I just--

16:12.005 --> 16:14.174
I don't think it's
gonna inspire the workforce.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.077
They'll be inspired by their
paychecks and health insurance.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.078
They're getting benefits?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.479
That'll cut into our profits.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.049
Healthy workers make
more socks than sick ones.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.017
The guy's good.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.418
All right,

16:25.518 --> 16:28.288
this concludes our first annual
shareholders' meeting.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.393
Yeah. Now everybody
get the hell out.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.727
Excuse me?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.429
This factory is my baby.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.864
I'm gonna feed it,
nurture it,

16:37.964 --> 16:40.233
and keep my family
from screwing it up. Well,

16:40.333 --> 16:43.603
it's my money, so I'll screw up
whatever I damn well please.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.105
Uh, no, you won't.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.573
Excuse me?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.408
If this arrangement
doesn't work for you,

16:48.508 --> 16:49.742
you're free to back out.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.779
I'm gonna make this happen
with or without you.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.516
Damn it, I'm
in, Bobby.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.118
Me, too.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.620
You're nuts,
but we believe in you.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.654
Appreciate it.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.356
Your father would be proud.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.891
Thanks, Mom.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.361
Do I need to say it again?

17:08.461 --> 17:09.662
Everybody out!

17:09.762 --> 17:12.199
My husband is
building an empire.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.740
I have a bit
of legal experience as well.

17:20.840 --> 17:21.841
I once

17:21.941 --> 17:23.210
represented myself

17:23.310 --> 17:24.844
in traffic court.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.215
The ticket was dismissed because
the officer did not appear.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.916
Why would you say that?

17:30.016 --> 17:32.519
The headline is, I won.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.257
I have somebody
I'd like you to meet.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.360
We met. He is your
pharmacist/Realtor.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.729
He is much more
than that.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.198
Chukwuemeka...
is my man.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.666
I want you to know I have

17:46.766 --> 17:48.701
the best intentions
with your mother.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.471
Ah-ah. This is your boy toy?

17:51.571 --> 17:52.639
He is not a boy.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.974
He's a full
three years older than you.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.345
I love this man,
and I will no longer hide it.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.513
You are making a fool
of yourself

18:00.613 --> 18:03.082
and sullying the
memory of my father.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.717
Listen to me, Funmbi.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.286
I want you in my life,

18:06.386 --> 18:09.055
but I will not allow you
to dictate how I live it.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.159
I am too vibrant to dry
like a raisin in the sun.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.826
There's my Kemi.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.528
Also...

18:16.796 --> 18:19.132
...your mother is fun.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.169
Now, you may come
into church with us

18:22.269 --> 18:23.603
or you may leave.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.874
That was very sexy.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.209
I know.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.043
What are you doing?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.145
Get in the church.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.080
Use that brain, Harvard.
