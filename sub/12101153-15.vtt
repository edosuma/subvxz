WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.351
[Supergirl]
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.394 --> 00:06.789
We're in a race against
a vengeful 5th
Dimensional Imp named Nyxly

00:06.832 --> 00:11.098
to find seven Totems before
she can use them
to wipe us out of existence.

00:11.141 --> 00:13.274
How am I going to hunt down
the other Totems

00:13.317 --> 00:14.927
if I don't stop feeling?

00:14.971 --> 00:17.887
I'm giving everyone
their humanity back.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.845
[Supergirl] We have two Totems.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.630
[Mitch] The next
Totem's at The Hague.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.371
We're going to the Netherlands.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.286
It's only a matter of time
till you get
a new foster family.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.636
One that can help you
understand your powers.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.725
I'm never going
to have a real home.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.602
[Supergirl whooshes in]

00:37.646 --> 00:39.169
Esme's not here yet, right?

00:39.213 --> 00:40.127
I didn't miss it?

00:40.170 --> 00:41.954
-No, no, you're safe.
-Okay.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.174
No, Kelly's still on her way.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.046
Did you really have to bring
the whole store?

00:46.089 --> 00:47.569
I mean, she's
just one little girl.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.658
One really little girl.
God, she's so cute.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.442
I had to make
a good impression.

00:51.486 --> 00:55.272
And don't judge me.
You guys are
painting an entire wall.

00:55.316 --> 00:59.102
Excuse me,
that mural represents
hope and dreams,

00:59.146 --> 01:02.149
with a guardian protector
to keep all who enter safe.

01:02.192 --> 01:05.543
My father painted something
similar in my
daughter's room back on Mars.

01:05.587 --> 01:09.025
I thought it was important
to continue
the family tradition.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.809
So do I.

01:10.853 --> 01:14.117
I stopped by Eliza's and this
is every stuffed
animal and blanket

01:14.161 --> 01:18.034
she ever got me to make me feel
more comfortable
when I first landed.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.166
Look!

01:19.209 --> 01:20.863
You're going to make
a great Aunt Kara.

01:20.906 --> 01:24.040
Thank you, Grandpa J'onn.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.174
And, Mama Alex, I can't believe
this is actually happening.

01:27.217 --> 01:30.177
[exhaling] I know. I mean,
I'm just...
It's like I can't breathe.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.004
[voice shaking]
You know, I'm so excited,

01:32.048 --> 01:34.006
and then I'm just terrified,
you know.

01:34.050 --> 01:37.097
I just can't
believe it happened
so quickly with Esme.

01:37.140 --> 01:41.101
It's emergency hearing,
and then it's
provisional custody,

01:41.144 --> 01:45.583
and six months fostering
and she's ours, permanently.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.324
-[door opens]
-[Kelly] We're here.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.370
-Gosh, I can't...
-You got this.

01:49.413 --> 01:54.636
[door closes] Here it is,
this is your room. Go, look.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.075
This is really my room?

01:59.119 --> 02:02.905
Yes, and we hope
that you like it.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.212
But, you know, if you don't,
we can...

02:05.255 --> 02:07.518
We can change anything,
or we can change everything.

02:07.562 --> 02:10.173
If there's a game that you
don't like,
we'll just ditch it.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.219
You don't like the bedspread?
Totally fine.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.264
-The desk and...
-Alex.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.919
-...the rocket ship,
if there's--
-Alex, I think she's got it.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.399
-[J'onn J'onzz laughs]
-Of course she does.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.532
Um, Esme...

02:21.576 --> 02:25.319
this right here is
my sister Kara.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.973
Hi, Esme. It's very
nice to meet you.

02:28.017 --> 02:31.194
You know, I was adopted too,
by Alex's mom and dad.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.240
And look, I actually
brought you
the things they got me...

02:33.283 --> 02:35.024
[Kelly gasping]

02:35.067 --> 02:36.417
...to make me feel more at home
when they took me in.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.245
Do you like stuffed animals?

02:42.074 --> 02:44.773
I already have one.
Her name is Lovey.

02:44.816 --> 02:47.254
Our home is Lovey's home too.

02:47.297 --> 02:48.820
Very cute.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.127
And this is J'onn.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.564
He's been like a dad to Alex
since forever.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.305
Hi.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.002
-It's very nice
to meet you, J'onn.
-[J'onn J'onzz chuckling]

02:57.046 --> 03:00.136
It's wonderful to
meet you too, Esme.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.095
Would you like me to help you
find a spot for your Lovey?

03:03.139 --> 03:05.924
I think I can find
a place for her myself.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.193
[Esme screams]

03:16.413 --> 03:17.893
Sweetie, are you okay?

03:17.936 --> 03:21.288
Hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.
It's just your powers.

03:21.331 --> 03:25.553
Listen, so you can mimic
other alien's powers

03:25.596 --> 03:28.033
and sometimes
without even knowing it.

03:28.077 --> 03:30.819
This time
you mimicked J'onn's powers,

03:30.862 --> 03:32.342
and he's a Martian.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.345
And I'm so sorry that
I didn't tell you
he was an alien.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.173
I'm so sorry, Esme.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.655
Esme, what you just did
is called phasing.

03:42.483 --> 03:45.877
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
I promise.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.749
Oh, sweetie,
you're not in trouble.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.664
You're not in trouble,
it's okay.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.362
It's okay.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.843
"The Truth Behind Chaos."

03:56.061 --> 03:59.108
Huh. What
a curious world this is,

03:59.151 --> 04:02.633
that this journalist,
William Dey,

04:02.677 --> 04:05.767
would spin a narrative
that Supergirl
and her colleagues

04:05.810 --> 04:07.682
are trying to protect people...

04:08.596 --> 04:09.945
from me.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.904
If they would just
leave me alone,

04:12.948 --> 04:15.516
I'd be free to collect
all the Totems
and I'd get out of their hair.

04:15.559 --> 04:18.214
[Mitch tinkering]

04:18.258 --> 04:24.612
But that's what
people in power,
like Supergirl, do.

04:24.655 --> 04:28.311
They tell tales to
make themselves
look like the hero.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.272
That's what my father did.

04:32.315 --> 04:36.058
[Mitch tinkering]

04:38.495 --> 04:40.410
-Mitch.
-Sorry.

04:40.454 --> 04:43.065
I didn't mean to be rude.
I was just trying to help.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.896
Naxim stole it from an Almeraci
he once imprisoned.

04:47.939 --> 04:51.856
It's designed to absorb
and repel energy.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.381
I refashioned it
to hold the Courage Totem.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.947
[cuff clicks]

04:55.991 --> 04:58.646
And affixed to the cuff
Mxyzptlk put on you.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.431
To what end?

05:01.475 --> 05:05.087
I hate seeing
your powers diminished
by these superheroes.

05:05.130 --> 05:09.047
And I thought with this,
maybe it'll give you
some of your magic back

05:09.091 --> 05:11.354
and allow you to use
the one Totem you have

05:11.398 --> 05:13.617
the way it was
meant to be used,

05:13.661 --> 05:17.926
to get the rest of the Totems,
starting with the Hope Totem.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.064
It works.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.113
You just gave me Courage.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.463
So now I think I should go
and take Hope.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.389
That was awful.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.436
Oh, my God.
She was so
embarrassed and so scared.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.612
I mean, she's just
coming into her powers

05:51.655 --> 05:53.831
and doesn't know how they work.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.529
Must be so overwhelming.

05:55.572 --> 05:58.619
I just... All I want to do
is just protect her.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.578
You know what, I feel like
I'm completely
out of my depth here.

06:01.622 --> 06:05.800
I don't want to say the
wrong thing. I don't want
to make her feel worse.

06:05.843 --> 06:09.804
Yeah, I'm on pins
and needles, too. [sighing]

06:09.847 --> 06:13.982
But being able
to have a family with you

06:14.678 --> 06:16.506
is such a blessing.

06:16.550 --> 06:20.728
And being able to bring
that little girl
into our family...

06:20.771 --> 06:24.166
I just want to give
her everything
that she's missed in her life.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.559
Yeah.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.517
And I think
that she's especially lucky

06:27.561 --> 06:30.172
that we are the ones
who are adopting her.

06:30.215 --> 06:33.436
And you can help her
figure out her powers

06:33.480 --> 06:35.917
and help her feel comfortable
experiencing them.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.921
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

06:39.964 --> 06:42.358
You can do that.
[chuckles softly]

06:43.359 --> 06:45.187
[scribbling]

06:52.542 --> 06:54.283
Do I smell chocolate
chip cookies?

06:54.326 --> 06:56.546
Actually, chocolate roulade,
Jaffa cakes

06:56.590 --> 06:59.331
and hobnobs,
my Aunt Millicent's specialty.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.683
And they're not for you.
They're for Alex
to give to Esme.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.685
Yes, the young liege.

07:04.728 --> 07:07.209
Tell me, do either of you have
any sense what her preference

07:07.252 --> 07:09.385
for building block
sets might be?

07:09.429 --> 07:12.867
Castle, theme park or train?

07:12.910 --> 07:15.130
-Train.
-Train. Sorry. Super hearing.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.479
Was the answer
really that obvious?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.438
The castle and the theme park
are great, Brainy,

07:18.481 --> 07:20.048
but once she builds the train,
she can take it

07:20.091 --> 07:21.266
on whatever adventure
she wants.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.703
The words right
out of my mouth.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.487
Any luck finding Nyxly
or the next Totem?

07:24.531 --> 07:26.663
Still scanning.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.623
Nia hasn't had
any luck in Parthas
finding the Dream Totem either.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.276
[alert beeping]

07:31.320 --> 07:33.670
-[Lena] Looks like
you just got lucky.
-[Brainy] Indeed.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.543
It appears that three days ago,
Nyxly broke into The Hague

07:36.586 --> 07:39.546
while we were dealing
with the chaos
caused by the Humanity Totem.

07:39.589 --> 07:42.418
Although, she barely entered
and walked away with nothing.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.202
Why are you only
getting the match now?

07:44.246 --> 07:47.815
The system scans
every available
public camera worldwide.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.513
That's billions
of bits of data,
and unfortunately,

07:50.557 --> 07:53.255
I am beholden
to 21st century upload speeds.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.822
I'm accessing The Hague's
security system now

07:54.865 --> 07:56.388
for more information.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.042
Still, it's surprising
there was no news report.

07:58.086 --> 08:01.176
With things escalating
between Kaznia
and Corto Maltese,

08:01.219 --> 08:02.960
and the setting up
of the peace talks,

08:03.004 --> 08:06.137
a non-robbery at The Hague was
probably the least
newsworthy item.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.965
A Totem must be there.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.925
According to their
security feed,
Nyxly just returned.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.325
[people screaming]

08:20.369 --> 08:21.762
[whispering] Cgyrzyx.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.894
Remove this energy field
and stand down

08:23.938 --> 08:25.722
or these soldiers will fire.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.463
You know, I hate to be rude,

08:27.507 --> 08:30.379
but I just don't like things
being pointed at me.

08:31.685 --> 08:32.729
[soldiers yelling]

08:35.602 --> 08:39.431
Look at that,
frozen in fear. [scoffs]

08:39.475 --> 08:41.695
Seems I'm a match
for you once again.

08:41.738 --> 08:45.133
And with the Totem's power
I can give courage and...

08:45.916 --> 08:47.570
I can take it away.

08:47.614 --> 08:48.963
[gasps]

08:50.660 --> 08:52.575
I guess that depends
who you hit it with.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.535
Keep her distracted.
I'm going over the force field.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.240
[sighs in exasperation]

09:11.768 --> 09:12.769
Hi.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.466
Isn't this a lovely surprise?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.512
Wow. Look at all the gifts.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.646
Esme, these are my co-workers.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.038
This is Lena.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.780
This is William
and this is Brainy.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.826
Everyone, meet Esme.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.829
Hello, Esme.
It's very good to meet you.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.221
You're very pretty.

09:30.265 --> 09:34.443
[laughing] Thank you.
So are you.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.837
Hey, I was wondering, Brainy,

09:36.880 --> 09:39.230
if you could spare
a little bit of time
to help me out.

09:39.274 --> 09:42.756
Um, Esme is a Dyralian,
and Kelly and I are looking

09:42.799 --> 09:46.934
to get her to feel a little
more comfortable
with her mimic powers.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.718
-Off the record.
-Of course.

09:48.762 --> 09:53.157
Lucky for you, I used to be
old friends with a Dyralian.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.290
This one time,
the Dyralian and I

09:55.333 --> 09:57.118
were socializing
with a Winathian
friend of ours,

09:57.161 --> 10:01.035
and the Dyralian unknowingly
taps into the
Winathian's ability

10:01.078 --> 10:04.473
to de-power the
gravity in the room.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.649
It took us three hours
to get down from the ceiling.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.782
[chuckling] He's funny.

10:08.825 --> 10:13.700
Tell me, how familiar are you
with Coluan
quantum mechanics? Hmm?

10:13.743 --> 10:15.789
Have you been trained
in hand-to-hand combat?

10:15.832 --> 10:17.268
Okay.

10:19.836 --> 10:24.232
All right, let's see
what gauntlet
you have for me this time.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.670
Cgyrzyx.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.805
-[people screaming]
-[female voice]
To obtain the Totem,

10:31.848 --> 10:35.199
inspire a hope
that burns longer
and brighter than the sun.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.206
[exhales]

10:42.250 --> 10:43.860
The "Hand of the Flower"
carved out of the throne

10:43.904 --> 10:47.037
that once belonged to Elpis,
the Greek Goddess of Hope.

10:47.081 --> 10:50.214
It must have been placed here
at The Hague as
a talisman of peace.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.173
I received my gauntlet.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.566
It said to inspire
a lasting hope.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.568
Luckily for you, Supergirl,
that's kind of on brand.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.136
Yeah, but the flower
won't budge for me.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.269
[strains, sighs]

11:01.312 --> 11:03.532
If Nyxly's able
to figure out the gauntlet

11:03.575 --> 11:06.840
and get this Hope Totem
out of the rock first...

11:06.883 --> 11:08.580
[Brown clears throat]

11:08.624 --> 11:10.931
Do either of you know
what that alien
did to my leaders?

11:10.974 --> 11:13.542
Half hour ago,
they were finally
starting to talk.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.762
Now they can't stop sniping
at each other.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.199
I can understand
Kaznia's anger.

11:18.242 --> 11:21.898
Corto Maltese did build
an island in the Kaznian
Sea without permission

11:21.942 --> 11:23.247
and started drilling for oil.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.119
That doesn't warrant
either country

11:25.162 --> 11:27.774
aiming their nuclear arsenal
at the other.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.863
The United States just needs
the region to remain stable,

11:29.906 --> 11:32.604
which is what I've been trying
to convince them both of.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.477
It appears that when that alien
transported out of here,

11:35.520 --> 11:37.392
the leaders were
hit with her energy.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.742
It has the power
to deplete people's courage.

11:39.786 --> 11:43.137
They don't look
afraid of each other
to me.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.660
I think you're right.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.097
But in this case,
it's made them distrustful,

11:47.141 --> 11:48.838
paranoid, that's
why they're arguing.

11:48.882 --> 11:51.145
J'onn, maybe you
should stay here
and guard the peace talks

11:51.188 --> 11:53.016
in case they deteriorate
or Nyxly comes back.

11:53.060 --> 11:56.324
I will talk them down again
so you superheroes can focus

11:56.367 --> 11:58.848
on capturing that alien
and stay in your lane.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.763
With all due respect,
Secretary,

12:00.807 --> 12:02.809
you're dealing
with a magical energy source.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.072
My psychic abilities
can keep things calm.

12:05.115 --> 12:09.206
Besides, if she comes back,
I'm the best defense
you'll have.

12:10.686 --> 12:11.818
Fine.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.298
Just don't get in my way.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.648
And change into something,
so you don't upstage me.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.699
Where is everyone?

12:23.743 --> 12:28.878
Downstairs. Alex is using
Brainy to help Esme
get used to her powers.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.186
I see you have
your mother's grimoire out.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.579
Does that mean you're
getting more
comfortable with it?

12:34.623 --> 12:37.147
[sighs] I just pretend
it's Newton's Principia,

12:37.191 --> 12:38.888
and that makes it
slightly easier to open.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.629
[both chuckle]

12:40.672 --> 12:43.023
There's still no luck
in finding Nyxly or that ship,

12:43.066 --> 12:46.504
so I thought maybe,
in the meantime,
I could try and find a charm

12:46.548 --> 12:48.158
that could help secure
the Humanity Totem

12:48.202 --> 12:50.682
against any magic
that Nyxly may
still have access to,

12:50.726 --> 12:52.380
just in case
she comes to find it here.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.383
Mmm-hmm. [huffs]
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

12:55.426 --> 12:59.213
[sighs] When I accessed
the Totem's gauntlet
at The Hague,

12:59.256 --> 13:01.868
it said I needed
to inspire a hope

13:01.911 --> 13:05.262
that burns longer and brighter
than the sun.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.743
But it didn't give me
a starting point
like last time,

13:07.787 --> 13:09.745
and I can't afford
to try and fail.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.442
I mean, you saw how
bad things got

13:11.486 --> 13:14.402
when I didn't pass
the Courage gauntlet.

13:14.445 --> 13:17.579
I try to provide people
with hope all the time.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.842
What can I do differently now?

13:21.235 --> 13:23.063
On the bright side,

13:23.106 --> 13:26.980
if it's a race between
you and Nyxly to provide
hope for a Hope Totem,

13:27.023 --> 13:28.895
I know where my money is going.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.027
-[Supergirl chuckles softly]
-[elevator opens]

13:32.594 --> 13:34.857
-Is Esme all right?
-Uh, yeah.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.076
Yeah, she's okay.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.947
I had her mimic Brainy,
then I asked her

13:37.991 --> 13:40.732
to solve the Coluan equivalent
of Einstein's theory
of relativity,

13:40.776 --> 13:42.778
but she got a little
overwhelmed
with the calculation,

13:42.822 --> 13:44.084
so we stopped.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.694
Do you think maybe
you could give a little hope

13:45.737 --> 13:47.870
to some little girl
who's down in the dumps?

13:47.914 --> 13:50.481
I mean, I know if she just
keeps trying,
she's gonna get it.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.006
For that little girl, anything.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.834
-El mayara.
-[Supergirl chuckles]

13:56.357 --> 13:58.838
But I'm still tired.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.275
I know that you're
tired, Esme, I do.

14:01.318 --> 14:06.933
But I really think
if we try again
and you just pushed through,

14:06.976 --> 14:09.065
you're gonna feel a lot better
about yourself, okay?

14:09.109 --> 14:11.894
And then you won't feel
so overwhelmed by your powers.

14:11.938 --> 14:15.985
And so, look,
I even brought you
Supergirl to mimic.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.378
[Supergirl chuckles]

14:21.034 --> 14:24.689
She has the same powers
as your sister Kara.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.214
You're the same
person, aren't you?

14:29.085 --> 14:31.174
Listen, Esme.
Sit down, sit down.

14:31.218 --> 14:34.612
Listen, not everybody
can know that.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.049
Okay? So that's
a private matter

14:36.092 --> 14:38.355
that we don't
really talk about,
all right?

14:40.053 --> 14:41.793
Am I in trouble?

14:41.837 --> 14:44.144
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Of course not, of course not.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.103
Now, since you're going
to be seeing Kara...

14:47.147 --> 14:49.149
Supergirl, a lot more,

14:49.192 --> 14:52.369
I want you to feel
more comfortable
around her powers.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.328
All right, so what do you say?

14:54.371 --> 14:56.156
Will you give it a go?

14:56.199 --> 14:58.114
Okay.

14:58.158 --> 15:01.161
So remember, Esme,
I'm an alien, just like you,
only I'm a Kryptonian,

15:01.204 --> 15:03.250
and the thing
about Kryptonians is
we get our powers

15:03.293 --> 15:06.166
when there's a
yellow sun around,
like there is here on Earth.

15:06.209 --> 15:09.604
We can fly,
we have heat vision,

15:09.647 --> 15:11.475
which some people
might think is scary,

15:11.519 --> 15:12.955
but let me tell you a secret.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.565
It really comes in handy

15:14.609 --> 15:16.611
when you want to make
a cup of hot chocolate.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.048
-[Alex gasps]
-[Supergirl chuckles]

15:19.092 --> 15:21.311
We also have this thing
called super hearing,

15:21.355 --> 15:25.011
which can get a little
overwhelming, but you
just have to take it slow.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.751
Do you want to try?

15:26.795 --> 15:29.537
All right. Okay,
I want you to
close your eyes...

15:30.451 --> 15:32.148
take a big, deep breath...

15:32.192 --> 15:33.671
[breathes deeply]

15:33.715 --> 15:36.544
and listen really closely
to Alex's heartbeat.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.198
[heart beating]

15:38.241 --> 15:39.286
Do you hear that?

15:39.329 --> 15:42.028
Yes, her heart
is beating so fast.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.247
[heart thumping]

15:44.291 --> 15:45.596
[jackhammer drilling]

15:45.640 --> 15:47.033
Ow! That hurt!

15:47.076 --> 15:49.122
Hey, it's okay.
You're okay, you're okay.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.298
It's just some
construction outside.
It's all right.

15:51.341 --> 15:54.127
Just don't let it
distract you, okay?
Just keep breathing...

15:54.170 --> 15:57.086
[breathes deeply] and search
for something new.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.870
Okay? Okay.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.136
[wings flapping]

16:03.179 --> 16:05.225
-Do you hear that?
-Yes.

16:05.268 --> 16:09.055
That is the sound
of a butterfly
flapping its wings.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.665
That's one of my favorites.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.408
-[car honks]
-[loud thud]

16:14.451 --> 16:16.976
-What was that? Make it stop.
-Just relax.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.630
All right? I just want you
to just push through

16:19.674 --> 16:21.937
and focus
on what you want to hear, okay?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.331
You really need to be able
to control these powers.

16:24.374 --> 16:28.422
And I feel like
if you really try,
you're gonna get it.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.640
Okay?

16:29.684 --> 16:31.033
Okay, okay. You're doing great.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.687
Deep breath, try again.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.385
[breathes deeply]

16:38.084 --> 16:41.043
-[siren wailing]
-[guns firing]

16:41.087 --> 16:43.480
-[guns firing]
-[people screaming]

16:43.524 --> 16:46.179
-Um...
-[children screaming]

16:46.222 --> 16:48.137
Why did you make
me listen to that?

16:48.181 --> 16:49.356
You're horrible!

16:54.143 --> 16:56.754
[exhales] I'll go after her.

16:57.146 --> 17:01.411
[sighing grimly]

17:05.459 --> 17:08.853
It's beautiful, watching
you control
the Totem's magic that way.

17:08.897 --> 17:12.292
Yes, but it's not
quite enough, is it,

17:12.335 --> 17:14.076
to pass the Hope
Totem's gauntlet?

17:14.859 --> 17:16.600
[sighs in exasperation]

17:17.993 --> 17:20.169
If only I had access
to all of my magic,

17:20.213 --> 17:23.651
I can pass this gauntlet
with the snap of my fingers.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.174
You know, when I was locked up,

17:25.218 --> 17:28.786
I always found myself
most hopeful
on Monday nights.

17:28.830 --> 17:32.486
Because... Tuesdays
meant tacos.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.053
Right.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.925
The point is,

17:36.968 --> 17:39.145
I'm never going to complete
the Hope gauntlet

17:39.188 --> 17:40.842
before Supergirl does.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.105
Hope is her expertise.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.065
It's not mine.

17:48.893 --> 17:52.114
I should let Supergirl
pass the gauntlet for me.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.596
I'm not following.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.337
If I let her obtain
the Hope Totem,

17:57.380 --> 18:00.688
I can barter it
and the Humanity
Totem from her.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.997
I just need... leverage.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.311
[chuckles] Oh.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.749
William Dey.

18:22.449 --> 18:28.107
Kaznia is merely defending
itself against
Corto Maltese's incursion!

18:28.498 --> 18:30.544
"Incursion"?

18:30.587 --> 18:32.372
We are not the aggressors here!
They are!

18:32.415 --> 18:35.462
President, Prime Minister,
you're misinterpreting
one another.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.342
Keep lying and
we will retaliate!

18:46.386 --> 18:48.170
Retaliate and we'll finish you!

18:48.214 --> 18:50.781
-Gentlemen, gentlemen.
-Gentlemen, gentlemen.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.219
I think it's wise
for us to take a brief recess.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.308
Let's return in half an hour.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.136
[people clamoring]

19:03.620 --> 19:05.753
You said you'd be able
to keep them calm.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.581
Yes, I did.

19:07.624 --> 19:11.062
But my psychic
energy cannot undo
the magic that's been used.

19:11.106 --> 19:14.370
And unfortunately,
that magic is still growing.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.157
You know what?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.549
If you can't calm them anymore,

19:19.593 --> 19:21.203
why don't you just
end run the problem?

19:21.247 --> 19:24.293
Just make them agree
with each other
and sign a treaty.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.643
You mean brainwash them?

19:26.687 --> 19:29.342
That, Secretary,
is a great overreach of power.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.474
You would only
be pushing through
the peace deal

19:31.518 --> 19:32.954
I'm sure I would have brokered

19:32.997 --> 19:34.216
if that alien attack
had never happened.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.175
With all due respect,

19:36.218 --> 19:37.219
you do not, in fact, know
you would have
accomplished that.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.742
[huffs] Oh.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.440
Imposing a will on others
can lead to dire consequences.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.790
Your team has done
its fair share of intervening

19:42.833 --> 19:44.792
since the dissolution
of the DEO.

19:44.835 --> 19:48.274
And now I haven't always agreed
with your actions.

19:48.317 --> 19:53.583
But today you asked me
to let you help, so help.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.326
Okay.

19:57.370 --> 20:01.417
I will continue
to keep things calm
while you can do your job.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.854
But if things get out of hand
and those missiles launch,

20:03.898 --> 20:06.030
I and my friends
will stop them.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.078
Hopefully, it's enough.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.952
[Supergirl sighs] It was awful.

20:14.996 --> 20:17.041
The look on Esme's face,

20:17.085 --> 20:19.653
the fear in her eyes
only hearing this...

20:19.696 --> 20:22.482
frightening, horrible stuff.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.919
[sighs] If I can't
help inspire hope

20:24.962 --> 20:26.355
in one little girl,
how am I supposed to do it

20:26.399 --> 20:28.923
for the whole world
and pass the Hope gauntlet?

20:28.966 --> 20:30.838
And this world?

20:30.881 --> 20:32.709
How is any of this hopeful?

20:32.753 --> 20:34.494
Things escalating at The Hague,
maybe you should

20:34.537 --> 20:37.323
just wipe those countries
of their nuclear weapons.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.455
That'll bring out
lasting peace and hope.

20:39.499 --> 20:42.328
I wish I could,
but unfortunately,
I am forbidden

20:42.371 --> 20:44.068
from interfering in
human history.

20:44.112 --> 20:46.027
Weren't you the person
that convinced me to use magic

20:46.070 --> 20:47.855
to make people
just a little bit violent

20:47.898 --> 20:50.336
in order to draw out Nyxly
and the Humanity Totem?

20:50.379 --> 20:51.859
Yeah, but that was different.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.077
That was in pursuit
of stopping a villain.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.123
And it was temporary.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.647
Unilaterally changing
the world stage,

20:57.691 --> 21:00.476
getting involved at that level,
that is not for me to do.

21:00.520 --> 21:04.959
People, nations should be
self-determining,
that's freedom.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.743
That's what we're fighting for.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.659
[gasps, shivers]

21:09.703 --> 21:10.834
What is it?

21:11.574 --> 21:12.749
It's Nyxly.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.145
She's happy about something.

21:17.188 --> 21:20.017
Maybe she's already figured out
how to pass the gauntlet.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.977
If you find a repel charm,
maybe we should
sprinkle some of that

21:23.020 --> 21:25.327
on the Hand of the Flower
to buy me some more time.

21:25.371 --> 21:26.763
I'm working on it.

21:28.504 --> 21:31.290
People taking to the streets,
children crying in fear

21:31.333 --> 21:33.988
that this conflict
will soon escalate to war.

21:34.031 --> 21:37.383
That news is not helping me
think of a way to
pass the gauntlet.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.908
Maybe that's the answer.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.084
What, turning off the news?
I don't think so.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.347
No, no, no, no.
So Supergirl does
hopeful things,

21:45.391 --> 21:47.610
but it's people like Kara
that helped frame the news

21:47.654 --> 21:50.526
in a way that makes
it not scary
and helps get the message out.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.572
It makes people hopeful.

21:52.615 --> 21:56.227
Maybe it's time for Kara to try
this gauntlet instead
of Supergirl.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.408
[Kelly] Esme, are you okay?

22:02.451 --> 22:05.324
I know what happened earlier
must have been scary.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.501
But we're here for you.

22:08.544 --> 22:11.808
Getting comfortable mimicking
other aliens' powers,

22:11.852 --> 22:15.159
it's going to take some time.

22:15.203 --> 22:17.814
And I know that Alex is sorry
that she pushed you.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.600
Hey, when we get home,

22:20.643 --> 22:23.124
why don't we finish
decorating your room?

22:23.167 --> 22:25.387
I think it's better
if we don't.

22:25.431 --> 22:29.304
I think it's better if you just
take me back
to the group home...

22:29.348 --> 22:31.698
before my powers hurt you too.

22:34.570 --> 22:35.919
[sighs softly]

22:36.616 --> 22:40.010
[breath trembling]

22:40.054 --> 22:42.056
[Kelly] Hey, I'll be
right back, okay?

22:43.187 --> 22:44.188
Okay.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.583
[breathes deeply]

22:49.455 --> 22:52.849
I really screwed up, Kelly.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.982
When Kara's powers
overwhelmed Esme,

22:55.025 --> 22:58.159
I should have realized
that she needed a break,

22:58.202 --> 23:00.466
but I just kept pushing her
to keep going.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.990
It was like
these instincts took over,

23:03.033 --> 23:04.426
and all of a sudden
I'm acting more like

23:04.470 --> 23:06.515
a DEO drill sergeant
than I am a mother.

23:06.559 --> 23:10.084
And it was exactly
the wrong thing to do.

23:10.127 --> 23:15.611
Growing up, my mom with Kara,
she was so kind
and understanding,

23:15.655 --> 23:17.787
and it was exactly the mom
that Kara needed.

23:17.831 --> 23:20.747
And that's everything
that I want to be.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.662
You're being really
hard on yourself.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.577
Your mom and Kara
fought all the time.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.927
You even told me that once
Kara got so angry with Eliza

23:26.970 --> 23:29.582
that she almost
burned the house down
with her heat vision.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.497
Kara was a teenager, okay,

23:31.540 --> 23:35.065
not some innocent little
ball of cuteness.

23:35.109 --> 23:40.419
My point is, they worked it out
and Kara thrived.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.770
And even your mother
needed that grace period.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.511
So cut yourself some slack.

23:48.209 --> 23:52.431
And this morning,
when Esme was scared,

23:53.736 --> 23:56.391
I wanted it to be
about her powers

23:56.435 --> 23:59.481
because that would have been
an easier fix.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.917
But it's not about that.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.180
It's us.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.618
Okay, so I was right.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.317
No. [sighs]

24:11.537 --> 24:15.062
She just told me
that she thinks
it's best if we take her back.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.586
And it wasn't because
you pushed her.

24:17.630 --> 24:23.287
I think she is terrified
of getting close to us

24:23.331 --> 24:26.639
because she thinks
we're gonna abandon
her like everyone else did.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.380
And I'm a therapist.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.121
I should have realized that
this morning.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.689
Mmm-mmm.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.954
I just...
I want to do better for Esme.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.521
I know you do.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.569
I just wish
we could make her see that.

24:44.308 --> 24:45.962
We can figure this out.

24:46.006 --> 24:49.705
We just got to figure out a way
to get her to see the truth.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.881
The truth.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.367
[chuckles softly]

25:02.588 --> 25:04.285
I know it's my first day
on Andrea's desk,

25:04.328 --> 25:06.374
but I just got to say
I loved your article

25:06.417 --> 25:08.681
on Martian Manhunter
keeping the peace talks safe.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.466
-Ms. Rojas is reading it now.
-Thanks, Don. Here.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.687
And Ms. Rojas is returning it
right to sender.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.080
Is there a problem?

25:17.124 --> 25:19.605
Firstly, I don't know why
you're suddenly doing stories

25:19.648 --> 25:23.652
on the Super Friends,
which is William's exclusive.

25:23.696 --> 25:26.220
You never struck me
as so catty or competitive.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.788
Just for the record,

25:28.831 --> 25:31.573
this story was not meant
to step on William's beat.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.967
William's stories
have been focusing
more on the threat,

25:34.010 --> 25:35.577
and I was more interested
in reporting

25:35.621 --> 25:37.231
on the positive developments

25:37.274 --> 25:38.667
happening in National City
and around the world.

25:38.711 --> 25:42.105
Why? The world
isn't good, Kara.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.064
-That's not true.
-[scoffs]

25:44.107 --> 25:47.154
Sure, bad things are happening,

25:47.197 --> 25:49.504
but if we only report
on the negative stuff,

25:49.548 --> 25:51.811
then people will start to see
and believe

25:51.854 --> 25:54.596
that the world is worse
than it actually is.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.729
There are good
things happening,

25:56.772 --> 25:59.732
and our readers deserve
that positive perspective.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.606
Nyxly.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.609
Huh.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.439
William Dey. Hmm.

26:11.482 --> 26:16.052
It's so good to finally
meet you. You know,
I'm a big fan of your work.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.493
-Can someone get
a camera on this?
-Andrea!

26:22.537 --> 26:25.714
Filming this?
That's a good idea.

26:25.758 --> 26:29.283
Because I need to
get a message out,
to Supergirl.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.981
I will kill this man

26:32.025 --> 26:35.376
unless she brings me
the Hope Totem
and the Humanity Totem

26:35.419 --> 26:36.856
right here by sunset.

26:36.899 --> 26:37.639
Don't you hurt him.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.598
[laughing]

26:49.520 --> 26:50.913
[gasps]

26:50.957 --> 26:54.700
I'm not going to play this game
with you, Supergirl.

26:54.743 --> 26:58.051
Bring me the Totems by sunset
or he dies.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.836
And after that,
I will use the Totem

27:00.880 --> 27:05.493
to make swathes
of people feel fear
until there's no hope left.

27:06.712 --> 27:07.669
Kind of like this.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.413
[Andrea] Whoa! Oh.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.023
-[breathing heavily]
Thank you, Supergirl.
-Yeah.

27:21.901 --> 27:25.252
[girl crying] Oh, no!

27:28.255 --> 27:29.691
[wind whooshing]

27:32.868 --> 27:35.044
[car screeching]

27:41.747 --> 27:42.661
Cgyrzyx.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.055
[wind blowing]

27:46.099 --> 27:48.144
[female voice]
You have failed the gauntlet.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.711
[exhales]

27:59.503 --> 28:01.070
[William] Supergirl
won't give you
those Totems.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.942
[sniffles] She'll find
another way.

28:02.985 --> 28:07.207
I've never seen a planet
so driven by naivete.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.165
And, you know,
you're quite the worst of them,

28:09.209 --> 28:12.168
with your devotion
to free press.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.779
You don't believe
in free press?

28:13.822 --> 28:15.084
Mmm-mmm.

28:15.128 --> 28:20.742
Journalism shines a light
on people in power.

28:20.786 --> 28:25.051
It ensures no
authoritarian impulse
goes unchecked.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.706
Much like yourself.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.317
If you think your
little newspaper

28:30.360 --> 28:33.755
has any impact
on those with real power,

28:33.799 --> 28:37.237
you're more delusional
than I thought.

28:37.280 --> 28:42.068
No, the powerful will
always believe
their way is righteous.

28:43.330 --> 28:44.766
I would know.

28:44.810 --> 28:49.815
My father was the
most powerful being
in my dimension.

28:52.556 --> 28:56.735
The more power he gained,
the more corrupt he became.

28:56.778 --> 28:59.085
I tried to show him
the error of his ways...

29:00.303 --> 29:02.001
and he decimated me.

29:05.831 --> 29:06.788
But soon...

29:08.224 --> 29:10.357
I will reunite the AllStone...

29:11.837 --> 29:14.665
and I will finally
set things right.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.887
[voice shaking] After
everything you've done...

29:20.497 --> 29:22.325
all of the chaos
you've wrought...

29:23.631 --> 29:26.677
you really think
you're delivering justice?

29:28.854 --> 29:29.811
Yeah.

29:37.253 --> 29:39.908
[Lena breathing deeply]

29:41.692 --> 29:45.784
[in Latin] Avertat ab eis
et advenam opprimebant.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.178
[gasps]

29:54.880 --> 29:57.578
[Brainy] The charm
is very short term.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.710
Am I correct in assuming
that wasn't your intention?

30:04.193 --> 30:05.368
I tried the articles.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.588
I couldn't get the Totem.

30:07.631 --> 30:10.721
I saved cats from trees
and people from crime.

30:10.765 --> 30:13.072
I flew over Kaznia
and Corto Maltese,

30:13.115 --> 30:14.856
telling the people
I wouldn't let them down.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.032
Couldn't get the Totem.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.991
I have no idea

30:19.034 --> 30:20.688
if trying and failing is making
things worse for
Secretary Brown.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.908
The situation at The Hague
is devolving.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.693
We need to find Nyxly,

30:25.736 --> 30:27.651
or come up with some way
to save William

30:27.695 --> 30:29.566
without giving
her either Totem.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.960
Please tell me
you two have some good news.

30:34.093 --> 30:36.225
I'm sorry, Kara.
I wish I did, but...

30:36.269 --> 30:40.534
I haven't been able to locate
Nyxly, William or
Naxim's ship anywhere.

30:40.577 --> 30:45.887
And my protective charm
is more of a practice zap
at the moment.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.671
It's not gonna be
enough to protect

30:47.715 --> 30:49.848
either the Humanity
or the Hope Totem
from Nyxly.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.074
Hey, Esme. Um...

31:00.946 --> 31:06.473
I am really sorry
that I pushed you
to practice so hard today.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.259
We got you another present,

31:10.303 --> 31:12.348
but you have to come with us
to see it.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.698
Do you want to?

31:15.786 --> 31:16.613
Okay.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.225
Here.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.141
I'll hold your hand too.

31:22.184 --> 31:25.753
So, he's more
like a pet, really.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.929
He's called a Truth Seeker.

31:27.973 --> 31:31.933
Anyone who touches it,
they can only tell the truth.

31:31.977 --> 31:36.285
So that means when
you're around him,
you have his powers too.

31:36.329 --> 31:40.028
So you can be 100%
absolutely certain

31:40.072 --> 31:43.945
that everything we say to you
is the truth.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.993
We have something important
to tell you.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.559
Do you want to try it out?

31:49.603 --> 31:52.998
Okay. You want to
hold our hands?
Yeah.

31:53.041 --> 31:59.700
We are never, ever
gonna send you away. Okay?

31:59.743 --> 32:03.747
No matter what you do,
no matter what you say.

32:03.791 --> 32:07.099
Even if your powers
get big and confusing,

32:07.142 --> 32:10.624
even if you never want
to use your powers again.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.366
We're your family now, Esme.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.368
And we're gonna grow together.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.674
And you're going to
make some mistakes,

32:17.718 --> 32:19.024
and we're going
to make mistakes.

32:19.067 --> 32:22.114
I made mistakes earlier today.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.116
But we're going to learn
from one another.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.422
And the most important thing...

32:27.771 --> 32:30.992
through it all,
we'll do it together.

32:31.036 --> 32:35.344
I had a family before
but bad things
happened to them...

32:36.215 --> 32:37.346
and I was alone.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.397
Do you want to know what your
new family does for a living?

32:47.052 --> 32:49.315
-We're superheroes.
-[Kelly gasps]

32:49.358 --> 32:53.145
Yeah. So that means that you
don't have to worry about us.

32:53.188 --> 32:57.105
Because it's our job
to face all the bad things.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.586
And you know what?

33:00.630 --> 33:03.068
-We're really good at it.
-Mmm-hmm.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.460
[all chuckle]

33:06.245 --> 33:07.594
I believe you.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.424
The talks broke
down completely.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.992
The Corto Maltesian
Prime Minister
said he felt threatened.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.037
Governments in both nations
have issued lockdowns

33:16.081 --> 33:19.214
as military leaders
flock to their
respective capitals.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.651
Allies were concerned
that if one of the nations

33:21.695 --> 33:23.262
launches a nuclear missile,

33:23.305 --> 33:25.960
the conflict could have
global consequences.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.657
[voice shaking] This morning,
I was so hopeful.

33:27.701 --> 33:30.138
Thinking about Esme, about...

33:30.182 --> 33:34.229
a future that was
so much brighter
than yesterday, and now this.

33:34.273 --> 33:37.928
This is what lies ahead of us.
[sighs wearily]

33:40.192 --> 33:41.367
I can't have it.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.371
I won't have it.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.068
If they launch those missiles,
we will stop them.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.722
We have to do more
than that, J'onn.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.289
Didn't you say you weren't
supposed to interfere?

33:50.332 --> 33:52.900
I did, but someone
is interfering
with human history

33:52.943 --> 33:55.468
who doesn't care
about humanity or hope.

33:55.511 --> 33:58.427
And I will do whatever it takes
to protect this planet,

33:58.471 --> 34:00.560
including disarming
those countries,

34:00.603 --> 34:05.304
so that the people don't have
to fear tomorrow or the
next day or the next.

34:05.347 --> 34:09.047
You'll inspire a hope that
burns longer and
brighter than the sun.

34:10.265 --> 34:11.397
And get that Totem.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.746
[sighs]

34:14.313 --> 34:15.792
[keyboard clacking]

34:15.836 --> 34:18.012
I'm accessing Kaznian
and Corto Maltese military data

34:18.056 --> 34:20.101
and downloading the location
of their missile silos,

34:20.145 --> 34:22.016
so Lena can direct you
to them over comms.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.192
I calculate you should have
all the missiles removed

34:24.236 --> 34:26.107
and the Hope
Totem in your hands

34:26.151 --> 34:27.674
with several minutes to spare
before Nyxly's clock runs out.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.763
And then you can use the Totems
against Nyxly.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.634
No. No, absolutely not.

34:31.678 --> 34:34.159
Even if Supergirl can wield
the Totems'
powers, it's too risky.

34:34.202 --> 34:37.075
Every time a Totem's been used,
we've had untold consequences.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.598
But trading the
Totems for William...

34:38.641 --> 34:40.078
My protective
charm isn't enough

34:40.121 --> 34:41.688
to stop Nyxly
from using it for herself.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.168
Your charm may be weak,

34:43.211 --> 34:44.604
but it could be what we need
to turn the tide.

34:44.647 --> 34:47.781
Unfortunately,
the tide did just turn.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.479
Corto Maltese just fired
the first missile.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.225
[alarm blaring]

34:57.269 --> 35:01.099
[people screaming]

35:03.318 --> 35:08.106
-[boy exclaiming]
-[people screaming]

35:11.587 --> 35:15.156
[in Kaznian]

35:16.070 --> 35:17.550
[in Kaznian]

35:21.771 --> 35:23.077
[J'onn J'onzz]
Supergirl, I got it.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.179
[metal creaking]

35:38.223 --> 35:39.267
Nice.

35:40.660 --> 35:44.229
[metal creaking, clunking]

35:44.272 --> 35:47.232
I'll hold them
while you disarm the arsenals.

35:47.275 --> 35:50.670
You take Corto Maltese.
I've got a soft
spot for Kaznia.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.106
You got it.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.598
Brainy and I will
fly the missiles
into the sun,

36:05.641 --> 36:07.208
where they won't be able
to hurt anyone.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.169
I hope this is enough
to get the Totem.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.307
[breathing heavily]

36:19.351 --> 36:20.178
Cgyrzyx!

36:23.442 --> 36:26.575
[female voice] You have
performed admirably.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.100
Lena, I'm heading your way now.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.934
I have what you want, Nyxly.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.284
Let him go.

36:39.327 --> 36:42.025
Give me what I want first.

36:45.464 --> 36:46.769
Suit yourself.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.469
[yells in pain] Ah!

36:50.512 --> 36:51.600
Run!

36:52.427 --> 36:53.820
[grunts]

36:53.863 --> 36:56.475
You tried to use
magic against me.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.607
-Don't hurt him.
-I'm not hurting him.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.566
You are.

37:00.609 --> 37:04.309
[straining] You talk about me
like I don't...

37:05.440 --> 37:06.441
get a say.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.275
[gasping] But I do.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.759
[breathing heavily]

37:20.716 --> 37:22.718
You're not in my head anymore.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.460
-I guess hope does trump fear.
-No.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.377
I won't be undone.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.303
[sighs in exasperation]

37:50.268 --> 37:54.489
[J'onn J'onzz] Humanity,
Hope and Courage.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.536
We now have three
of the seven Totems
in our possession,

37:57.579 --> 37:59.233
and Nyxly has none.

38:00.539 --> 38:03.542
We keep doing the same thing
over and over again.

38:03.585 --> 38:07.589
Going from Totem to Totem,
trying to beat Nyxly
at her own game.

38:07.633 --> 38:10.636
[sighs] Maybe that's a mistake.

38:10.679 --> 38:13.160
Today, we were able
to keep the Totems
safe from Nyxly,

38:13.203 --> 38:16.381
but we might not be
so lucky next time.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.905
And she's never
going to give up.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.820
As long as we
hold on to these Totems,

38:20.863 --> 38:24.389
we run the risk of her
eventually being able
to assemble the AllStone.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.479
Certainly, it's a risk,
but what
alternative do we have?

38:27.522 --> 38:31.483
Destroy the Totems,
just like we did the nukes.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.398
The Totems possess an ancient,

38:33.441 --> 38:36.575
deeply ingrained magic
that we don't
really understand.

38:36.618 --> 38:39.491
But what we do know is that
each Totem is
related to an element.

38:39.534 --> 38:41.319
It's Courage, Hope, Humanity.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.234
If we destroy the Totems,

38:44.278 --> 38:46.411
that could affect the elements
in the real world.

38:46.454 --> 38:50.893
That may be true, but we don't
have to destroy
all three Totems.

38:50.937 --> 38:56.595
So long as we destroy one,
the AllStone will
never be complete.

38:56.638 --> 39:01.426
But how do we decide
which to risk,
courage, humanity or hope?

39:01.469 --> 39:03.602
We've seen what happens
when humanity's compromised.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.560
That is not an option.

39:05.604 --> 39:08.563
And watching those
diplomats today, with
their courage stripped away.

39:08.607 --> 39:11.871
I don't want to see what that
looks like on a global scale.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.263
It has to be hope.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.745
We proved that...

39:16.789 --> 39:18.965
even when the world
has lost all hope,

39:19.008 --> 39:21.533
we can be the example
to bring it back.

39:21.576 --> 39:24.797
Even if there are consequences
to destroying the Hope Totem,

39:24.840 --> 39:26.102
we can do it again.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.456
Okay, arms out.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.327
There we go.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.330
Okay, so we showed you
the Truth Seeker

39:36.374 --> 39:39.333
so that you would know
that we're always
telling you the truth.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.945
But we also know that
he didn't solve everything.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.557
We're here to help you.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.603
We want you to work
through all the feelings
you're feeling.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.608
I love my room.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.263
[both chuckle]

39:58.613 --> 40:00.136
Okay.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.225
-Night-night.
-Good night.

40:05.359 --> 40:10.538
[groans] No one tells you how
being a mom brings up all
of your past struggles.

40:10.582 --> 40:13.193
Yeah. Or your
worst insecurities.

40:14.455 --> 40:15.413
But...

40:16.065 --> 40:17.458
the truth is...

40:19.329 --> 40:22.681
[voice shaking] it's so much
better than I ever
would have imagined.

40:22.724 --> 40:23.812
Oh, baby.

40:23.856 --> 40:26.946
[both chuckle]

40:46.922 --> 40:48.315
No.

40:57.542 --> 41:01.067
[voice shaking]
Supergirl just destroyed
the Hope Totem.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.373
Now the AllStone
will never be whole.

41:18.127 --> 41:19.346
What is it?

41:28.877 --> 41:30.531
"Secret admirer"?

41:35.710 --> 41:36.494
[beeps]

41:51.683 --> 41:53.946
[theme music playing]
