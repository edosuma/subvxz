WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:03.003
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:03.046 --> 00:03.829
[snarling]

00:03.873 --> 00:04.700
Go!

00:04.743 --> 00:05.614
[machine gun fire]

00:05.657 --> 00:06.963
[screaming]

00:07.007 --> 00:07.964
They're Ferals.

00:08.008 --> 00:08.834
No, not anymore.

00:08.878 --> 00:09.879
They're Daywalkers.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.098
We don't have enough firepower.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.012
We do now.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.143
[heavy thudding]

00:13.187 --> 00:14.971
Ammo tipped with aluminum
silicide.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.103
A poison I engineer,

00:16.146 --> 00:17.756
made from the same
base chemical

00:17.800 --> 00:19.454
Blak Tek was using
in your repellant.

00:19.497 --> 00:22.239
The chemical that repels them
could also poison them.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.850
This path you have
always walked.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.069
[gravely] I'll never become
an elder.

00:26.113 --> 00:29.420
If not you, then him.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.814
[growling]
Let it be me.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.294
So I just need to go back
to the lab,

00:33.337 --> 00:35.644
get the results of the tests
and get out of here, okay?

00:35.687 --> 00:37.559
No. I made Scab.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.822
I've gotta make this right.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.520
I keep them,
I kill you.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.695
[desperately]
Julius!

00:43.739 --> 00:44.783
Don't do it.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.394
You will end
the Dark One.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.264
Please don't...

00:47.308 --> 00:48.831
[screams in pain]

00:50.267 --> 00:55.142
Now you have
become Elder.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.230
Lily!

00:56.273 --> 00:59.885
The Van Helsings end now.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.765
What is that hellish beast?

01:09.808 --> 01:11.419
A nightmare I have to kill.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.116
There is another way,
trust me.

01:13.160 --> 01:19.731
There is no other way.
The Van Helsings end now.

01:21.168 --> 01:28.305
[groaning]

01:28.349 --> 01:33.441
Is that the sickly sweet smell
of Van Helsing blood

01:33.484 --> 01:36.531
coursing through your veins?

01:36.574 --> 01:37.967
[growls]

01:38.010 --> 01:42.841
Your resurrection will be...
brief.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.278
You said there's another way
out of here?

01:44.321 --> 01:47.411
Yes, but to use it we must get
past him and escape.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.761
Oh, there's no escape.

01:49.805 --> 01:53.243
Only death.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.810
After you.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.508
Okay, come on, come on,
come on.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.859
[screams in pain]

02:03.340 --> 02:04.733
Bye.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.648
[crashing]

02:07.170 --> 02:10.434
[grunting]

02:10.478 --> 02:12.741
[metal clanging]

02:13.350 --> 02:18.268
You could've stopped me years
ago when I was still human.

02:18.312 --> 02:21.315
[growls]

02:21.358 --> 02:23.665
But then I killed Susan.

02:23.708 --> 02:27.016
[roars]

02:28.278 --> 02:35.938
Oh, the blood I've spilled
since...

02:35.981 --> 02:38.419
Since killing her.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.291
Your fault!

02:41.335 --> 02:42.988
[crash]

02:46.688 --> 02:51.562
[groaning] I kill you now,
all is forgiven.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.348
[grunting]

02:54.391 --> 02:56.741
Make me.

02:56.785 --> 02:59.309
This darkness is yours.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.138
[screaming in agony]

03:02.182 --> 03:05.185
My destiny is just beginning...

03:05.228 --> 03:07.143
[screaming in agony]

03:07.187 --> 03:09.841
As yours ends.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.060
[knife slicing]

03:11.103 --> 03:12.583
[grunting]

03:12.627 --> 03:15.934
In the name of my grandfather,
Abraham Van Helsing,

03:15.978 --> 03:17.675
I send you to hell!

03:17.719 --> 03:19.024
[grunting]

03:29.644 --> 03:31.863
[yelling]

03:34.126 --> 03:37.042
[dramatic music]

03:43.484 --> 03:44.963
[gasps]

03:57.280 --> 03:58.281
Stop.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.414
You must not.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.677
I know the path
to the Dark One,

04:02.720 --> 04:06.333
but to take it we need
a Van Helsing.

04:06.376 --> 04:09.640
Destroy that which seeks
to destroy us.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.990
Your words.

04:12.034 --> 04:15.298
One, not both.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.821
[quietly] It is
my right.

04:16.865 --> 04:22.740
No, you will do as
I command.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.789
[grunts]

04:29.486 --> 04:34.143
You don't control me.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.710
But I do.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.755
Always will.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.976
And I too have a destiny,
and you will play your part.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.978
[hisses]

04:43.021 --> 04:49.637
I kill who I wish!

04:49.680 --> 04:55.686
I do what I wish!

04:55.730 --> 04:57.514
[hisses]
No!!!

04:59.473 --> 05:01.388
Finally a challenge.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.041
[grunts]

05:03.085 --> 05:08.133
Death has always been
my true companion.

05:08.177 --> 05:08.960
No.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.788
[growls]

05:12.094 --> 05:14.444
We have to go, now.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.230
I have always been there
by your side.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.581
I've only seen you for
who you really are,

05:20.624 --> 05:22.887
chose you.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.541
Drawn to your darkness.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.673
Come on.

05:25.716 --> 05:26.978
Not back in the maze.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.676
Trust me.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.242
Why me?

05:30.286 --> 05:36.466
Salvation of the Dark One,
through you, entwined in you.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.946
Through here.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.472
This place.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.952
My sister.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.740
Let me show you
what you can become.

05:49.784 --> 05:54.049
But first, you must surrender
your will to me and do as I say.

05:54.092 --> 05:57.966
I've never been a follower.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.098
Let me guide you now.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.144
Be yours.

06:02.187 --> 06:05.321
Until the end.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.891
Tell me what I must do.

06:12.241 --> 06:15.375
She was here.

06:15.418 --> 06:19.291
In the maze?
What happened?

06:19.335 --> 06:21.511
She died.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.560
The amulet.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.609
We must hurry.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.702
[ominous music]

06:38.746 --> 06:43.054
Find the blood amulet
and the Van Helsings.

06:43.098 --> 06:46.493
Keep one alive.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.758
[snarls]

06:52.107 --> 06:54.544
We must keep this amulet away
from them.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.676
If it falls into their hands,

06:55.719 --> 06:57.504
we may no longer control
our own destiny.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.027
This is a dead end.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.332
Your eyesight is recovering.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.595
How is that possible?

07:01.638 --> 07:02.987
If you know of another way
out of here,

07:03.031 --> 07:04.162
we need to find it now.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.729
Here.

07:05.773 --> 07:06.904
What are you doing?

07:06.948 --> 07:08.645
Attempting to recollect
the combination.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.952
My mother told me many stories
about this place.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.781
Including a clue to get out,
if I can remember it.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.783
So, if you please.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.532
Thank you, mother.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.012
Let's go, quickly.

07:28.056 --> 07:38.066
[tense music]

07:45.073 --> 07:49.033
[yelling]
Vanessa!

07:58.739 --> 08:00.044
If they want this amulet
so badly,

08:00.088 --> 08:01.568
why don't we just destroy it?

08:01.611 --> 08:02.438
We tried.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.527
Nothing worked.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.791
What?...

08:07.835 --> 08:11.055
What year is this?

08:11.099 --> 08:11.969
Lily.

08:12.013 --> 08:17.148
How long have I been gone?

08:17.192 --> 08:19.020
[sighs]

08:19.063 --> 08:21.675
More than 100 years.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.026
No.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.122
How?

08:34.165 --> 08:36.951
How did it go this wrong?

08:40.955 --> 08:42.347
Come on.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.567
Scab.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.352
It's me you want.

08:47.396 --> 08:50.486
It's me you've
always wanted.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.444
Just let me kill him for you.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.273
Oh.

08:55.317 --> 08:58.015
What is that, Scab?

08:58.059 --> 08:59.843
You're scared
to face me?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.671
[snarls]

09:01.715 --> 09:04.369
Just like old times,
huh?

09:04.413 --> 09:08.765
Stronger now than
you can imagine.

09:08.809 --> 09:13.204
I have become a Sister.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.728
Well that's weird.

09:14.771 --> 09:15.859
But you know what,
Scab?

09:15.903 --> 09:17.600
You've always been weak.

09:17.644 --> 09:22.170
You have always been a follower
and you always will be.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.998
Always.

09:24.041 --> 09:27.610
And you are a pathetic human,

09:27.654 --> 09:30.874
fallen from the heights
of what you were.

09:30.918 --> 09:35.749
I will bathe in the blood
that I tear from your veins!

09:36.706 --> 09:38.708
[roars]

09:40.101 --> 09:41.102
Shit.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.583
[machine gun fires]

09:48.500 --> 09:50.981
[grunting]

09:53.680 --> 09:55.246
No match for me.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.857
Not anymore.

09:56.900 --> 09:57.727
[roars]

09:57.771 --> 09:59.381
[crash]

10:02.297 --> 10:05.126
You know you talk
too much?

10:05.169 --> 10:07.128
[grunting]

10:07.171 --> 10:08.782
She didn't.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.218
Your woman.

10:10.261 --> 10:12.699
I sucked the life right
out of her.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.222
[groans]

10:14.265 --> 10:17.704
[dramatic music]

10:17.747 --> 10:21.229
[gunfire]

10:23.666 --> 10:26.451
[screaming]

10:34.329 --> 10:36.505
[grunts]

10:36.548 --> 10:38.681
This is for Frankie.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.379
This is for my Mom.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.773
And I'm sorry I ever
made you.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.820
[grunting]

10:49.605 --> 10:50.824
It worked.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.390
It killed them.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.783
All right, we gotta get
those people out.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.437
Let's go!

10:55.480 --> 10:56.307
Yes sir.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.483
Clear the fence!

11:00.964 --> 11:02.705
All right, let's go.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.489
Move 'em out!

11:04.533 --> 11:05.839
The poison bullets
aren't working!

11:05.882 --> 11:07.318
They're getting back up!

11:08.276 --> 11:09.146
Run!

11:09.190 --> 11:10.582
Run!!!!!

11:11.105 --> 11:12.323
Move, move, move,
move, move!

11:12.367 --> 11:13.281
Let's go!

11:13.324 --> 11:15.022
Get up. Get up.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.763
Get up!

11:16.806 --> 11:18.112
[alarm blares]

11:18.155 --> 11:19.548
[P.A] This sector has
been breached.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.332
All citizens must evacuate
immediately...

11:29.558 --> 11:32.648
[Maddox] I want you to find
that doctor, you understand?!

11:32.692 --> 11:36.086
I want every square inch
of this place searched!

11:38.785 --> 11:39.611
You hear me?

11:39.655 --> 11:40.656
Find her.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.355
To the gate.

11:45.487 --> 11:46.880
Oh, shit!

11:48.795 --> 11:49.970
I got him.

11:50.013 --> 11:50.840
Get down.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.363
[gunshots]

11:52.407 --> 11:53.321
It didn't work.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.497
Get behind us!
They are coming!

11:55.540 --> 11:57.107
The second that path clears,

11:57.151 --> 11:59.022
you make a run for that gate
as fast as you can.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.502
-You got that?
-Copy.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.809
[gunshots]

12:02.852 --> 12:04.158
[grunting]

12:04.201 --> 12:06.726
Let's finish this.

12:06.769 --> 12:16.736
[fighting grunts]

12:22.306 --> 12:25.048
[gunshots]

12:25.092 --> 12:26.093
Ah, shit!

12:38.366 --> 12:41.151
[yells]

12:44.851 --> 12:46.243
Julius!

12:48.724 --> 12:50.465
[screams]

12:57.602 --> 12:59.735
No.

12:59.779 --> 13:05.480
Make her watch
as I finish him.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.659
Say it.

13:10.702 --> 13:15.490
[panting]

13:20.930 --> 13:23.237
Look.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.416
Say it.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.421
[weakly]
Master.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.818
[mournful music]

[screeching]

14:20.337 --> 14:22.731
[gate rattling]

14:22.774 --> 14:25.255
Let us in!

14:25.299 --> 14:26.126
Where's Nguyen?

14:26.169 --> 14:27.040
He's dead.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.128
Just let us in.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.042
This sector's not secure.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.000
I can't defy orders.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.045
You have to let us in!

14:32.088 --> 14:35.135
We're here, come on!
Let us in!

14:35.178 --> 14:36.484
Please let us in!

14:36.527 --> 14:39.748
[gasping]

14:39.791 --> 14:42.229
[growling]

14:43.230 --> 14:45.188
[muttering]

14:45.232 --> 14:47.451
I'm sorry, there's nothing
I can do.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.801
Stand back.
Stand back!

14:49.845 --> 14:53.022
[yells] Stand the áááá down
before I blow his brains out.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.896
Okay, okay, come on,
let's go!

14:57.679 --> 14:59.899
[gunfire]

14:59.942 --> 15:01.291
[growls]

15:05.252 --> 15:07.602
-Doc...
-Oh, my god!

15:07.645 --> 15:09.952
Doc, you opened
the gate.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.954
You saved our lives.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.915
[laughs]

15:15.958 --> 15:20.484
Yeah, I did.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.095
Put the weapon down.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.966
One second.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.752
Check her bag.

15:28.710 --> 15:31.060
Where is the report?

15:31.104 --> 15:32.235
What report?

15:32.279 --> 15:33.236
I know you deleted it.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.934
Where's the copy?

15:37.066 --> 15:37.980
Oh, okay.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.286
You want to play it like that.

15:39.329 --> 15:42.289
We'll get the answers,
one way or the other.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.509
Wait, no, no, wait, wait!

15:45.553 --> 15:48.034
She saved our lives.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.037
Are you seeing this?

15:52.777 --> 15:54.127
Yeah.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.955
Take him as well.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.875
I'll get to the bottom of this.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.182
I promise you that.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.494
Ease up, ease up! Where the hell
are you taking us?

16:13.537 --> 16:17.150
Someplace safe, where we can
talk without interruption.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.281
Get 'em ready to board.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.152
What?

16:19.195 --> 16:20.544
You can't just fly away.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.764
You made the mess, it's
your job to clean it up.

16:22.807 --> 16:25.549
They've already taken over
half the city.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.597
The silicide isn't working
on the Daywalkers.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.990
We're being overrun.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.730
Stay calm, Max.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.732
I'm sending reinforcements.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.214
[flight announcement]

16:38.258 --> 16:41.174
The second we get airborne,
deploy the canisters.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.392
Canisters?

16:42.436 --> 16:43.263
For what?

16:43.306 --> 16:44.220
Nerve agent.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.743
Weapon of last resort.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.268
But that won't do anything
to the vampires.

16:48.311 --> 16:49.704
Oh, my god.

16:49.747 --> 16:50.618
Get 'em out of here.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.663
You can't do this!

16:52.707 --> 16:53.925
That'll kill everyone else.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.014
Get 'em outta here.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.276
[yells]
Don't do this!

16:56.319 --> 16:59.279
[helicopter whirrs]

17:02.282 --> 17:05.372
What reinforcements?!

17:19.342 --> 17:23.651
[groaning]

17:23.694 --> 17:29.222
[agonized yelling]

17:29.265 --> 17:32.094
He did this to me!

17:32.138 --> 17:34.618
Julian!

17:34.662 --> 17:35.837
Rest.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.099
Heal.

17:37.143 --> 17:41.234
In time, you will have
your revenge.

17:41.277 --> 17:45.542
I don't think I have
the strength...

17:52.419 --> 17:54.203
[yelps]

17:56.553 --> 17:57.598
Please!

17:57.641 --> 17:59.295
I can help you.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.863
I know where they went!

18:01.906 --> 18:03.995
The only help that you
can provide is what pulses

18:04.039 --> 18:05.084
through your veins.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.173
[growling]

18:07.782 --> 18:10.219
[gurgling]

18:16.878 --> 18:19.185
We must find them.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.535
We need a Van Helsing.

18:21.578 --> 18:22.797
Why are we still here?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.712
What is this?

18:24.755 --> 18:28.455
A pathway forward.

18:28.498 --> 18:33.024
The gateway of all
we have set in motion.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.765
The Dark One?

18:34.809 --> 18:36.724
Yes.

18:36.767 --> 18:40.771
Points on a black star.

18:40.815 --> 18:44.384
We must find the others.

18:44.427 --> 18:45.820
Others?

18:45.863 --> 18:48.562
In time, you will know
everything.

18:48.605 --> 18:51.652
Now give me back
the blood amulet.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.744
No.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.181
No, you let them flee with it.

18:59.225 --> 19:02.619
If you had let me kill them
when I could,

19:02.663 --> 19:05.187
you would have the blood now.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.624
We must move quickly.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.713
Send word.

19:18.592 --> 19:28.602
[speaking Latin]

19:30.517 --> 19:31.953
Ahhhh!!!!!

19:34.912 --> 19:36.958
Return to the beginning!

19:37.001 --> 19:39.134
Prepare for the awakening.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.919
Mother of your sisters.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.878
Bride of my beloved,

19:43.921 --> 19:50.101
bear witness and bow down as the
darkness consumes the light.

19:52.060 --> 19:56.325
[roars]

19:58.762 --> 19:59.676
Ivory.

20:00.764 --> 20:01.939
Ivory.

20:01.983 --> 20:05.073
[panting]

20:05.116 --> 20:08.903
I see our path now.

20:08.946 --> 20:13.560
Our mother will rise.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.257
She will rise.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.216
[panting]

20:18.129 --> 20:20.131
Who is she?

20:20.175 --> 20:23.134
The mother who shall rise?

20:23.178 --> 20:25.876
Beloved of the Dark One.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.924
The second of three.

20:29.967 --> 20:34.537
Teach me everything.

20:34.581 --> 20:38.411
I can give you the greatest gift
you have ever known.

20:38.454 --> 20:42.284
The ability to be more than
you ever thought possible.

20:42.328 --> 20:47.071
Perhaps to become
the Dark One yourself.

20:47.115 --> 20:53.817
But your loyalty must remain
with me always.

20:53.861 --> 20:57.081
Can you make that pact?

21:04.175 --> 21:09.659
And in return, I can teach you
to be anything you wish,

21:09.703 --> 21:13.750
have anything you desire.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.491
Would you like that?

21:16.405 --> 21:18.059
Yes.

21:18.102 --> 21:20.540
Then come, my love.

21:20.583 --> 21:24.370
Our fates must become entwined.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.678
Drink from me.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.159
[snarls]

21:31.202 --> 21:34.031
[blood squelching]

21:37.208 --> 21:41.082
[radio instructs]
All right, clear the LC.
We got a hawk coming in...

21:41.125 --> 21:42.257
Hansen?

21:42.910 --> 21:45.565
Hansen?

21:45.608 --> 21:49.264
Hansen, are you even listening
to me?

21:49.308 --> 21:53.573
Years of effort to take back
some of what we lost,

21:53.616 --> 21:57.751
to establish a safe city,
and now in a matter of hours,

21:57.794 --> 21:59.579
Denver has fallen.

21:59.622 --> 22:02.190
You have to take account
for your actions.

22:02.233 --> 22:05.280
I wasn't prepared to allow
the vampires to capture it.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.629
[slams hands on table]

22:06.673 --> 22:08.370
There were thousands
of people.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.067
Who would've been
turned into food,

22:10.111 --> 22:12.548
or worse, a growing army
of Daywalkers.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.855
Would that be more preferable
to you?

22:14.898 --> 22:17.945
Blak Tek was supposed to be
providing solutions.

22:17.988 --> 22:19.468
Hope.

22:19.512 --> 22:23.690
Now all we have is a greater
crisis and a worse enemy.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.344
That's on you.

22:25.387 --> 22:30.000
With every loss,
there are certain gains.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.133
Lessons to be learned.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.048
What?

22:34.091 --> 22:35.745
It takes a few broken eggs
to make an omelette?

22:35.789 --> 22:37.791
Don't you dare flip
the narrative.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.314
No, no, that's very good,
Miss Avery.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.576
Very, very good.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.665
In fact, that analogy
is kind of perfect.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.365
Come on.
Get over here.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.587
Who the hell are they?

22:51.631 --> 22:54.068
Uh, eggs.

22:54.111 --> 22:56.679
A Denver omelette, if you will.

22:56.723 --> 23:00.204
Blak Tek was supposed to find a
cure for this vampire situation.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.728
We went through so many
amazing things,

23:01.771 --> 23:04.861
but in the end the result was...
disappointing.

23:04.905 --> 23:07.255
That's a hell of
an understatement.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.388
This goddamn Daywalker virus,

23:09.431 --> 23:11.738
it was made by Blak Tek,
wasn't it?

23:11.781 --> 23:13.957
That rogue Frankenstein
operation

23:14.001 --> 23:15.306
you were running
in the mountains.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.743
It was a project
that went astray.

23:16.786 --> 23:19.136
A project that spawned
an epidemic.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.139
Mutant vampires that
we can't defend against.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.664
Or can we?

23:24.707 --> 23:29.538
In the jaws of defeat,
perhaps there lies victory.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.411
But to get there,
excuse me.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.238
Thank you.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.850
A few eggs get broken.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.547
[gunfire]

23:38.591 --> 23:40.027
[gasps]

23:42.551 --> 23:44.205
Thank you.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.772
Are you insane?

23:45.815 --> 23:47.121
What the hell did you
just do?

23:47.164 --> 23:49.819
Shh.

23:51.342 --> 23:52.996
Wait for it.

23:55.477 --> 24:02.571
[groans]

24:06.140 --> 24:08.751
What the hell, man?

24:08.795 --> 24:10.492
[whispers]
That's not possible.

24:10.536 --> 24:11.841
You son of a bitch.

24:11.885 --> 24:12.755
Get off me!

24:12.799 --> 24:13.626
Get off me.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.062
All right?

24:15.105 --> 24:18.065
I just took a bullet to
the ticker, would you relax?

24:21.285 --> 24:22.373
That's not possible.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.638
It shouldn't be,
but it is now.

24:25.681 --> 24:29.076
Only Daywalkers can heal
from a fatal shot like that.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.425
Is... is he?

24:30.469 --> 24:31.600
No.

24:31.644 --> 24:37.563
But he was a vampire.

24:37.606 --> 24:41.088
He was turned back
by Vanessa Van Helsing.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.307
I've heard of her.

24:43.351 --> 24:47.311
Thought maybe it was
just a hopeful legend.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.096
No, she's real.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.446
There's something special
in her DNA.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.927
It can reverse vampirism.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.015
Tell me how.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.059
I don't know.

24:56.103 --> 24:58.105
But I can help you find answers.

24:58.148 --> 24:59.976
We both could.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.245
Would you back off, lady?

25:08.289 --> 25:10.596
I ain't a freak show.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.948
Don't you see what he is?

25:14.991 --> 25:15.775
A mutant.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.254
[annoyed]
Hey.

25:17.298 --> 25:19.735
A solution.

25:19.779 --> 25:23.217
If I can replicate what's
flowing through his veins,

25:23.260 --> 25:26.089
make a serum that would allow
regular humans to gain

25:26.133 --> 25:30.659
this vampire resistance,
this rapid self-healing...

25:30.703 --> 25:32.356
...We could make
ourselves immune.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.141
And the tide would turn.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.447
We'd regain the upper hand,

25:36.491 --> 25:40.321
and this nightmare would come
to an end once and for all.

25:40.364 --> 25:43.019
And is this something only
you can figure out?

25:43.063 --> 25:49.635
Well, with the right motivation,
she's capable of anything.

26:04.519 --> 26:05.346
[sighs]

26:05.389 --> 26:06.260
There's no sign of them.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.479
We're safe for now.

26:08.523 --> 26:09.959
Too modern?

26:10.003 --> 26:12.222
No. It suits you.

26:16.966 --> 26:25.540
More than 100 years, trapped,
neither dead nor alive,

26:25.584 --> 26:30.240
while the world unfolded
and fell to pieces.

26:30.284 --> 26:39.641
My husband, my daughter,
lived and died without me.

26:39.685 --> 26:44.646
I never got the chance to...
to know my own child.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.867
I think she was my
great-grandmother.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.347
Her strength passed on.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.654
Your strength.

26:52.698 --> 26:59.661
So you are my...
great, great granddaughter?

26:59.705 --> 27:00.967
Vanessa.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.664
Vanessa.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.711
My mother's name.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.409
She was a veritable force
of nature.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.063
[laughs]

27:11.804 --> 27:19.855
My family and I, our family, we
hunted all the powerful elders.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.552
Imprisoned the ones
that we found.

27:21.596 --> 27:25.078
Their power was thought
to be vanquished.

27:25.121 --> 27:30.605
And yet, this world outside,
that hellish thing in the maze?

27:30.649 --> 27:34.565
Sam, or whatever he's become.

27:34.609 --> 27:38.744
The fourth elder.

27:38.787 --> 27:41.616
Did you play a role in this?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.313
I destroyed them all.

27:43.357 --> 27:47.274
Abadon, Gabah, even Jacob.

27:47.317 --> 27:48.623
Why?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.016
Why would you do that?

27:50.059 --> 27:51.539
Because I wanted to.

27:51.582 --> 27:54.542
I wanted to raise
the Dark One to kill it.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.718
How?

27:56.762 --> 27:59.242
With what knowledge
that you could succeed?

27:59.286 --> 28:01.592
I wasn't raised like you.

28:01.636 --> 28:06.162
Aware of what I was,
my role in all this.

28:06.206 --> 28:06.989
I learned.

28:07.033 --> 28:10.906
I adapted.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.386
I made mistakes.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.562
How could you be
so headstrong?

28:14.605 --> 28:16.520
So reckless?

28:16.564 --> 28:20.394
Do you understand the gravity
of what you've done?

28:20.437 --> 28:22.962
The oracle and the fourth elder
are on the path now

28:23.005 --> 28:30.317
to freeing the Dark One,
and it's because of you.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.799
Then help me stop them.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.108
You said they needed this.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.588
For a ritual.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.111
There are pages in a book...

28:42.155 --> 28:43.069
The Van Helsing book.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.331
Yes.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.593
Do you have it?

28:45.636 --> 28:47.682
It's safe.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.467
I can take you to it.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.039
Well played.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.649
But I want to make something
crystal clear.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.564
As much as you want to cozy up
to Avery,

29:00.608 --> 29:02.349
I'm still the gatekeeper.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.699
So we're prisoners here
until I get results?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.353
Cooperate, prove
yourself useful,

29:06.396 --> 29:09.051
and you'll find your stay here
much more comfortable.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.792
Look, the kind of work
you want me to do-

29:10.836 --> 29:12.228
I... I'll give you a full lab.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.448
Better than you've ever had,
even before the rising.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.102
You can give me the whole CDC,

29:16.145 --> 29:17.756
what I promised her
was a fantasy.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.062
No, what you gave her
was hope.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.891
Surely the data that you got in
Denver from that gene sequencer

29:22.935 --> 29:25.241
will get you one step closer
to the answers.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.156
Like I said, what data?

29:27.200 --> 29:29.637
Remind me to never play poker
with you, Sarah.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.899
Why would I do that?

29:30.943 --> 29:33.902
Even fools know the house holds
all the cards.

29:33.946 --> 29:34.990
What about my friend?

29:35.034 --> 29:36.775
Your frie...

29:36.818 --> 29:39.952
Oh, don't be so sentimental.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.301
Come here.

29:42.650 --> 29:45.871
Use him as you need to.

29:45.914 --> 29:50.223
Doc, Doc, I ain't... I ain't
nobody's lab rat.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.355
Doc!

29:52.399 --> 29:54.401
Doc!

29:56.316 --> 29:57.099
[grunts]

29:57.143 --> 29:59.449
Back down! Back down!

29:59.493 --> 30:03.714
[grunts]

30:12.506 --> 30:14.073
Oh, wow.

30:16.466 --> 30:19.948
[grunts]

30:19.992 --> 30:21.254
[gun clicks]

30:24.561 --> 30:25.911
I have got the shot.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.216
Stand down.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.044
All of you.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.654
You're well-trained.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.787
Fearless.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.180
Lethal.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.138
And you're an asshole.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.444
Thank you.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.011
I was going to have her
cut you up into pieces,

30:39.054 --> 30:43.319
but instead I think I have
a better use for you first.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.937
Are you certain?

30:51.980 --> 30:54.809
Something this important

30:54.853 --> 30:56.550
I wasn't going to leave
on that island

30:56.593 --> 30:59.640
or take to Renfield House.

30:59.683 --> 31:00.728
Safe and sound, see.

31:00.771 --> 31:01.860
That's good.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.252
Give it to me.

31:07.387 --> 31:10.520
Wow.

31:10.564 --> 31:15.612
A great deal has been added
since I last laid eyes upon it.

31:15.656 --> 31:19.529
Your daughter, and
eventually my mother,

31:19.573 --> 31:24.708
it passed through
both their hands.

31:24.752 --> 31:28.712
To understand what's at stake,
you must know about the ritual.

31:28.756 --> 31:29.975
You'll have to cut me.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.890
Van Helsing blood reveals
the ink.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.021
I know.

31:33.065 --> 31:33.892
How?

31:33.935 --> 31:36.372
Your mother?

31:36.416 --> 31:37.939
No.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.942
We discovered it ourselves.

31:40.986 --> 31:44.293
Me and my sister.

31:44.337 --> 31:47.601
She gave her life for yours,
didn't she?

31:49.777 --> 31:51.822
Oh, Vanessa.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.389
It's what we do.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.609
We Van Helsings.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.393
We protect each other.

31:57.437 --> 32:00.135
Keep the family legacy alive.

32:00.179 --> 32:01.745
There's no guilt in it.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.966
Still, everything I've done,
all the people who have died.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.750
There's still hope.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.928
Let me show you.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.233
No. Let me.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.974
I heal, remember?

32:13.018 --> 32:16.543
A curiosity I still
don't understand.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.246
[sighs]

32:24.943 --> 32:27.336
My grandfather
sketched these.

32:27.380 --> 32:31.601
It was he who sacrificed himself
to entomb the Dark One.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.647
He had a plan
for the rest of us,

32:33.690 --> 32:36.215
that much my grandmother
remembered.

32:36.258 --> 32:39.000
For years, she told me
that there were secrets

32:39.044 --> 32:41.742
I was too young
to be burdened with.

32:41.785 --> 32:46.486
By the time I was old enough,
her mind was... gone.

32:46.529 --> 32:50.011
She handed me the amulet
and said it was up to me now.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.491
What was up to you?

32:51.534 --> 32:53.014
I don't know.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.102
To use it.

32:54.146 --> 32:55.930
To destroy it.

32:55.974 --> 33:01.153
The truth was lost with her.

33:01.196 --> 33:04.199
Did it have anything to do
with killing the Dark One?

33:07.420 --> 33:09.030
What is this?

33:09.074 --> 33:12.599
I believe it is the ceremonial
place of Incarnar,

33:12.642 --> 33:14.731
the boundary between earth
and the shadow realm

33:14.775 --> 33:16.733
where the Dark One
was exiled.

33:16.777 --> 33:19.954
My grandfather told me
about these gates.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.348
The place he built beyond.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.828
And the amulet has something
to do with these ceremonies?

33:24.872 --> 33:26.874
I believe so.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.528
It must, or else...

33:28.571 --> 33:30.051
What?

33:30.095 --> 33:32.053
Why would grandfather?...

33:32.097 --> 33:33.098
[groans]

33:33.141 --> 33:34.490
What's wrong?

33:34.534 --> 33:39.582
I don't know, I just suddenly
feel quite faint.

33:39.626 --> 33:41.932
Might we rest a while?

33:47.634 --> 33:49.070
What's this about?

33:49.114 --> 33:51.377
I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.161
Yeah, a bullet
to the chest?

33:53.205 --> 33:54.206
That'll do it.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.382
Well, I'd like to make amends.

33:56.425 --> 33:59.385
I don't want you to think of
yourself as some test subject.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.690
[sarcastically]
That's reassuring.

34:00.734 --> 34:01.822
Oh, but wait.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.780
There's a catch, right?

34:03.824 --> 34:05.913
You're something quite unique.

34:05.956 --> 34:09.351
You can fight, you heal,
you're a formidable adversary,

34:09.395 --> 34:12.833
but perhaps there's something
even more.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.053
I ain't no thug.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.184
If you're looking for muscle,

34:16.228 --> 34:17.142
you can find yourself
another stooge.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.534
I didn't do it for the mob,

34:18.578 --> 34:21.015
and I sure as hell ain't going
to do it for you.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.410
I'm thinking of something
quite... different.

34:26.281 --> 34:29.023
The world is a dangerous place,

34:29.067 --> 34:32.113
and she's the most
precious thing I've ever had.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.811
I can't risk anything
happening to her.

34:34.855 --> 34:37.118
[dramatic music]

34:37.162 --> 34:39.599
[groaning]

34:39.642 --> 34:46.780
[fighting grunts]

34:54.309 --> 34:55.571
[fighting grunts]

34:56.616 --> 34:58.661
[fighting grunts]

35:21.858 --> 35:23.860
[screams]

35:27.777 --> 35:29.301
Who is she?

35:29.344 --> 35:31.346
My daughter.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.870
Violet.

35:33.914 --> 35:38.092
And you, Julius, are her
new sparring partner.

35:41.530 --> 35:44.316
-Oh, boy.
-Hmm-mmm.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.196
It's no use.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.415
What do you mean?

35:56.458 --> 35:58.417
Without the blood,
the amulet's pointless.

35:58.460 --> 35:59.983
One would think.

36:00.027 --> 36:01.507
Look at it again.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.167
How?

36:09.210 --> 36:11.386
Some dark enchantment.

36:11.430 --> 36:14.215
A mystery we could
never understand.

36:18.915 --> 36:19.916
[laughs]

36:19.960 --> 36:22.310
What is it?

36:22.354 --> 36:27.663
The elder Abadon, he sent me
into some altered state.

36:27.707 --> 36:32.842
I went back to Hong Kong
in the past.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.757
I was you.

36:35.497 --> 36:37.630
[laughs]

36:37.673 --> 36:39.284
What was it like?

36:39.327 --> 36:41.764
Being me?

36:41.808 --> 36:44.767
I learned a lot.

36:44.811 --> 36:47.379
About what we're up against,

36:47.422 --> 36:53.254
who you are,
and who I am.

36:53.298 --> 36:56.562
And who are you?

36:56.605 --> 37:01.567
There's a part of me
I've had to fight.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.917
A darkness.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.659
It called to me for a while.

37:06.702 --> 37:10.228
I almost gave in to it.

37:10.271 --> 37:15.276
Whatever happens, you must
never surrender to the darkness.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.497
Why would it call to you?

37:18.540 --> 37:21.587
I was bitten by Abadon.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.633
And you survived
without turning?

37:24.677 --> 37:27.767
How?

37:27.810 --> 37:31.336
The darkness consumed Jacob
after he was bitten.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.599
He became an elder.

37:33.642 --> 37:37.472
But... you're still human.

37:37.516 --> 37:41.563
I don't think I'm a true
Van Helsing like you.

37:41.607 --> 37:45.263
Somehow I was made with
the blood of the Dark One.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.873
How?

37:46.916 --> 37:48.004
Your mother?

37:48.048 --> 37:48.962
No.

37:49.005 --> 37:51.443
Not naturally.

37:51.486 --> 37:53.923
By some kind of science.

37:56.535 --> 38:00.495
I was an experiment.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.018
Who would do such a thing?

38:02.062 --> 38:03.672
Why?

38:06.849 --> 38:10.244
[snarling and growling]

38:12.072 --> 38:12.899
They found us.

38:12.942 --> 38:13.987
Stay here.

38:14.030 --> 38:14.901
[growling]

38:14.944 --> 38:15.771
[sword slicing]

38:16.381 --> 38:19.340
[snarling]

38:19.384 --> 38:21.081
[grunting]

38:21.124 --> 38:23.910
[snarling]

38:29.132 --> 38:31.570
[grunting]

38:37.967 --> 38:46.411
[grunts]

39:03.993 --> 39:04.994
[gasps]
Lily!

39:22.229 --> 39:23.361
Did it bite you?

39:23.404 --> 39:24.492
Uh, no.

39:24.536 --> 39:28.148
[laboured breathing]

39:28.191 --> 39:29.236
Okay. Just lie back.

39:29.279 --> 39:30.498
It's okay.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.590
[vomits]

39:39.333 --> 39:41.030
What happened to you just now?

39:41.074 --> 39:41.857
That vampire?

39:41.901 --> 39:43.119
Your eyes?

39:43.163 --> 39:44.686
You bit it.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.427
I told you I'm not like you.

39:46.471 --> 39:47.950
[gasping in pain]

39:47.994 --> 39:49.430
Lily.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.650
There's nothing that
can be done.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.826
[groans]

40:00.615 --> 40:01.442
[screams]

40:01.486 --> 40:02.487
What are you doing?

40:02.530 --> 40:04.314
It bites you,
you turn and heal.

40:04.358 --> 40:05.359
No!

40:05.403 --> 40:06.447
No, then I'll become
one of them.

40:06.491 --> 40:07.448
You saw what I can do.

40:07.492 --> 40:08.449
I'll change you back.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.319
No.

40:09.363 --> 40:10.146
No, no, no.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.583
I'll never turn!

40:11.626 --> 40:13.149
I'd rather die!

40:13.193 --> 40:15.804
Get that thing away
from me!

40:21.244 --> 40:22.811
It's my time.

40:25.988 --> 40:29.383
There's no way to find
our path now.

40:29.427 --> 40:33.387
No way to the gates and
the answers that lie there.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.301
No, Lily.

40:34.344 --> 40:35.998
Lily, how do I find the gates?

40:36.042 --> 40:38.218
What do I do with the amulet?

40:39.785 --> 40:42.614
The light has already faded
from your eyes.

40:42.657 --> 40:46.095
I swear to you, I can fight
the darkness.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.097
I can find the light.

[sighs]

40:50.578 --> 40:58.717

41:43.631 --> 41:48.331
I won't let them.

41:48.375 --> 41:51.378
The light isn't dead,

41:59.125 --> 42:00.953
I swear.
