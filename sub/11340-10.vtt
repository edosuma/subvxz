00:17.734 --> 00:19.168
What time is it?

00:21.087 --> 00:23.956
Late.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.907
Something happened.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.209
Not good, Tony.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.412
What? What's
going on, Jimmy?

00:30.463 --> 00:32.747
After the fight,
Ryan was bad.

00:32.799 --> 00:35.134
Ryan? What about Ryan?

00:35.218 --> 00:37.386
He felt sick, Tony.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.555
So I took him
to the hospital, you know?

00:39.606 --> 00:41.890
People, they started
screaming at me.

00:41.941 --> 00:45.144
They started yelling
at <i>me,</i> Tony.

00:45.228 --> 00:46.979
About Ryan?
Are they doing tests?

00:47.063 --> 00:48.864
Yeah, I think so.

00:48.931 --> 00:50.983
But, see, when I went outside,

00:51.067 --> 00:55.537
the, uh, screaming,
it didn't stop.

00:55.605 --> 00:56.655
Who was screaming?

00:56.740 --> 00:59.491
These crazy guys, man.
They were crazy.

00:59.576 --> 01:02.728
And I told them to leave me alone
and they wouldn't listen.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.129
They just wouldn't listen.

01:04.214 --> 01:06.281
And then I saw
all sorts of stuff.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.966
Stuff?
What kind of stuff?

01:08.051 --> 01:10.052
Like I saw my ma,

01:10.119 --> 01:12.805
then I saw my old man.

01:12.889 --> 01:15.557
And then...

01:15.625 --> 01:18.594
And then I saw
the dude at the fight.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.429
But when I looked up,

01:20.480 --> 01:23.298
you see, the lights,
they started spinning.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.794
Tony, it was like--
it was like God was

01:25.819 --> 01:26.968
reaching his hand down

01:26.969 --> 01:29.321
and he was trying
to take Ryan.

01:29.406 --> 01:31.106
Look, look, Jimmy,

01:31.157 --> 01:32.825
you're punchy, J.,
you know?

01:32.909 --> 01:34.610
Ryan's gonna be fine.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.829
You had a tough fight
tonight.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.497
You gotta sleep it off.

01:38.581 --> 01:40.115
You sure?

01:40.166 --> 01:42.534
In the morning
everything will be ok.

01:46.089 --> 01:48.340
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:48.425 --> 01:50.992
I'm gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.845
Thanks, Tony.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.213
All right.

02:29.382 --> 02:32.167
Jeez, I hope you're
training for something.

02:32.218 --> 02:35.003
Or are you just
doing sprints for fun?

02:35.054 --> 02:37.005
No, I'm, uh...

02:37.056 --> 02:40.008
I'm trying to do this
triathlon in February, so...

02:40.059 --> 02:42.544
Oh, yeah. The FBI one.
You're an agent.

02:42.595 --> 02:45.264
Yeah, it is the FBI one.

02:45.348 --> 02:47.048
I'm not supposed to ask
if you're an agent.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.551
I work for
the Justice Department.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.019
- Oh.
- Yeah.

02:51.070 --> 02:53.856
I've seen you doing laps
at the Y, too.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.692
And you're training
for surveillance?

02:56.743 --> 02:58.694
I am doing
an MS triathlon.

02:58.745 --> 03:02.614
It's in January, but I'm not in
as big a rush as you.

03:02.699 --> 03:04.783
Well, I just have
about 45 minutes a day,

03:04.868 --> 03:08.787
so, you know, between
work and home and--it's hard.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.122
How's your biking going?

03:10.206 --> 03:11.290
Oh, I don't know.

03:11.374 --> 03:12.791
My tires are inflated,
I think.

03:12.876 --> 03:14.743
Well, you know, I am not
the best cyclist,

03:14.794 --> 03:16.128
so I was gonna ride
this weekend,

03:16.212 --> 03:19.348
and I could use some tips,
if you're not busy.

03:19.415 --> 03:22.768
I...just don't know
my schedule.

03:22.852 --> 03:25.387
Yeah. Or we could just see each
other out here or at the pool sometime.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.140
But I should find out
in the next couple of days

03:27.165 --> 03:28.365
and I could call you.

03:28.641 --> 03:30.258
That'd be great.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.062
Um...I--I have a card
somewhere.

03:34.113 --> 03:35.314
Here.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.615
Um, yeah.

03:36.699 --> 03:39.568
If something changes.
It could be fun.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.871
Or at the least,
an adventure.

03:42.939 --> 03:46.375
So, uh, what made you think
I was an agent?

03:46.442 --> 03:48.160
I saw the suit.

03:48.244 --> 03:50.295
What else could you be?

03:52.799 --> 03:54.383
Bye.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.168
So, you're going, right?

03:56.252 --> 03:57.336
I don't know.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.837
Well, is she cute?

03:58.922 --> 04:00.839
Yes, she is, but I need to focus
on my training.

04:00.924 --> 04:02.341
I don't need to be
distracted.

04:02.425 --> 04:04.125
Yes, you should be
distracted.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.845
Distracted is good.
What's her name?

04:06.930 --> 04:08.463
- Beth.
- I like it.

04:08.514 --> 04:12.634
And you know what they say
about riding a bicycle.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.187
- Who's getting a bicycle?
- Nobody.

04:15.271 --> 04:16.355
Let's get started.

04:16.439 --> 04:18.574
Uh, yeah, ok. Um, so,

04:18.641 --> 04:21.944
two men were beaten
with a metal pipe

04:21.995 --> 04:23.612
in Philadelphia last night.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.814
Sam Eeks, 58, he was
in town on business.

04:25.882 --> 04:28.250
And then Bruce Thomas, 32.

04:28.317 --> 04:29.251
He worked--oh, God--

04:29.318 --> 04:31.036
he worked
at a suit shop nearby.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.320
It looks personal.

04:32.372 --> 04:35.156
There was evidence of
undoing at the crime scene.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.292
He sat them up
on crates.

04:37.343 --> 04:38.510
Demonstrating remorse.

04:38.595 --> 04:40.662
In 1976, George Geshwendt
cleaned up the crime scene

04:40.713 --> 04:42.097
and covered
all 6 victims' faces.

04:42.164 --> 04:43.382
Well, this guy
did the same thing.

04:43.466 --> 04:45.133
He even cleaned
the blood off their necks.

04:45.184 --> 04:46.718
Whichever it is,
this type of aggression,

04:46.803 --> 04:49.671
coupled with his loose grip on
reality, usually leads to more.

04:49.722 --> 04:50.907
Then we can't take
a chance that this guy's

04:50.932 --> 04:52.132
a one-hit wonder.

04:53.009 --> 04:54.843
Exactly. Which is why
we're headed to Philadelphia.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.361
Wheels up in 20.

Is Hotch dating?

05:49.075 --> 05:51.577
I don't know.

05:51.661 --> 05:53.913
You know, statistically,
widowed men start dating

05:53.997 --> 05:56.298
much faster than females,
but Hotch is refuting the data.

06:09.763 --> 06:11.680
He's standing there,
isn't he?

06:11.731 --> 06:13.182
Hello, Garcia.

06:13.233 --> 06:14.767
Hello. Someone
talk about the case.

06:14.835 --> 06:16.068
You know, if you look at
the severity of the crime,

06:16.153 --> 06:17.386
this guy have have been
experiencing

06:17.437 --> 06:18.737
a significant
break from reality.

06:18.822 --> 06:21.240
But he'd have to be pretty
cognizant to undo the crime.

06:21.324 --> 06:22.992
That can happen
with killing anxiety.

06:23.059 --> 06:24.745
At first the person
feels the rage that caused

06:24.770 --> 06:25.911
them to commit the violent act,

06:25.912 --> 06:27.913
and then they feel remorse.
For some, that remorse

06:27.998 --> 06:29.915
turns into desire
to do it again.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.251
Soldiers recovering from battle
often experience both emotions

06:32.335 --> 06:34.253
in rapid succession,
if not simultaneously.

06:34.337 --> 06:36.005
Garcia, make sure
that the M.E.'s reports

06:36.072 --> 06:37.256
are waiting for us
when we get there.

06:37.340 --> 06:38.507
Yes, sir, I've already
sent her an email.

06:38.575 --> 06:40.009
What was the relationship
of the victims?

06:40.076 --> 06:41.743
Local P.D. believes
they knew each other.

06:41.795 --> 06:43.596
That area is pretty
desolate at night,

06:43.680 --> 06:45.347
and Sam was carrying
takeout for two.

06:45.415 --> 06:47.183
They also died within
minutes of each other

06:47.250 --> 06:48.434
and they both had
defensive wounds.

06:48.518 --> 06:49.935
Usually two random guys

06:50.020 --> 06:51.387
don't fight the same
person to the death.

06:51.438 --> 06:53.622
Which means the unsub
is that much more skilled.

06:53.690 --> 06:55.057
How do you subdue
two men at once?

06:55.108 --> 06:56.225
Maybe he had a gun.

06:56.276 --> 06:57.426
So why not use it?

06:57.477 --> 06:59.395
He released more rage
with a pipe.

06:59.446 --> 07:01.397
So he hit one and then
quickly blitzed the other.

07:01.448 --> 07:02.531
Well, however he did it,

07:02.599 --> 07:04.200
our unsub
has to be pretty fit.

07:04.267 --> 07:06.435
These guys put up a fight.

07:13.460 --> 07:17.796
Oh, come on, Jimmy, ease up.
Ease up, man.

07:21.251 --> 07:24.887
Oh, come on, man,
what are you swinging at?

07:24.954 --> 07:27.723
Come in behind his jab.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.341
Jimmy, stop brawling.

07:29.426 --> 07:31.260
You want to brawl,
brawl with a target.

07:31.311 --> 07:32.645
Come on, go to the body.

07:42.322 --> 07:45.407
All right, time, time, time.

07:45.475 --> 07:48.644
What are you doing?
What you swingin' at, huh?

07:48.695 --> 07:50.646
Let you hands go.
You had the shot.

07:50.697 --> 07:54.199
What's the matter?
Come on. Let's call it a day.

07:54.284 --> 07:57.703
I'm sorry, Tony.
I keep thinking about my kid.

07:57.787 --> 07:59.705
Your kid's been sick
since he was crawling.

07:59.789 --> 08:01.090
What do the doctors say?

08:01.157 --> 08:02.708
They're running some tests.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.628
They've done that before.
They come up clean.

08:05.679 --> 08:07.713
Yeah.

08:07.797 --> 08:09.882
Hey, look, are you gonna
be ready tomorrow night?

08:09.966 --> 08:12.184
I mean, the Cannon
is gonna be gunning for you.

08:12.269 --> 08:13.886
Yeah, I'll be fine.

08:13.970 --> 08:15.554
Look, Tony,
I talked to Billie.

08:15.639 --> 08:18.807
She's got an MMA fight where she
thinks I can make 1,000 bucks.

08:18.858 --> 08:21.226
You know how I feel about
that knuckle-dragging crap.

08:21.311 --> 08:24.113
We haven't spent 9 years
together for nothing.

08:24.180 --> 08:25.230
Come on, Tony.

08:25.315 --> 08:27.232
Look, Jimmy,
you are a fighter.

08:27.317 --> 08:28.534
A real fighter.

08:28.618 --> 08:30.035
And when you're
lowering the boom

08:30.120 --> 08:31.186
on the Cannon
tomorrow night,

08:31.237 --> 08:33.655
remember
what I told you--

08:33.707 --> 08:36.241
great fighters
are made, not born.

08:36.326 --> 08:38.577
Come on.

08:51.091 --> 08:54.426
Damn.

09:03.186 --> 09:04.553
Check this out.

09:04.604 --> 09:07.323
The unsub blitz-attacked Sam
over in this area

09:07.390 --> 09:09.224
and then dragged him
back over there.

09:09.275 --> 09:13.228
That would explain why he was
able to subdue them both.

09:13.279 --> 09:16.315
As he cleans up Sam,
Bruce comes by.

09:16.383 --> 09:17.307
Well, it makes sense.

09:17.332 --> 09:18.932
There's no way he could
attack both of them

09:18.952 --> 09:21.704
and then drag them
back to that spot.

09:21.755 --> 09:24.406
This--this is rational
and organized.

09:24.457 --> 09:27.126
Our unsub didn't have
a psychotic break.

09:27.210 --> 09:29.378
He knew what he was doing.

09:29.429 --> 09:31.913
He had rage toward
both these victims.

09:31.965 --> 09:33.465
And remorse.

09:33.550 --> 09:35.017
Yeah, but how
are the two connected?

09:35.084 --> 09:37.753
I mean, it's a crappy alley.

09:37.804 --> 09:39.972
Nothing around here
is open at night.

09:44.477 --> 09:47.029
How about that?

09:47.096 --> 09:49.148
Hospital.

10:00.326 --> 10:01.710
Jimmy.

10:01.778 --> 10:04.580
Jimmy, wake up.

10:04.631 --> 10:06.915
Jimmy, get up.

10:06.966 --> 10:09.618
We gotta get him
to eat something.

10:12.505 --> 10:15.957
You know, you could
do better than that.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.294
I can't.

10:19.362 --> 10:21.930
You haven't eaten anything since
we brought you in here last night.

10:21.981 --> 10:26.068
You remember
what I told you.

10:26.135 --> 10:27.803
This one
is a right cross.

10:27.854 --> 10:28.804
Pshhh!

10:28.855 --> 10:30.606
And this one
an uppercut. Pshhh!

10:30.657 --> 10:35.794
And if we need to,
we'll knock it out again.

10:35.862 --> 10:37.979
How's it going, Ryan?

10:38.031 --> 10:40.482
My stomach hurts.

10:40.533 --> 10:43.985
I know. The medicine
will be kicking in anytime now.

10:44.037 --> 10:45.320
And so will the food.

10:45.371 --> 10:48.290
As soon as you eat it,
ok, baby?

10:48.341 --> 10:52.094
Can I have a moment
with the two of you?

10:52.161 --> 10:54.630
Yeah.

10:54.681 --> 10:57.499
Hey. When we get
back in here,

10:57.550 --> 11:00.385
I want to see that plat
empty, all right, buddy?

11:08.061 --> 11:10.446
What's up?
You run the tests?

11:10.513 --> 11:13.816
His abnormal cell count
is incredibly high.

11:13.867 --> 11:16.618
I'm afraid that Ryan's
leukemia is back.

11:16.686 --> 11:20.906
Well, uh, we'll give him
some chemo, try some radiation.

11:20.990 --> 11:23.692
He didn't respond to that before.
It just made him throw up.

11:23.743 --> 11:25.244
Then we'll give him
a different kind.

11:25.328 --> 11:26.912
What kind? There isn't
another kind.

11:26.996 --> 11:28.831
Look, I know you two
just divorced.

11:28.882 --> 11:31.199
But you need to be
on the same page for Ryan.

11:31.251 --> 11:33.034
What about a bone marrow
transplant?

11:33.086 --> 11:36.004
My neighbor's Uncle got one.
He's swimming in Puerto Rico now.

11:36.055 --> 11:39.374
That's a possibility, but there are
factors that we have to consider.

11:39.425 --> 11:41.760
Factors like what?
The insurance covers it, right?

11:41.845 --> 11:43.395
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.850
We'll run some more lab work
and then we'll discuss other options.

11:47.901 --> 11:49.735
Ok?

11:55.992 --> 11:59.995
This is about money, Pammy.
He's playing us.

12:00.062 --> 12:02.698
He's a doctor.
Why would he do that?

12:02.749 --> 12:05.784
Because he thinks
that we can't afford it.

12:05.869 --> 12:08.570
But we're getting Ryan
that transplant.

12:08.621 --> 12:11.456
I don't care
how much it costs.

12:14.511 --> 12:15.928
What do you got?

12:16.012 --> 12:18.764
He volunteered here, went to get
a snack around 11:00 last night.

12:18.848 --> 12:20.599
That's the same time
as the killings.

12:20.683 --> 12:22.668
He always went to the same
sub shop across the street.

12:22.735 --> 12:25.521
He'd cut through the alley to
get there. Anything on Sam?

12:25.588 --> 12:27.606
Garcia just spoke
with a co-worker.

12:27.690 --> 12:29.691
Turns out they come to Philly
one week a month

12:29.759 --> 12:31.693
and stay at a nearby hotel.

12:31.761 --> 12:34.179
That's who Sam
was getting dinner for.

12:34.247 --> 12:36.365
So these victims
weren't together.

12:36.432 --> 12:38.634
No. And if Bruce is a volunteer here,
then he's a good samaritan type

12:38.701 --> 12:41.703
and probably came upon the scene
and tried to intervene.

12:41.771 --> 12:43.622
Ok, so if
it wasn't personal,

12:43.706 --> 12:45.941
then the anger was
weighing on the unsub

12:45.992 --> 12:48.043
prior to the altercation.

12:48.110 --> 12:50.495
Then the question is,
what does that stem from?

12:58.805 --> 12:59.755
Hey.

12:59.806 --> 13:01.122
Hey, Jimmy.

13:04.811 --> 13:06.061
Whoa, Jimmy.

13:06.128 --> 13:08.897
Now, that's $1,500,
everything I got to my name.

13:08.965 --> 13:11.149
I need you to put it on me
for tomorrow night's fight.

13:11.234 --> 13:12.434
I can't do that.

13:12.485 --> 13:13.468
Sure you can.

13:13.519 --> 13:15.470
Ryan needs
a bone marrow transplant.

13:15.521 --> 13:16.939
Pam's insurance
ain't gonna cut it.

13:17.006 --> 13:18.440
Where'd you get this from?

13:18.491 --> 13:19.775
I hocked some stuff.

13:19.826 --> 13:21.159
I can beat the Cannon.

13:21.244 --> 13:22.911
You said it yourself.

13:22.979 --> 13:25.981
Jimmy. Jimmy,
I don't know--

13:26.032 --> 13:28.166
if you're not gonna do it, I'll go
over there and do it myself.

13:28.251 --> 13:31.370
Fine. But this isn't
for you. It's for Ryan.

13:35.592 --> 13:38.677
There's that punching bag
drinking.

13:40.013 --> 13:41.546
What did you just say?

13:41.631 --> 13:43.715
Hey. Don't waste it
on him.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.462
Yeah, you need lots of rest
if you're gonna get

13:45.487 --> 13:46.887
knocked out tomorrow.

13:49.839 --> 13:52.524
Do what I ask, please.

13:56.980 --> 13:59.398
I talked to the M.E.
it turns out Sam

13:59.482 --> 14:01.233
was hit with a pipe
about 10 times.

14:01.317 --> 14:02.734
Bruce
was beaten over 30.

14:02.819 --> 14:05.203
That's either adrenaline or an
extremely high endurance level.

14:05.288 --> 14:07.041
He had the remorse one
experiences from killing

14:07.066 --> 14:08.266
anxiety for both victims,

14:08.324 --> 14:09.992
but the increase in hits
on the second victim

14:10.043 --> 14:12.744
indicates that
he started to enjoy it.

14:12.829 --> 14:14.630
It could be overkill.

14:14.697 --> 14:17.198
But overkill usually means
a personal relationship.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.597
If the victims didn't know
each other,

14:18.622 --> 14:20.043
it's unlikely
the unsub knew them.

14:20.303 --> 14:22.304
So what would account for
this level of blood-letting?

14:22.371 --> 14:24.539
The primal rage could be
about the blood itself.

14:24.590 --> 14:28.209
If he's enjoying the killing,
then he's getting aroused by it

14:28.261 --> 14:29.261
and developing
a kind of blood lust.

14:29.345 --> 14:30.712
Then why hasn't he done it
again?

14:30.763 --> 14:32.881
Maybe he hasn't had the chance.

14:35.601 --> 14:36.768
Hey, I'll see you,
Frankie.

14:36.853 --> 14:39.604
So I'm the punching bag, huh?

14:39.689 --> 14:40.856
Hey!

14:40.907 --> 14:41.857
Uhh!

14:41.908 --> 14:43.558
You called me
a punching bag?

14:45.227 --> 14:47.829
Aah!

14:56.824 --> 14:59.075
Their skulls are cracked
completely open.

14:59.126 --> 15:01.127
Teeth on the ground.

15:01.212 --> 15:02.779
His blood lust is increasing.

15:02.830 --> 15:05.782
He didn't clean up this time.
His remorse is waning.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.134
This guy would have to be
in great shape to do this.

15:08.219 --> 15:10.587
But this type of strenuous
killing could result in fatigue,

15:10.638 --> 15:12.972
increase in appetite,
and disorientation.

15:13.057 --> 15:14.290
Like he ran
a marathon.

15:14.341 --> 15:16.643
For some it could also result
in convulsive episodes.

15:16.727 --> 15:17.811
Epilepsy?

15:17.895 --> 15:19.145
Sort of. Oftentimes
after you you kill,

15:19.230 --> 15:20.814
neurons in your brain misfire
and you become overstimulated,

15:20.898 --> 15:23.466
which causes you
to start seeing things.

15:44.255 --> 15:46.256
Hey, hey, Jimmy!

15:50.661 --> 15:52.662
Daddy!

15:53.664 --> 15:55.098
Jimmy.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.768
You all right?

15:58.836 --> 16:00.770
Yeah, I'm good.

16:00.838 --> 16:02.338
Whoa, maybe you ought
to sit down here.

16:02.389 --> 16:04.941
Whoa, whoa,
jeez, Jimmy, easy.

16:05.008 --> 16:07.610
Ho, ho. Hey, hey.

16:12.349 --> 16:17.153
Aah!

16:17.204 --> 16:18.750
You know what?

16:18.775 --> 16:21.197
I'm gonna get Monty
to step in for you.

16:21.242 --> 16:24.694
No, I put everything
on this. I gotta win.

16:24.745 --> 16:26.863
Yeah, but if you're not feeling
well, Jimmy, then you can't--

16:26.914 --> 16:28.030
I'm fine.

16:34.889 --> 16:36.806
All right.

16:54.058 --> 16:56.181
We're looking for
a physically fit white male

16:56.206 --> 16:57.606
in his 20s to early 30s.

16:57.611 --> 17:00.120
He's killing these men,
but he's not robbing

17:00.145 --> 17:01.345
or sexually assaulting them.

17:01.398 --> 17:04.666
Initially we saw that he was
experiencing killing anxiety,

17:04.734 --> 17:07.871
which led him to clean up the
bodies postmortem out of remorse.

17:07.922 --> 17:09.672
Now his remorse
has subsided,

17:09.740 --> 17:12.709
and he seems to be
experiencing blood lust.

17:18.115 --> 17:20.748
Blood lust means
the killer's aroused

17:20.749 --> 17:21.467
by the sight of blood.

17:21.468 --> 17:25.070
Upon seeing it, his body releases
adrenaline and dopamine,

17:25.138 --> 17:28.473
which is causing
the violence to escalate.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.543
The urge to become violent

17:30.611 --> 17:33.646
is so overwhelming that
he's pulverizing his victims

17:33.714 --> 17:36.482
to a point way beyond
what's needed to kill them.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.953
The force with which
he's doing this makes us

17:38.978 --> 17:40.178
think he's in shape.

17:41.455 --> 17:43.873
After killing, our unsub
is probably lying dormant,

17:43.941 --> 17:45.992
either recuperating
from physical exertion

17:46.076 --> 17:49.329
or possibly developing
aphasia and convulsive attacks.

17:49.413 --> 17:51.781
Based upon the rage
involved in these kills,

17:51.849 --> 17:54.150
we believe our unsub
is probably depressed

17:54.218 --> 17:56.553
or feels like life
is working against him.

18:04.428 --> 18:06.262
...Jimmy!

18:12.269 --> 18:15.238
Yes! Yes, dad, that's it!

18:28.452 --> 18:31.955
Consequently,
he'll put himself in situations

18:32.006 --> 18:34.457
where he can feel
the high from drawing blood,

18:34.508 --> 18:36.960
which he views as power
and control over his life.

19:04.204 --> 19:06.623
4...5...

19:06.690 --> 19:09.826
6...7...

19:09.877 --> 19:12.879
8...9...

19:12.963 --> 19:13.880
10!

19:13.964 --> 19:14.914
You're out!

19:21.722 --> 19:24.090
We did it! We did it!

19:24.174 --> 19:25.725
We did it!

19:31.015 --> 19:34.267
Yeah, you did it!
You did it! We did it!

19:38.689 --> 19:40.773
Was the violence
inflicted with a pipe?

19:40.858 --> 19:42.275
No. This was hand-made.

19:42.359 --> 19:44.060
And you know
what's interesting?

19:44.111 --> 19:46.946
There was severe damage
to the liver and kidneys.

19:47.031 --> 19:48.564
I mean,
look at the bloating.

19:48.615 --> 19:50.366
So he changed
his M.O.

19:50.417 --> 19:53.086
And increased his rage. He did
more damage with his hands

19:53.170 --> 19:54.737
than he did with a pipe.

19:54.788 --> 19:56.405
What about
the orbital bones?

19:56.457 --> 19:59.742
Shattered. Both victims'
eye sockets were broken.

19:59.793 --> 20:02.045
This guy's got
a hell of a left.

20:05.582 --> 20:06.966
Where's the money?

20:07.051 --> 20:09.302
I forgot to bet it.

20:11.855 --> 20:14.440
What the hell do you mean?
That money's for Ryan.

20:14.525 --> 20:16.776
Between training you and getting
ready for the fight,

20:16.860 --> 20:18.895
it slipped my mind.

20:18.946 --> 20:20.763
- Well, then I want it back.
- I don't have it on me.

20:20.814 --> 20:22.115
Well, then write me
a check.

20:22.199 --> 20:23.366
Do I look like a bank?

20:23.433 --> 20:25.284
Don't tell me this.

20:25.369 --> 20:26.769
Don't tell me this.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.204
Jimmy, I...

20:28.271 --> 20:30.073
Don't tell me this,
you son of a bitch!

20:30.124 --> 20:31.157
You bet against me,
didn't you?

20:31.241 --> 20:33.376
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

20:33.443 --> 20:34.961
You said
that I could beat him!

20:35.045 --> 20:38.664
You can, but I knew
you weren't feeling well.

20:48.308 --> 20:50.426
Oh, no.

20:51.645 --> 20:55.098
How many times, Tony?
How many times you scalp me?

20:55.149 --> 20:58.684
This was the first, Jimmy.
I swear.

20:58.769 --> 21:00.486
Yeah? Prove that.

21:00.571 --> 21:02.605
Come on, kid,
we're--we're family.

21:05.609 --> 21:07.693
Jimmy?

21:07.778 --> 21:10.747
Hey, Jimmy!

21:15.285 --> 21:18.287
We saw the bodies. All of
the victims have stress breaks

21:18.338 --> 21:20.206
in exactly the same places.

21:20.290 --> 21:22.625
That's consistent
with the kind of accuracy you get

21:22.676 --> 21:24.326
from years
of fight training.

21:24.378 --> 21:26.429
Fight training?
You think he's a boxer?

21:26.496 --> 21:29.498
It makes sense. A fighter would
have the endurance it takes

21:29.550 --> 21:32.334
to commit this kind of overkill
on this many people

21:32.386 --> 21:33.936
with a pipe
or with his hands.

21:34.004 --> 21:35.972
It would explain why
at the first crime scene

21:36.023 --> 21:38.558
he lined the bodies up
in the corner. It's like a ring.

21:38.642 --> 21:39.976
It makes sense
about the blood lust,

21:40.027 --> 21:41.677
but what triggered
the killings?

21:41.728 --> 21:44.680
Garcia, I need all the
information you can find me

21:44.731 --> 21:46.682
on the Philadelphia
boxing scene.

21:46.733 --> 21:48.684
Well, let's see.
There's "rocky" I through V.

21:48.735 --> 21:50.453
And let's not forget
about that last one.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.621
Penelope...

21:51.688 --> 21:53.022
Sorry. Kidding.

21:53.073 --> 21:54.824
Here we go. Real stuff.

21:54.875 --> 21:56.192
Uh, let's see.

21:56.243 --> 21:58.744
The city produced
such greats as Tyrone Everett

21:58.829 --> 22:01.008
and the late Joe Frazier,
who developed the Philly

22:01.033 --> 22:02.198
style of punching people.

22:02.199 --> 22:04.083
And then...
The sport took off

22:04.168 --> 22:06.586
to Atlantic City
and Vegas,

22:06.653 --> 22:09.338
which put a dent in
the Philadelphia scene,

22:09.389 --> 22:12.341
but it did not kill the city's
passion for the sport.

22:16.379 --> 22:18.514
I gotta speak
to Lou, please.

22:24.738 --> 22:27.940
Come on.
I gotta talk to him.

22:33.247 --> 22:35.364
- What's up?
- A lot of people gotta talk to me.

22:35.415 --> 22:37.366
You make it quick.

22:39.736 --> 22:43.873
How many times has my scumbag
trainer bet against me, huh?

22:43.924 --> 22:45.958
Once? Twice?

22:46.043 --> 22:48.427
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

22:48.512 --> 22:50.379
Just tell me.

22:50.430 --> 22:52.548
Been your whole career.

22:52.599 --> 22:55.801
Wise up, kid. How do you think
he got that Cadillac?

22:55.886 --> 22:58.354
You can't be
that punchy, Jimmy.

22:58.421 --> 23:00.923
You knew that.

23:00.974 --> 23:02.725
Everybody knew that.

23:08.398 --> 23:09.598
Aah!

23:14.208 --> 23:15.691
Both of them were
beaten to death.

23:15.743 --> 23:17.359
Looks as if he used
his hands again.

23:17.411 --> 23:20.029
He took valuables this time.
Gold jewelry, watches,

23:20.080 --> 23:22.364
and some cash from the safe.

23:22.416 --> 23:24.333
Apparently this guy's
a bookie, too.

23:24.385 --> 23:27.203
A guy named Tony Cole lost
$3,000 in a fight last night.

23:27.254 --> 23:28.971
What was the amount
of his usual bet?

23:29.039 --> 23:31.207
No more than $500.

23:31.258 --> 23:33.593
I'm gonna call Garcia.

23:33.677 --> 23:36.464
Penelope, how's the greatest
computer tech

23:36.489 --> 23:37.597
this side of the Mississippi?

23:37.598 --> 23:39.732
Floats like a butterfly,
stings like a bee,

23:39.817 --> 23:41.984
Garcia's gonna find
what only her screens can see.

23:42.052 --> 23:43.186
What do you need, baby?

23:43.237 --> 23:45.271
411 on a Tony Cole.

23:45.355 --> 23:46.856
Ok, let's see.

23:46.907 --> 23:51.160
Tony was a middleweight star
back in the eighties.

23:51.228 --> 23:54.563
And then he was in a really
bad lawn-mowing accident.

23:54.615 --> 23:57.283
And that laid him up for a few months
and he had to throw in the towel.

23:57.367 --> 23:59.068
What's he doing now?

23:59.119 --> 24:01.204
He is a trainer at a local
South Philly boxing gym.

24:01.255 --> 24:03.172
Fits the profile. He probably
has embedded anger

24:03.240 --> 24:04.590
for not succeeding
in the sport.

24:04.675 --> 24:06.676
Yeah, but why change
his M.O. and start stealing stuff?

24:06.743 --> 24:09.045
The theft feels like
an afterthought.

24:09.096 --> 24:11.898
Something changed in his life
and he's desperate for money.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.967
Jimmy, I've been
trying to call you.

24:15.035 --> 24:16.202
Where's his doctor?

24:16.270 --> 24:17.837
I haven't seen him,
but we've got to talk.

24:17.905 --> 24:20.189
- Hey, Dr. Surna.
- Jimmy, wait.

24:20.257 --> 24:22.725
Dr. Surna,
here it is.

24:22.776 --> 24:25.061
What is this for?

24:25.112 --> 24:27.230
Ryan's bone marrow
transplant.

24:27.281 --> 24:28.531
What are you talking about?

24:28.598 --> 24:30.566
You said he could get one
but we needed the money.

24:30.617 --> 24:31.767
I never said that,
Mr. Hall.

24:31.819 --> 24:32.735
Yeah, you did.

24:32.786 --> 24:34.187
Mr. Hall, I said
we needed to wait.

24:34.254 --> 24:36.873
Not because of the money but
because I needed to do more tests.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.941
- Didn't Pam tell you?
- I was trying.

24:38.992 --> 24:40.776
Trying to tell me what?

24:40.828 --> 24:42.444
Ryan's not strong enough
to get the chemo.

24:42.496 --> 24:45.381
This isn't for the chemo,
this is for the transplant.

24:45.448 --> 24:47.550
He needs the chemo to get
him ready for the transplant,

24:47.617 --> 24:49.769
but his body's too weak
to handle it.

24:49.837 --> 24:51.804
No, no.
He's a tough kid.

24:51.889 --> 24:53.389
I know he's a tough kid.

24:53.456 --> 24:58.010
Mr. Hall, the cancer cells
are multiplying too rapidly.

24:58.095 --> 24:59.312
Your son's not gonna make it.

24:59.396 --> 25:01.430
I know that
he is a tough kid,

25:01.482 --> 25:03.816
so when is he
gonna get out of here?

25:03.901 --> 25:07.136
Jimmy, are you listening?

25:07.187 --> 25:08.905
Ryan's dying.

25:08.972 --> 25:11.023
Ok?

25:11.108 --> 25:13.159
He's gonna die.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.449
If Tony is the unsub,

25:20.501 --> 25:23.202
why would he ransack
his own place?

25:23.287 --> 25:26.205
It was someone else,
but he knew him.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.673
There's no signs
of forced entry.

25:27.758 --> 25:30.659
Maybe someone knew
he robbed a bookie,

25:30.711 --> 25:32.828
so they came here
and robbed him.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.097
It doesn't look like
anything's been taken.

25:35.165 --> 25:36.299
The TV's still here.

25:36.350 --> 25:39.018
Except maybe Tony himself.

25:39.102 --> 25:42.522
Look at this damage.

25:42.606 --> 25:46.776
And the way this door jamb
is slightly torn from this side,

25:46.843 --> 25:49.395
as if someone
was holding on.

25:49.479 --> 25:52.315
If it was for retaliation,

25:52.366 --> 25:54.317
they would have killed
Tony right here.

25:54.368 --> 25:55.777
Maybe we got it wrong.

25:55.802 --> 25:58.013
Maybe Tony didn't kill
the bookie.

25:58.038 --> 25:59.488
Lou was a small-time thug

25:59.540 --> 26:01.824
and he would have
had lots of enemies.

26:01.875 --> 26:05.494
Who would have had
a motive to kill Lou

26:05.546 --> 26:06.996
and abduct Tony.

26:07.047 --> 26:09.665
The unsub could be
one of Tony's fighters.

26:09.716 --> 26:12.168
He'd definitely have the strength
to do both.

26:19.176 --> 26:21.761
Hey, Dad.

26:28.218 --> 26:30.152
How you feeling?

26:30.220 --> 26:32.572
I'm ok.

26:34.074 --> 26:37.193
You fighting tonight?

26:37.261 --> 26:39.228
I'm not sure.

26:41.582 --> 26:44.667
Whenever you box,
I feel better.

26:44.734 --> 26:47.837
Well, there might not be
another one for a while, buddy.

26:47.904 --> 26:49.905
What's going on?

26:49.957 --> 26:52.625
Everybody's
whispering today.

26:52.709 --> 26:54.576
Ma even came in here
crying.

26:57.547 --> 27:01.183
You know how she is.

27:06.223 --> 27:08.057
Am I gonna die?

27:09.610 --> 27:12.778
No. Don't even say it.

27:12.863 --> 27:15.865
Don't even say that.

27:15.932 --> 27:18.034
Remember what I told you?

27:23.407 --> 27:25.541
Right in the sickness' face.

27:25.608 --> 27:27.994
That's right.

27:28.078 --> 27:31.280
And that's why you're getting
the blood transfusion.

27:39.256 --> 27:41.557
Dad, I'm scared.

27:42.676 --> 27:44.960
Don't be scared, Ryan.
You're a fighter.

27:45.012 --> 27:46.562
Ok?

27:46.629 --> 27:48.764
I don't care
what anybody tells you.

27:48.815 --> 27:50.099
You're a fighter.

27:55.305 --> 27:57.356
Dad, you all right?

27:57.441 --> 27:58.974
Yeah.

28:00.944 --> 28:03.579
It's gonna be ok.
It's gonna be ok.

28:03.646 --> 28:05.031
You're gonna be fine.

28:06.867 --> 28:08.650
Where are you going?

28:08.702 --> 28:12.204
Tony's car broke down.
I gotta drop him off somewhere.

28:15.542 --> 28:17.710
Tony'll work with anyone,

28:17.794 --> 28:19.712
those coming up,
those going down.

28:19.796 --> 28:22.381
We'll need
a list of names.

28:22.466 --> 28:25.000
Tony train any tomato cans?

28:25.052 --> 28:27.970
Professional opponents.
Guys who lose all the time.

28:28.021 --> 28:30.306
He trained some cat
named Jimmy Hall.

28:30.357 --> 28:31.840
Guy's got the heart
of a fighter,

28:31.892 --> 28:33.859
but his technique's
all over the place.

28:33.944 --> 28:36.479
Jimmy Hall? Didn't he
win a fight last night?

28:36.530 --> 28:38.230
Hey, there's a first time
for everything.

28:38.315 --> 28:41.484
Why would Tony bet against his
own fighter? Isn't that illegal?

28:41.535 --> 28:43.786
Money's tight, sweetheart.

28:43.853 --> 28:46.122
Thank you.

28:47.407 --> 28:50.126
All right, so maybe Tony
assumed Jimmy was gonna lose

28:50.193 --> 28:52.861
and then he was stunned
when he actually won.

28:55.048 --> 28:57.633
Baby girl, I need a little
information on a local fighter.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.385
Guy named Jimmy Hall.

28:59.469 --> 29:01.670
Jimmy Hall. Ok.

29:01.722 --> 29:04.256
Oh, he has been hit
with some hard knocks.

29:04.324 --> 29:06.475
Grew up in the Kensington
section of Philadelphia

29:06.543 --> 29:08.177
in foster homes.

29:08.228 --> 29:10.096
Kicked out of 3 middle schools,

29:10.180 --> 29:12.515
one time for beating a kid
into a coma.

29:12.566 --> 29:14.316
So he's had
a violent streak.

29:14.384 --> 29:15.818
He dropped out of high school,
found his way to the ring,

29:15.885 --> 29:17.319
and doesn't have
much of a record, though.

29:17.387 --> 29:19.105
That's 'cause he was
never really a fighter.

29:19.189 --> 29:20.489
Do you think
this is sublimation?

29:20.557 --> 29:21.774
That's what it looks like.

29:21.858 --> 29:23.692
I've heard of killers
sublimating the need to hurt

29:23.744 --> 29:26.395
by becoming cops and soldiers,
but never boxers.

29:26.446 --> 29:28.831
This guy's no different.
He had a subconscious desire to kill,

29:28.898 --> 29:31.083
so he got himself into boxing
where he could do it legally.

29:31.168 --> 29:33.202
Yeah, but it still
doesn't explain the blood lust.

29:33.253 --> 29:35.371
If he's been a fighter, he's been
around blood his whole career.

29:35.422 --> 29:38.090
Well, it didn't affect him until
something triggered it 3 days ago.

29:38.175 --> 29:41.010
The guy snapped and
then became a serial killer.

29:41.077 --> 29:43.345
Garcia, send me Jimmy's address.
Thanks, mama.

29:43.413 --> 29:45.214
Yeah. Here you go.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.685
Jimmy.

29:49.752 --> 29:51.920
We need to talk.

29:53.106 --> 29:55.024
Come on, Jimmy, open up.

29:55.091 --> 29:57.143
This is our kid.

29:57.227 --> 29:58.727
Ma'am, step away
from the door.

29:58.779 --> 30:01.197
- Step away.
- What's going on?

30:01.264 --> 30:04.233
Jimmy Hall!

30:08.438 --> 30:12.041
Jim and I used to be married.
What is happening?

30:12.108 --> 30:13.325
Do you know where
your ex-husband is?

30:13.410 --> 30:14.827
What is going on?

30:14.911 --> 30:16.829
He may have been involved
in a killing.

30:16.913 --> 30:18.414
Jimmy? No way.

30:18.465 --> 30:21.050
There are two beds in there.
Does someone else stay here?

30:21.117 --> 30:23.335
My son, on weekends.
But he's sick now.

30:23.420 --> 30:25.221
Is your son
in county hospital?

30:25.288 --> 30:27.423
Yes. He was admitted
3 days ago.

30:27.474 --> 30:29.091
His leukemia's back.

30:29.142 --> 30:31.310
Did Jimmy get into a fight
after that happened?

30:31.394 --> 30:34.313
Yeah. He got into an argument
with some guys outside.

30:34.397 --> 30:35.681
How do you know that?

30:35.765 --> 30:37.233
It's probably what triggered
the killings.

30:37.300 --> 30:38.901
Have you seen Jimmy today?

30:38.968 --> 30:40.019
At the hospital.

30:40.103 --> 30:41.687
He tried to pay
for our son's

30:41.771 --> 30:43.405
bone marrow
transplant in cash,

30:43.473 --> 30:46.108
but it's too late for the operation.
Ryan's dying.

30:46.159 --> 30:49.195
Do you know where
Jimmy went after that?

30:49.279 --> 30:52.414
Sometimes when
Ryan's not feeling well,

30:52.482 --> 30:54.083
Jimmy gets in the ring.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.836
It helps Ryan
feel better.

30:56.920 --> 30:57.837
Oh, wait.

30:57.921 --> 30:59.338
What is it?

30:59.422 --> 31:01.040
He did say that
Tony's car broke down

31:01.107 --> 31:03.008
and he needed
to take him somewhere.

31:04.127 --> 31:05.711
Excuse me.

31:05.795 --> 31:07.880
It's the hospital.

31:07.964 --> 31:09.515
Hello?

31:09.599 --> 31:12.134
Jimmy's at his end game.
He's probably already abducted Tony.

31:12.185 --> 31:14.720
His desire for blood is most likely
increasing. What do you think he'll do?

31:14.804 --> 31:17.973
He'll put himself
into a position to see more.

31:18.024 --> 31:20.643
I'm so glad you called.

31:22.779 --> 31:26.315
What do you mean,
he's worse?

31:32.522 --> 31:35.207
You son of a bitch.

31:36.243 --> 31:38.210
No, Jimmy.

31:38.295 --> 31:39.545
You're like a son.

31:39.629 --> 31:41.080
You lied to me!

31:41.164 --> 31:42.081
Jimmy...

31:42.165 --> 31:46.719
I don't care
what anybody says.

31:46.803 --> 31:49.138
I always knew
you were a boxer.

31:49.205 --> 31:52.474
You remember
what I said?

31:52.542 --> 31:56.395
Boxers are made,
they're not born.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.898
Uhh!

31:58.982 --> 32:00.232
I got a kid!

32:00.317 --> 32:03.485
I got a kid, too, Jimmy!

32:03.553 --> 32:07.156
What about my family?

32:07.223 --> 32:11.610
What about my family,
Jimmy? Jimmy, please.

32:11.695 --> 32:13.362
Jimmy, I was gonna
give it back.

32:13.413 --> 32:15.531
Don't, Jimmy--

32:19.821 --> 32:21.104
We have cops
canvassing the area,

32:21.156 --> 32:23.407
checking every place
Jimmy and Tony ever went.

32:23.474 --> 32:24.942
We also put uniforms
outside the hospital,

32:24.993 --> 32:26.243
just in case Jimmy goes back
to see his son.

32:26.310 --> 32:27.911
Should we check
the boxing matches?

32:27.979 --> 32:30.531
Garcia, I need a list of
every middleweight fight

32:30.615 --> 32:32.082
in the Philadelphia
area tonight.

32:32.149 --> 32:33.667
Nothing on the docket,
friend.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.919
What about underground
fights or smokers?

32:35.987 --> 32:38.288
I'll see.

32:38.339 --> 32:40.340
Only one.
The other 3 are MMAs.

32:40.408 --> 32:42.009
Did Jimmy ever fight MMA?

32:42.093 --> 32:44.011
Nothing that's been
documented, no.

32:44.095 --> 32:46.346
Most old-school trainers
won't let you cross over.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.215
Well, if he got his trainer
out of the picture

32:48.299 --> 32:49.766
and he needs to see more blood,
he might try that tonight.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.518
It's just about the most
violent sport there is.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.020
Hey, I just sent you
the addresses.

32:53.104 --> 32:54.304
All right, let's go.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.611
Jimmy.

33:00.678 --> 33:02.112
You ready?

33:02.179 --> 33:04.898
Yeah, I'm almost there.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.618
You finally convinced Tony
to let you do this?

33:07.685 --> 33:10.487
I didn't give him
much of a choice.

33:10.538 --> 33:12.406
About time.

33:23.167 --> 33:26.420
Hey, we're looking for
a fighter, Jimmy Hall.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.589
He might have just signed up,
you know, last-minute thing.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.424
Unless he's got two boobs
he plans to tape down,

33:30.508 --> 33:31.708
he ain't fighting tonight.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.399
And in this corner,

33:39.484 --> 33:43.904
weighing in at 185 pounds,

33:43.988 --> 33:45.489
the New Jersey nightmare,

33:45.556 --> 33:49.076
the punishing Pete Dunkle!

33:49.160 --> 33:50.744
And in this corner,

33:50.828 --> 33:54.915
weighing in at 175 pounds,

33:54.999 --> 33:57.334
the South Philly Cyclone,

33:57.401 --> 34:00.337
Jimmy Hall!

34:02.624 --> 34:05.425
Hotch, we just left the gym
on second street.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.294
No sign of Jimmy. You?

34:07.378 --> 34:09.513
Morgan and JJ
struck out, too.

34:09.580 --> 34:13.100
He must be at Moody's.
We're almost there.

34:28.866 --> 34:33.003
Yes! Yes, dad, that's it!
That's it!

34:33.071 --> 34:35.938
Yes, go! I think that's it!

34:51.589 --> 34:53.540
Go, Dad! Go, Dad, that's it!

35:11.926 --> 35:13.309
Hold it!

35:14.812 --> 35:17.280
You all right?

35:23.487 --> 35:24.955
Ryan?

35:26.841 --> 35:29.993
Ryan?!

35:30.044 --> 35:31.962
Fight!

35:40.138 --> 35:42.105
He's here.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.038
What's he doing?

35:58.122 --> 35:59.990
Why isn't he tapping
the floor to end it?

36:00.041 --> 36:02.243
Because he wants to be
taken to the hospital

36:02.268 --> 36:03.768
so he can see his son.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.884
BP's 50 over 30.

36:10.968 --> 36:12.886
I need to see Ryan,
please.

36:13.234 --> 36:14.385
- I need to talk to him.
- Not now.

36:14.405 --> 36:16.139
Let's get him to trauma.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.734
Where's Dad?

36:27.819 --> 36:31.104
He'll be here, sweetie.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.356
You rest.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.250
How is he?

36:43.334 --> 36:45.202
He suffered severe blows
to the head

36:45.253 --> 36:46.837
and he lost a lot of blood.

36:46.904 --> 36:47.838
Can he talk?

36:47.905 --> 36:48.955
Yeah, but he's weak.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.591
- So make it quick.
- I will.

36:55.930 --> 36:57.580
Jimmy.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.634
I'm Agent Hotchner
with the FBI.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.686
I know what happened tonight.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.087
My son is here.
I gotta see him.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.639
We know that's why
you threw the fight.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.190
And we know you know
what's happening.

37:07.258 --> 37:09.693
Yeah, he's a fighter
and he's gonna make it.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.228
Jimmy, they've stopped
the transfusions.

37:11.279 --> 37:12.562
That doesn't mean anything.

37:12.613 --> 37:14.030
Listen to me.

37:14.098 --> 37:16.366
Ryan doesn't have
a lot of time left.

37:16.433 --> 37:18.735
And he's scared.

37:18.803 --> 37:20.403
He's not scared of dying.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.489
He's scared
of disappointing you.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.989
Trust me, any chance
he has of feeling

37:25.014 --> 37:26.314
some peace in this moment

37:26.360 --> 37:29.445
is gonna depend on what
you say to him right now.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.665
So go in there
and be his father.

37:31.749 --> 37:34.584
Not a fighter,
not a trainer.

37:34.635 --> 37:36.937
Right now Ryan needs his dad.

37:54.989 --> 37:57.691
Is that you, Dad?

37:59.810 --> 38:01.978
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

38:02.029 --> 38:04.814
What happened?

38:04.866 --> 38:08.034
My fight didn't go too well.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.339
Did you win?

38:15.259 --> 38:18.762
No, I got knocked out,
kiddo. I got knocked out.

38:18.829 --> 38:23.717
But...You always win.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.686
Well, I couldn't,
you know? I just couldn't.

38:37.615 --> 38:39.866
And when I was
in that ring

38:39.951 --> 38:41.618
getting punched
over and over again,

38:41.685 --> 38:45.622
I figured out something.

38:45.689 --> 38:49.376
Sometimes, I want to fight,

38:49.460 --> 38:52.028
but my body,
it keeps telling me to stop.

38:52.079 --> 38:54.381
And it doesn't matter
how hard I punch, it just--

38:54.465 --> 38:55.715
I can't do it.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.084
And, uh...

38:58.169 --> 39:01.538
And when that happens,
you know what I do?

39:02.590 --> 39:05.175
I let go, Ryan.

39:09.814 --> 39:12.399
And what I figured out is...

39:12.483 --> 39:16.269
letting go doesn't mean
that you're a quitter.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.072
It doesn't mean
that you lost.

39:19.156 --> 39:22.892
It just means that you realize
in that moment

39:22.944 --> 39:24.744
that's it's time
to let go

39:24.829 --> 39:26.580
and move on.

39:38.960 --> 39:44.297
So if it's time, Ryan,
it's all right.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.717
'Cause you fought
a hell of a fight.

39:47.768 --> 39:51.087
Your mother and I,
we both love you.

39:51.138 --> 39:55.425
Don't you ever forget that.

39:57.561 --> 40:01.798
I love you, too, Daddy.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.013

40:33.080 --> 40:36.816
"Some of us think
holding on makes us strong.

40:36.901 --> 40:40.820
But sometimes
it is letting go."

40:40.905 --> 40:42.322
Right.

40:44.808 --> 40:47.527
All right, thank you.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.112
So Jimmy didn't lie.

40:49.163 --> 40:52.666
Philadelphia P.D. just found
Tony's body in a warehouse.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.085
Great.

40:55.152 --> 40:58.955
So, is the doomsday
bike ride happening?

40:59.006 --> 41:01.207
Yes, it is.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.460
Tomorrow morning, 9:00.

41:03.511 --> 41:07.213
But, uh, I don't know.

41:07.298 --> 41:12.352
I'm pretty sure Haley wouldn't
want you to avoid moving on.

41:12.436 --> 41:15.105
I'm not avoiding
moving on.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.606
I'm just not sure.

41:16.673 --> 41:19.309
Not sure about what?
Going on a bike ride?

41:19.360 --> 41:21.978
Aaron, I know you think
it's too soon,

41:22.029 --> 41:24.781
but you're no good to anyone
when you're miserable.

41:24.848 --> 41:26.232
I'm not miserable.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.319
Ehh...Maybe slightly
uptight.

41:29.370 --> 41:31.654
All right, I'll give you
slightly uptight.

41:31.706 --> 41:37.026
If there's one thing
I learned from Carolyn's death,

41:37.078 --> 41:39.295
it's that life is short.

41:39.363 --> 41:41.697
And you deserve
to be happy.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.585
I know.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.505
Then have a good time.

41:48.556 --> 41:51.257
Thanks.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.428
So are your tires pumped?

41:55.513 --> 41:57.213
I hope so.

41:57.264 --> 41:58.932
So you haven't done
a lot of biking?

41:59.016 --> 42:00.550
No, not a ton.

42:00.601 --> 42:03.219
But you're gonna do
a triathlon?

42:03.270 --> 42:05.855
Go big or go home. That's
what my dad always says.

42:05.906 --> 42:07.657
Your dad sounds smart.

42:07.724 --> 42:09.275
He was.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.995
He passed away
a few months ago.

42:12.062 --> 42:14.080
I'm sorry.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.065
Is your mom still alive?

42:16.117 --> 42:19.452
Yeah. She's doing
a lot better.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.954
That's good.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.256
How are you doing?

42:24.842 --> 42:26.760
I'm hanging in there.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.265
So where are we going?

42:32.349 --> 42:35.418
Uh, I usually go up Connecticut
and through Rock Creek Park

42:35.469 --> 42:36.919
and then back down 16th,

42:36.971 --> 42:38.972
but we don't have to
do all that if you don't want to.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.857
No, let's do this.

42:40.924 --> 42:44.694
If we lose each other, we will meet
back at Dupont Circle for coffee.

42:44.761 --> 42:47.480
Lose each other? I thought we
were gonna do this together.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.649
The chase is part of it.
