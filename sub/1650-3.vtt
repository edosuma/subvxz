WEBVTT

00:11.012 --> 00:13.048
( helicopter whirring )

00:20.188 --> 00:23.305
Whiskey-1-2.
Whiskey-1-2, do you copy?

00:25.693 --> 00:29.356
Gonna 180, close the distance,
get back in contact.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.454
- ( engine sputters)
- ( beeping )

00:51.802 --> 00:53.542
Pilot:
Have faith, guys.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.882
I've got us through a lot worse
than some light turbulence.

00:56.057 --> 00:59.299
( explosion )

00:59.477 --> 01:01.217
- ( beeping )
- Pilot: Hold on!

01:01.395 --> 01:04.057
- Wellsey!
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!

01:07.735 --> 01:09.566
Crash positions!

01:09.737 --> 01:12.945
I'm putting her
down by the road.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.781
Come on.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.706
We're going in hard!

01:41.269 --> 01:44.102
(moaning)

02:04.917 --> 02:04.951
(theme music playing )

02:04.959 --> 02:06.915
(theme music playing )

02:51.630 --> 02:53.837
( panting )

02:55.384 --> 02:59.093
( vomits )

02:59.263 --> 03:02.346
- Don't push yourself.
-(coughs)

03:03.809 --> 03:05.891
You'd better sit.

03:28.501 --> 03:31.038
I'll check it out.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.248
(coughs)

03:38.969 --> 03:41.346
(snarling )

04:29.562 --> 04:31.098
Someone's coming.

04:31.272 --> 04:34.139
- Any survivors?
- Two dead, not sure about the other.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.708
Man:
Fan out.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.350
Save those rounds
until you need 'em.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.226
(snarling )

05:27.995 --> 05:30.156
( muffled cough )

05:36.587 --> 05:38.828
(snarling )

05:49.683 --> 05:51.298
(grunts)

05:54.021 --> 05:56.353
(growling)

05:56.524 --> 05:57.889
(grunts)

06:01.153 --> 06:03.360
Got a breather.
Tim!

06:13.123 --> 06:15.205
Help me out here.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.004
No.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.851
Over here, Shumpert.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.242
Drag him out.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.661
He's saving them.
We should show ourselves.

07:01.839 --> 07:04.376
Not yet.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.304
(moaning)

07:09.471 --> 07:13.339
(moaning)

07:13.517 --> 07:16.259
(moaning)

07:32.328 --> 07:34.410
( crunches )

07:51.096 --> 07:53.553
(snarling )

07:57.186 --> 07:59.643
( knife crunches )

08:02.358 --> 08:04.394
(muffled coughing)

08:28.592 --> 08:31.004
(thunder rumbles)

08:52.199 --> 08:53.700
Let's roll out.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.502
-( branch snaps)
- Man: Uh-uh-uh.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.506
Easy does it, girl.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.962
Mine's a whole lot
bigger than yours.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.423
Now put down your weapons.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.686
That's it.
Nice and easy.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.641
And let me see
yourhands.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.025
Now spin around.
That's it.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.311
Nice little twirl around.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.445
Oh, holy shit.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.235
Blondie.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.781
- Damn, you're looking good.
- ( walker snarling )

09:43.959 --> 09:45.995
(thunks)

09:52.593 --> 09:55.551
Now, how's about a big hug

09:55.721 --> 09:58.007
for your old pal Merle?

10:09.193 --> 10:10.979
Man: Have Stevens prep
the infirmary.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.189
- Man #2: How many?
- Three.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.070
One with multiple fractures
and severe burns.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.492
Another in and out
of consciousness,

10:17.659 --> 10:19.911
probably shock
and dehydration.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.569
- And the third?
- She's fine.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.285
- A female?
- Two.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.791
Found them hiding
in the woods.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.497
Bringing a homework
assignment for you,

10:29.671 --> 10:30.706
so open the lab.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.337
Man #2:
Do tell.

10:32.508 --> 10:33.873
Man: Be at the gates
in five minutes.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.086
Get off the radio.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.295
Man #2:
Well, what is it?

10:36.470 --> 10:38.301
Man:
Now, Milton.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.855
- Michonne?
- Right here.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.703
Shh.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.340
Hold that.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.131
Why are we being
held here?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.309
- We want to leave.
- You're not well enough.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.268
And it's dark.
You should stay the night.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.603
Where are we?

11:36.530 --> 11:39.693
That's not for me to say.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.858
- He'll talk to you.
- Who?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.411
( door opens)

11:43.579 --> 11:47.288
Go check on
your patient, Doc.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.039
Bet you was wondering
if I was real.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.872
Probably hoping
I wasn't.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.499
Well, here lam.

11:58.677 --> 11:59.883
( chuckles )

12:00.053 --> 12:01.589
I guess this old world
gets a little smaller

12:01.763 --> 12:02.969
toward the end, huh?

12:03.140 --> 12:06.724
Ain't so many of us left
to share the air, right?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.812
You know,
when they found me,

12:15.986 --> 12:17.647
l was near bled out.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.448
Starving.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.732
Thinking to myself a bullet

12:22.910 --> 12:26.277
might make a good last meal.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.743
Take myself
a nice long nap after.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.329
Wait for Daryl
on the other side.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.249
You seen my brother?

12:39.343 --> 12:41.800
Not for a long time.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.471
( chuckles )

12:43.639 --> 12:45.630
Makes two of us.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.264
He went back for you.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.096
Him and Rick.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.852
You were already gone.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.809
Well...
(laughs)

12:54.983 --> 12:56.939
not all of me.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.940
-( laughs)
- Oh, God.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.777
Yeah, Rick.

13:04.952 --> 13:09.161
He's that prick
that cuffed me to the rooftop.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.085
Yeah.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.664
He tried.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.544
Daryl saw that.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.837
He's always been the sweet one,
my baby brother.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.754
He wanted
to keep looking,

13:26.932 --> 13:29.594
but things happen.
People died.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.555
A lot of them.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.471
Jim, Dale,

13:35.649 --> 13:37.856
Jacqui, Sophia...

13:41.113 --> 13:42.728
Amy.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.816
Your sister?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.537
Yes.

13:51.957 --> 13:54.494
She was a good kid.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.628
I'm sorry to hear it.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.380
There were more.
A lot more.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.542
We had to leave Atlanta.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.961
We wound up on a farm.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.425
Daryl stepped up.

14:09.599 --> 14:13.512
Became a valued member
of the group.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.518
Now he's dead.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.055
I don't know that
for sure.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.815
We got run off
by a herd.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.352
How long ago?

14:23.530 --> 14:26.067
Seven, eight months.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.192
l was separated
from the rest of them.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.361
Got left behind.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.243
I know what it feels like.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.537
I doubt that.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.958
What do you want from us?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.770
Damn.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.727
There she sits,

15:01.902 --> 15:04.644
four walls around her,
roof over her head,

15:04.821 --> 15:06.436
medicine in her veins,

15:06.615 --> 15:09.482
and she wants to know
what I want from her.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.617
l plucked you and your mute here
out of the dirt, blondie.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.078
Saved your asses.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.789
How about a thank you?

15:21.963 --> 15:24.295
You had a gun on us.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.206
Ooh, she speaks.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.877
( laughs)

15:31.056 --> 15:35.174
Who ain't had a gun on 'em
in the past year, huh?

15:35.352 --> 15:36.512
Show of hands, y'all.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.597
Anybody?

15:38.772 --> 15:40.512
Hmm?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.601
Shumpert, Crowley.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.609
Y'all had a gun on y'all?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.440
( scoffs )
Hell...

15:47.614 --> 15:49.605
I think I'd piss my pants

15:49.783 --> 15:53.150
if some stranger come walking up
with his mitts in his pockets.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.035
That'd be the son of a bitch
you'd really want to be scared of.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.447
Thank you.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.052
(whispering )

16:22.691 --> 16:24.477
Sure thing.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.604
How you feeling?

16:27.779 --> 16:30.020
We want our weapons.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.734
Sure.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.990
On our way out
the front gates.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.992
Andrea:
Show us the way.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.404
You've kept us locked up
in this room.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.244
You see any bars
on the windows?

16:42.419 --> 16:44.000
You're being cared for.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.786
Under guard.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.295
To protect our people.
We don't know you.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.330
We know enough about you
to want out of this place.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.501
We watched you drive a knife
into the skulls of two dead men.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.180
What the hell was
that all about?

16:55.849 --> 16:56.964
They turned.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.007
They weren't bitten.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.229
Doesn't matter.

17:11.198 --> 17:14.031
However we die,
we all turn.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.863
I put them out
of their misery.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.792
It's not easy news
to swallow at first, but there it is.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.795
You're not prisoners here,
you're guests.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.752
If you want to leave,
as I said, you're free to do so.

17:31.927 --> 17:33.713
But we don't open
the gates past dusk.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.969
Draws too much attention.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.757
And you especially,
you need a solid night's sleep.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.847
You wouldn't last another day
out there in your condition.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.058
Have you brought over
to my place in the morning.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.439
Return your weapons.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.145
Extra ammo,
food for the road,

17:49.319 --> 17:51.310
some meds, keys to a vehicle
if you want one.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.068
Send you on your way.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.074
No hard feelings.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.956
Welcome to Woodbury.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.234
Come with me.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.688
Go relieve Pete
at the back gate.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.317
Take the spotlight.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.239
Are you military?

19:23.413 --> 19:25.995
Hardly.
Couple of vets,

19:26.166 --> 19:28.657
but by and large
we're self-trained.

19:28.835 --> 19:32.077
That's heavy artillery
they're packing.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.120
Some men arrive with guns,

19:34.299 --> 19:36.665
but most of the weapons
are scavenged over time.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.084
And the other side of town?
The rest of the streets?

19:39.262 --> 19:41.378
They're all guarded
like this?

19:45.769 --> 19:47.430
It can't be.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.720
It can

19:49.898 --> 19:51.183
and it is.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.189
( Merle whistles )

19:53.360 --> 19:54.941
Got us a creeper, Governor.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.070
May I?

20:00.700 --> 20:01.815
Thank you.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.405
Governor?
They call you that?

20:04.579 --> 20:07.537
Some nicknames stick
whether you want them to or not.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.870
Andrea: Buzz is a nickname.
Governor is a title.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.285
There's a difference.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.669
(gunshot)

20:14.839 --> 20:16.170
Merle:
Got him.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.297
He brought his buddies.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.341
( gunshots)

20:27.811 --> 20:30.177
Clear.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.767
We'll get them
in the morning.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.977
Can't leave them to rot.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.984
Creates an odor.
Makes people uneasy.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.941
What people?
There's nobody here.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.822
It's a ghost town.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.948
This way.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.335
You'll be more
comfortable here.

20:56.506 --> 20:59.418
Not the Four Seasons,
but there's a hot shower.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.924
Water's limited,
so keep it short.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.092
We got food, water,
fresh clothes.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.552
Hope this works.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.353
I know you'd feel better
with your sword,

21:18.528 --> 21:21.770
more secure,
but you're safe here.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.285
We appreciate it.

21:31.416 --> 21:34.783
What about the pilot?
Will he make it?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.701
Well, Dr. Stevens
is doing all she can.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.747
Now, I know you got a lot more
questions, but I got work to do.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.587
My man will be outside the door
if you need anything else.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.467
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.517
( people chatting )

22:00.695 --> 22:01.855
Andrea:
It's real.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.487
You two were out there
for a long time.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.443
While you were,
the Governor was doing this.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.485
Andrea: How many people
do you have here?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.323
73.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.490
Eileen's about to pop,
so her kid will make it 74.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.749
It's still
a work in progress,

22:16.920 --> 22:19.161
but Rome wasn't
built in a day.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.172
- That's a bold comparison.
- I think we've earned it.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.799
Walls haven't been breached
in well over a month.

22:24.969 --> 22:28.712
We haven't suffered a casualty
on the inside since early winter.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.505
Andrea:
How's that possible?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.890
Woman: Our Governor
set a strict curfew.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.801
Nobody out after dark.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.515
Noise and light are kept
to the bare minimum.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.849
Armed guards on the fence

22:38.024 --> 22:39.810
and patrolling the perimeter
to keep the biters away.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.236
I saw what your patrols do
on the way in last night.

22:42.403 --> 22:45.691
They had a dead one
strung up like an ornament.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.528
I won't make excuses,

22:49.702 --> 22:52.159
but those men put their lives
at risk every day

22:52.330 --> 22:53.490
to protect this town.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.530
They've lost more
than a few friends out there.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.245
Everybody copes
in their own way.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.790
But I'll raise it
with the Governor.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.553
Things were orderly.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.976
The fences held.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.758
People were protected.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.552
Food and supplies
were lasting.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.813
Then one of the men
inside got bit.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.066
Not sure how.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.227
He went haywire.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.361
Panic swept
through the camp.

23:27.532 --> 23:30.365
Someone opened the gate
to escape,

23:30.535 --> 23:33.402
others were bitten
and infected.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.571
Those people went crazy.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.364
The whole place went to hell
in a few hours.

23:38.543 --> 23:41.455
My team grabbed whatever
supplies and vehicles we could

23:41.629 --> 23:43.290
and abandoned our post.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.455
(coughs)

23:55.143 --> 23:57.099
How many of you escaped?

23:57.270 --> 23:59.977
There was 10 in my group.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.309
We got maybe 60 miles
from the post

24:02.483 --> 24:04.439
before getting jammed up
on the highway.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.603
I took the bird up in
the air to scout ahead.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.318
She took a beating in the riot,
but we had no choice.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.693
My guys?

24:17.624 --> 24:20.161
No.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.334
Let me go find the rest.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.123
Bring them here
where they'll be safe.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.294
They're out there
waiting for you

24:32.472 --> 24:34.633
exposed.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.644
Tell me where they are,
and I promise,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.268
if they're still alive,

24:41.439 --> 24:43.225
I'll bring 'em in.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.956
Did you finish
your homework?

25:10.134 --> 25:11.920
Unfortunately, the dog's
eating it already.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.006
What the hell you call me?

25:14.180 --> 25:17.843
Hey, where are we,
back in the school yard?

25:18.017 --> 25:21.180
What, you want to take his lunch
money while you're at it?

25:23.231 --> 25:25.347
Sorry, Governor.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.813
Maybe l've wasted
my time with you.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.147
Maybe you haven't learned
anything at all.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.153
- He was trying to smoke in here.
- And you, I expect better.

25:33.324 --> 25:36.111
Keep poking the bear
and you're bound to get mauled.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.197
Remember that.
Tell me about the girl.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.994
- Name's Andrea.
- You know her?

25:44.168 --> 25:46.454
She from that group
in Atlanta?

25:46.629 --> 25:47.994
Yeah.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.424
Same one left me
on the roof,

25:50.591 --> 25:52.968
forced me
to mutilate myself.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.212
Does she know
your brother Daryl?

25:57.390 --> 26:00.006
Yeah, she did.

26:04.397 --> 26:05.887
Then talk to her again.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.021
See what else
you can find out.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.612
Show me something.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.287
What do you make of it?

26:23.458 --> 26:26.245
Oh, pretty
impressive, really.

26:26.419 --> 26:29.752
Major kudos for ingenuity.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.628
Take away their arms
so they can't grab you.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.176
Take away theirjaws
so they can't bite you.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.595
Take away
their ability to eat,

26:36.763 --> 26:39.505
they lose interest
in doing so.

26:39.682 --> 26:40.888
They're no longer
in attack mode.

26:41.058 --> 26:44.186
We can be in their presence
without threat.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.686
They're-- they become
docile in a sense.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.017
Lu rkers.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.773
Mm, docile.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.101
Or lurkers.
You know, whatever you like.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.269
Why keep 'em?

26:55.448 --> 26:57.780
Ah, repellent.

27:01.329 --> 27:04.241
Camouflage.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.616
Walk with the biters,

27:08.795 --> 27:11.878
they think you're a biter.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.960
Low profile.
That's smart.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.293
They're still pretty thin.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.133
If they're not eating,
why don't they starve?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.672
They are starving.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.636
They just do it slower
than we do.

27:24.811 --> 27:28.395
Feels like we're trying
to impose logic on the chaos.

27:28.564 --> 27:29.940
That is not a bad thing.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.688
No, but what
does it buy us?

27:31.859 --> 27:33.645
More questions,
more theories,

27:33.820 --> 27:35.526
no answers.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.187
Not yet.

27:38.366 --> 27:41.233
If I could talk
to those women...

27:41.410 --> 27:43.025
Merle's handling it.

27:43.204 --> 27:46.116
(sighs) I don't want to question
yourjudgment, Governor.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.246
Sure, you do.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.159
That's why I need you.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.918
That and your tea.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.625
Ah.

27:54.799 --> 27:57.085
Well, then.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.677
With all due respect,

28:01.848 --> 28:04.009
letting Merle
talk to those women

28:04.183 --> 28:06.139
unsupervised
is a mistake.

28:06.310 --> 28:09.677
Now, you've always said
every tool kit needs a hammer,

28:09.856 --> 28:12.973
but do you really feel the hammer
is the right tool for that job?

28:20.032 --> 28:21.943
Eight months?

28:22.118 --> 28:24.484
Hard to believe you ladies lasted
so long out there.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.698
Because we're women?

28:26.873 --> 28:28.864
Because you were alone.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.123
We had each other.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.330
Two against the world.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.040
lt's long odds.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.829
We managed.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.841
- Oh, we're impressed.
- Very.

28:40.011 --> 28:42.798
Survival in the wild
is tough sledding.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.213
Wake up every morning
on the ground wondering

28:45.391 --> 28:47.052
if today is the day.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.433
Will it be quick and final

28:49.604 --> 28:52.266
or slow and, well,
without end?

28:52.440 --> 28:55.147
Will someone have the good
sense to kill my brain,

28:55.318 --> 28:57.354
or will I come back
as one of them?

28:57.528 --> 29:00.395
Do you think
they remember anything?

29:00.573 --> 29:02.313
The person they once were?

29:02.491 --> 29:04.152
I don't think about it.

29:08.956 --> 29:12.574
Milton believes there might be
a trace of the person they were

29:12.752 --> 29:14.663
still trapped inside.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.374
Like an echo.

29:17.548 --> 29:20.335
Surely it must
have crossed your mind.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.759
At one time, yeah.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.886
Right before
it tried to bite me.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.136
Milton:
And then you killed it?

29:29.310 --> 29:31.926
I say "it" only because
no one here

29:32.104 --> 29:34.390
likes to refer
to them as him...

29:36.609 --> 29:39.521
or her. Ahem.

29:42.073 --> 29:45.190
The two you had in chains,
who were they?

29:48.621 --> 29:51.033
The way you
controlled them,

29:51.207 --> 29:53.493
used them to your benefit.

29:53.668 --> 29:57.126
You did know them,
didn't you?

29:59.632 --> 30:00.872
Let them eat.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.962
My apologies.

30:06.973 --> 30:10.386
So what you have here,
you expect it to hold?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.847
What if a herd
comes through?

30:14.021 --> 30:15.636
It'll hold.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.313
What's your secret?

30:23.614 --> 30:25.150
Really big walls.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.780
( laughs)

30:26.951 --> 30:28.487
That soldier
had walls, too,

30:28.661 --> 30:31.949
and we all know
how that turned out.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.915
I guess we do.

30:39.547 --> 30:42.664
The real secret is what goes
on within these walls.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.007
It's about getting back
to who we were.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.839
Who we really are.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.847
They're just waiting
to be saved.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.508
People here have homes,
medical care,

30:53.686 --> 30:56.644
kids go to school,
adults have jobs to do.

30:56.814 --> 30:59.977
There's a sense of purpose.
We're a community.

31:00.151 --> 31:01.857
With a lot of guns
and ammunition.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.690
- Never hurts.
- And really big walls.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.981
And men willing to risk
everything to defend them.

31:08.159 --> 31:10.571
Compromise our safety,

31:10.745 --> 31:13.202
destroy our community,

31:13.372 --> 31:16.239
l'll die before
I'll let that happen.

31:29.680 --> 31:34.219
Looks like you're sitting pretty
at the end of the world.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.726
Do | strike you as the kind
of man who sits pretty?

31:37.897 --> 31:40.138
You reap what you sow.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.897
We're the seed.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.559
Now winter has passed,
it's time to harvest.

31:44.737 --> 31:47.194
Time to hope?

31:47.364 --> 31:50.856
We're going out there
and we're taking back what's ours.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.402
Civilization.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.822
We will rise again.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.584
Only this time we won't
be eating each other.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.684
To civilization, then.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.971
( knocking )

32:22.149 --> 32:24.606
Excuse me.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.356
How's the tea?

32:31.200 --> 32:33.532
(whispering )

32:37.915 --> 32:40.577
Sorry to cut breakfast short,
but this can't wait.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.616
We want our weapons.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.126
Well, we can make this
meal to go

32:44.296 --> 32:45.957
and your weapons
will be waiting outside,

32:46.132 --> 32:48.418
but you should
take time to relax.

32:48.592 --> 32:51.083
Get your strength back.

32:51.262 --> 32:54.220
Have a look around.
Who knows?

32:54.390 --> 32:56.506
You might like
what you see.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.650
I don't trust him.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.315
Why not?

33:16.662 --> 33:19.278
Have you ever
trusted anybody?

33:19.456 --> 33:21.583
Yeah.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.662
Then give this a day or two,
that's all I'm asking.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.668
Some time to get
our shit together.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.046
My shit never stopped
being together.

33:29.216 --> 33:32.174
Didn't look that way when Milton
asked about your walkers.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.676
I'm surprised he didn't
get a fork in his eye.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.337
It was none of his
damn business.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.016
I guess it's none
of mine, either.

33:41.187 --> 33:44.179
Seven months together,
all we've been through,

33:44.356 --> 33:47.018
I still feel like
I hardly know you.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.228
I'm sorry, it's the truth.
You know everything about me.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.692
You know enough.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.239
Those walkers were with us
all winter long,

33:59.413 --> 34:03.531
protecting us, and you took them
out without any hesitation.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.870
- That had--
- It was easier than you think.

34:32.196 --> 34:35.404
(car approaching )

34:35.574 --> 34:37.439
Vehicle approaching,
Corporal.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.032
All right, stay alert.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.214
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't shoot!

34:58.389 --> 35:00.004
Identify yourself.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.174
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
We found your guy.

35:03.352 --> 35:06.344
Wells.
Lieutenant Wells.

35:06.522 --> 35:09.184
His chopper went down.

35:09.358 --> 35:10.723
Where is he?

35:10.901 --> 35:13.483
We got a little settlement.
Now, he's badly hurt.

35:13.654 --> 35:15.110
But he's alive.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.647
The other guys didn't
make it, I'm sorry.

35:17.825 --> 35:20.942
But Wells, he told me
I would find you here.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.610
Wants me to bring
you to him.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.619
They found Wells.
They got him. They found him.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.951
We sure did.
We found you, too.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.458
(grunts)

35:29.628 --> 35:31.289
(gunfire)

35:49.815 --> 35:51.976
(gurgling)

36:07.458 --> 36:10.245
(grunts)

36:10.419 --> 36:12.831
( crunches )

36:13.005 --> 36:15.838
( panting )

36:27.978 --> 36:31.266
Never waste a bullet, son.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.806
Pick up the rest
of these weapons.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.485
Yes, sir.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.619
- ( gunshot)
- ( grunts)

36:54.254 --> 36:56.631
Go put a merciful end
to that young man's days.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.718
Let's see what Uncle Sam
brought us, shall we?

37:38.757 --> 37:41.294
(crowd murmuring)

38:12.249 --> 38:14.956
We brought in three
new people yesterday.

38:16.503 --> 38:19.791
One was a helicopter pilot
with a National Guard outfit.

38:21.842 --> 38:25.130
Eventhough
he's clinging to life,

38:25.304 --> 38:28.137
he told us about his convoy
on the highway,

38:28.307 --> 38:30.844
his men.

38:35.898 --> 38:39.982
I promised l'd bring
them back here alive.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.820
But they didn't
have our walls

38:45.991 --> 38:48.573
or our fences.

38:52.206 --> 38:54.492
Biters got there
before we did.

38:56.585 --> 38:59.418
Now, the men had trucks,
the trucks had weapons,

38:59.588 --> 39:02.500
food, medicine,
things we need.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.131
Now, we didn't know them,

39:05.302 --> 39:07.634
but we'll honor
their sacrifice

39:07.804 --> 39:10.841
by not taking what
we have here for granted.

39:11.016 --> 39:14.258
Won't be long before dark,
so go on home.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.393
Be thankful
for what you have.

39:19.942 --> 39:21.773
Watch out
for each other.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.955
You're still here.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.253
Anything I can do?

39:40.420 --> 39:42.502
No, nothing tonight.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.339
Long day?

39:46.510 --> 39:49.377
Haven't had many
short ones lately.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.341
Good night.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.589
So what's your real name?

39:54.768 --> 39:57.134
If it's not asking
too much.

40:01.984 --> 40:04.100
I never tell.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.436
Never say never.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.900
( chuckles )

40:17.207 --> 40:19.038
Neven

41:15.307 --> 41:18.845
(water bubbling)

42:22.999 --> 42:25.741
(theme music playing )
