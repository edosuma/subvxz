NOT NOW.

09:44.316 --> 09:45.550
- OH, YES, THEY CAN.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.184
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE
COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMEN

09:47.185 --> 09:49.487
BOTH THINK YOU LACK THE
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

09:49.488 --> 09:50.722

09:50.723 --> 09:52.357
- DID YOU SHOW THEM
THE CAGE ENCLOSURES?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.259
- IT'S INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.363
THOSE STRUCTURES COULD
HOUSE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:11.780 --> 10:13.247
THE PLACE IS VACANT.

10:13.248 --> 10:14.482
- VACANT?

10:14.483 --> 10:15.916
- LOOK, I COUNTED AT LEAST
50 PEOPLE WALKING AROUND

10:15.918 --> 10:17.652
WHEN I WAS UP THERE
THE OTHER DAY.

10:17.653 --> 10:20.522
- BUT THEY'RE NOT THERE NOW.

10:20.523 --> 10:23.124

DON'T UNDERSTAND.

UH, DID YOU GET THE COORDINATES

EVEN FROM TEN MILES UP.

10:29.032 --> 10:31.367
BOSS IS VERY PLEASED.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.303
- YEAH, WELL, HE'LL BE LESS
THAN PLEASED WHEN HE FINDS OUT

10:33.304 --> 10:34.438
THAT DRAKE'S BEEN USING
THE GROWTH HORMONE

10:34.439 --> 10:35.839
ON LIVING CREATURES.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.842
- WHAT IF SOMEONE TIPPED HIM
OFF ABOUT OUR INVESTIGATION?

10:38.843 --> 10:40.277
WOULD THEY PULL THE PLUG?

10:40.279 --> 10:42.447
- NO, NO, DRAKE'S GOT WAY TOO
MUCH TIME AND MONEY INVESTED

10:42.448 --> 10:44.816
IN THIS THING TO
JUST SHUT UP SHOP NOW.

10:44.817 --> 10:47.452
- SO WHERE DID
THE PEOPLE GO?

10:47.454 --> 10:48.253

WHERE YOU GOING?

11:01.636 --> 11:02.736
- I AM GOING FISHING.

11:02.737 --> 11:03.737

11:03.739 --> 11:04.605
YOU'RE A WORKAHOLIC.

11:04.606 --> 11:06.006

11:16.453 --> 11:18.320
- DUDE, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

11:18.321 --> 11:19.721

13:18.691 --> 13:19.891

15:33.905 --> 15:34.805
- I DON'T THINK SO.

15:34.806 --> 15:37.274
I-I'M JUST GLAD I MADE IT.

15:37.275 --> 15:39.009
- YOU DIDN'T.

15:39.009 --> 15:40.343
- WAIT-WAIT-WAIT.

15:43.347 --> 15:46.048
- ALL RIGHT, DRAKE SAID THE
FACILITY WAS THREE CLICKS

15:46.049 --> 15:47.517
IN FROM THE BEACH.

15:47.518 --> 15:49.852
MONROE, MARZDEN,
YOU ALL GO THAT WAY.

15:49.853 --> 15:52.255
LEARNER, PATTERSON, YOU ALL
CUT AROUND THE OTHER SIDE.

15:52.256 --> 15:53.689
WIDGE, YOU'RE WITH ME.

15:53.690 --> 15:56.092
REMEMBER WE
HAVE OUR ORDERS.

15:56.093 --> 15:58.328
NO WITNESSES.

16:17.748 --> 16:18.948
- FRANK, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

16:18.949 --> 16:19.849
- QUIET.

16:19.850 --> 16:21.351
- SOUNDS LIKE ONE
OF OUR REPTILES.

16:21.352 --> 16:22.485
BE READY TO ROCK AND ROLL.

16:22.486 --> 16:23.886
- ROGER THAT.

16:28.892 --> 16:29.992
- MAN, I DON'T KNOW IF I
COULD STOMACH SHOOTING

16:29.993 --> 16:31.427
CIVILIANS LIKE THAT.

16:31.428 --> 16:32.462
- DON'T THINK OF
IT AS CIVILIANS.

16:32.463 --> 16:34.430
THINK OF IT AS DOLLAR SIGNS.

16:34.431 --> 16:37.066
MONEY ALWAYS
EASES THE CONSCIENCE.

16:38.702 --> 16:40.770
- YOU REALLY BELIEVE
WE'RE HUNTING GIANT LIZARDS?

16:40.771 --> 16:42.572
- GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT.

16:42.572 --> 16:43.438
[growling]

16:43.439 --> 16:45.440
- WHAT WAS THAT?

16:46.709 --> 16:47.942
- OH.

16:49.745 --> 16:51.246
- AH!

16:52.415 --> 16:54.216
- PATTERSON,
LEARNER, WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:54.217 --> 16:56.251
PATTERSON, COME IN.

16:56.252 --> 16:57.686
MARZDEN, YOU NEAR THEM?

16:57.687 --> 16:58.253
- NEGATIVE.

16:58.254 --> 16:59.521
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

16:59.522 --> 17:00.922
- GET BACK TO THE RENDEZVOUS
POINT ON THE DOUBLE.

17:00.923 --> 17:03.659
- WE'RE HALF WAY THERE.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.327
- MOVE OUT.

17:08.198 --> 17:10.199
- MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

17:39.429 --> 17:40.161
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

17:40.162 --> 17:41.029
- YEAH.

17:41.030 --> 17:42.864
- THIS WAY.

17:50.639 --> 17:52.673
STOP PLAYING AND
START SHOOTING.

18:00.749 --> 18:01.716
THIS AIN'T DOING NOTHING.

18:01.717 --> 18:03.451
GIVE HIM THE C-4.

18:12.461 --> 18:13.494
GET DOWN.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.267
IT DIDN'T WORK.

18:19.268 --> 18:20.735
MOVE OUT.

18:28.943 --> 18:30.010
- DO YOU THINK WE LOST HIM?

18:30.011 --> 18:32.313
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:32.314 --> 18:34.081
BUT WE GETTING
OUTTA HERE RIGHT NOW.

18:34.082 --> 18:36.550
RADIO THE CHOPPER AND
TELL 'EM WE NEED EXTRACTION.

18:36.551 --> 18:38.185
- DRAKE TEAM XV1, COME IN.

18:38.186 --> 18:40.388
I SAID DRAKE
TEAM XV1, COME IN.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.371
- GENTLEMEN, IN TERMS OF
INVESTMENT, I ASSURE YOU

18:58.372 --> 19:03.443
YOUR MONEY IS SAFER WITH ME
THAN IT WOULD BE IN A BANK.

19:03.444 --> 19:04.977
- SORRY, MA'AM, THIS
IS A PRIVATE PARTY.

19:04.978 --> 19:05.912
- I HAVE AN INVITATION.

19:05.913 --> 19:07.113
- I HAVE TO SEE
WHAT INVITATION.

19:07.114 --> 19:07.980
- YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS

19:07.981 --> 19:09.148
TO GET YOUR HAND
OFF MY SHOULDER.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.116
- JUST SHOW ME
THE INVITATION.

19:10.117 --> 19:11.384
- ONE, TWO.

19:11.385 --> 19:12.519
- LOOK, LADY, JUST
SHOW ME THE INVITATION.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.687
- THREE.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.093
- EXCUSE ME.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.368
VERY SUBTLE.

19:28.369 --> 19:31.270
- YOU DON'T PAY
ME FOR SUBTLETY.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.039
- WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU WANT, VICTORIA?

19:33.040 --> 19:34.541
- WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.443
FRANK AND HIS MEN NEVER MADE IT
BACK TO THE EXTRACTION POINT.

19:36.444 --> 19:37.410
- OH.

19:37.411 --> 19:38.511
- AND THERE'S BEEN
NO RADIO CONTACT

19:38.512 --> 19:39.879
SINCE THEY TOUCHED
DOWN ON THE ISLAND.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.013
- DAMN.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.550
- SO, WE CALL IN MORE MARKS?

19:43.551 --> 19:47.487
- TELL YOU WHAT, VICTORIA,
WHEN I WAS A KID GROWING UP

19:47.488 --> 19:50.156
ON THE LOWER WEST SIDE
OF MANHATTAN THERE WAS

19:50.157 --> 19:54.227
THIS PIZZA JOINT ON THE CORNER
OF NINTH AVENUE AN 22nd STREET.

19:54.228 --> 19:56.763
A LITTLE MOM
AND POP PLACE.

19:56.763 --> 20:00.165
EVERY BOX THEY SENT OUT
HAD WRITTEN ON IT,

20:00.166 --> 20:04.903
"YOU'VE TRIED THE REST,
NOW TRY THE BEST."

20:04.904 --> 20:06.338
CALL THE CAJUN.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.840
- THE CAJUN?

20:07.841 --> 20:11.042
- THE CAJUN, IN MY ROLODEX.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.914
- LOGAN.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.416
- I'M LOOKING FOR A
MAN CALLED THE CAJUN.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.483
- YEAH, WELL, YOU GOT HIM.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.584
WHO'S THIS?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.286
- I'M CALLING IN
BEHALF OF MR. JASON DRAKE.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.821
I BELIEVE YOU
ALREADY KNOW HIM.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.490
- YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.299
WHAT DOES HE WANT ME
TO KILL THIS TIME?

21:19.010 --> 21:20.177
- IF YOU'RE CALLING TO
TELL ME TO PACK MY BAGS

21:20.178 --> 21:21.913
I HAVEN'T CAUGHT
MY QUOTA YET.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.514
- OH, YEAH, AND WHAT'S
YOUR QUOTA FOR TODAY?

21:23.515 --> 21:25.716
- I'D SETTLE
FOR AT LEAST ONE.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.117
BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHY YOU'RE CALLING,

21:27.118 --> 21:28.118
NOW IS IT?

21:28.119 --> 21:29.587
- IT'S NOT.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.489
LOOK, AFTER OUR CONVERSATION
THIS MORNING I'M THINKING AGAIN

21:31.490 --> 21:33.057
ABOUT WHAT I SAW
IN THOSE FIELDS.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.224
YEAH.

21:34.225 --> 21:35.760
I THINK DRAKE MIGHT
BE UP TO SOMETHING.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.061
- NO QUESTION.

21:37.062 --> 21:39.396
BUT, WHAT DID
YOU GO AND DO?

21:39.397 --> 21:40.998
SOMETHING...

21:40.999 --> 21:42.733
ILLEGAL, I ASSUME?

21:42.734 --> 21:43.768
- NOT REALLY.

21:43.769 --> 21:45.135
I DID GO OVER THE
COMMITTEES HEAD, THOUGH.

21:45.136 --> 21:46.437
I CALLED IN A FAVOR
FROM A BUDDY OF MINE

21:46.438 --> 21:47.538
OVER AT LANGLEY.

21:47.539 --> 21:48.473
- CIA?

21:48.474 --> 21:51.509
- TECHNICALLY NO,
BUT, YEAH, KINDA.

21:51.510 --> 21:52.409
HE HOOKED US UP.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.878
- HOW?

21:53.879 --> 21:55.746
- LET'S JUST SAY I HAD A DIRECT
FEED WHEN THE EYE IN THE SKY

21:55.747 --> 21:58.315
TOOK AN UNSCHEDULED
FLIGHT OVER THE ISLAND.

21:58.316 --> 21:59.249
- MARK, I LOVE YOU.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.351
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

22:00.352 --> 22:01.652
- WELL, YOU KNOW THOSE
CAGE ENCLOSURES

22:01.653 --> 22:02.720
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT?

22:02.721 --> 22:04.054
- YEAH.

22:04.055 --> 22:05.155
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
BROUGHT A DEMOLITION TEAM

22:05.156 --> 22:05.957
IN THERE.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.423
TOOK THE PLACE APART.

22:07.424 --> 22:09.626
THE, UH, EXTERIOR WALLS
HAVE GAPING HOLES IN 'EM.

22:09.627 --> 22:11.595
THERE'S RUBBLE ALL
OVER THE COURTYARD.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.597
THE PLACE IS A MESS.

22:13.598 --> 22:14.764
- DID YOU ALERT
THE COMMITTEE?

22:14.765 --> 22:15.699
- YEAH, I SHOWED
THEM THE PICTURES

22:15.700 --> 22:17.166
AS SOON AS
I GOT BACK.

22:17.167 --> 22:18.602
AND HERE'S THE THING-FIRST
THING THEY DID

22:18.603 --> 22:20.370
WAS CALL DRAKE.

22:20.371 --> 22:21.471
THE GUY HASN'T
CALLED HIM BACK

22:21.472 --> 22:22.639
AND HE'S BEING PRETTY
CAGEY ABOUT IT.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.074
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
ROBERTSON WANTS YOU

22:25.075 --> 22:26.943
TO STAY PUT.

22:26.944 --> 22:29.145
HE WANTS YOU TO
KEEP DIGGING.

22:29.146 --> 22:30.847
GO BUILD A CASE.

22:30.848 --> 22:31.982
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.

22:31.983 --> 22:33.683
GREAT, UM...

22:33.684 --> 22:35.018
I'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW, ALL RIGHT?

22:35.019 --> 22:36.252
- GOOD.

22:36.253 --> 22:37.921
GO CATCH SOMETHING BIG.

22:37.922 --> 22:40.100
- YEAH, SOMETHING
TELLS ME, I THINK I MIGHT.

22:42.101 --> 22:43.890
¶
[ Motor Sound Behind ]

23:14.300 --> 23:16.475
[ Motor Dying ]

23:23.383 --> 23:25.118
- COME ON.

24:07.815 --> 24:09.348
- AHOY.

24:09.351 --> 24:11.652
- HI.

24:11.656 --> 24:13.657
- HAVING SOME
ENGINE TROUBLE?

24:13.660 --> 24:16.696
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:16.701 --> 24:18.836
EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND
THEN THE BOAT ROCKED

24:18.839 --> 24:22.674
LIKE IN A STORM AND THE
MOTOR JUST KILLED.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.949
- LET'S GET YOU UP HERE
AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.

24:24.952 --> 24:26.018
- DON'T GO TO ANY TROUBLE.

24:26.021 --> 24:27.155
I ALWAYS CALL FOR A TOW.

24:27.157 --> 24:29.591
- IT'S NO TROUBLE.

24:29.595 --> 24:32.164
I DON'T MIND
GETTING MY HANDS DIRTY.

24:32.168 --> 24:33.635
I'M PAUL, BY THE WAY.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.606
- SWANSON, CASSIDY SWANSON.

24:40.186 --> 24:42.020
ARE YOU HERE ON VACATION?

24:42.023 --> 24:44.191
- MORE LIKE A SABBATICAL.

24:44.194 --> 24:45.594
MY BOSS HAS BEEN
WAITING A YEAR FOR ME

24:45.597 --> 24:47.131
TO COMPLETE SOME
IMPORTANT THEOREMS

24:47.134 --> 24:48.534
AND I GUESS HE
FIGURED THE BEST WAY

24:48.537 --> 24:50.972
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WAS TO
IMPRISON ME HERE IN PARADISE.

24:50.975 --> 24:52.810
- THEOREMS, YOU'RE
A SCIENTIST, HUH?

24:52.814 --> 24:55.481
- UH, AN ENGINEER, OF SORTS.

24:55.485 --> 24:57.520
- OF SORTS.

24:57.523 --> 24:59.590
SOUNDS VERY
MYSTERIOUS, PAUL.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.703
- I THINK I FOUND
YOUR PROBLEM.

25:04.706 --> 25:06.006
- WHAT?

25:06.008 --> 25:07.375
- OH, IT'S YOUR PROP.

25:07.378 --> 25:08.946
THE BLADES ARE BENT
STRAIGHT BACK TO THE HAUL.

25:08.949 --> 25:09.949
YOU HIT A ROCK
OR SOMETHING?

25:09.951 --> 25:11.451
- NOT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE RIVER.

25:11.454 --> 25:13.655
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING BACK
TO THE DOCKS IN THIS THING.

25:13.659 --> 25:15.260
I'VE GOT A JEEP.

25:15.262 --> 25:16.762
BE GLAD TO GIVE
YOU A LIFT.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.666
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

25:18.670 --> 25:20.804
- I'M PARKED JUST
UP THE TRAIL HERE.

25:28.893 --> 25:31.261
SO WHAT'S IT
LIKE BEING A COP?

25:31.265 --> 25:32.765
- MY DAD'S A COP.

25:32.767 --> 25:35.668
I'M A CONSERVATION OFFICER WITH
THE FISH AND GAME DEPARTMENT.

25:35.673 --> 25:37.674
- SOUNDS GLAMOROUS.

25:37.677 --> 25:39.478
SO, WHAT, UH, DROVE A
PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU

25:39.481 --> 25:40.882
INTO THAT LINE OF WORK?

25:40.885 --> 25:42.786
- SIMPLE, I LOVE ANIMALS.

25:42.789 --> 25:45.291
I HATE SEEING THEM
HURT OR EXPLOITED.

25:45.295 --> 25:48.096
SO WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE I
APPLIED AND GOT THE JOB.

25:48.101 --> 25:50.569
- MUST HAVE MADE
YOUR DAD HAPPY.

25:50.573 --> 25:53.375
- YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
NEVER MET MY FATHER.

25:53.379 --> 25:55.647
- A CONSERVATION
OFFICER, HUH?

25:55.651 --> 25:58.386
SO IF I, UH, EVER HUNT DOWN
ONE OF THESE WILD BOAR

25:58.390 --> 25:59.958
I SEE RUNNING AROUND?

25:59.961 --> 26:02.862
- I'D THROW YOU UP AGAINST
THE HOOD AND HANDCUFF YOU.

26:02.866 --> 26:05.634
- REALLY, IS THAT A
PROMISE OR A THREAT?

26:07.844 --> 26:10.212
- WATCH OUT!

26:11.085 --> 26:11.985
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

26:11.987 --> 26:14.088
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

26:17.366 --> 26:18.699
- I CAME DOWN THIS
ROAD TWO DAYS AGO.

26:18.701 --> 26:20.235
THIS MUST HAVE
JUST HAPPENED.

26:20.238 --> 26:21.238
- COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN A MUDSLIDE,

26:21.240 --> 26:22.707
HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH
RAIN FOR THAT.

26:22.710 --> 26:24.277
- HOW'D ALL THESE
ROCKS GET HERE THEN?

26:24.280 --> 26:27.383
[distant rumbling]

26:27.388 --> 26:29.022
WHAT WAS THAT, THUNDER?

26:29.024 --> 26:31.758
- NOT LIKE I'VE EVER HEARD.

26:31.763 --> 26:35.333
- I SUDDENLY FEEL THE NEED
TO BE AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE.

26:36.741 --> 26:37.674
- THERE'S ANOTHER WAY BACK

26:37.676 --> 26:38.809
THROUGH THE DRAKE
GAME PRESERVE.

26:38.811 --> 26:39.711
WE PASSED THE GATE
ABOUT TWO MILES BACK.

26:39.713 --> 26:40.980
BUT I THINK IT
WAS LOCKED.

26:40.983 --> 26:43.018
- WELL, WE'LL TRYING
UNLOCKING IT THEN.

26:43.021 --> 26:44.888
- THAT'S COMMONLY
CALLED TRESPASSING.

26:44.891 --> 26:46.325
- HEY, DESPERATE TIMES
CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES.

26:46.328 --> 26:48.029
COME ON, GET IN.

27:04.368 --> 27:05.802
- WHERE ARE THE GUYS?

27:05.804 --> 27:06.937
- I TRIED TO WAKE UP
KYLE, BUT HE WAS OUT.

27:06.940 --> 27:08.808
TOTALLY OUT.

27:08.811 --> 27:10.479
JOHNNY OPENED HIS EYES
LONG ENOUGH TO MUMBLE,

27:10.482 --> 27:12.116
"GO WITHOUT US."

27:12.119 --> 27:15.154
- DORKS, I KNEW WHEN THEY
STARTED DRINKING LAST NIGHT

27:15.158 --> 27:16.391
THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

27:16.394 --> 27:18.895
- I KNOW, SO DO
YOU WANNA CANCEL?

27:18.899 --> 27:21.135
- CANCEL A HELICOPTER
RIDE TO A LOST WATERFALL?

27:21.139 --> 27:22.405
NO, WAY.

27:22.407 --> 27:23.574
I'M GOING.

27:23.577 --> 27:26.246
- OKAY, I'LL GO CHECK
WITH THE FRONT DESK.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.551
HEY, MAYBE WE CAN GET A
REFUND ON THE GUYS FARE

27:28.554 --> 27:30.221
AND USE IT FOR
SHOPPING LATER.

27:30.224 --> 27:33.593
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
- OKAY.

27:42.185 --> 27:44.786
- TAKE A PICTURE
IT'LL LAST LONGER.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.224
- AM I BOTHERING YOU?

27:46.227 --> 27:49.663
- YES, YOU ARE.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.704
- IT'S JUST I THOUGHT
I RECOGNIZED YOU.

27:53.709 --> 27:57.011
- MY EYES ARE UP HERE, HONEY.

27:57.016 --> 27:59.851
- IT'S NOT THE
PART I RECOGNIZED.

27:59.856 --> 28:01.557
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A HIKE
BEFORE I CALL SECURITY

28:01.560 --> 28:03.361
AND HAVE YOU THROWN OUT.

28:03.364 --> 28:04.364
- HEY, THAT'S
NOT VERY FRIENDLY.

28:04.366 --> 28:06.767
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

28:07.673 --> 28:08.906
- CHICA, YOU'RE IN PARADISE.

28:08.909 --> 28:10.977
YOU GOTTA
LEARN TO CHILL.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.582
- HEY, PAL, YOU
NEED TO COOL OFF.

28:13.586 --> 28:16.221
- AH!

28:18.797 --> 28:22.066
- LADY SAID SHE
WASN'T INTERESTED.

28:26.915 --> 28:30.551
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY, MA'AM.

28:36.035 --> 28:38.604
- MR. LOGAN, SOMEONE FROM
MR. DRAKE'S OFFICE CALLED.

28:38.608 --> 28:42.477
THEY WANT YOU TO
MEET AT THIS LOCATION.

28:42.483 --> 28:44.050
- ANYTHING ELSE?

28:44.053 --> 28:45.887
- YES, THEY WANTED ME TO INFORM
THAT EVERYTHING'S READY

28:45.890 --> 28:47.792
FOR YOUR HUNTING EXPEDITION.

28:47.795 --> 28:50.630
- DO ME A FAVOR,
CALL 'EM BACK,

28:50.634 --> 28:52.768
TELL 'EM I'LL BE THERE
WITHIN AN HOUR.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.540
- WILL DO.

28:58.452 --> 28:59.485
POOL DESK.

28:59.487 --> 29:00.687
- JERRY.

29:00.689 --> 29:01.656
- THAT'S ME.

29:01.659 --> 29:03.860
- JERRY, IT'S ME,
CHAZ KINGSLEY.

29:03.863 --> 29:05.764
- IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR
VOICE AGAIN, MR. KINGSLEY.

29:05.767 --> 29:06.834
- GREAT TO HEAR
YOUR VOICE, TOO.

29:06.837 --> 29:08.036
BUT YOU'RE NOT ONLY
GONNA HEAR ME,

29:08.038 --> 29:09.439
YOU'RE GONNA SEE ME IN
LESS THAN FOUR HOURS.

29:09.442 --> 29:11.777
I'M CATCHING A STUDIO
JET TO THE ISLAND

29:11.781 --> 29:13.382
IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.485
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

29:14.487 --> 29:15.487
- IT IS WONDERFUL.

29:15.489 --> 29:17.089
I'M ALMOST AT THE
AIRPORT RIGHT NOW.

29:17.092 --> 29:19.727
JUST WRAPPED ANOTHER
SEQUEL TO "MANIAC MAN"

29:19.731 --> 29:23.267
AND DECIDED IT'S TIME FOR
A LITTLE RATED R AND R.

29:23.272 --> 29:24.806
- WELL, THE WEATHER'S
BEEN GREAT

29:24.809 --> 29:26.476
AND THE FISHING'S
TO DIE FOR.

29:26.479 --> 29:28.680
- YOU KNOW HOW I
LOVE MY TILAPIA.

29:28.684 --> 29:29.618
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:29.620 --> 29:31.921
I NEED TO ASK YOU
A VERY BIG FAVOR.

29:31.925 --> 29:33.025
- ANYTHING.

29:33.027 --> 29:34.961
- ANYTHING IS MY
FAVORITE WORD.

29:34.964 --> 29:37.265
NOW, I HAVE THE
PRIVATE VILLA, AS USUAL.

29:37.269 --> 29:39.337
BUT I NEED IT STOCKED
WITH EVERYTHING--

29:39.340 --> 29:43.043
FOOD, LIQUOR, CHEESES,
ALL BEFORE I GET THERE.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.516
- I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT HAPPENS, SIR.

29:44.519 --> 29:46.687
- GREAT, AND I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE WELL COMPENSATED

29:46.690 --> 29:48.357
FOR WHEN I SEE YOU.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.393
- NO PROBLEM, MR. KINGSLEY.

29:49.395 --> 29:50.162
- GREAT.

29:50.164 --> 29:50.964
OH, AND JER'.

29:50.966 --> 29:52.366
- YES?

29:52.369 --> 29:54.337
- MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH
FOR THREE IF YOU, UH,

29:54.340 --> 29:55.406
CATCH MY DRIFT.

29:55.409 --> 29:57.878
- THAT, I DO, SIR.

29:57.882 --> 30:00.183
HAVE A GREAT FLIGHT.

30:08.137 --> 30:15.176
- YOU KNOW IT'S MY SWORN
DUTY TO ARREST PEOPLE

30:15.185 --> 30:17.020
AND CRAZY AND YOU CAN SAY
APED MENTAL PATIENT.

30:17.023 --> 30:19.157
- THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN THE SHIRT.

30:19.161 --> 30:21.563
- I LIKE THIS SHIRT.

30:21.567 --> 30:24.368
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE IN.

30:24.372 --> 30:25.439
- WHERE'D YOU LEARN THAT?

30:25.441 --> 30:27.242
- OH, MY MISSPENT YOUTH.

30:27.246 --> 30:29.781
- FIGURES, I'M OUT
WITH A CONVICTED FELON.

30:29.785 --> 30:33.621
- HEY, I WAS
NEVER CONVICTED.

30:35.263 --> 30:37.297
WHAT?

30:37.301 --> 30:38.501
- NOTHING.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.471
I WAS JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE YOU OUT, IS ALL.

30:40.474 --> 30:41.407
- WHERE'S THERE
TO FIGURE OUT?

30:41.410 --> 30:42.978
I TOLD YOU, I'M
AN ENGINEER.

30:42.980 --> 30:45.414
COME ON.

31:16.419 --> 31:19.689
- OH, MY IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

31:31.586 --> 31:32.352
- OH!

31:32.354 --> 31:34.289
- JEEZ, YOU SCARED ME.

31:34.293 --> 31:37.162
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

31:37.166 --> 31:39.567
SAW THE HELICOPTER THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE THE SHERIFF.

31:39.571 --> 31:41.872
- SHERIFF, WHY WOULD YOU
NEED A SHERIFF UP HERE?

31:41.876 --> 31:43.310
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

31:43.312 --> 31:46.014
- NOTHING YOU GUYS NEED TO
WORRY YOUR LITTLE HEADS ABOUT.

31:48.591 --> 31:49.891
- WHAT'S THAT?

31:49.893 --> 31:51.293
- CAMERA.

31:51.296 --> 31:53.932
TRY TO KEEP IT
HIDDEN FROM THE WILDLIFE.

31:53.936 --> 31:57.371
A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR, UH,
"MOTHER NATURE MAGAZINE".

31:57.376 --> 31:59.745
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD
OF ME, REESE HAMMOND.

31:59.749 --> 32:02.083
- OH, HAVE YOU DONE
THOSE ANIMAL SHOWS ON CABLE?

32:02.087 --> 32:03.320
- I LOVE THOSE.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.190
- DID A FEW.

32:05.193 --> 32:06.627
- MUST BE FUN GOING
ALL OVER THE WORLD

32:06.630 --> 32:08.364
IN EXOTIC LOCATIONS.

32:08.367 --> 32:10.568
- IT HAS ITS MOMENTS.

32:12.911 --> 32:18.615
- SO, MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHOOT
US IN FRONT OF THE WATERFALL.

32:18.623 --> 32:20.858
- YEAH, I'M SURE, UH, IT'S
GONNA BE GREAT FOR MY EDITOR.

32:20.861 --> 32:22.962
NOT SO MUCH FOR THE
PRODUCERS, THOUGH.

32:22.966 --> 32:25.668
- AH, COME ON.

32:31.285 --> 32:34.086
- YOU CAN ALWAYS
CUT IT OUT LATER.

32:34.090 --> 32:35.691
- ONE ROLL.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.551
OKAY, YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA LOVE THIS PICTURE.

33:01.717 --> 33:03.785
- AH!

33:32.518 --> 33:33.885
- DO YOU THINK IT'S GONE?

33:33.887 --> 33:35.755
- I THINK SO.

33:38.798 --> 33:40.366
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

33:40.369 --> 33:41.702
THAT POOR GUY.

33:41.705 --> 33:44.841
HE WAS SO CUTE.

33:44.845 --> 33:47.046
- IT'S GONNA BE, "POOR US"
IF WE DON'T GET OUTTA HERE.

33:47.050 --> 33:48.985
- COME ON.

33:53.167 --> 33:54.334
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

33:54.336 --> 33:56.638
THE CHOPPER DOESN'T
GET BACK UNTIL FOUR.

33:56.641 --> 33:58.108
- I DON'T KNOW.

33:58.111 --> 33:59.778
WHICH WAY TO THE HOTEL?

33:59.780 --> 34:00.680
[growling]

34:00.682 --> 34:02.483
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

34:04.590 --> 34:06.658
- AH!

34:41.393 --> 34:42.661
- HOWDY, SHERI.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.864
- THANKS FOR COMING
SO QUICK, CHARLIE.

34:44.867 --> 34:47.268
- THAT'S YOUR TAX
DOLLARS AT WORK.

34:47.271 --> 34:48.973
SO WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM HERE?

34:48.976 --> 34:50.576
YOU WERE PRETTY
VAGUE ON THE PHONE.

34:50.578 --> 34:52.178
- BACK HERE, CHECK IT OUT.

35:04.805 --> 35:06.940
- OH, MY WORD.

35:06.943 --> 35:08.677
- FOUND HER LAYING LIKE THIS,
THIS MORNING WHEN I GOT BACK

35:08.680 --> 35:10.881
FROM FEEDING THE GRAIN.

35:10.884 --> 35:14.186
- ANY OF YOU SEE
ANYTHING, HEAR ANYTHING?

35:14.190 --> 35:17.292
- NOTHING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY, EXCEPT...

35:17.296 --> 35:19.931
- WELL, WHAT,
ROY, SPIT IT OUT.

35:19.935 --> 35:22.236
- WELL I WAS MENDING THE
FENCES ON THE BACK FORTY

35:22.239 --> 35:25.241
THIS MORNING AND SUDDENLY
THE WHOLE HEARD JUST GOT UP

35:25.244 --> 35:26.945
AND STAMPEDED
UP THE HILL.

35:26.948 --> 35:27.882
IF I HADN'T GOTTEN
OUT OF THE WAY

35:27.884 --> 35:29.584
THEY WOULD HAVE
RUN ME OVER.

35:29.587 --> 35:31.321
- WHO COULD HAVE
DONE THIS, SHERI?

35:31.323 --> 35:32.490
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
COULD HAVE DONE THIS,

35:32.492 --> 35:34.026
THIS IS A CATTLE MUTILATION
JUST LIKE YOU SEE

35:34.029 --> 35:35.730
ON THE U.F.O. SHOWS.

35:35.732 --> 35:37.599
- OH, CRAP, NOT THIS AGAIN.

35:37.602 --> 35:40.204
- I'M TELLING
YA, IT'S ALIENS.

35:40.207 --> 35:41.708
FIRST THEY GO
FOR OUR ANIMALS.

35:41.711 --> 35:44.245
THEN THEY GO
FOR OUR WOMEN.

35:44.248 --> 35:45.849
- I'VE SEEN YOUR WIFE.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.686
TRUST ME, ROY, SHE'S SAFE.

35:47.688 --> 35:52.458
LOOK HERE.

35:53.867 --> 35:56.102
THAT FLESH WAS TORN APART BY
WHAT LOOKS LIKE HUGE TEETH.

35:56.105 --> 35:57.404
IF E.T. DID IT,

35:57.406 --> 35:59.407
HE'S GOT ONE HELL
OF AN OVERBITE.

35:59.410 --> 36:01.045
- YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
TELL US WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL

36:01.048 --> 36:02.749
DID THIS TO HIM.

36:02.751 --> 36:05.685
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

36:07.226 --> 36:09.193
IT'S WHY I'M CALLING
CASSIDY RIGHT AWAY.

36:09.196 --> 36:12.132
IN THE MEANTIME, MAKE SURE
TO CALL THE OTHER RANCHERS,

36:12.136 --> 36:13.535
TELL THEM EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

36:13.537 --> 36:14.704
- WILL DO.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.942
- EXACTLY WHAT DID
HAPPEN HERE, SHERI?

36:19.416 --> 36:21.617
- WISH I KNEW.

36:32.741 --> 36:35.743
SWANSON TO LAUNCH,
SWANSON TO LAUNCH, COME IN.

36:37.350 --> 36:39.551
SWANSON TO LAUNCH,
CASSIDY, COME IN.

36:39.554 --> 36:41.422
SWANSON TO LAUNCH, COME IN.

36:42.995 --> 36:46.364
DAMN IT, DAUGHTER, WHERE THE
HELL ARE YOU WHEN I NEED YOU?

37:08.143 --> 37:09.543
SWANSON TO LAUNCH.

37:09.545 --> 37:13.983
SWANSON TO LAUNCH, FOR THE
TENTH TIME, CASSIDY, COME IN.

37:26.578 --> 37:31.283
- SO, PAUL THE ENGINEER, TELL
ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

37:31.288 --> 37:32.354
- NOT MUCH TO TELL, REALLY.

37:32.356 --> 37:35.591
I'M SORT OF BORING.

37:35.595 --> 37:38.197
- COME ON, OUT WITH IT.

37:38.201 --> 37:40.502
- JEEZ, IS THIS
AN INTERROGATION?

37:40.505 --> 37:43.741
SHOULDN'T YOU, UH, READ
ME MY RIGHTS OR SOMETHING?

37:45.682 --> 37:47.450
- STOP THE JEEP.

37:47.452 --> 37:48.385
- WHAT?

37:48.387 --> 37:50.888
- I SAID STOP THE JEEP.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.512
- WHERE YOU GOING?

38:02.514 --> 38:04.949
- BACK TO MY BOAT.

38:04.953 --> 38:07.088
YOU'VE BEEN LYING SINCE WE MET
AND I'M TIRED OF HEARING IT.

38:07.091 --> 38:08.124
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:08.126 --> 38:09.759
- I SAW THOSE
PHOTOS ON YOUR COMPUTER.

38:09.761 --> 38:12.063
SOME SORT OF SECRET
COMPLEX IN THE JUNGLE.

38:12.066 --> 38:15.702
YOU WANNA TELL ME
ABOUT THOSE, PAUL?

38:15.707 --> 38:17.008
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

38:17.010 --> 38:18.477
- CASSIDY, WAIT.

38:18.479 --> 38:19.778
- GRAB ME AGAIN AND I'LL PUT A
HOLE IN YOUR FAVORITE SHIRT.

38:19.780 --> 38:21.015
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

38:21.018 --> 38:22.784
LOOK, LOOK, I WORK FOR
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

38:22.786 --> 38:24.287
ALL RIGHT?

38:24.290 --> 38:25.690
I WORK FOR ECO-GROW.

38:25.692 --> 38:26.959
- NEVER HEARD OF 'EM.

38:26.961 --> 38:29.063
- IT'S AN OFFSHOOT OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

38:29.066 --> 38:31.034
WE OFFER ENDOWMENTS
TO PRIVATE INDUSTRIES.

38:31.037 --> 38:32.037
THAT'S HOW DRAKE
GOT HIMSELF

38:32.039 --> 38:33.539
THIS PRIME PIECE
OF REAL ESTATE.

38:33.541 --> 38:34.974
WORD CAME BACK HE'S
BEEN OPERATING

38:34.977 --> 38:36.445
WAY OUT OF HIS CHARTER.

38:36.447 --> 38:37.547
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:37.549 --> 38:39.016
- WELL, HE-HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE DEVELOPING

38:39.018 --> 38:40.618
FAST GROWN
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.

38:40.621 --> 38:42.156
BUT, WE HEAR HE'S
USING OUR FUNDING

38:42.158 --> 38:43.791
FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS.

38:43.794 --> 38:45.895
- AND YOU'RE
INVESTIGATING HIM?

38:45.898 --> 38:47.566
- YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS SO EASY
FOR ME TO PICK THAT LOCK

38:47.568 --> 38:49.001
BACK THERE?

38:49.004 --> 38:52.107
'CAUSE I PICKED IT
BEFORE, SEVERAL TIMES.

38:52.110 --> 38:53.910
- SO YOU'RE A SPY.

38:53.913 --> 38:57.383
- YEAH, BUT FOR
THE GOOD GUYS.

38:57.387 --> 38:58.420
- HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS
NOT JUST ANOTHER ONE

38:58.422 --> 39:00.256
OF YOUR STORIES?

39:00.259 --> 39:02.194
- I'VE GOT PROOF, COME ON.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.886
WALLA.

39:18.894 --> 39:20.762
- IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

39:20.765 --> 39:26.803
- YEP, IT'S MUSHROOM,
BIG FREAKIN' MUSHROOMS.

39:29.516 --> 39:31.850
- THEY MUST BE OVER
TWO STORIES TALL.

39:31.853 --> 39:34.121
- YEAH, THERE ABOUTS.

39:34.124 --> 39:35.491
- SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COULD FEED MILLIONS.

39:35.494 --> 39:37.128
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

39:37.130 --> 39:39.665
- IT WOULD BE...

39:39.669 --> 39:42.638
IF IT WERE THE ONLY
THING BEING GROWN.

39:49.854 --> 39:50.888
- IS HE THERE YET?

39:50.890 --> 39:52.291
- NO, BUT HIS EQUIPMENT IS.

39:52.293 --> 39:53.926
HE'S ALREADY BEEN
LOADED ONTO A BOAT.

39:53.929 --> 39:55.129
- GOOD.

39:55.131 --> 39:57.066
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM
WHAT HE'S GOING AFTER.

39:57.069 --> 39:59.070
BUT MAKE SURE
YOU REITERATE IT.

39:59.073 --> 40:00.574
- SURE, SURE.

40:00.576 --> 40:06.414
- LISTEN, VICTORIA,
IF THIS-- HOLD ON.

40:06.420 --> 40:08.087
YOU'RE EXCUSED, DOC.

40:08.090 --> 40:11.559
- I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL YOU
TAKE YOUR HEART MEDICATION.

40:27.394 --> 40:30.263
- LISTEN, VICTORIA,
IF THIS DISASTER

40:30.267 --> 40:34.136
IS SOMEHOW LINKED BACK TO
US, OUR FIRM IS FINISHED.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.974
I NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE ABLE TO TIE UP

40:35.977 --> 40:37.378
ALL THE LOOSE ENDS.

40:37.380 --> 40:38.913
- I'LL DO MY JOB.

40:38.916 --> 40:40.450
LET'S JUST HOPE THIS
BACKWARDS HILLBILLY YOU HIRED

40:40.452 --> 40:43.321
CAN DO HIS.

40:44.327 --> 40:45.193
AH, I THINK
HE'S JUST ARRIVED.

40:45.194 --> 40:46.127
- ALL RIGHT, I'M
COUNTING ON YOU.

40:46.129 --> 40:48.598
- I'LL SPEAK TO YOU LATER.

41:05.434 --> 41:06.600
YOU THE CAJUN?

41:06.602 --> 41:07.703
- WHAT GAVE IT AWAY?

41:07.705 --> 41:09.038
- YOU SMELL LIKE THE SWAMP.

41:09.041 --> 41:11.710
- YEAH, WELL I RAN
OUTTA OLD SPICE.

41:11.713 --> 41:12.979
- I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

41:12.981 --> 41:14.515
DRAKE SENT ME TO HELP OUT.

41:14.518 --> 41:15.518
- YOU GOT MY BOAT?

41:15.520 --> 41:16.654
- IT'S OVER HERE.

41:16.656 --> 41:18.357
GEAR'S ON BOARD, READY TO GO.

41:18.359 --> 41:19.659
- HOW ABOUT THE ENGINE?

41:19.661 --> 41:21.795
- MODIFIED TO YOUR
SPECS AS REQUESTED.

41:21.798 --> 41:23.065
- PERFECT.

41:23.068 --> 41:25.269
I'LL BE BACK WHEN
THE JOB'S DONE.

41:25.272 --> 41:28.475
- YOU, UH, DO REALIZE
WHAT'S OUT THERE, DON'T YOU?

41:28.479 --> 41:30.580
- YEAH.

41:34.991 --> 41:36.091
OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:36.093 --> 41:36.926
- COMING WITH YOU, OF COURSE.

41:36.927 --> 41:38.194
- OH, NO YOU'RE NOT.

41:38.197 --> 41:40.899
LOOK, FOR ME
THIS IS PLAY TIME.

41:40.902 --> 41:42.703
BUT FOR YOU COULD
BE A NIGHTMARE.

41:42.706 --> 41:44.507
AND BESIDES, I WORK ALONE.

41:44.510 --> 41:45.943
- NOT THIS TIME, COWBOY.

41:45.945 --> 41:48.680
MR. DRAKE, YOUR EMPLOYER
WANTS A FULL REPORT

41:48.683 --> 41:50.951
THE MOMENT THIS
MATTER'S RECTIFIED.

41:50.955 --> 41:54.291
LISTEN, SISTER, THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GETTING ON THIS BOAT

41:54.295 --> 41:57.764
AND THAT'S FINAL.

42:14.467 --> 42:15.500
- YOU'RE LOVING
THIS, AREN'T YOU?

42:15.502 --> 42:18.704
ALL THIS NATURE CRAP?

42:21.914 --> 42:25.650
- YEAH, EVERYTHING IN
THE CITY IS DEAD AND COLD.

42:25.655 --> 42:27.490
OUT HERE IT'S
ALIVE, YOU CAN FEEL IT.

42:27.492 --> 42:30.460
- DAMN, YOU REALLY
ARE A HILLBILLY.

42:31.566 --> 42:32.833
- YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE.

42:32.835 --> 42:34.135
FIRST YOU TELL ME I STINK,
NOW YOU'RE CALLING ME

42:34.138 --> 42:35.639
A HILLBILLY.

42:35.641 --> 42:37.742
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO FLIRT SO HARD.

42:37.745 --> 42:42.081
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

42:44.190 --> 42:47.159
SO, UH, DRAKE PAYING YOU A NICE
BUNDLE FOR THIS JOB THEN?

42:47.163 --> 42:48.831
- YEAH.

42:48.833 --> 42:50.634
THAT'S NOT WHY
I'M DOING IT.

42:50.637 --> 42:53.138
IT'S FOR THE CHALLENGE.

42:53.141 --> 42:55.042
- I'D RATHER HAVE THE CASH.

42:55.045 --> 42:58.581
- DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I'M GONNA KEEP THE CASH.

43:18.802 --> 43:20.436
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

43:20.436 --> 43:21.903
- FROM WHAT I GATHERED
THEY STUMBLED ON A WAY

43:21.903 --> 43:25.305
TO STIMULATE PLANT GROWTH BY
USING ELEMENTS FROM ANIMAL DNA.

43:25.305 --> 43:27.474
- WHAT KIND OF ANIMALS?

43:27.474 --> 43:28.206
WHAT WAS THAT?

43:28.206 --> 43:29.006
- HELP ME.

43:29.007 --> 43:29.874
- SOMEBODY COMING!

43:29.874 --> 43:32.275

43:32.275 --> 43:34.376
WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

43:34.376 --> 43:35.276
IT'S COMING.

43:35.277 --> 43:36.043
- WAIT, WHAT'S COMING?!

43:36.043 --> 43:37.578
[growling]

43:37.579 --> 43:38.278
- THAT.

43:38.278 --> 43:39.078
THAT'S WHAT'S COMING.

43:39.079 --> 43:40.379
COME ON.

43:44.915 --> 43:47.283
- GET UP.

43:48.617 --> 43:53.287
- OKAY.

43:53.286 --> 43:55.253
GO!

44:19.633 --> 44:20.967
COME ON!

44:44.612 --> 44:46.312
- JEEZ.

45:09.491 --> 45:11.626
- LOOK, THERE!

45:12.993 --> 45:15.694
MY GOD, IS THAT IT?

45:15.693 --> 45:18.962
- IT'S DAMN SURE ONE OF THEM.

45:20.663 --> 45:22.030
MISS CHASE, YOU
WANTED ON THIS BOAT,

45:22.030 --> 45:23.163
YOU GOTTA EARN
YOUR KEEP.

45:23.164 --> 45:24.097
COME ON OVER HERE.

45:24.097 --> 45:25.097
TAKE THE WHEEL.

45:25.098 --> 45:26.298
JUST HOLD IT
STRAIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

45:26.298 --> 45:27.566
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

45:27.567 --> 45:29.635
- I'M GONNA TRY AND KILL
THAT WHILE I GOT THE CHASE.

45:51.578 --> 45:53.278
- AH!

45:54.780 --> 45:55.647
DRIVE!

45:55.647 --> 45:56.847
DRIVE!

45:56.848 --> 45:58.949
- WHAT DO YOU
THINK I'M DOING?

46:04.752 --> 46:06.619
- WELL, THAT TOOK
CARE OF HIM FOR NOW.

46:06.619 --> 46:08.153
- SO?

46:08.153 --> 46:11.756
- SO I GUESS
PLAY TIME'S OVER.

46:41.203 --> 46:42.938
- SO, YOU FEELING BETTER?

46:42.938 --> 46:44.705
- MUCH BETTER, THANK YOU.

46:44.705 --> 46:46.405
- GOOD ENOUGH TO
ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS?

46:46.405 --> 46:48.106
- DAD, PLEASE, SHE'S
BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

46:48.106 --> 46:49.774
- NO, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

46:49.774 --> 46:51.575
THE ENTIRE ISLAND
POPULATION IS AT RISK.

46:51.575 --> 46:53.341
- SO WHAT CAN YOU
TELL US, MISS, UH--

46:53.342 --> 46:56.311
- TAFT, KIMBERLY TAFT.

46:56.310 --> 46:58.879
AND UP UNTIL 36 HOURS AGO I
WORKED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

46:58.879 --> 47:01.614
OF THE ISLAND ON THE
DRAKE GAME PRESERVE.

47:01.613 --> 47:03.647
- AND, UH, WHAT
DID YOU DO THERE?

47:03.647 --> 47:05.081
- WELL, FOR THE
LAST TEN MONTHS,

47:05.082 --> 47:07.617
MY BROTHER STEWART AND I WERE
DEVELOPING A NEW BIOCATALYST

47:07.616 --> 47:09.483
TO INCREASE PLANT GROWTH.

47:09.483 --> 47:12.886
AND AT FIRST WE EXPERIENCE
INCREDIBLE SUCCESS.

47:12.886 --> 47:14.887
- YEAH, WE SAW YOU HANDIWORK
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.

47:14.887 --> 47:16.888
AMAZING.

47:16.888 --> 47:20.924
- BELIEVE ME, IT WAS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

47:20.923 --> 47:23.592
AFTER DRAKE INDUSTRIES GREEN
LIT THE PROJECT MY BROTHER

47:23.591 --> 47:27.560
ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF THE MOST
RENOWN MEN IN BIOTECHNOLOGY.

47:27.559 --> 47:30.360
DUE MAINLY TO HIS
REVOLUTIONARY DNA MATRIX,

47:30.360 --> 47:33.897
WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE
ASTOUNDING BREAKTHROUGHS.

47:33.896 --> 47:36.931
EVERYTHING WAS GOING ALONG
FINE, UNTIL THE DAY WE HAD

47:36.931 --> 47:39.967
THE VIDEO CONFERENCE
WITH CHASE AND DRAKE.

47:39.966 --> 47:43.334
- DOCTOR, I'D SAY
CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

47:43.333 --> 47:46.035
AFTER DUE DELIBERATION
I'VE DECIDED TO EXPAND

47:46.035 --> 47:47.703
YOUR LITTLE OPERATION.

47:47.703 --> 47:48.603
- REALLY?

47:48.604 --> 47:49.637
HOW SO?

47:49.637 --> 47:50.770
- WELL, FOR STARTERS

47:50.771 --> 47:52.939
WE'RE THINKING OF
TRIPLING YOUR FUNDING.

47:52.939 --> 47:55.540
- TRIPLING?

47:55.539 --> 47:57.674
AND WHO DO I HAVE TO
KILL TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

47:57.674 --> 47:59.041
- NO ONE.

47:59.042 --> 48:02.144
NOW, ALL WE WANT FROM YOU
IS FOR YOU TO EXPLORE

48:02.143 --> 48:05.012
THE POTENTIAL OF
THE GROWTH MATRIX

48:05.012 --> 48:07.780
ON A COUPLE OF
LIVING ANIMALS.

48:07.779 --> 48:10.715
- WHAT SORT OF ANIMALS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

48:10.715 --> 48:18.121
- WELL, DOCTOR, NOW YOU
CAN START WITH THESE.

48:20.586 --> 48:21.953
- THIS IS INSANE.

48:21.953 --> 48:23.787
- I WAS ALWAYS AGAINST
APPLYING OUR THEORIES

48:23.787 --> 48:25.321
TO ANIMALS.

48:25.321 --> 48:28.389
BUT MY BROTHER WAS FEARFUL
OF LOOSING OUR FUNDING.

48:28.389 --> 48:30.124
- KIMBERLY,
PLEASE RECONSIDER.

48:30.124 --> 48:31.958
IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO
WITH THREE MILLION DOLLARS

48:31.958 --> 48:33.058
IN FUNDING?

48:33.059 --> 48:34.760
- STEW, IT JUST
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

48:34.760 --> 48:37.595
WE NEVER AGREED TO EXPERIMENT
ON LIVING CREATURES.

48:37.594 --> 48:38.427
- SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

48:38.428 --> 48:39.595
TELL HIM NO?

48:39.595 --> 48:41.462
SACRIFICE EVERYTHING
WE WORKED SO HARD FOR?

48:41.462 --> 48:44.732
- NO, WE STICK TO THE
ORIGINAL AGREEMENT.

48:44.732 --> 48:48.534
WE ARE HERE TO GROW FOOD, NOT
CREATE GENETIC FRANKENSTEINS.

48:48.533 --> 48:50.434
- AND WHAT IF HE
WON'T GO ALONG WITH US?

48:50.434 --> 48:52.135
- THEN I WILL PACK
MY BAGS RIGHT NOW

48:52.135 --> 48:53.869
AND GET ON A PLANE BACK
TO THE MAINLAND.

48:53.869 --> 48:55.803
- AND KILL THE PROJECT?

48:55.803 --> 48:57.904
KIM, I CAN'T DO
THIS WITHOUT YOU.

48:57.904 --> 48:59.805
PLEASE.

48:59.805 --> 49:01.339
- OKAY.

49:01.339 --> 49:02.773
OKAY.

49:02.774 --> 49:05.442
BUT YOU PROMISE ME, AT THE
FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE,

49:05.441 --> 49:06.875
WE PULL THE PLUG.

49:06.876 --> 49:08.143
- FINE.

49:08.143 --> 49:08.843
- OKAY.

49:08.844 --> 49:09.744
I'LL CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.

49:09.744 --> 49:11.577
- GIVE ME A HUG.

49:15.412 --> 49:18.248
GOOD LUCK.

49:20.950 --> 49:24.252
- GET ME JASON
DRAKE ON THE PHONE.

49:24.251 --> 49:25.885
- WHAT MADE DRAKE
CHOOSE THOSE SPECIES?

49:25.885 --> 49:27.318
- BECAUSE THEY BOTH
ARE AMPHIBIOUS

49:27.318 --> 49:29.987
AND THEY HAVE A HIGH
IMMUNITY TO HUMAN DISEASES.

49:29.987 --> 49:32.956
DRAKE HOPED THAT THEIR
DNA COULD CREATE A VACCINE.

49:32.956 --> 49:35.290
A VACCINE THAT WOULD NOT
ONLY MAKE HUMANS IMMUNE

49:35.289 --> 49:38.825
TO BIOLOGICAL AGENTS, BUT
WOULD MAKE THEM STRONGER

49:38.825 --> 49:42.161
AND MORE AGILE, AS WELL.

49:42.160 --> 49:44.728
- SOUNDS LIKE DRAKE WANTED
HIMSELF SOME SUPER SOLDIERS.

49:44.728 --> 49:46.729
- HE WAS TWISTING
MY BROTHER'S WORK.

49:46.729 --> 49:51.432
STEWART WANTED TO FEED THE
WORLD, NOT BUILD ARMIES.

49:51.430 --> 49:52.865
- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

49:52.866 --> 49:55.267
- WELL, WE BOMBARDED BOTH
ANIMALS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

49:55.266 --> 49:58.035
IN MY BROTHERS REACTOR...

49:58.035 --> 50:02.071
BUT WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT
RESULTS OR CHANGE.

50:02.070 --> 50:07.474
AND THEN TWO DAYS AGO WHEN
STEWART WENT TO FEED THEM...

50:07.472 --> 50:10.407
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

50:10.407 --> 50:12.809
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

50:18.879 --> 50:20.379
EVERYBODY OUT NOW.

50:20.379 --> 50:24.348
IT'S ESCAPED.

51:04.835 --> 51:07.403
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

51:08.403 --> 51:10.604
- CALM DOWN.

51:12.138 --> 51:15.007
- NO!

51:15.006 --> 51:17.107
I CALLED DRAKE JUST AS
ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE

51:17.107 --> 51:18.340
AND HE TOLD ME
TO CALM DOWN.

51:18.341 --> 51:21.043
CALM DOWN?

51:21.042 --> 51:24.277
THE BASTARD.

51:24.277 --> 51:28.915
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
THING DID TO MY BROTHER?

51:30.447 --> 51:35.284
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GIVE THE
LITTLE LADY A CHANCE TO REST.

51:46.922 --> 51:48.055
I GOTTA GO BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

51:48.056 --> 51:49.023
- OKAY.

51:49.023 --> 51:50.190
- I'M GONNA
STICK AROUND HERE.

51:50.191 --> 51:52.058
- LET'S GET SOME FOOD, YEAH?

52:06.432 --> 52:08.433
- OH, CHAD, THIS
PLACE IS AMAZING.

52:08.433 --> 52:10.334
- YEAH, REALLY.

52:10.334 --> 52:11.935
- WELL, YOU CAN'T
SEE IT NOW, GIRLS.

52:11.935 --> 52:14.837
BUT IN THE MORNING I
HAVE AN INCREDIBLE VIEW

52:14.836 --> 52:17.971
OF A PRIVATE BEACH THAT GOES
ON FOR NEARLY HALF A MILE.

52:17.971 --> 52:19.304
- WOW.

52:19.304 --> 52:20.504
I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

52:20.505 --> 52:21.639
- ME, TOO.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.240
- WELL, LET'S RUSH
TOMORROW WHILE WE HAVE

52:23.240 --> 52:25.608
SO MUCH WONDERFUL
BEAUTY IN THE HOUSE.

52:25.608 --> 52:28.176
- I'LL SECOND THAT.

52:28.176 --> 52:31.812
- AND I'LL THIRD THAT.

52:31.811 --> 52:33.846
IS THAT RIGHT?

52:33.846 --> 52:36.347
- ABSOLUTELY.

52:36.347 --> 52:38.715
COME.

52:45.084 --> 52:47.552
YOU KNOW, GIRLS, AFTER
SHOOTING FOR THREE MONTHS

52:47.552 --> 52:50.520
I REALLY NEEDED THIS.

52:50.520 --> 52:53.356
- SO WHEN DOES THE NEW
"MANIAC MAN" COME OUT?

52:53.355 --> 52:55.289
- OCTOBER, AS USUAL.

52:55.289 --> 52:56.857
JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME
I'LL BE PUTTING TOGETHER

52:56.857 --> 52:59.691
THE SCRIPT FOR NEXT
YEAR'S FOLLOW UP.

52:59.691 --> 53:01.092
- HOW MANY HAVE
YOU DONE SO FAR?

53:01.092 --> 53:04.294
- THIS WILL BE NUMBER SIX.

53:04.294 --> 53:06.729
- DO YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING FOR VICKIE OR ME

53:06.729 --> 53:08.296
IN PART SEVEN?

53:08.296 --> 53:11.498
- THAT ALL DEPENDS, HOW
GOOD OF A SCREAMER ARE YOU?

53:11.497 --> 53:12.898
- OH, I'M THE BEST.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.398
LISTEN.

53:14.399 --> 53:16.000
AH!

53:16.000 --> 53:17.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

53:17.067 --> 53:18.200
- NOT BAD.

53:18.201 --> 53:20.569
- OH, I CAN DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

53:20.569 --> 53:22.603
CHECK THIS.

53:22.603 --> 53:25.839
AH!

53:25.838 --> 53:27.038
GOOD, HUH?

53:27.038 --> 53:28.639
- WELL, I THINK YOU
HAVE POTENTIAL, MONICA.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.242
BUT TO REALLY MAKE YOUR
MARK IN HORROR MOVIES

53:31.241 --> 53:34.509
YOU'VE GOT TO
GIVE IT YOUR ALL.

53:34.509 --> 53:35.943
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

53:35.943 --> 53:38.912
- WELL, AS I TELL MY
ACTRESSES ON SET,

53:38.911 --> 53:43.148
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK OF THE
WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE.

53:43.147 --> 53:47.250
FEEL THE FEAR DEEP
WITHIN YOUR SOUL.

53:47.249 --> 53:52.419
OPEN YOUR EYES, LOOK UP, AND
SCREAM LIKE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

53:52.418 --> 53:54.452
DEPENDED ON IT.

53:54.452 --> 53:55.653
[growling]

53:55.653 --> 53:57.620
- WHAT WAS THAT?

54:00.592 --> 54:03.015
- AAAH!

54:35.513 --> 54:36.581
- SECOND FLOOR.

54:36.581 --> 54:37.714
- YES, THIS IS DR. RHODES.

54:37.715 --> 54:39.649
WE NEED TO DO AN
ICU, IMMEDIATELY.

54:39.649 --> 54:40.849
- DR. RHODES?

54:40.849 --> 54:42.617
- YES, FROM MOLOKAI GENERAL.

54:42.617 --> 54:44.350
- RIGHT AWAY.

55:22.166 --> 55:23.033
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

55:23.034 --> 55:24.301
- SOMETHING BAD.

55:24.301 --> 55:26.035
- NO!

55:41.441 --> 55:43.109
- HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

56:17.057 --> 56:17.924
- PAUL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

56:17.924 --> 56:18.690
ARE YOU OKAY?

56:18.691 --> 56:20.191
- WHAT HAPPENED?

56:20.191 --> 56:23.060
- THAT GIRL OF
YOURS, SHE KILLED HER.

56:23.059 --> 56:24.093
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

56:24.094 --> 56:24.860
- I DON'T KNOW.

56:24.860 --> 56:26.494
SHE MUST
HAVE RUN OUT.

56:26.495 --> 56:27.394
- I'M GOING AFTER HER.

56:27.394 --> 56:28.528
- OKAY.

56:34.331 --> 56:38.801
[phone rings]

56:44.836 --> 56:45.802
- HELLO.

56:45.802 --> 56:46.969
- MARK, I AM SORRY
TO WAKE YOU,

56:46.970 --> 56:49.471
BUT I JUST RAN INTO SOME
BIG TROUBLE OUT HERE.

56:49.470 --> 56:50.838
- YEAH, PAUL, WHAT'S UP?

56:50.839 --> 56:52.339
- WELL, DRAKE DID
EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT.

56:52.339 --> 56:54.641
HE CREATED SOME GIANT MONSTER
IN THAT THINK TANK OF HIS

56:54.640 --> 56:55.873
AND THEY'VE GOTTEN LOOSE.

56:55.874 --> 56:57.307
- POSITIVE?

56:57.307 --> 56:58.241
- I'M MORE THAN POSITIVE.

56:58.241 --> 56:59.608
I WAS NEARLY
TRAMPLED BY ONE

56:59.609 --> 57:01.644
AFTER I RAN INTO ONE
OF HIS GENETICISTS.

57:01.643 --> 57:06.947
SHE SPILLED THE BEANS ON THE
WHOLE STORY AFTER WE ESCAPED.

57:06.945 --> 57:07.878
- OKAY, LOOK, WE HAVE TO
GET HER IN FRONT OF THE, UH,

57:07.879 --> 57:09.847
COMMITTEE TO TESTIFY.

57:09.847 --> 57:11.047
HOW SOON CAN
YOU GET HER HERE?

57:11.047 --> 57:12.014
- WELL, I CAN'T.

57:12.014 --> 57:13.848
SHE'S DEAD.

57:13.848 --> 57:14.948
- HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

57:14.949 --> 57:16.415
- ONE OF DRAKE'S
PEOPLE DID IT.

57:16.415 --> 57:18.250
NEARLY TOOK ME
OUT IN THE PROCESS.

57:18.250 --> 57:19.717
- SO WE GOT NOTHING.

57:19.717 --> 57:21.084
- ACTUALLY, BEFORE SHE DIED

57:21.084 --> 57:22.785
I RECORDED EVERYTHING SHE
HAD TO SAY ON VIDEO.

57:22.785 --> 57:24.318
SO, I THINK WE'VE GOT
MORE THAN ENOUGH

57:24.318 --> 57:26.887
TO PUT DRAKE AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

57:26.887 --> 57:29.155
- GOOD, SEND ME AN
MP4 OF THAT RIGHT AWAY.

57:29.155 --> 57:30.388
I'LL GET IT
OVER TO ROBERTSON.

57:30.388 --> 57:31.722
- ALL RIGHT, WILL DO.

57:31.722 --> 57:34.024
OH, HAVE THE BUREAU PUT
OUT AN ALL POINTS ON A WOMAN

57:34.024 --> 57:35.691
NAMED VICTORIA CHASE.

57:35.691 --> 57:36.758
- WHO'S SHE?

57:36.758 --> 57:38.759
- SHE'S THE WOMAN
WHO TRIED TO KILL ME.

57:38.759 --> 57:40.126
I THINK SHE'S PROBABLY
SKIPPED THE ISLAND BY NOW.

57:40.126 --> 57:42.027
PROBABLY ON HER WAY
BACK TO SEE DRAKE.

57:42.027 --> 57:44.327
- OKAY, I'LL
HANDLE HER PERSONALLY.

57:44.327 --> 57:45.528
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

57:45.528 --> 57:46.261
WATCH YOUR SIX.

57:46.262 --> 57:46.995
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

57:46.995 --> 57:48.696
- ALL RIGHT.

57:57.134 --> 57:58.734
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

57:58.734 --> 58:00.434
- I'M EXTRACTING SOME DATA.

58:00.434 --> 58:03.704
TURNING KIM'S
TESTIMONY INTO AN MP4.

58:08.938 --> 58:10.605
- DAD, WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

58:10.605 --> 58:12.140
- CYANIDE.

58:12.140 --> 58:14.607
ENOUGH IN HER TO
KILL 20 PEOPLE.

58:14.607 --> 58:17.409
- I HOPE YOUR DEPUTIES
FOUND THE BITCH WHO DID THIS.

58:17.408 --> 58:18.909
- YOU AIN'T GONNA FIND HER.

58:18.909 --> 58:20.543
THAT GIRL'S A SNAKE.

58:20.543 --> 58:22.844
SHE KNOWS HOW TO SLITHER
AWAY OUT OF TIGHT SPOTS.

58:22.844 --> 58:25.012
SHE'S PROBABLY HALF WAY
TO THE MAINLAND BY NOW.

58:25.012 --> 58:26.813
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
WE SHOULD JUST LET HER GO?

58:26.813 --> 58:28.313
- NO, I'M SAYING WE SHOULD
DEAL WITH THOSE TWO LIZARDS

58:28.313 --> 58:29.547
RIGHT NOW.

58:29.547 --> 58:31.481
OTHERWISE THAT LADY
DIED FOR NOTHING.

58:31.481 --> 58:33.248
- SOUNDS LIKE A JOB
FOR THE MILITARY.

58:33.248 --> 58:35.416
- FIRSTLY, NOBODY IN THE
MILITARY'S GONNA BELIEVE YOU.

58:35.416 --> 58:37.785
AND SECONDLY,
SOLDIERS AIN'T NO GOOD.

58:37.784 --> 58:38.884
I KNOW LIZARDS.

58:38.885 --> 58:40.485
THEY'RE PRETTY SMART.

58:40.485 --> 58:41.752
THEY KNOW WHEN
THEY'RE BEING HUNTED.

58:41.752 --> 58:43.586
THEY GONNA HUNKER
DOWN AND LAY LOW.

58:43.586 --> 58:46.421
THEY CAN GO WEEKS WITHOUT
EATING AND THEN JUST WHEN YOU

58:46.420 --> 58:50.123
EASE UP AND YOU STOP LOOKING
THEY'RE BACK WITH VENGEANCE.

58:50.122 --> 58:54.659
- SO WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

58:57.993 --> 59:01.461
- ALLIGATOR AND
CROCODILE AND MORTAL ENEMIES.

59:01.460 --> 59:03.696
I SAY WE BRING
'EM TOGETHER.

59:03.696 --> 59:06.130
WE MAKE 'EM FIGHT.

59:06.129 --> 59:08.597
AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE
CAN TAKE OUT THE WINNER

59:08.597 --> 59:12.633
WHEN IT'S MOST
VULNERABLE.

59:13.766 --> 59:16.902
- SO, HOW DO YOU
PROPOSE WE DO THAT?

59:31.973 --> 59:32.907
ALL SET?

59:32.908 --> 59:34.942
- EVERYTHING'S
ON BOARD, SIR.

59:47.847 --> 59:49.480
- WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

59:49.480 --> 59:51.548
- JUST, UH, SENDING
SOME HATE MAIL.

59:51.548 --> 59:53.983
- WHAT?

59:53.983 --> 59:56.685
- NOTHING, I-I'LL
TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.

59:56.684 --> 01:00:00.620
- YOU KNOW, SON, YOU LOOK LIKE
A DAMN FOOL IN THAT SHIRT.

01:00:00.619 --> 01:00:02.486
ALL THE INSTRUMENTS ARE
LOADED ON THE CHOPPERS.

01:00:02.486 --> 01:00:04.287
- THANKS, SHERIFF.

01:00:04.287 --> 01:00:05.654
- WHAT KIND OF
RIG IS IT, LOGAN?

01:00:05.654 --> 01:00:07.923
- IT'S A FLIR DOUBLE A Q-26.

01:00:07.923 --> 01:00:09.423
- NICE.

01:00:09.423 --> 01:00:12.358
- UH, EXCUSE ME, SOME OF
US DON'T SPEAK TECHNO-NERD.

01:00:12.357 --> 01:00:15.059
- SORRY, A FLIR IS SHORT
FOR FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED.

01:00:15.059 --> 01:00:18.161
IT DETECTS WARM OBJECTS BY
MEASURING THERMAL ENERGY.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.194
- YOU MEAN LIKE
POLICE HELICOPTERS

01:00:19.194 --> 01:00:20.627
USE TO TRACK
CRIMINALS AT NIGHT?

01:00:20.628 --> 01:00:22.129
- EXACTLY.

01:00:22.129 --> 01:00:23.429
SEE THEM LIZARDS, THEY MIGHT BE
ABLE TO HIDE UNDER A PALM TREE

01:00:23.429 --> 01:00:25.296
OR IN THE WATER, BUT THEY
AIN'T GONNA HIDE FROM THIS.

01:00:25.296 --> 01:00:26.764
NOW WE FLY OVER THEM,

01:00:26.764 --> 01:00:28.898
THE HEAT SIGNATURE'S GONNA
SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN.

01:00:28.898 --> 01:00:30.232
- IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
HOW YOU'RE GONNA GET 'EM

01:00:30.232 --> 01:00:31.632
INTO THE RING.

01:00:31.632 --> 01:00:33.700
- A GATOR AND A CROCODILE ARE
REALLY SENSITIVE TO SOUND.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.068
SO ONCE WE LOCATE EXACTLY
WHERE THEY ARE WE'LL SURROUND

01:00:36.068 --> 01:00:39.303
THEM USING EXPLOSIVES
AND DRIVE 'EM TOGETHER.

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.470
- HOPEFULLY NOT TO
THE CENTER OF TOWN.

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:43.271
- HOPEFULLY NOT.

01:00:43.271 --> 01:00:45.372
WELL, FIRST THING WE
GOTTA DO IS FIND THEM.

01:00:45.371 --> 01:00:46.038
WE CAN'T DO
THAT SITTING HERE.

01:00:46.039 --> 01:00:48.073
SO, LET'S SADDLE UP.

01:00:52.742 --> 01:00:54.275
- GOOD LUCK, PARTNER.

01:00:57.244 --> 01:00:58.978
- LISTEN, I CALLED
IN ALL MY MEN TODAY

01:00:58.978 --> 01:01:01.279
AND DEPUTIZED
SOME RANCHERS.

01:01:02.579 --> 01:01:05.181
JUST LET ME KNOW WHERE THEY
ARE WE'LL GET AFTER THEM.

01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:12.617
- SOUNDS GOOD.

01:01:12.617 --> 01:01:16.253
SURE YOU DON'T WANNA TAKE A
NICE SCENIC HELICOPTER RIDE?

01:01:24.388 --> 01:01:26.322
- I'LL BE MORE HELP ON
THE GROUND WITH MY DAD.

01:01:26.322 --> 01:01:27.857
- ALL RIGHT.

01:01:27.857 --> 01:01:31.459
WELL, UH, YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, OFFICER.

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:34.293
- COME HERE.

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:41.897
- CRAP, I DON'T NEED
TO SEE THIS, COME ON.

01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:44.403
- OKAY.

01:01:53.184 --> 01:01:55.901
¶       ¶... 

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.560
- AND HERE WE ARE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

01:03:57.563 --> 01:03:59.731
AT THE FAMED COCO
PALMS HOTEL.

01:03:59.734 --> 01:04:03.537
BUILT OVER FIVE DECADES
AGO IN 1953 THE RESORT

01:04:03.543 --> 01:04:07.479
ULTIMATELY EXPANDED
TO OVER 400 ROOMS.

01:04:07.485 --> 01:04:09.820
IT BECAME THE PREMIER
HOTEL ON THE ISLAND

01:04:09.824 --> 01:04:15.529
BEFORE HURRICANE NIKKI
LEFT IT IN RUINS IN 1992.

01:04:22.987 --> 01:04:24.988
DURING IT'S HEYDAY WITH
ITS LUSH GREEN SCENERY

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:28.361
AND IT'S WHITE SANDY BEACHES
IT BROUGHT HOLLYWOOD ICONS

01:04:28.367 --> 01:04:32.302
LIKE BING CROSBY, FRANK SINATRA,
AND YES, EVEN ELVIS PRESLEY

01:04:32.308 --> 01:04:33.576
TO THE RESORT.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.579
- OH, WHAT ROOM DID
THE KING STAY IN?

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:37.316
- I KNEW SOMEONE WAS
GOING TO ASK THAT.

01:04:37.319 --> 01:04:39.488
HE HAD ONE OF THE
PRIVATE CABANAS IN THE BACK.

01:04:39.492 --> 01:04:41.860
BUT, WE'LL SEE THAT IN
JUST A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

01:04:41.864 --> 01:04:43.865
- OH, IT ALMOST MAKES
COMING HERE WORTH IT.

01:04:45.037 --> 01:04:46.004
- OKAY, BAM-BAM, COME ON.

01:04:46.006 --> 01:04:48.541
LET'S GO NOW.

01:05:07.455 --> 01:05:08.521
- ANYTHING?

01:05:08.524 --> 01:05:10.625
- NOTHING SO FAR.

01:05:20.986 --> 01:05:23.420
WAIT A MINUTE,
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.

01:05:23.424 --> 01:05:25.392
OH, YEAH, THIS HEAT
SIGNATURE IS WAY TOO BIG

01:05:25.395 --> 01:05:27.029
TO BE ANYTHING HUMAN.

01:05:27.032 --> 01:05:28.600
- WHAT'S YOUR POSITION?

01:05:28.603 --> 01:05:31.004
- JUST OVER THE NORTHWEST
CORNER OF THE ISLAND

01:05:31.008 --> 01:05:34.544
RIGHT OVER
THE OLD SUGAR FACTORY.

01:05:36.487 --> 01:05:40.356
GARDNER, CAN YOU TAKE
THIS THING DOWN ANY LOWER?

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:45.771
- NO WAY I'M GONNA
LAND NEXT TO THAT THING.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.247
- DO YOU SEE THAT, LOGAN?

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.416
- I HAVE A VISUAL.

01:05:50.419 --> 01:05:52.053
- WELL, WHAT NOW?

01:05:52.056 --> 01:05:53.623
- LET'S GET BACK
TO THE HANGER.

01:05:53.626 --> 01:05:55.561
I'LL GET MY EXPLOSIVE
AND A FOUR BY FOUR.

01:05:55.564 --> 01:05:57.898
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT
THING ONCE AND FOR ALL.

01:05:59.105 --> 01:06:01.139
- WAIT A MINUTE, I THINK
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

01:06:01.143 --> 01:06:02.177
- WHAT'S THAT?

01:06:02.179 --> 01:06:04.013
- I'LL TELL YA
BACK AT BASE CAMP.

01:06:15.509 --> 01:06:16.943
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

01:06:16.946 --> 01:06:19.247
- THAT SUGAR FACTORY SITS
IN THE MIDDLE OF A VALLEY

01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:21.419
AND THE ONLY WAY IN OR OUT
IS THROUGH A TUNNEL UP

01:06:21.422 --> 01:06:22.889
THROUGH THE SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN.

01:06:22.892 --> 01:06:24.860
NOW IF WE COULD FIND THAT
GATOR, DRIVE HIM IN THERE

01:06:24.864 --> 01:06:26.999
AND BLOW THE TUNNEL CLOSED,
THERE'D BE NO WAY TO ESCAPE,

01:06:27.002 --> 01:06:28.035
THEY'D HAVE TO FIGHT.

01:06:28.038 --> 01:06:28.904
- I LIKE IT.

01:06:28.906 --> 01:06:30.073
I LIKE IT.

01:06:30.075 --> 01:06:30.942
I'VE GOT ENOUGH C-4 IN
MY SUPPLIES TO START

01:06:30.944 --> 01:06:32.477
A FULL SCALE LANDSLIDE.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.982
I'M GONNA NEED SOMEBODY TO
HELP ME SET THE CHARGES.

01:06:34.987 --> 01:06:36.587
- I LOVE BLOWING UP TUNNELS.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:38.324
IT'S A HOBBY OF MINE.

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.662
- YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES.

01:06:39.665 --> 01:06:40.597
HOW ABOUT THAT SHERIFF?

01:06:40.599 --> 01:06:42.000
YOU HEAR FROM HIM
ABOUT THAT GATOR?

01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:44.270
- HE'S GOT ALL HIS UNITS OUT
LOOKING BUT SO FAR NOTHING.

01:06:44.274 --> 01:06:45.440
- WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

01:06:45.443 --> 01:06:46.610
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:06:46.612 --> 01:06:48.213
- WELL, IT'S PAST NOON.

01:06:48.216 --> 01:06:52.319
THOSE LIZARDS THEY HUNT ON
THE HOTTEST PART OF THE DAY.

01:06:52.326 --> 01:06:55.461
- WHERE WOULD IT ATTACK?

01:06:55.466 --> 01:06:57.601
- WHEREVER THERE'S PEOPLE.

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:08.424
- OKAY, COME ON,
GATHER AROUND.

01:07:09.899 --> 01:07:12.467
THE COCO PALMS RESORT
ACHIEVED EARLY EXPOSURE

01:07:12.471 --> 01:07:17.075
AND FAME IN THE 1958 FILM,
"SHE-GODS OF SHARK REEF."

01:07:17.082 --> 01:07:19.951
VIRTUALLY, THE ENTIRE CLIMAX
OF THE MOVIE WAS SHOT

01:07:19.956 --> 01:07:23.058
RIGHT HERE ON THE GROUNDS
OR NEAR THE HOTEL.

01:07:23.063 --> 01:07:23.863
- I REMEMBER THAT FILM.

01:07:23.865 --> 01:07:25.065
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

01:07:25.067 --> 01:07:27.068
BUT WHERE'S THIS ELVIS
ROOM YOU SPOKE ABOUT?

01:07:27.072 --> 01:07:28.472
- I KNOW, DON'T WORRY.

01:07:28.474 --> 01:07:30.809
I PROMISE WE'RE
GETTING THERE.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.181
NOW, IF YOU'LL ALL
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

01:07:33.185 --> 01:07:35.186
COME ON.

01:08:40.238 --> 01:08:42.038
- ALL RIGHT, BEST WAY TO
TAKE THIS THING DOWN IS--

01:08:42.042 --> 01:08:43.274
- HIT THE STRESS POINTS.

01:08:43.277 --> 01:08:45.345
- EXACTLY.

01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:48.017
- DRAKE, HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO PAY FOR WHAT HE DID.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.587
- HE WILL.

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:51.658
I EMAILED KIM'S TESTIMONY
THAT I VIDEO TAPED

01:08:51.662 --> 01:08:53.296
TO A FRIEND OF MINE.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.268
- WHAT KIND OF FRIEND?

01:08:55.272 --> 01:08:57.974
- THE SERIOUS KIND.

01:09:04.626 --> 01:09:05.926
- ANY WORD FROM HAWAII?

01:09:05.928 --> 01:09:06.928
- JUST THAT THERE'S
PROBABILITY

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:09.566
THAT SHE'LL
SHOW UP HERE.

01:09:12.276 --> 01:09:13.477
- AND WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE?

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:15.381
FEMALE DRIVER,
LATE MODEL SEDAN.

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:16.617
- IT'S GOTTA BE OUR GIRL.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.754
- LET'S GO.

01:09:36.365 --> 01:09:37.865
- VICTORIA, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:09:37.868 --> 01:09:40.303
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON
THE ISLAND HELPING THE CAJUN.

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:41.274
- I CAUGHT THE
REDEYE CHARTER.

01:09:41.276 --> 01:09:44.111
GOT IN ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

01:09:50.263 --> 01:09:51.464
- WHAT'S WRONG?

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:53.300
- HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE
CLEARING UP YOUR MESS.

01:09:53.303 --> 01:09:55.337
ALL THANKS TO
THAT HICK YOU HIRED.

01:10:04.562 --> 01:10:06.830
- FREEZE, FBI.

01:10:06.834 --> 01:10:09.936
PUT YOUR HANDS OUT
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:14.446
- OFFICER, THERE-THERE
MUST BE SOME MISTAKE HERE.

01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:16.385
- THAT'S RIGHT, MR. DRAKE,
AND YOU MADE IT.

01:10:16.389 --> 01:10:17.956
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
INVESTIGATION FOR THE ABUSE

01:10:17.959 --> 01:10:20.528
OF GENETIC ENGINEERING
REGULATIONS FOR MONTHS NOW.

01:10:20.532 --> 01:10:22.666
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
UNTIL WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:24.871
THAT CONTAINED THE VIDEO
DEPOSITION OF ONE,

01:10:24.874 --> 01:10:26.575
KIMBERLY TAFT.

01:10:26.579 --> 01:10:28.180
DOES THAT NAME
RING A BELL?

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:29.683
- SHE WAS FOUND MURDERED
LAST NIGHT IN HAWAII.

01:10:29.686 --> 01:10:32.688
AND GUESS WHO THE
PRIME SUSPECT IS?

01:10:33.728 --> 01:10:36.197
- OW.

01:10:36.201 --> 01:10:38.868
- AH.

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:44.584
- MR. DRAKE, ARE YOU OKAY?

01:10:44.587 --> 01:10:45.286
ARE YOU HIT?

01:10:45.287 --> 01:10:46.087
- NO.

01:10:46.089 --> 01:10:47.956
NO, IT-IT'S MY HEART.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.294
- OKAY, I'LL GET SOME HELP.

01:10:49.296 --> 01:10:51.598
WHAT ABOUT HER?

01:10:53.773 --> 01:10:56.141
YEAH, I'M GONNA NEED MEDAVAC
ASAP, POSSIBLE HEART ATTACK

01:10:56.145 --> 01:10:59.180
AND, UH, SEND A
MEAT WAGON.

01:10:59.185 --> 01:11:00.319
- WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?

01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:02.556
- FREEZE, WHO ARE YOU?

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.993
- I'M MR. DRAKE'S NURSE.

01:11:03.996 --> 01:11:04.829
- YOU'RE HIS NURSE?

01:11:04.831 --> 01:11:06.165
GET DOWN HERE.

01:11:06.168 --> 01:11:07.369
HE'S IN TROUBLE.

01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:10.406
COME ON, OVER HERE.

01:11:12.349 --> 01:11:13.416
YES, SAME ADDRESS.

01:11:13.418 --> 01:11:15.419
- MR. DRAKE!

01:11:15.423 --> 01:11:17.658
OH, GOD, KEEP BREATHING.

01:11:17.662 --> 01:11:19.396
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:20.465
OH, NO.

01:11:20.467 --> 01:11:22.435
OH, NO.

01:11:31.793 --> 01:11:34.894
- PAUL, WHAT'S YOUR 20?

01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:37.167
- BUSY SETTING CHARGES WE'RE
AT THE OLD KULOA TUNNEL.

01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:38.171
ANY NEWS ON THE GATOR?

01:11:38.174 --> 01:11:39.141
- NOTHING SO FAR.

01:11:39.143 --> 01:11:40.877
I'M HOPING IT
STAYS THAT WAY.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.250
- YOU AND ME BOTH.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:50.666
- OKAY, COME ON, FOLKS.

01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:52.802
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

01:11:54.472 --> 01:11:56.039
ALL RIGHT, GATHER
AROUND, GATHER AROUND.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.607
THANK YOU.

01:11:57.608 --> 01:12:00.277
- NOW THE COCO PALMS
RESORT HAS MANY TRADITIONS.

01:12:00.279 --> 01:12:02.580
ONE OF THEM BEING THE
CEREMONIAL TORCH LIGHTING

01:12:02.581 --> 01:12:05.250
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE CALL TO FEAST.

01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:07.685
EVEN TODAY MANY RESORTS
ON THE ISLAND CHAIN,

01:12:07.687 --> 01:12:09.588
CONTINUE THIS TRADITION.

01:12:09.589 --> 01:12:11.157
- THAT'S GREAT.

01:12:11.158 --> 01:12:13.592
BUT IS THAT THE ELVIS ROOM
YOU TOLD US ABOUT OVER THERE?

01:12:13.594 --> 01:12:14.828
- NO, IT'S NOT.

01:12:14.829 --> 01:12:16.496
THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR IS OVER THERE,

01:12:16.497 --> 01:12:19.232
THE LAST ONE
TO THE RIGHT.

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:21.269
- BOB, LET'S GO
CHECK IT--

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.205
- AH!

01:12:53.473 --> 01:12:55.208
- THERE, THE COCO PALMS.

01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:58.077
I THINK WE GOT TROUBLE.

01:13:03.385 --> 01:13:05.920
THIS IS SWANSON,
COCO PALMS HOTEL.

01:13:05.921 --> 01:13:07.655
GATOR MUST BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

01:13:07.656 --> 01:13:10.225
WE NEED BACK UP
IMMEDIATELY.

01:13:12.395 --> 01:13:14.096
YOU READY FOR THIS?

01:13:14.097 --> 01:13:15.430
- I'M YOUR
DAUGHTER AREN'T I?

01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:16.766
- DAMN RIGHT YOU ARE.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.168
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:19.135
I SHOULD TELL
YOU MORE OFTEN,

01:13:19.136 --> 01:13:20.904
BUT I'M A CRANKY
SON OF A BITCH.

01:13:20.905 --> 01:13:21.872
- DAD...

01:13:21.874 --> 01:13:23.540
- SAVE IT, CAS'.

01:13:23.541 --> 01:13:25.509
WE'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.701
CRAP.

01:14:04.355 --> 01:14:05.923
CAS' TAKE THIS.

01:14:05.925 --> 01:14:07.058
GET IT STARTED.

01:14:07.059 --> 01:14:08.326
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:14:08.327 --> 01:14:09.660
- DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:14:09.661 --> 01:14:11.429
- GIVING IT SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

01:14:11.431 --> 01:14:12.364
- DAD, NO.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.232
DAD, NO, LET'S
GO TO THE CAR.

01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:13.933
- CAS', GET OUTTA HERE.

01:14:13.934 --> 01:14:14.633
- DAD, COME ON.

01:14:14.634 --> 01:14:16.468
- GET OUTTA HERE, NOW!

01:14:21.608 --> 01:14:23.876
HERE'S LOOKING
AT YOU, KID.

01:14:40.664 --> 01:14:41.797
- NO!

01:14:43.969 --> 01:14:46.203
DAD!

01:15:09.198 --> 01:15:11.232
NO.

01:15:12.134 --> 01:15:14.202
DAD.

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:49.876
- I PLANTED SIX
CHARGES, TEN FEET APART.

01:15:49.877 --> 01:15:50.644
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

01:15:50.645 --> 01:15:51.678
I PLANTED FIVE.

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:53.113
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LAST ONE?

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:56.284
- INSURANCE.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:15:59.955
- PAUL, YOU READING ME?

01:15:59.956 --> 01:16:01.390
- CASSIDY WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:02.724
- YOU GOT THOSE
CHARGES READY?

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:03.959
- JUST FINISHING UP NOW, WHY?

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960
- I'M HEADING YOUR WAY

01:16:04.962 --> 01:16:06.963
AND I'M BRINGING
THE GATOR WITH ME.

01:16:06.964 --> 01:16:08.331
- YOU MEAN THAT
THING'S CHASING YOU?

01:16:08.332 --> 01:16:09.132
CAS', DON'T DO THIS.

01:16:09.133 --> 01:16:10.467
GET OFF THE ROAD NOW.

01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:12.135
- MY DAD'S DEAD, PAUL.

01:16:12.137 --> 01:16:14.338
THAT THING KILLED HIM.

01:16:14.339 --> 01:16:15.739
SO NOW I'M GONNA KILL IT.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:16.874
- CAS'--

01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:18.209
- I'LL LEAD THAT
MONSTER INTO THE TUNNEL.

01:16:18.211 --> 01:16:21.113
ONCE I GET IT THERE YOU
LOAD AND BLOW IT BEHIND HIM.

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:25.651
- CAS'?

01:16:25.652 --> 01:16:27.487
CASSIDY, COME IN.

01:16:27.488 --> 01:16:29.089
CASSIDY!

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:31.491
DAMN IT.

01:16:40.869 --> 01:16:43.205
SOUNDS HUNGRY.

01:16:43.207 --> 01:16:45.874
- YOU KNOW IF THAT THING
COMES THIS WAY TOO SOON

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:48.644
IT'S GONNA PUT CASSIDY RIGHT
BETWEEN IT AND THE GATOR.

01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:49.679
- WELL, CASSIDY SAID
TO BLOW THE TUNNEL,

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.381
BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY
FROM WHAT SIDE.

01:16:51.382 --> 01:16:53.283
I'M GOING THROUGH
TO THE OTHER END.

01:16:53.284 --> 01:16:54.918
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP HER
ONCE SHE GETS THE GATOR

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.154
TO THE VALLEY.

01:16:56.155 --> 01:16:59.224
YOU WITH ME?

01:16:59.225 --> 01:17:00.725
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:17:00.726 --> 01:17:02.594
- RIGHT.

01:17:19.214 --> 01:17:21.315
RIGHT THERE,
THERE'S THE FACTORY.

01:17:23.186 --> 01:17:25.354
COME ON, LET'S GO.

01:17:46.946 --> 01:17:49.715
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S IN, DO IT.

01:18:15.913 --> 01:18:17.747
THERE IT IS.

01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:20.651
HE DOESN'T SEE US.

01:18:53.724 --> 01:18:56.325
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:27.162
- YOU OKAY?

01:19:27.163 --> 01:19:29.931
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:35.338
LOOKS LIKE YOU
GOT YOUR WISH.

01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:58.198
- FIGHT'S ALMOST OVER.

01:19:58.199 --> 01:19:59.399
WE SHOULD
HIGHTAIL IT OUTTA HERE.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.867
- NO WAY, NOT ON FOOT.

01:20:00.868 --> 01:20:01.835
THIS IS FLAT GROUND.

01:20:01.836 --> 01:20:02.703
THAT THING WILL
PICK UP OUR SCENT

01:20:02.704 --> 01:20:04.070
AND BE ON US
IN A SECOND.

01:20:04.072 --> 01:20:05.873
- YOU STILL HAVE THAT
EXTRA CHARGE YOU DIDN'T USE?

01:20:05.874 --> 01:20:07.908
- YEAH, YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
ENOUGH TO TAKE THAT DOWN.

01:20:07.909 --> 01:20:08.876
- GIVE IT TO ME.

01:20:08.877 --> 01:20:09.777
- WHY?

01:20:09.779 --> 01:20:11.647
IT'S WORTHLESS.

01:20:12.816 --> 01:20:14.282
- SEE ALL THAT?

01:20:14.283 --> 01:20:16.552
THAT'S CONCENTRATED DUST AND
POWDER SUGAR HANGING IN THE AIR

01:20:16.554 --> 01:20:18.555
WAITING FOR A TINY
SPARK WOULD IGNITE IT.

01:20:18.556 --> 01:20:20.690
THIS IS THE SPARK
WE'RE GONNA NEED.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:22.024
ALL RIGHT--
IT'S DO OR DIE TIME.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:24.127
MAKE SURE YOU HIT THE DECK
WHEN I TOSS THIS THING IN.

01:20:24.128 --> 01:20:25.663
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:20:25.664 --> 01:20:27.465
- SEE THAT TROUGH OUT THERE?

01:20:27.466 --> 01:20:30.434
I'M HOPING THERE'S ENOUGH
RAIN WATER IN IT TO BE SAFE.

01:20:30.436 --> 01:20:32.637
- WHAT IF THERE ISN'T?

01:20:32.638 --> 01:20:35.774
- WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
THEY BURY ME IN THE SHIRT.

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:08.613
- YOU OKAY?

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.981
- YEAH.

01:21:48.025 --> 01:21:50.928
- OH.

01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:53.998
- YOU SURPRISED ME.

01:21:57.838 --> 01:21:59.237
- OH.

01:21:59.238 --> 01:22:00.806
GLAD THAT'S OVER WITH.

01:22:36.304 --> 01:22:38.000
