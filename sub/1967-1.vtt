20:12.336 --> 20:13.711
I know my rights.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.463
I want my phone call.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.216
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

20:19.092 --> 20:20.509
...what good is a phone call...

20:20.761 --> 20:24.347
...if you're unable to speak?

20:58.131 --> 21:00.341
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

21:00.842 --> 21:03.010
...whether you want to or not.

Get in.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.419
What's this?

23:00.670 --> 23:03.214
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.633
- From what?
- From you.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.636
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

23:08.804 --> 23:09.970
Stop the car.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.726
Listen, coppertop.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.978
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.856
Right now, there's only one rule:

23:21.149 --> 23:22.483
Our way...

23:22.818 --> 23:23.901
...or the highway.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.534
Fine.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.871
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.083
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.043
You know that road.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.671
You know exactly where it ends.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.134
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

Try and relax.

Come on.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.469

That thing's real!?

25:27.025 --> 25:28.359
This is it.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.156
Let me give you one piece of advice.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.784
Be honest.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.579
He knows more than you can imagine.

25:49.297 --> 25:50.631
At last.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.259
Welcome, Neo.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.387
As you no doubt have guessed...

25:56.638 --> 25:57.888
...I am Morpheus.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.516
It's an honor to meet you.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.017
No...

26:02.602 --> 26:03.894
...the honor is mine.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.314
Please, come. Sit.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.039
I imagine...

26:24.457 --> 26:27.209
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

26:28.920 --> 26:31.338
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

26:32.173 --> 26:33.257
You could say that.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.802
I can see it in your eyes.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.681
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

26:40.932 --> 26:43.183
...because he's expecting to wake up.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.187
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.274
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

26:50.442 --> 26:51.525
No.

26:51.943 --> 26:52.985
Why not?

26:53.236 --> 26:56.030
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

26:57.115 --> 27:00.451
I know exactly what you mean.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.124
Let me tell you why you're here.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.710
You know something.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.879
What you know,
you can't explain.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.964
But you feel it.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.467
You felt it your entire life:

27:17.052 --> 27:21.221
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.932
Like a splinter in your mind...

27:24.184 --> 27:26.060
...driving you mad.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.730
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.109
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

27:35.945 --> 27:37.279
The Matrix?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.450
Do you want to know...

27:41.910 --> 27:43.911
...what it is?

27:46.289 --> 27:48.165
The Matrix is everywhere.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.125
It is all around us.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.336
Even now, in this very room.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.381
You can see it when you
look out your window...

27:55.632 --> 27:57.966
...or when you turn on your television.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.928
You can feel it when you go to work...

28:02.472 --> 28:04.139
...when you go to church...

28:04.557 --> 28:06.642
...when you pay your taxes.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.688
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

28:10.939 --> 28:12.523
...to blind you from the truth.

28:14.734 --> 28:15.984
What truth?

28:20.240 --> 28:21.782
That you are a slave.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.577
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

28:25.829 --> 28:30.499
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.084
A prison...

28:32.335 --> 28:33.460
...for your mind.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.803
Unfortunately, no one can be...

28:43.138 --> 28:45.514
...told what the Matrix is.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.853
You have to see it for yourself.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.656
This is your last chance.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.242
After this, there is no turning back.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.161
You take the blue pill...

29:07.495 --> 29:10.539
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

29:10.790 --> 29:12.583
...whatever you want to believe.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.168
You take the red pill...

29:14.419 --> 29:16.378
...you stay in Wonderland...

29:16.880 --> 29:19.590
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.684
Remember...

29:31.519 --> 29:34.563
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.204
Follow me.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.416

30:27.325 --> 30:29.326
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

30:30.078 --> 30:34.706
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.291
What does that mean?

30:36.876 --> 30:39.044
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

30:39.379 --> 30:40.712
...because Kansas...

30:40.964 --> 30:42.005
...is going bye-bye.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.295
Did you...?

31:32.307 --> 31:36.393
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

31:37.854 --> 31:40.439
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

31:40.690 --> 31:43.191
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

31:43.818 --> 31:45.235
...and the real world?

31:46.863 --> 31:48.030

- Apoc?

Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

32:08.509 --> 32:11.178
- I got a fibrillation.

- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

35:24.455 --> 35:25.997

- I hope you're right.
<font color="#808080">MORPHEUS :</font> I don't have to hope.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.211

35:37.927 --> 35:40.095
Far from it.

What are you doing?

35:58.364 --> 36:00.574
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.701
Why do my eyes hurt?

36:03.411 --> 36:05.287
You've never used them before.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.083

What is this place?

37:30.122 --> 37:32.791
More important than "what" is "when."

37:33.292 --> 37:34.334
"When"?

37:34.543 --> 37:36.586
You believe it's the year 1999...

37:36.837 --> 37:39.089
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.968
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

37:43.219 --> 37:44.844
...because we honestly don't know.

37:45.346 --> 37:48.181
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

37:48.432 --> 37:51.184
Come with me.
See for yourself.

Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.649
The little one behind you is Mouse.

38:43.988 --> 38:47.240
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

Trinity.

Try to relax.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.813
This will feel a little weird.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.160
This...

39:32.328 --> 39:34.037
...is the Construct.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.581
It's our loading program.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.919
...to equipment...

39:41.212 --> 39:42.545
...weapons...

39:43.172 --> 39:45.006

Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.773
Your hair has changed.

40:02.149 --> 40:05.485
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

40:06.195 --> 40:08.822
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

40:14.703 --> 40:15.829
This isn't real?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.622
What is "real"?

40:17.998 --> 40:20.250
How do you define "real"?

40:20.543 --> 40:22.460
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

40:22.711 --> 40:25.130
...what you can smell, taste and see...

40:25.381 --> 40:29.259
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.849
This is the world that you know.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.311
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

40:42.690 --> 40:47.026
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

40:47.278 --> 40:48.528
...that we call the Matrix.

40:53.075 --> 40:55.869
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

40:56.871 --> 40:57.996
This is the world...

40:58.289 --> 41:00.039
...as it exists today.

41:13.095 --> 41:16.055
Welcome to "the desert...

41:16.932 --> 41:18.516
...of the real."

41:21.896 --> 41:24.272
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

41:24.523 --> 41:28.318
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

41:28.569 --> 41:31.821
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

41:32.072 --> 41:36.826
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.745
AI.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.164
You mean artificial intelligence.

41:41.415 --> 41:45.835
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

41:46.670 --> 41:50.131
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

41:50.549 --> 41:53.760
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

41:55.429 --> 41:57.597
They were dependent on solar power...

41:57.848 --> 42:01.184
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

42:01.519 --> 42:05.021
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

42:05.272 --> 42:10.151
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

42:11.612 --> 42:15.823
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

42:19.036 --> 42:23.456
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

42:23.707 --> 42:27.835
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.923
Combined with a form of fusion...

42:32.258 --> 42:37.095
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

42:41.141 --> 42:44.894
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

42:45.145 --> 42:48.398
...where human beings
are no longer born.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.942
We are grown.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.576
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

42:59.827 --> 43:02.495
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

43:03.831 --> 43:05.456
...watched them liquefy the dead...

43:05.708 --> 43:09.043
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

43:09.587 --> 43:13.840
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

43:14.091 --> 43:17.010
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.431
What is the Matrix?

43:22.641 --> 43:23.683
Control.

43:25.060 --> 43:28.438
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

43:29.231 --> 43:32.317
...built to keep us under control...

43:33.485 --> 43:36.654
...in order to change a human being...

43:37.281 --> 43:38.448
...into this.

43:39.825 --> 43:40.950
No.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.162
I don't believe it.

43:44.538 --> 43:45.747
It's not possible.

43:46.332 --> 43:50.918
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.462
Stop!

43:53.005 --> 43:54.213
Let me out!

43:54.923 --> 43:56.841
Let me out! I want out!

43:58.802 --> 44:01.471
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.389
Get this thing out of me!

44:05.184 --> 44:06.684
Don't touch me!

44:06.935 --> 44:08.561
Stay away from me!

44:08.979 --> 44:10.480
I don't believe it.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.398
I don't believe it.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.150
I don't believe it.

44:14.401 --> 44:16.444
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.904
Just breathe.

44:36.298 --> 44:38.091
I can't go back, can I?

44:38.926 --> 44:40.343
No.

44:41.178 --> 44:42.387
But if you could...

44:43.222 --> 44:44.722
...would you really want to?

44:47.226 --> 44:48.601
I owe you an apology.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.561
We have a rule.

44:51.021 --> 44:54.273
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.525
It's dangerous.

44:56.235 --> 44:57.944
The mind has trouble letting go.

44:58.195 --> 45:00.488
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.616
I did what I did because...

45:04.326 --> 45:05.785
...I had to.

45:14.211 --> 45:18.297
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

45:18.799 --> 45:22.593
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

45:22.970 --> 45:25.888
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

45:27.641 --> 45:31.102
It was he who freed the first of us...

45:31.979 --> 45:33.604
...taught us the truth.

45:35.065 --> 45:38.151
As long as the Matrix exists...

45:38.485 --> 45:40.570
...the human race will never be free.

45:44.783 --> 45:46.325
After he died...

45:47.077 --> 45:49.787
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

45:50.330 --> 45:53.541
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

45:53.792 --> 45:55.460
...end the war...

45:55.794 --> 45:57.044
...bring freedom to our people.

45:58.380 --> 46:03.009
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

46:03.343 --> 46:04.927
...Iooking for him.

46:07.347 --> 46:09.432
I did what I did because...

46:11.059 --> 46:13.186
...I believe that search is over.

46:18.275 --> 46:19.692
Get some rest.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.111
You're going to need it.

46:24.823 --> 46:25.865
For what?

46:28.911 --> 46:30.119
Your training.

46:48.430 --> 46:50.139
Morning. Did you sleep?

46:51.016 --> 46:52.225
You will tonight.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.143
I guarantee it.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.563
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

46:58.023 --> 47:00.441
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

47:01.360 --> 47:06.072
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.532
Born free right here...

47:08.075 --> 47:09.408
...in the real world.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.327
Genuine child of Zion.

47:12.162 --> 47:14.622
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

47:14.873 --> 47:16.374
...Zion's where the party would be.

47:16.792 --> 47:18.084
It's a city?

47:18.335 --> 47:21.504
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.340
Where is it?

47:26.093 --> 47:29.512
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

47:31.139 --> 47:33.015
You live long enough,
you might see it.

47:35.269 --> 47:40.106
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

47:40.357 --> 47:42.108
...if Morpheus is right and all.

47:42.609 --> 47:45.361
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

47:45.612 --> 47:47.029
...if you are...

47:48.115 --> 47:50.116
...it's a very exciting time.

47:51.159 --> 47:53.870
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

47:57.791 --> 48:00.710
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

48:01.712 --> 48:05.172
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

48:05.507 --> 48:06.966
How about...

48:08.552 --> 48:10.303
...combat training?

48:16.351 --> 48:17.810
"Jujitsu"?

48:18.687 --> 48:20.354
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

48:31.700 --> 48:32.909
Holy shit!

48:33.160 --> 48:35.494
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

48:35.829 --> 48:37.121
How about some more?

48:37.372 --> 48:38.664
Hell, yes.

48:40.751 --> 48:41.792
Hell, yeah.

48:53.972 --> 48:55.056
How is he?

48:55.307 --> 48:57.475
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

49:08.695 --> 49:10.071
I know kung fu.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.740
Show me.

49:14.534 --> 49:16.285
This is a sparring program...

49:16.536 --> 49:19.330
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

49:19.581 --> 49:21.916
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

49:22.167 --> 49:25.628
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

49:26.171 --> 49:27.672
Some of them can be bent.

49:27.881 --> 49:30.341
Others can be broken.

49:30.884 --> 49:31.968
Understand?

49:33.053 --> 49:34.095
Then hit me...

49:34.680 --> 49:35.805
...if you can.

50:14.803 --> 50:15.845
Good!

50:16.596 --> 50:17.763
Adaptation.

50:18.056 --> 50:19.265
Improvisation.

50:19.558 --> 50:20.891
But your weakness...

50:21.143 --> 50:22.518
...is not your technique.

50:29.484 --> 50:31.569
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

51:43.850 --> 51:45.017
How did I beat you?

51:51.608 --> 51:52.691
You're too fast.

51:53.235 --> 51:54.568
Do you believe that...

51:54.945 --> 51:57.446
...my being stronger or faster...

51:57.697 --> 52:01.367
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

52:05.413 --> 52:07.206
You think you're breathing air?

52:20.720 --> 52:21.929
Again!

52:33.400 --> 52:35.818
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

52:36.069 --> 52:38.279
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

52:43.743 --> 52:45.202
What are you waiting for?

52:45.453 --> 52:47.413
You're faster than this.

52:49.624 --> 52:51.834
Don't think you are.

52:52.085 --> 52:53.752
Know you are.

53:04.139 --> 53:06.932
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

53:16.860 --> 53:18.611
I don't believe it.

53:20.155 --> 53:22.281
I know what you're trying to do.

53:23.950 --> 53:26.118
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.537
But I can only show you the door.

53:29.122 --> 53:30.956
You have to walk through it.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.461
Tank, load the jump program.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.767
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

53:50.310 --> 53:52.478
...doubt and disbelief.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.357
Free your mind.

54:04.616 --> 54:05.741
Whoa.

54:12.540 --> 54:14.250
Okey-dokey.

54:16.336 --> 54:17.503
Free my mind.

54:17.963 --> 54:19.088
What if he makes it?

54:19.339 --> 54:22.049
- No one's ever made their first jump.
<font color="#808080">MOUSE :</font> I know.

54:23.385 --> 54:25.844
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

54:26.429 --> 54:27.513
Come on.

54:27.764 --> 54:28.931
All right.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.433
No problem. Free my mind.

54:32.227 --> 54:35.020
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

54:54.416 --> 54:56.083
What does that mean?

54:56.459 --> 54:58.294
It doesn't mean anything.

54:58.878 --> 55:01.463
Everybody falls the first time.

55:01.923 --> 55:03.215
Right, Trin?

55:23.903 --> 55:26.530
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

55:29.784 --> 55:32.036
If you're killed in the Matrix...

55:32.203 --> 55:33.245
...you die here?

55:33.872 --> 55:36.332
The body cannot live without the mind.

56:06.821 --> 56:10.199
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

56:13.286 --> 56:16.121
There is something about him,
isn't there?

56:16.748 --> 56:18.374
You're a believer now?

56:19.376 --> 56:20.584
I keep wondering...

56:20.835 --> 56:24.505
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

56:25.423 --> 56:28.342
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

56:38.144 --> 56:39.686
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

56:41.439 --> 56:42.731
That system is our enemy.

56:43.358 --> 56:45.692
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

56:45.944 --> 56:49.738
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

56:50.198 --> 56:52.783
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

56:53.034 --> 56:55.994
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

56:56.246 --> 56:58.163
...and that makes them our enemy.

56:58.331 --> 56:59.540
You have to understand...

56:59.791 --> 57:03.127
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

57:03.378 --> 57:04.962
And many of them are so inert...

57:05.213 --> 57:07.631
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

57:07.882 --> 57:10.592
...that they will fight to protect it.

57:12.095 --> 57:15.848
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

57:16.015 --> 57:17.766
- I was...
- Look again.

57:19.018 --> 57:20.102
Freeze it.

57:26.734 --> 57:28.360
<font color="#808080">NEO :</font> This isn't the Matrix?
<font color="#808080">MORPHEUS :</font> No.

57:30.155 --> 57:33.991
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

57:34.617 --> 57:37.035
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

57:37.579 --> 57:40.372
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

57:41.124 --> 57:45.419
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

57:45.795 --> 57:49.173
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

57:49.507 --> 57:50.841
...is potentially an agent.

57:51.801 --> 57:53.635
Inside the Matrix...

57:54.220 --> 57:55.929
...they are everyone...

57:56.264 --> 57:57.973
...and they are no one.

57:58.224 --> 58:01.351
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

58:01.603 --> 58:03.228
...but they are the gatekeepers.

58:03.480 --> 58:06.440
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

58:06.691 --> 58:09.526
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

58:09.694 --> 58:10.903
Someone?

58:11.237 --> 58:12.654
<font color="#808080">MORPHEUS :</font>
I won't lie to you, Neo.

58:13.114 --> 58:17.951
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

58:18.203 --> 58:20.579
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

58:20.747 --> 58:21.830
Why?

58:22.081 --> 58:24.374
<font color="#808080">MORPHEUS :</font> I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

58:24.626 --> 58:28.212
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

58:28.463 --> 58:33.091
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

58:33.343 --> 58:34.468
Because of that...

58:34.719 --> 58:38.096
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

58:42.393 --> 58:44.269
What are you telling me?

58:44.979 --> 58:46.438
That I can dodge bullets?

58:48.441 --> 58:49.816
No, Neo.

58:50.318 --> 58:53.237
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

58:54.113 --> 58:55.447
...you won't have to.

58:56.783 --> 58:58.283

59:19.722 --> 59:22.182
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

Shit.

59:26.980 --> 59:29.856
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

59:30.066 --> 59:33.277
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

59:33.528 --> 59:34.736
Search and destroy.

59:36.072 --> 59:37.239
Set her down there.

59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.012
How are we doing, Tank?

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.896
Power off-line.

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:12.357
EMP armed...

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.443
- ...and ready.
- EMP?

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.612
Electromagnetic pulse.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.740
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:22.200
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:31.126
<font color="#808080">NEO :</font> Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:33.503
Sewers.

<font color="#808080">TRINITY :</font> There used to be cities

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:38.842

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:40.427
Quiet.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.469
Whoa! Neo.

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:26.473
You scared the bejesus out of me.

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:29.476
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.230
Is that...?

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.065
The Matrix?

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.441
Yeah.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:41.405
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:44.741
The image translators work
for the construct program.

01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:48.412
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:51.623
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:55.293
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:57.838
Do you...

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.214
...want a drink?

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:00.507
Sure.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.512
You know...

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.973
...I know what you're thinking.

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.308
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:13.979
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.900
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:30.704
<font color="#D900D9">(COUGHS)</font>

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.206
Good shit, huh?

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:34.750
Dozer makes it.

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:36.376
It's good for two things:

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:39.713
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.924
So can I ask you something?

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.554
Did he tell you why he did it?

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.017
Why you're here?

01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:57.439
Jesus!

01:02:58.649 --> 01:03:00.567
What a mind job.

01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:04.780
So you're here to save the world.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:08.366
What do you say
to something like that?

01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:14.915
A little piece of advice.

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:18.126
You see an agent...

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.754
...you do what we do:

01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:22.631
Run.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.716
You run your ass off.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.683
Thanks for the drink.

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:39.564
Sweet dreams.

01:03:43.569 --> 01:03:46.988
<font color="#808080">SMITH :</font>
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.782
You know...

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.661
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.414
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.751
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:01.169
...juicy...

01:04:01.462 --> 01:04:03.171
...and delicious.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:07.342
After nine years...

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.928
...you know what I realize?

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:18.979
Ignorance is bliss.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.861
Then we have a deal.

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:30.282
I don't want to remember nothing.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.034
Nothing. You understand?

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:38.915
And I want to be rich.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.961
You know, someone important.

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:45.589
Like an actor.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:49.926
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:53.638
Okay.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.433
You get my body
back in a power plant...

01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:58.560
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.312
...I'll get you what you want.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.564
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:04.983
No. I told you, I don't know them.

01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:09.946
I can get you the man who does.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.490
Morpheus.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:26.046
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:30.175
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:32.093
Or a bowl of snot.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:34.220
<font color="#808080">MOUSE :</font>
You know what it reminds me of?

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:38.391
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:40.727
No, but technically,
neither did you.

01:05:40.978 --> 01:05:43.021
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:44.648
Because you have to wonder...

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:48.151
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

01:05:48.402 --> 01:05:49.819
Maybe they got it wrong.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:53.281
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.575
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.787
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.039
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.333
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:05.377
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:08.463
<font color="#808080">DOZER :</font>
It's a single-celled protein...

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:11.758

Everything the body needs.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:16.388
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:22.227
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.313
You know, I wrote that program.

01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:26.898
Here it comes.

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.109
<font color="#808080">MOUSE :</font> What did you think of her?
<font color="#808080">NEO :</font> Of who?

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.529
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:35.615
She doesn't talk very much...

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:39.828
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.454
The digital pimp hard at work.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.957
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.085
To deny our own impulses...

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:50.463
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:53.758
Dozer, when you're done...

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.552
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.470
We're going in.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.597
I'm taking Neo to see her.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:04.769
See who?

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:07.022
The Oracle.

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.070
Everyone please observe...

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:17.115
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:20.994
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.062
I used to eat there.

01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:32.941
Really good noodles.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:40.240
I have these memories from my life.

01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:44.368
None of them happened.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.328
What does that mean?

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.790
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

01:08:49.707 --> 01:08:50.917
But an oracle can?

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:52.585
That's different.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.550
Did you go to her?

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:01.261
<font color="#808080">TRINITY :</font>
Yes.

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:03.138
What did she tell you?

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:07.892
She told me...

01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:10.103
What?

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.233
<font color="#808080">MORPHEUS :</font>
We're here.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.902
Neo, come with me.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.300
So is this the same oracle
that made...

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:41.718
...the prophecy?

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:46.305
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.765
<font color="#808080">NEO :</font> The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.395
And she knows what? Everything?

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:57.358
She would say she knows enough.

01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:00.278
And she's never wrong.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:05.658
<font color="#808080">MORPHEUS :</font> Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:07.577
She is a guide, Neo.

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:09.829
She can help you to find the path.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:11.581
She helped you?

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.333
Yes.

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:15.418
What did she tell you?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.089
That I would find the One.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.355
I told you I can only
show you the door.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.149
You have to walk through it.

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.029
Hello, Neo.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.948
You're right on time.

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:56.668
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.925
These are the other Potentials.

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:05.718
You can wait here.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:49.095
BOY:
Do not try and bend the spoon.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.597
That's impossible.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:56.436
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.354
What truth?

01:11:58.605 --> 01:12:00.273
There is no spoon.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.193
There is no spoon?

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:08.906
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

01:12:24.965 --> 01:12:26.424
The Oracle will you see now.

01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:38.686
<font color="#808080">ORACLE :</font>

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:40.480

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.900
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:49.489
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.700
Almost done.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.829
Smell good, don't they?

01:12:58.082 --> 01:12:59.332
Yeah.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.417
<font color="#808080">ORACLE :</font>
I'd ask you to sit down...

01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:04.045
...but you're not going to anyway.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:07.423
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:11.719
That vase.

01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:13.721
I'm sorry.

01:13:13.972 --> 01:13:15.848
I said, don't worry about it.

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:18.976
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

01:13:19.603 --> 01:13:20.812
How did you know?

01:13:22.856 --> 01:13:26.651
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:29.946
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.661
You're cuter than I thought.

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:41.958
I can see why she likes you.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:43.918
Who?

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.003
Not too bright, though.

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:52.385
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:55.680
So...

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.015
...what do you think?

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.602
Do you think you are the One?

01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:04.605
I don't know.

01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:09.444
You know what that means?

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.446
It's Latin.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:14.031
Means, "Know thyself."

01:14:15.492 --> 01:14:17.452
I'll let you in on a little secret.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:23.541
Being the One is just
like being in love.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:27.128
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

01:14:27.379 --> 01:14:28.504
...through and through.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.882
Balls to bones.

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:34.260
Well...

01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:38.306
...I'd better have a look at you.

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.142
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

01:14:55.532 --> 01:14:57.200
Okay...

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:02.788
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.415
Then you say:

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.292
But what?

01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:10.505
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.884
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.513
You got the gift...

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:21.724
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:27.438
What?

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:30.566
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.402
That's the way these things go.

01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:36.864
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:42.036
He almost had me convinced.

01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:43.412
I know.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:47.083
Poor Morpheus.

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:52.588
Without him, we're lost.

01:15:54.132 --> 01:15:56.300
What do you mean, "without him"?

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:02.223
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:07.186
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.065
And no one, not you, not even me...

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:13.568
...can convince him otherwise.

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:16.320
He believes it so blindly...

01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:20.950
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

...human beings define
their reality through misery...

01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:34.923
...and suffering.

01:32:35.174 --> 01:32:37.884
So the perfect world was a dream...

01:32:38.135 --> 01:32:42.973
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

01:32:44.308 --> 01:32:47.978
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

01:32:48.437 --> 01:32:49.938
The peak...

01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:51.606
...of your civilization.

01:32:51.857 --> 01:32:54.109
I say, "your civilization"...

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.488
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:01.825
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.745
Evolution, Morpheus.

01:33:06.038 --> 01:33:07.372
Evolution.

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:11.543
Like the dinosaur.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:15.338
Look out that window.

01:33:16.048 --> 01:33:18.174
You had your time.

01:33:18.884 --> 01:33:22.804
The future is our world, Morpheus.

01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:25.515
The future is our time.

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:30.937
There could be a problem.

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:35.233
<font color="#808080">NEO :</font> What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

01:33:35.484 --> 01:33:37.652
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

01:33:37.903 --> 01:33:39.112
How much time?

01:33:39.363 --> 01:33:42.490
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

01:33:42.742 --> 01:33:47.162
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

01:33:47.413 --> 01:33:50.373
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:51.666
What do they want?

01:33:51.917 --> 01:33:55.962
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

01:33:56.213 --> 01:33:59.132
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

01:33:59.383 --> 01:34:02.469
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:04.888
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:06.222
...or you...

01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:07.682
...or even Morpheus.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.146
There has to be
something we can do.

01:34:13.564 --> 01:34:15.565
There is. We pull the plug.

01:34:18.653 --> 01:34:20.403
You're going to kill him?

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:21.821
Kill Morpheus?

01:34:22.448 --> 01:34:24.074
We don't have a choice.

01:34:30.873 --> 01:34:33.792
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

01:34:34.043 --> 01:34:35.794
If the insider has failed...

01:34:36.045 --> 01:34:39.255
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:41.216
They're dead. In either case...

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:45.011
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

01:34:45.262 --> 01:34:46.346
Immediately.

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:54.270
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:57.440
You were a father.

01:34:58.984 --> 01:35:00.944
We'll miss you always.

01:35:07.827 --> 01:35:09.035
Stop!

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.538
I don't believe this is happening.

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:13.748
- Neo, this has to be done.
<font color="#808080">NEO :</font> Does it?

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:15.917
I don't know.

01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:18.712
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:20.171
<font color="#808080">NEO :</font>
The Oracle.

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:22.215
She told me this would happen.

01:35:22.633 --> 01:35:26.803
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:28.471
What choice?

01:35:31.475 --> 01:35:33.977
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

01:35:34.311 --> 01:35:36.646
<font color="#808080">TRINITY :</font> No, you're not.
- I have to.

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:40.483
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.652
There is no way
that you're going back in.

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:46.489
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:49.033
What?

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.369
I'm not the One, Trinity.

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:54.706
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

01:35:54.957 --> 01:35:57.625
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

01:35:58.294 --> 01:35:59.544
No, Neo, that's not true.

01:36:00.129 --> 01:36:02.756
- It can't be true.
- Why?

01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:10.513
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:15.143
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:20.356
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.192
That's what it looks like...

01:36:22.359 --> 01:36:23.401
...but it's not.

01:36:23.652 --> 01:36:26.029
I can't explain to you why it's not.

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:30.825
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:34.078
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

01:36:34.371 --> 01:36:36.873
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:38.666
What?

01:36:39.376 --> 01:36:41.085
I believe I can bring him back.

01:36:58.062 --> 01:36:59.979
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

01:37:00.272 --> 01:37:02.273
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

01:37:03.442 --> 01:37:05.568
Let me tell you what I believe.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:08.446
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:13.076
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:15.370
And since I am the ranking officer...

01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:18.498
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.668
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:23.628
Tank...

01:37:23.796 --> 01:37:24.921
...Ioad us up.

01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:37.851
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:39.811
...during my time here.

01:37:40.062 --> 01:37:44.065
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

01:37:44.316 --> 01:37:46.568
...and I realized...

01:37:46.819 --> 01:37:49.112
...that you're not actually mammals.

01:37:51.323 --> 01:37:53.783
Every mammal on this planet...

01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:59.038
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:01.124
But you humans do not.

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:05.211
You move to an area
and you multiply...

01:38:05.462 --> 01:38:09.966
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:12.385
The only way you can survive...

01:38:12.678 --> 01:38:15.638
...is to spread to another area.

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:23.938
There is another organism
on this planet...

01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:26.149
...that follows the same pattern.

01:38:26.775 --> 01:38:28.443
Do you know what it is?

01:38:28.819 --> 01:38:30.653
A virus.

01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:35.033
Human beings are a disease.

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.951
A cancer of this planet.

01:38:37.202 --> 01:38:39.329
You are a plague.

01:38:39.872 --> 01:38:41.289
And we...

01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:42.832
...are the cure.

01:38:43.834 --> 01:38:45.251
Okay, so what do you need?

01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:47.003
Besides a miracle.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:48.796
Guns.

01:38:49.632 --> 01:38:50.840
Lots of guns.

01:39:00.726 --> 01:39:01.935
Neo...

01:39:03.687 --> 01:39:06.230
No one has ever done
anything like this.

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:09.359
That's why it's going to work.

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:15.365
Why isn't the serum working?

01:39:15.991 --> 01:39:18.284
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:21.621
Leave me with him.

01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:25.333
Now.

01:39:36.553 --> 01:39:38.137
<font color="#808080">TANK :</font>
Hold on, Morpheus.

01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:41.099
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:45.603
<font color="#808080">SMITH :</font>
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

01:39:45.854 --> 01:39:48.523
I'm going to be honest...

01:39:48.899 --> 01:39:50.108
...with you.

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:55.905
I...

01:39:56.782 --> 01:39:57.907
...hate...

01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:00.118
...this place...

01:40:00.452 --> 01:40:02.745
...this zoo...

01:40:02.997 --> 01:40:04.122
...this prison...

01:40:04.373 --> 01:40:07.542
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

01:40:07.793 --> 01:40:10.086
I can't stand it any longer.

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.714
It's the smell.

01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:15.967
If there is such a thing.

01:40:16.301 --> 01:40:19.595
I feel saturated by it.

01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:22.390
I can...

01:40:22.641 --> 01:40:24.183
...taste...

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:26.394
...your stink.

01:40:26.645 --> 01:40:30.273
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:31.441
It's repulsive.

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:33.818
Isn't it?

01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:38.281
I must get out of here.

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:40.908
I must get free.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.037
And in this mind is the key.

01:40:44.288 --> 01:40:45.955
My key.

01:40:46.206 --> 01:40:49.083
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

01:40:49.334 --> 01:40:50.960
Do you understand?

01:40:51.253 --> 01:40:52.628
I need the codes.

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.214
I have to get inside Zion...

01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:58.051
...and you have to tell me how.

01:40:58.469 --> 01:41:00.344
You're going to tell me...

01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:02.764
...or you're going to die.

01:41:22.951 --> 01:41:26.079
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.042
Holy shit!

01:41:43.138 --> 01:41:45.848
Backup. Send backup.

01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:10.790
Freeze!

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:26.842
What were you doing?

01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:29.971
He doesn't know.

01:44:30.222 --> 01:44:31.722
Know what?

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:02.295
I think they're trying to save him.

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:18.894
There is no spoon.

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:50.676
Find them and destroy them!

01:45:52.304 --> 01:45:54.138
We're under attack!

01:46:26.254 --> 01:46:27.421
Trinity!

01:46:27.923 --> 01:46:29.006
Help!

01:46:51.029 --> 01:46:52.238
Only human.

01:46:53.198 --> 01:46:54.281
Dodge this.

01:47:07.504 --> 01:47:09.004
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

01:47:09.423 --> 01:47:13.342
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

01:47:14.469 --> 01:47:15.845
It wasn't fast enough.

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:19.890
Can you fly that thing?

01:47:21.017 --> 01:47:22.017
Not yet.

01:47:25.313 --> 01:47:26.355
Operator.

01:47:26.565 --> 01:47:29.733
<i><font color="#808080">TRINITY :</font> I need a pilot program

01:47:39.411 --> 01:47:41.036
Let's go.

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:57.219
No.

01:48:48.813 --> 01:48:51.440
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

01:49:29.479 --> 01:49:30.521
He's not going to make it.

01:49:40.323 --> 01:49:41.365
Got you.

01:50:47.432 --> 01:50:48.599
Trinity!

01:51:30.266 --> 01:51:31.684
I knew it.

01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:33.519
He's the One.

01:51:49.494 --> 01:51:51.704
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

01:51:54.582 --> 01:51:55.749
Morpheus...

01:51:57.419 --> 01:51:58.502
The Oracle.

01:51:59.754 --> 01:52:02.131
- She told me...
- She told you...

01:52:02.507 --> 01:52:04.091
...what you needed to hear.

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:05.718
That's all.

01:52:06.761 --> 01:52:09.722
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:12.349
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

01:52:13.101 --> 01:52:14.393
...and walking the path.

01:52:17.439 --> 01:52:18.647
<i>- Operator.

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:22.109

- We need an exit.</i>

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:25.154
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:40.627
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

01:52:40.879 --> 01:52:44.465
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

01:52:46.176 --> 01:52:47.676
Order the strike.

01:52:54.225 --> 01:52:56.226
They're not out yet.

<font color="#D900D9">(PHONE RINGS)</font>

01:53:07.405 --> 01:53:08.739
You first, Morpheus.

01:53:29.427 --> 01:53:31.720
Neo, I want to tell you something...

01:53:34.974 --> 01:53:38.936
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.
