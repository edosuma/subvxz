WEBVTT

00:09.991 --> 00:11.509
There we are.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.959
Mmm. I went to Corfu Town yesterday,
and they've swept it.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.317
They've swept it?

00:32.317 --> 00:33.955
Mmm. For the visit
of the King of Greece.

00:33.956 --> 00:37.949
Oh, so that's why they were washing
the trees.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.307
Washing the trees?

00:39.308 --> 00:41.943
You want to make the place look nice
for your monarch, don't you?

00:41.944 --> 00:46.935
The last king,
his brother was killed by monkey.

00:46.936 --> 00:48.932
Hah! You see!

00:48.933 --> 00:49.932
It's an important visit

00:49.933 --> 00:52.926
because King George can help restore
national pride

00:52.927 --> 00:54.924
and stiffen resolve
against Germany and Italy.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.756
I know things.

00:59.757 --> 01:00.914
I just don't shout about them.

01:00.915 --> 01:03.590
God, I sound like Margo.

01:03.591 --> 01:05.907
At last, we are back
in the locals' good books,

01:05.908 --> 01:07.904
so let's help with the celebrations.

01:07.905 --> 01:09.901
Theo's part of some welcoming committee.

01:09.902 --> 01:12.737
Mmm-hmm,
yeah, I-I'm a committed royalist.

01:12.738 --> 01:14.894
Love a queen, so I'll do my bit.

01:15.893 --> 01:17.889
Good morning, Durrells.

01:17.890 --> 01:19.926
Oh! Morning, Spiros. Sleep well?

01:19.927 --> 01:24.878
Yes, despite a goat with a cough
finding its way up into the attic.

01:24.879 --> 01:29.871
Then the weasels sat on my face.

01:29.872 --> 01:30.870
Lemurs.

01:30.871 --> 01:32.866
Sorry, darling,
but Spiros is working hard

01:32.867 --> 01:34.384
building your animal enclosures.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.861
Course, ideally, they'd all just roam.

01:36.862 --> 01:41.853
Yeah, then ideally we'd hunt them
down with my Lee-Enfield

01:41.854 --> 01:43.052
and put them in a pie.

01:46.847 --> 01:50.840
Where shall I leave my laundry?
Oh, I'll take it, thank you.

01:50.841 --> 01:54.834
That's how romance rubs off,
exchange of used underwear.

01:54.835 --> 01:56.831
There is no romance.

01:56.832 --> 01:57.870
It's a practical arrangement.

02:09.812 --> 02:11.808
This is good, isn't it?

02:11.809 --> 02:13.805
Yes.

02:13.806 --> 02:16.801
So why do I keep thinking
something will go wrong?

02:16.802 --> 02:19.796
Have you talked to your wife?

02:19.797 --> 02:21.793
No. She's a mystery to me.

02:21.794 --> 02:23.631
At first, mystery is nice.

02:23.632 --> 02:24.789
Then not.

02:24.790 --> 02:28.784
Well, safe to say
we're over the mystery stage.

02:29.782 --> 02:32.778
Actually, you can do it.

03:21.705 --> 03:23.702
ANNOUNCEMENT OVER TANNOY

03:31.690 --> 03:33.687
CHATTER

03:48.665 --> 03:51.020
Good day.
Bonjour.

03:51.021 --> 03:53.338
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

03:55.654 --> 03:57.650
Buongiorno?

03:57.651 --> 04:00.647
Si. Buongiorno, signorina.

04:01.645 --> 04:02.644
Guten tag.

04:08.635 --> 04:10.632
Kalimera.

04:12.629 --> 04:14.626
How delightfully European.

04:22.294 --> 04:24.611
TRAIN WHISTLE

04:31.600 --> 04:33.596
So, Basil, we've agreed...

04:33.597 --> 04:36.592
that you're going to stop
your doodah with Spiros' wife.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.269
Well, I've had a think.

04:38.270 --> 04:40.586
And... no.

04:40.587 --> 04:43.582
What?! Oh, come on, Basil!

04:43.583 --> 04:47.577
No, I'm... addicted to love.

04:49.574 --> 04:51.570
But I'd rather not be killed by Spiros,

04:51.571 --> 04:53.087
I've seen his sledgehammer,

04:53.088 --> 04:54.565
so very happy to keep it quiet.

04:54.566 --> 04:57.760
No, no, I'm hopeless at keeping secrets.

04:57.761 --> 05:00.556
I'm not very good either, so
we'll both have to raise our game.

05:00.557 --> 05:03.232
Dimitra and I
are being very discreet now.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.549
Spiros and my mother obviously
love spending time together.

05:05.550 --> 05:10.541
Let's hope he stops caring
what his wife's up to.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.538
But I'm VERY disappointed!

05:12.539 --> 05:15.534
If Spiros finds out
you're sleeping with his wife,

05:15.535 --> 05:17.531
all of this niceness will end.

05:17.532 --> 05:18.530
It's your fault.

05:18.531 --> 05:22.523
You more or less frog-marched me
into Dimitra's lovely lap.

05:22.524 --> 05:23.523
Apart from anything,

05:23.524 --> 05:26.517
since Larry's left, I'm supposed
to be mother's confidant,

05:26.518 --> 05:27.517
but I can't tell her anything.

05:30.193 --> 05:32.868
Basil's looking
pleased with himself these days.

05:32.869 --> 05:35.505
Has he found a lady friend?

05:36.503 --> 05:39.499
I hope so.
That'll make life so much simpler.

05:40.697 --> 05:43.493
Well, put your glad-rags on.
We're off.

05:55.475 --> 05:57.472
THEY ALL ARGUE IN GREEK

06:06.459 --> 06:08.455
Shh, shh.

06:08.456 --> 06:11.450
And now in English,
for Mrs, and Leslie Durrell.

06:11.451 --> 06:14.446
Sitting there beautifully. Quietly.

06:14.447 --> 06:17.441
The Royal ship
will sail past their house,

06:17.442 --> 06:21.435
so let's have some sort of display
from there,

06:21.436 --> 06:24.111
which the very creative Durrells
will come up with.

06:24.112 --> 06:26.787
Well, we did have an
Indian Prince at the house once,

06:26.788 --> 06:30.423
and it has been said,
I'm a bit of a princess.

06:35.415 --> 06:37.411
I'll cook something.

06:37.412 --> 06:40.247
And I'm an ex-policeman,
so could be an elite bodyguard.

06:40.248 --> 06:41.405
Though we wouldn't want a repeat

06:41.406 --> 06:43.403
of that shooting
that started the Great War!

06:48.396 --> 06:52.389
In fact, the Mayor suggested
we involve the Boy Scouts.

06:52.390 --> 06:54.386
Patrol Leader Demetrios
is looking for a successor.

06:54.387 --> 06:56.423
Perhaps you could be him, Leslie.

06:56.424 --> 06:58.380
I'd be delighted.

06:58.381 --> 07:02.374
Young minds, smart uniforms,
outdoor pursuits, discipline.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.372
All the good bits from the Hitler Youth.

07:06.369 --> 07:08.366
But... not the bad bits.

07:33.329 --> 07:35.325
Leslie Durrell.

07:35.326 --> 07:39.319
You tried to join my Fire Brigade.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.316
That was humiliating.

07:41.317 --> 07:44.311
But I thrive on disappointment!

07:44.312 --> 07:47.307
You're prepared
to take over as Patrol Leader?

07:47.308 --> 07:48.505
Yes, I am.

07:48.506 --> 07:51.301
"Be prepared"!
It's in the rules.

07:51.302 --> 07:54.297
They are becoming
too high-spirited for me.

07:54.298 --> 07:56.294
Well, I come from a headstrong family,

07:56.295 --> 07:58.291
so I'm used to unruly behaviour.

07:58.292 --> 08:00.288
Shall I watch you and learn?

08:00.289 --> 08:02.285
Good idea.

08:02.286 --> 08:03.803
Boys.

08:11.272 --> 08:13.269
Hello, lads.

08:25.930 --> 08:28.247
Don't worry. I was expecting that.

08:49.215 --> 08:53.209
This is like the novel
Murder On The Orient Express,

08:53.210 --> 08:54.566
by Agatha Christie.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.205
Do you know it?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.202
Someone is killed on a train

08:58.203 --> 09:00.198
on which there are different
foreign passengers.

09:00.199 --> 09:02.196
Who did it?

09:17.174 --> 09:20.168
The history of the world
is an history of aggression.

09:20.169 --> 09:21.168
Ah? We're all guilty.

09:21.169 --> 09:24.362
Maybe the British woman did it.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.159
Why do you say that?

09:26.160 --> 09:29.156
Because the British cannot be trusted.

09:32.191 --> 09:35.506
Good, that's broken the ice.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.142
Who'd like a sandwich?

09:38.143 --> 09:40.138
My Aunt Prue made these for me.

09:40.139 --> 09:42.135
What is in them?

09:42.136 --> 09:44.173
Looks like... pilchards and pickle.

10:01.308 --> 10:04.104
Ah... It's nice out here.
With the old...

10:05.142 --> 10:07.099
..sea.

10:11.093 --> 10:14.089
So... Any news from your wife?

10:16.086 --> 10:18.083
No.

10:26.750 --> 10:30.064
Hah! I was just thinking
about how possessive we get,

10:30.065 --> 10:33.059
then we look back and realise
how silly we were.

10:33.060 --> 10:38.052
Before marriage, what do you say,
fill your boots?!

10:38.053 --> 10:39.570
I know I did.
I know.

10:39.571 --> 10:43.045
Any girlfriend I've had on Corfu,
you went out with her mother!

10:46.041 --> 10:49.035
But after marriage,
you've made your vows,

10:49.036 --> 10:52.032
so be faithful, and honourable.

10:53.709 --> 10:55.028
Yeah, ideally...

10:56.026 --> 10:59.021
I loved my father,

10:59.022 --> 11:01.217
but he cheated on my mother,

11:01.218 --> 11:04.013
a lot.

11:04.014 --> 11:08.008
Each time, it tore another piece
off her heart...

11:09.007 --> 11:11.003
..until there was nothing left.

11:11.004 --> 11:15.996
And I promised her
I would never be like my father.

11:29.176 --> 11:30.974
Excuse me.

11:32.971 --> 11:37.165
Spiros just...
It's all right, I heard.

11:38.962 --> 11:40.959
Now will you tell his wife
that it's over?

11:41.957 --> 11:43.314
Of course.

11:43.315 --> 11:45.153
I'm sorry.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.944
And for God's sake, keep this
from my mother, as well as Spiros.

11:49.945 --> 11:53.939
Just have to wander back to Dorset,
won't I?

11:55.297 --> 11:59.132
Resume my life as a dusty solicitor.

12:00.929 --> 12:01.928
Maybe it's best.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.922
You could move into something
like conveyancing.

12:04.923 --> 12:06.920
That'll get my pulse racing (!)

12:08.757 --> 12:10.753
I'll just stay for the King's visit.

12:10.754 --> 12:11.912
And I'll say goodbye to Dimitra.

12:11.913 --> 12:14.907
I'll do that for you.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.905
No, I'll do it.

12:43.705 --> 12:44.863
SHE SHRIEKS PLAYFULLY

13:03.835 --> 13:06.031
Hah. Fit for a Greek king.

13:06.032 --> 13:09.826
Thank you.
But you can just call me Spiros.

13:12.183 --> 13:13.819
They say cooking is like making love.

13:13.820 --> 13:15.816
Don't be salacious.

13:15.817 --> 13:18.812
I will come over there
and wash your mouth out. OK.

13:18.813 --> 13:20.810
Me first, then I'll do yours.

13:26.641 --> 13:27.799
Ah! Stop it!

13:51.763 --> 13:53.959
Gerry, you've made a beautiful zoo.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.753
Thanks. With a touch of farmyard.

13:57.754 --> 14:02.746
I hear you're being driven mad
by the Royal Welcoming Committee.

14:02.747 --> 14:05.742
Yes, and I thought
the Corfu Lunar Society were tricky!

14:05.743 --> 14:08.777
But they tell me
the King loves wildlife.

14:08.778 --> 14:10.734
I'll ask him for a donation.

14:10.735 --> 14:12.731
No, no, don't do that,

14:12.732 --> 14:15.727
but could you lay on
a tableau of animals

14:15.728 --> 14:17.724
for him to enjoy as he sails past?

14:17.725 --> 14:19.721
As long as he doesn't expect them

14:19.722 --> 14:21.398
to stand there immobile,
quietly grinning.

14:21.399 --> 14:24.394
No, the rest of us will do that.
Thank you, Gerry.

14:24.395 --> 14:26.392
I'll tick that off my list.

14:30.386 --> 14:31.703
Mmm. That's good.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.700
Those are really good.

14:33.701 --> 14:36.696
Too good. We'll keep these.

14:38.693 --> 14:41.688
Mr and Mrs Bunn, the royal bakers!

14:41.689 --> 14:43.685
Greetings. What news from the King?

14:43.686 --> 14:45.682
He's here in two days, and at this rate,

14:45.683 --> 14:49.516
he'll take one look at Corfu, and
head for a more organised island.

14:49.517 --> 14:51.673
Well, this is ready, at least.

14:51.674 --> 14:54.668
What is it supposed to be?

14:54.669 --> 14:56.665
The King's face.

14:56.666 --> 15:00.659
It's harder than it looks to put
a face on a pie, you'll find, Theo.

15:00.660 --> 15:04.654
Ah, right, Theo, for the king's visit...

15:04.655 --> 15:07.649
Six scouts will do a drumroll
on massive drums,

15:07.650 --> 15:09.646
then the other boys
will swing down on ropes

15:09.647 --> 15:11.643
from the big trees in the garden,

15:11.644 --> 15:13.640
there, there, and there.

15:13.641 --> 15:16.636
Each of them will activate
blue and white fireworks,

15:16.637 --> 15:17.635
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

15:19.632 --> 15:21.628
Are you out of your mind?

15:21.629 --> 15:24.624
Yes, at this late stage,
something simpler and less fatal?

15:24.625 --> 15:28.618
And darling, please involve
Gerry in your Scout troop.

15:28.619 --> 15:29.617
Why?

15:29.618 --> 15:32.612
Well, because I'd love
the two of you to get on better.

15:32.613 --> 15:35.607
And to broaden Gerry's horizons
from animals.

15:35.608 --> 15:38.603
Get an interest in knots.
Or bugling.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.600
But he'll just hate it and make fun.

15:40.601 --> 15:42.597
No, not if he's involved.

15:42.598 --> 15:45.593
Oh, he is your brother.

15:47.111 --> 15:48.588
To prevail on you again,

15:48.589 --> 15:50.625
there are more officials
from the royal advance party

15:50.626 --> 15:53.580
than we realised.
Do you have any spare accommodation?

15:53.581 --> 15:54.779
Um, yes.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.576
We have two guests in one room,

15:56.577 --> 15:59.571
and Gerry, Basil, and Leslie in theirs.

15:59.572 --> 16:01.568
Otherwise...
And... Spiros has his own room?

16:01.569 --> 16:02.568
Oh, God, yes.

16:02.569 --> 16:04.564
Yes, Spiros has his own room!
Of course.

16:04.565 --> 16:06.761
If I may, I'll send you a guest or two,

16:06.762 --> 16:08.558
non-paying, I'm afraid.
Fine.

16:08.559 --> 16:11.554
And Spiros really does
have his own room.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.552
I know. You said!

16:19.543 --> 16:21.579
Of course people think you're
having an affair with Spiros.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.536
I thought you didn't care.

16:23.537 --> 16:24.535
Well, I wouldn't, if it were true!

16:24.536 --> 16:27.530
I'm being hung for a crime I haven't
had the pleasure of committing.

16:27.531 --> 16:30.525
He's living with you, they're bound
to think he's more than a handyman.

16:30.526 --> 16:34.519
Spiros has his own bedroom,
on a different floor to mine.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.515
Yes, and there's no way he could
get into your bedroom from there (!)

16:37.516 --> 16:39.512
He'd have to walk yards...

16:39.513 --> 16:41.509
These are gorgeous.

16:41.510 --> 16:43.507
You and Spiros should open a patisserie.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.500
I want him so badly.

16:47.501 --> 16:49.497
Blimey.

16:49.498 --> 16:52.492
But I'm petrified.
Why?

16:52.493 --> 16:54.489
Well, look at my record.

16:54.490 --> 16:56.686
My husband died at 43,

16:56.687 --> 16:58.483
Sven told me he was homosexual

16:58.484 --> 17:00.480
the day before
we were due to be married.

17:00.481 --> 17:02.517
Yes, shame on you!
Hugh was stabbed.

17:02.518 --> 17:04.473
Daphne and Leslie
were halfway up the aisle,

17:04.474 --> 17:06.152
look what happened to them.

17:06.153 --> 17:07.470
We're happily married.

17:07.471 --> 17:10.465
Despite the thing he does
with the, erm...

17:10.467 --> 17:11.464
Anyway!

17:11.464 --> 17:12.464
It does happen, you know.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.457
Well, it's all academic, anyway.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.454
Spiros may not love Dimitra,

17:18.454 --> 17:20.451
but he's wedded to her, in every sense.

17:20.452 --> 17:23.446
Oh, I have an update
on her rumoured indiscretion.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.439
I don't need a dramatic pause.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.436
Well, apparently it's with a foreigner,

17:30.437 --> 17:32.434
because she feels that doesn't count.

17:34.431 --> 17:37.426
Thank God Larry's away,
or I'd suspect him.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.455
So I'll be using English,

17:44.456 --> 17:46.612
the most important language
in the world.

17:46.613 --> 17:48.409
And it'll get you an English badge.

17:48.410 --> 17:51.405
Anyone who doesn't understand,
put your hand up.

17:53.402 --> 17:56.397
How would I get my Anti-Hunting badge?

17:56.398 --> 17:59.392
That doesn't exist,
but do try for the Idiot Badge.

17:59.393 --> 18:00.392
Yes, Sotiris?

18:00.393 --> 18:02.588
Can we go to the zoo of Gerry?

18:02.589 --> 18:04.065
Yes, but only because

18:04.066 --> 18:07.380
that's where we're going to practise
our display for the King.

18:07.381 --> 18:09.377
Yes, Stavros?

18:09.378 --> 18:12.373
My parents say the British are bad.

18:12.374 --> 18:15.369
Really.
And who do they like better?

18:15.370 --> 18:17.366
Nazis.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.363
I've got my eye on you.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.360
Right, we will now march to my house.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.355
I will lead, my brother Gerald
will bring up the rear.

18:24.356 --> 18:26.034
Panos, drum.

18:44.326 --> 18:46.003
We are all going to home.

18:46.004 --> 18:48.998
Margo, why are you
in the other direction?

18:48.999 --> 18:52.313
Where would you rather be,
England or Greece?

18:52.314 --> 18:54.311
My family are in Corfu.

18:55.310 --> 18:57.306
War or no war, I wanna be with them.

18:57.307 --> 19:01.300
What madness, we all must run home.

19:01.301 --> 19:03.297
Like er,
rabbits disappearing into holes.

19:03.298 --> 19:05.294
It was you who invaded Albania.

19:05.295 --> 19:07.291
No. No, I have an alibi.

19:07.292 --> 19:08.290
I was sitting in a cafe in Paris.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.486
We should be like Switzerland.

19:10.487 --> 19:12.283
They say no to war.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.279
So they can say yes
to making more money.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.276
So you think only Greece is perfect,

19:17.277 --> 19:20.311
with its prime minister
who burns books he doesn't like,

19:20.312 --> 19:24.267
and would embrace fascism
if his King wasn't so pro-Britain?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.302
I can read a newspaper.

19:29.259 --> 19:32.255
Why not persuade your family
to join you in England, huh?

19:33.453 --> 19:36.249
Because Corfu feels like home.

19:41.241 --> 19:43.237
A MAN HUMS

19:43.238 --> 19:45.234
Oh. Herete.

19:45.235 --> 19:47.231
You must be part of the royal entourage?

19:47.232 --> 19:49.228
Yes. Theodore Stephanides sent us.

19:49.229 --> 19:53.222
Ah, right, well, er,
let me take you to your rooms.

19:53.223 --> 19:56.218
Or would you like to show the
Royal party upstairs, Lugaretzia?

19:56.219 --> 19:58.215
No.

19:58.216 --> 20:00.212
Lugaretzia is a republican.

20:00.213 --> 20:02.209
Do not tell them!

20:02.210 --> 20:04.206
Yes, she is full of surprises.

20:04.207 --> 20:08.200
But her real allegiance
is to hypochondria.

20:08.201 --> 20:11.196
Don't ask her how she's feeling.
She will tell you.

20:26.174 --> 20:28.370
Ah, at ease.

20:28.371 --> 20:30.207
Good walking.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.165
Kosmas, are we recovered?

20:33.164 --> 20:35.160
Good boy.
A bleeding knee is a happy knee.

20:35.161 --> 20:38.155
Oh, and well done
for ignoring the crazy shouting man.

20:38.156 --> 20:40.152
We are not a military organisation,

20:40.153 --> 20:41.152
or silly...

20:41.153 --> 20:45.145
We are here to make friends,
serve our elders, and learn skills.

20:45.146 --> 20:47.142
And today's skill is... knotting.

20:47.143 --> 20:49.139
Here are your practice ropes.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.976
Now, knots are vital.

20:50.977 --> 20:53.133
Without them, our lives
would literally fall apart.

20:53.134 --> 20:54.132
HE CHUCKLES

20:54.133 --> 20:56.128
Now, these are your practice ropes...

20:56.129 --> 20:58.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you going?

20:58.126 --> 20:59.125
To see the animals.

20:59.126 --> 21:01.121
Gerry, can you get them back, please?

21:01.122 --> 21:03.118
Gerry!

21:03.119 --> 21:05.115
Oh, hello, Leslie!

21:05.116 --> 21:07.112
I'm so proud of you, poppet.

21:07.113 --> 21:08.949
Mother, can you not?

21:08.950 --> 21:10.107
I'm a figure of authority...

21:10.108 --> 21:12.144
Oh, yes, of course, sorry.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.101
How's it going?

21:14.102 --> 21:17.138
Yes, very well.
We're just taking a short break...

21:19.774 --> 21:21.091
MAN SINGING

21:21.092 --> 21:23.088
# Let me call you sweetheart

21:23.089 --> 21:25.086
# Because we are through

21:27.083 --> 21:29.758
# Let me hear you whisper

21:29.759 --> 21:32.076
# That you love me too... #

21:33.074 --> 21:35.070
Yamas!

21:35.071 --> 21:38.106
# Let the love light glowing

21:38.107 --> 21:41.061
# In your eyes, so true

21:41.062 --> 21:43.418
# Let me call you sweetheart

21:43.419 --> 21:45.056
# Because agapi mou... #

21:46.055 --> 21:47.053
No...

22:08.022 --> 22:12.015
WHISPERING: I think Dimitra's
foreign lover is Basil.

22:12.016 --> 22:14.012
SHE GASPS No!

22:14.013 --> 22:17.846
On our trip to Kalami,
she really seemed to like him.

22:17.847 --> 22:20.522
And now he's being all lovey-dovey

22:20.523 --> 22:22.839
and singing with a Greek accent.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.037
Hah... Good enough for me.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.194
But he's so...

22:26.195 --> 22:30.507
Well, some women do go for that
shiny-Englishman-in-a-cravat type.

22:30.508 --> 22:32.185
Are you talking about me?
No!

22:32.186 --> 22:36.978
Er, only in the broadest,
woolliest sense.

22:36.979 --> 22:38.815
Your amazing cakes!

22:38.816 --> 22:40.972
That was it.
Thank you.

22:40.973 --> 22:44.966
In fact, I'm a terrible cook,
but I have a secret ingredient.

22:44.967 --> 22:46.963
Oh, what's that?

22:46.964 --> 22:48.162
Mrs Durrells.

22:53.794 --> 22:56.948
So, what are you going to do?

22:56.949 --> 22:58.785
Oh, I don't know.

22:58.786 --> 22:59.943
Not tell Leslie.

22:59.944 --> 23:03.458
He'd strangle Basil
with his own voluminous shorts.

23:03.459 --> 23:06.933
Still, it's exciting that this may
finally get you two together.

23:06.934 --> 23:08.930
No, the opposite will happen.

23:08.931 --> 23:11.925
Spiros said
he'll kill Dimitra's boyfriend,

23:11.926 --> 23:13.922
and here we are, harbouring him.

23:13.923 --> 23:15.919
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR

23:15.920 --> 23:17.916
Kalimera.
Oh!

23:17.917 --> 23:20.752
It's more courtiers...

23:20.753 --> 23:23.749
Florence, you have spare rooms...
No, we haven't.

23:36.889 --> 23:39.884
This would make a good crime novel.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.881
What?

23:41.882 --> 23:44.876
A person less each time.

23:44.877 --> 23:47.872
Killed one by one in inventive ways,

23:47.873 --> 23:50.868
but by which member of the group?

23:51.867 --> 23:53.864
Ovvio, no?

23:55.861 --> 23:56.898
Too obvious.

23:56.899 --> 24:00.852
He seems dangerous,
so he must be an absolute sweetie.

24:00.853 --> 24:06.843
Well, you seem sweet,
so you must be dangerous.

24:06.844 --> 24:10.199
Damn, he's noticed!

24:13.834 --> 24:15.831
Right, I hope
you've all brought your flags.

24:18.826 --> 24:20.822
And the rest of you?

24:20.823 --> 24:21.822
Sorry, we forgot.

24:21.823 --> 24:24.816
Well, we can't practise properly,
then, can we?

24:24.817 --> 24:26.494
We can go and see the animals again.

24:26.495 --> 24:27.812
No! No!

24:27.813 --> 24:30.328
No! No! No!

24:30.329 --> 24:31.807
Stop!

24:32.806 --> 24:35.001
Gerald Durrell.

24:35.002 --> 24:38.316
Your behaviour falls below
the standard required

24:38.317 --> 24:40.793
to remain a member of the Corfu Patrol.

24:40.794 --> 24:41.792
I'm going to court-martial you.

24:41.793 --> 24:43.788
And what does that involve?

24:43.789 --> 24:45.785
The confiscation of your woggle.

24:45.786 --> 24:46.785
What is a woggle?

24:48.782 --> 24:51.777
This is a woggle!

24:52.776 --> 24:54.772
THE BOYS MUTTER IN GREEK

24:54.773 --> 24:57.768
I have animals to prepare
for the royal visit, so...

25:06.595 --> 25:07.753
KNOCK AT DOOR

25:11.747 --> 25:14.743
Might I have a word?

25:16.740 --> 25:19.734
Please excuse any items
of an intimate nature.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.731
I've been cleaning your room all year.

25:21.732 --> 25:25.726
I am horribly familiar
with your... intimabilia.

25:35.232 --> 25:37.388
I'll speak plainly.

25:37.389 --> 25:40.384
I know you've started seeing a woman,

25:40.385 --> 25:42.700
because you've been galloping
through your aftershave

25:42.701 --> 25:44.697
like an over-zealous gigolo.

25:44.698 --> 25:47.373
You'd make an excellent
vice-squad detective.

25:47.374 --> 25:48.691
Thank you.

25:48.692 --> 25:52.685
Do you want to tell me who she is,
assuming it's a she?

25:52.686 --> 25:53.685
Yes, it's a she!

25:53.686 --> 25:56.200
Sorry.

25:56.201 --> 25:58.676
I can't tell you who it is,

25:58.677 --> 26:02.670
because...
she is a very private person.

26:02.671 --> 26:05.667
It's Spiros's wife, isn't it?

26:07.344 --> 26:08.661
Yes, it is.

26:08.662 --> 26:13.175
Basil, of all the women on Corfu!
Why Dimitra?

26:13.176 --> 26:14.652
Two reasons.

26:14.653 --> 26:17.648
She's beautiful, and she's nice to me.

26:17.649 --> 26:18.647
That isn't a reason!

26:18.648 --> 26:20.164
Those aren't the two reasons.

26:20.165 --> 26:21.842
They're bracketed together
under Reason One.

26:21.843 --> 26:23.639
So you could say
there are three reasons.

26:23.640 --> 26:26.634
Reason Two, under the original
numbering system...

26:26.635 --> 26:28.631
I didn't think it would do your chances

26:28.632 --> 26:30.309
of getting together with Spiros
any harm.

26:30.310 --> 26:33.625
I don't believe
Reason Two for one moment.

26:35.622 --> 26:39.615
Dimitra only contemplated
having relations with me

26:39.616 --> 26:42.611
because you are having them with Spiros.

26:42.612 --> 26:45.606
I am not! How dare she say that?!

26:45.607 --> 26:48.283
Well, you'll be pleased to hear that...

26:49.601 --> 26:52.597
..I will be leaving Corfu
imminently.

26:54.594 --> 26:56.590
I'm sorry.

26:56.591 --> 26:59.106
But thank you.

26:59.107 --> 27:01.583
It's for the best.

27:14.564 --> 27:15.762
GENERAL CHATTER

27:19.556 --> 27:21.553
FRANTIC CONVERSATION

27:27.544 --> 27:29.541
ALL TALK OVER ONE ANOTHER

27:45.518 --> 27:47.714
SCREAMING, COMMOTION

28:06.486 --> 28:09.482
Have you noticed, nobody's tried
to sit in this carriage?

28:11.479 --> 28:12.477
Yes.

28:12.478 --> 28:14.514
Isn't that surprising?
No.

28:18.468 --> 28:22.462
You did not notice my home-made sign?

28:24.459 --> 28:27.454
No. Otherwise I'd have removed it.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.451
I like meeting people.

28:29.452 --> 28:32.446
Soon it might not be easy
to cross Europe like this.

28:32.447 --> 28:35.962
Nobody in Europe
is as interesting as me.

28:38.439 --> 28:40.955
Think of the chances
of that being true...

28:42.433 --> 28:45.427
My last boyfriend, Zoltan,
was arrogant, like you,

28:45.428 --> 28:47.424
til I tamed him.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.421
What happened?

28:49.422 --> 28:50.421
He went home to Turkey.

28:50.422 --> 28:53.416
Turks are...
Don't be rude!

28:58.409 --> 29:01.403
As soon as I saw you,
I wanted the others to leave us.

29:01.404 --> 29:04.399
So why have you been so unpleasant
since Paris?

29:04.400 --> 29:07.394
I thought I was being interesting.

29:07.395 --> 29:09.391
I wanted to get your attention.

29:09.392 --> 29:10.431
Really?

29:11.589 --> 29:13.386
Well, next time, try this.

29:17.420 --> 29:20.376
You're moving gradually closer.

29:21.574 --> 29:23.370
Yes.

29:23.371 --> 29:26.367
It helps we've been breathing
the same air for two days.

29:28.364 --> 29:30.360
I almost can't imagine
not being with you.

29:30.361 --> 29:32.358
Good.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.194
Don't try.

29:36.352 --> 29:37.710
Go on, then.

29:46.337 --> 29:50.690
I can't sleep cos I'm thinking
of all the ways I could kill Gerry.

29:50.691 --> 29:54.324
Why, is there a scout badge for killing?

29:54.325 --> 29:57.320
Well, if there isn't already,
I'll start one!

29:57.321 --> 29:58.358
Shh.

29:58.359 --> 30:00.315
Idiot!

30:00.316 --> 30:02.313
It's really not... Shh.

30:06.307 --> 30:09.302
How many people are in the house?
17.

30:09.303 --> 30:14.295
I almost envy Margo, tucked up
in her own bedroom in England.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.330
Prue and Geoffrey across the hallway,

30:17.331 --> 30:20.285
snoring away
in their heavy-duty pyjamas.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.325
Mmm...

30:25.279 --> 30:27.275
Larry hasn't written for ages.

30:27.276 --> 30:30.111
I hate not knowing where all of you are.

30:30.112 --> 30:35.263
You're my planets. I want you
in a fixed constellation around me.

30:35.264 --> 30:36.262
I'm here.

30:36.263 --> 30:38.459
Here.

30:43.252 --> 30:44.251
Thank you.

30:47.246 --> 30:50.241
So, tomorrow the King will sail past
on his ship,

30:50.242 --> 30:52.238
and we... do things.

30:52.239 --> 30:56.232
We'd make the effort if our
own monarch sailed past our house.

30:56.233 --> 30:58.229
What are your Scouts doing?

30:58.230 --> 31:00.226
Oh, you'll see tomorrow.

31:00.227 --> 31:02.223
Precision choreography.

31:02.224 --> 31:04.220
No thanks to Gerry.

31:04.221 --> 31:05.258
Well, I've got a zoo to run,

31:05.259 --> 31:08.214
can't spend time
playing at toy soldiers.

31:08.215 --> 31:10.730
Well, say that politely and don't go,

31:10.731 --> 31:12.248
rather than sabotaging Leslie's dream

31:12.249 --> 31:14.205
of being taken seriously.

31:14.206 --> 31:18.200
Yeah. And what are animals,
if not toy people?

31:20.197 --> 31:23.191
Basil says he's leaving soon.

31:23.192 --> 31:27.864
Oh, yes, he mentioned that.

31:27.865 --> 31:30.181
He loves it here.
Why would he leave?

31:30.182 --> 31:33.176
Probably just wants to go home.

31:33.177 --> 31:34.176
Exactly.

31:50.152 --> 31:54.145
"I fear I am trying your patience
with these outpourings.

31:54.146 --> 31:58.139
"But what are offspring for,
if not to sit and listen?

31:58.140 --> 32:00.136
"Love, Mother.

32:00.137 --> 32:06.807
"PS. Also, your father
would be so proud of you...

32:07.965 --> 32:10.122
"..if he hadn't so stupidly died."

32:12.119 --> 32:16.951
"Mamma, fear not,
your 12 pages rushed past,

32:16.952 --> 32:18.109
"though page eight sagged somewhat

32:18.110 --> 32:21.105
"under the weight
of its extended bread metaphor.

32:21.106 --> 32:26.097
"I'm blooming, despite Hitler
doing his best to ruin the mood.

and I love you."

33:08.036 --> 33:10.032
I'm sorry to call so early,

33:10.033 --> 33:13.027
but the King's sailing past
in a couple of hours

33:13.028 --> 33:15.025
and I have bunting to iron.

33:19.019 --> 33:22.014
I've only come because
there seems to be some confusion.

33:22.015 --> 33:26.008
I have never
so much as kissed your husband.

33:26.009 --> 33:29.003
So why is he living with you?

33:29.004 --> 33:31.520
Because he's helping out
around the house and the garden.

33:31.521 --> 33:33.997
He's building homes for our 93 animals.

33:35.994 --> 33:39.508
You made it clear
you didn't want Spiros in your life.

33:39.509 --> 33:42.823
Why else would you
take your children away to Athens?

33:42.824 --> 33:45.979
Because for years he has been
under your spell, and I had enough.

33:49.973 --> 33:53.488
So ask him back.
I'm sure he'll come.

33:55.645 --> 33:57.960
But you don't want him back now, do you?

33:57.961 --> 33:59.958
Because you have Basil.

34:01.316 --> 34:03.951
Basil is kind, and generous.

34:03.952 --> 34:05.948
Spiros gives me nothing.

34:05.949 --> 34:07.945
Because he has no money!

34:07.946 --> 34:09.942
And you'd only make fun of him.
I've seen you.

34:09.943 --> 34:12.938
You see the boyfriend Spiros.
I see the husband,

34:12.938 --> 34:15.933
with the shouting,
and he thinks he owns me.

34:15.934 --> 34:18.929
Yes, well, they can be
a bit like that, can't they?

34:18.929 --> 34:19.928
Men.

34:22.924 --> 34:24.920
Yes.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.916
I used to worship my late husband...

34:29.913 --> 34:33.906
..but even he could be a bit of a...
Well, a zoo-keeper with me.

34:33.907 --> 34:36.902
He was loving and protective, but...

34:38.900 --> 34:39.898
Anyway.

34:39.899 --> 34:42.893
Basil isn't like that.

34:42.893 --> 34:43.931
He listens.

34:43.931 --> 34:47.406
It wasn't even his idea to come to me.

34:47.407 --> 34:48.884
But he said it was.

34:48.885 --> 34:51.880
No, it was your son, Leslie's.

34:53.398 --> 34:54.875
What?!

34:54.876 --> 34:56.871
To make it easier
for you to be with Spiros,

34:56.873 --> 34:59.869
with me the evil adulteress.

35:01.866 --> 35:03.862
Well, Basil is leaving,

35:03.863 --> 35:05.859
so you and Spiros need to decide

35:05.860 --> 35:07.857
whether or not
you have a future together.

35:09.854 --> 35:12.848
And if he says no, you are there,
waiting for him.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.205
Spiros is an honourable man.

35:15.206 --> 35:17.841
If he was going to walk away
from your marriage,

35:17.842 --> 35:20.198
he would've done so a long time ago.

35:37.492 --> 35:39.009
Excellent work.

35:39.010 --> 35:42.843
And keep the flags straight.

35:42.844 --> 35:45.799
Well done, Panos.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.476
And flutter.

35:49.474 --> 35:50.791
Down.

35:50.792 --> 35:53.788
And moving in...

35:55.785 --> 35:57.781
And the flags going out!

35:57.782 --> 36:00.777
And into the wave formation...

36:00.778 --> 36:05.770
Kalos. Poli kala!

36:07.767 --> 36:10.442
You're only letting yourself down,
Stavros.

36:10.443 --> 36:13.278
I think we can improve
on that final shape, but well done.

36:13.279 --> 36:16.754
Final run-through shortly,
in front of the officials.

I was just saying a final goodbye
to your special lady.

36:43.713 --> 36:45.709
Are you leaving?

36:45.710 --> 36:46.709
Yes.

36:46.710 --> 36:50.702
And everyone I've known on Corfu
is getting a quick visit.

36:50.703 --> 36:52.699
If they want one or not!

36:52.700 --> 36:53.897
How cruel!

36:53.898 --> 36:57.693
Anyway, I'll leave you to your...

36:58.731 --> 37:00.527
..marriage.

37:00.528 --> 37:01.686
It's OK.

37:01.687 --> 37:04.681
I've just come for my smart suit,
for when I meet the King.

37:04.682 --> 37:06.679
Jolly good.

37:08.676 --> 37:10.673
Basil?

37:13.669 --> 37:16.664
Thank you for taking the trouble
to call on my wife.

37:17.663 --> 37:19.340
What a nice thought.

37:28.487 --> 37:30.642
To put around this, for the King to see.

37:30.643 --> 37:33.638
Believe me, you don't wanna wrap
a flag around a barn owl.

37:33.639 --> 37:35.635
You'll have his beak through your hand.

37:35.636 --> 37:36.634
Oh.

37:36.635 --> 37:38.630
And what's this for?
The snakes.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.628
No, you can't paint the snakes blue.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.603
Come on, boys, in we get.

37:58.602 --> 38:01.596
So, the King's ship will be coming
from that direction,

38:01.597 --> 38:04.592
and when it gets there, this happens!

38:55.037 --> 38:57.512
Ooh, a swastika.

38:57.513 --> 38:59.511
That's a little off-colour.

39:01.508 --> 39:03.504
Stop that swastika right now!

39:03.505 --> 39:05.501
Anybody contributing to the Nazi symbol

39:05.502 --> 39:07.498
will have to return their Scout badges.

39:07.499 --> 39:10.493
And yes, Stavros, that means you!

39:10.494 --> 39:11.493
Get them down!

Stop! Stop! Stop that!

39:14.488 --> 39:17.483
Stop that right now!

39:17.484 --> 39:18.482
Please...

39:18.483 --> 39:21.517
I don't think Leslie's Scouts
should perform for the King.

39:21.518 --> 39:23.474
They might give the wrong idea.

39:23.475 --> 39:25.471
In fact, the King isn't sailing
this way.

39:25.472 --> 39:27.468
There's been a change of plan.

39:27.469 --> 39:30.463
I'm really disappointed in you.

39:30.464 --> 39:32.301
It's like actual Germany, isn't it?

39:32.302 --> 39:34.817
One bad... fly

39:34.818 --> 39:37.454
ruins an otherwise excellent
and decent soup.

39:53.430 --> 39:55.426
Oh, well!

39:55.427 --> 39:57.424
Anyone need any Greek flags?

40:13.760 --> 40:17.394
You did say NOT the bad bits
from the Hitler Youth, remember?

40:21.388 --> 40:24.384
I went to see Dimitra
early this morning.

40:26.221 --> 40:28.377
And she told me it was your master plan

40:28.378 --> 40:31.373
to get Basil together with her.

40:32.372 --> 40:35.367
Oh, thank God you know,
it's been killing me.

40:36.366 --> 40:39.360
I'm sorry, I thought it
would help you end up with Spiros.

40:39.361 --> 40:45.192
Then I realised it was a mistake,
but Basil wouldn't give Dimitra up.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.709
There's been enough deception.

40:46.710 --> 40:50.345
Let's admit the whole truth to Spiros.

40:51.343 --> 40:54.339
But he said he'd kill whoever was
having an affair with his wife.

40:56.016 --> 40:59.331
It's Basil, I think it's worth risking.

41:00.330 --> 41:02.326
And he's leaving tonight.

41:02.327 --> 41:03.845
Where is everybody?!

41:04.843 --> 41:08.317
Three trays of cake,
I feel like Goldilocks.

41:08.318 --> 41:10.314
It can't be!

41:10.315 --> 41:11.314
Oh, Margo!

41:13.311 --> 41:16.305
You didn't tell us you were coming back.

41:16.306 --> 41:17.663
I missed you so much.

41:17.664 --> 41:20.299
I missed you too.
Margo's back, everyone!

41:20.300 --> 41:21.657
God, you're loud.

41:21.658 --> 41:24.293
Ah, sorry,
I've been screaming at Boy Scouts.

41:24.294 --> 41:25.492
I know that voice.

41:26.810 --> 41:28.287
How was your trip?

41:28.288 --> 41:32.281
Um, very... fruitful.

Oh... Hello.

41:37.275 --> 41:39.271
Hello.

41:39.272 --> 41:42.266
Boyfriend?
Yes.

41:42.267 --> 41:45.262
And he's going to live with us.

41:45.263 --> 41:47.259
Oh, well, we're rather crowded,
I'm afraid,

41:47.260 --> 41:48.457
you may have to share a bed.

41:48.458 --> 41:51.253
I don't mind.
That is not a problem.

41:51.254 --> 41:53.251
No, not the two of you together!

41:54.289 --> 41:56.445
This is a genteel house now.

41:56.446 --> 41:58.603
Well, Spiros is staying here!

41:59.601 --> 42:01.238
That's very different, isn't it?

42:01.239 --> 42:03.275
Because Spiros is doing jobs
around the house.

42:03.276 --> 42:07.229
Now, we are just getting ready
to take this food into town

42:07.230 --> 42:11.223
to join in whatever is left
of the celebrations.

42:11.224 --> 42:12.901
Oh, what are we celebrating?

42:12.902 --> 42:15.217
The pointless King is visiting.

42:15.218 --> 42:16.256
Ah, that's nice.

42:16.257 --> 42:19.212
Can I have some of this dog-face pie?

42:20.211 --> 42:22.208
That's the King.

42:38.184 --> 42:40.180
but I've given up worrying.

42:40.181 --> 42:41.219
We enjoy confusion.

Where's Basil?

many miles to see the King.

43:44.085 --> 43:45.084
What does he look like?

43:45.085 --> 43:47.081
We couldn't find him.

Spiros...

43:54.070 --> 43:55.428
This isn't easy...

43:57.066 --> 43:59.063

Well, it was with Basil.

44:16.038 --> 44:18.035
And... And I put Basil up to it.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.028
I thought it would bring
you and Mother together.

44:22.029 --> 44:25.023
But Basil's left Corfu now, so...

You were in my house today!

44:47.990 --> 44:50.186

It would be rude not to.

44:50.187 --> 44:52.982

Sorry?

Spiros, we're all to blame.

45:12.953 --> 45:15.987
You interfered in my life
and my marriage.

45:15.988 --> 45:17.945
I was the last to know.

45:19.942 --> 45:21.939
I can never forgive you.

45:26.932 --> 45:27.930
Spiros...

45:28.969 --> 45:31.764
I think we can agree
that I deserved that.

45:33.921 --> 45:35.918
Definitely be off, then.

45:44.905 --> 45:46.901
Italy's invaded Albania.

45:46.902 --> 45:48.898
We're all back together,
and we're not going anywhere.

45:48.899 --> 45:50.935
You must take your family
back to England.

45:50.936 --> 45:53.890
I'm trying to see it
as setting them all free,

45:53.891 --> 45:55.887
but it feels more like
losing a lot of friends.

45:55.888 --> 45:57.884

ever since you met her.

45:57.885 --> 45:59.921
And you feel guilty because
that's what broke your marriage.

45:59.922 --> 46:01.878
It's not about me.

46:01.879 --> 46:04.875
It is. I want it to be!
