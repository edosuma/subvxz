00:12.344 --> 00:13.620
<i>The Tsirku river,</i>

00:14.137 --> 00:15.482
<i>Southeast, Alaska.</i>

00:17.103 --> 00:20.275
<i>Dustin Hurt and his crew
are on the nine-mile commute</i>

00:20.275 --> 00:21.344
<i>into Nugget Creek.</i>

00:25.413 --> 00:27.379
If I slow down,
that water will sink us.

00:30.103 --> 00:32.344
Holy [bleep]!

00:41.068 --> 00:43.965
That was a long
ride, y'all.

00:45.827 --> 00:47.344
If I had a bucket list,
I could say,

00:47.344 --> 00:49.206
this would be one
of the things that I would

00:49.206 --> 00:50.689
get to check off
my bucket list.

00:50.689 --> 00:52.620
Riding up a raging creek
in an airboat.

00:57.896 --> 01:00.448
<i>Restocked with fuel and supplies,</i>

01:00.448 --> 01:03.310
<i>Dustin is hell bent
on reaching bed rock</i>

01:03.310 --> 01:05.517
<i>and a life-changing
pile of gold.</i>

01:07.655 --> 01:10.103
This week,
we do nothing but dive.

01:10.793 --> 01:12.620
We dive, dive.

01:12.620 --> 01:16.172
We're gonna move boulders
and dredge everyday.

01:17.965 --> 01:21.206
We'll have gold in hand
by the end of the week

01:21.206 --> 01:22.000
for sure.

01:29.655 --> 01:31.103
Woah, woah!
Watch out!

01:31.103 --> 01:32.655
[bleep] That was
right against my head.

01:34.793 --> 01:36.482
Holy [bleep]!
The battle's on, man.

01:36.482 --> 01:38.413
It's always been on.

01:38.413 --> 01:40.068
Yeah,
I'm getting my ass kicked.

01:40.068 --> 01:41.137
It's a war, man.

01:43.965 --> 01:45.827
Yeah, I think
you're leaking gasoline.

01:45.827 --> 01:48.655
That's burning! Help!

01:48.655 --> 01:50.517
- Help me with that.
- I got you.

01:50.517 --> 01:53.172
I was like,
in the quarry, you know?

01:53.172 --> 01:55.482
Rocks to my left,
rocks to my right.

01:56.206 --> 01:57.344
Rocks to my front.

02:00.551 --> 02:01.724
We're gonna get gold today.

02:01.724 --> 02:03.689
It's gonna be all worthwhile.
We're gonna get gold.

02:05.551 --> 02:06.310
Look at that, buddy!

02:08.137 --> 02:10.517
We're gonna get more
gold than we ever thought.

02:10.517 --> 02:11.724
This is gonna be amazing.

02:22.896 --> 02:25.000
<i>Two months into
the five-month season</i>

02:25.000 --> 02:25.862
<i>at Nugget Creek...</i>

02:28.137 --> 02:29.793
We got
a good claim, dude.

02:29.793 --> 02:31.275
It's time to get
some real gold.

02:31.275 --> 02:33.344
<i>...at his
most remote claim,</i>

02:33.344 --> 02:35.206
<i>Dustin's been
pushed to the limit</i>

02:35.206 --> 02:37.517
<i>to get both
dive sites operational.</i>

02:38.586 --> 02:40.068
<i>I don't care
if something breaks.</i>

02:40.068 --> 02:42.137
<i>We're gonna fix it
that instant and keep going.</i>

02:43.206 --> 02:46.000
<i>Finally,
Dustin's time has come.</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:49.137
<i>This is his first chance
to dive for gold.</i>

02:50.793 --> 02:51.586
Real nice.

02:52.275 --> 02:53.827
I'm going diving, y'all!

02:55.034 --> 02:56.965
Time to get in the water.

02:56.965 --> 02:58.931
We need
to find nuggets.

02:58.931 --> 03:01.068
We need to find nuggets. Soon.

03:02.275 --> 03:03.034
No more prep.

03:03.896 --> 03:04.689
Just dig.

03:05.103 --> 03:05.896
Find gold.

03:08.482 --> 03:09.862
The water's
raising today.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.896
It's not clear.

03:11.896 --> 03:14.517
But Dustin's used to diving
in water that's not clear.

03:14.517 --> 03:16.344
But we know there's a lot
of gold in this creek.

03:16.344 --> 03:17.413
We need a sign.

03:17.413 --> 03:19.137
We've put in so much work now.

03:19.137 --> 03:20.137
I think by the end
of the week,

03:20.137 --> 03:21.620
we should have some gold
coming out of here.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.172
- You ready to have a good day?
- Yeah.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.655
Be my first
dive of the year.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.000
Little late, but...

03:29.000 --> 03:30.413
I guess better late
than never.

03:31.344 --> 03:32.103
All right.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.862
Oh, no!

03:43.551 --> 03:45.862
This is gonna be
a typical bull [bleep] day.

03:45.862 --> 03:47.000
dang it!

03:48.586 --> 03:49.379
What happened?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.482
It keeps dying.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.551
Oh, we forgot to turn
the [bleep] fuel off.

03:54.758 --> 03:56.896
The whole crank case
is probably full of gasoline.

03:58.068 --> 04:00.586
<i>All night,
gas has been flooding</i>

04:00.586 --> 04:03.482
<i>into the motor that supplies
air to the diver.</i>

04:05.172 --> 04:05.965
Damn it!

04:08.241 --> 04:10.965
It's not how
I wanted this to go.

04:10.965 --> 04:13.172
It's gonna cost us
a couple of [bleep] hours.

04:13.172 --> 04:15.310
<i>Dustin's first
dive of the season</i>

04:15.310 --> 04:18.931
<i>is on hold until Wes can
repair the flooded engine.</i>

04:20.344 --> 04:21.896
We are so far behind.

04:21.896 --> 04:24.931
If we stop working
for a day right now,

04:24.931 --> 04:28.034
we are in deep trouble.

04:37.172 --> 04:38.655
<i>Down at the trailhead,</i>

04:38.655 --> 04:40.482
<i>Kayla and her crew
are moving in</i>

04:40.482 --> 04:42.517
<i>the heavy lifting gear.</i>

04:42.517 --> 04:43.724
That's good
right there, dude.

04:45.689 --> 04:46.551
<i>Last week,</i>

04:46.551 --> 04:48.551
<i>Kayla dug down four feet</i>

04:48.551 --> 04:50.551
<i>to discover the route
to bedrock,</i>

04:50.551 --> 04:52.689
<i>blocked by huge boulders.</i>

04:52.689 --> 04:54.103
It's getting
to the point where

04:54.103 --> 04:55.655
I'm limited in what I can do.

04:56.413 --> 04:57.379
They're some big rocks

04:57.379 --> 04:59.000
that I can't get out
until we get a winch.

05:01.655 --> 05:04.689
<i>Now, the crew will
install the winch system.</i>

05:04.689 --> 05:05.724
We can get these up there.

05:05.724 --> 05:07.379
You guys are gonna bring
the generator up.

05:07.379 --> 05:08.379
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:08.379 --> 05:10.482
Once we're all up there,
we'll get these mounted.

05:10.482 --> 05:12.896
That way, tomorrow, we can
get you in the water pole.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.206
Right now...

05:14.206 --> 05:16.448
we can't get any depth because
we're locked in with rocks.

05:16.448 --> 05:18.724
So, once we get these mounted,
get that going,

05:18.724 --> 05:20.241
we can start pulling
the bigger rocks.

05:20.241 --> 05:22.103
Yeah.

05:22.103 --> 05:25.689
<i>Kayla and Scott
start the 1,100-foot hike in.</i>

05:26.724 --> 05:29.551
<i>Each with a 100-pound load
on their back.</i>

05:31.068 --> 05:32.517
This is the only
part that sucks, 'cause...

05:32.517 --> 05:33.551
Yeah, I know.

05:33.551 --> 05:34.551
It's really steep.

05:37.068 --> 05:38.034
<i>Just a month ago...</i>

05:39.517 --> 05:41.448
Woah, woah!

05:41.448 --> 05:42.655
Watch out, watch out.

05:42.655 --> 05:46.241
<i>...Kayla was struck
by a 300-pound boulder.</i>

05:46.241 --> 05:48.103
Are you
kidding me?

05:48.103 --> 05:49.206
Get her out of there.

05:51.793 --> 05:54.655
Well, my ankle's
still a little bit weird.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.655
I don't trust it
at steep angles.

06:07.172 --> 06:08.379
These ropes suck, huh?

06:10.172 --> 06:11.241
You need a hand, or...

06:11.241 --> 06:12.827
- I'm good.
- You good? Okay.

06:16.655 --> 06:18.310
These winches
weigh about a 100 pounds.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.655
So, she's almost hiking her
entire body weight right now.

06:22.103 --> 06:23.137
She's still getting it done.

06:24.344 --> 06:25.137
That's impressive.

06:33.965 --> 06:35.413
Well,
I hope I don't fall.

06:40.172 --> 06:40.965
I'm good.

06:42.275 --> 06:43.413
Just my ankle, that's all.

06:57.965 --> 06:58.758
Nice job.

06:59.689 --> 07:00.862
There.

07:00.862 --> 07:02.827
I'll take the weight back here
if you unstrap.

07:03.517 --> 07:04.931
- Got you.
- Thank you.

07:06.586 --> 07:07.448
I'm gonna
take a breather.

07:08.793 --> 07:09.586
Nice job.

07:12.206 --> 07:13.655
<i>To run the winches,</i>

07:13.655 --> 07:15.793
<i>the crew needs
the large generator</i>

07:15.793 --> 07:18.724
<i>that weighs in at more
than 140 pounds.</i>

07:20.068 --> 07:23.827
<i>Marine veteran Scott insists
on taking the load.</i>

07:25.172 --> 07:26.620
I feel like carrying
some heavy stuff.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.827
All right.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.068
It's a buckle.
Hang on.

07:31.068 --> 07:34.034
...put on the packs.

07:34.034 --> 07:35.482
It was like no good
angle at them.

07:42.103 --> 07:43.931
The pack is rubbing
my back raw.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.034
Oh, [bleep] dude.

07:45.034 --> 07:46.724
Oh, it's drain--
No, it's draining.

07:46.724 --> 07:47.931
I don't think
you're leaking gasoline.

07:47.931 --> 07:49.758
[bleep] Yeah,
it's going right down

07:49.758 --> 07:50.620
your [bleep].

07:50.620 --> 07:52.068
Help. Help me with it.

07:53.413 --> 07:54.206
That's burning.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh, that hurts!

08:02.275 --> 08:04.344
Where's your...

08:04.344 --> 08:05.551
It's around
here somewhere.

08:07.551 --> 08:09.517
Oh, [bleep] Okay.

08:09.517 --> 08:11.034
I think I'm gonna
have to get wet.

08:11.034 --> 08:12.310
You're gonna
have to get wet, dude.

08:12.310 --> 08:13.137
Yup.

08:15.517 --> 08:17.448
Okay. Okay. I got you.

08:18.586 --> 08:20.551
Yeah, I know.
That sucks, dude.

08:20.551 --> 08:22.068
I don't wanna rub it
too much, dude.

08:23.689 --> 08:26.724
<i>A 100 miles
from the nearest hospital,</i>

08:26.724 --> 08:29.413
<i>Scott is at risk
of chemical burns,</i>

08:29.413 --> 08:31.034
<i>taking him out of the game.</i>

08:31.827 --> 08:32.965
Is it still burning?

08:33.620 --> 08:34.827
It stings.

08:34.827 --> 08:37.344
It's like all the way down
on my left butt cheek.

08:37.344 --> 08:38.724
- Go shower up, dude.
- Yeah.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.724
<i>At Kayla's
dive site...</i>

08:48.724 --> 08:50.275
When the guys get back
with the generator,

08:50.275 --> 08:51.655
it's ready to go.

08:51.655 --> 08:54.137
<i>She's going it
alone with the upstream winch.</i>

08:56.034 --> 08:56.827
They're heavy.

08:58.586 --> 09:00.206
It's tricky.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.310
<i>It's a 60-foot
zig zag across the creek.</i>

09:08.793 --> 09:09.586
Try not to slip.

09:10.931 --> 09:13.137
damn it!

09:18.896 --> 09:20.724
There's one big boulder
right in the middle

09:20.724 --> 09:22.310
and I can't reach over it.

09:25.310 --> 09:26.482
Gonna go get an eye on her.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.655
She's trying to go across
to that winch.

09:31.206 --> 09:32.448
Are you gonna put this up?

09:33.551 --> 09:34.689
Yeah, I probably will.

09:34.689 --> 09:37.068
Do you wanna just
take it over there then?

09:37.068 --> 09:38.655
I can.
Will that be easier?

09:39.310 --> 09:40.310
Probably.

09:40.310 --> 09:42.482
Last thing I need to do
is fall in this water

09:42.482 --> 09:44.034
with a winch strapped
to my back.

09:44.034 --> 09:45.241
Yeah,
that would not be good.

09:45.241 --> 09:46.137
That's like a anchor.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.758
Now that we have
the winches here,

09:48.758 --> 09:50.275
the next step's
to get them mounted

09:50.275 --> 09:52.344
and get our cables strung up.

09:52.344 --> 09:54.931
That's gonna be a huge
game changer for us.

09:54.931 --> 09:56.586
<i>Now we're able to pull
the bigger rocks</i>

09:56.586 --> 09:58.000
without having to split them.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So, it's gonna be
a lot faster.

10:06.275 --> 10:08.758
<i>600 feet
down creek...</i>

10:08.758 --> 10:10.379
- Hey, buddy.
- What's up, man?

10:11.344 --> 10:12.793
<i>...the flooded
dredge motor</i>

10:12.793 --> 10:16.655
<i>is putting Dustin's first
dive of the season at risk.</i>

10:16.655 --> 10:18.275
Should I start getting
my gear together?

10:18.896 --> 10:19.724
Yeah, it's ready.

10:21.172 --> 10:22.448
Well, it's kind of
a sample fix

10:22.448 --> 10:24.862
but it was a waste of a couple
of hours.

10:24.862 --> 10:27.068
Just one more thing
in the line of crap out here

10:27.068 --> 10:28.758
in wild Alaska.

10:29.241 --> 10:30.275
And, go!

10:32.862 --> 10:35.068
Oh, but for all of us
to hear you.

10:36.758 --> 10:37.793
Yeah, buddy!

10:39.551 --> 10:42.241
Wooh! Smoking.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.241
Time to get suited up,
get in the water.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.206
I just wanna dive.

10:47.206 --> 10:48.655
If these guys would let me
dive every day,

10:48.655 --> 10:49.862
I'd dive every single day.

10:50.482 --> 10:52.034
Big hole, mines of gold.

10:53.689 --> 10:56.172
<i>After two hours
lost dive time,</i>

10:56.172 --> 10:59.068
<i>Dustin can finally go for gold</i>

10:59.068 --> 11:02.206
<i>in the most inaccessible
waters of nugget creek.</i>

11:03.758 --> 11:04.551
Let's do this.

11:06.034 --> 11:06.862
Water's good.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.517
Yeah, there it goes.

11:10.517 --> 11:12.655
It seems pretty hot,
want to put this last.

11:12.655 --> 11:13.586
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:15.862 --> 11:17.689
I'm excited
for my first dive, man.

11:17.689 --> 11:18.517
Me too.

11:20.724 --> 11:21.586
How's that breathing?

11:23.517 --> 11:24.689
That's it. Nailed it.

11:32.965 --> 11:34.000
Oh, all right.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.551
Let's see if I can get some
dredging down there.

11:37.103 --> 11:38.172
That's what we're here
for, right?

11:39.172 --> 11:40.724
Yeah, make a hole,
make a hole.

11:42.206 --> 11:43.344
Water's so crazy.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.344
My idea is...

11:48.413 --> 11:49.655
if I could follow the bedrock,

11:50.241 --> 11:51.068
on the wall,

11:53.482 --> 11:55.137
it's just gonna be
easier digging.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.758
At least I have one
that's bedrock

11:56.758 --> 11:57.827
that's not gonna fall on me.

11:59.413 --> 12:01.275
Copy that, copy that.
That makes sense.

12:01.275 --> 12:03.448
So, are you on bedrock
right now?

12:03.448 --> 12:05.827
I'm on the wall
and that's bedrock.

12:07.137 --> 12:09.379
Yeah, what I'm gonna do is,
try to follow this wall

12:09.379 --> 12:12.344
and that wall's gonna turn out
towards the center
of the creek

12:12.344 --> 12:13.206
at some point.

12:14.586 --> 12:16.034
And then, we'll know
what we're dealing with.

12:18.068 --> 12:19.000
<i>Last week,</i>

12:19.000 --> 12:21.758
<i>James and Carlos
dug down six feet</i>

12:21.758 --> 12:23.620
<i>near the granite
astronaut boulder.</i>

12:25.103 --> 12:26.689
<i>Dustin's plan,</i>

12:26.689 --> 12:30.034
<i>dig down beside bedrock
on the far creek wall,</i>

12:30.034 --> 12:33.655
<i>expand out to connect
to the existing dive hole</i>

12:33.655 --> 12:36.000
<i>to expose more
of the bedrock gold.</i>

12:40.896 --> 12:42.172
Instead of us
trying to like,

12:42.172 --> 12:44.034
pinpoint bedrock
in the middle of the creek

12:44.034 --> 12:45.068
where it's nice and calm,

12:45.965 --> 12:48.379
he went the most
roughest place.

12:49.206 --> 12:50.724
If I lift my head up,

12:50.724 --> 12:52.448
it wants to rip
my damn head off.

12:53.931 --> 12:55.793
There's tons of debris
right here.

12:59.103 --> 13:01.413
Ah, the
regulator's locking up.

13:05.344 --> 13:06.965
It's got a rock stuck
in it somewhere.

13:10.344 --> 13:13.275
<i>One hour in,
Dustin's equipment is failing</i>

13:13.275 --> 13:15.482
<i>in the furious creek waters.</i>

13:15.482 --> 13:17.517
<i>Without a functional regulator,</i>

13:17.517 --> 13:20.137
<i>his first dive is over.</i>

13:39.000 --> 13:41.620
<i>In the raging
waters of Nugget creek,</i>

13:41.620 --> 13:44.724
<i>Dustin's equipment is failing.</i>

13:44.724 --> 13:47.206
Ah, [bleep],
the regulator's locking up.

13:50.344 --> 13:51.896
It's got a rock stuck
in it somewhere.

13:53.034 --> 13:54.000
Ah!

13:55.793 --> 13:58.000
We gotta
take it apart, man.

13:59.586 --> 14:00.758
Be gentle.

14:00.758 --> 14:02.931
I can already breathe out
better now.

14:02.931 --> 14:04.689
It's just got a rock in it,
I know.

14:04.689 --> 14:07.448
I knew it's got a spring
in there and everything.

14:07.448 --> 14:09.793
It's all it is, just a little
rock stuck in that little...

14:09.793 --> 14:11.068
diaphragm somewhere.

14:11.068 --> 14:12.724
- Holy [bleep]!
- Yep, there you go.

14:12.724 --> 14:13.896
- Look at all that.
- That is...

14:13.896 --> 14:15.551
Keep... Dump it out.
Like, bang it out.

14:17.517 --> 14:20.379
- It was stopping me from
breathing, dude.
- Yeah.

14:20.379 --> 14:22.241
I could breathe in,
but I couldn't breathe out.

14:22.241 --> 14:23.344
It was awful.

14:24.517 --> 14:26.103
<i>In search
of a quick fix</i>

14:26.103 --> 14:27.793
<i>to get Dustin
back in the water,</i>

14:28.965 --> 14:30.206
<i>Carlos gets creative.</i>

14:31.206 --> 14:33.344
Women's pantyhose.

14:33.344 --> 14:35.551
<i>That, my friends,
is a quick push fix.</i>

14:39.793 --> 14:43.034
Getting air out of the mask
is impossible

14:43.034 --> 14:45.137
when it gets rocks stuck
in a little diaphragm.

14:47.068 --> 14:48.310
All right, let's gesture out.

14:52.448 --> 14:53.206
All right, let's...

14:54.655 --> 14:56.655
Yeah. So much better, dude.

15:02.172 --> 15:04.965
We are in serious business
of dredging.

15:05.620 --> 15:06.586
Hope with all that dredge,

15:06.586 --> 15:09.068
man, all our prayers
go for gold, gold, gold.

15:10.448 --> 15:12.379
Yeah, there's a lot
of rocks floating around.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.896
I got giants
over the top of me,

15:16.896 --> 15:18.068
right upstream too.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.758
I'm under

15:23.172 --> 15:24.862
That pulp right there...

15:26.310 --> 15:28.758
is a big boulder that wants
to kill me, right here.

15:31.068 --> 15:33.586
And I need to center pop
that [bleep].

15:35.206 --> 15:37.310
<i>While clearing
four feet of gravel</i>

15:37.310 --> 15:38.965
<i>beside the bedrock wall,</i>

15:38.965 --> 15:42.000
<i>Dustin's undermined
a huge widowmaker.</i>

15:42.793 --> 15:43.586
If it falls...

15:45.344 --> 15:46.206
<i>it could crush him.</i>

15:50.310 --> 15:52.275
I don't know what's gonna
happen with the popping,

15:52.275 --> 15:53.689
but it needs to go.

15:54.655 --> 15:56.206
It's over my head, man.

15:59.344 --> 16:01.172
This creek
changes all the time.

16:01.172 --> 16:03.068
If you move one boulder,

16:03.068 --> 16:05.379
you have no idea
what that might do.

16:05.379 --> 16:08.620
It might speed up the water,
where you're dredging.

16:09.172 --> 16:10.344
You have no idea.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.827
[bleep] How do I get
into this [bleep]?

16:20.517 --> 16:23.068
That's a huge boulder.
I don't think it's gonna move.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
But I'd love to crack it.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.931
This is so stupid.

16:30.931 --> 16:32.275
Oh, I see.
You're trying to make

16:32.275 --> 16:34.551
water block
with your body, I got it.

16:34.551 --> 16:36.275
Do you think you
could find a better spot,

16:36.275 --> 16:38.758
the hardest spot to drill?

16:38.758 --> 16:40.413
I think we're just
gonna pop it like this, y'all.

16:41.379 --> 16:42.724
Let's see what happens.

16:42.724 --> 16:44.068
Yeah, I'm getting
my ass kicked.

16:48.172 --> 16:49.620
Get the hell out of here.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.241
Watch your blue cord.
Watch your blue cord.

16:53.241 --> 16:54.137
Watch the blue cord.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.793
Crack it.

16:57.827 --> 16:59.000
Crack it.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.482
Three, two, one...

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I just busted right
through that sucker.

17:08.931 --> 17:10.068
That was perfect!

17:11.586 --> 17:13.172
I can't get anywhere
because of all these

17:13.172 --> 17:15.620
broken [bleep] pieces
we put down here.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.137
While the winches
are running, man,

17:17.137 --> 17:19.413
we can choke them out
of there, if we need to.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.344
Gonna try.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.965
Okay, I'll bring
the ball back up there close

17:22.965 --> 17:23.793
so you can deal with it.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.793
<i>Dustin's crew
installed their winch system</i>

17:29.793 --> 17:31.241
<i>two weeks ahead of Kayla.</i>

17:32.448 --> 17:35.482
<i>It's capable of pulling
6,000 pound boulders</i>

17:35.482 --> 17:36.344
<i>from the creek bed.</i>

17:38.724 --> 17:40.275
It's off now,
off the bottom.

17:43.448 --> 17:44.275
Yeah!

17:45.517 --> 17:47.206
Yeah!

17:55.965 --> 17:58.241
We got some good
real estate here.

18:06.448 --> 18:08.310
Is it standable?

18:08.310 --> 18:10.275
It's a bit strong
right here on the current.

18:11.344 --> 18:13.241
<i>500 feet
up the creek,</i>

18:13.241 --> 18:16.275
<i>Kayla's upstream
winch is in place.</i>

18:16.275 --> 18:19.379
<i>Now, she and Paul just have
the downstream winch</i>

18:19.379 --> 18:20.206
<i>to install.</i>

18:21.862 --> 18:24.172
You need me to hold it
in place while you
get up there?

18:24.172 --> 18:26.310
Yeah,
you probably will have to.

18:26.310 --> 18:28.482
<i>Three hours
after his accident,</i>

18:28.482 --> 18:30.965
<i>Scott is back
at the dive site.</i>

18:32.310 --> 18:33.068
All right.

18:34.827 --> 18:35.620
Kayla!

18:39.931 --> 18:41.241
- That color.
- I heard.

18:41.758 --> 18:42.551
Yeah.

18:44.655 --> 18:46.275
Oh, man! We are close.

18:46.275 --> 18:50.034
Just gotta manipulate
a couple little bolts.

18:50.034 --> 18:51.689
And we're gonna have
us a downstream winch.

18:51.689 --> 18:52.931
We can start pulling
rocks now.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.172
Don't drop your nuts.

18:57.172 --> 18:58.931
They dropped
a long time ago!

19:01.379 --> 19:03.000
That's not
what she said.

19:04.137 --> 19:05.517
That went on
really fast.

19:05.517 --> 19:07.413
We needed
something to go right.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.275
So, first thing
tomorrow morning,

19:09.275 --> 19:11.241
we'll try to get us pulled up.

19:11.241 --> 19:13.172
Hopefully, we can get that
done in a decent time

19:13.172 --> 19:15.241
and still get Paul
in the water to get
a good dive in.

19:15.931 --> 19:17.379
You know what that means?

19:17.379 --> 19:19.068
We have one thing left.

19:19.862 --> 19:20.965
One thing.

19:20.965 --> 19:23.965
And we are at full capacity
in full dredge mode

19:23.965 --> 19:25.413
in gold!

19:29.551 --> 19:31.827
<i>Down creek
at the Golden Gate site...</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:34.379
How's
the box looking?

19:36.275 --> 19:39.241
Sending some good
material over, man.

19:39.241 --> 19:41.896
<i>After four hours
widening the dive hole,</i>

19:41.896 --> 19:44.000
<i>and sending gravel
through the sluice...</i>

19:45.241 --> 19:46.793
I gotta get out.

19:46.793 --> 19:48.103
<i>...Dustin
calls time.</i>

19:51.034 --> 19:52.724
I am tired.
I didn't realize.

19:55.793 --> 19:57.103
Fresh air.

19:59.379 --> 20:00.137
Good dive.

20:01.931 --> 20:02.724
You seeing gold?

20:04.517 --> 20:05.482
We got rocks in them.

20:06.172 --> 20:06.965
No gold.

20:08.379 --> 20:09.758
I just had a great dive

20:09.758 --> 20:11.931
and I can't wait to see
what's under these

20:11.931 --> 20:14.241
huge boulders
underneath there.

20:14.241 --> 20:16.724
And I want James
to get through them,

20:16.724 --> 20:18.206
dredge underneath them,

20:18.206 --> 20:20.241
and see if there's
any paydays.

20:20.241 --> 20:22.413
I hope they're sitting
on bedrock, honestly.

20:22.413 --> 20:23.379
I think they might be.

20:38.793 --> 20:40.724
<i>At Kayla's
dive site...</i>

20:40.724 --> 20:42.379
My first dive here
at Nugget Creek.

20:43.172 --> 20:44.413
I'm a little excited to get in

20:44.413 --> 20:45.896
and see what
it's all about here.

20:46.724 --> 20:48.310
<i>Winches in place,</i>

20:48.310 --> 20:51.206
<i>Scott and Justin must now
thread the cable</i>

20:51.206 --> 20:54.931
<i>capable of pulling
over 6,000 pounds</i>

20:54.931 --> 20:58.379
<i>before Paul can begin
his battle with the boulders.</i>

20:58.379 --> 21:00.620
We're starting to get
this area opened up.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.068
We get a little bit
further ahead,

21:02.068 --> 21:03.103
get some of these rocks out,

21:03.103 --> 21:04.517
then we can focus on...

21:04.517 --> 21:06.586
trying to go down and see
if we can find bedrock.

21:08.206 --> 21:09.965
If we can find some
gold today...

21:14.379 --> 21:15.310
it's gonna be a good day.

21:17.482 --> 21:19.344
So far, it seems
like things are going

21:19.344 --> 21:21.103
a bit more smoothly.

21:21.103 --> 21:22.689
So, if those winches
are working,

21:22.689 --> 21:23.758
with Paul in the water,

21:23.758 --> 21:25.793
we should be able to move
a lot of material today.

21:25.793 --> 21:26.931
Which we definitely need.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.000
We need that break.

21:34.241 --> 21:35.000
How's your air?

21:37.034 --> 21:38.482
- It's good.
- Good.

21:38.482 --> 21:39.551
All right, you're good to go.

21:40.241 --> 21:41.000
Here we go.

21:45.068 --> 21:46.586
Yeah, it's not very
deep right here.

21:49.586 --> 21:51.413
Right here is where you
were dredging, right?

21:51.413 --> 21:53.034
Yeah, all right here.

21:53.034 --> 21:54.896
Okay. It might have
filled in a little bit.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.241
Well, I have
this little crate

21:56.241 --> 21:58.758
if you ever wanna set it
in front here that you
could fill up

21:58.758 --> 22:00.000
and then I can move
the rocks for you

22:00.000 --> 22:01.172
till we get the winches going.

22:01.172 --> 22:02.000
Okay.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.103
<i>Last week,
at just a few feet down,</i>

22:06.103 --> 22:08.620
<i>Kayla hit a layer
of heavy boulders,</i>

22:08.620 --> 22:10.896
<i>making it impossible
to go any deeper</i>

22:10.896 --> 22:12.034
<i>to bedrock gold.</i>

22:15.862 --> 22:17.965
<i>Until the winches are running,</i>

22:17.965 --> 22:20.758
<i>Paul and Kayla can only
remove smaller boulders</i>

22:20.758 --> 22:21.620
<i>by hand.</i>

22:25.172 --> 22:28.034
I'm basically
being the human winch

22:28.034 --> 22:29.310
in moving all the rocks.

22:30.655 --> 22:31.862
Which is pretty tiring.

22:36.034 --> 22:37.413
Made that rock my [bleep].

22:39.620 --> 22:42.034
Paul is dredging.
He's making a lot of progress.

22:42.034 --> 22:43.172
There's big rocks in there.

22:43.172 --> 22:46.275
So, it's hard to get any real
depth going right now.

22:46.275 --> 22:48.551
But we're still
getting a lot done

22:48.551 --> 22:50.517
despite the hardships
that we're having.

22:52.482 --> 22:53.379
Far as I can see,

22:54.103 --> 22:54.965
about four inches.

22:55.965 --> 22:57.137
And it's not pitch black.

23:00.620 --> 23:01.758
We're done up
here, bro.

23:02.620 --> 23:04.206
Let's see
how that looks.

23:05.689 --> 23:07.000
Woah, woah! Watch out.

23:07.827 --> 23:08.931
That was right
against my head.

23:11.068 --> 23:13.103
Scott, can you talk
when you're doing stuff,

23:13.103 --> 23:14.620
so Paul can hear you?

23:14.620 --> 23:17.034
He didn't know what was going
on when that cable flung up.

23:17.965 --> 23:20.379
Yeah, that is
a 1,000 per cent my bad.

23:21.310 --> 23:22.068
Sorry, Paul.

23:23.551 --> 23:24.793
I still got my head.
I'm good.

23:26.896 --> 23:27.896
You didn't rip
my head off, yet.

23:28.931 --> 23:30.137
[bleep] sorry, man.

23:30.586 --> 23:31.379
I'm sorry.

23:33.241 --> 23:35.172
Paul, we're gonna
pull the line up.

23:35.724 --> 23:36.482
<i>Yes.</i>

23:38.275 --> 23:40.586
We're gonna get that
headache ball to him,

23:40.586 --> 23:42.206
so that way, he can
hook up a boulder

23:42.206 --> 23:44.482
and hopefully, we'll see this
thing, pull it out successfully.

23:51.172 --> 23:52.655
Okay,
it's hooked this time.

23:57.551 --> 23:58.931
Oh, look at that.

24:00.379 --> 24:02.172
Wooh! That's a good one.

24:03.689 --> 24:05.206
That definitely
got rid of that rock.

24:07.103 --> 24:08.620
That's gonna open up
some territory.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.103
It's at least three foot,
four foot deeper.

24:13.344 --> 24:15.965
Paul's getting some more
depth added to the hole.

24:15.965 --> 24:18.551
So far, we've had
a really good day.

24:18.551 --> 24:20.034
Fingers crossed
it stays that way.

24:30.551 --> 24:31.586
I think we're good
to go, James.

24:31.586 --> 24:33.344
That water's freaking
nice and boiling.

24:34.344 --> 24:36.206
Thank you. Awesome.
I appreciate it.

24:38.137 --> 24:39.793
<i>At the Golden
Gate site,</i>

24:39.793 --> 24:42.758
<i>after Dustin widened
the dive hole,</i>

24:42.758 --> 24:46.827
<i>today, James will take on
the massive asteroid boulder</i>

24:46.827 --> 24:48.827
<i>over-hanging the dig.</i>

24:48.827 --> 24:50.827
I had a dream that
I found two nuggets.

24:51.586 --> 24:52.827
Let's hope it comes true.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.000
I'm looking forward
to the dive.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.137
I wanna be able to dredge

24:57.137 --> 25:00.103
and pop rocks
and move boulders.

25:00.103 --> 25:02.000
And get the material out.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.620
I just wanna be able to...

25:03.620 --> 25:04.931
get down deep today.

25:07.241 --> 25:08.620
You guys got my back, right?

25:08.620 --> 25:10.275
Yeah, baby.
We got you.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.793
Okay.

25:11.793 --> 25:13.793
We need to get rid
of that big asteroid rock.

25:22.413 --> 25:23.655
It's on the surface, I feel.

25:23.655 --> 25:25.551
Go up and feel
what's above you.

25:28.275 --> 25:31.448
This asteroid rock
is something else.

25:31.448 --> 25:34.034
I wanted you to know,
it's above your head,
all right?

25:34.034 --> 25:35.655
I'd get rid
of that sucker.

25:36.758 --> 25:39.000
This rock keeps going down,
holy crap!

25:41.206 --> 25:42.793
<i>James' mission,</i>

25:42.793 --> 25:46.000
<i>blast off sections
of the 20,000-pound</i>

25:46.000 --> 25:49.965
<i>asteroid boulder overhanging

25:50.862 --> 25:52.379
<i>Danger removed,</i>

25:52.379 --> 25:54.655
<i>James can get back
to digging down</i>

25:54.655 --> 25:55.896
<i>to bedrock gold.</i>

26:03.517 --> 26:06.068
Good catch, Ben. I got you
set up for two chargers.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.689
Right now, we're making
the most progress

26:10.689 --> 26:12.206
we can possibly make.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.344
How's your
water doing, man?

26:23.896 --> 26:25.310
You know you can
talk to me, right?

26:27.034 --> 26:28.448
I don't know why
I'm not talking as much

26:28.448 --> 26:31.068
'cause I'm more focused on
thinking about what I'm doing.

26:32.344 --> 26:34.862
'Cause it's dangerous
down here.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.551
One rock at a time,
that's all you're focused on.

26:40.379 --> 26:42.517
I can't find
the freaking hole I drilled.

26:50.344 --> 26:51.517
Water's pretty hot.

26:53.034 --> 26:54.620
<i>A sudden rise
in temperature</i>

26:54.620 --> 26:56.413
<i>in James' dive suit</i>

26:56.413 --> 26:58.103
<i>is a dangerous sign.</i>

26:58.103 --> 27:01.517
<i>The heating system relies
on a constant flow of water.</i>

27:02.655 --> 27:04.448
<i>A blockage in the filters</i>

27:04.448 --> 27:06.655
<i>means less water
in the heat exchange.</i>

27:08.103 --> 27:10.931
<i>Which then turns into
superheated steam</i>

27:11.931 --> 27:13.655
<i>that will surge down</i>

27:13.655 --> 27:15.413
<i>into James' dive suit.</i>

27:19.724 --> 27:20.896
Hey, why don't you piss out,

27:20.896 --> 27:22.000
come up,
we'll give it a check.

27:24.827 --> 27:26.413
Hey!

27:26.413 --> 27:27.862
Come here!

27:27.862 --> 27:29.068
This it's about
to get too hot.

27:41.758 --> 27:42.793
Something's wrong.

27:42.793 --> 27:43.862
We made
a half inch dredge.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.551
This one
was about to burn.

27:45.551 --> 27:46.448
I could smell it.

27:47.482 --> 27:50.172
<i>At Dustin's
Golden Gate site,</i>

27:50.172 --> 27:52.379
<i>the raging water
of Nugget Creek</i>

27:52.379 --> 27:54.275
<i>pushes the crew
and the equipment</i>

27:54.896 --> 27:56.689
<i>to the limit.</i>

27:56.689 --> 27:58.724
This is the one
that's getting hot over here.

27:59.551 --> 28:01.103
I can smell it.

28:01.103 --> 28:03.068
<i>For the second
time this week,</i>

28:03.068 --> 28:05.000
<i>a dive is on hold.</i>

28:06.241 --> 28:08.034
<i>The dredge is overheating,</i>

28:08.034 --> 28:10.517
<i>putting James at risk
of being burned</i>

28:10.517 --> 28:12.344
<i>by superheated steam.</i>

28:12.344 --> 28:13.482
Thanks
for catching it.

28:13.482 --> 28:15.103
This water's...

28:15.103 --> 28:16.275
a tough one to deal with.

28:17.344 --> 28:19.103
We're just trying
to keep you safe, man.

28:19.103 --> 28:20.206
Yeah.

28:20.206 --> 28:22.275
<i>The mission
to blast off sections</i>

28:22.275 --> 28:24.137
<i>of the asteroid boulder</i>

28:24.137 --> 28:25.310
<i>is at a standstill.</i>

28:27.172 --> 28:28.862
Can't figure out
what's happening

28:28.862 --> 28:32.241
but we're getting particulates
inside of our heaters,

28:32.241 --> 28:33.965
and we have
good filter systems.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.275
We may have just
wore these out.

28:37.275 --> 28:39.034
Or there's something wrong
with our filter system.

28:39.034 --> 28:40.862
I can't figure it out,
to tell you the truth.

28:41.793 --> 28:43.793
<i>Wes' temporary fix,</i>

28:43.793 --> 28:45.655
<i>re-plum the dredge,</i>

28:45.655 --> 28:48.482
<i>sending the creek water
around the exhaust chamber</i>

28:48.482 --> 28:51.034
<i>of just one of the two motors.</i>

28:51.034 --> 28:52.551
It'll be real
easy just to...

28:52.551 --> 28:55.724
start shutting down the ...
and then, we can
figure it out.

28:55.724 --> 28:58.103
<i>Reducing the heat
will protect James</i>

28:58.103 --> 28:59.793
<i>from serious burns.</i>

28:59.793 --> 29:02.793
<i>But could put him at risk
of hypothermia</i>

29:02.793 --> 29:05.448
<i>in the 38-degree water
of Nugget Creek.</i>

29:06.896 --> 29:08.034
I would dive with this.

29:09.655 --> 29:10.448
Let's try it out.

29:12.034 --> 29:12.827
All right.

29:22.379 --> 29:23.137
How does it feel?

29:25.275 --> 29:26.206
Getting there.

29:26.206 --> 29:27.551
Warm on my back.

29:27.551 --> 29:29.689
But not on my chest, yet.

29:31.413 --> 29:32.827
I gotta wiggle around,
I guess.

29:33.827 --> 29:35.310
Hey, I don't know
what to do, man.

29:35.310 --> 29:37.517
It's all I got right now,
not to burn you up.

29:40.310 --> 29:41.551
James' a tough guy,

29:41.551 --> 29:44.137
so, he's not gonna admit that
he's suffering down there.

29:46.620 --> 29:47.689
[bleep] this boulder.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.068
I'm gonna try plan B.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.206
I think he's digging
straight down

29:53.206 --> 29:54.482
behind the asteroid rock.

29:55.965 --> 29:57.620
He didn't listen to me,
it's okay.

29:58.172 --> 29:59.275
Y'all usually don't.

30:00.172 --> 30:01.379
Why don't you
just [bleep] dig it?

30:02.827 --> 30:05.862
<i>Undermining the granite asteroid boulder</i>

30:05.862 --> 30:07.689
<i>is a high-risk strategy.</i>

30:08.827 --> 30:10.551
that hurt.

30:12.000 --> 30:12.827
You okay?

30:12.827 --> 30:14.103
I got bit.

30:14.965 --> 30:15.931
that hurt.

30:19.931 --> 30:22.758
<i>James smashed
his hand into a granite shard.</i>

30:24.655 --> 30:25.551
You want gold?

30:25.551 --> 30:27.000
It's gonna give you
a freaking battle.

30:30.206 --> 30:33.275
The battle's on, man.
It's always been on.

30:33.275 --> 30:35.724
It's win-lose,
win-lose, win-lose.

30:35.724 --> 30:36.724
It's a war, man.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.103
Yeah!

30:47.241 --> 30:49.172
Good job, man! Awesome, dude.

30:50.172 --> 30:51.068
Hell, yeah!

30:54.482 --> 30:55.931
How you doing
down there, buddy?

30:55.931 --> 30:57.241
Pretty good.

30:57.241 --> 30:58.655
Just digging and digging.

30:59.965 --> 31:00.827
Copy that.

31:03.517 --> 31:05.758
If you listen close enough,

31:05.758 --> 31:08.827
you could hear, he's pulling
through his teeth almost,

31:08.827 --> 31:09.793
because he's cold.

31:10.517 --> 31:11.655
It's subtle,

31:11.655 --> 31:14.724
but I've been listening
to him breath for years now.

31:14.724 --> 31:15.931
And I know everyone's breath

31:15.931 --> 31:17.724
and how they feel
when they're doing it.

31:17.724 --> 31:18.965
It's like a different language

31:18.965 --> 31:20.586
when you listen
to somebody breath

31:20.586 --> 31:21.793
all the damn time.

31:23.862 --> 31:25.379
How's your water?

31:25.379 --> 31:26.379
I'm getting
pretty cold.

31:28.034 --> 31:29.137
Time to come up.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.689
Yeah.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.000
All right,
get out of there.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
We'll come, grab you up.

31:37.413 --> 31:38.586
All the reason.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.344
Good job, brother. Good time.

31:44.344 --> 31:45.206
Hold that for me.

31:46.344 --> 31:47.137
Good dive, brother.

31:48.965 --> 31:50.586
That was the scary
one down there.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.103
Had a fear of being
behind that asteroid boulder

31:54.103 --> 31:55.896
and it starts moving...

31:55.896 --> 31:58.551
because I undermined
everything over there.

31:58.551 --> 32:01.482
Deeper I go, settle in on me
and next thing you know,

32:01.482 --> 32:02.310
I'm dead.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.965
James is on a mission

32:04.965 --> 32:06.379
and he wants to go
straight down.

32:06.379 --> 32:07.413
So...

32:07.413 --> 32:09.034
he didn't crack the rock
that I wanted

32:09.034 --> 32:12.000
but he a big damn hole
and he moved a lot of rock.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.344
So, he wants to go straight
down to the bottom.

32:14.344 --> 32:15.862
I understand,
that's all of us.

32:15.862 --> 32:17.379
We wanna go straight down.

32:17.379 --> 32:18.551
It gets dangerous.

32:19.586 --> 32:20.586
It's a good way to die.

32:21.206 --> 32:22.482
A real good way to die.

32:34.482 --> 32:37.551
Up creek,
at Kayla's dive site...

32:37.551 --> 32:38.862
How you
doing there, Paul?

32:38.862 --> 32:40.482
Get a little bit
of depth going.

32:40.482 --> 32:42.931
Raw spots on my hands...

32:44.655 --> 32:47.206
<i>After six hours
hauling out rocks,</i>

32:47.206 --> 32:48.931
<i>Paul is down to five feet.</i>

32:51.551 --> 32:53.965
All right, Paul, you
wanna go ahead and come up?

32:53.965 --> 32:54.793
Yeah.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.241
It's like a big task.

33:02.586 --> 33:03.620
You had
a good dive today.

33:06.965 --> 33:09.655
We did make some progress
as far as the depth.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.413
These boulders are so
locked in here right now.

33:12.413 --> 33:14.482
It's taking a lot
to get them apart.

33:14.482 --> 33:16.827
Everything feels
like concrete.

33:16.827 --> 33:19.310
So, all my time
in McKinley dredging,

33:19.310 --> 33:20.551
I've never experienced this

33:20.551 --> 33:22.310
except for when we were
on bedrock.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.206
To me, it's a good sign,
because if it's like this,

33:26.206 --> 33:28.620
I don't think this
has been touched.

33:28.620 --> 33:31.896
<i>It's more
challenging than
any other claim.</i>

33:31.896 --> 33:34.965
<i>But the huge boulders
of Nugget Creek promise</i>

33:34.965 --> 33:36.241
<i>the greatest reward.</i>

33:37.655 --> 33:39.275
I saw a couple little flakes.

33:39.275 --> 33:40.275
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:40.827 --> 33:41.620
yeah!

33:42.689 --> 33:44.000
She found some
flakes in there.

33:44.793 --> 33:45.586
Oh,

33:46.896 --> 33:47.689
There's another one.

33:49.896 --> 33:51.413
The deeper we go,
the better it should get.

33:54.827 --> 33:57.068
Well, it's not enough
to justify

33:57.068 --> 33:59.310
all the work that we've done
or pay any bills

33:59.310 --> 34:00.344
or anything like that.

34:01.172 --> 34:02.827
It's a good sign that

34:02.827 --> 34:04.965
there could be a lot better
stuff waiting down below.

34:17.724 --> 34:18.689
We go several feet

34:18.689 --> 34:20.620
and it's already
getting like, harder.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.931
Not like hard packed per se,
but like...

34:22.931 --> 34:24.724
- Just locked together.
- Just more locked in.

34:24.724 --> 34:26.379
- Awesome.
- And not touched.

34:26.379 --> 34:29.344
That's... Yeah,
that's the impression I got

34:29.344 --> 34:30.275
when I saw that.

34:30.275 --> 34:31.310
It's like, it's never
been touched.

34:31.310 --> 34:33.103
'Cause this is nothing
like McKinley.

34:33.103 --> 34:35.103
It was like the bottom
three feet of McKinley.

34:35.103 --> 34:36.551
And with that,
we're really hopeful

34:36.551 --> 34:38.896
that we're gonna find some
really good gold here
this year.

34:38.896 --> 34:40.344
I hope that
you're right there.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.862
I'm so excited for your guys.

34:44.034 --> 34:46.689
I'm guessing we're about
twice as deep as you guys.

34:46.689 --> 34:48.137
I think your site's
gonna be deeper.

34:48.137 --> 34:49.448
It's gonna be much deeper.

34:49.448 --> 34:51.862
You guys are gonna bust
in the bedrock before
us, probably

34:51.862 --> 34:53.827
'cause we have such
huge damn rocks.

34:55.586 --> 34:56.655
Let's try to hit bedrock.

34:56.655 --> 34:59.689
I truly believe it's only
eight to ten feet tops.

35:00.448 --> 35:02.482
Like, that's what I believe.

35:02.482 --> 35:04.310
That's what I've been told
all the way across the board.

35:05.379 --> 35:07.206
We got to find the bottom
of this thing

35:07.206 --> 35:08.310
and see if there's any gold.

35:09.551 --> 35:10.724
Everybody, pay attention.

35:11.758 --> 35:13.724
Let's get down to bedrock.
Y'all ready?

35:13.724 --> 35:15.206
All right. Let's get going.

35:22.724 --> 35:24.689
<i>At Dustin's
Golden Gate site...</i>

35:25.448 --> 35:27.103
Ready
for you, Carlos.

35:27.103 --> 35:29.034
I'm just getting
all this stuff ready, dude.

35:29.034 --> 35:30.068
I love you, man!

35:30.068 --> 35:31.103
But get in the [bleep] water.

35:32.689 --> 35:34.862
<i>Next to dive
is Carlos.</i>

35:34.862 --> 35:36.931
<i>His mission is to go
head-to-head</i>

35:36.931 --> 35:38.310
<i>with the asteroid boulder.</i>

35:38.965 --> 35:39.793
As always man,

35:39.793 --> 35:41.896
keep your nose going and...

35:41.896 --> 35:43.655
temperature change on me,
I'm coming up.

35:43.655 --> 35:44.586
I got you!

35:44.586 --> 35:46.724
Go down and dig.
Do what you do.

35:46.724 --> 35:48.758
Move as many big rocks
as you can.

35:48.758 --> 35:50.586
The more big rocks
you get out of there,

35:50.586 --> 35:51.655
the deeper we can go.

35:52.931 --> 35:55.275
Pretty sure that you're gonna
get on some gold today.

35:56.517 --> 35:57.413
Let's go diving.

36:00.206 --> 36:01.034
Diver in the water.

36:03.206 --> 36:04.896
Okay. Got a pretty
good size hole.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.620
It's a lot of kitty litter,
as we expected.

36:07.482 --> 36:08.379
Oh, you mother...

36:09.103 --> 36:09.931
I got bit.

36:09.931 --> 36:11.068
You bastard!

36:11.068 --> 36:12.827
Definitely gonna do
some blasting today.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.034
<i>Yesterday,
James ignored Dustin</i>

36:17.034 --> 36:19.206
<i>and dug straight
down underneath</i>

36:19.206 --> 36:21.551
<i>the 20,000-pound boulder,</i>

36:21.551 --> 36:24.137
<i>deepening the dive hole
to eight feet.</i>

36:24.137 --> 36:25.965
<i>Removing the overhang</i>

36:25.965 --> 36:27.965
<i>is the only way
to make it safe</i>

36:27.965 --> 36:30.068
<i>for Carlos to dredge
down deeper</i>

36:30.068 --> 36:31.103
<i>to bedrock gold.</i>

36:32.965 --> 36:34.482
About the asteroid
boulder, man...

36:36.241 --> 36:37.517
they're dangerous, dude.

36:37.517 --> 36:38.793
That's it, right here.

36:38.793 --> 36:40.241
Those are
the asteroid boulders.

36:42.206 --> 36:43.275
If I could start drilling...

36:44.172 --> 36:45.517
I got a drill
ready for you.

36:46.689 --> 36:47.482
All right.

36:55.862 --> 36:58.379
All right guys, I'm ready
for those powerheads.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.103
Go for the pop!

37:14.931 --> 37:15.724
Go!

37:21.655 --> 37:22.620
Oh, yeah.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.137
That opened up a lot of rocks.

37:26.103 --> 37:27.241
You might choke on that.

37:27.241 --> 37:28.586
I gotta pick it right here.

37:29.689 --> 37:31.413
Is it a double winch
or a single?

37:36.448 --> 37:38.482
- Let's find out.
- Yeah, let's find out.

37:40.862 --> 37:41.655
Yeah!

37:46.482 --> 37:47.965
I'm ready to go.

37:47.965 --> 37:49.448
All right,
here we go. Move it.

37:50.275 --> 37:51.034
All right.

37:56.034 --> 37:57.655
Oh, you get some
head weight. Yeah!

37:57.655 --> 37:58.482
Yeah!

38:02.000 --> 38:03.793
That's that asteroid.

38:05.551 --> 38:06.517
Wow!

38:06.517 --> 38:08.137
Look at that.

38:08.137 --> 38:10.448
Good [bleep], Wes.
Good [bleep], man.

38:10.448 --> 38:11.931
Nice hook. Nice hook.

38:14.172 --> 38:16.275
That is a big part
of the asteroid rock.

38:16.275 --> 38:17.655
It was very deep underneath.

38:18.275 --> 38:19.413
It's such a big boulder.

38:19.413 --> 38:21.517
It's definitely gonna be
gold all around it.

38:21.517 --> 38:23.551
The deeper we get
around that asteroid boulder,

38:23.551 --> 38:24.758
we're gonna get bigger gold.

38:35.586 --> 38:37.448
Get a little excited
about getting in the...

38:37.448 --> 38:39.034
Nugget Creek
for the first time?

38:39.034 --> 38:41.206
I'm finally
back to being excited.

38:41.206 --> 38:43.482
I'm ready to get
in this water, dude.

38:43.482 --> 38:46.275
<i>After dredging
the first flakes of gold</i>

38:46.275 --> 38:48.896
<i>in the shallows
of Kayla's site,</i>

38:48.896 --> 38:52.965
<i>Scott is next on the trail
of bigger tressure below.</i>

38:52.965 --> 38:54.965
I mean,
it's go time, y'all.

38:56.758 --> 38:58.965
With a fire under my ass
to get into the water,

38:58.965 --> 39:00.931
get those boulders
out of the way,

39:00.931 --> 39:02.344
and get down some depth...

39:02.344 --> 39:03.724
try to push for bedrock.

39:03.724 --> 39:05.172
Awesome if I hit
bedrock today.

39:07.275 --> 39:09.482
I'm gonna get gold today.
It's gonna be all worthwhile.

39:09.482 --> 39:10.482
I'm gonna get gold.

39:18.551 --> 39:20.448
You said you had a hole here.

39:23.310 --> 39:24.448
Must have
filled back in.

39:27.206 --> 39:30.206
<i>Overnight,
the fast flowing creek</i>

39:30.206 --> 39:32.448
<i>has filled the hole
with loose gravel</i>

39:32.965 --> 39:34.379
<i>and boulders.</i>

39:34.379 --> 39:35.517
This one
has them stuck.

39:37.551 --> 39:39.413
No. Once I get this out,

39:40.413 --> 39:41.827
I can go...

39:41.827 --> 39:43.206
Can you feel
how far back it goes?

39:44.586 --> 39:45.379
I can move it.

39:45.896 --> 39:46.793
It's loose.

39:47.448 --> 39:48.793
It's definitely loose.

39:48.793 --> 39:50.724
I can get around it,
I can choke it quite easily.

39:51.896 --> 39:53.034
Did you choke her?

39:53.034 --> 39:54.931
See if we can pull this rock
over the damn.

39:54.931 --> 39:56.068
Come down
on me a little bit.

39:57.068 --> 39:57.862
That's good, that's good.

39:58.862 --> 40:00.000
All right, come up...

40:03.586 --> 40:05.000
You might have lost it,
I don't know.

40:05.689 --> 40:06.724
I don't think so.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.413
Looks like it's working good.

40:16.448 --> 40:17.620
It's working good.

40:19.206 --> 40:20.827
Look at that.

40:20.827 --> 40:22.620
We can pull that rock
wherever I want to.

40:25.586 --> 40:26.827
That's a game changer.

40:41.448 --> 40:43.655
<i>In the freezing
water of Nugget Creek...</i>

40:45.000 --> 40:46.241
Ah, [bleep]!

40:46.241 --> 40:47.827
<i>...Scott
is in trouble.</i>

40:47.827 --> 40:48.896
Oh, [bleep]!

40:49.586 --> 40:50.482
What's wrong?

40:50.482 --> 40:52.000
It just stole
my [bleep] shoe.

40:53.344 --> 40:54.413
Scott lost his shoe.

40:56.034 --> 41:01.034
I can't find it.

41:01.034 --> 41:02.551
Are you ticklish?

41:03.758 --> 41:05.655
I am extremely
ticklish on my feet.

41:07.758 --> 41:08.758
Oh, don't do that.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.724
I'm really ticklish,
this is not fair.

41:10.724 --> 41:12.103
I'd get it for you,
but I can't.

41:13.275 --> 41:14.137
That's not fair.

41:15.137 --> 41:17.724
...I got it!

41:18.034 --> 41:18.896
Got it?

41:18.896 --> 41:19.896
Victory!

41:20.758 --> 41:22.241
Oh,
that's so cold too.

41:23.724 --> 41:24.724
Oh, that's cold.

41:34.103 --> 41:35.137
How are
you doing, Scott?

41:36.068 --> 41:38.724
And I'm almost
six feet down.

41:38.724 --> 41:42.241
<i>After three hours,
hauling out heavy rocks,</i>

41:42.241 --> 41:45.137
<i>Scott is finally adding depth
to the dive hole</i>

41:45.137 --> 41:48.068
<i>at Kayla's Nugget Creek site.</i>

41:48.068 --> 41:49.862
Yeah, that's not
a small rock, dude.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.827
mountain sticking up.

41:55.827 --> 41:56.689
It does, doesn't it?

42:00.965 --> 42:01.862
That's a big win.

42:04.448 --> 42:05.206
How are you doing?

42:06.275 --> 42:07.172
My [bleep] head hurts.

42:10.689 --> 42:12.827
<i>Adding a foot
to the dive hole,</i>

42:12.827 --> 42:14.241
<i>Scott's ready to call it.</i>

42:17.275 --> 42:18.551
We know
I like long dives.

42:18.551 --> 42:21.034
But I could feel
my head hurting.

42:21.034 --> 42:22.344
Still got quite
a bit done, though.

42:24.379 --> 42:26.172
I opened that hole up a lot.

42:26.172 --> 42:27.310
Yeah.

42:27.310 --> 42:29.206
That is a... That hole is...

42:29.206 --> 42:30.724
double the size
from when I went in.

42:32.896 --> 42:35.000
I understand the reasoning
for Scott getting out.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.137
I don't want anyone
in the water if they
don't feel good.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.620
He still got a lot
done, though.

42:39.448 --> 42:40.448
I'm gonna check the box,

42:40.448 --> 42:41.689
see if we got
anything in there.

42:43.655 --> 42:45.068
I don't see anything big, yet.

42:45.068 --> 42:45.931
A lot of pyrite.

42:46.896 --> 42:48.655
There's a lot
of pyrite.

42:48.655 --> 42:49.793
Tons of pyrite.

42:51.379 --> 42:52.758
No nuggets, yet.

42:52.758 --> 42:54.068
Yeah, we're probably
not gonna see those

42:54.068 --> 42:56.448
until we get about a foot
off the bedrock.

42:56.448 --> 42:58.137
I know everybody wants
seven feet deep,

42:58.137 --> 43:00.137
but we take it 12 to 15,

43:00.137 --> 43:02.206
then we hit it at seven,
we'll be excited.

43:02.206 --> 43:04.379
The older reports
that I read said,

43:04.379 --> 43:06.482
average 12 to 20.

43:06.482 --> 43:08.206
I'm okay with 12 feet, though.

43:08.206 --> 43:11.068
Looking at it, I just don't
think it's gonna be 20.

43:11.068 --> 43:12.206
I don't think
so either.

43:12.206 --> 43:14.448
It's the way the walls
are coming down in the canyon.

43:14.448 --> 43:15.586
The 12 feet, we got it.

43:16.275 --> 43:17.724
Yeah.

43:17.724 --> 43:18.965
Seven feet is gonna
be even better.

43:20.241 --> 43:22.620
We didn't see
any gold, but...

43:22.620 --> 43:24.724
we got that much closer
to getting to bedrock.

43:24.724 --> 43:26.758
So hopefully, we're that much
closer to getting gold.

43:37.551 --> 43:39.517
<i>Down at
the Golden Gate site,</i>

43:39.517 --> 43:42.137
<i>Carlos is five hours
into his dive.</i>

43:43.620 --> 43:45.241
How you doing
down there, buddy?

43:45.241 --> 43:46.655
Not going good, man.

43:46.655 --> 43:47.862
I'm getting deeper.

43:48.448 --> 43:50.137
Moving some rocks.

43:51.413 --> 43:53.586
<i>After removing
the overhanging section</i>

43:53.586 --> 43:55.689
<i>of the asteroid boulder,</i>

43:55.689 --> 43:57.862
<i>Carlos is now deepening
the dive hole.</i>

43:59.793 --> 44:01.551
Do you want the choker
or the basket?

44:01.551 --> 44:03.172
Basket.
Absolutely basket.

44:06.172 --> 44:07.103
He's getting pretty deep.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.793
I don't know how deep
he's getting, but...

44:08.793 --> 44:10.620
he's been moving quite a few
boulders out of the way.

44:17.896 --> 44:21.241
Oh, [bleep]!

44:25.034 --> 44:26.137
You let it get to you?

44:26.137 --> 44:28.034
Yeah, it got me good.

44:28.862 --> 44:30.206
You have no idea, man.

44:30.206 --> 44:31.689
Bit my fingers bad, man.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.862
The end of that suction,

44:35.862 --> 44:38.379
will grab your hand
and it's a six-inch tube

44:39.655 --> 44:42.310
and it'll bend all your damn
fingers back

44:42.310 --> 44:43.896
and try to break
your hand off.

44:45.551 --> 44:48.000
This is not
a friendly place for
dredging, you know?

44:48.827 --> 44:50.379
This is a constant battle.

44:52.172 --> 44:55.965
<i>At six hours,
Carlos is reaching his limit.</i>

44:57.517 --> 45:00.310
Okay, man. I might have
been a little bit zealous.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.965
I got tired...

45:05.241 --> 45:06.068
I'm calling it.

45:08.172 --> 45:11.344
Diver's coming up.

45:11.344 --> 45:15.413
I think Carlos just pulled off
the longest dive
in the season so far.

45:20.379 --> 45:21.586
What? Thank you.

45:21.586 --> 45:22.965
Damn good job, man.

45:23.827 --> 45:25.379
Ah, that was
a decent dive.

45:25.379 --> 45:27.620
I didn't get
all I wanted to do.

45:27.620 --> 45:30.448
But I was like, in the quarry,
you know?

45:30.448 --> 45:32.827
Rocks to my left,
rocks to my right.

45:33.448 --> 45:36.137
Rocks to my front.

45:36.137 --> 45:40.689
<i>Carlos' epic dive
has got the dive hole
down to eight feet.</i>

45:42.862 --> 45:43.793
See any gold?

45:45.827 --> 45:46.896
Well, it started, man.

45:48.344 --> 45:49.137
Look at that, buddy.

45:50.172 --> 45:52.448
I knew there was gold here.

45:52.448 --> 45:54.758
If our small gold
is this big or bigger,

45:54.758 --> 45:56.034
we're in for a treat.

45:56.034 --> 45:58.068
- That is not small.
- Hey,
that's gold, dude.

45:58.068 --> 45:59.551
That's gold.

45:59.551 --> 46:00.862
That
that's really exciting.

46:00.862 --> 46:03.517
So, that means like, we're on
the freaking money, man.

46:03.517 --> 46:05.034
Look,
check that out, dude.

46:05.034 --> 46:06.310
All right.

46:06.310 --> 46:09.034
That's a pretty good start.
I mean, for our first gold.

46:10.172 --> 46:11.896
I'm not gonna complain.

46:11.896 --> 46:13.482
- That's big too.
- It is.

46:14.344 --> 46:17.344
That's a good sign, man.
Seeing gold.

46:17.344 --> 46:19.517
We're gonna find gold
before we got to the bedrock,

46:21.517 --> 46:25.068
we know that we're gonna
get gold now for sure.

46:25.068 --> 46:29.620
<i>After seven weeks
of back-breaking work
at Nugget Creek,</i>

46:29.620 --> 46:34.241
<i>Dustin and his crew
have finally dredged
their first gold.</i>

46:34.241 --> 46:37.517
I'm so excited that we didn't
have to get to bedrock

46:37.517 --> 46:38.689
to find gold.

46:39.689 --> 46:41.896
We found gold
at eight feet deep.

46:42.931 --> 46:44.310
I love this place.

46:44.310 --> 46:45.931
Even more than I ever thought.

46:45.931 --> 46:48.896
I hated thinking I was gonna
go bankrupt.

46:49.620 --> 46:51.137
This is gonna happen for us.

46:51.586 --> 46:52.379
Finally...

46:54.000 --> 46:56.344
We're gonna get more gold
than we ever thought.

46:56.344 --> 46:57.655
And this is gonna be amazing.

47:12.793 --> 47:15.137
<i>On the next</i>
Gold Rush: White Water...

47:15.137 --> 47:16.862
These boulders
are kicking our ass.

47:19.137 --> 47:20.689
That went up my butt!

47:20.689 --> 47:21.655
Scott, look at this.

47:21.655 --> 47:22.551
That's clay.

47:24.965 --> 47:26.137
This is gonna be
a game changer.

47:27.241 --> 47:29.793
What I'm talking about.
Go, go, go!

47:29.793 --> 47:31.551
I saw a couple
of little flakes.

47:31.551 --> 47:32.620
That's awesome.

47:32.620 --> 47:33.827
A storm,
coming through.

47:33.827 --> 47:34.827
It is a big one.

47:37.034 --> 47:39.620
Gold is great.
Your life is more.

47:39.620 --> 47:41.586
Whenever it feels like
we're making progress,

47:41.586 --> 47:43.068
something sets us back.

47:45.310 --> 47:47.482
Why you so mad?
Like, I'm just trying to help.

47:47.482 --> 47:49.000
You came and took
over what I was doing.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.793
He's cracked under
too much pressure.

47:54.068 --> 47:55.586
I have a feeling,
he's calling the season.
