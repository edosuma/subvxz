WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.766 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.612
You're a warrior

00:31.448 --> 00:32.866
"It's a Pony Thing."

00:36.078 --> 00:37.913
Check this out, Pony.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.542
Hit me with a score, pal.

00:41.625 --> 00:47.172
One neigh means "Good." And two neighsmeans, "Is she a professional?"

00:48.173 --> 00:50.259
Pony? Where are you?

00:57.099 --> 01:00.310
There you are, Pony. It's almost time. There you are, Pony. It's almost time.

01:00.394 --> 01:05.983
I have prepared a fabulous habitatfor our soon-to-be lunar butterfly…

01:09.319 --> 01:11.530
whom you've aptly named Whinny.

01:12.781 --> 01:16.493
I believe she's almost readyfor her big transformation.

01:19.454 --> 01:25.210
Now, here's a perfect spot for her.Cool, shady, and away from the sun.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.304
Aha! Found ya.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.225
Pinecone. What an electric entrance.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.102
Hey, Greymoon. Hey, Pony.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.731
I've been looking all over for ya.What have you been up to, pal?

01:45.814 --> 01:50.319
Well, you'll be excited to learnthat Whinny here is hatching today.

01:50.903 --> 01:54.364
And I've made Ponymy official cocoon caretaker.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.949
You did?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.952
Is that good?

01:59.036 --> 02:02.789
Well, yes. He's goingto watch over it for me all day. Well, yes. He's goingto watch over it for me all day.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.503
He is? All day? A cocoon?

02:08.336 --> 02:10.881
This is no ordinary cocoon.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.511
It will hatch intothe exceptionally rare lunar butterfly.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.639
Which is said to glowas brilliantly as the moon.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.142
Now, we just need to close upthese blackout curtains

02:22.226 --> 02:25.145
to keep her habitat nice and dark, and--

02:25.229 --> 02:26.939
Oh, my stars.

02:27.022 --> 02:31.026
Glowworm holes.They always eat through my best things.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.320
But I must admitthey do have excellent taste.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.367
Well, I'm going to haveto buy new curtains in town.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.828
Pony, you'll stay here and keep watch,won't you?

02:44.414 --> 02:45.541
Thank you.

02:45.624 --> 02:49.878
And remember, lunar butterfliesare nighttime animals and prefer the dark.

02:50.504 --> 02:56.218
If the metamorphosis transpires while I'mgone, try to keep her well-shaded.

02:57.469 --> 03:01.723
I bid you good day. I bid you good day.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.898
I always ruin my dramatic exit spellby forgetting my hat. Good day.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.692
Don't worry, pal.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.527
I'll find a way to get you out of this.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.321
I can't leave you to watcha boring old cocoon,

03:16.405 --> 03:18.448
when I knowthe last thing you'd want to do

03:18.532 --> 03:22.411
is miss out on all the cool stuffI have planned for us. Am I right?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.622
Am I right?

03:25.706 --> 03:28.584
Am I right?

03:30.794 --> 03:33.714
Do I know my best friend or what?

03:33.797 --> 03:36.091
We've got one-armed push-ups to practice,

03:36.175 --> 03:39.386
and we can finally explorethat cave down by the swamp.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.974
It looks super dark, and I think a ghoulmight live in it. Isn't that awesome?

03:46.768 --> 03:49.021
You don't wanna let Greymoon down, do you?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.400
Well, you won't have to,

03:53.483 --> 03:56.778
'cause I'm gonna find youthe perfect replacement cocoon sitter.

03:56.862 --> 04:00.032
I wonder why Greymoon would thinkyou'd want this job anyway. I wonder why Greymoon would thinkyou'd want this job anyway.

04:06.038 --> 04:10.125
Hey, Pony. Check out this frog.

04:10.209 --> 04:14.796
His non-blinking eyes say,"I won't let you out of my sight."

04:30.562 --> 04:32.022
Right.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.066
Frogs eat bugs.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.151
We'll find a different sitter.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.402
Okay.

04:37.486 --> 04:42.616
Who would make a better cocoonbabysitter than another cocoon?

04:48.455 --> 04:51.917
So, maybethe whole babysitter thing isn't working.

04:52.876 --> 04:57.673
But don't give up yet, 'cause I've gotone last idea, and it's genius.

05:00.551 --> 05:05.347
I've come up with a solutionto solve all of our problem.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.018
A cocoon alarm.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.813
Now you can watch the cocoonwithout watching it.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.525
If it starts to hatch, the branchwill shake, and the alarm will sound.

05:17.442 --> 05:22.155
This is what we in the problem-solving bizlike to call a real win-win.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.617
Or in this case, a really whinny-whinny.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.126
Don't worry. I know Whinny needs shade.I thought of that too.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.255
There.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.549
You are doing everything Greymoon asked,

05:40.632 --> 05:42.968
so there's no reasonwe can't go have fun together.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.846
Isn't that great?

05:49.099 --> 05:51.852
I was starting to thinkI was gonna let you down.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.937
And then what kind of friend would I be?

05:57.274 --> 06:00.903
Eighteen… 19… 20. Eighteen… 19… 20.

06:00.986 --> 06:05.115
Check this out, Pony. I'm getting so huge.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.327
You don't have to stare at the bell, pal.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.829
It'll ringwhen the cocoon starts to hatch.

06:10.913 --> 06:14.583
Twenty-one. Twenty-two.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.092
Seventy-three.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.803
Seventy-four.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.643
Seventy-four.Exactly how many I meant to do.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.436
Did you see that, Pony?

06:35.437 --> 06:40.609
Pony, how come you're so worried?The alarm is super secure.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.818
See?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.489
Seems a bit loose.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.034
Uh-oh.

06:49.618 --> 06:54.289
Don't panic, but I think my foolproofalarm might have been fooled a bit.

06:59.378 --> 07:02.130
Oh, no. We missed it. Oh, no. We missed it.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.341
Sorry, pal.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.719
At least you don't have towatch it anymore, right?

07:12.850 --> 07:15.269
Did you just snap a twig?

07:17.020 --> 07:19.982
Are you upset with me?

07:22.401 --> 07:25.654
But I didn't thinkyou wanted to watch the cocoon.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.283
I thought you wanted to hang with me.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.830
Hello, habitat!

07:39.793 --> 07:42.629
A perfect entrance wasted.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.132
We missed the hatching.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.384
And it's all my fault.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.596
Oh, my. That is disappointing.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.431
Especially for Pony,

07:52.514 --> 07:56.602
who spent so much time visiting Whinnywhen she was a caterpillar.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.478
He did?

07:58.562 --> 08:00.772
On all your morning walks. On all your morning walks.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.650
Pony, check this out.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.072
Pony. Pony. Check this out, Pony.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.203
Check this out, Pony.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.414
We usually do everything together.

08:18.290 --> 08:24.379
But all that time you had your own thing,and I didn't even notice.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.465
I'm sorry, pal.

08:26.548 --> 08:30.052
I think we'd better find Whinny andget her back to the dark of her habitat.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.847
Too much sunlight makes lunar butterfliesfeel weak and disoriented.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.683
But how will we find her?

08:36.767 --> 08:38.268
She could be anywhere.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.073
He's got something.

09:09.258 --> 09:13.303
Wrong smell, huh?I know how much you care about her, pal.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.851
Just think. Where would Whinny like to go?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.813
I'm sorry, Pony.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.816
I can't believeI was trying to get you to do push-ups

09:25.899 --> 09:28.402
and go explore the dark cavewhen you really want--

09:31.864 --> 09:34.491
Yes! I knew you'd figure it out.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.076
Where are we going?

09:40.706 --> 09:43.584
The dark cave. And Whinny loves the dark.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.794
Pony, you're a genius.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.553
Maybe we should go lookin other dark places?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.704
Wow. She's amazing, Pony.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.256
I can see why you were so interestedin getting to know her.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.805
You're right, pal.We better get her out of the sun.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.059
Let's take you home.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.146
You found her.

10:46.230 --> 10:50.400
Pinecone, care to stayand watch Whinny with us?

10:50.484 --> 10:53.820
It's supposed to cloud over later,so she might be able to come out to play.

10:54.446 --> 10:58.242
Thanks, but I thinkI'll let Pony stay and do his thing.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.746
It's okay if we don'tdo everything together. It's okay if we don'tdo everything together.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.583
A sign of a solid friendship.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.127
Hey, Pony. What do you say

11:09.211 --> 11:12.130
we split up for the rest of the afternoonto do our own things

11:12.214 --> 11:14.633
and meet up laterto do some together things?

11:15.801 --> 11:19.471
Great. I'm off to practicemy vaulting some more.

11:19.555 --> 11:20.556
Check you later.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.520
Is she a professional?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.987
"Hawthorn the Adventurer."

11:40.158 --> 11:43.620
I can't believeyou're going on your very first quest.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.123
Aren't you so excited?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.333
Like, so, so, so excited?

11:49.751 --> 11:51.253
Yeah, sure.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.798
All Wiz Kids have to completethis quest at some point.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.925
It's been that way for generations.

11:57.509 --> 12:01.430
Is it true that when you get to the end,you have to sign a huge rock? Is it true that when you get to the end,you have to sign a huge rock?

12:02.014 --> 12:03.932
Yep. One-eyed Rock.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.685
Why is it called that?

12:06.768 --> 12:08.020
Maybe the shape.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.233
All I know is I have to make it therebefore sundown for the quest to count.

12:13.317 --> 12:20.115
And I really need it to count, becauseI'm the last one in my class to do it.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.747
Good idea, Blaise.An extra cloak couldn't hurt.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.752
Greymoon said this quest was all aboutproving one's resourcefulness.

12:32.252 --> 12:36.131
So I did a ton of researchon questing, the Fearsome Forest,

12:36.215 --> 12:38.717
and questing in the Fearsome Forest.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.303
I wanna be prepared for anything.

12:41.386 --> 12:45.557
That's great and all, Hawth.But questing isn't about what's in there.

12:45.641 --> 12:50.729
It's about what's in here and here.And here and here.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.398
I'm confused.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.068
Real adventurers follow their instincts.

12:57.361 --> 13:00.072
They act fast. They run faster. They act fast. They run faster.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.742
Adventurers are brave and strong.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.246
I meant to pack that one.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.625
Look, I get what you're saying,but I really think--

13:11.708 --> 13:16.338
Don't think. Feel.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.091
I'm not much of a feeler.

13:19.716 --> 13:24.221
That's why I'm coming along. To show youthe ropes of being an adventurer.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.933
Thanks, Pinecone. I appreciate it.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.060
No problemo.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.480
I've beenon tons of quests with my parents.

13:33.564 --> 13:36.400
-One time, my mom and I…-Okay, let's see.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.610
Clothing for all types of weather. Check.

13:38.694 --> 13:43.282
Map. Check. Rope. Check.Binoculars. Check.

13:43.365 --> 13:46.201
Tiny binoculars for Blaise. Check.

13:47.244 --> 13:52.541
Oops. I almost forgot.A tuna sandwich in case we get hungry.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.671
So, you ready for some questing?

13:58.463 --> 14:04.011
Maybe I should pack a few more booksor an extra umbrella or-- Maybe I should pack a few more booksor an extra umbrella or--

14:04.094 --> 14:08.307
You're gonna be fine, Hawth.You're a born adventurer. Like me.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.604
Besides, so many Wiz Kidshave done this quest before you,

14:14.188 --> 14:17.024
and most of themmade it back in one piece.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.525
You go on ahead.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.657
Just in case.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.287
Come on, Hawth. Put the map away.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.956
We can follow our instincts.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.416
I don't know.

14:34.499 --> 14:38.754
Our instincts won't know ifsomething unexpected is going to happen.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.507
That's what makes it so unexpected.

14:41.590 --> 14:47.095
Let adventure be your guide.Go where the spirits takes you.

14:47.179 --> 14:50.098
-Leap before you---Look out!

14:53.018 --> 14:55.020
Didn't see that there.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.689
I did. It was on the map.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.650
Right.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.819
So, what do you think?Should we climb down?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.823
There must be another way.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.952
Maybe I could build a rope bridge?

15:10.035 --> 15:11.745
Or…

15:11.828 --> 15:15.499
we could swing over it!

15:17.918 --> 15:19.628
What?

15:19.711 --> 15:20.879
Yeah!

15:23.715 --> 15:25.509
You could have been hurt.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.886
Is this what adventurers do?

15:29.012 --> 15:30.347
Your turn.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.646
We can find another route.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.524
Come on. Don't be scared, Hawth.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.861
I'm not scared. I'm being careful.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.573
Ticktock. Time's a-wasting, Hawth.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.033
If you don't finish this quest by sundown,

15:50.117 --> 15:53.829
you'll still be the only Wiz Kidwho hasn't done it.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.831
Okay, okay.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.876
Maybe I do need to be more adventurous.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.224
See? I knew ya could do it.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.727
I guess my advice really rubbed off on ya.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.771
That's-- That's great.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.481
Right, Pony?

16:22.608 --> 16:26.486
Yeah. I feel full of adventurous spirit.

16:31.617 --> 16:34.953
Now let's get questing!

16:36.413 --> 16:37.956
Yeah.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.546
Huh?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.257
Hey.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.191
Yeah!

17:15.827 --> 17:16.869
Hey!

17:23.001 --> 17:24.920
We could have made it across the stream

17:25.002 --> 17:27.422
without waking up a river guardian,you know?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.260
We've got to make it to One-eyed Rockbefore sundown.

17:31.844 --> 17:35.138
Sure, but we can stillbe careful sometimes. And--

17:35.222 --> 17:38.475
Sounds like someone is missingthe adventurous spirit.

17:38.559 --> 17:43.063
Hey. I thought this quest was aboutproving your "resource-less-ness,"

17:43.146 --> 17:45.399
or whatever you said. What about that?

17:45.482 --> 17:48.610
All the great stuff you packedreally came in handy today, Hawth.

17:48.694 --> 17:51.613
Real adventurers don't need stuff.

17:51.697 --> 17:57.119
They need instinct,speed, bravery, and strength.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.625
Oh, yeah!

18:05.544 --> 18:08.797
What's-- What's wrong with you?

18:08.881 --> 18:12.176
I'm just in quest mode.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.806
There's something upwith that sweatband, isn't there?

18:18.432 --> 18:22.519
No, no. Just a little somethingI picked up from Wandful Stuff

18:22.603 --> 18:25.063
to make me more adventurous.

18:25.147 --> 18:29.318
Wandful Stuff?That weird magic store in town?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.446
That place gives me the creeps.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.741
Now who sounds scared?

18:35.824 --> 18:37.826
Scared for you.

18:37.910 --> 18:41.079
I think you shouldtake that thing off. Now.

18:41.163 --> 18:44.875
Uh-uh. Don't think. Just feel.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.712
I'm serious, Hawthorn.It's making you act weird.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.172
Plus, it stinks.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.134
I need it to finish the quest.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.345
You don't! Take it off.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.804
Make me.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.856
We're okay, pal. Don't you worry.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.442
Huh? One-eyed Rock.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.322
I did it. I completed the quest.

19:16.823 --> 19:21.703
I get it. It's called One-eyed Rock'cause of the big eye on it.

19:27.626 --> 19:30.504
A big eye that opens.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.714
Hide!

19:34.091 --> 19:36.510
Hawthorn, what are you doing?

19:36.593 --> 19:40.180
I'm gonna fight the cyclops.Classic quest stuff.

19:40.264 --> 19:44.518
I don't know what you think "classic" is,but that's not it.

19:44.601 --> 19:48.313
Look, I'm sorry I made you feellike you're not adventurous enough.

19:48.397 --> 19:52.860
You are. In your own way.A way that we need right now

19:52.943 --> 19:57.865
because the Hawthorn I know would knowwhat to do when facing a giant cyclops.

20:07.666 --> 20:11.253
If Hawthorn isn't going to bethe Hawthorn, then I'll have to be.

20:11.336 --> 20:17.634
Let's see. Traveling cloak, trail mix,pixie repellent. What can I use?

20:17.718 --> 20:19.761
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.471
Oh, yeah.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.765
I'm not scared of you, cyclops.

20:24.808 --> 20:28.103
Come on, Clopsy.Let's see what you're made of.

20:37.196 --> 20:40.032
Help! Help! Let me go!

20:40.115 --> 20:43.202
Oh, no! Pinecone!

20:43.285 --> 20:46.788
Hawthorn, run! Save Pony and Blaise.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.041
Okay. What do I do? What do I do?

20:49.124 --> 20:51.001
I can't think with this thing on.

20:53.712 --> 20:54.713
That's better.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.759
Is that smell coming from me?

20:58.842 --> 20:59.968
Where's my backpack?

21:00.552 --> 21:02.554
Thanks, you two.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.391
It's not funny.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.018
Stop it.

21:08.685 --> 21:11.772
Where is it? Where is it?

21:12.856 --> 21:15.275
Tuna on rye!

21:15.776 --> 21:19.488
You're taking a lunch break now?

21:19.571 --> 21:22.574
I'm not, but he is.

21:31.583 --> 21:36.255
All cyclopes love tuna. It's involume four of my En-cyclops-pedia.

21:37.798 --> 21:42.469
Oh, Hawth. I'm so glad you're back.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.227
You did it, Hawthorn.And just before sundown.

21:50.811 --> 21:51.979
How do you feel?

21:52.062 --> 21:54.815
Tired and thirsty.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.526
And stinky.

21:58.402 --> 22:01.655
But I thinkthat's mostly the sweatband's fault. But I thinkthat's mostly the sweatband's fault.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.700
Next quest, maybe leave it at home?

22:04.783 --> 22:07.411
I like your adventuring style as is.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.123
I like yours too. We make a good team.

22:11.206 --> 22:14.168
So, you ready for the journey home?

22:14.668 --> 22:16.086
You know it.

22:16.670 --> 22:20.549
But you wouldn't happen to haveany more of those sandwiches, would ya?

22:22.467 --> 22:25.262
Turkey, tuna, or egg salad.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.890
How you like me now?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.267
Don't go changing, pal.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
Thick as thieves

22:50.787 --> 22:55.209
Thick as thieves
