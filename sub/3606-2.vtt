00:00.501 --> 00:03.102
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> supergirl...

00:03.104 --> 00:04.903
Kara: <i> I feel like I'm not</i>
<i> living up to my potential.</i>

00:05.439 --> 00:07.406
<i> I went to work for cat Grant</i>

00:07.408 --> 00:09.842
because I thought,
that would be the way that
i could make a difference.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.778
<i> But, instead,</i>
<i> I just fetch the coffee.</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:14.513
(Sirens wailing)

00:14.515 --> 00:16.181
Reporter:
<i> While the national city</i>
<i> airlines is circling the city</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:18.450
<i> -after an engine failure.</i>
-(Exclaims)

00:18.452 --> 00:21.487
<i> Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.</i>
<i> We're going down.</i>

00:25.326 --> 00:26.592
Why do you do this to me?

00:26.594 --> 00:28.460
Because I'm your sister
and you love me.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.095
You exposed yourself.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.363
<i> To the world.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:32.731
Kara:
<i> Ever since I was adopted,</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:34.867
I felt the need
to help people,

00:34.869 --> 00:36.869
and tonight I got that chance.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.774
Hank: <i> Welcome to the deo,</i>

00:41.776 --> 00:44.610
<i> we protect earth from</i>
<i> extraterrestrial invasion.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:46.512
I'm still learning.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.348
But the people of this city
will die.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.649
You have to let me stop it.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.785
Do you have eyes
on the target?

00:52.787 --> 00:53.852
I got him.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.689
Kara: <i> I can't do it!</i>

00:57.691 --> 00:58.957
She's not strong enough.

00:58.959 --> 00:59.992
(Grunts)

00:59.994 --> 01:01.727
Kara, it's why
you were sent here.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.862
<i> I believe that,</i>
<i> you have to believe it too.</i>

01:06.634 --> 01:09.168
Kara: <i> Earth doesn't have</i>
<i> just one hero anymore.</i>

01:09.170 --> 01:10.969
<i> Now it has supergirl.</i>

01:13.941 --> 01:15.707
Kara: <i> When people see</i>
<i> that red cape,</i>

01:15.709 --> 01:18.110
<i> they expect to see</i>
<i> a certain someone.</i>

01:18.112 --> 01:19.478
<i> Someone they know.</i>

01:19.480 --> 01:21.713
<i> But this isn't his story.</i>

01:22.383 --> 01:24.049
<i> It's mine.</i>

01:24.051 --> 01:26.351
<i> It's been a week</i>
<i> since I revealed myself</i>
<i> to national city.</i>

01:26.353 --> 01:28.554
<i> So far, things are going</i>
<i> pretty well.</i>

01:28.556 --> 01:31.123
<i> I think I might actually</i>
<i> have a handle on this.</i>

01:34.061 --> 01:35.928
Is that the fastest
you can go?

01:35.930 --> 01:38.130
Are these tests
mandatory for everyone

01:38.132 --> 01:39.598
or just because I'm a...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.567
It is not because
you're a woman, miss danvers.

01:41.569 --> 01:45.137
The deo requires
rigorous physical
and psychological evaluation

01:45.139 --> 01:47.272
for all its prospective
field operatives.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.007
I was gonna say "alien."

01:49.009 --> 01:51.577
A novice superhero
could be a liability
in a field.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.513
I need to know
you're in full control
of your powers.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.082
Stamina, strength, speed.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.421
(Glass shattering)

02:02.423 --> 02:04.990
My sister just broke
the sound barrier, sir.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.091
Hank: Fire again.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.672
So, did I pass?

02:20.674 --> 02:24.710
I see you share your cousin's
appetite for wanton
destruction, miss danvers.

02:24.712 --> 02:28.580
You know, I am starting
to answer to supergirl.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.617
It's cool,
we'll... we'll find our thing.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.754
Is all of this
really necessary?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.723
I'm ready, Alex,
for all of it.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.191
I can do this.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.460
Believe it or not,
he's just looking out for you.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.362
You know, we both are.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.532
I had a full year of training
before he even let me
in the field.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.567
(Sighs) But I'm really glad
that you're here, though.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.235
(Chuckles)

02:50.237 --> 02:52.271
I hated keeping this
whole part of my life
from you.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.139
And growing up,
i always thought
you were such a bad liar.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.141
That's what a good liar
makes you think.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.277
Winn: (Over earpiece)
<i> Supergirl. Come in, supergirl.</i>

02:58.279 --> 03:00.345
Winn, what is it?
I'm kind of busy right now.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.382
Kara, there is
a huge fire raging down
at the national city port.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.516
It is bad.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.451
All right. I'm on my way.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.720
Fire at the port. Gotta go.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.422
Hey, you've been
dodging missiles

03:10.424 --> 03:13.592
and pushing your endurance
for the last two hours.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.960
Even you have your limits.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.796
For the last twelve years
i hid who I was.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.364
I don't have to anymore.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.801
And I don't want to waste
a minute of it.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.338
Besides, this sounds
like a job for supergirl.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.711
(Sirens blaring)

03:32.713 --> 03:34.112
(Explosions)

03:42.156 --> 03:43.522
What can I do, chief?

03:43.524 --> 03:46.925
That ship's holding
almost a million barrels
of crude oil.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.127
If the fire reaches it,
it's gonna go off
like a two ton bomb.

03:49.129 --> 03:52.331
And the tugboat
won't get here in time.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.632
What are you waiting for?

03:53.634 --> 03:54.933
Superman would've
blown it out by now.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.269
Right. Okay.
Uh, you've got this.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.976
(Men screaming)

04:05.045 --> 04:06.812
Man: You're making it worse.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.315
I'm going to try to move it.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.327
(Screaming)

04:33.774 --> 04:35.140
(Screaming)

04:56.063 --> 04:57.796
Newscaster:
<i> Miracle or menace?</i>

04:57.798 --> 05:00.399
<i> That's what the citizens</i>
<i> of national city</i>
<i> are asking themselves</i>

05:00.401 --> 05:03.068
<i> after the latest attempt</i>
<i> at heroics by supergirl</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:06.004
<i> left the bay facing</i>
<i> an ecological disaster.</i>

05:06.006 --> 05:07.739
(Elevator bell dings)

05:10.344 --> 05:12.177
Oh, god, is that smell you?

05:12.179 --> 05:16.415
Three showers and I still reek
of burning oil.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.751
I went from superhero
to ecoterrorist
in a single bound.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.321
Hey, hey.
You're just, like, a week
into this superhero thing,

05:22.323 --> 05:24.356
you're going to make
some mistakes. (Chuckles)

05:24.358 --> 05:26.358
Like, when you
first started working here

05:26.360 --> 05:28.794
and cat asked you
to get her lunch
and you went to chipotle.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.630
Yeah, except now
I'm making mistakes
in front of the whole world.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.066
Maxwell lord: (On TV)
<i> Forget about supergirl's</i>
<i> lack of experience,</i>

05:34.068 --> 05:37.369
<i> I'm talking about the trouble</i>
<i> she'll bring to national city.</i>

05:37.371 --> 05:39.671
<i> Look at Metropolis.</i>

05:39.673 --> 05:44.242
<i> Since superman's arrival,</i>
<i> a veritable super bad guy war</i>
<i> has been waged on that city.</i>

05:44.244 --> 05:47.546
<i> Their maintenance budgets</i>
<i> have quadrupled.</i>

05:47.548 --> 05:51.249
<i> National city does not need</i>
<i> Metropolis' problems.</i>

05:51.251 --> 05:53.452
-Who cares what that guy says?
-You do.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.620
Isn't Maxwell lord
your personal hero?

05:55.622 --> 05:59.191
-I own a couple Maxwell lord
watches and his biography.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.460
-And his autobiography...
-Yeah.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.563
Cat: <i> Drunk, 9:00 A.M.</i>

06:04.565 --> 06:06.365
<i> That's the last time</i>
<i> I have breakfast with</i>
<i> Ruth bader ginsburg.</i>

06:06.367 --> 06:08.266
-(Elevator bell dings)
-She's here.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.302
At least now I know
how you do that.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.539
(Sighs)

06:14.541 --> 06:16.341
Here is your latte, Ms. Grant.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.612
-It's hot.
-Just how you like it.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.948
A concern you didn't seem
to share before today.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.450
Content meeting, two minutes,
my office.

06:28.222 --> 06:32.023
We're all aware of supergirl's
latest debacle, yes?

06:32.025 --> 06:35.761
She made sure
no one will surf national city
for the next 10,000 years.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.429
Some hero.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.631
Cat: It was the lead story
on the <i> daily planet</i> homepage,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.666
their fifth in as many days.

06:41.668 --> 06:45.270
Which annoys me
because the <i> daily planet</i>
already has a go-to superhero,

06:45.272 --> 06:49.608
and now they're trying
to steal mine.

06:49.610 --> 06:53.412
Now, when I branded her,
there was an implicit promise

06:53.414 --> 06:56.448
that she would be,
at a minimum, above average.

06:56.450 --> 07:00.018
But in the past week,
she has proved
herself to be...

07:00.020 --> 07:03.555
Oh, what is the opposite
of super?

07:03.557 --> 07:06.391
#terriblegirl?

07:06.393 --> 07:09.227
You know, superman
made plenty of mistakes
when he first started.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.731
At least she's saving lives.

07:12.733 --> 07:17.102
In the sloppiest, most awkward
way imaginable, James.

07:19.506 --> 07:23.642
So it is left to us
to take control
of supergirl's narrative.

07:23.644 --> 07:27.179
Save her from self-immolation,
and scoop the <i> planet.</i>

07:27.981 --> 07:29.381
I want an interview.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.482
(Snickers)

07:33.720 --> 07:35.487
Yes, Kara?

07:35.489 --> 07:37.289
Sorry, sorry. I just...

07:37.291 --> 07:40.692
I just started to think
about this kitten video

07:40.694 --> 07:43.094
I saw online earlier.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.031
It's so funny what they
make those cats do.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.966
I'll send it to all of you.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.168
Or not.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.504
James...

07:52.506 --> 07:57.843
Perhaps your friend in blue
would be useful
in arranging a sit down?

07:57.845 --> 08:01.680
Maybe you could
broach the subject,
the next time you "bro hang."

08:01.682 --> 08:06.418
(Chuckles)
It, uh, doesn't really work
that way, Ms. Grant.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.853
Mmm.

08:07.855 --> 08:12.057
Well, let me assure all of
you, Lois Lane, Clark Kent,

08:12.059 --> 08:13.725
and all of the hags
over at the <i> daily planet</i>

08:13.727 --> 08:16.127
are working day and night
to get this exclusive.

08:16.129 --> 08:19.331
We need to get it first.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.834
I want a sit down
with supergirl.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.202
A girl to girl.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.638
And I want it by, um,
the end of the week.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.608
Go, go.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.942
Go, go.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.578
Not you, Kara.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.417
Do you really think
that I don't know
what's going on with you?

08:39.419 --> 08:40.519
You do?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.521
Well, no.
And honestly, I don't care.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.756
But whatever it is,
it's affecting you
at the office.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.825
Now you need to join a gym,

08:46.827 --> 08:48.827
uh, see a shrink, whatever,

08:48.829 --> 08:50.195
but get your head
out of the clouds

08:50.197 --> 08:53.598
and back behind the desk
where it belongs.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.066
(Sighs) All right.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.239
Kara: I am not doing
that interview. No.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.542
I can't... I mean, I can't.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.311
Ms. Grant's not stupid.
She'd recognize me in,
like, one second.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.814
She will look at supergirl
right in the face and she will
not even see her assistant.

09:09.816 --> 09:10.982
How can you be so sure?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.450
Because she doesn't see
you now.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.519
I watched it happen
for years with your cousin.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.521
Why don't you think
that people recognize him
as Clark Kent?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.623
Reading glasses
and a good slouch?

09:18.625 --> 09:20.659
No, he's able to hide

09:20.661 --> 09:23.295
because the world can't
believe that there's really
a hero in their midst.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.096
Yeah, and I'm sure
there's a good reason

09:25.098 --> 09:27.365
why my cousin keeps his job
at <i> the daily planet</i>

09:27.367 --> 09:29.768
instead of flying around
as superman all the time,

09:29.770 --> 09:32.270
which would be so much easier.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.640
Yeah well, one,
he's able to pay his rent.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.009
She's going to keep
pressuring you
about that interview.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.678
Oh, I can handle cat Grant.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.247
I don't know...

09:42.916 --> 09:44.382
I don't know. I... I...

09:44.384 --> 09:47.018
Maybe I put the "s" on
too soon.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.556
Kara, look out the window.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.394
Tell me what you see.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.831
Buildings. Billboards.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.133
There's that bar
where that guy cards me
all the time.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.969
He knows how old I am.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.039
I see a city full of people
who need help.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.309
Who need a hero.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.178
(Sighs)

10:13.914 --> 10:15.513
You really think so?

10:16.717 --> 10:19.484
If anyone can fill
superman's boots...

10:20.387 --> 10:21.486
It's you.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.057
Thank you, James.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.095
That was a really good
pep talk.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.896
Excellent use of pep.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.431
Brilliant. Awesome.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.873
Guard 1:
Look, superman's the man.
I Grant you that.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.377
All I'm saying is, I think
it's great national city's
got our own superhero.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.212
Guard 2: Yeah,
you said the same thing

10:47.214 --> 10:49.481
when we got our own
professional basketball team.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.416
You saw how well
that turned out.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.684
(Clanging)

10:55.255 --> 10:57.689
Hey, everything okay up here?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.662
Yeah,
just finishing things up.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.763
Let me see your ID.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.533
Stand back from the tank.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.036
We have a security breach
in sector 52.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.474
(Hissing)

11:17.878 --> 11:19.244
(Screaming)

11:26.987 --> 11:28.286
(Screaming)

11:41.134 --> 11:42.567
Hank: What is she doing here?

11:42.569 --> 11:46.304
I called her, sir.
We hunt aliens. She is one.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.573
It's a resource
we didn't have before.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.443
-What can I do to help?
-Don't cause any oil spills.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.411
Take a look around.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.280
Don't touch anything.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.950
Alex, this whole facility
specializes in
chemical manufacturing.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.152
Sodium hypochlorite,
ammonium nitrate.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.520
Ingredients for
a chemical bomb?

12:02.522 --> 12:04.823
Yeah. We need to find
this alien, fast.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.403
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

12:19.339 --> 12:20.905
I wanted to see you.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.241
I'm sorry I could not
be home sooner.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.243
Father made dinner.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.312
-Then I am truly sorry.
-(Chuckles)

12:27.314 --> 12:28.713
Zor-El has many
fine qualities.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.915
Sadly, cooking is
not among them.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.586
Why were you working so late?

12:34.588 --> 12:37.355
Oh, another criminal
was brought to the citadel.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.023
What kind?

12:39.025 --> 12:40.825
He is not from Krypton.

12:40.827 --> 12:43.061
His people are
called hellgrammites.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.329
And you stopped him?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.364
Oh, the military guild
arrested him.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.868
It is my job as adjudicator
to get justice
for his victims,

12:49.870 --> 12:52.804
and make sure he never hurts
anyone ever again.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.340
I want to help people
just like you some day.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.576
-You will, Kara.
-How do you know?

12:58.578 --> 13:02.013
Because you have the heart
of a hero.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.985
-Now get some sleep.
-Okay.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.459
Hellgrammite.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.434
You're looking
for a hellgrammite.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.770
That stinger you pulled out,
I've seen it before
on Krypton.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.939
My mother sent one of
their kind to fort rozz.

13:27.941 --> 13:31.242
According to the data
we salvaged from the wreckage
of fort rozz,

13:31.244 --> 13:32.610
there was
a hellgrammite prisoner.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.279
What do we know about
his species?

13:34.281 --> 13:35.880
Not much.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.751
It's basically a large insect,

13:39.753 --> 13:42.153
but he can camouflage himself
into any shape he wants.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.822
Humanoid included.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.758
A giant insect trying to steal
bomb-grade chemical compounds.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.827
This job never ceases
to surprise.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.530
You guys track him down,
and I'll take him out,
just like we did with vartox.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.299
Sure thing, miss danvers.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.435
If you can prove to us
you can handle yourself
without getting killed.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.473
What are we doing in here?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.075
When I joined the deo,

14:04.077 --> 14:07.212
I spent 12 hours a day
for five straight months
in this room.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.081
We need to know that
you're prepared for everything
you might face out there.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.417
Alex, I can bend steel
with my bare hands.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.919
And last week,
i kicked vartox's butt.

14:14.921 --> 14:15.954
I'm ready enough.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.822
-You really think so?
-Yeah. I do.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.457
(Grunts)

14:20.026 --> 14:21.159
(Machine humming)

14:21.161 --> 14:22.560
(Panting)

14:23.530 --> 14:25.129
How did you do that?

14:25.131 --> 14:28.766
Kryptonite emitters.
You're only at 18%.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.535
Not enough
to permanently harm you,

14:30.537 --> 14:32.136
but enough to weaken you.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.638
Make this a fair fight.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.040
I just found out last week
that kryptonite exists.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.543
Only the deo knows
it can hurt me.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.478
You may have powers, Kara,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.547
but so do most of
the fort rozz aliens.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.716
Not only do they have
the element of surprise,

14:44.718 --> 14:48.119
but they've also had time
to master their abilities.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.921
We may not always know
who our enemies are,

14:49.923 --> 14:52.724
so we need to be prepared
to face anyone.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.760
Now, come at me.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.596
(Grunting)

15:01.067 --> 15:02.567
(Panting)

15:07.474 --> 15:09.440
(Both grunting)

15:10.277 --> 15:11.743
(Groans)

15:11.745 --> 15:14.445
Your wind up leaves you open
for a counterattack.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.015
(Both panting)

15:18.051 --> 15:19.217
(Sighs)

15:19.219 --> 15:20.485
(Grunting)

15:21.354 --> 15:23.087
(Groans)

15:23.089 --> 15:26.858
You're relying on your
strength without technique.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.960
When you are facing
a superior opponent,

15:28.962 --> 15:31.262
you need to use their strength
against them.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.563
(Grunting)

15:37.904 --> 15:41.039
All right, all right, enough.
You made your point.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.779
Well, maybe I'm not
deo material after all.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.882
I think I know why my cousin
prefers to work alone.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.183
Miss danvers...

15:53.186 --> 15:55.186
I hate that you
made me do that.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.821
You should be thanking me.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.457
You may have just saved
your sister's life.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.025
(Sighs)

16:11.938 --> 16:13.671
Why are you walking like that?

16:13.673 --> 16:16.140
I took your advice to get
my head out of the clouds,

16:16.142 --> 16:18.943
so I took a kickboxing class.
I'm a little sore.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.114
"Supergirl failure to launch?"

16:23.116 --> 16:25.516
I don't need you to read it
to me. I wrote it.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.418
Get it to copy
for the noon posting.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.320
I don't get it.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.523
Why do you keep
criticizing supergirl
for trying to save the city?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.159
When superman started...

16:35.161 --> 16:36.828
He, he, he. Him, him, him.

16:36.830 --> 16:40.398
I am so sick of hearing
about the man of steel.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.502
Every woman worth her salt
knows that we have to work
twice as hard as a man

16:44.504 --> 16:46.404
to be thought of
as half as good.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.840
Well, she did rescue
that plane.

16:48.842 --> 16:52.010
Yes, which she ditched,
bobbing in a bay.

16:52.012 --> 16:55.913
Engineers are working around
the clock trying to remove it.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.516
She saved that tanker
from exploding.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.286
Causing an oil slick,
which they're still trying
to clean up.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.922
Now, I don't like the fishes,

17:04.924 --> 17:09.627
but it does reassure me
to know that they're still
under there swimming about.

17:09.629 --> 17:13.364
Well, if supergirl were here,

17:13.366 --> 17:17.468
what would you suggest she do?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.203
Calm the hell down.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.839
She's taking on
way too much, way too fast.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.741
She's trying to save the day.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.177
By screwing everything up?

17:26.179 --> 17:30.081
No, this inexperienced idiot
has barely had a run
in her tights,

17:30.083 --> 17:34.152
and yet there she is
at the epicenter of danger.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.987
What's next?

17:35.989 --> 17:37.889
"I think I'll catch the meteor
that's headed straight
for the white house?"

17:37.891 --> 17:39.190
Oh!

17:39.192 --> 17:41.225
Whoopsy.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.428
No, no, no.
There is a learning curve.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.998
You don't just walk
through the front door
and suddenly own the company.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.101
I started out as
Perry white's assistant.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.036
I worked my ass off

17:52.038 --> 17:55.606
until one day I finally had
the chance to write an article
for the gossip column.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.776
Every step of the way,
i had to fight,

17:58.778 --> 18:01.879
to work hard, to get better,
to come out ahead.

18:01.881 --> 18:06.617
No, catching planes
and boats on fire, hmm...

18:06.619 --> 18:10.922
How about we start small
and work our way up?

18:10.924 --> 18:13.925
Supergirl should take
a page out of your book, Kara.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.598
Uh, this fish isn't local,
is it?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.601
No, of course not.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.106
Meet me in the alley
in five minutes.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.342
Thank god you didn't say
the roof.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.682
Hey, what's up?

18:37.684 --> 18:39.117
-Nothing, nothing.
-(Clears throat)

18:39.119 --> 18:42.854
I... I like to come out here
to smoke.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.056
Which I like to do in private.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.325
Actually, I'm meeting someone
right now so...

18:47.327 --> 18:50.228
Yeah, you can meet them
inside the building. Yeah?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.330
No, uh, my friend
likes to make an entrance.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.764
(Loud whooshing)

18:57.871 --> 18:59.270
-He knows.
-He knows?

18:59.272 --> 19:00.438
You told him?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.240
James already knew.
And winn's my friend.

19:03.676 --> 19:04.976
Yeah.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.911
If I'm going to be a hero,

19:06.913 --> 19:09.780
and prove to everyone
that I know what I'm doing,

19:09.782 --> 19:12.250
I'm gonna need to practice.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.685
Start small, get better.

19:15.889 --> 19:19.590
And to do that,
I'm gonna need your help.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.625
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.760
I... I... I said it first.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.128
(Clears throat)

19:48.955 --> 19:50.354
I don't want any trouble.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.557
Then you should've
stayed hidden,

19:52.559 --> 19:54.992
under your rock
with the rest of the insects.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.028
I have to eat.

19:57.030 --> 20:00.364
General astra promised
she would take care of all
your needs on this world.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.301
Her only request
was your loyalty.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.603
Tell her
i prefer to go it alone.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.773
Tell her yourself.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.248
I don't wanna be a part of
whatever you're planning.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.985
Like I told you all
when we first crashed here
and escaped fort rozz,

20:20.987 --> 20:22.653
we are stronger together.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.089
(Panting)

20:25.091 --> 20:27.225
There is a Kryptonian
working with the humans.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.026
My niece, in fact.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.262
She calls herself supergirl.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.066
You will make excellent bait
to help me capture her.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.703
I've seen what happens
to people when they take on
someone wearing that "s."

20:38.705 --> 20:41.672
This is not an invitation,
it's a command.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.513
Okay, boys,
what have you got for me?

20:49.515 --> 20:52.550
Armed robbery at a pizza place
on 5th and Siegel.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.819
Remember, bulletproof means
bullets bounce off of you.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.420
So, if you don't want
anyone to get hurt,

20:56.422 --> 20:57.822
don't let the bad guys
even get a shot off.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.057
Oh, yeah, and also try
not to damage the suit.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.759
I, uh, helped
make that outfit.

21:01.761 --> 21:06.163
-I got some mad sewing skills.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.033
-Get down!
-(Woman screaming)

21:09.035 --> 21:10.368
Now give me your money.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.570
Come on, let's go, let's go.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.174
Kara: <i> Next?</i>

21:17.176 --> 21:18.309
Ambulance caught in traffic
on donner Avenue

21:18.311 --> 21:20.011
carrying a heart attack
victim.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.979
They're not gonna make it to
national city general in time.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.348
Oh, and a fully-loaded
ambulance is about
9,200 pounds,

21:24.350 --> 21:28.185
which would mean that you'd
need to use a maximum of
44,498 Newtons of force...

21:28.187 --> 21:31.589
Kara, what he means is,
gently this time.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.928
Female newscaster:
<i> Supergirl rescued an ambulance</i>
<i> stuck in traffic,</i>

21:37.930 --> 21:39.597
<i> saving the life</i>
<i> of a man inside.</i>

21:39.599 --> 21:41.866
Male newscaster:
<i> Another super save</i>
<i> for supergirl.</i>

21:41.868 --> 21:44.368
<i> Looks like national city's</i>
<i> hero is starting to</i>
<i> live up to her name.</i>

21:44.370 --> 21:47.371
Oh! This one's
the fire department.

21:47.373 --> 21:50.007
Ha! Kara, you're gonna
love this one, it's a classic.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.475
<i> Kitten up a tree.</i>

21:53.746 --> 21:54.912
Fluffy!

21:55.948 --> 21:57.882
Here you go.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.818
(Clears throat)
I thought you said
it was a cat.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.653
Who names her snake fluffy?

22:07.327 --> 22:10.161
Male newscaster:
<i> A dazzling display of heroics</i>
<i> by the girl of steel</i>

22:10.163 --> 22:14.365
<i> now has a grateful</i>
<i> national city asking,</i>
<i> "what oil spill?"</i>

22:14.367 --> 22:16.367
<i> -Watch out, Metropolis.</i>
-(Chuckling)

22:16.369 --> 22:18.669
<i> Looks like we're about</i>
<i> to give you a run</i>
<i> for your superhero money!</i>

22:18.671 --> 22:21.272
I can't believe it.
It's working.

22:21.274 --> 22:23.974
People are really starting
to believe in her.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.109
In you.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.244
I couldn't have done it
without you.

22:27.714 --> 22:28.913
Thank you.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.449
Both of you.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.518
(Knocking on door)

22:34.520 --> 22:37.455
God, what, did you
order more pizza?
You're a beast.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.323
-Kara? Kara, the cape.
-Your cape...

22:41.994 --> 22:43.327
Can we talk?

22:50.703 --> 22:54.205
Do you really think
it was a good idea for you to
tell your friends who you are?

22:54.207 --> 22:56.507
Yes, because
they're my friends.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.843
I'm allowed to have friends,
aren't I?

22:58.845 --> 23:01.045
Or is that also
against deo rules?

23:01.047 --> 23:03.481
I didn't come here to fight,

23:03.483 --> 23:05.516
I came here to apologize.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.818
For how I handled things
back at the deo.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.421
Maybe it wasn't the right way
to go about it,

23:10.423 --> 23:12.656
but... you have
got to understand

23:12.658 --> 23:14.825
I was only looking out
for you.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.761
You always have
looked out for me,

23:16.763 --> 23:19.630
since the day my cousin
dropped me off at your house.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.565
(Sighs)

23:21.567 --> 23:23.901
Do you remember how scared
you were of the popcorn maker?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.236
(Laughs) Yeah.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.571
You crawled under the table
next to me.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.306
Showed me the melted butter

23:29.308 --> 23:31.842
and sprinkled the tiny,
white crystals...

23:33.479 --> 23:36.580
But I'm not a scared
little girl anymore.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.884
Yeah, but I will always be
your big sister.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.719
That doesn't just
suddenly change

23:41.721 --> 23:43.854
because last week you decided
to fight criminals.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.657
Well, last week I found out
you don't work in a lab.

23:46.659 --> 23:49.260
You're out there fighting,
risking your life,

23:49.262 --> 23:50.828
and I still trust you.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.565
I...

23:54.567 --> 23:56.967
I know I have a lot to learn.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.970
And James and winn
believe in me, but...

24:01.474 --> 24:03.541
I need your faith, Alex.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.546
More than that "s,"
more than that cape...

24:10.883 --> 24:12.450
More than anyone's.

24:13.386 --> 24:14.785
(Phone ringing)

24:16.756 --> 24:18.789
Danvers.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.091
-I'll be right there.
-(Phone beeps)

24:21.093 --> 24:22.827
They need me back at the deo.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.296
I'll call you.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.703
What's the news
on the hellgrammite?

24:32.705 --> 24:35.906
We've confirmed six similar
attacks on chemical plants
across the country

24:35.908 --> 24:37.274
over the past year.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.243
He's been making his way
to national city

24:39.245 --> 24:41.245
with enough chemical
components to build
a weapon of mass destruction.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.447
I'm not so sure
about that, sir.

24:43.449 --> 24:47.651
The tests we ran on his blood
indicate his alien DNA isn't
carbon-based like humans.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.920
It has a chlorine foundation.

24:49.922 --> 24:53.123
Each of those facilities
stored confiscated ddt,

24:53.125 --> 24:55.359
which is a chlorine pesticide.

24:55.361 --> 24:58.729
Well, if he's not
building a weapon,
what does he need ddt for?

24:59.499 --> 25:01.665
-He's eating it.
-Right.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.801
Given his home planet's
atmospheric conditions,

25:03.803 --> 25:06.437
ddt would be
the closest thing on earth
he could find to food.

25:06.439 --> 25:08.172
Since ddt was banned,

25:08.174 --> 25:11.041
the government
has been destroying
remaining stockpiles.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.510
His food source is shrinking.

25:12.512 --> 25:15.579
Well, if this thing is hungry,

25:15.581 --> 25:18.215
let's buy him some dinner.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.284
Woman newscaster:
<i> Eat your heart out,</i>
<i> Metropolis,</i>

25:20.286 --> 25:21.919
<i> it looks like supergirl</i>
<i> is here to stay.</i>

25:21.921 --> 25:24.188
Ms. Grant,
you wanted to see me?

25:24.190 --> 25:28.292
James, I was wondering
how the hunt for the interview
with supergirl is going.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.394
Oh, she's doing
a little better,

25:30.396 --> 25:32.563
so I wasn't really sure
if you were still interested
in controlling the story.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.999
Oh, I want a sit down with her
before the <i> planet.</i>

25:35.001 --> 25:39.069
Maybe I was beating
around the bush
too much earlier.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.971
No, you were pretty clear.

25:40.973 --> 25:45.442
The "s" is not some
"who wore it best"
fashion faux pas.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.711
It's a team logo.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.716
Maybe supergirl is his sister,
maybe it's his girlfriend,

25:52.718 --> 25:54.585
but there's definitely
a connection.

25:54.587 --> 25:57.054
And because you are
famously "his pal,"

25:57.056 --> 25:58.956
I have to wonder

25:58.958 --> 26:01.725
why you haven't
exploited that relationship
to get me what I want.

26:03.362 --> 26:06.730
I have a policy
against using my friends
for business reasons.

26:06.732 --> 26:11.035
And I have a policy
against losing.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.871
Whose policy do you think
means more to me?

26:16.976 --> 26:19.777
No, I get it.
You're an honorable guy.

26:19.779 --> 26:23.113
So I'm asking you to do
what's right by me
and this company

26:23.115 --> 26:25.549
and get me in a room
with that girl.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.451
<i> You have 24 hours.</i>

26:29.455 --> 26:31.088
Or?

26:31.090 --> 26:34.525
Or the <i> planet</i> gets their
beloved photojournalist back.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.507
(Sighs)

26:56.182 --> 26:59.316
Dispatcher:
<i> Greyhound, this is trap one,</i>
<i> no sign of the hostile.</i>

26:59.318 --> 27:00.851
Copy, trap one. Stay alert.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.754
Let's hope this movable feast
is too hard to resist.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.290
Given the hellgrammite's
superior sense of smell,

27:06.292 --> 27:09.293
he should've sensed the ddt
in the atmosphere by now.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.862
Then where the hell is he?

27:11.864 --> 27:14.064
Trap one, the target
is on your vehicle!

27:27.013 --> 27:28.178
(Man screaming)

27:31.017 --> 27:32.549
(Stingers shooting)

27:35.955 --> 27:37.221
(Screaming)

27:38.924 --> 27:40.124
(Hissing)

27:41.260 --> 27:42.559
Hank: Alex!

27:54.707 --> 27:56.774
Astra:
Where is the Kryptonian?

27:57.443 --> 27:59.476
She didn't show.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.845
But this is one of
the human agents.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.948
I'm hoping it's enough
to keep you off my back.

28:06.852 --> 28:10.120
I've been waiting quite some
time to get one of you alive.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.264
(Clears throat) Hey.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.433
Uh, winn and I are gonna
head back to my place,

28:22.435 --> 28:25.502
listen to the scanner
and do a little super hero-ing

28:25.504 --> 28:27.171
if you wanna come?

28:27.173 --> 28:30.007
I think I'm gonna
take tonight off
if you don't mind.

28:30.009 --> 28:33.210
Just got some things
i should think about.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.446
Look, I know I said
i wouldn't do the interview,

28:35.448 --> 28:36.513
but I'll do it.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.248
I don't want you
getting fired.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.717
(Chuckles)

28:41.220 --> 28:43.854
-I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.
-(Chuckles)

28:45.224 --> 28:46.590
(Inhales deeply)

28:46.592 --> 28:50.494
You know, it's been
like this for a while.

28:50.496 --> 28:54.364
Back when I first started,
i was this nervous kid
with his camera,

28:54.366 --> 28:56.867
just trying to get noticed.

28:56.869 --> 29:00.204
And then one day,
everybody knew my name.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.508
And not because of
anything I did.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.909
Not really.

29:07.179 --> 29:10.247
It's because I was friends
with somebody

29:10.249 --> 29:11.982
who was making a difference.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.219
I don't know, I just...

29:15.221 --> 29:19.189
I thought... I could escape
all that when I moved here.

29:21.694 --> 29:23.260
Be my own man, you know.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.195
(Both chuckle)

29:25.197 --> 29:29.032
Back on Krypton,
no one was their own man.

29:29.034 --> 29:33.804
Growing up, I was taught that
to accept help from people
is not a shame, it's an honor.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.542
Your cousin never talks
about Krypton.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.711
He was a baby when we left.

29:40.713 --> 29:42.546
But I remember it.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.747
All the time.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.082
(Chuckles)

29:45.084 --> 29:47.217
Did he ever tell you
what that "s" means?

29:48.554 --> 29:50.254
The house of El.

29:50.256 --> 29:54.825
Yes, but, it also stands
for a Kryptonian phrase,
our family motto.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.560
"El mayarah."

29:56.562 --> 29:59.029
It means, "stronger together."

30:01.700 --> 30:06.937
You say people will see me
the way they see superman
one day, but...

30:06.939 --> 30:09.106
I don't want to be
a hero like him.

30:10.543 --> 30:14.978
My cousin, he's so used
to going it alone,

30:14.980 --> 30:17.114
he doesn't know any other way.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.182
But I do.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.184
I see it now.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.754
You, winn, my sister,
Ms. Grant even,

30:23.756 --> 30:25.355
you've all showed me that.

30:28.561 --> 30:32.996
James, part of being
your own man is knowing
when to accept help.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.239
You really want to do
that interview?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.373
(Chuckles)

30:43.375 --> 30:46.343
First, I was scared,
but I'm not anymore.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.878
I want to do it.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.880
For me?

30:49.882 --> 30:52.549
For what we're trying
to do here together.

30:52.551 --> 30:53.884
For us.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.853
(Phone ringing)

30:56.322 --> 30:57.421
Sorry.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.690
Hello.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.892
It's henshaw.
There's been an incident.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.028
Your sister's been abducted.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.767
I should've been there.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.003
If I was there...

31:13.005 --> 31:15.839
If you trusted me instead of
putting me through your tests,

31:15.841 --> 31:17.174
I could've stopped this.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.343
Or maybe you'd be captured
and dead too.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.144
I know, to you,
she's just an agent,

31:21.146 --> 31:23.513
but to me, she's my family.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.915
Does that mean
anything to you?

31:24.917 --> 31:26.283
Do you have a family?

31:27.086 --> 31:28.252
I did.

31:30.723 --> 31:34.191
Look, we have every satellite
and tactical drone
up in the air,

31:34.193 --> 31:35.926
searching this whole city
for her.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.995
And now you have me too.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.407
-(People speaking)
-(Bell ringing)

31:50.409 --> 31:53.310
-(Sirens blaring)
-(Vehicles honking)

32:02.054 --> 32:03.954
Astra: You're bleeding.

32:04.890 --> 32:06.490
Human beings are so fragile.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.326
It's amazing any of you
make it out of infancy.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.362
Alura...

32:15.034 --> 32:17.334
How do you know that name?

32:17.336 --> 32:19.303
I saw a hologram of you.

32:19.972 --> 32:23.140
A message from Krypton.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.777
It was on the ship
that brought your daughter
to earth.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.146
Twins were rare on Krypton.

32:29.148 --> 32:33.550
When we were children, alura
and I took great pleasure
in confusing our parents.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.785
You're alura's sister.

32:34.787 --> 32:37.020
I am general astra.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.489
And what is your name?

32:44.863 --> 32:46.430
You are very brave.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.566
Braver than most of your race.

32:49.568 --> 32:53.670
There is no reason to kill me,
or anyone in national city.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.106
Is that what you think?

32:56.108 --> 32:59.009
That my goal is simply
to kill humans?

32:59.011 --> 33:00.978
You are so very wrong.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.214
I am here to save you all.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.984
Supergirl will find me.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.086
Alex.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.588
Director henshaw, I got her.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.491
<i> A warehouse at the corner</i>
<i> of 78th and Washington.</i>

33:14.493 --> 33:15.759
<i> I'm going to get her back.</i>

33:15.761 --> 33:17.494
Miss danvers, wait.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.929
(Clicks tongue)

33:20.933 --> 33:22.833
Get a strike team ready.
We're moving out.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.201
Yes, sir.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.073
Alex.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.142
No! Get out of here,
it's a trap.

33:33.379 --> 33:34.511
(Kara screaming)

33:34.513 --> 33:35.912
(Grunts)

33:40.853 --> 33:43.053
It's been a long time,
little one.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.489
(Panting)

33:50.195 --> 33:51.561
Astra: Look how you've grown.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.398
So beautiful.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.733
But you...

33:56.735 --> 33:58.035
You died.

34:00.005 --> 34:01.772
When Krypton exploded...

34:03.175 --> 34:04.741
Everyone died.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.912
You died...

34:10.115 --> 34:11.515
Aunt astra.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.750
Except I wasn't on Krypton
when it perished.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.685
I was a prisoner
aboard fort rozz.

34:17.189 --> 34:19.623
Did your mother not tell you?

34:19.625 --> 34:21.892
How she sent me away?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.394
Banished her own blood?

34:24.396 --> 34:27.464
Imprisoned me
for speaking the truth
while she told only lies?

34:27.466 --> 34:29.399
But why did she send you
to fort rozz?

34:29.401 --> 34:30.834
For being a hero.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.738
For trying to save our world.

34:37.209 --> 34:42.646
I remember so many nights,
sitting on your lap,

34:42.648 --> 34:44.948
listening as you taught me
all the names of the stars.

34:44.950 --> 34:49.286
Then let me educate you
once again, dear niece.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.354
Your alliance with
the humans is misplaced.

34:51.356 --> 34:54.724
Do not stand against me.

34:54.726 --> 34:58.595
I let one planet die,
i will not do so again.

34:58.597 --> 35:02.532
Funny, I was going to say
the same thing.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.873
(Grunts)

35:24.089 --> 35:25.355
(Grunts)

35:25.357 --> 35:27.390
Greyhound,
this is trap leader, over.

35:27.392 --> 35:29.025
Greyhound, do you copy?

35:32.498 --> 35:34.965
Maybe I was wrong about you.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.066
Join me, little one.

35:36.068 --> 35:37.767
Never call me that again.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.108
(Grunts) Ahhh!

35:45.110 --> 35:46.543
It's nothing personal.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.579
Just every species
has a will to survive.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.781
Know what most species
also have?

35:52.384 --> 35:53.817
Those.

35:53.819 --> 35:54.985
(Grunts)

35:56.121 --> 35:57.521
(Gasps)

36:29.488 --> 36:30.954
You chose for it
to end like this,

36:30.956 --> 36:32.589
instead of allying
with your family.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.958
Now you can die alone.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.093
You might wanna
rethink the cape.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.105
(Both grunting)

36:50.976 --> 36:52.976
Alex: <i> When you are facing</i>
<i> a superior opponent,</i>

36:52.978 --> 36:54.978
you use their strength
against them.

36:59.218 --> 37:00.884
(Panting)

37:02.454 --> 37:03.820
Hey!

37:06.258 --> 37:07.757
Are you okay?

37:11.129 --> 37:13.997
I saw on the news you haven't
quite mastered that one yet.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.865
Hank: Stop.
Stay where you are.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.000
(Laughs)

37:18.670 --> 37:20.036
(Groaning)

37:20.038 --> 37:22.239
You possess no weapon
that could harm me.

37:22.241 --> 37:23.873
You are so wrong.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.775
(Screaming)

37:34.519 --> 37:36.620
Any more family
i should know about?

37:37.122 --> 37:38.622
(Both sigh)

37:42.294 --> 37:43.827
(Whispers) Okay.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.997
(Exhales)

37:46.999 --> 37:49.332
I wish I had your
healing powers.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.768
You took down the hellgrammite
with no help from me.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.803
Yeah, well,
you were a little busy.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.876
I can't even imagine
what you must be feeling
right now.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.746
I mean, after all this time,

38:02.748 --> 38:04.781
finding out you still
have family.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.651
You're my family.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.185
My aunt...

38:10.255 --> 38:11.988
We have to stop her.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.891
I have to be ready
for her next time.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.793
Show me how to fight.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.763
Train me to be as good as you.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.331
I'll make you even better.

38:23.402 --> 38:28.972
On Krypton, I remember
aunt astra and my mother
always arguing.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.341
Like sisters do.

38:31.343 --> 38:34.210
And when I asked my mother
why they could never
get along, she said

38:34.212 --> 38:37.280
that it was because astra
didn't have faith in people.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.217
You wanted to know
if I have faith in you.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.655
I do. I always have.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.358
When you first came
to live with us,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.660
my parents told me
that you would be sad

38:50.662 --> 38:51.828
and fragile,

38:51.830 --> 38:54.731
having just lost your world,

38:54.733 --> 38:58.134
your parents, friends.

38:58.136 --> 39:01.838
But you never let that loss
diminish your light.

39:03.075 --> 39:06.142
You've always had
the heart of a hero, Kara,

39:06.144 --> 39:08.144
way before you put on
that "s."

39:09.281 --> 39:11.614
(Both laugh softly)

39:11.616 --> 39:14.084
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.187
There's something
that I need to show you.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.856
Something I've been
working on.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.393
Your cousin has a base,

39:23.395 --> 39:26.062
it's a fortress, I guess,
in the arctic.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.331
Now, we don't know
much about it,

39:28.333 --> 39:32.669
but we do know it's a place
that he's been able to commune
with his Kryptonian ancestors.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.604
How? They're all gone.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.273
They're no longer alive, yes.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.044
The door will only
open for you.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.294
Mom.

39:58.296 --> 39:59.462
Hello, Kara.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.898
(Exhales)

40:01.900 --> 40:05.168
Wait... I don't understand.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.203
The message we found
in your pod,

40:07.205 --> 40:10.640
it was part of an interactive
artificial intelligence
program,

40:10.642 --> 40:12.976
that's culled
from living memory.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.779
It's not really her, but...

40:15.781 --> 40:20.116
Kara, I have been programmed
to offer you assistance
here on earth.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.587
Thank you, Alex.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.922
I'll let you two talk.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.828
I...

40:33.198 --> 40:35.398
I'm not quite sure
what to ask.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.202
Whatever it is you wish
you could ask alura,
you may ask me.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.941
(Crying) I'd ask for a hug.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.076
I am not programmed
to do that.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.481
(Sniffles)

40:52.918 --> 40:55.452
Then tell me about
my aunt astra.

41:00.058 --> 41:04.594
Director henshaw,
thank you for helping me
set up that room.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.430
It's the least I can do
for supergirl.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.966
I won't tell her
you called her that.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.102
I'd appreciate it.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.043
(Astra groans)

41:21.246 --> 41:22.312
(Screams)

41:25.116 --> 41:28.218
Kryptonians are nearly
indestructible on earth.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.286
How could that blade hurt me?

41:30.288 --> 41:32.555
Unclear. I've never seen
anything like it.

41:32.557 --> 41:33.857
(Groaning)

41:33.859 --> 41:35.992
It's definitely
not from this planet.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.902
It seems to be emitting
a specific radioactivity

41:45.904 --> 41:48.137
that's damaging
to your cellular structure.

41:48.139 --> 41:49.873
It's still making me sick.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.774
Get it away from me.

41:51.776 --> 41:54.377
Get it out of here.

41:54.379 --> 41:57.814
Man: <i> The humans are more canny</i>
<i> than we predicted.</i>

41:57.816 --> 41:59.883
Until we learn to neutralize
this weapon they possess,

41:59.885 --> 42:02.986
we might have to rethink
our timetable for taking
national city.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.587
Man: And what of Kara zor El?

42:04.589 --> 42:09.025
My niece, she is stronger
than I thought.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.895
She's not just a little girl
from Krypton anymore.

42:14.499 --> 42:20.169
Uh, Mr. Olsen, I know that
i gave you 24 hours to get me
that interview with supergirl,

42:20.171 --> 42:23.072
but if you haven't
procured it by now,

42:23.074 --> 42:27.510
I would like to set up some
interviews with new
art directors for tomorrow.

42:27.512 --> 42:29.445
Eyes on the road up there.

42:29.447 --> 42:32.982
Actually, Ms. Grant,
your interview with
supergirl's already started.

42:32.984 --> 42:35.084
<i> Look out your window.</i>

42:37.822 --> 42:39.522
What the hell?

42:59.411 --> 43:00.577
Kara: Ms. Grant.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.884
James Olsen said
you wanna talk.

43:09.287 --> 43:10.620
Let's talk.
