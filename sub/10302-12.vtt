01:57.040 --> 01:59.156
God, men are stupid.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.116
And then there's Al.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.473
I can't believe he is really
at the park playing football...

02:10.680 --> 02:12.796
...with Aaron and a bunch
of college boys.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.235
Well, why? He says he's in shape.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.549
Oh, please. If Al didn't have to bend
over to steal our paper every morning...

02:19.800 --> 02:21.995
...he wouldn't get any exercise at all.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.439
Yeah, but, you know, in Al's defence,
football has always meant a lot to him.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.753
In fact, it's the only time
he can still go deep.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.356
Besides, what could go wrong?

02:37.880 --> 02:41.429
Mrs. Bundy, something's gone wrong.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.637
It's your husband's back.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.873
For the last time, I tell you, I'm fine.
I'm fine, I tell you!

02:48.920 --> 02:51.753
Easy, now.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.351
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Why, is the pain too much?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.955
No, I see a nickel.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.153
All right, get me on the couch.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.514
Football is so stupid.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.230
Why don't you men do something
positive with your free time?

03:27.480 --> 03:30.392
Do you know what my women's group
and I were doing this morning?

03:30.640 --> 03:34.394
Having "This side up" mowed
into the hair on their chests?

03:36.400 --> 03:40.109
No. Actually, we were
at an environmental seminar...

03:40.360 --> 03:44.035
...discussing ways to save
the nation's topsoil.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.557
And I can see
by the back of your neck here...

03:47.800 --> 03:50.394
...that you've already done
more than your part.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.268
How bad is it, Aaron?

03:52.520 --> 03:53.748
We took him to my doctor.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.349
He says all Mr. Bundy needs
is a minor operation.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.353
They make this little circular incision
in his lower back...

03:59.600 --> 04:02.478
...ease the pressure off his spine,
and he's good as new.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.797
Good going, crazy legs.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.678
Now you need an operation.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.753
I'm fine! Don't you see, I'm fine!

04:10.880 --> 04:13.872
Fine? Fine for what, Al?

04:14.120 --> 04:18.398
Starring in the circus
as Bundo the Fiddler Crab Boy?

04:19.360 --> 04:22.989
Ringing bells in
a clock tower somewhere?

04:23.280 --> 04:27.558
Granted, they're both higher-paying
jobs than the one you have now.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.189
But I would imagine
that by the time you get home...

04:30.440 --> 04:32.829
...you'd wanna be fully erect.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.512
But then again...

04:38.160 --> 04:42.153
You know, our coach taught us some
great massage techniques for the back.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.799
Yeah, you wanna give it a try?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.632
Well, I don't mind...

04:48.960 --> 04:52.236
Oh, there goes my back again.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.913
Could you boys help me home
and up the stairs...

04:58.160 --> 05:01.869
...and into my bedroom and out
of these uncomfortable clothes?

05:02.120 --> 05:04.554
Well, sure.
Only if it'll make you feel better.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.155
Oh, it will. It will.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.074
You boys like pina coladas?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.833
Where you going, Peg?

05:16.080 --> 05:19.675
I am calling the hospital
about your operation.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.633
Al...

05:25.880 --> 05:27.438
...look at you.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.355
- You have got to get this taken care of.
- But I'm fine.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.272
You are going to the hospital.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.954
I am not going to the hos...

05:37.800 --> 05:41.713
All I need is a hot shower
and a little bit of rest.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.918
You'll see, by tomorrow
I'll be my old self.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.517
Hello, operator.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.796
I just have to get around
this couch here.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.110
I'd like the number
of the hospital, please.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.318
Up the stairs, wherever they are.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.915
Which one? Oh, I don't know.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.276
What's the cheapest one?

06:05.760 --> 06:08.672
No, an ambulance
won't be necessary.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.309
A hearse may be good.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.828
No, Marce.

06:17.040 --> 06:22.114
"Men Who Leave Their Wives for
IHOP Waitresses" is on Geraldo.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.790
Al? He's been in surgery
for about an hour now.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.433
Look, ma'am, my wife
has just given birth to triplets.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.395
Well, congratulations.
Who's the father?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.036
So anyway, Al just keeps going on...

06:37.240 --> 06:39.470
...about how something bad
is gonna happen to him.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.069
And I say,
"Look, it's a simple operation.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.198
What are the odds of
something horrible happening to you?"

06:45.600 --> 06:49.559
Excuse me, Mrs. Bundy, but something
horrible has happened to your husband.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.960
Marcie, can I call you back?

06:53.480 --> 06:56.597
She says no,
and can you speak louder?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.991
There is some good news. He's alive.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.435
Well, how alive? Can he walk?

07:02.680 --> 07:05.433
Can he talk?
Will he ever be able to work again?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.000
He's a shoe salesman,
Mrs. Bundy.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.028
We could replace his brain
with a sock of popcorn...

07:12.280 --> 07:14.316
...he would still be able to work.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.275
See, this was one of those...

07:17.520 --> 07:19.954
...unfortunate accidents
due to simple human error.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.431
It seems our surgical team misread
your doctor's instructions.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.716
It said to give him
"a circular incision."

07:26.680 --> 07:30.195
Yeah. So how
could you misread that?

07:31.240 --> 07:34.391
We gave him a circumcision.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.831
Oh, dear.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.077
Where is he?

07:52.560 --> 07:54.471
That's the other thing.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.077
Just when you thought all the disasters
that could happen to Dad...

08:24.280 --> 08:27.750
...have happened to Dad...
- Yeah, circumcision.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.311
And we thought he was in a mood
when they cut his hair too short.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.674
Now we can't even tell him
it'll grow back.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.308
Can we?

08:38.720 --> 08:41.359
Yeah, why not?
We lied about his hair.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.597
I just hope we got
all Dad's magazines.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.276
Mom said it was important to get rid
of anything that could turn Dad on...

08:48.520 --> 08:50.670
...before he's had a chance to heal.

08:52.440 --> 08:57.195
Wow, 30 days without sex.
What's that like?

08:57.840 --> 09:00.957
Thirty days is nothing.
I mean, I've gone as f...

09:05.960 --> 09:07.791
Well, I don't know.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.158
What was that?

09:14.480 --> 09:15.708
- Dad.
- Dad.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.832
They're rounding the corner
up the street. Hurry up with those.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.308
What about this People?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.437
- Who's on the cover?
- It's Ross Perot.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.353
Hide it. Dad said
that his ears look like tiny hooters.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.917
Dad is sick.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.072
Okay, where are they now?

09:41.320 --> 09:44.596
They're about to go over the hump
at the intersection.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.356
And now the three small potholes
in front of the McGinty's.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.836
And now the big one.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.872
Hurry before they get
in the driveway.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.550
- You think Mom's gonna hit the curb?
- No.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.433
Oh, sweet baby Jane.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.989
- I'm ready. Where should I put them?
- In the basement.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.913
Okay. Wait a sec. How do you know
Dad won't go down here?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.515
Because we never fixed the step.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.638
Here they come.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.155
Well, Mr. Grumpy's home.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.514
Just a small word of warning.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.752
Anyone who says,
"What's up?" goes down.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.513
It wasn't funny
when the doctor asked it.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.036
It wasn't funny
when the nurse asked it.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.238
It certainly wasn't funny
when your mother asked it.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.353
But then again,
I've been asking for years.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.714
- Is that you, son?
- Yeah, Dad. What's up?

11:08.680 --> 11:10.079
Any other questions?

11:11.040 --> 11:13.713
Yeah. So how's your...?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.872
Your back?

11:17.720 --> 11:21.713
Fine. Not that they did
anything to it, but...

11:22.080 --> 11:25.550
For some odd reason
I feel less concerned about it.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.120
Peg, would you have any idea
why I'd feel less concerned about it?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.872
I do, I do.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.519
- Pumpkin?
- Because you're in so much more pain...

11:40.720 --> 11:43.109
...from the circumcision.

11:43.840 --> 11:47.435
Correct. And while we're
on that subject, does anyone know...

11:47.680 --> 11:51.070
...why such a wacky thing could have
happened to Daddy in the first place?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.188
Pumpkin?

11:59.400 --> 12:01.994
Because Mommy made you
go to the hospital?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.832
Close, sweetheart.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.358
Mommy married Daddy first,
then made him go to the hospital.

12:08.840 --> 12:13.231
Son, you've come to just in time,
because here's something really funny.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.072
Did you know that Daddy's nurse...

12:15.280 --> 12:18.431
...was a fat woman
who used to come to his shoe store?

12:18.640 --> 12:22.474
I say "used to" because her patronage
fell off one day when she asked...

12:22.680 --> 12:26.309
...for something to make her foot
look small, and I said, "Try your ass."

12:33.320 --> 12:35.470
She remembered.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.118
And we laughed.

12:38.360 --> 12:42.990
Then she picked up a catheter the size
of a boa constrictor and charged.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.039
And all of a sudden...

12:45.280 --> 12:47.953
...for just a brief moment
in a land far away...

12:48.200 --> 12:50.634
...there was Abraham,
Martin and Al...

12:50.880 --> 12:53.314
...saying if it wasn't for the wife...
- AI.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.199
I am very, very sorry about this.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.078
And if there's anything I can do...

12:58.320 --> 12:59.799
Swim the deepest ocean...

13:00.040 --> 13:04.238
...climb the highest mountain.
- just tell me and I'll do it.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.508
How about a sandwich?

13:07.760 --> 13:10.149
A sandwich?

13:10.440 --> 13:11.998
Now?

13:13.720 --> 13:16.234
Kids, did Daddy tell you
he got some stitches?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.954
Okay. Okay.
I'll make you a sandwich.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.758
Thank you.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.318
Now, it's over,
as far as I'm concerned.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.028
Everything is back to normal.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.758
What?

13:44.840 --> 13:47.798
Well, how much
did they cut off, Dad?

13:49.800 --> 13:51.119
No, Kelly.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.909
It's just that he won't be able
to wear anything tight for a while.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.515
So I brought him something
of Grandma's.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.549
Fortunately, all I needed
was the sleeve. I sent the rest back.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.198
And by the way, I don't want
anyone talking about this, Peg.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.192
Especially you.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.035
Oh, come on, Al. I'm as embarrassed
about this as you are.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.589
Besides, who would I tell?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.672
Hey, stubby.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.358
We heard about what happened,
so we got you a card.

14:33.120 --> 14:38.274
I talked her out of the "Ask me about
my circumcision" bumper sticker.

14:39.840 --> 14:43.310
We heard about your little loss
We know you'll mak e it through

14:43.560 --> 14:48.111
Because thankfully the part they took
Was of no use to you

14:49.440 --> 14:51.556
And though they took
More than you'd lik e

14:51.760 --> 14:53.159
The good luck is, you see

14:53.400 --> 14:57.393
Another quarter inch'd been
A full lobotomy

15:00.000 --> 15:01.797
P. S:

15:05.720 --> 15:07.438
Kids, a lesson.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.830
Whenever you receive
a card like this...

15:10.080 --> 15:13.038
...it must be answered immediately
by a thank-you note.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.910
So would you please go key one
in the side of Marcie's car for Daddy?

15:19.640 --> 15:20.868
Sure, Dad.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.913
Whoa, whoa.
Now, wait a second here.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.311
You guys know that Marcie's
is the red Beemer, right?

15:27.520 --> 15:30.193
- Come on, we know.
- Mr. D'Arcy, we wouldn't do that to you.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.755
Okay. Go to it, then.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.150
Cranky, huh, old buddy?

15:39.400 --> 15:42.198
Well, I know exactly how you feel.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.556
I had to get circumcised myself once.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.877
- How'd you deal with the pain?
- I don't know. I was only one day old.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.075
So, what's up?

16:02.960 --> 16:06.077
Oh, Marcie,
I feel just awful about this.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.436
The pain he must be in.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.955
And it's all my fault.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.919
Well, just do what you can
to take his mind off it.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.196
Well, I do.

16:23.280 --> 16:28.195
It's just that for some reason,
he cannot seem to let go of it.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.999
I don't know what to do.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.196
Well, just give it a few days.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.069
Besides, I hear there are some benefits
to having a circumcised man.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.629
They're healthier, the sex is better...

16:49.880 --> 16:52.599
...they're less likely...
- Whoa.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.270
- The sex is better?
- For the woman.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.795
Well, that's all I care about.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.919
Go on.

17:01.160 --> 17:06.233
Well, they say it lasts longer
because the man is less sensitive.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.192
Of course, you're gonna have to wait
about a month to find out.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.873
Hey, with Al I can do
a month standing on my head.

17:22.119 --> 17:24.270
Sometimes I have to.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.109
Sometimes I like it.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.396
Tonight our special report.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.313
Thong bikinis of Rio.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.237
Thong bikinis of Hawaii.

18:03.920 --> 18:08.311
- Thong bikinis of the Caribbean.
- It's sweeps month.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.791
Gotta be something on
that's dull and boring.

18:12.320 --> 18:16.871
Tonight on National Geographic,
stalking the wily prairie dog.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.348
That's better.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.996
But first, thong bikinis
of the Serengeti.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.919
Good one.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.955
Hi, honey. I'm sorry I'm late.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.839
But bingo was just
a madhouse tonight.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.593
So how's it going?

18:34.840 --> 18:38.355
Horrible, Peg.
Everything I see or hear is about sex.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.268
Oh, Al, that's just your imagination.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.637
There's plenty
of other things going on.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.279
Tell me about bingo.

18:48.680 --> 18:53.800
Well, we overheard this couple
going at it in the bathroom.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.514
Don't know how they thought
they could get away with it.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.188
I mean, you could hear her
a whole block away.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.477
"Oh, Al."
His name was Al too.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.474
"Oh, Al." On and on.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.879
What was that sound?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.958
A stitch.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.876
Well, it's time to get
this couch reupholstered.

19:22.120 --> 19:26.989
I'm really glad I'm home.
I am so tired.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.113
Peg. Do you mind?

19:35.360 --> 19:36.713
Mind what?

19:36.960 --> 19:39.315
When you shake your leg
like that it...

19:39.960 --> 19:42.633
It makes your boobies
go back and forth.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.072
Sorry.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.236
Would you stop putting your finger
in your mouth when you turn the page?

20:01.280 --> 20:03.748
I always do that.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.875
It's the first time I've looked at you.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.753
All right, Al. I'll stop.

20:19.560 --> 20:23.189
- What?
- You're breathing in and out.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.948
This is ridiculous.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.397
I'm getting myself a snack
and then I'm going to bed.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.471
You know, your problem is, Al...

20:31.720 --> 20:35.599
...you just can't allow yourself
to think about anything else.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.598
You know, read a book,
watch a ball game.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.435
You know, my life is miserable too,
but you don't see me going nuts.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.237
By the way, honey...

20:50.480 --> 20:53.392
...do you want anything
while I'm in here?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.272
Al?

20:59.920 --> 21:01.148
Al?

21:06.520 --> 21:08.351
A shower?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.431
This early?

21:10.680 --> 21:14.195
Gee, it's only
the 10th of the month.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.553
Well, I don't like this, Marcie.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.071
He's been in the garage
past a month now...

21:23.320 --> 21:25.993
...and I still can't get him
to come out.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.629
I mean, suppose
something went wrong?

21:28.880 --> 21:32.156
He was really starting
to like those muumuus.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.631
Yeah, well, suppose he's all well...

21:35.880 --> 21:38.633
...and he just doesn't
want me anymore?

21:58.520 --> 22:00.795
Never mind.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.155
You know, it did last longer.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.913
And the best part is
I didn't feel a thing.

22:48.305 --> 22:54.853
