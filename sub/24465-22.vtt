Rigby: AW.

00:41.644 --> 00:44.964
IF I WAS IMMORTAL LIKE SKIPS, I
WOULD'VE GONE FOR IT.

00:43.684 --> 00:44.944
Mordecai: YEAH, THAT WOULD BE

00:45.044 --> 00:47.404
AWESOME.
Rigby: BEING IMMORTAL MUST

00:47.524 --> 00:48.824
Skips: MEH, NOT REALLY.

Skips: GOTTA BREATHE.

00:53.245 --> 00:54.665
BEING IMMORTAL DOESN'T CHANGE

00:54.765 --> 00:57.125
THAT.
Rigby: OH, OH, I GOT ONE ââ

00:56.645 --> 01:00.045

01:34.769 --> 01:37.809
EXPELLED FROM THREE SCHOOLS THIS
YEAR ALONE!

01:37.889 --> 01:40.509
AND THIS WAS DUE TO..."FIGHTING

01:40.609 --> 01:43.470

01:43.570 --> 01:45.310
YEAH, I MIGHT'VE DONE SOME OF

01:45.410 --> 01:47.770
THAT.
WELL, ONE FIGHT AT MY SCHOOL,

01:47.450 --> 01:48.630
MR. WALKS, AND THAT MEANS

01:48.730 --> 01:49.310
EXPULSION.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.991
OOH!

04:39.907 --> 04:40.207
OH!

04:40.307 --> 04:41.888
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT NO ONE

04:41.988 --> 04:43.728
CALLS YOU "LKS"?

04:43.828 --> 04:44.728
( LAUGHS )

04:44.828 --> 04:46.728
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT NICKNAME

04:53.909 --> 04:55.609
NO ONE EATS THE SCHOOL LUNCH IF

04:55.709 --> 04:56.649
IT CAN BE AVOIDED.

04:56.749 --> 04:58.449
SOMEHOW, THE KITCHEN EVEN RUINS

04:58.549 --> 04:59.529
APPLE BROWN BETTY.

04:59.629 --> 05:00.329
REALLY?

05:00.429 --> 05:01.890
HOW DOES ONE EVEN DO THAT?

05:01.990 --> 05:02.450

05:14.831 --> 05:15.771
OF THIS CHART ââ

05:15.871 --> 05:16.571
NO NEED.

05:16.671 --> 05:18.371
I WAS GOING TO FIGHT HIM ANYWAY.

05:18.471 --> 05:19.811
OH, SPLENDID.

05:19.911 --> 05:21.732
TO ASSURE KLORGBANE'S DEFEAT,

05:21.832 --> 05:23.572
WE'VE BEGUN DESIGN ON A DEVICE

05:23.672 --> 05:26.932
CALLED...THE FISTS OF JUSTICE,

05:27.032 --> 05:27.772
WHICH WILL ââ

05:27.872 --> 05:29.092
CALL OFF YOUR DESIGN.

05:29.192 --> 05:31.853
ALL THE FISTS I NEED RESIDE IN

05:31.953 --> 05:32.733
MY POCKETS.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.213
HEAR THEM OUT, WALKS.

05:34.313 --> 05:35.853
ARCHIBALD HOLDS A VERY

05:35.953 --> 05:37.493
CONVINCING ILLUSTRATION.

05:37.593 --> 05:39.013
LIKE US, KLORGBANE THE

05:39.113 --> 05:41.214
DESTROYER WAS CREATED IMMORTAL.

05:41.314 --> 05:43.174
HE THEREFORE CANNOT BE DEFEATED

05:43.274 --> 05:46.214
BY A MERE MORTAL.

05:46.314 --> 05:47.294
( WHISTLES )

05:47.394 --> 05:49.014
HOWEVER, WITH THE PROPER

05:49.114 --> 05:50.454
WEAPON, A MORTAL OF YOUR

05:50.554 --> 05:52.375
STRENGTH AND SKILL MAY PREVAIL.

05:52.475 --> 05:54.215
LET ME SEE THAT.

05:54.315 --> 05:55.695
HMM.

05:55.795 --> 05:57.215
I'LL CONSIDER THEM.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.135
WE DO HOPE YOU WILL.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.336
ANYWAY, AT MY LAST SCHOOL ââ

06:03.436 --> 06:05.436

GONE!

06:13.597 --> 06:14.977
I HEARD WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING.

06:15.077 --> 06:17.517
I KNOW.
YOU WERE SITTING RIGHT ACROSS

06:16.877 --> 06:19.237
FROM ME.
WELL, I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

06:18.357 --> 06:21.438
I THOUGHT WE HAD A SPECIAL
CONNECTION, WALKS, BUT I'M NOT

06:20.838 --> 06:22.018
INTO MEN WHO FIGHT.

06:22.118 --> 06:23.418
SO FARE THEE WELL.

06:23.518 --> 06:25.458
WAIT! NO! I DON'T FIGHT!

06:25.558 --> 06:27.498
LOOK. ( LAUGHS ) NO FISTS!

06:27.598 --> 06:28.418
VERY FUNNY.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.538
NO, MONA, PLEASE.

06:29.638 --> 06:30.859
FORGET ABOUT THE FIGHT.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.419
WE <i>DOHAVE A CONNECTION.</i>

06:32.519 --> 06:34.019
LET'S JUST GET TO KNOW EACH

06:34.119 --> 06:35.579
OTHER ââ GO FOR A CANOE RIDE,

06:35.679 --> 06:36.259
PERHAPS.

06:36.359 --> 06:38.019
I'M NOT REALLY INTO CANOES,

06:38.119 --> 06:40.059
EITHER.

06:40.159 --> 06:42.820
YOU LEFT THIS ON THE TABLE.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.660
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REALLY INTO

06:44.760 --> 06:46.620
LITTERBUGS, BUT I WAS WILLING TO

RECONSIDER FOR YOU.

06:48.480 --> 06:48.940

SET OF HANDS MAKING DECORATIONS

06:52.801 --> 06:55.801

THAT'S WHERE I SPEND MY FREE

06:54.841 --> 06:55.341
TIME.

06:55.441 --> 06:57.441
WHERE DO I SIGN UP?

07:00.241 --> 07:01.862
MONA, EVERYBODY WANTS TO

07:01.962 --> 07:03.502
KNOW ââ WHAT'S THE PROM THEME

07:03.602 --> 07:04.302
THIS YEAR?

07:04.402 --> 07:06.262
WELL, IT'S AN UNDERSEA THEME.
