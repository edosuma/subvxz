19:22.596 --> 19:25.076
Aunt Becky stole a guy
that I was talking to online!

19:25.120 --> 19:27.296
No.
You're absolutely wrong.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.211
Your aunt
only went out with him

19:29.255 --> 19:30.430
to make sure
he wasn't a bad guy.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.040
If you
did something wrong,

19:32.083 --> 19:34.477
now would be a really good time
to tell me.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.349
Harris is right. I shouldn't
have gone out with him.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.394
I am sosorry.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.656
What were you thinking?!

19:39.700 --> 19:41.615
I wasn't!

19:41.658 --> 19:43.399
I got divorce papers,

19:43.443 --> 19:45.401
and I guess I was
feeling sorry for myself

19:45.445 --> 19:47.882
because everybody around me
is in love.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.666
Even Darlene,
for God's sake.

19:49.710 --> 19:53.279
You don't know what doing worse
than Darlene does to me.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.587
Harris, uh,
there's no alternative here.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.676
You're gonna have to
hate her forever.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.417
I know what you're doing,

20:01.461 --> 20:04.464
and I'm not gonna
hate you forever.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.031
Life coach.
You don't lose those muscles.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.819
Look, if you want me
to stop seeing him, I will.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.473
No way.
I don't want him now.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.431
I'm not taking
your leftovers.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.564
Then what can I do
to make this up to you?

20:17.607 --> 20:20.610
That was a really crappy thing
you did,

20:20.654 --> 20:22.656
even if you are
old and desperate.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.048
So old, so desperate.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.354
And, I mean,
you see me

20:25.398 --> 20:28.052
and I'm so young,
I'm so beautiful,

20:28.096 --> 20:30.272
and I've got my whole life
ahead of me.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.404
And I'm at the end.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.493
I've got more yesterdays
than tomorrows.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.018
Tell me the truth.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.672
Am I missing out
on a great guy?

20:38.715 --> 20:42.632
Well, I don't know.
It was only one dinner.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.548
Fine.
Go out with him.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.289
It doesn't matter
to me.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.117
I've got a few hits
on the app anyway.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.512
Did you go out
with him, too?

20:52.555 --> 20:53.382
No.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.255
Does he have a twin?

21:01.695 --> 21:03.262
[ Engine idling, door opens ]

21:04.611 --> 21:05.960
Drive, drive, drive!

21:06.003 --> 21:07.178
[ Tires squeal ]

21:07.222 --> 21:09.572
[ Breathing heavily ]

21:09.616 --> 21:11.835
[ Sighs ] Ohh.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.229
Oh, it's like a cloud.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.623
I have shirts
that aren't this soft.

21:16.666 --> 21:17.798
This is ourstash.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.452
The rest of the family
uses the one-ply.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.323
Oh, yeah.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.848
Just when you think you're out,
they pull you back in.

21:24.892 --> 21:25.893
[ Sighs ]
