WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.264
<i>He does everything</i>

00:03.264 --> 00:04.656
<i>he can to get your attention.</i>

00:04.656 --> 00:06.049
<i>But you don't
see Mike at all.</i>

00:06.049 --> 00:07.181
<i>He feels worthless.</i>

00:07.181 --> 00:08.921
One day,
I'm gonna hate you.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.750
What have you been doing
at night, Yolanda?

00:11.750 --> 00:13.274
This is a misunderstanding.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.579
Give me your phone
right this minute

00:14.579 --> 00:16.973
<i>or get out of this house.</i>

00:16.973 --> 00:18.061
Yolanda?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.628
I had nowhere else to go.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.412
We have a preposition
for you.

00:21.412 --> 00:25.068
<i>Courtney and the others
are not your biggest fans.</i>

00:25.068 --> 00:26.635
No.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.071
<i>My grandfather
and grandmother want me</i>

00:28.071 --> 00:30.291
<i>to carry on
my dad's legacy and...</i>

00:30.291 --> 00:31.944
<i>Your father--</i>

00:31.944 --> 00:33.598
<i>His death wasn't
an accident.</i>

00:33.598 --> 00:35.035
<i>I feel guilty
about what happened.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.079
He doesn't know.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.820
You can't tell him.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.604
He is a threat.
No, he's not.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.867
What exactly
is your problem?

00:41.867 --> 00:43.956
I am staring
right at him.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.176
<i>She's teaching
that little psycho</i>

00:46.176 --> 00:47.438
<i>how to conjure up icicles.</i>

00:47.438 --> 00:49.005
I screwed up by keeping

00:49.005 --> 00:50.137
what was happening with Cameron
to myself,

00:50.137 --> 00:51.268
<i>and now Cindy's gone</i>

00:51.268 --> 00:52.791
<i>along with any credibility</i>

00:52.791 --> 00:54.315
<i>I had as the leader
of the JSA.</i>

00:54.315 --> 00:55.316
You turned your back on us

00:55.316 --> 00:56.665
for him, Courtney.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.439
Cameron?

03:50.360 --> 03:52.667
Hi, baby. Come here.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.496
Oh, you must be so exhausted.

03:57.454 --> 04:00.979
- We got some sleep on the bus.
- Yeah?

04:00.979 --> 04:02.067
Where's...

04:02.067 --> 04:04.418
She's in your room.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.817
Pat?
- Yeah.

04:14.993 --> 04:18.083
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.477
You went to that place.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.788
What did you see?

04:31.532 --> 04:33.011
Come here.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.421
Yolanda.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.683
Court.

04:55.686 --> 04:58.472
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.931
I gotta get down
to the Pit Stop,

05:22.931 --> 05:25.020
suit up, join Sylvester
on his hunt.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.631
- Honey, you need to rest.
- I can't.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.938
I mean, we might have
gotten the cameras down,

05:29.938 --> 05:33.333
but we still don't know
who's been watching us.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.247
I need to go help Sylvester.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.466
- Pat?
- Yeah.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.903
What you just went through,

05:38.903 --> 05:41.602
it's not normal for anyone.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.475
Please, just talk to me.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.182
I saw my dad.

06:00.272 --> 06:01.926
What'd he say?

06:01.926 --> 06:06.627
Just the same twisted stuff
he'd tell me when I was a kid.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.759
Only that's not what got to me.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.415
What is it, then?

06:13.634 --> 06:16.419
That place

06:16.419 --> 06:18.682
made me feel like

06:18.682 --> 06:21.990
I'm following
in my father's footsteps.

06:23.731 --> 06:27.691
Making Mike feel like
he's not good enough.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.564
Pat, no, no, no.

06:30.564 --> 06:33.436
Don't you think that
for one second.

06:33.436 --> 06:37.309
Mike is following in
your footsteps, not your dad's.

06:37.309 --> 06:41.183
That's why he's bright
and he's strong and he's kind.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.752
He knows you love him.

06:47.972 --> 06:51.933
I've never talked much
about Mike's mom, have I?

06:51.933 --> 06:53.456
No.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.589
We weren't together long.

06:55.589 --> 06:58.287
Of course, you know that.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.810
And I didn't even know
about Mike

06:59.810 --> 07:03.684
till after we'd split up.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.686
But when I found out...

07:09.254 --> 07:11.082
I mean,
I've never been so happy.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.649
There was nothing
that was gonna keep me

07:12.649 --> 07:15.435
from being in his life.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.349
Of course.

07:17.349 --> 07:21.179
We shared custody
for a couple years.

07:21.179 --> 07:26.620
Then one day,
there's a policeman at the door

07:26.620 --> 07:28.360
with Mike.

07:30.928 --> 07:34.149
He'd been in a shelter overnight,

07:34.149 --> 07:36.151
alone.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.718
Oh, my God.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.198
Maggie had left him there.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.028
And she didn't even
turn up again

07:44.028 --> 07:47.467
till after she'd been arrested
for possession.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.077
I got full custody.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.427
She didn't even put up a fight.

07:53.603 --> 07:56.127
She just walked away from Mike.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.744
And...

08:03.744 --> 08:07.530
you know, he'd ask me
if he could see her.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.229
He'd ask me
if he could talk to her.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.235
I'd tell him, "No."

08:19.977 --> 08:22.502
And after a while...

08:25.592 --> 08:28.682
Well, he just stopped asking.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.168
I mean, I thought
I was protecting Mike

08:37.168 --> 08:40.694
by treating her
like she didn't exist.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.655
But now I don't know.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.224
Yeah.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.443
When Courtney's father
came to Blue Valley,

08:51.443 --> 08:54.359
I blamed myself
for the hurt it caused her.

08:57.624 --> 09:01.628
But I do think she got
some closure from it.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.630
Made her stronger.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.501
Made us stronger.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.723
And in no small part
thanks to you.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.945
Sometimes letting our kids
face the pain

09:14.945 --> 09:19.820
is the only way to help them
learn how to cope with it.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.869
Maybe Mike needs
to see his mom again.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.574
I don't know.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.012
You know.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.585
I knew your parents
were hard on you,

09:45.585 --> 09:48.065
but I never thought
they'd kick you out.

09:48.065 --> 09:51.634
They assumed the worst,
and I couldn't defend myself.

09:51.634 --> 09:55.725
I can't tell them what I'm
actually out doing every night.

09:55.725 --> 09:59.773
They wouldn't understand
any of what we do.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.689
You don't know that.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.692
I know I can't
trust them, Court.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.824
They'd tell people
about everything

10:07.824 --> 10:11.349
just to try and control me
like they always do.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.268
And this isn't
just about my secret.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.749
It's about yours.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.403
Beth's and Rick's.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.671
I need to apologize
to Rick and Beth too, but...

10:30.760 --> 10:33.894
There's something else
I wanna ask them.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.897
Before I do,

10:36.897 --> 10:38.986
I need your support on it.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.250
What are you talking about?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.693
We should get delivering.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.132
I can't quit my paper route.
My dad would kill me.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.221
We have more important things
to do than deliver papers.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.093
We gotta figure out
who planted those spy cameras

10:59.093 --> 11:00.790
before anyone else does.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.445
We'll win, like,
mega hero points, man.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.882
Your sister and her friends
will find the killer.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.755
Besides, I'm still worried
about Cindy.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.713
Cindy? Are you serious?

11:10.713 --> 11:14.674
Cindy stood up for us,
but we didn't stand up for her.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.677
I guess.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.722
And she's out there alone...

11:19.722 --> 11:21.550
turning into a crocodile.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.727
<i>Ooh, I wonder
if she'll grow a tail.</i>

11:25.989 --> 11:28.731
Okay, so you wanna skip out
on all the glory,

11:28.731 --> 11:30.515
deliver these dumb papers,

11:30.515 --> 11:33.257
and go help Cindy
with her reptile acne?

11:33.257 --> 11:36.304
Maybe the Thunderbolt
could cure her.

11:36.304 --> 11:40.134
Helping Cindy's
the right thing to do...

11:40.134 --> 11:42.310
after we deliver these papers.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.749
All right. All right.
All right. Come on.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.751
Let's do it before
I change my mind.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.363
<i>I have a tail,
and it's pretty useful.</i>

11:52.363 --> 11:53.843
<i>I can use it
to point at things.</i>

11:53.843 --> 11:54.888
<i>I use it to balance.</i>

11:54.888 --> 11:56.803
<i>It is incredibly attractive...</i>

12:36.668 --> 12:38.018
Hi.

12:38.018 --> 12:41.804
I'm not sure you remember me.
I'm Mr. Deisinger.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.200
Cameron's art teacher?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.989
May I come in?

12:58.908 --> 13:01.258
Thank you so much.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.608
I trust your morning
is going well.

13:09.919 --> 13:13.053
This is a wonderful home.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.924
Thank you.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.799
Looks a little
like Cameron's work.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.192
It's his mother's.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.933
I see
where he gets his talent.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.674
Please, sit.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.944
I wanted to talk to you
about Cameron.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.821
I don't know if he's told you,
but he quit art.

13:41.821 --> 13:46.390
Yes. He has other things
he's interested in now.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.609
But why?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.395
He has such passion for it.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.139
I know
losing his father was hard--

13:56.139 --> 13:58.098
You know nothing.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.578
Lily, please.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.714
I'm sorry.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.108
I only came
to express my concern.

14:09.761 --> 14:13.853
Cameron's walking away from
something I know that he loves.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.768
It makes him happy.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.727
I've dreamt about it.

14:21.121 --> 14:25.821
I can't stand by and watch him
throw his artistic life away.

14:27.910 --> 14:28.911
I won't.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.662
Lily...

15:03.424 --> 15:06.514
It doesn't matter
what that man said now.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.386
He's dead.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.951
Hey, bud.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.082
Crock.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.866
Wanted to check in,
seeing as how

15:54.866 --> 15:57.521
me and the missus were
being spied on just like you.

15:57.521 --> 16:00.002
Gotta catch these peepers.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.743
Be a relief to be cut loose

16:01.743 --> 16:04.354
after being on a leash
for so long.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.661
Hey, where's Pemberton?

16:06.661 --> 16:09.185
Beth tracked the feed
to a mine in Utah.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.231
Sylvester went to check it out.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.797
What are you doing?

16:14.147 --> 16:16.323
Looking for someone.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.066
Hold on. Sylvester?

16:20.066 --> 16:21.545
<i>Hey, Pat.</i>

16:21.545 --> 16:23.983
- How's the search going? <i>
- Terrible.</i>

16:23.983 --> 16:26.115
<i>Hit another dead end.
Beth thinks the signal...</i>

16:26.115 --> 16:27.682
- What is this? <i>
- Is being masked.</i>

16:27.682 --> 16:29.162
<i>It's bouncing
all over the place.</i>

16:29.162 --> 16:30.641
- I'm sorry. <i>
- Unless she locks</i>

16:30.641 --> 16:33.122
<i>onto another lead,
I'm headed back.</i>

16:33.122 --> 16:35.342
Copy that. Be careful.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.083
<i>See you in a few hours.</i>

16:38.475 --> 16:40.608
So who are <i>you</i> looking for?

16:42.131 --> 16:45.221
Mike's mom.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.702
Why are you Googling the ex?

16:49.486 --> 16:51.314
Trying to figure out
if she's in any shape

16:51.314 --> 16:53.969
to talk to him.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.276
It's kind of a long story.

16:56.276 --> 17:00.149
So let's hear it.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.369
Hey, Crock, and no offense,

17:02.369 --> 17:06.155
but it's a little more
complicated than cardio.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.070
But I appreciate it.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.856
Come on, Pat.

17:11.856 --> 17:15.817
You gotta know by now
you can trust me.

17:18.863 --> 17:21.040
So let's talk.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.831
I'm sorry I never told you
about Cameron.

17:29.831 --> 17:33.052
It was never my intention
to put him before you.

17:34.314 --> 17:37.752
Thanks, Courtney.
Apology accepted.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.845
Okay. We're good.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.935
Cool.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.418
Go on, Court.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.898
Is there something else?

17:53.898 --> 17:56.684
Yes.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.164
What is it?

18:01.384 --> 18:03.256
I wanna tell Cameron everything.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.953
What? Why?

18:04.953 --> 18:08.696
Because I can't be with him
if I can't be honest with him

18:08.696 --> 18:09.871
about the JSA,

18:09.871 --> 18:12.874
about his father,
about me being Stargirl.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.922
I'm asking for your support.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.315
No.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.491
You can't keep
doing this, Court.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.189
Every time you share
our secrets,

18:23.189 --> 18:25.408
it makes all of us less safe.

18:26.496 --> 18:29.934
And for that kid,
because you like him?

18:33.286 --> 18:35.375
Don't tell me
that you knew about this.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.291
- Yeah, I did.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.597
Look, I was wrong
about Cindy.

18:40.597 --> 18:43.992
Not completely wrong.
Just a little wrong.

18:43.992 --> 18:47.169
Courtney wants to tell Cameron
about who his dad really was

18:47.169 --> 18:48.997
and why we had to stop him.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.607
He can't spend
the rest of his life

18:50.607 --> 18:52.392
never knowing anyway.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.263
Look, I know
it's going to be hard,

18:54.263 --> 18:57.614
and I know
there's some real risk here,

18:57.614 --> 18:59.225
but once we get through it,

18:59.225 --> 19:02.793
and I have faith we will,

19:02.793 --> 19:04.447
we'll all heal.

19:08.321 --> 19:11.280
I need to tell him the truth.

19:15.632 --> 19:19.070
- Should we vote?
- Don't bother.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.296
You do what you want to do.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.385
I got your back.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.393
I've got everyone's back here,
no matter what.

19:39.613 --> 19:43.399
And you all know that,

19:43.399 --> 19:45.184
because you're my family.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.188
Nothing will ever change that.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.196
But don't say
that I didn't warn you.

20:11.471 --> 20:14.387
No, he's just grabbing
something from his trunk. He'll
be right back.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.957
I don't know
about this, Paula.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.829
I'm gonna start
with the basics.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.048
How to shatter a man's spleen.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.574
Ah.

20:27.574 --> 20:30.011
Violence was never my thing.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.143
Let's call it
self-defense, then.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.015
And in this town
with a voyeuristic killer

20:34.015 --> 20:36.278
still on the loose,
it's important you are ready

20:36.278 --> 20:38.324
for any kind of attack.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.629
Okay.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.548
I appreciate this,
but I'm just not comfortable

20:45.548 --> 20:48.159
learning how to hurt someone.

20:48.159 --> 20:51.685
It's just not me. Sorry.

20:51.685 --> 20:55.384
All right. I understand.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.299
It means a lot,
though, Paula,

20:57.299 --> 20:59.127
you trying to help me do this.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.695
You're a good friend.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.266
What?

21:07.266 --> 21:10.312
No one's ever called me
their friend before.

21:11.444 --> 21:14.098
I'm sure that's not true.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.418
All right.
The coast is clear.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.944
Okay, if you're gonna do it,
do it already.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.600
I wish that Cindy Burman's
locker at Blue Valley High

21:37.600 --> 21:42.213
in Blue Valley,
Nebraska, 68434, USA,

21:42.213 --> 21:46.305
would open... very quietly.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.524
<i>As you wish, my friend.</i>

21:48.524 --> 21:50.396
<i>But I gotta tell you, ethically,</i>

21:50.396 --> 21:52.223
<i>this puts us in a gray area.</i>

21:52.223 --> 21:54.225
<i>See, I know that you're
technically investigating</i>

21:54.225 --> 21:57.316
<i>this girl under the promise
that she might be a bad guy,</i>

21:57.316 --> 21:59.100
<i>but also, it looks like
breaking and entering</i>

21:59.100 --> 22:00.623
<i>of a girl
that you have a crush on,</i>

22:00.623 --> 22:02.582
<i>so this could
be considered stalking.</i>

22:10.590 --> 22:12.722
A hairbrush.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.942
Who keeps metal cleaner
in their locker?

22:14.942 --> 22:17.858
<i>Oh, a girl
with a giant knife in her arm.</i>

22:17.858 --> 22:19.381
I don't see anything

22:19.381 --> 22:22.253
that's gonna help us
find Cindy.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.864
Why don't you just wish
to know where she is?

22:23.864 --> 22:25.300
- Because I--
- We already wished for that

22:25.300 --> 22:26.693
when we were trying
to recruit her.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.390
Yeah. <i>
- I know I say this a lot.</i>

22:28.390 --> 22:30.392
<i>You can't wish
for the same thing twice.</i>

22:30.392 --> 22:32.133
Don't I know it.

22:32.133 --> 22:35.005
<i>It doesn't smell good
in here, does it?</i>

22:35.005 --> 22:37.791
It kind of smells terrible.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.836
- What's that? <i>
- Put me back in your pocket.</i>

22:39.836 --> 22:42.230
It looks like list
of her father's laboratories.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.450
The ones
that Sebastian checked out?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.277
I think
she checked them out too.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.540
They're all crossed off.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.717
Except one,
the Etter Produce Farm.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.588
It's circled for some reason.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.460
Well, we need
to find out why.

22:54.460 --> 22:58.551
The Etter Farm...
of all places.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.726
Do you know it?

22:59.726 --> 23:01.380
Mr. Etter used
to sell moonshine

23:01.380 --> 23:03.469
to the seniors in town
before he was busted

23:03.469 --> 23:05.427
by Officer Hardy.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.647
Good Lord,
this is a small town.

23:09.213 --> 23:12.565
Well, it has to be circled
for a reason.

23:12.565 --> 23:16.307
And I got a feeling
that this is it.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.659
This is what?

23:19.659 --> 23:22.618
Our lead, Detective Williams.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.969
<i>Yeah, let's go save
the alligator girl!</i>

24:03.267 --> 24:06.488
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:06.488 --> 24:10.579
Can I come in? We need to talk.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.494
Yeah, sure.

24:32.427 --> 24:33.733
You know,
when this all started,

24:33.733 --> 24:36.257
I thought it was gonna be easy,

24:36.257 --> 24:40.914
you know, knowing the good guys
from the bad guys, but now?

24:40.914 --> 24:42.306
It's like Courtney said.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.265
There's good and bad
in everybody.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.441
Some more than others, though.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.618
Hey, are you okay?

24:49.618 --> 24:51.185
Is it the hourglass?

24:51.185 --> 24:54.536
No, no. It's just a headache.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.408
I'm not so sure, Rick.

24:59.454 --> 25:00.934
What is it?

25:02.675 --> 25:05.721
I've been trying to lock into
the signal from the cameras,

25:05.721 --> 25:07.854
but it's been bouncing
all around the country,

25:07.854 --> 25:09.986
sending Sylvester everywhere.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.422
And?

25:15.992 --> 25:17.559
This could just be
another false lead.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.127
Where is the signal
coming from, Beth?

25:21.389 --> 25:22.521
Beth.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.744
It's coming from inside
the Mahkent house.

25:43.193 --> 25:46.066
I've never noticed
these before.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.721
- What do you think?
- Wow.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.159
My dad collected them.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.685
Every time he went
on one of his business trips,

25:56.685 --> 25:58.948
he'd bring one back for me.

25:58.948 --> 26:01.560
Called them trophies.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.085
Your dad went
on a lot of business trips.

26:07.435 --> 26:10.699
Sometimes I wake up,
and when he's not here,

26:10.699 --> 26:12.745
I think he's on one.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.489
Then I remember.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.495
Cameron,

26:24.495 --> 26:27.281
I wanted to talk to you
about your father.

26:28.238 --> 26:30.501
About what happened to him.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.680
I told you,
I don't know much.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.682
I know he was trying to do
something to help the world,

26:36.682 --> 26:39.075
and he was killed for it.

26:40.816 --> 26:44.777
That's not exactly
what happened.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.736
What are you talking about?

26:48.650 --> 26:52.480
What I'm about to say--
just let me explain it all

26:52.480 --> 26:54.656
before you say anything.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.179
Please.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.575
Okay.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.884
Your father,

27:04.884 --> 27:06.842
he wasn't who you think he was.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.671
- That's enough!
- Lily, no.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.542
What's going on?

27:18.767 --> 27:20.639
I warned you!

27:25.818 --> 27:28.168
You children,

27:28.168 --> 27:32.651
you will finally die
for what you have done.

27:48.231 --> 27:51.757
- Why didn't Rick wait for us?
- He isn't thinking straight.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.455
He messed with the hourglass--
- Explain later.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.722
Just wait here.
- But, Yolanda--

28:00.722 --> 28:02.506
Fighting's not
your thing, Beth.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.951
These creepy old ghouls,

28:11.951 --> 28:13.822
they're the ones
that have been watching us.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.522
Cameron, don't!

28:20.611 --> 28:22.135
Cameron.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.832
We need to get outta here.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.355
No, that's Rick.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.314
Rick.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.707
Rick, stop!

28:37.193 --> 28:38.891
Enough!

28:59.999 --> 29:00.913
Oh.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.655
<i>- Hey, Beth.</i>
- Dad?

29:04.655 --> 29:07.833
Dad, this is a bad time.
How did you even call me?

29:07.833 --> 29:10.661
<i>From a different number.
Burner phone.</i>

29:10.661 --> 29:12.707
Leave us be.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.716
<i>- What's that sound?</i>
- Bad guys.

29:55.358 --> 29:57.752
<i>- Beth, listen to me.</i>
- Dad, I have to go.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.667
<i>Your mom and I talked
to Dr. McNider.</i>

29:59.667 --> 30:02.409
<i>He told us everything
your goggles and suit can do.</i>

30:02.409 --> 30:04.628
<i>Even the untested programs.</i>

30:04.628 --> 30:06.065
Untested programs?

30:06.065 --> 30:07.762
<i>Beth, you gotta activate
combat mode.</i>

30:07.762 --> 30:11.026
- Combat mode? <i>
- Combat mode activated.</i>

30:11.026 --> 30:12.462
<i>Beta trial.</i>

30:13.899 --> 30:16.031
<i>Attack imminent.</i>

30:16.031 --> 30:17.380
- What? <i>
- Take cover.</i>

30:18.642 --> 30:21.080
Get out.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.952
<i>Duck. Roll.</i>

30:26.259 --> 30:29.262
<i>Select fighting style.</i>

30:29.262 --> 30:31.090
Whoa. Combat mode.

30:31.090 --> 30:33.092
<i>Headshot incoming.</i>

30:33.092 --> 30:34.310
<i>Left hook.</i>

30:35.921 --> 30:37.879
Sorry.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.750
<i>Activate cape shield.</i>

31:00.032 --> 31:01.511
Rick, stop!

31:42.683 --> 31:45.381
Old people. Ugh! Gross.

31:57.089 --> 31:58.525
Hold on, Chapel.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.050
Let's go, nerd.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.196
Rick, let him go!

34:00.081 --> 34:01.169
Cameron.

34:03.258 --> 34:05.565
They killed your father.

34:08.872 --> 34:11.962
Cameron, I...

34:27.891 --> 34:29.328
Do it!

34:32.940 --> 34:34.115
Yes.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.687
Do it!

34:40.687 --> 34:42.863
Yes.

34:42.863 --> 34:45.344
Cameron, stop.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.609
This hate

34:49.609 --> 34:51.872
is what killed your father.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.093
His anger. His grief.

34:55.093 --> 34:58.226
Don't let them take control
of you, Cameron.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.761
Don't ignore... love.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.984
Sofus. Sofus?

35:18.768 --> 35:20.248
Sofus?

35:20.248 --> 35:21.554
Grandpa.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.385
He's having a heart attack.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.430
What do we do?

35:28.430 --> 35:30.171
We call my mom.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.914
<i>- Beth?</i>
- Mom, what do we do?

35:33.914 --> 35:35.394
<i>Okay, honey.
His heart stopped.</i>

35:35.394 --> 35:37.396
<i>- Honey, the gloves.</i>
- What?

35:37.396 --> 35:38.614
<i>The defibrillators, Beth.</i>

35:38.614 --> 35:40.616
<i>They're built into the gloves.</i>

35:40.616 --> 35:42.792
<i>- Your suit will insulate you.
- Get everyone--</i>

35:42.792 --> 35:44.794
Clear.

35:52.802 --> 35:58.330
Sofus.

36:03.509 --> 36:07.165
Sofus.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.837
Court...

36:29.404 --> 36:31.276
I'm sorry.

36:41.895 --> 36:45.420
911, what's your emergency?

37:26.374 --> 37:27.810
It is creepy out here.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.335
<i>Uh, I'm an all-powerful
genie in a pen,</i>

37:30.335 --> 37:31.814
<i>and I'm creeped out.</i>

37:31.814 --> 37:34.121
Yeah. Man up.
You wanna find Cindy?

37:34.121 --> 37:35.427
Let's find Cindy.

37:35.427 --> 37:36.602
Why would
the Dragon King pick

37:36.602 --> 37:38.647
a low-tech farm
for a high-tech lab?

37:38.647 --> 37:40.388
It's where
the main power lines cross

37:40.388 --> 37:43.304
with the main water lines.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.827
Plus it's remote.

37:58.972 --> 38:01.322
Doesn't look like
anyone's home.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.543
Yeah.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.460
Come on. Let's check the back.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.612
We should have
brought a flashlight.

38:30.612 --> 38:33.354
Yeah, well,
you got a living one.

38:33.354 --> 38:36.923
Oh, right. The Thunderbolt.

38:36.923 --> 38:37.924
So cool.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.028
Should we even be doing this?

38:55.028 --> 38:57.509
Like, it's not technically
breaking and entering,

38:57.509 --> 38:58.858
but it is really creepy.

38:58.858 --> 39:00.250
I've seen this as a set piece

39:00.250 --> 39:02.601
for a lot
of independent horror films.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.125
I don't think Cindy Burman
would ever hole up here.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.214
I don't know, Cindy could do
a lot with this place.

39:07.214 --> 39:10.609
Open floor plan, rustic décor.
She could open a B&B.

39:10.609 --> 39:12.088
Yeah, well,
maybe there's, like,

39:12.088 --> 39:13.612
a secret laboratory

39:13.612 --> 39:15.875
underneath it or something.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.268
I don't see
anything but junk.

39:18.268 --> 39:22.925
And a lot of manure.
Like, Biff Tannen level manure.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.977
- Was that you?
- Uh, I don't growl.

39:30.977 --> 39:32.935
That's not my thing.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.375
Uh...

39:37.375 --> 39:39.507
Oh, boy.

39:53.826 --> 39:58.918
I'll kill
every last one of them.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.464
Greg, move your head.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.944
<i>Mad Ghost!</i>
