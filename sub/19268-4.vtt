<i>[4 years ago]
- Where are you?</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.940
I just passed Young Wol.

00:24.940 --> 00:26.120
<i>Honey...</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:27.620
What now?

00:28.440 --> 00:31.420
<i>You heading over there is making me nervous for no reason.</i>

00:31.420 --> 00:33.650
Then, should I just quit and go home?

00:33.650 --> 00:35.660
Do I need to chop off my fingers for you to believe me?

00:35.660 --> 00:37.840
<i>Don't say things like that.</i>

00:37.840 --> 00:39.730
<i>Hang on.</i>

00:39.730 --> 00:41.390
<i>Daddy!</i>

00:41.390 --> 00:42.670
Minji!

00:42.670 --> 00:47.620
I'll be home early tomorrow after work so listen to Mom...

00:47.620 --> 00:48.500
Okay?

00:48.500 --> 00:49.710
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:47.480 --> 01:50.890
Addict

03:14.840 --> 03:16.850
You must want some ice cream.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.120
Minji...

03:44.940 --> 03:46.850
My name is Hyo Jung.

03:54.690 --> 03:58.970
We don't need this!

05:14.200 --> 05:15.260
What?

05:15.260 --> 05:17.570
<i>Hey... go bet for someone.</i>

05:17.570 --> 05:19.280
I told you I'm resting today.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.550
Shut up and hurry.
I'm in a rush.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.240
I think they'll give us some.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.600
<i>Fine, I can get someone else.</i>

05:29.610 --> 05:30.830
What time?

05:30.830 --> 05:34.030
You little... trying to play hard to get.

05:34.030 --> 05:35.860
I'll give you the address, write it down.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.550
What address.

05:37.550 --> 05:39.000
<i>They told us to go to their house.</i>

06:08.690 --> 06:10.030
<i>Who is it?</i>

06:13.160 --> 06:15.500
Did you call for someone?

06:29.730 --> 06:31.590
Mrs. Kwon!

06:32.120 --> 06:34.030
Mrs. Kwon!

06:34.030 --> 06:36.430
Did she forget about morning prayer?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.570
Why is it open?

06:38.570 --> 06:41.530
Mrs. Kwon! Are you home?

07:13.700 --> 07:15.170
<i>Detective Baek.</i>

07:15.170 --> 07:16.280
<i>Come back.</i>

07:16.280 --> 07:18.250
<Quick Mover>
I'm tired of it...

07:18.250 --> 07:20.450
I'm tired of the smell of blood.

07:20.450 --> 07:23.960
I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself in Seoul.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.940
This matches me anyway.

08:12.470 --> 08:13.360
You're a girl?

08:14.010 --> 08:15.780
You can't tell?

08:17.230 --> 08:18.270
You're a student here?

08:18.270 --> 08:19.800
Junior Class, Room 3.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.760
Oh, sorry...

08:25.400 --> 08:27.050
Sorry, sorry...

08:32.320 --> 08:33.250
What?

08:33.250 --> 08:34.510
<i>An entire family has been murdered.</i>

08:34.510 --> 08:37.510
So what?
Call Flounder.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.760
<i>Senior, you remember Kang Jong Yoon, right?</i>

08:42.270 --> 08:45.620
<i>An entire family was found murdered at Kang Won Do...</i>

08:45.620 --> 08:48.710
<i>...Jung Sun Goon, Shin Won Ri this afternoon.</i>

08:48.710 --> 08:52.650
<i>Mr. Lim, who was murdered the night before, had called Mr. Kang...</i>

08:52.650 --> 08:55.420
<i>...to help place a bet, based on the statements.</i>

08:55.420 --> 08:59.960
<i>Kang killed the family and robbed their house.</i>

08:59.960 --> 09:02.330
<i>The police are currently looking for the fleeing suspect.</i>

09:02.330 --> 09:07.830
<i>Meanwhile, Kang, who stole 2 billion dollars at a casino 4 years ago...</i>

09:07.830 --> 09:11.090
<i>...was last seen wandering around the venues-</i>

09:15.500 --> 09:16.930
- Hey!
- Senior!

09:16.930 --> 09:17.950
Are you sure it's Kang Jong Yoon?

09:17.950 --> 09:19.350
Yes.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.960
Mr. Park had called him into this house the night before the crime.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.510
And we confirmed his face with the witness.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.940
Nothing's changed.

09:33.650 --> 09:35.070
This way.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.110
What's wrong with her teeth?

09:58.010 --> 09:58.770
Did she get hit?

09:58.770 --> 10:01.500
You can't break teeth without injuring the mouth.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.240
I think the victim bit something.

10:04.590 --> 10:06.030
He escaped this way.

10:12.690 --> 10:13.820
Victim's identity?

10:14.190 --> 10:15.960
He was a loan shark by the name of Im Do Sool.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.420
It looks like he took all the cash that was in the house.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.780
But, they're looking into the exact amount.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.480
What's our radius search?

10:24.480 --> 10:25.820
20 km.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.310
Make it 40.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.150
Why?

10:31.030 --> 10:33.020
You were in the Army Reserves.
You wouldn't know...

10:33.060 --> 10:35.060
This bastard was in the Marines Special Forces.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.150
Did you send someone over to his house?

10:39.120 --> 10:40.300
H-house?

10:45.280 --> 10:46.970
How long have you been doing this?

10:49.020 --> 10:50.340
Gwang Pal!

10:51.030 --> 10:52.780
Let me ask a favor!

10:56.500 --> 10:59.360
He took his cash, jewels, everything and split.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.160
Bank account?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.470
<i>Clean.</i>

11:01.470 --> 11:05.090
He must have been in a rush,
even leaving the dish soap!

11:05.090 --> 11:06.940
Okay. Thank you.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.070
That means he was on the same page.

11:25.090 --> 11:26.730
Everything is set, right?

11:26.730 --> 11:28.960
Who do you think I am?

11:28.960 --> 11:31.310
I told them to call as soon as they see a suspicious guy.

11:31.310 --> 11:33.480
I already told all the merchant ships.

11:34.270 --> 11:37.170
But, is he really coming here?

11:38.410 --> 11:40.570
The thing about gambling addicts...

11:40.570 --> 11:43.180
Instead of killing people...

11:43.180 --> 11:46.280
They care more about gambling.
That's the scary thing.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.400
Their heads go crazy if they think they can't gamble again.

11:49.520 --> 11:54.250
Sooner or later, his wife will be here to bring him money.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.040
This is the only place he can keep gambling.

11:59.340 --> 12:03.700
Is this the bastard I'm thinking of?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.740
The one who screwed you over!

12:08.740 --> 12:11.790
No wonder you're so into it!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.680
If I hear that he smuggled out...

12:19.680 --> 12:21.430
You know what'll happen, right?

12:29.280 --> 12:29.890
What?

12:29.890 --> 12:32.010
<i>Senior! We found Kang Jong Yoon's cellphone!</i>

12:32.010 --> 12:32.740
Where?

12:32.740 --> 12:33.780
Young Wol Terminal.

12:33.780 --> 12:34.930
Young Wol?

12:35.730 --> 12:37.200
Young Wol is in the opposite direction!

12:37.200 --> 12:39.900
Is this another mess up?

13:14.280 --> 13:15.030
What?

13:15.030 --> 13:15.960
Senior!

13:15.960 --> 13:17.740
<i>Kang Jong Yoon is inside a bus right now.</i>

13:17.740 --> 13:19.430
<i>He'll be arriving in Won Ju at 1:30.</i>

13:19.430 --> 13:20.530
Won Ju?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.440
Sorry! Sorry!

13:32.440 --> 13:34.090
Hey Baldie! You wanna die?!

13:34.090 --> 13:34.950
Baldie?

13:34.950 --> 13:37.500
Okay! Sorry!

14:01.980 --> 14:04.310
Sorry. Sorry.
This is the police.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.860
Wait! Wait!

14:58.630 --> 15:01.270
<i>Senior! Now!
He turned his phone on!</i>

15:09.960 --> 15:11.790
What are you doing?!

15:11.790 --> 15:13.890
Stay still.
I'll break your arm.

15:13.890 --> 15:15.260
Save me!

15:20.830 --> 15:21.870
Who are you?

15:22.760 --> 15:25.240
I only took $30!

15:25.240 --> 15:28.210
I just needed to make a call once I got here.

15:34.910 --> 15:35.840
What?

15:35.840 --> 15:38.560
<i>We sighted Kang Jong Yoon not too long ago.</i>

15:38.560 --> 15:40.360
What? Where?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.870
He was in... Jung Sun.

15:42.870 --> 15:44.140
Jung Sun?

17:37.660 --> 17:40.400
I really thought that was him.

17:42.530 --> 17:46.520
What kind of crazy man would do that so close to the police station?

17:49.550 --> 17:50.810
What's that?

17:51.580 --> 17:54.940
Im Min Sub, the victim's brother.

17:55.910 --> 17:57.380
Send him off.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.420
Yes.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.180
Excuse me.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.060
You can go back now.
You can't stay here.

18:04.060 --> 18:05.570
We'll contact you later.

18:06.220 --> 18:07.710
Bye.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.540
That's a great photo.

18:32.230 --> 18:34.090
Did you forget that we have a hearing next week?

18:34.720 --> 18:37.180
The Boss decided he wants to be involved.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.460
Regional Unit.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.240
What have you been doing not taking the lead?

18:43.240 --> 18:44.640
I'm sorry.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.970
If you give us a week-

18:45.970 --> 18:47.430
Give us 3 days.

18:57.120 --> 19:01.060
Because he was caught red-handed...

19:01.060 --> 19:03.980
They're wondering how fast we can catch him...

19:03.980 --> 19:05.810
This case is hard as hell but there'll be no reward for catching him.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.460
Is it because of Detective Baek?

19:09.430 --> 19:13.560
The way he murdered the family members still doesn't make sense.

19:15.350 --> 19:16.950
Anyway...

19:16.950 --> 19:21.270
When his kid grows up, this crime will be the most painful for her.

19:21.270 --> 19:26.630
What could be more painful than watching the person you love kill someone?

19:31.130 --> 19:33.300
I shouldn't have said that.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.300
It's fine.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.960
It's more painful to have forgotten the pain.

19:56.890 --> 20:01.530
I can't believe that he was over Jung Sun and didn't run farther away.

20:01.530 --> 20:04.110
What in the world could've gotten into him?

20:12.020 --> 20:13.320
Did Kang Jong Yoon show up?

20:13.320 --> 20:14.750
No!

20:16.280 --> 20:18.080
Then why did you call?

20:18.080 --> 20:22.070
Somebody else came looking for him...

20:22.070 --> 20:23.010
Who was it?

20:23.010 --> 20:25.660
A rough looking guy.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.140
<i>I thought maybe just in case.</i>

20:27.140 --> 20:28.610
Go ahead and write this down.

20:28.610 --> 20:32.760
Silver Grandeur, license number 9881.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.010
Okay.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.640
Search for a Silver Grandeur, license number 9881.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.430
Fine.

20:53.490 --> 20:54.700
Wait.

20:59.220 --> 21:01.750
Go back a little.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.000
Stop.

21:11.660 --> 21:13.470
That's Bong Yang, right?

21:13.470 --> 21:14.290
Yes.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.190
He went inside at 1:22...

21:19.520 --> 21:21.360
...and came out at 1:45.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.200
2 minutes, 57 seconds.

22:13.410 --> 22:16.910
If that took 3 minutes, then that means he was here for 20.

22:19.160 --> 22:22.010
What did that bastard do here?

22:23.940 --> 22:25.600
Where could he have gone?

22:31.160 --> 22:32.700
Have you seen this man?

22:34.160 --> 22:36.150
I've never seen him.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.000
Mrs.!

22:45.000 --> 22:46.880
Have you seen this person by any chance?

22:46.880 --> 22:48.410
I'm not a Mrs.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.230
Sorry to bother you but have you seen this person?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.110
I've never seen him.

22:56.110 --> 22:57.320
I'm not sure...

23:22.820 --> 23:25.840
I thought I told you that I've never seen him.

23:40.930 --> 23:42.820
You little...

23:52.010 --> 23:53.110
Found it!

24:11.600 --> 24:14.600
I was hesitant at first.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.650
What can you do for me for $500?

24:24.650 --> 24:29.690
In this economy, the question is what can't I do for you.

24:31.060 --> 24:32.350
If...

24:32.350 --> 24:34.840
I wanted to look for someone.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.940
I'm not sure...

24:37.260 --> 24:41.460
I have to renew my contract next month...

24:57.050 --> 25:02.060
I can even look for a stray dog that ran away 10 years ago for you.

25:02.060 --> 25:04.420
Let's see... who are you looking for?

25:10.230 --> 25:12.400
A guy who wants to kill Im Do Sool.

25:16.590 --> 25:19.420
A guy that wants to kill Im Do Sool?

25:22.360 --> 25:24.630
I took the money.

25:25.670 --> 25:26.970
But isn't it funny?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.760
Why was he looking when he's the one who killed him?

25:38.080 --> 25:39.790
What was the suspect's specialty?

25:40.550 --> 25:42.020
Marine.

25:42.020 --> 25:43.750
Do you see something strange?

25:43.750 --> 25:46.300
He stabbed him in the chest 8 times...

25:46.300 --> 25:49.260
But, he completely avoided the body's pressure points.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.250
Could it be a coincidence?

25:52.250 --> 25:55.360
It could be... but there's very little chance of that.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.680
The deepest wound was on the left side of the neck.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.250
This is the only time he stabbed at a pressure point.

26:02.170 --> 26:04.120
He must be a pro.

26:04.120 --> 26:08.980
We found a fiber sample on his neck that matched the daughter's outfit.

26:09.680 --> 26:14.820
He must've killed the daughter first and then the father.

26:18.890 --> 26:21.290
When do you think the wife was killed?

26:21.290 --> 26:23.770
The autopsy isn't complete yet but looking at the muscle contraction,

26:23.770 --> 26:27.410
she was killed 1-2 hours before the other two.

26:30.110 --> 26:33.140
Wife, daughter, victim.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.060
What?

26:35.060 --> 26:37.060
The order that he killed them.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.120
Did I ever thank you for coming?

26:47.120 --> 26:48.210
You did.

26:55.990 --> 27:00.160
Nam Yeh Ri will stay in Seoul and talk to the suspect's family members.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.800
Is anyone there?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.080
Ah... yes...
Hello.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.020
I'm from the police.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.120
You're Kim Eun Joo's nephew, right?

27:13.180 --> 27:16.640
I've broken ties with those people a long time ago.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.200
But! Wait-

27:19.600 --> 27:21.760
I'm here to ask about Kim Eun Joo.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.600
I'm so tired of this!

27:27.540 --> 27:30.610
I have some questions about Kim Eun Joo-

27:43.100 --> 27:44.140
What?

27:44.140 --> 27:45.760
Who the hell is that?

27:54.590 --> 27:55.820
Hey punk!

27:58.980 --> 28:00.430
Senior.

28:01.570 --> 28:02.890
It's been a year.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.400
What are you doing here?

28:05.810 --> 28:07.520
Well...

28:07.520 --> 28:09.520
This case was given to us.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.610
You know...
From above...

28:16.940 --> 28:18.070
And so...

28:18.740 --> 28:20.730
You came here trying to take on the case?

28:22.150 --> 28:23.170
Yes.

28:27.670 --> 28:29.330
Where's Director Yeo?

28:30.400 --> 28:33.070
Encounter

29:42.520 --> 29:45.750
There are blood stains on the wall but not on the frame.

29:46.870 --> 29:50.240
That means the frame wasn't there during the crime.

29:51.430 --> 29:53.640
You're still the same.
Director Yeo.

29:55.740 --> 29:58.530
For a culprit who left his fingerprints everywhere...

29:58.530 --> 30:02.070
Why would he dare to take the frame off and put it back on?

30:02.070 --> 30:04.600
It probably fell during a fight.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.780
Then, what's the motive?

30:06.780 --> 30:10.920
The only thing missing from the scene is a couple of checks and some cash.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.230
For that, he stabbed three people?

30:14.680 --> 30:15.720
For some reason...

30:16.820 --> 30:20.490
That doesn't fit with this kind of complicated crime scene.

30:20.490 --> 30:22.220
What are you saying?

30:22.220 --> 30:26.850
Sounds like you're saying the culprit might have been framed...

30:28.520 --> 30:32.320
The culprit left Im Do Sool in a not so fatal state...

30:32.320 --> 30:34.720
...and stabbed the wife and daughter first.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.310
Why would he do that?

30:40.780 --> 30:41.810
Pain...

30:45.400 --> 30:49.790
The culprit wanted the victim to watch his family get murdered.

30:49.790 --> 30:53.770
This murder was for revenge.

30:55.610 --> 30:56.670
Director Yeo.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.780
What do you know about Kang Jong Yoon?

31:01.380 --> 31:03.760
I know about the attempted murder case from 3 years ago.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.630
I heard you were in charge back then.

31:06.630 --> 31:08.990
Then, I'm sure you know that it's the same technique.

31:08.990 --> 31:11.350
Kang Jong Yoon is claiming his innocence until the end.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.870
Saying that he only went in because he thought he knew someone...

31:15.870 --> 31:17.060
That it's unfair...

31:17.060 --> 31:19.060
To not let him go to jail...

31:20.210 --> 31:24.040
That he couldn't let his daughter become the daughter of a murderer...

31:24.040 --> 31:26.680
He begged on his hands and knees, that bastard.

31:27.870 --> 31:31.110
Do you know the first thing he did after receiving probation?

31:44.950 --> 31:47.410
Right when I saw those eyes, I knew.

31:47.410 --> 31:51.130
Ah... So this is it.

31:51.130 --> 31:55.030
Gambling addicts will do anything to keep gambling.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.950
Putting on a show to get what they want is nothing to them.

31:59.950 --> 32:02.210
I won't make the same mistake twice.

32:02.210 --> 32:05.770
You're the one who helped him get out of jail on probation.

32:05.770 --> 32:11.180
Don't tell me they're blaming you for this family's death.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.630
Mixing personal feelings into an investigation...

32:16.630 --> 32:18.980
...is the deadliest thing.

32:21.950 --> 32:23.400
Personal feelings?

32:25.940 --> 32:27.760
Look who's talking, Director Yeo.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.770
You said this was for revenge, didn't you?

32:32.170 --> 32:33.510
Ah...

32:34.330 --> 32:36.130
Because revenge is your specialty.

32:38.850 --> 32:40.730
Isn't that why you're known for?

32:43.960 --> 32:48.070
In this territory, there are a lot of things you won't understand.

32:48.070 --> 32:52.260
These Detectives are mean and nasty.

32:52.260 --> 32:54.600
They don't like outsiders poking their head in their case.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.600
So leave quietly.

33:07.530 --> 33:10.320
Come in.
2nd floor.

33:11.780 --> 33:15.200
Did she have any close friends?

33:15.200 --> 33:18.580
No! Only debt collectors.

33:18.580 --> 33:22.860
What are these numbers?

33:23.720 --> 33:25.900
She's so strange.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.580
Her daughter is old enough to know her numbers.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.380
I don't know why she wrote these numbers on the stairs.

33:43.010 --> 33:48.440
No usage of the transportation card or call history after the crime...

33:51.310 --> 33:53.910
She didn't meet anyone either...

33:59.700 --> 34:03.890
Where could she have gone with her child?

34:37.469 --> 34:39.290
These are all new.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.600
A man?

36:04.720 --> 36:07.490
This is Yeo Ji Hoon from the Special Affairs Team.

36:07.490 --> 36:11.010
Where is the wine bottle that was at the crime scene?

36:11.010 --> 36:14.260
<i>It's in custody at the NFS for fingerprint verification.</i>

36:14.730 --> 36:17.170
Would you be able to call them and send me a photo?

36:17.170 --> 36:22.020
<i>We have a photo.
But Kang Jong Yoon's fingerprints are very subtle.</i>

36:22.020 --> 36:26.450
I don't need the fingerprints.
I need the label.

36:32.590 --> 36:35.900
Can we at least eat?
I'm starving.

36:35.900 --> 36:39.750
After giving him the orders,
we should be hearing from him soon.

36:39.750 --> 36:44.480
Would he actually be that stupid to act up when the police is around?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.280
He's coming.

37:01.590 --> 37:03.380
You little punk.

37:03.880 --> 37:08.010
How many years has it been and you don't even know anything here.

37:12.830 --> 37:14.210
Let's go.

37:39.580 --> 37:41.350
Cheval Blanc.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.930
Keep watch here.

38:05.930 --> 38:06.780
Yes, Senior.

38:23.270 --> 38:24.160
The account book?

38:24.160 --> 38:27.750
Of course, I brought it.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.880
The rest is in here.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.820
Forget the money.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.720
Min Sub.

39:01.390 --> 39:03.130
All done, right?

39:03.130 --> 39:05.270
I'm leaving first.

39:12.900 --> 39:16.060
What are you still doing here and not running away?

39:16.060 --> 39:18.870
Why... are you doing this?

40:29.230 --> 40:30.500
Stay right there.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.420
Where is Kang Jong Yoon?

40:39.020 --> 40:41.120
I said where is Kang Jong Yoon, you bastard.

40:42.830 --> 40:44.140
There.

41:04.860 --> 41:06.290
Who the hell is this?

41:16.750 --> 41:19.630
Assault, robbery, threat.

41:20.660 --> 41:22.180
Your records are impressive.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.170
I played around when I was a kid.

41:25.460 --> 41:27.320
Is there something wrong with that?

41:27.320 --> 41:28.530
So...

41:29.200 --> 41:32.280
You wanted to catch Kang Jong Yoon yourself?

41:33.030 --> 41:35.540
He murdered my brother's entire family.

41:35.540 --> 41:38.810
If you were me, would you let him get away?

41:41.190 --> 41:44.120
License plate 9881, Silver Grandeur.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.790
Was that you?

41:48.280 --> 41:49.470
Yes.

41:56.020 --> 41:57.790
What did you give him?

41:59.670 --> 42:05.470
If you lie again,
I'll rip your mouth off.

42:07.190 --> 42:09.440
The account book.

42:10.330 --> 42:13.680
Account book...
What account book?

42:13.680 --> 42:17.750
Who else would want to kill a loan shark except people who are in debt?

42:17.750 --> 42:18.720
That's why I made the private-

42:18.720 --> 42:23.240
Whenever you open your mouth,
it's always a lie!

42:23.240 --> 42:26.530
Why would a killer look for someone that could kill him?!

42:26.530 --> 42:29.960
It's true. I just gave him the account book, that's it!

42:37.210 --> 42:40.950
Was Im Do Sool ever threatened before in his life?

42:41.680 --> 42:43.020
Threatened?

42:43.760 --> 42:45.120
Think carefully.

42:45.120 --> 42:49.190
If he ran a pawn shop for gamblers,
I'm sure there were a few people.

42:49.190 --> 42:51.700
What are you saying?

42:51.700 --> 42:54.640
Even though his job was shady,
he lived an honest life!

42:54.640 --> 42:56.000
You motherfuc-

42:57.140 --> 42:58.680
Motherfucker?

42:58.680 --> 42:59.650
Motherfuc-

43:00.800 --> 43:03.910
I can have you rot in jail for disrupting an interrogation.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.500
Watch your language.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.080
Should I feed you prison food?

43:16.360 --> 43:18.140
Director Yeo.

43:24.210 --> 43:26.100
What are you doing?

43:28.080 --> 43:30.960
This is the wine that the criminal drank.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.150
Looking at Im Do Sool's wine collection...

43:33.150 --> 43:35.910
Most of the labels were ridiculously expensive.

43:35.910 --> 43:37.900
Should I say he had vulgar taste?

43:39.260 --> 43:43.050
If he had to choose one wine out of his entire collection...

43:43.680 --> 43:45.060
It would be this one.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.920
1982 Cheval Blanc.

43:51.260 --> 43:55.050
Is it a coincidence that the culprit chose to drink this specific wine?

43:57.320 --> 43:59.420
You can fool one's eyes.

44:00.150 --> 44:02.460
But you can't fool one's taste.

44:02.460 --> 44:03.830
Taste?

44:04.580 --> 44:06.380
We've been doing this the wrong way.

44:06.980 --> 44:10.030
Kang Jong Yoon isn't the criminal.
He was framed.

44:10.030 --> 44:12.090
And he's looking for the real killer right now.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.680
The one wanting revenge against Im Do Sool...

44:16.690 --> 44:19.200
The one who likes Cheval Blanc...

44:20.670 --> 44:21.950
Wait.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.930
So...

44:23.930 --> 44:28.580
So you're saying it wasn't that gambler but someone else?

44:32.730 --> 44:35.420
Kang Jong Yoon is finding the real killer?

44:40.390 --> 44:44.390
Whether it's Cheval or bullshit or whatever-

44:44.390 --> 44:47.270
My taste is soju so I'll go my own way.

44:48.130 --> 44:54.400
While you write your novel, I'll be investigating the medical facilities.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.820
Kang Jong Yoon is calling!

45:02.270 --> 45:04.070
He wants to talk to the Detective in charge.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.980
Kang Jong Yoon is calling!

46:55.980 --> 46:57.860
He wants to talk to the Detective in charge.

47:15.870 --> 47:18.230
This is Yeo Ji Hoon from the Special Affairs Team.

47:18.230 --> 47:20.050
<i>It's him!
The bastard who called me!</i>

47:21.300 --> 47:23.980
I thought that bastard was dead.

47:23.980 --> 47:27.120
<i>The man I met that night wasn't Im Do Sool!</i>

47:27.880 --> 47:29.260
Kang Jong Yoon.

47:29.260 --> 47:31.360
Right now, you're wanted as the prime suspect.

47:32.270 --> 47:34.120
If you want to prove your innocence, come to the station-

47:34.120 --> 47:36.980
You don't think I know that you'll just arrest me?

47:37.890 --> 47:40.110
I'm telling you that the bastard framed me!

47:44.420 --> 47:46.880
I'll record this conversation so tell me in detail.

47:51.420 --> 47:53.020
Okay.

47:53.020 --> 47:53.990
Start.

47:55.100 --> 47:57.110
<i>I went to the house...</i>

47:58.300 --> 48:00.460
<i>That bastard let me in...</i>

48:00.460 --> 48:03.060
<i>I thought it was his house.</i>

48:06.560 --> 48:09.350
Good work today.
Have a seat.

48:19.100 --> 48:20.660
Have a drink.

48:24.590 --> 48:25.870
Thank you.

48:37.130 --> 48:39.680
Did you bring what I asked for?

48:40.590 --> 48:41.980
Ah, yes.

48:43.530 --> 48:45.350
I couldn't find the brand you were looking for.

48:53.150 --> 48:55.340
The frame fell.

48:55.340 --> 48:57.350
My daughter likes to play around.

48:57.350 --> 48:59.250
I'm sure you know how 4 year olds can get.

48:59.250 --> 49:01.370
Tell me about your family.

49:01.370 --> 49:03.320
Do I really need to say?

49:03.320 --> 49:05.890
You don't have to if you don't want to.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.410
Can I have another drink?

49:26.220 --> 49:28.640
Today is my daughter's birthday.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.880
The last time I saw her was when she was two.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.610
She should be 6 now.

49:33.590 --> 49:36.530
You should at least call.

49:37.950 --> 49:40.490
I've given up on seeing her in real life.

49:41.310 --> 49:44.050
When I think about her and my wife...

49:44.900 --> 49:47.170
Someone like me should die.

49:47.170 --> 49:49.220
We should go to hell.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.780
I should've cut my wrists back then.

49:54.340 --> 49:56.340
There's no point in cutting your wrists.

49:57.650 --> 49:59.860
If you're going to cut them, you should cut them here.

50:16.740 --> 50:20.270
If I hire you for 2 days, is 7 enough?

50:20.270 --> 50:21.650
That's plenty.

50:21.650 --> 50:24.440
I initially invested in one week.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.390
But something came up.

50:40.140 --> 50:43.040
This is for tip.

50:49.550 --> 50:55.380
After waiting outside the casino for hours, I went back.

50:55.380 --> 50:57.570
They were already dead.

50:57.570 --> 50:59.880
Any witnesses or alibi?

50:59.880 --> 51:01.420
Anyone you met?

51:01.420 --> 51:03.170
Nobody.

51:04.320 --> 51:05.830
I don't know.

51:06.460 --> 51:08.320
Hey Kang Jong Yoon!

51:08.320 --> 51:11.150
If you already got the money,
why did you go back?

51:11.150 --> 51:12.490
Especially at dawn?!

51:12.490 --> 51:14.910
Why don't you come here and draw the montage then, you bastard?!

51:14.910 --> 51:16.640
<i>That-</i>

51:16.640 --> 51:18.240
<i>It was too dark so I couldn't see him.</i>

51:18.240 --> 51:19.950
Stop lying, you bastard!

51:23.110 --> 51:24.380
That crazy bastard.

51:24.380 --> 51:27.110
Trying to act like he didn't see him!

51:30.040 --> 51:32.340
Senior! We were able to track his phone.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.710
You stay here.
Everyone go go!

51:45.890 --> 51:49.160
The perfect scenario to frame someone...

51:50.890 --> 51:52.710
Too cruel...

51:54.000 --> 51:55.930
Too precise...

52:13.760 --> 52:15.970
After a fake phone call...

52:21.790 --> 52:24.150
You even leave a photo?

52:28.230 --> 52:30.570
Kang Jong Yoon, you bastard.

52:32.760 --> 52:36.160
Monster vs. Viper

52:58.030 --> 52:59.630
Don't make a sound.

53:01.590 --> 53:08.470
We try to create a happy lifestyle for the families of gambling addicts.

53:08.470 --> 53:11.410
We encourage them to wear nice clothes and makeup.

53:11.410 --> 53:14.290
We want them to feel attractive.

53:14.290 --> 53:17.640
Because of that,
we often get misunderstandings.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.210
Ah... that's...

53:24.210 --> 53:28.170
Those are the steps that we encourage them to follow.

53:29.340 --> 53:32.930
Kim Eunjoo took them very seriously.

53:32.930 --> 53:35.000
12 steps?

53:41.340 --> 53:45.190
We recommended that they write it down on stairs.

53:45.190 --> 53:46.980
So that every time they walked down...

53:46.980 --> 53:51.330
They would be able to take in good words of encouragement.

53:54.780 --> 53:56.950
Rule #1.

53:56.950 --> 54:00.600
Let's acknowledge the fact that we live with a gambling addict.

54:03.630 --> 54:05.190
Rule #2.

54:06.330 --> 54:08.750
Let's not blame them.

54:16.380 --> 54:17.860
Rule #3.

54:19.180 --> 54:23.070
Let's accept the fact that the past is the past.

54:26.140 --> 54:27.240
Rule #4.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.270
Let's not give up.

54:31.410 --> 54:32.930
Let's not give up.

54:39.410 --> 54:41.160
Let's not give up.

54:42.270 --> 54:44.360
Let's not give up.

54:49.840 --> 54:52.020
She wasn't having an affair.

54:52.710 --> 54:55.960
Wearing makeup...
to be able to smile again...

54:55.960 --> 54:58.810
She did this to remind herself never to give up.

55:00.040 --> 55:04.020
While hoping for her husband to return...

55:43.200 --> 55:47.500
I thought he was just cruel but he's precise too.

55:50.070 --> 55:53.730
Setting everything up in such a short period of time...

55:53.730 --> 55:56.370
This punk is sleek.

55:56.370 --> 55:59.630
What kind of show is he going to put up next time?

56:00.840 --> 56:02.550
Senior! But...

56:02.550 --> 56:08.840
Doesn't it seem strange that he would do all that for money?

56:10.600 --> 56:12.240
Like the Seoul team said...

56:12.240 --> 56:15.850
Maybe it has to do with money and revenge?

56:18.100 --> 56:20.580
You're starting to sound like the Seoul team.

56:21.670 --> 56:25.190
Is that a crime scene or a next door gathering?

56:25.190 --> 56:27.190
Why is the whole world in there?

56:27.810 --> 56:30.010
Why are you hitting me?

56:30.010 --> 56:33.990
Maybe they went there because they're family of the deceased.

56:33.990 --> 56:35.010
Wait.

56:39.010 --> 56:40.870
Isn't there something weird about that bastard?

56:41.530 --> 56:42.550
What?

56:47.030 --> 56:49.950
For someone who wants revenge for his brother...

56:49.950 --> 56:52.520
After seeing the body,
he's not interested at all.

56:54.530 --> 56:56.910
There's something fishy about him.

56:58.290 --> 56:59.590
Watch over this.

57:00.110 --> 57:01.640
Where are you going?

57:13.970 --> 57:16.500
There were no extra copies of the account book.

57:16.500 --> 57:19.630
It'll take some time for us to search everyone on the list.

57:21.430 --> 57:24.820
There's a book by Dostoevsky called, "Crime & Punishment."

57:24.820 --> 57:26.710
It's an interesting title.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.050
Crime and punishment...

57:29.360 --> 57:34.140
The context is a loan shark and daughter are killed with an ax.

57:35.310 --> 57:40.910
That kind of educational book isn't really meant for loan sharks.

58:17.260 --> 58:18.360
Director!

58:18.360 --> 58:21.540
You said that this case was an act of revenge, right?

58:21.540 --> 58:23.790
After looking into Im Do Sool's medical records...

58:23.790 --> 58:25.630
Something interesting came up.

58:25.630 --> 58:28.220
Im Do Sool got treated for syphilis last month.

58:28.220 --> 58:29.190
Syphilis?

58:29.190 --> 58:30.250
Yes.

58:30.250 --> 58:34.280
But a week later, Im Min Sub and Nam Min Jung got the same treatment.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.790
Who's Nam Min Jung?

58:35.790 --> 58:37.340
<i>Im Min Sub's wife.</i>

58:37.890 --> 58:39.380
The brother's wife?

58:40.160 --> 58:41.580
Director.

58:41.580 --> 58:46.320
What if the victim messed with the brother's wife?

58:47.980 --> 58:49.410
Im Min Sub.

58:50.410 --> 58:51.960
Where is he right now?

58:54.970 --> 58:57.780
What did he do here?

59:00.870 --> 59:02.150
What is it?

59:06.690 --> 59:08.520
What did this bastard do?

59:34.250 --> 59:35.620
It's backwards.

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:08.850
5 hundred million!

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.040
5 hundred million inside of this safe?

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.820
Kang Jong Yoon...

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.830
You broke into the safe.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.420
Wait. Then...

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.980
Since the brother was the only other person who knew where the money was...

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.770
The revenge he wanted for his brother...

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.960
Two rats were fighting each other for this money...

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:50.650
What?

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:51.710
Senior!

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:55.030
The Seoul team went to go catch Im Min Sub.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.380
What?

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.410
Why Im Min Sub?

01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:00.360
He's now a suspect for this family murder.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.200
He killed his own brother for sleeping with his wife.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.090
Oh and the Cheval? That thing.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:11.190
<i>That purchase was found in his credit card transactions.</i>

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.500
What the hell are they saying?

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.600
Im Min Sub?

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:17.930
Where is he right now?

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.640
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:51.340
Shut up!

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.570
Who is it?

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.510
Im Min Sub!

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.840
Im Min Sub?

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.270
Im Min Sub!

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.550
What happened?

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.020
Call the ambulance!

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.460
Get it together!

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.230
Im Min Sub...
Who did this?

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:35.930
Kang...

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:40.830
Jong Yoon...

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:22.820
Subtitles by CJ Entertainment

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:26.310
<i>Director Yeo almost feel for it.</i>

01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:28.040
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.740
<i>This is a territory you'll never understand.</i>

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.580
<i>Hell...</i>

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:35.620
<i>Where did he go?</i>

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:40.600
<i>What is he doing for us to keep looking for the criminal?</i>

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.810
<i>I guess there is something difficult for Yeo Ji Hoon.</i>

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:45.340
<i>Come this way.
I have something to show you.</i>

01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:50.110
<i>Kang Jong Yoon is waiting for me...</i>

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.650
<i>Things are just coming together.</i>

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.570
<i>I don't understand why you're doing this.</i>

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:01.610
<i>Like you said, I don't understand why you're doing this either!</i>
