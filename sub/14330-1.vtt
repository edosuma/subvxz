09:31.337 --> 09:33.205
POOF IS TOO YOUNG TO FIGHT.

09:33.272 --> 09:34.640
&gt;&gt; RELAX, WANDA.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.909
HOW TOUGH CAN THIS ANTI-BABY BE?

09:36.976 --> 09:38.544
HE'S A NEWBORN.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.479
[explosion]

09:45.718 --> 09:47.887
A NEWBORN WITH A SUPERSONIC
BABY BOUNCER

09:47.954 --> 09:51.424
FITTED WITH A DEATH RAY!

09:51.490 --> 09:52.758
&gt;&gt; GO!

09:52.825 --> 09:55.061
MY FAKE SMILE AND I
WILL BUY YOU SOME TIME.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.029
&gt;&gt; FINE,
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

09:57.096 --> 10:00.333
WE'RE TAKING POOF TO EARTH,
NOT TEACHING HIM TO FIGHT.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.134
&gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE NO SAFETY.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.937
NOW GO!

10:06.572 --> 10:08.341
&gt;&gt; ATTENTION, FAIRY WORLD,

10:08.407 --> 10:12.278
REVEAL TO ME THE LOCATION
OF THE ONE YOU CALL BABY POOF.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.681
DO SO AT ONCE, OR I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL TERRIBLE OUCHIES.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.483
WAIT.
THAT'S NOT OMINOUS ENOUGH.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.585
&gt;&gt; LISTEN UP, EVIL BABY.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.854
WE WILL NEVER TELL YOU
WHERE POOF IS.

10:21.921 --> 10:22.888
NEVER!

10:22.955 --> 10:24.423
&gt;&gt; FAIRY HART REPORTING LIVE

10:24.490 --> 10:27.426
WHERE JORGEN HAS JUST REFUSED
TO TELL THE EVIL ANTI-BABY

10:27.493 --> 10:30.663
THAT POOF HAS FLED TO EARTH
WITH TIMMY, WANDA, AND KEVIN.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.199
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE.
THIS IS WHY I HATE THE MEDIA.

10:33.265 --> 10:34.667
&gt;&gt; WHO'S KEVIN?

10:34.734 --> 10:35.835
&gt;&gt; AND I AM OFF TO EARTH.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.470
BUT BEFORE I GO,

10:37.536 --> 10:41.240
TAKE THIS, FAIRY WORLD!

10:45.344 --> 10:48.848
boom!

10:50.282 --> 10:52.618
&gt;&gt; I FEEL WEAK AND SAD

10:52.685 --> 10:56.489
LIKE THERE IS A DARK CLOUD
HOVERING OVER MY HEAD.

10:56.555 --> 10:59.992
[crackling]

11:00.059 --> 11:01.193
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

11:01.260 --> 11:05.264
&gt;&gt; FAIRY WORLD,
FEEL MY DIAPER WRATH!

11:05.331 --> 11:07.600
[zapping]

11:07.666 --> 11:12.938
[laughs maniacally]

11:19.678 --> 11:21.414
&gt;&gt; [screams]

11:21.480 --> 11:23.382
MY BEAUTIFUL TAN!

11:26.919 --> 11:27.987
&gt;&gt; HA!

11:28.054 --> 11:30.122
I HAVE DRAINED
TWO MAGICAL WORLDS,

11:30.189 --> 11:31.757
AND ALL BEFORE NAPTIME

11:31.824 --> 11:32.958
WHICH WILL NEVER--

11:33.025 --> 11:34.326
[yawns]

11:34.393 --> 11:35.361
COME!

11:35.428 --> 11:36.429
BUT I'M COMING,

11:36.495 --> 11:38.497
AND I'M COMING FOR YOU, POOF,

11:38.564 --> 11:40.866
AND YOUR FATHER, KEITH, TOO.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.635
[laughs maniacally]

11:42.701 --> 11:45.304
&gt;&gt; JOKE'S ON HIM.
MY NAME'S CARL.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.540
ISN'T IT?

11:51.844 --> 11:54.046
&gt;&gt; [chirps]

11:54.113 --> 11:58.584
&gt;&gt; [grunts nervously]

11:58.651 --> 12:00.753
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT LITTLE MONSTER FOOP

12:00.820 --> 12:02.822
IS COMING FOR OUR BABY.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.623
&gt;&gt; AND POOF IS TERRIFIED TOO.

12:04.690 --> 12:07.126
HE ONLY WELDS WHEN HE'S NERVOUS.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.995
IF ONLY COSMO WERE HERE,
HE'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.530
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE COSMO!

12:11.597 --> 12:13.065
&gt;&gt; OH, REALLY?

12:13.132 --> 12:14.733
THEN WHY DON'T I KNOW
WHAT TO DO?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.168
&gt;&gt; STAY CALM, GUYS,

12:16.235 --> 12:18.070
AND HELP ME GET THIS PLACE
FOOP PROOF.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.271
FACE IT, WANDA.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.207
WE HAVE TO GET POOF READY
FOR A FIGHT.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.541
&gt;&gt; BUT HOW?

12:22.608 --> 12:25.111
SINCE FOOP DRAINED
ALL THE FAIRY WORLD MAGIC,

12:25.177 --> 12:27.913
WE ONLY HAVE THE RESERVE POWER
IN OUR WANDS.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.949
&gt;&gt; A FIGHT?
I'LL BE HIS TRAINER.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.517
BUT FIRST I WANT A HOAGIE.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.520
THAT WON'T USE MUCH MAGIC
AT ALL.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.523
ONLY BIGGER.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.358
WITH MORE BOLOGNA.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.227
ON PUMPERNICKEL.

12:41.293 --> 12:44.430
WITH EXTRA CHEESE.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.998
NO.
A CORNDOG.

12:46.065 --> 12:48.200
JUST A SALAD.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.804
BACK TO THE HOAGIE.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.706
PERFECT.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.108
UM, I'M OUT OF MAGIC, WANDA.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.711
I'M GOING TO NEED TO BORROW
YOUR WAND FOR THE HOAGIE SAUCE.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.213
&gt;&gt; SHH!
POOF IS NAPPING.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.515
&gt;&gt; GOOD.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.718
HE'S GOING TO NEED
ALL THE REST HE CAN GET.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.788
&gt;&gt; OMINOUS THEME MUSIC?

13:09.855 --> 13:11.757
FRESHLY GROOMED
BABY FACIAL HAIR?

13:11.824 --> 13:14.293
THE RUINS OF TWO MAGICAL WORLDS
IN MY WAKE?

13:14.360 --> 13:18.531
THREE, IF YOU INCLUDE
BURGER WORLD.

13:18.597 --> 13:21.534
boom!

13:21.600 --> 13:23.035
THAT'LL TEACH 'EM
TO PUT BABY POOF TOYS

13:23.102 --> 13:27.039
IN THEIR PEPPY MEALS.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.443
&gt;&gt; THINGS ARE LOOKING GRIM
AS FOOP,

13:31.510 --> 13:32.578
THE BAD BOY OF THE BASSINETTE,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.313
SENT ROCKETS EVER CLOSER,

13:34.380 --> 13:37.016
AND POOF, OUR ONLY HOPE,
CONTINUES TO NAP.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.852
&gt;&gt; HOW'D THEY GET THAT FOOTAGE?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.823
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
ALL THE MAGIC WE CAN GET.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.559
WE HAVE TO WAKE UP POOF.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.027
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WAKING THE BABY UP

13:48.093 --> 13:52.331
AS WE LONG AS WE STILL HAVE
THE POWER IN MY WAND.

13:52.398 --> 13:56.068
OH, NO!
IT'S GONE!

13:56.135 --> 13:59.905
[train whistle blows]

13:59.972 --> 14:01.340
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:01.407 --> 14:03.309
&gt;&gt; I GOT NERVOUS THINKING ABOUT
THE EVIL BABY,

14:03.375 --> 14:05.811
SO TO RELAX MYSELF,
I USED YOUR WAND TO POOF UP

14:05.878 --> 14:07.680
THIS HOAGIE-POWERED HAPPY TRAIN!

14:07.746 --> 14:09.882
ALL ABOARD FOR HAPPY TOWN!

14:09.949 --> 14:13.118
[whistle blows]

14:15.187 --> 14:16.655
OOPS.
YOUR WAND IS OUT OF POWER.

14:16.722 --> 14:20.593
AND HAPPY TOWN
IS STILL SO FAR AWAY.

14:20.659 --> 14:23.829
ONLY POOF'S RATTLE CAN GET US
TO HAPPY TOWN NOW.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.065
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING
POOF'S RATTLE.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.167
IT'S THE ONLY MAGIC
WE HAVE LEFT.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.837
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE GOOD NEWS,
WE STILL HAVE SOME TIME.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.874
THE BAD NEWS?
I WAS WRONG.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.944
WE HAVE NO TIME.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.914
&gt;&gt; GREETINGS, PATHETIC
NON-MAGICAL PEOPLE OF EARTH.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.416
FOR GIVING SAFE HARBOR
TO MY NEMESIS,

14:44.483 --> 14:46.852
I SHALL REWARD YOU WITH THE
PLAGUE OF THE MOST EVIL CURSES

14:46.919 --> 14:49.755
EVER CREATED
BY ANTI-FAIRIES.

14:49.822 --> 14:54.793
PAPER CUTS, PINK EYE, SPIDERS,
AND CRAZY COW DISEASE.

14:54.860 --> 14:55.828
[laughs maniacally]

14:55.894 --> 14:59.698
[hiccups]
OH, HICCUPS AGAIN.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.634
zap!

15:06.071 --> 15:07.306
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S ALL THE RUCKUS?

15:07.373 --> 15:08.774
EITHER THE WORLD IS ENDING,

15:08.841 --> 15:11.677
OR THE DINGLEBURGS ARE HAVING
ANOTHER YARD SALE.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.246
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE COWS ALWAYS
CHASING ME?

15:14.313 --> 15:17.816
&gt;&gt; LADYBUGS WITH CAMERAS?
COWS ON POGO STICKS?

15:17.883 --> 15:21.654
HONEY, THE DINGLEBURGS
<i>ARE</i> HAVING A YARD SALE!

15:21.720 --> 15:24.189
&gt;&gt; WHO CARES?
I GOT PINK EYE.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.358
ITCHY, ITCHY PINK EYE.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.894
&gt;&gt; PINK EYE?
WELL, SCRATCH IT.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.229
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T!

15:30.296 --> 15:35.034
I'VE GOT PAPER CUTS.
OUCHY, OUCHY PAPER CUTS.

15:35.100 --> 15:40.472
[screaming]

15:40.539 --> 15:42.708
&gt;&gt; AND NOW, BABY POOF,

15:42.775 --> 15:46.045
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO ROCK YOUR CRADLE!

15:46.111 --> 15:47.446
&gt;&gt; [snoring]

15:47.513 --> 15:50.449
&gt;&gt; POOF, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
WAKE UP!

15:50.516 --> 15:52.318
FOOP IS ALMOST HERE!

15:52.384 --> 15:54.320
&gt;&gt; AND YOUR SELFISH
HOAGIE-HATING MOTHER

15:54.386 --> 15:57.756
USED UP ALL THE MAGIC.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.825
&gt;&gt; THERE.
THAT OUGHT TO KEEP FOOP OUT.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.660
[rumbling]

16:01.727 --> 16:02.628
&gt;&gt; AH!

16:06.532 --> 16:10.969
&gt;&gt; [moos]

16:11.036 --> 16:13.539
&gt;&gt; I'M NEVER DRINKING MILK
AGAIN!

16:13.605 --> 16:16.008
&gt;&gt; HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
YOUNG MAN.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.377
YOU'RE NOT LAYING A FINGER
ON MY BABY.

16:18.444 --> 16:22.047
NOT UNTIL YOU DEAL
WITH BIG MAMA WANDA!

16:22.114 --> 16:23.215
CRANE STANCE!

16:23.282 --> 16:24.283
&gt;&gt; AND...

16:24.350 --> 16:26.785
zap!

16:26.852 --> 16:28.053
WE'RE DONE.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.488
AND NOW, MY GOODY TWO-SHOES
COUNTERPART

16:29.555 --> 16:30.989
WITH A MUCH MORE MASCULINE NAME,

16:31.056 --> 16:33.492
I SHALL FINALLY DESTROY YOU.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.662
I'VE WAITED MY WHOLE LIFE
FOR THIS MOMENT.

16:36.729 --> 16:41.500
ALL 6 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES
OF IT!

16:41.567 --> 16:44.370
WHAT?

16:44.436 --> 16:47.506
&gt;&gt; A-HEM.

16:47.573 --> 16:52.144
POOF POOF!

16:52.211 --> 16:55.681
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE CLEVERER, ROUNDER,
AND MUCH BETTER RESTED THAN I,

16:55.748 --> 16:58.951
BUT YOU'RE STILL NO MATCH
FOR ME!

16:59.017 --> 17:01.120
&gt;&gt; POOF POOF.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.824
&gt;&gt; AH!

17:05.891 --> 17:07.159
A WEDGIE?

17:07.226 --> 17:09.328
ROUND ONE TO YOU,
ROUND ONE.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.262
&gt;&gt; POOF POOF.

17:17.669 --> 17:18.737
&gt;&gt; AH!

17:21.406 --> 17:22.441
COME BACK AND FIGHT.

17:22.508 --> 17:23.541
DON'T BE SUCH A--

17:23.608 --> 17:24.843
[yawns]

17:24.910 --> 17:26.645
BABY!

17:28.947 --> 17:31.483
&gt;&gt; NORMALLY I DON'T ENCOURAGE
VIOLENCE,

17:31.550 --> 17:35.854
BUT KICK HIS LITTLE SQUARE BUTT,
SWEETIE!

17:35.921 --> 17:37.356
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO PLAY?

17:37.423 --> 17:39.658
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE ROMP
IN THE BALL PIT

17:39.725 --> 17:41.860
OF DOOM!

17:43.896 --> 17:44.863
&gt;&gt; POOF POOF?

17:44.930 --> 17:49.001
&gt;&gt; [laughs maniacally]

17:49.067 --> 17:50.035
&gt;&gt; UH-OH.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.004
boom!

17:53.439 --> 17:55.874
&gt;&gt; AND NOW,
WELCOME TO THE TEETER-TOTTER

17:55.941 --> 17:57.843
OF TERROR!

17:57.910 --> 17:59.778
&gt;&gt; POOF POOF!

18:01.180 --> 18:03.982
&gt;&gt; POOF POOF!

18:04.049 --> 18:05.284
&gt;&gt; HM.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.252
IT'S MORE LIKE THE TEETER-TOTTER
OF TEDIUM.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.320
DULY NOTED.

18:08.387 --> 18:11.523
MOVING ON
TO MY MERRY-GO-ROUND

18:11.590 --> 18:13.325
OF MAYHEM!

18:13.392 --> 18:16.028
&gt;&gt; WHEE!

18:16.094 --> 18:18.664
&gt;&gt; HA!
SMELL THE MAYHEM?

18:18.730 --> 18:21.867
CHASING YOU AROUND AND 'ROUND
IN A CIRCULAR MOTION IS SO...

18:21.934 --> 18:23.268
SOOTHING.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.670
PUTTING ME TO...

18:24.736 --> 18:27.072
SLEEP.

18:27.139 --> 18:29.274
&gt;&gt; AHA!

18:29.341 --> 18:31.210
[giggles]

18:31.276 --> 18:32.244
WHEE!

18:32.311 --> 18:33.612
&gt;&gt; WAIT!

18:33.679 --> 18:35.280
YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IN MY SANDBOX
OF SORROW.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.916
THERE'S A SHOVEL OF SADNESS
AND A PAIL OF PAIN.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.855
SO...

18:42.921 --> 18:46.525
SLEEPY.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.695
PERHAPS SOME EVIL THEME MUSIC
WILL INVIGORATE ME.

18:49.761 --> 18:54.233
[pulsating dance music]

18:54.299 --> 18:56.401
[lullaby music]

18:56.468 --> 18:57.469
OH?

18:57.536 --> 19:00.172
AH!
NAPPY TIME TUNES?

19:00.239 --> 19:04.510
NOT INVIGORATING AT ALL.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.744
&gt;&gt; WHERE'S POOF?

19:05.811 --> 19:09.348
&gt;&gt; UP THERE WITH FOOP.

19:09.414 --> 19:10.782
&gt;&gt; HE'S RUNNING AWAY.

19:10.849 --> 19:13.118
I TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING
HE KNOWS.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.654
&gt;&gt; POOF POOF.

19:15.721 --> 19:18.190
&gt;&gt; A SLEEPY TIME MOBILE?

19:18.257 --> 19:19.157
THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN...

19:19.224 --> 19:21.360
[snores]

19:21.426 --> 19:23.195
CURSE YOU, UNICORNS!

19:23.262 --> 19:24.162
DARN YOU, DUCKIES!

19:24.229 --> 19:27.332
I...WILL...NOT...

19:27.399 --> 19:29.001
NAP.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.736
&gt;&gt; POOF'S NOT RUNNING AWAY.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.171
HE'S TIRING FOOP OUT
SO HE'LL FALL ASLEEP.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.940
GUYS, WE'VE GOT TO HELP HIM.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.475
&gt;&gt; WANDA CAN PUT ANYONE
TO SLEEP.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.143
WANDA, QUICK.
START TALKING.

TELL US ABOUT YOUR DAY!

19:39.611 --> 19:42.014
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.851
&gt;&gt; [snores]

19:45.918 --> 19:47.786
&gt;&gt; FAIRY HART HERE
WITH BREAKING NEWS.

19:47.853 --> 19:48.921
I HAVE PINK EYE.

19:48.987 --> 19:50.956
AH!

19:51.023 --> 19:53.191
&gt;&gt; ATTENTION FAIRIES,
ANTI-FAIRIES,

19:53.258 --> 19:55.260
AND BURGER WORLD EMPLOYEES.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.828
POOF NEEDS YOUR HELP.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.097
COME TO DIMMSDALE RIGHT AWAY.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.771
&gt;&gt; TURNER, WE ARE DEPRESSED.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.139
YET WE HEARD YOUR PLEA

20:07.205 --> 20:09.241
AND ARE HERE TO SPANK
SOME BABY BUTT.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.243
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
PUMMEL?

20:11.310 --> 20:13.245
ANNIHILATE?
OBLITERATE?

20:13.312 --> 20:15.514
&gt;&gt; NOPE.
I WANT YOU TO SING.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.515
&gt;&gt; SAY WHAT NOW?

20:16.582 --> 20:18.116
&gt;&gt; POOF'S PUTTING FOOP TO SLEEP.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.954
IF WE ALL SING A LULLABY,
WE CAN FINISH THE JOB.

20:23.689 --> 20:27.492
&gt;&gt; [laughs maniacally]

20:27.559 --> 20:30.529
&gt;&gt; ON THE COUNT OF THREE,
START SINGING A LULLABY.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.532
ONE, TWO, THREE.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.200
all: ♪ GO TO SLEEP ♪

20:35.267 --> 20:36.802
♪ GO TO SLEEP ♪

20:36.868 --> 20:40.072
♪ CLOSE YOUR BIG
BLOODSHOT EYES ♪

20:40.138 --> 20:42.441
&gt;&gt; THE UNIVERSE ISN'T BIG ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.509
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!

20:44.576 --> 20:48.714
SAY, "NIGHT-NIGHT," POOF.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.249
&gt;&gt; NIGHT-NIGHT.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.062
&gt;&gt; WE DID IT.
HE'S ASLEEP.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.198
&gt;&gt; I KNOW HE TRIED
TO DESTROY Y'ALL,

21:06.264 --> 21:07.866
BUT YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

21:07.933 --> 21:12.104
HE'S SO GOSH DARN CUTE
WHEN HE'S A-SLEEPIN'.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.939
&gt;&gt; POOF!
YOU'RE SAFE.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.040
&gt;&gt; POOF POOF.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.274
&gt;&gt; FOOP IS OUT COLD.

21:16.341 --> 21:17.876
HE DRAINED ALL OUR MAGIC.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.112
HOW CAN WE ERASE ALL THE DAMAGE
HE HAS DONE?

21:20.178 --> 21:22.147
&gt;&gt; FOOP'S THE OPPOSITE OF POOF,
RIGHT?

21:22.214 --> 21:24.616
SO IF HE CRIES,
MAYBE GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

21:28.053 --> 21:30.589
&gt;&gt; YOU TOOK MY BA-BA?

21:30.656 --> 21:34.426
I WAS HAVING A SWEET DREAM
ABOUT INTESTINAL PARASITES.

21:34.493 --> 21:37.496
AND YOU WOKE ME UP!

21:37.562 --> 21:44.403
[wails]

21:44.469 --> 21:48.206
&gt;&gt; [cheering]

21:55.914 --> 21:58.050
&gt;&gt; THE MOST GLORIOUS THING
HAS HAPPENED.

21:58.116 --> 21:59.451
&gt;&gt; THE WORLD WAS SAVED?

21:59.518 --> 22:01.353
&gt;&gt; NO.
MY TAN IS BACK!

22:07.859 --> 22:09.861
&gt;&gt; [snores]
WHAT?

22:09.928 --> 22:12.798
I WAS HAVING A WEIRD DREAM
ABOUT INTESTINAL PARASITES.

22:12.864 --> 22:14.099
WHAT DID I MISS?

22:14.166 --> 22:19.871
&gt;&gt; MY SON JUST DEFEATED FOOP
AND SAVED US ALL.

22:19.938 --> 22:21.940
&gt;&gt; HE'S MY SON.
ME.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.942
CALVIN COOLIDGE.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.577
&gt;&gt; THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD,

22:25.644 --> 22:27.279
BUT WHAT THE HECK
ARE WE GOING TO DO

22:27.345 --> 22:28.947
WITH THAT LITTLE MONSTER NOW?

22:29.014 --> 22:31.917
&gt;&gt; I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA.

22:31.983 --> 22:33.852
&gt;&gt; THIS IS FAIRY HART REPORTING.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.454
I NO LONGER HAVE PINK EYE.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.056
IN OTHER NEWS, THE INFAMOUS
BABY FOOP HAS BEEN SENT

22:38.123 --> 22:39.524
TO ABRACATRAZ PRISON

22:39.591 --> 22:45.597
AND PLACED IN THE SAFETY
OF A MAXIMUM SECURITY TIME-OUT.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.933
&gt;&gt; THESE BARS WON'T HOLD ME
FOREVER, CLARICE.

22:47.999 --> 22:50.469
I MEAN, FAIRY HART.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.903
BEWARE, BABY POOF.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.506
