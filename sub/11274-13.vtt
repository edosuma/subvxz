Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.456 --> 00:07.957
Hey, fellas, do me a favor.

00:07.957 --> 00:09.459
You guys have had a few drinks.

00:09.459 --> 00:11.461
Sit down. Let me buy you some coffee.

00:11.461 --> 00:12.462
Aw, th-thanks anyway, Sam,

00:12.462 --> 00:14.214
but everything's under control.

00:14.214 --> 00:16.049
Pete hasn't had a thing
to drink all night.

00:16.549 --> 00:17.550
He's our designated driver.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.053
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
That's a good idea, Pete.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.438
I'm not the designated driver.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.358
I thought you were.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.862
No, no, I-I'm not
the designated driver.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.230
What about you, Mark?

00:30.230 --> 00:32.698
I'm with Sam. I think we
ought to try it sometime.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.703
Wait right here. I'm
gonna call you a cab.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.711
Speaking of driving someone home,

00:44.711 --> 00:47.080
since you've been drinking,
I'd be happy to give you a lift.

00:47.080 --> 00:47.914
Oh, thanks, but, uh,

00:48.415 --> 00:49.916
all I've been drinking is soda water.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.418
Oh.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.803
Well, in that case, Woody,
make me a double martini.

00:56.089 --> 01:00.477
One of us is getting
driven home tonight.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.733
(piano plays)

01:06.733 --> 01:09.235
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:09.235 --> 01:11.237
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:11.237 --> 01:14.240
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:14.240 --> 01:17.243
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:17.243 --> 01:23.116
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:23.116 --> 01:25.952
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:25.952 --> 01:30.957
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:30.957 --> 01:35.962
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:35.962 --> 01:37.964
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:37.964 --> 01:40.467
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:40.467 --> 01:43.970
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:43.970 --> 01:47.474
? You want to go where people know ?

01:47.474 --> 01:50.977
? People are all the same ?

01:50.977 --> 01:54.481
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:14.484 --> 02:15.485
Afternoon, everybody.

02:15.485 --> 02:17.487
ALL: Norm!

02:17.487 --> 02:18.988
How are you today, Mr. Peterson?

02:18.988 --> 02:21.374
Never been better, Woody.

02:21.374 --> 02:24.377
You know, just once
I'd like to be better.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.880
What's the matter there, Normie?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.882
You look a little, uh,
down in the mouth, huh?

02:29.382 --> 02:30.383
I don't know, Cliff.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.253
There's something missing
from my life, I think.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.588
I mean, sure, I got, you know,

02:35.588 --> 02:39.592
the nice wife, uh,
career, a house, but...

02:39.592 --> 02:42.595
I guess I'm talking about
that spiritual something

02:42.595 --> 02:45.398
that can kind of give
it all meaning, you know?

02:45.398 --> 02:46.566
Enable me to be at peace

02:46.566 --> 02:49.519
with myself and the world.

02:49.519 --> 02:52.238
Uh, The Miss Teeny Bikini
Beauty Pageant's on tonight.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.656
Well, that ought to do it.

02:56.109 --> 03:00.113
? Da dum la de da dum... ?

03:00.113 --> 03:04.117
? La de da dum... ?

03:04.117 --> 03:07.120
Oh, isn't it a glorious day?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.621
Well, it sure is, Miss Chambers.

03:08.621 --> 03:12.625
Especially if you like
it cloudy and damp.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.128
Woody, I'm not talking about

03:15.128 --> 03:17.630
superficial things, like the weather.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.133
I'm talking about the day.

03:20.133 --> 03:25.138
Today is going to be the
most special day of my life.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.140
Do you believe in intuition?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.141
No.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.144
But I have this strange
feeling that someday I will.

03:35.064 --> 03:36.065
Hi, guys.

03:36.065 --> 03:38.451
Hey, Sammy!

03:38.451 --> 03:40.370
What's the matter?

03:40.370 --> 03:42.372
You got a weird look on your face.

03:42.372 --> 03:45.792
I don't know if I should tell you.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.793
Well, let me help you out.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.161
Don't.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.632
Well, Sam,

03:52.632 --> 03:54.634
this morning I woke up with

03:54.634 --> 03:56.636
the most overwhelming feeling

03:56.636 --> 03:59.138
that you would propose to me today.

03:59.138 --> 04:02.642
Whew. Talk about fate.
Talk about coincidence.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.143
You have the same feeling?

04:04.143 --> 04:06.646
No, I just wish you'd talk
about fate or coincidence.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.149
Anything but marriage.

04:10.149 --> 04:13.152
Look, I am not gonna
propose to you, Diane.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.021
I know this sounds crazy.

04:15.521 --> 04:19.409
It's not like me to be
given to mystical nonsense,

04:19.409 --> 04:23.663
but the feeling is so strong.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.949
It's an absolute certainty.

04:25.949 --> 04:28.451
Well, if it's fate, it's fate.

04:28.952 --> 04:30.336
Diane,

04:30.336 --> 04:31.671
will you do me the honor of

04:32.171 --> 04:34.674
becoming my
w-w-waitress?

04:34.674 --> 04:36.175
(laughs)

04:38.678 --> 04:41.180
Pretty good, huh?

04:41.180 --> 04:43.182
Sam, will you give me a Cutty rocks?

04:43.182 --> 04:45.184
Did you hear that?

04:45.184 --> 04:47.020
Diane said she woke up

04:47.020 --> 04:49.439
with this feeling that
I'm gonna propose to her.

04:49.439 --> 04:50.940
The stupidest thing I've ever heard.

04:50.940 --> 04:51.941
(loud clank)

04:51.941 --> 04:52.942
Don't ever

04:52.942 --> 04:54.360
make fun of a woman when

04:54.360 --> 04:56.896
she says she has a
feeling about something.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.398
Sammy,

04:58.398 --> 05:00.900
you're tampering with
the psychic world here,

05:00.900 --> 05:02.285
and you're gonna be sorry.

05:02.285 --> 05:03.069
Oh, come on.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.571
No, no, no, I'm serious.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.573
It has to do with a woman's cycle.

05:07.573 --> 05:11.077
See, somehow it's plugged
into the supernatural.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.331
Oh, you're being ridiculous.

05:15.331 --> 05:17.133
No, no, Sammy, please.
Come here. Please.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.135
What? Just promise me

05:19.135 --> 05:20.636
you'll be careful.

05:20.636 --> 05:23.139
Okay, I'll be careful.

05:23.139 --> 05:24.140
Thank you.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.142
Oh, oh, oh, my God!

05:26.142 --> 05:27.643
What? Ooh!

05:27.643 --> 05:28.644
What?

05:28.644 --> 05:30.146
Something's happened to me here. What?

05:30.146 --> 05:32.648
Carla, get Diane over here.

05:32.648 --> 05:35.651
I'm gonna ask her to
marry me... buddy Norm!

05:35.651 --> 05:38.021
(laughs) Oh!

05:38.021 --> 05:39.405
That's twice, man.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.912
Hey, there, Sammy! Today's my big day!

05:45.912 --> 05:46.913
All right, Tom.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.414
Will you marry me?

05:48.915 --> 05:51.284
(laughs)

05:51.284 --> 05:53.703
The results of the last
bar exam are due out,

05:53.703 --> 05:54.704
and I'm feeling lucky.

05:54.704 --> 05:58.207
Hey, you know what they say,
eleventh time's the charm.

05:59.592 --> 06:02.595
Okay, okay, okay, I had a
few problems in the past.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.597
But this time, I really nailed it.

06:04.597 --> 06:07.600
Tell me, Tom, is the
7-11 still giving out

06:07.600 --> 06:10.553
a free Big Gulp with
every, uh, law degree?

06:13.056 --> 06:15.058
Hey, Tom, how come you're not downtown

06:15.058 --> 06:17.060
waiting for the old results, huh?

06:17.060 --> 06:19.562
I got a friend calling me
here when they're posted.

06:19.562 --> 06:22.065
But I got a hunch I did
pretty well this time.

06:22.565 --> 06:24.067
Yeah, like General
Custer had a hunch that

06:24.067 --> 06:26.069
the Little Big Horn was a gift
shop and picnic grounds, huh?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.704
Hey, hey, lay off.

06:28.704 --> 06:30.206
The guy's worked hard.

06:30.206 --> 06:31.707
Woody,

06:31.707 --> 06:33.709
how about a beer for our
future barrister here? Okay?

06:33.709 --> 06:34.911
Thank you, Norm. All right.

06:34.911 --> 06:35.745
So what, uh, what kind of law

06:36.245 --> 06:37.630
are you gonna specialize in there, Tom?

06:37.630 --> 06:38.881
Specialize?

06:38.881 --> 06:41.250
So a free Big Gulp, you say, huh?

06:45.638 --> 06:48.141
Sam, it doesn't have
to be a formal proposal.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.642
Excuse me?

06:49.642 --> 06:52.145
Well, we've already gone
the traditional route,

06:52.145 --> 06:55.148
and I know how you
loathe long sentences.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.150
I know you think I'm
gonna propose to you.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.152
But, trust me, it's not gonna happen.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.654
Before I ask you to marry me, Diane,

07:01.654 --> 07:04.157
there'll be snowflakes
in hell, pigs will fly,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.525
Norm will hate beer...

07:05.525 --> 07:09.412
Hey, everybody, I'm an attorney!

07:11.414 --> 07:12.415
Nah.

07:12.415 --> 07:13.916
(laughs)

07:17.920 --> 07:19.839
TV ANNOUNCER: Thank you,
Barbara G. Bridleton,

07:19.839 --> 07:21.340
Miss Teeny Bikini, South Dakota.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.341
Well, that's it.

07:22.341 --> 07:23.843
I think Miss Arkansas
has got it hands down.

07:23.843 --> 07:24.844
(mutters)

07:24.844 --> 07:26.846
In your hat, Miss Arkansas.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.848
Miss Nebraska's the class of this field.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.349
Oh, yeah, Miss Nebraska.

07:30.349 --> 07:32.852
I was particularly impressed
by her life's ambition

07:32.852 --> 07:35.354
to work for world peace and
open an aerobics dance studio.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.857
Now, wait a minute.
Look at this one here.

07:37.857 --> 07:38.858
Ooh, yeah.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.360
Not that often you see an
impression of Edward G. Robinson

07:41.360 --> 07:43.362
while twirling a baton.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.866
CLIFF: Hey, Woody, Miss Indiana.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.735
Yeah, but Boston's my home now.

07:52.955 --> 07:55.458
? Dum dum da da da da da ?

07:55.458 --> 07:56.959
? De da da da de. ?

07:56.959 --> 07:59.462
Anytime you're ready, Sam.

07:59.462 --> 08:01.464
Gee, I'd love to propose to you, Diane,

08:01.464 --> 08:04.467
but I'm tied up kind of
for the rest of my life.

08:06.636 --> 08:08.638
Deep down inside,

08:08.638 --> 08:10.389
you know this is going to happen.

08:11.674 --> 08:14.177
You're going to propose to me.

08:14.177 --> 08:16.812
You say that every day.

08:16.812 --> 08:19.098
But I don't say this every day.

08:19.098 --> 08:22.101
It's today.

08:23.986 --> 08:27.523
That is one scary woman.

08:30.193 --> 08:33.078
Sammy, come on. It's
late. It's time to go home.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.580
It's my turn to lock up.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.082
Besides, you look tired.
You need your rest.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.583
And you might do something
stupid that you'll regret

08:39.085 --> 08:40.086
for the rest of your life. Go on.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.587
Would you relax, please?

08:41.587 --> 08:44.090
Do I look like a guy who's
about to do something stupid?

08:44.090 --> 08:46.092
Always.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.094
That's not the point, Sam.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.096
Leave me alone, will ya?

08:50.096 --> 08:52.598
Guys, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna lock up now.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.100
Yeah, all right, Sammy.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.601
We can watch the rest of this meat show

08:55.601 --> 08:56.602
over at Normie's house.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.104
No, no, no. No, no, no.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.606
Vera won't let me watch those,
uh, beauty contests, Cliffie.

09:00.606 --> 09:01.607
Yeah? How come?

09:02.108 --> 09:04.110
Well, she...she's says
they're degrading to women

09:04.110 --> 09:06.112
and they make me randy as a jackrabbit.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.949
Woody,

09:09.949 --> 09:11.901
you go on home. I'll finish up here.

09:11.901 --> 09:13.286
I want to be alone with Sam.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.987
Run, Sam, run!

09:17.373 --> 09:20.376
Diane, don't you think...

09:20.876 --> 09:22.878
You know, on second thought,
guys, why don't you take off?

09:23.379 --> 09:24.380
I'd like to have

09:24.380 --> 09:26.882
a little private moment here with Diane.

09:29.385 --> 09:31.387
That's it! It is all over!

09:31.887 --> 09:33.256
Now...

09:33.256 --> 09:35.007
I don't have the
strength to fight anymore.

09:35.007 --> 09:38.010
All chance of victory is gone.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.514
The only thing for me now is to go home,

09:41.514 --> 09:44.016
pick up the pieces of my shattered life,

09:44.517 --> 09:47.019
and try to go on.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.523
Good night, Miss Chambers.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.024
And, uh, good luck.

09:52.024 --> 09:53.025
Oh, thanks, Woody.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.027
But since Sam and I are
destined to be married,

09:55.027 --> 09:57.530
luck is the one thing we don't need.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.531
Oh.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.032
Well, how about a salad bowl?

10:03.002 --> 10:05.871
Yes, that would be nice.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.257
Great. You saved me
some shopping. (chuckles)

10:08.257 --> 10:09.258
Good night, Woody.

10:09.258 --> 10:11.260
Good night, Sammy.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.261
Good night, Woody.

10:12.261 --> 10:15.131
Well, Sam, you clever boy.

10:15.131 --> 10:18.134
Since you've arranged
for us to be alone,

10:18.134 --> 10:19.635
I'm all ears.

10:19.635 --> 10:22.638
But you better hurry. Almost midnight.

10:22.638 --> 10:25.141
I wanted to talk to you alone

10:25.141 --> 10:26.642
'cause I didn't want
to embarrass you in...

10:26.642 --> 10:29.645
in front of the other people.

10:29.645 --> 10:31.647
Sit down, will you, please?

10:33.649 --> 10:36.535
Look, Diane...

10:37.987 --> 10:41.791
I want you to stop this nonsense
about me proposing to you.

10:41.791 --> 10:44.243
About us being married.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.746
About us getting... about us period.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.214
I've had it. That's it.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.716
I don't want to hear any more.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.502
Yes, Sam, fine, fine,

10:53.502 --> 10:55.004
but you really should get at it, okay?

10:55.004 --> 10:56.505
Would you stop it, please?

10:56.505 --> 10:58.007
Man, you're making me nuts!

10:58.007 --> 10:59.392
This is exactly what I'm talking about!

11:01.010 --> 11:03.763
You know, all right,
it was fun for a while,

11:03.763 --> 11:05.765
like a little game, but
it's not cute anymore.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.266
It's serious, Diane.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.235
You know, I-I was really

11:09.735 --> 11:12.238
ticked off at first
when you turned me down.

11:12.238 --> 11:15.241
But now I see how smart you were.

11:15.241 --> 11:19.195
I am never gonna ask
you to marry me again.

11:19.195 --> 11:20.196
Can I be any more clear than this?

11:20.196 --> 11:24.700
I'm never gonna ask
you to marry me again.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.202
Oh, no, oh, no, no, come on, Oh, no, no!

11:26.202 --> 11:28.204
No, no, no, no, stop that!

11:28.204 --> 11:29.088
Listen, you know how much

11:29.088 --> 11:30.923
I hate it when you cry.

11:30.923 --> 11:33.426
But I know you know, so it's
not gonna work. Forget it.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.879
This really hadn't occurred to me...

11:38.381 --> 11:41.467
...but I guess it's
actually a possibility.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.853
I'm not listening. Uh-uh.

11:45.104 --> 11:48.107
(humming)

11:50.526 --> 11:53.979
Maybe you don't love me.

11:53.979 --> 11:56.982
(sobbing): God in
heaven, it's not possible!

11:56.982 --> 11:57.983
(laughs)

11:57.983 --> 11:59.485
(continues sobbing)

11:59.485 --> 12:00.986
Nothing! That's it!

12:00.986 --> 12:02.488
It's not affecting me at all.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.372
I'm immune to this stuff.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.242
Yeah, you're not gonna soften me up.

12:06.242 --> 12:07.243
No way. That's it.

12:07.243 --> 12:09.245
(sobbing)

12:09.245 --> 12:11.247
You know, it's not gonna
make me feel sorry for you.

12:11.247 --> 12:13.249
In fact, I'll tell you
what it's gonna make me do.

12:13.249 --> 12:14.750
You want to know what
it's gonna make me do?

12:14.750 --> 12:16.252
I'm gonna tell you what
it's gonna make me do.

12:16.252 --> 12:18.754
It's gonna make me propose
to you, is what it's gonna do.

12:18.754 --> 12:22.141
Oh, come on, don't...don't cry.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.095
Oh, Diane,

12:26.095 --> 12:27.980
will you marry me?

12:27.980 --> 12:28.764
No, Sam.

12:29.765 --> 12:31.650
(steel bars slamming)

12:31.650 --> 12:35.104
PRIEST: The Lord is my
Shepherd; I shall not want.

12:35.104 --> 12:37.106
In verdant pastures, He gives me repose.

12:37.106 --> 12:39.608
Beside restful waters, He leads me.

12:39.608 --> 12:41.610
He refreshes my soul...

12:41.610 --> 12:45.581
Oh, Warden, have you heard
from the governor yet?

12:45.581 --> 12:48.584
I'm sorry, Sam.

12:48.584 --> 12:50.586
Oh, well.

12:50.586 --> 12:52.087
He maketh me lie down in green pastures;

12:52.087 --> 12:54.590
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.091
He restoreth my soul;

12:56.091 --> 12:58.093
He leadeth me in the paths of ri...

12:58.093 --> 13:01.597
Father, do you really
believe in the afterlife?

13:02.097 --> 13:05.718
Yes, my son, I do.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.219
Well, good.

13:07.219 --> 13:13.225
Maybe I can find her
there, and... get her again!

13:13.225 --> 13:15.611
(creaking)

13:15.611 --> 13:16.312
(groans)

13:16.612 --> 13:19.198
Mmm-mmm! Ooh!

13:19.698 --> 13:21.200
What's wrong?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.702
Mmm. Oh...

13:23.702 --> 13:24.703
I just had a flash

13:24.703 --> 13:27.706
that I got the electric
chair for killing you.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.213
Well, that's silly.

13:34.213 --> 13:38.217
Massachusetts doesn't
have the death penalty.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.586
What?

13:43.556 --> 13:46.926
Uh...

13:48.344 --> 13:50.846
Nothing. Nothing at all.

13:50.846 --> 13:53.349
No death penalty, huh?

13:53.349 --> 13:54.850
No, not at present,

13:54.850 --> 13:59.355
but I'm-I'm sure they're...
going to reinstate it.

14:02.358 --> 14:05.861
In fact, I'm on my way to...

14:05.861 --> 14:07.863
campaign for it at this very moment.

14:07.863 --> 14:08.864
Excuse me.

14:09.365 --> 14:10.366
(squeals)

14:17.489 --> 14:20.826
Hey, everybody, you're
not going to believe this.

14:20.826 --> 14:21.827
Well, you passed the bar.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.212
I'll believe anything.

14:23.212 --> 14:27.082
Yeah? Well, Sam's in jail, smarty pants.

14:27.082 --> 14:28.083
What? Yeah.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.553
Diane had him arrested
for assault and battery.

14:31.053 --> 14:34.056
My hero.

14:35.758 --> 14:36.592
Is Diane all right?

14:36.592 --> 14:37.593
I think she's fine.

14:37.593 --> 14:39.595
I just don't have all the details.

14:39.595 --> 14:40.596
Well, how do you know all this stuff?

14:40.596 --> 14:41.597
Sam called me

14:42.097 --> 14:43.098
to retain my services.

14:43.098 --> 14:46.602
Oh, to do what, prune his trees?

14:46.602 --> 14:48.103
Has he been arraigned yet?

14:48.103 --> 14:49.104
No, 2:00.

14:49.104 --> 14:50.105
CARLA: Well, maybe

14:50.105 --> 14:51.607
we ought to go down to the courthouse

14:51.607 --> 14:53.609
in case Sammy needs character witnesses.

14:53.609 --> 14:55.611
No, they don't do that
until the trial, Carla.

14:55.611 --> 14:57.079
Well, what sort of
defense you plan on using?

14:57.079 --> 14:59.081
I'm thinking about pleading insanity.

14:59.081 --> 15:01.083
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.084
What about Sammy?

15:11.210 --> 15:13.128
Bail is set at $2,500.

15:13.128 --> 15:14.630
Next case.

15:22.638 --> 15:24.640
Your Honor, I swear I never touched her.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.525
Take a seat.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.896
Case number one five
seven eight six--

15:30.896 --> 15:32.398
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

15:32.398 --> 15:33.399
versus Sam Malone.

15:33.899 --> 15:34.900
Defendant is charged

15:34.900 --> 15:36.402
with willful assault...

15:36.402 --> 15:38.404
(clattering thud)

15:39.905 --> 15:40.906
Oh, what is this?

15:41.407 --> 15:42.908
I swear I never laid a
hand on her, Your Honor.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.410
Mr. Malone...

15:44.410 --> 15:46.412
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Just take a seat, Miss...

15:46.912 --> 15:48.414
Chambers. Thank you.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.416
JUDGE: The defendant is charged

15:50.416 --> 15:52.418
with willful assault and battery

15:52.418 --> 15:53.919
against the person
of one Diane Chambers.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.304
How does the defendant plead?

15:55.304 --> 15:56.722
Not guilty.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.724
Motions, gentlemen.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.225
Your Honor,

16:00.225 --> 16:02.645
due to the violent
circumstances of this crime,

16:02.645 --> 16:04.146
and in order to protect the victim

16:04.146 --> 16:05.648
from a reoccurrence of
the events of evening last,

16:05.648 --> 16:08.651
the State recommends that
bail be set at an amount

16:09.151 --> 16:11.403
commensurate with the serious
nature of this offense.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.187
Motion denied.

16:12.187 --> 16:13.188
Hey! I'm the one that's

16:13.188 --> 16:14.573
supposed to say that.

16:17.860 --> 16:19.361
Right, right.

16:19.361 --> 16:21.613
Sorry, Your Honor,
uh, it's my first case.

16:21.613 --> 16:22.915
You're kidding!

16:25.834 --> 16:28.337
Your Honor, my client, uh,

16:28.337 --> 16:30.339
has no prior convictions or arrests.

16:30.339 --> 16:31.340
A well-known businessman

16:31.340 --> 16:33.342
and respected member of this community.

16:33.342 --> 16:35.344
I therefore move that bail be waived

16:35.344 --> 16:36.845
and he be released on
his own recognizance.

16:36.845 --> 16:38.347
I don't think Mr. Malone poses

16:38.347 --> 16:40.349
any general threat to
the community; so moved.

16:40.349 --> 16:41.216
All right!

16:41.967 --> 16:43.802
Sorry, Your Honor.

16:45.304 --> 16:49.308
Trial is set for two months
from this date at 10:00 a.m.

16:49.308 --> 16:52.277
All right, everybody,
it's been a long day.

16:52.277 --> 16:54.279
This court will reconvene
tomorrow morning.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.781
Your Honor?

16:55.781 --> 16:58.784
Yes, Miss, uh... Chambers?

16:58.784 --> 17:00.285
Would it be all right

17:00.285 --> 17:02.788
if I said something at this time?

17:02.788 --> 17:05.790
I don't think that's really necessary.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.161
I think it might help
to expedite matters.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.914
Well, if you must, but please be brief.

17:11.914 --> 17:14.333
Oh, geez...!

17:17.336 --> 17:20.339
Your Honor, I just want you to know...

17:20.339 --> 17:22.223
Should I come up there?

17:22.223 --> 17:24.510
Why not?

17:27.396 --> 17:29.398
Your Honor, I, I just want you to know

17:29.398 --> 17:30.899
that I understand
why the accused--

17:31.400 --> 17:33.402
and, by the way, the
man I intend to marry--

17:33.402 --> 17:35.270
was, uh,

17:35.270 --> 17:37.239
was upset last night.

17:37.239 --> 17:39.241
After all, I did just turn down

17:39.241 --> 17:41.243
his proposal of marriage.

17:41.243 --> 17:43.245
I see. But if you intend to marry him,

17:43.245 --> 17:45.247
why did you say no to his proposal?

17:46.248 --> 17:48.250
It's a long story.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.251
Make it a short one,

17:49.251 --> 17:52.254
and maybe we can save the
good people of Massachusetts

17:52.254 --> 17:53.622
the cost of a trial.

17:53.622 --> 17:55.874
Well, let's see.

17:55.874 --> 17:56.875
Um, the accused and I

17:56.875 --> 17:58.877
have been going together

17:58.877 --> 18:00.879
on and off for about four years.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.383
I guess you could
describe our relationship

18:04.383 --> 18:05.884
as a bit stormy,

18:05.884 --> 18:08.387
but that's also part of its excitement.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.391
Earlier this year,

18:12.391 --> 18:13.892
the accused proposed to me.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.778
I said no

18:15.778 --> 18:17.029
because I thought

18:17.029 --> 18:19.031
he was on the rebound
from another relationship.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.532
I was wrong,

18:20.532 --> 18:22.818
so I changed my mind.

18:22.818 --> 18:25.370
But he wouldn't propose to
me again, the little dickens.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.791
Until last night, that is,

18:28.791 --> 18:31.326
but this time I fear...

18:31.326 --> 18:34.329
he was only asking me to marry him

18:34.329 --> 18:36.832
because I was crying and upset...

18:36.832 --> 18:38.834
albeit unintentional.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.837
It was emotional blackmail on my part.

18:41.837 --> 18:43.305
I couldn't say yes

18:43.305 --> 18:45.808
under those circumstances.

18:45.808 --> 18:46.809
You do understand,

18:47.309 --> 18:48.811
don't you, Your Honor?

18:48.811 --> 18:51.313
I'm sorry, I was just trying to imagine

18:51.313 --> 18:53.182
the long version of the story.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.942
Although... gallant,

19:03.942 --> 19:05.160
his proposal

19:05.160 --> 19:06.195
couldn't have been sincere.

19:06.195 --> 19:07.696
The accused was merely respons...

19:07.696 --> 19:10.833
Hey, will you say my
na... Sam, my name is Sam.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.334
Make her say my name, will you please?

19:12.334 --> 19:14.336
Calm down, Mr. Malone.

19:14.336 --> 19:16.338
Go on, Miss Chambers.

19:16.338 --> 19:19.341
Well, the next thing I know, the acc...

19:19.341 --> 19:21.844
Sam is chasing me
down the street--

19:21.844 --> 19:23.846
for six blocks,
to be exact--

19:23.846 --> 19:25.347
until I tripped and fell...

19:26.798 --> 19:28.183
...thus sustaining my injuries,

19:28.183 --> 19:30.102
a bruised thigh and a wrenched neck.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.104
Did he hit you or push you in any way?

19:33.355 --> 19:35.607
Well, no.

19:35.607 --> 19:36.608
Not exactly.

19:36.608 --> 19:37.609
JUDGE: Look, Miss Chambers,

19:37.609 --> 19:39.611
it doesn't appear that Mr. Malone

19:39.611 --> 19:41.613
is directly responsible
for your injuries.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.615
Now, is there any way
I could persuade you

19:43.615 --> 19:45.117
to drop the charges against him?

19:46.985 --> 19:49.321
I have a solution, if
it pleases the court.

19:49.321 --> 19:52.824
If you can get us out of this,
it absolutely thrills the court.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.827
What if my client proposes to her again?

19:55.827 --> 19:56.828
Yes, I could alwa...

19:56.828 --> 19:58.330
Are you crazy?!

19:58.330 --> 20:01.333
(bangs gavel)

20:01.333 --> 20:02.334
I like the idea.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.753
Does the State have any
objections to his proposing?

20:04.753 --> 20:06.255
None, Your Honor.

20:06.255 --> 20:07.256
How about it, Miss Chambers?

20:07.256 --> 20:08.257
This all right with you?

20:10.726 --> 20:15.731
I suppose it would be all right
if it were a sincere proposal.

20:16.231 --> 20:19.735
Well, I guess it's
your move, Mr. Malone.

20:19.735 --> 20:21.236
You mean, I have to propose to her

20:21.236 --> 20:22.237
to keep from going to jail

20:22.237 --> 20:24.239
where I wouldn't be
going in the first place

20:24.239 --> 20:26.241
if she'd said yes to any
one of my three proposals?

20:26.742 --> 20:29.194
That's a very ironic way of putting it.

20:30.612 --> 20:33.615
Now, which is it going to
be, a wedding or a trial?

20:36.118 --> 20:38.120
How long would I have to be in jail?

20:43.625 --> 20:46.628
Diane, will you marry me?

20:46.628 --> 20:50.465
That didn't sound very sincere.

20:52.467 --> 20:55.971
I ask the court, did that sound sincere?

20:55.971 --> 20:56.972
No, it didn't.

20:58.473 --> 21:00.475
Try again.

21:00.475 --> 21:04.980
Y-You, you have no idea
what you're sentencing me to.

21:04.980 --> 21:08.984
Mr. Malone, come up here
and let's get this over with.

21:19.578 --> 21:24.082
Diane...

21:24.082 --> 21:27.002
will you marry me?

21:36.812 --> 21:38.647
Okay.

21:38.647 --> 21:39.648
JUDGE: Case dismissed.

21:39.648 --> 21:40.515
(pounds gavel)

21:40.515 --> 21:41.483
Congratulations.

21:41.984 --> 21:42.985
BAILIFF: All rise.

21:42.985 --> 21:44.987
What do you know?

21:44.987 --> 21:46.488
I got you off!

21:46.488 --> 21:48.991
Thank you, Tom. Yeah,

21:48.991 --> 21:50.993
Yeah, all in a day's
work, Sammy, my boy.

21:50.993 --> 21:54.496
You're looking at
Thomas Babson, Esquire...

21:54.496 --> 21:55.998
undefeated.

21:57.499 --> 21:58.500
Oh, Tom?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.502
Uh, if you got any time next week,

22:00.502 --> 22:01.503
my trees need pruning.

22:01.503 --> 22:03.505
How about Saturday? Be fine; thanks.

22:07.843 --> 22:08.710
Well,

22:08.710 --> 22:11.179
guess I don't need this for a while.

22:23.775 --> 22:27.279
Sam... I'm sorry.

22:27.279 --> 22:32.234
I guess I got a little carried away.

22:32.234 --> 22:33.735
(sighing)

22:33.735 --> 22:37.239
I wanted to expose our relationship

22:37.239 --> 22:39.741
to the scrutiny of the court.

22:41.159 --> 22:44.162
God knows I've tried to figure it out.

22:44.162 --> 22:46.164
I'm at a complete loss.

22:46.164 --> 22:48.166
Oh, it makes perfect sense to me.

22:49.167 --> 22:53.171
You want me to propose
to you. I propose to you.

22:53.171 --> 22:57.175
You say no, I say fine, I
never want to see you again.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.560
You drive me nuts

22:58.560 --> 23:00.929
telling me you want me to propose again.

23:00.929 --> 23:02.431
I do, you turn me down.

23:02.931 --> 23:05.434
Next thing I know, I'm in a court of law

23:05.434 --> 23:08.937
where I've got to propose
to you or I'll go to jail.

23:08.937 --> 23:11.440
It's the classic American love story.

23:17.195 --> 23:19.197
That's pretty absurd.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.534
Well, don't worry.

23:22.534 --> 23:26.538
I'm not going to hold
you to that proposal.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.507
I know it was made

23:28.507 --> 23:30.041
under duress.

23:31.927 --> 23:33.845
(sighing)

23:33.845 --> 23:35.847
Bye, Sam.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.850
Where are you going?

23:38.850 --> 23:42.354
You know, you're not
going to get off that easy.

23:42.354 --> 23:46.358
No, you're going to pay
for what you put me through.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.859
What do you mean?

23:47.859 --> 23:50.362
I proposed to you, you said yes.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.864
Now, they can stop me from killing you,

23:52.864 --> 23:55.367
but they can't stop
me from marrying you.

23:57.953 --> 24:00.205
Oh, Sam!

24:01.305 --> 24:07.492
