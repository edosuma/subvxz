01:19.370 --> 01:22.601
<i>I am Death, Denny Colt.</i>

01:22.807 --> 01:27.744
<i>You are the only man who has</i>
<i>ever escaped my cold embrace.</i>

01:28.246 --> 01:31.113
<i>But I am never far away.</i>

01:33.551 --> 01:35.712
<i>Yes.</i>

01:35.920 --> 01:38.548
<i>I'm always with you.</i>

02:17.628 --> 02:19.459
- Yeah.
- Something big is breaking down...

02:19.664 --> 02:21.029
...by the mudflats, Spirit.

02:21.232 --> 02:22.859
<i>By the wreck of an old cargo ship.</i>

02:23.201 --> 02:25.567
Word on the street
is The Octopus might be in on it.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.759
<i>I'd call it in...</i>

02:28.105 --> 02:30.573
...but who knows
how far his tentacles spread?

02:30.775 --> 02:32.208
<i>Who we can trust?</i>

02:33.411 --> 02:34.673
I'm on my way.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.883
<i>My city. She's always there for me.</i>

03:52.924 --> 03:56.792
<i>Every lonely night, she's there for me.</i>

03:57.128 --> 04:01.565
<i>She's not some tarted-up fraud</i>
<i>all dressed up like a piece of jailbait.</i>

04:02.166 --> 04:03.793
<i>No. She's an old city...</i>

04:04.001 --> 04:07.732
<i>... old and proud of her every pock</i>
<i>and crack and wrinkle.</i>

04:08.272 --> 04:11.867
<i>She's my sweetheart, my plaything.</i>

04:13.644 --> 04:16.112
<i>She doesn't hide what she is,</i>
<i>what she's made of:</i>

04:16.314 --> 04:20.045
<i>Sweat, muscle</i>
<i>and blood of generations.</i>

04:28.392 --> 04:29.484
<i>She sleeps.</i>

04:29.694 --> 04:33.152
<i>After midnight and until dawn,</i>
<i>only shadows move in the silence.</i>

04:33.364 --> 04:35.161
There she is!

04:35.499 --> 04:37.433
- Get her.
- <i>Damn, I've got no time for this.</i>

04:38.402 --> 04:41.200
<i>My city screams. She needs me.</i>

04:44.609 --> 04:47.874
<i>She is my love. She is my life.</i>

04:48.079 --> 04:49.979
<i>And I am her Spirit.</i>

05:16.540 --> 05:19.031
Don't worry, you're safe now.
Try to catch your breath.

05:19.243 --> 05:21.711
- Here, let's get you to your feet.
- Police!

05:21.912 --> 05:23.209
Over here, MacReady.

05:23.414 --> 05:26.076
This is a good man, you can trust him.
Tell him everything.

05:26.283 --> 05:28.717
- I will.
- Call your shrink if you got one.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.995
What are you?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.617
That's The Spirit.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.479
God bless him.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.116
<i>She provides for me, my city does.</i>

06:12.229 --> 06:16.131
<i>She gives me everything I need.</i>

06:20.504 --> 06:22.563
Move it over, Liebowitz. I'm driving.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.888
Sussman called.

07:18.095 --> 07:20.120
Something's going down here.
Could be big.

07:20.331 --> 07:22.299
- How big?
- Octopus big.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.798
- Jesus! We better call for backup.
- Not just yet.

07:25.002 --> 07:27.732
Sussman wants this one
kept under the radar for now.

07:27.938 --> 07:30.839
<i>Yes. Come closer. Come home to me.</i>

07:31.041 --> 07:32.941
You hear that, boss?

07:33.244 --> 07:34.711
Every goddamn night.

07:35.279 --> 07:40.148
Lorelei. The angel of death.
She's never far away. Not from me.

07:40.351 --> 07:43.252
They say only sailors and cops
can hear her.

07:44.155 --> 07:46.214
Well, I'm not a sailor.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.688
And I'm not a cop.

07:58.469 --> 08:00.096
- Officer down.
- <i>Roger that, I copy.</i>

08:00.304 --> 08:01.737
Get an ambulance. Call Dolan.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.839
- <i>Commissioner</i>...
- Not Commissioner Dolan.

08:04.041 --> 08:05.474
- Dr. Dolan.
- Still breathing.

08:05.676 --> 08:08.509
- Spirit says he's still breathing.
- <i>Keep me advised.</i>

08:08.712 --> 08:10.145
Hurts like a son of a bitch.

08:10.481 --> 08:11.971
Take it easy. We'll get you home.

08:13.584 --> 08:15.211
That broad.

08:15.419 --> 08:18.115
- You should have seen her.
- Broad?

08:18.322 --> 08:20.153
A beautiful broad.

08:20.357 --> 08:21.619
She was beautiful.

08:21.826 --> 08:24.124
Keep him talking. Keep him awake.

08:24.328 --> 08:26.592
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.823
Yeah. She was beautiful.

10:14.204 --> 10:16.399
If this is the wrong box,
I'll kill you myself.

10:16.607 --> 10:18.905
Just get us out of here.
It's The Octopus.

10:19.576 --> 10:20.804
You know what he can do.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.411
Shut up and bleed.

10:31.388 --> 10:33.413
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.720
She was beautiful.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.692
And she wasn't looking
for a fight, either.

10:42.232 --> 10:43.221
Easy, now.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.402
Just breathe through your nose
if you can.

10:48.005 --> 10:49.165
Getting dizzy.

10:49.373 --> 10:52.069
Steady. Steady.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.505
Heads up!

11:05.022 --> 11:06.614
Take it home, boys.

11:06.824 --> 11:11.227
When me and The Spirit get together,
we like to party all night.

11:24.975 --> 11:31.141
There is nothing I like better
than kicking your ass all night long.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.675
Except maybe eggs.

11:38.522 --> 11:39.511
Where's the truck?

11:39.723 --> 11:41.384
Silken Floss is the most
beautiful woman.

11:41.592 --> 11:43.389
How do we find our way home
without her?

11:43.594 --> 11:45.653
Silken Floss is the most beautiful
woman ever.

11:45.863 --> 11:47.125
She was supposed to be here.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.128
How do we find our way home
without her?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.960
Where's the truck?

11:51.168 --> 11:52.601
I found the truck!

11:52.803 --> 11:56.432
Silken Floss
is the most beautiful woman ever.

12:00.978 --> 12:03.208
Load up the box and pile in,
specimens.

12:03.414 --> 12:06.008
You've done your
petri dishes proud.

12:08.185 --> 12:11.712
No need to wait for the boss
if that's The Spirit back there.

12:12.222 --> 12:16.056
The Octopus always finds his nemesis
so distracting.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.093
It is The Spirit. He had his hat on.
We was watching.

12:19.563 --> 12:21.497
Well, then, they'll be at it all night.

12:21.698 --> 12:24.758
- Yeah, boss said so.
- Boss said so. We was watching.

12:24.968 --> 12:28.404
Oh, God. Yeah. I heard.

12:30.574 --> 12:34.101
Silken Floss is the most beautiful...

12:57.201 --> 12:59.032
You're giving me a headache,
Octopus.

13:01.305 --> 13:03.796
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better, pretty boy.

13:04.007 --> 13:05.474
You're right about that.

14:26.823 --> 14:28.688
Come on!

14:29.026 --> 14:30.994
Toilets are always funny.

14:52.115 --> 14:53.309
I was watching.

15:04.461 --> 15:07.430
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.

15:08.832 --> 15:10.766
Pretty boy.

15:11.802 --> 15:13.929
Tough boy.

15:14.771 --> 15:17.467
I'll be seeing you again...

15:17.674 --> 15:18.698
...real soon.

15:19.142 --> 15:21.269
I'm gonna be the death of you,
Octopus.

15:22.679 --> 15:23.771
Death?

15:23.981 --> 15:26.506
Not for me, brother. Death, he says.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.878
I'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead.

15:29.086 --> 15:31.919
I had you beat like eggs.

15:32.122 --> 15:33.919
Heck you did.

15:34.124 --> 15:37.218
Anybody watching could've seen
I had you right where I wanted you.

15:37.427 --> 15:39.361
In your dreams.

15:39.963 --> 15:41.521
You're an accident.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.393
You never should've happened.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.125
Your mind ain't right, Octopus.

15:46.336 --> 15:50.363
You're talking crazy.
You're talking crazy talk.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.372
We're the only two like us, pretty boy.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.772
- I'm nothing like you.
- Nothing like me?

15:57.781 --> 16:01.649
Well, you sure can take
a lot of punishment, sweetheart.

16:01.852 --> 16:03.114
Just like me.

16:04.921 --> 16:05.945
You ever wonder why?

16:08.959 --> 16:11.553
Never even crossed my mind.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.923
Well, I'll be learning you!

16:14.131 --> 16:17.999
I'll be learning you real soon.

16:18.201 --> 16:19.964
I'll be learning you.

16:26.543 --> 16:28.010
Oh, well, look who's here.

16:28.211 --> 16:30.679
Boss, we better get out of here.

16:44.961 --> 16:47.122
<i>Such pain.</i>

16:47.564 --> 16:49.794
<i>Such suffering.</i>

16:51.234 --> 16:52.929
<i>Sleep.</i>

16:56.406 --> 16:58.738
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

16:58.942 --> 17:00.500
<i>Wake up.</i>

17:01.678 --> 17:03.305
Wake up.

17:05.682 --> 17:06.876
Wake up.

17:07.084 --> 17:08.449
Hey, baby.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.483
- Ellen.
- You're a mess.

17:11.021 --> 17:12.682
Three bullets across the deltoid.

17:12.888 --> 17:15.255
They went straight through me.
Hardly took any meat.

17:15.459 --> 17:17.551
Major contusions on any visible skin.

17:17.761 --> 17:19.592
Oh, come on, Ellen.
They never last long.

17:19.796 --> 17:22.788
Evidence of a profusely bleeding
cranial wound.

17:22.999 --> 17:25.092
No, that's nothing. That's just a bump.

17:25.301 --> 17:27.133
Yeah, you're a mess, all right.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.703
- Really, I'm okay.
- No, this is serious.

17:29.906 --> 17:32.306
For God's sake,
you can't keep taking these chances.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.501
- I'll be fine.
- You're bleeding out of your head.

17:40.384 --> 17:43.444
- It's gone all sticky. It'll stop.
- You need to be admitted.

17:43.653 --> 17:46.747
No. You know how much I hate that.
It takes forever.

17:46.957 --> 17:50.324
- Don't fight me this time.
- I'll be all right. It's just...

17:50.527 --> 17:53.223
I'm missing something.
It's really important.

17:54.731 --> 17:56.460
- Do you know where you are?
- Sure.

17:56.666 --> 17:59.226
- What city?
- Central City, U.S.A.

17:59.436 --> 18:00.801
What year is it?

18:01.004 --> 18:02.596
This year.

18:02.806 --> 18:04.865
- Do you know who you are?
- The Spirit.

18:05.075 --> 18:07.543
- I beat up bad guys.
- And sometimes they beat you up.

18:07.744 --> 18:10.713
And it really hurts when that happens,
but I always get better.

18:10.914 --> 18:14.247
I don't know why. You don't know why.
But The Octopus knows something.

18:14.451 --> 18:15.440
Why do you say that?

18:15.652 --> 18:17.449
Because he told me
he knows something.

18:18.422 --> 18:20.720
- You're delirious. Come on.
- No.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.589
Oh, golly, will you look at that.

18:24.394 --> 18:25.452
That was close, buddy.

18:25.662 --> 18:27.960
I was looking all over for you.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.927
There. That's better.

18:32.135 --> 18:34.365
Yup. That's better.

18:35.439 --> 18:36.770
That tears it.

18:36.973 --> 18:38.099
You're delusional.

18:38.308 --> 18:39.775
- Tuska, over here!
- Ellen!

18:41.378 --> 18:44.609
Dr. Ellen Dolan! Over here, right now!

18:48.985 --> 18:50.452
I can hear fluid in his chest.

18:50.654 --> 18:52.315
It's faint, but I swear it's there.

18:58.862 --> 19:00.989
I got it. He's got blood
in both his lungs.

19:01.198 --> 19:02.756
Stabilize him, get him on Pegasus.

19:02.966 --> 19:05.161
- Go back to the helicopter.
- I'll flip him over.

19:05.368 --> 19:08.064
No, leave him flat. Get me new gloves.
Gauze.

19:12.843 --> 19:16.745
Hurry it up. If you can't move any faster,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.347
- You find anything?
- No, sir.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.915
I'm just feeling dizzy
from all the action, I guess.

19:22.118 --> 19:24.416
- Yeah, we're all damn impressed.
- Thanks.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.089
You're doing this town no good
with your hot-dogging.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.451
- I don't follow you.
- We're flat on our asses...

19:29.659 --> 19:31.923
...happy to clean up
after your dog-and-pony show.

19:32.128 --> 19:33.823
Not this again. You know the score.

19:34.030 --> 19:35.964
I thought I did.
Go ahead and enlighten me.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.360
Bring me up to speed.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.092
Sussman wanted things kept quiet.
Leave it at that.

19:40.303 --> 19:41.895
He thinks I don't run a tight ship?

19:42.105 --> 19:45.506
Suspected a leak in your department.
Didn't want The Octopus getting away.

19:45.709 --> 19:48.769
So you're Internal Affairs now, huh?
I must have missed that memo.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.539
Come on, it was a judgment call.
I gave it my best shot.

19:51.748 --> 19:54.945
I got one officer an inch from dying,
another, his head yanked off...

19:55.151 --> 19:57.619
...because you went off half-cocked
after The Octopus.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.312
You're damn right
I'm going after The Octopus!

20:00.524 --> 20:02.788
And you're going through my men
like toilet paper.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.585
You been to Dropsie Avenue and C?

20:04.794 --> 20:06.284
- Have you seen those girls?
- Yeah.

20:06.496 --> 20:10.125
Some just learning how to ride a bike,
there they are, selling their souls...

20:10.333 --> 20:12.460
...slaves to The Octopus
and his poison.

20:12.669 --> 20:17.333
Maybe you and your force
could use a little obsession, Dolan.

20:17.541 --> 20:21.068
Maybe you and your force
could work a little harder.

20:21.278 --> 20:24.805
Ellen's right. You're off your rocker,
talking about cops like that.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.415
Maybe if you and your force
could find The Octopus...

20:27.617 --> 20:30.381
...I wouldn't have to play it solo.
- Solo, huh?

20:30.587 --> 20:31.611
Solo?

20:31.821 --> 20:33.721
That wasn't our deal, hotshot.

20:33.924 --> 20:36.757
Well, then maybe we don't have a deal
anymore, commissioner.

20:37.594 --> 20:38.583
Why, you <i>...</i>

20:45.535 --> 20:47.696
You're living at the edge of a cliff, son.

20:47.904 --> 20:51.897
And all you got is a tired old man
trying to hold you back.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.769
Look, we're both tired.

20:57.847 --> 20:59.314
Yeah.

20:59.816 --> 21:02.683
- Yeah.
- Just give me 10 minutes.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.917
Hell, I don't know why I even bother
to try and talk to you anymore.

21:07.123 --> 21:09.489
Just give me 10 minutes.

21:09.693 --> 21:11.217
Just to clear my head.

21:11.428 --> 21:13.623
Right. Sure.

21:14.931 --> 21:18.697
What's 10 minutes
in a man's life anyway?

21:19.336 --> 21:20.360
Spirit?

21:20.570 --> 21:22.094
Sir.

21:23.073 --> 21:26.042
That cliff I was talking about?

21:26.443 --> 21:28.274
There's no bottom.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.441
Don't jump.

21:37.087 --> 21:40.818
<i>"What are you?"</i>
<i>That's what the woman asked me.</i>

21:41.024 --> 21:42.958
<i>It's a good question.</i>

21:43.159 --> 21:45.593
<i>I wish I had an answer for her.</i>

21:45.795 --> 21:48.059
<i>Am I a crazy man?</i>

21:48.398 --> 21:50.889
<i>Or am I a man at all?</i>

21:52.102 --> 21:53.729
<i>Some nights, like this one...</i>

21:53.937 --> 21:57.134
<i>... when the wind bites deep,</i>
<i>bone deep...</i>

21:57.340 --> 22:01.504
<i>... and even my city</i>
<i>seems to leave me behind, I wonder:</i>

22:01.711 --> 22:03.542
<i>Am I some sort of ghost?</i>

22:03.747 --> 22:06.341
<i>Some sort of Flying Dutchman?</i>

22:06.583 --> 22:09.017
<i>If the wind picked up</i>
<i>hard enough...</i>

22:09.285 --> 22:11.412
<i>... would I just blow away?</i>

22:12.055 --> 22:13.579
<i>I'm not a cop.</i>

22:13.790 --> 22:15.655
<i>Not anymore.</i>

22:16.159 --> 22:18.525
<i>Not even a dead man.</i>

22:19.562 --> 22:21.826
<i>Not even a spirit.</i>

22:24.768 --> 22:27.601
We made it, boss.
Just like you said we would.

22:31.174 --> 22:32.300
You still here?

22:32.909 --> 22:36.902
Of course I'm still here. I'm your trigger.
I blowed holes right through The Spirit.

22:37.113 --> 22:39.479
You're a trigger, Pathos.

22:39.683 --> 22:40.809
Just look at you.

22:41.885 --> 22:43.819
Quick Draw McGraw himself.

22:44.020 --> 22:46.318
I'll be great.
I don't have any bones sticking out.

22:46.523 --> 22:48.684
A couple of splints, I'll be good to go.

22:48.892 --> 22:52.555
Yeah, just hop right over to St. Alice's,
get fixed up all nice and new.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.526
I'll have to explain why
a criminal mastermind like myself...

22:55.732 --> 22:58.257
...doesn't provide his employees
with medical insurance.

22:58.468 --> 23:00.902
That'd be egg on my face, Pathos.

23:01.104 --> 23:05.564
You know I don't like
egg on my face.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.402
- Hadn't thought of that.
- No.

23:07.610 --> 23:10.909
Using your brain?
That, you weren't built for.

23:11.114 --> 23:12.979
Just tell me
where the emergency room is.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.641
I'll tell them I'm one of the homelesses.
They don't make them pay.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.980
Homelesses always get hurt.
Because it's free.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.884
- That'll work!
- So will this.

23:25.061 --> 23:29.122
No egg on my face!

23:29.599 --> 23:30.998
Not a glob!

23:34.437 --> 23:36.337
Not a glob.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.016
Any other case, little buddy.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.276
Any other job.

23:49.619 --> 23:52.179
If it were anyone but her.

23:55.325 --> 23:56.952
Sand.

23:57.761 --> 24:00.594
Sand Saref.

24:09.706 --> 24:10.934
Where's your bike?

24:11.141 --> 24:13.439
You scrape your knee,
or are you scared for a race?

24:13.643 --> 24:15.611
No, I got sick of that stupid bike.

24:15.812 --> 24:18.679
You got sick of losing races to me
is more like it.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.238
Where'd you put it?

24:20.850 --> 24:22.977
I pawned it over at Fellman's.

24:23.186 --> 24:26.019
- I got a few bucks for it.
- Pawned it?

24:29.793 --> 24:31.317
Look there.

24:32.328 --> 24:33.761
I bet those are real diamonds.

24:35.331 --> 24:37.458
You see how they catch the light,
Denny?

24:38.535 --> 24:40.662
Only real ones do that.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.808
What's with you?

24:49.779 --> 24:51.178
Nothing much.

24:51.381 --> 24:54.441
- He's not drinking again, is he?
- No, no, he's not drinking.

24:54.651 --> 24:56.278
What's got you needing money, then?

24:57.253 --> 25:01.155
Just something that I saw
over at the window at Kurtzman's.

25:01.357 --> 25:02.790
Is it a badge, like my dad's?

25:02.992 --> 25:04.425
No, no. It wasn't a badge.

25:04.627 --> 25:06.424
Good, you ain't hardly
earned a badge.

25:06.629 --> 25:10.087
Well, it was something
that I thought that, you know...

25:11.501 --> 25:15.528
...you might like seeing
as how you like shiny things and all.

25:21.544 --> 25:26.004
It opens up too.
You can take it and look at the picture.

25:27.450 --> 25:30.749
If you don't like it, old man Kurtzman
said he'd take it back.

25:35.225 --> 25:36.817
Do you like it?

25:44.033 --> 25:46.024
So you want me to be your girl?

25:47.637 --> 25:50.629
Yeah, sure. I mean, if...

25:50.840 --> 25:52.569
You know, if it's all the same to you.

25:52.775 --> 25:55.573
Well, I suppose I can wear it
now and then.

25:58.281 --> 26:01.944
- But that doesn't make me your girl.
- Yeah. Doesn't make <i>...</i>

26:15.064 --> 26:18.033
Yeah, we had us a time, all right.

26:18.234 --> 26:19.861
The way only city kids could.

26:20.470 --> 26:21.562
I love it!

26:35.485 --> 26:38.249
It says here Heracles himself
fought with the Argonauts.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.789
Imagine Jason and Heracles
back-to-back.

26:41.991 --> 26:45.017
- Yeah.
- Jason gleaming in his Golden Fleece.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.423
Yeah. Yeah.

27:04.781 --> 27:08.239
Then everything went right
straight to hell.

27:09.452 --> 27:12.421
<i>My Uncle Pete was</i>
<i>a has-been fighter.</i>

27:12.622 --> 27:16.422
<i>Sand's dad, a beat cop who was</i>
<i>always looking out for dumb old Pete.</i>

27:16.626 --> 27:20.118
Hey, Pete! What's all this?
What's all...?

27:30.206 --> 27:33.471
<i>My Uncle Pete did the only thing</i>
<i>his punch-battered brain...</i>

27:33.676 --> 27:35.644
<i>... could tell him to do.</i>

27:39.949 --> 27:43.282
<i>Sand got there</i>
<i>a few minutes before me.</i>

27:46.155 --> 27:47.144
Come on.

27:47.357 --> 27:49.985
<i>I tried to be strong for both of us.</i>

27:50.693 --> 27:52.160
Come on.

27:53.396 --> 27:57.298
<i>I said some stuff.</i>
<i>I can't remember what.</i>

27:58.501 --> 28:01.163
<i>And then that jerk reporter</i>
<i>latched onto us.</i>

28:01.371 --> 28:02.429
Sol, I can't miss this.

28:02.638 --> 28:04.731
So, kids, just how does this
make you feel?

28:04.941 --> 28:06.033
Are you scared?

28:06.242 --> 28:09.336
- We ain't talking, so leave us alone.
- You gotta give me something.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.507
<i>I'll give you something.</i>

28:11.714 --> 28:13.682
<i>I'll give you three words.</i>

28:14.350 --> 28:16.045
<i>I hate cops.</i>

28:16.252 --> 28:17.685
Just leave us alone, will you?

28:21.391 --> 28:24.019
I know you're heartbroke, Sand.

28:24.594 --> 28:26.528
So am I,
but you didn't mean what you said.

28:26.729 --> 28:28.128
Leave me alone, stay away.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.060
- Give it a while.
- Give it a while?

28:30.266 --> 28:33.326
- What? What, us?
- Well, yeah, that's what I mean.

28:33.536 --> 28:36.403
So, sure, we grow up
and we have kids in this sinkhole?

28:36.606 --> 28:38.233
You're just not talking straight.

28:38.441 --> 28:41.467
And you become a cop
just like you always wanted to.

28:42.311 --> 28:44.575
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I do.

28:44.781 --> 28:48.649
Yeah, and then some punched-out
drunk of an old boxer shoots you dead?

28:48.851 --> 28:51.046
- Do you think I want that?
- It wasn't Pete!

28:51.254 --> 28:54.348
- It was that guido, and you know that.
- Who cares?

28:54.557 --> 28:56.718
You know what?
I don't want your world.

28:56.926 --> 29:00.054
I want diamonds,
and I want sports cars...

29:00.263 --> 29:03.664
...and I want long dresses
and I want money. And I want lots of it.

29:03.866 --> 29:06.699
And where are you going to find
all that, Sand?

29:06.903 --> 29:09.895
I'm not gonna find it here.
Not in this toilet of a town.

29:10.273 --> 29:13.674
So you're too good for me?
You're too good for all of us? Is that it?

29:15.812 --> 29:19.248
I am too good for you,
and I am too good for this dump.

29:19.916 --> 29:22.282
- I'm going away, I'm going far away.
- All right.

29:22.485 --> 29:24.578
I'm gonna go
all over the world, become rich...

29:24.787 --> 29:27.813
...and no one is ever gonna know
that I came from this hole!

29:28.024 --> 29:29.616
No one.
And I am never coming back.

29:30.026 --> 29:31.493
Then do whatever you want, Sand!

29:32.962 --> 29:35.954
I don't care about you neither.
I never even wanna see you again!

29:36.165 --> 29:38.258
I hate you, Sand.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.567
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

29:47.710 --> 29:50.178
<i>Word is she took off for Europe.</i>

29:51.180 --> 29:54.115
I never knew if she was alive or dead.

29:56.018 --> 29:58.009
Until now.

30:00.223 --> 30:03.192
There's only one way this locket
ended up in poor Sussman's hand.

30:03.392 --> 30:06.361
She was there. She was wearing it.
She is implicated.

30:06.562 --> 30:08.496
If she's doing business
with The Octopus...

30:08.698 --> 30:10.393
...then my feelings
don't mean a damn.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.034
I must find Sand Saref...

30:13.236 --> 30:15.136
...and bring her in.

30:24.147 --> 30:26.377
My beautiful Sand Saref.

30:26.582 --> 30:28.846
Are you missing something, my love?

30:29.819 --> 30:31.878
Nothing important.

30:33.890 --> 30:37.121
Just something I lost a long time ago.

30:46.736 --> 30:49.136
Mark this moment, all of you.

30:49.338 --> 30:51.670
A new age begins.

30:51.874 --> 30:53.933
An age of great deeds.

30:54.143 --> 30:58.102
An age of great power.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.407
Yes.

31:00.750 --> 31:03.241
All mine.

31:03.753 --> 31:07.382
The blood of Heracles is mine.

31:33.182 --> 31:36.083
I am sorely disappointed.

31:38.054 --> 31:39.578
Which one of you brought me this?

31:39.789 --> 31:41.450
I guess that'd be me.

31:41.857 --> 31:44.621
- On your knees, then.
- Sure thing.

31:46.128 --> 31:48.062
What happened?
What went wrong?

31:48.264 --> 31:50.061
Nothing went wrong,
thanks for asking.

31:50.266 --> 31:53.030
Where's my vase? I'm supposed
to have a vase full of blood.

31:53.236 --> 31:56.433
- It's supposed to be in that box.
- Must've been in the other box.

31:56.639 --> 31:57.765
What other box?

31:57.974 --> 32:00.101
Must've been in the other box.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.174
What other box, you fart?

32:02.678 --> 32:05.374
The one the pretty lady run off with.
We was watching.

32:05.581 --> 32:06.878
Sand Saref.

32:07.216 --> 32:10.549
I thought I scared her off
with time to spare.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.247
What's she doing in Central City,
anyway?

32:13.456 --> 32:18.917
It didn't occur to you doorstops to
mention that there was a second box?

32:19.128 --> 32:22.359
Nope, but it looked just like this one.
We was watching.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.492
Seppuku across the stomach,
left to right.

32:30.072 --> 32:31.733
That tickles.

32:31.974 --> 32:34.772
With the sword, toe cheese.

32:38.914 --> 32:41.382
So Sand Saref has the blood.

32:41.584 --> 32:45.076
You know, you could've offed her
and brought back both boxes.

32:45.288 --> 32:47.483
That would've simplified things
considerably.

32:47.690 --> 32:49.954
Oh, I'm supposed
to do everything around here?

32:50.459 --> 32:52.086
Now, that'll wake you up.

32:52.295 --> 32:54.286
You have to do something
about Sand Saref.

32:54.497 --> 32:56.897
Don't worry about Sand Saref.

32:57.099 --> 33:00.296
That lady's got a thing for the bling.

33:00.636 --> 33:04.333
She was after that other box
and whatever it is that's inside of it.

33:04.540 --> 33:07.100
It's kind of creepy
the way it glows like that.

33:07.310 --> 33:10.302
So the situation's hardly a debacle.

33:10.513 --> 33:13.812
Sand Saref has
the blood of Heracles, yes.

33:14.016 --> 33:17.008
But we have what she wants.

33:17.219 --> 33:20.211
- All right, you fatheads listening to me?
- We sure are, boss.

33:20.423 --> 33:24.086
Find Sand Saref, find her now.
Tell her I have no problem with her.

33:24.293 --> 33:27.421
She can have her creepy,
blingy thingy.

33:28.731 --> 33:30.528
Get me that blood.

33:30.733 --> 33:31.825
And keep it safe!

33:32.034 --> 33:34.764
Spill one drop
and I'll turn you all into hamburger.

33:34.970 --> 33:38.428
Don't forget about The Spirit.
He's someone to contend with.

33:38.641 --> 33:43.374
He's like a piece of gum stuck to the
bottom of your shoe that won't let go.

33:43.579 --> 33:44.978
You know what I mean?

33:45.181 --> 33:48.344
The kind you step on in the summer
that just won't let go.

33:48.551 --> 33:50.382
Am I doing this right?

33:50.586 --> 33:52.019
Yeah, looks good.

33:52.221 --> 33:54.314
I was just wondering,
because it really smarts.

33:54.523 --> 33:56.457
I hate stepping on gum,
even in winter.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.650
Makes you step funny.

33:59.128 --> 34:02.825
We're gonna kill The Spirit,
and we're gonna kill him now.

34:03.032 --> 34:04.294
Or sometime soon.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.127
He doesn't publish his address.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.735
We're not going to look for him.

34:08.938 --> 34:11.168
He's gonna come to us. Real soon.

34:11.806 --> 34:13.706
You have a plan.

34:13.909 --> 34:18.072
I left the man a clue
that will lead him right to us.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.840
Right soon, I promise.

34:21.050 --> 34:23.210
What's the hurries, anyway?

34:23.418 --> 34:25.944
If The Spirit drinks the blood...

34:26.155 --> 34:29.522
...if he so much as realizes
what it could do to him...

34:29.725 --> 34:32.159
...what it could turn him into,
then we're finished.

34:32.561 --> 34:34.222
And because I said so.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.659
I am a man of my word, Ms. Saref.

34:39.068 --> 34:40.330
Are you?

34:40.536 --> 34:43.801
Take the promises you made
to your lovely new wife.

34:44.005 --> 34:45.974
"Forsaking all others," and all that.

34:46.175 --> 34:48.268
Let's not get personal, shall we?

34:48.476 --> 34:51.139
Oh, we shall.

34:51.347 --> 34:54.839
I commissioned you to find a certain
treasure for me, Mr. Donenfeld.

34:55.050 --> 34:58.076
It was to mark the climax of my career.

34:58.821 --> 35:00.982
Its crown jewel.

35:01.190 --> 35:04.785
The lost treasure of the Argonauts.

35:04.994 --> 35:08.760
And it was even worth me
coming back to this horrid city...

35:09.398 --> 35:11.195
...just to touch it.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.697
To hold it.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.961
To have it be mine.

35:15.171 --> 35:19.073
The shiny thing
to end all shiny things.

35:19.442 --> 35:23.105
And I paid you a fortune for it.

35:23.312 --> 35:27.442
And it would've been worth
every nickel, but you screwed me.

35:27.650 --> 35:30.414
So now we're gonna take
every last one of those nickels...

35:30.619 --> 35:33.019
...and transfer them
into another bunch of accounts.

35:33.222 --> 35:35.281
What on earth are you talking about?

35:35.491 --> 35:37.391
You're gonna be
quite the philanthropist.

35:38.027 --> 35:42.123
Oh, type the numbers in for him,
darling. He seems a tad dyspeptic.

35:42.331 --> 35:45.323
I'm going to need your password,
sweetheart.

35:53.909 --> 35:55.399
All right.

35:55.611 --> 35:57.078
All right.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.441
It's robin.

35:59.648 --> 36:01.582
R-O-B-l-N. Like the bird.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.308
Or like the kid sidekick.

36:03.519 --> 36:07.751
You know, the one with the cute
little tights and the tight little derrière.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.524
It's going through.

36:11.927 --> 36:13.121
Transfer complete.

36:15.030 --> 36:16.964
Why the devil are you
doing this to me?

36:17.166 --> 36:18.929
You sold me out.

36:19.134 --> 36:21.659
- I didn't have any choice.
- Imagine my surprise...

36:21.871 --> 36:24.931
...when I show up at the drop point
and ran smack into The Octopus.

36:25.541 --> 36:27.600
I mean, what are the odds of that?

36:28.811 --> 36:32.838
Unless you sold
the Argo's treasure twice...

36:33.048 --> 36:36.381
...making a perfect ass of yourself.

36:38.387 --> 36:40.685
A perfect ass.

36:41.023 --> 36:43.321
Well, he didn't give me any choice.

36:43.759 --> 36:46.284
- He's The Octopus, he threatened my...
- Your family.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.794
Take a good look at those pictures.

36:49.999 --> 36:54.265
They'll reach your family and every
news service on the planet...

36:54.470 --> 36:57.098
...unless you render them irrelevant.

37:00.442 --> 37:02.910
At least die bravely...

37:03.479 --> 37:05.174
...rodent.

37:21.163 --> 37:23.222
Hold all calls.

37:24.667 --> 37:26.658
Excuse me, got any change?

37:31.507 --> 37:33.498
What can I say?

37:33.709 --> 37:37.076
Last night you were 20 minutes
from the morgue, and now look at you.

37:38.247 --> 37:39.805
Just look at you.

37:41.684 --> 37:45.518
I'd recommend three days' bed rest,
but why waste my breath?

37:45.721 --> 37:47.848
Look who's talking.
You take the night off.

37:48.057 --> 37:50.719
Yeah, I'm sure Mrs. Mahoney's
heart transplant can wait.

37:50.926 --> 37:55.363
And we might as well just hold off and
see if old Spankowitz's liver explodes.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.795
You need to have some fun.
Put your feet up, relax.

37:59.001 --> 38:00.593
Maybe go see a show.

38:02.638 --> 38:04.731
What about you, big man?

38:06.075 --> 38:08.669
- What's on your agenda tonight?
- Oh, I don't know.

38:08.877 --> 38:11.368
Things stay quiet,
I'd be up for anything.

38:11.814 --> 38:13.714
- Anything?
- Sure, anything.

38:13.916 --> 38:14.905
Dinner, movie.

38:15.484 --> 38:17.111
Anything.

38:18.420 --> 38:20.786
- So long as things stay quiet?
- Yeah.

38:20.990 --> 38:23.584
- So long as things stay quiet.
- Sure.

38:23.792 --> 38:26.852
Like every crook in Central City
goes on sabbatical?

38:27.229 --> 38:30.289
Or maybe if I break the rules.

38:31.967 --> 38:34.299
I feel like breaking all kinds of rules.

38:34.503 --> 38:36.300
- Lower the blinds.
- They're all down.

38:36.505 --> 38:38.200
Oh, fast hands.

38:38.407 --> 38:39.601
And quiet.

38:39.808 --> 38:42.140
- And sneaky.
- We'll keep things quiet, all right.

38:42.511 --> 38:44.138
Very, very quiet.

38:45.981 --> 38:49.644
Keep the mask on. Something tells me
it might be better that way.

38:59.828 --> 39:01.193
Oh, Ellen, I lo...

39:01.397 --> 39:04.958
You're in love with every woman
you meet, Mr. Spirit.

39:06.669 --> 39:08.432
You say lovely things to all of us...

39:09.438 --> 39:12.703
...and you mean every word you say.
Every time.

39:12.908 --> 39:15.342
Ellen, it's only you.

39:17.079 --> 39:18.910
But we don't even know
your real name.

39:20.315 --> 39:22.215
I'll tell you my name.

39:25.521 --> 39:27.887
Someday I'd love to do
your autopsy.

39:28.090 --> 39:29.523
Oh, thanks for the thought.

39:29.725 --> 39:31.192
I'd make a fortune.

39:31.393 --> 39:33.520
Spirit! Front and center!

39:34.997 --> 39:37.966
- He's all yours. Fresh as a daisy.
- You should get some sleep.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.328
- You look like hell.
- Love you too, Daddy.

39:40.536 --> 39:43.630
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Spirit.
I'm Morgenstern.

39:43.839 --> 39:46.364
Rookie, fresh from Baltimore.

39:47.810 --> 39:49.505
Good to have you aboard,
Morgenstern.

39:51.647 --> 39:53.842
Come on,
we haven't got the whole day.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.689
- Dr. Dolan, I can't thank you enough.
- Just doing my job, sir.

40:07.996 --> 40:09.122
Bastard.

40:14.903 --> 40:16.803
- Marry me.
- Just doing my job, sir.

40:17.005 --> 40:18.404
And what a job it is.

40:18.607 --> 40:20.837
Central City's own masked manhunter.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.704
You're worshipped by the kids.

40:22.911 --> 40:24.902
Anything you'd care
to share with them?

40:25.114 --> 40:28.083
Play it straight, youngsters.
Don't be too tough on your parents.

40:28.283 --> 40:30.410
<i>They work hard. And remember...</i>

40:30.619 --> 40:32.143
<i>... brush your teeth.</i>

40:32.354 --> 40:33.685
Every word a pearl of wisdom.

40:33.889 --> 40:36.221
<i>Don't forget to remind them</i>
<i>to take their vitamins.</i>

40:36.425 --> 40:37.687
<i>And for the ladies?</i>

40:37.893 --> 40:39.884
You know,
we hang on your every word.

40:40.262 --> 40:43.026
<i>Well, I don't think I could say anything</i>
<i>other than thanks...</i>

40:43.599 --> 40:47.000
...for being such amazing,
lovely creatures.

40:47.202 --> 40:48.362
<i>No two alike.</i>

40:51.807 --> 40:53.536
<i>Jesus!</i>

40:55.077 --> 40:57.910
- Ever meet a skirt you didn't chase?
- Just trying to be nice.

40:58.113 --> 40:59.546
You've been nice to my daughter.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.909
When will you break her heart,
lounge lizard?

41:02.117 --> 41:05.280
- Lounge lizard? Where do you get off?
- I'll call you anything I want.

41:05.487 --> 41:07.478
I don't know
why I bother talking with you.

41:07.689 --> 41:10.590
Because we fight crime,
and right now we got our hands full.

41:10.793 --> 41:14.559
You noticed, have you? Thought with
all the tail you chase, you'd forgotten.

41:14.763 --> 41:15.991
It's The Octopus.

41:16.198 --> 41:18.666
Again with The Octopus.

41:19.501 --> 41:22.026
He's up to something big
and it's got to do with me.

41:22.237 --> 41:24.171
He said some weird stuff
about him and me.

41:24.373 --> 41:26.967
I gotta find out what he's talking about.
It's important.

41:27.176 --> 41:28.507
Hold it.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.206
Can we forget about The Octopus
for one minute?

41:33.415 --> 41:35.246
Just one minute?

41:35.517 --> 41:38.680
Now, we got us a hot case
and a murder suspect...

41:38.887 --> 41:41.151
...who's hauling her butt
to the airport.

41:41.356 --> 41:42.983
- Her?
- Name is Sand Saref.

41:43.192 --> 41:45.023
- Sand Saref?
- Sand Saref.

41:45.227 --> 41:46.888
- Local girl.
- Only picture of her.

41:47.095 --> 41:48.289
It's over 15 years old.

41:48.497 --> 41:50.465
Father was a cop.
Took one in the face.

41:50.666 --> 41:52.600
Disappeared following
her father's murder...

41:52.801 --> 41:54.962
Told some snoop reporter
that she hated cops.

41:55.170 --> 41:57.934
- Right on TV, she said she hated cops.
- She hated cops.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.869
- That's what I said.
- Moved to Europe.

42:00.075 --> 42:03.272
Eight marriages later, runs every
jewelry heist this side of Bulgari.

42:03.478 --> 42:04.740
Except for in Central City.

42:04.947 --> 42:07.006
- She never came back.
- You never heard of her.

42:07.216 --> 42:10.674
- You never heard of her, right?
- She never came home.

42:11.119 --> 42:13.417
You on drugs or something?

42:15.290 --> 42:16.848
Come on.

42:17.893 --> 42:19.087
Behind the lines, folks.

42:19.294 --> 42:21.057
Behind the lines.

42:22.865 --> 42:24.992
- Commissioner.
- Sand Saref.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.430
She's overseen
hundreds of jewelry robberies...

42:27.636 --> 42:31.003
...and in not one case was
a police officer so much as wounded.

42:31.206 --> 42:33.231
Now, what are the odds
of that, huh?

42:33.442 --> 42:35.034
Sounds like an Electra complex.

42:35.244 --> 42:37.735
- What's that?
- Electra complex. Plain as your face.

42:37.946 --> 42:39.504
Honey, I'm just an <i>alter cocker.</i>

42:39.715 --> 42:41.148
Give me something to work with.

42:42.117 --> 42:43.141
Old fart.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.946
Jews today. Can't take time
to learn their own language.

42:46.154 --> 42:48.145
Electra complex.

42:48.357 --> 42:51.622
It's like an Oedipal complex
except it's for girls.

42:51.827 --> 42:53.454
She doesn't hate cops.

42:53.662 --> 42:55.721
She's just angry she lost her daddy.

42:55.931 --> 42:58.729
Electra complex, plain and simple.

42:59.301 --> 43:02.202
Damn. This girl's gonna
make detective in no time.

43:02.404 --> 43:03.803
Thank you, sir.

43:04.840 --> 43:07.604
- You like her new jacket?
- Excuse me?

43:07.809 --> 43:10.539
You can't take your
eyes off the ladies.

43:10.746 --> 43:14.477
There's no chance in hell you haven't
noticed Morgenstern's new flak jacket.

43:14.683 --> 43:18.312
- Even if you are on drugs.
- I'm not on drugs.

43:20.689 --> 43:22.850
State of the art, these jackets.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.855
We had us a shipment
of these babies...

43:25.060 --> 43:27.392
...but we couldn't pay for them
until today...

43:27.596 --> 43:30.759
...when we got a very generous
private donation to the force.

43:30.966 --> 43:33.196
One hundred million dollars
generous.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.391
A lot of money.

43:34.603 --> 43:38.004
You're damn straight it is.
It was like a bolt out of the blue.

43:38.206 --> 43:40.902
An online donation. Anonymous.

43:41.109 --> 43:42.599
Yeah, sure, anonymous.

43:42.811 --> 43:46.110
Took our brain boys all of an hour
to track it right back here.

43:46.315 --> 43:49.580
To the offices of an expert
in ancient artifacts.

43:49.785 --> 43:52.845
Yeah, who turned said artifacts
into a fortune.

43:53.055 --> 43:55.455
You might say he was a purveyor
of stolen property...

43:55.657 --> 43:58.785
...or, as we put it in the vernacular,
a fence.

43:58.994 --> 44:02.930
A world-class fence
by the name of Donenfeld.

44:03.131 --> 44:04.120
Yeah.

44:04.333 --> 44:09.999
But <i>quelle surprise,</i> old Donenfeld,
he ain't looking so good.

44:10.706 --> 44:12.936
And my good buddy Seth here...

44:13.575 --> 44:15.372
...he says the old man had a visitor...

44:15.577 --> 44:17.943
...just about the same time
he got the hard goodbye.

44:18.146 --> 44:20.376
What did you say her name was
again there?

44:20.582 --> 44:22.812
Sand. Sand Saref.

44:23.018 --> 44:24.576
She didn't have an appointment.

44:24.786 --> 44:28.381
Sand Saref. Some moniker, huh?

44:28.590 --> 44:30.421
Yeah, it's a strange name.

44:30.625 --> 44:33.116
- It's one of a kind.
- Yeah.

44:34.329 --> 44:36.024
And my good buddy Seth here...

44:36.231 --> 44:39.689
...he couldn't be bothered
to even call it in.

44:39.901 --> 44:41.960
My hands were tied, officer.

44:42.170 --> 44:44.502
Mr. Donenfeld had a standing order.

44:44.706 --> 44:47.573
I was never to come into his office
unless he called me in.

44:47.776 --> 44:49.334
Never.

44:49.544 --> 44:51.603
Never, ever, ever.

44:51.813 --> 44:53.804
Yeah. Sure, kid.

44:54.016 --> 44:57.315
Morgenstern, get his number.

44:59.755 --> 45:01.985
No. Not murder, not her.

45:02.190 --> 45:03.817
It's not possible.

45:08.263 --> 45:10.731
- So you do know her.
- No.

45:10.932 --> 45:13.230
- lf you're holding back on me <i>...</i>
- I'm not.

45:13.435 --> 45:15.801
Your whole theory,
it doesn't make any sense.

45:16.004 --> 45:19.667
Hey, it fits together like goddamn
macramé once you factor in her <i>...</i>

45:19.875 --> 45:21.604
What'd you call it again there?

45:21.943 --> 45:24.537
- Electra complex.
- Yeah, that.

45:24.746 --> 45:26.008
It's psychobabble.

45:26.381 --> 45:28.349
Trying to hang a murder rap
on that woman...

45:28.550 --> 45:30.142
...over some piece
of psychobabble?

45:30.352 --> 45:34.220
Her name is Sand Saref and you
know her and you're covering for her.

45:34.423 --> 45:37.449
- I never heard of any Sand Saref.
- You're lying!

45:37.659 --> 45:40.321
- Get your hand off my arm, Dolan.
- You're lying to me.

45:40.529 --> 45:43.760
Let go of my arm
before I break yours.

45:48.804 --> 45:50.032
Orders, sir?

45:51.373 --> 45:52.362
Tail him.

45:54.142 --> 45:55.973
He's lying.

45:58.680 --> 46:01.843
You did a neat little job
up there, Sand.

46:02.050 --> 46:04.075
You shouldn't have signed it.

46:19.935 --> 46:24.599
Officer Morgenstern, you wanna help,
find me a lead to The Octopus.

46:31.146 --> 46:32.807
I will see it.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.581
- There.
- I'm in.

46:42.257 --> 46:45.556
And the aces have it.

46:58.206 --> 47:00.299
This I keep as a souvenir.

47:00.509 --> 47:04.070
The rest goes to the man who can
get a message to The Octopus.

47:14.956 --> 47:18.983
<i>I thought I was closing in,</i>
<i>putting it all together.</i>

47:19.194 --> 47:22.027
<i>That three years on,</i>
<i>here in my second life...</i>

47:22.230 --> 47:24.721
<i>... I had a pretty good idea</i>
<i>of what I had to do.</i>

47:24.933 --> 47:27.493
<i>It all got down to me</i>
<i>and The Octopus.</i>

47:27.702 --> 47:29.533
<i>We were headed for a showdown.</i>

47:29.738 --> 47:32.036
<i>I was finally gonna scrub</i>
<i>the city clean of him...</i>

47:32.240 --> 47:33.229
<i>... once and for all.</i>

47:33.441 --> 47:35.306
<i>It wasn't pretty</i>
<i>but it was simple enough.</i>

47:35.510 --> 47:37.876
<i>Then you come along like</i>
<i>a sack of rocks to my face.</i>

47:38.079 --> 47:40.877
<i>What's the story, Sand?</i>
<i>What the heck is going on?</i>

47:41.082 --> 47:43.380
<i>All night, I've been rolling it around</i>
<i>in my skull.</i>

47:43.585 --> 47:46.554
<i>You and The Octopus?</i>
<i>You and murder?</i>

47:46.755 --> 47:48.086
<i>Dolan's gotta be wrong.</i>

47:48.290 --> 47:51.350
<i>There's gotta be more to this,</i>
<i>some explanation.</i>

47:51.560 --> 47:53.528
<i>Not murder, not you.</i>

47:53.728 --> 47:56.094
<i>Can't believe that about you.</i>

47:56.298 --> 47:58.061
<i>You were tough, Sand,</i>
<i>on the outside...</i>

47:58.266 --> 47:59.927
<i>... but inside, you were warm.</i>

48:00.135 --> 48:02.228
<i>And soft.</i>

48:02.437 --> 48:04.803
<i>All woman.</i>

48:05.407 --> 48:07.466
<i>One thing I'd bet</i>
<i>my bottom dollar on:</i>

48:07.676 --> 48:10.167
<i>You wouldn't be caught dead</i>
<i>hiding out in a fleabag...</i>

48:10.378 --> 48:12.903
<i>... like any ordinary</i>
<i>criminal would. No.</i>

48:13.114 --> 48:15.776
<i>No, your taste was</i>
<i>always first-class.</i>

48:16.718 --> 48:18.583
<i>All the way.</i>

48:22.057 --> 48:23.149
<i>Weird.</i>

48:25.126 --> 48:27.321
That's just plain damn weird.

48:27.529 --> 48:30.760
Sir, you promised the new
hyper-addictive synapse accelerant...

48:30.966 --> 48:33.093
...would be ready by last week.

48:33.301 --> 48:36.270
Don't you think
that's plain damn weird?

48:41.576 --> 48:45.012
Yes, sir. Just plain damn weird.

48:45.213 --> 48:47.647
Also, our profits
are down 20 percent.

48:47.849 --> 48:51.250
Good. I was beginning to think
it was just me.

48:51.453 --> 48:52.920
That's plain damn weird.

48:53.388 --> 48:54.412
Yes, sir.

48:54.623 --> 48:57.057
I was trying to make us a smart one...

48:57.259 --> 48:59.557
...and this thing
just sort of popped out.

48:59.761 --> 49:02.491
Twenty percent across the board.

49:03.832 --> 49:07.097
Reduce the price on the old stuff,
we'll make it up in units.

49:07.302 --> 49:09.896
Word has hit the streets
about the side effects.

49:10.105 --> 49:13.165
No one likes having their teeth
turned into graham crackers.

49:14.209 --> 49:17.508
How can I get anything done
with all this time on my hands?

49:17.712 --> 49:20.442
Besides, when my buddies here
find Sand Saref...

49:20.649 --> 49:22.708
...I won't need profits,
I'll have the blood.

49:22.917 --> 49:25.112
Then if I want something,
I'll just take it.

49:25.320 --> 49:27.220
That's what gods do.

49:32.060 --> 49:35.223
He is really damn little.

49:36.097 --> 49:37.325
I mean...

49:37.532 --> 49:39.159
...it's really little.

49:39.367 --> 49:42.131
- They can't find her.
- Yeah, we can't find her.

49:42.337 --> 49:44.669
- We looked everywhere.
- Except where she was.

49:44.873 --> 49:46.807
- We should've looked there.
- We did look.

49:47.008 --> 49:48.908
- Where's that?
- Kill them all, please.

49:49.110 --> 49:50.372
Just kill them all.

49:50.578 --> 49:51.738
We can't spare them.

49:51.946 --> 49:53.072
- We're running low.
- Yeah.

49:53.281 --> 49:55.215
- You're running low on us.
- Floss said so.

49:55.417 --> 49:57.282
We was listening.

49:57.485 --> 49:59.510
I'm depressed.

50:00.622 --> 50:03.819
I wish The Spirit would come so
I could get me some real killing done.

50:04.025 --> 50:08.724
I told you already,
that's going to be complex.

50:17.405 --> 50:20.636
Spirit thinks he can't stay hurt.

50:21.343 --> 50:25.302
That stuff I put in him and me
is unstable.

50:25.714 --> 50:28.012
Might not last.

50:28.216 --> 50:30.844
The blood will take care of that.

50:31.386 --> 50:36.323
Meanwhile, I'm getting
El Espirito dead while I still can.

50:36.658 --> 50:38.489
To that end...

50:38.693 --> 50:41.184
...I got us another opinion.

50:41.629 --> 50:42.857
Brought in a specialist.

50:44.165 --> 50:47.794
Someone to seal the deal.

51:06.888 --> 51:08.355
You speak to my soul, monsieur.

51:10.225 --> 51:13.126
The black-eyed Venus
is in Suite 1510.

51:16.531 --> 51:19.261
Long time no see, Sand.

51:25.373 --> 51:28.570
You gonna arrest me? Or do you have
something else in mind?

51:28.777 --> 51:30.335
I'm bringing you in.

51:30.545 --> 51:32.069
Hands behind your head.

51:33.882 --> 51:34.871
You sure about that?

51:35.250 --> 51:36.717
Don't make me repeat myself.

51:36.918 --> 51:38.715
Hands behind your head.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.286
Your wish is my command.

51:45.326 --> 51:46.418
Okay.

51:46.628 --> 51:49.256
Put a robe on or something
but no tricks.

51:49.464 --> 51:52.092
Yes, sir, Mr. Spirit, sir.

51:55.870 --> 51:58.100
Oh, watch out for my husband,
you'll trip.

52:00.341 --> 52:02.332
Why this?

52:03.211 --> 52:06.305
It's not like I killed him.
He did it to himself about an hour ago.

52:06.514 --> 52:08.880
It's all the fault
of this goddamned vase.

52:09.083 --> 52:11.415
He tasted the stuff
and, well, see for yourself.

52:11.619 --> 52:14.213
- It's stolen.
- Oh, yeah.

52:14.422 --> 52:16.856
You are a common criminal.

52:17.058 --> 52:18.787
There's nothing common about me.

52:18.993 --> 52:23.157
You're a criminal. I'm bringing you in
for the murder of a fence, Donenfeld.

52:23.364 --> 52:24.991
If you're gonna lock me up...

52:25.200 --> 52:28.226
...do it over something
I am actually guilty of, stupid.

52:28.436 --> 52:29.698
Oh, you're guilty of a lot.

52:30.405 --> 52:34.034
I could burn a priest's ears
confessing the half of it.

52:34.242 --> 52:36.642
But this time, my hands are clean,
crime fighter.

52:36.845 --> 52:39.405
So run on home,
wait for the forensics report.

52:39.614 --> 52:41.980
I haven't shot anybody in days.

52:42.183 --> 52:45.277
There probably isn't a law
on the books that you wouldn't break.

52:45.487 --> 52:47.648
Do I look like a good girl?

52:48.456 --> 52:49.980
You don't care who you've hurt?

52:51.159 --> 52:53.150
What's that got to do with anything?

52:53.361 --> 52:57.661
Sand, The Octopus, that fence
and you?

52:59.167 --> 53:01.601
Now, after all of these <i>...</i>

53:04.739 --> 53:06.900
Nothing fits together.

53:07.108 --> 53:09.633
There's that crazy talk
from The Octopus about him and...

53:09.844 --> 53:11.675
Listen, mister...

53:11.880 --> 53:12.869
...I don't care.

53:13.081 --> 53:16.016
I don't even care about people
that I like and I don't know you.

53:16.217 --> 53:19.948
No, of course you don't.
But things, now, those you care about.

53:22.023 --> 53:24.457
I don't see what use
I could possibly be to you.

53:24.659 --> 53:27.321
I have nothing to offer
this rotten little town of yours.

53:27.529 --> 53:30.396
As a matter of fact, I despise it.

53:30.598 --> 53:34.193
There's one thing between that river
and that ocean that I came here for.

53:34.402 --> 53:36.461
What? That stupid vase?

53:36.671 --> 53:38.662
It wasn't supposed to be a vase.

53:38.873 --> 53:42.240
It was supposed to be worth
something more than jewels.

53:42.911 --> 53:45.744
Something a little girl's dreams
are made of.

53:46.147 --> 53:48.980
I knew a little girl like that once.

53:50.318 --> 53:52.218
You don't know anything. Get out.

53:52.420 --> 53:55.287
She was a very sweet girl
but the world broke her heart.

53:55.490 --> 53:57.185
She wasn't after any vase.

53:57.392 --> 54:00.156
She was looking for a hero.
Weren't you, little girl?

54:00.361 --> 54:02.386
You were looking for a hero
and his armor.

54:02.597 --> 54:04.895
The only man who would know that
is dead.

54:05.099 --> 54:07.659
The Fleece. The Golden Fleece.

54:07.869 --> 54:09.131
Jason's Golden Fleece.

54:09.337 --> 54:12.465
He's dead.
You're dead. You're dead.

54:29.524 --> 54:31.583
- Will you look at that?
- Don't that beat all?

54:32.026 --> 54:33.050
Hey, it's The Spirit.

54:33.461 --> 54:35.929
- He's street pizza.
- He looks stupid.

54:36.130 --> 54:39.156
- Wanker.
- You'll believe a man can't fly.

54:39.367 --> 54:40.732
Jump already.

54:40.935 --> 54:42.596
<i>Jump, jump, jump</i>

54:42.804 --> 54:44.601
<i>Jump, jump, jump</i>

54:53.114 --> 54:55.412
Get me the hell out of here.

55:06.294 --> 55:07.886
Not right now. I'm kind of busy.

55:08.096 --> 55:10.291
It's Morgenstern.
I might have a lead for you.

55:10.498 --> 55:12.432
<i>Nobody noticed all of that salt.</i>

55:12.634 --> 55:13.965
It was right under our noses.

55:14.168 --> 55:17.262
- Could you pick up the pace?
- Salt. Industrial salt.

55:17.472 --> 55:20.339
One of The Octopus' henchmen,
we found him dead near the flats.

55:20.541 --> 55:21.974
Remember where Sussman got shot?

55:22.176 --> 55:25.441
Industrial salt,
it was caked all over his shoes.

55:25.647 --> 55:27.945
Dolan was right.
you'll make detective in no time.

55:28.149 --> 55:29.480
Thank you, sir.

55:29.884 --> 55:31.613
I gotta go.

56:06.654 --> 56:07.882
I'll buy you a drink.

56:08.089 --> 56:10.649
All right, folks, show's over.
Time to move on.

56:10.858 --> 56:14.123
Yeah, well, Sand,
that went great, didn't it?

56:14.328 --> 56:17.923
Reunions between old sweethearts
will have to wait.

56:18.132 --> 56:21.226
I got bigger fish to fry.
I'm coming after you, Octopus...

56:21.436 --> 56:24.803
...but before I kill you, you're gonna
answer me some questions.

56:33.481 --> 56:37.918
<i>Morgenstern said there was salt on</i>
<i>his shoes. There's plenty of it here.</i>

56:39.754 --> 56:42.518
<i>Plenty of bad guys too.</i>

56:42.724 --> 56:44.885
<i>All the enemy has</i>
<i>is guns and knives.</i>

56:46.194 --> 56:49.254
<i>I have an entire city as my weapon.</i>

56:54.502 --> 56:55.799
<i>My arsenal:</i>

56:56.003 --> 56:58.494
<i>Iron-jawed fire escapes.</i>

56:59.040 --> 57:00.564
<i>Man-made lightning.</i>

57:02.343 --> 57:03.742
<i>Unforgiving pavement.</i>

57:24.265 --> 57:26.324
<i>She provides for me.</i>

57:27.635 --> 57:29.068
<i>She protects me.</i>

57:31.906 --> 57:34.670
<i>She is my mother, my city is.</i>

57:36.744 --> 57:38.075
<i>She's a good mother.</i>

57:40.815 --> 57:42.874
<i>She always shows me the way.</i>

57:51.325 --> 57:53.885
What a fine detective.

57:54.095 --> 57:57.587
You followed the breadcrumbs
right to us.

58:06.474 --> 58:09.136
You're not doing anybody good
by falling asleep on the job.

58:09.343 --> 58:12.369
So why don't you go home,
get yourself some proper rest?

58:12.580 --> 58:14.741
You look like something
that the cat dragged in.

58:14.949 --> 58:16.917
So sweet of you to come by, Daddy.

58:17.118 --> 58:20.781
I was just checking in on Sussman.
They wouldn't let me see him. Twits.

58:20.988 --> 58:24.287
Sussman's still in critical,
they're trying to save his spine.

58:24.492 --> 58:27.757
Yeah? What's the odds
of him walking again?

58:27.962 --> 58:29.429
Hard to tell.

58:29.630 --> 58:31.063
Miracles do happen.

58:33.167 --> 58:34.896
Damn Spirit.

58:35.102 --> 58:37.127
- He's over the edge.
- Don't go there, Daddy.

58:37.338 --> 58:40.068
- He's a goddamn menace.
- He's something the world needs.

58:40.274 --> 58:41.468
He's a hero.

58:41.676 --> 58:44.440
He's a goddamn menace and my
own daughter's in love with him.

58:44.645 --> 58:46.772
He's why you're killing yourself,
waiting up.

58:46.981 --> 58:49.779
Yes. He's why I'm still here tonight.

58:49.984 --> 58:52.475
Yeah. Just in case
they wheel him in here...

58:52.687 --> 58:54.848
...one more goddamn time.
- Just in case.

58:55.056 --> 58:57.650
So you can lose your youth
stapling his parts back?

58:58.059 --> 59:01.495
I'm not a child.
And I rarely use staples on anybody.

59:02.096 --> 59:05.497
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- I know exactly what I'm doing.

59:05.700 --> 59:07.600
I'm giving him exactly what he needs.

59:07.802 --> 59:10.066
- He's using you.
- He needs me.

59:10.271 --> 59:13.365
I'm the only one who knows his body.

59:13.574 --> 59:15.235
How to treat him.

59:17.111 --> 59:20.569
Plenty of dames who know all about
his body, from what I hear.

59:20.781 --> 59:21.873
That's not what I meant.

59:22.083 --> 59:25.109
Plenty of broads he's stretched across
a gurney or what have you...

59:25.319 --> 59:26.581
...knowing just what to say.

59:26.787 --> 59:28.846
So this is why you came here tonight.

59:29.056 --> 59:31.115
Melting them like butter
with his fingers...

59:31.325 --> 59:32.587
That's enough.

59:33.227 --> 59:35.593
Don't make me ask you to leave.

59:37.531 --> 59:40.523
Honey, I don't know
how to talk about this stuff.

59:41.602 --> 59:43.763
You surely don't.

59:44.205 --> 59:48.574
Why do you think I spend my nights
knocking around that house all alone?

59:49.210 --> 59:51.474
Guess she had her reasons.

59:56.017 --> 59:58.417
You're married to your job.

59:58.819 --> 59:59.808
So am I.

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:02.583
So is he.

01:00:05.626 --> 01:00:09.062
You were so much happier
in the old days with Denny.

01:00:10.765 --> 01:00:12.198
Denny's dead.

01:00:13.801 --> 01:00:14.825
Yeah.

01:00:16.437 --> 01:00:18.064
Yeah, Denny Colt is dead.

01:00:18.272 --> 01:00:21.139
- Sweet kid.
- Yes, he was.

01:00:21.442 --> 01:00:24.377
And I'll never forget him
but we keep going.

01:00:26.681 --> 01:00:28.876
I lost my Boy Scout.

01:00:31.352 --> 01:00:34.185
Yeah. Yeah...

01:00:34.822 --> 01:00:37.120
...and I lost my little prom queen, huh?

01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:41.588
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

01:00:41.796 --> 01:00:44.390
I just hope that son of a bitch
knows how lucky he is.

01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:47.093
He doesn't.

01:00:56.744 --> 01:00:58.905
<i>I can feel you.</i>

01:00:59.113 --> 01:01:01.172
<i>You're so weary.</i>

01:01:01.382 --> 01:01:05.876
<i>Let me hold you.</i>

01:01:09.256 --> 01:01:10.951
What smells dental?

01:01:15.496 --> 01:01:17.828
Dental and Nazi.

01:01:18.032 --> 01:01:19.260
Great.

01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:22.763
Oh, no.

01:01:26.974 --> 01:01:29.101
Oh, brother.

01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:39.480
I've known some pretty strange women
in my time, some darn strange women.

01:01:39.687 --> 01:01:41.052
But this one...

01:01:41.255 --> 01:01:44.986
...if she is who I think she is,
she's got the final word on strange.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.539
I am Plaster. Plaster of Paris.

01:02:19.493 --> 01:02:21.324
I will stick to my man.

01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:28.259
Till death do us part.

01:02:34.408 --> 01:02:36.000
Death.

01:02:37.978 --> 01:02:40.538
Death. Death, death.

01:02:42.249 --> 01:02:45.241
It's just about all we think about,
isn't it?

01:02:45.653 --> 01:02:47.120
We eat...

01:02:47.321 --> 01:02:48.549
...so we won't die.

01:02:48.756 --> 01:02:52.283
We mate so that
our seed will live on.

01:02:52.493 --> 01:02:54.961
Create art and build skyscrapers...

01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:58.859
...so that our names
will be remembered for centuries.

01:03:07.374 --> 01:03:11.071
Mr. Long, my good friend,
how are you?

01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:13.269
What can I do for you?

01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:14.573
A message?

01:03:14.782 --> 01:03:17.148
And from whom would that be?

01:03:18.252 --> 01:03:21.585
Sand Saref. Oh, yes, I know her.

01:03:21.856 --> 01:03:24.825
Well, you should've known better
than to play cards with her.

01:03:25.025 --> 01:03:27.118
And what would her message be?

01:03:27.495 --> 01:03:29.292
The projects?

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:31.427
Out off that old main drag, oh.

01:03:31.632 --> 01:03:34.066
Hell, yeah, I know it.

01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:35.326
Tomorrow night, then.

01:03:35.836 --> 01:03:37.497
Let's say...

01:03:37.705 --> 01:03:39.570
...after dinner.

01:03:40.341 --> 01:03:42.673
<i>Zai jian,</i> my honored friend.

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:47.581
- Where was I?
- Death.

01:03:47.781 --> 01:03:48.873
Death, yes.

01:03:50.818 --> 01:03:52.945
We live our short...

01:03:53.154 --> 01:03:56.282
...frantic, fearful lives,
twisting this way and that.

01:03:57.491 --> 01:03:59.254
Music and ambition.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.453
Making up gods, afterlives,
all to keep our eyes off...

01:04:03.664 --> 01:04:07.327
...that immovable, impassable,
diamond-hard retaining wall...

01:04:07.535 --> 01:04:12.370
...that is death,
realizing it will splatter our brains...

01:04:12.706 --> 01:04:13.934
...like eggs.

01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:16.302
Pardon me,
but is there a point to all this?

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:19.206
Because I'm getting old
just listening to you.

01:04:19.914 --> 01:04:22.474
Man, you are really thick.

01:04:22.783 --> 01:04:26.219
You just don't get it.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.321
We're two of a kind, you and me.

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.551
Ain't neither one of us getting old.

01:04:31.759 --> 01:04:34.557
Well, I sure as heck can get bored.

01:04:36.564 --> 01:04:39.658
You keep teasing about
how we're two of a kind.

01:04:39.867 --> 01:04:41.858
So how's that?

01:04:42.336 --> 01:04:44.167
What are we, Octopus?

01:04:44.371 --> 01:04:46.134
I'm getting to that.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.568
Well, move it along.

01:04:47.775 --> 01:04:50.300
Do you remember your death,
pretty boy?

01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:52.411
Not the sort of thing a guy forgets.

01:05:00.154 --> 01:05:01.451
Yeah, I remember.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:12.062
When they wheeled you in,
you were stone-cold dead.

01:05:12.266 --> 01:05:14.791
<i>Not a breath of life in you.</i>

01:05:16.003 --> 01:05:17.971
<i>You were perfect.</i>

01:05:18.806 --> 01:05:21.832
<i>Dead as</i> Star Trek.

01:05:22.042 --> 01:05:25.478
<i>And I was your coroner.</i>

01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:30.548
<i>But I was, oh, so much, much</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

01:05:30.751 --> 01:05:32.480
I'd built up a righteous drug trade.

01:05:32.686 --> 01:05:35.154
It's amazing how much a hospital
doesn't miss.

01:05:35.356 --> 01:05:38.951
All you have to do is water it down,
spruce it up and <i>achtung.</i>

01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:40.148
Swiss bank accounts.

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:43.121
But mere money was never
what The Octopus was after.

01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:47.128
All right, so I give up.
What were you after?

01:05:48.135 --> 01:05:50.797
lmmortality.

01:05:51.005 --> 01:05:53.838
All five sweet syllables of it.

01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:56.441
There had to be a better way
to keep someone alive...

01:05:56.644 --> 01:05:59.511
...other than cutting them open
like some free-range chicken.

01:05:59.713 --> 01:06:02.773
Free-range chickens with their big,
brown, ugly-ass eggs.

01:06:02.983 --> 01:06:03.972
They piss me off.

01:06:04.184 --> 01:06:08.382
Every time I think about those big,
brown eggs, they piss me off.

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:11.114
Or pills.
They're just another way to stall death.

01:06:11.325 --> 01:06:13.350
Cling on for a heartbeat.
Hardly the answer.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.528
- I got down to basics.
- The essence of life.

01:06:15.729 --> 01:06:16.889
- I cracked code.
- Genetics.

01:06:17.097 --> 01:06:20.533
- That's how smart I am.
- Yeah, you're a real smart fella.

01:06:20.734 --> 01:06:22.929
Thank you. But it wasn't that easy.

01:06:23.137 --> 01:06:25.731
And I've got a freezer
full of stray beagles to prove it.

01:06:25.939 --> 01:06:29.636
Oh, what that serum did
to those poor dogs...

01:06:29.843 --> 01:06:31.572
...was just plain wrong.

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:35.207
But when I got it right,
well, I had to try it out.

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:38.715
I wasn't about to try it on myself.
I might've come out looking funny.

01:06:38.919 --> 01:06:40.614
I needed a human.

01:06:40.821 --> 01:06:42.379
And there I was.

01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:44.352
And there you was.

01:06:44.558 --> 01:06:47.618
I gave you a modest injection
and I waited.

01:07:01.575 --> 01:07:04.373
<i>Your second life</i>
<i>began that very night.</i>

01:07:04.578 --> 01:07:05.909
<i>Do you remember?</i>

01:07:10.951 --> 01:07:12.714
Oh, yeah, I remember.

01:07:15.556 --> 01:07:17.615
<i>Somewhere in the midst</i>
<i>of all that praying...</i>

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:19.383
<i>... and whimpering and sniveling...</i>

01:07:19.593 --> 01:07:22.460
<i>... you must have found</i>
<i>something sharp.</i>

01:07:37.378 --> 01:07:39.539
You know, I always wanted to ask:

01:07:39.747 --> 01:07:41.738
Where did you go when you got out?

01:07:43.117 --> 01:07:45.449
I took a walk.

01:07:49.223 --> 01:07:52.124
<i>I had myself a think.</i>

01:07:54.561 --> 01:07:56.324
<i>I visited an old friend.</i>

01:07:56.530 --> 01:08:00.523
I don't know what happened,
but I still move, I still breathe.

01:08:00.734 --> 01:08:03.168
It's impossible, but I'm still alive.

01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:06.132
All my life, all I wanted to be
was a good cop.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.171
That's all changed.
Everything's changed.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:10.969
They're winning, sir.
The bad guys are winning.

01:08:11.178 --> 01:08:14.170
I think I've got something more
to fight back with now.

01:08:14.581 --> 01:08:17.243
I'm something else now.

01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:20.045
I can go places, I can do things
they won't let cops do.

01:08:20.254 --> 01:08:23.814
But I can't have any weaknesses.
No name. No friends.

01:08:24.024 --> 01:08:26.015
I have to stay dead
in everybody's eyes.

01:08:26.693 --> 01:08:28.388
Even Ellen's.

01:08:28.929 --> 01:08:30.487
But I could be your spy.

01:08:30.997 --> 01:08:33.158
I could work with your men.

01:08:33.367 --> 01:08:36.234
Behind them, in the shadows.

01:08:36.437 --> 01:08:40.372
I could be
the city's protector, its... Its...

01:08:41.308 --> 01:08:42.832
Its spirit.

01:08:44.077 --> 01:08:46.875
Exit hero cop, enter The Spirit.

01:08:47.314 --> 01:08:50.180
Pain in the ass. Tough as nails.

01:08:50.384 --> 01:08:53.410
Eureka!

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:58.185
So I shot myself up, and we became
brothers under the skin.

01:08:58.392 --> 01:09:01.589
So, what the hell are we, Octopus?

01:09:02.129 --> 01:09:03.993
You're works in progress.

01:09:04.331 --> 01:09:06.890
And once he has the vase
and its contents...

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.365
...its mystic contents,
lost over millennia...

01:09:10.571 --> 01:09:12.937
...he'll drink of it
and he'll become immortal.

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.040
Don't tease.

01:09:15.242 --> 01:09:18.075
Seeing as how I'm gonna die anyway,
clue me in.

01:09:18.278 --> 01:09:19.939
What's in the vase?

01:09:20.147 --> 01:09:22.513
- Thor's hammer?
- No.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.247
Better.

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:26.578
The DNA...

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:29.813
...of a god.
- Not a god. Not exactly.

01:09:30.023 --> 01:09:33.925
Yeah, because, you know, humans
and gods, well, they don't mix very well.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:38.359
The only route to take is to find the
connection between man and god...

01:09:38.564 --> 01:09:40.692
...the child of an immortal
and a human.

01:09:40.901 --> 01:09:44.837
See, Zeus couldn't keep it in his pants,
so he made bags and bags of heroes.

01:09:45.037 --> 01:09:47.370
Now, the greatest of them all
was Heracles.

01:09:47.573 --> 01:09:49.701
And we found his ass.

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:52.435
Well, his blood anyway.
He left some blood around.

01:09:52.645 --> 01:09:53.943
And we know where it is.

01:09:54.147 --> 01:09:58.777
So that's the missing link
between science and magic.

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:03.286
Now, once Heracles' blood mixes
with Octopus' formula <i>...</i>

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:06.584
- I become a god.
- Or the next best thing.

01:10:06.793 --> 01:10:08.624
I become a god.

01:10:08.829 --> 01:10:11.821
And you'll be just one more
sad little byproduct.

01:10:12.332 --> 01:10:14.266
One of his many, many, many failures.

01:10:14.635 --> 01:10:17.103
Come on, now.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

01:10:17.838 --> 01:10:21.467
Besides, look at all the lovely buddies
I've made along the way.

01:10:21.675 --> 01:10:22.664
We was easy to make.

01:10:22.876 --> 01:10:24.707
Yeah, the boss says
we was easy to make.

01:10:24.912 --> 01:10:26.971
But your failures were several.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.478
And unpleasant.

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:32.986
Yeah, you know,
you get so much as one little drop...

01:10:33.186 --> 01:10:35.654
...the wrong temperature,
and everything just...

01:10:36.223 --> 01:10:37.815
Let me show you.

01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:40.021
It's kind of sad...

01:10:40.227 --> 01:10:42.627
...but it's really kind of cool too.

01:10:42.829 --> 01:10:44.091
This is Muffin.

01:10:45.365 --> 01:10:47.196
She's my favorite.

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:17.625
We have to have people over
more often.

01:11:17.831 --> 01:11:19.355
I like this.

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:25.595
The cat.

01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:31.109
She is all the reason I need.

01:11:31.445 --> 01:11:32.742
I will kill you.

01:11:34.014 --> 01:11:37.381
- Oh, no, you have to die, Spirit.
- Yeah, because you got the juice, man.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:41.020
Your system's been prepared.
You're the only one the blood won't kill.

01:11:41.221 --> 01:11:43.587
One sip and you could be rendered
as immortal as he.

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.382
The Octopus can be the only one.

01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:47.958
There can be no competition
once he's world ruler.

01:11:48.161 --> 01:11:50.391
Yes, then everyone
will have to do what I say.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:56.035
They will all have to do what I say
because I will be the ruler of the world.

01:11:56.236 --> 01:11:58.500
Then everything
will start to make sense.

01:11:58.705 --> 01:12:00.673
Yes, everything will make sense.

01:12:00.874 --> 01:12:03.342
Everything will start to make sense.

01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:06.106
Let's get back to business.

01:12:06.313 --> 01:12:07.678
Yes, back to business.

01:12:08.815 --> 01:12:10.373
Back to killing your ass.

01:12:11.451 --> 01:12:14.249
Now, here's where things
become a little tricky.

01:12:14.454 --> 01:12:16.217
It's all about integration.

01:12:16.423 --> 01:12:19.051
Now, in your current state,
you heal very quickly.

01:12:19.259 --> 01:12:21.250
Your wounds mend in moments.

01:12:21.461 --> 01:12:25.727
The only solution, it turns out, is to
affect your systemic disintegration.

01:12:25.932 --> 01:12:27.832
In short...

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:33.197
...to render you into
so many different parts spread so far...

01:12:33.407 --> 01:12:36.069
...that reintegration
would be impossible.

01:12:37.711 --> 01:12:39.770
And being the man that I am...

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:44.246
...I like to start from the bottom
and work my way up.

01:12:44.451 --> 01:12:47.386
Floss, bring me those bags.

01:12:52.426 --> 01:12:55.486
I'm going to mail your ass
all over the country.

01:12:56.697 --> 01:12:58.255
Plaster...

01:12:58.465 --> 01:12:59.625
...bring me his toes.

01:13:03.537 --> 01:13:04.936
Plaster.

01:13:19.052 --> 01:13:20.451
Enough of this frog talk.

01:13:20.654 --> 01:13:21.814
I don't understand it.

01:13:23.123 --> 01:13:24.488
Paris...

01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:26.750
...give me his toes.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.451
That's an order.

01:13:33.734 --> 01:13:34.928
I hate you.

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:44.173
This is for Sand.

01:13:45.679 --> 01:13:46.839
This is for me.

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:49.641
And this one's for Muffin.

01:13:57.657 --> 01:13:59.454
That all you got?

01:14:06.666 --> 01:14:08.224
Who is this Sand?

01:14:09.603 --> 01:14:11.969
Not now. Let's go.

01:14:34.394 --> 01:14:36.123
The Spirit.

01:14:36.596 --> 01:14:38.257
Plaster.

01:14:50.377 --> 01:14:53.278
And this is for Sand.

01:14:58.251 --> 01:15:01.618
I am Plaster of Paris.

01:15:02.222 --> 01:15:05.157
The toast of Montmartre.

01:15:06.226 --> 01:15:08.285
I will stick to my man.

01:15:08.495 --> 01:15:10.759
Till death do us part.

01:15:16.036 --> 01:15:18.402
<i>You're close now.</i>

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:21.899
<i>Very, very close.</i>

01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:32.284
<i>You can't fight me.</i>

01:15:32.485 --> 01:15:35.113
<i>You. You are mine. Mine. Mine.</i>

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.671
Hey, man, I know the feeling.

01:15:55.876 --> 01:15:58.310
You should meet my wife.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:03.775
Just put one foot in front of the other.

01:16:35.849 --> 01:16:38.545
<i>Here we go again.</i>

01:16:39.419 --> 01:16:41.819
<i>I'm dead again.</i>

01:16:44.457 --> 01:16:47.051
<i>The fight's gone out of me.</i>

01:16:50.263 --> 01:16:52.128
<i>I'm ready for you, Lorelei.</i>

01:16:52.332 --> 01:16:53.856
<i>Come.</i>

01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:56.661
<i>Come. Come. Come.</i>

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:58.269
<i>Come.</i>

01:16:58.471 --> 01:17:00.632
<i>It is time.</i>

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:02.966
<i>Come. Come.</i>

01:17:03.643 --> 01:17:06.009
<i>No more pain.</i>

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:08.813
<i>No more suffering.</i>

01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:13.112
<i>Give up the last of it, Denny.</i>

01:17:15.455 --> 01:17:17.855
<i>Give up the ghost.</i>

01:17:18.992 --> 01:17:20.653
<i>Give up the spirit.</i>

01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:23.086
<i>Yes, my darling. Yes.</i>

01:17:43.817 --> 01:17:45.250
<i>No.</i>

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.519
<i>It is done.</i>

01:17:48.722 --> 01:17:51.316
<i>It is done. It is done.</i>

01:17:51.524 --> 01:17:53.492
<i>What's it they say about</i>
<i>when you die...</i>

01:17:53.693 --> 01:17:56.093
<i>... about your whole life</i>
<i>flashing before your eyes?</i>

01:17:56.296 --> 01:17:57.558
<i>Forget all that.</i>

01:17:57.764 --> 01:17:59.254
<i>All I see are women.</i>

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:04.301
<i>My sweet Ellen, always there to put</i>
<i>my ragged pieces back together.</i>

01:18:04.504 --> 01:18:06.472
<i>And Sand.</i>

01:18:07.107 --> 01:18:08.870
<i>That poor lost soul.</i>

01:18:11.044 --> 01:18:14.445
<i>Beautiful, beautiful Sand.</i>

01:18:23.456 --> 01:18:27.324
<i>It's so funny my last thought</i>
<i>would be of Sand.</i>

01:18:35.969 --> 01:18:37.732
<i>No.</i>

01:18:37.937 --> 01:18:40.201
<i>Lorelei, you're not for me just yet.</i>

01:18:40.407 --> 01:18:42.671
<i>No, not again.</i>

01:18:42.876 --> 01:18:45.208
<i>They need me. I gotta go back.</i>

01:18:45.412 --> 01:18:48.210
<i>I will always be with you, Denny Colt.</i>

01:18:48.415 --> 01:18:51.407
<i>You won't escape me forever.</i>

01:18:51.885 --> 01:18:54.080
<i>They need me.</i>

01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:26.482
Sand...

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.344
...at the projects.

01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:32.320
Octopus.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.755
Pieces.

01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:39.395
Pieces of Sand.

01:19:42.535 --> 01:19:44.002
Pieces.

01:19:44.204 --> 01:19:45.967
Pieces of Octopus.

01:19:46.172 --> 01:19:48.003
You son of a bitch, Octopus.
You're mine.

01:19:48.208 --> 01:19:49.402
Always with The Octopus.

01:19:49.609 --> 01:19:52.043
- Excuse me, but wasn't he, like...?
- Not right now.

01:19:52.245 --> 01:19:55.146
But three hours with no vitals.
Shouldn't he ought to be dead?

01:19:55.348 --> 01:19:56.542
It's a long story.

01:19:56.749 --> 01:19:59.445
Somebody get me a tie.
And it sure as hell better be red.

01:19:59.652 --> 01:20:02.052
- This time, you better know your place.
- Hold on.

01:20:02.255 --> 01:20:04.553
You're supposed to be my spy,
not some vigilante.

01:20:04.757 --> 01:20:08.022
If you go all cowboy on me again,
I am gonna blast you in half myself.

01:20:08.228 --> 01:20:10.219
- You got that?
- I got an idea.

01:20:10.563 --> 01:20:13.464
- I'm atwitter.
- No, it's good.

01:20:13.666 --> 01:20:14.894
I promise.

01:20:20.673 --> 01:20:24.439
Hey, you keep that thing pointed
at The Octopus.

01:20:24.644 --> 01:20:26.839
When I give you the word,
you blow his head off.

01:20:27.046 --> 01:20:29.742
Then it's on with our wedding night,
huh, baby?

01:20:29.949 --> 01:20:32.679
Yeah, baby. Our wedding night.

01:21:25.772 --> 01:21:27.501
Who the hell are you?

01:21:27.707 --> 01:21:30.938
- You The Octopus' girlfriend?
- Oh, no, it's not like that.

01:21:31.978 --> 01:21:33.741
- I mean, this is fun for me.
- Fun?

01:21:33.947 --> 01:21:36.472
We show up here,
we look fabulous doing it...

01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:38.310
...we swap things, then we leave.

01:21:38.518 --> 01:21:41.715
- You're looking to get yourself killed.
- Would you lighten up?

01:21:41.921 --> 01:21:43.650
- Should we start shooting?
- Don't know.

01:21:43.856 --> 01:21:45.824
- No shooting.
- No shooting, you polyp.

01:21:46.226 --> 01:21:48.387
No sign of The Octopus.

01:21:48.595 --> 01:21:51.257
Hell of a waste of time
if he didn't show up.

01:21:51.464 --> 01:21:55.958
Whenever he does, sir,
we are locked and loaded.

01:21:56.169 --> 01:21:58.137
That cannon could take out the moon,
rookie.

01:21:58.438 --> 01:21:59.735
Sir, I'm an excellent shot.

01:21:59.939 --> 01:22:02.203
Is every goddamn woman
in this goddamn hellhole...

01:22:02.408 --> 01:22:06.105
...out of her goddamn mind?
- No, sir, we're just equipped.

01:22:06.312 --> 01:22:08.177
Sweetie, he's just using you.

01:22:08.381 --> 01:22:12.681
Sure he is. I run a very lucrative
operation and I'm great eye candy.

01:22:12.885 --> 01:22:15.319
I walk away,
I have my Ph.D. all paid for.

01:22:15.521 --> 01:22:17.887
Fine. Tell lug nuts over there
to give me the box.

01:22:18.091 --> 01:22:20.559
And you, you start that walking.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.388
As far away from that animal
as you possibly can.

01:22:23.596 --> 01:22:26.963
He will kill you. He kills everything.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.894
All right, fine. I just think you're taking
this way too seriously, that's all.

01:23:11.477 --> 01:23:13.411
Give them the vase.

01:23:21.721 --> 01:23:23.586
Boss said I start shooting now.

01:23:28.294 --> 01:23:29.955
Get in the truck.

01:23:33.666 --> 01:23:35.258
Nobody goes anywhere.

01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:37.966
Floss...

01:23:38.171 --> 01:23:39.832
...fetch me that vase, please.

01:23:40.039 --> 01:23:41.063
Get in the truck.

01:23:41.507 --> 01:23:45.136
Give me the blood of Heracles, now.

01:23:45.345 --> 01:23:46.607
Walk.

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:47.871
Heracles?

01:23:50.283 --> 01:23:52.615
I always thought it was "Hercules."

01:23:53.886 --> 01:23:55.513
You.

01:24:15.942 --> 01:24:19.070
Sand, you found your armor.

01:24:19.278 --> 01:24:20.575
Use it.

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.145
What is it with you and women?

01:24:26.018 --> 01:24:27.849
Octopus...

01:24:28.054 --> 01:24:29.817
...you were right.

01:24:30.022 --> 01:24:31.614
We're mistakes.

01:24:31.824 --> 01:24:33.416
We never should have happened.

01:24:45.738 --> 01:24:47.706
- Sir, this is crazy.
- Hold your horses.

01:24:47.907 --> 01:24:50.205
He doesn't want any cops
getting killed.

01:24:54.447 --> 01:24:57.041
You're not making this easy.

01:25:04.424 --> 01:25:05.550
Come on, kid.

01:25:15.601 --> 01:25:17.330
It ends tonight.

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:20.167
You got that right.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.301
I'm The Octopus.

01:25:22.508 --> 01:25:23.873
I got eight of everything.

01:25:46.566 --> 01:25:48.659
There's shot to hell.

01:25:48.868 --> 01:25:50.495
And shot to hell.

01:25:51.237 --> 01:25:54.035
And there's just plain ridiculous.

01:25:54.507 --> 01:25:56.304
Now.

01:26:16.496 --> 01:26:18.054
You idiot, Octopus.

01:26:18.264 --> 01:26:21.756
All we needed was to flush you
and your gunsels out.

01:26:25.805 --> 01:26:27.466
Move, move.

01:26:33.012 --> 01:26:34.411
Give it to him, boys.

01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:37.372
Commissioner Dolan,
your daughter's here.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:40.307
We need more men over there.

01:27:40.513 --> 01:27:43.277
- Baby, you don't wanna be here.
- You're joking, right, Daddy?

01:27:43.482 --> 01:27:46.212
Have you forgotten what I do
for a living? He might need me.

01:27:46.419 --> 01:27:48.649
You'll be in his way,
he doesn't want you here.

01:27:48.854 --> 01:27:50.014
You don't know that.

01:27:50.222 --> 01:27:53.521
You don't know him.
You don't know a damn thing.

01:27:53.726 --> 01:27:55.489
Stop her. Pull her back.

01:27:55.861 --> 01:27:56.953
Yes, sir.

01:28:02.702 --> 01:28:04.533
Runny eggs.

01:28:16.782 --> 01:28:19.273
Finally. Yes.

01:28:19.485 --> 01:28:20.509
Yes.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.451
Yeah!

01:28:33.799 --> 01:28:35.164
Wha...?

01:28:40.873 --> 01:28:42.898
Nice investment, Sand.

01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:44.701
Passes its first field test.

01:28:52.284 --> 01:28:53.512
Let's die.

01:29:03.896 --> 01:29:06.023
Oh, God. Oh, God, no.

01:29:06.899 --> 01:29:08.389
No. Oh, God.

01:29:10.569 --> 01:29:11.900
Mother.

01:29:39.298 --> 01:29:41.789
I guess it's time
to finally drop your armor, Sand.

01:29:46.238 --> 01:29:48.331
You lost something.

01:29:52.111 --> 01:29:54.511
Old man Kurtzman said
he'd take it back.

01:29:59.985 --> 01:30:01.418
Well...

01:30:02.421 --> 01:30:04.446
...maybe I'll wear it now and then.

01:30:04.657 --> 01:30:06.921
But it doesn't mean I'm your girl.

01:30:45.598 --> 01:30:48.362
Ellen. Ellen, are you all right?

01:31:18.597 --> 01:31:19.825
Goodbye, Sand.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.063
Goodbye, Denny.

01:31:47.193 --> 01:31:48.990
Goodbye, Spirit.

01:31:52.565 --> 01:31:54.465
- Is that Saref?
- Give me this one, Dolan.

01:31:54.667 --> 01:31:55.895
Just let her go.

01:31:56.101 --> 01:31:58.797
She saved me.
She saved the world.

01:31:59.004 --> 01:32:02.167
Yeah, well,
you had something to do with it.

01:32:02.374 --> 01:32:04.842
All right. All right.
Just stay out of my face.

01:32:10.683 --> 01:32:13.277
So who the hell was that back there?
Who is she?

01:32:13.485 --> 01:32:14.747
Just an old flame.

01:32:14.954 --> 01:32:16.922
Yeah, she looks old.

01:32:17.122 --> 01:32:19.886
- It's you I love, baby. With all my heart.
- Yeah.

01:32:20.092 --> 01:32:22.356
Me and every other woman
you meet.

01:32:23.662 --> 01:32:26.130
You are amazing.

01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:27.924
Neat work yourself, rookie.

01:32:30.369 --> 01:32:32.269
Bastard.

01:32:57.129 --> 01:32:59.495
We start from scratch.

01:33:08.774 --> 01:33:11.004
Who knows what I'll do?

01:33:18.751 --> 01:33:21.948
<i>She wakes. Grouchy as always.</i>

01:33:23.188 --> 01:33:25.156
<i>Endlessly noisy.</i>

01:33:26.158 --> 01:33:28.524
<i>Endlessly alive.</i>

01:33:29.495 --> 01:33:31.929
<i>She's all I really have.</i>

01:33:32.564 --> 01:33:34.828
<i>My only hope.</i>

01:33:35.634 --> 01:33:37.829
<i>My only constant.</i>

01:33:39.571 --> 01:33:41.971
<i>The secrets of The Octopus</i>
<i>died with him.</i>

01:33:44.677 --> 01:33:46.804
<i>I don't know what I am</i>
<i>or how long I got.</i>

01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:49.207
<i>Heck, maybe I'll live forever.</i>

01:33:49.415 --> 01:33:50.939
<i>I hope not.</i>

01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:53.015
<i>That's nothing any man</i>
<i>ought to have.</i>

01:33:53.218 --> 01:33:55.652
<i>That's nothing any man</i>
<i>ought to want.</i>

01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:58.819
<i>Denny Colt is dead.</i>
<i>I'm something else now...</i>

01:33:59.024 --> 01:34:01.959
<i>... and I can never give my heart</i>
<i>to anyone but her.</i>

01:34:02.161 --> 01:34:05.824
<i>She will always be mine</i>
<i>and I will always be hers.</i>

01:34:06.031 --> 01:34:08.727
<i>She owns me, body and soul.</i>

01:34:08.934 --> 01:34:11.528
<i>She is the love of my life.</i>

01:34:12.137 --> 01:34:14.401
<i>She is my city.</i>

01:34:16.408 --> 01:34:18.205
<i>And I...</i>

01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:20.740
<i>... am her Spirit.</i>
