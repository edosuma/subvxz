WEBVTT

00:20.400 --> 00:22.700
LOOK, PEOPLE ARE
LINING UP TO GET IN.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.600
THAT'S RIGHT, FATHER.
CUSTOMERS ARE A-LINING UP--

00:25.600 --> 00:27.033
LINING UP BECAUSE
ERIC MATTHEWS

00:27.033 --> 00:29.700
CALLED A LITTLE LADY
NAMED HOLLY WOOD

00:29.700 --> 00:31.000
AND ARRANGED FOR
ALL THESE NICE PEOPLE

00:31.000 --> 00:32.767
TO MEET TV's BEAR.

00:34.934 --> 00:35.934
UM...

00:35.934 --> 00:37.600
WHAT SHOW
WAS HE ON AGAIN?

00:37.600 --> 00:38.934
OH, UH, I DON'T KNOW,

00:38.934 --> 00:41.200
<i>GRIZZLY ADAMS, GENTLE BEN,</i>
<i>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC--</i>

00:41.200 --> 00:43.300
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
SEE, THIS BEAR'S BEEN ON TV.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.867
HE'S FAMOUS.
PEOPLE LOVE THAT.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.000
EXCUSE ME, MR. MATTHEWS.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.400
I'D LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF
THE BUSINESS END UP-FRONT.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.000
OH, YEAH, WELL,

00:54.000 --> 00:58.100
WHAT DID MY PARTNER
AND, UH, MISS HOLLY WOOD
AGREE ON?

00:58.100 --> 01:00.066
$2,500.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.867
THAT'S
A LOT OF MONEY.

01:01.867 --> 01:04.700
WELL, IT'S NOT
JUST ANY BEAR.
IT'S A TV BEAR.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.867
WELL, I MEAN, THERE ARE
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE,

01:06.867 --> 01:10.000
AND IF EVERYBODY LEAVES
WITH A PAIR OF SOCKS,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.300
I GUESS WE'RE OK.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.834
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
THE--THE PLAN ISN'T TO HAVE

01:13.834 --> 01:15.934
THOSE PEOPLE
COME IN HERE, IS IT?

01:15.934 --> 01:18.600
WELL, YEAH,
THAT'S THE--THE WHOLE
POINT OF THE PLAN

01:18.600 --> 01:20.300
IS HAVE ALL THOSE PEOPLE
COME IN HERE,

01:20.300 --> 01:21.967
MEET THE TV BEAR,

01:21.967 --> 01:25.133
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
BUY STUFF.
BUY LOTS OF STUFF.

01:25.133 --> 01:26.500
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.400
YOU SEE, THIS--THIS BEAR
CAN'T BE AROUND PEOPLE.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.200
THAT'S A TV BEAR.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.400
ISN'T IT TRAINED?

01:32.400 --> 01:34.133
YOU CAN'T TRAIN A BEAR.

01:37.033 --> 01:38.967
ERIC, $2,500.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.300
FIX THIS. NOW.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.567
OK.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.934
OK, I HAPPEN TO HAVE
SEEN THIS VERY BEAR

01:44.934 --> 01:47.100
ON AN EPISODE
OF<i>LITTLE HOUSE</i>
<i>ON THE PRAIRIE.</i>

01:47.100 --> 01:49.934
WELL, SURE, HE'S GREAT
WITH LITTLE CHILDREN.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.734
OK, FINE, THEN WE CAN
HAVE THE LITTLE CHILDREN
COME IN

01:54.734 --> 01:55.900
AND PLAY WITH THE BEAR.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.500
OH, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.100
DIDN'T YOUR PARTNER
FILL YOU IN ON
ANY OF THE PARTICULARS?

02:02.100 --> 02:04.400
NO.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.500
NO, HE DIDN'T.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.233
WELL, FIRST, WE NEED
ANOTHER $2,500

02:08.233 --> 02:09.367
FOR THE FEMALE BEAR.

02:11.367 --> 02:12.900
ERIC...

02:12.900 --> 02:15.767
YOU COST ME 5 GRAND.

02:15.767 --> 02:18.000
YEAH, BUT, DAD,
LOOK, I MEAN,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.367
WE GOT A BEAR.

02:20.367 --> 02:22.300
IT'S A GENTLE, MEEK...

02:22.300 --> 02:23.900
TV BEAR.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.233
AAH!

02:31.233 --> 02:32.233
AAH!
AAH!

02:35.734 --> 02:38.600
NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.300
Trainer:
RALPH, NO. NO, DOWN.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.734
ERIC...

02:41.734 --> 02:42.800
GET OUT OF HERE.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.367
EASY, RALPH!
WHY? I WORK HERE.

02:44.367 --> 02:46.500
NOT ANYMORE.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
NOT THE SHOE!
HEEL! OW!

02:50.400 --> 02:52.200
ALAN, THIS ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME

02:52.200 --> 02:53.834
ERIC HAS MESSED UP
AT THE STORE.

02:53.834 --> 02:56.300
YOU'VE GIVEN HIM
ENOUGH CHANCES.
YOU HAD TO LET HIM GO.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.033
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT I DID, AMY.
I LET HIM GO.

02:59.033 --> 03:02.233
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LET ERIC GO.
I LOVE ERIC.

03:02.233 --> 03:05.200
NO, SWEETIE, HE'S NOT
LEAVING THE HOUSE.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.200
I JUST FIRED HIM
FROM WORK.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.300
WOULD YOU EVER
FIRE ME, DAD?

03:09.300 --> 03:11.867
OH, NEVER, PRINCESS.

03:11.867 --> 03:14.000
I JUST HOPE ERIC
UNDERSTOOD YOU.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.467
I MEAN, HE KNOWS
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM.

03:15.467 --> 03:17.834
YOU WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO HURT HIM,

03:17.834 --> 03:19.734
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
CALLED TOUGH LOVE,

03:19.734 --> 03:21.567
AND HE HAS TO LEARN
HIS LESSON.

03:21.567 --> 03:22.834
WELL, AMY, I WAS TOUGH.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.467
I MADE IT VERY CLEAR
TO HIM HE WAS FIRED.

03:25.467 --> 03:28.367
COME ON, DADDY-O, GOT
TO GET TO WORK EARLY,
GET OUT THAT BEAR STINK.

03:28.367 --> 03:31.734
ERIC, ARE YOU
GOING TO WORK?

03:31.734 --> 03:33.400
UH, MOM, YEAH.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.133
PUT A LITTLE FOOD
ON THE TABLE, KEEP YOU
IN PRETTY THINGS.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.500
LET'S GO, POPS.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.233
OH, ONE THING.
ONE THING,
BEFORE I FORGET.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.000
I GOT TO TAKE
AN EARLY LUNCH AND THEN
NOT COME BACK AT ALL,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.133
BECAUSE I MET
A REALLY NICE GIRL

03:43.133 --> 03:45.300
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE
A SECOND LUNCH WITH HER.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.700
WORKING FOR YOUR DAD
IS SO GREAT.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.000
ERIC, YOU'RE FIRED.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.100
UH, YEAH, CAME UP.
LET'S GO, POPS.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.734
NO, ERIC, I'M SERIOUS.

03:51.734 --> 03:52.867
YOU'RE FIRED.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.834
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME.

03:55.834 --> 03:59.300
YOU'RE THE MAMA.
I WORK FOR THE DADA.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.300
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, DADA?

04:01.834 --> 04:02.934
DADDY?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.100
DA?

04:09.900 --> 04:11.967
YOU REALLY DON'T
HELP YOURSELF, PAL.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.033
HERE.

04:20.033 --> 04:21.834
WHAT'S THIS?
IT'S A--

04:21.834 --> 04:23.000
IT'S A LIST
OF COLLEGES.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.934
YES, THAT IS WHERE I WANT
YOU AND TOPANGA TO GO.

04:24.934 --> 04:26.133
EVEN IF I'M NOT
GOING TO SCHOOL,

04:26.133 --> 04:27.500
THE THREE OF US
SHOULD STILL BE TOGETHER.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.700
OK, "UNIVERSITY
OF ITALY."

04:31.567 --> 04:33.767
GOOD OLD
"U" OF IT.
YEP...

04:33.767 --> 04:35.500
YOU GUYS HIT THE BOOKS.
YOU'RE STUDYING HARD.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.600
MEANWHILE,
I'M OUT IN THE SUN

04:36.600 --> 04:39.834
TAKING TOURISTS AROUND
IN MY BIG CANOE.

04:39.834 --> 04:41.200
IT'S CALLED A GONDOLA.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.734
AND THAT IS WHY
YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.367
WAIT, SHAWN, SHAWN,
SHAWN, SHAWN.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.000
YOU'VE WORKED TOO LONG
TO THROW IT ALL AWAY
NOW, OK, BUDDY?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.200
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE S.A.T.s? I BET
YOU'LL DO REALLY WELL.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.734
FINE, FINE, I'LL TAKE
YOUR LITTLE TEST.

04:51.734 --> 04:53.734
WHAT'S 10 MINUTES
OF MY LIFE, RIGHT?

04:53.734 --> 04:57.367
10 MINUTES? SHAWN,
THEY TAKE AT LEAST--

04:57.367 --> 04:59.033
SHAWN, LISTEN.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.667
YOU KNOW, I BET
IF YOU TAKE FEENY'S
REVIEW COURSE,

05:00.667 --> 05:03.300
I BET YOU COULD
KNOCK THEM OUT
IN 5, SLUGGER.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.967
NO. TOO MUCH SCHOOL,
TOO MUCH FEENY. BYE-BYE.

05:06.967 --> 05:08.900
I AM GOING
CANOE SHOPPING.

05:08.900 --> 05:12.500
THERE ARE SO MANY TIMES
I SHOULD'VE FIRED ERIC,
BUT I DIDN'T.

05:12.500 --> 05:16.200
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ADMITTING
THAT I WAS A LOUSY BOSS.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.133
OR WORSE, A LOUSY FATHER.

05:18.133 --> 05:21.000
OH, ALAN, HOW CAN YOU LOOK
AT CORY AND MORGAN

05:21.000 --> 05:23.133
AND THINK YOU'RE ANYTHING
BUT THE BEST FATHER?

05:23.133 --> 05:24.800
WELL, THEN WHY AM I
HAVING SUCH A DIFFICULT
TIME WITH ERIC?

05:24.800 --> 05:28.000
IT'S NOT LIKE
I DID ANYTHING
DIFFERENT WITH HIM.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.200
WE DID EVERYTHING
DIFFERENT.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.500
WE BOTH DID.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.500
I MEAN, HE'S
OUR FIRSTBORN CHILD.
WE CODDLED HIM.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.033
OH, I DIDN'T
CODDLE HIM.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.300
BUT ERIC'S VERY DIFFERENT
THAN CORY AND MORGAN.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.400
HE NEEDS
TO BE PROTECTED.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.800
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S
GOING TO HELP HIM?

05:45.100 --> 05:46.400
YES, I DO.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.934
YOU REALLY THINK THAT?

05:47.934 --> 05:49.100
YES.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.300
WOULD YOU BE
WILLING TO LISTEN

05:50.300 --> 05:53.600
TO SOMEONE ELSE'S
OPINION AND
NOT OVERREACT?

05:55.567 --> 05:57.133
ERIC IS LAZY.

05:57.133 --> 06:00.767
GEORGE, THAT'S MY SON
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.000
MOM.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.500
DAD.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.400
FEENY, YOU KNOW
THE REASON I SIGNED UP
FOR YOUR S.A.T. PREP COURSE

06:07.400 --> 06:09.000
IS TO PREP,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.867
POSSIBLY EVEN REVIEW.

06:10.867 --> 06:14.367
BUT YOU'VE GONE
WAY BEYOND THAT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

06:14.367 --> 06:16.867
TOO MUCH WORK FOR YOU,
MR. MATTHEWS?

06:16.867 --> 06:18.600
OH, I'LL DO IT.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.400
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU,
FEENY.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.934
YOU REMEMBER THAT WHILE
I'M IN THE KITCHEN WORKING

06:23.934 --> 06:24.934
AND WATCHING YOU.

06:27.033 --> 06:29.200
MOM, DAD.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.600
WE'LL TALK TO HIM.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.100
HE SHOULDN'T
TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.600
NO, NO, I LIKE
HIS DETERMINATION.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.934
CORY WORKS HARD
FOR HIS GRADES.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.100
AND ERIC?

06:42.100 --> 06:45.800
ERIC COULD GET
PASSING GRADES
IN HIS SLEEP.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.033
IN FACT, HE DID.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.600
WHICH IS A SHAME,

06:50.600 --> 06:51.967
BECAUSE I'D BE
HARD-PRESSED
TO COME UP WITH

06:51.967 --> 06:54.400
A HANDFUL OF STUDENTS
WHO ARE BRIGHTER,
WITTIER,

06:54.400 --> 06:56.767
OR SMARTER THAN ERIC.

06:56.767 --> 06:59.367
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT ERIC IS SMART?

06:59.367 --> 07:00.734
MM-HMM.

07:00.734 --> 07:02.233
GOOD.

07:02.233 --> 07:04.033
SEE, ALAN? NOW WE KNOW
WE HAVEN'T COME DOWN
TOO HARD ON HIM,

07:04.033 --> 07:07.400
AND HE IS CAPABLE OF
REACHING OUR EXPECTATIONS.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.567
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
IN A SECURITY GUARD COSTUME?

07:16.567 --> 07:18.000
IT'S NOT A COSTUME.
IT'S MY UNIFORM.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.800
I FINALLY FOUND MY CALLING:
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.000
YOU PROUD OF ME?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.367
YOU TOOK A JOB
AS A SECURITY GUARD?

07:24.367 --> 07:27.233
WHY WOULD YOU POSSIBLY
WANT TO DO THAT?

07:27.233 --> 07:29.100
OH, ONLY FOR
ABOUT 10 REASONS:

07:29.100 --> 07:30.967
1--WALKIE-TALKIE,
2--PARTNER,

07:30.967 --> 07:31.967
3--DOG, 4--PARTNER--

07:31.967 --> 07:33.100
SOMETIMES WE SWITCH
PARTNERS--

07:33.100 --> 07:35.700
5--YOU WANT ME
TO KEEP GOING?
6--I PACK HEAT.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.967
YOU CARRY A GUN?

07:37.967 --> 07:40.667
NOPE, A HEATER. IT GETS
COLD OUT THERE IN THE SHED.

07:40.667 --> 07:43.467
ERIC, YOU COULD DO
ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE.

07:43.467 --> 07:44.500
WAIT A SECOND.
I DON'T GET THIS.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
LOOK, YOU FIRE ME
FROM ONE JOB,

07:45.500 --> 07:46.600
I GO OUT,
I GET ANOTHER JOB.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.867
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
DAD, GET HER OFF MY BACK.

07:48.867 --> 07:50.133
NO, YOUR MOTHER IS RIGHT.

07:50.133 --> 07:52.200
WE ARE TIRED OF YOU
TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.600
FROM NOW ON,
THE FREE RIDE IS OVER.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.133
OH. OK, GOOD,
MOM GOT TO YOU, TOO.

07:56.133 --> 07:56.800
THAT'S GREAT,
THAT'S GREAT.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.200
HOW ABOUT YOU, MR. FEENY?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.700
AM I TAKING
THE EASY WAY OUT?

07:59.700 --> 08:01.233
OH, GOD,
NOT ANOTHER QUESTION.

08:02.834 --> 08:04.867
YES, ERIC, I DO.

08:04.867 --> 08:06.834
AH. GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.233
WELL, I'D LOVE TO STAY HERE
AND, YOU KNOW,
DEBATE WITH YOU GUYS,

08:09.233 --> 08:11.200
BUT I'M LATE FOR WORK.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.000
OH, AND ANOTHER THING.
DON'T WAIT UP
FOR ME TONIGHT.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.200
I WON'T BE COMING HOME.
I'M MOVING OUT.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.600
OK, HERE HE COMES.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.900
OK, CORY, GIVE ME
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
TOUGH S.A.T. QUESTIONS.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.300
OK, HERE'S A DOOZIE.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.000
KEPT ME UP
MOST OF THE NIGHT.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.400
"WHICH OF
THESE INGREDIENTS

08:37.400 --> 08:41.200
DOES<i>NOT </i>HELP YOU
MAKE MUD--"

08:41.200 --> 08:42.700
"DIRT...

08:42.700 --> 08:44.467
"WATER...

08:44.467 --> 08:46.767
OR TURKEY?"

08:46.767 --> 08:47.834
TURKEY.

08:47.834 --> 08:48.934
CORRECT.

08:48.934 --> 08:52.300
WOW, SHAWN, I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT ONE.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.467
THAT CAME FROM
FEENY'S PREP COURSE?

08:54.467 --> 08:57.300
WELL, IT WAS ONLY
ONE OF THE TOUGHER ONES.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.600
LET ME SEE THAT BOOK.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.834
UH, SEE, MR. FEENY?

08:59.834 --> 09:02.000
RIGHT--RIGHT HERE,
AFTER, UH--
UH, THE QUESTION,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.500
"WHICH IS SWEETER:
SUGAR OR SALT?"

09:05.500 --> 09:06.667
SUGAR.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.734
WOW, 2 IN A ROW.

09:08.734 --> 09:10.100
WHERE ARE MY GLASSES?

09:10.100 --> 09:11.467
UH, SEE, WHAT WE'RE
DOING, MR. FEENY,

09:11.467 --> 09:13.367
IS WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO SHOW SHAWN

09:13.367 --> 09:15.233
THAT, UH, THROUGH
YOUR REVIEW COURSE,

09:15.233 --> 09:17.600
A--A STUDENT
BUILDS A CERTAIN
LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE

09:17.600 --> 09:20.867
THROUGH A SERIES OF
NOT-QUITE QUESTIONS.

09:20.867 --> 09:22.834
IT'S REALLY
THIS BASIC?

09:22.834 --> 09:25.300
SHAWN, I DON'T WANT
ANYONE MISLEADING YOU.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.400
MY PREP COURSE INVOLVES
A LOT OF HARD WORK.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.500
OH, THEN I DON'T
WANT TO DO IT.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.900
BUT IT'S FUN.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.300
TELL HIM, MR. FEENY.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.400
TELL SHAWN ABOUT
THE CARNIVAL-LIKE
ATMOSPHERE

09:35.400 --> 09:37.900
OF YOUR PREP COURSE
SO THAT SHAWN WILL JOIN US.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.133
NO.

09:40.133 --> 09:41.300
COME ON, MR. FEENY.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.000
I MEAN, IF SHAWN DOESN'T
GET INTO COLLEGE,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.967
HE STARTS
WASHING WINDOWS,
PLAYING LOTTO.

09:44.967 --> 09:47.000
THEN HE LOSES HIS TEETH,
BECOMES A WARD
OF THE STATE,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.467
AND MOVES IN WITH YOU.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.734
WELL...

09:52.734 --> 09:56.467
IF I TELL HIM
ABOUT THE, UH...

09:56.467 --> 09:58.000
CAKE...

10:00.200 --> 10:04.200
WELL, THEN EVERYONE WILL
WANT TO TAKE THE CLASS.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.934
CAKE?

10:05.934 --> 10:07.300
YES, CAKE.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.100
DELICIOUS CAKE,
ACTUALLY,

10:09.100 --> 10:13.033
FROM THE, UH,
WESTCHESTER BAKERY...

10:13.033 --> 10:15.200
IS WHERE
WE GET THE CAKES.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.033
IT'S, UH...

10:18.033 --> 10:20.867
WHERE WE GET THEM.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.700
REALLY? WHAT ELSE?

10:22.700 --> 10:24.400
WHAT, CAKE'S NOT ENOUGH?

10:26.767 --> 10:28.400
FINE, UH...

10:28.400 --> 10:30.600
AND THEN
WE HAVE A, UH...

10:30.600 --> 10:33.000
TALENT SHOW
SOME NIGHTS.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.367
THIS IS AMAZING.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.934
CORY, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ANY OF THIS?

10:36.934 --> 10:38.367
UH, MR. HUNTER,

10:38.367 --> 10:40.000
IN BETWEEN THE HOOPLA,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.233
THERE WILL BE
LEARNING GOING ON.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.200
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
CAKE, RIGHT?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.400
YES, CAKE.

10:48.233 --> 10:50.800
THANKS A LOT, MR. FEENY.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.300
I SUPPOSE.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.834
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
WHAT GOOD IS IT

10:54.834 --> 10:57.600
IF YOU CAN'T GET
THE BUTTS IN THE SEATS?

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
HEY, DAD.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.200
HEY, ERIC.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.300
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, HUH?

11:09.300 --> 11:11.567
ABOUT 12 HOURS.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.700
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
IT SEEMS LONGER WHEN
YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR OWN.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.100
OH, DAD, THIS IS
MY PARTNER RONNY PATELL.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.467
HI, IT'S GOOD
TO MEET YOU.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.133
NICE TO MEET YOU, RONNY.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.600
IT'S A VERY NICE STORE
YOU HAVE HERE.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.100
I ADMIRE ANYONE
WHO RUNS HIS OWN BUSINESS.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.900
ONE DAY, I HOPE
TO DO THE SAME.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.367
YEAH, RONNY'S COOL.
HE'S LETTING ME CRASH
WITH HIM FOR A WHILE.

11:27.367 --> 11:29.000
WE'RE, UH, GOING
TO BE ROOMIES.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.500
ERIC TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR LITTLE FAMILY CRISIS.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.500
I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT THE MOTHER
GOING INSANE

11:33.500 --> 11:35.367
AND THROWING PEOPLE
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.033
YOU KNOW, RONNY,
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK
AROUND A LITTLE BIT?

11:41.400 --> 11:42.834
YOU'RE MAD AT YOUR MOTHER?

11:42.834 --> 11:44.133
YEAH.

11:44.133 --> 11:45.600
BUT YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME?

11:45.600 --> 11:47.400
NO.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.767
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE,

11:48.767 --> 11:51.200
BECAUSE AS MUCH
AS YOU MESSED UP,
I MESSED UP EVEN MORE.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.133
I SHOULD'VE FIRED YOU.
I SHOULD'VE FIRED YOU
A MILLION TIMES.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.200
DAD, DAD, EASE UP.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.500
ERIC, YOU'RE A GOOF-OFF.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.934
WELL, I WON'T BE FRIENDS
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

12:00.934 --> 12:04.000
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN
I STARTED MESSING UP?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.867
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

12:05.867 --> 12:08.400
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WAS
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.567
UH, THE ONLY THING
I REMEMBER

12:09.567 --> 12:11.467
IS THAT CUTE NURSE
WHO SLAPPED ME
ON THE TUSHIE.

12:11.467 --> 12:14.567
I REMEMBER DR. HODGES
GAVE ME THESE RUBBER GLOVES
TO PUT ON

12:14.567 --> 12:16.367
TO KEEP EVERYTHING
SAFE AND CLEAN.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.100
SO I PUT THEM ON,
AND THEN YOU WERE BORN,

12:18.100 --> 12:21.000
AND YOU WERE
MOANING AND GROANING
LIKE YOU DO NOW.

12:22.767 --> 12:23.767
AND I DID WHAT
EVERY FATHER DOES.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.567
I COUNTED FINGERS,
I COUNTED TOES.

12:25.567 --> 12:28.400
I LOOKED AT YOU, AND
YOU WERE HEALTHY AND VITAL.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.400
AND I WAS HAPPY,
AND I KISSED YOUR MOM.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.867
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

12:32.867 --> 12:35.000
BECAUSE IT'S
20 YEARS LATER,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.200
AND I'VE JUST
FIGURED SOMETHING OUT.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.567
I'VE NEVER TAKEN OFF
THOSE GLOVES.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.133
HMM?

12:43.133 --> 12:47.834
I HAVE BEEN TREATING YOU
WITH KID GLOVES
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.000
AND IT'S NOT
YOUR MOM'S FAULT.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.767
IT'S NOT FEENY'S.

12:51.767 --> 12:52.700
IT'S MINE.

12:54.300 --> 12:55.800
ALL YOU DID
WAS LOVE ME.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.967
YEAH, AND I DO.

12:57.967 --> 13:00.934
AND I LOVE CORY,
AND I LOVE MORGAN.

13:00.934 --> 13:04.233
BUT BECAUSE
YOU WERE THE FIRSTBORN,
I LOVED YOU DIFFERENTLY.

13:04.233 --> 13:07.734
I LET YOU GET AWAY
WITH STUFF. I LET YOU
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME,

13:07.734 --> 13:11.000
BUT I DID A LOUSY JOB
OF PREPARING YOU

13:11.000 --> 13:14.934
FOR THE WORLD
THAT IS OUT THERE.

13:14.934 --> 13:17.300
NOW, ONE DAY,
I'M NOT GOING
TO BE AROUND ANYMORE,

13:17.300 --> 13:21.500
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ON YOUR OWN.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.000
THEN WHAT?

13:30.734 --> 13:33.600
I DID NOT KNOW
THE BOSSES REQUIRED US
TO HAVE A GUARD DOG.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.734
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THEY DON'T,
BUT I JUST FIGURE

13:35.734 --> 13:37.667
WITH A BEAT AS
ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE
AS JOHN ADAMS HIGH,

13:37.667 --> 13:40.133
WE COULD USE
A LITTLE BACKUP.

13:40.133 --> 13:42.133
IT DOES NOT APPEAR
TO BE VERY FEROCIOUS.

13:42.133 --> 13:45.100
WHAT? HE'S
A TRAINED KILLER.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.600
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
POPPY SEED?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.467
YOU'RE A TRAINED KILLER,
AREN'T YOU?

13:48.467 --> 13:49.767
YEAH. YES, YOU ARE.

13:49.767 --> 13:51.100
ALL RIGHT.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.767
LISTEN, I KNOW
THIS IS A SENSITIVE
SUBJECT, ERIC,

13:53.767 --> 13:56.867
BUT, UH, YOUR MOTHER,
IS SHE BACK
FROM THE INSANE?

13:56.867 --> 13:59.300
OH, R.P.,
MY MOM'S NOT INSANE.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.600
AND, ACTUALLY, UM,
NEXT TIME WE TALK,

14:00.600 --> 14:02.400
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD KIND OF
KEEP THAT BETWEEN US?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.367
I UNDERSTAND.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.667
SO, ERIC, WHILE WE
WAIT FOR DANGER,

14:06.667 --> 14:08.000
WILL YOU HELP ME
WITH MY STUDIES?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.934
YEAH, SURE,
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

14:09.934 --> 14:11.400
I'M TRYING TO GET
INTO COLLEGE,

14:11.400 --> 14:14.500
AND THIS IS THE BOOK
THAT HELPS YOU PREPARE
FOR THE ENTRANCE EXAM.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.934
WAIT A SECOND. I THOUGHT
YOU SAID THAT BACK HOME

14:15.934 --> 14:17.734
YOU WERE, LIKE,
AN ENGINEER OR SOMETHING.

14:17.734 --> 14:19.834
BACK HOME,
I<i>AM </i>AN ENGINEER,

14:19.834 --> 14:21.400
BUT, HERE,
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.767
I MUST START OVER,
AND I'M WILLING TO.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.767
WAIT A SECOND.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.567
YOU'VE ALREADY GONE
TO COLLEGE,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.300
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO GO AGAIN?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.100
I KNOW IT'S
A LOT OF HARD WORK,

14:31.100 --> 14:34.300
BUT ANYTHING OF VALUE
IS WORTH THAT HARD WORK.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.200
AND IN THIS COUNTRY,
THERE ARE SO MANY
OPPORTUNITIES.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.800
LOOK AT YOU,
FULFILLING YOUR DREAM
OF DOING THIS JOB--

14:40.800 --> 14:42.467
SECURITY GUY.

14:42.467 --> 14:44.967
WAIT A SECOND. YOU THINK
THIS IS MY DREAM?

14:44.967 --> 14:47.367
WELL, IT MUST BE.
YOU ARE DOING IT.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.400
YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,
LOOK AT YOU.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.600
YOU'RE DOING IT, TOO.
YOU---YOU'RE
A SECURITY GUY.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.867
OH, NO, NO, NO.

14:53.867 --> 14:55.600
I AM AN ENGINEER,

14:55.600 --> 14:58.400
AND SOON,
THEY WILL KNOW IT.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.600
[RUMBLING]
OK, WHAT WAS THAT?

15:00.600 --> 15:03.200
UP, POPPY SEED.
UP, POPPY SEED.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.567
OK, BETTER,
YOU PRETEND TO BE ASLEEP

15:04.567 --> 15:06.367
AND THEN SPRING
INTO ACTION TO SAVE ME
AT THE LAST SECOND.

15:06.367 --> 15:09.100
COME ON, R.P. THIS IS WHERE
YOUR EXPERIENCE IS NEEDED.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.233
COME ON.

15:10.233 --> 15:13.300
I GOT YOUR BACK.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.200
OK.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.100
OH, HI, MR. FEENY, OK.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.100
YOU SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.000
I SCARED YOU?
YOU SNUCK UP ON ME.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
OH.
YOU KNOW HIM?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.133
UH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
HE'S FINE.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.500
THEN I'LL GO BACK
TO MY STUDIES.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.967
ALL RIGHT, MR. FEENY,
I STILL GOT TO DO THIS
BY THE BOOK,

15:31.967 --> 15:35.600
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT JOHN ADAMS HIGH
AFTER SCHOOL HOURS?

15:37.100 --> 15:40.033
S.A.T. PREP COURSE,
MR. MATTHEWS.

15:40.033 --> 15:41.767
AND JUDGING
FROM THE HOTBED

15:41.767 --> 15:44.734
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
RAGING OUT HERE,

15:44.734 --> 15:47.967
I THINK YOUR TIME
WOULD BE BETTER SPENT
INSIDE WITH US.

15:47.967 --> 15:50.233
TAKE THE CLASS?
WELL--

15:50.233 --> 15:52.567
NO, I DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO DO THAT.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.500
WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF, ERIC?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.667
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.033
NO...

15:58.033 --> 16:00.300
YOU'RE
AFRAID OF SOMETHING,
AND IT'S STOPPING YOU.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.800
STOPPING ME?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.467
FROM WHAT?

16:03.467 --> 16:07.233
FROM BECOMING
WHAT WE ALL KNOW
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF BEING.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.200
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF,
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.000
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
MR. FEENY, I'M ALWAYS
HEARING THAT--

16:11.000 --> 16:12.200
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.500
I TOOK THE S.A.T.s
LAST YEAR, REMEMBER?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.200
I BLEW THEM.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.467
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I'M JUST NOT MEANT
TO BE IN COLLEGE.

16:18.467 --> 16:21.467
MAYBE YOU'RE SOMEONE
WHO GIVES UP TOO EASILY.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.767
WHAT'LL IT BE,
MR. MATTHEWS?

16:24.767 --> 16:26.133
WHO ARE YOU?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.100
WHAT IN
HEAVEN'S NAME?

17:20.100 --> 17:22.700
MR. FEENY, WE'VE
GOT A FEW ISSUES
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.200
YEAH!

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
WE JUST CAME FROM
TAKING OUR S.A.T.s.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.000
YEAH.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.033
HOW DID YOU DO?

17:28.033 --> 17:29.133
YEAH!

17:30.867 --> 17:32.100
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE, SIR.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.300
FOR MORE YEARS
THAN I CARE TO REMEMBER,

17:34.300 --> 17:36.467
YOU HAVE DROVE US NUTS
BY FILLING OUR HEADS

17:36.467 --> 17:39.200
WITH DATES AND IDEAS
AND NUMBERS
AND CONCEPTS.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.400
YEAH, AND WITH
THE LAST 3 WEEKS
OF THAT COURSE OF YOURS,

17:41.400 --> 17:43.000
DRILLING US,
PUSHING US TO THE EDGE.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.700
YEAH, AND MAKING ME
EAT CAKE.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.967
5 POUNDS RIGHT HERE,
BABY.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.400
AND NOW THAT
IT'S ALL OVER

17:48.400 --> 17:49.667
AND WE'VE TAKEN THE TEST,

17:49.667 --> 17:51.767
WE HAD TO COME HERE
AND TELL YOU TO YOUR FACE.

17:51.767 --> 17:53.600
THANKS A LOT, MAN.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.867
WE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD
WHY YOU PUSHED US
SO HARD.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.600
WE'RE REALLY GLAD
YOU DID.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.400
HI, MOM.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.200
HI, ERIC.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.300
YOU FIRED ME.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.500
I DID.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.900
WELL, UM...

18:23.900 --> 18:25.100
I GUESS I DESERVED
TO BE FIRED

18:25.100 --> 18:26.900
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE ME,

18:26.900 --> 18:29.767
AND I KNOW IT MUST'VE
BEEN REALLY HARD FOR YOU
TO FIRE YOUR SON.

18:29.767 --> 18:32.600
I'M JUST SORRY
I LET YOU DOWN.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.834
THANK YOU, ERIC.

18:34.834 --> 18:36.567
AND YOU...

18:36.567 --> 18:38.033
YOU SAID SOMETHING
WRONG TO ME.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.834
I WAS THE GOOD GUY
IN ALL OF THIS,

18:40.834 --> 18:42.567
AND YOU TURNED IT
AROUND, DIDN'T YOU?

18:42.567 --> 18:45.200
GOOD FOR YOU.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.567
SEE,

18:46.567 --> 18:48.367
YOU SAID TO ME THAT
THERE WOULD COME A TIME

18:48.367 --> 18:50.133
WHERE YOU WEREN'T GONNA
BE AROUND ANYMORE,

18:50.133 --> 18:51.734
AND THAT'S NOT SO.
ERIC.

18:51.734 --> 18:54.600
NO, DAD, I REMEMBER
EVERYTHING

18:54.600 --> 18:55.667
THAT YOU TAUGHT ME.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.500
AND I'M GONNA
TURN AROUND,

18:57.500 --> 19:00.600
AND I'M
GONNA TEACH THAT
TO MY CHILDREN.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.834
SO, YOU SEE, DAD,
YOU'RE ALWAYS
GONNA BE AROUND.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.000
WELL, THANK YOU, ERIC.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.500
AND I REMEMBER
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU TAUGHT ME

19:11.500 --> 19:14.367
WAS THAT I COULD BE
ANYTHING THAT
I WANTED TO BE.

19:14.367 --> 19:15.467
YES, I DID.

19:15.467 --> 19:17.467
DO YOU STILL
BELIEVE THAT?

19:17.467 --> 19:19.033
YES, I DO.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.467
IF YOU DON'T TAKE
THE EASY WAY OUT

19:21.467 --> 19:23.100
AND TRY AS HARD
AS YOU CAN.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.567
WELL, I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:25.567 --> 19:28.000
BECAUSE I TRIED
AS HARD AS I COULD.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.000
S.A.T. SCORES?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.200
YOU TOOK THE TEST?

19:34.200 --> 19:36.400
I DID, AND I THOUGHT
THAT WE SHOULD ALL, UM,

19:36.400 --> 19:38.033
YOU KNOW,
OPEN IT TOGETHER.

19:38.033 --> 19:39.867
OK.

19:39.867 --> 19:42.000
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.300
I DIDN'T TAKE
THE EASY WAY OUT.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.667
I TRIED AS HARD
AS I COULD.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.100
YOU TRIED AS HARD
AS YOU COULD?

19:49.100 --> 19:51.133
YEAH, I DID.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.100
WELL, THEN,
IT'S A GOOD THING

19:53.100 --> 19:54.734
YOU'RE NOT WORKING
FOR YOUR FATHER ANYMORE,

19:54.734 --> 19:56.967
OR I'D HAVE TO FIRE YOU.

19:56.967 --> 19:58.367
WHAT?

19:58.367 --> 20:02.033
1120. THAT'S
200 POINTS HIGHER
THAN LAST TIME, ERIC.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.200
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.200
I'M VERY,
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.367
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.767
I KNEW I COULD
DO IT, TOO.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.300
YES!

20:33.600 --> 20:35.200
MR. FEENY.

20:36.133 --> 20:38.667
MR. FEENY.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.300
MR. FEENY!

20:44.100 --> 20:47.000
HI. IT'S ME, ERIC.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

20:49.100 --> 20:50.667
WELL, I WAS SLEEPING.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.734
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE
GOTTEN ACCUSTOMED TO

20:52.734 --> 20:54.300
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.500
THAT'S COOL.
UM, GET DRESSED.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.233
ARE YOU CRAZY, MAN?

20:59.233 --> 21:01.400
YEAH. YEAH, I AM.
I GOT THIS BOOK OF COLLEGES,

21:01.400 --> 21:03.200
AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
PICK OUT A GOOD ONE, OK?

21:03.200 --> 21:04.767
COME ON, GET DRESSED.
LET'S GO.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.400
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING,

21:06.400 --> 21:08.600
WE'LL GO A-COLLEGE
PICKIN'.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
NO, NO, NO. I REALLY
NEED YOUR HELP NOW.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
THOSE SPACES, THEY'RE
FILLING UP FAST.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.233
HOW ABOUT PENBROOK?

21:14.233 --> 21:17.100
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT'S A VERY
GOOD SCHOOL.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.100
HOW ABOUT HARVARD,
ANY GOOD?

21:21.133 --> 21:22.734
ALL RIGHT,
PUT ON THE COFFEE.

21:22.734 --> 21:24.567
I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE KITCHEN.

21:24.567 --> 21:25.967
ALL RIGHT.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.400
HEY, MR. FEENY.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.367
WHAT?

21:29.367 --> 21:32.100
I HEARD YOU TOLD MY PARENTS
YOU THOUGHT I WAS SMART.

21:34.967 --> 21:35.867
JUST KNOWING YOU SAID THAT

21:35.867 --> 21:38.233
WAS WORTH ABOUT
1,000 S.A.T. POINTS.
