WEBVTT

02:15.343 --> 02:17.376
Give it up, Frank!

02:37.365 --> 02:38.562
- Joe Cribbens.

02:40.225 --> 02:43.600
- Joe Cribbens! Visitor!

02:47.606 --> 02:50.970
- Well, goddamn. Hard to figure
who I'd less rather see.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.611
What brings a skunk
like you here?

02:54.646 --> 02:57.878
- I was in the neighborhood
collecting reward money.

02:57.913 --> 02:59.583
Thought I'd pay you a visit.

02:59.618 --> 03:03.356
- Yeah. Heard you took down
Frank Ledbetter last week.

03:03.391 --> 03:07.327
We get all the news in here.
You'd be surprised.

03:08.759 --> 03:11.089
How much you gonna collect
for old Frank?

03:11.124 --> 03:14.301
Friend of yours?
- Never met the man,

03:14.336 --> 03:16.094
but I was on his side.

03:18.406 --> 03:22.100
Okay, bounty man. Did you give
him much of a chance?

03:22.135 --> 03:23.970
- Same chance he gave me.

03:26.942 --> 03:28.909
- Give it up, Frank!

03:31.914 --> 03:35.916
- Right. Just another fella
dead for a dollar.

03:35.951 --> 03:40.019
I figure you know I'm getting
out of here next week.

03:40.791 --> 03:44.496
Served my time. All five years.

03:44.531 --> 03:46.300
- I heard you've been
telling people

03:46.335 --> 03:48.302
first thing you were gonna do
when you walk out of here

03:48.337 --> 03:50.766
is get a gun and look me up.

03:50.801 --> 03:52.570
- Don't flatter yourself.

03:52.605 --> 03:54.803
I'm not going out of my way
to find you.

03:55.872 --> 03:58.444
I'm going to head down
to Mexico.

03:58.479 --> 04:01.810
Just... play out the string.

04:01.845 --> 04:04.945
Cards, tequila, señoritas...

04:04.980 --> 04:07.079
- No matter where you're headed,

04:07.114 --> 04:10.885
you'll still end up the same.
Horse thief.

04:12.317 --> 04:14.625
- Guilty.
- Bank robber.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.958
- Couldn't prove it.
- Killed a couple of men.

04:18.499 --> 04:20.961
- Couldn't prove it,
and I never killed nobody

04:20.996 --> 04:23.337
that wasn't trying to kill me.

04:31.842 --> 04:34.876
When you took me down,
I was sleeping.

04:36.242 --> 04:37.780
It wasn't a real fight.

04:37.815 --> 04:41.388
I just... woke up with a gun
in my face.

04:41.423 --> 04:43.214
- Stay clear of me, Joe.

04:44.349 --> 04:45.854
- You do the same!

04:46.890 --> 04:50.595
Otherwise, most likely,
you're a dead man.

04:52.225 --> 04:56.436
- I don't usually tell a man
twice. Stay clear of me, Joe.

05:03.104 --> 05:04.576
- Shit heel.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.801
- Prisoner number 387,
Joe Cribbens.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.905
Your paperwork came
in the afternoon mail.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.907
Tomorrow morning 10 o'clock,

05:38.942 --> 05:41.008
you get your possessions back
and a government check

05:41.043 --> 05:44.110
for 50 dollars.
Good luck to you, Joe.

05:44.145 --> 05:45.452
- Yes, sir.

05:46.884 --> 05:48.081
Yip!

06:12.107 --> 06:13.777
Take a last look.

06:36.769 --> 06:39.638
Captain Brand.
Rider approaching, sir.

06:48.308 --> 06:51.012
Good morning.
Let me take care of your horse.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.790
Max Borlund, follow us.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.131
Sir. Mr. Borlund, sir.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.803
- As you were, corporal.

07:15.808 --> 07:19.678
Mr. Borlund. It's good
to see you again.

07:19.713 --> 07:22.043
It's been some time.
- It has.

07:22.078 --> 07:25.519
- This is Martin Kidd. He could
stand to use your services.

07:25.554 --> 07:27.884
Mr. Kidd is a prominent
businessman here

07:27.919 --> 07:30.381
in the territory,
and a friend to the army.

07:31.890 --> 07:35.155
- Mr. Borlund, it seems your
reputation precedes you.

07:35.190 --> 07:36.893
- I'll accept that
as a compliment.

07:36.928 --> 07:39.060
- Gentlemen, this is
a clandestine moment

07:39.095 --> 07:41.568
and a meeting
that never happened.

07:41.603 --> 07:44.461
That's why I've convened it out
here in the middle of nowhere.

07:44.496 --> 07:46.903
I'll let you two
get down to business.

07:46.938 --> 07:50.874
- Um, Mr. Borlund, I doubt
that you're familiar

07:50.909 --> 07:53.173
with a Buffalo soldier
by the name of Elijah Jones?

07:53.208 --> 07:54.977
Private Elijah Jones? No?

07:55.012 --> 07:58.376
<i>Right, he's taken a white woman,</i>
<i>my wife, Rachel.</i>

07:58.411 --> 08:00.818
<i>Abducted her three weeks ago,</i>

08:00.853 --> 08:03.249
<i>took her across the border</i>
<i>down to Mexico.</i>

08:03.284 --> 08:06.483
<i>- I sent out patrols,</i>
<i>thought we could head 'em off,</i>

08:06.518 --> 08:09.596
find 'em before they got
to the border. We missed 'em.

08:09.631 --> 08:12.159
- Alright, so, son of a bitch
is asking for $10,000

08:12.194 --> 08:13.996
in ransom money,
which I will not pay.

08:14.031 --> 08:17.604
I do not reward criminals,
but I am willing to offer you

08:17.639 --> 08:22.070
$2,000 to bring Rachel back.
$500 advance.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.617
This will help you
identify Rachel.

08:30.652 --> 08:33.587
Captain Brand there
has a document stating

08:33.622 --> 08:36.249
that you are a representative
of the United States government

08:36.284 --> 08:38.625
and you're in pursuit of Elijah,
in case you run into any

08:38.660 --> 08:41.254
legal problems down in Mexico.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.564
- Well, three weeks head
start...

08:44.490 --> 08:48.063
I need supplies, a pack mule,
ammunition.

08:48.098 --> 08:51.561
- Discretion in this matter,
that's of paramount importance.

08:51.596 --> 08:54.498
It's my wife's reputation
to consider.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.468
As well as my own.

08:57.503 --> 08:58.678
- Sergeant Poe!

08:59.947 --> 09:02.473
- Off the books, we're sending
one soldier to accompany you.

09:04.609 --> 09:08.314
- Sir! Mr. Borlund,
as ordered by the captain,

09:08.349 --> 09:10.756
Sergeant Alonzo Poe
reporting for duty, sir!

09:12.452 --> 09:14.628
Make sure
he dresses civilian.

09:14.663 --> 09:16.663
Things need to look proper.

09:16.698 --> 09:18.390
Don't want you two
to travel together

09:18.425 --> 09:19.930
until you're both south
of the border.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.526
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Sir, yes, sir!

09:38.379 --> 09:41.853
Well, well. Here comes
the bounty man.

09:43.318 --> 09:45.087
Captain say he the best shooter
in the territory,

09:45.122 --> 09:46.627
rifle or pistol.

09:59.301 --> 10:00.498
- Sergeant Poe.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.566
- Mr. Borlund, sir.

10:03.877 --> 10:06.141
- The captain tells me
you're gonna be a very

10:06.176 --> 10:07.945
valuable man on this trip.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.013
- I just want to say
if things get tight,

10:10.048 --> 10:12.642
I'm a damn good shot.
Best eye in the regiment.

10:12.677 --> 10:15.117
- Captain also says

10:15.152 --> 10:18.791
you have an idea where Mrs. Kidd
and this Elijah Jones may be.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.893
- Oh, I know exactly where.
Got the map right here.

10:23.094 --> 10:24.324
Can't do much better than that,

10:24.359 --> 10:25.556
now can you?

10:25.591 --> 10:27.195
Shows you right to where
they're hiding out.

10:27.230 --> 10:28.526
Now, this here map
was given to me

10:28.561 --> 10:29.967
by Private Elijah Jones himself.

10:30.002 --> 10:31.661
- Private Jones
just hands out maps

10:31.696 --> 10:33.872
of where he's gonna be
after he deserts the army

10:33.907 --> 10:36.534
and abducts a white woman?
Let me see this map.

10:46.513 --> 10:49.921
According to this,
they're deep into Chihuahua.

10:49.956 --> 10:52.055
- Mm-hmm.
That sounds about right.

10:52.090 --> 10:54.024
Elijah said it was a fair piece.

10:54.895 --> 10:58.358
- Look, normally we'd head
straight to San Juanito.

10:58.393 --> 11:00.096
It's the best road south.

11:00.901 --> 11:03.836
Start asking if anyone's seen
a Black man travelling

11:03.871 --> 11:06.201
with a white woman,
but if he abducted her,

11:06.236 --> 11:08.335
he'd avoid showing up in cities.

11:08.370 --> 11:12.537
- No. He run off,
damn foolish. But...

11:13.947 --> 11:16.046
Well, Elijah didn't
abduct nobody.

11:17.478 --> 11:19.049
- That's not what
I've been told.

11:20.415 --> 11:21.953
- Let me tell you about Elijah.

11:22.615 --> 11:26.188
Like all of God's children,
he's got his faults.

11:26.223 --> 11:28.223
But in a lot of ways,
he's a really good fella.

11:30.293 --> 11:33.800
I know these is delicate
matters, but I gotta say,

11:33.835 --> 11:36.462
if she's with Elijah,
it's 'cause she wanna be.

11:37.069 --> 11:38.838
- Sounds like
you're defending him.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.369
- Private Elijah Jones
was expecting me

11:42.404 --> 11:45.174
to join up with him. Gave me
the map so I could find the way.

11:45.847 --> 11:49.079
Now I'm the one who's supposed
to deliver the ransom money.

11:49.114 --> 11:52.214
That's why I truly do believe
they are holed up

11:52.249 --> 11:55.085
in the middle of nowhere
at an American fella's place,

11:55.120 --> 11:56.614
named Hannon.

11:56.649 --> 12:00.123
- There's a Hannon
that's a wanted man in Texas.

12:00.158 --> 12:02.257
The poster's been up
for five years.

12:02.292 --> 12:05.590
Accomplice to murder.
Bank robbery in El Paso.

12:06.868 --> 12:08.329
Do you know this woman?
Mm-hmm.

12:08.364 --> 12:09.759
Ain't never met her.

12:09.794 --> 12:12.300
She helped improve Elijah's
reading in the school.

12:12.335 --> 12:13.873
At least that's what he told me.

12:14.843 --> 12:18.207
- Yeah, is this the face that
launched a thousand ships?

12:19.441 --> 12:21.342
- You wanna run that by me
one more time?

12:21.883 --> 12:24.345
- Ah, it's a line by Marlowe,
Shakespeare's time,

12:24.380 --> 12:26.248
you know, about Helen of Troy.

12:26.283 --> 12:28.283
- All right, right, right, I was
just reading all about that

12:28.318 --> 12:29.350
just the other day.

12:30.122 --> 12:32.485
- You trust that map?
- Mm-hmm.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.927
And they're holed up down there

12:34.962 --> 12:36.489
waiting for the money
that I ain't bringing.

12:38.625 --> 12:43.001
Ooh! Yes, sir! I guess you wanna
know my story too, huh?

12:43.036 --> 12:45.300
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, come on, now, Mr. Borlund.

12:45.335 --> 12:47.104
A little friendly talk
to help the time pass by.

12:47.139 --> 12:48.303
Ain't that true?

12:48.338 --> 12:50.041
- Thanks.
- You want me to call you Max?

12:54.509 --> 12:56.674
- I think Mr. Borlund
will do just fine.

12:57.512 --> 12:59.215
- Mr. Borlund it is.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.481
See now, the thing with Elijah
here is real simple.

13:02.055 --> 13:03.351
He wasn't an army man.

13:04.057 --> 13:06.519
See, where I come from,
a new bed,

13:06.554 --> 13:09.863
clean clothes, a good horse,
and three square meals a day

13:09.898 --> 13:11.524
sounded like
a mighty fine deal.

13:11.559 --> 13:13.724
I joined up in the army
when I was 17.

13:14.694 --> 13:17.629
The captain, he filled me in
about you too now, sir.

13:17.664 --> 13:21.303
Captain say you either a
Dutchman, or a Swede, or a...

13:21.338 --> 13:22.832
a German or something such.

13:22.867 --> 13:25.175
Captain say you used to be
a soldier some time way back.

13:25.210 --> 13:26.803
Ain't too sure about
which army, though.

13:26.838 --> 13:28.838
- Mm-hmm.
- Mind telling me?

13:28.873 --> 13:32.380
Is you a Dutchman or a Swede?
Whatever?

13:32.415 --> 13:34.888
- Not at all. I'm an American.

13:54.371 --> 13:55.700
- You know, uh...

13:57.209 --> 13:59.374
You've been acting real jumpy
the last few days.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.709
- I've come to realize...

14:06.647 --> 14:09.285
...my whole life, I've done
impulsive things.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.059
They don't always work out.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.228
Got a reserve of 20 bullets.

14:19.099 --> 14:21.165
I'm gonna use another five
to practice.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.729
I keep being told this is
a dangerous country.

14:36.941 --> 14:40.019
I'll never give them the
pleasure of watching me cry.

14:40.318 --> 14:43.781
- Good. Yeah, I like that.

14:44.685 --> 14:46.421
We did what we done.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.995
And we just saying
to all of them,

14:49.030 --> 14:50.590
"Piss upon ya.

14:51.692 --> 14:53.263
Go straight to hell."

15:08.181 --> 15:11.809
- I was sent here by Tiberio
because my English is good.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.646
Very good, as you can tell.

15:14.319 --> 15:18.519
Let me begin saying I am honored
to meet you, Mrs. Kidd.

15:18.554 --> 15:21.621
Obviously, a very kind and
beautiful woman.

15:22.624 --> 15:25.361
- I say thank you, Mr. Romero.

15:25.396 --> 15:27.330
But maybe you should get
to the point.

15:28.036 --> 15:29.365
Why are you here?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.533
- Oh. I'm here to represent
Tiberio Vargas,

15:32.568 --> 15:35.602
and to give response
to the financial offer

15:35.637 --> 15:37.604
made to him by Señor Hannon.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.177
Let us review the facts.

15:39.212 --> 15:41.476
- We don't have to do
this business here and now,

15:41.511 --> 15:42.873
in front of these people.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.876
- Mr. Hannon owes Tiberio Vargas

15:45.911 --> 15:47.779
several thousand dollars
in gambling debt.

15:47.814 --> 15:52.223
- Hold on, goddamn it!
This is between me and Tiberio.

15:52.258 --> 15:56.359
- To retire the debt, Mr. Hannon
has offered Tiberio Vargas

15:56.394 --> 15:59.956
$5,000 of Mrs. Kidd's
ransom money,

15:59.991 --> 16:03.201
in return for your safe passage
to Veracruz and then Cuba.

16:03.731 --> 16:07.568
- Goddamn it. You son
of a bitch, you sold us out.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.043
- All right...

16:10.936 --> 16:12.540
I needed money.

16:12.575 --> 16:16.808
The two of you, you eat up
my food, sleep all hours.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.579
You don't pay shit for rent.

16:19.285 --> 16:23.980
And worst of all, I gotta deal
with this hell cat of yours

16:24.015 --> 16:26.917
complaining all the time
about how dirty it is

16:26.952 --> 16:31.361
for her dainty self and that I
live like a goddamn bindlestiff!

16:31.396 --> 16:33.858
I don't see why I gotta
put up with this shit

16:33.893 --> 16:35.926
from this rich bitch whore

16:35.961 --> 16:37.763
without getting paid
royal for it!

16:45.608 --> 16:49.038
I've decided...
the price for room and board

16:49.073 --> 16:52.580
for these two runaways
is $2,500.

16:53.385 --> 16:56.584
Everybody in this deal
is guaranteed something.

16:57.081 --> 16:58.586
Everybody benefits.

16:59.457 --> 17:01.754
- I'll tell you
about guarantees.

17:01.789 --> 17:03.294
I'll guarantee you this.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.759
I am not a whore.

17:28.079 --> 17:32.290
- A message is sent
to Tiberio by Señor Hannon.

17:32.754 --> 17:36.052
His offer proposes that Tiberio,
for $5,000,

17:36.087 --> 17:40.694
will guarantee safe conduct for
you and Mrs. Kidd to Veracruz.

17:41.796 --> 17:43.796
I have come here to
tell you that

17:43.831 --> 17:46.634
Tiberio accepts your proposal.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.936
- Maybe this actually works.

17:52.642 --> 17:56.314
Sure, we lose some money, but...
it gets us a clean getaway.

18:26.214 --> 18:27.510
- Mr. Borlund.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.192
Outlaws?
- Until proven differently.

18:59.676 --> 19:00.708
- Greetings.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.876
This is Señor Tiberio Vargas,

19:03.911 --> 19:06.516
I am Esteban Romero,
at your service.

19:06.551 --> 19:08.320
I will translate.

19:08.355 --> 19:12.225
Señor Vargas is a very important
and generous man.

19:12.260 --> 19:15.426
Ten years ago, he sent me
to Monterrey to study law.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.002
As you can see,
Tiberio is hunting,

19:31.037 --> 19:32.938
entertaining his guest and
business associate,

19:32.973 --> 19:34.577
Señor Palmer.

19:34.612 --> 19:37.712
Señor Palmer has come
all the way from London

19:37.747 --> 19:39.714
to do business with Tiberio.

19:39.749 --> 19:42.079
- Really?
- Uh, Tiberio says

19:42.114 --> 19:43.916
that the land
you're travelling through,

19:43.951 --> 19:46.919
the water you're helping
yourselves to is all his,

19:46.954 --> 19:51.594
and as a result, there is a fee
to be paid for safe passage.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.863
Tiberio is not happy.

19:56.898 --> 19:59.965
He says force
could possibly be used.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.439
He has many guns.

20:01.903 --> 20:04.970
- So do we. Tiberio will be
the first one to be shot.

20:05.005 --> 20:07.973
- If you allow me, sir,
I don't mean to interfere,

20:08.008 --> 20:11.075
but it might not be wise
to contest this issue.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.320
Now, if you want my opinion--
- I don't.

20:16.654 --> 20:19.490
Mr. Poe!
- That'll be me, sir.

20:19.525 --> 20:21.426
Armed and ready.

20:24.794 --> 20:27.729
Down here,
the gringos are not the boss.

20:27.764 --> 20:30.699
- So you do speak English.
- Only when I want.

20:42.383 --> 20:43.679
- Who the hell are you?

20:44.682 --> 20:47.111
- I'm the fella with the gun.
Who the hell is you?

20:47.146 --> 20:49.080
- I go by Jack Tyree.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.214
- Looks like you a long way
from home, Jack.

20:52.217 --> 20:54.217
- I'm giving you advice, amigo.

20:55.187 --> 20:59.332
Clear on out of here. Tiberio
don't kill you, I just might.

20:59.367 --> 21:02.368
I don't much like me some damned
smart mouthed fucker.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.343
- So, what's it gonna be?

21:11.203 --> 21:12.477
How do you want to play it?

21:29.155 --> 21:31.826
Tiberio asks if
you, like so many others,

21:31.861 --> 21:33.663
are here to seek gold.

21:33.698 --> 21:35.533
- We all work for money.

21:43.543 --> 21:46.907
Well, sir,
my name is William Palmer.

21:47.338 --> 21:49.415
I just wish to say that
your good fortune matches

21:49.450 --> 21:51.043
your obstinate stupidity.

21:51.584 --> 21:53.551
<i>- Vamos, vamos!</i>
- Good day.

21:54.422 --> 21:55.586
Yah!

21:58.426 --> 22:01.394
- You find gold,
you must share it with Tiberio.

22:02.023 --> 22:04.760
Otherwise, I guarantee
the consequences will be

22:04.795 --> 22:06.630
extremely unpleasant.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.417
- I don't think we made
a new friend.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.654
Do you wish
for a meal or a room?

23:03.689 --> 23:05.117
- I reckon I need both.

23:05.152 --> 23:07.383
- Ah. How long are you
gonna stay, Señor?

23:07.418 --> 23:10.595
- Ah, a couple of weeks.
Maybe more,<i> quién sabe.</i>

23:10.630 --> 23:12.762
- Ah, we've got lots of rooms.

23:15.866 --> 23:17.503
I give you
the best one.

23:18.198 --> 23:20.396
- Looks to be kind of quiet
around here.

23:20.431 --> 23:21.936
- You know, we have this town.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.971
People still come here
to gamble.

23:24.512 --> 23:26.677
Tiberio Vargas
y<i> sus hombres,</i>

23:26.712 --> 23:28.580
they come here, they gamble.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.407
We still have<i> rucas.</i>
<i>Buenas rucas.</i>

23:31.442 --> 23:34.487
We have the house dealer,
Sylvio, an honest man.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.985
- Right now, that's just
what the doctor ordered.

23:38.020 --> 23:40.460
Gonna suit me right down
to the ground.

23:41.155 --> 23:43.595
Joe Cribbens,
at your service.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.356
-<i> Entonces...</i> What,
you are a businessman?

23:46.391 --> 23:51.031
- I retired. I just like
to play cards and...

23:51.066 --> 23:52.670
stay out of trouble.

24:08.149 --> 24:11.821
- See them two horses down
there? Them is army horses.

24:12.516 --> 24:13.757
The map worked out.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.287
We got 'em, Mr. Borlund.

24:16.322 --> 24:18.223
We got 'em with the element
of surprise.

24:19.864 --> 24:24.229
- The map was correct.
Very good, Mr. Poe. Very good.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.572
- I aim to please.

24:58.639 --> 25:01.772
- Don't seem
to be any luck. Shit.

25:03.270 --> 25:05.369
- You got a bad temper, Jack.

25:06.273 --> 25:09.208
The other night,
you were way out of hand.

25:11.751 --> 25:13.443
You oughta get it under control.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.281
I still can't accept--

25:22.091 --> 25:25.290
- Elijah, don't!
I wouldn't try anything foolish.

25:25.325 --> 25:26.797
Walk away from that gun.

25:26.832 --> 25:29.228
No, no, no, no!
This ain't part of the deal!

25:29.263 --> 25:30.636
This is my private fucking--

25:30.671 --> 25:33.397
- Oh, Mr. Hannon, keep
your arms up and stay quiet!

25:33.432 --> 25:34.904
- Who are you?
- Go easy now, ma'am,

25:34.939 --> 25:37.203
a lot of guns in here.
- Damn you, I asked who are you.

25:37.238 --> 25:38.567
Just what do you think
you're doing?

25:38.602 --> 25:40.206
- We're here on full legal
authority, Mrs. Kidd.

25:40.241 --> 25:42.109
- That, and me and Elijah here
are old friends.

25:42.144 --> 25:44.947
- Alonzo, you done gone over,
you done sold me out?

25:44.982 --> 25:47.818
- Yep! Turns out I'm just a good
old army man, ain't that right?

25:47.853 --> 25:49.886
- You're the only damn person
in the regiment I trusted!

25:49.921 --> 25:52.086
You let me down, brother!
- You let yourself down

25:52.121 --> 25:54.220
with this dumbass plan.
That and getting caught up

25:54.255 --> 25:55.793
with this silly-ass white woman.

25:56.290 --> 25:58.631
- One thing is for certain,
I ain't going back to Texas

25:58.666 --> 26:00.490
with some bounty man!

26:01.768 --> 26:03.163
I got a rope waiting for me.

26:03.198 --> 26:05.495
Get the hell gone
or I'll kill her, sure as hell!

26:05.530 --> 26:07.299
- He's not after you,
he's after us.

26:07.334 --> 26:08.564
- Bullshit!
- Goddamn--

26:23.647 --> 26:24.723
- You killed him.

26:25.154 --> 26:26.285
- Yes, I did.

26:27.321 --> 26:29.453
You're gonna bury him,
Mr. Jones.

26:31.699 --> 26:33.897
Max Borlund. Ma'am.

26:35.329 --> 26:38.033
I've been hired by your husband
to take you home.

27:04.259 --> 27:06.193
- You see the mess
you done got yourself in?

27:06.734 --> 27:09.031
You ain't nothing
but a damn stupid fool.

27:18.944 --> 27:21.208
- I'm not grateful
for your mission here.

27:22.112 --> 27:25.179
But I should thank you
for possibly saving my life.

27:26.116 --> 27:27.984
- Hannon was a foolish man.

27:28.019 --> 27:30.349
- Mr. Hannon was
a treacherous man.

27:32.122 --> 27:33.891
- Get yourself together,
Mrs. Kidd,

27:33.926 --> 27:36.454
and whatever you need,
we ride within the hour.

27:38.458 --> 27:41.096
- I suppose I need
to surrender my gun.

27:41.131 --> 27:43.593
I keep a derringer in my valise.

27:49.810 --> 27:51.876
I'm doing this because
Elijah might

27:51.911 --> 27:53.944
try to do something foolish.

27:54.705 --> 27:56.276
I wouldn't want
to see him killed.

27:57.642 --> 27:59.675
I'd feel more than
partially responsible

27:59.710 --> 28:01.248
if he came to any harm.

28:01.789 --> 28:05.417
- Deserted the army,
attempted extortion.

28:05.452 --> 28:07.221
He's coming in
for a lot of harm.

28:07.718 --> 28:10.719
- Maybe the easiest way out
of this mess is to shoot you.

28:10.754 --> 28:13.095
And solve at least
some of my problems.

28:13.801 --> 28:16.296
- I don't think that's such
a good idea, Mrs. Kidd.

28:27.276 --> 28:30.508
- Mr. Borlund,
I have a question.

28:32.776 --> 28:36.085
Are you under the impression
that you are rescuing me?

28:36.582 --> 28:38.153
- I was told
that you were abducted.

28:38.782 --> 28:40.254
- That was a lie.

28:40.289 --> 28:43.257
- I've also been told that
by Sergeant Poe.

29:30.801 --> 29:33.373
- When you killed Mr. Hannon
back at his cabin...

29:33.408 --> 29:34.308
- Mm-hmm.

29:35.509 --> 29:38.279
- Your bullets missed
my head by inches.

29:38.314 --> 29:39.379
- Mm-hmm.

29:41.350 --> 29:43.482
- You're that confident
in your marksmanship?

29:44.188 --> 29:45.154
- No.

29:49.930 --> 29:51.259
- Thought you was my friend.

29:52.856 --> 29:54.757
You went and turned
your back on me.

30:00.039 --> 30:01.566
- Now, you listen
to me, brother.

30:02.404 --> 30:03.766
This thing ain't over yet.

30:04.868 --> 30:06.802
I might just be able
to get you out of this mess

30:06.837 --> 30:08.177
you done put yourself in.

30:09.444 --> 30:10.916
Oh, and let me say this.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.249
I still think it's a good idea
you and the army is finished.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.384
You wasn't exactly
the soldier type of fella.

30:18.552 --> 30:20.684
I go along with the notion
seeing it's a real good idea

30:20.719 --> 30:23.456
that you end up in Cuba
some such. You hear me?

30:25.361 --> 30:26.932
- Maybe you oughta hear this.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.935
I got me and Rachel
an insurance policy.

30:30.729 --> 30:32.267
His name is Tiberio.

30:34.634 --> 30:36.106
- You know I'm married.

30:38.077 --> 30:40.737
Certainly, you know I've run off
with a man of color.

30:41.641 --> 30:44.642
I expect you think you have me
pretty well figured out.

30:48.582 --> 30:52.023
- Your husband hired me to take
you back across the border.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.322
Beyond that,
I have no opinion.

30:55.292 --> 30:57.787
- Martin Kidd is not simply
a bad husband.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.999
He's also a very bad man.

31:03.102 --> 31:05.399
- Not everyone I work for
is a saint.

31:06.666 --> 31:09.568
I took a job and I intend
to earn my money.

31:10.978 --> 31:12.769
- You live by a code?

31:13.244 --> 31:14.375
- I try.

31:14.410 --> 31:16.080
- You ever question it?

31:16.742 --> 31:18.082
- Not often.

31:19.283 --> 31:20.777
- Got a wife?

31:27.258 --> 31:29.819
- I don't think I'm a good fit
for the whole idea.

31:29.854 --> 31:30.963
- Yeah, well...

31:31.922 --> 31:33.757
- Excuse me, I gotta see
Mr. Poe.

31:44.506 --> 31:46.803
Go get something to eat,
I'll relieve you.

31:47.443 --> 31:49.575
You can spell me
in four hours, I'll wake you.

31:49.610 --> 31:52.116
- I got some information
about Elijah.

31:52.151 --> 31:53.645
The goddamn fool done made
some type of deal

31:53.680 --> 31:54.954
with that Tiberio fella.

31:56.386 --> 31:58.716
- Does... Does Mrs. Kidd
know that?

31:59.389 --> 32:02.126
- I don't know for sure,
but I expect so.

32:10.466 --> 32:12.301
- Very interesting game, poker.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.666
Sometimes, it's hard to figure

32:14.701 --> 32:18.274
when the man's bluffing
or when he's got the goods.

32:18.309 --> 32:20.309
So far,
you seem to be on your game.

32:24.348 --> 32:25.710
You know, I like to know

32:25.745 --> 32:27.613
the name of the people
I play cards with. That way,

32:27.648 --> 32:29.153
when they take my money,
it makes it that little

32:29.188 --> 32:30.517
bit more friendly.

32:30.552 --> 32:32.552
- You played here
for an hour and a half,

32:32.587 --> 32:34.719
and not knowing my name
didn't seem to bother you

32:34.754 --> 32:36.061
until I started winning.

32:36.096 --> 32:37.788
- Well, you do show some signs

32:37.823 --> 32:39.361
of being a professional
card shark.

32:39.396 --> 32:40.923
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

32:41.761 --> 32:44.696
- I'll take that
as a sign of respect.

32:44.731 --> 32:46.698
- Well, it wasn't meant
in that spirit.

32:46.733 --> 32:48.370
Now, I'd like to have a name,

32:48.405 --> 32:49.899
unless it's something
you're ashamed of.

32:49.934 --> 32:51.670
One card.

32:51.705 --> 32:52.935
- Sure thing, amigo.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.049
But I want to be real polite.

32:57.084 --> 32:58.347
You first.

32:58.844 --> 33:01.911
- With pleasure.
William Palmer Esquire,

33:01.946 --> 33:03.220
firm purchase agent for the

33:03.255 --> 33:05.013
Turnbull Mining
Properties Limited.

33:05.048 --> 33:07.257
Offices in London, Manchester,
and New Orleans.

33:07.292 --> 33:10.029
Around here, they refer to me
as Guillermo Inglés.

33:10.460 --> 33:13.494
- English Bill.
Long way from home.

33:13.529 --> 33:14.627
- Indeed.

33:16.433 --> 33:17.630
And you are?

33:18.600 --> 33:21.568
- Joe Cribbens. I'm from Texas.

33:24.705 --> 33:29.114
You seem to be a man of strong
opinions, English Bill.

33:29.149 --> 33:31.545
- Mr. Palmer, if you please.

33:32.042 --> 33:34.251
Now, let me put you on notice,
Mr. Cribbens.

33:34.286 --> 33:36.044
I'm a very, very good
card player.

33:36.079 --> 33:38.552
I do not intend to be taken in
by any tricks of your trade

33:38.587 --> 33:41.093
because I am not a man
to be taken advantage of.

33:41.128 --> 33:44.096
I can defend myself adequately
here in this rough terrain.

33:44.131 --> 33:46.263
I'm also here on business
with Mr. Tiberio Vargas,

33:46.298 --> 33:47.693
who, as you must certainly know,

33:47.728 --> 33:49.662
is lord of all he surveys
in these parts.

33:50.764 --> 33:56.031
- Now, since I think you're just
another bullshit Englishman,

33:56.066 --> 33:58.638
the kind of fella
we gringos have already

33:58.673 --> 34:00.805
whipped twice in two wars...

34:02.281 --> 34:04.611
Why don't we cut the blabber

34:04.646 --> 34:07.185
and just concentrate
on playing cards?

34:11.983 --> 34:13.455
Well, hell!

34:14.084 --> 34:18.757
English Bill. Your luck's bound
to change sometime.

34:19.298 --> 34:21.628
So, I guess I'll call.

34:22.367 --> 34:25.027
With... two itty-bitty pairs.

34:28.131 --> 34:29.471
- Son of a bitch.

34:29.506 --> 34:31.605
- Some fellas just can't get
away with a bluff.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.607
They lack the character for it.

34:33.642 --> 34:34.740
- I'll tell you this
Mr. Cribbens,

34:34.775 --> 34:36.313
you're damn lucky
I'm not wearing a gun.

34:36.348 --> 34:38.150
- And I'll tell you this,
English Bill.

34:38.185 --> 34:40.416
You're damn lucky
I don't put a bullet up your ass

34:40.451 --> 34:42.110
just on general principle.

34:42.145 --> 34:47.082
Now, if I was you,
I'd get out of my sight,

34:47.117 --> 34:49.557
before I run through
all my good humor.

36:01.268 --> 36:03.862
I have
a fugitive of the law,

36:03.897 --> 36:07.206
army deserter and extortionist.

36:11.377 --> 36:15.610
I am Max Borlund representing
the United States army.

36:15.645 --> 36:18.041
- And I am Captain
Miguel Aragon.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.076
Chief Magistrate
of Trinidad Maria.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.550
- At your service.

36:21.585 --> 36:24.113
- Who's the woman?
- I have a name.

36:25.248 --> 36:27.259
Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

36:27.294 --> 36:30.427
- You can put the prisoner
in a cell and send a telegram

36:30.462 --> 36:33.188
to the territorial deputy
in Santa Fe saying that you have

36:33.223 --> 36:36.092
a Private Elijah Jones
in your custody.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.402
- You have no jurisdiction here.

36:38.437 --> 36:40.734
- Yes. But your country's law

36:40.769 --> 36:42.967
doesn't permit deserters
of foreign armies

36:43.002 --> 36:44.738
to find safe haven.

36:44.773 --> 36:48.137
There's an honorable tradition
of extraditing men

36:48.172 --> 36:49.809
who come here
with bad intentions.

36:49.844 --> 36:51.415
- Maybe you oughta
hear this, Captain.

36:51.846 --> 36:55.419
You lock me up, Tiberio Vargas
might not like it one damn bit.

36:55.454 --> 36:57.047
- Tiberio Vargas?
- Uh-huh. Me and him

36:57.082 --> 36:59.984
were talking business before
this bounty man showed up.

37:00.657 --> 37:04.153
By the way, he killed a man.
Jack Hannon.

37:08.467 --> 37:10.302
- You killed a man?
- Yeah.

37:11.261 --> 37:15.230
American. Wanted criminal
who resisted arrest.

37:15.265 --> 37:17.540
They're witnesses.
- Yes.

37:18.708 --> 37:22.039
Mr. Borlund killed Mr. Hannon
after he put a gun to my head.

37:22.712 --> 37:25.482
Mr. Borlund probably
saved my life.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.952
We are officers
of the law.

37:35.054 --> 37:36.328
We will lock him up.

37:46.637 --> 37:48.604
- Can't say I didn't do nothing
for you, brother.

37:50.575 --> 37:52.542
- Yeah, real goddamn funny.

37:52.577 --> 37:54.379
- Well, I'll check in on you
every now and then,

37:54.414 --> 37:55.875
make sure they're
feeding you proper.

38:02.213 --> 38:05.181
- Mr. Borlund,
a word in private.

38:18.537 --> 38:20.768
- I'm sorry, Elijah.

38:22.002 --> 38:23.903
None of this
is turning out right.

38:24.444 --> 38:27.544
- Yeah. Gotta admit,

38:27.579 --> 38:30.107
Cuba's looking real far away.

38:33.948 --> 38:36.916
- My government expects me
to protect lives and property.

38:36.951 --> 38:39.215
If Tiberio Vargas becomes angry,

38:39.250 --> 38:41.349
or attempts to profit
from this situation,

38:41.384 --> 38:42.889
there could be trouble.

38:42.924 --> 38:45.595
This town is under
my jurisdiction,

38:45.630 --> 38:48.290
but out there,
Tiberio is king.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.865
There are those who come here
and then break the law.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.735
Two gringos.

38:53.770 --> 38:56.265
They were robbing local farmers,
hiding up in the mountains.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.872
Tiberio and his men
hunted them down.

38:58.907 --> 39:01.369
I let them hang
for two weeks after that.

39:01.404 --> 39:03.272
The smell gets very bad.

39:03.307 --> 39:05.109
- Did you give them a trial?

39:06.750 --> 39:08.585
- It wasn't necessary.

39:16.122 --> 39:19.090
You should go over to the
hotel and get yourself a room.

39:21.765 --> 39:25.602
- Unfortunately, I am without
sufficient funds.

39:25.637 --> 39:27.032
- Yeah, I'll take care of that

39:27.067 --> 39:29.166
after I send a telegram
to your husband.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.273
See all this mess
you done caused?

39:37.308 --> 39:39.374
Runaway woman,

39:39.409 --> 39:42.784
bounty hunter,
price on your head...

39:44.348 --> 39:46.755
And believe me, for sure,
they'd rather see you dead.

39:46.790 --> 39:48.955
- Guess I was better off
in the army all those years

39:48.990 --> 39:50.627
taking nothing but shit.

39:50.662 --> 39:53.322
And knowing if I quit the army,

39:53.357 --> 39:56.567
I ain't got much chance
of doing nothing else.

39:56.602 --> 39:59.262
Except shining shoes
or serving food.

40:00.672 --> 40:02.199
Well no, sir.

40:03.433 --> 40:05.004
No thank you.

40:47.752 --> 40:49.213
Do you speak English?

40:49.248 --> 40:50.555
- I do, Señor.

40:50.590 --> 40:52.524
- Mrs. Kidd will need a room

40:52.559 --> 40:56.528
for a few days, maybe more.
I need a room as well.

40:57.993 --> 41:00.796
- Number four, at the top
of those stairs.

41:00.831 --> 41:02.325
- Thank you.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.229
- You have number two,
across the hallway.

41:05.264 --> 41:07.264
- Thanks.
- Señor.

41:11.941 --> 41:14.238
- I suppose I should say
thank you,

41:14.273 --> 41:16.746
but then I remember
who you're working for.

41:18.442 --> 41:20.244
It doesn't seem right,

41:20.279 --> 41:22.378
Elijah being treated
like a criminal,

41:22.413 --> 41:24.182
and I'm put up in a nice hotel.

41:25.625 --> 41:28.593
- Elijah left the army,
that makes him a deserter.

41:28.628 --> 41:32.223
You left your marriage.
No one goes to jail for that.

41:54.214 --> 41:56.445
- Ah, there he is.

41:56.480 --> 42:00.416
Joe Cribbens.
Professional card shark.

42:01.793 --> 42:03.628
See, I've been considering
our card game,

42:03.663 --> 42:05.190
and I believe you cheated me.

42:05.225 --> 42:07.962
- I don't need to cheat
to beat you, amigo.

42:07.997 --> 42:10.965
- Well, this time, I brought
my service revolver

42:11.000 --> 42:14.364
and I fully intend on dealing
with the situation.

42:14.399 --> 42:17.367
Now, I suggest you give me
back my money

42:17.402 --> 42:20.073
and throw in a few extra
shillings for good measure.

42:33.187 --> 42:37.453
- Goddamn Englishman
went and committed suicide.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.376
- Esperanza, you can come in.

43:01.182 --> 43:02.951
- I thought I picked...
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:02.986 --> 43:04.986
- No, come in.
- What I wanted to discuss--

43:05.021 --> 43:06.548
- I said come in.

43:11.698 --> 43:14.523
As you can see, I'm trying
to take a bath.

43:14.558 --> 43:16.701
My first real one in weeks.

43:19.805 --> 43:21.530
What's the matter?

43:21.565 --> 43:23.004
You suspect I'm a whore,

43:23.039 --> 43:24.874
I supposed I might
as well act like one.

43:27.307 --> 43:28.845
Are you getting nervous?

43:30.244 --> 43:32.849
Maybe, like most men,

43:32.884 --> 43:37.051
you're just scared to death of
really dealing with a woman.

43:37.086 --> 43:38.723
- Are you finished?

43:41.893 --> 43:44.190
I came to let you know
that tomorrow

43:44.225 --> 43:46.225
I'll start making arrangements

43:46.260 --> 43:48.326
to have you taken back
across the border.

43:50.396 --> 43:52.561
- My life is done there.

43:52.596 --> 43:55.135
I have to move on, not go back.

43:55.170 --> 43:57.500
I appreciate your concern,

43:57.535 --> 43:59.502
but I will be the one
to figure out my life.

44:01.011 --> 44:02.043
- Mm-hmm.

44:04.410 --> 44:06.718
You refuse to go?

44:06.753 --> 44:08.852
- I refuse to go.

44:09.613 --> 44:11.723
Even at gun point.

44:15.058 --> 44:18.290
If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

44:25.365 --> 44:26.595
As you have been told,

44:26.630 --> 44:28.498
I'm here representing
Tiberio Vargas.

44:28.533 --> 44:31.270
He has already heard about this
unfortunate incident.

44:31.305 --> 44:34.603
- Look, this man tried
to kill me, came here to do it.

44:34.638 --> 44:37.749
Most likely a real shit heel
in general.

44:37.784 --> 44:40.180
I figured I was doing
everybody a favor.

44:40.215 --> 44:43.755
- We need no favors,
but possibly you do.

44:43.790 --> 44:46.417
This man you killed
was doing serious business

44:46.452 --> 44:47.715
with Tiberio Vargas.

44:47.750 --> 44:50.256
- Tiberio Vargas,
I keep hearing the name.

44:50.291 --> 44:52.896
- Mmm, you do not want him
for an enemy.

45:02.974 --> 45:04.435
- Joe Cribbens.

45:06.472 --> 45:10.507
Name's not Joseph.
Just Joe will cover the deal.

45:11.180 --> 45:13.246
I was Texas, born and bred.

45:13.281 --> 45:15.743
Been knocking around
since I was 15.

45:15.778 --> 45:18.053
Worked Teamster, worked Trooper.

45:18.088 --> 45:19.791
Drifted some.

45:19.826 --> 45:21.859
I always liked playing cards.

45:23.258 --> 45:26.193
- Tell me why you shot
this Englishman.

45:27.966 --> 45:30.758
- I beat him at cards.
I beat him fair and square.

45:30.793 --> 45:32.595
He didn't take it too good.

45:32.630 --> 45:35.268
Guess I just turned out
to be the better man.

45:35.303 --> 45:38.436
- Luis agrees the Englishman
shot first.

45:38.471 --> 45:43.441
He's an honest man.
Tiberio will consider all this.

45:43.476 --> 45:45.311
You must wait here in Guadalupe

45:45.346 --> 45:47.643
while Tiberio makes
his decision.

45:48.514 --> 45:51.713
- Damn. My luck's run bad.

46:52.182 --> 46:55.546
- Mr. Borlund. We meet again.

46:55.581 --> 46:58.923
This time, I'm happy to say
I'm not sitting in a bathtub.

46:58.958 --> 47:00.749
Do you have news?

47:00.784 --> 47:03.092
- I was just informed
a few minutes ago

47:03.127 --> 47:06.524
by Captain Aragon that
your husband is on his way here,

47:06.559 --> 47:08.427
he's travelling by coach.

47:08.462 --> 47:11.870
I am to watch over you
until he arrives.

47:17.801 --> 47:20.802
- A very bad situation
now made worse.

47:26.744 --> 47:28.381
The last time we talked,

47:28.416 --> 47:31.087
I was extremely short-tempered.
I apologize.

47:31.122 --> 47:32.748
- No apology necessary.

47:32.783 --> 47:37.456
- I've decided you need to be in
greater possession of the facts.

47:37.491 --> 47:39.722
I believe you need
to know my story.

47:40.758 --> 47:44.034
It begins with
a well-off family.

47:44.069 --> 47:46.696
I'm the youngest
of three sisters,

47:46.731 --> 47:49.138
educated by a series
of governesses.

47:49.833 --> 47:53.208
Rebellious. Didn't get along
with anybody much,

47:53.243 --> 47:55.639
including my parents
and my sisters.

47:56.939 --> 48:01.249
Fell in love at 17.
It was quite passionate.

48:02.516 --> 48:06.089
I've always resisted
traditional morality.

48:08.126 --> 48:11.160
My mother once told me,
"You only fall completely

48:11.195 --> 48:15.329
in love once, and usually,
when you're very young."

48:17.300 --> 48:19.762
She also told me,
"Almost no woman ends up

48:19.797 --> 48:21.302
with her first choice."

48:21.337 --> 48:24.206
Five years later,
I met Martin Kidd.

48:25.473 --> 48:28.606
He was charming, ambitious,

48:28.641 --> 48:31.708
seemed very rich,
and he was from the west.

48:32.975 --> 48:36.020
I desperately wanted to get away
from where I grew up.

48:36.055 --> 48:39.254
We had a quick romance, and four
weeks later, we were married.

48:39.289 --> 48:41.355
We went to live
in his home in Santa Fe.

48:42.853 --> 48:46.063
Then, the horror started.

48:47.528 --> 48:50.133
I discovered he's a crook,

48:50.168 --> 48:55.303
a conniver, an extortionist,
a land cheat.

48:55.338 --> 48:57.503
He constantly consorted
with other women,

48:57.538 --> 48:59.208
usually prostitutes.

48:59.243 --> 49:03.212
I was reduced to being
that which I most despise,

49:03.247 --> 49:05.577
a decoration wife.

49:07.251 --> 49:12.320
To my shame, I took all of it
and more for five years.

49:13.587 --> 49:16.225
There were endless fights
with Martin.

49:16.260 --> 49:20.889
Finally, he condescendingly
allowed me to start a school.

49:20.924 --> 49:25.069
I taught those who had very
little advantage in life, and...

49:27.568 --> 49:30.074
And as time passed,
I eventually became

49:30.109 --> 49:33.506
more than a teacher
with one of my students.

49:33.541 --> 49:35.343
- Elijah Jones.

49:37.611 --> 49:39.083
- Elijah Jones.

49:40.086 --> 49:43.010
He had his own set of problems.

49:43.045 --> 49:46.849
I was sympathetic.
One thing led to another.

49:46.884 --> 49:50.325
Eventually, we realized escape
was our only recourse.

49:50.360 --> 49:52.624
So we made a plan to run off.

49:53.396 --> 49:54.791
And did.

49:57.103 --> 49:58.634
I suppose you know the rest.

50:01.701 --> 50:03.470
He's a good person.

50:04.275 --> 50:07.672
And often, a great comfort to
me, but we are very different.

50:07.707 --> 50:09.542
We have no future together.

50:10.776 --> 50:13.381
We've had some good times,
but eventually,

50:13.416 --> 50:16.010
we will go our separate ways.
We both know it.

50:16.045 --> 50:17.946
Probably sooner than later.

50:19.488 --> 50:22.390
If I'm being completely honest,

50:22.425 --> 50:26.229
Elijah was not the first
of my romantic adventures

50:26.264 --> 50:27.923
since I married Martin.

50:28.959 --> 50:31.465
Most were in simple retaliation.

50:35.504 --> 50:37.735
Well, I think I've done
enough confessing.

50:40.509 --> 50:43.840
I want you to think of me
as an honest person.

50:44.843 --> 50:46.744
However, imperfect.

50:46.779 --> 50:48.911
I want you to think of me
as an honest person,

50:48.946 --> 50:51.122
because I believe
that matters to you.

50:51.157 --> 50:55.126
I just want to say this,
for the record.

50:57.922 --> 51:02.925
When my husband gets here,
he intends to kill me.

51:14.807 --> 51:16.741
- I know you heard
Mrs. Kidd and the others

51:16.776 --> 51:17.973
can't come visit you.

51:19.614 --> 51:21.977
- Anybody bother
giving a reason?

51:22.012 --> 51:24.078
Just when we're kicking
the balls for Elijah.

51:24.113 --> 51:27.818
- Captain Aragon said the bounty
man and me has jurisdiction.

51:27.853 --> 51:30.194
Ain't nobody else allowed.
- Yeah.

51:31.329 --> 51:33.263
Just one more kick
in the balls, huh.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.364
- Quit feeling sorry
for yourself.

51:35.399 --> 51:36.959
It don't help a damn thing.

51:37.863 --> 51:40.798
And you know Mr. Kidd himself
is on the way up here right now.

51:42.472 --> 51:44.175
- Yeah.

51:44.804 --> 51:46.210
Oh yeah, I heard.

51:46.806 --> 51:49.180
Captain Aragon told me.

51:49.215 --> 51:51.644
You know, I just figure
he's bringing the ransom money

51:51.679 --> 51:53.712
in a... personal way.

51:53.747 --> 51:56.187
- More likely he coming up
to settle things with you.

51:56.222 --> 51:58.145
Now, I gotta figure out a way
how I'm a bust you up

51:58.180 --> 52:00.389
out of here and get you on your
way to some half-ass freedom.

52:01.018 --> 52:02.358
Now first...

52:02.756 --> 52:04.327
And you gotta do this...

52:06.155 --> 52:07.990
Forget this white woman.

52:08.432 --> 52:09.827
You travelling with her,
you get spotted

52:09.862 --> 52:11.895
real easy and you finished.

52:11.930 --> 52:14.370
Plus, I gotta figure out a way
how I'm gonna stay clean.

52:14.405 --> 52:16.130
Because I plans to be
going back home,

52:16.165 --> 52:18.033
-and I'm going back to the army.
- That's what it is.

52:18.068 --> 52:20.244
Don't let nothing interfere
with what's good for Alonzo Poe.

52:20.279 --> 52:21.575
- You goddamn right!

52:21.610 --> 52:22.906
Because I sure as shit
ain't finna go

52:22.941 --> 52:24.413
outlaw for a dumbass like you.

52:24.448 --> 52:26.382
You've already caused me
enough grief.

52:28.518 --> 52:30.848
Now, keep your mouth shut,
keep your eyes open,

52:30.883 --> 52:32.916
and boy, you better pray...

52:32.951 --> 52:35.050
that I can do you
some real good.

52:46.701 --> 52:48.437
Mr. Borlund,

52:48.472 --> 52:50.439
I figured I'd take
the horses out for exercise.

52:50.474 --> 52:52.771
Wanna keep 'em fit.

52:52.806 --> 52:54.707
- Very good, Mr. Poe.

52:54.742 --> 52:56.313
- Yes, sir.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.548
Boots and saddle, slap leather
and ride.

53:00.583 --> 53:01.615
That's our motto.

53:02.816 --> 53:05.718
I'm a cavalry man.
So I sticks to it.

53:07.249 --> 53:09.227
- Sergeant Poe.
- Yes, sir.

53:10.824 --> 53:13.264
- With the prisoner
Elijah Jones...

53:14.091 --> 53:15.398
- Yes, sir.

53:15.961 --> 53:17.532
- Don't do anything stupid

53:17.567 --> 53:20.095
like try to break him out
of jail and set him free.

53:21.164 --> 53:22.240
- Yes, sir.

53:23.001 --> 53:24.407
Why would you think that?

53:24.442 --> 53:25.705
- Because you're not as clever

53:25.740 --> 53:28.070
and I'm not as stupid
as you imagine.

53:30.481 --> 53:33.482
- Yes, sir. I mean... No, sir.

53:39.281 --> 53:42.260
- The time to do it
is when step back to the border.

53:44.858 --> 53:46.957
- Now I'm a little
confused here. Uh...

53:49.830 --> 53:51.335
You mean...

53:51.865 --> 53:54.063
- I mean, this whole job
is a lie

53:54.098 --> 53:55.669
and it started as a lie.

53:55.704 --> 53:58.870
I don't like being lied to
and I don't like being used.

54:01.138 --> 54:02.742
- You're gonna help me
let Elijah go?

54:02.777 --> 54:04.106
- You have my word.

54:04.713 --> 54:05.976
- Well, sir...

54:07.452 --> 54:09.243
Sure is full of surprises.

54:09.278 --> 54:10.277
- Yeah.

54:15.119 --> 54:16.558
- Look who's coming.

54:25.404 --> 54:28.570
- Tiberio wants to start
negotiating about Elijah.

54:33.544 --> 54:35.203
Yeah, I'll handle the diplomacy.

54:35.238 --> 54:37.040
You go and cause
a little trouble.

54:37.075 --> 54:40.109
I don't want Tiberio
to think we're pushover.

54:40.144 --> 54:41.847
How about I go tell
Mr. Peckerwood

54:41.882 --> 54:43.145
over there a thing or two?

54:43.180 --> 54:45.048
Seeing that he was
kind of insulting me...

54:46.084 --> 54:47.523
- Yeah, go ahead.

54:48.559 --> 54:49.888
Try not to kill him.

54:49.923 --> 54:51.219
- Yes, sir.

54:51.254 --> 54:53.991
- I'll go have a drink
and wait for Esteban.

55:23.792 --> 55:26.056
Well,
howdy, Tyree.

55:26.091 --> 55:27.695
Say, you remember me, right?

55:27.730 --> 55:29.356
The fellow with the gun?

55:29.391 --> 55:31.897
- Yeah. Out there
at the water hole.

55:31.932 --> 55:33.228
- That's right.

55:33.263 --> 55:35.472
- I see you still got
a real smart mouth.

55:35.936 --> 55:37.936
You need to learn some manners.

55:37.971 --> 55:41.236
Maybe I ought to bullwhip me
a real uppity fella.

55:41.271 --> 55:43.480
Just might do you some good.

55:45.748 --> 55:48.947
- Now, Jack, I know you ain't
the smartest man I ever met,

55:50.115 --> 55:54.084
but maybe you forgot that
I'm the one carrying the gun.

55:54.119 --> 55:55.492
- Yeah, well...

55:56.253 --> 55:58.286
Go ahead and shoot me.

55:58.321 --> 55:59.562
And those fellows over there...

56:00.730 --> 56:02.961
...well, they'll shoot you.

56:05.570 --> 56:08.406
- Señor Borlund,
we meet another time.

56:10.102 --> 56:14.170
I'm afraid Tiberio has now heard
you're a bounty man, yes?

56:15.305 --> 56:17.481
He thought you were
looking for gold.

56:18.440 --> 56:21.309
- Well, he'll just have to learn
to live with the truth.

56:30.694 --> 56:31.924
Thank you.

56:33.598 --> 56:35.895
- Tiberio feels he was deceived.

56:35.930 --> 56:37.897
You should know this...

56:37.932 --> 56:41.098
Tiberio has made a business
arrangement with your prisoner.

56:43.872 --> 56:45.168
- I'm aware of that.

56:46.435 --> 56:50.371
But due to circumstances,
that deal is null and void.

57:00.020 --> 57:03.384
- That... idea will be
unacceptable.

57:04.563 --> 57:07.861
5,000 dollars American
is owed to him.

57:08.831 --> 57:10.600
- You know what?

57:10.635 --> 57:13.537
Goddamit, Jack, you're right.

57:13.572 --> 57:14.967
You're right.

57:15.002 --> 57:17.299
Because I occasionally
keep one of these handy

57:17.334 --> 57:20.038
when I gotta bullwhip me
some damn yokel.

57:26.211 --> 57:28.475
First five years in the army,
they had me working Teamster.

57:28.510 --> 57:31.478
And I was cracking one of these
every day of the week.

58:19.033 --> 58:20.934
- Lucky son of a bitch.

58:26.271 --> 58:27.644
- Señor Borlund...

58:28.812 --> 58:30.911
My advice is for you
and your companion

58:30.946 --> 58:33.045
to go immediately
from this place.

58:33.080 --> 58:35.212
Leave Trinidad Maria at once,

58:35.247 --> 58:37.720
but leave Mrs. Kidd
and Elijah behind.

58:37.755 --> 58:39.986
- That's good advice. No.

58:41.121 --> 58:45.288
You can explain to Señor Tiberio
that I am a man of the law.

58:46.764 --> 58:48.896
And Elijah is a criminal.

59:18.521 --> 59:20.631
- You don't much like me,
do you, Mr. Poe?

59:21.590 --> 59:23.799
- I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

59:23.834 --> 59:26.329
And Mr. Borlund told me that
I need to watch over you, now.

59:26.364 --> 59:28.364
- It's because of Elijah,
isn't it?

59:29.675 --> 59:31.774
You hold the trouble
he's in against me.

59:32.469 --> 59:34.436
I understand that.

59:34.471 --> 59:36.614
But I take it,
despite everything...

59:37.639 --> 59:39.507
...you still like Elijah.

59:41.445 --> 59:43.313
- He's awful mad at me.

59:43.348 --> 59:44.820
Thinks I let him down.

59:46.890 --> 59:48.956
I still count him as a friend.

59:51.895 --> 59:55.930
- And now, we have these events
that really irritate Tiberio.

59:55.965 --> 59:59.802
The situation with this Señora
Kidd is<i> muy complicada.</i>

59:59.837 --> 1:00:02.464
This man makes things difficult
for Tiberio,

1:00:02.499 --> 1:00:06.501
he has little authority over
the situation in Trinidad Maria.

1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:09.647
- This legal fellow got a name?

1:00:10.540 --> 1:00:12.881
- He's called Señor Max Borlund.

1:00:14.544 --> 1:00:16.951
- Uh, say that again.

1:00:16.986 --> 1:00:18.821
- Señor Max Borlund.

1:00:18.856 --> 1:00:21.153
He's a private investigator.

1:00:23.025 --> 1:00:24.926
- I know the man.

1:00:28.261 --> 1:00:30.701
You see this, Esteban?

1:00:30.736 --> 1:00:33.165
You put a gun in it,

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.706
and it's the devil's right hand.

1:00:49.348 --> 1:00:51.051
- I would like to see Elijah.

1:00:51.086 --> 1:00:53.350
You have him in that cell there.

1:00:53.385 --> 1:00:54.923
- Not possible, Señora.

1:00:54.958 --> 1:00:56.485
The prisoner will have
no visitors

1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:58.553
until his legal status
is determined.

1:00:58.588 --> 1:01:00.159
He's in my custody, but...

1:01:00.194 --> 1:01:02.898
under the jurisdiction
of Mr. Borlund.

1:01:02.933 --> 1:01:04.559
- Mr...

1:01:14.274 --> 1:01:16.274
- I'll need my key, please.

1:01:16.309 --> 1:01:19.211
- Did you have a pleasant walk?
- I did not.

1:01:19.246 --> 1:01:21.609
My friend is in jail and they
refuse to let me see him.

1:01:21.644 --> 1:01:23.281
Entirely because of Mr. Borlund.

1:01:23.316 --> 1:01:24.953
- Señora.

1:01:24.988 --> 1:01:27.989
This was left for you
by Mr. Borlund.

1:01:34.723 --> 1:01:36.734
- Elijah's gun and mine.

1:01:39.563 --> 1:01:42.300
Mr. Borlund is a man
of surprises.

1:02:12.596 --> 1:02:14.332
- Hola, Tiberio.

1:02:15.665 --> 1:02:17.269
- You were expecting me.

1:02:17.304 --> 1:02:18.600
- Yes, sir.

1:02:18.635 --> 1:02:20.602
After my friendly talk
with Esteban,

1:02:20.637 --> 1:02:23.781
I figured you might wanna
get to know Joe Cribbens.

1:02:24.806 --> 1:02:26.608
I hear all the news and gossip

1:02:26.643 --> 1:02:30.150
since I've been staying in this
near-ghost town of yours.

1:02:31.054 --> 1:02:33.714
I even hear you're up against
Max Borlund.

1:02:34.486 --> 1:02:36.651
He's a man with a reputation.

1:02:37.621 --> 1:02:39.192
And I owe him.

1:02:39.227 --> 1:02:40.864
- You owe him?

1:02:40.899 --> 1:02:42.228
A favor?

1:02:43.231 --> 1:02:45.000
- No,<i> jefe.</i>

1:02:45.035 --> 1:02:46.903
He's not my amigo.

1:02:47.730 --> 1:02:49.301
<i>- Oy, hombre.</i>

1:02:52.504 --> 1:02:56.539
Why don't you tell me about
this... Max Borlund?

1:02:56.574 --> 1:02:59.509
Then, afterwards, maybe I have
somebody shoot you.

1:03:01.315 --> 1:03:03.216
- Have I offended you,<i> jefe?</i>

1:03:03.251 --> 1:03:04.811
- You killed the Englishman.

1:03:04.846 --> 1:03:07.990
He was doing a land contract
with me for many pesos.

1:03:08.025 --> 1:03:10.520
- He accused me of cheating.
- Were you guilty?

1:03:10.555 --> 1:03:12.555
- I didn't need to cheat him.

1:03:13.426 --> 1:03:15.228
I'm a good card player.

1:03:16.363 --> 1:03:18.066
- So am I,<i> hombre.</i>

1:03:18.101 --> 1:03:19.694
So am I.

1:03:32.918 --> 1:03:34.412
- Three cards.

1:03:50.562 --> 1:03:53.101
I wanna see what you have,
<i>jefe.</i>

1:03:54.896 --> 1:03:56.137
- I have the winner.

1:03:58.372 --> 1:04:00.735
- Ah... Sorry,<i> jefe.</i>

1:04:06.050 --> 1:04:08.314
- Most men are afraid
to beat me at cards.

1:04:08.954 --> 1:04:10.481
To take my money.

1:04:11.913 --> 1:04:14.551
- If I lost on purpose,
I'd be insulting you.

1:04:15.422 --> 1:04:18.852
This way, I prove I respect
the way you honor a game

1:04:18.887 --> 1:04:21.261
of skill and good fortune.

1:04:22.495 --> 1:04:23.758
<i>- Americano?</i>

1:04:24.629 --> 1:04:26.970
<i>- Americano,</i> from Texas.

1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:33.273
- I decide not to kill you.

1:04:33.308 --> 1:04:35.209
I decide to use you.

1:04:35.244 --> 1:04:37.277
<i>Oy, hombre,</i>
I don't like to lose money.

1:04:37.312 --> 1:04:38.740
Another game.

1:04:38.775 --> 1:04:40.280
But understand this:

1:04:40.315 --> 1:04:42.183
Now, you work for me.

1:04:43.021 --> 1:04:44.680
You will follow orders.

1:05:10.774 --> 1:05:14.710
- Old man, go find the gringo
bounty man.

1:05:15.548 --> 1:05:18.153
Tell him to prepare
to go to hell.

1:05:18.188 --> 1:05:20.353
Tell him I intend to kill him.

1:06:08.568 --> 1:06:10.238
Joe Cribbens.

1:06:10.273 --> 1:06:11.800
What, you know him?

1:06:11.835 --> 1:06:13.538
- He's a dangerous man.

1:06:14.541 --> 1:06:16.739
- You ain't got nothing
to worry about.

1:06:16.774 --> 1:06:19.412
He kill you, I kill him.

1:06:29.853 --> 1:06:32.095
- I hear you're breaking
your promise.

1:06:32.130 --> 1:06:33.756
You're looking for me,
after all.

1:06:33.791 --> 1:06:36.429
- Yeah. Time and circumstance.

1:06:36.464 --> 1:06:39.036
Besides, it's a long
time coming.

1:06:40.105 --> 1:06:42.699
I got lots of personal feelings
against you, Mr. Borlund,

1:06:42.734 --> 1:06:44.998
but that's not why I'm here.

1:06:45.033 --> 1:06:47.407
Right now, I'm just getting
paid to do a job.

1:06:48.707 --> 1:06:52.445
But first, since this
is a special occasion,

1:06:53.481 --> 1:06:55.382
I guess I'd...

1:06:55.417 --> 1:06:57.417
kind of like to have me a drink.

1:07:11.928 --> 1:07:13.598
Time to settle up.

1:07:13.633 --> 1:07:16.205
I like to pay off what I owe.

1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:18.537
You low-rate me, Mr. Borlund.

1:07:18.572 --> 1:07:20.209
Always have.

1:07:20.244 --> 1:07:23.036
So, before I lay you low,

1:07:23.071 --> 1:07:26.479
I'm gonna teach you
how to show me a little respect.

1:07:27.944 --> 1:07:29.009
Have one.

1:07:30.188 --> 1:07:31.748
- Skip the bullshit.

1:07:32.586 --> 1:07:34.685
But you can tell me
who's paying you.

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:37.226
- Figure you already
know the answer.

1:07:37.261 --> 1:07:39.591
- Oh, Tiberio's got you
doing the dirty work.

1:07:39.626 --> 1:07:41.725
- Tiberio's got me doing
the hard work.

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:43.496
See it as a compliment.

1:07:43.531 --> 1:07:44.761
- I was expecting you was trying

1:07:44.796 --> 1:07:46.928
to come in on Mr. Borlund's
bounty money.

1:07:46.963 --> 1:07:49.667
- I don't make my pesos
that way.

1:07:51.099 --> 1:07:53.671
I've done a few things
not on the square.

1:07:54.509 --> 1:07:56.377
But I never sink that low.

1:08:02.044 --> 1:08:03.186
Well...

1:08:08.325 --> 1:08:10.622
If you're not gonna
drink with me...

1:08:11.889 --> 1:08:13.460
I guess it's time...

1:08:14.529 --> 1:08:16.496
...to see how good
you really are.

1:08:16.531 --> 1:08:18.168
- Gonna have to take us both.

1:08:19.501 --> 1:08:21.666
- Your move, Joe.
- Gentlemen.

1:08:25.309 --> 1:08:28.475
My name is Rachel Kidd,
if it's of any interest.

1:08:28.510 --> 1:08:30.136
- Don't be getting in this,
ma'am.

1:08:30.171 --> 1:08:34.107
- He's right, Mrs. Kidd.
You best back away.

1:08:34.142 --> 1:08:36.285
- Mr. Borlund and I
have our differences.

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:38.045
But he doesn't deserve
to be gunned down

1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:39.849
by a common criminal.

1:08:39.884 --> 1:08:42.456
- Oh, I'm not so common, ma'am.

1:08:42.491 --> 1:08:45.888
And even though you seem to
have a real unpleasant nature,

1:08:45.923 --> 1:08:48.858
I'd still hate to put
the finish on a woman.

1:08:49.498 --> 1:08:52.532
It ain't my style.

1:08:52.567 --> 1:08:55.095
- At this distance,
I don't think I'm going to miss.

1:08:56.197 --> 1:08:58.802
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

1:08:58.837 --> 1:09:00.870
I will not lose my nerve.

1:09:00.905 --> 1:09:02.707
I will pull the trigger.

1:09:02.742 --> 1:09:04.544
I promise.

1:09:13.390 --> 1:09:15.324
- You proud?

1:09:15.359 --> 1:09:18.921
Hiding behind a backup gun
and a woman.

1:09:19.726 --> 1:09:21.154
- Tell you what, Joe.

1:09:21.189 --> 1:09:23.563
I think I'd ride on out
before she gets nervous

1:09:23.598 --> 1:09:25.961
and accidentally
pulls the trigger.

1:09:27.602 --> 1:09:29.063
- Okay, amigo.

1:09:32.541 --> 1:09:35.036
I guess this hand goes to you.

1:09:35.071 --> 1:09:38.611
But... this ain't over yet.

1:09:52.594 --> 1:09:55.430
- Told you. Ain't got
nothing to worry about.

1:09:56.928 --> 1:09:59.269
- Once again, Mr. Poe,
very good.

1:10:00.338 --> 1:10:02.767
- Once good, I aim to please.

1:10:13.780 --> 1:10:17.419
- Guess it was a good thing
you gave me back my gun.

1:10:17.454 --> 1:10:20.114
- Joe was right.
This isn't over.

1:10:20.149 --> 1:10:24.393
But I appreciate what you did,
even though it was very foolish.

1:10:24.428 --> 1:10:27.660
- You probably saved my life
back in the cabin.

1:10:27.695 --> 1:10:29.464
I owed you.

1:10:29.499 --> 1:10:31.026
I try to pay my debts.

1:10:32.337 --> 1:10:34.832
I don't really drink,
but I think I need this.

1:10:45.647 --> 1:10:48.813
- Come to check
on the deserter man.

1:10:48.848 --> 1:10:51.618
- How long you figure
before Rachel's husband arrives?

1:10:52.489 --> 1:10:54.148
- About another day or two.

1:10:56.284 --> 1:10:58.218
- He better be bringing
his money.

1:11:48.578 --> 1:11:50.072
- Driver!

1:11:50.107 --> 1:11:51.414
Why in the hell
are we stopping?

1:11:51.449 --> 1:11:53.174
It's the middle of nowhere.

1:11:54.551 --> 1:11:56.177
- Hello, ladies.

1:11:56.212 --> 1:11:58.014
Martin Kidd, right?

1:11:59.050 --> 1:12:01.017
You step on out
and come with me.

1:12:01.052 --> 1:12:02.722
<i>Por favor.</i>

1:12:02.757 --> 1:12:05.461
Mr. Tiberio Vargas would like
to have a talk with you.

1:12:24.581 --> 1:12:29.045
I... speak English
a little bit.

1:12:29.883 --> 1:12:31.784
But only when I want to.

1:13:21.297 --> 1:13:22.362
<i>- Vamos.</i>

1:13:26.467 --> 1:13:29.402
- Mr. Kidd.
- Mr. Borlund!

1:13:29.437 --> 1:13:32.306
You're my welcoming party.
It's good to see you.

1:13:32.341 --> 1:13:33.945
How's my wife?

1:13:33.980 --> 1:13:36.409
- She's in the hotel
down the road.

1:13:36.444 --> 1:13:39.852
- Oh, that's where she is,
but how is she?

1:13:39.887 --> 1:13:43.526
- The past few weeks have been
very difficult for her.

1:13:44.562 --> 1:13:45.858
- And Elijah Jones?

1:13:45.893 --> 1:13:48.289
- He's in a jail cell
around the corner.

1:13:48.324 --> 1:13:52.029
- Good. I'll go visit Rachel
in due course,

1:13:52.064 --> 1:13:55.197
I'm in no hurry to deal
with her salacious conduct.

1:13:56.497 --> 1:13:59.366
Have you met this
Tiberio Vargas?

1:13:59.401 --> 1:14:02.204
- Only once.
- He's quite a fellow.

1:14:03.504 --> 1:14:06.648
Well, I owe you a debt
of gratitude

1:14:06.683 --> 1:14:08.551
for rounding up
these two runaways.

1:14:08.586 --> 1:14:10.014
- You owe me money.

1:14:10.049 --> 1:14:12.489
- Oh, I do. And you'll be paid.

1:14:13.316 --> 1:14:14.524
Paid in full.

1:14:58.933 --> 1:15:01.263
- If I may join you,
I wish to discuss with you

1:15:01.298 --> 1:15:03.540
the situation we find
ourselves in.

1:15:04.136 --> 1:15:05.674
- Then...

1:15:05.709 --> 1:15:08.534
I guess we oughta
discuss Tiberio,

1:15:08.569 --> 1:15:10.712
since nobody around here
can take a piss

1:15:10.747 --> 1:15:12.373
without him saying so.

1:15:12.408 --> 1:15:14.683
- Tiberio is of course
disappointed.

1:15:14.718 --> 1:15:16.949
He feels your tactics
were too bold.

1:15:16.984 --> 1:15:19.380
You were foolish and arrogant.

1:15:20.757 --> 1:15:23.087
I am here to tell you that

1:15:23.122 --> 1:15:26.156
Tiberio has no further need
of your services.

1:15:28.798 --> 1:15:30.490
You are dismissed.

1:15:31.966 --> 1:15:33.636
You're free to go.

1:16:29.056 --> 1:16:32.519
- One thing about you and
your kind, Mr. Cockroach,

1:16:32.554 --> 1:16:34.488
can't get rid of you, can we?

1:16:36.030 --> 1:16:38.833
Yes, sir, you sons of bitches

1:16:38.868 --> 1:16:42.166
must be first cousin
with Mr. Boll Weevil.

1:16:43.235 --> 1:16:45.466
And that means nothing much
good to be said.

1:16:46.304 --> 1:16:48.238
Just a goddamn nuisance.

1:17:12.330 --> 1:17:13.527
- Mr. Borlund.

1:17:14.068 --> 1:17:16.596
- Have you seen
your husband yet?

1:17:18.270 --> 1:17:22.008
I think he made some kind
of a deal with Tiberio Vargas,

1:17:22.043 --> 1:17:23.537
probably about you.

1:17:23.572 --> 1:17:25.880
I just wanted to make sure
you're alright.

1:17:28.577 --> 1:17:31.248
- I saw his arrival on
the overland from the parlor.

1:17:32.515 --> 1:17:35.384
It cost me a difficult moment.

1:17:35.419 --> 1:17:38.090
But I'm fine, Mr. Borlund.
Thank you for your concern.

1:17:41.293 --> 1:17:42.699
Just a moment.

1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:54.403
My last will and testament.

1:17:54.438 --> 1:17:57.043
My lawyer's name is on
the front of the envelope.

1:17:57.078 --> 1:17:59.749
To be delivered
in the event of my death.

1:18:17.725 --> 1:18:19.230
Yeah.

1:18:19.265 --> 1:18:20.770
Must be getting me
out of here.

1:18:20.805 --> 1:18:22.772
You know, I figured Tiberio

1:18:22.807 --> 1:18:26.776
would see the light.
Me and him, we got business.

1:18:32.850 --> 1:18:34.751
- Hello, Elijah.

1:18:36.150 --> 1:18:37.644
- Mr. Kidd.

1:18:39.956 --> 1:18:41.615
Now, uh...

1:18:44.587 --> 1:18:47.060
I can't say I expected you
to come down here.

1:18:47.095 --> 1:18:49.590
- No small talk, Elijah.

1:18:49.625 --> 1:18:51.262
It's time to pay you off.

1:18:54.135 --> 1:18:55.904
You gonna shoot
an unarmed man?

1:18:55.939 --> 1:18:57.807
- Yeah.

1:19:04.882 --> 1:19:06.849
Put a gun
in his hand.

1:19:06.884 --> 1:19:08.950
You open that cell door.

1:19:09.810 --> 1:19:11.447
He was trying to escape.

1:19:36.210 --> 1:19:37.308
He was dead

1:19:37.343 --> 1:19:39.079
when he fell to the floor
of his cell.

1:19:41.545 --> 1:19:42.984
- Poor Elijah.

1:19:57.528 --> 1:20:00.067
- Ah, Mr. Borlund. I expect
you've heard the news.

1:20:00.102 --> 1:20:03.939
US Army Private Elijah Jones
is no longer a problem.

1:20:04.436 --> 1:20:07.338
- How much did it cost
Mr. Kidd to commit this murder?

1:20:07.373 --> 1:20:09.472
- I'm investigating
these circumstances.

1:20:09.507 --> 1:20:11.705
- I am confused, Mr. Borlund.

1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:13.476
Who do you think
you're working for?

1:20:13.511 --> 1:20:16.215
- I work for myself.
Always have.

1:20:16.921 --> 1:20:18.580
- I was dishonored.

1:20:18.615 --> 1:20:20.890
A wife is not supposed
to run away from her husband

1:20:20.925 --> 1:20:22.518
with a common soldier.

1:20:22.553 --> 1:20:24.586
- You mean common
Black soldiers?

1:20:25.688 --> 1:20:27.754
- Yeah, that's exactly
what I mean.

1:20:27.789 --> 1:20:31.296
Common... Black... soldiers.

1:20:32.299 --> 1:20:34.068
- I tell you again,
I'm investigating--

1:21:33.195 --> 1:21:35.624
I'd like to see
my wife, Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

1:21:35.659 --> 1:21:37.934
Can you tell me her room number?

1:21:39.135 --> 1:21:40.970
- She's in number 4.

1:21:41.005 --> 1:21:42.697
Up the stairs.

1:22:06.459 --> 1:22:07.964
- Martin.

1:22:10.727 --> 1:22:15.334
- I am, uh... a bit slow
on coming to see you.

1:22:15.369 --> 1:22:17.336
Of course, there's no point
in pretending

1:22:17.371 --> 1:22:20.669
that there's any affection
between us, is there?

1:22:20.704 --> 1:22:23.177
- No. None at all.

1:22:25.313 --> 1:22:26.807
I take it you owe Mr. Borlund

1:22:26.842 --> 1:22:29.051
a great deal of money
for finding me.

1:22:29.086 --> 1:22:31.317
- Mr. Borlund will receive
what he's earned.

1:22:31.352 --> 1:22:34.617
- Just like Elijah?
Did he receive what he earned?

1:22:34.652 --> 1:22:37.323
- Uh, no. I was too good to him.
He died a quick death.

1:22:37.358 --> 1:22:39.556
- You are despicable, Martin.

1:22:42.594 --> 1:22:44.033
- You're breaking marriage vows.

1:22:44.068 --> 1:22:46.233
You run away with
an army deserter

1:22:46.268 --> 1:22:49.731
who's also a criminal low-life
demanding ransom money

1:22:49.766 --> 1:22:51.568
for your services to him
as a whore.

1:22:51.603 --> 1:22:54.373
You come very close
to jeopardizing my future

1:22:54.408 --> 1:22:56.507
political career
with this lurid scandal,

1:22:56.542 --> 1:22:59.411
and then you tell me
that I'm despicable?

1:22:59.446 --> 1:23:00.610
- I was stupid.

1:23:01.514 --> 1:23:03.151
I made bad situations worse

1:23:03.186 --> 1:23:04.911
which caused terrible
things to happen.

1:23:04.946 --> 1:23:06.682
I have no excuse.

1:23:06.717 --> 1:23:08.090
You just wanted legitimacy

1:23:08.125 --> 1:23:09.982
and the security
of my future inheritance.

1:23:10.017 --> 1:23:11.225
We never loved each other.

1:23:11.260 --> 1:23:12.820
- Hmm.
- It was all just

1:23:12.855 --> 1:23:14.360
mutual convenience.

1:23:14.395 --> 1:23:16.824
- I intend to return to Santa Fe

1:23:16.859 --> 1:23:19.563
where the story'll be put out
in the newspapers

1:23:19.598 --> 1:23:22.236
how I killed my wife's abductor
in a heroic act,

1:23:22.271 --> 1:23:24.403
but that she was unfortunately
captured and killed

1:23:24.438 --> 1:23:26.603
by a gang of Mexican outlaws,

1:23:26.638 --> 1:23:29.375
killed after, you know,
being used by them

1:23:29.410 --> 1:23:31.740
in the lowest possible ways.

1:23:31.775 --> 1:23:32.741
- Good story.

1:23:32.776 --> 1:23:34.248
Sad thing is a lot of people

1:23:34.283 --> 1:23:35.513
will probably believe it.

1:23:35.548 --> 1:23:37.009
- It's gonna be quite close
to the truth.

1:23:37.044 --> 1:23:39.451
Given your appetite,
you might enjoy being fucked

1:23:39.486 --> 1:23:43.884
up, down and sideways by those
<i>vaqueros</i> before they kill you.

1:23:43.919 --> 1:23:45.424
They will of course kill you.

1:23:45.459 --> 1:23:49.824
No, it's part of my
understanding with Señor Vargas.

1:23:50.662 --> 1:23:53.432
- You think I'll go willingly?
- Oh no.

1:23:54.237 --> 1:23:57.865
But these men are quite
happy to use force.

1:23:57.900 --> 1:23:59.999
And you have nowhere to hide.

1:24:02.069 --> 1:24:06.313
I'll leave you now
to think about your future.

1:24:08.614 --> 1:24:11.186
- I don't think it's going
to work out the way you want.

1:24:13.982 --> 1:24:15.949
- You won't do it.

1:24:15.984 --> 1:24:18.556
You don't actually
have the nerve to kill a man.

1:24:18.591 --> 1:24:20.129
- I've changed.

1:24:20.164 --> 1:24:23.022
And you always underestimate me.

1:24:24.091 --> 1:24:26.729
- I repeat... You won't do--

1:24:50.788 --> 1:24:52.722
I heard a shot!
Are you...

1:24:55.397 --> 1:24:57.364
- I've killed my husband.

1:25:00.336 --> 1:25:02.699
- Well, you gave him
what he deserved.

1:25:02.734 --> 1:25:04.569
He killed Elijah.

1:25:06.133 --> 1:25:07.473
- Yes.

1:25:09.345 --> 1:25:11.070
I'm not sorry.

1:26:34.155 --> 1:26:35.990
Knock next time!

1:28:38.048 --> 1:28:39.245
I assume...

1:28:39.951 --> 1:28:42.182
...you intend to defend
Mrs. Kidd?

1:28:42.217 --> 1:28:44.217
- And I imagine you have
a nice safe spot

1:28:44.252 --> 1:28:45.757
picked out for yourself.

1:28:45.792 --> 1:28:47.759
- I will ignore your insult.

1:28:48.729 --> 1:28:50.762
And I promise you
I will do my duty today

1:28:50.797 --> 1:28:52.159
as an officer of the law.

1:28:52.194 --> 1:28:54.634
- Just like you did
with Elijah Jones?

1:28:55.395 --> 1:28:57.131
- That was my mistake.

1:28:57.771 --> 1:29:00.706
I should have realized Mr. Kidd
intended to kill Elijah.

1:29:01.808 --> 1:29:03.412
He bribed my deputy.

1:29:06.142 --> 1:29:07.449
I am ashamed.

1:33:01.608 --> 1:33:03.410
I'm taking you
out, mister.

1:33:03.445 --> 1:33:05.852
- Alright then,
go ahead and try.

1:34:32.435 --> 1:34:34.600
I thought
that you were smarter...

1:34:37.242 --> 1:34:39.539
...than getting
in the middle of this.

1:34:50.552 --> 1:34:53.157
Ride out of here
before I decide to shoot you.

1:34:53.797 --> 1:34:55.830
- I thank you for your
courtesy and kindness.

1:35:28.788 --> 1:35:30.425
- Tiberio Vargas!

1:35:52.350 --> 1:35:53.822
Yah!

1:36:14.174 --> 1:36:15.635
- Tiberio!

1:36:16.077 --> 1:36:17.604
Just want to tell you,

1:36:17.639 --> 1:36:19.672
since I'm not working
for you anymore,

1:36:19.707 --> 1:36:22.180
I think you're shit.

1:36:22.215 --> 1:36:23.709
Always did.

1:36:36.196 --> 1:36:37.558
Guess what?

1:36:37.593 --> 1:36:39.791
I did you a favor, bounty man.

1:36:39.826 --> 1:36:43.498
You're gonna thank me
for killing my old boss?

1:36:45.370 --> 1:36:47.942
He was gonna spoil
my fun with you.

1:36:50.573 --> 1:36:52.914
- About time you did
something good.

1:37:01.881 --> 1:37:04.024
You know, you can
ride out of here, Joe.

1:37:06.094 --> 1:37:08.358
- I took his money.

1:37:08.393 --> 1:37:10.063
Maybe ought to earn it.

1:37:11.297 --> 1:37:14.364
Besides, there's no avoiding it.

1:37:15.301 --> 1:37:17.499
You and me got a reckoning.

1:37:17.534 --> 1:37:21.338
- I'm giving you a clean start.
Don't be a damn fool!

1:37:21.373 --> 1:37:23.406
- Amigo...

1:37:23.441 --> 1:37:25.375
I was born a fool.

1:37:33.451 --> 1:37:35.385
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1:37:36.993 --> 1:37:38.586
You killed me.

1:37:43.791 --> 1:37:45.395
Luck ran out.

1:37:47.300 --> 1:37:49.234
I'm just dying.

1:37:52.140 --> 1:37:54.206
Happens to us all.

1:37:54.241 --> 1:37:55.438
Don't it?

1:38:21.004 --> 1:38:22.399
- Mr. Poe.

1:38:24.370 --> 1:38:26.436
- Mr. Borlund.

1:38:33.346 --> 1:38:35.610
- I'm gonna make sure
that your body gets sent

1:38:35.645 --> 1:38:38.316
back to the army. They'll give
you a proper finish,

1:38:38.351 --> 1:38:40.318
bugle, flags...

1:38:40.353 --> 1:38:41.814
A man can do worse.

1:38:41.849 --> 1:38:43.783
- Goddamit. I...

1:38:43.818 --> 1:38:45.719
I've been shot,
but I ain't dying.

1:38:46.887 --> 1:38:49.789
Just make sure the damn doctor
don't cut my arm off.

1:38:50.561 --> 1:38:52.462
- Yeah, you have my word.

1:39:05.246 --> 1:39:07.147
Your husband's dead.

1:39:09.580 --> 1:39:12.581
He was obviously shot
by Tiberio's men.

1:39:16.356 --> 1:39:19.060
- You really think
the truth won't come out?

1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:21.689
- Who's to ask?

1:39:22.659 --> 1:39:24.197
Well, who is to tell?

1:39:28.434 --> 1:39:31.237
Oh, you need that looked after.

1:39:31.272 --> 1:39:33.206
It's gonna take a few stitches.

1:39:34.737 --> 1:39:37.441
- I'll wear my scar
as a badge of honor.

1:39:38.543 --> 1:39:40.444
- Mm-hmm.

1:39:43.185 --> 1:39:44.877
I need a drink.
