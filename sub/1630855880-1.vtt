WEBVTT

02:05.334 --> 02:06.460
It's really not fair.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.884
Look, the guy's training
for the Olympics, all right.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.261
He shouldn't be allowed to throw around

02:15.302 --> 02:17.137
his diving skills at parties.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.601
At least he could keep
his shirt on, geez.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.479
He should never have a shirt on.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.569
He has no idea who I am.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.822
How sad is that?

02:36.407 --> 02:38.242
Yeah, how sad is that?

02:57.511 --> 02:58.470
I don't understand what

02:58.512 --> 02:59.889
no, I don't understand
what you're asking me.

02:59.930 --> 03:00.806
You just gotta hold it.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.641
I'm holding it.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.309
You have to hold it.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.185
Oh man, you drained the keg.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.856
Uh yeah, gotta move faster out here.

03:08.898 --> 03:09.815
Holy shit, the cops.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.611
The future is so hard to predict.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.405
If I had a time machine,

03:16.447 --> 03:17.948
would it even make a
difference to try to go back

03:17.990 --> 03:19.825
and explain to my young
self what was ahead?

03:43.182 --> 03:45.392
Okay well, show me the other one.

03:46.352 --> 03:47.144
This one?

03:47.186 --> 03:48.979
Yes, definitely more affordable.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.231
Larger, but it's not
as like, all-inclusive.

03:51.273 --> 03:51.857
Right, right.

03:51.899 --> 03:52.691
So there'd be a lot more-

03:52.733 --> 03:54.693
Okay, whiskey sours up everybody.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.986
Thank you.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.363
Welcome.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.697
Bud Light Seltzer for the gentleman.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.908
Thank you for not
making me have to say it.

04:02.034 --> 04:02.701
Oh my God.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.869
Sorry.

04:03.911 --> 04:11.543
So I just wanna say, Sam, Emma,
we are so excited for you.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.797
Thank you for helping our daughter

04:14.838 --> 04:16.674
find a second chance at life.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.677
Welcome to our family, son.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.594
Thank you.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.013
The downstairs toilet is clogged.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.641
I had to put my arm all the way in.

04:25.683 --> 04:28.018
Hey Michael, wow.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.645
What, you're welcome.

04:29.687 --> 04:30.646
Thank you.

04:30.688 --> 04:31.563
Sure.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.984
Well, I also have some words
to share.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.570
I am so proud of the life
that you've made, Emma.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.947
And I know it hasn't been easy,

04:39.989 --> 04:42.074
and there are a lot of people

04:42.116 --> 04:46.537
who would've let that
stop them, but not you.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.539
And look, I know you and I,

04:48.580 --> 04:50.582
we drive each other nuts sometimes.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.544
No, what are you talking
about, drive each other nuts?

04:53.585 --> 04:54.461
Ladies.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.422
What I'm trying to say

04:56.463 --> 04:58.882
is that even though
you're my little sister,

04:58.924 --> 05:03.554
I hope to have as big a
heart as you do one day.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.806
Well said, honey.

05:07.474 --> 05:11.395
Well since we're all making speeches

05:11.437 --> 05:12.688
and making each other cry,

05:13.605 --> 05:15.607
I'd like to thank you Marie,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.443
for pushing me to learn an instrument

05:17.484 --> 05:19.445
because I didn't end up learning one,

05:19.486 --> 05:23.824
but I did run into an old
friend, my best friend.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.618
All right, we get it.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.454
You like your fiance.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.580
Nice for you.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.749
You are so lucky, you have me.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.043
Wow, wow.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.630
I guess that leaves me.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.426
I guess you all know that
I've been madly in love

05:42.468 --> 05:45.971
with Emma for a few
years now, give or take.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.347
It was eighth grade.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.807
Oh, wow Colin, thank you.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.519
Thank you, yeah, I didn't
realize we were keeping track.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.937
Well, I remember meeting
her for the first time

05:53.979 --> 05:56.857
and thinking, that's it, that's
the girl.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.360
And then life took us
in separate directions.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.571
And when we ran back into each other,

06:02.613 --> 06:05.657
we had both grown up quite
a bit, you could say.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.784
But some things don't change.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.745
And when I look at you now, Emma,

06:09.787 --> 06:12.164
it's like I'm right back
in the eighth grade again.

06:12.206 --> 06:16.001
And I'm thinking, that's
her, that's the girl.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.129
And I look at you all,
and I think that's it.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.672
That's the family.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.009
To family.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.677
To family.

06:26.970 --> 06:27.971
Cheer, cheer, cheers.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.016
I left my glass over there.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.397
Hi.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.732
Let's go home?

07:19.773 --> 07:20.566
What's going on?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.192
Yeah, gotta move fast around here.

Emma, come on.

My ride's gone and
your ride.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.578
Sam.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.955
So Sam, he's your boyfriend.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.957
He's my best friend.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.585
Ah, so he wants to be your boyfriend,

07:39.626 --> 07:41.712
but you're not into it, right?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.922
No, no, it's not like that.

07:43.964 --> 07:44.798
Sure.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.926
I mean, maybe it's a little
like that.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.927
A little like that?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.804
Shut up.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.934
I can't believe I failed my breathalyser.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.519
My parents are gonna kill me.

07:58.854 --> 07:59.938
That sucks.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.940
Do you ever feel like
everyone's always telling you

08:01.982 --> 08:02.983
who you are?

08:03.025 --> 08:03.984
All the time.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.946
My parents own the bookstore
in town, Blair Books.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.823
Yeah, I put that one together.

08:09.865 --> 08:10.741
Emma Blair.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.243
They think that me and my sister

08:13.285 --> 08:14.995
are going to take it over

08:15.037 --> 08:16.747
and they don't listen when I say

08:16.788 --> 08:19.124
that I never wanna do that.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.293
Marie wants that and that is
fine for her.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.962
She's always been the perfect
little bookseller's daughter.

08:24.004 --> 08:24.880
Right.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.758
But not me, I'm getting
out of here.

08:27.799 --> 08:28.884
Where are you gonna go?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.636
I'm gonna go see the world.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.054
I like that.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.306
You're not what I imagined
you'd be, you know?

08:34.348 --> 08:36.558
You imagined me?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.562
Well, my ex, she thought
you had a crush on me.

08:40.604 --> 08:41.813
She said she caught you
looking at me sometimes.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.648
No, that's not.

08:42.689 --> 08:46.193
That's- that's- that's

day, freshman year.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.948
There it is.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.575
No, but I obviously don't
have a thing for you now.

08:53.617 --> 08:54.451
Why don't you have a thing for
me now?

08:54.952 --> 08:56.161
Why don't you have a thing for
me now?

08:56.203 --> 09:01.541
I think I do actually, as of
about an hour and a half ago.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.294

09:04.336 --> 09:05.254

because of your shoot in Peru.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.750
Yeah, Acton for
Thanksgiving's a good idea.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.503
Yeah, we should probably
tell them the news in person.

Past six years been

beach down the street.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.150
It's a date.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.067
Okay.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.655
Do you know how long that is?

15:05.697 --> 15:06.656
Really long time.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.574
So long.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.432
Your husband
was on a helicopter

15:32.474 --> 15:34.476
that went down yesterday in the Pacific.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.395
We found the remains of both pilots,

15:37.437 --> 15:40.273
but we've not yet found your husband.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.274
And we do not believe

15:41.316 --> 15:43.443
he would've been able
to survive the crash.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.155
I'm so sorry.

15:48.156 --> 15:53.119
We're still searching,
let you know right away.

16:07.717 --> 16:12.514
Emma, it's your third day out here.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.558
I'm gonna stay out
here, as long as it takes.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.104
As long as what takes?

16:19.145 --> 16:23.274
He's lost and he's coming
back, and I'm gonna be here.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.526
You- you can't.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.530
I mean, that that won't work.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.281
I'm not giving up on him.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.991
Emma, give me the binoculars.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.118
No, Jesse's coming back.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.369
He was a long distance swimmer.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.413
He was the best in state, he can
do this.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.707
He's not coming back.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.333
You don't know that.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.463
Yeah Em, I do, it's been a week.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.132
They've given up the search.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.803
You just can't stand that
I'm no longer in your shadow.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.264
Well, I know my husband and
I know how incredible he is.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.100
And I'm not gonna let you
say he's anything less

16:57.142 --> 16:59.352
because you like it
better when I feel small.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.106
Emma.

17:03.148 --> 17:03.481
No.

17:03.523 --> 17:03.982
Emma.

17:04.023 --> 17:04.524
Don't console me.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.110
I'm so sorry, Emma.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.030
He's dead, I'm so sorry.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.286
No, he is not.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.122
No, he is not.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.331
Yeah.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.666
No, he is not.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.713
I'm sorry.

17:26.755 --> 17:29.674
No, he's not dead.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.675
I'm sorry.

17:32.635 --> 17:33.720
I'm so sorry.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.688
I don't know-

17:45.106 --> 17:47.108
I don't know how I can live
without him.

17:48.109 --> 17:48.777
I know.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.073
I know, but you will.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.284
How?

17:56.326 --> 17:58.787
You're gonna come home to Acton

17:58.828 --> 18:03.166
and you're gonna move in
with me and I'm gonna make

18:03.208 --> 18:05.710
your breakfast and your
lunches and your dinners

18:05.752 --> 18:09.672
and we're just gonna build you a
new life.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.093
But not right now.

18:15.762 --> 18:20.767
Now you get to just be broken
and I'll hold you together.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.188
I'll hold you together.

18:41.663 --> 18:46.125
Hey, walking down memory lane?

18:46.918 --> 18:49.462
Sorry, did I wake you?

18:49.504 --> 18:50.380
No, not at all.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.592
How are you feeling?

18:54.634 --> 18:55.635
I can't sleep.

18:57.762 --> 18:58.763
How are you feeling?

19:00.598 --> 19:01.474
I don't know.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.604
How about I run you a hot
shower?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.189
Give the old Sam Lee special.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.900
What's the Sam Lee special?

19:12.569 --> 19:14.654
Well, it's me turning on the shower.

20:20.261 --> 20:20.929
Oh, hey honey.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.682
Emma.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.517
I don't like that you're
understocking the classics.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.020
Obviously dad, but not now.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.397
I am not understocking the classics.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.273
You are overstocking the classics.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.816
Colin, focus.

20:33.858 --> 20:34.901
Sorry.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.237
We'll give you some space.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.453
So how are you, really?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.708
I don't know how I'm feeling.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.795
I mean, you're probably
feeling confused.

20:53.836 --> 20:54.879
I mean, yeah.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.298
I wasn't finished, you and Jesse,

20:57.340 --> 20:59.342
you had this beautiful life together

20:59.384 --> 21:02.512
and then he got on a
helicopter and it crashed.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.555
And we all thought he was dead.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.350
And you, you picked yourself up

21:07.392 --> 21:09.936
like this incredible person that
you are.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.730
And you found love again with a
great guy.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.606
Right-

21:13.648 --> 21:15.274
I'm still not finished.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.818
And now what is probably the
happiest day of your life

21:16.859 --> 21:20.780
is also the most complicated
and probably saddest day.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.700
Because no matter what
you do or how you feel,

21:23.741 --> 21:25.785
you're gonna break somebody's
heart.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.746
You've gained something
and you'll lose something.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.791
So it's okay to feel
happy and heartbroken.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.797
Oh, you can talk, I'm done.

21:37.839 --> 21:42.844
Oh, that was incredibly
verbose, but accurate.

21:43.678 --> 21:44.554
Thank you.

21:46.764 --> 21:49.726
Why did I spend my childhood
hating you?

21:49.767 --> 21:50.810
Because I hated you.

21:51.978 --> 21:52.895
Well, why did you hate me?

21:52.937 --> 21:54.981
Because you hated me.

21:55.023 --> 21:59.318
Oh my God, Emma, you
can't wear that to reunite

21:59.360 --> 22:01.320
with your long lost husband.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.826
Oh my God, amazing.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.789
The color, the color.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.792
Well, I think this works.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.336
I'm just not so sure about this.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.380
I'm engaged and I'm also married.

22:19.422 --> 22:20.882
I'm not sure what the protocol is.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.008
What does your gut tell you?

22:22.050 --> 22:23.342
To throw up, mostly.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.679
Oh yeah, you could wear that one.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.515
Yeah, or you could wear both.

22:29.557 --> 22:32.643
I just won't wear either.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.772
Okay, here we go.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.356
Oh, okay.

22:38.107 --> 22:38.983
Go get him.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.627
Hey Joe, Francine.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.087
Emma.

22:59.128 --> 23:02.048
Wow, you look different.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.973
Your boy's coming home, Frannie.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.019
Oh, we decided not to tell Jesse

23:15.061 --> 23:16.938
that you've already moved on.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.732
He's been through enough, don't
you think?

24:51.949 --> 24:53.951

25:03.669 --> 25:04.295
We're coming
to you live

25:04.337 --> 25:05.630
from the home of Jesse Lerner.

25:06.672 --> 25:11.177
God, can you imagine
your fiance has a husband,

25:11.219 --> 25:12.887
an alive husband.

25:12.929 --> 25:13.846
He was alive.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.057
You know she's gonna
go back to him, right?

25:16.098 --> 25:18.517
He came back from the dead.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.269
I mean, it doesn't get any
more romantic than that.

Morning.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.071
Hey buddy.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.781
Janice.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.824
Hi, we were just talking about you.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.535
Behind your back.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.582
Actually, that's my lunch.

25:41.624 --> 25:42.541
Guess now we're even.

25:46.629 --> 25:47.838
I swore if I ever made it back
to you,

25:47.880 --> 25:49.966
I'd just tell you how sorry I
was for leaving.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.095
I'm going to spend the rest of
our lives

25:54.136 --> 25:55.137
making it up to you.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.307
I'm engaged.

25:59.934 --> 26:00.810
What.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.605
I'm engaged to be married.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.275
You are married?

26:07.316 --> 26:09.694
No, to someone else.

26:18.703 --> 26:19.704
What?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.879
What, what is so funny?

26:28.921 --> 26:31.632
It's not, no, it's
just horrible.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.344
Yeah, it's terrible.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.347
You know, I think that's the
worst thing

26:38.389 --> 26:39.598
I've ever been told.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.690
Jesse, I didn't know that you
were-

26:47.732 --> 26:50.276
You thought I was dead. You
didn't know.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.238
There you are, you can't
just disappear like that.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.865
Come on, everybody's waiting
for you.

26:55.906 --> 26:56.782
Come on.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.123
It's too much.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.209
It's okay, just breathe.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm here.

27:11.422 --> 27:16.635
It's been a long time since
I've seen so many people.

27:19.347 --> 27:20.348
I should get going.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.977
Yeah, I'll stay here tonight

27:25.019 --> 27:27.313
'cause they really need me.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.733
But then I need to be with you.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.860
Can we go somewhere tomorrow?

27:32.902 --> 27:34.070
Of course.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.655
Let's go to Maine,
let's go to the cabin.

27:36.697 --> 27:37.740
Sure.

27:37.782 --> 27:38.657
First thing.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.285
Yeah, first thing.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.797
Hey, you're home.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.131
You're still making me a
grilled cheese

27:54.173 --> 27:55.925
with dairy-free cheddar?

27:55.966 --> 27:58.969
Yeah well, I figured just in
case you came back, you know,

27:59.929 --> 28:02.181
my little lactose intolerant.

28:02.223 --> 28:09.397
So how is he? still very,
very, very, very handsome.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.275
He seems good.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.070
I'm a little overwhelmed, but good.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.696
Good mostly.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.907
Good.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.868
Good that he seems good.

28:26.956 --> 28:31.961
I saw you kissing him on the news.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.799
I'm not upset about it.

28:36.841 --> 28:41.846
I just... not telling
you felt wrong somehow.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.056
So I just wanted you to know.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.351
I'm really sorry, Sam.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.186
This has all been so-

28:49.228 --> 28:51.397
Confusing, it's confusing.

28:56.277 --> 28:59.113
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.490
It's gonna be okay.

29:02.283 --> 29:03.159
Okay.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.829
I love you so much, Sam.

29:06.871 --> 29:07.872
I love you.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.023
I need you.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.828
Are you sure?

29:48.621 --> 29:49.455
Yeah.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.149
Where's your ring?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.500
You are gonna have to choose,
you know.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.174
I mean, he's your husband.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.933
I think we should call off the wedding.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.979
What?

30:55.020 --> 30:56.021
I mean, can you honestly say

30:56.063 --> 30:58.190
that no matter what
happens from this moment on

30:58.232 --> 30:59.942
that you're ready to spend

30:59.984 --> 31:01.360
the rest of your life with me?

31:12.496 --> 31:16.875
If we're gonna have a
future, you gotta go.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.088
You gotta go and do
whatever you need to do

31:21.130 --> 31:22.131
in order to know.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.259
I could stay at a hotel

31:25.301 --> 31:27.469
or you could stay at Marie
or your parent's, but-

31:27.511 --> 31:29.096
No, I get it.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.325
Yeah, I'd be happy to.

33:15.536 --> 33:18.997
Do you think you can be in love

33:19.039 --> 33:21.291
with two people at the same
time?

33:23.168 --> 33:24.545
Maybe some people can.

33:24.586 --> 33:28.507
I don't even think
that's the point though.

33:28.549 --> 33:32.636
You're a different person with
Sam than you were with Jesse.

33:32.678 --> 33:36.473
And maybe it's not
about who you love more.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.517
Maybe it's about whether
you wanna be the person

33:38.559 --> 33:41.019
you could be with Jesse

33:41.061 --> 33:44.106
or the person that
you're becoming with Sam.

33:45.149 --> 33:48.026
Wow, you're good lately.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.111
I just know you.

34:55.511 --> 34:56.470
You look great.

34:59.348 --> 35:00.224
You do.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.644
Oh, you gotta drive the whole way.

35:03.685 --> 35:06.605
My license expired when they
issued my death certificate.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.232
Okay.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.358
Good times.

36:14.923 --> 36:17.259
Hey, do you mind if
we stop by the store?

36:17.301 --> 36:19.469
I guess I left some stuff
at Marie's last night.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.806
Sure. Your stuff isn't at
your place?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.683
No, I'm not currently at my place.

36:25.684 --> 36:26.643
Okay.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.563
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone.

36:29.605 --> 36:31.315
Your parents still
recommending Walden Pond?

36:31.356 --> 36:32.691
To anyone who walks in
and then going,

36:32.733 --> 36:34.943
"You know, Walden Pond is just
down the road."

36:36.320 --> 36:37.946
Well, my parents are retired now.

36:37.988 --> 36:40.490
Really? Good for them.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.993
So Marie's finally inherited her
birthright?

36:43.035 --> 36:45.871
The bookseller's daughter
has become the book seller.

36:45.913 --> 36:48.999
Actually, I run it.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.417
Oh yeah, you run it.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.419
No, I'm serious, I run the bookstore.

36:53.712 --> 36:54.671
Oh.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.592
I know, I used to
hate it, but I lost you

36:58.634 --> 37:03.639
and I had nothing, so I moved
back home and there it was.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.892
Em.

37:06.934 --> 37:07.809
What?

37:09.728 --> 37:10.687
Come on, let's go.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.326
You are a sight for sore eyes.

37:24.368 --> 37:27.454
We are so happy you're okay, Jesse.

37:27.496 --> 37:28.997
Yeah, I missed you guys too.

37:29.039 --> 37:29.915
Hi.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.795
God, a real life
Odysseus is back to Ithaka.

37:34.836 --> 37:37.464
It's good to see
you're still reading, sis.

37:37.506 --> 37:38.507
Hi Sophie.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.390
You're hungry?

37:46.431 --> 37:49.309
Wait a minute, I want you to
meet someone.

37:51.103 --> 37:54.398
Jesse, this is my daughter Sophie.

37:54.439 --> 37:57.526
Sophie, this is Jesse.

37:58.819 --> 37:59.903
Hey.

38:00.946 --> 38:01.863
Okay, hey.

38:03.073 --> 38:04.074
Welcome back.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.117
Thank you, good to see you.

38:05.158 --> 38:09.454
I guess a lot's happened
since you've been gone.

38:09.496 --> 38:10.706
She is adorable.

38:11.665 --> 38:12.541
Congratulations.

38:12.582 --> 38:13.458
Thank you.

38:14.334 --> 38:15.085
Say hi to Mike for me.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.962
You can tell him yourself, hey.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.506
How you been?

38:20.590 --> 38:22.300
Stranded on a desert island, man.

38:22.342 --> 38:23.010
Oh right.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.596
Must have been nice to get away.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.348
For a bit, yeah.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.851
We should hit the road.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.477
Yeah.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.063
We're gonna head to the
cabin, just for a couple days.

38:35.105 --> 38:37.441
Thank you.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.318
Yeah.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.489
Actually, can I drive?

38:44.531 --> 38:45.615
Without a license?

38:45.657 --> 38:47.534
Well, it's a technicality.

38:49.036 --> 38:50.078
Come on, it'd be fun.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.330
Okay.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.040
Thank you.

38:57.002 --> 38:57.836
Morning.

38:57.878 --> 38:58.712
Good morning.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.380
Morning, Mr. Lee.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.924
Liz, you are a trumpet player,
please spit out your gum.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.968
Rest of you, let's jump right in.

39:05.010 --> 39:10.015
So Debussy is considered our
first impressionist composer.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.937
Impressionist, can anybody
tell me what that means. Zoe?

39:15.979 --> 39:18.148
It doesn't have a melody or something.

39:18.190 --> 39:18.982
Right, right.

39:19.024 --> 39:22.152
Debussy was less concerned about
a melody

39:22.194 --> 39:27.365
and more about evoking
a mood and an emotion.

39:31.661 --> 39:33.663
He used notes like a paintbrush,

39:33.705 --> 39:36.041
painting colors that
conveyed an impression.

39:39.628 --> 39:43.840
So what moods are being
conveyed right now?

39:43.882 --> 39:45.509
Go ahead, shout them out.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.676
Sadness.

39:46.718 --> 39:47.594
Loneliness.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.388
Fear you might lose Emma forever.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.391
Really, really, Zoe?

39:53.433 --> 39:55.435
You got that from the song?

39:55.477 --> 39:57.437
No, I got that from how
you were playing the song.

39:57.479 --> 39:58.814
I mean, are we really not
gonna talk

39:58.855 --> 40:00.565
about your husband in-law?

40:00.607 --> 40:01.525
My what?

40:01.566 --> 40:02.359
The guy that's married
to your wife, man.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.028
Your brother- husband, or whatever.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.072
Marcus, he's not my
brother- husband.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.740
Oh you know, my cousin
is in a closed quad

40:08.782 --> 40:09.699
and it really works for them.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.868
So I don't see why a triple
can't work.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.538
Okay, first of all, Dylan,
it's called a throuple and-

40:14.579 --> 40:17.040
Okay, we're not having this conversation.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.834
All right, let's go, instruments up.

40:18.875 --> 40:19.543
Oh, whoa, whoa.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.545
Hey, Clair de Lune, come on.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.422
I'm trying to get palm reading.

40:24.464 --> 40:25.841
No, no, no, no, no.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.802
Okay, the most romantic
place we ever went to.

40:28.844 --> 40:29.719
Ooh.

40:30.512 --> 40:35.642
I know I'm supposed to say Paris.

40:35.684 --> 40:39.062
But it's
Amsterdam.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.063
Yeah.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.148
New Year's Eve.

40:41.189 --> 40:45.861
We fought about that stupid
bike lock until 11:59.

40:45.902 --> 40:46.778
Yeah.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.447
And then the clock turned
and you said,

40:49.489 --> 40:50.407
"Well, I don't care who lost it.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.617
I just wanna spend my whole year
with you."

40:53.577 --> 40:54.953
And then you kissed me

40:54.995 --> 40:59.916
and then felt like nothing
mattered except us.

41:01.501 --> 41:02.294
And you're right.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.047
You did lose that lock, by the way.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.842
No, you lost the lock by the river.

41:08.884 --> 41:09.759
No, no.

41:10.677 --> 41:11.595
I've had a lot of time to think
about this

41:11.636 --> 41:14.723
and I have decided I
remember you losing it.

41:14.764 --> 41:15.807
Okay.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.225
Agree to disagree.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.143
Okay.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.833
Hey, come on.

41:43.001 --> 41:43.835
Our cabin awaits.

41:58.767 --> 42:00.518
Oh, come on.

42:03.855 --> 42:07.025
Tuba. Come on, tuba, get it together.

42:07.067 --> 42:07.984
I thought I did pretty good.

42:08.026 --> 42:11.238
You are Marcus, yeah,
you are, you're great.

42:11.279 --> 42:15.825
You're.

42:15.867 --> 42:16.868
Great.

42:24.751 --> 42:25.794
We haven't been here since-

42:25.835 --> 42:26.711
Our wedding.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.881
Right, that whole thing.

42:39.683 --> 42:40.809
Do you want a drink?

42:40.850 --> 42:41.643
Please.

42:41.685 --> 42:42.435
Okay, great.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.145
Let's see what we can find here.

42:54.406 --> 42:56.116
So you can build a fire now?

42:57.284 --> 42:58.702
So you get tattoos now.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.834
I guess a lot has changed.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.085
Some things, yeah, sure.

43:08.712 --> 43:11.715
But nothing that really matters.
To us.

43:14.926 --> 43:15.760
Finally.

43:17.387 --> 43:18.263
Finally.

43:29.774 --> 43:35.864
Smooth.

43:38.158 --> 43:39.701
What does it say?

43:41.077 --> 43:41.953
Oh.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.001
"And so I walked on."

44:03.433 --> 44:05.643
I'll never leave your side again.

44:11.775 --> 44:18.782
All I ever wanted was, one
more day to be with you.

44:32.462 --> 44:36.966
I missed your face, I missed
your face, I missed your-

44:39.469 --> 44:41.721
I missed the feel of you.

47:10.078 --> 47:10.954
Jesse.

47:17.293 --> 47:22.298
Just turns on when you need
it, off when you don't.

47:24.926 --> 47:25.593
Yeah.

47:27.262 --> 47:28.429
Faucets are wild, huh?

47:31.182 --> 47:32.392
What happened out there?

47:39.440 --> 47:41.401
Nah, I just wanna focus on us
right now.

47:43.403 --> 47:45.446
I'll tell you what I do need.

47:45.488 --> 47:49.909
I mean, what I really, really need.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.080
Breakfast.

47:55.123 --> 47:57.417
Oh, you're such a jerk.

47:57.458 --> 47:58.293
You know that?

47:58.334 --> 47:59.210
Yeah.

48:01.087 --> 48:02.547
Mr. Lee, just a couple questions.

48:02.589 --> 48:03.506
Oh shit.

48:03.548 --> 48:06.092
Mr. Lee, is the wedding off?

48:06.134 --> 48:07.594
Is- is Emma here, is she here?

48:07.635 --> 48:09.470
Can we just get a little
privacy please?

48:09.512 --> 48:11.180
"We", does that mean you're
still getting married?

48:11.222 --> 48:12.432
No. I- I-

48:12.473 --> 48:13.391
It's off?

48:13.433 --> 48:14.976
I honestly don't know.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.644
Are you afraid that your
fiance's gonna leave you

48:16.686 --> 48:18.021
and go back to her husband?

48:18.062 --> 48:20.106
Sam, have you talked to Jesse
yet?

48:20.148 --> 48:22.400
Can you give us any
details about the wedding?

48:27.697 --> 48:28.656
Feel a little bad

48:28.698 --> 48:30.241
you had to move back to
New England, it's cold.

48:30.283 --> 48:32.285
You don't have to feel bad.

48:32.327 --> 48:34.954
I'm just glad that neither
of us is stuck anymore

48:34.996 --> 48:38.708
and we can start living
again, go travelling.

48:38.750 --> 48:42.170
Travelling, you don't
wanna settle somewhere safe.

48:42.211 --> 48:43.129
We have home base.

48:43.171 --> 48:47.050
Sure, but now I was thinking
Venice Beach,

48:47.091 --> 48:48.718
anywhere in California would be good.

48:48.760 --> 48:49.719
I mean, was the best time of our lives.

48:49.761 --> 48:52.055
Mexican food was top notch.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.307
And you can work from
anywhere, right?

48:54.349 --> 48:56.392
Travel, writting, riding could
be wherever we want.

48:56.434 --> 49:00.355
Well, I haven't written
a travel piece in years.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.106
Really?

49:03.149 --> 49:05.568
I know you do the store, but I
just assumed

49:05.610 --> 49:10.198
you were still doing
what you wanted it to do.

49:10.239 --> 49:12.533
The store, it is what I wanna do.

49:12.575 --> 49:15.995
You know, I like seeing the regulars,

49:16.037 --> 49:18.414
getting a crack at the new releases.

49:18.456 --> 49:19.332
This coming from the girl

49:19.374 --> 49:20.583
that wouldn't read the "Hunger
Games?"

49:20.625 --> 49:23.211
Well, turns out the "Hunger
Games" is actually pretty great.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.505
Hey, how you doing?

49:25.546 --> 49:28.091
Could we please have two bacon,

49:28.132 --> 49:30.176
egg and cheese biscuits
with home fries, please?

49:30.218 --> 49:32.553
Actually, I don't eat cheese anymore.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.138
It's like a whole thing.

49:34.180 --> 49:35.098
Okay.

49:35.139 --> 49:36.516
One egg and cheese biscuit with
home fries

49:36.557 --> 49:38.101
and my beautiful wife-

49:38.142 --> 49:40.019
Fried egg on toast.

49:41.145 --> 49:43.064
Fried egg on toast.

49:44.190 --> 49:45.066
Yes.

49:46.192 --> 49:49.362
Emerson and Alcott and
Thoreau were all from Concord.

49:50.488 --> 49:53.658
I had a lot of time to do
reading while you were gone.

49:54.659 --> 49:57.662
A lot of existential dread, you
might say.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.165
But you know what? Thoreau,
he knows what's up.

50:01.207 --> 50:02.750
And Walden Pond-

50:02.792 --> 50:04.627
Is just down the road.

50:05.545 --> 50:07.130
Yes, yes.

50:07.171 --> 50:10.007
Oh, and when the leaves change
in autumn.

50:12.719 --> 50:16.514
When you died, when I
thought you were dead,

50:17.682 --> 50:22.061
I had nothing and came back here.

50:23.104 --> 50:24.313
My parents and Marie,

50:25.231 --> 50:28.025
they basically nursed me back to life.

50:28.067 --> 50:31.446
They picked out all these
books to distract me.

50:31.487 --> 50:34.615
And that's when I read
"Hunger Games", by the way.

50:34.657 --> 50:41.622
And "Wild" and "Octavia
Butler" and "Joan Didion".

50:41.664 --> 50:45.168
And that's when I realized
that I wasn't alone.

50:48.379 --> 50:52.049
All these people that had, come
before me

50:52.091 --> 50:57.054
they, they felt this pain that I
felt and they found way through

50:57.096 --> 51:00.308
and, I could too.

51:03.728 --> 51:08.399
Then this place, this
place put me back together.

51:14.405 --> 51:17.533
You and I, we had this idea

51:17.575 --> 51:21.496
that our adventures
had to be grand, right?

51:21.537 --> 51:23.539
That we had to go to
Madrid and the Great Wall

51:23.581 --> 51:26.834
and go everywhere extraordinary.

51:26.876 --> 51:31.088
But extraordinary's everywhere.

51:32.715 --> 51:35.510
Running a bookstore and
being with our families

51:35.551 --> 51:39.096
and raising our kids here,
that's a great adventure.

51:45.561 --> 51:46.437
Kids?

51:49.440 --> 51:51.359
I wasn't sure you ever wanted to
have any.

51:53.402 --> 51:54.487
I wasn't sure either.

51:57.657 --> 51:58.533
But I am now.

51:59.450 --> 52:03.788
I could build a family here,
it's home.

52:08.793 --> 52:12.463
Well, I am very thankful to
this place

52:12.505 --> 52:14.215
for keeping such good care of you

52:15.550 --> 52:16.425
while I was gone.

52:30.648 --> 52:31.482
Sorry I'm late.

52:32.441 --> 52:33.317
It's all good.

52:35.319 --> 52:36.904
All right, everybody. Phones away.

52:38.239 --> 52:39.657
Seriously Debbie Sue, let's go.

52:41.826 --> 52:44.328
Put away the God damn phones!

52:47.665 --> 52:50.835
Sorry, that was excessive.

52:52.420 --> 52:54.547
I'm going through a real
stressful time right now.

52:54.589 --> 52:59.594
And wait, Penny, Tom, please
explain why you're in my class.

53:00.428 --> 53:02.221
We all wanna be here for you.

53:02.263 --> 53:04.390
In case you explode, we
wanted to watch it happen.

53:04.432 --> 53:08.269
And if you do explode, then
we wanna be there for you.

53:08.311 --> 53:09.478
Well, thank you.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.272
But I'm fine and you're not in orchestra,

53:11.314 --> 53:13.316
so please get out of my class.

53:13.357 --> 53:14.817
The rest of you, instruments up.

53:22.658 --> 53:23.868
Actually, can somebody please
tell me

53:23.910 --> 53:25.912
what the hell it means when someone

53:25.953 --> 53:28.706
is texting you for 18 hours

53:28.748 --> 53:30.416
and doesn't hit send?

53:30.458 --> 53:32.793
I mean, what the crap are these
dots?

53:32.835 --> 53:34.211
Is she texting me?

53:34.253 --> 53:35.588
Is she not texting me, is it
good news?

53:35.630 --> 53:36.589
Is it not good news?

53:36.631 --> 53:37.798
If I want it to be good news,

53:37.840 --> 53:40.259
does that make me a bad person?

53:40.301 --> 53:41.677
Is it selfish?

53:41.719 --> 53:45.514
Is it selfish to want
my fiance to be my wife?

53:45.556 --> 53:47.350
I mean, apparently it is.

53:47.391 --> 53:50.478
Well, I'm sorry that I
didn't survive a plane crash

53:50.519 --> 53:53.814
and spend four years on
some small island somewhere.

53:53.856 --> 53:55.983
I guess that makes me an asshole somehow.

53:58.778 --> 54:00.821
Of all the people in the world,

54:00.863 --> 54:02.782
why did it have to be him?

54:02.823 --> 54:04.951
Why is it always him?

54:07.954 --> 54:12.917
I met her first, I loved
her first, finders keepers.

54:14.627 --> 54:16.879
Not that she's some soccer
ball in the playground.

54:16.921 --> 54:18.798
Obviously she can
make her own decisions,

54:18.839 --> 54:20.967
as can all of the bright,

54:21.008 --> 54:23.552
capable young women
in this class.

54:23.594 --> 54:27.014
But I do think that finders
keepers applies here.

54:27.056 --> 54:28.349
No, no, I don't.

54:28.391 --> 54:29.183
No, I don't.

54:29.225 --> 54:30.476
That, that's the patriarchy talking

54:30.518 --> 54:33.479
and we must all fight it together.

54:45.741 --> 54:48.869
I just want her to love me
more than she loves him.

54:53.499 --> 54:56.335
Well, that was wildly inappropriate.

54:57.795 --> 54:58.796
I'm gonna stop.

54:58.838 --> 55:00.715
No man, for God's
sakes, just keep talking.

55:10.099 --> 55:12.101
Maybe we should go a bit slower.

55:12.143 --> 55:13.102
Really?

55:13.144 --> 55:14.603
Yeah.

55:14.645 --> 55:15.938
Come on, it's a little fun, right?

55:18.733 --> 55:19.692
This is not good.

55:20.860 --> 55:22.361
We'll be fine, it's okay.

55:22.403 --> 55:23.612
You don't have your license.

55:23.654 --> 55:25.489
It'll be good, it'll be good.

55:25.531 --> 55:26.282
I told you earlier,

55:26.323 --> 55:27.908
I said you don't have your license.

55:27.950 --> 55:33.456
Hello Officer, how can I help
you?

55:33.497 --> 55:36.667
You were speeding.
License and registration.

55:36.709 --> 55:38.419
That was an honest mistake, truly.

55:38.461 --> 55:39.837
And I'm very sorry.

55:39.879 --> 55:42.631
Maybe we could get off with the
warning?

55:42.673 --> 55:44.675
License and registration.

55:44.717 --> 55:45.801
I technically don't have it.

55:45.843 --> 55:49.764
He's been lost at sea,
maybe you've heard about it.

55:49.805 --> 55:51.849
It's been all over the news.

55:51.891 --> 55:53.768
If I could reach back,

55:53.809 --> 55:55.770
I can grab an article to show you.

56:03.903 --> 56:04.779
Here.

56:09.533 --> 56:10.868
This doesn't explain why
you're driving,

56:10.910 --> 56:12.661
let alone speeding.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.997
Oh, he just wanted everything

56:15.039 --> 56:18.375
to feel normal for once.
We both do.

56:20.878 --> 56:21.796
You have a license ma'am?

56:21.837 --> 56:23.422
Me? yes, yes I do.

56:38.479 --> 56:42.399
Okay, Ms. Blair, looks
like you're driving now.

57:13.139 --> 57:15.808
Please try to keep
it under 55, all right?

57:15.850 --> 57:16.725
Welcome home.

57:17.601 --> 57:18.602
Thank you.

57:24.024 --> 57:26.819
You changed your name back.

57:26.861 --> 57:29.905
I thought you were dead.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.866
So you went to the
social security office

57:31.907 --> 57:34.577
and changed your name back?

57:34.618 --> 57:37.121
There's more to it than that.

57:38.581 --> 57:39.456
Okay.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.210
She should be with the
person that she loves the most.

57:43.252 --> 57:46.547
Not necessarily the person
that loves her the most,

57:47.631 --> 57:50.551
because I love the most,
I love her the most.

57:51.927 --> 57:53.762
I know that everyone thinks
that he must love her the most

57:53.804 --> 57:55.598
because he survived the
desert island for her.

57:55.639 --> 57:58.225
But I comforted her while
he was on that island.

57:59.935 --> 58:04.064
You know, I sat with her
while she cried for him.

58:04.106 --> 58:08.903
And I figured out a way to love
someone with my whole heart,

58:08.944 --> 58:11.488
knowing that a part of
her would always love him.

58:13.532 --> 58:15.117
And I did that for her.

58:17.745 --> 58:19.663
Well, you should probably get
outta here.

58:19.705 --> 58:23.042
Oh yeah, like American Lit can
hold a candle to this drama.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.961
It's inappropriate to keep
you from your classes, Dylan.

58:27.129 --> 58:27.963
On the other hand,

58:28.005 --> 58:30.549
there's still a lot to
discuss here.

58:32.176 --> 58:33.177
All right, hit me.

58:40.809 --> 58:43.187
Honestly, you know what the
weirdest part about all this is?

58:45.022 --> 58:47.691
Everyone thinks they're the
hero of their own story.

58:48.275 --> 58:51.946
Everyone. maybe I'm not the hero.

58:56.367 --> 58:57.660
Maybe I'm the bad guy.

59:15.010 --> 59:16.637
Jesse, please.

59:17.596 --> 59:19.556
Jesse, talk to me, please.

59:20.724 --> 59:24.186
I was supposed to come home
to my wife who waited for me.

59:24.228 --> 59:25.688
Jesse, I did wait.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.231
You got engaged to someone else.

59:27.273 --> 59:29.066
Because I thought you were dead.

59:29.108 --> 59:30.025
So you replaced me.

59:30.067 --> 59:32.778
No, I didn't replace you, I
loved you.

59:32.820 --> 59:34.196
I still love you.

59:34.238 --> 59:35.739
This fiance, you love him too?

59:39.827 --> 59:41.829
Do you love him or not!?

59:42.955 --> 59:47.918
Yes, yes I love him.

59:51.714 --> 59:53.048
Do you love him more than me?

59:53.090 --> 59:54.341
Is he better than me?

59:54.383 --> 59:56.176
Jesse, no, it's not like that.

59:56.218 --> 59:58.053
Sam and I-

59:58.095 --> 59:59.054
So he's got a name.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.055
His name's Sam.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:09.982
Sam Lee.

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:15.821
I bet this was a dream come true
for him.

01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:16.655
That is not fair.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.615
You have no idea what I went through.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:19.658
You went through.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:24.621
I was on a dead rock
for four years, alone.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:28.292
Starving and just trying not to die.

01:00:29.877 --> 01:00:33.881
That whole time you know
what I thought about? This.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:38.344
You. I just thought about us.

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:42.389
Right now was supposed
to be the good time.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.643
I was supposed to come home
to a life I was missing.

01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:54.276
My part was to get back to
you and your part was to wait.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:01:00.783
I did my part Emma, what did you
do?

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.368
I had to live my life.

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:07.414
I had to learn how to live
without you.

01:01:11.794 --> 01:01:13.003
You managed to do that.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:19.134
Jesse.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.470
You know, they say if you love someone,

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.472
you should set them free.

01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:27.101
I'm starting to realize
that if you love someone,

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.436
you don't let anything stand in
your way.

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:31.271
You shout it from the mountaintops.

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.148
You race through traffic.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.735
You survived being
marooned on a desert island

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:39.029
and swim for miles just
to get back to them.

01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:40.906
Son of a bitch, I'm screwed.

01:02:47.139 --> 01:02:48.182
Dear Jesse.

01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:51.894
You've been gone more
than three years now,

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:55.772
but there hasn't been a day
when I haven't thought of you.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.359
At first, I refused to
admit you were gone.

01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:03.947
I couldn't sleep, I couldn't
eat.

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.411
Even after the search was called off

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.998
and they said you were dead,
it was so hard to let go.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:17.085
Hey, you've
tried to call Jesse Lerner.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.837
I obviously have better things
to do,

01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:21.298
so leave a message and I'll call
you back.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.257
I felt pain

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.384
that I didn't think was humanly possible.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.805
At times, it nearly broke me.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:34.603
Hey, came across this at the store.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:37.940
It's by Joan Didion about
the death of her husband.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.441
I hate being given books.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:43.028
I know, just a shot in the dark.

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.071
Just in case you wanted to read

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.822
how someone else got through it.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.289
I mean, at least give me a
happy book.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.416
I don't wanna read about people dying.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.544
Okay, I can work with that.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.629
How about "Pride and Prejudice"?

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:02.047
Or falling in love.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.384
Okay, wow.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.846
So no death or love.

01:04:10.556 --> 01:04:11.515
I'll make a list.

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:14.560
There's gotta be like
three books in existence

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.520
that don't deal with either.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:22.192
I used to
think grief was chronic.

01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:24.319
Just a never ending cycle of bad days

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.405
with the occasional good day.

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.865
No D or L, this one's
conquered.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:35.497
♪ Makes you tethered, tethered ♪

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:40.043
♪ Trust when you fall
and every risk you take ♪

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:44.172
♪ Knowing redemption's always on
its way ♪

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:48.176
♪ Let all the courage start to
wake ♪

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.930
♪ Unafraid, unafraid ♪

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:57.144
♪ Unafraid, unafraid ♪

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.103
♪ Unafraid, unafraid ♪

01:04:58.145 --> 01:05:01.898
You were right, I loved
it. what else you got?

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.444
That can had love or
death in them, tons.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:07.529
But then I started to think

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.489
that maybe the good days

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:11.617
could be good weeks or good months.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:17.372
♪ Look for better measure,
measure ♪

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:18.040
Oh, just say it.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.584
My baby's finally a bookworm.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.546
Doesn't mean that I
wanna let go of the memories

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:27.049
of you or the love I have for you,

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.552
but it does mean that I'm
ready to let go of the sadness.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.141
I will carry you with me always,

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:40.395
but I cannot define myself
by the loss anymore.

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.605
And that's four.

01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:43.565
But you already know that
'cause you're super good at it.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.651
So let me just play it you just
for fun.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:54.117
Emma?

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:55.535
Sam?

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.120
Here.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.163
Hi.

01:05:58.205 --> 01:05:59.581
Here, let me help you with that.

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.669
Oh my God. It still works.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:04.169
Sorry.

01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:05.712
You're good.

01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:06.755
Yeah, you don't have to buy it.

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.590
Oh my God. Hi.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:09.883
Hi.

01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:10.759
How are you?

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:11.593
I'm good.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:12.469
Have you been...?

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:13.970
Can't believe-

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:15.013
I mean-

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:17.099
Yeah, you look, yeah wow.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:17.766
Emma Blair.

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:19.434
Wow, can't believe it.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:39.204
Keep reading.

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:44.084
I'm going out into the world
with an open heart now,

01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:47.003
and I'm going to go where life
takes me.

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.256
So you wanna learn an
instrument?

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:52.134
Yeah, we can't all play
every single one of them yet.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.009
Hey, I will have you know,

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.137
I'm actually pretty bad at the harp.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.179
Oh okay.

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:58.807
No, that's a lie, I'm
pretty good, I'm always-

01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:01.226
Well, I thought I'd start
with something easy like piano.

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:03.562
Oh, well, if you want my advice.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.314
Yes, your advice is the
exact advice I would like.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:07.566
You should definitely go for
this one.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.067
It's 88 keys.

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:11.153
It's weighted, it's perfect to
learn on.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.320
Great, I'll take it.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:13.572
Great.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:14.740
You're a good salesman.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.284
Do you ring me up here or up
there, or?

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.412
Oh, no, no, no, I don't work here.

01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:21.288
Oh my God.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.248
Yeah, I came for a pedal

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.083
and I've just been looking for
an excuse

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:27.043
to keep talking to you, so.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.048
Jesse's dead.

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:33.049
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:37.512
I heard, I'm so sorry,
I should have called.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:39.222
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:41.266
When I started dating him,

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:44.394
I guess I stopped being a good
friend to you, so it's okay.

01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:45.312
It's on me.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:49.274
So what do you do then
when you're not pretending?

01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:51.568
I teach Orchestra at AB.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.404
Wow, that's crazy.

01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:55.530
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:08:00.076
I'm back at Acton running the store.

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:01.703
Blair Books.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:02.746
Yeah.

01:08:02.788 --> 01:08:04.623
You used to hate it there.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:05.791
People change, I guess.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.167
Yeah, thank God for that.

01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:09.211
Yeah, I agree, thank God.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.880
Well, I'll have to drop by sometime.

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:13.507
Say hi.

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.550
I'd like that, that would be nice.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.844
I'm happy to say I've reached a place

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:19.638
where your memory brings me joy.

01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:23.558
I have found meaning in life
that I never would've guessed.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.730
Wow.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:29.564
See, the funny thing about this

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.692
is that you do actually work here.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.486
Well, I'm so glad you stopped by

01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:38.365
because I've actually become
quite good at the piano.

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:39.074
Really?

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.867
Yes, you'd be very impressed.

01:08:40.909 --> 01:08:44.746
I know "Chopsticks" and "Heart
and Soul".

01:08:44.788 --> 01:08:46.832
It's like the core of
western music right there.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.544
Very good. Well, show me what
you got.

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:51.586
Well, I don't have a piano.

01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:54.422
Sure you do. Anything
you can play on the piano

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.341
you can play on the counter.

01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:57.467
It's an old music
teacher's trick.

01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:59.678
Here, gimme a song.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.556
Beethoven.

01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:05.934
Okay, that's less of a
song and more of a person.

01:09:05.976 --> 01:09:07.853
But I think we can work with that.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.771
Ready?

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.815
Yeah.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.362
Oh, I know this one.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.741
You wanna take this one?

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:23.451
There you go.

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:44.931
What is your sister doing?

01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:46.641
That's more.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:47.976
Living.

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.979
Oh, so that's what that looks like.

01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:51.855
There, it's good.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.321
So I should probably buy a book

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.656
so it doesn't seem like I came
in here

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:02.407
just to talk to you.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:04.910
This one.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.830
On the house.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:09.706
Yeah?

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:12.500
Yeah, or you can just, you can
owe me.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.545
Or how about I take
you to lunch sometime?

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:17.672
Lunch?

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.341
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:22.385
I was thinking sometime
between breakfast and dinner.

01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:25.221
Lunch sounds nice.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.307
Great.

01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:28.224
Okay.

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:39.611
Tell me everything.

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:43.323
I think if I work hard,
I can have the sort of life

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:45.033
that you would've wanted for me.

01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:46.576
I can't go on a date, right?

01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:48.954
Like, that's crazy.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:52.832
I can call him next year
maybe if he's still single.

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:54.751
Well, shutting yourself
off from the world

01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:57.712
doesn't prove how much
you loved your husband.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.590
You have your whole life ahead
of you. You should live it.

01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:09.307
I believe I can have a happy future

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:12.268
where I love and am loved in return.

01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:30.578
So we've been dating six months now.

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:33.790
Yeah.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:39.379
One of the months was
February, so it's light six.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:42.590
Come on.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.969
Well, long or short,

01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:51.391
I think I'm in love with you,

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.441
but I don't think I'm ready to
say it.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:00.525
Or hear myself say it.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:08.491
Well.

01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:13.663
Don't tell anyone I told you,

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.708
but I think I'm in love with you too.

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:21.504
I always have been.

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:48.990
I don't know, it all kind
of sounds the same to me.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.409
I'm not gonna lie, but
I know that you love it.

01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:52.118
So I appreciate it.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.078
Thank you.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.580
Hey, you wanna go this way?

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:57.957
Let's go for a walk.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:00.794
I'm sorry, we're gonna go down
some steps.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:01.669
What?

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:02.754
Yep.

01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:03.421
And you're gonna keep your eyes closed

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:04.672
because you trust me, right?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.007
I do, I trust you.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:06.841
Okay, one foot, here we go.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.635
That's perfect, you're doing great.

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:11.930
I'm sorry, are we going
onto the green line?

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:13.807
We are not going onto the
green line.

01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:15.767
It kind of feels like you're
taking me onto the green line.

01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:16.643
It's not true.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:17.685
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.146
The lighting here is much
better, I promise you.

01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:22.524
Okay, so here's the thing.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.858
Yep.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.193
All right.

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.027
Where am I going?

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:28.696
You're here, I got you.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:30.740
So here's the thing.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.619
I bought something a few weeks ago,

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:39.082
and I haven't been able to
decide when to give it to you.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.877
I was doing some thinking and I realized

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:46.464
that it should probably
be you that decides.

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.092
Okay.

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.603
Oh my gosh.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:03.898
Your students.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.734
We have been working on
this for a few months now.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:10.822
I'd call it your song, on
account of it being yours,

01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:13.116
but Elton John kind of
beat me to the punch.

01:14:13.158 --> 01:14:17.036
So it's currently untitled.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.581
Guys, actually, can we cut the
music?

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.749
Sorry, the sound is
really traveling in here.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.459
Sorry Mr. Lee.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.460
No, it's fine.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:26.504
Hey.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:27.797
Hi.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:36.598
Emma, I was put on this earth
to be yours, and I am so,

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.808
so lucky to be able to call you mine.

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:44.606
I believe in us, I believe
we're good for each other.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:48.026
And I believe that I'm a
better man because of you.

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:53.740
Here it is.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.659
And I don't want you to do anything

01:14:56.701 --> 01:15:01.706
except hold on to it
and just keep it safe.

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:08.504
And when you're ready, if you're
ever ready, I'll be ready.

01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:25.563
I love it.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.191
And I love you.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:32.153
Thank you.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.160
I love you so much.

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:46.102
So I'm going to say yes to Sam Lee.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:49.647
I think that you would like him
for me.

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.984
He's kind, he makes me laugh.

01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:55.737
And he makes room for you.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.238
He accepts the full me,

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.616
and he knows the full me
includes you.

01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:06.998
Sam.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.874
What are you doing?

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.250
I'm proposing to you.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.085
I'm in my underwear.

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:12.003
I don't care.

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:17.633
Sam Lee, you are my second chance.

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:20.678
You are the arms that helped
me pull myself back up.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.930
You're the life that I never saw coming.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.265
You are my reminder that life

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:25.850
can be unexpectedly beautiful,

01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:27.810
and I promise I will spend
the rest of our lives

01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:29.645
trying to be that reminder for you.

01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:32.774
Will you marry me?

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:33.191
Yes.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.109
Yes, will you marry me?

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.154
Yes, yes, yes.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:43.993
I wanna be happy and I want
more love in my life, Jesse.

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:47.789
So I'm asking for your
blessing to embrace it.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.248
Your love, Emma.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.343
You know what I thought
on our wedding day.

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:05.848
What.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:09.977
I was putting on my tux.
I was a little nervous.

01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:15.358
I just thought, at least
I picked the right person.

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:19.695
I always thought, no
matter how hard it got,

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:25.201
at least we picked the right person.

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:34.293
You gotta keep being the right person.

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:41.426
You have to change together

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:43.386
so that you can stay the right person.

01:18:45.096 --> 01:18:46.180
I wanna be with you.

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:50.143
So if staying in Acton for a bit
is important

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.144
then I will do it.

01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:52.061
A bit?

01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:52.895
As long as you need.

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:55.106
Jesse, I wanna stay here always.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.733
I want to continue our life here.

01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:00.153
Because of the store?

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:01.404
No, Jesse, it's not just
because of the store...

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:02.905
How about this?

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.032
We go on a big famous
bookstore tour of Europe

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.868
and we can see all the
world's greatest libraies.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.162
Jesse, I wanna stay here,
I wanna be with my family.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:17.128
You're asking me now that I am free,

01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:20.339
now that I can go anywhere

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:24.969
to chain myself to a
life that I can't live.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.310
My world is here, Jesse.

01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:35.855
I have people I love.

01:19:35.897 --> 01:19:39.400
I feel like I belong, like
I'm a part of something.

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:43.237
And I have found a peace with
myself here

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:46.949
that I never expected. This life

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:49.535
that my parents pushed on me, I
left it.

01:19:49.577 --> 01:19:51.412
And then I lived my own life.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:52.497
And then life brought me back to them.

01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:54.540
And now,

01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:00.296
I've chosen all of this.

01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.008
I've chosen it for myself.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:06.552
This is who I am now.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:10.973
You're different.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:12.016
Not in a bad way.

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:19.148
You just changed.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:24.278
See, the Emma I knew,

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:29.575
she wanted to be as far
away as humanly possible

01:20:29.617 --> 01:20:31.327
from Blair Books.

01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:34.622
And she was never gonna sit still

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.833
until she had seen the entire world.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:43.089
She loved me and only me.

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:49.845
That's not you anymore.

01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:53.849
No, it's not.

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:59.146
I promise we can
live any life you want.

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.398
Just not Acton.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:07.113
You're asking me to be
someone that I'm not anymore.

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:08.114
You're asking me to be someone

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.116
I always told you I wouldn't be.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:32.430
We didn't stay the right person.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:48.321
I could try and be the
right person for you.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:51.324
You can try and make yourself
the right person for me, but...

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:56.078
That's not real love.

01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:01.083
We should head back.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.136
You wanna stay here
just a little bit longer?

01:22:16.307 --> 01:22:17.183
Okay.

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.422
You know, there was a game
I used to play out there

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.721
and I'd just asked myself,
what's Emma doing right now?

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:57.264
And I'd say something like,

01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:00.184
I bet she's eating tapas in Barcelona

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:05.064
or she's on the beach
in Malibu. In Berlin.

01:23:06.691 --> 01:23:07.566
I was always wrong.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:14.156
You were here and I never
guessed here.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.706
I'm starting to see it.

01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:23.499
This is you.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.129
I never stopped loving you.

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:32.174
Do you believe me?

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.761
I'm really try to.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.641
One day you might.

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:42.601
I hope so.

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.314
Come on, let's go.

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:52.361
♪ Now our wild song are oldies ♪

01:23:55.197 --> 01:24:00.202
♪ Passion has begun to slip away

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:06.333
♪ The past spirals behind us ♪

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.588
♪ The future is a mystery ♪

01:24:13.591 --> 01:24:18.220
♪ And we are the stars that used

01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:30.608
After all that we
weren't meant to be, huh?

01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:34.528
I don't think things
have to last to be real.

01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:37.823
We can be meant to have been.

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:41.076
Meant to have been.

01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:43.621
Yeah.

01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:57.802
Thank you.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.137
For what?

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:02.223
The thought of seeing you again.

01:25:04.642 --> 01:25:05.810
You saved my life.

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:13.836
I know that for her,

01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:16.255
it's sometimes been him
and sometimes been me.

01:26:17.464 --> 01:26:19.300
For me, it's always been her.

01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:22.970
All right, that's the end of the day.

01:26:23.012 --> 01:26:26.473
I'm out of things to
say. It is what it is.

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:29.935
It's outta my hands now.

01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:31.437
It's Emma's choice to make.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:34.690
Mr. Lee.

01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:37.651
Isn't that exactly what
you did in high school?

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:38.611
What are you talking about?

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:39.862
She's right.

01:26:39.904 --> 01:26:42.948
You never just told Emma how you felt.

01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:45.326
You hinted at it, but you never
said it.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:48.329
Yeah, this Jesse guy,
he never makes it unclear.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.830
He wants her and he
always let her know that.

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:51.540
He puts it all out on the line.

01:26:51.916 --> 01:26:53.542
Yeah, if you're gonna go
down, Sam, go down swinging.

01:26:54.919 --> 01:26:55.961
Go tell this woman how

01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:56.670
heartbroken you'll be

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:57.463
without her.

01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:59.256
Yeah.

01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:02.217
Remind her of the life you
two could have had together.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:04.887
I can't lose her.

01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:06.889
Then do something about it.

01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:08.515
Yeah.

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.355
I gotta go, I gotta go.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:31.872
Thank you.

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:38.587
Sam!

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:41.590
Sam?

01:27:44.093 --> 01:27:45.678
Damn it.

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:47.930
Pick up your phone, man.

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.479
Oh, hey Marie. I, uh- Hello.

01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:57.481
I'm looking for Emma.

01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.858
Hey, hey.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.568
She's not here.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:02.820
Any idea where she went?

01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:05.406
Um, She, um...

01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:06.824
Just tell me.

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.075
I don't wanna tell you.

01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:08.951
Marie.

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:12.913
She... You know, um, she...

01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:15.290
She's with Jesse, right?

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:18.085
Look, I know, okay.

01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:20.004
I know.

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:21.588
And it's fine.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.799
Just, just tell me where they went.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:25.509
I can take it.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.470
They went to the cabin in Maine.

01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:40.774
Shit. Mother. Shit.

01:28:43.736 --> 01:28:44.611
As friends?

01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:48.407
As friends, right, right?

01:28:48.449 --> 01:28:50.951
It's a simple question.
As friends?

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:53.037
Did they go as friends? Were
they friends?

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.997
Were they friendly? Were
they platonically friends?

01:28:55.039 --> 01:28:56.957
I don't know how to answer that.

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:07.843
Sam.

01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:08.761
You're back.

01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:09.636
Is Sam here?

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:11.472
Yeah, he was just here.

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:12.473
He was looking for you.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:13.599
He was looking for me.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.976
Well, how did he seem,
hopeful, angry, devastated?

01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:18.020
At first he was hopeful.

01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:18.896
Oh, that's great.

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:20.606
And then I told him you went
to Maine

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:23.442
with Jesse and he got sort of devastated.

01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:28.405
Oh my God, Marie, I've ruined it.

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:29.448
No.

01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:31.575
I've completely ruined
it by loving them both.

01:29:31.617 --> 01:29:32.868
Also, though, um...

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.536
I've lost them both.

01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:36.371
Don't you think maybe you
should be

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:37.664
like a little more mad at me?

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.374
No, I'm not mad at you

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:42.419
because you were there for
me through all of this.

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:43.879
No, I'm not mad.

01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:45.130
You're not even a little mad

01:29:45.172 --> 01:29:46.840
for that day on the dock when
I convinced you your husband

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:48.467
was dead and it turned out I was
wrong?

01:29:48.509 --> 01:29:51.011
No, Marie, I was insane
that day on the dock.

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:53.013
If I had spent the last four years

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:55.641
believing that he was alive,
I would've lost my mind.

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:57.684
No, I did the best I
could with the information

01:29:57.726 --> 01:30:00.562
that I had and that led me to Sam.

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.774
I can't lose him Marie.

01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:07.986
So don't, go tell him
what you just told me.

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.696
You're right.

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:10.739
This isn't over yet.

01:30:14.118 --> 01:30:14.993
Let's go.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.788
Come on, come on.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.086
Pick up, pick up.

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:29.591
Hello.

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:30.300
Sam, can you hear me?

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:31.593
Emma, yeah, I can hear you.

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:32.886
Can you hear me?

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:36.181
Sam, I need you back.

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:37.015
Hello?

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:39.685
Jesse was gone and I was broken.

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:40.894
Emma, you're breaking up.
Hello?

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:45.858
But then I put myself back together

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:47.901
and the person that I became
chose you.

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:56.910
Sam! Sam.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:59.121
Sam, don't hang up.

01:30:59.163 --> 01:30:59.955
I just hit someone.

01:30:59.997 --> 01:31:03.208
Ah, honey, you hit me.

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:04.960
Shit, are you okay?

01:31:05.878 --> 01:31:08.046
No, no, I'm not.

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:09.882
I haven't slept in days.

01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:12.718
There's reporters camped
outside of our house.

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:15.762
I've lost all semblance of
privacy with my students.

01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:16.680
I'm terrible.

01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:17.389
Sam.

01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:18.765
No, no, I need to say something.

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:22.936
I need to, I've loved every
version of you

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:26.231
and I will love every version
of you that you become.

01:31:27.733 --> 01:31:32.237
I am madly in love with
you Em, and I'm in.

01:31:32.279 --> 01:31:35.824
I swear to God with every
fiber of my being, I am in.

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.786
But I refuse to settle for part
of you.

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:42.539
I need you to be in too.

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:45.959
I'm in, I'm in.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.962
I'm so sorry it took you so
long to understand that.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.590
Jesse was right for me once,
but you are right for me now.

01:31:51.632 --> 01:31:54.718
And I promise I will work
for the rest of my days

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.136
to be the right person to you.

01:31:56.178 --> 01:31:57.638
You be whoever you want.

01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:01.642
If you're in, I'm in, nothing
you do could ever change that.

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.562
I went to Maine with Jesse.

01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:08.815
I already said that I was in, okay.

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:10.901
Just save the rest for couples therapy.

01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:11.944
Okay.

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:17.950

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.828
You're a good man.

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:23.622
I'm all right.

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:31.171

01:32:31.213 --> 01:32:32.839

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.009

01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:42.015
Excuse me, can somebody
call an ambulance?

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:42.933
Yeah, thank you.

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.561
Hey, shut up, just go around.

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:49.731
We're fine, thank you.

01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:52.609
I love you.

01:32:52.651 --> 01:32:53.777
Oh, I love you too.

01:32:53.819 --> 01:32:55.195
Ah, sorry.

01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:57.030
No, no, no, it's fine,

01:32:57.072 --> 01:32:58.782
I just wanna be close to you.
