WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:07.716
Item four, the Jefferson Corridor Rapist
is still out there.

00:08.425 --> 00:12.512
Now, he's assaulted three elderly women
in the last 72 hours.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.890
This is a brutal perpetrator,
and we don't have much to work with.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.227
Partial descriptions from the victims
is on the duty board.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.563
We're coordinating with Jefferson Heights.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.565
Lieutenant Calletano is supervising.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.569
Item five, Operation "Wretched Refuse."

00:27.861 --> 00:30.864
The target is the
Intestinale Carting Company,

00:30.947 --> 00:32.866
Sal Intestinale proprietor.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.243
-(men coughing)
-This outfit is allegedly muscling out

00:35.326 --> 00:36.745
-the rival commercial carters.
-(blowing nose)

00:36.828 --> 00:39.831
It's, uh, also extorting local
businesses who might not be

00:39.914 --> 00:42.709
otherwise inclined
to use the Intestinale services.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.128
Uh, recent instances are broken arms,

00:45.211 --> 00:48.214
uh, a firebombing,
and one attempted murder.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.593
Sanitation is loaning us a truck
for the undercover.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.636
Belker, LaRue, and Washington,

00:53.720 --> 00:56.514
-they are our Dumpster detectives.
-(murmuring)

00:56.598 --> 00:58.933
Item six. Mayo, Garibaldi,
Worth, and Himmel

00:59.017 --> 01:00.769
are on hooker patrol, the red zone...

01:00.852 --> 01:02.687
-(wolf whistles)
- ...Dekker at 116th.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.899
Seven. Garden Holding Level, cell "B,"

01:05.982 --> 01:08.651
it's shut down
for electrical repairs today.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.569
-LARUE: Hey, Sarge, Sarge.
-What?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.321
I saw a light on in there.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.699
Yeah, well, as far as you're concerned,
it needs repairs.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.202
It's shut down.
It's off limits for today, okay?

01:17.994 --> 01:21.081
Okay, item eight.
Those of you who haven't signed up,

01:21.289 --> 01:23.875
the 10:30-to-2:30 slots are still open

01:23.958 --> 01:26.753
if you want to see
the department money-management advisor.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.006
Now, this is an annual
post-holiday service,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.008
provided by the personnel department.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.843
If you're already slotted, you're reminded

01:33.927 --> 01:36.471
you got to bring
the receipts and the bills

01:36.554 --> 01:38.515
when you go to your appointment, okay?

01:39.349 --> 01:45.313
Item nine. This afternoon,
we elect our precinct PBA representative.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.190
(cheers and applause)

01:47.273 --> 01:50.193
JABLONSKI: Now, as you all know,
after distinguished service,

01:50.276 --> 01:54.155
Lieutenant Calletano has declined
to seek another year in office.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.241
(murmuring)

01:56.533 --> 02:00.161
JABLONSKI: Now, our candidates
are Officer Andrew Renko--

02:00.245 --> 02:03.081
(cheers and applause)

02:03.164 --> 02:04.833
-MAN:<i> Jawohl!</i>
-Uh, my friends,

02:04.916 --> 02:07.627
uh, as you know,
I am the patrolmen's candidate.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.630
First of all, uh,
I am the uncommon common man

02:10.713 --> 02:13.299
and the only candidate
whose beat is the street.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.552
-Andy is dandy.
-(indistinct chatter)

02:15.635 --> 02:19.472
Our other candidates
are Lieutenant Henry Goldblume

02:19.556 --> 02:21.266
and Lieutenant Howard Hunter.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.268
-(man hissing)
-(applause)

02:23.685 --> 02:26.855
JABLONSKI: Okay, uh,
here are your ballots.

02:26.938 --> 02:30.233
-One-- one to a customer.
-Be sure you vote.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.026
Now, for those of you
who are interested...

02:32.110 --> 02:33.778
-Be sure you vote.
-...the candidates are gonna make

02:33.862 --> 02:38.032
statements in roll call,
0800 hours this morning.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.535
Good luck to all our candidates.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.996
I hope you realize
that is not an endorsement

02:43.079 --> 02:45.957
of any one of them
over all the others, okay?

02:46.374 --> 02:48.251
Uh, the last item...

02:49.169 --> 02:51.963
Last item concerns all this hocking,
the sneezing, and the wheezing

02:52.046 --> 02:53.882
that I've been hearing
going on in the squad room.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.050
Now, with the wind-chill
factor out there 20 below,

02:56.509 --> 02:58.094
many of you are regretting

02:58.178 --> 03:01.556
that you didn't heed
Jabo's hint on garlic...

03:01.639 --> 03:02.473
(men groaning)

03:02.557 --> 03:05.101
JABLONSKI: Garlic for an ounce
of prevention.

03:05.393 --> 03:09.522
All right, now here's Jabo's hint
on treatment for a pound of cure.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.399
(coughing, sneezing)

03:12.066 --> 03:13.193
Cider vinegar.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.028
-MAN: Oh, no.
-(man retching)

03:15.111 --> 03:16.988
-BOBBY: Mm-hmm.
-JABLONSKI: You gargle with it

03:17.071 --> 03:18.448
-every a.m. on arising.
-That's right. That's right.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.449
That's what Grandma used to say.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.285
All right, if you're a little squeamish,
you mix some honey with it.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.581
But I guarantee you,
you'll forget you ever had sinuses.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.833
-You'll forget your address.
-(laughter)

03:28.917 --> 03:30.210
All right, let's get out there.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.837
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.380
Sarge.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.968
Hey, Joe, do you have marshmallow bits
in that hot cocoa of yours?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.178
Can I please get one of those cards?

03:40.261 --> 03:41.679
JOE: What are you talking about, Renko?

03:41.971 --> 03:42.847
What do you mean marshmallow bits?

03:42.931 --> 03:46.643
If I'm elected, I guarantee you
you will have marshmallow bits.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.894
I don't even like marshmallow bits.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.103
Just like they do at City Hall.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.314
Hey, Renko, you think this financial
advisor might have some answers?

03:51.397 --> 03:52.315
I'd like to think so.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.693
All I could afford to buy Darryl Ann
for Christmas was a knit hat and gloves.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.863
Financially, my boat is stuck in the mud.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.741
Yeah, well, it beats being in a barrel
going over Niagara Falls.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.326
-Sarge.
-Hmm?

04:03.660 --> 04:06.537
The gentleman we're expecting
for Garden Level "B."

04:06.955 --> 04:08.957
Right, sure, uh, Mr. Eastman, uh...

04:09.123 --> 04:11.292
Take Mr. Eastman down
to his quarters, would you?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.252
Captain?

04:13.878 --> 04:15.296
Captain, I'm trying to be a sport,

04:15.380 --> 04:17.632
but this is the ninth time
I've been on hooker detail

04:17.715 --> 04:19.175
since I got here.
You know, at the Heights I--

04:19.259 --> 04:21.886
They don't have the same
prostitution problem, Patsy.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.097
Captain, Mr. Eastman's here.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.473
We're storing him in Garden-level holding.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.141
Good, Stanley. They take him out tonight?

04:27.225 --> 04:28.768
Yeah. Guy must be a heavyweight, huh?

04:28.851 --> 04:30.311
He's gonna be talking
before the grand jury?

04:31.229 --> 04:33.898
-Who is?
-Nobody. That cell's closed for repairs.

04:34.482 --> 04:39.112
Frank? Did you happen to send the check
to Dr. Rose for Frank Jr.'s teeth?

04:39.195 --> 04:42.115
-Oh, I forgot.
-Frank, I'd like to get it to him.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.367
-He's been very nice to us.
-Oh?

04:44.659 --> 04:47.203
Well, it's strictly business,
but he's gonna do my teeth too.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.997
Aren't you a little old for braces?

04:49.205 --> 04:50.748
Not at<i> these </i>prices, buster.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.208
Check will be in the mail today.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.210
(telephone ringing)

04:54.294 --> 04:56.087
-Sarge.
-Garbage man undercover.

04:56.170 --> 04:59.048
I get a complete change of wardrobe,
Belker switches gloves.

05:00.967 --> 05:01.801
-Sarge.
-What?

05:01.884 --> 05:04.470
Does that really work for you,
the-that thing with the vinegar?

05:05.054 --> 05:09.434
Mike, the only sick leave yours truly
has ever taken in 24 years

05:09.517 --> 05:10.768
was for the World Series.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.063
Now, they don't call me the "Iron J"
for nothing. (breathes raggedly)

05:14.814 --> 05:15.815
(sneezes)

05:17.358 --> 05:18.234
Dusty in here.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.528
-(telephone rings)
-Hmm.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.448
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:23.531 --> 05:25.325
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:29.120
<i>See Surplus store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:29.203 --> 05:30.788
(sirens wailing)

05:36.252 --> 05:38.880
(theme music playing)

06:53.371 --> 06:56.958
As I stood on that roof
surveying the streets and alleyways

06:57.333 --> 06:59.710
patrolled by officers
who have devoted themselves

06:59.794 --> 07:02.547
to the safety of an apathetic citizenry,

07:02.630 --> 07:07.427
I had a deep appreciation
of our profession's selfless constancy.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.637
And I was proud, gentlemen.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.597
-(man coughs)
-HUNTER: Proud.

07:13.516 --> 07:19.021
It was the sort of pride I felt
in the Mekong rice paddies

07:19.313 --> 07:21.274
during service in Vietnam.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.233
It's--

07:22.650 --> 07:24.861
-It's pride in fellowship.
-(groans)

07:25.361 --> 07:27.530
Despite that conflict's,
uh, inscrutability--

07:27.613 --> 07:29.490
-JABLONSKI: Sorry, Lieutenant--
-Excuse me.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.452
-Time.
-(man laughs)

07:32.535 --> 07:33.453
Oh.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.039
Uh, Hunter...

07:38.749 --> 07:41.210
your foes are mine.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.922
(applause)

07:46.382 --> 07:47.842
JABLONSKI: Our next speaker,
our next speaker

07:47.925 --> 07:50.511
is Officer Andrew Renko.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.889
-BOBBY: All right, Renko!
-(applause)

07:52.972 --> 07:57.518
ALL (cheering): Renko! Renko!
Renko! Renko! Renko!

08:02.982 --> 08:04.901
I just want to say a couple things.
(exhales)

08:11.824 --> 08:12.825
(inaudible)

08:14.327 --> 08:18.664
Uh, first of all, I'm the only,
uh, patrol officer running,

08:19.373 --> 08:21.209
and I know the interests
of the man on the street.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.920
Uh, second, um...

08:24.962 --> 08:27.882
I have held, uh, uh,
elected offices before.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.927
Uh, I was the captain
of the junior varsity baseball team

08:31.010 --> 08:32.887
out there at, uh, Monroe High School.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.556
-I don't know if you all know that.
-(mild laughter)

08:36.015 --> 08:39.018
HUNTER (chuckles):
We-We need more, uh, uh,

08:39.727 --> 08:42.438
overtime... less paperwork,

08:43.064 --> 08:44.774
and, uh, more officers on the beat.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.110
Rape assault, 48, 32nd, Furman Avenue.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.238
Oh, Lieutenant,
we have a-a call right now.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.073
Well, I guess that's
all I have time for, uh...

08:52.156 --> 08:56.494
Remember, vote often,
an-and vote for Andrew J. Renko.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.162
-Bobby Hill.
-BOBBY: You got it, Renk.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.498
(applause)

09:00.581 --> 09:02.416
Renko! Renko!

09:02.500 --> 09:05.002
(indistinct chatter)

09:05.086 --> 09:07.463
Now, your, uh,
garbage compactor's over here.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.632
Don't worry about it.
It don't work anyway.

09:10.174 --> 09:14.011
(grunts) Your ignition is, uh,
hanging down right here.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.764
-Now, your white lever's in the dump mode.
-(engine starts)

09:16.847 --> 09:18.099
Hey, you two, listen up.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.309
Your white lever's in the dump mode.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.395
Your red lever,
you gotta jiggle a little bit,

09:22.478 --> 09:23.729
brings her back down, you understand?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.147
All right, sir,
I think we got it now, huh?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.691
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.360
-Hey, zippy.
-Yeah.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.363
If it was up to me, you wouldn't come
anywhere near this truck.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.739
I don't care who you're after,

09:33.823 --> 09:36.867
they don't make refuse-collection vehicles
this fine anymore.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.662
Now, you gotta motor in that clock
and lift 'em out,

09:39.745 --> 09:40.871
and then put it right down
on your smart mouth!

09:41.247 --> 09:42.873
-Hey.
-We'll be careful with it, okay?

09:42.957 --> 09:44.917
Remember, she likes a lot of water, okay?

09:45.209 --> 09:48.045
-Who said you're driving?
-It came to me in a dream.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.881
You are not driving all day
while I pick up garbage.

09:50.965 --> 09:51.966
We'll take turns, Mick.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.926
Hey, why don't we decide
who picks up the garbage

09:54.010 --> 09:56.137
by who smells the most like it going in?

09:56.220 --> 09:57.346
-(growls)
-(growls)

09:58.931 --> 10:03.686
Remember, you is a beast
with a tail 28 feet long

10:03.769 --> 10:06.397
and shoulders seven feet wide,
so go gentle.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.356
All right, all right.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.900
We'll treat her like
the classic that she is.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.236
(engine revs)

10:15.323 --> 10:16.157
What the hell are you doing?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.658
You ain't going out of here in my truck!

10:17.742 --> 10:19.702
Just a joke, sir. Just a little humor.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.622
Come back with my truck!

10:23.247 --> 10:25.833
(gears grinding)

10:25.916 --> 10:28.085
WOMAN: They took me to the bathroom
and pushed me down.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.671
My face struck the metal pole
under the sink.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.089
BATES: Did they talk to you at all?

10:32.173 --> 10:34.508
They spoke among themselves
several times in Spanish,

10:34.592 --> 10:35.635
which I do not speak.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.179
(sighs) They went into my bedroom,

10:38.929 --> 10:41.307
and I heard them
pulling out drawers to the floor

10:41.390 --> 10:42.600
as they looked for valuables.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.853
This is the point
I hoped I'd only be robbed,

10:47.021 --> 10:48.981
but then, in a few minutes,
they came back in and...

10:50.024 --> 10:52.109
-and then I was assaulted.
-MAN: Yeah.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.486
Sexually.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.530
They both assaulted me sexually, correct.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.990
They assaulted me together.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.993
Okay, I wanna take her down
to the hospital now.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.537
Please! Now, wait a moment, young man!

11:05.790 --> 11:08.834
(crying) I-I want to give
my information first.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.420
I have memory accident.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.507
Please, now, before I forget.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.509
Take your time. Just go ahead.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.262
WOMAN: They were both average height.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.099
-How is she?
-WOMAN: They both wore black sneakers.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.601
(sighs) Well, they beat her up
pretty good, raped her.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.519
WOMAN: They wore wool-knit masks

11:26.602 --> 11:28.020
-all through the time.
-Two guys at once.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.147
A 72-year-old woman.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.567
One mask might have been black,
one was maroon.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.278
I couldn't see their faces.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.948
BATES: Did you notice any scars
or marks on their hands?

11:39.031 --> 11:40.783
I said they wore masks!

11:40.866 --> 11:44.578
Oh, on their<i> hands?</i>
I'm sorry, I didn't see.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.622
I'm Fay Furillo, Mrs. Tripp.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.332
-MRS. TRIPP: How do you do?
-How do you do?

11:49.125 --> 11:51.669
I work with the police department
as a victim's aide.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.587
I'll be accompanying you to the hospital,

11:53.671 --> 11:55.923
and then back to the precinct
if you feel up to it.

11:56.590 --> 12:00.970
I want to remember as much as I can
because I have memory accident.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.930
Mrs. Tripp, you did real good.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.890
In fact, we have everything
we need, I think.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.350
-You can go on and go to the hospital.
-Thank you.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.520
Would you like me to call someone
to meet us there?

12:09.770 --> 12:11.647
No. He passed away.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.274
-(indistinct chatter)
-Thank you.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.368
WOMAN (on radio):<i> All units, 2203,</i>
<i>Corridor Rape suspects</i>

12:24.452 --> 12:26.537

<i>black sneakers,</i>

12:26.620 --> 12:28.247

<i>northbound on Dixon and 127.</i>

12:41.719 --> 12:44.555
WOMAN (on radio):<i> ...east on Dekker</i>
<i>to 123rd, proceed south...</i>

12:44.638 --> 12:46.390
What'd you think of my campaign statement?

12:46.891 --> 12:47.725
It was good.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.269
-It stunk.
-Andy, it was fine.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.688
It didn't have no Mekong rice fields.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.231
Didn't have no Henry Goldblume,

12:54.315 --> 12:57.193
"I like to think of you as my friends.
Let's all work together as friends."

12:57.276 --> 13:00.321
Renko, those statements aren't
what people are gonna vote for.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.865
I watched them. I think you got
a real good chance to win.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.867
-Do you really?
-Yeah, I really do.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.744
Well, then don't you forget
to cast your ballot, Bobby Hill.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.787
What ballot?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.747
(both laugh)

13:11.373 --> 13:13.042
Maroon ski mask, look here.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.586
Renko, it's a wind-chill
minus-20 out there.

13:15.669 --> 13:16.921
I've been spendin' 20 minutes
lookin' at ski masks.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.422
There are a lot of ski masks
out on the streets.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.715
That is a maroon ski mask.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.717
-That's not a black ski mask.
-Right height.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.719
-That's not a blue ski mask.
-BOBBY: Right sneakers.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.346
RENKO: Yeah, let's just
give him a little...

13:25.721 --> 13:27.056
(siren wails)

13:27.139 --> 13:28.766
-RENKO: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
-BOBBY: 2202...

13:28.849 --> 13:31.101
(siren wails)

13:31.185 --> 13:32.812
(tires screech)

13:34.230 --> 13:36.106
BOBBY: We're now headed
south down alley...

13:43.447 --> 13:45.157
(siren stops)

13:48.536 --> 13:50.579
(siren wails)

13:51.789 --> 13:53.833
MAN (on radio):<i> 2216, heading north</i>
<i>through Market.</i>

13:54.667 --> 13:55.793
(tires squeal)

13:57.211 --> 14:01.257
2203, we got him.
Heading down an alley east off Williams.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.883
MAN (on radio):<i> 2216, we're in pursuit.</i>

14:04.552 --> 14:05.511
BATES: Hold it!

14:05.594 --> 14:07.054
(tires screech)

14:07.721 --> 14:09.807
BATES: Hold it! We got you!

14:10.766 --> 14:13.269
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Up against the wall.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.647
All right, where's the mask?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.607
He must've dumped the mask.
I'm gonna go find it.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.025
-All right, you're under arrest!
-All right, fellas!

14:20.109 --> 14:20.985
JOE: If you give up the
right to remain silent...

14:21.068 --> 14:22.736
Who saw where the guy
tossed that ski mask?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.364
Come on! It's gonna burn up!

14:26.115 --> 14:28.284
MAN: Wha--
I'll give you two bucks. Two bucks!

14:28.367 --> 14:31.370
-MAN: Two bucks!
-Come on!

14:31.704 --> 14:34.164
Right over here, lady! Over here!

14:39.295 --> 14:40.337
Over here, lady!

14:45.718 --> 14:47.344
Just read our ad, sir. Now look, sir.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.805
All we're asking you to do is
to take a look at our proposal.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.181
Okay? You just take
a look there, all right?

14:51.265 --> 14:54.059
Sir! Sir. Excuse me, sir.
Got a minute? Listen.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.020
LARUE: Who are you using presently?
All right. Got a minute?

14:56.103 --> 14:58.480
I'd like to talk to you guys
about our refuse-removal service.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.982
Hey, come on, man,
get away from our garbage.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.192
Hey! When it's in there, it's his.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.737
When it's in there, it's yours.
Out here it's in the public domain.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.113
LARUE: We gotta work harder
to win your trust.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.073
What the hell you want
this stuff for anyway?

15:08.157 --> 15:10.910
I got samples all the way back to 1964.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.871
-Samples of garbage?
-I study this stuff.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.623
Hey, the man's a garbologist, Mick.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.542
(laughs) Are you kidding me?

15:18.918 --> 15:22.588
Hoping to get a grant to establish
a national garbological archive.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.590
Right, sir. We're 40 percent cheaper.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.674
-Here you go, sir.
-Forty percent--

15:25.758 --> 15:27.343
Forty percent cheaper
for your carting service.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.344
-Forty percent, huh?
-Yep.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.553
This looks like a good deal to me.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.889
-You're crazy, Watkins.
-What am I gonna lose?

15:31.972 --> 15:33.641
Intestinale keeps raising the rates.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.684
I gotta use more and more
of his services every year.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.478
The man don't leave me nothin' to live on!

15:37.686 --> 15:39.605
MAN: Yeah? What are you gonna do
when a Dumpster

15:39.688 --> 15:41.148
comes flying through your window?

15:41.231 --> 15:44.610
You don't have to worry about muscle
from your present contractor.

15:44.693 --> 15:45.945
Now you read our flyer.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.905
Three Guys Disposal Company guarantees

15:47.988 --> 15:51.408
we're not only 40 percent cheaper,
we are 50 percent tougher.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.744
All right, let's see what you guys got.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.290
Mr. Watkins, what's going on? Whose truck?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.918
Two weeks you don't pick up my trash.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.252
Now, I got another outfit.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.422
Well, we didn't pick up because you forgot
to sign your new contract, right?

16:05.506 --> 16:06.507
WATKINS: I didn't forget.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.509
I'm not gonna pay the extra money either.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.427
I called Intestinale and said so.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.224
Oh. Well, why don't we go inside
and talk about it?

16:15.432 --> 16:17.685
-I think we can work this out.
-Leave him alone, hairball.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.562
You must be Mr. 50 percent tougher.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.315
Well, you don't look so tough to me.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.359
You just look like 50 percent.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.115
(glass breaks)

16:31.573 --> 16:32.616
-Don't be foolish, pal.
-Hey, hey!

16:32.700 --> 16:35.869
-(groans)
-Don't do that!

16:35.953 --> 16:38.539
-Hey, stay right there.
-You're making a big mistake, pal.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.208
I want you to pay me for the mirror.

16:43.961 --> 16:44.878
All right.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.297
Here. Keep the change.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.592
-(man chuckles)
-You don't want a receipt?

16:50.676 --> 16:51.885
MAN: Turn him right around, huh?

16:52.761 --> 16:54.054
Yeah, I'll pick it up tomorrow.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.390
Carl!

16:56.724 --> 16:58.142
Yeah, go on, Carl.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.647
You tell the Intestinales
that Three Guys Garbage is doing business.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.107
Just tell 'em we're staying.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.609
Yeah, and I'll bring his answer back, too.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.572
Hey, Mr. Watkins. (sniffs)
You smell anything burnin'?

17:11.655 --> 17:14.575
-Yeah, go right ahead, threaten me.
-MAN: Yeah.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.951
WATKINS: I ain't scared
of you guys no more.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
MAN: That's right. You got a new customer.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.872
MAN 2: We don't have to be
scared no more, you see? See?

17:20.289 --> 17:23.042
-(engine starts)
-MAN: Yeah, with these guys...

17:24.334 --> 17:29.256
Leo, Eddie Santiago,
resisting, suspicion of rape,

17:29.339 --> 17:31.800
suspicion of assault,
suspicion of robbery.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.552
JABLONSKI: Where's the ski mask?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.846
Couldn't recover it.
He threw it in a trash fire.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.265
Get him into interrogation right away.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.478
Call in the earlier victims.
See if they can I.D. him.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.571
RAY:<i> Dime todo lo que sepas,</i>
<i>pero dímelo todo.</i>

17:52.654 --> 17:55.449
<i>Yo no quería violar la señora.</i>
<i>Nomás quería robarla.</i>

17:55.741 --> 17:58.035
He says raping Mrs. Tripp
was his partner's idea.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.411
He only wanted to rob her.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.414
<i>Yo le digo todo. Fue idea de Luis.</i>

18:02.790 --> 18:04.333
He'll make a deal
implicating the other one.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.501
What's the other one's name?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.252
<i>¿Cuál es el apellido de Luis?</i>

18:07.461 --> 18:08.754
Cordera. Luis Cordera.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.756
-Luis Cordera.
-Gentlemen.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.300
(telephone ringing)

18:13.717 --> 18:15.427
Mr. Santiago, I'm your lawyer.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.639
You shouldn't be giving a statement
until we've conferred.

18:18.722 --> 18:19.932
Statement's voluntary, Counselor.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.226
-Mr. Santiago is cutting a deal.
-(siren wails)

18:22.309 --> 18:23.977
JOYCE: That's another
conversation, Captain.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.687
-Will you excuse us, please?
-Absolutely.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.358
(sighs)

18:31.819 --> 18:33.987
-Here's lunch.
-MR. EASTMAN: Delicious, delicious.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.490
Yeah, you haven't had
our mystery-meat sandwich yet.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.743
Hey, to the hungry soul,
every bitter thing is sweet.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.079
-You know who I am?
-We hear rumors.

18:42.162 --> 18:42.996
Like what?

18:43.288 --> 18:45.040
(chuckles) Like you're an opera star.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.834
That's right. (laughs)

18:47.084 --> 18:50.129
I'm gonna sing to the grand jury,
and then I'm gonna start a whole new life.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.964
-Well, good luck.
-What's your name?

18:52.756 --> 18:53.590
Natalie.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.343
There's five different contracts
out on me, Natalie.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.179
But, you know, I don't fear no evil

19:00.430 --> 19:02.808
because I got a personal relationship
with the Lord.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.977
Let me tell you, Jimmy Fisher had it all,

19:05.060 --> 19:07.646
beautiful houses, nice cars,
beautiful women, but,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.314
but even then, I was a spiritual person.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.108
It didn't make me happy,
you know what I'm sayin'?

19:11.942 --> 19:13.360
-I guess.
-I said to myself,

19:14.945 --> 19:19.241
"What is all this stuff, this,
this wealth, this fantastic luxury?"

19:19.449 --> 19:21.034
I mean, to the whole world,
I was a big shot,

19:21.118 --> 19:22.327
I was Jimmy Fisher,

19:22.786 --> 19:24.163
but inside, I was a bum.

19:25.205 --> 19:28.208
The Bible says, "They have ears
but hear not," and that was me.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.169
God turned you around?

19:31.086 --> 19:34.464
What turned me around was that I found out
the Feds had me wiretapped for ten months.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.383
My chauffeur was an undercover agent.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.386
I found out that the Scarbalones
had a hit out on me, it was...

19:39.928 --> 19:41.847
It was like two halves
of the scissors closing shut...

19:44.016 --> 19:45.767
and then the Savior came into my life.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.561
He lifted me out of my despair.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.772
I confessed all my sins to Him,
the Mandalvi killings, some other stuff,

19:50.856 --> 19:53.942
stuff the Feds don't even know about,
and He understood.

19:54.985 --> 19:58.280
"Though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be white as snow."

19:58.655 --> 20:00.324
And that's when you decided to squeal.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.783
I said to myself, "I'll take my chances

20:01.867 --> 20:03.619
"with the Scarbalones
and those other guys,

20:04.661 --> 20:06.538
but I wanna be at peace
with the man upstairs."

20:07.456 --> 20:09.541
Yeah, well, I gotta go now, Mr. Fisher.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.293
I'll come back and get your tray later.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.129
Sure. Would you like to stay around awhile
and read the Good Book with me?

20:14.838 --> 20:16.131
Maybe later. (chuckles)

20:16.506 --> 20:19.384
He's knocking, Natalie. Let him in.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.345
(telephone ringing)

20:21.428 --> 20:23.764
We can do these tomorrow, too, Mrs. Tripp.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.265
You just holler if you're feeling tired.

20:25.349 --> 20:30.229
I will. The fact is, I'm worried
about going home just now.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.730
I'm-I'm a little afraid.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.942
When the time comes, if you want,
I'll be happy to go home with you.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.526
I'd be grateful.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.695
And I'll stay till you throw me out.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.239
-(chuckles)
-FURILLO: Mrs. Tripp?

20:40.989 --> 20:43.408
Oh, excuse me. Yes?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.452
I'm sorry. I'm Captain Furillo.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.453
How do you do?

20:46.870 --> 20:47.704
How are you?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.582
I'm very sorry for what's
happened to you today.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.835
Mrs. Furillo's been a great help.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.629
Are you related?

20:57.297 --> 20:58.173
Coincidence.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.717
Uh, for what it's worth,

21:00.801 --> 21:02.719
I want you to know
we have a suspect in your case.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.763
Is that so? You have one of the men?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.724
Well, he's a very strong suspect.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.935
I'm so sorry I didn't see him, Captain.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.980
Uh, uh, I could help
with the identification.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.898
We're hoping that won't be necessary.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.401
Uh, if you'll excuse me.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.611
You're in very good hands here.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.281
Yes, I am.

21:22.864 --> 21:23.740
Thank you, Captain.

21:28.203 --> 21:31.248
-I just had intake with Eddie Santiago.
-That's his victim.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.750
JOYCE: I don't think his
confession's usable, Frank.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.919
-Why not?
-He wasn't qualified on Miranda.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.462
Coffey read him his rights at the scene.

21:37.546 --> 21:41.842
Santiago doesn't speak English.
He only speaks Spanish.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.927
His rights were read
to him only in English.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.013
-FAY: And then answer one through nine.
-No sale.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.556
-The man was given his rights.
-FAY: ...ten and 11.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.516
If he didn't understand them,
he didn't get 'em.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.480
MRS. TRIPP: Thank you.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.399
FAY: More of the same kind of questions.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.404
Did anyone hear him speak English?

22:02.487 --> 22:04.448
Did he speak English
to anybody here at any time?

22:04.531 --> 22:06.450
Captain, when I asked him
if he understood his rights,

22:06.533 --> 22:08.994
I thought he said "yeah",
he acted like he understood.

22:09.202 --> 22:12.122
And besides that on his license
it doesn't say "Eduardo", it says "Eddie."

22:13.373 --> 22:15.751
Damn it, Ray, why didn't somebody give him
his rights again in Spanish?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.961
I assumed Ramirez
had given him his rights.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.004
It is checked on the sheet,

22:19.379 --> 22:21.590
and Ramirez was among the officers
who arrested him.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.718
All right, let's move on.
Where are we now?

22:24.801 --> 22:26.094
We're looking for the accomplice.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.014
We also have the earlier rape victims
coming in for lineup.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.183
Maybe we won't need Santiago's confession.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.436
Okay. Ray, run Santiago's record
through Board of Education,

22:34.519 --> 22:35.937
Immigration, and Naturalization.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.231
-Corrections also?
-Yeah, good.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.360
Joe, Lucy, get a warrant
for Santiago's apartment.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.362
Also canvass his neighborhood,
talk to anybody who knows him

22:43.445 --> 22:44.613
and might have heard him speak English.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.573
-BATES: We're on our way.
-We're close here, people.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.992
-Let's not lose this one.
-(indistinct chatter)

22:49.576 --> 22:51.661
Corridor Rape victims
are ready in lineup, Captain.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.498
HENRY: Turn to your left.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.296
No, I'm sorry. I don't see him.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.506
Take your time, ma'am.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.927
I would remember him, Officer.
He isn't there.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.015
Okay. Thanks for coming in.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.064
That's it.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.692
HENRY: 0 for three, I don't think
Santiago did the earlier rapes.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.236
(sighs) Are we done?

23:25.153 --> 23:27.322
Need a translator to tell your client
he wasn't made?

23:28.365 --> 23:30.033
I don't like your tone, Lieutenant.

23:30.826 --> 23:34.037
We're still gonna hold Santiago
for the rape assault of Mrs. Tripp.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.665
That'll last till we get before a judge.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.253
Maybe we get lucky
with Santiago's running mate.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.923
-(siren wailing)
-This is unit 2202 in vehicle pursuit.

23:45.006 --> 23:50.846
Blue Ford van, license number 39LPG41,
registered to a Luis Cordera,

23:50.929 --> 23:52.681
headed west on Hillary toward Lamont.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.141
-Requesting backup, please.
-BOBBY: Okay, hold on.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.893
(siren wailing)

23:58.812 --> 24:00.439
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>All units, request backup.</i>

24:00.522 --> 24:03.733
<i>Rape suspect in blue van,</i>
<i>heading north on Lamont toward Maple.</i>

24:03.817 --> 24:04.943
-Come on!
-Where to?

24:05.026 --> 24:06.778
-Where do you think?
-Hey, man, we'll blow our cover.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.155
Aw, come on, let's go!

24:08.363 --> 24:10.991
(intense music playing)

24:11.074 --> 24:14.244
-(tires squealing)
-(siren wailing)

24:19.791 --> 24:22.752
We're going east on 126 toward 127.

24:27.549 --> 24:31.386
(indistinct talking over police radio)

24:35.265 --> 24:37.851
Headed south down
Sievers Alley in pursuit.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.979
Request backup.
Try to cut us off out on Lamont.

24:48.361 --> 24:49.196
What are you doing?

24:50.864 --> 24:52.866
(siren wailing)

24:53.992 --> 24:56.286
(tires squealing)

25:01.541 --> 25:04.294
-What are you doing, Belker?
-(siren wails)

25:07.589 --> 25:08.507
(siren stops)

25:11.635 --> 25:12.594
Oops.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.767
Man, you see me walkin'! Why you pushin'?

25:18.850 --> 25:22.187
Bingo, Leon Luis Cordera,
rape, robbery, and assault.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.605
-Let's go.
-Take a walk here, pal.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.733
-Excuse me. Officer Hill?
-Thompson.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.153
Thompson Financial Counseling Services.
Actually, I'm Mr. Bowers.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.948
Mr. Thompson's in Florida
this winter doing taxes.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.367
Uh, look, uh, maybe we should reschedule.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.702
You don't have to reschedule nothin'.
I can take care of this creep.

25:40.205 --> 25:43.833
-I hope you ate your Wheaties today.
-I want my P.D., man. I want a lawyer!

25:43.917 --> 25:45.001
-Stan?
-What?

25:45.627 --> 25:47.420
When can we get the Corridor victims
back here?

25:47.504 --> 25:49.673
-They probably just got home.
-Well, get 'em back.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.550
-Get him counseled and get him on it.
-Yes, sir.

25:51.925 --> 25:52.759
Frank?

25:53.885 --> 25:56.763
Immigration shows Santiago came here
three years ago from Ecuador.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.099
Is there a record of his enrollment
in an English class?

25:59.182 --> 26:02.477
None. Welfare and Corrections department
are also a "no."

26:02.811 --> 26:03.853
We're checking Unemployment.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.772
Bates and Coffey just called
from Santiago's apartment.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.607
All they found is a couple
copies of "El Diario."

26:07.691 --> 26:08.692
What'd the neighbors say?

26:08.775 --> 26:10.735
Nobody's ever heard him speak English.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.154
I had 'em wrap it up there
and check Cordera's place.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.364
All right, let's get them a warrant.

26:14.447 --> 26:15.657
Anything else I should know about,

26:15.740 --> 26:18.201
where officers on this case
have been assigned, Henry?

26:18.285 --> 26:19.160
Ray!

26:19.786 --> 26:22.038
When Bates and Coffey called,
they asked for<i> you.</i>

26:22.622 --> 26:25.417
I just happened to have a pen
and some paper with me.

26:28.628 --> 26:31.798
-What's the trouble?
-I am coordinating officer in charge.

26:32.299 --> 26:35.218
If I'm taking the blame
for Santiago's case,

26:35.302 --> 26:38.179
shouldn't I also have the responsibility
of running it?

26:38.263 --> 26:39.222
In my office.

26:44.728 --> 26:48.023
I understand you're feeling bad
about what happened to Santiago, Ray,

26:48.106 --> 26:49.983
but taking it out
on other people won't help.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.943
That was not my mistake alone, Frank.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.863
And it is not the only thing
I feel badly about around here.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.533
What else?

26:59.659 --> 27:00.785
The PBA election.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.873
-What about it?
-I worked tirelessly for these men.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.500
I fought tooth and nail
on the dental benefits.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.003
I was the best PBA representative
they ever had.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.213
And I know the men
appreciated your efforts.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.759
And if they did, don't you think someone
would have come to me when I stepped aside

27:15.842 --> 27:17.218
and asked me to reconsider?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.638
Damn it, Ray! You willingly step down.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.806
Then you get upset
because the men respect your decision.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.183
We're not mind readers.

27:24.684 --> 27:27.187
If you don't mind my saying so,
given the Santiago botch,

27:27.270 --> 27:29.731
I wouldn't think now is a good time
for ruffled feathers.

27:31.399 --> 27:32.817
You're right. I'm sorry.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.029
I made a mistake,
and I feel badly about it.

27:36.946 --> 27:37.906
We<i> all </i>do.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.866
Should I get the warrant
on Cordera's apartment?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.117
Please.

27:48.541 --> 27:49.918
A, B, C.

27:50.418 --> 27:53.171
Now, your "C" pile,
your nonrecurring sources of debt,

27:53.254 --> 27:55.215
Right? The florist, uh, tire shop,

27:55.298 --> 27:56.883
bills you have every intention
of paying someday,

27:57.133 --> 27:58.385
but for now we put 'em on the back burner.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.302
-Right?
-Right.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.097
Right. "B" pile,
recurring sources of debt,

28:02.430 --> 28:04.849
phone, utilities, et cetera, so on.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.643
-Uh, small weekly payments.
-Right.

28:06.726 --> 28:07.852
Yeah. "A."

28:07.936 --> 28:09.896
-(taps tabletop)
-Your nuclear alert.

28:09.979 --> 28:13.775
The head full of snakes,
what you guys call our dispatch code 1033.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.859
-All right.
-Right.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.404
Okay, exhibit "A",

28:17.487 --> 28:19.656
Uncle Sam licking his chops
for that 7,200.

28:19.739 --> 28:22.492
-(taps tabletop)
-Well, what do we do?

28:23.410 --> 28:24.786
I think you're jammed up, Bobby.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.707
Frankly, I wouldn't rule out
the old blue-collar two-step, chapter 11.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.001
(sighs) Mr. Bowers,
nothing against piles A, B, and C,

28:32.085 --> 28:35.880
but I thought you were gonna be
talking about ways to refinance.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.967
No, Bob, I'm a private
financial counselor.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.136
Every year, the department
hires Mr. Thompson,

28:41.219 --> 28:43.388
or, in this case, me to come in here,

28:43.471 --> 28:46.141
talk to you guys about money management.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.934
-Look...
-(Bobby sighs)

28:48.643 --> 28:52.313
Bobby, if this thing
is gettin' to the point

28:52.397 --> 28:54.899
where it's murderin'
your personal life, your job,

28:55.150 --> 28:58.236
there is one final possibility
that I'm gonna whisper just to you,

28:58.319 --> 28:59.821
but, uh, this is off the record, right?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.407
-Official counseling session's over.
-I'm listening.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.118
I might know
where you can borrow the dough,

29:06.202 --> 29:08.663
but the interest
would be highly substantial.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.251
-How substantial?
-A point a week.

29:15.211 --> 29:18.465
This is not from a bank,
this is not from a finance company.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.595
But could this be done today?

29:24.012 --> 29:26.973
Could be four o'clock. Interested?

29:27.891 --> 29:31.102
Yeah, I'm interested. How do I apply?

29:31.811 --> 29:32.729
You just did.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.317
Frank, you want to bring me up
to speed on this Santiago mess?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.235
We're waiting for lab results
and microfibers

29:39.319 --> 29:41.404
and making inquiries
into his English competency.

29:41.488 --> 29:44.616
I.E., we have a failure to I.D. in lineup
and a confession tainted

29:44.699 --> 29:46.534
because we can't prove
Santiago understood his rights.

29:46.618 --> 29:50.955
What we also have is Mrs. Bernstein's son
riding into court on a flying carpet.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.165
We're still working on it, Irwin.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.834
Can you get me the woman in court
to swear the complaint?

29:54.918 --> 29:56.211
She's had a hell of a day.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.881
Frank, I've got no admissible confession,
no other evidence to ask for bail on.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.800
At least let me get the sympathy vote.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.218
-I'll ask.
-Captain, as soon as you can.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.845
Yeah, he's all yours.
I got to go take my lumps in court.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.764
(telephone ringing)

30:08.014 --> 30:10.517
Ms. Davenport... Jake Tempkin.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.228
-I just got Luis Cordera.
-Mr. Tempkin.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.104
I hear you, uh, represent
Cordera's partner.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.981
-Correct.
-Heard he confessed.

30:17.565 --> 30:20.985
How about we throw him my slow curve
and, uh, call for a postponement,

30:21.069 --> 30:22.862
tell 'em, uh, I haven't
had time to prepare?

30:23.279 --> 30:25.615
How about we get to court
and you defer to my defense?

30:25.824 --> 30:26.658
Which is?

30:26.991 --> 30:29.035
My client's confession is inadmissible,

30:29.536 --> 30:32.539
and his confession is all that links
your client with the crime.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.166
(clears throat)
I'll just hold off on that curve.

30:35.708 --> 30:36.793
-Joyce?
-Sounds good.

30:37.043 --> 30:38.962
-You got time for a quick lunch?
-Actually, no.

30:39.045 --> 30:41.130
Uh, we have to be in court
in about a half an hour, Irwin.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.299
We gotta eat.
We got to keep up our strength.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.844
Look, I'm brown-bagging.
I've got enough for two.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.554
Why don't we, uh, have a quick picnic?

30:48.137 --> 30:49.931
Now, where's a nice, shady tree?

30:52.141 --> 30:53.059
Perfect.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.771
Apple, or a cheese sandwich?

30:57.438 --> 30:59.232
-Cheese.
-Excellent choice.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.445
<i>Grazie.</i>

31:05.905 --> 31:06.739
<i>Prego.</i>

31:08.575 --> 31:11.244
Eddie Santiago wouldn't be
on the menu, would he, Irwin?

31:11.327 --> 31:13.830
Mm-hmm. It's a whole different agenda.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.915
Hmm. A herd of larcenists?

31:16.249 --> 31:18.585
No. Listen... (exhales)

31:19.502 --> 31:23.256
I have been offered chief prosecutor
for the south bureau.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.259
-Irwin, that's great.
-Yeah.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.972
The D.A. and I have been talking
about who would fill my slot.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.309
-Your name's been mentioned.
-You're kidding.

31:34.392 --> 31:38.688
No, the D.A. thinks you are a trouper,
judges adore you,

31:38.897 --> 31:41.024
and your integrity is unimpeachable.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.986
So I have been authorized
to offer you the job.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.489
Forty-four thousand to start,
five weeks' vacation,

31:49.198 --> 31:51.743
unimaginable expense account,
as you can see.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.913
And I know what you're gonna say, Joyce,
I know, but before you do--

31:54.996 --> 31:57.040
-You don't have to.
-I don't have to what?

31:57.123 --> 31:59.626
Explain to me how our jobs
aren't really that different.

31:59.709 --> 32:03.254
Your job is to push the sewage
through the system untreated.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.715
Mine is to fish the juicy gobbets out.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.175
Irwin...

32:09.010 --> 32:09.928
Sorry.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.429
(apple crunches)

32:11.930 --> 32:12.931
The fact is, Joyce,

32:13.806 --> 32:17.185
we both work for the same
waste-management project.

32:17.644 --> 32:21.022
You know, truthfully...
the offer's a surprise,

32:21.439 --> 32:24.067
but my reaction's not what it would
have been four years ago.

32:24.817 --> 32:27.153
Four years ago, this would
have sounded like treason.

32:28.488 --> 32:34.577
Joyce, don't you ever get tired
of feeling wrong, even when you're right,

32:34.911 --> 32:37.538
when you win a case
but you know the guy did the crime?

32:38.373 --> 32:39.916
Irwin, I believe in the right to counsel.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.501
No question.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.837
I'm talking about personal feelings.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.048
I'm talking about feeling bad personally.

32:48.091 --> 32:51.052
The answer is-- the short answer's yes.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.012
Sometimes I do.

32:54.263 --> 32:57.350
-I won't totally say no yet, Irwin.
-Good.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.644
But it sure feels weird.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.312
Joyce...

33:03.147 --> 33:07.443
when bald-headed Bernstein
puts a psychopath off the street,

33:07.986 --> 33:09.445
he never has any mixed feelings.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.115
Bernstein feels like John Wayne.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.117
Let's go to court, Duke.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.327
(apple crunches)

33:17.578 --> 33:19.122
JABLONSKI: Van's waiting.
Better move those people out.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.249
Are you sure you're up to
going to court, Mrs. Tripp?

33:21.332 --> 33:22.333
I'm up to anything

33:22.417 --> 33:23.793
-that helps send these men to prison.
-NATALIE: All right, gentlemen.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.546
Hands on each other's arms,
right up in front.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.548
Let's move along here. Come on.

33:28.631 --> 33:34.137
3:00 p.m., election for the PBA
representative is now officially over.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.514
-Sarge.
-Ballot counting will commence.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.891
Get out the old abacus now, Sergeant.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.226
Meaning exactly what?

33:42.186 --> 33:44.772
Well, nothing, uh... (clears throat)
It was an attempt at humor.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.608
When it comes to the
electoral process, Lieutenant,

33:47.692 --> 33:49.944
Jablonski's got a zero sense of humor.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.071
LEO: Hill Street, Officer Schnitz.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.532
Neck and neck with his I.Q.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.535
Watkins Hill House, right?

33:59.620 --> 34:00.455
Yeah.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.874
Peppy, Levitt...

34:03.750 --> 34:04.792
firebomb, you guys.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.796
(siren wailing)

34:08.880 --> 34:10.423
(indistinct talking over police radio)

34:12.592 --> 34:13.551
(wailing stops)

34:21.976 --> 34:23.019
MAN: Watkins Hill House.

34:23.436 --> 34:27.815
One fatality, store owner,
I.D.'d as Mel Watkins, D.O.A.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.442
-Car bomb...
-Excuse me, please.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.819
-(coughing)
-Open up, please. This lady's hurt.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.781
(indistinct talking over police radio)

34:34.864 --> 34:37.825
Who saw what happened?
Did you see what happened?

34:38.034 --> 34:38.868
<i>You </i>happened.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.329
You convinced George Watkins

34:41.496 --> 34:44.290
that you could protect him
from the Intestinales.

34:44.624 --> 34:45.625
Now they've killed him.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.586
Forty percent cheaper, 50 percent tougher.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.880
How about 100 percent deader?

34:52.298 --> 34:54.634
Why don't you show 'em
how tough you are now?

35:01.808 --> 35:04.102
Mrs. Louise Tripp, deponent, states

35:04.185 --> 35:07.772
that defendants Eddie Santiago
and Luis Cordera

35:07.939 --> 35:10.817
forcibly entered her home
and committed sexual acts

35:10.900 --> 35:12.527
upon her against her will,

35:12.693 --> 35:15.571
rendering her grievous
bodily harm, so sworn.

35:19.575 --> 35:21.035
Um, Counsel, approach, please.

35:22.036 --> 35:25.248
Sergeant... please, will you join us?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.418
All right. Now what do we have here?

35:29.710 --> 35:31.838
Co-defendant Santiago
made a full confession

35:31.921 --> 35:32.880
following his arrest, Your Honor.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.090
Objection.

35:36.717 --> 35:40.555
My client, Mr. Santiago, was not advised
as to his rights upon arrest.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.640
Arresting officers read him his rights.

35:42.890 --> 35:46.894
In English, which Mr. Santiago
neither understands nor speaks.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.439
The people's case is totally based
on an inadmissible statement.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.858
They have no other evidence.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.820
-You give Mr. Santiago Miranda?
-Yes.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.656
He give you any indication
it was Greek to him?

35:59.532 --> 36:00.366
No.

36:00.449 --> 36:03.411
-He give you any indication it wasn't?
-No.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.663
Uh-huh.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.835
Hey, you there at the defense table,
your fly is open!

36:11.085 --> 36:12.170
(people chuckle)

36:14.255 --> 36:15.214
(clears throat)

36:19.969 --> 36:21.554
Looks like you're on the money, Joycie.

36:22.388 --> 36:25.349
Also, Mr. D.A., I note here,
defendants are not suspect

36:25.433 --> 36:27.226
in other recent geriatric rapes

36:27.310 --> 36:30.521
by virtue of incompatible
blood types, right?

36:30.605 --> 36:32.607
That is apparently correct,
Your Honor. Mm-hmm.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.400
Thank you very much. Stand back.

36:40.573 --> 36:41.490
JUDGE: Mrs. Tripp?

36:42.241 --> 36:46.329
The court is sensitive
to the grievous harm done to you...

36:47.788 --> 36:51.125
but I'm afraid that the case
against these men is so minimal,

36:52.376 --> 36:53.961
the court cannot, in good conscience,

36:54.045 --> 36:56.839
set the high bail
such charges usually dictate.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.387
So 1,000 dollars,
ten percent cash alternative.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.764
-(gavel bangs)
-Next case.

37:04.847 --> 37:05.973
-Can you make bail?
-LUIS: Yeah.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.185
-What?
-BAILIFF: 22J37...

37:09.268 --> 37:11.145
-FURILLO: Mrs. Tripp?
-MRS. TRIPP: (indistinct)

37:11.229 --> 37:12.730
-Mrs. Tripp, they're--
-Are they going free?

37:12.813 --> 37:14.357
They're-- No, no, no, no.
They're going to stand trial.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.608
I don't understand.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.068
-No, they'll stand trial.
-Why are they getting out?

37:17.151 --> 37:19.362
It's just bail. They'll stand trial.

37:19.445 --> 37:22.698
-When? In four months? Six?
-FAY: No. I don't know.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.243
MRS. TRIPP: How many more women
will they be allowed to do this to?

37:25.701 --> 37:29.455
-I don't know.
-They go free, and I'm afraid to go home.

37:30.581 --> 37:34.043
Let me ask you something, who's in jail?

37:36.295 --> 37:38.547
(crying)

37:56.857 --> 37:58.526
(indistinct chatter)

37:58.609 --> 37:59.652
-Hey, Bobby.
-Hey.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.612
Right on time. This is, uh, Walter.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.115
-Hi, Walter.
-Good news, Bob. You've been accepted.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.410
-Great!
-7,200 dollars.

38:07.702 --> 38:08.619
Weekly payments,

38:08.703 --> 38:10.830
interest is a point a week
on the outstanding balance.

38:10.913 --> 38:12.123
All right, you're under arrest.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.625
BOBBY: Violation of state section 7...

38:14.709 --> 38:16.085
-Hey, Bob.
-...of set usury law.

38:16.168 --> 38:18.671
What's going on here?
I'm tryin' to help you budget your money.

38:18.754 --> 38:20.840
Uh, anything between you guys,
I'm not privy to, huh?

38:20.923 --> 38:22.883
-Save it, creep!
-You have the right to remain silent.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.761
-You have the right to an attorney.
-You have the right to remain silent.

38:25.845 --> 38:26.721
(hinge squeaks)

38:27.096 --> 38:29.390
I'm telling you, I wanna see Intestinale.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.517
I told you, Mr. Intestinale's
gettin' a shave.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.145
-He can't see you now.
-(screams)

38:35.479 --> 38:37.773
(glass shatters)

38:38.566 --> 38:40.776
Hey, hey, hey! What's all the commotion?

38:41.152 --> 38:42.278
You Sal Intestinale?

38:43.654 --> 38:45.197
One... two...

38:46.073 --> 38:46.991
three.

38:47.616 --> 38:50.536
Let me guess,
Three Guys Garbage Company, right?

38:50.619 --> 38:53.581
-You killed Watkins!
-Mike! Mike! Mike!

38:54.874 --> 38:58.419
SAL: Put the gun away, man.
It's bothering my niece.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.547
Twenty minutes, Mr. I?

39:02.048 --> 39:04.258
Yeah, baby. Twenty minutes.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.553
(laughs) You guys got names?

39:07.970 --> 39:11.891
Yeah, I'm John Longstreet.
That's Neil Jefferson.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.601
This here's Mike. He's a little excitable.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.812
No, he's all right. I can tell.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.941
Come on in. Everything's under control.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.695
You're the tough guys.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.572
(laughs) I saw your ad.

39:27.865 --> 39:28.741
Tell me something.

39:29.116 --> 39:32.703
You come into my territory,
advertising 50 percent tougher.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.205
Now, what is that?

39:35.289 --> 39:38.417
To me, it indicates, uh,
a lack of respect. Hmm.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.796
I mean, could it be, really,
that you're only 30 percent as tough?

39:42.630 --> 39:44.548
Or ten percent? (laughs)

39:44.632 --> 39:46.050
-(grunts)
-Hey!

39:46.342 --> 39:50.888
I mean, maybe you're, uh,
maybe you're just equally as tough.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.766
I mean, would you settle
for being equally as tough?

39:54.308 --> 39:55.142
Could be, sure.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.603
(groans)

39:57.853 --> 40:00.940
Maybe even, uh, ten percent<i> less </i>tough?

40:01.023 --> 40:03.192
-Is that possible?
-Yeah.

40:04.902 --> 40:05.820
SAL: I'll tell you something.

40:06.487 --> 40:09.407
I don't want that, uh,
anybody should be just as tough.

40:10.324 --> 40:12.243
-I want us to cooperate.
-Meaning?

40:13.160 --> 40:16.664
I throw a little business your way,
I put you in the way of some real bread.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.792
Everybody prospers. Cooperation.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.794
You want us to work for you.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.798
A franchise deal, like I got
with all the other independents.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.384
Now you're gonna make
more with me in one day

40:28.676 --> 40:31.095
than you will in a week
working for yourself.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.055
(laughs) Hey, Mike...

40:33.139 --> 40:35.015
Hey... how's your head, huh?

40:35.850 --> 40:39.353
Hey, Carl... get the man some ice.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.189
No more tragic accidents either,
like Mr. Watkins, huh?

40:42.815 --> 40:45.526
What do you say? Mr. Zip-lip?

40:47.486 --> 40:48.487
Worth discussin'.

40:49.113 --> 40:49.989
SAL: Hey, Mike.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.451
Look at him. Don't be so serious.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.078
-Life's a cabaret, huh?
-Uh-huh.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.831
(laughs)

40:58.914 --> 41:01.208
(telephone ringing)

41:03.252 --> 41:07.047
Oh, Frank, tails on both Cordera
and Santiago have called in.

41:07.131 --> 41:10.009
Cordera's back at his apartment,
Santiago's at the mariachi bar.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.844
Captain, let us go back
in the neighborhood.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.471
I know we can find somebody
that's heard him speak English.

41:13.554 --> 41:14.680
I want us off him now, Luce.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.223
I want our uniforms
out of that neighborhood.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.559
-What else do we have going?
-What we were talking about.

41:18.642 --> 41:19.977
You wanted to see us, Captain?

41:23.689 --> 41:24.857
Thanks for all your attentions.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.193
-(chuckles) Good luck, Mr. Eastman.
-God bless you all.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.944
-BOBBY: All right, let's go. Natalie.
-God bless you.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.696
-RENKO: God bless you, pal.
-Usury.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.115
NATALIE: (indistinct) Let's go, you guys.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.242
-Good work, Bobby.
-Thanks, Captain.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.494
-RENKO: Move in here.
-Leo...

41:36.577 --> 41:38.454
S.I.D. have any information on Watkins?

41:38.537 --> 41:39.955
Negative. Washington called.

41:40.039 --> 41:42.249
They're at Intestinale's.
They'll be back in an hour.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.504
Congratulations, Andrew.

41:48.047 --> 41:48.881
I won.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.926
-MAN: Good work, Andy.
-Drat!

41:52.009 --> 41:54.553
Congratulations on you too,
Lieutenant. It's a tie.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.305
You and Renko run off tomorrow.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.725
Lieutenant Goldblume,
you waged a clean campaign.

41:59.808 --> 42:00.684
MAN: Nice work, nice work.

42:00.768 --> 42:01.644
-I voted for you.
-Thank you.

42:03.646 --> 42:06.690
-Way to go, man. Congratulations.
-(indistinct chatter)

42:07.816 --> 42:08.734
Oh.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.987
-Congratulations, Howard.
-Oh, thanks, Henry.

42:12.071 --> 42:14.198
I will accept provisional congratulations.

42:14.281 --> 42:15.824
Incidentally, I would
like to converse with you

42:15.908 --> 42:18.077
at your earliest convenience
concerning this runoff.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.120
Uh, dinner, perhaps. Uh, my treat?

42:20.204 --> 42:21.497
Uh, your favorite deli.

42:32.299 --> 42:35.052
(pop music playing)

42:37.304 --> 42:40.015
(indistinct chatter)

42:41.350 --> 42:42.268
Velvet.

42:50.776 --> 42:52.653
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:53.862 --> 42:54.697
Who's winning?

42:55.406 --> 42:57.992
I always beat this guy. He makes me rich.

42:58.909 --> 42:59.994
Is he bragging?

43:00.494 --> 43:01.912
-Eighty cents.
-On me.

43:04.873 --> 43:06.000
MAYO: Thank you. That's sweet.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.335
MAN: You shoot pool,<i> chica?</i>

43:08.419 --> 43:10.462
No, I don't know
how to hold the cue right.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.257
Take my turn. I'll show you how to shoot.

43:19.471 --> 43:21.265
I'll miss the ball,
I'll get you caught up.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.893
Tell him I'll catch him up.

43:25.352 --> 43:26.854
I hear you, mama. I got you.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.898
Oh, good. I didn't think you understood.

43:30.232 --> 43:31.567
SANTIAGO: I understand you, mama.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.694
He's showing you crazy.
Don't hold it like that.

43:33.777 --> 43:34.778
Come here. I'll show you.

43:38.991 --> 43:41.410
-You're busted, sucker. I'm a cop.
-(grunting)

43:41.493 --> 43:42.578
MAYO: Oh! Harry!

43:43.245 --> 43:45.789
Police! Freeze! Coffey! Pats!

43:46.248 --> 43:47.916
-Drop it!
-(gunshots)

43:49.084 --> 43:51.462
(men shouting in Spanish)

43:52.671 --> 43:55.424
(men speaking Spanish)

43:57.468 --> 43:59.553
-(grunting)
-(indistinct chatter)

43:59.637 --> 44:02.306
(sirens wailing)

44:03.390 --> 44:05.809
MAYO: He understood
and responded to my questions.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.936
He formed several sentences of his own.

44:08.103 --> 44:10.230
-No Spanish spoken?
-It was all in English.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.399
-Your exchange was witnessed?
-Yeah, by Garibaldi.

44:12.483 --> 44:15.152
And the bartender.
It was a good choice, Armando.

44:15.235 --> 44:16.820
-Is he gonna make it?
-Most of him.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.406
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Means you scored a bull's-eye, Detective.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.533
Uh, Detective Mayo, I need your piece.

44:24.453 --> 44:26.789
(siren wails)

44:26.872 --> 44:29.416
-Good work, Patsy, Harry.
-Thanks, Captain.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.252
No, it was all Pats, Captain.
She was great.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.672
You better call victims' aid.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.840
Mrs. Furillo's gonna
want to tell Mrs. Tripp

44:36.924 --> 44:38.842
-that Santiago's been arrested.
-Okay.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.513
Uh, Patsy, you better be prepared

44:42.596 --> 44:44.890
for some squad-room flack
about your marksmanship.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.601
Captain, he was moving.
I-I was aiming for his leg.

44:47.685 --> 44:48.602
Understood.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.316
I was going for the guy's leg.

44:54.858 --> 44:56.026
Sometimes you just get lucky.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.079
(telephone ringing)

45:12.835 --> 45:13.752
Furillo.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.923
Was his guard hurt?

45:22.094 --> 45:23.011
Thanks, John.

45:24.513 --> 45:26.390
-Damn it.
-What?

45:29.309 --> 45:32.312
Department was hiding a witness
till he could give grand-jury testimony.

45:32.604 --> 45:35.566
-Killed?
-Kidnapped.

45:39.778 --> 45:40.904
(sarcastically) You're shocked.

45:42.197 --> 45:44.283
I don't shock as easily as I used to.

45:48.954 --> 45:52.416
Irwin Bernstein's been offered
head of south bureau, Frank.

45:52.875 --> 45:53.751
Good for Irwin.

45:55.210 --> 45:56.420
How did you happen to hear that?

45:58.046 --> 45:59.506
He offered me his old job.

46:01.633 --> 46:04.094
-You considering it?
-Yep.

46:06.638 --> 46:08.849
For openers, it's an extra seven grand.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.520
Can't hate the 7,000.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.941
It could be a very dramatic reorientation.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.193
That has an appeal.

46:20.110 --> 46:22.571
If anything, being a P.D.
has made me believe

46:22.654 --> 46:24.406
even more strongly than when I left school

46:24.490 --> 46:29.286
that I can't pull my punches
if the process is going to work.

46:30.078 --> 46:31.497
It's upsetting to climb into the ring

46:31.580 --> 46:33.957
and realize sometimes
the energy isn't there.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.084
Maybe you ask too much of yourself.

46:37.669 --> 46:40.297
The process is too important
to shortchange that way.

46:40.881 --> 46:41.840
What about the person?

46:43.675 --> 46:44.593
(sighs)

46:45.886 --> 46:48.722
Maybe the person's been doing
the same thing for too long.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.516
Anyway...

46:51.433 --> 46:54.436
I'd like to consider
the possibility of finding out.

46:56.605 --> 46:58.732
It's like I've been using my left so long,

46:59.107 --> 47:01.485
now maybe I ought to find out
if my right's any good.

47:02.861 --> 47:04.071
I'll tell you one thing, kiddo,

47:06.698 --> 47:09.451
-your legs are still there.
-(laughing)

47:11.370 --> 47:13.288
Let's see if I've lost it in the clinches.

47:13.372 --> 47:16.083
-(groans)
-(laughs)

47:19.169 --> 47:21.004
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, yeah?

47:21.088 --> 47:24.174
-(laughs)
-JOYCE: Mm.

47:26.927 --> 47:30.097
(closing theme playing)
