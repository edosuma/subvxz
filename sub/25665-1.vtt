00:51.007 --> 00:52.443
Alex?

00:52.487 --> 00:53.923
Wake up.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.447
Fuck!

01:06.979 --> 01:11.767
Alex!

01:11.810 --> 01:13.769
Oh, no.
Hey.

01:13.812 --> 01:16.859
Alex, it's okay.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.427
It's okay. You're okay.

01:22.734 --> 01:25.259
What were you dreaming about?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.525
I don't remember.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.396
Should we pull over?

01:32.440 --> 01:34.616
No, no, I'm sorry, I'm fine.

02:05.516 --> 02:06.822
You know I actually think
this weekend's gonna be

02:06.865 --> 02:09.651
really good for us.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.305
If we survive.

02:23.055 --> 02:27.016
So, this is the ultimate
horror movie experience.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.670
It's perfect.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.803
A lot of good horror movies
start at an old gas station.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.474
-One second!
-Okay...

02:56.654 --> 02:59.353
I thought I was
the only girl.

02:59.396 --> 03:02.051
-So did I.
-Uh, you were.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.532
Uh, my buddy got me
tickets for my birthday,

03:04.575 --> 03:06.664
but he got sick
last minute and bailed.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.753
She's doing me
a huge favor.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.146
Lucky us.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.141
Oh!

03:49.185 --> 03:50.926
You know it's a party
when the most popular spot

03:50.969 --> 03:53.407
is the bathroom.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.279
You look way too smart
to be doing this.

03:56.323 --> 03:59.761
And too pretty.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.676
I'm here with my boyfriend.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.155
Hey.

04:03.199 --> 04:06.376
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I-I figured.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.510
It's, you know,
worth a shot, right?

04:09.553 --> 04:12.121
Yes.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.737
I'll be right back!

04:23.567 --> 04:24.916
Lose something?

04:24.960 --> 04:27.310
Looking for clues.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.617
And you would be wise
to do the same.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.488
Didn't you read
the directive?

04:31.532 --> 04:33.925
Yeah, Nathan.
Didn't you read the directive?

04:33.969 --> 04:36.014
I skimmed it.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.973
It's part-haunted house,
part-scavenger hunt.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.322
But we don't have
to worry about it.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.845
We're just here to have fun.

04:40.889 --> 04:44.458
Good luck with that.
We're gonna win this time.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.766
How many of these
have you guys done?

04:48.810 --> 04:50.202
This is our fourth.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.422
Reviews on Fangoria
said it's the best.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.555
It better be
for what it cost.

04:54.598 --> 04:55.947
This was expensive?

04:55.991 --> 04:58.123
I don't know. Graham paid.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.995
But don't worry about it.
The guy's loaded.

05:06.088 --> 05:09.396
Slasher Sleepout?

05:09.439 --> 05:11.049
Yeah.

05:13.443 --> 05:16.533
You can't take any of
that shit with you.
What?

05:16.577 --> 05:18.666
They said no bags.

05:18.709 --> 05:23.018
Shit. What are we gonna do?

05:23.061 --> 05:24.498
I guess we'll just rough it.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.413
I'm Larry, by the way.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.153
Marina.
Pitch.

05:28.197 --> 05:31.069
Pitch.
Like black?

05:36.945 --> 05:38.990
Molester van, 6:00.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.169
Molester. 60 seconds.

05:46.694 --> 05:50.524
Uh, uh, uh, somebody
didn't read the directive.

05:50.567 --> 05:55.964
Huh! Lookie what I found.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.532
I hope you don't need this.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.055
It's just in case.

06:00.098 --> 06:04.668
Well, I suggest you go
plug it up, Carrie.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.932
M-My name's not Carrie.All right then.

06:07.976 --> 06:11.675
The bloodier the better, right?

06:11.719 --> 06:14.548
Welcome to Slasher Sleepout.

06:14.591 --> 06:18.856
For the next 36 hours,
you'll be ruint.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.597
We'll be what?

06:20.641 --> 06:23.078
Ruined.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.341
Rule number one.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.476
For your own safety,
you must obey all instructions

06:29.519 --> 06:32.957
as if God himself
was telling you.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.438
You all need to
sign this waiver,

06:35.482 --> 06:40.487
granting us permission
to scare the piss out of you.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.272
Your experience may include,

06:43.315 --> 06:45.927
but will not be limited to,

06:45.970 --> 06:50.105
sensory deprivation,
heights,

06:50.148 --> 06:51.933
rough handling.

06:51.976 --> 06:55.980
We can touch you,
but you can't touch us.

06:56.024 --> 06:59.897
Deep water...

06:59.941 --> 07:04.946
sexual...depravity...

07:04.989 --> 07:10.081
and other extreme situations.

07:10.125 --> 07:15.913
Now everybody put your
cellphones in this bag.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.394
They'll be returned
to those of you

07:18.438 --> 07:22.746
who finish the weekend alive.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.488
We'll get those bags
back to you too.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.708
Though I, uh, can't promise

07:27.751 --> 07:31.189
that any dirty panties
won't be sniffed.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.544
If you can't take
any more abuse,

07:37.587 --> 07:39.546
there is a safe phrase.

07:39.589 --> 07:43.375
Just shout it out,
and we'll come get ya.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.509
But we get ya, that's it.

07:46.553 --> 07:51.906
No more fun,
no refunds, you're done.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.909
Got it?What's the safe phrase?

07:54.952 --> 08:00.567
Aww...You scared
already, Cupcake?

08:00.610 --> 08:04.875
Aloha, welcome to Hawaii.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.402
The directive didn't say
anything about the storyline.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.230
Yep.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.668
Are you gonna
tell us what it is?

08:14.711 --> 08:15.799
No.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.888
What do you
get if we win?

08:17.932 --> 08:19.107
Your life.

08:19.150 --> 08:22.545
Oh.

08:22.589 --> 08:23.851
Graham.

08:23.894 --> 08:26.201
He's sick, so I'm
taking his place.

08:26.244 --> 08:29.291
Okay. Well,
I got to brand you.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.293
Roll up your sleeve.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.511
Brand?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.948
Don't forget rule number one.

08:37.472 --> 08:40.432
Rule number one,
do what you're told!

08:40.476 --> 08:42.304
Now roll up your sleeve!

08:51.095 --> 08:52.314
Nathan.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.882
Yeah?

08:54.925 --> 08:59.060
Larry. Pitch.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.062
-What is it?
-My pills!

09:01.105 --> 09:03.151
Oh, shit.
Marina.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.593
Okay.

09:10.637 --> 09:14.336
You're all set.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.772
You're all set!

09:19.733 --> 09:20.864
Found them!

09:51.068 --> 09:53.070
Oh! Who's there?

09:53.114 --> 09:55.333
Alex.

09:55.377 --> 09:58.032
Are you excited
to be ruined, Alex?

09:58.075 --> 09:59.903
Not particularly.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.993
My pussy is so
fucking wet right now.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.778
You can't smell it,
can you?

10:04.821 --> 10:06.910
Umm...

10:17.617 --> 10:19.662
Hey, w-what are you doing?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.577
What is he doing?Probably looking for clues.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.623
We've been doing a lot of
zombie escape rooms lately.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.016
Anything could be
part of the game.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.583
Are there gonna be zombies?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.020
Well, probably.

10:30.064 --> 10:33.284
This looks like something.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.678
This must be
the starting point.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.725
Does this number have
any meaning to anyone?

10:38.768 --> 10:40.204
A date?

10:40.248 --> 10:43.338
March 21? Maybe?I don't think so.

10:49.213 --> 10:53.522
Uh, I don't think that
garbage is part of the game.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.045
Oh, really?

10:57.831 --> 10:59.571
There's six of these.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.052
This one's mine.

11:10.974 --> 11:14.064
Where's my bag?Get it yourself, man.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.775
Aww, aww, eww!

11:32.779 --> 11:34.084
I don't have a flashlight.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.738
Anyone else
have one of these?

11:35.782 --> 11:38.349
We each have a special item.

11:38.393 --> 11:41.004
These weren't in my bag.
I just brought them.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.312
What did you get?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.314
A condom?

11:46.357 --> 11:48.664
It'll come in handy somehow.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.884
Whoa!

11:50.927 --> 11:52.320
Jesus.

11:52.363 --> 11:55.192
-Is that thing real?
-It's really heavy.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.238
Like they would
give us a real gun.

12:02.634 --> 12:03.810
Interesting.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.463
What?

12:05.507 --> 12:08.118
Only two bullets.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.164
We're definitely
gonna need this later.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.036
Wait, what if that goes off
or something?It won't.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.517
Hey, can we like
not keep that loaded?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.171
That's stupid.

12:17.214 --> 12:21.001
We might need to
fire it off quickly.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.524
I'm sure they're just blanks.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.830
Still, if it's
part of the game,

12:23.873 --> 12:28.051
we don't want to
risk wasting them.
