00:21.063 --> 00:22.313
Greetings, Americans.

00:22.398 --> 00:25.983
Leave a message after the beep,
but not if you're going to mumble,

00:26.068 --> 00:30.071
because a voice is not just a blessing,
it's also a choice.

00:32.031 --> 00:35.576
Hey, Carol. It's Louis from Sound Mix-A-Lot.

00:35.661 --> 00:40.289
I'm just calling real quick
because Eva Longoria, the actress,

00:40.374 --> 00:44.460
she has to re-loop her lines for an entire film
where she plays a cockney mob wife.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.547
I attached the sound file for you to check out.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.257
She sounds like a retarded pirate,

00:49.341 --> 00:51.968
so the studio is paying
to have her work with a coach.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.720
And I thought of you.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.055
Sorry, I never use the word "retarded"
in a derogatory way.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.306
I hate people who do that.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.684
Sorry, if you have a cousin or a friend
who's retarded,

00:59.768 --> 01:02.520
I didn't mean it that way. So, sorry about
that.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.730
Is that what you think, you stupid slapper?

01:07.109 --> 01:09.068
Is that what you fink?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.321
I don't give a shit about what you think!

01:12.489 --> 01:14.657
Is that what you think, you stupid slapper?

01:20.080 --> 01:24.584
This Wednesday, one woman
will teach another woman

01:24.668 --> 01:27.420
to sound a little less retarded.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.131
In a world

01:30.841 --> 01:32.967
like nothing you've ever imagined.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.219
Without a single unified voice,

01:35.596 --> 01:38.848
humanity has been left searching for
answers to the unknown.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.185
Now, one man has the power
to change that.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.519
One man.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.104
Me.

01:45.189 --> 01:48.399
When the storm hit, both our cars
were totally underwater.

01:48.484 --> 01:52.361
In a world where both of our cars
were totally underwater.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.072
We thought it would take forever
to get some help.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.117
But a new wind was about to blow.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.411
There's hundreds of people
doing voice work,

02:00.496 --> 02:02.371
but only five of them
are making all the money.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.706
Yeah. That's as it should be.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.045
I'm sorry. As long as I'm one of the five,
that's as it should be.

02:10.130 --> 02:14.967
Is it true that sometimes you will do
60 promos a week, 35 in a day?

02:15.052 --> 02:17.804
Oh, yeah. That's... That's actually
not uncommon at all.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.931
That's pretty much a slow week
in many cases.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.142
Odds are you already knew the voice
of Don LaFontaine,

02:23.227 --> 02:25.061
who died in Los Angeles Tuesday.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.395
He was 68.

02:27.022 --> 02:31.108
He was the Don. He was the guy.
Nobody really could ever compare to him.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.735
When we were young, for a while,

02:32.903 --> 02:36.656
we were both referred to
as the "it boys" of the voice over world,

02:36.740 --> 02:38.324
which I thought was kind of amusing,

02:38.408 --> 02:41.410
because I never met a boy
with pipes like these.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.162
"In a world... "

02:43.247 --> 02:45.832
Those words were for Don only.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.166
- I mean...
- There's no question about that.

02:47.251 --> 02:52.171
But I think that it could safely be said
everybody wants a piece of that legacy.

02:52.256 --> 02:57.093
Meet Thomas Coyne.
He's out of cents and he's $3 short.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.427
Ever since I was a kid,

02:58.554 --> 03:04.684
I remember hearing Don coo those words,
"In a world... In a world... " You know?

03:04.893 --> 03:07.436
And when I heard that
I was like, "I want to be a part of that world.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.481
"I want to be part of that world. That world. "

03:10.607 --> 03:16.070
For whoever takes his place,
those are gigantic shoes to fill.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.490
I think Don was a... I think a size 11.

03:19.783 --> 03:24.579
It is true that I happen to be a 13.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.164
I don't know if you can see that,
but it's just the truth.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.749
Whether or not that matters,
I don't know.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.693
Why aren't the humidifiers on?

03:56.486 --> 03:57.778
I'm dead.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.572
Fuckin' Christ.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.828
Listen, did Gustav Warner happen to call?

04:06.330 --> 04:08.998
- Jesus Christ.
- He and I are getting a steam later.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.834
I'm not home.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.962
Did Gustav call?

04:15.297 --> 04:19.884
God, Dad. I don't know why you...
I can do what that guy does.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.886
What the hell does that have to do
with anything?

04:24.306 --> 04:29.518
This Wednesday, one woman will
teach another woman

04:29.686 --> 04:32.104
to sound less...

04:34.066 --> 04:38.069
This Wednesday, one woman
will teach another woman...

04:39.196 --> 04:41.113
I just woke up, so my voice is cold, but...

04:41.198 --> 04:43.699
Look, are you hungry?
Jamie worked me up an appetite.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.534
I'm gonna rustle us up some grub.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.703
Oh, my God. "Grub"?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.246
I'm gonna make breaky.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.581
"Breaky"?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.750
Jesus, what the fuck
is wrong with you, Carol?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.210
You know, I say, "Black," you say, "White. "

04:54.294 --> 04:55.753
- I'm gonna eat out here.
- You're yelling so much. Why?

04:55.837 --> 04:57.296
- You don't want to come, stay in bed.
- It's so early.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.049
Her name is Erin and her other name is Erin.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.177
So you know that mentally unstable guy
who lives in front of the Quiznos?

05:03.261 --> 05:04.261
No.

05:04.346 --> 05:08.432
You remember, he's the lunatic
who's got that crazy German brogue.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.850
You know, this is Jamie's favorite show.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.811
Actually, it's quite good.
You should check it out.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.854
I think he's from Munich or something,

05:13.939 --> 05:15.856
but I wanted to get his voice
for my archives.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.735
And he's always lecturing how the world's
real currency is lettuce,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.153
so I had to buy a head of romaine

05:21.238 --> 05:23.280
- to negotiate with him.
- I can't wait to see you, puppy.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.075
I'm gonna purr to you all night long.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.327
Voice mail, huh?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.247
- I'm sorry, sweetie. What's up?
- Nothing.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.499
Where is "the groupie" anyway?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.251
What, is she busy at a smiling convention
somewhere?

05:35.335 --> 05:38.504
Jamie is doing re-shoots
for a Ziploc commercial she got.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.298
Jesus. That girl is bad news, Dad. I mean...

05:41.383 --> 05:43.426
Honestly, she smells like Life Savers

05:43.510 --> 05:45.845
and she has
a Midwestern accent, un-ironically.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.055
Moreover, she should be paying us rent.
She's here a lot.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.224
Jamie is going to be moving in, sweetheart.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.601
You're gonna have to find
another place to live now.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.439
- What? She's 26!
- She's 30.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.607
- That's my age.
- You're 31 now.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.402
- Okay, barely.
- Look, she's an adult. That's the point.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.195
She collects rainbow magnets!

06:03.280 --> 06:04.780
- At least she likes me.
- For the wrong reasons.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.323
Well, they're right enough for me.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.701
I'm appalled, Dad. I'm appalled.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.120
Look, I'm feeling happy
for the first time in quite a while.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.372
You know what?
I think this is just a validation thing. I do.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.624
I think you should start spinning again.
I've been thinking about...

06:15.709 --> 06:17.418
Carol, I love you,
but let me tell you something.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.295
You're not gonna be able
to talk me out of this, okay?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.839
Jamie printed me out an article
from Yahoo! Health.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.051
It was all about enabling,
and I realized at that point

06:25.135 --> 06:28.304
I cannot continue to support
your emotional handicap.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.681
- I understand. Okay.
- Let me finish, okay?

06:30.974 --> 06:35.352
Sometimes, I get the feeling
I've done all I could for you, kid.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.105
I mean, I let you share my crash pad
with me for years.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.316
I shared all my contacts in the biz with you.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.487
Listen, if I could break you off a piece
of this voice and give it to you, I would.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.573
But I can't,
because that's an impossible conceit.

06:47.783 --> 06:48.824
And the truth of the matter is,

06:48.950 --> 06:51.202
it probably wouldn't help you anyway
because, let's face it,

06:51.411 --> 06:53.579
the industry does not crave a female sound.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.748
Yeah, Dad, you've made me painfully aware
of that my whole life.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.750
- I'm not being sexist, that's just the truth.
- Okay.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.377
This whole voice-cracking
problem you've grown into

07:00.462 --> 07:01.837
isn't doing you any favors either.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.590
But here's what I'm trying to say,
sweetheart. Okay?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.217
You should stick with the accents.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.761
I mean, that's your thing.
That's what you're good at.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.931
What was that great Russian Star Wars thing
you used to do as a kid?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.516
Yeah, I know the one you're talking about.
But, Dad...

07:13.600 --> 07:16.352
- What was it?
- It was... Don't make me do it.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.187
- Come on.
- I don't want to do it.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.855
Please let me hear it.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.691
Deese are not the droids
you're lookink for.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.530
I just love that. It's so random.

07:27.697 --> 07:32.785
But listen, I can't pay rent

07:32.869 --> 07:34.954
with the freelance vocal coaching.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.164
- So, why don't we think of an agreement...
- Sweetheart,

07:37.290 --> 07:39.083
not my problem. You understand?

07:39.167 --> 07:42.795
Listen, I'm gonna support you
by not supporting you.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.589
Okay, but what's the timeline on this?
Can you at least let me...

07:45.674 --> 07:47.591
- Look, there's no big hurry.
- Okay, good. Because...

07:47.676 --> 07:49.760
Tonight would be good.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.311
The search is on, my friend.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.397
What's that?

08:01.523 --> 08:03.816
There's a great big epic
coming down the pike.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.027
They wanna bring "It" back.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.948
Copy starts with the words,
"In a world... "

08:11.491 --> 08:13.826
And right now,
they're trying to find their guy.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.870
How can they do that without LaFontaine?

08:15.954 --> 08:18.455
He coined the phrase,
he's the godfather of the industry.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.667
Enough with that, please!
That Don LaFontaine stuff. All right?

08:21.751 --> 08:24.461
"Donnie was the...
Was the godfather of the industry. "

08:24.546 --> 08:26.547
"Donnie had perfect tone. "
"Donnie had a big dick. "

08:26.631 --> 08:27.840
Donnie this, Donnie that!

08:27.924 --> 08:29.967
All right, the guy was the best.
You think I don't know that?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.510
No, Sam, that's not what I meant.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.972
I know what you meant. I understand.
It's just... It's just...

08:35.557 --> 08:36.682
What is it?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.268
I'm sorry, Gustav. It's just hard.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.437
I know.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.606
I know I'm not as good as he was.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.861
You know what? You.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.155
You're their guy.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.157
- That's right.
- Sam...

08:53.325 --> 08:55.367
If they want me to do it, sure.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.494
I wrote the book. I lived that life.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.122
I'm getting a Lifetime Achievement Award
for Christ's sake.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.626
And the fact of the matter is, I could never
really do it as good as Don. No, no.

09:03.793 --> 09:07.671
It's time. It's time to pass the torch.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.548
What are you saying?

09:10.300 --> 09:14.303
I'm saying,
I'm going to go to bat for you, kid.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.517
Moe, I am simply saying
that it was on the counter this morning,

09:20.602 --> 09:22.228
and that you just must have moved it.
That's it.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.521
Honey, you've misplaced it. That's all.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.566
Okay. So, you're accusing me of losing
my wedding ring! Got it.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.486
Now see, I feel like that sounds kind
of argumentative.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.862
Moe, I'm not going to have an argument

09:31.947 --> 09:34.823
about whether we're having
a goddamn argument or not, right?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.952
That's the only kind of argument
I know how to have.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.246
- I'm coming.
- I'm somewhat practiced at it.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.747
Dad kicked me out.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.540
- Hey, Carol.
- What? What happened?

09:43.625 --> 09:46.752
- I need to wash everything I own.
- Carol, could you have called?

09:46.836 --> 09:49.546
I did, Dani, but you don't answer
your telephone.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.215
- That's not my fault.
- What happened?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.758
I'm glad I didn't throw away my lucky couch.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.886
Okay. The groupie's moving in with Dad.
Can you believe it?

09:55.971 --> 09:57.763
- She's 23.
- She's 30.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.682
Well, it's your fault for introducing them.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.059
I didn't. You always do that. No, you do.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.519
- What is in this bag?
- That was a different one.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.063
So the autobiography and winning
a Lifetime Achievement Award

10:06.147 --> 10:08.524
aren't enough? He's gotta have a concubine?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.567
Your dad is a sexy cool guy.
Give him a break.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.696
"A sexy cool guy"?
What's the matter with you?

10:26.626 --> 10:31.588
So, you can use a plane.
Then you exit to the two exit door.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.967
The door is on automatchically.

10:35.051 --> 10:39.555
The... You see the...

10:39.639 --> 10:43.642
Up the stair and the down stair.
You go to up the stair.

10:43.727 --> 10:49.690
Then little building here.
The little building, go, go walk way.

10:50.233 --> 10:55.571
You... You see the park.
The park is... Okay...

10:55.739 --> 10:57.448
What's your favorite craft?

10:57.532 --> 11:01.076
Well, I really like making pottery.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.704
- It's like... Like it's amazing...
- Like in Ghost?

11:03.788 --> 11:07.291
- Yeah, it's amazing!
- I think if you walk away, you see that.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.048
It's like if a Beanie Baby could talk.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.591
I love your gloss.

11:17.302 --> 11:21.430
Please do not accost my clientele here
with your goddamn recorders.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.683
The Eastern Europeans
are a really paranoid group already.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.102
I say that it's for "artistic research"
and they, like, love it.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.979
They don't understand that.
They think that you're a spy.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.022
- Okay?
- Excuse me.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.774
Good afternoon, Mr. Pouncer.
How can I help you?

11:32.567 --> 11:33.984
Well, there's this mate of mine, right,

11:34.069 --> 11:36.820
and he's a little under the weather
at the moment.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.781
So I want to send him this.

11:39.616 --> 11:40.657
Medicine.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.203
- Very good.
- There's his address and information.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.662
Do you think
you could do that for me, love?

11:45.747 --> 11:46.705
Absolutely. Consider it done.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.332
- Thanks a million.
- Have a lovely day.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.377
Sure, now that I've seen you,
I most definitely will.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.669
Get out of here.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.423
I'm sorry. His voice is a vision.
What could I do?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.633
Go to your meeting.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.884
For someone who works in hospitality,

11:58.968 --> 12:01.095
you're really inhospitable.
You know that, Dani?

12:01.179 --> 12:02.679
If they paid me a little more, I'd be nicer.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.765
Stop it! Don't do that! Get out!

12:04.849 --> 12:08.519
And I need to check out
other facilities but right...

12:12.023 --> 12:14.024
You gotta be kidding me.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.660
Hey, I'm here to see Louis.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.497
Hi! I'm Nancy. I'm new.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.376
- Have a seat. I'll let Louis know you're here.
- Okay.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.593
You're Sam Sotto's kid, right?

12:41.845 --> 12:43.846
Yeah, how'd you know?

12:43.972 --> 12:46.682
Your dad is so hot.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.726
Sorry. I just bought his autobiography.

12:49.811 --> 12:53.856
I love to read. So, I'm like always reading.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.358
It's important.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.278
Very cool. Cool.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.781
Sotto Jr. 's here.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.992
It's just Solomon.

13:05.076 --> 13:09.371
It's Carol Solomon,
"Sotto" is my dad's stage name.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.791
Guess you didn't get to that part in
the book.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.585
Carol.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.005
- Hey.
- What up, playa?

13:18.214 --> 13:20.966
All right. Come on.
Let's make something shiny out of shit!

13:21.050 --> 13:23.302
- Great.
- All right.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.263
Hey, so, really sorry about that stupid
rambling message

13:26.347 --> 13:27.639
I left on your machine the other day

13:27.724 --> 13:28.974
when I said "retarded" a bunch of times.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.392
I didn't mean actually retarded.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.146
I think I just get nervous or something when
I'm leaving a message on your machine.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.230
Your dad might hear it

13:35.315 --> 13:37.733
and I'm doing a voice over
basically on your phone.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.776
You don't have to worry
about it anymore 'cause I moved out.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.737
So you can just call me on my cell directly.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.821
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.491
Oh, cool. Definitely.
I'll definitely call you on your cell, you know.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.202
If the situation calls for it, professionally,
I'll call you on the cell.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.579
- I'm not gonna bum rush you or anything.
- Okay.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.372
I should cut you with a knife, I should.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.500
Is that what you think?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.418
Is that what you think, you stupid slapper?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.380
Just remember the "F" for the "T-H."

14:00.757 --> 14:04.218
Like "F" for "fink," "fink,"
versus, like, "think. "

14:04.302 --> 14:06.345
- What do you fink, you stupid...
- Yeah.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.931
- Say it, say it.
- Is zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.807
Is zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

14:10.892 --> 14:11.892
Yeah. There it is.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.143
Is zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.770
- Should we try one?
- Okay. Yeah.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.355
Okay. I'll do a series and we'll keep it open.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.440
Is zat whot you fink, you stupid slappa?

14:19.901 --> 14:21.527
- Nice work.
- Guess who's a no show!

14:21.694 --> 14:23.445
Gustav Jizz Nuggets.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.447
Hey. I'm in a session, Heners. Come on.

14:25.907 --> 14:29.159
Louis, I gotta turn this temp track in today.
I was gonna do it myself, but...

14:29.244 --> 14:33.247
No, no, no! You sound like an angry Muppet.
Get Cher. It'll be better.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.666
Cher sounds like a sleepy chipmunk.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.793
I can do it. I mean, I'll do it.

14:37.919 --> 14:41.421
I'm no Don LaFontaine,
but if it's just a temp recording, I can do it.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.798
No, that'd be perfect.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.007
I needed to do this 10 minutes ago.
Thank you.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.135
Eva, could you just put the cork back
in your mouth and work on those vowels?

14:47.262 --> 14:50.722
- Thank you.
- A-E-I-O-U, A-E-I-O-U...

14:51.724 --> 14:53.392
So, princess boy will not be gracing us

14:53.518 --> 14:57.062
with his shitty vocals
for this piece of dung trailer

14:57.146 --> 14:59.648
for a fucking romantic comedy with children.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.316
This is for Welcome to the Jungle Gym.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.985
Hey, Gustav's sound is tight.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.070
Do not judge him
for being monetarily privileged.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.072
- Carol, you want a water or a Fanta?
- I'd like a Fanta.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.658
I'm sorry, I have no time for a rich kid

15:09.742 --> 15:12.119
who threw away his inheritance
on a soccer team

15:12.203 --> 15:14.496
and then somehow fell into being
the highest paid voice over artist...

15:14.622 --> 15:16.081
Okay, Carol, why don't you
just hop in the booth.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.874
He's lucky he's got those pipes,

15:17.959 --> 15:19.918
otherwise he'd be a washed-up
mortgage trader right now.

15:20.003 --> 15:23.088
Thanks for asking me
if I wanted a Fanta, Louis.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.715
Do you want a Fanta?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.216
No.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.719
Here we go. Here we go.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.345
Carol, can you hear me in there?

15:30.513 --> 15:31.680
Yeah, I hear you perfect.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.901
Ready, ready.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.696
Okay. Welcome to the Jungle Gym promo,
take one.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.787
Allo Carol!

15:55.872 --> 15:57.956
- Eva Longoria.
- Allo.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.291
Where'd you go? You just ran off.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.127
Oh, sorry. I thought we were done.
You said we were done, right?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.714
Yeah, yeah. We're done.
But you forgot your Fanta.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.425
Thanks. Back to stupid slappers.

16:08.843 --> 16:09.801
Stupid slappa!

16:09.886 --> 16:10.927
Yes, very good. You lead.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.889
Stupid slappa!
That's what you fink, you stupid slappa!

16:13.973 --> 16:15.182
- You want some Fanta?
- No.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.772
It's in the fridge, Moe.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.899
It's not. Otherwise, I'd have it.
And you'd have it.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.193
- We'd all have it. It would be great.
- Let me just do it.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.154
It's not a matter of you doing it, okay?
We're out of soy vanilla.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.822
You guys are so loud.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.574
Weren't you supposed to be in charge
of that?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.035
Well, I will be from now on. Okay?

16:35.912 --> 16:36.953
Love you!

16:37.038 --> 16:39.373
"I love you, too, Moe. Have a great day. "

16:39.624 --> 16:41.249
"You, too. Thank you, sweetness. "

16:43.002 --> 16:45.337
- Obviously, butter side down.
- Oh, no.

16:47.465 --> 16:52.052
- It's okay.
- Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Let's live.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.858
You're killing me, Dani.

17:08.903 --> 17:14.991
Mr. Pouncer, hi. I'm so sorry.
I just didn't see you there. I'm so sorry.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.118
How can I help you today, sir?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.162
I just noticed you're not wearing
a wedding ring.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.455
So now I'm never gonna leave you alone,
am I?

17:22.165 --> 17:23.834
- Sir...
- No, I'm not a sir.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.752
No, you have to do something brave

17:25.877 --> 17:28.338
or do a shit ton of drugs in a rock band
to be one of those. No, no, no.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.840
I am a Terry, however.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.137
- Terry.
- Terry. Hi.

17:35.513 --> 17:39.975
Hi, Terry.
Can I get you anything today, Terry?

17:40.059 --> 17:43.645
No, actually. I just wanted to see if I
could get you to call me Terry.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.814
And I just did.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.024
That's what me mother calls me, you see.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.401
Cheers!

17:49.610 --> 17:51.653
Cheers. Cheers.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.950
Relax, Dani, you're acting like
I'm the first guy to ever hit on you.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.626
Good afternoon, Concierge.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.044
Yes, good afternoon.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.338
Carol, I can't talk right now. I'm super busy.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.758
No, you're not.
I'm standing right behind you.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.427
- Just kidding. Psych.
- That's not funny, Carol.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.762
What?

18:16.846 --> 18:22.225
Do you know that your neighbor Pippa
is from Guildford?

18:22.310 --> 18:24.603
And I had a really nice chat with her...

18:24.687 --> 18:27.355
Because you are all out of soya vanilla.
They say "soya. "

18:27.440 --> 18:30.233
What's up, Carol?
What do you want? I got a lot of things to do.

18:30.318 --> 18:33.278
All right. Fine, fine.
I'm gonna try the soft sell on this,

18:33.362 --> 18:35.864
but you know that's really, really hard for me.

18:36.157 --> 18:40.410
Sister code, Dani.
I really need that Pouncer guy,

18:40.495 --> 18:42.162
the Irish good-looking guy.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.080
I need his accent for my archives

18:44.165 --> 18:46.708
because, really, it's one of the accents
that I struggle with.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.252
- Really, Dani.
- No, no. No, Carol.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.171
The news clips that I have,
they're too regional.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.381
And in order to really master a dialect,

18:53.466 --> 18:56.384
you need to have these vowels.
Dani, come on!

18:56.469 --> 18:58.887
- Fine.
- You're just... Did you say fine?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.055
Yeah.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.139
Great!

19:01.224 --> 19:04.226
Oh, so, there's one issue, though.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.393
What?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.979
Your manager has, like,
a fake restraining order on me or something

19:08.064 --> 19:11.149
because the Bulgarian guy that I followed
out last time happened to be a diplomat.

19:11.234 --> 19:14.110
I didn't know about it.
It was a thing... Wouldn't have done it.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.737
God damn it, Carol!

19:15.905 --> 19:16.905
Hindsight was 20-20.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.533
What? What do you want?
What do you need?

19:19.617 --> 19:22.869
Okay. So sister code. It's super easy.
All you have to do is...

19:22.954 --> 19:24.830
I'm gonna drop off
my little interview questions

19:24.914 --> 19:26.706
and the recorder
and you just press "Record. "

19:26.791 --> 19:29.876
Ask the questions. The guy answers it. Done.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.963
Sister code. Done deal. Sister code.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.757
What is this "sister code" thing
that you're doing right now?

19:35.883 --> 19:36.925
What? Sister code?

19:37.260 --> 19:38.426
"What? Sister code?"

19:38.511 --> 19:40.136
Yeah, it's a new thing. I was just trying it out.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.513
Do you like it?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.223
I don't know. I don't really like it.

19:43.307 --> 19:47.686
What? Ping-pong it a little bit.
Like I say, "Sister," you say...

19:48.020 --> 19:49.271
I'm not saying it.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.356
I won't push my luck.
But you'll do the interview questions?

19:51.566 --> 19:53.608
Look, I'm going to do it. Okay?
I'm doing it.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.943
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.987
I love you. Sister code.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.154
No.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.614
Okay. Bye.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.451
How did Mission Ireland go?

20:03.870 --> 20:04.911
Yeah. Really good.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.914
I'm gonna drop off the equipment now.
I can't believe she said yes.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.166
Yeah, me neither.
She could lose herjob if she's caught.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.793
Oh, my God, you're so dramatic.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.337
Yello.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.506
- You booked that gig!
- What gig?

20:16.591 --> 20:17.799
Welcome to the Jungle Gym.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.050
Who did?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.219
You did! The studio heard
the temp recording you did

20:21.304 --> 20:24.180
and they want your voice
on the trailer, Carol.

20:24.432 --> 20:25.557
But I'm a chick.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.017
Yeah, I know. I'm acutely aware of that.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.478
The studio said they feel that
it's a "modern, quirky" choice.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.606
- A what?
- And that you're perfect for the genre.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.482
Children's romantic comedy is a genre now?

20:34.609 --> 20:38.737
Who cares? You just took a job,
a huge job from Gustav Warner.

20:38.821 --> 20:39.821
I did?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.823
Yeah. You just served up a can
of warning soup

20:41.908 --> 20:43.867
to the Warn-dog himself!

20:46.162 --> 20:48.496
I say next up, lemon drop shots on me.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.166
Are you excited or trying to fart?

20:51.834 --> 20:54.794
Hello? Carol?

20:56.255 --> 20:59.215
Okay. All right. All right, then.
All right, let's get those shots.

20:59.300 --> 21:03.219
All right, okay. I'll see you tonight then.
All right. Okay.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.055
I know she hung up already.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.058
It's that obvious?

21:15.900 --> 21:18.234
- Hello?
- Dad, I...

21:18.361 --> 21:20.570
- Hello?
- Can you hear me?

21:20.655 --> 21:23.073
- What's that?
- Sorry. Wait. Can you hear me now?

21:23.741 --> 21:24.741
Gotcha!

21:24.825 --> 21:28.119
This is my voice mail message.
I'm unable to take your call...

21:28.204 --> 21:29.245
Really?

21:29.330 --> 21:30.455
What?

21:30.665 --> 21:33.500
I lost it to a broad? Are you kidding me?

21:33.668 --> 21:35.460
No, why would I be kidding you?

21:35.544 --> 21:38.713
You know this is all happening because
I got sick and I couldn't perform that day.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.839
Put it down.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.218
Siegel. I smell legal. I smell legal!

21:44.303 --> 21:47.055
Well, get off the phone with me
and get on the phone with them!

21:47.890 --> 21:49.391
I'm sorry, Sam.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.185
- I'm sorry you had to hear that.
- No, no, no! Listen, don't apologize.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.980
It's fine. Times are changing.
That's the way it is.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.899
Nowadays, they're flying planes,
they're taking jobs.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.360
- That's just the reality.
- Welcome to today's world.

22:00.444 --> 22:04.114
I mean, it wasn't too long ago that I can
remember, all I had to worry about

22:04.198 --> 22:07.325
with the ladies was how quickly to get their
panties off. You understand?

22:07.410 --> 22:09.411
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And I don't want you to fret.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.998
As soon as you get to resurrect
those three little words, buddy,

22:13.332 --> 22:15.250
you are gonna own this town.

22:16.377 --> 22:19.754
Amen to that. Amen to that, Sam.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.514
Hi, Moe!

22:29.598 --> 22:30.890
Pippa! Hey!

22:30.975 --> 22:32.100
Is Dani here?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.102
No, actually. No, she's at work.

22:34.395 --> 22:38.189
Look, I'm really sorry. I know I do this
all the time. It's just one tiny...

22:38.274 --> 22:39.357
No, no, no. Go ahead.

22:39.442 --> 22:42.444
Please, I'm taking a break from work.
Making a PB & J.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.071
- Peanut butter and jelly.
- Jam.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.782
"Jam. " Right, right.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.453
This is really awkward, Moe, but the thing is,
our drain's busted in our flat.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.789
My mate is dealing with it at the moment.
But the pipes need cleaning. Who knew?

22:54.957 --> 22:57.959
And I haven't showered in three days.
And I stink. It's disgusting.

22:58.085 --> 23:01.963
Oh, right! God, I've been
in my sweat pants for, like, years.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.424
I was just wondering
if I could use your shower.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.925
Yours and Dani's shower.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.307
That's weird, isn't it? I'm sorry.

23:12.391 --> 23:17.312
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
Yes! I think that'll be totally fine.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.774
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Of course. Yes.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.902
I'll be back in a jiff. Okay!

23:24.070 --> 23:25.361
All right.

23:30.451 --> 23:34.662
It's not a big deal.

23:38.459 --> 23:39.501
Hey.

23:39.627 --> 23:43.588
Hey. I was just trying to see
if you're coming home for dinner,

23:43.672 --> 23:47.050
because I was... I was cooking a...

23:47.676 --> 23:48.885
What?

23:49.011 --> 23:50.595
I was cooking a sandwich bar.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.347
A sandwich bar?

23:52.431 --> 23:55.934
Yep. For dinner. I was cooking
a sandwich bar. You know.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.395
Cold cuts and rolls and mustards.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.940
No. I think I gotta stay.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.193
They want me to help out
with some corporate thing tonight.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.904
Oh, great! I mean, whatever. No.

24:07.988 --> 24:11.199
We'll just do a sandwich bar
another night. I mean, it's so easy.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.867
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.838
Hello, shower friend!

24:24.922 --> 24:27.173
Hello! I'm shower ready!

24:27.550 --> 24:30.510
It's right over there. In the bathroom.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.761
Thank you.

24:31.846 --> 24:32.887
No, thank you.

24:33.514 --> 24:34.597
What?

24:35.224 --> 24:37.142
Do you need help with anything?

24:37.518 --> 24:39.519
No. I'm good. I've got it from here.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.648
There's a tricky hot-and-cold ratio thing.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.318
So if you get into a jam.
If you get into a "jam,"

24:47.403 --> 24:50.488
just holler, or, you know.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.159
- Hey!
- Hi!

24:54.243 --> 24:55.285
Are you okay?

24:55.369 --> 24:56.369
Pippa's naked in the shower.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.996
- Who?
- Pippa.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.456
- Why?
- Her pipes need cleaning.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.458
You look like you swallowed a frog.
What's wrong with you?

25:02.543 --> 25:03.918
What is this? PB & J? Nice.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.753
Yeah. It's peanut butter and jam.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.338
Dani's not coming home for dinner,
so I thought...

25:07.423 --> 25:10.091
Who cares? I just texted her that she doesn't
have to do Mission Ireland

25:10.176 --> 25:12.886
because the vocal coaching
is temporarily on hiatus.

25:12.970 --> 25:13.970
Why?

25:14.054 --> 25:16.681
Oh, because I just got offered another
children's movie trailer

25:16.765 --> 25:20.101
and I just came from an audition
where I might be the voice of Sunny Delight!

25:20.186 --> 25:25.231
Dude! Wow!
You're cleaning up is what, sister!

25:25.357 --> 25:27.442
Wow! Did you tell your dad?

25:27.526 --> 25:30.653
No, but I will.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.447
- Sunny D!
- Yeah.

26:20.204 --> 26:24.415
You're always taking care of me,
so I am thrilled to be able to return the favor.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.252
Well, it is my job to get you what you want.

26:27.461 --> 26:31.506
Darling, you don't get me what I want,
you get me what I ask for.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.883
I'm sure what I want would make you blush.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.138
Really? You're funny.

26:39.223 --> 26:40.765
That's funny. Okay.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.434
Setting it out right here.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.520
One-two, one-two.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.063
I think it's working.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.065
Okay, sorry, first question.

26:49.650 --> 26:53.027
What makes you laugh?
That's an odd question.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.780
Sorry. My sister's strange.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.784
I'm definitely going.
Mimi and I need to have post-party sex.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.077
Come on. Are you serious?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.955
You hate Gustav,
why would you go to his party?

27:04.039 --> 27:05.540
A few more like that, Carlos.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.875
Rape him for his open bar, idiot.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.128
Yeah, I have enough beer at home, thanks.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.629
Besides, I don't have a date.

27:11.714 --> 27:14.007
You don't have a date.
You're not supposed to go with a date.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.591
You're supposed to leave with a date.

27:15.676 --> 27:18.469
- That's the point. What is this, the '50s?
- Okay.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.722
Well, I feel safer with the buddy system.

27:20.806 --> 27:24.726
Don't act like those parties aren't the worst.
A voice over party?

27:24.810 --> 27:28.146
I'm tired of waiting for the bathroom
and hearing the voice of Cialis

27:28.230 --> 27:30.606
hitting on the
Virgin America message-hold girl.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.650
I'm not going to beg you to go, man.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.402
Ask Carol.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.611
What?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.363
You should ask Carol to the party.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.698
Really?

27:38.907 --> 27:40.616
- Yeah.
- Wow, okay.

27:40.743 --> 27:44.579
I think that's probably the single worst idea
you ever had, Cher. Nice one.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.540
- Hello.
- Hey. You busy?

27:47.624 --> 27:50.418
- No, I'm just leaving this audition thing.
- CooI, cooI.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.628
Hey, so listen,
I was calling 'cause I was just wondering

27:52.755 --> 27:55.548
if you had any plans for tonight.

27:59.762 --> 28:03.556
For like... Like to just... For what?

28:03.682 --> 28:06.517
There's this thing, just this party thing.

28:06.602 --> 28:11.397
- Oh, what, the Gustav party?
- Yeah, totally lame, right?

28:11.565 --> 28:13.191
I'm obviously not going...

28:13.275 --> 28:18.488
- I'm actually going.
- I mean, I might go, but I don't wanna go.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.033
So are you going with anyone?

28:22.117 --> 28:25.536
Yeah. My dad's girlfriend
wants me and my sister to go to it,

28:25.746 --> 28:28.456
like, as a bonding thing or something.
It's gonna be whack.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.667
Totally whack! Wickedy whack, baby!
You know what I'm talking about?

28:31.752 --> 28:33.669
That's probably why I'm not going, actually.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.339
Honestly, the only reason why
I'm going is just to network.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.467
Cool. I mean, I think that's a smart move.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.512
If I were in your situation,
I would definitely do that. Nice.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.681
- It would be more fun if you were there.
- I'm gonna get this call.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.141
- What?
- Didn't you hear what I said?

28:47.226 --> 28:48.810
- No, what did you say?
- Excuse me?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.645
No, I was just... Hello?

28:50.729 --> 28:53.064
- Please take your other call.
- Okay. Later.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.732
Do you know where I can get a smoothie
around here?

28:54.817 --> 28:57.652
I'm sorry. I do not...

28:57.736 --> 28:59.237
I'm sorry. I didn't hear what you said.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.697
I said I don't know where you'd get
a smoothie around here at all.

29:01.782 --> 29:02.824
I'm so sorry.

29:02.908 --> 29:03.908
Oh, okay. Thanks so much.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.076
Yeah. No worries.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.372
Have you seen my stress ball?
What is your problem?

29:09.456 --> 29:10.665
Carol's going to the party tonight.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.291
- With you?
- No.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.668
Are you gonna ask her?

29:13.752 --> 29:14.836
I just told her I'm not going.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.087
Why would you do that?

29:16.213 --> 29:17.296
I don't know, Cher!

29:17.381 --> 29:19.173
How you going to eat the apple
if you got no teeth?

29:19.758 --> 29:20.842
What?

29:21.009 --> 29:23.678
She's saying stop being a pussy
and bring Nancy as your date tonight

29:23.762 --> 29:24.887
to make Carol jealous.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.181
Thank you, Carlos. I don't think
she used the word "pussy," though.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.643
Was someone looking
for a date to Gustav's party?

29:30.811 --> 29:33.855
I will totally look hot for you.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.149
You'll shit when you see what I'm wearing.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.236
Please, I'll be super classy.

29:40.487 --> 29:43.197
This is cute. Right?

29:43.615 --> 29:44.740
This works.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.743
Yeah. Yeah. Is the party in 1989?

29:47.828 --> 29:50.329
Do you have a cocktail dress
that I can borrow?

29:50.789 --> 29:53.374
- Yes, I do, but I'm wearing it tonight.
- For what?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.168
- For date night.
- What?

29:55.377 --> 29:57.378
No, Dani's coming with me tonight.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.756
What? So I'm the third wheel on a dad date.

30:00.841 --> 30:01.841
Sorry.

30:01.925 --> 30:02.925
The horror.

30:03.010 --> 30:06.554
She woke up all warm and fuzzy this morning
and suggested we have a fancy dinner.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.598
Maybe she's happier
'cause you're here.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.558
No, it's definitely not that.

30:11.810 --> 30:16.814
Hey, Pippa is like,
you know, a fashiony-type person.

30:16.899 --> 30:18.608
- Yeah?
- You can borrow something from her.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.486
I mean, she owes me one
for letting her shower here.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.906
What an excellent and awkward idea.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.658
- Hi.
- Allo.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.827
- Hello there.
- How are you?

30:29.912 --> 30:31.078
Hey. Hi.

30:31.580 --> 30:34.916
Listen, we have a fashion emergency

30:35.000 --> 30:38.836
and we would like your help, my lady.

30:38.921 --> 30:43.007
A fashion emergency.
Yes, absolutely. I can help you.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.301
I never would have expected
that coming from you.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.802
- It's for... Yes.
- You.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.262
That's a lot easier.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.933
No, no, no. Sorry. That was not clear.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.059
I'm good.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.269
Absolutely. I can totally help you.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.605
Great. Chim-chimeree.

31:00.776 --> 31:03.778
Any more primping,
the girls are gonna cry with jealousy.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.405
Well, then you're just gonna have to kiss
this lipstick off me.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.115
If you insist, I guess.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.205
Hey, honey. I'm really touched
you took my advice

31:14.289 --> 31:15.831
to include the girls tonight.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.376
I can't say no to you, can I?

31:18.919 --> 31:19.919
Nope.

31:27.970 --> 31:32.223
Whoa! You look like somebody else.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.225
Are you serious? Thanks.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.103
All right. Where's Dani?

31:37.396 --> 31:38.563
Late. What else is new?

31:38.814 --> 31:40.815
Well, use protection, okay?

31:40.899 --> 31:41.899
I will.

31:42.943 --> 31:45.570
I have my diaphragm in.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.035
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.749
This chair, it always sticks like that.

31:58.834 --> 31:59.875
Can you get in there?

31:59.960 --> 32:02.795
Watch the leather.
Just be a little graceful, okay?

32:02.879 --> 32:03.879
- Sorry.
- Where's Dani?

32:03.964 --> 32:05.172
She's not coming.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.882
You look nice, Carol.

32:06.967 --> 32:07.925
Thank you.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.093
She didn't say anything to me about it.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.511
Well, she has work.

32:10.637 --> 32:14.515
Of course, I told you, remember?
I said exactly this would happen.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.058
- Would you like a Life Saver?
- It's just predictable.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.936
It's tiresome.
It's predictable, the same thing all the time.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.905
It's a lot stuffier than I remember.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.116
Yeah, Gustav,
you got enough goddamn flowers?

32:32.200 --> 32:34.744
Maybe he's covering the fact that he stinks.

32:34.828 --> 32:35.953
Nice one, Meems.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.413
Where is he, anyway?

32:37.497 --> 32:39.915
Why are we talking about him
like we're in West Egg?

32:40.959 --> 32:43.044
Oh, there he is. Mr. Big Pants.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.925
Watch the door.
I just had it detailed. Watch the door.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.178
- I'm trying my best. I'm fine.
- Watch your foot... Okay.

32:54.348 --> 32:57.058
Dad? You know what, I'm just going to make
a phone call really quickly.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.934
What phone call? We just got here.

32:59.019 --> 32:59.977
It's going to be really quick...

33:00.062 --> 33:01.979
Carol, you always do this. Come on.

33:02.064 --> 33:03.939
Listen, make sure you find us
when you're done.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.608
- All right?
- I will. I will.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.947
Hello. Yes, I'd like a cab to Reseda.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.325
How long is the wait on that ish?

33:14.409 --> 33:17.495
- Carol, hey. How are you?
- Louis.

33:17.579 --> 33:20.456
- Hi.
- Nancy is who I am.

33:20.540 --> 33:21.957
Yes. This is true.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.959
You look great.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.503
Thank you so much.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.673
Were you waiting for someone?
Or should we go in?

33:28.757 --> 33:30.132
I'm just here with my dad.

33:30.217 --> 33:33.219
- Oh, really! Let's go in.
- Yeah.

33:36.098 --> 33:39.183
I was doing a gig, and we were like
on the 22nd take,

33:39.267 --> 33:42.353
and so the producer says,
"On the next take

33:42.437 --> 33:44.355
"can you give me a little bit more energy?"

33:44.439 --> 33:46.982
And I said,
"Well, why don't you go back to take one. "

33:49.069 --> 33:50.986
You decided to come.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.988
Oh, yeah. Nancy wanted to come.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.990
I thought, you know,
"Maybe I'll run into a friend. "

33:55.075 --> 33:58.035
This place is rich. Drinks stat.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.037
- You want to come?
- No. I'm good.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.163
Are you sure?

34:01.248 --> 34:03.958
Yeah. You go and get your drink on.

34:04.042 --> 34:09.964
Used to be Don, Hal Douglas and Sam here
who had the lockdown on the epics.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.800
Sam, you weren't doing epics
until Don passed.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.969
I mean, no disrespect.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.219
None taken.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.181
By the way, how's the Just for Men
working out for you?

34:19.725 --> 34:23.936
Sam, by the way, congratulations
on the Lifetime Achievement Award.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.021
That was very, very well-deserved, my friend.

34:26.106 --> 34:27.565
Very kind of you,
I appreciate that.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.983
It is such an honor.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.819
It'll be a great way to get Sam's
whole family together.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.821
Bittersweet, though, isn't it, Sotto?

34:33.989 --> 34:38.451
I mean, you reach the peak of your success,
and you only have one way to fall.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.579
Listen, you're just on edge, Graue,
because you're getting old

34:41.663 --> 34:44.290
and Gustav's closing in
on that "In a world... " gig.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.041
- Well, let's hope so.
- I'm not sure about that.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.002
I think that they're gonna
make you fight for it.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.295
I'm surprised they didn't go to you
on this one, Sam.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.507
Well, gee, Marc, what makes you so sure
they didn't?

35:14.780 --> 35:18.199
Wow. That is not feminine.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.290
Gym bag.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.168
That's your spot. Always has been.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.549
- Pretty cool, right?
- Yeah, it's impressive.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.093
What part? The map? Or the world?

35:38.178 --> 35:40.095
You know, both are good.

35:40.180 --> 35:43.224
That's correct. Both are good.
Gustav Warner.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.059
Yeah, I know. I know. This is your...

35:45.143 --> 35:46.143
My house and my party.

35:46.228 --> 35:48.896
I don't know who you are.
Would you care to indulge me?

35:48.980 --> 35:51.440
- I'm Carol Solomon.
- Carol Solomon. You're very pretty.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.317
What?

35:53.401 --> 35:55.653
You're very pretty. You're really, really pretty.

35:55.779 --> 35:59.740
I saw you come in with some randoms
and I've been clocking you out all night.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.577
You're just really pretty.
I just wanted to tell you that.

36:03.787 --> 36:04.995
Thank you.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.914
You don't have to return the compliment.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.791
I get it. I have a face for radio.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.544
But enjoy the map. Or the world.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.842
- Mimi?
- Alla?

36:17.926 --> 36:21.345
What are you doing here?
- My god, what are you doing here?

36:21.429 --> 36:24.473
I am working here dummy.
- So, is he a good boss?

36:24.599 --> 36:29.770
He can be a shit, but he overpays me
so who gives a fuck!

36:31.231 --> 36:32.481
Jesus.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.154
Bye!

36:40.282 --> 36:41.532
Amazing, right?

36:41.616 --> 36:44.618
You got to take that thing out of here
before she strains her milk.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.963
Oh, no! Oh, sorry!

37:07.601 --> 37:09.143
Could I just have a water?

37:10.270 --> 37:13.439
It's me again. Same message.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.331
Let's see what you got, mate.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.677
Just people who have a flustered vendetta
for the unavoidable.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.470
And you, actually.

39:09.431 --> 39:13.892
Yes! You make me laugh.
Just looking at you.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.353
I'm sure you're a strong woman.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.397
And you're a toughie with your friends.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.441
But I'm looking at you now,

39:21.401 --> 39:24.069
and you're shakin' in your knickers
like a little girl.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.365
I just wish I could do something
to make you feel more comfortable.

39:29.367 --> 39:35.122
I'm fine. I'm not shaking in anything.
So comfortable.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.166
Do you have a boyfriend?

39:39.419 --> 39:41.003
No.

40:07.447 --> 40:08.655
Hello, nosy.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.782
Hey! God!

40:11.826 --> 40:13.911
I'm sorry. I'm in this...

40:14.496 --> 40:19.249
I'm really sorry about being here.
This is clearly off-limits to guests.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.044
Oh, no, no.
All of my guests have left at this point.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.253
They have?

40:23.338 --> 40:26.006
So either you're an intruder,
a figment of my imagination

40:26.091 --> 40:27.382
or you're my new roommate.

40:27.467 --> 40:30.302
I would be your roommate
if I could live in this room.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.387
This is really... This is cool.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.640
I built this special room for me.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.600
This is my private space.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.393
Oh, sorry.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.562
- I'm glad you like it.
- I like it.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.774
My parents died when I was very young,

40:45.443 --> 40:47.444
and they left me a large inheritance

40:47.529 --> 40:50.697
and I used that to travel the world,
so I never went to college.

40:51.866 --> 40:58.288
I guess you can say that
culture was my education.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.167
But now,

41:02.502 --> 41:06.255
whenever I find myself
wrapped up in the industry,

41:06.548 --> 41:08.423
I know this sounds crazy,

41:08.508 --> 41:12.511
but I like to come to this room,
take off all my clothes,

41:13.555 --> 41:18.517
and just remember what it feels like
to be uncomfortable.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.188
I'm only telling you this because
there's something about you

41:23.273 --> 41:24.481
that reminds me of me.

41:27.694 --> 41:28.694
You know?

41:28.778 --> 41:30.487
I'm sorry, I don't mean to unload
all of that on you.

41:30.572 --> 41:33.490
It's just that I look at you in this space
and you're so pretty.

41:36.202 --> 41:39.163
And I just want to kiss you right now.

42:07.609 --> 42:10.485
Sweetie, I am so sorry

42:10.570 --> 42:13.488
that our entire date night got totally
screwed up.

42:13.990 --> 42:17.451
Lizzie's nephew had some kind
of procedure or something.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.494
I don't know. He's like a kid to her.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.496
So she wanted me to cover for her
'cause her sister,

42:21.581 --> 42:26.001
whatever, is like, in AA,
or she now is in AA,

42:26.377 --> 42:28.378
and everybody's trying to clean up
over there.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.838
And she had to take care of him.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.257
I guess we could just go get Greek food
if you want.

42:32.342 --> 42:34.343
Get takeout because they're gonna...

42:34.469 --> 42:35.510
But I'm looking at you now,

42:35.595 --> 42:38.639
and you're shakin' in your knickers
like a little girl.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.573
I found it behind the sink.

42:58.618 --> 43:14.675
Wait.

44:36.049 --> 44:37.049
Hey.

44:46.768 --> 44:49.686
It's a nice day, huh?

44:53.691 --> 44:54.775
Thank you.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.153
It was really...

45:00.698 --> 45:01.698
Nice.

45:02.784 --> 45:05.702
Oh, my God!

45:05.787 --> 45:09.373
Did we sleep together?

45:09.457 --> 45:10.457
No.

45:12.585 --> 45:14.044
Did I sleep with anyone?

45:14.128 --> 45:15.128
Nope.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.005
Who did you sleep with?

45:17.507 --> 45:18.507
Nobody.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.386
Hello, Bell Cab.

45:22.470 --> 45:23.887
- Yeah, hi, can I get a taxi cab...
- Please hold.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.013
Yeah, I'll hold.

45:25.807 --> 45:28.225
I'm just going to use your bathroom.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.730
Sorry about your sheets.

45:35.733 --> 45:39.027
Guess who's a slutty whore?

45:39.445 --> 45:41.196
Dani?

45:43.783 --> 45:47.160
Danielle? What's going on?
Are you okay?

45:47.745 --> 45:49.830
What's wrong?

45:54.669 --> 45:55.836
Okay.

45:56.838 --> 45:58.922
So where were you last night, man?
I didn't see you.

45:59.006 --> 46:02.259
No, I was talking to some redhead
with a shitty voice but a killer rack.

46:02.468 --> 46:04.344
I know who you're talking about.

46:04.846 --> 46:06.513
Yeah, so, what's the word, chief?

46:06.681 --> 46:08.223
Listen, I got a little gossip for you.

46:08.307 --> 46:10.142
I found out the name of the broad
who snagged that gig.

46:10.226 --> 46:11.226
Spill it.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.311
Forget it. She's a nobody.
She's a two-bit vocal coach.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.522
But now, she booked two more
movie trailer gigs.

46:15.648 --> 46:17.816
Get this.
They're all children's movies, but still.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.734
Her name's Carol Solomon.

46:19.819 --> 46:20.819
What?

46:20.903 --> 46:23.738
Carol Solomon.
She's not gonna keep working,

46:23.823 --> 46:25.740
if I have anything to do with it. Little thief!

46:25.825 --> 46:27.075
She was at the party.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.202
What're you talking about?
Who fucking brought her?

46:29.662 --> 46:30.662
I don't know.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.748
He came in
and he walked up with this puppy.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.293
He gave Erin a puppy?
What kind of puppy?

46:36.377 --> 46:38.587
I didn't even sleep with
the stupid Irish schmuck.

46:38.754 --> 46:39.754
Are you serious?

46:39.839 --> 46:42.174
- Not that it matters. It doesn't matter.
- It does matter, Dani.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.968
That makes it... It's a gray area,
but I think that makes it a lot less...

46:45.344 --> 46:46.386
No, we just kissed.

46:46.721 --> 46:47.804
That's pennies.

46:47.889 --> 46:51.725
And then I ran out of the room.
We made out for like 25 minutes.

46:51.809 --> 46:52.893
That's not hideous.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.270
- He tried to put the tip in.
- Okay.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.814
- I wouldn't let him put the tip in.
- Yeah, that is...

46:58.858 --> 47:00.484
You're not gonna win an award
with that one.

47:00.568 --> 47:02.194
You can't tell... You can say, "Moe.

47:02.278 --> 47:04.154
"He tried to put the tip in,
but I didn't let him. "

47:15.875 --> 47:17.209
Sister code.

47:19.754 --> 47:21.755
Did you sleep with him?

47:22.423 --> 47:23.673
It's okay.

47:24.592 --> 47:25.634
Sister code?

47:26.677 --> 47:28.303
I didn't.

47:28.888 --> 47:30.805
I do not believe you!

47:30.890 --> 47:32.891
I can't believe we're still on this.

47:32.975 --> 47:35.185
It wasn't even my idea
to bring her to the party.

47:35.269 --> 47:38.396
Oh, no? Sorry.
Why were you late to work yesterday?

47:38.481 --> 47:39.856
Because I slept in!

47:39.941 --> 47:41.733
And I couldn't wake her up and get her out
of my apartment!

47:41.817 --> 47:42.859
Oh, sleepy.

47:42.944 --> 47:44.194
Okay. One more time, guys.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.112
I'm going to keep it open this time, all right?

47:46.197 --> 47:49.282
Nancy is a volcano of sensuality,

47:49.367 --> 47:51.159
you could have experienced her eruption.

47:51.661 --> 47:53.286
Volcanoes kill people, Cher.

47:53.454 --> 47:55.455
You're just miffed about Carol.

47:55.915 --> 47:57.082
What about Carol?

47:57.625 --> 47:59.334
What? I thought you'd tell him.

47:59.877 --> 48:00.919
Tell me what?

48:01.921 --> 48:04.965
Mimi knows Gustav's maid, Alla,

48:05.049 --> 48:07.175
because the Russian community
is very interconnected.

48:07.260 --> 48:08.426
Okay. So what'd she say?

48:11.889 --> 48:14.641
She said that Carol
spent the night at Gustav's.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.226
So I guess they...

48:21.732 --> 48:22.816
Cut!

48:22.900 --> 48:25.569
Okay, let's go again.
It's a police station, remember. Okay?

48:25.653 --> 48:28.863
Less restaurant hubbub and more
aggro conversation in the background.

48:29.073 --> 48:31.700
Snacks, take it to the kitchen,
for Christ's sake!

48:31.909 --> 48:33.243
Sorry.

48:36.998 --> 48:40.000
I'm sure they probably just did oral.

48:43.170 --> 48:46.631
I noticed you had some fine-looking girls
there at the party.

48:46.716 --> 48:50.343
There was this one girl that I took down.

48:50.553 --> 48:53.388
At first glance, you look at her,
I thought her face was kind of rough.

48:53.472 --> 48:56.891
But at second glance, whoa! She's super hot.

48:56.976 --> 48:59.227
And she was a crasher
so she was a little feisty,

48:59.312 --> 49:00.437
- if you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

49:00.521 --> 49:03.690
She let me rip her panties off
as soon as I stuck my tongue in her mouth.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.901
Holy cow! Man, you got lucky, kid!
You sound like me!

49:06.986 --> 49:08.028
And here's the crazy thing.

49:08.112 --> 49:10.447
She is the chick who snagged
the gig from me!

49:10.906 --> 49:11.906
No shit!

49:11.991 --> 49:13.908
She is the chick who snagged
the gig from me.

49:13.993 --> 49:14.993
- You're kidding me.
- No.

49:15.077 --> 49:18.163
Well, you showed her who's the boss,
didn't you? You're the boss!

49:18.247 --> 49:19.873
Hey, man! I'm the boss!

49:19.957 --> 49:23.043
It doesn't matter. I'll never see her again.
So whatever. You know what I mean?

49:23.127 --> 49:25.879
No, no. She bitch-slapped you
by stealing that gig from you.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.923
I think you should have a little fun.
Play this vixen out. You understand?

49:29.008 --> 49:33.970
After all, it's her fault
for messing with the scorpion. Am I right?

49:34.055 --> 49:36.723
- Am I right?
- Yes, you are right, Sam.

49:36.891 --> 49:39.559
Give her the stinger! Once more from me,
if you don't mind.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.564
Unknown number? Hello.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.399
- Gotcha.
- Who is this?

49:46.734 --> 49:50.111
Come on. You should recognize my voice.
After all, most of the country does.

49:50.279 --> 49:53.948
- Mr. Warner.
- That's right.

49:54.033 --> 49:57.243
Yeah, I can't talk right now
'cause I have to go to work.

49:57.411 --> 50:00.038
Oh, really?
You snaking another one of my jobs?

50:01.040 --> 50:02.540
What are you? A detective?

50:02.625 --> 50:06.836
No. But I'll search you anyway.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.005
You're cheesy.

50:09.090 --> 50:10.632
Hey, come on. You're laughing.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.261
To answer your question, no,
I'm not stealing anything.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.681
It's a job that was offered directly to me.

50:17.765 --> 50:18.973
Oh! Well, break a lung.

50:19.058 --> 50:20.308
Thanks, I won't.

50:20.393 --> 50:22.352
Bye, Carol Solomon.

50:23.062 --> 50:25.021
I'm the boss.

50:26.982 --> 50:29.984
The new Saber Tooth
bristle brush technology

50:30.069 --> 50:34.698
is patented to be soft on hair,
hard on fly-aways.

50:35.074 --> 50:39.494
Saber Tooth. Because nobody's purrr-fect.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.124
So where's Louis?

50:44.208 --> 50:46.543
- He's sick and went home early.
- He doesn't want to see you.

50:46.794 --> 50:48.503
- What?
- Not what I said.

50:48.587 --> 50:50.672
I heard through the grapevine

50:50.798 --> 50:53.425
they want you to V.O. the promo
for that crazy trilogy.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.760
And don't bust me for dropping
the broccoli.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.137
What crazy trilogy?

50:57.430 --> 50:59.764
Oh, my God, The Amazon Games!

50:59.932 --> 51:01.474
How could you not have heard of this?

51:01.559 --> 51:02.976
It's common pop knowledge.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.185
I don't have an agent.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.896
First off, it's a quadrilogy.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.022
Great.

51:08.107 --> 51:11.025
It's an adaptation of
the hyper fantasy book series.

51:11.110 --> 51:14.320
It's about these fierce mutated female
Amazonian warriors

51:14.405 --> 51:19.325
as the sole future world-inhabiting species
battling cloned prehistoric cavemen hybrids.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.077
It's all based on the Prussian War.

51:21.162 --> 51:27.041
Anyway, they're reinstating the hokey
"In a world... " gimmick

51:27.209 --> 51:28.585
and everybody's in a huff, I guess.

51:28.669 --> 51:30.920
Because it marks the rebirth of epic cinema!

51:31.005 --> 51:32.172
Whatever.

51:32.298 --> 51:35.008
I'm just glad it's a woman this time
instead of a sweaty old man.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.176
I'll see you guys.

51:36.260 --> 51:37.260
Yeah. Congrats.

51:37.344 --> 51:39.387
Thank you for dropping the broccoli.

51:40.181 --> 51:42.056
You should cut your hair.

51:42.141 --> 51:45.602
Stop trying to woo me by being mean.
It doesn't work.

51:46.437 --> 51:47.437
You want to get a drink later?

51:47.646 --> 51:48.646
Okay.

51:51.192 --> 51:53.693
Hey! Watch it!

51:54.153 --> 51:55.862
That is so rude.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.071
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

51:57.156 --> 51:58.615
I just want to give you my card.

51:58.741 --> 52:01.159
I'm not a vocal coach anymore,
but I would make an exception for you

52:01.243 --> 52:02.702
because you sound like a squeaky toy.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.370
And I don't mean that in a bad way.

52:04.622 --> 52:07.248
I think you're better than that.
And I think we're all better than that.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.042
It's good for the species.
You know what I mean?

52:09.126 --> 52:11.544
There's also a Jamba Juice
two blocks away from here.

52:11.712 --> 52:13.379
'Cause I bet you were looking for a smoothie.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.965
Maybe not. I don't know. But if you were,

52:16.050 --> 52:17.592
you know where it is.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.851
Excited or farting?

52:31.190 --> 52:33.066
How are you?

52:34.151 --> 52:36.152
I just came back to get my cell phone.

52:36.237 --> 52:39.280
There is no way to function in
the modern world without one.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.158
Yeah. No, I know it.

52:43.911 --> 52:45.829
Do you want to talk about anything or...

52:45.913 --> 52:49.207
- There's nothing you can say, Carol.
- Right. I know. I know.

52:52.169 --> 52:54.254
I wish that there was

52:56.173 --> 52:57.590
a bubble or something, you know,

52:58.175 --> 53:00.093
that we could just step into

53:00.177 --> 53:03.555
where there was no judgment
or past or present.

53:06.225 --> 53:10.353
A bubble where I can hear her say

53:10.437 --> 53:14.190
why she did it in a vortex.

53:16.235 --> 53:21.364
Sort of. Yeah. Not the bubble part of it,
but the general...

53:21.448 --> 53:24.659
Listen, I'm staying at my friend PJ's
editing suite,

53:24.743 --> 53:26.452
- 'cause I got a lot of deadlines.
- PJ?

53:26.537 --> 53:28.162
And he's got a comfy couch

53:28.247 --> 53:29.956
and this stupid yellow lab
that definitely thinks

53:30.040 --> 53:31.249
I'm the best person that ever lived.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.668
PJ who, though? Just so I know...

53:33.794 --> 53:35.670
I really gotta be away
from everything right now. Okay?

53:35.754 --> 53:36.754
Okay.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.551
Hey. I got good news.

53:41.635 --> 53:43.052
What?

53:43.679 --> 53:47.640
Dinner at Dad's tonight.
The groupie's making casseroles.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.475
I'm ignoring that.

53:49.685 --> 53:52.478
Come on. Yum-yum.

53:52.980 --> 53:54.981
Hamburger hash.

54:00.279 --> 54:02.238
Have you spoken to Moe?

54:08.329 --> 54:12.790
I feel so lost without him.

54:15.294 --> 54:18.671
Like I can't even tell him,
you know? Because...

54:21.300 --> 54:25.011
I know. I know. If you could... If you could...

54:25.095 --> 54:30.475
If you could tell him, what would you say?

54:31.310 --> 54:36.522
In a way, that's kind of a good...
It's a good exercise

54:37.107 --> 54:41.110
to just let it out. Just let it flow.

54:41.195 --> 54:43.988
Whatever you want to say.

54:44.073 --> 54:46.032
- I am. Carol.
- Okay.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.116
Jesus.

54:48.369 --> 54:52.246
It's just that nobody takes care of me
the way that he does.

54:52.414 --> 54:54.916
I just feel really safe with him.

54:56.293 --> 54:59.879
The only thing I gave him in return
is total dishonesty.

55:00.339 --> 55:03.299
It doesn't even matter that I didn't sleep
with that asshole, right?

55:03.384 --> 55:05.802
- Tip or no tip.
- Tip, as in "gratuity"?

55:06.303 --> 55:10.264
God! I should not even have been in his
room in the first place.

55:10.349 --> 55:13.977
I hate myself. I hate myself.

55:14.353 --> 55:16.270
I hate myself for doing that.

55:16.355 --> 55:19.232
I hate myself for squandering
the most beautiful thing

55:19.316 --> 55:21.401
I ever had in my whole stupid life.

55:24.405 --> 55:30.952
I'm so scared.
I'm so scared, Carol, that I'm gonna lose him.

55:32.329 --> 55:36.708
And I'm so sad because
I'm not good enough for him

55:36.792 --> 55:38.793
and I don't deserve him.

55:39.378 --> 55:42.422
And I don't deserve his sandwich bar.

55:45.384 --> 55:49.637
Who's that hot friend of Moe's?

55:51.432 --> 55:54.434
Named PJ?

55:56.395 --> 55:58.354
'Cause I kinda want to date him.

55:58.939 --> 55:59.939
Wait, what?

56:00.024 --> 56:02.316
PJ?

56:02.401 --> 56:04.527
PJ Koopchick?

56:04.611 --> 56:08.948
PJ Koopchick. I think it was, yeah,
PJ Koopchick.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.324
He's married.

56:10.409 --> 56:15.121
Oh, my God! PJ Koopchick's married?
Jesus, another good one gone.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.373
He's really fat. Hairy.

56:17.458 --> 56:22.670
Yeah. I know. You know I like that. Like Dad.

56:22.755 --> 56:27.759
That's literally why I was always into
PJ Koopchick.

56:32.431 --> 56:33.890
What are these?

56:33.974 --> 56:35.433
Oh, they're just cherries from a can.

56:35.517 --> 56:36.559
From Canter's.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.394
No, I made it.

56:38.479 --> 56:41.731
Just kidding.
It's as Jewish as you can get in her family.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.984
That's a good one.

56:45.944 --> 56:47.403
Listen, I wanted to show you something.

56:47.988 --> 56:50.948
I came across this article I wrote
decades ago.

56:51.283 --> 56:56.287
I think it's worth a read.
Have a look at it. It's all about goals.

56:56.413 --> 56:59.082
I wish I could write.
Your father's book was so...

56:59.166 --> 57:00.166
I'll give it to you after.

57:00.250 --> 57:02.418
I'm no Philip Roth, but I try.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.087
Dani was always a really good writer.

57:04.171 --> 57:05.463
You don't have to do that.

57:05.547 --> 57:07.340
It must run in the family.

57:07.424 --> 57:10.635
My aunt Peggy writes a column
for health journal in Ohio.

57:10.761 --> 57:13.179
But she's not really related to me, 'cause
it's my mom's brother's wife.

57:15.182 --> 57:16.891
You kids with your phones.

57:16.975 --> 57:18.518
That is what I'm talking about.

57:18.769 --> 57:20.228
Oh, look at these.
They're almost too pretty to eat.

57:20.521 --> 57:23.231
So, how's the Moe situation?

57:26.485 --> 57:28.402
Listen. We're all family here.

57:28.487 --> 57:30.154
I think we can look to each other
for strength.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.447
Oh, my God!

57:31.532 --> 57:33.950
Jamie, I think, could be real helpful
in this situation.

57:34.034 --> 57:36.285
I actually have to run to the little girls' room.
Excuse me.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.495
"How's the Moe situation?"

57:37.579 --> 57:39.413
Listen, Dani. Let me tell you something.

57:39.498 --> 57:41.415
I don't think you did anything wrong.

57:41.583 --> 57:42.625
Oh, okay. Thanks, Dad.

57:42.709 --> 57:44.502
No, I mean it. Moe's gonna get over this.

57:44.628 --> 57:46.254
Okay. I'm sure.

57:46.505 --> 57:48.881
You know, people make mistakes in life.
I know I have.

57:49.675 --> 57:53.427
Marriage is all about forgiveness.
Your mother understood that.

57:53.512 --> 57:55.263
Yeah! Mom totally understood that.

57:55.389 --> 57:56.430
She understood it completely.

57:56.515 --> 57:59.433
I mean, she did OD on the prescription
meds that she had to take

57:59.518 --> 58:01.435
to deal with the anxiety that you caused her.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.146
In the first place, let me explain something.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.397
I don't want to split hairs, Dad.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.440
Your mother had a deep affection
for Sudafed,

58:06.525 --> 58:09.152
which accidentally interfered
with her love affair with Valium.

58:09.236 --> 58:10.444
It was Xanax. It was definitely Xanax.

58:10.529 --> 58:11.571
Don't start!

58:11.655 --> 58:14.115
She was going out with Howard Wetson
when she died!

58:14.199 --> 58:16.659
At least Howard Wetson
knows I don't like bell peppers!

58:16.743 --> 58:19.871
For Christ's sake, it was 16 years ago.
Would you let it pass?

58:19.955 --> 58:23.791
Jesus Christ. The moment I find one little
iota of happiness

58:23.876 --> 58:26.460
the two of you have to start blaming
your mother's death on me.

58:26.545 --> 58:29.505
- No one's blaming you, okay?
- Don't be so crass.

58:29.590 --> 58:31.424
You're blaming yourself!

58:31.508 --> 58:34.969
So Mom died. Do we need to rehash that?

58:35.137 --> 58:36.762
I feel like we really got into...

58:36.847 --> 58:38.181
Here, Jamie, try some of these.
They're very good.

58:38.265 --> 58:39.557
I don't want to eat them all myself.

58:39.641 --> 58:42.643
I already had one, but, yeah,
they're pretty good.

58:43.020 --> 58:44.103
So, I have news.

58:44.188 --> 58:46.814
What news? You're not pregnant, are you?

58:46.982 --> 58:48.357
All we need.

58:48.442 --> 58:49.483
Oh, I'm just kidding.

58:49.568 --> 58:51.485
No, I've been working.

58:51.612 --> 58:53.905
- The vocal coaching, right?
- Terrific, yeah.

58:54.031 --> 58:58.326
No, no. I just booked these two voice over...
Like, movie trailer voice over gigs.

58:58.535 --> 59:01.454
And I wanted to share that with you
because it all started

59:01.538 --> 59:04.373
because I swiped this really big job
from Gustav Warner,

59:04.583 --> 59:07.251
who I finally met at the party you guys
brought me to.

59:07.419 --> 59:11.839
And now I'm going to be the voice
of this new epic quadrilogy.

59:11.965 --> 59:15.176
And I get to be the first woman to utter
the words "In a world... "

59:15.469 --> 59:16.677
Sam!

59:17.137 --> 59:19.263
- Are you okay?
- Dad, have some water.

59:19.681 --> 59:23.434
Excuse me. Wait a second.
That's you? You're the thief?

59:23.644 --> 59:25.519
The what?

59:25.604 --> 59:27.521
"The thief," it sounds like a crime novel.

59:27.606 --> 59:29.106
You're dating Gustav Warner?

59:29.191 --> 59:30.608
Wait. How do you know about that?

59:30.692 --> 59:32.568
It's more like fucking probably
than I would say dating.

59:32.653 --> 59:35.404
Jesus Christ!
Why don't you tell me any of this stuff?

59:35.656 --> 59:37.365
You don't ask about the stuff.

59:37.449 --> 59:39.075
You don't ever ask about us or anything.

59:39.159 --> 59:41.953
Sam, a daughter should not have to share
her sex life with her father.

59:42.037 --> 59:43.663
Yes, thank you, Jamie. I appreciate it.

59:43.872 --> 59:48.376
Listen, sweetheart, let me explain something
to you, okay? This is a business.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.796
An industry you've seen from
arm's length for your entire life.

59:51.880 --> 59:52.922
And there's a reason for that.

59:53.006 --> 59:57.134
You don't just put one promo,
one trailer on your rÃ©â€ŽsumÃ©â€Ž

59:57.219 --> 59:59.262
and expect to get
a gigantic job like that.

59:59.388 --> 01:00:02.848
I've booked, actually, three movie trailer
gigs and then now this quadrilogy.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.767
You have to understand
something, sweetheart.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.686
They would never try and resurrect

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:11.107
something this important,
this iconic with a freshman vocal.

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:14.610
It's not done.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.615
Well, I think I could go for some
of that nice green tea.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.033
Could we have some of that?

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:23.160
I don't drink caffeine, remember?

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:26.706
Yes. Clearly, I forgot about that, Jamie.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.666
Carol?

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.584
- Can we go, please?
- Carol! Don't. Wait.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:31.961
- Do you want me to start it?
- Carol! Wait.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.129
- Do I have the keys?
- Carol, would you wait?

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:35.172
I'm in my heels. I've been working all day.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.590
- I can't even walk.
- I'm sorry.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:40.136
I don't believe him.
I think he's lying about the whole quadrilogy.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.722
It's fine. He's a legend.
It makes sense they would give him the line.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:43.848
I call bullshit. I call bullshit.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:47.601
Because that man cannot let anybody
in this whole goddamn family shine

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:49.979
because Nana was a cunt to him
when he was a little kid.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:51.731
Nana was a survivor.
You should be easy on Nana.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.607
Yeah, right. You know what?
You gotta believe me.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:56.610
You cannot expect that man
to ever be supportive of you.

01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.612
He is totally incapable of that.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:01.115
I think the studio is going to be very
pleased to learn

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.951
that I've been reconsidering
and now I'm very much interested

01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:05.494
in doing the quadrilogy gig.

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.829
For what? The Amazon Games?

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:07.997
Exactly.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.123
Sam, it's too late.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.249
What do you mean, "Too late"?

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.751
How am I supposed to tell them to recast it?

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:14.587
Because I'm Sam goddamn Sotto.
That's why.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:15.838
The studio wants Carol.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:20.426
I suppose you can put yourself on tape.
Give it a shot.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.136
Very well then. So be it. Okay.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:26.307
In that case, I will put myself on tape
with everybody else.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:28.726
And I will conquer.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:32.646
Alla! Before you leave make me one more
of those soy white Russians.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:33.898
I'm sorry, Siegel. What were you saying?

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.484
You're not gonna believe this,
but Sotto, he's back in.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:37.651
To what? Amazon Games?

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:39.653
Your girlfriend's not the only one
to beat out now.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.697
The legend himself? Are you kidding me?

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:43.657
I thought you guys were pals?

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:44.784
Yeah, so did I.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:48.788
You're not gonna be able to screw yourself
out of a voice over battle with Sotto.

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:59.757
"Better than a bubble. "

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:04.845
How am I gonna play this?

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:18.943
Hey.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.529
Your voice sounds bad. Are you sick?

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:25.616
Oh, no. I just woke up

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.244
'cause I was up talking to my sister till late.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.664
Right, where are you now?

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.708
I'm at my sister's place in Koreatown.

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.085
Yeah, Koreatown. That's funny

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:40.506
because I'm right in your neighborhood.
I'm pretty much right near you right now.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.758
Hey! Why don't we get a snack?

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:44.677
Let's get a snack.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:45.761
All right.

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:51.392
But I'm gonna need a second to spiff up.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.686
Totally. You know what?
You take a couple of minutes.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:56.730
You know, I'll just text you where I am
and just meet me downstairs

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.357
and then we'll figure it out.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:03.904
I'm sorry.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.489
I'm good. That's cool.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:08.200
I got you a hot water with lemon.

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:10.453
Gargle that.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.746
Oh, I'm good on the gargle.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:13.914
- Sure. Whatever.
- Thank you.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:15.708
You want to take a walk?

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:16.917
Sure.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:25.759
Okay, here's the deal. My life consists
mainly of work, family, fantasy baseball.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.720
You do that? I didn't know you did that.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.597
- Yeah, Rotisserie League with my friends.
- Oh, right on.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.267
I'm not a meddler, okay? But I like you.

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:34.727
So when I heard something about you...

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.145
What did you hear about me?

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:37.771
I'm not done with my speech here.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.523
Oh, I didn't know there was a speech.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.317
Yes, it's a pitch. To be precise.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:42.485
Is that a baseball reference?

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:43.777
No, no. It's a literal pitch,

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:46.113
like I want to pitch you an idea
kind of thing, okay?

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:47.948
So, I grew up with three sisters.

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:49.825
So I've always been into women's rights.

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.495
And I listen to the Cranberries openly.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.079
Oh, what about Zombie or Linger?

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.040
Linger. I like Linger better.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.958
Really? I would have pegged you
as a Zombie.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.752
- Okay, can I finish?
- Yeah.

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:02.630
I'm really excited about you doing
the quadrilogy job, okay.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.590
It's a big deal for a woman to be considered
for that job.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:07.551
No, I know, I guess Cher must've
had that wrong, I don't know.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.345
- No, she didn't.
- Yeah.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:12.348
No, no. Gustav was up for it
because the director wanted him,

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:16.143
but then when that executive heard
your voice, the job was yours.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.979
- But now that your dad's back in...
- What do you mean he's back in?

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:20.981
- What? I thought you knew.
- No.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:24.610
As of last night, his reps are pushing for him
to be considered for it.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:27.112
So now the studio feels like
they have choices.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.198
Each person is responsible
for recording and mixing

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:30.991
their own audition, which is due tomorrow.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:32.785
And I'd love to help you with that.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.246
I gotta go back 'cause I gotta talk to Dani.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.122
Danny? Who's Danny? Do you like him?

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.875
No, Dani's my sister.
I was gonna see her before I...

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:45.965
What is the matter with you?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:47.633
I'm sorry. I was trying to get your attention.

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:48.759
My mom has ADHD and it's like...

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:50.302
It's called positive road blocking.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.138
It's just a way to kind of like jolt somebody
into like focusing.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:55.849
Can I just finish my mission here?

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.059
Yes.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.144
Positive...

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:01.063
- Look.
- What?

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.983
I like you. I really like you.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.402
I know you're seeing Gustav Warner
right now and I just...

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.612
How does everybody know about that?
I don't understand.

01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:09.863
The Russian community is really tight.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:13.242
The point is this.
Gustav's housekeeper Alla

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:15.619
told Heners' wife Mimi that Gustav
just slept with you

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:16.829
to push you off your game.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:20.374
He doesn't even consider you
a real threat for the job.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:23.335
Now I say screw that wet lettuce piece of shit.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:24.712
Let's step up to the plate.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:26.505
It's the bottom of the ninth,
the bases are loaded.

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.882
Let's give the voice over industry
something to talk about here.

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.342
What do you say?

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.886
I'm sorry. Got carried away there.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.889
You surprised me, Louis. God.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:38.726
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It was a good pitch.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:41.854
Was it? Good.
'Cause I actually did rehearse it.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.149
I like you, too.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.153
What?

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.155
I do.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:55.034
She likes me.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.454
All right.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.496
Sandwich bar!

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:53.759
Watch your step.

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:58.472
Louis, thank you so much for letting me
stay here.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.934
I appreciate it. My sister and her husband
needed some emergency alone time.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.018
Watch out for that.

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:06.063
Hey, no sweat. It's my pleasure.

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.607
Welcome, welcome.

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:09.983
This is cool.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.110
- You like it?
- Yeah.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.361
Well, I finally got you here.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.988
I mean as much as we've known
each other for a while.

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:17.449
You've never been here before.
That's all I meant by that.

01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:19.868
Oh, wow. Is that a couch bed?

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:20.994
Yeah.

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:23.288
Oh, that's cool. It looks great.
You're good at that.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.957
I find myself sleeping on the couch so much.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.792
Oh, no, that's too bad.

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:27.918
You're in here, by the way.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:29.002
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.254
No, no. That looks awesome.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.798
Look. I put waters next to the bed.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.259
- I happen to be a couch aficionado.
- I re-did the sheets.

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:37.010
All clean sheets for you.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:38.095
- I can't.
- I insist. Come on.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:40.013
Tomorrow's game day.

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:42.850
You're the athlete.
The athlete sleeps in the bed.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:47.688
The coach sleeps on the couch.
I insist. Sleep well. Okay?

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:48.772
Okay.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.818
Was it something I said?

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:55.612
Oh, hey, no. I was just trying
to give you privacy.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.281
Oh, okay.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.284
By the way, there's a switch
right next to the bed down there.

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:02.995
If you hit that switch when you want to
go to sleep,

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.246
everything will go dark.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.707
I rigged all the lights into the one switch.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:10.085
Because I hate getting up
and it's like I'm already falling asleep,

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:12.045
and I gotta walk across the room
and whatever.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.798
I'm not showing off.
I'm sure other people have done it, too.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.341
It did take a lot of work actually.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:18.051
There was quite a bit of wiring involved.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:21.095
So, I'm gonna stop talking now
and we'll get some sleep.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.265
If you need anything, coach on the couch.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.350
Okay. Coach on the couch.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.104
Oh! I'm naked!

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.607
Just kidding. I'm not.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.986
- I got you.
- I didn't want to be inappropriate.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.613
- Thank you for the knock.
- Yes.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:42.117
Towels in the bathroom. Fresh.

01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:44.077
Great. Towels.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.912
Not the blue one. Don't use the blue one.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.915
The blue one.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:49.750
What's wrong with the blue one?

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.381
In case you can't get to sleep,

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.426
I left some homeopathic sleeping pills
next to the water.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.680
How'd you know?

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.475
I'm naturally intuitive.

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.770
You went to what?

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:11.104
Who is Viv?

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:14.107
No, there's no Viv. I'm intuitive.

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:17.694
Like a person who has intuition, it's the...

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.613
I think it's the adjectival... It doesn't matter.

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:26.286
I just thought maybe it would be weird
sleeping in the same place

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:28.872
since we've both admitted that we like
each other. You know?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.251
Yeah. It is awkward sort of.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.129
Yeah.

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:39.675
But now that we've acknowledged it,
it's not as weird, though. Right?

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.930
Yeah.

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:48.767
I'm gonna still take
one of these pills, though.

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:51.185
All right. Get some sleep, okay?

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.395
Yeah.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.148
Rest that voice.
We've got a big day tomorrow.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:56.400
I'm trying.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:42.863
We ride. We ride. We ride on a cushion of air.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:47.659
I thought you didn't eat meat.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:54.291
I don't. But on game day
you want to taste the blood, you know?

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.228
I want you to wear this.

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:18.231
Sweetie, let me alone. I need to do
my thing now. I have to concentrate.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:21.693
It's my lucky scarf.
It helped me through my surgery.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:24.071
Surgery? I didn't know you had any
kind of surgery.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.197
Corrective rhinoplasty.

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:28.742
It was so scary and this scarf
was my strength.

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:32.287
Thank you, Jamie. I really appreciate it.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.247
You're welcome.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:36.166
- All right. Let's hit it.
- Okay!

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:39.211
Here we go.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.296
Remember.
First the right button, then you slate.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:43.340
Right button. Okay.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:46.927
Check one.

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:49.972
No, you push the button first, then you slate.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:51.390
Okay.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:53.934
Action.

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:56.937
- Just say "Take 1."
- Take 1.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:00.232
Take 1.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.943
Test 1. This is Sam Sotto.

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.027
That sounds real good.

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:07.239
Sweetie, I'm in the middle of recording.
You have to keep absolute silence, okay?

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:08.532
Okay, I didn't know.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.243
Once more. This time it's "Take 2,"
don't forget.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:12.411
Okay.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:19.334
- Take 1... Two! Take 2.
- Take 2.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.259
Excuse me.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.679
Hey, make sure your phone's turned off.
I think we're getting some feedback out here.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.391
Sorry.

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:39.896
All right, Carol. Let me hear
your levels.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:41.273
Yeah, hold on.

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:50.365
Testing, testing, one, two, three.
How does that sound?

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.451
Good, sounds great.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:53.910
Okay.

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:55.370
All right.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:58.415
The Amazon Games promo, take 1.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.837
In a world...

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:08.008
Where a hybrid breed
of mutant male savages...

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:12.929
Are feeding on the barren lands
of Mother Earth.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:18.894
A time where mankind
has been replaced by womankind.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:23.815
A battle of epic strength
will collapse a barbaric enemy.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:25.400
One woman...

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:31.364
Dared to rise up and exceed
the boundaries of the impossible.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:35.994
From the literary phenomenon
that inspired a generation...

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.413
Comes a quadrilogy...

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:41.458
Of one brave warrior
who must fight for her land.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:46.421
From BAFTA winning director,
Terrence Pouncer.

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.965
The Amazon Games.

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:52.469
It's a broad new world.

01:13:56.516 --> 01:13:59.434
I cannot wait to see that movie.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:06.525
Oh, man.

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:12.114
Oh, thanks for that, babe.
That was unbelievable.

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.491
I don't understand why you think

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:17.869
you have to deprive yourself
of pleasure before you perform.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.122
You were so tense.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:24.000
Now, now, Jamie.
They have to hear the sex in your voice.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:28.171
Oh, there's always sex in your voice, Sam.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.387
So, how do you feel?

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.264
How do I feel? How do you feel?

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.432
I feel awesome. I feel great.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:41.476
Cheers! Awesome.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.480
Seriously, like, you did awesome.
Congrats.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:46.690
Thanks.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:53.947
Hey, do you have to wake up early tomorrow?

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:04.499
Who?

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.534
Carol Solomon, home safe.

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:24.037
- Louis Parker. Thank you.
- Done.

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:25.163
You're a great driver.

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:26.539
I thank you. I wasn't...

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:28.208
No, you're really good at it.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.293
I thought I was very good.
And I'm not drunk, BTW.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:33.213
- No. Of course. I get it.
- I don't even say BTW usually.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:35.548
The tiniest buzz. Potentially.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.550
Louis, can you come back though,
for a second.

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:39.844
Come back.
I have one question for you.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.972
It's a real quick Q.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.560
Do you have any more of those,
like, you know, those...

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:48.687
Songs?

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:51.731
No. The sleeping pills?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.318
No. Not on me.

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:56.528
You know the ones?

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.654
No, I'm sorry. Why?

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:01.283
No. It's just gonna be really hard for me

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:04.869
to fall asleep after you kiss me.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.622
It's gonna be really hard.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.566
She's the whistleblower.

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:36.276
Or the confronter.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.988
Guys! How many hours
of this crap can you watch?

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.489
Honey, you look so cute.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.615
Who died?

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.742
Give me a kiss.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:46.286
We're leaving for the Golden Trailer Awards
in 15 minutes!

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.329
No, I can't.

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:48.413
Dad can suck it.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.082
Your dad is winning
a Lifetime Achievement Award.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.585
You are his only family. We have tickets.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:57.047
You're going if I have to drag you.

01:17:58.049 --> 01:18:00.967
I've a lot of important work
I've gotta do here.

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:02.635
Jeff Garlin's hosting.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.637
This girl's a Daisy Whore.

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:05.764
Let's go!

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.767
Sweat pants off!

01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:13.229
Hey, do we have to do anything, if we
have these?

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:16.399
- This is Sam Sotto's daughters right here.
- Shut up.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:21.613
I can't go in there. Literally, I'm humiliated.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.783
I'm not going in if you're not going in.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.744
Guys! Lifetime Achievement. Lifetime.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:30.163
You work your entire lifetime to win a
Golden Trailer

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:33.083
for the Best Original Foreign Teaser Trailer.

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:35.502
We are just thankful to be recognized.

01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:39.798
I love you, Tracy!

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:42.717
How about that, huh?

01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:46.763
Before the show I saw the two of them
tossing a pumpkin backstage.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:52.685
Must be something they do in their
homeland. Just a warm-up.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:58.191
There's a big deal going on now with
the quadrilogy series.

01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:00.527
Quadrilogy, three books weren't enough.
Four!

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:01.903
And they're making four movies

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:05.115
and the first movie,
you're about to get a... You'll see.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:11.830
Please welcome the executive producer
ofThe Amazon Games, Katherine Huling!

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.750
Thank you.

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:19.963
This year, in honor of the late
Don LaFontaine,

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:24.092
the Golden Trailer Awards
have deemed this the perfect occasion

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:27.929
to unveil the first trailer
forThe Amazon Games.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.683
As you know,
Don coined those three little words

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.519
that make this a truly epic promo.

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.771
And one of which we can all be proud.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:38.898
So without further ado,

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:41.985
take your first look at The Amazon Games.

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:56.791
In a world where a hybrid breed
of mutant male savages

01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:03.131
are feeding on the barren lands of
Mother Earth.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.383
I will avenge you.

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:11.764
A time where mankind has been replaced
by womankind.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:16.519
A battle of epic strength

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:20.940
will collapse a barbaric enemy.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:27.739
We will walk! We will run! But we will fight!

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:37.123
Sam!

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:40.793
One woman dared to rise up

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:44.214
and exceed the boundaries
of the impossible.

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:46.508
This land is ours!

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:50.386
From the literary phenomenon
that inspired a generation

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:53.264
comes the quadrilogy

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:57.810
of one brave warrior
who must fight for her land.

01:20:57.895 --> 01:20:59.771
The Amazon Games.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:09.906
Sammy, don't scream.
It's bad for your larynx!

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:13.826
Sam! You stop it right now!

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:16.454
Oh, cork it, Jamie!

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:20.792
Now, you listen to me, Samuel Solomon.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:24.546
I am my mother's daughter and you cannot
talk to me like that

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.339
no matter how bad you're hurting.

01:21:26.423 --> 01:21:30.343
You buck up and be proud
of your daughter, damn it.

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.024
Dad.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:54.075
Now when you're done standing there
crying and feeling sorry for yourself

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.786
you are gonna go and apologize
to both your daughters

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.204
for being such a jerk.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.665
Okay?

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.917
And you're gonna be a good daddy
from now on

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:07.088
or else you can say goodbye to me
and my perfect nose.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.595
You're a better man than you think, Sammy.

01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:17.265
Winning isn't everything. Family is.

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:21.436
And being nice is a lot more fun. You'll see.

01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:33.865
Oh, my God! You're... Hi. I'm Carol Solomon.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:34.949
I know who you are.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:37.035
Of course you do. That's stupid.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.913
Listen, I want to take
this opportunity to thank you.

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:42.915
I really appreciate you taking
a chance on me.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.211
I know you hire whoever's
best for the job, but I just...

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:50.798
- Carol, let me level with you.
- It's really special.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:55.928
Sure, you have perfect tone
and a strong sound

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:57.347
that's a fitting choice for the genre.

01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:58.931
Oh, thanks.

01:22:59.016 --> 01:23:03.227
But I'm using you for a bigger purpose.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:09.942
This pseudo-feminist fantasy tween
chick-lit bullshit

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:13.196
is a devolution of the female mission.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.115
It's cancerous to the intelligence
of young women.

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:19.410
You got this job because
whether the general public

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:23.665
chooses to acknowledge it or not,
voice over matters.

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.959
Everyone in the world watches movie trailers.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:30.963
Everyone in the world sees commercials
on television.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:36.052
Or they hear them on the radio.
And that is power!

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:45.019
Look, this quadrilogy is going to make
billions of dollars

01:23:45.104 --> 01:23:51.067
and your voice is going to be the one
to inspire every girl who hears it.

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:54.112
And that's why I chose you.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.031
Not because you were the best for the job.

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:59.200
Because frankly, you weren't.

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:04.080
I bet your dad is proud.

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:13.005
Okay. You're gonna be great.

01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:19.387
You screwed me over.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.473
You screwed my daughter.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.642
Yes, I did.

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:25.893
I don't like him one bit.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:28.980
Which is partially a joke.
Really rubbed me the wrong way.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.734
But nonetheless, I'm going to introduce him.
Please welcome

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.861
Gustav Warner, everybody.

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:43.870
Thank you. Thank you.

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:49.959
Tonight, one voice transcends
the very generation it represents.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:53.129
One voice soars above the rest.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.592
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor to present

01:24:57.676 --> 01:25:02.680
the recipient of the Golden Trailer
Lifetime Achievement Award,

01:25:03.182 --> 01:25:04.766
Sam Sotto.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.149
Good job, Sam.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:27.371
I'm so very sorry.

01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:34.170
My voice seems to have finally
thrown in the towel.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.215
I just wanted to...

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:43.888
Well, I had you all going there for a minute,
didn't I?

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:47.099
But in all sincerity,

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:49.185
I just wanted to express

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:54.690
how deeply grateful I am
for this tremendous accolade.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:26:01.781
You know, a great voice isn't only a blessing,
it's also a choice.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:06.744
And I choose every day to be a part
of this great industry.

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:11.123
Now, I'm not quite done
with my career yet,

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:13.209
so don't get too excited, Gustav.

01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:18.965
But I'm proud to say

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:21.926
that the tradition carries on.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:26.514
It's surprising where some of our
new iconic voices will emerge from.

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:31.185
You know,

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:35.231
my father used to say to me,

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:38.234
"You're good, kid,

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:41.237
"but as long as I'm around,

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.240
"you'll never be as good as me. "

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:52.248
Well, this award sure does make me feeI
pretty good.

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:58.296
And so tonight
I'd like to dedicate this award

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:06.637
to my daughters,
who make me very proud.

01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:15.646
Thank you.

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:30.328
It's a broad new world.

01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:34.332
All right. Thanks so much.

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:39.503
So I shared that with all of you guys 'cause
I wanted to remind you

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.505
why you're all here today.

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:44.008
I guess let's start with Stacy.

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:46.218
Stacy, what do you do for a living?

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.220
I'm a corporate attorney.

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:50.222
Great. And I know you've been on a job hunt.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:51.349
How's that going for you?

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:55.770
I've been interviewing for about 10 months.

01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:57.772
And why do you think that is?

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.107
Because I sound like a sexy baby.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:02.693
Which may be great for the bedroom.

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:03.861
Yeah. It is.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:09.200
But am I really going to hire a sexy baby

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.244
to defend me in a patent infringement
lawsuit?

01:28:12.371 --> 01:28:13.454
Right. No.

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:15.998
Over the next six weeks

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:19.627
Louis will be recording your voices

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.254
and we will listen to your sounds evolve.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:24.757
Right before your very ears.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:26.884
'Cause women should sound like women.

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:30.763
Not baby dolls who end everything
in a question.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.307
Let's make a statement.

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:36.394
Now, who's ready to be heard?

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:43.275
Great, so what we're gonna
do is north-south-east-west.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.319
North-south-east-west.

01:28:45.404 --> 01:28:47.405
I'm gonna go say hi to them,
but keep it up.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:51.242
North-south-east-west.
