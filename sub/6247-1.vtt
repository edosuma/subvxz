00:06.120 --> 00:09.078
<i>This is the final boarding call
for Flight 416...</i>

00:09.160 --> 00:11.151
I'm late.

00:11.240 --> 00:15.916
<i>Final boarding call for Flight 416
with service to Dallas/Fort Worth.</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:18.833
This board is broken.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.957
The "Arrivals" board is not working.

00:22.040 --> 00:27.194
Did anybody meet the flight from Guatemala?
Aviataka Airlines? What gate?

00:27.280 --> 00:29.077
Great.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.469
I'm late.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.870
Excuse me. You have a computer
glitch at the "Arrivals" board.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.872
Hello? Sir, excuse me. Yoo-hoo.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.035
Great.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.236
Yeah. Hi.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.390
The flight from Guatemala.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.631
Tell me you tried "Excuse me" first.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.280
Sweetie! Yes, I did.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.669
Welcome home.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.669
Are you exhausted?
Was Guatemala awfuI? Was it backward?

01:01.760 --> 01:05.069
I was never reduced to
flashing my boobs for information.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.559
Flash 'em for fun reasons?

01:06.640 --> 01:09.712
I was literally neck-deep
in a mass grave. Not romantic.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.270
Diving in a pit of cadavers
is no way to handle a messy break-up.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.797
- Nothing Pete and I did was messy.
- Then you were not doing the right thing.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.474
Sir, why are you following us?

01:21.520 --> 01:24.671
Attack! Security! Hello?
Who runs this airport?

01:24.760 --> 01:26.557
Kick his ass!

01:26.640 --> 01:28.517
- Step back, now!
- He attacked me!

01:28.600 --> 01:30.795
I'm Homeland Security!

01:30.880 --> 01:34.190
- A little misunderstanding here.
- Put away your guns.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.432
Is she in charge now? No. I'll tell you
when you can lower your weapons.

01:38.520 --> 01:44.197
- Hand over the bag.
- Is that what this is about?

01:46.520 --> 01:48.670
Boo.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.632
I am Dr Temperance Brennan.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.952
I've been in Guatemala identifying
victims of genocide, including him.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.112
Most people in this situation,
what they do is, they sweat it.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.159
Guatemala, genocide...
How are you scary after that?

02:06.240 --> 02:08.708
- You know who don't sweat it?
- Sociopaths.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.952
- I'm an anthropologist at the Jeffersonian.
- Who works for the FBI.

02:13.040 --> 02:19.275
Which I'd believe if you had an ID that did
more than allow you access to the cafeteria.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.193
You were illegally
transporting human remains,

02:22.280 --> 02:24.999
and you assaulted
a Homeland Security agent.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.719
Sorry if I embarrassed you
in front of your friends.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.679
Next time, ID yourself before attacking me.
What are you doing here?

02:31.760 --> 02:34.149
FBI, SpeciaI Agent Seeley Booth,

02:34.240 --> 02:38.438
Major Crime Investigation, DC.
Bones identifies bodies for us.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.159
Don't call me "Bones".
And I do more than identify.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.151
She also writes books.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.276
Fine. She's all yours.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.115
- Grab your skull and let's vamoose.
- That's it? Why did you stop me?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.351
What does it matter?
You're free to go. Grab your bags.

02:58.440 --> 03:03.434
You set me up. You got a "hold
for questioning request" from the FBI.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.590
I love this book.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.869
Come on.

03:14.960 --> 03:20.432
That's the best you can do? Getting Security
to snatch me so you can stage a fake rescue?

03:20.520 --> 03:26.197
At least I picked you up at the airport.
Come on. Your assistant stonewalled me.

03:26.280 --> 03:31.195
After the last case, I told Zack
never to put you through. Let me out.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.716
A corpse was found
at Arlington NationaI Cemetery...

03:34.800 --> 03:39.351
Arlington NationaI Cemetery
is full of corpses. It's a cemetery.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.590
But this one wasn't in a casket.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.638
If you drive one more block,
I'm screaming "kidnap".

03:44.720 --> 03:49.032
- I'm trying to mend bridges here.
- Pull over.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.309
- I'm going home.
- Could we just skip this part?

03:56.400 --> 03:59.039
- I find you very condescending.
- Me?

03:59.120 --> 04:02.271
I'm not the one who mentions
she's got a doctorate every...

04:02.360 --> 04:05.830
- I am the one with the doctorate.
- I'm the one with the gun.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.789
- You're not the only forensic anthropologist.
- I am. The next nearest is in MontreaI.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.757
<i>Parlez-vous Fran√ßais?</i>

04:12.840 --> 04:14.876
What's it gonna take?

04:16.480 --> 04:18.596
- Full participation.
- Fine.

04:18.680 --> 04:22.719
- Notjust lab work. Everything.
- We're Scully and Mulder.

04:22.800 --> 04:28.158
- I don't know what that means.
- It's an olive branch. Just get back in the car.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.235
- What's the context of the find?
- Routine landscaping.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.914
One of the workmen
thought he saw something.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.596
- Hi, Zack.
- This eco-warrior look works for you.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.796
- Thanks.
- Very action-oriented.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.031
- You remember my assistant, Zack Addy?
- Yeah.

04:51.120 --> 04:55.989
How was Guatemala?
Learn a thing or two about machete strikes?

04:56.080 --> 04:59.629
- I need samples and temperature readings.
- Right away.

04:59.720 --> 05:04.953
- He's got no discretion. TypicaI squint.
- I don't know what that means.

05:05.040 --> 05:10.910
Cops get stuck, we bring in people like you.
Squints. You know, who squint at things.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.028
You mean people with very high IQs
and basic reasoning skills?

05:16.120 --> 05:17.109
Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.240 --> 05:33.028
What exactly am I
supposed to be squinting at?

05:33.120 --> 05:37.352
It's like pornography.
You'll know it when you see it.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.636
Yeah, OK.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.837
This is a crime scene.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.877
The remains are wrapped
in poly construction sheeting.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.598
PVC-coated chicken wire.

07:03.680 --> 07:08.435
Weighted. That's why the body
didn't surface during decomposition.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.592
- The skull is in fragments.
- What can you tell me?

07:11.680 --> 07:16.151
Not much. She was a young woman,
probably between 18 and 22.

07:16.240 --> 07:21.234
Approximately five-foot three,
race unknown, delicate features.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.436
- That's all?
- Tennis player.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.556
How do you get that out of that yuck?

07:25.640 --> 07:28.791
Epiphysis fusion gives age,
pelvic bone gives sex.

07:28.880 --> 07:32.395
Bursitis. Somebody this young,
it must be an athletic injury.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.516
- When did she die?
- Uh...

07:34.600 --> 07:37.910
- What does that mean?
- Wait for the bug-and-slime guy.

07:38.000 --> 07:38.910
No clothing.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.549
In my line of work,
no clothes usually means a sex crime.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.155
It could also mean
the victim favoured naturaI fibres.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.357
Your suit will outlast your bones by decades.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.353
Collect silt, three metres radius
to a depth of ten centimetres.

07:53.440 --> 07:58.673
Your FBI forensics team can take the plastic
and the chicken wire. We'll take the rest.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.916
Dr Goodman, I wish you wouldn't
just give me to the FBI.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.279
The Jeffersonian must seize every
opportunity to prove our worth to Congress.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.591
I loan you out as I see fit,
especially to federaI agencies.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.195
"Loan out" implies property.
The FBI will never respect it.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.829
You are one of the Jeffersonian's
most valuable assets.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.117
- An asset is property.
- What's the rule, Mr Addy?

08:23.200 --> 08:28.991
You only converse with PhDs. I'm halfway
through two. Two halves make a whole, so...

08:29.080 --> 08:32.789
Go polish a bone, Mr Addy.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.793
Dr Goodman, FBI agents
will never respect any of us

08:36.880 --> 08:41.476
as long as you simply dole out
scientists like office temps.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.390
Dr Brennan... are you playing me?

08:45.480 --> 08:47.755
You know I'm no good at that.

08:47.840 --> 08:53.631
Thus far. But you have
a disturbingly steep learning curve.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.558
The pond is not only warm
and teeming with microbes,

09:04.640 --> 09:07.791
but it houses black carp
and koi which fed on the body.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.395
Can I, as the only normaI
person in this room, say "Ew"?

09:11.480 --> 09:15.189
<i>- I got Trichoptera, Chironomidae...
- As we cut to the chase?</i>

09:15.280 --> 09:17.999
- In the pond two summers.
- Spring before last.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.878
- You really think I'm lusty?
- The book.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.077
- No. You're not in the book.
- Sure he is. We all are.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.628
None of you are in the book...

09:26.720 --> 09:30.713
- I found some bone fragments.
- We're out of the book, back in reaI life.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.916
<i>- Rana temporaria.
- Frog bones?</i>

09:33.000 --> 09:36.276
Also some tiny gold links
as from a fine chain.

09:36.360 --> 09:40.399
Point of clarification: I'm not a virgin.
Nowhere near, in fact.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.596
Who you captured perfectly is Booth.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.752
Buttoned down,
but buckets of sexuaI confidence,

09:45.840 --> 09:48.434
which... I, for one,
would love to tap.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.398
It's not right to discuss
that in front of a soaker.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.349
I can't bounce back and forth between my
book and reaI life. Let's just forget the book.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.955
I haven't analysed what's in her hand.
Looks like cellulose.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.235
- Paper?
- Possibly.

10:02.320 --> 10:07.678
I found grit in the skull fragments.
ID those. Remove the remaining tissue.

10:07.760 --> 10:12.311
I'll debride the skull fragments,
reassemble it so Angela can put a face on it.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.951
Good. I prefer holographs.
They don't stink.

10:17.040 --> 10:21.716
I don't like those terms for human remains -
"soaker", "crispy critter"...

10:21.800 --> 10:23.631
I know, Dr Brennan.

12:01.360 --> 12:06.115
You guaranteed a squint a role in a murder
investigation? The one that wrote the book?

12:06.200 --> 12:08.634
- Yes.
- I thought she wouldn't work with you.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.918
The last case, she provided descriptions
of the murder weapon and murderer.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.230
- I didn't give her much credence.
- Why not?

12:15.320 --> 12:19.996
- She did it by looking at the autopsy x-rays.
- I wouldn't give it much credence either.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.435
She was right on both.
Plus the pond victim.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.911
Brennan gives me the victim's age,
sex and favourite sport.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.479
- Which is?
- Tennis.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.595
She's good.

12:29.680 --> 12:35.755
If the only way to get her back on my side
is to bring her out in the field, I'm willing.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.799
Fine. She's on you.
Out in the field, she's your responsibility.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.519
Yes, sir.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.318
Agh!

13:18.880 --> 13:19.869
Peter?

13:20.680 --> 13:25.276
It's not rationaI to choose
the first day I'm back to reclaim your TV.

13:25.360 --> 13:29.672
- I thought a lot about why we broke up.
- We fought and don't like each other.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.116
We fought because you are
emotionally distant and cold.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.555
But sexually speaking...

13:35.640 --> 13:39.519
You didn't come for your TV.
You came for a booty call. You're leaving.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.433
Your issues are due
to being orphaned so young.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.875
I hate psychology.
You're just horny.

13:44.960 --> 13:51.798
- Do you want to spend your life alone?
- I sure as hell wish I was alone right now.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.031
So, what?
We split the cost of the TV?

13:55.120 --> 13:58.476
<i>Goodbye.</i>

13:58.560 --> 13:59.788
What?

13:59.880 --> 14:03.350
- This is interesting, Angela.
- Good morning.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.510
Does Booth know how this works?

14:05.600 --> 14:08.956
This computer program
which I designed, patent pending,

14:09.040 --> 14:15.434
accepts an array of digitaI input, processes it,
then projects it as a 3-D holographic image.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.353
- You get that?
- The patent-pending part.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.477
Brennan reassembled the skull
and applied markers.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.872
Her skull was damaged.
RaciaI indicators - cheekbone dimensions,

14:25.960 --> 14:28.997
occipitaI measurement -
suggest African-American.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.959
And we have our victim.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.031
Whoa.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.119
I have to admit that's pretty cooI.

14:42.200 --> 14:47.558
Ange, rerun the program
substituting Caucasian values.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.198
- Does she look familiar to anyone?
- No.

14:55.280 --> 14:59.114
- Split the difference. Mixed race.
- Lenny Kravitz or Vanessa Williams?

14:59.200 --> 15:02.510
I don't know what that means.

15:12.640 --> 15:18.795
Angela, reduce tissue depth
over the cheekbones to the jaw line.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.556
<i>- Does anyone recognise her?
- Not me.</i>

15:26.640 --> 15:31.953
- Wait. Is that who I think it is?
- The girI who had the affair with the senator?

15:32.040 --> 15:36.431
Her name's Cleo Louise Eller,
only daughter to Ted and Sharon Eller.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.717
Last seen approximately
9pm, ApriI 6th, 2003,

15:39.800 --> 15:45.193
leaving the Cardio Deluxe Gym on K Street.
She didn't even make it to her car.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.317
- Pretty good memory.
- It's my job to find her.

15:48.400 --> 15:54.919
- Congratulations on your success.
- This isn't exactly the way I wanted it to end.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.155
Cleo Eller is notjust some missing girI.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.471
She's an intern who was
boinking Senator Alan Bethlehem.

16:09.560 --> 16:15.476
I was secondary in the investigation into
her disappearance. We couldn't confirm that.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.835
How did you recognise her?

16:17.920 --> 16:20.992
I recognised her features.
The rest is window dressing.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.072
- Shouldn't he be happier?
- Believe me, I'm happy.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.515
- You seem happy.
- I need this kept quiet.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.114
- Cover-up.
- Paranoid conspiracy theory.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.115
Is it paranoia that Monica Lewinsky
was a KGB-trained sex-agent mole?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.111
Do you do confront the senator?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.270
- Bones...
- Don't call me Bones!

16:38.360 --> 16:41.318
- About you coming out in the field...
- You rat bastard!

16:41.400 --> 16:46.520
The director will create a speciaI unit.
If I line my ducks up, I can head it up.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.272
I think I could be a duck.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.670
We stick to the book.
Cops in the streets, squints in the lab.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.753
In that case, the Jeffersonian
will issue a press release.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.115
You do that, I'm a dead duck.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.752
- What are you trying to do?
- BlackmaiI you.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.637
- BlackmaiI a federaI agent?
- Yes.

17:08.880 --> 17:12.236
- I don't like it.
- You're not supposed to.

17:12.319 --> 17:15.278
Fine, you're in.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.269
- You're certain it's Cleo?
- The profile's dead-on. Age, race...

17:21.359 --> 17:24.396
The timeline fits.
Cleo did play tennis in college.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.792
- Talk to me about the senator.
- Cleo Eller worked for Senator Bethlehem.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.316
- It was reported they were involved.
- We couldn't confirm it.

17:32.400 --> 17:38.953
- He's a hound. Everybody knows that.
- Ken Thompson, Cleo's boyfriend.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.308
Thompson's Bethlehem's aide.
He keeps his calendar.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.119
No way the senator has an affair
he doesn't know about.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.156
No sexuaI relationship, no motive.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.993
- What about the nutcase?
- Oliver Laurier.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.071
- You like him for this?
- He is a stalker.

17:53.160 --> 17:57.392
- What's your first move?
- Tell the Ellers we found their daughter.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.996
It's better to keep this quiet. It's been
two years. What's another few days?

18:02.080 --> 18:05.914
I've come to know the family
pretty well, especially the major.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.117
Two years is a hell of a long time in limbo.

18:09.200 --> 18:14.513
- I'll have the cause of death by this afternoon.
- That's where we'll get started.

18:17.360 --> 18:21.797
Hodgins identified the particulates
in Cleo's skull as rolled steeI,

18:21.880 --> 18:26.396
most likely from a sledge-type hammer.
Also, cement and diatomaceous earth.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.277
- What's that?
- Looks like that.

18:28.360 --> 18:32.478
It's made of prehistoric sea creatures,
used as an insecticide, filtering agent,

18:32.560 --> 18:35.358
cleaning abrasive, ceramics.
Very common.

18:35.440 --> 18:39.433
Diatomaceous earth.
Common or not, it's a clue.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.756
You're positive it's our Cleo?

18:43.840 --> 18:49.551
- We established 22 points of comparison...
- Yes, we're certain.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.519
Did he do it? The senator?

18:53.600 --> 18:55.750
One military man to another.

18:55.840 --> 19:00.755
- We can't discuss the investigation.
- Can you tell us if our daughter suffered?

19:00.840 --> 19:05.231
- Given the state of her skull...
- Cleo never saw it coming.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.955
Thank you.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.600
Could you tell us
what Cleo wore around her neck?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.558
Her father's Bronze Star.

19:14.640 --> 19:20.158
Ted won it in the first Gulf War
and he gave it to her for luck.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.871
- Those people deserve the truth.
- They deserve the kindness of a lie.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.952
- There'll be a report.
- Which they won't read.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.828
- Cleo and her parents weren't even speaking.
- They told you that?

19:36.920 --> 19:41.357
Getting information out of live people
is different than getting it out of bones.

19:41.440 --> 19:45.718
- You have to offer up something of yourself.
- What did you do in the military?

19:45.800 --> 19:50.032
See what you did? You asked a personaI
question without offering anything in return.

19:50.120 --> 19:54.557
Since I'm not a skeleton,
you get zilch. Sorry.

19:54.960 --> 20:00.990
There's stab marks here. Odd markings on
the distaI phalanges. Nothing I've seen before.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.072
- Anxious, depressed and nauseous.
- Take a sick day.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.718
Not me. Cleo Eller.

20:05.800 --> 20:10.078
She was on lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide
and meclizine hydrochloride.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.835
Nausea. Show me those bone fragments.

20:13.920 --> 20:20.553
These aren't frog bones. Cleo was pregnant.
Malleus, incus, stapes - foetaI ear bones.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.551
- She was pregnant.
- Not far along.

20:22.640 --> 20:27.111
- You want to see if we can prove paternity?
- Let's hope there's enough materiaI.

20:27.200 --> 20:32.832
This senator gets an intern pregnant
then murders her when it threatens his career.

20:32.920 --> 20:38.153
- He has the connections to get away with it.
- I hate it when you make paranoia plausible.

20:38.240 --> 20:42.711
This speciaI unit? No way your paI
heads it up unless the powers in charge

20:42.800 --> 20:46.713
are convinced he knows where
his bread is buttered. Either way,

20:46.800 --> 20:50.315
that's where this investigation ends.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.512
Want to get a drink?
Non-topicaI application?

21:17.600 --> 21:20.034
Glug-glug, whoo-hoo!

21:20.920 --> 21:22.672
Come on, sweetie.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.676
What if Booth's right? What if I'm only
good with bones and lousy with people?

21:29.760 --> 21:32.274
- People like you.
- I don't care if men like me.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.715
Interesting leap from people to men.

21:34.800 --> 21:40.477
I hate psychology. My most meaningfuI
relationships are with dead people.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.676
- Who said that?
- It's true.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.150
I understand Cleo, and her bones
are all I've ever seen.

21:46.240 --> 21:50.028
When she was seven, she broke
her wrist, probably falling off a bike.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.476
And two weeks later,
before the cast was even removed,

21:53.560 --> 21:57.553
she got right back on that bike
and broke it all over again.

22:00.200 --> 22:05.194
And when she was being murdered,
she fought back hard, even though...

22:05.280 --> 22:08.875
she was so depressed
she could hardly get up in the morning.

22:08.960 --> 22:13.636
She didn't welcome death.
Cleo wanted to live.

22:13.720 --> 22:19.716
Honey, you ever think maybe you come off
distant because you connect too much?

22:19.800 --> 22:26.717
- I hate psychology. It's a soft science.
- I know. But people are mostly soft.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.675
Except for their bones.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.637
Yeah.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.835
You want some advice?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.638
"Glug-glug, whoo-hoo"?

22:38.600 --> 22:41.876
Offer up a little bit of yourself
every once in a while.

22:41.960 --> 22:47.910
Just... tell somebody something you're not
completely certain you want them to know.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.117
That's the second time
I've received that advice.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.670
Well, you know I give great advice.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.480
I'm gonna have to push this to the next leveI.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.831
Why would the director of the FBI
send you instead of coming himself?

23:06.920 --> 23:10.356
Probably because I found
that Cleo was pregnant.

23:10.440 --> 23:14.115
- You could tell she was pregnant?
- We found foetaI bones.

23:14.200 --> 23:19.399
The only question, Senator,
is which one of you is the father?

23:19.480 --> 23:22.870
Are you willing to submit to a DNA test?

23:23.480 --> 23:28.793
Don't say anything on the subject without
your attorney present. That's my advice.

23:28.880 --> 23:33.158
Advice I intend to take.
Ken, we have a vote to get to.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.035
Uh... What are you doing?

23:40.120 --> 23:45.114
Saliva from gum is a source of DNA.
I'll compare it to the DNA in the foetaI bones.

23:45.200 --> 23:49.557
You need a warrant for that.
Ken, she needs a warrant.

23:51.880 --> 23:56.635
If you have any further questions,
we'll be in touch.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.073
Ken, you OK?

24:02.160 --> 24:08.030
I could place you under arrest on a federaI
charge for uttering threats against a senator.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.314
- What?
- Bones.

24:09.400 --> 24:13.916
- I own her, but she was your responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.470
Send in SpeciaI Agent Furst.
I warned you about squints.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.028
- But you said she wouldn't screw up.
- Yes, sir.

24:20.120 --> 24:25.831
No. Booth didn't know I was going to see the
senator. I wanted to get a sample of his DNA.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.717
- Exactly.
- Not helping.

24:29.840 --> 24:35.039
Tomorrow I'm announcing the formation
of a unit to investigate the murder of Cleo.

24:35.120 --> 24:39.591
Your investigation will be terminated.
You will not head the new unit.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.352
Congratulations, Patrick.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.998
- No hard feelings.
- Right.

24:43.080 --> 24:46.436
- I need the case files in the morning.
- They'll be ready.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.829
Thank you, Agent Furst.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.071
At least she found out that
Bethlehem had sex with Cleo.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.513
I did?

24:53.600 --> 24:57.229
The report said there wasn't enough DNA
to determine paternity.

24:57.320 --> 25:01.199
He didn't want her to take the gum.
He's hiding something.

25:01.280 --> 25:05.034
He didn't know there wasn't enough DNA.

25:05.120 --> 25:10.990
Might I suggest that you go back to your lab,
Dr Brennan, and get used to being there.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.718
Come on, Bones.

25:15.400 --> 25:19.075
- You OK?
- Don't be nice to me after I got you in trouble.

25:19.160 --> 25:24.712
- Your heart was in the right place.
- I'm not a heart person. You vouched for me.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.439
- Forget it.
- You think it was the senator?

25:27.520 --> 25:32.275
He's had sex with interns. He hasn't killed
any of them. Our best bet is the stalker.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.477
You want to check him out?
We can - what do you call it? - roost him?

25:35.560 --> 25:37.790
- Roust.
- Roust.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.917
The murderer snatched
the Bronze Star from her neck.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.437
I got 12 hours before this case is over
and I'm off it. So let's go roust.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.758
Mr Laurier,
we have a warrant to search your...

25:50.840 --> 25:52.956
Don't run, Oliver.

25:54.480 --> 26:00.555
Agent Booth thinks you have something
pertinent to a case he's working on.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.110
You're looking for a Bronze Star?
Like the one Cleo wore?

26:04.200 --> 26:06.919
- Exactly like that one.
- I don't have it.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.595
Sometimes stalkers retain keepsakes.

26:10.680 --> 26:14.036
- What are these things?
- Miniature lives of the saints.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.918
Heads up, Bones.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.154
I hand them out for donations.
I'm not a panhandler. I never stalked Cleo.

26:22.240 --> 26:26.916
- Then why did she get a restraining order?
- OK, no. First of all, no.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.391
Ken Thompson got the restraining order
with his boss, the senator.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.790
Ken is only concerned
with his job and his tropicaI fish.

26:34.880 --> 26:41.228
They colluded to ruin my reputation with this
specious stalker labeI, when in actuality...

26:42.320 --> 26:45.995
- I was Cleo's close friend.
- Why did you run from the warrant?

26:46.080 --> 26:50.232
My fight-or-flight response
is heavily weighted towards flight.

26:50.320 --> 26:55.678
If there's anything I can do to help
you catch Cleo's killer, just tell me.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.638
Full confession.
That would be great.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.678
I loved Cleo.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.354
Why would I hurt her?

27:05.440 --> 27:11.117
- I'm gonna keep one of these little books.
- Whatever you need, Dr Brennan.

27:14.880 --> 27:19.590
- This is a rough composite. You get the idea.
- Skull trauma was not the cause of death.

27:19.680 --> 27:24.435
Cleo was stabbed five to eight times
with a military-issue K-bar knife.

27:24.520 --> 27:30.959
Defensive wounds to her hands suggest it
wasn't till the third or the fourth penetration...

27:31.040 --> 27:35.750
- That's likely the fataI stab right there.
- .. that Cleo stopped fighting back.

27:35.840 --> 27:40.152
The damage to her distaI phalanges,
the tips of her finger bones,

27:40.240 --> 27:45.553
was caused by the murderer using
a knife to remove her finger pads.

27:45.640 --> 27:49.474
CraniaI fragmentation suggests
a 20Ib hammer striking four to five times

27:49.560 --> 27:52.950
while her head rested on a floor
with traces of diatomaceous earth.

27:53.040 --> 27:58.398
That's the best explanation.
This was not a crime of passion.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.519
Cleo never saw the first stab coming.
It didn't arise out of an argument.

28:02.600 --> 28:07.276
Why smash her face? Why whittle away
her fingers? Remove clothing and jewellery?

28:07.360 --> 28:08.509
Sink her body?

28:08.600 --> 28:12.878
He put more effort into hiding her identity
than he did into the murder.

28:12.960 --> 28:19.399
The murderer planted evidence. The book
from the stalker matches the cellulose.

28:19.480 --> 28:24.076
Military cemetery and knife
implicates her father. More misdirection.

28:24.160 --> 28:28.472
Sound like any conniving,
son-of-a-bitch senators you know?

28:28.560 --> 28:31.711
You expect me to declare war on a US senator

28:31.800 --> 28:35.713
based on your little holographic crystaI ball?

28:35.800 --> 28:39.839
It's not magic. It's a logicaI recreation
of events based on evidence.

28:39.920 --> 28:44.038
- No more valid than my gut.
- It's a good hypothesis.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.715
It's not a hypothesis.
You have a dead girI and a US senator.

28:47.800 --> 28:52.555
This is exactly why
squints belong in the lab.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.315
You guys don't know anything
about the reaI world.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.797
Come on. We're done here.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.075
Wow.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.355
Touchy.

29:07.440 --> 29:13.037
You must know about her family.
Both parents vanish when she's 15.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.236
Probably counts as the reaI world.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.756
Yeah, I know the story.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.593
I read the file.

29:21.680 --> 29:25.434
- The cops never found out anything.
- Yeah.

29:25.520 --> 29:31.197
Brennan figures that maybe
somebody like her had been there.

29:31.280 --> 29:36.115
Well, for somebody who hates psychology,
she sure has a lot of it.

29:42.080 --> 29:47.438
I thought I'd find you here. Being a good shot,
doing martiaI arts, is your way of dealing.

29:47.520 --> 29:52.150
Who knows better than you
how fragile life can be?

29:52.240 --> 29:57.872
Maybe an Army Ranger sniper
who became an FBI homicide investigator.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.349
- You looked me up, huh?
- Mm-hm.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.796
- You mind?
- Be my guest.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.871
Thank you.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.600
Were you any good at being a sniper?

30:16.680 --> 30:20.593
A sniper gets to know about killers.
Bethlehem is no killer.

30:20.680 --> 30:24.195
- And Oliver Laurier is?
- The way I read Laurier, he's unhinged.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.510
That makes him dangerous.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.637
That'd be your gut telling you that, correct?

30:29.720 --> 30:33.395
Homicides, they're not solved by scientists.

30:33.480 --> 30:36.870
They're solved by guys like me
asking a thousand questions,

30:36.960 --> 30:40.350
catching people telling lies every time.

30:40.440 --> 30:45.070
You're great at what you do, Bones.
But you don't solve murders.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.549
Cops do.

30:48.640 --> 30:54.397
Cleo Eller was killed on a cement floor
sprinkled with diatomaceous earth.

30:54.480 --> 30:58.598
Traces of her blood will still be
in that cement. One of us is wrong.

30:58.680 --> 30:59.954
Maybe both of us.

31:00.040 --> 31:04.431
But if Bethlehem wasn't a senator, you'd be
in his basement looking for that floor.

31:04.520 --> 31:10.470
You're afraid of him. Your hypothesis is that
squints don't solve murders and cops do.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.676
Prove it.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.432
Be a cop.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.191
Booth.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.670
They look pretty happy, don't they?

32:20.760 --> 32:24.753
Otherwise they wouldn't
turn on the camera, I guess.

32:28.920 --> 32:32.549
Zack said you wanted to see me?

32:32.640 --> 32:36.235
On something you don't
like to talk about - families.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.958
Temperance.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.873
Partners, they... share things.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.512
- It builds trust.
- Since when are we partners?

32:49.040 --> 32:51.759
I apologise for the assumption.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.195
- You got a warrant to search his place?
- You're right.

33:00.280 --> 33:03.829
If Bethlehem wasn't a senator,
I'd be looking for that killing floor.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.789
But you're wrong.
I was never afraid of that guy.

33:08.880 --> 33:13.396
And I'm not doing this
because you're a genius.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.873
I'm doing this for Cleo.

33:39.280 --> 33:43.796
They're searching for blood traces,
a sledgehammer and diatomaceous earth.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.871
What the hell is that?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.790
You're making a big mistake.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.629
.. gun and badge.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.872
I'm in charge. You come in
and mess up my investigation?

34:10.600 --> 34:14.070
<i>Who gave you this warrant?
When was it delivered?</i>

34:14.159 --> 34:17.835
- What are you doing here?
- For all his politics, he's got nothing.

34:17.920 --> 34:23.074
He should've left Cleo properly
like I would've. Will you sign my book?

34:23.159 --> 34:26.311
Stalk me, Oliver,
and I will kick your ass.

34:32.159 --> 34:37.280
I don't recognise that.
That is not mine. That is not mine!

34:42.840 --> 34:45.149
- At least we got the hammer.
- That's all we got.

34:45.239 --> 34:50.313
- Cement floor in the basement?
- But no blood, no diatomaceous earth.

34:50.400 --> 34:57.192
We needed a trifecta, Bones. PhysicaI
evidence, murder weapon, crime scene.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.435
- They wouldn't even arrest him?
- Don't worry.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.432
If that's the hammer used on Cleo,
he'll get arrested.

35:09.520 --> 35:13.399
A toast to getting the murderous bastard.

35:16.720 --> 35:20.793
The hammer's not enough.
He's gonna get away with it.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.997
Maybe Booth is right -
outside the lab, I'm useless.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.914
Let us take guidance
from the lives of the saints.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.470
"Albertus Magnus,
patron saint of scientists. "

35:31.560 --> 35:34.791
I thought Magnus was
the patron saint of fishmongers.

35:34.880 --> 35:38.919
Albertus Magnus was a 13th-century
philosopher. The fishmonger...

35:39.000 --> 35:40.911
Fish!

35:43.560 --> 35:46.836
You said diatomaceous earth
could be used as a filter.

35:46.920 --> 35:49.673
- For swimming pools...
- Or tropicaI fish?

35:49.760 --> 35:53.992
Oliver Laurier said that
Ken Thompson kept fish. I...

35:54.080 --> 35:57.789
- What's your hurry?
- He knows we want diatomaceous earth.

35:57.880 --> 36:02.715
Get in touch with Booth.
Tell him where I'm going, OK?

36:02.800 --> 36:05.917
She didn't actually say
where she was going, did she?

36:16.920 --> 36:19.309
Stop! You can't destroy evidence!

36:27.440 --> 36:30.273
This is a private residence.
Do you have a warrant?

36:30.360 --> 36:35.036
I'm working with the FBI. If I have suspicion
of a crime, I don't need a warrant.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.269
What crime?

36:36.360 --> 36:39.670
Destruction of evidence
pertinent to a federaI investigation.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.876
I'm just cleaning up.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.396
Is that alcohoI I smell on your breath?

36:45.480 --> 36:48.392
This linoleum looks fairly new.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.074
What's underneath? Cement?

36:51.160 --> 36:54.789
The cement embedded in Cleo's skull
when you bashed her head in?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.713
- Get out of here.
- I can't let you destroy evidence.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.677
- How will you stop me?
- I will.

36:59.760 --> 37:04.959
Not before I burn this place down
with you in it.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.840
Argh!

37:08.320 --> 37:10.993
I don't get it.
It wasn'tjealousy or passion.

37:11.080 --> 37:14.516
She wouldn't get rid of your boss's baby,
so you got rid of her.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.273
What a psychology!
What kind of person are you?

37:17.360 --> 37:20.989
Temperance.
Are you all right?

37:21.080 --> 37:24.311
I understand you're here
out of concern for my safety,

37:24.400 --> 37:28.154
but you could be in some kind
of psychotic collusion with Ken.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.755
Go apply pressure to his wound
untiI the police get here.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.910
OK. OK.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.991
- Did he kill Cleo?
- Yeah, he did.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.593
OK.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.309
Then I'm down with him bleeding to death.

37:41.400 --> 37:46.155
That guy dies, Bones will go on triaI
for attempted murder. You don't want that.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.708
I wouldn't want that.

37:48.800 --> 37:53.510
Besides, you know, applying pressure,
that can be very painfuI.

37:59.680 --> 38:03.992
The evidence said he did it,
but... I don't know why.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.356
It doesn't matter.
Motive does not matter.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.557
- He did it to save his job.
- His job?

38:10.640 --> 38:17.113
Senator in a scandaI, he'll lose the Beltway
fast track. It's that simple. It's a tough town.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.435
Yeah, it is a tough town.

38:20.520 --> 38:24.035
In the future,
maybe I should do the shooting.

38:24.120 --> 38:27.032
Why? I'm a good shot.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.711
"Lord, make me an
instrument of your peace. "

38:42.800 --> 38:46.349
"Where there is hatred, let me sow love. "

38:46.440 --> 38:50.115
"Where there is injury, pardon. "

39:13.480 --> 39:16.119
Is the FBI gonna lay charges
against Brennan?

39:16.200 --> 39:18.873
She only shot him in the leg once.

39:18.960 --> 39:23.795
She didn't give him a warning. She just
shot him, with alcohoI on her breath.

39:23.880 --> 39:27.919
It was her first shooting.
You can't expect her to be perfect.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.790
How much warning did you give
people before you sniped them?

39:36.920 --> 39:43.109
"Where there is doubt, faith.
Where there is despair, hope. "

39:43.200 --> 39:46.192
"Where there is darkness, light. "

39:46.280 --> 39:48.669
- What?
- I told you it wasn't the senator.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.478
I told you who it was. We're even.

39:50.560 --> 39:54.872
<i>We're on the same cases and you end up
on the New Y ork Times Bestsellers List.</i>

39:54.960 --> 39:57.758
- I didn't know that.
- Number three, with a bullet.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.877
<i>That's good, right?
The New Y ork Times, or the bullet?</i>

40:00.960 --> 40:03.997
- You're rich. Call your accountant.
- I don't have one.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.036
- Get one.
- How does that work?

40:06.120 --> 40:09.954
You need to get out of the lab.
Watch TV, turn on a radio, anything.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.793
Pick up the phone and...

40:15.040 --> 40:18.271
"Where there is sadness, joy. "

40:18.360 --> 40:24.595
"O Divine Master, grant that I may seek
not so much to be consoled as to console. "

40:24.680 --> 40:27.752
"To be understood as to understand. "

40:27.840 --> 40:31.355
"To be loved as to love. "

40:32.840 --> 40:35.274
You know, if it weren't for you...

40:35.360 --> 40:40.753
those people would never have known
what had happened to their daughter.

40:40.840 --> 40:44.116
That's gotta be worse than the truth.

40:46.520 --> 40:50.229
I know exactly how the
Ellers felt about Cleo.

40:52.040 --> 40:57.672
My parents disappeared when I was 15,
and nobody knows what happened to them.

40:57.760 --> 41:01.116
Being a sniper, I took a lot of lives.

41:01.200 --> 41:07.958
What I'd like to do before I'm done... is
try and catch at least that many murderers.

41:09.720 --> 41:15.238
Please. You don't think there's
some kind of... cosmic balance sheet?

41:22.120 --> 41:24.918
I'd like to help you with that.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.909
Ahh...

42:04.360 --> 42:06.715
