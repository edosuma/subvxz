06:29.555 --> 06:30.890
{\an1}I LOVE THE EPISODE WHERE YOU

06:30.973 --> 06:31.474
{\an1}AND BAGELS

06:31.557 --> 06:32.600
{\an1}PRETENDED TO BE STEWARDESSES

06:32.683 --> 06:33.351
{\an1}TO GET INTO THAT FANCY PARTY.

06:33.434 --> 06:36.062
{\an1}YOU WERE ALL "COFFEE, TEA

06:36.145 --> 06:37.814
{\an1}OR JAIL."

06:37.897 --> 06:38.147
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT WAS

06:38.231 --> 06:40.691
{\an1}COMPLETELY IMPROVISED.

06:40.775 --> 06:40.983
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HELLO.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.445
{\an1}AMANDA CANTWELL. BIG FAN.

06:44.529 --> 06:44.987
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T KNOW

06:45.071 --> 06:45.738
{\an1}WHO SHE WAS.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.405
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.490
{\an1}I LOVED THE EPISODE

06:47.573 --> 06:50.451
{\an1}WHERE YOU WERE ALL "COFFEE, TEA

06:50.535 --> 06:52.662
{\an1}OR JAIL."

06:52.745 --> 06:53.246
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT WAS

06:53.329 --> 06:56.290
{\an1}COMPLETELY IMPROVISED.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.042
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I ALSO LIKED WHEN YOU SAID

06:58.126 --> 06:59.335
{\an1}"THE EXIT ROWS ARE HERE,

06:59.418 --> 07:01.462
{\an1}HERE AND-- POW!"

07:01.546 --> 07:02.755
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T

07:02.839 --> 07:04.298
{\an1}WE GO TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM

07:04.382 --> 07:04.799
{\an1}AND LET THE DESIGNERS

07:04.882 --> 07:06.592
{\an1}SHOW YOU THEIR WORK?

07:06.676 --> 07:07.135
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T NEED TO SEE

07:07.218 --> 07:08.219
{\an1}THEIR WORK.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.347
{\an1}I ONLY NEED TO SEE THEIR AURAS.

07:11.430 --> 07:11.973
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT?

07:12.056 --> 07:13.266
{\an1}SOME SORT OF COOKIE?

07:13.349 --> 07:13.558
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, NO!

07:13.641 --> 07:14.892
{\an1}YOUR AURA IS THE LIGHT

07:14.976 --> 07:18.187
{\an1}THAT RADIATES FROM YOUR SOUL.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.773
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NUT JOB!

07:20.857 --> 07:25.862
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT'S MY AURA LIKE?

07:25.945 --> 07:26.779
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE BATHED

07:26.863 --> 07:28.573
{\an1}IN VIBRANT ORANGE,

07:28.656 --> 07:30.700
{\an1}THE COLOR OF CURIOSITY.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.701
{\an1}YOU'RE ALWAYS

07:31.784 --> 07:32.493
{\an1}QUESTIONING THINGS.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.411
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

07:33.494 --> 07:39.584
{\an1}QUESTIONING HOW?

07:39.667 --> 07:40.543
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

07:40.626 --> 07:41.502
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS IT COLD IN HERE.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.921
{\an1}I'M FEELING A CHILL.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.506
{\an1}IT'S COMING FROM YOU!

07:45.590 --> 07:49.719
{\an1}YOU'RE BATHED IN ICY WHITE.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.430
{\an1}&gt;&gt; A CRISP CLASSIC AURA?

07:52.513 --> 07:53.973
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

07:54.056 --> 07:54.849
{\an1}A TERRIFYING BURST

07:54.932 --> 07:59.145
{\an1}OF BLINDING EVIL.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.606
{\an1}WOULD YOU MIND BACKING UP?

08:01.689 --> 08:07.904
{\an1}A LITTLE MORE, OHH--

08:07.987 --> 08:08.821
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOW ME.

08:08.905 --> 08:09.238
{\an1}ONE TIME, THIS LADY

08:09.322 --> 08:11.324
{\an1}WITH A NOSE RING READ MY PALM,

08:11.407 --> 08:11.824
{\an1}BUT I COULDN'T EVEN

08:11.908 --> 08:12.158
{\an1}PAY ATTENTION

08:12.241 --> 08:12.825
{\an1}BECAUSE SHE HAD

08:12.909 --> 08:13.409
{\an1}BIG OLD BOOGER

08:13.492 --> 08:16.704
{\an1}STUCK IN THE HOOP.

08:16.787 --> 08:17.580
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FEMININE PINK,

08:17.663 --> 08:20.249
{\an1}NURTURING GREEN,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.585
{\an1}FREE THINKING BLUE

08:22.668 --> 08:24.170
{\an1}AND JUST A TINY BIT OF RED

08:24.253 --> 08:25.796
{\an1}TO MATCH YOUR SHOES.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.091
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THESE OLD THINGS.

08:29.175 --> 08:29.675
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE'S OUR NEWEST DESIGNER.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.010
{\an1}SHE'S VERY TALENTED.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.096
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I CAN TELL.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.765
{\an1}AND MY DECISION IS MADE.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.099
{\an1}MY DRESS WILL BE DESIGNED

08:37.183 --> 08:40.144
{\an1}BY TRUE JACKSON.

08:40.227 --> 08:40.770
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FOR REAL!

08:40.852 --> 08:41.395
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THERE MUST BE

08:41.479 --> 08:41.938
{\an1}SOME SORT OF A MISTAKE.

08:42.020 --> 08:42.563
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PLEASE, BACK UP.

08:42.647 --> 08:48.778
{\an1}I'M FREEZING.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.195
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AMANDA, CAN I ASK

08:49.278 --> 08:49.612
{\an1}YOU A FAVOR?

08:49.695 --> 08:51.447
{\an1}HEY, IT IS COLD IN HERE.

08:51.530 --> 08:54.408
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, WHAT IS IT?

08:54.492 --> 08:55.034
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I WAS HOPING

08:55.117 --> 08:55.451
{\an1}YOU COULD HELP ME

08:55.534 --> 08:56.285
{\an1}WITH INVESTING.

08:56.369 --> 08:56.911
{\an1}THIS IS MY FIRST JOB

08:56.994 --> 08:57.745
{\an1}AND I WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE

08:57.828 --> 08:58.663
{\an1}WITH MY MONEY.

08:58.746 --> 08:58.913
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.707
{\an1}LET'S SEE YOUR PAYCHECK.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.376
{\an1}OKAY, IT'S NOT MUCH,

09:03.459 --> 09:05.211
{\an1}BUT WITH THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS

09:05.294 --> 09:05.836
{\an1}I THINK WE CAN DOUBLE IT

09:05.920 --> 09:07.255
{\an1}IN NO TIME.

09:07.338 --> 09:07.838
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNEW WE WERE TALKING

09:07.922 --> 09:08.548
{\an1}ABOUT GAMBLING.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.675
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S NOT GAMBLING.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.678
{\an1}I'M TALKING ABOUT STOCKS.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.136
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE BUYING

09:14.220 --> 09:16.055
{\an1}A LITTLE TINY PIECE OF A COMPANY

09:16.138 --> 09:16.931
{\an1}AND IF THEY MAKE MONEY

09:17.014 --> 09:17.682
{\an1}YOU MAKE MONEY.

09:17.765 --> 09:18.641
{\an1}THERE'S NOTHING RANDOM ABOUT IT.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.558
{\an1}HERE,

09:19.642 --> 09:22.562
{\an1}LOOK AT THIS LIST OF COMPANIES.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.106
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS ONE.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.567
{\an1}GLARTOK.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.902
{\an1}THAT'S A FUNNY NAME.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.238
{\an1}I'LL INVEST IN THAT ONE.

09:32.321 --> 09:32.822
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

09:32.905 --> 09:34.156
{\an1}WHAT THEY MAKE.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.617
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEY MAKE ME SMILE.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.160
{\an1}PUT IT ALL IN AND LET IT RIDE.

09:38.244 --> 09:46.711
{\an1}MAMMA NEEDS A NEW PAIR OF SHOES.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.254
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY JENNA!

09:48.337 --> 09:49.380
{\an1}I LOVED THE EPISODE

09:49.463 --> 09:49.839
{\an1}WHERE YOU AND BAGELS

09:49.922 --> 09:50.172
{\an1}HAD TO PRETEND

09:50.256 --> 09:51.299
{\an1}TO BE GEISHA GIRLS

09:51.382 --> 09:52.967
{\an1}TO BUST THAT COUNTERFEIT RING.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.927
{\an1}YOU WERE ALL "TEHEEE.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.305
{\an1}YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!"

09:57.388 --> 09:59.181
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I LOVE IT.

09:59.265 --> 09:59.682
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THANK GOODNESS.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.474
{\an1}I WAS AFRAID

10:00.558 --> 10:00.933
{\an1}YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.226
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT LIKE IT?

10:02.310 --> 10:02.643
{\an1}IT'S PERFECT.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.020
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GREAT.

10:04.103 --> 10:04.979
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GREAT.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.480
{\an1}WHAT IF IT WERE GREEN?

10:06.564 --> 10:06.856
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT, GREEN?

10:06.939 --> 10:08.607
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GREAT.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.860
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UM, I GUESS

10:10.943 --> 10:12.445
{\an1}IT COULD BE GREEN.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.237
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'D BE SO PERFECT.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.698
{\an1}EXACTLY LIKE THIS, BUT IN GREEN.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.158
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND RUFFLES.

10:17.241 --> 10:17.950
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RUFFLES?

10:18.034 --> 10:18.576
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T YOU THINK.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.162
{\an1}I LOVE RUFFLES AND SPARKLES.

10:21.245 --> 10:21.620
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO SAID ANYTHING

10:21.704 --> 10:23.122
{\an1}ABOUT SPARKLES?

10:23.205 --> 10:23.372
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL,

10:23.456 --> 10:24.540
{\an1}IT'S GOTTA HAVE SPARKLES, RIGHT?

10:24.623 --> 10:27.543
{\an1}I MEAN, IT'S A DRESS.

10:27.626 --> 10:28.586
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, NO JENNA.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.212
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK, I TOTALLY GET IT.

10:30.296 --> 10:30.629
{\an1}THIS IS YOUR DESIGN.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.715
{\an1}I SHOULD GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE

10:32.798 --> 10:34.633
{\an1}IF I WANT SPARKLES.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.051
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NICE MEETING YOU.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.635
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE CAN DO SPARKLES.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.763
{\an1}ANYTHING ELSE?

10:38.846 --> 10:39.180
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT.

10:39.263 --> 10:46.604
{\an1}I TOLD YOU, IT'S PERFECT.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.396
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK, MAYBE SHE KNOWS

10:47.480 --> 10:48.105
{\an1}WHAT SHE'S DOING.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.857
{\an1}I MEAN, SHE IS A GREAT ACTRESS.

10:49.940 --> 10:50.608
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.150
{\an1}WHEN I SAW SPOOKY ASYLUM,

10:51.233 --> 10:52.234
{\an1}I REALLY BELIEVED

10:52.318 --> 10:53.152
{\an1}SHE WAS A MENTAL PATIENT.

10:53.235 --> 10:53.527
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M STARTING

10:53.611 --> 10:54.653
{\an1}TO BELIEVE THAT NOW.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.114
{\an1}BUT IT'LL PROBABLY BE OKAY.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.367
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I GOT ANOTHER IDEA.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.037
{\an1}BIG SHINY BUTTONS.

11:03.120 --> 11:09.085
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GREAT.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.127
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, AMANDA.

11:10.211 --> 11:10.753
{\an1}HOW DID I DO IN MY BET?

11:10.836 --> 11:14.090
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN YOUR INVESTMENT

11:14.173 --> 11:15.591
{\an1}IN GLARTOK.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.051
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT NAME

11:17.134 --> 11:19.804
{\an1}JUST DOESN'T GET OLD.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.722
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, LET'S JUST SEE

11:21.806 --> 11:24.266
{\an1}HOW YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR--

11:24.350 --> 11:25.101
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GLARTOK WAS BOUGHT BY

11:25.184 --> 11:26.727
{\an1}JARMAK INDUSTRIES.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.103
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS THAT BAD?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.480
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ONLY IF YOU HATE MONEY.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.108
{\an1}THE STOCK PRICE HAS TRIPLED.

11:32.191 --> 11:32.692
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DID I HEAR YOU BOUGHT

11:32.775 --> 11:33.401
{\an1}GLARTOCK

11:33.484 --> 11:35.111
{\an1}BEFORE THE MERGER?

11:35.194 --> 11:38.656
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IMPRESSIVE.

11:38.739 --> 11:39.615
{\an1}SO, HOW IS IT GOING

11:39.698 --> 11:42.618

12:03.514 --> 12:04.056
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY'RE DOING ARRIVALS.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.099
{\an1}&gt;&gt; POPCORN?

12:05.182 --> 12:08.853
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NAH, I'M TOO NERVOUS TO EAT.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.855
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HI, I'M KITTY MONROE,

12:21.949 --> 12:25.619

12:25.703 --> 12:26.287
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HOPE THAT KITTY MONROE

12:26.370 --> 12:27.204
{\an1}LIKES MY DRESS.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.581
{\an1}I MADE A LOT OF CHANGES

12:28.664 --> 12:29.457
{\an1}TO IT.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.416
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RELAX.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.584
{\an1}I'M SURE SHE'LL LOVE IT.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.127
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND LOOK WHO'S ARRIVED--

12:33.210 --> 12:34.587
{\an1}JENNA LUTRELL.

12:34.670 --> 12:34.920
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS IS IT.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.756
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JENNA, YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL

12:37.840 --> 12:38.841
{\an1}AND SO TALENTED.

12:38.924 --> 12:39.592
{\an1}WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE

12:39.675 --> 12:40.009
{\an1}NO ONE WILL PUT YOU

12:40.092 --> 12:42.887
{\an1}IN A FILM?

12:42.970 --> 12:44.221
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN OFFERED

12:44.305 --> 12:44.680
{\an1}MANY FILM ROLES,

12:44.763 --> 12:45.806
{\an1}BUT I'M A LITTLE BUSY

12:45.890 --> 12:48.392
