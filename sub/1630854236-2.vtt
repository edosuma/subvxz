WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:07.298
Liam.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.259
Liam!

00:09.300 --> 00:11.511
(grunts)

00:11.553 --> 00:12.804
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.472
Look, look at me,
hey, take it easy.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.349
-Take it easy.
No, no, no... don't move.
-I'm fine.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.892
-I'm fine, I'm fine, Cord.
-Hey.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.227
-I'm fine.
-Okay,

00:19.269 --> 00:22.022
what happened?
Wh-Wh-Why are you here?

00:22.772 --> 00:24.399
They f-- they found me.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.278
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
-They...

00:28.319 --> 00:30.864
-(groans)
-(muffled shouting)

00:31.865 --> 00:34.576
Okay, okay, uh...

00:34.617 --> 00:36.828
What about the kids? Mama?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.371
They're all right.
Everybody's okay.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.665
We're just looking...
looking for you.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.208
(Walker exhales)

00:42.250 --> 00:44.502
Do you remember the Mitchells?
They-they got a trail cam

00:44.544 --> 00:47.964
-of the plates of the van
that took you, so... Hey.
-Okay.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.841
The cavalry should be coming.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.092
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.552
That's great. We just got to...

00:52.594 --> 00:55.472
(exhales) We got to
just hang tight, you know?

00:55.513 --> 00:57.348
-Cordell.
-Yeah?

00:57.390 --> 01:00.769
What? What aren't
you telling me?

01:01.102 --> 01:04.856
Hey, you tell me.
You tell me right now.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.233
We are gonna get
out of this together.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.652
You're not gonna pull
some Walker Lone Ranger

01:09.694 --> 01:11.738
-and risk yourself for me.
-Liam...

01:11.780 --> 01:12.864
Hey.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.240
Listen to me.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.159
Promise me.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.787
Promise me.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.127
I promise.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.552
(exhales)

01:34.594 --> 01:36.846
♪ ♪

01:41.392 --> 01:43.937
-How old was he here?
-Three.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.772
He tried to eat
the whole thing by himself,

01:45.814 --> 01:47.899
then smashed it when I

01:47.941 --> 01:50.902
-tried to take a slice.
-Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

01:50.944 --> 01:52.278
Hey, what's going on here?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.864
Just trying to find
a recent photo of Cordi.

01:54.906 --> 01:55.949
Hmm.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.909
HQ has an official

01:57.951 --> 01:59.744
Ranger photo of him.
You know that, right?

01:59.786 --> 02:03.081
Oh, we know.
It's just so serious.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.425
That's the first time
he went away from home.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.303
Wasn't even 21 yet.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.847
It's the first time

02:18.888 --> 02:22.058
I didn't know
whether he'd be back.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.144
Hey.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.938
He's coming back home.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.155
ABELINE: Honey, why don't
you get some rest?

02:35.196 --> 02:38.533
(sighs) Cattle collar tore.
I need to fix it.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.785
Now's the appropriate time?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.579
Yes, Abs, now,

02:42.620 --> 02:43.955
'cause there's absolutely

02:43.997 --> 02:46.457
nothing that I can do
at this very moment.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.043
(clattering in drawer)

02:57.927 --> 02:59.053
(phone rings)

02:59.095 --> 03:00.597
CASSIE:
Great, yeah, looks good.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.432
All right, take that,
follow that, appreciate it.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.309
-MAN: Okay.
-(phone ringing)
-JAMES: Cassie. A word.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.560
Yes, one second.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.313
Hey, bro, what's up?
Can't talk right now.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.064
Hey, I wouldn't be
calling you at work

03:10.106 --> 03:12.483
if this wasn't important,
but, um, have you seen Liam?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.110
We were supposed to meet
this morning.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.737
(stammers)
Have you called, texted?

03:15.778 --> 03:17.155
Yeah, of course, Cass.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.324
I haven't heard from him.
I think his phone's off.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.284
Wait, wait, wait, what,
his phone is off?

03:21.326 --> 03:24.245
Yeah. This isn't like him. I'm
driving around looking for him.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.831
I know he and I
are just starting out,

03:26.873 --> 03:28.208
but with Walker's kidnapping
and now this,

03:28.249 --> 03:29.834
I care about him,
and-and the thought of...

03:29.876 --> 03:33.338
I know, just don't worry.
Call you back.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.340
(sighs)

03:41.721 --> 03:44.015
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt,

03:44.057 --> 03:46.142
but I think Liam Walker
is missing, too.

03:46.184 --> 03:46.726
What? No.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.020
Yeah, he was supposed
to meet my brother

03:49.062 --> 03:50.605
but didn't show, and now
he's not answering his cell.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.024
When's the last time
he was seen or heard from?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.193
Um, I was with him
yesterday at the ranch,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.445
-but I'm not sure after that.
-Hi, you've reached
Liam Walker...

03:57.487 --> 03:59.697
-Damn it.
This can't be happening.
-(line rings)

03:59.739 --> 04:03.117
-Hi, you're reached
Liam Walker...
-It's straight to voice mail.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.037
Should we tell the family?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.041
We're gonna have to.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.460
Damn it.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.462
(sighs)

04:21.761 --> 04:23.054
All right, everybody, listen up.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.306
Besides Ranger Walker...

04:27.475 --> 04:30.228
...his brother Liam Walker
is missing now, too.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.771
(all murmuring)

04:31.813 --> 04:33.648
Whoever did this

04:33.690 --> 04:35.400
has not only attacked us,

04:35.441 --> 04:37.443
but now they're coming
after our families,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.404
and that...

04:39.445 --> 04:40.905
that cannot stand.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.824
We are not gonna rest

04:42.865 --> 04:44.784
until we find them,
you understand me?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.244
(murmuring in agreement)

04:46.286 --> 04:49.372
Clock is ticking.
Let's bring 'em home.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.923
All right, we were able
to render the photo.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.925
The van that took Walker?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.176
We got a plate,
but it's bogus.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.304
(sighs)
Well, no shocker there.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.596
(muttering)

05:05.638 --> 05:08.099
Wait a second.

05:09.684 --> 05:13.313
-What's up?
-This is a manifest
of all the fake plates

05:13.354 --> 05:16.190
made at the chop shop
Miles was investigating.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.694
Uh-huh. This van plate's
one of them.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.696
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.157
Let me go talk to Miles.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.368
Perez, we've been through this.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.954
Maybe he knows more about
whoever was driving the van.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.331
No, Miles told us
everything he knew.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.957
Because we weren't asking
the right questions.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.292
Come on, Cap.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.793
I'll coordinate
with the Marshals.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.129
I'll see if I can
get you access. Okay?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.089
Oh, that-that could take
a couple of weeks.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.799
He's still in transitional
holding.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.926
-Let me go down there...
-Perez, no!

05:43.968 --> 05:45.470
They're putting him
in WITSEC for a reason.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.721
What are you gonna do?
You gonna charge down there

05:46.763 --> 05:48.097
unannounced, out of protocol?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.349
No, it's just gonna
make things harder.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.850
We don't need the Feds
hassling us.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.811
Listen, I want to find him, too.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.105
We got to do it the right way.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.986
(James sighs)

06:02.028 --> 06:04.447
Look, I got to...
I got to deal with this.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.866
I will handle Miles,

06:06.908 --> 06:09.911
you focus on the current leads.
Are we clear?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.211
(indistinct radio transmission)

06:23.633 --> 06:25.843
Stella Blue.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.136
How you holding up?

06:27.178 --> 06:30.932
Okay, given the circumstances.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.937
We're doing everything we can.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.563
-All right?
-I know.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.691
That's, um...
That's kind of why I'm here.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.569
-What do you mean?
-I want to help.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.363
Like, actually help.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.323
Look, Stella, I got
everybody on this, okay?

06:47.365 --> 06:48.866
So the best thing
you can do right now...

06:48.908 --> 06:50.743
Look, Captain,
I have to do something.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.370
I can't just sit around anymore.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.455
So either you can
let me help here,

06:54.497 --> 06:56.332
or I'm going to search
every alley

06:56.374 --> 06:58.876
and knock on every door
until I find him.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.714
You are your father's daughter.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.385
Look, your dad would kill me
if I let you

07:07.427 --> 07:10.888
wander the streets
searching alleys.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.100
Okay? But I've even got
my dispatchers pounding

07:14.142 --> 07:15.685
the pavement on this,
so if you really want to help,

07:15.726 --> 07:18.229
this phone has a dedicated line
for any information

07:18.271 --> 07:20.773
coming in about
the disappearance. Okay?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.900
You answer it,
follow the prompt,

07:22.942 --> 07:24.569
take down the message,
give it to a Ranger.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.029
Well, actually,
I thought that...

07:27.071 --> 07:29.365
Please, please, I get it.
I understand. It's in your DNA.

07:29.407 --> 07:33.411
But please, just...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.079
answer the phone.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.833
All right?

07:54.599 --> 07:56.267
Why-why did they unchain you?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.603
I don't know.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.522
Mind games probably.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.901
You know, treat us well,
get us comfortable,

08:04.942 --> 08:07.320
then break us.
(weak chuckle)

08:07.361 --> 08:08.779
Do you think that's
what happened

08:08.821 --> 08:10.656
to the, the woman
that you mentioned?

08:10.698 --> 08:13.367
Julia.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.078
Well, I hope not.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.998
How do you know
she wasn't broken

08:19.040 --> 08:20.666
and on their side now?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.960
No, it wouldn't make any sense.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.795
I mean, she had no reason
to help me.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.964
I didn't give her anything.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.884
But that's probably
what they're betting on.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.136
That I would doubt her.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.847
Or, hell, that I'll doubt you
right now.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.891
You don't think...

08:36.933 --> 08:38.809
No, no. No, no, no, no.
I'm saying,

08:38.851 --> 08:40.853
all we have right now,

08:40.895 --> 08:43.481
all we can have is our gut.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.529
My gut tells me that she
is on our side.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.197
(door opens)

08:51.239 --> 08:53.074
And that you're my brother.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.076
(door creaks open)

08:58.496 --> 09:01.541
That's for him.
You have other dinner plans.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.880
(Walker clears throat)

09:16.722 --> 09:18.474
(Walker grunting)

09:21.227 --> 09:24.814
Please eat. Eat.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.703
Thank you.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.917
But I'm stuffed.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.963
What do you want?

09:49.005 --> 09:52.133
We could really use
a guy like you.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.176
I mean, an ally
with the Texas Rangers...

09:54.218 --> 09:56.887
So-so what? So I can end up
like Captain Cole?

09:56.929 --> 09:59.724
(scoffs)
Scared into swallowing cyanide?

09:59.765 --> 10:02.518
Fenton Cole was
a disappointment.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.645
You are different.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.689
You are a man who,
when he sees a problem,

10:06.731 --> 10:07.982
he takes care of it.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.484
Just look at all
of the corruption

10:10.526 --> 10:12.528
that you have personally
stopped.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.239
D.A. McLawson,
Commissioner Stan Morrison,

10:15.281 --> 10:16.490
D.A. Davidson.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.160
So clearly you have
enough reach

10:19.201 --> 10:21.245
to have done your
opposition research on me.

10:21.287 --> 10:25.875
So tell me, what
in that big old file of yours

10:25.916 --> 10:28.252
makes you think
that I'll turn?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.630
(chuckles)
Because you are,

10:30.671 --> 10:32.798
as your former partner
described,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.343
"edge of the coin
Cordell Walker."

10:35.384 --> 10:37.845
A man not afraid
to make the hard choice.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.513
So what's the hard choice here?

10:39.555 --> 10:43.809
Blowing it all up?
(laughs)

10:43.851 --> 10:45.102
Okay, I'll give it to you.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.773
There are some flaws
in the system,

10:48.814 --> 10:52.151
but there are good people
making strides

10:52.193 --> 10:54.570
to fill those cracks.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.534
Is that how you describe
your wife?

11:01.869 --> 11:04.497
She died at the hands
of an organization

11:04.538 --> 11:06.332
that you serve.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.876
How does that work?

11:09.835 --> 11:13.422
Even after all
of your strides,

11:13.464 --> 11:15.716
you will never get her back.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.847
The same could be said
about joining you.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.935
You could save
the next widower.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.108
You're a hypocrite.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.402
All this talk of corruption.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.405
You murder people
who are in your way

11:37.446 --> 11:38.823
or who don't comply.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.827
To me, it sounds like
you're a terrorist.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.036
(chuckles)

11:44.078 --> 11:46.622
You can call it
what you want.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.084
It is all necessary
to trigger change.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.047
You still haven't told me
what you want.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.174
It's simple.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.177
We are anarchists.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.179
We want to create a power

12:10.104 --> 12:11.689

give me your name

16:08.509 --> 16:10.344
and tell me what you know?

16:10.386 --> 16:12.179
I saw them.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.514
I'm sorry, you saw who?

16:13.555 --> 16:15.432
I saw them take him.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.810
Inside, I mean.
Really tall, right?

16:17.851 --> 16:21.605
Yes. Can you tell me
what my da...

16:21.647 --> 16:24.274
Can you tell me what
the Ranger was wearing?

16:24.316 --> 16:27.069
Uh, dark shirt, shorts,

16:27.111 --> 16:29.071
and sneakers,
like running shoes.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.952
Sorry, maybe calling
was a mistake.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.537
No, no, please.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.122
Can you give me your name?

Shannon. I don't want
to give my last name,

-if that's okay.
-That's fine, Shannon.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.920
Can you tell me exactly
where you saw them?

a reward?

16:49.299 --> 16:52.386
Like money or something?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.471
It-it seems like
there should be.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.974
I mean, he is a Texas Ranger.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.768
That's got to be worth
something.

have called.

17:01.895 --> 17:02.688

17:02.730 --> 17:05.899
Yes, there is a reward.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.986
I thought so.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.946
How much?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.709
Thanks for doing this.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.252
Eh, it's kind my job.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.088
I know, but if I wasn't
your brother,

17:28.130 --> 17:30.466
I know I probably wouldn't
get to ride along.

I appreciate it,
you sticking by me.

Can you go get it?

18:13.509 --> 18:14.551
Okay,

18:14.593 --> 18:16.386
you trashed your room,

18:16.428 --> 18:18.013
you're yelling at me,
which for you

18:18.055 --> 18:19.765
is not normal at all,

18:19.807 --> 18:21.266
and you're asking for money.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.572

gonna help find Dad,

of the importance

19:41.138 --> 19:42.472
of interagency cooperation?

19:42.514 --> 19:45.100
Oh, no, sir, I just
thought that...

19:45.142 --> 19:46.560
Yeah, save it, Marshal.

you were investigating.

that you forgot to tell us

20:40.072 --> 20:41.073
or didn't mention?

20:41.114 --> 20:42.616
Like names, other locations?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.493
No. I-I put everything
in the statement. It was...

at all you forgot to tell us.

there was this little thing,

it was relevant.

-Uh, uh...
-Hey!

she ignored it.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.054
-Okay.
-Later she said that
she felt weird about it

21:04.096 --> 21:05.764

the reporter was

She said she was on assignment.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.738
Okay, so she's telling work
she's on family leave.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.574
She's telling her family
she's on a work assignment.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.742

34:16.220 --> 34:18.056
(alarm sounds)

34:19.599 --> 34:21.684
DISPATCHER:
219, 219. Over.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.978
-Go for James.
-Yes, sir. About

34:24.020 --> 34:25.897
the abandoned hospital
you requested us to check out?

34:25.938 --> 34:27.482
There's heavy activity.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.566
The place appearing
to be operational,

34:28.608 --> 34:30.026
multiple armed personnel. Over?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.695
Have all Rangers converge
on that location.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.531
Everyone on site should be
considered extremely hostile.

34:35.573 --> 34:36.783
Copy. Over.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.744
(tires squealing)

34:39.786 --> 34:41.871
(alarm sounding)

34:45.583 --> 34:47.293
I'm gonna need those back,
Ranger.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.505
(panting)

34:50.546 --> 34:52.882
Walk back slowly.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.096
Go! Go! Let's get out of here!

34:58.137 --> 35:00.556
(grunting)

35:15.154 --> 35:18.866
(both grunting)

35:28.960 --> 35:31.129
(both yelling)

35:31.170 --> 35:33.339
-(bones crack)
-(screams)

35:55.736 --> 35:57.822
♪ ♪

36:14.172 --> 36:16.465
(Liam groans)

36:20.178 --> 36:21.679
It's them. Run!

36:22.638 --> 36:23.764
Go! Aah!

36:23.806 --> 36:25.516
(tires squealing)

36:33.816 --> 36:37.111
No, no, no. Wait. Please.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.322
(two gunshots)

36:44.952 --> 36:46.537
Put the gun down!

36:46.579 --> 36:48.414
Put it down!

36:57.632 --> 36:59.133
Walker!

37:05.890 --> 37:07.975
Sean.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.938
It's over.

37:11.979 --> 37:14.023
Oh, I know.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.359
But I don't feel like I've lost.

37:22.365 --> 37:26.494
Until Valhalla, Marine.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.544
You guys okay?

37:35.586 --> 37:37.088
Yeah.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.048
Where's Cordi?

37:40.758 --> 37:42.593
(explosion)

37:46.514 --> 37:48.349
Cordi!

38:06.659 --> 38:09.078
(sirens approaching)

38:12.790 --> 38:16.085
Wasn't lying, was I, Stinker?

38:17.795 --> 38:20.047
(both muttering)

38:23.551 --> 38:27.513
Hey, thank you
for all your help in there.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.391
I'm Cordell Walker,
Texas Ranger.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.311
-Julia. Julia...
-Oh, uh...

38:33.352 --> 38:35.354
-(laughing): ...uh, Johnson.
-Yeah.

38:35.396 --> 38:40.026
Cap, you may want to, um,
call a hazmat team.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.486
I left 'em a present
in Radiology.

38:42.528 --> 38:45.531
Wouldn't be Cordell Walker
if you didn't.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.037
-What took you so long?
-I could circle the airport

38:51.078 --> 38:52.705
again if you want.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.167
Got your back.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.085
I know. I know.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.505
You... promised.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.636
(Walker inhales sharply,
exhales)

39:07.678 --> 39:10.598
All right, partner.
What you need?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.559
I need to hug my kids.
