<i>- Cheers.
- Yeah. Hear, hear.</i>

00:38.554 --> 00:42.314
<i>Jane! Wait!</i>

00:44.060 --> 00:46.063
<i>Nina.</i>

00:46.095 --> 00:47.564
<i>Nina? Nina, talk to me.</i>

01:11.989 --> 01:14.490
- Just stay put, Maura.
- No, it's superficial.

01:14.524 --> 01:16.960
- The EMT's on the way. Let's make sure.
- Kent needs my help.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.629
What are we looking at?

01:19.662 --> 01:23.900
- I got this.
- No, I'm fine.

01:23.933 --> 01:25.536
It appears to be
a through and through

01:25.569 --> 01:27.204
with entry just below the clavicle.

01:27.236 --> 01:28.121
Now if the bullet shattered

01:28.122 --> 01:29.974
- the clavicle, then obviously...
- Any movement will sever the subclavian artery.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.508
Okay, you apply pressure.

01:31.540 --> 01:34.878
I will immobilize her arm in
case she regains consciousness.

01:41.984 --> 01:44.221
Damn it! Come on.

01:48.558 --> 01:49.927
Clear.

01:49.959 --> 01:53.997
- Clear.
- Clear.

02:05.275 --> 02:08.645
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
No way.

02:08.679 --> 02:10.213
You go up that ladder,
you're a sitting duck.

02:10.247 --> 02:11.916
If she's waiting for you
behind one of those windows,

02:11.949 --> 02:13.384
she's gonna shoot before
you ever see her.

02:13.417 --> 02:14.985
What are we supposed to do, let her go?

02:15.018 --> 02:16.152
No, you're supposed to not
get yourself killed

02:16.186 --> 02:18.656
while we're chasing her.
Come on, Jane.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.060
Yeah, this is Detective Frank Rizzoli.

02:23.092 --> 02:25.128
<i>I need a 6-block lockdown,
door-to-door</i>

02:25.162 --> 02:27.998

02:56.759 --> 02:59.562
- She okay?
- She's stabilized.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.164
<i>She's gonna need surgery.</i>

03:01.198 --> 03:04.301
- Did you find that shooter?
- No.

03:04.334 --> 03:06.437
Jane, Maura suffered a...

03:06.469 --> 03:08.572
<i>Suffered a what? 
Hey!</i>

03:16.747 --> 03:18.015
Ma.

03:18.048 --> 03:19.984
- Wha... Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

03:20.016 --> 03:22.501
- Startled. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.454
- Frankie?
- He's fine.

03:24.487 --> 03:28.024
- Go check Maura.
- Yeah, okay.

03:29.325 --> 03:31.027
Hey. Kent said that you...
you suffered something.

03:31.061 --> 03:33.597
- What happened?
- I cut my head.

03:33.629 --> 03:35.132
Okay, the end of that sentence

03:35.164 --> 03:36.265
was not "Maura suffered
a cut on the head."

03:36.299 --> 03:37.501
- What happened?
- Possible concussion.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.402
I got a possible concussion
and I cut my head.

03:39.436 --> 03:42.306
- What about the shooter?
- We lost her on the fire escape.

03:42.338 --> 03:45.609
- So you got a good look at her?
- No, but it was Alice Sands.

03:45.641 --> 03:49.013
- How do you know?
- Because she burnt down my apartment

03:49.045 --> 03:51.048
and she kidnapped Maura.
What, it's somebody else?

03:51.080 --> 03:52.750
I don't know, but I'm trying
to build a case.

03:52.782 --> 03:54.722
- Well, how could it...
- I-I think you could both benefit from

03:54.779 --> 03:58.572
- some tactical breathing. 1, 2, 3...
- Okay, you need to go to the hospital.

03:58.607 --> 04:00.123
I'm gonna get a uniform
to take you there, all right?

04:00.158 --> 04:02.158
No, no, no, I'm going to the hospital.
I'm gonna check on Nina,

04:02.192 --> 04:03.760
and I will call you
if there are any updates.

04:03.794 --> 04:05.695
- Okay?
- Okay.

04:05.729 --> 04:08.465
- How big a perimeter did you set up?
- Six blocks.

04:08.497 --> 04:10.500
Look, why don't you stay here
and take care of Kiki, okay?

04:10.533 --> 04:12.536
I'll call you when I get
the investigation moving.

04:21.077 --> 04:22.645
You got a glove?

04:22.678 --> 04:25.826
Thanks.

04:27.516 --> 04:30.353
All right, this is a crime scene.

04:30.387 --> 04:34.124
Nobody touches this
unless Dr. Isles says so.

04:42.766 --> 04:44.735
Any word from the hospital?

04:44.767 --> 04:47.470
Yeah, Nina's out of surgery.
She's doing fine.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.840
- Oh, she was lucky.
- How so?

04:49.872 --> 04:53.576
You were the target.
If Sands had been aiming at her...

04:54.877 --> 04:57.146
Yeah, I'm still here.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.550
- You see all the reporters at the front door?
- Yeah, I saw 'em.

04:59.583 --> 05:02.286
They didn't see me, though.
I took the back entrance.

05:02.319 --> 05:06.122
"Wedding Bells Ring.
Shooter Flees. BPD Fails."

05:07.723 --> 05:09.293
Your poetry sucks.

05:09.326 --> 05:11.395
Hmm. It's the headlines
of one of their stories.

05:11.427 --> 05:15.598
W... Okay, we haven't failed.
We just haven't succeeded yet.

05:15.632 --> 05:17.567
How many apartments
are there left to search?

05:17.600 --> 05:21.305
- Not many.
- All right, thanks.

05:21.338 --> 05:23.140
<i>Well, the driver of the truck
was interviewed.</i>

05:23.173 --> 05:27.111
He received an electronic dispatch
from Ingersoll, Ontario,

05:27.144 --> 05:28.846
telling him to drive the truck
from Canada

05:28.879 --> 05:31.814
- and leave it where we found it.
- And he didn't think that was strange?

05:31.848 --> 05:34.785
Yeah, but he said he's paid
for driving, not thinking.

05:34.817 --> 05:36.120
Did he actually say that?

05:36.153 --> 05:38.655
- Yep.
- Wow.

05:38.687 --> 05:42.459
- You ruling him out?
- Well, he's got no criminal record.

05:42.492 --> 05:45.528
The Mounties searched his house
and his bank records

05:45.562 --> 05:48.365
and didn't find anything indicating
involvement in a drug ring.

05:48.398 --> 05:51.869
And after he dropped off
the truck, he went bowling.

05:51.901 --> 05:54.737
So he's too boring to be involved.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.341
That's what I'm thinking.

05:57.674 --> 06:01.278
So how did she get away from us?

06:01.310 --> 06:02.745
She still might be
in one of those apartments.

06:02.778 --> 06:04.548
Yeah, but you know
she isn't gonna sit still.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.751
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

06:07.783 --> 06:09.887
but I didn't find anything
in the shooter's truck.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.256
No fingerprints except for the driver's.
No unusual fibers.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.826
Police Academy made Alice Sands
a good criminal.

06:15.858 --> 06:19.930
I sent the tape from the box
she traveled in to MIT.

06:19.963 --> 06:24.501
I'm wondering if trace amounts of DNA...

06:24.533 --> 06:27.737
from her breath might have stuck
to the adhesive.

06:29.206 --> 06:33.776
- Okay.
- So they're... going to...

06:33.810 --> 06:35.778
What?

06:35.812 --> 06:39.783
- Call an ambulance.
- They're gonna call an amb...

06:39.815 --> 06:41.884
- Maura!
- Maura.

06:56.483 --> 06:59.052
- I'm fine.
- Is she fine?

07:00.319 --> 07:02.322
If you don't tell her, I'll have
to, and she won't believe me.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.091
So please, you'd be doing me a favor.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.461
My preliminary examination
indicates a concussion.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.430
But it's unusual for someone
to lose consciousness

07:09.463 --> 07:13.334
that long after the injury,
so I'm giving her a CAT scan.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.103
We'll re-evaluate
after we get those results.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.406
- And we're going to the CAT scan now?
- I have an appointment. Later.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.475
And... we can wait
because she's fine?

07:22.509 --> 07:25.397
Well, she needs to rest,
which means limited physical

07:25.398 --> 07:27.548
- and mental activity.
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.583
<i>Code blue, OR 3.
Code blue, OR 3.</i>

07:29.615 --> 07:32.019
So none of you can answer
a direct question?

07:32.052 --> 07:34.321
What she just said was perfectly clear.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.490
Okay. I'm taking you home.
Thank you.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.193
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

07:39.225 --> 07:42.062
- I wanna go back to the office.
- No.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.998
My CAT scan is not scheduled
till tomorrow,

07:44.031 --> 07:45.699
so I'm not just gonna
sit around and wait.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.629
I wanna help find Alice Sands.
And anyway,

07:47.664 --> 07:49.569
I'd rather be at BPD where
you can keep an eye on me.

07:49.603 --> 07:53.307
If you don't take it easy,
I'm gonna have you arrested.

07:53.339 --> 07:57.010
- On what charges?
- Failure to... listen to me.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.012
Clinical stubborn...
I-I don't know.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.727
I'll think of something.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.052
Here's what we got.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.222
We know Alice Sands
is the sole shareholder

08:08.254 --> 08:09.622
of New Brunswick Woodworks.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.458
<i>And now we've tied New Brunswick</i>

08:11.490 --> 08:14.127
to several other companies that
are doing cross-border business.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.428
What took so long?

08:15.461 --> 08:18.164
Well, Nina was in the middle
of working on it

08:18.197 --> 08:20.166
when... she went to the wedding.

08:20.199 --> 08:23.269
Did we get the info to
the Canadian drug authorities?

08:23.302 --> 08:26.273
Yeah. And the DEA.
We're tightening the noose.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.808
On her businesses.
We're nowhere on finding her.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.212
- Did they finish the search?
- All six blocks, every room,

08:32.212 --> 08:35.448
every rooftop. Didn't find her.
Nobody saw her.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.350
She's not in any of the video
we pulled. She's vanished.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.086
Well, it pisses me off.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.524
- I'll be back in five.
- All right.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.629
Hi. I-I didn't wanna come upstairs.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.799
I didn't know what I'd be
getting in the middle of.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.951
- How's Mimi?
- Oh, she was drunk enough

08:54.952 --> 08:58.373
that some of the chaos eluded her.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.476
I'm glad everyone's okay...
or will be okay.

09:03.509 --> 09:07.814
- Me, too.
- Well, at least they'll remember it.

09:07.847 --> 09:11.284
Hmm.
Well...

09:11.317 --> 09:13.821
I-I know. I know you need to go.
I just...

09:13.854 --> 09:15.522
I wanted to see you.

09:15.554 --> 09:21.527
- Thanks. I'll call you later.
- Oh. Okay.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.439
<i>Dr. James, call cardiac care.</i>

09:32.471 --> 09:35.341
<i>Dr. James, call cardiac care.</i>

09:39.778 --> 09:44.250
- Hey.
- There you are.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.186
Whoa, whoa.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.621
Easy. Easy. Lie down.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.790
There's been a lot of poking
and prodding and stitching up.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.727
All I remember is the rice.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.496
It wasn't my rice, I promise.

09:56.529 --> 10:02.401
- How you feel?
- Like my bruises have bruises.

10:03.636 --> 10:09.475
- Is everyone else okay?
- Yeah. Everyone's okay.

10:09.509 --> 10:13.447
Well, the non-cop guests are
a little freaked out, but...

10:13.480 --> 10:18.251
- Nicole?
- Probably wishes I hadn't invited her.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.889
Did we catch Alice Sands?

10:21.922 --> 10:26.627
Not yet.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.698
- What are you working on?
- Alice is hiding somewhere.

10:32.731 --> 10:35.401
I'm trying to figure out where
and if anyone's helping her.

10:35.434 --> 10:38.204
Okay.
What do you know so far?

10:43.509 --> 10:48.415
All right, so...
I got a banker and a lawyer

10:48.416 --> 10:50.951
<i>who signed off on documents...</i>

11:03.330 --> 11:04.965
Ah. Ah, ah.
Where are you going?

11:04.998 --> 11:08.435
To that drawer to get a red pen.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.605
I did walk in here under my own power.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.575
Yeah, well, that wouldn't have
been my choice,

11:14.607 --> 11:16.943
and now you're under my care, so...

11:16.976 --> 11:18.812
- There.
- You are not my doctor.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.814
No, I am not your doctor, but
I am someone who could call

11:21.815 --> 11:24.784
Detective Rizzoli and tell her
you're not looking very well,

11:24.817 --> 11:29.405
which would rain down a heap of
hellish goodwill upon your head.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.729
Can you get that printout for me?

11:35.761 --> 11:37.796
Yep.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.704
Why are you printing out
an evidence inventory?

11:44.738 --> 11:48.008
Well, I couldn't find pictures of the
alley from the night of the shooting,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.710
so I thought
I might look through the log

11:49.743 --> 11:51.812
and see if somebody might have
mislabeled the files.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.913
But the alley wasn't
part of the crime scene.

11:53.947 --> 11:57.583
I mean, the police locked it
down to do a quick search, but...

11:57.616 --> 12:00.920
<i>Ah. We didn't send
a crime scene unit there.</i>

12:00.953 --> 12:04.557
Alice is smart.
Maybe she just made it seem like

12:04.591 --> 12:06.326
she disappeared into that building.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.629
We need to get a CSRU
team there immediately.

12:09.663 --> 12:12.533
I'm on it.

12:19.773 --> 12:24.344
- I got nothin'.
- Then you're way ahead of me.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.613
People don't just disappear.
They leave trails.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.516
Forensic trails, paper trails.

12:29.548 --> 12:32.485
- She's good.
- Yeah, well, she's not better than us.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.788
Not forever, no. But this time,
looks like she got away.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.691
We just have to hope
she didn't run too far.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.693
- I'm just being honest.
- You read Maura's psych profile.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.528
She's not gonna quit
until she's beat me.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.531
Profiles are just educated guesses.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.067
As hard as it is to believe,
Maura could be wrong.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.802
She's not wrong.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.773
Alice went to Canada to try and fool us.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.740
She snuck back to try and surprise us.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.711
This is all part of her plan,
and it failed.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.315
So now she's gotta figure out
her next move.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.318
She's not gonna run...

13:05.351 --> 13:08.355
because I'm not gonna let her.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.994
- Detective Rizzoli!
<i>- What can you tell us?</i>

13:14.027 --> 13:15.829
All right, as you know,

13:15.861 --> 13:19.665
our BPD analyst, Nina Holiday,
was shot yesterday.

13:19.698 --> 13:23.402
We do have a suspect.
It's a woman named Alice Sands.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.706
She's a convicted drug dealer.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.674
She's also a police academy dropout.

13:28.707 --> 13:33.379
I have nothing further to add at
this time, except it's clear that

13:33.413 --> 13:35.948
she wasn't good enough
to be a part of BPD.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.951
<i>So it's just a matter of time</i>

13:37.984 --> 13:41.655
<i>before we find her
and bring her to justice.</i>

13:41.687 --> 13:43.889
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:49.191 --> 13:51.727
So... stubborn!

13:51.760 --> 13:53.230
You are the best cop I know,

13:53.263 --> 13:55.132
but sometimes you do
the stupidest things!

13:55.164 --> 13:57.166
- Well, we all have our gifts.
- Well, why not just put

13:57.167 --> 13:59.303
a target on your chest
and walk down the street?!

13:59.335 --> 14:02.573
- I had to draw her out.
- You undermined the chain of command

14:02.605 --> 14:05.341
and put yourself in a position
to get suspended or fired!

14:05.374 --> 14:06.743
Well, that's better than
letting her get away!

14:06.776 --> 14:09.346
Oh, you make it so hard
for me to defend you!

14:09.379 --> 14:12.181
Vince, I don't want you
to get in trouble.

14:12.215 --> 14:17.321
- Oh, well, it's a little late for that.
- I can't...

14:17.354 --> 14:19.123
We can't let her hurt anybody else.

14:19.156 --> 14:22.692
- What?!
- Nina and I found something.

14:22.725 --> 14:24.460
- Nina's back?
- Not exactly.

14:24.494 --> 14:27.480
A-anyway, Joe Harris, the
prison shrink, was on the payroll

14:27.481 --> 14:30.466
of a consulting firm that
we've tied to Alice's companies.

14:30.499 --> 14:31.768
We need to talk to every employee

14:31.801 --> 14:33.436
- of that consulting firm.
- I'll take care of that.

14:33.470 --> 14:35.471
- You gotta go downtown.
- I do?

14:35.504 --> 14:39.209
Yeah.
 The chief wants to talk to you.

14:39.241 --> 14:44.180
- Keep me posted, please.
- I will... if I'm allowed to!

14:46.182 --> 14:49.252
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

14:49.253 --> 14:52.890
Well...
I tried to make Vince feel better,

14:52.922 --> 14:57.193
but I clearly made him feel worse.
And now I feel bad.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.929
Yeah.
Can't make them feel better.

14:59.962 --> 15:03.366
I've learned after all these years...

15:03.399 --> 15:07.504
Well, I just keep my mouth shut
and listen.

15:07.537 --> 15:10.574
Well... it's not
particularly comforting.

15:12.676 --> 15:14.645
Yeah.
Yeah, you'll get the hang of it.

15:14.677 --> 15:18.481
Yeah.
How's Ron doing?

15:18.514 --> 15:21.651
Well, he was, uh,
calm doctor guy at the scene

15:21.685 --> 15:24.922
until his daughter called.
She'd seen him on the news.

15:24.955 --> 15:26.889
Oof. That couldn't have been good.

15:26.922 --> 15:30.294
- Probably not.
- Mm.

15:30.326 --> 15:33.462
I mean, it's one thing
for me to deal with it,

15:33.495 --> 15:37.201
maybe an okay choice for him.

15:37.234 --> 15:39.436
But how far can it trickle down

15:39.469 --> 15:42.873
until the effects of this job aren't okay?

15:42.906 --> 15:46.410
<i>♪ 'Cause loving you, it hurts so good ♪</i>

15:46.442 --> 15:48.811
So how's the honeymoon going?

15:48.845 --> 15:51.882
<i>♪ Like splitting wood ♪</i>

15:51.914 --> 15:53.749
<i>♪ Like splitting wood ♪</i>

15:54.083 --> 15:56.619
<i>♪ Like splitting wood ♪</i>

15:56.653 --> 15:59.256
- What are you doing?
- Hoping I didn't miss something.

15:59.288 --> 16:01.424
This?
Not "taking it easy."

16:01.457 --> 16:03.826
Well, I've never done
so little work at the office.

16:03.859 --> 16:05.962
- So you feel better?
- Yes.

16:05.995 --> 16:08.631
- Lying.
- I feel good enough to help.

16:08.664 --> 16:11.467
It'd be nice
if you found something,

16:11.500 --> 16:14.337
help everybody forget
how mad they are at me.

16:14.370 --> 16:15.972
- The impromptu press conference?
- Mm-hmm.

16:16.005 --> 16:20.444
The chief of police seems to
think that I'm not camera-friendly.

16:20.476 --> 16:23.580
- Or just friendly. I don't know.
- You are plenty friendly.

16:23.613 --> 16:25.549
- Thank you.
- Most of the time.

16:25.581 --> 16:26.350
Okay.

16:26.383 --> 16:30.387
So MIT's test on the packing tape
was inconclusive.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.855
I've run every analysis
I can think of,

16:31.888 --> 16:34.291
and all the materials in the van
turned up nothing.

16:34.324 --> 16:36.727
I don't have a single bit
of physical evidence

16:36.759 --> 16:39.328
to identify Alice Sands,
or anyone else.

16:39.361 --> 16:41.998
So we can't prove that she's
connected with the shooting?

16:42.032 --> 16:43.499
No.

16:43.532 --> 16:46.302
So even if we find her,
we can't arrest her.

16:46.335 --> 16:50.874
No. But I did send a
CSRU team back to examine

16:50.907 --> 16:54.578
every step of her escape route,
especially the alleyway.

16:54.610 --> 16:58.347
All we need is a hair, a cell,
a drop of blood.

16:58.380 --> 17:01.017
We'll find something.

17:01.051 --> 17:04.488
I like your optimism.

17:11.661 --> 17:13.529
Joe Harris had financial problems.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.464
He was a month or two
from filing for bankruptcy

17:15.498 --> 17:16.900
when Alice arrived at the prison.

17:16.932 --> 17:18.555
- She saved his ass.
- Yeah.

17:18.567 --> 17:20.770
Did he know the contract
and the money came from Alice?

17:20.804 --> 17:22.993
- Unclear.
- He did.

17:23.029 --> 17:26.375
She's like a spider,
luring people into her web.

17:26.409 --> 17:28.745
She saves him, makes him think
that she loves him.

17:28.778 --> 17:31.647
Eventually, he loves her back.
He'll do anything for her.

17:31.681 --> 17:33.883
Burn down my apartment.
Kidnap Maura.

17:33.916 --> 17:36.052
- Die.
- Oh.

17:36.085 --> 17:37.870
If Alice is so
charismatic, I can't believe

17:37.871 --> 17:39.655
you don't remember her from the academy.

17:39.689 --> 17:42.058
I think she was too busy
hating me to try to be friends.

17:42.092 --> 17:44.928
A lot of people feel that way.

17:48.864 --> 17:50.666
Hey, Maura.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.768
CSRU finished their
investigation of the alley.

17:52.801 --> 17:54.937
- Okay. What'd they find?
- Nothing.

17:54.970 --> 17:57.574
Alice's DNA isn't on
the fire escape ladder.

17:57.606 --> 18:00.476
<i>There's no smudged fingerprints,
like she wiped it down.</i>

18:00.509 --> 18:02.612
And more importantly,
there's no disturbance

18:02.644 --> 18:05.081
in any of the dusty surfaces
on the higher rungs.

18:05.114 --> 18:07.517
So she didn't go up the ladder.

18:07.549 --> 18:11.821
No. Our theory of how Alice
got away is wrong.

18:15.991 --> 18:18.662
Maybe she didn't make it this far.

18:18.694 --> 18:19.962
We didn't see her on the street.

18:19.996 --> 18:21.465
I mean, there's no place else
she could've gone.

18:21.498 --> 18:25.969
- We searched all these buildings.
- Then we missed her.

18:29.706 --> 18:31.842
Hey.

18:33.509 --> 18:35.412
What if she didn't go up?

18:39.149 --> 18:42.119
She went down.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.496
Hey. Find anything?

18:52.531 --> 18:54.691
No. We went into the sewer
about a hundred yards

18:54.725 --> 18:56.761
and eventually lost the footprints.

18:56.794 --> 18:58.963
And then the tunnels split off
into three different directions,

18:58.996 --> 19:00.430
so should could be anywhere.

19:00.463 --> 19:03.133
You smell bad.

19:03.167 --> 19:05.670
- Don't go there.
- Mm.

19:05.702 --> 19:08.372
From where she climbed in, she
could be anywhere in the city.

19:08.405 --> 19:09.973
Mm-hmm. It's the perfect way
to move drugs around.

19:10.007 --> 19:13.111
- No wonder she was never caught.
- Mm.

19:13.143 --> 19:15.512
- Hey.
- Uh...

19:15.545 --> 19:17.715
- You smell less than fresh.
- Mm. What?!

19:17.748 --> 19:20.418
- You were gonna say something.
- Maybe.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.853
What did
the Department of Works say?

19:21.885 --> 19:23.787
Well, apparently, hundreds
of people live in the tunnels.

19:23.821 --> 19:25.690
Rousting them
is not a budgetary priority,

19:25.722 --> 19:27.057
but sometimes when they're
doing construction,

19:27.091 --> 19:31.062
- the police clear 'em out.
- You have a twinkle in your eye.

19:31.094 --> 19:33.530
A couple days ago, a guy ran
when he should have listened.

19:33.564 --> 19:35.466
Cops saw him dumping
white powder down the runoff.

19:35.498 --> 19:36.834
They couldn't recover it,

19:36.866 --> 19:38.435
so they couldn't arrest him
for possession, but...

19:38.468 --> 19:39.737
Do we know where he is?

19:39.769 --> 19:41.138
I have someone bringing
him in right now.

19:41.171 --> 19:43.440
Yes!

19:54.584 --> 19:56.187
Sorry. We're not open.

19:56.219 --> 19:59.556
- Joann.
- Angela.

20:00.924 --> 20:02.626
How you doing?

20:02.660 --> 20:08.199
Well, I guess not bad.
You know, considering.

20:08.231 --> 20:11.468
Yeah.
My dad said you were very brave.

20:11.501 --> 20:15.539
- Yeah, well, Ron's a little biased.
- Yeah.

20:15.573 --> 20:17.675
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

20:17.708 --> 20:20.945
No. Actually, I, uh,
I gotta go pick up the kids.

20:20.978 --> 20:23.147
- So...
- Oh.

20:25.216 --> 20:30.488
- How are you doing?
- I...

20:30.520 --> 20:34.858
I know this is, uh, really hard.

20:34.891 --> 20:37.661
Yeah. Well,
that's an understatement.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.697
Yes.

20:41.030 --> 20:45.436
My daughter was sitting with me
when I saw him on TV.

20:46.970 --> 20:50.074
Her brother found her
in her room this morning, crying.

20:50.106 --> 20:53.543
He... He made her a police car
out of LEGOs and said,

20:53.576 --> 20:57.714
"I'll keep Grandpa safe."
He's 5, Angela.

20:57.747 --> 21:00.584
He's not supposed to be thinking
about things like that.

21:00.618 --> 21:03.821
No, he's not.
I'm so sorry, Joann.

21:03.853 --> 21:05.957
I mean, my dad could've been shot.

21:05.989 --> 21:08.258
He... or... or... or worse.
My God.

21:08.292 --> 21:13.547
- I know.
- I don't know why I came here.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.233
I-I don't... I don't know w...

21:15.266 --> 21:17.701
what I expect you to say. I just...

21:18.701 --> 21:23.975
I'm sorry. I...
You've got work to do.

21:35.686 --> 21:38.555
Three strikes you're out, Isaac.

21:38.588 --> 21:42.779
Look, I get loyalty, okay?
But Alice Sands isn't gonna

21:42.780 --> 21:45.662
bake you cookies
while you rot upstate for 40 years.

21:45.696 --> 21:47.899
She can't help you.
We can help you...

21:47.931 --> 21:50.601
if you give us information
that helps us find her.

21:50.633 --> 21:52.870
I don't know where she is.

21:52.902 --> 21:55.139
Tell us how Alice is using the tunnels.

21:55.171 --> 21:58.543
We can get you gentle time.
We can get you less time.

21:58.575 --> 22:00.978
You won't do squat, and you know it.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.080
Fine. We tried nice.

22:04.113 --> 22:07.017
Now let's try naked.
Get your clothes off.

22:07.051 --> 22:07.852
- What?
- What?

22:07.884 --> 22:10.954
Isaac Weston, you are under
arrest for being an accessory

22:10.955 --> 22:14.025
after the fact in the
shooting of a BPD employee.

22:14.057 --> 22:17.740
I'll get you a jumpsuit.
You give me your clothes.

22:18.595 --> 22:20.064
Now!

22:22.065 --> 22:26.379
She also isn't gonna bake you cookies.

22:33.177 --> 22:35.846
I really don't need
to be pushed to the door.

22:35.879 --> 22:38.916
Nobody does. That means you're
leaving at the right time.

22:38.949 --> 22:40.817
Really? It's embarrassing.

22:40.851 --> 22:43.054
Nothing I can do.

22:43.086 --> 22:47.091
- Hey. Uh, can I do this?
- All yours.

22:47.123 --> 22:49.611
- Just got more embarrassing.
- Oh, come on.

22:49.646 --> 22:51.595
I'd let you push me out of the hospital.

22:51.629 --> 22:53.064
Shouldn't you be at work?

22:53.096 --> 22:56.132
Well, technically, helping
a colleague is a work function.

22:56.166 --> 22:59.737
Besides, I don't have anything
pressing going on right now.

22:59.769 --> 23:03.207
- I don't believe you.
- Are all patients this ornery?

23:03.239 --> 23:04.842
The food makes them angry.

23:04.874 --> 23:08.641
Well, we'll stop for a burger.

23:14.284 --> 23:16.353
- Where's Kent?
- Oh. The test on the drug

23:16.386 --> 23:18.088
runner's clothes are still in process.

23:18.122 --> 23:21.324
No, I'm not asking you.
You're supposed to be taking it easy.

23:21.357 --> 23:23.960
I am taking it easy.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.667
Yeah?

23:29.699 --> 23:31.235
Where are we on the tests
on the clothes?

23:31.267 --> 23:34.738
- Uh, in process. Hey.
- Hey.

23:34.772 --> 23:39.176
- The bell was his idea.
- So you're just sitting here.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.379
The furthest I've gone
is the ladies' room.

23:41.411 --> 23:43.780
That's very unstubborn of you.

23:43.814 --> 23:45.382
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:45.416 --> 23:48.319
- You still have a headache?
- I'm drinking Chinese skullcap tea.

23:48.352 --> 23:51.421
Can you just...
answer a direct question?

23:51.455 --> 23:53.257
I'm dealing with it.

23:53.289 --> 23:56.227
All right.
Please call me if you need anything.

23:56.259 --> 23:58.061
- Of course.
- Okay.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.069
Still in process.

24:05.102 --> 24:08.139
After you get the results from the...

24:08.171 --> 24:11.642
from... the...

24:13.209 --> 24:16.583
- The mass spectrometer?
- Yes.

24:16.618 --> 24:20.183
Yeah, um, make sure to check
the calibration.

24:20.217 --> 24:23.255
Yeah, of course. Will do.

24:27.324 --> 24:29.459
Mass spectrometer.

24:31.061 --> 24:33.764
Mass spectrometer.

24:33.796 --> 24:35.365
<i>Mass spectrometer.</i>

24:42.784 --> 24:44.252
She gives us food, clothes.

24:44.285 --> 24:46.254
I don't have anything bad
to say about her.

24:46.287 --> 24:48.355
That's because you don't
know her very well.

24:48.388 --> 24:49.490
She's dangerous,

24:49.523 --> 24:51.258
and we need to find her
before she hurts somebody else.

24:51.291 --> 24:53.060
- Says you.
- Why don't we let the courts

24:53.094 --> 24:54.429
decide whether she's a saint
or a sinner?

24:54.461 --> 24:56.163
We just wanna know how to find her.

24:56.196 --> 24:59.100
- I don't know.
- When was the last time you saw her?

25:00.268 --> 25:02.237
It's been a while.

25:02.269 --> 25:04.471
The officers that found you two
in the tunnels

25:04.505 --> 25:06.374
said you were pretty well set up.

25:06.406 --> 25:08.809
I'm sure you don't want us to be
bothering you all the time.

25:08.843 --> 25:11.745
- Don't you guys have better things to do?
- We do.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.347
<i>Detective Rizzoli?</i>

25:13.381 --> 25:16.651
- Yeah.
- Alice says "Hello."

25:31.432 --> 25:34.109
You tell Alice to go to hell.

25:35.470 --> 25:37.172
Jane.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.811
<i>I assume you're familiar
with the machine.</i>

25:43.845 --> 25:45.646
Yes. I was on
the advisory committee

25:45.680 --> 25:48.549
when they did the revisions
for the exposure standards.

25:48.583 --> 25:50.384
I meant you know
that you just lay down

25:50.417 --> 25:53.855
- and hold your breath when I ask you to.
- Of course. That, too.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.557
<i>It won't take long.</i>

25:56.590 --> 26:00.227
- Climb on up.
- Okay. Well, thank you for getting me in early.

26:00.260 --> 26:05.500
When the chief of staff says this is
a priority, I assume it's a priority.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.693
Hey. I'm, uh, I'm just
confirming the results.

26:32.727 --> 26:35.563
They should be on Dr. Isles'
desk in about 10 minutes.

26:35.596 --> 26:37.432
I called her.
She didn't answer.

26:37.464 --> 26:40.367
That's just information, right?
That's not a question?

26:40.401 --> 26:44.239
- Where is she?
- Uh, she said she had an appointment.

26:44.271 --> 26:47.375
- When did she leave?
- About an hour and a half ago?

26:47.407 --> 26:49.176
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

26:49.210 --> 26:51.312
- Why not?
- To be fair,

26:51.345 --> 26:53.280
I didn't think it was
any of my business.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.384
She suffered a head injury yesterday.

26:56.416 --> 26:59.301
Everything she does is your business.

27:00.954 --> 27:05.383
- Now that we got that clear...
- Jane.

27:05.660 --> 27:08.560
Shit.

27:17.404 --> 27:21.576
Hey! What a nice surprise.

27:22.809 --> 27:26.647
I hope I'm not interrupting
some life-saving procedure.

27:26.681 --> 27:27.749
Just finished rounds.

27:27.781 --> 27:30.651
The, uh, med students were
all thoroughly confused.

27:30.684 --> 27:34.227
I think we helped everyone by stopping.

27:34.454 --> 27:37.791
- Not ready to smile yet?
- Sorry.

27:37.825 --> 27:40.929
- It was funny.
- Mm.

27:40.961 --> 27:45.699
- So what's going on?
- Um, I wanna talk to you.

27:45.732 --> 27:49.803
Uh, I'm free in 20 minutes.
You wanna go to the cafeteria?

27:49.836 --> 27:54.275
I... I can't wait.

27:54.307 --> 27:57.979
Okay. Um...

27:58.011 --> 28:00.948
<i>Dr. Williams, call intensive care.</i>

28:00.981 --> 28:02.716
<i>Dr. Williams, intensive care.</i>

28:02.750 --> 28:06.354
The shooting, it's, uh,

28:06.386 --> 28:10.224
brought a lot of things
into perspective for me.

28:10.258 --> 28:13.194
I get that.

28:17.265 --> 28:21.282
- I have to break up with you.
- What?

28:21.317 --> 28:25.873
I have to focus on my children
and making sure they're okay.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.842
So do you. And...

28:28.875 --> 28:33.714
I know this comes as a surprise...

28:35.348 --> 28:37.451
but it's the right thing to do.

28:37.484 --> 28:40.420
No! No, it isn't. I...

28:40.453 --> 28:42.589
You're in shock, Angela. You...

28:42.623 --> 28:45.759
- I've made up my mind.
- Just... I got shot at yesterday.

28:45.792 --> 28:49.496
- I know.
- Yeah, your friend's wedding.

28:49.529 --> 28:52.043
- Yes.
- All I'm asking is

28:52.044 --> 28:54.535
that you take some
time to let all this...

28:54.567 --> 28:57.571
sink in so that we
can talk about things.

28:57.605 --> 29:01.302
I'm sorry, Ron,
but I've made up my mind.

29:03.711 --> 29:07.648
I need to write up my reports.

29:21.095 --> 29:23.298
Shouldn't you be
recuperating somewhere?

29:23.330 --> 29:26.217
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I've been shot.

29:26.218 --> 29:29.537
- It feels shitty, not fine.
- Thank you for saying that.

29:29.569 --> 29:31.705
It was hurting just to sit up
straight and breathe.

29:31.739 --> 29:34.375
Then what are you doing here?

29:34.407 --> 29:37.344
I just...

29:37.377 --> 29:39.780
I remember how I felt
after my fiancé was shot.

29:39.814 --> 29:44.318
Powerless, scared.
I don't wanna feel like that again.

29:44.352 --> 29:46.454
So you wanna find the person
who shot you?

29:46.487 --> 29:47.889
More than anything.

29:47.922 --> 29:50.557
You promise to go home
when the pain gets too much?

29:50.590 --> 29:55.329
- Promise.
- Let's get started.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.732
This is what we know.

30:03.403 --> 30:06.073
Yeah, do you need anything?
A snack? Water? Anything like that?

30:06.106 --> 30:08.108
No, thank you, and you don't
need to be getting me snacks.

30:08.142 --> 30:09.911
Ah. Right. Yeah.

30:09.943 --> 30:12.446
It's just that Detective Rizzoli
thinks I'm not taking

30:12.480 --> 30:14.481
my caregiving responsibilities
seriously enough.

30:14.515 --> 30:17.684
- Ah. Well, she worries.
- Well, she's right.

30:17.718 --> 30:21.689
When I ran away from being a doctor,
I think I ran a little bit too far.

30:21.721 --> 30:25.093
I guess I could be a bit more...
empathetic.

30:25.125 --> 30:28.829
- Couldn't we all?
- You're very empathetic.

30:28.863 --> 30:30.865
People have used a lot of words
to describe me.

30:30.897 --> 30:33.400
I'm not sure that was ever one of them.

30:33.433 --> 30:35.502
Yeah, well, they don't
know you, do they?

30:35.536 --> 30:40.041
But I do sometimes wonder what
kind of a doctor I would have been.

30:40.074 --> 30:43.567
- I mean, to live people.
- A great one.

30:43.602 --> 30:46.981
Brilliant even,
if somewhat overdressed.

30:49.150 --> 30:51.786
Anyway, is that why you rang me?

30:51.818 --> 30:55.405
No. No, I have, um, I've been
thinking that you have been

30:55.406 --> 30:58.993
here a while now, a lot longer
than we originally planned.

30:59.026 --> 31:01.729
Yeah, well, God bless Wilkins
for needing a new kidney.

31:01.761 --> 31:03.498
So I think you need
more responsibilities.

31:03.530 --> 31:05.599
Perhaps a raise to go along with it.

31:05.633 --> 31:08.068
So we can talk about it
in the days to come.

31:08.102 --> 31:09.670
Wow.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.772
Uh, I mean, it's not like
I haven't thought about it.

31:11.806 --> 31:13.673
I've got all these ideas and...

31:13.707 --> 31:16.177
Okay.
So shall we have lunch on Monday?

31:16.210 --> 31:17.912
Yeah.

31:18.979 --> 31:22.591
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.859
I mean, I get it. She's angry.
She's frustrated.

31:32.893 --> 31:36.663
But it's not enough that Nina got shot?

31:36.696 --> 31:39.466
The note was a location for a meeting.
Clearly a setup.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.568
No rational person...
certainly no cop...

31:41.602 --> 31:43.504
is gonna fall into a trap like that.

31:43.537 --> 31:46.173
But why not just take the note
and walk away?

31:46.207 --> 31:47.809
Why fan the fire?

31:47.842 --> 31:51.713
I don't know
why it bothers me so much.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.915
I guess...

31:56.750 --> 31:58.885
I know I'm going to retire.

31:58.919 --> 32:01.689
Someday.
Not too far in the future.

32:01.721 --> 32:04.192
And Jane's gonna work another
10 or 15 years at least.

32:04.224 --> 32:07.160
What if her next partner isn't as...

32:07.193 --> 32:11.932
- You love her.
- Yes. I...

32:14.134 --> 32:15.702
Yes.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.941
But I can only control
the things I control, right?

32:19.973 --> 32:23.711
- Yeah.
- Right now I-I have to do my job.

32:23.743 --> 32:27.214
I just have to do my job
and help Jane find Alice Sands.

32:27.248 --> 32:30.131
- Thank you.
- Mm.

32:30.166 --> 32:31.952
Aren't I lucky to have married
the smartest woman in the world?

32:31.986 --> 32:34.904
Yes.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.525
<i>Later.</i>

32:39.993 --> 32:43.663
Okay, her note said for me
to meet her here,

32:43.696 --> 32:47.968
which means I can be ambushed
from here, here, or here.

32:48.001 --> 32:50.203
Also gives Alice an escape route
through this tunnel,

32:50.237 --> 32:53.074
that access door, this steam vent.

32:53.106 --> 32:55.142
She picked this area.
It's because she's familiar with it.

32:55.174 --> 32:59.113
Maybe, but the drug runner was
picked up near Columbia Road.

32:59.145 --> 33:03.217
- That's nowhere near here.
- And she's too smart to draw all of BPD

33:03.250 --> 33:05.852
into the part of the tunnels
that she's using for her organization.

33:05.885 --> 33:08.122
You think she really expects you
to meet her?

33:08.154 --> 33:10.090
No.

33:10.124 --> 33:13.928
No, I think that she needs
to regroup, and she's hoping

33:13.961 --> 33:15.762
that we waste some time
playing out this thread.

33:15.796 --> 33:17.914
So we ignore the note
and start looking for her

33:17.915 --> 33:19.966
- around Columbia Road.
- Focus on sections of the system

33:20.000 --> 33:21.868
that were built
in the early 20th century.

33:21.902 --> 33:24.572
- Where have you been?
- I had an appointment.

33:24.605 --> 33:26.574
I will tell you about it later,

33:26.606 --> 33:29.743
because the mass spectrometer indicates

33:29.777 --> 33:31.612
that the clothes you brought me
from the drug runner

33:31.644 --> 33:33.780
were dusted with clay, shale, iron...

33:33.814 --> 33:36.017
<i>all by-products
of the soft mud process,</i>

33:36.049 --> 33:38.786
which is how bricks were made
before steam machinery.

33:38.818 --> 33:43.189
- Nina, how are you feeling?
- Better, mostly. You?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.894
I'm... I'm doing fine.

33:46.794 --> 33:48.796
- I'm just fine.
- Below Quincy Street,

33:48.828 --> 33:51.132
there's a sealed off
underground pumping station.

33:51.164 --> 33:53.033
It was built in 1894,

33:53.067 --> 33:56.053
then decommissioned after the
Great Depression, when the federal

33:56.054 --> 33:59.794
government financed
a WPA-related sewer rebuild.

34:01.342 --> 34:02.977
So let's set a trap.

34:48.039 --> 34:50.742
Okay, you take this door here.

34:50.775 --> 34:52.610
And I'll take the door
at the end of the tunnel.

34:52.641 --> 34:55.579
All right. Everybody should be
in position at the other doors,

34:55.612 --> 34:57.014
if all has gone according to planned.

34:57.047 --> 34:58.582
Give two minutes till target time.

34:58.615 --> 35:00.784
- Okay. See you inside.
- Careful.

35:00.818 --> 35:02.053
Careful's my middle name.

35:02.086 --> 35:05.290
I know your middle name.
I wish it was "Careful."

36:05.714 --> 36:08.952
<i>I'm impressed, Jane.</i>

36:08.985 --> 36:11.521
<i>I didn't really think you'd go
where I tell you to,</i>

36:11.555 --> 36:13.424
<i>but I didn't think
you'd find me, either.</i>

36:13.456 --> 36:15.559
Yeah, well, I can't take all the credit.

36:15.593 --> 36:20.365
<i>So modest.
That's how I remember you.</i>

36:20.398 --> 36:22.400
Yeah, I doubt that's how
you remember me.

36:22.432 --> 36:26.503
<i>I'm just trying to be polite, Jane.</i>

36:26.537 --> 36:29.707
The academy was
a long time ago, Alice.

36:29.740 --> 36:31.843
You seem too smart to be still upset

36:31.876 --> 36:34.845
about somebody who beat you
in a rope climb.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.858
You don't remember anything about me.

36:46.890 --> 36:49.376
You just crammed a lifetime

36:49.377 --> 36:54.465
of crazy and disappointment
onto our shared history.

36:54.497 --> 36:57.534
If you'd been able to handle
just a little bit of competition,

36:57.568 --> 37:01.988
you'd probably be
the chief of police right now.

37:03.541 --> 37:07.644
Looking for your backup?
There's only one way in.

37:07.677 --> 37:11.849
We sealed the other doors.
You're alone.

37:15.686 --> 37:19.724
Put the gun down, Alice.
Enough people have been hurt.

37:33.838 --> 37:35.039
Shoot the others.

37:38.709 --> 37:40.845
Get on the ground!
All of you, get on the ground now!

37:40.878 --> 37:42.413
Get your hands behind your head!

37:42.414 --> 37:45.950
Hands behind your head now!
Don't move.

37:49.986 --> 37:52.923
We searched for three hours.

37:52.956 --> 37:55.592
Above ground, below ground.
Nothing.

37:56.961 --> 37:58.663
Well, now you've flushed her out.

37:58.695 --> 38:01.531
<i>And tomorrow, you'll figure out
where she's gone.</i>

38:01.564 --> 38:06.536
Yeah. I would love
to continue today, but I just...

38:06.570 --> 38:08.606
The mind works better with rest.

38:08.639 --> 38:10.707
<i>Yes.</i>

38:10.740 --> 38:12.843
I like your new place.
It's homey.

38:12.876 --> 38:14.177
Thank you.

38:15.979 --> 38:17.014
Here you go.

38:17.048 --> 38:19.717
I can't. I have to wait
at least a few more days.

38:19.749 --> 38:23.688
It's not bad enough
that you have a concussion.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.724
But Alice took away alcohol as well?

38:27.758 --> 38:31.262
So where were you this afternoon?

38:31.294 --> 38:34.130
At the hospital.

38:34.164 --> 38:36.033
And what'd you find out?

38:36.066 --> 38:39.704
What makes you think
I had to find out anything?

38:39.736 --> 38:41.606
Because when you have
something important to say,

38:41.639 --> 38:44.575
you always exhale a lot louder
than when you don't.

38:44.608 --> 38:47.945
I always thought it was
a relaxation technique.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.881
Do I really do that?

38:50.914 --> 38:53.050
Oh. I do do that.

38:53.082 --> 38:54.952
You also have a tendency
to change the subject

38:54.985 --> 38:56.988
and ask a lot of questions
when it's really bad news.

38:57.021 --> 39:02.126
- Oh, everybody does that, don't they?
- Like that.

39:03.961 --> 39:06.997
I had some internal bleeding to
my temporal lobe from the fall,

39:07.030 --> 39:10.867
and it's caused
some cognitive impairment.

39:14.046 --> 39:18.843
- So what are they gonna do?
- There's no reason to do anything.

39:18.876 --> 39:21.044
You know, and the bleeding
has stopped. I'm fine.

39:21.077 --> 39:23.014
The brain... it's funny.

39:23.046 --> 39:25.949
In two days, it might be like
nothing ever happened.

39:25.983 --> 39:31.621
- But right now?
- I'm forgetting things.

39:31.655 --> 39:33.823
Small things. Words.

39:33.856 --> 39:37.661
Like "mass spectrometer."

39:37.695 --> 39:40.764
Though obviously I remembered
it now because I did a memory

39:40.765 --> 39:43.834
palace technique earlier today
where I put the mass spectrometer

39:43.867 --> 39:45.303
- in a different room.
- Maura.

39:45.336 --> 39:49.006
That really helped... helped me.

39:49.039 --> 39:51.842
I'm not gonna worry about
the things I can't control.

39:51.874 --> 39:54.644
I'm gonna do what my doctors
tell me to do,

39:54.677 --> 39:57.814
and I'm going
to let my friends help me

39:57.847 --> 40:00.684
if I have a few small problems.

40:00.718 --> 40:04.789
Of course.
We'll get through it.

40:04.822 --> 40:07.652
I know.

40:14.131 --> 40:16.801
<i>O, Blessed Virgin Mary,
Mother of my God,</i>

40:16.834 --> 40:18.803
<i>intercede for me
that I may obtain the grace</i>

40:18.836 --> 40:21.939
<i>to make a good confession.</i>

40:21.972 --> 40:25.142
<i>All you blessed Archangels,
Angels and Saints of God,</i>

40:25.175 --> 40:28.713
<i>pray for me.
Amen.</i>

40:30.314 --> 40:32.316
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</i>

40:32.349 --> 40:35.352
<i>Amen.</i>

40:35.385 --> 40:37.887
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

40:37.921 --> 40:41.092
It's been...

40:41.124 --> 40:45.762
a really long time
since my last confession.

40:45.796 --> 40:49.000
I'm not really sure what I should say.

40:49.032 --> 40:54.371
There are a-a lot of reasons

40:54.405 --> 40:59.110
that I should come here, I'm sure.

40:59.142 --> 41:01.111
None of them are why
I'm here today.

41:01.144 --> 41:04.814
<i>What have you come to confess, Jane?</i>

41:04.847 --> 41:08.753
<i>What have you done?</i>

41:08.785 --> 41:11.755
Someone's after me.

41:11.789 --> 41:17.261
They're hurting my friends, my family.

41:17.293 --> 41:20.797
It's not what I've done.

41:21.131 --> 41:24.972
It's what I'm gonna do.
