Watch your step.

-[man] La casa del amor.
-[woman] Ah!

07:29.866 --> 07:32.201
I forgot how gorgeous this place is.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.163
I mean, look how good this looks.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.331
[man] Where the fuck are all the flowers?

07:37.415 --> 07:38.249
[woman] What?

07:38.332 --> 07:41.669
[man] I told April to buy
an inordinate amount of flowers,

07:41.752 --> 07:44.297
-and I don't see one flower.
-It's okay. It's fine.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.715
It looks beautiful.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.927
No, that-that--
That's not really what I had in mind..

07:53.014 --> 07:54.807
What are you doing? [woman laughs]

07:54.891 --> 07:56.601
-I can yell at April later.
-No!

07:56.684 --> 07:59.896
-Baby, get these clothes off.
-No. [laughs]

07:59.979 --> 08:02.440
No. Unpack first, okay? Please?

08:02.940 --> 08:04.150
-Unpack first.
-Why?

08:04.233 --> 08:08.821
Because I'm classy, and I would rather
the bedroom than the living room, and--

08:08.905 --> 08:10.156
No! [woman laughs]

08:10.239 --> 08:13.075
[man] You wanna see
if they bothered to stock the fridge?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.578
-[woman] Yes, I'm checking.
-[clattering]

08:15.661 --> 08:17.914
I will unpack the bags.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.962
[man] What's the fucking point
of having an assistant…

08:29.008 --> 08:32.178
[loudly] Uh, there's milk that's expired.

08:32.803 --> 08:33.888
Great.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.224
And orange juice that's open.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.560
[laughs] Didn't you tell April
we were coming?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.855
Babe, I-I-I thought we discussed

08:42.939 --> 08:45.691
not yelling at each other
from across the house.

08:47.944 --> 08:48.986
Right. Yeah.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.739
[suspenseful music continues]

08:55.409 --> 08:58.162
It's fine. It just means
we have to go ourselves and--

08:59.288 --> 09:00.540
[man] Is there no food?

09:01.457 --> 09:03.459
[man] Babe? Hello?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.253
Babe?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.381
Are you not--

09:09.131 --> 09:10.675
Are you not answering
because I'm yelling

09:10.758 --> 09:12.843
or because you can't hear me-- Holy fuck!

09:13.803 --> 09:15.805
I need you to sit down on that couch.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.807
I'm not fucking around.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.268
Okay, but how about
you let go of my wife first?

09:20.351 --> 09:22.645
I'll let her go
when you sit on the couch!

09:22.728 --> 09:25.481
This isn't a negotiation. Sit down. Sit.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
-Okay.
-Okay, I don't want to hurt her.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.027
[man] Sit down.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.322
-[husband] I'm sitting down.
-Good. Now you sit down.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.324
Not there. Sit over there.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.662
You're not gonna fuck with me either.
Do we understand each other?

09:40.371 --> 09:41.956
-Yes or no?
-You can talk to me.

09:42.039 --> 09:45.042
Can I help you with something?
Money? Is that what you want?

09:45.543 --> 09:48.629
Let me make that happen.
You don't wanna hurt anyone, right?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.590
You're not the kinda guy
that would hurt someone.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.175
You already know what kind of guy I am?

09:53.759 --> 09:54.969
Is that right?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.472
That's not what I'm saying.
What do you want? Let me help you.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.977
What are you doing? Hey!

10:03.060 --> 10:05.062
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.941
-You don't need to--
-I'm trying to cooperate.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.027
-We have money.
-I'm trying to cooperate.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.737
-No one knows we're--
-Shh.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.740
I'm gonna tie your feet together
and you're not gonna move.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.284
You don't have to tie our feet.
We're not gonna move.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.871
-Were you on staff? Is that what this is?
-Not everybody works for you.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.373
[wife] Does it have to be so tight?

10:25.875 --> 10:26.876
Please.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.128
You're already cutting off my circulation.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.465
Hey! Hey!
Get your hand out of your pocket.

10:32.548 --> 10:36.344
Give me your phone. Both of you.
Put your phone on the table. Take it out!

10:36.427 --> 10:39.680
Put it on the table.
You too. Phone, out.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.266
Put it on the table.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.351
Okay.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.897
-Is this your only phone?
-Yes.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.523
That's my only phone.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.233
Yeah?

10:52.151 --> 10:53.861
You sure? Maybe I should check.

10:53.944 --> 10:54.904
Okay, okay.

10:56.947 --> 10:57.782
There you go.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.827
Great job. Now I gotta check her purse.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.704
See what you did?

11:04.830 --> 11:08.584
-[wife] You don't have to do that.
-Yeah? I didn't. Now I do.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.128
[breathing heavily]

11:11.212 --> 11:12.963
How the fuck do you open this?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.007
How does this open?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.926
-Is there a trick to the purse?
-No!

11:17.009 --> 11:18.427
There's a fucking clasp.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.346
I got it.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.598
[husband] Okay. You obviously--

11:22.682 --> 11:24.892
You-- You want money, yes?

11:24.975 --> 11:27.186
I want to give you money, okay?

11:27.269 --> 11:30.189
I-I know I've got some cash
squirreled away here somewhere.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.316
[wife] We have some for emergencies.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.151
Yes. For emergencies.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.029
Now, we're never here,
so it's going to take me a second

11:37.113 --> 11:39.448
to remember where the fuck
this money might be,

11:39.532 --> 11:41.784
but I'm going to get it to you
and get you on your way.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.285
I-I found your watch.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.370
Your Rolex.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.496
Yeah. I-I see that.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.790
And in there, I found some money
in a hollowed-out book.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.792
-There's probably more--
-We have more.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.378
Yes. If there's anything else,
it's going to be in the office,

11:52.461 --> 11:55.881
so can I get up
and take you into the office?

11:55.965 --> 11:56.966
Slow.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.927
[husband] You okay, baby?

12:00.010 --> 12:01.429
-[man] She's fine.
-Yeah.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.598
[man] Okay. You can let go. Go.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.268
If you move, I'm gonna hear you.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.145
[husband] She's not going to move.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.105
It'll be all right, baby.
Just gimme one minute.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.986
I know we had a secret compartment
put in here somewhere.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.196
Hey! Do not try anything.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.239
I'm not.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.783
I'm trying to get you your money.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.082
You seem to know who I am, right?

12:30.958 --> 12:33.502
Is there something
you would like for me to call you, sir?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.921
Sooner we're out of here,
the better. Okay?

12:38.215 --> 12:40.384
Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.430
I'm gonna ask you a question.
You're going to tell me the truth.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.933
Is there a gun in this house?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.186
No.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.773
Is that it? Anything else?

12:54.482 --> 12:55.316
No.

13:03.699 --> 13:04.700
[husband] See?

13:05.743 --> 13:06.744
Gimme that.

13:09.830 --> 13:10.915
Go.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.750
Go.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.424
It's around 5,000.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.303
So, between my Rolex,

13:24.386 --> 13:27.348
the money you found in the office,
and that, I'd say you had

13:27.431 --> 13:30.267
a pretty successful morning
over at my house, huh?

13:31.519 --> 13:34.897
Anything else is gonna be
too big to carry or too easy to trace.

13:34.980 --> 13:35.898
So that's it.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.317
And you have our phones.
There's no landline.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.194
No landlines, no security cameras.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.988
And we don't have neighbors for miles.
We don't even know them.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.949
So, for us, it's like you were never here.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.910
Exactly. We walked in.
Some shit was already missing.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.455
But not even enough
to… to file a police report.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.461
[man] Put your hands behind your back.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.421
No.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.341
Lean forward
and put your hands behind your back!

14:02.424 --> 14:04.885
-Don't do that. Just go!
-Have you not heard a thing I've said?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.805
Yeah. I heard everything you said.
I'm not gonna leave you here

14:07.888 --> 14:10.015
to do whatever you want
the second I walk out the door.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.226
You walk out,
we forget you exist, end of story.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.145
-I'm gonna myself a head start.
-No one knows we're here.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.231
I don't fucking believe you.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.196
Goddamn it!

14:26.115 --> 14:28.951
[moody music playing]

14:29.034 --> 14:30.786
Okay, so what now? [wife sighs]

14:30.870 --> 14:31.871
Just walk.

14:33.247 --> 14:37.209
-Any direction?
-Yeah. To… To the right. This one.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.596
[husband] So, what is the plan here?

14:48.679 --> 14:51.056
[man] The plan is for you
to shut the fuck up.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.851
Go. Straight.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.815
[husband] That's not really a plan.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.030
No, right here.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.658
Open the door. Get inside.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.743
What?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.537
Y-You're really gonna lock us
in the sauna?

15:13.621 --> 15:14.705
This is your plan?

15:14.788 --> 15:18.584
To lock us in the fucking sauna
for days on end with no food or water?

15:18.667 --> 15:19.960
[man] It's not gonna be days.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.088
I'm gonna barricade the door
so it'll take a while, but you'll get out.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.549
This is the only thing
that's gonna work for us.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.970
No, I'm not in the mood for a schvitz.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.014
[man] It's not gonna be on. Get in.

15:32.097 --> 15:32.932
No.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.183
You're going to have to

15:34.975 --> 15:36.727
rack your brain for something else.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.695
I don't wanna hurt you
in front of your wife.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.702
Okay. Babe?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.503
[wife grunts] Ow.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.641
You're not gonna know when I'm gone.

16:15.724 --> 16:19.144
I suggest you wait like an hour
before you start trying to get out.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.437
Mm-hmm, mm-mm.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.816
[brooding music playing]

16:23.899 --> 16:25.067
You know, uh, buddy,

16:25.150 --> 16:28.529
y-you're not getting
what I've been trying to tell you.

16:28.612 --> 16:29.905
No one knows we're here!

16:29.989 --> 16:33.033
I was scheduled t-to give
the keynote at CES this weekend,

16:33.117 --> 16:35.369
but I pulled out at the last minute, okay?

16:35.869 --> 16:38.539
I pulled out to surprise her!

16:38.622 --> 16:43.043
I moved fucking mountains
to change my schedule for her!

16:43.127 --> 16:45.337
-And then you fucking showed up.
-For us.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.797
-What?
-For us.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.675
For us! Yes, that's what I said. For us!

16:49.758 --> 16:54.221
Which I did gladly so we could have
a little fucking alone time! Okay?

16:54.304 --> 16:55.931
Enjoy the alone time, then.

17:01.353 --> 17:05.024
I'm gonna fucking kill him.
I'm-- I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna fucking--

17:06.692 --> 17:07.526
Fuck!

17:13.615 --> 17:14.616
[husband] Hey!

17:19.663 --> 17:21.582
[husband] Hey! Fuck!

17:25.210 --> 17:27.087
I really don't think he had a gun.

[tense music intensifies]

20:49.831 --> 20:51.625
[husband] Hurry! Come on, come on.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.252
[man] Hey!

20:53.335 --> 20:54.586
[music stops]

20:54.670 --> 20:55.837
Hey, stop!

[tense music resumes]

21:15.482 --> 21:17.442
Stop! Stop!

21:31.415 --> 21:32.374
Fuck.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.186
[panting]

22:05.073 --> 22:08.410
I'm gonna fucking get you! Stop! Stop!

22:08.493 --> 22:10.120
Stop, sto--

22:10.203 --> 22:13.332
-Stop, what the fuck!
-I win! I got you. Just stop.

22:13.415 --> 22:17.169
Don't make us run anymore.
Any way you go, I'm gonna get you.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.962
Just stop. Stop.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.298
-[both panting with effort]
-Or-- No.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.925
Stop. Stay down. Stay down.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.469
I'm not fucking around.

22:25.552 --> 22:26.553
Get her back here.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.515
-I've got him! Get back here now.
-[husband yells] Babe!

22:34.227 --> 22:35.395
[husband] Babe!

22:35.479 --> 22:36.980
I've got your gun.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.282
Whose camera is that?

22:47.783 --> 22:49.368
How am I supposed to know that?

22:50.160 --> 22:53.455
A-And are you sure
that what you saw was even a camera?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.540
Am I sure that-- Yes, it was a camera.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.501
Where does it go?

22:57.584 --> 22:59.544
[husband] I have no idea.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.632
Also, you know as well as I do,
once something is recorded digitally--

23:03.715 --> 23:05.759
If it even was--

23:05.842 --> 23:07.052
It's just out there.

23:07.135 --> 23:10.222
There's nothing you can do about it.
It's not like a 7-Eleven

23:10.722 --> 23:13.934
where you can go in the back
and-and tear out a hard drive.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.520
Everyone's an idiot to you, huh?

23:16.603 --> 23:17.687
No, not everyone.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.817
-You lied to me.
-[husband] I'm not lying.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.028
We have no security cameras
on our property.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.780
Really? Just like there's no gun?

23:26.863 --> 23:31.284
Speaking of which, how about we establish
some-- some ground rules on that gun?

23:31.368 --> 23:33.036
-Meaning what?
-Meaning I have no idea

23:33.120 --> 23:34.871
how much you've used or been around guns,

23:34.955 --> 23:39.251
but if you're going to be pointing it
at one of us, you can point at me. Okay?

23:39.334 --> 23:41.169
I haven't pointed it at anybody yet.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.297
I know that. All I'm saying is,
we know you have a gun.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.174
We're not going anywhere.

23:47.634 --> 23:52.514
And to prevent any fucking…
[makes gunshot noises] …oopsie-doopsies,

23:53.348 --> 23:54.433
just put the safety on.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.852
Safety's on.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.688
So, nothing accidental.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.566
[husband] Great. But the question remains,

24:03.275 --> 24:05.485
what do you want me to do?

24:07.612 --> 24:09.239
It's the same situation, guys.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.740
It's not the same situation.

24:10.824 --> 24:16.163
Not if my face is out there.
Not if I have to… hide from this.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.956
You think five grand is gonna cut it?

24:18.039 --> 24:20.542
All that's changed is
the amount you need, right?

24:22.085 --> 24:23.086
Am I right?

24:24.880 --> 24:28.300
We still all-- All three of us,
we have to find a way through this.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.470
So it comes down to how much and how soon.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.807
So… how much?

24:37.309 --> 24:41.563
To what? To disappear? Start a new life?
Looks like that's what it's going to take.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.024
So… you know…

24:45.775 --> 24:49.196
A hundred-- A hundred--
Hundred fifty thousand dollars.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.238
[husband chuckles]

24:50.322 --> 24:52.032
What? What is so fucking funny?

24:52.115 --> 24:54.534
-Hundred fifty thousand?
-Hundred fifty thousand.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.496
You think that's enough?

24:57.579 --> 24:59.789
Yeah, I-I think you're going to want more.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.793
If you were looking for
any reasonable quality of life,

25:03.877 --> 25:04.836
yes, that's right.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.214
Something tells me
that maybe you and I have

25:07.297 --> 25:09.758
some very different pictures
of quality of life.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.676
Oh, most definitely we do,

25:11.760 --> 25:15.222
but either way,
I don't think 150,000 is going to cut it.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.474
You're going to blow through it
like that. [snaps]

25:19.434 --> 25:21.978
Double it, then. Three hundred thousand.

25:23.146 --> 25:27.859
Babe. Where was this cutthroat negotiator
when we were doing our prenups?

25:29.152 --> 25:30.153
[wife chuckles]

25:32.697 --> 25:34.699
Uh, anyway,

25:35.909 --> 25:37.619
one man's opinion,

25:38.703 --> 25:40.247
I think we're still too low.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.168
Great. Then let's, uh… let's add a zero.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.337
Three million.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.758
-[laughing]
-What are you laughing at?

25:53.760 --> 25:56.388
Well, n-now you're just--
You're sounding ridiculous.

25:56.972 --> 26:01.268
Excuse me. Aren't you worth
several billion dollars now or something?

26:01.351 --> 26:05.522
Whatever I'm rumored to be worth,
which is actually much more,

26:06.106 --> 26:09.442
that still doesn't mean
that I can just pick up a little red phone

26:09.526 --> 26:12.028
and withdraw however much money
whenever I want.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.530
That's not the way it works.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.865
Also, if I'm asking
for three million dollars,

26:15.949 --> 26:18.952
well, don't you think
that might set off a few alarm bells?

26:19.035 --> 26:21.496
Which isn't exactly
what you want, correct?

26:21.580 --> 26:24.374
Fine! Then what is--
What's the most that you can get?

26:24.457 --> 26:26.668
What's the-- What is the max?

26:26.751 --> 26:28.003
You don't want the max.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.047
I want the f--
I want the max! What's the max?

26:31.131 --> 26:35.343
I'm the only one here
that has actually been inside a room

26:35.427 --> 26:37.345
with over a million dollars in it.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.640
Now, there are certain limitations
to that kind of money.

26:40.724 --> 26:44.769
Not only the amount,
but how much does that money weigh?

26:44.853 --> 26:46.896
How much can I physically carry?

26:46.980 --> 26:50.358
Do you have any idea
how much three million dollars weighs?

26:50.442 --> 26:51.443
How much?

26:53.028 --> 26:57.032
Well, I don't know the actual weight.
That's not the point.

26:57.115 --> 27:00.285
Point is that you have to think about
how much can fit inside one suit--

27:00.368 --> 27:01.494
Just tell me the amount.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.372
Okay? Just tell-- Wh-What's the--

27:06.124 --> 27:07.375
What's the number?

27:07.459 --> 27:08.460
[husband chuckles]

27:13.757 --> 27:15.467
Guys, I have to use the bathroom.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.302
What?

27:18.595 --> 27:20.013
I waited as long as I could.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.601
So, how we gonna do this?

27:27.270 --> 27:28.813
[man] Hey, hold on.

27:29.939 --> 27:30.815
Hold on.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.163
This curtain stays open.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.749
Wait, what? I… I can't go like that.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.794
-What's the problem?
-Privacy?

27:52.462 --> 27:55.590
Okay. Uh… there's an option B,

27:55.674 --> 27:58.218
which is you pick a corner
of the living room and do your business.

27:58.301 --> 27:59.302
I'm fine either way.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.847
-Tempting.
-[husband groans]

28:15.443 --> 28:16.653
[exhales]

28:16.736 --> 28:17.570
Okay.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.539
[grunts]

28:33.211 --> 28:34.045
[husband] Hmm.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.548
Got it.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.049
Yeah.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.136
[husband] So why me?

28:42.554 --> 28:47.142
I mean, other than the obvious reason,
why did you target my house?

28:47.642 --> 28:50.854
I think the less we know
about each other, the better, don't you?

28:52.689 --> 28:54.858
This does not seem random to me.

28:54.941 --> 28:58.194
It seems like you knew
there would be no security cameras…

28:58.278 --> 29:01.489
-[toilet flushes]
-…and it seems you expected us to be gone.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.326
Due diligence on your part.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.412
Much better.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.497
[foreboding music playing]

29:26.639 --> 29:28.558
[husband] Four hundred fifty thousand.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.230
[man Let's round it up.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.566
Even 500.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.860
Just feels right to me.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.988
Okay, we could do that. But the problem--

29:42.071 --> 29:43.072
I-I remember.

29:44.157 --> 29:48.244
If I'm having any trouble
carrying the extra 50, I'll, uh…

29:48.328 --> 29:50.163
I'll leave it in your pool.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.380
Half a mil it is.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.887
Let's go get you your money.

30:05.970 --> 30:09.098
[foreboding music rising]

30:14.354 --> 30:15.355
It's working.

30:21.569 --> 30:22.445
Hey.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.073
Stay where I can see you.

30:31.871 --> 30:34.916
-No, hey. [snaps] Audio. Audio only.
-[husband mutters]

30:35.917 --> 30:38.503
Every time I call on the computer,

30:38.586 --> 30:39.838
-it's on video.
-Yeah?

30:39.921 --> 30:42.048
Well, I don't care. Not this time.

30:43.466 --> 30:47.387
Have you ever called someone
for a quick emergency delivery of 500k?

30:48.555 --> 30:50.056
Yes. Just last week I did.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.519
Okay, look, I can get you the money.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.522
It will, however,
require a little fucking finesse.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.359
If I call and ask my assistant
to arrange this kind of cash,

31:01.442 --> 31:02.944
and don't do it face-to-face,

31:03.027 --> 31:05.029
that might seem a little suspicious.

31:08.449 --> 31:10.410
I'm gonna be standing right here.

31:10.493 --> 31:11.703
-Perfect.
-Right here.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.582
And if you so much as blink
in a way that I find questionable,

31:15.665 --> 31:17.667
we're gonna have a problem, okay?

31:17.750 --> 31:20.920
So, no-- no nose-scratching.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.089
No, uh, no code words.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.592
Okay, Matt Helm. Copy that.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.218
Who the fuck is Matt Helm?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.971
[exhales] Dean Martin?

31:32.098 --> 31:33.433
"Talk about a booby trap."

31:34.225 --> 31:35.059
You never seen that?

31:35.935 --> 31:38.438
Uh, just-- just focus on
what we're-- On this.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.857
-All right.
-[keyboard clicks]

31:40.940 --> 31:41.941
[computer beeps]

31:43.026 --> 31:45.862
[groans]

31:49.240 --> 31:51.868
-April.
-Hey! Wasn't expecting to hear from you.

31:51.951 --> 31:58.041
-How'd it go with the flowers?
-Don't even get me started on the flowers.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.126
-Um, all right.
-Um…

32:02.295 --> 32:03.922
I have a situation

32:04.005 --> 32:08.092
that needs to be dealt with
quickly and discreetly. Okay?

32:08.176 --> 32:09.302
Okay.

32:09.385 --> 32:13.723
I need $500,000
delivered to me in cash here.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.808
Five hundred thousand in cash?

32:16.392 --> 32:17.226
Okay.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.982
-Debbie is back.
-[April whispers] Wait, what?

32:23.483 --> 32:25.360
-Even with the NDA?
-Okay, shut up.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.154
My wife is here, so that's all I can say.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.282
But how quickly can you get this to me?

32:31.366 --> 32:33.368
Well, it's gonna be tomorrow.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.620
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.163
You can't get it to me today?

32:37.246 --> 32:38.414
I don't see how.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.792
How do you know
off the top of your head that you can't?

32:40.875 --> 32:44.045
It's already 3:30. By the time I get
the paperwork together and process,

32:44.128 --> 32:46.339
-the bank won't even--
-Okay! Fuck. Tomorrow.

32:47.423 --> 32:50.051
-Tomorrow when?
-By tomorrow evening.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.012
Tomorrow afternoon, okay?

32:53.096 --> 32:55.932
-Let's say tomorrow afternoon.
-Okay. I'll get it done.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.893
I want 400,000 in hundreds,
the rest in 20s.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.854
Single bag. We can use
the same PI as last time.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.357
Have him drop it off
outside the gate, okay?

33:04.440 --> 33:06.776
Send me a confirmation email
by noon tomorrow.

33:07.568 --> 33:10.571
Okay? You're going to give me
some nod of acknowledgment

33:10.655 --> 33:11.906
that you heard one thing I said?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.659
-Yes. Okay. I'm on it.
-Make it happen, April. Fuck!

33:15.827 --> 33:16.828
Debbie, huh?

33:19.664 --> 33:20.957
You're a real class act.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.129
You don't fucking know me.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.548
Go fuck yourself.

33:28.631 --> 33:30.633
[moody music playing]

33:43.187 --> 33:44.230
No knives.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.578
[wife clears throat]

34:01.039 --> 34:03.750
[wife sighs] What,
are we supposed to make small talk?

34:08.087 --> 34:10.548
Well, I-I mean,
you guys could talk to each other.

34:12.258 --> 34:15.386
-Or is that not something you're used to?
-Not at gunpoint, no.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.973
It's not like we can ask you your name

34:20.224 --> 34:24.103
or where you're from
or what you do, or did, for a living,

34:24.187 --> 34:27.356
and, well, it's sunny out,
so the weather's covered.

34:28.107 --> 34:31.194
Hobbies and favorite color
probably are safe.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.571
Him, I've read plenty about.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.908
But you're a mystery,
so why don't you start?

34:36.991 --> 34:39.285
My favorite color's black.

34:39.368 --> 34:40.203
I can tell.

34:41.662 --> 34:44.457
What's this tattoo
you're getting removed on your foot?

34:44.999 --> 34:47.627
[husband] How about
you stop looking at my wife's feet, yeah?

34:48.127 --> 34:49.128
It was nothing.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.048
[man] The tattoo was nothing?

34:52.632 --> 34:55.718
That was one of the ugliest tattoos
I've ever seen in my life.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.888
Yeah, I know.
You've made that pretty clear.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.474
[coughs, laughs]

35:01.557 --> 35:02.600
Yikes.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.730
Let's keep, uh, spinning this wheel.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.065
How'd you two meet?

35:11.484 --> 35:12.485
Honey?

35:15.571 --> 35:18.032
Um, we met at a fundraiser.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.368
-Cystic fibrosis.
-Muscular dystrophy.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.371
Back when I was an assistant.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.455
Ah.

35:25.081 --> 35:25.915
Got it.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.084
You were his assistant.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.796
No. Not his assistant, an assistant.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.381
The route most people take.

35:33.881 --> 35:36.801
Unless, of course, you've made a fortune

35:36.884 --> 35:38.886
or rob people in their homes.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.180
Or work for your husband.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.473
[wife] I work with him.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.851
Okay, I head up our foundation,

35:44.934 --> 35:48.104
a job I'm highly qualified for,
having worked for non-profits

35:48.187 --> 35:49.480
since before college.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.482
It's probably very similar,

35:51.566 --> 35:54.152
except now you just have
all this money to play around with.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.404
I'm not playing around with anything.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.197
It's… It's not a game, okay?

35:58.281 --> 36:00.283
And not that I have to justify
my resume to you,

36:00.366 --> 36:03.286
but now I'm in charge of building
schools and hospitals

36:03.369 --> 36:04.912
-on four continents…
-You are justifying.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.582
…so you can try
and belittle what I do all you want,

36:07.665 --> 36:09.000
but results speak for themselves.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.335
And you can go ahead
and question my motives,

36:11.419 --> 36:14.672
but at least I know what I'll be doing
for the next 4 or 5 years.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.092
That's not exactly true.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.803
You'll be taking on
more of an advisory role

36:20.887 --> 36:21.888
once we have a baby.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.266
Right, babe?

36:25.349 --> 36:27.435
[clicks tongue] Right. That's the plan.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.026
[gloomy music plays]

36:50.291 --> 36:52.668
Did I or one of my companies do something

36:52.752 --> 36:55.838
to harm or offend you personally
in some way?

36:59.884 --> 37:01.552
It really feels like you hate me.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.054
[man] Huh.

37:05.681 --> 37:10.686
I don't fucking get it.
How can people be so mad at me?

37:12.104 --> 37:15.399
It's like fucking being mad at
a fucking clock.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.736
If you're mad at a clock,
that's really on you.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.071
It's not about the clock.

37:21.239 --> 37:26.702
I'm supposed to apologize for writing
an algorithm that was inevitable

37:27.578 --> 37:32.959
and that saves companies and enriches
the lives of hundreds of employees?

37:33.042 --> 37:34.252
[man laughs derisively]

37:35.294 --> 37:37.463
-Did I say something funny?
-Yeah.

37:37.546 --> 37:41.550
Hearing you talk about
enriching people's lives is funny to me.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.427
[husband] Do I not do that?

37:44.845 --> 37:47.723
You know,
it's really pretty fucking rudimentary.

37:47.807 --> 37:51.978
A bloated, fat company dies,
all jobs lost.

37:52.061 --> 37:56.148
Or a leaner, more efficient version
of that same company survives,

37:56.232 --> 37:57.400
some jobs survive.

37:58.317 --> 38:03.906
If anything, I'm helping people find
a new career path that's more sustainable.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.909
But you, however…

38:07.910 --> 38:11.539
You are here for the sole purpose
of enriching yourself.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.292
[man] You have no idea what I'm here for,

38:14.375 --> 38:16.377
or even if that money is just for me.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.755
It's meaningless to you, anyway.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.258
Money that could change
any other person's life.

38:23.759 --> 38:27.722
I just doubt
you're going to give it all to the poor.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.978
[gloomy music continues]

39:01.255 --> 39:02.381
Hey, what is this?

39:02.465 --> 39:05.217
-What does it look like?
-It's a Zen garden.

39:06.302 --> 39:09.597
Just like the little ones you see
on people's desks, but big.

39:17.855 --> 39:18.939
Last time I was here,

39:20.024 --> 39:24.445
I had the idea of putting in
a Mr. Miyagi-style fence, so it's in.

39:24.945 --> 39:25.946
Remember?

39:27.198 --> 39:29.283
Yeah. I still don't know what that means.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.078
A Mr. Miyagi-style fence.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.885
All right, guys. What's, uh,
what's up next on the agenda?

39:51.138 --> 39:53.641
What other shit
you have around here you don't use?

39:54.683 --> 39:56.685
[horses neighing]

40:13.994 --> 40:16.914
-[wife laughing]

40:24.505 --> 40:25.506
[wife laughs]

40:29.927 --> 40:32.638
[actor gurgling on-screen]

40:33.139 --> 40:33.973
[actor spits]

40:34.515 --> 40:36.517
[brooding instrumental music playing]

41:11.927 --> 41:12.928
Good work.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.354
You need to get close to him, babe.

41:22.438 --> 41:23.439
Win him over.

41:26.525 --> 41:27.860
What? What are you--

41:27.943 --> 41:29.862
We don't know this guy.

41:29.945 --> 41:33.616
We don't know what he intends to do
once he gets the money.

41:34.617 --> 41:38.496
So, you need to get close to him.
Do whatever it takes. Okay?

41:39.455 --> 41:41.916
-I don't--
-Do whatever it takes. That's it.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.584
You can do it.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.171
[man] All right.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.881
Either of you have a preference?

41:49.882 --> 41:53.302
I still don't understand why you think
it's necessary to split us up.

41:53.886 --> 41:57.473
Yeah. Well, like I said,
for my peace of mind.

41:57.973 --> 42:00.643
So…  why don't you go ahead and choose?

42:01.685 --> 42:02.686
Babe?

42:03.354 --> 42:05.606
-Do you have a preference?
-I-I don't care.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.111
Why don't you take this one over here?

42:11.946 --> 42:14.573
Not like either one of us
are going to sleep anyways.

42:17.034 --> 42:20.037
Just remember, I'll be right over here
the whole night, okay?

42:21.497 --> 42:22.498
Okay?

42:22.998 --> 42:23.999
[wife sniffs]

42:24.500 --> 42:25.501
Okay?

42:26.001 --> 42:27.002
Yeah.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.673
[man] Doors stay open.

42:38.514 --> 42:41.475
-[husband] Shut the light off?
-[man] If it helps you.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.601
[brooding music continues]

43:43.162 --> 43:46.624
[fire crackling]

44:44.390 --> 44:46.225
Can't sleep. [wife sighs]

44:48.811 --> 44:49.812
Okay.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.314
It's gonna be a long night.

44:57.152 --> 44:58.153
Yeah.

44:59.154 --> 45:01.949
Followed by a very long day.

45:07.329 --> 45:08.330
[wife chuckles]

45:09.665 --> 45:13.502
And the only man I know who could
fall asleep during his own kidnapping.

45:13.585 --> 45:14.586
[chuckles]

45:16.588 --> 45:20.175
I guess it's one of those "if you don't
laugh, you cry" moments, huh?

45:20.259 --> 45:21.301
[clears throat]

45:22.553 --> 45:23.554
Do you mind?

45:26.890 --> 45:28.392
No. I don't mind.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.856
[wife exhales]

45:36.775 --> 45:37.776
[wife exhales]

45:42.448 --> 45:45.659
Your life is gonna be
very different after tomorrow.

45:47.578 --> 45:51.498
My life became very different the second
you two walked through the front door.

45:53.959 --> 45:55.961
I was almost gone, too.

45:57.755 --> 45:58.839
I was leaving.

46:02.217 --> 46:03.552
Couldn't help myself.

46:08.515 --> 46:09.641
What are you gonna do?

46:16.106 --> 46:20.736
The end of the day,
everything being totally different,

46:20.819 --> 46:22.029
that's okay with me.

46:25.199 --> 46:27.826
-I get that.
-Oh. You do?

46:30.162 --> 46:33.373
I think everyone feels that
at least once or twice in their life.

46:36.668 --> 46:37.711
Do you?

46:39.254 --> 46:42.382
There was a time I didn't know
what I wanted to do with myself,

46:42.466 --> 46:43.759
like anybody else.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.388
Then you found your purpose with him, huh?

46:49.848 --> 46:51.850
He and I found it together.

46:53.101 --> 46:54.353
Picture perfect.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.480
Picture perfect.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.232
That's great.

46:58.857 --> 47:01.568
You guys are trying to have a kid?
That's what he said?

47:02.277 --> 47:03.278
We are.

47:03.862 --> 47:04.905
Congratulations.

47:06.532 --> 47:09.493
That takes any relationship
to a whole new level.

47:13.914 --> 47:17.417
Must be tricky if one person
is really rarin' to go

47:17.501 --> 47:20.671
and the other person
isn't quite as ready, right?

47:21.171 --> 47:22.548
Not my business, though.

47:22.631 --> 47:24.091
No.

47:24.174 --> 47:25.676
That's not my business at all.

47:27.761 --> 47:29.763
Like we said, picture perfect.

47:32.474 --> 47:33.475
What about you?

47:35.060 --> 47:38.063
You said before we didn't know
if the money was just for you.

47:38.897 --> 47:40.774
You're asking if I have a girlfriend?

47:42.109 --> 47:43.819
Or if there's anyone.

47:43.902 --> 47:44.903
Mm.

47:48.031 --> 47:50.284
You don't have to answer, obviously.

47:50.367 --> 47:51.869
Yeah. I'm not going to.

47:57.457 --> 47:58.584
You want that?

48:00.544 --> 48:01.461
[can pops]

48:09.219 --> 48:11.221
[clears throat] It's a lot for you.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.891
The, uh, the money that's coming.

48:15.100 --> 48:16.268
It's a lot for anybody.

48:17.644 --> 48:18.645
Should be.

48:21.481 --> 48:24.818
The way he was able to get
that much cash together so quickly…

48:26.945 --> 48:29.781
He said it was
for another Debbie, didn't he?

48:38.081 --> 48:39.291
You know what? Fuck it.

48:41.835 --> 48:42.961
I'll take one. [sighs]

48:43.045 --> 48:44.046
Oh.

48:48.675 --> 48:49.676
That's good.

48:57.559 --> 48:58.894
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

49:07.945 --> 49:11.239
[sighs] I'm supposed to be so grateful…

49:14.493 --> 49:16.370
and just take everything in stride,

49:17.496 --> 49:20.999
because… look at my life,

49:22.209 --> 49:23.752
and the good that I get to do.

49:25.587 --> 49:27.297
But, uh, the truth is, I…

49:29.091 --> 49:30.217
I miss my old life.

49:31.551 --> 49:36.598
[inhales] I miss my friends,
and I miss… feeling normal.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.725
-Okay, I'm sorry. I just--
-And, um--

49:39.977 --> 49:42.896
I'm sure you're a nice person,
but you're not some victim.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.027
You're just a person who made a trade.

49:49.111 --> 49:52.239
You know that, right?
You're just like the rest of us.

49:53.198 --> 49:55.200
I knew I wasn't marrying just him.

50:00.706 --> 50:01.832
I can remember…

50:04.001 --> 50:06.753
on my wedding day,
everyone was just waiting.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.758
And I was standing there,
staring down at my feet.

50:14.177 --> 50:17.597
And if I went forward,
if I walked down the aisle,

50:17.681 --> 50:21.727
I knew exactly what would happen
in the next 30 or 40 years.

50:23.311 --> 50:24.312
I knew.

50:25.397 --> 50:28.400
And if I went back,
if I didn't walk down the aisle,

50:28.483 --> 50:30.652
I-I wasn't sure what to expect.

50:32.779 --> 50:34.823
But it would have been mine.

50:35.824 --> 50:37.826
My choice and mine alone.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.621
Maybe for the very last time.

50:45.709 --> 50:46.710
I went forward.

50:48.628 --> 50:50.630
But if I'm being honest, I…

50:52.883 --> 50:55.802
I didn't know if I would
until I took that very first step.

51:01.099 --> 51:02.100
Well?

51:04.519 --> 51:05.520
Well, what?

51:06.229 --> 51:07.230
Was it worth it?

51:14.321 --> 51:16.323
Ask me again in 30 or 40 years.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.039
Um… [sighs] …all right, well,

51:25.207 --> 51:27.209
I, uh, I should get some sleep.

51:35.008 --> 51:36.009
Night.

52:17.843 --> 52:18.844
[exhales]

52:29.437 --> 52:30.438
[object scraping]

52:44.661 --> 52:45.662
Thanks.

52:48.623 --> 52:50.709
I'll take a Bloody Mary, too. Thanks.

52:59.968 --> 53:01.386
Wrong side of the bed, love?

53:02.053 --> 53:03.263
Was there a right side?

53:08.768 --> 53:09.603
[sniffs]

53:19.154 --> 53:21.156
[mysterious music playing]

53:32.500 --> 53:33.752
So, what company was it?

53:38.506 --> 53:39.341
[husband] Huh?

53:40.592 --> 53:42.052
You can't help yourself, huh?

53:44.638 --> 53:48.058
You were deemed… redundant,

53:49.226 --> 53:50.227
and let go.

53:51.645 --> 53:52.562
That's it, right?

53:53.313 --> 53:54.689
It's okay. You can tell me.

53:54.773 --> 53:56.566
I know what you're trying to do.

53:57.275 --> 53:58.276
Just drop it.

54:03.782 --> 54:06.576
Now, I owe you… something, right?

54:08.245 --> 54:09.913
If you owe a debt,

54:09.996 --> 54:12.415
it's to a hell of a lot more people
than just me.

54:13.458 --> 54:16.169
Because of your little math equation,

54:16.253 --> 54:18.588
people's jobs disappear
just like that. [snaps]

54:18.672 --> 54:22.467
-Don't even have time to prepare.
-Prepare for what, exactly?

54:24.844 --> 54:26.680
Ask the coal miners

54:26.763 --> 54:29.641
if they're prepared for clean energy.

54:30.976 --> 54:37.107
There's this new thing going around,
this new trendy mentality, you know, of…

54:39.109 --> 54:44.614
"I exist. So, therefore, you owe me."

54:46.449 --> 54:48.118
Are you familiar with this?

54:50.203 --> 54:52.872
That is the very reason why we live

54:53.707 --> 54:59.087
in a world full of
lazy fucking loafers and freeloaders.

55:00.213 --> 55:03.466
They're too busy
sitting, bitching, and moaning

55:04.426 --> 55:08.305
that when they're confronted
with an obstacle, it's just… [groans]

55:09.389 --> 55:11.016
[morosely] "I guess that's it."

55:13.059 --> 55:14.894
[cries mockingly]

55:15.895 --> 55:20.275
But I… recognized the opportunity.

55:21.151 --> 55:25.447
And I did something about it
every single fucking time.

55:27.365 --> 55:30.618
I didn't ask anyone for anything,

55:30.702 --> 55:34.664
and I didn't take anything
that wasn't fucking mine!

55:37.709 --> 55:40.170
Not everyone who needs help
is a freeloader.

55:44.382 --> 55:48.011
Babe, I was not referring
to you or your charity.

55:48.094 --> 55:49.721
It was not a personal attack.

55:49.804 --> 55:50.805
It is personal.

55:53.558 --> 55:55.560
I needed help. Okay?

55:56.686 --> 55:58.688
And you paid my student loans.

56:00.774 --> 56:01.775
Am I a freeloader?

56:03.276 --> 56:04.277
No.

56:06.571 --> 56:09.616
No, because you don't
think like that, do you?

56:13.161 --> 56:14.162
Do you?

56:17.040 --> 56:19.042
[rumbling]

56:20.502 --> 56:21.795
What the hell was that?

56:21.878 --> 56:23.380
[man] Everybody, be quiet.

56:23.463 --> 56:24.756
Don't say a fucking word.

56:28.968 --> 56:30.345
It's the fucking gardener.

56:30.428 --> 56:32.597
[suspenseful music playing]

56:32.680 --> 56:34.015
Okay, get into the office.

56:35.183 --> 56:37.185
Get into the fucking office right now!

56:39.687 --> 56:40.522
Go.

56:41.022 --> 56:41.856
Move!

56:43.775 --> 56:46.986
Go. All the way to the back.

56:52.075 --> 56:53.451
[breathing heavily]

56:53.535 --> 56:55.620
You didn't say anything
about a gardener coming today.

56:55.703 --> 56:56.830
We didn't know.

56:56.913 --> 56:57.997
What's he doing here?

56:58.081 --> 57:00.667
I don't know.
We don't deal with that kind of stuff.

57:05.505 --> 57:08.216
[suspenseful music continues]

57:08.299 --> 57:10.051
He's coming. He's coming.

57:10.635 --> 57:13.388
Just-- Everybody, be fucking quiet, okay?

57:16.516 --> 57:17.517
[knocking at door]

57:22.063 --> 57:22.939
[knocking]

57:26.526 --> 57:29.320
-[knocking continues]
-He's just gonna keep knocking.

57:29.404 --> 57:30.447
He sees our car.

57:30.530 --> 57:33.408
Just-- Will you give him
a chance to tire himself out?

57:33.491 --> 57:34.576
[knocking continues]

57:41.040 --> 57:42.459
[knocking continues]

57:42.542 --> 57:45.003
-Want me to go talk to him?
-Yeah. Get rid of him.

57:45.503 --> 57:47.088
[husband] Fucking fix everything.

57:47.172 --> 57:50.550
Hey, we are this close.

57:50.633 --> 57:53.344
Do not fuck this up for us, okay?

57:58.224 --> 57:59.225
Hola.

58:00.977 --> 58:02.103
[gardener] Hello, sir.

58:02.187 --> 58:05.690
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I, uh, I saw that… that you're here.

58:05.773 --> 58:08.276
Yes. We're here. How may I help you?

58:08.359 --> 58:11.738
[gardener] Uh,
since you're not always here at home,

58:11.821 --> 58:15.700
I… I wanted to be able
to say thank you myself.

58:16.409 --> 58:17.410
You're very welcome.

58:17.494 --> 58:21.372
It's such a pleasure
to, uh, work on such a beautiful property,

58:21.456 --> 58:26.002
and I wanted to say to you
and to your wife, uh… uh, gracias.

58:26.085 --> 58:28.004
Ah, you're too kind.

58:28.087 --> 58:30.965
And it's nice to meet you, see you--

58:31.049 --> 58:34.177
-I don't mean to bother you--
-Gracias. I'll pass it along. No.

58:35.386 --> 58:37.305
-You're welcome.
-Shut up.

58:37.388 --> 58:40.683
Shut up. Go to the bedroom.
Both of you. Bedroom.

58:43.186 --> 58:45.188
[loud whirring]

58:49.984 --> 58:51.903
How long is this guy going to be here?

58:51.986 --> 58:54.155
[husband] Until he's done, I suppose.

59:00.119 --> 59:02.121
[loud whirring continuing]

59:28.356 --> 59:29.440
[loud whirring stops]

59:45.999 --> 59:47.000
Shit.

59:49.294 --> 59:50.295
I think he saw me.

59:51.379 --> 59:52.589
[knocking at door]

59:52.672 --> 59:56.092
[husband laughing]

1:00:02.015 --> 1:00:05.059
-Hello again.
-I'm-I'm so sorry to bother you again.

1:00:05.143 --> 1:00:07.395
-Not at all. You remember my wife.
-Of course.

1:00:07.478 --> 1:00:09.063
-Señora.
-[wife] Hi. How are you?

1:00:09.814 --> 1:00:14.611
And, uh, this is her cousin.
He just flew in from Portofino.

1:00:17.155 --> 1:00:20.491
-It's nice you have family here.
-[husband] Yes. That's everything.

1:00:20.575 --> 1:00:22.118
Señor, while you're here,

1:00:22.201 --> 1:00:23.870
there's this one thing
I want to show you.

1:00:23.953 --> 1:00:25.580
It would just take one minute.

1:00:26.372 --> 1:00:28.374
-You know--
-No, how about we all go?

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:31.294
-[gardener] Oh. Okay, yes.
-Let's all go.

1:00:31.377 --> 1:00:34.505
The more the better.
[gardener laughs] Follow me. This way.

1:00:35.423 --> 1:00:39.052
-[husband] So, what are we looking at?
-I'll show you. Around the corner.

1:00:39.135 --> 1:00:41.387
Uh, you must have had a really nice drive,

1:00:41.471 --> 1:00:43.723
because the, uh, weather has been so nice.

1:00:43.806 --> 1:00:46.517
-It was a beautiful--
-Hey, you know what, guys? Uh…

1:00:47.685 --> 1:00:49.854
We just put food in the oven.
We have to get back inside.

1:00:49.937 --> 1:00:52.190
That can wait.
What did you want to show me?

1:00:52.273 --> 1:00:54.484
I don't know
if you've been able to see this,

1:00:54.567 --> 1:00:58.863
but, uh, I designed and I-I built
and-and I put these planters here.

1:00:58.946 --> 1:01:03.785
Uh, it took me 18 weeks,
but, uh,  I think it was worth it.

1:01:03.868 --> 1:01:06.913
And… next, I was imagining,

1:01:06.996 --> 1:01:08.539
with your permission,

1:01:08.623 --> 1:01:14.379
right here, a beautiful, beautiful
big oak tree, right in the center.

1:01:14.462 --> 1:01:17.548
-[husband] Huh.
-I did do a little, simple sketch for you

1:01:17.632 --> 1:01:20.176
to show you what, uh, my vision is. Uh--

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:24.305
It-It will take some time
for it to grow, of course,

1:01:24.389 --> 1:01:26.224
but I was thinking that, you know,

1:01:26.307 --> 1:01:28.601
this is not just something
for you to enjoy.

1:01:28.685 --> 1:01:30.937
Your children
and your children's children.

1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:32.021
Yeah.

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:35.316
Our children's children, baby. Wow.

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:36.901
-That's-- Wow.
-[chuckles]

1:01:36.984 --> 1:01:41.322
I think that's why I drew
my… my kids right here by the tree.

1:01:41.406 --> 1:01:43.449
-My boy and my girl.
-I see that.

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:45.660
And I showed this
to the landscape person,

1:01:45.743 --> 1:01:46.953
but, um, you know--

1:01:47.036 --> 1:01:50.748
So, you're telling me
that you designed all of this

1:01:50.832 --> 1:01:52.125
and built this yourself?

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:53.668
-Sí, señor.
-Wow.

1:01:54.335 --> 1:01:57.380
My friend, I have to say,
this is very impressive.

1:01:57.463 --> 1:01:59.215
-Thank you, sir.
-Beautiful work.

1:01:59.298 --> 1:02:00.174
It's very pretty.

1:02:00.258 --> 1:02:03.094
Well, uh, if you like it,
maybe you can sign off on it.

1:02:06.681 --> 1:02:07.515
Oh.

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:11.185
Just the, uh--

1:02:11.894 --> 1:02:12.854
It's time to go inside.

1:02:12.937 --> 1:02:14.856
-The tree--
-[wife] Food's ready, love.

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.232
-Right.
-Hey, now.

1:02:16.315 --> 1:02:17.608
[husband] Right.

1:02:17.692 --> 1:02:19.193
-In the middle--
-Thank you so much.

1:02:19.277 --> 1:02:20.445
-We have to go.
-Let's go back.

1:02:20.528 --> 1:02:22.822
There is one more thing on this side.

1:02:22.905 --> 1:02:24.615
We're gonna have to do that later.

1:02:25.241 --> 1:02:28.327
-Thank you. I'm sorry. [wife chuckles]
-[gardener] It will only take a minute.

1:02:28.411 --> 1:02:29.412
Sorry.

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:36.377
[husband] You could learn something
from this guy, buddy.

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:38.463
[tense music playing]

1:02:39.672 --> 1:02:43.342
He takes initiative,
he takes pride in what he does,

1:02:43.426 --> 1:02:46.095
and he does it all
with a smile on his face.

1:02:46.179 --> 1:02:47.096
Imagine that.

1:02:48.264 --> 1:02:51.225
Guy's a go-getter.
He doesn't wait around for permission.

1:02:52.977 --> 1:02:53.811
Hey.

1:02:54.854 --> 1:02:55.855
Hey, buddy.

1:02:56.814 --> 1:02:58.775
Got about eight hours left.

1:02:59.275 --> 1:03:03.488
Should we play
some board games or charades or--

1:03:03.571 --> 1:03:06.407
Hey, are you even listening to me, buddy?

1:03:09.202 --> 1:03:10.536
Do you not hear me?

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:13.539
[tense music playing]

1:03:15.291 --> 1:03:18.586
Wh-What should we do
for the next eight hours or so? Huh?

1:03:20.379 --> 1:03:22.882
Hey, excuse me,
can I talk to you for a second?

1:03:23.758 --> 1:03:24.717
Stop!

1:03:33.643 --> 1:03:34.685
I can't let you.

1:03:51.744 --> 1:03:53.830
[man] Shit!

1:03:56.457 --> 1:03:57.458
Shit!

1:03:59.502 --> 1:04:00.503
This is on you.

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:03.172
Not me. This is on you.

1:04:03.256 --> 1:04:06.509
You break into my house
and it's somehow my fault?

1:04:06.592 --> 1:04:09.220
-That's what you're saying?
-Why would you do that?

1:04:09.303 --> 1:04:12.598
[husband exhales]
I don't know. He doesn't live here.

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:15.685
We don't know him.
Uh, I'm tired of looking at his face.

1:04:15.768 --> 1:04:19.897
Um… he has so many bright ideas,
maybe he decides he wants to tie us both

1:04:19.981 --> 1:04:23.401
to a fucking orange tree, babe.
We don't know what he's going to do--

1:04:23.484 --> 1:04:24.402
I would've left!

1:04:28.948 --> 1:04:29.949
I don't believe him.

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:35.830
But my main priority is to my wife, okay?

1:04:35.913 --> 1:04:36.914
[laughs]

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:39.083
Main priority?

1:04:40.835 --> 1:04:43.546
You did something that jeopardized me

1:04:44.338 --> 1:04:46.340
and him and him.

1:04:46.424 --> 1:04:49.635
-[husband groans]
-All of us. You-You chose for all of us.

1:04:49.719 --> 1:04:53.347
Okay. So, what are you suggesting?
That in that split second that it took

1:04:53.431 --> 1:04:57.935
for me to scribble down this note
that I lean over and-and consult with you?

1:04:58.019 --> 1:05:01.272
No, because you've never involved me
in any decision you've made.

1:05:01.355 --> 1:05:02.565
What made this any different?

1:05:02.648 --> 1:05:06.986
So, i-it's back to this.
I'm just a piece of shit, right?

1:05:07.069 --> 1:05:08.154
I'm a piece of shit.

1:05:09.614 --> 1:05:11.032
I'm just a piece of shit.

1:05:11.782 --> 1:05:17.038
I-I make one calculated risk
to try and protect us--

1:05:17.622 --> 1:05:19.665
Yeah. And how'd that work out for you?

1:05:22.043 --> 1:05:23.586
The fuck is happening here?

1:05:26.964 --> 1:05:29.967
Just hang tight, okay?
This will be over in a few hours.

1:05:34.847 --> 1:05:36.641
What happens in a few hours?

1:05:37.767 --> 1:05:39.352
He takes a lot of my money.

1:05:40.227 --> 1:05:41.354
I'm so sorry.

1:05:53.449 --> 1:05:56.285
[tense music playing]

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:05.688
[sighs]

1:07:30.004 --> 1:07:34.216
Why do we keep pretending
that this guy is an actual threat?

1:07:34.300 --> 1:07:36.302
[breathing heavily]

1:07:53.736 --> 1:07:54.987
I'm going to leave now.

1:07:56.447 --> 1:07:57.990
Hey! No, no, no, no.

1:07:58.491 --> 1:08:01.202
Sit back down on the couch.
Hey. We're all tired.

1:08:01.285 --> 1:08:03.412
I'm being nice to you right now. Sit down.

1:08:10.294 --> 1:08:11.587
What is this, really?

1:08:12.254 --> 1:08:13.255
Hmm?

1:08:14.632 --> 1:08:15.716
Do you wanna be me?

1:08:16.467 --> 1:08:17.468
Is that it?

1:08:19.428 --> 1:08:23.224
Because let me fucking tell you,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

1:08:23.307 --> 1:08:25.434
Try being a rich white guy these days.

1:08:26.102 --> 1:08:29.021
Everyone always thinks
it must be real fucking nice.

1:08:29.814 --> 1:08:31.273
That's what you think, right?

1:08:31.774 --> 1:08:34.860
But you have no idea

1:08:34.944 --> 1:08:37.321
what I deal with every day.

1:08:37.404 --> 1:08:40.533
There's a fucking permanent target
on my back,

1:08:40.616 --> 1:08:46.622
and infinite nothing people out there
just waiting for me to fail.

1:08:47.123 --> 1:08:48.374
Fucking sucks!

1:08:50.835 --> 1:08:52.128
It's fucking pathetic.

1:08:52.962 --> 1:08:54.964
Th-That's you, right?

1:08:55.047 --> 1:08:56.465
You're pathetic.

1:08:56.549 --> 1:08:58.092
Just leave him alone.

1:08:58.592 --> 1:08:59.593
[husband] What?

1:09:01.637 --> 1:09:03.722
Just leave him alone.

1:09:03.806 --> 1:09:04.807
Leave him alone?

1:09:07.393 --> 1:09:08.394
This guy?

1:09:10.688 --> 1:09:16.152
I've had to hold his hand
for the last 36 hours and help him rob me.

1:09:18.362 --> 1:09:19.488
Why? Why?

1:09:20.614 --> 1:09:23.117
Fucking why am I doing this? Enough!

1:09:24.285 --> 1:09:27.413
He just wanted to know
what it was like to have a little power

1:09:28.122 --> 1:09:30.166
in his fucking meaningless existence.

1:09:30.749 --> 1:09:32.251
Oh, I just-- I don't buy it.

1:09:32.334 --> 1:09:33.669
You can't even act it.

1:09:33.752 --> 1:09:35.254
It's really sad. So…

1:09:38.132 --> 1:09:41.302
-I'm going to walk out the door.
-Sit on the fucking couch now.

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:42.845
[menacing music playing]

1:09:42.928 --> 1:09:45.055
[husband chuckling]

1:09:45.139 --> 1:09:48.392
I just-- I don't believe you.
I don't think you're going to do it.

1:09:48.475 --> 1:09:52.605
I don't think you're going to do it now.
I don't think you're going to do anything.

1:09:54.148 --> 1:09:55.149
Ever.

1:09:55.232 --> 1:09:57.443
In your entire fucking life.

1:09:58.569 --> 1:09:59.570
Because…

1:10:00.988 --> 1:10:03.949
-You listening?
-Just sit down on the fucking couch!

1:10:04.033 --> 1:10:05.284
[husband] You listening?

1:10:05.367 --> 1:10:06.368
Yeah?

1:10:06.869 --> 1:10:08.078
You're nothing.

1:10:09.830 --> 1:10:10.748
You hear that?

1:10:11.332 --> 1:10:12.875
Say it. Nothing.

1:10:14.251 --> 1:10:15.085
Nothing.

1:10:36.899 --> 1:10:37.775
Oh!

1:10:39.026 --> 1:10:41.779
-[husband Oh, shit! Oh!
-[man] No, no, no, no. No.

1:10:42.488 --> 1:10:44.949

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:47.243
[husband] Oh!

1:10:49.203 --> 1:10:51.080
[husband groans] Oh, shit!

1:10:52.706 --> 1:10:54.166
No. No, no, no, no.

1:10:55.084 --> 1:10:56.335
Fuck!

1:10:56.418 --> 1:11:01.173
-Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Just don't move.
-[husband] Not fucking real. Not real.

1:11:01.257 --> 1:11:03.133
Not real. It's not real.

1:11:03.217 --> 1:11:04.802
-It's not real.
-Do something!

1:11:04.885 --> 1:11:06.178
What? What? What?

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:09.223
I don't know! Just help me, please!
Come on, goddamn it!

1:11:09.306 --> 1:11:11.809
Why would you run through
a glass fucking door?

1:11:11.892 --> 1:11:13.894
No, no, no! Please!

1:11:13.978 --> 1:11:16.981
-Hey, fucking help me!
-What the fuck do you want me to do?

1:11:17.898 --> 1:11:18.899
Fuck!

1:11:22.236 --> 1:11:23.529
The guy's fucking dead.

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:23.565
[whimpering]

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:47.423
What happened was an accident.

1:13:48.799 --> 1:13:50.050
It was a terrible thing.

1:13:52.219 --> 1:13:54.680
And I know that you're feeling
the weight of it.

1:13:55.973 --> 1:13:56.890
We all are.

1:13:57.850 --> 1:14:00.769
But there's a… a huge difference

1:14:02.229 --> 1:14:05.524
between what just happened
and what you think you have to do next.

1:14:08.861 --> 1:14:10.404
Please don't cross that line.

1:14:11.405 --> 1:14:14.116
I-I-I can call someone right now

1:14:14.867 --> 1:14:16.785
that handles this sort of thing.

1:14:16.869 --> 1:14:19.955
I can fix a problem like this.
I can call someone right now.

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:23.834
-Let me call someone. Let me call someone.
-Hey. Hey. Look at me.

1:14:26.253 --> 1:14:27.254
Look at me.

1:14:30.799 --> 1:14:32.259
You're a good person.

1:14:34.094 --> 1:14:35.095
I know.

1:14:35.762 --> 1:14:37.514
I know that you're a good person.

1:14:38.390 --> 1:14:40.642
But there's a step
that you haven't taken yet,

1:14:40.726 --> 1:14:41.935
and if you do,

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:45.314
you'll never be the same again.

1:14:46.565 --> 1:14:47.483
Trust me.

1:14:50.569 --> 1:14:51.778
You're not a killer.

1:14:57.618 --> 1:14:59.620

1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:36.281
Money's here.

1:15:47.209 --> 1:15:48.293
What are you doing?

1:15:49.586 --> 1:15:50.671
You're going.

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:23.120

1:19:42.194 --> 1:19:43.195
[husband] Babe?

1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:49.201
Babe?

1:19:53.997 --> 1:19:55.290
You okay in there?

1:19:57.125 --> 1:19:58.126
Hello?

1:20:01.838 --> 1:20:03.840
We're going to get out of here

1:20:05.008 --> 1:20:07.844
and then we'll go wherever you want, babe.

1:20:09.012 --> 1:20:10.055
We'll start over.

1:20:14.100 --> 1:20:16.478
We could go to the vineyard
and renew our vows.

1:20:16.561 --> 1:20:17.687
How 'bout that, huh?

1:20:19.564 --> 1:20:20.565
You like that?

1:20:23.777 --> 1:20:25.946
It's gonna be okay.

1:20:28.657 --> 1:20:30.784
-Hello?
-[footsteps approaching]

1:20:30.867 --> 1:20:31.868
[husband] Nothing?

1:20:47.092 --> 1:20:48.093
Goodbye.

1:20:50.679 --> 1:20:51.805
[wife] It was a rose.

1:20:53.515 --> 1:20:54.516
I'm sorry, what?

1:20:56.142 --> 1:20:57.143
My tattoo.

1:20:58.895 --> 1:20:59.896
It was a rose.

1:21:02.399 --> 1:21:03.400
And I liked it.

1:21:08.905 --> 1:21:09.990
I don't give a fuck.

1:21:17.873 --> 1:21:20.542
[husband groaning]

1:21:44.691 --> 1:21:46.151
[husband] Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

1:22:02.751 --> 1:22:05.545
[tense music plays]

1:22:25.523 --> 1:22:26.524
You were right.

1:22:30.904 --> 1:22:33.448
I wanted to know
what it would feel like to be you,

1:22:33.990 --> 1:22:34.950
and so I came here.

1:22:39.829 --> 1:22:41.331
And then you showed up.

1:22:44.793 --> 1:22:49.005
And deep down,
I really wanted you to be good,

1:22:49.089 --> 1:22:52.425
because then at least
things might make sense.

1:22:55.804 --> 1:22:57.806
Life might feel more fair.

1:22:58.598 --> 1:23:00.100
And then I saw you,

1:23:01.393 --> 1:23:02.352
the real you,

1:23:03.061 --> 1:23:04.646
and you're so disgusting.

1:23:07.941 --> 1:23:09.275
I feel sick.

1:23:11.736 --> 1:23:13.905
And nothing feels fair.

1:23:15.782 --> 1:23:18.284
You have everything, and I have nothing!

1:23:28.128 --> 1:23:29.921
At least you're alone, though.

1:23:30.422 --> 1:23:31.631
So I get to have that.

1:23:32.549 --> 1:23:33.383
Right?

1:23:34.467 --> 1:23:35.468
I can pity you.

1:23:37.971 --> 1:23:39.514
You're always gonna be alone.

1:23:42.475 --> 1:23:44.477
Because I know something you don't know.

Hey, babe!

Did you just fucking kill him?

1:25:25.286 --> 1:25:26.704
You just fucking killed him.
