00:08.008 --> 00:12.534
My name is Lisa Guerrero.
Playboy, in many ways,

00:12.621 --> 00:14.405
is the reason
I am where I am today.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.755
Why would you try to take
advantage of young women?

00:16.842 --> 00:18.540
<i>You might have seen me</i> <i>
on "Inside Edition."</i>

00:18.670 --> 00:20.629
Were you trying
to rip me off?

00:20.759 --> 00:25.025
<i>In my early 20s, I was</i> <i>
a "Playboy" lingerie model.</i>

00:25.112 --> 00:26.765
<i>20 years later,</i>

00:26.896 --> 00:29.768
<i>I became a celebrity cover model</i> <i>
for "Playboy"</i>

00:29.899 --> 00:32.554
<i>in January of 2006.</i>

00:32.641 --> 00:36.297
<i>This series is about women</i> <i>
like me,</i>

00:36.384 --> 00:38.429
<i>who have an association</i> <i>
with "Playboy"</i>

00:38.560 --> 00:40.823
<i>but are now looking back</i> <i>
and questioning</i>

00:40.910 --> 00:43.086
<i>some really serious things.</i>

00:43.173 --> 00:45.349
<i>They've bravely shared</i> <i>
their stories,</i>

00:45.480 --> 00:48.004
<i>but the backlash has been swift.</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:52.487
<i>Tonight, they'll share</i> <i>
the aftermath of speaking out.</i>

00:59.320 --> 01:02.410
My name is Sondra Theodore,

01:02.497 --> 01:04.847
and I was Hef's girlfriend
in the '70s and early '80s

01:04.977 --> 01:07.241
for five years.

01:07.328 --> 01:12.028
It was like living a fairy tale,
and...he made me believe it,

01:12.159 --> 01:14.683
and everybody else did, too,

01:14.770 --> 01:16.815
'cause I don't know if they--
they all felt like

01:16.902 --> 01:23.300
it was a fairy tale, too,
that we were so in love.

01:23.387 --> 01:27.565
I would have never thought
she would speak about Hef,

01:27.652 --> 01:30.612
'cause boy,
was she loyal to him.

01:30.699 --> 01:36.183
Hefner--he broke me like
you would break a horse.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.229
Hef used, uh, cocaine.
He had a drawerful of drugs.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.841
The drugs fueled how many people
you could get in your bed,

01:42.972 --> 01:44.974
and all of a sudden,
there's three of us,

01:45.061 --> 01:47.585
and three girls became five,
and it got ridiculous up there.

01:47.716 --> 01:51.285
He twisted my mind so much that

01:51.372 --> 01:55.724
if I loved him, that proved
how much I loved him.

01:55.811 --> 01:59.684
And I didn't wanna be
with those people.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.470
He scared me a lot
at the end,

02:02.557 --> 02:05.473
because you--you couldn't
satisfy him.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.736
He had to have more and more
and more.

02:07.823 --> 02:11.522
You know, pretty wild.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.571
One of the misconceptions

02:16.658 --> 02:18.529
that some audience members
might have...

02:18.616 --> 02:19.661
- Uh-huh.
- ...is, you know,

02:19.748 --> 02:21.489
why didn't you tell this story
earlier?

02:21.576 --> 02:24.492
Because if I admitted it,

02:24.622 --> 02:26.798
it made my story--
the fairy tale,

02:26.929 --> 02:29.061
turn into a nightmare, and--

02:29.192 --> 02:31.934
and so many people
counted on that fairy tale

02:32.021 --> 02:33.327
like my own children.

02:34.893 --> 02:37.200
thinking I had been a princess,
at thyou know?res,

02:37.287 --> 02:39.028
When most people break up
with somebody...

02:39.115 --> 02:40.334
- Mm-hmm.
- ...they move on.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.728
They're not involved
- Thwith their families.in.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.861
They don't go back
for reunions.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.471
- Your situation was different.
- Yeah.

02:47.558 --> 02:51.171
Because when you
and Hef broke up,

02:51.301 --> 02:53.608
you continued to be part
of his life.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.393
Yeah. You know,
I'm not even sure how--

02:56.480 --> 02:58.439
how I ended up back there,

02:58.569 --> 03:00.615
because it was a painful
breakup, but I did.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.618
I ran from the bad by

03:03.705 --> 03:05.881
working really hard at being
normal, by getting married.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.622
On my wedding day,
I thought, "See?

03:07.752 --> 03:11.147
See? I did it.
I was able to get married."

03:11.234 --> 03:13.802
Hef came to my wedding, and he
gave me my wedding reception,

03:13.932 --> 03:15.369
and the pictures.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.371
- You married one of his friends.
- Yeah.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.024
He was in the business.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.287
He ended up handling a lot
of the Playmates.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.246
He understood me
and what I'd been through.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.205
So I didn't have
to explain myself,

03:25.335 --> 03:27.381
and for a while,
we had a great life.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.992
We have two beautiful children,

03:30.079 --> 03:31.994
and forever grateful for them.

03:32.081 --> 03:35.258
All the girlfriends came back.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.826
We brought our children up
for Easter.

03:37.956 --> 03:41.308
Easter was very family-oriented,
and so that really helped

03:41.438 --> 03:43.571
make everything okay.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.443
It was the only family we knew.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.577
20 years
after we'd been together,

03:49.664 --> 03:52.797
if I showed up, Hef would make
a big show of "Here she is"

03:52.884 --> 03:56.845
and the fake,
"I'm about ready to cry."

03:56.975 --> 03:58.455
And so you believe it.
You get sucked back into it,

03:58.586 --> 04:01.806
and all the bad things--
you think,

04:01.893 --> 04:04.592
"Well, everybody else thinks
he's okay. He's great.

04:04.722 --> 04:08.030
So maybe it's me."
He was that good.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.990
It's charm
and smoke and mirrors.

04:12.077 --> 04:14.384
Everybody kept it alive--
that fantasy.

04:14.515 --> 04:15.516
- And you bought into this.
- -I bought--
- Well, yeah--

04:15.603 --> 04:17.605
- Forever.
- Forever.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.390
you brought your kids back.
- FYou kept going back.rs,

04:22.566 --> 04:25.047
...with these women. You kept
in touch with them until what?

04:25.177 --> 04:27.441
What was the breaking point
for you where you said,

04:27.528 --> 04:30.966
"Enough. I'm not going to play
into this fantasy anymore"?

04:31.096 --> 04:32.620
It was a long journey
to get here.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.492
I had nobody to talk to
back then.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.842
And then I saw him
indoctrinating my daughter.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.627
Wait. What?

04:39.714 --> 04:42.194
Well, he never touched her,
or I would've killed him.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.371
But the same thing--
when she would walk in,

04:44.501 --> 04:46.721
he singles her out
and made her feel special,

04:46.808 --> 04:48.026
and I'd say to him,
"You can't have her.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.506
Don't you touch her."

04:49.593 --> 04:51.813
And, um...

04:51.900 --> 04:56.165
And...

04:56.252 --> 04:59.516
That's obviously
a really difficult thing

04:59.647 --> 05:01.866
for you to remember.
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.825
Because if he had touched her,

05:03.955 --> 05:08.308
I would just have died. Um...

05:08.438 --> 05:11.311
You knew more than anybody
how dark...

05:11.398 --> 05:13.704
- Yeah.
- ...Hugh Hefner really was...

05:13.835 --> 05:15.184
Yeah.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.534
...and that there were
no boundaries.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.231
- Nowhere.
- Would you have been surprised

05:19.319 --> 05:21.277
if he would have tried
to lure your daughter in?

05:21.408 --> 05:25.455
He would've. He would've.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.588
One of the things I was
interested in asking you about

05:27.675 --> 05:30.808
is how your family reacted
to your story,

05:30.939 --> 05:33.289
specifically your daughter.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.509
It was not easy.
It was not good.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.555
I'm saying these things,
and she's so confused.

05:38.642 --> 05:42.864
We went through many years of
I was feeling like an outcast

05:42.951 --> 05:45.519
from my family, because I didn't
have the support of them

05:45.606 --> 05:47.521
in the beginning.

05:47.608 --> 05:48.826
They loved me
and they wanted to support me,

05:48.913 --> 05:50.611
but they didn't understand it.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.482
They couldn't--
They couldn't go there.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.745
By the end of the documentary,
they finally came around,

05:54.832 --> 05:56.312
when their father finally said
to my daughter,

05:56.399 --> 05:59.359
"Hef wasn't always a good guy.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.012
He did some bad things
to your mother,"

06:01.099 --> 06:02.927
and that was the moment

06:03.014 --> 06:05.669
she was able to let go
of the fairy tale, too,

06:05.756 --> 06:09.586
and that was really a huge,
huge breaking point for us,

06:09.673 --> 06:13.329
for my child to accept it.

06:13.416 --> 06:17.072
I wanna ask you
about the Playboy family.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.509
Can you describe
some of the backlash,

06:19.640 --> 06:20.292
once you told the story?
- Yeah.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.207
What has that been like?

06:22.294 --> 06:24.122
I'm being chewed up
and spit up by my own.

06:24.253 --> 06:27.038
Not one of them picked up
the phone to ask me why

06:27.125 --> 06:29.301
I was doing this.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.479
They're afraid
to be shunned themselves.

06:32.566 --> 06:36.526
I loved a lot of those girls.
We were lifetime friends.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.789
And to walk away from them,

06:38.920 --> 06:42.793
self-exile was very hard
because that's all I knew.

06:44.752 --> 06:48.103
Tell me about the first time
you went online

06:48.233 --> 06:49.800
and saw the reaction
to your story.

06:49.887 --> 06:53.630
Ugh. The warrior in me
wanted to just write back

06:53.761 --> 06:56.024
and say, "Are you kidding me?"
But I, you know,

06:56.154 --> 06:58.330
I just stopped myself.
I thought, this will play out,

06:58.461 --> 07:00.376
and hopefully, by the end
of the documentary,

07:00.463 --> 07:02.509
they will see the whole picture,

07:02.639 --> 07:05.033
and they'll have to come
to their own truth.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.818
- And--
- And they need to respect mine,

07:07.949 --> 07:12.780
because nobody can tell you
your story's a lie,

07:12.867 --> 07:16.044
because it's not their story.
Um, I'm not attacking them.

07:16.174 --> 07:20.440
I'm just bringing to light
another part of the reality.

07:20.527 --> 07:24.748
- Your identity for decades...
- Yeah.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.968
Was connected to--to Hugh Hefner
and this Playboy brand.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.710
Yeah.
And to say that it was a lie,

07:29.797 --> 07:32.452
that "I was hurt,"
that "I saw other people hurt,"

07:32.539 --> 07:34.236
that "I saw <i>him</i> hurting
other people"...

07:34.323 --> 07:36.151
Yeah.

07:36.281 --> 07:39.676
...that is a big, brave,
bold thing to do.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.504
Thank you.

07:41.591 --> 07:44.725
And there are some people
who support you.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.162
Yeah.

07:47.249 --> 07:50.295
Lisa Loving Barrett is somebody
you haven't seen in a while,

07:50.382 --> 07:52.776
and she plays an essential part
of your...

07:52.863 --> 07:54.256
- Story.
- ...story, really.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.997
- Yes. Yeah.
- And so are you ready to...

07:57.825 --> 07:59.000
- Yes, I am so ready.
- Here's Lisa Loving Barrett.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.871
Oh, my God.

08:00.958 --> 08:04.222
- It's been a minute.
- It's been a minute.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.006
I don't know if I wanna hug you
or feed you.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.534
One of the things that I loved
about the documentary

08:11.621 --> 08:15.277
was how you women connected
through something

08:15.364 --> 08:18.062
that was a little dark, Lisa.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.717
What was your role there
before you met Sondra?

08:20.848 --> 08:23.415
I actually was working
part-time under the table,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.635
helping someone invite people
up for the movies

08:25.722 --> 08:28.812
for Fridays and Sunday evenings,

08:28.899 --> 08:32.642
and I did that for months
until I was introduced to Mary.

08:32.729 --> 08:36.080
She was ready for an assistant,
so I segued into that position.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.691
Hef came to me and said,
"I've hired this secretary

08:37.778 --> 08:41.433
that--she's your age,
and I think--

08:41.521 --> 08:42.696
I think you'll really like her,
and I thought

08:42.826 --> 08:44.959
that maybe you guys
could hang out."

08:45.089 --> 08:48.615
And I didn't think
that I was hired to spy on her.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.400
It segued into this thing
where Hef was saying,

08:51.531 --> 08:52.967
"What are you doing
Tuesday night?

08:53.097 --> 08:54.882
Why don't you and Sondra go do
something Tuesday night?"

08:54.969 --> 08:56.536
But he would say on Wednesdays,

08:56.666 --> 08:58.668
"Oh, what'd you girls do
last night?"

08:58.755 --> 09:02.063
It didn't feel bad to say,
"Oh, no, we had a great time"

09:02.193 --> 09:04.239
and kind of recant
what we had done.

09:04.326 --> 09:08.460
And it wasn't until it started
to feel a little bit invasive

09:08.591 --> 09:11.899
that I finally just had to say,
"I can't do this.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.684
I can't come back
and report to you."

09:14.771 --> 09:19.602
Was he jealous? Was he worried
that she was cheating on him?

09:19.689 --> 09:20.516
What do you think
he was worried about?

09:20.647 --> 09:23.737
All of the above. Attention.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.347
- Period?
- Yeah. Yeah, don't you think?

09:25.477 --> 09:26.957
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.916
It drove him nuts when he
thought of me having fun

09:29.046 --> 09:34.182
outside of his clutches,
you know?

09:34.269 --> 09:38.055
DiYeah. What he was doing wasg
otry to open up the timeslots.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.841
He had other things to do.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.191
Other people to do.

09:43.321 --> 09:46.673
And that was heartbreaking
for me, and she saw it all.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.110
You know, she saw the pain
that it caused me.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.764
She told me a great story

09:50.851 --> 09:52.287
I had completely forgotten about
on Thanksgiving.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.462
- What's the story? Tell me.
- On Thanksgiving.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.595
It's Thanksgiving,
and we're partying.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.206
We're cooking
in my little 2-bedroom,

09:58.336 --> 10:01.252
above-a-garage apartment.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.298
It's very innocent but very fun,

10:03.385 --> 10:07.519
and Mary called and said
Hef wanted to talk to Sondra.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.696
About five minutes
after you hung up from him,

10:09.783 --> 10:11.480
Mary called back and said,
"Hef's coming over.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.700
He wants to hang out
with you girls."

10:13.830 --> 10:17.704
He left whomever he was with
to be with <i>me.</i>

10:17.791 --> 10:22.317
So before Hef comes
a little car with a butler

10:22.404 --> 10:24.014
who brought in satin sheets.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.669
He goes into my bedroom
and remakes my bed.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.976
- With his sheets?
- Yes.

10:29.063 --> 10:32.283
Yes, with these satin sheets.
So then a few minutes later,

10:32.370 --> 10:33.894
security knocked at the door,

10:33.981 --> 10:37.854
and Hef came into my bedroom
with Sondra.

10:37.985 --> 10:42.337
So I left, and about an hour,
Hef came back out.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.514
So I scurried around upstairs
and peeled her off the sheets.

10:45.645 --> 10:50.388
I have to say,
that just sounds so dark.

10:50.519 --> 10:53.000
- And it was disrespectful.
- It was all about him.

10:53.130 --> 10:57.352
It went
from being fun and adoring

10:57.439 --> 11:00.094
to being exhausting and abusive.
- Uh-huh.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.666
Lisa, now as you look back,
do you have any regrets

11:06.753 --> 11:08.145
about your participation?

11:08.276 --> 11:10.104
- I do not.
- No regrets?

11:10.191 --> 11:12.715
I do not. I have no regrets.

11:12.802 --> 11:17.764
I didn't have a-a perspective
of evil or wrongdoing

11:17.894 --> 11:19.461
at that point.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.116
Okay, but what is your response
to people today

11:22.203 --> 11:24.901
that say, "You worked for him.
You should have known this"?

11:24.988 --> 11:27.687
Well, I mean, look, it was
very homogenized then.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.993
It was made okay. It made--

11:30.080 --> 11:31.342
It was okay for me to tell
my grandparents

11:31.429 --> 11:34.128
that I worked at Playboy.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.826
From an experience perspective,
it's easy to see it differently.

11:36.913 --> 11:42.614
With Sondra, I saw a hopeful
young woman in love.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.355
I loved him,
and I kept thinking,

11:44.442 --> 11:46.967
"He'll tire of this,
it'll change."

11:47.054 --> 11:49.883
And 'cause he was telling me,
"We'll be together forever,"

11:50.013 --> 11:53.625
and I was the first girl he'd
like to have a baby together.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.324
He didn't just walk in one day
and start doing, you know...

11:56.411 --> 11:57.542
- Yeah.
- ...monstrous things.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.849
- -It was--
- It was an evolution.
- Yeah.

11:59.936 --> 12:03.766
And the more she gave him,
the more he wanted...

12:03.897 --> 12:05.420
Yeah.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.422
...the more he needed,
the more he expected.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.819
This picture, I'm being silly.
- I'm--
- I'm happy.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.212
- Yeah.
- And in this picture,

12:15.299 --> 12:18.433
he's whispering in my ear,
isn't he?

12:18.563 --> 12:20.304
I wonder what he's saying.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.742
And then you look at my face
in that one.

12:22.829 --> 12:26.006
I'd been told to go up
and orchestrate an evening,

12:26.093 --> 12:30.706
and...

12:30.793 --> 12:35.885
Can you see it? It was like
the feeling I had every day.

12:35.972 --> 12:36.451
I could believe everything
was wonderful and I was happy,

12:36.538 --> 12:38.322
and I was in love.

12:40.324 --> 12:44.067
And then as
the evening approached...

12:44.154 --> 12:46.591
there it was.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.550
There was the whisper.
There was...

12:48.637 --> 12:51.727
his wishes
that needed to be met.

12:51.858 --> 12:56.210
The group sex--it was at least
five nights a week.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.778
They had a protocol.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.519
Everyone had their role
they played,

13:01.606 --> 13:02.912
but I wasn't in a romantic
relationship with this man.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.610
I was in a work relationship
with this man.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.831
And it isn't because I thought
I was above it all.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.790
It was because I knew
the parameters of my job

13:10.877 --> 13:13.009
that I knew was expected of me,

13:13.096 --> 13:17.492
and I knew
90% of it was business.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.755
Lisa, you were part
of the business side...

13:19.842 --> 13:22.105
- Yeah.
- ...of the Playboy brand.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.977
Can you tell me about
the really disturbing things

13:24.064 --> 13:26.153
that either happened to you

13:26.240 --> 13:28.372
or that you noticed happened
to somebody else?

13:28.459 --> 13:29.721
Yeah, there were a couple
of times

13:29.809 --> 13:31.811
that I put myself in a position.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.684
When we were in the game house,

13:35.771 --> 13:39.949
Hef would ask me,
"Why don't you stay tonight?"

13:40.036 --> 13:43.083
I just told Hef that I--
I just couldn't do that.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.389
My daddy told me you don't
where you eat.

13:45.476 --> 13:48.523
The buffer was
I wasn't a Playmate.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.178
I was with Mary,
and I had a job,

13:51.308 --> 13:54.311
and that was the easy way
for me.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.879
But one night, I was working,

13:57.010 --> 13:58.707
and Hef was still out
in the game house.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.883
I had a date that night.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.972
I wanted to go home,
but we couldn't go home

14:03.059 --> 14:04.408
until Hef went upstairs
for the evening.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.628
So while he was still
in the game house,

14:06.715 --> 14:09.500
I quickly ran upstairs
to the master bedroom,

14:09.587 --> 14:12.634
and there were other women there
that were showering

14:12.721 --> 14:14.941
and dressing, and I think
you were in the tub,

14:15.028 --> 14:17.073
and I sat on the edge
of the tub

14:17.204 --> 14:19.684
and hiked up my skirt
and shaved my legs.

14:19.771 --> 14:24.776
And unexpectedly, Hef came up
much sooner than I thought,

14:24.864 --> 14:28.084
and he came up behind me and...

14:28.171 --> 14:30.608
- Oh, my God.
- I'm trying not to picture it.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.784
And he sort of squeezed
my shoulders and said,

14:32.872 --> 14:35.091
"Oh, my God.
You're joining us tonight?

14:35.222 --> 14:36.832
- Oh.
- And I just instantly thought,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.921
"Oh, I put myself
in this position."

14:39.008 --> 14:43.056
That's where the decision
was made that

14:43.143 --> 14:46.015
I didn't wanna ever feel
like that again.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.018
I'm reading a lot
of these criticisms

14:49.105 --> 14:51.586
that say,
"Oh, I went to the Mansion.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.762
I never saw any
of that happening."

14:53.849 --> 14:57.200
The same people that--
that would tend to believe

14:57.287 --> 14:58.419
somebody in an office
or a different environment,

14:58.506 --> 15:01.030
but they're not believing
these women.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.164
- -WI don't think--
- I thinks? they're believing us,

15:04.251 --> 15:06.688
but they think we deserved it.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.908
Mm, that's really harsh, but...

15:12.476 --> 15:13.521
Why wouldBecause--rve that?
WhBecause Playboy's Playboy.at?

15:13.651 --> 15:15.958
It's sexual. It's not a convent.
What do you expect?

15:16.045 --> 15:18.265
I mean, I also am getting
backlash from this.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.484
"Why did she wait so long?
I stand by Hefner."

15:20.571 --> 15:22.834
And to come after <i>us,</i>
we didn't do the harm.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.401
It was done to us

15:24.488 --> 15:27.187
and excused the person
who did it.

15:27.274 --> 15:31.843
You have had two
very different experiences.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.064
Lisa, can you just sum up
why you decided to come forward

15:35.195 --> 15:38.720
and support Sondra
during this experience for her?

15:38.807 --> 15:41.462
- Because she is my friend.
- She asked me to.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.986
Every woman should have a Lisa
in their life.

15:44.073 --> 15:47.033
Everyone should <i>be</i> more
supportive of women

15:47.163 --> 15:47.990
and their story.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.606
Sondra, you were so brave

15:55.693 --> 15:59.001
to share so many of your
traumatic experiences with us,

15:59.088 --> 16:01.090
but I know that one of
the reasons you did that

16:01.177 --> 16:03.049
is in the hope
that other people

16:03.136 --> 16:05.007
would share their stories, too.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.575
And there's one other woman
that's joining us...

16:07.662 --> 16:08.663
...that has had

16:08.750 --> 16:10.360
some very similar experiences--

16:10.491 --> 16:12.797
Susie Krabacher.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.669
Hi.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.758
- You're--
- You're grown up now.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.674
- It doesn't seem real.
- No, no, no.

16:19.761 --> 16:22.242
I've only been visualizing
you guys just as you were.

16:22.329 --> 16:25.288
I know. You still scare me
to death, you're so pretty.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.811
Stop.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.597
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.860
- Hi.
- I'm so glad you're okay.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.470
I'm okay. I'm okay.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.776
I'm so glad you're okay
and strong.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.647
And I'm so glad you are, too.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.954
I was just talking
in the makeup room.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.957
I never could come up to you
and talk to you

16:42.088 --> 16:44.481
because you were so beautiful
and so intimidating

16:44.568 --> 16:46.222
and so perfect.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:46.309 --> 16:49.878
No! I just... I'm so amazed
that you pulled off

16:49.965 --> 16:52.489
being so strong
during all of that.

16:52.576 --> 16:55.710
None of us had any idea.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.017
Yeah. I was hiding it.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.105
If we had only talked,
can you imagine?

16:59.192 --> 17:00.932
Yeah. Yeah.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.934
- It's been many years...
- Yeah.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.458
...since the two of you
have seen each other in person.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.155
- How many years? 20 years?
- Well, we were girls.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.679
- Oh, it's longer than that.
- We were girls. We--

17:08.766 --> 17:10.420
- 35?
- 35 years, maybe.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.466
35 years. Yeah.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.033
Can you first tell me, Susie,
a little bit

17:14.163 --> 17:15.556
about what brought you
to Playboy

17:15.643 --> 17:19.386
and what--what your story was
back then.

17:19.473 --> 17:23.520
Well, I started Playboy
because I needed the money.

17:23.607 --> 17:27.394
I was making $3.25 an hour
at my job,

17:27.481 --> 17:31.180
and I was approached by
a photographer from "Playboy,"

17:31.267 --> 17:33.008
and you know, at first,
I said, "Yes, you know,

17:33.095 --> 17:35.489
this sounds great,"
but then when the offer came

17:35.619 --> 17:39.667
to actually go to the Mansion,
it became really real.

17:39.797 --> 17:43.105
I had this moment as I was
going through those gates,

17:43.192 --> 17:45.064
you know, I can run now.

17:47.370 --> 17:52.767
I did believe that
what I was doing was wrong,

17:52.854 --> 17:54.421
but I thought, you know,
God's gonna forgive me.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.163
I need this opportunity,
and I'll never be able

17:57.250 --> 17:58.990
to make this kind of money.

17:59.121 --> 18:02.472
I was Playmate of the Month
of May 1983.

18:02.559 --> 18:05.127
I was staying
at the Playboy Mansion.

18:05.214 --> 18:09.088
It was all very intimidating
and really new.

18:09.175 --> 18:12.439
I felt safe in my room,
and that's where I stayed.

18:12.526 --> 18:17.400
Hef--he was telling me,
"Susie, I've heard that

18:17.487 --> 18:19.750
you're nervous and that you've
been staying in your room,

18:19.837 --> 18:23.450
but I want you to know
it's safe here."

18:23.537 --> 18:25.887
And I'm thinking to myself,
you know, okay,

18:25.974 --> 18:30.326
I've never had a strong
father figure in my life,

18:30.457 --> 18:32.285
and I don't know if
you knew it, but I--

18:32.372 --> 18:34.678
my grandfather was a pedophile.
- I did not know that.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.245
And I was his victim
from 4 years old...

18:36.332 --> 18:39.205
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- ...to 8,

18:39.292 --> 18:43.339
And so I'm thinking, finally
I have a grandfather figure

18:43.426 --> 18:46.473
that's nice and safe.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.955
One day, I was talking to Hef,
and I said, "You know,

18:51.042 --> 18:53.871
- I just--
- I-I need to know about my future.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.831
Will I have to go home?
Or you know, what will I do?"

18:56.918 --> 19:00.008
I trusted him so much.

19:00.095 --> 19:03.664
He really made me feel like
he cared for me...

19:03.751 --> 19:06.101
- Mm-hmm.
- ...as, you know,

19:06.188 --> 19:07.537
as like a family member.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.496
You were special.
Yeah, you were special.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.455
So he gave me a pill.
I don't even remember

19:12.542 --> 19:15.719
ending my sentence,
and I woke up,

19:15.850 --> 19:17.982
and then, you know,
I'm coming out of it.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.376
I'm coming out
of what's actually happened.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.117
This is happening.
This is not a dream.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.816
This is happening. Am I--
Am I a rape victim again?

19:25.903 --> 19:27.949
Could this possibly
be happening?

19:28.079 --> 19:31.300
The next day, I said,
"I need to talk to Marilyn."

19:31.387 --> 19:34.869
So I went into her office,
and I just broke down.

19:34.999 --> 19:39.395
I was so ashamed
and felt so gross.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.311
All I could say is,
"He did it to me,"

19:42.398 --> 19:46.402
and then she said,
"Don't worry. It's okay,"

19:46.489 --> 19:50.885
and so I'm like, "Okay,
so it's okay. It's okay.

19:50.972 --> 19:54.105
It's okay. It's okay,"

19:54.236 --> 19:56.238
and then I went back
to the makeup room,

19:56.325 --> 19:59.720
and the entire time,
you're being told,

19:59.807 --> 20:01.722
"Well, you know, you could be
Playmate of the Year,

20:01.809 --> 20:05.204
and this is so important,
and the money--

20:05.334 --> 20:06.814
your life will be
changed forever."

20:06.901 --> 20:08.468
Ever, yeah.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.470
"You'll never have to worry
about money again."

20:10.557 --> 20:13.560
And you're, like, what?
What's gonna happen after this?

20:13.647 --> 20:15.649
If I'm not Playmate of the Year,
I can't go back home.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.042
I mean, at least I couldn't.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.827
I think a lot of girls did
have their family's support,

20:19.914 --> 20:25.136
but I had nowhere else to go.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.877
He was always nice
in front of other people.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.879
Yes, yes.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.838
I didn't like going
to the parties.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.275
Boy, did I get in trouble
for that. That lasted--

20:33.406 --> 20:35.190
Oh, yeah, if you didn't
socialize, ooh.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.453
Yeah. It's like, "Oh, well,
just go to the party.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.543
Have your meal."
That's not what it was.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.241
Socialize is flirting,
older guys.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.025
Older men.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.809
Not anywhere near our age range.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.942
And they said
inappropriate things also.

20:48.029 --> 20:51.075
- They said inappropriate things.
- Touched you.

20:51.162 --> 20:54.296
Like, uh,
"How would you like a 36DD?"

20:54.383 --> 20:57.299
He wants to buy me
breast augmentation.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.867
- I just met the man.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.999
This is unbelievable because
what you're describing

21:02.086 --> 21:05.438
is, uh, kind of a circle
of people

21:05.525 --> 21:07.178
that expected you
to be sexually available...

21:07.266 --> 21:09.659
- Uh-huh.
- ...for these men.

21:09.746 --> 21:12.183
- Is that fair to say?
- Day and night.

21:12.314 --> 21:16.623
So there was
this uncomfortable experience

21:16.710 --> 21:19.103
that a lot of women
were traumatized by,

21:19.190 --> 21:21.062
and yet if you talk about it
to each other,

21:21.149 --> 21:22.803
then it makes it real.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.718
It's a problem,
and it becomes a problem, see?

21:24.805 --> 21:25.588
- It becomes a problem.
- Yeah.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.069
Okay. What did you do instead?

21:28.156 --> 21:30.289
We talked about everything else.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.250
You never really talked
about what happened in there.

21:35.381 --> 21:38.253
Susie, you wrote about
your experience 25 years later

21:38.340 --> 21:40.386
in your memoir.

21:40.516 --> 21:41.996
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.128
This is important.

21:44.215 --> 21:48.785
Sondra, you heard
that Susie wrote a book.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.309
It helped me...

21:50.396 --> 21:51.527
- Really?
- ...come to terms

21:51.614 --> 21:53.355
with what I had, yeah.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.443
And you hadn't talked
before then.

21:54.530 --> 21:57.228
Yeah. Yeah.-So you had no idea...

21:57.316 --> 21:58.404
- None.
- ...Susie, that you were

21:58.491 --> 21:59.796
the catalyst...
- No!

21:59.883 --> 22:01.407
...for Sondra deciding
to come forward.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.322
- No, and...
- My God.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.671
It was one of the--
one of the things

22:04.758 --> 22:06.586
that just triggered me,

22:06.673 --> 22:10.067
- and, uh, I just--
- I didn't want the girls to think

22:10.154 --> 22:12.069
that I was condoning
these things.

22:12.156 --> 22:16.335
Um...it's still a phenomenon
to me that

22:16.422 --> 22:18.815
the very girls that we know
were involved

22:18.902 --> 22:23.429
in this kind of activity
will not, um,

22:23.516 --> 22:25.474
hold him accountable for it.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.608
But the thing is, it was not
that we got ourself

22:28.695 --> 22:30.261
completely into it.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.611
We thought
we were doing something

22:31.698 --> 22:35.266
that would better our lives.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.834
I felt like this was--
this was it for me.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.880
I have such a huge amount
of empathy

22:39.967 --> 22:41.490
because it could have been me.
- I went to--
- I went to--

22:41.577 --> 22:43.187
Could've been anybody.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.015
I went to the Mansion
when I was 20.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.717
One of the amazing parts
of doing this special

22:50.804 --> 22:53.197
is hearing the feedback
from people

22:53.328 --> 22:54.982
that have seen Sondra's story,

22:55.112 --> 22:57.288
and, Audrey, you're somebody
that came forward

22:57.376 --> 22:58.594
with your own story.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.117
So can you tell me
a little bit about

23:00.248 --> 23:01.684
what brought you to Playboy
to begin with?

23:01.771 --> 23:05.035
Well, when I was younger,
I wanted to model.

23:05.122 --> 23:09.126
So everyone told me
I was not tall enough.

23:09.257 --> 23:10.998
So I thought, hmm,
well, maybe "Playboy."

23:11.085 --> 23:14.436
And I sent my pictures in
when I turned 18,

23:14.523 --> 23:17.483
and they sent me a letter
accepting me,

23:17.570 --> 23:19.528
and I was thrilled.

23:19.615 --> 23:23.793
I flew out to the Mansion,
got to stay in the guest house

23:23.880 --> 23:26.056
and meet Hef.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.929
So you were a teenager.
Did it feel safe to be with him?

23:29.016 --> 23:31.148
- Yeah, very.
- You felt safe?

23:31.279 --> 23:33.194
Yeah. He was married,
number one.

23:33.281 --> 23:36.110
He was married to Kimberley
at the time,

23:36.240 --> 23:39.200
and I read it in an article.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.507
He had plenty of women,
but through his marriages,

23:41.594 --> 23:43.683
he was always faithful.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.076
I do.

23:46.163 --> 23:49.950
As you reached into the '90s,
it was a big, big change.

23:50.037 --> 23:53.083
Kimberley was the lady
of the house,

23:53.170 --> 23:54.998
and the partying kinda ended.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.173
Kimberley's presence
was definitely known

23:56.260 --> 23:58.001
around the Mansion.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.526
Hef did not hit
on any of the Playmates.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.790
As far as talking to him,

24:03.877 --> 24:05.922
we were told that's a good way
to get yourself blacklisted

24:06.009 --> 24:08.359
from the Mansion.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.883
You know, if he--if we saw him
coming one way,

24:10.013 --> 24:11.711
we'd go the other way.

24:11.798 --> 24:16.150
So it's 1994. You came out
to shoot for "Playboy."

24:16.280 --> 24:17.804
- Mm-hmm.
- What you thought would be

24:17.891 --> 24:19.762
potentially a centerfold.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.938
- Yes.
- And then what happened?

24:22.025 --> 24:26.595
We did shoot for a day or two,

24:26.726 --> 24:29.468
and Kimberley wasn't there.
She was skiing.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.295
- Hef, though, was there.
- Yeah.

24:31.382 --> 24:32.949
- Okay.
- I spoke with him.

24:33.036 --> 24:36.387
Um, that's when he invited me
to his room.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.651
He said,
"I have some photos of you

24:38.781 --> 24:41.654
you might wanna take a look at."

24:41.784 --> 24:42.829
Everybody left,
and I was sitting

24:42.916 --> 24:44.570
at the bottom of the stairs

24:44.657 --> 24:47.442
deciding whether or not
if I should go upstairs.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.271
But then I'm thinking,

24:50.401 --> 24:52.491
you only live once.
This is my opportunity.

24:52.578 --> 24:55.885
This is my chance
to make connections

24:56.016 --> 24:59.846
and get out there
and go in my career and...

24:59.976 --> 25:06.156
I had no thoughts in my mind
that anything would happen.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.810
So you decided to go upstairs.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.986
What happened?

25:10.073 --> 25:13.250
He showed me the pictures of me.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.688
They were right there
by the door,

25:15.775 --> 25:18.342
and then immediately,
he walked me over to the bed,

25:18.429 --> 25:21.215
and I sat down.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.434
He was to the right of me,

25:23.565 --> 25:26.220
and he pulled out a joint
to split it,

25:26.350 --> 25:30.006
and now I'm starting
to get speechless.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.443
I'm not talking. I'm like, what?
This is all happening so fast.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.706
- Yeah.
- -What's--
- And he gave it to me,

25:33.793 --> 25:36.012
and then he's pulling down
his pants,

25:36.099 --> 25:39.929
- and I-I just started--
- I froze.

25:40.016 --> 25:44.281
And...he got on top of me.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.848
I'm sorry.

25:45.935 --> 25:49.983
And, um, I just froze.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.768
Did he have sex with you
without your consent?

25:52.855 --> 25:54.553
Yes, he did.
I didn't say anything.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.032
I didn't give him permission.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.208
What was I gonna do?

25:58.295 --> 25:59.949
If I said no, would he
have stopped? I don't know.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.604
- I just--
- But no. He wouldn't have.

26:02.735 --> 26:05.564
I laid there,
and when he was done,

26:05.651 --> 26:09.655
he walked me down
to the guest house.

26:09.742 --> 26:10.917
I didn't know what to think
that night.

26:11.047 --> 26:13.441
- I just--
- I cried myself to sleep.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.356
So, you know,
this isn't a fairy tale.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.184
This isn't what I signed up for.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.708
What are you feeling right now,
Sondra?

26:19.839 --> 26:22.058
Lots of girls have ambitions.
Many have ambitions.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.321
If that's what she was thinking,

26:24.408 --> 26:26.933
it didn't give him the right
to do what he did.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.718
The next day, I had a shoot,

26:29.805 --> 26:31.372
and I couldn't move.
I didn't get out of the bed.

26:31.459 --> 26:34.505
And I-I didn't go,
and the makeup artist, Missy,

26:34.593 --> 26:36.856
came at the time
and to check on me,

26:36.943 --> 26:39.293
and I said, "I just don't--
I just don't feel

26:39.380 --> 26:41.774
I wanna do this right now,"

26:41.861 --> 26:44.080
And they said, "Okay,"
and then they flew me home.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.474
Did you tell anybody that
this had just happened to you?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.389
No.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.478
I-I didn't know what to think.
I was scared.

26:50.565 --> 26:51.914
I thought I was gonna get
in trouble.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.960
- Yeah.
- His house, his power,

26:55.614 --> 26:56.702
She should've known better,
his enterprright?d be quiet--

26:56.789 --> 27:00.183
Right. So I had to just
shut my mouth and go home,

27:00.270 --> 27:03.099
and I did, and then I got
a letter in the mail--

27:03.186 --> 27:04.971
a termination letter.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.804
There was a moment,
wasn't there,

27:11.891 --> 27:14.328
where Kimberley,
his wife at the time,

27:14.415 --> 27:16.852
reached out to you?
- She did.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.419
What happened?

27:18.506 --> 27:20.813
She called my house phone,
and she's like,

27:20.943 --> 27:25.382
"Um, I heard that you were up
in the room with Hugh,"

27:25.513 --> 27:27.428
and she asked me
if I went up there willingly

27:27.558 --> 27:30.649
or did he invite me?

27:30.736 --> 27:33.390
Yeah, of course he invited me,
but I didn't tell her that.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.479
I didn't wanna get him
in trouble.

27:35.566 --> 27:36.524
- I didn't wanna get him--
- You didn't wanna get the man

27:36.655 --> 27:38.569
that raped you in trouble?
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.311
I mean, that is so crazy.

27:41.398 --> 27:44.401
He didn't care about me or...

27:44.488 --> 27:46.186
what happened to me,

27:46.273 --> 27:48.188
and I was protecting him.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.407
After this happened to you,

27:50.494 --> 27:52.714
did you ever see Hugh Hefner
again?

27:52.801 --> 27:55.935
No. That was it.
I was thrown away,

27:56.022 --> 27:58.285
and I shut my mouth.

27:58.372 --> 28:02.637
Can you describe
how that experience back then

28:02.768 --> 28:06.032
changed your life
and your image of yourself?

28:06.162 --> 28:08.077
It does change you,
especially the way

28:08.208 --> 28:11.820
you allow men to treat you sexually.

28:11.907 --> 28:15.694
And it took me a long time
to figure it all out.

28:15.824 --> 28:19.262
Never let a man
ever disrespected me.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.874
He altered your destiny
for your life.

28:21.961 --> 28:24.703
He altered it,
and not in a good way.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.404
Audrey, can you tell me
what it was like for you

28:30.491 --> 28:32.667
to try to track down Sondra?

28:32.754 --> 28:36.453
It was just divine intervention.

28:36.584 --> 28:39.108
A friend of mine said,

28:39.195 --> 28:41.632
"Audrey, they're doing something
about Playboy,"

28:41.763 --> 28:43.939
and then I saw her,
and I was like, oh, my God.

28:44.070 --> 28:47.247
This could be the chance
that I get to...

28:47.334 --> 28:49.162
- Yes.
- ...to tell what he did to me.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.555
- Yeah.
- I just said,

28:51.686 --> 28:53.514
"I have to talk to her. I have
to tell her what happened.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.516
She needs to hear this."

28:55.603 --> 28:58.693
Sondra, what did it feel like
the moment

28:58.780 --> 29:01.174
that you got that phone message?

29:01.261 --> 29:03.872
It was a voicemail I got,
and listening to it,

29:04.003 --> 29:05.961
I was stunned. It was like

29:06.048 --> 29:06.919
the air had been sucked
out of me,

29:07.006 --> 29:08.268
and--and I was shaking.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.226
I called her immediately,

29:10.357 --> 29:13.403
and she just started talking,
and she told me the story,

29:13.490 --> 29:15.754
and... and I told her
it wasn't her fault,

29:15.841 --> 29:19.583
and she started crying,
and then I started crying.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.672
- It--
- It touched me so deeply.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.110
The whole reason why
I came forward

29:24.240 --> 29:25.894
was being brought to me
and showing me

29:26.025 --> 29:28.114
that I was doing
the right thing.

29:28.244 --> 29:31.900
You just believed me instantly,
and that just felt so rewarding.

29:31.987 --> 29:35.295
Deep, deep, deep in my soul,
I was just...

29:35.382 --> 29:37.645
Sondra, you start the show.

29:37.732 --> 29:40.039
One of the very first things
you say

29:40.126 --> 29:42.432
in the very first episode while
you're getting miked up is...

29:42.519 --> 29:44.130
I'm not doing this
for 15 minutes of fame.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.784
I mean, who would wanna
throw themselves

29:45.871 --> 29:47.829
under the train for that?

29:47.916 --> 29:50.614
And you're kind of making fun
of it 'cause you're not here...

29:50.701 --> 29:52.660
- No.
- ...for publicity.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.357
- No.
- You're not here for publicity.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.055
No, freedom.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.317
- Freedom.
- Freedom.

29:57.404 --> 29:58.274
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

29:58.405 --> 29:59.798
Freedom from keeping

29:59.928 --> 30:02.583
such a dirty secret inside
for so long.

30:02.713 --> 30:05.804
Freedom for everyone out there
who is having to...

30:05.891 --> 30:07.283
- Yeah.
- ...to just stop and speak up

30:07.370 --> 30:09.764
and say no and--and...

30:09.851 --> 30:12.158
And say, "You're not getting
away with this."

30:12.245 --> 30:14.203
Whether you're dead or not,

30:14.290 --> 30:16.205
you're not getting away
with this.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.859
You were part of a sisterhood,
as you called it,

30:17.990 --> 30:20.862
with the other Playmates.
- Yeah.

30:20.949 --> 30:24.387
Do you think it's possible that
you're now starting a movement

30:24.474 --> 30:26.650
with a new sisterhood?
- Well, I hope so.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.262
Women coming together for women
and holding each other up,

30:29.349 --> 30:32.178
whether it's the good times
or the bad times.

30:32.308 --> 30:35.181
I can't even imagine
how strong you are

30:35.268 --> 30:37.923
and how brave you are and...

30:38.053 --> 30:40.229
- See?
- I endured one night of it.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.536
- You endured years of it.
- Yeah.

30:42.666 --> 30:45.278
I-I can't even imagine
what that

30:45.365 --> 30:47.933
would do to you mentally
and--and spiritually.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.457
Yeah. Thank you.

30:50.587 --> 30:54.200
I wish I had the courage to say
something a long time ago.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.202
You have the courage today.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.725
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I do. I do.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.863
Here we are, left with these
stories from these women,

31:04.993 --> 31:06.734
and what do we do with it now?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.823
And we wanted to bring
somebody onboard

31:08.910 --> 31:12.261
that can give us some insight,
and that's Dr. Kate Balestrieri,

31:12.348 --> 31:15.308
and I wanna ask you first,
Dr. Kate,

31:15.395 --> 31:17.397
there's a real...confusion
for a lot of us

31:17.484 --> 31:19.355
that were part
of the Playboy family

31:19.442 --> 31:23.490
because we feel on one hand
that we're proud

31:23.577 --> 31:25.231
of being able to powerful
in our femininity...

31:25.318 --> 31:27.189
- Yeah.
- ...and our sexuality

31:27.276 --> 31:28.669
and take control of that.
- Yeah.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.497
But the other part,
especially after watching

31:30.584 --> 31:34.544
what has transpired
over the last 10 weeks--

31:34.631 --> 31:37.330
there's a part of me that feels
really awful about it.

31:37.417 --> 31:41.029
In reality, human beings
are incredibly messy,

31:41.116 --> 31:43.249
and we're complicated
and we're dimensional,

31:43.379 --> 31:46.643
so there's room for there to be
really positive aspects

31:46.730 --> 31:49.472
of anyone's experience there,
as well as really

31:49.559 --> 31:52.562
terrifying and really horrifying
experiences and elements of it,

31:52.649 --> 31:55.696
because if they were all bad,
people would have left.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.915
- Yeah.
- Right?

31:58.829 --> 32:01.441
sit there and take that
- over and over and over againt

32:01.528 --> 32:03.878
if there weren't
some positive aspects

32:03.965 --> 32:05.488
to being a part of this world.

32:05.619 --> 32:08.317
You know, it's easy for people
to judge

32:08.404 --> 32:09.492
when you're not
in that situation.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.407
Yeah.

32:11.494 --> 32:16.151
I wanna understand why people
would hear these stories

32:16.238 --> 32:17.936
and either not believe
the stories,

32:18.023 --> 32:22.679
or believe the stories and
still choose to be critical.

32:22.810 --> 32:25.595
Let's get to a tweet
from Cooper Hefner.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.206
And for those that don't know,

32:27.293 --> 32:30.209
Cooper Hefner is Hugh Hefner's
son with Kimberley.

32:30.339 --> 32:35.344
So, um, here's what he had
to say on Twitter.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.738
"Some may not approve
of the life my dad chose,

32:37.825 --> 32:39.783
but my father was not a liar.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.134
However unconventional,

32:42.221 --> 32:45.006
he was sincere in his approach
and lived honestly.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.617
He was generous in nature
and cared deeply for people.

32:47.704 --> 32:49.402
These salacious stories

32:49.489 --> 32:54.711
are a case study
of regret becoming revenge."

32:54.842 --> 32:58.672
I... He was not in bed
with us.

32:58.759 --> 33:00.674
He has no idea
what he's talking about.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.719
He wasn't there.

33:02.850 --> 33:08.464
What happened to me was not,
um, generous, kind.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.771
- No.
- It was nothing but evil.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.816
Yeah.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.731
Here's one of my favorites,

33:14.818 --> 33:16.342
and I've seen this a bunch online.

33:16.429 --> 33:17.691
"Hef never did anything bad
to me."

33:17.821 --> 33:19.345
Yeah.

33:19.475 --> 33:23.653
And to me, that is
a strange argument.

33:23.740 --> 33:27.396
Just because somebody never
did anything bad to you,

33:27.483 --> 33:30.182
doesn't mean he didn't do
something bad to her.

33:30.269 --> 33:33.489
- He targeted vulnerable women.
- Mm-hmm.

33:33.576 --> 33:37.058
It was almost like he found
a niche in your armor somehow

33:37.145 --> 33:38.625
to put upon you.
- Yeah, well, yeah,

33:38.712 --> 33:41.323
we were easy to control,
easy to manipulate.

33:41.410 --> 33:44.674
There's a document referred
to now as "the Manifesto"--

33:44.761 --> 33:48.287
the Hefner Manifesto--
that is referred to

33:48.374 --> 33:52.595
by a lot of side commentators
about this show.

33:52.682 --> 33:57.948
"The girl next door should smell
like soap and be like a bunny."

33:58.036 --> 34:01.039
"When you feel like
caressing it, playing with it,

34:01.126 --> 34:03.258
the girl resembles a bunny."

34:03.389 --> 34:06.174
"The sex that we fight for
is innocent sex.

34:06.305 --> 34:08.437
Anybody can join."

34:08.524 --> 34:09.612
"Consider the girl
we made popular--

34:09.699 --> 34:11.049
the Playmate of the Month.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.789
She is never sophisticated,

34:12.876 --> 34:15.749
the girl you cannot
really have."

34:15.879 --> 34:19.970
"She is
a young, healthy, simple girl.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.843
The girl next door."

34:22.930 --> 34:24.279
"We are not interested

34:24.366 --> 34:26.325
in the mysterious,
difficult woman."

34:26.412 --> 34:29.023
"The Playboy girl has no lace,
no underwear.

34:29.110 --> 34:34.898
She's naked, well washed
with soap and water...

34:34.985 --> 34:38.772
and she's happy."

34:38.859 --> 34:41.296
And it's why he chose
certain girls.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.038
If you're too difficult
and too much trouble...

34:44.125 --> 34:45.822
- You're out of there.
- ...you're out of there.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.868
Why do you think that was,
Dr. Kate?

34:47.955 --> 34:50.392
Majority of predators, again,
are not going to go into their--

34:50.479 --> 34:53.830
their party and start being
abusive in front of people,

34:53.917 --> 34:56.659
because they need
to maintain this image

34:56.746 --> 35:01.186
of being the trustworthy, safe,
smart, kind, empowering host.

35:01.273 --> 35:02.361
The women who have come forward
with these stories

35:02.491 --> 35:05.233
were very, very young,

35:05.320 --> 35:07.105
and there's a naivete
that comes with that

35:07.192 --> 35:09.716
no matter how old a soul
you might be.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.327
Predators--they don't come
with a bulletin board that says,

35:12.458 --> 35:14.024
"Here's how I'm gonna hurt you."
- Yeah.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.071
They go out of their way
to convince you

35:17.158 --> 35:19.900
that they are safe and that
there's a special bond here.

35:20.030 --> 35:21.858
Here's another one.

35:21.945 --> 35:26.080
Why didn't these women
report these abuses earlier?

35:26.211 --> 35:31.129
I didn't want people to look
at me and think, "You did what?"

35:31.259 --> 35:33.131
I didn't want--
I didn't want them to look at me

35:33.218 --> 35:34.871
and think that I was dirty.

35:35.002 --> 35:37.396
They fear they're
not going to be believed,

35:37.483 --> 35:39.920
which was the case
for many of the women

35:40.007 --> 35:41.748
who have talked about it now,

35:41.835 --> 35:43.663
and they do feel like
they were at fault

35:43.793 --> 35:45.447
or somehow brought it upon themselves,

35:45.534 --> 35:47.710
which is absolutely not true,

35:47.797 --> 35:50.148
but that's how many predators
make them feel.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.716
One of the interesting things
as we've seen the journey

35:53.803 --> 35:55.588
of so many of these women
who have come forward,

35:55.675 --> 35:57.416
women have experienced
these buried memories.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.244
Mm-hmm.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.246
Repression is our number one
defense mechanism,

36:01.333 --> 36:02.899
so when things are scary,

36:03.030 --> 36:06.816
our mind works overtime
to keep them out of view,

36:06.903 --> 36:08.905
and as we see different things

36:09.036 --> 36:10.820
that remind us
of that experience,

36:10.907 --> 36:12.474
sometime those memories

36:12.561 --> 36:15.390
can come flooding back
really intrusively,

36:15.477 --> 36:17.392
um, and they can be overwhelming.

36:17.523 --> 36:20.743
In my case, this bothers me
to this day.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.181
Occasionally, I would get
a letter from a woman.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.400
I don't know if you ever got
the wives writing you letters,

36:25.487 --> 36:28.273
saying things like, "You know,
my husband just thinks

36:28.360 --> 36:31.145
you're the most beautiful woman
in the world,

36:31.232 --> 36:33.669
and you know, could you give me
any kind of tips?

36:33.756 --> 36:36.063
Because, you know,
I wanna look like you."

36:36.194 --> 36:38.631
I'm like, "Okay,
you wanna look like me?

36:38.718 --> 36:42.374
Then hire a lighting specialist,
get, um, someone

36:42.461 --> 36:44.680
that can spend three hours
on makeup,

36:44.811 --> 36:48.380
spend $10,000 on a photographer.
You'll look just like me."

36:50.077 --> 36:53.167
You never saw yourself look
of so pretty.ion.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.778
It wasn't like people snapped
six pictures,

36:55.909 --> 36:57.345
and those six pictures ended up
in the magazines.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.739
- No.
- No.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.262
I remember adding up
the rolls of film,

37:01.349 --> 37:04.831
and I came up
with 3,000 pictures

37:04.918 --> 37:07.399
for my centerfold.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.227
Of all of those images
that you shot,

37:09.314 --> 37:11.751
where did the rest
of those images go

37:11.838 --> 37:13.187
that didn't go in "Playboy"?

37:13.318 --> 37:15.494
- Who knows? I--
- I know.

37:15.581 --> 37:16.495
Do you?

37:16.625 --> 37:19.237
- You don't know?
- No.

37:19.367 --> 37:21.500
They're on dirty porn sites.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.943
<i>After significant</i> <i>
financial losses,</i>

37:30.030 --> 37:32.946
<i>in 2011, Playboy Enterprises</i> <i>
sold Playboy assets</i>

37:33.033 --> 37:35.514
<i>to a company called MindGeek,</i>

37:35.601 --> 37:39.039
<i>and since then,</i> <i>
a lot of former Playmates</i>

37:39.126 --> 37:43.957
<i>have seen their explicit images</i> <i>
on porn sites--</i>

37:44.044 --> 37:48.788
<i>places that they never believed</i> <i>
their images would end up.</i>

37:48.875 --> 37:52.313
What you're telling me is that
you're not in control

37:52.400 --> 37:53.880
of those images.
- Oh, no, not at all,

37:54.010 --> 37:56.186
and--and no woman deserves
to be on a porn site

37:56.274 --> 37:58.058
unless she wants to be.

37:58.145 --> 37:59.973
I can see you're so upset, Susie.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.845
Well, this is
very new information.

38:02.976 --> 38:05.544
- I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
- I didn't.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.416
- This is news to me.
- Our images are used.

38:08.547 --> 38:12.986
We are used as carnival barkers
to lure people in.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.467
There are images, and our names
are on these sites,

38:15.597 --> 38:17.556
and it looks like
we're endorsing this.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.558
What?

38:19.645 --> 38:21.211
They've not only sold
our beautiful images.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.344
They sold our outtakes.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.215
What?!

38:25.303 --> 38:27.000
Why are the outtakes
so different

38:27.130 --> 38:29.785
than what ends up
in the magazine?

38:29.872 --> 38:32.484
Why would you be okay
with being nude in the magazine

38:32.614 --> 38:36.488
but not okay with these outtakes
being out there in the internet?

38:36.618 --> 38:38.751
- They're graphic.
- They're graphic.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.536
Uh, I was told that my pictures
were being revered as art.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.495
Yeah.

38:43.582 --> 38:46.062
This is your private,
most intimate part of yourself,

38:46.149 --> 38:48.282
and to have that
violated like that,

38:48.369 --> 38:52.199
our images being soiled
and our legacies...

38:52.330 --> 38:53.418
Did you have a lawyer with you, Susie,

38:53.505 --> 38:54.984
when you signed a contract?
- No!

38:55.071 --> 38:58.248
First of all, what 19-year-oldcan afford a lawyer?

38:58.379 --> 39:00.294
- Yeah.
- I was in the makeup chair,

39:00.425 --> 39:02.427
and I was handed something
saying, "Sign this."

39:02.514 --> 39:04.559
Yep. Yep.

39:04.646 --> 39:07.519
- I didn't--
- I didn't even have the--the time to read it.

39:07.606 --> 39:10.348
You had your clothes off.
You were about ready to go on.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.915
- You're--
- You're nervous, and they stuff it to you like...

39:13.002 --> 39:14.700
- Yep.
- ...like they're handing you

39:14.787 --> 39:16.919
a birthday card that everybody's
signing for the boss.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.530
And you signed it,
and it was gone,

39:18.617 --> 39:21.315
and you never saw it again.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.056
They may have had
the legal right to do this,

39:23.143 --> 39:25.101
but they don't--
morally, it is so wrong.

39:27.016 --> 39:30.585
His promise was to always
protect us and keep us

39:30.672 --> 39:34.546
within the framework
of Girl Next Door.

39:34.633 --> 39:39.507
He lied. The Playboy contract
gave Hefner and Playboy

39:39.638 --> 39:42.684
the right to use the photos
and the filming

39:42.771 --> 39:47.341
in any media that he saw fit.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.343
Much of what began
with the magazine

39:49.474 --> 39:51.258
has expanded now
to the internet.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.565
It's just a tremendous,
exciting time.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.784
My name is attached
to every porn site

39:55.915 --> 39:57.307
you can imagine.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.614
That's bull

39:59.745 --> 40:02.835
They just opened the floodgates
and let 'em go.

40:02.922 --> 40:06.882
<i>And Hef didn't respect</i> <i>
his girlfriends' photos either.</i>

40:06.969 --> 40:09.363
<i>Even Hefner's private party</i> <i>
photos have somehow leaked.</i>

40:09.494 --> 40:11.626
When you would go out with Hef,

40:11.713 --> 40:13.933
he's taking all kinds of
naked pictures of these women,

40:14.063 --> 40:16.414
when we're wasted
out of our minds,

40:16.501 --> 40:19.547
and he would print out, like,
eight copies

40:19.678 --> 40:21.244
for him and all the women.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.856
You would pass them around.
It's just gross.

40:23.943 --> 40:26.162
There was just this mountain
of revenge porn

40:26.249 --> 40:28.208
just waiting to come out.

40:28.295 --> 40:31.907
<i>After Holly's episode,</i> <i>
Hefner's widow Crystal wrote,</i>

40:31.994 --> 40:34.083
<i>"I found thousands of those</i> <i>
disposable camera photos</i>

40:34.214 --> 40:35.998
<i>you are talking about, Holly.</i>

40:36.085 --> 40:38.218
<i>I immediately ripped them up</i> <i>
and destroyed</i>

40:38.305 --> 40:41.047
<i>every single one of them</i> <i>
for you</i>

40:41.134 --> 40:42.918
<i>and the countless other women</i> <i>
in them.</i>

40:43.005 --> 40:44.311
<i>They're gone."</i>

40:44.442 --> 40:46.574
What do you want women
at home right now

40:46.705 --> 40:50.665
that are sharing
these experiences to do next?

40:50.752 --> 40:52.972
Well, first of all, I want them
to know it's not their fault.

40:53.102 --> 40:55.844
It's not their fault.
It's his.

40:55.975 --> 40:59.674
And, uh, I hope
that they come forward,

40:59.805 --> 41:01.067
because united,
we can make a difference.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.547
- That's right.
- We can make a difference.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.679
I mean, there's just a few of us
right now...

41:04.766 --> 41:05.811
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that are talking openly

41:05.898 --> 41:09.684
about really embarrassing stuff.-Yeah.

41:09.815 --> 41:12.295
Audrey said that she didn't want
to let Hugh Hefner

41:12.382 --> 41:13.819
get away with it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:13.949 --> 41:14.950
- That's why she's here.
- Uh-huh.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.997
- Oh, yeah,]
- Doethat's exactly right.ou?

41:18.127 --> 41:19.520
He cannot get away with this.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.827
You don't want
the next generation

41:21.914 --> 41:23.263
of young women to think that
that was okay and he was okay.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.004
Yeah, and so they'll fall
for the next guy...

41:25.091 --> 41:26.396
- Mm-hmm.
- ...who gives them these lines

41:26.484 --> 41:30.575
and you start saying,
"No, this isn't right."

41:30.662 --> 41:35.580
that's watching this and--
and give a final message?

41:35.667 --> 41:38.278
It's time for them to stand up
for their daughters

41:38.365 --> 41:40.715
so that it won't happen to them.

41:40.802 --> 41:43.631
They need to, uh,
take their power back,

41:43.718 --> 41:47.679
I think in order to become fully
who they were supposed to be.

41:47.809 --> 41:51.160
We really need to stop
idolizing a man

41:51.247 --> 41:55.295
who I can tell you was a rapist.

41:55.382 --> 41:56.644
I don't need it to sign
any legal documents.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.690
That's my testimony.

41:58.777 --> 42:01.562
We're not the bad guys here.

42:01.649 --> 42:03.433
We didn't do these awful things.
He did.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.524
We're not rewriting history.
We're just writing it.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.395
- Yeah.
- And we're never been allowed

42:08.482 --> 42:10.440
to tell our story,
and it's our time.

42:12.138 --> 42:14.053
We are strong.
