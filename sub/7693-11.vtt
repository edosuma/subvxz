WEBVTT

00:08.039 --> 00:10.211
HEY, GUYS,
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.383
I PICKED THIS UP
AT AUCTION TODAY,

00:12.383 --> 00:15.586
AND IT ONLY COST ME
A MILLION DOLLARS.

00:15.586 --> 00:18.249
FOR A SHEET?

00:18.249 --> 00:19.650
I GUESS I'D BETTER
START SAVING UP

00:19.650 --> 00:22.393
IF I'M GONNA BE
A GHOST FOR HALLOWEEN.

00:22.393 --> 00:25.696
IT'S A PAINTING, ADAM,
BY A VERY FAMOUS ARTIST

00:25.696 --> 00:29.330
NAMED VON SCHTOPP.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.661
HM. I WISH I WOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE

00:30.661 --> 00:33.664
TO "VON SCHTOPP"
 YOU FROM BUYING IT.

00:35.206 --> 00:36.637
WHAT IS IT?

00:36.637 --> 00:39.640
IT'S ABSTRACT ART, ADAM.
IT'S WHATEVER YOU THINK IT IS.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.472
I THINK
IT'S A CRYING WOMAN.

00:41.472 --> 00:42.673
I THINK
IT'S A STORM AT SEA.

00:42.673 --> 00:45.316
I THINK SOMEONE JUST
BLEW A MILLION BUCKS.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.249
( musical ringtone plays )

00:48.249 --> 00:50.381
THAT'S ME.
DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES.

00:50.381 --> 00:52.683
HELLO? UH-HUH.

00:52.683 --> 00:55.386
OH, BOY. ALL RIGHT.

00:55.386 --> 00:57.688
LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT TO
PUT OUT A FIRE AT WORK.

00:57.688 --> 00:59.690
WHAT HAPPENED?
 BETTY FROM ACCOUNTING
GOT HER HEAD CAUGHT...

00:59.690 --> 01:02.193
IN THE POSITRON
COLLIDER AGAIN.

01:02.193 --> 01:03.464
OHH!

01:03.464 --> 01:04.595
THAT'S GONNA BE MESSY.

01:04.595 --> 01:07.268
CAN YOU GUYS PUT THAT
IN THE ART VAULT FOR ME?

01:07.268 --> 01:08.599
WAIT, YOU HAVE
AN ART VAULT?

01:08.599 --> 01:09.800
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA LEARN?

01:09.800 --> 01:13.604
I HAVE A EVERYTHING.
 ( chuckles )

01:13.604 --> 01:18.649
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT TOUCH THE DAVENPORTRAITS.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.551
WHAT'S A DAVENPORTRAIT?

01:33.093 --> 01:36.767
AM I SCREAMING OUT LOUD
OR JUST INSIDE MY HEAD?

01:36.767 --> 01:40.801
I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT:
DAVENPORT IS ONE WEIRD DUDE.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.734
AH. VOILA.

01:43.734 --> 01:46.307
THE VON SCHTO--

01:46.307 --> 01:48.709
EW, GROSS, GROSS, GROSS...!
 TURN AROUND!

01:48.709 --> 01:51.542
AH-CHOO!

01:51.542 --> 01:53.714
WHOA.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.646
ADAM, WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:55.646 --> 01:58.589
OH, I THINK THAT SNEEZE
ACCIDENTALLY TRIGGERED
MY HEAT VISION!

01:58.589 --> 02:01.622
BIG "D" IS GOING
TO FREAK OUT!

02:01.622 --> 02:04.695
LET'S NOT PANIC.
THIS HOLE IS BARELY
NOTICEABLE.

02:04.695 --> 02:06.257
AH-CHOO!

02:07.558 --> 02:10.731
THAT, HOWEVER,
IS INCREDIBLY NOTICEABLE!

02:10.731 --> 02:13.704
ADAM, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO DESTROY PAINTINGS,

02:13.704 --> 02:15.606
DO IT TO THOSE!

02:17.268 --> 02:20.311
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

02:20.311 --> 02:24.415
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:24.415 --> 02:26.747
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:26.747 --> 02:28.719
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:28.719 --> 02:29.720

03:10.190 --> 03:12.893
MR. DAVENPORT'S
MILLION-DOLLAR PAINTING!

03:12.893 --> 03:16.527
MR. DAVENPORT'S GONNA KILL US
WHEN HE SEES WHAT HAPPENED.

03:16.527 --> 03:18.329
OKAY, WELL,
MAYBE HE WON'T NOTICE

03:18.329 --> 03:20.831
IF WE FILL THE ROOM WITH THINGS
THAT LOOK MUCH MORE HIDEOUS.

03:20.831 --> 03:22.973
MORE HIDEOUS?

03:22.973 --> 03:25.906
HAVE YOU SEEN THE DAVEN LISA?

03:29.510 --> 03:31.211
( ding )

03:37.848 --> 03:40.621
HEY. BIG "D."
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK?

03:40.621 --> 03:42.293
UH, I FORGOT SOMETHING.

03:42.293 --> 03:44.525
I FORGOT THAT I LEFT
MY MILLION-DOLLAR PAINTING

03:44.525 --> 03:46.427
IN THE HANDS OF THE FOUR
MOST DESTRUCTIVE

03:46.427 --> 03:48.459
TEENAGERS IN THE WORLD!

03:49.630 --> 03:51.402
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S OKAY.

03:51.402 --> 03:52.763
IT'S FINE.
 LOOKS GREAT.

03:52.763 --> 03:54.965
IT'S FINE. GREAT.

03:54.965 --> 03:56.907
HEY, WAIT. HEY.

03:56.907 --> 03:59.770
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS ONE,
AND IT'S BORING.

03:59.770 --> 04:03.474
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT THIS

04:03.474 --> 04:05.446
BEAUTIFUL...

04:05.446 --> 04:07.878
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

04:07.878 --> 04:10.250
YEAH, I REMEMBER
POSING FOR THAT ONE.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.922
YOU KNOW IT TOOK US HOURS
TO GET THE FRUIT

04:11.922 --> 04:14.325
POSITIONED JUST RIGHT?

04:18.389 --> 04:21.432
WELL, YOU'VE JUST KILLED
APPLES FOR ME.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.264
I WAS GONNA BE
THE BIG BANANA,

04:24.264 --> 04:25.496
BUT I THOUGHT THAT'D BE
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

04:25.496 --> 04:27.298
( nonsensical sound )
DON'T DO THAT!

04:27.298 --> 04:28.439
WHY NOT?

04:28.439 --> 04:29.500
BECAUSE.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.574
B-BECAUSE I...
HAVE AN IDEA.

04:33.574 --> 04:39.310
YOU SHOULD POSE
FOR A DAVEN-SCULPTURE.

04:39.310 --> 04:42.383
DAVEN-SCULPTURE! YES!

04:42.383 --> 04:45.055
CHASE, YOUR BRILLIANCE
IS ONLY MATCHED BY
YOUR GOOD TASTE.

04:45.055 --> 04:47.057
I'M GONNA GET TO WORK
ON THAT RIGHT AWAY.

04:47.057 --> 04:51.362
OH! GET READY,
GUYS, FOR SIX FEET
OF STONE-COLD ME!

04:51.362 --> 04:52.693
SIX FEET?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.825
THERE'S A PEDESTAL!

04:58.068 --> 05:00.771
OKAY, MR. DAVENPORT'S GONNA
BE AT THE SCULPTOR'S STUDIO

05:00.771 --> 05:02.302
FOR A FEW MORE HOURS.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.075
THEY'RE ONLY
UP TO HIS KNEES.
 HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

05:05.075 --> 05:07.578
BECAUSE HE'S GIVING ME
A PHOTO PLAY-BY-PLAY.

05:07.578 --> 05:10.310
( all reacting )

05:10.310 --> 05:12.483
OKAY, THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOME WAY TO FIX THIS PAINTING.

05:12.483 --> 05:14.485
I KNOW.
WE CAN MAKE A REPLICA.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.086
I CAN PULL AN IMAGE
OF THE PAINTING

05:16.086 --> 05:17.818
FROM MY INTERNAL HARD DRIVE

05:17.818 --> 05:19.450
AND PROJECT IT
ONTO A BLANK CANVAS.

05:19.450 --> 05:21.352
THEN WE CAN TRACE IT
AND PAINT OVER IT.

05:21.352 --> 05:22.953
THAT'LL NEVER WORK.

05:22.953 --> 05:25.356
WE CAN'T PAINT THAT FAST.

05:25.356 --> 05:27.428
( clears throat loudly )

05:27.428 --> 05:30.361
HEY, DO YOU MIND?
WE'RE TRYING TO THINK OVER HERE.

05:30.361 --> 05:32.803
I CAN PAINT THAT FAST.

05:32.803 --> 05:34.064
GOOD FOR YOU.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.737
QUIT BRAGGING AND HELP US
COME UP WITH THE SOLUTION.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.611
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

05:51.382 --> 05:53.454
ALL RIGHT, BREE,
DO YOUR THING.

06:01.792 --> 06:03.464
DONE AND DONE.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.765
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.537
IT'S PERFECT.
 CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

06:06.537 --> 06:07.698
STILL UGLY.

06:07.698 --> 06:10.471
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.742
WE'LL GO HANG THE REPLICA.

06:11.742 --> 06:13.674
ADAM, YOU TAKE CARE
OF THE ORIGINAL.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.546
WHAT? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH IT?

06:15.546 --> 06:18.549
HIDE IT SOMEPLACE
THAT MR. DAVENPORT
WILL NEVER FIND IT.

06:18.549 --> 06:20.411
MAKE IT DISAPPEAR!

06:20.411 --> 06:21.912
OKAY, BUT I'M GONNA
NEED A MAGIC WAND

06:21.912 --> 06:24.114
AND A VOLUNTEER
FROM THE AUDIENCE.

06:24.114 --> 06:26.617
HOW 'BOUT YOU,
YOUNG LADY?

06:26.617 --> 06:28.789
JUST GO.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.892
AH. THERE.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.865
MR. DAVENPORT WILL NEVER
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

06:34.865 --> 06:37.127
OKAY, LET'S BE HONEST--
IF IT'S NOT A MIRROR
OR HIS BANK ACCOUNT,

06:37.127 --> 06:39.500
HE'S NOT REALLY
PAYING ATTENTION.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.734
HEY!

06:43.734 --> 06:46.507
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?

06:46.507 --> 06:50.010
WHAT ARE WE DOING
DOWN HERE? WELL...
( chuckling )

06:50.010 --> 06:52.543
WE'RE DOWN HERE
'CAUSE YOUR PAINTING

06:52.543 --> 06:54.885
REALLY SPOKE TO US.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.889
THAT'S RIGHT. AND...
IT SAID...

06:58.889 --> 07:02.523
UH, "I'M LONELY.
COME HANG OUT WITH ME."

07:03.854 --> 07:05.526
IT'S A LOT LIKE YOU
THAT WAY.

07:08.499 --> 07:09.660
HMM.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.507
DID YOU GUYS REALLY THINK
I WOULDN'T NOTICE?

07:16.507 --> 07:18.008
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:18.008 --> 07:19.970
( scoffs )
YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT

07:19.970 --> 07:21.211
UPSIDE DOWN!

07:23.443 --> 07:24.575
AH.

07:24.575 --> 07:27.147
( enthused reactions )

07:31.221 --> 07:32.923
THERE YOU ARE.

07:32.923 --> 07:35.786
IT WAS HIM!
 IT WAS HIM!
 IT WAS HIM!

07:35.786 --> 07:38.989
JUST TAKE THE HIT.
WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE
HIS FAVORITE.

07:38.989 --> 07:41.492
GOOD NEWS--
I SOLD THE PAINTING.

07:41.492 --> 07:42.833
WHAT? WHY?

07:42.833 --> 07:44.735
SOME WALL STREET GUY
E-MAILED ME AND SAID

07:44.735 --> 07:48.168
HE'D BUY IT FOR A MILLION
MORE THAN I PAID FOR IT.

07:49.239 --> 07:50.701
GUY CAME BY,
LOOKED IT OVER,

07:50.701 --> 07:52.673
AND HE WENT
STRAIGHT TO THE BANK.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.944
( doorbell rings )

07:53.944 --> 07:55.806
HEAR THAT?
THAT, MY FRIENDS,

07:55.806 --> 07:57.978
IS A SEVEN-FIGURE
DING DONG.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.610
♪ MONEY'S COMIN' ♪

07:59.610 --> 08:01.151
♪ MONEY'S COMIN' ♪

08:01.151 --> 08:03.884
♪ MONEY!
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY! ♪

08:03.884 --> 08:05.956
DONALD DAVENPORT?
 UH-HUH.

08:05.956 --> 08:07.688
I'M SPECIAL AGENT RYKER.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.690
WE GOT A CALL FROM
A PROSPECTIVE BUYER

08:09.690 --> 08:12.523
THAT YOU WERE ATTEMPTING
TO SELL FORGED ART.

08:12.523 --> 08:14.895
FORGED ART?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.266
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS.

08:16.266 --> 08:20.170
THE BUYER REPORTED THAT
THIS CANVAS STILL HAD
THE PRICE TAG ATTACHED,

08:20.170 --> 08:23.203
THAT IT WAS PURCHASED
AT THE ART DEPOT...

08:23.203 --> 08:24.635
ON SALE.

08:26.036 --> 08:28.238
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:28.238 --> 08:32.543
IT'S WHEN A STORE OFFERS
A PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT.

08:32.543 --> 08:34.544
MR. DAVENPORT, SELLING
FAKE ART IS A FELONY.

08:34.544 --> 08:37.847
YOU COULD BE FACING
20 YEARS IN PRISON.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.890
TWENTY YEARS?!

08:39.890 --> 08:42.793
WELL, AT LEAST YOU'LL BE OUT
IN TIME FOR ADAM'S GRADUATION.

08:43.994 --> 08:45.826
GUESS I'D BETTER
START STUDYING.

08:54.765 --> 08:57.067
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.669
THAT PAINTING IS AN ORIGINAL.

08:58.669 --> 09:01.541
IT'S GOT AN I.D. CHIP IMBEDDED
IN THE CANVAS. SCAN IT.

09:03.914 --> 09:05.115
( buzzing sound )

09:05.115 --> 09:08.178
THAT, SIR,
IS THE BAD BUZZ,
WHICH MEANS NO CHIP.

09:08.178 --> 09:11.882
BUT THERE IS A CHIP
IN PRISON, AND HE IS MEAN.

09:14.224 --> 09:15.886
WAIT.

09:15.886 --> 09:17.728
HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

09:17.728 --> 09:20.761
WE PAINTED THE FAKE.
 YOU WHAT?!

09:20.761 --> 09:22.733
WE ACCIDENTALLY RUINED
THE REAL PAINTING,

09:22.733 --> 09:25.235
SO WE FORGED A COPY
SO YOU WOULDN'T FIND OUT.

09:25.235 --> 09:26.737
YOU WHAT?!

09:26.737 --> 09:29.199
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO ACT IT OUT FOR HIM.

09:29.199 --> 09:32.673
CHASE, YOU BE THE PAINTING,
I'LL SNEEZE A HOLE IN YOU.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.846
LOOK, I'M SURE THIS IS ALL
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

09:35.846 --> 09:38.208
CHASE, GO GET THE ORIGINAL
AND SHOW IT TO THE NICE MAN

09:38.208 --> 09:40.250
WITH THE BIG BADGE
AND THE TINY LITTLE SCANNER.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.152
SURE.

09:42.152 --> 09:43.884
WAIT. ADAM, WHERE IS IT?

09:43.884 --> 09:46.887
OH, I THREW IT IN
THE DUMPSTER AT SCHOOL.
 WHAT?!

09:46.887 --> 09:48.889
YOU TOLD ME TO PUT IT
WHERE HE WOULDN'T LOOK.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.221
DID HE LOOK THERE? NO.
YOU'RE WELCOME!

09:51.221 --> 09:54.825
OKAY, MAYBE IT'S STILL THERE.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.727
IF WE GET IT BACK,
WILL YOU LET HIM GO?

09:56.727 --> 09:57.998
I SUPPOSE.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.730
IF YOU PRODUCE
THE ORIGINAL,

09:59.730 --> 10:01.702
THEN HIS STORY CHECKS OUT,
BUT UNTIL THEN,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.103
I'VE GOT A WARRANT
TO SEARCH THE PLACE.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.135
FOR WHAT?
 ANY FORGED ART.

10:05.135 --> 10:06.837
WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK
EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

10:06.837 --> 10:08.378
DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL BE CAREFUL.

10:16.186 --> 10:18.118
( objects crashing )

10:20.851 --> 10:22.192
RELAX, BIG "D."

10:22.192 --> 10:26.827
YOU DIDN'T REALLY
BREAK ANY LAWS...
THAT THEY KNOW OF.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.128
LOOK, HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

10:28.128 --> 10:30.230
WHEN THEY FIND THE LAB
AND HOW TO EXPLAIN IT?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.231
THAT WOULD BE BAD!

10:31.231 --> 10:33.664
HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THIS. I GOT IT.

10:33.664 --> 10:36.136
HEY! MR. AGENT.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.738
WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.170
BUT SAY WE DID--
HOW WOULD WE GO
ABOUT DOING THAT?

10:41.241 --> 10:44.074
LOOK, THE THREE OF YOU
GO FIND THAT PAINTING.

10:44.074 --> 10:47.647
LEO, YOU STAY HERE WITH ME
AND HELP ME DISTRACT
THESE AGENTS.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.052
SO...

10:52.052 --> 10:54.254
YOU'RE AN ART COP.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.827
HOPE YOU DON'T PLAN ON
"FRAMING" US.

10:58.228 --> 10:59.359
I'M SORRY.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.192
THIS IS MY FIRST
"BRUSH" WITH THE LAW.

11:02.192 --> 11:04.294
LEO, STOP IT.

11:04.294 --> 11:07.738
LET THESE MEN DO THEIR JOBS
AND "CANVAS" THE AREA.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.242
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
GET THE GERMAN SHEPHERD.

11:16.246 --> 11:20.010
UGH! STICKY!

11:20.010 --> 11:21.451
UGH! SQUISHY!

11:21.451 --> 11:23.153
AAH! IT'S MOVING!

11:24.815 --> 11:26.456
ADAM, WHERE IS THE PAINTING?

11:26.456 --> 11:27.818
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SHOULD BE IN HERE.

11:27.818 --> 11:28.989
I JUST THREW IT OUT
THIS MORNING.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.460
OKAY, THIS IS DISGUSTING.

11:30.460 --> 11:34.224
CAN'T DAVENPORT JUST GO
OFF TO JAIL FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

11:35.966 --> 11:37.267
HEY! SCHOOL'S OVER.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.900
GO HOME AND MAKE
YOUR PARENTS MISERABLE!

11:39.900 --> 11:43.133
PRINCIPAL PERRY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:43.133 --> 11:45.275
GETTING RID OF EXPIRED
CAFETERIA MEAT.

11:45.275 --> 11:47.137
IF YOU ASK ME,
IT'S STILL GOOD.

11:47.137 --> 11:49.279
MEAT'S ALWAYS EXPIRED--
IT'S DEAD!

11:49.279 --> 11:51.141
( disgusted gasps )

11:51.141 --> 11:53.283
I CAN'T BE HERE.
I DON'T WANNA BE HERE.

11:53.283 --> 11:55.045
GET ME OUT!

11:55.045 --> 11:56.446
OH, MAN UP, MARY.

11:56.446 --> 11:59.249
THE MAGGOTS DON'T SET IN
UNTIL THE NOON SUN HITS.

12:00.951 --> 12:04.995
( insect buzzes )

12:04.995 --> 12:06.296
SO... ( chuckles )

12:06.296 --> 12:09.329
YOU GUYS ARE DUMPSTER
DIVERS LIKE ME, HUH?

12:09.329 --> 12:13.203
NOPE, BUT THANKS FOR
THAT LITTLE GLIMPSE
INTO YOUR LIFE.

12:13.203 --> 12:16.336
YOU TWERPS ARE GONNA HAVE
TO DIVE ELSEWHERE.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.038
I'VE ALREADY HAULED OFF
ALL THE GOOD STUFF.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.339
FOUND THE PERFECT PAINTING

12:19.339 --> 12:22.813
TO USE AS THE LAST OBSTACLE
ON MY GOLF COURSE!

12:22.813 --> 12:25.275
PAINTING?
 PAINTING?
 GOLF COURSE?

12:32.152 --> 12:35.786
SO, THIS IS WHY YOU PICK
THROUGH THE TRASH?

12:35.786 --> 12:37.888
I KNOW THIS
MAY COME AS A SHOCK,

12:37.888 --> 12:41.461
BUT BEING A PRINCIPAL
ISN'T AS GLAMOROUS
AS I MAKE IT LOOK.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.233
SO...

12:43.233 --> 12:44.935
I'VE CREATED FOR MYSELF...

12:44.935 --> 12:47.767
( Scottish accent )
A FANCY LITTLE COUNTRY CLUB!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.900
WITH TRASH.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.072
THAT IS GLAMOROUS.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.475
YOU JUST LOST YOURSELF
A CADDY JOB, TINY WOODS.

12:57.307 --> 12:59.149
SO, THE TEE IS RIGHT THERE.

12:59.149 --> 13:01.081
I SHOOT THROUGH THE LIFE SAVER,

13:01.081 --> 13:02.853
OVER TO THE SPEAKERS,
OFF THE BONGOS,

13:02.853 --> 13:04.214
THEN THE TENNIS RACKET,

13:04.214 --> 13:06.887
OVER TO THE VACUUM,
UP TO THE FAN,

13:06.887 --> 13:09.119
OVER TO THE UMBRELLA,
INTO THE RAIN GUTTER,

13:09.119 --> 13:11.191
UP THE TREADMILL, THROUGH
THE HOLE IN THE PAINTING,

13:11.191 --> 13:13.363
INTO THE HELMET.

13:14.564 --> 13:17.267
BACK IN MY GLORY DAYS,
I WAS ON THE PRO CIRCUIT.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.900
GOTTA KEEP MY SKILLS SHARP.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.472
OHH!
 OHH!

13:24.804 --> 13:26.206
GUYS, GETTING
THIS PAINTING BACK

13:26.206 --> 13:28.808
IS GONNA BE A LOT MORE
DIFFICULT THAN I THOUGHT.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.341
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GRAB IT AND RUN?

13:31.341 --> 13:33.283
THE WOMAN IS HOLDING
A METAL CLUB,

13:33.283 --> 13:36.246
AND I DON'T THINK
SHE'S AFRAID TO USE IT.

13:36.246 --> 13:38.418
( clears throat )

13:38.418 --> 13:40.590
HEADS UP.
I'M MORE POWER
THAN ACCURACY,

13:40.590 --> 13:44.054
SO COVER ANYTHING YOU DON'T
WANT A GOLF BALL TO SMASH.

13:48.398 --> 13:50.360
Principal Perry:
WHOO!

13:54.464 --> 13:56.136
AAHH!

13:56.136 --> 13:59.169
UGH! CHIMP PICKLES!

13:59.169 --> 14:03.073
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
MAKE THIS COURSE A LOT EASIER?

14:03.073 --> 14:04.474
REMOVING THIS PAINTING.

14:04.474 --> 14:07.117
GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY JUNK!

14:08.478 --> 14:11.922
I WADED THROUGH BIOHAZARD WASTE
TO GET TO THAT.

14:11.922 --> 14:13.954
LOOK, PRINCIPAL PERRY,
THIS PAINTING IS OUR DAD'S,

14:13.954 --> 14:15.525
AND ADAM ACCIDENTALLY
THREW IT AWAY,

14:15.525 --> 14:17.327
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT WE GET IT BACK.

14:17.327 --> 14:20.030
OH. I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T GIVE IT BACK.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.162
IT HAS SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.294
BUT YOU JUST FOUND IT.

14:24.294 --> 14:26.466
NOT TO ME. TO YOU!

14:26.466 --> 14:28.868
( laughing )
PLAYING THROUGH!

14:31.171 --> 14:34.444
WELL, LAST ROOM IN THE HOUSE
AND NO FORGED ART,

14:34.444 --> 14:36.346
SO AS SOON AS
THOSE KIDS GET BACK

14:36.346 --> 14:40.480
WITH THAT ORIGINAL PAINTING,
 I AM SCOT-FREE.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.912
YOU KNOW,
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,

14:41.912 --> 14:43.213
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
WITH A GUY NAMED
SCOTT FREE,

14:43.213 --> 14:45.916
AND IRONICALLY,
HE WENT TO JAIL.

14:45.916 --> 14:48.318
YOU TALK A LOT.

14:48.318 --> 14:49.889
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
TALKS A LOT?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.022
PEOPLE WITH
SOMETHING TO HIDE.

14:52.022 --> 14:54.324
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO FIND
SOME OF THOSE.

14:54.324 --> 14:56.896
THIS HAS BEEN NICE.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.168
WHAT'S THAT?

14:58.168 --> 15:00.470
THAT? THAT--
THAT IS A--

15:00.470 --> 15:03.033
THAT'S A--
THAT'S A DOORBELL.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.134
A DOORBELL?
 YEAH.

15:04.134 --> 15:06.136
INSIDE THE HOUSE?
 MM-HMM, SURE.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.507
WELL, I MEAN I HAVE THE ONE
THAT RINGS INSIDE THE HOUSE.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.979
THIS ONE RINGS OUTSIDE

15:08.979 --> 15:10.280
SO I CAN MESS WITH THE PIZZA
GUY WHEN HE COMES.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.582
YOU KNOW--
BING-BONG, BING-BONG.

15:12.582 --> 15:15.185
I HATE PIZZA. ( chuckles )

15:16.246 --> 15:18.188
( mouths silently )

15:18.188 --> 15:19.919
( mouths silently )

15:22.322 --> 15:23.954
YOU HAVE A SECRET ELEVATOR?

15:23.954 --> 15:25.355
'COURSE I HAVE
A SECRET ELEVATOR.

15:25.355 --> 15:27.627
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
A SECRET ELEVATOR,
RIGHT, LEO?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.399
RIGHT! WE'RE--
WE'RE RICH.

15:29.399 --> 15:31.931
WE NEED TO BLOW
OUR MONEY ON SOMETHING!

15:31.931 --> 15:33.463
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING,
DAVENPORT?

15:33.463 --> 15:35.935
NOTHING! NOTHING!
WE'RE NOT HIDING
ANYTHING, RIGHT, LEO?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.167
RIGHT!

15:37.167 --> 15:39.609
WELL, THEN, I GUESS
YOU WOULDN'T MIND
IF WE TAKE A LOOK.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.311
NO, WE DON'T MIND
AT ALL, RIGHT, LEO?

15:41.311 --> 15:43.213
WILL YOU STOP SAYING THAT!

15:43.213 --> 15:44.714
Agent Ryker: LET'S GO.

15:48.318 --> 15:51.021
GUYS, WE HAVE TO GET
THAT PAINTING BACK FROM PERRY.

15:51.021 --> 15:53.253
LOOK, I HAVE AN IDEA.
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.585
PRINCIPAL PERRY!

15:55.585 --> 15:57.727
UGH! WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:57.727 --> 16:00.130
LOOK, HOW 'BOUT
IF WE MAKE THIS SHOT,

16:00.130 --> 16:01.561
YOU GIVE US THE PAINTING?

16:01.561 --> 16:03.033
DONE.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.335
BUT IF YOU MISS THE SHOT,
THEN YOU THREE HAVE TO CUT

16:05.335 --> 16:08.198
ALL THE GRASS
IN THE FOOTBALL FIELD
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR...

16:08.198 --> 16:09.469
DEAL.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.402
...WITH THESE
MUSTACHE SCISSORS.

16:12.402 --> 16:15.275
WHY DO YOU HAVE
MUSTACHE SCISSORS?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.977
WHY DO YOU ASK
SO MANY QUESTIONS?

16:19.309 --> 16:21.511
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

16:21.511 --> 16:25.255
I DON'T PLAY COED.
I'M NOT A SAVAGE.

16:25.255 --> 16:27.287
THIS COURSE IS LADIES ONLY.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.988
WHICH MEANS...

16:28.988 --> 16:31.191
SHE HAS TO TAKE THE PUTT.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.393
GOOD LUCK, SKIRT.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.099
I-I'VE NEVER PLAYED
GOLF BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.171
DON'T WORRY. I'LL USE
MY MOLECULAR-KINESIS

16:41.171 --> 16:42.472
TO GUIDE THE BALL.

16:42.472 --> 16:44.674
QUIT YOUR MUTTER
AND GRAB YOUR PUTTER!

16:44.674 --> 16:46.306
LET'S DO THIS!

16:54.184 --> 16:56.516
( blows trumpet )

16:59.519 --> 17:02.192
WOW! SHE P UT A CRAZY
SPIN ON THAT ONE, HUH?

17:19.809 --> 17:22.212
( laughs )

17:23.713 --> 17:25.175
CHASE, WHERE'S THE BALL?

17:25.175 --> 17:27.117
IT MUST HAVE GOT
STUCK IN THE PIPE!

17:27.117 --> 17:29.379
I WIN, I WIN, I WIN!

17:29.379 --> 17:31.651
( ball rolling )
 HUH? OH.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.722
UH-OH.

17:37.087 --> 17:39.289
YES!

17:39.289 --> 17:41.231
( comical shrieks )

17:41.231 --> 17:42.762
GET THE PAINTING!

17:48.568 --> 17:53.573
♪ TWINKLE, TWINKLE
LITTLE STAR ♪

17:53.573 --> 17:58.077
♪ HOW I WONDER
WHAT YOU ARE ♪

17:58.077 --> 18:00.410
IS THAT YOU SINGING?

18:00.410 --> 18:02.312
YEAH. ( chuckles )

18:02.312 --> 18:05.084
IT'S NEW. THOUGHT
I'D SPICE THINGS UP
A LITTLE BIT.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.817
IF YOU WANT A COPY,
I STILL HAVE 3,000 CDs LEFT.

18:10.190 --> 18:14.264
I THINK I CAN SPEAK
FOR EVERYONE WHEN I SAY,
"WE'RE GOOD."

18:19.329 --> 18:22.802
AND THIS IS MY ART VAULT.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.235
SO YOU'RE NOT A FORGER,
BUT YOU HAVE A SECRET ROOM

18:25.235 --> 18:27.307
FULL OF COPIED PAINTINGS.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.638
THESE ARE ORIGINALS.

18:28.638 --> 18:30.310
THAT I BELIEVE.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.811
IF YOU ASK ME,

18:31.811 --> 18:35.285
THESE PAINTINGS
SHOULD HANG THEMSELVES.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.188
WHEN ARE THEY GONNA GET HERE
WITH THAT PAINTING?

18:38.188 --> 18:39.449
I'VE BEEN TEXTING THEM.

18:39.449 --> 18:42.222
ADAM SAYS THEY'RE PLAYING
PUTT-PUTT WITH PERRY.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.194
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:44.194 --> 18:46.356
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

18:46.356 --> 18:49.429
WE HAVE TO DISTRACT
THESE AGENTS BEFORE
THEY FIND THE LAB.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.201
ON IT.

18:51.201 --> 18:52.302
HEY, WANNA HEAR A JOKE?
 NO.

18:52.302 --> 18:54.364
TWENTY QUESTIONS?
 NO.

18:54.364 --> 18:56.306
A POEM IT IS.

18:57.507 --> 18:59.809
WHEN THE NIGHT TURNS
INTO DAWN,

18:59.809 --> 19:02.372
LIGHTS, SHADOWS,

19:02.372 --> 19:04.474
A NEW DAY HAS BEGUN.

19:04.474 --> 19:06.816
HEY, I'VE GOT ONE
FOR YOU.

19:06.816 --> 19:09.719
"ROSES ARE RED,
VIOLETS ARE BLUE,

19:09.719 --> 19:11.221
STOP TALKING."

19:12.382 --> 19:13.783
OKAY, LOOKS LIKE
THIS ROOM'S CLEAR.

19:13.783 --> 19:15.625
SINCE THAT'S THE LAST
ROOM IN THE HOUSE,

19:15.625 --> 19:18.358
I GUESS THAT MEANS--
 YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER FLOOR.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.889
N-NO I DON'T.

19:19.889 --> 19:21.391
THEN WHAT WAS THAT
UNLABELED BUTTON

19:21.391 --> 19:23.463
ON THE ELEVATOR'S
CONTROL PANEL?

19:23.463 --> 19:25.835
THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION
FOR THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR,

19:25.835 --> 19:29.239
AND HE IS NOT HERE TODAY,
RIGHT, LEO?

19:29.239 --> 19:31.901
I AM NOT GOING
TO JAIL WITH YOU.

19:31.901 --> 19:33.373
YOU EITHER TAKE US THERE,

19:33.373 --> 19:34.804
OR I'LL MAKE YOU
TAKE US THERE.

19:35.905 --> 19:37.207
WE HAVE THE PAINTING!

19:37.207 --> 19:38.208
HA! THEY HAVE THE PAINTING!

19:38.208 --> 19:40.750
I'M FREE! I'M FREE!

19:40.750 --> 19:44.183
I MEAN, THANK YOU
FOR COMING, OFFICER.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.185
THIS PROVES
MR. DAVENPORT
IS INNOCENT.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.358
PROVES.
 WELL, I'LL BE THE JUDGE
OF THAT, MISS.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.322
( beeping sound )

19:52.322 --> 19:54.764
KID'S RIGHT.
IT CHECKS OUT.

19:54.764 --> 19:57.227
SORRY ABOUT
THE INCONVENIENCE,
MR. DAVENPORT.

19:57.227 --> 19:59.399
GOOD LUCK
WITH THE SINGING CAREER.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.231
YOU'VE, UM...

20:01.231 --> 20:03.233
REALLY GOT SOMETHING.

20:06.276 --> 20:08.908
MY ALBUM'S AVAILABLE
ONLINE, SO...

20:08.908 --> 20:10.840
WHAT'S AN ALBUM?

20:13.243 --> 20:16.286
THAT WAS CLOSE.
TOO CLOSE.

20:16.286 --> 20:18.288
THE FEDS WERE JUST ABOUT
TO DISCOVER THE LAB.

20:18.288 --> 20:20.590
WE DIDN'T MEAN FOR
ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.

20:20.590 --> 20:22.422
THINGS JUST
GOT OUT OF HAND.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.554
WE'RE REALLY SORRY,
MR. DAVENPORT.

20:24.554 --> 20:25.825
YEAH.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.797
WE PROMISE WE'LL ALWAYS
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

20:27.797 --> 20:29.259
YEAH.

20:29.259 --> 20:30.330
( sighs )

20:30.330 --> 20:31.831
YOU'RE SELFISH,
YOU'RE BOSSY,

20:31.831 --> 20:34.233
AND I WISH I DIDN'T,
BUT I LOVE YOUR VOICE.

20:36.566 --> 20:39.008
MAN, I'M SO HAPPY
I GOT THAT OFF MY CHEST.

20:39.008 --> 20:40.710
GIVE ME THAT.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.376
IT'S DESTROYED.
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING IT UP?

20:46.376 --> 20:48.278
SO THAT EVERY TIME
YOU LOOK AT IT,

20:48.278 --> 20:50.380
YOU'LL REMEMBER
THAT YOU OWE ME

20:50.380 --> 20:51.921
A MILLION DOLLARS.

21:00.530 --> 21:03.593
AH. OKAY.
HERE'S THE SHOT--

21:03.593 --> 21:04.894
OFF THE RAIL,
HIT THE ROCK,

21:04.894 --> 21:07.367
OFF THAT THING,
OFF THE POST,
OFF THE GUITAR,

21:07.367 --> 21:09.769
OFF THE FRONT DOOR,
AND INTO THE UMBRELLA STAND.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.801
NO WAY.
 NEVER.

21:11.801 --> 21:13.603
I NEED A SISTER.

21:18.047 --> 21:19.449
FORE!

21:22.452 --> 21:24.514
GOOD NEWS! I GOT
A NEW VON SCHTOPP!

21:26.285 --> 21:28.658

21:28.658 --> 21:31.290

21:34.394 --> 21:35.625
