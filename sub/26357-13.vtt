WEBVTT

00:10.644 --> 00:14.415
-Mmm. Bleh.
-D'oh!

00:14.448 --> 00:15.883
(phone ringing)

00:15.916 --> 00:17.418
Y'ello.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.387
Dad, I'm sleeping over
at Milhouse's

00:19.420 --> 00:20.954
and I can't take it.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.424
Come on, Bart, read me to sleep.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.127
And do the voices.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.628
(high-pitched voice):
"I'm ruler,"

00:27.661 --> 00:28.996
(normal voice):
said Yertle.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.731
(high-pitched voice):
"Of all that I see."

00:30.764 --> 00:32.366
Could we try that again?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.202
And hit "I'm" a little harder.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.937
"I'm ruler,"
(normal voice): said Yertle.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.006
Faster and this time
hit "said."

00:39.039 --> 00:40.808
(normal voice):
That makes no sense.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.177
Okay, we'll do it your way,
then my way,

00:43.211 --> 00:46.314
and I'll see what works
in editing. (chuckles)

00:46.347 --> 00:48.849
Dad, get me outta here.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.651
Sorry, boy,
you know the rule.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.887
Accept the invite,
stay the night.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.056
(phone ringing)

00:56.090 --> 00:59.026
Hello, Yertle. (laughs)

00:59.059 --> 01:01.329
(gasps) Oh. Oh, my God.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.097
I-I'll be on the next plane.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.498
(whimpers): Oh.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.799
What's wrong, honey?

01:05.833 --> 01:08.035
My Aunt Eunice is dying.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.903
I have to leave right away.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.905
HOMER:
Oh, poor Marge.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.974
Wait. She said "I," not "we."

01:14.007 --> 01:15.376
I don't have to go.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.978
(laughing)

01:18.011 --> 01:21.081
(sobbing)

01:21.115 --> 01:23.517
Aw, you love her, too.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.754
(laughing, sobbing)

01:29.823 --> 01:31.992
Sweetie, do you want to come?

01:32.025 --> 01:34.995
Uh, uh, w-with all my heart.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.198
Uh, but the children need me.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.233
(clock ticking)

01:43.371 --> 01:46.207
(crying) Oh.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.176
(phone ringing)

01:48.209 --> 01:49.543
Y'ello.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.779
BART (over phone):
Dad, I am begging you.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.046
Who is this?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.482
MARGE (sighs):
Okay.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.550
I made a loaf
of peanut butter and jelly.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.320
You just have to slice it
into sandwiches every day.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.088
-Check.
-I set the Roomba up

02:01.121 --> 02:02.456
to cope with your cleaning.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.492
(motor whirring)

02:08.095 --> 02:09.997
-Check.
-I made a welcome wagon basket

02:10.030 --> 02:12.065
for our new neighbors
from Eastern Europe.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.967
-Check.
-Not Czech, Slovenian.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.569
-Check.
-(car horn honking)

02:15.603 --> 02:19.573
One last thing--
this is very important, Homer.

02:19.607 --> 02:23.177
The new season of Odder Stuff
drops on Netflix tonight.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.778
Ooh, ooh. Something to do.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.215
Do not watch it without me.

02:27.248 --> 02:31.219
What? Why not? I have to see if
my fan theories are correct.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.121
(loud whisper):
I think it's set in the '80s.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.989
-(car horn honks)
-Homer, the nine hours

02:36.023 --> 02:39.793
we binge watch that show
together is our thing.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.995
And we don't have
a lot of things.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.832
But holding hands
in a darkened room

02:44.865 --> 02:46.800
with my head on your shoulder

02:46.834 --> 02:50.804
has become the glue
that seals our love.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.773
I get it.
I totally get it.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.007
I know I'm not perfect.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.277
Sometimes I forget
our marriage birthday.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.178
-Our anniversary?
-Yes.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.648
And sometimes I forget
your birth anniversary,

03:00.681 --> 03:03.751
but I promise I will not watch
our show without you.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.653
Thank you, Homie.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.988
AUNT EUNICE:
Thank you girls for coming.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.359
Dearest, you were always
our favorite aunt.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.160
Psst, over here.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.195
When she's gone,
I get the P's,

03:15.229 --> 03:16.730
Selma gets the S's.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.166
You get to notify the utilities.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.469
Can't this wait until
after she's dead?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.103
I'll be too busy grieving.

03:23.136 --> 03:27.341
Yeah. Too busy grieving
I got the salt shaker. (laughs)

03:27.375 --> 03:31.078
Easy-peasy.
"P" for salt, "S" for pepper.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.347
I'm walking towards a light...

03:33.381 --> 03:34.682
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.985
...with a Post-it on it.
(grunts)

03:38.018 --> 03:39.487
Uh-oh.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.188
Okay, sweetie, here's a book

03:41.221 --> 03:44.157
that can help you fall asleep.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.494
No, no, no. No, sweetie.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.896
You chew it, like this. Look.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.498
(munching)

03:50.531 --> 03:53.066
Yummy book. Mmm.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.903
Oh. (moaning)

03:55.936 --> 03:57.671
Hey. (chuckles)

03:57.705 --> 04:00.107
(moaning)

04:00.140 --> 04:02.009
-(spooky music playing)
-(snoring)

04:02.042 --> 04:03.143
Hey, what?

04:03.176 --> 04:04.812
Huh.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.316
What's this?
What are you doing?!

04:08.349 --> 04:09.950
You guys can't watch this.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.353
Uh, no.
You can't watch this.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.588
We didn't promise Mom nothing.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.924
(both laugh)

04:16.957 --> 04:19.593
Children, there are 400 shows
you could watch right now.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.429
Many with Ted Danson.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.798
(growling, hissing)

04:24.832 --> 04:27.100
-(whimpers)
-(growling)

04:27.134 --> 04:29.202
Wait for me.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.171
(whimpering)

04:31.204 --> 04:33.173
MARGE:
This show you can watch.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.375
Too depressing.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.777
(bird caws)

04:36.810 --> 04:38.546
(spooky music playing)

04:38.579 --> 04:40.948
Oh. Ah! No.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.151
Must find place to avoid
pop culture discussions.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.253
I know. The watercooler.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.923
-...the Semi-Gorgon.
-...so many twists.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.392
-I know.
-...set in the '80s.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.093
And the Guffer Brothers.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.062
My turn to talk about
how much I liked it.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.397
Shouldn't doing something nice
for your wife

04:56.430 --> 04:57.965
feel better than this?

04:57.998 --> 05:00.634
Homer, will you read my
Odder Stuff fan fiction?

05:00.668 --> 05:02.403
I threw it over
Stephen King's fence

05:02.436 --> 05:04.071
but i-it hit him on the head.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.439
Why Stephen King?

05:05.473 --> 05:07.140
Eh, he's got a low fence.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.676
Mmm...

05:08.709 --> 05:11.144
(gurgling)

05:11.178 --> 05:12.613
Don't worry, kids.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.615
Sideshow Mel will be fine.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.450
He has an air bubble.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.119
It's all carbon dioxide now!

05:19.152 --> 05:20.053
(bubbling)

05:20.087 --> 05:21.455
(groans)

05:21.489 --> 05:23.290
(sighs) This is the last time

05:23.323 --> 05:25.826
I buy a trick
from a magician's widow.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.834
Nobody's watching my show.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.136
What with the downloading
and the streaming,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.071
and the fact that
everything else is better.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.807
Now, you're my writers!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.174
You pay us like interns.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.810
And I'm your niece.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.244
-Hey-hey.
-Hey-hey.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.113
Now I want ideas.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.648
Why don't we do another
live special?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.650
What?
I can't remember lines.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.452
At my last wedding
I wrote "I do"

05:51.485 --> 05:53.186
on the rabbi's forehead.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.189
You could hide a golden ticket
in some candy like Willy Wonka.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.826
The only children allowed
in my factory

05:58.859 --> 06:00.661
are the ones that work there.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.329
-How 'bout we have a contest?
-(Krusty groans)

06:02.362 --> 06:04.865
Some lucky kid gets to run
around a Krusty store

06:04.898 --> 06:07.167
for five whole minutes
and take all the toys they want.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.970
It inspires buying,
it's easy to promote,

06:10.003 --> 06:12.139
and it's the third thing
someone pitched.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.574
I'm sold!

06:15.042 --> 06:18.412
(spooky music playing)

06:23.216 --> 06:26.086
Let's see what else
Netflix has to offer.

06:26.119 --> 06:30.057
"Because you watched an '80s
show featuring a monster..."

06:30.090 --> 06:33.561
Alf, Roseanne, Moonlighting,
The Cosby Show--

06:33.594 --> 06:35.162
They're all too scary.

06:37.164 --> 06:40.534
Ooh. (whimpering):
God forgive me.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.603
â™ª

06:44.738 --> 06:46.173
No. Only when we're together.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.575
It's our glue.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.142
Homer, I'm Ted Sarandos.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.744
Chief Content Officer
of Netflix.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.680
(gulps, whimpers)

06:52.713 --> 06:55.282
This can't be a dream because
I don't know who you are.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.885
I'm not a dream. Let's just say
I'm a manifestation

06:57.918 --> 07:00.253
of complex algorithms that know
everything about you.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.990
Well, I can't watch this
because...

07:03.023 --> 07:05.192
I know. I know.
Marge told you not to.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.727
Do you know that
she's been watching

07:06.760 --> 07:10.097
Scandinavian crime dramas
with full nudity without you?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.065
That nudity is story-driven.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.067
(laughing): Yeah, right.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.203
But Odder Stuff is our thing.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.705
No. Your thing's with us.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.972
She's just along for the ride.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.874
The account's in your name.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.043
Come on, come on,
watch it now.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.112
Because our subscription prices
will triple tomorrow.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.149
(spooky music playing)

07:48.301 --> 07:50.137
Wow. I finally finished
something

07:50.170 --> 07:52.039
I wasn't supposed to start.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.574
That is impressive.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.242
I won't even mind watching it
again with...

07:55.275 --> 07:56.777
-MARGE: Homer?!
-Uh-oh.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.045
The lady from my marriage.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.649
My aunt recovered.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.684
Why are you up at 5:00 a.m.?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.486
Still warm.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.524
You watched it.

08:10.558 --> 08:15.028
I finally learn
how little I mean to you.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.030
-Wait.
-(door slams)

08:17.064 --> 08:20.167
(crying): No.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.081
Marge, I am sorry.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.850
Come on, it's a stupid TV show.

08:36.884 --> 08:40.187
I don't want to hear your voice.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.188
Mmm...

08:44.157 --> 08:46.393
No. We're staying married.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.331
Enough with the rebuses.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.868
All right, I'll just grab my
pillow and sleep on the couch.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.338
-No. You'll sleep
right next to me.
-(sighs)

08:58.371 --> 09:02.175
Because I want you to feel
the bitter rays

09:02.209 --> 09:06.346
of ice coming
from my frozen soul.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.081
â™ª

09:10.150 --> 09:12.119
(shivering)

09:14.487 --> 09:17.024
Oh. Oh.
It's so bitterly cold.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.359
(grunting)

09:22.429 --> 09:23.864
MARGE:
I'm fine.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.032
(Homer sighs)

09:25.065 --> 09:26.399
KRUSTY (over TV):
To enter our contest,

09:26.433 --> 09:28.201
write down, in 15 words or less,

09:28.235 --> 09:31.371
why you love me
more than God and America.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.007
The top three essayists
will earn a chance

09:34.041 --> 09:36.076
to run roughshod through
a Krusty store

09:36.109 --> 09:40.213
and not get tased by security.
(laughs)

09:40.247 --> 09:43.516
Whoever fills the cart
with the most toys

09:43.550 --> 09:45.518
gets to keep them, free.

09:45.552 --> 09:49.757
And the other two get the worst
kind of squat: diddly.

09:49.790 --> 09:53.426
Diddly? You can't say
that word on TV.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.196
Employees and monkeys of this
network are not eligible.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.634
Lis, will you write
my essay for me?

10:00.668 --> 10:02.602
What, you can't even
come up with,

10:02.636 --> 10:05.038
"I love Krusty because
I'm a class clown

10:05.072 --> 10:07.240
and he's a clown with class"?

10:07.274 --> 10:10.210
Perfect. And the best thing is
I'm stealing it from you.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.079
Ooh, that'll impress 'em.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.748
Go ahead. But there's one thing
I want you to hear:

10:14.782 --> 10:18.618
when you win by cheating,
eventually you lose.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.987
Wait, sorry,
after you said "win,"

10:20.020 --> 10:21.722
I started thinking
about dirt bikes.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.991
(imitating dirt bike engine)

10:27.327 --> 10:30.063
â™ª

10:32.165 --> 10:34.802
You cheated on your wife, Homer.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.971
I waited for Lenny
before I watched.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.572
(growling)

10:39.606 --> 10:41.308
After this,
we've got a stand-up special

10:41.341 --> 10:42.743
from Chris Rock.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.244
Don't watch that
with your wife, either.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.546
(whimpering)

10:46.579 --> 10:49.082
(shouting)

10:49.116 --> 10:51.084
(muffled screaming)

10:52.019 --> 10:54.354
Quit sleeping in the garden!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.191
(snoring)

11:01.829 --> 11:04.097
-Dad?
-Huh?

11:04.131 --> 11:06.834
Sweetie, everything's fine.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.403
Dad, maybe you should be talking
to someone who's older than me.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.805
Ted Sarandos?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.173
Who's Ted Sarandos?

11:13.206 --> 11:15.108
I was hoping you knew.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.677
HOMER: Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.013
My son, what are your sins?

11:20.047 --> 11:22.716
Aside from thinking
our church has confession.

11:22.750 --> 11:26.019
I watched a binge-worthy TV show
without my wife.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.688
Was it The Crown?
Don't tell me how it ends.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.523
Doesn't she become queen?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.059
Oh, go to Hell.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.861
Aw, what am I gonna do?

11:33.894 --> 11:35.662
I don't know what she wants!

11:35.695 --> 11:37.630
Homer, sorry
to blow my own horn...

11:37.664 --> 11:39.166
(horn plays fanfare)

11:39.199 --> 11:41.301
...but Netflix knows your wife
better than you do.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.203
Do you know what
she watches incessantly

11:43.236 --> 11:44.671
when you're not around?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.073
Usually this thing.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.877
Dance shows! She loves 'em!

11:49.910 --> 11:52.813
Want to win her back?
Learn to dance, my puppet.

11:52.846 --> 11:57.450
Hmm. I have disappointed Marge
with my dancing in the past.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.652
â™ª

12:00.921 --> 12:02.155
(bones crack)

12:02.189 --> 12:03.690
(siren wailing)

12:03.723 --> 12:05.192
I'll do it!

12:05.225 --> 12:07.194
("The Blue Danube"
by Strauss playing)

12:07.227 --> 12:09.096
â™ª

12:16.369 --> 12:18.806
Did you guys
all let down your wives?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.373
I'm not that pathetic.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.911
I'm just paying $40 an hour
for basic human contact.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.079
(giggles)
Cha-cha-cha!

12:26.113 --> 12:29.149
(jazz riff playing)

12:29.182 --> 12:31.718
Hello. My name is Julia.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.753
Just remember
Julia believes in you.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.889
Julia will always
believe in you.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.926
Julia will stay with you
until you are a dancer.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.360
-What's my name?
-Homer.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.529
-No. My name.
-Julia.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.931
And why are you here?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.365
I need to learn how to dance

12:45.398 --> 12:48.201
-to get my wife back.
-(moans): Aw...

12:48.235 --> 12:51.371
It's been a long time
since a woman said that to me.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.974
(jazz riff playing)

12:58.511 --> 13:00.080
Now we begin.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.715
("The Blue Danube" playing)

13:05.118 --> 13:06.619
(Homer panting)

13:06.653 --> 13:09.156
Zoey B, Zoey T,
you work with these guys.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.025
This man needs one-on-one help.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.994
I don't know how
to tell you this,

13:14.027 --> 13:16.029
but you are a terrible dancer.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.798
Uh, it seems like you did know
how to tell me that.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.268
But I am taking you on
as my personal challenge,

13:21.301 --> 13:24.838
and when I take on a challenge,
I don't quit!

13:26.073 --> 13:27.807
(tango playing)

13:27.841 --> 13:29.276
(cracking)

13:29.309 --> 13:31.244
-(music stops)
-Okay, here's the first thing:

13:31.278 --> 13:34.214
when you step on my toe,
it causes me pain.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.017
Wow. I'm learning so much.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.820
(tango resumes)

13:40.854 --> 13:43.056
â™ª

13:46.994 --> 13:47.995
How's your toe?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.562
Doesn't matter.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.698
I don't quit and neither do you.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.572
(panting heavily)

13:59.606 --> 14:02.109
-(alarm beeps)
-(gasps)

14:02.142 --> 14:04.144
Homer, you're getting there.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.546
You're aware
of when the music is playing.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.449
(gasping):
Can't... dance.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.151
Marriage over.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.753
Will live... on boat.

14:13.786 --> 14:17.057
(sighs) I'm gonna have to do
something I didn't want to do.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.092
I'm bringing in my partner.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.493
Sweet Sal!

14:22.195 --> 14:24.497
Watch me. With one hand,
you can lead a woman.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.000
-I find that hard to...
-You have to come forward

14:27.034 --> 14:29.102
-when I do this.
-Mm?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.904
-You have to go back
when I do this.
-Mm.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.705
As I push my palm
into your back,

14:32.739 --> 14:35.909
-you're forced to turn here.
-I am. I am.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.112
Whoa...

14:39.146 --> 14:40.847
Back straight! Knees bent!

14:40.880 --> 14:43.116
Feet arched! Eyes merry!

14:43.150 --> 14:45.718
â™ª

14:45.752 --> 14:48.188

14:53.226 --> 14:55.528
(shrieking continues)

14:55.562 --> 14:57.230
(phone rings)

14:57.264 --> 14:59.266
Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.368
Homer? Nah, sorry, Midge.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.136
I ain't seen him in weeks.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.704
What do you mean?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.140
He told me he's been there
every night.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.575
Oh, oh, Homer Simpson.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.177
Oh, no, I thought
you were talking about,

15:10.210 --> 15:12.379
uh, Homer the blind poet
who wrote the Iliad

15:12.412 --> 15:14.214
and the Odyssey there, yeah.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.684
-'Cause he ain't been around
since, like, 720 BC.
-(groans)

15:22.122 --> 15:24.124
â™ª

15:33.266 --> 15:35.402
Another night at Moe's?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.004
Yeah. I'm beat.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.571
The couch.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.443
(tap-dancing)

15:46.813 --> 15:48.348
MARGE (calls):
Quiet!

15:51.151 --> 15:53.386
Okay, Homer, time to do a lift.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.288
Are you sure?
I'm pretty heavy.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.291
No, me. Just grab my waist
and hold on tight.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.060
I'm doing all the work.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.629
Oh. Oops.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.231
-(shrieks)
-We'll work on that.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.598
-Hey, hey!
-(microphone feedback)

16:05.632 --> 16:08.501
It's time
for Krusty's Toy Trample!

16:08.535 --> 16:10.603
We have three finalists.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.406
But only the first finisher
gets to keep his toys.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.942
Losers have to pay
the winner's income tax.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.013
We rehearsed this with monkeys,
and everything went great!

16:21.948 --> 16:23.816
â™ª

16:23.850 --> 16:27.087
BART: Now, to take out these
two losers in two seconds.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.090
Dead Grandma, is that you?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.491
On your marks,

16:31.524 --> 16:33.260
prepare to advance.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.495
-(Bart exhales)
-Commence!

16:38.765 --> 16:42.135
(up-tempo music playing)

16:48.108 --> 16:49.309
-No!
-No!

â™ª

16:55.048 --> 16:56.883
(music stops)

16:59.886 --> 17:01.988
â™ª

17:10.130 --> 17:12.099
Congratulations, kid!

17:12.132 --> 17:15.068
And you also won...
a day with Krusty!

17:15.102 --> 17:17.070
ANNOUNCER (speed-talking):
Day with Krusty will actually be

17:17.104 --> 17:18.505
day with Sideshow Mel.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.173
Don't we get anything?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.709
Of course.
You two get the greatest prize

17:22.742 --> 17:24.711
any kid could ask for:

17:24.744 --> 17:27.147
wooden paddles
with balls on 'em.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.182
Mine's broken already.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.717
Use your imagination.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.020
The ball is a rocket ship,
and the paddle is a...

17:34.053 --> 17:36.989
I don't know. Why am I wasting
my time with this kid?

17:37.023 --> 17:39.392
-Is he dying?
-Not that I know of.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.694
Well, then get him outta here!

17:41.728 --> 17:43.130
-(phone rings)
-(groans)

17:43.163 --> 17:44.164
HOMER (over speaker):
Marge, it's me.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.732
I want to ask you one favor,

17:45.765 --> 17:47.100
and I won't bother you again.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.235
There's a dress in the bedroom.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.470
Put it on and meet me
at 15th and Elm.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.004
Are you going to tell me

17:52.038 --> 17:53.673
where you've been spending
your nights?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.308
All will be made clear.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.709
(dial tone)

17:56.743 --> 17:58.245
Marge, go to him.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.480
If you don't,
he'll head off to the war,

18:00.513 --> 18:02.249
and you'll never see him again.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.417
He's not going to war.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.919
That coward!
He doesn't deserve my daughter!

18:10.790 --> 18:12.292
She's here.

â™ª

18:22.001 --> 18:24.103
You look beautiful.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.938
Cut it out.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.574
Why are we here?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.042
To dance.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.278
I don't know how.

18:31.311 --> 18:35.014
Marge, all you have to do is
one incredibly difficult thing:

18:35.047 --> 18:37.016
trust me.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.351
â™ª I'm here

18:38.385 --> 18:40.287
Oh.

18:41.221 --> 18:44.591
â™ª Let's dance

18:44.624 --> 18:46.025
(gasps)

18:46.058 --> 18:48.195

-Oh...

18:48.228 --> 18:49.529
Yeah.

18:49.562 --> 18:54.133
â™ª What's your name?

18:54.167 --> 18:55.502
MARGE:
Hmm.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.538
â™ª How do you do?

18:58.571 --> 18:59.972
Mmm...

19:00.006 --> 19:03.009
â™ª What's the game?

19:04.777 --> 19:08.948
â™ª Hallelujah

I've never seen this:

19:14.687 --> 19:17.724
Mom and Dad
romantically in love.

19:17.757 --> 19:21.093
(chuckles)
It's like rebirth. Ooh.

19:21.127 --> 19:24.096
It cures all the wounds.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.266
Aw.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.435
Bart, are you seeing this?

19:28.468 --> 19:31.170
I set a new record: 89.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.774
Wha... You missed the greatest
moment in our parents' lives.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.609
89's pretty good.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.945
â™ª How

19:38.978 --> 19:41.781
â™ª Do you do?

19:41.814 --> 19:45.918
Whoo! I have not felt this good
since I signed Shonda Rhimes.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.954
â™ª You're there

19:49.021 --> 19:49.989
â™ª I'm here

19:50.022 --> 19:53.326
Okay, Homer, catch and lift.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.597
â™ª But let's dance

â™ª What's your name?

20:07.674 --> 20:12.245
â™ª How do you do?

20:12.279 --> 20:15.181
â™ª What's the game?

-FLANDERS: Hey!

20:21.220 --> 20:22.855
Wait, how did you get a toy?

20:22.889 --> 20:25.658
It was a thank-you from Ralph
for writing his essay.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.327
You wrote Ralph's essay, too?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.829
It's called
hedging your bets, boys.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.399
Hi-yo, just desserts!

20:32.432 --> 20:35.201
Did someone say "just desserts"?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.737
Dad, it's just an expression.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.872
Just an expression, eh?

20:39.906 --> 20:42.174
I have to warn you,
we just have desserts.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.209
Oh...

21:29.121 --> 21:30.757
Shh!
