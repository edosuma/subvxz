WEBVTT

00:10.644 --> 00:14.415
-Mmm. Bleh.
-D'oh!

00:14.448 --> 00:15.883
(phone ringing)

00:15.916 --> 00:17.418
Y'ello.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.387
Dad, I'm sleeping over
at Milhouse's

00:19.420 --> 00:20.954
and I can't take it.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.424
Come on, Bart, read me to sleep.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.127
And do the voices.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.628
(high-pitched voice):
"I'm ruler,"

00:27.661 --> 00:28.996
(normal voice):
said Yertle.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.731
(high-pitched voice):
"Of all that I see."

00:30.764 --> 00:32.366
Could we try that again?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.202
And hit "I'm" a little harder.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.937
"I'm ruler,"
(normal voice): said Yertle.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.006
Faster and this time
hit "said."

00:39.039 --> 00:40.808
(normal voice):
That makes no sense.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.177
Okay, we'll do it your way,
then my way,

00:43.211 --> 00:46.314
and I'll see what works
in editing. (chuckles)

00:46.347 --> 00:48.849
Dad, get me outta here.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.651
Sorry, boy,
you know the rule.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.887
Accept the invite,
stay the night.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.056
(phone ringing)

00:56.090 --> 00:59.026
Hello, Yertle. (laughs)

00:59.059 --> 01:01.329
(gasps) Oh. Oh, my God.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.097
I-I'll be on the next plane.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.498
(whimpers): Oh.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.799
What's wrong, honey?

01:05.833 --> 01:08.035
My Aunt Eunice is dying.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.903
I have to leave right away.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.905
HOMER:
Oh, poor Marge.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.974
Wait. She said "I," not "we."

01:14.007 --> 01:15.376
I don't have to go.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.978
(laughing)

01:18.011 --> 01:21.081
(sobbing)

01:21.115 --> 01:23.517
Aw, you love her, too.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.754
(laughing, sobbing)

01:29.823 --> 01:31.992
Sweetie, do you want to come?

01:32.025 --> 01:34.995
Uh, uh, w-with all my heart.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.198
Uh, but the children need me.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.233
(clock ticking)

01:43.371 --> 01:46.207
(crying) Oh.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.176
(phone ringing)

01:48.209 --> 01:49.543
Y'ello.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.779
BART (over phone):
Dad, I am begging you.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.046
Who is this?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.482
MARGE (sighs):
Okay.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.550
I made a loaf
of peanut butter and jelly.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.320
You just have to slice it
into sandwiches every day.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.088
-Check.
-I set the Roomba up

02:01.121 --> 02:02.456
to cope with your cleaning.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.492
(motor whirring)

02:08.095 --> 02:09.997
-Check.
-I made a welcome wagon basket

02:10.030 --> 02:12.065
for our new neighbors
from Eastern Europe.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.967
-Check.
-Not Czech, Slovenian.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.569
-Check.
-(car horn honking)

02:15.603 --> 02:19.573
One last thing--
this is very important, Homer.

02:19.607 --> 02:23.177
The new season of Odder Stuff
drops on Netflix tonight.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.778
Ooh, ooh. Something to do.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.215
Do not watch it without me.

02:27.248 --> 02:31.219
What? Why not? I have to see if
my fan theories are correct.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.121
(loud whisper):
I think it's set in the '80s.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.989
-(car horn honks)
-Homer, the nine hours

02:36.023 --> 02:39.793
we binge watch that show
together is our thing.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.995
And we don't have
a lot of things.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.832
But holding hands
in a darkened room

02:44.865 --> 02:46.800
with my head on your shoulder

02:46.834 --> 02:50.804
has become the glue
that seals our love.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.773
I get it.
I totally get it.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.007
I know I'm not perfect.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.277
Sometimes I forget
our marriage birthday.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.178
-Our anniversary?
-Yes.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.648
And sometimes I forget
your birth anniversary,

03:00.681 --> 03:03.751
but I promise I will not watch
our show without you.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.653
Thank you, Homie.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.988
AUNT EUNICE:
Thank you girls for coming.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.359
Dearest, you were always
our favorite aunt.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.160
Psst, over here.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.195
When she's gone,
I get the P's,

03:15.229 --> 03:16.730
Selma gets the S's.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.166
You get to notify the utilities.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.469
Can't this wait until
after she's dead?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.103
I'll be too busy grieving.

03:23.136 --> 03:27.341
Yeah. Too busy grieving
I got the salt shaker. (laughs)

03:27.375 --> 03:31.078
Easy-peasy.
"P" for salt, "S" for pepper.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.347
I'm walking towards a light...

03:33.381 --> 03:34.682
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.985
...with a Post-it on it.
(grunts)

03:38.018 --> 03:39.487
Uh-oh.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.188
Okay, sweetie, here's a book

03:41.221 --> 03:44.157
that can help you fall asleep.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.494
No, no, no. No, sweetie.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.896
You chew it, like this. Look.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.498
(munching)

03:50.531 --> 03:53.066
Yummy book. Mmm.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.903
Oh. (moaning)

03:55.936 --> 03:57.671
Hey. (chuckles)

03:57.705 --> 04:00.107
(moaning)

04:00.140 --> 04:02.009
-(spooky music playing)
-(snoring)

04:02.042 --> 04:03.143
Hey, what?

04:03.176 --> 04:04.812
Huh.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.316
What's this?
What are you doing?!

04:08.349 --> 04:09.950
You guys can't watch this.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.353
Uh, no.
You can't watch this.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.588
We didn't promise Mom nothing.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.924
(both laugh)

04:16.957 --> 04:19.593
Children, there are 400 shows
you could watch right now.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.429
Many with Ted Danson.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.798
(growling, hissing)

04:24.832 --> 04:27.100
-(whimpers)
-(growling)

04:27.134 --> 04:29.202
Wait for me.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.171
(whimpering)

04:31.204 --> 04:33.173
MARGE:
This show you can watch.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.375
Too depressing.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.777
(bird caws)

04:36.810 --> 04:38.546
(spooky music playing)

04:38.579 --> 04:40.948
Oh. Ah! No.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.151
Must find place to avoid
pop culture discussions.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.253
I know. The watercooler.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.923
-...the Semi-Gorgon.
-...so many twists.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.392
-I know.
-...set in the '80s.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.093
And the Guffer Brothers.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.062
My turn to talk about
how much I liked it.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.397
Shouldn't doing something nice
for your wife

04:56.430 --> 04:57.965
feel better than this?

04:57.998 --> 05:00.634
Homer, will you read my
Odder Stuff fan fiction?

05:00.668 --> 05:02.403
I threw it over
Stephen King's fence

05:02.436 --> 05:04.071
but i-it hit him on the head.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.439
Why Stephen King?

05:05.473 --> 05:07.140
Eh, he's got a low fence.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.676
Mmm...

05:08.709 --> 05:11.144
(gurgling)

05:11.178 --> 05:12.613
Don't worry, kids.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.615
Sideshow Mel will be fine.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.450
He has an air bubble.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.119
It's all carbon dioxide now!

05:19.152 --> 05:20.053
(bubbling)

05:20.087 --> 05:21.455
(groans)

05:21.489 --> 05:23.290
(sighs) This is the last time

05:23.323 --> 05:25.826
I buy a trick
from a magician's widow.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.834
Nobody's watching my show.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.136
What with the downloading
and the streaming,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.071
and the fact that
everything else is better.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.807
Now, you're my writers!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.174
You pay us like interns.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.810
And I'm your niece.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.244
-Hey-hey.
-Hey-hey.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.113
Now I want ideas.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.648
Why don't we do another
live special?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.650
What?
I can't remember lines.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.452
At my last wedding
I wrote "I do"

05:51.485 --> 05:53.186
on the rabbi's forehead.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.189
You could hide a golden ticket
in some candy like Willy Wonka.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.826
The only children allowed
in my factory

05:58.859 --> 06:00.661
are the ones that work there.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.329
-How 'bout we have a contest?
-(Krusty groans)

06:02.362 --> 06:04.865
Some lucky kid gets to run
around a Krusty store

06:04.898 --> 06:07.167
for five whole minutes
and take all the toys they want.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.970
It inspires buying,
it's easy to promote,

06:10.003 --> 06:12.139
and it's the third thing
someone pitched.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.574
I'm sold!

06:15.042 --> 06:18.412
(spooky music playing)

06:23.216 --> 06:26.086
Let's see what else
Netflix has to offer.

06:26.119 --> 06:30.057
"Because you watched an '80s
show featuring a monster..."

06:30.090 --> 06:33.561
Alf, Roseanne, Moonlighting,
The Cosby Show--

06:33.594 --> 06:35.162
They're all too scary.

06:37.164 --> 06:40.534
Ooh. (whimpering):
God forgive me.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.603
♪

06:44.738 --> 06:46.173
No. Only when we're together.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.575
It's our glue.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.142
Homer, I'm Ted Sarandos.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.744
Chief Content Officer
of Netflix.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.282
This can't be a dream because
I don't know who you are.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.885
I'm not a dream. Let's just say
I'm a manifestation

06:57.918 --> 07:00.253
of complex algorithms that know
everything about you.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.990
Well, I can't watch this
because...

07:03.023 --> 07:05.192
I know. I know.
Marge told you not to.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.727
Do you know that
she's been watching

07:06.760 --> 07:10.097
Scandinavian crime dramas
with full nudity without you?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.065
That nudity is story-driven.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.067
(laughing): Yeah, right.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.203
But Odder Stuff is our thing.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.705
No. Your thing's with us.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.972
She's just along for the ride.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.874
The account's in your name.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.043
Come on, come on,
watch it now.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.112
Because our subscription prices
will triple tomorrow.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.149
(spooky music playing)

07:48.301 --> 07:50.137
Wow. I finally finished
something

07:50.170 --> 07:52.039
I wasn't supposed to start.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.574
That is impressive.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.242
I won't even mind watching it
again with...

07:55.275 --> 07:56.777
-MARGE: Homer?!
-Uh-oh.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.045
The lady from my marriage.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.649
My aunt recovered.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.684
Why are you up at 5:00 a.m.?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.486
Still warm.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.524
You watched it.

08:10.558 --> 08:15.028
I finally learn
how little I mean to you.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.030
-Wait.
-(door slams)

08:17.064 --> 08:20.167
(crying): No.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.081
Marge, I am sorry.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.850
Come on, it's a stupid TV show.

08:36.884 --> 08:40.187
I don't want to hear your voice.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.188
Mmm...

08:44.157 --> 08:46.393
No. We're staying married.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.331
Enough with the rebuses.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.868
All right, I'll just grab my
pillow and sleep on the couch.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.338
-No. You'll sleep
right next to me.
-(sighs)

08:58.371 --> 09:02.175
Because I want you to feel
the bitter rays

of ice coming
from my frozen soul.

write down, in 15 words or less,

why you love me
more than God and America.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.007
The top three essayists
will earn a chance

09:34.041 --> 09:36.076
to run roughshod through
a Krusty store

09:36.109 --> 09:40.213
and not get tased by security.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.516
Whoever fills the cart
with the most toys

gets to keep them, free.

And the other two get the worst
kind of squat: diddly.

09:49.790 --> 09:53.426
Diddly? You can't say
that word on TV.

Employees and monkeys of this
network are not eligible.

my essay for me?

come up with,

10:02.636 --> 10:05.038
"I love Krusty because
I'm a class clown

10:05.072 --> 10:07.240
and he's a clown with class"?

10:07.274 --> 10:10.210
Perfect. And the best thing is
I'm stealing it from you.

Ooh, that'll impress 'em.

Go ahead. But there's one thing
I want you to hear:

10:14.782 --> 10:18.618
when you win by cheating,
eventually you lose.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.987
Wait, sorry,
after you said "win,"
