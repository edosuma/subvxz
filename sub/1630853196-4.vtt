00:06.200 --> 00:07.400
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:07.480 --> 00:08.640
<i>Van Tiggelen.</i>

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
<i>Stepping in well.</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:14.120
<i>Mühren.</i>

00:15.400 --> 00:16.480
<i>Towards Van Basten.</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:22.320
<i> Marco van Basten!</i>
<i>Goal! Marco van Basten! 2-0!</i>

00:22.400 --> 00:24.800
<i>Yes, Michels can't believe his eyes.</i>

00:24.880 --> 00:26.800
<i>It was 1988.</i>

00:26.880 --> 00:29.920
<i>A year after the opening</i>
<i>of Teledutch's new style.</i>

00:30.520 --> 00:33.160
<i>It was the summer</i>
<i>when the Netherlands won the Euros.</i>

00:33.720 --> 00:37.080
<i>We even beat West Germany</i>
<i>in the semifinals,</i>

00:37.160 --> 00:40.280
<i>and that was important,</i>
<i>not just because of the war.</i>

00:40.360 --> 00:43.800
<i>It also had something to do</i>
<i>with the 1974 World Cup.</i>

00:44.880 --> 00:49.000
<i>I'm not into soccer at all,</i>
<i>but in the summer of '88, I was.</i>

00:52.280 --> 00:55.280
<i>It was also the start</i>
<i>of the Second Summer of Love.</i>

00:55.760 --> 00:57.880
<i>Not that anyone called it that,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

00:58.360 --> 01:00.880
<i>With the help of ecstasy</i>
<i>and illegal raves,</i>

01:00.960 --> 01:03.480
<i>house music caught on all over Europe…</i>

01:06.480 --> 01:08.040
<i>except in the Netherlands.</i>

01:08.760 --> 01:12.840
<i>The RoXY had finally opened,</i>
<i>but the big crowds stayed away.</i>

01:12.920 --> 01:14.680
<i>They preferred pop music.</i>

01:14.760 --> 01:17.880
<i>And after six months,</i>
<i>the place was as good as bankrupt.</i>

01:17.960 --> 01:19.960
The only reason no one is coming here

01:20.040 --> 01:22.000
is because
you keep playing that shit music.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.520
The nights we play disco are just as slow.
Besides, there was a soccer game on.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.920
Yeah, and they should've
been celebrating here.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.760
Who thinks it's because of the music?
Show of hands.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.600
Fine. You can all go
and work somewhere else.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.360
Because I'm in charge of the music!

01:39.440 --> 01:40.840
No, my money's in this too!

01:40.920 --> 01:45.200
If this isn't a success within two months,
you're going to play Terence Trent D'Arby.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.640
Fuck off with Terence Trent D'Arby.

01:47.720 --> 01:48.920
Yes, go.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.040
-I hate the mainstream shit.
-Goddamn it.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.600
Fuck off. Janna, leave me alone.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.720
Jesus.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.640
It'll be fine.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.240
It's a success in England, right?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.080
Can you stop?

02:04.640 --> 02:05.520
Jantje.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.960
<i>The first Summer of Love</i>
<i>was in 1967,</i>

02:34.040 --> 02:36.440
<i>so I can't say</i>
<i>I remember much of that one.</i>

02:36.520 --> 02:38.320
<i>But I remembered the second one.</i>

02:39.720 --> 02:43.520
<i>Living on my own</i>
<i>finally started to pay off.</i>

02:43.600 --> 02:45.080
<i>His name was Peter.</i>

02:45.160 --> 02:46.400
<i>Or Patrick.</i>

02:47.280 --> 02:48.880
<i>And he really did his best.</i>

02:48.960 --> 02:52.760
Yes. I'm almost there.
Are you coming too?

02:54.080 --> 02:55.320
Three quarters of all women

02:55.400 --> 02:58.680
are unable to reach an orgasm
during penetration.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.720
Not surprising,

02:59.800 --> 03:02.840
since there's hardly any contact
between the penis and the clitoris.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.680
And here I was thinking it was just me.

03:04.760 --> 03:05.640
Yes.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.680
<i>So as not to disappoint anyone,</i>
<i>I decided to fake it.</i>

03:12.640 --> 03:14.560
<i>Not that anyone noticed.</i>

03:29.680 --> 03:32.120
-How was it for you?
-So good.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.560
Holland!

03:40.520 --> 03:42.880
Marco van Basten!

03:50.520 --> 03:52.680
<i>Frank was back together</i>
<i>with Anouk.</i>

03:52.760 --> 03:56.120
<i>They lived in his dream house</i>
<i>in the middle of Amsterdam.</i>

03:56.200 --> 03:59.560
<i>And with Frank about to be a father,</i>
<i>he decided, as usual,</i>

03:59.640 --> 04:01.240
<i>to give it the full 200 percent.</i>

04:16.640 --> 04:19.840
Where were you?
I called the office like 100 times.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.680
-Ah. There you are. A little late.
-What…

04:24.520 --> 04:26.200
Congratulations. You have a son.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Hey.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.400
Hey, little guy.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.520
Hey, little dude. Oh, he's perfect.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.240
Hey.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.480
Shall we call him Marco?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.160
<i>Okay, the day after.</i>

04:59.240 --> 05:00.480
Yes, thank you.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.360
<i>It's always awkward</i>
<i>to tell someone</i>

05:03.440 --> 05:05.600
<i>you'd rather call it a day.</i>

05:06.480 --> 05:09.360
-Till next time?
-Yes… yes.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.240
-Ah. It was fun.
-Yes.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.080
Would you like
to go to the movies sometime?

05:15.560 --> 05:17.680
Um…Yes, great.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.920
-Great. I'll call you.
-Yes, sure.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.400
How many nights
have I spent in bars and cinemas

05:25.480 --> 05:27.640
with guys I wasn't interested in…

05:27.720 --> 05:30.000
The very first personal computer
was the Osborne 1.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.240
- 64
- KB of internal memory
and a five-inch, two-part color display.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.800
I taught my dog to get down.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.160
Then it lies on its back
with its legs open.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.800
-So, bye.
-Yes, bye.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.280
In my time,
you couldn't break up via WhatsApp.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.240
It would've saved me so much trouble.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.720
Hi. Good morning.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.120
Hi.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.680
Marly.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.880
-How's it going?
-Good.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.360
Can I come in?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.120
I actually need to get to work.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.320
Are you still recording those tapes?

06:22.400 --> 06:24.120
No, I don't do tapes anymore, Dad.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.760
Great. I'll pencil you in for 11:45, okay?

06:28.280 --> 06:29.160
Okay, bye.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.360
<i>-It was true I had quit recording tapes.</i>
-Here you go.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.000
<i>I had others to do that for me.</i>

06:34.080 --> 06:36.600
<i>Because somehow,</i>
<i>word had gotten out at the college</i>

06:36.680 --> 06:38.800
<i>that you could make good money through me.</i>

06:38.880 --> 06:41.360
Marly, wait. I want to ask you something.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.520
Is it true that…? I would like to…

06:44.600 --> 06:46.960
The sex tapes. Do they pay well?

06:47.040 --> 06:50.160
Yes, of course.
Are you sure it's your thing?

06:51.480 --> 06:57.920
Yes. Oh, God. I'm so wet. Yes.
Oh, my God. Yes, there. Yes. Oh, my God.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.120
Yes, fuck me! Yes!

07:02.200 --> 07:07.920
There! Harder! Yes! There! Harder! Yes!

07:08.000 --> 07:08.840
Rachel.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.920
Could you please move
further away from the microphone?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.080
Sorry, I'm pretty loud when I come.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.200
Rachel had also started to experiment.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.120
<i>The most prim and proper,</i>
<i>well-spoken field hockey girls</i>

07:26.200 --> 07:30.040
<i>transformed into trashy sex goddesses</i>
<i>in front of our microphones.</i>

07:30.120 --> 07:31.600
-Hi, ladies.
-Hi.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.160
Nien, here's the schedule
for studios one and two.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.200
Let me know if there are any no-shows,
because I have a waiting list.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.720
One of them went on
to become Secretary of State.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.040
I'm not naming names.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.240
HOURLY RATE FL 12.50

07:48.320 --> 07:50.040
<i>I was good at my job.</i>

07:50.120 --> 07:53.800
<i>And at the end of the week,</i>
<i>I'd receive my reward from our bookkeeper,</i>

07:54.360 --> 07:55.240
<i>Uncle Jaap.</i>

07:56.720 --> 07:58.640
Two hundred and fifty.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.000
And 25 extra

08:03.800 --> 08:05.960
-for being such a sweetie.
-Thank you.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.480
<i>This is how I made enough money</i>
<i>to treat myself to a new bike.</i>

08:15.000 --> 08:16.160
<i>Which, of course…</i>

08:16.240 --> 08:17.080
Goddamn it.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.240
<i>…was stolen within a week.</i>

08:20.120 --> 08:23.360
<i>It was Amsterdam, after all,</i>
<i>and junkies needed to make a living.</i>

08:24.320 --> 08:25.600
<i>But it was easily solved.</i>

08:25.680 --> 08:28.120
<i>I earned around 2,000 guilders,</i>

08:28.200 --> 08:30.880
<i>and with a 630-guilder grant on top,</i>

08:30.960 --> 08:33.680
<i>I was earning</i>
<i>quite a bit more than my dad.</i>

08:37.560 --> 08:40.960
Here, take this. And from now on,
I'll transfer a regular sum each month.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.240
I don't need money, Dad.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.360
You need to be able
to focus on your studies.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.440
It's summer break.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.440
I'll see what I can spare each month.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.720
Don't tell your mother.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.360
-Do we have everything?
-Yes.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.520
-Cloths?
-Check.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.800
-Pacifiers?
-Check.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.000
-Gift?
-Double check. Let's go.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.600
<i>…stick it in</i>
<i>your tight asshole.</i>

09:19.680 --> 09:22.440
<i>Oh.</i>

09:22.520 --> 09:23.840
-What is this?
-Uh.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.160
It's those tapes from work.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.360
<i>…tense--</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:30.080
I need to check them
for sound quality and…

09:31.160 --> 09:32.080
"Hot homo"?

09:32.600 --> 09:35.000
-In the car. Isn't that distracting?
-No.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.360
-Not with that kind of material.
-Story?

09:40.480 --> 09:41.320
Yes.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.360
Fairy tales.

09:46.080 --> 09:46.920
Fairy tales.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.480
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>long ago in a faraway land…</i>

09:51.000 --> 09:52.800
Hey, little Django.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.120
It's such a lovely name.
How did you come across it?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.680
You'll have to ask Anouk.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.720
I think we owe it
to the Dutch national team

10:01.800 --> 10:02.920
to call him Marco.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.200
If you'd been there when he was born,

10:05.280 --> 10:07.200
you would have had a say in it.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.560
Oh, how sweet. Look at that.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.200
-You see? He's a soccer player.
-Frank.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.680
-We brought you a present too.
-For you both.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.600
You'll have a lot of use for it too.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.520
You can tell
who did your interior design.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.120
Alexander says
it will gain a lot in value.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.600
Yes.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.360
Panasonic C! That's awesome.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.200
What's that?

10:39.800 --> 10:40.640
Telephone.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.000
Look.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.360
Car phone.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.200
It only weighs three kilos,
so you can carry it around with you

10:48.280 --> 10:50.120
-in a shoulder bag, if you want.
-Jesus.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.840
So you never have to miss
the birth of a child again.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.360
Yes, very funny, Natas.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.960
Yes, hello.
Is there anyone there?

11:04.680 --> 11:07.000
Did you buy that station wagon after all?

11:07.520 --> 11:10.240
Are you a traveling salesman?
Will you drive cross-country?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.800
I let Natas choose, so…

11:11.880 --> 11:14.320
You shouldn't give women a say, okay?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.920
Says the guy
who got grounded for two months.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.880
It's parental leave, the latest thing.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.960
So you're not coming
into the office at all?

11:23.720 --> 11:26.480
-I have to make it up to her.
-Exactly. You're grounded.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.520
I'm this close to making a million.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.960
I surpassed that ages ago.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.840
You should spend less.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.280
Turnover is profit. VAT is holiday pay.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.800
<i>Frank had been spending money</i>
<i>like water over the past few months.</i>

11:45.880 --> 11:50.600
<i>And to top it off, he'd bought a villa</i>
<i>in Amsterdam's most expensive quarter.</i>

11:50.680 --> 11:52.080
<i>So it was hardly surprising</i>

11:52.160 --> 11:55.000
<i>that he hadn't made his first million yet.</i>

11:55.960 --> 11:57.120
<i>Ramon was somewhat</i>

11:57.640 --> 11:59.320
<i>more modest in his purchases.</i>

11:59.400 --> 12:00.800
Wow. A games console.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.120
Yes. I guess we'll need a new TV then.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.160
-Yes.
-Yes.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.320
<i>And now that Frank was grounded,</i>
<i>Ramon had the chance</i>

12:09.400 --> 12:13.120
<i>to prove he was capable</i>
<i>of more than connecting plugs and wires.</i>

12:15.120 --> 12:17.040
You won't last a week, man.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.800
I'm a dad now.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.280
-Everything's changed.
-Yes.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.560
You're a dad.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.520
Give it your best.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.760
<i> With Teledutch getting some</i>
<i>serious competition for the first time,</i>

12:32.840 --> 12:35.120
<i>it would have to pull out all the stops.</i>

12:35.200 --> 12:36.880
That's good, Johnny.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.800
Guys, must you do that on the pool table?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.120
Let's have it. What's the damage?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.280
There's not a speck on it.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.960
I'm talking about the turnover.

12:52.040 --> 12:55.840
The competition is catching up with us.
Look how many ads there are.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.760
Well?

12:57.280 --> 13:01.240
Well, our takings have fallen
by 30 percent over the past month.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.080
And they're expected to fall even further.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.960
-Let's start a few extra lines.
-All 300 lines are taken, John.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.520
All we can do is replace the lines
that aren't performing well with new ones.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.720
Right, let's start
by dumping that comedy line.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.240
Is Frank okay with that?

13:16.200 --> 13:17.080
Frank's not here.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.360
I was thinking about a snore line.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.960
Hey… No, I'm serious, guys.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.640
I met a woman who does meditation
for people suffering from insomnia.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.880
She has a very soothing voice
for recording tapes

13:34.960 --> 13:36.480
to lull people to sleep.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.120
I don't know, John.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.800
Why don't we do something soccer related?

13:40.880 --> 13:44.480
-Sex with the Dutch team.
-I'd call in for that.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.960
No, I'm not talking about sex.
I mean scores, analysis,

13:48.040 --> 13:49.400
things that men like.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.000
Why aren't we
doing stuff for women anyway?

13:52.520 --> 13:56.000
They make up half the population
and we're not making any money off them.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.160
A sex line for women?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.840
No way.
Women wouldn't be interested in that.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.440
Yes, they would.
You all love those steamy love stories.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.320
Yes, the Bouquet Series.
My ex used to read those.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.040
Yes. But that's romance.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.400
Well, they gave her the weirdest ideas.
She made me wear a doctor's coat.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.840
I still have a stethoscope at home.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.240
-Well, there you go.
-I think it's a good idea.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.960
No one else has it.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.880
Yes. And no one else has a snore line.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.680
We'll do both.
John, you do the snore line.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.400
And Marly, you do the women's line.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.840
-But I--
-Great meeting. Thank you.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.440
"In one fluid movement,
I tear off his shirt

14:34.520 --> 14:37.760
and kiss his neck and his chest,

14:37.840 --> 14:40.440
which tastes salty
from our day at the beach."

14:40.520 --> 14:44.200
"He picks me up with his strong arms
and lays me on the table."

14:44.280 --> 14:48.320
-I thought you just ate.
-Maybe they did the dishes first.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.280
Hello, I'm reading here.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.800
-Yes, but it's been five minutes.
-Times 50 cents a minute.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.920
By the time my pants come off,
I'll be broke.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.080
For men, it's so much quicker.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.800
Yes, hello. Women need
more of a backstory to get in the mood.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.960
Nobody's going to phone in
to a sex line for women.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.720
Look at the Dutch <i>Playgirl.</i>
It was discontinued after four months.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.040
Those are photos.

15:15.120 --> 15:19.200
If I'm honest, a hard dick
doesn't turn me on at all.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.200
Unless I made it hard myself.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.520
Yes.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.600
Frank.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.880
-Frank.
-What?

15:42.960 --> 15:44.840
Can you take him? I'm exhausted.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.640
Why don't you put him down?

15:47.160 --> 15:49.600
-He'll start crying.
-Then let him cry.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.400
I don't want to.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.120
Why don't I take him out?
You can get some sleep.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.120
Poekie.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.040
I'm not just here to butter your toast.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.160
If you want me at home
for two months for you and the little one,

16:10.240 --> 16:12.480
you'll have to trust me.
Hey, come on.

16:13.480 --> 16:17.200
-Hand behind his head.
-Yes. Here. Hey.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.800
-Will you stay nearby?
-Yes, I'll take the mobile.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.160
Mobile?

16:24.680 --> 16:25.520
Telephone.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.400
If anything happens, I'll call you.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.400
<i>Frank knew there were doubts</i>
<i>about him as a family man,</i>

16:38.200 --> 16:40.680
<i>and that's why failing wasn't an option.</i>

16:56.520 --> 16:59.280
Take a deep breath
in through your nose.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.440
Let your tummy rise up.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.200
Hold for a moment.

17:06.880 --> 17:11.080
And slowly exhale
while counting down from ten.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.840
Ten.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.600
Nine.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.920
Eight.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.600
…by Jean-Pierre
and then we should…

17:45.040 --> 17:49.560
Take one more breath
in through your nose. Very good.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.400
-Now we're going to repeat that…
-John speaking.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.360
<i>-Johnny, my man.</i>
-Hey, Frankie boy.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.760
-Hey. Hush.
-Breathe in…

17:55.840 --> 17:58.800
-How's it going with the little one?
-Just fine. I'm at a café.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.920
-Come join me for a beer?
-No. We're in the studio.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.080
-We're recording the snore line.
<i>-The what?</i>

18:04.160 --> 18:07.760
-What are you on about?
-The snore line.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.560
<i>-The snore line?</i>
-Dude.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.440
I've got to go.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.000
Bharatie, we'll pick it up
from where you start to count.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.440
The chain's been broken. I'll restart.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.720
No, that's really not necessary. I…

18:22.280 --> 18:24.680
-I'll paste it together.
-Thank you, Ronnie.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.440
I'd rather start from the beginning.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.080
I've tried everything,

18:30.760 --> 18:32.920
but I don't think
women would be interested

18:33.000 --> 18:36.440
in listening to stories like that,
let alone pay for them.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.520
-Well, maybe it's you.
-Why would it be me?

18:40.040 --> 18:42.320
Well, you're a little bit…

18:43.160 --> 18:45.600
Look, I know plenty of women who love it

18:45.680 --> 18:47.920
when I talk dirty to them on the phone.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.720
Hey, why doesn't Johnny write the stories?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.640
Hang on.
It's got nothing to do with the stories.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.760
Johnny's talking live
on the phone to them.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.480
That makes it a game.
It's entirely different.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.160
Of course that's exciting.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.880
Can't we have them call in?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.480
Like those phone games on the radio?

19:04.560 --> 19:07.480
No, those are one-on-one calls.
There's no money in that.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.160
There is if you record them.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.320
You mean, Johnny calling up
random women from the studio,

19:14.400 --> 19:16.320
which we then record and broadcast?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.240
Yeah, might work.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.640
I still thought it was a shit idea,
but at least it didn't come from me.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.600
Marly, can you put an ad in the paper?
We can go live next week.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.480
Here's Johnny.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.480
Hey.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.000
He's asleep.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.640
Did you know, you're a very good mother?

20:26.160 --> 20:27.240
That's sweet.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.480
There you go.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.760
-I can't drink yet.
-Just a drop, for the flavor. Huh?

20:52.560 --> 20:54.640
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.880
<i>…and prevent it.</i>

20:56.520 --> 20:59.320
I can't quite picture it,
Frank being a dad.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.800
-Hmm.
-Huh?

21:00.880 --> 21:03.960
<i> …also information</i>
<i>about the measures</i>

21:04.040 --> 21:05.880
<i>doctors and politicians find necessary…</i>

21:05.960 --> 21:07.960
I'm so glad I've got you.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.840
<i>…the news at 10:30,</i>

21:09.920 --> 21:13.160
<i>we will first be answering</i>
<i>practical questions, such as,</i>

21:13.240 --> 21:15.920
<i>"What is AIDS? How is it contracted?"</i>

21:16.000 --> 21:17.440
Do you think he'll cope?

21:17.520 --> 21:19.360
<i> "How can you avoid</i>
<i>contracting it?"</i>

21:19.440 --> 21:21.040
Frank? Yes.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.920
<i>"Safe sex, stop AIDS"</i>
<i>is the government's campaign slogan.</i>

21:24.000 --> 21:26.680
<i>You'll hear more about this</i>
<i>just after 9:00.</i>

21:26.760 --> 21:28.080
I'm glad I've got you too.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.080
<i>…a closer look</i>
<i>at AIDS treatments.</i>

21:30.160 --> 21:31.360
<i>At about a quarter to ten…</i>

21:38.760 --> 21:39.640
Anouk, leave him.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.080
He'll doze off again.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.560
-I'll be right back.
-Poekie.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.320
Did you buy diapers?

22:34.920 --> 22:35.840
We're almost out.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.320
-Hi.
-Hey.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.640
Couldn't you have thought about it
for one second, John?

22:57.720 --> 23:00.320
-You were there too.
-It's your responsibility.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.040
-You were going to set those lines up.
-Yes, but it was about the content.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.480
-How did you think it'd work?
-I don't know.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.880
You're the technician.
Couldn't you come up with something?

23:08.960 --> 23:11.200
As soon as
one of our managers is available,

23:11.280 --> 23:13.240
I'll make sure they call you back.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.000
Marly, you have to help.
I'm going crazy here.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.760
-What happened?
-The snore line.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.720
-What about it?
-It works really well.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.600
-It sends everyone straight to sleep.
-That's good, isn't it?

23:23.680 --> 23:25.960
No, because they can't hang up.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.360
And then they get bills
for thousands of guilders.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.760
What?

23:29.840 --> 23:32.160
Call a journalist
and fix this.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.360
Just think of something.
Like a technical glitch.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.000
-Yes--
-Get moving.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.720
I need Johnny
for the women's line this afternoon.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.320
Line's open from four o'clock.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.360
Don't worry.
He'll be just fine and dandy by then.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.000
-That's a really good dance.
-Right?

24:00.320 --> 24:01.240
Hey, Robine.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.120
How's it going?

24:07.480 --> 24:08.520
-You…
-Yes.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.360
You said you'd call.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.080
Yes. I lost your number.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.840
Seriously, I lost your number.
How are you?

24:18.200 --> 24:20.040
We're leaving for Ibiza tomorrow.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.200
Wow, Ibiza. That's great.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.440
-You could stop by.
-Okay.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.320
I'd have to see
if I can arrange it at work.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.280
You do that. I'm sure you'll find us.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.640
Come on.

24:38.120 --> 24:42.480
<i> Frank may have become a father,</i>
<i>but he remained a successful businessman.</i>

24:44.880 --> 24:46.480
<i>With a million in the bank.</i>

24:57.360 --> 24:59.560
-Be careful, okay?
-Yes.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.640
One more step. Yes. Stay there.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.520
-Keep your eyes closed.
-Okay.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.080
-No peeking.
-What is it?

25:07.160 --> 25:08.560
It's not my birthday.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.800
Take a look.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.280
Ta-da!

25:13.160 --> 25:16.400
One for you, one for me.
And we'll swap every day.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.240
A sports car.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.040
Two sports cars.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.040
There isn't even space for a car seat.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.600
-There's plenty of space in the trunk.
-The trunk?

25:31.680 --> 25:33.680
Django is in the car seat.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.400
Why buy a car
that you can't transport a child in?

25:36.480 --> 25:38.080
-Two.
-One for you, one for me.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.480
You're not doing this for me.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.280
-When did I ask you for a sports car?
-Babe, it's a Ferrari.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.040
-I don't want a Ferrari.
-Well, I do.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.760
I want a Ferrari.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.920
-And a Porsche.
-Congratulations. Have fun.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.440
Jesus, woman!

25:52.120 --> 25:54.200
Can't you just be happy for me for once?

26:06.840 --> 26:07.760
All right.

26:13.960 --> 26:14.840
Okay.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.240
-I'm ready.
-Okay, Johnny.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.200
It's about their fantasies, okay?

26:20.280 --> 26:23.080
What they as women
would like to experience with you.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.520
Marly, I'm an Italian.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.920
Johnny Santini always puts women first.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.600
We have a caller. I'll put it through.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.040
Hello. This is the Ladies Only line.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.880
I'm Johnny. What can I do for you?

26:48.960 --> 26:51.840
It's working. Carry on. Really.

26:52.760 --> 26:53.600
Hello?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.320
Honey, talk to me.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.000
<i>Hello, Klaas here.</i>

27:00.880 --> 27:03.480
Hey, Klaas.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.080
This is the Ladies Only line
and I don't think you're a lady.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.560
-<i>What? Are there no women here?</i>
-No, Klaas.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.920
Ladies Only line. It's just for women.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.680
-Klaas.
-Second attempt, John.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.000
<i>And it wasn't just Klaas.</i>

27:21.560 --> 27:24.000
Ladies Only. What can I do for you?

27:24.080 --> 27:25.880
<i>Are there any hot chicks here?</i>

27:26.680 --> 27:27.720
Ladies Only.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.880
<i> Do you have big breasts?</i>

27:29.960 --> 27:31.320
Goddamn it.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.520
Ladies Only.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.200
Hey, guys, I can't work like this.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.520
<i>But then…</i>

27:39.600 --> 27:42.160
Ladies Only. Talk to me.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.280
<i>Hi, this is Carolien.</i>
<i>Is this the Ladies Only line?</i>

27:45.360 --> 27:46.600
Hey, Carolien.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.640
Hey, Carolien.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.640
This is the Ladies Only line.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.200
I'm so glad you called.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.560
What can I do for you?

28:26.880 --> 28:27.720
Hello?

28:31.880 --> 28:32.720
Oi.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.880
…I want to pick it up,

28:38.960 --> 28:42.440
but I see your amazing legs
emerging from your skirt

28:42.520 --> 28:44.000
and I can't help myself.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.800
I have to touch your legs.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.000
I put my hand on your leg

28:48.080 --> 28:51.280
and I slide my fingers ever so slowly

28:51.920 --> 28:53.720
up the inside of your thigh…

28:53.800 --> 28:55.280
-What's going on?
-Hey.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.080
-Can you feel it?
-<i>Oh, yes.</i>

28:57.160 --> 28:58.600
-<i>Yes, I can feel it.</i>
-Yes?

28:59.240 --> 29:01.080
It's a very classy restaurant.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.760
I hope there isn't anyone else
at your table.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.200
<i>There is. My husband.</i>

29:05.280 --> 29:08.360
<i>My husband's sitting opposite us</i>
<i>and he's watching.</i>

29:08.440 --> 29:10.080
-He's looking at you?
-<i>Yes.</i>

29:11.200 --> 29:13.400
Keep looking at him
while I slide my fingers

29:13.480 --> 29:16.040
up your panties and inside you.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.320
-Who's the woman?
-Just some random person.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.640
Women can call in live. Nina's idea.

29:24.200 --> 29:27.880
-…slide inside you.
-<i>Yes.</i>

29:27.960 --> 29:30.680
-I go up and down, watching your husband.
-<i>Yes.</i>

29:30.760 --> 29:32.920
-I go up and down.
-<i>Oh, yes!</i>

29:33.000 --> 29:36.320
Up and down.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.280
Yes.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.000
Yes.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.240
Nice.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.960
He's done it again.
Johnny Santini, in the 94th minute.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.560
<i> It was as if the Netherlands</i>
<i>had won the championship all over again.</i>

29:54.640 --> 29:56.480
<i>But with the ladies' team this time.</i>

29:56.560 --> 29:59.160
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-You're welcome.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.920
Go! Come on!

30:03.000 --> 30:06.120
<i>There always seemed</i>
<i>to be a cause for celebration.</i>

30:06.640 --> 30:07.880
<i>The crazier, the better.</i>

30:07.960 --> 30:08.840
Come on.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.960
<i>Our parties were notorious.</i>

30:11.480 --> 30:12.840
<i>And Frank couldn't resist</i>

30:12.920 --> 30:16.040
<i>breaking away from being grounded.</i>

30:16.120 --> 30:19.080
Hey!

30:20.640 --> 30:24.920
What we really need
is an entire web of connections.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.680
They're trying that
with computers.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.160
That's not what I mean.
I mean you call in…

30:30.560 --> 30:34.040
Just like when we were kids.
With those cans and wires.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.160
-So you get this whole tangle of wires.
-A telephone.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.400
Cut it out, man.

30:40.040 --> 30:44.360
I mean you can talk to each other
but don't know who's on the other side.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.120
The other person doesn't know either.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.000
Better still, you could have
a group call with lots of people.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.720
-And we call it the Chatter Box.
-That's a good one.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.440
-Yes.
-Women would like that.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.480
To sit around yapping,
like in a bar.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.280
You can exchange numbers
if you really like each other.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.880
Couldn't you build
some kind of box for that?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.800
-Maybe it already exists.
-Hey, guys.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.400
Is this night going anywhere or what?

31:08.160 --> 31:11.160
-Um… I'm going to the RoXY.
-I'm having dinner with Joseph.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.040
-Who's Joseph?
-He's my boyfriend.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.520
You have a boyfriend?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.040
Yes. We've been together for five years.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.880
Well, if you're not coming,
then I have an idea.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.480
But it's men only.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.600
<i> Sex has many faces.</i>

31:29.680 --> 31:31.880
<i>And one of them is paid sex.</i>

31:33.000 --> 31:34.760
<i>You could find every form of it</i>

31:34.840 --> 31:37.440
<i>within a two-kilometer radius</i>
<i>in Amsterdam.</i>

31:38.840 --> 31:41.160
<i>From desperate heroin hookers</i>

31:41.240 --> 31:43.040
<i>behind Centraal Station…</i>

31:44.040 --> 31:47.560
<i>…to live sex theaters</i>
<i>where sloshed tourists paid money…</i>

31:47.640 --> 31:50.280
<i>…to see women shoot ping-pong balls,</i>

31:50.360 --> 31:53.200
<i>to the Netherlands'</i>
<i>most exclusive brothel,</i>

31:53.760 --> 31:54.600
<i>the Yab Yum.</i>

31:54.680 --> 31:55.760
Hey, Johnny.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.960
<i>The living room</i>
<i>of international pop stars,</i>

31:59.040 --> 32:00.880
<i>seasoned criminals,</i>

32:00.960 --> 32:03.480
<i>and successful businessmen.</i>

32:15.440 --> 32:16.760
Johnny boy.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.120
-How's it going?
-It's good.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.480
-You're not alone.
-These are my business partners.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.080
-Ramon and Frank.
-Hello.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.680
-Hello.
-Ronnie.

32:26.760 --> 32:30.280
<i>But it wasn't the girls</i>
<i>who made an impression on Frank.</i>

32:32.360 --> 32:33.520
<i>It was the men.</i>

32:34.040 --> 32:34.920
Cheers.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.160
<i>The criminal defense lawyer,</i>
<i>the banker, the real estate tycoon.</i>

32:39.240 --> 32:42.960
<i>All men with a lot more money</i>
<i>in the bank than he had.</i>

32:44.280 --> 32:47.640
Can you keep a secret?

32:47.720 --> 32:49.960
The Dutch soccer team
has just gone upstairs.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.160
-What?
-No.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.680
With an entire squad,
if you catch my drift.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.120
-The Dutch national team?
-Yes.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.200
Hey, Max. Am I right or not?

32:57.280 --> 32:58.920
They were here just now.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.520
I'd have gotten down on my knees
to thank them.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.760
You better leave that to the girls.

33:04.840 --> 33:08.600
These are the TPs from Teledutch
that I told you about.

33:08.680 --> 33:09.520
TPs?

33:09.600 --> 33:13.120
They started in a garage
with just a few thousand guilders.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.240
-You were the first, right?
-Of course.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.320
What are TPs?

33:16.400 --> 33:22.280
I was approached
by one of your competitors from Rotterdam.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.800
Asking if I want to start a Yab Yum line.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.360
What are TPs?

33:27.520 --> 33:28.880
Telepimps.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.920
That's what everyone calls us.
But think of it as a badge of honor.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.360
Hey. Cut it out, guys.
This is not Club Mazzo.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.720
I think I'll head off soon.

33:46.200 --> 33:49.200
-I'll come with you.
-Shouldn't you wait until Mischa's done?

33:49.960 --> 33:52.600
A night like this,
it'll probably end in a fight.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.480
Come on. Let's go.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.680
I was nearly jealous of her, you know?

34:00.400 --> 34:03.040
The way she lost herself
in that fantasy with Johnny.

34:04.560 --> 34:07.240
The way she just
let go of herself completely.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.680
What do you mean, jealous?

34:10.560 --> 34:11.680
You have that too.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.320
Not like that.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.800
Do you?

34:18.320 --> 34:20.160
Yes. That's not a problem.

34:20.240 --> 34:22.440
It's the one thing
Mischa and I are good at.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.560
Other than that,
he's just a lousy boyfriend.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.200
He only cares about himself.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.120
So do you come every time?

34:34.480 --> 34:36.480
Well, not every time.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.280
He needs some prompts, but on the whole…

34:41.080 --> 34:42.080
What, you don't?

34:43.880 --> 34:44.720
Eh…

34:45.200 --> 34:48.280
-No. Never.
-Never?

34:49.280 --> 34:50.120
No.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.960
-What? Like never?
-No.

34:53.680 --> 34:56.480
-Never ever?
-Yes, well, if I do it…

34:57.000 --> 34:58.720
If I do it myself…

35:00.880 --> 35:02.360
I can't find any info on it.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.280
All those books, all those studies,
they only deal with dicks.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.800
Because they were all written by dicks.

35:09.240 --> 35:12.440
-Couldn't we do our thesis on that?
-What, on dicks? I'd love to.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.960
No, on female arousal.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.680
We can have a maximum
of ten lines coming in per unit.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.800
-Yes, and then we have…
-Julian…

35:20.880 --> 35:23.480
-Could we have another bottle of champers?
-Of course.

35:23.560 --> 35:27.600
And do you have one of those rent boys
around here for our Ronnie over there?

35:27.680 --> 35:30.040
Julian, please explain to him
once and for all.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.680
-Johnny.
-What?

35:31.760 --> 35:34.880
If Ronnie was into men,
I would have noticed by now.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.680
Now you've heard it from someone else.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.520
I have a radar for that kind of thing.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.400
So, as I was saying.
If we connect one unit…

35:44.480 --> 35:47.160
<i>That evening,</i>
<i>Frank could no longer ignore it.</i>

35:47.640 --> 35:50.280
<i>No matter how much money</i>
<i>he and Ramon would make,</i>

35:50.360 --> 35:53.000
<i>no matter how many more successes</i>
<i>they would achieve,</i>

35:53.520 --> 35:56.120
<i>they'd always be those telepimps.</i>

36:21.400 --> 36:22.360
IN THE SAUNA

36:22.440 --> 36:26.320
<i>Thanks to Ramon's approach,</i>
<i>Teledutch stayed ahead of the competition.</i>

36:26.840 --> 36:29.840
<i>The only line that did badly</i>
<i>was the Ladies Only line,</i>

36:29.920 --> 36:31.880
<i>just as I predicted.</i>

36:31.960 --> 36:36.000
<i>But with a slight tweak,</i>
<i>calling in live was a success after all.</i>

36:36.080 --> 36:37.040
We have a caller.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.760
Welcome

36:39.840 --> 36:41.520
to the Men Only line.

36:42.040 --> 36:42.880
And…

36:43.640 --> 36:44.880
who's our lucky boy?

36:44.960 --> 36:46.200
<i>Hi, this is Emiel.</i>

36:47.320 --> 36:48.240
Hi, Emiel.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.160
<i>Frank managed to stay home</i>
<i>the entire two months.</i>

37:01.000 --> 37:03.080
<i>Which gave Anouk enough time to realize</i>

37:03.160 --> 37:06.800
<i>that they weren't well suited</i>
<i>to play parents together.</i>

37:14.200 --> 37:15.240
Good morning.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.720
<i> And suddenly summer was over</i>
<i>and classes resumed.</i>

37:19.640 --> 37:23.200
<i>My favorite professor</i>
<i>returned from his vacation.</i>

37:23.280 --> 37:27.160
Yes, but there's been
very little research on female arousal.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.400
Well, have you read Bolhuis & Kremers?

37:29.480 --> 37:32.480
Yes. But that's a study
of the female orgasm.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.360
I want to know what precedes it.

37:35.960 --> 37:39.240
Do you think there's a difference
between male and female arousal?

37:40.520 --> 37:44.080
Well, men are aroused
much more easily, aren't they?

37:45.080 --> 37:46.480
That is the question.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.840
To be honest,
we know very little about it.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.840
So it would make an excellent subject.

37:53.920 --> 37:54.880
I have a class now.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.440
Er…

37:56.960 --> 37:59.920
If I help you get started
with the research for your thesis,

38:00.520 --> 38:02.440
will you buy me an ice cream tomorrow?

38:04.560 --> 38:05.800
Okay.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.760
<i>Oh yes, something else happened</i>
<i>that first week of September.</i>

38:13.840 --> 38:16.080
Did Mischa say why it's so crowded?

38:18.960 --> 38:20.160
<i>Nobody knew why.</i>

38:20.240 --> 38:23.360
Wait a bit longer.
It's busy inside and there's no space.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.200
-Ladies, come on in.
-Hi.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.680
-Hi, Koos.
-Welcome.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.480
-Okay, wait a minute.
-Hang on.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.600
We've been waiting for ages.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.080
<i>People had returned</i>
<i>from their vacations.</i>

38:34.640 --> 38:37.800
<i>Maybe they'd been</i>
<i>to the clubs in London, or Ibiza.</i>

38:37.880 --> 38:39.160
<i>But suddenly,</i>

38:40.160 --> 38:42.600
<i>it was like everyone finally got it.</i>

38:55.160 --> 38:56.640
…men get aroused more easily…

38:56.720 --> 38:59.080
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>the penny finally dropped</i>

38:59.680 --> 39:02.320
<i>about how female arousal worked.</i>

39:04.240 --> 39:05.080
So,

39:06.400 --> 39:09.280
what you're saying is women
may be physiologically aroused

39:09.360 --> 39:10.840
without being aware of it.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.760
Let's go back to the start.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.400
With this kind of research,
it's best to start with yourself.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.480
So, what turns you on?

39:25.920 --> 39:27.080
Your ice cream's dripping.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.240
Oh.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.600
So?

39:33.320 --> 39:34.240
Do you know?

39:47.320 --> 39:51.080
<i>Actually, the Second Summer of Love</i>
<i>in Amsterdam didn't start in June.</i>

39:51.600 --> 39:53.080
<i>It began in September.</i>

42:30.680 --> 42:34.040
<i> No, it's delicious.</i>

42:34.120 --> 42:35.680
<i>It's so big and fat.</i>

42:35.760 --> 42:37.240
<i>And so beautiful.</i>

42:37.760 --> 42:39.360
<i>Oh, yes. Come on.</i>

42:39.440 --> 42:41.200
<i>It's getting harder. Oh, harder.</i>

42:41.280 --> 42:42.480
<i>Yes. Oh, how lovely.</i>

42:42.560 --> 42:45.560
<i>Yes, come on, lie on top of me.</i>

42:45.640 --> 42:51.280
<i>Grab my breasts, squeeze my nipple.</i>
<i>You're so delicious.</i>

42:51.360 --> 42:53.360
