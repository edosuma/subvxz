00:02.502 --> 00:04.504
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.587 --> 00:06.756
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:07.549 --> 00:09.551
(lively music)

00:11.720 --> 00:12.804
(elephants trumpeting)

00:19.102 --> 00:20.311
MAN: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:22.022
(moans)

00:22.105 --> 00:23.481
(screaming)

00:30.822 --> 00:35.785
NARRATOR: <i>The Walt Disney Company
is represented by many iconic symbols.</i>

00:35.869 --> 00:39.080
<i>Sure, there's Mickey,
there's even Walt himself.</i>

00:39.164 --> 00:42.667
<i>But from the first day of Disneyland
to today,</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:46.671
<i>for every guest
who enters a Disney Park around the globe,</i>

00:46.755 --> 00:50.216
<i>they are greeted by an unmistakable sight.</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:52.427
Ah! There's the beacon
at the end of the tunnel.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.762
I need to go towards that.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.097
NARRATOR:
<i>From Florida's stunning centerpiece...</i>

00:56.181 --> 00:57.557
It's spectacular.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.726
<i>...to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris...</i>

00:59.809 --> 01:01.686
It's ripped from a storybook.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.772
<i>...or Shanghai's mega-castle.</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:04.773
It's a big one.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.150
NARRATOR: <i>And the story
of these modern-day castles</i>

01:07.233 --> 01:08.735
<i>and their master builders...</i>

01:08.818 --> 01:09.778
I design castles.

01:09.861 --> 01:13.615
<i>...all started in Anaheim, California,
in the 1950s,</i>

01:13.698 --> 01:17.160
<i>with the original symbol
of the Walt Disney Parks,</i>

01:17.243 --> 01:20.413
<i>an iconic, majestic...</i>

01:20.497 --> 01:21.748
Weenie.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.958
NARRATOR: <i>Uh... sorry, what?</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:26.169
-A weenie.
-NARRATOR: <i>Oh, that is what you said.</i>

01:26.252 --> 01:28.421
<i>-Hotdogs!
</i><i>-Well, the story is...</i>

01:28.505 --> 01:31.716
Walt's dog,
you would entice it with a weenie.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.386
NARRATOR: <i>As effective as that
would be on dogs, and probably people,</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:37.305
<i>what Walt actually meant was...</i>

01:37.388 --> 01:39.599
It's a weenie that pulls the guest in.

01:39.682 --> 01:40.850
It's like a carrot on a stick.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.561
Gives you a goal
off in the distance to follow.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.813
And it works.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.815
Very interesting.

01:46.898 --> 01:51.653
NARRATOR: <i>However, in the early stages
of developing his Disneyland idea,</i>

01:51.736 --> 01:55.657
<i>Walt wanted something more appropriate
to the content he was creating.</i>

01:55.740 --> 01:58.827
Started with many ideas, threw them away,
started all over again.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.287
NARRATOR: <i>But back then,
it was all about Mickey Mouse.</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:02.831
<i>That's what he was known for.</i>

02:02.914 --> 02:04.457
<i>But instead of a giant mouse,</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:07.001
<i>Walt wanted
to build something even bigger.</i>

02:07.085 --> 02:07.961
A castle.

02:08.044 --> 02:11.965
NARRATOR: <i>Probably makes sense now,
but back then, you might have asked...</i>

02:12.924 --> 02:13.800
Why a castle?

02:13.883 --> 02:18.805
Well, had to do with Walt,
and his love of fairy tales.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.766
I thought so. I thought so.
(laughs)

02:21.850 --> 02:26.396
NARRATOR: <i>But traditional fairy tales
aren't all pixie dust and happy endings.</i>

02:26.479 --> 02:30.150
I mean, if you look at,
you know, some of the Grimm's Fairy Tales,

02:30.233 --> 02:35.029
they're pretty grim,
they had horrible endings to them.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.866
You know, the troll under the bridge
along the river,

02:37.949 --> 02:41.619
kept children from going down
to the edge of the river by themselves.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.206
Or wandering into the forest
and eating berries that were poisoned,

02:45.290 --> 02:47.041
or being attacked by animals.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.377
-(wolf howls)
-NARRATOR: <i>Good night, children.</i>

02:49.502 --> 02:50.920
<i>But before you nod off...</i>

02:51.004 --> 02:51.963
Don't worry.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.840
Walt was the eternal optimist,

02:53.923 --> 02:57.886
and so, he put a very unique twist
onto these stories.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.307
NARRATOR: <i>Beginning with the first ever
feature-length animated film,</i>

03:02.390 --> 03:06.227
<i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs from 1937,</i>

03:06.853 --> 03:09.063
<i>not only did it have a happy ending...</i>

03:09.147 --> 03:12.984
What do you see at that very end
when the prince wakes Snow White up?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.652
DANIEL: <i>It's the castle on the hill.</i>

03:14.736 --> 03:17.405
SNOW WHITE:
<i>He will carry me away to his castle...</i>

03:18.364 --> 03:21.451
<i>where we will live happily ever after.</i>

03:21.534 --> 03:25.079
NARRATOR:
<i>But, much like the gruesome fairy tales,</i>

03:25.163 --> 03:28.583
<i>castles aren't quite as nice
as they seem in the movies.</i>

03:28.666 --> 03:31.252
KING: Lonely in this desolate old palace.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.255
NARRATOR: <i>However, these ominous,
cavernous structures </i>

03:34.339 --> 03:36.925
<i>are not luxurious or princessy.</i>

03:37.008 --> 03:39.552
I've seen a lot of castles in Europe
that are depressing and dark,

03:39.636 --> 03:42.222
-and you don't wanna go anywhere near.
-NARRATOR: <i>But Walt Disney did.</i>

03:42.305 --> 03:44.140
And when he travelled around Europe,
he saw that and thought,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.725
<i>"Hey, that'd be great to have this here."</i>

03:45.808 --> 03:49.979
NARRATOR: <i>A castle didn't need to be
a damp, cold, unhygienic fortress.</i>

03:50.438 --> 03:53.775
So, really, Walt reinterpreted them,
almost reinvented them,

03:53.858 --> 03:55.485
for a contemporary audience.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.946
NARRATOR: <i>And when Walt got serious
about Disneyland...</i>

03:58.029 --> 04:00.823
Which, I hope, will be as good as some
of the things we've done in the past.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.451
NARRATOR: <i>Disney-fying a castle
is exactly what he did.</i>

04:03.534 --> 04:07.080
And Walt really knew who to go to.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.958
Herb Ryman, or Herbie,
as I like to call him.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.127
One of the most amazing Disney artists.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.630
MARTY:
<i>He could convince Herb Ryman to help him,</i>

04:15.713 --> 04:19.300
<i>that it would be a fantastic illustration
of his idea.</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:21.427
And I think Herbie must have thought,

04:21.511 --> 04:23.805
"Uh-oh, Walt's really lost it."
(scoffs)

04:23.888 --> 04:28.351
The first time it appears
is in Herb Ryman's sketch that he did.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.978
NARRATOR: <i>That would be this one.</i>

04:30.061 --> 04:34.732
<i>Sketched in 1953, this drawing
was part of a sales pitch Walt used</i>

04:34.816 --> 04:36.818
<i>to try and finance Disneyland.</i>

04:36.901 --> 04:39.988
That drawing
is probably the most important

04:40.071 --> 04:43.283
and valuable piece of art
in the entire Walt Disney Company.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.618
NARRATOR: <i>Huh. He should have sold it
at the time, then.</i>

04:45.702 --> 04:46.995
<i>Herb Ryman's drawing </i>

04:47.078 --> 04:50.707
<i>began a long association
between Disney and castles.</i>

04:50.790 --> 04:53.293
<i>And to this day,
when you see a Disney logo,</i>

04:53.376 --> 04:56.170
<i>oftentimes, there's a majestic castle
right above it.</i>

04:56.254 --> 04:57.588
A fantasy castle.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.216
NARRATOR: <i>Right, because a real one
would be strange.</i>

05:00.842 --> 05:05.179
<i>But, before we lower the drawbridge
and dunk our toes in the moat,</i>

05:05.263 --> 05:09.475
<i>back in 1954,
Walt Disney had a big decision to make.</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:12.145
<i>That being,
which of his famous movie castles</i>

05:12.228 --> 05:14.022
<i>should he build in the park?</i>

05:14.105 --> 05:17.442
<i>There was</i> Snow White,
Alice in Wonderland...

05:17.525 --> 05:19.485
-Oh!
-<i>...and </i>Cinderella.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.405
It's more than I ever hoped for.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.866
-NARRATOR: <i>But the one he went with was...
</i>-Sleeping Beauty.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.744
-Who did?
-NARRATOR: <i>Walt did. But hang on.</i>

05:27.827 --> 05:32.081
<i>Sleeping Beauty
wasn't due to come out until 1959.</i>

05:32.165 --> 05:35.043
At the time, Walt Disney Pictures
was working on the movie,

05:35.126 --> 05:36.544
so, they built based on that.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.880
NARRATOR: <i>Well, unlike the brothers Grimm,</i>

05:38.963 --> 05:41.799
<i>the brothers Disney
had an ulterior motive.</i>

05:41.883 --> 05:45.636
This is going to be an effective way
to promote his own film.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.679
(singing)
<i>♪ Heigh-ho! ♪</i>

05:46.763 --> 05:49.098
NARRATOR: <i>And so, off to work they went.</i>

05:49.599 --> 05:52.310
<i>Now, bringing the castle
from the fairy tale books</i>

05:52.393 --> 05:54.520
<i>to the movie screen is one thing,</i>

05:54.604 --> 05:59.859
<i>but with only a year to turn this
into a large centerpiece for Disneyland,</i>

05:59.942 --> 06:02.862
<i>there were, putting it mildly, issues.</i>

06:02.945 --> 06:06.240
<i>First and foremost among them,
who was going to build it?</i>

06:06.324 --> 06:10.119
<i>It's not like the California coast
was littered with castles.</i>

06:10.703 --> 06:12.455
<i>Except for those kind.</i>

06:12.538 --> 06:14.290
Nobody ever built
one of these things before,

06:14.374 --> 06:17.794
so, how do you go to somebody and say,
"I need you to build me a castle?"

06:17.877 --> 06:20.505
Well, you know, we...
Who was the last person to build a castle?

06:20.588 --> 06:23.716
NARRATOR: <i>But first, John Hench
and Herb Ryman had to design it,</i>

06:23.800 --> 06:28.012
<i>taking their spade and bucket
into the sandbox of European history.</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:33.684
John and Herbie took pieces off
of Château Chenonceau and Neuschwanstein.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.603
NARRATOR: <i>Well, not actual pieces.</i>

06:35.686 --> 06:38.064
It was inspired by real castles.

06:38.147 --> 06:41.234
NARRATOR: <i>Because building this
on a 160-acre site</i>

06:41.317 --> 06:43.403
<i>doesn't leave much room for anything else.</i>

06:43.486 --> 06:44.570
It was huge.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.364
NARRATOR:
<i>Or, in his brother Roy's words...</i>

06:46.447 --> 06:48.574
"Financially, not practical."

06:48.658 --> 06:50.076
Talking to financial people,

06:50.159 --> 06:52.870
they're not gonna see
Sleeping Beauty Castle.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.331
They're gonna see dollar signs
in their heads.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.874
NARRATOR: <i>And as a result...</i>

06:56.958 --> 07:01.045
We were not able to get the height
of the castle that Walt wanted

07:01.129 --> 07:03.381
because we simply couldn't afford it.

07:03.464 --> 07:08.344
NARRATOR: <i>So, the massive,
mighty castle shrunk. But, not to worry.</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:12.432
<i>Things were quickly looking up, literally,
using a technique called...</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:14.100
-Forced perspective.
-NARRATOR: <i>That's right!</i>

07:14.183 --> 07:15.601
Forced perspective, an old artist's trick

07:15.685 --> 07:18.396
to make things appear larger
or smaller than they actually are.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.524
NARRATOR: <i>Basically, forced perspective
is an optical illusion.</i>

07:21.607 --> 07:23.943
<i>When guests stand
at the base of the structure,</i>

07:24.026 --> 07:25.278
<i>though it looks huge,</i>

07:25.361 --> 07:27.947
<i>it's only the first story
that's full size.</i>

07:28.030 --> 07:33.035
<i>And as the Imagineers build upwards,
every story gets smaller and smaller.</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:34.996
<i>It's a trick Imagineers use a lot.</i>

07:35.079 --> 07:36.247
In Pirates of the Caribbean,

07:36.330 --> 07:41.252
it's used in the burning town,
where you see the street kinda wind up.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.004
So, if you were ever to walk up there,

07:43.087 --> 07:45.339
the little buildings
would be up to your knees.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.925
NARRATOR: <i>So, let's put this
into perspective, as it were.</i>

07:48.009 --> 07:50.511
So, with the castle at the water level,

07:50.595 --> 07:53.014
<i>the stones,
you know, reduce in size as they go up,</i>

07:53.097 --> 07:56.267
<i>so, the windows
drastically gets shorter and shorter.</i>

07:56.350 --> 07:58.936
TOM: <i>But you don't really know
because it makes it look taller.</i>

07:59.020 --> 08:01.689
NARRATOR: <i>So, with the help
of a little movie magic,</i>

08:01.772 --> 08:03.024
<i>they turned it around.</i>

08:03.107 --> 08:05.610
<i>Now, speaking of turning things around...</i>

08:05.693 --> 08:07.403
HERB: <i>It didn't always look like this.</i>

08:07.487 --> 08:11.491
<i>There was a day when the part
facing Fantasyland faced the front.</i>

08:11.574 --> 08:12.700
NARRATOR: <i>What? Like this?</i>

08:12.783 --> 08:15.286
HERB: <i>I came in one day,
and I looked at it, and I thought,</i>

08:15.369 --> 08:18.331
"That looks quite a bit like
the Neuschwanstein Castle

08:18.414 --> 08:21.167
in Mad King Ludwig's Bavaria."

08:21.250 --> 08:25.129
NARRATOR: <i>That's right. Mad King Ludwig.</i>

08:25.213 --> 08:27.590
<i>The story behind this castle
is a great one.</i>

08:27.673 --> 08:30.426
<i>But, you know, murder and insanity
weren't really what they wanted</i>

08:30.510 --> 08:34.263
<i>to base
their Fantasyland showpiece on, so...</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:36.891
I thought I'd experiment with it,
and I turned it around,

08:36.974 --> 08:40.186
and at that moment,
Walt was standing behind me, and he said,

08:40.269 --> 08:45.483
"Oh. I like that a lot better,"
so, that's the way it got built.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.568
NARRATOR:
<i>And now was the time to build it.</i>

08:47.652 --> 08:52.657
<i>And so, storming the castle was a team
of dedicated Californian craftsmen</i>

08:52.740 --> 08:54.408
<i>who were doing... their best?</i>

08:54.492 --> 08:55.493
BILL: <i>There's all the stories</i>

08:55.576 --> 08:57.662
<i>about how one person
will come by and do something,</i>

08:57.745 --> 08:59.747
<i>and right behind him
was the other person undoes it,</i>

08:59.830 --> 09:01.332
<i>'cause it was in the way of their work.</i>

09:01.415 --> 09:03.918
Right down to the wire,
it was a engineering study.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.379
Oh, yeah. It was a madhouse.
It really was.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.549
NARRATOR: <i>So, Walt thought,
why not share these crazy times</i>

09:09.632 --> 09:11.050
<i>with the American public?</i>

09:13.177 --> 09:15.221
<i>The Disneyland television show</i>

09:15.304 --> 09:19.475
where Walt introduces the Disneyland Park
to his television audience.

09:20.142 --> 09:23.229
ANNOUNCER 2:
<i>The Pre-Opening Report from Disneyland.</i>

09:23.312 --> 09:26.566
The opening credits of that,
with Tinker going around, and...

09:26.649 --> 09:30.027
I saw that as a kid.
That became a lasting image.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.863
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Now, your host, Walt Disney.</i>

09:32.947 --> 09:36.242
It's black and white,
it's on small screens,

09:36.325 --> 09:39.453
<i>but it's a way
for people sitting in their homes</i>

09:39.537 --> 09:42.248
<i>to see the castle being built.</i>

09:42.331 --> 09:44.333
They're seeing it come to life.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.711
WALT: <i>We cross the moat
through Sleeping Beauty's Castle,</i>

09:46.794 --> 09:48.504
<i>into the World of Imagination.</i>

09:48.588 --> 09:53.593
NARRATOR: <i>Walt's TV show had worked.
And on opening day in July of 1955...</i>

09:53.676 --> 09:55.720
It seems like all of California was there.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.263
NARRATOR: <i>Not all of California,</i>

09:57.346 --> 09:59.974
<i>but more than half
of the American population</i>

10:00.057 --> 10:02.893
<i>-watched a live broadcast...</i>
-(twinkling)

10:02.977 --> 10:06.439
<i>...as the castle drawbridge
was lowered for the first time.</i>

10:06.522 --> 10:09.442
They had invited
about a hundred local kids

10:09.525 --> 10:11.611
to be the first kids to run across.

10:11.694 --> 10:15.114
ANNOUNCER 3: <i>Open the Fantasyland Castle!</i>

10:15.197 --> 10:16.365
TIM O'DAY: <i>Well, word got out.</i>

10:16.449 --> 10:18.618
<i>So now, the characters,
they're expecting a hundred kids,</i>

10:18.701 --> 10:24.040
500 kids are now running at them,
and they're all fleeing across the moat.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.627
It is organized chaos, at best.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.587
NARRATOR: <i>Fleeing cast members aside,</i>

10:29.670 --> 10:32.715
<i>Walt had indeed created
a majestic centerpiece,</i>

10:32.798 --> 10:34.550
<i>drawing you inside the park.</i>

10:34.634 --> 10:37.553
I remember sitting at the top
of Main Street, looking down, and saying,

10:37.637 --> 10:38.971
"I just want to run through that castle

10:39.055 --> 10:40.598
and see what's on the other side
of the drawbridge."

10:40.681 --> 10:42.600
JEANETTE: <i>"What is behind the other side
of the drawbridge?"</i>

10:42.683 --> 10:43.934
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, not so fast.</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:49.940
<i>Because two years after Disneyland opened,
a new attraction welcomed park guests,</i>

10:50.024 --> 10:53.986
<i>not to the other side of the castle,
but up within it.</i>

10:54.528 --> 10:58.199
<i>Eager to promote
the then in-production Sleeping Beauty,</i>

10:58.282 --> 11:00.701
<i>Walt called
upon the film's production designer,</i>

11:00.785 --> 11:01.786
<i>Eyvind Earle.</i>

11:01.869 --> 11:05.915
Walt asked him
if he would help him create a little place

11:05.998 --> 11:08.000
<i>where you could walk up inside the castle</i>

11:08.084 --> 11:12.296
and actually see the story
of Sleeping Beauty in little flats.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.799
NARRATOR:
<i>These little two-dimensional dioramas</i>

11:14.882 --> 11:19.512
<i>featured not only hand-painted
Eyvind Earle artwork, but also...</i>

11:19.595 --> 11:20.638
Really fun effects.

11:20.721 --> 11:24.350
Very simple special effects,
but they were very effective.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.770
NARRATOR: <i>Effective enough
that even after a redesign,</i>

11:27.853 --> 11:29.397
<i>a seven-year closure,</i>

11:29.480 --> 11:33.442
<i>and then, another redesign
resulting in its current state,</i>

11:33.526 --> 11:35.695
<i>the Sleeping Beauty Castle Walkthrough</i>

11:35.778 --> 11:40.950
<i>has kept park guests wandering
these mysterious halls for generations.</i>

11:41.033 --> 11:42.743
<i>And that's no small feat,</i>

11:42.827 --> 11:46.664
<i>although the same can't exactly be said
for the castle housing it.</i>

11:46.747 --> 11:50.626
People are still surprised
to hear that it's only 70 feet tall.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.627
-No.
-Yes!

11:51.711 --> 11:54.505
NARRATOR: <i>No, 77 feet, to be exact.</i>

11:54.588 --> 11:57.758
<i>And thanks
to some very imaginative Imagineers</i>

11:57.842 --> 11:59.385
<i>and forced perspective,</i>

11:59.468 --> 12:02.888
<i>Disneyland and the castle
were a massive success.</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:04.390
<i>And as a result, </i>

12:04.473 --> 12:08.352
<i>it wasn't long before issues of size
were back on Walt's mind.</i>

12:08.436 --> 12:13.107
ANNOUNCER 4: <i>Forty-three square miles of
tangled scrub and almost impassable swamp.</i>

12:13.190 --> 12:17.319
NARRATOR: <i>Or otherwise known as Florida
in the 1960s.</i>

12:17.403 --> 12:19.697
ANNOUNCER 4:
<i>Most of it was considered undevelopable.</i>

12:19.780 --> 12:21.699
NARRATOR: <i>But not by the brothers Disney,</i>

12:21.782 --> 12:24.702
<i>because there were no boundaries
to Walt's vision,</i>

12:24.785 --> 12:29.540
<i>and no limits to the size and cost
of this mighty new Florida project.</i>

12:29.623 --> 12:31.375
Well, my big brother says we can do it.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.252
He's the money man.
(laughs)

12:33.335 --> 12:36.255
NARRATOR: <i>And when it came time
to pick a centerpiece for Disneyworld,</i>

12:36.338 --> 12:38.507
<i>well, of course, it would be...</i>

12:39.175 --> 12:40.593
-A castle.
-NARRATOR: <i>But this time...</i>

12:40.676 --> 12:42.136
But it's a very different castle.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.847
NARRATOR: <i>Well, with an area
much bigger than Disneyland,</i>

12:44.930 --> 12:47.349
<i>it goes without saying
that they'd need a...</i>

12:47.433 --> 12:49.685
Much, much, much larger castle.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.104
Good heavens, child.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.775
NARRATOR: <i>But bigger isn't always better,
as the designers soon discovered.</i>

12:55.858 --> 12:57.610
Boy, that's tough to work around.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.403
Because now,
you have visual intrusion issues

12:59.487 --> 13:01.655
from all over the park, where I'll be
in the middle of Tomorrowland,

13:01.739 --> 13:03.282
but I'll see a castle in the background.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.575
That's sort of jarring.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.953
Whereas at Disneyland, I'm in Tomorrowland
I don't see a castle in the background.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.623
-NARRATOR: <i>So, the question was asked...</i>
-Why have a castle so large?

13:10.706 --> 13:14.084
It doesn't need to be that large.
Or does it?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.629
NARRATOR: <i>Of course it needs to be huge,
and here's why.</i>

13:16.712 --> 13:20.591
DAVE: <i>We've got this big lagoon
in front of the Magic Kingdom,</i>

13:20.674 --> 13:22.676
and you're parking way over here.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.471
You don't even get to see the park yet.

13:26.096 --> 13:29.058
If we had a Disneyland-sized castle,
you'd never see the castle.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.893
Oh, that does make a difference.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.854
NARRATOR: <i>Well, Walt Disney himself
never saw the castle,</i>

13:33.938 --> 13:37.566
<i>and its completion was left
to Walt's older brother, Roy.</i>

13:37.650 --> 13:40.611
<i>and he used the same formula
that had worked so well</i>

13:40.694 --> 13:42.530
<i>for the brothers back in California,</i>

13:42.613 --> 13:45.991
<i>basing the park
around a fantastical central castle.</i>

13:46.075 --> 13:47.284
<i>And, of course, don't forget...</i>

13:47.368 --> 13:50.204
He was gonna continually take the movies
that he was making,

13:50.287 --> 13:51.622
and use them to sell the park.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.625
While the park was selling the movies,
the movies were selling the park.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.752
It was a very symbiotic relationship.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.380
NARRATOR: <i>So, what would this castle be?</i>

13:59.964 --> 14:01.757
Uh, won't you tell us all about it?

14:01.841 --> 14:05.427
NARRATOR: <i>Because everyone knows
castles belong to princesses.</i>

14:05.511 --> 14:08.389
<i>So, considering the time crunch
they were under,</i>

14:08.472 --> 14:10.850
<i>-Cinderella seemed perfectly appropriate.</i>
-(clock dinging)

14:10.933 --> 14:13.769
<i>And as they frantically worked
to get Disney World built</i>

14:13.853 --> 14:17.398
<i>by the stroke of midnight
of September 30th, 1971,</i>

14:17.481 --> 14:22.278
<i>Imagineers, Marty Sklar,
and now-castle aficionado Herb Ryman,</i>

14:22.361 --> 14:23.487
<i>sprang into action.</i>

14:23.571 --> 14:28.450
When we first went to Walt Disney World,
October 1967,

14:28.534 --> 14:30.160
<i>we had cleared a hundred acres.</i>

14:30.244 --> 14:34.039
And we put a big yellow X
where we were gonna build the castle.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.417
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, X didn't mark the spot for long.</i>

14:36.500 --> 14:39.169
<i>Because after about 18 months
of construction,</i>

14:39.253 --> 14:42.298
<i>Walt Disney's dream castle was complete.</i>

14:42.381 --> 14:45.092
<i>And the crowning jewel
of the new Walt Disney World</i>

14:45.175 --> 14:46.886
<i>was without rival.</i>

14:46.969 --> 14:49.680
The Magic Kingdom Castle is spectacular.

14:50.264 --> 14:54.226
It's always exciting to see people
when they see it for the first time,

14:54.310 --> 14:56.770
<i>stand there in awe of this spire</i>

14:56.854 --> 15:00.024
<i>that just goes right straight on up
seemingly forever.</i>

15:00.107 --> 15:03.027
NARRATOR: <i>And this time,
it's not even the forced perspective,</i>

15:03.110 --> 15:05.863
<i>because Cinderella Castle
at Walt Disney World </i>

15:05.946 --> 15:09.033
<i>stands at a whopping 189 feet.</i>

15:09.116 --> 15:13.203
<i>And inside of this iconic castle,
there's a secret room.</i>

15:15.664 --> 15:21.003
<i>It's the exclusive,
invitation-only Cinderella Castle Suite,</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:22.671
<i>a dwelling fit for royalty,</i>

15:22.755 --> 15:25.132
<i>that, of course,
comes with crown, gown, and slippers.</i>

15:25.215 --> 15:28.302
<i>But long before the Cinderella Suite
was up and running,</i>

15:28.385 --> 15:30.846
<i>guests were completely stunned
by the castle</i>

15:30.930 --> 15:32.973
<i>in much the same way they were in Anaheim.</i>

15:33.057 --> 15:35.434
Ah! There's the beacon
at the end of the tunnel.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.810
I need to go towards that.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.938
NARRATOR: <i>And people did, by the millions.</i>

15:39.104 --> 15:43.943
<i>And now, with this glorious structure
piercing the Florida skyline,</i>

15:44.026 --> 15:47.154
<i>the question was, "Well, what now?"</i>

15:47.237 --> 15:51.075
<i>Because here's the thing.
Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom Park,</i>

15:51.158 --> 15:55.663
<i>helmed by their castles,
had become a worldwide fascination.</i>

15:56.246 --> 16:01.669
<i>Especially so, amongst those hailing
from the Land of the Rising Sun itself.</i>

16:01.752 --> 16:03.212
<i>This is Japan.</i>

16:03.295 --> 16:08.425
<i>In the late '70s, a cultural sensation
and a business behemoth.</i>

16:08.509 --> 16:11.804
Disney, we were approached
by Oriental Land Company from Japan.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.224
WING: <i>They said, "Well, we have
this piece of land in Tokyo Bay.</i>

16:15.307 --> 16:18.352
Would you, Disney, be interested
and do a park there?"

16:18.435 --> 16:19.395
NARRATOR: <i>Would they?</i>

16:19.478 --> 16:21.397
<i>But what kind of castle
would be right for Japan?</i>

16:21.480 --> 16:25.359
They wanted, really, an exact duplicate
of the Walt Disney World castle.

16:25.442 --> 16:30.239
So, the Imagineers, they said,
"We're gonna just take

16:30.322 --> 16:33.826
the Magic Kingdom castle
and put it in Tokyo."

16:33.909 --> 16:35.953
Why, that means I can go, too.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.414
NARRATOR:
<i>Yes, Cinderella, you can go to the ball.</i>

16:38.497 --> 16:41.458
<i>Even though so many designs
already existed,</i>

16:41.542 --> 16:44.753
<i>it didn't mean Imagineers could...
sleep on the job.</i>

16:44.837 --> 16:46.714
<i>Because while they were providing</i>

16:46.797 --> 16:49.258
<i>the creative design
for Tokyo Disneyland...</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:51.218
The company was also building Epcot.

16:51.301 --> 16:55.097
Experimental Prototype Community
Of Tomorrow.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.890
NARRATOR: <i>Yep, there's nothing easy</i>

16:56.974 --> 16:59.893
<i>about building the world's
most advanced geosphere.</i>

16:59.977 --> 17:02.604
<i>And, as a result
of this enormous project...</i>

17:02.688 --> 17:04.857
There was a huge team on Epcot,

17:04.940 --> 17:07.276
<i>and a very small team
for Tokyo Disneyland,</i>

17:07.359 --> 17:09.987
because they just didn't have the people.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.239
Tokyo was this, like,
little project that could.

17:12.322 --> 17:15.159
And you could tell that...
this was difficult.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.243
NARRATOR: <i>Because...</i>

17:16.326 --> 17:19.830
They only had two and a half years
to build this park.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.665
NARRATOR: <i>Seems pretty tight.</i>

17:21.749 --> 17:26.045
They had to just take what they knew,
and get it done.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.796
NARRATOR: <i>Easier said than done.</i>

17:27.880 --> 17:32.301
Trying to explain to a contractor in Japan
who's never even been to a theme park,

17:32.384 --> 17:33.677
<i>that was the challenge.</i>

17:33.761 --> 17:35.888
BOB: <i>They didn't speak English,
I didn't speak Japanese.</i>

17:35.971 --> 17:37.931
But we could sketch.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.350
And sketching
is this international language

17:40.434 --> 17:42.686
where you can tell when somebody gets it.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.439
NARRATOR:
<i>Using the ancient art of... Pictionary,</i>

17:45.522 --> 17:48.525
<i>the American Imagineers
and their Japanese counterparts</i>

17:48.609 --> 17:51.945
<i>brought the Tokyo castle
and surrounding park to fruition.</i>

17:52.029 --> 17:55.949
<i>And in April 1983,
when Tokyo Disneyland opened,</i>

17:56.033 --> 17:57.785
<i>of course, it was a huge success.</i>

17:57.868 --> 18:01.747
<i>And it proved that the Disney castles
and parks they represented</i>

18:01.830 --> 18:03.957
<i>could work in other countries, too. </i>

18:04.166 --> 18:07.336
<i>So much so that soon
after touching down in Anaheim...</i>

18:07.419 --> 18:10.589
They were... had started talking
about doing a Disneyland in Europe.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.049
NARRATOR: <i>And, more specifically...</i>

18:12.132 --> 18:13.801
<i>-Bonjour!
-Bonjour!</i>

18:13.884 --> 18:14.718
<i>-Bonjour!
-Bonjour!</i>

18:14.802 --> 18:16.470
<i>-Bonjour!</i>
-NARRATOR: <i>France!</i>

18:16.553 --> 18:19.181
Welcome to Walt Disney Company.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.432
NARRATOR: <i>And very soon...</i>

18:20.516 --> 18:24.436
Everybody in the world knew that Disney
was building a park in France.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.687
I mean, that was huge news.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.772
NARRATOR: <i>But this time,</i>

18:26.855 --> 18:29.900
<i>it wasn't the French paparazzi
making life difficult.</i>

18:29.983 --> 18:32.986
The hardest part
about designing a castle for France,

18:33.070 --> 18:36.949
is that France
is the castle capital of the world.

18:37.032 --> 18:40.953
NARRATOR: <i>And if by that, you mean
that there are a lot of castles in France,</i>

18:41.036 --> 18:42.412
<i>then, you're right.</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:46.041
<i>There are approximately 450 ca... Oh!</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:48.669
<i>Four thousand five hu... What?</i>

18:48.752 --> 18:51.922
<i>Forty-five thousand castles in France.</i>

18:52.005 --> 18:57.344
<i>And now, it would be 45,001.
How would this one stand out?</i>

18:57.427 --> 19:00.347
-The one in France had to be...
-NARRATOR: <i>Superb? Exquisite?</i>

19:00.430 --> 19:03.559
Fantastically fantastic.
And really be more of a dream.

19:03.642 --> 19:07.020
You know, a dreamlike castle,
like something you would see in a film,

19:07.104 --> 19:08.438
<i>or read in a storybook.</i>

19:08.522 --> 19:10.482
NARRATOR:
<i>But when it comes to French storybooks,</i>

19:10.566 --> 19:11.817
<i>really, take your pick.</i>

19:11.900 --> 19:15.362
I think there was kind of a predisposition
to make it Cinderella,

19:15.445 --> 19:18.574
'cause she's French also,
and it's simple to say.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.827
-ANASTASIA: Cinderella!
-All right, I'm coming.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.288
TOM:
<i>But the Sleeping Beauty Castle, in French,</i>

19:24.371 --> 19:27.207
Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant
<i>was a mouthful,</i>

19:27.291 --> 19:30.210
<i>and so, even though
we were styling it after Sleeping Beauty,</i>

19:30.294 --> 19:32.629
we thought, "Well, maybe we'll make it
Cinderella's Castle."

19:32.713 --> 19:34.464
NARRATOR: <i>But still,
with a general direction,</i>

19:34.548 --> 19:37.843
<i>the Imagineers proceeded...
somewhat cautiously.</i>

19:37.926 --> 19:41.054
The idea for it was to be very soft
and weathered a little bit,

19:41.138 --> 19:42.222
and not so sharp.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.224
And almost kind of the kind of castle

19:44.308 --> 19:46.768
that you'd find in an aquarium
or a fishbowl.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.022
Someone took that literally,
and that got misinterpreted

19:50.105 --> 19:53.192
<i>to literally mean
looking like a little, tiny castle.</i>

19:53.275 --> 19:56.945
You know, with one window and a door,
and, you know, one or two towers.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.616
And I said,
"Why don't you let me take a stab at it?"

20:00.699 --> 20:04.536
NARRATOR: <i>And so, Tom began working out
the basic thrust of his idea.</i>

20:04.620 --> 20:07.998
So, the main thing that I was going for
was Eyvind Earle.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.667
NARRATOR: <i>Eyvind Earle
being the legendary artist</i>

20:10.751 --> 20:12.711
<i>behind the Sleeping Beauty movie,</i>

20:12.794 --> 20:16.798
<i>and don't forget that cool walk-through,
and Tom found inspiration in...</i>

20:16.882 --> 20:21.595
The forests, the trees, the glades,
the little hills and everything.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.806
Eyvind Earle
had a very Cubist-type expression

20:24.890 --> 20:26.391
to his landscape design.

20:26.475 --> 20:30.145
NARRATOR: <i>So Cubist, in fact, that...
Well, look at that tree.</i>

20:30.229 --> 20:33.607
And so, the trees are sculpted
to match that.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.318
NARRATOR: <i>So, thinking outside
the box-shaped tree...</i>

20:36.401 --> 20:39.029
I looked up all of the castles
from the Disney films.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.739
TOM: <i>What's cool about this one?</i>

20:40.822 --> 20:45.661
This one has a spiral staircase.
This one has really cozy little niches.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.538
<i>And we have some French consultants.</i>

20:48.622 --> 20:52.084
<i>One of them took me on a tour
of the castles in the Loire Valley.</i>

20:52.167 --> 20:56.296
NARRATOR: <i>This region, south of Paris,
is oozing with Frenchness.</i>

20:56.380 --> 21:00.342
<i>Castles, châteaus,
and some of the oldest wineries in France.</i>

21:00.425 --> 21:04.346
<i>But most importantly for Tom,
it was filled with inspiration.</i>

21:04.429 --> 21:08.976
Ideas like the Château Chambord
had a tower in the center

21:09.059 --> 21:10.644
<i>that was a stained-glass tower,</i>

21:10.727 --> 21:14.022
and whenever the king was in town,
they'd light up that tower.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.440
TOM: <i>And so, we incorporated that.</i>

21:15.524 --> 21:18.819
NARRATOR: <i>And it was these little details
that made the difference.</i>

21:18.902 --> 21:22.906
You know, Tom's diligence on the castle
was really quite extraordinary to me.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.324
TIM: <i>You know, I love the design of it.</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:28.870
<i>I love the fact that it looks like
it's been ripped from a storybook page.</i>

21:28.954 --> 21:30.914
NARRATOR: <i>Ripping the best bits from...</i>

21:30.998 --> 21:32.708
The authentic castles
that are just down the road.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.045
NARRATOR: <i>Tom had created
a fantastic and huge castle called...</i>

21:37.129 --> 21:39.131
<i>Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant.</i>

21:39.214 --> 21:40.590
NARRATOR: <i>Which literally translates</i>

21:40.674 --> 21:43.635
<i>to The Castle of the Beauty
in the Sleeping Woods.</i>

21:43.719 --> 21:46.638
<i>Cinderella's French.
Why didn't they just go with that? </i>

21:46.722 --> 21:48.515
We got French feedback that was,

21:48.598 --> 21:51.435
"We love
<i>Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant.</i>

21:51.518 --> 21:54.604
We love that. It's poetic."
So, that settled it.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.606
You know, once we heard
that they like that name,

21:56.690 --> 21:59.151
<i>all I'm thinking about
is the graphics on it.</i>

21:59.234 --> 22:01.194
Like, "Can we fit all that on?"
(laughs)

22:01.778 --> 22:04.573
NARRATOR: <i>As construction loomed,
what was once a problem...</i>

22:04.656 --> 22:06.658
The authentic castles
that are just down the road.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.785
<i>...now became their greatest asset.</i>

22:08.869 --> 22:14.249
It really helps if you've got
fine craftspeople down the road.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.669
TRACY: <i>One of these
master stained-glass window makers</i>

22:17.753 --> 22:18.795
<i>came out of retirement.</i>

22:18.879 --> 22:20.964
NARRATOR:
<i>Having worked on Notre Dame and...</i>

22:21.048 --> 22:24.009
TRACY: <i>With the Royal Family,
and Westminster Abbey,</i>

22:24.092 --> 22:25.093
<i>all sorts of places.</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:28.513
NARRATOR: <i>In his eighties, Paul Chapman
was totally up for the challenge.</i>

22:28.597 --> 22:33.352
The first time he saw the drawings
for the stained-glass, he was so excited

22:33.435 --> 22:36.897
because it was the first time
he got to tell a fairy-tale story

22:36.980 --> 22:38.148
with stained-glass.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.524
It was a first for him.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.651
The other thing
was that you can explore it

22:41.735 --> 22:43.779
like you do castles in Europe.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.490
You know, you don't just visit
a castle for ten minutes.

22:46.573 --> 22:50.452
You needed to let people go upstairs.
You know, that's just a thing in Europe.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.705
And as an additional nod
to the French culture,

22:53.789 --> 22:56.541
<i>there's a turret on Sleeping Beauty Castle</i>

22:56.625 --> 22:59.586
<i>that has this beautiful
little architectural ornamentation</i>

22:59.669 --> 23:02.964
<i>that runs all the way up it,
and if you get up close,</i>

23:03.048 --> 23:07.386
you'll see that each of the little nodules
are actually escargot shells.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.765
NARRATOR: <i>But this grisly depiction
of devoured snail carcasses is nothing</i>

23:11.848 --> 23:14.226
<i>compared to what's in the dungeon.</i>

23:14.309 --> 23:18.563
You walk in, and there's the dragon
in this pool of water.

23:18.647 --> 23:23.777
And the dragon is usually sleeping,
but dragons sleep lightly.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.696
(roars)

23:26.780 --> 23:29.950
And he looks around, and everyone goes...
(gasping)

23:30.075 --> 23:31.785
(growling)

23:32.369 --> 23:34.996
NARRATOR: <i>But the crowning jewel
of this majestic castle</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:38.417
<i>is at the opposite end from the dungeon,
right up here on top.</i>

23:38.500 --> 23:41.461
<i>And installing that was a sight to behold.</i>

23:41.545 --> 23:45.590
They had to bring in, like,
a 91-meter crane to get it up there.

23:45.674 --> 23:50.846
TRACY: <i>And we stood there watching,
and it floated into place.</i>

23:50.929 --> 23:53.223
(scoffs)
We cheered. It was like,

23:53.306 --> 23:56.059
"Okay.
This is real, and this is happening."

23:56.143 --> 24:00.105
NARRATOR: <i>And the happening continued
until April 12th, 1992,</i>

24:00.188 --> 24:03.984
<i>when what was then
Euro Disneyland was officially opened.</i>

24:04.067 --> 24:05.318
-(fireworks crackles)
-(people cheer)

24:05.402 --> 24:08.572
NARRATOR: <i>Thanks to Tom Morris'
side hustle, to this day,</i>

24:08.655 --> 24:13.702
<i>Disneyland Paris boasts, perhaps,
the world's most enchanting castle.</i>

24:13.785 --> 24:16.371
I think that it's the best of all castles.
I hope I don't offend anyone.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.707
(gasping)

24:18.790 --> 24:22.461
NARRATOR: <i>By the mid '90s, the world
was well-serviced by Disney Parks</i>

24:22.544 --> 24:27.007
<i>in all four corners of the globe,
and that's the way it stayed for a decade.</i>

24:27.090 --> 24:29.676
<i>But then,
something groundbreaking happened.</i>

24:29.759 --> 24:32.179
The groundbreaking
of Hong Kong Disneyland.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.431
NARRATOR: <i>That's right,
the Imagineers were back at it,</i>

24:34.514 --> 24:38.059
<i>ready to take Hong Kong Disneyland's
castle to the next level,</i>

24:38.143 --> 24:42.481
<i>now armed with a shovel-load
of international experience.</i>

24:42.564 --> 24:45.650
<i>But when it came time
to build their next masterpiece,</i>

24:45.734 --> 24:49.779
<i>some familiar words
wafted through the thick Hong Kong air.</i>

24:49.863 --> 24:53.074
They wanted really an exact duplicate
of the Walt Disney World castle.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.577
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, yeah.
Hong Kong wanted the big one, too.</i>

24:55.660 --> 24:59.623
No. It was actually a replica of Anaheim.

24:59.706 --> 25:03.668
NARRATOR: <i>All 77 feet
of the castle that started it all.</i>

25:03.752 --> 25:06.087
<i>Gee, it is small
compared to the other ones.</i>

25:06.171 --> 25:07.547
<i>Oh, yeah. That's better.</i>

25:07.631 --> 25:10.800
<i>But in any case, building this one
wasn't a walk in the park.</i>

25:10.884 --> 25:15.472
Because, culturally,
Hong Kong was different.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.890
NARRATOR: <i>Oh? Different how?</i>

25:16.973 --> 25:19.935
DORIS: <i>Being born in Hong Kong,
my family's from Shanghai,</i>

25:20.018 --> 25:23.730
so, I understand
some of the nuances, culturally.

25:23.813 --> 25:24.648
NARRATOR: <i>Such as?</i>

25:24.731 --> 25:27.567
How we laid out that park
is extremely important

25:27.651 --> 25:30.111
<i>to the prosperity and the happiness,</i>

25:30.195 --> 25:34.783
and all of those elements that go
with the Chinese belief in feng shui.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.410
NARRATOR: <i>Feng shui,
being a traditional practice</i>

25:37.494 --> 25:39.496
<i>that originated in Ancient China,</i>

25:39.579 --> 25:44.501
<i>brings harmony by carefully arranging
the energy forces in your surroundings.</i>

25:44.584 --> 25:47.337
It just makes you more balanced.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.382
NARRATOR: <i>But how is that relevant
to Disneyland and the castle?</i>

25:50.465 --> 25:53.134
Basically, you need ocean in the front,
or water,

25:53.218 --> 25:55.720
and mountains in the back
for power or strength.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.973
-NARRATOR: <i>Does Space Mountain count?</i>
-(screams)

25:58.056 --> 26:02.561
No. They've worked with a feng shui master
and made sure that the Hong Kong park

26:02.644 --> 26:05.146
was orientated in a fashion that worked.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.858
NARRATOR: <i>And with balance and harmony,
things can come full circle.</i>

26:08.942 --> 26:12.279
<i>And that's exactly what happened here,
because most of the other castles are...</i>

26:12.362 --> 26:15.532
Facing physically south,
because for your photo taking,

26:15.615 --> 26:16.992
<i>it's always perfect.</i>

26:17.075 --> 26:19.911
<i>It's always in the sunlight.
It's never in the shade.</i>

26:19.995 --> 26:22.706
NARRATOR: <i>But in Hong Kong,
facing south would mean this...</i>

26:22.789 --> 26:25.125
<i>Which is not good for feng shui.</i>

26:25.208 --> 26:27.919
<i>For that mountain backdrop,
this castle would need to be...</i>

26:28.003 --> 26:29.212
Facing east.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.090
NARRATOR: <i>So, just like Herb Ryman did
to the original castle...</i>

26:32.173 --> 26:34.175
-Then, I turned it around...
-NARRATOR: <i>And now...</i>

26:34.259 --> 26:36.928
LUC: <i>It stands out just right
above the mountains behind,</i>

26:37.012 --> 26:38.597
so, the whole composition's different.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.848
<i>It makes beautiful pictures.</i>

26:39.931 --> 26:41.600
NARRATOR: <i>Channeling energy is one thing,</i>

26:41.683 --> 26:46.896
<i>but for Tom Morris and the team,
they also had to channel something else.</i>

26:46.980 --> 26:49.107
The rain is prolific here in Hong Kong.

26:49.190 --> 26:52.569
We get more in a day or two in Hong Kong
than we get all year in California.

26:52.652 --> 26:53.570
(thunder rumbles)

26:53.653 --> 26:56.031
NARRATOR: <i>Scurrying from the rain
and against the clock,</i>

26:56.114 --> 26:59.951
<i>Hong Kong Disneyland
opened September 12th, 2005.</i>

27:00.577 --> 27:05.498
<i>The near-identical castle to Anaheim
sat amidst a vastly different backdrop,</i>

27:05.582 --> 27:09.294
<i>framed against the horizon,
like no Disney castle on Earth.</i>

27:09.377 --> 27:10.420
You will enjoy it.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.839
NARRATOR:
<i>And everyone was happy and balanced.</i>

27:12.922 --> 27:15.300
-(chants)
-NARRATOR: <i>For now, at least.</i>

27:15.383 --> 27:20.430
<i>But in 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger
stood in front of the world...</i>

27:20.513 --> 27:22.641
Thank you very much.
<i>Ni hao</i> and good morning.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.060
<i>...with some very exciting news.</i>

27:25.143 --> 27:29.856
It is my great pleasure to welcome you
to Shanghai Disney Resort.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.733
NARRATOR: <i>Yep. They were at it again!</i>

27:31.816 --> 27:34.861
<i>But this time,
with a Disney Park for Mainland China.</i>

27:34.944 --> 27:37.113
<i>You know, with over a billion people.</i>

27:37.447 --> 27:39.199
<i>Well, at least
they had done their homework.</i>

27:39.282 --> 27:43.078
<i>Thanks to Hong Kong Disneyland,
they had already mastered the nuance</i>

27:43.161 --> 27:45.413
<i>of creating a theme park
for the Chinese market.</i>

27:45.497 --> 27:47.248
<i>So, logically, the plan was...</i>

27:47.332 --> 27:48.541
Take the drawings
from Hong Kong Disneyland,

27:48.625 --> 27:50.627
spread them out a little bit,
make it a little bit bigger.

27:50.710 --> 27:54.214
NARRATOR: <i>Come on, nothing's that easy.
Dusting off his backpack...</i>

27:54.297 --> 27:56.341
I took my first research trip to China.

27:56.424 --> 27:59.636
NARRATOR: <i>Bob quickly realized
that simply doing a beefed-up version</i>

27:59.719 --> 28:03.431
<i>of what they had done in Hong Kong,
well, that just wasn't gonna work.</i>

28:03.515 --> 28:04.974
<i>Time to tell the boss.</i>

28:05.058 --> 28:07.602
I came back,
and I got in front of Bob Iger,

28:08.019 --> 28:12.273
and I said, "I hope you're okay.
I must tell you this.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.944
I don't think we should do Main Street.
I don't think we should do Frontierland.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.613
I don't think the castle should be
a copy of the one in Hong Kong."

28:18.697 --> 28:21.741
It was a pretty big list.
And Bob Iger said,

28:22.701 --> 28:23.702
"You're exactly right."

28:23.785 --> 28:25.662
NARRATOR: <i>So, the new mandate became...</i>

28:25.745 --> 28:27.539
It has to be innovative.
It has to be relevant.

28:27.622 --> 28:28.873
NARRATOR: <i>And above all else...</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:31.751
We need to respect
the fact that we're in China.

28:31.835 --> 28:32.711
I won't let you down.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.337
NARRATOR:
<i>So, as the focus turned to creating</i>

28:34.421 --> 28:35.839
<i>an entirely new experience</i>

28:35.922 --> 28:37.674
<i>for the biggest population on Earth,</i>

28:37.757 --> 28:41.594
<i>Bob turned his attention
to the thing that would represent it.</i>

28:41.678 --> 28:44.556
This castle was such
an important symbol to everyone.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.267
NARRATOR: <i>"Everyone" being more than
a billion people, so...</i>

28:47.350 --> 28:49.352
-It should be big.
-NARRATOR: <i>Maybe bigger than big.</i>

28:49.436 --> 28:51.187
They want it
to be the largest Disney castle

28:51.271 --> 28:52.647
that they've ever built.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.733
-It should be big. This is China.
-NARRATOR: <i>Exactly.</i>

28:54.816 --> 28:57.485
<i>And they're known
for making great, big things.</i>

28:57.569 --> 28:59.738
-They didn't want another Great Wall.
-NARRATOR: <i>Right.</i>

28:59.821 --> 29:01.865
They wanted something
that felt more like a home.

29:01.948 --> 29:05.660
NARRATOR: <i>But it's a castle.
And, well, we've been through this.</i>

29:05.744 --> 29:07.662
I've seen a lot of castles
that are depressing and dark.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.916
NARRATOR: <i>So, how do you make
a gigantic castle a warm and comfy house?</i>

29:12.000 --> 29:15.545
Ah, is it height?
Is it width? Is it depth?

29:15.628 --> 29:19.174
NARRATOR: <i>Well, Executive Creative
Director, Doris Woodward reached out</i>

29:19.257 --> 29:22.510
<i>to Disney's most qualified castle experts
to find out.</i>

29:22.594 --> 29:28.349
I decided to do a sort of all-calling help
to get different folks to come in

29:28.433 --> 29:31.352
from all of our different divisions,
creatively.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.979
-Are you serious?
-Yes!

29:33.062 --> 29:35.064
NARRATOR:
<i>She was, and really wanted to know...</i>

29:35.148 --> 29:38.568
What did they think
the castle should look like in Shanghai?

29:38.651 --> 29:40.487
NARRATOR: <i>A lovely, inclusive notion.</i>

29:40.570 --> 29:45.742
I received, literally, napkin sketches
from very, very well-known designers.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.535
NARRATOR: <i>And the napkins kept coming.</i>

29:47.619 --> 29:50.079
Doug Rogers had just joined Imagineering.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.457
My name's Douglas Rogers, and previously,

29:52.540 --> 29:57.045
I was a production designer
for Walt Disney Feature Animation.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.505
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, animation.</i>

29:58.588 --> 30:01.966
He was the production designer
for the movie Tangled.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.385
NARRATOR: <i>But Doug
was no hairstylist. He...</i>

30:04.469 --> 30:06.888
Had done the design
for the castle on Tangled.

30:06.971 --> 30:07.931
Guys, I want a castle.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.642
NARRATOR: <i>And Doug gave them one.
Right there.</i>

30:10.725 --> 30:12.685
<i>So, Doug logically thought...</i>

30:12.769 --> 30:15.396
DOUGLAS: <i>I did have some knowledge
about what made a Disney castle,</i>

30:15.480 --> 30:16.481
I just, not a real one.

30:16.564 --> 30:20.193
NARRATOR: <i>Well, that's easy. Imagination!
So, Doug used his.</i>

30:20.276 --> 30:25.198
I tried to come up with stories
about if there's a door,

30:25.281 --> 30:27.367
or if there's a window,
or there's a turret,

30:27.450 --> 30:29.494
whose window turret is that?

30:30.161 --> 30:31.955
DOUG: <i>So, there's a story
behind everything.</i>

30:32.038 --> 30:33.915
NARRATOR: <i>But his drawings
were pretty good, too.</i>

30:33.998 --> 30:35.792
It was beautiful, and I just kinda go,
"Okay."

30:35.875 --> 30:38.086
NARRATOR: <i>But beyond just great designs...</i>

30:38.169 --> 30:39.170
They wanted something
that felt more like a...

30:39.254 --> 30:40.171
-...home.
-Home.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.508
-NARRATOR: <i>Because...</i>
-In China, royalty live in palaces.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.218
They do not live in fortresses.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.721
It was a much better starting point
to sort of get something

30:48.805 --> 30:51.182
that would resonate with,
you know, our Chinese guests.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.393
NARRATOR: <i>And when the time came
to choose a design...</i>

30:53.476 --> 30:58.565
I got an email saying,
"Hey, would you like to work,

30:58.648 --> 31:02.151
actually making that castle
actually get really made?"

31:03.653 --> 31:05.822
I have to say,
I think he kind of nailed it.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.783
When you work for a company
that you love what they do,

31:08.867 --> 31:09.993
and what they stand for,

31:10.076 --> 31:14.330
there's even a second level of joy,
you know, that comes for it.

31:14.414 --> 31:17.792
So, I called my wife, you know,
and she started crying on the phone.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.378
NARRATOR: <i>But there was no time
for tears of joy, because...</i>

31:20.461 --> 31:24.591
Now, we had to get down to the detail
of how we're gonna make this thing stand,

31:24.674 --> 31:27.260
look the way we want it to look,
all sides.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.345
NARRATOR: <i>And that's just on the outside.</i>

31:29.429 --> 31:30.555
What do you do? Where do you start?

31:30.638 --> 31:33.725
NARRATOR: <i>As the chief architect
of Doug's design...</i>

31:33.808 --> 31:37.645
"What the heck? You're an architect?"
I go, "I'm an Imagineer."

31:37.729 --> 31:41.274
<i>-Of course, but he's also...
</i>-He is truly a master architect.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.444
He sees not only the building,
he sees the ground,

31:44.527 --> 31:47.655
and what's inside the ground,
and all the elements.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.865
NARRATOR: <i>But this is China,</i>

31:48.948 --> 31:51.200
<i>and there were more elements
than a mahjong set.</i>

31:51.284 --> 31:54.495
Now, the trick with the Shanghai castle

31:54.579 --> 31:59.125
was that the Chinese clients told me
in our meetings in Shanghai,

31:59.208 --> 32:03.171
"We consider this an E ticket."
A castle as an E ticket?

32:03.254 --> 32:05.632
NARRATOR:
<i>An E ticket is a leftover expression</i>

32:05.715 --> 32:08.760
<i>from back when Disneyland
used coupons for rides.</i>

32:08.843 --> 32:12.305
<i>For example, Space Mountain...
is an E ticket.</i>

32:12.388 --> 32:15.099
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean was an E ticket.</i>

32:15.183 --> 32:19.270
<i>And the Tower of Terror?
Definitely an E ticket.</i>

32:19.354 --> 32:22.815
<i>So, putting an E ticket ride
inside a castle...</i>

32:22.899 --> 32:27.153
-It's really complicated, technically.
-NARRATOR: <i>So, what they did was create...</i>

32:27.236 --> 32:29.948
Fantasyland boat ride
through the basement of the castle,

32:30.031 --> 32:31.658
<i>and there are three show scenes in there.</i>

32:31.741 --> 32:32.867
NARRATOR: <i>Not only that...</i>

32:32.951 --> 32:35.495
There's a castle walkthrough
on the third floor.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.916
NARRATOR: <i>And after you visit
those attractions, you can drop by...</i>

32:39.999 --> 32:42.293
-...Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.
-NARRATOR: <i>And after that...</i>

32:42.377 --> 32:45.046
The Princess Meet-and-Greets.
We have to have that.

32:45.129 --> 32:48.800
-NARRATOR: <i>Oh! And don't forget...</i>
-There's also the 250-seat restaurant.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.635
NARRATOR:
<i>But, they were just getting started.</i>

32:50.718 --> 32:53.805
How do you keep going
with floor after floor after floor?

32:53.888 --> 32:59.435
NARRATOR: <i>So, if this castle is meant
to be a home, A, why is it so big?</i>

32:59.519 --> 33:03.064
<i>And B, who lives in this home? The answer?</i>

33:03.147 --> 33:06.776
All of our princesses.
They all lived in this place.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.862
NARRATOR: <i>Catering to the needs
of multiple princesses,</i>

33:09.946 --> 33:11.155
<i>Doug learned fast.</i>

33:11.239 --> 33:13.908
Well, we need
to make those stairwells wider,

33:13.992 --> 33:17.829
because how is Belle going to get down
the staircase to make it her entrance.

33:17.912 --> 33:19.580
because she's got a giant hoop skirt?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.207
NARRATOR: <i>And there was that time...</i>

33:21.290 --> 33:23.710
I had designed
the entrance into the castle.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.421
<i>-But, of course...
</i>-You know, my door wasn't big enough.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.131
NARRATOR: <i>And then, there was that time...</i>

33:28.214 --> 33:30.883
There were some turrets, and I asked,
"Could I move those over

33:30.967 --> 33:32.051
another eight feet?"

33:32.844 --> 33:34.679
Coulter Winn, the architect, he goes,

33:34.762 --> 33:37.932
"No, not unless you want to collapse
the entire building."

33:38.016 --> 33:41.436
NARRATOR: <i>Hmm. That's a dreary thought.
Oh, and speaking of dreary...</i>

33:41.519 --> 33:45.273
There's a lot more pollution in Shanghai,
and so, everything has this gray pallor.

33:45.356 --> 33:46.399
NARRATOR: <i>So, to combat this...</i>

33:46.482 --> 33:49.652
You have to make the colors
more saturated or brighter.

33:49.736 --> 33:54.365
And so, we hang paint samples on buildings
just to see how well it holds up.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.284
NARRATOR:
<i>But Doris didn't use a bit of tape </i>

33:56.367 --> 33:57.785
<i>and a stepladder to hold it up.</i>

33:57.869 --> 34:01.205
Doris has a giant crane out there

34:01.289 --> 34:04.083
with four-by-eight-foot sheets of plywood
they painted.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.419
DOUG: <i>And so, she hoisted these things
up in the air,</i>

34:06.502 --> 34:09.047
<i>so that everybody could see
what color they were.</i>

34:09.130 --> 34:11.883
And I thought, "Wow, that woman
is capable of doing anything."

34:11.966 --> 34:14.886
NARRATOR: <i>But, more than holding
bits of plywood aloft,</i>

34:14.969 --> 34:19.182
<i>Doris had assembled a team
that built not just a castle,</i>

34:19.265 --> 34:21.601
<i>and not just a home for princesses,</i>

34:22.060 --> 34:25.313
<i>not just a symbol
to represent all China...</i>

34:25.396 --> 34:26.647
-It's a big one.
-NARRATOR: <i>Yeah.</i>

34:26.731 --> 34:29.776
<i>This thing is really, seriously huge.</i>

34:30.401 --> 34:34.405
<i>On June 16th, 2016,
Shanghai Disneyland opened,</i>

34:34.489 --> 34:37.158
<i>along with its triumphant castle,</i>

34:37.241 --> 34:40.203
<i>where it wasn't just the princesses
who felt at home.</i>

34:40.286 --> 34:43.831
It is sort of a moment of accomplishment.

34:44.957 --> 34:48.711
But culturally,
it made me feel like this is my home,

34:48.795 --> 34:50.546
<i>and I think it worked.</i>

34:51.089 --> 34:53.341
NARRATOR: <i>And as for Doug, the new guy...</i>

34:53.424 --> 34:54.967
DOUG: <i>The drawings that I did,</i>

34:55.051 --> 34:57.512
large portions of them
are still in the castle to this day,

34:57.595 --> 35:00.223
and they actually physically got built,
which is a strange experience

35:00.306 --> 35:02.433
to go from making animated movies,

35:02.517 --> 35:05.478
<i>and then, one day,
you actually can walk out there</i>

35:05.561 --> 35:07.355
<i>and see something
that you drew on your desk,</i>

35:07.438 --> 35:08.648
<i>and it's a shocking experience,</i>

35:08.731 --> 35:10.608
<i>and one that's very humbling
at the same time.</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:12.110
But it's a great kick.

35:12.193 --> 35:15.488
BOB: <i>I think, for me,
it's an opportunity to take a fresh look.</i>

35:16.447 --> 35:18.658
You don't get that opportunity very often.

35:18.741 --> 35:21.119
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, so true. Well, who knows?</i>

35:21.202 --> 35:22.328
<i>Maybe one day,</i>

35:22.411 --> 35:25.206
<i>there'll be another new Disney Park
somewhere in the world.</i>

35:25.289 --> 35:26.833
<i>And when that day comes,</i>

35:26.916 --> 35:31.462
<i>perhaps this same team
could create another unique castle.</i>

35:31.546 --> 35:36.342
<i>But until that day,
things are good just the way they are.</i>

35:37.468 --> 35:39.428
<i>Aren't they? Uh-oh.</i>

35:39.512 --> 35:41.139
We proposed
something pretty controversial.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.266
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, known for his big, bold ideas...</i>

35:43.349 --> 35:45.184
I don't think we should do Main Street.
I don't think we should do Frontierland.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.812
NARRATOR: <i>What was Bob Weis planning
this time?</i>

35:47.895 --> 35:49.939
He asked me to come to his office one day.

35:50.022 --> 35:54.152
And we proposed, for the first time ever,
to renovate a castle and change it.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.946
NARRATOR: <i>Change a castle? But which one?</i>

35:57.029 --> 35:59.031
He asked me to take a look
at the Hong Kong castle.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.867
NARRATOR:
<i>Yeah, it could use some updating.</i>

36:00.950 --> 36:02.118
<i>Oh, that's better.</i>

36:02.201 --> 36:03.870
We felt Hong Kong

36:03.953 --> 36:08.040
should have its own castle
with its own spirit, its own scale.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.877
NARRATOR: <i>But that castle
is a replica of the original,</i>

36:10.960 --> 36:12.962
<i>the castle that started it all.</i>

36:13.045 --> 36:14.422
I was actually frightened

36:14.505 --> 36:16.757
that I was being asked
to touch that building.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.010
NARRATOR: <i>You don't wanna be messing
with that, do you?</i>

36:19.093 --> 36:21.095
DOUG: <i>That's a symbol
of the Walt Disney Corporation.</i>

36:21.179 --> 36:22.305
NARRATOR: <i>What would Walt say?</i>

36:22.388 --> 36:25.850
The castle that he built,
that wasn't all of it.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.311
-NARRATOR: <i>What?</i>
-He actually had more concept

36:28.394 --> 36:32.732
<i>to build that castle into another form,
but timing...</i>

36:32.815 --> 36:35.026
-NARRATOR: <i>And money.</i>
-It was just what it was.

36:35.109 --> 36:38.988
So now, we have the opportunity
to kind of continue his legacy.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.198
NARRATOR: <i>And so, here's the plan.</i>

36:40.281 --> 36:44.660
BOB: <i>We proposed to take the
existing castle in Hong Kong Disneyland,</i>

36:44.744 --> 36:46.537
with the park still full of guests,

36:46.621 --> 36:49.582
and build another castle
that reaches out and embraces it.

36:49.665 --> 36:50.583
NARRATOR: <i>Embracing it?</i>

36:50.666 --> 36:52.793
-Yay!
-NARRATOR: <i>Well, that sounds lovely.</i>

36:52.877 --> 36:56.881
<i>And, of course, this would be a group hug,
because once again,</i>

36:56.964 --> 36:59.759
<i>it's a house
for all the Disney princesses.</i>

36:59.842 --> 37:00.885
<i>And not only that.</i>

37:00.968 --> 37:04.096
<i>The same group
that reinvented castles for Shanghai...</i>

37:04.180 --> 37:05.431
I like a good challenge.

37:05.514 --> 37:08.976
NARRATOR: <i>Well, they were back, too.
With, yes, controversial ideas.</i>

37:09.060 --> 37:12.230
Since it's representing
all the princesses, I took a risk.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.733
-NARRATOR: <i>Well, remember, Doris is...</i>
-Capable of doing anything.

37:15.816 --> 37:18.945
I want all the princess colors
in that castle.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.242
And so when I had to pitch this
in front of Bob Iger, he sat there,

37:24.325 --> 37:26.994
he didn't say much at first,
and then, he said...

37:28.079 --> 37:29.538
<i>"I love it."</i>

37:29.622 --> 37:33.834
And I went,
"Phew. Thank goodness. He loves it. Yay!"

37:33.918 --> 37:35.920
NARRATOR: <i>So, once again, work began.</i>

37:36.003 --> 37:40.549
<i>But this time, and for the first time,
while guests were in the park.</i>

37:40.633 --> 37:44.804
You can imagine figuring out
how to build parts of the castle off-site,

37:44.887 --> 37:47.932
<i>and how to color them off-site,
and then, bringing it together.</i>

37:48.015 --> 37:50.101
Some of these pieces are huge.

37:50.184 --> 37:53.396
NARRATOR: <i>The Hong Kong castle
pulls up the drawbridge</i>

37:53.479 --> 37:57.984
<i>in our story of castles,
a story that spanned the globe.</i>

37:58.067 --> 38:01.237
<i>And for one guy in particular,
it all started with an email.</i>

38:01.320 --> 38:05.116
Saying, "Hey, we really like
that castle that you presented."

38:05.199 --> 38:07.535
NARRATOR: <i>But there is a little part
of that story</i>

38:07.618 --> 38:09.328
<i>that Doug didn't tell us before.</i>

38:09.412 --> 38:10.997
DOUG: <i>'Cause I've never
gotten an email like this before,</i>

38:11.080 --> 38:13.499
and I just didn't wanna take this
out of context,

38:13.582 --> 38:16.752
and say anything to anyone
in the case that I'm misreading this.

38:16.836 --> 38:20.172
And so, I closed my email.

38:20.756 --> 38:25.761
The next day, I went and got Dan Cooper,
who is the art director for Tangled.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.848
I said, "I want you to look
at this email that I got. I don't...

38:29.765 --> 38:32.101
<i>I think it says something
really important."</i>

38:32.184 --> 38:33.436
NARRATOR: <i>And Dan said...</i>

38:33.519 --> 38:37.273
"Oh, my gosh!
They want you to design this castle."

38:37.356 --> 38:40.192
And I actually started crying.

38:40.276 --> 38:44.322
And... 'cause, you know,
that's gonna make my mom happy.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.325
NARRATOR: <i>And since that little bit
of news hit his inbox,</i>

38:47.408 --> 38:48.659
<i>Doug went from being...</i>

38:48.743 --> 38:51.078
Production Designer
for Walt Disney Feature Animation.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.623
<i>...to a confident Imagineer
who can proudly say...</i>

38:54.707 --> 38:56.709
I'm Doug Rogers, and I design castles.

38:56.792 --> 39:00.338
NARRATOR: <i>And there aren't many people
on planet Earth who get to say that.</i>

39:01.005 --> 39:03.549
<i>-But for those who do...
</i>-You feel proud.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.885
<i>...they have a big responsibility.</i>

39:06.260 --> 39:10.473
NARRATOR: <i>Not just as builders
of massive, wonderful structures...</i>

39:10.556 --> 39:13.059
I had my hard hat, and it said "Tracy."

39:13.392 --> 39:16.020
TRACY: <i>Um, I was pretty proud.</i>

39:16.103 --> 39:20.024
NARRATOR:
<i>And not just as custodians of a symbol</i>

39:20.983 --> 39:23.694
<i>that stands for everything that Walt,</i>

39:23.778 --> 39:27.865
<i>and the entire
Walt Disney Company represents...</i>

39:27.948 --> 39:29.241
DORIS: <i>The castle has a meaning.</i>

39:29.325 --> 39:33.204
<i>It has a legacy element
that goes back to Walt's original vision.</i>

39:33.287 --> 39:35.873
It's an absolute icon.

39:35.956 --> 39:40.586
As the center of the park, as an icon,
it was the perfect choice.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.089
NARRATOR: <i>But most of all,
it's to the guests,</i>

39:43.172 --> 39:45.633
<i>who stand at the foot of these castles,</i>

39:45.716 --> 39:48.010
<i>look upwards, and dream.</i>

39:48.094 --> 39:49.512
It does mean fairy tales.

39:49.595 --> 39:54.141
When you see the wonderment in their eyes,
and the joy, that's why we do it.

39:54.225 --> 39:58.229
Whenever I stand in front of that castle,
I still get that feeling of being a child,

39:58.312 --> 40:02.733
<i>and remembering that joy
that it just marked and symbolized</i>

40:02.817 --> 40:04.944
<i>the possibility of the impossible to me.</i>

40:05.027 --> 40:09.240
JEANETTE: <i>That the fantasy could be real.
That it could be actualized in a place.</i>

40:09.323 --> 40:10.991
<i>And that I could touch it,
and I could feel it,</i>

40:11.075 --> 40:12.201
<i>and I could be part of it.</i>

40:12.284 --> 40:13.828
That's what that was for me.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.288
NARRATOR:
<i>No matter where you are in the world,</i>

40:16.372 --> 40:20.709
<i>when you see
this unmistakably recognizable silhouette,</i>

40:20.793 --> 40:21.919
<i>you know...</i>

40:22.002 --> 40:26.090
WALT: <i>That when you wish upon a star,
your dreams do come true.</i>

40:28.050 --> 40:30.052
(grandiose music)
