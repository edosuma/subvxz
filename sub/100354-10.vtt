25:29.495 --> 25:31.330
All right, you ready for this?

25:34.633 --> 25:35.934

‐ Wait.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.202
Did they pop your champagne?

25:37.269 --> 25:38.771
‐ Guys...
all: Don't cry.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.372
‐ Don't cry.
‐ Take a deep breath.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.874
‐ I don't wanna be that girl.
‐ No, no, no, no, no.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.742

my moment...

25:43.809 --> 25:44.910
[sniffles]

25:44.977 --> 25:46.612
And she took that from me.

25:46.678 --> 25:49.181
Hannah Ann opened the bottle
of champagne that I‐‐

25:49.248 --> 25:51.750

25:53.886 --> 25:55.354
[audience laughing]

25:55.421 --> 25:56.989
[chuckles] You okay?
‐ I'm wet.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.092
‐ She's been crying for weeks.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.193
I just wanna make sure
that you're okay,

26:01.260 --> 26:02.728
'cause I know you...

26:02.795 --> 26:04.363
you had a couple...

26:04.430 --> 26:05.497
‐ Very sad.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.965
‐ Sad that he's dating
other people?

26:07.032 --> 26:08.333
‐ Yeah.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.735
‐ But it is what we signed up
for, unfortunately.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.671
‐ But that doesn't make things
easier.

<i>‐ If Peter sees</i>

26:14.773 --> 26:16.442

26:16.508 --> 26:19.078
way back to wherever
the [bleep] Iowa is,

26:19.144 --> 26:20.546
because she's nuts.

26:20.612 --> 26:22.381
Last night...

26:22.448 --> 26:24.583
Kelsey was, like, going
through a mental breakdown.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.752
And I've seen multiple times

26:26.819 --> 26:29.054
that she's been
drinking excessively.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.389
<i>[tense music]</i>

26:30.456 --> 26:31.623
‐ So do we wanna talk about

26:31.690 --> 26:34.226
who said I was
emotionally unstable today?

26:34.293 --> 26:35.527
‐ I did talk to Peter
about you.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.596
I was concerned
'cause Peter needs to know.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.164
‐ Peter needs to know what?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.233
That you are concerned
for Kelsey?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.135
‐ That I saw
alcoholic tendencies.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.270
<i>‐ Tammy can't keep</i>

26:45.337 --> 26:46.338

26:46.405 --> 26:48.774
Tammy is a crazy person.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.576
Like, she's nuts.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.177
‐ But you brought up Alayah.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.213
‐ He brought up Alayah.
‐ He brought up Alayah.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.181
So don't you ever try me
one more time, Tammy.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.349
I never brought up Alayah.

26:57.416 --> 26:58.517
‐ You told him that there
was someone‐‐

26:58.584 --> 26:59.551
‐ No, shut the [bleep] up,
Tammy.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.652
‐ You shut the [bleep] up!

27:00.719 --> 27:01.653
‐ No, I didn't.
‐ There was people

27:01.720 --> 27:02.788
in that [bleep] group date,

27:02.855 --> 27:03.956
and you said,
"There's someone here..."

27:04.022 --> 27:04.990
‐ No.
‐ "That wasn't here

27:05.057 --> 27:05.991
for the right reasons."
‐ No.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.159
‐ And you don't think that

27:07.226 --> 27:08.427
he was gonna ask you?
‐ No, I didn't.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.329
‐ She gets so much joy
bringing people down,

27:10.395 --> 27:14.166
and I have no space in my heart
for people like that.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.335
The fact that you have
to bring up other girls is

27:16.401 --> 27:18.971
frustrating to every single
one of us.

27:19.037 --> 27:21.106
I needed this time,

27:21.173 --> 27:24.443
and so
I'm so [bleep] frustrated.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.079
<i>‐ Mykenna's on borrowed time.</i>
<i>She's been here way too long.</i>

27:27.146 --> 27:29.081
I'm wearing black today
because it's her funeral.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.317
It really makes me sick that
people like you come in here

27:32.384 --> 27:34.620
trying to brand themselves,

27:34.686 --> 27:36.054
and the next thing
you're looking for is

27:36.121 --> 27:37.055
just the hashtag.

27:37.122 --> 27:38.524
‐ Shut up.
Like, honestly,

27:38.590 --> 27:40.058
like, I just can't
deal with you anymore.

27:40.125 --> 27:41.860
I don't know what
your goal was the other night,

27:41.927 --> 27:43.395
maybe to make me feel small
and weak.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.697
But at the end of the day,
you made me find my damn voice.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.099
And I am a strong woman,

27:47.166 --> 27:49.902
and I will not let people
like you tear me down anymore.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.938
‐ I'm not perfect,
but I'm not as nearly

27:53.005 --> 27:56.675
malicious and fake
as these nasty girls.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.244
"Women Tell All," come at me.
I don't [bleep] care.

27:59.311 --> 28:02.347
[cheers and applause]

28:04.616 --> 28:08.220
‐ Wowee, wowee, wow‐wow!

28:08.287 --> 28:11.123
Let's go, Tammy!
[laughs]

28:11.190 --> 28:12.891
‐ Well, there's a lot
to unpack.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.693
Let's start.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.396
Uh, Victoria P. and Alayah...
‐ Mm‐hmm.

28:17.462 --> 28:21.066
‐ A lot of history
that was really confusing

28:21.133 --> 28:23.202
and convoluted, depending on
who you were talking to

28:23.268 --> 28:24.269
and what day it was.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.671
Sydney...

28:25.737 --> 28:28.507
what was your take
on the two of them?

28:28.574 --> 28:32.344
‐ My honest opinion of Alayah
is that she is scripted.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.948
I pride myself
in my judge of character,

28:36.014 --> 28:38.150
and when you get an inkling
about someone,

28:38.217 --> 28:39.651
it just‐‐it's right there.
And I was just like,

28:39.718 --> 28:42.354
"Something is just off
about this chick."

28:42.421 --> 28:43.889
Like, it's just weird
'cause, like,

28:43.956 --> 28:45.891
cameras would come on
and she would‐‐

28:45.958 --> 28:47.526
just this production,

28:47.593 --> 28:49.962
and just‐‐her voice
would just boom.

28:50.028 --> 28:52.231
‐ I felt like she was
treating it like a pageant,

28:52.297 --> 28:54.833
like a‐‐like a competition.
Like, she literally said,

28:54.900 --> 28:56.568
"I didn't wanna
be disqualified."

28:56.635 --> 28:58.136
Like, that's pageant talk.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.572
We're not here to win.
We're here to find love.

29:00.639 --> 29:03.075
‐ Alayah, why did you come
back to Cleveland?

29:03.141 --> 29:04.343
What was your intention?
‐ I know why.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.611
Because Alayah got on Reddit.
‐ Oh, my God.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.079
‐ That's why she went
right back to Cleveland.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.814
‐ Sydney...
‐ No, it's the truth.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.482
Let's be real.
‐ Were you watching me?

29:10.549 --> 29:12.317
Do you know? No.
‐ I wasn't watching you,

29:12.384 --> 29:13.885
but I watched the whole thing
and what you did to V. F.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.555
What do you mean?
‐ You were talking to girls

29:16.622 --> 29:18.123
about other things
that you had heard online

29:18.190 --> 29:21.560
about other people, and I just
thought that was malicious,

29:21.627 --> 29:23.929
to come in and start spreading
all this stuff.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.163
‐ That's my biggest regret
in this

29:25.230 --> 29:26.231
is that I didn't just shut up.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.566
I word‐vomit.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.601
Sometimes I just don't think
before I talk.

29:29.668 --> 29:31.236
And for those of you
who have seen me

29:31.303 --> 29:33.138
outside of this house,
am I not just a bit‐‐

29:33.205 --> 29:34.439
as obnoxious in person?

29:34.506 --> 29:35.641
Like I'm on cameras?
‐ Yes.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.109
‐ Thank you!
‐ I love it. I love it.

29:37.175 --> 29:38.810
‐ My voice
with the ten octaves,

29:38.877 --> 29:40.445
I've done it for 25 years.

29:40.512 --> 29:41.913
My mom calls it
my "princess voice."

29:41.980 --> 29:42.914
I'm sorry.
‐ She sounds like that

29:42.981 --> 29:44.516
in real life.
‐ I do it a lot.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.352
‐ The thing that ma‐‐that's
kind of sketchy to me is that

29:47.419 --> 29:49.121
you were expressing
these things,

29:49.187 --> 29:50.322
saying how you don't like
Alayah,

29:50.389 --> 29:51.723
how you don't like
her personality

29:51.790 --> 29:54.026
and all of these things,
but then at the Rose Ceremony,

29:54.092 --> 29:56.762
you're, like, holding
her hand and coddling her.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.430
And then in Cleveland,
you're wiping her tears,

29:58.497 --> 29:59.665
you run up to her
and give her a long hug.

29:59.731 --> 30:02.067
‐ I totally agree with y'all.
I am weird.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.902
‐ Weird?
That's fake‐‐it's not weird.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.570
‐ But‐‐okay.
‐ It's fake.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.272
You are the fakest person
in the house.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.074

that she is fake...

30:09.141 --> 30:10.575
[applause]
No, like, for real,

30:10.642 --> 30:12.678
you wanted everybody
to be against her.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.479
‐ I never wanted that.
I never‐‐

30:14.546 --> 30:16.081
‐ And that's not the point.
The point is that

30:16.148 --> 30:17.683
we know each other
outside of here.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.718
‐ And I failed at that.
I should have...

please?

We're gonna take
a quick time‐out.

to move forward from this.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.731

58:00.243 --> 58:01.545
What's up, brother?
‐ How's it going, man?

58:01.611 --> 58:05.048
How you doing, bro?
Good to see you.

58:05.115 --> 58:07.017
So much love.
So much love.

58:07.084 --> 58:08.652
Whoo.

58:08.719 --> 58:11.121
‐ So much love.
‐ So much love.

58:11.188 --> 58:12.289
‐ So much love...
‐ This is weird.

58:12.356 --> 58:13.657
‐ In the back of a Suburban.

58:13.724 --> 58:15.325
Whoo!
‐ That was weird. Yeah.

58:15.392 --> 58:16.693
We're not gonna talk
about that, so...

58:16.760 --> 58:18.428
‐ Those windows stayed
fogged up for a while.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.596
[laughter]

58:19.663 --> 58:21.264
‐ Not‐‐nope. Moving on.
Next question.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.566
That's...

58:22.632 --> 58:24.101
But honestly, that was‐‐
that was such a fun night,

58:24.167 --> 58:26.303
just seeing all the support
from Bachelor Nation.

58:26.370 --> 58:27.637
‐ Yeah, it was‐‐
it is awesome.

58:27.704 --> 58:29.139
It is a rare thing

58:29.206 --> 58:30.774
and a rare opportunity
to get to do that.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.509
It's also a rare opportunity

58:32.576 --> 58:34.644
to sit in front of all of your
ex‐girlfriends at once.

58:34.711 --> 58:36.013
‐ Yeah, I never thought
I would be

58:36.079 --> 58:39.649
in a room with so many exes,
but here we are, so...

58:39.716 --> 58:41.451
‐ When you became the Bachelor,

58:41.518 --> 58:43.420
did you have any idea what
you were really getting into?

58:43.487 --> 58:45.455
‐ No.
Honestly? No.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.524
And um...like,
I truly mean that.

58:47.591 --> 58:49.726
I remember I talked with
a lot of the previous Bachelors

58:49.793 --> 58:51.862
and tried to get advice, and...
‐ Right.

58:51.928 --> 58:53.063
‐ [sighs]
Just how to go about this.

58:53.130 --> 58:54.297
And there's truly no way

58:54.364 --> 58:55.399
until you go through
the whole experience.

58:55.465 --> 58:56.666
‐ Yeah.
‐ It's just‐‐

58:56.733 --> 58:58.802
you live and you learn,
and um, believe me,

58:58.869 --> 58:59.870
I know I made a lot
of mistakes,

58:59.936 --> 59:01.204
but I think‐‐yeah.

59:01.271 --> 59:03.040
I was dating so many women,
but when I was with

59:03.106 --> 59:04.975
individually each person,
I tried my best

59:05.042 --> 59:07.277
to be so present and give
myself to that relationship,

59:07.344 --> 59:09.246
and then inevitably,
you know, you hear things

59:09.312 --> 59:10.781
from around the house
and other women,

59:10.847 --> 59:12.716
and it's like you want
to tune that out

59:12.783 --> 59:15.852
and just be focused
and not have, um...

59:15.919 --> 59:17.921
anything kind of like,
you know, sway you,

59:17.988 --> 59:20.390
and it's just tough, man.
It's really tough.

59:20.457 --> 59:23.260
‐ What was your favorite part
of all of it?

59:23.326 --> 59:24.561
‐ I mean, honestly, just like,

59:24.628 --> 59:26.696
all the relationships
that I got to explore.

59:26.763 --> 59:28.698
And I'll never have

59:28.765 --> 59:30.700
that kind of experience
ever again in my life,

59:30.767 --> 59:33.070
um, getting to meet
so many amazing women,

59:33.136 --> 59:35.038
um, and just dive into
those relationships

59:35.105 --> 59:36.940
and just grow,
and hopefully, you know,

59:37.007 --> 59:38.875
they felt‐‐feel the same way.

59:38.942 --> 59:41.044
‐ I'm just honestly
grateful for you,

59:41.111 --> 59:43.213
because you taught me
a lot about myself.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.581
You taught me a lot
about the person

59:44.648 --> 59:47.584
that I want to be with
in the future,

59:47.651 --> 59:49.086
and I know, because of you,

59:49.152 --> 59:54.624
I'm gonna find somebody
that wants me just as bad

59:54.691 --> 59:56.393
that has those qualities

59:56.460 --> 59:58.595
that you showed me
that I wanted.

59:58.662 --> 59:59.930
‐ You know,
I think our relationship

59:59.996 --> 1:00:02.966
was definitely very unique
in how we connected

1:00:03.033 --> 1:00:04.634
on such a deep emotional level,
you know,

1:00:04.701 --> 1:00:06.369
from the very beginning,
and I think‐‐yeah.

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:08.105
At the end, it was‐‐
it was tough for me

1:00:08.171 --> 1:00:10.140
to realize that, you know,
we just...

1:00:10.207 --> 1:00:11.942
weren't each other's person.

1:00:12.008 --> 1:00:14.077
That was not easy
for me at all.

1:00:14.144 --> 1:00:17.180
‐ I had a very intense
emotional conversation

1:00:17.247 --> 1:00:18.815
with Victoria F.

1:00:18.882 --> 1:00:23.220
And that is a relationship
that I actually do understand,

1:00:23.286 --> 1:00:25.188
especially spending
a lot of time with you.

1:00:25.255 --> 1:00:26.656
A lot of people didn't.

1:00:26.723 --> 1:00:28.959
Victoria, why don't you
come up here and sit with us?

1:00:29.025 --> 1:00:32.062
[cheers and applause]

1:00:33.430 --> 1:00:35.765
‐ Hi. Good to see you.
You look beautiful.

1:00:37.934 --> 1:00:40.704
‐ Tonight, you and I had
a very emotional exchange,

1:00:40.770 --> 1:00:42.539
and you were really
able to express yourself,

1:00:42.606 --> 1:00:45.108
and so that's something
you weren't able to really do

1:00:45.175 --> 1:00:46.977
on the show,
so I'd love for you guys

1:00:47.043 --> 1:00:48.245
to have a conversation.

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:49.746
So, Victoria,
I'm gonna hand it over to you.

1:00:49.813 --> 1:00:50.780
What would you like to say?

1:00:50.847 --> 1:00:52.549
‐ I guess, first and foremost,

1:00:52.616 --> 1:00:55.619
I just want to say thank you

1:00:55.685 --> 1:00:58.221
just for, like,
how patient you were with me

1:00:58.288 --> 1:01:00.590
this whole entire,
you know, season.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.058
Um, that means so much.

1:01:02.125 --> 1:01:04.861
Watching back, it's like,
"How is he dealing with me?"

1:01:04.928 --> 1:01:07.597
Um, so thank you,

1:01:07.664 --> 1:01:09.900
and also, I'm sorry,

1:01:09.966 --> 1:01:11.801
'cause I put you through hell.

1:01:11.868 --> 1:01:13.036
And you didn't...
[both laughing]

1:01:13.103 --> 1:01:14.738
you didn't always deserve it.

1:01:14.804 --> 1:01:16.339
So...
‐ No, I um...

1:01:16.406 --> 1:01:18.608
I think I've always said, like,
you know, love is patient,

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:21.912
and, um, you know, when you
find someone that you‐‐

1:01:21.978 --> 1:01:23.446
you care strongly about,
like, I'm just‐‐

1:01:23.513 --> 1:01:25.348
I'm not someone that
gives up on that very easily.

1:01:25.415 --> 1:01:28.685
And so, um, I really do feel
good about our relationship

1:01:28.752 --> 1:01:31.321
and the growth that I think
both of us took from it.

1:01:31.388 --> 1:01:32.889
‐ I agree. Yeah.

1:01:32.956 --> 1:01:35.158
I'm just glad that
there's no, like, animosity,

1:01:35.225 --> 1:01:37.360
because I adore you, and like,

1:01:37.427 --> 1:01:39.796
the love that was there
was real to me,

1:01:39.863 --> 1:01:42.666
and yeah, I mean, I know
I've learned so much from you

1:01:42.732 --> 1:01:44.501
and our relationship,

1:01:44.568 --> 1:01:47.170
and I'll carry that
into my next relationship.

1:01:47.237 --> 1:01:48.338
‐ I'll say this
for both of you.

1:01:48.405 --> 1:01:49.673
You both followed your heart.

1:01:49.739 --> 1:01:50.974
I appreciate you coming up here
and talking.

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:52.475
‐ Yeah, of course.
‐ And opening up like that.

1:01:52.542 --> 1:01:53.843
And Peter, it's good
to have you here,

1:01:53.910 --> 1:01:55.111
and you're sticking around,

1:01:55.178 --> 1:01:56.246
'cause we got more with Peter.
‐ Let's do it.

1:01:56.313 --> 1:01:58.315
‐ Coming up right after this,

1:01:58.381 --> 1:01:59.449
we got your bloopers.

you didn't put me through
that Rose Ceremony

going into that night,

after watching it all back,

1:03:13.156 --> 1:03:16.726
do you regret giving
some of these other girls

1:03:16.793 --> 1:03:18.561
that caused a lot of drama

1:03:18.628 --> 1:03:20.497
so much opportunity
to get to know you

1:03:20.563 --> 1:03:22.832
and not some of the girls
that, you know,

1:03:22.899 --> 1:03:24.301
were genuine
and here for the right reasons?

1:03:24.367 --> 1:03:25.635
Do you regret it?

1:03:25.702 --> 1:03:27.504
‐ Um...
[crowd murmuring]

1:03:27.570 --> 1:03:29.739
You know, I‐‐I've seen
a lot going around

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:31.508
that I was someone
that rewarded the drama.

1:03:31.574 --> 1:03:33.576
Um, there's, you know,
definitely a lot of things

1:03:33.643 --> 1:03:34.778
I would've handled differently,

1:03:34.844 --> 1:03:36.980
but I only do have
my perspective,

1:03:37.047 --> 1:03:38.715
and I'm not trying to sound
like a broken record,

1:03:38.782 --> 1:03:40.350
but I truly was just
following my heart

1:03:40.417 --> 1:03:42.018
and doing what I felt
like I had to do,

1:03:42.085 --> 1:03:44.554
regardless of what, maybe,
people's opinions might be

1:03:44.621 --> 1:03:45.622

too much...

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:57.233
what do you say to that?

1:03:59.102 --> 1:04:00.070
to a certain extent,
can be good,

1:04:00.136 --> 1:04:01.237
and you can learn from it.
‐ Right.

1:04:01.304 --> 1:04:02.272
‐ And that's the way
I'm looking at it.

1:04:02.339 --> 1:04:03.873
Um, I made a lot of mistakes,

1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:05.909
and I can own up to that,
but I feel like,

1:04:05.975 --> 1:04:07.277
if I can learn from that
moving forward

1:04:07.344 --> 1:04:09.112

to talk about something

1:08:41.517 --> 1:08:44.053
that's been going on
for the last several seasons,

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:47.624
something that is not okay.

1:08:47.690 --> 1:08:50.793
There is so much passion
out there in Bachelor Nation,

1:08:50.860 --> 1:08:52.328
and it's not always positive.

1:08:52.395 --> 1:08:53.730
There's some negative
criticism.

1:08:53.796 --> 1:08:56.466
I completely understand that,
but unfortunately,

1:08:56.532 --> 1:08:59.469
there is a line
that has been crossed,

1:08:59.535 --> 1:09:01.638
and so it is time
to address that.

1:09:01.704 --> 1:09:05.341
And with that said, I thought,
"Who better to represent that?"

1:09:05.408 --> 1:09:06.876
Because it is something
that I know

1:09:06.943 --> 1:09:08.211
you have dealt with personally

1:09:08.277 --> 1:09:10.413

1:09:19.222 --> 1:09:20.890
but um, I'm really nervous
right now,

1:09:20.957 --> 1:09:22.725

1:09:22.792 --> 1:09:25.495
you know, the issue
that we're gonna discuss today

1:09:25.561 --> 1:09:28.598

most of us have experienced.

1:09:28.665 --> 1:09:31.034
That's online harassment,
and it's hate,

1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:32.735
and it's so unfortunate,

1:09:32.802 --> 1:09:36.172

so comfortable being mean

1:09:36.239 --> 1:09:38.307
and meaner than ever
on social media.

1:09:38.374 --> 1:09:40.143
And by not talking about it,

1:09:40.209 --> 1:09:43.579
I think people feel empowered
that they can continue

1:09:43.646 --> 1:09:45.415
to say certain things to us.

1:09:45.481 --> 1:09:47.817
And if we're ever gonna fix
this problem,

1:09:47.884 --> 1:09:49.619

hearing all these comments

1:13:09.952 --> 1:13:12.955

it's just hard.
