00:06.920 --> 00:08.920
[Billy] Timothy Flynn what shot his-self.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.120
[gunshot]

00:10.520 --> 00:13.320
[Billy] Were there any marks, on him?

00:13.400 --> 00:15.960
What is it you're looking for?

00:16.040 --> 00:17.320
[indistinct chatter]

00:17.360 --> 00:19.360
[Thin] Mrs. Myers.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.320
You got my cattle!

00:20.360 --> 00:22.000
Don't you go threatening me.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.320
Threat's already in your bed.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.080
[Jenson] I wish you well
with the delivery of those children.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.800
-[gunshots]
-[grunts]

00:29.160 --> 00:30.480
[Black-eyed Mog] What've we got?

00:30.560 --> 00:32.760
[tense music playing]

00:32.840 --> 00:34.840
[Katie] Killing and thieving?

00:34.920 --> 00:37.120
You ain't got the stomach for this, do ya.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.440
[Robert] Dear God!

00:38.560 --> 00:41.080
Think we need a word with Billy Myers.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.680
[Martha] Where is he?

00:42.760 --> 00:44.640
[heavy breathing]

00:44.720 --> 00:45.840
-[tense music playing]
-[horse neighing]

00:45.920 --> 00:47.160
Hey!

00:47.240 --> 00:49.600
I got someone looking for you.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.760
Seems to reckon you saw something,
during your soldiering days.

00:56.040 --> 00:56.920
[Cornelia] My friend...

00:57.000 --> 00:58.360
[gun cocks]

00:58.440 --> 00:59.840
Where is he?

01:00.280 --> 01:02.280
Tell me everything you know

01:02.360 --> 01:05.080
about the massacre at Chalk River.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.160
[fly buzzing]

01:19.520 --> 01:21.520
[horse neighing]

01:33.600 --> 01:36.920
[horses galloping]

01:45.920 --> 01:47.040
Morning.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.120
[Tobias] What you see is what you get,
four mules.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.640
Everything as requested.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.160
[Thomas] Just checking for the corkscrew.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.960
You surely are a puzzle of a gobbler.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.880
Real hunting outfit'd
need a flatbed for the hides.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.400
Just getting the lay of the land.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.280
-For what?
-Cattle.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.240
Ain't none.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.800
Come back in a couple of years.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.960
I'll have run this place black
with steer-horn.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.440
-Big business.
-In the wrong one if it isn't.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.000
We're good.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.760
Dandy set of duds.

02:40.760 --> 02:41.960
Pretty, aren't they?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.240
Saw a Cheyenne in something similar,

02:45.440 --> 02:47.600
'cept he'd used a white man's hide.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.480
Then he won't be needing mine.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.320
You're short.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.080
What's agreed, one gentleman to another.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.960
I look like a gentleman to you?

03:15.040 --> 03:16.680
I don't go on appearances.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.880
Then you best do.

03:20.520 --> 03:21.560
[gun cocks]

03:21.640 --> 03:23.000
The gentlemanly thing.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.080
[tense music playing]

03:32.120 --> 03:33.360
How much?

03:33.440 --> 03:36.880
Hundred dollars extra,
twenty-five per mule.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.080
-How'd you get to that?
-Thirty dollars per mule.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.320
Sure you can stand it.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.840
A man of your...

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
ambition.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.880
[eagle cawing]

03:51.960 --> 03:52.800
Pay him.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.200
Melmont. The money.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.280
[tense music playing]

04:04.080 --> 04:05.560
Deal's a deal.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.720
What the hell...

04:06.800 --> 04:10.760
That point beneath his oils,
that ain't his cock.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.920
[Thomas] Pay him. That is an order.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
[tense music playing]

04:21.520 --> 04:22.920
And I'll tell you for why.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.800
After we made the deal,

04:28.880 --> 04:30.240
I took a little walk around your town.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.080
Miserable shit-hole.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.880
It turns out that you've got
quite the reputation

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
for doing this sort of thing.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.600
So I thought it best,
I'll make a little deal of my own.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.080
Are you a patriot...

04:41.160 --> 04:43.080
Mr. uh, Biskind?

04:43.560 --> 04:46.240
It's 'cause I saw you got
a great big flagpole

04:46.360 --> 04:47.240
outside your house.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.640
And I'm a mad fan
of heraldry myself actually,

04:49.720 --> 04:51.600
I hope to have my own
coat of arms one day.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.240
Although, I don't know what I'd put on it.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.360
Numbers maybe
'cause I'm good with them you see

04:58.440 --> 05:00.760
and my big ol' sticking knife
that's for sure,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.320
'cause that's what got me started--

05:02.360 --> 05:03.680
Bullet in your brain-pan
is how it's gonna be--

05:03.760 --> 05:05.520
No, no.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.160
No, no, you, you're gonna wanna hear this,
trust me, trust me, it's interesting.

05:11.920 --> 05:16.440
So, uh, knowing that
this would be the way that it is,

05:18.120 --> 05:22.360
I've hidden a little bit of cloth
about a mile back.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.360
Now...

05:25.000 --> 05:28.480
if I don't tell you
where that bit of cloth is

05:29.400 --> 05:31.200
and if you don't go and pick it up

05:32.440 --> 05:33.800
and if you don't get back to Casper

05:33.880 --> 05:37.160
as quick as your little trotters
can carry you

05:37.240 --> 05:39.720
and you don't hoist
that little bit of cloth up

05:39.800 --> 05:42.160
that great big fucking flagpole of yours,

05:42.240 --> 05:45.160
then the man that I've paid
to keep watch for it,

05:45.240 --> 05:46.920
if he doesn't see it,

05:48.360 --> 05:50.320
then he's gonna kill your wife.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.520
[tense music playing]

05:57.960 --> 06:00.680
Nah, can't be so.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.400
Do I look like a gentleman to you?

06:05.920 --> 06:08.920
[horse neighing]

06:16.880 --> 06:17.960
Is it true?

06:24.720 --> 06:25.880
Deal's a deal.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.120
[theme music playing]

07:29.680 --> 07:33.680
[tense music playing]

07:48.880 --> 07:50.200
[Thin] Cheyenne...

07:51.200 --> 07:52.200
[Melmont] Blimey...

07:53.320 --> 07:54.720
looks like a side of beef.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.560
[Thin] Not to his mother.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.240
Why the display?

07:59.320 --> 08:01.320
Sure scares the shit outta me.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.960
I thought you said they were gone?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.000
They have.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.360
They coming back?

08:06.440 --> 08:08.600
[Thin] Nah, their day's done.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.840
[Melmont] Fuck for that.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.720
So, this place open for business then?

08:12.800 --> 08:14.960
-We need to bury him.
-[Melmont] What for?

08:15.040 --> 08:18.040
If he's scaring everyone,
means we got the place to ourselves.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.520
Let him do his job.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.240
[tense music playing]

08:39.080 --> 08:41.520
[tense music playing]

09:00.080 --> 09:01.520
Sergeant Whipp.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.600
They send you out?

09:06.640 --> 09:08.240
Corporal McClintock.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.360
Gone AWOL.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.280
Along with two others:

09:12.360 --> 09:14.200
Troopers Myers and Flynn.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.880
-Why?
-Hunting.

09:15.960 --> 09:16.960
Buffalo?

09:18.160 --> 09:19.840
Indians.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.120
Orders are leave 'em be.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.320
[Sergeant Ellroy]
Maybe that's why them three's gone AWOL.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.880
None of my business.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.040
Been mustered out, heading home.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.440
For good?

09:32.520 --> 09:34.360
War's over, in'it?

09:34.440 --> 09:37.400
N'yeah... [laughs]

09:52.600 --> 09:54.760
-[gunshots]
-[wolf whimpers]

09:57.120 --> 09:59.160
-You missed it.
-I winged it.

10:05.040 --> 10:05.880
That's a miss.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.640
Well, then I'll go and finish it off.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.720
Don't know why you shot at it
in the first place.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.040
[Melmont] A fucking wolf?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.880
Tell you what, I'll bring it back

10:25.000 --> 10:26.600
and we can make a nice
little stole out of it

10:26.640 --> 10:28.000
for your beautiful fiancee.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.440
But, don't worry,
I won't tell that her I shot it.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.000
She doesn't even know you exist.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.280
What Lady Cornelia Locke.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.280
Don't tell me...

10:37.720 --> 10:39.440
5 Holland Park West.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.360
And you know the Tradesman's entrance,
no doubt.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.840
Yeah, I know everything.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.600
Everything.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.160
That's my job.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.440
Stick the kettle on.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.560
He talks loose to the man
who pays his bills.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.600
Not me.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.720
Board of directors.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.520
Chose him to keep a check on my finances

11:06.600 --> 11:10.880
which you have to admit,
he shows a certain... panache.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.440
-You bad with money?
-What do they say?

11:15.120 --> 11:18.320
A man can lose a fortune many times over
but his confidence only once?

11:18.400 --> 11:20.800
Well, trust me,
as a man who has lost many fortunes,

11:20.880 --> 11:23.080
my confidence has taken
a hell of a battering.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.480
Yeah.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.400
It ain't good when a servant
tells his boss what to do.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.040
Don't worry about that.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.160
[grunts]

11:32.240 --> 11:33.920
In England we have a class system.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.600
So, for better or worse,
David Melmont knows exactly where he sits.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.080
Yeah, well, we don't have that here,

11:43.440 --> 11:45.440
so you best keep an eye on it.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.080
I seen what happens to men like him
in a place like this.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.840
Sometimes freedom ain't pretty.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.920
[tense music playing]

12:17.200 --> 12:18.280
[gun cocks]

12:18.360 --> 12:21.360
[tense music playing]

12:37.200 --> 12:39.640
[wolf growls]

13:05.680 --> 13:06.920
Come on then...

13:07.000 --> 13:10.120
[tense music playing]

13:24.840 --> 13:27.840
[horse galloping]

13:33.920 --> 13:34.920
Cheyenne.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.320
We leave 'em be.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.160
How many arrows do I need in my back
before you tell me I'm in trouble?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.600
None, because we ain't.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.280
[mimics gunshots]

14:14.240 --> 14:16.800
What you doing that for, eh,

14:17.600 --> 14:19.080
make sure they don't follow us?

14:19.840 --> 14:21.480
You said they wouldn't
give us any trouble.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.480
They won't.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.640
That wolf you shot give you more jip.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.880
They don't want trouble same as us.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.320
Well, I'm not sure
you'll be looking as kindly...

14:33.800 --> 14:35.600
when they start eating our profits.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.200
This one's lame.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.680
Gotta keep an eye on it.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.560
He's not the only one mate.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.160
Looks like the Delphi...

14:52.040 --> 14:53.200
made by God.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.680
You got a word for "Beauty"
in that ledger of yours?

14:58.760 --> 15:04.720
[Melmont] Yep, yep.
I, uh, I had it down as, uh...

15:04.800 --> 15:06.360
unforeseen costs".

15:06.440 --> 15:08.240
Well, thank God
I'm the one with the vision.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.840
No. I've got a code for that and all.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.800
Are you sure you want to hear it?

15:16.880 --> 15:19.080
I mean I don't want to
make your eyesight go all blurry.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.800
No, go on.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.800
[Melmont] Oh, all right well, er,
years one to five

15:25.880 --> 15:28.800
there'll be a six fold increase
in your profits.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.760
Making you very rich.

15:30.840 --> 15:35.960
And then er, years four,
yeah four to seven,

15:36.040 --> 15:39.480
the competition will arrive
driving up volume pushing down prices.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.040
But you'll still be rich.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.920
And then seven and eight,
the market will saturate.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.320
Prices will collapse...

15:50.080 --> 15:51.520
costs will balloon.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.040
And then by year ten, you'll go bust.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.480
And you the same.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.920
[Melmont] Ah, well, no,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
you see in this little book here,
this little book here.

16:01.080 --> 16:06.280
...er, yep, here,

16:06.360 --> 16:08.240
it tells me when exactly to get out.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.600
So if I were you,
I'd be watching me like a hawk.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.720
Already am.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.920
You see sir, you see, um...

16:22.280 --> 16:25.120
you never know, you never know.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.440
Maybe, maybe one day--

16:31.520 --> 16:35.800
maybe one day, uh,
me and you, we could be partners.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.520
[laughs]

16:55.880 --> 16:57.880
[scoffs] I fucking knows.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.400
Oh, I fucking knows it.

17:02.480 --> 17:07.200
Just like I know

19:28.320 --> 19:30.080

Sounds about right.

Judging by the color of your duds,
I'd say you been out here no time.

-On patrol.

On behalf of the First Regiment,
Colorado Volunteers.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560

Heard of him?

20:37.760 --> 20:38.760
You seen him?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.280
Nor anyone else besides.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.800
[Jerome] Well, he's out here.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.080
Why you want him?

20:50.200 --> 20:51.240
He killed my brother.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.800
[Jerome] Not just killed.

20:54.880 --> 21:00.560
Cut him up like stripped beef.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.280
[Thomas] What had he done?

21:03.960 --> 21:05.720
-Your, your, your brother--
-Whaddaya mean?

21:07.240 --> 21:08.200
For being here.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.040
Like you are now.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.800
Bit more than that though, ain't it.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.000
You were at Sand Creek, right?

21:17.080 --> 21:19.080
If you're First Volunteers.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.320
That were all sorts of horror
from what I hear.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.400
When ain't it?

When you made purses
out of women's private parts.

[Jerome] Still got it,
if you'd care to take a look--

21:33.080 --> 21:34.560
Woah. No...

21:36.520 --> 21:38.440
-Gentleman, please.
-You want for us to leave?

21:38.520 --> 21:40.720
-Getting that way.
-[Melmont] Not me!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.440
No, not me,
no I, I would very much like you to stay.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.080
Do you want to know why we’re here?

21:49.080 --> 21:55.000
This time next year, we're gonna bring
50,000 head of cattle, right here.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.640
That's a hundred thousand dollars
of my employers' money.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
That's big business.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.440
And I can't have anything
tapping off that.

No wolves, no lions
and definitely no fuckin' Indians.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.080

22:34.520 --> 22:38.680

this Hawkey fella?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.680
Same as he did to my brother.

so as he can watch hisself die.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.080

36:39.360 --> 36:42.400
We banged up, awaiting payment of a fine.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.600
Maybe he should just serve his time.

36:54.480 --> 37:00.440
Thing is... erm, it's not a jail.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.160
It's a well.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.760
Deep one.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.520
When the rains come,
it's gonna start filling up.

37:11.440 --> 37:16.640
There might be a week,
could be a month, but they will come.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.640
[tense music playing]

37:27.760 --> 37:29.160
How much?

37:29.200 --> 37:30.960
Two thousand pounds.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.440
Sterling.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.800
Why have you come to me?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.640
'Cause you... cause you are his fiancée.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.680
We are not engaged.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.640
Oh? Oh no, I thought he said he proposed.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.840
-He had...
-Ah.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.680
-Have you told my father--
-[Melmont] No, no, no.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.120
Nor anyone else besides.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.000
This was Thomas' last chance
and he'll never get another.

38:04.600 --> 38:08.160
It was me that made my father invest.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.640
[sighs]

38:11.760 --> 38:13.200
[Melmont] Well, there you go.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.160
Save yourself a few blushes too.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.480
Blushes I can live with.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.520
[Melmont] But ignominy he cannot.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.920
The Company neither.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.480
My father has spoken of you...

38:26.560 --> 38:28.040
-Yeah?
-[Cornelia] Yes.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.080
What's he... What's he say?

38:33.960 --> 38:35.320
Oh, I'm not sure.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.960
You started in--

38:38.040 --> 38:39.640
Started in, in the meat business, yeah--

38:39.680 --> 38:40.800
-Yes.
-Yeah, in the blood pits.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.320
And then?

38:42.400 --> 38:45.800
Well, then, the-- 'Cause I got...
I got me a head for figures, you see,

38:45.880 --> 38:48.200
-so...
-So here you are.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.800
[Melmont] Oh, yeah, but don't you worry,
Miss Locke, I still know my place.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.840
Well, no one should know that.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.520
[Melmont]
Well, then I must be a bit thick...

38:59.040 --> 39:00.440
loyal servant as I am.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.200
To the company.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.520
To Mister Trafford.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.360
And to your good self, of course.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.640
Now more than ever.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.200
But we can't leave him in his cotton socks
stuffed down a well, now can we?

39:22.320 --> 39:23.640
-No.
-No.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.400
No.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.160
No.

39:39.560 --> 39:43.000
I sometimes wonder
if there's horror in us all.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.440
There is.

39:47.960 --> 39:51.800
Which is why pretty rooms
like this are so important.

39:54.000 --> 39:54.960
They keep it from us.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.960
[scoffs]

39:59.400 --> 40:02.560
And this really is quite the beautifullest
room I've ever seen in my life.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.880
[tense music playing]

40:14.960 --> 40:16.360
I'll get you the money.

40:18.560 --> 40:21.560
[piano playing]

40:31.000 --> 40:32.520
[knocks on door]

40:56.600 --> 40:57.560
Morning.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.560
Miss Locke.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.640
What, did you think I was the postman?

41:02.680 --> 41:04.920
Erm, I think he's already been.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.480
[door closes]

41:47.480 --> 41:48.800
[door opens]

41:58.400 --> 41:59.360
[Cornelia] It's from Thomas.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.160
Not him.

42:04.560 --> 42:05.440
You.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.160
All of it.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.080
Did they arrest you?

42:15.160 --> 42:16.560
Yes.

42:16.640 --> 42:17.680
And the well?

42:19.520 --> 42:20.360
[Melmont] D'you know what?

42:21.880 --> 42:23.200
D'you know what I learnt?

42:27.600 --> 42:28.760
[door closes]

42:31.920 --> 42:36.280
"Hate" is a hell of a lot warmer
than a bear skin coat.

42:36.360 --> 42:39.360
Although, my toes are a bit black.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.760
And, er, the fine was very steep,

42:47.600 --> 42:50.560
let me tell ya, it almost cleared me out.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.560
-Are you thinking of shopping me--
-As soon as you leave this room--

42:54.640 --> 42:56.280
-Nah, you won't--
-I will, I will.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.920
I'm going to open that window
and I'm going to scream,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.040
"Liar. Thief. Killer."

43:04.800 --> 43:07.520
You won't make it
as far as the street corner.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.520
Oh, no.

43:10.600 --> 43:11.920
'Cause you see...

43:13.440 --> 43:17.160
I'm going all the way to Colorado!

43:18.480 --> 43:19.840
The Alamosa River!

43:20.840 --> 43:24.880
I got me a little mate
and he's gonna show me the way.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.320
And with that money there--

43:29.160 --> 43:30.520
And with that money--

43:30.600 --> 43:32.160
With that money--

43:33.640 --> 43:35.680
[tense music playing]

43:35.800 --> 43:40.800
Yeah, we're gonna buy us a stake
in a gold mine, a big one.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.520
Because me and that country...

43:44.920 --> 43:45.880
[finger snaps]

43:46.880 --> 43:48.440
-We're like that.
-Get out.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.600
But we haven't made
a little deal yet, have we?

44:00.320 --> 44:04.120
And I'll tell yous what,
I'm gonna promise you,

44:06.080 --> 44:10.800
I'll never talk about this
and you're gonna do the same.

44:13.080 --> 44:18.200
I tell you what, though,
you're right about these rooms.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.200
They do mean nothing.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.040
[gibbers]

44:30.840 --> 44:31.960
[hushes]

44:37.000 --> 44:38.360
I took on a wolf once.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.640
A fucking wolf!

44:43.280 --> 44:46.280
[tense music playing]

44:48.240 --> 44:51.240
[piano playing]

45:10.800 --> 45:11.960
[Melmont] What's that?

45:15.240 --> 45:19.400
Erm... Antonin Dvorak?

45:21.520 --> 45:22.760
It's missing a bit.

45:22.840 --> 45:23.760
Yeah?

45:28.400 --> 45:29.400
Yeah.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.560
She's taken to her bed.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.600
[man] Oh?

45:39.160 --> 45:41.240
Hmm. I'll show myself out.

45:42.680 --> 45:43.760
You do the same.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.600
Not yet, though, eh?

45:50.640 --> 45:51.840
Keep playing for a bit.

45:53.760 --> 45:54.640
It's pretty.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.440
[piano playing]

47:29.040 --> 47:30.320
[sniffles]

47:32.640 --> 47:33.680
[sighs]

47:35.320 --> 47:38.320
[violin music playing]

47:46.280 --> 47:47.360
[Melmont] Deal is a deal.

47:50.640 --> 47:54.600
Now, put your gloves back on,
someone will notice.

47:57.080 --> 48:00.080
[violin music playing]

48:02.400 --> 48:04.560
Alamosa!

48:14.920 --> 48:16.440
[gunshots]

48:18.080 --> 48:20.800
[Thomas]
I know the horror was not mine by design.

48:20.880 --> 48:25.000
But it was I, alone, who made the choice
to come to this place.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.760
I, who looked to rescue my fortunes
with such wayward risk

48:28.840 --> 48:33.480
and it was upon my trail
the Devil followed.

48:33.560 --> 48:37.200
Within my employ, in fact, he stole.

48:39.160 --> 48:40.640
Which leaves me no choice.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.720
It is here I must stay.

48:44.800 --> 48:47.240
Place myself against this country...

48:47.320 --> 48:49.320
let it test me, weather me,

48:49.400 --> 48:52.960
beat me for so many years
as it feels fit to so do.

48:53.800 --> 48:57.120
I'm not sure what material
will be fashioned by its end,

48:57.200 --> 49:01.240
or even if an end should come,
but I pray to God my previous life

49:01.320 --> 49:04.800
will have long since been eroded
and forgiven,

49:04.880 --> 49:08.440
by these hard... unforgiving winds.

49:09.480 --> 49:14.440
My final lines to you, my dear Cornelia,
must be a warning.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.400
Never come to this place.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.960
For, whatever the evils have been released
and however unwitting my part,

49:21.040 --> 49:25.680
let them remain here, with me,
so that you, there,

49:25.760 --> 49:30.280
may remain and live your life
in perfect safety...

49:31.000 --> 49:33.440
half a world away.

49:33.520 --> 49:37.280
It is in this profound wish
that I may remain,

49:37.360 --> 49:41.480
eternally, your true protector,

49:42.480 --> 49:43.640
Thomas Trafford.

49:45.880 --> 49:48.880
[slow music playing]

50:18.240 --> 50:21.240
[theme music playing]
