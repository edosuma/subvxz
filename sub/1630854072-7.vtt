WEBVTT

00:21.312 --> 00:23.815
Got ants in your pants, Julio?

00:23.898 --> 00:24.899
No way!

00:24.983 --> 00:28.278
Wakako's bitch, right?
Newby-boobs she stuck us with.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.612
Heard you're David's fan.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.615
But what
do you mean "stuck with us"?

00:32.699 --> 00:34.909
Wow! You're that!

00:34.993 --> 00:36.911
You're actually a fans now.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.873
Probably because you got all swole.

00:39.956 --> 00:40.915
Got iron?

00:40.999 --> 00:42.959
-Huh?
-Carrying, right?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.919
Yeah, I've got a Lexington.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.504
Don't cut it.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.549
Peashooter like that
won't even dent Maelstrom metal.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.051
Try this one out.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.471
Seriously, choom? A Satara!

00:54.554 --> 00:56.181
Fuck me. Nova!

00:56.264 --> 00:58.349
Tech shotties, man.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.726
Preem as hell.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.519
Charged-up shots.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.231
Oh yeah. Boom!

01:05.315 --> 01:06.524
Boom!

01:06.608 --> 01:08.193
Boom!

01:09.778 --> 01:11.071
-Knock it off!
-Wait! Watch my knees!

01:11.154 --> 01:11.946
Wait. Knees.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.866
So annoying! Why!

01:14.949 --> 01:16.409
Just remember to stay behind me.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.952
And be smart. Don't rush.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.956
You mean you want me to take rear?
Hey, I ain't no newb, man

01:22.040 --> 01:23.708
Attention, ladies.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.960
We're 'bout a minute out now.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.514
<i>Got a small army on our hands.</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:04.142
<i>Heaps of iron and turrets. Multiples</i>

03:04.225 --> 03:06.769
<i>Can't ping them all for quickhacks.</i>
<i>Not enough time.</i>

03:06.853 --> 03:08.688
<i>Front door's a dead zone. That's crystal.</i>

03:08.771 --> 03:11.024
<i>So, plan B. Find the back door.</i>
<i>Definitely.</i>

03:11.107 --> 03:13.443
Easy-peasy. Plan C's my pick.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.527
Agreed.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.779
<i>No backdoor swoop-in? Why?</i>

03:16.863 --> 03:18.698
<i>Knock yourself out. Get to it</i>

03:18.781 --> 03:21.034
<i>Hey, wait. Don't leave me.</i>

03:21.117 --> 03:22.952
Front door's all, looks like to me.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.038
You think.move.

03:28.333 --> 03:32.295
Hey. Who ordered lunch, mate?
You little babies lost?

03:32.378 --> 03:34.797
Think they're here to scout something?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.300
You dirtbags wanna get punked?

03:37.383 --> 03:39.552
Better start talking now, scumbag,

03:39.636 --> 03:42.013
before I drill you a fresh eyehole.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.806
You better stop before I do the same.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.809
Yeehaw!

03:49.229 --> 03:51.564
<i>Tagging complete. Short circ incoming.</i>

03:51.648 --> 03:52.482
Done.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.817
Not a millisec to spare, Mr. Plan C.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.195
Oh! They've got a netrunner!

04:06.037 --> 04:08.331
I don't wanna die, man.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.583
<i>Damn. Missed a few. All yours.</i>

04:10.667 --> 04:12.794
Come on! Come on! Let's go.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.129
Toys run dry.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.132
-That little bitch ran out of juice!
-Fuck her up!

04:18.216 --> 04:21.052
And now, here comes the big guns!

04:22.720 --> 04:24.138
A goddamn turret!

04:25.723 --> 04:26.641
<i>Kiwi.</i>

04:27.267 --> 04:29.394
Hey! Runner's grabbed a--

04:29.477 --> 04:32.397
Please, Kiwi. Give me some, Kiwi.

04:42.573 --> 04:47.954
Tiny birds. Aren't you scared?

04:48.037 --> 04:50.873
Yo! The fuck. Is that human?

04:50.957 --> 04:51.916
Huh?

04:59.757 --> 05:02.927
Did you never learn to fly?

05:13.771 --> 05:17.692
Time for major dick show.

05:29.579 --> 05:33.499
No, thanks, choom.
I know how to fly just fine.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.049
Nova! Zoot-zoot-zoot, bang!

05:41.132 --> 05:42.884
Those your fancy new leg implants?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.260
Looking damn good.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.387
<i>No more. All clear. Last one.</i>

05:46.471 --> 05:50.683
Room behind you. Target's there.
Her, others too. All friendlies.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.642
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

05:51.726 --> 05:53.770
Yo! Back room. On it.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.271
-Wait! Julio!
-Bang!

05:55.355 --> 05:57.273
-Watch out for--
-Bang!

06:08.493 --> 06:10.912
Isabella Morgan, you in here?

06:12.997 --> 06:15.166
I'm here 'cause your dad put out an SOS.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.085
You're safe now.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.675
<i>Wakako, there?</i>

06:25.468 --> 06:27.678
<i>You safely secured the target, I hear.</i>

06:28.262 --> 06:30.139
<i>Our client will be pleased.</i>

06:30.223 --> 06:33.309
<i>Yes, that Isabella was saved,</i>
<i>not-not butchered like cattle.</i>

06:33.393 --> 06:34.435
<i>Just did my part.</i>

06:34.519 --> 06:38.439
<i>Yes. Most impressive.</i>
<i>True. The rumors of you proved true.</i>

06:38.523 --> 06:39.899
<i>Oh, sorry about Julio.</i>

06:39.982 --> 06:41.984
No, no. Do not apologize.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.071
<i>The boy, fool,</i>
<i>insisted on the work with you.</i>

06:45.154 --> 06:47.198
<i>Not ready, I said. Not ready, indeed.</i>

06:47.281 --> 06:50.451
<i>Any new lead we get,</i>
<i>we-we will be in touch, David.</i>

06:51.077 --> 06:52.954
<i>Yeah. Good doing biz.</i>

07:03.548 --> 07:04.465
Thank you kindly.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.385
Appreciate the ride, Falco. Really.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.804
Always happy to keep the engine rolling.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.558
Come on. Dependable
wheelmen are hard to find.

07:13.641 --> 07:17.395
Oh, not sure about that. You've
gathered yourself quite the fan club.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.980
Oh. Julio, you mean?

07:19.564 --> 07:22.483
Knew that goose was bluffing
the moment we met.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.281
We'd land better talent if we
were all vets. Not everyone's like Maine,

07:28.364 --> 07:30.158
willing to take a chance on us.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.034
Have to admit,
when I got the call,

07:32.118 --> 07:34.620
I took you for a pusher-punk wannabe.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.539
Truth is, you were.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.752
But now? Wellâ€¦

07:42.587 --> 07:45.006
Expect you'll fly higher
than Maine ever did.

07:47.341 --> 07:50.344
Right. Gonna roll
before this all turns to goop.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.513
Buzz me for your next big gig, huh?

07:52.597 --> 07:55.766
Till then. Later, David. Kiwi.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.019
-Yeah.
-Later.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.022
Honestly?

08:01.105 --> 08:04.358
I doubted you had it in you,
to take the reins.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.320
Couldn'ta. Not without
the city's preemest runner.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.740
Both know you don't mean me.
Where is she?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.286
Been asking her?

08:15.369 --> 08:18.748
Not anymore. Kinda gave up trying.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.459
Never pegged her as the type
to get all shook-up.

08:23.085 --> 08:26.172
More than what happened
to Maine and Dorio is at play, I think.

08:27.465 --> 08:31.886
<i>At the warehouse,</i>
<i>Lucy was acting, I don't know, strange.</i>

08:31.969 --> 08:33.346
Strange how?

08:33.429 --> 08:36.891
Hard to say. Whole thing's kind of a blur.
It might have been nothing.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.230
By the way.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.816
Wasn't it you who brought Lucy onboard,
found her a spot in the crew?

08:45.900 --> 08:46.734
That's right.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.153
She, like, ever talk to you about her past
or anything?

08:49.820 --> 08:53.282
Most of the cybes in our league
don't bring up the old days.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.328
Shame, greed. Some. Whatever.

08:57.411 --> 09:01.040
Either you're looking for a way out,

09:01.123 --> 09:03.209
or a way up, doesn't matter.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.045
-Yo, yo, yo!
-Hmm?

09:06.128 --> 09:07.838
David, why the long face?

09:07.922 --> 09:11.926
This nagging old hag keeping you
off the dancefloor?

09:12.843 --> 09:17.056
Although, some edgerunners die
in more shame than they started with.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.475
Yo. It ain't right to badmouth the dead.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.312
It's not my bro's fault
he got zeroed by some bare-dick psycho.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.275
Oh, whatevs! Have you ever seen
David dance? It's a riot.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.860
Sounds preem,
but I think I'm gonna bounce.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.738
-I gotta stop by Doc's.
-Seriously? Again?

09:32.822 --> 09:35.908
Been tellin' that bastard
you desperately need a dance chip.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.577
-At least a pop hit grind!
-Will do.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.328
See ya.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.709
Hey! I ain't good at playing just friends.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.211
Considered shaking up your approach?

09:47.295 --> 09:48.588
Yeah? How you figure?

09:49.171 --> 09:50.798
'Stead of hot and loud,

09:50.881 --> 09:53.968
I try cold, distant, and nerdy?

09:57.179 --> 10:00.891
It's an oversized faucet.
Arm socket connector's warped.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.603
Jamming that fucker in was a miracle.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.771
My advice, trash it.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.357
Got all kinds of next-gen chrome out back.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.358
I know you got the scratch.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.360
Nah, this one's good.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.864
Tsk. Fine. It's your funeral.

10:14.947 --> 10:19.160
Got any fresh muscle reinforcers?
Kiroshi's new model, maybe?

10:19.243 --> 10:22.413
Excuse me. Didn't know I had
a corm jack on my table.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.623
Oh, come on. I'm not.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.583
You need to chill, choom.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.794
Unless you want a strict diet
of immunoblockers.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.963
I'm doing just fine, Doc.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.590
Better than fine, actually.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.385
It's like, I feel better in metal
than in my own skin.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.848
Well, your affinity for cyberware
is fucking nuts, I'll grant you that.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.976
Ain't never seen a kid
bogged out quite like this.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.854
Lotta other peeps woulda cut by now.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.023
Believe yourself to be special?

10:49.106 --> 10:51.442
Must just be special, I guess.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.904
Ha! Makes you
Adam Smasher 2.0, choom.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.530
-Adam who?
-Christ.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.949
All this time
and you're still a fucking newb.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.702
Adam Smasher. Name to know.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.498
<i>To some, a hero of the 4th Corporate War,</i>

11:05.581 --> 11:09.752
<i>to others, a fully cyborged</i>
<i>boogeyman, a walking nightmare.</i>

11:09.835 --> 11:13.339
<i>But to all, a living legend, a skinny one.</i>

11:13.923 --> 11:16.300
<i>What kind of legend?</i>

11:16.384 --> 11:20.554
The kind that fills graveyards
on Arasaka's orders.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.306
An urban myth, that's all.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.601
Kiwi?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.186
<i>Whatâ€¦ What's up?</i>

11:27.269 --> 11:30.106
<i>Afterlife. Stop by. Can you come?</i>

11:30.189 --> 11:32.608
<i>Party's rolling. By the bar.</i>
<i>How many now?</i>

11:32.692 --> 11:35.111
<i>No, no. Possible client.</i>
<i>Wants to meet you.</i>

11:35.861 --> 11:38.614
-David.
-Yo. 'Sup, Kiwi?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.867
Good luck.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.123
I believe this is the first
we've met, Mister Martinez.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.626
Not exactly. Saw you swing by once
to talk to Maine.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.047
Indeed. Well, it's a pleasure.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.507
The name's Faraday.

11:58.592 --> 12:01.303
Got a job for me?

12:01.387 --> 12:05.015
Where's the fire?
Let me buy you a drink.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.894
I've heard a great deal about you, David.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.897
You're building quite the reputation.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.900
The Sandevistan from Santo
is one name I've heard.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.611
Got more than just the Sandy now.

12:17.695 --> 12:22.158
True. It's difficult
to spot the 'ganic amidst all that steel.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.287
Maine and I had an arrangement,
as you may know.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.621
I heard about it.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.374
He understood the need for crew chemistry.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.543
-Yeah.
-But as you saw,

12:32.626 --> 12:35.337
his flaw was in personal attachment.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.674
Familiarity muddies the mind,
leads to ruin.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.011
I hear you're also a teambuilder.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.847
Keep biz and private seperate,
if that's what you mean.

12:44.930 --> 12:49.894
I need convincing that you can work
at Maine's level, deliver as he did.

12:49.977 --> 12:53.522
-A test?
-You're welcome to think of it that way.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.692
Test all you want,
but we don't do jobs on the cheap.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.696
I assure you.
Nothing from my desk is cheap.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.829
A job from Militech?

13:08.913 --> 13:11.207
Arasaka's bitter rival.

13:11.290 --> 13:15.294
Megacorps offer the most lucrative
contracts. That's no great secret.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.546
Do you foresee a problem with this?

13:18.714 --> 13:21.717
-Not at all.
-That's what I like to hear.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.637
There's a contract
I'd like you to take over.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.722
It should seem familiar.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.058
You talking about Tanaka,
the data heist gig?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.684
I received a report

13:30.768 --> 13:34.146
-that Tanaka posess no relevant data.
-Yeah.

13:34.230 --> 13:38.108
But I also learned how you
managed to pierce Arasaka's ICE.

13:38.192 --> 13:42.238
A new netrunner on the crew cracked it.
And without Kiwi's help.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.574
True. Our crew has had
some luck with runners lately.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.577
Excellent. However,
I hear she's gone dark.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.081
<i>Yeah. Been taking a break</i>
<i>since that gig.</i>

13:52.164 --> 13:55.584
<i>But why?</i>
<i>Such a waste of talent, potential.</i>

13:56.210 --> 13:57.837
Her heart's just not in it.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.090
I suggest you give her a nudge
in the right direction.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.467
Easier said than done. Huh?

14:05.553 --> 14:09.265
But Arasaka knows Militech's
after them. Ain't that right?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.474
Them and everyone else.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.853
So, what's Militech after
that they'd risk such a ballsy move?

14:14.603 --> 14:18.232
That is for me to know.
It is certainly no concern of yours.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.735
Unneeded details also muddy the mind.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.737
Learn anything new that might help us?

14:23.821 --> 14:27.741
I'm afraid not. But good things
come to those who act.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.370
First, prove you're worth my time.

14:41.755 --> 14:42.631
You're home.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.595
Pretty late.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.723
Got a little caught up.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.517
Victory lap at Minjung's?

14:53.601 --> 14:54.476
Hm-mmm.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.437
Any hiccups today?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.731
We did lose someone, yeah.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.065
Who?

15:00.149 --> 15:02.401
Rookie solo. Wakako's.

15:02.484 --> 15:05.404
But everything else
went alright?

15:05.487 --> 15:08.824
Nothing tricky.
Kid just got excited. Hasty.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.285
Now, why does that sound familiar?

15:11.368 --> 15:12.912
Watch it.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.624
-Hey.
-Hmm?

15:16.707 --> 15:19.001
Landed something pretty big for us today.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.628
Sounds like fun.

15:20.711 --> 15:24.256
So, uhm, have you considered
coming back to the crew?

15:24.340 --> 15:27.426
Two netrunners on one team
sounds like a crowd.

15:27.509 --> 15:30.471
Lucy, we both know I'd always
rather have you around.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.431
-Please, David.
-Huh?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.934
I just need a little more time.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.938
Of course. No problem.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.565
More diving today?

15:42.316 --> 15:43.400
Hm-mmm.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.444
Buy a runnersuit, why don't you.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.071
Don't need one.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.365
Should get you
a new chair at least.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.825
That ice bath can't be comfy.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.746
Thanks, but never liked
chairs, suits.

15:55.829 --> 15:56.705
Oh.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.666
Sorry. Didn't know that.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.714
-David?
-Huh?

16:06.423 --> 16:07.716
Come on.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.134
Uhâ€¦

16:15.099 --> 16:17.393
Whoa! Look at all those stars!

16:17.476 --> 16:19.436
Can't get a view like this in the city.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.563
Maybe I'll catch one.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.357
You're lucky you're cute.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.275
Sure wish the moon was out.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.612
You can see the stars better, brighter,
when it's stays away.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.738
Really?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.408
Really, really. The moon outshines 'em.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.910
Are you sure you went to Arasaka Academy?

16:34.994 --> 16:38.122
-I'm dropped out, remember?
-Ah, right.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.917
You know, I've never been
outside the city before.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.127
Is that right?

16:44.169 --> 16:47.381
But you have had a life
outside Night City once?

16:50.801 --> 16:54.346
Looks like a prison from here.
A cage of light.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.601
Might not rememberâ€¦

16:59.685 --> 17:01.020
Hmm?

17:01.103 --> 17:03.814
Said once you and I were
worlds apart.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.066
Yeah.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.651
What'd you mean by that?

17:11.196 --> 17:12.364
Rather not say?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.493
You'd rather not hear.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.788
It's justâ€¦
I'd like to know more about you.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.544
<i>Arasaka.</i>

17:25.627 --> 17:27.296
-<i>Arasaka?</i>
-<i>Yup.</i>

17:28.047 --> 17:29.923
<i>I was born in another country,</i>

17:30.007 --> 17:32.051
<i>raised in an Arasaka facility.</i>

17:32.885 --> 17:34.219
<i>There were 13 of us.</i>

17:34.303 --> 17:38.557
<i>Kids who passed a proficiency test</i>
<i>were tagged to become netrunners.</i>

17:39.516 --> 17:42.311
<i>Kids who wouldn't be missed anywhere else.</i>

17:42.394 --> 17:46.648
<i>"We'll serve the world's most powerful</i>
<i>megacorp one day."</i>

17:46.732 --> 17:51.320
<i>That dream got us through</i>
<i>the toughest days, the toughest training.</i>

17:51.403 --> 17:55.699
<i>Its the dream we were given.</i>
<i>A dream we never questioned.</i>

17:55.783 --> 17:58.535
<i>One day, training was done.</i>

17:58.619 --> 18:02.164
<i>We expected corp assignments</i>
<i>the world over.</i>

18:02.247 --> 18:05.209
<i>Instead, they moved us underground.</i>

18:05.292 --> 18:09.630
<i>And day in, day out,</i>
<i>they forced us to dive.</i>

18:09.713 --> 18:12.257
<i>Old Net's where they sent us.</i>

18:12.341 --> 18:13.842
Wait. The Old Net?

18:13.926 --> 18:18.597
But I thought that whole system collapsed
something like 50 years ago, didn't it?

18:18.680 --> 18:22.768
Brought down by history's greatest
netrunner, creator of daemons.

18:22.851 --> 18:27.189
He was a true savant, super hacker,
legend Rache Bartmoss.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.774
Oh, shit, yeah.

18:28.857 --> 18:32.778
That guy corrupted like 78 percent
of the global net in single day.

18:32.861 --> 18:37.407
<i>Hm-mmm.</i>
<i>DataKrash virus shattered cyberspace.</i>

18:37.491 --> 18:41.203
<i>Broke the Net into a scattered mosaic</i>
<i>of isolated localnets.</i>

18:41.286 --> 18:44.456
<i>Connection severed, data lost.</i>
<i>It was chaos.</i>

18:45.415 --> 18:48.377
<i>Arasaka's purpose</i>
<i>lies somewhere in the Old Net.</i>

18:48.460 --> 18:51.922
<i>They're searching for legacy info,</i>
<i>lost knowledge.</i>

18:52.005 --> 18:57.302
<i>All of us kids, we were soldiers sent into</i>
<i>a nest of daemons and.</i>

18:58.470 --> 19:02.099
<i>Only an advanced runner can interface</i>
<i>using their whole mind.</i>

19:02.182 --> 19:03.600
<i>A deep-dive.</i>

19:03.684 --> 19:07.437
<i>It gives shape and form</i>
<i>to cyberspace, a way to traverse it.</i>

19:07.521 --> 19:10.440
<i>But whenever we uncovered</i>
<i>any rare data cacheâ€¦</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:17.614
<i>â€¦Rogue AIs would find us and swarm.</i>

19:20.117 --> 19:22.703
<i>We were picked off one by one.</i>

19:23.704 --> 19:28.750
<i>More empty chairs after each dive.</i>
<i>And my hope, each dive would be my last.</i>

19:28.834 --> 19:31.211
<i>Wasn't long before there were only</i>
<i>a handful of us left.</i>

19:32.838 --> 19:37.050
<i>We were chasing someone else's dream,</i>
<i>throwing down our lives to do it.</i>

19:37.134 --> 19:41.597
<i>So we realized, "If we're goners,</i>
<i>why not die chasing our own dream?"</i>

19:42.806 --> 19:45.184
<i>The tech staff didn't stand a chance.</i>

19:45.267 --> 19:47.477
<i>Not in the face of the skills</i>
<i>they'd taught us.</i>

19:58.572 --> 20:00.574
<i>I ran and ran.</i>

20:00.657 --> 20:02.492
<i>Heard shots, my friend's screams.</i>

20:03.493 --> 20:05.078
<i>But I never looked back.</i>

20:13.086 --> 20:16.423
<i>Next clear memory I have</i>
<i>is of a junkyard.</i>

20:17.591 --> 20:20.510
<i>Home, I guess.</i>
<i>But I was too scared to stay long.</i>

20:21.428 --> 20:23.764
<i>I roamed, place to place.</i>

20:25.974 --> 20:29.519
<i>But there's no place like Night City</i>
<i>if you wanna hide.</i>

20:30.145 --> 20:32.522
And even now,
still feel like they're chasing you?

20:33.106 --> 20:35.234
Not really, I guess.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.277
Maybe I've just grown
too comfortable here.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.656
Or maybe I've grown used to being scared.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.617
Your hand.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.286
It's nothing. It'll be fine in a sec.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.165
Haven't changed, have you?
Still chasing someone else's dream.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.297
It's not like I don't understand.

21:00.634 --> 21:05.305
Just thatâ€¦ that things are different now.
Can't be afraid for myself anymore.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.432
Only if you're now isâ€¦

21:08.100 --> 21:08.934
Someday, you'llâ€¦

21:18.610 --> 21:22.239
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>I managed to retrieve most of the data.</i>

21:22.322 --> 21:24.825
<i>But the vital's file</i>
<i>for one of the test subjects</i>

21:24.908 --> 21:26.743
<i>was completely corrupted.</i>

21:27.786 --> 21:30.289
<i>Yes. Manipulated deliberately.</i>

21:30.372 --> 21:32.708
<i>No trace in the ICE. No.</i>

21:32.791 --> 21:34.543
<i>But this level of precision,</i>

21:34.626 --> 21:37.212
<i>well, there's only a handful</i>
<i>of netrunners capable of it.</i>

21:38.964 --> 21:42.759
<i>No. I don't believe that.</i>
<i>Tanaka had no reason to do so.</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:47.180
<i>My assumption. His system</i>
<i>was breached when he was captured.</i>

21:47.264 --> 21:50.017
<i>Understood.</i>
<i>I'll do what I can do to restore it.</i>

21:51.226 --> 21:52.269
<i>Goodbye.</i>
