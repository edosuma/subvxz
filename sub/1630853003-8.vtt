00:25.291 --> 00:27.041
Around about
the birth of Christ,

00:27.125 --> 00:30.416
the Romans came up
with the concept of the mile.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.666
It's the distance covered
by a thousand paces
of a Roman Legion.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.250
That empire falls,

00:36.333 --> 00:38.333
bunch of other ones
pop up in its place,

00:38.416 --> 00:41.666
but for 2,000 years
of human history,

00:43.541 --> 00:46.666
people everywhere believed
the same damn thing.

00:46.750 --> 00:50.208
That no human being
can run that distance

00:50.291 --> 00:52.416
in less than four minutes.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.791
Ain't gonna happen.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.125
Impossible.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.208
God, I hate that fucking word.

00:59.291 --> 01:01.708
And it's a good thing
I'm not the only one.

01:01.791 --> 01:04.416
- So one day, this skinny
kid in England

01:04.500 --> 01:06.458
says he's gonna
take a crack at it.

01:06.541 --> 01:08.291
<i>Now, there are</i>
<i>crummy conditions.</i>

01:08.375 --> 01:11.750
Wind, rain, a muddy track.
They all say he's nuts,

01:11.833 --> 01:14.916
which is exactly what
they've been telling me lately.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.291
But there he was,

01:16.375 --> 01:19.083
just like me,
running straight into the wind.

01:20.666 --> 01:21.833
And after about three laps,

01:21.916 --> 01:24.833
that skinny Brit was
starting to lose faith.

01:26.583 --> 01:29.791
Starting to wonder if
maybe everybody was right.

01:29.875 --> 01:32.875
<i>Maybe it just</i>
<i>could not be done.</i>

01:32.958 --> 01:35.916
But just as he was
rounding the corner,

01:36.000 --> 01:37.750
on that final stretch...

01:38.416 --> 01:39.333
he heard a roar.

01:41.958 --> 01:44.541
The crowd screaming
for him to keep going,

01:44.625 --> 01:46.958
filling his sails
with a second wind,

01:47.041 --> 01:48.750
and he crossed that finish line

01:48.833 --> 01:52.041
<i>at 3 minutes, 59.4 seconds.</i>

01:54.875 --> 01:58.208
<i>And in that instant,</i>
<i>a skinny Limey</i>

01:58.291 --> 02:00.375
shattered everything
we thought we knew

02:00.458 --> 02:02.916
about human limitation.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.125
But why him?

02:04.208 --> 02:06.333
<i>He wasn't the fastest</i>
<i>runner in the world.</i>

02:06.416 --> 02:07.708
He wasn't even
a professional.

02:07.791 --> 02:09.083
He was a scientist.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.666
A doctor of neurology.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.708
And that's how he knew

02:13.791 --> 02:14.875
that the only real limitation

02:14.958 --> 02:17.208
wasn't in the body.

02:17.291 --> 02:18.833
It was in the mind.

02:23.458 --> 02:26.666
Two thousand years since
the invention of the mile,

02:26.750 --> 02:29.333
and nobody ran it faster
than four minutes

02:29.416 --> 02:31.916
until Roger Bannister.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.708
Guess how long it took
the next guy to do it?

02:35.625 --> 02:37.666
Forty-six days.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.916
And you remember
his name, right?

02:40.750 --> 02:42.125
No?

02:42.208 --> 02:44.208
Yeah, me neither.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.708
Congratulations on making
the All-Star team.

04:35.791 --> 04:37.958
- Thank you.
- First rookie starter
since Elvin Hayes.

04:38.041 --> 04:40.041
Oh, word?
Me and the Big E, huh?

04:40.125 --> 04:42.875
- Top vote-getter
right here, baby.
- New poll coming tomorrow.

04:42.958 --> 04:45.125
Have you seen? Of your fellow
current players in the league,

04:45.208 --> 04:48.708
only 10 said they'd have
picked you as an All-Star.

04:48.791 --> 04:51.333
I mean, that's got to sting
a little, doesn't it?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.250
Nah.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.833
I'm still a rook.

04:54.916 --> 04:56.458
Them old heads,
they ain't even see me play yet.

04:56.541 --> 04:59.166
Nineteen of them picked
Larry Bird.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.458
Yeah?

05:02.458 --> 05:06.375
I guess that just mean that
the fans know what's really up.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.583
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.000
Ten votes?

05:27.250 --> 05:29.958
Oh, shit. Oh!

05:30.041 --> 05:31.875
Better get that looked at.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.541
I saw you limping out there.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.416
This, Coach, this ain't nothin'.

05:38.916 --> 05:41.958
- It's all good.
I know my body.
- Yeah?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.875
Maybe you know how to ignore it.

05:45.833 --> 05:48.083
- Hm.
- Trust me, Spence.

05:51.666 --> 05:55.166
I've been there.
Give that a squeeze.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.416
- Damn.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.000
Spence, this was me
"knowing my body."

06:01.083 --> 06:03.708
Okay? This was me
telling Coach,

06:03.791 --> 06:05.416
"Don't worry about the limp.
It's nothing."

06:05.500 --> 06:07.375
'Cause I didn't wanna
lose my minutes.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.375
But, I'll tell you
what I know now.

06:11.375 --> 06:14.500
We can't make it all the way
without what you give this team.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.666
You putting in the dirty work,
coming off the bench.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.875
I know that's not what
you wanna be doin' here.

06:20.958 --> 06:23.166
But we need that
from you right now.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.750
And we need you healthy,

06:25.833 --> 06:27.833
so we can get you one of these.

06:27.916 --> 06:30.750
- Yeah, it ain't no thing
without the ring.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.916
So, I want you to talk to Curran
and get that knee evaluated.

06:37.166 --> 06:40.291
- And take it easy if
you have to. Alright.
- Alright.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.500
Hey! Let's bring it in.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.125
- Alright.
- Drumroll!

06:44.208 --> 06:46.833
Oh...

06:47.500 --> 06:48.875
Oh shit! Oh!

06:48.958 --> 06:52.250
Okay. First place,
motherfuckers!

06:54.166 --> 06:56.125
What's Shakespeare got
to say about that, Coach?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.166
Ah, good question, Norman.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.500
The Bard says...

07:00.583 --> 07:03.500
- Let's not get cocky.
- Is Shakespeare still alive?

07:03.583 --> 07:05.750
We need 20 more to win the West.

07:05.833 --> 07:08.500
And our friends in Boston--
fuck Boston--

07:09.833 --> 07:11.000
are not loafing.

07:12.916 --> 07:15.833
If we keep playing
like we're playing,

07:15.916 --> 07:17.708
there is a championship

07:17.791 --> 07:19.208
within our grasp.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.291
Uh-huh.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.791
So, I want you to dwell on that
on your days off.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.208
But first, I wanna leave
you with something.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.333
- No, no, no, no, no.
You're gonna...

07:28.416 --> 07:30.875
- You're gonna like--

07:30.958 --> 07:32.791
Just give me a chance.
This is a good one.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.000
"Blow, winds,

07:39.166 --> 07:40.875
and crack your cheeks."

07:40.958 --> 07:43.666
- What the fuck?

07:43.750 --> 07:45.000
<i>Et tu,</i> Pat?!

07:45.083 --> 07:47.958
Oh, I warned you, Paul!
I warned you! I warned you!

07:51.625 --> 07:54.625
- You missed a spot!
- Coach!

07:54.708 --> 07:58.083
- Wow, Coach, look at you!
- Oh, shit.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.750
Good to see you back
in fighting form.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.750
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.583
- Hey, Jack.
- Hi, Jack.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.333
Sorry about the Dixie Cups.

08:12.416 --> 08:14.458
Become something
of a tradition.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.375
- To 31.
- Cheers.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.541
Don't you mean 40?

08:23.833 --> 08:25.083
Yeah, of course.

08:25.166 --> 08:26.375
It's just--
This is just...

08:26.458 --> 08:28.916
This is sort of our own...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.708
Oh, right.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.750
Well, you're lookin' spry.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.125
Tell it to my doctors.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.541
Yeah? They're, uh...

08:43.625 --> 08:45.541
They're telling you
you should take it slower or...

08:45.625 --> 08:48.250
If it were up to them,
I'd be coaching from my La-Z-Boy

08:48.333 --> 08:50.041
for the rest of my life.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.541
Which reminds me,
whose bright idea was it

08:53.625 --> 08:55.625
to bury Haywood
on the bench?

08:55.708 --> 08:58.041
It was, uh...

08:58.125 --> 09:00.041
Uh, Jack, after you left,

09:00.125 --> 09:03.083
- Haywood, um--
- He was a problem.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.916
And you solve that
by taking away his minutes?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.583
Making him a punching bag?

09:07.666 --> 09:09.916
Man can put up 15 points a game.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.166
I want him in his rhythm
by the playoffs.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.375
Okay...

09:15.416 --> 09:17.750
Well, actually, uh, Jack,

09:17.833 --> 09:21.291
we, uh, we think we might
be better off without him.

09:21.375 --> 09:22.875
I mean, he's been
playing through it,

09:22.958 --> 09:24.625
but that knee's pretty beat.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.750
You know, he might not even
make it through the playoffs.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.875
You know, but if he's strong
enough to pass a physical,

09:29.958 --> 09:32.416
word is that, uh,

09:32.500 --> 09:34.666
Detroit might part with McAdoo.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.666
Is that your grand plan?

09:38.750 --> 09:39.916
Hey, uh, listen, obviously,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.583
we wouldn't make
a move without you.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.416
- Without, uh,
talking to you first.
- Oh.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.750
Look I mean,
Haywood's a good guy.

09:47.833 --> 09:48.875
I mean, he's a great player,

09:48.958 --> 09:50.791
but, you know,
his prime's in the rear-view.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.041
McAdoo is an All-Star,

09:52.125 --> 09:54.166
and we can't pass that up.
That's a win.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.875
He's not right for the system.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.291
Get Spencer
in the starting five.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.208
I want to see that unit
against Philly.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.833
I mean, of course. Yeah.
I'll get you film--

10:02.916 --> 10:04.666
No need. I'll be there.

10:04.750 --> 10:07.541
Starting next week,
I'm traveling with the team.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.375
Excuse me, Pat.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.958
- Well...

<i>a game-winning basket...</i>

10:59.750 --> 11:01.041
Hey.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.750
That was my fault in there.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.666
Pat and I have a repartee.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.458
Uh, he's a passionate guy,

11:10.541 --> 11:12.458
but he-he's a loyal soldier,
and he'll...

11:12.541 --> 11:14.208
he'll slide down the bench,
no problem.

11:14.291 --> 11:15.625
He won't have to.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.875
Jack, what are
you talking about?

11:18.958 --> 11:21.416
He's not coming with us.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.666
He left his job.

11:26.958 --> 11:30.875
- Jack, I promised him
he'd have a spot.
- I didn't.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.375
The second I'm back
on that bench,

11:33.458 --> 11:35.666
I'm under a microscope.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.625
Everybody looking for
a reason I'm not ready.

11:38.708 --> 11:42.375
You're the only one I trust
to watch my back, Paul.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.208
Family only.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.375
- When do we tell Pat?
- Whenever you want.

11:52.916 --> 11:55.791
But I'd do it
sooner than later.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.291
Shouldn't be too long
before the doctors clear me.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.041
You ought to give him time
to find a landing pad.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.250
Okay.

12:18.833 --> 12:21.041
Oh, for God's sakes.

12:21.125 --> 12:23.916
I have broken out of
weaker cuffs than this!

12:25.416 --> 12:27.583
Oh, I'm worn out.

12:27.666 --> 12:29.291
Grandma, Grandma,

12:29.375 --> 12:31.458
here, let me-- D-don't--
that's littering!

12:31.541 --> 12:34.958
- Grandma.
- Goodness sakes, that's
the least of my problems.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.541
- And I need-- I need that.
- No, you don't.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.208
- No, you don't.
It's a straight shot.
- You're going to get us killed.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.875
I need a blot.
I need a blot. Lean in.

12:40.958 --> 12:43.375
- You're gonna kill us.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.708
Blend that in.
You're paler than I am,

12:45.791 --> 12:47.458
and I've got one foot
in the grave.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.166
You gotta stop
talking like that.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.791
You're out of the woods.
You beat this thing.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.541
Well...

12:53.625 --> 12:56.250
that's our story,
and we're stickin' to it.

12:57.875 --> 13:02.291
- What?
- Jeanie, pick a direction.

13:02.375 --> 13:06.000
Either act like you don't want
to know or ask me flat-out.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.750
Know what?
The fluid is out of your lungs,

13:08.833 --> 13:10.250
and they're sending you home.

13:14.416 --> 13:16.416
I mean, they wouldn't
do that unless--

13:16.500 --> 13:18.208
Unless I told them to.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.791
I told them I refused
to kick the bucket

13:20.875 --> 13:24.000
under fluorescent lights. Ah!

13:24.083 --> 13:27.041
I'm going out like Cleopatra

13:27.125 --> 13:29.791
with a great wig
and a stiff drink.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.666
- Maybe we can find an asp.
- I'm sorry,

13:31.750 --> 13:34.250
what are you telling me right
now? What are you saying?

13:41.208 --> 13:43.708
They drained the fluid
from my lungs, yes,

13:43.791 --> 13:47.083
but that's not all that's
in there and everywhere.

13:47.916 --> 13:49.541
And it ain't goin' away.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.458
But, they can't just give up
though. Dad wouldn't let them.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.500
Gerald doesn't know.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.916
And that's precisely the way
we need to keep it.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.125
Do you understand?

14:02.625 --> 14:04.250
Jeanie...

14:04.333 --> 14:07.250
- Sweetie, come on, now. Come on.
- I ca-- I can't...

14:07.333 --> 14:10.500
- I can't lie to him.
- Well, of course, you can!

14:10.583 --> 14:12.375
You do it every day.

14:12.458 --> 14:15.750
You see exactly
who he is. The act,

14:15.833 --> 14:19.208
the girls. The rat's nest
on top of his head.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.833
That's what it is
to love a man.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.166
They're weak, they're feeble.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.333
They need the show.

14:29.416 --> 14:31.166
- Hey!

14:31.250 --> 14:32.666
Oh!

14:32.750 --> 14:34.166
Good God in Heaven.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.041
Look at you.
You're fresh out of the slammer,

14:37.125 --> 14:38.583
you already look
like a million bucks!

14:38.666 --> 14:41.000
Well, I should. I'm sure
that's what it cost you.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.208
- You're worth
every penny.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.375
- Got you a little somethin'.
- Oh.

14:45.458 --> 14:46.583
Look!

14:46.666 --> 14:49.583
Warm champagne.
My very favorite.

14:49.666 --> 14:53.000
Jeanie, would you put
this on ice, honey? Yes.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.416
Hey, kid.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.166
Ma, this is
the new girl.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.750
Hello. I'm Lucía.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.541
Oh. Well,

15:00.625 --> 15:02.833
I hope you know how
to mix a stiff martini.

15:02.916 --> 15:06.333
I didn't cheat death
just to die of boredom.

15:06.416 --> 15:08.083
Up with an olive?

15:08.166 --> 15:10.000
Oh, two.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.166
I like this one.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.500
Well, my last patient
was particular.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.333
Always had to have
his nightcap,
right until the end.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.291
Well, there's not gonna
be any "end" to this job.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.125
It's nothing but martinis,
right, Ma?

15:22.208 --> 15:25.000
- Absolutely. Uh-huh.
- She's gonna
outlive us all.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.875
I got you a little something.

15:27.541 --> 15:28.666
Oh, dear.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.916
Actually,
a big "little something."

15:31.000 --> 15:33.666
'Cause you can't watch
the All-Star Game
in black and white!

15:35.083 --> 15:36.333
Look at that.

15:39.958 --> 15:41.916
So this is it.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.041
These are the All-Stars.

15:44.125 --> 15:47.708
They told me you are
America's best.

15:47.791 --> 15:50.833
But alls I see is
America's beasts.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.666
It's a different generation.

16:06.291 --> 16:09.625
- Ain't that Dr. J?
- Quit looking, girl.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.333
Why not? Had that damn
face staring at me

16:12.416 --> 16:14.375
from all those
posters in your room.

16:14.458 --> 16:17.166
Imagine what he saw you do.

16:17.250 --> 16:20.833
Well, we big-time now,
so just play it cool.

16:20.916 --> 16:22.708
You play it cool
all you want.

16:22.791 --> 16:25.291
You said you wanted me here
to be real with you.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.250
Hm? And, for real...

16:28.583 --> 16:31.458
This is pretty neat.

16:31.541 --> 16:32.750
- It is that.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.583
Glad you could make it.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.375
Been missin' you.

16:37.916 --> 16:39.708
How bad?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.458
- What you mean?
- Told you about

16:41.541 --> 16:43.750
that job I applied for
in Detroit?

16:43.833 --> 16:44.916
What, you got it?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.958
Mine if I want it.

16:47.041 --> 16:50.666
Good shit, Cook! All that
lookin' foxy paying off.

16:50.750 --> 16:55.041
Thing is, they're starting up
a new branch in LA.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.333
Detroit it is.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.083
- Nah, nah--
- I know that look, Earvin.

17:02.166 --> 17:05.500
Nah, I want you to. I do.

17:08.916 --> 17:12.041
There's the young brother
I'm dying to see.
Earvin Magic.

17:14.125 --> 17:17.291
<i>Julius Irving...!</i>

17:17.375 --> 17:18.958
<i> Ooh!</i>

17:19.041 --> 17:20.708
Doc!

17:20.791 --> 17:22.833
Told you last time,
my friends call me Julius.

17:22.916 --> 17:26.125
We might as well be friendly.
Everybody sayin'
you the next me.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.750
Nah, man. Never that.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.125
Dr. Johnson guarded by Dr. J.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.000
He's been giving him
problems all night.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.125
Makes his move!

17:34.208 --> 17:35.625
Bam! Oh!

17:35.708 --> 17:39.958
Dr. Johnson with
the house call! Woo!

17:40.041 --> 17:41.833
And, uh, this lovely lady?

17:42.750 --> 17:44.833
Oh!

17:44.916 --> 17:46.375
This my, uh...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.583
This Cookie.

17:49.666 --> 17:51.875
- Earleatha Kelly.
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Kelly.

17:51.958 --> 17:55.041
- We're having a little soiree
in the room after the game.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.125
You and your beau
should stop on by.

17:58.791 --> 18:00.791
- - Earvin/
- Yeah! Okay!
- Okay.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.041
Uh-oh, don't look now.
Here come Yogi and Boo-Boo.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.750
Eh, what's up, Doc?

18:05.833 --> 18:07.708
- Mr. Commissioner.

18:07.791 --> 18:10.875
- What's shakin', David?
- Always a pleasure, Julius.

18:10.958 --> 18:13.416
Doc, let me buy you a drink!

18:13.500 --> 18:15.333
See you on the floor,
young blood.

18:15.416 --> 18:17.333
We're hitting the buffet.

18:17.416 --> 18:19.708
Two things in this league
vanish if you blink--

18:19.791 --> 18:22.958
marriages
and shrimp cocktails.

18:23.041 --> 18:24.208
The Commissioner and I
were hoping

18:24.291 --> 18:26.375
you'd have time for
a bite after the game.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.750
Talk about the future of
the league with our...

18:28.833 --> 18:30.416
two most exciting rookies.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.083
Two...

18:33.708 --> 18:35.458
Right...

18:35.541 --> 18:38.125
Looking forward to it, Earvin.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.583
Right on.
Me, too. Me, too.

18:40.666 --> 18:42.666
You know, it's fun
watching you out there.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.000
Looks like you're
having a blast.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.416
Only way the Magic Man
know how to play.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.208
Well, thank goodness for that.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.916
That smile is contagious.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.375
Wanna know a secret?

18:51.458 --> 18:53.041
Well, well, well,
Zeke, that is one

18:53.125 --> 18:55.041
happy motherfucker
right there.

18:55.125 --> 18:58.791
Huh? Unlike you,
you miserable fuckin' prick.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.791
You didn't know
how to be happy even
when we fuckin' won.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.000
Yeah? Fuck you, too.

19:10.666 --> 19:13.958
Shit. Fucking hand,
I swear to God,

19:14.041 --> 19:15.458
I'm gonna fuckin'...

19:15.541 --> 19:16.500
Fuck.

19:23.416 --> 19:26.000
Welcome to the 1980
NBA All-Star game...

19:26.083 --> 19:28.583
- Let's get ready!
- ...on CBS, live from
Landover, Maryland.

19:28.666 --> 19:31.833
<i>- Where East meets West</i>
<i>for basketball supremacy.</i>
- Alright, here we go!

19:31.916 --> 19:35.583
Let's go, Kareem!
That's crazy.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.375
<i>...Dr. J, Dr. J</i>
<i>charging up court,</i>

19:43.458 --> 19:44.791
<i>and he's up and--</i>

19:46.166 --> 19:48.041
Ooh!

19:48.125 --> 19:50.000
- Ooh, shit!

19:50.083 --> 19:51.458
That's embarrassing.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.083
Doc just put that
Statue of Liberty on Cap.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.625
God bless America.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.666
Kareem about to be
a surly motherfucker.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.166
Hey! Language,
language, language.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.666
Don't make me bust out
the swear jar.

20:02.750 --> 20:03.875
Too late for that, Coach.

20:03.958 --> 20:06.041
Spence got mama's
titties on the wall.

20:06.125 --> 20:10.375
- Body ain't nothin'
to be ashamed of, man.
- Not one like that.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.625
Alright, somebody
wants to make

20:12.708 --> 20:14.750
another trip to the jungle gym.

20:14.833 --> 20:17.708
Spence, walk with us,
please, will ya?

20:17.791 --> 20:20.458
Okay, you lead the way,
sweetheart. Here we go.

20:21.958 --> 20:23.916
Here we go. Watch your step.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.583
Did he say anything else?

20:29.666 --> 20:31.458
Who?

20:31.541 --> 20:33.041
What? Jack.

20:33.125 --> 20:37.083
Like what our roles will be
once he comes back.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.750
I mean, there's not
a lot of other teams out there

20:39.833 --> 20:41.375
with two assistants, right?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.958
- So, I'm just wondering
how he sees it.
- Right.

20:45.708 --> 20:48.541
Um, he didn't really
say anything, so...

20:49.625 --> 20:51.833
I'm sure we're
gonna feel it out.

20:55.958 --> 20:59.250
- Are you good?
- Yeah. I have to hit
the head.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.958
- Here we go.
- I am so sorry

21:17.041 --> 21:19.291
- about the Chinese finger trap.
- You kidding?

21:19.375 --> 21:21.458
With handles like these,

21:21.541 --> 21:23.541
- she might be battling
you for minutes.
- Well,

21:23.625 --> 21:25.541
I ain't got too many
of them to lose.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.791
Now, I ain't
complaining, Coach.

21:28.875 --> 21:31.291
You looking at a humble man.
I just-- I'll do anything

21:31.375 --> 21:34.208
to win, you know.
I want my little girl

21:34.291 --> 21:36.416
inheriting a ring.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.791
That case, I'm gonna
need more out of you.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.291
I'm talking scoring,
minutes...

21:42.375 --> 21:44.208
Come playoffs,
I want you to be prepared

21:44.291 --> 21:47.125
to carry more
of the offensive load.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.666
I'm surprised to hear that
because the Professor and Riles

21:49.750 --> 21:51.375
got me thinkin' defense first.

21:51.458 --> 21:52.875
That's them.

21:52.958 --> 21:56.166
I'm coming back now,
and they know the new deal.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.250
We're gonna get you ramped up.

21:58.333 --> 22:01.916
And I don't want you worried
about these rumors either.

22:02.666 --> 22:04.000
Rumors?

22:04.083 --> 22:07.666
About McAdoo and all
this trade baloney.

22:07.750 --> 22:11.041
I want you to know your
place here is secure, okay?

22:12.541 --> 22:14.125
Yeah. Cool.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.833
That's good to know.

22:26.458 --> 22:29.583
- Woo!

22:32.666 --> 22:35.583
<i>Halftime at</i>
<i>the NBA All-Star Game.</i>

22:35.666 --> 22:37.083
<i>Tied score</i>

22:37.166 --> 22:39.291
<i>and what a sensational</i>
<i>performance</i>

22:39.375 --> 22:41.166
<i>from rookies</i>
<i>Magic Johnson</i>

22:41.250 --> 22:43.041
<i>and Larry Bird.</i>

22:43.125 --> 22:45.916
Gerald, your new toys
are very pretty,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.041
but could we please switch
the channel to "Dynasty"?

22:49.125 --> 22:50.541
I need to see what's happening.

22:50.625 --> 22:53.041
This is the newest
dynasty right here!

22:53.125 --> 22:55.375
Come on, Ma, us!

22:55.458 --> 22:57.750
Hey, hon, will you
get me a refill?

22:57.833 --> 22:59.458
- Come on.
- Me, me, me, me, me.

22:59.541 --> 23:02.166
And "me, me," too, here.
Me, me.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.791
This guy can't make
a free throw to save his life.

23:06.875 --> 23:10.458
- Which one is yours?
Any of them?
- Kareem and Magic.

23:10.541 --> 23:13.333
The tall one and--
The two tall ones.

23:13.416 --> 23:15.833
Here you go, sweetie,
thank you.

23:17.125 --> 23:19.375
They need the show.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.250
- Right here, honey.
- Sure, why not?

23:23.333 --> 23:26.166
Thank you, sweetie.
Ooh! Careful! Mm!

23:27.583 --> 23:30.708
Mm. The Colonel has arrived!

23:30.791 --> 23:33.666
Ma, what do you like?
Breast? Thigh?

23:33.750 --> 23:35.416
You tell me,
you're the connoisseur.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.416
- Well, I like 69,
but to each their own.

23:41.041 --> 23:45.166
Mm... Mm...

23:45.250 --> 23:49.000
I don't know why anybody
makes chicken themselves.

23:49.083 --> 23:52.666
Come on, kid, dig in there!
Get some of that chicken,
Jeanie.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.791
- Oh, well...

24:07.875 --> 24:09.500
You okay, sweetie?

24:10.708 --> 24:12.083
It was the Champagne?

24:12.916 --> 24:14.208
Uh-huh!

24:14.291 --> 24:16.708
Clearly, she's got
her mother's stomach.

24:16.791 --> 24:18.458
It's okay. Just...
Just get me the club soda.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.541
I'll clean it up.
Just get the club soda...

24:20.625 --> 24:23.583
- Mostly in the bucket. That's
the good news and the bad news.
- I got this.

24:23.666 --> 24:26.500
I'll clean it up.
Ah, crap.

24:26.583 --> 24:28.833
It's stuck. Stupid jewels!

24:28.916 --> 24:32.000
Okay, it's okay.
It's okay. I got it.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.000
Hand me the club soda, will you?

24:34.083 --> 24:35.541
- Just hand me the club soda!
- Here, here, here.

24:35.625 --> 24:38.791
- Like this.

24:38.875 --> 24:43.000
- Right there. Ooh.
- <i> ...Larry Bird</i>
<i>and Magic Johnson spar.</i>

24:43.083 --> 24:45.416
<i>Neither one is backing down</i>
<i>from the fight,</i>

24:45.500 --> 24:46.875
<i>that's for sure.</i>

24:46.958 --> 24:49.916
<i>- Lucky Larry Bird puts</i>
<i>the East over the top</i>

24:50.000 --> 24:52.833
<i>with the first-ever</i>
<i>three-point shot</i>

24:52.916 --> 24:55.125
<i>in an NBA All-Star Game.</i>

24:55.208 --> 24:56.333
'Course they found
a way to get

24:56.416 --> 24:58.000
that white boy three
for chucking up a prayer.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.083
Whoa, easy on
the white boy, huh?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.833
Dunks should be
worth three, man.

25:01.916 --> 25:03.250
Damn sight harder.

25:03.333 --> 25:06.000
Shit, Doc's slams
should've been worth five.

25:15.416 --> 25:16.666
Ain't that right, Wood?

25:19.166 --> 25:20.791
Wood!

25:22.041 --> 25:24.875
- Wood!
- Hm?

25:24.958 --> 25:28.083
Let me put this baby away.
Come on, baby.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.666
I got you. Let's go.

25:47.708 --> 25:49.083
I understand. I understand.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.166
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.916
There she go.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
- What I do? Huh?

25:57.083 --> 25:58.791
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

26:09.625 --> 26:12.000
- Alright. Be safe.
- See ya.

26:15.666 --> 26:18.000
Oh, there he is!

26:18.083 --> 26:19.583
Spence...

26:19.666 --> 26:21.166
Appreciate the hospitality, man.

26:21.250 --> 26:24.083
Th-this was really
great for the team.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.458
- Yeah? What team's that?
- Yeah.

26:27.750 --> 26:30.708
- What?
- The one you trying
to trade me to?

26:32.375 --> 26:34.000
- What are you talking about?
- Man,

26:34.083 --> 26:37.208
here I am, thinkin'
you've been awful worried

26:37.291 --> 26:39.083
about me healing up.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.500
Now, I know you don't
give a fuck about me.

26:41.583 --> 26:44.000
- Just checking my teeth
for the auction block.
- Hold on a second.

26:44.083 --> 26:46.916
That's not what happened.
What-what...

26:47.000 --> 26:50.250
- Where'd you hear this?
- The fuck's it matter
if it's true?

26:50.333 --> 26:51.458
Huh?

26:51.541 --> 26:54.583
What, what fucking--
How does it fucking matter?

26:54.666 --> 26:56.250
You come here,
you drink my beer,

26:56.333 --> 26:57.791
you smile at my baby,

26:57.875 --> 26:59.041
and the whole damn time,

26:59.125 --> 27:00.791
the whole goddamn time,

27:00.875 --> 27:02.250
you planning on shipping me off!

27:02.333 --> 27:05.208
- Hey, Wood, that is not--
- Get the fuck outta my house!

27:05.875 --> 27:08.958
Take it easy.

27:09.041 --> 27:12.541
- Is he all right?
- Shit, man, does he
seem all right to you?

27:15.750 --> 27:18.791
He told Wood about
the fucking trade.

27:18.875 --> 27:20.625
Had to be Jack!

27:20.708 --> 27:23.791
Who else? Huh?
Fucking undermining us!

27:23.875 --> 27:26.166
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.166
Well, even if he did,
it's his prerogative.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.000
He's coaching his team.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.708
Yeah, since when?

27:31.791 --> 27:33.583
It's not his ass out
there on the line.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.125
It's us! Huh?

27:36.208 --> 27:38.333
We're the ones that just got
thrown into the fucking sea

27:38.416 --> 27:39.625
of dog shit!

27:39.708 --> 27:41.041
And you need to talk to him.

27:41.125 --> 27:43.583
And say what? Huh?
Tell him what?

27:44.416 --> 27:46.500
We work for him!

27:48.125 --> 27:50.750
We work for him.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.708
- He is coming back.
- Great.

27:52.791 --> 27:54.250
If I...

27:54.333 --> 27:57.375
If I were you,
I would not pick a fight.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.416
I would find a way to
make myself essential.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.000
Prove my worth.

28:03.041 --> 28:04.208
Prove my worth?

28:04.291 --> 28:06.916
I'm saying that we all knew
that this was temporary.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.416
Temporary is the first
fucking month.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.083
Two maybe!

28:12.791 --> 28:14.916
We coached 50 games!

28:16.208 --> 28:17.750
Fifty!

28:17.833 --> 28:19.750
You!

28:20.625 --> 28:22.500
- Still his team.
- Not anymore.

28:24.125 --> 28:26.541
It's your team. It's ours.

28:26.625 --> 28:29.750
You don't see the way
the guys look at you?

28:29.833 --> 28:32.791
Like you're their coach.

28:32.875 --> 28:35.125
- I would not be here
if it was not for Jack.
- Yeah?

28:35.208 --> 28:37.833
- Yeah.
- He wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for us.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.750
That's the truth.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.125
We saved his job, Paul.

28:41.208 --> 28:44.208
We made this the best team
in the fuckin' league.

28:44.291 --> 28:45.750
They're the best.

28:45.833 --> 28:49.125
- You want to walk away from--
- I don't have a fucking choice!

28:55.333 --> 28:56.625
We're lucky to be here.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.583
Not off grading papers.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.458
Not getting the fist from Chick.

29:03.541 --> 29:07.041
Just try not to forget it.
Okay?

29:08.291 --> 29:09.541
Yeah...

29:45.541 --> 29:48.416
Turns out this guy from Italy

29:48.500 --> 29:50.958
smuggled a home movie
back to Rome.

29:51.041 --> 29:53.708
- For real?
- Mm. You and Bird
in that Boston game,

29:53.791 --> 29:55.541
showing it in theaters.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.000
- I'm a movie star?

29:58.083 --> 29:59.458
Well, that's why we're here.

29:59.541 --> 30:03.333
Now, the commissioner sees an
opportunity for a new PR push.

30:03.416 --> 30:05.041
East versus West,

30:05.125 --> 30:06.666
city kid versus farm boy.

30:06.750 --> 30:08.958
Luke Skywalker
versus Darth Vader.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.166
That's the kind of
box office we want.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.250
Got the wrong Luke then.

30:13.333 --> 30:17.291
Larry got the whiteness,
but he ain't got the Force.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.500
Mumbling, mean-mugging.

30:20.916 --> 30:24.041
You need you...

30:24.125 --> 30:26.208
a Jedi.

30:28.375 --> 30:30.541
Then maybe we're on
to something special.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.458
Special enough for
Rookie of the Year?

30:34.166 --> 30:35.250
That got him, huh?

30:35.333 --> 30:38.458
The writers vote on
that award, of course.

30:38.541 --> 30:41.583
We don't control who wins.

30:41.666 --> 30:43.291
Yeah, you don't.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.375
But, you do...

30:46.458 --> 30:47.750
Just sayin'.

30:47.833 --> 30:50.208
Force strong
with Mr. Stern.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.541
Being a hero is
a full-time job.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.833
Quite a spotlight.

30:57.916 --> 31:01.208
Some youngsters in your shoes
can't help themselves

31:01.291 --> 31:03.416
and pick the Dark Side.

31:07.458 --> 31:09.083
That ain't Magic.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.625
Hiya, fellas!

31:11.708 --> 31:14.375
Look what the cat
dragged in!

31:21.458 --> 31:23.125
- Commissioner.
- Larry.

31:23.208 --> 31:26.458
- What's up, Larry? Good win.

31:26.541 --> 31:29.375
- Sweet shot at the end.
- I know.

31:29.458 --> 31:31.833
Too bad you ain't had
that back in Boston.

31:31.916 --> 31:33.333
Ooh!

31:36.625 --> 31:38.208
They got Bud here?

31:38.291 --> 31:40.500
Yeah, can we get a Bud
for this young man?

31:41.500 --> 31:43.208
Can he get that young man a Bud?

31:45.083 --> 31:46.458
Take a rum bun.

31:46.541 --> 31:49.416
Cook, you shoulda seen it!

31:49.500 --> 31:50.916
Had 'em right
where I wanted 'em!

31:51.000 --> 31:54.250
Bird ain't say shit
the whole night!

31:54.333 --> 31:56.208
Two league dudes
was all up on me

31:56.291 --> 31:57.291
like two white pigeons!

31:57.375 --> 31:59.291
What I tell you?
Only thing

31:59.375 --> 32:01.458
they like more than
one of they own is one of us

32:01.541 --> 32:03.708
that make 'em
feel comfortable.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.166
Ooh, you look good, girl.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.333
Rhonda called.

32:08.416 --> 32:10.416
Your, your friend Rhonda?

32:12.375 --> 32:14.041
Your friend, too!

32:14.125 --> 32:16.833
You hung out in Lansing.

32:16.916 --> 32:20.250
You weren't there.
I was being polite.

32:20.333 --> 32:23.750
Were you polite enough
to wear a rubber?

32:26.375 --> 32:29.125
- Okay. Okay. Aight.
We did our thing,

32:29.208 --> 32:32.125
but-but you was the one who said
you had something else to do!

32:32.208 --> 32:33.625
She's having your baby.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.041
Nah. Nah...

32:40.125 --> 32:42.708
Nah, Cook.
That ain't true! Come on!

32:42.791 --> 32:45.041
That ain't true! She lying!

32:45.125 --> 32:46.791
Cook, you know that ain't true!

32:46.875 --> 32:48.500
Dr. Day warned me
about all this shit!

32:48.583 --> 32:50.375
Once you got money, people
got a target on your back!

32:50.458 --> 32:53.875
- Come on!
You don't believe that!
- She is my friend!

32:53.958 --> 32:57.125
I see her at church!
At school!

33:00.416 --> 33:03.125
Now, I gotta walk around
and see her gettin'
bigger every week,

33:03.208 --> 33:05.208
with little Earvin Jr.
in her belly?

33:05.291 --> 33:07.708
- No! No!
- Cookie, there ain't
gonna be no Earvin Jr.!

33:07.791 --> 33:10.500
- Come on, Cook! We got Dr. J!

33:12.916 --> 33:14.208
Fuck!

33:19.083 --> 33:20.625
Earvin...

33:21.583 --> 33:22.833
If Cookie's still feeling sick,

33:22.916 --> 33:25.375
you tell her that I will
bring her some moonstone,

33:25.458 --> 33:27.083
some black tourmaline

33:27.166 --> 33:29.416
for the negativity,
because that's the thing

33:29.500 --> 33:32.083
that Western medicine
does not understand,

33:32.166 --> 33:34.333
it's that true healing,
real healing,

33:34.416 --> 33:36.291
it's not physical.
It's spiritual.

33:36.375 --> 33:38.458
You want a second opinion
from a doctor about that?

33:38.541 --> 33:41.083
- My man.

33:41.166 --> 33:42.583
Nice playing out there,
young blood.

33:42.666 --> 33:45.375
- Ah, thanks, man.
- Where's your better half?

33:45.458 --> 33:47.125
Oh, yeah. She, uh...

33:47.208 --> 33:49.416
She real sorry
she couldn't make it.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.333
Those shrimp,
they ain't sittin' right.

33:53.625 --> 33:55.250
Excuse me.

33:56.750 --> 33:57.875
Word to the wise.

33:57.958 --> 34:00.375
Next time, just say
it's her time of the month.

34:00.458 --> 34:02.916
Everybody at the party
ate those shrimp.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.958
- Ah shit...
- None of my business.
Just pullin' a brother's coat.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.166
Appreciate that.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.541
You're in a moment,
little brother.

34:11.625 --> 34:13.833
Worst thing in the world
is losing a good woman.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.708
Maybe a little late
with this one though.

34:20.791 --> 34:23.375
She break shit?
Get the cops called?

34:23.458 --> 34:25.625
Nah. Nah, nah.
That ain't Cookie.

34:25.708 --> 34:28.333
It'll be alright.
Takes two to tango.

34:28.416 --> 34:30.208
We choose them,
but they choose us, too.

34:30.291 --> 34:33.625
You think she'd be
wantin' your ass so bad
if nobody was chasin' it?

34:36.833 --> 34:38.625
You right.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.750
- You ain't no doctor.

34:40.833 --> 34:42.875
- You a mind reader, man.
- No, no, no.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.583
I'm just a friend
who's lived it, alright?

34:55.625 --> 34:57.833
<i>That's the sick joke.</i>

34:58.916 --> 35:01.291
Finally found
my fuckin' thing,

35:01.375 --> 35:04.166
- and now, it's gone.
- Don't be so dramatic.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.291
- You're still there.
- As what?

35:06.375 --> 35:09.083
Ball boy? Cheerleader?

35:11.375 --> 35:13.541
That's if McKinney
doesn't fire me.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.625
And we're not exactly
seeing eye-to-eye.

35:15.708 --> 35:17.083
You do with Paul.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.291
I did.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.333
He's loyal to Jack.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.083
The guy is his family.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.208
Family can be a burden.

35:30.833 --> 35:32.166
What does that mean?

35:32.250 --> 35:34.416
That means
bonds like that,

35:34.500 --> 35:37.333
sometimes, they can start
to feel like shackles.

35:38.625 --> 35:41.375
And maybe Paul wants this
as bad as you do.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.958
Maybe he needs you
to help him with the key.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.958
- Ah!
- You okay, Jack?

36:08.041 --> 36:10.500
Yeah, the...
flash just got me good.

36:10.583 --> 36:12.375
How's about
a little note, huh?

36:12.458 --> 36:14.041
Little something
for the wall?

36:14.125 --> 36:15.916
Oh, right.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.208
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:27.583 --> 36:28.541
Hm...

36:33.041 --> 36:35.208
Hey now.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.583
- This one's going
right next to Rocky.
- There you go.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.625
Thanks for the memory.

36:42.708 --> 36:44.666
You remember Nick,
though, right?

36:44.750 --> 36:48.208
Oh, no, of course.
I just-- It ...

36:48.291 --> 36:49.875
It takes me a minute to, uh,

36:49.958 --> 36:52.625
- connect the dots these days.
- Uh-huh.

36:55.916 --> 36:57.166
Which is why

36:57.250 --> 36:59.375
I'm really gonna need your help
when we're back out there.

36:59.458 --> 37:00.958
I'm really gonna
be leaning on you.

37:01.041 --> 37:03.458
Oh, yeah, of course.
Of course.

37:05.875 --> 37:09.125
Pat could be very helpful
with that, too. He is...

37:09.208 --> 37:12.125
- He's a hell of a resource.
- No Pat.

37:12.208 --> 37:14.625
I need people I can trust, Paul.

37:14.708 --> 37:17.250
It's as simple as that.

37:17.333 --> 37:20.250
- You understand?
- You know I do-- Sorry.

37:20.333 --> 37:23.125
- I just, uh--
- Then have the conversation
with him!

37:23.791 --> 37:25.541
Or I will!

37:29.500 --> 37:31.250
I have to use the john.

37:32.666 --> 37:35.333
- I'm gonna have a BLT.
- Okay.

37:35.416 --> 37:37.541
- Do you want coffee?
- No, Jack!

37:42.291 --> 37:45.208
<i>...interim assistant coach</i>
<i>Pat Riley</i>

37:45.291 --> 37:47.791
<i>is confident that</i>
<i>Paul Westhead,</i>
<i>interim head coach,</i>

37:47.875 --> 37:49.583
<i>is up to snuff.</i>

37:49.666 --> 37:52.000
<i>- Welcome to Philadelphia.</i>
- <i> Hey, thanks very much.</i>

37:55.041 --> 37:56.166
Hey, uh...

37:56.250 --> 37:58.666
Uh, pal, can, can you turn
this up a minute?

37:58.750 --> 38:02.416
<i>They're playing well.</i>
<i>We're, uh...</i>

38:02.500 --> 38:04.875
<i>Good to get eyes on 'em now.</i>
<i>Might see 'em later on</i>
<i>in the season.</i>

38:04.958 --> 38:06.541
<i>You've been holding it</i>
<i>together for a while now,</i>

38:06.625 --> 38:07.625
<i>but it must be nice to have</i>

38:07.708 --> 38:09.416
<i>McKinney travel</i>
<i>with the team again.</i>

38:13.750 --> 38:17.208
<i>Yeah, well, Jack's</i>
<i>still got a road ahead.</i>

38:17.291 --> 38:19.500
<i>You don't expect him</i>
<i>back for playoffs?</i>

38:23.208 --> 38:25.708
You shanty Irish
New York cocksucker.

38:25.791 --> 38:26.875
Fuck you.

38:26.958 --> 38:29.708
<i>You first.</i>

38:29.791 --> 38:33.375
<i>I don't, uh, I don't speak</i>
<i>for Jack or anybody else,</i>

38:33.458 --> 38:35.708
<i>but, uh...</i>

38:35.791 --> 38:38.791
<i>the way the team's</i>
<i>playing under Paul,</i>
<i>we got a good thing.</i>

38:38.875 --> 38:41.833
<i>Everybody's happy.</i>

38:41.916 --> 38:44.250
<i>Changing horses midstream,</i>
<i>that's, uh...</i>

38:46.791 --> 38:49.166
<i>Well, that's just a big risk.</i>

38:51.291 --> 38:52.500
<i>Thank you. Thanks, guys.</i>

38:52.583 --> 38:54.250
<i>- Thanks, Coach.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

38:57.625 --> 38:59.250
I will talk to him.

39:00.541 --> 39:02.333
- I'm asking you a question!
- It's the truth!

39:02.416 --> 39:03.875
Why did you air
our dirty laundry

39:03.958 --> 39:06.208
- on fucking television?!

39:06.291 --> 39:10.083
- What the hell
were you thinking?!
- About you! About us!

39:12.041 --> 39:14.083
About the fact that we're
fuckin' great at this, man.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.166
We're fucking great at it,

39:15.250 --> 39:17.125
and we've got a shot
here to win it all.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.958
You know how rare that is?
Do you?

39:21.291 --> 39:22.916
Most guys go their
whole fucking lives,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
they never get
a chance at this once.

39:25.083 --> 39:27.000
We have it, if we want it.
We have it.

39:27.083 --> 39:29.041
I am not about to
stab Jack in the back.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.041
Good. Then go talk to him,
for Christ's sake.

39:31.125 --> 39:33.041
Go speak to him, man-to-man.

39:33.125 --> 39:36.125
Make him understand that
we should be the ones

39:36.208 --> 39:37.791
to finish out the year.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.333
He can come back next year
when he's healthy,

39:40.416 --> 39:43.000
and we'll move on
someplace else.

39:43.083 --> 39:44.625
- I got to piss.
- No.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.958
Look at me! You tell me
this team is better off

39:47.041 --> 39:48.958
with Jack McKinney as its coach.
Huh?

39:49.041 --> 39:51.541
Not Jack before the accident.
Jack now.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.916
- Tell me that.

39:56.875 --> 39:58.583
We had our shot.

39:58.666 --> 39:59.875
- Oh, bullshit.
- It was-- It was great.

39:59.958 --> 40:01.750
I fucking loved it.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.750
- I'm not about to steal his.
- Oh, don't be a pussy.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.416
You didn't put him
on that fucking bike!

40:05.500 --> 40:07.791
- Just let me fucking
pee in peace!
- No!

40:07.875 --> 40:10.041
- Not until I hear you say it!
- Jesus, for Christ's sakes.

40:10.125 --> 40:12.333
Not until you say
the fucking truth!

40:12.416 --> 40:14.208
That you want this thing!

40:14.291 --> 40:16.208
You want this thing
as much as I do!

40:16.291 --> 40:18.833
- It's not about that.
- Yes, it is.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.125
He's like a brother to me.

40:22.291 --> 40:24.000
Well then,
he'll understand.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.333
Jesus fuck!
Is that fucking blood?

40:30.416 --> 40:31.625
Fuck!

40:31.708 --> 40:33.833
- Hey, we need help!
- Pat?

40:33.916 --> 40:35.500
- We need help in here! Paul?

40:37.083 --> 40:38.500
Paul? Paul!

40:38.583 --> 40:40.875
- Something wrong?
- Go get the fucking trainer!

40:59.291 --> 41:01.000
Good morning.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.583
Good morning.

41:04.791 --> 41:07.500
- Hospital administration, huh?

41:08.208 --> 41:10.000
One day.

41:10.083 --> 41:12.416
Regular hours,
steady pay.

41:15.958 --> 41:17.541
Mm.

41:25.041 --> 41:26.291
You know,

41:26.375 --> 41:28.875
my mom put herself
through night school, too.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.208
Where is she, anyway?
She's still sleeping it off?

41:32.291 --> 41:35.625
- Yeah. Your daughter, too.
- Well,

41:35.708 --> 41:38.458
guess we're not
the Partridge Family.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.625
I've seen worse.

41:40.708 --> 41:43.750
Anyway, thanks
for sticking around.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.416
Hope your husband
isn't too upset

41:47.500 --> 41:50.333
that I wasn't able
to drive you home.

41:50.416 --> 41:53.375
I hope wherever he is,
he's miserable.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.333
<i>Vaya con díos,</i> huh?

41:58.458 --> 42:00.458
<i>Vaya con</i> somebody.

42:00.541 --> 42:03.125
Just not me. Not his son.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.625
Me and my mom
were on our own, too.

42:11.750 --> 42:13.208
For a while.

42:14.250 --> 42:16.750
Those were the salad days.

42:18.375 --> 42:20.166
You love her very much.

42:21.375 --> 42:24.125
I respect her even more.

42:24.208 --> 42:27.916
What she did with what she had,
what she put up with?

42:29.208 --> 42:32.625
Raising me when
she's still a kid herself.

42:32.708 --> 42:34.958
No help from any man
to call himself a husband,

42:35.041 --> 42:37.083
that's for damn sure.

42:37.166 --> 42:39.916
I don't know how
you ladies do it.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.583
But I'd do anything
to pay it back.

42:43.666 --> 42:46.875
- You're a good son.
- Your boy will see
it that way, too.

42:46.958 --> 42:48.666
Do you wanna see
a picture of him?

42:48.750 --> 42:50.083
Yeah!

42:55.791 --> 42:58.375
- What's his name?
- Mario.

43:00.291 --> 43:02.458
- I'll tell you what.

43:02.541 --> 43:04.875
You keep doing the right
thing by my mom,

43:04.958 --> 43:08.250
once she's back up
on her feet, and you're done...

43:10.333 --> 43:11.833
I'll pick up the tab.

43:11.916 --> 43:15.041
Your school, your tuition,
you know, whatever it takes.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.333
On one condition.

43:17.416 --> 43:20.333
That you let me sit with him
at your graduation,

43:20.416 --> 43:22.458
so I can see his face.

43:31.166 --> 43:33.125
That's...

43:33.208 --> 43:35.375
That's very generous of you.

43:39.125 --> 43:41.250
I have my moments.

43:43.666 --> 43:45.291
What's wrong with you?

43:46.208 --> 43:47.583
Jeanie-bean.

43:48.875 --> 43:50.666
She's here for Grandma.

43:51.791 --> 43:52.875
Yeah, of course, she is.

43:52.958 --> 43:55.083
You're not
the fucking patient!

43:55.166 --> 43:57.500
Jeanie, you don't know
what you're talking about.

43:57.583 --> 43:59.666
I know she's dying.

43:59.750 --> 44:01.875
Did you know that?

44:01.958 --> 44:02.916
The treatment

44:03.000 --> 44:05.666
didn't work,
and her cancer is back.

44:05.750 --> 44:08.416
And she made all the doctors
promise not to tell you

44:08.500 --> 44:10.750
because, God forbid,

44:10.833 --> 44:13.500
we put a damper
on your good time

44:13.583 --> 44:15.583
and make you feel bad
for sleeping till noon

44:15.666 --> 44:17.750
- and fucking the nurse!
- That's enough!

44:22.541 --> 44:24.583
It's fine. I'm finished.

44:38.250 --> 44:40.750
- Is that what you heard?

44:43.416 --> 44:44.958
I'm sorry.

44:50.791 --> 44:52.541
Well, shit.

44:59.541 --> 45:01.833
<i>This is Chick Hearn</i>
<i>alongside Keith Erickson.</i>

45:01.916 --> 45:03.708
Welcome to the City
of Brotherly Love, folks,

45:03.791 --> 45:05.708
where a capacity crowd
is here to see

45:05.791 --> 45:07.666
the dazzling Dr. Julius Erving

45:07.750 --> 45:09.833
face off with fellow
All-Star Magic Johnson.

45:09.916 --> 45:11.875
But the drama for
the Lakers, once again,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
is on the sidelines, Keith,

45:14.083 --> 45:15.958
with interim Head Coach
Paul Westhead

45:16.041 --> 45:17.583
rushed minutes ago
to Temple Hospital

45:17.666 --> 45:19.458
<i>to have a kidney stone</i>
<i>removed.</i>

45:19.541 --> 45:21.541
<i>Not making this up,</i>
<i>leaving his assistant,</i>

45:21.625 --> 45:24.958
<i>our own Pat Riley, as</i>
<i>interim interim Head Coach.</i>

45:25.041 --> 45:26.666
<i>This is becoming</i>
<i>quite a tongue twister.</i>

45:26.750 --> 45:29.708
<i>And of course, we wish Paul</i>
<i>all the best and a speedy--</i>

45:29.791 --> 45:30.958
<i>Folks, we've said it before,</i>

45:31.041 --> 45:32.833
<i>but if you want a car</i>
<i>or truck, go see Cal.</i>

45:32.916 --> 45:34.916
<i>Cal Worthington</i>
<i>and his dog Spud--</i>

45:42.458 --> 45:44.083
Well...

45:44.166 --> 45:47.458
it's nice to be the guy
without the catheter for once.

45:48.833 --> 45:51.625
The job should
come with hazard pay.

45:51.708 --> 45:54.583
Does that cover
daggers in the back?

45:57.666 --> 45:59.125
Jack,

45:59.208 --> 46:01.625
will you let us
finish out the year?

46:07.083 --> 46:09.291
I'm not trying to steal
your team, Jack.

46:09.791 --> 46:11.083
No?

46:11.166 --> 46:12.541
While you recuperate,

46:12.625 --> 46:14.000
while you get ready
for next season.

46:14.083 --> 46:15.333
It's what's best for everyone.

46:15.416 --> 46:18.000
- I understand.
- Especially the guys--

46:18.083 --> 46:19.416
You do?

46:20.458 --> 46:22.041
I understand completely.

46:23.458 --> 46:24.708
Jack...

46:24.791 --> 46:27.416
You have no idea what
a relief that is. I...

46:28.541 --> 46:30.750
I drove myself sick--

46:30.833 --> 46:33.833
Do you know why
I picked you, Paul?

46:33.916 --> 46:37.666
Because I know how hard
that job can be.

46:38.541 --> 46:41.166
How frustrating...

46:41.250 --> 46:43.958
Being stuck as someone's flunky

46:44.041 --> 46:46.000
when you're capable of more.

46:46.083 --> 46:48.791
I didn't want someone
to go through that.

46:49.791 --> 46:52.000
Like I did.

46:52.083 --> 46:54.833
That's why I picked you.

46:54.916 --> 46:57.500
Because you're not
capable of more.

47:00.250 --> 47:03.833
No... Actually, that's not fair.

47:05.583 --> 47:08.333
I thought I saw loyalty.

47:08.416 --> 47:11.208
So, you did surprise me
after all.

47:12.666 --> 47:15.666
This is my life's work

47:15.750 --> 47:18.416
you want to take away from me.

47:19.375 --> 47:22.000
You fucking dilettante.

47:26.583 --> 47:28.208
Alright, Paul's not here,

47:28.291 --> 47:30.333
but we're sticking
with the plan.
Stick with the plan.

47:30.416 --> 47:33.125
Push the ball.
Intensity on defense
and rebound.

47:33.208 --> 47:34.625
Let's go.
Team on three.

47:34.708 --> 47:36.416
- One, two, three, team!
- Team!

47:40.625 --> 47:42.083
Let's go, fellas.

47:44.458 --> 47:46.500
Welcome to
the hot seat, Coach.

47:46.583 --> 47:48.750
Might wanna look into
some life insurance.

47:52.916 --> 47:54.708
Welcome to Philadelphia,
young blood.

47:54.791 --> 47:56.250
- Ready for this?
- You already know it.

47:56.333 --> 47:57.875
What's up? Are you ready?

47:58.000 --> 47:59.375
- I know you're ready.
- Good.

47:59.458 --> 48:01.375
Tonight with the All-Star break
behind them, the Lakers will be

48:01.458 --> 48:03.166
looking to get back
to their winning ways.

48:03.250 --> 48:04.791
<i>Always better when you</i>
<i>can get that first win</i>

48:04.875 --> 48:06.416
<i>- under your belt.</i>
- <i> Absolutely.</i>

48:13.083 --> 48:15.041
Go! Go.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.666
Looks a little
different up close.

48:48.833 --> 48:50.166
<i>My, oh, my, Keith,</i>
<i>I'll tell you,</i>

48:50.250 --> 48:51.958
<i>a blistering loss</i>
<i>for these Lakers.</i>

48:52.041 --> 48:53.291
<i>And easily,</i>
<i>I got to tell you,</i>

48:53.375 --> 48:55.458
the worst game of the season
for young Magic Johnson,

48:55.541 --> 48:57.333
<i>who looked</i>
<i>every bit the rookie</i>

48:57.416 --> 48:59.375
<i>out there next to Dr. J.</i>

48:59.458 --> 49:02.000
Just a-a very poor performance
by the young kid from Lansing.

49:20.291 --> 49:22.333
We showing you
enough hospitality

49:22.416 --> 49:24.041
in the City of Brotherly Love?

49:24.125 --> 49:25.250
- Come on, man.

49:25.333 --> 49:26.750
You what-- You ain't got
enough on the court?

49:26.833 --> 49:28.375
You gotta dunk on me
in the locker room, too?

49:28.458 --> 49:31.208
Come on. Cap. Good game.
Really good game.

49:31.291 --> 49:33.666
Good to see you, Coop.
Big Spence.

49:33.750 --> 49:36.166
- I got bruises all over
my body 'cause of you.
- Oh yeah?

49:36.250 --> 49:38.208
Yeah, yeah. You take it
easy next time, alright?

49:38.291 --> 49:39.833
You take it easy every time.

49:39.916 --> 49:42.291
Alright, now, Choney.
Good game, young blood.

49:44.750 --> 49:46.166
You, too.

49:46.250 --> 49:48.666
How's your lady
and those shrimp?
You still up to join us

49:48.750 --> 49:50.541
on the town? I did offer.

49:53.416 --> 49:55.000
I'm good.

49:55.083 --> 49:56.416
Thanks, though.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.083
Raincheck.

50:00.083 --> 50:01.750
This just tonight.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.541
You know that, don't you?

50:06.625 --> 50:09.041
They gonna be other nights.

50:09.125 --> 50:10.875
There always are.

50:26.375 --> 50:28.416
That Julius is
a real nice fellow.

50:30.291 --> 50:32.916
Yeah. Cool as all get-out.

50:34.750 --> 50:38.208
Played you like
a fucking fiddle.

50:41.125 --> 50:44.000
Know, Russell used to do
the same thing to Wilt.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.125
Before a game,
he'd take him out to dinner,

50:46.208 --> 50:48.958
make like he was the best
of friends, and then...

50:49.041 --> 50:50.666
slit his throat.

50:52.541 --> 50:55.833
Never understood why Wilt
kept fallin' for it.

50:55.916 --> 50:58.625
I landed on the thought...

50:58.708 --> 51:02.000
that he needed to be liked
more than he had to win.

51:04.166 --> 51:05.500
Anyways...

51:06.291 --> 51:08.000
he got his wish.

51:10.708 --> 51:13.708
That's why you ain't
want to draft me?

51:13.791 --> 51:15.916
Think I needed
to be liked?

51:18.125 --> 51:20.333
I thought you were
a little too happy.

51:21.458 --> 51:23.833
- Well, I'm a happy guy.
- No, you're not.

51:25.666 --> 51:28.791
No, you hide it behind
those set of pearly whites,

51:28.875 --> 51:31.291
so most folks never know.
But, I do.

51:32.583 --> 51:34.291
Because I know that feeling.

51:37.541 --> 51:39.500
If I had any sense,

51:39.583 --> 51:43.666
I'd be sitting on
a fuckin' beach right now...

51:43.750 --> 51:47.125
with my beautiful bride sipping
Mai-Tais and giving her a baby.

51:49.291 --> 51:50.750
But I told her...

51:50.833 --> 51:53.625
Riley needed backup,
so I swung out here
to watch you guys

51:53.708 --> 51:57.000
living a life I bitched about
for 20 fuckin' years.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.208
Go fuckin' figure.

52:03.875 --> 52:06.708
You think we got what
it take to win it all?

52:08.375 --> 52:10.625
Got the talent.
That's a gimme.

52:13.125 --> 52:16.541
But that's only
ever gonna get you
press and pussy though.

52:16.625 --> 52:18.250
A championship...

52:19.833 --> 52:22.041
Well...

52:22.125 --> 52:24.250
that takes a real killer.

52:27.583 --> 52:32.750
I scored 25,192 points
in my career.

52:33.791 --> 52:36.000
You know what keeps me up?

52:36.083 --> 52:38.416
If I'd scored 10 more
in just five games,

52:38.500 --> 52:41.916
I'd have five rings instead
of fuckin' nightmares.

52:43.958 --> 52:45.958
You got that one though.

52:46.041 --> 52:48.208
Yeah.

52:48.291 --> 52:51.875
And I wouldn't give it up
for all the fucking
happy in the world.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.416
You know, we holed up
in a place just like this

53:04.500 --> 53:06.666
when we first got here,
Ma and me.

53:18.583 --> 53:20.708
- I'm sorry.

53:24.500 --> 53:26.625
She's gonna die.

53:46.416 --> 53:48.958
I'm sorry.

54:35.708 --> 54:38.291
Happy's a distraction.

54:38.375 --> 54:39.791
Nobody...

54:39.875 --> 54:42.625
Nobody will ever
understand that.

54:42.708 --> 54:44.875
Not your family.
Not your fucking teammates.

54:44.958 --> 54:46.583
Not your woman. Nobody.

54:49.750 --> 54:51.916
<i>Matter of fact, they might</i>
<i>even hate your fucking guts</i>

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
<i>because of it.</i>

55:01.916 --> 55:03.750
I wanna win.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.541
- I want...
- You what?

55:09.625 --> 55:11.041
I wanna win.

55:15.458 --> 55:17.208
I wanna win.

55:18.333 --> 55:21.333
I fucking want--
I fucking wanna win!

55:21.416 --> 55:23.000
I got to!

55:23.583 --> 55:25.041
I got to.

55:27.875 --> 55:30.083
Well...

55:30.166 --> 55:32.000
we're gonna find out.
