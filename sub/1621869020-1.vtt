14:40.045 --> 14:42.348
His wife and kids right now,
Arya?

14:43.682 --> 14:45.050
Are you listening?

14:45.351 --> 14:47.185
[somber disconcerting music]

14:47.719 --> 14:49.187
[man]
You alright?

14:49.721 --> 14:50.522
[woman]
Babe?

14:50.522 --> 14:51.890
[man]
I know you've been really

14:51.890 --> 14:53.191
in damn lately.

14:54.526 --> 14:56.528
This can't be,
he's literally the

14:56.528 --> 14:58.530
biggest name on my bucket li.

15:01.032 --> 15:03.702
I'm sorry, you said your buct
list?

15:03.702 --> 15:05.737
Yes, a fucking bucket list,
Wolf!

15:06.071 --> 15:09.541
People who are alive and have
dreams tend to have those.

15:10.208 --> 15:13.545
You would know if your whole
life wasn't so damn mediocre.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.046
Arya, what the fuck!

15:15.046 --> 15:15.714
Wow.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.083
Stop calling me, I'm busy
working.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.080
[phone ringing]

[muffled applause and cheeri]

17:29.515 --> 17:31.683
[tense dramatic synthetic music]

17:32.684 --> 17:34.352
What do we do with
our time when time

17:34.352 --> 17:36.021
is non existent,
when Monday feels

17:36.021 --> 17:37.689
like a torpid Sunday
and Friday feels

17:37.689 --> 17:39.057
like the day after
your birthday.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.025
[upbeat music]

17:40.025 --> 17:42.528
No car horns asking
us to move faster,

17:42.528 --> 17:45.030
no emails nagging
us for attention.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.533
What do we fall on then?

17:47.533 --> 17:49.067
Who do we fall on?

17:49.067 --> 17:52.070
Our friends, drugs, drinking?

17:53.739 --> 17:54.740
Our faith?

18:02.147 --> 18:04.249
[sounds of running on treadmill]

18:05.884 --> 18:07.385
[somber slow music]

18:10.556 --> 18:12.558
Rabbi, you need to unmute.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.393
[rabbi]
As people are still

18:15.393 --> 18:16.728
entering our virtual room

18:16.728 --> 18:19.264
it's really
great to see all of you.

18:19.731 --> 18:23.769
Someone actually commented tt
this year we can actually drk

18:23.769 --> 18:27.773
four cups of wine because no
one should be driving anywhe.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.410
We are told in the
past sober sader

18:32.410 --> 18:35.581
to feel as though we were
there...

18:36.247 --> 18:37.616
during the exodus

18:38.584 --> 18:41.920
and in many ways this year it
feels like we are there.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.088
[somber violin music]

18:43.088 --> 18:45.456
We get a sense of what
they felt not know what the

18:45.456 --> 18:48.093
future would bring but
with a deep sense of hope.

18:50.762 --> 18:51.797
[man coughing]

18:58.770 --> 19:00.772
May we think of
some of the individuals

19:00.772 --> 19:03.108
we're usually with at this te

19:03.642 --> 19:06.778
and bring them into
our hearts and maybe

19:06.778 --> 19:10.281
some of the foods
that they normally bring

19:12.150 --> 19:14.285
and acknowledge
that this year is

19:14.285 --> 19:16.287
a little different
than the others.

19:16.955 --> 19:21.993
At the same time we also know
that the Jews escaped slavery.

19:21.993 --> 19:23.128
[man coughing]

19:23.461 --> 19:26.965
They grew from it and emerged
even stronger than before.

19:29.467 --> 19:31.136
[pen clicking on and off]

20:22.688 --> 20:23.689
Shit.

20:27.693 --> 20:28.694
Sorry, bud.

With the death toll ever risg

21:19.410 --> 21:20.278

21:20.278 --> 21:22.413
[newscaster]
from ourselves and

21:22.413 --> 21:24.115
and our loved ones. What happens
next...

21:24.115 --> 21:25.416
[phone buzzing]

21:26.084 --> 21:29.755
The staging during this time has
reached epic proportions.

21:29.755 --> 21:30.756
Hey, sis.

21:30.756 --> 21:31.757
[sis]
Hi!

21:33.424 --> 21:35.093
I'm calling to check in.

21:35.593 --> 21:38.096
Yea, yea, we're doing good. I'm
just doing some spring cleaning.

21:38.764 --> 21:42.100
Getting the house in order since
we can't go anywhere.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.135
How are you? How's Cedar Pri?

21:44.803 --> 21:47.105
[sis]
Fine, yea...

21:48.774 --> 21:50.809
I got everything I needed
online.

21:52.778 --> 21:53.945
How, how's Ari?

21:59.617 --> 22:01.319
You have to talk about it.
- Yea, yea.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.791
He loves you, you, you love him.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.797
Well you know that
you have a place with

22:11.797 --> 22:14.800
me here in Philly
if you ever need it.

22:16.301 --> 22:19.805
It's, it's a short drive I...
I can even

22:19.805 --> 22:20.806
I gotta go.

22:21.339 --> 22:23.141
[newscaster in background]

22:23.474 --> 22:27.145
...should stay home for
at least 14 days to protect

22:27.145 --> 22:30.648
others and help slow
the spread of the disease.

23:26.704 --> 23:28.206
Tell me you're ok.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.911
[rabbi]
Let's continue with the

23:32.911 --> 23:35.546
recitation of the 10
plagues and remove

23:35.546 --> 23:38.216
a drop from our glass
with each plague.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.219
[woman singing in Hebrew]

Ari, where's the inhaler!

Stay with me! Stay with me!

[disconcerting soft tender
music]

28:35.213 --> 28:37.014
[rabbi]
In creating a holiday about e

28:37.014 --> 28:39.684
joy of freedom we
turn the story of our

28:39.684 --> 28:42.187
bitter history into a
sweet celebration.

28:42.520 --> 28:47.358
This year is obviously very
different than all other yea.

28:47.358 --> 28:49.727
Let's make an individual toa,

28:49.727 --> 28:52.197
thinking of someone
we care about.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.400
Thinking of a prayer for that
individual.

28:55.866 --> 28:58.035
Let's just hold it in our
hearts.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.205
Someone you care deeply about

29:00.205 --> 29:02.207
but may not be
around your table.

29:02.707 --> 29:05.210
Think about a prayer, a wish for
them.

29:48.085 --> 29:50.087
[Ada singing in Hebrew]

30:10.608 --> 30:12.277
There she is!

30:12.643 --> 30:14.312
So good to see your face.

30:14.779 --> 30:17.448
Bubbie and Zaidy you look so
good.

30:17.948 --> 30:21.286
You look so good to my darli.

30:21.286 --> 30:23.621
Oh it's so wonderful to see you.

Hey.

Ari.

[Ruth]
Ari, hi, shalom.

30:28.826 --> 30:33.331
We're, we're fine, happy to be
together. How are you?

30:34.465 --> 30:36.501
You don't, you don't look we.

30:37.968 --> 30:41.472
Well, I... I've been pretty sick
this week

30:42.139 --> 30:45.676
but Ada took care of me, I'm
really happy to be here.

30:46.644 --> 30:48.979
What, what do you mean like
sick, you mean like the baby?

30:48.979 --> 30:51.982
No Bubbie... not like Jacob.

30:52.983 --> 30:53.984
Don't worry.

30:55.152 --> 30:56.821
Have you been to see him?

30:57.488 --> 30:59.156
- I've wanted to.
- She tried.

30:59.824 --> 31:00.825
Uh huh.

31:01.992 --> 31:03.828
These times are different.

31:05.996 --> 31:08.999
It's a miracle we can all be
together this way.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.006
Well shall we?

31:18.008 --> 31:22.212
Before we start, Zaidy, your
parents during the Holocaust

31:22.513 --> 31:25.182
they lost everything. How did
they do it?

31:30.855 --> 31:31.856
They had me.

31:33.691 --> 31:36.861
Out of death... came new life.

31:39.029 --> 31:43.368
Oh Leebling... remember who u
are.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.537
Remember who you love.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.208
You are God's child, never
forsaken.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.044
Never forgotten.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.548
You are never alone.

31:57.882 --> 32:00.217
Whoa... never.

32:03.754 --> 32:09.927
And now we do this... in honor
those we love.

32:11.396 --> 32:14.599
We do this in honor of those
we've lost.

32:15.065 --> 32:17.402
[speaking in Hebrew]

32:21.739 --> 32:24.575
You are always with us.

32:28.078 --> 32:30.581
Shall we begin with a song for
Him?

[Ada crying while singing]

33:37.147 --> 33:39.149
[heavy beat hip-hop music]

33:43.654 --> 33:45.990
What happens when the
very structure of the groundn

33:45.990 --> 33:48.325
which we stand cracks when
Uncle Sam takes a tumble?

33:48.526 --> 33:49.660
Who steps up?

33:59.504 --> 34:00.671
[ominous tones]

34:04.674 --> 34:05.843
[wind blowing]

34:19.857 --> 34:22.527
[woman]
I feel the air all around me

34:23.193 --> 34:25.962
but the dust is stopping me from
breathing.

34:26.696 --> 34:31.368
I gasp as I try to fill my lungs
but it's no use.

34:32.202 --> 34:36.240
They tell us that we're free,
that we should be grateful.

34:36.707 --> 34:38.408
[woman gasping, yelling]

34:43.212 --> 34:47.885
But the tears don't stop, the
names, the headlines...

34:48.417 --> 34:49.720
It never stops.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.223
I try to push it down but it all
comes out.

34:53.924 --> 34:57.427
Our black bodies screaming for
some hope to hold onto.

34:57.427 --> 34:58.729
[woman yelling]

35:01.098 --> 35:02.099
[gasping]

35:33.130 --> 35:35.933
[woman on phone]
You're not sleeping well.

35:36.266 --> 35:38.102
You wanna talk about it?

35:38.102 --> 35:41.471
I just feel like I should take a
day off. I won't though.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.942
I was about to say because
you've been working on that

35:44.942 --> 35:47.277
page far too long to just
not know if you've got it.

35:47.477 --> 35:49.647
But I can barely sleep, it's
like...

35:52.282 --> 35:56.120
whether I open or close my es
it's a nightmare either way.

35:56.486 --> 35:58.789
[woman on phone]
Oh honey I'm so sorry

35:58.789 --> 36:00.791
but as sad and true as that is

36:01.291 --> 36:03.828
that's such a beautiful way of
putting.

36:04.461 --> 36:05.963
You're such a poet

36:06.631 --> 36:08.465
but I know things
are hard right now but

36:08.465 --> 36:10.300
you just gotta take
it one day at a time.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.738
Let's talk the baseline I
mean it seems like change is

36:13.738 --> 36:15.005
really happening right now

36:15.005 --> 36:16.674
especially with
all the protests.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.344
Do we always have to die to
get attention, or tear gassed

36:20.344 --> 36:23.981
or tazed or traumatized,
it's just for the headlines?

36:24.649 --> 36:27.985
It is too right, it's terrible
but just promise me one thing.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.989
Please be kind to yourself no
matter what happens.

36:33.023 --> 36:34.024
Thanks mom.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.161
Oh I have to go hop on
this call and go put on my

36:37.161 --> 36:39.830
makeup and everything
but I'll talk to you later.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.832
Well good luck and have a good
day.

Did you see the email?

36:57.014 --> 36:59.549
I mean I wanna believe things
will change around here but...

37:00.184 --> 37:02.687
I don't know it feels like a
long shot.

37:03.353 --> 37:06.356
Well you miss 100% of the shs
you don't take.

37:07.024 --> 37:10.060
Anyway I know this campaign is
gonna be fire.

37:10.527 --> 37:13.030
I just hope you take over the
reigns.

37:13.530 --> 37:14.531
Yea.

37:16.233 --> 37:17.735
Hey guys, good morning.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.369

How's it going?
How's the whole corn

Hey, Abby, how's it going?

37:22.406 --> 37:23.540

37:23.540 --> 37:24.574
So well, Abby.

Alrighty, let's...

37:26.076 --> 37:27.712
I'm excited to get this started.

37:27.712 --> 37:31.548
I deliberated with two create
directors, guys we decided

37:31.548 --> 37:35.219
we are going to go with Abby's
pitch so she'll be taking the

37:35.219 --> 37:38.723
bigger producer role on this.
Farida you are going to do

37:38.723 --> 37:42.727
account management and Samuel
of course on art direction duty.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.895
Any other questions?

37:45.562 --> 37:46.897
I'd be really open to some

37:46.897 --> 37:48.398
feedback.
It just seemed like the

37:48.398 --> 37:50.067
client really
liked the direction

37:50.067 --> 37:51.568
I was thinking of creatively.

37:52.236 --> 37:54.739
[white guy]
Yea and it's, they absolutely

37:54.739 --> 37:56.741
loved it, you know incorporating

37:56.741 --> 37:58.909
local artists,
muralists, especially

37:58.909 --> 38:01.078
diverse communities
was a fantastic

38:01.078 --> 38:03.247
idea but we wanted
to go with someone

38:03.247 --> 38:05.415
with a little more experience.
Abby

38:05.415 --> 38:07.584
did such a great
job on the J-Sports

38:07.584 --> 38:09.586
campaign, we have no doubt tt

38:09.586 --> 38:11.789
this would live
up to it as well.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.623
Oh I'm sorry guys I
have to hop on a call

38:13.623 --> 38:15.459
but I'm gonna let
you guys get started.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.261
Yea, thank you.

38:17.261 --> 38:19.263
Alright you guys, take care,
bye.

38:26.603 --> 38:28.105
[man talking]
We come to the point

38:28.105 --> 38:29.940
where we have to
ask ourselves what are

38:29.940 --> 38:31.641
the next steps as
a black community?

38:32.276 --> 38:35.279
Even though the movement
is gaining speed we're

38:35.279 --> 38:38.115
tired anxious and
exhausted from this fight.

38:38.448 --> 38:40.284
I wanna thank you
two for joining me today

38:40.284 --> 38:42.119
and coming on board
to handle this topic.

38:42.119 --> 38:43.287
[other man]
Happy to be here.

Happy to be here, thank you.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.490
[man]
So Sean, you are one

38:46.490 --> 38:49.459
of the leaders of the autonomous
zone project which has

38:49.459 --> 38:52.462
basically barred the police
from their own precincts.

38:53.297 --> 38:55.800
What was the catalyst for this
action?

38:56.967 --> 38:58.635
Well first of all I wouldn't say

38:58.635 --> 39:00.637
that I'm one of the leaders.
I'm just

39:00.637 --> 39:02.306
one of the many voices that came

39:02.306 --> 39:04.174
together to form a
peaceful community.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.477
As we've all seen over
the past couple of days,

39:07.477 --> 39:10.147
the police force is broken.
It is an entity that is

39:10.147 --> 39:12.850
corrupt, it should be de-funded,
abolished and rebuilt

39:12.850 --> 39:15.485
into something that serves
our entire community.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.655
I think we as a society keep
trying to change a system

39:18.655 --> 39:21.325
that was never intended
to have an equitable end.

39:21.826 --> 39:23.693
Black scholars and
black activists have

39:23.693 --> 39:25.662
been doing work for
years to re-imagine

39:25.662 --> 39:27.197
what our world would look like

39:27.197 --> 39:29.333
without are traditional
use of police.

39:29.333 --> 39:32.837
With all due respect what you're
describing is anarchy.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.505
Our society will
devolve into chaos.

39:35.505 --> 39:37.875
I mean look at,
look at The Raiders.

40:05.735 --> 40:07.371
I'm sorry I just...

40:08.238 --> 40:10.207
I've just been
dealing with a lot at

40:10.207 --> 40:12.209
work and the state
of the world and--

40:12.209 --> 40:15.880
I know the videos are just...
like...

40:16.713 --> 40:19.583
[Farida]
There's just so many and

40:19.917 --> 40:22.052
it just feel so
overwhelming and then

40:22.052 --> 40:24.721
there's also like all
the think pieces and...

40:25.890 --> 40:27.925
all the Twitter
viral videos like

40:27.925 --> 40:30.394
have you seen
this shit it's just...

40:30.760 --> 40:32.429
Your mom even texted me.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.402
I mean are you ok?

40:41.071 --> 40:44.408
Ok... no one especially black
people are ok right now.

40:45.242 --> 40:47.577
I know what you mean I mean
it's just there's

40:48.612 --> 40:51.081
I can't believe all this is
happening.

40:52.416 --> 40:56.253
How can people still be this
hateful... still, I it's--

40:56.586 --> 40:58.755
I mean it makes sense with...

40:58.755 --> 41:02.459
the white supremacists
and racist society we're in.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.595
The pandemic is just making it
more obvious.

41:05.595 --> 41:09.599
Right, I get that I just... m
a bit more optimistic I gues.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.936
I thought we were making
progress.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.603
Don't you see
that by saying that

41:13.603 --> 41:15.272
you're showing your privilege?

41:15.605 --> 41:18.442
Kind of re-centering the story
around yourself.

41:18.775 --> 41:22.279
And your, your perspective on
how things are going down.

41:22.279 --> 41:24.314
Look, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to...

41:25.449 --> 41:28.118
understand but you're not
letting me in.

41:28.118 --> 41:30.320
Yea, it's not about
letting you in, it's

41:30.320 --> 41:32.622
about you doing the work.
I need you to

41:32.622 --> 41:34.959

different night and--

that's, we can watch

41:49.306 --> 41:50.807

had to fight through

43:40.584 --> 43:42.452
much worse.
I can just wear a mask

yourself, ok?

around so many people

make change where we at.

repeatedly just don't. So.

own it cause it's

Then and only then can

1:32:08.822 --> 1:32:10.524

1:43:26.332 --> 1:43:30.336
* Lies an urgent seed

1:43:31.537 --> 1:43:35.842
* Born from the
battle lines drawn *

1:44:14.547 --> 1:44:17.884
* In the after glow

1:44:18.551 --> 1:44:21.554
* We shall taste the fruit

1:44:23.223 --> 1:44:28.729
* Of that which dug deep in s
ground and held to the root*

1:44:30.731 --> 1:44:34.100
* And there will come horses

1:44:35.068 --> 1:44:38.438
* And there will come horses

1:44:39.404 --> 1:44:42.909
* And there will come horses

1:44:43.409 --> 1:44:46.612
* And there will come horses *

1:44:47.580 --> 1:44:51.083
* And there will come horses

1:44:51.752 --> 1:44:55.088
* And there will come horses

1:44:55.788 --> 1:44:59.425
* And there will come horses

1:45:00.092 --> 1:45:03.429
* And there will come horses
