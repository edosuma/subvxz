WEBVTT

00:05.799 --> 00:08.100
I can't helping thinking
I'd be a better fisherman

00:08.102 --> 00:10.302
with a longer, stiffer rod.

00:14.741 --> 00:17.309
Yeah, yeah, I heard it, too.

00:17.311 --> 00:20.479
Well, I, for one, am
a grower, not a shower.

00:25.619 --> 00:26.619
Personally, I'm looking forward

00:26.621 --> 00:27.953
to getting away from my old lady.

00:27.955 --> 00:29.955
Ever since Mother changed
her thyroid medicine,

00:29.957 --> 00:32.424
she's been a real stinker.

00:32.426 --> 00:34.326
Why do we let him come again?

00:34.328 --> 00:36.929
Just because we don't
know why Harry's our friend

00:36.931 --> 00:39.064
doesn't mean he isn't our friend.

00:39.066 --> 00:42.234
It might not be wise to start
analyzing our friendships,

00:42.236 --> 00:44.503
or this whole thing could unravel.

00:45.472 --> 00:47.473
Hello, happy campers.

00:47.475 --> 00:48.507
We almost packed?

00:48.509 --> 00:50.509
Yeah, we got the poles, we got the tent,

00:50.511 --> 00:53.178
got the camping stove, got the BM shovel,

00:53.180 --> 00:55.114
got the shovel to bury the BM shovel...

00:55.116 --> 00:56.615
(laughs) Well, that's good.

00:56.617 --> 00:58.383
I got the lantern, the bug spray,

00:58.385 --> 01:00.486
Victoria's coming, and the coffee pot.

01:02.422 --> 01:04.188
Whoa, I'm... I'm sorry. What?

01:04.191 --> 01:05.757
Yeah, you know, it's one
of those percolating ones

01:05.759 --> 01:07.726
that you could put
right on top of the fire.

01:07.728 --> 01:10.896
Victoria is not coming on this trip.

01:10.898 --> 01:12.264
Hey, no girls allowed.

01:12.266 --> 01:15.067
It's bad enough we invite Harry.

01:15.069 --> 01:16.868
Look, bub, it's my RV we're taking.

01:16.870 --> 01:20.605
And as the mud flaps'll
tell you, "Back off."

01:20.607 --> 01:22.007
It's a guys-only weekend, Carl.

01:22.009 --> 01:23.341
End of story.

01:23.343 --> 01:24.910
I don't think that's your decision to make.

01:24.912 --> 01:26.111
It should be up to the group.

01:26.846 --> 01:28.980
- No. No way.
- Not happening.

01:28.982 --> 01:31.583
Have you all forgotten what
it's like to be in love?

01:31.585 --> 01:33.718
Hmm? To want to spend every moment

01:33.720 --> 01:35.086
with the woman whose smile

01:35.088 --> 01:37.289
is the first thing you
think about when you wake up

01:37.291 --> 01:39.858
and the last thing you thank
God for when you go to bed?

01:40.660 --> 01:42.694
- No. Nah.
- Nuh-uh. Not happening.

01:42.696 --> 01:43.995
You know what?

01:43.997 --> 01:45.096
I don't need your approval.

01:45.098 --> 01:46.965
I'm taking my car, my girlfriend,

01:46.967 --> 01:50.969
and this guys' trip is now
officially a bisexual weekend.

01:52.371 --> 01:55.707
I almost had one of those.

01:55.709 --> 01:57.175
By accident.

01:57.177 --> 01:58.309
It was a dark tent,

01:58.311 --> 02:00.945
I thought I was grabbing a flashlight...

02:00.947 --> 02:03.214
the only thing that lit up was his face.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.586
You're sharing a tent with him.

02:39.676 --> 02:41.677
You gotta sit Victoria down,

02:41.679 --> 02:43.178
tell her she can't come fishing with us.

02:43.180 --> 02:43.840
Victoria's going?

02:43.845 --> 02:45.548
- I thought girls weren't allowed.
- They aren't.

02:45.650 --> 02:47.016
Then why does she get to go?

02:47.018 --> 02:48.450
'Cause Carl invited her.

02:48.452 --> 02:49.618
Well, why didn't you invite me?

02:49.620 --> 02:50.919
'Cause I don't want you to go.

02:53.022 --> 02:54.223
Wow.

02:54.225 --> 02:55.591
No, no, nothing against you.

02:55.593 --> 02:56.625
I don't want her to go, either.

02:56.627 --> 02:57.793
It's gonna ruin the whole weekend.

02:57.795 --> 02:58.894
Well, then, don't go.

02:58.896 --> 03:00.329
It's my trip!

03:00.331 --> 03:03.065
Well, I mean, if it's your trip,

03:03.067 --> 03:05.367
then you can invite

03:05.369 --> 03:07.903
anybody you want to invite.

03:07.905 --> 03:09.571
No, no, no, no.

03:09.573 --> 03:10.772
I'm not playing this game.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.641
There's no game.

03:12.643 --> 03:14.509
I mean, if there was a game,

03:14.511 --> 03:16.411
I guess I'd be losing.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.314
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

03:19.316 --> 03:20.415
Am I ridiculous?

03:20.417 --> 03:22.351
Is that why you don't want to take me?

03:22.353 --> 03:23.518
No. I...

03:23.520 --> 03:24.386
I do. It's just, there's...

03:24.388 --> 03:25.854
Oh, yeah, bup. Don't.

03:25.856 --> 03:27.823
It's okay.

03:27.825 --> 03:28.724
Molly, don't be mad.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.459
I'm not mad.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.694
I'm just a little sad.

03:35.097 --> 03:38.867
Luckily, I've got all
weekend by myself to...

03:38.869 --> 03:40.368
to get over it.

03:45.341 --> 03:47.309
Would you like to go fishing this weekend?

03:47.311 --> 03:49.077
You don't want me to go.

03:49.079 --> 03:51.279
Oh, but I do.

03:52.548 --> 03:55.684
It doesn't feel like you do.

03:57.486 --> 03:58.520
Come on, please?

03:58.522 --> 03:59.487
I... it'll be fun.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.455
Well, now you're begging,

04:00.457 --> 04:02.824
so I feel like I have to say yes.

04:04.093 --> 04:05.226
Thank you.

04:05.228 --> 04:07.195
Hey...

04:07.197 --> 04:09.564
you're welcome.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.270
What the hell just happened to me?

04:23.612 --> 04:26.614
What is that odd smell in your RV?

04:26.616 --> 04:28.583
Is it coming from the
bathroom or the fridge?

04:28.585 --> 04:29.784
Fridge.

04:29.786 --> 04:32.320
Oh, then it's urine.

04:33.555 --> 04:34.522
I said "fridge."

04:34.524 --> 04:36.624
And I said "urine."

04:36.626 --> 04:37.725
It's puma urine.

04:37.727 --> 04:38.993
It's a bear repellent.

04:38.995 --> 04:41.028
Yeah. Works on people, too.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.430
Mark my words,

04:42.432 --> 04:44.832
when you see a mama grizzly
circling the campsite,

04:44.834 --> 04:48.803
you'll be splashing it on
like it's English Leather.

04:48.805 --> 04:50.905
You happy? You got your way.

04:50.907 --> 04:53.441
Now our guys' weekend is
turning into a couples' retreat.

04:53.443 --> 04:55.609
Oh, Molly's coming? That's great.

04:55.611 --> 04:58.145
Evens up the teams for Scattergories.

04:58.147 --> 04:59.814
Sure, bring all the board games.

04:59.816 --> 05:01.849
It's not like we're gonna be
able to do anything fun anyway.

05:01.851 --> 05:03.751
(high-pitched voice): "Cigars
will stink up the tent."

05:03.753 --> 05:05.219
"Slingshots are dangerous."

05:05.221 --> 05:07.488
"Cherry bombs are a
terrible way to catch fish."

05:07.490 --> 05:11.258
Boy, we sure blasted
our limit last year, huh?

05:11.260 --> 05:13.093
Yeah, well, now we're gonna
have to rely on our wits.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.295
Did you hear what I said, Carl?

05:14.297 --> 05:15.563
Our wits.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.132
Where can I put these?

05:18.134 --> 05:20.167
I thought you already packed your stuff.

05:20.169 --> 05:22.002
I got some extra baggage.

05:23.371 --> 05:26.006
I hope you boys are ready to become men.

05:26.008 --> 05:27.641
Mama's bringing moonshine.

05:31.379 --> 05:34.048
I did not start this chain of events.

05:34.050 --> 05:36.150
Nor did I have the balls to stop it.

05:38.753 --> 05:41.121
I have always wanted to go
on one of Mike's guy trips,

05:41.123 --> 05:42.656
if only to observe, you know?

05:42.658 --> 05:44.525
What do they talk about? What do they eat?

05:44.527 --> 05:45.592
Do they sleep alone?

05:45.594 --> 05:47.327
Or all together in a pile, like kittens?

05:47.329 --> 05:48.529
Oh...

05:49.631 --> 05:52.299
I hope that's true.

05:52.301 --> 05:54.902
Well, I'm just happy you
and Mom are coming along.

05:54.904 --> 05:56.470
You know, I've been dreading this weekend.

05:56.472 --> 05:58.138
Why?

05:58.140 --> 05:59.373
I don't know.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.041
Carl and I are kind of at a weird place

06:01.043 --> 06:03.110
- in our relationship right now.
- What do you mean?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.611
Like, "where is this going" weird?

06:04.613 --> 06:06.046
Or "don't tell your sister

06:06.048 --> 06:09.549
because it might haunt her dreams" weird?

06:09.551 --> 06:11.051
The first one.

06:11.053 --> 06:12.652
Okay. Good.

06:12.654 --> 06:15.355
'Cause that image of Carl
in nothing but a Zorro mask

06:15.357 --> 06:17.691
still kind of keeps me up at night.

06:19.427 --> 06:22.429
The thing is, I like Carl.

06:22.431 --> 06:24.397
A lot.

06:24.399 --> 06:26.900
He is so kind and attentive

06:26.902 --> 06:30.103
and just crazy about me.

06:30.105 --> 06:33.006
So, what's... what's the problem?

06:33.008 --> 06:36.242
I kind of had a quickie
with my ex-boyfriend.

06:36.244 --> 06:37.210
What do you mean "kind of"?

06:37.212 --> 06:38.545
Kind of definitely.

06:38.547 --> 06:40.613
Kind of... how could you do that?

06:40.615 --> 06:42.048
I don't know, it just happened.

06:42.050 --> 06:44.517
I got a text saying he found my sunglasses.

06:44.519 --> 06:45.752
But it wasn't so much a text

06:45.754 --> 06:48.454
as a picture of my sunglasses on his penis.

06:50.691 --> 06:54.127
And when I went to go get
them, they were still there.

06:54.129 --> 06:56.529
Okay, you said you weren't
gonna haunt my dreams!

06:56.531 --> 06:57.830
- I'm sorry! I'm so sorry...
- No, you're not!

06:57.832 --> 06:59.299
- I don't think you...
- Hey. - Hey.

06:59.301 --> 07:01.901
Hey...

07:01.903 --> 07:03.436
What's going on?

07:03.438 --> 07:04.771
Nothing.

07:04.773 --> 07:07.006
Why would anything be going on?

07:07.008 --> 07:09.075
Well, because I asked
you to pack the cooler.

07:09.077 --> 07:10.743
Yeah, well, all right, here you go.

07:10.745 --> 07:12.945
Take it away.

07:14.148 --> 07:16.749
I know what's happening here.

07:18.452 --> 07:20.419
I knew it. Healthy snacks.

07:20.421 --> 07:22.355
- Where's my beef jerky?
- Ah...

07:22.357 --> 07:24.490
Oh, you got us!

07:24.492 --> 07:26.559
(Victoria and Molly laugh nervously)

07:26.561 --> 07:28.127
What'd I tell you, Carl?

07:28.129 --> 07:29.328
Turn your back for a second,

07:29.330 --> 07:31.030
they start playing Hide the Jerky on you.

07:31.032 --> 07:32.198
Mm-hmm.

07:34.468 --> 07:35.801
You little devil.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.236
What other mischief you been up to?

07:37.238 --> 07:39.338
- Well, to be honest...
- MOLLY: Hey!

07:39.340 --> 07:40.406
What is it... wh...

07:40.408 --> 07:42.041
what is with the third degree, Carl?

07:42.043 --> 07:45.644
Can't you see she that feels
guilty enough about the jerky?

07:45.646 --> 07:47.113
Can't you see that?

07:48.982 --> 07:51.183
This is why they don't invite girls!

07:53.000 --> 07:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:05.749 --> 08:08.250
An hour and 15 minutes behind schedule.

08:08.252 --> 08:10.319
First time ever.

08:10.321 --> 08:12.721
I wonder what changed.

08:12.723 --> 08:14.290
Uh, he's getting a little cranky.

08:14.292 --> 08:16.025
Is there a juice box for him back there?

08:16.027 --> 08:18.027
He's already had two.

08:18.029 --> 08:20.162
Just gimme.

08:22.098 --> 08:23.532
I mean, what would you have done?

08:23.534 --> 08:25.267
They were very expensive sunglasses.

08:25.269 --> 08:27.803
Ugh. I don't want to see that.

08:27.805 --> 08:29.471
See what?

08:29.473 --> 08:31.306
Nothing. Victoria's just...

08:31.308 --> 08:33.375
having some trouble with her cell phone.

08:33.376 --> 08:34.775
Really? Let me take a look at that.

08:34.778 --> 08:36.511
No, no, no. No. Ten and two.

08:36.514 --> 08:38.080
Hands on the wheel.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.515
Besides, it's not really
her phone, it's her plan.

08:40.518 --> 08:41.884
Oh, yeah? What's the problem?

08:41.885 --> 08:45.087
Her old provider is trying
to get her to switch back.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.321
But she's very happy

08:46.323 --> 08:47.589
with her current service. Right?

08:47.591 --> 08:48.824
I am.

08:48.826 --> 08:50.325
But you know how I have trouble

08:50.327 --> 08:52.794
committing to long-term contracts.

08:52.796 --> 08:54.696
You've been hopping from plan to plan

08:54.698 --> 08:57.199
and that's not working out for you, is it?

08:57.201 --> 08:59.468
That's true.

08:59.470 --> 09:01.536
I mean, look at me. I've
been with the same provider

09:01.538 --> 09:03.805
for three years and I am very happy.

09:03.807 --> 09:05.006
What are you talking about?

09:05.008 --> 09:06.408
You complain about 'em all the time.

09:06.410 --> 09:08.677
Well, I still love him.

09:09.712 --> 09:11.646
I'm with Victoria on this.

09:11.648 --> 09:13.582
It's hard to stay loyal
with the other companies

09:13.584 --> 09:15.750
dangling special offers in your face.

09:15.752 --> 09:17.752
I say just pick one.

09:17.754 --> 09:20.722
They're all gonna screw you in the end.

09:20.724 --> 09:22.490
You ever thought about a group plan?

09:22.492 --> 09:24.059
She does not need a group plan.

09:24.061 --> 09:26.261
Just drink your juice.

09:29.732 --> 09:31.032
(Carl scoffs)

09:31.034 --> 09:33.101
I... I can't believe we
pass this place every year

09:33.103 --> 09:34.302
and have never stopped.

09:34.304 --> 09:36.271
You know, what might have kept us away is

09:36.273 --> 09:40.275
that big sign out front
that says "Antiques."

09:40.277 --> 09:42.310
I... I thought it'd be a
little treat for the ladies.

09:42.312 --> 09:43.845
It is.

09:43.847 --> 09:46.481
And thank you very much.

09:46.483 --> 09:47.682
(chuckles)

09:47.684 --> 09:50.919
(whispering): Come here,
come here, come here.

09:52.655 --> 09:54.856
I... I miss you already!

10:00.629 --> 10:02.730
Hey, let me ask you something.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.932
Y... you think Victoria's
been acting differently?

10:04.934 --> 10:06.400
We're all acting differently.

10:06.402 --> 10:09.604
Look where we are, it's not natural.

10:09.606 --> 10:11.873
No, I'm telling you, for,
like, the last week or so,

10:11.875 --> 10:13.374
she's been a little distant, you know?

10:13.376 --> 10:14.709
And it's little things.

10:14.711 --> 10:17.111
Like, the other night, we went
out to eat at a restaurant,

10:17.113 --> 10:18.579
I was wearing my "I'm hers" T-shirt,

10:18.581 --> 10:21.015
she wasn't wearing her "I'm his."

10:21.017 --> 10:24.085
I looked like an idiot.

10:26.955 --> 10:29.690
You are an idiot.

10:31.993 --> 10:34.695
No, man, I... I got to
step my game up, you know?

10:34.697 --> 10:36.297
Be more attentive to her needs, you know?

10:36.299 --> 10:38.399
Truly start listening to her.

10:38.401 --> 10:39.734
Or maybe skip all that work

10:39.736 --> 10:41.936
and just buy her something very expensive.

10:41.938 --> 10:43.637
No, no, no, look, look,
don't get desperate.

10:43.639 --> 10:46.106
Now, you got a good thing going
with Victoria... don't ruin it.

10:46.108 --> 10:47.842
Yeah, but I don't want to lose her, Mike.

10:47.844 --> 10:48.976
You're not gonna lose her.

10:48.978 --> 10:50.811
Look, relationships,
they got ebbs and flows.

10:50.813 --> 10:52.179
Like me and Molly, okay?

10:52.181 --> 10:54.515
Whenever I feel like maybe
she's a little bit sick of me,

10:54.517 --> 10:56.150
I make an effort.

10:56.152 --> 10:58.218
I unload the dishwasher a couple times,

10:58.220 --> 11:00.187
we're right back on track.

11:00.189 --> 11:01.588
All right, I hope you're right.

11:01.590 --> 11:02.556
No, I am right.

11:02.558 --> 11:04.091
And if you do do the dishwasher thing,

11:04.093 --> 11:06.059
make sure they're clean
before you unload it.

11:06.061 --> 11:08.262
It really pisses them off.

11:09.164 --> 11:11.732
My stomach is queasy, I'm hot.

11:11.734 --> 11:14.401
Every time I look at Carl, I feel terrible.

11:14.403 --> 11:15.936
Good, you should, it's called guilt.

11:15.938 --> 11:18.472
Darn it, I thought it
was just food poisoning.

11:18.474 --> 11:20.641
How could you do this to such a great guy?

11:20.643 --> 11:22.576
Carl doesn't deserve this,
he deserves your loyalty

11:22.578 --> 11:24.144
and your love and your honesty.

11:24.146 --> 11:25.646
So you think I should tell him what I did?

11:25.648 --> 11:28.048
No, absolutely not.

11:28.050 --> 11:29.483
But you just said, "Be honest."

11:29.485 --> 11:30.784
Not about this.

11:30.786 --> 11:32.819
That's just gonna make
you feel better, not him.

11:33.821 --> 11:35.422
What, do you want to
break this guy's heart?

11:35.424 --> 11:37.991
Oh, my... of course not.

11:37.993 --> 11:40.193
Are you gonna cheat on him again?

11:40.195 --> 11:43.096
- I hope not.
- Victoria!

11:43.098 --> 11:44.264
I won't.

11:44.266 --> 11:45.765
Okay, then, you take it to the grave.

11:45.767 --> 11:47.267
You bury it, you cover it with lime,

11:47.269 --> 11:48.602
you burn the clothes that you wore,

11:48.604 --> 11:50.203
and you never speak of this again.

11:51.639 --> 11:53.273
What about the sunglasses?

11:53.275 --> 11:56.843
Oh, God, tell me those are not the ones.

11:59.313 --> 12:01.815
I kind of went through
a lot to get them back.

12:10.157 --> 12:14.661
Hey, look, the last guy who
got dragged in here by his wife.

12:14.663 --> 12:16.663
Very funny.

12:16.665 --> 12:20.266
So you gonna tell me
what the hell's going on?

12:20.268 --> 12:21.668
What are you talking about?

12:21.670 --> 12:23.703
You and Victoria... something's fishy.

12:23.705 --> 12:26.005
Well, we are on a fishing trip.

12:26.007 --> 12:27.207
Ha...

12:29.109 --> 12:31.244
You're not fooling anybody.

12:31.246 --> 12:32.378
Even Carl?

12:32.380 --> 12:33.546
So there is something.

12:33.548 --> 12:35.081
I didn't say that, I...

12:35.083 --> 12:37.050
Look, Carl's spinning out enough as it is.

12:37.052 --> 12:38.318
Is there something I need to know?

12:38.320 --> 12:41.687
Mike, some things a...
are better left unsaid.

12:41.689 --> 12:43.856
Okay, well, say it to me, and I'll decide.

12:43.858 --> 12:46.192
Ooh...

12:48.028 --> 12:49.729
Hey! No, hey.

12:51.098 --> 12:52.431
Now, look, I'm your husband.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.300
You can't lie to me.

12:54.302 --> 12:55.901
Well, she's my sister; yes, I can.

12:55.903 --> 12:57.169
Besides, I'm not lying to you,

12:57.171 --> 13:00.172
I'm just not, you know,
telling you the truth.

13:01.475 --> 13:03.509
Did she mess around on him?

13:03.511 --> 13:05.077
Okay, look.

13:05.079 --> 13:07.113
I know you don't want to rat out Victoria.

13:07.115 --> 13:08.681
So you don't have to say anything, okay?

13:08.683 --> 13:11.083
Just blink once for yes,

13:11.085 --> 13:12.618
and twice for no.

13:19.626 --> 13:21.160
You have to blink sometime.

13:21.162 --> 13:23.295
No, I don't.

13:24.297 --> 13:26.198
Did you blink when I blinked?

13:26.200 --> 13:28.133
- I don't know, did I?
- Aah!

13:29.536 --> 13:31.370
Okay. All right, fine.

13:31.372 --> 13:33.973
But we've got all weekend
for those peepers of yours

13:33.975 --> 13:35.374
to tell me what's what.

13:38.612 --> 13:40.779
Oh, yeah.

13:49.122 --> 13:51.323
Oh, God, that feels good.

13:54.394 --> 13:56.094
(clears throat) Hey, uh, Victoria,

13:56.096 --> 13:57.596
while we're waiting for those two,

13:57.598 --> 13:59.531
could you, uh, put that visor down?

13:59.533 --> 14:01.533
I'm getting a glare.

14:01.535 --> 14:03.368
We're parked in the shade.

14:03.370 --> 14:06.071
Catching a little something
off the side mirror.

14:06.073 --> 14:06.972
Well, how's the visor...

14:06.974 --> 14:10.008
Just please put the damn thing down.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.276
(gasps)

14:11.278 --> 14:12.911
Would you look at that?

14:12.913 --> 14:17.315
How did an exquisite $218
turquoise necklace get up there?

14:20.486 --> 14:21.920
Carl, why'd you do this?

14:21.922 --> 14:23.922
I'm just stepping up my game.

14:23.924 --> 14:25.690
You know, perfect jewels
for my perfect jewel.

14:25.692 --> 14:27.025
No, I'm not perfect.

14:27.027 --> 14:28.360
Well, you are to me.

14:28.362 --> 14:31.363
MIKE: All right, let's go.

14:31.365 --> 14:33.865
Carl, you don't know me as
well as you think you do.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.434
Sometimes, I make mistakes, okay?

14:36.436 --> 14:37.669
I'm human.

14:37.671 --> 14:39.371
The most perfect one ever created.

14:39.373 --> 14:41.706
Oh, my God, why are
you being so damn nice?!

14:41.708 --> 14:43.908
Baby, wait!

14:46.145 --> 14:47.879
Don't tell him, please don't tell him.

14:47.881 --> 14:49.013
Don't tell him what?

14:52.685 --> 14:55.220
Damn your crazy eyes.

15:02.128 --> 15:03.294
Hey.

15:03.296 --> 15:04.829
Hey.

15:09.335 --> 15:11.002
I need to apologize.

15:11.004 --> 15:12.637
For what?

15:12.639 --> 15:14.405
You have done nothing wrong.

15:14.407 --> 15:15.907
That's not true.

15:15.909 --> 15:18.743
When it comes to women,
I do everything wrong.

15:18.745 --> 15:21.079
I fall too far, too fast.

15:21.081 --> 15:24.315
I say too much, I spend too much.

15:24.317 --> 15:25.850
I am too much.

15:25.852 --> 15:29.587
Oh, baby, you got nothing on me.

15:29.589 --> 15:32.056
I'm all messed up.

15:32.058 --> 15:35.092
When I find a good guy, I'm bad.

15:35.094 --> 15:38.362
And when I find a bad guy, I'm good.

15:38.364 --> 15:40.765
Yeah, which guy am I?

15:40.767 --> 15:41.699
You're a good one.

15:41.701 --> 15:43.901
Uh-oh.

15:45.037 --> 15:48.039
This is really hard for me to say.

15:48.041 --> 15:49.040
Just say it.

15:49.042 --> 15:51.075
Okay. (Clears throat)

15:51.077 --> 15:52.276
Here it goes.

15:54.212 --> 15:57.381
I don't think we should
sleep with other people.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.885
Y... you mean, be exclusive?

16:00.887 --> 16:02.453
Yes.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.556
Yeah, I thought we were.

16:06.958 --> 16:09.293
Oh, good, now it's official.

16:10.295 --> 16:11.428
Wait.

16:11.430 --> 16:12.563
Why?

16:12.565 --> 16:14.865
Did you... ?

16:14.867 --> 16:17.234
You know what?

16:17.236 --> 16:19.236
Never mind.

16:19.238 --> 16:20.571
I don't want to know.

16:20.573 --> 16:22.072
I don't need to know.

16:27.345 --> 16:29.446
That's why I love you.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.648
You do?

16:33.184 --> 16:35.419
I do.

16:49.841 --> 16:52.076
Boy, so much drama.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.678
Is it always like this
on your fishing trips?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.248
Well, usually it's Harry and Samuel

16:57.250 --> 16:59.316
who end up snuggling in the back seat.

16:59.318 --> 17:02.186
Oh, you really do sleep like kittens.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.387
What?

17:03.389 --> 17:04.387
Never mind.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.689
Just step on it.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.358
The others are probably full
of fish and moonshine by now.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.295
Lucky bastards.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.297
Try it now.

17:13.299 --> 17:16.133
(engine turns, doesn't start)

17:16.135 --> 17:18.135
Poor thing, it sounds like Mother

17:18.137 --> 17:21.204
after her first cigar in the morning.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.141
Hey, chubs, not only is
your RV a piece of crap,

17:24.143 --> 17:28.712
but the apple juice in
your fridge tastes like ass.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.881
Well, you're close.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.384
Bad news... this engine's shot.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.719
Looks like we're not going anywhere.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.554
In the driveway or in the woods...

17:37.556 --> 17:39.890
moonshine tastes the same to me.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.558
You know what?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.628
Maybe we should just take
this party to the backyard.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.697
I'll fill up the kiddie
pool, we'll stick our feet in.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.632
It'll be just like the lake.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.133
Actually, a weekend without Mike and Carl

17:50.135 --> 17:51.768
sounds pretty good to me.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.303
Yeah, let's do this!

17:53.305 --> 17:55.572
Uh, does this mean I have to go home?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.007
Oh, honey.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.276
No, course not.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.178
You can go to a movie or something.
