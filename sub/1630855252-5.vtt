00:07.750 --> 00:10.820
- [device vibrating]
- [Lily] Oh, my God,
that feels so good.

00:11.020 --> 00:13.200
Oh, that's so good.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.200
Deeper, baby. Go deeper.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.040
[Nick] I don't want to hurt you.
I don't think you can handle it.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.960
[Lily] Oh, I can handle it.
Oh, I need it now.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.800
Oh, yeah. Oh! Yeah, that's
the spot, that's the spot.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.380
That's the spot right there,
right there, right there.

00:26.580 --> 00:28.680
Oh, yes, yes.

00:28.870 --> 00:30.340
Every Thanksgiving,
without fail,

00:30.540 --> 00:32.430
I hurt my back volunteering.

00:32.630 --> 00:35.970
This time, it was a box
of canned yams that got me.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.600
I told you,
the correct way to lift a box

00:38.800 --> 00:41.100
is with your legs, Diaz,
not your back.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.360
Thankfully,
this year wasn't so bad

00:43.560 --> 00:46.360
because my sweet boyfriend did
most of the heavy lifting.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.280
- [vibrating stops]
- Whoa.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.760
Call me boyfriend again.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.090
- Okay, boyfriend.
- [chuckles]

00:58.510 --> 01:01.290
- [phone chimes]
- [Nick groans]
- Aw, really?

01:01.490 --> 01:02.960
Hey, if that's Jorge,

01:03.160 --> 01:04.880
you tell him for the final time
I'm not donating my Tevas.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.420
They're coming back
into fashion,

01:06.620 --> 01:08.610
- and I'm gonna be
ahead of the trend.
- [laughs]

01:10.270 --> 01:13.090
Oh, it's-it's Santiago
texting me Happy Thanksgiving.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.320
Oh, that's nice.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.810
Are you sure you're okay?

01:17.010 --> 01:20.440
With Santi and I being friends?

01:20.630 --> 01:23.310
- Well, I trust my girlfriend.
- Yeah.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.110
- Call me girlfriend again.
- Okay, girlfriend.

01:26.310 --> 01:28.230
And the fact that
you tell me about it every time

01:28.430 --> 01:29.900
makes me trust you even more.

01:30.100 --> 01:33.990
- You do tell me
every time, though, right?
- Of course.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.450
He left me one voice mail,
and we text every now and then.

01:36.650 --> 01:39.120
Okay, then I'm only
three percent bothered by it.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.120
Oh, wow,
that's 97% cool of you.

01:42.320 --> 01:45.640
- Mm, math. Sexy.
- Mm.

01:46.850 --> 01:48.600
23 x 3.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.320

01:57.860 --> 02:01.390
[Henry] And Happy Thanksgiving
to you, too.

02:01.590 --> 02:03.810
- Oh!
- [gasps] Wow.

02:04.010 --> 02:05.400
Hey, Beatriz, Jorge!

02:05.600 --> 02:07.690
- Hey!
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Happy Thanksgiving.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.230
- You're right on time.
- Well, put us to work, <i>jefe.</i>

02:10.430 --> 02:13.030
Oh, and don't hold back, because
I need to regain my muscle mass

02:13.230 --> 02:15.280
from all the months
of lounging on the beach.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.780
- Oh.
- Right, rub it in, okay.

02:17.980 --> 02:20.410
[laughs] It's actually
my handsome vice <i>jefe</i>

02:20.610 --> 02:21.950
that is in charge of
handing out the jobs today,

02:22.150 --> 02:23.620
and I trust him completely

02:23.820 --> 02:26.880
to assign your skills
where they are best suited.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.500
[whispers] You'll be
in the kitchen.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.050
I was gonna say kitchen.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.760
Let me do my job.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.340
Vice <i>jefe</i> isn't just
a ceremonial title, Jorge.

02:35.540 --> 02:38.760
- Okay. This way. Come on.
- Okay.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.610
[Henry] I love you.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.730
Hola, beautiful.

02:48.930 --> 02:51.230
- Laz! Hey, stud.
- [laughs]

02:51.430 --> 02:53.240
So are those gently used clothes
in your bag,

02:53.440 --> 02:54.490
or are you just happy to see me?

02:54.690 --> 02:56.280
- Both. [laughs]
- Okay.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.200
What are you and Santiago up to
for the holiday?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.540
Oh, we're ordering
some pizza from Burnside.

03:00.730 --> 03:02.950
Bur... That's not even
a good pizza place.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.830
Ah, a little pineapple
and pepperoni, it's okay.

03:07.030 --> 03:08.290
Wait, really?

03:08.490 --> 03:11.250
Thanksgiving's been, uh,
sort of cancelled

03:11.450 --> 03:12.760
ever since my wife passed.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.340
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

03:14.540 --> 03:15.970
Two beautiful men,
sad and alone

03:16.170 --> 03:18.180
on Thanksgiving,
eating shitty pizza...

03:18.380 --> 03:19.350
Not on my watch.

03:19.540 --> 03:20.930
I think I'm gonna have to insist
that you come

03:21.130 --> 03:23.310
to the Diaz house for
a proper Thanksgiving dinner.

03:23.510 --> 03:25.770
- Look, that's very generous...
- No, it's not generous.

03:25.970 --> 03:28.940
It is selfish.
I need some eye candy. Help me.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.610
Yeah. Exactly.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.820
- [laughs]
- Come on.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.400
Santi and Lily are friends now,
right?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.530
- It's all good.
- I'll tell you what,

03:37.730 --> 03:39.200
we'll think about it.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.320
Fair enough?

03:40.520 --> 03:42.490
You, thinking about me?

03:42.690 --> 03:43.840
I don't hate it.

03:54.020 --> 03:55.630
What's this?

03:55.830 --> 03:59.300
Ah, shit, you weren't
supposed to see that.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.760
Is this for me?

04:00.960 --> 04:02.850
Yes, but it's for later.

04:03.050 --> 04:05.850
I'm sorry,
but once you discover a gift,

04:06.050 --> 04:07.530
you got to open it,
them's the rules.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.610
[gasps]

04:11.810 --> 04:14.440
My first official lab coat.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.960
Thank you.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.710
Dr. Sol Perez.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.410
Who's laughing now,
<i>tía</i> Carmela? MD, baby!

04:23.610 --> 04:25.490
[laughs] That's right.

04:25.690 --> 04:27.120
Why are we mad at <i>tía</i> Carmela?

04:27.320 --> 04:30.080
[groans] She's the one
that's always so concerned about

04:30.280 --> 04:32.500
my life amounting to nothing
because I'm different.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.000
So, tonight, I'm gonna rub this
in her face.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.760
Well, screw her.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.720
Isn't she some life coach
with no clients?

04:38.920 --> 04:40.260
Whoa.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.090
You can't talk about my family
like that.

04:42.290 --> 04:43.470
You just said
you don't like her.

04:43.670 --> 04:45.430
Yeah, I can talk crap.
You can't.

04:45.630 --> 04:47.270
I'm sorry.

04:47.470 --> 04:49.980
I was really only
trying to be supportive.

04:50.180 --> 04:51.870
I know. It's okay.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.330
But don't do it again.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.740
- [sighs]
- What's up, Diaz?

05:05.940 --> 05:09.850
Mm, no, I'm just browsing houses
and looking at prices.

05:10.930 --> 05:12.460
How much do you think
I could sell my hair for?

05:12.660 --> 05:15.090
120 K? 'Cause that's just
the down payment.

05:15.290 --> 05:17.420
Whoa, okay, okay,
stop spiraling.

05:17.620 --> 05:20.130
Look at this dream house.

05:20.330 --> 05:21.800
- Three bedrooms.
- [Nick] Ooh.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.760
- Hello, claw-foot tub.
- Ooh.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.510
Ooh, what's up,
beautiful kitchen?

05:26.710 --> 05:28.270
But the problem is,

05:28.470 --> 05:30.020
I'm never gonna be able
to afford it.

05:30.220 --> 05:32.440
I ran the numbers. It's bad.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.560
Well, I can definitely see you
in that tub.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.070
- Don't make it worse.
- [laughs]

05:37.270 --> 05:39.690
Okay, well,
how about I make it better?

05:39.890 --> 05:43.530
- Why don't I help you buy it?
- What?

05:43.730 --> 05:45.490
Yeah, you know,
I could help you pay for it.

05:45.690 --> 05:46.950
Give you money
for the down payment.

05:47.150 --> 05:49.040
Help you with the monthlies.
No sweat.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.120
I'm sorry, we're talking about
a house here.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.580
- Not a steak dinner.
- I know, I know,

05:53.780 --> 05:55.330
and I've been
thinking about this a lot.

05:55.530 --> 05:58.130
And I know
we're pretty early on, but...

05:58.330 --> 06:00.520
this is pretty great
right now, isn't it?

06:01.940 --> 06:04.010
Yeah. It is.

06:04.210 --> 06:07.950
Okay, so, in success, we will be
living in that house together.

06:09.110 --> 06:11.310
Let me help you out. Come on.

06:11.510 --> 06:13.850
I have lots of money.
I-I have stocks and bonds.

06:14.050 --> 06:16.270
And a trust and gold
in a vault in Switzerland.

06:16.470 --> 06:17.860
This T-shirt cost me $200.

06:18.060 --> 06:20.360
[laughs]

06:20.560 --> 06:21.820
That's so generous,

06:22.020 --> 06:24.910
but I don't think
I'm comfortable with that.

06:25.110 --> 06:26.570
Okay, fair enough.

06:26.770 --> 06:29.950
But the offer is still good,
if you change your mind.

06:30.150 --> 06:32.680
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.580
Big day.
Lots of choices.

06:35.780 --> 06:37.750
- Mm-hmm.
- Now we can go with cheese.

06:37.950 --> 06:39.130
For sure. Right?

06:39.330 --> 06:41.760
But I'm thinking,
I get a meat lover's for me,

06:41.960 --> 06:43.300
get a veggie pizza for you,

06:43.500 --> 06:45.090
then I get a Hawaiian pizza
for the table.

06:45.290 --> 06:47.930
That sounds like something we
should be thankful for, right?

06:48.130 --> 06:49.470
- Question.
- Mm-hmm?

06:49.670 --> 06:50.930
How would you feel about

06:51.130 --> 06:54.240
a real Thanksgiving dinner
tonight, instead of pizza?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.730
Uh, dubious, why?

06:56.930 --> 06:58.860
[clears throat] Okay.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.320
You're not gonna like this
at first,

07:00.520 --> 07:01.530
and when I tell you
the whole plan,

07:01.730 --> 07:02.780
you're gonna like it even less,

07:02.980 --> 07:04.550
but hear me out.

07:05.710 --> 07:06.910
All right.

07:07.110 --> 07:09.450
I saw Gladys today. Mmm.

07:09.650 --> 07:12.240
And we've been invited
to the Diaz's house

07:12.440 --> 07:14.510
for Thanksgiving dinner.
I think we should go.

07:15.850 --> 07:18.100
- [sucks teeth] Okay.
- 'Cause...

07:19.310 --> 07:21.920
Oh. Oh.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.420
I didn't expect that
to be your response.

07:23.620 --> 07:24.970
Whew. [laughs] Okay.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.720
I mean, I got a whole bunch of
arguments worked out.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.720
I mean, you want to hear them?

07:27.920 --> 07:30.010
No. [laughs]

07:30.210 --> 07:31.640
Lily and I have been texting
a little bit, you know,

07:31.840 --> 07:34.270
but, uh, we haven't really
talked since her birthday.

07:34.470 --> 07:37.480
- Might be nice to catch up.
- Really?

07:37.680 --> 07:39.900
Yeah, really. As friends.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.690
Oh. [laughs]

07:42.890 --> 07:44.860
- Okay.
- We can't we be friends?

07:45.060 --> 07:47.250
Okay, buddy. Okay.
Friends, huh?

07:49.840 --> 07:51.740
Is everyone seeing
what I'm seeing right now?

07:51.940 --> 07:53.240
Oh, was it a raccoon?

07:53.440 --> 07:54.620
Because I saw
on the Nextdoor app

07:54.820 --> 07:56.210
there's a raccoon going around
tipping over

07:56.400 --> 07:58.500
people's turkey fryers with
his freaky little human hands.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.580
- [laughs]
- No, Nick. Not a raccoon.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.840
Us. The four of us.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.090
Walking to Thanksgiving
together,

08:05.290 --> 08:07.840
as couples, together. Hello!

08:08.040 --> 08:10.340
We're basically
like a quad couple now.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.180
- Aw.
- That's kind of cute, babe.
- Yeah. Thanks.

08:13.380 --> 08:15.470
Hey, your family finally
gets to be right about me

08:15.670 --> 08:16.810
being the boyfriend,
except this time,

08:17.010 --> 08:18.640
I'm Lily's for-real boyfriend

08:18.840 --> 08:21.150
- and not your fake, secret one.
- That's right.

08:21.350 --> 08:22.610
I have to admit,

08:22.810 --> 08:25.280
I did have my concerns
about you two.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.780
You had your concerns?
You were 100% freaked out.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.820
- I freaked out. I freaked out.
- [laughter]

08:31.020 --> 08:34.870
But it's my rakish best friend
and my starry-eyed sister.

08:35.070 --> 08:36.790
Ooh, rakish? Well, hey, listen,

08:36.990 --> 08:38.460
you did have cause
to be concerned.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.670
[laughs] Well,
the last few months have

08:40.870 --> 08:42.790
been incredible, and
this isn't even the best part.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.590
This is only the beginning.
I mean, think about it.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.170
Vacations in Baja,

08:46.370 --> 08:49.340
raising our incredibly
good-looking children together.

08:49.540 --> 08:52.140
[gasps] Wait, Lil,
are we gonna be neighbors?

08:52.340 --> 08:53.430
I think we should be neighbors.

08:53.630 --> 08:54.930
Oh, my God, we'll be together
forever, then.

08:55.130 --> 08:56.720
This is, like,
the best day ever.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.140
I swear, like, it's like
what we've been dreaming about

08:59.340 --> 09:01.400
- our whole lives. I love you.
- Oh, come on.

09:01.590 --> 09:03.110
Oh, my God, I love you guys.
This is so cute.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.070
[quiet chatter]

09:05.270 --> 09:06.480
- Hey, <i>¡primos!</i>
- Hey!

09:06.680 --> 09:07.900
- Wait, don't wrinkle me.
- [grunting]

09:08.100 --> 09:09.780
- Ah.
- Ah!

09:09.980 --> 09:12.320
- Oh, watch the spine, watch
the spine, watch the spine.
- Sorry.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.700
I got to make up for all
the months I don't see you guys.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.290
Ah, I know, we miss you, too.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.160
Bring it in, Chuey.
Do what you got to do.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.210
<i>¡Órale!</i> [grunts]

09:20.410 --> 09:21.790
- [laughter]
- I know. I know.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.790
How is L.A.?
How is the food truck going?

09:23.990 --> 09:25.420
Oh, so good.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.670
I got into a bit of a turf war
with a taco truck in K-Town,

09:27.870 --> 09:29.880
but I made an offer
they couldn't refuse.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.840
What was the offer?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.300
To alternate days, there's
plenty of room for everybody.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.720
- Oh, okay.
- Except that raw garlic
juice truck.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.810
- [groans] Fuck them.
- [laughs]

09:38.010 --> 09:40.270
Hey, Henry, you got a sec?

09:40.470 --> 09:42.350
Oh, uh, of course,
Miles, what's up?

09:42.550 --> 09:43.650
I need a little advice,

09:43.850 --> 09:45.230
since everyone in the family
loves you.

09:45.430 --> 09:47.920
'Tis true.
How can I help?

09:48.960 --> 09:51.030
I know how important
family is to Sol,

09:51.230 --> 09:53.160
and I want to do this right.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.490
I kind of put my foot in it
earlier, and I was thinking,

09:57.690 --> 09:59.950
if there are rules,
you would know them.

10:00.150 --> 10:01.370
I got you, Doc.

10:01.570 --> 10:03.750
I created a Diaz family wiki.

10:03.950 --> 10:07.340
Okay, so, first rule is, you
don't talk shit about family.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.130
You're not actually family.

10:09.330 --> 10:10.760
Yeah, learned that one
the hard way this morning.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.970
Rookie move. You should've
come to me sooner.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.050
When someone offers you seconds,
always say yes.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.810
Never comment
on Alberto's tattoo.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.810
His father's not over it.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.890
Do not eat the mole
if <i>tía</i> Anita made it.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.400
You know what?
There's a lot.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.690
I-I'm just gonna AirDrop these.

10:26.890 --> 10:28.860
- There you go.
- Okay.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.000
[clears throat]

10:32.130 --> 10:34.110
Wow, it's still downloading.

10:34.310 --> 10:35.800
[exhales sharply]

10:37.470 --> 10:39.260
Oh. Oh.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.710
[softly] Oh, come on.

10:42.900 --> 10:46.210
Lil, you really need to upgrade
your phone. It's always dying.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.460
Going through Zillow nonstop
doesn't help the battery life.

10:48.660 --> 10:52.210
Well, take a break from that
and come get wine drunk with me,

10:52.410 --> 10:54.800
'cause I heard <i>tía</i> Carmela's
laugh and my shoulders...

10:55.000 --> 10:56.010
[whispers] ...they're
in my ears.

10:56.210 --> 10:57.340
- Yes. Let's go.
- [laughs]

10:57.540 --> 10:59.350
Wait.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.390
- Oh, can I have
some more of this, please?
- [Sol] Mm-hmm.

11:01.590 --> 11:03.640
- [Lily] Feels really funny,
I know.
- [Sol laughs]

11:03.840 --> 11:05.980
Hey, Sol,
give me some of your...

11:06.180 --> 11:08.120
[indistinct chatter]

11:09.920 --> 11:11.480
- I say we toss it. What?
- Gladys!

11:11.680 --> 11:12.740
Not in, like, an obvious way.
She doesn't have to know.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.700
What's going on?

11:14.890 --> 11:17.200
Your <i>mami</i> is too polite
and insists on

11:17.400 --> 11:19.700
putting <i>tía</i> Anita's
shitty mole on the table.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.950
Am I the only one that remembers
what happened last year?

11:22.150 --> 11:23.540
- No.
- Too many people,
not enough toilets.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.580
- Ooh.
- Honestly, I'm surprised

11:25.780 --> 11:26.960
you didn't have to,
like, burn the house down.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.790
- [laughter]
- Okay, look, I'll just,

11:28.990 --> 11:31.000
I'll just put it right here
with the lid on.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.840
Okay. Wuss.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.090
Uh, I haven't seen <i>abuelo</i> yet
tonight.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.380
Is everything okay?

11:37.580 --> 11:39.780
Yes, uh, fine, fine.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.270
Okay, well, he hasn't been
sleeping well lately,

11:44.470 --> 11:46.890
but that happens sometimes.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.310
Makes the dementia worse?

11:48.510 --> 11:50.230
Well, yes, a little bit,

11:50.430 --> 11:52.570
but it's nothing
we can't handle, <i>familia.</i>

11:52.770 --> 11:54.070
Well, we'll keep an eye out.

11:54.270 --> 11:55.650
He may mistake you
for someone else,

11:55.850 --> 11:57.400
but as long as
that person is attractive,

11:57.600 --> 11:59.780
- I'm good with it.
- [laughter]

11:59.980 --> 12:01.780
Happy gobble, gobble day!

12:01.980 --> 12:03.450
Hi, <i>¡abuelito!</i>

12:03.650 --> 12:06.620
What are all my favorite people
doing hiding out in here?

12:06.820 --> 12:10.080
- Look at you. You look cute.
- [singsongy] <i>Abuelito...</i>

12:10.280 --> 12:12.210
- [overlapping chatter]
- Let's go. Turn up the music.

12:12.410 --> 12:14.050
Oh, the party's here!

12:14.250 --> 12:16.230
[sighs]

12:20.150 --> 12:21.510
I don't know
why you keep putting that on,

12:21.710 --> 12:22.810
when it's just gonna
come right off.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.640
You should just put it
directly on me.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.350
- Oh, I like that.
- [chuckles]

12:27.550 --> 12:28.890
[both] Mmm.

12:29.090 --> 12:31.110
- Oh, wait, you missed a spot.
- Mm.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.690
[doorbell rings]

12:32.890 --> 12:33.860
I should get the door.

12:34.060 --> 12:36.400
Oh, they can let themselves in.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.690
What if they're a vampire?

12:37.890 --> 12:39.530
Wait, what if...
We should talk this through.

12:39.730 --> 12:41.620
Well, some of them have souls.

12:41.810 --> 12:43.910
And some of them
just want to...

12:44.110 --> 12:46.040
- [growls, laughs]
- [laughing]

12:46.240 --> 12:48.330
- Oh, my God,
you guys are disgusting.
- Oh.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.960
I love it.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.430
[Lily laughing]

12:53.600 --> 12:56.380
- Hey, somebody order a pizza?
- Hi.

12:56.580 --> 12:58.020
[Lily laughing] Nick!

12:59.480 --> 13:01.150
Lily.

13:02.190 --> 13:03.610
Santiago?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.520
My sexy strays!

13:06.710 --> 13:09.390
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
I invited them.

13:09.590 --> 13:11.310
They had no place to go
for Thanksgiving.

13:11.510 --> 13:13.060
It was
the Christian thing to do.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.360
I'm like a saint, a hot saint.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.190
- Thanks for having us.
- Of course.

13:18.390 --> 13:20.450
Oh, eyes where they should be.
My tits are down here.

13:20.650 --> 13:23.030
Yes, they are. [chuckles]
I see that.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.990
[laughter]

13:25.190 --> 13:26.290
[clears throat]

13:26.480 --> 13:28.290
[laughs nervously]

13:28.490 --> 13:31.420
Who wants a drink?
Or two?

13:31.610 --> 13:33.920
I know I do.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.670
- I'll bring this
to the kitchen.
- Yeah, okay.

13:36.870 --> 13:38.520
Mm-mm.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.010
- What?
- Come on.

13:43.210 --> 13:45.720
- Somebody's in trouble.
- Yeah,
I probably need a spanking.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.990
Oh, well, let's get to that.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.480
Lil.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.400
The aged rum your dad likes
should be in that cupboard.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.750
A heads-up would have been nice.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.230
- I texted you.
- You did not.

13:58.430 --> 13:59.790
I definitely did.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.080
Sorry, my phone died.
I didn't get it.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.910
Why didn't you tell me
about Nick?

14:09.110 --> 14:11.160
Because we had a rule,
your rule,

14:11.360 --> 14:12.960
that we weren't gonna talk about
the people we're dating.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.830
Yeah, when it's some random guy,
not when it's...

14:16.030 --> 14:18.050
Not when it's Nick.
That's different.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.420
That's a...
that's a real thing.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.260
You should've given me
a heads-up.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.760
Well, excuse me for not knowing
the nuances of your rules.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.680
- Had I known, I wouldn't...
- What?

14:27.880 --> 14:30.270
- If you had known, what?
- It doesn't matter anymore.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.450
He seems like a good guy.
I'm happy for you.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.630
[whistles]

14:43.460 --> 14:46.160
Finger of rum for you,
triple shot for me.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.780
Dang, kid.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.370
I wouldn't
have suggested we come

14:49.570 --> 14:50.870
if I knew Lily
was dating that dude.

14:51.070 --> 14:52.120
Why didn't you say something?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.830
I didn't know
anything about it, <i>papi.</i>

14:54.030 --> 14:56.040
I just now found out myself.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.460
Wasn't expecting this.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.250
What were you expecting?

14:59.450 --> 15:00.750
I don't know.

15:00.950 --> 15:02.090
Still processing it.

15:02.290 --> 15:05.260
Yeah, well, your face is
processing pretty loudly.

15:05.460 --> 15:06.990
You want to leave?

15:08.070 --> 15:10.180
No. No, no, no. Um...

15:10.380 --> 15:12.810
That's too dramatic.
I'll be fine.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.810
Okay, then, fix your face.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.520
All right?
We're guests here tonight.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.610
Whatever it is you're feeling,
revisit it later.

15:18.810 --> 15:22.070
- <i>¿Comprende?</i>
- [takes deep breath]

15:22.270 --> 15:25.610
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cheers.

15:25.810 --> 15:26.990
To the sexy strays.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.950
Mm.

15:29.150 --> 15:31.160
[both groan]

15:31.360 --> 15:34.100
[laughter]

15:36.930 --> 15:38.920
- Oh.
- Hey, baby.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.920
- Madam.
- Oh.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.150
- Hey, thank you.
- [chuckles]

15:47.360 --> 15:49.150
Oh.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.930
I think they had me right here.

15:54.130 --> 15:56.060
Hmm.

15:56.260 --> 15:58.230
You know, I-I can go
sit with my dad, actually.

15:58.430 --> 16:00.230
[quiet chatter]

16:00.430 --> 16:04.530
No, no, i-it's fine.
Sit here. Yeah.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.110
- Yeah.
- [Santiago] Yeah.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.360
Looks like he's pretty happy
over there anyway.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.950
- I couldn't agree more.
- [laughing]

16:10.150 --> 16:12.160
- So, let's just make sure...
- Oh, yeah.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.430
[indistinct chatter]

16:15.510 --> 16:16.750
[quietly] Sit down.

16:16.950 --> 16:18.580
- All right, shall we? Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.520
Mm-hmm.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.980
[Lily and Santiago
clear throats]

16:29.780 --> 16:32.350
- Hey, uh, fun fact.
- [inhales]

16:32.550 --> 16:33.640
Did you know
that potatoes were

16:33.840 --> 16:35.890
the first vegetable
grown in space?

16:36.090 --> 16:37.810
- What?
- I did not know that.

16:38.010 --> 16:40.310
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Well, technically,

16:40.510 --> 16:42.480
a potato, uh,
is not a vegetable.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.480
It's a starch, but it's pretty,
pretty cool, man.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.650
It is cool, yeah.

16:46.850 --> 16:48.490
Well, nutritionally,
they're a starch,

16:48.690 --> 16:50.820
and botanically,
they're vegetable.

16:51.020 --> 16:53.120
- So... Mm-hmm.
- So you're both right.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.470
- That's nice.
- Hmm.
- [Sol chuckles]

16:57.550 --> 17:00.790
Um, I-I saw an ad
for your gym, man. Congrats.

17:00.990 --> 17:02.880
Oh. Thank you.
I appreciate that.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.670
Yeah, you should stop by.

17:04.870 --> 17:06.710
Not that you need to. You look
like you're in great shape.

17:06.910 --> 17:09.930
But who knows
if your heart is healthy?

17:10.120 --> 17:11.590
Yeah. My heart is good.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.050
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.850
Happy to hear it.

17:16.050 --> 17:17.930
I love you two together.

17:18.130 --> 17:21.900
Michael was nice
but a white guy.

17:22.090 --> 17:26.170
I'm so glad
she is with a Latino now.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.110
<i>Ven, mi amor.</i>

17:29.310 --> 17:31.490
- You're sitting with me.
Come on, honey.
- Okay.

17:31.690 --> 17:33.390
[whispers] I'm so sorry.

17:33.590 --> 17:35.030
[whispers] It's fine.

17:35.230 --> 17:38.410
I'm so, so sorry.

17:38.610 --> 17:39.710
He rearranged the place cards.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.680
- Mm.
- He's a little confused today.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.090
Uh, okay, everybody.

17:53.290 --> 17:55.220
We're going to start
with a prayer,

17:55.420 --> 17:58.100
and then we'll do the
traditional go around the table

17:58.300 --> 17:59.890
and say what we're thankful for.

18:00.090 --> 18:02.600
But, please, try to keep it
to just one thing.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.690
We're all pretty hungry.

18:03.890 --> 18:05.900
<i>Tía</i> Carmela.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.420
[laughter]

18:18.970 --> 18:21.120
Hey, so, you know,
just out of curiosity,

18:21.320 --> 18:24.460
if I were to hand-embroider
"Dr. Sol Perez"

18:24.660 --> 18:27.710
on, say, I don't know,
a lilac silk robe

18:27.910 --> 18:29.840
- for you to wear
around the house, would you?
- Hmm.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.670
Definitely.

18:31.870 --> 18:33.180
[whispers] With nothing
underneath.

18:33.370 --> 18:35.050
Oh. [chuckles] Okay, yep.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.800
I need to learn how to hand
embroider <i>inmediatamente.</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:40.770
- [scoffs]
- Oh, it's not a top.

18:40.970 --> 18:43.020
It's a dress.
How interesting.

18:43.220 --> 18:47.440
Sol, I just wanted to say,
I am so proud of you.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.650
- Oh, wow, thank you.
That means so much.
- [chuckles]

18:50.850 --> 18:53.110
- You did it. You did it.
- I did it.

18:53.310 --> 18:55.530
You landed a doctor.

18:55.730 --> 18:58.410
<i>Tía,</i> I am a doctor.

18:58.610 --> 18:59.870
Miles,
you're a plastic surgeon, yes?

19:00.070 --> 19:01.620
- Mm-hmm.
- Ugh, how amazing.

19:01.820 --> 19:03.330
I mean,
not that I need any help.

19:03.530 --> 19:04.790
But, um,
there are others here

19:04.990 --> 19:06.210
that should probably
talk to you.

19:06.410 --> 19:07.880
- Wow, okay.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.170
Well, you know what,
uh, Sol is actually

19:10.370 --> 19:12.920
the one doing
truly profound work in oncology.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.510
Ah, <i>mira,</i> so sweet, this man.

19:15.710 --> 19:18.720
See, Sol? I'm so happy
not to have to worry any longer.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.530
Now I know
you'll be taken care of.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.650
[Sol sighs]

19:26.840 --> 19:28.730
Okay, I know she's your <i>tía,</i>

19:28.930 --> 19:33.530
but that was a master class in
being nasty while sounding nice.

19:33.730 --> 19:36.150
- Hurt people hurt people,
Miles.
- But she...

19:36.350 --> 19:39.030
- Mm.
- ...seems lovely.

19:39.230 --> 19:42.580
And I'm sure her heart is...

19:42.780 --> 19:44.470
in the right place?

19:45.600 --> 19:46.890
There we go.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.510
- So, your <i>abuelo...</i>
- Yeah.

19:54.710 --> 19:57.340
The dementia comes and goes,
but we're making sure

19:57.540 --> 20:00.970
that he feels comfortable
and safe and not scared.

20:01.170 --> 20:03.970
Unfortunate how it turned out
for Lily, though.

20:04.170 --> 20:07.390
Oh, yeah, I saw.
That was pretty awful.

20:07.590 --> 20:09.860
Yeah. But you know what?

20:10.050 --> 20:11.480
I'm not worried
about Nick and Lily.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.860
I mean,
they're totally solid.

20:13.060 --> 20:15.190
What I am worried about is
our wedding vows.

20:15.390 --> 20:17.240
Because our wedding is
in two weeks,

20:17.440 --> 20:18.530
and right now what I have is

20:18.730 --> 20:19.990
like three and a half
pages long.

20:20.190 --> 20:21.070
Me, too.

20:21.270 --> 20:22.870
Um, four, if you include lyrics.

20:23.070 --> 20:24.410
- Aw.
- Oh, my gosh.

20:24.610 --> 20:27.330
Are you guys talking about
your wedding vows? Aw.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.670
Your father and I never got
a chance to write our own vows.

20:29.870 --> 20:32.210
- Why not?
- We had a Catholic wedding.

20:32.410 --> 20:33.840
We had to stick to the script.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.800
Well, the straights can't
have everything.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.090
- [laughter]
- Well, looking back,
I kind of wish

20:38.290 --> 20:39.840
I did get to write
my own vows for your mother.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.180
I would have had a lot to say.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.010
- Really? Like what?
- Mm-hmm.

20:43.210 --> 20:46.100
Oh, no, you know I don't like
being put on the spot, Bea.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.440
I'm a chef.
I like to let things marinate.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.650
[laughs, gasps] No.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.650
What? What's wrong?

20:52.850 --> 20:54.360
- <i>Tía</i> Anita's.
- Mm-hmm.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.070
- Oh, no.
- [Jorge] Put it down.

20:56.270 --> 20:59.030
- Why is it on the table, Mom?
- [Beatriz] Shh, walk away.

20:59.230 --> 21:00.610
- [quiet chatter]
- [laughter]

21:00.810 --> 21:03.120
Lily,
how's your house hunt going?

21:03.320 --> 21:06.750
Oh, uh, good news is,
I found the house of my dreams.

21:06.940 --> 21:09.210
Bad news is, I'm never gonna
be able to afford it.

21:09.410 --> 21:10.540
- Mm.
- [Lily] So...

21:10.740 --> 21:12.920
Well, no one's first house
is their dream house.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.590
When I bought my place
it was a dump.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.800
I got the crappiest place
on a decent street.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.260
Then I spent
the next couple of years

21:19.460 --> 21:21.760
and a lot of hard work making it
what I wanted it to be.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.430
You should be
looking at fixer-uppers.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.510
Oh, I don't know the first thing
about remodeling houses.

21:26.710 --> 21:28.430
It's not that daunting.
I've been there before.

21:28.630 --> 21:31.830
I still have my contacts,
you know, if you need it.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.940
You know,
I never really thought about it.

21:35.140 --> 21:36.940
Yeah, I'd love to help you.

21:37.140 --> 21:38.940
I'm definitely gonna hit you up.

21:39.140 --> 21:40.650
- [Santiago] Okay.
- [Lily] Thank you.

21:40.850 --> 21:42.450
Wow. I can actually do this.

21:42.650 --> 21:43.870
[Santiago] You can.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.970
[Lily and Santiago laugh]

21:48.970 --> 21:50.960
[laughter]

21:51.160 --> 21:54.170
So, then I said, "Suture self."

21:54.370 --> 21:56.630
[laughter]

21:56.830 --> 21:58.550
You are so funny, Miles.
He's so funny.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.510
Sometimes.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.880
Anyway,
now that Sol's a doctor,

22:03.080 --> 22:04.680
our work schedules
rarely overlap anymore.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.010
I do miss our muffin dates.

22:07.210 --> 22:09.890
- What if you were
his assistant?
- [chuckles]

22:10.090 --> 22:11.730
<i>Tía,</i> I'm an oncologist.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.900
Yes, yes, for now,
but eventually

22:14.100 --> 22:15.270
you'll be taking care
of the children.

22:15.470 --> 22:17.820
Sol, I know you had
a really hard time dating.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.900
Hopefully, this one will stick.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.320
And to think,
so many people were worried

22:21.520 --> 22:22.860
you'd be a disappointment.

22:23.060 --> 22:24.490
Okay, you need to stop.

22:24.690 --> 22:25.870
I don't know who hurt you,

22:26.070 --> 22:28.490
but y-you're done
hurting the person I love.

22:28.690 --> 22:30.910
And, frankly, if this is how
you "life coach your clients,"

22:31.110 --> 22:33.000
they'd be better off
with a pet rock.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.350
[snickers]

22:34.550 --> 22:35.810
[huffs]

22:40.150 --> 22:42.420
- What was that?
- What? I couldn't let her
talk to you like that.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.480
Miles, I told you to stay
out of my family stuff.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.680
You don't know
what you've done.

22:47.880 --> 22:48.970
[Carmela] What kind of
Thanksgiving is this,

22:49.170 --> 22:51.470
when this stranger is
just saying shit?

22:51.670 --> 22:53.850
Who's ready for game night?

22:54.050 --> 22:55.670
<i>Vamos, vamos.</i>

22:55.870 --> 22:57.790
[excited chatter]

23:03.090 --> 23:06.280
Welcome, family, friends,
lovers and strays

23:06.480 --> 23:09.490
to the annual
Thanksgiving Game Night.

23:09.690 --> 23:11.890
[cheering]

23:12.930 --> 23:15.870
- I see you.
- <i>¡Ya, ya!</i>
- [cheering stops]

23:16.070 --> 23:19.710
This is good. All right, fam,
you know the drill. Newbs.

23:19.910 --> 23:21.210
Oh, yeah, this is no joke.

23:21.410 --> 23:22.420
We take it real serious.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.470
This is
single-player elimination

23:24.670 --> 23:25.840
tournament style game play.

23:26.040 --> 23:29.010
That means winner moves on,
loser goes home.

23:29.210 --> 23:31.640
- Oh.
- Weeping in many cases.
- Bye-bye.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.890
Chuey, I'm looking at you.

23:33.090 --> 23:34.640
- Remember last year?
- [others groaning]

23:34.840 --> 23:36.190
[imitates crying]

23:36.390 --> 23:39.210
- [overlapping chatter]
- [laughter]

23:41.500 --> 23:45.840
Okay! So, this year, the
games are, drumroll please...

23:47.960 --> 23:50.370
Running Charades,
Celebrity Marshmallow,

23:50.570 --> 23:52.370
and Face the Cookie.

23:52.570 --> 23:54.600
- Cookie, yes! Yes!
- [cheering]

23:56.510 --> 23:58.080
All right,
so everyone hydrate,

23:58.280 --> 23:59.500
and I'm gonna
put you onto teams.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.640
[lively chatter]

24:03.350 --> 24:05.010
- What? No.
- Yeah.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.090
You're-you're not gonna
take this one.

24:07.290 --> 24:08.760
- We've been practicing. Okay.
- Wait, hold on.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.430
[quiet chatter]

24:10.630 --> 24:12.200
[Jorge] If we have one sip
of alcohol, it's over.

24:16.950 --> 24:18.440
You okay?

24:18.640 --> 24:21.560
Uh, I'm a little, hmm...

24:21.760 --> 24:23.230
"pissed" is the wrong word.

24:23.430 --> 24:25.990
I am circling pissed.
I'm bordering pissed.

24:26.190 --> 24:29.200
I am driving
and waving at pissed.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.740
I... I'm hurt.

24:31.940 --> 24:33.370
I'm hurt, yeah.
I'm hurt, Lil.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.830
Wait, because
I'm talking to Santi?

24:36.030 --> 24:39.540
Of course it's not
because you're talking to Santi.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.540
Look, I get it.
I like the guy.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.290
He's very nice.
He's very smart.

24:43.490 --> 24:45.300
And, you know, even I get lost
in those eyes sometimes,

24:45.500 --> 24:47.720
but that is not it.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.110
- Then what is it?
- [sighs]

24:52.030 --> 24:54.060
I don't love that
you accepted his help

24:54.260 --> 24:55.310
and you didn't accept mine.

24:55.510 --> 24:56.770
The house thing?

24:56.970 --> 24:58.810
That's totally different.

24:59.010 --> 25:00.480
He presented an option
I hadn't thought about.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.310
He's offering me guidance
so I can do this on my own.

25:03.510 --> 25:05.360
Look. [sighs]

25:05.560 --> 25:06.730
I get that
my resources are money,

25:06.930 --> 25:07.990
and his are time and energy,

25:08.190 --> 25:10.920
and that might seem
a lot more noble, but...

25:12.010 --> 25:13.870
Humor me. Okay?

25:14.070 --> 25:16.450
My girlfriend just
turned down my help

25:16.650 --> 25:19.040
and enthusiastically accepted
her ex-boyfriend's help,

25:19.240 --> 25:22.380
in front of me
and her entire family,

25:22.570 --> 25:24.420
at our first Thanksgiving
as a couple.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.190
Shit.

25:27.230 --> 25:28.520
I didn't realize that.

25:29.860 --> 25:32.840
I was raised to accept the ride
but not the cab fare.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.450
- You know?
- [chuckles]

25:37.370 --> 25:41.310
I am so sorry for not being more
sensitive to your generosity.

25:41.510 --> 25:44.460
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.820
All right.

25:51.020 --> 25:52.910
Want to go kick some ass
at games together?

25:53.110 --> 25:54.160
Yes.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.550
[both laugh]

25:57.760 --> 25:59.050
Oh.

26:01.430 --> 26:04.520
- Oh, look at that,
we're on the same team.
- Aw!

26:07.230 --> 26:09.020
- Oh. Hmm.
- Oh.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.180
Oh, I am so sorry
that Santiago's on your team.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.720
I picked names
out of a bowl, I swear.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.100
The universe is using me
as an instrument of its fuckery.

26:18.300 --> 26:20.060
- It's fine. Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.770
Well, I could redo the teams.

26:21.970 --> 26:23.560
- Great.
- No, it'll just be weirder.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.400
- We're all adults here.
- Totally.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.820
Good, 'cause I wasn't
gonna redo the teams.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.440
- [laughs]
- [clears throat]

26:30.640 --> 26:32.420
- Okay.
- Hmm.

26:33.420 --> 26:36.570
[Chuey] Uh, Juanes.
No, Los Tigres del Norte!

26:36.770 --> 26:39.200
- Electric.
- Yeah.

26:39.400 --> 26:43.620
<i>- Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo!</i>
- Yeah. You go! Yes!

26:43.820 --> 26:46.250
Yes, yes, yes! [cheering]

26:46.450 --> 26:48.380
Sol, come on.

26:48.580 --> 26:50.260
Why are you so mad at me?
I was standing up for you.

26:50.450 --> 26:51.510
Because I didn't ask you to
do that.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.300
- [sighs]
- In fact, I distinctly recall

26:53.500 --> 26:54.720
asking you to do the opposite.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.100
Okay, look,
I understand you're upset,

26:57.290 --> 26:58.680
and I want to apologize, but...

26:58.880 --> 27:01.350
[scoffing] But?

27:01.550 --> 27:03.730
But I'm not sorry.

27:03.930 --> 27:06.310
I-I don't regret
what I said to <i>tía</i> Carmela.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.440
Not one bit.
Usually, I back down.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.280
I-I try to let things go,
but I am done letting her

27:11.480 --> 27:13.090
treat you that way
without any consequence.

27:15.090 --> 27:16.990
[group] Movie! Six words!

27:17.190 --> 27:19.280
And were you thinking
about consequences

27:19.480 --> 27:22.450
when you decided to stir the pot
and drive her to tears?

27:22.650 --> 27:23.830
Now she's gone
full-blown drama queen.

27:24.030 --> 27:25.250
<i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?</i>

27:25.450 --> 27:27.130
<i>¿Qué?</i>

27:27.320 --> 27:29.040
How are Carmelas's dramatics

27:29.240 --> 27:32.050
a-and lack of boundaries
your responsibility?

27:32.250 --> 27:33.550
She needs to own her behavior.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.130
Oh, uh, second word, sunshine.

27:36.330 --> 27:38.340
- Uh, uh, <i>You Are My Sunshine?</i>
- [imitates buzzer] That's
four words,

27:38.540 --> 27:39.800
and sunshine is the second word.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.430
"You Are the Sunshine
of My Life"?

27:41.630 --> 27:43.470
<i>- Tía</i> Anita,
that's not even a movie!
- Ay.

27:43.670 --> 27:44.930
Get your head in the game, <i>¡tía!</i>

27:45.130 --> 27:46.810
- [Anita] <i>Ay, dale, dale, dale.</i>
- Look.

27:47.010 --> 27:49.480
Maybe we all wish <i>tía</i> Carmela
would change her ways,

27:49.680 --> 27:51.190
but this is gonna domino-effect

27:51.390 --> 27:53.230
until everyone in my family
is suffering.

27:53.430 --> 27:54.780
Ooh, dusting off, dusting off?

27:54.980 --> 27:55.990
Well, maybe
your family needs to learn

27:56.190 --> 27:57.110
how to deal with that
differently,

27:57.310 --> 27:58.410
because it's not cool,

27:58.610 --> 28:00.200
and I'm gonna stand up
for the person I love.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.120
Oh, you're bald.
You're bald.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.660
- You're bold.
- Mind.

28:03.860 --> 28:05.290
<i>Eternal Sunshine</i>
<i>of the Spotless Mind.</i>

28:05.490 --> 28:08.500
- Yes!
- [cheering]

28:08.700 --> 28:10.500
[laughter]

28:10.700 --> 28:12.500
<i>Vamos a ganar, a ganar.</i>

28:12.700 --> 28:14.210
- <i>Vamos a ganar. ¡Vamos!</i>
- [whooping]

28:14.410 --> 28:15.920
- We got this. We got this.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes. Let's go.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.480
- Uh, film. Film.
- Movie.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.010
- Uh, one word.
- One word. We got this.
- One word.

28:20.210 --> 28:21.300
- [Nick] Yeah. Yeah.
- [Jorge Sr.] Here we go.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.970
- Here we go. <i>Fargo? Jaws?</i>
- Easy.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.520
- <i>Annie. Annie.</i>
- Uh, ooh, <i>Marry Poppins.</i>

28:25.720 --> 28:26.520
Dancing.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.850
One word. One word. Dancing.

28:29.050 --> 28:31.150
Uh, uh, uh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, <i>Sex and the City.</i>

28:31.350 --> 28:33.820
[stammers] <i>Paddington 2.</i>
<i>Paddington 2.</i>

28:34.020 --> 28:34.980
[Jorge Sr.] Dude, dude,
dude, one word.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.530
You can just say <i>Paddington.</i>

28:36.730 --> 28:37.780
- Is it <i>Paddington?</i>
- Is it <i>Paddington?</i>

28:37.980 --> 28:39.200
No, no, no!
It's not <i>Paddington.</i>

28:39.400 --> 28:41.380
Okay, fresh start, fresh start.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.330
[imitates retching]

28:45.530 --> 28:46.700
- <i>Cinderella! Cinderella.</i>
- Yes, Santi!

28:46.900 --> 28:48.580
- Go, Santi, yes, yes!
- That was it?

28:48.780 --> 28:49.960
- Yes!
- What was that?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.540
Oh, I was sick
with food poisoning

28:51.740 --> 28:53.210
when we watched <i>Cinderella.</i>
I think we're gonna win!

28:53.410 --> 28:55.340
- Yay!
- [laughing]

28:55.540 --> 28:57.220
- Awesome.
- Yeah, go us.

28:57.410 --> 28:59.130
Dude,
what's with <i>Sex and the City?</i>

28:59.330 --> 29:01.590
The shoes are a very important
part of the story.

29:01.790 --> 29:03.260
- Oh...
- All right.
- Okay.

29:03.460 --> 29:05.390
- Ready?
- Yeah.

29:05.590 --> 29:06.720
- Film again.
- Movie.
- Movie. Yeah.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.140
- Mm-hmm.
- [Lily] Okay, yeah.

29:08.340 --> 29:09.230
[group] Three words.

29:09.430 --> 29:11.290
- Yeah, I know.
- [Lily] First word.

29:12.540 --> 29:14.070
- [Nick] Girl.
- Uh...

29:14.260 --> 29:15.610
- <i>West Side Story?</i>
- Yes!

29:15.810 --> 29:16.780
- Yes, Santi! Yes!
- Let's go!

29:16.980 --> 29:19.280
- How?
- I pointed west.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.820
Yeah, but how did you even know
where west is?

29:21.020 --> 29:22.700
- It's west, man.
- [Jorge Sr. laughs]

29:22.900 --> 29:24.830
- We won! We won!
- [Jorge Sr.] Yay, we won!

29:25.030 --> 29:27.580
- [Santiago] Yeah!
- We won!
- Hmm.

29:27.780 --> 29:29.910
- We won.
- [laughs] We won.

29:30.110 --> 29:32.000
[laughter]

29:32.200 --> 29:34.000
- We won.
- [whoops]

29:34.200 --> 29:36.440
- Tequila.
- Let's get tequila.

29:38.650 --> 29:40.170
What are you, a mop?

29:40.370 --> 29:41.930
'Cause you just wiped the floor
in that charades game.

29:42.130 --> 29:43.890
Well, I didn't,
but apparently

29:44.090 --> 29:46.350
Lily and Santiago are amazing
together.

29:46.550 --> 29:47.600
You okay, bud?

29:47.800 --> 29:49.350
No.

29:49.550 --> 29:51.230
Do you want to talk about it?

29:51.430 --> 29:55.040
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.460
What's up?

30:02.510 --> 30:06.200
Ah, honestly,
everything was cool.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.080
It's just...

30:08.280 --> 30:09.790
I'm starting
to feel uncomfortable

30:09.990 --> 30:11.210
with Santiago being here.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.040
Yeah. It's a lot.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.420
I mean, you should've seen

30:14.620 --> 30:15.880
the two of them playing
charades together, man.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.020
It was just like...
[clicks tongue]

30:20.770 --> 30:22.340
Wh-What are you doing?

30:22.540 --> 30:24.300
It's two peas in a pod,
clearly.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.300
Wow.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.890
You really are bad
at game night.

30:28.090 --> 30:30.560
Look, I wouldn't read too much
into the charades thing.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.520
Lily would stop at nothing
to win.

30:32.720 --> 30:36.060
- Mm.
- And, you know,
it makes sense to get jealous

30:36.260 --> 30:37.650
when an ex shows up, right?

30:37.850 --> 30:41.030
But, rest assured,
you and Lil are the real deal.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.820
- You think so?
- I know so.

30:44.020 --> 30:46.030
- Come on.
- Okay.

30:46.230 --> 30:47.200
[Jorge] And we got to stop
talking about this.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.280
It's getting really old.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.910
- [muffled grunting]
- I'm going. Go.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.160
[muffled chatter]

30:53.360 --> 30:54.790
Oh, oh, uh, Ashton Kutcher.

30:54.990 --> 30:57.750
- [muffled]
- [Beatriz] Ooh, ooh, better.
Oh, oh, oh!

30:57.950 --> 31:00.420
- Michael Fassbender.
Yes, yes, yes!
- Oh yeah.

31:00.620 --> 31:03.090
- Good one.
- Yes, yes! Yes, yes! Yes, yes!

31:03.290 --> 31:05.640
[laughter]

31:05.830 --> 31:07.350
- [Henry speaks muffled]
- [Lily] What?

31:07.540 --> 31:08.970
Articulate!

31:09.170 --> 31:11.450
- [overlapping chatter]
- [laughter]

31:13.030 --> 31:15.270
In the zone, <i>tía.</i>
In the zone.

31:15.470 --> 31:17.620
- Going down!
- [overlapping shouting]

31:18.710 --> 31:19.900
Be the cookie.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.320
We practiced this.
I'm never gonna forgive you.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.900
- No!
- Oh!
- How could you?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.450
- [chatter continues]
- My money's on Miles.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.660
A surgeon must have dexterity
in their face, too, yeah?

31:28.860 --> 31:32.850
I don't know.
He's been a little sloppy today.

31:34.140 --> 31:37.330
You mean,
what he said to Carmela earlier?

31:37.530 --> 31:39.340
I thought it was fantastic.

31:39.530 --> 31:43.340
Look, I don't need
any more drama in my life.

31:43.540 --> 31:45.720
I had enough of that growing up.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.260
I see them
all over there whispering.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.050
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Beatriz] Oh, no, no, no, no.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.010
They've moved on.
They're talking about Chuey.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.180
[whispers] He got
his L.A. girlfriend pregnant.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.270
- [gasps]
- [chuckles]

31:56.470 --> 31:59.230
Look, I get that
we're protective of our own,

31:59.430 --> 32:03.150
but sometimes <i>tía</i> Carmela needs
to just shut her mouth.

32:03.350 --> 32:05.190
- Mm.
- What?

32:05.390 --> 32:06.950
We can all be annoyed by her.

32:07.150 --> 32:10.320
But if she needed us,
we would be there in a second.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.080
But none of that means that
she gets to be shitty to you

32:13.280 --> 32:16.430
and your partner, who loves you
and has to sit there and watch.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.210
I like that he stood up for you.

32:20.410 --> 32:22.590
- You do?
- Yeah.

32:22.790 --> 32:25.150
And I know
that your mom would, too.

32:26.190 --> 32:28.180
[smacks lips] Look at him.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.890
He's a keeper.

32:30.090 --> 32:32.010
[chuckles softly]

32:32.210 --> 32:34.520
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, he is.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.350
- [Chuey] Come on, Diaz.
- [Gladys] There she goes,
there she goes, there she goes.

32:37.550 --> 32:39.900
- <i>Ahí, ahí, ahí.</i>
- [shrieks]

32:40.100 --> 32:42.620
[cheering]

32:44.210 --> 32:46.860
In your faces.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.320
[laughter]

32:49.520 --> 32:51.370
- [overlapping shouting]
- [groans]

32:51.570 --> 32:53.720
- Come talk to me.
- [laughter]

33:02.390 --> 33:04.420
Listen, we shouldn't have come.

33:04.620 --> 33:05.960
That's on me.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.260
But I-I don't like to see you
all tortured like this.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.130
I'm fine, <i>papi.</i>

33:10.330 --> 33:12.390
Come on, youngblood,
you're lying.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.600
I see the hurt in your eyes
when you look at her.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.810
That's how I looked at your
mother when we first separated.

33:19.010 --> 33:20.410
I know.

33:21.950 --> 33:24.900
- Come on.
- [patting on back]

33:25.100 --> 33:26.750
Let's get out of here.

33:27.790 --> 33:29.570
Yeah, that's a good idea.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.490
Cool, come on,
let's grab our coats.

33:31.690 --> 33:34.330
- Marshmallow games, right?
- Hmm. [chuckles]

33:34.520 --> 33:37.160
Okay, <i>mi gente,</i> shut your traps.
The tally's in.

33:37.360 --> 33:40.210
By a mere two points,
the winner is...

33:40.410 --> 33:43.480
- Chuey Diaz!
- [cheering]

33:44.520 --> 33:47.300
<i>¡Órale!</i>

33:47.500 --> 33:49.170
- That's right, baby!
- That's right. That's right.

33:49.370 --> 33:51.940
- Give me my belt.
- [cheering]

33:55.780 --> 33:57.390
Who's the man? Who's the man?

33:57.590 --> 34:00.530
[chatter, cheering]

34:06.080 --> 34:08.360
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.700
[sighs] I'm sorry.

34:10.890 --> 34:12.360
You're sorry
because I didn't listen?

34:12.560 --> 34:13.910
You were right,

34:14.110 --> 34:15.200
and I lashed out at you,

34:15.400 --> 34:17.030
which you didn't deserve.

34:17.230 --> 34:19.500
You were just
trying to defend me,

34:19.690 --> 34:21.160
and I appreciate it.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.920
Well, I-I should've been
way more sensitive

34:24.120 --> 34:25.420
about your family dynamics.

34:25.620 --> 34:28.920
Yes, but...

34:29.120 --> 34:31.720
you reminded me that
I'm allowed to hold my own

34:31.920 --> 34:33.260
and stand up for myself,

34:33.460 --> 34:35.430
which is way easier to do

34:35.630 --> 34:38.950
with you by my side.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.440
Wait, did we just have

34:46.640 --> 34:48.650
a grossly mutual
and understanding makeup sesh?

34:48.850 --> 34:49.820
I believe we did.

34:50.020 --> 34:51.360
Maybe we should follow it up

34:51.560 --> 34:54.000
with a grossly mutual
and understanding make-out sesh?

34:55.090 --> 34:58.990
I mean, there's got to be
at least one empty room in here.

34:59.190 --> 35:00.910
[laughs]

35:01.110 --> 35:03.060
[overlapping chatter]

35:04.930 --> 35:06.580
Here's to
another fantastic party.

35:06.780 --> 35:08.170
- Yes.
- Well done.

35:08.370 --> 35:09.670
I'm worried about the dishes.

35:09.870 --> 35:12.510
Oh, hey, I wanted to thank you
for having us tonight.

35:12.710 --> 35:13.800
Uh, we've got a job
early in the morning,

35:14.000 --> 35:14.930
so we're gonna be heading out.

35:15.130 --> 35:16.760
Of course,
we completely understand.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.720
We're so happy that you came.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.560
Please know that
you're always welcome.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.640
That's kind.
Thanks again.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.930
Oh, uh, the rack got full,

35:24.130 --> 35:25.810
so I moved your coats
into our bedroom.

35:26.010 --> 35:27.350
I-I'll just go run up
and get them.

35:27.550 --> 35:28.980
Oh, no, no. Don't worry
about it. I'll go grab it.

35:29.180 --> 35:30.320
Okay, it's the first door
on your left.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.650
Cool. I'll be right back, <i>papi.</i>

35:31.850 --> 35:33.150
All right, cool.

35:33.350 --> 35:34.610
Oh, and, uh,
give Gladys my love.

35:34.810 --> 35:35.780
Thank her for me.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.530
And tell her
I'll give her a call.

35:37.730 --> 35:40.790
- Uh... Okay, stop it.
- Run. Just run, bro.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.930
[Beatriz] She's fine.

35:53.110 --> 35:54.520
Hey, Santi.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.220
Hey.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.300
You were gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

35:59.500 --> 36:01.260
I mean, things started off
a little weird,

36:01.460 --> 36:04.270
but I think we ended up
having a good time.

36:04.470 --> 36:07.480
We have this work thing
tomorrow, so...

36:07.680 --> 36:09.000
On the day after Thanksgiving?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.690
What do you want, Lily?

36:11.890 --> 36:14.990
What do I want?
What do you want?

36:15.190 --> 36:16.820
You're the one who came here.

36:17.020 --> 36:20.320
Well, it was a mistake,
which is why I'm leaving.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.510
I just want to make sure
we're cool.

36:25.180 --> 36:26.680
We're cool.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.210
If you came here
to say something, say it.

36:30.410 --> 36:33.420
What do you want me to say?

36:33.620 --> 36:35.380
That I came here
to get you back?

36:35.580 --> 36:38.550
- Did you?
- What's the point?

36:38.750 --> 36:41.010
- You're with somebody else now.
- I think I deserve to know.

36:41.210 --> 36:42.600
And I think I deserved to know
you were seeing Nick.

36:42.800 --> 36:43.810
You told me not to tell you.

36:44.010 --> 36:44.930
I mean, it was your idea

36:45.130 --> 36:46.680
not to talk about
the people we're dating.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.020
Just let me leave.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.560
It doesn't matter anymore.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.120
What doesn't matter anymore?

36:52.160 --> 36:55.030
You want to know? Fine.

36:55.230 --> 36:57.240
I was wrong.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.360
About us, about everything.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.820
The more I've dated other women,

37:02.020 --> 37:04.620
the more I've realized
they aren't you.

37:04.820 --> 37:07.160
I see you everywhere I go.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.420
At the gas station,
at the grocery store, I-I...

37:10.620 --> 37:13.520
[sighs] I can't,
I can't escape you.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.260
But you know what,
I'm finally willing to admit

37:18.460 --> 37:20.130
that I don't want to.

37:20.330 --> 37:23.720
- Santiago, I...
- Look, I hated seeing you
with him tonight.

37:23.920 --> 37:27.990
[sighs] I hated
every minute of it.

37:30.830 --> 37:32.790
Because I love you, Lily.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.610
I love you
more than I hate marriage.

37:36.810 --> 37:38.490
[softy] What?

37:38.690 --> 37:41.410
So, yeah,
I-I came here tonight because...

37:41.600 --> 37:44.170
because I want to be with you.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.300
Just say you want the same.

38:00.150 --> 38:02.800
Wait, I...

38:03.000 --> 38:05.470
I can't do this. I...

38:05.670 --> 38:07.570
No, I shouldn't have...

38:23.630 --> 38:26.280
- Jorge...
- No.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.410
I don't want to hear it, Lily.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.510
Just came
to get <i>tía</i> Anita's coat.

38:31.970 --> 38:33.500
- Please let me explain...
- No.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.560
Okay? Either you tell Nick,
or I will.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.610
[sighs]

38:43.810 --> 38:45.740
[thunder rumbling]

38:47.320 --> 38:49.140
That was weird
that Jorge and Henry

38:49.340 --> 38:50.680
didn't want to
walk back with us.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.770
They were so big
on the quad couple thing.

38:52.970 --> 38:54.410
Yeah.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.610
You're quiet.

38:57.810 --> 38:59.270
Hey, I know
game night is a big deal.

38:59.470 --> 39:00.780
I'm sorry
if I brought the score down.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.440
You know,
I can take an improv class.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.650
Watch a bunch
of Nora Ephron movies.

39:03.850 --> 39:05.590
I need to tell you something.

39:06.630 --> 39:08.720
Okay.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.000
Santiago kissed me.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.420
What? When?

39:14.610 --> 39:16.520
Like ten minutes ago.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.750
Are you for real right now?

39:19.950 --> 39:21.420
I am so sorry.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.430
I had no idea he was
gonna be there tonight. I...

39:24.620 --> 39:26.680
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.140
It just kind of sort of did.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.410
Well, h-how does it
just kind of sort of happen?

39:32.030 --> 39:34.980
As he was leaving,
he admitted he still loved me.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.100
Okay, you know what,
fuck that guy.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.400
- And he didn't mean
to get between us.
- Really?

39:39.600 --> 39:41.190
Because it sounds like
he kissed my girlfriend.

39:41.390 --> 39:43.250
Yes, but...

39:45.170 --> 39:47.130
I kissed him back.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.660
Fuck.

39:49.860 --> 39:51.660
- Lily.
- Look.

39:51.860 --> 39:53.160
I'm not proud of it, but...

39:53.360 --> 39:54.790
but, in the moment,
I got lost.

39:54.990 --> 39:58.040
It was a huge mistake,
and I am so sorry,

39:58.240 --> 40:00.790
and I-I needed to tell you.
I...

40:00.990 --> 40:03.840
I-I don't even know how
to respond to that right now.

40:04.040 --> 40:07.760
Nick, I am so sorry. I...

40:07.960 --> 40:09.400
You head on in.

40:10.820 --> 40:12.320
I got to take a walk.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.450
Alone.

40:33.010 --> 40:35.700
Oh, no, did somebody finish
<i>tía</i> Anita's mole?

40:35.900 --> 40:37.710
Uh, no.

40:37.910 --> 40:40.420
I accidentally threw it
in a trash bag,

40:40.620 --> 40:42.880
double-bagged it, and put it
in our neighbor's bin.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.670
[laughs]

40:44.870 --> 40:46.170
It will not be
traced back to us.

40:46.370 --> 40:48.220
Oh, God, I love you so much.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.970
[clears throat] In fact,

40:51.170 --> 40:54.600
remember when we were talking
with Jorgito earlier about vows?

40:54.800 --> 40:56.520
- Mm.
- Well, uh,

40:56.720 --> 40:58.230
I got a little something
for you.

40:58.430 --> 41:00.400
[gasps] Oh, really?

41:00.600 --> 41:03.210
- [clears throat]
- Oh.

41:05.920 --> 41:09.070
Beatriz Delgado,

41:09.270 --> 41:12.780
the first time
I ever saw you smile,

41:12.980 --> 41:14.410
you took my breath away.

41:14.610 --> 41:16.540
[sighs]

41:16.740 --> 41:18.330
And you have every day since.

41:18.530 --> 41:20.290
And every night, too,
but that's mostly

41:20.490 --> 41:22.290
because your elbow keeps
finding its way into my sternum.

41:22.490 --> 41:23.750
[laughs] Jorge.

41:23.950 --> 41:27.690
- And I vow...
- Mm-hmm.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.930
...to always remember
how you take your coffee,

41:31.130 --> 41:32.800
with just a drop of soy milk.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.680
To protect you from any spiders
that dare enter our home.

41:35.880 --> 41:38.060
[Beatriz laughs]

41:38.260 --> 41:40.740
To never,
ever take you for granted again.

41:43.830 --> 41:46.400
And to love and cherish you
today,

41:46.600 --> 41:49.420
tomorrow, forever.

41:50.710 --> 41:52.700
Jorge.

41:52.900 --> 41:54.580
I know, right?

41:54.770 --> 41:58.200
[both laugh]

41:58.400 --> 42:00.790
Okay, um...

42:00.990 --> 42:04.330
I did not get to plan ahead,

42:04.530 --> 42:06.670
but, uh,
let me take a swing at it.

42:06.870 --> 42:08.670
Oh. [clears throat]

42:08.870 --> 42:10.720
- <i>Ándale.</i>
- Okay.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.430
[clears throat]

42:12.630 --> 42:15.010
Jorge Diaz.

42:15.210 --> 42:19.980
The first time
you ever said I love you,

42:20.170 --> 42:22.100
you made me weak in the knees.

42:22.300 --> 42:26.360
And it still does to this day.

42:26.560 --> 42:31.990
And I-I can't believe
how lucky I am

42:32.190 --> 42:36.490
that I get to wake up
to this hunk of a man

42:36.690 --> 42:38.290
[laughs] every single morning.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.120
Morning breath and all.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.080
Oh, well, hey,
the tongue scraper helps.

42:42.280 --> 42:43.830
No, it really has.

42:44.030 --> 42:46.000
Ooh, ooh.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.880
I vow to always protect you

42:50.080 --> 42:51.880
from <i>tío</i> Quique's
latest pyramid scheme.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.510
[laughs]

42:53.710 --> 42:58.180
And to always save you
the last piece of flan.

42:58.380 --> 43:02.870
And to love and cherish you...

43:04.660 --> 43:09.040
...today, tomorrow, forever.

43:13.590 --> 43:15.280
Well, what are you waiting for?

43:15.480 --> 43:17.890

No, don't.

45:01.710 --> 45:04.180
I'm ready to talk.

45:04.380 --> 45:06.930
[shaky breath] Okay.

45:07.130 --> 45:09.770
I'm not gonna lie,

45:09.970 --> 45:12.860
it really hurts knowing that

45:13.060 --> 45:15.940
you definitely still have
some feelings for Santiago.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.170
- I didn't think I...
- But that's the thing.

45:21.340 --> 45:24.080
I understand how complicated
this whole thing has been

45:24.280 --> 45:25.830
and the history that
you two have together.

45:26.030 --> 45:27.720
I don't like it.

45:28.810 --> 45:29.920
But I get it.

45:30.110 --> 45:32.540
That's incredibly
understanding of you.

45:32.740 --> 45:36.560
And, uh, now
I'm just gonna need the truth.

45:38.570 --> 45:43.890
So I need you to be
completely honest,

45:44.090 --> 45:45.360
not just with me...

45:47.530 --> 45:49.240
...but with yourself.

45:50.330 --> 45:53.940
Who do you want
to be with, Lily?

45:54.140 --> 45:56.080
[shaky breath]

45:58.250 --> 46:00.460
I want to be with you.

46:02.710 --> 46:03.740
Why?

46:03.940 --> 46:06.180
Because you're my best friend.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.700
Because you make me feel

46:09.900 --> 46:11.830
like the person
I've always wanted to be.

46:12.030 --> 46:16.550
And maybe we're not ready
to move into a house together,

46:16.740 --> 46:18.590
but I know you feel like home.

46:18.790 --> 46:21.260
That's a good start.
Keep saying words.

46:21.460 --> 46:23.180
I've known you for forever.

46:23.380 --> 46:25.050
You've consistently
been there for me,

46:25.250 --> 46:26.560
without hesitation.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.720
You want what I want.

46:28.920 --> 46:31.390
And more than that,

46:31.590 --> 46:34.560
you don't make me feel bad
for wanting it.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.830
[sobs] I want you, Nick.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.040
Even if that means not being
friends with Santiago anymore?

46:42.340 --> 46:44.530
'Cause now that's
what I'm gonna need.

46:44.730 --> 46:47.740
- Yes.
- Okay.

46:47.940 --> 46:50.620
Okay. Okay. Yeah. [chuckles]

46:50.820 --> 46:53.330
Wait. Really? That's it?

46:53.530 --> 46:54.790
Yeah, yeah.

46:54.990 --> 46:56.920
[sighs] We're okay?

46:57.120 --> 47:00.630
As far as I'm concerned,
our future can start right now.

47:00.830 --> 47:04.090
- I love you.
- I love you.

47:04.290 --> 47:06.340
[breathing heavily]

47:06.540 --> 47:08.350
I love you. I love you.

47:08.550 --> 47:10.390
I love you so much.

47:10.590 --> 47:12.270
- Mmm.
- Ah.

47:12.470 --> 47:14.990
I love you.

47:21.380 --> 47:24.110
[both sigh]

47:24.310 --> 47:25.880
Want to watch <i>Top Chef?</i>

47:27.010 --> 47:28.990
Sure.

47:29.190 --> 47:32.300
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Understandable.

47:35.770 --> 47:39.000
[sighs] I'll get it set up.

47:39.200 --> 47:41.020
[groans]

48:03.000 --> 48:05.210
[sighs]

48:07.170 --> 48:08.590
[Henry sighs]

48:13.720 --> 48:15.220
What are you doing here?

48:16.640 --> 48:18.890
I'll be in the bedroom.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.860
So?

48:26.150 --> 48:27.680
I told him.

48:27.880 --> 48:29.340
And?

48:29.540 --> 48:32.010
And we had a...
we had a good talk.

48:32.210 --> 48:33.560
Define "good talk."

48:33.760 --> 48:35.770
He was very understanding.

48:35.970 --> 48:38.980
He accepted my apology,
and we're starting fresh.

48:39.180 --> 48:41.690
Wow.

48:41.890 --> 48:45.070
Well, he may have forgiven you,
but I haven't.

48:45.270 --> 48:47.150
Excuse me?

48:47.350 --> 48:50.030
I knew this was gonna happen,

48:50.230 --> 48:52.160
and I allowed myself
to get excited,

48:52.360 --> 48:54.700
but deep down I knew
you were gonna screw over Nick.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.000
Did-did you not hear me?
We're staying together.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.080
Right. For now.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.880
'Cause you're just doing
damage control. You're messy.

49:02.080 --> 49:04.050
- But I just cleaned it up.
- Oh, please.

49:04.250 --> 49:06.760
God, you're still in love
with your ex,

49:06.960 --> 49:08.510
and you're using
Nick as a placeholder,

49:08.710 --> 49:09.930
until you figure it out.

49:10.130 --> 49:12.350
That is so not fair.

49:12.550 --> 49:13.640
You don't know the full story.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.110
Then spare me.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.600
Well, I'm sorry
my first real boyfriend

49:19.800 --> 49:21.230
didn't turn into my fiancé.

49:21.430 --> 49:23.520
And I'm sorry I had
to struggle with my career

49:23.720 --> 49:26.780
because Dad didn't hand me
the keys to the family business.

49:26.980 --> 49:28.990
Everything just falls
into your lap.

49:29.190 --> 49:31.070
- [scoffs]
- So you have no idea

49:31.270 --> 49:32.820
how easy you have it, Jorgito.

49:33.020 --> 49:35.410
It must be real nice to judge
up there from that high horse.

49:35.610 --> 49:37.000
[scoffs]

49:37.190 --> 49:39.870
So the pretty, straight girl
is gonna tell me

49:40.070 --> 49:42.380
that my life is easy.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.790
That's rich.

49:44.990 --> 49:46.960
You're such a cliché, Lily.

49:47.160 --> 49:48.880
Henry was
my first real boyfriend,

49:49.080 --> 49:51.180
because every other man
that I was interested in

49:51.380 --> 49:54.640
was either a homophobe
or closeted or both.

49:54.840 --> 49:57.560
So I have had to work twice
as hard on this relationship

49:57.760 --> 49:59.890
to make it work
because, guess what,

50:00.090 --> 50:01.810
relationships are work,

50:02.010 --> 50:04.020
which you would know
nothing about.

50:04.220 --> 50:07.150
You're so wrapped up
in your fairy tale

50:07.350 --> 50:09.940
and your fantasy that
you refuse to grow the fuck up.

50:10.140 --> 50:13.870
And, guess what, Lil,
it's not cute anymore.

50:14.060 --> 50:16.530
You are not cute anymore.

50:16.730 --> 50:20.160
Oh, says the precious baby boy
who can do no wrong.

50:20.360 --> 50:23.380
I've literally been
the grown -up our entire life,

50:23.570 --> 50:25.420
taking care of you!

50:25.620 --> 50:27.800
I'd appreciate
a little grace as a sister,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.550
who was in the bathroom
with you picking up the pieces

50:30.750 --> 50:32.340
every time you had boy issues.

50:32.540 --> 50:34.970
You know, it-it's good
to know the kind of person

50:35.170 --> 50:37.850
my brother is now that
the bad shoe is on my foot.

50:38.050 --> 50:40.430
This isn't some random boy,
Lily.

50:40.630 --> 50:42.540
Nick is my best friend!

50:44.080 --> 50:46.820
Do you really not see
how this is different?

50:47.010 --> 50:49.070
I don't think
that you fully grasped

50:49.270 --> 50:52.610
how big of a deal this is.

50:52.810 --> 50:55.200
Your mess,
it doesn't just affect you.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.740
It affects me, too!

50:56.940 --> 51:01.250
And when you fuck this up,
which you inevitably will,

51:01.450 --> 51:04.460
we'll all be
cleaning up the mess, forever.

51:04.660 --> 51:06.500
So, Nick may trust you--

51:06.700 --> 51:09.210
congratu-fucking-lations--
but I don't.

51:09.410 --> 51:12.400
- Fuck you.
- Yeah. Fuck you.
