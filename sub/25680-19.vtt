00:02.502 --> 00:03.962
Hey, Frankie.
You got some mail.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.965
Oh! It's from
my Aunt Sylvia.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.341
I hope it's money.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.177
[gasps]
Oh! Glitter!

00:11.261 --> 00:12.721
Why would she
put that in there?

00:12.804 --> 00:14.097
It's all over me!

00:14.180 --> 00:15.598
It's coating my esophagus.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.683
I can't breathe!

00:16.766 --> 00:17.600
[coughing]

00:17.684 --> 00:19.728
You're being a little dramatic,
don't you think?

00:19.811 --> 00:21.521
It's just glitter.
It's fun.

00:23.648 --> 00:24.691
[clock ticking]

00:24.774 --> 00:25.817
[screaming]

00:26.693 --> 00:28.862
Frankie!
It's in my belly button.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.031
And I have an outie.
An outie!

00:32.323 --> 00:33.491
Glitter is the worst.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.869
Once it's on you,
it never comes off.

00:35.952 --> 00:36.995
There's only
one thing to do.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.247
Take down the entire
global glitter industry

00:39.330 --> 00:41.166
one shiny factory at a time.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.209
Yes!

00:43.293 --> 00:45.253
Well, I guess.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.921
Or we can make
a Bizaardvark video

00:47.005 --> 00:48.340
warning people
about the dangers of glitter.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.050
Sure. Sounds easier.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.968
But watch your back,
big glitter.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.094
We're coming for ya.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.056
Hey, guys.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.100
Can you be guest speakers in our class
and talk about making videos?

00:59.184 --> 01:02.145
Sure. But you guys
make videos too.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.438
Why do you want us?

01:03.521 --> 01:07.025
Because you're
the defining voice of a generation.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.402
Wow! Thank you.
That means so much.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.446
Also we have crushes
on two girls

01:11.529 --> 01:13.406
and they're huge
Bizaardvark fans.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.283
I feel like that's
the real reason.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.744
Honestly, I just like to feel needed.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.330
We'd love to speak
to your class.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.290
Anything to foster
young love.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.000
-Thanks!
-You guys rock!

01:24.084 --> 01:25.543
Yeah we do.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.840
[gasps] How did the glitter
get in my bed?

01:31.466 --> 01:32.759
It's on my pillow, Paige.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.135
Where my mouth goes!

01:37.013 --> 01:38.598
<i>♪ Let's go make some videos ♪</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:40.308
<i>♪ Hey! Hey! ♪</i>

01:40.392 --> 01:42.018

01:42.102 --> 01:43.520
<i>♪ Hey! Hey! ♪</i>

01:50.902 --> 01:52.570
Remember, we're gonna introduce you

01:52.654 --> 01:55.156
and then you guys
are gonna talk about Bizaardvark.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.201
Whatever you do,
just don't embarrass us.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.079
Okay, we won't. Just tell us which two
girls you have crushes on.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.956
It's Tiffany and Mallory.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.124
They're in the front row.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.041
[giggling]

02:05.834 --> 02:06.668
[both]
Awwww...

02:07.919 --> 02:08.753
[Rodney]
Okay.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.298
Without further ado,
we'd like to introduce two girls

02:12.382 --> 02:14.843
who are definitely not
our girlfriends...

02:16.052 --> 02:17.762
That's right.
We're totally single.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.764
Please welcome Bizaardvark.

02:19.848 --> 02:20.682
[applause]

02:22.267 --> 02:23.143
Thank you.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.353
I'm Frankie.
This is Paige.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.772
And... Oh no.
She wrote a speech.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.358
The dictionary defines
creativity as--

02:30.442 --> 02:32.610
Yeah, I think you
get the idea.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.071
We make videos, you have questions.
Let's hear them!

02:35.155 --> 02:35.989
[girls]
Ooh! Ooh!

02:36.573 --> 02:38.533
Whoa.
This is a lot of hands.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.326
I'm just gonna
randomly pick.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.997
Uhh... You two.
What are your names?

02:44.080 --> 02:45.498
I'm Mallory.
This is Tiffany.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.127
Ohh. Those are names
we haven't heard before.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.546
Beautiful names.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.840
Very beautiful.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.761
Oh no. I think Frankie likes me.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.096
Nice. Keep your options open.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.682
Oh my gosh.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.642
There's so much I want
to know about you guys.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.186
Like, how'd
you first meet?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.938
You know, I think we could answer
that question better

03:09.022 --> 03:11.191
if this room was situated
a little differently.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.777
Zane, Rodney, why don't you come down
and sit next to the girls?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.905
Yeah, that's right.
Get these other kids out of the way.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.406
Come on.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.825
Just move
the desks together.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.244
[Frankie]
Alright. Ha-ha!

03:24.245 --> 03:27.540
And... Perfect.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.042
I have a question.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.335
Why are you called Bizaardvark?

03:30.418 --> 03:34.589
Wow! You're cute and you ask
great questions.

03:34.673 --> 03:38.093
You are going to make some boy
very happy someday.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.719
I can't remember which one.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.808
Uh, Bizaardvark is a combination
of bizarre and aardvark.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.309
It's called a wombo.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.353
What's your next Bizaardvark video
going to be about?

03:48.436 --> 03:51.940
Funny you should ask,
Mallory or Tiffany,

03:52.023 --> 03:54.150
because we just came up
with a new idea.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.318
We're really excited to shoot it.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.487
Yeah, it's called
"Glitter Glitter Everywhere."

03:57.570 --> 04:00.365
It's about how once you get glitter
on you, you can never get it off.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.118
You literally have to
shake your entire body, like this.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.035
[giggling]

04:06.371 --> 04:09.416
And that dance, my friends,
is called "The Glitter Jitter."

04:09.499 --> 04:11.876
-Ooh, I like that.
-I just made it up. Also it rhymes.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.426
Hey, Willow.
What are you watching?

04:19.509 --> 04:21.845
The new episode
of Lucy Lightning.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.221
Cool.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.348
Which one's
Lucy Lightning?

04:25.432 --> 04:28.768
Uh... The one with the lightning bolt
on her superhero suit.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.563
Nice.
And who's that guy?

04:32.731 --> 04:34.482
That's The Destructinator.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.278
He wants to decimate the Earth and pillage
all of its natural resources.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.280
Uh huh, uh huh.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.283
Is he a good guy
or bad guy?

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
I'm gonna pause this
and watch later.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.204
Wow.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.457
You really love
Lucy Lightning, huh?

04:50.540 --> 04:54.044
I do. She kicks butt,
she loves the environment,

04:54.127 --> 04:57.922
and most importantly, she's a strong woman
and a mother of three.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.301
I wish I could tell her
what a big fan I am.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.427
Why don't you
write her a letter?

05:02.510 --> 05:04.179
From the ten seconds
I've seen of this show,

05:04.262 --> 05:06.014
I can tell she's definitely
the type of person

05:06.097 --> 05:07.223
who would write you back.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.350
Wow.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.019
I never would have thought of that
without you, Bernie.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.356
I'm gonna go write Lucy Lightning
a letter right now!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.399
Great! You go, girl!

05:16.483 --> 05:19.402
Bernie.
What did you do?

05:19.486 --> 05:21.905
I used really outdated slang.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.200
No! About Willow.

05:25.283 --> 05:29.329
Her writing a letter to Lucy Lightning
is a terrible idea.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.748
When she was five,
she wrote to Fred the Furry Bunny

05:31.831 --> 05:33.166
and he never wrote back.

05:33.249 --> 05:36.961
She cried for days
and swore never to hop again.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.464
Poor girl took up skipping
and never looked back.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.343
Man, this could go really bad.

05:44.928 --> 05:45.887
Well, good luck.

05:45.970 --> 05:50.100
You're not leaving,
you're a part of this now.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.476
We're gonna
write a letter to Willow

05:51.559 --> 05:53.436
pretending to be
Lucy Lightning.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.814
Cool. Can I use
my smelly markers?

05:55.897 --> 05:58.066
I don't care.
But no.

06:01.861 --> 06:06.491
Behold! 2,000 pounds
of glitter!

06:07.826 --> 06:10.161
[sighs]
I may have over ordered.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.206
But we're set to shoot

06:13.289 --> 06:15.166
our "Glitter Glitter Everywhere" video.
You ready, Frankie?

06:15.250 --> 06:18.545
I've never been in a room alone with
this much glitter before.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.963
Don't open a window.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.256
Don't turn on a fan.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.341
And whatever you do,
don't make it angry.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.762
Sweet! Barrels!
Let's push them.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.140
Nooooo!

06:30.223 --> 06:33.018
[all yelling]

06:35.979 --> 06:38.440
Oh. The glitter's
wrapped in bags.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.650
What sensible packaging.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.528
What's up, guys?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.572
We just wanted to say thank you
for talking to our class.

06:45.655 --> 06:49.034
Tiffany and Mallory
were so inspired by you guys

06:49.117 --> 06:50.577
they started
their own channel.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.494
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

06:52.162 --> 06:53.413
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
<i>I'm Mallory.</i>

06:53.496 --> 06:54.497
I'm Tiffany.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.498
[both]
And we're Ludicrats!

06:57.083 --> 06:59.586
That's a wombo
of ludicrous and cats.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.046
Ludicrats!

07:02.172 --> 07:04.716
Introducing our first video ever...

07:04.799 --> 07:06.843
[both]
Glitter Glitter Everywhere!

07:08.011 --> 07:09.387
'Cause glitter
never comes off...

07:09.471 --> 07:11.723
Until you do
the Glitter Jitter!

07:13.933 --> 07:14.851
[scoffs]
They ripped us off.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.355
Wait. Aren't they ten?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.648
Don't they need
parental permission to post videos?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.610
<i>Hi, I'm Tiffany's mom</i>
<i>and I approve this video.</i>

07:24.527 --> 07:27.447
Awww. They seem
really close.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.449
"Approve this video"?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.577
Does she approve of her daughter being
an idea stealer?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.371
Ahh!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.540
Loose glitter?

07:37.624 --> 07:41.002
Be consistent
with your packaging, people!

07:48.843 --> 07:51.096
Your girlfriends
stole our idea!

07:51.179 --> 07:52.055
[all]
Awww. Girlfriends.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.477
Paige, how are you not mad?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.646
Those girls
ripped off our...

07:59.729 --> 08:01.231
Everything!

08:01.314 --> 08:04.150
Yeah, but they probably didn't know
what they were doing.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.695
They're ten!
They're clueless.

08:06.778 --> 08:07.612
Look at Zane and Rodney.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.155
What are we talking about?

08:09.239 --> 08:11.157
Sports stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.994
Boys.
Let's chat.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.205
So, Frankie's kinda mad
about the video thing.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.623
Yeah, super mad.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.334
And what those girls did
was technically wrong.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.669
Beyond wrong!

08:22.752 --> 08:23.920
But young love
is on the line.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.589
You're--
You're losing me.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.591
So let's all agree
to make this work

08:28.675 --> 08:31.261
so that two future couples
can live their best lives.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.680
And... I'm out.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.432
We just have to
go find those girls

08:35.515 --> 08:37.434
and explain that what
they did was wrong.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.935
-Come on, Frankie.
-[Zane] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.982
Yeah, that's gonna be a no can do-sie
on the Tiff and Mal sitch.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.194
You guys talking to them
would totally embarrass us

08:48.278 --> 08:49.404
and salt our game.

08:49.487 --> 08:54.701
Oh. We don't want to be game... salters.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.536
Why don't you let us
talk to them?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.830
We'll chat, ten-year-old
to ten-year-old.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.499
Actually, Mallory's
ten and a half.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.168
I like the older ladies.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.670
Trust us.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.756
We know how
to talk to girls.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.218
Uh... Are you guys
gonna say anything?

09:12.302 --> 09:16.014
You've just been standing there staring at
us for like, ten minutes.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.440
Anywho, remember how we're like really
good friends with Bizaardvark?

09:25.523 --> 09:29.652
Well you mighta kinda stole
their glitter video idea.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.654
What?
We stole their idea?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.823
We're sure it was
and honest mistake.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.450
A lapse in judgement.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.619
A faux poo, as they say.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.040
Oh my gosh,
of course it was a mistake.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.375
I feel so bad.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.585
We have to apologize
to Paige and Frankie.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.338
Can we come over
and talk to them?

09:48.380 --> 09:51.299
-To our house?
-Where we live?

09:52.884 --> 09:54.094
Great.
We'll come over tomorrow.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.720
See you then.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.683
Technically this is a date.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.559
You know what
that means, right?

10:02.727 --> 10:03.603
No, I do not.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.773
Me neither.
We should do some research.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.860
Nice. We just got ourselves
an all access pass

10:10.944 --> 10:12.612
to Bizaardvark's idea factory.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.782
That was almost too easy.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.035
You don't think the boys
are on to us, do you?

10:19.703 --> 10:21.162
After you, Tiffany.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.332
No, after you, Mallory.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.709
I think we're good.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.757
We have to write a letter to Willow
from Lucy Lightning.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.300
Since we don't know
what Willow wrote,

10:34.384 --> 10:36.761
let's just keep the response
generic and fun.

10:36.845 --> 10:37.762
Got it.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.265
Dear Willow,

10:40.348 --> 10:41.850
can you believe
how expensive

10:41.933 --> 10:43.810
generic body wash
is getting?

10:43.893 --> 10:45.228
Especially the fun scents,

10:45.311 --> 10:47.480
like vanilla and that blue one
at the grocery store--

10:47.564 --> 10:49.024
What is wrong with you?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.778
Willow is a ten year old girl.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.697
Just write what I say.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.242
Dear Willow,
this is Lucy Lightning.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.494
I love saving trees.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.204
My favorite breakfast
is cereal--

11:03.288 --> 11:04.748
No. No, no, no.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.167
Lucy Lightning
is a patriotic superhero.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.669
Her favorite breakfast would be something
All-American,

11:09.753 --> 11:11.212
like French Toast.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.798
Forget breakfast.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.343
Let's just say
her favorite color.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.137
Plur-quoise.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.349
That's not even
a real color!

11:22.432 --> 11:24.851
[sighs] I should write
this letter by myself.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.730
Amelia! Bernie!
Guess what?

11:28.813 --> 11:31.191
I got two letters back
from Lucy Lightning!

11:36.821 --> 11:38.531
Wait, I sent her a letter.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.699
Did you send her a letter?

11:39.783 --> 11:40.992
Of course I did.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.869
You said, "I should write
this letter by myself."

11:42.952 --> 11:46.331
No. I said I should write
this letter by myself.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.541
I feel like we're saying
the same thing here.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.834
Ugh!

11:49.918 --> 11:51.378
Amelia, are you okay?

11:51.753 --> 11:53.296
You're turning plur-quoise.

11:55.090 --> 11:58.009
These letters have a lot
of opposite information.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.304
This letter says
her favorite animals are dolphins.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.306
This letter says pirates.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.349
Pirates?

12:04.432 --> 12:05.809
So lit.

12:07.268 --> 12:11.815
Her favorite foods
are cereal and French toast?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.067
Her favorite activities
are saving trees

12:14.150 --> 12:16.403
and shopping
for body wash?

12:17.821 --> 12:21.199
Wait, I see
what's going on here.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.325
Okay, fine.
Willow, we--

12:22.409 --> 12:24.411
She's coming over
for lunch tomorrow!

12:24.494 --> 12:25.662
Wait. What?

12:26.996 --> 12:30.208
In my letter, I invited
Lucy Lightning over for lunch.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.877
And in this more
sloppily written letter,

12:32.961 --> 12:35.714
she wrote at the end,
"See you soon."

12:35.797 --> 12:38.091
And tomorrow's soon,
so I better start cooking!

12:41.594 --> 12:43.930
"See you soon?"
Why would you write that?

12:44.014 --> 12:47.183
Okay, okay. I had a real quandary
on how to end my letter.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.269
Okay?
"Love" felt too strong.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.770
"From" felt too cold.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.064
And "Fondly?"
Where am I from, England?

12:55.066 --> 12:57.736
Great. Thanks to your
"See you soon,"

12:57.819 --> 12:59.904
Willow's expecting
a huge TV star

12:59.988 --> 13:02.282
to show up at our house
and eat lunch with her.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.537
Congratulations, you're gonna make
a little girl cry very hard.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.789
Well, there's nothing we can
do about it now.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.041
Take care.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.542
Warm regards.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.585
Sincerely.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.463
Ah, any of those
would have worked.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.763
[knocking]

13:24.971 --> 13:26.890
Dude, that's the girls.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.185
Wait. How's my breath?

13:30.268 --> 13:31.102
[breathes]

13:31.186 --> 13:33.396
Terrible.
Like a man's.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.943
[both]
M'ladies.

13:40.070 --> 13:40.904
[Rodney]
Care to sit down?

13:41.363 --> 13:43.073
May I offer you a footstool?

13:43.156 --> 13:45.241
An ottoman?
My back?

13:47.869 --> 13:50.747
Actually, we'd like to apologize
to Paige and Frankie

13:50.830 --> 13:53.500
before we do...
whatever this is.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.211
They're upstairs.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.837
It would be our honor
to escort you there.

13:57.921 --> 13:58.922
After you.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.174
Yes, after you, madames.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.347
Oh, they're already upstairs.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.306
Should we go up?

14:08.390 --> 14:09.349
No.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.851
That's just what they'll be
expecting us to do.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.604
Man, you really know girls.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.524
[knocking]

14:17.982 --> 14:18.942
Come in!

14:21.319 --> 14:24.155
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.491
It's the copy-crats.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.286
Or the girls who made
an honest mistake

14:30.370 --> 14:33.707
but only because
they're little kids... crats.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.668
Yeah, about that.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.962
The boys talked to us
and told us that you were upset.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.047
We're so sorry.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.382
We weren't trying to copy you.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.844
Yeah? Well, you're gonna
need a better explanation than that.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.055
We love Bizaardvark
and think you you guys are so cool

14:49.139 --> 14:50.932
and we were just trying
to be like you

14:51.016 --> 14:52.100
because you're our heroes.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.185
All right, that'll do.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.440
Well, we should probably
get back to the guys...

14:58.523 --> 15:01.943
Oh, I see
what's going on here!

15:03.278 --> 15:05.697
You two "stole our idea"

15:05.780 --> 15:09.200
so you could come over
and "apologize to us,"

15:09.284 --> 15:11.494
but really you just
wanted to hang out with the boys.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.913
Ah! I love love!

15:15.123 --> 15:17.042
Yep. You got us.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.752
Please don't tell
Zane and Reggie.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.961
You mean Rodney.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.631
To you he's Rodney.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.301
But to me, he's Reggie.

15:27.302 --> 15:28.386
Aww.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.598
Oh shoot, Mel, my mom's here
to pick us up early.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.600
We're so sorry,
Paige and Frankie.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.018
Thank you for hearing us out.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.353
It'll never happen again.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.900
Huh.
Those two weren't so bad.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.526
Maybe you were right.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.779
Frankie, when are you
gonna realize...

15:45.862 --> 15:47.947
I. Know. People.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.700
And people. Are. Good.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.161
You know I hate it when you do

15:53.244 --> 15:55.121
that over dramatic
pause thing, right?

15:55.205 --> 15:57.082
But how else.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.167
Would you know.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.294
You're wrong?

16:01.378 --> 16:03.713
That would actually be
a good video idea.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.840
"Over dramatic Pause."

16:05.924 --> 16:08.968
Like over dramatic paws,

16:09.052 --> 16:11.221
about a pretentious dog actor

16:11.304 --> 16:14.307
who believes all his movies
are Paw-scar worthy.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.184
-[giggling]
-I'll go write that down.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.771
Paige. Where's our
idea notebook?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.025
[gasps]
Oh my gosh.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.528
They stole all our video ideas!

16:26.611 --> 16:28.321
Why are we still
using a notebook?

16:28.405 --> 16:30.281
I've been telling you
we should go digital!

16:30.365 --> 16:32.617
I told you once,
I'll tell you again.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.661
I don't trust the cloud!

16:40.834 --> 16:42.043
-You worked up?
-Oh yeah.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.545
So what do we gonna do
about the boys?

16:43.628 --> 16:45.338
The boys?

16:45.380 --> 16:47.716
No, I was talking about
getting back at those evil little girls.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.051
Frankie, Zane and Rodney are our friends

16:50.135 --> 16:51.803
and they're gonna be crushed
when they find out

16:51.886 --> 16:54.305
Tiffany and Mallory
were just using them to steal our ideas.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.391
Those girls are liars!

16:56.474 --> 16:58.893
They need to learn
not to mess with Bizaardvark.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.353
Frankie,
this isn't about us,

17:00.437 --> 17:02.063
it's about
Zane and Reggie.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.441
-Rodney.
-Ugh! She put it in my head.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.234
But he does
look like a Reggie.

17:07.610 --> 17:10.155
Look, I know you believe
in nonsense like love

17:10.238 --> 17:11.948
and children
having a purpose,

17:12.032 --> 17:14.701
but the right play here
is revenge.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.746
And when Zane and Reggie
know what they did, they'll agree.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.248
He does look like a Reggie!

17:22.751 --> 17:25.337
Hey guys, we need to talk
about Tiffany and Mallory.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.254
[both]
We're listening.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.674
Um, so this may
be hard to hear,

17:29.758 --> 17:32.719
but they only
pretended to like you to get close to us.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.890
Now, I have several
revenge options I can interest you in.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.059
Are you looking for
something demoralizing

17:39.142 --> 17:41.227
or something that will
scar them for life?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.396
That won't be necessary.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.648
I kinda wanna see
what's in the briefcase...

17:46.691 --> 17:48.234
We're not the revenge types.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.945
It's kinda immature,
don't you think?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.073
But those girls
are making fools out of you.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.158
-Don't you want to get back at them?
-No.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.077
Ahh! I almost got
a peek that time!

17:57.160 --> 17:57.994
[sighs]

17:58.078 --> 18:00.246
Ladies, we appreciate you
looking out for us.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.750
But a three day relationship
can really change a man.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.086
We'll handle it.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.046
Sometimes not getting revenge

18:08.129 --> 18:09.631
is the best revenge.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.300
No, the best revenge
is revenge!

18:12.384 --> 18:15.261
Am I the only horrible
person in this house?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.181
Agh, she took the briefcase!

18:25.397 --> 18:28.274
I hope Lucy Lightning
likes jalapeño poppers.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.947
What are we gonna do?

18:34.030 --> 18:37.325
Willow is gonna be crushed
when Lucy Lightning doesn't show up.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.202
She's just a kid.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.664
Don't worry. I wrote Willow a new letter
from Lucy Lightning.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.166
Dear Willow,
I can't come to lunch.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.252
I have a cat funeral to attend.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.795
Meee-ouch.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.340
Did you go with cat funeral

18:52.424 --> 18:54.092
just so you could say "meee-ouch?"

18:54.175 --> 18:55.343
Oh yeah.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.596
What would Lucy Lightning do?

19:02.142 --> 19:02.976
I have an idea.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.478
Bernie, do not
show Willow that letter.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.064
Just go out there
and stall her for a few minutes.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.861
Okay Willow,
prepare to meet the small talk master.

19:16.698 --> 19:17.949
Hey, Lil Will.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.409
Hey Bernie.
How are you?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.202
Uh... Uh...

19:21.286 --> 19:22.954
Lucy Lightning's
at a cat funeral!

19:25.790 --> 19:27.917
Excuse me, citizens.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.337
I'm looking for Willow Duckworth.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.797
[both]
I'm Willow Duckworth!

19:34.132 --> 19:36.384
I'm so excited to meet you,
Lucy Lightning!

19:36.468 --> 19:37.927
It's an honor.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.138
Jalapeño popper?

19:46.436 --> 19:48.938
It is I, Lucy Lightning!

19:49.022 --> 19:51.566
Here to have lunch
with an adorable little--

19:52.650 --> 19:54.527
Oh boy,
it's Lucy Lightning.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.823
Yes! That is the real
Lucy Lightning.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.368
Which means you
must be her evil

20:01.451 --> 20:04.329
and not quite as
professionally dressed clone!

20:05.372 --> 20:07.248
That seemed like
an unnecessary drive-by.

20:09.125 --> 20:13.296
But yes, since the real
Lucy Lightning's here,

20:13.380 --> 20:16.174
and this might be confusing
for a little girl,

20:16.257 --> 20:20.387
there's only one thing
for an evil clone to do...

20:20.470 --> 20:22.764
go hang out
in the Game Room.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.808
Or you could fight!

20:24.891 --> 20:26.267
Bernie!

20:26.351 --> 20:31.147
I mean, random,
balding citizen.

20:32.649 --> 20:33.942
There's no need
for us to--

20:34.025 --> 20:35.026
Yay! Fight!

20:38.238 --> 20:39.364
What's happening?

20:39.447 --> 20:41.950
Uh... Not sure.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.160
Let's just pretend to fight
for a couple of seconds,

20:44.244 --> 20:45.453
then you go down and I win.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.288
Uh, I'm the superhero here,

20:47.372 --> 20:48.581
so if anyone's
going down, it's you.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.291
Fair enough.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.795
Lucy Lightning!
Stun her with your power band!

20:53.878 --> 20:55.213
Right!

20:55.296 --> 20:57.382
Pretend to die when I touch you.
Keep it simple.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.759
[suspenseful music playing]

21:00.218 --> 21:01.761
Agh!

21:01.845 --> 21:03.221
-[gasps]
-Oh!

21:03.888 --> 21:05.390
[groaning]

21:07.183 --> 21:12.564
All I ever wanted was to be the most
beautiful evil clone who ever lived.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.315
And I have
achieved that goal.

21:15.233 --> 21:20.655
But the real Lucy Lightning
was too smart for me to win this battle.

21:20.739 --> 21:23.867
Time... to die.

21:26.578 --> 21:27.704
[applause]

21:29.289 --> 21:30.707
What is this house?

21:33.043 --> 21:34.711
That was great, Meels.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.505
You really got
the world of Lucy Lightning

21:37.589 --> 21:38.965
even though
in your fake letter,

21:39.049 --> 21:41.384
you didn't seem to know
anything about it at all.

21:42.594 --> 21:45.513
Wait, you knew
the letters were fake?

21:45.597 --> 21:46.765
Of course I did.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.309
One of them smelled
like "Amelia, the Perfume,"

21:49.392 --> 21:50.935
and the other one
had stationery

21:51.019 --> 21:53.146
that said "From the Desk
of Bernie Schotz."

21:53.229 --> 21:54.522
That one was mine!

21:56.358 --> 21:58.443
Why didn't you tell us you knew?

21:58.526 --> 22:00.195
You were trying so hard.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.614
I didn't want to
break your hearts.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.991
You're just kids.

22:08.495 --> 22:12.457
Tiff, I know our relationship
can weather any storm,

22:12.540 --> 22:15.335
so I'm just gonna come
right out and ask.

22:15.418 --> 22:18.505
Did you guys use us
just to get close to Bizaardvark?

22:18.588 --> 22:20.048
Yeah, we sure did.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.260
Mal, I thought we had
something special.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.679
We don't.
Never have.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.016
Look, there's a right way
and a wrong way to go about life,

22:30.100 --> 22:32.644
-and I think--
-We don't care what you think.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.062
We're done with you guys.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.397
Can you move away?

22:35.480 --> 22:38.441
Oh. Okay.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.490
I know what you girls are doing.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.367
And since I have the benefit
of experience--

22:47.450 --> 22:49.077
Doesn't that
just mean you're old?

22:49.160 --> 22:51.579
Old? Pfft!

22:51.663 --> 22:53.206
Can an old person do this?

22:55.667 --> 22:56.626
Ow.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.921
That was terrible.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.590
Oh, and by the way,
thanks for your ideas.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.384
We took five of them.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.385
The rest were lame.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.804
Just like Zane and Rodney are lame.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.598
[both] Lame lame lame lame
lame lame lame.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.731
You still got
that revenge plan?

23:18.690 --> 23:19.816
Oh yeah.

23:24.571 --> 23:28.074
No way! Our first piece
of Ludicrats fan mail?

23:34.831 --> 23:35.874
[suspenseful music playing]

23:36.958 --> 23:38.126
[girls screaming]

23:41.046 --> 23:42.422
I can't get it off!

23:42.505 --> 23:43.673
Ugh, it's everywhere!

23:43.757 --> 23:47.010
Nobody messes with Bizaardvark!

23:47.093 --> 23:49.804
Or Zane and Rodney!
Right guys?

23:49.929 --> 23:50.930
Guys?

23:51.014 --> 23:52.640
Here, we'll help you with that.

23:52.724 --> 23:53.641
We're so sorry.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.810
Take us back, m'ladies.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.647
Why do we do anything?
