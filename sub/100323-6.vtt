WEBVTT

00:05.469 --> 00:06.791
I didn't like it.

00:07.295 --> 00:09.596
What? What didn't you like about that?

00:09.629 --> 00:12.299
It was boring. It was
in black and white.

00:12.333 --> 00:15.003
Yes, yes. Black and white is good.

00:15.036 --> 00:17.170
Long takes are good.

00:17.204 --> 00:18.606
And it was projected on

00:18.638 --> 00:21.209
honest-to-goodness
film.

00:21.242 --> 00:22.844
Film, you should know,
is actually more soothing

00:22.876 --> 00:24.945
to the brain than video.

00:24.978 --> 00:26.547
It's called the flicker effect.

00:26.580 --> 00:27.649
That wasn't film.

00:27.681 --> 00:28.882
Yes, it was.

00:28.916 --> 00:30.652
No, Dad, it wasn't.

00:30.684 --> 00:31.518
When you were out getting popcorn,

00:31.552 --> 00:34.055
they projected the
DVD menu and hit play.

00:34.088 --> 00:35.189
The same thing happened last week

00:35.222 --> 00:36.691
when you made me watch that documentary

00:36.723 --> 00:38.191
on Michael Keaton.

00:38.225 --> 00:39.326
Buster Keaton.

00:39.359 --> 00:40.561
Ha ha!

00:40.594 --> 00:42.129
Excuse me.

00:40.594 --> 00:42.129
Yeah.

00:42.162 --> 00:43.931
Do you know what happened to Susan?

00:43.964 --> 00:45.198
Oh, uh, sorry, no.

00:45.231 --> 00:47.869
We don't know a Susan.

00:47.902 --> 00:48.902
The point is, that was

00:48.936 --> 00:50.103
a really great movie,

00:50.137 --> 00:51.105
and you're a better person

00:51.137 --> 00:51.939
for having seen it.

00:51.972 --> 00:55.009
Hmm. I still feel like the same old me.

01:04.352 --> 01:05.554
Ha!

01:09.022 --> 01:10.125
What the hell?

01:24.304 --> 01:25.306
Dad?

01:26.774 --> 01:27.909
Get in the car.

01:36.283 --> 01:37.251
Hey.

01:37.284 --> 01:38.286
Hi.

01:38.319 --> 01:39.653
Come in.

01:42.222 --> 01:46.093
Boy, you, uh... You cleaned.

01:46.126 --> 01:47.128
I did.

01:48.929 --> 01:52.367
Hey, uh, we're just getting coffee.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.369
Why did you bleach your apartment?

01:54.402 --> 01:56.137
Well, even though it's
our third coffee date,

01:56.170 --> 01:57.739
you wanted to see my apartment,

01:57.772 --> 01:59.741
which initially I actually
thought was kind of odd,

01:59.774 --> 02:01.141
but then I remembered
that I was actually

02:01.174 --> 02:02.876
the one that said you should
meet me at my apartment,

02:02.909 --> 02:05.379
and then I realized I
have not had company in...

02:05.412 --> 02:07.649
4 years, so, I should
probably open up a window.

02:07.681 --> 02:08.716
You know, air out the place.

02:10.183 --> 02:12.052
Are you ok with this?

02:12.086 --> 02:13.054
With what?

02:13.086 --> 02:14.855
Taking things slow.

02:14.889 --> 02:17.191
Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm good with that.

02:17.223 --> 02:18.759
Good, because, um...

02:18.793 --> 02:20.962
Whenever I've taken things fast,

02:20.995 --> 02:22.764
I've been disappointed.

02:22.796 --> 02:25.766
I know the feeling.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.701
A-and I know what "fast" means to me,

02:27.735 --> 02:30.304
but in your book, when you say "fast,"

02:30.336 --> 02:31.472
do you mean...

02:31.536 --> 02:33.826
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

02:33.826 --> 02:35.308
Please.

02:36.877 --> 02:37.879
Hey, what's up?

02:37.912 --> 02:39.447
We have a case that's urgent.

02:39.479 --> 02:40.381
All right. I'll be right in.

02:40.414 --> 02:43.150
Spencer, there's
something you need to know.

02:43.183 --> 02:45.319
Uh-huh. All right. Understood.

02:49.289 --> 02:51.725
- Work.
- Yeah.

02:51.758 --> 02:53.093
It's ok. Coffee can wait.

02:53.127 --> 02:54.295
Go save a life.

02:58.299 --> 02:59.766
Catch me up.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.768
Early this morning,

03:00.800 --> 03:02.169
Garcia got an email from

03:02.203 --> 03:03.837
an anonymous server.

03:03.871 --> 03:05.772
She's not obscuring her face,

03:05.806 --> 03:08.042
telling us she's got nothing to hide.

03:08.074 --> 03:09.911
- Any ideas on the victims or unsub?
- No.

03:09.943 --> 03:12.045
Only the unsub's demand.

03:12.079 --> 03:13.715
That we release Catherine Adams

03:13.747 --> 03:15.215
in 24 hours.

03:15.248 --> 03:17.185
I'm having her transferred
here for questioning,

03:17.217 --> 03:18.786
but we have no illusions.

03:18.818 --> 03:20.153
This is just a game to her.

03:20.187 --> 03:21.723
We know that.

03:21.756 --> 03:24.192
The question is, do we
want to play it or not?

03:39.006 --> 03:40.441
She's a contract killer?

03:40.473 --> 03:43.110
Yeah, but she's much,
much more than that, too.

03:43.144 --> 03:44.177
She's a black widow.

03:44.211 --> 03:45.780
She preys on men she can seduce.

03:45.812 --> 03:48.215
She thrives on psychological seduction.

03:48.248 --> 03:50.183
Had a body count which
was never confirmed

03:50.217 --> 03:52.286
but it's believed to be in the hundreds.

03:52.318 --> 03:53.787
She's one of the most
dangerous criminals

03:53.820 --> 03:54.889
we've ever arrested,

03:54.921 --> 03:56.924
and she is obsessed with Reid.

03:56.956 --> 03:58.793
He's the only man to ever outsmart her.

04:10.570 --> 04:12.539
Classic negotiating technique.

04:12.573 --> 04:14.342
First one who speaks loses, right?

04:14.375 --> 04:16.076
You arranged the
kidnapping of two people

04:16.110 --> 04:17.944
and you did it the same
way you did it before,

04:17.978 --> 04:19.346
through a partner on the outside.

04:19.379 --> 04:22.048
But her demand, "release Cat Adams,"

04:22.081 --> 04:23.317
that will never happen.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.119
So, tell me what you want right now,

04:25.151 --> 04:27.320
before I send you back to prison.

04:27.353 --> 04:28.355
Oh.

04:29.589 --> 04:31.992
You don't know, do you?

04:32.026 --> 04:34.162
I stopped fighting.

04:34.194 --> 04:35.930
Fighting what?

04:35.963 --> 04:38.366
The United States
versus Catherine Adams.

04:41.302 --> 04:42.870
I had my lawyer plead guilty

04:42.903 --> 04:44.405
to all 73 counts...

04:46.473 --> 04:49.043
And request the death penalty.

04:49.076 --> 04:50.512
Oh, you've grown a conscience now?

04:52.079 --> 04:53.281
I don't think so.

04:53.314 --> 04:59.987
I'm bored, ok? Boooored.

05:00.019 --> 05:01.990
Death has to be more
interesting than this.

05:03.357 --> 05:05.326
But it is funny, you know, when you...

05:05.358 --> 05:06.960
When you're counting the days left,

05:06.993 --> 05:10.297
you really do ask yourself,

05:10.331 --> 05:12.066
"what didn't I do?"

05:15.356 --> 05:20.195
And the only thing I
could come up with was...

05:22.029 --> 05:23.265
You.

05:23.298 --> 05:25.167
You haven't done me?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.902
Sexually violated me in Mexico.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.804
I did? Are you sure?

05:28.837 --> 05:31.307
The drugs that made you hallucinate,

05:31.339 --> 05:33.642
they flood your brain
with serotonin, right?

05:33.674 --> 05:34.676
So, what does that mean

05:34.710 --> 05:36.678
when it comes to...

05:36.712 --> 05:38.681
It's similar to MDMA. It's hard to...

05:38.714 --> 05:41.050
That's right.

05:41.082 --> 05:43.152
Stop being the boy who
cried rape, Spencie.

05:43.185 --> 05:44.253
It's not a good look.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.657
Plus, we... we don't have a lot of time.

05:48.690 --> 05:50.024
For what?

05:50.058 --> 05:54.229
I would like to go
on a date... With you.

05:54.262 --> 05:55.964
- A date?
- Yes.

05:55.998 --> 05:57.599
I want to look pretty.

05:59.267 --> 06:00.969
And I want to have fun.

06:01.003 --> 06:03.137
And I won't even get physical, ok?

06:03.171 --> 06:04.339
Unless you want me to.

06:07.709 --> 06:10.679
Come here. Closer.

06:10.712 --> 06:13.248
The only date that I'll be there for

06:13.281 --> 06:14.249
is the one where they stick

06:14.282 --> 06:15.618
a needle in your vein.

06:18.854 --> 06:20.656
You're gonna let a
father and daughter die?

06:20.688 --> 06:21.756
I don't think so.

06:21.789 --> 06:22.857
I never said father and daughter.

06:22.890 --> 06:24.359
You're already slipping.

06:24.392 --> 06:27.729
We'll find them. We always do.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.897
Not tonight.

06:30.866 --> 06:32.000
Tonight I win.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.705
The score between me
and you is two to zero.

06:36.738 --> 06:38.374
By tomorrow morning,
it'll be a clean sweep.

06:40.842 --> 06:42.978
Enjoy eternal nothingness.

06:43.010 --> 06:44.212
It's a metaphor for your life.

06:49.418 --> 06:51.286
Nice to see you, too, Spencie.

07:10.871 --> 07:11.873
Aah!

07:52.266 --> 07:54.173
- Victimology's off.
- How so?

07:54.335 --> 07:55.896
Father and daughter. She's
never done that before.

07:55.896 --> 07:58.632
She usually kills men that
remind her of her father.

07:58.665 --> 08:00.968
Children, even adult
children, are off limits.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.103
Do we have an I.D. yet?

08:02.136 --> 08:03.138
No. No one's even reported these two

08:03.170 --> 08:04.139
as missing.

08:04.172 --> 08:05.173
You'd think a wife, a mom,

08:05.206 --> 08:06.174
someone would notice.

08:06.206 --> 08:07.175
What do we know about the partner

08:07.207 --> 08:08.175
who was helping her?

08:08.209 --> 08:09.043
It's got to be someone from her prison.

08:09.077 --> 08:11.846
She hasn't had contact with anyone else.

08:11.879 --> 08:13.114
We can start with known associates

08:13.146 --> 08:14.848
who were recently released.

08:14.882 --> 08:15.850
Ok, can I tell you what's

08:15.882 --> 08:17.084
bugging me?

08:17.117 --> 08:18.786
Every time we've gone up against Cat,

08:19.086 --> 08:20.589
there's the presenting agenda

08:20.622 --> 08:21.622
and the hidden one.

08:21.656 --> 08:22.691
If she sticks to pattern,

08:22.723 --> 08:25.060
this isn't just about
going on a date with Spence.

08:25.093 --> 08:26.761
Right now, she's a fixed variable.

08:26.793 --> 08:28.262
We need to focus on
identifying the unsub

08:28.295 --> 08:29.730
and her victims.

08:33.267 --> 08:35.003
What the...

08:39.907 --> 08:41.275
Yeah, I was calling about the flyer.

08:41.308 --> 08:42.842
You know, the guy who killed that woman?

08:42.876 --> 08:43.844
Call me back, I guess.

08:44.812 --> 08:45.712
Hi. I'm on Fourth Street

08:45.746 --> 08:48.882
and my car has been
papered over... papered...

08:48.916 --> 08:50.018
with these flyers about this woman.

08:51.186 --> 08:52.554
Who the hell put this flyer on my car?

08:52.586 --> 08:54.788
I'm one of the small business owners

08:54.822 --> 08:56.256
on Fourth Street and I'm calling...

08:56.289 --> 08:58.692
I'm calling about the
dead woman on the flyer.

09:00.894 --> 09:01.895
Hey, you.

09:01.928 --> 09:03.163
Hey. How's your day going?

09:03.197 --> 09:04.164
Amazing, actually.

09:04.197 --> 09:06.033
I got a call from my headhunter

09:06.067 --> 09:08.135
about a position at the Smithsonian

09:08.168 --> 09:10.071
creating programs for people

09:10.104 --> 09:11.105
with disabilities.

09:11.139 --> 09:13.274
I am drooling I want it so bad.

09:13.307 --> 09:14.875
You're gonna get it.

09:14.908 --> 09:18.245
Hey, um... Are you ready to tell me

09:18.278 --> 09:20.849
about what's been going on, because

09:20.881 --> 09:22.250
there is something.

09:22.283 --> 09:23.752
It's an old case. A woman I arrested

09:23.784 --> 09:25.086
that I thought I was done with.

09:25.119 --> 09:29.391
Well, we could talk
about it tonight, maybe.

09:29.423 --> 09:31.091
Could be our first nighttime date.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.160
Only if we don't talk
about any of this, ok?

09:33.193 --> 09:34.862
I don't want to waste
another second on her.

09:34.895 --> 09:35.996
Her?

09:36.029 --> 09:37.231
It.

09:36.029 --> 09:37.231
It.

09:37.264 --> 09:38.033
I, uh...

09:38.066 --> 09:39.401
It just... it sounded like you said...

09:39.433 --> 09:41.368
I have to go. Keep me posted.

09:41.402 --> 09:43.972
Right. You... you, too.

09:44.004 --> 09:46.040
Bye.

09:46.073 --> 09:47.875
Well? What are her demands?

09:47.908 --> 09:49.744
She wants to go ice skating

09:49.777 --> 09:51.211
so she can skate circles around you.

09:51.245 --> 09:52.279
She's wasting our time.

09:52.312 --> 09:53.747
Ok, something

09:53.780 --> 09:55.816
weird happened, but it could be a lead.

09:55.850 --> 09:57.985
I just got a bazillion
voice mail messages,

09:58.019 --> 10:00.221
all from the same
address on Fourth Street.

10:07.028 --> 10:08.930
The unsub leave these behind?

10:08.962 --> 10:10.331
Yeah, plastered everywhere

10:10.364 --> 10:11.865
up and down the street.

10:11.899 --> 10:13.934
Well, that's the father
that was abducted.

10:13.967 --> 10:15.836
Framed like a wanted poster.

10:15.870 --> 10:16.870
You think they're trying
to make some kind of

10:16.903 --> 10:18.338
statement about injustice?

10:18.371 --> 10:21.008
No. No, they're mocking us with this.

10:21.042 --> 10:22.877
That's Garcia's direct line.

10:22.909 --> 10:25.379
Thing is, even if this is a taunt,

10:25.413 --> 10:26.781
we still gotta follow the breadcrumbs.

10:26.813 --> 10:27.982
So, who's Susan?

10:34.956 --> 10:37.491
Dad, why is she doing this?

10:37.524 --> 10:39.461
What does she want?

10:39.494 --> 10:41.028
I don't know. It doesn't make any...

10:44.331 --> 10:45.734
Please.

10:45.767 --> 10:46.835
Let us go.

10:51.773 --> 10:53.007
You're making a mistake!

10:53.039 --> 10:54.007
No!

10:54.041 --> 10:55.410
We didn't do anything!

10:55.442 --> 10:57.745
Dad. No.

10:57.778 --> 11:00.014
We don't know who Susan is!

11:00.047 --> 11:01.149
No.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.149
No!

11:02.182 --> 11:03.317
Please.

11:03.351 --> 11:04.384
No, no.

11:04.418 --> 11:06.187
What... what are you doing?

11:06.220 --> 11:07.489
Dad, what is she doing?

11:07.522 --> 11:10.291
What are you doing? No! No! No!

11:10.323 --> 11:11.425
No, Dad,

11:11.458 --> 11:13.794
No! No, stop, stop!

11:15.229 --> 11:16.297
We I.D.'d the unsub.

11:16.330 --> 11:17.365
Her name is Juliette Weaver.

11:17.398 --> 11:19.500
It took the prison all of
5 minutes to identify her.

11:19.533 --> 11:21.101
She was Cat's old cellmate.

11:21.134 --> 11:22.870
Released from prison 6 months ago.

11:22.903 --> 11:23.904
Off the grid a week ago.

11:23.937 --> 11:24.739
What was she in for?

11:24.772 --> 11:26.141
Low-level possession. She took the rap

11:26.173 --> 11:29.209
for her boyfriend, but
according to the warden,

11:29.243 --> 11:31.012
she'd follow Cat
around like a puppy dog.

11:31.044 --> 11:33.347
Easily manipulated. So, Cat groomed her,

11:33.380 --> 11:34.481
got her to take orders.

11:34.514 --> 11:36.283
It goes deeper than that.

11:36.317 --> 11:38.385
Cat and Juliette have
something in common.

11:38.418 --> 11:39.920
Juliette's dad killed her mom

11:39.953 --> 11:41.255
in a domestic dispute.

11:41.288 --> 11:42.890
Then he fled and he was never caught.

11:42.923 --> 11:44.893
That's exactly what
happened with Cat's parents.

11:44.926 --> 11:46.995
Yeah, so, we did a
little digging into Susan.

11:47.028 --> 11:49.062
We thought that she
might've been Juliette's mom.

11:49.096 --> 11:50.063
But she's not.

11:50.096 --> 11:51.298
She's Cat's.

11:51.331 --> 11:52.933
Mm-hmm. Susan Adams.

11:52.966 --> 11:54.568
Unidentified cold case from 1987.

11:54.601 --> 11:56.170
She was found floating in the water

11:56.203 --> 11:57.271
on the Potomac.

11:57.304 --> 11:59.907
Thanks to that picture,
the case isn't cold anymore.

12:01.442 --> 12:03.144
Somehow you did it.

12:03.177 --> 12:05.547
You found what I couldn't.

12:05.580 --> 12:06.548
You found your father

12:06.581 --> 12:08.550
and you must have been furious

12:08.582 --> 12:11.084
when you discovered
that he started over.

12:11.118 --> 12:13.488
Had another daughter. And that

12:13.520 --> 12:16.591
is why you deviated from
your usual victimology.

12:16.624 --> 12:17.959
It wasn't enough to just hurt him.

12:17.991 --> 12:19.093
You had to hurt her, too.

12:20.628 --> 12:21.963
When are we going ice skating?

12:21.995 --> 12:23.063
We're not going ice skating.

12:23.096 --> 12:24.932
You know, we've been asking
ourselves this whole time

12:24.966 --> 12:26.033
what your hidden agenda was,

12:26.067 --> 12:28.068
but you tipped it

12:28.101 --> 12:31.072
when you said that you
were gonna win tonight.

12:31.105 --> 12:32.340
Even if I let you out of here,

12:32.373 --> 12:34.843
you'll still kill them.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.110
So, no ice skating?

12:36.143 --> 12:37.144
No ice skating.

12:40.981 --> 12:43.017
You should tell Garcia
to check her email.

12:47.187 --> 12:48.489
Ok, this just came in,

12:48.522 --> 12:50.959
exactly 12 hours after the last email.

12:50.991 --> 12:53.527
Completely untraceable
and it looks like a video.

12:53.561 --> 12:54.896
Here we go.

12:54.928 --> 12:56.898
No!

12:54.928 --> 12:56.898
No!

12:56.931 --> 13:00.902
No!

13:00.934 --> 13:03.103
Dad! Dad. Dad.

13:03.136 --> 13:04.638
Sweetie, I've got... I'm ok.

13:04.672 --> 13:07.041
- I'm ok.
- No. No!

13:07.073 --> 13:08.642
Blanks. She fired blanks.

13:08.676 --> 13:10.445
We have fewer than 12 hours left.

13:10.477 --> 13:12.379
I don't think she'll fire blanks again.

13:12.413 --> 13:14.182
If we give Cat what she wants,

13:14.215 --> 13:16.184
we can profile what
she says on the date.

13:16.216 --> 13:17.384
She always trips up.

13:17.418 --> 13:19.453
She always reveals her Achilles heel.

13:19.486 --> 13:21.589
And she always does it with you.

13:48.615 --> 13:51.485
Don't wait up.

14:03.292 --> 14:05.895
I can't believe this
is finally happening.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.931
Ha! What ice skating
rink are we going to?

14:10.665 --> 14:12.100
- Spencie.
- Don't call me that.

14:14.903 --> 14:16.973
God, your parents are so strict.

14:35.890 --> 14:37.592
This isn't what I wanted.

14:37.625 --> 14:38.660
It's the best I could do.

14:38.693 --> 14:40.062
It's not what I want.

14:40.095 --> 14:41.997
Skating is skating. What does it matter?

14:42.029 --> 14:44.132
It matters because
if I asked to hang out

14:44.165 --> 14:45.600
with a bunch of sixth graders,

14:45.634 --> 14:46.601
I would have asked to come here,

14:46.635 --> 14:47.736
but I didn't, did I?

14:47.769 --> 14:48.736
We put in the request, Cat,

14:48.770 --> 14:49.737
and the answer was no.

14:49.770 --> 14:50.872
- Why?
- Because we can't risk

14:50.905 --> 14:52.741
giving you access to a bladed tool.

14:52.774 --> 14:53.875
What, I'm gonna use an ice skate

14:53.909 --> 14:55.343
to slice your neck open? Grow up.

14:55.376 --> 14:56.945
Relax.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.082
It's out of my hands. It's
either this or nothing.

15:00.115 --> 15:01.116
Then nothing.

15:01.149 --> 15:02.116
- Fine.
- Fine.

15:02.149 --> 15:03.117
Get back in the van.

15:03.150 --> 15:04.852
I will.

15:04.885 --> 15:06.188
Had something special
planned for our anniversary

15:06.221 --> 15:07.856
but whatever, forget it.

15:07.889 --> 15:08.823
You remembered?

15:08.856 --> 15:10.592
Of course I remembered,
but this date is over,

15:10.625 --> 15:11.659
so, let's get back in the van.

15:11.693 --> 15:12.962
No, no, no, no. I want to see it.

15:14.630 --> 15:15.965
Come on. I want to see it.

15:15.997 --> 15:17.632
Give me something.

15:17.665 --> 15:19.000
No. Yes. Give me something

15:19.034 --> 15:20.602
to help find your dad and half-sister.

15:24.005 --> 15:25.140
23.

15:25.173 --> 15:26.609
That's nothing. Give
me something better.

15:26.641 --> 15:28.843
You're smart. You'll figure it out.

15:28.876 --> 15:30.178
Let's go. I want to see it.

15:30.212 --> 15:31.212
Let's go.

15:32.981 --> 15:35.217
Hold my hand. It's dark inside.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.019
You know we just had
our first fight, right?

15:41.756 --> 15:43.726
God, it smells so gross in here.

15:43.759 --> 15:45.094
That's why I hate roller rinks.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.260
Luke, can you hear me?

15:46.294 --> 15:47.362
Loud and clear.

15:47.395 --> 15:48.363
Light it up.

15:48.396 --> 15:49.765
Got it.

15:57.773 --> 15:59.141
Spencie...

16:02.744 --> 16:04.146
I'm a size 7 skate.

16:07.281 --> 16:10.852
23. Could be 23 chromosomes.

16:10.885 --> 16:12.353
That's how Cat found her father.

16:12.386 --> 16:13.354
Matt and I went through

16:13.388 --> 16:14.690
Cat's prison mail.

16:14.722 --> 16:16.958
Nothing says she ran
a familial DNA test.

16:16.991 --> 16:18.794
Unless she ran it through her lawyer,

16:18.827 --> 16:19.962
in which case it would be privileged

16:19.995 --> 16:20.962
and we wouldn't know about it.

16:20.995 --> 16:22.164
Where are we on Juliette Weaver?

16:22.197 --> 16:23.164
Dead end.

16:23.197 --> 16:24.232
We've looked into her and Cat's

16:24.265 --> 16:25.700
known locations in D.C.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.036
So, our best bet

16:27.068 --> 16:28.971
would be to get Cat to call Juliette

16:29.004 --> 16:30.372
or text her and maybe Garcia

16:30.404 --> 16:31.774
could trace the signal.

16:31.807 --> 16:33.008
There's no way we could force Cat

16:33.040 --> 16:34.175
to make that move.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.710
She'd see us coming a mile away.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.212
Find a way she won't.

16:37.245 --> 16:38.246
I'll get Cat's lawyer in here

16:38.279 --> 16:39.313
on that familial DNA test.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.783
It's not much but right now,

16:40.816 --> 16:41.917
it's all we've got.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.855
We've got a problem.

16:47.889 --> 16:48.856
I know.

16:48.890 --> 16:49.857
A big problem.

16:49.890 --> 16:51.226
I know we've only found

16:51.259 --> 16:52.461
what Cat wants us to find.

16:52.494 --> 16:54.997
The flyers. Juliette's identity.

16:55.029 --> 16:56.464
Pictures of the victims.

16:56.497 --> 16:58.833
She is not making this hard for us.

16:58.866 --> 17:00.202
From the very beginning, we profiled

17:00.234 --> 17:01.336
that there's a hidden agenda.

17:01.368 --> 17:02.737
This isn't hidden.

17:02.770 --> 17:04.940
Ok, so, that means Cat's got

17:04.972 --> 17:07.776
something bigger planned, but what?

17:07.808 --> 17:09.109
Last time, she pretended

17:09.144 --> 17:11.145
she was pregnant with Reid's baby.

17:11.179 --> 17:13.015
Before that, she planted a bomb

17:13.048 --> 17:13.915
under the restaurant.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.818
Both times, she got
us with our pants down.

17:15.849 --> 17:16.851
I'm telling you, the other shoe

17:16.885 --> 17:18.020
hasn't dropped yet.

17:18.051 --> 17:19.319
Ok, so, this doesn't have

17:19.354 --> 17:20.388
anything to do with her family,

17:20.422 --> 17:21.490
even though she wants us to think

17:21.521 --> 17:25.260
it does, so, what else could...

17:25.291 --> 17:26.294
What?

17:28.128 --> 17:30.131
Come on. I represent

17:30.164 --> 17:31.165
Catherine Adams.

17:31.199 --> 17:33.502
Attorney-client privilege means

17:33.535 --> 17:34.503
I can't talk to you guys.

17:34.536 --> 17:35.270
Unless you have

17:35.304 --> 17:37.072
knowledge of a crime your client is

17:37.105 --> 17:38.207
currently committing.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.375
Yeah, and I don't.

17:40.407 --> 17:41.510
She has a partner

17:41.542 --> 17:43.344
holding those two people hostage.

17:43.377 --> 17:45.313
We believe it's her
father and her half-sister.

17:45.346 --> 17:46.448
She could've only found them

17:46.481 --> 17:48.450
through a familial DNA search.

17:48.482 --> 17:51.087
She could've only made
that happen through you.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.991
Ok, yeah. She spit in a tube

17:56.023 --> 17:57.225
and sent it to me.

17:57.259 --> 17:58.260
I thought I was helping.

17:58.292 --> 17:59.427
How did she get the results?

17:59.461 --> 18:00.996
Did you send them to her in prison?

18:01.029 --> 18:03.065
No. There was another address.

18:03.097 --> 18:05.166
She wanted a friend to get them.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.135
Emily, we've got something.

18:14.509 --> 18:15.510
What's up?

18:17.244 --> 18:19.147
Can you skate backwards?

18:19.181 --> 18:21.150
I can barely skate forward.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.384
Really?

18:22.416 --> 18:24.385
Just look up.

18:24.418 --> 18:27.188
Not that far.

18:27.221 --> 18:28.891
Someone having fun?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.294
I'm having fun.

18:34.296 --> 18:35.898
If your stupid chaperone wasn't here,

18:35.931 --> 18:37.866
I would ask the DJ to put on some

18:37.898 --> 18:40.034
Savage Garden for the guy-girl skate

18:40.068 --> 18:42.538
and we could totally make out.

18:42.570 --> 18:44.839
You, uh... You realize

18:44.873 --> 18:46.275
what I have to do, right?

18:46.308 --> 18:49.010
Um, let me think.

18:49.043 --> 18:51.445
Ask me a bunch of pointed questions

18:51.479 --> 18:53.915
and hope that I trip up?

18:53.949 --> 18:55.284
Go ahead. Ask away.

18:55.317 --> 18:56.852
What happened to your baby?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.153
- What?
- The last time I saw you,

18:58.185 --> 18:59.520
you were pregnant with
someone else's baby

18:59.554 --> 19:01.190
that you said was mine.

19:01.222 --> 19:03.424
Why are you asking me about that?

19:03.458 --> 19:05.093
I don't want to talk about that.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.395
Hormonal changes during pregnancy

19:06.427 --> 19:08.095
expand the brain's capacity for empathy.

19:08.128 --> 19:09.096
I was actually just trying to

19:09.129 --> 19:10.298
see if I could use it against you.

19:10.331 --> 19:13.434
Oh, really? What about, um, sex?

19:17.204 --> 19:18.439
Why don't you use that against me?

19:31.418 --> 19:33.020
Got the shot.

19:33.054 --> 19:34.056
Hold. Hold.

19:34.088 --> 19:37.158
Cat, wait. Cat. Cat.

19:37.192 --> 19:38.227
Wait.

19:41.363 --> 19:43.398
I can explain.

19:43.431 --> 19:46.300
I have spent my entire
adult life reading men.

19:46.334 --> 19:48.202
I know when they're
thinking about someone else.

19:48.235 --> 19:49.403
Yes, I'm dating someone,
but that doesn't mean...

19:49.436 --> 19:51.939
Do you know what this was for me?

19:51.972 --> 19:54.209
I didn't ask for one last family visit.

19:54.241 --> 19:57.011
I didn't want one final meal.

19:57.045 --> 19:58.447
I wanted this.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.214
And you can't even give me the courtesy

20:00.248 --> 20:03.285
of your undivided attention
before I'm executed.

20:03.318 --> 20:07.356
So, thank you very much, but

20:07.388 --> 20:09.023
this date is over.

20:09.057 --> 20:11.460
You can turn off the
stupid lights, boys.

20:11.492 --> 20:12.493
Let's get out of here.

20:13.627 --> 20:14.929
She's not you.

20:17.665 --> 20:19.233
You're lying.

20:19.267 --> 20:20.669
I'm not lying. I wish
I was, but I'm not.

20:20.702 --> 20:24.205
There's some part of my brain, some...

20:24.239 --> 20:26.540
Some part that you somehow inhabit

20:26.574 --> 20:28.210
and no woman, no matter how good,

20:28.242 --> 20:31.346
no matter how kind, no matter how...

20:31.378 --> 20:34.649
Sexy she is can ever get you out.

20:41.690 --> 20:44.558
Do you think about me when you kiss her?

20:44.591 --> 20:45.927
I don't know. I haven't kissed her.

20:48.296 --> 20:49.564
You haven't kissed her yet?

20:49.596 --> 20:50.933
You haven't kissed me yet.

20:53.033 --> 20:54.068
So, what have you done with her

20:54.102 --> 20:55.237
that you haven't done with me?

20:56.437 --> 20:58.039
Come on. Give me something.

20:58.073 --> 20:59.474
She saw my apartment.

20:59.507 --> 21:02.378
Then I want to see your apartment. Now.

21:05.279 --> 21:06.447
FBI.

21:10.318 --> 21:12.320
What's your name?

21:12.354 --> 21:14.623
Don. Don Brenner.

21:14.655 --> 21:16.325
She took my daughter!
I don't know where!

21:16.357 --> 21:18.059
Ok, Don, I need you to listen to me.

21:18.093 --> 21:21.196
Um... The kidnapper, Juliette Weaver,

21:21.229 --> 21:22.463
she's working very closely

21:22.497 --> 21:23.731
with Catherine Adams.

21:23.764 --> 21:25.666
Have you had any contact with her?

21:25.700 --> 21:27.369
- Who?
- Catherine Adams.

21:27.402 --> 21:29.237
Your... your daughter.

21:29.270 --> 21:30.506
I-I don't know who that is.

21:32.473 --> 21:34.308
No, you don't. Do you?

21:34.341 --> 21:35.376
JJ.

21:37.412 --> 21:38.346
You got a knife.

21:38.379 --> 21:39.614
Results from the DNA search.

21:42.216 --> 21:44.707
"We've matched your submitted DNA"

21:44.707 --> 21:46.515
"to an unidentified male in Vancouver,

21:46.515 --> 21:49.290
deceased as of December 2016."

21:49.324 --> 21:51.360
Cat's dad was dead all along.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.095
She and Juliette knew that.

21:53.127 --> 21:55.798
Their whole agenda was
just to throw us off track,

21:55.798 --> 21:56.731
waste our time.

21:56.764 --> 21:57.966
Why?

21:59.500 --> 22:00.501
Spencer.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.706
You sure you want to do this, man?

22:04.739 --> 22:05.539
Whatever it takes.

22:08.443 --> 22:12.010
Hey. Did you really mean what you said?

22:14.402 --> 22:15.636
Yes.

22:15.670 --> 22:18.038
Prove it.

22:18.072 --> 22:19.574
And make it good.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.475
Because I'm this close
to letting them die.

22:47.811 --> 22:49.045
What are you doing here?

22:49.079 --> 22:50.614
Get her out of here.
Get her out of here.

22:50.647 --> 22:52.148
No, no, no. She will
kill them if I leave.

22:52.181 --> 22:53.149
Kill who?

22:53.183 --> 22:54.518
My father and my sister.

22:54.551 --> 22:55.519
Michelle?

22:55.552 --> 22:57.888
No, my... my younger sister.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.489
Look, I got a call from some woman.

22:59.523 --> 23:00.523
I heard my sister

23:00.556 --> 23:01.557
screaming in the background.

23:01.591 --> 23:02.758
She told me to come here,

23:02.792 --> 23:03.961
that there would be a key under the mat.

23:03.994 --> 23:05.928
Spencer, what is happening?

23:05.962 --> 23:07.764
It's your family she kidnapped.

23:07.796 --> 23:08.998
JJ and Matt recovered your dad.

23:09.032 --> 23:10.000
He's alive and unharmed.

23:10.033 --> 23:11.001
What about Eloise?

23:11.033 --> 23:12.503
She's still missing.

23:12.535 --> 23:14.036
I say we get Cat, we
put her in her cell,

23:14.070 --> 23:15.038
and we regroup.

23:15.071 --> 23:16.740
No. Bring her in here

23:16.773 --> 23:17.908
and leave us alone.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.709
Dude.

23:21.610 --> 23:22.812
You can monitor us with this.

23:24.747 --> 23:26.883
Follow my lead. We can outsmart her.

23:26.917 --> 23:28.185
Let her gloat. She loves to gloat.

23:28.217 --> 23:30.786
Just don't show fear or
she'll use it against you.

23:30.820 --> 23:31.856
Who?

23:34.157 --> 23:35.192
Her.

23:42.966 --> 23:44.834
We're all here. What do
you want to talk about?

23:44.868 --> 23:47.171
So, so much.

23:49.139 --> 23:50.139
She's cute.

23:55.678 --> 23:57.046
Juliette staked out Reid's life,

23:57.080 --> 23:58.715
found out he was dating somebody new.

23:58.747 --> 23:59.917
He was probably so focused on Max

23:59.949 --> 24:01.784
every time they went out
that he never noticed.

24:01.818 --> 24:03.186
But if Juliette was able
to find Max's family,

24:03.218 --> 24:04.720
it means she must have access

24:04.754 --> 24:06.822
to all of her publicly
available information.

24:06.856 --> 24:07.991
At least we found their hidden agenda.

24:08.023 --> 24:10.159
No, we found Cat's hidden agenda.

24:10.193 --> 24:12.129
Juliette doesn't care about Reid.

24:12.161 --> 24:13.764
There's something we're missing here.

24:13.796 --> 24:15.331
- Do a deep dive with Garcia.
- On it.

24:15.364 --> 24:16.332
I'll go to Reid's apartment

24:16.366 --> 24:17.234
and monitor on site.

24:17.266 --> 24:19.001
Is there a trap-and-trace
on his landline?

24:19.034 --> 24:20.137
Garcia's almost set up.

24:20.169 --> 24:21.304
Ok.

24:21.338 --> 24:22.706
Well, this went from bad to worse.

24:22.738 --> 24:23.973
- Yeah.
- Female narcissists

24:24.006 --> 24:25.676
destroy their competition.

24:25.708 --> 24:27.177
Maxine Brenner shouldn't
even be in there.

24:27.209 --> 24:28.177
We're putting her life at risk.

24:28.210 --> 24:29.779
- Walk with me.
- Yeah.

24:29.812 --> 24:32.081
Great. Ok. Thank you, doctor.

24:32.114 --> 24:33.149
So, the hospital just released

24:33.183 --> 24:34.251
the dad... Don Brenner.

24:34.283 --> 24:36.052
He's on his way here now.

24:36.085 --> 24:38.020
Question is, why let him go at all?

24:38.053 --> 24:40.056
Matt's on that. Juliette
Weaver's real agenda

24:40.090 --> 24:41.191
should tell us where she's taking

24:41.224 --> 24:42.326
Max's younger sister.

24:42.359 --> 24:43.360
I still think the play here

24:43.392 --> 24:44.360
is to get Cat and Juliette

24:44.393 --> 24:46.162
to contact each other, but

24:46.196 --> 24:47.164
I have no idea how.

24:47.197 --> 24:48.732
I have a plan,

24:48.764 --> 24:50.301
but first we have to talk about Max.

24:55.237 --> 24:56.305
Did it make you mad that I was

24:56.339 --> 24:58.241
kissing your boyfriend?

24:58.273 --> 25:00.177
No.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.711
Why not?

25:01.745 --> 25:03.847
Well, he's not my boyfriend

25:03.879 --> 25:05.114
and I kind of have

25:05.148 --> 25:07.149
some other things on my mind.

25:07.183 --> 25:08.218
Like what?

25:08.251 --> 25:09.653
Are you gonna hurt Eloise?

25:09.686 --> 25:11.621
Not if I don't have to, no.

25:11.655 --> 25:13.991
Honestly, if she follows instructions,

25:14.023 --> 25:16.927
she might even learn from
this whole experience.

25:16.959 --> 25:17.927
What does that mean?

25:17.960 --> 25:18.961
What does that mean?

25:18.995 --> 25:20.129
Max's sister won't learn from Cat.

25:20.162 --> 25:22.131
That means she'll learn from Juliette.

25:22.165 --> 25:23.133
Bring up her record.

25:24.367 --> 25:25.335
She went to prison

25:25.368 --> 25:27.236
when she was 20.

25:27.270 --> 25:29.706
That's the same age as Eloise now.

25:29.738 --> 25:31.774
She could be grooming her,

25:31.808 --> 25:34.011
the same way that Cat groomed Juliette.

25:34.043 --> 25:35.277
Ok, grooming her for what?

25:35.311 --> 25:37.482
Well, it's not about punishing
Dad. She let Max's dad go.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.429
It could be about the
boyfriend she took the rap for.

25:41.775 --> 25:42.743
What's that guy's story?

25:42.776 --> 25:44.475
Let's find out, shall we?

25:45.443 --> 25:47.446
Where are we going?

25:47.480 --> 25:48.681
We're gonna see the man who told me

25:48.713 --> 25:51.683
to go to prison for him.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.319
We're gonna kill him.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.320
You don't need me for that.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.587
You could do it yourself.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.757
I'll stay in the car. I'll
do whatever you want...

25:57.789 --> 26:01.326
I'm teaching you.

26:01.359 --> 26:04.329
Just like Cat taught me.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.666
All men are like him.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.769
No. They're not.

26:09.801 --> 26:14.673
Ohh. I guess it runs in the family, huh?

26:14.707 --> 26:16.175
What?

26:16.208 --> 26:18.211
Naivete.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.779
Your sister's learning that same lesson.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.782
Normally, Spencie and I,

26:22.815 --> 26:24.784
we spend our time together

26:24.817 --> 26:28.086
playing games, but

26:28.120 --> 26:31.224
tonight, I've brought you all here

26:31.257 --> 26:32.759
to make a point.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.659
You can do so much better.

26:34.692 --> 26:35.661
With you?

26:35.693 --> 26:37.763
I'm not talking to you.

26:37.797 --> 26:38.999
I'm talking to you.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.667
Because, girlfriend,

26:42.701 --> 26:44.537
you need to know the
truth about your boyfriend.

26:44.569 --> 26:46.172
He's not my boyfriend.

26:46.204 --> 26:47.306
No kidding. You guys

26:47.338 --> 26:48.508
haven't even made out yet.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.509
You told her that?

26:50.542 --> 26:52.177
I had to say a lot of things tonight.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.247
Yes, he has. He said

26:54.279 --> 26:56.115
that you're not me,

26:56.147 --> 26:58.583
that, um... That no matter what,

26:58.616 --> 27:00.752
he can't get me out of his mind.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.788
Everything I said I was lying

27:01.820 --> 27:03.722
to save your family.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.091
Did our kiss look like a lie?

27:06.659 --> 27:08.461
No.

27:08.493 --> 27:10.495
Thank you. See, now we're getting

27:10.528 --> 27:12.498
to the heart of the matter.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.500
You see,

27:15.534 --> 27:17.603
everyone thinks that

27:17.635 --> 27:19.538
Dr. Spencer Reid is...

27:19.572 --> 27:23.643
Is just this nice, bookish, uh, genius

27:23.675 --> 27:26.078
who, uh, always saves the day

27:26.112 --> 27:28.081
and has all the answers.

27:28.114 --> 27:32.719
And has zero mommy issues, right?

27:34.854 --> 27:38.290
But, um... I know the real him.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.093
Oh, yeah? Who's the real me, Cat?

27:40.125 --> 27:41.626
The real Spencer Reid

27:41.660 --> 27:43.463
throws women against walls...

27:48.901 --> 27:52.705
And hisses that he's going to kill them.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.474
I'm going to kill you.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.708
- Stop it!
- I'm gonna kill you.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.480
That was a very different situation.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.513
No, it wasn't.

28:01.547 --> 28:02.649
What is she talking about?

28:05.784 --> 28:06.752
You tell her. She's not gonna

28:06.785 --> 28:08.220
believe it coming from me.

28:09.555 --> 28:10.823
How fluid is the situation?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.459
Don't think fluid. Think flammable.

28:13.491 --> 28:14.826
Two years ago, Cat had

28:14.859 --> 28:16.628
her partner kidnap my mother.

28:16.662 --> 28:19.531
Just like tonight. She
got under my skin and...

28:19.565 --> 28:22.335
And you threw her against a wall.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.870
Don't skimp on the details, Spencie.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.638
She deserves to know everything.

28:28.406 --> 28:29.841
She was pregnant at the time

28:29.874 --> 28:33.179
and I knew that when I hurt her.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.247
And?

28:35.814 --> 28:37.550
The next day...

28:39.652 --> 28:40.653
I miscarried.

28:44.656 --> 28:45.724
The end.

28:45.758 --> 28:46.759
That's not true.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.293
It is most certainly true.

28:48.326 --> 28:49.862
Check my medical records.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.263
That doesn't mean I-I would...

28:51.297 --> 28:52.297
Stop.

28:53.932 --> 28:55.134
Look.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.939
I thought you were decent.

28:59.971 --> 29:00.940
Pull the plug. Come on.

29:00.972 --> 29:05.177
No. Not yet. Rossi, where are you?

29:05.211 --> 29:06.511
We're almost at the
boyfriend's apartment.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.647
We'll stake it out and set up roadblocks

29:07.680 --> 29:08.948
in a mile radius.

29:08.980 --> 29:09.949
If Juliet smells a trap,

29:09.981 --> 29:11.183
she'll kill Eloise.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.185
We need to get the drop on her

29:12.218 --> 29:13.352
so she doesn't see us coming.

29:13.384 --> 29:14.519
Reid knows what we need.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.389
If he can get Cat to call Juliet,

29:16.422 --> 29:17.523
we can pinpoint her location

29:17.556 --> 29:18.557
and do exactly that.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.161
I'm sorry.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.499
Notice how your boyfriend

29:27.532 --> 29:30.235
is apologizing to you and not me.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.703
- He's not my boyfriend.
- I'm not her boyfriend.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.406
That's good.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.641
Because men are all the same.

29:35.673 --> 29:36.642
Aren't they, Maxie?

29:36.674 --> 29:37.576
Don't call her that.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.910
What, are you gonna
throw me against a wall

29:38.943 --> 29:40.245
and choke me, or do you

29:40.278 --> 29:41.446
only do that to pregnant women?

29:41.480 --> 29:42.815
Why are you doing this?

29:42.847 --> 29:44.783
Because I want you to see it.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.653
I want you to see that he is...

29:47.685 --> 29:50.455
No better than whoever hurt you before.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.457
Stop.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.925
I can see it on your face.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.228
What's his name?

29:55.260 --> 29:56.796
It's none of your business.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.597
It is exactly my business.

30:00.365 --> 30:01.834
In fact, it's my specialty.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.239
I mean, I could have
Juliette and baby sister

30:06.271 --> 30:08.840
go over there if you want.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.309
They could take care of him.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.778
Say yes.

30:12.810 --> 30:14.413
Give her what she wants.

30:14.445 --> 30:15.814
Hmm.

30:15.847 --> 30:17.883
See, he wants you to get me

30:17.915 --> 30:20.552
to make a little phone call

30:20.586 --> 30:21.753
so they can trace it.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.824
They're so good, the FBI.

30:28.559 --> 30:30.663
What is wrong with the two of you?

30:30.695 --> 30:33.832
What is this sick, twisted
thing that you have?

30:33.865 --> 30:35.533
Listen, I just want to save my sister.

30:35.567 --> 30:36.836
Will you please just tell me

30:36.868 --> 30:39.738
what I have to do to do that?

30:39.771 --> 30:40.772
Tell me his name.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.344
Tell me the story. That's it.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.845
And then if they can let Juliette

30:46.878 --> 30:49.481
exit stage right,

30:49.515 --> 30:51.417
then I promise you I will let her go.

31:06.565 --> 31:07.567
What is she doing?

31:09.934 --> 31:11.936
Here. Use this use my phone.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.506
They can't trace it.

31:13.538 --> 31:14.906
You'd be surprised.

31:14.940 --> 31:15.908
I don't even need a call.

31:15.941 --> 31:17.710
Just... just a photo.

31:17.742 --> 31:18.844
Something to prove to me that she's

31:18.876 --> 31:20.812
still alive. Please.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.714
Story first.

31:22.748 --> 31:23.716
Max, Max,

31:23.749 --> 31:25.518
I have been here with her before.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.385
She called the number
and told the partner

31:27.419 --> 31:28.387
to kill my mom.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.788
It is so tricky, isn't it?

31:29.822 --> 31:31.757
I mean, who are you gonna trust?

31:31.789 --> 31:34.693
The lying, cheating,
violent psychopath...

31:36.362 --> 31:37.497
Or me?

31:45.938 --> 31:47.073
His name was Mike Davis.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.607
We dated for two years.

31:51.442 --> 31:53.812
Good. When did it end?

31:53.845 --> 31:55.480
Last year.

31:55.513 --> 31:56.615
Was he good in bed?

31:56.647 --> 31:57.782
Shut up.

31:57.816 --> 32:00.019
What? You have to know where you stand.

32:00.051 --> 32:03.388
He was good...

32:03.422 --> 32:06.491
Good at, um, separating me

32:06.525 --> 32:08.994
from my friends and my family.

32:09.027 --> 32:10.930
Enough that the first time
he punched me in the face,

32:10.962 --> 32:13.665
I didn't have anywhere to go.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.902
And my first response wasn't "get out."

32:16.934 --> 32:19.105
It wasn't "go to hell."
It was "I'm sorry, Mike."

32:21.839 --> 32:22.841
That's when he knew he had me.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.747
How many hospital visits were there?

32:29.013 --> 32:31.082
None.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.818
No, he...

32:33.852 --> 32:36.022
He knew how to hurt me
just enough, I guess.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.492
But you found the strength to leave.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.627
What did you do?

32:45.730 --> 32:49.067
I planned and I... I waited.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.103
Waited for what?

32:51.870 --> 32:53.038
I live here in D.C. but I'm also

32:53.070 --> 32:54.740
a resident in Virginia.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.744
It takes 60 days for
the permit to clear.

33:00.578 --> 33:01.980
Max, stop talking.

33:02.013 --> 33:02.981
Stop talking right now.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.984
No, don't stop. Here.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.818
Give me the phone.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.921
Look, I'm gonna enter the text.

33:08.953 --> 33:10.722
Stick the landing and I'll hit "send."

33:13.826 --> 33:16.162
When I was ready, I picked a fight.

33:16.194 --> 33:18.830
Loud enough for the neighbors to hear.

33:18.864 --> 33:21.567
And he came at me with
his fist just cocked back,

33:21.599 --> 33:22.767
so, I pulled my Glock 19

33:22.800 --> 33:23.869
out of my purse.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.640
I shot him.

33:31.042 --> 33:34.078
It was self-defense.
He was attacking you.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.547
That's what I told 911

33:35.580 --> 33:36.682
as he was struggling to breathe

33:36.714 --> 33:37.817
on his kitchen floor.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.117
That's why the police never charged me.

33:39.151 --> 33:42.087
But I... after I hung up, I...

33:45.524 --> 33:46.993
I shot him two more times.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.165
Wow, you really have a type, don't you?

33:55.133 --> 33:57.536
Quite a dilemma, too.

33:57.568 --> 33:59.171
She just admitted to murder.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.638
She'll beat it.

34:00.671 --> 34:02.974
Probably.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.143
But you two are done.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.614
Oh, wow.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.815
Look at that. Your sister.

34:10.848 --> 34:12.817
Alive and well.

34:12.850 --> 34:13.851
Well, you're welcome.

34:16.087 --> 34:17.790
I-I got something. I got something,

34:17.822 --> 34:18.824
please, please, please help.

34:26.697 --> 34:27.799
I win.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.213
Do you know why I did this?

34:43.981 --> 34:45.518
Why I really did this?

34:46.684 --> 34:48.518
You wanted to prove I'm a monster

34:48.552 --> 34:49.554
just like you.

34:52.523 --> 34:55.393
No... Silly.

35:00.565 --> 35:02.300
I just wanted to see you again.

35:05.936 --> 35:07.505
I just wanted to make sure that

35:07.539 --> 35:12.678
you would never forget about me.

35:12.710 --> 35:15.913
'Cause when they do put
that needle in my arm, I just

35:15.947 --> 35:19.452
want there to be even the
slightest chance that...

35:22.420 --> 35:23.989
Maybe you're still thinking about me.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.863
You didn't have to
terrorize 3 innocent people.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.431
You could've just written a letter.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.001
Would you have written me back?

35:54.652 --> 35:55.721
Bye, Spencie.

35:57.054 --> 35:58.490
I really enjoyed our date.

36:15.873 --> 36:17.475
We need to debrief.

36:25.416 --> 36:26.485
Hey.

36:27.885 --> 36:29.887
So, we have a lot to talk about.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.589
Yeah.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.925
I know, right?

36:33.958 --> 36:35.793
What is this? How...

36:35.827 --> 36:37.663
We had to think fast.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.065
But we, we pulled it off.

36:40.097 --> 36:41.467
Pulled what off?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.402
- Outsmarting Cat.
- How?

36:43.434 --> 36:44.603
Basically, kid, we had to

36:44.635 --> 36:46.371
keep you in the dark.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.506
And if you knew what we knew,

36:47.539 --> 36:50.409
we were afraid that Cat would know, too.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.543
When did all this start?

36:51.576 --> 36:53.112
It started when your date started.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.148
Both times she had us
with our pants down.

36:57.181 --> 36:59.417
I'm telling you, the other
shoe hasn't dropped yet.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.686
Ok, so, this doesn't have

37:00.719 --> 37:01.619
anything to do with her family,

37:01.653 --> 37:03.822
even though she wants
us to think it does.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.157
So, what else could...

37:06.190 --> 37:07.558
What?

37:07.592 --> 37:09.461
JJ said Spencer started
dating someone new,

37:09.494 --> 37:10.896
and it's a coincidence that Cat Adams

37:10.929 --> 37:12.597
decided to act now?

37:12.630 --> 37:14.866
We've put the pieces together
that Cat was doing this

37:14.900 --> 37:16.168
because of Max.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.603
And by the time we identified her,

37:17.635 --> 37:19.404
JJ and I had just found Don.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.472
Just in time, too.

37:20.505 --> 37:21.940
Max had gotten the message

37:21.972 --> 37:23.641
that her sister was in trouble.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.443
That order to go to your apartment,

37:25.476 --> 37:26.577
the key under the mat?

37:26.610 --> 37:27.578
That part was real.

37:27.612 --> 37:31.950
Once they found me...
I was a little upset.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.924
No. No, no, no, no, no, please.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.193
You've got to move your cars.

37:41.226 --> 37:42.760
It's an emergency.

37:42.793 --> 37:44.695
Max?

37:44.728 --> 37:45.764
Dad?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.601
Sweetie. You're all right.

37:49.634 --> 37:50.601
You're ok.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.204
So, I rode with them to brief Max.

37:52.237 --> 37:53.806
She was a really quick study.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.840
She did what to him in Mexico?

37:55.873 --> 37:56.841
Yeah, and that's where the story

37:56.875 --> 37:58.110
gets even more convoluted.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.677
All you need to know is

37:59.710 --> 38:01.112
her whole reason for doing this

38:01.146 --> 38:02.581
is to destroy Reid's life.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.682
And you're just the next

38:03.715 --> 38:05.684
pawn in her game.

38:05.717 --> 38:08.519
Ok, so, she's, like, a mean girl,

38:08.552 --> 38:09.987
but more stabby.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.089
Yes.

38:11.121 --> 38:12.190
You said that?

38:12.224 --> 38:13.992
I didn't put it exactly that way.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.595
No, that's exactly
what you said verbatim.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.696
Or it's how I remember it. Anyway,

38:17.728 --> 38:18.529
that doesn't matter.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.065
The point is, we got to your apartment

38:20.097 --> 38:22.134
moments before you and Alvez arrived.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.235
We'll be able to monitor you

38:23.268 --> 38:24.702
with this the whole time.

38:24.735 --> 38:25.938
We'll all be listening, but

38:25.971 --> 38:27.773
Prentiss will be
telling you what to say.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.974
Thumbs up if you can hear me.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.576
And we were in communication

38:31.610 --> 38:32.811
with her the whole time,

38:32.844 --> 38:34.579
so, we could feed her
what she needed to say.

38:34.612 --> 38:35.880
She's not trained for this.

38:35.914 --> 38:36.949
Yeah.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.083
I was concerned about that.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.586
We needed a strategy.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.854
Look, our best bet is still

38:41.887 --> 38:42.855
to get Cat and Juliette

38:42.887 --> 38:44.590
to contact each other, but

38:44.623 --> 38:45.958
I can't figure out how.

38:45.990 --> 38:46.992
I've got a plan, but first,

38:47.025 --> 38:48.559
we have to talk about Max.

38:48.592 --> 38:51.096
Look, she's smart and tough, but

38:51.128 --> 38:53.065
we all know that Cat
will see right through her

38:53.097 --> 38:54.565
if she says the wrong thing.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.268
Abusive men. This all comes back

38:56.300 --> 38:57.802
to abusive men.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.170
We'd be out of work if it didn't.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.240
But what if Max plays into that?

39:01.273 --> 39:03.008
This was the tricky part.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.977
We had to ask Max to improvise.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.245
How fluid is the situation?

39:06.277 --> 39:08.546
Don't think fluid. Think flammable.

39:08.579 --> 39:09.947
Max, listen closely. We are gonna

39:09.981 --> 39:11.717
need you to lie.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.751
I miscarried.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.554
The end.

39:15.586 --> 39:16.688
It's not true.

39:16.721 --> 39:18.155
Fake tears.

39:18.188 --> 39:20.791
If you can't fake tears, fake anger.

39:20.824 --> 39:21.826
Look.

39:24.262 --> 39:25.964
Guessing you didn't
have to work that hard.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.965
Right now, I'm disgusted with myself.

39:27.998 --> 39:30.167
Hey, let me help you with that part.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.702
Cat said check the medical record

39:31.735 --> 39:32.971
and I did.

39:33.003 --> 39:33.971
She had a miscarriage

39:34.005 --> 39:34.972
but it was months later.

39:35.005 --> 39:35.973
It had nothing to do with you.

39:36.007 --> 39:36.942
That was another lie she said

39:36.974 --> 39:38.911
to make you feel terrible
and throw you, so,

39:38.943 --> 39:40.846
I told Max and the rest

39:40.878 --> 39:42.681
of our furry friends this information.

39:42.713 --> 39:43.882
What we didn't expect was

39:43.914 --> 39:45.182
what Max did next.

39:45.215 --> 39:48.185
I'm no profiler, but I know queen bees.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.255
If she was willing to
tell that kind of a lie,

39:50.288 --> 39:52.257
I knew who I was dealing with.

39:52.289 --> 39:54.226
So, Prentiss told you
what you needed to say?

39:54.259 --> 39:56.260
Not quite.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.695
That's what I told 911 when he was

39:57.728 --> 40:00.031
struggling to breathe
on his kitchen floor.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.000
That's why the police didn't charge me.

40:02.032 --> 40:04.268
But after I hung up, I
shot him two more times.

40:04.302 --> 40:05.604
Jeez.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.706
Yeah. Don't mess with Max.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.273
So, Mike Davis is...

40:09.306 --> 40:10.841
Alive and well.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.244
Living in jersey. Married, I think.

40:13.277 --> 40:15.913
He's a douchebag but not an abusive one.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.182
How'd you know that would work?

40:17.215 --> 40:17.916
She sees the world one way,

40:17.949 --> 40:19.251
that everyone's out to hurt you.

40:19.284 --> 40:21.720
So, I just kind of played on that.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.988
And it all worked out.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.356
Cat sent the text

40:24.389 --> 40:26.358
and because we were already in the area,

40:26.391 --> 40:29.860
we were on top of her
before she knew it.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.834
Now what?

40:35.867 --> 40:37.736
It's your lucky day.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.871
Now you get out.

40:50.949 --> 40:51.983
FBI!

40:53.284 --> 40:55.052
Hands where I can see them.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.721
It's ok, Eloise. You're safe.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.160
It is very nice to meet you, Eloise.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.930
Thanks for saving my life.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.064
All of you. I don't know

41:06.097 --> 41:07.332
what we would have done if it wasn't

41:07.364 --> 41:08.766
for this whole team.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.669
So,

41:10.702 --> 41:12.037
you're dating my daughter.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.672
Spencer Reid, sir. Not quite the way

41:13.704 --> 41:14.873
I was expecting we'd meet.

41:14.905 --> 41:16.641
Well, Mike Davis aside,

41:16.675 --> 41:18.644
Max is pretty good at
picking a boyfriend.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.211
He's not her boyfriend.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.061
So, that kiss, though.

41:37.094 --> 41:38.929
Yeah, that.

41:38.963 --> 41:39.965
She's right. You know, you can't

41:39.998 --> 41:41.066
fake that kind of thing.

41:41.099 --> 41:43.235
No, you can't, but

41:43.268 --> 41:46.704
I've heard that with the right person,

41:46.737 --> 41:49.774
you can do even better.

41:49.807 --> 41:51.943
You just like the bad girls.

41:51.976 --> 41:54.880
Truthfully? Sometimes.

41:54.913 --> 41:59.418
But right now, I like
the good girl better.

42:02.219 --> 42:03.788
Is your life always this exciting?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.323
No. Well, my personal life isn't.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.960
Thank god,

42:08.992 --> 42:11.962
because this was probably

42:11.996 --> 42:14.066
the worst third date ever.

42:14.099 --> 42:17.001
Is there anything I
can do to salvage it?

42:19.403 --> 42:20.838
There may be one thing.
