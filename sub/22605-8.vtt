00:29.812 --> 00:31.540
He's in a meeting, Madam Secretary.

00:31.541 --> 00:32.758
If you could just wait...

00:32.759 --> 00:34.003
I'll let him know you're here.

00:34.004 --> 00:35.171
We need to talk.

00:35.172 --> 00:36.139
In private.

00:36.140 --> 00:38.107
Now!

00:38.108 --> 00:40.375
All right, we'll pick this up later.

00:43.112 --> 00:44.814
What the hell are you doing?

00:44.815 --> 00:47.517
My sentiments exactly.

00:47.518 --> 00:49.118
The NSA reactivated Henry.

00:49.119 --> 00:50.286
That's hardly my concern.

00:50.287 --> 00:51.521
I know that you know.

00:51.522 --> 00:53.790
The directive came from this office.

00:53.791 --> 00:56.726
Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't
be bringing this to you.

00:56.727 --> 00:57.927
I'm the Secretary of State.

00:57.928 --> 01:00.029
How long did you think you
could keep this from me?

01:00.030 --> 01:01.030
You didn't need to know.

01:01.031 --> 01:02.265
Says who?

01:02.266 --> 01:03.332
The president.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.066
POTUS signed off on this?

01:05.068 --> 01:07.203
Henry said you'd be okay with this.

01:07.204 --> 01:09.372
My husband is a public figure.

01:09.373 --> 01:12.308
Yes, I heard about the
Arm Candy Top Ten list.

01:12.309 --> 01:13.676
It's impressive.

01:13.677 --> 01:15.077
I'm sorry they slighted you, Russell.

01:15.078 --> 01:16.078
But here's the problem.

01:16.079 --> 01:17.747
If it leaks...

01:17.748 --> 01:20.483
there isn't a diplomat in
the world who will trust me.

01:20.484 --> 01:22.885
I raised the same point
with the president.

01:22.886 --> 01:24.253
- And?
- What do you want me to say?

01:24.254 --> 01:26.688
He decided it was worth the risk.

01:27.490 --> 01:29.692
If it's any consolation,

01:29.693 --> 01:31.294
we're expecting it
to be a short-term op.

01:31.295 --> 01:34.729
Just... one and done.

01:35.698 --> 01:37.567
If I'm not mistaken, you have

01:37.568 --> 01:41.404
an appointment with the, uh,
Prime Minister of Macedonia?

01:41.405 --> 01:43.772
Moldova.

01:44.774 --> 01:46.775
This isn't finished.

01:48.177 --> 01:51.179
(classical music playing
under indistinct conversation)

01:54.150 --> 01:56.586
Klaus?

01:56.587 --> 01:58.754
Is that you?

01:58.755 --> 02:00.156
McCord.

02:00.157 --> 02:02.124
It's been far too long.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.894
It has. What, it's been...
what, since, uh, Jerusalem.

02:04.895 --> 02:08.064
Yes, I was literally on
the road to Damascus,

02:08.065 --> 02:10.499
and you, uh, presented
a very fine paper

02:10.500 --> 02:11.968
on the Council of Lyon.

02:11.969 --> 02:13.369
Oh, you're too kind. Thank you.

02:13.370 --> 02:14.971
I heard you took an appointment at GW.

02:14.972 --> 02:16.105
Yes.

02:16.106 --> 02:17.707
I heard that your wife

02:17.708 --> 02:19.876
took an appointment
as Secretary of State.

02:19.877 --> 02:20.977
Yes, she did.

02:20.978 --> 02:22.411
It's a big change.

02:22.412 --> 02:23.713
I'm sure she's thriving.

02:23.714 --> 02:24.947
Mm-hmm.

02:24.948 --> 02:26.849
You know what I remember

02:26.850 --> 02:29.051
is that chess set that you bought

02:29.052 --> 02:31.721
in Jerusalem in the souk in the old city?

02:31.722 --> 02:33.256
Yes, the-the-the Nishapur set.

02:33.257 --> 02:35.925
Yes! It was so beautiful.

02:35.926 --> 02:36.964
Tell me something.

02:36.965 --> 02:38.761
Do you still have my first edition copy

02:38.762 --> 02:40.696
of <i>The Book on Adler?</i>

02:40.697 --> 02:42.365
Uh... I'm not sure.

02:42.366 --> 02:43.466
Uh, well, listen...

02:43.467 --> 02:44.467
if you can't find it,

02:44.468 --> 02:46.335
you at least owe me a game of chess.

02:46.336 --> 02:48.838
- (laughs)
- Care for an appetizer?

02:48.839 --> 02:49.872
Okay.

02:49.873 --> 02:51.140
Frankly, I'm surprised to see you

02:51.141 --> 02:53.576
at an-an archaeology event.

02:53.577 --> 02:54.977
I thought you were much more at home

02:54.978 --> 02:56.479
in the realm of, uh, pure theology.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.414
It's for a book I'm
writing on St. Francis.

02:58.415 --> 03:00.482
It's, uh, giving me a deeper context.

03:01.517 --> 03:03.085
If you'll excuse me, Henry,

03:03.086 --> 03:05.621
but I have to speak with the dean.

03:05.622 --> 03:08.791
<i>Au revoir!</i>

03:08.792 --> 03:11.226
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

03:16.365 --> 03:18.200
Blake, have you seen Daisy's ring?

03:18.201 --> 03:19.669
Ooh, yes, and judging by the size,

03:19.670 --> 03:20.937
so did a few astronauts.

03:20.938 --> 03:22.371
- Morning, boss.
- ELIZABETH: Morning.

03:22.372 --> 03:23.973
All right, Daisy, let me see.

03:23.974 --> 03:25.274
Wow!

03:25.275 --> 03:28.311
That is some serious carbon!

03:28.312 --> 03:29.312
Congratulations, really.

03:29.313 --> 03:31.213
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

03:31.214 --> 03:32.281
Prime Minister Diacov ready?

03:32.282 --> 03:34.083
- In the conference room.
- Okay.

03:34.084 --> 03:36.619
NADINE: Here's the latest
digest on Moldova.

03:36.620 --> 03:37.787
The separatists have launched

03:37.788 --> 03:39.355
a new offensive against Diacov

03:39.356 --> 03:40.623
and his government.

03:40.624 --> 03:42.658
Another day, another
democracy in peril.

03:42.659 --> 03:44.160
What's the situation on the ground?

03:44.161 --> 03:45.227
Not good.

03:45.228 --> 03:47.029
The separatist leader, General Kolba,

03:47.030 --> 03:48.731
is particularly ruthless.

03:48.732 --> 03:50.547
He's the one with the tweets,
if you'll remember...

03:50.548 --> 03:51.267
I'm aware.

03:51.268 --> 03:52.535
He's also the one killing

03:52.536 --> 03:54.971
innocent Moldovians in the name of...

03:54.972 --> 03:56.639
restoring the Russian Empire.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.740
- Oh...
- BLAKE: That, too.

03:57.741 --> 03:59.308
Listen, is our other guest ready?

03:59.309 --> 04:00.543
What other guest?

04:00.544 --> 04:03.112
Good man.

04:03.113 --> 04:05.014
DIACOV: My people have
fought like heroes,

04:05.015 --> 04:07.216
Madam Secretary, but...

04:07.217 --> 04:09.752
Kolba's men have the latest equipment

04:09.753 --> 04:11.454
from Moscow, including

04:11.455 --> 04:13.990
MI-24 attack helicopters.

04:13.991 --> 04:16.959
We need American support
to level the playing field.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.563
We believe in the rule
of law, Mr. Diacov.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.265
That's why we oppose
any act of aggression

04:23.266 --> 04:25.167
against a legitimate government.

04:25.168 --> 04:27.403
That is very kind, Madam Secretary.

04:27.404 --> 04:31.073
But when I say "support,"
I mean weapons.

04:31.074 --> 04:32.241
We're working on that.

04:32.242 --> 04:34.477
The Foreign Relations
Committee meets next week.

04:34.478 --> 04:37.713
Forgive me, but I have
no faith in committees.

04:37.714 --> 04:39.782
One of the many reasons I fought to free

04:39.783 --> 04:42.451
my country from the Soviet Union.

04:42.452 --> 04:44.520
I understand your frustration there.

04:44.521 --> 04:46.621
But these things do take time.

04:47.423 --> 04:50.459
That's why I'd like for
you to meet someone.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.393
This is Jim.

04:53.496 --> 04:55.464
- He's an old colleague of mine.
- Prime Minister.

04:55.465 --> 04:56.832
How do you do?

04:56.833 --> 04:58.300
You are CIA?

04:58.301 --> 05:00.136
Not anymore. The secretary saw fit

05:00.137 --> 05:01.170
to bring me over to State.

05:01.171 --> 05:02.571
We ran a number

05:02.572 --> 05:03.939
of operations together.

05:03.940 --> 05:05.641
Including carpools.

05:05.642 --> 05:07.476
Plenty of those.

05:07.477 --> 05:10.079
Jim specializes in
counterinsurgency tactics.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.881
He's gonna help you build

05:11.882 --> 05:14.817
- a strategy to contain Kolba.
- And you can start

05:14.818 --> 05:17.258
by securing your own government
against enemy subversion.

05:17.259 --> 05:20.256
With your permission, I'd like to
send him back to Moldova with you.

05:20.257 --> 05:21.957
Is that wise?

05:21.958 --> 05:23.726
Kolba has spies everywhere.

05:23.727 --> 05:25.928
If your man is discovered,
he may be in danger.

05:25.929 --> 05:28.597
I assure you no one will
know my real identity.

05:28.598 --> 05:29.799
Not even your own staff.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.967
_

05:33.901 --> 05:35.296
_

05:35.538 --> 05:37.406
ELIZABETH: I forgot to mention

05:37.407 --> 05:39.632
Jim's also an ethnic Moldovan.

05:39.633 --> 05:44.113
So, what do you say, Prime Minister?

05:44.114 --> 05:46.148
I say...

05:46.149 --> 05:48.516
welcome aboard.

06:15.811 --> 06:18.212
Shirt, please.

06:23.219 --> 06:26.054
I think you should buy me dinner first.

06:27.590 --> 06:29.959
You must get that all the time.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.559
Yup.

06:33.062 --> 06:34.663
Have you worn a wire before?

06:34.664 --> 06:35.765
First time.

06:35.766 --> 06:37.686
I thought you were gonna
tape something to my chest.

06:37.687 --> 06:39.969
We haven't done that since the '80s.

06:39.970 --> 06:41.137
It's wet.

06:41.138 --> 06:44.240
I was sweating.

06:44.241 --> 06:45.973
Shouldn't be a problem.

06:48.410 --> 06:50.378
We'll be in touch.

06:51.547 --> 06:54.316
COMMENTATOR: <i>And finally,</i>
<i>I want to give a shout out</i>

06:54.317 --> 06:56.152
to Sergei Kolba.

06:56.153 --> 06:59.054
This rouge general, double thumbs-up guy

06:59.055 --> 07:00.789
and prostitute employer

07:00.790 --> 07:02.825
took a break from his military campaign

07:02.826 --> 07:05.361
to tweet about how much
he lusts after the legs

07:05.362 --> 07:06.595
of Secretary of State

07:06.596 --> 07:08.664
Elizabeth McCord. What was the occasion?

07:08.665 --> 07:11.433
Well, apparently Secretary
McCord recently visited

07:11.434 --> 07:13.602
Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Diacov

07:13.603 --> 07:16.405
and separatist leader Kolba got jealous.

07:16.406 --> 07:19.341
So, he retaliated the way
all visionary leaders do.

07:19.342 --> 07:21.710
By throwing a sexist
tantrum on the Internet.

07:21.711 --> 07:24.109
- I like your walking sticks, lady...
- ELIZABETH: Hi, baby.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.549
Off, please?

07:26.550 --> 07:27.683
I'm making stir-fry.

07:27.684 --> 07:29.652
It's oily vegetables.

07:29.653 --> 07:31.620
Meatless Mondays. I'm giving it a try.

07:31.621 --> 07:32.688
Well, good.

07:32.689 --> 07:33.903
(quietly): Whoo...

07:33.904 --> 07:36.544
(quietly): We ordered a double
sausage pizza, if you want to wait.

07:36.545 --> 07:38.994
(quietly): Yes, please.

07:38.995 --> 07:40.930
Hi.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.097
How was your day?

07:42.098 --> 07:43.933
Oh, you know,

07:43.934 --> 07:46.569
just shaping the minds
of tomorrow's leaders.

07:46.570 --> 07:47.836
(both chuckle)

07:47.837 --> 07:48.904
Are you wearing cologne?

07:48.905 --> 07:49.972
No.

07:49.973 --> 07:51.240
(gasps) What's her name?

07:51.241 --> 07:52.208
Mom...!

07:52.209 --> 07:53.742
ALISON: Madison.

07:53.743 --> 07:55.811
He's going to ask her to
go to the mall with him.

07:55.812 --> 07:57.379
You hate shopping.

07:57.380 --> 07:58.747
The National Mall.

07:58.748 --> 07:59.815
There's a concert.

07:59.816 --> 08:01.250
You hate concerts.

08:01.251 --> 08:02.785
Yeah, but I like her.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.253
Does she like you back?

08:04.254 --> 08:05.354
I-I don't, I don't know.

08:05.355 --> 08:07.089
I think so.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.824
You don't sound very confident.

08:08.825 --> 08:11.327
Okay, well, personally,
I didn't think I'd have a shot

08:11.328 --> 08:14.163
at anyone above, like, a six,
but all my friends think

08:14.164 --> 08:16.832
she's at least a seven and a half.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.634
We're using numerals? Really?

08:18.635 --> 08:20.202
- What? They're efficient.
- Oh.

08:20.203 --> 08:23.739
Well, then you might want
to ease up on the scent.

08:23.740 --> 08:25.474
It's up at about 11.

08:25.475 --> 08:26.642
(exhales)

08:26.643 --> 08:29.044
- What did I tell you?
- You told me nothing.

08:29.045 --> 08:30.479
You hit that so hard.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.414
You stink.

08:32.414 --> 08:33.649
You know what?

08:33.650 --> 08:35.884
I don't think I like this Madison girl.

08:35.885 --> 08:38.220
What? Come on, you don't
know anything about her.

08:38.221 --> 08:41.357
I... I know that he thinks
that she's out of his league,

08:41.357 --> 08:43.942
which means she's probably aloof.

08:43.943 --> 08:46.553
A little dismissive. She's
probably just leading him on,

08:46.554 --> 08:48.168
- you know, just or the atten...
- Oh, come on.

08:48.169 --> 08:51.567
Oh, you know what, she is
gonna crush him like a bug.

08:51.568 --> 08:53.736
Hey, stop. He can handle himself.

08:53.737 --> 08:55.771
I think maybe I should
just go talk to him.

08:55.772 --> 08:57.773
Oh, no, I don't think so.
When I was his age,

08:57.774 --> 09:00.509
I would rather die than get
romantic advice from my mother.

09:00.510 --> 09:01.910
Okay, I get it.

09:01.911 --> 09:04.378
I get it. I get that.

09:05.648 --> 09:07.483
So...

09:07.484 --> 09:11.987
other than shaping the minds
of tomorrow's "leaders"...

09:11.988 --> 09:14.555
what really happened today?

09:15.324 --> 09:17.658
I can't talk about it.

09:19.028 --> 09:20.629
Oh.

09:20.630 --> 09:22.697
Really?

09:26.035 --> 09:28.304
Really.

09:28.305 --> 09:31.206
How about you?

09:31.207 --> 09:34.308
Same.

09:39.281 --> 09:42.217
Can I say I'll be glad
when this is over?

09:42.218 --> 09:43.285
You can.

09:43.286 --> 09:48.057
Sometimes I just, I
miss being a professor.

09:48.058 --> 09:50.559
You know, my biggest worry
was whether or not a...

09:50.560 --> 09:52.528
a student was cutting seminar.

09:52.529 --> 09:56.131
And now I spend my days doing
things I can't discuss with you

09:56.132 --> 09:59.168
and... and most nights
sitting up wondering

09:59.169 --> 10:00.602
whether or not my predecessor,

10:00.603 --> 10:01.904
Vincent Marsh, was killed.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.373
Are you gonna bring that
up at the spy reunion?

10:04.374 --> 10:06.141
I haven't really decided.
I mean, those dinners

10:06.142 --> 10:07.876
are supposed to be light and fun.

10:07.877 --> 10:11.279
Murder and conspiracy are
anything but light and fun.

10:11.613 --> 10:13.849
Hey... um...

10:13.850 --> 10:15.884
are you tired?

10:15.885 --> 10:16.852
Yes.

10:16.853 --> 10:18.187
- You are?
- No.

10:18.188 --> 10:19.455
No, I'm not. Why?

10:19.456 --> 10:21.857
- Got any ideas?
- Yeah, I'm working on a few.

10:21.858 --> 10:23.192
- Are you?
- Yeah.

10:23.193 --> 10:25.593
- (laughs)
- Hey.

10:27.896 --> 10:29.465
- Matt.
- Huh?

10:29.466 --> 10:31.367
"Marine hypoxia

10:31.368 --> 10:33.168
is a whale of a problem"?

10:33.169 --> 10:34.870
It's just a little leavening.

10:34.871 --> 10:36.972
Uh, fish are dying, it's
a depressing subject.

10:36.973 --> 10:40.209
Uh, "It's maritime to see change"?

10:40.210 --> 10:42.978
Uh... "we can't flounder
on this issue..."

10:42.979 --> 10:43.979
I'll fix it.

10:43.980 --> 10:45.114
Madam Secretary,

10:45.115 --> 10:46.215
I want to talk about Kolba.

10:46.216 --> 10:47.985
Oh, here we go. What about him?

10:47.986 --> 10:49.648
Daisy wants to release a statement

10:49.649 --> 10:50.819
condemning the general.

10:50.820 --> 10:52.921
Well, he said vile,
despicable things about you.

10:52.922 --> 10:54.022
(scoffing chuckle)

10:54.023 --> 10:55.124
He's hardly the first.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.725
No, but he's by far the worst.

10:56.726 --> 10:57.760
A sample of his tweets.

10:57.761 --> 10:59.094
"She calls me a criminal,

10:59.095 --> 11:01.363
"but it's a crime to hide
those gorgeous legs.

11:01.364 --> 11:03.566
- #WearAMiniskirt."
- (quiet snort)

11:03.567 --> 11:05.913
"She's a soft woman who
loves hard positions."

11:05.914 --> 11:06.576
(groans)

11:06.577 --> 11:09.171
"I have better ideas of how she
could interfere in my affairs."

11:09.172 --> 11:11.740
MATT: Okay, look, you can't
engage with a guy like Kolba.

11:11.741 --> 11:13.512
It's like throwing water on a gremlin.

11:13.513 --> 11:15.333
DAISY: But our silence
looks like weakness.

11:15.334 --> 11:16.912
We can't let him control the narrative.

11:16.913 --> 11:17.980
I agree with Matt.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.582
If I engage with Kolba, the narrative

11:20.583 --> 11:22.551
is that a man accused of war crimes

11:22.552 --> 11:24.787
forced the secretary of state
to treat him as an equal.

11:24.788 --> 11:27.688
Keep him in the doghouse;
it's where he belongs.

11:32.828 --> 11:33.896
Thanks for that.

11:33.897 --> 11:36.664
You're welcome.

11:37.766 --> 11:41.403
Vlad Diacov's flight went off
radar over Moldovan airspace.

11:41.404 --> 11:42.372
What do you mean?

11:42.373 --> 11:45.066
The prime minister's
plane has disappeared.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.592
Jim is missing and feared dead

11:47.593 --> 11:49.959
along with everyone else on board.

11:53.019 --> 12:00.007
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

12:07.357 --> 12:09.916
Our working theory is the
plane was shot down.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.385
Do we have any evidence?

12:11.386 --> 12:13.920
Not yet, but it was near
the border of rebel airspace.

12:13.921 --> 12:15.956
And Kolba?

12:15.957 --> 12:17.591
He denies all involvement.

12:17.592 --> 12:18.625
Well, no surprise there.

12:18.626 --> 12:19.960
I want hourly updates.

12:19.961 --> 12:22.729
And will you get me a meeting
with the head of the NTSB?

12:22.730 --> 12:24.297
Yes, ma'am. Um, and...

12:24.298 --> 12:26.166
Jimmy Ionesco's wife is here.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.833
She's in the SVTC room.

12:31.905 --> 12:33.173
How much does she know?

12:33.174 --> 12:35.207
Nothing.

12:36.276 --> 12:38.811
All right.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.818
Claire...

12:44.819 --> 12:45.886
Just tell me.

12:45.887 --> 12:47.386
I know it's not good.

12:48.955 --> 12:51.724
Your husband went missing
in the line of duty.

12:54.294 --> 12:56.762
So, he was on a mission.

12:58.231 --> 12:59.466
Yes.

12:59.467 --> 13:02.936
He told me he was at a
training session in Dallas.

13:02.937 --> 13:05.005
I had a feeling he was lying,

13:05.006 --> 13:07.441
but I thought all this
covert stuff was over

13:07.442 --> 13:09.541
when he came to the State Department.

13:10.610 --> 13:12.846
What else do you know?

13:12.847 --> 13:16.049
I can tell you that the
mission is top secret

13:16.050 --> 13:17.484
and of great importance.

13:17.485 --> 13:19.885
It always is.

13:23.490 --> 13:26.393
We're doing everything
we can to find him.

13:26.394 --> 13:27.894
Until then, I'm going to ask you

13:27.895 --> 13:30.197
to keep this information confidential.

13:30.198 --> 13:33.098
Yeah, I know; I know the drill.

13:34.034 --> 13:36.136
Can I stay here until you
have more information?

13:36.137 --> 13:38.472
Claire, I don't know how
long it's gonna be.

13:38.473 --> 13:40.606
I don't care.

13:42.676 --> 13:43.743
All right.

13:43.744 --> 13:46.512
If you need anything, you just ask.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.482
I need my husband back.

14:06.666 --> 14:09.833
♪

14:25.185 --> 14:27.986
♪

14:33.627 --> 14:36.596
(keypad buttons beeping)

14:36.597 --> 14:38.697
(a tone sounds, then a latch clicks)

14:41.034 --> 14:42.736
You're late.

14:42.737 --> 14:45.272
All this cloak-and-dagger
stuff takes time.

14:45.273 --> 14:48.275
You're the one who
refuses to meet in public.

14:48.276 --> 14:50.143
That's because the last
time we met in public,

14:50.144 --> 14:52.445
my 20-year-old daughter decided
we were having an affair.

14:52.446 --> 14:54.581
That was regrettable.

14:54.582 --> 14:56.483
What's more regrettable is

14:56.484 --> 14:58.718
that you failed at your
primary objective.

14:58.719 --> 15:00.717
You didn't secure an
invitation to his house.

15:00.718 --> 15:01.514
Couldn't push it.

15:01.515 --> 15:03.390
He was already suspicious
that I was there.

15:03.391 --> 15:04.791
You let him end the conversation.

15:04.792 --> 15:06.893
I took it as far as I could.
It's my call, right?

15:06.894 --> 15:09.930
I appreciate your caution,
but this really can't wait.

15:09.931 --> 15:14.501
That's Klaus in Aleppo,
August of this year.

15:14.502 --> 15:16.136
The man he's with...

15:16.137 --> 15:17.870
Abu Khinjar.

15:19.239 --> 15:22.175
HENRY: Butcher of the Euphrates.

15:22.176 --> 15:25.545
He's personally executed over
a dozen American citizens.

15:25.546 --> 15:26.880
Yes.

15:26.881 --> 15:28.764
Klaus has been laundering
Khinjar's money

15:28.765 --> 15:30.565
through his conservancy for years.

15:30.566 --> 15:32.210
But now that he's in the United States,

15:32.211 --> 15:33.853
we think his focus may be shifting.

15:33.854 --> 15:36.756
He's planning an attack?

15:36.757 --> 15:37.824
When the Syrians agreed

15:37.825 --> 15:39.659
to destroy their chemical
weapons program,

15:39.660 --> 15:41.728
some of that stockpile went missing.

15:41.729 --> 15:45.599
Specifically, several
canisters of sarin gas.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.400
And you think he brought it here.

15:47.401 --> 15:48.902
His code name came up in chatter,

15:48.903 --> 15:50.704
but the details are sketchy.

15:50.705 --> 15:53.073
It's crucial to get ears
inside his residence.

15:53.074 --> 15:57.010
The good news is... you confirmed
that he still has the chess set.

15:57.011 --> 15:58.945
We made an exact copy
based on the photos

15:58.946 --> 16:00.947
you took for us in Jerusalem.

16:00.948 --> 16:03.348
Does this look right?

16:07.053 --> 16:08.355
I think so.

16:08.356 --> 16:09.522
Good.

16:09.523 --> 16:11.391
Let's hope you get a chance to use it.

16:11.392 --> 16:14.860
Thousands of lives could be at stake.

16:16.263 --> 16:18.498
The gaggle wants a
statement on the plane.

16:18.499 --> 16:19.532
Hold them off.

16:19.533 --> 16:20.778
I can't. It's not every day

16:20.779 --> 16:22.902
that a head of state goes
missing; they want answers.

16:22.903 --> 16:25.071
Fine, Matt can draft something,

16:25.072 --> 16:25.952
but be careful.

16:25.953 --> 16:28.074
Jim's presence on the
plane is still classified.

16:28.075 --> 16:29.776
So you want us to downplay our reaction.

16:29.777 --> 16:31.978
Exactly, but not too much.

16:31.979 --> 16:34.681
So we need to express concern
without seeming too concerned.

16:34.682 --> 16:35.649
Exactly.

16:35.650 --> 16:37.175
JAY: Have we ruled anything out?

16:37.176 --> 16:39.052
It was obviously a missile strike.

16:39.053 --> 16:40.124
What else could it be?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.655
A fire could have knocked
out the electronics,

16:41.656 --> 16:43.162
that would explain the
transponders turning off.

16:43.163 --> 16:44.324
The MH370 theory?

16:44.325 --> 16:47.060
- I don't buy it.
- DAISY: Sometimes things just go wrong.

16:47.061 --> 16:48.628
Doesn't mean that it's anyone's fault.

16:48.629 --> 16:51.197
It's always somebody's fault.
Somewhere along the line,

16:51.198 --> 16:53.833
a person makes a really bad decision.

16:53.834 --> 16:56.703
I'm sorry, are we still
talking about the plane?

16:56.704 --> 16:59.739
- BOTH: Yes, we're talking about the plane.
- NADINE: Enough. Please.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.532
The secretary is in there right now

17:01.533 --> 17:03.376
with the chairman of the NTSB,

17:03.377 --> 17:05.306
so we'll probably know something soon.

17:05.307 --> 17:06.013
Until then,

17:06.015 --> 17:08.315
I'd like you all to quit speculating

17:08.316 --> 17:10.315
and do your jobs.

17:15.021 --> 17:16.356
It wasn't shot down.

17:16.357 --> 17:19.025
NATO analysis is confirming
there were no missile launches

17:19.026 --> 17:21.194
in the vicinity of Diacov's plane.

17:21.194 --> 17:22.628
What about a midair bombing?

17:22.630 --> 17:24.321
No, the baggage was screened at Andrews.

17:24.323 --> 17:25.693
And there's no sign of wreckage.

17:25.694 --> 17:26.766
Not yet.

17:26.767 --> 17:29.836
The last transponder ping was
over extremely rugged terrain,

17:29.837 --> 17:32.864
so it could be a while
before we spot something.

17:32.865 --> 17:35.296
All right, let's get more
surveillance drones in the area.

17:35.297 --> 17:37.110
I want to close this grid
as fast as possible.

17:37.111 --> 17:40.580
Yes, Madam Secretary.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.048
Mr. Chairman, before you go...

17:42.049 --> 17:44.084
I saw the report on

17:44.085 --> 17:46.086
Secretary Marsh's plane crash.

17:46.087 --> 17:48.221
- You ruled it an accident.
- That's right.

17:48.222 --> 17:50.690
The aircraft suffered
a catastrophic failure

17:50.691 --> 17:52.659
of a screw, uh, controlling the rudder.

17:52.660 --> 17:53.827
We call that an FSCAP...

17:53.828 --> 17:55.862
Flight safety critical
aircraft part... I know.

17:55.863 --> 17:57.630
Yes, ma'am.

17:57.631 --> 17:59.432
The pilot had no chance to recover.

17:59.433 --> 18:02.235
Was the ground crew ever polygraphed?

18:02.236 --> 18:04.838
I'm sorry, what are you suggesting?

18:04.839 --> 18:06.506
Just answer the question.

18:06.507 --> 18:08.508
No, Madam Secretary.

18:08.509 --> 18:09.876
That isn't protocol.

18:09.877 --> 18:12.344
Great. Thank you.

18:25.992 --> 18:29.829
They said I could find you here.

18:29.830 --> 18:30.897
Klaus.

18:30.898 --> 18:33.166
What brings you to my
neck of the woods?

18:33.167 --> 18:36.469
I regret to say that I could
not find your Kierkegaard,

18:36.470 --> 18:40.373
so I thought that you might
accept this manuscript instead.

18:40.374 --> 18:44.210
Ibn Sina... Avicenna, as
the Latins called him.

18:44.211 --> 18:47.447
I love his thought
experiment "Floating Man."

18:47.448 --> 18:49.249
Centuries ahead of Descartes.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.750
Indeed.

18:50.751 --> 18:52.852
I received your e-mail.
I'm sorry to say

18:52.853 --> 18:54.754
I cannot come to lunch.

18:54.755 --> 18:56.956
Um, however, I'm having

18:56.957 --> 18:59.025
a little gathering tonight

18:59.026 --> 19:00.727
at my home. If you are not

19:00.728 --> 19:03.363
otherwise engaged, perhaps
you would like to attend?

19:03.364 --> 19:05.231
I would be honored.

19:05.232 --> 19:07.799
Excellent.

19:16.792 --> 19:19.228
How does a plane that
size just disappear?

19:19.229 --> 19:21.553
I don't know, but we're
clutching at straws here.

19:21.554 --> 19:23.615
We could expand the search area.

19:23.616 --> 19:26.017
Oh, that could take weeks.

19:28.086 --> 19:30.322
Diacov said that Kolba's
got spies everywhere.

19:30.323 --> 19:32.424
We need to reach out to the Moldovans,

19:32.425 --> 19:34.860
<i>take a hard look at
everyone who was onboard.</i>

19:34.861 --> 19:36.595
You really think it was an inside job?

19:36.596 --> 19:40.131
I at least think we need to rule it out.

19:46.705 --> 19:48.207
You guys shouldn't have waited.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.708
We aren't hungry.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.076
Not anymore.

19:51.077 --> 19:52.244
You dropped a bombshell.

19:52.245 --> 19:53.345
Yeah, I know.

19:53.346 --> 19:55.280
But it's been weighing on me.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.816
I think I was right to tell you.

19:57.817 --> 19:59.918
Secretary Marsh was murdered.

19:59.919 --> 20:02.417
I'm sorry, do you have any
idea how crazy that sounds?

20:02.418 --> 20:04.289
Isabelle, I know exactly how it sounds.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.799
But I think George was telling the truth

20:07.727 --> 20:09.228
George was unhinged.

20:09.229 --> 20:12.297
- He was acting out at Langley, having...
- He was struggling, Bess.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.765
- Yeah, he never...
- We all saw that.

20:13.766 --> 20:16.335
- He never adjusted to life as an analyst.
- I know.

20:16.336 --> 20:19.371
But George's car accident doesn't add up.

20:19.372 --> 20:21.940
George was meticulous.
He planned everything.

20:21.941 --> 20:24.343
Do you really think that
he would kill himself

20:24.344 --> 20:27.379
by spontaneously driving
into a telephone pole?

20:27.380 --> 20:29.280
(Isabelle sighs)

20:33.218 --> 20:34.686
I agree.

20:34.687 --> 20:36.855
What? You do?

20:36.856 --> 20:38.257
It never made sense,

20:38.258 --> 20:41.271
- the way George died.
- Where's the evidence?

20:41.272 --> 20:43.607
I don't know. That's why
I'm asking for your help.

20:43.608 --> 20:45.374
Why didn't you go straight to Munsey?

20:45.375 --> 20:47.477
Because George said Marsh's plane crash

20:47.478 --> 20:50.180
was arranged by someone
inside the company.

20:50.181 --> 20:52.883
For all I know, it could be him.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.551
So you told us instead.

20:54.552 --> 20:57.254
You're the only ones I can trust.

20:57.255 --> 21:00.324
There are only two outcomes here.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.459
- (phone buzzes)
- Either we're crazy conspiracy theorists,

21:02.460 --> 21:05.195
or you're right and you
just put our lives in danger.

21:05.196 --> 21:06.263
- It's okay.
- No,

21:06.264 --> 21:07.698
it's really not. She has no idea _

21:07.699 --> 21:08.899
what she's getting us into.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.667
ELIZABETH: I gotta go.

21:10.668 --> 21:12.169
I know it's a lot to ask.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.171
If you're not interested,

21:14.172 --> 21:17.907
this conversation never took place.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.847
(indistinct conversations)

21:23.848 --> 21:28.851
(conversing in Arabic)

21:30.587 --> 21:31.989
(both men laugh)

21:31.990 --> 21:33.824
Your friend speaks like
a native, did you know?

21:33.825 --> 21:35.207
I had a feeling.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.527
Benefits of childhood in Tunis.

21:37.528 --> 21:40.564
My parents were diplomats...

21:40.565 --> 21:42.766
but Henry knows all about
living with diplomats.

21:42.767 --> 21:43.867
Don't you?

21:43.868 --> 21:44.906
All too well.

21:44.907 --> 21:46.734
I admire your wife, Dr. McCord.

21:46.735 --> 21:47.671
She speaks Arabic, too.

21:47.672 --> 21:49.139
Has she taught you anything?

21:49.140 --> 21:50.173
Just the curse words.

21:50.174 --> 21:51.279
(laughs)

21:51.280 --> 21:53.076
Klaus, can you point me
towards the restroom?

21:53.077 --> 21:54.978
End of hallway, straight ahead.

21:54.979 --> 21:56.579
Excuse me.

22:26.710 --> 22:29.178
♪

22:46.596 --> 22:49.399
It's too heavy, he'll notice.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.401
SARAH (over earpiece):
Does it look identical?

22:51.402 --> 22:52.736
Yes.

22:52.737 --> 22:55.838
<i>Your call.</i>

23:01.578 --> 23:02.945
Hey.

23:03.613 --> 23:07.517
I saw it when I was walking by, and...

23:07.518 --> 23:08.919
I couldn't resist.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.054
I don't suppose there's any way

23:11.055 --> 23:13.724
that I could take this off your hands?

23:13.725 --> 23:15.429
Perhaps you can play for it,

23:15.430 --> 23:17.497
after the guests have gone?

23:20.768 --> 23:22.303
I think we're looking at a hijacking.

23:22.304 --> 23:25.862
Two months ago, the copilot of
Prime Minister Diacov's flight

23:25.863 --> 23:27.363
visited the Crimea.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.064
Not your typical holiday spot.

23:29.065 --> 23:30.433
Turkish intelligence has evidence

23:30.434 --> 23:32.201
that he took a meeting
with General Kolba.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.604
And we're just learning this now?

23:34.605 --> 23:36.305
Our relationships with the Turks

23:36.306 --> 23:37.573
isn't what it used to be.

23:37.574 --> 23:40.510
I had to practice a little
diplomacy of my own.

23:40.511 --> 23:41.678
We think the copilot

23:41.679 --> 23:43.913
killed the captain, turned
off the transponders

23:43.914 --> 23:45.815
and then took over the plane.

23:45.816 --> 23:46.883
That's a great theory,

23:46.884 --> 23:49.052
but do you have any proof?

23:49.053 --> 23:51.157
20 minutes ago, one of
our satellites found this

23:51.158 --> 23:54.165
at an ex-Soviet air base
in rebel territory.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.309
There's no doubt about it...

23:55.310 --> 23:56.796
the markings are an exact match

23:56.797 --> 23:58.806
for Diacov's plane.

24:09.731 --> 24:12.099
(timer ticking)

24:27.001 --> 24:29.802
(sighs)

24:56.842 --> 24:59.549
Please, don't hold back on my account.

24:59.550 --> 25:00.911
No, no, it's not that.

25:00.912 --> 25:02.479
My wife expected me home an hour ago.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.413
(clears throat)

25:06.950 --> 25:08.419
What would you say to a draw?

25:08.420 --> 25:10.087
But... (laughs)

25:10.088 --> 25:11.187
...you have the advantage.

25:11.188 --> 25:13.856
And you have a wicked endgame.

25:13.857 --> 25:16.626
Honestly, I would rather save my energy

25:16.627 --> 25:18.326
for the drive home.

25:20.129 --> 25:21.497
Very well, I accept.

25:21.498 --> 25:23.465
(taps timer, ticking stops)

25:24.167 --> 25:26.135
But the chess set

25:26.136 --> 25:27.270
belongs to you.

25:27.271 --> 25:28.938
Oh, come on.

25:28.939 --> 25:30.740
It has to be a real victory.

25:30.741 --> 25:32.108
I insist.

25:32.109 --> 25:34.977
Klaus, come on. Seriously.

25:34.978 --> 25:37.013
It's a noble gesture, but I can't.

25:37.014 --> 25:37.980
Hmm.

25:37.981 --> 25:41.350
You Americans are a proud breed.

25:41.351 --> 25:43.652
It's our fatal flaw.

25:44.587 --> 25:46.122
MUNSEY: <i>We have confirmation.</i>

25:46.123 --> 25:47.415
<i>It's the missing plane.</i>

25:47.416 --> 25:49.225
Is General Kolba at the airfield?

25:49.226 --> 25:51.194
His base of operations
is a few miles away,

25:51.195 --> 25:52.428
but he makes regular visits.

25:52.429 --> 25:54.397
That's a brilliant plan.

25:54.398 --> 25:57.500
Eliminate your rival while
avoiding international scorn.

25:57.501 --> 25:59.135
Your guy must've been
a fly in the ointment.

25:59.136 --> 26:00.803
What's his cover?

26:00.804 --> 26:02.105
He's a speechwriter,

26:02.106 --> 26:03.306
but that's not gonna hold for long.

26:03.307 --> 26:04.413
Kolba might already know.

26:04.414 --> 26:05.679
But we don't know what he does know.

26:05.680 --> 26:06.889
That's why we have to act fast.

26:06.890 --> 26:08.678
Nadine, will you check on Claire for me?

26:08.679 --> 26:10.313
What should I tell her?

26:10.314 --> 26:12.248
As little as possible.

26:12.249 --> 26:14.428
Shall I brief the staff?

26:14.429 --> 26:17.253
No. I want to keep the circle tight.

26:17.254 --> 26:19.254
Jim's life may depend on it.

26:21.758 --> 26:23.326
(sighs)

26:23.327 --> 26:25.760
(door slides open)

26:27.196 --> 26:28.297
Oh.

26:28.298 --> 26:29.365
Sorry to wake you.

26:29.366 --> 26:31.667
Is he dead?

26:31.668 --> 26:33.736
Uh, well, we don't know.

26:33.737 --> 26:36.172
We do have some more information,

26:36.173 --> 26:38.908
but we can't verify his status yet.

26:38.909 --> 26:40.510
Uh, I'm sorry.

26:40.511 --> 26:43.079
I thought I'd be more prepared for this.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.579
I understand.

26:45.948 --> 26:47.850
It's one thing to believe in sacrifice;

26:47.851 --> 26:49.851
it's another thing to live with it.

26:53.756 --> 26:54.824
I just...

26:54.825 --> 26:56.192
I just don't know

26:56.193 --> 26:57.660
how much more of this I can take.

26:57.661 --> 26:59.060
Oh.

27:01.464 --> 27:04.867
You have every reason to hope.

27:04.868 --> 27:08.371
Kolba's headquarters are a few
miles outside of the airfield,

27:08.372 --> 27:12.008
but our HUMINT source indicates
Diacov and Jimmy Ionesco

27:12.009 --> 27:14.143
are captured and being
held in the control tower

27:14.144 --> 27:15.678
at the north end of the base.

27:15.679 --> 27:16.979
Are they still alive?

27:16.980 --> 27:17.980
Unknown.

27:17.981 --> 27:19.415
What was Kolba thinking?

27:19.416 --> 27:21.617
He was thinking that he was
gonna get away with it.

27:21.618 --> 27:22.852
He nearly did.

27:22.853 --> 27:25.721
I assume you want to
pursue some kind of...

27:25.722 --> 27:27.824
back channel negotiation?

27:27.825 --> 27:30.026
No. We don't have time for that.

27:30.027 --> 27:31.260
I support the military option.

27:31.261 --> 27:32.995
At this point, we still have

27:32.996 --> 27:34.130
the element of surprise.

27:34.131 --> 27:36.132
Kolba doesn't know we found the plane.

27:36.133 --> 27:37.400
Admiral Parker?

27:37.401 --> 27:40.069
I take your point, Madam Secretary,

27:40.070 --> 27:42.137
but the situation is not optimal.

27:42.138 --> 27:45.407
We can send a team of SEALs
in a specially equipped C-130.

27:45.408 --> 27:47.409
If they fly low and under
the cover of darkness,

27:47.410 --> 27:49.311
we can have 'em on the
ground in eight hours.

27:49.312 --> 27:51.013
The problem is what happens next.

27:51.014 --> 27:52.614
That control tower is heavily guarded.

27:52.615 --> 27:55.757
We're talking dozens of veteran
troops, gun emplacements,

27:55.758 --> 27:57.890
- and the latest Russian hardware.
- What's the estimate

27:57.891 --> 27:58.821
on casualties?

27:58.822 --> 28:00.890
PARKER: With the element
of surprise, zero to five.

28:00.891 --> 28:01.924
But without it,

28:01.925 --> 28:03.259
I think there's a strong chance

28:03.260 --> 28:05.427
we lose more guys than we save.

28:06.395 --> 28:08.965
Kolba drives a Rolls, right?

28:08.966 --> 28:10.132
A white Phantom.

28:10.133 --> 28:13.302
And a couple of SUVs
for his, uh, bodyguards.

28:13.303 --> 28:15.104
I led an op, back in the '90s,

28:15.105 --> 28:18.641
in Sarajevo, called
Operation Broken Kingdom.

28:18.642 --> 28:19.909
MUNSEY: It was a...

28:19.910 --> 28:22.745
deception play... the Serb
commander drove a Jaguar.

28:22.746 --> 28:24.680
Right, a '71 E-Type.

28:24.681 --> 28:26.916
It was the only one
within a 100-mile radius.

28:26.917 --> 28:29.060
The man and the car were synonymous.

28:29.061 --> 28:30.453
Like Kolba and his Phantom.

28:30.454 --> 28:31.754
Exactly. C-Can you fit

28:31.755 --> 28:34.457
a-a Rolls-Royce inside a Hercules?

28:34.458 --> 28:35.858
Easily.

28:35.859 --> 28:38.194
So what if we impersonate Kolba,

28:38.195 --> 28:40.630
drive right up to the tower?

28:40.631 --> 28:42.999
We'd be inside before they'd
know what happened.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.133
That's a bold idea,

28:44.134 --> 28:47.303
but I can already think
of one obvious flaw.

28:47.304 --> 28:48.504
Which is?

28:48.505 --> 28:50.006
Kolba's routine is unpredictable,

28:50.007 --> 28:52.608
and he visits the base frequently.

28:52.609 --> 28:54.343
If he's there at the
same time as our guys...

28:54.344 --> 28:56.712
They'll know we're coming.

28:56.713 --> 28:59.015
I guess that settles that.

28:59.016 --> 29:03.351
Uh, actually, Admiral, I may
have a plan for that, too.

29:04.654 --> 29:06.322
If it doesn't work,

29:06.323 --> 29:10.859
I can hold my nose
and try and negotiate.

29:12.295 --> 29:13.696
I feel like we're not in the loop.

29:13.697 --> 29:16.699
I feel like we're at the bottom
of a deep, dark loophole.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.167
Again with the puns.

29:18.168 --> 29:20.436
Uh, it's called coping. Why
don't you try it sometime?

29:20.437 --> 29:21.637
We need to talk to Kolba.

29:21.638 --> 29:23.839
Talk to him? Yesterday
you wanted to condemn him.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.108
Well, we've searched everywhere
except in Kolba's territory.

29:26.109 --> 29:28.044
We need his help finding that plane.

29:28.045 --> 29:29.812
We're talking about a guy
who's up to his neck

29:29.813 --> 29:31.681
in torture, abduction, and murder.

29:31.682 --> 29:32.848
Well, I believe in engagement.

29:32.849 --> 29:34.684
- Yeah, no kidding.
- I'm serious.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.019
The whole point of
diplomacy is to negotiate.

29:37.020 --> 29:38.921
We draw the line at terrorists.

29:38.922 --> 29:40.323
Well, Blake agrees with me.

29:40.324 --> 29:41.857
Don't you, Blake?

29:41.858 --> 29:43.758
Blake wishes he had earplugs.

29:45.194 --> 29:48.164
The bug is active.

29:48.165 --> 29:50.866
So that's it?

29:50.867 --> 29:53.701
As far as we're concerned.

29:56.405 --> 29:58.612
- You still need me.
- The White House

29:58.613 --> 30:01.644
was very clear about the
parameters of this operation.

30:01.645 --> 30:03.112
It's over.

30:03.113 --> 30:06.282
Do you know what sarin gas
does to a person's body?

30:06.283 --> 30:09.685
My kids go to school just
a few miles from here.

30:09.686 --> 30:12.688
If I can help, there's no way
I'm gonna sit on the sideline.

30:12.689 --> 30:15.758
Staying in contact puts
your life at risk.

30:15.759 --> 30:17.879
If he finds the bug,
he'll know it was you.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.028
Do you think I don't know that?

30:19.029 --> 30:20.796
Risks change.

30:20.797 --> 30:22.732
My commitment doesn't.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.300
We'll see what the president says.

30:26.002 --> 30:29.105
But if we do go forward,
I need to remind you

30:29.106 --> 30:32.375
that the Intelligence Identities
Protection Act of 1982

30:32.376 --> 30:35.344
forbids you from sharing
that involvement with anyone

30:35.345 --> 30:37.313
who isn't cleared,

30:37.314 --> 30:39.447
including your wife.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.420
- Do you want my help?
- No, I'm good.

30:44.421 --> 30:46.355
'Cause "expiration" is
not spelled like that.

30:46.356 --> 30:48.124
DAISY: Uh, any word?

30:48.125 --> 30:49.959
She's on with the admiral right now.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.093
What's the deal, Blake?

30:51.094 --> 30:52.395
You know what I know.

30:52.396 --> 30:54.096
What do you know?

30:54.097 --> 30:56.399
I know that you are violating
my personal space.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.933
- ELIZABETH: Blake?
- Yeah.

30:57.934 --> 31:00.036
Can you get me General
Kolba on the line?

31:00.037 --> 31:01.504
- Yeah.
- Ma'am...

31:01.505 --> 31:03.706
may I point out that the Secretary

31:03.707 --> 31:05.775
of State is explicitly forbidden

31:05.776 --> 31:08.511
from negotiating with
unrecognized states?

31:08.512 --> 31:11.447
Well, there's a first for everything.

31:11.448 --> 31:12.481
Get me Kolba.

31:12.482 --> 31:14.248
Let me know when we're connected.

31:15.184 --> 31:16.552
Are you kidding me?

31:16.553 --> 31:17.953
I can't believe she caved.

31:17.954 --> 31:18.888
It's the right move.

31:18.889 --> 31:20.189
Excuse me. I'm about to place

31:20.190 --> 31:22.258
a very important phone call
to a misogynist warlord.

31:22.259 --> 31:25.027
So if you two could take this
conversation somewhere else,

31:25.028 --> 31:26.295
that'd be great.

31:26.296 --> 31:28.630
Thank you.

31:34.537 --> 31:36.572
I have General Kolba on video chat.

31:36.573 --> 31:38.674
What, was he out of
minutes on his phone?

31:38.675 --> 31:41.236
It was the first thing that worked.
Do you want me to cancel it or...

31:41.237 --> 31:43.646
No, um... patch the feed

31:43.647 --> 31:45.580
in here.

31:51.654 --> 31:54.022
(sighs)

31:59.795 --> 32:01.630
(clears throat)

32:01.631 --> 32:03.399
Madam Secretary.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.367
What an unexpected pleasure.

32:05.368 --> 32:08.070
General, it's time we had a talk.

32:08.071 --> 32:10.072
By all means.

32:10.073 --> 32:12.040
We have so much to discuss.

32:14.343 --> 32:16.679
But where are your beautiful legs?

32:16.680 --> 32:19.682
They're under the table,
where they're going to stay.

32:19.683 --> 32:21.550
I'll cut to the chase.

32:21.551 --> 32:24.619
I need your help to find this plane.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.628
(speaking Romanian)

32:35.164 --> 32:38.066
(speaking Romanian)

32:48.410 --> 32:50.679
I would love to help you,

32:50.680 --> 32:53.182
but your government supports
the criminals in Chisinau.

32:53.183 --> 32:56.752
Well, that position may
be open to change.

32:56.753 --> 33:00.256
So I'm hoping, as equal partners,

33:00.257 --> 33:03.057
we can find a peaceful way forward.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.947
(rapid beeping)

33:35.591 --> 33:38.260
- (gunshot)
- Move! Move! Move!

33:38.261 --> 33:40.261
Get upstairs. Bravo team.

33:44.233 --> 33:47.670
I insist on public recognition
for my government.

33:47.671 --> 33:49.572
That's not feasible.

33:49.573 --> 33:51.640
I can ease travel restrictions

33:51.641 --> 33:53.075
for you and your entourage,

33:53.076 --> 33:55.643
but then, I want something in return.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.224
He's dead.

34:08.225 --> 34:11.092
Prime Minister Diacov's dead.

34:11.094 --> 34:14.530
I also want immunity from the
International Criminal Court.

34:14.531 --> 34:17.132
That's a complex process
that involves third parties.

34:17.132 --> 34:20.501
I'm sure a minx like
you can make it work.

34:22.271 --> 34:24.672
(gunfire)

34:28.844 --> 34:31.212
Clear!

34:32.915 --> 34:34.917
What's your name?

34:34.918 --> 34:38.254
You certainly aren't shy
about making demands.

34:38.255 --> 34:40.956
I am never shy around
a beautiful woman.

34:40.956 --> 34:44.827
But if you fail to comply,
little lady, you will be sorry.

34:44.828 --> 34:49.096
I have tricks up my sleeve
like you cannot imagine.

34:55.748 --> 34:57.260
_

34:57.339 --> 35:00.109
Gosh, General, you seem
to be terribly busy.

35:00.110 --> 35:02.710
I'll call back another time.

35:03.345 --> 35:04.712
(enraged shout)

35:06.181 --> 35:08.549
(sighs)

35:20.725 --> 35:24.362
The new prime minister
was sworn in an hour ago.

35:24.363 --> 35:26.564
She's taking public
credit for the operation.

35:26.565 --> 35:28.800
I hear Kolba's forces are in retreat.

35:28.801 --> 35:30.401
More like collapsing.

35:30.402 --> 35:31.936
After we took out his air force,

35:31.937 --> 35:33.438
the majority of his men deserted.

35:33.439 --> 35:35.707
Yeah, our Russian friends
can't be happy about that.

35:35.708 --> 35:37.509
They're fuming,

35:37.510 --> 35:39.778
but they know they don't
have a leg to stand on.

35:39.779 --> 35:41.679
Oh, please. Enough talk about legs.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.383
Russell... was that a joke?

35:45.384 --> 35:47.652
It was in the neighborhood.

35:47.653 --> 35:49.921
What's the status on

35:49.922 --> 35:51.523
Jimmy Ionesco?

35:51.524 --> 35:53.444
His plane touches down
tomorrow afternoon.

35:53.445 --> 35:55.059
Good. President would like to meet him.

35:55.060 --> 35:57.028
You bet.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.197
Soon as he's reunited with his family.

35:59.198 --> 36:02.167
That was a great play
you made with the general.

36:02.168 --> 36:04.769
What gave you the idea?

36:04.770 --> 36:07.739
I'd tell you...

36:07.740 --> 36:10.407
but you don't need to know.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.513
REPORTER: The mourners
gathered by the thousands

36:15.514 --> 36:17.618
- at the Nativity...
- NADINE: They're late again.

36:17.619 --> 36:19.884
Are you surprised?

36:19.885 --> 36:21.352
...paying tribute to
Prime Minister Vlad Diacov.

36:21.353 --> 36:22.453
I'm getting married.

36:22.454 --> 36:23.688
I need you to respect that.

36:23.689 --> 36:25.657
And I respect you too
much to respect that.

36:25.658 --> 36:26.925
You're too good for that guy.

36:26.926 --> 36:27.931
You've never even met him.

36:27.932 --> 36:29.594
His name is Win, for crying out loud.

36:29.595 --> 36:30.895
You really want to be the mother

36:30.896 --> 36:32.564
of Winthrop the Third?

36:32.565 --> 36:34.265
The fourth, actually, and, yes, I do.

36:34.266 --> 36:35.433
I don't believe you.

36:35.434 --> 36:37.402
What? Let's get started.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.536
NADINE: Blake,

36:38.537 --> 36:39.604
would you excuse us, please?

36:39.605 --> 36:41.638
Oh, thank God.

36:42.874 --> 36:44.809
Your personal lives

36:44.810 --> 36:48.680
are your own affair, but
they become my business

36:48.681 --> 36:51.615
when they interfere with
the operation of this office.

36:53.151 --> 36:55.253
I'm tempted to make you spend the rest

36:55.254 --> 36:57.388
of the afternoon stamping passports,

36:57.389 --> 37:01.025
but since I believe in
taking the high road,

37:01.026 --> 37:03.994
I'll let you come with me.

37:31.589 --> 37:34.057
♪

37:50.541 --> 37:52.356
Ah-ah! Are those soccer cleats?

37:52.357 --> 37:53.245
Yeah. I just got them.

37:53.246 --> 37:54.479
Let me rephrase.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.539
Are those soccer cleats
inside the house...

37:56.540 --> 37:58.270
- Sorry.
- ...on the floors we just had refinished?

37:58.271 --> 37:59.017
Okay.

37:59.018 --> 37:59.884
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:59.885 --> 38:01.152
Hey. Madison said yes.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.654
- Great.
- ALISON: You're kidding.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.122
Who has two thumbs

38:04.123 --> 38:06.163
- and is a total player?
- Oh, that's great.

38:06.164 --> 38:08.826
Yeah, well, here's the thing:

38:08.827 --> 38:10.228
Madison has this friend, Eve,

38:10.229 --> 38:11.930
and I can tell she's super jealous.

38:11.931 --> 38:14.032
Eve is like an eight and
a half, and she's...

38:14.033 --> 38:16.794
she is super hot, so I think... I think

38:16.795 --> 38:18.035
I might ask her out instead.

38:18.036 --> 38:20.237
- You want to take this one?
- Yeah, I got it.

38:20.238 --> 38:22.506
Jason, give me a hand with
the garbage, would you?

38:22.507 --> 38:23.607
- Please?
- Yeah.

38:23.608 --> 38:25.900
- Ooh.
- This is not looking so good.

38:25.901 --> 38:28.844
Yes, it is. It's supposed...
to be black.

38:30.213 --> 38:31.014
Ooh.

38:31.015 --> 38:32.316
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God!

38:32.317 --> 38:34.017
(muttering) Okay, I'm done.

38:34.018 --> 38:35.152
Take out. Take out.

38:35.153 --> 38:36.486
I'm ordering out.

38:36.487 --> 38:39.823
All right, pal, we got
to talk about girls.

38:39.824 --> 38:41.705
Again? Yeah, I know how it works, Dad.

38:41.706 --> 38:43.672
No, not that talk...

38:43.673 --> 38:46.075
- We got to talk about respecting girls.
- I respect girls.

38:46.076 --> 38:48.010
Dude, you're grading
them like sides of beef.

38:48.011 --> 38:50.012
How would you feel if
somebody talked that way

38:50.013 --> 38:51.514
about Alison or Stevie?

38:51.515 --> 38:52.781
I don't know.

38:52.782 --> 38:55.117
All right, look...

38:55.118 --> 38:56.919
you're a savvy guy.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.754
I'm not surprised Madison likes you.

38:58.755 --> 39:02.625
But if you want girls to <i>love</i> you...

39:02.626 --> 39:05.494
and someday, you're gonna be
in love... then, you got be

39:05.495 --> 39:07.429
a little more than clever;
you got to be respectful.

39:07.430 --> 39:09.431
- You got it?
- (sighs)

39:09.432 --> 39:13.102
All right, I'll, um...

39:13.103 --> 39:14.603
I'll take Madison to the concert.

39:14.604 --> 39:16.138
Good, and listen,

39:16.139 --> 39:18.541
don't feel like you have
to make too many jokes.

39:18.542 --> 39:20.509
When she talks, just listen.

39:20.510 --> 39:22.810
What, does that actually work?

39:23.546 --> 39:25.314
Ask your mother.

39:25.315 --> 39:26.714
(scoffs)

39:28.851 --> 39:30.553
HENRY: I'm proud of you, you know.

39:30.554 --> 39:32.221
ELIZABETH: What for?

39:32.222 --> 39:37.560
Well, for saving Moldova
and humiliating Kolba.

39:37.561 --> 39:39.929
What makes you think I had
anything to do with that?

39:39.930 --> 39:42.398
Oh, come on, I can read signs.

39:42.399 --> 39:44.033
I got tradecraft.

39:44.034 --> 39:46.035
(laughs)

39:46.036 --> 39:48.470
Hey about that... is it over?

39:48.471 --> 39:50.139
Is what over?

39:50.140 --> 39:53.542
(mutters) The NSA thing.

39:53.543 --> 39:57.880
Yes. It's over.

39:57.881 --> 40:00.482
Thank God.

40:00.483 --> 40:03.786
I was afraid maybe you liked it.

40:03.787 --> 40:05.888
No.

40:05.889 --> 40:08.357
I was glad I could help, but...

40:08.358 --> 40:11.592
it's not for me.

40:15.598 --> 40:17.965
(phone buzzing)

40:23.973 --> 40:26.374
Yeah.

40:27.543 --> 40:29.944
Yeah.

40:41.457 --> 40:43.759
I haven't slept after what you told me.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.661
Oh, I know the feeling.

40:48.030 --> 40:50.399
All right, you're still mad at me.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.334
Of course I am.

40:52.335 --> 40:54.236
Well, Juliet believes me.

40:54.237 --> 40:56.939
Juliet has two kids in preschool.

40:56.940 --> 40:59.375
I think she wants to see them grow up.

40:59.376 --> 41:00.709
You know I'm right.

41:00.710 --> 41:02.311
George is dead, Bess.

41:02.312 --> 41:04.312
We don't want to be next.

41:06.615 --> 41:08.584
Then I'll do it alone.

41:08.585 --> 41:11.052
It's not that simple.

41:12.488 --> 41:16.157
It was postmarked the day he died.

41:17.559 --> 41:19.528
George sent you this?

41:19.529 --> 41:21.597
He owed me for a valet
a couple months back.

41:21.598 --> 41:23.297
Look at this.

41:26.535 --> 41:28.203
What does that mean?

41:28.204 --> 41:30.973
I don't even know if he wrote it.

41:30.974 --> 41:35.244
But I think maybe he
wanted me to help you.

41:35.245 --> 41:37.012
What are you saying?

41:37.013 --> 41:39.515
Juliet's out,

41:39.516 --> 41:41.883
but I'm in.

41:45.654 --> 41:47.755
Good.
