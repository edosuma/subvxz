(mellow music playing)

00:54.500 --> 00:55.633
(door opening)

00:58.700 --> 01:02.900
-Oh, hi, Ma. How was bingo?
-Judge for yourself.

01:04.734 --> 01:06.900
Ma, you don't have any clothes on.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.967
Tell me about it.
I just walked 10 blocks.

01:10.033 --> 01:11.834
I got a bellybutton full of tweed.

01:13.233 --> 01:16.500
-Ma, what the hell happened?
-In the middle of bingo,

01:16.567 --> 01:18.500
Maury Hazeltine sits down.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.967
He's the big practical joker
at the center.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.900
Believe me,
Howie Mandel is funnier.

01:24.734 --> 01:27.934
He tells me to sniff his carnation
for good luck.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.266
-I take one whiff, and bingo.
-He squirted your dress with ink.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.400
Actually, it was Del Monte prune juice.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.066
It's free at the center. It's a come-on.

01:37.133 --> 01:40.600
They make their real money
on padded toilet seat rentals.

01:41.967 --> 01:45.033
-What happened to your clothes?
-Maury took them to be cleaned.

01:45.367 --> 01:48.900
I still can't believe it.
I've never been so humiliated.

01:48.967 --> 01:53.533
You shouldn't be embarrassed.
He plays tricks on everybody.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.266
I'm talking about on my way home.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.667
My belt came loose
in front of a construction site.

02:00.533 --> 02:03.200
Nobody whistled,
and two guys went home sick.

02:07.033 --> 02:09.367
-Hi, girls.
-Oh, hi, Rose.

02:09.867 --> 02:12.967
What are you doing with that heavy coat on
inside the house?

02:16.900 --> 02:18.300
You tell me, Rose!

02:19.433 --> 02:20.900
Ma!

02:21.300 --> 02:25.033
Dorothy, was Sophia naked just now,
or does her dress really need ironing?

02:32.433 --> 02:35.266
Hello, girls. Dorothy, Rose,
you all remember Laszlo?

02:35.333 --> 02:38.867
Of course.
Laszlo, the artist from your museum.

02:38.934 --> 02:42.300
Oh, we really enjoyed your lecture
on modern sculpture.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.567
I didn't think anyone
was paying attention.

02:44.633 --> 02:49.033
We were. Especially Dorothy.
She even considered taking up sculpting.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.700
-Really, Dorothy?
-Oh, no, I didn't.

02:51.767 --> 02:55.300
You said you'd
like to help him mold his clay

02:55.367 --> 02:57.200
or buff his marble anytime.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.834
Ah, ha, ha, ha. Rose,
you're such a kidder.

03:08.633 --> 03:11.400
He is gorgeous, isn't he, girls?

03:11.467 --> 03:14.934
All the women at the museum are after him.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.967
Women think because you're an artist,
you must also be a great lover.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.667
(laughs)

03:22.734 --> 03:24.900
They think because
you're a master in the studio,

03:24.967 --> 03:27.200
you must also be a master in the bedroom.

03:27.266 --> 03:29.767
(laughs)

03:29.834 --> 03:33.233
They think because
you can work clay into beautiful art,

03:33.300 --> 03:37.700
you can also work a woman's body
into fits of ecstasy and passion

03:37.767 --> 03:40.633
and total screaming abandon.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.367
(laughs)

03:48.934 --> 03:51.400
Would anybody else
like something cold to drink?

03:52.800 --> 03:53.800
-I would.
-I would.

03:54.333 --> 03:58.100
-Blanche, I should be going.
-Thank you again for the ride home.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.967
It was my pleasure.
Goodbye, Blanche.

04:01.433 --> 04:02.867
Goodbye, Dorothy.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.867
Goodbye, Rose.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.000
Goodbye, Blanche, again.

04:08.967 --> 04:10.967
It was my pleasure, ladies. Goodbye.

04:11.266 --> 04:14.000
-Laszlo, I'll see you tomorrow.
-Indeed.

04:17.233 --> 04:21.400
That sure sounded
as if you and Laszlo have something going.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.166
Maybe.

04:23.233 --> 04:27.000
-You're not telling us?
-All right, you twisted my arm.

04:27.066 --> 04:30.734
Laszlo's asked me
to pose for one of his sculptures.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
You're kidding.

04:31.867 --> 04:37.800
No. He gave me the key to his building.
My first session is tomorrow morning.

04:37.867 --> 04:38.867
Wow.

04:38.934 --> 04:42.300
He wants to do a piece
on the mature woman.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.300
He thinks I'm perfect for it.

04:44.367 --> 04:49.033
He's having it displayed
at his big museum show.

04:49.100 --> 04:52.567
I can't believe you're
going through with this.

04:52.633 --> 04:57.166
Why, of course I am.
Laszlo is a world-famous sculptor.

04:57.467 --> 05:02.600
This is my opportunity to be immortalized
forever in a classic work of art.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.867
That's exactly what she said

05:05.934 --> 05:08.033
when that shoe salesman
took Polaroid's of her

05:08.100 --> 05:09.500
in the back seat of his Volare.

05:10.734 --> 05:15.667
(serene music playing)

05:21.200 --> 05:23.567
-Good morning, Ma.
-Good morning, pussycat.

05:23.633 --> 05:25.266
I just poured you a nice glass
of orange juice.

05:25.333 --> 05:29.867
-Thank you, it was very nice of you.
-(laughs)

05:29.934 --> 05:32.133
Ma, is this a dribble glass?

05:32.200 --> 05:36.233
Yeah, it works better when all that pulp
doesn't clog up the dribble holes.

05:37.567 --> 05:40.900
-Ma, why did you do this?
-Maury Hazeltine.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.967
He won't quit with the practical jokes.

05:43.033 --> 05:45.233
I decided I'm gonna give him
a taste of his own medicine.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.967
-Do I look like Maury Hazeltine?
-A little around the eyebrows.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.266
But that's not the point.

05:51.533 --> 05:55.467
I gotta make sure I have the perfect gag
before I spring it on him.

05:56.567 --> 06:00.500
Ah, I'm sorry, pussycat.
No hard feelings?

06:00.567 --> 06:03.100
Oh, okay, Ma, no hard feelings.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.233
-(buzz)
-Ow.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.166
(laughs)

06:07.834 --> 06:10.433
You know, I could really get
tired of this.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.400
Good morning, girls.
Dorothy, you're a mess.

06:14.467 --> 06:18.100
-I just spilled orange juice on myself.
-Oh, really, I didn't notice that.

06:21.233 --> 06:25.734
-Ma, pour Blanche some orange juice.
-Yeah, I could use some of that,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.500
I think I might be coming down
with a cold.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.233
Well, it doesn't come as a surprise.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.300
I mean, you've spent every
afternoon this week

06:31.367 --> 06:34.533
standing stark naked
in a cold windy studio.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.800
Oh, I didn't catch a cold
at Laszlo's studio, Dorothy.

06:37.867 --> 06:40.367
Laszlo keeps me too warm for that.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.567
Too warm and too tingly.

06:42.934 --> 06:45.066
Warm and too tingly and too hot.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.600
Well, have some juice anyway,
Blanche, I'd feel better.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.633
Not that we actually do anything.

06:53.467 --> 06:57.100
In the studio.
Laszlo's been a perfect gentleman so far.

06:58.066 --> 07:02.266
I just stand there in front of
him in all my luscious nakedness.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.266
And somehow he manages to
suppress the urge

07:05.333 --> 07:07.333
to throw me on the floor and ravish me.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.867
Please, if he throws you on the floor,
you'll both end up in the apartment below.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.300
Drink up, Blanche.

07:16.367 --> 07:17.934
(doorbell rings)

07:18.800 --> 07:21.934
That must be him now.
I just have get my jacket.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.867
We're driving into the museum together.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.400
(laughs)

07:36.934 --> 07:38.300
Coming, Laszlo.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.300
Come in. Blanche just went to get a
jacket.

07:44.367 --> 07:45.500
Thank you.

07:45.567 --> 07:48.667
We're so excited
about what you two are doing.

07:48.734 --> 07:52.233
-I'm sure it'll turn out great.
-I wish I was so sure.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.166
-What do you mean?
-I'm having second thoughts.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.433
-About what?
-When I met Blanche,

07:56.500 --> 07:59.867
I thought she would be the perfect model.

07:59.934 --> 08:02.300
You know, sexy, sassy, exciting.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.533
But now I'm thinking there are other
qualities I wish to capture.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.533
-Like what?
-Innocence. Wholesomeness.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.400
Naiveté.

08:12.934 --> 08:17.834
I see a woman with a fuller figure,
wider hips, wider eyes.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.033
Rose...

08:26.133 --> 08:27.133
Laszlo.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.500
-I have to ask you something.
-I know what it is.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.400
You want me to pose too.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.467
-No.
-Oh.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.734
-Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
-That's it!

08:40.000 --> 08:42.367
That's exactly
the quality I want to capture.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.433
Take my key, Rose. Come to my studio.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.600
We'll make a beautiful sculpture together.

08:47.667 --> 08:50.266
-What about Blanche?
-I'll still see her.

08:50.567 --> 08:53.533
She doesn't have to know.
Tomorrow morning at 10?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.633
That seems so dishonest.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.166
Blanche is a dear friend.
I'd be betraying her.

08:58.233 --> 09:01.400
Here I am, Laszlo.
Did Rose keep you entertained?

09:01.467 --> 09:06.467
-Yes. She's charming.
-Laszlo, that's what I love about you.

09:06.533 --> 09:09.600
You can tell a bald-faced lie
and still sound sincere.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.900
I forgot my compact.

09:15.066 --> 09:16.500
Give me that key.

09:25.667 --> 09:29.800
I'm glad you're home.
I was upstairs in the attic.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.000
Look what I found.

09:31.066 --> 09:34.467
Your grandmother's antique kaleidoscope.
Here. Take a look.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.367
You must really think I'm stupid.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.800
What, we don't have an attic?

09:40.367 --> 09:42.166
I'm not falling for this.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.200
It's another practical joke.

09:44.266 --> 09:48.066
If I look through that,
I'll get charcoal all around my eye.

09:48.133 --> 09:53.867
Fine. Why don't we just call a truce
with some nice peanut brittle?

09:55.066 --> 09:56.633
Come on, Ma.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.233
The peanut brittle is an even older gag
than the kaleidoscope.

10:00.567 --> 10:05.066
I'll open the can, snakes will come out.
I'm too smart for you.

10:05.133 --> 10:07.934
I'm not falling for any more
practical jokes.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.800
-(rude noise)
-(Sophia laughs)

10:23.400 --> 10:25.767
Except for this whoopee cushion.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.133
Well, you won't believe
what happened to me today.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.166
-I don't believe it myself.
-What, Blanche?

10:42.233 --> 10:43.500
I don't want to talk about it.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.867
-Hi, Blanche.
-I am so mad!

10:46.934 --> 10:48.300
Blanche, I can explain.

10:48.367 --> 10:51.500
Explain? It's got nothing to do with you.
It's Laszlo.

10:51.967 --> 10:54.300
I just saw his sketches of me.

10:54.367 --> 10:58.166
He never lets me see them,
so I looked through his things.

10:58.233 --> 10:59.767
They're horrible!

10:59.834 --> 11:03.300
The hair's all big and frizzy.
The body's all droopy and saggy.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.734
The woman in those sketches
is a dog!

11:12.300 --> 11:13.800
-Blanche--
-She's a clown.

11:13.867 --> 11:17.734
-Blanche.
-She's just a hideous wrinkled, old bag!

11:18.333 --> 11:21.100
Blanche, the woman
in those sketches is me.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.934
I know she sounds
like you, honey, but she's not.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.633
Yes, she is. Look.

11:29.333 --> 11:34.533
I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.
I've been posing for Laszlo too.

11:34.600 --> 11:39.400
Dear lord, strike me dead
if that man prefers Rose Nylund over me.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.166
Don't take it personally.

11:42.233 --> 11:45.834
Laszlo just decided he wanted someone
with more... innocence.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.133
With more cellulite is more like it.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.433
-Take that back!
-No!

11:51.500 --> 11:53.367
-You will!
-I won't!

11:53.433 --> 11:56.266
-What is going on here?
-Nothing.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.567
-Rose just stabbing me in the back.
-I did not.

11:58.633 --> 12:01.433
-She posed for Laszlo.
-He asked me to!

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
I don't know why.
He can go to sea world

12:03.567 --> 12:05.133
if he wanted to see a naked whale.

12:09.367 --> 12:12.300
-Or to your bathtub.
-Oh.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.233
That does it, missy.
This means war.

12:16.700 --> 12:17.734
We'll both keep going.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.400
We'll see who he picks
for his sculpture.

12:19.467 --> 12:22.066
-It's going to be me.
-No, me.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.100
I can settle this.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.800
-All right, tell her who it's going to be.
-It's going to be me.

12:35.700 --> 12:39.900
(calm music playing)

12:39.967 --> 12:42.667
-You, too?
-He asked me Thursday.

12:42.734 --> 12:46.333
-Well, I am stunned.
-I'm relieved.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.367
Relieved?

12:49.867 --> 12:52.467
Sure. The woman you saw
in those horrible drawings

12:52.533 --> 12:54.066
must have been Dorothy.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.433
This is the worst day in my life.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.467
Two of my friends stab me in the back.

13:04.533 --> 13:08.166
Did you expect us to turn Laszlo down?

13:08.233 --> 13:11.300
You said it was a chance
to become immortalized

13:11.367 --> 13:14.300
-in a classic work of art.
-Horse pucker.

13:15.834 --> 13:19.133
You went for the same reason Rose went,
to get your hands on my man.

13:24.033 --> 13:26.633
Blanche, what exactly makes
you think he's your man?

13:26.700 --> 13:29.433
-Who?
-I found him first.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.900
-Who?
-He dumped you for me.

13:32.967 --> 13:35.934
-Who?
-Laszlo, Ma.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.400
-Who's Laszlo?
-A Hungarian artist

13:38.467 --> 13:40.400
we've all been posing nude for.

13:44.867 --> 13:48.500
In the future, a simple "none of your
business, Sophia" will suffice.

13:51.367 --> 13:54.433
Tell me honestly, Blanche,
do you have any reason to believe

13:54.500 --> 13:56.266
that Laszlo might be interested in you?

13:56.767 --> 13:59.967
Just that on numerous occasions
he has referred to me

14:00.033 --> 14:03.133
as his greatest artistic
inspiration ever, bar none.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.834
-Me too.
-Me too.

14:05.433 --> 14:10.333
Let's face it, girls. We have no idea
which of us Laszlo wants to use.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.300
I think it's obvious.
The man's an artist.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.867
He cannot help but pick the woman

14:15.934 --> 14:18.400
with the most grace, style
and femininity.

14:18.467 --> 14:19.567
(rude noise)

14:32.367 --> 14:34.900
I wonder if he knows which
of us he wants.

14:34.967 --> 14:38.433
He told me I had something
Blanche didn't.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.033
He probably told Dorothy the same
about me.

14:41.100 --> 14:45.533
-Maybe he's back to Blanche.
-I think he's been very unfair.

14:45.934 --> 14:48.900
We ought to all stop going.
Then he'd have no sculpture.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.567
-It would serve him right.
-Yes.

14:50.633 --> 14:54.467
Well, then, let's make a pact.
None of us will go back.

14:55.033 --> 14:57.266
Give me your keys.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.734
I'll keep all three safe in my hope chest.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.500
How do we know that you and your hope
chest won't keep going?

15:09.867 --> 15:14.734
There's only one thing to do,
make Laszlo decide who he wants.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.500
-Me, too.
-Fine with me.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.800
Then, let's go.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.433
-Where's everybody going?
-We'll be back in an hour.

15:22.500 --> 15:27.300
Why don't you sit here
and read your magazine?

15:27.367 --> 15:29.000
Oh, okay.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.467
Don't try outsmarting me.

15:36.533 --> 15:40.467
I've got the mind of a fox
and the butt muscles of Baryshnikov.

15:50.934 --> 15:52.734
(knock on door)

15:55.734 --> 15:56.800
Coming.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.700
Why, Blanche... hello.
Come in, come in.

16:01.767 --> 16:04.233
You've brought your friends
to see my studio.

16:04.300 --> 16:08.300
-What a pleasant surprise.
-Laszlo, we all know.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.200
We figured it out today.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.600
So, I'm caught at last.
What can I say?

16:13.667 --> 16:16.600
"Blanche and Rose, get out.
Dorothy, it's you I want."

16:17.700 --> 16:18.867
Dorothy.

16:18.934 --> 16:23.133
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'd never seen him in overalls before.

16:24.934 --> 16:29.200
Laszlo, you have to decide
which of us you want for your statue.

16:30.300 --> 16:33.767
-Rose...
-I knew it! Walk, suckers. He wants me.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.834
Rose, he just wanted to say
something to you.

16:36.900 --> 16:41.066
I wanted to say I'd rather not
decide at all.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.800
Oh, but Laszlo, you've got to.
It's the only way.

16:43.867 --> 16:46.867
Otherwise it'll just end up
coming between us three.

16:47.166 --> 16:51.266
Which one will it be,
Dorothy here, or Rose,

16:51.333 --> 16:54.800
or a woman whose breasts
you once described

16:54.867 --> 16:59.400
as perfect champagne glass-sized orbs
of dancing loveliness?

17:01.700 --> 17:03.300
Blanche, I did not say that.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.033
Well, you agreed when I said it.

17:06.767 --> 17:07.967
Ladies, let me explain.

17:08.033 --> 17:13.233
I know I should've chosen long ago,
but you each inspire me so well.

17:13.734 --> 17:18.900
I would continue seeing you all,
but I understand why that's unacceptable.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.734
-Therefore, my choice will have to be--
-Before you choose, let me say

17:23.800 --> 17:26.467
what a privilege it's been for me to work

17:26.533 --> 17:30.900
with the greatest Hungarian sculptor
of our time.

17:30.967 --> 17:36.767
And if Blanche can name
two other Hungarian sculptors of any time,

17:36.834 --> 17:38.433
I shall eat that statue.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.467
Laszlo, who do you choose?

17:43.533 --> 17:45.734
-None of you.
-None of us?

17:45.800 --> 17:49.333
I have enough sketches
to make my sculpture.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.100
When I'm ready to begin, I'll choose then.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.567
When will we know?

17:53.633 --> 17:56.166
Only when the work's
unveiled at my show.

17:56.233 --> 17:59.033
I apologize, but this is how I must work.

17:59.433 --> 18:02.033
Now, ladies, I must bid you good day.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.934
Oh, Laszlo, just one more thing.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.233
You know that famous Picasso painting,
<i>Nude Woman Playing The Violin?</i>

18:12.300 --> 18:14.834
-Of course.
-Well, originally it was called

18:14.900 --> 18:16.567
<i>Blanche playing the violin.</i>

18:17.667 --> 18:19.533
Only it wasn't a violin.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.333
Think about that the next time
you're standing around

18:22.400 --> 18:24.100
with your chisel in your hand.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
(Blanche) Oh.

18:36.233 --> 18:39.033
Oh, my God, Dorothy. There it is.
The statue.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.700
Oh, this is so exciting.

18:41.767 --> 18:46.700
I can't wait to hear that crowd gasp
when they lift the sheet and see me.

18:46.767 --> 18:50.000
I'd think you'd be used to that by now.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.867
-Hi, girls. Some party, isn't it?
-Why are you so cheerful?

18:56.934 --> 18:58.200
Why shouldn't I be?

18:58.266 --> 19:02.100
Well, any minute now,
this entire room could be looking

19:02.166 --> 19:05.233
at a statue of your nude body.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.000
Nude? The statue's going to be nude?

19:11.066 --> 19:15.734
-Did you think he'd put it in a poncho?
-Oh, my God!

19:16.500 --> 19:20.700
Hey, Dorothy, can you believe it?
10 grand for this piece of junk.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.233
-(smashes)
-Oh.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.567
Oh, Ma!

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Ha! You fell for it!

19:29.734 --> 19:31.367
This stuff kills me.

19:32.467 --> 19:36.667
Ma'am, you'll have to come with me.
You just smashed a priceless Lichtenfine.

19:37.300 --> 19:42.033
-I must've mixed them up.
-Ma, when will you learn to stop

19:42.100 --> 19:44.166
with these ridiculous practical jokes?

19:44.233 --> 19:46.500
I can't believe it. She fell for it again.

19:49.033 --> 19:51.400
You ought to have
"yutz" tattooed on your forehead.

19:52.533 --> 19:55.767
Here you go.
You were brilliant, Harry.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.433
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.300
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.400
The unveiling of the latest masterpiece
of Mr. Laszlo Grigorian.

20:13.033 --> 20:15.767
So, without further ado,
off with the sheet.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.467
(audience clapping)

20:20.533 --> 20:21.734
Oh!

20:22.967 --> 20:24.166
Oh!

20:25.400 --> 20:27.600
My God, I look gorgeous.

20:28.967 --> 20:32.867
-You? Blanche, that's me.
-The hell it is.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.934
-Girls, be serious. Look at those eyes.
-The nose.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.333
Look at the butt.

20:41.567 --> 20:45.433
-Sophia, you can't see the butt.
-Then it sure can't be you.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.600
There's only one way to settle this.
Where's Laszlo?

20:51.066 --> 20:52.100
There he is. Laszlo.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.500
Laszlo.

20:53.834 --> 20:58.333
What a simply stunning
piece of art this is.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.567
-Thank you.
-Now, who is it?

21:00.834 --> 21:02.200
It's not obvious?

21:02.266 --> 21:03.834
-Not to them.
-Not to them.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.867
I see I must explain.

21:06.934 --> 21:10.467
In this statue, I wanted to convey
strength and character

21:10.533 --> 21:12.800
-so I chose Dorothy.
-I knew it!

21:13.066 --> 21:16.066
-Then I dropped her.
-Like so many before you.

21:18.066 --> 21:21.600
I decided I needed
more sensuality and vitality,

21:21.667 --> 21:25.233
-so I turned to my sketches of Blanche.
-I knew it.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.567
Then I put them away.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.000
I wanted more softness,
more sweetness.

21:30.633 --> 21:35.066
-So I went to my sketches of Rose.
-You mean that's me up there?

21:35.133 --> 21:37.367
-No.
-Then who is it?

21:37.433 --> 21:39.600
It is all of you.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.700
The answer finally came to me.

21:45.066 --> 21:47.667
Why not take the best features
of each lady

21:47.734 --> 21:50.467
to create one perfect lady.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.233
That is what you see.

21:52.967 --> 21:56.433
You know, it is not hard to understand
why you are such good friends.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.567
You complement each other
very well indeed.

21:59.633 --> 22:00.767
(all) Oh...

22:00.834 --> 22:04.166
-Thank you, Laszlo.
-One more thing, Laszlo.

22:04.233 --> 22:06.400
I'd like to ask you a question.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.500
By any chance,
is there anybody here tonight...

22:09.967 --> 22:12.967
in whom you might be interested
romantically?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.567
Well, uh...

22:15.333 --> 22:16.967
as a matter of fact, yes.

22:17.033 --> 22:19.667
(Dorothy, Blanche and Rose)
It's me. I knew it. I knew it.

22:19.734 --> 22:20.867
Laszlo...

22:21.800 --> 22:23.233
looks like we're a hit.

22:33.133 --> 22:34.600
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.066
How can you blame him?
He looked at you three naked for a month.

22:46.500 --> 22:52.567
(serene music playing)

22:57.934 --> 22:59.033
Good morning.

22:59.533 --> 23:02.533
Dorothy, my practical
joking days are over.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.400
Ma, that is wonderful.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.834
-Sit down and have some juice with me.
-Okay, I will.

23:09.266 --> 23:12.767
You wouldn't be
playing a joke with this glass?

23:12.834 --> 23:14.934
Of course not.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.033
Because I know how much fun you have
playing practical jokes.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.233
I told you it's over. Drink your juice.

23:21.300 --> 23:25.934
Ma, did you leave something burning
on the stove?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.133
What? I don't think so.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.600
It was nothing. Well, bottoms up.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Don't ever change, pussycat.

23:59.266 --> 24:05.934
(theme music playing)
