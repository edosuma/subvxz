WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:02.970
>> RUXIN: Shiva Komedi

00:02.970 --> 00:05.038
Somakanakram!

00:05.038 --> 00:07.074
It feels good to be back.

00:07.074 --> 00:07.674
>> PETE: Oh, God.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.675
>> But maybe I won't win.

00:08.675 --> 00:09.576
I mean, who am I playing in the

00:09.576 --> 00:10.577
Shiva Bowl this year?

00:10.577 --> 00:12.012
We've known him as Tefl-Andre,

00:12.012 --> 00:12.980
because nothing sticks to him,

00:12.980 --> 00:14.147
but you know what is going to

00:14.147 --> 00:15.148
stick to him?

00:15.148 --> 00:17.684
The ropes and ropes of yogurt

00:17.684 --> 00:19.086
that I will cover his face with.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.088
(groaning)

00:21.088 --> 00:22.055
Andre is going to walk away from

00:22.055 --> 00:24.157
this Shiva Bowl loss looking

00:24.157 --> 00:26.260
like he got in an accident at a

00:26.260 --> 00:27.594
custard factory.

00:27.594 --> 00:28.595
>> KEVIN: Unnecessary.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.098
>> And so, the terrible reign of

00:31.098 --> 00:33.567
Ruxin begins anew!

00:33.567 --> 00:35.168
(cackling)

00:35.168 --> 00:37.204
>> What are you doing?

00:37.204 --> 00:38.238
Oh.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.406
Is this that stupid league of

00:39.406 --> 00:40.641
yours again?

00:40.641 --> 00:41.642
(laughter)

00:41.642 --> 00:43.043
>> Yeah, I'm just making a video

00:43.043 --> 00:44.044
because I'm in the finals.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
>> Ooh.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.079
What do you want, a trophy?

00:46.079 --> 00:47.014
>> We do have a trophy.

00:47.014 --> 00:47.514
It's the Shiva.

00:47.514 --> 00:48.482
It's this Indian girl that we

00:48.482 --> 00:49.216
went to high school...

00:49.216 --> 00:49.983
>> Who cares?!

00:49.983 --> 00:50.984
It's an eight-team league full

00:50.984 --> 00:51.985
of morons.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.053
Congratulations.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.054
You're king of the dipshits.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.055
Get back to work.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.056
>> Yeah, I just got to...

00:56.056 --> 00:58.058
>> Get back to work!

01:00.227 --> 01:01.595
>> (whispering): I'm gonna be

01:01.595 --> 01:02.262
the champion.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.330
>> Work!

01:03.330 --> 01:05.332
>> I'm the champion.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.704
>> Seriously, you're gonna hang

01:10.704 --> 01:11.638
that right there?

01:11.638 --> 01:12.639
>> JENNY: Yeah, don't worry.

01:12.639 --> 01:13.974
I got one for you, too.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.642
And sadly, it might be just as

01:15.642 --> 01:17.144
appropriate next year.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.211
>> Well, 'tis the season for an

01:18.211 --> 01:19.413
all-MacArthur Sacko Bowl.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.048
>> No, no, no, don't look at me.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.215
It's all right here.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.417
>> I cannot believe that I'm in

01:23.417 --> 01:24.585
the Sacko again.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.719
>> TACO: Yeah, my strategy

01:25.719 --> 01:26.720
didn't work too well, either.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.155
>> You mean not changing your

01:28.155 --> 01:29.122
lineup from the beginning of the

01:29.122 --> 01:30.257
season regardless of byes,

01:30.257 --> 01:31.491
match-ups or injuries?

01:31.491 --> 01:34.227
(phones chirping)

01:34.227 --> 01:35.596
>> An e-mail from the estate of

01:35.596 --> 01:37.097
Ted Rappaport?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.131
>> Oh, shit. Here, pull it up.

01:38.131 --> 01:39.566
>> Hello, my name is Fredrick

01:39.566 --> 01:40.734
Mandino, and I represent the

01:40.734 --> 01:41.969
estate of the late

01:41.969 --> 01:43.070
Theodore Rappaport.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.071
Mr. Rappaport left his Laguna

01:44.071 --> 01:45.472
Beach house to the winner of

01:45.472 --> 01:46.640
your fantasy football league,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.408
and as your Shiva Bowl has

01:48.408 --> 01:50.410
arrived, he wanted you to see

01:50.410 --> 01:51.411
what you were playing for.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.980
>> ALL: Whoa!

01:52.980 --> 01:54.047
>> Oh, my God.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.248
>> I would leave my family for

01:55.248 --> 01:56.249
that house.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.985
>> I would take your family for

01:57.985 --> 01:59.119
that house.

01:59.119 --> 01:59.987
>> I have also sent you some

01:59.987 --> 02:01.154
plane tickets, as Mr. Rappaport

02:01.154 --> 02:02.356
felt that since you were playing

02:02.356 --> 02:03.523
for the house, you should be

02:03.523 --> 02:04.524
staying at the house.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.659
>> What?!

02:05.659 --> 02:06.660
>> Holy shit, we're all flying

02:06.660 --> 02:07.461
to California.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.362
>> Hold on, I have to check my

02:08.362 --> 02:09.363
calendar.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.364
>> Mr. Rappaport then instructed

02:10.364 --> 02:11.465
me to make a series of very

02:11.465 --> 02:13.066
obscene gestures which, for

02:13.066 --> 02:14.067
professional reasons and some

02:14.067 --> 02:15.969
personal reasons, I would prefer

02:15.969 --> 02:17.204
not to do over electronic media.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.438
>> Looks like we are going on a

02:18.438 --> 02:20.674
Shiva Bowl road trip!

02:20.674 --> 02:22.676
>> Yeah, I'm free.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.019
>> ANDRE: F-First class?

02:32.019 --> 02:33.186
>> Yeah, I used my miles from

02:33.186 --> 02:34.187
Korea to upgrade.

02:34.187 --> 02:35.188
>> Hey, can I use your bathroom?

02:35.188 --> 02:36.189
>> If you use our bathroom, I

02:36.189 --> 02:38.191
got to call the air marshal.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.463
>> Thank you.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.100
>> Thank you.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.268
>> I'm good.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.336
>> Wasn't it so thoughtful of

02:49.336 --> 02:51.138
Ted to get Shiva her own seat?

02:51.138 --> 02:52.539
>> Can I have Shiva's peanuts?

02:52.539 --> 02:53.473
>> No!

02:53.473 --> 02:54.341
>> Andre, what are you doing

02:54.341 --> 02:55.042
in coach?

02:55.042 --> 02:56.043
You always fly first class.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.044
>> Well, after the debacle at

02:57.044 --> 02:58.111
Ménage à Cinq, money's been a

02:58.111 --> 02:59.112
little bit tight.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.113
So I figured I'd fly coach.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.114
It's not that bad at all.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.115
I mean, what, do I get the

03:02.115 --> 03:02.983
champagne in the back?

03:02.983 --> 03:03.417
>> Yeah.

03:03.417 --> 03:07.354
>> Okay, sounds great.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.722
>> All right, let's get onboard

03:08.722 --> 03:09.723
here. Who do we want to

03:09.723 --> 03:10.691
win this beach house?

03:10.691 --> 03:11.625
>> ALL: Andre.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.526
>> Yeah, I feel that.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.593
If Ruxin wins, it'll be nicer,

03:13.593 --> 03:14.761
but we won't have access.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.029
If Andre wins, it'll be super

03:16.029 --> 03:17.064
douchey, but we can do whatever

03:17.064 --> 03:18.065
we want with it.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.199
>> And if I win, I'll let you

03:19.199 --> 03:20.267
guys use it sometimes.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.169
>> You can't. You're out.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.170
>> Well, I'm not giving up,

03:23.170 --> 03:24.171
guys.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.172
>> You are mathematically

03:25.172 --> 03:26.106
eliminated.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.140
>> And if I do win, I'm gonna

03:27.140 --> 03:28.208
open a second location in Laguna

03:28.208 --> 03:31.178
Beach, the EBDBBnB LB.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.080
>> That's the spirit, Taco.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.548
>> Why is anyone pretending this

03:34.548 --> 03:37.050
is a back massager?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.051
>> Hello, sir. Can I get

03:38.051 --> 03:39.186
you a meal order tonight?

03:39.186 --> 03:40.187
>> Yes, please.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.188
Can I have the chicken piccata?

03:41.188 --> 03:42.189
>> I'm so sorry.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.256
We just gave the last one away.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.124
>> The salmon's delicious,

03:44.124 --> 03:45.092
though.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.093
It has a pink peppercorn sauce.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.094
>> I'll just have the chicken

03:47.094 --> 03:47.728
piccata, please.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.528
>> I'm so sorry.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.529
We just don't have enough for

03:49.529 --> 03:50.363
everyone to have their first

03:50.363 --> 03:51.198
choice.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.032
>> What about the pilots?

03:52.032 --> 03:53.066
Are they just gonna be given

03:53.066 --> 03:54.034
soda and imitation Chex Mix?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.102
>> No, of course they get a

03:55.102 --> 03:56.103
meal.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.104
>> And they're both having the

03:57.104 --> 03:58.171
salmon?

03:58.171 --> 03:59.172
>> Um, no.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.173
One is and the other...

04:00.173 --> 04:01.241
>> Is having the piccata?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.242
Well, so I'm gonna go talk to

04:02.242 --> 04:03.143
the pilot and see if he'll

04:03.143 --> 04:04.010
switch with me.

04:04.010 --> 04:04.678
>> Oh, sir, no, you can't.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.012
The seat belt sign is on, and

04:06.012 --> 04:07.013
besides, he's very busy.

04:07.013 --> 04:07.647
He's flying the plane.

04:07.647 --> 04:08.615
>> That's right, he is flying

04:08.615 --> 04:09.249
the plane.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.250
So he doesn't want to be

04:10.250 --> 04:11.284
concentrating on something as

04:11.284 --> 04:12.252
silly as what he's eating for

04:12.252 --> 04:13.286
dinner.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.287
>> No, I guess not.

04:14.287 --> 04:15.155
>> So maybe in this particular

04:15.155 --> 04:16.089
case, he's gonna have the

04:16.089 --> 04:17.324
salmon?

04:17.324 --> 04:18.592
>> What do I tell him?

04:18.592 --> 04:19.626
>> I would just tell him, "I'm

04:19.626 --> 04:20.694
sorry, but we don't have enough

04:20.694 --> 04:21.695
for everybody to get their first

04:21.695 --> 04:22.763
choice."

04:22.763 --> 04:23.597
>> Okay.

04:23.597 --> 04:27.234
>> Thank you.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.069
>> Now, that was impressive.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.403
>> Oh, that was nothing.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.605
>> Can I ask what you do?

04:31.605 --> 04:32.672
>> I'm a corporate lawyer, but

04:32.672 --> 04:34.141
I'm getting a little tired of

04:34.141 --> 04:35.108
being a concierge of evil.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.276
>> Well, maybe I can help.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.078
I'm Tom Condon.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.046
>> Tom Condon, super agent,

04:40.046 --> 04:41.014
Tom Condon?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.182
Represents Drew Brees,

04:42.182 --> 04:43.984
Eli Manning and Peyton Manning,

04:43.984 --> 04:45.051
Tom Condon?

04:45.051 --> 04:46.052
>> You know, we're always

04:46.052 --> 04:47.053
looking out for new talent, and

04:47.053 --> 04:48.121
if you can negotiate with teams

04:48.121 --> 04:50.056
the way you did with that flight

04:50.056 --> 04:51.424
attendant, we may have something

04:51.424 --> 04:52.492
to talk about.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.627
As a matter of fact, why don't

04:53.627 --> 04:54.761
you stop by my office while

04:54.761 --> 04:55.996
you're on the coast.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.131
>> Yeah, okay, sure.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.599
>> Psst, Ruxin.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.101
>> Get out of here, you flight

05:01.101 --> 05:01.960
urchin.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.402
>> Ruxin.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.236
>> Take a cookie, go.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.238
>> Ooh!

05:18.985 --> 05:20.420
>> Oh, God, it's right on the

05:20.420 --> 05:21.421
beach.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.656
>> Well, welcome, everyone.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.424
Glad to have you here, if only

05:24.424 --> 05:25.492
to fulfill the wishes of a great

05:25.492 --> 05:26.726
man, Mr. Theodore Rappaport.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.061
And he left specific

05:28.061 --> 05:29.396
instructions that I be here for

05:29.396 --> 05:30.730
the weekend to monitor the Shiva

05:30.730 --> 05:32.132
Bowl to make sure that no funny

05:32.132 --> 05:33.033
business occurs.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.234
>> Oh, I can assure you, as

05:34.234 --> 05:35.368
commissioner of this league,

05:35.368 --> 05:36.570
there has never been any funny

05:36.570 --> 05:37.571
business.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.572
>> There was a negotiation of a

05:38.572 --> 05:39.573
man's prison sentence as you

05:39.573 --> 05:40.574
exchanged number one draft

05:40.574 --> 05:41.575
picks?

05:41.575 --> 05:42.576
>> I plead the Fifth.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.010
>> Allegedly.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.111
>> You have abused the Make-A-

05:45.111 --> 05:46.213
Wish Foundation so that Josh

05:46.213 --> 05:48.315
Cribbs would help your team.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.316
>> You know, I have one thing to

05:49.316 --> 05:50.383
say to that.

05:50.383 --> 05:51.484
Cribbs!

05:51.484 --> 05:54.321
>> ALL: Cribbs!

05:54.321 --> 05:55.488
>> Crabs!

05:55.488 --> 05:56.723
>> Taco, you impersonated a

05:56.723 --> 05:58.058
notary public, ran a brothel and

05:58.058 --> 05:59.292
illegally imported and exported

05:59.292 --> 06:01.161
Three Penis wine.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.095
And, Kevin, I believe you

06:02.095 --> 06:03.096
ingested Mr. Rappaport's

06:03.096 --> 06:04.331
medicinal cocktail in order to

06:04.331 --> 06:05.665
gain a quote-unquote,

06:05.665 --> 06:07.467
"AIDS-vantage."

06:07.467 --> 06:10.070
Are there any more questions?

06:10.070 --> 06:12.239
>> May I use the restroom?

06:12.239 --> 06:13.373
>> Yes.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.375
>> Thank you.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.381
>> Hi, Kevin.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.616
(squeals)

06:22.616 --> 06:23.617
How do you like the place?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.018
>> Ted! Wait, no, you're, uh...

06:25.018 --> 06:26.019
>> Smarter than you.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.020
>> Uh...

06:27.020 --> 06:28.021
>> Better looking?

06:28.021 --> 06:28.655
>> No, you're...

06:28.655 --> 06:29.589
>> More money, more successful.

06:29.589 --> 06:30.991
>> No, you're dead. You're dead.

06:30.991 --> 06:31.658
>> Oh, correct.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.659
>> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:32.659 --> 06:33.660
No, no, no, no, this-this cannot

06:33.660 --> 06:34.461
be happening.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.495
>> But much like your low T and

06:35.495 --> 06:36.563
terrible fantasy lineup, here we

06:36.563 --> 06:37.430
are.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.665
>> If you really are a ghost,

06:38.665 --> 06:40.967
then I want a sign.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.235
>> Why does everybody feel like

06:42.235 --> 06:43.470
they have to make the dead guy

06:43.470 --> 06:45.005
jump through hoops?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.006
You're so tedious, man.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.007
Here.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.743
(car horn honking)

06:49.743 --> 06:51.144
Keep me a secret.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.279
I'll be back tonight.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.080
>> Okay.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.981
How much did you see in here?

06:54.981 --> 06:57.017
>> I came in at the scratching.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.218
>> That's okay.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.220
(honking continues)

07:02.555 --> 07:03.990
>> Whoa!

07:03.990 --> 07:05.025
(all groaning)

07:05.025 --> 07:06.059
This place is the tits!

07:06.059 --> 07:07.127
>> What the hell is he doing

07:07.127 --> 07:08.028
here?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.029
>> Mr. Rappaport's will

07:09.029 --> 07:10.030
stipulated that Rafi also be

07:10.030 --> 07:11.064
flown out.

07:11.064 --> 07:11.998
>> Oh, God, he's screwing us

07:11.998 --> 07:13.033
from beyond the grave.

07:13.033 --> 07:13.667
>> Hey, Brian!

07:13.667 --> 07:16.036
Put this in our room.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.071
(shouting)

07:18.071 --> 07:19.072
>> Where you going?

07:19.072 --> 07:20.307
(laughs)

07:20.307 --> 07:21.508
That dumb dildo left us his cab.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.609
>> Rafi, why did the bag make

07:22.609 --> 07:23.610
a squish?

07:23.610 --> 07:24.511
>> Oh, it's full of chicken

07:24.511 --> 07:25.445
livers.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.446
You mash them all together, and

07:26.446 --> 07:27.447
then you have sex with them.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.448
It mimics the consistency of a

07:28.448 --> 07:29.649
human vagina.

07:29.649 --> 07:30.684
I'm gonna be banging that bag

07:30.684 --> 07:32.018
all weekend, bro.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.988
Squish, squish, splurt.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.156
>> This is not the sign I was

07:36.156 --> 07:37.023
looking for.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.025
>> So you're really gonna take

07:39.025 --> 07:40.160
this meeting with Tom Condon?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.161
>> Yeah, I'm sick of working

07:41.161 --> 07:42.228
for that corn-fed monster

07:42.228 --> 07:43.530
Bethesda anymore, and I'm not

07:43.530 --> 07:44.531
going back to Korea.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.999
I win the league, get a new

07:45.999 --> 07:47.000
house, get a new job, new

07:47.000 --> 07:47.968
beginning.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.969
>> Yeah, are you gonna bring the

07:48.969 --> 07:50.003
whole family out?

07:50.003 --> 07:50.537
>> What's that now?

07:50.537 --> 07:51.638
>> Your family, Sofia, Geoffrey.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.672
Does she even know you're here

07:52.672 --> 07:53.673
with us?

07:53.673 --> 07:54.674
>> She knows that I'm on a work

07:54.674 --> 07:56.009
trip, which it now turns out,

07:56.009 --> 07:57.043
I am.

07:57.043 --> 07:57.677
>> Wow.

07:57.677 --> 07:58.678
>> So looking back, I've been

07:58.678 --> 08:00.080
very straightforward with her.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.614
>> Great sports agent.

08:01.614 --> 08:02.615
>> You guys notice anything

08:02.615 --> 08:03.683
weird about this house?

08:03.683 --> 08:04.985
>> I saw Rafi pissing in my

08:04.985 --> 08:06.252
chest of drawers, but that's not

08:06.252 --> 08:07.754
really out of the ordinary.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.522
>> Oh, Tall Guy, when am I gonna

08:09.522 --> 08:10.523
stop hearing about this?

08:10.523 --> 08:12.192
I told you, I'm afraid of new

08:12.192 --> 08:14.361
toilets, so I Goldilocksed all

08:14.361 --> 08:15.562
the new drawers in the house,

08:15.562 --> 08:17.030
and yours was just right.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.298
>> Anyone run across my brother

08:18.298 --> 08:19.299
at all today?

08:19.299 --> 08:20.300
>> Oh, you mean Tac Cousteau?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.267
Yeah, he's out fishing on the

08:21.267 --> 08:22.268
pier, trying to get us some

08:22.268 --> 08:23.269
dinner.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.337
>> What? I'll be back.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.338
>> Bye.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.339
>> I hope he catches the

08:26.339 --> 08:27.340
Little Mermaid, right?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.375
You ever seen anything as sexy

08:28.375 --> 08:29.242
as that?

08:29.242 --> 08:30.076
>> Well, when they have the

08:30.076 --> 08:31.077
tail, I'm not sure that you can

08:31.077 --> 08:32.078
do what you want to do there.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.079
>> Oh, they've got fish biz

08:33.079 --> 08:34.080
down there, okay?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.248
And all I want is to get

08:35.248 --> 08:37.050
involved with fish biz.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.051
(chuckles)

08:38.051 --> 08:39.586
>> All right.

08:39.586 --> 08:42.122
Oh, here comes Andre.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.990
>> Whew!

08:43.990 --> 08:44.424
>> Hey, Andre.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.058
>> Hey!

08:45.058 --> 08:46.126
>> Hey, hey, hey.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.060
>> We actually have something we

08:47.060 --> 08:47.627
want to talk to you about.

08:47.627 --> 08:48.595
>> All right, yeah, what do you

08:48.595 --> 08:49.229
got?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.263
>> I would like to offer you my

08:50.263 --> 08:51.398
personal advice on your fantasy

08:51.398 --> 08:52.399
lineup.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.433
>> Me, too.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.167
>> Really?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.268
>> But when you win, I get use

08:55.268 --> 08:56.569
of this beach house one month a

08:56.569 --> 08:57.737
year.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.005
>> I also get use for a month,

08:59.005 --> 09:00.006
and it has to be a summer month.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.007
>> Ooh, I want a summer month.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.142
>> Yeah, it's totally fine.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.143
I mean, there's plenty of room

09:03.143 --> 09:03.576
in there.

09:03.576 --> 09:04.577
You take the top, I'll take the

09:04.577 --> 09:05.345
bottom, whatever.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.346
>> Yeah, no, I was thinking you

09:06.346 --> 09:07.347
probably wouldn't be there.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.348
>> Yeah, more of a solo thing.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.349
>> Yeah.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.984
>> Okay, yes, yes.

09:10.984 --> 09:11.985
>> All right.

09:11.985 --> 09:12.619
>> I want your advice.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.753
>> Here you go.

09:13.753 --> 09:14.754
>> All right.

09:14.754 --> 09:15.755
(chuckles) I like that.

09:15.755 --> 09:16.489
>> Right?

09:16.489 --> 09:17.290
>> I like that.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.258
Of course I'm playing Antonio

09:18.258 --> 09:19.426
Gates as tight end.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.593
Pictures.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.628
Oh! Bikini shot, huh?

09:21.628 --> 09:22.629
>> What?

09:22.629 --> 09:23.630
>> Jenny bikini shot.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.631
>> Stop it, Andre.

09:24.631 --> 09:25.698
I was packing. Give it to me.

09:25.698 --> 09:26.766
You don't look through someone

09:26.766 --> 09:27.967
else's phone.

09:27.967 --> 09:28.968
>> You just handed it to me.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.003
>> It's like going through

09:30.003 --> 09:31.004
someone's medicine cabinet,

09:31.004 --> 09:31.638
Andre!

09:31.638 --> 09:32.639
>> I can look through people's

09:32.639 --> 09:33.673
medicine cabinets. I'm a doctor.

09:33.673 --> 09:34.741
>> No, you can't!

09:34.741 --> 09:35.742
>> Enough, enough.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.743
You guys, come here.

09:36.743 --> 09:37.977
Think about the match-ups.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.312
>> It's good, right?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.447
>> Oakland, I mean, come on.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.481
>> What if I...

09:41.481 --> 09:43.016
>> See this?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.017
>> Yeah, yeah, of course. Yes!

09:44.017 --> 09:45.151
>> Right?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.252
>> I smell collusion.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.587
>> I never would've...

09:47.587 --> 09:50.156
(sighs)

09:50.156 --> 09:52.592
>> Hey, Taco, we got to talk.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.693
>> Oh, hey, brother.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.361
>> I can't win the Sacko for two

09:55.361 --> 09:56.362
years in a row, okay?

09:56.362 --> 09:57.464
I can't be hammered like that

09:57.464 --> 09:58.465
again.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.632
>> Yeah, you definitely can't.

09:59.632 --> 10:00.633
That's gonna be bad.

10:00.633 --> 10:01.601
>> Well, that's why I need your

10:01.601 --> 10:02.602
help, all right? You got to...

10:02.602 --> 10:04.104
You got to take a dive.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.138
>> What do you mean, take a

10:05.138 --> 10:05.972
dive?

10:05.972 --> 10:07.107
>> I need you to lose on

10:07.107 --> 10:09.042
purpose.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.043
>> You need me to cheat.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.044
>> It's not really cheating,

10:11.044 --> 10:11.578
Taco.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.612
I mean, you don't even care

10:12.612 --> 10:13.613
about this league.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.614
>> I don't care about this

10:14.614 --> 10:16.082
league, but there's one thing I

10:16.082 --> 10:17.083
do care about.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.084
And that's you.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.085
You've never really done

10:19.085 --> 10:20.086
anything with your life.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.087
Your career isn't working,

10:21.087 --> 10:22.489
your marriage isn't working,

10:22.489 --> 10:23.756
and your dick's not even

10:23.756 --> 10:24.757
working.

10:24.757 --> 10:25.758
>> My dick is back to normal,

10:25.758 --> 10:26.659
okay?

10:26.659 --> 10:27.660
>> Oh, that is nothing to brag

10:27.660 --> 10:28.995
about.

10:28.995 --> 10:29.996
Part of this is my fault.

10:29.996 --> 10:30.663
>> What?

10:30.663 --> 10:31.764
>> I've been too easy on you.

10:31.764 --> 10:32.765
But no more.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.134
I am gonna try my very hardest

10:34.134 --> 10:35.568
to beat you this week.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.003
I am gonna make you work for

10:37.003 --> 10:38.004
this win.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.005
You need to toughen up, you

10:39.005 --> 10:40.006
little bitch!

10:40.006 --> 10:40.974
>> What?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.142
I-I'm a tough guy!

10:42.142 --> 10:43.476
I am!

10:43.476 --> 10:44.477
(scoffs)

10:44.477 --> 10:45.512
My God, why did I think this was

10:45.512 --> 10:46.513
gonna work?

10:46.513 --> 10:47.614
(growling)

10:47.614 --> 10:50.683
(screams)

10:50.683 --> 10:51.985
What the shit?!

10:51.985 --> 10:53.686
What are you doing, Taco?!

10:53.686 --> 10:55.188
>> I'm doing this because I love

10:55.188 --> 10:56.356
you, brother.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.590
And don't shit in the water,

10:57.590 --> 10:58.591
Seabiscuit.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.093
>> I'm not Seabiscuit!

11:00.093 --> 11:02.095
One snuck out on impact.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.364
>> Hi, Kevin.

11:10.364 --> 11:11.598
You look real stupid when you

11:11.598 --> 11:12.599
sleep.

11:12.599 --> 11:13.700
(gasps)

11:13.700 --> 11:14.434
>> Is this real?

11:14.434 --> 11:15.702
>> You guys make a nice couple.

11:15.702 --> 11:17.437
(groans)

11:17.437 --> 11:18.472
>> I need you to come with me.

11:18.472 --> 11:19.540
>> Up there?

11:19.540 --> 11:20.574
>> Up?

11:20.574 --> 11:22.676
Oh, buddy.

11:22.676 --> 11:23.677
>> Oh, no, no, no.

11:23.677 --> 11:24.878
I'm a good person.

11:24.878 --> 11:26.013
>> Okay. To the balcony.

11:26.013 --> 11:27.080
>> Oh.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.415
>> Yeah. Let's go.

11:28.415 --> 11:29.416
>> Okay.

11:29.416 --> 11:30.417
>> Just take a quick look at

11:30.417 --> 11:31.385
your wife.

11:31.385 --> 11:32.486
>> What? Hey, hey, hey, no!

11:32.486 --> 11:33.687
>> Relax, okay?

11:33.687 --> 11:34.922
I'm not gonna give her ghost

11:34.922 --> 11:35.923
AIDS.

11:35.923 --> 11:37.424
>> Ghost AIDS?

11:37.424 --> 11:39.393
You guys can't catch a break.

11:39.393 --> 11:40.694
>> So Taco's gonna go for it

11:40.694 --> 11:41.695
against you.

11:41.695 --> 11:42.829
He's got a good enough team.

11:42.829 --> 11:43.864
>> I don't want to be the Sacko.

11:43.864 --> 11:44.932
I don't, not two years in a row.

11:44.932 --> 11:46.433
>> I'm gonna help you win, but

11:46.433 --> 11:47.434
you got to do something for me.

11:47.434 --> 11:48.835
>> What can I do for you?

11:48.835 --> 11:50.404
>> I want one more prank on

11:50.404 --> 11:51.405
these guys.

11:51.405 --> 11:52.039
>> Why?

11:52.039 --> 11:53.340
>> Why? You drafted on my

11:53.340 --> 11:54.474
embalmed body, you knocked over

11:54.474 --> 11:55.576
the coffin, you had sex at my

11:55.576 --> 11:56.843
funeral.

11:56.843 --> 11:58.445
>> Nope, nobody had sex, because

11:58.445 --> 11:59.446
nobody came.

11:59.446 --> 12:00.747
>> Penetration is sex.

12:00.747 --> 12:02.115
>> No, I just put the tip in.

12:02.115 --> 12:03.116
>> Kevin, you're all tip.

12:03.116 --> 12:04.117
>> That's not cool, man.

12:04.117 --> 12:05.118
>> So you gonna do this for me

12:05.118 --> 12:05.752
or not?

12:05.752 --> 12:06.653
>> Yes, what do you want to do?

12:06.653 --> 12:07.654
>> I'm thinking something fun,

12:07.654 --> 12:08.655
and I'm just spit balling, but I

12:08.655 --> 12:09.523
heard Andre talking about his

12:09.523 --> 12:10.524
cat.

12:10.524 --> 12:11.792
>> Can't do that.

12:11.792 --> 12:12.793
We already did that one.

12:12.793 --> 12:13.827
You don't watch everything

12:13.827 --> 12:14.828
up there?

12:14.828 --> 12:15.963
>> I'm not gonna watch Andre.

12:15.963 --> 12:17.431
>> Oh. Hey, do you guys play

12:17.431 --> 12:18.498
fantasy football?

12:18.498 --> 12:19.499
>> I'm in a 14-team fantasy

12:19.499 --> 12:20.500
league with Gandhi and the

12:20.500 --> 12:21.602
Ultimate Warrior, yeah.

12:21.602 --> 12:22.502
>> No way.

12:22.502 --> 12:23.503
>> There's no bye-weeks.

12:23.503 --> 12:24.338
Your best players never get

12:24.338 --> 12:24.972
injured.

12:24.972 --> 12:25.739
>> Heaven.

12:25.739 --> 12:26.573
>> You're not going.

12:26.573 --> 12:27.474
Are you in or out?

12:27.474 --> 12:28.675
>> I'll do it, but I want to win

12:28.675 --> 12:30.410
first.

12:30.410 --> 12:31.678
>> I couldn't care less.

12:31.678 --> 12:32.679
>> Great. Pranks.

12:32.679 --> 12:33.914
We could...

12:33.914 --> 12:35.082
>> Brian?

12:35.082 --> 12:36.416
Hey! (chuckles)

12:36.416 --> 12:37.751
>> Hey.

12:37.751 --> 12:38.752
>> Oh, what are you doing out

12:38.752 --> 12:39.753
here, man?

12:39.753 --> 12:40.954
>> If you must know, I'm talking

12:40.954 --> 12:42.089
to Ted's ghost.

12:42.089 --> 12:43.123
>> I get that, man.

12:43.123 --> 12:44.124
I've been talking to a gremlin

12:44.124 --> 12:45.125
for an hour in my room.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.460
>> All right, well, anyway, Ted

12:46.460 --> 12:48.362
wanted me to pull a prank on

12:48.362 --> 12:49.463
everyone...

12:49.463 --> 12:50.464
>> I'm in. You had me at prank.

12:50.464 --> 12:51.465
>> You don't even know what

12:51.465 --> 12:52.366
we're gonna do.

12:52.366 --> 12:53.433
>> I don't care. I'm in.

12:53.433 --> 12:54.401
I want to do it with you.

12:54.401 --> 12:55.402
Prank bros.

12:55.402 --> 12:56.403
>> Okay, well, here's what I was

12:56.403 --> 12:57.404
thinking.

12:57.404 --> 12:58.338
We get everyone together in a

12:58.338 --> 12:59.339
group for a picture here, and

12:59.339 --> 13:00.407
then we get someone up here with

13:00.407 --> 13:01.041
a bucket...

13:01.041 --> 13:02.342
>> Oh, I'll be the bucket guy.

13:02.342 --> 13:03.343
>> You sure?

13:03.343 --> 13:04.411
>> Brian, look at me in my eyes.

13:04.411 --> 13:06.580
I will take care of this.

13:06.580 --> 13:07.681
>> Fine. I'm gonna go to bed.

13:07.681 --> 13:08.849
>> All right. Let's go.

13:08.849 --> 13:09.850
>> Great. No.

13:09.850 --> 13:10.851
>> Why?

13:10.851 --> 13:11.852
>> Just be by yourself.

13:11.852 --> 13:12.686
Enjoy the scenery.

13:12.686 --> 13:13.520
Okay, look.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.521
>> You know what? (groans)

13:14.521 --> 13:15.522
I'm probably gonna put my dick

13:15.522 --> 13:16.356
in this beach.

13:16.356 --> 13:17.357
>> All right, fine. Get crabs.

13:17.357 --> 13:18.358
>> (chuckles) Joke's on you.

13:18.358 --> 13:19.593
I'm gonna give this beach crabs.

14:50.951 --> 14:51.952
>> ALL: What?

14:51.952 --> 14:53.120
>> We were having a beautiful

14:53.120 --> 14:55.021
afternoon on the beach, sitting,

14:55.021 --> 14:57.124
enjoying the sun, and then this

14:57.124 --> 14:59.559
rogue wave just came and just

14:59.559 --> 15:01.728
crashed over us, and it pulled

15:01.728 --> 15:04.598
us out, and I swam and I swam.

15:04.598 --> 15:05.832
And then another wave came, and

15:05.832 --> 15:07.467
it knocked me down, and then I

15:07.467 --> 15:08.635
lost her.

15:08.635 --> 15:10.370
She's just out to sea.

15:10.370 --> 15:13.974
The sea has taken Shiva.

15:16.376 --> 15:17.377
I'm on the verge of winning, and

15:17.377 --> 15:18.378
you lose the Shiva.

15:18.378 --> 15:19.412
>> I'm sorry! It's terrible!

15:19.412 --> 15:20.413

15:20.413 --> 15:21.414

15:21.414 --> 15:22.048
>> It's okay, all right?

15:22.048 --> 15:23.049
I'll just go grab the Sacko,

15:23.049 --> 15:24.050
throw it in the ocean, start...

15:24.050 --> 15:24.885
>> No, no!

15:24.885 --> 15:25.519
>> No.

15:25.519 --> 15:26.520
>> Why?

15:26.520 --> 15:27.354
>> Oh, God, what are we gonna

15:27.354 --> 15:28.488
do?

15:28.488 --> 15:29.790
>> I guess the house is the new

15:29.790 --> 15:30.824
Shiva.

15:30.824 --> 15:31.625
>> Oh.

15:31.625 --> 15:32.459

15:35.495 --> 15:36.596
I'm fine!

15:36.596 --> 15:37.597
>> Oh, God! Oh!

15:37.597 --> 15:38.698
Oh, my God, is that alive?

15:38.698 --> 15:39.699
>> It's seaweed.

15:39.699 --> 15:41.768
>> Is it alive, though?

15:41.768 --> 15:43.370
>> You know, before we hire you,

15:43.370 --> 15:44.371
we want to see how you interact

15:44.371 --> 15:45.372
with the clients.

15:45.372 --> 15:46.439

15:51.945 --> 15:53.380

15:53.380 --> 15:54.347
>> Met before?

15:54.347 --> 15:56.349
>> You're an angry little man.

15:56.349 --> 15:57.450
>> Yeah, I'm about to get angry

15:57.450 --> 15:58.485
all up in your face.

15:58.485 --> 15:58.919
>> Yeah? Yeah?

15:58.919 --> 16:00.587
>> Yeah. Yeah!

16:00.587 --> 16:02.389
Nope, not that I recall.

16:02.389 --> 16:04.090
>> You look familiar.

16:04.090 --> 16:05.125
>> Yeah, I got one of those

16:05.125 --> 16:06.126
faces, but, um...

16:06.126 --> 16:07.394
>> You're good.

16:07.394 --> 16:08.628
Take a seat there, buddy.

16:08.628 --> 16:10.063
Tone, take it easy on him.

16:10.063 --> 16:11.431
We like this guy.

16:11.431 --> 16:12.432
>> No problem.

16:12.432 --> 16:13.333
>> You gonna come back real

16:13.333 --> 16:14.367
soon?

16:14.367 --> 16:15.402
>> You said your name was Ruxin?

16:15.402 --> 16:16.403
>> Well, everybody calls me

16:16.403 --> 16:17.404
Rodney.

16:17.404 --> 16:18.505
>> Yeah, but we've met.

16:18.505 --> 16:19.573
>> Hey, big game this week, huh,

16:19.573 --> 16:20.574
against the Niners?

16:20.574 --> 16:22.375
>> Big game, absolutely. Yeah.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.443
>> Yeah, it's a big week, and

16:23.443 --> 16:26.546
yet, you know, you got to save

16:26.546 --> 16:27.747
yourself for the playoffs.

16:27.747 --> 16:28.782
>> In this league, you can't do

16:28.782 --> 16:29.616
that.

16:29.616 --> 16:30.884
You got to kind of play it every

16:30.884 --> 16:32.018
week, every single week.

16:32.018 --> 16:33.019
'Cause you never know.

16:33.019 --> 16:34.020
>> Maybe...

16:34.020 --> 16:35.121
Maybe let the wide receivers get

16:35.121 --> 16:36.523
a TD or two.

16:36.523 --> 16:37.524
Like, throw Keenan Allen a bone.

16:37.524 --> 16:38.758
>> I've marked this on my

16:38.758 --> 16:39.759
calendar.

16:39.759 --> 16:40.760
I need to have a big week this

16:40.760 --> 16:41.795
week.

16:41.795 --> 16:42.796
>> Maybe next week.

16:42.796 --> 16:43.997
>> No, I got to play big this

16:43.997 --> 16:45.065
week.

16:45.065 --> 16:46.099
>> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:46.099 --> 16:47.100
>> Enough about me.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.368
Tell me something about you.

16:48.368 --> 16:49.402
You got a family?

16:49.402 --> 16:51.104
>> Yeah, I got a wife and kid.

16:51.104 --> 16:52.105
Kid's not bad.

16:52.105 --> 16:53.506
He's actually a pretty solid

16:53.506 --> 16:54.507
little athlete.

16:54.507 --> 16:55.508
Early developer, home run

16:55.508 --> 16:56.409
hitter.

16:56.409 --> 16:57.444
>> Cute kid, cute kid.

16:57.444 --> 16:58.612
>> He is a cute kid, yeah.

16:58.612 --> 16:59.613
It's really kind of bad

16:59.613 --> 17:00.680
etiquette to go through

17:00.680 --> 17:01.514
someone's phone.

17:01.514 --> 17:02.515
>> Oh, fantasy player, huh?

17:02.515 --> 17:03.516
>> What's that now?

17:03.516 --> 17:04.684
>> Ruxin Roll.

17:04.684 --> 17:06.353
Get your Rux off.

17:06.353 --> 17:07.487
>> Yeah, it's just pun stuff

17:07.487 --> 17:08.421
just to keep the mind nimble.

17:08.421 --> 17:10.690
>> Hm.

17:10.690 --> 17:11.858
I remember you.

17:11.858 --> 17:13.460
You're that angry little man

17:13.460 --> 17:14.427
that tried to throw a punch at

17:14.427 --> 17:15.428
me.

17:15.428 --> 17:16.463
>> (gasps) That's how I know

17:16.463 --> 17:17.464
you.

17:17.464 --> 17:18.465
>> You were mad at me because I

17:18.465 --> 17:19.466
dropped a 40 burger on your

17:19.466 --> 17:20.467
team.

17:20.467 --> 17:21.568
>> I'm a different guy now.

17:21.568 --> 17:22.602
I don't even play fantasy

17:22.602 --> 17:23.937
football anymore, so.

17:23.937 --> 17:25.672
>> So I guess, you know, you

17:25.672 --> 17:26.907
wouldn't mind if I started

17:26.907 --> 17:27.908
dropping a couple players, huh?

17:27.908 --> 17:29.509
It wouldn't bother you.

17:29.509 --> 17:30.644
>> Hm-mmm.

17:30.644 --> 17:31.811
>> Get rid of Drew Brees.

17:31.811 --> 17:32.812
>> Drew Brees.

17:32.812 --> 17:34.381
>> Get rid of Dez Bryant.

17:34.381 --> 17:35.916
>> Yeah, 'cause he's not having

17:35.916 --> 17:37.450
a big year at all.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.452
>> Yeah, Peyton Manning.

17:39.452 --> 17:40.353
>> If you were saying you were

17:40.353 --> 17:41.421
gonna get rid of Papa John's, I

17:41.421 --> 17:42.422
might stop you, but I don't

17:42.422 --> 17:43.456
care.

17:43.456 --> 17:44.457
>> Chris Johnson.

17:44.457 --> 17:45.458
>> You can actually get rid of

17:45.458 --> 17:46.459
Chris Johnson if you want.

17:46.459 --> 17:47.460
>> Get rid of Jamaal Charles,

17:47.460 --> 17:48.361
huh?

17:48.361 --> 17:49.029
Yeah, you don't need him.

17:49.029 --> 17:50.063
>> Yeah, I don't need him.

17:50.063 --> 17:50.664
>> Okay.

17:50.664 --> 17:51.631
>> Okay.

17:51.631 --> 17:52.699
>> Here we go.

17:52.699 --> 17:53.800
>> No! No!

17:53.800 --> 17:54.834
>> Drew Brees, gone.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.069
>> Not Drew!

17:56.069 --> 17:57.070
>> Tom Brady...

17:57.070 --> 17:58.371
>> Please don't do this to me.

17:58.371 --> 17:58.805
>> Gone.

17:58.805 --> 17:59.839
>> How can you hold me back with

17:59.839 --> 18:00.640
one arm?

18:00.640 --> 18:01.675
>> How's everything going in

18:01.675 --> 18:02.409
here, guy...

18:02.409 --> 18:03.376
>> Hey, what the hell is going

18:03.376 --> 18:04.411
on?

18:04.411 --> 18:05.378
>> Guys, this is exactly what it

18:05.378 --> 18:06.513
looks like.

18:06.513 --> 18:08.515
(sighs)

18:13.920 --> 18:15.488
>> Are you kidding me?

18:15.488 --> 18:17.023
Come on, it is beautiful

18:17.023 --> 18:19.492
outside, and you guys are just

18:19.492 --> 18:20.493
sitting here, glued to your

18:20.493 --> 18:21.661
computers.

18:21.661 --> 18:22.862
Let's go to the beach.

18:22.862 --> 18:23.863
>> No, I'm good.

18:23.863 --> 18:24.864
>> Leave us alone.

18:24.864 --> 18:26.333
>> (groans) God, you guys are

18:26.333 --> 18:27.334
like couch mushrooms.

18:27.334 --> 18:28.468
>> Taco, you should probably hit

18:28.468 --> 18:29.469
the beach with Jenny.

18:29.469 --> 18:30.470
>> No, I'm good, brother.

18:30.470 --> 18:31.705
Got to set the best lineup

18:31.705 --> 18:33.506
possible, because I love you.

18:33.506 --> 18:35.375
Okay, I'm gonna take Victor Cruz

18:35.375 --> 18:36.676
out, 'cause I just noticed he's

18:36.676 --> 18:37.711
injured.

18:37.711 --> 18:38.845
>> Victor Cruz has been injured

18:38.845 --> 18:39.846
since week six.

18:39.846 --> 18:40.847
>> Final poll.

18:40.847 --> 18:41.848
I need a D.

18:41.848 --> 18:43.450
Miami or the Titans v.

18:43.450 --> 18:44.384
Jacksonville?

18:44.384 --> 18:45.418
>> Miami.

18:45.418 --> 18:46.052
>> Ooh, good one.

18:46.052 --> 18:46.686
>> Titans.

18:46.686 --> 18:47.354
>> Good, good, good.

18:47.354 --> 18:48.021
>> Titans for sure.

18:48.021 --> 18:49.055
>> I don't take advice from

18:49.055 --> 18:50.056
Sackos.

18:50.056 --> 18:51.491
Ooh, hey, Rafi, got to pick a D.

18:51.491 --> 18:52.359
Trying to think, Miami or

18:52.359 --> 18:52.892
Titans?

18:52.892 --> 18:53.893
>> D? What, like a dick?

18:53.893 --> 18:54.661
>> Forget this.

18:54.661 --> 18:55.595
>> Which is the biggest dick?

18:55.595 --> 18:56.429
>> Don't worry about it.

18:56.429 --> 18:57.430
I'm gonna pick Miami. Miami.

18:57.430 --> 18:58.431
Thank you very much.

18:58.431 --> 18:59.432
>> Well, I can't believe this,

18:59.432 --> 19:00.400
but the games are about to

19:00.400 --> 19:01.334
start.

19:01.334 --> 19:02.435
I love this West Coast thing.

19:02.435 --> 19:03.069
>> I know, life begins

19:03.069 --> 19:03.903
at 10:00 a.m.

19:03.903 --> 19:05.071
>> All right, the Shiva Bowl

19:05.071 --> 19:06.406
Championship lineup has been

19:06.406 --> 19:07.407
set.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.408
Time for a beer to celebrate.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.477
>> Uh, you realize your winning

19:10.477 --> 19:11.544
lineup has yet to be saved?

19:11.544 --> 19:12.946
>> What's that?

19:12.946 --> 19:13.947
>> Well, you tinkered, you

19:13.947 --> 19:14.948
stinkered, but you forgot to

19:14.948 --> 19:15.949
press "set lineup."

19:15.949 --> 19:16.950
>> Oh, very funny.

19:16.950 --> 19:17.650
>> Oh, no joke.

19:17.650 --> 19:18.551
They're kicking off.

19:18.551 --> 19:19.552
>> What?! No!

19:19.552 --> 19:21.654
(laughter)

19:21.654 --> 19:23.356
>> Kickoff.

19:23.356 --> 19:24.391
>> I pressed it, I pressed it, I

19:24.391 --> 19:25.392
pressed it.

19:25.392 --> 19:26.593
No, I pressed "set lineup."

19:26.593 --> 19:27.627
>> No, I don't see it submitted,

19:27.627 --> 19:28.628
Ruxin.

19:28.628 --> 19:29.596
>> You pressed it too late.

19:29.596 --> 19:30.764
Lineups lock when the kickoff

19:30.764 --> 19:31.765
happens. Sorry.

19:31.765 --> 19:32.565
>> Commissioner, I set my

19:32.565 --> 19:33.400
lineup.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.401
You saw me set my lineup.

19:34.401 --> 19:35.035
>> Ruxin, you know how this

19:35.035 --> 19:35.635
works.

19:35.635 --> 19:36.569
>> Yeah, I know exactly how this

19:36.569 --> 19:37.437
works.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.438
All you parasites collude

19:38.438 --> 19:39.572
against me, and then just when

19:39.572 --> 19:40.807
it matters most, you screw me.

19:40.807 --> 19:41.975
>> Your finger colluded against

19:41.975 --> 19:42.976
you.

19:42.976 --> 19:44.077
>> No, your outfit colluded

19:44.077 --> 19:45.078
against you.

19:45.078 --> 19:46.413
You look like a European porn

19:46.413 --> 19:47.414
extra.

19:47.414 --> 19:48.481
>> Hey, babe, did you see these

19:48.481 --> 19:49.616
super cute pictures your mom

19:49.616 --> 19:50.617
sent of the kids?

19:50.617 --> 19:51.618
They are so cute.

19:51.618 --> 19:52.752
>> Oh, my God, I'd love to see

19:52.752 --> 19:53.553
the kids.

19:53.553 --> 19:54.821
Cutie, cutie, so cute.

19:54.821 --> 19:55.822
>> No, that's not my...

19:55.822 --> 19:56.890
>> Oh, what's this?

19:56.890 --> 19:58.058
The e-mail from Andre to the

19:58.058 --> 19:59.092
group about splitting up the

19:59.092 --> 20:00.093
house.

20:00.093 --> 20:01.361
You joking me?

20:01.361 --> 20:02.495
This is collusion!

20:02.495 --> 20:03.396
(shouting)

20:03.396 --> 20:04.631
>> We talk about what we want to

20:04.631 --> 20:05.632
talk about.

20:05.632 --> 20:06.633
>> We split the house.

20:06.633 --> 20:07.634
That doesn't mean we're

20:07.634 --> 20:08.568
colluding against you.

20:08.568 --> 20:09.769
>> So, the, uh, Shiva Bowl is

20:09.769 --> 20:10.703
underway?

20:10.703 --> 20:11.571
>> Yeah, the Shiva Bowl's

20:11.571 --> 20:12.439
underway, because they're

20:12.439 --> 20:13.473
colluding against me, which

20:13.473 --> 20:14.441
means we've officially begun.

20:14.441 --> 20:15.475
>> You can't take someone's

20:15.475 --> 20:16.367
phone and go through their

20:16.367 --> 20:16.810
pictures.

20:16.810 --> 20:17.911
>> You can't take anything.

20:17.911 --> 20:20.547
(shouting)

20:20.547 --> 20:21.981
>> Everybody, please, quiet!

20:21.981 --> 20:23.783
>> ...Potato chip.

20:23.783 --> 20:24.884
>> This is exactly as Mr.

20:24.884 --> 20:25.885
Rappaport predicted.

20:25.885 --> 20:27.120
You people cannot stop acting

20:27.120 --> 20:28.488
like animals, so I am prepared

20:28.488 --> 20:29.556
for this.

20:29.556 --> 20:31.057
I am bringing in the perfect

20:31.057 --> 20:32.425
person to make a ruling.

20:32.425 --> 20:33.726
Everyone, I would like you to

20:33.726 --> 20:34.761
meet Mike Pereira, former head

20:34.761 --> 20:35.795
of NFL Officiating.

20:35.795 --> 20:37.897
>> Yeah, we know who he is.

20:37.897 --> 20:39.332
We watch him on TV every week.

20:39.332 --> 20:40.500
>> What are you doing here?

20:40.500 --> 20:41.801
>> Ted-Ted was a good man.

20:41.801 --> 20:43.103
I'm just here to help him with

20:43.103 --> 20:44.104
his final wishes.

20:44.104 --> 20:45.405
>> I don't know how to tell you

20:45.405 --> 20:46.372
this, but Ted died.

20:46.372 --> 20:48.508
>> Okay, well, I have, uh,

20:48.508 --> 20:49.509
filled Mike in on everything

20:49.509 --> 20:50.610
that's transpired thus far this

20:50.610 --> 20:51.644
morning.

20:51.644 --> 20:52.612
>> Well, I can tell you right

20:52.612 --> 20:53.646
now that I pressed the submit

20:53.646 --> 20:54.647
button.

20:54.647 --> 20:55.715
My finger crossed the plane.

20:55.715 --> 20:57.016
>> Okay, well, let's go under

20:57.016 --> 20:58.118
the hood and review it.

20:58.118 --> 20:59.119
>> It's a kitchen hood.

20:59.119 --> 21:00.487
>> Hey, respect the stripes.

21:00.487 --> 21:01.788
>> I'm trying to respect the

21:01.788 --> 21:02.789
stripe on your stupid hat.

21:02.789 --> 21:05.458
>> Hey, I see a finger smudge

21:05.458 --> 21:06.626
here.

21:06.626 --> 21:07.494
>> That's the one.

21:07.494 --> 21:08.394
That's my print.

21:08.394 --> 21:09.129
That's my fingerprint.

21:09.129 --> 21:11.331
>> I got to mark it.

21:11.331 --> 21:13.333
Got to get my chains out.

21:20.373 --> 21:22.041
After reviewing the play, Ruxin

21:22.041 --> 21:24.677
failed to reach the submit

21:24.677 --> 21:27.413
lineup button when the finger

21:27.413 --> 21:28.414
was down.

21:28.414 --> 21:29.549
You lose your challenge.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.484
>> Send it to New York.

21:31.484 --> 21:32.352
>> I am New York.

21:32.352 --> 21:33.386
We're not gonna send anywhere.

21:33.386 --> 21:34.521
What are you, crazy?

21:34.521 --> 21:35.522
>> You know what, I'm throwing

21:35.522 --> 21:36.723
my red challenge flag, because

21:36.723 --> 21:37.891
these people have been colluding

21:37.891 --> 21:38.892
against me.

21:38.892 --> 21:39.893
I went on her phone, and I saw

21:39.893 --> 21:41.528
proof they were gonna split this

21:41.528 --> 21:42.562
house amongst themselves.

21:42.562 --> 21:43.596
>> You want to know how he saw

21:43.596 --> 21:44.430
that?

21:44.430 --> 21:45.532
He grabbed my phone and went

21:45.532 --> 21:46.799
through all the pictures like a

21:46.799 --> 21:48.835
grubby raccoon.

21:48.835 --> 21:50.036
>> You went through her phone?

21:50.036 --> 21:51.037
>> It doesn't matter how I got

21:51.037 --> 21:52.038
the information.

21:52.038 --> 21:53.039
I got the information that they

21:53.039 --> 21:54.374
were colluding. Red flag.

21:54.374 --> 21:55.408
>> It does matter.

21:55.408 --> 21:56.476
The rules of society, my friend.

21:56.476 --> 21:58.411
If you are looking at a phone

21:58.411 --> 21:59.579
and somebody gives it to you to

21:59.579 --> 22:00.780
look at a photo, you look at

22:00.780 --> 22:02.015
that photo only.

22:02.015 --> 22:03.016
You don't scroll up and down.

22:03.016 --> 22:04.083
You don't look at other e-mails.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.418
You don't open other apps.

22:05.418 --> 22:07.086
You know what that's called?

22:07.086 --> 22:08.721
Illegal scrolling.

22:08.721 --> 22:09.889
>> Yeah, illegal scrolling.

22:09.889 --> 22:10.890
>> I like that.

22:10.890 --> 22:11.925
>> Scrolling.

22:11.925 --> 22:12.926
>> We're picking up the flag for

22:12.926 --> 22:14.394
collusion and you, my friend,

22:14.394 --> 22:15.395
lose your second challenge.

22:15.395 --> 22:16.663
>> Yes!

22:16.663 --> 22:17.664
>> I want to bring back the

22:17.664 --> 22:18.665
replacement refs!

22:18.665 --> 22:19.666
>> Oh, sure, everybody says

22:19.666 --> 22:21.000
that.

22:25.505 --> 22:26.606
>> Well, congratulations, Andre.

22:26.606 --> 22:27.607
You're a Shiva Bowl Champion.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.575
(cheering)

22:28.575 --> 22:30.577
You can just sign here, and then

22:30.577 --> 22:32.812
the house will be yours.

22:32.812 --> 22:33.813
>> That's right.

22:33.813 --> 22:35.415
Okay, thank you so much.

22:35.415 --> 22:36.649
>> You, uh, you all disgust me.

22:36.649 --> 22:38.918
And you perhaps most of all.

22:38.918 --> 22:41.588
You do not deserve this.

22:41.588 --> 22:43.623
Congratulations.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.558
(laughs)

22:45.558 --> 22:47.360
>> Shiva Bowl Champ!

22:47.360 --> 22:48.394
I won! I won!

22:48.394 --> 22:50.363
>> No, we won.

22:50.363 --> 22:51.531
Now let's talk some months,

22:51.531 --> 22:52.532
buddy.

22:52.532 --> 22:53.533
(groans)

22:53.533 --> 22:54.634
>> You all lost.

22:54.634 --> 22:55.468
You're all losers.

22:55.468 --> 22:56.536
A pax on all of your homes.

22:56.536 --> 22:57.604
>> I think you mean pox, Ruxin.

22:57.604 --> 22:58.638
>> No, I mean that the only

22:58.638 --> 22:59.939
cable network you all

22:59.939 --> 23:01.541
should get is PAX.

23:01.541 --> 23:02.609
>> I don't get it.

23:02.609 --> 23:03.643
This is not the lineup I set.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.011
>> Oh, Taco, lose with a little

23:05.011 --> 23:06.112
dignity.

23:06.112 --> 23:07.113
Stop whining.

23:07.113 --> 23:08.114
>> No, I'm telling you,

23:08.114 --> 23:09.115
it's different.

23:09.115 --> 23:10.016
It's not the lineup I set.

23:10.016 --> 23:11.351
>> I wonder what could've

23:11.351 --> 23:12.018
happened.

23:12.018 --> 23:12.986
>> I wonder what could've

23:12.986 --> 23:13.720
happened.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.821
>> Thank you! Thank you!

23:14.821 --> 23:15.955
Thank you!

23:15.955 --> 23:17.523
Thank you, Shiva!

23:17.523 --> 23:18.725
>> Oh, well.

23:18.725 --> 23:19.726
A win's a win, I guess.

23:19.726 --> 23:20.860
>> Yes, it is.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.061
A win is a win.

23:22.061 --> 23:23.396
>> You earned it.

23:23.396 --> 23:24.564
>> I know, I did.

23:24.564 --> 23:25.632
>> Yeah.

23:25.632 --> 23:26.633
I'm proud of you, brother.

23:26.633 --> 23:27.700
>> Thank you.

23:27.700 --> 23:28.534
>> Come on.

23:28.534 --> 23:29.402
>> Well, not proud, just less

23:29.402 --> 23:30.403
embarrassed.

23:30.403 --> 23:31.471
>> No, no.

23:31.471 --> 23:32.372
>> That's interesting.

23:32.372 --> 23:32.972
>> Come on.

23:32.972 --> 23:34.340
>> No. Family functions only.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.942
>> Okay, sorry.

23:35.942 --> 23:36.809
>> Stop it.

23:36.809 --> 23:37.810
This is not a family function.

23:37.810 --> 23:38.811
Sit down.

23:38.811 --> 23:39.946
>> Hey, don't you have something

23:39.946 --> 23:41.047
to do?

23:41.047 --> 23:42.582
>> Yes.

23:42.582 --> 23:43.750
Uh, all right, I would like to

23:43.750 --> 23:44.884
do a league photo on the lower

23:44.884 --> 23:46.052
balcony, so just get everyone

23:46.052 --> 23:47.053
together.

23:47.053 --> 23:48.121
Meet me over there, okay?

23:48.121 --> 23:49.555
>> Guys, I have a quick

23:49.555 --> 23:50.623
announcement to make.

23:50.623 --> 23:52.592
I was just talking to Mike

23:52.592 --> 23:53.726
Pereira, and I think I'm gonna

23:53.726 --> 23:54.794
become a ref.

23:54.794 --> 23:55.862
>> What?

23:55.862 --> 23:56.829
>> Think about it.

23:56.829 --> 23:57.897
Look, I love to be in a position

23:57.897 --> 23:59.032
of power arbitrarily, I love

23:59.032 --> 24:00.700
having people listen to me and

24:00.700 --> 24:02.068
do what I say even if I happen

24:02.068 --> 24:03.569
to be wrong, and I'll never have

24:03.569 --> 24:04.637
to say I'm sorry again.

24:04.637 --> 24:06.406
It's kind of like my calling.

24:06.406 --> 24:07.407
>> And the stripes are pretty

24:07.407 --> 24:08.408
slimming, too.

24:08.408 --> 24:09.409
>> I don't really care about

24:09.409 --> 24:10.009
that.

24:10.009 --> 24:10.610
>> You should.

24:10.610 --> 24:11.577
>> Thank you, Jenny.

24:11.577 --> 24:12.712
>> Well, on that note, please

24:12.712 --> 24:13.713
come with me down to the beach.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.881
>> Oh, boy.

24:14.881 --> 24:17.050
Might need some of that.

24:17.050 --> 24:18.584
>> Rafi, hey, come on!

24:18.584 --> 24:19.886
It's time for the prank.

24:19.886 --> 24:21.788
Rafi?

24:21.788 --> 24:24.657
(grunting)

24:24.657 --> 24:25.692
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:25.692 --> 24:26.893
>> Huh?

24:26.893 --> 24:27.927
>> Wait, what's all this?

24:27.927 --> 24:28.928
>> Allow me to introduce you to

24:28.928 --> 24:29.962
my two favorite pranksters,

24:29.962 --> 24:31.064
gasoline and kerosene.

24:31.064 --> 24:32.532
>> No! Why do you have all this

24:32.532 --> 24:33.533
stuff?

24:33.533 --> 24:34.067
>> For the prank.

24:34.067 --> 24:35.068
I told you I'd take care of it.

24:35.068 --> 24:36.069
>> You're gonna light them on

24:36.069 --> 24:36.936
fire?!

24:36.936 --> 24:37.770
>> It's a prank!

24:37.770 --> 24:38.871
>> No, I want you to take water

24:38.871 --> 24:39.872
and pour it onto their heads.

24:39.872 --> 24:41.040
>> Brian, water puts out fire.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.942
How do you not know this?

24:42.942 --> 24:44.344
Oh, my God, you are adorable.

24:44.344 --> 24:45.645
(chuckles)

24:45.645 --> 24:46.846
I don't think you know how

24:46.846 --> 24:47.847
pranks work.

24:47.847 --> 24:48.948
>> The year of the Dre begins

24:48.948 --> 24:50.083
now.

24:50.083 --> 24:51.451
We'll put aside our petty

24:51.451 --> 24:52.852
disagreements, and, in the words

24:52.852 --> 24:54.687
of Taylor Swift, we will just

24:54.687 --> 24:56.622
shake it off.

24:56.622 --> 24:57.690
(booing)

24:57.690 --> 24:59.392
Okay, in the spirit of good

24:59.392 --> 25:00.626
sportsmanship, I present a

25:00.626 --> 25:02.729
message to you, my fellow

25:02.729 --> 25:06.065
league-mates.

25:06.065 --> 25:07.333
Enjoy!

25:07.333 --> 25:09.469
(chuckles)

25:09.469 --> 25:10.670
>> Ooh!

25:10.670 --> 25:11.571
>> Wow, that's pretty cool.

25:11.571 --> 25:13.439
(laughter, cheering)

25:13.439 --> 25:14.674
>> Hey!

25:14.674 --> 25:15.675
>> Suck it?

25:15.675 --> 25:16.609
(groaning)

25:16.609 --> 25:17.076
>> Come on!

25:17.076 --> 25:17.977
>> You stole my saying.

25:17.977 --> 25:18.911
>> I co-opted it.

25:18.911 --> 25:19.979
In the year of the Dre, I say

25:19.979 --> 25:21.381
suck it.

25:21.381 --> 25:22.382
>> What are we supposed to suck,

25:22.382 --> 25:23.449
Andre?

25:23.449 --> 25:24.016
>> The butthole.

25:24.016 --> 25:24.984
>> We're supposed to suck your

25:24.984 --> 25:25.651
butthole?

25:25.651 --> 25:26.819
>> No, everyone's butthole.

25:26.819 --> 25:27.820
>> We have to suck everyone's

25:27.820 --> 25:28.621
butthole?

25:28.621 --> 25:29.622
>> It's my butthole.

25:29.622 --> 25:30.723
Fine, suck my butthole.

25:30.723 --> 25:32.358
>> So you made some fireworks so

25:32.358 --> 25:33.559
that we could all suck your

25:33.559 --> 25:34.560
butthole?

25:34.560 --> 25:35.561
>> Yes, it's a punishment.

25:35.561 --> 25:36.529
When you've been bad, you have

25:36.529 --> 25:37.063
to suck the butthole.

25:37.063 --> 25:37.997
>> So when everybody's saying

25:37.997 --> 25:38.898
"suck it," you think we're

25:38.898 --> 25:39.799
talking about buttholes, just to

25:39.799 --> 25:40.633
be clear?

25:40.633 --> 25:41.434
>> What else would you be

25:41.434 --> 25:41.875
talking about?

25:41.875 --> 25:42.735
>> What about dicks?

25:42.735 --> 25:43.803
>> Why would you even do that?

25:43.803 --> 25:45.037
Ew, ew, ew.

25:45.037 --> 25:46.672
>> Have you ever gotten a blow

25:46.672 --> 25:47.673
job?

25:47.673 --> 25:49.509
>> Yeah, I've had a blow job.

25:49.509 --> 25:50.643
>> You've had one?

25:50.643 --> 25:51.711
>> Andre.

25:51.711 --> 25:52.745
>> What, I've had plenty of...

25:52.745 --> 25:54.580
>> You're lying, first of all,

25:54.580 --> 25:55.681
but you've had your butthole

25:55.681 --> 25:56.682
sucked on?

25:56.682 --> 25:57.817
>> Yeah, it's second base.

25:57.817 --> 25:58.818
>> You think that's what second

25:58.818 --> 25:59.852
base is?

25:59.852 --> 26:00.853
>> What? It's not?

26:00.853 --> 26:03.022
>> I do not want you to light

26:03.022 --> 26:04.357
our friends and family on fire!

26:04.357 --> 26:05.591
>> Brian, this is what taking

26:05.591 --> 26:06.592
care of it is.

26:06.592 --> 26:07.593
>> No, I don't want you to

26:07.593 --> 26:08.428
handle this prank.

26:08.428 --> 26:09.362
You are now out of this prank

26:09.362 --> 26:10.329
game.

26:10.329 --> 26:11.330
>> Brian, just smell this.

26:11.330 --> 26:12.331
>> No! Put that down!

26:12.331 --> 26:13.366
>> It's hilarious.

26:13.366 --> 26:14.333
>> That is the opposite of

26:14.333 --> 26:15.334
what I want you to do.

26:15.334 --> 26:16.068
>> Brian, why are you ruining

26:16.068 --> 26:16.903
this prank?

26:16.903 --> 26:17.837
>> How does this thing play out

26:17.837 --> 26:18.538
in your mind, okay?

26:18.538 --> 26:19.572
You pour gasoline on our

26:19.572 --> 26:20.640
friends, and then what?

26:20.640 --> 26:21.641
>> We light them on fire!

26:21.641 --> 26:22.642
And they're like, "Oh, my God!

26:22.642 --> 26:23.843
Rafi and Brian pranked us!"

26:23.843 --> 26:25.077
(laughs)

26:25.077 --> 26:26.579
>> No, they won't be laughing,

26:26.579 --> 26:27.580
because they'll be on fire!

26:27.580 --> 26:28.648
>> Of course they're gonna be on

26:28.648 --> 26:29.816
fire, and yes, they're gonna

26:29.816 --> 26:30.917
die, but then we're gonna bury

26:30.917 --> 26:33.019
their remains under this house

26:33.019 --> 26:34.654
where we will live for the rest

26:34.654 --> 26:36.022
of our days as best friends!

26:36.022 --> 26:37.557
Hilarious prank!

26:37.557 --> 26:39.592
>> What?

26:39.592 --> 26:40.593
Oh, shit.

26:40.593 --> 26:41.828
>> (chuckles) Oh, boy.

26:41.828 --> 26:42.862
Reverse prank.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.096
>> I'm out of here!

26:44.096 --> 26:46.065
>> I don't need you guys, okay?

26:46.065 --> 26:47.600
You know what, this is the year

26:47.600 --> 26:48.668
of the Dre!

26:48.668 --> 26:51.070
>> Andre, look behind you!

26:51.070 --> 26:52.338
>> I'm not gonna look behind me.

26:52.338 --> 26:53.439
I'm gonna look ahead, to the

26:53.439 --> 26:54.106
future!

26:54.106 --> 26:55.341
>> Andre, you're on fire.

26:55.341 --> 26:56.676
>> I am on fire with winning.

26:56.676 --> 26:57.944
I'm unstoppable now!

26:57.944 --> 26:59.712
>> We made a mistake!

26:59.712 --> 27:00.746
Get back!

27:00.746 --> 27:01.781
>> Awesome prank!

27:01.781 --> 27:03.082
>> Oh, God!

27:03.082 --> 27:04.584
>> Watch this!

27:04.584 --> 27:05.585
It's gonna be hilarious!

27:05.585 --> 27:06.586
(screaming)

27:06.586 --> 27:07.720
Yes!

27:07.720 --> 27:09.355
Pranked! Pranked!

27:09.355 --> 27:11.757
Yeah!

27:11.757 --> 27:12.758
>> Whoa!

27:12.758 --> 27:13.893
>> Shiva!

27:13.893 --> 27:14.927
Hey, I thought she was washed

27:14.927 --> 27:15.995
out to sea.

27:15.995 --> 27:17.330
>> Oops.

27:17.330 --> 27:17.964
>> My beach house.

27:17.964 --> 27:19.599
>> You stupid assholes.

27:19.599 --> 27:21.467
>> No way, dead guy.

27:21.467 --> 27:23.736
Best prank ever!

27:23.736 --> 27:25.671
>> Rafi, what did you do?

27:25.671 --> 27:26.672
>> That was Brian's idea.

27:26.672 --> 27:27.673
I just helped.

27:27.673 --> 27:29.675
>> ALL: Brian!
