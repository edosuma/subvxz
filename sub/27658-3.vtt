00:02.000 --> 00:04.320
Hello, and welcome to Hotspots,
which this week comes to you from

00:04.320 --> 00:06.240
the beautiful island of Saint Marie.

00:06.240 --> 00:10.279
This pint-sized resort may be small,
but it has all the trappings

00:10.279 --> 00:14.320
of the more familiar Caribbean
holiday destinations.

00:14.320 --> 00:19.120
Namely, sun, sea and sand by the
bucketful. And...

00:19.120 --> 00:21.519
SHE SIGHS
What is that line?

00:21.519 --> 00:24.239
Sorry, guys. Reset, everyone,
let's go again.

00:24.239 --> 00:26.600
Yeah, and if you fancy a break from
the wind and rain and

00:26.600 --> 00:29.000
checking out this fantastic
hot spot... I've got it!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.239
It's almost seven, we're not going
to complete.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.479
Then we go over.
I need these shots, Pippa.

00:33.479 --> 00:36.399
This is the third night this week,
we're not doing it gratis again.

00:36.399 --> 00:40.159
Tell you what, how about the few
beers on wrap instead? My treat.

00:40.159 --> 00:43.159
There are union rules about
overtime, Bill.

00:43.159 --> 00:44.719
I know there are, Terry, old boy.

00:44.719 --> 00:47.520
But you know what they say
about rules, don't you?

00:48.799 --> 00:52.119
If there's a free beer, I'm in.
Let's just get this done and dusted.

00:52.119 --> 00:57.840
That's the spirit, Andy. Catrina,
love, you ready? Sets...and action.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.560
Hello, and welcome to Hotspots,
which this week comes to you

01:01.560 --> 01:04.358
from the beautiful island of Saint
Marie...

01:09.120 --> 01:13.680
People assume that all my job
entails is pressing play and record.

01:13.680 --> 01:14.960
But there is a real craft.

01:14.960 --> 01:19.200
Do you think someone should go and
rescue that bartender? Probably.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.799
Bagsie not me. 12 series of this
show -

01:22.799 --> 01:25.039
I'm done with the dreary old bugger.

01:25.039 --> 01:28.280
If only he wasn't so damn good at
his job.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.240
Fancy another?

01:32.240 --> 01:35.560
Go on, then, a quick one - got to be
up early to Skype the wife and kids.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.240
Quick one it is.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.200
WOMEN CHAT

01:41.079 --> 01:42.960
You do know that you two ladies are

01:42.960 --> 01:46.000
the hardest working woman
in television? We do.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.280
And I'm going to remind you of that
fact the next time we

01:48.280 --> 01:50.079
negotiate my fee bill.

01:50.079 --> 01:53.879
Oh, Lord, I've gone and done it now,
haven't I?

01:53.879 --> 01:55.680
Great.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.159
Thank you so much, Pippa. I think
I'm going to call it a night.

01:59.159 --> 02:03.079
See you in the morning. Night,
gents. Night. Night.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.560
Night, Terry! Night.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.280 --> 02:54.319
Yeah, we're just about to leave,
so we'll be there in 20.

02:54.319 --> 02:58.120
Morning, morning.
All present and correct?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.920
No Catrina.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.759
It's not like her to be late.
I'll give her a call.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.599
RINGING TONE

03:12.039 --> 03:13.520
Bill...

03:26.560 --> 03:27.599
Oh, God!

03:31.639 --> 03:33.120
She's dead, Bill.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.879
Morning, sir.
Hey, Jack. Morning.

04:18.879 --> 04:21.439
Shouldn't you two be boarding
a ferry right about now?

04:21.439 --> 04:25.120
Not if I can't find my passport.
Elusive things, passports.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.519
I used to drive Mrs Mooney up the
wall, rooting around

04:27.519 --> 04:30.040
in the kitchen drawer
with the taxi waiting outside.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.040
Whereas I always say,
a holiday's not really a holiday

04:33.040 --> 04:34.759
unless it begins with a blazing row.

04:38.639 --> 04:43.240
What is that? A mongoose?
Yeah. Either that or a polecat.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.959
I'm not entirely sure, to be honest
with you, Patrice.

04:45.959 --> 04:48.720
Whatever he is, his name is Sherman.
I found it!

04:50.720 --> 04:52.279
Why do you have a...

04:52.279 --> 04:56.199
..whatever that is? Yeah, there's a
tale to be told there, Florence.

04:56.199 --> 04:59.120
But don't you have a romantic
weekend to be getting on with?

04:59.120 --> 05:02.519
And if you need me, sir,
I'll have my mobile on at all times.

05:02.519 --> 05:06.399
You'll do no such thing, just enjoy
yourself. And that's an order!

05:06.399 --> 05:10.360
Morning, sir! Morning JP, Ruby.
Morning, sir.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.480
We just got a call reporting
a dead body being washed up on the

05:13.480 --> 05:15.279
beach of Paradise...

05:16.319 --> 05:19.079
Well, sweet Mary,
what the hell is that?

05:19.079 --> 05:21.439
His name is Sherman. He'll be
keeping us company

05:21.439 --> 05:24.680
for the next couple of weeks.
I'll explain it all later.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.560
Sounds like we need to get to the
Paradise Bay Hotel. Yes.

05:31.399 --> 05:35.399
So, he done that before - you know,
bring a little friend to work?

05:35.399 --> 05:40.680
Nope, that is a new one. The
victim's name is Catrina McVey.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.399
She was here on the island filming
a holiday programme called Hotspot.

05:44.399 --> 05:47.120
Yeah, I know the one.
Siobhan used to watch it,

05:47.120 --> 05:48.920
planning the summer hols.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.199
Catrina McVey, she was the
presenter, right? I believe so, sir.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.079
She would have been only in her 20s,
the poor girl.

06:02.399 --> 06:06.360
Always seemed a friendly sort,
you know, on the telly.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.600
So, what do we think has
occurred here?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
Well, sir,
her clothes are over there.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.000
Seems she got undressed
and went for a swim.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.279
Paramedics are calling it
accidental drowning.

06:16.279 --> 06:19.519
And do we know when it happened?
They're estimating late last night.

06:19.519 --> 06:22.920
And no-one was with her?
Not according to her colleagues.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.199
The weather last night -
wasn't stormy, was it?

06:29.199 --> 06:31.480
Nope, it was definitely a hot one.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.800
This bay here is pretty well
sheltered. Yes, it is, sir.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.319
Well, that is odd, isn't it?
Catrina is young, fit, healthy.

06:40.319 --> 06:44.079
This stretch of sea is
calm as bath water.

06:44.079 --> 06:46.240
There's no obvious head injuries to
suggest

06:46.240 --> 06:48.519
she got into any sort of trouble,
so...

06:48.519 --> 06:50.439
How come she drowned?

06:51.759 --> 06:54.519
Ruby, there should be a magnifying
glass in the crime scene kit.

06:54.519 --> 06:57.720
JP, have a quick flick through
the victim's clothes, would you?

07:03.800 --> 07:06.399
Sir, there's nothing but
her room key.

07:06.399 --> 07:08.920
I was right about her
not just suddenly drowning.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.439
Faint traces of fingermarks
on her shoulders,

07:11.439 --> 07:13.600
some tearing to the skin
on the neck.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.480
Same kind of markings you'd find
if someone was forcing you down

07:18.480 --> 07:22.160
under the water. So, Catrina's death
WASN'T an accident?

07:22.160 --> 07:23.680
I think someone did this to her.

07:27.399 --> 07:29.800
I'll have a chat with her
colleagues. You can release

07:29.800 --> 07:32.480
the body, finish processing the
scene, and then when you get

07:32.480 --> 07:35.439
a chance, will you talk to the hotel
staff and guests? See if anyone

07:35.439 --> 07:38.759
saw Catrina on the beach last night.
Yes, Inspector Mooney. Will do, sir.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.279
So, I'm right in thinking
that you were all with Catrina last

07:49.279 --> 07:51.319
night, before she went to her room?

07:51.319 --> 07:54.519
Bill had arranged some beers
for us on wrap. Officially speaking,

07:54.519 --> 07:57.639
we should have all been paid
overtime. Not now, Terry, old chap.

07:59.519 --> 08:01.279
And Catrina was the first to go up?

08:03.120 --> 08:06.360
Night, gents. Night. Night, Terry!

08:06.360 --> 08:08.839
We stayed for another half an hour.

08:08.839 --> 08:11.600
Then we all headed to our rooms.
Right.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.319
Did any of you see her after that?

08:17.920 --> 08:21.360
And I wonder, did Catrina know
anybody else here on Saint Marie?

08:21.360 --> 08:24.319
No-one. We only arrived the day
before yesterday.

08:24.319 --> 08:26.720
And we've pretty much all been
together since we got here.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.639
Have you now? Hmm.
That's interesting.

08:32.840 --> 08:36.759
How have things been between you
all - you know, during the shoot?

08:36.759 --> 08:39.840
Considering we've been living in
each other's pockets the last

08:39.840 --> 08:42.639
three months, I'd say
we got on pretty darn well. Right.

08:44.679 --> 08:45.879
That's grand.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.840
Is something wrong, Inspector?
No. It's just...

08:51.840 --> 08:54.519
Well, you should know, we're
treating Catrina's death

08:54.519 --> 08:57.080
as a murder. Crikey!
What, you think one of us did it?

08:57.080 --> 09:00.360
Well,
it's something we have to consider.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.360
Why would any of us do that?

09:02.360 --> 09:05.320
She was a damn good sort,
that girl - kind, caring,

09:05.320 --> 09:07.720
not a whiff of ego in her bones.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.000
Well, only time will tell.
Thank you for your time.

09:19.399 --> 09:22.159
OK, so this is our second case
together, Ruby.

09:22.159 --> 09:25.919
And I really want us to focus on our
organisational skills.

09:25.919 --> 09:29.039
The key to good policing is to
always be methodical.

09:29.039 --> 09:33.039
That it is, JP, that it is. Good.
So, we're going to do this room by
room.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.200
I'll need the name and room number
of everyone we speak to.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.919
You start this end, I'll start that.

09:38.919 --> 09:43.240
Got it. All right. Excuse me, sir!

09:44.720 --> 09:46.399
We're investigating a crime

09:46.399 --> 09:48.960
that happened here at the hotel
last night.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.600
Now, where were you around about
midnight? I don't know. Psst! JP!

09:55.840 --> 09:59.240
Uh, hold on for one second, please.
Sure. Thank you.

10:00.519 --> 10:02.279
What's the problem?

10:02.279 --> 10:05.039
I seem to have forgotten my notepad,
so I was wondering if I might

10:05.039 --> 10:06.639
borrow a piece of paper, please.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.559
Sorry, JP, won't happen again.

10:13.399 --> 10:15.039
HE LAUGHS AWKWARDLY

10:16.120 --> 10:18.559
Um, sorry about that.

10:18.559 --> 10:21.399
So, as I was saying,
we are investigating a crime that

10:21.399 --> 10:23.720
happened here at the hotel
last night.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.440
Where exactly were you...?

10:31.159 --> 10:33.399
HE GROANS

10:43.799 --> 10:46.720
Thank you very much, sir.
You're welcome. All right.

10:46.720 --> 10:51.159
JP, you got a minute? Give us a hand
searching the victim's room.

10:51.159 --> 10:53.360
Yeah, sure. Great.

10:59.039 --> 11:02.559
Only one glass -
suggests she didn't have company.

11:02.559 --> 11:05.360
Have a look in her suitcase there.
Yes, sir.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.120
Hmm...

11:11.320 --> 11:14.919
She made a phone call last night
to a man called Jake Harrington,

11:14.919 --> 11:16.200
half ten.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.879
That's not long before she was
drowned. We should get in touch.

11:19.879 --> 11:22.320
Yeah, see what that was all about.
Yes, sir.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.759
Now, what's this?

11:37.879 --> 11:40.600
She's been all over the place
the last few months.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.519
Morocco, Cuba, Florida.
That is some job, that is -

11:44.519 --> 11:47.720
travelling the world and getting
paid for it. Lucky beggars.

11:49.240 --> 11:53.120
JP, with Florence away, I might need
you to step up over the next

11:53.120 --> 11:56.679
few days. Fancy taking on
a bit more responsibility?

11:56.679 --> 11:59.840
Yes, sir, very much so, thank you.
Good man.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.440
Let's see if we can't crack this one
together, eh? Yes, sir.

12:04.519 --> 12:05.919
OK...

12:32.759 --> 12:35.279
Inspector. Commissioner!

12:37.000 --> 12:42.159
Your desk appears to have
a small furry animal upon it.

12:42.159 --> 12:44.759
Your powers of perception are,
as ever, faultless.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.080
Commissioner, meet Sherman.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.399
Might I ask why it is
you're in possession of this thing?

12:51.399 --> 12:55.399
Well, what it is, I nipped into the
barber's last night on the way home

12:55.399 --> 12:59.919
for a quick trim, and got inveigled
into a high-stakes game of dominoes.

12:59.919 --> 13:02.279
So, you won it?

13:02.279 --> 13:05.279
No, Darnell from the post office
won it, but turns out,

13:05.279 --> 13:07.840
Darnell's wife,
she's not exactly an animal lover,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.840
so I've been lumped baby-sitting
the furry fellow until

13:10.840 --> 13:13.759
Mrs Darnell comes around to the idea
of having a pet in the house.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.840
Was there something I could do
for you, Commissioner?

13:18.919 --> 13:22.159
I had the Minister for Tourism
on the phone.

13:22.159 --> 13:25.039
The woman whose body was found
this morning, she was part of a

13:25.039 --> 13:28.639
television crew over here
filming a holiday programme.

13:28.639 --> 13:30.360
That's right - Hotspots.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.080
Goes out on the Holiday Channel,
it's actually quite good.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.639
The Minister is keen, with such
a spotlight thrown on the island,

13:36.639 --> 13:39.759
that the makers of this TV show
should see us at our very best

13:39.759 --> 13:42.960
as we respond
to this tragic situation.

13:44.159 --> 13:47.600
Would you care for me to go through
what we have so far? Yes, Inspector.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.799
Now, our victim is one
Catrina McVey, 32 years old,

13:55.799 --> 13:58.720
born and raised
in Aberdare in Wales.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.919
Catrina left school
at the age of 16,

14:00.919 --> 14:04.440
she worked at a variety of jobs
until her early 20s, and then

14:04.440 --> 14:07.720
she saw an advert for a job at a
production company based in Bristol.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.480
And that would be Pathway
Productions? That's right, yes.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.600
That's this fella's baby,
Bill Calder.

14:12.600 --> 14:16.679
He founded the company in 2011,
made the Hotspots pilot in 2012.

14:16.679 --> 14:20.919
Since then, there have been
12 series. And your suspects?

14:20.919 --> 14:24.879
Well, Bill Calder himself.
An old hand, as they say.

14:24.879 --> 14:27.080
Much like yourself, Commissioner.

14:29.039 --> 14:32.200
Pippa Mayhew, she's the show's
production coordinator.

14:32.200 --> 14:36.159
Privately educated, I reckon
our Pip is a bit of a poshie.

14:36.159 --> 14:38.039
Next up, Andy Spriggs.

14:38.039 --> 14:39.600
Er...

14:41.600 --> 14:44.639
Now, Andy's our camera operator
based in Leeds.

14:44.639 --> 14:48.000
Married with two children, and
mostly freelances in productions

14:48.000 --> 14:49.480
filming in the north of England.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.279
And finally?
Terry Brownlow, the sound man.

14:52.279 --> 14:55.279
He resides at his mother's address
in Kidderminster.

14:55.279 --> 14:57.320
I believe she recently passed away.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.279
And you believe one of these four
have something to do with

15:00.279 --> 15:03.480
Miss McVey's death? I'm convinced
one of them is lying to us,

15:03.480 --> 15:06.639
and was on the beach last night
and drowned our victim.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.120
Keep me abreast of developments.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.679
PHONE RINGS
Don't take it personally, Sherman,

15:24.679 --> 15:26.320
he's like that with everybody.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.279
Inspector Mooney speaking.

15:30.279 --> 15:33.120
We've got a witness, sir, who saw
the victim heading over to the

15:33.120 --> 15:37.240
beach late last night, and
apparently, Catrina was not alone.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.799
She was seen with a man,
holding hands and kissing.

15:39.799 --> 15:43.120
Well, I'll be jiggered.
And did the witness recognise him?

15:43.120 --> 15:46.919
Not by name, sir, but she described
him as being Asian, 40-ish,

15:46.919 --> 15:50.000
you know, good-looking. Well,
there's only one person

15:50.000 --> 15:52.480
matching that description -
Andy Spriggs.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.159
You need to let me explain.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.679
It sounded so glamorous, this gig -

15:59.679 --> 16:03.360
travelling to all these exotic
places, seeing the world.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.200
Just never...been away from home
this long before.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.519
Just...

16:10.000 --> 16:14.799
..missed having someone to curl up
with... Someone to hold.

16:14.799 --> 16:18.919
It was more than cuddling, yourself
and Catrina were getting up to.

16:21.240 --> 16:26.120
So, what? Did she want more? Was
she threatening to tell your wife?

16:26.120 --> 16:28.440
God, no, no.
Nothing like that. She was...

16:28.440 --> 16:31.480
She just wanted some affection,
same as me, that's all.

16:33.519 --> 16:36.639
I know what you're thinking,
Inspector.

16:36.639 --> 16:38.840
I didn't kill her.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.440
OK.

16:40.440 --> 16:44.679
Well, why don't you tell me
exactly what happened last night?

16:44.679 --> 16:47.879
I was asleep. There was a knock
on my door, it was Catrina.

16:47.879 --> 16:50.159
She said she fancied having some
company,

16:50.159 --> 16:51.840
so we walked down to the beach.

16:51.840 --> 16:56.759
She was in this weird mood,
restless. Any idea why?

16:56.759 --> 16:58.639
She wouldn't say.

16:58.639 --> 17:02.600
Just something about being held back
in her life, she was fed up by it.

17:03.639 --> 17:07.358
I assumed it was the drink talking.
You're saying Catrina was drunk?

17:07.358 --> 17:10.358
She was slurring her words,
unsteady on her feet.

17:10.358 --> 17:14.279
Next thing, she said she wanted to
go for a swim,

17:14.279 --> 17:17.240
to swim out...feel free.

17:17.240 --> 17:21.000
Right, and you went in with her?
Not at first.

17:22.118 --> 17:26.000
Catrina kept saying how warm the
water was, and I finally went in.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.519
Suddenly she wasn't there any more.

17:29.519 --> 17:33.680
I thought she was playing some joke
on me, but then I saw her body

17:33.680 --> 17:35.680
just floating there.

17:36.839 --> 17:38.319
Lifeless.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.480
So, I swam across and pulled her to
the shore, but I'm not a good

17:43.480 --> 17:46.039
swimmer and I struggled
dragging her body.

17:46.039 --> 17:47.920
So, that's how the marks got on her.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.480
It was you that put them there while
you were pulling the body

17:50.480 --> 17:52.039
back to shore.

17:52.039 --> 17:55.119
When I brought her back to the
beach, I tried taking her pulse, but

17:55.119 --> 17:58.160
there was nothing I could do,
she was gone.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.720
Dead. And then?

18:01.160 --> 18:04.279
You just left her there? I panicked.

18:04.279 --> 18:06.920
Worried what it was going to look
like.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.480
All I could think about was how...
Your wife and family would find out

18:09.480 --> 18:10.920
what you'd been up to.

18:13.119 --> 18:14.559
So sorry.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.640
But can you see, Inspector?

18:19.200 --> 18:23.079
Catrina's death was just a tragic
accident. Nobody killed her.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.200
You know, what happened -

18:33.200 --> 18:35.920
it's not like me,
I'm not a bad man, Inspector.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.200
Not exactly
a paragon of virtue either.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.200
Having an affair behind your wife's
back and then leaving a woman

18:41.200 --> 18:42.759
for dead on the beach.

18:42.759 --> 18:45.920
Reckon the old moral compass
is just a teensy bit off there.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.960
So, Andy Spriggs is saying
no-one killed Catrina?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.960
I don't get it either, JP.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.400
Why would a fit young woman like
Catrina suddenly drown in calm,

19:08.400 --> 19:11.359
shallow waters?
Doesn't make any sense.

19:11.359 --> 19:14.720
Ah, sir, the preliminary autopsy
report has just arrived.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.039
I'm printing it. Let's have a look.

19:18.039 --> 19:19.799
OK...

19:19.799 --> 19:23.880
It confirms Catrina died of cardiac
arrest, secondary to drowning.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.720
Time of death,
close to midnight, as expected.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.920
And the toxicology report...

19:32.599 --> 19:35.640
Uh-huh.
HE CHUCKLES

19:35.640 --> 19:39.000
Yeah, finally, starting
to make a bit of sense. Sir?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.200
Significant traces of Meridil found
in the victim's system.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.599
What's Meridil?

19:43.599 --> 19:47.079
It's a beta-blocker, and the hefty
amount that Catrina ingested,

19:47.079 --> 19:50.160
mixed with the alcohol she consumed,
led her to lose consciousness.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.839
Which is why she suddenly drowned.
She passed out in the water.

19:53.839 --> 19:56.920
So, we've the answer to our
problem - why did Catrina drown?

19:56.920 --> 19:59.160
Because somebody
as good as poisoned her,

19:59.160 --> 20:01.480
intending for her
to fall unconscious in the sea.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.799
All we need to work out now is
how and when did the killer get

20:04.799 --> 20:07.160
the drug into her system?
Well, there's the wine bottle

20:07.160 --> 20:08.559
and a glass we found in her room.

20:08.559 --> 20:11.319
OK, well, let's get them tested
for traces of this Meridil.

20:11.319 --> 20:14.920
The only other drink that Catrina
had that we know about was

20:14.920 --> 20:17.880
down in the bar with the rest of
the television crew.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.839
Bill had arranged some beers
for us on wrap.

20:20.839 --> 20:25.160
So, first thing tomorrow, can one of
you speak to the barman on duty, see

20:25.160 --> 20:27.759
if there's any chance of recovering
the bottles they drank from?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.319
Yes, sir.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.839
OK...

20:33.480 --> 20:35.039
Everything all right, sir?

20:37.640 --> 20:40.839
If you were going to drug someone
so they'd lose consciousness in

20:40.839 --> 20:44.759
the sea and drown, the first thing
you'd need to make sure of is

20:44.759 --> 20:47.559
they were actually going to go
for a swim, right? Right.

20:47.559 --> 20:49.680
Thing is, Andy Spriggs said

20:49.680 --> 20:53.559
Catrina's decision to go for
a midnight dip was spontaneous.

20:53.559 --> 20:56.599
So, no-one could have known what was
actually going to do. Exactly.

20:56.599 --> 21:00.000
Yet seemingly our killer did know.
How?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.559
Right, then.

21:14.559 --> 21:16.920
Cornflakes for Jack. Yum-yum...

21:16.920 --> 21:20.359
Mangoes and mosquito for Harry...

21:20.359 --> 21:23.000
And one dead mouse for Sherman.

21:30.799 --> 21:32.559
Oh, no!

21:40.079 --> 21:42.000
Sherman!

21:42.000 --> 21:43.759
Sherman!

21:45.640 --> 21:49.519
Morning, everybody. Morning, sir.
On your own today, sir?

21:49.519 --> 21:53.200
Well, something of a code red
situation vis-a-vis Sherman.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.960
Code red vis a what?
He's done a bunk.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.319
Chewed his way through the catch
on the cage and did a midnight flit.

21:58.319 --> 22:01.359
What are you going to do, sir?
I don't know, Ruby, but I'll tell

22:01.359 --> 22:04.759
you this. It's the last time I ever
play dominoes. So, where are we at?

22:04.759 --> 22:08.039
OK, sir. I've requested the
suspects' and the victim's phone

22:08.039 --> 22:11.920
and financial records. Catrina's
network provider has given us access

22:11.920 --> 22:14.519
to her e-mails, and
I got Ruby to check out exactly

22:14.519 --> 22:16.480
who this Jake Harrington guy is.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.680
The guy Catrina called
the night she was killed.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.279
He was her agent back in the UK, so
I left a message for him to call us.

22:22.279 --> 22:25.240
And Ruby's just heading over to the
hotel to speak to the barman

22:25.240 --> 22:28.079
about crew drinks.
Well, let us know how you get on.

22:28.079 --> 22:31.680
Oh, Ruby, you have any problems,
just, you know, call me.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.599
I'll ring, JP. Whatever you want.

22:33.599 --> 22:36.079
Oh, Ruby...
Have you forgotten something?

22:40.480 --> 22:42.599
What am I like?!

22:42.599 --> 22:47.000
Baby steps, JP, baby steps.
Yeah. So, what else have we got?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.440
Yes. One more thing, sir.

22:49.440 --> 22:53.279
I requested footage,
recorded the day Catrina was killed.

22:53.279 --> 22:56.160
Just to see if there were any
tensions among the crew, sir.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.240
Three months travelling and working
together, bound to take a toll.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.319
Yeah. I came across this,

23:01.319 --> 23:05.160
recorded at the end of the day
just as they were about to finish.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.839
..in this week's competition...

23:07.839 --> 23:09.640
Perfect, Catrina.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.079
Andy, keep rolling, I want some GVs.

23:12.079 --> 23:15.960
This is just visual shots, sir, but
the sound does keep on recording,

23:15.960 --> 23:18.359
and it picked up a conversation

23:18.359 --> 23:21.799
between Terry and Catrina on her
mic. There.

23:21.799 --> 23:25.160
Are you OK, Terry?
Of course. I'm fine.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.279
I should never have told you about
it. I wish I hadn't.

23:28.279 --> 23:31.279
No, no, I'm glad you did -
it's just hard for me, you know?

23:32.480 --> 23:35.599
You know what you mean to me,
don't you? How much I care.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.640
So, she says,
"I should never have told you."

23:40.640 --> 23:44.039
What was she referring to, sir?
Her affair with Andy?

23:44.039 --> 23:46.519
Terry was jealous,
disapproving maybe?

23:46.519 --> 23:50.319
On our recording, sir, he does sound
a little bit... Intense.

23:54.079 --> 23:58.160
You know what you mean to me,
don't you? How much I care.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.359
It's really not how it seems.
It rarely is, Terry, rarely is.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.000
Catrina and me,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.720
we'd been working on the show since
the beginning - we're old friends.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.519
Yes, but, on that recording, you
can't deny, you do sound a little...

24:13.519 --> 24:15.079
Intense.

24:16.839 --> 24:19.519
I don't have romantic feelings
for Catrina,

24:19.519 --> 24:21.799
if that's what you're thinking.

24:21.799 --> 24:25.319
But she did mean an awful lot to me.

24:25.319 --> 24:28.160
As in, you'd grown close
over the years?

24:28.160 --> 24:32.039
Yeah. We always spent our days off
together, the pair of us,

24:32.039 --> 24:34.440
seeing the sights,
sampling the local culture.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.960
Most of the crew keep a wide berth
of the boring old sound guy,

24:37.960 --> 24:39.960
but Catrina was different.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.599
Never judged people.

24:41.599 --> 24:45.240
So, what was Catrina referring to
when she said,

24:45.240 --> 24:47.279
she "wished she'd never told you"?

24:49.160 --> 24:51.359
About a week ago,

24:51.359 --> 24:54.599
she informed me that she intended
to leave Hotspots.

24:55.799 --> 24:57.839
Like, stop presenting it, you mean?

24:59.200 --> 25:02.599
Silly old softie that I am... hadn't
taken the news

25:02.599 --> 25:05.119
particularly well.

25:05.119 --> 25:08.839
The thought of doing this
without her...

25:09.960 --> 25:14.519
Who else knew, Terry, that Catrina
had decided to leave the show?

25:14.519 --> 25:19.200
Had she told Bill Calder of her
intentions? No idea. I assume so.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.519
So, Catrina was going to quit,
which makes me wonder if Hotspots'

25:28.519 --> 25:32.039
producer was aware the star of
the show had plans to leave.

25:32.039 --> 25:33.839
We need to chase Catrina's agent.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.359
So, let me get this straight, Andre.

25:47.359 --> 25:50.039
The bottles of beer that the TV crew
drank from are going to be

25:50.039 --> 25:52.000
somewhere here.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.359
Am I right? Mm-hm.

25:54.359 --> 25:58.559
Don't fancy giving a young police
officer a hand, do you? Sorry.

25:58.559 --> 26:00.119
Well, thanks for nothing.

26:02.680 --> 26:06.480
All right, Ruby Patterson,
time to show the world

26:06.480 --> 26:08.119
what you are made of.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.279
From what I can tell, Bill Calder
can be quite the aggressor.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.200
He recently fell out with the unions
over claims he pays low wages

26:15.200 --> 26:16.880
and doesn't follow regulations.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.680
And by all accounts, he used
some pretty nasty tactics to win

26:19.680 --> 26:21.079
the case.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.960
You still haven't spoken to the
agent? He's on hold.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.720
MUSAK PLAYS

26:29.200 --> 26:31.039
Oh, that's dreadful. Who chose this?

26:31.039 --> 26:34.000
I mean, what's wrong with paying a
bit of the old Vivaldis or a

26:34.000 --> 26:35.839
nice tune, maybe?

26:35.839 --> 26:38.880
Hello. This is Jake Harrington.
Hello.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.079
PHONE RINGS
Mr Harrington, thank you for finding
a way to talk to me.

26:42.079 --> 26:44.759
Jack Mooney speaking. It's Darnell.
Darnell!

26:44.759 --> 26:48.119
How lovely to hear from you.
How's Sherman? How's Sherman?

26:49.119 --> 26:53.880
He's just dandy, yeah.
The hairy scamp could not be better.

26:53.880 --> 26:58.039
Are you sure that's what Catrina did
after she spoke to you? Positive.

26:59.599 --> 27:03.759
OK, Darnell, all the best.
Yeah, speak soon.

27:03.759 --> 27:06.200
Urgh! Seems Mrs Darnell has come
around

27:06.200 --> 27:09.599
to the idea of having an animal
in the house sooner than expected.

27:09.599 --> 27:11.960
But let's not worry about that now.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.680
So, tell me, what did the agent
have to say for himself?

27:14.680 --> 27:18.240
Six months ago, Jake Harrington
informed Bill Calder

27:18.240 --> 27:21.559
Catrina wanted to leave,
and Bill was not happy about it.

27:21.559 --> 27:23.279
He was refusing to let her go?

27:23.279 --> 27:26.480
Jake says he got pretty vicious
about it, and that's why he

27:26.480 --> 27:28.839
and Catrina spoke
the night before last.

27:28.839 --> 27:30.559
Funny how he never mentioned that.

27:32.319 --> 27:33.359
Hm.

27:33.359 --> 27:37.519
Look, all right. I admit,
I might have been somewhat selective

27:37.519 --> 27:39.400
with the truth, but, yes,

27:39.400 --> 27:43.160
Catrina came to see me that night.
Must have been after 11.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.200
She seemed tipsy.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.839
I said I thought it unwise
to talk shop if she'd been drinking,

27:48.839 --> 27:52.559
but she was adamant. So, you talked,
about her and leaving the show?

27:52.559 --> 27:55.920
Something, I don't refute,
I was very reticent to let her do.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.039
Can I ask why?

27:59.480 --> 28:03.160
Because presenters like Catrina
come along once in a blue moon.

28:03.160 --> 28:06.960
She had this very natural
girl-next-door quality about her.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.400
Makes Joe Public think
she's one of them.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.480
What did you talk about that night?

28:11.480 --> 28:14.799
I told Catrina she had a legal
commitment to film another

28:14.799 --> 28:17.960
three series,
and I expected her to honour it.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.839
She said I gave her no choice
but to break her contract and go.

28:21.839 --> 28:25.680
I promptly e-mailed my lawyers
and told them to prepare for court.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.920
But if Catrina had made up her mind,
would taking legal action

28:28.920 --> 28:30.640
really have made any difference?

28:30.640 --> 28:32.559
Probably not.

28:32.559 --> 28:34.759
We hear you can be quite the tyrant,
Bill,

28:34.759 --> 28:36.480
if you don't get what you want.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.400
Vicious, even. That's what show
business does to you.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.160
Lots of sharks swimming
about the waters.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.960
It's a case of eat or be eaten.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.000
That's an unfortunate analogy.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.240
So, what happens next?

28:50.240 --> 28:53.480
We've enough footage of Catrina
to cobble together our final

28:53.480 --> 28:56.240
episode of this series.
We'll recast for the next.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.960
You're thinking about recasting?
Already?

28:58.960 --> 29:01.440
Poor girl's only been dead 24 hours.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.440
As they say, the show must go on.

29:05.720 --> 29:09.599
Mr Calder, does the word Meridil
mean anything to you?

29:09.599 --> 29:11.119
Sorry?

29:11.119 --> 29:13.440
Meridil, it's a beta-blocker.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.079
There were large traces of it found
in Catrina's system.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.039
Never heard of the stuff.

29:20.119 --> 29:21.440
Thank you.

29:32.359 --> 29:34.119
Well, Ruby, what's the story?

29:34.119 --> 29:37.920
OK, so, Bill Calder actually ordered
and paid for all the bills,

29:37.920 --> 29:39.039
Inspector Mooney.

29:39.039 --> 29:41.720
So, in theory, Bill could have added
the Meridil to one of the

29:41.720 --> 29:43.720
beers before handing it to Catrina?

29:43.720 --> 29:46.319
So, take me through
what you've found.

29:46.319 --> 29:48.599
So, the crew drank Palm Tree beers.

29:48.599 --> 29:51.799
So, I started by separating out
the bottles with that label on it.

29:51.799 --> 29:55.000
I then dusted those very same
bottles for fingerprints and

29:55.000 --> 29:58.759
separated them out into three
further groupings - ones with

29:58.759 --> 30:02.559
no prints belonging to our suspects,
ones with one set of suspect

30:02.559 --> 30:06.079
prints on them, and ones with more
than one set of suspect prints on.

30:06.079 --> 30:08.160
Excellent work. So, which pile is
which?

30:09.799 --> 30:11.119
Well, er...

30:12.839 --> 30:14.440
I think, um...

30:14.440 --> 30:17.519
You've forgotten, haven't you? No.

30:17.519 --> 30:20.519
I mean, yes. Urgh!

30:20.519 --> 30:24.240
I knew I should have labelled
the piles. Not to worry.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.279
Let's work out which is which. Won't
take us long together.

30:27.279 --> 30:29.279
And then you can get them
off to the lab.

30:29.279 --> 30:33.559
So, Ruby, would I be right in saying
that remembering things is

30:33.559 --> 30:35.119
not one of your strong points?

30:35.119 --> 30:38.680
You just noticed! It's, like, my one
flaw as a human being.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.839
You know people say they have
memories like a sieve?

30:41.839 --> 30:44.519
Well, mine's like a bucket -
a bottomless one.

30:47.839 --> 30:51.559
So, this fella, Bill Calder,
he leaps to the top of the

30:51.559 --> 30:54.480
leaderboard to become
prime suspect numero uno.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.440
Because, one, he has a motive.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.599
Catrina was desperate to leave
Hotspots and Bill's a ruthless man,

30:59.599 --> 31:02.200
who hates not getting his own way.
Yeah, and we know it's been

31:02.200 --> 31:04.880
a gruelling couple of months
travelling together.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.759
So Catrina's decision to quit could
have just tipped him over the edge.

31:07.759 --> 31:11.079
Mm-hm. Number two, when we asked him
if he heard of Meridil,

31:11.079 --> 31:13.160
you know, he was acting very shifty.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.799
He certainly was, yes.

31:14.799 --> 31:18.279
Number three, Bill Calder ordered
the beers for the crew drinks,

31:18.279 --> 31:21.400
which is when he could have poisoned
Catrina with the Meridil.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.759
Except...same problem exists.

31:24.759 --> 31:28.359
If he drugged Catrina's beer down
at the bar earlier that evening...

31:28.359 --> 31:30.720
How could he then predict
she would go for an entirely

31:30.720 --> 31:33.720
spontaneous swim in the sea
a few hours later?

31:33.720 --> 31:36.119
COMPUTER BEEPS
Because the truth is, if she didn't

31:36.119 --> 31:38.599
go for that swim, then she never
would have drowned.

31:41.119 --> 31:44.519
Ah, sir. Your results are back for
the glass and the wine bottle in

31:44.519 --> 31:45.960
Catrina's room.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.359
Ah - no traces of Meridil in either.

31:48.359 --> 31:51.559
So, the drug must have been
administered in the crew drinks.

31:51.559 --> 31:53.759
Well, the bottles have gone to the
lab,

31:53.759 --> 31:56.480
so I guess we'll find out
in the morning. Until then,

31:56.480 --> 31:58.039
let's call it a day. Yes, sir.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.640
All right.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.920
OK. Night, sir. What are you doing
with all that stuff?

32:06.920 --> 32:09.039
I thought I'd take them home
to work on.

32:09.039 --> 32:11.799
How about we divvy it up
and do it over a beer at my place?

32:11.799 --> 32:14.640
If you're sure, sir. Thank you.
Grand.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.680
Hey, it's Pippa.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.480
Have you heard the news?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.359
I know - it's awful.

32:30.359 --> 32:32.079
TOTALLY unexpected.

32:33.759 --> 32:37.680
Not to sound cold-hearted,
but it does present us with

32:37.680 --> 32:41.200
something of an opportunity,
don't you think?

32:44.559 --> 32:46.440
KNOCK AT DOOR

32:46.440 --> 32:51.119
JP! Perfect timing. Give us a hand
here, would you? Have some eggs.

32:52.640 --> 32:56.759
Why so many eggs, sir? That's how
I'm going to recapture Sherman.

32:56.759 --> 32:58.839
Don't know if I ever mentioned it,

32:58.839 --> 33:01.920
but, you see,
I'm something of an amateur trapper.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.599
Sure I'd remember if you had, sir.

33:03.599 --> 33:07.079
Growing up, my uncle Terence used to
have a farm just outside Clonakilty.

33:07.079 --> 33:09.119
Place was rife with wood pigeons.

33:09.119 --> 33:11.960
Many's a weekend we spent ensnaring
the little beggars.

33:14.119 --> 33:17.799
With the wood pigeons, we used to
scatter seeds on the ground as bait.

33:17.799 --> 33:21.079
So, I called the vet and I asked
him, "What would Sherman like?"

33:21.079 --> 33:23.240
And he said, "Hard-boiled eggs"?

33:23.240 --> 33:26.559
They go weak at the knees,
apparently. Oh, yeah.

33:28.160 --> 33:32.400
If all goes to plan, the eggy waft
will lure Sherman back and

33:32.400 --> 33:36.319
he won't be able to resist snaffling
them up, which will lead him

33:36.319 --> 33:40.279
to that basket there.
At which point, we pull the stick,

33:40.279 --> 33:43.279
the basket falls, and our rogue
beast

33:43.279 --> 33:46.000
is thus rendered incapacitated.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.440
So, what do we do now, sir?
We wait, JP, we wait.

33:52.119 --> 33:54.799
CATRINA: And stay tuned,
as we're giving away

33:54.799 --> 33:57.240
an all-expenses paid trip
to Saint Marie

33:57.240 --> 33:59.400
in this week's competition.

33:59.400 --> 34:03.519
Perfect, Catrina. Keep rolling,
I want some GVs of the beach.

34:04.559 --> 34:07.279
Find anything more on the footage
yet, sir?

34:07.279 --> 34:09.280
Nothing we hadn't picked up on
before.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.360
I'll tell you one thing it's made me
realise - never believe

34:12.360 --> 34:13.760
anything you see on the telly, JP.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.400
Why's that? Every shot,
Catrina has a big, broad smile.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.199
She looks happy as Larry.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.280
And you don't think that's the case?

34:21.280 --> 34:25.400
Well, in my book, people who are
content in life don't end up drunk

34:25.400 --> 34:28.518
on a beach in the middle of the
night with someone else's husband.

34:28.518 --> 34:31.800
Doesn't quite fit with what we know
about Catrina so far, does it?

34:32.880 --> 34:34.320
I think Catrina was lonely.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.880
JP, wake up!

34:58.159 --> 35:01.039
Sherman must have waited for us
to fall asleep,

35:01.039 --> 35:04.760
seized his opportunity, the devious
little... But, sir, that's good.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.599
That means the plan can work.
Sherman took the bait.

35:08.599 --> 35:12.199
You're right, JP. The only mistake
we made was to fall asleep.

35:12.199 --> 35:16.400
Tonight, Sherman,
it's game over.

35:19.039 --> 35:23.000
OK. So, the lab have come back with
the results on the beer bottles

35:23.000 --> 35:26.320
from the crew drinks, and there's no
traces of Meridil

35:26.320 --> 35:29.960
in any of them whatsoever.
None at all? None at all, sir.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.239
Well, then, how did the killer get
the drugs into Catrina's system?

35:33.239 --> 35:37.840
What about Bill's accounts? Any sign
of a regular payment for Meridil?

35:37.840 --> 35:41.480
There was a recurring payment on his
debit card to a pharmacy in Bristol,

35:41.480 --> 35:43.119
but I called them
and they just said,

35:43.119 --> 35:44.760
"It's confidential information."

35:44.760 --> 35:47.519
And I've gone through the suspect's
phone records and, again,

35:47.519 --> 35:51.440
nothing suspicious.
So, that's it? We've nothing else.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.159
Well, there was one other thing,
sir.

35:54.159 --> 35:57.199
I was going through Catrina's old
e-mails and I found her first

35:57.199 --> 35:58.519
contract for Hotspots.

35:58.519 --> 36:03.000
It commenced in June 2013, but then
I remembered that the pilot was

36:03.000 --> 36:05.199
filmed in 2012.

36:05.199 --> 36:07.400
Made the Hotspots pilot in 2012.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.039
Since then,
there have been 12 series.

36:10.039 --> 36:12.960
So, Catrina didn't host the pilot.

36:14.719 --> 36:18.440
How much do you want to bet some fan
has uploaded the pilot episode
online?

36:18.440 --> 36:20.719
Oh, OK.

36:20.719 --> 36:22.320
Right.

36:26.239 --> 36:29.880
Here we are, Hotspots pilot,
circa 2012.

36:29.880 --> 36:34.039
Hello and welcome to the very first
edition of Hotspots...

36:34.039 --> 36:36.920
Oh, my goodness! It's Pippa Mayhew!

36:36.920 --> 36:42.519
..and we're in the beautiful
and bustling city of Marrakech.

36:42.519 --> 36:44.559
So, Hotspots' production coordinator

36:44.559 --> 36:47.719
once had aspirations to be in
front of the camera herself.

36:47.719 --> 36:51.159
So, maybe Pippa was jealous that
Catrina got the job.

36:51.159 --> 36:54.000
But this was seven years ago.
Surely she'd be over that by now?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.440
Excuse me, sir.

37:00.079 --> 37:01.239
PBA Entertainment.

37:01.239 --> 37:04.639
Personal management for celebrity
singers and presenters.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.280
So, just as Pippa was thinking

37:06.280 --> 37:08.760
about getting back into presenting
again...

37:08.760 --> 37:12.199
Hotspots is suddenly in need
of a new host.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.519
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer

37:16.519 --> 37:18.400
to do this somewhere a bit more
private?

37:18.400 --> 37:20.480
Why? I've nothing to hide. Thanks.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.199
You enjoy the public gaze,
would you say, Pippa?

37:23.199 --> 37:25.800
That's rather a loaded question,
Inspector.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.440
We stumbled across the Hotspots
pilot you shot a few years ago.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.840
Oh, gosh. Not my finest hour,
by any means.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.960
But it's something you want
to pursue still? Oh, Lord, no.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.840
All that attention,
I can't imagine anything worse.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.360
We know you're lying to us, Pippa.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.519
We found your agent's website
and we gave him a call.

37:44.519 --> 37:46.400
Not been going brilliantly,
has it,

37:46.400 --> 37:49.119
since you dipped your toe back
in the old presenting pool?

37:51.559 --> 37:53.639
I'm too old, apparently.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.760
There's something very wrong
in the world when 38 is considered

37:56.760 --> 37:58.400
past it, don't you think?

37:59.400 --> 38:02.440
And what about Hotspots? Is there a
chance you could take over?

38:02.440 --> 38:04.880
Well, as the network didn't want me
first time round,

38:04.880 --> 38:07.920
I think it's very unlikely
they'll feel differently now.

38:09.159 --> 38:13.079
It looked like you were about to say
"but" there - am I right, Pippa?

38:13.079 --> 38:17.440
Bill said he was willing to give me
a screen test - put me on camera.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.159
He offered to do that?

38:19.159 --> 38:21.760
I asked him to, and he said yes.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.599
Look, I'm nudging 40,

38:26.599 --> 38:31.719
single, no children, and all because
I've spent the last 15 years doing

38:31.719 --> 38:35.719
a job in which I spend more time
abroad than I do in my own home.

38:35.719 --> 38:38.880
I deserve so much more for
what I've sacrificed.

38:38.880 --> 38:43.119
And you'd do anything to get it?
Murder, you mean?

38:43.119 --> 38:48.760
I'm ambitious, Inspector,
not ruthless. There's a difference.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.360
Thank you for your time. Thank you.

38:59.599 --> 39:02.800
In theory, Pippa does have motive.

39:02.800 --> 39:07.119
Mm - would she really kill Catrina
after all these years? Exactly.

39:07.119 --> 39:09.480
It's like Terry Brownlow
and Andy Spriggs -

39:09.480 --> 39:12.480
it just doesn't feel strong enough.
Which leaves us with Bill Calder,

39:12.480 --> 39:14.679
front and centre
as the strongest suspect.

39:14.679 --> 39:17.639
He has motive, he was suspicious
when we asked him about the Meridil.

39:17.639 --> 39:19.400
Sir, I think that's the police bike.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.679
Look!

39:22.000 --> 39:23.519
Is that Ruby driving it?

39:28.840 --> 39:31.559
Ruby. What are you doing here?

39:31.559 --> 39:34.400
Since when did you learn
how to ride a motorbike?

39:34.400 --> 39:37.840
I'm here because something's come
through that I thought you might

39:37.840 --> 39:39.280
want to see straight away,

39:39.280 --> 39:43.000
and I learned to ride a bike when I
was 12, my uncle Selwyn taught me.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.039
So, what's the important thing? The
final full postmortem has arrived.

39:47.039 --> 39:48.440
OK.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.280
Don't tell us you forgot it, Ruby.
OK, not to worry.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.440
We'll just have to head back
to the station.

39:59.440 --> 40:03.039
Wait, let me try to remember
why it was important.

40:03.039 --> 40:04.280
Ruby...

40:04.280 --> 40:06.360
Just let me concentrate.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.239
Black coffee. Sorry? Black coffee?

40:13.239 --> 40:16.800
As well as the beer and wine Catrina
drunk, there was also fresh,

40:16.800 --> 40:19.719
black, filtered coffee
found in Catrina's stomach.

40:19.719 --> 40:22.840
So, maybe that's
what contained the Meridil.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.320
I want to see a copy of
everyone's room bill.

40:34.039 --> 40:38.559
Here, fresh filter coffee. Who
ordered it? Bill Calder, no less.

40:38.559 --> 40:41.119
10:45pm, the same night
Catrina was killed,

40:41.119 --> 40:43.960
he ordered room service - chicken
sandwich, mineral water

40:43.960 --> 40:45.280
and a fresh coffee for one.

40:45.280 --> 40:48.320
Sir, that's 15 minutes before
Catrina went to see him.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.800
Yes, Catrina came to see me that
night. Must've been after 11.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.719
It was Bill Calder who murdered
Catrina, wasn't it,

40:54.719 --> 40:55.760
Inspector Mooney?

40:58.239 --> 41:00.360
Bill?

41:00.360 --> 41:04.000
Bill, are you in there?
You OK, Pippa?

41:04.000 --> 41:09.119
It's Bill, he's not answering,
and I can hear water running in

41:09.119 --> 41:11.880
there, and I'm worried
he's had an accident.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.239
Bill...?

41:14.840 --> 41:18.760
Excuse me.
Could you open this room? Sure.

41:18.760 --> 41:21.119
We're worried our friend might
have hurt himself.

41:26.719 --> 41:28.280
Oh, God.

41:31.079 --> 41:35.159
I can't believe he'd do this. He's
taken an overdose.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.960
What's going on?

41:36.960 --> 41:40.559
JP, call an ambulance. Sir.
It's too late, he's already...

41:40.559 --> 41:41.840
Bill, what have you done?

41:44.719 --> 41:46.599
This is how you found him?

41:46.599 --> 41:49.519
What's happened? ..No!

41:49.519 --> 41:53.239
Is he...? I'm afraid we need
to clear the scene. Ruby, could you

41:53.239 --> 41:57.639
take everyone into the corridor?
Please, come with me.

41:57.639 --> 41:59.480
It's OK.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.320
Ambulance is on the way, sir.

42:12.480 --> 42:16.400
So, Bill was prescribed Meridil.
It's as good as a confession.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.239
Bill was either racked with guilt
or scared the net was closing in,

42:20.239 --> 42:21.920
maybe a bit of both.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.199
Either way, we know it was him
that killed Catrina.

42:24.199 --> 42:27.199
And then killed himself.
Let's seal the room.

42:27.199 --> 42:28.960
I'll phone the Commissioner. Sir.

42:45.599 --> 42:49.320
KNOCK AT DOOR
Can I come in, sir? Course.

42:49.320 --> 42:52.880
What are you doing here?
I owe you for last night.

42:52.880 --> 42:56.280
And I've got a feeling that you're
not entirely sure that

42:56.280 --> 42:58.199
we solved the case.

42:58.199 --> 43:00.840
Well, in theory, everything adds up.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.480
But we still can't be sure
how Bill Calder knew that Catrina

43:03.480 --> 43:06.320
would choose to go for a swim
that night and, if he didn't know,

43:06.320 --> 43:08.639
how could he be sure
she'd pass out and drown?

43:08.639 --> 43:11.079
So, what do you think we should do
now, sir?

43:11.079 --> 43:14.159
Bound to be something we're missing
here, we just have to find it. Yeah.

43:15.559 --> 43:18.320
LIGHT SCRATCHY FOOTSTEPS

43:18.320 --> 43:19.719
Sherman!

43:51.480 --> 43:53.079
Bingo!

43:55.320 --> 43:57.360
I knew it would work!

43:59.199 --> 44:02.440
JP, he's getting away! Quick!

44:06.639 --> 44:08.719
Well done, Sherman!

44:08.719 --> 44:10.480
You win.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.360
I surrender!

44:19.599 --> 44:25.360
There you go, Uncle Selly. Right to
the front door. Thank you, Ruby.

44:25.360 --> 44:29.559
Maybe, in the future,
go a little easy on corners.

44:29.559 --> 44:35.000
I wouldn't want you to have an
accident. Understood. OK.

44:37.119 --> 44:42.760
Yoo-hoo! Look who I brought with me.
It's Commissioner Patterson.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.840
With respect, Inspector,

44:44.840 --> 44:46.400
you look terrible.

44:47.559 --> 44:50.239
Can't deny, something
of a tough night.

44:50.239 --> 44:52.920
I was under the impression
you'd already solved the case.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.199
We have, and we haven't, sir.

44:56.280 --> 45:00.719
I mean, all the evidence points to
Bill Calder, but one inconsistency.

45:00.719 --> 45:04.119
How did he manage to predict that
Catrina McVey would then go for

45:04.119 --> 45:08.280
a swim, when even SHE didn't know
that's what she was going to do?

45:08.280 --> 45:10.719
That's the only thing stopping me
signing off on the case, sir.

45:10.719 --> 45:13.079
Why don't I make a cup of tea?
I mean, that's got to help.

45:13.079 --> 45:17.440
Good idea, Ruby. I'll just get some
air. Will you give me a minute?

45:38.360 --> 45:40.480
Well, blow me down with a feather.

45:43.679 --> 45:45.920
Here you go, sir.

45:48.559 --> 45:52.239
It's Sherman's boiled egg. It is.
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

45:52.239 --> 45:54.920
It WAS his boiled egg but isn't any
more, cos it's me that's

45:54.920 --> 45:58.000
eating it now. There's nothing the
little fella can do about it,

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
nothing at all. I mean, it's
obvious, when you think about it -

46:02.000 --> 46:05.119
a simple case of one man eating
another man's eggs.

46:06.960 --> 46:10.519
Catrina's decision to go
for a midnight dip was spontaneous.

46:10.519 --> 46:14.400
Fresh filter coffee. Who ordered it?
Bill Calder no less.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.480
So, Bill was prescribed Meridil.
It's as good as a confession.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.639
Catrina and me, we've been working
on this show since the

46:22.639 --> 46:24.360
beginning, we're old friends.

46:24.360 --> 46:27.280
From what I can tell, Bill Calder
can be quite the aggressor.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.480
Catrina's death was just a tragic
accident.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.159
I was right.

46:32.159 --> 46:35.079
It all comes down to understanding
how Bill Calder knew that

46:35.079 --> 46:37.760
Catrina was going to go for the swim
the night she was killed.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.280
And now you know, sir.

46:39.280 --> 46:42.800
I do, but he didn't - and that's
the key to it, JP, that's the key.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.719
And you're sure this time
you've actually solved the case.

46:45.719 --> 46:49.119
Absolutely positive, sir. Ruby,
I need you to get to the station,

46:49.119 --> 46:51.639
get a hold of all the room bills
for all the hotels that Bill and

46:51.639 --> 46:53.920
his team stayed at prior
to Saint Marie.

46:53.920 --> 46:56.480
Anything you want me to do, sir?
Just gather up the suspects -

46:56.480 --> 46:58.159
we've got a killer to arrest.

46:59.159 --> 47:00.679
Commissioner.

47:05.039 --> 47:09.519
The great Irish writer, Brendon
Behan, he once said, "At the heart

47:09.519 --> 47:14.360
"of all loneliness is a yearning
for union with one's lost self."

47:15.960 --> 47:19.519
And I think that's close to what
Catrina was feeling when she walked

47:19.519 --> 47:22.159
into the sea on that fateful night.

47:22.159 --> 47:23.880
She was lost in life.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.679
Alone in the world,

47:25.679 --> 47:28.599
searching for the happier person
that she used to be.

47:29.599 --> 47:31.960
And who can blame her
for feeling that way?

47:33.119 --> 47:36.400
She had a boss who was going out of
his way to stop her taking a

47:36.400 --> 47:40.440
new job, her production coordinator
was desperate to steal the job that

47:40.440 --> 47:44.599
she had, a cameraman that she was
going to for a bit of affection, and

47:44.599 --> 47:48.719
he cared more about protecting his
own marriage than he did about her.

47:48.719 --> 47:52.000
The one exception in all this is
you, Terry.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.679
You were a true friend to Catrina
to the very end,

47:54.679 --> 47:58.280
the only one I'd say who
was actually looking out for her.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.920
Thank you.
So, which one of you did it?

48:00.920 --> 48:05.119
Which one of you killed Catrina
McVey and then also murdered

48:05.119 --> 48:06.719
Bill Calder?

48:07.800 --> 48:10.920
I suggest we deal with
these two murders chronologically.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.679
Three nights ago,
at ten o'clock in the evening,

48:14.679 --> 48:17.280
Catrina McVey returned
back to her room.

48:17.280 --> 48:20.400
She poured herself a glass of wine,
called her agent,

48:20.400 --> 48:24.039
and then she crossed the corridor
to speak with Bill Calder about

48:24.039 --> 48:26.760
the fact she wanted
to leave Hotspots.

48:26.760 --> 48:30.719
We know Catrina was tipsy from the
bottle of wine and the beer

48:30.719 --> 48:32.239
she'd had down at the bar.

48:32.239 --> 48:35.039
So, Bill, who'd already ordered
himself some fresh coffee,

48:35.039 --> 48:38.360
poured one for Catrina
to help clear her head.

48:38.360 --> 48:42.239
But what Catrina didn't realise is
that there was a large amount of

48:42.239 --> 48:44.760
crushed Meridil in that coffee.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.280
Meridil?

48:46.280 --> 48:47.480
It's a beta-blocker,

48:47.480 --> 48:50.880
prescribed to Bill for his heart -
and the effect of that drug,

48:50.880 --> 48:54.000
mixed with the alcohol,
led to Catrina to pass out in the

48:54.000 --> 48:57.519
water when she subsequently went
for a midnight swim with Andrew.

48:59.239 --> 49:03.000
But the thing is, it wasn't just
Catrina who was unaware that

49:03.000 --> 49:05.239
the coffee she drank contained
Meridil.

49:05.239 --> 49:07.440
Bill Calder didn't know it was there
either.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.400
That is because it was Bill Calder

49:09.400 --> 49:12.280
our murderer was intending
to kill - not Catrina.

49:12.280 --> 49:15.719
Bill ordered the coffee,
he was supposed to drink it.

49:15.719 --> 49:17.920
You mean, it WAS an accident?

49:17.920 --> 49:20.480
It was Bill Calder who was supposed
to die that night.

49:20.480 --> 49:23.280
If he drank that coffee and ingested
the large amount of Meridil,

49:23.280 --> 49:25.639
well, then that,
on top of his normal intake,

49:25.639 --> 49:28.679
it would have caused an overdose,
resulting in cardiac arrest...

49:28.679 --> 49:31.199
Which at his age,
and with pre-existing heart disease,

49:31.199 --> 49:33.920
would just have been assumed
as death by natural causes.

49:33.920 --> 49:36.400
In fact, murder would never
have been suspected.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.840
Clever plan, except for one thing -
it went wrong.

49:39.840 --> 49:45.320
Catrina drank the coffee instead of
Bill. Oh, God. It's just awful.

49:45.320 --> 49:49.320
It is. It's terrible,

49:49.320 --> 49:51.119
isn't it,

49:51.119 --> 49:52.719
Terry?

49:55.760 --> 49:57.960
You can't think I did it.

49:57.960 --> 50:01.119
I don't THINK it, Terry,
I KNOW you did.

50:01.119 --> 50:04.599
We've checked Bill's previous hotel
bills, we know he always ordered

50:04.599 --> 50:07.960
room service of a night, some food
and mineral water and a coffee.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.400
Now, you've worked with Bill for a
very long time now,

50:10.400 --> 50:12.440
you knew his routine. And three
nights ago,

50:12.440 --> 50:15.760
intending to give Bill an overdose
of Meridil, you waited for his order

50:15.760 --> 50:19.960
to arrive and then, we assume, you
went and visited his room yourself.

50:19.960 --> 50:23.440
Now, I don't know what you talked
about. It doesn't really matter.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.800
One thing's for certain.
When you were inside that room,

50:26.800 --> 50:30.079
you made sure that Bill left you
alone for a moment, and that's

50:30.079 --> 50:32.360
when you added the crushed Meridil
to the coffee.

50:32.360 --> 50:36.039
Now, we're waiting to hear back, but
we've contacted your mother's GP.

50:36.039 --> 50:38.159
She passed away recently,
God rest her.

50:38.159 --> 50:40.719
But, if she had heart problems,
I wonder,

50:40.719 --> 50:42.599
was she prescribed Meridil as well?

50:45.920 --> 50:49.079
That was your plan -
give Bill an overdose.

50:50.519 --> 50:53.320
Except, a few minutes after
you left Bill's room,

50:53.320 --> 50:56.639
what you didn't realise is
that Catrina went to see him.

50:56.639 --> 51:01.000
I didn't mean to hurt her!
I know, but that is what happened.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.320
You unwittingly killed her.

51:03.320 --> 51:06.920
Then, as a result, you felt the need
to kill Bill Calder and stage

51:06.920 --> 51:08.880
his death to look like a suicide.

51:10.280 --> 51:13.159
Suicide would be a statement
of guilt

51:13.159 --> 51:15.000
that Bill was Catrina's killer.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.159
He couldn't live with what
he'd done.

51:17.159 --> 51:19.679
And if we believed that Bill was
Catrina's killer,

51:19.679 --> 51:22.199
then you, Terry Brownlow,
walked away scot-free.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.159
So, how did he do it?

51:25.159 --> 51:28.079
How did Terry murder Bill,
make it look like a suicide?

51:28.079 --> 51:32.119
Yesterday morning, you came
to see Bill - to "talk to him".

51:32.119 --> 51:34.039
As soon as you had a moment alone,

51:34.039 --> 51:37.760
you deposited a large amount of the
drugs in the drink.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.920
On top of his normal dosage,
wouldn't take long for the effect to

51:40.920 --> 51:43.039
take hold and for Bill to die.

51:43.039 --> 51:46.000
Terry then staged the scene to make
it look like Bill had taken

51:46.000 --> 51:47.360
his own life,

51:47.360 --> 51:50.760
placed Bill's body on the bathroom
floor with a glass of water,

51:50.760 --> 51:55.679
the empty Meridil packets...and
then left the room.

51:57.079 --> 51:59.679
So, Pippa, when you came along,
calling for Bill,

51:59.679 --> 52:03.079
worrying about him, Terry was there
waiting, ready to help.

52:03.079 --> 52:07.480
OK, Pippa? But why would he want
to kill Bill in the first place?

52:07.480 --> 52:11.039
Well, I think
it comes back to loneliness.

52:11.039 --> 52:12.880
Terry, by his own admission,

52:12.880 --> 52:16.039
didn't have very many people
he connected with in life.

52:16.039 --> 52:17.559
But Catrina was different.

52:17.559 --> 52:21.119
She was the first person
in a very long time, perhaps ever,

52:21.119 --> 52:24.559
Terry genuinely bonded with,
cared for.

52:24.559 --> 52:28.280
Catrina was different,
never judged people.

52:28.280 --> 52:31.559
It had become more than a
friendship to you, hadn't it?

52:33.039 --> 52:37.199
You loved her - not in a romantic
sense, but as a father would,

52:37.199 --> 52:39.280
am I right?

52:39.280 --> 52:41.719
She was everything to me.

52:41.719 --> 52:43.239
And like any caring parent,

52:43.239 --> 52:47.079
who only wants what's best for their
children, it upset and angered

52:47.079 --> 52:50.760
you, that Catrina's dream job was
being denied to her by Bill Calder.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.920
She decided to give in to him,
not break her contract, film

52:53.920 --> 52:58.280
another three series, that's what we
were talking about that afternoon.

52:58.280 --> 53:01.440
I should never have told you
about it - I wish I hadn't.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.239
I'm glad you did, it's just...

53:03.239 --> 53:06.159
What you didn't realise is
that Catrina had changed her mind.

53:06.159 --> 53:08.599
She spoke to her agent,
decided to confront Bill,

53:08.599 --> 53:11.599
tell him she WAS leaving the show.
But, unaware of this,

53:11.599 --> 53:15.400
you proceeded with the plan that you
already had in place - to get rid

53:15.400 --> 53:18.800
of the man who was denying Catrina
her dreams - to murder Bill Calder.

53:18.800 --> 53:22.480
Now, you said that Catrina only
told you on this trip that she

53:22.480 --> 53:24.239
wanted to leave Hotspots.

53:24.239 --> 53:27.400
But you already knew that was
the case before you left,

53:27.400 --> 53:28.960
three months ago. That's right.

53:28.960 --> 53:32.039
Because you brought your mother's
old Meridil tablets with you.

53:32.039 --> 53:35.599
You'd already realised that taking
Bill's life might be the only

53:35.599 --> 53:38.480
solution here. We know you didn't
much like the man.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.960
Officially speaking, we should have
all been paid overtime.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.679
Not now, Terry, old chap.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.679
So, the thought of murder,

53:46.679 --> 53:49.719
I don't think it caused you
too much trouble at all.

53:49.719 --> 53:52.920
Not if it meant helping the young
woman that you'd grown to

53:52.920 --> 53:57.079
care about more than anything else
in the world to achieve her dreams.

53:58.559 --> 54:00.159
Night, Terry.

54:01.960 --> 54:05.679
You might well have got away with it
if Catrina hadn't crossed the

54:05.679 --> 54:09.360
corridor that night
and knocked on Bill Calder's door.

54:17.119 --> 54:18.559
You can make the arrest.

54:50.239 --> 54:53.800
Oh! You managed to catch him, sir.
Course not!

54:53.800 --> 54:56.280
But I called the vet
again and I asked him,

54:56.280 --> 54:59.639
did he know of anyone had
a polecat/mongoose/ferret?

54:59.639 --> 55:04.280
So, let me introduce you to Sherman
Mk 2. But, sir, won't Darnell

55:04.280 --> 55:06.599
notice he's a different animal?

55:06.599 --> 55:10.599
I doubt it! Damn thing wasn't even
his pet to begin with.

55:10.599 --> 55:13.719
Honestly, Darnell will be none the
wiser.

55:15.039 --> 55:18.280
Ah, look who it is!
She misses the entire investigation

55:18.280 --> 55:20.599
and turns up just in time for
the beers!

55:20.599 --> 55:24.679
Welcome back, Sarge!
Thank you. So, how was it?

55:24.679 --> 55:26.239
Oh, it was beautiful, wasn't it?

55:26.239 --> 55:30.280
Yeah, we went for massages,
swam in the sea, lay in the sun.

55:30.280 --> 55:32.559
Stuffed our faces with food,

55:32.559 --> 55:35.119
and we got engaged. Sorry, you...?

55:35.119 --> 55:37.599
Yeah, we got engaged. Wow!

55:37.599 --> 55:42.679
That's fantastic news -
fantastic! Congratulations, Sarge!

55:42.679 --> 55:46.440
Thank you.
That's, like, the best news ever!

55:48.599 --> 55:51.639
Call me old-fashioned, but I'd say
that calls for a round of the

55:51.639 --> 55:54.960
finest rum punch money can buy.
I'll come with you, sir.

55:57.239 --> 56:01.719
So, Detective Sergeant Cassell,
congratulations. I mean it.

56:01.719 --> 56:03.440
Thank you, sir.

56:03.440 --> 56:06.239
You know, finding someone
you want to share the rest of your

56:06.239 --> 56:10.000
life with is just about the best
thing that can happen to a person.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
You don't want to be alone.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.280
I'm made up for you.

56:14.480 --> 56:18.920
I'm not so sure Inspector Mooney
should use this Sherman to

56:18.920 --> 56:20.599
replace the old one.

56:20.599 --> 56:23.920
Why's that, Ruby? Because this
Sherman, well...

56:25.159 --> 56:27.360
He's a she. What?

56:36.519 --> 56:38.119
You know what?

56:38.119 --> 56:40.159
The inspector's had a long few days.

56:40.159 --> 56:44.639
Let's just hold off on breaking the
news to him just yet, hm?

56:46.119 --> 56:48.480
Hey! Here we are.

56:48.480 --> 56:51.400
Celebration! Get this into you.

56:56.719 --> 56:59.920
OK, to Sherman!
Here's to the happy couple.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.079
ALL: Cheers!

57:03.960 --> 57:07.519
Dad would have been proud I kept his
dream alive for so long.

57:07.519 --> 57:09.880
To Paradise Skies. Paradise Skies.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.639
Dad wouldn't have been proud of
you -

57:11.639 --> 57:13.440
he'd have killed you for doing this.

57:13.440 --> 57:17.239
Benedict, no! Benedict Dacre,
sir - the coffee king.

57:17.239 --> 57:18.639
Inspector, look at me.

57:18.639 --> 57:21.519
I did not kill my husband.

57:21.519 --> 57:24.239
They want...they want me to go to
prison, don't they?

57:24.239 --> 57:25.719
What do you know about crabs?

57:25.719 --> 57:29.119
SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT
Yes, yes, yes!
