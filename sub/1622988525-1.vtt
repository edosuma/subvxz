WEBVTT

01:17.120 --> 01:21.516
RINGO: In a five-year period,
19,000 bank robberies
were reported to the FBI.

01:24.562 --> 01:27.391
So, that means there were
19,000 bank robbers

01:27.478 --> 01:29.132
who didn'’t do
their job correctly.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.092
Who wants the FBI on their ass?

01:34.137 --> 01:38.924
Nah, man. I say, if you gonna
rob a bank, make sure
it ain'’t reported.

01:43.059 --> 01:45.583
Funny thing about
safe deposit boxes...

01:47.368 --> 01:49.500
ain'’t nothing safe about them.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.040
RINGO: None of the shit
in the boxes is insured.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.739
Try reporting a loss to
the bank or the government,

02:11.566 --> 02:13.611
you'’ll get the middle finger
in fine print.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.269
So who would use
a safe deposit box?

02:20.183 --> 02:21.141
Stupid people.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.056
And criminals.

02:24.622 --> 02:27.103
Now, I ain'’t got no problem
with stupid people,

02:27.321 --> 02:29.888
as long as their stupidity
don'’t hurt nobody.

02:31.803 --> 02:35.111
The owner of box 2504
is a deadbeat dad

02:35.198 --> 02:38.114
who hides his income
so he doesn'’t have to pay
child support.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.248
How you gonna do that
to your own kid?

02:42.336 --> 02:46.166
Let me be clear.
I never steal from people
who don'’t deserve it.

02:47.384 --> 02:51.475
And what I steal,
always goes back to those
who'’ve been harmed.

02:53.477 --> 02:56.959
That handsome black man?
Yeah, that'’s me. Ringo.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.092
Yeah, Ringo, like the Beatle.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.052
And don'’t start with that
John, Paul, George shit,

03:03.139 --> 03:05.185
'’cause I ain't got time
to get into it.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.405
What you need to pay attention
to is my masterful disguise.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.060
I'’m a black chameleon, baby.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.109
And I'’m empty-handed.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.070
RINGO: '’Cause when those
a-holes discover
their boxes are empty,

03:21.679 --> 03:22.724
they'’ll get pissed.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.035
RINGO: They'’ll yell
at the bank manager,

03:30.253 --> 03:32.951
the bank manager
might even let him see
the security footage,

03:35.040 --> 03:39.784
but he will also explain
what I already told you--
That shit ain'’t insured.

03:40.872 --> 03:44.528
One thing they will not do
is report it to the FBI,

03:44.659 --> 03:47.139
'’cause roaches hide
from the light.

03:52.754 --> 03:58.238
RINGO: And in about six months,
I'’ll empty my safe deposit
box and close my account.

04:02.024 --> 04:05.897
And I will write
a few wrongs, anonymously.

04:07.159 --> 04:10.424
Oh my God, David,
pack your things!

04:10.511 --> 04:14.776
RINGO: Turns out I'’m not
the only one who feels
good about doing good.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.735
That little dude,
his name is Wick.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.784
As a kid he heard
some Chinese story

04:22.914 --> 04:25.221
about firecrackers scaring
away evil spirits.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.531
There'’s two things you need
to know about Wick.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.446
First off...

04:34.186 --> 04:35.449
He don'’t give up.

04:36.711 --> 04:40.889
And eventually he got really
good at blowing shit up.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.590
RINGO: Dude made a mint in Vegas
when they decided to remodel
the whole city.

04:47.330 --> 04:51.160
Second, he'’s still the same
kid I first told you about.

04:51.552 --> 04:56.992
He'’s still goofy as hell,
still has the same haircut,
still looks like he'’s 12--

04:57.079 --> 05:01.213
and he still believes
firecrackers can chase away
evil spirits.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.738
This was a drug
manufacturing plant.

05:04.086 --> 05:07.394
Wick made sure no drugs
would ever come out
of here again.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.309
Now I wasn'’t there,

05:09.526 --> 05:11.702
but I think it went a little
something like this.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.428
RINGO: That there is Violet.

05:42.907 --> 05:46.650
Right now she in a church
in some shitty
Eastern Euro country.

05:48.696 --> 05:52.700
She just recently freed
a bunch of young girls
from a sex trafficking ring.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.009
And those are some
shitty Eastern Euro thugs

05:58.096 --> 06:03.188
who are about to join a long
list of men who underestimated
Violet'’s girl power.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.996
RINGO: Yo, it was like some
Matrix-style shit.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.782
Now I ain'’t saying she
defied gravity or anything,

06:33.567 --> 06:35.133
'’cause I wasn't there.

06:35.351 --> 06:39.137
But I do know only
one person walked
out of there that day.

06:44.316 --> 06:46.884
RINGO: About a year ago,
we didn'’t know each other.

06:47.232 --> 06:51.846
That all changed with a bouquet
of flowers. Three bouquets.

06:53.151 --> 06:56.720
Seemed our good deeds
landed on the radar
of some philanthropist.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.854
It was an offer
to step up our game.

07:00.420 --> 07:05.033
Why take down a street hustler
when you can go after
international corruption.

07:05.381 --> 07:09.080
We became a team. We tried
to come up with a cool name.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.734
The Robin Hoods.

07:11.561 --> 07:15.173
Nah, I ain'’t going
for any name calling
us no damn hoods.

07:15.347 --> 07:19.482
Wick even suggested
the Motley Crew,
with a straight face.

07:19.656 --> 07:23.094
Hell nah. But I like
the Misfits.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.924
Not everyone agreed
on the name, but eff that.

07:27.142 --> 07:30.537
I'’m telling the story,
So the Misfits it is.

07:35.890 --> 07:39.633
Anyway, the next chapter
in our story started
a little while ago

07:39.894 --> 07:41.504
in a prison in Los Angeles.

07:48.163 --> 07:52.254
WARDEN: The FBI is here
to extradite inmate 272523
to Mr. Schultz'’s prison.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.256
WARDEN: Where?England.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.737
Mr. Schultz runs
a privatized prison there,

07:56.824 --> 07:59.130
this particular inmate,
Richard Pace, broke out.

07:59.261 --> 08:02.003
And you came all this way
just for a prisoner escape?

08:02.873 --> 08:03.918
Wife issues.

08:04.962 --> 08:07.095
RINGO: Wife issues is Latin
for this prisoner

08:07.182 --> 08:09.010
was laying pipe
to Schultz'’s wife.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.363
And for Schultz...
that caused some issues.

08:14.711 --> 08:17.322
WARDEN: Wish prisons here would
send wardens on vacation.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.715
HASSAN:
Mr. Schultz isn'’t a warden.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.762
WARDEN: No,
he'’s a senior partner
in a multinational company

08:21.849 --> 08:25.113
which happens to own,
among other things,
prisons all over the planet.

08:26.244 --> 08:29.204
Coming up on the right here.
440, open 312.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.032
OFFICER 2: Copy 21, opening now.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.643
Name'’s Richard Pace...
you should know.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.123
Come back 440?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.560
OFFICER 2: Well, we just got
paperwork for his
immediate release.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.606
The judge apparently
threw out the charges.

08:47.614 --> 08:48.919
SCHULTZ:
That'’s not Richard Pace.

08:51.487 --> 08:52.532
He is good, though.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.929
This is Pace this morning
from the prison exercise yard.
Look at this.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.716
There. Right there.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.763
Look. I'’m just spitballing here,
but I think that was a drone.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.244
All right, if that'’s the drone,
what'’s the payload?

09:09.766 --> 09:12.421
Could have been key-cards,
it could'’ve been a birthday
cake with a hacksaw in it.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.337
All we know is that
we'’ve searched this
installation from top to bottom.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.121
Richard Pace isn'’t here.

09:17.295 --> 09:20.124
I don'’t get it. If he was going
to be released in 24 hours,

09:20.211 --> 09:21.343
why break out?

09:21.822 --> 09:24.564
Probably because
there was something
he needed to do today...

09:26.174 --> 09:27.218
not tomorrow.

09:30.744 --> 09:33.442
You are...

09:33.616 --> 09:34.748
Hanni.Hanni.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.445
Hanni Abu Assad.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.055
Right.

09:38.882 --> 09:39.840
So...

09:41.624 --> 09:42.669
where'’s Pace?

09:43.583 --> 09:44.714
How would I know?

09:46.890 --> 09:49.023
Well, you bunked with him
for three months.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.809
It seems that he did
that intentionally

09:52.896 --> 09:56.421
because you had something
to tell him, something...

09:57.379 --> 09:59.033
valuable to tell him.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.387
I don'’t know.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.346
Right.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.048
Well, maybe...

10:16.224 --> 10:22.404
you will feel better...
talking to me in... private.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.416
GUARD: Power went down.WARDEN: Damn it.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.897
Now we got a foreign national
alone in a room with a felon.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.817
WARDEN: What'’s going on?

10:46.297 --> 10:47.342
SCHULTZ: Look at that.

10:49.910 --> 10:50.998
I know where Pace is.

10:52.477 --> 10:53.478
Excuse me.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.047
RINGO: Hell yeah,
he know where Pace was.

10:57.395 --> 11:01.095
He just beat the info
out of poor Hanni
with a damn cell phone.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.236
RINGO: Turns out,
Hanni used to be the valet

11:12.323 --> 11:14.456
of Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.241
Pace learned the prince
like to do stupid shit

11:17.372 --> 11:19.591
like travel into Los Angeles
once a year

11:19.679 --> 11:21.158
for a single day of shopping.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.647
PRINCE: My usual.MAN: Next round on the house.

11:31.734 --> 11:35.303
RINGO: He also never traveled
without his high-value
collection of timepieces.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.871
That'’s expensive-ass watches.

11:40.264 --> 11:43.441
Girard-Joseph Grand Ellava.

11:43.659 --> 11:49.578
Gold, platinum, 23 carats,
D color, flawless diamonds.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.713
One of only two ever made.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.068
Richard Pace.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.767
Pleased to meet you.Nice to meet you, too.

12:07.378 --> 12:10.120
You'’re Kuwaiti, huh?

12:10.991 --> 12:14.429
I have a daughter who works
in the Middle East, UNICEF.

12:15.473 --> 12:21.653
Charitable work, children,
refugees and...
something like that.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.228
...how much does a watch
like that go for?

12:31.489 --> 12:34.971
Four, five mill--
Oh, I'’m so sorry.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.668
I do apolo--I'’m so sorry.PRINCE: Really.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.802
Please, please, please.
Just let me, there you go.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.978
It'’s fine.You got some right there.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.327
Oops, I do apologize.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.026
If you don'’t mind.Yes, okay.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.593
My fault, I'’ve had
too much to drink

12:48.768 --> 12:53.076
it'’s just one of those days.
Okay. Time to go.

13:04.522 --> 13:05.523
GUARD: Hello.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.177
Hello.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.745
What you got there?

13:12.922 --> 13:14.228
GUARD: Prince Hakeem Al Zahrani?

13:14.881 --> 13:16.056
It'’s an old picture.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.236
Do you want to go
and talk about this?

13:22.279 --> 13:23.672
Hmm, no, not really.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.935
Yeah, he wants to go
and talk about it.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.241
Jesus.

13:45.607 --> 13:46.913
It'’s an honest living.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.620
Penthouse.AGENT: Hold up.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.448
You don'’t have any
jurisdiction or authority here.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.797
You let the FBI
handle this.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.320
GUARD: You heard him.
Knock yourself out.

14:08.717 --> 14:09.892
Here you go.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.095
MAN 1: Go to the bedroom.MAN 2: Copy that.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.054
I'’m going to go wash up.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.884
You go through the first door.
I'’ll go through the second.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.586
My watches are gone!

15:38.589 --> 15:39.634
How are we doing?

15:41.157 --> 15:42.158
We had some company.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.595
Almost there.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.380
How we doing?

15:46.902 --> 15:48.251
We are almost there. Yeah.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.351
GUARD 1: Hey!GUARD 2: Hey!

16:09.359 --> 16:12.841
Gentlemen, I had a lovely stay.Your car is waiting for you.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.935
Surprise!

16:22.894 --> 16:24.548
Ah, thank you.

16:27.638 --> 16:30.206
Nice to see you again.Good to see you too, uh,

16:30.337 --> 16:33.862
Prince Al Zahrani?No, I made that up.

16:34.471 --> 16:39.389
RINGO: This is the Prince.
Not Prince Al Zahrani.
He made that shit up.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.566
He claims to be a prince
from some country
nobody'’s ever heard of.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.308
But that don'’t matter.
What matters is...

16:46.222 --> 16:49.312
remember the philanthropist
who sent the flowers?
This is that dude.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.098
Shall we?Let'’s roll. Like right now.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.061
All right, bring the cars
around, let'’s go. Let's go.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.384
Shit.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.304
Thank you. These are mine.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.178
So this is a con?

17:29.700 --> 17:32.921
RINGO: Con seems
pretty inadequate
to describe what we did.

17:33.008 --> 17:36.490
We even hired the dude
to play Hanni
as Pace'’s cellmate.

17:36.751 --> 17:39.623
Yeah, we probably gon'’
have to give that dude
some worker'’s comp.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.235
Color me minorly
impressed, but why?

17:43.279 --> 17:47.588
Simple. We need you,
you don'’t need us.
For that, we needed leverage.

17:56.771 --> 18:00.383
PRINCE: You know what they call
a serious crime captured
on multiple hotel cameras?

18:01.732 --> 18:06.215
Leverage. Now,
you need us. Simple.

18:19.968 --> 18:22.971
Who exactly is us?Me and my friends.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.897
You don'’t have to come with us.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.123
Up to you.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.655
What are we waiting for?

19:12.107 --> 19:14.501
What the hell did Pace do to
Schultz'’s wife that was so bad?

19:16.633 --> 19:19.636
Let'’s just say Mrs. Schultz
isn'’t the one upset by it.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.943
Oh. Oh...

19:40.614 --> 19:44.183
Here'’s to my kidnapping. Whoo!

19:44.661 --> 19:47.882
Kidnapping requires a element
of force, no force here.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.579
You'’re free to go
whenever you want.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.277
There'’s an exit sign
right behind you.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.801
Yeah. Well, maybe I'’ll
just pass on that one.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.455
My man.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.761
The name'’s Ringo.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.548
That'’s Violet. That's my man
Wick over there.

20:02.026 --> 20:05.552
You already had a chance
to meet the con artist
formerly known as Prince.

20:06.335 --> 20:10.600
Is this some kind
of criminal organization?Nah, not criminal at all.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.428
Just a few people trying
to do what'’s right.

20:12.559 --> 20:18.826
Well, you got the wrong guy here
because right is not what I do.

20:18.956 --> 20:22.917
Oh, we know.
You got quite the reputation.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.571
Yeah, the only thing that
you better at

20:24.658 --> 20:26.660
than stealing
people'’s shit is getting caught.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.359
And escaping.
You'’re a damn legend.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.840
How many of Schultz'’s
prisons did he escape?

20:33.014 --> 20:35.146
By my count, four, give or take.

20:35.451 --> 20:38.498
Four prisons?
Built by the same guy?

20:38.585 --> 20:42.850
I love it, man,
we all love it.
But you know who don'’t love it?

20:42.980 --> 20:44.286
Schultz.RINGO: Mm-mm.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.896
He don'’t love it at all.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.856
And that don'’t have nothing
to do with the rumors
about you and his wife.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.515
Schultz didn'’t come to extradite
you back to his prison.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.561
Those papers were forged.
He was there to kill you.

20:58.866 --> 21:03.000
Judging by your contributions
to society thus far, I can'’t say
it was the wrong choice.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.133
But we'’re giving you
a chance to turn things around.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.266
Oh great, lucky me.

21:07.396 --> 21:11.835
Look, all you have to know is
we got the same piece of shit
on our shoes,

21:12.096 --> 21:13.272
Werner Schultz.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.449
RINGO: Shit doesn'’t even
start to explain.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.581
He even owns prisons
in the Middle East.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.497
Schultz saw dollar signs
and wanted to expand,

21:21.889 --> 21:23.847
so he partnered
with the Muslim Brotherhood.

21:23.978 --> 21:27.634
The local terrorist organization
in some country
called Jazeristan.

21:28.025 --> 21:31.986
Well, you know Schultz
does build prisons
and pretty good ones.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.686
But terrorism? Well,
that'’s a bit of a stretch.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.080
Yeah, you'’d think
until Schultz realized

21:39.167 --> 21:41.300
that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.738
Yeah. A hard-partying Arab
by the name of Jason Quick.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.784
RINGO: They got him
for everything.

21:47.871 --> 21:50.700
Drugs, possession,
weapon solicitation you name it.

21:52.485 --> 21:53.703
I am back, bitches!

21:54.051 --> 21:55.488
RINGO: Schultz just up
and let him go.

21:59.448 --> 22:03.800
Turns out that Jason Quick
is actually Jasim bin
something or something.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.107
One of the top dogs
of Muslim Brotherhood'’s son.

22:06.368 --> 22:09.589
And when Schultz released
him, it granted him
favor with this man.

22:09.980 --> 22:14.681
Abu Hirawa.
Real name is Am-jam...

22:16.509 --> 22:18.598
What he had to say.

22:18.902 --> 22:21.862
For all intents and purposes,
Bin Laden'’s successor.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.520
...Schultz
is in bed with this guy.

22:27.911 --> 22:32.394
In bed, under the covers
with some KY Jelly doing
all kinds of freaky shit.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.789
Why are you telling me?'Cause you'’re a thief.

22:36.093 --> 22:40.141
Let me stop you right there.
Yes, I'’m a thief...

22:41.272 --> 22:44.841
but I only steal from
upstanding citizens
who pay insurance.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.583
Nobody gets hurt.
Particularly me.

22:47.844 --> 22:51.065
Besides... I only work alone.

22:52.196 --> 22:57.114
And if that changes,
and it won'’t...
none of you will make the cut.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.991
There'’s millions of dollars
worth of gold in one
of those locations.

23:10.824 --> 23:11.912
I like gold.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.569
VIOLET: Terrorism generates
a lot of cash, kidnappings,

23:16.786 --> 23:19.659
drugs, oil, theft,
but it'’s all dirty.

23:19.746 --> 23:22.488
It'’s traceable. In order
to launder the money...

23:22.879 --> 23:25.447
Gold.RINGO: Oh yeah. Gold.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.929
Hidden in a place that no one
wants to dare step foot in,

23:29.277 --> 23:30.626
unless they'’re forced to.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.027
A prison?

23:40.375 --> 23:42.812
Oh, not just any old prison.
Your boy Schultz'’s prison.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.511
We'’re goin' in.
You want to join us?

23:48.470 --> 23:52.082
You want me to go
into a Middle Eastern country,

23:52.256 --> 23:55.869
one that you'’ve been explaining
for an ungodly amount of time,

23:55.999 --> 23:58.872
that is filled with terrorists,
to steal their gold.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.483
Yeah.That'’s exactly what
we want you to do.

24:01.701 --> 24:05.008
In other words, something good,
for once.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.628
Oh, that'’s rich. That'’s rich.

24:16.237 --> 24:19.806
...how do I put this, I got it.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.634
Nope.

24:22.330 --> 24:23.679
And if it makes
you feel any better,

24:24.506 --> 24:27.030
I'’m pretty sure every
one of you is insane.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.293
Especially this dude
sitting over here.

24:29.729 --> 24:33.341
Excuse me. We on descent.
Please fasten your seatbelts.
Thanks.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.781
You know, I guess I should
have asked this sooner,

24:39.521 --> 24:40.696
descent to where?

24:41.610 --> 24:43.525
To Abu Dhabi.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.094
Abu Dhabi.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.578
Hey man, Schultz'’s new besties,

24:53.274 --> 24:56.582
the dudes in the grey suits,
Muslim Brotherhood.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.498
They'’ll try to kill
you again, you know.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.893
You change your mind,
there'’s a card
in your left breast pocket.

25:04.894 --> 25:07.723
Call us.PACE: Arrivederci.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.820
My, my, would you look at this?

25:20.214 --> 25:21.302
Taxi?

25:26.786 --> 25:28.309
Whoa.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.751
Watch the tempo

25:36.056 --> 25:38.101
Watch the tempo

25:38.362 --> 25:40.669
Watch the tempo

25:40.843 --> 25:43.454
some mad love...

25:43.977 --> 25:48.721
Why don'’t you take me
to the best five star hotel
in... Abu Dhabi?

25:53.769 --> 25:57.033
DRIVER: First time here?Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.513
PACE: You know what?DRIVER: What?

25:58.905 --> 26:01.255
I think I'’m gonna like it here.Yeah, you will.

26:04.127 --> 26:08.305
love me, love me, love me

26:09.132 --> 26:11.787
Give me some mad love

26:19.839 --> 26:24.060
You going too hard

26:26.323 --> 26:28.325
The two apart

26:30.284 --> 26:33.766
Why you makin' it so hard?

26:34.680 --> 26:38.727
You ready, break down my guard

26:40.511 --> 26:44.994
Love me like we ain't
Never let go

26:45.473 --> 26:48.607
Poco a poco, muy, muy lento...

26:51.000 --> 26:54.787
Love me, give me some mad love

27:10.411 --> 27:15.808
Hey there.
Give us your best single
malt whiskey. Two ice cubes.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.768
It'’s a good-looking watch.

27:21.030 --> 27:26.427
Leon LaFleur Magnifique. 769
working parts,

27:26.775 --> 27:31.432
each one created by
a single craftsman at
an atelier in Switzerland.

27:32.389 --> 27:35.784
I believe, only four of them
ever made in the world.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.568
Huh. Impressive.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.399
Wonder how this
wallet got down here?

27:43.009 --> 27:45.925
Sorry.
Huh. Your wallet.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.361
No, it'’s not.

27:48.275 --> 27:51.147
And I rather drink alone.
I actually insist on it.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.194
Okay, fair play.

27:56.283 --> 28:00.548
All right. Auf Wiedersehen.
Good luck to yourself.

28:07.990 --> 28:08.991
PACE: Sorry.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.304
Hi, gin and tonic, please.

28:25.747 --> 28:26.966
I don'’t believe it.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.884
Oh, excuse me.
I think you dropped this.

28:32.101 --> 28:35.888
Oh, thank you so much.
What a pleasure meeting you.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.280
Yes, you too.Where are you from?

28:37.759 --> 28:40.327
I'’m from the states.
Um, I travel--Ma'’am.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.373
I believe you
dropped your pocketbook.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.854
Thank you. You know what?
That is so funny.

28:45.941 --> 28:48.596
I literally just picked
that up in the gift shop.I bet you did.

28:48.770 --> 28:53.122
But you know, you must be
more careful the world is rife
with thieves and cutpurses.

28:53.383 --> 28:56.082
Don'’t I know it.
Which is why I bought
the cheapest one I could...

28:56.909 --> 28:59.650
and keep my real one...
close to me heart.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.306
Is there anything else you
keep close to your heart?

29:04.090 --> 29:07.441
Let me see, um...
the trials of the poor,

29:07.571 --> 29:10.836
the downtrodden, tribulations
of the world'’s oppressed.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.926
Otherwise, no, not a thing.

29:14.317 --> 29:15.928
Sounds like a lonely existence.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.582
No, actually,
it'’s quite fulfilling
and lacks little.

29:19.888 --> 29:20.889
Sometimes...

29:22.499 --> 29:25.067
things are missing in our lives
and we don'’t even know it.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.332
Things tend to stay missing
if you don'’t actually
look for them.

29:29.593 --> 29:33.075
If you don'’t mind, the lady
I were having a conversation.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.642
Really now, that'’s very funny

29:34.729 --> 29:36.818
because I thought you prefer
to drink alone.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.342
In fact, if I recall,
you insisted.

29:40.648 --> 29:44.739
Go. Find your own.
This one is mine.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.873
Huh! What did you say?She'’s my new friend.

29:49.831 --> 29:50.876
Really?

29:51.659 --> 29:55.445
That'’s very interesting
because actually...
she'’s my daughter.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.797
And I don'’t know you, friend.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.197
The gentleman, he had
to run away there,

30:08.284 --> 30:11.548
but he said for his drinks,
our drinks on his room.
Thank you so much.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.902
That was a very
swift move back there.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.382
Yeah. Well, I had
quite the teacher.

30:22.081 --> 30:25.258
It'’s good to see you, Hope.
It really is.

30:25.824 --> 30:26.912
You too, Dad.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.524
So, how'’d you end up
in Abu Dhabi?

30:31.133 --> 30:35.007
Same way I ended up in prison.
Against my will.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.573
And you?

30:37.313 --> 30:39.838
I'’m-- I'm here to meet
some philanthropist.

30:39.968 --> 30:43.276
We'’re talking through new,
innovative ways to help
the refugee crisis.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.060
That'’s good. Impressive.Yeah, it is.

30:45.365 --> 30:49.195
And when I was
in the hotel lobby,
I saw another crisis developing.

30:49.412 --> 30:52.328
Yeah.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.289
Hey, listen.

30:58.073 --> 31:01.903
Let'’s go for a walk, shall we?
It'’s been a while.Yeah, okay.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.602
Maybe on second thoughts...

31:06.212 --> 31:08.910
Very nice.Pay the bill here...

31:09.171 --> 31:11.739
Here you go.
Keep the change.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.227
Have you seen your mother?

31:22.619 --> 31:24.230
She'’s my mom, so, yeah.

31:25.057 --> 31:28.234
Yeah, she'’s fine.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.714
Re-married.Hmm.

31:31.585 --> 31:35.023
Took her a long time,
but she got over it.That'’s good.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.416
Yeah.

31:36.851 --> 31:37.983
That'’s really good.

31:38.461 --> 31:41.725
How about you, how'’re you doing?
You... married yet?

31:42.378 --> 31:45.642
No, I'’m not married.
I, uh...

31:45.904 --> 31:47.644
I have trouble trusting men.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.604
Daddy issues.

31:53.824 --> 31:56.915
Look, Hope, I know this
sounds like a cliche,

31:57.132 --> 32:00.135
but I did it for you
and it was the right
thing to do at the time.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.355
Why? Because you'’re
just so wrong?

32:07.838 --> 32:08.883
PACE: It was.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.147
You know what the sad thing,
I mean the real tragedy
of this whole thing is?

32:13.148 --> 32:14.758
You actually believe that.

32:16.369 --> 32:18.501
But I know deep down,
under all that

32:18.675 --> 32:21.591
urbane panache
and capricious thievery,
you'’re good.

32:24.072 --> 32:25.682
Just gotta find that person.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.124
Yeah, well that'’s
easier said than done.

32:44.745 --> 32:48.662
I have to go. I'’m sorry.
I have to go prepare
for this meeting.

32:48.749 --> 32:49.750
Okay.

32:51.926 --> 32:54.146
It'’s good to see you.Yeah, it'’s good
to see you too, Dad.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.365
Bye.Bye.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.213
Okay. I'’m in.

35:28.822 --> 35:32.173
But if I do this,
and this comes off,

35:32.869 --> 35:35.176
it'’s because of what
I bring to the table.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.875
I'’m in charge.
What I say goes, no exceptions.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.270
We can live with that.It'’s why we picked you.

35:42.401 --> 35:48.276
And the split? Tch.
Not even, not five ways.
50/50 boom, boom.

35:49.582 --> 35:52.802
Split of what?The money. The gold.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.372
There won'’t be any.What do you mean
there won'’t be any,

35:57.459 --> 36:00.158
I thought that was the point
of the story. Steal the gold.

36:00.462 --> 36:03.987
It is. But that doesn'’t mean
they'’ll be any gold to split.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.555
Well, why the hell not?Because it'’s not about us.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.167
It'’s about preventing that gold
from financing terrorism.

36:09.384 --> 36:13.693
Right, I get that. Steal
their gold, stop the terrorists.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.478
To the victor goes the spoils.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.611
There are no victors, Pace.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.179
We'’re never going to be able
to stop the Muslim Brotherhood,

36:21.875 --> 36:24.269
but we can try and stop
one bomb from going off.

36:24.356 --> 36:27.359
We do what we do to help
others, never ourselves.

36:30.666 --> 36:33.060
PACE: Oh my God,
here we go again.

36:33.408 --> 36:38.065
If this weren'’t so amusing...
it would be sad.

36:38.892 --> 36:41.329
Ciao.

36:45.855 --> 36:46.856
RINGO: Pace.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.992
Pace. Pace!

36:52.340 --> 36:55.778
Look, I'’m not sure
how you got hold
of your information

36:56.475 --> 37:00.261
or who told you I might
even have any interest
in this act of compassion,

37:00.566 --> 37:03.133
but they were wrong.I did.

37:04.787 --> 37:06.267
I told them.

37:07.529 --> 37:11.577
I told you had a meeting
about the refugee crisis.
This is that meaning.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.143
Oh, for God'’s sake.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.844
Don'’t tell me they
brought you in, too.No, I pulled them.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.368
This is my idea.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.458
Hope, listen to me,
if any of this is true,

37:23.850 --> 37:26.156
contact the embassy,
talk to a congressman.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.375
We tried.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.725
VIOLET: Jazeristan is
an important US ally.

37:29.943 --> 37:33.338
U.S. Centcom uses Al Udeid
Air Base to launch assaults

37:33.425 --> 37:36.515
in the Middle East.
America doesn'’t need to
ask too many questions,

37:37.037 --> 37:39.387
and Jazeristan doesn'’t
need to find any answers.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.609
Do they know about this?

37:43.870 --> 37:46.089
They know, but they
don'’t know, you know?

37:50.268 --> 37:53.749
Come on, darling,
what am I gonna do here?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.970
This. I want you to do this.

38:00.539 --> 38:03.368
Look, Dad,
we need you.

38:05.892 --> 38:06.980
I need you.

38:09.112 --> 38:12.507
Just this once, I'’m asking
you not to walk out the door.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.516
I must need my head examined.

38:22.561 --> 38:25.520
Yeah, I feel like
I should mention something
about Abu Hirawa.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.175
I mean it'’s kind of his gold
we'’re after.

38:28.436 --> 38:30.743
In Arabic,
Hirawa means cane.

38:53.243 --> 38:54.767
And that was this gardener.

38:55.724 --> 38:58.684
That'’s good to know.

38:59.293 --> 39:03.428
Prison. Hard to get into,
even harder to get out of.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.255
Especially with
a truckload of gold.

39:05.604 --> 39:08.781
First question.
Where'’s the gold?

39:09.172 --> 39:11.784
We got a couple of contacts
on the inside so we know
the lay of the land,

39:11.914 --> 39:13.351
but we still don'’t know
where the vault is.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.178
Do you have surveillance
photos on this facility?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.398
Yeah, we have. Come, I show you.

39:18.051 --> 39:21.620
Facility is state-of-the-art,
one of the most modern
prisons on Earth.

39:21.924 --> 39:24.536
And it'’s completely
self-contained--
food, water, everything.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.059
Wait. Go back.

39:27.626 --> 39:30.759
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Left.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.458
If the prison'’s self-sustained,

39:33.762 --> 39:36.983
I would expect there'’s
a fully functioning
laundry on the inside.

39:37.113 --> 39:40.334
Yeah. Right next to the kitchen.
Using the same venting system.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.292
That'’s the steam in the photo.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.252
Mm. Right, but it doesn'’t,
does it, really?

39:45.426 --> 39:47.385
Because while my Arabic
is little bit rusty,

39:47.472 --> 39:50.823
I'’m pretty sure...
that'’s a laundry truck.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.608
Meaning Schultz built the prison
without installing

39:53.695 --> 39:55.523
an actual industrial laundry.

39:55.654 --> 39:58.265
Just a system to generate
steam for appearances.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.923
Voila! Now we know
where the gold is.

40:04.140 --> 40:07.187
Right under the shitter.Let'’s go to prison, shall we?

40:07.448 --> 40:12.410
Oh, and by the way,
I only fly first class.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.151
Me too!Oh-ho, congratulations.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.937
Next time we'’ll be sure to book
your ticket on Princess Air.

40:18.024 --> 40:19.286
Mm-hm. What do you
mean, next time?

40:19.547 --> 40:21.897
This entire region
is on high alert.

40:21.984 --> 40:25.510
A group like this,
landing at the airport
will attract attention.

40:25.597 --> 40:27.468
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
point remains the same.

40:27.903 --> 40:30.036
Trains, planes, automobiles.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.518
I'’m flexible...
as long as it'’s first class.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.220
Hmm?

40:42.135 --> 40:43.745
Why isn'’t anyone
saying anything?

40:47.923 --> 40:50.056
Please, tell me you'’re joking!

40:50.230 --> 40:53.712
We got to fit in.
Vehicles will be scrutinized.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.583
Camels. Muhammad
will be our guide.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.847
Which one is Muhammad?All of them.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.067
Oh.RINGO: My Muhammad.

41:01.197 --> 41:04.331
There'’s about 30 miles
of virgin desert
to the border of Jazeristan.

41:04.549 --> 41:05.550
Well..

41:06.551 --> 41:08.901
this prison isn'’t going
to rob itself. Let'’s go.

41:09.118 --> 41:12.426
By the way, you look great.Thank you. Don'’t be cheeky.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.385
Which camel'’s mine.
Can I get this guy?
He looks friendly.

41:27.659 --> 41:30.923
What'’s a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this?

41:32.185 --> 41:33.447
Believe me, I'’m not so nice.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.885
They didn'’t ask me to join
because of my pleasant
disposition.

41:37.059 --> 41:39.105
So it'’s not because
you couldn'’t find a date.

41:41.368 --> 41:44.066
No, I'’m very good
at finding dates.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.242
Even better at losing them.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.724
You might want to change
your line of work.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.815
Could increase your odds.Says the thief.

41:56.731 --> 41:58.472
No, I decided a long time ago

41:58.559 --> 41:59.908
that if I can'’t be good
to someone,

42:00.779 --> 42:02.563
I can at least try
and be good to everyone.

42:04.260 --> 42:05.697
Good philosophy.

42:28.241 --> 42:29.372
You know...

42:31.897 --> 42:34.247
They say that people
on their deathbeds...

42:35.509 --> 42:37.337
never regret
the things they did,

42:37.903 --> 42:40.993
just... the things
they didn'’t do.

42:42.211 --> 42:45.040
This sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret.

42:47.347 --> 42:49.479
We'’re going to do something
very dangerous here soon.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.613
If there'’s some
kind of connection, well...

42:54.136 --> 42:55.573
It would be a shame
if we die

42:55.660 --> 42:57.705
without
really saying our feelings.

42:59.925 --> 43:02.841
Did you ever think
saying how you feel
might be the reason you die?

43:04.756 --> 43:06.975
Nope. Never crossed my mind.

43:09.978 --> 43:10.979
It'’s not you, Pace,

43:11.414 --> 43:13.460
from an empirical point of view,

43:13.765 --> 43:15.505
you are a very attractive man.

43:17.856 --> 43:20.336
You see I don'’t... date men.

43:22.643 --> 43:23.688
I kill them.

43:38.441 --> 43:40.008
One can only try.

44:06.078 --> 44:09.298
HOPE: Hey.

44:15.130 --> 44:16.262
You okay?

44:18.220 --> 44:19.265
Yeah, I'’m fine.

44:22.964 --> 44:25.401
Just a little scared.Yeah.

44:27.012 --> 44:29.536
Well, it certainly
will have its risks.

44:30.493 --> 44:32.365
Uh, I don'’t mean the prison.

44:33.801 --> 44:36.195
Dad, you'’re doing this
for the right reasons, right?

44:36.848 --> 44:41.417
I mean... you'’re not going to do
like you always do and...

44:42.070 --> 44:43.463
disappear in the final frame?

44:46.553 --> 44:47.597
Do you mean...

44:49.208 --> 44:51.471
The gold?No.

44:55.083 --> 44:57.695
I mean... disappear without me.

45:02.395 --> 45:03.526
Oh, Hope...

45:05.920 --> 45:08.967
I really would like to promise
you that, I really would.

45:13.928 --> 45:16.191
There'’s a beautiful line
I once read in a poem.

45:17.845 --> 45:21.109
"A man travels far to find out
who he really is."

45:23.459 --> 45:24.983
Same goes for you.

45:27.986 --> 45:29.074
Hold steady.

45:33.121 --> 45:34.296
Hold steady.

45:49.355 --> 45:51.749
Get some rest.
It'’s a big day tomorrow.

46:19.602 --> 46:21.996
We'’ll be fine here.Why can'’t I stay with my dad?

46:23.345 --> 46:26.566
It'’s too risky. We don't want
them to be able to kill
two birds with one stone.

46:28.655 --> 46:30.788
That'’s comforting.Really?

46:31.223 --> 46:33.138
No. It was a joke.

46:33.834 --> 46:34.922
Hm.

46:35.227 --> 46:37.185
Well, we usually don'’t
like to work with people

46:37.359 --> 46:38.839
who have families
and loved ones.

46:39.448 --> 46:42.887
Brings emotions into play.
And emotions cloud the mind.

46:48.893 --> 46:49.937
What are you doing?

46:50.285 --> 46:52.026
You never know when you have
to improvise on weapons.

47:00.295 --> 47:01.993
All right.

47:04.343 --> 47:05.300
What do you want to do?

47:06.301 --> 47:08.434
Hmm. What kind of drugs
do you have?

47:09.609 --> 47:10.915
I don'’t drink or take drugs.

47:11.132 --> 47:12.917
Really? Maybe you should start.

47:13.265 --> 47:14.962
Just a little something
to take the edge off.

47:15.441 --> 47:17.051
If you want,
I could go score some.

47:17.225 --> 47:18.966
Absolutely not,
that'’s dangerous.

47:19.532 --> 47:20.533
I was joking.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.797
God, you really don'’t have
a sense of humor, do you?

47:24.189 --> 47:25.364
Don'’t really have time for it.

47:25.886 --> 47:27.583
Not much about what I do
is very funny.

47:31.674 --> 47:32.719
Me neither.

47:40.161 --> 47:42.598
You know what? Let'’s focus on
what we love about our work.

47:43.425 --> 47:46.167
Okay. I like to beat people up.

47:47.908 --> 47:49.823
Okay, cool. Yeah.

47:50.258 --> 47:55.916
Well, let'’s say I am a guy
and I'’m coming at you.

47:56.395 --> 47:57.918
A dumb guy.Right. Okay.

47:58.005 --> 48:00.051
But I have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up. So,

48:00.138 --> 48:02.488
you gotta take
me down in one move.
What'’s your go-to?

48:02.836 --> 48:04.316
One shot?Yeah, that'’s it.

48:04.664 --> 48:06.144
Easy. Punch to the throat.

48:06.361 --> 48:07.710
Not the jewels?No.

48:07.928 --> 48:10.626
Men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk.

48:10.844 --> 48:13.542
What may bring one
to his knees might bring
another one pleasure,

48:13.716 --> 48:15.457
but a solid punch
the Adam'’s apple.

48:16.545 --> 48:17.546
Down in a oner.

48:18.591 --> 48:19.897
Cool.Hmm!

48:21.159 --> 48:22.725
You must have one badass dad.

48:24.031 --> 48:25.206
Never knew him.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.644
I'’m sorry.

48:29.471 --> 48:31.343
Yeah, well, me too.

48:33.780 --> 48:37.871
Well, I for one,
would like to thank him.

48:38.306 --> 48:40.569
If he hadn'’t abandoned you
and made you hate men so much,

48:40.830 --> 48:42.223
you wouldn'’t taken up my fight.

48:45.183 --> 48:46.488
That'’s one way to look at it.

48:47.881 --> 48:49.317
You'’re lucky to have
a dad like yours.

48:49.839 --> 48:50.971
He loves you a lot.

48:52.233 --> 48:53.321
Yeah, I guess so.

48:55.106 --> 48:56.150
Still an asshole though.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.633
Yeah, he is.

49:02.765 --> 49:03.853
Here.

49:05.681 --> 49:07.596
I thought you didn'’t drink.I don'’t.

49:09.294 --> 49:12.384
Let'’s cheers to dads.
The good... and the bad.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.135
All right, ladies
and gentlemen pucker up.

49:24.396 --> 49:26.659
Time to move, Ringo,
don'’t lose interest.

49:27.921 --> 49:31.055
Up you get. Gather round,
ladies and gentlemen.

49:31.490 --> 49:32.882
Okay, take a seat.

49:33.492 --> 49:37.235
The problem with gold is,
well, it'’s heavy.

49:37.452 --> 49:38.671
So we'’re gonna need a vehicle

49:38.801 --> 49:40.238
that can handle
that kind of weight.

49:40.325 --> 49:41.326
On it.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.892
And to get it out
of the country,

49:43.067 --> 49:44.764
camels aren'’t gonna cut it.

49:45.286 --> 49:46.896
So, we'’re going to need
some kind of transport.

49:47.245 --> 49:49.029
I can.PACE: You can what?

49:49.421 --> 49:51.684
Some kind of transport,
my country can provide it.

49:51.901 --> 49:53.903
Princey-poo claims
that he'’s royalty

49:53.991 --> 49:55.514
in a "country" in the Gulf.

49:55.731 --> 49:57.168
I thought you said
you weren'’t a prince.

49:57.429 --> 50:01.085
I said I wasn'’t that prince
but I'’m a prince in my country.

50:01.215 --> 50:04.175
What country?
You ain'’t got no country.

50:05.437 --> 50:07.395
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Ringo.

50:07.482 --> 50:09.180
By the way,
just off the topic here.

50:09.876 --> 50:11.008
Is that your given name?

50:11.356 --> 50:15.360
Yeah, given by me. In honor
of the greatest Beatle.

50:15.447 --> 50:17.405
Here we go again.What you mean here we go again?

50:17.492 --> 50:18.841
What, a black man
can'’t like the Beatles?

50:19.538 --> 50:21.670
See, he'’s a true visionary
with his instrument.

50:22.149 --> 50:24.717
You guys don'’t understand.
He was the first rock and roll
drummer--

50:24.934 --> 50:26.719
influenced every
rock drummer after him.

50:26.849 --> 50:29.417
Even the way that
he held his sticks.Seriously?

50:30.636 --> 50:31.898
I don'’t joke about Ringo.

50:33.291 --> 50:35.815
It'’s better just to accept it
and don'’t karaoke with him.

50:39.558 --> 50:41.777
You suck, you suck!

50:43.910 --> 50:47.000
RINGO: How you gonna say
"Yellow Submarine" ain'’t
a real Beatles song?

50:47.131 --> 50:49.437
I'’m just saying
he'’s an unappreciated singer.

50:49.524 --> 50:52.179
I'’m so glad I asked.
Ringo, we'’re gonna need a list

50:52.266 --> 50:54.790
of all the outside
prison contractors.

50:54.877 --> 50:55.965
No doubt.

50:56.314 --> 50:58.533
And you certainly can'’t
be drilling or tumbling.

50:58.664 --> 51:00.144
We'’re going to have
to blow the vault.

51:00.231 --> 51:01.710
Hope, you'’ve had experience

51:01.884 --> 51:03.843
with phone boxes in
the Peace Corps, is that right?

51:04.061 --> 51:05.714
Yeah?I need that skill set.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.761
And anything else
I taught you at a very
inappropriate age.

51:08.891 --> 51:11.242
Violet, we need to find
out where Schultz is

51:11.416 --> 51:13.461
when he isn'’t at the prison.
We need surveillance.

51:13.722 --> 51:16.377
Already on it.
And it looks like you guys
better grab your robes.

51:16.551 --> 51:19.554
Schultz has a lunch
reservation in 45 minutes.

51:19.728 --> 51:21.295
All right handsome, let'’s go.

51:21.643 --> 51:23.080
That's what I'’m talking about!

51:28.911 --> 51:29.956
Welcome, sir.

51:41.228 --> 51:43.883
PACE: There it is.
Watch that case.

51:46.494 --> 51:50.150
You see how heavy that was?Like a fat lady.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.501
PACE: Looks like Schultz
is making a withdrawal

51:53.632 --> 51:55.677
for our friend Abu Hirawa.

51:57.026 --> 51:58.071
HOPE: We have to stop him.

51:58.985 --> 52:01.292
I'’m sorry, Hope,
you can'’t win them all.

52:01.683 --> 52:05.339
We don'’t know who
this guy is and by now,
he'’s just in the wind.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.558
Jason Quick.

52:07.820 --> 52:09.691
Jason Quick? He looks good.

52:10.823 --> 52:14.043
He got the drugs
out of his system
and he put the jihad back in.

52:14.305 --> 52:15.654
That other guy in the photo,

52:15.828 --> 52:18.091
it'’s the Vice President
of the Bank of Jazeristan.

52:18.178 --> 52:19.527
He'’s trading
the gold for cash.

52:19.745 --> 52:21.355
Yeah, and the bank
opens tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

52:21.877 --> 52:24.402
After that, Jason boards
an afternoon flight...

52:25.838 --> 52:28.145
at which point
he will be "in the wind."

52:30.799 --> 52:32.105
What you got there?
What are you reading?

52:32.758 --> 52:36.327
I picked these up at the souk.Okay.

52:37.066 --> 52:39.852
What?Nothing.

53:32.687 --> 53:34.820
I gave your man gold,
it'’s not my fault he'’s a thief.

53:35.081 --> 53:36.822
ABU HIRAWA: Was.I'’m sorry?

53:36.909 --> 53:39.085
ABU HIRAWA:
Was a thief. Except that...

53:39.477 --> 53:42.567
He wasn'’t.I'’m sorry, I'm not following.

53:42.915 --> 53:46.266
ABU HIRAWA:
On the journey from is to was,
all men tell the truth.

53:46.701 --> 53:50.227
A man'’s eyes cannot lie.
Not to me.

53:50.705 --> 53:52.707
Especially when
I hold them in my hand.

53:52.968 --> 53:54.535
If I thought it was you,

53:54.709 --> 53:56.624
we would not be having
this conversation.

53:57.234 --> 54:00.237
Ah, right, well...
that'’s that then.

54:00.411 --> 54:03.152
If there'’s nothing else,
I'’ve got a bit of company
at the moment.

54:03.283 --> 54:06.504
ABU HIRAWA:
There is a very large operation
taking place in the near future,

54:06.678 --> 54:08.332
but you may leave
your briefcase at home.

54:09.028 --> 54:11.987
You need something much
larger for this transaction.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.990
Ah, right,
who'’s my contact this time?

54:15.426 --> 54:17.602
ABU HIRAWA: Me.You? Lovely.

54:17.906 --> 54:20.082
ABU HIRAWA: Three days.SCHULTZ: All right, thanks.

54:21.693 --> 54:23.085
VIOLET: Oh shit.

54:26.393 --> 54:27.612
Agreed.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.441
Hirawa'’s coming
here to get his gold.

54:31.833 --> 54:35.576
That'’s the bad news. The piss
in our punch bowl bad news...

54:36.490 --> 54:37.535
is this guy.

54:37.883 --> 54:40.059
Khairat Reda is
a London-based banker.

54:40.407 --> 54:43.236
Top brass of the Brotherhood
and he arrives here
in three days.

54:43.541 --> 54:46.195
Hirawa is the finger puppet.
And this man is the hand.

54:46.457 --> 54:48.763
So we accelerate the schedule.
Hit the prison
before they get there.

54:48.894 --> 54:52.637
Uh-uh. We can'’t go
into this thing half-cocked.
We'’re not ready.

54:53.420 --> 54:55.814
I'’m ready. Are you ready?

54:58.425 --> 54:59.513
Huh! We are fully cock.

55:01.167 --> 55:04.213
Cocked, not cock.Yes, cock.

55:04.866 --> 55:07.173
Yes, cock for you,
no cock for me.

55:08.174 --> 55:09.218
I need a drink.

55:12.221 --> 55:14.354
Okay, here we go.

55:14.702 --> 55:17.705
The only way this operation
is gonna run smoothly

55:17.836 --> 55:20.882
is if the prison
isn'’t running smoothly.

55:21.056 --> 55:23.145
Fortunately, we got a few guys
on the inside.

55:24.538 --> 55:26.975
PACE: And working in the place
where we have direct control

55:27.367 --> 55:29.543
over the prisoners'’
physical well-being.

55:29.717 --> 55:31.893
Any health issue that
needs more than ten beds...

55:34.200 --> 55:35.244
PACE: Well...

55:35.462 --> 55:37.682
We gotta get them out, now!

55:38.465 --> 55:40.815
Let'’s just say they're going
to need more than that.

55:48.388 --> 55:51.478
And we walk out the front door.Well, maybe not.

55:52.653 --> 55:54.089
Let'’s play that one by ear,
shall we?

55:55.830 --> 55:59.573
Abdullah, are you aware
of how many violations
you have going on here?

55:59.747 --> 56:02.620
No, we just passed
inspection a few months ago.

56:03.577 --> 56:07.886
Now, I'’m asking,
where are you buying all of your
refrigeration equipment from?

56:08.016 --> 56:10.497
Pacific Industries. Yes.They'’re still in business?

56:10.758 --> 56:12.499
Well, you need to get them
on the phone right away.

56:12.586 --> 56:15.633
We can get some new steamers
down here, get you up to code.

56:15.763 --> 56:18.940
You'’re with the ministry
of Public Health, Mr., uh...

56:19.550 --> 56:22.944
Lionel L. Zagred?RINGO: I am.

56:23.075 --> 56:25.817
I have a friend there.
Maybe I should call him
so I can sort this out.

56:25.991 --> 56:27.558
Are you aware of the GSO?

56:28.297 --> 56:31.475
The Gulf Standard Organization.

56:31.605 --> 56:34.565
They'’re responsible for all
of the food development

56:34.695 --> 56:37.089
and standards going on
here in the Gulf region.

56:37.306 --> 56:41.093
So you could only imagine
how it'’d probably look
if such a prized institution

56:41.310 --> 56:43.791
were to fail an inspection.

56:43.922 --> 56:46.751
Now, if you ask me personally,
Jazeristan shouldn'’t care

56:46.838 --> 56:48.622
about the opinions
of other countries, right?

56:48.709 --> 56:50.581
So if you want-- you want
to call your friend,

56:50.711 --> 56:54.062
you get him on the horn,
call them, right away!They'’re not friends.

56:54.280 --> 56:56.891
It won'’t be me that will be
upsetting the royal family.

56:57.022 --> 56:58.980
GUARD: It'’s my friend's cousin,
and I don'’t even know him.

57:01.505 --> 57:02.636
MAN: Pacific Industrial?

57:02.723 --> 57:04.333
Would you happen to
have any of the...

57:04.856 --> 57:07.380
Vanguard K2350.

57:07.554 --> 57:10.992
Vanguard K2350 in stock, please?

57:12.385 --> 57:15.257
You do? Great. I want two sent
as quickly as possible.

57:15.693 --> 57:17.390
To the Dola Penal
Corrections Institute.

57:23.004 --> 57:24.615
What do you mean you
don'’t have any at hand?

57:24.745 --> 57:26.530
You just literally
two seconds ago told me
you had five.

57:27.008 --> 57:28.619
This is not good.

57:31.404 --> 57:34.320
What did they say?It seems they don'’t
have any, at hand.

57:34.407 --> 57:36.844
But they can rush order them
to us and have them
to us in a week.

57:41.675 --> 57:42.763
Answer that phone, Abdullah.

57:44.504 --> 57:46.854
What if
it'’s the royal family?

57:47.115 --> 57:48.160
Answer the phone.

57:54.427 --> 57:58.257
Hello, sir. This is Pacific
Industrial here.

57:58.475 --> 58:02.217
I'’d like to apologize
for the mix-up we had
over here on our end.

58:02.609 --> 58:06.787
We do in fact have
the 2350 in stock.

58:06.874 --> 58:09.660
We had an unexpected
delivery cancellation.

58:09.921 --> 58:13.315
In fact, one of our men
is in the field as we speak.

58:14.229 --> 58:16.493
Would tomorrow afternoon
be okay for you?

58:16.884 --> 58:20.453
That would be fantastic.
I can'’t thank you
enough for this.

58:20.845 --> 58:24.805
That'’s very kind of you, sir,
much appreciated, good day now.

58:27.329 --> 58:28.417
Cup of coffee?

59:09.415 --> 59:12.244
All right. We go in
after lunch tomorrow.

59:13.462 --> 59:16.074
Hey, Violet, couldn'’t have
found a small worker?

59:16.422 --> 59:19.686
No, it just so happened that
the biggest lush at the company
was also very large.

59:20.252 --> 59:23.124
Is this blood on here?Good luck.

59:23.472 --> 59:24.561
WICK: Violet!

59:30.305 --> 59:33.178
But I do need you to fill out
a little bit more
information right here.

59:33.265 --> 59:36.007
But they haven'’t been cleared!Abdullah, focus!

59:36.137 --> 59:38.705
For your family.Oh yes, I'’ll get them cleared.

59:38.792 --> 59:40.881
Sign. Sign. Right away.Please, yes, yes.
Watch your step.

1:00:09.083 --> 1:00:10.563
WICK: Whoa, whoa.

1:00:10.868 --> 1:00:13.958
Dude, you have anger issues.

1:00:14.175 --> 1:00:16.134
Started from childhood.
Come on.

1:00:21.443 --> 1:00:23.576
That ought to do it, let'’s go
check on their progress.

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:25.926
No, they will handle it.
They will let us know.

1:00:26.013 --> 1:00:28.189
I'’m a soon-to-be captain,
you cannot keep treating me
like this!

1:00:28.363 --> 1:00:29.538
Let'’s go check
on their progress.

1:00:29.713 --> 1:00:31.802
Okay, Abdullah, you'’re
so angry, let'’s go.

1:00:41.115 --> 1:00:42.508
Age before beauty.

1:00:42.856 --> 1:00:46.033
RINGO: All these new steamers,
this has worked out famously!

1:00:46.164 --> 1:00:51.125
Abdullah, K2350.

1:00:51.604 --> 1:00:53.693
They look the same.

1:00:54.389 --> 1:00:56.783
But how closely
have you examined?

1:00:56.914 --> 1:00:58.959
Not so much.Exactly.

1:00:59.525 --> 1:01:04.138
See, same chassis?
Internal component
entirely different.

1:01:10.971 --> 1:01:11.972
No.

1:01:14.801 --> 1:01:18.065
What are you doing?
You have to break-in first.

1:01:18.979 --> 1:01:20.024
Right?

1:01:20.546 --> 1:01:24.724
I mean-- They are your steamers,
if you want to turn on,

1:01:24.811 --> 1:01:26.944
you break, you buy,
you own the steamers!

1:01:27.379 --> 1:01:29.120
No, no, I don'’t,
the royal family does.

1:01:29.207 --> 1:01:32.427
When can we use them?Eh... an hour or two.

1:01:33.037 --> 1:01:35.561
Give the internal
component time to break in.

1:01:36.301 --> 1:01:38.346
I love that you
listen to me now.

1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:40.174
This is like we
build a relationship.

1:01:40.348 --> 1:01:42.786
I feel like I must hug. I hug.

1:01:43.787 --> 1:01:45.397
I'’m-- I'm sorry.

1:01:45.614 --> 1:01:48.356
Part of my culture.
I'm-- I'’m European.

1:01:48.574 --> 1:01:50.141
You'’re European.Yes.

1:01:51.359 --> 1:01:54.580
Finnish. From-- from Finland.Oh.

1:01:54.754 --> 1:01:58.497
We big on hugs. We are,
big hug. I love to hug.

1:01:58.845 --> 1:02:02.936
Oh yes, yes, yes...

1:02:03.154 --> 1:02:05.069
Oh yes, now I have one more
thing for you to do.

1:02:05.417 --> 1:02:08.115
For you to sign and then
I'’m out of your hair, I finish!

1:02:15.557 --> 1:02:16.558
Okay.

1:02:27.091 --> 1:02:28.135
Wow.

1:02:36.361 --> 1:02:38.319
Seemed like a good idea
a few days ago.

1:02:38.885 --> 1:02:40.713
This is going to take
a bloody miracle.

1:02:42.062 --> 1:02:43.107
Indeed.

1:02:43.934 --> 1:02:46.763
Let'’s go. We'’ve got
a busy morning ahead.

1:03:02.430 --> 1:03:03.518
Bon Appetit.

1:03:04.258 --> 1:03:05.651
Born up a tree.

1:03:43.384 --> 1:03:47.127
It'’s amazing the bacteria
you can find at a local
university, huh?

1:03:47.519 --> 1:03:49.521
They really should
protect it better,
you know that.

1:03:49.782 --> 1:03:51.653
I hope there'’s
no harmful side effects.

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:53.786
Sure, there shouldn'’t be those.

1:04:04.318 --> 1:04:06.103
ABDULLAH: Get these people
to the infirmary immediately!

1:04:06.277 --> 1:04:08.845
And for God sakes,
have someone clean this up. Now!

1:04:23.163 --> 1:04:24.904
Well?GUARD: We'’re not sure, sir.

1:04:25.122 --> 1:04:27.820
But a large number of prisoners
and staff start showing

1:04:27.907 --> 1:04:31.693
some sign of poisoning,
acute abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting.

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:33.782
It could be
some sort of overdose.

1:04:35.132 --> 1:04:36.176
So...

1:04:37.482 --> 1:04:40.441
All this is just a little
bit of bad weed?

1:04:41.703 --> 1:04:43.575
Should we, maybe,
call in the National Police?

1:04:45.707 --> 1:04:46.926
Are you high?

1:04:47.927 --> 1:04:51.322
Yes, sir-- I mean no, sir.
That would be bad idea.

1:04:58.024 --> 1:05:01.201
Check every flight, hotel,
and taxi company. Find Pace.

1:05:12.125 --> 1:05:13.518
ANNOUNCER: Sick or ill prisoners

1:05:13.648 --> 1:05:16.260
please report to the infirmary
immediately,

1:05:16.347 --> 1:05:19.437
I repeat all sick
or ill prisoners.

1:05:19.524 --> 1:05:22.135
Please report to
the infirmary immediately.

1:05:35.061 --> 1:05:36.062
Okay.

1:05:39.674 --> 1:05:41.938
Steady, hold it.What?

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:45.506
Oh come on, man,
it'’s not an autopsy.

1:06:04.438 --> 1:06:05.613
WHISPERS: Let'’s go.

1:06:16.798 --> 1:06:20.454
My calculation... due south.By my calculation...

1:06:24.632 --> 1:06:25.546
Yep.

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:48.395
Hammed Al-Zagreb, Office
of Poison and Noxious Gases.

1:06:49.614 --> 1:06:50.876
Mm.

1:06:51.877 --> 1:06:53.922
Who said anything
about noxious gases?

1:06:54.793 --> 1:06:56.273
Nobody, yet.

1:06:56.925 --> 1:07:01.974
See I have to test every patient
and the source of contamination.

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:05.978
Could be something
with simple explanation,

1:07:06.326 --> 1:07:09.416
or something much,
much more serious.

1:07:09.895 --> 1:07:12.680
As I said, will not be
able to determine that

1:07:12.811 --> 1:07:14.813
until I properly
assess the situation.

1:07:15.248 --> 1:07:19.165
We'’re going to need
a Hazmat cleanup immediately.

1:07:25.128 --> 1:07:27.782
...you do not want it
to become international crisis.

1:07:28.305 --> 1:07:31.743
No, no, no, no, no we don'’t.
W-- what did you say you need?

1:07:32.135 --> 1:07:35.355
Hazmat.Hazmat, in Arabic, who died?

1:07:35.486 --> 1:07:39.229
Not Arabic "hazmat."
Hazmat! Hazmat!

1:07:39.707 --> 1:07:41.970
Ah, Hazmat. Okay, okay.

1:07:42.145 --> 1:07:44.843
I understand, yes, okay.
How many you want?

1:07:45.235 --> 1:07:47.672
You know what? I will handle.Okay. Okay, okay.

1:08:17.832 --> 1:08:18.877
You serious?

1:08:19.356 --> 1:08:21.836
With explosives?
I'’m always serious.

1:08:22.185 --> 1:08:23.360
How are we doing on time?

1:08:24.622 --> 1:08:25.666
Running out of it.

1:08:26.319 --> 1:08:28.495
How in the hell are we
going to get explosives
down that tiny hole?

1:08:30.454 --> 1:08:33.805
We'’re not.
We'’re building the Hindenburg.

1:08:40.855 --> 1:08:45.382
Hi. I have been looking for you.
I need to show you something

1:08:45.469 --> 1:08:47.384
this way, it'’s extremely
important and dangerous.

1:08:47.688 --> 1:08:48.689
SCHULTZ: So, where to?

1:08:49.429 --> 1:08:51.997
The El Amadi hospital,
emergency protocol, sir.

1:08:53.172 --> 1:08:57.568
Right, so...
half of the prison population

1:08:57.698 --> 1:09:00.571
are being taken
outside the prison?

1:09:00.832 --> 1:09:05.445
At least half, yes,
but the hospital has cleared
open a wing for us.

1:09:06.011 --> 1:09:08.579
They'’ll be under 24-hour guard.
It'’s all under control, sir.

1:09:08.709 --> 1:09:10.581
All right. Sounds like Pace.

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:20.547
Come on Wick. Allez, allez.
Talk to me.

1:09:21.853 --> 1:09:23.289
All right, that
should be enough.

1:09:25.030 --> 1:09:27.075
Good.Lighter.

1:09:30.383 --> 1:09:31.384
Time?

1:09:32.342 --> 1:09:33.560
PACE: Five seconds.

1:09:34.126 --> 1:09:35.823
Four.In that case...

1:09:36.607 --> 1:09:38.435
PACE: Three, two, one. Come on....make Daddy proud.

1:09:38.957 --> 1:09:40.088
Whoa.

1:09:55.669 --> 1:09:58.759
Are you crazy?

1:09:59.151 --> 1:10:03.373
Yeah, according to authorities,
and all standardized tests.

1:10:04.504 --> 1:10:07.159
GUARD: There was a car bomb,
sir!
Car bomb, my ass.

1:10:11.207 --> 1:10:13.470
Whoop! Damn!

1:10:14.862 --> 1:10:15.950
Wow!

1:10:21.173 --> 1:10:22.348
Pace.What?

1:10:23.610 --> 1:10:25.090
Okay. Do your thing.

1:10:25.656 --> 1:10:28.615
I just get excited.

1:10:34.578 --> 1:10:36.623
PACE: Okay, take a picture.Looking great.

1:10:36.884 --> 1:10:37.972
PACE: Come on.

1:10:38.059 --> 1:10:39.757
Beautiful.PACE: Takes my breath away.

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:44.979
Smile.

1:10:46.111 --> 1:10:47.634
That'’s a beautiful picture.

1:10:47.765 --> 1:10:49.114
Not ready?Hold on.

1:10:49.201 --> 1:10:50.985
PACE: Come on,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

1:11:00.778 --> 1:11:03.128
Show me the vault.GUARD: One moment, sir.

1:11:08.133 --> 1:11:11.441
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Got it!

1:11:12.311 --> 1:11:13.312
There, sir.

1:11:18.186 --> 1:11:20.885
Looks all right to me.GUARD: It looks good, sir.

1:11:25.106 --> 1:11:26.282
Right.

1:11:28.893 --> 1:11:30.982
Hang on a second, zoom in.GUARD: Let me see.

1:11:36.509 --> 1:11:38.032
It seems frozen, sir.

1:11:40.687 --> 1:11:41.732
All right.

1:11:49.392 --> 1:11:50.567
Oh, bollocks.

1:11:53.613 --> 1:11:54.701
Total lockdown.

1:11:55.180 --> 1:11:57.225
Sir, we can'’t,
we possibly can'’t.

1:11:57.487 --> 1:11:59.489
ANNOUNCER: The prison is now
under lockdown.

1:11:59.663 --> 1:12:02.318
I repeat, the prison
is now under lockdown...

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:21.337
It'’s in the gurneys.

1:12:26.907 --> 1:12:28.213
PACE: Allez, allez.Oop!

1:12:44.882 --> 1:12:47.493
You have to stop
those ambulances.You have to step back.

1:12:52.455 --> 1:12:53.760
Good news or bad news?

1:12:54.544 --> 1:12:56.763
Is Pace'’s daughter
good enough for you, Schultz?

1:12:57.373 --> 1:12:58.374
Oh.

1:12:59.505 --> 1:13:01.725
Lovely.
Keep her alive for an hour.

1:13:02.726 --> 1:13:03.857
Thanks.

1:13:14.390 --> 1:13:15.391
MAN 1: Go, go, go!

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.306
MAN 2: Check everything
in the ambulance. Find the gold.

1:13:19.003 --> 1:13:20.178
MAN 1: Follow me.

1:13:22.659 --> 1:13:23.660
Clear.

1:13:29.622 --> 1:13:30.841
MAN 2: Nothing in here.

1:13:32.799 --> 1:13:33.800
MAN 3: Please don'’t shoot!

1:13:41.417 --> 1:13:43.244
MAN 1: We didn'’t find
anything, sir.

1:13:55.343 --> 1:13:56.519
Oi.

1:13:57.868 --> 1:13:58.956
And you are?

1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:02.612
Hazardous waste cleanup.What hazardous waste?

1:14:02.916 --> 1:14:04.744
Look man, we'’re just
trying to do our job.

1:14:04.918 --> 1:14:06.616
If you have any issues
talk to our boss.

1:14:07.007 --> 1:14:08.139
Eh, where'’s your boss?

1:14:08.574 --> 1:14:11.011
Yeah, that'’s a crazy thing.
We have all this work to do

1:14:11.098 --> 1:14:14.450
and they'’re
stacking up crates?Pretty heavy, too.

1:14:18.454 --> 1:14:19.455
There they go.

1:14:28.942 --> 1:14:32.119
MAN: Sir, we just got word,
Abu Hirawa has arrived
for his gold.

1:14:32.642 --> 1:14:35.166
Oh, don'’t worry about this.
We won'’t lose them.
We'’ve got men on every road.

1:14:35.296 --> 1:14:37.298
Thanks for the thought of that,
but what have we got off road?

1:14:37.516 --> 1:14:38.517
Sir?

1:14:42.390 --> 1:14:43.827
You know what?

1:14:44.131 --> 1:14:45.829
I like see what
you '’bout to do.

1:14:45.916 --> 1:14:48.179
Mm-hm. Safety first.

1:14:51.182 --> 1:14:52.923
RINGO: Be driving this thing,
Prince, aight?

1:14:55.795 --> 1:14:59.451
Ay, look, okay, I get it.
You drive,
you control the music.

1:14:59.669 --> 1:15:01.584
I'’m with that,
but we gotta do something

1:15:01.671 --> 1:15:04.064
about the two double
Darth Haters back there.

1:15:04.369 --> 1:15:06.458
I can'’t take it.

1:15:06.763 --> 1:15:09.766
I need music, come on.

1:15:13.683 --> 1:15:15.685
Yeah.

1:15:17.513 --> 1:15:18.688
That'’s your shit, right?

1:15:19.863 --> 1:15:20.864
RINGO: Yeah!

1:15:23.562 --> 1:15:26.478
Do that shit! Yeah!
Let'’s go baby!

1:15:31.091 --> 1:15:32.702
Yeah, baby.

1:15:41.188 --> 1:15:42.407
RINGO: Whoa! Shit!

1:15:45.236 --> 1:15:47.194
SCHULTZ: Go, go, go, go!

1:15:49.153 --> 1:15:50.241
Woo!

1:15:51.242 --> 1:15:53.287
This ain'’t the road.
I'm wit' it though.

1:15:53.636 --> 1:15:55.768
Oh shit, let'’s do it!

1:15:58.771 --> 1:15:59.990
SCHULTZ: Ah, our reinforcements.

1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:04.081
Hello, friends!

1:16:22.099 --> 1:16:24.580
Now it'’s a party,
turn that shit up! Whoo!

1:16:35.939 --> 1:16:38.028
You like that wild shit.
Let'’s go!

1:16:41.466 --> 1:16:43.163
RINGO: I'’m not scared.
I ain'’t scared at all.

1:16:44.991 --> 1:16:45.992
Brakes!

1:16:50.344 --> 1:16:51.476
RINGO: Whoa!

1:16:52.259 --> 1:16:53.521
Oh, shi--

1:16:58.135 --> 1:16:59.615
Y'all all right back there?

1:17:01.007 --> 1:17:02.487
We good. We good?

1:17:12.366 --> 1:17:15.369
Woo. Let'’s go. Come on,
we the Misfits, baby.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:17.894
Gonna mis-fit my foot
in your ass, yeah!

1:17:28.165 --> 1:17:30.776
Now!
Now? Yeah!

1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:43.920
Whoa!Shit!

1:17:46.183 --> 1:17:47.880
Golden showers, baby!

1:17:49.186 --> 1:17:52.189
You don'’t even know what that
means. You'’re nasty, man.
Golden showers.

1:17:53.930 --> 1:17:56.019
Go, go!

1:18:13.689 --> 1:18:16.082
RINGO: So here'’s where we're at.
None of us were armed.

1:18:16.430 --> 1:18:18.519
We wanted Schultz to think
he had the upper hand.

1:18:18.737 --> 1:18:20.478
Plus we ain'’t want
to get shot at.

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:21.958
Hello.

1:18:33.056 --> 1:18:36.363
RINGO: It'’s about now
that Schultz realized
he didn'’t really catch us.

1:18:37.190 --> 1:18:38.235
Fabulous.

1:18:42.369 --> 1:18:44.981
RINGO: Hold up, pay attention
to those white cars.

1:18:45.372 --> 1:18:47.331
How would anyone know
where we were gonna be

1:18:47.418 --> 1:18:49.246
before the chase even began?

1:18:49.681 --> 1:18:51.901
It'’s called an anonymous tip.

1:18:52.162 --> 1:18:56.035
We wanted to get caught
because we had a story to tell.

1:19:36.641 --> 1:19:37.860
So, it'’s still in the prison,
then?

1:19:38.208 --> 1:19:39.252
Not exactly.

1:19:49.872 --> 1:19:51.221
Stop. What are you moving?

1:19:51.351 --> 1:19:54.441
We got a, uh, we got
a repair order right here.

1:19:55.486 --> 1:19:56.530
Here you go.

1:19:59.446 --> 1:20:00.708
Right there.

1:20:04.103 --> 1:20:05.583
Still going to have
to take a look at it.

1:20:09.543 --> 1:20:11.894
You betcha. Here you go.

1:20:13.852 --> 1:20:15.071
Look at that.

1:20:15.767 --> 1:20:16.855
See?

1:20:20.990 --> 1:20:22.600
I heard some
inmate damaged it.

1:20:22.861 --> 1:20:24.558
Oh, yeah.Crazy bastard.

1:20:24.907 --> 1:20:27.648
The bullocks, huh?

1:20:27.953 --> 1:20:30.521
Mutt's nuts.
Okay, have a good day.Yeah, yeah.

1:20:42.446 --> 1:20:43.926
SOLDIER: Put the gun down!

1:20:44.448 --> 1:20:45.623
RINGO: I know
what you'’re thinking.

1:20:46.015 --> 1:20:48.104
Who the hell are these dudes
and where did they come from?

1:20:48.669 --> 1:20:50.976
Check it, Prince told us
he'’d have his soldiers

1:20:51.150 --> 1:20:53.936
just hiding and waiting for
Schultz to brandish a weapon.

1:20:54.110 --> 1:20:56.547
And then these guys rolled up
dressed like extras

1:20:56.677 --> 1:20:58.984
in a bad
Salvadorian action movie.

1:20:59.071 --> 1:21:01.552
No way in hell
these are real soldiers.

1:21:01.857 --> 1:21:02.858
But I played along.

1:21:03.684 --> 1:21:08.298
You can'’t be brandishing
a weapon around a foreign
military aircraft,

1:21:08.385 --> 1:21:10.169
especially from
a sovereign nation of, uh...

1:21:10.343 --> 1:21:11.954
Salwa.Salwa.

1:21:12.302 --> 1:21:13.825
Your country.My country.

1:21:14.260 --> 1:21:17.220
Just-- just-- just a sec,
just a sec.

1:21:18.612 --> 1:21:20.049
Get it done, yes.

1:21:24.183 --> 1:21:27.534
Looks like your daddy dearest
didn'’t come through
for you today, ho'’.

1:21:33.018 --> 1:21:34.106
Finish her off.

1:21:36.456 --> 1:21:38.589
Reservation'’s
under Hope Pace.

1:21:40.678 --> 1:21:42.375
VIOLET: I'’ve been waiting
for that call.

1:22:28.247 --> 1:22:29.901
Fucking men.

1:22:30.075 --> 1:22:31.033
Well, that'’s that then.

1:22:34.123 --> 1:22:35.994
We haven'’t been introduced.
I'’m Hope.

1:22:36.908 --> 1:22:39.911
RINGO: That punch was the least
painful thing that happened
to Schultz that day.

1:22:40.564 --> 1:22:42.827
Inside of one of those
white cars I pointed out?

1:22:43.523 --> 1:22:44.872
Was Abu Hirawa.

1:22:46.048 --> 1:22:50.400
Not my fault.

1:22:51.792 --> 1:22:53.969
It'’s okay. I believe you.

1:22:56.232 --> 1:22:58.190
But there are those who are
not interested in the truth...

1:22:59.191 --> 1:23:02.368
Only in justice.
It won'’t come swiftly.

1:23:07.199 --> 1:23:09.158
RINGO: The next day, some
talking head reported

1:23:09.288 --> 1:23:10.811
the food poisoning
at the prison.

1:23:11.116 --> 1:23:13.858
There was no mention
of any gold.

1:23:14.206 --> 1:23:15.468
Like I said,

1:23:15.773 --> 1:23:18.950
you'’re gonna rob a bank
make sure it ain'’t reported.

1:23:22.345 --> 1:23:26.914
But don'’t you feel it like I

1:23:27.132 --> 1:23:33.138
Cash it cash it yeah cash it

1:23:33.399 --> 1:23:37.838
So what you gonna do

1:23:39.579 --> 1:23:44.802
Or no we want to

1:23:45.455 --> 1:23:46.978
Leave any of them alive?

1:23:47.065 --> 1:23:48.806
Of course not.RINGO: Good.

1:23:54.812 --> 1:23:58.555
Where'’s my dad?Sh-- I don'’t know, he had to
drive the truck here.

1:24:02.211 --> 1:24:05.823
Oh, no.Oh, no what? We got it.
This is good news.

1:24:06.084 --> 1:24:07.955
No.He'’s around here somewhere.

1:24:08.086 --> 1:24:08.956
No.

1:24:10.784 --> 1:24:12.221
I have a terrible
feeling he'’s not.

1:24:20.446 --> 1:24:21.578
WICK: Oh, my God.

1:24:23.188 --> 1:24:24.363
VIOLET: It'’s the original.

1:24:26.844 --> 1:24:28.715
Where'’s the gold?He took it.

1:24:30.282 --> 1:24:31.327
And he'’s not coming back.

1:24:31.501 --> 1:24:34.939
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, this can'’t be.

1:24:35.070 --> 1:24:37.246
No, it can be,
it can so easily be.

1:24:37.985 --> 1:24:40.466
Shit, I am so, so sorry.
I'’m the one who vouched for him.

1:24:40.553 --> 1:24:41.815
I brought him into
this whole thing.

1:24:42.338 --> 1:24:44.079
After a lifetime
of disappointment,
I should have known better...

1:24:46.298 --> 1:24:47.386
Far better.

1:25:08.668 --> 1:25:09.669
Dad?

1:25:11.367 --> 1:25:12.411
Yes.

1:25:14.718 --> 1:25:15.980
You stole the gold.

1:25:19.114 --> 1:25:20.115
I did.

1:25:21.159 --> 1:25:22.552
From us?

1:25:24.467 --> 1:25:25.511
Yep.

1:25:25.903 --> 1:25:27.513
Then what the hell
you still doing here?

1:25:28.601 --> 1:25:31.691
Hopefully... fixing things.

1:25:35.695 --> 1:25:37.132
I cleaned it up a little.

1:25:39.612 --> 1:25:40.700
Oh.

1:25:42.659 --> 1:25:43.660
Thank you.

1:25:44.226 --> 1:25:46.184
I love you.I love you, too.

1:25:50.406 --> 1:25:51.450
Uh, guys...

1:25:51.972 --> 1:25:53.322
ALL: Shh...

1:25:53.713 --> 1:25:55.541
What are you shushing me,
we got stuff to do.

1:25:56.499 --> 1:25:58.979
You know what, this is
cute moment and everything

1:25:59.110 --> 1:26:02.331
but we got a whole Sal,
big Sal-- Sal-wa?

1:26:02.505 --> 1:26:03.506
Salwan.

1:26:03.767 --> 1:26:06.639
Salwan cargo plane
revved up and ready to go.

1:26:06.857 --> 1:26:09.729
Well, let'’s get the hell
out of Dodge. Grab the bird.

1:26:10.077 --> 1:26:11.905
My man.PACE: Yes.

1:26:17.781 --> 1:26:20.087
RINGO: So, we grabbed the bird
and got the hell out of Dodge

1:26:20.218 --> 1:26:21.654
on Prince'’s country's
cargo plane.

1:26:22.829 --> 1:26:24.918
Having a cargo plane
almost made me believe

1:26:25.005 --> 1:26:26.572
he was actually a prince.

1:26:27.138 --> 1:26:29.532
I said almost.

1:26:31.098 --> 1:26:32.883
Yo Ringo! Got your drink.Hey!

1:26:33.013 --> 1:26:34.928
Prince, for you.Thank you.

1:26:35.538 --> 1:26:38.541
Hey, you all got umbrellas
where the hell is my umbrella?

1:26:38.845 --> 1:26:40.499
I want an umbrella,
what type of shit is this?

1:26:41.326 --> 1:26:44.808
This is the life. I mean,
this is always my life.

1:26:44.938 --> 1:26:47.550
Man, I can'’t believe
you'’re actually a prince.

1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:48.812
I mean, in the animal world,

1:26:48.942 --> 1:26:50.988
your parents would have
left you. Or eaten you.

1:26:51.118 --> 1:26:53.904
Mm. A little training,
some skintight leather,

1:26:54.296 --> 1:26:55.949
I could see myself
being a Misfit.

1:26:57.429 --> 1:26:58.952
Don'’t even think about it.

1:27:00.302 --> 1:27:02.478
I'’d like to start by
getting to know you again...

1:27:03.218 --> 1:27:04.436
in my retirement.

1:27:04.784 --> 1:27:07.047
Or maybe we can get to know
each other without retiring.

1:27:09.572 --> 1:27:12.183
Yeah, Dad. What do you say?
Are you a Misfit?

1:27:17.493 --> 1:27:19.103
No, actually, I think...

1:27:21.453 --> 1:27:24.108
I think I fit in just fine.

1:27:24.761 --> 1:27:26.676
Here'’s to us, guys.

1:27:27.459 --> 1:27:29.069
Cheers.Cheers.

1:27:29.156 --> 1:27:31.811
Cheers guys. Bottoms up.ALL: Cheers.
