Previously on Get Shorty...

00:09.902 --> 00:11.895
- Hey!
- Owen here?

00:11.901 --> 00:12.895
He moved out.

00:12.901 --> 00:13.896
What?

00:13.902 --> 00:15.450
Yeah, I haven't seen him in days.

00:15.512 --> 00:17.511
My calls go straight to voicemail.

00:18.527 --> 00:20.877
Amara. Rick just told us you were
coming, what a lovely surprise.

00:20.901 --> 00:21.896
Welcome to Hollywood.

00:21.902 --> 00:23.700
Have a drink, then come to my hotel.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.320
Can I get you anything else?

00:26.901 --> 00:28.049
Get me another one of these.

00:28.075 --> 00:29.075
Sir, where's your car?

00:29.902 --> 00:31.901
- My what?
- You're going downtown.

00:36.901 --> 00:40.895
I didn't know she was gonna stay
in LA until five bloody minutes ago.

00:40.901 --> 00:42.895
- Is she here, in the office?
- Yes.

00:42.901 --> 00:43.901
I'll call you.

Hi, this is Katie. I'm not
in right now, so leave a message.

00:59.901 --> 01:00.896
Welcome back, dude!

01:00.902 --> 01:02.895
You see, I don't even
want you to answer.

01:02.901 --> 01:05.895
I'm just using your
voicemail as an audio diary.

01:05.901 --> 01:07.901
Recording my thoughts for posterity.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.860
Still sorting out details,
but unless it all goes to shit,

01:13.901 --> 01:16.895
it looks like this thing's
actually gonna happen.

01:16.901 --> 01:19.895
Would be lovely to know if you
thought that was great news,

01:19.901 --> 01:22.901
or if it doesn't much matter either way.

01:23.154 --> 01:26.153
Okay, I'll try again.

01:26.901 --> 01:27.901
Love to Emma.

01:37.901 --> 01:40.895
Can we get some more nachos here?

01:40.901 --> 01:41.896
Sure.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.895
Nachos are on me,
guys! Okay? Now eat up.

01:43.901 --> 01:44.901
Thanks.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.895
Come on, let's go! We'll
play teams, all right?

01:53.901 --> 01:54.896
You guys are on my team,

01:54.902 --> 01:56.895
- bad guys are on the other team.
- No! Yeah, right?

01:56.901 --> 01:58.895
Don't know how to play?
I'll show you how to play.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.895
That's sweet.

02:00.901 --> 02:01.901
Very good try!

02:11.464 --> 02:13.464
- You sure it's his?
- Yep.

02:14.972 --> 02:15.972
So what's your in?

02:17.901 --> 02:19.901
I don't know yet.

02:19.972 --> 02:20.972
I'm not gonna wait up.

02:32.901 --> 02:35.895
All right! Nachos! Who wants nachos?

02:35.901 --> 02:38.895
Nachos! Here, take it.
Yeah, pass 'em around.

02:38.901 --> 02:40.895
Excuse me, is this yours?

02:40.901 --> 02:41.896
Yeah, where did you...

02:41.902 --> 02:44.895
You set it down,
I saw some kid grab it

02:44.901 --> 02:46.895
and make for the door. I
said, "Is that your jacket?"

02:46.901 --> 02:49.895
He dropped it pretty quick and ran off.

02:49.901 --> 02:51.895
- You're shitting me!
- Call the cops.

02:51.901 --> 02:53.895
No, he's long gone.

02:53.901 --> 02:56.895
Thanks. This wasn't cheap.

02:56.901 --> 02:57.901
No worries.

02:59.901 --> 03:00.904
- Bob!
- Yeah?

03:00.932 --> 03:03.926
- Buy him a drink.
- Hey, hey! You want a drink?

03:04.242 --> 03:05.282
You don't have to do that.

03:05.901 --> 03:06.896
No, no, no. No, no. Hey, come here.

03:06.902 --> 03:08.895
Um, another round for him,
and I'll have a nutmeg ale.

03:08.901 --> 03:10.895
- Sure thing.
- Okay. Thanks.

03:10.901 --> 03:13.895
- You know us. Thank you!
- Yeah, sure!

03:13.901 --> 03:15.895
You guys all work together?

03:15.917 --> 03:18.027
Yeah, Gravity Pictures. These,
kids all work in my office.

03:18.051 --> 03:19.051
They're your minions.

03:19.902 --> 03:23.895
Exactly. And it's Lindsay's birthday!

03:23.901 --> 03:27.022
What a nice boss, taking
them all out for happy hour.

03:27.091 --> 03:28.091
Paying for nachos.

03:30.234 --> 03:31.274
So you make movies, is it?

03:31.902 --> 03:34.895
Well, I... I manage,
productions on a budgetary level.

03:34.901 --> 03:38.369
You're a numbers man!
That's where the deals get made.

03:38.568 --> 03:40.562
Not wrong about that. Hey, I'm Bob.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.562
Rudy.

03:42.568 --> 03:44.562
Hey, Rudy, how you doing? What
you, what do you do, Rudy?

03:44.568 --> 03:46.568
I drive for Uber Pool.

03:47.568 --> 03:50.568
Um, you play darts?

03:51.568 --> 03:52.563
I'm fuckin' awful.

03:52.569 --> 03:54.562
Perfect! You're up next. Come on!

03:54.568 --> 03:55.562
All right, guys, Rudy, say "hi"
to Rudy, he's joining our group.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.563
Hi! Hi, Rudy!

03:56.569 --> 03:58.562
Hi, Rudy! Come on!

03:58.568 --> 04:00.562
So the landlord stops
by, and he's, like,

04:00.568 --> 04:02.562
83 years old or something.

04:02.568 --> 04:05.562
And I say, "Lenny, I'm sorry, but
we can't pay the rent this month."

04:05.568 --> 04:08.562
But my housemate has
this big bag of weed.

04:08.568 --> 04:11.562
So I said, "Lenny, can
we pay you with this?"

04:11.568 --> 04:13.562
So Lenny has a little think.

04:13.568 --> 04:16.562
Then he takes the whole bag
of weed and fucking leaves.

04:17.567 --> 04:18.563
- This was three months ago...
- Yeah.

04:18.569 --> 04:20.497
I haven't seen him since.

04:20.567 --> 04:22.517
So we've either sent him off to an early

04:22.524 --> 04:24.562
grave, or he's upstairs getting high.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.562
Either way, we're
living rent free, so...

04:26.568 --> 04:29.562
Nice! Don't ask questions, right?

04:29.568 --> 04:31.562
Shi... I'm...

04:31.568 --> 04:34.562
I'm paying rent and a
mortgage, killing me.

04:34.568 --> 04:36.562
How'd that happen?

04:36.568 --> 04:38.562
Building this big ol'
house in Toluca Lake,

04:38.568 --> 04:42.562
and the city comes by and
they stop construction.

04:42.568 --> 04:43.563
And he tells us... He says,

04:43.569 --> 04:45.562
"Yeah, you know, you don't
the have proper permits

04:45.568 --> 04:48.568
"for your infinity pool." I'm like,
"Wha... That was back in March."

04:50.234 --> 04:52.228
- Ruthless.
- Yeah.

04:52.568 --> 04:54.562
Coming between a man
and his infinity pool.

04:56.568 --> 04:58.562
You know, I have a buddy actually,

04:58.568 --> 05:01.562
who works for the city, what's it
called, where they issue the permits?

05:01.568 --> 05:04.562
The Department
of Building and Safety.

05:04.568 --> 05:07.562
Yeah, that's it. Shit!

05:07.569 --> 05:10.562
Yeah. Yeah. L.A. county.

05:10.568 --> 05:14.562
I have to be in my Uber in two hours.

05:14.568 --> 05:15.335
It's great to meet you, Bob.

05:15.342 --> 05:16.782
Hey! Yeah, yeah, you too, you too...

05:21.568 --> 05:24.562
Hey, Rudy. Rudy! Hey, real quick.

05:24.568 --> 05:26.568
Quick question. Um...

05:28.568 --> 05:31.568
Think your friend, Do me a favor?

05:33.568 --> 05:36.562
I think they're sticklers
for regulations down there.

05:36.568 --> 05:38.568
Worst he could say is, "no," right?

05:39.568 --> 05:41.562
I guess I could ask.

05:41.568 --> 05:42.563
Awesome! Hey... Can
I get a pen real quick?

05:42.569 --> 05:44.562
Sure, here you go.

05:44.568 --> 05:45.563
That would be wonderful.

05:45.569 --> 05:47.562
Really, really would appreciate that.

05:47.568 --> 05:49.562
Um, here's my number,

05:49.568 --> 05:53.562
and please give me a call
after you talk to him.

05:53.568 --> 05:54.568
I'll do that.

05:56.568 --> 05:58.568
I'll fuckin' do that, Bob.

06:21.568 --> 06:23.562
Occupied!

06:23.568 --> 06:24.563
I was rereading the script last night,

06:24.569 --> 06:27.562
and I actually got emotional.

06:27.568 --> 06:30.562
I realized I'm excited
about this project.

06:30.568 --> 06:33.562
We have wonderful actors, a director.

06:33.568 --> 06:37.562
The director's in county
jail, that's a problem.

06:37.568 --> 06:40.568
But I think this movie
could be something special.

06:44.568 --> 06:48.562
Doesn't change the fact that my
involvement in this was coerced.

06:48.568 --> 06:51.568
And I think you,
personally, are despicable.

06:54.568 --> 06:56.562
Sorry, what did you say?

06:56.568 --> 06:59.562
Hey! Didn't mean to hold you up.

06:59.568 --> 07:01.562
Sorry. Come on.

07:01.568 --> 07:05.562
Hey, why don't you sit,
here. You sit over here.!

07:05.568 --> 07:08.562
Here we are! One day
from a "go" picture.

07:08.568 --> 07:09.563
Yeah! It's amazing!

07:09.569 --> 07:11.562
'Course we've all seen
projects get this far,

07:11.568 --> 07:13.562
then take a lastminute nosedive.

07:13.568 --> 07:15.562
- Well...
- Let's not have that happen!

07:15.568 --> 07:18.562
There a problem?

07:18.568 --> 07:19.563
We need Bob Grace to
sign off on our budget,

07:19.569 --> 07:21.562
or we don't move forward.

07:21.568 --> 07:24.562
And we're currently way
over our target number.

07:24.568 --> 07:25.563
And I'm gonna handle that.

07:25.569 --> 07:27.562
You said that last week.
Have you met with Bob?

07:27.568 --> 07:29.568
We've been trading calls.

07:30.568 --> 07:32.562
Trust me, when Bob and I

07:32.568 --> 07:34.808
him roll up our sleeves and
get down to dirty business...

07:36.568 --> 07:37.563
We'll sort this shit out.

07:37.569 --> 07:40.562
- Who's Bob?
- He's VP of Production.

07:40.568 --> 07:42.562
What's he need to sign?

07:42.568 --> 07:45.568
There's a lot of details that need
discussing between today and tomorrow.

07:46.568 --> 07:50.562
Might be easier if Rick
explained it to you.

07:50.568 --> 07:53.568
After the meeting maybe.
What's next, April?

07:54.568 --> 07:55.568
Louis Darnell.

07:56.568 --> 07:58.562
If you really want him back.

07:58.568 --> 08:00.562
Well, he wrote the first
draft, and we all loved it.

08:00.568 --> 08:04.562
He's affordable.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.562
Use him for production
rewrites, that's fine.

08:06.568 --> 08:08.562
But keep him away from the press,

08:08.568 --> 08:10.562
because for whatever reason,

08:10.568 --> 08:14.562
the way he writes is
not the way he speaks.

08:14.568 --> 08:16.562
Hold on. That's Hafdis,

08:16.568 --> 08:18.568
I will connect him.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.562
Hello, everybody!

08:23.568 --> 08:26.562
Hey! How are ya? How's
everything goin' in there?

08:26.568 --> 08:28.568
Well, I haven't been raped yet.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.067
Great.

08:31.569 --> 08:34.562
- This is Alec, he's my lawyer.
- Yep.

08:34.568 --> 08:36.562
And he says that my arraignment

08:36.568 --> 08:40.562
is on Thursday and then
I'm out, no problem.

08:40.568 --> 08:41.563
We're glad to hear that.

08:41.568 --> 08:43.562
But the table read is
tomorrow, as you know,

08:43.568 --> 08:45.562
and it's very important.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.562
Brandon will be there, he
wants the director present.

08:48.568 --> 08:51.562
Yeah, yeah, but let's make
it during my visiting hours,

08:51.568 --> 08:55.568
and we can do it the same way
we're doing it now. Is that okay?

08:57.568 --> 08:59.562
I mean, if it's our only option, then...

08:59.568 --> 09:01.562
Time's up.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.562
What happened to
the five minute warning?

09:03.568 --> 09:05.928
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey! Are we living in a police state?

09:19.568 --> 09:22.568
We should all go out and
celebrate after the table read.

09:26.568 --> 09:28.562
Miles' family is gonna be here,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.562
so you can invite your boyfriend, or...

09:31.568 --> 09:33.562
I mean, if you have one.

09:33.568 --> 09:36.562
- How long you worked with Rick?
- Three years.

09:36.568 --> 09:38.562
- Yeah, you want to be a producer?
- I'm a singer.

09:38.568 --> 09:41.562
No kidding! Where do you...
Do you perform around here?

09:41.568 --> 09:43.562
Not currently.

09:43.568 --> 09:45.562
Well, maybe you'll
sing for me some day.

09:45.568 --> 09:47.568
Probably not.

09:50.568 --> 09:51.568
Okay.

09:55.568 --> 09:57.562
You know, he's a little crazy,

09:57.568 --> 09:59.568
but I think that's good
for the project, right?

10:05.568 --> 10:07.568
Sure worked up an appetite.

10:20.568 --> 10:22.562
So, um, what did April say?

10:22.568 --> 10:24.562
About what?

10:24.568 --> 10:26.562
What do you mean, "about what?"

10:26.568 --> 10:28.562
About me coming back as the writer.

10:28.568 --> 10:29.563
Yeah, she's fine with it.

10:29.569 --> 10:32.562
Yeah! Hey! Thank you, buddy.

10:32.568 --> 10:34.562
I know that she wasn't
too hot on the idea.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.562
These are the notes from the studio.

10:36.568 --> 10:38.528
I need to get 'em done in
time for the table read.

10:38.568 --> 10:40.568
Yeah, right.

10:44.568 --> 10:47.562
What are you talking about?
The table read tomorrow?

10:47.568 --> 10:50.562
No, no. No. I told you I
was gonna get some help.

10:50.568 --> 10:51.563
So do it.

10:51.569 --> 10:53.562
Look, you don't just
hand a writer pages,

10:53.568 --> 10:55.562
and, like, snap your finger.
You know, it's a process, Miles.

10:55.568 --> 10:58.562
It's a few fuckin' lines, Lulu! Just...

10:58.568 --> 10:59.563
I'm trying to handle a
hundred things at once,

10:59.569 --> 11:01.562
I'm trying to focus on Amara
in the production meeting,

11:01.568 --> 11:04.568
I'm trying not to focus on
her in the fuckin' bathroom.

11:06.568 --> 11:09.568
Amara in the bathroom?

11:13.568 --> 11:14.568
Close the door.

11:21.568 --> 11:22.563
What's it called?

11:22.569 --> 11:24.568
The Admiral's Mistress.

11:25.568 --> 11:26.562
Sort of a...

11:26.568 --> 11:27.563
Costume drama.

11:27.569 --> 11:31.562
- Like Shakespeare in Love.
- My wife's favorite movie.

11:31.568 --> 11:32.563
Great movie.

11:32.569 --> 11:34.562
And De Escalones is
producing this thing?

11:34.568 --> 11:36.568
Investor. Strictly money.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.453
She drops twelve bodies in Nevada,

11:41.521 --> 11:43.520
and now she's Spielberg.

11:44.568 --> 11:47.562
- Los Chapulines cartel?
- Southern Nevada branch.

11:47.568 --> 11:49.568
Got her eye on LA.

11:50.568 --> 11:52.562
She have a place here?

11:52.568 --> 11:54.568
Hotel room. But this
is more than a visit.

11:55.568 --> 11:59.568
Or she's really making a movie.

12:17.568 --> 12:19.562
Some good shit, brother.

12:19.568 --> 12:21.562
All day, every day.

12:21.568 --> 12:22.562
Yo, Leo.

12:22.568 --> 12:23.568
What time you work?

12:26.568 --> 12:28.562
- Forty minutes.
- Up all night, you going to work?

12:28.568 --> 12:30.562
Transpo never sleeps.

12:30.568 --> 12:35.562
He's a driver on a movie,
bro. He works mad hours.

12:35.568 --> 12:38.562
We get four hours of sleep if
we're lucky. Everyone on set.

12:38.568 --> 12:42.568
We don't have flake. We do
whatever. Adderall, caffeine pills...

12:43.568 --> 12:44.563
Caffeine pills?

12:44.569 --> 12:46.568
You sell shit this good on a lot?

12:47.568 --> 12:49.568
You'd make hella stacks.

12:50.568 --> 12:51.563
You know anyone at Gravity Pictures?

12:51.569 --> 12:55.568
Was on a show there last
year. Let me grab my shit.

13:02.568 --> 13:04.568
I can get us in that studio.

13:05.568 --> 13:08.562
Bring another key, maybe two.

13:08.568 --> 13:11.562
We're not clear to do
business here in LA.

13:11.568 --> 13:14.562
It's not a big operation.
It's just a couple keys.

13:14.568 --> 13:16.562
Yeah, but we with Amara, right?

13:16.568 --> 13:19.562
I mean, if Mexico thought
Amara had business in LA,

13:19.568 --> 13:21.562
that shit would get serious quick.

13:21.568 --> 13:25.568
Mexico? Like you know what
the fuck you're talking about.

13:28.012 --> 13:31.012
Mexico. Little bitch.

13:33.568 --> 13:35.562
Getting coffee if you want it.

13:35.568 --> 13:36.563
I'm good.

13:36.569 --> 13:38.562
Rick. Can I borrow you for a second?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.562
I'm having a hell of a time
with this casting breakdown.

13:41.568 --> 13:43.568
Yeah! Yeah. What you got?

13:53.568 --> 13:56.568
- You're not working on the breakdown.
- No.

13:58.568 --> 14:01.568
He knows? Yeah?

14:03.568 --> 14:05.562
You know, the bolt
on that bathroom door,

14:05.568 --> 14:08.562
that doesn't slide all the
way. We got to get that fixed.

14:08.568 --> 14:10.568
- Rick?
- You think that you locked it,

14:12.568 --> 14:13.568
somebody pushes it.

14:16.568 --> 14:18.562
Okay. All right. It was unprofessional.

14:18.568 --> 14:20.562
I can't say I'm surprised,

14:20.568 --> 14:23.562
given the amount of terrible
fuckin' decisions you've been making.

14:23.568 --> 14:24.648
Okay. Hold on, just, can I?

14:26.568 --> 14:29.562
Me and Miles have been
with Amara for a while.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.562
And we have seen boyfriends come and go.

14:31.568 --> 14:32.563
Mostly go.

14:32.569 --> 14:36.562
And, when there's
been a, a breakup?

14:36.615 --> 14:38.615
It's our job to pick up the pieces.

14:40.568 --> 14:42.568
So, are you thinking
she's gonna get hurt.

14:43.568 --> 14:46.562
Not her, you.

14:46.568 --> 14:49.568
Okay. Well, I'm a big boy, guys.

14:50.568 --> 14:52.562
What?

14:52.568 --> 14:54.562
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Physically?

14:54.568 --> 14:56.562
Look, I don't know what
went down with you and,

14:56.568 --> 14:59.562
the whole face thing,
but, that was business.

14:59.568 --> 15:02.562
It's all business with Amara.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.562
See, in theory, we're
all in this together.

15:04.568 --> 15:05.563
But that's not the way she thinks.

15:05.569 --> 15:08.562
No. Stop it. You don't
know her like I do.

15:10.568 --> 15:11.563
Um...

15:11.569 --> 15:14.568
No, listen. Is she a
tough negotiator? Yeah.

15:15.568 --> 15:17.562
But under that, that...

15:17.568 --> 15:22.568
Under that, she's a... A
sensitive, supportive woman.

15:24.568 --> 15:25.563
Look, I'm sorry.

15:25.569 --> 15:27.562
I'm sorry to bring my personal
life into the workplace.

15:27.568 --> 15:30.562
Okay? We'll be more discreet.

15:30.568 --> 15:32.562
The office toilet, Rick?

15:32.568 --> 15:33.568
The lock is broke!

15:35.568 --> 15:37.568
And knock, maybe.

15:38.568 --> 15:41.568
I don't need a wing man on
this one, guys. Okay? Thanks.

15:45.568 --> 15:47.562
What about this does he not get it?

15:47.568 --> 15:48.563
I mean, he's just never come

15:48.569 --> 15:50.568
across anyone like Amara before.

15:51.568 --> 15:55.562
Or... Maybe it turns him on.

15:55.568 --> 15:59.562
- Do you have a burner I can borrow?
- Yeah.

15:59.568 --> 16:00.563
You know, historically speaking,

16:00.569 --> 16:05.562
Amara's boyfriends last
three, maybe four days, so...

16:05.568 --> 16:07.562
And if we have to make
this movie without Rick,

16:07.568 --> 16:09.562
that is what we will do.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.568
Hi, is Bob there? It's Rudy.

16:12.568 --> 16:14.562
He'll know what it's about.

16:14.568 --> 16:16.562
Gonna get a writer.

16:16.568 --> 16:18.568
Roberto! How goes it?

16:20.568 --> 16:23.568
Barry? Barry!

16:27.568 --> 16:29.568
What are you doing here?

16:30.568 --> 16:31.568
It's Nathan.

16:33.568 --> 16:34.563
Yeah!

16:34.569 --> 16:37.562
- Owen's housemate.
- Sure! Yeah.

16:37.568 --> 16:39.568
I'm the new PA! Do you work here?

16:40.568 --> 16:41.568
Yeah! I...

16:43.568 --> 16:45.568
I wrote the screenplay.

16:46.568 --> 16:48.562
I thought Louis Darnell
wrote the scree...

16:48.568 --> 16:51.562
Barry's a nickname.

16:51.568 --> 16:52.563
Yeah. No, people here,
they call me Louis.

16:52.569 --> 16:56.562
You are so talented.

16:56.568 --> 17:00.562
- Aw, thanks.
- So you and Owen are both writers.

17:00.568 --> 17:03.568
Hey! When was the
last time you saw Owen?

17:09.568 --> 17:10.568
Been a while.

17:12.568 --> 17:13.563
Is that Vernon?

17:13.569 --> 17:16.561
You remember Nathan. He's our new PA!

17:16.568 --> 17:18.568
Owen's housemate!

17:20.568 --> 17:21.568
Would you look at that!

17:23.568 --> 17:24.561
You two know each other?

17:24.568 --> 17:25.563
They're friends with my housemate.

17:25.569 --> 17:28.561
My exhousemate. She got me the job.

17:28.568 --> 17:31.568
Plus, I know Rick Moreweather, so...

17:35.568 --> 17:36.562
I hope we're keeping you busy!

17:36.568 --> 17:37.568
Yeah!

17:41.568 --> 17:42.562
Lots to do.

17:42.568 --> 17:43.568
Yeah.

17:46.568 --> 17:49.568
Better get back to it.
Good seeing you, Vernon.

17:51.568 --> 17:53.568
- Vernon?
- He's not very bright.

18:01.568 --> 18:03.562
Fuck.

18:03.568 --> 18:06.562
Yeah. He's gotta be with LAPD

18:06.568 --> 18:10.562
or the Fed. Probably got a wire.

18:10.568 --> 18:12.562
I don't know, he's the
one who told me about Rick.

18:12.568 --> 18:14.562
He has to know that I
didn't write the screenplay!

18:14.568 --> 18:16.562
Not if Owen didn't show it to him.

18:16.568 --> 18:18.562
Well, that's what you
said about the girlfriend,

18:18.568 --> 18:19.848
see how that fuckin' turned out.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.568
So what're we gonna do?

18:29.568 --> 18:31.562
We can't afford much help.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.563
No way I run the farm by myself.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.562
When you go to LA, I
don't know how we get by.

18:34.568 --> 18:39.562
Mom! Do you know how much Jake
Gyllenhaal makes per movie?

18:39.568 --> 18:41.562
Eighteen million dollars.

18:41.568 --> 18:44.562
If I make half of that,
we're set for our life.

18:44.568 --> 18:47.562
Okay, and I'm not saying
I get it right away.

18:47.568 --> 18:51.562
But give me a few months,
and I'll send you a check.

18:51.568 --> 18:52.563
Like talkin' to a brick wall.

18:52.569 --> 18:54.562
If I may?

18:54.568 --> 18:56.562
Everyone likes working with you.

18:56.568 --> 18:58.562
And I like working with you.

18:58.568 --> 19:00.562
But the roles I cast
you in, they were small,

19:00.568 --> 19:03.568
and the reason you
didn't get big parts is...

19:04.568 --> 19:06.562
You're not good.

19:06.568 --> 19:08.562
If you're not good enough for Dyersville
Regional Theater, how do you...

19:08.568 --> 19:10.562
But you always told us
to shoot for the moon,

19:10.568 --> 19:13.562
and if we'd missed, we'd
end up among the stars.

19:13.568 --> 19:15.568
I meant that, but not for you.

19:17.568 --> 19:20.562
At least, not for this.

19:20.568 --> 19:22.562
You're all looking out
for me, which is awesome.

19:22.568 --> 19:25.562
But I, I don't want you to worry,

19:25.568 --> 19:28.568
because no matter what,
I'm not gonna give up.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.562
I should go finish packing.

19:31.568 --> 19:34.562
But Gary, don't leave
without saying goodbye!

19:34.568 --> 19:35.768
I'll be down in a few minutes.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.568
Better he doesn't run the farm.

19:41.568 --> 19:43.562
How come?

19:43.568 --> 19:45.568
'Cause he's dumber
than a bag of hammers.

20:00.568 --> 20:01.568
Why she say "nosedive?"

20:04.569 --> 20:07.562
The lady. She say we take a nosedive.

20:07.568 --> 20:10.562
April. No, she didn't mean it.

20:10.568 --> 20:11.608
But I pay for all of this.

20:13.568 --> 20:15.568
The office, all these people...

20:17.568 --> 20:21.562
If they don't make the movie,
do they give me back my money?

20:21.568 --> 20:23.562
You don't have to worry.

20:23.568 --> 20:26.568
I mean, we're full steam ahead here.

20:37.568 --> 20:39.562
What's this?

20:39.568 --> 20:42.562
That's a list of areas
with tax incentives.

20:42.568 --> 20:45.562
Movie takes place in England,

20:45.568 --> 20:47.849
we'll probably shoot in
Vancouver, or somewhere like that.

20:49.568 --> 20:50.563
Nevada?

20:50.569 --> 20:52.562
Yeah, Nevada, good tax incentive,

20:52.568 --> 20:54.562
not a good visual match.

20:54.568 --> 20:56.568
We need English gardens, not deserts.

20:58.568 --> 21:00.568
And there's no crew in Nevada.

21:01.568 --> 21:03.568
I get you a crew.

21:04.568 --> 21:05.563
No, I mean, union guys.

21:05.569 --> 21:08.568
I can get cooks, drivers.

21:10.568 --> 21:11.563
From the casino?

21:11.569 --> 21:13.562
I know all kind of people, Ricky.

21:13.568 --> 21:15.568
And I give you a good price.

21:21.568 --> 21:23.568
Can I get a decaf macchiato, please?

21:31.568 --> 21:32.563
Double shot Americano?

21:32.569 --> 21:34.568
That's me, thanks.

21:51.568 --> 21:53.562
What you working on?

21:58.568 --> 22:00.088
I wasn't trying to be weird, I just...

22:05.568 --> 22:06.888
She thought I was hitting on her.

22:08.568 --> 22:10.608
I just wanted to know what
her screenplay was about.

22:13.568 --> 22:14.568
Since I produce movies.

22:18.568 --> 22:20.562
I'm writing a screenplay.

22:20.568 --> 22:23.562
You ever sell one?

22:23.568 --> 22:25.562
Had a few nibbles.

22:25.568 --> 22:27.562
This one's about Dresden
in the seventeenhundreds.

22:27.568 --> 22:30.568
It's called The Rebel of Liebstadt.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.568
That is a good title.

22:39.568 --> 22:43.562
Quick word about our new PA.

22:43.568 --> 22:46.562
You guys are friends, that's so cool.

22:46.568 --> 22:49.562
Yeah. I'm gonna need you to let him go.

22:49.568 --> 22:52.562
- Why?
- It's not working out.

22:52.568 --> 22:54.562
- Because?
- Not a good fit.

22:54.568 --> 22:56.562
Well, he's got a good attitude.

22:56.568 --> 22:57.568
Yeah, he does.

23:00.568 --> 23:02.562
You want me to tell him
that it's not working out,

23:02.568 --> 23:05.568
- because he's not a good fit.
- Thanks, Gladys.

23:15.568 --> 23:16.563
Hi.

23:16.569 --> 23:19.562
Holy shit! You answered.

23:19.568 --> 23:22.562
I'm completely unprepared

23:22.568 --> 23:25.562
for a conversation with
a real human being. Um...

23:25.568 --> 23:27.562
We're coming tomorrow.

23:27.568 --> 23:29.562
Yes, you... You're bringing
me one of my actors.

23:29.568 --> 23:32.562
She's been rehearsing her
lines on an endless loop.

23:32.568 --> 23:34.562
So if she backs out, I can step in.

23:34.568 --> 23:38.568
I'm not sure you could pass as a
twelveyearold. Fourteen, maybe.

23:39.568 --> 23:41.562
Thanks for being patient.

23:41.568 --> 23:44.562
I'm not being patient, Katie,
I just don't have a choice.

23:44.568 --> 23:47.562
There's just some
questions I need to answer,

23:47.568 --> 23:50.568
for everyone's sake. I've
almost got 'em figured out.

23:52.568 --> 23:55.562
Like, emotional questions?
What are you talking about?

23:55.568 --> 23:58.562
Ms. Daly? Attorney Bates.

23:58.568 --> 24:00.562
Hi, let me get off the phone.

24:00.568 --> 24:03.562
Miles, I gotta go, I'll see
you tomorrow at three. Bye.

24:03.568 --> 24:04.568
How are you? Please.

24:13.568 --> 24:17.562
Hey, Walon, right?

24:17.568 --> 24:18.563
Rick Moreweather.

24:18.569 --> 24:20.562
Listen, um, did you book
the conference room tomorrow?

24:20.568 --> 24:22.562
Right.

24:22.568 --> 24:23.563
Okay, good, 'cause we need to
get in there for a table read,

24:23.569 --> 24:25.562
they said you guys don't
need it till the evening.

24:25.568 --> 24:27.562
So, if we could get
in there in the afternoon...

24:27.568 --> 24:30.562
You made those giant spider movies.

24:30.568 --> 24:31.563
Yeah. That was a while ago.

24:31.569 --> 24:33.562
That must make for
an interesting table read.

24:33.568 --> 24:35.562
Do the actors play spiders?

24:38.568 --> 24:40.562
So you guys, you in there for the day?

24:40.568 --> 24:43.562
'Cause, we'll, we'll
leave you all set up.

24:43.568 --> 24:44.608
Can't help you, my friend.

24:48.568 --> 24:49.562
Asshole.

24:49.568 --> 24:50.563
He work down there?

24:50.569 --> 24:52.569
Yeah, it's okay, come on.
We'll find another place.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.562
I need you to call me back ASAP.

25:03.568 --> 25:07.562
I have found a writer,
got a writing sample.

25:07.568 --> 25:10.562
Title's in a foreign language, so...

25:10.568 --> 25:13.562
Probably good. But I need you
to check it before we go...

25:13.568 --> 25:16.562
Hey, you got a call from... Sorry.

25:16.568 --> 25:18.562
No, it's okay. I'm off.

25:18.568 --> 25:20.562
April's office called.

25:20.568 --> 25:22.562
They were hoping to get those
new pages from you by tonight.

25:22.568 --> 25:25.562
I just got the notes this morning.

25:25.568 --> 25:27.562
Well, they said it was just a few lines.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.568
Yeah, well, why don't they
write it, if they think it's so easy.

25:37.568 --> 25:40.568
You know, I read your first draft,

25:41.568 --> 25:43.568
even before Rick got it.

25:44.568 --> 25:45.568
It was wonderful.

25:46.568 --> 25:48.568
I think you're gonna be fine.

25:50.568 --> 25:51.568
Want to get dinner?

25:57.568 --> 25:59.568
When?

26:00.568 --> 26:02.568
Anytime. Just, like, tomorrow, or...

26:06.568 --> 26:07.848
You pick the place, let me know.

26:15.568 --> 26:16.563
I'm not sure I understand.

26:16.569 --> 26:19.562
Well, hypothetically, if
someone had a business,

26:19.568 --> 26:21.562
like, if they were a movie producer,

26:21.568 --> 26:26.562
and an investor were using
money from an illegal business.

26:26.568 --> 26:28.562
Could that producer get in trouble?

26:28.568 --> 26:30.768
Depends on what they knew
about the origin of the money.

26:31.568 --> 26:33.562
Or what could be proved.

26:33.568 --> 26:37.562
And if the producer wanted
to keep making movies,

26:37.568 --> 26:39.562
but didn't wanna be...

26:39.568 --> 26:41.562
- Legally culpable?
- Right.

26:41.568 --> 26:44.568
They'd have to insulate themselves
from the source of the money.

26:46.568 --> 26:49.568
And how would they do that?
I mean, hypothetically?

26:51.568 --> 26:54.562
I'll tell you what he said,
but in my opinion, Bob,

26:54.568 --> 26:55.563
you don't want any part of this.

26:55.569 --> 26:57.562
- Why not?
- I called Danny.

26:57.568 --> 26:59.562
The does plan checks for
residential inspections,

26:59.568 --> 27:01.562
and I said, "Danny?"

27:01.568 --> 27:02.563
"I have a man trying
to build his dream pool,

27:02.569 --> 27:06.562
"and he needs our help."
Danny says, "No problem."

27:06.568 --> 27:08.562
- Really?
- And he can get permits inside of a week.

27:08.568 --> 27:11.562
- Holy shit!
- But then, then Danny said...

27:11.568 --> 27:13.562
I can't believe I'm repeating this.

27:13.568 --> 27:16.562
He said, because his job's at risk,

27:16.568 --> 27:18.562
he wants ten grand in cash.

27:18.568 --> 27:20.562
That's what I said. I said,

27:20.568 --> 27:22.608
"Bob will not want to have
any part of this, Danny."

27:26.568 --> 27:28.562
- Seems kind of shady.
- Extremely shady.

27:28.568 --> 27:30.562
Yeah. I mean, truth be told,

27:30.568 --> 27:32.562
I, I... Yeah.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.562
Spend that much in rent and
attorney's fees in a month.

27:34.568 --> 27:35.577
Yeah, you're not gonna
wanna get involved

27:35.584 --> 27:36.562
in this kind of thing at all, Bob.

27:36.568 --> 27:38.562
- Yeah... Shit... No...
- I mean, I can't believe it.

27:38.568 --> 27:41.562
I mean, if I had thought that
Danny would pull this kind of shit,

27:41.568 --> 27:43.562
I would never have brought it up.

27:43.568 --> 27:46.562
Yeah. Yeah.

27:46.568 --> 27:48.568
- The food here is good value, isn't it?
- Yeah.

27:53.568 --> 27:57.562
This is not a reflection
of your performance.

27:57.568 --> 28:00.562
I mean, I thought the
job was longer than a day.

28:00.568 --> 28:03.562
But I met some

28:03.568 --> 28:05.568
really cool people so...

28:06.568 --> 28:07.563
Thank you.

28:07.569 --> 28:12.562
- Please don't thank me.
- Yeah, I'll clear out my desk.

28:12.568 --> 28:15.562
I don't have a desk, but
I'll just grab my backpack.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.568
Thanks again!

28:20.568 --> 28:21.568
Comin'!

28:26.568 --> 28:27.563
What's up, dog?

28:27.569 --> 28:29.568
Hey! I thought it was room service.

28:31.568 --> 28:33.562
Okay, she's in the shower.

28:33.568 --> 28:36.568
No, no, no, no. I want
to talk to you. Come here.

28:37.568 --> 28:39.562
Okay.

28:39.568 --> 28:40.563
Listen, you know I've been really busy,

28:40.569 --> 28:43.562
so I haven't been involved
in the whole movie thing.

28:43.568 --> 28:45.562
But last night I was watching.

28:45.568 --> 28:48.562
Paranormal Activity.
You ever seen that shit?

28:48.568 --> 28:49.563
I don't think so.

28:49.569 --> 28:51.562
You, you gotta check that shit out.

28:51.568 --> 28:55.562
Anyway, I realized that being
around artistic people, like you,

28:55.568 --> 28:57.562
- that's some interesting shit.
- Yeah.

28:57.568 --> 29:01.562
And I heard my Tia say
that you have some table meeting?

29:01.568 --> 29:02.563
I really want to go.

29:02.569 --> 29:04.562
To the table read?

29:04.568 --> 29:05.563
- Table read, yeah.
- Yeah.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.568
And I wanna invite my buddy, Bliz?

29:09.568 --> 29:13.562
Yeah! Yeah, okay, it's at 3:00.

29:13.568 --> 29:15.562
- I'll get you a drive on.
- That's very cool.

29:15.568 --> 29:16.563
Thank you, dog.

29:16.569 --> 29:18.562
I'm looking forward to that creativity.

29:18.568 --> 29:21.562
Yeah! Me, too.

29:22.569 --> 29:24.568
- All right!
- All right.

29:40.568 --> 29:42.562
You must be Bob.

29:42.568 --> 29:44.562
Danny, right?

29:44.568 --> 29:46.562
Hey, thanks for helping me out.

29:46.568 --> 29:48.562
Yeah, we're helping each other out.

29:48.568 --> 29:51.562
Here's a little, little
something for your effort.

29:51.568 --> 29:53.562
Yeah...

29:53.568 --> 29:56.562
So what kind of a...
Timeline we're looking here?

29:56.568 --> 29:59.568
- Rudy was saying that we...
- Yeah.

30:20.568 --> 30:21.563
Five seconds with that guy,

30:21.569 --> 30:23.568
I knew he was a shit bird.

30:27.568 --> 30:29.562
Should we go on, maybe?

30:29.568 --> 30:32.568
Man, the writer
still hasn't sent the pages.

30:33.568 --> 30:35.562
I fuckin' hate deadlines.

30:35.568 --> 30:38.562
I mean, he was at his day
job, earlier, but, I mean,

30:38.568 --> 30:40.562
he's been home for two hours!

30:40.568 --> 30:41.562
What's his day job?

30:41.568 --> 30:42.563
Valet.

30:42.569 --> 30:44.562
He...

30:44.568 --> 30:46.562
Well, at least if his writing is shite,

30:46.568 --> 30:47.563
it's not like Brandon
will shut down the movie,

30:47.569 --> 30:49.562
and then Amara will have us both killed.

30:49.568 --> 30:51.562
- Yeah, okay. I...
- No, wait a minute.

30:51.568 --> 30:52.563
That is what will happen.

30:52.569 --> 30:54.929
I'll call him as soon as we
get back to the apartment. Okay?

30:56.568 --> 30:57.563
A fucking valet?

30:57.569 --> 30:59.562
Quit bugging me, man.

30:59.568 --> 31:01.568
Got a lot of stress.

31:15.568 --> 31:18.568
Front desk called, said
she's on her way up.

31:21.568 --> 31:22.568
You sure about this?

31:24.568 --> 31:25.568
I'm curious.

31:40.568 --> 31:42.568
Hello, Amara. Ed.

31:44.568 --> 31:45.563
Thanks for seeing me.

31:45.569 --> 31:47.568
Miles give you my phone number?

31:48.568 --> 31:50.568
I've had it for years.

31:51.568 --> 31:53.562
Lots of men work for me.

31:53.568 --> 31:56.562
I don't talk to their wife.

31:56.568 --> 31:58.568
Then I'm glad you made an exception.

31:59.568 --> 32:02.568
Can I sit? I have a lot to say.

32:14.568 --> 32:17.568
It's great, what you're
doing with the film.

32:18.568 --> 32:20.562
It's exciting, and I'm,

32:20.568 --> 32:23.568
I'm sure there's a
practical benefit, as well.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.608
What do you know about it?

32:28.568 --> 32:30.562
I came to say,

32:30.568 --> 32:34.562
I think there's an
opportunity, moving forward.

32:34.568 --> 32:36.568
For you and for Miles.

32:38.568 --> 32:40.568
And you?

32:41.568 --> 32:43.568
For all of us.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.562
Hey!

32:51.568 --> 32:52.563
Thanks for letting us use
that conference room, really.

32:52.569 --> 32:54.562
Okay? We're gonna keep it
spick and span, trust me.

32:54.568 --> 32:57.562
- Yeah, it's all yours.
- Okay.

32:57.568 --> 32:58.568
Whoaho! What happened?

33:00.568 --> 33:03.562
I was coming down the stairs

33:03.568 --> 33:06.562
in the parking garage, and I twisted it.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.562
Stairs in the back, right?

33:08.568 --> 33:09.563
And I hate those freaking stairs!

33:09.569 --> 33:12.568
Yeah, this whole place is a death trap.

33:20.568 --> 33:21.563
Lindsay, right?

33:21.569 --> 33:23.562
Yeah.

33:23.568 --> 33:24.563
Rudy.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.562
We met at the bar the other night.

33:26.568 --> 33:29.562
That's right. Good
memory. Hey there, Bob!

33:29.568 --> 33:31.568
- Wait a second.
- Cheers, Lindsay.

33:35.568 --> 33:36.562
What are you doing here?

33:36.568 --> 33:37.563
Just dropping in.

33:37.569 --> 33:40.562
And, I thought I'd
run something by you.

33:40.568 --> 33:41.568
How'd you get on the lot?

33:42.568 --> 33:44.562
Gate three.

33:44.568 --> 33:46.568
- But don't you...
- You have no windows, Bob.

33:49.568 --> 33:51.562
You might go a little mad down here,

33:51.568 --> 33:54.568
with just filing
cabinets and spreadsheets.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.562
What did you want to run by me?

33:58.568 --> 33:59.568
Yes.

34:03.568 --> 34:05.562
I need a favor.

34:05.568 --> 34:06.832
Okay.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.949
You have a project here called
The Admiral's Mistress.

34:08.973 --> 34:10.967
I hear it's great.

34:10.974 --> 34:13.614
I need you to sign off on the
budget, so they can start production.

34:14.568 --> 34:16.562
What's your connection?

34:16.568 --> 34:20.562
I just thought, seeing
as I'm doing you a favor,

34:20.568 --> 34:23.562
helping you to bribe
a government employee,

34:23.568 --> 34:25.562
which I think is a fucking felony, Bob,

34:25.568 --> 34:28.199
I just thought maybe you
could help me with this.

34:37.568 --> 34:40.562
When we first met at the
bar, you knew who I was?

34:40.568 --> 34:41.568
You told me who you were.

34:45.568 --> 34:50.562
You're helping me out,
and I, I appreciate that.

34:50.568 --> 34:52.562
But what you're asking is, you know...

34:52.568 --> 34:57.562
You want tickets
to a premiere, um, I'm your guy.

34:57.568 --> 34:59.562
Um, box set of, DVDs...

34:59.568 --> 35:01.562
The production budget, Bob, would
you say that's in this office

35:01.568 --> 35:03.728
or would Lindsay have it in
one of her filing cabinets?

35:05.568 --> 35:08.562
Thanks for stopping by, Rudy. You
want to call me later, let me know.

35:08.568 --> 35:09.563
Sit down, Bob.

35:09.569 --> 35:12.562
Who the fuck do you think you are?

35:12.568 --> 35:13.568
Get out of my office.

35:14.568 --> 35:17.562
Hey, Lindsay!

35:17.568 --> 35:19.562
I work for serious people, Bob.

35:19.568 --> 35:20.562
It's locked.

35:20.568 --> 35:21.563
You play games with us,

35:21.569 --> 35:23.562
we'll bury you under
the fucking foundations

35:23.568 --> 35:25.568
of that fancy house you're building.

35:26.568 --> 35:28.568
Did you need me?

35:30.568 --> 35:32.568
Say you want the budget.

35:39.568 --> 35:40.568
- Lindsay?
- Yeah?

35:41.568 --> 35:43.562
Could you bring us the 2D version

35:43.568 --> 35:47.568
of The Admiral's Mistress
production budget, please?

35:48.568 --> 35:49.568
Okay.

35:52.568 --> 35:53.568
Now you can sit down.

36:04.568 --> 36:06.562
Perfect! Thank you!

36:06.568 --> 36:09.568
Can I borrow that
pen? Cheers, Lindsay.

36:25.568 --> 36:29.568
It's a good investment,
Bob. In more ways than one.

36:37.568 --> 36:40.568
April, how are you?

36:45.568 --> 36:47.562
Dad.

36:47.568 --> 36:51.562
Hey! You're over there, with the talent.

36:51.568 --> 36:52.853
What if I mess up?

36:52.988 --> 36:54.961
Well, your dad's the producer, so you're

36:55.015 --> 36:57.029
probably not getting fired. Go on.

36:57.084 --> 36:59.078
There's a lot I want to say.

36:59.568 --> 37:00.562
Maybe at dinner?

37:00.568 --> 37:01.563
That sounds daunting.

37:01.569 --> 37:03.562
Any chance we might enjoy ourselves?

37:03.568 --> 37:05.562
I'm planning to enjoy it.

37:13.568 --> 37:15.562
- How'd it go?
- Good, I think.

37:15.568 --> 37:18.568
Well, I'm glad, 'cause
we've got a situation.

37:20.568 --> 37:21.568
What?

37:24.568 --> 37:26.562
What the fuck?

37:26.568 --> 37:28.562
Gladys!

37:28.568 --> 37:31.562
May I ask, what the fuck
Nathan is doing at the table?

37:31.568 --> 37:33.562
Lord Sheridan is a pivotal fucking role.

37:33.568 --> 37:34.563
We had actors who were unavailable,

37:34.569 --> 37:37.562
so I guess casting
got readers to sub in.

37:37.568 --> 37:39.562
Why are they using him?

37:39.568 --> 37:40.563
He must have
volunteered before I fired him.

37:40.569 --> 37:43.562
Have you heard him speak?
He sounds like Spicoli.

37:43.568 --> 37:46.562
Everybody, why don't
we get started?

37:46.568 --> 37:50.562
Please, you've, you've got your
assigned seats, we're all here.

37:50.568 --> 37:51.563
- It's okay.
- And, um...

37:51.569 --> 37:54.562
We're happy you're here. And tell
you what, we're gonna turn it over

37:54.568 --> 37:57.562
to your director now. Hafdis!

37:57.568 --> 37:59.562
- Hey!
- Yeah, whenever you're ready.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.562
Can you hear me?

38:01.568 --> 38:02.563
Yes, we can hear you.

38:02.569 --> 38:06.562
Okay, great. Well, welcome everybody.

38:06.568 --> 38:10.562
So glad you can, yeah, all join
us on this very special day.

38:10.568 --> 38:15.562
Such an exciting
project, I'm so thrilled!

38:15.568 --> 38:19.562
But now, let us begin.

38:20.569 --> 38:22.568
Great! Let's go!

38:28.568 --> 38:30.562
Exterior, Munro Estates, evening.

38:30.568 --> 38:34.562
Rolling hills give way to
chalk cliffs and gray ocean.

38:34.568 --> 38:38.562
Reveal Lord Munro, handsome
despite his lined visage.

38:38.568 --> 38:40.562
With him is Lady Margaret.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.562
Are you certain Lord
Culph will attend the ball?

38:42.568 --> 38:44.562
Quite sure.

38:44.568 --> 38:47.562
Lillian is not so foolish
as to hope for an audience,

38:47.568 --> 38:49.562
but she would lay eyes on him.

38:49.568 --> 38:53.562
His Lordship has many
obligations, she is not among them.

38:53.568 --> 38:55.562
You, on the other hand...

38:55.568 --> 38:59.562
Felton approaches Margaret and her
smile betrays her pleasure at seeing him.

38:59.568 --> 39:03.562
I hear my lady is to attend a
ball at Sumerford this evening.

39:03.568 --> 39:07.562
A recentlyacquired cough
may prevent me from attending.

39:07.568 --> 39:09.562
- A cough?
- Margaret gives a fake cough.

39:12.568 --> 39:16.562
Sounds serious.

39:16.568 --> 39:18.562
But if I were feeling well
enough to take a walk later,

39:18.568 --> 39:21.562
and you were to leave your
mother's house to get some air,

39:21.568 --> 39:25.562
it isn't impossible that
we might pass each other by.

39:25.568 --> 39:28.568
They're interrupted by the
sudden appearance of Kitty,

39:29.568 --> 39:32.568
a servant girl carrying
a basket of laundry.

39:33.568 --> 39:34.563
Felton!

39:34.569 --> 39:38.562
Kitty drops the laundry and embraces
Felton. Margaret looks on wistfully.

39:38.568 --> 39:41.562
They said you weren't coming
back, but I wouldn't believe them.

39:41.568 --> 39:45.562
Kitty, dear, not in front of
the lady, it's overfamiliar.

39:45.568 --> 39:47.562
- Sorry, milady.
- Nonsense.

39:47.568 --> 39:52.562
You wish to embrace an old
friend. Who could blame you?

39:52.568 --> 39:56.562
Blushing, Kitty picks up her basket
of laundry and excuses herself.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.562
Unable to contain her smile,

39:58.568 --> 40:01.568
Felton watches her go and slowly
turns to gaze upon the house.

40:06.568 --> 40:07.568
In here.

40:18.568 --> 40:20.568
Two grand, right?

40:23.568 --> 40:25.562
Is this a police station?

40:25.568 --> 40:27.562
EightyEighth Precinct
on Compton Justice.

40:27.568 --> 40:28.563
Yo, for real?

40:28.569 --> 40:30.568
My mom's be watching that show.

40:39.568 --> 40:42.459
Got any movie or TV friends need

40:42.466 --> 40:45.562
a hookup, tell them to give us a shout.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.568
- Cool.
- Hey, y'all. Check it out.

40:48.568 --> 40:49.563
They got me, bro.

40:49.569 --> 40:52.568
I'm looking at some serious time.

40:54.568 --> 40:56.562
A 12yearold stable
boy readies a horse.

40:56.568 --> 40:58.562
Behind him, Lord Henry Sheridan enters.

40:58.568 --> 41:00.562
Shit, here we go.

41:00.568 --> 41:02.562
Outwardly handsome but with
something dark at his core,

41:02.568 --> 41:04.562
dressed in full riding gear,

41:04.568 --> 41:05.563
Sheridan approaches.

41:05.569 --> 41:07.568
Fuck's sake!

41:09.568 --> 41:11.562
- You.
- Yes, sir?

41:11.568 --> 41:14.568
I wished to ride the bay, but now
I find the roan has been saddled.

41:16.568 --> 41:17.563
The stable master gave you instructions,

41:17.569 --> 41:19.562
still you saddled the wrong horse.

41:19.568 --> 41:20.728
Is it me? Or is he all right?

41:21.568 --> 41:23.562
- I mean...
- Yeah.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.568
- I'll fix it, sir...
- I did not say you can move.

41:26.568 --> 41:28.568
Look at me when I'm addressing you.

41:32.569 --> 41:34.562
The boy forces his gaze upwards.

41:34.568 --> 41:36.562
Please, sir, it will not happen again.

41:36.568 --> 41:38.562
No, it won't,

41:38.568 --> 41:42.562
as I shall whip you bloody in order
to fix the incident in your memory,

41:42.568 --> 41:46.568
and ensure you don't
disappoint me next Sunday.

41:47.568 --> 41:48.563
Take off your shirt.

41:48.569 --> 41:51.562
Weeping, the boy pulls off his shirt.

41:51.568 --> 41:54.568
Since I have made your
daughter's acquaintance,

41:55.568 --> 41:57.568
I cannot sleep.

41:58.568 --> 41:59.568
I cannot eat.

42:00.568 --> 42:02.568
I am a shadow of my former self.

42:06.568 --> 42:08.568
If the lady does not
return my affections,

42:11.568 --> 42:14.562
I ask her to put me out of my misery.

42:14.568 --> 42:17.562
I think you will be very
pleased with her answer.

42:20.568 --> 42:23.562
Sheridan bolts the door behind him,

42:23.568 --> 42:25.568
Margaret starts to back away.

42:27.568 --> 42:28.563
Do not come near me.

42:28.569 --> 42:33.562
A man may treat his
property as he desires.

42:33.568 --> 42:37.562
He may shatter a dish,
he may beat his dog.

42:37.568 --> 42:41.215
And he may bed the woman
who's to be his wife,

42:41.568 --> 42:43.568
with force, if necessary.

42:45.568 --> 42:46.568
You are a scoundrel.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.568
One who is to share a
bed with you tomorrow.

42:54.568 --> 42:56.695
He's pretty fuckin' good, isn't he?

42:57.568 --> 43:01.562
Track with Margaret as she walks
to the cliffs. Camera rises up.

43:01.568 --> 43:07.562
As the sun sets on the day, and
on a lifetime of regret. The end.

43:14.568 --> 43:15.568
Beautiful.

43:18.568 --> 43:22.568
Wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful. Hafdis, anything?

43:24.568 --> 43:27.562
That was beautiful. Thank you!

43:27.568 --> 43:30.562
- Yes, I know.
- Shut that off. Shut that off.

43:30.568 --> 43:33.562
Hey, everybody, there's plenty of
lunch here that's gonna go to waste.

43:33.568 --> 43:35.562
Thank you very much.

43:36.569 --> 43:39.562
- That went okay.
- Those new lines really worked. Right?

43:39.568 --> 43:41.562
Read like a house on
fire. Don't you think?

43:41.568 --> 43:43.562
- Yeah.
- And how about our new Lord Sheridan?

43:43.568 --> 43:45.562
No, no, he's just a reader.

43:45.568 --> 43:46.563
No, no, not anymore.

43:46.569 --> 43:48.568
He's twice as good as the actor we had.

43:50.568 --> 43:52.568
We're not doing this, right?

43:53.568 --> 43:54.563
I don't know...

43:54.569 --> 43:56.562
I mean, his roommate
wrote the fuckin' script.

43:56.568 --> 43:59.568
- How long before he puts the pieces together?
- I don't know, Lulu.

44:00.568 --> 44:02.562
Don't do this.

44:02.568 --> 44:04.562
He was fuckin' brilliant!

44:04.568 --> 44:06.562
We can't go back to the other guy now.

44:06.568 --> 44:09.562
- Yeah, we can.
- We gotta do what's best for the movie.

44:09.568 --> 44:11.562
- Hey.
- That was fun. Can't wait to do it again.

44:12.569 --> 44:14.562
It always ends really well
for child stars, right?

44:14.568 --> 44:17.562
Come on, let's get you
a donut or something.

44:21.568 --> 44:25.562
The great cast, the
ocean battle, the drama...

44:25.568 --> 44:29.562
It left me wondering... Why
was it so fucking boring?

44:29.568 --> 44:31.562
I told you that wasn't my experience.

44:31.568 --> 44:33.562
I wanted to crawl
under the table and go to sleep.

44:33.568 --> 44:36.562
I still think there's a
builtin audience for this.

44:36.568 --> 44:38.562
Yeah, well, Bob Grace agrees with you.

44:38.568 --> 44:40.562
- What?
- Messages?

44:40.568 --> 44:43.562
Bob ran projections for
domestic and international,

44:43.568 --> 44:45.562
says there's a significant upside.

44:45.568 --> 44:47.568
Beats the hell outta me.

44:49.568 --> 44:52.562
- Look at these heavy hitters.
- Fantastic.

44:52.568 --> 44:56.562
You liked it? All I have to
say is, "Let's make a movie!"

44:56.568 --> 44:59.562
Yes! All right!

45:01.568 --> 45:03.562
Let's sit down, talk about a start date.

45:03.568 --> 45:05.168
You know, I've never
even been to Nevada.

45:05.569 --> 45:07.562
Nevada?

45:07.568 --> 45:09.562
Where we're shooting.

45:09.568 --> 45:10.975
Yeah, I've been CC'ing you on all those

45:10.982 --> 45:12.562
emails. The locations with rebates.

45:12.568 --> 45:14.562
He actually lives in Nevada.

45:14.568 --> 45:16.568
Yeah, it's just, um...

45:17.568 --> 45:21.568
England is very lush and green.

45:22.568 --> 45:23.648
Nevada is a fuckin' desert.

45:24.568 --> 45:26.562
With rebates.

45:26.568 --> 45:27.563
And Rick and Amara got
us a deal on local crew.

45:27.569 --> 45:30.568
So all that money goes to the screen!

45:32.568 --> 45:34.568
That's fucking brilliant.

45:45.568 --> 45:46.563
Three questions, from me to you.

45:46.569 --> 45:49.562
For each correct answer
about a travel destination.

45:49.568 --> 45:51.562
- Hello?
- Mom! Mom!

45:51.568 --> 45:55.562
- Hi, honey. It's Nathan.
- I got a part!

45:55.568 --> 45:56.563
A what?

45:56.569 --> 45:59.562
Yeah, I'm playing the lead!

45:59.568 --> 46:01.562
Says he's playing a lead.

46:01.568 --> 46:02.563
What's that mean?

46:02.569 --> 46:04.562
Dad's asking, what's that mean?

46:04.568 --> 46:06.562
That the producers liked me,

46:06.568 --> 46:08.562
so they're giving me a big role.

46:08.568 --> 46:10.562
I know I said it would happen sooner,

46:10.568 --> 46:11.563
you know, and it's
already been nine months.

46:11.569 --> 46:16.562
But they're paying me scale.
And I can send you 60 grand...

46:16.568 --> 46:17.562
60 what?

46:17.568 --> 46:18.568
Thousand, thousand.

46:20.568 --> 46:22.562
Hey, my phone's dying, I, I
got to find somewhere to charge.

46:22.568 --> 46:25.562
Um, I'll call tomorrow? Love to Dad.

46:25.568 --> 46:27.562
Bye, bye, bye!

46:29.568 --> 46:32.568
Sends his love.

46:35.568 --> 46:38.568
He says he's sending us $60,000.

46:39.568 --> 46:40.568
He sound high?

46:41.568 --> 46:43.568
Maybe.

46:44.568 --> 46:45.568
At least he's not dead.

46:46.568 --> 46:47.568
There's that.

46:56.568 --> 46:58.568
Lot of old people here.

46:59.568 --> 47:02.562
And tourists.

47:02.568 --> 47:06.568
But I dig it, and you
were very sweet to take me.

47:10.568 --> 47:14.562
That's a nice
red, it's not too expensive.

47:14.568 --> 47:17.562
Yeah, you have it, I don't drink.

47:21.569 --> 47:24.562
No, no. I'm a Mormon.

47:30.568 --> 47:31.568
Are you?

47:34.568 --> 47:38.562
I mean, Mormons are fascinating.

47:38.568 --> 47:40.562
Um, I'm glad that you think so.

47:43.568 --> 47:45.562
No coffee, and no booze, right?

47:45.568 --> 47:48.562
Well, no smoking, no caffeine.

47:48.568 --> 47:51.562
No premarital sex, no drugs.

47:51.568 --> 47:52.568
Those are the biggies.

47:54.568 --> 47:55.562
No sex?

47:55.568 --> 47:56.568
No premarital sex.

47:58.568 --> 48:00.568
You just make out?

48:03.568 --> 48:05.568
You can't make out?

48:06.568 --> 48:12.568
You can, just without a lot
of intensity, or for very long...

48:14.568 --> 48:16.562
I feel like you're
bumping on this...

48:16.568 --> 48:19.568
So what is all of this leading up to?

48:20.568 --> 48:25.568
Well, ideally, a very
intimate friendship.

48:27.568 --> 48:29.175
And, well, if things progress...

48:31.568 --> 48:33.562
We get married?

48:37.568 --> 48:38.888
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

48:47.568 --> 48:52.562
So, I should just say, the
whole "not having sex" thing,

48:52.568 --> 48:54.568
that probably won't work for me.

48:58.568 --> 48:59.568
Okay.

49:12.568 --> 49:15.562
I was so nervous, and then Max
Kisbye came over and he was so nice!

49:15.568 --> 49:18.562
But it was so weird, because I'm used to
seeing him in, like, all of his movies?

49:18.568 --> 49:23.562
- And he's really different in real life.
- Who's she talking to?

49:23.568 --> 49:26.562
Every 12yearold in southern Nevada.

49:26.568 --> 49:28.562
Acting, I said, "Am I into acting?"

49:28.568 --> 49:31.562
Weren't we gonna have a conversation?

49:31.568 --> 49:33.562
After dinner.

49:33.568 --> 49:37.562
After dinner, before sex? Or
after dinner before an argument?

49:51.568 --> 49:52.608
You still have that house?

49:57.568 --> 49:59.568
Are you saying you want to live with me?

50:00.568 --> 50:01.563
'Cause to be honest I'm kind of enjoying

50:01.569 --> 50:04.562
the setup that myself
and Lulu have here.

50:04.568 --> 50:05.563
Yeah, I get it.

50:05.569 --> 50:08.562
It's a lot of good amenities,

50:08.568 --> 50:12.562
on site dry cleaners,
personal hairstylists.

50:12.568 --> 50:14.562
Have you run this by Emma?

50:14.568 --> 50:17.562
Well, I thought we'd do that together.

50:17.568 --> 50:19.562
I mean, let's be honest.

50:19.568 --> 50:21.047
If she doesn't want to move, we're still

50:21.054 --> 50:22.562
gonna make her, she's fuckin' 12.

50:28.568 --> 50:30.562
Something else.

50:30.568 --> 50:32.562
You want me to see if I can
bring the hairstylist with me?

50:32.568 --> 50:34.568
I knew you were gonna ask.

50:35.568 --> 50:36.568
About Amara.

50:41.568 --> 50:44.562
Okay, look, if your job
really is making movies,

50:44.568 --> 50:49.562
and you happen to be using Amara's
money? I can live with that.

50:49.568 --> 50:52.562
But realistically, there's
no way she lets you walk away

50:52.568 --> 50:55.562
when the movie's done.

50:55.568 --> 50:58.562
Didn't you just say that you were
happy to live with me?

50:58.568 --> 51:01.562
Well, Amara being involved
isn't a dealbreaker.

51:01.568 --> 51:04.568
I mean, people in her
position don't last forever.

51:06.568 --> 51:09.568
But if she goes down, I
don't want you going with her.

51:11.568 --> 51:12.563
So I met with a lawyer...

51:12.569 --> 51:14.562
Come on...

51:14.568 --> 51:19.562
And he said if Amara forms
a shell company and an LLC...

51:19.568 --> 51:20.563
Whatever the fuck that is.

51:20.569 --> 51:22.562
Well, it's what she
does with her casino.

51:22.568 --> 51:25.562
Then she can fund as
many movies as she wants,

51:25.568 --> 51:27.562
and you're not implicated.

51:27.568 --> 51:31.562
I mean, she lets you
be a fulltime producer.

51:31.568 --> 51:33.562
We don't know if she's
gonna agree to that.

51:33.568 --> 51:34.568
She will.

51:35.568 --> 51:36.568
She did.

51:38.568 --> 51:41.562
I mean, we didn't get into the
details, but she liked the basic...

51:41.568 --> 51:43.466
You spoke to Amara?

51:44.568 --> 51:45.568
In her hotel.

51:46.568 --> 51:47.568
No.

51:50.568 --> 51:52.562
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

51:52.568 --> 51:53.563
I'm trying to get us
away from this woman,

51:53.569 --> 51:55.562
and you're having chats
with her at the hotel?

51:55.568 --> 51:57.562
Did you bring Emma,

51:57.568 --> 52:00.562
or was she having a smoke
with Ed in the fuckin' lobby?

52:00.569 --> 52:02.747
If I'd told you, you
wouldn't have let me!

52:02.820 --> 52:04.062
No, shit.

52:05.568 --> 52:09.562
Katie, you think you understand
this woman, you're out of your depth.

52:09.568 --> 52:12.568
If I want to be with you, I don't
have a lot of fucking options here.

52:14.568 --> 52:15.563
Baby...

52:15.569 --> 52:19.562
At least it gets us out of Nevada.

52:19.568 --> 52:21.568
Did I mention where
we're shooting the movie?

52:24.568 --> 52:25.563
What?

52:25.569 --> 52:27.568
Are we celebrating or not?

52:28.568 --> 52:29.568
Hello?

53:00.568 --> 53:01.563
Mr. Moreweather?

53:01.569 --> 53:05.568
Agents Ware and Buchholz,
FBI. You have a minute?

53:08.568 --> 53:09.728
Could I see that badge again?

53:12.568 --> 53:14.648
- That's real?
- Yes, sir.

53:17.568 --> 53:18.568
Yeah.

53:29.568 --> 53:32.562
Yeah, I'm, expecting company, so...

53:32.568 --> 53:33.563
How long do we have?

53:33.569 --> 53:36.562
20 minutes.

53:36.568 --> 53:39.568
Better get to it.
Is it all right if we sit?

53:41.568 --> 53:42.568
Yeah.

53:53.568 --> 53:55.300
Amara de Escalones runs the southern

53:55.307 --> 53:57.562
Nevada branch of Los Chapulines cartel.

53:57.568 --> 54:00.568
Heard of Los Chapulines?
Guardianes de la Muerte?

54:05.568 --> 54:07.562
Mr. Moreweather.

54:07.568 --> 54:09.562
Amara is currently
expanding her territory

54:09.568 --> 54:12.562
into northern and northwestern Nevada.

54:12.568 --> 54:16.568
She had 12 men shot to
death in Indian Springs.

54:17.568 --> 54:18.563
And before that...

54:18.569 --> 54:21.568
This was a business partner of Amara's.

54:22.568 --> 54:25.568
This was a lover. Lover.

54:27.568 --> 54:29.562
Lover.

54:33.568 --> 54:35.568
Thanks for your time.
We'll let ourselves out.

54:37.568 --> 54:38.562
You're leaving?

54:38.568 --> 54:40.208
Yeah, we're just
bringing you up to speed.

54:41.568 --> 54:43.568
You ever want to talk about anything.

54:44.568 --> 54:46.568
Just give us a ring.

54:48.568 --> 54:52.568
But I'd burn that
before she gets here.

54:53.568 --> 54:54.568
Yeah.
