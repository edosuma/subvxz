there's a lotto sort out.

No, I-l get it, babe--
it's just that dinner,

-you know, is almost ready
and... -Theresa, I get it.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.236

about leaving your toys

01:54.581 --> 01:55.651
They're collectibles, Mom,

01:55.782 --> 01:57.056
-not toys.
- Well, please stop leaving

Mr. Danielson,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.997
we've done all we can.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.261
Okay, listen, uh,
is there any way

02:37.357 --> 02:39.030
I can get another extension?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.196
You're currently $40,000
in arrears,

02:41.328 --> 02:43.774
and the bank just can't sustain
debts like that,

02:43.864 --> 02:47.778
and we definitely can't see
a way into further credit.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.176
I understand. I understand.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.713
L... (sighs)

02:50.837 --> 02:52.680
I mean, nobody's building new
right now, okay'?

02:52.806 --> 02:54.808
And I've already laid off
over half my staff.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.319
I'm having a hard time
making payroll as it is.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.548
I'm really sorry.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.386
I wish there
was more I could do.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.391

03:02.516 --> 03:06.862
Okay. Uh... look, I-l know
it's a bit of a long shot here,

03:06.987 --> 03:08.796
but my daughter's about to sign

03:08.889 --> 03:11.165
her first major
recording deal, okay?

03:11.291 --> 03:13.032
So just give me
a little bit more time--

03:13.160 --> 03:15.697
maybe she can give me a loan,
I can work this all out.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.706
Mr. Danielson,
if you can't find a way

03:17.831 --> 03:19.708
to catch up

No, it's not okay.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.879
What if you got
into an accident?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.248
You could hurt yourself, or...

Or what, Mom?

04:36.409 --> 04:37.979

04:55.495 --> 04:58.271
Just a couple things.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.741

05:00.600 --> 05:01.806
Those are preferred contractors

05:01.935 --> 05:03.437

05:03.570 --> 05:05.174

05:05.305 --> 05:07.182
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.777
I'll tell you what, I will take
a long look at them tonight,

05:10.911 --> 05:12.822

she comes through those doors,

05:58.792 --> 06:01.796
it won't be
because she chose to,

06:01.895 --> 06:05.468

sent her to me.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.063
unless we get
a donor heart soon...

12:09.195 --> 12:11.903
- No, I want to talk to another
doctor. -Mr. Danielson,

12:12.031 --> 12:15.171
I am the senior cardiologist,
and I promise you...

12:15.268 --> 12:17.248
I don't want your promises;
I want a second opinion.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.043
And that's exactly
what I intend on getting.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.617
Now, who do you work for?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.083
I want to speak to your boss.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.687
I'll contact
our chief cardiologist

12:23.776 --> 12:25.756
and let her know
you wish to speak with her.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.959
<i>DMD:
They're there now'?</i>

12:33.086 --> 12:36.192
I thought we were meeting
with them this afternoon.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.361
{groans}

12:38.458 --> 12:41.200
ls old man Withers with them?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.898
Of course he is.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.600
(sighs):
All right. I'm on my way.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.040
DAVID:
Mm-hmm.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.376
Cecil?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.541
Yeah. That was
a scheduling mix-up.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.210
The building committee's
at the church waiting on me.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.881
Yeah. Hey, hey,
don't you worry, buddy.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.423
I'll be there to pick you up.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.219
- Okay.
- All right? I promise.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.259
I love you.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.557
(whispers):
You should.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.927
I do.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.897
{Theresa laughing)
- Bye, guys.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.663
CECIL: <i>All right,
I will show you guys out.</i>

13:12.792 --> 13:14.601
- Thank you, Cecil.
- All right.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.237
All right, thanks.
We'll make it work.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.438
(sighs)

13:21.567 --> 13:23.604
Well, that went well.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.080
(chuckles):
That's one way to describe it.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.080
Yeah, that was rough, but...

13:29.175 --> 13:31.621
you know, with all the
construction we got going on,

13:31.744 --> 13:33.451
you got to expect
some oversight.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.525
A lot of it, actually.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.286
I still don't get
why they would assign

13:37.417 --> 13:40.125
a third-party manager
to oversee us.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.132
Comes with the territory,
David.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.465
I'm reading her e-mail;
she just sent us one.

13:46.592 --> 13:47.798
Name's Lisa Pearl.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.497
And...

13:49.629 --> 13:51.700
- Pearl. -..-looks like
you're gonna meet her today,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.277
'cause she's coming here
at 2:30 to meet you.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.937
Today at 2:30?

13:56.035 --> 13:58.481
- That's what it says.
- Well, I can't do today.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.175
I'm taking Eric
to his basketball game.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.184
Well, better start working
on a plan B.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.016
David, at this stage
of the game,

14:05.144 --> 14:06.851
I really don't think
you can tell the new manager

14:06.979 --> 14:08.617
you can't meet with her

14:08.715 --> 14:11.525
'cause you got to pick
your son up for basketball.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.361
DAVID:
I'm sorry,

14:14.487 --> 14:15.659
but there's nothing I can do.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.131
This is a big game
for him, okay?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.827
He wants you there.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.699
You can't keep making promises
and not delivering.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.465
I know. I know.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.540
It's out of my control.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.336
David, you know
I love you, okay?

14:25.465 --> 14:26.876
But I've got
back-to-back meetings

14:26.999 --> 14:28.171
regarding
the women's retreat today,

14:28.301 --> 14:29.473
so I can't do it.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.173
I can't help. I'm sorry, baby.
I love you,

14:31.304 --> 14:33.045
but you got to figure
this one out by yourself.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.412
- Okay, honey?
- Yeah, right, okay.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.042
All right, I'll figure it out.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.347
Bye-bye.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.717
(sighs)

14:45.051 --> 14:46.359
CECIL:
Pastor.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.726
Oh, excuse us.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.925
Miss Pearl is here
to meet with you.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.697
Please, just call me Lisa.

14:52.825 --> 14:53.769
Will do.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.201
All right, well,
I know you guys got

14:55.328 --> 14:56.705
a lot of work to get to,

14:56.829 --> 14:59.867
and I'll leave you to it.
Nice to meet you, Lisa.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.770
I know I'm early, Pastor.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.610
I can wait in the lobby
until you're ready, if need be.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.581
Absolutely not.
I'm ready for you now.

15:07.707 --> 15:08.845
Oh, great.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.352
All right.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.225
Hey, Ma.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.259
Hi, baby.

15:17.383 --> 15:18.862
So, um...

15:18.951 --> 15:22.125
this is what
I've been looking at.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.467
This is a great college, Mommy.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.905
But it's so far.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.600
And so expensive.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.440
And who's gonna deliver
the orders if you leave?

15:36.536 --> 15:37.913
Please?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.983
Just think about it.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.744
I love you.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.377
(exhales)
I love you more.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.672
WOMAN (over P.A. system):
Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.768
This is my chief cardiologist,
Dr. Timmons.

16:07.900 --> 16:08.970
Thank you for coming.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.671
Uh, we would like
a second opinion

16:10.803 --> 16:12.282
regarding
my daughter's condition.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.511
Sir, Dr. Moore is
the senior cardiologist here,

16:15.641 --> 16:17.143
and an expert in his field.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.483
Frankly, I don't care
what he is, okay?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.421
I already told him,
now I'm telling you,

16:21.514 --> 16:23.187
I want another doctor
to look at my daughter.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.818
- We want a second opinion.
- John.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.692
- I will handle this.
- Sir, Dr. Moore is

16:26.819 --> 16:29.322
one of the top cardiologists
in the nation,

16:29.455 --> 16:31.492
and I've reviewed your
daughter's charts, her scan,

16:31.624 --> 16:33.365
her entire file,
and I absolutely agree

16:33.493 --> 16:36.099
-with his diagnosis.
- I don't think you understand.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.801
Sir, your daughter is
in the very best of care.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.877
- John, we just need to listen
to her... -No, you need

16:41.000 --> 16:42.206
to listen to me, okay?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.871
We want a second opinion,
and we will get one

16:44.003 --> 16:45.482
-if we have
to change hospitals. -No,

16:45.605 --> 16:48.108
- I want another doctor.
-we do not need another doctor.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.016
(sighs)
I've had enough.

16:50.142 --> 16:53.453
If this man is one of the best
in our nation,

16:53.546 --> 16:58.017
then he will do his job, and he
will take care of our daughter.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.460
You will take care
of our baby, right?

17:00.553 --> 17:02.726
If we get a donor's heart
in time...

17:02.855 --> 17:05.028
I promise that
I will do everything I can

17:05.156 --> 17:06.329
to save Michelle.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.632
(sighs)

17:10.563 --> 17:13.169

-(phone beeps)

17:16.335 --> 17:18.212
(horn honks in distance)

17:22.708 --> 17:25.051
(ticking)

17:25.176 --> 17:28.181
You see, the engineering

17:28.314 --> 17:31.693
in this area alone
took us up 20%.

17:39.258 --> 17:42.671
MARY: Is it wrong to pray
for a new heart?

17:44.830 --> 17:47.333
JOHN:
Why would that be wrong?

17:47.433 --> 17:49.674
She's fighting for her life.

17:49.769 --> 17:53.046
Think about what asking
for a donor heart means.

17:53.172 --> 17:56.210
It means that someone else's
child has to die

17:56.342 --> 17:59.448
just so that ours can live.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.955
She needs a heart.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.120
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna worry

18:06.252 --> 18:08.459
about where it comes from.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.462
<i>LISA:
So, what's the overall cost</i>

18:11.591 --> 18:14.435
of site prep going to be?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.704
Um, let me see.
That's a great question.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.402
Seriously, Pastor,

18:20.533 --> 18:23.480
I know that I popped in
on really short notice,

18:23.603 --> 18:25.480
so if you have another meeting

18:25.605 --> 18:27.448
or somewhere else
you need to be,

18:27.573 --> 18:29.450
I totally understand.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.151
It's my son.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.955
I promised to take him to his
big basketball game today.

18:38.084 --> 18:41.065
It's a promise I've broken
way too often.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.928
I know... to most people,

18:46.058 --> 18:47.799
a kid's basketball game

18:47.927 --> 18:52.239
is not <i>as</i> important as a huge
construction project, but...

18:52.331 --> 18:55.244
to a father, it should be.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.281
(singing with Latin pop song)

19:08.347 --> 19:11.089
I'm coming, I'm coming.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.095
(phone beeps)

19:20.192 --> 19:22.194
DAVID: Come on, Eric,
answer the phone.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.205
Come on, pick up the phone.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.319
Good morning.

21:20.412 --> 21:21.914
Mr. and Mrs. Newman,

21:22.047 --> 21:22.923
my name is Dr. Burgess.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.652
I'm chief of neurology.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.491
I've been monitoring
Eric's condition

21:26.619 --> 21:28.326
throughout the evening.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.060
And... what Eric has suffered

21:31.157 --> 21:34.434
is a traumatic brain injury
called cerebral edema.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.270
Although his heart
is beating very strong,

21:39.398 --> 21:41.503
he's had a total absence
of brain function

21:41.634 --> 21:44.308
for the past 12 hours.

21:44.436 --> 21:49.909
Now, I have studied his MRls
and his CAT scans, and...

21:51.177 --> 21:54.454
...there's no easy way
to say this,

21:54.580 --> 21:58.027
but Eric's head injury
is irreversible.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.826
What are you saying?

22:01.954 --> 22:06.334
Ma'am, what I'm saying is...

22:06.458 --> 22:08.665
Eric's head injury is so severe

22:08.794 --> 22:11.104
it is very unlikely
he's going to recover.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.302
No. Don't say that.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.503
Don't say that.
That's not true.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.443
It can't be true, Doctor.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.948
Mr. Newman, I'm sorry.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.952
I wish
I had better news for you.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.886
I truly do.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.626

24:17.423 --> 24:19.630
-(exhales)
- I do.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.635
If there's anything
that we can do to help you

24:21.760 --> 24:23.467
during this time,
please don't hesitate.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.905
- Anything at all, Mrs. Newman.
- Thank you. Um...

24:25.998 --> 24:27.409
What is this?

24:27.499 --> 24:29.410
This is my husband, David.

24:29.501 --> 24:33.643
Baby, this is Mr. Mayberry from
the local organ donor center.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.582
I'm very sorry about your
son's accident, Mr. Newman.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.018
It was no accident.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.646
He was struck down
by some careless teenager

24:40.779 --> 24:44.283
-more concerned with her
texting... -Okay, baby, okay.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.953
So...

24:47.086 --> 24:50.659
are you suggesting
that I donate my son's organs?

24:50.789 --> 24:52.996
Mr. Newman, I understand
how hard this must be...

24:53.125 --> 24:56.663
You can't possibly understand
how hard this is, Mr. Mayberry.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.935
Mr. Newman, please,
it's been more than a week,

25:00.032 --> 25:02.512
and there has been absolutely
no change in Erids condition.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.274
Now, I'm afraid, at this stage,

25:05.371 --> 25:07.351
the law gives the hospital the
right to declare him deceased.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.784
- My son's not dead. He's
not dead. -Just listen, okay?

25:10.876 --> 25:14.289
We'll j... we'll just listen
to what he has to say.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.155
Is this what you want,

25:16.281 --> 25:18.625
to rip him open,
take away his organs?

25:18.717 --> 25:20.390
Don't let them do it, Dad.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.294
He's still alive. I know it.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.229
Mom, please.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.836
No one is touching him.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.075
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Newman.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.514
Mrs. Newman.

25:42.808 --> 25:47.518
I held off the hospital's
decision as long <i>as</i> I could.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.592
I'm sorry.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.859
How could you possibly think
that I was gonna allow him

25:55.988 --> 25:57.160
to take my son's organs?

25:57.256 --> 25:59.099
Our son-.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.169
That's our baby in there.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.103
I wanted him to be okay.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.578
I wanted

26:11.703 --> 26:13.512
to hear him say my name

26:13.605 --> 26:16.677
and-and smile his big smile.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.222
It's not...

26:22.347 --> 26:24.850
it's not God's plan.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.452
"God's plan," Mom?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.360
(shuddering exhale)

26:28.454 --> 26:30.934
Junior's right.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.763
This can't be God's plan.

26:32.891 --> 26:34.962
- He's only 12 year...
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, hey.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.574
We, of all people,

26:37.696 --> 26:42.111
know we can't question
His work.

26:43.735 --> 26:47.706
You, of all people, know that.

26:50.943 --> 26:55.824
Somebody somewhere
needs Eric's...

26:55.948 --> 26:57.928
help.

27:00.486 --> 27:03.831
We have to let him go...

27:05.724 --> 27:09.501
...so that God can do His will.

27:12.931 --> 27:14.911
No.

27:17.769 --> 27:20.113
No.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.617
(shuddering breaths)

27:26.612 --> 27:28.592
(sniffles)

27:29.948 --> 27:32.326
(ventilator pumping steadily)

27:40.959 --> 27:45.931
Young lady, have you any idea
the pain you've caused?

27:46.031 --> 27:47.874
I'm sorry.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.139
Your inability
to put your phone away

27:50.269 --> 27:52.374
for a brief amount of time
has caused

27:52.504 --> 27:54.211
much pain and suffering.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.809
And as much as I would like
to sentence you right now,

27:57.943 --> 28:00.480
this very minute, I cannot.

28:00.612 --> 28:01.852
(shuddering breath)

28:01.980 --> 28:06.122
The best way to end
texting and driving

28:06.218 --> 28:08.664
is to educate everyone--

28:08.787 --> 28:10.960
especially our teenagers--

28:11.056 --> 28:12.967
of its dangers.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.969
I'm so sorry.

28:15.060 --> 28:18.064
Please, I just want to go home.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.700
There's a 12-year-old boy
in the hospital

28:20.832 --> 28:23.039
fighting for his life.

28:23.168 --> 28:25.341
- You will not be going home
today... -(sobs)

28:25.470 --> 28:28.007
-...or anytime soon.
-(¢Win9)

28:28.140 --> 28:29.517
I'm remanding you
to the custody

28:29.641 --> 28:31.848
of the juvenile
detention center.

28:31.977 --> 28:33.388
You will await trial there.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.387
(gasps)

28:35.514 --> 28:38.154
(coughs)
Mommy.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.888
(sobbing):
Mommy.

28:40.018 --> 28:41.895
Mommy, I don't want to go.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.261
- It's okay. It's okay.
- No. Mom...

28:44.389 --> 28:46.892
(crying)

28:47.025 --> 28:48.902
- It's okay. It's okay.
- No.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.234
Please, Mother.

28:51.363 --> 28:54.105
-(¢Win9)
-(shuddering exhale)

29:12.117 --> 29:14.757
(shuddering sigh)

29:14.886 --> 29:18.356
Theresa told me what happened.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.198
They're trying to take him
from me, Ma.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.275
No, son,

29:25.397 --> 29:28.435
they want him
to help save lives.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.984
So you think it's okay, too?

29:37.109 --> 29:38.816
Just let him die.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.083
No, that's not what I said.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.658
Yes, Mom.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.091
That's exactly what you
and Theresa are saying.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.994
Theresa should've never let
that organ donor coordinator

29:49.121 --> 29:50.429
come into his room.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.796
Theresa did the right thing,
David,

29:52.924 --> 29:54.460
and I think you know that.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.095
The right thing for who?

29:56.228 --> 29:58.504
Some strangers we've never met?

29:58.630 --> 30:01.304
Someone who deserves to live
more than my son?

30:01.433 --> 30:04.676
You know, where's Dad?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.181
He never believed in this
organ donation stuff anyway.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.912
That's not true, son.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.955
Sure, at times, your father
has discussed openly

30:13.078 --> 30:14.785
the practice

30:14.913 --> 30:19.191
and even challenged
its principles spiritually,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.798
but he will be the first
to tell you

30:21.920 --> 30:24.196
there are times in the Bible

30:24.323 --> 30:28.203
where the Lord tells us
the importance

30:28.327 --> 30:30.273
of preserving life.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.809
Why aren't we fighting
to preserve Eric's life?

30:33.932 --> 30:36.811
You know the answer
to that question, David.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.513
But, unfortunately,
its the answer

30:40.639 --> 30:42.983
none of us wants to hear.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.215
I love you, son,

30:48.347 --> 30:53.558
and I love Eric so much.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.566
Please don't let his life
end this way.

31:00.826 --> 31:04.171
Let his life have a purpose...

31:05.230 --> 31:08.404
---even---

31:08.533 --> 31:12.208
even in death.

Amen.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.426
(crying)

32:34.553 --> 32:39.002
DAVID: Son, I remember the
first time I held your hand.

32:40.559 --> 32:44.837
And I kept asking you
to squeeze my finger.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.578
"Squeeze Daddy's finger."

32:49.668 --> 32:52.308
And you did.
You squeezed it so hard.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.747
Out of nowhere.

32:59.611 --> 33:03.582
Squeeze Daddy's finger, son.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.165
Oh, God, please,

33:09.287 --> 33:12.666
just let him squeeze my finger.

33:16.461 --> 33:19.169
Lord,

33:19.297 --> 33:24.303
I have thanked You every day
since You gave Eric to us.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.312
(sniffles)

33:25.437 --> 33:27.815
(sighs)

33:29.975 --> 33:33.787
But ifs so hard to forgive You
for taking him away.

33:40.785 --> 33:43.163
I'm so sorry.

Thank you.
How can I help you, Detective?

we now have evidence

Maria Hernandez
with vehicular manslaughter.

Maria Hernandez?

while texting and driving.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.168
I'm sorry, sir,
but the subject is a minor,

41:35.293 --> 41:38.172
so at this point in time
all I can give you is a name.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.503
But the D.A. should
be contacting you soon.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.174
Can you at least
tell me her age?

41:44.302 --> 41:46.111
The subject was...

41:46.204 --> 41:49.208
17 years old at the time
of the incident.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.219
17. So young.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.323
Okay, I'm-I'm...

41:54.445 --> 41:56.550
I'm sorry, wha... what is she
being charged with?

41:56.681 --> 41:58.558
I thought it was
a traffic accident.

41:58.683 --> 42:02.187
The tragic death of your son
was a traffic accident.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.130
But, in this state, if we can
show criminal negligence,

42:05.223 --> 42:09.137
i.e. texting while operating
a motor vehicle, well,

42:09.227 --> 42:12.401
the charges of manslaughter
can be attached.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.703
So she could go to prison.

42:14.832 --> 42:16.709
Well, if the D.A.

42:16.834 --> 42:18.711
elects to charge her
as an adult...

42:18.836 --> 42:20.645
well, she'd be
a very old woman

42:20.738 --> 42:22.240
before she gets out.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.909
Oh.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.921
I guess I never thought
it could be so severe.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.922
Mr. Newman,

42:29.047 --> 42:31.391
you should be getting a call
from the D.A.'s office soon.

42:31.516 --> 42:34.395
And they can better
update you on your case.

42:34.519 --> 42:37.500
I thank you
for your time, sir.

42:37.588 --> 42:40.569
And, again...
my condolences.

42:40.691 --> 42:42.671
Thank you, Detective.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.171
FARNSWORTH: The programs
for the installation service

42:51.269 --> 42:54.011
go to the printers tomorrow.
David, if you would please,

42:54.105 --> 42:56.381
uh, make your
final changes tonight

42:56.507 --> 42:58.680
and give 'em to Brother Cecil
in the morning.

43:01.212 --> 43:02.520
David?

43:03.781 --> 43:05.283
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.690
CECIL:
All right, well...

43:06.784 --> 43:08.195
that leaves on the agenda

43:08.286 --> 43:09.856
the new construction project.

43:09.954 --> 43:12.434
Well, the new
construction'll be David's

43:12.557 --> 43:14.230
first major project
as leader of this church.

43:14.358 --> 43:15.860
So I tell you what--

43:15.960 --> 43:18.600
we're gonna let him
make all future decisions.

43:18.729 --> 43:20.709
- All right, well...
- All right, y'all.

43:20.798 --> 43:22.106
David, we better to start
looking for new contractors,

43:22.233 --> 43:24.213
like, yesterday.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.282
One second, Cecil.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.284
Hey, Dad.

43:32.410 --> 43:34.321
What was that about?

43:34.445 --> 43:35.617
What do you mean?

43:35.746 --> 43:37.817
The new construction
was your idea.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.485
Now you're just gonna
walk away and leave it to me?

43:39.617 --> 43:42.120
Oh, son, you're taking over
this church in a month,

43:42.253 --> 43:43.926
and I have no doubt
in my mind

43:44.055 --> 43:46.831
that the new life center
will grow and flourish

43:46.958 --> 43:48.767
under your lead.
Besides,

43:48.893 --> 43:51.772
you've pretty much
been the lead on it anyhow.

43:51.896 --> 43:53.773
What...
You're just leaving?

43:53.898 --> 43:57.243
What about everything
that's happened?

43:57.335 --> 43:59.975
Proverbs 3:5 and 6--

44:00.104 --> 44:01.674
"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

44:01.806 --> 44:04.446
"and lean not on your own
understanding.

44:04.575 --> 44:06.452
"In all your ways
acknowledge Him,

44:06.577 --> 44:08.284
and He will
set your paths straight."

44:08.412 --> 44:10.915
Proverbs.

44:11.015 --> 44:13.825
That's it? You're not
gonna answer the question?

44:16.254 --> 44:18.131
What happened to your son,
my grandson,

44:18.256 --> 44:20.497
was a tragic
and horrible thing,

44:20.625 --> 44:24.095
but the Lord's work
is still yet to be done.

44:24.195 --> 44:25.868
And no, son,
I'm not leaving you.

44:25.997 --> 44:28.876
I'm just going home.

44:42.113 --> 44:45.720
Lord, I know what Maria did
is a sin in Your eyes.

44:45.850 --> 44:48.296
But in her heart,

44:48.386 --> 44:50.127
in her soul,

44:50.221 --> 44:53.168
she is good.

44:53.291 --> 44:56.636
Lord, I ask that
You send us a blessing.

44:56.727 --> 44:59.537
Someone, anyone...

44:59.664 --> 45:01.473
to show the authorities

45:01.566 --> 45:04.046
all the good
that is in her.

45:06.971 --> 45:08.848
(hammering in distance)

45:08.973 --> 45:10.577
ED:
I'm sorry, John.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.381
I just don't have room
or the work

45:12.510 --> 45:14.581
to bring on your team
right now.

45:14.712 --> 45:18.182
I've always been there
for you, Ed.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.860
I wish there was
something I could do.

45:21.986 --> 45:24.091
My father started
Danielson Construction

45:24.222 --> 45:25.826
40 years ago.

45:25.923 --> 45:27.368
We invested
every penny he made

45:27.491 --> 45:29.027
back into the company.

45:29.160 --> 45:32.198
Hired quality workers.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.037
But today all these guys
have to do is rely on

45:34.165 --> 45:35.508
some government regulation.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.409
- That's not true, John.
- No, that is true.

45:37.535 --> 45:38.605
How many of your men

45:38.736 --> 45:40.443
actually earned a spot
on your team?

45:41.839 --> 45:43.216
How many
belong in this country?

45:43.341 --> 45:46.220
Every last one of them!

45:46.344 --> 45:48.722
You want to know why no one
returns your calls, John?

45:50.214 --> 45:51.284
It's you.

45:51.415 --> 45:54.055
You're always angry
about something.

45:54.185 --> 45:57.462
And you always blame others
for your problems.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.592
You have a lot
to be thankful for, son.

46:00.725 --> 46:03.365
I've got a lot
to be thankful for?

46:03.461 --> 46:06.533
I'm filing for bankruptcy
in four weeks.

46:06.631 --> 46:10.443
Your daughter
just received a new heart.

46:10.568 --> 46:13.139
Do you not see that as nothing
less than a blessing from God

46:13.271 --> 46:15.148
and a reason for prayer?

46:15.273 --> 46:17.719
Are you actually gonna
stand there and tell me

46:17.808 --> 46:19.287
that the reason
your business is flourishing

46:19.410 --> 46:20.946
is because you pray?

46:21.078 --> 46:23.558
That's exactly what
I'm standing here doing.

46:23.648 --> 46:27.118
God tells us if we ask,
it will be given to us.

46:27.251 --> 46:28.992
I pray for God's blessings

46:29.120 --> 46:31.896
and mercy every day, son.

46:37.428 --> 46:39.931
I'm giving you the name
of a very good friend.

46:40.064 --> 46:42.237
He's adding a major addition
to his church.

46:42.333 --> 46:44.244
It's a really big project.

46:44.335 --> 46:48.147
I'm stretched thin right now--
I'm not bidding the job.

46:48.272 --> 46:50.149
That's all I can do for you.

46:53.010 --> 46:54.990
Thanks.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.827
John.

46:58.949 --> 47:00.951
Give him a call.

47:01.085 --> 47:04.623
And when you go interview...

47:04.755 --> 47:07.201
leave your anger
in the truck.

47:15.266 --> 47:17.439
Children's center right there.

47:17.535 --> 47:19.481
Yeah, that-that's a good spot
for that playground wing

47:19.603 --> 47:21.480
-you were talking about.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

47:21.605 --> 47:23.551
- I think this is...
- Oh. Okay.

47:30.881 --> 47:33.384
CECIL:
Hey, Mr. Danielson, right?

47:33.517 --> 47:34.962
I'm Cecil King.

47:35.052 --> 47:36.531
Wasn't really expecting
a building this nice

47:36.654 --> 47:38.497
in this area.

47:38.622 --> 47:41.159
Well, God's been good.
He's been good.

47:41.292 --> 47:43.670
So, let me... let me
introduce you to Pastor.

47:43.794 --> 47:45.501
We're just back here
going over some things.

47:45.629 --> 47:47.506
He'll be able
to make it clear to you--

47:47.631 --> 47:50.703
you know, what his vision is
and direction he's headed.

47:50.835 --> 47:53.714
Mr. Danielson, Pastor Newman.
Thanks for coming out.

47:53.838 --> 47:56.546
Doesn't really look like you
need any work done around here.

47:56.674 --> 47:59.177
What is it you're looking
to get done'?

47:59.310 --> 48:03.019
Okay. A man who likes
to dive right in.

48:03.147 --> 48:05.058
Well, our plans
are to build out

48:05.182 --> 48:07.093
this whole staked-off
area here.

48:07.218 --> 48:09.323
And maybe add
an addition right here

48:09.420 --> 48:11.331
for our children's center.

48:11.422 --> 48:12.924
That's a pretty big job.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.537
- Yeah.
- Gonna be expensive.

48:15.659 --> 48:18.105
I would have to see proof of
funds before we get started,

48:18.229 --> 48:21.438
because, honestly...
I can't waste my time.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.238
We would n”:
call you out here

48:23.367 --> 48:25.506
to waste your time,
Mr. Danielson.

48:25.603 --> 48:29.380
But only if we offer you
the job will we show you

48:29.507 --> 48:32.954
any documentation
or proof of funds.

48:33.077 --> 48:34.454
CECIL:
Which, at that point,

48:34.578 --> 48:36.057
you'll be dealing with me.

48:36.180 --> 48:38.126
And I can assure you
we got everything we need.

48:42.353 --> 48:44.629
I'm probably
not the man for this.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.894
What do you mean?
Wait a minute.

48:47.024 --> 48:48.401
- Let me...
- Cecil, Cecil.

48:48.526 --> 48:50.938
Pastor, he's the last one
on the list.

48:51.061 --> 48:54.201
- Let him go.
-(truck engine starts)

48:54.298 --> 48:56.209
DAVID: <i>What do you mean
he's not here?</i>

48:56.300 --> 49:00.077
He left a note saying that
he was going for a bike ride.

49:02.540 --> 49:04.417
He knows he can't
just leave the house

49:04.542 --> 49:06.146
without letting us know.
And what about church?

49:06.277 --> 49:08.587
He knew we were
going to church today.

49:08.712 --> 49:10.988
He needs time.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.095
He needs space.

49:15.286 --> 49:17.391
<i>N'</i>

49:17.488 --> 49:19.092
FARNSWORTH:
And how do <i>I</i> know

49:19.223 --> 49:20.998
<i>there's a place in heaven?</i>

49:21.125 --> 49:22.729
Because scripture tells us

49:22.827 --> 49:26.604
that in our "Father's house
there are many rooms.

49:26.730 --> 49:29.233
"If it were not so,
would I have told you

49:29.333 --> 49:31.939
"that I am going
to prepare a place for you?

49:32.069 --> 49:34.174
"And if I go and prepare
a place for you,

49:34.305 --> 49:38.014
"I will come back and welcome
you into My presence,

49:38.142 --> 49:41.521
so you also
may be where I am."

49:41.645 --> 49:43.625
<i>N'</i>

49:59.296 --> 50:01.276
<i>N'</i>

50:13.711 --> 50:15.691
<i>N'</i>

50:24.655 --> 50:26.828
Junior.

50:26.957 --> 50:28.903
Junior, you're home?

50:33.631 --> 50:35.838
Listen, son, we understand
that you need space.

50:35.966 --> 50:39.573
But you need to let us know
before you leave this house.

50:39.703 --> 50:42.081
Especially today-- you knew
we were going to church.

50:42.206 --> 50:43.082
THERESA:
We got your note, baby,

50:43.207 --> 50:44.481
but, I mean, come on, you still

50:44.575 --> 50:45.986
need permission before
you just leave the house.

50:46.076 --> 50:47.987
You don't leave us a note.

50:48.078 --> 50:49.421
Why do you care?

50:50.548 --> 50:51.583
Whafd you say?

50:51.715 --> 50:52.921
Do you even miss him, Dad?

50:53.050 --> 50:54.586
Have you even visited him?

50:54.718 --> 50:56.356
Don't you want to tell Eric
you're sorry for not

50:56.487 --> 50:57.557
being there that day
to pick him up

50:57.688 --> 50:58.598
-like you promised?
- Hey, hey!

50:58.722 --> 51:00.030
That is enough.

51:00.157 --> 51:02.103
Get in your room.

51:08.265 --> 51:09.744
I do miss him.

51:14.838 --> 51:17.011
I know you do.

51:27.685 --> 51:29.687
Hi. Uh, may I speak

51:29.787 --> 51:32.961
with your
school counselor, please?

51:33.090 --> 51:35.070
(indistinct conversations)

51:46.804 --> 51:48.784
<i>N'</i>

52:00.417 --> 52:02.419
H 9Y-

52:02.553 --> 52:04.430
What is this?

52:04.555 --> 52:07.434
Juniofs school counselor
has arranged for me

52:07.558 --> 52:11.267
to speak to some
students tomorrow about...

52:11.395 --> 52:12.499
texting while driving,

52:12.630 --> 52:13.973
and being an organ donor.

52:14.098 --> 52:16.078
No, no,
you're not doing that.

52:17.468 --> 52:21.143
Uh, with all due respect...

52:21.271 --> 52:23.148
what?

52:23.273 --> 52:24.911
I mean, I'm sorry,
but that's-that's not fair.

52:25.009 --> 52:26.647
Fain'!

52:26.777 --> 52:29.485
Is it fair a teenager texting
on her phone killed Eric?

52:29.613 --> 52:31.286
Is that fair?
Is it fair

52:31.415 --> 52:33.622
that we live our entire life
the way God asks,

52:33.751 --> 52:36.664
and somehow
He still finds it fit

52:36.787 --> 52:39.131
to take Eric from us?
Is that fair?

52:39.256 --> 52:41.167
- Is that fair, Theresa?
- I don't-l don't know.

52:41.291 --> 52:44.170
So you tell me
how is running down there

52:44.294 --> 52:46.296
and telling these kids
about Eric's death

52:46.430 --> 52:48.774
and how, somehow, it's part
of God's plan-- what are they

52:48.866 --> 52:50.539
-supposed to learn from that?
- I'm not gonna tell them...

52:50.668 --> 52:52.113
What are they supposed

52:52.202 --> 52:54.341
-to learn from that'?
- I don't know, David!

52:58.542 --> 53:00.146
I don't know if they're gonna
learn anything

53:00.277 --> 53:04.054
from what I have to say
tomorrow. I don't know.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.724
I know this:

53:08.852 --> 53:11.492
I'm going down there tomorrow.

53:11.622 --> 53:15.001
And if I reach one student,

53:15.125 --> 53:17.036
then maybe

53:17.161 --> 53:19.402
they will reach
another one.

53:19.530 --> 53:21.476
And then, from there,
another one.

53:22.866 --> 53:26.040
I know that my son's death

53:26.170 --> 53:27.740
has to have a purpose.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.204
(crying)

53:59.770 --> 54:01.750
<i>N'</i>

54:07.077 --> 54:09.182
THERESA:
<i>11</i> teens

54:09.279 --> 54:11.623
die every day

54:11.749 --> 54:15.595
as a result of texting
while driving.

54:15.719 --> 54:18.893
And 21% of teen drivers

54:19.022 --> 54:20.626
involved in fatal accidents

54:20.758 --> 54:23.796
were distracted
by their cell phones.

54:23.927 --> 54:27.465
Last month...

54:27.598 --> 54:30.477
my son was killed.

54:30.601 --> 54:34.276
He was hit by a car,
and the driver...

54:34.404 --> 54:37.544
was texting and driving.
A teenager.

54:37.641 --> 54:41.145
I need for you to promise

54:41.278 --> 54:44.316
that you will never
text and drive.

54:45.816 --> 54:47.659
I'm asking you to wait
until it's safe

54:47.785 --> 54:49.560
to use your cell phones.

54:49.653 --> 54:53.430
I'm pleading with you
to take...

54:53.557 --> 54:56.299
this pledge.

54:56.426 --> 54:59.270
The "no texting
while driving" pledge.

54:59.396 --> 55:01.467
You can challenge
your friends on social media

55:01.598 --> 55:03.669
to do it.

55:03.801 --> 55:05.781
And...

55:08.906 --> 55:10.852
...think about this-- about

55:10.974 --> 55:13.284
being an organ donor.

55:13.410 --> 55:15.253
Each one of you
in this very room

55:15.345 --> 55:18.417
can save up to eight people.

55:19.850 --> 55:21.989
So...

55:22.119 --> 55:24.258
if you are interested

55:24.354 --> 55:25.856
in any of that,
if you are interested

55:25.989 --> 55:27.195
in signing up.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.133
Would you raise your hands?

55:36.767 --> 55:38.713
Thank you.

55:41.872 --> 55:43.852
Looks like we're off
to a great start.

55:48.378 --> 55:49.789
<i>CECE“;
David, we have</i>

55:49.880 --> 55:51.359
got to find
a new contractor.

55:53.283 --> 55:56.059
Man, the first interest payment
on this loan is due soon

55:56.186 --> 55:59.065
and we have not even
driven the first nail yet.

55:59.189 --> 56:00.668
I know.

56:00.791 --> 56:02.134
I don't know
what to do, Cecil.

56:02.226 --> 56:04.706
I mean,
every contractor's booked.

56:04.828 --> 56:06.808
Well, not every one.

56:08.899 --> 56:10.810
No. I am not

56:10.901 --> 56:12.847
-dealing with that guy again.
- Okay.

56:12.970 --> 56:15.416
Look, I get it, all right?

56:15.539 --> 56:17.746
The man...

56:17.875 --> 56:19.752
obviously has some issues.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.720
- That's a good way to put it.
- Yeah.

56:21.845 --> 56:24.416
Well, I talked
to Ed Reynolds yesterday.

56:24.548 --> 56:27.256
And he said
Mr. Danielson's absolutely

56:27.384 --> 56:30.058
the best contractor
on the list.

56:30.187 --> 56:33.259
- Cecil, so?
- Wait, there-there's more.

56:33.390 --> 56:35.529
See...

56:35.659 --> 56:37.536
Mr. Danielson,
on the surface--

56:37.661 --> 56:40.039
and probably a little bit
underneath, too--

56:40.163 --> 56:41.540
seems like a really bad guy.

56:41.665 --> 56:43.042
Probably is.

56:43.166 --> 56:44.509
I don't know.

56:44.601 --> 56:45.739
But, you know,
in talking to Ed,

56:45.869 --> 56:47.041
I find out that the guy...

56:47.170 --> 56:48.444
his business

56:48.572 --> 56:51.883
is struggling,
for one thing, and then,

56:52.009 --> 56:53.283
on top of that,
the man is dealing with

56:53.410 --> 56:55.083
some serious family issues.

56:55.212 --> 56:57.556
He's got a lot going on.

56:57.681 --> 56:59.718
I mean, shouldn't we
work with a contractor

56:59.850 --> 57:02.456
that wants to work with us?

57:02.586 --> 57:05.032
Maybe that'd make
you feel more comfortable.

57:05.122 --> 57:07.864
But that's not who we are.

57:07.958 --> 57:10.370
David, we're men of God.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.440
That means we made
a commitment to choose a path

57:12.562 --> 57:14.064
He chose for us...

57:14.197 --> 57:16.905
not the one
we want to choose.

57:17.034 --> 57:19.640
David, we go where
He tells us to go.

57:19.770 --> 57:21.875
We do what He tells us to do.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.883
Even if it makes us
uncomfortable.

57:27.978 --> 57:29.958
You know, I'm not
even worried about it.

57:31.982 --> 57:34.622
I know
you'll do the right thing.

57:34.751 --> 57:36.424
What's this?

57:36.553 --> 57:39.397
That would be the address
to Danielson Construction.

57:39.489 --> 57:41.400
- Cecil...
- God is good, Pastor.

57:41.491 --> 57:43.129
Get to that meeting.

57:43.260 --> 57:45.240
(Cecil chuckles)

57:58.742 --> 58:00.346
Hello, Mr. Danielson.

58:02.012 --> 58:04.822
Do you have a second?

58:08.085 --> 58:09.621
Have a seat.

58:09.753 --> 58:11.994
Thank you.

58:12.122 --> 58:13.999
I thought
I was pretty clear

58:14.124 --> 58:15.797
that I wasn't interested
in your job the other day.

58:15.926 --> 58:18.998
No, you said the job
was probably not for you.

58:19.129 --> 58:22.440
"Probably" still gives us
a chance to work things out.

58:22.532 --> 58:25.274
Well, I'm not sure
what we have to work out.

58:25.369 --> 58:27.474
To be honest,
I'm pretty busy around here.

58:27.604 --> 58:29.345
Really?

58:29.473 --> 58:32.716
I spoke to Ed Reynolds
on the way over here.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.483
He had nothing
but high praises for you.

58:35.612 --> 58:37.455
In fact, he said
you're the only one

58:37.547 --> 58:40.721
that can get the job done
on time and on budget.

58:42.119 --> 58:45.293
So I'm here... hoping that

58:45.389 --> 58:48.529
you're willing to forget
about the other day,

58:48.658 --> 58:52.196
and willing to start over.

58:52.329 --> 58:54.331
'Cause I think there's a lot
we can work out

58:54.464 --> 58:58.173
that'd be beneficial
to you and to me.

59:00.037 --> 59:01.914
Okay.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.019
Mr. Danielson,

59:04.141 --> 59:06.917
lam Pastor Newman,
and I need a contractor.

59:16.486 --> 59:19.160
John Danielson.
lfd be a pleasure

59:19.256 --> 59:20.894
to speak to you
about your job, sir.

59:21.024 --> 59:23.163
Fantastic.

59:25.862 --> 59:27.773
- She's doing the best she can.
- I was just hoping

59:27.898 --> 59:30.003
-she'd be singing by now.
- But she's tired.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.773
These things, they take time.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.848
Listen, the doctor even says
she should be further along.

59:33.937 --> 59:35.848
- I'm not even sure
she's trying. -Trying?

59:35.939 --> 59:38.078
John, she had
a heart transplant.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.949
I mean, when are you ever
gonna show compassion

59:40.077 --> 59:42.421
and concern for anyone?
Especially your daughter.

59:42.546 --> 59:45.425
Look, I just want
to hear my baby sing, okay?

59:45.549 --> 59:47.426
Only God and Michelle

59:47.551 --> 59:49.428
are gonna know
when she can sing again,

59:49.553 --> 59:51.430
and I don't believe
that she can't...

59:51.555 --> 59:54.536
Oh, no.
Honey, I'm so sorry.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.236
Yeah.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.745
Yeah, I got it.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.816
Yeah, okay.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.485
You Okay?

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.492
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be fine.

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:22.897
Okay.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:26.092
Um... I invited
your mom and dad over

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:27.463
for a late dinner tonight.

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:29.468
Uh...

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.472
I just thought that we could
all use some time together.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:34.337
Of course.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.171
Um, it's just that...

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.404
Cecil just called.

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:41.244
Remember that third-party
manager I had talked about?

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:44.410
Oh, the one they dropped
on you at the last minute?

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:46.419
Yeah.

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:49.650
Uh, she called and invited
Cecil and I to dinner

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:53.124
to discuss,
hopefully, the approval

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.196
of the building plans
by the city.

01:00:58.088 --> 01:01:00.364
You want to go, right?

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.798
Well... yeah, I have to.

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.202
Ever since the accident,

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:07.672
I've been blowing her off,

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.174
putting her on Cecil.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.345
I will call Morn and Dad

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.450
and I'll reschedule.

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:19.648
No. No, no.

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.278
Um...

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:24.291
Yeah, you said
a late dinner, right?

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:25.985
- Mm-hmm.
-0kay, I'll just

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:28.118
g0 to the restaurant,
have appetizers.

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.198
I'll be back
in time for dinner.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:32.961
Okay.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.364
Okay? All right.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:38.299
- Gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:46.045
(Michelle panting)

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.678
(groans softly)

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:52.548
{groans}

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.019
Honey, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:55.919
Let me get that for you.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.855
- Here you go.
- Oh.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.928
Thanks, Mom.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.725
You know, honey, I am so sorry
that you heard that discussion.

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.594
(Michelle laughs,
Mary sighs)

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.566
Is that what married people
call a discussion nowadays?

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:11.901
Your father--
he-he really does love you.

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:14.770
He just doesn't know how
to express it sometimes, and...

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:18.344
I know. I just...

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:21.905
Mom, I just don't think
I can ever sing again.

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:25.417
I mean, I can barely get
from my bedroom to the couch

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.715
without passing out
on the floor.

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:33.516
Honestly, I don't think
I ever want to sing again.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.959
Don't you say that.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.397
Don't you ever say that.

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:43.698
God-- He gave you
the most amazing gift,

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:47.297
and He gave you that gift
for a reason.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.639
And one day, He is going
to reveal what that reason is,

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:53.543
and somebody is going
to be so blessed by you.

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:55.981
I promise.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:00.779
Well, maybe that blessing
will be for you, Mom.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.481
Honey...

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.217
you've been my blessing

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.727
since the very second
that you arrived.

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.558
(horn honks)

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:15.603
CECIL: <i>Oh, I'm glad
you could make it.</i>

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:16.999
LISA:
Oh, and I invited you.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.435
-(laughing): Yeah, well...
-(Lisa laughs)

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:19.801
Well, I'm here, I'm ready.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.237
And I'm glad
you could make it.

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.072
Can I start you guys off
with something to drink?

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.770
Uh, let's see.

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:27.404
- I'll just have an iced tea.
- Uh, you know what?

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.007
That sounds good. Make that
two. One that's sweet, please.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.848
- And we're waiting on one more.
- No, you're not.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.421
Make that three iced teas,
please.

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:36.115
- Absolutely. Coming right up.
- Hello.

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:37.589
- Hello, Pastor.
- Hello.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:38.989
- Hello.
- Hi. Good to see you.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.458
Good seeing you.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.028
I see Cecil brought his whole
project file with him.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.358
I ain't got no choice.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.022
- I can't put the thing down.
-(chuckles)

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.657
I mean, this has gotten
to the point this has become

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.531
-my bedtime reading
every night. -(Lisa laughs)

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.832
- No, it isn't. -I'm not
playing. My Bible's jealous.

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.963
Bible like,
"I mean, can you read me?

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:56.043
Can you pick me back up?
Can I be a part of your life?"

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.668
(laughter)

01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:00.145
- It's crazy. -Miss Pearl,
I do want to apologize.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.147
I know I've been out
of the loop lately,

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:04.616
-but, um, I just want
to say that... -Pastor,

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.279
Cecil has kept me up to speed
on everything that has

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:09.482
gone on with you and your
family these last few weeks.

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.785
<i>I am</i> very sorry for your loss.

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:14.555
You don't owe me an apology

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.027
or an explanation.

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:18.632
Thank you.
I appreciate you saying that.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:19.860
Of course.

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:23.034
Well, let's say we go ahead

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:25.161
and order the food,
and while they bring it,

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.639
-we can get into
this paperwork. -Sounds good.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.233
- Really?
- Oh, no, it doesn't.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:32.006
I invited the two of you
here tonight for dinner,

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.479
not to go over paperwork.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:37.848
Relax, gentlemen.

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.510
What I'm trying to say is,

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:42.316
I've seen all
that I need to see.

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:45.359
In the morning, I'll be making
a full recommendation

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:47.928
to the committee that
they approve the final plans

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.998
and move forward with
the two of you at the helm.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.725
- All right. Okay.
- Thank you so much.

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:54.858
Thank you. That's what
I thought she meant.

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.402
-(laughter)
- Thanks, Lisa.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.062
It's my pleasure, gentlemen.

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:02.404
I do recommend that you hire
a contractor ASAP.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:03.772
- Yes.
- I got a plan for that.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.243
Okay.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:10.680
I can't stay in this place
anymore, Mommy.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.083
(voice breaking):
This place is horrible.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:18.359
Baby, I know,

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:22.863
but, you know,
it's in God's hands now.

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:24.727
And He's gonna
get us through this.

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:27.198
(Maria sniffles)

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:30.965
(distant,
indistinct chatter)

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:34.405
Did you talk
to the D.A.'s office?

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.140
Yes.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.270
What did they say?

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:43.577
What did they say, Ma?

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:46.653
Is it that bad? Huh?

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.620
- What? -They said for us
to get the...

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:52.158
-best lawyer we can.
- No.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.626
I just don't know where
we're gonna find the money.

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:56.287
(Maria cries)

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:57.796
H 9Y-

01:05:57.921 --> 01:05:59.264
(CFYWQY
Mommy.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.062
Thank you for a wonderful time,
gentlemen.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:04.297
No. Thank you. Um, in fact,

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.340
hey, Cecil, why don't you
take Lisa to her car?

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.740
I have to hold back because
of the take-out box, but...

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:12.074
- Oh... I don't think...
- Yeah.

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.409
- No. Yeah, I don't... I don't
mind. I'll do it. -Um... -Yeah.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:15.744
No. I think... I think
she's fine with it, too.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:16.817
- Okay. -Are-are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.010
- Yeah. Okay.
- I got... I got it.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.142
It's not a problem at all.

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:20.185
We're gentlemen at my church.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.345
Okay. Sure. (laughs)

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:24.948
-(Lisa laughs)
- All right.

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.526
- It was a pleasure.
Thank you again. -All right.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.856
- Oh. Take care. Good night.
-(laughs) All right.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.430
- Oh, holding hands?
- LISA: Well, thanks.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.158
Already, huh? All right.

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:34.131
- CECIL: More than happy to.
-oh, I got you.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:37.769
- So how was everything?
- Fantastic.

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:40.137
In fact, do you deliver?
'Cause I have a group

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:42.004
of prayer warriors
at the church who would

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.474
tear this stuff up.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.273
I'm not sure
if we still do that.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.006
Our owner, Kate Hernandez--
she's not here right now,

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:48.308
and her daughter Maria
did the deliveries,

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:50.179
but she's not here anymore, so,

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:52.616
- I'm not sure if we still
do that. -I'm sorry. Maria?

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:54.484
Maria Hernandez?

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:57.182
Yeah. You know her?

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.884
You said
she's no longer with you.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.791
Where'd she go?

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.562
Sir, we're not really
supposed

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.192
-to disclose that information.
- Please.

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:13.235
Jail.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.741
She's in jail.

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:22.381
Are you okay, sir'?

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:27.488
Sir?

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.989
Are you okay?

01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:35.394
Do you know Maria?

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.398
Sir?

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:02.023
<i>N'</i>

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:10.057
<i>FARNSWORTH:
Lord, we thank You</i>

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:11.790
for the meal
we are about to receive.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.128
In Your name we pray. Amen.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:15.759
- Amen.
- Amen. -Amen.

01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:18.872
Ooh, Theresa, everything looks
and smells so good.

01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:20.532
Mm. Thanks, Mom.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.473
Mm-hmm. I think I'm just
gonna get myself two plates.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.442
That way I don't have to worry
about coming back for seconds.

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:25.773
(laughter)

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:28.814
THERESA:
Hey, baby.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.314
What's the matter?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.317
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.819
David, are you all right?

01:08:36.578 --> 01:08:39.082
I just went to the restaurant

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:42.059
owned by the mother
of the girl who killed Eric.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.265
What?

01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:47.560
You heard me.

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:49.966
Tonight I went
to the restaurant

01:08:50.093 --> 01:08:52.937
owned by Kate Hernandez,

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:54.631
the mother
of Maria Hernandez.

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:57.471
The same Maria Hernandez
who killed Eric.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.978
Wa-Was the mother
or daughter there?

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:01.946
Did you talk to them?

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.483
No. I don't know.
I got this from a waitress.

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.018
PATRICIA:
Look, look, look, David,

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.179
come sit down, son.
Let's talk about this.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.984
I don't know what
I would have done

01:09:10.113 --> 01:09:11.683
if either one of 'em
were there.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:15.261
You will do the only thing
a pastor and devoted servant

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:18.594
of the Lord would do.

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:21.259
Pray with them.

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.997
Pray for them.

01:09:24.127 --> 01:09:25.834
Pray with 'em?

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.603
Pray with the people who are

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.975
directly responsible
with the death of my son?

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:34.944
Your grandson, by the way.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.018
You want me to pray with...?

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.313
I'm-I'm sorry.
Pray for them, Mom?

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:41.388
Pray for 'em?

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.455
Yes... son.

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:48.188
'N.-

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:51.024
I can't imagine what
that mother and her daughter

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:53.725
are going through.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.837
And compassion is...

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.166
is something...

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:02.469
we can't just save
for our brothers and sisters.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:05.375
It has to be,
as the Lord has shown,

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.503
given to everyone
without exception.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:13.150
And that means
it must be given...

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:16.519
to the people who took
our precious Eric from us.

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:24.065
FARNSWORTH:
David'?

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:25.825
David,
your mother and I understand

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:27.868
what you and Theresa
and Junior are going through.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:31.733
It's never good
when a parent loses a child,

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:34.865
or a brother loses a brother,

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:38.570
-but we have to trust in
the Lord. -Trust in the Lord?

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.874
Trust in the Lord?

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:42.243
I swear, everybody needs

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.078
to stop saying
"Trust in the Lord."

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:46.084
Only thing me and Theresa been
doing is trusting in the Lord,

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:47.517
and look where it's gotten us.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:49.590
- David, come on now...
- No. Please!

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.589
You know something? You guys
can sit here and pretend

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:54.923
nothing has happened.
Don't expect me to do the same.

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:57.395
Enjoy your dinner.

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.938
(footsteps approaching)

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.750
(Farnsworth sighs)

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:22.152
Dad, I'm not in the mood
for a sermon.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.280
Well, neither am I,
but you're gonna listen

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.825
to what I have to say anyhow.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.986
David, you and your family

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.098
are going through something
I've always prayed

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.598
your mother and I would
never have to experience.

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:38.937
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:44.342
That Eric is gone.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.674
That every night
that I walk through that door,

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.680
he won't come running
in that room,

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.580
telling me all about his day

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:53.916
and his latest
basketball moves.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:56.513
I know. I know.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.456
But no amount of anger
is gonna bring him back.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.765
David, I'm going to, uh...

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:08.961
I'm going to suspend
the installation service.

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:16.133
Now? You're gonna take away
the church from me now?

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.506
You're still gonna
take over the church,

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:21.877
but right now, your anger
toward God shows all over you.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:25.383
In the pulpit,
here at home with your family.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.454
We're gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be fine.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:30.114
Yes, you will, but what happens

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:31.851
when a member loses someone

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:35.519
and they need God's word
to bring them comfort?

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:37.961
Who's gonna give I! to 'em?

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.398
You?

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.062
What about
the construction project?

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.231
You're still the lead.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.206
I'm still counting on you
to get it done.

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:55.079
I don't know what to do.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:58.185
I don't know how to move on,
I don't know if I can move.

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:00.344
You know exactly what to do.

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.854
Your mom and I
taught you that.

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:06.483
David, you've got to turn back
to your faith,

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:09.722
your trust
and your belief in the Lord.

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:11.331
You got to accept the fact

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.900
that God has a plan
forall of us.

01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:15.696
Young, old, doesn't matter.

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:18.431
My faith. My faith, Dad...

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.201
ls still in there!

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:24.010
I believe your love
for the Lord

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.545
is still right there
in your heart.

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:28.046
I believe that, son.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:31.843
The question is, do you?

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:33.852
Do you still believe
in your Lord and Savior?

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:36.048
Will you stop questioning
your faith

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:39.352
and ask Him for forgiveness?

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:43.021
Will you honor Eric
for all the souls he saved

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.861
from his sacrifice?

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.401
He's still out there.

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:52.802
His body parts, his heart
is beating strong in a...

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.136
Do you know how many times
I've prayed

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.744
just to hear his heart beat
one last time?

01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:04.073
Go to the Lord, son.

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.208
Open up to Him.

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:09.620
Listen to what
He has to say to you.

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.986
All of the answers
to our good fortunes

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:17.462
and our suffering are-are in
His spirit and in His power,

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:20.624
and can be found...

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:24.226
right there...

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:26.637
in His word.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:33.441
(sniffling)

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:37.073
Oh, Lord, I've lost...

(sniffles)

(sniffles)

I've let anger and fear
consume me, Lord.

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:09.480
But You haven't forsaken me.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.512
You never leave me.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.626
And You say in Your word,

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:23.219
if I'll just believe in You,

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.662
You will show me Your glory.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.996
Oh, please, please show me
Your glory, God.

(sniffles)

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:44.007
Forgive me, God, for not
being there for Eric that day.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.814

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:49.515

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.951
(sighs)

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.454
(sniffles)

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.064
Sweetheart,

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.534
can we talk?

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:41.297
Thank you.

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:47.539
First, I just want to apologize
for my behavior,

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:50.708
the way I've been acting,

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:54.219
the way I treated the family.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.755
I haven't been there for you,

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.789
I haven't been there
for Junior.

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:00.951
I haven't been there
for the church.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.892
L~\
\

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.658
I want to say I'm sorry.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.791
Thanks.

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:11.132
But I know
what we need to do.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.298
God has shown me
what we need to do now.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.774
What to...

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:18.936
What to do about what?
What do you mean?

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:23.342
We need
to forgive Maria Hernandez.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.180
We need to do whatever we can
to help out her family.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.514
- I know...
- David?

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.486
Please. Please.

01:17:29.612 --> 01:17:32.456
The Lord has put this
on my heart,

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:35.687
and I know it to be true.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.627
We need to forgive Maria.

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:40.798
And we also need

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:45.633
to find the person
that Eric saved.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.008
(Theresa sighs)

01:17:56.639 --> 01:17:58.380
Okay.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:02.512
All right.

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:04.522
'N.-

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:07.025
I-I get it.

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.519
We forgive.

01:18:15.558 --> 01:18:20.564
And we meet the person
that Eric saved.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.015
DAVID:
So,

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:30.879
what do you think?

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:32.576
Weather permitting,

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:35.188
and if we don't have
any major, unforeseen issues,

01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:38.918
ten months,
nine if we're lucky.

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.426
Great. When can you start?

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:46.199
You're just giving me the job?

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:47.892
You earned the job, John.

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:50.196
I mean, I can give you
some... some references.

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:52.533
-(Cecil laughs)
- That's not necessary.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.038
CECIL:
Oh, Mr. Danielson, you got it.

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:55.574
- Brother, congratulations.
-(David chuckles)

01:18:55.698 --> 01:18:56.938
- Thank you.
-(throat clearing)

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.602
All right, we'll finalize
all the details

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.577
and deposit the funds
into your account immediately.

01:19:00.703 --> 01:19:02.341
- Thank you, sir.
- DAVID: Thank you.

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:04.782
Whew! Wow. Okay.

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.922
(birds singing)

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:15.186
I offered him my references,
but he said he didn't need 'em.

01:19:15.284 --> 01:19:17.195
He didn't want 'em.
He just...

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:19.789
really didn't say anything
at all.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.560
Just gave me the job.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.796
I mean, who does that?

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.770
Who gives you a
half-a-million-dollar contract

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:28.272
like that?

01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:31.909
God does.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.782
Pray with me, John.

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:39.078
We need to thank Him
for all that He's done for us.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:45.249
Lord, You are
the most merciful,

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:48.157
and we know
that You hear our prayers,

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:52.289
and You answer them
when we need You the most.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:55.095
And You are the only authority
over time,

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:59.570
and Your timing has never been
more perfect and more...

01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:02.006
merciful.
(laughs)

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:05.279
And Lord,

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:08.814
we know You're good to those
whose hope is in You.

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:12.578
And if we seek You
with a quieted soul,

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.814
we'll be able to hear
Your whispers of goodness

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:17.116
all around us.

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:19.624
But if we're loud...

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:25.690

are filled with hate...

why don't you give God
some praise

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:54.293

Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:23.880
Sometimes tragedy...

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.390
strikes and happens.

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:31.055
And instead
of running toward God,

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:33.894
we get so angry"-

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:37.162
that we can't run away
from Him fast enough.

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:41.663
You see,
I know that to be true,

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:44.073
because it happened to me.

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:48.070
That's why I'm here,

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:51.377
ready and prepared
to humble myself

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:53.508
before the Lord.

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:55.815
As you all know,

01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:58.551
our son Eric's life

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.889
was cut short
by a terrible accident.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.729
We made a decision
to donate his organs.

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:12.263
I confess, I couldn't see

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:14.340
how I would ever forgive God

01:27:14.429 --> 01:27:17.876
for taking him away from us
at such a early age.

01:27:19.835 --> 01:27:23.248
I was so angry with God...

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:27.609
...I ran away from Him.

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.717
But not today.

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:35.021
Today I'm going to run
toward Him.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.189
'N.-

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:41.096
am gonna run toward God,

01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:45.035
and I'm gonna run toward God
as fast as I can.

01:27:46.061 --> 01:27:48.541
And I ask all in this house

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.803
to run with me.

01:27:55.237 --> 01:27:57.547
Today I'm gonna do
a little something different,

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:59.414
something I normally don't do.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.544
But I'm gonna tell you why.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.817
Because...

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:07.927
I think it's a privilege
to testify

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.995
on the power of God.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:14.658
I want to testify to the fact
that God transformed a heart,

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:18.932
and out of that transformation,
he birthed something amazing.

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.131
<i>Men'?</i>

01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:24.107
This is Kate Hernandez.

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:28.408
This beautiful young lady next
to her is her daughter Maria.

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:32.447
Maria, here...

01:28:32.574 --> 01:28:34.850
is a honor roll student.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:39.152
She has dreams and aspirations
to be the first in her family

01:28:39.281 --> 01:28:41.989
to go and to graduate
from college.

01:28:42.117 --> 01:28:45.929
Unfortunately,
those dreams and aspirations

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:49.127
have to be put aside
for a little while.

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.668
Maria, please.

01:28:56.798 --> 01:29:00.837
You see, Maria here...

01:29:00.969 --> 01:29:03.848
accidentally, while driving,

01:29:03.972 --> 01:29:06.543
struck and killed our son Eric.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.552
(Sniffs)

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:12.352
Mark 11 :25 tells us

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.359
that if you hold anything
against anyone,

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:17.156
forgive them,

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.492
so that your Father in heaven
will forgive you your sins.

01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:20.964
- Amen?
- Amen.

01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:22.660

a representative of my family.

01:29:29.898 --> 01:29:32.640
I want you to know...

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:35.305
that we forgive you.

01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:38.918
We forgive you.

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.348
And my prayer...

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:45.720
is that...

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:48.259
your heart
is no longer burdened

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:51.330
by the tragedy of that day.

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:54.025
You see, the forgiveness of God

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:56.726
is granted to us all

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:59.839
-by the blood of Jesus Christ.
- Yes.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:05.439
Now, if you're willing
this day, Maria,

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:08.741

as a daughter.
