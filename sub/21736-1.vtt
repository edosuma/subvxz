Has anyone called 911?

00:17.012 --> 00:18.856
Look out!
Stand back!

00:21.449 --> 00:23.526
Did anyone call 911?

00:26.124 --> 00:28.291
Send paramedics right away!

00:28.316 --> 00:29.865
Please hurry!

00:30.703 --> 00:34.423
<i>- 23, we have a 10-55

- Quickly! Over here. Spot!
- You didn't see it?

01:05.594 --> 01:07.077
Check the other car!

01:07.077 --> 01:09.244
Over here, we need someone here, please!

01:10.134 --> 01:12.673
Oh, my God!
That's Andrew!

01:16.527 --> 01:19.192
Andrew? It's OK. I'm here.

01:19.217 --> 01:20.795
Lock it up!

01:22.115 --> 01:24.117
You know him?

01:24.299 --> 01:26.043
He's my husband.

01:38.378 --> 01:40.510
I need a respirator here, please.

01:45.448 --> 01:47.300
- You're still here.
- Yeah.

01:47.473 --> 01:49.932
So, Closs and Brinks are
gonna cover for us.

01:49.959 --> 01:51.201
They send their best.

01:51.201 --> 01:52.929
God, it's so nice of them.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.519
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

01:55.317 --> 01:56.949
Any news?

01:57.461 --> 01:59.885
I'm still waiting to hear.

02:02.178 --> 02:04.339
We finally got him stabilized.

02:04.339 --> 02:06.520
You can go in see him now.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.551
- I'll be in in a minute.
- OK.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.608
So glad you're OK.

02:13.035 --> 02:14.700
I was so worried.

02:17.571 --> 02:21.535
How are the... people in the other car?
Are they OK?

02:21.920 --> 02:25.147
Twenty-one year-old girl,
died at the scene.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.785
I'm pretty sure she was
above the legal limit.

02:28.681 --> 02:29.675
OK.

02:30.329 --> 02:33.562
Someone's pretty sure
that they saw her run the red light.

02:37.806 --> 02:39.947
I'll leave you guys to it.

02:41.612 --> 02:43.309
- Andrew.
- Mhm.

02:43.832 --> 02:45.277
How are you feeling?

02:45.356 --> 02:48.095
Terribly feel much anything
at the moment, so...

02:48.189 --> 02:50.632
Guessing the painkillers
are working pretty good.

02:50.679 --> 02:52.795
Or you should buy a lottery ticket.

02:52.890 --> 02:55.884
As I told your wife,
you were very lucky.

02:55.953 --> 02:57.418
Contusions and,

02:57.418 --> 03:01.253
torn ligaments, two broken ribs,
which will heal on their own.

03:01.586 --> 03:04.939
I'm more concerned about
a spleen hematoma, so...

03:04.939 --> 03:06.956
I've ordered a CT scan.

03:06.956 --> 03:10.447
Uhm, if my spleen's OK, I'm to expect
a full recovery, though, right?

03:10.447 --> 03:12.382
Eventually, yeah.

03:12.796 --> 03:15.101
Broken ribs do tickle
while they heal, so...

03:15.101 --> 03:17.789
may be uncomfortable or even painful,

03:17.789 --> 03:19.788
to sit for long periods.

03:20.031 --> 03:21.580
You mean
like in a car?

03:21.580 --> 03:24.173
It's OK.
We'll figure it out.

03:24.934 --> 03:26.100
It's OK.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.609
Relax, people recover better.

03:29.548 --> 03:31.784
Hey, just focus on healing.

03:32.442 --> 03:33.706
It's OK.

03:37.212 --> 03:40.118
What are you gonna do now
that Andrew's basically unemployed?

03:40.158 --> 03:41.798
I have no idea.

03:41.798 --> 03:43.475
What about your
Mom's life insurance?

03:43.475 --> 03:45.661
How do you think we got a
down-payment on this place?

03:46.488 --> 03:47.866
So, sell it!

03:47.895 --> 03:50.184
Downsize! You don't
need three bedrooms.

03:50.184 --> 03:53.738
No, the market's changed a lot since
we bought. We'd lose a lot of money.

03:54.766 --> 03:57.573
Besides, I can't imagine
living with Andrew laid up.

03:59.529 --> 04:01.145
I know what you should do!

04:01.230 --> 04:04.162
Rent out one of your spare
rooms on Vacay N' Stay.

04:04.187 --> 04:06.343
My co-worker Ellie rents
one of her spare rooms,

04:06.343 --> 04:08.805
and she makes four grand a month.
More than her mortgage.

04:08.805 --> 04:10.046
- No.
- Why not?

04:10.046 --> 04:12.055
Because I don't want random
strangers as room-mates.

04:12.055 --> 04:13.663
It's not like that. You
can screen your guests

04:13.663 --> 04:15.647
and you can hand-pick
them to your like.

04:16.197 --> 04:17.274
No.

04:20.487 --> 04:21.872
What are you doing?

04:21.872 --> 04:24.021
One-twenty-five times two...

04:24.021 --> 04:26.218
That's what you'd be making a month.

04:26.781 --> 04:29.147
- No way.
- Mhm...

04:31.830 --> 04:34.470
So, if you look here,
you can click on a particular guest,

04:34.470 --> 04:36.310
and see what the host
has to say about them.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.300
For example, there are six hosts
here that like this guest.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.762
He's a great guest.

04:40.762 --> 04:42.864
We liked having him stay,
yadi-yadi-yada...

04:42.864 --> 04:44.926
and if you have
a bad experience with the guest...

04:44.951 --> 04:47.484
You can report them by clicking here.

04:47.714 --> 04:50.317
Hmm, do I get to check
them out before I...

04:50.521 --> 04:52.447
agree to let them stay here?

04:52.472 --> 04:55.349
- Before you host them?
- Yeah. - Exactly.

04:55.349 --> 04:57.311
Oh, and your money is deposited
right into your account

04:57.311 --> 04:59.857
after they check in so you
don't have to collect it.

05:01.617 --> 05:04.009
This is sounding a lot
cooler than I thought.

05:04.034 --> 05:07.779
Like I said, my friend Ellie
makes a lot of money doing it.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.784
Allowed her to go there into part-time,
she makes more money doing this,

05:10.784 --> 05:13.169
than she does when she
was working full-time.

05:22.825 --> 05:24.483
There you are.

05:26.342 --> 05:28.241
I finally found you.

05:30.207 --> 05:31.900
What are you cooking off?

05:31.925 --> 05:32.962
Nothing.

05:32.962 --> 05:35.911
You know, you you were supposed
to be here over an hour ago.

05:37.262 --> 05:38.919
I was with Devin.

05:40.232 --> 05:41.826
He said he saw you
getting real cosy

05:41.826 --> 05:44.127
with some long-haired guy
at the club last night.

05:44.212 --> 05:46.576
- You're sleeping with that guy?
- Oh, give me a break!

05:46.576 --> 05:50.317
- I'm so over this. - Hey! Answer
the question, you stupid slut!

05:50.502 --> 05:53.081
What is on that computer
you don't want me to see?

05:55.666 --> 05:57.275
Stupid bitch!

05:58.836 --> 06:00.595
How much this cost me?

06:00.625 --> 06:03.315
Take it out of the two
thousand dollars you owe me.

06:03.394 --> 06:05.183
God, you're such a loser.

06:05.208 --> 06:06.708
- I'm a loser?
- Yeah.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.778
What about you? You're nothing
but a low-rent skank.

06:08.778 --> 06:10.251
Oh, I'm a low-rent skank?

06:10.251 --> 06:13.075
Yeah, you think you're so important
because you roll around on stage...

06:13.075 --> 06:14.886
Guys throw a couple
of bucks at you?

06:14.886 --> 06:17.960
Nothing but a dirty...
nasty...

06:18.421 --> 06:20.009
Little slut.

06:23.444 --> 06:25.365
Disagree, right?

06:36.399 --> 06:39.707
Up to four thousand
dollars extra a month.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.976
It's actually so much
better than I thought.

06:41.976 --> 06:44.423
Oh, come on, you don't wanna let
some weirdo come and stay with us.

06:44.423 --> 06:46.908
No, I wanna rent out
two of our rooms to...

06:46.951 --> 06:49.791
clean, responsible, mature adults.

06:50.539 --> 06:53.719
We don't really have much of a choice,
we have to do something.

06:54.241 --> 06:56.929
Two of our credit cards are maxed,

06:56.968 --> 06:58.836
I had to go into our
savings for our mortgage,

06:58.836 --> 07:01.915
and in another month, I'm gonna
have to cash out with the IRA.

07:03.864 --> 07:07.039
Even just for a little bit until we figure
out what we're gonna do for a drop.

07:07.039 --> 07:08.201
OK.

07:08.288 --> 07:10.683
All right. Just give it a shot.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.984
But if we get even
just one weirdo...

07:13.793 --> 07:16.832
I'm closing down Hexley Inn for good.

07:34.296 --> 07:36.789
Please, give me a good guest.

07:38.522 --> 07:40.373
Soon...

07:57.364 --> 07:59.968
I'm surprised you were able
to talk Andrew into doing this,

07:59.968 --> 08:02.295
you know he hates having
other people on his space.

08:02.295 --> 08:05.541
- You know, I think it's a just a
Big Brother thing. - Aha. - Hmm.

08:05.566 --> 08:07.902
Like we didn't have much of a choice.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.946
Could be months until he's back to work.

08:11.039 --> 08:13.938
I hope that's someone
booking in a reservation.

08:15.826 --> 08:18.007
Check it out.
I got two people booked-in.

08:18.007 --> 08:20.836
One for two days and one for five.

08:20.896 --> 08:23.435
And then I've someone else
who wants to stay for eight days.

08:23.429 --> 08:26.863
Wow! Eight days!
What's she coming into town for?

08:27.567 --> 08:30.491
Work. Miranda from Portland.

08:30.491 --> 08:32.412
She's never done
Vacay N' Stay before,

08:32.412 --> 08:33.948
but it does look like she's
done a lot of traveling,

08:33.948 --> 08:36.192
she has pictures of her friends,
the DR...

08:36.192 --> 08:37.167
She's cute!

08:37.167 --> 08:39.654
- And what does she do for work?
-No, this is not your dating service.

08:39.654 --> 08:42.216
- Who says I need a service?
- Get out!

08:44.581 --> 08:45.958
She'll be up for work?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.512
- Yeah, she's a trainer at
the Daxon Hotel. - Mhm.

08:48.518 --> 08:51.590
They're opening a new one next month.
She's in the trainer room.

08:51.683 --> 08:54.840
So, she works at a hotel
but she's staying at a Vacay N' Stay?

08:54.840 --> 08:56.869
He said the same thing.

08:56.907 --> 08:58.936
She says she gets
a per Diem and...

08:58.936 --> 09:01.484
would rather stay
with people than be alone, so...

09:01.484 --> 09:03.465
I guess if you travel all the
time you get real lonely...

09:03.465 --> 09:07.022
<i>- 23. We have a 9-4-A
at 3324 Oakworth Avenue.</i>

09:07.022 --> 09:08.621
<i>Male juvenile.
Unresponsive.</i>

09:08.631 --> 09:10.402
- 10-A.
23 on the way.

09:19.117 --> 09:22.514
So, like, what am I supposed to tell
the regulars when they ask about you?

09:22.551 --> 09:26.309
Tell them some rich heir
asked me to marry him and I said yes.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.898
Thanks for letting me stay.

09:28.898 --> 09:31.551
<i>Oh, Te voy a extrañar.</i>

09:31.551 --> 09:33.848
<i>También, babe.</i>

09:59.424 --> 10:02.067
Hi!
You must be Miranda!

10:02.067 --> 10:04.694
- That's me.
- Come on in!

10:05.522 --> 10:06.728
Thank you.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.860
This is your room.

10:14.860 --> 10:17.864
Oh, wow!
It looks just like the pictures.

10:17.864 --> 10:22.676
Ahm, the keys. So these are for you
to lock up after you leave.

10:22.742 --> 10:24.993
And I wrote down
just a little list of rules.

10:24.993 --> 10:26.370
Basically,
no smoking...

10:26.395 --> 10:28.355
And you've access to everything,

10:28.355 --> 10:30.992
except for the den
and the master bedroom.

10:31.117 --> 10:34.152
And if you've any guests overnight,
just maybe let me know first.

10:34.152 --> 10:36.427
- Yeah, sounds reasonable.
- OK.

10:36.466 --> 10:37.997
You want a coffee?
I was gonna make some.

10:37.997 --> 10:39.818
Yes, please.

10:39.818 --> 10:42.360
All right. I'll let you get settled.
Just come down whenever you're ready.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.290
OK.
Thank you.

10:59.354 --> 11:03.487
Daxon owns 1600 hotels nationwide
and when they open a new one,

11:03.487 --> 11:06.272
I go down for about a week
and help train staff.

11:06.401 --> 11:08.502
I heard that they have
one of the best...

11:08.502 --> 11:11.528
pension programs in the
hospitality business.

11:12.013 --> 11:13.709
Is that your husband?

11:14.740 --> 11:17.931
Yeah. That was on vacation two
years ago. We went to Canada.

11:17.931 --> 11:19.575
Oh, wow!

11:20.187 --> 11:23.183
What does he do? I think you
mentioned it on your profile but...

11:23.399 --> 11:24.569
I forgot.

11:24.569 --> 11:26.448
Pharmaceutical sales.

11:26.467 --> 11:29.528
Or... he did. I don't know what
he's gonna do now.

11:29.799 --> 11:32.209
Oh, he got fired or something?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.066
No, nothing like that.

11:34.091 --> 11:36.612
He was in a pretty bad car accident.
He's in hospital.

11:36.637 --> 11:39.538
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Is he gonna be OK?

11:39.538 --> 11:40.684
Yeah.

11:40.957 --> 11:43.779
Yeah, he hurt his ribs pretty badly.

11:44.064 --> 11:47.204
And he has to sit a lot
in the car for work, so...

11:47.204 --> 11:49.490
- I don't know.
- That's terrible.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.704
Let me know if there's
anything I can do.

11:53.061 --> 11:55.927
Thanks. Appreciate it.

12:13.206 --> 12:15.034
Yes! Nice.

12:38.911 --> 12:41.329
One, two, three...

12:59.377 --> 13:01.854
We're three for three with good renters.

13:02.169 --> 13:03.979
We should've done this months ago.

13:05.715 --> 13:07.345
So, a woman got there?

13:07.370 --> 13:09.478
- What's her name?
- Miranda.

13:09.561 --> 13:10.908
What's she like?

13:11.501 --> 13:13.990
Nice. We talked for about an hour.

13:14.017 --> 13:16.339
- Hm. - She's never been to Philly
and she wants a cheese steak.

13:16.339 --> 13:20.070
- Cheese steaks. - Maybe if you're
lucky, I'll bring one for you.

13:20.214 --> 13:21.424
Lucky!

13:23.383 --> 13:25.127
This is all working out.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.043
Aubrey was right.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.481
Aww, you're cute!

14:12.975 --> 14:14.607
She's in the kitchen.

14:14.607 --> 14:16.001
That way!

14:25.184 --> 14:27.213
Three's a crowd, Wally.

14:28.140 --> 14:30.466
I'm so sorry about your mother.

14:30.466 --> 14:33.644
She must have done it right
after I left this morning.

14:34.951 --> 14:38.849
She was so depressed, I mean,
I never should've left her alone.

14:44.059 --> 14:47.430
I lost my mother to suicide as well.

14:48.169 --> 14:50.428
She was diagnosed with cancer.

14:51.093 --> 14:53.313
And we decided we were gonna fight it.

14:54.167 --> 14:55.714
But, erm...

14:55.768 --> 14:58.581
She wanted to go to Mexico by herself.

14:58.740 --> 15:01.373
Just to relax...

15:03.373 --> 15:06.799
She killed herself in her hotel room.

15:09.932 --> 15:11.383
Emily...

15:11.840 --> 15:15.698
You cannot feel responsible
for what has happened.

15:16.740 --> 15:21.007
They do it when they know
that we will not be there to help them.

15:22.287 --> 15:25.166
Honey, this isn't in no way...

15:25.449 --> 15:26.847
your fault.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.957
Karen!

15:34.525 --> 15:37.096
The detective needs
to talk to you now, OK?

15:37.362 --> 15:38.719
OK.

15:39.752 --> 15:41.167
Thank you.

16:27.565 --> 16:28.946
What is all this?

16:28.946 --> 16:32.560
Just my way of saying thank you
for letting me stay.

16:33.001 --> 16:34.650
OK, so...

16:34.985 --> 16:38.577
What kind of cheese do you like?
American, Swiss Cheddar?

16:38.577 --> 16:41.993
- Wow! Ahm, Swiss!
- Perfect!

16:41.993 --> 16:43.491
So, how was work last night?

16:43.491 --> 16:45.834
I didn't hear you come in.
You're so tired.

16:45.834 --> 16:48.732
- Rough.
- Really? What kind of calls?

16:48.732 --> 16:52.478
Two car accidents. Mostly nothing.
Heart attack...

16:52.478 --> 16:55.507
The worst was a 21 year-old
who lost her mother.

16:55.645 --> 16:58.101
She shot herself that morning.

16:58.617 --> 17:00.800
So young to lose your mother...

17:03.222 --> 17:07.183
I don't know how you do it.
Seeing all these dead bodies is just...

17:07.183 --> 17:09.279
See them lose an amount
of blood and I'm like...

17:09.279 --> 17:10.926
light headed.

17:10.926 --> 17:12.784
No, those aren’t the hard ones.

17:12.784 --> 17:14.228
They're already gone.

17:14.228 --> 17:16.075
It's when you wanna save
someone and you can't.

17:16.075 --> 17:18.167
That's what I lose
some sleep over.

17:21.617 --> 17:23.583
I gotta get ready for work.

17:24.115 --> 17:27.770
I work night tonight but tomorrow I'm
off if you wanna got to Michael's.

17:27.770 --> 17:29.688
- The restaurant I was
telling you about? - Yeah.

17:29.688 --> 17:31.703
Yeah, that would be great. Ahm...

17:31.867 --> 17:35.226
- I finish training around four.
- All right, it's a date.

17:35.351 --> 17:37.162
Thanks again for lunch.

17:37.162 --> 17:38.853
No problem.

17:42.955 --> 17:44.300
What?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.129
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

17:51.129 --> 17:53.234
It's not working.
It was fine last night.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.206
Maybe it's the starter.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.521
I don't know what it is
but I cannot do this right now.

17:58.521 --> 18:00.581
Well, if you want,
I can drive you.

18:00.994 --> 18:03.902
- You have a car?
- Yeah, I have a rental, right there.

18:06.203 --> 18:08.550
- OK.
- Yeah. Let's go.

18:09.536 --> 18:12.877
Oh, crap!
I forgot Andrew's paperwork.

18:12.963 --> 18:14.162
What paperwork?

18:14.162 --> 18:18.184
I left it right in the front entryway.
It's some forms from his work.

18:19.102 --> 18:21.349
It's OK. I'm just gonna call his
brother, see if he can pick it up

18:21.349 --> 18:23.089
and then maybe he can
check on the car.

18:23.089 --> 18:25.101
- I'll do it! - No, no, no.
I can't ask you to do that.

18:25.101 --> 18:27.257
No, honestly, it's fine.
I can do it right after work.

18:27.257 --> 18:30.781
Erm, it'll be like late afternoon,
early evening, something like that?

18:30.781 --> 18:33.128
- Are you sure?
- Please, honestly, it's no problem.

18:33.128 --> 18:37.685
Just text me the hospital name
and his room number and I'll do it.

18:38.103 --> 18:39.397
Thanks!

18:39.546 --> 18:41.322
I owe you.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.713
No problem.

19:18.674 --> 19:21.211
- Thanks for doing this.
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

19:21.211 --> 19:23.549
Anything to help Karen out.
She's been great.

19:23.549 --> 19:25.146
Yeah, I'm pretty lucky.

19:25.146 --> 19:27.603
Oh, well, she says
the same about you.

19:27.603 --> 19:31.747
I saw pictures of you two vacationing
and one with you and your brother, so...

19:31.747 --> 19:34.445
I kind of feel like I know you.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.070
So, is she saying any
embarrassing stuff about me?

19:37.070 --> 19:39.559
No, no, no.
It was all good.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.993
- That's good.
- Yeah.

19:42.271 --> 19:46.331
So, ahm, you just have that one brother?

19:46.331 --> 19:48.322
Yeah, yeah.
Tyler.

19:48.322 --> 19:51.174
Must be nice.
I was an only child growing up.

19:51.174 --> 19:53.110
Oh, so is Karen.

19:53.139 --> 19:54.633
I think she always
wanted a sister, though.

19:54.633 --> 19:57.398
Oh, really?
Yeah, me too.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.210
Yeah, my Mum died
from a rare bone disease.

20:00.210 --> 20:02.110
So, erm...

20:02.540 --> 20:04.392
It was really awful.

20:05.119 --> 20:06.856
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:08.830 --> 20:11.457
Did - did Karen tell you about her Mum?

20:12.138 --> 20:13.199
Mhm-mm.

20:13.199 --> 20:18.762
Well, I'll let her tell you but - but
she lost her Mum about six months ago.

20:19.599 --> 20:20.881
Was she sick?

20:22.177 --> 20:25.287
- I should probably let her tell you.
- Yeah, I know, of course.

20:25.287 --> 20:30.028
I feel like if anyone can handle that,
it's Karen in her line of work.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.858
Well, it's very difficult
when it's your own family.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.586
It was pretty
devastating for her.

20:35.586 --> 20:37.155
Both of us, actually.

20:37.155 --> 20:40.809
And she was...
she was a wonderful woman.

20:43.461 --> 20:45.988
I was never close to my Mum
until the end.

20:45.988 --> 20:50.720
Well, you know, tragedy has a way
of bringing people closer together.

20:51.715 --> 20:53.429
So true.

20:56.723 --> 21:00.037
Anyway, I should get going,
so I'll let you rest.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.333
Yeah.

21:01.932 --> 21:04.371
- It's been fun to meet you.
- Yeah, it's good to meet you.

21:04.452 --> 21:07.366
- So, I'll see you later. - Yeah, I'll
see you at the house at some point.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.537
- OK. Good-night!
- Bye.

21:12.095 --> 21:13.721
Chayanne?

21:13.783 --> 21:15.127
Chayanne!

21:15.994 --> 21:18.589
Hey, girl. Are you trying
to ignore me or what?

21:18.589 --> 21:19.933
JoJo!

21:19.933 --> 21:23.650
- What are you doing here?
- You mean in Philly or the hospital?

21:24.619 --> 21:25.759
Both.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.051
I moved here about six weeks ago.

21:28.051 --> 21:30.337
Followed a guy,
he ended up being married.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.778
A long story.
Boring.

21:31.778 --> 21:33.305
I got a job and I stayed.

21:33.305 --> 21:35.650
The hospital part is not
as bad as it seems.

21:35.650 --> 21:38.630
I was visiting a friend
who popped out a baby boy yesterday.

21:38.742 --> 21:40.403
So, how about you?

21:40.791 --> 21:43.985
I - I'm looking for work out here.

21:43.985 --> 21:46.311
I- I actually go by Miranda now.

21:46.311 --> 21:49.539
Oh, yeah? You gave up on that
glamor slave from Portland, huh?

21:49.564 --> 21:51.359
- Well, I'm not sure I'd say that but...

21:51.359 --> 21:52.969
Me either.

21:52.969 --> 21:54.493
Hey, you wanna
grab a drink?

21:54.493 --> 21:57.064
There's a place I like just
up the street. I can drive.

21:58.814 --> 22:00.481
Sure. Yeah.

22:00.857 --> 22:02.822
So, Miranda, huh?

22:02.943 --> 22:05.092
I'm so used to calling you Chayanne.

22:05.117 --> 22:07.323
I know.
Why don't you ever use the stage name?

22:07.352 --> 22:10.328
What difference does it make? Most
guys just call you "Baby", anyways...

22:10.328 --> 22:11.343
Yeah.

22:11.343 --> 22:12.816
So, what about you?

22:12.816 --> 22:14.504
Somebody told me that
you were doing time.

22:14.521 --> 22:15.947
Uggh, that was a while ago.

22:15.947 --> 22:18.385
I just spent three months in County
for lifting a pair of heels.

22:18.410 --> 22:20.682
- Oh, that sucks.
- Well worthy, yeah?

22:22.149 --> 22:23.791
Oh, yeah.

22:24.232 --> 22:25.551
So, where are you
working out here?

22:25.551 --> 22:28.578
Oh, I found this nice little joint
called "The Kitty Cat Room"

22:28.578 --> 22:31.264
It's the only strip club in that area.
I make bank.

22:31.264 --> 22:34.213
- Oh, bank?
- Mhmmm. - Are they hiring?

22:34.213 --> 22:36.176
I can totally set up
an interview for you.

22:36.217 --> 22:38.419
- That'd be amazing.
- Really? - Yeah!

22:45.180 --> 22:47.044
It was going so well.

22:51.675 --> 22:53.470
Good morning!

22:53.470 --> 22:55.959
Morning.
I like your top.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.803
Oh, thank you.
You can borrow it anytime you like.

23:00.230 --> 23:04.387
So, I thought that I'd prove
to us both that I can make waffles.

23:04.813 --> 23:07.300
Even though I burnt the first two.

23:08.062 --> 23:10.698
Is everything OK?
You seem a little bit off today.

23:10.985 --> 23:12.196
Yeah.

23:12.196 --> 23:14.213
I'm just trying to figure out
this whole Vacay N' Stay thing.

23:14.213 --> 23:16.466
Everything was going great,
and now, nothing.

23:16.477 --> 23:20.293
Just this one guy who's booked-in
for five days from Vancouver.

23:20.612 --> 23:22.495
A guy from Vancouver?

23:22.782 --> 23:24.934
Yeah, he was the
first one that booked-in.

23:24.934 --> 23:28.560
- He said he was on some
spiritual journey. - Hmm.

23:28.679 --> 23:30.651
That's really cool.
When is that happening?

23:30.651 --> 23:32.231
The day after tomorrow.

23:33.006 --> 23:34.097
Wow!

23:34.097 --> 23:37.288
These waffles look amazing.
I'm definitely skipping lunch.

23:37.399 --> 23:40.625
So I'm ready for cheese-stakes tonight.

23:40.849 --> 23:43.499
- Oh, no. Tonight?
- Yeah.

23:43.524 --> 23:45.031
It's Monday, right?

23:45.645 --> 23:46.808
Right.

23:46.856 --> 23:49.438
Yeah, no, I just - I forgot
that I told my friend Aubrey

23:49.438 --> 23:51.394
that I'd have dinner
with her tonight.

23:51.949 --> 23:54.145
Hmm, erm,

23:54.145 --> 23:56.647
can't you re-schedule
or something?

23:56.950 --> 24:00.601
No, I'm sorry. Never mind.
I don't want you to do that.

24:01.335 --> 24:05.224
You know what? Just text me
the place and I'll find it.

24:07.471 --> 24:10.159
You know what?
Aubrey is really cool.

24:10.159 --> 24:13.673
She's my best friend from college.
You'll probably really like her.

24:14.698 --> 24:16.893
Why don't the three of us just go?

24:18.518 --> 24:20.823
OK. Great.

24:21.916 --> 24:23.427
Syrup?

24:29.604 --> 24:31.514
All right. Well...

24:32.446 --> 24:33.853
Car looks like
it's running fine.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.373
I'm not exactly sure
why it wouldn't start.

24:35.373 --> 24:37.163
Really?
That's so weird.

24:38.347 --> 24:41.231
This is Miranda. She's the one
that's renting the Vacay N' Stay.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.476
- Hi.
- Mhm...

24:42.560 --> 24:44.106
I'm all greasy.

24:44.131 --> 24:45.743
It washes off, right?

24:45.847 --> 24:47.524
- Yeah!
- Good!

24:48.473 --> 24:50.223
This is Tyler.
He's Andrew's brother.

24:50.223 --> 24:52.227
He's been helping out a lot
since the accident.

24:52.227 --> 24:54.030
Well, actually, I've been helping
out for longer than that.

24:54.030 --> 24:56.474
Unfortunately for Karen,
she married a pencil-pusher.

24:56.474 --> 24:59.776
- Well, I'm a a pencil-pusher and I
know my way around the car. - Do you?

24:59.801 --> 25:01.439
OK, then maybe you can help me out.

25:01.439 --> 25:05.071
Erm... what is that right there?

25:05.071 --> 25:06.194
If you're gonna try
to trick me up,

25:06.194 --> 25:08.122
you gotta do better than that.
That's an alternator.

25:08.122 --> 25:10.650
OK. And what is
that back there?

25:10.675 --> 25:12.541
That is an in-take manifold.

25:13.072 --> 25:15.057
Ding- Ding! Game over.
I win.

25:15.082 --> 25:16.564
I'm impressed!

25:16.683 --> 25:18.644
- I grew up a tomboy.
- Did you?

25:18.644 --> 25:21.034
OK, not to interrupt but we
gotta finish getting ready.

25:21.034 --> 25:22.101
We're gonna have
dinner with Aubrey.

25:22.101 --> 25:24.027
OK, the car looks
like it's running fine

25:24.027 --> 25:25.913
but if anything goes wrong,
give me a shout.

25:25.913 --> 25:27.336
- Thanks. I will.
-OK.

25:27.336 --> 25:30.500
- It was nice meeting you. - Yeah, you
too, hope to see you again. -Yeah.

25:34.577 --> 25:36.863
He's got a really good build too.

25:36.924 --> 25:38.641
You know who he reminds me of?

25:38.641 --> 25:42.026
That guy, Reggie, from senior year.
Remember him?

25:42.464 --> 25:44.064
Oh, yeah.

25:44.064 --> 25:47.612
Anyway, I must say no 'cause
I'm so sick of dating guys with kids.

25:47.637 --> 25:49.225
- Remember what happened
with that guy, Mark?

25:49.225 --> 25:51.374
- With three kids?
- Yeah.

25:51.713 --> 25:53.794
What about you, Miranda?
Are you seeing anyone?

25:53.794 --> 25:54.921
No.

25:55.165 --> 25:57.921
I was for a few months
but it didn't work out.

25:58.304 --> 25:59.426
Why not?

25:59.426 --> 26:01.670
The problem with having
kids isn't the kids.

26:01.788 --> 26:04.248
It's that they're still
completely tied to their ex.

26:04.358 --> 26:06.863
My guy, Mark, was basically
paying for child support,

26:06.863 --> 26:09.504
his ex's apartment
and her car.

26:09.504 --> 26:11.240
He paid for her car?
Why?

26:11.240 --> 26:15.127
I don't know, some crap about wanting
a safe car to run her little brats around.

26:15.483 --> 26:18.230
- I could understand that, I guess.
- Mhm.

26:19.009 --> 26:20.282
I don't know where
the waitress is.

26:20.282 --> 26:21.873
I'm gonna go get more wine.
Are you guys good?

26:21.873 --> 26:24.889
- Anyone?
- No, thank you.

26:26.237 --> 26:27.721
So, erm...

26:27.853 --> 26:29.687
You've know Karen since college?

26:29.687 --> 26:31.567
She's my big sis.

26:31.567 --> 26:33.889
- Huh?
- Sorority sisters.

26:34.347 --> 26:36.338
Delta Psi Beta?

26:36.801 --> 26:38.917
I take it you weren't in a sorority?

26:40.335 --> 26:44.843
On every pledge, you get hooked up
with a junior and become a big sister.

26:47.207 --> 26:49.310
So, it's like a forced friendship.

26:49.310 --> 26:50.706
Hardly.

26:52.182 --> 26:54.203
It's a very strong bond.

26:54.203 --> 26:56.267
Karen and I are best friends.

26:58.453 --> 27:02.118
I'm sure it's nothing compared
to having an actual real sister.

27:02.686 --> 27:03.520
What?

27:03.520 --> 27:05.604
Please, you're comparing
your relationship

27:05.961 --> 27:08.430
like... with a blood relative
that's absolutely ridiculous.

27:08.430 --> 27:10.179
Obviously you're not familiar
with the Greek system, huh?

27:10.179 --> 27:13.333
- I don't see how it matters.
- That's why you don't understand.

27:24.468 --> 27:27.242
Excuse me.
I need to use the restroom.

27:40.472 --> 27:42.000
Stop it!

27:43.418 --> 27:47.917
You are nice, sweet...
innocent Miranda.

27:48.676 --> 27:52.837
You need to let that bitch...
just be a bitch.

27:53.006 --> 27:57.501
Get on with kindness,
or something like that.

27:58.407 --> 28:02.152
And you think she meant that
to be intentionally rude?

28:02.364 --> 28:03.584
Kinda...

28:03.961 --> 28:05.915
I don't think she
meant anything by it.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.424
- Don't worry about...
- You are so right about this place.

28:08.449 --> 28:11.155
You cannot get cheese-stakes
like this in Oregon.

28:11.205 --> 28:13.331
Isn't it good?
It's one of my favourite spots.

28:13.331 --> 28:16.285
You have to promise me that
we'll come here before I leave.

28:16.285 --> 28:17.944
Absolutely!

28:31.664 --> 28:33.864
So, you're staying
for another week...

28:33.864 --> 28:35.528
Yeah, if that's OK.

28:35.528 --> 28:38.165
They asked me to stay on a extra
week to do some additional training.

28:38.165 --> 28:39.716
I mean, unless you've
the room rented already.

28:39.716 --> 28:42.029
No, no, no.. that...
it should be fine.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.758
OK, that'll be great.
OK, so then maybe on your next day off,

28:44.758 --> 28:47.470
we can go shopping
or do something really fun...

28:47.644 --> 28:50.415
Yeah... erm...
that might work.

28:50.497 --> 28:54.358
I'm so excited!
Yeah, we're gonna have so much fun.

28:54.358 --> 28:55.387
OK.

28:55.438 --> 28:59.434
- Well, then, I'll go make the payment.
- OK.

29:15.543 --> 29:17.286
- Karen?
- No.

29:18.385 --> 29:19.967
Miranda.

29:20.112 --> 29:21.170
Hi!

29:21.170 --> 29:23.572
I'm Karen.
You must be Evander.

29:23.572 --> 29:25.102
The one and only.

29:25.267 --> 29:27.818
Erm, you took the train in, right?
How was it?

29:27.818 --> 29:29.278
Absolutely wonderful.

29:29.303 --> 29:31.718
You really get to see the country
when you travel by train.

29:31.805 --> 29:32.839
I bet.

29:33.095 --> 29:35.830
I can show you to your room,
it's upstairs.

29:35.830 --> 29:36.934
Thanks.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.119
I can only give you daytime right now.

29:52.162 --> 29:54.451
Oh, that's fine.
My nights, they're...

29:54.698 --> 29:56.767
kind of... they're not
free right now, so...

29:56.792 --> 29:58.736
Perfect.
You're hired.

29:59.952 --> 30:02.023
You don't wanna see me dance?

30:02.768 --> 30:03.829
Honey...

30:04.840 --> 30:07.904
I don't care if you get up there
and do the Macarena...

30:07.904 --> 30:09.565
as long as you bring in customers.

30:09.565 --> 30:10.847
Deal!

30:16.977 --> 30:19.548
Doctor Mosley said
I have to make you walk.

30:19.548 --> 30:20.830
Yeah, I know.

30:21.438 --> 30:25.090
Hey, so it looks like I'm coming home
to a full house on Tuesday, huh?

30:25.704 --> 30:27.524
It's not too bad.

30:27.780 --> 30:30.045
- Evander is hardly there.
- Yeah.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.942
And... Miranda?

30:33.293 --> 30:34.917
She's always there.

30:35.151 --> 30:37.786
Oh, boy, was it me
or I thought you liked her?

30:38.456 --> 30:41.078
I do.
She's pleasant enough.

30:41.331 --> 30:44.357
She just always wants to spend
time with me. I'm never alone.

30:45.326 --> 30:48.413
Yeah, well, you know,
she doesn't really know anybody else.

30:49.777 --> 30:52.018
Yeah, she's been a good enough guest.

30:53.695 --> 30:56.177
I'm just pretty independent,
you know...

30:56.177 --> 30:57.208
Yeah...

30:57.426 --> 30:59.032
Yeah, that you are.

30:59.359 --> 31:00.908
That you are.

31:03.888 --> 31:06.709
Not everyone's good
in stressful situations.

31:07.074 --> 31:10.127
I'm guessing you are...
or you wouldn't be an EMT.

31:10.561 --> 31:12.004
But it might be one of the things that,

31:12.004 --> 31:13.933
balances you and Andrew out.

31:14.098 --> 31:16.997
Sounds like, in general,
you two are fairly balanced.

31:16.997 --> 31:19.854
- Hey, guys!
- Oh, hey, Miranda!

31:19.879 --> 31:21.623
Am I interrupting something?

31:21.623 --> 31:23.683
No, we were just chatting.

31:23.843 --> 31:26.596
You should try Evander's salsa.
It's one of the best I've ever had.

31:26.596 --> 31:29.407
I picked up the recipe when I was driving
through New Orleans in the 80's.

31:29.407 --> 31:32.555
Mhm... I'm not a big salsa fan, so...

31:32.783 --> 31:34.640
Anyway, look what I got us.

31:34.640 --> 31:37.706
I thought we can drink some wine tonight
and watch "The Bridges of Madison County".

31:37.997 --> 31:40.312
How did you know that
was my favourite movie?

31:40.790 --> 31:42.607
I didn't. I just...

31:42.607 --> 31:45.479
- I saw the DVR, that's all.
- Oh.

31:46.244 --> 31:50.199
I think I'm just gonna have a bath...
read a book.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.525
I could use a bit of alone time...

31:53.334 --> 31:54.682
I understand.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.063
All right, you guys,
I'm gonna go up.

31:58.088 --> 31:59.212
Good-night.

31:59.396 --> 32:02.415
Thank you again for the talk
and good-night.

32:02.415 --> 32:04.393
- Good-night.
- Good-night.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.707
Night!

32:10.954 --> 32:13.084
This reminds me of
when we first met.

32:13.084 --> 32:15.752
We used to talk on the phone for hours.

32:15.777 --> 32:17.384
<i>I know, right?</i>

32:17.877 --> 32:20.073
You know, one time I...

32:20.277 --> 32:23.129
I left my buddy's house at half-time
just so I could call you.

32:23.129 --> 32:26.393
- No, you didn't!
- Yes, of course!

32:26.648 --> 32:29.139
I wanted to play with him just right.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.851
Alone time.

32:50.999 --> 32:53.964
Ah, you'll leave here
to come home on Tuesday.

32:54.003 --> 32:56.565
I miss falling asleep with you.

33:11.838 --> 33:14.964
Could I interest you in coming
with me to Bellson Gardens?

33:15.112 --> 33:16.630
Sounds boring.

33:16.630 --> 33:18.631
The forests are beautiful.

33:18.656 --> 33:20.933
Living laboratory?
Historical landmark?

33:20.958 --> 33:22.724
Plants and trees all around?

33:22.724 --> 33:26.112
- Top of the line, I've been reading...
- I have to work, so... have fun.

33:50.466 --> 33:53.142
Screw you!

33:54.679 --> 33:58.807
Oh, I can't say that,
OK, hmmm...

34:06.187 --> 34:13.766
Thank you, but the room is taken.

34:23.782 --> 34:27.239
Oh, Miranda!
What are you doing in here?

34:27.264 --> 34:28.936
Karen told us
to stay out of the den.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.579
Yeah, well, she said that
I could use her computer

34:31.579 --> 34:34.433
because my laptop is broken.

34:35.668 --> 34:37.210
Everything OK?

34:37.210 --> 34:41.385
I got half-way to the bus stop, I realized
that I forgot my tele-folder lens.

34:41.935 --> 34:43.876
I'll just go up and get it.

34:53.931 --> 34:56.036
Doesn't look broken.

35:07.816 --> 35:09.408
You know what?

35:09.408 --> 35:10.850
I changed my mind.

35:10.850 --> 35:12.843
Let's go to that Garden thingy.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.002
I thought you had to work.

35:15.165 --> 35:16.850
I'll call in sick.

35:16.850 --> 35:18.171
I'm not sure it's
really your thing.

35:18.171 --> 35:22.800
I don't know. Come on! Who doesn't wanna
see trees and... plants? Let's go!

35:28.573 --> 35:31.125
I've never been to an... an Ar...

35:31.169 --> 35:34.002
A bar... what do you call it again?

35:34.126 --> 35:36.315
- Arboretum.
- Arboretum, yes.

35:36.315 --> 35:38.148
Arboretum.
I could never pronounce that word.

35:38.148 --> 35:39.797
It's right up here.

35:39.797 --> 35:41.424
Great.

35:47.537 --> 35:50.575
It's so peaceful and
no one else is around.

36:02.254 --> 36:06.193
That's neat. Looks like Holly.
It's not.

36:06.791 --> 36:08.258
Great.

36:35.732 --> 36:37.889
That's what you get
for being so annoying.

36:37.889 --> 36:40.617
Crusty old waste of oxygen.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.641
Maybe in your next life you'll learn
to mind your own business, huh?

36:54.315 --> 36:55.900
Good chap.

37:51.223 --> 37:54.294
Hey, I thought I heard you in here.

37:54.454 --> 37:56.149
How was work?

37:56.174 --> 37:59.402
- Did you talk to Evander today?
- Not really.

37:59.432 --> 38:02.733
I tried to say good-bye to him before
I left for work but he didn't respond.

38:02.758 --> 38:05.583
- He kind of seemed cranky.
- Did he? About what?

38:07.845 --> 38:11.620
He left three days early
and gave me a horrible review.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.318
What?

38:15.659 --> 38:20.453
HOSTESS RUDE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
DON'T STAY HERE.

38:20.725 --> 38:22.127
What an ass!

38:22.127 --> 38:25.812
I don't understand. He was completely
happy with his room this morning.

38:27.508 --> 38:30.758
- Did you try calling him?
- Yeah, but there was no answer.

38:30.941 --> 38:33.230
He was kind of weird, anyway.

38:33.230 --> 38:35.190
- Was he?
- Mhm-hm.

38:36.087 --> 38:39.055
Well, now I have a bad review
and I don't even know what I did wrong.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.630
You know what?
Don't worry about the review.

38:40.630 --> 38:44.301
I will log on tonight
and I will give you a glowing review.

38:44.301 --> 38:46.593
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:46.675 --> 38:48.850
You look like you could
use a glass of wine.

38:48.850 --> 38:50.819
- I could.
- OK.

38:52.988 --> 38:55.598
So what about your Dad?
Were you close to him?

38:55.623 --> 38:58.283
I don't think anyone was close to my Dad.
Not even him.

38:58.308 --> 38:59.737
Really?

38:59.978 --> 39:02.421
He was in the Marines,
so he was deployed a lot.

39:02.421 --> 39:04.719
So when he was home,
things were really tense.

39:04.719 --> 39:06.652
I preferred it when he was gone.

39:07.242 --> 39:08.725
What about you?

39:10.990 --> 39:12.903
I was...

39:12.903 --> 39:14.549
I was adopted...

39:14.549 --> 39:16.560
when I was five.

39:16.612 --> 39:20.688
And then before that, I basically bounced
around from foster home to foster home.

39:22.091 --> 39:24.244
Something happened with your parents?

39:24.269 --> 39:26.202
Yeah, erm...

39:26.657 --> 39:29.160
They were both married to other people.

39:29.295 --> 39:33.194
And then, the adoption records
were sealed until...

39:33.497 --> 39:35.536
the laws changed.

39:36.254 --> 39:38.263
Did you find them?

39:38.477 --> 39:39.945
Yeah.

39:40.611 --> 39:43.760
Neither one of them wanted to
have anything to do with me.

39:43.828 --> 39:45.837
I can't imagine that.

39:46.655 --> 39:49.881
Having a kid, knowing they're out there
and not wanting to meet them.

39:49.881 --> 39:52.080
At least once,
you know...

39:52.193 --> 39:54.897
I mean, I understand,
you know?

39:54.897 --> 39:57.910
I would have interrupted their lives.

39:58.581 --> 40:00.304
Anyways,
it was really hard

40:00.304 --> 40:02.957
but I think what was worse
was just not knowing about my siblings.

40:02.957 --> 40:05.712
It was, like, all my friends had sisters
they could share clothes with,

40:05.712 --> 40:08.675
they had brothers they could,
like, play pranks on them.

40:08.817 --> 40:12.377
And growing up, I had...
nobody.

40:13.027 --> 40:16.020
- Yeah, I always wanted a sister too.
- Really?

40:16.020 --> 40:18.845
I think that's why Aubrey and I got along
so well, because we both wanted it.

40:18.845 --> 40:21.490
So, we kind of became
each other's sisters.

40:21.515 --> 40:24.431
Yeah, yeah, I like her.

40:24.456 --> 40:27.099
- She's a good chick.
- She's a trip.

40:28.069 --> 40:30.874
She always has a crisis going on,
it drives Andrew crazy.

40:30.874 --> 40:32.797
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:44.475 --> 40:47.486
This is good,
this is really good.

40:50.844 --> 40:53.027
I'm so glad to be home.

40:53.191 --> 40:55.620
I'm so glad to have you home.

40:57.174 --> 40:59.326
I'm gonna go make some food.

40:59.351 --> 41:00.462
OK.

41:17.734 --> 41:19.987
All right, the steaks are close.

41:20.135 --> 41:21.696
Can't wait!

41:22.386 --> 41:25.697
- Oh, Miranda, hey!
- Hey, guys!

41:25.961 --> 41:27.837
Smells good.
What you got cooking?

41:27.837 --> 41:30.406
We got some Nebraska grass-pepper rice.
Are you hungry?

41:30.406 --> 41:32.670
- Starving! - I bought an extra
one. Do you want a beer?

41:32.670 --> 41:34.549
- Sure.
- I got it!

41:34.549 --> 41:37.416
So, you must really know
your way around the kitchen.

41:37.463 --> 41:39.160
Are you kidding me?
I'm a master.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.089
- Right, brother? Tell her. He knows.
- Master.

41:41.089 --> 41:43.361
Don't believe a word this guys says.

41:44.876 --> 41:47.445
Wow, I think that's gonna
have to be it for me, guys.

41:47.445 --> 41:49.969
No, it's not the company, is it ?

41:49.969 --> 41:50.937
Yep!

41:51.922 --> 41:56.049
No, no, it's the medication.

41:56.207 --> 41:58.015
Or whatever, bro,
you're just getting old.

42:02.299 --> 42:04.510
- Good-night.
- Good-night.

42:04.535 --> 42:07.453
- Thanks for dinner, bro.
- No problem.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.190
This was really good.

42:09.190 --> 42:11.765
- Yeah? You liked it.
- I'd say you are a master.

42:11.765 --> 42:13.564
- I've a chance.
- You won that title.

42:15.831 --> 42:17.769
Anyway, how about a little desert?

42:18.353 --> 42:20.385
What's the matter?
I thought you liked her.

42:20.385 --> 42:21.775
I do.

42:22.188 --> 42:24.448
I don't know.
She's been here for a week

42:24.448 --> 42:26.781
and she's acting like
she wants to marry him.

42:26.856 --> 42:29.126
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

42:29.936 --> 42:31.459
Why are you so stressed?

42:31.459 --> 42:34.024
I guess that whole Evander
thing is still getting to me.

42:34.024 --> 42:36.808
I still don't have the
other room rented out.

42:37.551 --> 42:38.866
Yeah, well...

42:39.522 --> 42:42.990
You know, I don't know what
the deal with the other guys is.

42:43.062 --> 42:44.563
You know,
it's cruel.

42:44.563 --> 42:47.550
Can't please everybody, right?
You just gotta let it go.

42:47.711 --> 42:49.956
I guess some things we
will never know, right?

42:49.956 --> 42:52.230
- I guess.
- Yeah.

42:52.604 --> 42:56.511
Hey, at least Miranda is paying for
an extra week. That's good, right?

42:56.511 --> 42:58.461
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:02.689 --> 43:04.879
She's gonna love it.

43:13.907 --> 43:16.329
- Hello?
- Hey, Miranda, it's Tyler.

43:16.329 --> 43:18.187
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

43:18.187 --> 43:20.606
Listen, I was wondering
if you wanted to, maybe,

43:20.606 --> 43:22.741
go out with me some time,
maybe for drinks or something?

43:22.741 --> 43:24.604
I'd... sure!

43:24.629 --> 43:26.312
How about Thursday?

43:26.443 --> 43:28.631
Yeah. Thursday sounds good.

43:28.656 --> 43:29.709
Cool. Pick you up at nine?

43:29.709 --> 43:31.200
OK. Looking forward to it.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.879
- Great. Me too.
- All right.

43:32.904 --> 43:33.904
Bye.

43:41.691 --> 43:42.755
Oh!

43:44.003 --> 43:46.046
Hold on a sec.
It's Aubrey.

43:46.071 --> 43:48.847
- Hello?
- What are you doing right now?

43:48.847 --> 43:50.564
I'm just going for lunch.

43:50.564 --> 43:51.979
You're OK?
You sound upset.

43:51.979 --> 43:54.517
Gary broke up with me... in a text.

43:54.517 --> 43:56.715
I tried calling but he won't answer.

43:56.740 --> 43:58.430
Where are you?
Are you at work?

43:58.430 --> 44:01.354
- I walked out.
- You walked out? Aubrey!

44:01.354 --> 44:03.850
I wanna go to his house
and demand he talk to me.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.682
No, no, no...
don't do that.

44:05.943 --> 44:08.849
- Can't you just come and pick me up?
- Just a sec.

44:09.517 --> 44:11.185
Would you kill me if I bailed on lunch?

44:11.185 --> 44:13.279
I should go talk to Aubrey.
She's gonna lose her job.

44:13.279 --> 44:15.272
Her boyfriend broke up with her.

44:15.744 --> 44:17.369
Of course.

44:18.330 --> 44:19.773
Thanks.

44:20.380 --> 44:22.687
Someone should send Aubrey to hell!

44:26.588 --> 44:28.759
It's not that I don't like Miranda.

44:28.759 --> 44:32.016
It's just she's always so
desperate for my attention.

44:32.156 --> 44:34.671
It's like she really needs
a friend or something.

44:34.671 --> 44:36.883
Hmm. Maybe she doesn't have any friends.

44:36.916 --> 44:38.594
Did you look her up on Facebook?

44:38.594 --> 44:39.865
Her profile is private.

44:39.865 --> 44:42.650
I can only see her main picture
and her cover photo.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.250
Oh, by the way,

44:44.250 --> 44:46.415
that watch you asked me
to order in for Tyler,

44:46.415 --> 44:49.023
it isn't in yet.
Probably this afternoon.

44:49.245 --> 44:51.635
I'll bring it over tomorrow
and leave it with your hubby.

44:51.635 --> 44:53.263
Right, I still owe you for that.

44:53.288 --> 44:56.424
Thanks for getting us a discount.
Saved us a lot of money.

45:06.923 --> 45:09.731
Miranda, where are you off to?

45:09.731 --> 45:11.679
Running a little late for work?

45:52.331 --> 45:55.606
Trainer at the Daxon, my ass!

46:17.852 --> 46:20.879
Hey, I think that girl is
taking pictures of here.

46:23.549 --> 46:25.105
Oh, my God.

46:25.105 --> 46:26.675
Aubrey!

46:26.749 --> 46:28.208
What are you doing here?

46:28.208 --> 46:29.563
It's a nice place.

46:29.563 --> 46:31.570
Not as nice as the Daxon.

46:31.612 --> 46:33.630
You stupid bitch.

46:33.630 --> 46:35.783
- Delete those photos right now.
- No! - Give me the phone!

46:35.783 --> 46:38.332
No! Karen deserves to
know what a liar you are.

46:38.491 --> 46:39.821
- Miranda, stop!
. No!

46:39.821 --> 46:41.210
Give me the phone. You're
not showing her anything.

46:41.210 --> 46:42.483
What the hell is going on?

46:42.508 --> 46:45.288
- She assaulted me.
- She's taking pictures. - Stop it!

46:45.348 --> 46:47.099
- Stop it. -Aubrey, give me the phone.
- Let it go.

46:47.099 --> 46:50.921
- Let it go.
- You don't understand. - Let it go.

47:08.527 --> 47:10.859
Hey, it's Karen. Leave me a message.

47:10.859 --> 47:16.300
Karen, it's Miranda. Can you call
me as soon as you get this message?

47:16.433 --> 47:20.176
There's something that
I need to explain to you.

47:40.016 --> 47:42.526
What the hell?

47:50.389 --> 47:52.154
You attacked Aubrey.

47:52.154 --> 47:56.012
I didn't attack Aubrey. I just wanted
to delete the photos off her phone.

47:56.012 --> 47:58.396
- Why did you lie to me about your job?
- No, I...

47:58.396 --> 48:02.043
I was trying to explain it at lunch
yesterday but stupid-ass Aubrey ruined it.

48:02.043 --> 48:04.512
Whoa! She's my friend.
Do not talk about her like that.

48:04.512 --> 48:06.717
Yeah, well, she's a conniving bitch
and she's out to get me.

48:06.717 --> 48:07.814
Miranda!

48:08.119 --> 48:09.959
I'm sorry.

48:10.342 --> 48:14.078
Listen, there's a lot of things
that I need to explain to you.

48:14.222 --> 48:16.417
And I wanted to tell you earlier,

48:16.875 --> 48:19.851
but I was afraid it was going
to affect our relationship.

48:20.303 --> 48:22.640
Re- relationship?

48:22.917 --> 48:25.372
She's a host and you're
a guest renting a room.

48:25.372 --> 48:26.951
That's pretty much how that goes.

48:26.951 --> 48:29.216
- No, we're a lot more than that.
- No, we aren't.

48:29.216 --> 48:31.269
Miranda, you've
been a great guest

48:31.269 --> 48:33.531
but somewhere along the
way this is gotten weird.

48:33.531 --> 48:35.831
And I don't know where,
but it's gotten crazy.

48:36.018 --> 48:37.661
- I think that you need to find

48:37.661 --> 48:39.040
- somewhere else to stay.
- No!

48:39.065 --> 48:40.350
Wait. OK, I'm sorry

48:40.350 --> 48:42.315
about what happened with
Aubrey but it's her.

48:42.351 --> 48:44.952
It wasn't me.
She's jealous of me.

48:44.952 --> 48:47.416
She sees how close you and I are
getting and she wants that.

48:47.416 --> 48:49.423
- She's really scared of it.
- Please stop.

48:49.634 --> 48:53.496
Andrew and I have way too much going
on right now and we can't handle this.

48:53.519 --> 48:56.357
- It's time for you to find
somewhere else to stay. - Wait!

49:07.875 --> 49:09.231
Read it.

49:09.391 --> 49:10.557
What is this?

49:10.557 --> 49:11.745
It's a birth certificate.

49:11.745 --> 49:13.649
Look at the name of the mother.

49:14.559 --> 49:16.444
Nancy Holliston.

49:16.841 --> 49:18.788
That's my mother's name.

49:20.406 --> 49:21.406
Yeah.

49:23.005 --> 49:24.993
I'm your sister, Karen.

49:27.446 --> 49:29.575
That's not possible.

49:30.889 --> 49:34.240
Our mother had an affair with my father.

49:34.843 --> 49:36.878
When your father was deployed.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.045
And when your Dad came back,

49:39.045 --> 49:42.052
and found out that she was pregnant.
It was too late to get an abortion.

49:44.076 --> 49:46.984
And so, he told her that
if she didn't get rid of me,

49:47.816 --> 49:51.191
he would take you and leave,
so, she did.

49:52.460 --> 49:54.506
That's according to my father.

49:58.178 --> 49:59.980
Wow, hmmm...

50:01.137 --> 50:02.846
Did you...

50:03.501 --> 50:05.365
meet her?

50:08.969 --> 50:10.260
No.

50:12.025 --> 50:15.393
When the adoption records opened,
I raced down there...

50:15.393 --> 50:18.054
and I found out who she was...

50:18.200 --> 50:21.964
I looked her up
and I wrote her a letter telling her...

50:22.053 --> 50:24.577
who I was and we were gonna meet,

50:24.981 --> 50:27.772
when she got back from Mexico but...

50:29.269 --> 50:31.418
Obviously, she passed away.

50:32.630 --> 50:35.346
OK, so let me get this straight.

50:35.452 --> 50:37.402
You, erm...

50:38.055 --> 50:41.007
You came here pretending
to be a stranger to rent a room,

50:41.007 --> 50:43.352
I didn't wanna lie to you guys,
I just...

50:43.798 --> 50:45.786
I didn't know what else to do.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.801
OK, after everything that
happened with our mother and...

50:48.801 --> 50:50.361
my father wanting...

50:53.562 --> 50:56.504
My father wanting nothing to do with me.

50:58.426 --> 51:00.192
Hmm.

51:02.293 --> 51:03.657
It just...

51:03.657 --> 51:05.987
I don't know if I should tell you.

51:07.108 --> 51:08.507
Because I thought...

51:08.507 --> 51:10.879
you were gonna reject me.

51:16.327 --> 51:17.856
I - I can't do this.

51:17.856 --> 51:21.662
No, Karen, I'm sorry.
I don't wanna hurt you.

51:22.946 --> 51:25.715
I'm sorry. I just need...
I need some time.

51:25.740 --> 51:29.160
Karen! Wait, wait! God!

51:29.160 --> 51:31.261
I should've told her the truth.
I should've told her who I was.

51:31.261 --> 51:33.359
Yeah, you should have.

51:33.835 --> 51:36.733
Look, just give her some space, OK?

51:36.800 --> 51:38.730
I just wanted a chance.

51:41.726 --> 51:45.431
Wow! Miranda,
this is so beautiful. Thank you.

51:45.431 --> 51:48.163
They match.
You can put them together and...

51:48.163 --> 51:50.691
and they're like a heart and they match.

51:51.528 --> 51:54.490
I - I'm so sorry I lied to you.

51:54.561 --> 51:56.489
Again, I just...

51:58.676 --> 52:01.203
I wanted to be truthful
from the beginning but...

52:01.203 --> 52:04.139
I was so afraid that you were
just gonna tell me "Get lost".

52:04.231 --> 52:05.716
And...

52:06.684 --> 52:10.567
You have no idea how bad
I have wanted a sister, like...

52:11.407 --> 52:12.860
my whole life.

52:13.263 --> 52:16.432
And then, when I found out
that you existed, I just...

52:16.572 --> 52:19.034
I - I - just...
 I didn't want to screw it up.

52:19.059 --> 52:22.102
So, I hope I haven't, have I?
Screwed it up?

52:22.641 --> 52:24.835
I think this is just...

52:25.464 --> 52:27.605
really difficult for everyone.

52:29.456 --> 52:30.963
Erm, I...

52:31.221 --> 52:34.261
I thought that you may want to see
some photos of our mother.

52:34.286 --> 52:36.718
Since you never got a chance
to meet her in person.

52:36.720 --> 52:40.090
Can I ask you how... she died?

52:41.658 --> 52:44.672
- She committed suicide.
- What?

52:45.313 --> 52:47.517
She'd been having stomach pains.

52:47.517 --> 52:49.528
So, I took her to the doctor,

52:49.528 --> 52:51.757
this was in February,
and they...

52:51.757 --> 52:55.578
ran a bunch of tests and they found
that she had stomach cancer.

52:55.696 --> 52:58.926
But her prognosis was good.
She was in the early stages.

52:59.705 --> 53:02.802
They wanted to start chemo
but she decided to go to Mexico

53:02.802 --> 53:05.945
for a week before
staring treatment...

53:06.165 --> 53:09.843
Just to relax and prepare herself.

53:10.732 --> 53:12.599
And then, erm...

53:14.553 --> 53:18.139
Four days after she got there,
 I got a call from...

53:18.672 --> 53:21.273
the police in Mexico, that...

53:22.839 --> 53:25.141
That she had hanged herself in her room.

53:25.141 --> 53:26.657
Oh, my God.

53:26.657 --> 53:29.678
She had left a note
for me on her tablet...

53:29.703 --> 53:31.741
But never sent it.

53:32.116 --> 53:35.162
And I didn't see it until I got there.

53:35.530 --> 53:37.514
Oh, my God.

53:38.094 --> 53:39.722
Did she...?

53:40.119 --> 53:42.237
Did she mention me in the note?

53:44.094 --> 53:45.910
No, not at all.

53:46.895 --> 53:49.024
She just said that she...

53:49.052 --> 53:51.175
that she didn't wanna suffer...

53:51.407 --> 53:54.275
through something that
she didn't think she could survive.

53:54.810 --> 53:58.911
And that she had a beautiful
last couple of days and...

53:59.220 --> 54:01.460
was where she wished.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.098
Sorry, I don't know who this is.

54:08.793 --> 54:10.302
Hello?

54:10.493 --> 54:12.891
<i>Hi, is this Karen Hexley?</i>

54:13.030 --> 54:14.106
Yes, it is.

54:14.106 --> 54:15.853
My name is Emily Swanson.

54:15.853 --> 54:19.955
I believe my grandfather, Evander Swanson,
was staying at your house?

54:20.011 --> 54:21.298
Yes, he was.

54:21.298 --> 54:24.447
<i>I saw the review he wrote on you
on Vacay N' Stay,</i>

54:24.447 --> 54:27.812
and my grandfather's never written
a bad review in his life.

54:28.222 --> 54:30.374
- What happened?
- I don't know.

54:30.505 --> 54:34.200
Everything seemed fine and then,
when I got back from work, he was gone.

54:34.225 --> 54:35.458
<i>Well...</i>

54:35.575 --> 54:37.294
<i>He's missing.</i>

54:37.950 --> 54:41.377
<i>No one's talked to him since the day
that he posted that review.</i>

54:41.377 --> 54:44.485
He hasn't used his credit cards
or answered his cellphone...

54:44.485 --> 54:45.914
Oh, my God!

54:46.685 --> 54:50.510
- Evander's grand-daughter.
They can't find him. - Oh, my God!

54:50.510 --> 54:52.447
<i>I'm going to file
a missing person's report.</i>

54:52.447 --> 54:54.718
The police will probably contact you.

54:54.718 --> 54:58.172
Of course, anything I can do to help,
please, give them my number.

54:58.250 --> 55:01.020
<i>Thank you... so much.</i>

55:01.020 --> 55:04.166
Thank you. Please, keep me informed.

55:05.458 --> 55:07.013
So weird.

55:07.013 --> 55:09.066
Man, I hope he's OK.

55:09.066 --> 55:10.648
Me too.

55:15.462 --> 55:17.824
You're the only real family that...

55:17.824 --> 55:19.428
I have.

55:19.428 --> 55:21.353
- And...
- I...

55:21.754 --> 55:24.421
I want to continue to get to know you.

55:25.200 --> 55:28.256
But I wanna do it the right way...
Slowly.

55:29.396 --> 55:30.545
OK.

55:30.545 --> 55:33.349
I think you need
to find a place to live.

55:33.446 --> 55:35.374
And then, you and I can...

55:35.374 --> 55:37.305
You know, build a relationship slowly,

55:37.305 --> 55:40.054
get to know each other,
as sisters, and...

55:40.261 --> 55:43.168
- Have dinners and barbecues and...
- So...

55:43.460 --> 55:45.460
Don't stay with you.

55:46.745 --> 55:49.335
it's just too much too soon.

55:49.335 --> 55:52.557
I wanna get to know you as a sister,
not as a room-mate.

55:53.665 --> 55:56.163
I'm not gonna make you leave tomorrow.

55:56.163 --> 55:58.180
I hope you find a place near us.

55:58.180 --> 56:00.006
So, when are you kicking me out? Huh?

56:00.031 --> 56:01.845
I'm not kicking you out.

56:02.208 --> 56:03.880
I'm trying to figure out this situation.

56:03.880 --> 56:06.034
When I leave, someone else
is going to rent the room,

56:06.034 --> 56:08.359
I mean, isn't it better to
rent it to your own sister

56:08.359 --> 56:09.820
than just some stranger?

56:09.820 --> 56:12.025
Staying with Andrew and I
is not an option.

56:12.644 --> 56:14.051
Not yet.

56:15.187 --> 56:19.852
I'm sorry, I know, you're right,
I'm sorry, I need to respect...

56:20.254 --> 56:22.070
the way that
you wanna do this,

56:22.070 --> 56:25.514
so, and I do...
I respect it, so...

56:26.345 --> 56:28.957
You know what?
I'm gonna find a place in Philly,

56:28.957 --> 56:32.079
and we'll go to weekly lunches.

56:32.079 --> 56:35.656
And then, we're just...
We'll see how it goes.

56:37.588 --> 56:38.964
Thank you.

56:39.596 --> 56:41.502
You're my sister.

56:41.902 --> 56:46.190
And I love you and I just... I really -
I really want you to be happy.

56:53.290 --> 56:55.288
OK, it has brand-new paint,

56:55.288 --> 56:57.501
and a brand-new stove.

56:57.914 --> 57:00.119
Wow, yeah, this is great.

57:00.342 --> 57:01.938
- I'll take it.
- Excellent!

57:01.938 --> 57:04.472
So, I'll need you to fill this out
and give it back to me,

57:04.472 --> 57:06.431
I'll need three month's pay-stops,

57:06.431 --> 57:09.436
last year's history of tax-returns,
a thousand dollar's deposit,

57:09.436 --> 57:12.625
and 25 dollars for the credit
and background check.

57:15.078 --> 57:16.274
OK.

57:44.453 --> 57:46.803
Hi, Officer.
How are you?

57:46.803 --> 57:48.665
License and registration.

57:48.891 --> 57:50.853
Right, hmm...

57:50.899 --> 57:54.794
I'm from out of town
so I was probably driving around.

57:55.059 --> 57:59.192
Not paying attention to the speed-limit,
since I'm a little lost, so, sorry.

57:59.648 --> 58:02.045
- Registration.
- Right.

58:02.211 --> 58:04.369
Erm... It's a rental car,

58:04.369 --> 58:07.289
so I have my rental agreement,
right there...

58:21.104 --> 58:22.805
Can you please step out of vehicle?

58:22.805 --> 58:24.730
What? I didn't do anything.

58:24.730 --> 58:27.314
The rental car you're driving
was reported stolen by the company.

58:27.314 --> 58:29.867
Oh, no, Officer,
I was gonna return this.

58:29.867 --> 58:31.837
I was gonna return
this car last week.

58:31.837 --> 58:34.344
I told them this must be
a mistake on their part.

58:34.344 --> 58:35.711
I'll let you take that up
with the company.

58:35.711 --> 58:38.830
No! This car is not stolen.
This is so ridiculous.

58:40.801 --> 58:42.084
Hey!

58:51.879 --> 58:54.530
- Hello!
- Hey, it's Miranda. I'm in jail.

58:54.530 --> 58:56.909
Jail? What?

58:58.753 --> 59:00.056
Karen?

59:00.328 --> 59:01.886
Hey, Nick!

59:01.886 --> 59:03.080
What are
you doing here?

59:03.080 --> 59:06.175
I'm bailing out my sister.

59:06.340 --> 59:08.532
Hmm, what about you?
Did you make detective?

59:08.532 --> 59:09.564
Mhm-hm.

59:09.564 --> 59:12.560
- Congratulations!
- Thanks! I gotta go.

59:12.560 --> 59:15.754
- We should do lunch soon. - Abso...
- Good to see you. - You too.

59:17.295 --> 59:20.391
Her personal items were
collected from the car.

59:20.416 --> 59:21.491
Thanks.

59:33.645 --> 59:34.936
What?

59:37.724 --> 59:39.282
What's this?

59:39.483 --> 59:41.514
You used my name,

59:41.514 --> 59:43.715
- to rent an apartment?
- What?

59:43.856 --> 59:45.225
Where did you get that?

59:45.225 --> 59:46.782
- Did you go through my purse?
- No!

59:46.782 --> 59:50.808
They retrieved it from the stolen car
before they sent it to the impound.

59:51.268 --> 59:53.628
- I can't believe this.
- No, it's not what you think.

59:53.628 --> 59:54.983
I was using you as a reference,

59:54.983 --> 59:57.413
I'm sure I just put your information
down in the wrong spot.

59:57.413 --> 01:00:00.935
And where's your information, Miranda?
Because I don't see your name...

01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:02.573
anywhere on this application.

01:00:02.573 --> 01:00:04.746
I'm telling you,
it's a simple mistake, Karen.

01:00:04.746 --> 01:00:07.085
I'm doing everything that you wanted,
I'm finding a place to live.

01:00:07.085 --> 01:00:08.439
I can't do this anymore.

01:00:08.464 --> 01:00:12.488
You lied, you stole my identity,
and now, I'm done.

01:00:12.488 --> 01:00:15.024
- It's time for you to go.
- No, Karen.

01:00:15.024 --> 01:00:17.105
No, you don't know
what you're saying, OK?

01:00:17.105 --> 01:00:19.177
I'm getting an apartment.
We're gonna do things,

01:00:19.177 --> 01:00:20.977
- Things the way that you wanted,
we're gonna go slow... - No, no, no...

01:00:20.977 --> 01:00:23.705
You're all that I have.
You're all that I have!

01:00:23.705 --> 01:00:25.283
We're one!

01:00:26.493 --> 01:00:29.834
She asked you to leave, Miranda,
now, I need you to go. You have to go!

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.581
- Andrew!
- She told you to leave! - No!

01:00:32.581 --> 01:00:34.272
Karen!

01:01:18.527 --> 01:01:21.402
- Hey!
- Tyler, hey, it's Miranda.

01:01:21.652 --> 01:01:23.805
I was just wondering.
Are we still on for later?

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.117
Yeah, totally.

01:01:25.117 --> 01:01:28.618
Great! I'm still at work so,
can I just meet you over there?

01:01:28.694 --> 01:01:31.651
Yeah, sure! I'll text you
the address in a bit.

01:01:31.637 --> 01:01:34.234
Perfect! Great, I'll see you in a bit.

01:01:34.234 --> 01:01:36.136
<i>OK, cool, see you soon.</i>

01:02:00.358 --> 01:02:02.609
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:02.609 --> 01:02:05.162
Sorry I'm late, the traffic was awful.

01:02:05.162 --> 01:02:07.815
Oh, no problem. I did get
ahead of you, though...

01:02:07.815 --> 01:02:10.685
Don't worry about it. I'll catch up.
Can I get you another one?

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:13.671
- Sure. Cosmo.
- OK, coming right up.

01:02:14.686 --> 01:02:17.972
I¡ll grab a Cosmo and a Gold Flash.

01:02:35.124 --> 01:02:37.268
Hi! Are you Karen Hexley?

01:02:37.426 --> 01:02:40.372
- Yes.
- I'm Detective Hannah Voda, Homicide.

01:02:40.372 --> 01:02:42.508
I'd like to talk to you
about Evander Swanson.

01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:43.914
Homicide?

01:02:43.914 --> 01:02:46.492
Groundskeeper found his body
today in Bellson Gardens.

01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:48.408
Oh, my God!

01:02:49.503 --> 01:02:52.626
Then I said, if you think we're going
out on a second date, you're crazy.

01:02:52.626 --> 01:02:53.838
- No!
- No, seriously.

01:02:53.838 --> 01:02:56.208
- No, you didn't say that.
- Yeah, and then I stuck her with the bill.

01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:59.297
Oh, my God.

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:01.727
I like a guy with sense of humor.

01:03:02.593 --> 01:03:06.398
So, did you tell Karen and Andrew
that we were going out tonight?

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:09.618
No, no, I don't really
like to share my...

01:03:09.708 --> 01:03:10.896
personal stuff.

01:03:10.896 --> 01:03:12.786
I mean, they're great,
you know, I mean,

01:03:12.786 --> 01:03:15.182
getting to know Andrew was great,
and Karen, I mean, we just...

01:03:15.182 --> 01:03:16.241
clicked right away.

01:03:16.241 --> 01:03:17.970
- Karen's the best.
- Yeah.

01:03:18.048 --> 01:03:19.685
And I'm sure they're
enjoying their privacy,

01:03:19.685 --> 01:03:21.176
at least until we get...

01:03:21.247 --> 01:03:24.462
kicked out of this bar, which...
I think might be soon.

01:03:24.462 --> 01:03:27.069
I didn't know this
bar closes so early.

01:03:27.982 --> 01:03:31.415
We can hit up another bar if you want,
or I don't know...

01:03:32.092 --> 01:03:34.745
go back to my place for a drink?

01:03:34.835 --> 01:03:35.956
Yeah.

01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:38.190
I mean, for Karen
and Andrew, of course.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:39.660
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:42.746
So, your sister Miranda was
the last one to see him.

01:03:42.746 --> 01:03:44.773
Half sister.

01:03:45.093 --> 01:03:46.294
Yes.

01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.822
And where is she?

01:03:47.922 --> 01:03:50.088
We had an argument
and I asked her to leave.

01:03:50.088 --> 01:03:52.622
And you got no idea
where she might have gone?

01:03:53.959 --> 01:03:56.772
Maybe the strip club?

01:03:56.772 --> 01:03:59.897
She worked at a strip club
but she got fired.

01:04:00.158 --> 01:04:02.023
Maybe someone there would know?

01:04:02.086 --> 01:04:03.743
What's the name?

01:04:05.103 --> 01:04:06.702
Red or white?

01:04:06.782 --> 01:04:08.589
Erm... red.

01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:11.205
I'll just give this a quick rinse.

01:04:13.256 --> 01:04:18.256
And I got a beautiful Parole up,
I'll be back in one. One second, OK?

01:04:18.256 --> 01:04:19.613
OK.

01:04:50.626 --> 01:04:53.235
This is from a region in
Italy called Piedmont...

01:04:53.235 --> 01:04:56.688
I'm so, so sorry,
I accidentally...

01:04:56.688 --> 01:04:58.722
just knocked your
phone into the sink.

01:04:58.747 --> 01:05:00.770
- Oh.
- Ahm...

01:05:00.907 --> 01:05:03.191
But I wouldn't turn it on,
you'll ruin it...

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:06.023
Do you have like a bag of rice?

01:05:06.023 --> 01:05:10.224
- Miranda Bryers.
- Oh, Miranda?

01:05:10.224 --> 01:05:11.640
That girl is a mess.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.378
She missed her first day at work,
gets fired in her first week.

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:17.235
- Was she close with anyone?
- Yeah, JoJo.

01:05:17.521 --> 01:05:20.141
She's right over there.

01:05:22.872 --> 01:05:25.588
So, just like... leave it.
Just like that.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.519
I'm sorry.
It was so bad.

01:05:27.519 --> 01:05:29.634
Hey, let's not let it
ruin our night, OK?

01:05:29.662 --> 01:05:31.551
- OK.
- Right. Let's go have that wine.

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:36.226
Seriously?
You don't have a boyfriend?

01:05:36.444 --> 01:05:40.584
I would have thought a girl like you would
have wound up far back home in Oregon.

01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:43.317
- I did have a boyfriend
but it didn't work out. - No?

01:05:43.317 --> 01:05:45.443
- Mhm-hm. You?

01:05:45.697 --> 01:05:48.823
My last serious relationship
was about two years ago.

01:05:48.823 --> 01:05:51.331
Turned into a total nightmare.

01:05:51.854 --> 01:05:53.331
Yeah.

01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:55.519
I know what you mean.

01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:08.586
We'd only recently reconnected.

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:13.590
I didn't know when I got her the
job here that she was so unstable.

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:15.903
Did she eve mention
Evander Swanson?

01:06:15.903 --> 01:06:18.035
The other guest that's staying
with Karen and Andrew...

01:06:18.035 --> 01:06:19.416
Not to me.

01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:21.907
Have you any idea
where she might be right now?

01:06:21.907 --> 01:06:23.998
She mentioned meeting a guy.

01:06:23.998 --> 01:06:26.436
- But I don't remember his name.
- Mhm.

01:06:26.436 --> 01:06:27.941
Would you mind
giving her a call?

01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:30.208
Let her know that we just want
her to come down to the station,

01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:31.974
I just wanna speak with her.

01:06:31.974 --> 01:06:34.740
I doubt she'll pick up
but I'll try.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.900
<i>Belle's Choice Adoption Agency,
how can I help you?</i>

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:19.112
Hi, I'd like to speak to someone about
an adoption that happened 28 years ago.

01:07:26.403 --> 01:07:28.731
<i>You've reached Tyler.
Leave a message.</i>

01:07:28.731 --> 01:07:31.410
Hey, buddy, can you call me
as soon as you get this?

01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:35.757
It's just some crazy stuff going on with
Miranda I just gotta tell you about.

01:07:35.757 --> 01:07:39.209
So, you mean there's no birth
father ever recorded... anywhere?

01:07:39.234 --> 01:07:41.277
<i>No, we have no record of him at all.</i>

01:07:41.284 --> 01:07:43.976
- OK, thanks.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:47.764
Miranda lied.

01:07:47.843 --> 01:07:49.483
Again?

01:07:49.508 --> 01:07:51.559
What was it this time?

01:07:52.022 --> 01:07:55.725
She said that she found her birth father
and he rejected her.

01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:58.105
But the adoption agency
couldn't have told her that

01:07:58.105 --> 01:07:59.495
because they didn't
know about it.

01:07:59.495 --> 01:08:02.400
- You mean you Mum never out a father
on the birth certificate? - No.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.395
And the only way for her
to know who he was is from Mum.

01:08:05.431 --> 01:08:09.040
She said she didn't get a chance
to talk to her before she died.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.720
- Unless she lied about that too.
- When did the open these records?

01:08:13.797 --> 01:08:15.819
June 1st.

01:08:15.819 --> 01:08:18.117
Three weeks before Mom died.

01:08:20.804 --> 01:08:22.562
Who are you calling?

01:08:27.746 --> 01:08:29.395
Detective Shelby here.

01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:32.908
Hi, Nick. This is Karen Hexley calling.
How are you?

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:34.609
Hey, I couldn't be better.
What's up?

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.490
I was wondering if you could
help me with something.

01:08:36.515 --> 01:08:37.814
Sure!

01:08:37.944 --> 01:08:42.889
Do you have any contacts with the Police
Department in the Riviera Maya, Mexico?

01:08:43.188 --> 01:08:45.970
And if not, can you make
a phone call for me?

01:08:48.817 --> 01:08:50.444
Good morning.

01:08:51.705 --> 01:08:52.783
Hey.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.928
I made breakfast.

01:08:56.081 --> 01:08:58.048
- Oh, did you?
- Do you want it in bed?

01:08:58.048 --> 01:08:59.504
Yeah!

01:08:59.548 --> 01:09:02.111
I don’t think anyone's ever
really done that for me before.

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:06.658
Well, then you have been
dating the wrong kind of girls.

01:09:06.696 --> 01:09:08.278
Maybe I have.

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.020
I'll go get it.

01:09:16.831 --> 01:09:19.607
I didn't get anything from the police
down there but I did call the hotel

01:09:19.607 --> 01:09:21.651
where your Mum was staying.

01:09:26.886 --> 01:09:28.176
Is that Miranda?

01:09:28.176 --> 01:09:30.863
The manager told me six other
Americans were staying there

01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:32.697
the same time your Mum was.

01:09:32.697 --> 01:09:34.823
She wouldn't give me their
names for privacy reasons

01:09:34.823 --> 01:09:36.533
but she did give
me the area codes

01:09:36.533 --> 01:09:39.679
of the phone numbers they used
at the time of reservation.

01:09:40.973 --> 01:09:43.149
One of them was from Oregon.

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:46.038
That’s why I asked for a clip
of that person checking in.

01:09:47.028 --> 01:09:49.049
Oh, my God.

01:09:49.165 --> 01:09:52.032
I wish you didn't have
to go back to Oregon so soon.

01:09:52.032 --> 01:09:54.091
I could get used to this.

01:09:56.838 --> 01:09:59.427
I don't have to go back.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.890
No, it was, erm...

01:10:04.574 --> 01:10:06.714
kind of my plan the whole time.

01:10:06.714 --> 01:10:08.539
- To stay.
- Really?

01:10:08.539 --> 01:10:11.837
I was gonna let Karen
announce this, but I...

01:10:11.837 --> 01:10:13.954
I guess I should tell you.

01:10:13.954 --> 01:10:15.787
Tell me what?

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.788
Karen...

01:10:18.788 --> 01:10:21.950
is my half-sister.

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:24.525
We have the same Mum.

01:10:24.907 --> 01:10:30.036
I mean, the whole reason that I came out
here was to get to know her better.

01:10:30.061 --> 01:10:31.624
What?

01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.535
What? I mean...

01:10:34.535 --> 01:10:38.307
It was Karen's news to tell.
I thought that maybe... because,

01:10:38.307 --> 01:10:40.094
you and I were getting...

01:10:40.094 --> 01:10:42.153
so close, I - I thought I should...

01:10:42.153 --> 01:10:44.590
How long have you known this?

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.726
I - I just...

01:10:48.364 --> 01:10:50.501
I just told them yesterday,

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:53.113
and I get that
that was probably a mistake,

01:10:53.113 --> 01:10:56.672
but if I just walked up to Karen's door
and told her who I was,

01:10:56.672 --> 01:11:00.446
she would most likely reject me because
our Mum didn't even tell her who I was.

01:11:00.446 --> 01:11:03.953
You know...and she just, she needs time,
she just needs time,

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.894
to just come to terms with it.

01:11:07.786 --> 01:11:10.907
You know, because everything

01:11:10.907 --> 01:11:13.310
was fine before I told her

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.470
who I was.
We were getting along so great.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.579
Miranda, you know,
you really should've told me...

01:11:17.579 --> 01:11:19.248
before last night.

01:11:19.248 --> 01:11:22.465
Yeah. How...? How was I supposed to
tell you? How was I supposed to just...

01:11:22.465 --> 01:11:26.216
bring it up? How do you... How do you
want me to say something like that?

01:11:26.216 --> 01:11:29.569
Tyler, I like you. I like you a lot
and I know that you like me.

01:11:29.569 --> 01:11:32.886
I know that you like me and
we're gonna be one great family.

01:11:32.886 --> 01:11:35.899
I'm so happy to have
all of you in my life.

01:11:37.762 --> 01:11:39.885
- Hello?
- Tyler?

01:11:39.885 --> 01:11:43.405
Hey, man, why didn't you call me back?
I left you messages on your cell.

01:11:43.405 --> 01:11:46.132
My phone's kind of
out of commission right now, bro.

01:11:46.157 --> 01:11:50.187
OK, look... I gotta tell you
about what's going on with Miranda.

01:11:50.187 --> 01:11:53.371
Yeah, I know.
She's Karen's sister.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.195
- How did you know that?
- Because she's here right now.

01:11:56.195 --> 01:11:58.302
All right? She stayed
over last night.

01:11:58.302 --> 01:12:01.866
OK. All right, go somewhere
where she can't hear you.

01:12:01.866 --> 01:12:03.401
There's more to the story.

01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:06.400
- Go ahead.
- The cops are looking for her, man.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.131
They think she had something to do
with that guy, Evander's death.

01:12:09.131 --> 01:12:11.700
Evander?
Who's that?

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.583
The guy that was staying with us
and went missing.

01:12:14.583 --> 01:12:17.256
You gotta keep her there, OK?
I'm sending the cops over right now.

01:12:17.256 --> 01:12:18.073
The cops?

01:12:18.073 --> 01:12:21.138
- Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.
- She's bad news, pal.

01:12:21.138 --> 01:12:22.564
They're all against me.

01:12:22.564 --> 01:12:26.391
The found Evander's body
at the arboretum.

01:12:30.575 --> 01:12:32.561
Listen, just keep her there.
All right?

01:12:32.561 --> 01:12:33.652
I don't believe this.

01:12:33.652 --> 01:12:36.108
- OK, I'll try.
- OK.

01:12:36.724 --> 01:12:38.379
Tyler?

01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:41.375
Tyler?
Are you OK?

01:12:42.033 --> 01:12:44.458
If you look at the medical
examiner's drawings, the markings

01:12:44.458 --> 01:12:46.315
don't seem consistent
with hanging, do they?

01:12:46.315 --> 01:12:48.228
More like manual strangulation.

01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:50.347
That's my husband.

01:12:50.573 --> 01:12:52.346
- Hello?
- Karen?

01:12:52.346 --> 01:12:54.087
Miranda attacked Tyler.

01:12:54.087 --> 01:12:56.286
The police and the ambulance are
on the way to his place right now.

01:12:56.286 --> 01:12:58.941
Miranda just attacked my brother in law.

01:13:00.472 --> 01:13:02.131
- Dispatch?
- Dave!

01:13:02.131 --> 01:13:05.548
It's Detective Shelby. We got a lead
on Miranda Breyers. Hold on.

01:13:06.338 --> 01:13:08.033
D'you see this?

01:13:08.033 --> 01:13:11.642
There were no fingerprints
found on the victim's tablet... at all.

01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:13.282
What does that mean?

01:13:14.084 --> 01:13:15.890
Someone wiped them?

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:19.423
It's something we see when people
try to fake a suicide note.

01:13:20.618 --> 01:13:22.933
What are you saying?

01:13:23.272 --> 01:13:26.760
Are you saying my Mum
didn't commit suicide?

01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:30.674
Do you think that Miranda
killed my mother?

01:13:31.414 --> 01:13:33.667
Oh, my God!

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:44.713
The ambulance just arrived
and they said that Tyler was coherent.

01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:46.954
Oh, thank God!

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.608
Do you think she'll go back to
the house? Andrew's there alone.

01:13:51.608 --> 01:13:53.681
I'll get a car over there now.

01:14:41.772 --> 01:14:43.976
Hold on.
I'm coming!

01:14:48.481 --> 01:14:50.366
- Hey. Andrew?
- Yes.

01:14:50.366 --> 01:14:52.881
- Everything OK in here?
- Yes, Officer.

01:14:52.881 --> 01:14:55.012
Your wife is on her way back now.
I'm...

01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:57.569
I'm gonna be parked outside...
through the day, through the night.

01:14:57.569 --> 01:15:00.794
- Just in case Miranda tries to come
back here. - Excellent, thank you.

01:15:00.794 --> 01:15:02.724
Sure you don't need to come inside?

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.543
- I'll be in the car.
- OK, thank you.

01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.110
- Miranda.
- Shhhhh.

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:04.340
Andrew?

01:16:07.085 --> 01:16:08.845
Andrew?

01:16:15.186 --> 01:16:17.287
- You're too late.
- Oh, my God, Andrew!

01:16:17.287 --> 01:16:19.791
It's not about him, Karen.
It's about you!

01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:22.598
We're blood. You should've stuck out
for your sister.

01:16:22.623 --> 01:16:24.540
You're crazy.

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:32.241
I wanted you to be different
but you ended up just like Mum.

01:16:32.241 --> 01:16:34.480
You killed her!

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:48.937
You don't know.
No, you need to hear this, Karen.

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:53.102
You need to hear what kind
of person your Mommy was.

01:16:53.102 --> 01:16:56.093
- You killed her.
- No, she made me!

01:16:56.093 --> 01:17:00.216
She made me kill her because I wrote
her a letter when I finally found her,

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:02.809
And I told her that I forgave her
for giving me up

01:17:02.809 --> 01:17:05.477
even though I had
a horrible life because of it.

01:17:05.477 --> 01:17:09.108
And I told her that I just wanted to
meet her. That's all I wanted, Karen.

01:17:09.108 --> 01:17:11.861
That's all I wanted.
I just wanted to meet her.

01:17:13.239 --> 01:17:14.856
And she called me.

01:17:14.856 --> 01:17:17.683
She called me and she said
that she had cancer.

01:17:17.683 --> 01:17:20.033
And that she was going down to Mexico.

01:17:20.033 --> 01:17:22.703
But that she would see me
when she got back.

01:17:22.781 --> 01:17:25.493
And I said OK,
I said OK...

01:17:26.312 --> 01:17:29.490
But then I couldn't...
I couldn't because...

01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:32.420
I had waited 27 years.

01:17:33.068 --> 01:17:34.992
Twenty-seven years...

01:17:34.992 --> 01:17:38.329
So I decided to go down to Mexico
and I was going to surprise her.

01:17:38.329 --> 01:17:39.881
<i>I'm looking for a guest.</i>

01:17:39.881 --> 01:17:43.595
And I walked all around
until I found her.

01:17:44.874 --> 01:17:48.138
And I followed her
to her hotel room.

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:50.868
And when I told her
who I was...

01:17:50.868 --> 01:17:53.725
I thought that she would
be happy to see me,

01:17:53.725 --> 01:17:55.330
you know, I mean the effort

01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:58.117
that I went through to find her
but she wasn't!

01:17:58.117 --> 01:18:01.390
She was mad that I came to see her
when she told me not to.

01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:05.424
And you know what, Karen? She wouldn't
answer any of my questions I asked her.

01:18:05.424 --> 01:18:07.946
Who my father was,
if I had siblings.

01:18:07.946 --> 01:18:10.112
Things that I have a right to know.

01:18:10.112 --> 01:18:14.050
If she would answer my questions...
I waited my whole life.

01:18:14.275 --> 01:18:17.451
I waited my whole life
for those answers.

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:21.540
She wouldn't tell me.

01:18:23.667 --> 01:18:26.179
- Why?
- Because... because...

01:18:26.179 --> 01:18:28.938
She wanted to wait
and tell you first.

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:31.251
She chose you over me...

01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:33.522
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hello? Hello?

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:34.913
I was so angry.

01:18:34.913 --> 01:18:39.190
Karen, I was so mad, I was so angry,
it just, you know, it just happened.

01:19:08.214 --> 01:19:11.448
That photo was
the only thing I had to go on.

01:19:11.535 --> 01:19:14.163
It took me months to find you.

01:19:14.864 --> 01:19:17.599
 But then, Andrew's accident...

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:20.729
And your picture in there was...

01:19:20.988 --> 01:19:23.997
I finally found you.

01:19:24.746 --> 01:19:29.269
It was like the universe had sacrificed
Andrew so that I could find you.

01:19:29.294 --> 01:19:32.751
And then, I saw you on Vacay N' Stay,

01:19:32.844 --> 01:19:36.022
and that was my perfect way in.

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.573
How could you kill her?
She is our mother.

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.184
Your mother!

01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:44.007
She's your mother. She's not my mother.
She never wanted to be my mother.

01:19:44.007 --> 01:19:48.243
Unit 3-4-7, you are watching
2214 Magnolia Boulevard?

01:19:48.634 --> 01:19:50.713
Unit 3-4-7, affirmative.

01:19:50.713 --> 01:19:54.424
We just received a 911 call
from inside that location.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:20:00.771
See, I don't blame you
for our mother's choices, Karen.

01:20:00.771 --> 01:20:03.951
But you did the same thing.
You did the same thing. You shut me out.

01:20:03.951 --> 01:20:07.237
You don't do that to family!
You don't do that to family.

01:20:07.237 --> 01:20:11.836
Now, you're gonna know what it's like
to lose everything you care about.

01:20:11.836 --> 01:20:13.709
- No!
- Who do you care about?

01:20:13.798 --> 01:20:16.127
Who should I kill first?

01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:21.126
You should just embrace me, Karen.
There'll be bodies here.

01:20:21.126 --> 01:20:23.609
Freeze!
Drop the knife!

01:20:23.609 --> 01:20:25.794
I said drop the knife!

01:20:25.794 --> 01:20:28.153
Drop the knife!

01:20:38.323 --> 01:20:40.162
Andrew!

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:46.144
This this Officer Friedman. I got a 10-42
at 2214 Magnolia Boulevard.

01:20:46.144 --> 01:20:48.255
I need back-up
and medical assistance.

01:20:48.255 --> 01:20:49.935
Suspect is down.

01:21:01.544 --> 01:21:03.804
I wouldn't call it a promotion,
I mean...

01:21:03.804 --> 01:21:05.677
It's a desk job,
you know...

01:21:05.702 --> 01:21:07.678
It's still more money, right?

01:21:07.678 --> 01:21:10.269
Yeah, yeah, I'm making more
now than I was ever before.

01:21:10.269 --> 01:21:12.818
OK, well, in my world,
that's a promotion.

01:21:12.818 --> 01:21:15.527
Now, speaking of which,
is it possible to borrow a little cash?

01:21:15.527 --> 01:21:18.021
- I helped you move.
- Of course.

01:21:18.046 --> 01:21:20.124
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:21:20.124 --> 01:21:23.071
- You're the first one here.
- Well, that never happens.

01:21:23.071 --> 01:21:26.572
Well, except for Tyler, of course,
who's here all the time.

01:21:26.732 --> 01:21:28.760
Hello!

01:21:31.545 --> 01:21:32.748
- How's work?
- Good!

01:21:32.748 --> 01:21:34.409
I hear you guys are
going to Florida.

01:21:34.409 --> 01:21:35.904
Yeah.

01:21:36.288 --> 01:21:38.996
Hey, guys, so I was thinking about
this vacation we were talking about...

01:21:38.996 --> 01:21:40.358
I did a little digging,
a little research,

01:21:40.358 --> 01:21:42.971
and I found us
a really good deal.
