WEBVTT

00:28.237 --> 00:32.651
We've had a difficult relationship
with law enforcement for many years.

00:33.576 --> 00:36.033
The man provoked me.
I could've done much worse.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.284
I'm sure you could have.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.242
If I wasn't watching,
you probably would've killed that man.

00:40.416 --> 00:43.283
-Hardly.
-Would you have bit him?

00:43.461 --> 00:45.543
See, that's just crazy.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.796
You would've fed on him,
then tossed him like an old chicken bone.

00:48.966 --> 00:52.299
And don't tell me
that's what vampires do.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.131
I'm doing my best.

00:55.306 --> 00:58.594
Sucking the blood from a police officer
is not mainstreaming.

00:58.768 --> 01:02.477
Neither is hosting orgies
or listening to crazy Chinese gargling.

01:02.647 --> 01:04.478
-lt's Tuvan throat singing.
-Whatever.

01:04.649 --> 01:06.765
Tuvan? I don't even know where that is.

01:06.943 --> 01:11.107
Sookie, you cannot be frightened
of everything you don't know in this world.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.566
Well, my world's opening up
mighty fast...

01:13.741 --> 01:16.904
...and what I got here may be boring,
but it's safe.

01:17.078 --> 01:21.321
And after the past couple of nights,
safe sounds pretty good about now.

01:21.832 --> 01:25.620
No, thank you. I can get this door myself.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.001
I won't call on you again.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.709
Stupid fucking bitch.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.041
Bring it on.
l was all-parish in high school.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.457
I knew there were stupid genes
in our family...

03:37.635 --> 03:39.341
...but you must have gotten them all.

03:39.512 --> 03:42.629
-When did you start dealing V?
-You want some? You could use it.

03:42.807 --> 03:45.890
You making jokes about it?
You gonna get killed, dumb motherfucker.

03:46.060 --> 03:50.144
Is this because I'm selling V, or because
I sold it to your sweet Jason Stackhouse?

03:50.314 --> 03:53.898
Giving vampire blood to Jason Stackhouse
is like giving Ho Hos to a diabetic.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.151
-You know he can't control himself.
-I was clear on how to use it.

03:57.321 --> 04:01.564
-It ain't my fault he didn't listen.
-I had to take him to the ER.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.825
They drained his penis
with a needle the size of an ice pick.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.656
Twice.

04:06.831 --> 04:09.664
It was the most disturbing shit
I've seen in my entire life...

04:09.834 --> 04:12.075
...and l have seen
some pretty disturbing shit.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.834
-Okay.
-He suffered, Lafayette.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.039
-Okay.
-Bad.

04:15.214 --> 04:19.253
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'll go and check in on him in the morning.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.751
And I know he mean a lot to you
and everything...

04:21.929 --> 04:24.341
...but how is coming up in my joint
at 3 am...

04:24.515 --> 04:27.097
...throwing my shit around
gonna make anything better?

04:27.476 --> 04:29.512
It makes me feel better.

04:32.565 --> 04:34.226
Okay.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.152
Shame on you, Ade/e Stackhouse.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.025
-Shame on you.
-Who is this?

04:39.196 --> 04:41.027
A vampire is a perversion of humanity.

04:41.198 --> 04:44.690
And you are perverting our community
by bringing one into the open.

04:44.869 --> 04:47.531
| suggest you hear what he has to say
before lynching him.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.287
I don’t care what vagrants you keep
in your own home...

04:50.458 --> 04:52.665
...but when you bring freaks
and abominations...

04:52.835 --> 04:55.827
...into our churches in front of our children,
you will have to--

04:56.005 --> 05:01.500
Well, I will be at the church early
if you would like to stop by and say hi.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.419
Mr. Compton's talk starts at 8.

05:04.597 --> 05:08.931
-You will go to hell for this.
-All right, same to you. Bye, now.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.435
Phone's been ringing early today.

05:13.606 --> 05:19.476
Oh, everyone is excited
about meeting the town vampire tonight.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.105
-I didn't hear you come in last night.
-You went to bed early.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.023
You didn't wanna hear me come in.

05:26.202 --> 05:30.491
Well, ljust thought I would give you two
a little privacy, is all.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.200
Am I that much of a lost cause...

05:32.374 --> 05:34.831
...that you gotta pin your hopes for me
on a vampire?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.493
-But he seems like a very nice man.
-Well, he's not.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.083
-He's not nice?
-Or a man.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.249
-Oh, goodness, did you two have a fight?
-No.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.257
Kind of.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.390
I don't think Bill and l
have very much in common.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.936
He doesn't think like we do...

05:53.103 --> 05:57.437
...he doesn't feel the way we do,
if he feels at all.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.151
Well, I know that ifl had a chance...

06:03.322 --> 06:06.109
...to know somebody
who experienced the world differently...

06:06.283 --> 06:10.196
...l'd see it as a blessing
and not something to be scared of.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.987
-Or hate.
-I don't hate him.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.905
| just don't wanna be his girlfriend.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.748
The phone's ringing.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.207
Machine will pick it up.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.970
-Damn.
-Yeah, just like that.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.930
And no anesthesia either.

06:36.981 --> 06:42.726
First | get hauled in by the cops.
Then I gotta let a dude drain my johnson.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.521
-That's a fuck of a day.
-Sounds like it.

06:47.992 --> 06:53.282
Jason, you didn't tell nobody
where you get the V at, did you?

06:53.455 --> 06:54.490
Do I look stupid?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.368
I didn't even let on l was taking anything.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.659
-You're my dawg.
-Well, I love you right back.

06:59.837 --> 07:04.171
But listen, you gotta stop selling V, man.
It fucks people up.

07:04.341 --> 07:09.085
I mean, shit, now Sheriff Dearborne thinks
I'm some kind of sex maniac.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.755
And hell ifl know how I'll ever,
ever be able to look Tara in the face again.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.469
Well, she'll get over it.

07:14.643 --> 07:18.352
The girl's been lost in love with you
since she was 8.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.931
-No shit?
-No shit.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.774
Oh, man, that's even worse.
I had no idea.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.694
My life sucks so much ass.
And it's all because of your fucking V.

07:34.872 --> 07:39.161
Listen, don't blame the Ferrari
just because your ass can't drive.

07:39.335 --> 07:42.042
You're gonna have to learn
how to ride the high, boyfriend.

07:42.212 --> 07:45.545
Fuck that, I am done with V.
Go fuck some other people up with that.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.253
-You broke me.
-No, man.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.213
If you can learn to control it...

07:50.387 --> 07:53.879
...V will open up your mind
to everything you missing around you.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.095
That's what's gonna snap you
out of all this shit.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.721
-More V?
-If done right.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.270
I got some in my car...

08:06.654 --> 08:08.565
...if you want me to show you.

08:18.082 --> 08:22.826
Now, I ain't selling you no whole vial
until you learn how to use this shit right.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.834
You get me?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.795
This...

08:32.554 --> 08:34.931
...is the life force of a vampire.

08:36.392 --> 08:39.850
They're just blood in a skin casing.

08:40.604 --> 08:45.598
Ain't a whole lot different between
a vampire and a boudin sausage except...

08:46.610 --> 08:48.771
...for the blood.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.895
Our blood sustains life.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.280
This blood...

08:55.411 --> 08:57.276
...is life.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.569
One drop.

08:59.915 --> 09:03.407
That's all you need. Can't be greedy.

09:03.585 --> 09:09.046
Billions of molecules of pure,
undiluted, 24-karat life.

09:10.968 --> 09:14.051
You take this in, you take in
a piece of the vampire it came from.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.964
The trick is,
you have to let it take you deep.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.424
Follow it.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.889
Soak it in.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.904
What kind of vampire is that?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.323
He's new.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.907
So the blood is still a little wild.

09:45.919 --> 09:50.288
I can feel him in my muscles,
making me strong.

09:53.761 --> 09:57.674
But you might get another side of him.

09:57.848 --> 10:01.306
The same V could affect you
in a whole other way.

10:03.020 --> 10:06.353
But I guarantee you will see the world
with new eyes.

10:23.874 --> 10:27.958
-Christ, I can't believe I'm doing this again.
-Oh, no, man.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.665
You're doing it for the first time.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.005
That vampire Bill
would get a rise out of that.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.671
You'll have to ask him yourself.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.557
Vamp club not all
it was made out to be, huh?

10:44.728 --> 10:48.562
Lot of freaks, I hear.
And people from Arkansas.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.313
It was fine.

10:50.484 --> 10:54.022
So, what, then?
Did that vampire get all handsy with you?

10:54.196 --> 10:56.437
Arlene, I can take care of myself.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.072
And, no,
I won't be going out with him again.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.865
Okay, that place was kind of freaky...

11:04.039 --> 11:06.655
...but how are you gonna know
until you see for yourself?

11:06.834 --> 11:10.543
-I said my piece yesterday.
-l'm sorry it didn't turn out like you hoped.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.920
But better it happens now
than before you end up hurt or dead.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.924
Have a good night.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.378
Hope you're not too flipped out...

11:21.557 --> 11:24.094
...to miss the Descendants
of the Glorious Dead tonight.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.759
I gotta go. Gran spent all week on it.

11:26.937 --> 11:30.771
Good, because I was gonna ask
if you wanna go with me.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.767
You know, maybe we'll go
grab a cup of coffee or something after?

11:38.115 --> 11:39.525
Are you asking me out?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.111
Yeah, I am.

11:42.286 --> 11:46.950
That's pretty much how I do it.
Sometimes they even say yes.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.083
-Everyone's looking at us.
-I know, you better say yes.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.040
Shoot

11:59.136 --> 12:02.299
-Why not?
-Good.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.969
Eyes back on your food, people.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.805
Sorry about that.
They were all kind of watery.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.224
No sweat. Love is in the air, huh?

12:17.905 --> 12:20.487
-lguess.
-Even that brother of yours.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.272
He getting serious with Tara?

12:22.826 --> 12:25.488
Tara who? "Tara" Tara?

12:26.663 --> 12:30.497
-Oh, I thought you knew.
-If there was any truth to it, I would.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.168
Tara ain't banging Stackhouse.
Bitch lied to me.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.625
-Watch your mouth, Andy.
-I didn't say anything.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.381
I know / didn’t say anything,
but I did think it.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.840
And you heard it. That means it’s true.
You can hear what people think.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.630
Let me get you a refill on that tea.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.853
Need a sweet tea. Tara here yet?

12:53.023 --> 12:55.935
She just came in.
She's in the ladies' room.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.237
Why didn't you tell me
you were going out with Sam?

13:02.407 --> 13:05.444
Because itjust happened.
And how did you know?

13:05.619 --> 13:07.325
Arlene. She works fast.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.612
All he did was ask me
to the DGD tonight.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.703
It's in a church, for crying out loud.
And why shouldn't I?

13:13.877 --> 13:17.461
He's perfectly nice, he's got a good job,
and he's not a vampire, and--

13:17.631 --> 13:21.499
-Why do l have to justify this to you?
-l'm entitled to know what my girl's up to.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.339
Yeah, about that.

13:24.513 --> 13:27.596
Why does Andy Bellefleur think
you're seeing my brother?

13:28.976 --> 13:31.217
I went to the sheriff's
and gave Jason an alibi.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.558
-What did you do that for?
-Because I know he's innocent. So do you.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.847
And the more time he spends
with the police...

13:37.025 --> 13:39.858
...the more he's gonna talk himself
into trouble.

13:40.946 --> 13:44.564
-ls there something you're not telling me?
-No.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.994
What are you doing?

13:51.164 --> 13:55.123
Not every detail of everyone's personal life
is your business, okay?

13:57.421 --> 14:00.003
Keep that girl away from me.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.964
-Arlene, come and pick up your....
-Hey.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.173
Is everything okay?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.302
Hey, you know, now that I think of it...

14:11.476 --> 14:14.639
...my brother and Tara
have kind of been sneaking around lately.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.179
Shame they feel they gotta keep it quiet.

14:17.858 --> 14:21.396
She must think I’m an idiot. Like I
don't know she's covering for him too.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.435
Shit, don't look her in the eye.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.604
If you're gonna accuse me of lying...

14:25.782 --> 14:28.524
...be a man and say it out loud,
for Pete's sake.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.944
Either way I'm gonna hear you,
whether you look me in the eye or not.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.829
Let's face it,
there's not a whole lot of ideas in there.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.456
Like mice in a cage.

14:36.626 --> 14:41.245
I know you're grasping at straws,
but don't drag my brother down with you.

14:49.931 --> 14:53.469
-Here you go.
-Hoyt. Hoyt.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.389
Hey. Mama, what are you doing?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.730
-Help Mama get this thing down.
-Get it...?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.900
Our guest of honor is a vampire.

15:08.075 --> 15:12.068
Adele plumb forgot that little fact
when she booked the church for tonight.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.737
What do you think's gonna happen
when he comes out and sees a giant cross?

15:15.916 --> 15:17.872
-I don't know.
-Well, I don't either.

15:18.043 --> 15:21.001
But if he sizzles up like fatback bacon
in front of everybody...

15:21.171 --> 15:23.457
...there's not gonna be much
of a meeting, now.

15:23.632 --> 15:28.296
-Now, come on, make yourself useful.
-Quit jerking on it.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.301
Hi there, munchkins.

15:30.472 --> 15:34.636
Oh, I reckon you're the youngest
history buffs we've had at the DGD.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.472
Yeah, well,
they wouldn't stay home for nothing.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.979
The minute they heard "vampire,"
they had to come.

15:42.692 --> 15:46.184
-Well, hello there, Mayor Norris.
-Evening, Adele.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.944
-Quite a turnout.
-lsn't it?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.447
Good thing Myra made extra ambrosia.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.825
Oh, Andy Bellefleur will like that.
He's with the Dearbornes.

15:53.995 --> 15:57.362
Though Lord knows why Bud insisted
on wearing his uniform.

15:57.749 --> 16:01.788
-ls our vampire friend here?
-In the kitchen, waiting.

16:02.671 --> 16:06.584
[left him with a bottle
of that Tru Blood they like.

16:06.758 --> 16:11.377
Adele, do you think
we've taken enough precautions?

16:11.555 --> 16:15.389
-Against what?
-Well, to make sure everybody's safe.

16:16.768 --> 16:21.683
Ordinarily I wouldn't pay no mind,
but there's young folks here.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.724
Sterling, we don't have anything
to be frightened of.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.064
Mr. Compton is a perfect gentleman.

16:28.905 --> 16:33.023
Frankly, I am more worried
about what we might do to him.

16:40.750 --> 16:44.709
Mama, this ain't gonna budge
without a jackhammer or a blowtorch.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.754
Get down from there. I got a better idea.

16:47.924 --> 16:51.587
-Wow, Gran, look at all the people.
-lsn't it exciting?

16:52.429 --> 16:54.670
Well, Sam Merlotte, what a nice surprise.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.554
Sookie told me she was coming alone.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.432
Thought it would be a shame
if she came without an escort.

16:59.603 --> 17:05.269
-Well, how very gentleman/y of you.
-Okay, we 're sitting down now.

17:11.281 --> 17:14.318
-Yup. I see him.
-Sookie will.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.780
Hey, girl. Can we join you?

17:18.622 --> 17:21.329
-Hi, Tara.
-Sure, come on in.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.239
Could always use more white people.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.711
If you can learn to control it...

17:36.890 --> 17:40.803
V will open up your mind
to everything you missing around you.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.935
There's nothing but old people.

17:52.113 --> 17:55.276
Man, I thought we were here for a vampire,
not zombies.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.692
Yeah, more like
Descendants of the Walking Dead.

18:01.498 --> 18:05.832
Hey, you assholes didn't leave the shit
in the pick-them-up, did you?

18:06.795 --> 18:09.582
-lt's in the Book of Revelation.
-Of course it is, yeah.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.839
That's what I'm saying.
If you know your Scriptures....

18:19.432 --> 18:23.596
Because usually they get them
right in the neck, right there.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.197
Hey.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.783
Mind if I sit with you?

18:46.042 --> 18:49.910
-Sure, have a seat.
-Hey, guys.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.710
-How you feeling?
-Oh, strong.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.711
Alive.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.092
Yup.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.847
Hey, sit back.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.136
-lt's okay to relax.
-I thought I was relaxed.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.847
I don't think you know how.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.693
Welcome.

19:16.906 --> 19:22.401
It certainly is a pleasure
to see so many new faces here this month.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.987
But Mayor Norris assures me...

19:25.165 --> 19:29.750
...that there will be enough ambrosia
and tipsy cake for everyone.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.711
Now, our guest tonight
is a gentleman who...

19:36.885 --> 19:40.594
...despite what you might have heard,
is one of us.

19:40.764 --> 19:44.427
His family was among the first to settle
in Bon Temps...

19:44.601 --> 19:49.595
...and he bravely fought for Louisiana
in the War for Southern Independence.

19:49.773 --> 19:53.311
Let us welcome one of the original sons
of Bon Temps...

19:53.485 --> 19:58.320
...back to the town that he helped build.

19:58.490 --> 20:05.282
I give you
First Lieutenant William Thomas Compton.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.289
Thank you, Mrs. Stackhouse.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.833
If you'll pardon me for a moment.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.815
As a patriot of this great nation...

20:39.989 --> 20:42.981
...I wouldn't dream of putting myself
before Old Glory.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.751
As you can see,
I did not burst into flames.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.838
We vampires are not minions of the devil.

20:59.717 --> 21:04.802
We can stand before a cross or a bible
or in a church...

21:04.973 --> 21:07.430
...just as readily
as any other creature of God.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.764
-Well, how was I supposed to know?
-I am honored to stand before you tonight.

21:11.938 --> 21:15.226
Vampires have traditionally
been very private...

21:15.400 --> 21:17.857
...perhaps to our detriment.

21:18.027 --> 21:22.612
But I believe if we reach out to one another
that we can coexist...

21:23.700 --> 21:26.362
...and even thrive together.

21:31.082 --> 21:34.700
I served in the 28th Louisiana Infantry...

21:34.878 --> 21:39.372
...formed in Monroe in 1862
under Colonel Henry Gray.

21:39.549 --> 21:43.588
It was there that we learned the value
of human life...

21:43.761 --> 21:46.218
...and the ease
with which it can be extinguished.

21:46.389 --> 21:49.927
That son of a buck's been killing
since the 1860s.

21:50.101 --> 21:53.889
-Why stop now?
-That don't prove anything.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.975
My cousin Terry killed 20 Iraqis
in Fallujah.

21:57.150 --> 22:01.109
-You saying we should lock him up?
-Your cousin Terry should be locked up.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.610
Uneducated as we were...

22:02.780 --> 22:06.364
...we knew little of the political
or ideological conflicts...

22:06.534 --> 22:08.070
...that had lead to this point.

22:08.578 --> 22:11.069
Mama, he's so white.

22:11.247 --> 22:15.240
No, darling, we're white. He's dead.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.543
But going to war
was not a choice for us.

22:20.465 --> 22:26.711
We believed, to a man,
that we had a calling to fulfill...

22:26.888 --> 22:30.722
...a destiny handed down to us
from above.

22:31.392 --> 22:35.556
God forbid should any of our men
become wounded or injured.

22:35.730 --> 22:39.769
Often the only recourse for a serious injury
was amputation.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.934
More times than I care to remember...

22:42.111 --> 22:44.397
...I had to hold down
one of my fellow soldiers...

22:44.572 --> 22:46.779
...while the medic took a saw
to his arm or leg.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.736
We had no anesthesia at the time...

22:48.910 --> 22:50.525
-...apart from whiskey.
-Load it up.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.955
It often seemed
that the man being operated on...

22:53.122 --> 22:56.580
...suffered more from his surgery
than he did from his original wound.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.912
Even if he survived the amputation...

22:59.087 --> 23:01.203
...the chance of subsequent infection
was high.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.087
Fucken

23:03.258 --> 23:04.623
Keep it down.

23:07.929 --> 23:11.137
In the winter months,
the nights could grow bitter cold.

23:49.012 --> 23:52.004
My great-grandfather was in the 28th.

23:52.181 --> 23:56.174
I wonder if you might have known him.
His name was Tolliver Humphries.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.764
Tolliver Humphries?

23:58.938 --> 24:02.271
Yes. I knew him very well.

24:02.442 --> 24:06.355
We fought together.
Tolliver Humphries was my friend.

24:06.529 --> 24:09.771
He was a brave man, perhaps to a fault.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.326
I daresay it contributed to his death.

24:12.493 --> 24:17.112
-What happened? Were you there?
-I was.

24:17.665 --> 24:21.533
We were about 20 miles north
of where I stand now.

24:21.711 --> 24:26.455
The Federals outnumbered us 5-to-1,
and they had better ﬁrepower as well.

24:26.633 --> 24:30.046
We 'd spent much of the afternoon
recovering the bodies of those we 'd lost.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.379
Help me, please!

24:31.554 --> 24:35.342
There was a boy in our troop,
no more than 13 or 14...

24:35.516 --> 24:38.849
...who lay wounded in the middle
of a ﬁeld under poor cover.

24:39.020 --> 24:42.512
He called to us all day.
He begged us to help him.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.806
He knew he would die if we didn't.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.067
I admit I considered shooting the boy myself
just to shut him up.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.226
Help me, please!

24:49.405 --> 24:51.862
Tolliver convinced me
that would be an act of murder.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.773
Hold your fire.

24:54.369 --> 24:56.405
He told me God wanted him
to rescue that boy.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.945
-|'|| go get him.
-I pleaded with him not to go...

24:59.123 --> 25:01.614
...to think of his own Wife
and children back home.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.751
But he ran into that ﬁeld
like it was a cool spring day.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.502
Please!

25:09.592 --> 25:12.584
They shot him
just as he reached the boy.

25:14.097 --> 25:17.305
It was obvious to us
that he was beyond help.

25:19.018 --> 25:24.183
And then after a while,
the boy started screaming again.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.780
What happened to the boy?

25:35.326 --> 25:36.782
He lived.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.446
He survived the day...

25:41.833 --> 25:46.293
...and then under cover of darkness,
we retrieved him later that night...

25:46.462 --> 25:49.374
...along with the body
of Tolliver Humphries.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.342
But it seems that Tolliver was right.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.965
God did look after his descendants.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.969
Yes, Mayor Norris?

26:05.148 --> 26:10.063
I've been digging
in the archives this week...

26:10.611 --> 26:14.274
...and I found this old tintype.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.656
The inscription on the back says:

26:16.826 --> 26:20.489
"Mr. W.T. Compton and family."

26:21.330 --> 26:25.118
Can you tell us if this is a picture of you?

26:38.848 --> 26:40.884
This....

26:41.058 --> 26:43.515
This is a remarkable photograph.

26:44.896 --> 26:48.013
I remember the day we gathered
to have this taken.

26:48.191 --> 26:50.807
When was the last time
you were with them?

26:52.987 --> 26:57.196
When I went to war in 1862.

27:02.246 --> 27:05.488
My human life ended before I had a chance
to come back home.

27:09.212 --> 27:13.706
But you became a vampire
after that, right?

27:13.883 --> 27:16.374
Couldn't you go back to your family then?

27:20.056 --> 27:21.512
No.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.886
No, that wouldn't have been possible.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.560
I apologize.

27:31.734 --> 27:34.567
This is not a subject
I'm very comfortable speaking about.

27:37.073 --> 27:39.234
But thank you for the photograph, mayor.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.237
Brings back many memories for me.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.165
Any other questions?

27:54.799 --> 27:56.881
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks for coming, dear.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.086
Thank you, sir.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.268
They don't understand, man.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.520
None of them will ever understand.

28:12.441 --> 28:16.059
-You stay sharp, brother.
-All right.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.275
Could |--?

28:20.449 --> 28:23.031
Would it be possible
to take a picture with you?

28:23.202 --> 28:26.694
-Of course.
-You won't vanish in the photo?

28:26.873 --> 28:30.616
That's just a myth.
And it's one I'd be happy to disprove.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.535
Come on around.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.167
All right.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.134
All right.

28:42.305 --> 28:45.138
-Here you are.
-Thanks so much, Adele.

28:46.601 --> 28:50.970
-Hey. Great job tonight.
-Wasn't he just marvelous?

28:51.147 --> 28:53.638
Yeah, that was-- That was quite a show.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.099
Billy, you remember Sam, right?

28:56.277 --> 28:59.986
-Yes, you're Sookie's employer.
-Not when we're off duty.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.317
No, legally, you still are.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.822
Well, I just wanted to congratulate you.

29:06.996 --> 29:10.113
It seems like you've won everybody over.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.828
Well, some, I hope.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.502
Well, we better get going.

29:16.672 --> 29:19.414
We're gonna grab a cup of coffee
before we call it a night.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.925
Coffee. Sounds delightful.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.672
Good night, Gran. I'll see you later.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.643
He seems nice.

29:47.578 --> 29:52.368
Man, this place is crawling with hot chicks,
and we're just sitting here.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.919
You want a girl so bad,
you get one yourself, you.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.923
-Want another round?
-Yeah.

30:02.093 --> 30:05.881
Hey, maybe we should order up
a couple of those Tru Bloods.

30:07.139 --> 30:11.132
Well, after meeting that vampire tonight,
don't you wanna try it, see what it's like?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.347
I go to the dog races.
You see me eating Alpo?

30:14.522 --> 30:17.559
Well, I just thought he was pretty cool,
was all.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.065
Another Dixie Draft?

30:21.112 --> 30:23.023
Stackhouse?

30:29.078 --> 30:30.659
Jason.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.244
-Dixie Draft?
-Yeah. I'll get it.

30:36.419 --> 30:39.001
-I love you guys.
-I know.

30:42.091 --> 30:44.082
Another Dixie Draft?

30:47.263 --> 30:49.174
You feel that?

30:50.641 --> 30:54.099
Every hair on your arm's
shooting sparks into my hand.

30:54.437 --> 30:57.600
You know those electric fences
they use to pen horses?

30:58.274 --> 31:00.265
It feels like I just pissed on one.

31:00.443 --> 31:03.059
Oh, my God, you are still high.
I'm gonna kill Lafayette.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.774
No, don't. I'm not high.

31:07.450 --> 31:10.738
Okay, I am high, but that don't mean
that what I'm feeling ain't real.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.617
For the first time, I can see clear.

31:12.788 --> 31:13.777
All these years...

31:13.956 --> 31:17.369
...I was blinded by the bullshit
that keeps people apart.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.329
It's you, Tara.

31:20.171 --> 31:23.004
-It's been you all along.
-Who you think you're talking to?

31:23.174 --> 31:28.089
-|'ve known you since I was 6 years old.
-And it's taken me all this time to admit it.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.218
Come here.

31:33.726 --> 31:37.514
This bar might be full
of beautiful women...

31:37.688 --> 31:40.395
...but you're the one who took care of me
when I needed it.

31:40.566 --> 31:44.775
You showed me love, Tara,
and that's the most beautiful thing of all.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.654
Come to me when you're sober.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.737
Then we can talk serious.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.165
Just give me a chance.
I'll prove it to you.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.793
Everything I'm feeling...

32:05.091 --> 32:07.332
...I wanna feel it with you.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.925
One chance.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.882
That's all I'm asking.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.480
-Last bite's yours.
-No, you go ahead.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.401
Here, we'll split it.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.863
Well, I guess you saw this coming, huh?

32:32.785 --> 32:35.276
What? Tonight?

32:35.454 --> 32:36.534
What makes you say that?

32:37.123 --> 32:40.206
I said you could listen in,
hear what I'm thinking if you wanted.

32:40.376 --> 32:42.241
-You never even tried?
-No, I have.

32:42.419 --> 32:45.877
And to be honest, it was a little weird.

32:46.048 --> 32:48.004
You don't think the way others do.

32:48.425 --> 32:52.043
Most people,
it's whole sentences or images.

32:52.221 --> 32:56.339
With you, sometimes there's words,
but other times I just get these sounds...

32:56.517 --> 32:59.634
...like waves of emotions.

32:59.812 --> 33:03.555
-I guess I'm just a freak.
-I was gonna say "mysterious."

33:07.236 --> 33:10.069
How come nobody knows anything
aboutyou?

33:10.239 --> 33:14.448
I never hear you talk about where
you're from or your family or anything.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.028
The place I'm from...

33:16.203 --> 33:19.286
...and the people who raised me
got nothing to do with who I am.

33:19.456 --> 33:23.495
-And I ended up pretty much raising myself.
-Is that why you spend so much time alone?

33:24.128 --> 33:26.540
No, Ithink that'sjust
because I don't like people.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.330
Come on, no one opens a bar
if they don't like people.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.841
Well, maybe I wanted
to meet some pretty waitresses.

33:36.056 --> 33:39.264
Too bad you got yourself
a couple crazy ones in the bargain.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.727
Sookie, there's nothing wrong with you.

33:45.107 --> 33:49.271
I can't understand why you'd wanna fix
or change or hide anything.

33:49.445 --> 33:51.606
I wouldn't want you any other way.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.236
You're just trying to get on my good side.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.780
How am I doing?

34:00.831 --> 34:02.492
Finish it.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.297
That's yours.

34:18.641 --> 34:22.634
-Is there a problem with my burger?
-Just a couple of drunk rednecks, that's all.

34:23.520 --> 34:28.480
-Well, what's their problem?
-Oh, come on, now, it's not worth it.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.437
-What did they say?
-He said the burger--

34:34.615 --> 34:38.654
-What did they say, Arlene?
-He said the burger might have AIDS.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.578
Lafayette.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.996
Oh, fudge.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.928
Excuse me.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.841
Who ordered the hamburger...

35:03.018 --> 35:04.349
...with AIDS?

35:09.191 --> 35:11.273
I ordered the hamburger deluxe.

35:11.694 --> 35:15.152
In this restaurant, a hamburger deluxe
come with french fries...

35:15.322 --> 35:18.439
...lettuce, tomato, mayo and AIDS.

35:19.034 --> 35:22.868
-Do anybody got a problem with that?
-Yeah.

35:23.038 --> 35:26.326
I'm an American,
and I got a say in who makes my food.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.115
Well, baby, it's too late for that.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.910
Faggots been breeding your cows,
raising your chickens...

35:31.088 --> 35:33.955
...brewing your beer
long before I walked my sexy ass in.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.625
Everything on your goddamn table
got AIDS.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.465
You still ain't making me
eat no AIDS burger.

35:43.142 --> 35:46.885
Well, all you gotta do is say,
"Hold the AIDS."

35:47.062 --> 35:48.472
Here.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.804
Eat it.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.445
Bitch, you come in my house, you gonna
eat my food the way I fucking make it!

35:58.615 --> 35:59.991
Do you understand me?

36:04.079 --> 36:06.195
Tip your waitress.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.843
Well, I am thankful
you can't hear all my thoughts.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.006
-Why's that?
-Because then you'd know what's coming.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.607
-You okay? Are we going too fast?
-No.No.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.271
Maybe.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.782
I don't wanna make you do anything
you don't wanna.

36:43.952 --> 36:47.240
-I do, I do, I do. Trust me.
-Yeah.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.279
I want to.

36:49.458 --> 36:54.168
It's just kind of too much right now
and a little too soon, since....

36:54.338 --> 36:55.999
Okay.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.545
Since what?

37:00.386 --> 37:02.377
Oh, goddamn it, Sookie.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.546
I'm sorry. I'm not used to this.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.931
Should never have gone
to see that damn vampire.

37:08.102 --> 37:11.310
It's not him. Just stop it.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.768
I just can't go jumping
from kissing one man to the next so quickly.

37:14.942 --> 37:17.058
-You kissed him?
-That's none of your business.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.652
-What else did you do?
-That's really none of your business.

37:20.823 --> 37:23.314
Is this a contest?
Whatever he did, you have to top it?

37:23.492 --> 37:24.732
Come on, be fair.

37:24.910 --> 37:28.494
Unfair is you waiting till someone else
shows an interest before you kiss me.

37:28.664 --> 37:30.746
Sookie, you have no future
with a vampire.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.453
They don't die.
I've got nothing but a future with one.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.959
Just like Dawn had a future?
Like Maudette Pickens?

37:36.130 --> 37:37.495
Bill did not kill those women.

37:37.673 --> 37:41.165
Listen, there's nothing I will not do
to keep that thing from hurting you.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.050
They're not like us.
They could turn on you.

37:44.847 --> 37:49.011
And people can't?
You're doing pretty good right now.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.187
All right, I think I best take you home.

37:56.859 --> 37:59.475
You go ahead. I'll call a cab.

37:59.653 --> 38:03.362
Oh, for crying out loud,
don't be stupid, Sookie, get in.

38:03.532 --> 38:05.022
SooMe.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.877
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:20.674 --> 38:23.006
Whip. Whip.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.220
What you doing, baby?

38:36.899 --> 38:40.187
Oh, you know, keeping it real. Partying.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.693
Me too. I'm celebrating.

38:43.864 --> 38:46.150
Oh, yeah? What's the occasion?

38:46.825 --> 38:49.692
My divorce went through today.

38:51.830 --> 38:55.914
-That's great.
-He was a jerk. He shot my car.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.576
-Sorry to hear that.
-Yeah?

38:59.755 --> 39:01.916
It's like watching Animal Planet, yeah?

39:02.090 --> 39:04.706
Any second,
she gonna bite his head off, I swear.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.260
So...

39:09.640 --> 39:12.598
...you wanna help me
forget all about him?

39:14.686 --> 39:17.018
She asked me to come home with her.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.936
-So, what are you doing here, you?
-I said I'd think about it.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.772
Yeah, you a lost cause.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.280
What? I just didn't feel that-- That spark.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.116
Another Dixie Draft.

39:32.746 --> 39:36.284
Tru Blood, O-negative.
No refunds on that, Hoyt.

39:36.959 --> 39:38.290
Oh, it's hot.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.787
That's the way it's served: 98.6.

39:51.431 --> 39:52.466
That shit is nasty.

39:52.975 --> 39:55.842
Yeah, what'd you expect?
They supposed to taste like blood.

39:56.019 --> 39:59.056
I thought it was supposed to be
some sort of life force.

39:59.231 --> 40:03.099
Tru Blood don't do nothing.
The real life force is V.

40:03.819 --> 40:06.811
-V?
-Vampire blood. It's illegal.

40:06.989 --> 40:09.731
All our blood belongs to the universe.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.991
They take some from us,
we take a little from them.

40:13.161 --> 40:15.573
I just say no to drugs, merci.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.160
It might give you the will
to seal the deal with that girl.

40:19.334 --> 40:23.247
Only thing holding you back is you.

40:34.182 --> 40:37.140
Oh, Shit.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.273
Look.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.773
What do you see, son?

40:53.535 --> 40:58.325
Mr. Compton?
I'm Bud Dearborne, sheriff of Renard Parish.

40:58.498 --> 41:02.207
-This here's Detective Andy Bellefleur.
-Bellefleur?

41:05.964 --> 41:07.545
What can I do for you gentlemen?

41:07.716 --> 41:12.005
We'd like to ask you questions pertaining
to an investigation, if you don't mind.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.636
Of course. Why don't you come on in?

41:17.059 --> 41:18.890
Into the house?

41:27.903 --> 41:30.519
Please, make yourselves at home.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.326
May I offer you a drink?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.032
No, thank you.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.493
-I have Frescas.
-You do?

41:42.668 --> 41:46.081
-For guests.
-Well, I'll have a Fresca.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.511
-What the hell are you doing?
-He offered.

41:53.679 --> 41:57.092
-He's a suspect.
-Maybe to you. We got no evidence.

41:57.557 --> 42:00.048
He's a vampire.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.700
It's a toaster. For bread.

42:22.874 --> 42:26.412
You put the slices in the end
and then you cook them over the hearth.

42:27.087 --> 42:30.796
I don't use it anymore, as I no longer eat.

42:37.472 --> 42:40.009
You said you had some questions
for me.

42:40.183 --> 42:44.051
We're investigating a couple of homicides
that took place locally in the past week.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.264
I've heard.

42:45.439 --> 42:49.603
Were you familiar with either of the victims,
Maudette Pickens or Dawn Green?

42:49.776 --> 42:53.018
Miss Pickens, no, but Miss Green...

42:53.196 --> 42:56.279
...I believe she worked
over at Sam Merlotte's place.

42:56.450 --> 42:58.236
We never spoke, but I saw her.

42:58.410 --> 43:02.449
Were you aware that both
had sexual contact with vampires?

43:02.622 --> 43:03.657
I was not.

43:03.999 --> 43:06.331
But it's more common
than you would think.

43:08.837 --> 43:11.169
Have anybody that can vouch
for your whereabouts...

43:11.339 --> 43:14.126
...on the night of the 23rd and the 27th?

43:15.010 --> 43:17.001
Tell me, sheriff...

43:17.179 --> 43:21.138
...were either of these unfortunate women
exsanguinated when you found them?

43:23.435 --> 43:25.517
Drained of their blood?

43:26.188 --> 43:28.520
If you don't mind my asking.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.272
That's not information
we're at liberty to share.

43:34.070 --> 43:36.607
Because a fresh corpse...

43:37.741 --> 43:39.857
...full of blood....

43:41.536 --> 43:45.620
Detective, that's something
no vampire could resist.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.328
I daresay not even I.

43:49.044 --> 43:53.458
-Good thing you weren't there.
-And nor was any other vampire.

43:53.632 --> 43:57.375
A vampire would have drained those girls
of every last drop.

43:58.220 --> 43:59.460
How's your Fresca?

44:02.057 --> 44:05.299
-It's a little warm.
-I apologize.

44:05.477 --> 44:06.887
I don't own a refrigerator.

44:11.024 --> 44:14.892
-Oh, shoot. I think I forgot my pen.
-Leaveit

44:59.614 --> 45:01.775
Is there anyone inside?

45:02.784 --> 45:04.945
I require help.

45:06.872 --> 45:10.330
I'm a soldier
with the 28th Louisiana Infantry.

45:11.001 --> 45:12.787
I require food and water.

45:13.670 --> 45:16.002
Is there anyone who can help me?

45:31.354 --> 45:35.222
Do not move. I will shoot you.

45:37.652 --> 45:40.735
I wasn't even aware we surrendered.

45:41.531 --> 45:45.615
Word came two weeks ago.
Yeah. We disbanded immediately.

45:45.785 --> 45:48.401
Most of the men marched back
to Monroe...

45:48.580 --> 45:52.619
...but I chose to take a shortcut home
by way of these trails.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.657
I overestimated my knowledge
of the land.

45:56.588 --> 45:58.795
You're not far off.

46:00.675 --> 46:03.337
The lake is 10 miles southwest of here...

46:03.511 --> 46:06.674
...and Bon Temps
is 10 miles south of that.

46:11.811 --> 46:16.680
My husband was in the 13th Infantry,
under Colonel Gibson.

46:16.858 --> 46:17.973
He fought at Shiloh.

46:21.321 --> 46:23.312
He used to write to me
every few weeks...

46:23.490 --> 46:26.823
...but I haven't heard from him
in nearly seven months.

46:29.454 --> 46:32.867
Many of the postal routes
have been disrupted.

46:33.041 --> 46:37.626
-I'm sure your letter simply got lost.
-That's kind of you.

46:37.796 --> 46:41.459
But I've considered myself a widow
for some time now.

46:47.555 --> 46:51.764
You still have quite a lot of blood on you.

47:02.904 --> 47:05.566
You're a lucky man, lieutenant.

47:06.074 --> 47:09.237
I doubt you would've survived another day
without food.

47:11.204 --> 47:14.071
I'm in debt to you for taking pity on me.

47:16.292 --> 47:18.078
Ithink...

47:18.920 --> 47:20.421
...for your sake...

47:22.924 --> 47:25.415
...you'd best spend the night here...

47:26.761 --> 47:28.467
...with me.

47:29.848 --> 47:32.339
|'m-- I'm sorry.

47:34.811 --> 47:37.598
I apologize if I misled you.

47:40.108 --> 47:43.020
But I have a wife
and two small children waiting for me.

47:43.194 --> 47:47.107
And if Bon Temps is close,
as you say it is, then I'll see them soon...

47:47.282 --> 47:50.399
...and I do not wish to sully our reunion.

47:51.911 --> 47:54.368
You are an honorable man.

47:55.081 --> 47:58.448
-The others have not always been so.
-There's been others?

47:59.419 --> 48:01.284
From time to time.

48:01.463 --> 48:03.954
Deserters, mostly.

48:04.132 --> 48:08.626
I offered them a crust of bread
and a place to rest...

48:09.262 --> 48:12.004
...and they would help
appease my loneliness.

48:12.724 --> 48:15.431
It may not be moral, lieutenant...

48:15.977 --> 48:18.468
...but these are times of war.

48:25.028 --> 48:27.314
I do notjudge you.

48:27.489 --> 48:29.445
Your choices are your own, as are mine.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.742
I wish to continue on my way home.

48:36.664 --> 48:39.656
You have my gratitude
for your hospitality.

48:39.834 --> 48:42.086
I will not soon forget it.

49:41.396 --> 49:43.227
The others.

49:45.233 --> 49:48.566
They all presented themselves
as gentlemen.

49:49.070 --> 49:51.686
You can blame the war if you like.

49:51.865 --> 49:56.905
They proved to be no more than savages
once I let them into my home.

49:57.287 --> 49:59.243
They deserved no better.

50:06.296 --> 50:08.412
Have I died?

50:08.590 --> 50:10.876
Oh, yes.

50:13.261 --> 50:15.593
But I'm not keen
to let you go quite so easily.

50:15.972 --> 50:20.090
I've waited a long time
for a man such as you.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.428
Drink.

50:27.692 --> 50:30.183
If you do not drink, you will die...

50:30.361 --> 50:32.522
...certain as I'm speaking to you
right now.

50:33.156 --> 50:36.114
Do you wish to see your family again?

50:36.284 --> 50:39.776
Your wife, your children?

50:45.960 --> 50:48.622
You must drink from me.

50:54.302 --> 50:58.796
Take me in you. Feel me in you.

50:59.140 --> 51:02.883
We are together, William, forever.

51:03.061 --> 51:06.599
You are mine.

51:24.874 --> 51:26.159
Look.

51:27.627 --> 51:31.245
-What do you see?
-You know you can never enter.

51:34.175 --> 51:36.882
Do you wish to see them grow old?

51:37.053 --> 51:40.011
Grow feeble and die...

51:40.515 --> 51:44.133
...while you remain the same
year after year?

51:44.310 --> 51:46.016
They are my family.

51:46.187 --> 51:48.644
They are as good as dead...

51:48.815 --> 51:52.399
...if they are found harboring a vampire.

51:56.322 --> 51:58.699
I've brought you here...

51:58.866 --> 52:01.573
...and now it's time for us to go.

52:05.957 --> 52:07.697
Come.

52:44.203 --> 52:46.159
You've gotta be kidding me.

52:48.041 --> 52:51.909
Oh, hey. Hey, Tara. This is Randi Sue.

52:53.671 --> 52:57.584
Come join us. It's beautiful.

52:59.677 --> 53:01.668
Fuck you, Stackhouse.

53:01.846 --> 53:06.180
Bitch! No one fucks with my hair.

53:07.352 --> 53:10.890
Don't you dare stop.
