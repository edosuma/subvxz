WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.487
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.625 --> 00:07.352
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.490 --> 00:12.046
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.184 --> 00:14.980
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.118 --> 00:17.879
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.018 --> 00:21.814
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.678 --> 00:26.095
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.233 --> 00:28.787
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.925 --> 00:31.341
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.479 --> 00:34.103
Just to get up that hill

00:34.241 --> 00:36.622
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.760 --> 00:39.211
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.349 --> 00:41.696
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.834 --> 00:43.422
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.560 --> 00:46.184
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.322 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:53.777
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.915 --> 00:56.642
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.780 --> 00:59.645
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.783 --> 01:06.204
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:13.211 --> 01:17.111
Hey, hey, Weez! Break out
the good champagne!
It's been one hell of a day!

01:17.249 --> 01:19.079
Oh, hi, George.

01:19.217 --> 01:25.637
She spreads her beauty
like the dawn, with a trail
of angels at her feet.

01:25.775 --> 01:29.848
Oh, that's so romantic.
Did you make that up?

01:29.986 --> 01:32.437
Nah... Somebody
spray-painted it
on the subway!

01:34.370 --> 01:37.304
But, it's true.
Weezy, guess what?

01:37.442 --> 01:38.995
After six months,
I finally did it!

01:39.616 --> 01:41.204
Did what?

01:41.342 --> 01:44.207
Don't you ever listen to me?
It's all I've been
talking about.

01:44.345 --> 01:46.727
What's the last thing I said
before we went to bed
last night?

01:46.865 --> 01:49.005
"Not tonight, Weezy,
I'm too tired."

01:52.042 --> 01:55.253
Hey, Florence!
Good to see ya!
How's my favorite maid?

01:56.875 --> 01:58.118
What's wrong with him?

01:59.326 --> 02:00.844
Nothing.

02:00.982 --> 02:03.364
Haven't you ever seen
Mr. Jefferson in a good
mood before?

02:03.502 --> 02:05.953
No, but don't go by me.
I've only worked here
two years.

02:07.713 --> 02:10.578
You can't get to me today,
Florence.

02:10.716 --> 02:13.133
Mrs. Jefferson, Lionel and
Jenny will be coming soon.

02:13.271 --> 02:14.479
Don't you want me to start
the hors d'oeuvres?

02:14.617 --> 02:15.549
No! Hold it!

02:16.895 --> 02:19.760
These are the hors d'oeuvres.
Real fancy French ones.

02:19.898 --> 02:21.624
Just stick 'em
on a plate.

02:21.762 --> 02:24.489
You went out and bought
hors d'oeuvres?
I was gonna make 'em myself.

02:24.627 --> 02:26.353
I know. That's why
I went out and bought 'em.

02:28.424 --> 02:32.013
Okay, but I was gonna
fix something special
just for you.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.257
I call it
"My George Jefferson
Sandwich."

02:34.395 --> 02:35.603
Oh, yeah? What is it?

02:35.741 --> 02:37.087
Shrimp, wrapped in tongue!

02:44.647 --> 02:48.927
Well, come on, George,
tell me why you're in
such a good mood.

02:49.065 --> 02:51.136
Well, Weezy,
I finally did it.

02:51.274 --> 02:54.657
Oh, that must be the kids.
You can tell us all at once.

02:57.038 --> 03:01.146
It's them! Jenny!
Oh, Lionel!

03:01.284 --> 03:02.458
GEORGE: Hey...

03:02.596 --> 03:04.529
Lionel! You're just in time
for the big news.

03:04.667 --> 03:05.978
Oh, yeah?
What's up, Pop?

03:06.116 --> 03:07.980
My business, that's what.

03:08.118 --> 03:10.293
You know that account
I've been trying to land
for the last six months?

03:10.431 --> 03:12.192
That big hotel owned
by that French dude?

03:12.330 --> 03:14.090
You mean
the Moulin Rouge?

03:14.228 --> 03:18.267
That's right. But from now on
I am going to be cleaning
all of the Rouge

03:18.405 --> 03:19.751
off of their Moulins!

03:22.132 --> 03:24.549
I'm so proud of you.
I told ya.

03:24.687 --> 03:27.137
That's wonderful,
Mr. Jefferson!
Here's to your new job!

03:28.208 --> 03:30.002
And here's
to my old one!

03:32.453 --> 03:34.697
Your old one?
What do you mean?

03:34.835 --> 03:36.423
Oh, I got laid off today.

03:36.561 --> 03:39.495
Laid off?
How did they do that?
It's illegal!

03:39.633 --> 03:41.048
Why?
'Cause you're my son!

03:43.015 --> 03:45.639
I don't think they took that
into consideration,
Mr. Jefferson.

03:45.777 --> 03:47.986
Well, didn't you tell them
about your four
starving kids at home?

03:48.435 --> 03:50.057
Pop! That's a lie!

03:50.195 --> 03:52.749
No, it's not. If you
had four kids, they'd
be starving right now!

03:54.475 --> 03:58.168
Say, look... The contract
I was working on just
ran out, that's all.

03:58.307 --> 04:01.068
But how are you gonna
support yourselves?

04:01.206 --> 04:05.003
Hey, it's not that bad.
We have a savings
account, you know.

04:05.141 --> 04:07.281
And how long
is that gonna last?

04:07.419 --> 04:10.111
If we really cut down?
Eight or nine hours.

04:13.460 --> 04:17.360
Hey, Mom, don't worry now.
It's probably just temporary.

04:17.498 --> 04:19.742
And besides, I can always
quit school and get a job.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.332
Ha! You support Lionel?

04:23.470 --> 04:25.748
Yeah. What's wrong
with a wife helping out?

04:25.886 --> 04:27.508
Mrs. Jefferson,
she helped you.

04:27.646 --> 04:30.580
That's different.
Weezy has a natural
talent for doing laundry.

04:30.718 --> 04:31.719
What?

04:33.549 --> 04:35.136
Oh, no,
that came out wrong, Weez.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.485
What I mean is, uh,
you really shine when
you're around dirt!

04:42.178 --> 04:45.215
Keep talking, George,
and you'll be under
six feet of it!

04:46.734 --> 04:50.669
Hey now, look.
Jenny could help out, but
she's not gonna have to.

04:50.807 --> 04:52.499
I can just
get another job.

04:52.637 --> 04:55.433
You can? Hey, that's right.
And I know where, too.

04:55.571 --> 04:57.158
Where, Pop?
With me.

04:57.814 --> 04:58.781
With you?

04:58.919 --> 05:00.058
Why not?
I mean, it's perfect.

05:00.196 --> 05:02.509
I mean, good hours,
good pay,

05:02.647 --> 05:04.545
and a boss who'll be
just like a father to you.

05:06.582 --> 05:08.929
You know, it's not
a bad idea, Lionel.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.311
After all, it would
only be temporary,

05:11.449 --> 05:13.347
and you could make enough
to tide yourself over.

05:13.485 --> 05:16.143
Right! And, besides,
you used to work for me
in the summer at the store.

05:16.281 --> 05:17.696
I mean, you know what
I'm like to work with.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.388
Don't blow it, George.

05:20.527 --> 05:21.942
Oh, Weezy!

05:22.080 --> 05:23.392
So, what do
you say, son?

05:23.530 --> 05:26.602
Uh, careful, Lionel.
Your father might say
it's temporary,

05:26.740 --> 05:28.397
but you know how much
he wants to get you
in that business.

05:28.535 --> 05:30.985
Jenny, I'm shocked!

05:31.123 --> 05:34.264
What makes you think
Mr. Jefferson would ever
tell a lie?

05:34.403 --> 05:37.198
I don't know.
Maybe I heard it from
my four starving kids.

05:38.993 --> 05:42.894
Come on, Jenny,
he's only trying
to help, and...

05:43.032 --> 05:45.241
Well, I've worked behind
the counter before.
I know the job.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.656
Good!
Then it's all settled!

05:48.313 --> 05:50.936
Well, okay.
And thanks, Pop.

05:51.074 --> 05:52.213
But you better
remember something.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.939
If an engineering job
comes up...

05:54.077 --> 05:58.323
Sure, sure! But, meanwhile,
you'll work for me in my
corporate headquarters,

05:58.461 --> 05:59.876
as my new Vice President.

06:00.014 --> 06:03.017
Oh! Hold it! A temporary
vice president?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.398
Hey, now, wait a minute.

06:04.536 --> 06:05.641
I thought I was
gonna be working

06:05.779 --> 06:07.332
in one of your stores,
behind the counter.

06:07.470 --> 06:09.610
All those jobs are taken.
What do you want me
to do?

06:09.748 --> 06:12.061
Fire one of them poor guys
just to make room for you?

06:14.028 --> 06:15.098
Of course not.

06:15.236 --> 06:16.548
Then you've got to be
Vice President.

06:16.686 --> 06:18.516
It's the only job
that's open!

06:18.654 --> 06:21.864
Yeah, but, Vice President?
You know I don't have
any experience for that!

06:22.002 --> 06:23.935
What are you talking about?
Your name's Jefferson,
ain't it?

06:24.073 --> 06:25.523
You got cleaning fluid
in your blood!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.837
I think you got some
in these hors d'oeuvres
you brought home, too!

06:30.942 --> 06:32.737
What are they, Florence?

06:32.875 --> 06:35.671
Beats me. Little green things
over here and little black
things over there.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.296
What are those little
brown things on top?

06:40.434 --> 06:42.402
If they ain't moving,
they're probably anchovies.

06:46.267 --> 06:49.305
Well, no, thanks, Florence.
Maybe later.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.720
I wouldn't wait
too long, child.

06:50.858 --> 06:52.446
Lord knows what happens
when they get old!

06:55.863 --> 06:57.555
Look, Florence,
I'm starving to death.

06:57.693 --> 07:00.350
Now, will you get rid
of that mess and start
serving dinner?

07:00.489 --> 07:02.663
We'll help you, Florence.
Come on, baby.

07:05.148 --> 07:09.152
Oh, George, isn't this nice
the way everything
worked out?

07:09.290 --> 07:12.190
Lionel working for
you temporarily.

07:12.328 --> 07:14.951
Temporarily?
I got news for you, Weezy.

07:15.089 --> 07:17.402
He is going to work
for me permanently.

07:17.540 --> 07:20.957
It's finally gonna be
"Jefferson and Son."

07:21.095 --> 07:25.272
Don't you ever give up?
Lionel doesn't want
to work for you permanently.

07:25.410 --> 07:28.033
He will. Psychology, Weez.

07:28.171 --> 07:31.589
Look, when a man
gets a job behind a big desk,
making important decisions,

07:31.727 --> 07:34.350
all of a sudden
he's 10 feet tall.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.218
How come it didn't
work for you?

07:44.533 --> 07:46.155
Then the supplies
are on their way?

07:46.293 --> 07:48.640
Oh, good.
Thank you, yeah.
Bye-bye.

07:50.539 --> 07:51.988
Hey, Lionel,
how's it goin'?

07:52.126 --> 07:53.403
Oh, great, Pop!

07:54.232 --> 07:56.372
Hey, you know something?

07:57.822 --> 08:00.410
I've been working with you
for the past week now.

08:00.549 --> 08:02.620
You've been really easy
to get along with.

08:02.758 --> 08:04.311
You don't question
any of my decisions,

08:04.449 --> 08:05.933
you say yes
to everything I do,

08:06.071 --> 08:09.178
you haven't argued
with me once.
Hey, Pop, are you okay?

08:09.316 --> 08:12.664
Why should
I question your decisions?
I told you, you're the boss.

08:12.802 --> 08:14.252
If you say something's right,
it's right.

08:15.391 --> 08:17.807
Mr. Jefferson, all the stores
just called in.

08:17.945 --> 08:20.361
They said they delivered
the new furniture
and it's beautiful.

08:22.571 --> 08:24.504
What new furniture?
Who the hell ordered
new furniture?

08:24.642 --> 08:25.815
I did.

08:25.953 --> 08:30.371
Another great decision!

08:30.510 --> 08:31.718
New furniture!

08:34.306 --> 08:35.791
Why?

08:35.929 --> 08:37.862
Well, I thought the customers
would like someplace to sit,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.588
you know, while they're
waiting for their clothes.

08:39.726 --> 08:42.556
Of course! Now, see,
that's using your head!
What a great idea!

08:43.384 --> 08:44.696
How much did it cost?

08:44.834 --> 08:47.285
Oh, don't worry
about that, Pop.
I got a great deal.

08:47.423 --> 08:50.460
Normally, it would
cost us $1700.

08:51.116 --> 08:52.635
$1700?

08:52.773 --> 08:55.914
Don't worry, Pop,
I got a great deal.
It only ran us...

08:56.432 --> 08:57.467
$1300.

08:57.606 --> 08:59.918
Oh, only $1300!

09:00.056 --> 09:03.094
For each store.
For each store?

09:03.232 --> 09:05.199
Well, I... Did I do
something wrong, Pop?

09:05.337 --> 09:08.824
No, no, no, no... I was just
wondering why I never
thought of that!

09:08.962 --> 09:11.585
Well, you know, you probably
just didn't know where
to get a good deal.

09:11.723 --> 09:13.276
Oh, you might
be right, Lionel!

09:13.414 --> 09:15.175
Oh, Pop, I want you
to wait here.

09:15.313 --> 09:17.142
I want to bring in
something and show it to you.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.799
Hey! You're the boss!

09:18.937 --> 09:20.663
You know something?
I think you're really
gonna like this.

09:20.801 --> 09:23.217
Oh, better than
the furniture?
Oh, man, a lot better.

09:24.322 --> 09:26.117
I don't think so!

09:28.084 --> 09:31.501
Hello? Oh, Mr. Simmons!
Hey, how's the restaurant
business treating you?

09:33.124 --> 09:34.608
What do you mean,
what happened
to your laundry?

09:34.746 --> 09:35.920
You know it always
takes a week.

09:37.438 --> 09:38.923
Who told you
we had one-day service?

09:40.234 --> 09:41.719
Lionel Jefferson?

09:41.857 --> 09:42.961
No, I never heard of him!

09:44.480 --> 09:46.378
He said he was my son?

09:47.863 --> 09:50.003
That's impossible.
My son's in Alaska.

09:51.901 --> 09:55.525
No, no, Simmons, don't
worry about it. I'll take
care of it. Okay, bye.

09:55.664 --> 09:57.010
That Lionel is hopeless!

09:59.012 --> 10:00.565
Well, what do you think?

10:02.291 --> 10:03.913
Well...

10:04.051 --> 10:06.640
Oh! It says
"Jefferson Cleaners."

10:06.778 --> 10:09.470
You see, Lionel,
a little patch like that
is good advertising.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.403
You see, that's what
I thought, too, Pop.

10:11.541 --> 10:14.372
So, I went ahead and
got one for every employee.
You know, in all the stores.

10:14.510 --> 10:16.857
That's great. Now, I mean,
how much could a bunch
of patches like that cost?

10:16.995 --> 10:18.859
Hey, man, this didn't
cost nothing.

10:18.997 --> 10:21.344
They threw 'em in for free
when I bought the blazers!

10:23.830 --> 10:25.832
You bought blazers
for all the employees?

10:25.970 --> 10:30.008
Well, yeah, I thought
it would give the stores
some class.

10:30.146 --> 10:32.321
Oh, about $2000
worth of class!

10:32.459 --> 10:33.771
Oh, no. $3000!

10:33.909 --> 10:37.222
Oh! I mean, who can
put a price tag on class?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.535
Now, see, I knew you would
appreciate that.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.812
And, look,
while you got a minute,

10:40.950 --> 10:42.055
I made one more decision.

10:42.193 --> 10:43.573
Oh, let me sit down
for this one.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.336
Okay, go ahead.

10:47.474 --> 10:50.132
I decided to get all
the stores painted.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.175
You decided to get
all the stores painted!

10:59.313 --> 11:01.833
Don't worry, man. It won't
interfere with business.

11:01.971 --> 11:05.285
I'm having the painters
come in on Sunday when
all the stores are closed.

11:05.423 --> 11:06.389
Lionel, don't you know
that painters

11:06.527 --> 11:08.012
get double time for Sundays?

11:09.254 --> 11:11.015
I didn't think
about that, Pop.

11:11.153 --> 11:12.672
I guess I've made
my first mistake, huh.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.915
No, no, no.
I wouldn't say that!

11:15.053 --> 11:18.056
Now, how much
is this painting gonna cost?

11:18.194 --> 11:20.507
Well, um,
here's the estimate.

11:21.819 --> 11:23.683
Of course, it's only
a ballpark figure.

11:23.821 --> 11:25.167
Yeah. Yankee Stadium!

11:26.202 --> 11:28.032
What did you say?
Uh, nothing, Lionel. Look.

11:28.170 --> 11:29.343
I think I better
run down to the bank.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.517
Oh, you want me
to go with you?

11:30.655 --> 11:31.829
No! You stay away
from the bank!

11:41.977 --> 11:43.737
Oh, hi, George.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.532
Some son you've got!
What?

11:45.670 --> 11:48.155
$1300 for this,
$3000 for that.

11:48.293 --> 11:50.295
I'm lucky he didn't buy
blazers for all the painters!

11:53.643 --> 11:56.992
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about
your son, Lionel!

11:57.130 --> 11:58.303
He's a walking disaster!

11:59.926 --> 12:02.031
I don't think you're being
fair, George.

12:02.169 --> 12:04.482
Lionel's only been
in the business a few days.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.173
Yeah, right. If he's
in it much longer,

12:06.311 --> 12:07.899
there ain't gonna be
no business!

12:08.037 --> 12:10.039
Isn't it possible that
you're just expecting

12:10.177 --> 12:11.178
too much
from him too soon?

12:11.316 --> 12:13.491
Oh, Weezy...
No, I mean it!

12:13.629 --> 12:17.150
Don't forget, you made some
pretty bad mistakes yourself
when you first started.

12:17.288 --> 12:18.496
Oh, yeah? Like what?

12:18.634 --> 12:21.741
Like that first
delivery truck you bought.

12:21.879 --> 12:24.364
Oh, yeah. How was
I supposed to know it had
been used in a hold-up?

12:27.505 --> 12:30.370
The bullet holes
in the back might have
given you a hint!

12:31.681 --> 12:33.269
Yeah, you're right, Weezy.
I should have looked.

12:35.513 --> 12:39.828
You remember the time you
accidentally bleached those
nuns' habits?

12:41.381 --> 12:44.798
Oh, yeah.
Boy, were they mad!

12:44.936 --> 12:46.662
I didn't think nuns even
knew words like that!

12:49.078 --> 12:52.979
And how about the time
the dryers burned out 'cause
you used the wrong fuses?

12:53.117 --> 12:56.292
Now, that was
really dumb.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.537
Okay! You made your point!

13:01.470 --> 13:03.921
Yeah, I guess it takes
a while to learn the ropes.

13:04.059 --> 13:06.199
Oh, Lionel will
straighten out. You'll see.

13:07.407 --> 13:08.649
Yeah, you're probably
right, Weezy.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.445
Now, just relax
and read the paper.

13:12.550 --> 13:15.070
I'll make you another drink.

13:15.208 --> 13:19.177
And look on the bright side,
your ad turned
out beautifully.

13:19.315 --> 13:20.730
Oh, yeah? Well, that's good.

13:22.180 --> 13:24.010
What ad?

13:24.148 --> 13:27.599
Oh, it's right there
on page three. This ad.

13:29.532 --> 13:32.950
"Jefferson Cleaners proudly
announces its Friday
half-price sale!"

13:33.088 --> 13:34.399
Who the hell
put this in here?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.298
Didn't you?

13:36.436 --> 13:39.197
Are you crazy, Weezy?
A half-price sale
in all my stores

13:39.335 --> 13:40.750
could run me
out of business!

13:40.889 --> 13:43.684
Well, if you didn't do it,
who did?

13:44.340 --> 13:45.514
BOTH: Lionel!

13:56.145 --> 13:57.733
What do you
want me to do?

13:57.871 --> 13:59.562
Well, use your
own judgment!

13:59.700 --> 14:01.254
No! Don't put 'em
on overtime!

14:01.392 --> 14:03.221
They'll be getting
double paid taking in
half-priced laundry!

14:05.499 --> 14:06.984
Yeah? What is it?

14:07.122 --> 14:08.951
Mr. Jefferson!
I have the Bronx store
on the other line!

14:09.089 --> 14:11.367
Someone just
dropped off a ton
and a half of laundry!

14:11.505 --> 14:12.817
Lionel's ad
is gonna ruin me!

14:12.955 --> 14:14.750
Every cleaner in town
is sending me their work!

14:14.888 --> 14:16.476
What do you want me
to tell the manager
in the Bronx?

14:16.614 --> 14:18.098
He's practically crying!

14:18.236 --> 14:19.548
Tell him to come on
over here and we can
cry together!

14:22.723 --> 14:24.553
Yeah, what is it?

14:24.691 --> 14:28.074
Hello.
Wong Sung Fat's Hand Laundry.
No speak English.

14:28.212 --> 14:29.523
Call back, me learn how!

14:35.322 --> 14:38.532
Hi, George. I thought maybe
you'd like to go out
to lunch today.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.706
Great, Weezy.

14:39.844 --> 14:42.191
Why don't you get us
a table for two in Brazil!

14:42.329 --> 14:44.642
Mr. Jefferson!
I got a mean dude
on the line in there!

14:44.780 --> 14:48.784
He's laughing his head off
and saying you're the dumbest
businessman he's ever seen!

14:48.922 --> 14:51.511
Oh, yeah? Who is it?
Your accountant!

14:53.237 --> 14:54.859
Uh, George,
what about lunch?

14:54.997 --> 14:56.516
Not now, Weezy!
Answer the phone!

14:56.654 --> 14:58.000
Huh?
Grab the phone!

14:58.138 --> 15:00.071
What'll I say?
Say "hello"!

15:01.210 --> 15:03.799
Hello. What?
Oh, you're from
the newspaper?

15:03.937 --> 15:06.215
Yeah. No, I don't want
to run the ad again
next week!

15:07.665 --> 15:12.118
Okay, I'll tell him.
George, that was your
manager in Queens.

15:12.256 --> 15:14.775
He said when
he called before he forgot
to tell you something.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.777
What?

15:18.745 --> 15:20.540
George, what's going
on here?

15:20.678 --> 15:22.231
Look, Weezy,
just grab the phone!

15:24.199 --> 15:26.132
Hello? What do you want?
Jefferson Cleaners.

15:26.270 --> 15:28.686
I know
this is Jefferson Cleaners!
What do you want?

15:28.824 --> 15:30.722
Uh...
I don't want anything!

15:30.860 --> 15:32.207
Well, then, get the hell
off my phone!

15:37.764 --> 15:40.491
Listen, buster,
nobody talks to me
like that!

15:40.629 --> 15:42.493
Oh, yeah, well,
you listen here, mister...

15:42.631 --> 15:43.943
Mister?

15:46.186 --> 15:48.637
George?
What?

15:51.847 --> 15:53.918
George?
Hi, Weez.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.993
"Mister," huh?

16:00.131 --> 16:01.857
Look, I'm sorry, Weezy.
I didn't know it was you!

16:01.995 --> 16:04.998
Look, that ad Lionel put
in the paper is the cause
of all of this.

16:05.136 --> 16:07.069
Hi, Pop. Hey, Mom.
How you doin'?

16:07.207 --> 16:10.141
Oh, Lionel! We were just
talking about you!

16:10.279 --> 16:12.385
Oh, yeah. Oh, I went by
all the stores

16:12.523 --> 16:14.663
and you should see
all the business
we're getting.

16:14.801 --> 16:16.976
Yeah, we're getting
the business, all right.

16:17.114 --> 16:23.396
Uh, Lionel, are you sure
putting that ad in the paper
was the right thing to do?

16:23.534 --> 16:27.745
Are you kidding? We couldn't
buy publicity like that
for a million dollars.

16:27.883 --> 16:30.403
I think we just did.

16:30.541 --> 16:34.165
Well, if you two
want to talk,
I'm going shopping.

16:34.303 --> 16:36.443
Oh, yeah, see you
later, Weez.
Yeah, have a good time, Mom.

16:37.686 --> 16:40.206
Uh, Lionel...
Sorry, Pop. I gotta get
these bills out.

16:40.344 --> 16:42.587
Uh, before you
do that Lionel, uh...

16:42.725 --> 16:44.796
Look, I've been doing
a lot of thinking, and, um...

16:44.934 --> 16:46.729
You've been working here
almost a week now,

16:46.867 --> 16:48.869
and, like,
you've really got things
turned around here.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.114
Oh, Pop, thank you.
I'm glad I'm working out.

16:52.252 --> 16:55.876
Uh, yeah. So, um... Well,
I figured you were about
due for a vacation!

16:56.015 --> 16:57.016
A what?

16:58.914 --> 17:00.467
You know, paid of course.

17:00.605 --> 17:02.228
A vacation?

17:02.366 --> 17:04.126
Yeah, well, at least
two or three months!

17:04.264 --> 17:06.094
Uh-uh,
we're too busy now.

17:06.232 --> 17:07.957
I mean, there's too much
to get finished.

17:08.096 --> 17:12.445
That's the word that keeps
popping in my head.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.482
Look, Pop.
We're too busy right now!
I better skip that vacation.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.553
But, Lionel, look.
I don't want you
to be overworked.

17:17.691 --> 17:19.866
I want you to stay fresh,

17:20.004 --> 17:22.972
so you can keep coming up
with those...
Those great ideas.

17:23.111 --> 17:26.873
Oh, so that's it.
Hey, look, you don't have
to worry about that,

17:27.011 --> 17:29.117
because I got a lot
of great ideas left.

17:29.255 --> 17:32.948
Oh, you do? You know
something, Lionel,
you're unbelievable.

17:34.363 --> 17:36.124
Hey, Pop, you don't
have to thank me.

17:36.262 --> 17:37.711
After all,
what are sons for?

17:37.849 --> 17:39.610
That's what I'm beginning
to wonder.

17:41.750 --> 17:44.925
Hello? Who?
Oh, yeah, he's here.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.687
Hold on.

17:47.825 --> 17:49.792
It's your boss from
the old engineering company.

17:52.485 --> 17:53.658
Hello, Mr. Hoffman...

17:55.074 --> 17:57.662
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.975
Hey, well, sure,
I'd like to meet with you.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.391
That sounds great.

18:02.529 --> 18:06.188
Today for lunch will be fine.
Okay. Yeah, bye.

18:09.295 --> 18:10.951
Well, what did he say?

18:11.090 --> 18:14.472
You'll never guess, Pop.
Those people want to
give me my old job back!

18:14.610 --> 18:15.922
Really?

18:16.923 --> 18:18.166
I mean, really?

18:20.340 --> 18:24.275
Yeah, I really don't know
what to do because
I like the job.

18:24.413 --> 18:28.072
Well, then, go take it.
I mean, I'll miss you
around here

18:28.866 --> 18:30.143
but I'll make out
somehow.

18:30.281 --> 18:31.800
Well, I am
an engineer, you know.

18:31.938 --> 18:35.459
I know, you got to go
with your profession.
Oh, don't get me wrong,

18:35.597 --> 18:36.805
you did a great job here.

18:38.496 --> 18:40.809
But, Pop, you can
find someone to take
my place, can't you?

18:40.947 --> 18:43.122
I don't think so, Lionel.

18:45.710 --> 18:48.541
I don't think there's anybody
in the cleaning business
like you.

18:50.474 --> 18:53.408
Well, thanks, Pop.
That's all I needed to know.

18:53.546 --> 18:54.685
Where you going?

18:54.823 --> 18:55.893
Oh, I'm going to have
lunch with Mr. Hoffman

18:56.031 --> 18:57.343
and tell him that
I can't take the job.

18:57.481 --> 18:59.655
Hey, but, Lionel!
Hey, Pop, you need
me here, man.

18:59.793 --> 19:03.383
Hey! Come here!
Lionel, I didn't mean that.
Lionel!

19:13.255 --> 19:16.051
George, will you please
stop walking around?

19:16.189 --> 19:19.434
You make me feel like
I'm eating in a bus depot.

19:19.572 --> 19:21.919
I can't help it, Weezy.
I don't know what to do
about Lionel?

19:22.057 --> 19:24.473
I mean, he means well,
but he's ruining
my business.

19:24.611 --> 19:27.304
Oh, you don't think
Jefferson and Son is
gonna work out, huh?

19:27.442 --> 19:30.445
Oh, no,
the Jefferson is cool,
it's the son that's gotta go!

19:32.378 --> 19:33.793
Here's your coffee.

19:33.931 --> 19:35.346
Where's the cream
and sugar?

19:35.484 --> 19:37.141
Where it always is.
In the kitchen.

19:40.420 --> 19:42.871
It really
isn't Lionel's fault.

19:43.009 --> 19:45.563
He's an engineer.
He never wanted
to be a businessman.

19:45.701 --> 19:47.116
That's right,
that's why I don't know
where you got

19:47.255 --> 19:49.912
the stupid idea that
he should work for me.

19:50.050 --> 19:54.054
My idea? Uh-uh, you're not
gonna pin this one on me.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.746
She's right.
It was your stupid idea.

19:57.437 --> 20:00.578
Well, look, it don't matter
whose stupid idea it was.

20:01.303 --> 20:02.994
The fact is, he's our son,

20:03.132 --> 20:04.410
he's screwing up
our business,

20:04.548 --> 20:06.101
and we gotta
work it out together.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.447
But what can we do?

20:08.414 --> 20:09.794
Well, you'll just
have to fire him!

20:11.934 --> 20:15.352
Me? What happened
to doing it together?

20:15.490 --> 20:18.527
We are doing it together.
I hired him... You fire him!

20:20.909 --> 20:22.013
Why don't you do it?

20:22.945 --> 20:24.223
'Cause you're his mother!

20:25.327 --> 20:26.880
You're his father!

20:27.433 --> 20:28.572
You had him.

20:31.402 --> 20:32.748
You made him!

20:39.307 --> 20:40.687
I used to pick up
after him!

20:44.035 --> 20:47.176
Florence, ain't you got
something better to do
than just sitting here?

20:47.315 --> 20:48.902
I don't know.
Make me an offer.

20:50.456 --> 20:52.389
Well, why don't you try
washing the dishes?

20:52.527 --> 20:53.873
That ain't better
than sitting here.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.256
Florence.

20:59.637 --> 21:01.881
You all always talking about
I'm part of the family.

21:05.436 --> 21:10.407
Look, George, you got
yourself into this mess.
Now you get yourself out.

21:10.545 --> 21:11.891
GEORGE: Yeah, but how?

21:12.029 --> 21:13.927
By telling him the truth.

21:15.446 --> 21:17.931
Yeah, that's right.
I mean, this is business.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.313
I'm a man, he's a man,
we're supposed to know
how to handle business.

21:20.451 --> 21:22.315
I'll just lay it
on the line. Sure.

21:23.005 --> 21:24.386
What are you doing?

21:24.524 --> 21:25.560
I'm gonna write
him a letter!

21:27.631 --> 21:29.702
You are doing
nothing of the kind.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.049
You're gonna talk to him
face to face.

21:32.187 --> 21:33.878
But, Weezy,
how can I tell him?

21:35.915 --> 21:37.951
Yeah, but, Jenny,
how can I tell him?

21:38.089 --> 21:42.646
It's simple. You got
the opportunity to work
on a special project,

21:42.784 --> 21:44.510
and you couldn't turn
Mr. Hoffman down.

21:44.648 --> 21:46.753
Mmm-mmm.
Well, what's wrong with that?

21:46.891 --> 21:48.617
I just can't hurt Pop
like that.

21:48.755 --> 21:51.033
You know, you should've
heard him when I told him
I might be leaving.

21:51.171 --> 21:54.036
Oh, Lionel,
you love engineering.

21:54.174 --> 21:56.591
Any reasonable person
will understand that.

21:56.729 --> 21:58.938
Yeah, but, sweetheart,
we're not talking about
a reasonable person.

22:00.042 --> 22:01.147
We're talking
about my father!

22:02.424 --> 22:03.632
Yeah, I forgot.

22:05.047 --> 22:07.187
Well, it's gotta
be done anyway.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.982
Yeah, well,
it isn't gonna be easy.

22:11.640 --> 22:14.643
Oh, Lionel! Jenny!
What a nice surprise!

22:14.781 --> 22:15.817
Hi, Mom.

22:15.955 --> 22:17.059
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson.

22:17.197 --> 22:18.613
Well, come on in.

22:18.751 --> 22:20.615
George, look who's here.

22:20.753 --> 22:23.652
Oh, hey, kids. How you doing?
There's nothing wrong with
the stores, is there?

22:23.790 --> 22:25.033
No, everything's fine.

22:25.171 --> 22:26.379
You didn't sell
one of 'em, did you?

22:29.658 --> 22:31.350
Why would I do
something like that?

22:31.488 --> 22:34.629
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you ran out of paint
or blazers or something.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.496
No, we only dropped by
because Lionel has got
something to tell you.

22:39.634 --> 22:43.120
Oh, that's a coincidence.
George has something
to tell Lionel.

22:43.258 --> 22:44.397
Oh, you do?
What is it?

22:44.535 --> 22:46.537
Nothing that can't wait.
You go first.

22:46.675 --> 22:47.987
Oh, go ahead, Lionel.

22:50.507 --> 22:54.027
Okay, Pop, I'm gonna
get right to the point.
I...

22:54.476 --> 22:55.857
Um...

22:55.995 --> 22:58.169
Yeah, that's right, Lionel.
Right to the point!

22:58.307 --> 23:00.862
Well, woman, I can't talk
if you keep interrupting me!

23:03.520 --> 23:05.487
You see, you made
me forget where I was.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.627
Somewhere between
"I" and "Uh".

23:11.148 --> 23:13.012
Go on, son. What is it?

23:14.047 --> 23:15.428
Lionel! Just tell him!

23:16.602 --> 23:18.397
Pop, I want to
tell you something.

23:19.950 --> 23:21.192
I like working with you!

23:22.193 --> 23:23.885
Okay, George,
it's your turn.

23:27.578 --> 23:29.511
Lionel...
Yeah?

23:29.649 --> 23:32.100
I like working with you, too!
See you in the morning!

23:32.238 --> 23:34.378
Good. 7:30 sharp!

23:34.516 --> 23:36.345
LOUISE: Wait a minute!

23:36.484 --> 23:39.383
George, you've got something
to say, now say it!

23:39.521 --> 23:40.902
And so have you, Lionel.

23:44.077 --> 23:45.872
Lionel.
Pop.

23:46.666 --> 23:47.874
Lionel!
Pop!

23:48.012 --> 23:49.531
You're fired!
He quits!

23:58.160 --> 23:59.334
I'm fired?

23:59.472 --> 24:00.853
You quit?

24:00.991 --> 24:03.269
But, Pop, you told me
I was doing such
a great job!

24:03.407 --> 24:05.513
Well, you told me
you enjoyed working
for me!

24:05.651 --> 24:08.516
Well, what kind of a father
goes around
firing his own son?

24:08.654 --> 24:11.277
A father who has a son
who quits on his own father!

24:13.313 --> 24:15.315
Oh, Pop,
you let me down.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.869
You disappointed
me, Lionel.

24:18.664 --> 24:20.838
And I've never been
happier in my life!

24:49.211 --> 24:52.663
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
