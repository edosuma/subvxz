WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.168
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.252 --> 00:04.838
Some trifling bitch took off
with all your money.

00:04.921 --> 00:06.631
That is not an excuse for you
to be partying

00:06.715 --> 00:07.966
your way to an early grave.

00:08.049 --> 00:10.010
You're not taking care of yourself.

00:10.677 --> 00:11.886
Just need a little time.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.222
I ran the additional test
you asked for.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.266
-Do you have family?
-Yes, but they don't know I'm here.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.726
I think you're gonna need them.

00:23.815 --> 00:27.027
My new technology
will change your world for the better.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.987
All you do is hold your phone.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.699
Now you drop your phone.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.661
You're paying attention. Good.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.204
All you do is breathe.

00:40.999 --> 00:45.128
.02%, which means I had
a shot of liquid courage

00:45.211 --> 00:46.921
before I came out here today.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.799
But I'm also good
to get behind the wheel of a car.

00:52.886 --> 00:57.182
Now, this app won't bring margaritas
to your door

00:57.265 --> 00:59.601
or let you design
and dress your own avatar,

00:59.976 --> 01:02.729
but this technology
could save your life.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.699
Man, you killed it out there.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.451
No need to drown your sorrows.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.535
Why?

01:18.286 --> 01:19.621
I'm in my hotel room.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.331
And if the investors show up?

01:21.998 --> 01:23.083
They won't.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.043
They backed out.

01:25.126 --> 01:29.464
No investors means no money.
The only thing I know for certain is

01:29.547 --> 01:31.800
disloyalty is contagious.

01:31.883 --> 01:35.970
Raymond, maybe you're overcompensating
'cause that woman broke your heart?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.388
Speaking of women...

01:44.104 --> 01:46.022
I don't want to keep them waiting.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.997
Rosie.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.544
I love you.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.300
We love you.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.386
I love you guys, too.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.699
Let me guess. Work?

02:39.576 --> 02:43.496
The killers in this town
do not want us to enjoy our morning.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.259
I...

02:56.801 --> 02:58.261
I got to make a call.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.181
Let me guess. Work?

03:01.264 --> 03:03.433
No. It's not work.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.729
Okay, then. I better get going.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.897
Yeah.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.873
Security guard found the body
during morning rounds.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.750
Raymond Larsen, 32.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.252
CEO of Ray of Light Technology.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.712
This was his office.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.131
Raymond must have been
a master of Zen.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.841
Natural lighting, zero clutter.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.594
-Yeah, no computers or phones either.
-Except for Raymond's.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.888
Could be Ray of Light
was having problems.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.097
Looks like Raymond was, too.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.934
Every combination of alcohol,
desk chair, and noose

03:46.017 --> 03:47.602
spells self-destruction.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.020
Normally I would agree with you, but--

03:49.103 --> 03:51.356
Normally I'd agree
with you, too, but...

03:53.024 --> 03:54.025
we just read the carpet.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.445
Disruption in the fibers, indicating
something heavy was dragged across it.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.656
-Like a body.
-Like a body.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.908
Come take a look
at the back of Raymond's shoes.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.451
Polished to a high shine,

04:03.534 --> 04:05.495
but the rest of the leather
is scuffed.

04:05.578 --> 04:09.123
So either Raymond got distracted
while he was shining his shoes, or...

04:09.207 --> 04:11.542
The carpet cleaned the backs of them
when the killer was...

04:11.918 --> 04:13.211
dragging Raymond's body.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.881
Then hung him and staged the scene
to make it look like a suicide.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.300
If Raymond was
laying off his employees...

04:20.301 --> 04:21.970
plenty of them might want him dead.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.222
I'll start digging into
his company and staff.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.682
I'll get this body back to my lab.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.059
My gut has spoken, and it's telling me
this is a murder.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.188
Okay.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.857
So, you said the killer
tried to make it look like a suicide.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.234
Yeah, and he would have
gotten away with it, too,

04:36.317 --> 04:38.069
if it weren't for those pesky kids.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.321
Scooby Doo was on last night,
the 2002 version.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.406
It's underrated.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.574
You want to tell us
what you just realized?

04:43.658 --> 04:45.702
Or you gonna force us
to force you to talk about it?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.912
Yeah, 'cause we can pull a Rosie, too.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.290
How many things
does "pull a Rosie" refer to?

04:50.373 --> 04:51.541
Twenty-seven.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.169
I'll be back.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.254
-Where are you going?
-Errands.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.464
Mitchie, X-rays. Pippy, full tox.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.966
TMI, swab for DNA.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.718
Make that 28.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.596
Villa, I'm coming to see you.
We need to talk ASAP.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.148
Can we talk?

05:19.360 --> 05:20.361
Get in.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.578
- Where are we going?
- To the EMPD

05:28.661 --> 05:30.496
where they're gonna
lock your ass up for good.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.914
Please,
just let me make my case.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.333
What, that you didn't
steal money from me?

05:33.416 --> 05:35.543
That I didn't kill Raymond Larsen.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.729
Got my partner going through
Raymond's bank accounts right now.

05:54.812 --> 05:57.607
Guessing that she's gonna find
that they were cleaned out, by you,

05:57.690 --> 05:59.817
'cause after me,
Raymond was your next mark.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.986
-How'd you know?
-The picture in Raymond's office.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.196
That ruby ring that you're wearing?

06:03.279 --> 06:04.781
You know, the same ring
that you used to take off

06:04.864 --> 06:07.200
and leave on my kitchen counter
when you did the dishes?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.952
Guess you did the same thing
for him, too.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.663
You had the perfect motive
to kill him.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.874
You stole his money,
he tracked you down

06:14.957 --> 06:16.209
and threatened your freedom.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.627
I know that's what it looks like,

06:17.710 --> 06:19.712
but I promise I didn't kill Raymond,
all right?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.589
I was nowhere around him last night.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.132
Yeah, but you did take his money.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.053
Could you please slow down?
You're scaring me.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.514
Yeah, well, you better talk fast
or talk louder, 'cause, right now

06:29.597 --> 06:31.432
I'm not hearing anything convincing.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.770
Look, I know I've done
some awful things in my life,

06:35.853 --> 06:37.438
some of them to you.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.148
But what I'm not is a killer.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.859
You take me to EMPD,
that's exactly how they'll see me,

06:42.318 --> 06:43.611
because of what I did to you.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.655
And honestly, I don't blame them.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.991
But please believe me when I say
I did not kill Raymond Larsen.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.917
Where are we?

07:03.506 --> 07:04.924
Rosie, my man!

07:05.883 --> 07:07.718
Oh, whoa. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.888
No ladies, sexy or otherwise,
in the man cave.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.015
All right, look, JooJoo,
I have to ask you for an exception.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.268
Oh, she's special?

07:15.351 --> 07:16.561
She's Tawnya.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.400
What's up?

07:23.067 --> 07:24.360
You know I don't judge,

07:24.819 --> 07:27.280
but that woman is
a malignant tumor of cancer death.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.741
Look with your eyes, not your hands.
Thank you.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.743
All right, now, listen.
We need to extract her right now.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.870
I got it.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.288
-You sure?
-I'm positive.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.998
All I need is an ankle monitor.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.708
I don't know nothing
about no ankle monitors.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.001
Really?

07:40.084 --> 07:42.587
Well, I heard everybody else in town
was a waste of my time.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.672
Heard you were honest,
you were fair, you the man.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.048
You got the best merchandise.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.219
This... is your premium.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.515
GPS triangulation with 99.9% accuracy.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.267
Works within a one mile radius.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.852
And those sparkly things?

07:57.935 --> 08:00.354
Let's just say
that those ain't cubic-zirconium.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.606
You know how to put these on?

08:01.689 --> 08:04.192
Would you buy a Bentley
if you didn't know how to drive it?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.320
I'm just gonna go get the tools.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.326
Diamond-encrusted?

08:13.409 --> 08:14.869
Sure you want to leave me alone
with these?

08:14.952 --> 08:17.038
I'm gonna have JooJoo monitor you.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.414
If you go outside the radius,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.958
I'm gonna have the EMPD
put a BOLO on your ass.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.252
And you remember all of our places...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.296
that awful restaurant
where you worked.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.215
My apartment?

08:28.966 --> 08:31.928
The table, the shower...

08:33.095 --> 08:35.181
-The bed.
-The beach.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.433
How could I forget about the beach?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.143
Because you'd have to do what you did.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.479
But I'm gonna make sure you remember.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.191
So, I don't know if you've ever had
a parole officer or not,

08:45.274 --> 08:47.068
but you've got one now.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.153
Every six hours,
you're gonna check in with me

08:49.237 --> 08:51.322
at one of our places.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.741
I'll let you know where.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.702
If you don't pick up the phone,
BOLO on your ass.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.288
If you're five minutes late, BOLO.

08:59.997 --> 09:03.251
If you sneeze, BOLO.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.086
Okay, if you were gonna do
all of that,

09:05.169 --> 09:07.171
why didn't you just turn me in
to the EMPD?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.756
Because then they would take over.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.758
This is my investigation.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.679
BOLO.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.606
-Hey, I thought you had an errand.
-It's done.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.316
What do we have?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.569
Well, we found some unknown hairs
on Raymond's body.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.405
-And given where we found them...
-The bathing suit area.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.073
Yes, the bathing suit area.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.701
It looks like Raymond was with someone
the night of his murder.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.203
Possibly a woman, possibly in bed.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.913
And I'm gonna swab for DNA now.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.248
All right, so, preliminary tox

09:42.331 --> 09:44.917
shows everything from alcohol
to Ambien in his system.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.420
Now, I don't know
why Raymond would need a sleep aid

09:47.503 --> 09:49.589
because his blood alcohol level
was sky-high.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.174
So unless he had
an extremely high tolerance level,

09:52.550 --> 09:53.968
he was most likely passed out, drunk.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.761
See that notch scraped upwards?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.096
Yeah, the killer must have
pulled him up.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.390
Takes a lot of upper-body strength
to do that.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.310
So it's looking like
our killer isn't a woman.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.686
Ouch.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.147
Misogynist much?
I mean, we're right here.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.857
Did you think the killer was a woman?

10:07.940 --> 10:08.941
Potentially.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.194
Because a woman asked me
to prove her innocence.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.487
New lady friend?

10:13.571 --> 10:16.157
-Voice like Lauren Bacall, body like--
-Tawnya.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.371
- The woman is Tawnya.
- And that woman

10:22.455 --> 10:23.998
better be in police custody right now.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.417
No, only because
I don't want her there yet.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.462
Nope. Not doing it.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.755
I did not sign up

10:30.838 --> 10:33.341
to work for that bitch
who almost ruined my brother's life.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.634
Not happening.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.847
Well, you don't work for Tawnya.

10:40.264 --> 10:44.143
You work for me.
So let's all get to work.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.493
Hey, you.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.829
I went down to the lab earlier
to say hi, and you...

11:04.246 --> 11:06.916
I ran into Norm from HR.
You know Norm, right?

11:06.999 --> 11:09.293
Anyway, he mentioned you two talked.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.544
Didn't know Norm was the chatty type.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.296
Yeah. It's the low talking.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.882
You know, he's always saying something
if you know how to listen.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.636
And you know what he said?
He said you requested

11:18.719 --> 11:20.096
a resignation form.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.433
One of the perks
of working together, huh?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.811
No difficult conversations
with your significant other

11:26.894 --> 11:29.188
because Norm from HR
will have them for you.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.942
Hey, someone mention Norm from HR?
I actually owe him a birthday gift.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.360
Look, I'm guessing you two have
some work to do,

11:34.443 --> 11:36.195
so I'll let you get to it.

11:41.158 --> 11:44.120
So, before Raymond's party boy life,
he invented an app

11:44.203 --> 11:46.288
to help diabetic patients
monitor blood sugar

11:46.372 --> 11:47.415
without invasive testing.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.834
Raymond got rich,
brought on some employees,

11:49.917 --> 11:53.045
among them, Bradley Morgan,
another developer and friend.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.297
If Raymond let Bradley go,
that could be a motive for murder.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.925
Exactly. And then,
we also have Ivan Keller,

11:58.008 --> 11:59.301
friend and potential moocher.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.346
Well if Ivan lost his meal ticket,
it could also be a motive for murder.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.393
Hold up. I never told you
Raymond lost all his money.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.686
You didn't.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.646
Tawnya did.

12:13.607 --> 12:14.942
Really? You're interrogating me?

12:15.025 --> 12:19.071
Okay, Rosie, I want to believe
you can compartmentalize,

12:19.155 --> 12:23.367
but, I mean, who's to say you're
not gonna fall for her all over again?

12:23.451 --> 12:25.119
Villa, I have a plan.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.330
Oh, yeah? Well, so did Bridget Fonda
and Bill Paxton, and it backfired.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.332
Yes, but their plan
was only a simple one.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.751
It's not foolproof like mine.

12:32.501 --> 12:35.880
Look, okay, first, I know
where Tawnya is at all times.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.382
Second, I told her I was
taking this case

12:38.466 --> 12:39.633
to find out the truth.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.719
But I'm really setting the table,
'cause I'm gonna serve up

12:41.802 --> 12:44.013
-a meal of--
-Please. Please don't say "justice."

12:44.096 --> 12:45.181
Of justice.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.684
I'm gonna get my money back,
and I'm gonna put her behind bars

12:48.768 --> 12:50.352
-for good.
-If I didn't know you so well,

12:50.436 --> 12:52.188
I'd say you've been
planning that monologue

12:52.271 --> 12:53.314
since Tawnya conned you.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.357
You do. And I have.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.610
But, right now, we need to focus
on the suspects,

12:57.693 --> 13:00.529
because all the evidence points
to a significantly strong individual.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.656
I'm thinking Raymond's friends,
Bradley or Ivan.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.366
Okay, wait. You're forgetting

13:04.450 --> 13:06.994
that Tawnya likes to work
with a partner.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.288
Like Kayla, her "daughter"?

13:09.371 --> 13:13.459
I mean, who's to say
she hasn't found a 6'6" "son"

13:13.542 --> 13:16.420
who's angry at the world
and willing to kill for her?

13:16.504 --> 13:19.924
Rosie, you can't let your guard down
with this woman.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.801
Villa, I know what I'm doing.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.094
So, where's Tawnya now?

13:24.845 --> 13:26.639
Don't worry about it.
I got it covered.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.773
Where is Beaumont?
I need a word with him.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.233
EMPD.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.443
Talking to Villa about the new case.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.822
Was this new case referred by EMPD
or a third party?

13:43.155 --> 13:45.115
-The EMPD.
-There's a mysterious third party.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.078
Wow. She already heard you say that.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.331
Okay.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.291
You know what, Pippy?
I'm gonna nominate you to tell her,

13:54.375 --> 13:56.001
-'cause she's your mama.
-Yeah.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.547
Raymond Larsen, tech-entrepreneur
turned-hanging-victim.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.673
And this Raymond Larsen,

14:00.756 --> 14:03.551
was he also guilty
of lying by omission?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.261
I'm pretty sure that's just Pippy.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.055
-Pippy.
-Hmm.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.141
As partial owner of this lab,
I am entitled to the details

14:11.225 --> 14:13.769
of every case that comes our way.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.898
As your mother,
I am entitled to your honesty.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.610
Wow. That's like a very sick,
passive-aggressive burn, and I...

14:21.694 --> 14:23.112
Yep. Burn much.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.698
Tawnya.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
Yep, that name, hurts your soul.

14:29.535 --> 14:33.455
She conned this guy and then asked us
to prove that she didn't kill him.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.040
Rosie says he's got this.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.918
I know you're gonna try to turn this
into a whole thing.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.921
So, I'm begging you,
turn this into a whole thing.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.381
And please let me help.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.514
Sorry. Traffic.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.184
I drove. She's telling the truth.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.854
JooJoo, I told you all you had to do
is monitor her ankle monitor.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.355
Nuh- uh. And risk her gnawing it off?

14:58.439 --> 14:59.648
Have you ever tested her DNA?

14:59.732 --> 15:02.359
She could be part bear
or wolf or something.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.777
Thanks, bro.

15:04.820 --> 15:05.779
That's what friends do.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.830
Like what I've done with the place?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.749
Sorry. Didn't mean to stare.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.919
Well, I'm here, checked in.
What's next?

15:20.002 --> 15:22.755
Oh, let me tell you
what I think happened to Raymond.

15:22.838 --> 15:23.797
He found you,

15:23.881 --> 15:26.050
confronted you about the money
that you stole from him.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.552
You killed him.
You made it look like a suicide.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.221
But you weren't working alone.
You had a partner.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.431
And it was a man.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.515
Partner?

15:33.891 --> 15:36.143
Yeah, 'cause
that worked out perfectly last time.

15:36.226 --> 15:39.229
My "daughter"
got too attached to the job.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.316
You mean she got too attached to me?

15:43.150 --> 15:44.193
Rosie...

15:45.027 --> 15:48.989
in my line of work, you get attached,
you don't survive.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.617
Oh, you mean
like Raymond didn't survive

15:51.700 --> 15:53.452
because he got too attached to you?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.748
You may not have killed him,
but you are complicit in his death

15:57.831 --> 15:59.792
because you took away his livelihood.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.961
And I got to live with that
for the rest of my life.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.295
Yeah, poor baby.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.218
Speaking of partners, looks like
you have to get back to yours.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.637
Some things never change.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.391
Hold on. You're not just gonna
leave me here by myself, are you?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.309
Why? There's nothing to take.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.186
You already took it all.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.116
We heard Raymond's company
was having financial difficulties.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.409
Were you working for him when he died?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.577
I was on temporary leave.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.621
Sounds like a lot of words
to say that he fired you.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.124
If I wanted job security,
I'd work at a bank.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.252
And you?
How long had you known Raymond?

16:43.335 --> 16:45.379
We met last month in yoga class.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.465
He loaned me some money.
I was paying him back.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.883
What time did you last see Raymond?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.177
I left the party around midnight
to get to work,

16:52.928 --> 16:56.765
but Raymond had already started using
models and tequila to self-medicate.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.435
Last night, his would-be investors
backed out.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.769
-Why?
-Cold feet.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.937
Happens all the time.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.690
If Theresa hadn't already
destroyed him, that news would have.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.776
Theresa? You mean this Theresa?

17:08.360 --> 17:09.945
Yeah. That's her.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.286
Rosie.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.370
Good morning, beautiful.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.546
"I'm sorry. I don't have the words
to describe what I have to do."

17:28.547 --> 17:29.506
Are you okay?

17:30.716 --> 17:32.051
Yeah, I am, but Raymond wasn't.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.803
Sounds like a suicide note.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.764
You sure this is murder?

17:36.847 --> 17:39.224
Yeah, pretty damn sure,
but now we have to prove it.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.561
- Beaumont. A word?
- Sorry, Mom.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.021
Right now I got to get to
the body on the table.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.230
There is no body.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.735
As partial owner of this lab,
I'm permitted to veto a case,

17:49.818 --> 17:51.653
which is exactly what I have done.

17:52.071 --> 17:56.325
The body of Raymond Larsen
has been transferred to the EMPD.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.375
Thank you.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.920
Rosie. What a nice surprise!

18:08.003 --> 18:09.463
Except, I had a feeling
you might drop by.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.466
Yeah, because you've got the body that
my mother/business partner sent over.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.551
And, listen, she just thinks she knows
what's best for me,

18:14.635 --> 18:18.764
and, actually, she's right always,
most of the time, kind of,

18:18.847 --> 18:22.768
and maybe I should listen to her,
but I'm here, and all I'm asking

18:23.060 --> 18:24.186
is you keep me in the loop.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.065
Keeping him in the loop
is not the worst idea.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.152
Then, let's get to work.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.862
Let's get to work.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.783
So, let me take a look at the X-rays.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.788
If Raymond jumped off that chair
by himself, the force of the fall

18:42.871 --> 18:45.207
would have broken
his upper cervical vertebrae, but...

18:46.125 --> 18:47.459
- but they're intact.
- Yep.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.294
Coupled with
the upward notch on the beam,

18:49.670 --> 18:50.671
looks like Raymond was on the ground

18:50.754 --> 18:51.755
when the rope was tied
around his neck.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.006
And then pulled up.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.843
Well, forensic techs are
still analyzing the hotel stationery,

18:55.926 --> 18:58.428
and I'm guessing they'll find
that imprint of a suicide note

18:58.512 --> 19:00.055
-was fake.
-This was murder.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.849
Question is whether or not
it was Tawnya

19:01.932 --> 19:04.518
and her potential
new partner in crime.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.729
The ligature furrow on his neck
left a bland impression.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.314
There's no bruising or bleeding.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.357
No extravasated blood.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.609
Which means that Raymond was
already dead when the killer hung him.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.528
We need to talk to the last person
who saw him alive.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.864
We swabbed Raymond's DNA
before the transfer.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.323
I can run it.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.992
Well, actually,
it could take all night.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.952
My lab has already processed it.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.581
So if it's cool with you, maybe I can
talk to the person who processed it.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.791
Yeah. I'm cool.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.587
Villa, you coming?

19:31.920 --> 19:32.880
Um...

19:32.963 --> 19:34.089
I'm gonna hang back.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.675
Oh, okay.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.678
I'm gonna peace out.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.648
Ever heard of a phone?

19:52.149 --> 19:55.068
Okay, sure, yeah.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.153
Come on in.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.487
Should I make you dinner, too, or...

19:57.571 --> 19:59.990
No, actually, I just need the DNA
for Raymond's body.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.576
Okay, I think you're
confusing me with TMI.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.746
-DNA is her department.
-No, no, I called her, three times.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.748
So I figured, why not just
come over here and see her?

20:08.081 --> 20:10.250
Again, this is not TMI's apartment,

20:10.334 --> 20:11.960
so I don't know
why you would come here.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.379
Pipp, don't make me go
into your bedroom again.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.715
Oh, look, there she is.

20:16.798 --> 20:17.925
This isn't weird--

20:18.008 --> 20:19.343
- Whoa.
- ...at all.

20:19.843 --> 20:20.802
Um...

20:21.094 --> 20:23.472
Can we please just talk... One minute.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.682
...about work?

20:26.183 --> 20:28.352
The DNA results
are still being processed,

20:28.518 --> 20:30.103
but we should have the full results
in the morning.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.564
And we could also have them tonight.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.566
Yeah, if I expedited them.

20:35.150 --> 20:39.279
But, you know, actually,
the preliminary findings indicated

20:39.363 --> 20:41.365
-that Raymond was with three people.
-Yep.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.784
Or women, actually, is more accurate.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.744
I'm feeling...

20:46.411 --> 20:49.706
very awkward and vulnerable right now.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.293
Okay, just text me
when you have the names.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.753
Text you the names, boss.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.255
I thought that we weren't
on the case anymore.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.049
And I thought you and TMI broke up.
Good night.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.428
Tell me about the last time
you saw Raymond.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.014
It was passionate.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.183
-Unhinged.
-Unprotected.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.561
When was the last time you saw him?

21:11.645 --> 21:13.730
After we... you know.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.401
After we had filthy, hot sex.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.572
Well, I could tell
something was wrong.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.491
So I followed Raymond
into the bathroom.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.911
I was just trying to help.
But another woman showed up.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.289
You mean her?

21:30.622 --> 21:31.748
No.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.459
No. But she was African-American.

21:35.168 --> 21:36.712
Pretty enough to be on television.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.464
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.844
And Raymond was not happy to see her.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.444
Man.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.614
Out of all our places,
this one's my favorite.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.784
You lied to me.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.911
You saw Raymond
the night that he died.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.873
That gives you the means
and the motive to murder him.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.500
Okay, please,
I can explain, all right?

22:15.584 --> 22:17.085
Raymond tracked me down
about a week ago.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.712
Tracked you down.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.505
You're not easy to track down.
You know what? Check that.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.300
-You're impossible to track down.
-Not if I want to be found.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.678
-And Raymond said what exactly?
-That he needed his money back.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.555
That it was
a matter of life and death.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.474
Did you go see him that night
to make sure he didn't turn you in?

22:30.557 --> 22:35.437
No. No, I went to take him
the rest of his money I had left.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.356
-100 grand.
-Okay, so, I'm supposed to believe

22:37.439 --> 22:40.108
that you returned
Raymond's money because?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.568
Because...

22:42.819 --> 22:44.571
Because I loved him, Rosie.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.825
He was worth changing for.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.204
And he wasn't the first.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.208
You didn't tell me that earlier.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.170
-Because I was scared.
-What? That I wouldn't believe you?

23:01.004 --> 23:03.131
Or that I would
want my money back, too?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.342
You know, the money you stole.
So, go ahead and say it.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.843
The money you stole. Say it.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.720
The money I stole.

23:10.889 --> 23:11.932
Please.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.602
Your money is gone. I spent it.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.606
But I promise if you clear my name,

23:19.689 --> 23:21.858
I'll find a way
to get you your money back.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.238
You know, the ocean's
a beautiful thing.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.158
It seduces you,
makes you feel you're safe.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.953
Then it pulls you under.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.917
No, this view isn't what it was,
or what it should be.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.921
I like this view much better.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.051
Hi, Tawnya.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.637
You know, I don't feel like
making small talk,

23:50.720 --> 23:52.639
so I'm just gonna say
you're under arrest.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.766
We have enough to hold her
until we can get her

23:54.850 --> 23:56.059
for Raymond's murder.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.728
If you're willing to press charges.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.730
Rosie, please.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.315
-You'll regret it if you--
-You're done.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.734
Rosie.

24:05.485 --> 24:06.528
Come on.

24:25.839 --> 24:28.508
Go ahead. This is your chance.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.385
Say what you want to say to me.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.722
Everything I feel for you...

24:35.724 --> 24:37.934
everything I want to do to you,

24:40.270 --> 24:42.689
I think I'm communicating to you
right now.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.079
Tawnya brought Raymond some money
the night that he died.

24:58.163 --> 25:01.082
You mean she claims she gave him money
the night he was murdered?

25:01.166 --> 25:03.710
-She loved him, Villa.
-Oh, my God. This woman!

25:03.793 --> 25:05.754
Don't tell me
you believe that lie, too.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.089
Look, either way, she said
he needed the money

25:08.173 --> 25:09.257
as a matter of life or death.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.259
And I think we both know
who might be the killer.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.179
Actually, I did find traces of BPA
and cocaine on Raymond's fingers,

25:14.262 --> 25:15.263
but none in his system.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.515
See? He must have handled it.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.101
Money is rife with contaminants.
Cocaine, BPA, flax, cotton.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.478
All present on Raymond's fingertips.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.438
Which means Tawnya could have been
telling the truth

25:23.522 --> 25:25.398
about bringing Raymond money
the night that he was killed.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.442
Okay, great.
She brings Raymond the cash.

25:27.526 --> 25:31.363
He lets his guard down, she kills him,
then takes back the cash.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.990
That's not love.
That's classic bait and switch.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.201
-Adrian, what do you think?
-Him? My God.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.037
I might have found cause of death.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.748
Take a look.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.667
Under the ligature marks
from the rope.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.128
Two different ligature patterns.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.464
One tapered upwards
from the rope postmortem,

25:49.548 --> 25:51.174
which obscured the second.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.801
A deep horizontal furrow.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.596
Raymond didn't die from hanging.
He died from manual strangulation.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.349
And if he was as inebriated
as the blood alcohol content suggests,

25:59.432 --> 26:01.685
then a woman would have had
the strength to strangle him.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.854
Let me guess.
You want to interrogate Tawnya.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.856
I want to follow the money.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.203
Took you long enough, Rosie.
Your guilt catch up to you?

26:30.422 --> 26:31.423
Sit.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.694
Where is my son's money?

26:53.486 --> 26:54.487
Gone.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.114
I spent it all.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.283
Sweetheart, I've been reading
would-be criminals like you

26:58.366 --> 27:01.161
long before you even knew
what "coy" meant.

27:01.244 --> 27:05.540
I have a mother's instinct, you see.
I saw the way you looked at my son.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.208
He may have been your mark,

27:07.292 --> 27:09.252
but that is not
all that he meant to you.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.672
Does that make what I did to him
better or worse?

27:12.756 --> 27:13.757
Here's my theory.

27:13.840 --> 27:18.136
You went on to your next mark
so quickly because you needed money.

27:18.219 --> 27:22.349
You felt guilty
about spending Beaumont's, hmm?

27:23.308 --> 27:25.143
I didn't have a mother like you.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.354
My mother was a grifter.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.608
But she was like you in one way.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.069
She could read people.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.155
Except, she wasn't looking
for the good in them.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.158
She was looking
for the best way to take them.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.578
It was the only way
she knew how to survive.

27:44.704 --> 27:47.832
And it was the only way she taught me
how to survive.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.251
Why do I sense a sob story coming on?

27:50.335 --> 27:52.712
Oh, don't worry. It's a good one.

27:53.254 --> 27:56.800
You see, when I was younger,
right after my mother died,

27:56.883 --> 27:58.635
I scammed the wrong person.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.388
And that person...

28:02.263 --> 28:04.849
has made me pay for it my whole life.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.228
And you're saying
that if you don't pay this person,

28:08.311 --> 28:10.897
-they're going to kill you?
-He will.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.983
Well, that is a good story.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.318
It also happens to be true.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.570
Whether it's true or not

28:17.654 --> 28:21.282
makes absolutely no difference to me.

28:21.366 --> 28:25.328
Now, here's something that should
make a difference to you, however.

28:25.578 --> 28:27.414
Is staying in jail.

28:27.747 --> 28:33.420
You see, the second you get out,
I will find you.

28:33.962 --> 28:40.677
And I will dedicate my life
to making yours unlivable.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.850
Still no luck tracking the 100 grand
Tawnya brought Raymond

28:46.933 --> 28:48.518
-the night he died.
-You know, we're not flowing.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.520
-Excuse me?
-We need a heart-to-heart.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.148
-You and Adrian. Something's going on.
-Correct. We're dating.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.233
No, no, no, Villa. I get a vibe.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.234
What's up?

28:56.317 --> 28:57.819
Please. Like you need to
shoulder my problems.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.989
Yeah, I do, because you are my friend.

29:02.615 --> 29:03.867
It's Adrian's mother.

29:04.367 --> 29:08.580
Her Alzheimer's has progressed
faster than her doctors anticipated.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.583
She needs 24/7 care.
But she didn't get into

29:11.666 --> 29:16.129
the assisted-living facility
she liked, so Adrian's gonna resign

29:16.212 --> 29:18.590
and take over her care full time.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.926
-Wow. That's real-life stuff.
-Yeah, real-life stuff.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.470
Have you met his mother yet?

29:23.553 --> 29:25.430
N... What?

29:25.513 --> 29:27.265
No, but I've met yours.

29:27.348 --> 29:28.767
This is not about me. Come on.
This is about you. Let's...

29:28.850 --> 29:31.102
No, I mean I've met your mother,
which is how I know

29:31.186 --> 29:33.021
that's her coming from visitation
right now.

29:33.813 --> 29:37.358
What? You're not the only one
who gets favors from the EMPD.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.402
Although it is interesting
seeing you here

29:39.486 --> 29:41.237
despite your case being transferred.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.989
Really? Well, my case involves Tawnya,

29:43.072 --> 29:44.866
the same person
that you're here to see, I guess.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.327
You'll never believe
the sob story that woman gave me.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.871
Something about owing money
to the wrong person.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.415
Yes, I saw that, and I second it.

29:52.499 --> 29:55.460
We've been thinking about
where that $100,000 is right now.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.504
But we haven't been asking
why Raymond needed it.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.339
Maybe he owed money
to the wrong person.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.299
-And then they killed him for it.
-Right. Raymond was wealthy.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.718
It's not like he'd hit up
some strip-mall loan shark.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.429
We'd be looking for a banker
or a shell corporation

30:06.513 --> 30:08.097
that could funnel money to Raymond.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.390
Right.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.725
Well, here we go.

30:11.768 --> 30:15.480
Centralized Financial. The LLC
that made small deposits

30:15.563 --> 30:18.399
into Raymond's account totaling
100 grand over the past month.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.651
It doesn't look like a business to me.

30:19.734 --> 30:23.238
Oh, it isn't. It's a shell corporation
owned by Gavin Eauclaire.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.282
He doles out high-interest loans
no bank would ever bet on.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.618
The Feds have investigated him
for money laundering,

30:28.701 --> 30:32.080
but Gavin's smart enough
to make sure the charges never stick.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.581
Think he'll let us in?

30:33.706 --> 30:35.250
No. I think he's coming to us.

30:38.044 --> 30:39.462
EMPD.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.506
Should I call my lawyers now
or after you leave?

30:41.589 --> 30:43.258
Do you remember him, Mr. Eauclaire?

30:43.341 --> 30:45.760
Raymond Larsen, the guy
who couldn't pay you back

30:45.844 --> 30:47.762
the 100 grand he owed you
and turned up dead?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.931
-100 grand? Try 300.
-Even better.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.475
He could only give you 100 grand,
so you killed him.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.726
You talk, all I hear is motive.

30:53.810 --> 30:57.146
All I hear is that Raymond Larsen had
$100,000 that he never gave me.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.439
And he never told you about the money?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.984
He told me he was expecting
a large chunk very soon.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.902
Some big investors
were backing his new app.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.320
Do you know the names
of these investors?

31:04.904 --> 31:06.698
-Now, that's privileged.
-Oh, right, right.

31:06.781 --> 31:10.118
I forgot about desperate,
sad, sad, loan-shark privilege.

31:10.201 --> 31:13.079
-Why'd they back out?
-Something about Raymond's past work.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.998
Maybe an app malfunctioning.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.458
One more question.
Where were you two nights ago?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.295
With my wife.
And she'll tell you the same thing.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.964
Just so you know,
I would never have killed Raymond.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.632
Dead people don't pay.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.593
Got to admire his honesty.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.386
No, no, I don't.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.805
Gavin was telling the truth.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.058
There was a lawsuit filed
against Sweetwater Industries,

31:34.142 --> 31:35.310
a medical supply company

31:35.393 --> 31:37.145
that specializes
in the treatment of diabetes.

31:37.228 --> 31:39.856
-What's their connection to Raymond?
-Well, they purchased his first app,

31:39.939 --> 31:42.400
the one that monitored insulin levels
in diabetic patients.

31:42.483 --> 31:45.028
So Sweetwater was legally liable
if that app malfunctioned.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.488
So, if Raymond's name was never
publicly dragged through the mud,

31:47.572 --> 31:49.616
-the suit probably was dismissed.
-It was.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.659
But Sweetwater's lawyers
were sweet enough

31:51.743 --> 31:53.411
once I threatened a subpoena

31:53.494 --> 31:56.372
to give me the name
of the family that sued. Whitehall.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.250
Raymond's technology malfunctioned,
putting the family's grandmother

31:59.334 --> 32:02.211
into a coma, where she still is,
in Wisconsin.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.880
Medical bills must be compounding
every day.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.214
Yep, and Sweetwater's lawyers

32:05.298 --> 32:06.883
didn't seem to be
losing any sleep over that.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.134
Yeah, but Raymond was.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.803
And I think I know
where he was sending the money.

32:11.888 --> 32:15.391
Louisa Whitehall, 62,
in a coma at Madison General.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.477
Pretty sure the Ambien
that was in Raymond's system

32:17.560 --> 32:19.395
was 'cause he was losing sleep
over Louisa.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.813
-Why?
-Because he blamed himself

32:20.897 --> 32:21.898
for her condition.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.816
He couldn't afford to keep paying
her medical bills.

32:25.818 --> 32:28.112
-Can you zoom in on her cheek?
-Yeah.

32:30.823 --> 32:32.241
Top three motives for murder?

32:32.325 --> 32:35.286
-Money, sex, and...
-Revenge.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.372
I think I know who killed Raymond.

32:54.597 --> 32:57.600
Who knew the Miami to Madison route
was so popular?

32:57.684 --> 32:58.810
Crazy, huh?

32:58.893 --> 33:00.395
Of course, I know
you're on your way to Wisconsin

33:00.478 --> 33:02.438
to pay for your grandmother Louisa's
medical bills.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.065
How do you know she's my grandmother?

33:04.148 --> 33:05.733
Focal dermal hypoplasia.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.402
The pink and white bumps on your hand.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.740
Ivan. Don't hurt anyone else
trying to help your grandmother.

33:12.824 --> 33:13.908
I'm gonna get off this bus.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.245
Oh, come on.

33:17.328 --> 33:21.207
I have a gun. You have a knife.
Who do you think's gonna win?

33:22.125 --> 33:23.543
- Stay down, stay down.
- Oh, my God.

33:23.626 --> 33:26.629
Drop the knife. Nice and easy.

33:29.507 --> 33:32.051
Drop the bag. Take two steps back.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.646
-Could have used the zipper.
-The knife was way cooler.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.772
You're right. It was cool.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.400
Ivan Keller, you're under arrest
for the murder of Raymond Larsen.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.699
Okay,
make this easy on yourself.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.367
Tell us how you befriended Raymond.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.869
I didn't befriend him.

33:57.952 --> 33:58.995
I found him.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.789
And he agreed to pay my grandma's
medical bills until she recovered.

34:01.873 --> 34:02.999
See, that's the thing, Ivan.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.834
We checked with
your grandmother's hospital.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.753
The day Raymond died,
they let you know

34:06.836 --> 34:10.131
she wasn't gonna recover, because of
Raymond's faulty technology.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.549
So you killed him.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.760
Anything else you'd like to add?

34:14.761 --> 34:16.429
-Yes.
-"Yes" what?

34:16.971 --> 34:19.182
Yes, I killed Raymond.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.354
I'm gonna need you
to sign a confession.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.608
I didn't think I had it in me,
to kill someone.

34:28.691 --> 34:31.277
But when they told me
that she wasn't going to make it,

34:31.360 --> 34:32.904
I got so angry.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.322
She raised me.

34:34.405 --> 34:37.116
And I just kept seeing her
in that hospital bed.

34:37.200 --> 34:40.119
Not dead, but not really alive either.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.622
And I just...

34:43.122 --> 34:44.290
snapped.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.760
I guess we're done here.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.970
Yeah. That's...

34:59.555 --> 35:00.431
great news.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.475
Don't tell me you're upset
Tawnya didn't do it.

35:02.558 --> 35:03.559
No.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.061
Making peace with the fact

35:05.144 --> 35:08.606
that sometimes closure is better
in theory than in reality.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.192
Sucks, doesn't it?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.532
Well, maybe you haven't had
closure yet.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.617
Nope. I'm ready to let this go.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.371
Hey, we need to go.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.914
-Where?
-Your lab.

35:24.997 --> 35:27.208
-Why? The case is closed.
-No, it isn't.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.503
So, if we already know
that the killer is human and not robe,

35:30.586 --> 35:32.630
what is it exactly
that we're looking at here?

35:32.713 --> 35:34.215
Besides free hotel merchandise,

35:34.298 --> 35:35.716
which is only nice
if you brought enough for everyone.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.511
Okay, don't think of this as a robe.
It's the murder weapon.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.680
We know that Raymond
was strangled. We just don't know

35:40.763 --> 35:42.306
what Ivan used to strangle him with.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.100
I found hair-like fibers
on Raymond's neck.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.769
75% fibroin, 22% sericin.

35:46.853 --> 35:47.895
Consistent with silk.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.439
And I was able to match
the fibers on Raymond's neck...

35:50.815 --> 35:51.899
to this.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.277
Okay, but the killer
already confessed.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.654
Confessions get thrown out of court
all the time.

35:56.737 --> 35:57.738
We need evidence.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.615
Well, there's DNA
all over the murder weapon.

35:59.699 --> 36:03.244
Well, Raymond's hotel room was kind of
a "best of bodily fluids" festival.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.329
-Okay.
-He slept with three women, guys.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.832
And all the DNA on the murder weapon
is female.

36:07.915 --> 36:10.209
Ivan was working
with a female partner.

36:10.793 --> 36:15.006
And we can't discount the fact
that Tawnya was also in the room.

36:15.590 --> 36:16.966
May she rest.

36:17.049 --> 36:19.427
Oh, forgot.
That bitch is still kickin'.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.888
We need to match
the DNA from the robe tie

36:21.971 --> 36:23.764
to each woman that was
in Raymond's room that night.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.516
While I'm all
for the pursuit of justice,

36:25.600 --> 36:27.727
I am wondering why you brought
the murder weapon here.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.604
Because I found prints
and I don't have the equipment

36:29.687 --> 36:30.771
to lift them from fabric.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.149
We-We do.

36:33.232 --> 36:36.694
Lifting prints from silk is
the forensic equivalent to Sisyphus.

36:38.112 --> 36:39.989
And this robe tie is our boulder.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.075
Okay. All right. Let's get to work.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.879
We have prints on our murder weapon.

37:38.047 --> 37:40.341
And we know the person
who they belong to.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.347
What are we doing here?

37:46.931 --> 37:49.392
I confessed. I killed Raymond.

37:49.475 --> 37:52.353
Well, let's just say
this case is personal to us,

37:52.436 --> 37:53.980
just like it's personal to you.

37:54.063 --> 37:56.232
Because when you killed Raymond,
you weren't working alone.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.234
That's not true. I swear.

37:58.901 --> 38:01.028
You know, there was a time I would've
taken you at your word for this,

38:01.112 --> 38:04.240
but someone got to me.
Made me not trust people.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.451
Do you trust someone, Ivan?

38:07.994 --> 38:09.870
Like the woman
who helped you kill Raymond?

38:09.954 --> 38:10.955
No, it was me.

38:11.038 --> 38:12.456
It was all me. I told you.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.543
I lost control when I found out
my grandmother wasn't gonna recover.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.003
Please, you have to believe me.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.254
Okay, this is...

38:18.337 --> 38:20.881
This is sort of a bad news/good news
situation.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.468
The bad news is, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison.

38:24.802 --> 38:27.805
The good news is,
you won't be doing it alone.

38:27.888 --> 38:28.931
Bring her in.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.145
Sarah. No, no, no.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.564
-I didn't tell them anything.
-I knew you wouldn't.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.816
We ran all the DNA
on the murder weapon.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.693
Guess what?

38:40.776 --> 38:42.820
Turns out that you're
a familial match here

38:42.903 --> 38:44.905
to old Sarah, your sister.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.033
Oh, and her fingerprints
were on the robe tie.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.368
She strangled him
while you held him down.

38:49.785 --> 38:50.745
Get them out.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.246
I'm sorry.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.584
Hey.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.128
-Thank you.
-No, thank Adrian.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.466
Oh, by the way...

39:03.924 --> 39:07.261
Tawnya's being transferred today.
I thought you should know.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.940
-Beaumont.
-It's okay that you...

39:20.858 --> 39:22.109
transferred the case, Mom.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.654
It's okay that you went to see Tawnya.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.618
But from now on, you need to practice
letting me fight my own battles.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.872
The next battle you fight will not be
one that you can handle alone.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.999
You know about my dialysis.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.417
I do.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.836
Am I upset? Yes.

39:41.587 --> 39:44.799
Are my feelings hurt
that you didn't tell me? Yes.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.676
Will I get over it? Of course.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.054
Let me guess.

39:50.596 --> 39:52.973
You have your thoughts
on how I should proceed.

39:53.307 --> 39:54.350
Many.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.480
But the first one is this.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.360
You will sit down
with your team, your family,

40:04.443 --> 40:06.153
and tell them what's going on.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.072
And then we will...

40:08.614 --> 40:10.199
We will figure it out.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.577
One day at a time, together.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.051
Hi.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.598
-Those are the resignation papers?
-They are.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.350
But I can't bring myself to sign them.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.395
I might be able to help.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.818
Look, I know that we haven't
been together that long,

40:46.360 --> 40:48.988
and this is a huge thing to ask.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.865
You can't shock me.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.702
I want you to meet my mother.

40:57.163 --> 41:00.958
Her memories are fading,
and to be honest,

41:01.041 --> 41:03.294
I don't even think
she'll remember meeting you.

41:03.377 --> 41:04.837
But you will.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.089
But I will.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.301
I'd love to meet her.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.429
Thank you.

41:15.222 --> 41:18.559
Now, about your resignation papers,

41:18.642 --> 41:20.394
I have something to tell you, too.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.813
Rosie and I pulled some strings

41:22.897 --> 41:25.774
at the assisted-living facility
your mother liked.

41:27.526 --> 41:28.611
She's in.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.949
I don't even know what to say.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.495
You don't have to say anything.

41:49.673 --> 41:51.800
I'm glad you came to say goodbye.

41:54.386 --> 41:58.849
And I hope that, one day,
you can forgive me.

42:02.478 --> 42:03.938
'Cause, Rosie, what we had...

42:06.398 --> 42:08.275
Well, parts of it, at least,

42:10.778 --> 42:13.948
they were just as real to me
as they were to you.

42:18.118 --> 42:20.704
Well, I didn't...
I didn't come to say goodbye.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.166
And I didn't come to forgive you.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.168
Oh...

42:26.418 --> 42:27.711
That's right.

42:28.837 --> 42:31.006
You cleared my name, and...

42:32.091 --> 42:34.677
I promised I'd find a way
to get you your money back.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.345
It's not about the money.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.681
I can always make more money.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.185
Plus, I don't want you hurting
someone else just to pay me back.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.565
Then why are you here, Rosie?

42:50.317 --> 42:53.487
I thought it would feel good
to watch you lose your freedom.

42:56.323 --> 42:57.866
And it doesn't feel good?

43:05.249 --> 43:06.458
No, it doesn't.

43:09.003 --> 43:10.296
It feels great.
