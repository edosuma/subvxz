in college...

19:00.440 --> 19:03.107
I was devastated.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.344

feel happy again.

hadn't dumped me,

I never would have met
your father.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.475

your mind?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.639
I overheard you talking
to Eddie,

20:08.641 --> 20:10.041
and it made me think --

20:10.043 --> 20:13.044
if I had a daughter
and she had her heart broken,

20:13.046 --> 20:15.213
I'd hunt the boy down who did it
and murder him.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.916
