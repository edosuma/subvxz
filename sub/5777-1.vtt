I'm on the line here.

Ten is break-even. I say 12.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.841
Right. Nothing's impossible, Albert.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.201
Impossible just takes
a couple extra phone calls.

-Yes, Mr. Ireland.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.486

I am allowed to fire that senile old idiot.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.643
Really? I didn't...

09:20.160 --> 09:22.401

09:22.480 --> 09:26.007
Look, Mr. Himmelman, you can't fire Milton.
He's been here forever.

A hotel is more
than just facilities and amenities. It's...

09:29.080 --> 09:31.367
Are you trying to tell me how to run a hotel?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.966
No, sir. No, nein. Iwould never do that.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.681
I'm just saying
that the Bradbury's like a family.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.209
It's a place where you have an eccentric
old bellhop or a hotel manager that charges

09:41.280 --> 09:44.648
thousands of dollars in personal
long-distance phone calls to the hotel.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.965
Doesn't mean we want
that family member fired or in jail.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.764
Because that would be
upsetting to the family.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.841

-Tickets?

(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

39:12.200 --> 39:13.725
That was great.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.688
- Is someone sitting here?
-Yes.

39:16.840 --> 39:19.605
You know,
I think that's where you're mistaken.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.761
Why am I mistaken?

39:20.920 --> 39:24.686
Christian said to tell you he was very sorry
but he was unavoidably detained.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.043
- Oh.
-Yeah, afraid so.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.168
And he sent you scurrying over to tell me?

39:29.240 --> 39:31.607
Well, I didn't scurry. I don't scurry.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.961
I take the subway like any other animal.

39:34.880 --> 39:38.362
Christian and I have formed this friendship
wherein we do each other favors.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.370
For instance, right now,
he's at the 7-Eleven getting me a Slurpee.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.929
About the other day,

39:47.480 --> 39:49.847
you kind of took me by surprise, you know.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.651
- I'm sorry.
-Where is he?

39:51.920 --> 39:53.888
I told you. I really wanted a Slurpee.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.928
No. Really.

39:56.480 --> 40:00.371
He said he was very sorry that he couldn't
make it, and he was absolutely forlorn

40:00.480 --> 40:01.481
and he had to...

40:01.560 --> 40:03.050
Did he go to the country?

40:03.640 --> 40:06.086
- Yeah. He went directly from the office.
-(SIGHS)

No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:10.800 --> 40:14.521
No, he went to the country.
His wife went to a different country.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.607
- She went to France.
-France?

40:17.960 --> 40:21.282
Yeah. It's finally over between them,
and she was really depressed,

40:22.080 --> 40:26.165
and she felt she needed to go somewhere
where she could, uh, speak French.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.603
- What?
-Yeah, you know how rich people are.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.728
You or I, we get depressed,
we sit alone in our rooms,

40:32.800 --> 40:35.007
they get depressed,
they get on the Concorde and go to Europe.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.167
He left her?

40:36.240 --> 40:38.447
Yeah. He just wanted to get out there

40:38.520 --> 40:40.807
and pack up everything
that might remind you of her

40:41.080 --> 40:43.560
so that when you went out there, you weren't

40:45.040 --> 40:46.371
reminded of her. (CHUCKLES)

40:46.680 --> 40:48.045
He's alone out there.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.567
Yeah, and forlorn.

40:49.640 --> 40:52.484
I mean, that's the word for it,
absolutely forlorn.

40:53.080 --> 40:57.085
But there was somethin' he had to do,
and he's being a real brick about it.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.169
Oh, that's so sweet.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.490
Yeah. Sweet guy.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.086
They didn't like me.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.528
They did. They did.
In fact, the guys at the table next to me,

41:14.040 --> 41:16.566
they were very specific
about what they liked about you.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.681

59:49.120 --> 59:51.248
If... If I mail the empty box
back to my home address,

59:51.320 --> 59:53.288
- I don't have to pay any sales tax?
-What?

59:53.400 --> 59:55.164
That guy said that? It doesn't sound right.

59:55.240 --> 59:57.527
Tell you what, let me go back
and check, all right? Okay.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.442
- May you have a growth.
-(CHUCKLES)

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.683

Go ahead. Twenty gets you 40.

Come on, big time. That's not for us.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.690
No, no, no. That other fellow there
has been winning consistently.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.364
Well, it's a miracle.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.004

<i>L 'm reserved at the Grotto at 9:00.</i>

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.050
Christian, that's not going to be possible.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.960
- Oh.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.809
Yes, I see.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.962
- Uh, let me see ifl understand this.
-(JULIAN CONTINUES RANTING)

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.890
You are not able to do me this favor.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.611
<i>- Well...
-l mean, that is what you're saying.</i>

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.841

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.684
You cannot do what I've asked.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.686
No, sir.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.762

Look, my schedulejust cleared up.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.365
I'm happy to help, sir.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.602
How very fortunate I am. You're a prince.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.091
- Oh, Doug.
-Yes?

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.489

a copy of your prospectus

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.841

Definitely, sir. Right away, sir.

Christian, I'II handle everything.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.724
Thank you. Milton.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.884
Can I be of some assistance?

God, what do you want?

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.881
Well, the gentleman has been detained
by the histrionics of his mercurial star.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.968
- Julian's having a hissy fit.
-Exactly.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.327
Christian said he'd meet you
at the Grotto at 9:00.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.447
It never ends.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.931
In the meantime, it would be a pleasure

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.002
to help madam
with any of her shopping needs.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.286
Doug.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.761
No, Mr. Doug.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.764
Now, Mr. Doug understands
that madam is looking for something

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.285
in the area of intimate apparel.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.089
This is Mr. Doug's favorite area.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.447
Look, thanks for finding me,
but you don't have to babysit.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.646
I'm not going anywhere.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.245
Who said anything about babysitting?

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.810
Christian asked me to keep you company,

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.644
and I'm happy to do him the favor.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.330
It's really not necessary.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.007
Come on, I got the rest of the afternoon off.
What do you want to do?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.048
We are going to Italy.
I was gonna buy a camera.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.164
I got a guy for you to meet.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.242

This is a great place.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.567
Yeah, it's a dream of mine to be married here.

HEY. Why don't you jump in?

use some Vocal accompaniment.

- You know, I have this recurring dream.
-Me, too.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.050
Does yours involve Michelle Pfeiffer
and a carton of Cool Whip?

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.168
(LAUGHS) No.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.605
What's your dream?

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.802
I'm singing in an enormous hall.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.245

been like with 50,000 people here?

Give me a couple of days, I'll set it up.

Anything but what you really want?

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.241
No, I'm gonna get that too.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.209
What is it?

that's so important?

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.570
I'll show you.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.083
I don't buy anything.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.321
I don't do anything.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.967
I save every dollar,
and I spend every day working on this hotel.

If it doesn't happen,

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.724

The River House is good.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.528
Where do I check in?

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.762
Uh, right over there. That's the lobby.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.049

I grew up in a hotel.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.200
My old man was a cook at a resort
in the Catskills for 27 years.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.441

that Christian might be delayed.

God, no. No, Doug, she's my third wife.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.130

I just remembered where I saw him.
