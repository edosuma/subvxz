WEBVTT

00:17.851 --> 00:20.145
Sly is so fucking ripped, dude.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.522
Jesus Christ, look at those veins.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.524
I do respect Arnie, but he's over-pumped.

00:25.608 --> 00:26.776
It's not sustainable.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.653
But Rambo's got working muscles.

00:28.737 --> 00:33.533
Muscles you get building monasteries
in Thailand to atone for your sins.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.245
Type of muscles you get
stick fighting dudes in Bangkok for fun.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.749
And he rocks the fuck out of those bangs.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.293
Shit, kiddo, you don't have to tell me.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.337
And he wasn't afraid to flash

00:46.421 --> 00:48.590
a little caboose
in <i>First Blood II,</i> either.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.468
Mmm. Mmm.

00:52.343 --> 00:55.346
Hey... Keep it clean, Mom, shit.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.890
- I'll keep it anyway I like.
- Goddamn.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.726
And what I like is an action hero

01:00.810 --> 01:04.063
that's got the balls to show
his tight tuchus on camera.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.023
Arnold did it, too. Gotta give him that.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.484
- He did.
- And Van Damme?

01:08.359 --> 01:09.986
Almost as a rule.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.780
And Seagal never did.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.491
That pear-shaped poser
never had a tight tuchus.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.036
Oh, you'd kick the shit out
of prime Seagal, pumpkin.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.580
Fucking A, I would, Mom. Shit.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.792
- He's a commie now, by the way.
- Hmm.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.171
Is that your, uh,
Pilates instructor friend?

01:29.255 --> 01:30.089
Mmm-hmm.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.842
Plan on seeing her again
before you ship out?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.761
Nah, it's casual. Like, purely sexual.

01:35.845 --> 01:39.056
I know what casual is, dipshit.

01:39.140 --> 01:44.478
I just thought you might look
for something a little more substantial.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.231
It's a bit of a hard target
in my line of work, Mom.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.399
I'm here one day,

01:48.483 --> 01:51.528
I'm off to Canada for
a top secret joint special op the next.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.072
You know how it goes.

01:55.115 --> 01:55.949
Sure do.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.619
Hey, you ready for more nachos?

02:00.703 --> 02:01.621
You know it.

02:02.705 --> 02:03.623
Mmm!

02:05.834 --> 02:08.545
Fuck, yeah! Rambo's the shit, Mom!

02:09.295 --> 02:10.964
Why's this guy not our president?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.432
"This isn't your war."

02:21.516 --> 02:22.600
"It is now."

02:29.315 --> 02:32.943
Oh, come on, Ma.
You're gonna make the nachos soggy.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.320
Oh...

02:34.404 --> 02:36.739
Come on. Come on.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.994
I'll be back before you know it.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.829
Not a scratch on me.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.165
Damn well better.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.252
Fuck! Fuck.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.672
Is everybody okay? Maya?

02:53.339 --> 02:55.550
I'm alive... I think.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.929
Paul, what happened? Paul?

03:02.307 --> 03:03.641
Oh, shit.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.727
- The console's destroyed.
- He alive?

03:06.811 --> 03:07.812
He's got a pulse.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.898
How the fuck that crash
didn't wake him up though?

03:10.982 --> 03:13.568
How the fuck does he still have a hard-on?

03:14.152 --> 03:15.820
Comms check. Anyone getting this?

03:16.779 --> 03:18.739
Negative. Gomez, anything?

03:18.823 --> 03:19.657
Fried.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.492
My tablet! Thank God.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.247
Vulture's radio's dead.
I'm not getting any service.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.665
No signal.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.000
What the hell?

03:29.667 --> 03:31.127
Oh! Oh!

03:36.591 --> 03:38.009
- Fuck!
- What?

03:39.344 --> 03:40.970
I got no signal either.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.307
Shit. Lerner,
check your phone for service.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.437
Game over, man.
My fucking phone's busted.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.606
What the fuck was that, Paul?

03:52.690 --> 03:53.650
What was what?

03:54.150 --> 03:55.776
You destroyed the console!

03:55.860 --> 03:57.070
What? Why?

03:57.862 --> 04:00.823
- That's what I'm fucking asking you!
- All right. Back off.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.784
- Fuck.
- He might have a head injury.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.502
Jesus, your pupils are saucers.

04:15.797 --> 04:16.797
Where are we?

04:16.881 --> 04:19.550
We're in the middle of the desert.
We crash-landed.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.304
We did?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.431
Hey, he's high as a kite.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.558
I thought Paul didn't do drugs.

04:27.642 --> 04:31.812
He doesn't. No alcohol, no fat, no fun.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.649
There is definitely fun
in his system right now.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.651
My daughter's in Vegas.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.113
And fat. He said he ate
a bowl of guac at the party.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.450
- What guac?
- I don't understand the question.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.868
I saw him eating it.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.246
It was gross. It had pineapple in it.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.498
Fucking Hagerty.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.667
Hagerty what?

04:53.293 --> 04:56.587
His bomb guac is notorious
'cause he laces it with acid and shrooms

04:56.671 --> 04:57.630
and pineapple.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.506
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.760
Look, he's on the magic bus
till it runs out of gas.

05:02.844 --> 05:03.886
Let's focus.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.848
We need to get to the Russian compound,
find the nuke, and rescue Trunk ASAP.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.810
We're a few miles outside
of the objective. We continue on foot.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.020
On foot?

05:13.104 --> 05:15.940
Won't they know
that we've crashed and send backup?

05:16.024 --> 05:18.609
You can't track the Vulture
in stealth mode.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.736
We're on our own.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.740
Yo! Paulie, you trippy fuck!

05:24.449 --> 05:26.284
- Fucking Paul.
- Paul?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.535
- Paul!
- Paul!

05:28.619 --> 05:30.329
- Paul!
- Where the fuck is he?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.248
Should we spread out and look for him?

05:33.374 --> 05:34.750
In partners, maybe?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.210
No, there's no time.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.420
We have to get to the compound ASAP!

05:38.504 --> 05:39.922
Paul has survival training.

05:40.006 --> 05:44.135
Let's hope it overcomes
Hagerty's psychedelic chip dip!

05:45.053 --> 05:46.721
So we're just going to leave him?

05:47.597 --> 05:49.598
Here. This will help with navigation.

05:49.682 --> 05:53.102
- Stole it off the console.
- You're gonna let me take the lead?

05:53.936 --> 05:55.313
Relax, it's just a compass.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.232
- Ready?
- Ready.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.692
Let's do it.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.569
- Maya, we got to go.
- Let's go.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.781
This mission fucking sucks.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.519
Get your comrades to drop their guns

06:35.603 --> 06:36.854
and open the gate

06:37.563 --> 06:40.775
or I'll blow your brains out
through your fucked up ear.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.821
He won't kill you,
you're his only leverage.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.658
We can take the rest of them.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.702
Guns down.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.038
Let them in!

06:56.040 --> 06:56.957
No!

06:58.459 --> 07:00.419
Is <i>nyet</i> his final answer?

07:00.503 --> 07:01.963
I'm not going to ask again.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.757
Do it. Now!

07:15.226 --> 07:17.019
Head back along our approach vector

07:17.103 --> 07:19.563
where we saw
that military chopper go down.

07:19.647 --> 07:23.359
Make sure there are no survivors.
Take Poncho. Shoot to kill.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.571
If anyone's still alive out there,
it won't be for much longer.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.739
Copy that.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.492
Shall we?

07:36.914 --> 07:40.084
Let's go, sugar.
I'm gonna be looking after you.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.925
This fucker's heavy.

07:49.677 --> 07:52.846
This is a long haul, Chief,
and my body water percentage

07:52.930 --> 07:55.474
has got to be in the single digits by now.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.269
Won't be much good to the big fellow
if we're out of steam when we get there.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.443
Yo, you and and Trunk have been acting
squirrelly as fuck around each other

08:06.527 --> 08:07.945
ever since the party.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.615
Wanna tell me what's going on
or just keep gruntin'?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.038
All right. This is classified.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.997
At the party,

08:19.081 --> 08:21.417
Trunk said he wanted
to talk to me about something

08:22.126 --> 08:23.586
and I found out what it was.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.130
He's into dudes.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.176
I walked in on him in the shower
with one of the circus guys.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.262
Okay, so now you know.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.309
Maybe you can help me
figure out who these new players are.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.186
Anyone with the money,

08:41.270 --> 08:44.148
tactical resources
to go toe-to-toe with Koslov

08:44.232 --> 08:46.233
has got to be on our radar somewhere.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.360
Why aren't they?

08:48.528 --> 08:52.614
I guess someone's
not so intelligence... after all.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.532
What?

08:53.616 --> 08:55.576
It's a play on words. Read a book.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.953
- You done?
- Are you?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.496
All right, only gonna say this once.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.668
McKnight was a drunken mistake
and none of your fucking business.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.254
Cut the jealous junior high shit
and get your head in the game.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.505
You have a job to do.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.300
You were having sex in junior high?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.260
What the fuck you mean, "You knew?"

09:13.344 --> 09:16.930
Well, it's not like he came out to me,
he just didn't hide it.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.182
Why did he hide it from me?

09:18.266 --> 09:21.143
Maybe he thought
you wouldn't be cool with it.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.021
What? He knows I'm cool with you, and...

09:25.064 --> 09:27.066
He knows I love Queen and <i>Top Gun.</i>

09:27.733 --> 09:29.067
What the fuck, man?

09:29.151 --> 09:31.904
You pussies need a break?
Fine. Fine.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.990
I'll happily take lead for a bit.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.534
We'll be right on your heels.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.454
I love the shit out of you,

09:40.538 --> 09:42.789
but you know
the minute you let eyes on Trunk,

09:42.873 --> 09:45.542
you saw a beefier version
of yourself in all the ways.

09:45.626 --> 09:46.960
And he idolizes you.

09:47.044 --> 09:50.047
So when you're always talking
about getting pussy

09:50.131 --> 09:52.799
and you just assume
he's going to want to be your wingman,

09:52.883 --> 09:54.218
what is he supposed to do?

09:55.386 --> 09:59.056
Shit. I do talk about pussy a lot.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.724
Oh, shit!

10:00.808 --> 10:02.017
Winters, you good?

10:02.101 --> 10:04.312
I am. We may not be.

10:05.896 --> 10:09.025
Oh, fuck. You gotta be kidding me.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.777
God damn it, Paul!

10:12.612 --> 10:15.573
Finally gets fucked up
and ends up fucking us all.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.784
Anyone know how to move a mountain?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.748
Hang on, Jen. I'm on my way--

10:35.718 --> 10:36.552
Jen...

10:38.721 --> 10:40.598
Service. Thank God.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.437
<i>Hey, it's Jen.
Don't leave a message.</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:53.944
She's at Caesars?

10:54.528 --> 10:55.404
What the...

10:57.448 --> 10:58.865
Oh!

10:58.949 --> 11:02.662
Jen, no. That piece of shit!

11:05.873 --> 11:07.208
Fuck!

11:40.241 --> 11:42.868
We're going
to freeze to death, thanks to you.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.164
Don't worry, Vladislav.

11:47.248 --> 11:51.293
I'm sure it's just a Siberian
Sunday stroll in there for your boys.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.005
Oh, no, it's better than the alternative.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.258
What is the alternative?

12:11.772 --> 12:12.731
Ugh.

12:16.193 --> 12:19.112
Why don't you take a picture,
you fucking creep?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.281
It'll last longer.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.911
Fuck you, you fucking fuckface!

12:33.544 --> 12:34.378
Argh!

12:37.923 --> 12:39.383
Wake up!

12:40.217 --> 12:43.220
Wake up! Wake up!

12:44.930 --> 12:47.599
It's your command,
but you're in my world now,

12:47.683 --> 12:48.767
and I am telling you,

12:48.851 --> 12:52.562
it will take fucking forever
to drag Hagerty over this shit

12:52.646 --> 12:54.731
- and even longer to go around.
- Agreed.

12:54.815 --> 12:58.485
And we're about a click away
from that compound as the crow flies.

12:58.569 --> 13:02.114
Without that raft, Gomez and me
can get over there pretty fucking fast.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.074
And then what?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.993
We don't even know who we're dealing with.

13:07.077 --> 13:10.789
Strategic calls will need to be made
and you're not equipped to do that.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.666
So I am going over with you.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.585
Gomez and Maya will take Hagerty around.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.711
You're kidding me, right?

13:16.795 --> 13:17.921
Not even a little.

13:18.005 --> 13:21.091
Trunk's on the other side of this
going through God knows what.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.759
We're low on resources and time

13:22.843 --> 13:26.430
and you want to send your marine sniper
who's trained for this shit show

13:26.514 --> 13:29.057
to babysit dead weight
along the scenic route?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.726
I know you wanna get Trunk back.
I wanna get him back, too.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.895
- Lana as well.
- So let's leave Hagerty here.

13:33.979 --> 13:34.813
Let's go get 'em!

13:34.897 --> 13:38.733
I'm not leaving our bomb tech alone
in the middle of the fucking desert!

13:38.817 --> 13:40.236
You left Paul alone.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.196
Paul was conscious.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.907
Hagerty is the only person
who can disarm the nuke!

13:45.991 --> 13:47.576
Once we have it secured...

13:48.202 --> 13:51.496
It's priority number one.
We fuck that up, nothing else matters.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.748
You have your orders.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.294
You'll need this more than me.

13:57.836 --> 13:58.670
Good luck, bro.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.839
You too. Good luck, Tech Chick.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.387
Are you injured?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.932
No. I fucking cut my hand in the crash.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.893
Let's get moving. Try to keep up.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.787
Good evening, sir. Welcome to Caesars.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.585
- Any special instructions for this or--
- Keep it.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.393
My daughter is also very promiscuous.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.287
Whoa! Big winners.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.206
Congrats, edgy. That's a fat stack.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.167
Hey, fan me out, fan me out.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.337
Hey, congrats, y'all.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.386
Yo, what the fuck?

15:29.470 --> 15:30.595
Where is my daughter?

15:30.679 --> 15:34.015
How should I know?
I don't even know who you are.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.560
Jen. Where is Jen?

15:37.144 --> 15:39.062
Oh, you're Jen's dad!

15:39.146 --> 15:41.523
It's all good, pops. She's up in our room.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.484
Take me there. Now.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.402
Okay.

15:48.238 --> 15:51.742
Captain Yung. Yes?

15:52.660 --> 15:54.661
No sound or I shoot kidney.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.080
Very painful. You no like.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.248
Understand?

16:04.838 --> 16:06.465
Come now.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.133
Both of you.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.136
Hey, yo! Party foul.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.931
Hey! Hey! Watch the jacket, bro!

16:22.648 --> 16:25.609
I thought we were...
supposed to be going around.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.986
This is barely an incline.
Man the fuck up.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.948
Fuck!

16:31.699 --> 16:33.200
I'm sorry, okay?

16:33.826 --> 16:36.954
I'm sorry you have
to babysit this dead weight.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.462
Look, I shouldn't have
called you deadweight, all right?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.423
I only said that because...

16:48.590 --> 16:49.425
You are.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.593
I'm just worried about Trunk

16:51.677 --> 16:53.846
and pissed at Winters
for porking my program.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.182
She's probably trying
to pork McKnight right now.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.726
She's dreaming if she thinks
she'll milk another hate fuck

16:59.810 --> 17:01.061
out of that dick.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.980
Hate fuck? That's all it was?

17:04.064 --> 17:05.106
According to him, yeah.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.401
One and done. That's how we roll.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.991
Oh! Oh, shit!

17:15.075 --> 17:17.786
You wanted to smash pissers with Mac!

17:17.870 --> 17:19.454
- Smash what?
- Yeah!

17:19.538 --> 17:22.916
Ew! No. No, stop it. Stop. Okay, maybe.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.378
I mean, have you seen those abs?

17:26.462 --> 17:27.295
'Course I have.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.339
Guy never met a shirt
he didn't want to peel off.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.718
Listen, he's way the fuck ahead of us now
with only Winters for backup.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.721
So unless you want them
to have all the fun, get your ass moving.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.307
Let's go. <i>Vamos.</i>

17:41.685 --> 17:43.604
Holy shit. Hagerty!

17:52.446 --> 17:55.532
Can you check your phone?
There might be service up this high.

17:58.118 --> 17:58.952
Negative.

17:59.828 --> 18:00.704
Fuck!

18:00.788 --> 18:04.166
I was supposed to check in with Langdon
on the hour. It's already half past.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.335
He's liable to expect the worst.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.004
Fucking A.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.423
Send in the rest of my SEALs.
Send in the Marines.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.299
Send in the fucking Space Force.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.635
Sends in anyone without knowing the score,

18:15.719 --> 18:18.722
they might spook our new friends
into setting off a nuke.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.601
We don't know the first thing
about them or their agenda.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.771
They're ex-military. Most definitely ours.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.647
What makes you say that?

18:27.731 --> 18:28.732
The way they fought.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.402
Their exfil cover was by our book.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.782
Yeah... I'm more than just a pretty face.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.492
And I would know a lot more too

18:39.576 --> 18:41.829
if you would let me
take Litvin when I wanted.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.831
Or you would have
gotten nothing out of him.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.334
We'd have no intel on this new faction,

18:48.418 --> 18:50.462
no fucking clue where the nuke is,

18:50.546 --> 18:52.714
and we'd be worse off
than we are right now.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.424
Guess again.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.053
Fuck me.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.639
Tried that already.
Didn't get us anywhere.

19:07.604 --> 19:08.772
Ah! Shit.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.109
- Where are we?
- In a sauna.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.904
I'm pretty sure
we're at the Russians' home base.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.323
Those other guys kidnapped us
and locked us here.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.533
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.787
It's okay. I know I'm not your type.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.248
What? You aren't?

19:27.332 --> 19:30.377
You haven't eye-fucked me once
since we met.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.589
More than I can say
for your commando buddies.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.215
Huh.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.509
Ain't that some shit.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.928
We just met...
You already know things about me

19:40.012 --> 19:42.347
that my best friend
just learned about tonight...

19:42.431 --> 19:44.016
- by accident.
- Oh!

19:44.808 --> 19:46.893
That's why he was being so weird earlier?

19:46.977 --> 19:49.479
He's trying too hard
to prove he's cool with it.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.773
He's not?

19:53.692 --> 19:54.860
McKnight just...

19:56.195 --> 19:59.573
looks at things and people
through a narrow scope.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.785
But I can count on one thing.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.996
He won't leave us here to die.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.917
Rescue ops are underway as we speak.
I can guarantee that.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.460
About that...

20:12.252 --> 20:14.504
they already came after us
in your helicopter.

20:15.964 --> 20:16.882
It crashed.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.427
No.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.181
We've been through worse
and made it on the other side.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.892
We're going to get through this.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.144
- All of us.
- Careful.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.062
This pervy guard
comes by every few minutes

20:31.146 --> 20:32.897
to keep an eye on us. Mostly me.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.233
Well, it's clear for now.

20:40.864 --> 20:41.698
Fuck!

20:42.783 --> 20:45.285
It's okay.
It was actually a really good try.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.671
We're not going to die in here.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.890
Incredible.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.559
You must send my regards to Mr. Koslov,

21:10.310 --> 21:12.062
if you live to see him again.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.902
I am the only one with the entry code.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.030
So now what will you do?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.866
Have your men break me for it?

21:25.701 --> 21:28.787
Or you can negotiate as businessmen.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.582
- Hmm. Quite a pickle.
- Mmm.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.752
But I've got a third option in mind.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.714
- Get me Mr. Dugan.
- Yes, sir.

21:40.882 --> 21:44.303
<i>Where is Vladislav Litvin?</i>

21:45.345 --> 21:46.221
You know him.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.807
Russian, this high.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.477
One ear not so good.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.360
Ow! Fuck, man!

22:01.069 --> 22:03.404
Tell me where your team is holding Vlad,

22:03.488 --> 22:04.614
and I punch no more.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.996
I don't know any Vlad Litvin.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.122
And I'm not on any team.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.249
Please.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.003
We spot American military
from so many kilometers away.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.548
Kilometers like miles, but make sense.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.592
So stop telling lies.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.136
Hey, uh, he's not lying, guy.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.931
He's just here to find his daughter.
I'm her boyfriend.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.934
We don't like to put labels on it.
We're dabbling in poly--

22:35.979 --> 22:37.064
Daughter?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.191
I bring her here,

22:39.816 --> 22:42.235
you'll start telling some truth, I think.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.881
Bacchanalia Suite.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.093
You motherfucker.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.805
I won't be long.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.395
Ow! Can you stop?

23:26.863 --> 23:28.240
You're fucking dead.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.335
Oh! Face!

23:44.631 --> 23:46.341
Kick him in the dick. The dick!

23:55.100 --> 23:55.934
Yes!

23:58.186 --> 23:59.479
Oh!

24:05.152 --> 24:07.320
Bro!

24:16.037 --> 24:16.955
Yes!

24:21.751 --> 24:23.044
Know what we could use?

24:23.837 --> 24:25.671
- What's that?
- Helicopter.

24:25.755 --> 24:26.840
Ha!

24:26.965 --> 24:28.341
You ready?

24:29.301 --> 24:32.470
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.264
- Sucks, don't it?
- Can you see the ground?

24:35.348 --> 24:37.726
No, but I'm sure
it's down there somewhere.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.146
I'm going to suss out a safe route.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.815
All you got to do is follow it,
hold for hold.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.942
That's one way to look up my dress.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.319
- Nothing I haven't seen already.
- Fair enough.

24:48.403 --> 24:49.988
All right, let's do this.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.743
Ava. Hang on.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.579
You're gonna be all right.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.251
I can't hang on. Oh, fuck.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.503
- McKnight, I'm slipping.
- Ava, I got you!

25:17.974 --> 25:19.058
Fuck me.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.268
We tried that already.

25:20.936 --> 25:21.978
Didn't get us anywhere.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.113
Oh, Jesus, McKnight. You're leaking.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.699
I got shrapnel in the crash.

25:36.034 --> 25:36.951
It's no big whoop.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.452
Uh, some big whoop.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.830
We gotta close you up
before you bleed to death.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.374
There's nothing we can do here.
We gotta keep moving.

25:45.418 --> 25:48.296
Hands to the sky, fuck sticks.

25:49.464 --> 25:52.759
Who the hell are you?
And what y'all doing on my property?

25:53.843 --> 25:54.761
Oh, shit.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.267
And you think I'm dead weight?

26:01.476 --> 26:06.273
Thank God I cleaned his ass.

26:06.856 --> 26:07.690
What?

26:07.774 --> 26:09.192
Long story.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.321
Hey, you should just go on without me.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.656
I can stay here with Hagerty and the raft

26:15.740 --> 26:18.451
and you'll be free to Marine raid
the Russian compound.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.786
There's enough room.
It's not like <i>Titanic.</i>

26:20.870 --> 26:24.207
I can just curl up,
take a nap, wait 'til you get back.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.542
No deal, Lerner. Off your ass, let's go!

26:26.626 --> 26:28.836
What for?

26:28.920 --> 26:32.256
There's nothing I can do without
my tablet, phone, or laptop.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.176
Just like there's nothing I could do
to stop Litvin.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.306
I'm just Tech Chick, without any tech...

26:40.223 --> 26:41.224
I'm just chick.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.936
Yeah, well, I missed Litvin, too...

26:45.478 --> 26:47.439
And I had a shot at the guy
who grabbed Trunk,

26:48.523 --> 26:50.817
but my eyes were doing
a molly dance to take it.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.279
You're not the only one
who came up short back there.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.948
Gomez, I didn't know I'm...

26:57.782 --> 26:58.616
I'm sorry.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.786
Shit happens. You move on...

27:02.787 --> 27:04.998
Which is what we should be doing,
so hop to.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.292
Okay.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.464
Lerner!

27:13.423 --> 27:15.007
You okay?

27:15.091 --> 27:17.468
I think so. Where am I?

27:17.552 --> 27:18.386
I don't know.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.389
Must be some old mining shaft.
Can you get out?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.183
I can't see anything!

27:27.687 --> 27:31.566
Fuck! I skinned my knee.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.651
Gomez?

27:36.029 --> 27:37.072
Hello?

27:39.908 --> 27:40.784
Heads-up!

27:55.173 --> 27:56.883
- You hear that?
- Coyote?

27:58.385 --> 27:59.260
Hope not.

28:00.970 --> 28:04.056
<i>No visual contact yet,
but we might have heard signs of life.</i>

28:04.140 --> 28:06.267
Okay, well, hunt 'em down.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.228
Ah! There he is.

28:09.312 --> 28:11.897
Mr. Dugan, this is Vlad.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.774
Vlad is a businessman.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.693
Vlad, this is Mr. Dugan.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.029
He's my explosives expert.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.114
You are going to blow the door?

28:20.198 --> 28:21.324
Are you insane?

28:21.408 --> 28:24.618
Insane? Depends on who you ask.

28:24.702 --> 28:28.873
But dedicated to my objective
and out of patience?

28:30.417 --> 28:31.417
Absolutely.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.056
Hot enough for ya?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.644
Come in and find out.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.189
You just want to fuck me
all of a sudden, huh?

28:53.773 --> 28:56.525
Honestly, I'd fuck you
just for the fresh air you'd bring in

28:56.609 --> 28:57.819
when you open that door.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.449
Oh, yeah? Convince me.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.373
How's this?

29:16.045 --> 29:16.963
You like that?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.720
Don't worry about him. He's worthless.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.529
Just a heads-up,

29:42.155 --> 29:43.615
I'm going to enjoy this

29:44.616 --> 29:46.200
a lot more than you.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.454
You never know.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.002
Did you call me worthless?

29:57.086 --> 29:58.045
Sorry.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.173
That's what you get
for thinking with your dick.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.758
- You ready?
- Yeah.

30:02.842 --> 30:03.968
Stay behind me.

30:06.554 --> 30:09.765
Gomez! Hurry!
They're creepy crawling all over me!

30:09.849 --> 30:12.101
I'm going as fast as I can.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.480
I think they're attracted to the light.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.774
It's a rope, Lerner! Grab it!

30:18.858 --> 30:20.485
Ah, shit. Okay.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.278
Pull me up. Pull me up!

30:22.362 --> 30:23.904
I can't. There's no leverage.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.906
Tie it around you like a belt.

30:25.990 --> 30:29.201
And walk yourself up
the wall of the pit while I brace you.

30:29.285 --> 30:32.747
Walk myself up the wall?
Who am I Spider-Man?

30:32.831 --> 30:33.873
Yeah, obviously not,

30:33.957 --> 30:36.417
but unless you want to die down there,
get moving!

30:36.501 --> 30:39.379
Get it tight, and put your
feet up flat against the side,

30:39.963 --> 30:41.922
and lean back as far as you can.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.424
Oh, fuck!

30:46.135 --> 30:47.053
That's it!

30:48.847 --> 30:50.723
Fuck!

30:52.433 --> 30:54.059
Get your shit together, Lerner.

30:54.143 --> 30:57.146
You're a key fucking member
of an elite fucking team,

30:57.230 --> 30:59.356
and the best fucking hacker in the world.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.859
If you could climb
to the top of that food chain,

31:01.943 --> 31:03.862
you can climb out of this fucking pit.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.659
That's what I'm talking about!

31:11.035 --> 31:13.496
Yes! Climb that shit!

31:17.250 --> 31:18.793
Fuck yeah!

31:22.505 --> 31:24.424
Holy shit. I'm alive.

31:28.595 --> 31:31.597
Hey, you're stronger than you think.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.310
No more tripping, no more bitching
and no more self-pitying.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.437
Ready?

31:38.605 --> 31:39.647
I was born ready.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.731
No, you weren't.

31:40.815 --> 31:43.234
Reborn. Been reborn ready.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.491
They drew first blood, not me.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.493
It's okay.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.704
You're okay.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.460
Oh, Christ, it's about time.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.921
Y'all can make googly eyes
at each other later.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.798
We have a deal. Do you not remember?

32:06.382 --> 32:08.926
I let you fix the stud

32:09.010 --> 32:12.012
and then you answer
my motherfucking questions.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.390
What the fuck y'all doing
way the fuck out here?

32:14.474 --> 32:17.101
Stud, you spying on me?

32:18.353 --> 32:21.022
Stud.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.775
That's what she calls me.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.444
We're getting hitched tomorrow.

32:27.362 --> 32:31.365
So we decided to treat ourselves
to a moonlight helicopter tour tonight

32:31.449 --> 32:35.160
and something went haywire
and I guess we crash-landed--

32:35.244 --> 32:36.537
Will you please shut up?

32:36.621 --> 32:39.623
Listen, you are a sexy slab of beef,

32:39.707 --> 32:41.000
but you're full of shit.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.879
Your turn, sweet tits.

32:54.555 --> 32:58.434
We're part of a covert Special Forces team
in pursuit of Russian arms dealers

32:58.518 --> 33:00.436
who smuggled a nuke into the country.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.105
And yes, our chopper did crash.

33:03.189 --> 33:05.649
So we're continuing on foot because,

33:05.733 --> 33:09.737
even though I am half drunk
and he is fully drunk and high,

33:09.821 --> 33:13.324
we're the only people who can
keep it from getting blown to hell.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.286
I fucking knew it.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.662
All them commie bastards,

33:18.746 --> 33:21.582
they just don't know when to quit,
now do they?

33:24.544 --> 33:25.420
Crazy Susan...

33:26.629 --> 33:27.463
at your service.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.798
- Did you say "Crazy Susan"?
- Yes.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.552
My ex-husband used to call me that,
so I am reclaiming that shit.

33:33.636 --> 33:37.514
Stud, that wound gonna fester
if you don't get some disinfectant on it.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.434
Stand fast, soldier.

33:41.310 --> 33:45.147
Wow. You read her like a book.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.733
It's kind of what I do.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.151
Noted.

33:49.610 --> 33:53.405
Ah! I wouldn't have guessed
battlefield surgery is something you do.

33:53.489 --> 33:55.533
- Where'd you pick that up?
- Battlefield.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.828
They don't all look the same, you know?

34:00.121 --> 34:00.997
Fair enough.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.126
Yeah, that's gonna leave a gnarly scar.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.836
Don't beat yourself up. Chicks dig 'em.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.297
Maybe I should
just let you bleed out instead.

34:10.381 --> 34:14.593
Nah.
You wouldn't miss our repartee.

34:17.305 --> 34:19.515
Winters...

34:20.016 --> 34:20.933
What?

34:22.018 --> 34:22.852
Thank you.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.105
Oh! You're welcome.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.108
Just glad you're all right.

34:29.192 --> 34:33.445
And it's the least I can do
after what you did for me on that cliff.

34:33.529 --> 34:37.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I saved your life. You save my life?

34:37.617 --> 34:38.785
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:39.535 --> 34:41.829
Homemade shine. Old family recipe.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.540
Pour some of that on your gut.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.043
Or... pour it in your guts.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.630
Whatever blows that golden hair back.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.882
I disinfect from the inside out.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.426
Fuck!

34:57.345 --> 34:59.388
I really need
to get in touch with my boss.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.933
- Any chance you have a phone--
- Fuck no, I don't have no phone!

35:03.017 --> 35:05.269
You think I'm gonna let
the government tap my shit?

35:05.353 --> 35:07.312
Oh! I do have a CB radio,

35:07.396 --> 35:09.523
but all you can raise on that

35:09.607 --> 35:12.318
is long-haul truckers
who want to get a wank.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.486
If you're into that sort of thing.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.115
- I am into that sort of thing.
- Cool.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.034
Copy, thank you so much
for your hospitality.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.161
We should get to it. Can you move?

35:22.745 --> 35:25.873
Good as new,
but we're still low on fire power.

35:26.707 --> 35:30.962
Hey, CS, are you willing to donate
that Remington to our cause.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.134
Shit, hell.
I can do better than that.

35:40.847 --> 35:41.722
Booyah!

35:45.184 --> 35:47.687
Holy shit. It's Rambo's wet dream.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.231
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Fuck, yes.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.901
Killing mother-fucking Russkies 'R Us!

36:10.877 --> 36:13.629
Whoa! Whoa! Dude!
I put this on my mom's Mastercard.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.216
Ding! I always, get multiples in Vegas.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.510
You never know who might join the party.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.730
They trashed the place.

36:31.647 --> 36:34.692
To be honest, dog, it was mostly us.

36:46.537 --> 36:47.747
Oh, man!

36:49.498 --> 36:52.877
They broke my fuck swing!
I had this shit made custom!

36:57.465 --> 37:00.009
Say another fucking word
and I'll choke you to death.

37:35.419 --> 37:40.132
Hey, Big Papa, what's wrong?

37:43.177 --> 37:46.138
They took Jen, you fucking idiot.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.974
Shit. Where?

37:52.353 --> 37:53.729
The Russian's phone.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.899
<i>Yuri, we're at The Syndicate.</i>

37:56.983 --> 37:59.902
<i>I have the girl.
Bring the father and the moron to me.</i>

38:00.820 --> 38:02.238
<i>Yuri, you there?</i>

38:02.863 --> 38:03.698
<i>Fuck!</i>

38:04.532 --> 38:05.490
What's The Syndicate?

38:05.574 --> 38:09.286
It's an old-timey, Vegas,
gangster-vibe late-night spot.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.330
Just off The Strip. A block from here.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.706
Go down and call the police.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.042
Check, check. What you going to do?

38:17.336 --> 38:18.795
I'm going to get my daughter back.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.048
Ooh!

38:24.719 --> 38:25.970
Am I talking to you?

38:34.478 --> 38:35.938
Why didn't you just kill him?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.981
Who knows how many men are in this place.

38:38.065 --> 38:41.193
We gotta get out before they know
we're gone and call for backup.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.862
We can't risk being discovered.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.000
Why are you stopping?
Exit's right in front of us.

39:39.043 --> 39:39.877
Wait.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.675
- You are bluffing.
- Am I?

39:46.759 --> 39:49.970
Or are you simply underestimating
my resolve... again.

39:50.054 --> 39:53.598
You'd risk setting off nuke
and killing us all.

39:53.682 --> 39:55.517
Not if you give me the door code.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.853
Then I can just walk in and take it.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.481
It's your call. I'm good either way.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.233
The nuke is here.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.484
Okay. New plan.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.610
I'm gonna go down.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.696
Take all those guys out.
Secure the weapon.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.823
You get out of here and call for back up.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.284
No, I'm not going anywhere alone--

40:12.910 --> 40:14.786
If you're staying, so am I.

40:14.870 --> 40:15.996
You're stuck with me.

40:18.207 --> 40:21.168
Okay, but you stay behind me
the entire time.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.086
Okay.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.855
<i>♪ Yeah! ♪</i>

40:42.148 --> 40:43.232
<i>♪ Ah, yeah! ♪</i>

40:53.951 --> 40:55.952
It ain't the fastest rig on two wheels,

40:56.036 --> 40:58.288
but it'll get you there
quicker than two feet.

40:58.372 --> 41:01.124
Thank you, CS. We owe you one.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.044
Highlight of my week.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.796
- Oh, shit.
- Stay cool, homie.

41:07.673 --> 41:10.384
- You're letting me drive?
- Relax. It's just a bike.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.719
Thank you, Susan.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.890
Go get 'em, you sexy motherfuckers!

There he is.

41:53.385 --> 41:54.678
Dad!

41:55.262 --> 41:57.097
- Jen!
- Help me!

42:00.518 --> 42:02.102
What's wrong?

42:02.728 --> 42:04.939
Who the hell is that?

42:05.481 --> 42:07.650
- Who are they shooting at?
- Us. Behind me.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.110
Stay low, come on.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.159
Daddy!

42:18.118 --> 42:19.411
Dad, help!

42:21.747 --> 42:22.831
Maya, come on.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.714
- Dad!
- Jen!

42:53.529 --> 42:55.572
Now, you die.

42:55.656 --> 42:59.827
But first, I make you watch me
shoot your daughter in the head!

43:03.581 --> 43:06.292
No, my dude!

43:10.170 --> 43:12.214
Fuck, yeah, fam!

43:15.551 --> 43:17.177
It's okay. I'm here, baby.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.388
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

43:20.472 --> 43:23.100
Well, that would be a first! Wouldn't it?

43:24.351 --> 43:26.978
Where were you
when we were taking prom photos?

43:27.062 --> 43:30.440
Where have you been
my entire fucking life?

43:30.524 --> 43:31.483
I'm so sorry!

43:31.567 --> 43:34.653
Honey, I'm sorry!
Daddy's here, I love you!

43:35.654 --> 43:36.488
Yo!

43:39.366 --> 43:40.618
What the fuck, dude?

43:53.797 --> 43:55.382
Jen... where...

43:56.008 --> 43:57.885
What is this? What's happening?

43:59.303 --> 44:00.137
Paul?

44:01.722 --> 44:02.973
Are you okay, buddy?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.274
Mac?

44:12.358 --> 44:13.400
Hell, yeah!

44:14.151 --> 44:16.153
And you found Captain AWOL.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.447
You guys all right? We heard gunfire.

44:19.531 --> 44:22.493
- Us too.
- Paul, you okay, bud?

44:23.327 --> 44:24.161
Where's Jen?

44:24.745 --> 44:26.204
- Who's Jen?
- His daughter.

44:26.288 --> 44:28.624
Hey, Paul,
remember that guacamole you ate?

44:29.583 --> 44:33.378
Turns out it contained large quantities
of psilocybin and LSD.

44:33.462 --> 44:38.216
So you're most likely experiencing
extremely vivid and lucid hallucinations.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.718
You're tripping balls, bud.

44:40.469 --> 44:41.803
I'm not in Vegas?

44:41.887 --> 44:43.722
No, you're in the desert.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.975
That's okay.
We're going to take care of you.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.520
But I stole an ATV.
I drove it to Vegas.

44:50.312 --> 44:51.605
He emptied the whole mag.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.565
What the hell
are you shootin' at, Air Force?

44:53.649 --> 44:55.608
Russians. I killed them all.

44:55.692 --> 44:57.652
What's up? You okay? What happened?

44:57.736 --> 44:58.903
Yeah. It's nothing.

44:58.987 --> 45:01.824
How do I know
this isn't the hallucination?

45:02.366 --> 45:03.700
What makes you real?

45:05.411 --> 45:06.245
I don't know.

45:07.621 --> 45:08.997
Holy shit.

45:09.081 --> 45:13.252
Yo... Yung went to town on this shit.

45:14.086 --> 45:15.504
Paul has some darkness.

45:18.674 --> 45:21.176
Why do you smell
like whipped cream and crotches?

45:21.301 --> 45:23.971
That's... You're...
You're imaging that.

45:25.848 --> 45:26.682
No...

45:28.100 --> 45:29.643
Fuck yeah.

45:30.227 --> 45:33.522
Hey, Paul didn't hallucinate everything!
There's an ATV over here.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.775
- What? Holy shit!
- Fuck yeah.

45:41.029 --> 45:42.322
Yo, found the keys, Mac.

45:44.867 --> 45:49.120
See? I drove that to Caesars
and killed all the bad guys. I swear.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.290
Thank Christ you brought her back, Paulie.

45:51.790 --> 45:54.834
Now we'll be able to make up
some of the time we lost out here.

45:54.918 --> 45:55.960
Good job, killer.

45:56.044 --> 45:57.087
Okay.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.757
Bro, let's go get Hagerty
and get the fuck to that compound finally.

46:11.477 --> 46:14.479
<i>The explosives are all set.
Just say when.</i>

46:14.563 --> 46:17.691
At the risk of sounding trite,
last chance.

46:22.362 --> 46:25.491
American military
has captured Ivan Koslov.

46:27.242 --> 46:29.411
That is why our timetable had to shift.

46:34.333 --> 46:35.250
What's the plan?

46:35.876 --> 46:37.794
First, I'm gonna kill
the fucker in charge,

46:37.878 --> 46:39.045
then the rest of them.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.839
Then I'm gonna take the bomb.

46:40.923 --> 46:44.050
But, hey, if this shit goes south,
you get the fuck out of here.

46:44.134 --> 46:47.221
If they catch you,
you act like you're scared shitless.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.890
Put on a show. I know you can do that.

46:50.682 --> 46:53.143
And with this, if they come close to you,

46:53.227 --> 46:55.270
put the pointy part somewhere soft.

46:55.354 --> 46:56.647
Okay?

46:57.231 --> 46:58.148
I'll be back.

46:59.483 --> 47:03.654
If you could just wait a little longer,
you can get your bomb.

47:04.279 --> 47:07.073
You can still destroy Las Vegas
in a matter of hours.

47:07.157 --> 47:08.992
Las Vegas is just the beginning.

47:09.076 --> 47:12.746
Our plans are far more explosive.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.374
I suggest you get out of your seat.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.003
Fire in the hole!

47:31.848 --> 47:33.850
Don't fucking move. I'm taking the nuke.

47:35.435 --> 47:36.645
Trunk, help!

47:37.521 --> 47:41.149
So your gun goes down or mine goes off.

47:41.733 --> 47:44.861
Make your call now,
or I will make it for you.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.242
Fine.

47:53.370 --> 47:55.289
But don't fucking touch her!

47:57.874 --> 47:58.750
Ehren.

47:59.334 --> 48:01.211
Thank you so much for joining us.

48:01.795 --> 48:04.714
Your timing, as ever, is impeccable.

48:04.798 --> 48:07.383
Put Mr. Litvin in the freezer
with the rest of them.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.302
Yes, sir.

48:22.733 --> 48:24.150
We are behind schedule.

48:24.234 --> 48:26.570
We don't have another four hours to waste.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.405
Can you get the timer off?

48:29.072 --> 48:30.573
I'll have a look. Might take a bit.

48:30.657 --> 48:32.742
Oh, so you the head bitch in charge, huh?

48:32.826 --> 48:37.330
Well, I am the bitch with the nuke
and you're the bitch in cuffs.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.040
So, yeah!

48:39.124 --> 48:40.583
Sure looks that way, doesn't it?

48:40.667 --> 48:42.126
What do you want me to do with them?

48:42.210 --> 48:46.464
Find out who they're working for,
and how they know about the warehouse.

48:46.548 --> 48:48.800
You have as long as it takes Mr. Dugan

48:48.884 --> 48:50.969
to finish removing the timer.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.639
So... be creative.

49:04.983 --> 49:06.943
Get ready! We're almost there!
