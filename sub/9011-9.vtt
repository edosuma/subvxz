- Hey, Rick.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.257
I have to make a project for
the science fair this weekend.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.926
You think you could help me out?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.730
- Whatever.
- Well, I mean, traditionally...

00:11.804 --> 00:14.180
science fairs are
a father-son thing.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.058
Well, scientifically,
traditions are an idiot thing.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.643
Morty, I think it would
be fun for you

00:18.727 --> 00:21.479
to work on a science project
with your Dad.

[ cellphone beeps ]

00:23.524 --> 00:25.441
Uh...
[ clears throat ]

00:25.526 --> 00:28.194
Yeah, Dad.
Why don't we do it together?

00:28.278 --> 00:31.072
Yes! You backed the right horse
on this one, son.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.282
We'll get out the crayons,
brew some coffee,

00:33.367 --> 00:35.702
and knock this thing out
in two or three days.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.078
[ robot whirs ]

00:37.162 --> 00:38.621
[ monotone ] What is my purpose?

00:38.706 --> 00:40.873
Pass the butter.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.960
Thank you.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.339
Dad, I need a ride to work.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.216
Maybe Rick can give you a ride.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.093
I'm helping Morty with science.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.095
- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.639
Uh, anything else.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.641
What is my purpose?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.768
You pass butter.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.478
Oh, my god.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.522
Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.391
Since when do you have a job?

01:40.476 --> 01:41.476
Since last week.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.227
It's part-time at this
little vintage thrift store.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.646
My boss is this really
smart, eccentric old man

01:45.731 --> 01:47.940
that treats me nice
and values me.

Can't wait to meet...

Oh. Well, when did this
stop being Jamba Juice?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.452
I've just recently opened
for business,

You know my name?

02:03.081 --> 02:04.791
[ chuckling ] That's disarming.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.627
I also know you long
for female company.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.755
You know, it has been
lonely since the divorce.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.674
Some voids can't be filled
with Jamba Juice.

02:13.759 --> 02:17.261
This aftershave makes a
man quite irresistible to women.

Free of charge.

One never pays here...
not with money.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.434
Nothing to read into
there. Thanks!

02:23.519 --> 02:25.478
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. Needful.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.731
This is my grandpa, Rick.
He was just leaving.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.857
Huh.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.734
Tell me, Rick,
what do you desire?

02:31.819 --> 02:33.736
Eh, I make my own stuff.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.613
So, what are you...

02:35.697 --> 02:37.281
- What? Sorry?
- I don't know.

Are you the devil?
A demon? Leprechaun?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.330
- Grandpa Rick!
- Hey, I'm not judging.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.332
Just like shoot straight.
I'm a man of science.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.168
Ah, then perhaps you could
make use of this.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.311
Why don't we do a model
of the solar system?

03:07.396 --> 03:09.396
That's what my Dad did with me
when I was your age.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.898
Oh, okay.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.568
You know, Rick's in his lab,
making cyborgs

03:13.652 --> 03:15.903
and wormholes
and all that weird stuff,

03:15.988 --> 03:17.738
but this is real science.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.907
A man and his boy,
making planets.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.493
Hey, how about we use
a ping-pong ball for Pluto?

03:22.578 --> 03:23.953
And then Jupiter...

03:24.037 --> 03:26.539
Uh, actually, I don't
think Pluto's a planet.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.040
[ chuckles ]

03:28.125 --> 03:29.917
Of course Pluto's a planet, son.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.794
I learned that
in the third grade.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.546
Well, yeah, but you
know they changed it.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.506
Morty, nobody changed
the planets.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.925
I just googled it.
Pluto's not a planet.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.927
They changed it in 2006.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.638
Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.516
And I disagree.
- You disagree?

03:45.601 --> 03:48.019
That's right. It's possible
to disagree in science, Morty.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.687
Pluto was a planet.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.411
Some committee of
fancy assholes disagree.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.357
I disagree back.
Give me a ping-pong ball.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.818
Um, okay.
I-I just have to...

03:55.903 --> 03:57.663
Go find Rick and go
over my head about Pluto?

03:57.738 --> 03:58.863
No. Geez!

03:58.947 --> 04:01.282
I just gotta go
to the bathroom. Damn.

Okay, good.

Hey, Morty, let me [burps]...
let me [burps]...

04:08.749 --> 04:10.583
let me ask you a question
real quick.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.418
Does evil exist, and if so,

04:12.502 --> 04:14.170
can one detect and measure it?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.005
- Um...
- Rhetorical question, Morty.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.382
The answer's "yes, you just
have to be a genius."

04:18.467 --> 04:20.301
Cute. Your sister's boss
gave me a microscope

04:20.385 --> 04:21.886
that would have
made me retarded.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.679
Ooh.
Oh, boy, Rick.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.681
I'm don't think you're allowed
to say that word, you know?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.059
Morty, I'm not disparaging
the differently abled.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.478
I'm stating the fact that
if I had used this microscope,

04:30.562 --> 04:32.122
it would have made me
mentally retarded.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.565
Okay, yeah, but I don't think
it's about logic, Rick.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.484
I think the word has just
become a symbolic issue for

04:36.568 --> 04:38.986
powerful groups that are
doing the right thing.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.696
Well, that's retarded.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.573
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, nothing.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.617
You asked him if
Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

04:44.701 --> 04:45.701
- No!
- It's not.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.203
- Shut up, Rick.
- Whoa.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.871
I don't care what anyone says.

If it can be a planet,
it can be a planet again.

to develop this.

sell anybody, say...

A typewriter that generates
best-selling murder mysteries

05:49.683 --> 05:52.518
and then makes the murders
happen in real life?

Ooh.
- Be quiet.

Don't you want to make sure

getting?

selling...

ugly ladies pretty

06:00.485 --> 06:02.653

preposterous.

- BOTH: "So what?"
- Yes!

06:35.979 --> 06:37.563
So what if he's the devil, Rick?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.231
At least the devil has a job.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.983
At least he's active
in the community.

file a declaration

that Pluto is a planet.

Why don't we just make the solar
system with eight planets?

It's even easier.

just burn Galileo at the stake

If it's athletic prowess
you desire, Principal Vagina,

08:49.696 --> 08:51.488
I might...
- I'll take it.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.573
B-But I haven't even...

08:52.616 --> 08:53.656
Thank you very, very much.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.826
Great store.
Great place. Bye.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.703
Huh. Okay.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.623
I must say, Summer, I thought
your grandfather's outburst

09:00.707 --> 09:01.999
would have disrupted business,

09:02.083 --> 09:04.710
but this is the best weekend
I've had since Salem.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.712
Nice. "Wholesome Delight"
for lunch?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.714
- Is that the vegan place?
- Yeah, I love their soup.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.591
I'm kind of soup-ed out.

Mrs. Tate, is it?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.720
What do you desire?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.889
Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.641
Oh, is there a limit?
Everything's free, right?

09:18.725 --> 09:22.269
Let's just say you
don't pay... with money.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.271
[ both chuckle ]
That was perfect.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.273
You pay with the curses, right?

09:26.358 --> 09:27.858
Um... I... well...

09:27.943 --> 09:31.111
But, Mrs. Tate, why do you
want cursed items?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.821
Well, I'm going to get
the curses removed

09:32.906 --> 09:34.156
at "Curse Purge Plus."

You know, the guy on TV?

09:36.243 --> 09:38.202
[ door closes ] What?

09:38.286 --> 09:40.663
Have you acquired
creepy specific old stuff

09:40.747 --> 09:42.164
from a mysterious antique
or thrift store

09:42.249 --> 09:44.583
that gives you powers
but fucks with you

09:44.668 --> 09:45.751
in unforeseeable ways?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.461
Bring it
to "Curse Purge Plus."

09:47.545 --> 09:50.547
[burps] I use science to
UN-curse the items for cash,

09:50.632 --> 09:52.132
and you get to keep the powers.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.497
This guy got mysterious sneakers

09:53.510 --> 09:55.678
to make him run faster,
but guess what?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.554
He would have had to run
until he died,

09:57.639 --> 09:58.764
making them worthless.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.432
I removed the curse,
making them worth,

10:00.517 --> 10:02.726
like, I don't know, $8 million.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.978
See you at the Olympics.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.479
This eerily intelligent doll

10:05.563 --> 10:07.189
was threatening to murder
its family.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.607
Now it does their taxes.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.234
Everything's deductible.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.944
Don't pay for cool stuff
with your soul.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.487
Pay for it with money.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.823
You know, like how every other
store in the world works?

10:15.907 --> 10:18.075
We're located at First and Main
in Old Town.

Come on... come on down.

from "Needful Things,"

"Good Morning, Pluto."

10:32.757 --> 10:34.675
And a very good morning it is

10:34.759 --> 10:37.428
for our guest,
Earth scientist Jerry Smith,

10:37.512 --> 10:39.638
who's making headlines
with his bold announcement

10:39.723 --> 10:41.807
that is what, Jerry?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.475
Pluto is a planet.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.269
[ chuckling ]
Well, how about that.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.271
I love it.
[ cheers and applause ]

Morty Smith.
I'm Scroopy Noopers.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.817
I'm a scientist.
Can I show you something?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.694
Uh, I better not.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.155
Right now.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.114
[ blurp! ]

10:57.198 --> 10:58.866
The center of Pluto,
Mr. Smith,

10:58.950 --> 11:01.118
is made of a substance called
"plutonium."

11:01.202 --> 11:04.830
mines like these suck plutonium
up to the cities,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.124
where corporations use it
to power everything,

11:07.208 --> 11:10.836
from diamond cars
to golden showers.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.839
And the more we remove,
the more Pluto shrinks.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.841
[ rumbles ] There it goes again.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.468
Just shrank a little.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.719
But a few years ago,

11:18.803 --> 11:21.638
your scientists noticed Pluto
had gotten so small

11:21.723 --> 11:23.932
they couldn't even call it
a "planet" anymore.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.809
Should've been
our wake-up call.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.603
But the rich plutonians
won't wake up,

11:27.687 --> 11:30.481
and they love your Dad telling
everyone Pluto's a planet

11:30.565 --> 11:32.524
because that means
they can keep mining

11:32.609 --> 11:35.861
until Pluto goes
from planet to asteroid

11:35.945 --> 11:39.156
to meteor, and finally...

11:39.240 --> 11:41.742
poof.
- Um, a party?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.226
Is everyone in your family
an idiot?

11:43.286 --> 11:44.953
Well, for sure
me and my Dad are.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.789
[ sighs ]
Well, all you have to do

11:46.873 --> 11:48.415
is get him to admit that,

11:48.500 --> 11:51.001
and you could save
four billion lives.

11:51.086 --> 11:56.048
Yeah, you know, the thing is
my Dad's really insecure.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.301
Hmm. Funny.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.637
Mr. Needful, out of everything
in the store,

12:01.721 --> 12:04.348

What a waste of a monkey paw.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.505
Mr. Needful, how
could you even think of doing

12:36.589 --> 12:38.132
something so horrible?

12:38.216 --> 12:39.800
I'm the devil.
What should I do

12:39.884 --> 12:42.052
when I fail...

12:42.137 --> 12:43.387
You haven't failed.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.305
People like Rick
are making me obsolete.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.307
I mean, seriously.
I may be "the devil,"

12:47.392 --> 12:50.018
but your grandpa is the devil.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.478
I just want to go back to hell,

12:51.563 --> 12:53.203
where everyone thinks
I'm smart and funny.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.898
No!
It's not fair.

Everyone in this town
got something they wanted

12:57.277 --> 12:58.360
from you... even Rick.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.530
I was your only friend,
and I get nothing?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.491
Okay. I'll give you one thing.

the heavyweight champion
in 1936,

13:17.964 --> 13:19.840
and then you'll be
trapped there,

13:19.924 --> 13:21.341
winning the same fight
for eternity.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.302
I can take out the "eternity"
and the padding,

13:23.386 --> 13:26.013
and then you'll have some
time-traveling mittens.

of our inventory.

and do some restructuring.

"You win, Rick."

That was important
to you, wasn't it?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.110
Nope. Lt was important
to your dumb devil friend.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.820
To me, this was all just a bit,

going to give up.

and you threw your poopy undies
out your bedroom window
