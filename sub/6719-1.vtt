01:45.946 --> 01:47.363
Hey, Billy.

01:47.447 --> 01:49.198
It's Thursday.
Come back tomorrow.

01:49.282 --> 01:52.034
No, it's actually
Friday, ya cheap prick.

01:52.119 --> 01:53.244
Hey!

01:59.876 --> 02:01.335
Junkie putz.

03:17.954 --> 03:19.955
You gonna kill
me out here?

05:08.273 --> 05:09.857
Hey!

05:09.941 --> 05:10.983
Hey!

06:20.929 --> 06:24.139
And that so lamely
and unfashionable

06:24.224 --> 06:28.102
that dogs bark at me
as I go by them.

06:28.186 --> 06:31.271
Discounts on my
known deformities.

06:31.356 --> 06:33.482
Milagros.

06:33.566 --> 06:35.484
I give you heaven...

06:38.530 --> 06:40.072
And I give you hell.

06:42.450 --> 06:44.034
Hey, mister.

06:44.119 --> 06:45.744
I had some car trouble
out in the desert.

06:45.829 --> 06:47.996
I need to use
the telephone.

06:48.081 --> 06:51.375
One American dollar.

06:51.459 --> 06:54.294
Sure.

07:00.385 --> 07:01.802
It's inside.

07:01.886 --> 07:05.264
It's all inside.

07:05.306 --> 07:07.266
It's all inside.

07:07.308 --> 07:08.767
All your dreams come true inside this tent.

07:08.852 --> 07:11.311
Hombres, juanitas

07:11.396 --> 07:14.231
open your knees
and feel the breeze.

07:25.452 --> 07:28.328
Hey, brother,
you have a phone around here?

09:35.248 --> 09:36.665
Excuse me.

09:36.749 --> 09:38.000
You girls seen
this chick with...?

09:38.084 --> 09:39.293
Yeah, she's
over there.

09:39.377 --> 09:40.586
Thank you.

10:01.107 --> 10:02.190
What?

10:02.275 --> 10:04.443
Hey.

10:04.527 --> 10:05.986
What do you want?

10:06.070 --> 10:07.863
Sorry, I didn't
mean to be staring.

10:07.947 --> 10:10.949
Yeah you did. You paid
to stare. Show's over.

10:18.583 --> 10:19.666
Are you deaf?

10:21.210 --> 10:23.045
Are you real?

10:23.129 --> 10:25.797
What do you think?

10:25.882 --> 10:27.799
Well, I think no.

10:27.842 --> 10:30.469
All right then.
Get lost.

10:30.553 --> 10:33.138
Hey, hey. Sweetheart.
Please, I am lost.

10:33.181 --> 10:35.015
Look, I scream and five guys with tire irons

10:35.099 --> 10:36.642
come and beat you
into pudding.

10:36.726 --> 10:38.226
Please don't do that.

10:38.311 --> 10:40.228
My name's Nate.

10:40.313 --> 10:41.813
Nate Poole.

10:41.856 --> 10:45.525
I play trumpet
back in the city.

10:45.610 --> 10:48.236
Look, I've been up all night long
walking through the desert.

10:48.321 --> 10:49.946
All I want is a drink...

10:50.031 --> 10:52.699
and just a place to sit down for a while.

10:52.784 --> 10:54.493
I ain't gonna cause
you no trouble.

10:54.577 --> 10:56.870
I just want a place to sit down and think about

10:56.954 --> 10:59.873
what I'm gonna do.

10:59.957 --> 11:02.250
What kind
of music?

11:02.335 --> 11:05.337
Mm. Oh, what difference
does that make?

11:05.380 --> 11:08.590
Hey. Really
nice music.

11:12.428 --> 11:13.428
One drink.

11:28.027 --> 11:29.861
I'm drinking gin.

11:29.904 --> 11:32.280
A girl after
my own heart.

11:36.703 --> 11:40.455
Goddamn, life
is good.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.999
Hour ago,
I was a dead man.

11:43.084 --> 11:45.711
Now I'm drinking warm gin with an angel.

11:51.134 --> 11:55.470
So... mm... carny life, huh?

11:55.555 --> 11:59.307
Yeah, Chiapas, Durango

11:59.392 --> 12:02.644
yeah, the
full circuit.

12:02.729 --> 12:05.147
You ever been
to the States?

12:05.231 --> 12:08.066
No, I've never been
there before.

12:09.986 --> 12:12.154
Well, goddamn,
your English is pretty good.

12:12.238 --> 12:16.658
That's because of Sam. He, um,
he's from London, and so...

12:16.743 --> 12:19.745
and because of the movies, they, um,
the small-town theaters

12:19.829 --> 12:22.497
they hang sheets
on the walls

12:22.582 --> 12:25.500
and they show old movies
on Saturdays at night.

12:25.585 --> 12:29.004
Huh. How long you
been an angel?

12:29.088 --> 12:32.340
I'm not an angel.

12:32.425 --> 12:35.010
I'm a bird woman.

12:35.094 --> 12:37.137
I don't know, I, um...

12:37.221 --> 12:40.640
couldn't get fat enough or grow
a beard and I hate snakes, so...

12:40.725 --> 12:42.517
just nothing else left.

12:42.602 --> 12:47.105
Well, hey,
it suits you.

12:47.148 --> 12:49.357
Thanks.

12:49.442 --> 12:51.151
I'm tired of them, though.

12:51.235 --> 12:52.527
What's that?
The wings?

12:52.612 --> 12:54.070
Yeah, they're heavy.

12:54.155 --> 12:55.530
They hurt my shoulders
and my back

12:55.615 --> 12:57.157
and I'm just, I'm
tired of them.

12:57.241 --> 12:58.408
Well, why don't you just take them off?

12:58.493 --> 12:59.618
Why walk around in pain?

12:59.702 --> 13:01.036
I'll give you
a hand.

13:01.120 --> 13:05.040
It's not...
I can do it, it's...

13:05.124 --> 13:07.459
I feel like you should leave now.

13:07.502 --> 13:10.545
You know?

13:10.630 --> 13:12.380
Okay, listen, uh

13:12.465 --> 13:16.968
hey, thank you very
kindly for the drink.

13:17.053 --> 13:19.721
Are you going back
to the States?

13:19.806 --> 13:20.847
Yep.

13:24.393 --> 13:26.144
Listen, uh...

13:26.229 --> 13:29.064
if you'd like to get away
from all this, you know...

13:29.148 --> 13:31.650
you're welcome to go
back with me.

13:31.692 --> 13:33.318
No, I can't.

13:38.157 --> 13:39.199
You take care.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.142
Mm.

14:38.134 --> 14:40.468
Women.

14:40.553 --> 14:42.804
Uh-huh.

14:42.889 --> 14:45.599
You got
a girl?

14:45.683 --> 14:49.811
They're creatures,
I mean it, freaks.

14:49.896 --> 14:53.607
I found her
in the garbage.

14:53.691 --> 14:58.486
An infant,
wet and crying in the garbage.

14:58.571 --> 15:03.992
And I plucked her away
from all that and I...

15:04.076 --> 15:08.246
I gave her a home.

15:08.331 --> 15:10.832
Hey there. Uh...

15:10.917 --> 15:14.294
her wings...

15:14.378 --> 15:16.922
they're real?

15:17.006 --> 15:18.465
Hm.

15:24.013 --> 15:26.681
You know, man, I've been around the
block but I ain't never been around...

15:26.766 --> 15:30.936
a neighborhood
like this.

15:31.020 --> 15:36.232
Thank you.

15:37.777 --> 15:39.361
Are you trying
to steal my Lily?

15:39.445 --> 15:41.279
Is that why
you're here?

15:41.364 --> 15:45.533
It is, isn't it?
Well, so be it!

15:45.618 --> 15:48.703
Hey, man,
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:48.788 --> 15:50.622
I ain't trying to steal nobody, man,
I just...

15:50.706 --> 15:52.457
listen, I don't
want your girl

15:52.541 --> 15:58.338
I just wanna get the fuck outta this nut house.

15:58.422 --> 16:01.383
Jesus.

16:01.467 --> 16:05.887
Where's my Lily
gonna go?

16:05.972 --> 16:08.473
What is there for a girl like that?
I'm her family.

16:08.516 --> 16:13.061
I protect her
from the real world.

16:13.145 --> 16:15.563
Listen, Sam...
may I call you Sam?

16:15.648 --> 16:17.524
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

16:17.608 --> 16:21.569
You know things now, sir.

16:23.572 --> 16:25.323
What if word got out
the girl's for real.

16:25.408 --> 16:27.409
Wings.
For real.

16:27.493 --> 16:30.078
Listen, mister,
you ain't got nothing to worry about with me.

16:30.162 --> 16:34.249
I just wanna
go on my way.

16:36.210 --> 16:38.420
Hey, listen, lady,
I don't take kindly to snakes.

16:38.504 --> 16:39.587
I'd appreciate it
if you'd just...

16:43.009 --> 16:45.051
Fuck! Goddamn it!

16:45.136 --> 16:46.678
What the fuck?

16:46.762 --> 16:48.304
For a few seconds
before you die

16:48.389 --> 16:53.351
you'll see the future
with great clarity.

16:56.147 --> 16:57.480
Hey, get in!

17:45.279 --> 17:47.113
So after Happy kills you

17:47.198 --> 17:49.491
can I get your
record collection?

17:49.575 --> 17:50.950
Jesus Christ,
come on, Harriet

17:51.035 --> 17:53.161
you think I'd make
this shit up?

17:53.245 --> 17:55.663
No. Hey. You know,
some wandering Indians

17:55.748 --> 17:58.500
shoot Happy's guy seconds
before he's gonna shoot you

17:58.584 --> 18:01.002
you walk all night through the desert on foot

18:01.087 --> 18:03.088
get captured by
some carny freaks

18:03.172 --> 18:06.758
almost bit by a ten foot long rattlesnake...

18:06.801 --> 18:11.596
and then a beautiful and mysterious girl

18:14.433 --> 18:15.266
You're enjoying
this, huh?

18:15.351 --> 18:20.230
Jesus, Nate. You fucked his wife.
Everybody knows.

18:23.818 --> 18:26.319
Nate... are
you there?

18:26.403 --> 18:28.321
Are you... are you
listening to me?

18:39.250 --> 18:43.002
Oh, Jesus Christ,
listen... hold...

18:43.087 --> 18:45.046
Hey, listen.
You tell Happy...

18:45.131 --> 18:46.464
set up a
meeting tomorrow.

18:46.549 --> 18:48.007
A meeting?

18:48.092 --> 18:49.676
At the Little
New Yorker. Lunchtime.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.303
You want me to just call Happy Shannon.

18:52.388 --> 18:54.305
Yeah, you call that prick
and you tell him...

18:54.390 --> 18:57.183
Jesus Christ. You tell him,
bring a million dollars.

18:57.268 --> 18:59.269
Nate?
Nate?

18:59.353 --> 19:00.895
Hey, kid, can I borrow
that camera for a second?

19:00.980 --> 19:03.982
You're a dead man.

19:13.659 --> 19:15.368
Wow!
Goddamn!

19:15.452 --> 19:17.996
Did you see? Did you see?
I flew, I did, I flew.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.497
Man, I didn't
think you could.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.040
I can't.
I'm too big.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.168
I'm too heavy for these to carry me

19:23.252 --> 19:26.754
but sometimes when the wind is,
is strong enough...

19:26.839 --> 19:28.756
Wait, I gotta get a picture of this.

19:28.841 --> 19:30.300
Okay, but if
I don't like these

19:30.384 --> 19:33.261
you're gonna throw
them away, okay?

19:33.345 --> 19:35.013
I swear to God.

19:35.055 --> 19:36.347
Just stand right over there by the way.

19:36.432 --> 19:37.515
You promise?

19:37.558 --> 19:38.516
I swear!

19:44.023 --> 19:45.190
Oh, just like that.

19:45.274 --> 19:46.357
Oh.

19:48.110 --> 19:50.111
I don't believe it.

20:03.209 --> 20:05.376
So what happened to you
out in the desert?

20:05.419 --> 20:08.713
Oh. Son of a bitch
tried to kill me.

20:11.425 --> 20:12.884
Over a woman?

20:12.927 --> 20:15.803
What else?

20:15.888 --> 20:19.182
Did you love her?

20:19.266 --> 20:21.476
Absolutely not.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.395
Hm. That's
kind of sad.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.065
How about you?

20:27.107 --> 20:30.276
Fast carny life.

20:30.361 --> 20:32.153
Beautiful gal.

20:32.238 --> 20:34.072
You must have your share of men.

20:38.994 --> 20:43.831
How come you
ran away?

20:43.916 --> 20:47.126
It was time
to leave the nest.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.586
Time to leave the nest.

20:48.671 --> 20:52.173
How about a bite
of that apple?

20:52.258 --> 20:53.424
You steer?

21:04.478 --> 21:08.690
You are a pretty
little thing. Hm?

21:08.774 --> 21:10.483
Thank you.

21:10.567 --> 21:12.443
Thank your
mother and father.

21:12.486 --> 21:14.779
I got it.

21:14.822 --> 21:16.572
Can I have my apple back?

21:53.777 --> 21:55.820
Full bath.
Twin beds.

21:55.904 --> 21:58.656
And I can get you pizza delivered till eleven p.m.

21:58.741 --> 22:00.074
Oh, that would
be heavenly.

22:03.787 --> 22:06.247
She's a knockout,
Nate. A knockout.

22:06.332 --> 22:08.082
Listen. I
appreciate it.

22:08.167 --> 22:11.419
Sure. You know,
even with the hump.

22:11.503 --> 22:12.962
Know what
I mean?

22:46.663 --> 22:49.123
You ever smell
the ocean?

22:49.208 --> 22:53.461
Sure. Yeah, I used
to work at this joint.

22:53.545 --> 22:57.799
A funky little place
right on the beach.

22:57.883 --> 23:01.761
Have you ever
seen the ocean?

23:01.845 --> 23:02.720
Never?

23:02.805 --> 23:03.388
Uh-uh.

23:03.472 --> 23:05.181
You ain't never
seen the ocean?

23:05.224 --> 23:05.973
No.

23:07.810 --> 23:10.728
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna take you to this place...

23:10.771 --> 23:13.898
way up close you can see the
dolphins swimming all day long.

23:13.941 --> 23:15.942
Would you like
to do that?

23:16.026 --> 23:18.653
Yeah, I'd like
to see that.

23:18.737 --> 23:20.738
It's really beautiful.

23:25.035 --> 23:26.244
You okay?

23:26.286 --> 23:28.121
Yeah.

23:28.205 --> 23:29.664
It's the wind.

23:32.126 --> 23:35.795
I'm sorry. I must
look awful.

23:35.879 --> 23:39.507
Sweetheart, you could
never look really bad.

23:42.052 --> 23:44.095
Hoo.

23:44.138 --> 23:46.931
My back hurts.

23:48.684 --> 23:50.435
You, um...

23:50.519 --> 23:52.687
you think it'd be okay if I took my coat off?

23:52.771 --> 23:56.691
'Cause that
would really help.

23:56.775 --> 23:58.151
Sure. Come here.

24:04.324 --> 24:06.367
Mm.

24:06.452 --> 24:08.369
Holy shit.

24:08.454 --> 24:12.373
I'm telling you,
I'm never gonna get used to this.

24:12.458 --> 24:13.583
Wow.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.461
Nobody asked
you to.

24:16.503 --> 24:17.795
Hey, I didn't
mean it like that.

24:17.838 --> 24:19.046
It's fine.

25:00.881 --> 25:03.549
Hey, I, uh...

25:03.634 --> 25:06.511
I said something
wrong to you.

25:06.553 --> 25:08.513
I'm... I'm sorry.

25:13.769 --> 25:15.937
I know what I am, Nate.

26:42.274 --> 26:43.774
Ah, fuck.

26:48.905 --> 26:50.323
Oh, fuck.

26:50.407 --> 26:52.491
She split, man.

26:52.576 --> 26:54.076
She what?

26:54.161 --> 26:56.162
Your honey, she left
a few hours ago.

26:56.246 --> 26:56.871
Fuck.

26:56.955 --> 26:58.956
Oh, man, what do you
mean she split?

26:59.041 --> 27:00.833
I mean she went
into the office

27:00.917 --> 27:02.209
she made a couple of phone calls and then she, uh

27:02.294 --> 27:03.628
she hit the road.

27:03.712 --> 27:05.212
I n that old truck
you came in.

27:05.297 --> 27:06.339
Fuck.

27:12.804 --> 27:15.473
Anybody else use this phone after her?

27:15.515 --> 27:17.350
Are you a police officer?

27:17.434 --> 27:18.851
'Cause if there's some
sort of problem

27:18.935 --> 27:20.603
I should call
the manager.

27:20.687 --> 27:22.730
Dr. Rosenblum's office.

27:22.814 --> 27:26.734
Uh, yeah, hey, listen, I'm
looking for, uh, for my wife.

27:26.818 --> 27:28.819
I believe she may
be a patient there.

27:28.862 --> 27:31.197
Uh, the name's,
uh, Luster.

27:31.281 --> 27:31.739
Luster...

27:31.823 --> 27:34.617
She's in consultation with the doctor right now.

27:34.701 --> 27:36.744
Uh, what kind
of doctor?

27:36.828 --> 27:38.996
Doctor Rosenblum
is a plastic surgeon.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.076
Get away from her.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.203
Why are you
doing this?

28:19.246 --> 28:21.288
Please don't
do this.

28:21.373 --> 28:23.624
What, do you think that
I like being a freak?

28:23.709 --> 28:26.627
Amazing as she is,
it's not a normal...

28:26.712 --> 28:28.754
Fuck normal.

28:28.839 --> 28:35.469
Since when does normal win
a goddamn prize, huh?

28:35.554 --> 28:39.223
Lily. You're different.

28:39.307 --> 28:42.226
Please don't do this.
Please.

28:42.310 --> 28:45.896
But I could be like all the other girls.

28:45.939 --> 28:54.822
Never.

28:54.906 --> 28:56.657
I'm sorry, I think
I'm wasting your time.

28:56.742 --> 28:59.160
Sorry.

29:03.957 --> 29:05.958
I don't ever want
to hear

29:06.042 --> 29:08.294
a goddamn word
about this ever.

29:08.378 --> 29:11.255
Or I'll get your address
and I swear to God, Doc

29:11.339 --> 29:13.132
I'll burn your
house down.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.227
Thank you.

29:45.207 --> 29:46.457
Hey, baby,
you still there?

29:46.541 --> 29:47.792
I'm here.

29:47.834 --> 29:49.460
Listen to me.

29:49.503 --> 29:51.128
This ain't no
pact with the devil.

29:51.213 --> 29:52.797
'Course it is.

29:52.839 --> 29:54.465
It's your life
for hers.

29:54.508 --> 29:57.384
Oh, come on,
that's bullshit.

29:57.469 --> 30:01.305
So, uh,
being managed by a notorious killer pimp

30:01.389 --> 30:03.057
is gonna help
this girl.

30:03.141 --> 30:04.683
Hey, listen, sweetheart,
he can make her rich.

30:04.768 --> 30:06.310
He can make her dead.

30:06.394 --> 30:07.311
Come on, he ain't
gonna hurt her.

30:07.395 --> 30:08.062
Why not?

30:08.146 --> 30:10.648
'Cause I'm gonna
be there.

30:10.690 --> 30:12.566
Please. You can't
protect yourself...

30:12.651 --> 30:14.151
Hey, listen,
just cool it, okay?

30:14.194 --> 30:15.736
Nothing's gonna
happen to this girl.

30:15.821 --> 30:17.655
Happy'll never
even meet her, okay?

30:18.323 --> 30:19.073
All I'm doing is

30:19.157 --> 30:21.992
I'm giving Happy
a piece of Lily's future.

30:22.035 --> 30:24.912
All right? That's it.

30:24.996 --> 30:27.039
He'll make a fortune
on this thing.

30:27.123 --> 30:28.374
Okay.

30:28.458 --> 30:29.917
I'm gonna do everything.

30:30.001 --> 30:32.002
He's not even
gonna meet her.

30:32.087 --> 30:35.005
Hey, listen,
he's just gonna get his cut.

30:35.048 --> 30:37.258
She know
about this?

30:37.342 --> 30:41.011
Hey, she trusts me.

30:41.054 --> 30:44.682
Okay. She
doesn't get hurt.

30:44.724 --> 30:47.351
What makes you so sure she
can make that kind of money?

30:47.435 --> 30:51.772
I mean,
this town's lousy with beautiful women.

30:51.857 --> 30:55.067
Nate?
What makes her so special?

30:55.151 --> 30:58.279
What?
What makes her so special?

31:09.666 --> 31:12.209
Her wings.
She's got wings.

31:12.294 --> 31:14.211
Uh-huh.

31:14.254 --> 31:17.882
And I suppose you have
another picture of a jackalope

31:17.966 --> 31:22.595
that could be available for the right price too, huh?

31:27.434 --> 31:29.184
Are you frightened,
Mr. Poole?

31:35.066 --> 31:38.319
God, you should be.

31:38.403 --> 31:40.654
Listen to me.

31:40.739 --> 31:43.657
I swear to God,
if I would've known that that was your wife

31:43.742 --> 31:45.117
I'd never
woulda touched her.

31:45.201 --> 31:47.077
I don't have
a wife, Mr. Poole.

31:47.162 --> 31:49.413
I'm a widower.

31:49.497 --> 31:51.790
Yeah. Very sudden.

31:57.255 --> 32:01.133
Listen, hey man,
I know you want me dead, okay?

32:01.217 --> 32:03.510
I don't wanna die.

32:03.595 --> 32:05.346
I swear to God
this girl is for real.

32:05.430 --> 32:07.598
I mean, I don't get it,
I don't understand it

32:07.682 --> 32:12.478
it's something freaky,
she's some kind of goddamn freak of nature.

32:12.562 --> 32:13.896
But she has wings.

32:23.740 --> 32:25.532
So I get the angel...

32:25.617 --> 32:29.119
and you get
your life.

32:29.162 --> 32:34.625
Sounds... religious.

32:34.709 --> 32:37.711
No, it's... it's
a little different.

32:37.796 --> 32:39.546
I was thinking more
you get a percent

32:39.631 --> 32:43.300
you get like 65, 75%.

32:43.385 --> 32:48.138
You get your piece and then I get,
I get my end, which is 20, 25%.

32:48.181 --> 32:53.811
And I get my life.

32:53.853 --> 32:55.312
And the angel?

32:55.397 --> 32:56.814
Listen, she's
not an angel.

32:56.898 --> 32:58.023
She's just...

32:58.108 --> 33:02.194
Theology aside.

33:02.278 --> 33:06.490
What's... what's to keep
me from just...

33:06.574 --> 33:08.575
blowing your
head off right now

33:08.660 --> 33:11.578
and taking the girl?

33:11.663 --> 33:19.378
Hey, man,
you don't know where she is.

33:19.462 --> 33:20.170
True.

33:20.213 --> 33:22.715
Until I get
Roland here

33:22.799 --> 33:25.676
to peel off all your skin with a needle-nose pliers

33:25.760 --> 33:27.261
and then you tell me where she is

33:27.345 --> 33:29.096
and the fastest
route to her.

33:29.180 --> 33:31.098
I don't know
where she is, okay?

33:31.182 --> 33:32.891
A friend of mine is driving her around in circles, okay?

33:32.976 --> 33:35.728
And if I'm not at
the goddamn phone booth

33:35.812 --> 33:38.439
saying all the right
things in 23 minutes

33:38.523 --> 33:40.357
he's gonna call
his cousin

33:40.442 --> 33:43.027
who's a homicide detective
and report my murder, okay?

33:43.069 --> 33:48.115
She's gonna disappear,
and they're gonna investigate your ass, all right?

33:48.199 --> 33:52.119
Happy, I mean, you know,
look at this like...

33:52.203 --> 33:53.954
making a whole bunch
of money

33:54.039 --> 33:56.081
and doing very little,
you know what I'm saying?

33:56.166 --> 34:01.712
Any idiot can fake a picture.

34:01.796 --> 34:04.298
I would need
to see her.

34:04.382 --> 34:06.425
Oh, man, no way,
you're gonna...

34:06.509 --> 34:08.135
I'm no fucking idiot.

34:08.219 --> 34:10.387
You're gonna snatch her
and kill me. Come on.

34:10.472 --> 34:13.431
You have my word.

34:13.516 --> 34:17.061
Hm. I have your word
as a gangster.

34:20.231 --> 34:30.157
As a gangster,
and as a partner.

34:30.241 --> 34:34.119
Okay then, then we
have a deal?

34:36.039 --> 34:38.623
You meet me at the opera house,
the new opera house

34:38.708 --> 34:41.793
six o'clock
in the mezzanine.

34:41.878 --> 34:45.005
It's a date.

34:48.134 --> 34:50.511
Can I leave?

34:50.594 --> 34:51.678
Please.

35:07.445 --> 35:10.114
You should kill
that fucker.

35:10.198 --> 35:15.327
Why the fuck did you make a
deal with that piece of shit?

35:15.411 --> 35:18.997
Wings.

35:19.082 --> 35:20.958
What a
wonderful dream.

35:29.384 --> 35:31.635
Do you come up here a lot?

35:31.719 --> 35:34.888
I come up here if
someone's playing that I like or...

35:34.973 --> 35:38.475
with someone
that I like.

35:38.560 --> 35:41.478
You know, I knew
who you were.

35:41.563 --> 35:42.479
What?

35:42.564 --> 35:43.689
At Sam's.

35:43.773 --> 35:45.732
I'd seen
you before.

35:45.817 --> 35:48.402
Your pictures.
Your albums.

35:48.486 --> 35:51.488
Oh.

35:51.531 --> 35:55.993
You were famous.

35:56.035 --> 35:58.203
Yeah, I was.

35:58.288 --> 35:59.830
Handsome.

35:59.873 --> 36:03.500
Now you're just
being mean.

36:03.585 --> 36:08.380
What happened?

36:08.464 --> 36:11.091
Man, I just couldn't
handle it, you know

36:11.176 --> 36:13.510
I just couldn't handle
the small talk.

36:13.595 --> 36:17.347
You know, the bullshit,
all the politics, that crap.

36:17.390 --> 36:22.352
No, I just
had my music

36:22.395 --> 36:27.608
and my dope,
and in the end it was all about the dope.

36:27.692 --> 36:33.071
And now?

36:33.156 --> 36:37.618
You can talk
to me.

36:37.702 --> 36:40.454
Yeah, I can
talk to you.

36:40.538 --> 36:42.039
You're different.

36:42.123 --> 36:44.625
Yeah.

36:44.709 --> 36:47.544
A couple
of freaks.

36:47.629 --> 36:50.047
Let's just say
we're different.

36:50.131 --> 36:52.758
Hm?

37:03.478 --> 37:05.604
It's five til.

37:05.688 --> 37:07.981
Fifty bucks the asshole don't show.

37:11.236 --> 37:13.695
♫ Been rocking in the morning ♫

37:13.780 --> 37:16.156
♫ Been rocking all night long ♫

37:18.201 --> 37:21.995
♫ Oh, rocking in the morning ♫

37:22.080 --> 37:23.830
Hold on. Hold on.

37:23.915 --> 37:25.832
This stage has
got to move.

37:25.917 --> 37:27.459
We got to rock
this theater.

37:27.543 --> 37:28.919
Mitch is going to be
here tonight

37:28.962 --> 37:30.754
with all them dances
and everything.

37:30.797 --> 37:32.506
We got to pick this tempo up,
change the key

37:32.590 --> 37:34.925
and let's hear it
one time. Come on.

37:34.968 --> 37:36.218
Put your soul in it.

37:36.302 --> 37:37.469
All right, where
is he, huh?

37:37.553 --> 37:38.011
What'd I tell you?

37:38.096 --> 37:40.430
We shoulda broken his goddamn
face when we had the chance.

37:40.515 --> 37:42.266
Now what?

37:42.350 --> 37:46.853
Excuse me.
This is for you.

37:46.938 --> 37:49.439
"Let the girl
do her job.

37:49.482 --> 37:51.525
Use the binoculars."

37:51.609 --> 37:53.610
Here.

37:53.653 --> 37:55.112
Thank you.

37:55.196 --> 37:56.363
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

37:56.447 --> 37:57.698
Who? I don't...
I don't know.

37:57.782 --> 37:58.824
Where did you get
the note from?

37:58.908 --> 38:01.034
Some guy gave me 20 bucks,
I don't know.

38:01.119 --> 38:02.119
Let go.

38:02.203 --> 38:04.997
Let her go.

38:05.081 --> 38:07.457
Beat it.

38:07.542 --> 38:11.086
Go do your job,
sweetheart, thank you.

38:14.299 --> 38:16.633
This goofy guy
is getting interesting.

38:35.153 --> 38:36.361
What do you see?

38:44.829 --> 38:47.039
Do you wanna
see my wings?

38:47.123 --> 38:49.499
No.

38:49.542 --> 38:51.668
Just ask.

38:51.753 --> 38:54.379
You want to see them,
just ask me.

38:59.552 --> 39:02.679
Okay. I wanna
see your wings.

39:14.901 --> 39:17.235
Oh, my.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.196
What?

39:21.574 --> 39:23.617
Put your coat on,
we're leaving.

39:23.701 --> 39:25.077
Go down there.

39:25.161 --> 39:27.746
They're parked
in lover's lane.

39:27.830 --> 39:30.040
Kill him and bring
her back here.

39:30.083 --> 39:31.333
Okay.

39:37.924 --> 39:39.549
Oh, no,
don't go yet.

39:49.435 --> 39:51.395
And now it is
an angel's song

39:51.437 --> 39:55.774
that makes
the heavens be mute.

39:58.111 --> 39:58.735
Hey, I'll tell
you what.

39:58.820 --> 40:01.988
Why don't you put on
your prettiest dress.

40:02.073 --> 40:03.240
Why?

40:03.324 --> 40:06.993
I wanna take
you out.

40:07.078 --> 40:08.412
To where?

40:08.496 --> 40:10.247
Trust me.

40:26.097 --> 40:27.597
Sit down,
look straight ahead.

40:27.682 --> 40:28.765
I have a little
surprise for you.

40:28.808 --> 40:30.851
Okay.

40:38.818 --> 40:41.069
I'll be right back.
You just wait right here.

40:50.580 --> 40:51.872
Keep your
eyes closed.

40:51.956 --> 40:53.373
Okay.

40:56.627 --> 40:58.170
What, what
are you doing?

40:58.254 --> 40:59.421
I'm right here.

41:18.191 --> 41:20.400
Okay, now?

41:20.485 --> 41:22.777
Okay. Now.

41:38.669 --> 41:39.878
Your first ocean.

41:44.175 --> 41:45.592
It's beautiful.

41:53.809 --> 41:56.853
You know,
you're really good at this.

41:56.938 --> 42:01.983
Mm. You ever
been married?

42:05.196 --> 42:09.741
Long time ago.

42:09.825 --> 42:11.535
What happened?

42:17.792 --> 42:21.253
Did you love her?

42:21.337 --> 42:23.255
I loved her to death.

42:28.886 --> 42:33.390
Hey, I'm sorry, listen...

42:33.474 --> 42:35.725
listen, little lady...

42:35.768 --> 42:40.063
what can I do for you?

42:40.106 --> 42:41.606
Play.

42:42.858 --> 42:43.900
You can play for me.

42:43.985 --> 42:45.902
No. Come on.

42:45.987 --> 42:48.071
You brought your trumpet.

42:48.155 --> 42:50.115
Well that's just to keep
the bottle in.

42:54.537 --> 42:59.332
Oh, come on now, don't take
advantage of me.

42:59.417 --> 43:02.127
All right. I'll play
you one song.

43:02.211 --> 43:03.211
Okay.

43:12.263 --> 43:15.640
This here...

43:15.725 --> 43:17.517
this here is Hazel.

43:17.602 --> 43:18.852
Mm.

44:38.724 --> 44:41.726
This is silly.

44:46.023 --> 44:48.358
Huh?

44:50.986 --> 44:53.238
It's perfect,
isn't it?

44:53.322 --> 44:58.702
It's like
a movie.

44:58.786 --> 45:00.620
This night
like this.

45:06.210 --> 45:11.589
I don't care if the ocean's not real.

45:11.674 --> 45:13.091
If you are.

45:13.175 --> 45:14.884
I don't care.

45:14.969 --> 45:16.636
Huh.

45:19.849 --> 45:21.474
Hey, Lily.

45:26.355 --> 45:29.441
Would you
dance with me?

45:29.525 --> 45:31.401
I'd love to.

46:00.097 --> 46:01.473
Kiss me.

46:08.939 --> 46:11.608
Come on, Nate,
I mean a real kiss.

48:48.098 --> 48:51.100
Her name was,
uh, Annie.

48:55.105 --> 48:56.773
Annie Poole.

49:03.489 --> 49:05.782
She was really special.

49:05.866 --> 49:07.408
She didn't drink,
she didn't...

49:07.493 --> 49:13.706
she didn't get high.

49:13.791 --> 49:16.459
She'd get high so she could be with me.

49:21.715 --> 49:25.385
I didn't do anything.

49:25.469 --> 49:29.055
I didn't do anything,
I just...

49:29.139 --> 49:31.975
I just watched her...

49:32.017 --> 49:33.977
I just watched
her fade away.

49:53.580 --> 49:57.834
So how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

50:04.383 --> 50:05.675
Nate!
Nate!

50:05.759 --> 50:08.261
Lily, Lily, stay...
Lily, stay there.

50:08.345 --> 50:12.056
Nate, calm
the lady down.

50:12.141 --> 50:14.934
Introduce us.

50:15.019 --> 50:19.522
Fuck you.

50:19.606 --> 50:22.442
Happy Shannon.

50:22.526 --> 50:25.862
It's a pleasure.

50:25.904 --> 50:28.531
You didn't tell
the lady?

50:28.574 --> 50:30.867
Ah, it was probably
an oversight...

50:32.661 --> 50:36.205
Our Nate and
his surprises.

50:36.248 --> 50:36.539
Yes.

50:36.623 --> 50:41.753
You see, yesterday,
over lunch

50:41.837 --> 50:45.381
Nate proposed that we
manage you, he and I.

50:45.466 --> 50:47.717
Your career.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.260
At first I
didn't believe him.

50:49.344 --> 50:50.803
A woman with wings...

50:50.888 --> 50:53.097
I'm sure
you understand.

50:53.182 --> 50:58.144
But after Nate set up the
viewing at the opera yesterday...

50:58.228 --> 51:01.731
Hey, I got
eyes, right?

51:01.815 --> 51:04.650
Listen, listen,
it was my only chance.

51:04.735 --> 51:08.071
I thought I could... figure
it all out and protect you...

51:08.155 --> 51:10.656
Nate traded his
life for yours.

51:10.741 --> 51:12.325
It's as simple
as that.

51:12.409 --> 51:13.701
Not true.

51:13.786 --> 51:15.078
Well, I'm glad
I could help.

51:15.120 --> 51:17.330
No, Lily.
Lily, Lily, Lily.

51:22.836 --> 51:25.671
Hey, let her put some fucking clothes on,
you fucking animal.

51:28.092 --> 51:30.927
Do I have to stand in a lit booth?

51:35.891 --> 51:39.185
You will have
an audience

51:39.269 --> 51:41.270
of one.

51:41.313 --> 51:44.315
Me.

51:44.399 --> 51:47.527
Now that I've
actually seen you

51:47.611 --> 51:50.696
you're a miracle

51:50.781 --> 51:52.990
too rare and precious.

51:53.075 --> 51:58.704
You need to be, like
Nate said, protected.

51:58.789 --> 52:00.706
You should
live with me.

52:00.791 --> 52:03.209
I will see to
your every need.

52:03.293 --> 52:07.296
Please, Lily, please,
just don't go.

52:07.339 --> 52:10.383
I want you to come to this eyes open

52:10.467 --> 52:12.969
willingly, I don't
want a prisoner.

52:13.011 --> 52:13.970
That's a goddamn lie.

52:14.054 --> 52:15.221
It doesn't matter to me.

52:15.305 --> 52:17.098
Lily, please, you don't
have to do this.

52:17.182 --> 52:19.892
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.

52:19.977 --> 52:21.978
I don't want
him touched.

52:22.062 --> 52:24.814
I don't want him touched,
that was part of his deal, right?

52:24.857 --> 52:27.984
Truthfully, that could
be a problem.

52:28.026 --> 52:29.735
We don't want him loose in the world.

52:29.820 --> 52:31.320
He's a talker.

52:31.405 --> 52:33.197
It was part of his deal, right?

52:33.282 --> 52:36.325
Yes, sweetheart,
but think about...

52:36.368 --> 52:43.207
He isn't going
to say anything.

52:43.292 --> 52:46.002
You and me
and women.

52:59.683 --> 53:01.601
Get up!

53:01.685 --> 53:02.602
Why?

53:02.686 --> 53:03.394
- Why?
- Why?

53:03.478 --> 53:06.439
'Cause I fucking said so!
Get up!

53:06.523 --> 53:08.149
Get the fuck up!

53:32.966 --> 53:34.050
Dream Lounge.

53:36.553 --> 53:38.471
What?

53:52.110 --> 53:54.612
It's Campbell's.
Drink it. Come on.

53:59.243 --> 54:06.290
Oh, God.
Jesus.

54:11.588 --> 54:14.131
I'm gonna get
her back, Harriet.

54:14.216 --> 54:17.927
I will. I'm
gonna get her back.

54:20.305 --> 54:22.098
Sure you will.

54:38.657 --> 54:40.449
It's not exactly my problem.

54:40.534 --> 54:42.535
I roll up here in the middle of the goddamn night

54:42.619 --> 54:47.707
to deliver 20 cases
of champagne.

54:47.791 --> 54:51.127
Oh, God, um...

54:51.169 --> 54:53.212
I... I'm sorry,
you're right

54:53.297 --> 54:57.008
I'm such a fuzz brain,
I just... um, it's next week.

54:57.092 --> 54:59.176
Could l...
could I just pull up and turn around?

54:59.261 --> 55:02.471
Right.

55:02.556 --> 55:03.889
I'm sorry.

55:07.394 --> 55:08.978
Thanks.

57:09.558 --> 57:10.683
I love you.

57:10.767 --> 57:13.144
Care to join us?

57:13.228 --> 57:17.648
You get dressed,
and get the fuck outta here.

57:25.574 --> 57:29.201
Hey, man,
she's coming with me.

57:29.286 --> 57:31.370
Okay. I mean, sure.

57:31.455 --> 57:35.833
Angel, do you want Roland to pack your things or...

57:40.172 --> 57:43.466
I'm staying here.

57:43.508 --> 57:49.722
I want you to go.
Just go.

57:49.806 --> 57:55.394
Hey. Hey, we're meant
to be together.

57:55.479 --> 57:58.731
Oh, dear.

57:58.815 --> 58:02.193
Now you're talking
in song titles.

58:02.277 --> 58:05.070
Nate,
you're a man of the world.

58:05.155 --> 58:07.406
Not my world.

58:07.491 --> 58:12.036
But you look as if...
you've lived a life.

58:12.120 --> 58:15.581
So you understand
that everything changes.

58:15.665 --> 58:19.919
Everything ends.

58:20.003 --> 58:21.921
Not this.

58:22.005 --> 58:25.674
Don't help me.

58:25.759 --> 58:27.051
Don't do anything.

58:32.682 --> 58:34.767
I don't want to be
with you, Nate.

58:34.851 --> 58:37.770
Please don't do this.

58:37.854 --> 58:39.813
I want you
to leave.

58:58.875 --> 59:01.877
Stay for the movie,
I don't care.

59:42.919 --> 59:45.296
As long as
I'm with you

59:45.380 --> 59:47.256
nothing happens to him.

59:47.340 --> 59:49.508
And that's our deal.

59:49.593 --> 59:51.093
I promise.

59:51.177 --> 59:53.512
You break it,
I'm gone.

01:01:27.857 --> 01:01:30.192
You can't bus tables.

01:01:30.235 --> 01:01:32.444
You can't clean toilets.

01:01:32.529 --> 01:01:35.030
You can't even
buy a drink in here.

01:01:35.115 --> 01:01:38.701
Not here,
nor anywheres else.

01:04:20.905 --> 01:04:23.657
My man. Hey.

01:04:23.741 --> 01:04:26.034
Mad Malcolm.
Goddamn.

01:04:26.119 --> 01:04:27.578
I'm liking the look.

01:04:27.662 --> 01:04:32.040
Well, you know.
Well, you know me.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.376
Footloose. Ow.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.797
And fancy free. Like
seeing a ghost, son.

01:04:38.882 --> 01:04:42.384
Word on the
street is, uh

01:04:42.468 --> 01:04:46.054
Happy ain't too happy
with you these days.

01:04:46.097 --> 01:04:48.640
Yeah, well, uh...
I'm still breathing.

01:04:48.725 --> 01:04:52.561
Amen to that, brother.

01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:54.229
I bet you could use
a gig, though.

01:04:54.272 --> 01:04:58.567
Oh, man, I could use
a lot of things.

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:01.904
I'm playing with some fellas at this thing.

01:05:01.946 --> 01:05:05.240
It's a party, you dig?

01:05:05.325 --> 01:05:07.242
Over at the museum.

01:05:07.285 --> 01:05:11.163
You show up...
play a couple of tunes

01:05:11.247 --> 01:05:13.498
they pay you like
a rock star.

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:16.960
Oh, museum? Come on, man,
that ain't my thing.

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:22.966
Yeah?
A hundred dollars a night sound like your thing?

01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:27.429
Hey. Get some socks,
don't get your feet cold.

01:05:27.513 --> 01:05:29.264
All right, baby,
let me know.

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:30.766
Yeah, about...

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:32.392
Hm.
I'm gonna be a little short to the gig...

01:05:32.477 --> 01:05:37.773
Think you could, uh,
let me hold twenty?

01:05:37.857 --> 01:05:40.776
That is,
you owe the pawn shop twenty, right?

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:45.030
Yeah.

01:05:45.114 --> 01:05:48.325
That's a pretty fat
roll you got there.

01:05:48.409 --> 01:05:51.453
You think maybe, uh

01:05:51.537 --> 01:05:53.789
you know, give a little
to the hat?

01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:57.000
Huh?

01:05:57.085 --> 01:06:00.462
Now don't let me see
you on the street.

01:06:00.546 --> 01:06:02.422
You've always been
there for me.

01:06:05.551 --> 01:06:07.302
Skate!

01:06:23.403 --> 01:06:26.488
Beautiful.

01:06:26.531 --> 01:06:27.572
Thank you.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.703
Mind if I stay?

01:06:32.787 --> 01:06:36.707
You can do whatever you want.

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:39.001
I'll stay.

01:06:39.085 --> 01:06:40.502
Okay.

01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:57.853
My real name
isn't Happy.

01:06:57.937 --> 01:07:00.230
Michael.

01:07:00.314 --> 01:07:03.191
My real name is Michael.

01:07:03.234 --> 01:07:09.072
Mike.

01:07:09.157 --> 01:07:15.370
When I was a kid,
apparently I walked around with a big frown

01:07:15.455 --> 01:07:18.874
I was a very pissed-off little guy.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:22.461
Not that there was
much to smile about.

01:07:22.545 --> 01:07:25.464
My dad named me Happy.

01:07:25.548 --> 01:07:28.759
That was his joke.

01:07:28.843 --> 01:07:32.220
I hated it.

01:07:32.263 --> 01:07:33.555
I hated him.

01:07:38.895 --> 01:07:42.647
But it stuck.

01:07:42.732 --> 01:07:47.903
You know, you can't keep
a good nickname down.

01:07:47.987 --> 01:07:52.407
I always hated it.

01:07:52.492 --> 01:07:55.410
Until now.

01:07:55.453 --> 01:07:57.788
Why is that?

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:12.010
Because it fits finally.

01:08:12.095 --> 01:08:13.762
I am happy.

01:08:18.684 --> 01:08:21.185
Happy, no.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:24.189
Diamonds, the
angel's stone.

01:08:24.273 --> 01:08:27.818
Well, if it's not,
it should be.

01:08:27.902 --> 01:08:29.778
I can't take this.

01:08:32.448 --> 01:08:33.615
Keep it.

01:08:36.243 --> 01:08:38.703
Some day you're
gonna be happy.

01:09:22.081 --> 01:09:23.999
Happy, where
are we?

01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:28.086
Heaven.

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:55.071
Happy Shannon!

01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:58.074
Man of the hour.

01:09:58.159 --> 01:09:58.950
Thank you, Anne.

01:09:59.035 --> 01:10:01.286
Nice of you to say,
but I really think it's the city's hour

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.912
don't you?

01:10:01.996 --> 01:10:06.625
But it was your generosity that
made this heavenly show possible.

01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:09.544
Well, it's for
the young people

01:10:09.629 --> 01:10:13.381
and, uh, I had
inspiration.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.178
Is this a new
Happy Shannon?

01:10:25.478 --> 01:10:26.978
Angels, heaven?

01:10:27.063 --> 01:10:29.147
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is, um...

01:10:36.822 --> 01:10:38.823
Is there ever
been a moment

01:10:38.908 --> 01:10:44.329
where you felt that you weren't getting a... a...

01:10:56.717 --> 01:11:00.470
Let me ask you about your two federal indictments.

01:11:00.554 --> 01:11:04.224
Conspiracy, tampering
with evidence.

01:13:52.685 --> 01:13:53.977
No, no.

01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:55.270
Come on Sweetie.

01:13:55.312 --> 01:13:56.688
Let's warm you up.

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:07.449
Now, wait,
baby, no, no.

01:14:07.533 --> 01:14:09.617
Shh.
Shh.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.162
Shh.

01:14:51.327 --> 01:14:53.161
Yeah.

01:15:09.345 --> 01:15:13.515
Last thing on earth
you'll ever see.

01:15:13.557 --> 01:15:14.682
Wings.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.195
I'll send Lily
your regards.

01:15:27.238 --> 01:15:31.866
Good to see you, Nate.

01:15:31.951 --> 01:15:35.703
I'll send Lily
your regards.

01:15:35.788 --> 01:15:38.706
I'll send Lily
your regards.

01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:41.292
My Lily.

01:15:41.377 --> 01:15:44.295
The last thing on earth
you'll ever see...

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:49.133
Wake up, Nate!
Wake up, Nate!

01:15:49.218 --> 01:15:50.718
Get up!

01:15:50.803 --> 01:15:53.888
Wake up!

01:15:53.973 --> 01:15:55.974
Wake up, Nate!

01:15:56.058 --> 01:15:59.936
Get up, goddamn it!

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:00.937
Get up!

01:16:03.148 --> 01:16:06.359
Good. Cold,
isn't it?

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:15.493
Stupid motherfucker.

01:16:20.374 --> 01:16:21.583
Lily.

01:16:26.255 --> 01:16:27.422
Nate.

01:16:27.506 --> 01:16:30.925
Nate!

01:16:30.968 --> 01:16:31.342
Close.

01:16:31.427 --> 01:16:33.011
Come on, get
your things

01:16:33.095 --> 01:16:34.262
we're going home.

01:16:34.305 --> 01:16:35.179
Don't touch me.

01:16:35.264 --> 01:16:36.764
We're what?

01:16:36.849 --> 01:16:39.767
I found her.

01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:41.311
I raised her.

01:16:43.272 --> 01:16:44.689
Happy!

01:16:49.069 --> 01:16:49.861
"We're leaving."

01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:55.199
I think that's what he
was trying to say.

01:16:55.284 --> 01:16:57.118
He's right.
Come on, come on.

01:16:57.202 --> 01:16:58.161
Why?

01:16:58.245 --> 01:17:00.288
Why? Because...

01:17:01.624 --> 01:17:03.916
You're not happy
anymore.

01:17:23.354 --> 01:17:24.646
It's open.

01:17:29.818 --> 01:17:31.569
It's a fucking
hurricane out there.

01:17:31.654 --> 01:17:37.200
Yeah.
Whatever.

01:17:37.284 --> 01:17:38.701
Yeah.

01:17:39.953 --> 01:17:41.579
You look
like shit.

01:17:41.664 --> 01:17:42.747
Got a smoke?

01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:51.047
You remember my cousin
Marvin, the cop?

01:17:51.131 --> 01:17:51.923
Yeah.

01:17:52.007 --> 01:17:54.175
The one who works down
in Newport Division.

01:17:54.259 --> 01:17:56.177
Told me that there's gonna
be a raid in a couple hours.

01:17:56.261 --> 01:18:02.850
Around five.
Busting a black and tan joint down on Adams.

01:18:02.893 --> 01:18:04.686
So?

01:18:04.770 --> 01:18:06.938
Well, I'll tell
you so

01:18:07.022 --> 01:18:11.943
a lot of stars, hookers, dope,
you know, whatever

01:18:12.027 --> 01:18:15.446
Marvin says that there's
a private club upstairs.

01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:17.198
Guess whose
club it is.

01:18:17.282 --> 01:18:19.033
Come on, Ricky.

01:18:19.076 --> 01:18:20.868
Happy's club.

01:18:20.953 --> 01:18:22.787
Oh.

01:18:22.871 --> 01:18:24.038
You know what
they do in there?

01:18:24.081 --> 01:18:25.081
Dope?

01:18:25.165 --> 01:18:25.540
Nope.

01:18:25.624 --> 01:18:25.957
Cards?

01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:26.708
Nope.

01:18:26.792 --> 01:18:30.002
Pussy. What the fuck,
I don't know.

01:18:30.087 --> 01:18:32.463
They watch some freak
in a glass box.

01:18:32.548 --> 01:18:34.882
Can you believe
that shit?

01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:38.219
These stiffs are paying Happy a fortune

01:18:38.303 --> 01:18:41.597
to watch some
naked humpback bitch.

01:18:41.682 --> 01:18:43.641
I'm not kidding you.

01:18:43.726 --> 01:18:46.185
I mean, fuck!
I'm in the wrong line of work.

01:19:09.918 --> 01:19:11.335
Caught you, you bad boy.

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.420
What are you
doing here?

01:19:12.504 --> 01:19:16.424
Oh, I'm a party gal looking
for a good time.

01:19:16.467 --> 01:19:18.426
Ricky filled
me in.

01:19:18.469 --> 01:19:20.094
Mm-hm.

01:19:20.179 --> 01:19:22.764
Nate, why are you
doing this?

01:19:35.527 --> 01:19:37.987
I have got to meet
this girl.

01:19:40.783 --> 01:19:42.366
Don't you all worry about this bubbly shit

01:19:42.451 --> 01:19:44.035
I got the good
stuff right here.

01:19:44.119 --> 01:19:45.203
Oh, hello.

01:19:45.287 --> 01:19:46.329
Have a drink, sweetheart.

01:19:46.413 --> 01:19:47.330
Here we go!

01:19:47.414 --> 01:19:49.791
We're gonna go inside and
have a good night tonight, huh?

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:52.460
Oh, yeah, yeah. Here
you go, brother.

01:19:55.756 --> 01:19:57.507
- Hey, Dan.
- Thank you, Dan.

01:19:57.591 --> 01:19:59.425
Please come in.
Please come in.

01:20:04.056 --> 01:20:05.807
Check your coat?

01:20:05.849 --> 01:20:07.225
Uh...

01:20:07.309 --> 01:20:09.644
Thank you.

01:22:30.285 --> 01:22:35.039
Beautiful, isn't she?

01:23:17.332 --> 01:23:21.168
Nate, what are
we gonna do?

01:23:21.253 --> 01:23:22.753
You're gonna fly.

01:23:22.838 --> 01:23:23.629
What?

01:23:23.714 --> 01:23:24.755
You can do it.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.217
I can't fly, Nate.
Nate, I can't fly!

01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:31.345
The wind is blowing just right,
you can fly.

01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:32.763
You can do this,
come on.

01:24:02.919 --> 01:24:04.879
Nate, it's not gonna work,
it's not gonna work.

01:24:09.634 --> 01:24:11.218
Oh, baby.

01:24:11.303 --> 01:24:12.470
What?

01:24:12.554 --> 01:24:14.138
I love you.

01:24:14.222 --> 01:24:16.932
Get over here.
You'll fall like a brick.

01:24:20.103 --> 01:24:21.729
I love you.

01:24:31.531 --> 01:24:32.406
Nate!

01:24:32.491 --> 01:24:33.783
No!
