WEBVTT

00:01.834 --> 00:04.600
Tonight,
the fight is on.

00:08.767 --> 00:10.867
We're going to war
it looks like...

00:13.233 --> 00:16.300
Kris is about ready
to get his ass kicked.

00:19.133 --> 00:23.000
These miners
are in for the battle
of their lives.

00:33.567 --> 00:38.300
On the Bering Sea,
a battle is brewing
between a heavyweight

00:39.200 --> 00:41.066
and a scrappy challenger.

00:45.634 --> 00:47.867
Kris Kelly idiot.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.100
waste
my [bleep] time with

00:54.100 --> 00:55.667
this stupid

00:57.734 --> 01:00.634
He's gonna mine here,
right where we're set up?

01:00.634 --> 01:05.100
After I've done all this work,
finding the gold,
he's out of his mind.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.533
Kris Kelly and tattoo
face, they are gonna get

01:09.533 --> 01:12.200
a rude awakening
about who I am.

01:13.033 --> 01:14.400
Here we go.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.667
Yay!

01:17.967 --> 01:21.033
Our operator,
James, has permission
to work on Tomcod.

01:21.033 --> 01:23.667
We're gonna go
where the gold is.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.433
I don't give a damn
what Shawn Pomrenke
thinks about it.

01:34.934 --> 01:38.467
This [bleep] stands
right now.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.567
You can't do this.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.000
I'm gonna knock you.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.567
I can't hear you,
you stupid

01:44.567 --> 01:45.867
knock you off.

01:45.867 --> 01:47.600
You know, you think
you can raise
your voice

01:47.600 --> 01:49.834
reach that far,
you [bleep] idiot.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.900
Read the [bleep] regulation.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.066
You got to
right next door.

01:54.066 --> 01:56.467
You need to read regulations.

01:56.467 --> 01:57.800
You baring regulation.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.867
You [bleep]...

01:58.867 --> 02:00.133
Read the [bleep] rules.

02:00.133 --> 02:01.333
You're right next to us.

02:01.333 --> 02:04.533
Read the [bleep] rules, idiot.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.000
I got you
like that.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.333
I did not do.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.166
- I've got you on lot camera
and video too.
- Pull your permit.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.767
Get the

02:11.967 --> 02:14.667
Well, I can't hear you, you

02:14.667 --> 02:15.900
Boop.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.000
Bo-boho.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.233
Real [bleep] funny,
you stupid [bleep].

02:20.233 --> 02:22.567
I'm gonna get your permit
pulled, you...

02:22.567 --> 02:24.133
Take it
You don't get that.

02:24.133 --> 02:25.300
Read the rule.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.433
You read 'em.
I was here first.

02:26.433 --> 02:27.767
You don't know
how to read.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.600
I was here [bleep] first.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.300
You are digging.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.667
Yes, we were.

02:32.667 --> 02:36.867
You [bleep] come
and mark our spot
and jump on us, you

02:36.867 --> 02:38.066
You're a [bleep] liar.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.967
You're gonna go down, Kris.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.967
Let's do this.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.000
idiot.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.433
They've come
and marked our spot
and jump on us.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.000
stupid.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.734
Shawn's just a hillbilly.

02:55.734 --> 02:57.934
He's trying to tell me
about regulations.

02:57.934 --> 03:00.300
You know, the guy just
goes way over there.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.266
Hey, what the
would he even know.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.634
Yeah, baby.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.066
Okay.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.767
Make that gold.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.700
We're gonna keep going.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.333
And no one's gonna stop us.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.600
so tired of that.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.900
Kris [bleep] telling.

03:37.333 --> 03:43.066
I see a lot of gold,
big chunky beads in
and a lot of flour.

03:43.066 --> 03:46.634
I don't know
how much gold we have,
but I know we got gold.

03:46.634 --> 03:48.233
I know we got gold.

03:48.233 --> 03:49.967
Come on, baby.
We got gold.

03:49.967 --> 03:51.066
We're in it.

03:55.433 --> 03:56.967
Yeah, they're out of their
element now.

03:56.967 --> 03:58.400
They need to back off.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.767
You're on my bouy.

04:00.767 --> 04:03.266
I'll [bleep] sink that
bitch in a heartbeat.

04:15.967 --> 04:18.567
We'll just keep digging
and [bleep] or what?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.634
I don't need this
right now.

04:28.166 --> 04:29.634
They think
this is their ocean.

04:29.634 --> 04:30.767
I don't think so.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.166
I'm here to stay.

04:39.367 --> 04:40.667
Go.

04:41.667 --> 04:42.900
Yeah.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.600
Just back out of there.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.834
Just don't...

04:47.834 --> 04:50.934
Let's not [bleep],
around here.

04:51.967 --> 04:53.834
So, I'll just...

04:59.767 --> 05:01.233
They're leaving now.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.333
Yeah!
Yeah!

05:04.600 --> 05:07.300
- He just tried to throw
his weight against us.
- Yeah.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.934
And we're the [bleep] wall
you cannot smash.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.967
You know,
Shawn's realized that his...

05:13.967 --> 05:17.634
his [bleep] all-star team
is [bleep] half the team
we got.

05:17.634 --> 05:22.233
The Kris team rose
and everybody associated
with it isn't afraid.

05:23.233 --> 05:25.133
They tucked tail and ran.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.367
That's what I like.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.166
Watch them [bleep] retreat.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.000
I put them back out there
on some sand.

05:39.066 --> 05:41.900
I made it.
Now no one's gonna stop me.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.433
Yeah.
Some [bleep] up.

05:52.934 --> 05:54.367
Just pisses me off.

05:55.634 --> 05:57.800
Bering Sea
is no place to be
messing around

05:57.800 --> 05:59.000
with heavy equipment.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.200
I ain't putting my crew
or my equipment at risk.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.033
I'm gonna work
on getting their
authorization pulled.

06:05.033 --> 06:08.333
But right now,
I need to concentrate
on making gold.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.934
I can't lose sight of that.

06:10.934 --> 06:13.634
Kris Kelly and his little
excavator toy,

06:14.834 --> 06:16.467
he'll be his own
worst enemy.

06:16.467 --> 06:17.533
Trust me.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.333
I don't [bleep] need this
right now.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.500
I don't.

06:25.500 --> 06:30.400
stress the
out and got enough
to worry about.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.700
And little Willie's weasly
ass and [bleep] Kris Kelly
and Kevin.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.200
Now, I might as well finish
this hole out

06:40.200 --> 06:42.300
and then we'll
step ahead.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.867
I'm not gonna
worry about these guys
right now.

06:52.800 --> 06:57.467
I want to punch
Kris Kelly in the face.

06:59.934 --> 07:02.533
And spray him
with a little bit of mace.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.100
So,
it's over for the day.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.767
I'm not saying
we won the battle

07:09.767 --> 07:12.567
because I'm sure
something will come
from this later on.

07:12.567 --> 07:16.533
But it's probably
the beginning
of a very long [bleep] year.

07:28.033 --> 07:30.900
As a new day
dawns on the Bering Sea,

07:30.900 --> 07:35.567
the battle moves
from within the fleet
to a fight with Mother Nature.

07:37.800 --> 07:42.100
In less than 24 hours,
the first major storm
of the summer

07:42.100 --> 07:43.834
will descend on Nome.

07:46.066 --> 07:51.133
Forcing the miners off
the water until it passes.

07:51.133 --> 07:57.567
So now it's imperative
to cash in while the window
of opportunity remains open.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.200
And in the harbor...

08:05.200 --> 08:07.100
So, we're ready
to go do some judging.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.166
Oh, yeah.

08:08.166 --> 08:09.233
I'm ready.

08:09.233 --> 08:10.600
All right.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.600
One captain
is looking to harvest
his kingdom

08:13.600 --> 08:15.200
while the getting's good.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.467
Okay,
I'm gonna power into it.

08:17.467 --> 08:20.000
Hold on to it.
Don't let it bite your hand.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.734
Claim 56 of the products
claim in Nome.

08:25.734 --> 08:28.734
And so far, this summer,
we've kept the winning
streak going

08:28.734 --> 08:30.367
that we started last season.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.900
Okay, let it go.

08:34.734 --> 08:39.533
I'm gunning for 300 ounces,
which quite honestly
ought to be easy peasy.

08:40.667 --> 08:41.834
You'll be first up.

08:41.834 --> 08:44.233
So, you check
all your dive gear, I mean...

08:44.233 --> 08:46.300
No, I was gonna go
do that right now.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.800
I want you to do it like,
right now.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.433
- Yeah.
- Before we get too far.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.767
I've taken a little punch.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.834
I don't have the same killer
team that I had last summer.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.700
I've got Bryan Wilder back.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.433
But I'm also gonna have
to rely on a crew member

09:01.433 --> 09:06.700
who's tended for me
a little bit in the past
but has never dove.

09:06.700 --> 09:10.000
My objective today
is same as every day

09:10.000 --> 09:12.433
to go out there
and get some gold.

09:12.433 --> 09:16.967
Bryan has the last dive,
so now it's Max's turn.

09:16.967 --> 09:18.834
So, we'll get him all
tagged out

09:18.834 --> 09:21.800
and put it in the water
here pretty damn quick.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.333
The weather is about
to be turned over
the next couple of days.

09:25.333 --> 09:29.500
And so, we're gonna
go out there a little bit
deeper on the claim.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.500
We're here.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.934
I'm gonna anchor up
and see how it hangs.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.734
Truth is,
I'm a little nervous
about this.

09:46.734 --> 09:49.266
I've got big plans
for this summer.

09:49.266 --> 09:52.834
Basically, I want to even
the playing field with Shawn.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.333
But in order for that
plan to work,

09:55.333 --> 09:59.333
I need a little Max
to get acclimated
to this job quick.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.000
The gold is there
for the taking.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.800
He just got to learn
how to snag it.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.367
Let's go ahead
and fire it up
and get him in the water.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.200
Okay, Max,
take your time going down.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.700
Take your time going down.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.934
Diver in the water.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.200
All right.
I'm at the bottom.

11:01.667 --> 11:02.967
All right.

11:02.967 --> 11:04.033
Yeah.
Hey, Max.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.367
That's the first time
you've been down.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.834
How you making out?

11:07.667 --> 11:08.900
I'm all right.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.400
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.900
Right now,
our main thing is,

11:16.900 --> 11:19.133
just be careful
and work back into it.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.500
Yeah.

11:31.467 --> 11:33.567
He's only
has been down
a couple of minutes.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.367
The material he's working.

11:35.367 --> 11:38.433
Does not appear to have
been worked before.

11:38.433 --> 11:42.934
We'll give him a chance
to make a cut and see
if he's seeing any gold.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.033
The only thing
I can hope is that

11:50.033 --> 11:53.600
we can make a withdrawal
from our royal gold bank

11:53.600 --> 11:55.600
at the bottom
of the Bering Sea.

12:11.967 --> 12:13.900
It's a new dawn.
It's a new day.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.700
Making [bleep] happen.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.133
As the storm
front looms on the distant horizon...

12:33.400 --> 12:36.667
Emily Riedel
is hoping for another
round in the ring

12:36.667 --> 12:40.100
before the Eroica's team
is forced off the water.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.266
Nice morning.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.400
I'm building a family
and I'm also building
a legacy.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.800
I'm aiming for 250 ounces
this summer,

12:52.800 --> 12:57.533
and I need it because
I depleted my nest
egg sitting out the winter.

12:57.533 --> 13:01.634
Luckily, Rick landed
on a great spot day one,
first time out in the water.

13:01.634 --> 13:03.667
So, we started off strong.

13:03.667 --> 13:06.834
So,
I want to hit it hard today
before that storm rolls in.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.900
Sounds good.

13:22.967 --> 13:25.266
Hey, how's it going?

13:25.266 --> 13:29.233
I'll tell you what,
for visibility,
this is perfect.

13:29.233 --> 13:31.433
I mean, you couldn't ask
for better, really?

13:31.433 --> 13:32.834
Whoo-oh.
I know.

13:32.834 --> 13:33.967
Yup.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.233
We're in.

13:42.266 --> 13:43.900
Oh, yeah, baby.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.767
This is...
Money right here.

13:45.767 --> 13:49.133
All that flower gold
is just amazing.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.300
And it's all over
this little gravel stuff.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.133
Heck yeah, buddy.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.333
I mean, I love it.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.667
Oh-oh.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.000
What's up?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.033
Ah...

14:24.834 --> 14:26.634
Yeah.
Let me check. One second.

14:37.767 --> 14:39.100
Oh, no.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.600
Rick's losing suction.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.533
Something's up
with the pump motor.

14:43.533 --> 14:47.367
Obviously, we can't mine
for gold if the pump motor
is not functioning correctly.

14:47.367 --> 14:50.166
If the pump motor's
not running, there's no way
to suck up gold.

14:50.166 --> 14:54.266
Um, I needed
an awesome day to day,
and it's not going well.

14:57.834 --> 15:02.100
Oh, it's
It's really

15:03.300 --> 15:05.900
We're losing RPMs
off the motor.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.367
Oh,

15:07.367 --> 15:08.433
Coming up?

15:08.433 --> 15:09.600
Yeah, I'm coming up.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.166
I mean, there's nothing
I can do down here.

15:11.166 --> 15:12.634
Yea, dude.
This sucks.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.934
It's always
when we're on good gold

15:25.934 --> 15:28.634
and the weather's perfect,
got to kind of get to work

15:28.634 --> 15:30.500
and figure out
what the hell's going on.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.200
Go for it.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.500
Yeah, we'll look
for what's going on
in the pump motor.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.100
I can't fix it out here.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.033
We're gonna pull the gear up
and bring the boat in.

15:42.033 --> 15:44.667
And this whole day
is just gone to hell.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.200
Hopefully
this just a super simple fix.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.066
But time is money.

15:49.066 --> 15:53.166
We're... we're losing it
right now the weather
could change like that.

15:53.166 --> 15:56.066
This is the time that
we have to make our money.

15:56.066 --> 15:57.934
We're losing
thousands of dollars.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.166
This is, like, insane.

16:05.066 --> 16:06.467
Back in Nome.

16:10.066 --> 16:12.367
Well, it's great
to be back in Nome.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.367
Oh, man. Oh.

16:16.367 --> 16:21.667
The fleet's most
notorious nomad touches down.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.567
We got the wheeler
somewhere in the parking lot.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.100
I forgot where it is.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.500
Huh?

16:27.500 --> 16:28.767
There it is.

16:29.634 --> 16:30.767
Forgot about the windshield.

16:30.767 --> 16:31.967
Look at that.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.800
It's been raining inside it.

16:35.934 --> 16:38.233
Oh, boy, pretty wet in there.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.367
This thing's been here
for three months.

16:44.367 --> 16:46.333
After the winter season,
I just left it.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.734
Oh, that's 90 days, huh?

16:48.734 --> 16:52.066
They give... they give you
a break 'cause they know
it's a tough place to live.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.834
Basically for me
at this point,

16:55.834 --> 16:57.800
it's just fighting
to survive up here.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.100
Not only can't I afford
a dredge,

17:00.100 --> 17:03.233
but I can't even afford
a windshield for my wheeler.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.767
You know,
hitting the ground here
in Nome,

17:04.767 --> 17:07.033
the first thing
you think about is,
you know, gold mining.

17:07.033 --> 17:09.300
But I... I can't be
gold mining without
a windshield in my...

17:09.300 --> 17:10.900
in my side by side.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.133
So, I'll find a windshield
and put it on.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.600
That's the first thing
I'm gonna do here in Nome.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.967
So, there you go.

17:24.367 --> 17:28.500
So, the question is,
what is the best way
for me to stay afloat.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.300
And I think I've come up
with a pretty good plan.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.767
I decided to mooch.

17:32.767 --> 17:36.767
I decided to look for owners
that are looking
for a little extra help.

17:36.767 --> 17:40.433
Help is scarce up here,
so I should be good.

17:40.433 --> 17:43.767
And I think I need
to scrounge up a windshield.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.233
That little rat Vernon
ripped me off
for the windshield.

17:56.233 --> 17:59.066
I know he's got my glass
windshield here.

17:59.066 --> 18:00.400
It should have come
with the wheeler,

18:00.400 --> 18:02.700
when I stopped the wheeler
I should have had it.

18:03.533 --> 18:05.233
I know the windshield's here.

18:06.634 --> 18:08.000
It's where?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.634
I made a fair
and square deal

18:09.634 --> 18:12.300
with Vernon for this
wheeler last summer.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.066
How about five and a half?

18:14.066 --> 18:15.266
How about eight?

18:15.266 --> 18:17.033
I'll give you six ounces
of gold for it.

18:17.033 --> 18:18.433
Thank you very much.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.634
Whoo-oh.

18:21.634 --> 18:25.500
But the big bugger,
Vern, he just forgot
to throw in a windshield.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.400
But I think if I just go up
to his scrap yard,

18:28.400 --> 18:30.300
I'll find something
he won't miss it.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.800
Might be in here.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.100
I'm not gonna go
into a lock on it,
but it looks not locked.

18:40.266 --> 18:41.600
Vernon.

18:49.367 --> 18:50.500
Nope.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.133
No, Vernon, No windshield.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.033
Look at this.

18:57.033 --> 18:58.634
Treasure trove plywood.

18:58.634 --> 19:00.367
Just sitting here rotting.

19:00.367 --> 19:02.800
That guy got too much money.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.834
There's some really cool
around here.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.634
I could use
some of this stuff.

19:09.634 --> 19:10.967
Oh.
Oh.

19:10.967 --> 19:12.367
Here's a box.

19:14.934 --> 19:16.967
Oh, there it is.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.333
The windshield.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.900
Cool.
I'm just gonna grab this.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.734
Oh, man.
Dry roads.

19:26.734 --> 19:29.667
When I'm dreaming
of dry rides.

19:29.667 --> 19:34.033
Dream about a dry rides,
no mud in the face
and the goggles.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.934
And just like that,
I'm ready for summer.

19:38.934 --> 19:41.967
I got to find a set of tools
and then put this thing on.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.133
I thought
it was gonna be
a great day today.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.333
I thought we were
gonna keep pressing forward.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.000
But my boat's down
and we're dead in the water.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.233
Miles away,
a storm may be gathering,

20:22.233 --> 20:27.200
but on this morning
a storm is already raging
upon our Reaper nation.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.467
We're coming up
to the boat I'm steering
a little bit here.

20:29.467 --> 20:31.133
We'll see what's going on.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.000
So, I started off
my day at the crack of dawn.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.033
James calls me right
off the bat and tells me

20:38.033 --> 20:39.834
the Mistress
is unable to mine.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.967
Like this is day two
and this crap is already
happening?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.967
Going to see
how bad it is.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.033
But it just
it's not working.

20:49.033 --> 20:51.467
It's gonna
be one of those days.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.667
The secret arrangement
that I have with Kevin is,

20:55.667 --> 20:58.667
he supplies
most of the money
in the beginning,

20:58.667 --> 21:00.367
but that's just
to get it started,

21:00.367 --> 21:02.700
to get the equipment we need.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.767
There are still payments
that need to be made,

21:04.767 --> 21:06.934
and we have a big
one coming up.

21:06.934 --> 21:09.734
I'm worried about
making my payment
at the end of the month

21:09.734 --> 21:12.433
if we have to bring
our boat in today.

21:12.433 --> 21:14.900
That's what
I'm worried about.

21:14.900 --> 21:19.400
We need 125,000
for the first installment
on most of this stuff.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.667
Thank you.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.467
Which is,
I don't know, a lot of money.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.767
Yeah.

21:33.767 --> 21:37.767
I was standing right here
and it just leaned over
and I was like...

21:37.767 --> 21:41.133
You guys are the one
that [bleep] welded
this sack [bleep].

21:43.300 --> 21:45.867
The spuds are crucial
to operating this barge.

21:45.867 --> 21:49.266
And right now,
one of the spud towers
are cracking and twisting.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.500
The welds aren't holding up.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.867
And this tower
has already been an issue
with Kevin and I.

21:55.867 --> 21:59.367
This actually was a lot
more expensive than
I thought it was gonna be.

21:59.367 --> 22:00.800
Well, how much?

22:00.800 --> 22:02.033
$40,000.

22:02.033 --> 22:04.667
- I spent 40,000 on just this.
- No, we didn't.

22:04.667 --> 22:05.800
Yeah, we did.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.133
40,000?

22:08.133 --> 22:09.767
The Mistress
doesn't have anchors.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.467
That's what the spuds
are for.

22:11.467 --> 22:13.500
So, if the spuds aren't
working properly,

22:13.500 --> 22:16.033
we can't keep the boat
on one spot.

22:16.033 --> 22:19.200
In reality, we can't mine
if it's not fixed.

22:21.567 --> 22:25.533
This was a $40,000 disaster
that you came up with.

22:28.734 --> 22:30.000
This isn't so.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.467
So, the game plan
was to waste $40,000
is that our game plan?

22:38.467 --> 22:40.900
My thought
is [bleep] piece of

22:40.900 --> 22:44.533
my thought is
we're gonna reinforce
it like a [bleep].

22:44.533 --> 22:46.133
Put that half inch on top.

22:46.133 --> 22:48.834
Put that other pulley
in and we're going back out.

22:49.467 --> 22:51.033
That's my [bleep] thought.

22:51.033 --> 22:52.300
I like that,
let's do it.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.800
I don't mean to get angry,
but I'm so
so stressed.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.066
You have no idea.

22:57.567 --> 22:59.333
And I don't mean
to be stressed.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.333
Fire up the thrust master, please.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.166
We're gonna make this work.

23:06.166 --> 23:08.033
You know,
we'll make this work fast.

23:09.934 --> 23:12.033
We're going
to the dock to reweld
the towers

23:12.033 --> 23:13.700
so it's not so screwed up.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.066
Hopefully the bad
weather coming.

23:15.066 --> 23:16.467
We got to do it fast.

23:16.467 --> 23:17.567
We're up against it.

23:17.567 --> 23:18.934
We're on the ropes here.

23:18.934 --> 23:20.300
Okay.

23:20.300 --> 23:23.867
We're about to go back
into the harbor
so we can fabricate this.

23:23.867 --> 23:26.867
I'm sure it's not gonna
be done 100% correctly,

23:26.867 --> 23:30.767
but I guarantee my fixes
will last for the rest
of the season.

23:32.166 --> 23:34.133
Turn into a nightmare.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.634
Bad juju.

23:38.033 --> 23:42.200
While
the Mistress heads in,
back out on the Tomcod.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.467
Oh, no,
the Mistress is broken.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.600
Kris Kelly,
he wants to beat me so bad.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.400
But the fact of the matter is,
he hasn't worked hard
enough in his life

24:03.400 --> 24:04.767
to get to where I'm at.

24:04.767 --> 24:06.634
I mean, you got to do right,

24:06.634 --> 24:08.867
you can't come jump
on people claims,

24:08.867 --> 24:13.000
he wants to do
illegal and be a anything.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.767
, man,
he can be a piece of

24:14.767 --> 24:17.500
but he ain't gonna do
it but [bleep] me over.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.266
Doing this job is not easy.

24:21.266 --> 24:23.200
I've been at this
for decades.

24:23.200 --> 24:28.000
I've been learning, studying,
figuring out
how every ounce of gold

24:28.000 --> 24:30.667
is gonna be earned and spent.

24:30.667 --> 24:34.166
You can't just walk in here
and think you're gonna be
a gold mogul overnight.

24:34.166 --> 24:35.533
Not a chance.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.634
Weather's good for now,
but we've got weather
coming in,

24:44.634 --> 24:48.266
so we got to put
some gold in the box.

24:48.266 --> 24:50.000
Make some money.

24:51.433 --> 24:54.200
We got all three
lots ran from it.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.934
Myrtle Irene, Christine Rose.

24:57.934 --> 25:01.867
And the Inland are firing
on all cylinders today.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.367
We're having a party.

25:03.367 --> 25:06.700
The only one that
wasn't really invited
was Kris.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.400
If brains
were dynamite,

25:10.400 --> 25:13.700
Kris Kelly wouldn't have
enough power to blow his nose.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.133
Oh.

25:25.934 --> 25:28.600
What up?

25:28.600 --> 25:31.834
He's doing and doing...

25:38.033 --> 25:39.467
What happened?

25:44.367 --> 25:46.834
Bad problem
at even a worse time.

25:46.834 --> 25:49.000
Belt on the shaker
plant snapped.

25:52.033 --> 25:54.967
The shaker
is vital to the offshore
mining operation.

25:54.967 --> 25:59.667
It separates
all the oversize rock
from the ocean sediments

25:59.667 --> 26:01.200
that we process.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.900
Without it, we're screwed.

26:03.934 --> 26:05.033
Quick, change it.

26:05.033 --> 26:06.533
It'll go on easy.

26:08.066 --> 26:11.500
Until we get a new belt
on the shaker, we're down.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.333
Luckily, putting on a new belt
isn't a major deal,

26:14.333 --> 26:15.867
and we have them on the boat.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.333
Got a new belt on there.

26:38.367 --> 26:40.066
go.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.800
Popped it off.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.233
Should be more on board.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.634
There's another one there.

26:55.066 --> 26:56.467
Clear.

27:18.867 --> 27:21.266
Now
with that first one.

27:21.266 --> 27:22.400
Clear.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.166
He is [bleep].

27:34.900 --> 27:36.300
One more new one?

27:36.834 --> 27:38.667
One more new one.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.300
The tension
isn't tight enough,

27:40.300 --> 27:43.066
so the belts keep sliding off, snapping.

27:43.066 --> 27:45.734
This is a delicate
art to get this right.

27:45.734 --> 27:47.667
And this is our last belt.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.567
If we don't get it right,
we're done.

27:50.433 --> 27:52.233
They have to fire back up.

27:52.233 --> 27:53.634
Barge.

27:55.734 --> 27:57.166
It's not holding.

27:57.166 --> 27:58.700
No, stop!

28:02.200 --> 28:04.066
It wasn't meant to be.

28:04.066 --> 28:06.200
You just got to loosen
these four bolts,

28:06.200 --> 28:11.200
slide the motor fore back,
put a little more tension
on the...

28:11.200 --> 28:12.500
everything.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.800
We're gonna make
an adjustment.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.600
Hopefully
this does the trick.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.500
We got one more day
to mine before
the storm comes in,

28:20.500 --> 28:22.567
kicks us off the water
for a while.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.467
I got to keep
this baby going.

28:24.467 --> 28:27.266
It takes a lot of gold
to pay for this operation.

28:27.266 --> 28:29.700
And if I don't get production
from the Myrtle today,

28:29.700 --> 28:31.800
we're gonna be
in a seriously bad place.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.800
Bering Sea gold gods,
please be on my side.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.533
Giving it some [bleep].

28:44.533 --> 28:47.333
Gold mining Juju.

28:47.867 --> 28:48.967
Go, boy.

28:48.967 --> 28:50.467
Clear!

29:08.667 --> 29:10.233
Hell yeah.

29:14.767 --> 29:17.500
Time to make some money
instead of spending.

29:22.333 --> 29:25.066
Man, this material
looks really good.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.367
And we can keep
everything up and running.

29:30.367 --> 29:33.934
We'll have that gold room
burning and turning.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.934
We're gonna get as many
hours on the box as we can.

29:39.934 --> 29:42.233
You've got to make
hey while the sun shines.

29:50.433 --> 29:53.266
Yeah. Hey, Max,
how you making out?

29:54.900 --> 29:56.000
We've been...

30:04.233 --> 30:06.900
Looking to turn
his operation
into one of Nome's

30:06.900 --> 30:11.367
golden kingdoms,
Vernon Adkison is hoping
his rookie diver

30:11.367 --> 30:14.066
learns on the job, quick.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.200
He's not seeing it.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.266
There's great silt
down there,

30:22.333 --> 30:25.567
which would make
it hard to see gold.

30:25.567 --> 30:28.967
Yeah, Yeah.
Max, you're not
seeing it right now.

30:28.967 --> 30:33.266
Just go ahead
and start moving around
and do some prospecting.

30:37.767 --> 30:39.000
All right.

31:12.166 --> 31:13.300
Dammit.

31:16.367 --> 31:20.133
Rough currents and deeper
water can easily
rattle a diver,

31:20.133 --> 31:23.834
particularly an inexperienced
one like Max.

31:23.834 --> 31:26.000
It's not unusual
to get headaches

31:26.000 --> 31:29.867
or even the bends
in that situation
if you're not up to par.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.467
Hey, Max,
you've got 3 hours, man.

31:36.467 --> 31:38.200
Try and suit it up.

31:38.867 --> 31:40.567
Why don't you come on up?

31:47.467 --> 31:50.200
Needless to say,
I'm disappointed.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.367
But I've just got to get
Bryan in there

31:52.367 --> 31:54.834
and start getting
some friggin' gold.

31:54.834 --> 31:56.767
All right.
Come up nice and slow.

32:05.233 --> 32:07.900
Max had
to come up,
we got a couple of hours in.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.266
He had a headache.

32:09.266 --> 32:12.200
It didn't sound like
he was onto
really anything hot.

32:12.200 --> 32:16.667
And so, let me go up here
and take a look
at the damn GPS.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.634
I think
we're out of it.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.767
But we've got to reposition.

32:34.767 --> 32:37.900
That's part of mining,
you've got to reposition
every now and then.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.867
You don't just drop
the anchor and stay
there all day.

32:40.867 --> 32:44.266
So, we're not all good gold,
we'll go look
for another spot.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.000
Dammit.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.266
I got a headache, too.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.033
Anchor's off.

32:53.033 --> 32:54.967
Okay.

32:54.967 --> 32:56.934
This day is starting
to piss me off.

32:56.934 --> 32:59.667
The new kid didn't get
on anything special.

32:59.667 --> 33:03.533
And now the current
is starting to blow us off
our hotspot.

33:03.533 --> 33:07.867
We've got to try
to reposition and get back
on the good stuff.

33:07.867 --> 33:11.967
Plus, these winds
are telling me that
there's a storm not far off.

33:11.967 --> 33:13.834
I need every day to count.

33:13.834 --> 33:17.000
And so far, this day
has not counted for squat.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.700
Okay.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.233
Fire it up again.

33:27.066 --> 33:29.266
Bryan's gonna go down.

33:29.266 --> 33:31.300
Let the man
take a look around,

33:31.300 --> 33:34.967
pop some holes
spend an hour or two.

33:34.967 --> 33:38.500
But I would like to get
a little gold in the box,
if you know what I mean.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.433
Slowly, Bryan.

33:52.433 --> 33:53.634
Slowly.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.900
Yeah.
I just got to go down slow.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.300
Try to be equal out.

33:59.367 --> 34:00.834
Bryan...

34:00.834 --> 34:04.700
he got a habit of bleeding
because he won't properly
clear his ears.

34:04.700 --> 34:09.634
I've seen him with blood
coming out of his eyes
and his ears.

34:11.333 --> 34:14.033
Over a yard, equalize
and get comfortable.

34:14.033 --> 34:15.400
All right.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.300
I won't mess
with him right now,

34:17.300 --> 34:19.767
but just give
it a couple of minutes,

34:19.767 --> 34:22.634
we got some good weather here.

34:22.634 --> 34:25.467
And we got to take
advantage of this opportunity.

34:26.367 --> 34:28.800
I want to think of gold
in a box.

34:34.266 --> 34:36.433
Back at the harbor...

34:36.433 --> 34:38.166
Time to get
out on the water.

34:38.767 --> 34:40.100
Coughing.

34:41.266 --> 34:42.867
Dude I got my summer working.

34:42.867 --> 34:44.967
Got the boat all gassed up,
ready to go.

34:44.967 --> 34:49.500
We'll go out and was thinking
about something else.

34:49.500 --> 34:54.867
Um, I'm gonna go out
and I'm going to...

34:57.800 --> 35:00.066
Yeah.

35:00.066 --> 35:03.500
Well, yeah,
I'm gonna go out
and my plan is to go

35:03.500 --> 35:06.500
and map out a bunch
of underwater features.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.634
Try to find some islands
to cobble out of the sand
and hold them.

35:09.634 --> 35:11.166
And that's my plan.

35:11.166 --> 35:15.033
This summer,
mad scientist Zeke Tenhoff
has tied his hopes

35:15.033 --> 35:19.266
and dreams to Mr. Gold
and the Tomcod claim.

35:19.266 --> 35:20.367
Well, yeah,
We're ready.

35:20.367 --> 35:23.166
We're ready to roll.
Let's go.

35:23.166 --> 35:25.767
My brother and I have
a good deal going
with Shawn.

35:25.767 --> 35:28.000
He's letting us mine out
on Tomcod,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.567
and we're leasing
the Havilah from him

35:30.567 --> 35:32.433
and giving him
a percentage of that gold.

35:32.433 --> 35:34.300
Let's get out there
and get after it.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.233
- Let's make some money.
- Yeah.

35:36.233 --> 35:39.800
I'm gonna use
my rig to map out
this untouched ground

35:39.800 --> 35:42.767
in deeper water,
and I'll pass the info
on to Gabe

35:42.767 --> 35:45.000
who's getting the Havilah
ready for mining.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.266
The problem is,
I thought that
I could prospect on my own

35:48.266 --> 35:49.567
with this little dredge
that I made,

35:49.567 --> 35:52.266
but it's just like
proving too hard for me.

35:52.266 --> 35:53.967
And I'm getting wiped out
and I need help.

35:53.967 --> 35:55.867
So, I'm bringing
in an extra hand.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.500
Oh-oh.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.033
I'm a little late,
but I'm ready for the day.

36:14.033 --> 36:16.133
I even brought paper towels.

36:16.934 --> 36:18.200
Good morning, Zeke.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.433
Good morning.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Okay.
Go ahead, Zeke.

36:26.133 --> 36:28.533
First voyage
of the season for me.

36:28.533 --> 36:32.367
I'm not entirely
sure how much Steve
helped us last winter.

36:35.467 --> 36:37.200
Pizza delivery.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.033
But Steve wasn't
a hindrance for me,
so that's good.

36:40.033 --> 36:41.400
So, if you can just
keep that up,

36:41.400 --> 36:43.333
I think it'll be great
having him out there.

36:49.567 --> 36:50.934
All right.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.500
I'm gonna start logging
some sonar charts here.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.166
Good, I'm gonna like
just anchor up right here.

37:13.166 --> 37:15.634
Yeah.
Looks like a good spot.

37:19.934 --> 37:21.066
All right.

37:21.066 --> 37:22.433
Good to go.

37:31.734 --> 37:33.533
Oops.

37:33.533 --> 37:36.533
Oh, I filled up
the wrong fuel tanks.

37:39.567 --> 37:42.300
Trying to accelerate,
really add pressure
to that tank,

37:42.300 --> 37:43.867
so it drains out more.

37:43.867 --> 37:45.433
But I don't think
it's worthwhile.

37:45.433 --> 37:49.767
I think you've got too
much gas in your brain
when you do that and it's bad.

37:49.767 --> 37:53.433
I mean, the thing about
getting high on gas
is you have to just like,

37:54.133 --> 37:56.266
fight through it, you know.

37:56.266 --> 37:57.767
I feel great.

37:57.767 --> 37:59.367
Ooh.

37:59.367 --> 38:00.734
Exxon.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.867
Yeah.
There we go.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.200
Damn.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.667
Will do.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.300
You're good to go.

39:11.033 --> 39:12.367
Roger that.

39:16.300 --> 39:18.767
Focus on the gold,
not the noise.

39:22.467 --> 39:25.233
And now
it's time for another
edition of,

39:27.033 --> 39:29.200
Do you know your miner?

39:30.700 --> 39:33.934
Steve Riedel has worked
with plenty of teams
over the years.

39:33.934 --> 39:36.200
Cold means gold.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.533
So, take that cold
and turn it into gold.

39:38.533 --> 39:40.433
But have you
ever asked yourself

39:40.433 --> 39:44.467
what purpose does
he actually serve
aboard a crew?

39:44.467 --> 39:46.200
We do have coffee, don't we?

39:48.100 --> 39:53.667
Does Steve,
A, prepare the team
for rough seas ahead?

39:53.667 --> 39:56.033
Ooh.
Got some good
swells coming in.

39:56.033 --> 39:57.433
Oh.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.266
You okay, buddy?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.700
No.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.533
B, serve up
high end cuisine.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.300
Right in there.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.033
It's heating up fast.

40:12.033 --> 40:13.533
Oh, look at it. Go.

40:13.533 --> 40:15.433
No one on the earth
like Steve Riedel.

40:16.667 --> 40:18.033
Whoo!

40:18.033 --> 40:21.233
Or C,
always be at the ready.

40:21.233 --> 40:22.500
What the
you doing?

40:22.500 --> 40:24.166
Steve, come on.
Damn it.

40:24.166 --> 40:25.400
What?

40:27.600 --> 40:29.300
And the correct
answer is...

40:29.300 --> 40:31.600
honestly, we have no idea
what Steve does.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.400
But whatever it is,
nobody does it better.

40:34.400 --> 40:38.734
And so ends another
edition of "Do you know
your miner?"

40:39.667 --> 40:40.934
Much better.

40:43.734 --> 40:48.834
In Nome,
the first major storm
of summer

40:48.834 --> 40:51.133
is set to strike by nightfall.

40:53.133 --> 40:57.033
So, for the fleet,
the fight is on to gather
the gold

40:58.433 --> 41:01.700
before Mother Nature
knocks them out.

41:05.033 --> 41:06.734
And out on the Bering Sea...

41:13.400 --> 41:15.867
Box is running
really nice,

41:15.867 --> 41:17.934
seeing some color in there.

41:17.934 --> 41:22.000
Mr. Gold currently
has the Tomcod all to himself.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.166
It doesn't look like
the Kellys are out here.

41:25.166 --> 41:27.066
Oh, too bad.

41:28.367 --> 41:31.000
Got every tentacle
of my operation running.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.967
While Kris is sitting
at the dock,

41:32.967 --> 41:35.934
that's what happens
when you bite off more
than you can chew.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.634
And believe me,
that's what that joker
is doing.

41:40.634 --> 41:42.433
Running a little rinky
dink dredge.

41:42.433 --> 41:46.266
Doesn't set you up
for the reality of running
an excavator barge.

41:46.266 --> 41:48.567
That boy is in way
over his head.

41:50.367 --> 41:54.233
That they're evaluating
their [bleep] decisions
right now.

41:57.834 --> 41:59.266
Back at the dock...

42:03.900 --> 42:04.967
Here we sit.

42:04.967 --> 42:07.200
Everybody else
is making money but us.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.467
I just need
this [bleep] thing to pay me.

42:13.467 --> 42:16.767
I'm getting you all kinds
of things that treat
you good,

42:16.767 --> 42:19.600
you [bleep] sack of

42:19.600 --> 42:22.934
Like everything's gonna
work out really good, dude.

42:22.934 --> 42:27.767
Kris Kelly
is in the midst of a stressful
and costly pit stop.

42:27.767 --> 42:29.900
This has been
a [bleep] disaster.

42:31.233 --> 42:34.000
We're stuck fixing
the stupid rigging
on the spud tower.

42:35.433 --> 42:38.166
Bad weather is gonna kick
our ass in less than 24 hours.

42:38.166 --> 42:42.867
And if that's not enough,
17 days to come up
with $125,000,

42:42.867 --> 42:45.133
that's a [bleep] feat.

42:45.133 --> 42:48.233
I got to come up
with a massive payment
at the end of the month

42:48.233 --> 42:51.266
or basically the Mistress
can be repossessed.

42:51.266 --> 42:54.634
So, you could say
there's a storm
on the horizon.

42:54.634 --> 42:56.900
It's called my life
right now.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.467
But it is what
it is at this point,

42:58.467 --> 43:01.166
we need to make good
on our agreement.

43:01.166 --> 43:03.333
And I'm trying.
I'm really trying.

43:03.333 --> 43:06.166
You know, everybody
in town is probably
laughing at me.

43:11.266 --> 43:14.600
You know, it's...
it's my first year right now
with this excavator barge.

43:14.600 --> 43:16.700
A lot of people around me
sees me coming up

43:16.700 --> 43:18.634
very fast in the mining community,

43:18.634 --> 43:21.600
and some people
are a little threatened
by that.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.767
They want to make sure
I don't get all the way.

43:24.734 --> 43:26.266
I'm not gonna be laughed at.

43:26.266 --> 43:28.133
You know, we're gonna
turn this around.

43:29.367 --> 43:30.767
I like it.

43:31.867 --> 43:33.533
Yeah, baby.

43:35.467 --> 43:36.934
He's got the cap
on the lattice.

43:36.934 --> 43:38.500
We're about ready
to go mining.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.533
I'm so happy to be
done with this.

43:40.533 --> 43:42.800
What it should have been
done in the first place.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.533
But if this thing fails,
this whole boat's gonna
be in the water.

43:48.066 --> 43:50.767
I'm a little worried.

43:50.767 --> 43:54.700
The tower is kind of fixed,
but we don't have a lot
of time right now.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.700
The storm is closing
in on us.

43:56.700 --> 43:58.367
So, it's like the tower
went in the corner.

43:58.367 --> 43:59.533
It got patched up.

43:59.533 --> 44:02.634
Now it's back in the ring,
ready to take a beating.

44:02.634 --> 44:05.867
It's iffy, but I just keep
thinking about the payment
coming due.

44:05.867 --> 44:07.033
What do you think?

44:07.033 --> 44:08.300
Should we take the risk?

44:08.300 --> 44:10.066
My gut feeling says no.

44:10.066 --> 44:13.600
But like, my desperation
says, [bleep] yeah.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.000
If we don't take the chance,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.533
we might be losing the boat
at the end of the month.

44:18.734 --> 44:20.400
We can't.
This is the only way
we can do it.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.700
You know we can't be safe.

44:21.700 --> 44:22.800
- Yup.
- Okay.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.500
Well, that's what
we're gonna have
to take the risk.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.600
We'll... we'll take that
risk and make it happen.

44:26.600 --> 44:27.900
All systems are go.

44:27.900 --> 44:29.500
We got green across
the board.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.467
Time to get out there
and make some gold.

44:31.467 --> 44:33.266
Get the [bleep] out of here.

44:35.367 --> 44:36.767
Tell them, Kevin.

44:40.834 --> 44:42.233
Two miles east...

44:47.233 --> 44:48.667
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

44:48.667 --> 44:50.800
Yeah.

44:50.800 --> 44:53.400
All right. Well, let's prime this
and see what happens.

44:53.400 --> 44:57.066
With the clock
at ticking before a storm
knocks them to the sidelines.

44:57.066 --> 45:01.200
Emily Riedel is trying
to get her pump engine
a-pumping

45:01.200 --> 45:04.667
and the gold flowing ASAP.

45:04.667 --> 45:06.367
I think
it's the fuel issue.

45:06.367 --> 45:08.667
So we replace
with fuel filters.

45:08.667 --> 45:10.400
Hopefully it's back.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.166
We could make some
money today.

45:13.300 --> 45:15.533
I'm going for 250 ounces
this... this summer.

45:15.533 --> 45:17.734
So, we've got to get
to mining right away.

45:17.734 --> 45:22.000
I'm hoping that all
the pump motor needs
is a fuel purge

45:22.000 --> 45:23.700
and the change of filter.

45:23.700 --> 45:25.900
If that's it, then
we'll get back on the gold

45:25.900 --> 45:28.100
and we'll kill it the rest
of the day.

45:28.100 --> 45:31.033
If there's a deeper issue
with the diesel motor
than a fuel problem.

45:31.033 --> 45:32.800
Then we're completely
screwed for it today.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.033
Ready?

45:34.033 --> 45:35.233
Yeah.
Hit it.

45:44.533 --> 45:46.133
Whoo-hoo!

45:47.634 --> 45:48.900
So far, it's running.

45:48.900 --> 45:50.867
So, get back
out there.

45:50.867 --> 45:53.200
That's running fine
may as well.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.800
- All righty.
- All right.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.066
- Hi-five.
- Hi-five.

45:57.133 --> 45:58.500
Maybe this is my year.

45:58.500 --> 46:02.800
Yesterday we crushed it,
and today we dodged
a massive bullet.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.800
Yeah, we can get
Rick back onto the water,

46:04.800 --> 46:07.767
get some gold in the box
and keep the train moving.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.066
Come see
it's all good.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.000
How is your suction?

46:39.567 --> 46:41.367
Yeah, dude.
That's awesome.

46:45.967 --> 46:47.100
Whoo!

46:47.100 --> 46:49.467
Are you in some
chunky stuff, Rick?

46:49.467 --> 46:50.600
Like that...

46:50.600 --> 46:52.367
nugget you found
the other day?

47:00.567 --> 47:02.000
Sounds good, brother.

47:04.800 --> 47:07.367
With this stuff,
we cross our fingers.

47:11.266 --> 47:13.200
We got some
weather coming in, so.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.400
Gosh. I hope we make
some money today.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.767
12 miles west...

47:29.734 --> 47:33.767
So, Zeke,
for our audience around
the world,

47:33.767 --> 47:38.634
millions looking on daily
basis for gold.

47:38.634 --> 47:41.200
Are you finding any?

47:41.200 --> 47:43.567
Yeah. It seems
like the cod is holding.

47:43.567 --> 47:46.634
It's pretty consistent along
this whole line that
I'm working.

47:57.166 --> 47:59.300
Roger that.

47:59.300 --> 48:04.600
A new dynamic
duo may be forming
on the mighty Tomcod claim.

48:16.367 --> 48:17.634
Hey, Steve.

48:17.634 --> 48:18.967
Yo, Zeke.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.133
You...
you found a nugget?

48:25.133 --> 48:26.834
Yeah.

48:31.567 --> 48:33.967
Yeah, um, I...
I like a...

48:33.967 --> 48:36.400
I like a nugget that
looks like Africa.

48:38.834 --> 48:40.800
Nice.
I'll take it.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.934
Oh,
that's nice.

48:53.934 --> 48:55.500
That's huge.

48:56.300 --> 48:57.600
Yeah!

48:57.600 --> 49:00.800
That's my kind of gold there,
big old hunks of it.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.166
Looks like Africa.

49:02.166 --> 49:03.467
See you like that there.

49:03.467 --> 49:05.600
Just like Africa.
Just like it.

49:07.233 --> 49:08.834
Man,
that is a nice nugget.

49:08.834 --> 49:10.133
It is a nice one, man.

49:10.133 --> 49:11.333
It's huge.

49:11.333 --> 49:12.967
Like, I don't know
how much you think
is gonna weigh,

49:12.967 --> 49:14.367
quarter an ounce?

49:14.367 --> 49:16.600
I was guessing
about a quarter.

49:16.600 --> 49:17.834
Maybe about quarter.

49:17.834 --> 49:19.533
Actually it's quarter,
to a third maybe.

49:19.967 --> 49:22.166
Cool.

49:22.166 --> 49:25.900
If I'm in a place
where there's nugs like this.

49:25.900 --> 49:28.934
There isn't really
any question that
I stay in this place,

49:28.934 --> 49:31.266
because there'll probably
be more nugs like this.

49:31.266 --> 49:33.400
And if you hit a couple
of these today,

49:33.400 --> 49:36.533
it really bumps up
your average, big time.

49:36.533 --> 49:38.133
Cool.
It's a nice one.

49:38.133 --> 49:39.533
It's a fat nug.

49:42.634 --> 49:45.600
This nug is the dankest nug
I have ever found.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.133
And this spot is awesome.

49:47.133 --> 49:49.033
I can't wait till
we can get the Havilah
out here.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.600
There could be dank nugs
like this hiding all around
this whole area.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.400
I'm gonna smash down
one of these sandwiches

49:56.400 --> 49:58.800
I have and get back down
there as soon as possible.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.133
There's a bunch of gold
around here.

50:01.133 --> 50:02.367
It's great.

50:05.800 --> 50:08.166
It's a good spot here.

50:08.166 --> 50:10.066
It's the right call
at this point to get it tender

50:10.066 --> 50:12.500
so I don't have to worry
about any of the stuff up top.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.300
And I can focus on staying
on the bottom

50:14.300 --> 50:16.000
and getting as much
gold as I can.

50:22.867 --> 50:24.700
You ready?

50:24.700 --> 50:28.000
Okay, I'll fire it up.
I'll get... full volume
on the pump.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.266
We need a couple
more nuggets, man.

50:36.266 --> 50:41.033
You know,
maybe North America or,
you know, Eurasia.

50:41.033 --> 50:43.266
You can find
a Eurasia one.

50:43.266 --> 50:44.767
That would be hot.

50:44.767 --> 50:46.367
Okay.
Steve.

50:46.367 --> 50:47.500
Awesome.

50:58.867 --> 51:02.500
Another day,
another dollar
on the Bering Sea.

51:02.500 --> 51:05.133
With the patchwork
holding on the spud tower,

51:05.133 --> 51:09.133
the Mistress looks
to get in a few licks
before the oncoming storm.

51:14.634 --> 51:16.934
We're out here
on last stages warning,

51:16.934 --> 51:18.700
we got a big storm coming in.

51:18.700 --> 51:21.133
It's up to us today
to stay on the gold

51:21.133 --> 51:23.367
and try to get as much
as we can.

51:24.367 --> 51:26.734
Reaper Nation cannot
be denied.

51:26.734 --> 51:28.367
The spud tower
turns into junk.

51:28.367 --> 51:29.767
No problem.
We fix it.

51:29.767 --> 51:31.133
We're back out here mining,

51:31.133 --> 51:33.934
which is really important
because we need a lot
of gold to make

51:33.934 --> 51:35.033
our first payment.

51:35.033 --> 51:36.734
And I know
we're gonna be down
for a bit

51:36.734 --> 51:38.600
once this storm hits.

51:38.600 --> 51:41.266
So, all that matters
is nothing else goes
wrong today,

51:41.266 --> 51:42.600
and we'll be fine.

51:53.367 --> 51:54.900
You hear that?

51:56.300 --> 51:57.867
Oh,

52:01.433 --> 52:03.467
Oh, what the
is going on now?

52:11.800 --> 52:13.266
Well, that's not good.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.200
Okay.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.700
All right.

52:42.867 --> 52:44.000
Cool.

52:47.734 --> 52:49.834
We don't have
a bunch of replacements
for that?

52:53.533 --> 52:56.834
So that stupid pin
that keeps the bucket
from not falling off, fell off

52:56.834 --> 52:59.800
and these idiots
don't have a spare.

52:59.800 --> 53:03.567
So, we're gonna weld
some random piece in there
and hope it works.

53:08.066 --> 53:09.400
Just kill me now.

53:10.834 --> 53:13.100
Ghetto fabulous fix.

53:13.100 --> 53:14.900
That's how
it's done on the ocean.

53:26.266 --> 53:27.533
We're good.

53:29.367 --> 53:30.834
Should work.

53:30.834 --> 53:36.100
Hopefully, if not,
the bucket is gonna fall off
and it's gonna be epic.

53:41.700 --> 53:45.266
Did you guys hear that
Hope that we don't
lose the bucket.

53:50.133 --> 53:52.166
That bucket costs $10,000.

53:52.166 --> 53:55.233
That bucket is what brings
gold from the bottom
of the sea.

53:55.233 --> 53:57.734
Without that bucket,
you idiot, there's no gold.

53:57.734 --> 53:59.166
There's no Reaper Nation.

54:00.433 --> 54:02.433
Maybe to that guy,
it's not a big deal.

54:02.433 --> 54:05.266
But when you're an owner,
let me tell you, it sure is.

54:11.900 --> 54:14.600
Obviously that [bleep] guy
doesn't understand
the importance

54:14.600 --> 54:16.300
of that bucket or something.

54:33.100 --> 54:34.667
Yeah, baby.

54:35.333 --> 54:36.800
We're back up and running.

54:36.800 --> 54:38.867
Hopefully back on gold.

54:38.867 --> 54:40.533
'Cause we need that gold.

54:44.934 --> 54:46.400
Make that gold.

54:48.734 --> 54:50.367
12 miles east...

54:53.667 --> 54:54.834
Hey, Ricardo.

54:54.834 --> 54:56.333
How does the bottom look?

54:57.400 --> 54:58.834
Oh, it's looking fantastic.

54:58.834 --> 54:59.967
Em.

55:00.867 --> 55:01.934
Whoo-ho!

55:06.834 --> 55:09.500
Yeah. Today we'll have
a nice cleanup for sure.

55:10.567 --> 55:12.967
After an earlier
engine snafu,

55:12.967 --> 55:16.467
things are really starting
to suck for Emily Riedel.

55:16.467 --> 55:18.133
In the very best of ways.

55:18.133 --> 55:21.300
It seems like
the suction is good.

55:21.300 --> 55:23.033
I'll keep an eye on it,
we got a...

55:23.033 --> 55:25.500
It seems to be back to normal.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.166
This spot has some hot gold.

55:27.166 --> 55:29.600
This is a perfect way
to start the season.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.000
And we've got a storm
rolling in.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.634
It's gonna shut us down
for a couple of days.

55:32.634 --> 55:36.166
It's a gnarly one,
but Rick's gonna more than
make up for that today.

55:36.166 --> 55:39.700
This is the level I need
my operation to be
running at all the time.

55:39.700 --> 55:42.700
I want to build
this operation into an empire,

55:42.700 --> 55:45.233
and I want to do it
for the future of my family.

55:45.233 --> 55:47.066
And I am the Empress.

55:47.066 --> 55:48.367
I am the Queen.

55:52.367 --> 55:53.800
I'm gonna swap out with Alex.

55:53.800 --> 55:57.800
He's like a total role changer
to have another captain
in the boat.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.600
Now it's like one of you
against the world now.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.634
Now it's two of you
against the world.

56:01.634 --> 56:03.166
So, hopefully
we made a lot of ounces.

56:04.700 --> 56:07.200
Hello.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.000
Now that we're back on gold,
I'm gonna have my better
half take over.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.834
And I'm gonna go get
the gold room set up.

56:11.834 --> 56:13.000
Yo baby?

56:13.000 --> 56:14.200
How are you?

56:14.200 --> 56:15.300
Okay.

56:16.433 --> 56:18.834
Yeah. Then we're gonna get
a lot of dive time in today.

56:18.834 --> 56:21.767
I'm gonna have like
really solid hours for a...

56:21.767 --> 56:22.900
for a tune up.

56:22.900 --> 56:24.000
Yeah.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.600
In order to ensure
our growing empire,

56:26.600 --> 56:30.400
um, my husband Alex
is gonna be out here
learning the ropes

56:30.400 --> 56:32.233
of the Eroica,
learning how to run it,

56:32.233 --> 56:36.066
learning the ins and outs,
and he's gonna be taking
the reins from time to time.

56:36.066 --> 56:37.533
All right, love you, bunches.

56:37.533 --> 56:39.000
Love you too.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.767
I had asked my husband,
Alex to come out
and take over for me.

56:53.767 --> 56:56.900
It's really great thing there,
I highly recommend it.

56:56.900 --> 56:59.700
I did this alone for a long
time and it was hard.

56:59.700 --> 57:01.300
It's really, really hard.

57:01.300 --> 57:06.333
It's just nice, you know,
at least in the hope that
the dredge behaves itself

57:06.333 --> 57:08.734
and we're able to get
really solid hours.

57:10.033 --> 57:11.900
Another day, another drama.

57:14.634 --> 57:16.100
One mile east...

57:19.967 --> 57:21.233
Hey, Bryan.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.867
How are your ears?

57:25.133 --> 57:26.400
Ears are good.

57:26.400 --> 57:28.200
All right. Okay.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.834
Real good.

57:29.834 --> 57:32.333
After his rookie
diver got knocked to the mat.

57:32.333 --> 57:35.533
Vernon's hoping that
veteran diver Bryan Wilder

57:35.533 --> 57:37.667
can still notch a win
on the day.

57:42.300 --> 57:43.367
All right.

57:43.367 --> 57:45.000
Keep at this for a while.

57:59.066 --> 58:00.867
Oh

58:01.533 --> 58:02.567
Hang on a minute.

58:02.567 --> 58:04.033
We got a problem
with your air.

58:11.834 --> 58:12.934
What?

58:15.300 --> 58:16.867
What the [bleep]?

58:19.667 --> 58:21.000
Come up, Bryan.
Come up.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.533
Don't come up too fast
but we're losing air.

58:27.734 --> 58:30.066
Freakin'
dammit.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.800
Dude, your air compressor
is messed up.

58:44.900 --> 58:48.233
Bryan was down
there in deep water
and suddenly, boom,

58:48.233 --> 58:50.033
he's not getting air.

58:50.033 --> 58:53.500
We caught it pretty quickly,
but sometimes divers
will panic

58:53.500 --> 58:55.433
and they'll come up too fast.

58:55.433 --> 58:58.567
The internal pressure
between the ear
and the nose

58:58.567 --> 59:00.600
can sometimes
get out of whack.

59:00.600 --> 59:02.734
And that's how you blow
out an eardrum.

59:17.700 --> 59:19.367
I need
the nose block.

59:19.367 --> 59:21.133
The nose block came out.

59:21.133 --> 59:22.533
Oh,

59:23.333 --> 59:24.734
We don't need
to take that out.

59:24.734 --> 59:26.100
Why...
why is it taken out?

59:26.100 --> 59:27.734
Oh, I took it out from Max.

59:27.734 --> 59:29.367
Forgot to put it back in.

59:29.367 --> 59:31.266
Oh,
you went down without it?

59:31.266 --> 59:32.533
Forgot.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.000
But don't
around.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.300
Do it right.

59:39.300 --> 59:43.100
Otherwise, I'll be taking
you back up
to the hospital again.

59:43.100 --> 59:45.500
Bryan removed
the nose guard
from the mask

59:45.500 --> 59:47.700
which is a pretty
stupid thing to do.

59:47.700 --> 59:51.233
And sure enough,
he came up too fast
and the pressure was severe.

59:51.233 --> 59:54.467
Last summer
he was bleeding out
of his ears.

59:54.467 --> 59:56.634
Now he's bleeding out
of his nose.

1:00:00.333 --> 1:00:02.133
Just a little bit.
It's not that bad.

1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:06.700
I feel bad
that he got hurt,
but dammit,

1:00:06.700 --> 1:00:10.834
these kinds of mistakes,
they're gonna break me
if they continue.

1:00:10.834 --> 1:00:12.667
I'll never get
the 300 ounces.

1:00:12.667 --> 1:00:15.033
I've got the storm
starting to blow in.

1:00:15.033 --> 1:00:18.500
And as it is,
I haven't made enough
for cab fare today.

1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:20.800
First bad day
in a long time.

1:00:23.100 --> 1:00:26.133
No, I'm not
satisfied with the
damn day.

1:00:26.133 --> 1:00:28.700
We didn't get any
gold in the box.

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:46.567
Hey,
we're getting an occasional
white cap up here.

1:00:46.567 --> 1:00:48.300
Just so you know.

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:55.066
As the clouds roll
in and the waves rise
ever higher,

1:00:55.066 --> 1:00:58.300
the time to throw
in the towel is fast approaching.

1:01:09.133 --> 1:01:10.266
Okay.

1:01:10.266 --> 1:01:12.567
Well, we've had a fantastic
day out here, man.

1:01:12.567 --> 1:01:15.266
You can come up
and consider it a...

1:01:15.266 --> 1:01:16.333
a successful day.

1:01:16.333 --> 1:01:17.467
No problem.

1:01:18.266 --> 1:01:19.433
Yeah.

1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:29.166
Yeah,
he's coming up.

1:01:29.166 --> 1:01:31.033
I see Zeke.
I see the light.

1:01:31.033 --> 1:01:33.133
Zeke's light is coming up.

1:01:36.367 --> 1:01:39.166
I'm bummed
that the weather is kicking us
off the water already.

1:01:39.166 --> 1:01:41.166
But I am really stoked
about today went.

1:01:41.166 --> 1:01:43.767
Steve didn't let the boat
sink and he didn't let
me drown.

1:01:43.767 --> 1:01:45.200
So that's good.

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:49.367
And also, we know that
this area of Tomcod is just
loaded with gold.

1:01:49.367 --> 1:01:51.934
This is a perfect place
for the Havilah to start off.

1:01:51.934 --> 1:01:54.400
We're gonna get her going
as soon as this storm
blows out.

1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:58.000
I'm increasingly
optimistic about a huge
rebound this summer.

1:01:59.867 --> 1:02:01.200
Perfect.

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.266
Free row.

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:06.100
Yeah. I'm kind of
anxious to get home.

1:02:06.100 --> 1:02:07.800
I'm tired.
It's been a long day.

1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:10.800
I've been on the water
for 11 hours.

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.000
11 hours, about 20 an hour.

1:02:14.667 --> 1:02:16.300
Hmm, that's $220.

1:02:20.066 --> 1:02:21.400
Everything's running great.

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:22.667
And I'm glad.

1:02:22.667 --> 1:02:24.400
I'm really glad that
I have some help.

1:02:25.133 --> 1:02:26.467
You're the man, Zeke.

1:02:26.467 --> 1:02:28.467
You're the manly man.
Man and a manly man.

1:02:33.967 --> 1:02:38.734
While the storm
gathers on the horizon,
one mile east...

1:03:00.133 --> 1:03:01.367
There you got the, Myrtle.

1:03:01.367 --> 1:03:03.066
Ooh.

1:03:04.700 --> 1:03:07.767
Mr. Gold's
business partner, Dave Young,

1:03:07.767 --> 1:03:10.467
checks in on the season's
first haul.

1:03:10.467 --> 1:03:11.934
First time out this year.

1:03:11.934 --> 1:03:15.433
I'm ready to see
what they got in there
and I can't wait.

1:03:15.433 --> 1:03:16.667
Hopefully,
it's getting the gold.

1:03:16.667 --> 1:03:17.900
We need it.

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:22.600
Go check out the box.

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:24.734
See if we have
any gold in there.

1:03:26.533 --> 1:03:28.700
With this storm
about ready to shut us down,

1:03:28.700 --> 1:03:31.867
we've got to make sure
we got solid looking
gold in the box.

1:03:31.867 --> 1:03:33.600
See anything down there?

1:03:35.066 --> 1:03:36.700
That's what
Dave is looking for.

1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:39.567
I don't want to look like
an idiot on the first trip out.

1:03:45.867 --> 1:03:48.700
Shawn, look at that.

1:03:50.367 --> 1:03:52.600
My first nugget
with Mr. Gold.

1:03:55.367 --> 1:03:56.800
Thank you.

1:03:56.800 --> 1:03:59.600
I mean, I'm gonna
keep that frame it.

1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:00.934
Framing?

1:04:02.500 --> 1:04:04.800
It's caked with gold.

1:04:06.834 --> 1:04:08.266
Look at that.

1:04:09.767 --> 1:04:11.233
Yeah!

1:04:14.767 --> 1:04:15.867
I love it.

1:04:15.867 --> 1:04:18.333
Love it when a plan
comes together.

1:04:19.433 --> 1:04:20.800
Yeah.

1:04:24.767 --> 1:04:27.634
Well the cleanup will
tell the story of
how much is in here.

1:04:27.634 --> 1:04:30.000
But it looks good.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.467
Too bad we can't get
a couple more days
before the storm, buddy.

1:04:37.467 --> 1:04:39.033
Mats are full.

1:04:39.033 --> 1:04:41.233
Yeah, I think
we're gonna just boogie in.

1:04:43.433 --> 1:04:47.066
Jack up the spuds
and we got weather
coming in

1:04:47.066 --> 1:04:53.100
and I'd rather get this gold
safe to the harbor,
in the harbor in a pan,

1:04:53.100 --> 1:04:56.533
in the safe
and in the cash,

1:04:56.533 --> 1:04:59.500
because I don't want
to push it.

1:05:01.767 --> 1:05:03.600
I've been around
the block enough times.

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:05.800
To know,
when you push it,
when you call it.

1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:08.734
Gold fever almost took
the ship down a few years ago.

1:05:09.734 --> 1:05:10.934
Mayday, Mayday.

1:05:10.934 --> 1:05:14.400
We're reading
a catastrophic tide failure.

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:18.467
Captain Ken got
greedy and stayed out
way too long.

1:05:18.467 --> 1:05:21.133
Now he's having
trouble coming in.

1:05:21.133 --> 1:05:22.767
It's not good.

1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:27.433
You don't build up
an operation like

1:05:27.433 --> 1:05:29.934
I got by making
uninformed decisions.

1:05:29.934 --> 1:05:31.266
It takes experience.

1:05:31.266 --> 1:05:32.800
You got to know
what you're doing.

1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:37.266
If not, your whole operation
along with your excavator
barge will end up

1:05:37.266 --> 1:05:40.133
out in the bottom
of the ocean floor
with the gold.

1:05:40.133 --> 1:05:42.533
Back in the safety
of the harbor.

1:05:43.433 --> 1:05:45.100
Got gold in the box.

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:46.266
Dave's happy.

1:05:46.266 --> 1:05:47.467
I'm happy.

1:05:47.467 --> 1:05:48.934
Everybody's happy.

1:05:49.900 --> 1:05:53.567
They are kicking ass,
Myrtle kicking ass.

1:05:53.567 --> 1:05:55.867
Kris Kelly is gonna
get his ass kicked.

1:05:56.266 --> 1:05:58.000
Good run.

1:06:00.233 --> 1:06:01.900
It's time to clean some gold.

1:06:03.033 --> 1:06:05.567
As Mr. Gold
pulls up to the dock.

1:06:07.467 --> 1:06:09.033
Back on Tomcod...

1:06:19.066 --> 1:06:20.300
Weather is getting worse.

1:06:20.300 --> 1:06:23.033
Wind is following the same
path as the waves

1:06:23.033 --> 1:06:25.934
which is not good
because that means
it's building.

1:06:27.834 --> 1:06:29.634
Despite
the worsening weather,

1:06:29.634 --> 1:06:33.367
Reaper Nation's still
in the throes of mining.

1:06:37.033 --> 1:06:38.500
Definitely getting out.

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:40.000
It's starting to white cap.

1:06:50.467 --> 1:06:52.967
But we kind
of need to push our luck
a little bit.

1:06:52.967 --> 1:06:54.634
We need to stick it out
a little longer.

1:06:54.634 --> 1:06:55.900
We need the gold.

1:06:58.934 --> 1:07:02.600
I thought you kind of see
what we're doing
as far as gold goes.

1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:05.200
You know, see
if it's worth fighting.

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:20.166
Test pans
are still looking great.

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:22.266
Pretty close to 100 colors.

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:30.200
It's tough
being the owner,

1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:33.133
when you're the one
with everything on the line.

1:07:33.133 --> 1:07:35.600
You're torn, you know,
pushing through
the bad weather

1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:37.400
'cause we need money
for the bills.

1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:39.266
But this equipment costs
a lot of money.

1:07:39.266 --> 1:07:42.066
And if I push too hard,
it could cost me even more.

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:56.033
It's all a balancing
act and the wrong
decision will kill you.

1:07:56.033 --> 1:07:57.433
And that's all on me.

1:08:06.467 --> 1:08:08.333
I'm gonna go
with luck of the Irish.

1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:16.400
So we're gonna
keep going.

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:20.000
Is it the right call
considering everything
I'm dealing with?

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.600
Yes, I think it is.

1:08:22.367 --> 1:08:24.400
So, bottom line,
we need the gold.

1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:25.667
So, there's no choice here.

1:08:25.667 --> 1:08:28.133
We stay.

1:08:28.133 --> 1:08:30.967
I have a huge payment
to make at the end
of the month.

1:08:30.967 --> 1:08:34.634
And we can't say
we were a bunch of

1:08:34.634 --> 1:08:37.533
that's why we didn't
make our money.

1:08:37.533 --> 1:08:41.233
They know the only way
I'm gonna get gold
is if I sit out here,

1:08:41.233 --> 1:08:43.233
14 hours a day to get it.

1:08:49.734 --> 1:08:51.900
So, this boat has to sit
out here.

1:08:53.634 --> 1:08:56.066
I think we should live life
on the edge.

1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:09.734
How's it looking,
Bryan?

1:09:10.934 --> 1:09:12.367
Pretty good.

1:09:12.367 --> 1:09:13.634
Not bad, huh?

1:09:13.634 --> 1:09:15.934
Yeah, well, you know, considering.

1:09:15.934 --> 1:09:18.100
Despite taking
a few punches,

1:09:18.100 --> 1:09:21.400
Vernon Adkison hoping
to hit the scoreboard

1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:24.433
before the upcoming storm
shuts him down.

1:09:24.433 --> 1:09:28.233
We had a compressor
kick out on us that cost us
some time.

1:09:28.233 --> 1:09:30.800
When Max went down,
he got a headache.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:34.033
And then when you came up,
you were bleeding
out the nose,

1:09:34.033 --> 1:09:35.734
at least you weren't
bleeding out the ears.

1:09:35.734 --> 1:09:37.934
Yeah.
I know.

1:09:37.934 --> 1:09:42.967
I'm not sure if we had
99 problems today,
but we were damn close.

1:09:42.967 --> 1:09:44.600
Not what we wanted.

1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:46.634
Not with this storm
blowing in.

1:09:46.634 --> 1:09:48.800
We'll see how we do
with its way out.

1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:53.333
But something's telling me
we're gonna have to do
some serious rebounding.

1:09:53.333 --> 1:09:55.734
Well let's pour
it up and see what we got.

1:10:00.967 --> 1:10:02.266
One ounce.

1:10:02.967 --> 1:10:04.367
One and half.

1:10:05.133 --> 1:10:06.433
Two.

1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:13.300
Two-point-six two ounces
for a dive day with problems?

1:10:14.834 --> 1:10:16.033
I'll take it.

1:10:16.033 --> 1:10:17.200
Yeah.

1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:18.967
2.6 ounces.

1:10:18.967 --> 1:10:20.867
It's worth over $4000.

1:10:22.667 --> 1:10:25.333
I'm trying to build a kingdom,
but with this much gold,

1:10:25.333 --> 1:10:28.467
all I can do is maybe
buy a doormat for the gate.

1:10:28.467 --> 1:10:30.033
It's not like,
"Yippee-ki-yay

1:10:30.033 --> 1:10:31.300
We're rich."

1:10:31.300 --> 1:10:35.200
But we got enough to pay
the bills and keep us
in the game.

1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:37.600
Look, this isn't getting us
where we wanna be.

1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:40.166
But Nome wasn't built
in a day.

1:10:40.166 --> 1:10:43.000
I'm confident that
we can get back out there

1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:48.800
and have smooth dives
from here on out
and get that 300 ounces.

1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:52.333
I hope to hell we'll be
able to get back on that spot.

1:10:52.333 --> 1:10:55.367
- Easy gold, but hard to hold.
- Yeah.

1:10:55.367 --> 1:10:57.700
And like some girls
I used to know.

1:11:00.233 --> 1:11:01.433
Tag it and bag it.

1:11:03.066 --> 1:11:04.867
On the outskirts
of Nome.

1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:16.667
We had water
in the filters.

1:11:16.667 --> 1:11:19.433
We're gonna like bring it in
and then swap out the filters.

1:11:19.433 --> 1:11:21.200
He ended up being right.

1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:22.300
It's looking pretty good.

1:11:22.300 --> 1:11:23.934
Yep.

1:11:23.934 --> 1:11:26.133
Despite a hiccup
with her pump engine,

1:11:26.133 --> 1:11:32.567
Emily Riedel is hoping
to keep the honeymoon
alive on claim 14.

1:11:32.567 --> 1:11:35.400
Two days out,
two days on hot gold,

1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:37.166
trying to build a legacy here.

1:11:37.166 --> 1:11:39.133
And so far, so good.

1:11:39.133 --> 1:11:42.967
We've got a storm rolling in,
so we're gonna have
a chance to see how we did.

1:11:42.967 --> 1:11:45.000
And the box looks
really good.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.233
I think we killed it.

1:11:46.233 --> 1:11:48.333
Let's see how we did here.

1:11:50.533 --> 1:11:52.000
One.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.433
Two.

1:11:54.533 --> 1:11:55.767
Three.

1:11:55.767 --> 1:11:59.033
Four, five, six, eight, nine,

1:11:59.033 --> 1:12:03.934
10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

1:12:03.934 --> 1:12:08.800
15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:10.767
What a day!

1:12:10.767 --> 1:12:11.900
All right.

1:12:11.900 --> 1:12:12.967
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

1:12:12.967 --> 1:12:16.667
20 ounces
is worth $36,000.

1:12:16.667 --> 1:12:21.500
And the newlyweds are clearly
married to a sizzling
pay streak.

1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:23.400
- Yeah, that's some
nice G, guys.
- Yep.

1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:26.600
We just... We just got
to ask for some mercy
from the Bering Sea,

1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:29.033
and we gotta keep
getting out there.

1:12:29.033 --> 1:12:31.000
It's longer.

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.734
Hopefully, that storm blows
over fast 'cause

1:12:32.734 --> 1:12:35.233
we're on Hot G
and I wanna keep hitting it.

1:12:35.233 --> 1:12:37.467
This is important.
This is critical.

1:12:37.467 --> 1:12:38.900
This is about the long term.

1:12:38.900 --> 1:12:41.333
And we've gotta get that
250 ounces going.

1:12:41.333 --> 1:12:44.033
It's not just gonna
magically appear.

1:12:44.033 --> 1:12:45.433
It's gonna be
a lot of work this summer,

1:12:45.433 --> 1:12:48.166
but I think we're positioned
perfectly to pull it off.

1:12:48.166 --> 1:12:49.467
The ground is awesome.

1:12:49.467 --> 1:12:51.700
We just get the Bering Sea
to cooperate a little bit.

1:12:51.700 --> 1:12:52.934
Yes.

1:12:53.634 --> 1:12:55.634
Absolutely.

1:12:55.634 --> 1:12:56.700
I'm feeling that.

1:12:56.700 --> 1:12:57.967
Cool.

1:12:59.867 --> 1:13:04.834
Back out
on the Bering Sea
as the storm creeps closer

1:13:04.834 --> 1:13:07.467
one team is still
on the water.

1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:16.100
We're the only ones out here.

1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:17.934
It's white capping
a little bit.

1:13:17.934 --> 1:13:20.100
We got a strong wind
from the west.

1:13:21.133 --> 1:13:22.834
It is picking up.

1:13:24.033 --> 1:13:26.433
Get [bleep] off
on the horizon.

1:13:26.433 --> 1:13:28.667
I'm just seeing nothing
but whitecaps,

1:13:29.333 --> 1:13:31.734
and I'm gonna keep digging.

1:13:33.634 --> 1:13:35.233
It's getting real dicey.

1:13:35.233 --> 1:13:38.433
We're off to a late start
and I got a huge payment
coming up.

1:13:39.266 --> 1:13:40.767
That's why
we're still out here.

1:13:40.767 --> 1:13:43.433
Everyone else,
even precious Mr. Gold,

1:13:43.433 --> 1:13:44.700
headed for cover.

1:13:56.567 --> 1:13:59.133
Honestly, maybe
they were the smart ones.

1:14:08.634 --> 1:14:12.200
Hey, let's just pack up
for the day.

1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:13.300
Let's go.

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:16.166
Yes, we can.

1:14:18.533 --> 1:14:21.667
So I really like
this location.

1:14:21.667 --> 1:14:24.700
So we're gonna drop
the marker buoy.

1:14:26.367 --> 1:14:28.333
Let's do this.

1:14:28.333 --> 1:14:31.333
We're the last to go
back into the harbor.

1:14:31.333 --> 1:14:33.500
Might as well just say

1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:36.133
Everything tells me to go
home anyways.

1:14:37.166 --> 1:14:38.266
I'm kind of pissed.

1:14:38.266 --> 1:14:39.700
I don't like to be told
what to do,

1:14:39.700 --> 1:14:42.233
but when three things
at once are telling
you what to do,

1:14:42.233 --> 1:14:45.266
you gotta listen to someone.

1:14:45.266 --> 1:14:48.600
Well, we got gold in the box
and everything is still
in one piece.

1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:49.800
Barely.

1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:52.967
As an owner,
I'm gonna chalk this up
to a huge win

1:14:52.967 --> 1:14:54.600
and get the hell out of here.

1:14:55.767 --> 1:14:57.066
We're gonna call it a day.

1:14:57.066 --> 1:14:59.900
Do our clean out and see
actually what we got.

1:14:59.900 --> 1:15:02.200
I hope to God
our cleanup is good.

1:15:04.266 --> 1:15:06.300
We've gotta see some gold.

1:15:17.367 --> 1:15:18.467
Thank you, dear.

1:15:18.467 --> 1:15:20.266
You're welcome. Enjoy.

1:15:25.066 --> 1:15:27.800
I'd like to check
in on social media
every now and then.

1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:30.367
I mean,
they're not all trolls.

1:15:30.367 --> 1:15:35.700
And now
another episode
of Social Hour with Vernon.

1:15:35.700 --> 1:15:38.734
Why is all that black stuff
in your goal after
you clean it?

1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:41.367
I like it.
That is awesome.

1:15:42.300 --> 1:15:44.634
Hey, people who buy gold,
they don't care.

1:15:44.634 --> 1:15:45.700
They melt it down.

1:15:45.700 --> 1:15:47.100
They... I'd say that
they refine it.

1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:49.467
You know, if I got time,
I'll clean it really good.

1:15:49.467 --> 1:15:52.133
If I'm in a hurry,
I don't clean it that
damn good.

1:15:52.133 --> 1:15:54.100
I think that's as good
as we're gonna get.

1:15:54.867 --> 1:15:56.333
Time for a beer.

1:15:56.333 --> 1:15:59.734
The price is the same
either way,
but thanks for asking.

1:15:59.734 --> 1:16:01.934
Let's see what else
is going on here.

1:16:01.934 --> 1:16:04.600
It looks like Vernon
has a lots of gold,

1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:08.900
but that's only because
he leaves the iron
and stuff in with the gold

1:16:08.900 --> 1:16:11.166
to increase the weight.

1:16:11.166 --> 1:16:14.133
The people that buy
the gold [bleep] about that.

1:16:14.133 --> 1:16:18.667
I mean, if we got time
we super clean the gold.

1:16:18.667 --> 1:16:21.934
So it looks nice and pretty
for everybody out there.

1:16:21.934 --> 1:16:25.200
But I guarantee you
the gold buyers they don't
give a crap about that.

1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:26.533
It doesn't matter.

1:16:26.533 --> 1:16:27.900
Price is the same.

1:16:27.900 --> 1:16:30.300
Our job is to get out there
and make gold.

1:16:30.300 --> 1:16:33.266
And sometimes we got
other things to do besides
sit around

1:16:33.266 --> 1:16:35.967
and pan gold and clean gold,
which takes hours.

1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:41.233
This has been
another episode
of Social Hour with Vernon.

1:16:41.233 --> 1:16:43.934
I mean,
they let the trolls run wild.

1:17:06.667 --> 1:17:08.033
How's it looking?

1:17:08.033 --> 1:17:10.400
Gold's looking good,
I can tell you that.

1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:11.634
I'm excited.

1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:14.133
Check it out.

1:17:14.934 --> 1:17:16.734
Weigh that sucker up.

1:17:19.300 --> 1:17:22.033
This is the first cleanup
of the season
for the Myrtle.

1:17:22.033 --> 1:17:24.000
She's our heavy hitter
on the water.

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:28.200
After doing the box check
I'm expecting a home run.

1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:30.634
I'm expecting to see
triple digits.

1:17:30.634 --> 1:17:33.166
And we got Dave
in the stands cheering.

1:17:33.166 --> 1:17:34.867
So the pressure is on.

1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:47.000
Ten, 20, 30, 40.

1:17:49.900 --> 1:17:52.500
Forty-eight.

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:54.200
Forty-eight-nine.

1:17:54.200 --> 1:17:55.734
- Little light.
- Little light, huh?

1:17:55.734 --> 1:17:56.834
Gotta get it.

1:17:56.834 --> 1:18:00.133
Gotta do a little better
than that, Shawn.

1:18:00.133 --> 1:18:07.133
48.9 ounces
is worth over $88,000,
far from Mr. Gold's hopes.

1:18:07.133 --> 1:18:11.000
Yeah, 'cause that's, you know,
a little out over
an ounce an hour.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:14.533
We wanna be on three
to four ounces an hour easily.

1:18:14.533 --> 1:18:15.767
We'll get there.
We'll get there.

1:18:15.767 --> 1:18:19.066
We're gonna have
some big clean ups,
I guarantee you.

1:18:20.767 --> 1:18:22.367
Yeah, I hope, it gets better.

1:18:22.367 --> 1:18:24.667
I was hoping
we had a 100 in there.

1:18:24.667 --> 1:18:28.934
And what I seen that box
lit up the way it was,
it's incredible.

1:18:28.934 --> 1:18:31.166
Hopefully we can get
on a little better ground.

1:18:31.166 --> 1:18:33.500
I think we need to move.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:35.734
I don't know
why we come up so light.

1:18:35.734 --> 1:18:37.734
Maybe I misjudged the ground.

1:18:37.734 --> 1:18:39.033
I don't know.

1:18:39.033 --> 1:18:40.634
But I do know one thing.

1:18:40.634 --> 1:18:44.667
I'm aiming
for 3000 ounces this year,
and this ain't gonna cut it.

1:18:44.667 --> 1:18:46.333
Not by a long shot.

1:18:46.333 --> 1:18:50.567
Now, with this big storm
kicking us off the water,
it's only gonna get worse.

1:18:50.567 --> 1:18:53.333
So I'm just gonna have
to push it harder.

1:18:53.333 --> 1:18:54.800
We're gonna have
some big days.

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:57.300
I'll tell you that, 'cause
I know there's some
pockets out there

1:18:57.300 --> 1:19:00.166
that haven't been hit
and we'll...
we'll have 100...

1:19:00.166 --> 1:19:01.900
100 ounce days.

1:19:01.900 --> 1:19:04.300
Go get the dredge
ready to go again.

1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:05.700
Go do it again.

1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:08.533
You got a lot of money
on the line.

1:19:08.533 --> 1:19:10.033
We gotta get it going.

1:19:10.033 --> 1:19:11.233
It'll pick up.

1:19:15.634 --> 1:19:16.967
Across town.

1:19:24.033 --> 1:19:27.367
So we're finishing up
our cleanup today
on the Mistress.

1:19:27.367 --> 1:19:30.300
Gonna see exactly
how much gold we're on.

1:19:31.734 --> 1:19:33.834
And I'm really hoping
for 30 ounces today.

1:19:33.834 --> 1:19:35.500
That would make me
so [bleep] happy.

1:19:36.867 --> 1:19:38.700
Please.
Pretty please.

1:19:41.033 --> 1:19:42.967
This is a big day
for Reaper nation.

1:19:42.967 --> 1:19:45.634
Maybe the most important
cleanout of my career.

1:19:45.634 --> 1:19:48.900
It's the first cleanup
as an owner of my own operation.

1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:51.734
I went for it this season.

1:19:51.734 --> 1:19:53.400
To be on target
and make our payments,

1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:56.500
we need at least
20 ounces to make
everything happen today.

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:59.100
But honestly,
I'm hoping for more like 30.

1:20:00.467 --> 1:20:03.233
We're seeing a lot
of gold move
into our little containers,

1:20:03.233 --> 1:20:06.934
which is amazing 'cause
we need as much as we can get.

1:20:06.934 --> 1:20:10.700
I'm nervous and excited
and waiting the anticipation

1:20:10.700 --> 1:20:13.300
of the final, you know,
gold count.

1:20:14.667 --> 1:20:16.433
Look, that area was hot.

1:20:16.433 --> 1:20:17.634
Shawn was there, too.

1:20:17.634 --> 1:20:19.100
We both fought over it.

1:20:20.734 --> 1:20:22.834
A lot of blood, sweat
and tears went into this.

1:20:22.834 --> 1:20:24.700
So that scale should
be loaded.

1:20:24.700 --> 1:20:26.667
It better be.

1:20:26.667 --> 1:20:28.500
Moment of truth.
Come on, baby.

1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:30.000
Okay, here it is.

1:20:45.367 --> 1:20:46.500
What do we got?

1:20:49.066 --> 1:20:51.033
Ten-point-four
seven ounces.

1:20:52.967 --> 1:20:54.266
Damn.

1:20:55.333 --> 1:20:56.700
This is tough.

1:20:57.300 --> 1:20:58.667
Man, it's terrible.

1:21:00.734 --> 1:21:03.800
This all is worth
about 18 grand.

1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:07.100
For a suction dredge,
not bad.

1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:11.567
But for Kris and his excavator
barge, not good.

1:21:14.767 --> 1:21:18.867
Which is a kick in the nuts
'cause that was like
a little under

1:21:18.867 --> 1:21:19.934
quarter ounce an hour.

1:21:19.934 --> 1:21:21.400
So quarter once an hour.

1:21:22.133 --> 1:21:23.600
And it's unacceptable.

1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:28.200
I get that working my age,
you know, I get better
than that.

1:21:31.066 --> 1:21:32.834
I know... I know
you're getting worried.

1:21:32.834 --> 1:21:34.567
I'm getting worried, too.

1:21:34.567 --> 1:21:37.867
The test pans are just
flawed obviously.

1:21:37.867 --> 1:21:41.033
You know, my problem
is I'm not underneath
the water seeing the gold,

1:21:41.033 --> 1:21:43.367
so I don't have
have any clue what we're on.

1:21:45.433 --> 1:21:48.867
So look, running
an excavation barge,
running with the big dogs,

1:21:48.867 --> 1:21:50.367
I thought it was gonna
be easier.

1:21:50.367 --> 1:21:51.500
It wasn't.

1:21:51.500 --> 1:21:53.600
Like I'm stressed
beyond belief.

1:21:55.133 --> 1:21:58.367
I may barely be able
to stay above water
this summer.

1:21:58.367 --> 1:22:00.467
We'll see.

1:22:00.467 --> 1:22:04.734
All I can do is dust myself
off and have faith that
it's gonna get better.

1:22:04.734 --> 1:22:06.333
Like immediately.

1:22:06.333 --> 1:22:08.000
Little bummed out
after that.

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:09.133
I'm a little bummed, too.

1:22:09.133 --> 1:22:11.066
But, you know,
it's a new operation.

1:22:11.066 --> 1:22:12.567
We're learning, Kris.

1:22:12.567 --> 1:22:15.200
I'm not... not throwing
my hands up and saying,
"I give up." You know?

1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:18.000
No. I'm just saying, look,
you know, literally my...

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.700
my six inch operation
gets more gold in this
thing right now.

1:22:20.700 --> 1:22:22.033
This is really...
this is embarrassing.

1:22:22.033 --> 1:22:23.400
Yeah,
this is embarrassing.

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:25.066
We gotta turn this around.

1:22:25.066 --> 1:22:26.266
It'll get better.

1:22:26.266 --> 1:22:27.667
- Yep.
- It'll get better.

1:22:27.667 --> 1:22:29.166
I'm hoping.
It can't get any worse.

1:22:32.367 --> 1:22:36.700
Shawn takes
the early lead,
but it's still anyone's game.

1:22:41.233 --> 1:22:43.867
Next dive
on Bering Sea Gold...

1:22:43.867 --> 1:22:45.934
Then giant storm
surge coming.

1:22:45.934 --> 1:22:47.266
It's like...

1:22:47.266 --> 1:22:50.000
We gotta really take
advantage of this good
weather window.

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.867
We're gonna send Rick down
and kind of see what
we're working with.

1:22:52.867 --> 1:22:55.033
We're going into a bad
weather situation,

1:22:55.033 --> 1:22:57.533
but I know the boat
can handle it.

1:22:57.533 --> 1:23:00.500
It's a last bridge
on the Cougar Rock Road.

1:23:00.500 --> 1:23:01.767
You should have said

1:23:01.767 --> 1:23:03.233
That take on your life
and your ass.

1:23:03.233 --> 1:23:04.500
Ready to go.

1:23:04.500 --> 1:23:06.734
He's tried to do this
before with girlfriends
I think.

1:23:06.734 --> 1:23:08.066
It didn't work out.

1:23:08.700 --> 1:23:09.934
Tenhoff.

1:23:09.934 --> 1:23:13.867
Pretty excited to see
what these rocks
and those got here.

1:23:13.867 --> 1:23:16.967
We're gonna end up
snapping its spud cable.

1:23:16.967 --> 1:23:18.600
What [bleep] We're spinning.

1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:20.166
We gotta get out of here.

1:23:20.166 --> 1:23:21.567
We're on
the right track.

1:23:21.567 --> 1:23:23.100
The gold is just
unbelievably hot.

1:23:27.900 --> 1:23:29.467
Yeah, baby!
