Dr. Miller,
I need your help.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.270
[Bleep], you say?

17:51.538 --> 17:53.840
Kenneth: JJ. Dude!

17:53.873 --> 17:56.443
Hold up, man.
Listen, you're right.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.379
It's not fair that I get
to put up these walls

17:59.412 --> 18:00.880
and you can't with me.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.151
So I think it's only fair
that I reveal myself to you.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.689
"Are you going to
show me your..."

18:09.722 --> 18:11.224
No!

18:11.258 --> 18:13.760
But I am gonna show you
my emotional penis.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.463
Mind your business,
Deshaun!

18:18.064 --> 18:20.533
I'm proud of the man I am
when I'm working with you.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.902
I'm less proud of the me
who's been divorced twice

18:22.935 --> 18:26.239
and goes by "HotTubHercules"
on Yahoo! Personals.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.708
So I tried to...
keep him from you.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.845
"Yikes. I wish you had."

18:32.879 --> 18:35.014
[ Both laugh ]

18:35.047 --> 18:37.717
Well, I-I hope
you're ready to see it --

18:37.750 --> 18:41.854
the full, complex portrait
that is Kenneth.

18:41.888 --> 18:45.525
"We've got a Spanish teacher
to talk to."

[ Chuckles ]

18:49.662 --> 18:51.264
Oh, hi, Kenneth.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.566
And you must be JJ.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.302
Well, um, Ms. Moreno,

18:55.335 --> 18:58.471
we're gonna start a year
in your class, but...

18:58.505 --> 19:00.440
I need you
to know something.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.177
I have feelings for you --

19:04.211 --> 19:07.580
big, bold,
Technicolor feelings.

19:07.614 --> 19:11.117
I'm ready to be
with someone special.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.921
Kenneth,
I am so flattered.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.824
But...I don't feel that way
about you.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.092
I just...don't.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.294
I'm sorry.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.163
Oh. [ Chuckles ]

19:24.197 --> 19:26.399
You -- What,
you thought that was me?

19:26.433 --> 19:28.235
No, that -- that was JJ.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.569
I was reading for him.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.504
You know, that's how this works.
You'll get used to it.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.640
Oh, JJ.
[ Whimpers ]

19:33.673 --> 19:35.442
Oh, baby.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.776
Oh!
It takes guts,

19:36.809 --> 19:38.778
but you gonna be all right,
dawg, okay?

19:38.811 --> 19:40.146
You'll find
that special lady.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.981
[ Whimpers ]

19:42.014 --> 19:44.851
JJ needs to be at the school
and he needs Kenneth,

19:44.884 --> 19:47.287
but I can't shortchange
those other families.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.389
I thought I had this
whole "special needs mom"
thing figured out,

19:49.422 --> 19:52.859
and it turns out I don't know
how to do any of it.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.828
You did the exact right thing --
you came to me.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.530
Oh, good.
So, what's the solution?

19:57.564 --> 19:58.965
Oh, I have no clue.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.032
I'm looking
at this budget,

20:00.066 --> 20:02.168
and I can't free up
another nickel!

20:02.201 --> 20:05.372
I already pay a ton of employees
I can't fire who do nothing --

20:05.405 --> 20:07.006
just absolute loads.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.575
We can't hire anyone new.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.878
Those absolute loads
who do nothing...

20:14.481 --> 20:15.682
...show them to me.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

20:17.083 --> 20:18.385
Hi, Leah.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.119
Hey, Dylan.
Hi, everyone.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.489
I guess you're all
new here.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.892
I'm new most years, but I think
I've been doing it wrong.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.228
Maybe I can give you guys
some tips on how to do it right.

20:29.262 --> 20:32.332
First off, it's probably
a good idea to let people in,

20:32.365 --> 20:33.633
get to know them.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.302
That's really nice,

20:35.335 --> 20:38.505
but all of us have been here
for, like, five years.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.873
Oh, great. Can you show me
where everything is?

20:40.907 --> 20:44.210
Take a long, last look
at these worthless losers,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.879
'cause I'm gonna turn 'em
into full-time aides.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.781
Welcome to Hell, losers!

20:50.817 --> 20:52.585
I told them this was
a Popsicle party.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.753
And one for you,
and one...

20:56.956 --> 20:58.425
And I know, I-I-I-I bought
this one earlier,

20:58.458 --> 21:00.927
and this one seems perfect,
but $3.99.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.233
Can I confess something?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.201
It's not about the loofah.
It's about the shower.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.572
I-I've hung too much on it,
and now it's finally here.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.541
I'm gonna be disappointed.
I know it.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.577
And on the off-chance it is
as amazing as I've dreamed,

21:17.610 --> 21:18.578
then what?

21:20.012 --> 21:22.449
I live out my days knowing
I'll never be that happy again?

21:23.683 --> 21:26.586
Do you want to consider
a washcloth?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.555
I'm in a hell
of my own making, Kelsey.
