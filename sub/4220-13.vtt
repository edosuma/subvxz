WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.543
How long you staying, Pop?

00:02.628 --> 00:04.295
Depends.
Depends on what?

00:04.505 --> 00:07.590
I'm Stage Four.
Gave me about
four months to live...

00:07.883 --> 00:10.802
Look, Leslie Shay wasn't just
some victim in this fire.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.720
She was my partner.
And his best friend.

00:12.805 --> 00:15.473
No guarantees, all right?
But let me see if I can
take a look.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.061
Dawson!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.605
Oh, my God.
This was arson.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.440
Which would mean
that Shay was murdered.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.609
And whoever did it
is still out there.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.572
So, where on the scene
did you find this?

00:31.657 --> 00:33.825
It was buried into
the ground between the

00:33.951 --> 00:35.284
burn pattern
and the propane tanks.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.661
Under some debris.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.912
Did you get pictures?

00:39.081 --> 00:40.206
Uh...

00:40.916 --> 00:42.333
So you removed this
from the scene

00:42.418 --> 00:44.335
without documenting
its original location?

00:44.795 --> 00:46.713
You said you couldn't
investigate without
further evidence.

00:46.797 --> 00:47.964
I just brought
you evidence.

00:52.344 --> 00:55.805
Okay. You're right.
Thank you.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.559
So what now?
Now, let me do my job.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.727
You wait to hear
from me.

01:09.153 --> 01:10.653
Joey, can you get that?

01:10.821 --> 01:12.196
Yeah, sure.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.787
Uh, hi.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.331
Baba!

01:31.467 --> 01:35.052
Yeah, uh, Crotis!
Cro-tis! Crotis.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.555
This is my grandma!

01:37.639 --> 01:39.557
This is your grandma?
Yes, man!

01:39.975 --> 01:42.518
She's staying with us.
I texted you this.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.354
You did not text me this.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.023
A month ago, I texted you.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.233
A month requires an email.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.278
Does she even speak English?
Not a word.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.199
I can't believe it.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.201
What if we hadn't gotten
called to that storage unit?

01:59.328 --> 02:00.953
We never
would've known.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.998
Things happen for a reason,
fellas. I believe that.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.751
Gabby?

02:07.419 --> 02:08.669
Megan! Hey.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.007
I got on the
first plane.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.636
Uh, guys,
you remember Megan,
Leslie's sister.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.054
Of course.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.056
Welcome back to Chicago.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.393
Really glad you
could make it out.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.897
I can't believe this is
really happening. Arson?

02:29.233 --> 02:30.441
Looking more
and more like it.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.401
So Leslie was murdered?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.866
Office of Fire
Investigation, they're...

02:38.951 --> 02:40.076
They're looking into it.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.495
Megan...

02:43.914 --> 02:46.040
Welcome back to 51.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.253
Thanks, Chief Boden.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.548
Kelly, you have a
phone call in my office.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.383
It's Kevin Hadley.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.760
What?

02:57.970 --> 02:59.679
What's that
son of a bitch want?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.806
It's a collect call from
Stateville Penitentiary.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.266
He'll only talk to Kelly.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.615
What do you want, Hadley?

03:19.783 --> 03:21.951
Aren't you gonna
ask me how I'm doing?
No.

03:22.327 --> 03:25.204
Well, I'm doing fine.
Thank you.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.373
And I want to invite you
to come and visit me.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.583
See for yourself.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.209
I'll pass, thanks.

03:30.294 --> 03:33.004
Okay. But...

03:33.088 --> 03:35.756
that fire that killed Shay?

03:38.176 --> 03:41.387
You're just realizing
it was arson, aren't you?

03:48.312 --> 03:52.481
Got your attention now, huh?
Come see me in person.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.109
Just you.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.327
Well, get on with it.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.791
You never did
have any patience.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.209
You're out
of your mind.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.418
Am I?

04:56.171 --> 05:00.549
Or did I get something
in the mail that you're
gonna want to see?

05:03.720 --> 05:07.974
But first, I want you
to get me a new mattress.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.312
They got these special
mattresses for people

05:14.231 --> 05:15.564
in chronic pain.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.567
And the warden
won't order me one.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.612
Kevin,

05:23.073 --> 05:24.949
I don't know the warden.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.869
And I'm not the
District Attorney
looking to make a deal.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.518
That came out of the blue.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.521
I don't know who.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.773
There was no name
on the envelope.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.942
On the envelope,

06:02.404 --> 06:04.113
there is a return address.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.450
And a nice,
clear postmark.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.329
Where is it?

06:13.457 --> 06:15.624
You get me the mattress,

06:18.628 --> 06:20.796
and I'll get you
the envelope.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.269
Okay, Gabriela,
full disclosure?

06:36.271 --> 06:38.147
I wanted no part of this.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.774
But my parents insisted
that I get out here

06:39.858 --> 06:42.193
and come home
with some answers. So...

06:42.694 --> 06:45.696
I always had it in my head
that it was the job that
killed her.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.867
This house,

06:51.536 --> 06:53.079
I could barely
walk inside.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.292
Hey, Brett, this is
Shay's sister, Megan.

06:58.376 --> 07:02.129
Um, this is Sylvie Brett,
she's the new paramedic on 61.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.173
Great to meet you.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.426
Um, I didn't know your sister,
but everyone here says

07:07.511 --> 07:09.220
she was one in a million.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.554
That's true.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.435
My assistant said the
hotel lost my reservation.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.812
You guys don't know
of a place nearby

07:17.896 --> 07:19.563
that doesn't have
four locks on the door?

07:19.648 --> 07:21.273
A hotel? No.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.943
You're gonna stay with us.
Yeah!

07:24.027 --> 07:26.529
You guys are living together?
What happened to you and Matt?

07:27.197 --> 07:30.699
Um, we gave it
our best shot.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.912
Don't say another word.
It's done.
You're staying with us.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.083
You sure?
Without a doubt.
Come on.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.045
How'd it go?

07:43.880 --> 07:44.922
He's...

07:45.006 --> 07:47.341
He said someone sent him
something from Shay's fire.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.219
What does that mean?
I don't know.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.304
Warden's tossing
his cell right now.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.477
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.646
Structure fire.
Randolph and LaSalle.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.951
Find out if there's
anyone inside.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.704
Sometimes these places
lock their cleaning crews
inside at night.

08:16.788 --> 08:17.830
On it, Chief.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.999
Capp, Newhouse.
Get the Arcair torches.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.085
Herrmann, Mouch, load up
on spare rods for 'em.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.056
Fire Department!
Call out!
Hey, door's locked.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.812
If anyone's inside,
let us know where you are!

08:41.897 --> 08:43.314
Sir! We need access.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.859
On your side of the door,
there should be a panic bar
that you can press.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.068
Sir!

08:57.954 --> 08:59.955
How much longer?
Another five minutes.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.665
That is not good enough.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.669
Chief, this is
bullet-proof glass.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.380
The arc torch would
cut through the glass
in the window.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.257
If I take off my gear,
I can fit through that frame.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.802
Okay. Severide, Newhouse,
I need you on that window.
Come on.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.304
Let's go.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.235
Pass it to me
once I'm on the other side.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.319
You got it.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.499
Locate the janitor,
get him to the door,
and hit the panic bar.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.167
Right.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.145
I got the victim!
He's alive!

10:19.160 --> 10:20.369
Casey!

10:20.787 --> 10:22.621
Casey. Report!

10:29.421 --> 10:31.088
Ceiling came down, Chief.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.840
Okay, can you
get through?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.135
Casey!

11:00.243 --> 11:01.827
He's over here.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.051
Hey.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.055
I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine.
You took a couple of
good lungfuls of smoke.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.556
Take a deep breath.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.356
Hey,
good job in there.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.527
Okay, you're good.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.785
Damn, baby,
don't scare me like that.

11:49.417 --> 11:53.045
As if she's confessing
something, I want you to
treat me like a donkey.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.382
- You didn't.
- Yes. Yes, that is...

11:56.883 --> 11:58.884
She smacked you?
Yeah...

12:02.639 --> 12:07.142
Donkey? That's the
wrong way to get to me!
Oh, my God, I love it!

12:19.864 --> 12:21.990
Oh, hey, listen, um...

12:23.034 --> 12:26.245
So, Saturday is the
three-month anniversary
of Sylvie and me.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.539
Yeah, when you became
the beast with two backs?

12:29.332 --> 12:31.333
Our first date, all right?
Look, whatever.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.377
When is Grandma
leaving, all right?

12:33.461 --> 12:36.088
'Cause Dawson's still
at Brett's place, and now
Shay's sister's there too,

12:36.172 --> 12:37.798
and I want to invite
Sylvie over to our place...

12:37.882 --> 12:40.134
She's not.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.803
She's not what?

12:43.138 --> 12:45.889
Baba's moving
in with us, dude.
Yeah!

12:46.975 --> 12:49.518
What?
I texted you this.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.813
You can't text
something like that.
That's a discussion...

12:52.897 --> 12:55.357
Hey, it's not my fault
you don't check your texts.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.319
Joe, you know what?

13:03.616 --> 13:07.202
When I wanted to
become a firefighter,
my parents flipped out.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.788
They wanted me to
become a doctor like
Vlad and Dimitri.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.208
Now, my grandma
calls me from Russia
and she says to me,

13:13.877 --> 13:18.005
"Your mother moved to
America to follow her dreams.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.549
"Now, you follow yours."

13:21.926 --> 13:25.304
I'm here because of my
grandma, so if I have
to share a room with her,

13:26.389 --> 13:27.556
I will.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.229
I'm looking for
Kelly Severide.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.522
Yeah, right here.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.734
I got a delivery
from Warden Aynesworth
at Stateville Penitentiary.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.119
Hey, Chief?
Hey.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.914
So I already looked up
the return address.
It's just a...

13:52.040 --> 13:55.375
Just a vacant lot.
I think Hadley's
messing with us.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.258
What?

14:13.311 --> 14:14.436
Chief.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.189
There is no way that
Hadley could've known
about that address.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.316
What...
What do you mean?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.610
That is the fire where
we lost Henry Mills.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.534
It's the fire where
I got burned up myself.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.121
So these are connected?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.624
It would seem so.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.678
If the same guy
set both fires,

14:47.762 --> 14:49.888
he's been flying under
the radar for 20 years.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.515
Why... Why try and
get our attention now?

14:51.599 --> 14:54.268
Well, you found
his storage unit
and interrupted him.

14:54.519 --> 14:58.814
Meticulous planners
like this don't do
well with exposure.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.066
So, what's gonna
be his next move?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.485
Mmm, that's the
million dollar question.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.698
But I know he's
gonna want control back.
However he has to get it.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.867
So, what do we
have here?

15:11.244 --> 15:14.913
Well, there's no way that
this guy only started two
fires, 20 years apart.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.206
Or three.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.791
All signs point
to a serial arsonist.

15:17.875 --> 15:22.087
Which is why we're
mapping out any suspected
but unsolved arson fires

15:22.171 --> 15:25.382
during the
time period that used
a similar methodology.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.259
Next, we'll check
the buildings for
common ownership.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.886
Then we'll look at geography
and calendar groupings.

15:29.971 --> 15:32.180
Well, I think the geography
speaks for itself.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.186
Yeah. It's a start.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.945
You wanted to see me?
Yeah. Come on in.
Have a seat.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.204
Someone,
we don't know who,
sent Kevin Hadley

15:56.289 --> 15:59.249
a copy of an article
about the fire
that killed Shay.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.712
It was one of the same
articles as was found
in the storage locker.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.893
The return address
on the envelope

16:18.853 --> 16:21.188
was the site of
the McFarland fire

16:22.565 --> 16:24.775
where your father died.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.866
Now, we don't know
anything else.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.244
Arson Investigation
are looking into it.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.125
So it's, uh,
the same guy?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.879
My dad's fire
was an arson?

16:46.422 --> 16:48.840
Someone certainly
wants us to think so.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.676
The arsonist?

16:52.428 --> 16:53.428
Maybe.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.647
So, and that's it?

17:04.941 --> 17:08.026
You...
You bring me in here,
you drop this on me,

17:08.111 --> 17:10.237
and you give me a,
"They're looking into it?"

17:10.321 --> 17:12.739
What the hell am
I supposed to do with
that information, Chief?

17:12.824 --> 17:16.952
Nothing, for now, but please
understand how important it is
that you keep a clear head.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.122
Keep your distance,
let everybody do their jobs.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.332
Are you serious?
I... I can't...
Peter, I promise you,

17:22.417 --> 17:25.210
if this is true, I will not
rest until justice is served.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.462
I will serve it
myself if I have to.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.383
But I need you
to trust me.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.069
That is so her.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.530
It reminds me of
Amy-Lou Schmeckle.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.741
Mmm-hmm.
That's a real person?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.826
Oh, hand to God.
Leslie's first love.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.662
She was that girl
who knew about bands
you've never heard of

18:00.747 --> 18:03.123
and movies that only
play at one theater.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.459
And my sister was a
knockout, of course.
Mmm-hmm.

18:05.543 --> 18:09.421
And every guy in the school
was just falling all over
themselves to date her.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.341
So one day, I come
rushing home, excited about,
I don't know, who knows what,

18:13.426 --> 18:16.178
and I burst into
Leslie's room, because
that's what we did,

18:16.262 --> 18:19.806
and there she is,
Leslie with
Amy-Lou Schmeckle,

18:19.891 --> 18:22.309
both their shirts off,
kissing!

18:22.393 --> 18:27.564
And all I could think
of was screaming, "Mom!"
at the top of my lungs.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.484
And she pulled me
into the room and, uh,

18:30.568 --> 18:33.361
she just looks at me
and she said, "Sister,

18:33.446 --> 18:34.571
"we gotta talk."

18:35.323 --> 18:37.032
She just laid it all out.

18:38.409 --> 18:41.077
"I like girls."
Simple as that.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.374
That was Leslie.

18:50.713 --> 18:51.922
God, I miss her.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.477
Hey. Uh, Dawson in?
I need to talk to her.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.270
Yeah, of course.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.942
Um, Megan, you wanna
help me put the finishing
touches on a pear tart?

19:13.069 --> 19:14.986
I want to hear this.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.988
All of these
were set by our guy?

19:17.073 --> 19:19.658
Right now,
it's just a theory,
but the MOs match.

19:20.243 --> 19:23.036
How many had fatalities?
Four more.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.374
If he's an excitement
arsonist, then he's
in it for the chaos.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.376
He doesn't set out to kill,
but he doesn't care
if he does.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.127
So, what do we do?

19:33.047 --> 19:35.423
Cunningham said
she's on it.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.678
Which one
killed Leslie?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.270
That one.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.569
You better find
that son of a bitch
and make him pay.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.202
She's got this...

20:04.996 --> 20:08.373
I don't know if innocence
is the right word,

20:08.457 --> 20:12.043
but earnestness about
the way that she does
her job.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.881
And not everybody was crazy
about her in the beginning,
trust me.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.216
But it wasn't
Sylvie's fault,
it's like,

20:18.301 --> 20:21.344
she was replacing Shay,
and how's anybody
supposed to do that?

20:22.513 --> 20:26.641
It's like God looked down
on me and he said, "Joe,
you've been through enough.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.727
"You deserve more."

20:29.312 --> 20:31.813
What are you doing?
Talking to Baba.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.357
You know she
doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.650
I know.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.778
It's perfect.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.580
Okay, Baba.

20:48.664 --> 20:52.250
Okay, Baba.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.462
Oh, hey, Megan,
you should ride with
Brett and Mills today.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.380
You can see
what your sister's
world was all about.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.716
Oh, tempting, but I...
I actually should do

20:59.842 --> 21:02.010
some work on some
client files.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.223
Ambulance 61,
man in distress.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.767
1,200 Block.
Hastings Street.
Not a second thought.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.060
You're ours.

21:26.118 --> 21:30.121
Police! Police! Police!

21:31.540 --> 21:34.084
Police! Police!

21:34.293 --> 21:36.294
Hey, I...
Hey, I don't wanna
hurt anybody.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.506
Ma'am, did you dial 911?
He's been standing
out here for 20 minutes.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.425
He kept telling me to call
the police, which I did.
So they send an ambulance.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.969
- This city...
- Police!

21:44.053 --> 21:45.178
Why do you need
the police, sir?

21:45.262 --> 21:47.639
He's got mental problems,
obviously.
Okay.

21:48.057 --> 21:52.352
Sir, are you injured?
I'm telling you that I
don't wanna hurt anyone.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.897
And I told her to
call the cops before
something bad happens!

21:55.982 --> 21:58.525
I'm calling in a 10-1.
Wait. Just hold up.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.193
Sir,

22:02.238 --> 22:04.239
what's going on with you?

22:04.824 --> 22:08.702
Okay, we're calling the
police, but if there's a way
that we can help, let us know.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.537
You can help me
by calling the cops!

22:10.621 --> 22:14.499
Okay, are you
on any medication?
Police! Police! Police!

22:14.583 --> 22:17.460
All right.
Hey, dispatch, we need
police here at 1200 Hastings.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.045
We got a man here
with mental distress.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.839
Why is nobody
listening to me?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.134
Hey!

22:30.725 --> 22:34.185
I'm so... so sorry.
I know you don't
wanna hurt me.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.605
No, but I have to.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.360
Come on.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.196
Tell them I'm armed
and dangerous.

22:45.281 --> 22:49.159
Say it just like that.
Armed and dangerous.
All right, nut job, I got it.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.622
Hey, what'd he do?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.916
He came at me
with a knife.
It's right there.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.295
Got it.
Yeah.
He's armed and dangerous.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.298
Thank you.
What?

23:03.632 --> 23:07.302
It's a parole violation.
I'm not cut out for the
outside.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.887
Come on, let's go.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.141
All right, people,
nothing to see here. Come on.
Hey.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.559
You okay?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.770
Yeah, you?
Yeah, of course.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.319
Yo.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.658
Megan, you okay?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.494
I'm fine, really.

23:32.578 --> 23:37.499
This is par for the course.
And not even in the top ten
of scary calls, trust me.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.417
That's what she did?

23:40.711 --> 23:44.589
She went through that
every day and she never
said anything to me.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.759
I'd ask her how
her day was and
she would just

23:47.843 --> 23:50.845
make some inappropriate
joke to get me laughing.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.433
I had no idea.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.144
Listen,

23:59.647 --> 24:01.606
that is the way
that Shay was.

24:02.817 --> 24:06.027
I mean, she never wanted
anyone to waste any time
worrying about her.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.321
She just wanted to
make everyone smile.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.405
Yeah.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.993
Yeah.
Yeah, she did.

24:15.830 --> 24:20.041
Let's go back to the house,
get some hot chocolate.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.711
I'm glad I came.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.134
Come on.

24:35.224 --> 24:38.601
I don't even understand
where Baba's sleeping.
I have bunk beds.

24:40.271 --> 24:42.564
You put the
babushka on a bunk?

24:43.232 --> 24:45.066
She grew up
sleeping in a barn.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.111
It's not like I make her
sleep on the top bunk.
Most nights.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.905
Look, I'll admit
that Baba has
her certain charms,

24:50.990 --> 24:53.700
but you gotta take her out
to dinner or something
tomorrow night, all right?

24:53.784 --> 24:56.786
Sylvie's coming at 9:00 p.m.,
and you will not ruin this
for me.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.914
I'm telling you,
it's zero problem, man.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.792
Baba goes to sleep
at 8:00 p.m. You won't
even know she's there.

25:04.795 --> 25:05.837
Yeah!

25:05.921 --> 25:07.922
Have you guys seen
Kelly Severide?

25:08.465 --> 25:11.342
Uh, yes, Captain.
I think I saw him
at Boden's office.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.595
Head inside
and hook a left.
Okay, thanks.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.014
Captain.
Afternoon, Captain.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.056
Afternoon.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.641
Come on, now,
don't get nervous.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.019
- Wow.
- Oh, come on!

25:21.103 --> 25:23.646
You got nervous!
You've played this
before, right?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.401
Come in.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.613
Hey.
Hey.

25:32.823 --> 25:36.326
I've pulled a bunch of
photos of arsonists we've
suspected over the years

25:36.410 --> 25:38.620
but haven't been
able to prosecute.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.830
Do you mind if I borrow
Kelly for an hour?

25:43.125 --> 25:44.375
What for?

25:45.336 --> 25:47.045
Intimidation.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.719
None of these guys have
rented a storage unit from me.
Nope.

25:55.638 --> 25:58.389
That guy looks crazy,
but... nope.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.017
Okay...
I'm gonna need you
to concentrate.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.729
Any faces that look even
vaguely familiar might
help us to narrow this down.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.816
Sure, sure. Look, I show
'em a space, get a credit
card, and forget 'em.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.527
It's not like
there's a lot of personal...

26:13.239 --> 26:15.698
Hold on.
This one?

26:17.451 --> 26:21.120
This guy, he's a...
He's a customer here.

26:21.205 --> 26:24.916
His chin is stronger, like
maybe he gained some weight.
But, uh...

26:25.000 --> 26:27.043
I recognize that guy.
No doubt.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.754
You're sure?

26:29.838 --> 26:31.756
He rents a space here.
I'm sure of it.

26:37.596 --> 26:42.100
Adrian Gish, 47,
twice accused of arson.
Cleared both times.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.435
And he lives
right in the middle
of the hot zone.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.356
My predecessor had him
in twice for questioning.
He came in voluntarily.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.068
But there wasn't a sniff
of proof and the department
decided not to pursue.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.028
Last we heard,
he works here.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.698
So we arrest him.

26:57.449 --> 27:01.202
We ask him to
come in again, have a
conversation with him.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.370
See if he'll go
on the record.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.123
You let me
do the talking.
Yeah.

27:05.749 --> 27:09.961
Excuse me.
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt
your conversation, but are...

27:10.045 --> 27:13.006
Are you a firefighter?
Yeah, I am.

27:13.424 --> 27:16.384
I thought I recognized
you from the news.

27:17.386 --> 27:20.221
Terrible collapse
a few months ago.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.225
Another firefighter
was killed, right?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.228
A paramedic?

27:27.980 --> 27:31.899
Horrible,
horrible tragedy,
just, just awful.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.777
Lunch break.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.947
What's your name?

27:38.699 --> 27:40.491
You already know that.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.247
Okay, fine, Adrian.

27:47.750 --> 27:51.210
You mind if we
ask you some questions?
Somewhere more private?

27:51.295 --> 27:55.131
Oh, man,
I wish I could, but my
break's almost over, so...

27:56.258 --> 27:57.675
Did you start the fire?

28:00.596 --> 28:03.181
Let me ask you
a question, hmm?

28:04.933 --> 28:07.560
What'd you have
to do to become
a firefighter, huh?

28:07.644 --> 28:09.354
You have to take
a lot of tests?

28:09.938 --> 28:13.024
Hold your breath
a long time?
I can do that.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.817
Maybe I can get
an application?

28:15.652 --> 28:17.945
Yeah, sure,
you come by 51,
we'll get you one.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.490
Then we'll talk.
Kelly.

28:20.741 --> 28:24.035
No, he wants to get
something off his chest,
let's let him, huh?

28:24.119 --> 28:26.746
- Right, Adrian?
- All done.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.123
It was nice
meeting you two.

28:32.336 --> 28:36.339
Oh, please accept
my condolences on the
loss of your paramedic.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.719
Now that I think about it,
her name was Shay, right?

28:45.641 --> 28:47.308
She was really pretty.

28:48.519 --> 28:49.811
Photogenic.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.861
No, Kelly.
Not like this.

29:04.118 --> 29:08.246
It's not like we
get a lot of sleep on shift,
but this is the place.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.164
It's nicer than I pictured.

29:10.249 --> 29:15.211
Trust me, you get
20 guys in here snoring
and blowing gas all night...

29:16.380 --> 29:18.464
it's a
different story.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.681
This was Leslie's.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.268
I...
I don't need to...

29:41.530 --> 29:45.241
First day,
she waltzes in here,

29:45.742 --> 29:47.410
drops her stuff,

29:48.162 --> 29:51.038
strips down,
bare-ass nude

29:52.124 --> 29:54.625
and walks to the shower.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.545
No one knew
what to do.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.260
We miss her, Megan.

30:05.721 --> 30:08.723
She was the heartbeat of...

30:20.736 --> 30:22.403
We all move on, right?

30:26.074 --> 30:27.950
But you never forget.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.370
Not a girl like Shay.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.004
I'm doing a bang-up job
of making you feel better,
huh?

30:40.088 --> 30:43.674
No, actually
you are, Chris.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.720
Thank you.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.435
Hey, guys. It's time.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.646
Time for what?

30:58.065 --> 30:59.941
You're gonna
wanna see this.

31:34.142 --> 31:38.271
I have a love-hate
relationship with these
ceremonies.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.483
Each one is a reminder
that we lost
a member of our family.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.612
Leslie Shay
was a great paramedic.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.700
There are no words
that can fill the
hole that she left.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.747
The woman who rode
alongside her, from her
first day to her last,

31:56.832 --> 31:59.166
Gabriela Dawson,
would like to say some words.

32:09.678 --> 32:14.015
A lot's changed at 51
since losing Shay.

32:15.684 --> 32:20.104
We've welcomed in
new friends,
we got a new rig.

32:22.024 --> 32:26.694
And uh...
And a dream of mine
came true.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.574
But here's
what hasn't changed.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.702
This house,

32:36.288 --> 32:37.872
this family.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.043
It's all as strong
as it ever was.

32:43.253 --> 32:45.254
Stronger even,

32:46.882 --> 32:49.508
because I think, um...

32:51.470 --> 32:54.430
I think that deep down,
in the quiet moments,

32:55.932 --> 32:59.310
we think to ourselves
Shay would want us
to be better.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.564
She'd want us to
lean on each other.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.735
And she'd want
us to represent her
every time we go out.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.241
You had an amazing
sister, Megan.

33:16.203 --> 33:19.789
And I am so lucky to
have been her friend.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.579
51 will always
be Leslie Shay's home.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.999
The people in it will
always be her family.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.378
Detail.

34:07.671 --> 34:10.798
Attention!

34:12.759 --> 34:15.803
Present arms!

34:35.615 --> 34:38.451
Order arms!

35:09.024 --> 35:11.317
I really appreciated
what you said today.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.527
I'm sure Megan did, too.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.573
Hardest thing I've had
to do in a long time.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.909
I thought you
handled it brilliantly.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.126
Did we blow it?

35:32.380 --> 35:33.589
Yeah.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.220
Or I did.
I don't know.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.434
Ah, I just, I wanted to
be a candidate so badly.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.065
I'm sorry.

35:52.818 --> 35:53.901
I'm sorry, too.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.447
But, you know, you're
a hell of a firefighter,

35:59.366 --> 36:02.076
and I'm not sorry
I'm the one who
gets to lead you.

36:03.078 --> 36:06.747
And I get to look
out for you too,
if I'm being honest.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.922
Can we...

36:16.091 --> 36:18.467
Can we just...
Just put us on hold?

36:18.885 --> 36:22.263
And we can see where
we are with work,
with life...

36:22.347 --> 36:23.430
Down the road?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.226
Maybe then we
can start new.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.272
Yeah, I'd like that.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.655
Oh, hey, did you...

36:39.739 --> 36:42.950
Wait, did you hear that Otis's
grandma moved in with him?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.702
What?
Yeah.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.121
And she sleeps
in the bunk bed.

36:47.247 --> 36:48.622
Where, on top?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.375
Yeah, well, I mean,
he says no, but you know
Otis and his small bladder.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.889
Come in.
Mmm.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.182
I brought tequila.
Oh!

37:08.518 --> 37:10.561
I usually bring wine...
Mmm.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.856
But I thought,
"Why not mix it up?"

37:13.940 --> 37:17.610
And the guy from the
liquor store said this
was the good stuff.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.405
Yes, it is.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.073
Here, let me
take your coat.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.826
So, I thought,
uh, we could watch
a movie or something...

37:26.953 --> 37:28.370
Really?

37:31.291 --> 37:32.541
Bad idea.

37:33.668 --> 37:36.754
It is our three month
anniversary, Joe.
Mmm...

37:36.838 --> 37:40.716
We can officially drop
pretending to watch movies.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.223
Whoa!

37:56.149 --> 37:57.566
Baba!

37:58.068 --> 38:01.362
Uh, it's Otis's grandmother.
She's staying with us.

38:03.198 --> 38:07.159
Baba, it's really late.
Don't you want to go to bed?

38:10.747 --> 38:13.707
Uh, I'm gonna go
find some glasses.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.891
Now, this...
This is a good place.
Yes, it is.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.644
Another round?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.272
What's that?

38:40.068 --> 38:41.402
Medication time.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.243
Forget it.
Forget what?

38:52.956 --> 38:55.416
This one makes
me sleepy,

38:55.834 --> 38:58.085
this one
keeps me awake,

38:58.795 --> 39:02.381
and this one twists
up my stomach.
And I just can't...

39:02.465 --> 39:04.049
I can't do this anymore.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.342
Pops.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.761
I mean...

39:08.138 --> 39:12.599
I mean, what the hell
is a couple more months
if I'm too sick to enjoy it?

39:14.144 --> 39:15.477
I...

39:16.271 --> 39:18.522
I wanna go out
on my own terms,

39:23.111 --> 39:24.778
You ain't
going anywhere.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.205
You know, I'm thinking.
What?

39:35.874 --> 39:37.708
We're gonna throw a party!

39:37.792 --> 39:40.044
A party like
I used to throw.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.797
We're gonna throw
you a party.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.966
We're gonna throw
you a party.

39:47.844 --> 39:50.220
But you have got to
keep taking your pills.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.192
Fine.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.987
Deal.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.241
Trust me when I say I need
to do this near a toilet.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.327
TMI, pops. TMI.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.250
Don't go half-way
on this, son.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.669
I won't, Pop.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.175
I won't.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.014
Chief.
How's he doing?

40:34.682 --> 40:37.184
It's gonna take more than
cancer to take him out,
that much I know.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.023
Hey.
What's going on?

40:43.608 --> 40:45.234
I have some bad news.

40:46.027 --> 40:51.865
Unfortunately, uh, OFI
has decided not to pursue
Adrian Gish at this time.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.036
What?
It wasn't my decision.

40:57.705 --> 40:58.956
I'm sorry.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.249
But we found the guy.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.502
The storage unit dude
identified him and he
all but admitted it.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.671
All it does is tie Gish
to the storage unit.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.840
We can't prove it was
his or he was there.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.925
It was full of accelerants
and stuff about Shay.

41:10.009 --> 41:13.345
Believe me, I wish I could
give you a different answer,
but I can't.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.140
My boss has been
doing this for a long time,

41:16.224 --> 41:17.349
he knows what
cases will stick.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.018
This one won't.
At least not yet.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.645
What does
"not yet" mean?

41:21.729 --> 41:23.147
The case is still open.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.940
Gish is on our radar.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.733
We'll have
to wait and see.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.027
Yeah, until he
kills somebody again.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.737
Until he makes a mistake.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.073
Unbelievable.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.911
I'm sorry.

41:40.582 --> 41:41.832
What does this mean?

41:52.010 --> 41:55.262
Hey, it's Gabby.
I need your help.

41:55.430 --> 41:56.680
We all do.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.767
Sure, sis.
Whatever you need.
