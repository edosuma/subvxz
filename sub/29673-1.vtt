- Mason, turn that
shit down, man.

01:34.529 --> 01:37.009
- That shit is God's music, son,

01:37.053 --> 01:40.709
and it protects your
ungrateful millennial asses.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.233
And shut the damn
door next time!

01:56.159 --> 01:57.595
-  Cheap scare.

01:57.639 --> 01:58.727
- It counts.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.294
- No, no, it doesn't.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.732
Okay, frame up on
me, right here.

02:03.775 --> 02:06.169
Oh, what'd you think,
if I put my hand down?

02:06.213 --> 02:07.823
Is that too, like, relaxed?

02:07.866 --> 02:11.174
Or maybe the pole,
pole's bad for you, okay.

02:11.218 --> 02:14.438
Okay, okay, just frame up
over here then, we'll do this.

02:14.482 --> 02:15.570
You good?

02:15.613 --> 02:17.180
- Everything's faced.
- It's good.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.268
- Good, hair good, okay, cool.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.661
- Go.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.489
- In four, three, two.

02:23.491 --> 02:26.276
It all began here, 10 years ago.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.192
You don't need to
see what happened

02:29.236 --> 02:31.499
to feel its horrific residue.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.198
- Is he doing William
Shatner again?

02:35.242 --> 02:36.286
- Shh.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.082
- No, I'm not getting
anything over here.

02:50.126 --> 02:54.348
Let's head over to where
the event took place.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.272
Oh wow, it's definitely
a strong smell of bleach,

03:06.490 --> 03:10.233
no doubt from the cleanup
after the incident.

03:10.277 --> 03:14.846
The property landlord, after
years of vicious haunts,

03:16.021 --> 03:18.894
kept this building unrentable.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.287
Property landlord.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.030
The property landlord, after
years of vicious haunts,

03:25.074 --> 03:28.382
that kept this
building unrentable.

03:28.425 --> 03:33.430
Oh wow, okay, there's definitely
a temperature change, Raz.

03:34.126 --> 03:34.997
Did you feel that?

03:35.040 --> 03:35.911
- Yeah, like eight degrees.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.479
Got goosebumps and everything.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.003
- Okay, let's document
that, what time it happened.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.266
A decade ago, Benjamin Frisk,

03:43.310 --> 03:45.660
knowing that his
business was going under,

03:45.703 --> 03:49.272
knowing that everything he
had worked for was gone,

03:49.316 --> 03:51.274
walked into this office,

03:51.318 --> 03:54.408
his home away from
home for 20 years,

03:55.757 --> 04:00.109
put a loaded pistol under his
chin and pulled the trigger.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.027
- Hey, sorry I'm late, Steven.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.942
- That's okay, it's okay.

04:06.985 --> 04:10.554
Is there any signs, any
apparition signs, orbs?

04:10.598 --> 04:11.381
- Um.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.297
Nope.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.298
-  Regardless,

04:16.343 --> 04:19.607
this building is
insanely haunted,

04:19.649 --> 04:22.349
and Benjamin Frisk
is still here.

04:23.524 --> 04:26.614
Let's see if he's
got somethin' to say.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.141
Benjamin.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.188
Can you hear us?

04:38.800 --> 04:41.933
Do you like me
sitting in your chair?

04:43.457 --> 04:46.634
Do you have a message for
us from the other side?

04:46.677 --> 04:47.983
- Do you know

04:48.026 --> 04:50.464
if we're getting picked
up for a second season?

04:50.507 --> 04:53.380
- EDPs, electronic
voice phenomena,

04:54.555 --> 04:55.599
is one of the most effective
ways to communicate

04:55.643 --> 04:57.340
with he other side.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.343
Let's do a quick live session.

05:12.399 --> 05:16.011
What was that, was
that, was that a voice?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.318
It sounds--

05:19.406 --> 05:21.146
- Steven--
- Hang on, hang on.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.453
- Steven--
- Hold on, what?

05:23.497 --> 05:24.672
What?

05:24.715 --> 05:27.979
- It's your stomach,
it's growling.

05:28.023 --> 05:31.113
- It's my stomach, yeah it is.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.462
- Debunked.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.204
- Shit, it is my.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.553
It was my stomach.

05:36.597 --> 05:39.817
Um, okay, well, hard
evidence is exactly that.

05:40.862 --> 05:43.168
Hard to find, but either way,

05:43.212 --> 05:46.215
this building is
insanely haunted,

05:46.258 --> 05:47.477
and this night will go down

05:47.521 --> 05:48.826
as one of the
craziest nights ever

05:48.870 --> 05:51.307
for the Ghost Seeker's crew.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.441
- And, cut.

05:54.484 --> 05:57.095
- Ah, fuck me.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.489
- All right guys,
let's, let's wrap out.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.273
- I, I messed up the last part.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.187
Was that a good ending?

06:02.231 --> 06:03.450
- Yeah, it was, it was great.

06:03.493 --> 06:04.799
- I mean, okay, all right.

06:04.842 --> 06:08.368
I really thought this
was the spot, I mean.

06:11.458 --> 06:15.940
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.507
Mase, listen, when you
get back to the house,

06:17.551 --> 06:19.248
I want you to check everything,

06:19.291 --> 06:21.424
every angle we have, see
if you can find anything.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.512
- 10 four, boss.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.296
Hey, sorry, Steve.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.385
Next time, man.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.256
- Yeah, next time, right, here.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.911
- Mase here, go.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.043
-  I need to hit
a Starbucks like, now.

06:32.087 --> 06:36.526
- Is that the only thing
you wanna hit like, now?

06:36.570 --> 06:37.658
- Oh, Raz.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.575
- So, that location,
it was 200 bucks.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.054
- Oh good, good.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.143
- No, it was 200
bucks over budget.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.057
- What?

06:46.101 --> 06:47.885
- Yeah, you can pay me later.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.235
- Ah, fuck, okay,
thank you, Cris.

06:50.279 --> 06:53.891
- Look maybe it's time we
augment the show just a little.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.545
Add in some artificial
scares here and there,

06:55.589 --> 06:57.286
nothing too big--
- No, no, absolutely not.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.461
Then they win, no.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.723
- Who wins?

06:59.767 --> 07:01.421
- Look, doesn't
matter, all right?

07:01.464 --> 07:05.294
We are the only ghost show
that shows the real deal.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.384
What are you doing?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.125
- I was gonna get in there.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.518
- Oh, well, sorry.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.697
- Look, I get it, but
maybe there's a reason

07:16.740 --> 07:18.525
we're the only one.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.544
- If we ever hit any
real haunted houses,

08:21.588 --> 08:23.938
promise me you'll come say hi.

08:23.981 --> 08:24.765
Okay, Dad?

08:28.943 --> 08:30.205
- The most important
thing to remember

08:30.248 --> 08:31.554
when tracking spirits,

08:31.598 --> 08:33.513
is to know that those
on the other side,

08:33.556 --> 08:36.341
they just wanna be heard.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.561
There's really no
trick other than that.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.215
- Really?

08:40.258 --> 08:44.001
- The ghost trackers don't
choose the haunted house.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.089
It chooses us.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.656
- Yeah, and it also doesn't hurt

08:46.700 --> 08:50.355
to have that big-ass budget
for your location scout.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.618
-  What's there?

08:51.661 --> 08:52.967
- What the .

08:53.010 --> 08:55.578
- And the only secret
is to be patient.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.232
- And if that doesn't work?

08:57.275 --> 09:00.670
- And of course, a little
luck happens.

09:00.714 --> 09:01.671
- Luck, my ass.

09:01.715 --> 09:02.759
Schmucks.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.270
- Hey, you should
be asleep right now.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.576
- How much do we have
left in the budget

09:36.619 --> 09:38.665
for the final episode?

09:38.708 --> 09:41.406
- The usual, minus
the 200 owed to me.

09:41.450 --> 09:45.193
- Okay, we might need
to re-work it a little.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.847
All right, I wanna
hire somebody.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.065
- To do what?

09:48.109 --> 09:50.807
- To help the right
house find us.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.162
- Okay, what now?

09:59.163 --> 10:00.512
- Now, we wait.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.693
- Really?

10:06.736 --> 10:08.564
Go around me, dumbass!

10:10.087 --> 10:12.829
- Oh no wait, that's him.

10:15.005 --> 10:18.313
Thank you again for
meeting with us.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.184
You know, we don't have
the budget you guys have

10:20.228 --> 10:22.926
on Ghost Trackers, so we gotta
wear a couple hats, but--

10:22.970 --> 10:26.103
- Don't care, and this
meeting never happened.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.757
- Okay.
- 5,000.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.411
- What?
- Cris.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.587
- That's the entire budget
for our last episode.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.675
- Well, there's not gonna
be any more episodes

10:32.719 --> 10:34.329
if we don't nail the finale.

10:34.372 --> 10:35.896
- It doesn't matter, Steven,
if we can't afford to shoot it,

10:35.939 --> 10:37.811
then there won't
be a last episode.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.508
- Hey, Mom and Dad.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.901
We have a deal or not?

10:40.944 --> 10:43.207
- Yes, yes, we have a deal.

10:45.035 --> 10:45.775
Right?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.480
- Underneath your
seat, there's a laptop.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.047
-  Oh, okay.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.226
- Click on the file called
Fucking Scary Locations.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.839
- There's a password here, so--

11:05.882 --> 11:07.623
- Casper.
- What?

11:07.667 --> 11:08.711
- That's the password.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.626
- Like Casper The
Friendly Ghost?

11:10.670 --> 11:11.714
- No, just Casper.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.499
- No, just, just.
- Just Casper.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.680
- There's a file here
that says off limits.

11:20.723 --> 11:21.855
What is--

11:21.898 --> 11:23.030
- Oh, that's fucking
off limits to you,

11:23.073 --> 11:24.771
that's what that is.

11:24.814 --> 11:25.641
- Okay.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.521
- Whoa.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.786
- This is perfect, look at that.

11:39.829 --> 11:40.961
- Are you in level one?
- Yes.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.832
- I didn't say you
could go into level one.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.747
Level one and two are for
the Ghost Trackers team.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.618
You rummage through level three.

11:46.662 --> 11:47.881
- Oh.
- Okay.

11:47.924 --> 11:48.708
- Okay.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.721
- All right, all these
locations are dog shit.

12:01.764 --> 12:02.809
We hit three of 'em this season.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.071
- You don't like it,

12:04.114 --> 12:05.333
you can take your
cheap five K per diem

12:05.376 --> 12:07.552
and get the hell
outta my badass car.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.120
- It's not that
badass, it's a 2011.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.731
- It's a fine car, sir.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.995
Uh, okay, thank you, so
we'll just take this,

12:15.038 --> 12:18.346
and then we'll.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.653
And, we are good to go.

12:21.697 --> 12:22.567
Good, thank you, sir.

12:22.611 --> 12:23.220
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.265
- All right.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.142
- Ah, okay.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.753
Here, put this--
- All right,

12:33.796 --> 12:35.842
this folder better have the
holy shit of all haunted houses.

12:35.885 --> 12:36.712
- Okay.

12:45.547 --> 12:46.940
Oh, bingo!

12:46.983 --> 12:47.810
- Move over.
- Bingo, come on.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.247
Let's go, let's go.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.820
-  Well, it's
definitely photogenic.

12:57.864 --> 12:58.821
- Yeah.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
Uh, open this,
open this text doc.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.697
- Okay.
- Right here.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.787
- All right, the Dalva
House, Rockwell County,

13:07.830 --> 13:11.094
built in 1976, three
deaths in 1977.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.792
- Okay, decent body count.
- Right.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.619
- Okay.
- The father, Richard Dalva,

13:14.663 --> 13:18.449
killed wife Joanne and his
daughter Jill with a shotgun,

13:18.493 --> 13:21.888
Jesus, before blowing
his own brains out.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.933
- That is awesome, that.

13:25.979 --> 13:29.591
That's yeah, no you're right,
I'm sorry, that's fucked up.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.811
- One survivor, twin daughter
Fiona, whereabouts unknown,

13:31.854 --> 13:34.161
current owners unknown.

13:34.204 --> 13:38.948
It'd be nice to have a
picture of the family, huh?

13:38.992 --> 13:40.341
- What is that?

13:40.384 --> 13:41.255
Hang on, move, move, move,
watch out, watch out,

13:41.298 --> 13:42.517
watch out, watch out.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.867
It was right here, right
there, look at that.

13:52.353 --> 13:56.357
- I, I legit have goosebumps
for the first time.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.016
- Okay, we gotta get to this
before the Ghost Trackers do.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.192
- Yeah, yeah, all
right, I'll just,

14:05.235 --> 14:07.977
I'll figure out how to
pay everyone or something.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.239
-  Okay,
all right, good job.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.371
- I'm gonna let
'em know right now.

14:10.414 --> 14:11.154
- Okay.
- Good, all right.

14:11.198 --> 14:11.981
- Bye.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.038
We need beef jerky, it's a
road trip, we need beef jerky.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.562
Did we grab any
beef jerky for this?

14:27.605 --> 14:29.520
-  No, just
the granola bars.

14:29.564 --> 14:33.002
- Yeah, I just, protein's
kind of important to me.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.656
All right,

14:34.699 --> 14:36.832
are you a mesquite or just
straight up beef jerky?

14:36.876 --> 14:37.964
- It depends on what you get.
- Yeah.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.748
- A nice teriyaki turkey jerky.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.054
- Right.
- That's the way to go.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.577
-  Right,
turkey jerky, a bison.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.361
-  Yeah, you know
bison's a little gamey for me.

14:44.405 --> 14:45.754
-  Elk?

14:49.323 --> 14:50.541
-  ETA?

14:50.585 --> 14:51.934
- Well, it says
we're almost there,

14:51.978 --> 14:53.588
or we're completely lost.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.155
- No, I don't get lost.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.591
Lemme see that thing.

14:56.634 --> 14:57.897
- Okay, but look--
- Dog, dog!

14:57.940 --> 15:00.464
- Oh, shit!

15:01.988 --> 15:04.555
Oh, Jesus!
- Holy cripes!

15:04.599 --> 15:05.600
- Need help?

15:07.036 --> 15:10.605
- Um, yeah, we're looking
for the Dalva House.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.957
Do you know who the owner is,

15:15.001 --> 15:17.742
or I mean, you know
like who owns it?

15:17.786 --> 15:19.570
- No one owns the house.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.008
- What do you mean, it's like
public domain or something?

15:22.051 --> 15:24.967
- Doesn't belong to anyone.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.708
- Hey, is there a Starbucks
anywhere around here?

15:26.751 --> 15:27.970
- We're headed in
the right direction,

15:28.014 --> 15:29.537
is that what you're saying?

15:29.580 --> 15:31.365
- People belong to it.

15:35.108 --> 15:35.935
- What is?

15:37.110 --> 15:38.067
Does that mean?
- And, he's gone.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.678
- Thank you, Mr. Cryptic Indian.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.855
- Native American,
dude, come on, man.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.074
- Right, right.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.076
- That was, what?

15:47.120 --> 15:47.990
- Yeah.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.735
- FYI, my bladder
is about to explode.

15:53.778 --> 15:54.649
- Right, we should turn around

15:54.692 --> 15:56.694
before we get completely.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.000
- Bingo.

15:58.044 --> 16:02.004
- Yes my mama, that is
one hell of a location.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.879
- Holy shit, it is--
- Perfect.

16:13.102 --> 16:17.324
- Now, boys and girls, a
little divine protection.

- No, no, no, no, no.
- Why?

17:25.479 --> 17:28.482
- I wanna experience it
as the audience does.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.136
Okay?

17:30.179 --> 17:31.485
Trust me, trust me on this.

17:31.528 --> 17:32.616
-  Steven.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.053
- Guys, come on!

17:37.795 --> 17:39.841
Okay, let's set up mission
control in the living room,

17:39.884 --> 17:42.061
and I wanna place REM Pods
and a set of camcorders

17:42.104 --> 17:43.758
in the master bedroom upstairs.

17:43.801 --> 17:44.759
- Mm-hm.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.152
- The, the cellar,

17:46.195 --> 17:47.414
the kitchen, and
the daughter's room.

17:47.457 --> 17:48.197
- Got it.
- Thank you.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.677
-  Okay.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.593
- Hey, I really think we
should do a walk-through,

17:52.636 --> 17:53.898
just in case--
- No, no, no, no.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.118
I won't wanna have
to recreate anything.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.989
Okay, we do it
live, we do it live.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.079
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, okay.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.168
Guys, make sure the batteries
are all fully charged,

18:02.211 --> 18:04.126
and there's plenty
of card space, yeah?

18:04.170 --> 18:05.954
- You mean like usual?
- Copy.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.825
- Good.
- Are you sure?

18:07.869 --> 18:10.263
- Yes, yes, I got a good
feeling about this one.

18:10.306 --> 18:11.960
Okay, trust me.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.962
- I'll help set up the REM Pods.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.006
- Thank you.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.229
Hey Raz, let's scrub some B
roll while there's still light.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.840
-  Okay.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.218
- Bingo.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
- Hey Raz.
- Yeah.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.332
-  Come check this out.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.165
- What's that?
- Look at this.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.688
- Ah, this is dope.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.212
What is it?

19:30.256 --> 19:33.737
- Ah, I think it's like some
kind of a spiritual mandala

19:33.781 --> 19:34.912
or something.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.263
- Which is?

19:37.306 --> 19:40.440
- Uh well, you know,
it's basically--

19:42.137 --> 19:43.834
- You have no idea, do you?

19:43.878 --> 19:45.140
- No no no, I do, yeah, I know,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.228
I'm just trying to explain it--

19:46.272 --> 19:47.534
- Cool if you don't know.

19:47.577 --> 19:51.842
- No, it's, it's just
uh, let's just shoot it.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.931
- Right, yeah.
- Okay.

20:04.768 --> 20:08.946
In four, three, two, in
the middle of nowhere,

20:08.990 --> 20:12.036
forgotten by time,
lies a small property

20:12.080 --> 20:15.214
simply known as the Dalva House.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.085
It has been steeped in mystery

20:17.128 --> 20:19.435
under a dark cloud
of death and horror

20:19.479 --> 20:21.568
for nearly two generations.

20:21.611 --> 20:25.354
Its victims, a father, a
mother, and a daughter.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.964
Only the youngest
daughter escaped alive,

20:27.008 --> 20:28.879
whereabouts unknown.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.099
And tonight, the
Ghost Seekers crew

20:31.142 --> 20:32.448
will be the first
paranormal team

20:32.492 --> 20:35.799
to ever investigate
its untold secrets.

20:37.323 --> 20:42.110
Who knows what we might
find or what might find us.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.809
We've set up our command
center inside the living areas.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.247
Our audio visual tech Mason.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.858
- Hey.

20:50.901 --> 20:53.774
- He will be monitoring all
the static camcorder evidence

20:53.817 --> 20:55.079
that we get tonight.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.951
We also have our still
photographer, Jen.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.083
She will be taking
photos inside and out,

20:59.127 --> 21:02.130
looking for any
information on spirit orbs

21:02.173 --> 21:04.393
or apparition signs.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.221
We also have our producer, Cris.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.831
- Hey.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.311
-  She has deployed
REM Pods throughout the house.

21:09.355 --> 21:13.359
- That's right, REM Pods
use mini telescopic antennae

21:13.402 --> 21:15.578
to radiate their own
independent magnetic field,

21:15.622 --> 21:18.451
and this EM field can
be easily influenced

21:18.494 --> 21:22.368
by materials and objects
that conduct electricity.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.325
- What does that all mean?

21:23.369 --> 21:24.587
- Well, simply put,

21:24.631 --> 21:27.286
if a ghost comes
anywhere near a REM Pod,

21:27.329 --> 21:30.027
it will light up
like a stop sign.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.420
Shit, that doesn't make
any, Jesus, that's terrible.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.248
What's a better
adjective for that?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.641
- Uh, light up like Vegas.

21:34.684 --> 21:37.208
- Somethin' else, somethin'
better, come on, uh.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.340
-  Uh, a strip club?

21:38.384 --> 21:39.994
- No, uh.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.648
-  A goddamn
Christmas tree.

21:41.691 --> 21:45.608
- Yes, it will light up
like a Christmas tree.

21:45.652 --> 21:48.176
And now, it is time for
the Ghost Seekers crew

21:48.219 --> 21:50.961
to start their investigation.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.312
Let's get our ghost on, ready?

21:53.355 --> 21:54.487
Go time.
- Woo!

22:16.639 --> 22:19.990
- Okay, well usually we
like to start things off

22:20.034 --> 22:23.298
by walking around and
opening ourselves up

22:23.342 --> 22:26.562
to see what we can
experience physically.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.431
I'm not really
getting anything here,

23:09.475 --> 23:10.258
do you wanna head upstairs?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.477
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:02.528 --> 24:06.314
Okay, let's do
a quick live session.

24:06.357 --> 24:09.578
All right, everybody
quiet, don't move, please.

24:14.365 --> 24:18.805
Is there anyone that would
like to communicate with us?

24:23.853 --> 24:26.856
Are there any
children in this room?

24:49.139 --> 24:50.010
- Patience.

24:52.229 --> 24:53.013
Patience.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.979
- Mayday, mayday,
viewership dropping.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.204
-  Hang on guys, hang on.

25:10.247 --> 25:13.773
Mase, are you seein'
anything on your end?

25:13.816 --> 25:15.339
- Negative, boss.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.692
- Let's head to the cellar.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.069
Raz, I can't see
shit with this thing.

25:49.112 --> 25:51.201
Will you give me
the big dog, please?

25:51.245 --> 25:52.246
-  Yep.

26:02.169 --> 26:07.174
- If there are any spirits in
here, please give us a sign.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.307
- We just wanna
communicate with you.

26:13.702 --> 26:14.747
- Guys.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.532
Check this out.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.707
-  What?

26:20.753 --> 26:22.319
- What are those?

26:35.768 --> 26:37.987
- Those are shotgun holes.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.469
Holy shit guys, you
know what this is?

26:41.512 --> 26:44.690
This is where Mr. Dalva lined
up his family and shot 'em,

26:44.733 --> 26:45.604
right here.

26:47.214 --> 26:50.043
This is perfect, let's whip
out the SP7 Spearbox, please.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.785
Let's put it it right
here in the middle.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.308
So, okay, what this device does,

26:54.351 --> 26:57.224
it scans through multiple
radio frequencies every second,

26:57.267 --> 26:59.313
generating white noise.

26:59.356 --> 27:02.359
And that gives the entities
the energy they need

27:02.403 --> 27:04.666
to communicate with us.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.408
So let's see what
they gotta say.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.410
Okay.

27:12.587 --> 27:14.589
Mr. Dalva, are you here?

27:18.375 --> 27:21.944
Why did you kill your
wife and your daughter

27:21.988 --> 27:23.642
and then yourself?

27:25.731 --> 27:29.865
You can't hide, Mr. Dalva,
we know you're here.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.175
You know, sometimes you gotta,

27:35.218 --> 27:37.003
you gotta nudge 'em a little,

27:37.046 --> 27:39.658
you know, piss 'em off.

27:39.701 --> 27:40.484
Hey!

27:43.226 --> 27:44.750
I know you can hear me.

27:44.793 --> 27:48.014
We're not leaving
until you answer us.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.023
♪ Oh

27:57.066 --> 28:00.461
♪ Well we shall live on

28:26.443 --> 28:30.447
- I know you wanna
communicate with us, come on.

28:31.753 --> 28:32.841
- What time is it?

28:32.885 --> 28:34.277
- It doesn't matter
what time it is.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.322
-  What time is it?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.671
- Just after midnight.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.064
- Shit.
- It's not working.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.718
- No no, come on, we're close.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.023
- It's not happening, Steven.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.851
- God damn it, I
know you're here,

28:42.895 --> 28:44.331
I can sense your presence.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.636
- Yeah, you can
sense the presence,

28:45.680 --> 28:48.988
but none of the
equipment can, so.

28:49.031 --> 28:51.991
-  Fuck, it should
be right here, I know, it's--

28:52.034 --> 28:53.775
- Raz, stand down.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.821
-  It should be right
here, I, I don't understand.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.083
- Hey, look.

28:57.126 --> 28:58.606
Maybe it's time we
borrowed just a little

28:58.649 --> 28:59.999
from the Ghost Trackers guys.

29:00.042 --> 29:03.219
You know, bump into
some shadowy figures.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.744
- No, we are not
hacks, Cris, okay?

29:05.787 --> 29:08.007
As soon as we do
that, we let them win.

29:08.050 --> 29:10.879
- You keep saying
that, who's winning,

29:10.923 --> 29:12.446
what are you talking about?

29:12.489 --> 29:13.882
- It doesn't matter, all right?

29:13.926 --> 29:15.797
I didn't get into this to
hoax people, all right?

29:15.841 --> 29:16.842
End of story.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.234
- Neither did I.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.236
I wanna believe in the
afterlife so bad it hurts,

29:20.280 --> 29:22.717
but we have got to
do something here.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.197
- I mean come on, think about
what you're saying, right?

29:24.240 --> 29:25.851
Think about what
the crew would think

29:25.894 --> 29:27.156
if we did somethin' like that.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.505
- All right, how many
of you are cool with us

29:28.549 --> 29:32.248
augmenting the show with
a few artificial scares?

29:38.515 --> 29:40.517
Look, we did our best, Steven.

29:40.561 --> 29:43.129
I know we can do this, trust me.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.436
Okay?

29:49.178 --> 29:53.008
-  Okay, yeah, well.

29:54.488 --> 29:55.837
Well, let's get
this shit over with.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.970
- Yeah.
- Yes!

29:58.013 --> 30:00.189
-  Hell to the yes.

30:17.511 --> 30:20.601
- This room is where the
father, Richard Dalva,

30:20.644 --> 30:24.344
must've plotted his
horrendous killing spree.

30:26.955 --> 30:27.869
- Oh, fuck.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.179
REM Pods are all lit up,

30:33.222 --> 30:35.790
what the hell's goin'
on up there, guys?

30:35.834 --> 30:40.577
- Okay, I'm definitely
feeling a cold spot over here.

30:40.621 --> 30:44.886
Over here guys, it's definitely
a little cold right here.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.540
Yeah, I'm definitely
feelin' it right here.

30:50.022 --> 30:50.805
Shit!

30:51.980 --> 30:53.025
- Look, look, look!

30:53.068 --> 30:54.504
It caught a big ass orb.

30:54.548 --> 30:57.856
- Oh my god, that's
incredible, that is incredible.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.293
This is the most
proof we've ever had

31:00.336 --> 31:02.861
on the Ghost Seekers crew.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.210
-  And, cut!

31:04.253 --> 31:05.167
- Oh!
- Woo!

31:06.342 --> 31:07.430
- We got the lights
up on that shit!

31:12.783 --> 31:14.089
- That says done, son!

31:14.133 --> 31:16.483
- Okay, what comes next,
these are so much fun.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.006
- I vote we go straight
for the cellar.

31:18.050 --> 31:19.878
- All right, how long are
we gonna set for the cellar?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.009
- How scary you want it?

31:21.053 --> 31:23.316
- How about a 10
on the ghost meter?

31:23.359 --> 31:24.099
- A couple hours.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.579
- What about a seven?

31:25.622 --> 31:26.928
- Less than 30.
- Let's do it.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.887
-  Let's do it, yeah.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.586
- Come on.

31:32.629 --> 31:35.284
- I'm just gonna go
10 to 100 real quick.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.895
- Okay.
- Outside.

31:52.388 --> 31:55.739
Thanks for nothin'.

32:00.353 --> 32:01.006
Fuck me.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.413
- Steven.
- Ooh, hey!

32:17.457 --> 32:19.154
- Hey, I didn't
mean to scare you.

32:19.198 --> 32:20.982
- Hey.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.984
- I'm just comin' out here
to make sure you're okay.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.116
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:24.159 --> 32:25.291
- Look, I know it sucks,

32:25.334 --> 32:27.336
but once we get
renewed for season two,

32:27.380 --> 32:30.992
we'll be able to continue
hunting actual ghosts.

32:31.036 --> 32:35.605
- Yeah, no, I'm good,
I give up.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.042
-  You give up?

32:37.085 --> 32:40.001
What do you mean, you give up?

32:40.045 --> 32:41.611
- It's a long story.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.657
- Okay, I wanna hear it.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.008
- Really?

32:47.052 --> 32:49.837
- Yeah, I wanna
hear the long story.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.974
- Okay, well it all
started with a nickname

32:56.017 --> 32:57.845
that I got in middle school,

32:57.888 --> 32:59.803
and it followed
me to high school,

32:59.847 --> 33:02.850
and it was all because
of show and tell.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.984
I had this neighbor,
Walter, he was a older guy,

33:06.027 --> 33:08.334
and he was always
really nice to me,

33:08.377 --> 33:12.077
so he passed away, and
I went to his funeral,

33:13.165 --> 33:14.383
and when I was there,

33:14.427 --> 33:15.994
and they were lowering
him into the ground,

33:16.037 --> 33:20.041
I looked up at his wife,
and she was lookin' at me,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.437
and Walter was sittin'
right next to her,

33:24.480 --> 33:26.178
smiling at me.
- Seriously?

33:26.221 --> 33:27.048
- Yeah.

33:28.136 --> 33:30.747
Yeah, it was broad daylight too,

33:30.791 --> 33:32.140
and it was just for a second,

33:32.184 --> 33:35.622
and then he kinda
just disappeared,

33:35.665 --> 33:39.452
but it blew me away, and
I was really excited,

33:40.975 --> 33:42.368
and I went to school the
next day for show and tell,

33:42.411 --> 33:46.067
and I didn't have anything
to show, you know?

33:47.590 --> 33:50.419
I didn't have any proof for
the story I was telling,

33:50.463 --> 33:55.033
so my teacher gave me shit,
and everyone made fun of me,

33:56.643 --> 34:00.777
and they all started callin'
me Stevie See Dead People.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.521
That's--
- That's super messed up.

34:05.565 --> 34:06.827
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.306
- I'm not even sure
why kids that age

34:08.350 --> 34:10.612
were watching The
Sixth Sense, but--

34:10.657 --> 34:12.659
- Right.
- It stuck, and,

34:14.268 --> 34:19.056
and yeah, I just wanted to
prove those little shits wrong,

34:20.145 --> 34:21.623
you know?

34:21.668 --> 34:25.063
I wanted them to
know I wasn't lying.

34:25.106 --> 34:30.068
But I guess the joke's still
on me, right?

34:34.114 --> 34:34.898
- Hey.

34:38.163 --> 34:41.079
I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.094
What?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.536
Where did that arrow come from?

35:03.579 --> 35:05.451
- From me peeing on it?

35:07.148 --> 35:10.195
Hey Mase, I'm directly
behind the house,

35:10.238 --> 35:11.196
can you come down here?

35:11.239 --> 35:12.545
Bring a shovel.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.168
- I'm not hittin' anything.

35:27.212 --> 35:30.302
Are you sure the arrow
means literally down?

35:30.345 --> 35:34.132
It could mean go straight
back to the house.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.134
- It's not just a stone.

35:38.310 --> 35:39.833
- That's a tombstone.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.575
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, I'm done.

35:42.618 --> 35:43.924
- What do you mean--

35:43.967 --> 35:45.186
- No, no, no, my,
my job description

35:45.230 --> 35:47.057
does not include grave digger.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.711
My grandma would've had my ass

35:48.755 --> 35:51.540
if she seen me out
here disrespecting
the dead like that.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.063
Y'all wanna see
what's down there?

35:53.107 --> 35:53.977
Have at it.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.284
- Here, I got it.

36:16.478 --> 36:17.262
- Oh.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.134
I better go get
the gospels goin'

36:20.178 --> 36:23.224
'cause that is definitely
either a dead fetus

36:23.268 --> 36:24.747
or a shrunken head.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.014
Whoa, man!

36:38.544 --> 36:39.545
- Holy shit.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.600
-  What language is that?

36:51.644 --> 36:54.342
- I think it's Native American.

36:54.386 --> 36:55.256
-  That looks
like directions

36:55.300 --> 36:58.564
to the place you don't wanna go.

36:58.607 --> 37:01.175
- Why do you say that?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.917
- You see that spiral?
- Yeah.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.354
- Those people around it,
they're not dancing around that,

37:06.398 --> 37:08.922
they're gettin'
sucked down into it.

37:08.965 --> 37:13.622
That is some fucked up
voodoo shit right there, man.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.278
- Wait, Steven, Steven!

37:23.284 --> 37:24.416
- Are you filming my ass?

37:24.459 --> 37:25.852
-  Yeah, why?

37:27.549 --> 37:28.289
- Hey guys.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.943
- Hey, check it out.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.423
- Oh yeah, yeah, we don't
need this bullshit anymore.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.337
- Yeah.
- Dude.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.642
- We don't know what that is.

37:33.686 --> 37:35.296
- Or who the hell
buried it there.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.777
- It's a spell or an incantation
that the Dalvas left us

37:37.820 --> 37:39.039
for us to find.

37:39.082 --> 37:40.301
- You don't know that.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.216
- I do know that a sane
man built this house

37:42.260 --> 37:43.435
and then lost his shit

37:43.478 --> 37:45.132
after he eventually
came across this stuff,

37:45.175 --> 37:46.264
and I also know that
if there's anything

37:46.307 --> 37:48.178
certifiably supernatural
about this shit,

37:48.222 --> 37:51.791
we're about to have the
most legit ghost show ever.

37:51.834 --> 37:55.447
Mase, will you please
turn on the sensors.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.666
- So we're crossin' that line?

37:57.710 --> 38:00.147
This is gonna happen?
- Yes.

38:00.190 --> 38:03.672
Yeah, I'm sorry, okay,
just please trust me.

38:05.239 --> 38:07.154
Please, trust me, okay?

38:09.330 --> 38:10.897
-  Fine.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.073
I'll just be that guy that
no one pays attention to

38:13.116 --> 38:16.337
right before all the
shit hits the fan.

38:16.381 --> 38:19.340
- Steven.
- Can I get the tape, please?

38:19.384 --> 38:20.385
- Can I ask what's going on?

38:20.428 --> 38:22.038
- Please do.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.605
- Yeah, so we found this grave
next to a stone in the woods,

38:23.649 --> 38:25.738
had some stuff in it, and
now Steven's playing with it.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.395
- Okay, I'll set up a
shot around the stairs.

38:30.438 --> 38:32.484
- Yeah, I'll get my camera.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.358
- Okay, can you
hear me all right?

38:37.402 --> 38:38.533
-  Yeah, I hear you okay.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.580
But what you're
doin' is not okay.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.451
- Okay, ready and framed up?

38:43.495 --> 38:45.323
- Yeah, are you fucking kidding?

38:45.366 --> 38:47.237
- Okay, good?
- Yeah.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.065
- In four, three, two.

38:51.111 --> 38:54.244
And we are back in the
epicenter of the vicious murders

38:54.288 --> 38:58.292
where Richard Dalva nearly
murdered his entire family

38:58.336 --> 39:00.860
and then committed suicide.

39:00.903 --> 39:05.386
His reasons for doing this
unknown until tonight.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.041
-  And, we're
doin' Shatner again.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.825
- Just yards away
from the Dalva House,

39:09.869 --> 39:14.264
the Ghost Seekers crew unearthed
something extraordinary,

39:14.308 --> 39:18.399
and then we'll cut to the B
roll of the unmarked grave.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.054
An unmarked grave that
has kept in secrets

39:21.097 --> 39:24.492
since possibly the
night of the murders.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.976
Following the ancient
Native American instructions

39:30.019 --> 39:32.674
that are on the back
of this fur hide,

39:32.718 --> 39:34.197
we're going to try

39:34.241 --> 39:36.374
and attempt to communicate
with the spirits.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.464
That have been
trapped in this house.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.424
All right, let's
switch to infrared.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.599
-  Okay.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.386
- Don't try this at home, kids.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.680
And can I get a lighter?

40:30.079 --> 40:34.562
- Is the door between the
living and the dead opening?

40:34.606 --> 40:36.521
- Yeah, it should be.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.480
-  Now what?

40:40.742 --> 40:43.092
- Now we just, we wait.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.650
- Okay, so plan B, Steven?

41:23.306 --> 41:26.832
-  Maybe
there's too many of us?

41:26.875 --> 41:29.878
- Do spirits get stage fright?

41:33.186 --> 41:36.885
- Let's head upstairs,
Raz, stay down here, okay?

41:36.929 --> 41:38.539
You're good?

41:38.583 --> 41:40.672
- Yeah, no, just leave me here

41:40.715 --> 41:44.850
with the scary-ass taped
off spiral thingy, yeah.

41:45.764 --> 41:46.504
Great.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.334
- Raz.
- Yeah, copy.

41:54.903 --> 41:57.123
- How's it comin'?

41:57.166 --> 41:58.516
- Good.

41:58.559 --> 42:01.519
You know, just tryin'
to be good ghost bait.

42:05.392 --> 42:06.219
Okay.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.831
Uh, you guys see that, right?

42:11.746 --> 42:13.618
- We definitely saw it.

42:14.575 --> 42:16.534
- You tryin' to
communicate with me?

42:16.577 --> 42:20.146
- Or maybe his flashlight
just needs new batteries?

42:20.189 --> 42:21.887
- Try provoking it?

42:21.930 --> 42:23.628
- Is that all you can do, huh?

42:23.671 --> 42:25.325
Come on!

42:25.368 --> 42:29.285
It's a waste of your time,
gettin' hungry down here.

42:35.901 --> 42:36.684
Guys?

42:40.645 --> 42:43.125
Um, definitely feeling
something down here.

42:43.169 --> 42:44.997
There's an electrical
charge in the air,

42:45.040 --> 42:47.608
definitely an electrical charge.

42:50.916 --> 42:52.265
- Raz.

42:52.308 --> 42:54.397
Raz, can you come
into frame, buddy?

42:54.441 --> 42:55.921
We can't see you.

42:55.964 --> 42:58.140
Talk to me Raz,

42:58.184 --> 42:59.098
can you hear me?

42:59.141 --> 43:00.403
You got somethin' down there?

43:00.447 --> 43:01.622
- Maybe we should
go check on him.

43:01.666 --> 43:02.971
- No, no, I got him, not yet.

43:03.015 --> 43:05.887
- He's just messin'
with us, right?

43:08.890 --> 43:10.196
- What's happening?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,

43:10.239 --> 43:11.458
stop, hang on.

43:15.723 --> 43:18.596
- Uh, he's not
messin' with us, guys.

43:20.162 --> 43:22.121
There's definitely some
kind of interference here.

43:22.164 --> 43:24.689
- Raz?

43:24.732 --> 43:25.951
- Where is he?

43:27.561 --> 43:29.607
- Raz, we can't see you.

43:29.650 --> 43:30.738
Cris, Cris.

43:38.528 --> 43:40.182
- Raz, where are you?

43:41.706 --> 43:42.707
-  Raz?

43:47.712 --> 43:49.017
- Is there anything on there?

43:49.061 --> 43:50.018
- Nothin' just static
like on the monitors.

43:50.062 --> 43:52.368
- Where the hell did he go?

43:54.457 --> 43:55.850
- Wait a second.

43:58.113 --> 43:58.853
Wow.

44:08.689 --> 44:10.778
Okay, all right,

44:10.822 --> 44:13.041
okay, very funny, ha ha ha.

44:13.085 --> 44:14.826
We're back to plan B, right?

44:14.869 --> 44:17.219
- I don't think this is plan B.

44:17.263 --> 44:19.178
- Look, he's gotta
be here somewhere.

44:19.221 --> 44:21.746
We go back, we check
all the monitors.

44:21.789 --> 44:24.705
- Okay, all right,
fine, come on, let's go.

44:39.633 --> 44:41.722
- Oh.

44:41.766 --> 44:43.724
Oh.
- Damn, Raz.

44:43.768 --> 44:46.858
All right, let's go
get him, come on.

44:54.779 --> 44:56.128
- Steven, something's wrong.

45:20.935 --> 45:21.936
-  Jen.

45:26.898 --> 45:30.858
- All right you asshole,
that wasn't funny.

45:30.902 --> 45:31.946
Raz?

45:33.078 --> 45:33.861
Raz?

46:26.435 --> 46:30.004
- Not gonna get you in
this bullshit, Mason.

46:49.284 --> 46:52.418
Uh, hey guys, somethin' outside

46:52.461 --> 46:54.550
just made me come
dangerously close

46:54.594 --> 46:56.857
to crappin' my favorite pants.

46:56.901 --> 46:57.858
- Is it Raz?

46:57.902 --> 46:59.164
- I don't know, maybe,

46:59.207 --> 47:00.861
but I don't have eyes
on Jen right now either.

47:00.905 --> 47:03.124
-  Jesus
Christ, come on, guys.

47:03.168 --> 47:05.561
-  I'll check
outside, bring 'em back in.

47:05.605 --> 47:07.476
- Okay, copy that,
it's unbelievable.

47:07.520 --> 47:12.525
- Steven, something's not
right, we're both feeling it.

47:13.178 --> 47:15.833
-  Come on.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.625
- All right guys,
enough of this shit.

47:25.668 --> 47:26.887
You're not back
here in 30 seconds,

47:26.931 --> 47:30.108
I'm packin' up my van
and leavin' your asses.

47:34.677 --> 47:36.114
Fuckin' millenials.

47:38.856 --> 47:39.857
- We should've discussed it.

47:39.900 --> 47:40.901
- What?
- The ritual.

47:40.945 --> 47:42.163
You rushed everyone into this,

47:42.207 --> 47:43.948
if anything happened to
them, this is on you.

47:43.991 --> 47:45.950
- Okay, I'm sorry, I made
a team leader decision.

47:45.993 --> 47:47.560
- A leader?

47:47.603 --> 47:49.257
I'm your producer and your
partner, and when we--

47:49.301 --> 47:51.390
- Listen it's my face
in front of the camera

47:51.433 --> 47:54.393
tryin' to pull actual
spirits outta my ass, Cris.

47:54.436 --> 47:56.482
- Okay fine, next
time you and your face

47:56.525 --> 47:59.224
wanna screw with fire, you
can just do it by yourself.

47:59.267 --> 48:00.051
- Fine.

48:14.239 --> 48:15.153
Do you feel that?

48:15.196 --> 48:16.981
- Yeah, it's freezing.

48:37.915 --> 48:38.654
You didn't say he was--

48:38.698 --> 48:39.786
- Dead, yeah.

48:43.007 --> 48:44.660
Okay here, take this.

48:45.835 --> 48:46.967
Take it, got it?
- Yeah.

48:47.011 --> 48:50.753
- It's recording,
that's good, yeah, okay.

48:55.149 --> 48:57.543
Okay, I don't wanna rush this.

49:01.677 --> 49:02.461
Go.
- Okay.

49:04.724 --> 49:05.507
Hello?

49:06.421 --> 49:08.032
-  Help.

49:08.075 --> 49:09.163
- Who's this?

49:12.079 --> 49:13.124
Who?

49:15.735 --> 49:20.218
- What the fuck?

49:20.261 --> 49:21.045
Hello?

49:23.177 --> 49:23.961
Hello?

49:26.050 --> 49:27.834
What, what are you talking
about, there's nobody there.

49:27.877 --> 49:30.010
- It's impossible, I
just heard somebody,

49:30.054 --> 49:31.403
and he was asking for help.

49:31.446 --> 49:32.230
- Guys.

49:33.492 --> 49:34.797
Guys, you gotta get
over here right now,

49:34.841 --> 49:36.408
you gotta see this.

49:36.451 --> 49:38.671
Mase, do you copy?

49:38.714 --> 49:39.498
Mason?

49:43.371 --> 49:44.155
- Mason!

49:49.638 --> 49:50.726
Mason, Mason?

49:52.946 --> 49:54.165
- Shit.
- Mason, are you okay?

49:54.208 --> 49:56.036
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Mason, Steven, help me.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.646
- Hey, come on, hey.

49:59.779 --> 50:01.041
- What, what the
fuck, what is that?

50:01.085 --> 50:03.043
-  Oh god.

50:03.087 --> 50:04.088
- Is it, that's not real, right?

50:04.131 --> 50:06.829
This is, hey, is he dead?

50:06.873 --> 50:09.136
Mase, Mase, Mase, hey.

50:09.180 --> 50:11.008
Is he dead, this
isn't real right?

50:11.051 --> 50:12.226
- Mason, are you okay?
- This isn't real,

50:12.270 --> 50:13.184
this isn't happening.
- Steven, help me.

50:13.227 --> 50:14.315
- This isn't real.

50:14.359 --> 50:15.142
Mase!

50:19.103 --> 50:20.626
Mase, Mase.
- Steven!

50:25.196 --> 50:27.024
- What are you doing?

50:27.067 --> 50:28.068
Jen?

50:30.418 --> 50:31.637
- Jen.
- Hey Jen, go, go, go, go, go!

51:00.796 --> 51:01.536
- Jen?

51:28.955 --> 51:30.261
-  Come on,
let's go, let's go!

51:30.304 --> 51:33.481
- Steven, where are my keys?
- Oh, shit.

51:37.224 --> 51:38.617
Come on, let's go!

51:40.097 --> 51:42.447
- Steven, she's coming!
- What?

51:44.884 --> 51:45.624
Holy shit.

51:48.148 --> 51:48.888
Oh shit.

51:50.194 --> 51:51.369
Lock your door, lock
your door, come on.

51:51.412 --> 51:54.241
Shit!

52:15.784 --> 52:16.568
- Get in!

52:18.961 --> 52:20.354
Move your asses!

52:20.398 --> 52:21.181
Get in!

52:33.367 --> 52:34.542
-  Shit.

52:38.764 --> 52:39.982
- Who are you?

52:40.026 --> 52:40.940
- We're paranormal
investigators.

52:40.983 --> 52:41.984
- Ghost hunters?
- Who are you?

52:42.028 --> 52:43.334
- Fiona.

52:43.377 --> 52:47.251
- Fiona, like the Fiona,
from the Dalva House?

52:47.294 --> 52:48.600
- Okay, you were
breaking and entering,

52:48.643 --> 52:49.949
what the hell did
you do back there?

52:49.992 --> 52:50.732
- We didn't do anything.

52:50.776 --> 52:52.256
- Yes we did, Steven.

52:52.299 --> 52:55.868
- Okay, okay, okay, we were
investigating, and then--

52:55.911 --> 52:58.131
- And then we found a box
buried next to a headstone.

52:58.175 --> 53:01.221
- And you just said the
incantation because why not?

53:01.265 --> 53:02.353
- So you knew about this?

53:02.396 --> 53:03.745
Why didn't you destroy it?

53:03.789 --> 53:05.356
- I tried, I tried to burn it,

53:05.399 --> 53:07.358
but it just can't be
destroyed, so I buried it.

53:07.401 --> 53:09.186
- Something happened to our
friends, our crew members--

53:09.229 --> 53:13.581
- Okay, they're no longer
your crew, nor your friends.

53:16.105 --> 53:17.846
-  Where are we going?

53:17.890 --> 53:19.500
- To the only person who
might be able to undo

53:19.544 --> 53:22.242
what your
investigation has done.

53:32.644 --> 53:33.993
I'm sorry, does that hurt?

53:34.036 --> 53:35.212
- Yeah.
- Good.

53:35.255 --> 53:36.822
- Ah!

53:36.865 --> 53:39.172
- So when's this only person
who can help us getting here?

53:39.216 --> 53:42.741
- Told you, the house
belongs to no one.

53:42.784 --> 53:44.264
You belong to it.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.666
- This is my brother, Douglas,
the one who warned you.

53:54.709 --> 53:57.277
The only one who can help us.

53:57.321 --> 53:58.278
- Thank you.

54:01.455 --> 54:04.023
- They found the
box, it's open again.

54:04.066 --> 54:05.416
- What's--
- What box?

54:05.459 --> 54:06.721
- Yeah, what did we open?

54:06.765 --> 54:08.288
- It's the portal
to the darkness.

54:08.332 --> 54:11.378
It possesses you and
then devours your soul.

54:11.422 --> 54:13.293
- Okay, in our defense,

54:13.337 --> 54:15.600
we were just doing
our jobs, all right?

54:15.643 --> 54:17.558
We're not the only people
out there, you know,

54:17.602 --> 54:19.256
chasing ghosts, all right?

54:19.299 --> 54:22.346
- You didn't chase a ghost.

54:22.389 --> 54:23.912
You chased a demon.

54:25.392 --> 54:28.265
- Well who writes down
instructions to release a demon?

54:28.308 --> 54:29.309
- My ancestors.

54:30.832 --> 54:34.096
They made a pact with
Camazotz, the dark force,

54:34.140 --> 54:38.362
to stop a genociding of our
tribes two centuries ago.

54:39.885 --> 54:44.455
It was our protector, but now
it takes lives for itself.

54:47.719 --> 54:48.937
- And that's what
happened to my father.

54:48.981 --> 54:51.984
He reopened the
portal 42 years ago.

54:53.420 --> 54:55.379
I had come home from a
sleepover early that night,

54:55.422 --> 54:58.382
and when I got home, I
heard the first shot.

55:00.427 --> 55:02.211
I knew it was coming
from the cellar,

55:02.255 --> 55:05.432
so I raced down the steps,
and when I got there,

55:05.476 --> 55:06.651
I saw my father.

55:07.782 --> 55:09.393
He was holding my sister
down with his foot

55:09.436 --> 55:11.264
while he reloaded his shotgun.

55:11.308 --> 55:14.789
He told me that he had to
do this to save our family.

55:16.487 --> 55:17.618
He snapped the barrel closed,

55:17.662 --> 55:19.316
and I grabbed for
the butt of the gun.

55:19.359 --> 55:22.797
He tried to pry my
fingers off the trigger.

55:22.841 --> 55:26.410
And I shot him in
the face.

55:26.453 --> 55:28.368
I ran over to my sister,

55:28.412 --> 55:30.370
but he managed to
get off another shot,

55:30.414 --> 55:33.547
and my sister passed
away in my arms.

55:34.766 --> 55:38.378
Douglas's family,
they took me in.

55:38.422 --> 55:40.380
- We never meant to harm anyone.

55:40.424 --> 55:42.382
- Yeah, neither did my dad.

55:42.426 --> 55:43.688
But unlike you geniuses,

55:43.731 --> 55:47.213
he wasn't warned to
stay away beforehand.

55:48.997 --> 55:51.348
- I must prepare now.

55:51.391 --> 55:52.697
- I'm gonna go with you.

55:52.740 --> 55:54.655
- It's not safe for
you, it remembers you.

55:54.699 --> 55:55.917
- But you're gonna need my help.

55:55.961 --> 55:57.049
- What about our friends?

55:57.092 --> 55:58.616
- It's too late for them.

55:58.659 --> 55:59.747
- What?
- No.

55:59.791 --> 56:01.358
No no, there's gotta be a way.

56:01.401 --> 56:03.403
- Yeah, I mean, can't we
just close the portal,

56:03.447 --> 56:05.405
and they won't be
possessed anymore?

56:05.449 --> 56:07.189
- It doesn't work that way.

56:07.233 --> 56:08.800
- Well, how does it work?

56:08.843 --> 56:10.845
- It's not gonna just stand by
and let us close the portal.

56:10.889 --> 56:12.456
It's gonna do
everything to stop us.

56:12.499 --> 56:14.153
And if your friends
are in the way,

56:14.196 --> 56:15.763
we're just gonna
have to take them out

56:15.807 --> 56:17.025
like I did my father.

56:17.069 --> 56:18.026
- Cris, what if we
protect you from them

56:18.070 --> 56:19.550
until you close it?

56:19.593 --> 56:21.203
- Right.

56:21.247 --> 56:22.727
- We'll only end up having
to take you out as well.

56:22.770 --> 56:25.338
- It is their destiny, but
whatever may happen tonight,

56:25.382 --> 56:28.559
it is their spiritual
journey as well.

56:33.694 --> 56:36.001
- Go outside, meet
me at the car.

56:36.044 --> 56:38.003
- Okay, so wait,
what's the plan?

56:38.046 --> 56:40.571
- To not raise the body count.

56:45.967 --> 56:46.925
-  Do you have service?

56:46.968 --> 56:48.187
- No.
- What are you doing?

56:48.230 --> 56:49.449
- I'm deleting all
my photos and videos.

56:49.493 --> 56:50.407
You should do the same thing.

56:50.450 --> 56:51.669
- Why?

56:51.712 --> 56:53.758
- All right, you frame
tight, I'll frame wide.

56:53.801 --> 56:55.499
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

56:55.542 --> 56:57.544
- Steven, the
investigation is over.

56:57.588 --> 56:59.154
This show, it's over.

56:59.198 --> 57:00.460
- What are you talking about?

57:00.504 --> 57:02.114
This is just the beginning.

57:02.157 --> 57:03.420
Nothing like this has ever
been documented before.

57:03.463 --> 57:05.509
This is uncharted territory.

57:05.552 --> 57:07.467
- What?
- Cris, come on.

57:07.511 --> 57:08.947
You want this, too.

57:08.990 --> 57:10.557
- Are you insane?

57:10.601 --> 57:12.646
I wanted to do this so that
maybe we could talk to someone

57:12.690 --> 57:14.474
on the other side, not all this.

57:14.518 --> 57:16.215
People are dying, thanks to us.

57:16.258 --> 57:17.912
- Hey, I know that, I know.

57:17.956 --> 57:19.566
But they would've
died for nothing

57:19.610 --> 57:21.350
if we don't finish this.

57:21.394 --> 57:23.309
- This isn't about
getting back at some kids

57:23.352 --> 57:24.832
who made fun of you
for seeing a ghost.

57:24.876 --> 57:26.704
This is about saving Jen
and getting Raz back,

57:26.747 --> 57:28.357
end of story.

57:28.401 --> 57:30.359
- Yeah, well, I think it's
the end of the first season.

57:30.403 --> 57:33.188
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

57:35.669 --> 57:38.237
-  Okay.

57:40.282 --> 57:41.980
Shouldn't we wait till
daylight, you know?

57:42.023 --> 57:43.503
When it's brighter?

57:44.722 --> 57:46.332
- The longer we wait,
the less chance we have

57:46.375 --> 57:48.943
of closing the portal
and saving your friends.

57:48.987 --> 57:52.425
- Where did you
perform the ritual?

57:52.469 --> 57:53.992
- Uh, in the cellar.

57:54.035 --> 57:58.518
By the far wall, you know,
where the shotgun holes are.

58:00.433 --> 58:04.306
- You must know, it's not only
that our lives are at stake,

58:04.350 --> 58:06.004
but so are our souls.

58:21.628 --> 58:23.064
- Where's Mason?

58:24.326 --> 58:25.676
- His body's gone.

58:26.894 --> 58:30.594
- Hey, don't believe
what you see.

58:30.637 --> 58:33.771
Keep your guard up, they
know that we're here.

58:33.814 --> 58:34.598
Ready?

58:56.924 --> 59:00.580
- Stay together, we're
stronger as a group.

59:44.668 --> 59:45.582
- Hey, really?

59:46.844 --> 59:49.673
He just said we're
stronger together.

01:00:17.831 --> 01:00:20.791
- One of your friends is near.

01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:22.227
I feel him.

01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:34.979
We must act quickly.

01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:10.667
- What's happening?

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:14.192
- Raz?
- Raz?

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:18.500
Raz?

01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:39.478
- Holy shit.

01:01:39.521 --> 01:01:40.827
Hey, Raz.
- Raz?

01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:42.176
- Are you okay?
- Can you hear me?

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.612
- Hey, come here buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:44.788
Hey, look at me.

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:47.312
- Okay, let's go.

01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:49.444
- Go grab a sheet.
- Okay.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:58.889
What have I done?

01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:02.936
- My god.
- Raz.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.894
- It's okay.

01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:06.157
- Oh god, what have I done?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.724
Is he gonna be okay?

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:08.899
- We gotta get him outta here.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:10.683
- Come on, let's go.
- Get him up.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:11.945
- Come on, buddy.

01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:14.774
Okay.

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.733
We gotcha.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:02:24.218 --> 01:02:25.829
- Don't answer it.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.796
-  Help me!

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.319
- How the hell did
that get there?

01:02:38.363 --> 01:02:40.887
- Same voice I heard earlier.

01:02:42.976 --> 01:02:44.108
-  Help!

01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:49.200
Help!

01:02:50.636 --> 01:02:51.855
Sweetie, help!

01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:55.772
- Dad, it's, Dad?

01:02:56.947 --> 01:03:00.254
- Help Daddy.
- Dad, is that you?

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:01.342
-  Cris.

01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:08.567
- Dad, can you hear me?

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.830
- Help me, Cris.
- What?

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.266
-  Help me.

01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:19.099
- It's not your father,
sweetie, it's the darkness.

01:03:19.143 --> 01:03:19.883
-  Help me.

01:03:19.926 --> 01:03:20.884
- Turn it off.

01:03:20.927 --> 01:03:22.929
- I can't turn it off!

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:32.809
-  It's using
your mind against you.

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:36.116
- Steven!

01:03:45.952 --> 01:03:47.301
Okay, I'm okay.

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:50.739
- Okay, let's get
him to the car.

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:53.003
- Come on, come on, let's go.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:04.101
- Mom?

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:09.715
-  Okay, go.

01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:11.891
- Why didn't you save me?

01:04:11.935 --> 01:04:13.284
- No.

01:04:13.327 --> 01:04:15.112
- You let us die.

01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.983
- I didn't, Mom.

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:18.593
No!

01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:21.205
- You let us die.

01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:25.078
Now it's your turn.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.691
- Why'd you shoot Daddy, angel?

01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:35.654
- We can't leave
them alone in there.

01:04:35.697 --> 01:04:37.525
- Close your mind to it.

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:41.878
- Douglas.
- They blocked it.

01:04:41.921 --> 01:04:44.228
- Oh god, it's so strong now.

01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:45.316
It's so strong.

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.709
- Let's finish this.

01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:02.811
- Go!
- Ah!

01:05:02.855 --> 01:05:05.118
- All right, come on, let's go.

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:16.608
Oh shit.

01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.218
It's Jen.
- Jen, Jen?

01:05:25.704 --> 01:05:27.880
- Leave this child now.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.882
You do not belong here.

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:32.841
You're no longer
needed in this world.

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:41.807
- Ah, it's okay, come on.
- Get her back.

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:46.855
- Douglas, it is not working.

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:49.119
- He won't leave until
we offer an exchange.

01:05:49.162 --> 01:05:50.468
- An exchange for what?

01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:52.339
- For returning your friend.

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:53.993
He demands another
life in his place.

01:05:54.037 --> 01:05:55.299
- Well tell him there's
no fuckin' exchanges.

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:58.693
- Too late.

01:05:58.737 --> 01:06:00.652
It's already marked its soul.

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.959
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, not her, not her.

01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:04.482
- A soul for a soul.

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:06.310
- Tell this man to stop,
make it stop, Douglas.

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:09.748
This is my fault, alright? I
opened the portal, this is my
fault

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:11.706
- It wants her for her faith.

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:13.447
And love is stronger than faith.

01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:15.188
Love is stronger than faith.

01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:16.494
- What, what?

01:06:16.537 --> 01:06:18.278
- I love you, Cris.

01:06:19.192 --> 01:06:21.978
I love you, too.

01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:22.979
- Do something.

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:24.981
- Only you can save him.

01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:28.723
You must release the
soul from the body.

01:06:28.767 --> 01:06:31.770
- It's the only to save
him from the portal, Cris.

01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:34.164
I had to do it with my father.

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:44.913
- Okay.

01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:52.051
I can't.

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:54.358
- I love you

01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:55.315
- No, no!

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:14.639
- Oh, god.

01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:37.662
Good.

01:07:51.415 --> 01:07:55.897
- Hey, you guys seen a camera
crew anywhere around here,

01:07:55.941 --> 01:07:56.811
and my hat?

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:01.033
Also, I think I might need

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.862
a little hydrogen
peroxide for this.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.929
- Your father looks
like a kind man.

01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:28.756
- He was.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.935
- Mine was, too,
until that night.

01:08:37.287 --> 01:08:38.157
I miss him.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.725
I miss 'em all.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:46.513
But they're out
there waiting for me.

01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:51.170
So is your father.

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:53.694
- And Steven.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.523
- Yeah.
