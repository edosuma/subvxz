I had to a mother.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.853
- Would any of you be saying
any of this

10:21.855 --> 10:23.121
If the cupcakes were
from supermart?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.156
- Do they even
have a bakery anymore?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.758
- They do.
It's awful!

10:26.760 --> 10:29.094
And it's getting worse
every day.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.730
- So it really is
just about the cupcakes.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.231
- Wow, you're right.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.333
It is just about the cupcakes.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.204
- So we're all agreed
no one touches those cupcakes?

10:40.106 --> 10:42.007
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.309
Packer can go to hell.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.080
- Thank you for coming
to my funeral.

10:49.082 --> 10:52.083
As I gaze
at life's big sunset,

10:52.085 --> 10:55.353
I can't help but wonder
where it all went wrong.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.990
You've all disappointed me
greatly.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.726
Fanny, a single mama
in the city.

11:01.728 --> 11:02.861
- Thank you.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.063
- Jeb, a street pusher.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.331
- After I left the army,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.867
I bought a nine-acre
worm farm

11:08.869 --> 11:10.168
From a californian.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.138
Turns out,

11:13.140 --> 11:16.107
"worm" means something else
out there,

11:16.109 --> 11:20.812
And I am now
in the business of...

11:20.814 --> 11:23.114
Pain management.

11:23.116 --> 11:27.085
Or the smoking
of pain management.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.988
- I can't stand the fact
that jeb is a pot farmer.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.057
He could've grown anything.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.992
Anything in the world.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.362
He used to talk about
growing a peanut-grape hybrid.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.699
One plant, one sandwich.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.200
- We can't just sit by

11:42.202 --> 11:45.336
And watch our family farm
disappear.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.138
So here are my terms.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.074
Dwight, fanny, jeb.

11:49.076 --> 11:55.113
If you come back home,
I will leave you my farm.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.982
So there you have it.
- Is she crazy?

11:57.984 --> 11:59.718
Dwight?
- Dwight? Buddy?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.019
- No, no, no.
- Snap out of it.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.187
[snapping fingers]
dwight!

12:04.223 --> 12:04.355

12:05.858 --> 12:07.125
Let's run
aunt shirley's farm.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.426
I'm in.
Boom!

12:08.428 --> 12:09.828
- No, no, no.
I'm not moving back here.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.196
Are you crazy?
- Of course you are.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.364
- Look, I don't wanna be mean
or, like, insulting.

12:13.366 --> 12:18.336
But, dwight, it's just that
farm life lacks a certain...

12:18.338 --> 12:20.872
Sort of sophistication...
- Oh, my god.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.073
- That cami and I
are drawn to.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.475
And...
[sighs]

12:23.477 --> 12:26.344
I don't know,
the men are just--[sighs]

12:26.346 --> 12:30.348
It's almost like there's a--
a willing ignorance.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.417
Yes, I--
thank you for asking me.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.153
I actually have written
a little bit of poetry.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.790
That's crazy.
And I was recently published.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.358
Which is just--

12:40.360 --> 12:41.926
Maybe I have--
yep, I do.

Like a fart.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.246

13:01.248 --> 13:02.781
Let's take
a couple of nights

13:02.783 --> 13:05.049
And stay here and think
about aunt shirley's offer.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.417
- Couple of nights
couldn't hurt.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.319
- Oh, somehow I think
a couple of nights could hurt.

5, 4, 3, 2.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.291
Get ready to say yes.
One!

13:13.293 --> 13:17.228
Yes!
- Absolutely!

13:17.230 --> 13:19.931
Growing up with dwight
and mose was not easy.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.834
Uh, dwight was obviously
the cool one,

13:22.836 --> 13:24.869
And mose was the visionary,

13:24.871 --> 13:28.406
Which left me
to be the comedian.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.841

13:56.469 --> 13:58.469
To get people to care about
