00:22.582 --> 00:23.749
<i>Mickey!</i>

to spare. Ha!

01:50.333 --> 01:51.749
What?

01:52.457 --> 01:53.541
What?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.499
Wha...
Hmm.

02:00.749 --> 02:02.041
I don't have time to talk, goofy!

02:02.041 --> 02:03.666
I'm late meeting minnie
and I've lost my ears!

02:03.666 --> 02:04.790
Have you seen 'em? What?

02:04.790 --> 02:06.041

02:06.041 --> 02:07.208
<i>This hockey game is nuts.</i>

02:07.499 --> 02:09.166
<i>There's three pucks on the ice.</i>

02:09.166 --> 02:10.666
Did you say three pucks on the ice?

02:10.666 --> 02:12.666
<i>That's right.
Three pucks on the ice.</i>

02:12.666 --> 02:14.083
It's my ears.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.083
Huh. I gotta go. Thanks
for lending me your ears.

02:17.041 --> 02:18.291
What?

02:47.582 --> 02:50.249
<i>Mickey mouse wins it for the home team!</i>

02:50.249 --> 02:52.790
Mickey mouse!

02:54.083 --> 02:55.291
Minnie!

02:56.832 --> 02:58.499
Hey, look, goofy.
I found my ears.

02:58.957 --> 03:00.083
What?

03:05.832 --> 03:08.208
'Scuse me, pardon me...
'Scuse me, here I am!

03:08.208 --> 03:09.666
Oh, Mickey! You made it!

03:09.666 --> 03:12.000
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

03:12.832 --> 03:14.291
By the way, what're we watching?

03:14.291 --> 03:15.291
The opera.
