00:11.476 --> 00:13.477
I got to meet a gang of people
at my mother's saloon.

00:13.512 --> 00:15.112
You want to come? It's a
party for me, honest.

00:15.147 --> 00:17.014
- I'd love to.
- Really? You mean it?

00:17.049 --> 00:18.015
Why? Have you changed your mind?

00:18.050 --> 00:19.583
No, no, I mean, I-I know

00:19.618 --> 00:21.285
it isn't every day that a
glorified ziegfeld girl

00:21.320 --> 00:22.553
like me asks you out.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.148
Man: Thank you, Rachel,
that was lovely.

00:25.557 --> 00:26.524
That's it?

00:26.558 --> 00:28.793
All I needed to see.

00:35.601 --> 00:37.001
It was a pleasure
reading with you.

00:37.035 --> 00:38.703
And I loved you as Lancelot.

00:38.737 --> 00:41.005
I saw the revival
of <i>Camelot</i> three times...

00:41.039 --> 00:42.340
four, if you
include the bootleg

00:42.374 --> 00:44.308
that my friend Kurt has, so...

00:44.343 --> 00:45.276
(Clicks tongue)

00:45.310 --> 00:47.311
Thanks.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.501
Well, Paolo,
you're our Tony winner.

01:10.535 --> 01:12.036
What did you think?

01:12.070 --> 01:13.437
Aw, she's charming.

01:13.472 --> 01:15.640
And she certainly looks
right for the part.

01:15.674 --> 01:17.275
I just fear that
she's too young,

01:17.309 --> 01:18.276
you know, too green?

01:18.310 --> 01:19.810
That was my concern as well.

01:19.845 --> 01:21.312
Lack of experience.

01:21.346 --> 01:23.848
She'd be a discovery,
but it's such a risk.

01:23.882 --> 01:25.917
Paolo: I mean, that
part, it's a mountain.

01:25.951 --> 01:27.718
At her age, I never
could have pulled it off.

01:27.753 --> 01:30.021
Now, where did we leave it
with Claire Danes' people?

01:30.055 --> 01:32.056

(The Beatles' "Help!" playing)

04:15.921 --> 04:17.588
(All whooping, cheering)

04:22.427 --> 04:23.988
I don't think
we've ever spent two weeks

04:23.996 --> 04:25.029
on an assignment, Mr. Shue.

04:25.063 --> 04:26.230
Hey, the Beatles are so epic

04:26.265 --> 04:27.798
that we need two weeks
to do them justice.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.901
This week is all about the
early years of the Beatles,

04:29.935 --> 04:31.969
when all they had was
a belief in each other

04:32.004 --> 04:34.172
and a belief that together
they could do anything.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.326
(Groans) The school year seems
like it's never ending,

04:36.341 --> 04:37.742
and now we're wasting
two whole weeks

04:37.776 --> 04:39.577
on a band from the 1940s?

04:39.611 --> 04:41.812
Seriously, can anyone
still relate to the Beatles?

04:41.847 --> 04:42.880
Pretty much the entire world.

04:42.915 --> 04:43.948
Yeah, I can
definitely still relate.

04:43.982 --> 04:44.749
Kitty:
Why?

04:44.783 --> 04:45.783
Were the Beatles dyslexic

04:45.818 --> 04:46.784
and cat-fished

04:46.818 --> 04:47.885
by transsexuals?

04:47.920 --> 04:49.754
And you wonder
why everybody hates you.

04:49.788 --> 04:50.955
Marley:
When George Harrison was a kid,

04:50.989 --> 04:52.890
he was made fun of 'cause
his dad was the bus driver.

04:52.925 --> 04:54.392
Jake: John Lennon's dad
wasn't even around.

04:54.426 --> 04:56.527
He walked out of John's
life when he was five.

04:56.562 --> 04:59.397
I don't really know the Beatles;
I'm a little on the black side.

04:59.431 --> 05:00.765
Artie: And Ringo starr was
a sickly little kid,

05:00.799 --> 05:03.868
which probably means
he was sitting down a lot.

05:03.902 --> 05:05.736
Will:
And they decided to form a band.

05:05.771 --> 05:07.071
Which changed the world.

05:07.105 --> 05:08.339
Now, you guys are
really gonna have

05:08.373 --> 05:09.440
to challenge yourselves
this week.

05:09.474 --> 05:10.708
Bring your a-plus games.

05:10.742 --> 05:11.909
Perform these classic songs

05:11.944 --> 05:13.311
in new and exciting ways.

05:13.345 --> 05:14.946
If we can push ourselves
to a whole new level,

05:14.980 --> 05:16.481
like the Beatles did constantly,

05:16.515 --> 05:18.749
we can win back-to-back
national championships

05:18.784 --> 05:20.718
and form
a new directions! Dynasty.

05:20.752 --> 05:23.721
(All whooping, cheering)

05:23.755 --> 05:25.022
(School bell ringing)

05:25.057 --> 05:26.858
All right, see you
guys tomorrow.

05:26.892 --> 05:28.025
Tina.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.561
(Clears throat)

05:30.596 --> 05:32.296
And speaking of...

05:32.331 --> 05:34.265
Your chariot awaits.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.702
Okay, we're moving
slower than Jonah hill

05:37.736 --> 05:39.270
trying to get out
of the bathtub.

05:39.304 --> 05:41.072
And everyone is staring.

05:41.106 --> 05:43.341
Yeah, at our hotness.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.609
You know, I never thanked you

05:44.643 --> 05:46.377
for making me come
clean with my mom.

05:46.411 --> 05:48.846
I'm going to the Brooklyn
film academy because of you.

05:48.881 --> 05:52.650
And to thank you, I want
to take you to Breadstix.

05:52.684 --> 05:55.286
Besides, we both know
that the raw, animal attraction

05:55.320 --> 05:56.521
between us is undeniable.

05:56.555 --> 05:58.289
Did you really just say that?

05:58.323 --> 05:59.957
No wonder Tina
broke up with you.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.026
And Brittany and sugar and
the girl in the wheelchair

06:02.060 --> 06:03.594
with the disturbingly
massive boobs.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.596
And ps, I hate Breadstix.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.266
Okay, well, there's
a carnival in town.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.367
That could be fun.

06:09.401 --> 06:10.635
Yeah, if you want
to trust your life

06:10.669 --> 06:12.570
to toothless carnies
who operate the rides.

06:12.604 --> 06:15.306
Okay.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.340
So is that a yes or a no?

Hey, Kitty-Kat.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.841
Girl, you crashed
into me head-on.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.776
I swear, you could have
paralyzed me.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.376
My bad.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.446
I'm Bree, spelled with two es.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.614
Not like the funky cheese.

08:36.648 --> 08:37.648
Artie.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.549
You two were so cute,
all snuggly

08:39.585 --> 08:41.419
and cuddled up
in that teeny, tiny car.

08:41.453 --> 08:42.820
Are you two going out?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.087
Nope. Just friends.

08:44.121 --> 08:45.456
Well, you should.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.725
You look really sweet together.
I hope you don't mind.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.461
I took a couple of pictures
and instagrammed them.

08:50.496 --> 08:53.431
Anyway, have fun.

08:53.465 --> 08:54.832
She seems nice.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.001
She's a stone-cold bitch
and she's out to destroy me.

08:57.035 --> 08:58.336
(Phone buzzing)

09:02.508 --> 09:04.509
Okay.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.179
You and me...

09:08.213 --> 09:09.247
We're more than "just friends."

09:09.281 --> 09:11.616
What if we go out...

09:11.650 --> 09:13.718
But we do it on the down-low?

09:13.752 --> 09:15.987
You know, like secretly
gay conservatives do.

09:16.021 --> 09:17.889
It'll make everything
all fun and forbidden.

09:17.923 --> 09:19.991
So you like me...

09:20.025 --> 09:22.293
But you don't want
to be seen with me.

09:23.328 --> 09:25.463
I need status at this school
to survive.

09:26.598 --> 09:28.433
Yeah, right.

09:38.644 --> 09:41.579
(Car horns honking nearby)

09:41.613 --> 09:44.582
(Siren blaring in distance)

09:44.616 --> 09:46.617
(Whistle blows nearby)

09:47.753 --> 09:49.120
This was a mistake.

09:49.154 --> 09:50.721
Okay, no, Rachel, you
are not backing out.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.523
I basically had to show
Gunther my left side boob

09:52.558 --> 09:54.659
to get you this job.

09:59.431 --> 10:00.631
Here, put this on.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.433
Look, santana,
while I really appreciate

10:02.468 --> 10:04.469
you freely prostituting
yourself for me,

10:04.503 --> 10:06.070
that was before my
world came crashing down

10:06.105 --> 10:09.006
and I totally blew my
<i>funny girl</i> chemistry read.

10:09.708 --> 10:11.008
You're late, Lopez!

10:11.043 --> 10:12.677
Yes, yes, I know,
sorry, Gunther.

10:12.711 --> 10:13.678
Is that her?

10:13.712 --> 10:14.746
Yes, this is her.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.047
Rachel, that's Gunther.

10:16.081 --> 10:18.216
Don't tell him if
you're Jewish or black.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.650
Listen.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.786
You said it yourself
a bazillion times.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.354
You want to get to Broadway,
you have to pay your dues.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.489
(Shrieks)

10:24.523 --> 10:26.591
Well, I mean,
I guess that's true.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.160
Patti Lupone was a waitress,
<i>Pre-Evita.</i>

10:29.194 --> 10:31.062
And, you know, this is
the spotlight diner,

10:31.096 --> 10:33.231
and it's on Broadway, and
waiters get to sing and dance.

10:33.265 --> 10:34.665
Plus my dads would pay
my rent till I died,

10:34.700 --> 10:36.234
and I don't want that anymore
because I want to be

10:36.268 --> 10:39.137
grown up and living
and making it on my own.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.539
We're basically
working actresses.

10:44.409 --> 10:46.778
Blaine: So, you excited
to go back to school?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.413
Kurt:
Yeah, fashion week is coming up.

10:48.447 --> 10:50.481
But this farewell picnic's
been perfect, though.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.851
What's the story
with this New York guy?

10:53.886 --> 10:56.254
There's no story.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.323
He was nice and people liked
the idea of us as a couple,

10:59.358 --> 11:02.060
but never got serious.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.428
All right,
let me break it down for you.

11:03.462 --> 11:04.696
All right,
the last time we tried dating,

11:04.730 --> 11:06.297
and I was in New York
and you were here,

11:06.331 --> 11:07.398
you cheated on me.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.433
All right, unacceptable.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.467
We've been through this.

11:09.501 --> 11:10.902
I thought you were done with me.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.270
I thought it was over.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.272
I thought I was completely
out of the picture in your life.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.073
Look at me in the eyes
when I say this.

11:16.108 --> 11:17.442
I'm being beyond serious.

11:17.476 --> 11:20.178
I will never, ever...

11:20.212 --> 11:23.815
Ever cheat on you again.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.185
I'm gonna need you to sign one
of those non-cheating contracts.

11:27.219 --> 11:29.253
You know, you can get one
on Oprah's web site.

11:29.288 --> 11:30.755
I will sign whatever you want.

11:30.789 --> 11:34.158
Just please say that you and I
can be boyfriends again.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.994
What?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.063
I don't know
if relationships actually work.

11:39.098 --> 11:42.166
I mean, weren't Bethenny and
Jason supposed to be forever?

11:42.201 --> 11:43.968
For every Bethenny and Jason,

11:44.003 --> 11:45.970
there is a Will and a Jada,

11:46.004 --> 11:48.439
and a-a Kurt and a Goldie.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.475
Come on, can we at least

11:50.509 --> 11:52.977
just give it a try?

11:53.012 --> 11:55.313
But I'm Goldie, of course.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.281
Of course you are.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.817
I-I can't believe
we're gonna do this again.

11:59.852 --> 12:02.387
I was hoping you would say yes.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.855
Actually I was kind
of planning on it,

12:03.889 --> 12:05.623
which I why I sort of, um,
put something together

12:05.657 --> 12:07.458
to try to convince you
to stay a little longer.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.393
Uh, no, no, no,
that's not gonna happen, okay?

12:09.428 --> 12:10.628
I-I'm not sitting down

12:10.662 --> 12:11.662
and listening to you
sing to me anymore.

12:11.697 --> 12:13.665
Okay.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.967
Which is why
<i>I</i> prepared something.

I'm truly humbled.

We're in a pinch here, coach,

all of your help,

and cleaning up
our tarnished reputation,

22:31.459 --> 22:33.160
I think we'd all be happy
to help.

22:33.194 --> 22:36.563
Uh, Trent, we said
I'd do the talking.

22:36.597 --> 22:38.231
All in favor of helping Blaine?

22:38.266 --> 22:39.266
All:
Aye!

22:40.468 --> 22:42.702
(All whooping)

22:47.509 --> 22:49.643
Artie, we've been
friends for a long time,

22:49.678 --> 22:52.179
so I'm just gonna ask,
are you and Kitty an item?

22:52.214 --> 22:54.648
What? No.

22:54.683 --> 22:57.284
I mean, yes.
I mean, maybe.

22:57.319 --> 22:59.386
I'm unclear. It's sort of this
secret affair

22:59.421 --> 23:00.988
we're not really supposed
to talk about.

23:01.022 --> 23:02.957
Yes! I knew it!
Why? Why can't you?

23:02.991 --> 23:04.191
Lower your voice, Tina.

23:05.293 --> 23:08.229
Because Kitty's uncomfortable

23:08.263 --> 23:09.763
with people knowing
she's dating...

23:09.798 --> 23:10.965
Someone who wears glasses

23:10.999 --> 23:13.067
who's in a wheelchair
who's in glee club?

23:13.101 --> 23:14.435
Where's your self-respect?

23:14.469 --> 23:17.037
Tina, I know you're trying
to help.

23:17.072 --> 23:18.472
Like, at least I think you are.

23:18.506 --> 23:23.802
So I'm gonna say thank you.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.939
(School bell ringing)

23:29.508 --> 23:33.344
All right, got your burger
and your salad. Enjoy.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.782
Oh, my God, you're not gonna
believe this text

23:37.817 --> 23:39.117
I just got from Blaine.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.286
You're not gonna believe
who's sitting in my section.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.959
Mmm, I'll take this.

23:47.993 --> 23:50.862
Okay, so we have one Roxie

23:50.896 --> 23:54.099
and one Velma,
a side of Billy Flynns.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.635
Yes, it's me,
and, yes, it's awkward,

23:57.670 --> 23:58.837
but I don't care,

23:58.871 --> 24:01.272
because I am a professional.

24:01.307 --> 24:02.674
Even when people are calling me

24:02.708 --> 24:04.075
"too young" or-or "green,"

24:04.110 --> 24:05.744
which, for your information,
I'm not.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.945
I am a...
Am a star.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.647
Yes, I am a star.
Rachel, look,

24:09.682 --> 24:11.516
it's not personal.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.918
Everyone thinks they're a star,
even when they're not.

24:13.953 --> 24:14.953
Look around.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.722
They all want
to be on Broadway.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.491
Look, I'm not saying
you're not a star, Rachel.

24:19.525 --> 24:23.395
Just saying
I'm not sure just yet.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.598
I understand.

24:28.134 --> 24:31.369
I guess I'll just have
to prove it to you, then.

We have to go home.

we need to do.

26:39.224 --> 26:40.557
I don't know what
you're so nervous about.

26:40.592 --> 26:41.592
She's not going after
the cheerios!

26:41.626 --> 26:42.960
It's the glee club she hates.

26:42.994 --> 26:44.161
Bitch, please.

26:44.195 --> 26:46.430
Sue Sylvester's had it out
for me since day one.

26:46.464 --> 26:47.798
I took her job, remember?

26:47.832 --> 26:50.501
I just know she's dug up
all kind of dirt on me.

26:50.535 --> 26:51.902
What kind of dirt?

26:51.936 --> 26:54.505
Number one, this bronze
damn olympic medal

26:54.539 --> 26:57.107
in individual synchronized
swimming I won

26:57.142 --> 26:59.443
at them Chinese Olympics
may have been

26:59.477 --> 27:02.880
the result of some performance-
enhancing drugs and weed.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.681
Number two, I may have
perpetrated a buttload

27:04.716 --> 27:05.849
of credit card fraud.

27:05.884 --> 27:08.685
An old lady in Florida
may have paid for my condo,

27:08.720 --> 27:12.055
and I might have just
flat-out stole my lexus

27:12.090 --> 27:15.125
off a used car lot.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.794
Well, then, yeah,
we're both screwed.

27:17.829 --> 27:19.830
Sue's gonna take out
the glee club

27:19.864 --> 27:21.498
and the cheerios!
In one fell swoop.

27:21.533 --> 27:24.168
Oh, now why on earth would I do
something like that, Buttchin?

27:24.202 --> 27:26.003
Because you're vindictive
and petty.

27:26.037 --> 27:28.305
Oh, well, you're forgetting
one thing, William.

27:28.339 --> 27:31.542
I have been given the post of
interim principal at this school.

27:31.576 --> 27:33.510
A post that will be made
permanent

27:33.544 --> 27:36.814
at the end of the year
if all goes according to plan,

27:36.848 --> 27:39.383
allowing me to demolish
this office down to the studs,

27:39.417 --> 27:43.520
ridding it once and for all
of the deep, ethnic musk

27:43.555 --> 27:44.655
that is Figgins' hallmark.

27:44.689 --> 27:46.490
Now, in order to achieve that,

27:46.524 --> 27:48.892
I need the programs
at this school to be successful.

27:48.927 --> 27:53.130
I need the teams
at McKinley high to be winners.

27:53.164 --> 27:55.299
Wait, wait,
y-you're not firing us?

27:55.333 --> 27:57.568
Not if you win a national
championship, I'm not.

27:57.602 --> 28:00.337
However, if you fail to win at
Nationals, I will fire you.

28:00.371 --> 28:02.406
You'll be forced to build
creepy relationships

28:02.440 --> 28:03.874
with teenagers on your own time.

28:03.908 --> 28:06.176
And you, you'll have to go back

28:06.211 --> 28:08.712
to being a full-time spokesmodel
for Billy Dee Williams'

28:08.746 --> 28:09.913
yellow hair helmets

28:09.948 --> 28:12.182
for women who couldn't possibly
be less blonde.

28:12.217 --> 28:13.550
Congratulations.

28:13.585 --> 28:16.720
You're on my watch now,
which means...

28:16.754 --> 28:19.756
You're winners.

28:22.160 --> 28:26.363
Okay, guys, week one of
our Beatles fest has been epic.

28:26.397 --> 28:28.799
I think we've really unpacked
what made the fab four

28:28.833 --> 28:30.267
such a instant sensation,

28:30.301 --> 28:32.703
but now I want to turn to their
oft-ignored middle period.

28:32.737 --> 28:34.071
Mr. Shue, would you say

28:34.105 --> 28:35.906
that the early Beatles looked
out for each other

28:35.940 --> 28:37.941
even when they didn't want
to be looked out for?

28:37.976 --> 28:39.109
Oh, God, no.

28:39.144 --> 28:41.812
If I understand your question,
Tina,

28:41.846 --> 28:44.281
yes, the early Beatles
always had each other's backs.

28:44.315 --> 28:45.716
In that case, I'm sorry, Artie,
but this

28:45.750 --> 28:47.017
is for your own good.

28:47.051 --> 28:50.420
Everyone, Kitty and Artie
are dating,

28:50.455 --> 28:51.788
but Kitty's making Artie hide it

28:51.823 --> 28:53.257
because she's embarrassed
by him,

28:53.291 --> 28:54.892
and I think
that's emotional abuse.

28:54.926 --> 28:58.195
Artie is a great guy, and
he deserves to be loved openly

28:58.229 --> 28:59.590
and proudly
and without conditions.

29:01.499 --> 29:02.866
For once we agree.

29:03.735 --> 29:07.971
It's true.
Arthur and I are dating.

29:08.006 --> 29:09.640
We are? Officially?

29:09.674 --> 29:11.775
And for the record... and not
that it's anyone's business,

29:11.810 --> 29:14.411
especially not yours,
Tina Cohen-agitator...

29:14.446 --> 29:16.313
I did want to keep it hush-hush.

29:16.347 --> 29:17.414
Because you were ashamed.

29:17.448 --> 29:20.918
Yes, memoirs of a lame geisha,
because I occupy

29:20.952 --> 29:22.619
a certain place
in the McKinley hierarchy,

29:22.654 --> 29:26.590
and you all occupy a different,
lesser place in that hierarchy,

29:26.624 --> 29:28.192
and before exploding
said hierarchy

29:28.226 --> 29:30.394
by jumping up and down
on Oprah's couch,

29:30.428 --> 29:34.031
declaring my undying love for
someone who is, let's face it,

29:34.065 --> 29:36.500
not my usual body type...

29:37.569 --> 29:38.836
I wanted to be sure.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.103
Of what?

29:43.374 --> 29:46.009
That I really, really liked him.

29:47.445 --> 29:49.112
And that I would be willing
to risk

29:49.147 --> 29:52.416
not just my social standing
but also getting hurt

29:52.450 --> 29:54.918
by letting him wheel
into my heart.

29:54.953 --> 29:58.021
And even though I know
he's getting ready to graduate,

29:58.056 --> 30:01.825
and we're probably just
as doomed as every other sad,

30:01.860 --> 30:04.528
broken, backwards relationship
that's ever started

30:04.562 --> 30:06.463
in this Jesus-and love-forsaken
choir room...

30:06.498 --> 30:09.166
Kurt and I <i>will</i> have
a happy ending.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.368
But I do like you, Artie.
You make me laugh,

30:11.402 --> 30:13.504
and not just with those stupid
YouTube fail videos

30:13.538 --> 30:14.638
you're always showing me.

30:19.611 --> 30:23.747
Look, asking you to keep
our stuff private wasn't cool,

30:23.782 --> 30:24.848
and I'm sorry.

30:24.883 --> 30:27.518
It's okay, Kitty.

30:27.552 --> 30:33.257
But, um, as far as, like,
updating my Facebook status...

30:33.291 --> 30:38.862
Yes, we are officially,
publicly, shockingly

30:38.897 --> 30:40.856
a thing.

30:40.899 --> 30:44.668
(All cheer)

30:48.506 --> 30:49.786
You guys...
(School bell ringing)

30:52.252 --> 30:55.177
Do any of you know
why I call you in here?

30:55.204 --> 30:58.406
Uh, is it to get prepared
in case

30:58.441 --> 31:00.208
the North Koreans invade
through Mexico?

31:00.243 --> 31:02.210
I just saw <i>red dawn,</i> okay?
It could happen.

31:02.245 --> 31:03.445
One of our own has turned

31:03.479 --> 31:06.782
into a mean, bitter,
and angry person.

31:06.816 --> 31:08.216
Tina. Tina. That'd be Tina.

31:08.251 --> 31:09.418
She didn't used to be like this.

31:09.452 --> 31:12.020
She was a sweet girl who dated
Artie until he dumped her

31:12.055 --> 31:13.935
because he found out
she was faking her stutter.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.391
And then she dated Mike Chang
until he dumped her

31:16.426 --> 31:18.593
because she wasn't Asian enough
or something.

31:18.628 --> 31:21.263
Wait... is that really why
he dumped her? Yeah.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.498
Look, the point is, is that
it's time for us to step in.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.067
She's falling apart.

31:25.101 --> 31:26.635
I walked by
the too young to be bitter club

31:26.669 --> 31:30.639
<i>meeting this morning, and</i>
<i>she was the only one in there.</i>

31:34.911 --> 31:37.412
Those cakes are truly awesome.

31:37.447 --> 31:39.481
Dude, those things were moist
and chocolaty at the same time.

31:39.515 --> 31:41.116
Totally, totally.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.430
Guys, this isn't
about the cakes.

31:42.452 --> 31:43.919
I know how good they are.
I've had them, too.

31:43.953 --> 31:45.153
This is about us trying
to help Tina.

31:45.188 --> 31:46.455
Oh, of course, Blaine.

31:46.489 --> 31:48.423
You know, even though this is
all clearly your fault,

31:48.458 --> 31:50.659
you know, whatever you think
we should do, we're in.

32:09.979 --> 32:11.847
Ah, settling in nicely,
then, are we?

32:11.881 --> 32:13.815
You know, I think you
found your calling.

32:13.850 --> 32:17.686
Janitor Figgins, I think,
has a quiet dignity to it.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.154
You're not gonna get away
with this, Sue.

32:19.188 --> 32:20.655
Well, I believe I already have.

32:20.690 --> 32:23.358
And considering all
the scandalous behavior

32:23.393 --> 32:24.626
that I recently uncovered,

32:24.661 --> 32:27.362
I would say you are lucky
to have a job at all.

32:27.397 --> 32:29.097
You had better be nice to Donna.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.035
That woman is a Saint.

32:33.069 --> 32:34.436
And she's my rock.

32:34.470 --> 32:36.705
I'm afraid Donna isn't long
for this world.

32:36.739 --> 32:38.540
As soon as she returns
from her suspension,

32:38.574 --> 32:41.843
I plan on installing Becky
as my secretary.

32:41.878 --> 32:44.079
And I will refer
to her as my "beckretary."

32:44.113 --> 32:46.148
(Chuckles)

32:47.383 --> 32:48.583
What is that?

32:48.618 --> 32:52.120
That? Well, that's just
a five-gallon bucket

32:52.155 --> 32:53.889
of expired grade D meat slurry

32:53.923 --> 32:57.659
the poor kids at this school
were forced to eat

32:57.694 --> 32:59.528
every taco Tuesday under
the jackboot of that corrupt,

32:59.562 --> 33:02.731
decadent regime from which
they were recently liberated

33:02.765 --> 33:04.299
by one Sue Rodham Sylvester.

33:04.334 --> 33:05.734
That's not your middle name.

33:05.768 --> 33:07.135
Oh, yes, it is.

33:07.170 --> 33:08.570
I had it legally changed
this morning.

33:08.604 --> 33:11.406
(Chuckles) Now, what would you
like me to do with this canister

33:11.441 --> 33:13.208
of rancid horse offal?

33:13.242 --> 33:15.077
No, Sue, please! No!

33:16.946 --> 33:19.548
(Distorted):
No!

33:30.326 --> 33:33.028
Sue Sylvester!

33:34.030 --> 33:37.432
You are a monster!

33:39.001 --> 33:40.836
Tina:
What is happening

33:40.870 --> 33:42.571
and why did you
make me wear this?

33:42.605 --> 33:44.306
I had to break out
one of the <i>grease</i> costumes.

33:44.340 --> 33:45.807
(British accent):
Tina, I'm Paul.

33:45.842 --> 33:47.542
That's George, that's Ringo,

33:47.577 --> 33:48.744
and black John Lennon.

33:48.778 --> 33:49.978
Half black.

33:50.012 --> 33:52.012

you, and this is for you.

But I don't understand

35:59.275 --> 36:02.010
Well, we saw how lonely
you've been lately.

36:02.045 --> 36:03.912
And since we're the only
single guys left in glee club...

36:03.947 --> 36:06.181
And by single,
we mean single prom dates...

36:06.215 --> 36:08.183
We just wanted
to offer our services

36:08.217 --> 36:09.685
as dance partner
or corsage buyer

36:09.719 --> 36:12.621
or just general arm candy
for the big dance.

36:12.655 --> 36:13.655
Yeah, so you can pick one.

36:13.656 --> 36:14.623
And it's your choice.

36:14.657 --> 36:15.724
Obviously I'm excluded.

36:15.758 --> 36:18.694
Well, it's hard to pick.

36:18.728 --> 36:21.430
Ryder has arms
and Blaine is my boo,

36:21.464 --> 36:24.800
but I think I'll go with Sam,

36:24.834 --> 36:26.201
because he's the least gay

36:26.236 --> 36:27.536
and least Asian of all of you

36:27.570 --> 36:29.905
and I'm looking
to change my patterns.

36:29.939 --> 36:31.273
Seriously, though...

36:31.307 --> 36:32.307
Thank you, guys.

36:32.342 --> 36:33.475
I really needed this.

36:33.509 --> 36:35.410
Bring it in, Tina.

36:35.445 --> 36:36.745
Oh, I love you.

36:36.779 --> 36:39.147
I love you.
Thank you, boo.

36:39.182 --> 36:40.849
(Indistinct conversation)

36:44.038 --> 36:45.776
Look, I, uh, know
we usually take

36:45.797 --> 36:46.897
the highway to the airport,

36:46.931 --> 36:48.132
but somebody told me
about this shortcut

36:48.166 --> 36:49.266
through the back roads.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.767
Dad, you can stop it.

36:50.802 --> 36:53.971
I know you're driving me
to my surprise proposal.

36:54.005 --> 36:55.506
I should have known you knew.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.274
You're the kid who planned
his own surprise party

36:57.308 --> 36:58.575
for his tenth birthday.

36:58.610 --> 37:00.010
That Justin Timberlake piñata

37:00.044 --> 37:01.211
was a perfect likeness.

37:01.246 --> 37:03.313
Well, I wouldn't know.

37:03.348 --> 37:04.948
You okay?

37:04.983 --> 37:06.250
You look like I'm driving you

37:06.284 --> 37:07.351
to your execution.

37:09.721 --> 37:11.288
I can't tell.

37:11.322 --> 37:14.224
I mean, I really
love Blaine, and...

37:14.259 --> 37:15.959
He makes me feel so connected

37:15.994 --> 37:18.662
and safe and loved,

37:18.696 --> 37:20.731
and I don't think I'm ever
gonna find someone else

37:20.765 --> 37:22.766
who's gonna make me
feel like that.

37:24.102 --> 37:26.937
But we're both so young.

37:26.971 --> 37:29.006
Um...

37:29.040 --> 37:32.142
Your mom and I met
when we were 22,

37:32.177 --> 37:34.611
and I asked her to marry
me six months in.

37:34.646 --> 37:36.079
We were just kids.

37:38.116 --> 37:40.818
<i>Yeah...</i>
<i>It was really hard at first.</i>

37:40.852 --> 37:42.920
<i>You know, you go in</i>
<i>with all these fantasies</i>

37:42.954 --> 37:44.121
<i>about what your life together</i>

37:44.155 --> 37:45.222
is gonna be like:

37:45.256 --> 37:46.990
Nothing but laughing

37:47.025 --> 37:49.259
and dancing around
in your underwear,

37:49.294 --> 37:50.394
cooking pasta,

37:50.428 --> 37:52.429
<i>and sex.</i>

37:52.464 --> 37:54.164
<i>A lot of sex.</i>

37:54.199 --> 37:56.200
(Kurt sighs)

37:58.002 --> 37:59.603
It's hard being married, though.

37:59.637 --> 38:01.638
It's hard enough
being in your 20s.

38:03.141 --> 38:04.141
Do you wish you'd waited?

38:04.142 --> 38:07.010
Not one second more.

38:07.045 --> 38:08.946
I wish I'd met her
ten years earlier.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.714
I didn't know then that
I was only going to get

38:10.749 --> 38:12.149
so much time
with her, you know?

38:12.183 --> 38:13.350
That she was gonna
leave us so soon.

38:13.384 --> 38:16.887
I'd take 50 more years
of late-night fights

38:16.921 --> 38:19.022
about, you know,
me working late

38:19.057 --> 38:20.190
or the gas bill

38:20.225 --> 38:23.560
or her letting the milk
go bad for just...

38:23.595 --> 38:27.798
Ten more minutes
with her next to me.

38:27.832 --> 38:29.633
We only get a few days

38:29.667 --> 38:31.201
when you come down to it, Kurt.

38:31.236 --> 38:32.836
You know that
better than anyone.

38:35.039 --> 38:36.974
Look, totally
being honest here...

38:39.377 --> 38:41.845
Blaine asked me
what I thought about this,

38:41.880 --> 38:43.180
and I gave him my opinion.

38:43.214 --> 38:44.815
Which was?

38:44.849 --> 38:46.450
My opinion doesn't matter here.

38:46.484 --> 38:48.018
You're your own man now.

38:48.053 --> 38:51.455
But giving you a choice
means you gotta make one.

38:51.489 --> 38:53.090
So relax.

38:53.124 --> 38:55.392
Hear what the guy has to say.

38:55.427 --> 38:58.629
I mean, all you gotta do
is say yes, no, or maybe.

38:59.998 --> 39:00.964
Is there another option?

41:39.024 --> 41:40.524
We met right here.

41:40.558 --> 41:42.092
I took this man's hand,

41:42.127 --> 41:43.367
and we ran down that hallway...

41:43.395 --> 41:44.828
And for those of you
that know me,

41:44.863 --> 41:46.330
know I'm not in the habit
of taking people's hands

41:46.364 --> 41:47.665
I've never met before, but...

41:47.699 --> 41:48.799
I think that

41:48.833 --> 41:51.201
my soul knew something

41:51.236 --> 41:55.339
that my body and my mind
didn't know yet.

41:57.075 --> 41:59.243
It knew that our hands

41:59.277 --> 42:00.811
were meant to hold each other,

42:00.845 --> 42:02.313
fearlessly

42:02.347 --> 42:03.714
and forever.

42:03.748 --> 42:06.850
Which is why
it's never really felt like

42:06.885 --> 42:08.652
I've been getting to know you;

42:08.687 --> 42:11.255
it's always felt like I was
remembering you from something.

42:11.289 --> 42:13.290
As if in every lifetime

42:13.324 --> 42:14.625
that you and I have ever lived,

42:14.659 --> 42:15.893
we have chosen to come back

42:15.927 --> 42:17.561
and find each other

42:17.595 --> 42:19.663
and fall in love all over again,

42:19.698 --> 42:22.700
over and over for all eternity.

42:24.135 --> 42:26.003
And I just feel so lucky

42:26.037 --> 42:28.005
that I found you
so soon in this lifetime,

42:28.039 --> 42:30.541
because all I want to do,

42:30.575 --> 42:33.544
all-all I've ever
wanted to do...

42:33.578 --> 42:35.679
Is spend my life loving you.
