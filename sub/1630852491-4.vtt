-STANLEY: Jack!
Where the hell are you?

00:06.540 --> 00:07.908
Hello, Mrs. Pearson.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.144
Oh. I'm such a klutz.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.979
You know what?
Go pack your things, okay?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.814
-We're leaving.
-MARILYN: Jack, stop.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.549
JACK:
You deserve more than
what's in that house.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.984
Do you have a dream?

00:17.017 --> 00:19.387
I just want to make sure
my mom is okay.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.489
Get her settled
at her friend's place,

00:21.522 --> 00:22.756
and then...

00:22.790 --> 00:25.859
A decent job. A wife.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.395
A family.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.030
Okay. Um...

00:30.064 --> 00:31.932
Okay. Thank you.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.935
Who was that?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.606
My mom died.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.282
*

00:59.327 --> 01:01.262
REBECCA:
What about this gray one?

01:05.099 --> 01:07.768
It's light gray.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.171
I can't wear a gray suit.
It has to be black.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.942
Um, well, maybe we can get
a deal at Gimbels.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.778
-Suits are just so expensive.
-Doesn't matter what it costs.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.780
It's my mother's funeral.
It's got to be black.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.782
Of course.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.118
-Of course.
-(Jack sighs)

01:24.152 --> 01:26.587
I just--
it doesn't seem real.

01:28.622 --> 01:32.960
I feel like the phone's
gonna ring on Sunday.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.796
She'll ask about the kids.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.465
After a few minutes
of catching up,

01:37.498 --> 01:39.133
she'll say
what she always says...

01:39.167 --> 01:40.201
BOTH:
"Don't let me keep you."

01:45.439 --> 01:46.974
It doesn't seem real.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.782

01:58.852 --> 02:02.022
WEATHERMAN (on radio):
With a cold front coming across
Lake Erie from Ontario,

02:02.055 --> 02:04.091
we're looking at eight
to ten inches of snow

02:04.124 --> 02:05.626
and icy conditions
on the roadways

02:05.659 --> 02:07.795
for at least the next 48 hours.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.597
We have a high of 33...

02:09.630 --> 02:11.131
You know, I'm-a...
I'm gonna hit the road

02:11.165 --> 02:13.301
before the snow gets too heavy.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.436
I really feel like
we should go with you, babe.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.770
I mean, I could run upstairs

02:16.804 --> 02:18.339
and pack a quick bag
for me and the kids.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.973
Bec, come on.
We talked about this, all right?

02:20.007 --> 02:21.275
I've done the math.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.377
Three six-year-olds
on a four-hour car ride?

02:23.411 --> 02:25.379
(scoffs) It ain't worth it.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.315
But you're our guy, Jack.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.884
You're worth ten hours
in the car, in a blizzard.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.286
Only ten?

02:32.320 --> 02:34.222
Yeah, ten is the maximum,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.989
but in a blizzard,
in a torrential blizzard.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.025
Can blizzards be torrential?

02:38.058 --> 02:39.627
You know, I-I think
that's just rainstorms.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.795
Jack, I'm serious.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.299
Hey, Bec, it ain't worth it,
all right?

02:45.333 --> 02:48.502
I mean, the kids, they...
they barely knew her.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.338
I mean, when was
the last time she visited?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.172
They were, what,
like a year old?

02:52.206 --> 02:54.141
Yeah, but they talked to her
on the phone.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.510
And that's all she's been
for years,

02:56.544 --> 02:58.679
just a voice on the other end
of the telephone.

02:58.712 --> 03:02.383
Lookit, Bec, knowing my mom,

03:02.416 --> 03:04.485
I've got a funeral to plan

03:04.518 --> 03:06.287
and a lifetime of loose ends
to tie up.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.692
Look, it's just-- it's better
if I do this alone.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.395
(footsteps approaching)

03:14.428 --> 03:16.230
Which grandma died?

03:16.264 --> 03:18.098
KATE:
Daddy's mommy died.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.901
Daddy's mommy is dead.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.336
RANDALL:
Stop saying she's dead.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.672
But she is dead.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.939
Right, Daddy?

03:25.973 --> 03:28.509
Yeah, that's right, Katie girl.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.078
Uh, Grandma Marilyn passed away,

03:31.111 --> 03:34.214
and we're gonna miss her
very much.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.649
Yes.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.788
Can we play in the snow?

03:40.821 --> 03:42.790
Uh... sure.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.124
REBECCA:
Maybe after breakfast.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.626
Yeah, uh...

03:45.659 --> 03:47.461
why-why don't you guys wear
the mittens

03:47.495 --> 03:49.597
-that Grandma made for you
last Christmas?
-REBECCA: Yeah.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.265
But they're so scratchy.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.602
Yeah, they feel like there's,
like, bugs crawling on my hands.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.437
KEVIN: Yeah, they're too warm.
I don't like them.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.440
REBECCA:
Okay, well, we'll figure out
the mittens situation.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.610
*

04:16.324 --> 04:19.793
You didn't have to drive me.
I could have taken the bus.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.799
It was nice of Cheryl to put me
up for the past few weeks,

04:25.833 --> 04:29.403
but moving in with Debby
will be good.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.104
She's family.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.808
And I need to get further away.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.612
From Dad. Yeah.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.654
Ohio looks nice.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.122
Looks the same as Pennsylvania.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.028
I'll miss you, Jackie.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.465
I don't like being
this far away from you.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.768
Yeah, I know, Ma,
but you can call anytime.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.471
No, I don't want to be a bother.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.473
The last thing you need is
to sit around

05:05.506 --> 05:07.541
wondering when I'm gonna call.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.943
God knows I've already caused
you enough trouble lately.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.012
No, it's no trouble, Ma.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.692
Sunday nights.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.294
Every Sunday, 6:00,

05:27.327 --> 05:28.796
I'll be by the phone.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.698
You want to call,
I'll be there to pick it up.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.869
-6:00, Sunday.
-Mm-hmm.

05:37.204 --> 05:40.340
And I'll visit, okay?
I promise.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.519
*

06:04.798 --> 06:07.435
(clicks tongue)
Look who finally showed up.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.302
Only took you 13 years.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.719
*

06:30.724 --> 06:32.693
(footsteps approaching)

06:32.726 --> 06:34.361
(Debby sighs)

06:34.394 --> 06:36.964
Well, it's been a while.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.633
I thought we'd see more of you
over the years.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.901
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.438
Yeah, I just, um...

06:44.472 --> 06:47.941
It's tough--
the triplets and work.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.777
Um...

06:49.810 --> 06:52.279
I mean, my mom and I,
we spoke once a week.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.281
Oh, I know.

06:54.314 --> 06:58.118
Every Sunday, 6:00,
world stopped spinning.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.387
Look, Cousin Debby...

07:00.420 --> 07:01.822
You don't have to call me that.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.458
I'm not your cousin.
I was her cousin.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.427
I think that still
makes us cousins.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.829
Debby's fine.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.299
Debby, I'm here to help, so...

07:12.332 --> 07:13.767
if you want to just
point me in the direction

07:13.801 --> 07:15.669
of the nearest funeral parlor,
I'll...

07:15.703 --> 07:17.304
buy the casket,
organize the plot,

07:17.337 --> 07:20.007
-the service...
-Yeah. It's all been
taken care of.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.677
The flowers?

07:23.711 --> 07:25.846
I own a flower shop, Jack.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.982
Right.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.684
Yeah.

07:30.718 --> 07:33.453
The funeral is
the day after tomorrow.

07:33.487 --> 07:37.658
2:00 p.m.-- that way
we don't have to serve a meal.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.662
Well, my mom was lucky
to have you,

07:41.695 --> 07:43.697
figure all this out for her.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.965
I didn't do anything.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.802
Marilyn planned it all out
herself ages ago.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.206
I guess she just didn't want
to be a burden to anyone.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.348
(takes deep breath)

08:04.918 --> 08:06.654
Is there anything that I can do?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.824
The eulogy.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.794
I'm not really good
with giving speeches.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.062
Oh.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.964
Look, if you can't handle it,

08:16.997 --> 08:18.699
-I'm-I'm happy to do it.
-No, no, no.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.167
No. I got it.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.338
I was thinking maybe
I could read one of my poems.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.808
You write poems?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.509
Yeah, I do, a little.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.813
I mean, mostly just for myself.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.582
Your mom loved poetry.

08:34.615 --> 08:38.251
She was always encouraging me
to write more, so...

08:38.285 --> 08:40.187
My mom loved poetry?

08:44.558 --> 08:47.995
I'm gonna do the flowers,
obviously.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.331
Maybe you could find a dress
for the burial.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.934
Whatever you think she'd like.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.468
No problem.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.578
(sets book down)

09:39.579 --> 09:40.981
(sighs)

09:48.956 --> 09:50.323
(phone rings)

09:52.092 --> 09:54.461
Hey, Ma. How's Ohio?

09:54.494 --> 09:56.229
It's fine.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.230
Yeah?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.766
And you?

09:58.799 --> 10:00.467
You good? You...

10:00.500 --> 10:02.102
You settling in
a little bit more?

10:03.671 --> 10:06.306
Jackie, I made a mistake.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.376
Wh-- What kind of mistake?

10:10.343 --> 10:13.346
I just wanted him to send me
a few things.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.515
My mother's china teapot.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.850
Some pictures.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.285
You called Dad?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.187
I realized
as soon as he answered

10:20.220 --> 10:21.354
that it was a bad idea.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.456
Does he know where you are?

10:23.490 --> 10:26.026
No. No. I don't think so.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.462
I'm sorry.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.699
You don't need to be sorry, Ma.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.136
How's Rebecca?

10:36.169 --> 10:37.370
Are you two still...?

10:37.404 --> 10:38.672
She's great.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.141
Yeah, no,
we're-we're doing great.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.210
Good.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.678
That's good.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.949
Well...

10:48.982 --> 10:50.650
Don't let me keep you.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.521
Okay, Ma. I'll-I'll talk to you
next Sunday. I love you.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
*

11:07.334 --> 11:08.335
(cat meows)

11:20.080 --> 11:23.016
Nope. We're not serving a meal.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.217
Okay.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.686
All right.
I'll see you there. 2:00.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.855
Okay.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.591
-(receiver clicks)
-Have you been in touch
with my father?

11:31.624 --> 11:32.692
To tell him about my mom?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.694
Stanley?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.797
No way I'm calling that bastard.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.701
-(meowing)
-Whoa.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.703
Hey, do you want to
maybe feed your cat?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.405
-(chuckles)
-That's not my cat.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.240
That's your mom's cat.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.442
My mom had a cat?

11:49.476 --> 11:51.779
My dad hated cats.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.947
Exactly.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.784
Hey, cat, why don't you go
back to Mike's?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.718
Who's Mike?

11:58.752 --> 12:02.055
Uh, he is your mom's boyfriend.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.624
Mike McCreary.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.127
Cat's living with him now.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.462
(scribbling on paper)

12:09.496 --> 12:12.132
Look, if you want
to make yourself useful,

12:12.165 --> 12:15.068
maybe you can just
bring the cat back to Mike's.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.469
His place is just up the road.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.438
Look out for his van.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.607
Yeah, sure.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.509
(grunts):
Come on, cat.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.413
(sighs)

12:37.357 --> 12:38.826
(sighs)

12:43.163 --> 12:44.998
Uh, you must be Jack.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.900
You must be Mike.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.802
I was hoping you'd come by.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.670
-(meows)
-(chuckles)

12:50.703 --> 12:52.639
Well, come on in.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.474
Hey, there, Cat.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.845
Uh, here.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.313
(chuckles)

13:00.347 --> 13:01.982
Cat got a name?

13:02.015 --> 13:05.418
Yep. Cat Benatar.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.254
You know Marilyn's
sense of humor.

13:07.287 --> 13:13.126
Yeah, keeps getting out
and running back to Marilyn's.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.096
Just doesn't understand
that, um...

13:16.129 --> 13:19.166
that, you know, that...
that she's gone.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.839
JACK:
Okay.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.511
Your mom was a good woman.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.147
Thanks.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.716
Um, how are, uh,

13:36.749 --> 13:39.419
Rebecca and the,
and the kids holding up?

13:42.089 --> 13:45.192
-Okay.
-Triplets, man, that's...

13:45.225 --> 13:47.727
-That's-- I don't know
how you do it.
-Yeah.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.529
Yeah. Hey, you and, uh,

13:49.562 --> 13:51.531
you and your kids
watch, uh, wrestling?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.366
You know, Hulk Hogan,

13:53.400 --> 13:55.202
uh, André the Giant,
King Kong Bundy?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.570
No, I-I think they're
a little young for that.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.306
Oh, no, but they're not.
(stammers)

13:59.339 --> 14:01.408
I know a lot of folks complain
that it's fake,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.743
but these guys,
these guys are athletes,

14:03.776 --> 14:06.579
I mean, real athletes. The...

14:06.613 --> 14:08.982
(exhales)
What am I...

14:09.016 --> 14:10.683
(chuckles)

14:10.717 --> 14:12.986
Sorry, man, um...

14:13.020 --> 14:15.188
I'm-I'm nervous.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.226
It's just that your mom

14:19.259 --> 14:21.428
talked about you and the,
and the kids all the time,

14:21.461 --> 14:26.299
and it's, uh... this isn't how
I pictured us meeting.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.769
Yeah.

14:29.802 --> 14:34.207
So, um... want a beer?

14:35.275 --> 14:37.077
Sure.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.579
Take whatever's cold.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.781
I was, um,

14:41.814 --> 14:45.752
going through some photos
of, uh, me and Marilyn.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.721
-Thought you might
like to see 'em.
-Yeah.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.967
Will you look at that smile?

15:00.000 --> 15:03.836
Now, that, that is Marilyn
through and through.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.208
She looks happy.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.644
She was. We were.

15:12.679 --> 15:16.883
Can I ask how you two met?

15:16.916 --> 15:20.287
Well, um, I was...

15:20.320 --> 15:22.289
-I was always a night owl.
-Mm-hmm.

15:22.322 --> 15:26.226
But, uh, one morning, I wake up
real early, no reason,

15:26.259 --> 15:28.962
but I can't fall back asleep,
so I figure

15:28.996 --> 15:32.332
get a cup of coffee
at the place down the way.

15:32.365 --> 15:36.236
So, I sit down at my favorite
table by the window,

15:36.269 --> 15:41.574
and this woman comes over
and says, "You're at my table."

15:41.608 --> 15:46.313
Well, it turns out,
we had the same favorite table.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.116
She always sat there early
and I sat there late.

15:49.149 --> 15:53.853
So, I offer to share the table.

15:53.886 --> 15:57.757
The next morning, I got there
when the place opened,

15:57.790 --> 15:59.459
so did she.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.662
And that was the end
of the night owl.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.866
You know, it took, um...

16:06.899 --> 16:10.470
took some time
to earn her trust, but...

16:10.503 --> 16:12.939
but I always knew
how to make her laugh.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.142
(chuckles)
She...

16:15.175 --> 16:17.010
she had a great laugh.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.482
JACK:
Can't remember the last time

16:22.515 --> 16:24.251
I heard my mother laugh.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.887
I guess she was...

16:27.920 --> 16:32.625
she was always on high alert
with my dad.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.161
Yeah.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.563
Well...
(clears throat)

16:36.596 --> 16:38.831
...let me tell you this.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.702
Nothing was more important
to her than your Sunday calls.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.571
She looked forward to 'em
all week.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.977
You were her hero, Jack.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.847
You're the one that got her
out of that house.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.123
Not a hero, Mike.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.359
I mean, I...

17:06.393 --> 17:07.927
knew nothing about her life.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.762
I mean, I missed
the whole damn thing, so...

17:09.796 --> 17:13.400
Thanks for showing me
the photos, and for the beer.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.104

18:05.785 --> 18:08.488
Hey, Jack, it's 6:00!

18:11.023 --> 18:12.425
(sighs)

18:14.361 --> 18:16.829
Hi, Marilyn. Right on time.
(chuckles)

18:16.863 --> 18:20.300
Oh, um, thank you so much
for the-the scarf you sent.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.735
-It's so great.
-Oh, you like it?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.003
I do, I love it. Thank you.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.506
Hold on, let me get Jack
for you. Jack?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.808
Jack?

18:28.841 --> 18:30.510
-Here.
-(whispers): I got-- I got it.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.678
Hi, buddy.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.447
Hey, Ma. Hey, how, uh...

18:34.481 --> 18:35.848
How's it going?

18:35.882 --> 18:38.251
Oh, everything's fine.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.819
Tell me about the little ones.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.588
Uh, they're-they're good.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.490
Good-- You know,
ev-everyone's good.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.425
-Jack.
-Oh, no. Oh...

18:45.458 --> 18:46.993
-He spit up. Here.
-Yeah.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.762
JACK:
Get that. Okay.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.130
Hey, when, uh,

18:51.164 --> 18:53.099
when are you gonna come
meet your grandkids?

18:53.132 --> 18:57.036
Oh, I'll come
once things settle down.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.807
Mom, we got triplets, all right?
It's never gonna settle down.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.343
I'll come soon, Jackie.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.981
Well, it's a big city, Mom.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.850
I haven't seen the man
in a decade.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.486
So I-I think it's safe to say
you can visit your family

19:13.520 --> 19:15.222
-without running into Dad.
-No, I know.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.826
But Debby needs help
at the flower shop and...

19:21.828 --> 19:23.663
I-- Look, I'll plan a trip soon.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.833
Okay.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.704
There's this pond by the house.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.306
It freezes over in the winter,

19:33.340 --> 19:35.742
and everyone in the neighborhood
goes ice-skating.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.210
You should bring the kids.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.213
Kids can't really walk yet, Mom.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.148
No, of course not.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.316
I know that. I'm just...

19:43.350 --> 19:45.985
saying, one day.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.054
-Yeah, no, we'll...
-(distant crying)

19:48.087 --> 19:51.157
(shushes) ...we'll-we'll get
the kids on skates

19:51.190 --> 19:52.459
as soon as we can.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.329
Well, don't let me keep you.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.498
Okay, Mom, I'll, uh,

19:58.531 --> 20:00.500
I'll talk to you next Sunday,
okay? I love you.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.734
-I lo...
-(phone crackles)

20:01.768 --> 20:03.202

Hi, sweetie.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.498
(horn honks in distance)

20:43.476 --> 20:45.745
Hi. Can I, uh...

20:45.778 --> 20:48.648
I-I'll have a coffee, please.
Thanks.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.467
(overlapping chatter)

21:12.605 --> 21:15.442
-Hey, Jack. Come on over.
-Mike.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.178
-(thumps seat)
-Right there.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.814
We are having
a round of 7 and 7s

21:21.848 --> 21:23.450
in honor of our Marilyn.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.486
Okay. All right.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.054
-Hi.
-Hey.
-MIKE: All right.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.791
-Everything good?
-Yeah, things are all right.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.693
It's a nice, a nice town.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.027
All right, here we go,
here we go.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.529
Thank you, Shanice.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.297
-Nicely done.
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.832
-WENDY: Thank you.
-MIKE: All right, guys,

21:39.866 --> 21:41.501
let's raise 'em up.
Raise 'em up.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.169
To our Marilyn.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.871
-DEBBY: To our Marilyn.
-Yeah, baby.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.710
-(exhales)
-WENDY: Oh, that tastes...

21:50.743 --> 21:51.978
MIKE:
Let me tell you something
about your mom.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.647
You don't know this.
She would make up terms.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.649
-DEBBY: Oh, no, oh, here we go.
-A whole thing.
A whole fictitious...

21:56.683 --> 21:59.218
-DEBBY: Her bad knitting.
-MIKE: She was a volume knitter.

21:59.251 --> 22:00.453
Not precision.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.055
(Mike speaking indistinctly)

22:03.089 --> 22:05.958
DEBBY:
...bridge term called
"the Jacoby transfer."

22:05.992 --> 22:07.794
MIKE (laughs):
This is made up.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.562
This is not real, right?
This is not real.

22:09.596 --> 22:10.563
(Wendy laughs)

22:10.597 --> 22:13.199
It's the Jacoby transfer.

22:13.232 --> 22:15.234
See, they don't even know.
They don't even know.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.704
-I'm telling you...
-It's totally made up.
It's a totally made-up thing.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.305
Okay, okay, maybe, maybe...

22:19.338 --> 22:21.808
-You looked it up...
-You made that up...

22:21.841 --> 22:23.876

23:35.782 --> 23:39.285
-STANLEY (over phone): Yeah?
-She's dead.

23:39.318 --> 23:43.089
Three days ago, Mom had
an aneurysm and she died.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.157
(TV playing indistinctly)

23:50.830 --> 23:53.099
Aren't you gonna say anything?

23:53.132 --> 23:58.104
Ah, Jackie, I'm so sorry.

23:58.137 --> 24:01.440
That's terrible news.
I-It's terrible news.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.442
When's the funeral? I-I mean,

24:03.476 --> 24:04.644
I should pay my respects.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.813
I wasn't inviting you.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.315
You know,

24:09.348 --> 24:14.621
even after she left you,
you were always there.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.657
Just hanging over us,
keeping us apart.

24:17.690 --> 24:21.794
My whole life,
I never really knew her.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.130
I mean, she had a real life
out here,

24:24.163 --> 24:26.599
and I never saw it
and now she's dead.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.601
And I missed the whole thing
because of you.

24:28.635 --> 24:32.204
Look, I don't, I-I don't
want to fight with you.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.675
I never stopped loving her.
She was my wife.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.410
When she left me, it was
the worst day of my life.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.215
You listen to me.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.218
Do not show up at that funeral.

24:46.252 --> 24:49.221
You hear me?

24:49.255 --> 24:51.323
She was my wife, Jack.

24:53.259 --> 24:56.062
I'll do what I damn well please.

25:42.474 --> 25:45.311
How's the eulogy coming along?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.950
I made a mistake, Debby.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.786
I, uh...

25:53.820 --> 25:55.487
called my dad.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.457
Is he coming?

25:58.490 --> 26:02.662
I told him not to,
but I don't know.

It's so great
finally having you here.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.784
I hope the, uh, sofa bed
was comfortable enough.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.819
(running footsteps)

27:01.153 --> 27:02.521
Ma.

27:02.554 --> 27:03.990
Rebecca asked you a question.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.424
No, no, it's okay, Jack.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.093
MARILYN (laughs):
I-I'm sorry.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.295
It's just...

27:11.230 --> 27:12.799
...do you think he knows
I'm here?

27:12.832 --> 27:14.967
Of course not.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.336
I mean, I haven't talked
to him in years.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.008
Why don't I start on lunch?

27:31.984 --> 27:33.986
Mom, listen.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.822
How about I make
your favorite, Jackie?

27:36.756 --> 27:37.790
What's my favorite?

27:37.824 --> 27:39.692
Hot dogs and tomato soup.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.829
Since when?

27:42.862 --> 27:45.865
Since always. You loved
hot dogs and tomato soup.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.134
Maybe Nicky.
I-I don't remember...

27:48.167 --> 27:51.337
No, it wasn't Nicky, it was you.

27:52.604 --> 27:55.474
You'd go out
and you'd play in the snow,

27:55.507 --> 27:56.876
and when you came home,

27:56.909 --> 28:00.646
I'd make you hot dogs
and tomato soup.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.516
We'd sit at the kitchen table
and we'd watch snow fall.

28:04.550 --> 28:08.187
It's one
of my favorite memories.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.323
I know it's not much, but...

28:11.357 --> 28:14.426
it wasn't all bad,
your childhood.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.596
I know.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.601
Next time, you'll come visit me.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.872
And we can take the kids
skating on the pond.

28:25.905 --> 28:29.541
It's so pretty in the winter.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.043
Okay.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.387
(skate clatters)

28:44.824 --> 28:46.893
(phone ringing)

28:51.998 --> 28:54.300
-Hello?
-JACK: We never took 'em
to the pond

28:54.333 --> 28:55.802
by my mom's house.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.436
To ice-skate.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.073
It was just such a long drive,

29:01.107 --> 29:03.342
and we could never
really find the time.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.613
I know.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.320
I got to write a eulogy.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.924
-What are you gonna say?
-I don't know.

29:19.658 --> 29:21.660
Yeah, I don't know.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.334
I don't know what to say.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.470
I've never lost a parent.

29:31.503 --> 29:35.107
But... I'm here for you.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.977
And I love you very much.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.281
Yeah, I love you, too.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.619
*

30:08.574 --> 30:11.377
*

30:14.713 --> 30:16.748
Wish me luck.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.820
(sighs)

30:30.362 --> 30:32.398
*

30:38.204 --> 30:39.671
(knocking on door)

30:48.614 --> 30:51.683
It's okay. We'll hide it away.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.719
I'll put aside some money
to get you a new one.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.521
Your father will never know.

30:58.224 --> 31:01.160
(quiet chatter)

31:01.193 --> 31:03.195
(organ playing)

31:07.133 --> 31:09.101
-The flowers are nice.
-Yeah, don't start.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.737
-I know it's too much.
-Nah.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.272
She would've loved it.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.612
(chatter continues)

31:20.646 --> 31:22.581
DEBBY:
Do you think he's gonna show?

31:22.614 --> 31:25.451
-I don't know.
-(organ stops)

31:25.484 --> 31:28.720
PASTOR:
If we can all take our seats.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.190
We'll begin with a reading

31:31.223 --> 31:33.993
by Marilyn's
beloved cousin Debra.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.070
(door closes)

31:46.838 --> 31:48.574
DEBBY:
Um... (clears throat)

31:50.309 --> 31:53.145
I wrote, I wrote a poem.

31:55.447 --> 32:00.019
She always told me I should
write more poems, so...

32:01.687 --> 32:04.490
"Five o'clock, six o'clock,

32:04.523 --> 32:07.960
"seven, eight.

32:07.994 --> 32:11.497
"Tell the morning,
night's running late.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.466
"Nine o'clock, ten o'clock,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.236
"eleven, noon.

32:17.269 --> 32:21.140
"That's not the sun up high,
but the moon.

32:23.109 --> 32:26.645
"Wake the stars
for a double shift.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.748
"It's dark, this night,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.051
"and it won't lift.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.622
"Because if I stay right here
in bed...

32:40.059 --> 32:42.628
...I can still believe
she isn't dead."

32:48.900 --> 32:50.202
(paper shuffles)

32:52.971 --> 32:54.840
Rest in peace.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.679
PASTOR:
And now I'd like to invite up

33:00.712 --> 33:03.182
Marilyn's beloved son Jack.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.568
My mother was...

33:24.836 --> 33:26.505
...she was a good mother.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.008
She did her best...

33:31.943 --> 33:33.845
...and I loved her.

33:39.351 --> 33:42.354
W-What I want to say...

33:49.928 --> 33:53.699
What I want to say
about her is...

33:57.035 --> 33:58.737
(door opens)

34:22.994 --> 34:26.132
The house I grew up in

34:26.165 --> 34:29.635
wasn't an easy place
to be a son.

34:31.603 --> 34:35.006
But it wasn't an easy place
to be a mother, either.

34:36.342 --> 34:40.279
We did our best, the both of us,

34:40.312 --> 34:43.849
and we were lucky
because we got out.

34:46.152 --> 34:50.989
But when you live
in a house like that,

34:51.022 --> 34:54.260
there's a part of you
that never gets out.

34:56.328 --> 35:00.766
So you build a new house.

35:02.134 --> 35:05.504
A better house
for a better life.

35:05.537 --> 35:08.140
And you try as hard as you can

35:08.174 --> 35:12.178
to make sure that part
of you that still lives

35:12.211 --> 35:15.481
in that old house
is as small as possible.

35:18.784 --> 35:22.654
I did my best to forget
everything about that house.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.026
But there...

35:28.059 --> 35:31.597
there were so many little
details.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.632
Uh...

35:33.665 --> 35:36.335
Heavy footsteps.

35:36.368 --> 35:39.205
Cracking of a beer.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.640
The creak of an armchair.

35:43.909 --> 35:47.546
I don't know if she was ever
able to forget

35:47.579 --> 35:50.616
any of the details
of that house, but I do know

35:50.649 --> 35:53.285
she filled up her life
with new ones.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.421
Ones worth remembering.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.790
A dish of chocolates.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.528
A... basket of yarn.

36:02.561 --> 36:03.962
(laughs softly)

36:03.995 --> 36:06.832
A cat that keeps coming back.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.641
There are four people
here today.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.944
My wife. My children.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.348
Her grandchildren.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.451
They gave me a new home.

36:28.019 --> 36:31.623
And Debby, Mike...

36:32.791 --> 36:34.560
...and everyone here today.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.097
You gave that to her.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.772
As her son,

36:46.805 --> 36:51.142
I am very grateful to you all.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.046
Thank you.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.454
Okay, Ma.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.893
Don't let me keep you.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.736
(whispers):
Let's scoot you over, honey.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.382
All right, guys, now, this is
very important. It's probably

37:30.416 --> 37:32.384
the most important invention
in human history.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.119
It is called the skull crusher.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.655
Kate, do not do this
to your brothers.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.889
Unless they really deserve it.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.425
The skull crusher,
the skull crusher!

37:39.458 --> 37:41.460
-(laughter)
-Skull crusher!
This guy's too heavy!

37:41.493 --> 37:42.961
He's too heavy.
(shouts) I'm down!

37:42.994 --> 37:44.896
The champ is down.
Oh, three on one!

37:44.930 --> 37:46.598
Three on one! Ref!

37:46.632 --> 37:48.634
You know, I keep thinking
she never got to find out

37:48.667 --> 37:50.736
how the book ended.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.804
Clan of the Cave Bear. I mean,
she was only halfway through.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.006
That's what you're
worried about?

37:55.040 --> 37:57.008
She read that stupid thing
three times already.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.945
REBECCA:
I've read Clan of the Cave Bear.

37:59.978 --> 38:03.649
It's got some...
pretty sexy parts.

38:03.682 --> 38:07.586
Between us, I think Marilyn went
for Mike because, around here,

38:07.619 --> 38:10.255
he's the closest thing
she could find to a Neanderthal.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.591
Hey, hey, I heard that.
And it's accurate.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.192
(laughter)

38:14.225 --> 38:15.293
Didn't need to know that.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.162
I might have to reread
this book.

38:17.195 --> 38:19.765
MIKE:
Give 'em the bottle opener!
Bottle opener!

38:19.798 --> 38:22.501
Hey, do you think
the cat's gonna be okay?

38:22.534 --> 38:26.972
No, Jack. I think the cat
is 100% gonna get hit by a car.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.508
(laughter)

38:29.541 --> 38:31.142
Ah...

38:31.176 --> 38:32.811
(Mike shouting playfully)

38:36.482 --> 38:38.450
*

38:38.484 --> 38:40.986
MIKE:
Just like that. That's the move.
That's the move.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.721
Get back on your feet.
Just like that.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.823
Like a champ. There you go.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.692
All right, zoom back down.
Nicely done.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.598
*

39:05.210 --> 39:06.645
All right. Who's hungry?

39:06.678 --> 39:08.146
KIDS:
Me.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.148
Eh, I could eat.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.418
Okay, I'll get
something started.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.886
No, no, that's okay. I got it.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.049
*

39:46.585 --> 39:49.087
I made your favorite, Jackie.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.658
This should warm you up.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.302
JACK:
All right, so my mom...

40:05.671 --> 40:08.907
...used to make this for me.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.609
Are these hot dogs?

40:10.642 --> 40:12.811
-Where's the bun?
-Just try it. Try it.

40:19.350 --> 40:20.919
How is it?

40:20.952 --> 40:22.187
It's so good.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.697
Here, let me have one of these.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.369
Mmm. It's not bad.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.288
(sniffles)

40:57.322 --> 40:59.390
(footsteps approach)

41:12.704 --> 41:15.406
I don't have a mom anymore.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.646
(crying)

41:42.433 --> 41:44.502
*

41:49.675 --> 41:51.009
(Jack sniffling)

42:12.197 --> 42:14.332
He dipped his hot dog
in the soup.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.102
She did it, too.

42:17.135 --> 42:20.438
That's okay.
You know, tomato soup is...

42:20.471 --> 42:22.440
(voice fading)

42:22.473 --> 42:23.942
*
