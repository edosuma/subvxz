WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.090
WILL:
Why are you shaking
your head, Mr. Gross?

00:04.130 --> 00:05.563
I don't know,
the usual reasons:

00:05.600 --> 00:07.591
disbelief, incredulity,
disappointment.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.632
Ah, I must be
endangering the future.

00:10.670 --> 00:13.332
No, just being
a bit melodramatic.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.302
So, you never tweaked
the algorithm?

00:15.340 --> 00:17.547
Chummie the Squirrel
just acts on his own?

00:17.580 --> 00:20.378
No, I didn't say that.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.819
But you said you
couldn't impact the results.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.181
Yes, but the
algorithm needs

00:23.220 --> 00:25.586
almost daily attention
and, uh, revision.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.554
WILL:
I see. And why would
you revise it?

00:27.590 --> 00:29.455
GROSS:
For one thing,
to avoid spam.

00:29.490 --> 00:32.527
Spammers are constantly trying
to game the search results.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.064
So we adapt the algorithm
to avoid that.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.064
(elevator bell dings)

00:46.610 --> 00:48.532
ALICIA:
Deena Lampard.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.588
ALICIA: It should only
take a minute more.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.815
I recognize you both
from the trial.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.658
_ You work for_
Neil Gross's law firm?

01:02.690 --> 01:04.658
Yes. He hates
you guys.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.750
May I ask you...
why are you here?

01:07.800 --> 01:08.755
Good question.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.824
Why are we here, Dad?

01:09.870 --> 01:12.668
I'd rather wait
for the lavwer.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.769
She's a lawyer,
just like me.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.665
My dad likes
male lawyers.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.565
MR. LAMPAR_D:
My daughter likes
acting like

01:17.610 --> 01:19.771
I'm not in the room.
(laughing)

01:19.810 --> 01:21.778
Mr. Lampard, hello.

01:21.810 --> 01:22.640
Ms. Lampard.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.341
I'm David Lee, family law.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.314
I see you've met
Alicia and Kalinda.

01:26.350 --> 01:29.683
How may we help you today?

01:29.720 --> 01:30.687
Here, help yourself.

01:30.720 --> 01:31.812
Thank you, no.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.181
Uh, well, let's see.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.619
Uh, my daughter
needs a second opinion.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.355
Regarding?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.699
Okay. What is it?

01:40.730 --> 01:41.697
It's a prenup.

01:41.730 --> 01:43.129
I see.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.161
And who is your daughter
intending on marrying?

01:45.200 --> 01:46.360
Neil Gross.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.637
Neil Gross,
president of Chumhum?

01:51.670 --> 01:53.308
Yes.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.433
The ninth richest
man In America.
Yes.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.641
KALINDA: Who gave you
your first opinion, Deena?

01:57.680 --> 01:59.477
You said you wanted a second.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.489
Longcraine & Church.
(laughing)

02:02.520 --> 02:04.215
Mr. Gross's law firm.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.787
Yes, and my firm.
They thought I should sign it.

02:06.820 --> 02:07.787
(laughing):
Yes, of course they did.

02:07.820 --> 02:09.685
MR. LAMPARD:
We're middle-class
people, Mr. Lee.

02:09.730 --> 02:10.583
We don't have much money.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.791
And Deena is paying off
her student loans.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.491
Dad, it's not about that.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.691
I know.
But I want you protected.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.891
DAVID:
Well, that's why
we're here:

02:18.930 --> 02:21.262
to protect you.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.767
It's a travesty.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.936
If they divorce,
she gets nothing

02:23.970 --> 02:25.665
and she has to
immolate herself

02:25.710 --> 02:27.371
on an altar of
Chumhum's choosing.

02:27.410 --> 02:28.707
There's no
contingency here?

02:28.740 --> 02:30.674
No, but she's marrying
the ninth richest man

02:30.710 --> 02:31.608
in the country.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.811
We do right by her,
we get the business.

02:33.850 --> 02:35.511
_ Gross will never
bring hIS busmess here.

02:35.550 --> 02:36.687
He's made that clear.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.812
No, her business.

02:37.850 --> 02:39.283
We write this up correctly,

02:39.320 --> 02:40.878
and we'll get some kind of

02:40.920 --> 02:42.649
Bill & Melinda Gates
charity in her name.

02:42.690 --> 02:43.759
She'll bring it here.

02:43.790 --> 02:44.688
Is that what she wants?

02:44.730 --> 02:46.948
She's 28.
She doesn't know what she wants.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.524
She's in love.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.962
Well, not to put
too fine a point on this,

02:53.000 --> 02:54.865
but, time's up
in bankruptcy court

02:54.900 --> 02:57.903
and we're only halfway
to the $60 million we need.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.874
If we want to argue
for an extension,

02:59.910 --> 03:01.969
we need to show the court
some progress.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.602
DAVID:
Well, the fiance

03:03.650 --> 03:05.572
of the _ninth richest man
IS progress.

03:05.610 --> 03:06.747
I'm doing my job.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.917
You two do yours.

03:11.890 --> 03:13.448
Alicia, do you mind?

03:13.490 --> 03:14.684
Could you close the door?

03:17.430 --> 03:18.749
Why don't you
go ahead and sit.

03:20.430 --> 03:22.864
If this is about
the extension work, it's ready.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.562
No, no, no, we're... we're fine.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.569
Sorry to be so melodramatic,
but, um...

03:28.600 --> 03:29.828
Do you want to?

03:29.870 --> 03:31.337
No, go ahead.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.338
Jonas Stern,
about a lifetime ago,

03:36.380 --> 03:38.940
sat me down in a room,
not unlike this one,

03:38.980 --> 03:40.811
and offered me a cigar.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.408
I said no, of course.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.782
But then he said
the following--

03:44.820 --> 03:46.856
Unfortunately,
I can't do his voice.

03:46.890 --> 03:47.857
Thank God.

03:47.890 --> 03:49.426
Anyway, he said,

03:49.460 --> 03:52.827
"After I tell you
what I'm about to tell you,

03:52.860 --> 03:56.694
"I want you to go home,
take your phone off the hook

03:56.730 --> 03:57.958
"and sit for a moment.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.639
"And feel proud
of yourself.

04:00.670 --> 04:03.798
"And then I want you
to go out and get drunk.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.400
"Or do something
you would never do:

04:06.440 --> 04:08.635
"buy a sports car,
go sailing,

04:08.680 --> 04:09.840
go to the track."

04:09.880 --> 04:11.472
I did go to the track,
by the way.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.341
I went windsurfing...
unsuccessfully.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.417
(chuckles)

04:16.450 --> 04:18.839
Anyway, this moment
is your moment, Alicia.

04:18.890 --> 04:21.950
We want you to join us
as an equity partner.

04:21.990 --> 04:24.720
Oh, my God.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.751
Yes, what you've done here
is extraordinary.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.552
You're...

04:28.600 --> 04:31.797
you're kidding.
No.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.832
We want you to
join the ranks

04:33.870 --> 04:35.337
of our highest echelon.

04:35.370 --> 04:38.498
I... I don't know what to say.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.905
Say you're happy.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.009
I'm happy.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.405
(laughing)

04:42.450 --> 04:43.405
I'm...

04:43.450 --> 04:45.805
I'm relieved.

04:45.850 --> 04:49.513
You don't know what
a roller coaster this has been.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.380
And for the firm as well.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.854
It's a credit
to you, AllCla.

04:53.890 --> 04:54.857
You've been
amazmg here.

04:54.890 --> 04:55.959
Aanay, think
about it.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.526
No need to rush into it.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.994
Take until the end of the week,
and then say yes or no.

05:00.030 --> 05:00.997
Does anyone ever say no?

05:01.030 --> 05:01.928
I don't know.
I can't remember

05:01.960 --> 05:03.962
the last time
we sat an assoaate down.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.126
Well, I'm not
going to say no.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.991
(laughs) Well, give yourself
until the end of the week.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.964
And good luck
with this Mrs. Gross case.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.602
Sounds promising.

05:12.640 --> 05:13.971
Thank you.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.103
Thank you so much.

05:16.140 --> 05:19.075
Ouch.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.840
Alicia, are you
heading to bankruptcy?

05:24.890 --> 05:26.585
What?
I don't think so.

05:26.620 --> 05:27.882
(elevator bell dings)

05:27.920 --> 05:30.787
Is everything
all right?
Yes.

05:37.030 --> 05:39.863
DIANE: We have cut our debt
in half, your Honor.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.697
In five months,

05:41.740 --> 05:43.059
we have gone
from owing $60 million

05:43.110 --> 05:44.862
to owing now only 30.

05:44.910 --> 05:45.808
29.5.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.728
That is the difficulty
here, your Honor.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.998
We have a trustee who thinks
of us as a decimal point.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.712
JUDGE:
Okay, thank you.

05:52.750 --> 05:53.774
Mr. Gardner, Ms. Lockhart,

05:53.820 --> 05:55.708
you're looking for another
five-month extension?

05:55.750 --> 05:56.944
Not another
five-month extension;

05:56.990 --> 05:58.389
a single five-month
extension.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.910
But yes.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.484
Mr. Hayden,
tell me why I shouldn't

06:01.520 --> 06:03.659
extend this
fairly arbitrary deadline.

06:03.690 --> 06:06.397
Well, I didn't
think of it as arbitrary.

06:06.430 --> 06:08.523
And I would like
the creditor to advance

06:08.560 --> 06:09.993
his own argument.

06:10.030 --> 06:12.066
Mr. Canning.

06:13.940 --> 06:17.103
Your Honor, hello.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.607
I'm Louis Canning.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.905
I, uh, would like
to thank you for...

06:21.940 --> 06:24.670
taking the time
to listen to me today.

06:24.710 --> 06:25.972
I've been in
other courtrooms

06:26.010 --> 06:27.716
where the voice
of the handicapped

06:27.750 --> 06:30.981
is often shunted
aside and ignored.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.453
But not here.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.912
That's the great thing
about America.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.052
Dear God.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.626
CANNING:
These movements
that you see

06:36.660 --> 06:38.082
are called tardive
dyskrnesra.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.791
Your Honor, excuse me.
Relevance.

06:39.830 --> 06:40.956
JUDGE:
Ms. Lockhart, please.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.924
I think we can tolerate_ this
purely as an explanation.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.961
CANNING:
Thank you, Your Honor.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.695
I would argue
against this extension

06:47.740 --> 06:49.537
for one simple reason:

06:49.570 --> 06:51.868
The money that I collect
from Lockhart/Gardner

06:51.910 --> 06:53.878
will go directly
to neurological research

06:53.910 --> 06:55.798
into syndromes like my own.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.842
So, every day
payment is delayed

06:57.880 --> 06:59.199
is another day
that a child

06:59.250 --> 07:00.478
wakes up without a future.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.839
Your Honor,
Mr. Canning should be

07:01.880 --> 07:03.142
rejoicing in
our resurgence.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.748
If we're liquidated
today, he'll only

07:04.790 --> 07:06.109
receive 50 cents
on the dollar.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.584
In five months, he'll
get his full 100%.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.178
That's only if the debt
is repaid in full.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.551
Yes, which is why we intend
to present evidence

07:12.600 --> 07:14.522
showing our obligations
can be fulﬁlled

07:14.560 --> 07:15.629
in five months time.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.059
I agree.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.624
Please have your arguments

07:18.670 --> 07:19.864
ready by tomorrow.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.765
(gavel slams)

07:21.800 --> 07:23.802
WILL:
Uh-oh.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.637
Look who's
working together.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.034
MAN: I just want
to ask God for one thing...

07:29.080 --> 07:31.776
...be true,
let our minds be clear.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.119
And as we discuss
these candidates...

07:34.150 --> 07:35.913
There.
What there?
There's nothing there.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.679
Everyone's head is bowed
except for Maddie's.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.711
Come on, this
is not the South.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.751
Doesn't have to be the
South for it to resonate.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.485
Voters don't like radicals.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.020
They don't like rudeness.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.652
That is rudeness,
and it plays downstate.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.951
Eli, is Peter here?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.797
Oh, no, we had
to send him downstate

07:49.830 --> 07:51.661
at the last minute.
What do you need?

07:51.700 --> 07:52.667
Ms. Florrick,
hello.
Hello.

07:52.700 --> 07:53.997
Could you have him call me

07:54.040 --> 07:55.598
when he gets in?

07:55.640 --> 07:56.902
Sure.
Is everything all right?

07:56.940 --> 07:58.669
Yes.

07:58.710 --> 08:01.907
Alicia, uh, could I ask you
a quick question?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.703
When you were friends
with Maddie Hayward,

08:03.750 --> 08:05.672
did you ever talk
about religion?

08:05.710 --> 08:07.268
Did we ever talk
about religion?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.276
Belief in God.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.083
What'd she say?
She an agnostic?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.509
Oh, I don't know if I feel
comfortable with this, Eli.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.084
Oh, she's used
stuff you told her

08:15.120 --> 08:16.155
in confidence
against Peter.

08:16.190 --> 08:18.556
Yes, but I...

08:18.590 --> 08:20.148
She's an atheist.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.849
She told you that?

08:21.900 --> 08:22.924
It's not that weird, Eli.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.198
Oh, I know. I'm not
saying anything.

08:24.230 --> 08:25.822
But she told you
she was an atheist?

08:25.870 --> 08:27.132
Yes. Why?

08:27.170 --> 08:28.194
No reason.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.231
I'll tell Peter you came by.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.899
Ah, there you are.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.542
I was wondering
where you wandered off to.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.808
Just went on a lunch break,

08:39.850 --> 08:41.249
and bought a few things.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.714
How nice for you.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.717
Deena signed on.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.308
Gross and his lawyers
are coming over tomorrow

08:46.350 --> 08:47.317
to start negotiating.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.315
Good.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.055
And another thing--
I heard Will

08:50.090 --> 08:53.093
and Diane sat you down
and had the talk.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.688
Congratulations.
Good news.

08:54.730 --> 08:55.822
Thank you.

08:55.860 --> 08:56.929
It was unexpected.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.198
Yes, well, now,
here's the thing:

08:58.230 --> 08:59.834
They might not
have talked to you

08:59.870 --> 09:01.792
about the capital contribution.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.660
It's required
of all equity partners.

09:05.770 --> 09:07.806
that sounds like
a lot of money,

09:07.840 --> 09:09.239
but we have
reasonable terms.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.578
Usually 50% up front

09:11.610 --> 09:14.943
and another 50
deliverable upon bonuses.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.243
I'm-I'm sorry. What?

09:19.290 --> 09:21.019
The capital contribution.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.049
It's your investment
in the firm.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.251
Every equity partner
has to throw into the pot.

09:24.290 --> 09:27.054
That means you're
invested in the firm,

09:27.100 --> 09:29.250
_ the fir_m's
invested in you.

09:30.670 --> 09:34.299
Sorry... $600,000?

09:34.340 --> 09:35.693
(chuckling):
Yes, I know.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.765
It sounds like a lot of money.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.607
My God, when I was
a fourth-year,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.335
it sounded like all
the money in the world.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.348
But you only need
to put up half.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.200
The other,
with interest,

09:45.250 --> 09:47.377
is usually
payable within

09:47.420 --> 09:50.241
three bonus cycles,
maybe more,

09:50.290 --> 09:52.110
depending on how we're doing.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.186
So...

09:54.220 --> 09:55.983
any questions?

09:56.020 --> 10:01.720
Six... hundred... thousand?

10:01.760 --> 10:03.762
Yes, membership has
its privileges,

10:03.800 --> 10:05.995
but first,
you need to be a member.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.133
(chuckles)

10:07.170 --> 10:08.194
Any other questions?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.209
I...

10:11.240 --> 10:13.003
No.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.200
Good.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.346
Again, congratulations.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.391
WILL: Kalinda, just give us
a month. That's all.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.067
No.
Thanks, though.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.032
We're cash-poor at the moment.

10:43.070 --> 10:44.833
If this bankruptcy extension
goes our way,

10:44.870 --> 10:45.962
we won't be.
That's good.

10:46.010 --> 10:47.136
But, in the meantime,

10:47.180 --> 10:51.048
I was promised a promotion
and a five percent increase.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.116
You really think this
is going to work?

10:53.150 --> 10:54.742
Excuse me?

10:54.780 --> 10:56.247
Look, nothing your firm
does in that room

10:56.280 --> 10:58.089
is going to convince
me to hire you.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.008
Mr. Gross, maybe
you didn't notice,

11:00.060 --> 11:01.755
I'm in a meeting.
You are not gonna

11:01.790 --> 11:03.155
get my business, and
if you do anything

11:03.190 --> 11:05.351
to come between _me_and Deena...
I'm in litigation,

11:05.390 --> 11:06.755
not family law.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.199
I didn't solicit
your Wife's busmess,

11:08.230 --> 11:10.095
_nor am I involved
in her negotiation.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.894
So get the hell
out of my ofﬁce.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.065
You got your raise.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.771
Keep track of that.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.232
Happy to.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.173
DAVID:
Ah, here's the groom.

11:24.210 --> 11:27.145
Can we start now?
Is everybody happy?

11:27.180 --> 11:28.408
Ecstatic.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.008
Are you okay
with this?

11:30.050 --> 11:32.211
We just need to go
through the motions.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.478
Yeah. I know it makes sense.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.250
Ijust... I want you
to be comfortable, baby.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.359
Deena, why don't you
have a seat here?

11:37.390 --> 11:39.324
No, no, babe, sit here.
I'm okay here.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.726
DAVID: We just have
a few amendments to make

11:41.760 --> 11:44.820
to the fine work done
by your firm, Rochelle.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.167
We would suggest

11:46.200 --> 11:48.168
redrafting pages
two through,

11:48.200 --> 11:50.236
let's see... 68.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.363
We're fine with
the cover sheet.
We wanted

11:52.410 --> 11:54.037
to redraft anyway--
we feel like Mr. Gross

11:54.080 --> 11:56.207
is being far too
lenient financially.
(David chuckles)

11:56.240 --> 11:57.241
ALICIA:
Our first concern

11:57.280 --> 11:59.077
is jurisdiction-- Texas?

11:59.110 --> 12:01.249
Mr. Gross has a ranch
outside of Austin.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.214
And Chumhum's technical
support facility is there.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.411
CARY:
But Mr. Gross isn't--
he hasn't been there

12:05.450 --> 12:08.487
since the two-hour stopover
at DFW en route to Paris,

12:08.520 --> 12:10.351
March 2009.
That's not
dispositive.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.449
DAVID:
But this is.

12:12.490 --> 12:15.152
The couple will be domiciled
in Mountain View, California,

12:15.200 --> 12:17.020
which is the location
of Chumhum's headquarters.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.162
ALICIA:
California law
is friendlier

12:18.200 --> 12:19.098
to the more
dependent spouse.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.529
Texas is not so friendly.

12:20.570 --> 12:23.130
ROCHELLE:
Actually, Mrs. Florrick,
why don't you tell her

12:23.170 --> 12:25.206
the real reason
you want California law:

12:25.240 --> 12:28.004
it's the seven-day rule.
NEIL: What's
the seven-day rule?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.871
DAVID:
Both parties must have

12:29.910 --> 12:32.242
the final agreement in hand
for seven days before signing.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.315
ROCHELLE:
Or it's unenforceable.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.215
The prenup is voided.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.319
Our wedding's
in nine days.

12:36.350 --> 12:38.011
Exactly.
So we have

12:38.050 --> 12:40.382
48 hours to hammer this out.
DAVID: Then let's
make a deal.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.980
48 hours-- God made plants
and animals in 48 hours.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.918
ROCHELLE:
They are trying
to hold a gun

12:44.960 --> 12:47.155
to our head, Deena.
CARY: It's a gun
to both of our heads.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.189
It's equal pressure
on both parties.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.322
Yes, but which
party suffers

12:49.360 --> 12:50.827
if the prenup is altered?

12:50.870 --> 12:52.269
Both parties suffer,
given that Mr. Gross

12:52.300 --> 12:53.597
and Deena want a mutually
satisfactory agreement.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.097
(cell phone ringing)
We don't have the time
to hammer it out.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.164
CARY:
We're here to represent...

12:57.210 --> 12:59.269
DAVID: This is
absolutely ridiculous.

12:59.310 --> 13:00.971
(arguing continues)

13:01.010 --> 13:03.308
Mr. Connolly. Yes.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.239
$600,000. I know.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.477
The question is: Can I
borrow against my mortgage?

13:09.520 --> 13:11.818
A cosigner?

13:11.850 --> 13:14.011
Who's the cosigner?

13:14.060 --> 13:16.949
Oh. No, I forgot.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.288
Mr. Florrick.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.456
(arguing continues)
Look!

13:20.500 --> 13:22.024
(arguing stops)

13:22.060 --> 13:23.391
Look, this is academic.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.466
We are never going
to get a divorce.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.468
'Course not.
DAVID: No, we share
your optimism,

13:27.500 --> 13:30.867
_ but this contract _
is about worst-case scenarios.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.105
If Texas law governs...
DEENA:
It's okay.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.301
Texas law is fine.

13:35.340 --> 13:36.602
DEENA:
Let's just
move on.
Perfect.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.177
Shall we move on to spousal
support and maintenance?

13:39.210 --> 13:40.438
Uh, yes,

13:40.480 --> 13:42.846
but, uh,
it's almost noon.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.279
Why don't we pick up
after lunch.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.189
We can't_ afford
any more giveaways.

13:53.230 --> 13:54.857
David, she's
a woman in love--

13:54.900 --> 13:56.322
it's gonna be hard
to motivate her.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.920
Do you need dirt?
DAVID:
Yes.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.039
But that's the challenge
about prenups—- you need

14:00.070 --> 14:02.368
to throw enough dirt
on the spouse to get something,

14:02.400 --> 14:04.209
but not too much
to kill the wedding.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.901
I'll be delicate.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.135
MAN:
Lyman Nordquist.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.069
I am the CEO
of LOC Pharmaceuticals.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.146
Is that loud enough?

14:13.180 --> 14:14.875
It is. Thank you
for speaking up.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.014
So, you funded Mr. Canning's
trust, Encinal Equity,

14:18.050 --> 14:20.450
the one that purchased
all of our firm's debt.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.151
Is that correct?
It is.

14:22.190 --> 14:23.384
Now, help me out here.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.159
Why would a billion-
dollar conglomerate

14:25.190 --> 14:27.556
want to _control the_ debt
of a Chicago law firm?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.522
I renew my objection to
this witness, Your Honor.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.290
A creditor's mot_ive is not
relevant; only his debt IS.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.298
Mr. Canning is the one
who brought up motive,

14:34.340 --> 14:35.489
Your Honor,
by suggesting this debt

14:35.540 --> 14:37.269
was for afflicted
children.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.273
JUDGE: Are-are you
all right, Mr. Canning?

14:48.280 --> 14:50.282
I am now, sir, yes.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.255
Mr. Gardner, you're arguing
that the creditor

14:53.290 --> 14:55.918
has a biased motive_
for re5isting your exten5ion?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.257
Yes, clearly.

14:57.290 --> 14:59.485
JUDGE: Well, then,
unfortunately, Mr. Canning,

14:59.530 --> 15:01.691
I have to overrule you.
So, Mr. Nordquist,

15:01.730 --> 15:04.096
why fund the purchase
of our debt?

15:06.070 --> 15:08.288
JUDGE:
Mr. Nordquist,

15:08.340 --> 15:10.069
I must compel you to answer.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.702
(sighs heavily)

15:11.740 --> 15:15.301
Lockhart/Gardner brings costly
nuisance suits against us.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.570
WILL: Ah... so this isn't
about handicapped children.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.441
NORDQUIST:
There is nothing
either illegal

15:19.480 --> 15:21.448
or unethical in our_actions.
But Mr. Canning

15:21.480 --> 15:23.516
would never support an extension
of our debt deadline,

15:23.550 --> 15:25.347
even if it was one week.
CANNING:
Objection.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.255
Beyond the scope.
That's all right.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.552
I think it's clear
why Mr. Canning

15:28.590 --> 15:29.989
doesn't want our extension.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.385
What was that?
What was...

15:32.430 --> 15:33.499
Mr. Nordquist?

15:33.530 --> 15:36.294
He's the money who wants
what we both want.
"We"?

15:36.330 --> 15:39.458
When did we become a "we"?

15:39.500 --> 15:42.333
You're right; I'm
being presumptuous.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.008
Lockhart/Gardner
is a good firm

15:44.040 --> 15:46.361
with good people who
are being mismanaged.

15:46.410 --> 15:49.538
Now, if you agree with
that, then we are a "we."

15:49.580 --> 15:52.401
I'm not here to destroy it.
I know.

15:52.450 --> 15:54.111
You're here to make sure
the firm's creditor--

15:54.150 --> 15:55.048
myself-- gets paid,

15:55.080 --> 15:57.241
and to put a good firm
on firmer footing.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.382
That's what I want, too.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.251
You intend to be a
lawyer, Mr. Hayden.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.484
Is that right?

16:01.520 --> 16:02.714
Yes. Why?

16:02.760 --> 16:04.352
Have you passed
the bar?

16:04.390 --> 16:06.324
I take it next week.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.725
Illinois.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.398
That's a tough exam.

16:09.430 --> 16:11.421
Struggled with
that one myself.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.495
What do you intend
to do afterward?

16:13.540 --> 16:16.395
Practice the law. Why?

16:22.780 --> 16:24.407
You're kidding.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.405
(laughs)

16:25.450 --> 16:27.372
Congratulations.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.149
Thank you.

16:29.180 --> 16:32.411
(sighs)
I'm... stunned. _
I wasn't expecting it.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.156
I was; just not so soon.

16:34.190 --> 16:35.748
This is one
for the history books.

16:35.790 --> 16:37.587
Fourth year.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.053
How much is the catch?

16:40.100 --> 16:43.365
Well, the capital
contribution is $600,000.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.697
Wow.
Yeah.

16:44.730 --> 16:46.595
But I can borrow
against the mortgage.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.131
I just need you
to cosign.

16:48.170 --> 16:50.502
Why cosign?
I'll loan it to you.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.201
You...

16:52.240 --> 16:55.403
No, Peter, I haven't even
decided if I'm gonna do it.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.702
Why wouldn't you?

16:56.740 --> 16:59.345
Well... the firm,
its situation.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.575
I think I want to see
where things fall.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.247
Okay. Well, that's smart,

17:03.290 --> 17:06.487
but when you decide,
I'm fronting you the money.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.454
It's a business decision,
Alicia.

17:08.490 --> 17:11.050
It's like taking out stock,
nothing else.

17:12.090 --> 17:16.220
Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.466
Hey, Alicia.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.365
Hi.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.834
I'm Jordan.
I know.

17:21.870 --> 17:24.100
You walk fast.
I'm in a hurry.

17:24.140 --> 17:26.301
Just need a minute
with the God question.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.570
The God question?
Uh, the question of belief.

17:28.610 --> 17:29.838
What do you believe?

17:29.880 --> 17:32.348
Uh, I believe your father
was politely Anglican

17:32.380 --> 17:34.814
and your mother
was politely nothing.

17:34.850 --> 17:36.670
Am I being too personal?

17:36.720 --> 17:38.517
You're being something.
We're making an issue

17:38.550 --> 17:40.518
of Maddie Hayward's
religious beliefs,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.653
which means she's gonna
make an issue of yours.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.487
And how is she
gonna do that?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.486
At the Leadership
Forum tomorrow,

17:46.530 --> 17:49.829
we have a surrogate who'll
hit her with the atheism thing,

17:49.860 --> 17:52.658
so you may be
asked, too.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.066
So, if you don't mind,
what do you believe?

17:55.900 --> 17:58.368
(chuckling)

17:58.410 --> 18:00.139
(chuckles)

18:00.180 --> 18:02.603
Okay. We'll talk later.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.278
DAVID:
Go ahead, Cary.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.709
You're the one
who discovered it.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.547
Uh, actually,
Kalinda did.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.639
Actually, I don't care.
Someone tell them.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.841
CARY:
The shares of Chumhum

18:11.890 --> 18:14.484
that Neil Gross offered
you in the prenup,

18:14.520 --> 18:16.181
they'll be worthless
if you divorce.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.450
Why? What do you mean?
KALINDA:
The prenup has

18:18.490 --> 18:20.355
no non-dilution clause.
DAVID:
Meaning that if

18:20.400 --> 18:21.594
the shares aren't fixed

18:21.630 --> 18:23.359
at a percentage
of the company's value,

18:23.400 --> 18:26.119
Neil can keep issuing
more stocks and more stocks,

18:26.170 --> 18:28.434
and poof,
millions become pennies.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.461
I don't care.
Deena, I think you
should listen.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.568
No, Dad.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.373
Neil and I had lunch.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.173
We're ready to put
this stuff behind us.

18:35.210 --> 18:38.475
In my professional opinion...
I have made
my decision.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.375
I won't let
money gUIde me.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.274
Please shut it
down, Mr. Lee.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.582
Thank you.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.252
We're not shutting
anything down.

18:49.290 --> 18:51.520
She just needs a good
dose of reality.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.790
She said she won't
let money guide her.

18:53.830 --> 18:54.649
Yeah.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.464
So don't go after money.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.797
Okay.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.491
Good.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.531
We'll make sure
Gross and his lawyers

19:03.570 --> 19:05.709
give her a good dose of reality.

19:05.740 --> 19:08.231
Gross and his lawyers?
Live and learn,

19:08.280 --> 19:10.498
young protg, live and learn.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.615
CANNING:
Ms. Lockhart,

19:13.650 --> 19:15.743
the $30 million
you raised,

19:15.780 --> 19:17.748
does that include
the firm's take

19:17.790 --> 19:19.746
on the 16 cases
you settled?

19:19.790 --> 19:21.610
Yes. _
In the preVIous
ten years,

19:21.660 --> 19:22.615
what percentage of litigation

19:22.660 --> 19:24.525
did you settle
rather than bring to verdict?

19:24.560 --> 19:26.528
Objection. Only the firm's
conduct since bankruptcy

19:26.560 --> 19:28.494
is relevant here.
Overruled.

19:28.530 --> 19:29.554
Ms. Lockhart?

19:29.600 --> 19:32.194
I wouldn't know offhand.
I would.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.390
Less than 30%.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.737
Yet, since the firm
declared bankruptcy,

19:34.770 --> 19:36.431
it's settled 100% of its cases.

19:36.470 --> 19:37.607
Objection!
Attorney is testifying.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.538
Here's some testifying;
they're reducing

19:38.570 --> 19:40.276
the debt on the backs
of their clients.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.572
Your Honor...
It's immoral.
It's unethical.

19:41.610 --> 19:43.601
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Mr. Canning has not...

19:43.650 --> 19:45.277
(all arguing at once)

19:45.310 --> 19:46.641
If he wants a war, he's got one.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.773
Diane...
No. We're not
gonna let a mercenary

19:48.820 --> 19:50.219
like Canning get away
with smearing

19:50.250 --> 19:51.410
our reputation like that!

19:51.450 --> 19:53.759
The thing is,
we may have exposure here.

19:54.590 --> 19:55.887
Will...

19:55.920 --> 19:57.979
we have never sold out a client.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.429
Never once.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.325
I agree.
But if he has evidence

20:01.360 --> 20:03.499
contradicting your testimony...
What evidence?

20:03.530 --> 20:05.327
The Spence West Nile case.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.691
We wanted $15 million;
we dropped our ask to 12.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.264
For a very good reason.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.369
We needed the money.
No.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.559
That was a good settlement.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.599
And if he
puts someone

20:12.640 --> 20:14.437
on the stand who contradicts us?

20:14.480 --> 20:15.799
Someone who will
tell the truth,

20:15.840 --> 20:17.808
even if it hurts?
VVho?

20:17.850 --> 20:20.444
KALIN DA:
Alicia.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.572
Yes?

20:21.620 --> 20:23.212
You've been subpoenaed.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.321
We give up.
Really?

20:30.360 --> 20:32.453
That's a first.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.026
My client is amenable
to Mr. Gross's positions

20:34.060 --> 20:36.255
on all financial issues.
Great.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.528
We should do this more often

20:37.570 --> 20:39.322
with the clients
out of the room.

20:39.370 --> 20:41.429
My office will prepare
the paperwork,

20:41.470 --> 20:43.267
and we'll get it to you, yes?

20:43.310 --> 20:44.368
Actually,
there is just one thing.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.763
I thought it was too easy.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.437
Ms. Lampard would like
the document to address

20:47.480 --> 20:48.708
a number of personal
cohabitation expectations.

20:48.740 --> 20:51.379
Within reason, we'll listen.
What are they?

20:51.410 --> 20:52.877
ALICIA:
Relationship maintenance.

20:52.910 --> 20:55.310
Ms. Lampard requests
a date night each week,

20:55.350 --> 20:56.510
preferably on Fridays,

20:56.550 --> 20:59.587
to last no less than
four hours door to door.

20:59.620 --> 21:00.689
Consecutive hours?
Yes.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.518
And also Mr. Gross is required
to spend 600 minutes

21:03.560 --> 21:06.051
away from work each week.
Inclusive of the date?

21:06.090 --> 21:07.853
No. In addition.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.652
That could be problematic.
We're open to negotiation.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.997
CARY:
Children.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.065
Ms. Lampard insists

21:12.100 --> 21:14.364
that any children
will be brought up Christian.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.332
No, deal breaker.

21:15.370 --> 21:16.462
Mr. Gross is Jewish.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.637
Oh, come on.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.501
We made movement on the money.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.531
Can't give on religion.
What else are you after?

21:21.580 --> 21:22.729
Sexual maintenance.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.702
Number of times a week?

21:24.750 --> 21:25.876
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.913
We can horse-trade on that.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.713
Good.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.513
I thought we were
shutting this down.
DAVID: We were.

21:32.550 --> 21:34.415
We tried. They asked for
some additional items.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.849
Cary, why don't you?

21:36.890 --> 21:38.721
(sighs)

21:38.760 --> 21:40.352
Mr. Gross wants you
to stipulate

21:40.400 --> 21:42.322
that your children
will be raised Jewish.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.066
What?
DAVID:
Yes.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.362
We were surprised.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.039
DEENA: We never
discussed religion.

21:48.070 --> 21:49.435
Not once.

21:49.470 --> 21:50.289
His lawyers also insisted

21:50.340 --> 21:52.729
on a few relationship
bullet points.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.034
Sexual maintenance.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.401
At least twice a week,

21:57.450 --> 21:59.907
though Mr. Gross reserves
the sole discretion for more

21:59.950 --> 22:01.372
or less.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.615
He asked for that?
His lawyers did.

22:03.650 --> 22:05.447
Look, when you said stand down,

22:05.490 --> 22:07.458
his lawyers pressed
their advantage.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.412
That's the problem
with standing down.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.485
CARY:
We can push back, Deena,

22:11.530 --> 22:14.556
or you can just sign this prenup
and hope for the best,

22:14.600 --> 22:16.989
but I would push back
if I were you.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.896
Push back.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.408
Push back hard.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.135
Nicely played, Cary.

22:27.170 --> 22:28.774
Thank you, sir.

22:28.810 --> 22:30.471
You're gonna make a hell
of an equity partner.

22:31.880 --> 22:35.509
Now, you two get moving on
Gross's asset assessment.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.449
They offered you
partnership?

22:39.490 --> 22:41.481
Uh, I know,
it's funny, right?

22:41.520 --> 22:43.056
Me, too.

22:43.090 --> 22:44.557
Yeah?

22:44.590 --> 22:45.784
I was wondering
if they did.

22:45.830 --> 22:47.491
Congratulations.

22:47.530 --> 22:50.624
I think they were counting
my years before I left,

22:50.670 --> 22:52.422
not just the last
seven months.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.461
Yeah, you're probably right.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.468
So...

22:56.500 --> 22:58.502
Congratulations, partner.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.548
DIANE:
Alicia?

23:07.580 --> 23:10.413
Do you have a moment?

23:10.450 --> 23:12.486
Any idea why you
were subpoenaed?

23:12.520 --> 23:14.158
No.

23:14.190 --> 23:17.455
WILL:
We were wondering if it was
about the West Nile case.

23:17.490 --> 23:19.128
Canning faced you
on that.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.424
Maybe.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.718
Well, the recession
has worsened

23:24.770 --> 23:26.465
this past year.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.492
Even clients with good cases
have had cash flow issues.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.735
Meaning the percentage of cases
we've settled has increased.

23:31.770 --> 23:33.431
Which leads to the
absurd suggestion

23:33.480 --> 23:34.902
that we pushed our
clients to settle

23:34.940 --> 23:36.202
so we could get paid.
We just want

23:36.240 --> 23:37.741
to make sure
we're all on the same page

23:37.780 --> 23:39.099
with our testimony.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.745
I think so.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.214
Good.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.514
Good. That's all.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.050
Oh, and did you go out
and do something special?

23:49.090 --> 23:50.648
Celebrate?

23:50.690 --> 23:53.488
Yes, I did.

23:54.930 --> 23:56.955
(door opens)

23:57.000 --> 23:58.558
(door closes)

24:00.600 --> 24:02.966
So, where are you
on belief in God?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.560
(laughs)

24:05.610 --> 24:06.634
What?

24:06.670 --> 24:08.479
It's for the campaign.

24:08.510 --> 24:09.579
Yes, I know.

24:09.610 --> 24:11.009
Your friend, Jordan,
already asked me.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.472
He was here?

24:12.510 --> 24:14.011
No, at the campaign bus.

24:14.050 --> 24:15.847
Oh. What did you say?

24:15.880 --> 24:18.189
I said it's personal.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.586
For him, right?
But not for us.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.554
(chuckles)
Great.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.228
Thought so.
Do you have a minute?

24:24.260 --> 24:26.524
So, that's almost
a belief in God.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.596
How is that
almost a belief in God?

24:28.630 --> 24:30.120
I have a husband
who believes in God

24:30.160 --> 24:31.593
and a daughter who might...
Yes.

24:31.630 --> 24:33.063
And what about Zach?
I don't know.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.237
But I don't.
But the point is

24:34.270 --> 24:35.669
you could believe in God.

24:35.700 --> 24:36.894
But I don't.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.761
Yes, but if Jesus were to show
up in your office right now,

24:39.810 --> 24:41.175
you'd believe in him,
wouldn't you?

24:41.210 --> 24:42.108
No.

24:42.140 --> 24:44.176
Yes, you would-- if he
performed a miracle.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.701
Well, if Jesus walked
into my office

24:46.750 --> 24:48.877
right now and performed
a miracle, then yes,

24:48.920 --> 24:50.717
I would believe in God.
Good. See?

24:50.750 --> 24:51.842
You're a seeker.

24:51.890 --> 24:52.914
(chuckles)

24:52.950 --> 24:55.259
Alicia, I know
this sounds stupid,

24:55.290 --> 24:57.554
but voters hate atheists.

24:57.590 --> 24:59.581
They think they spend
all their time fighting mangers

24:59.630 --> 25:01.291
outside city hall.

25:01.330 --> 25:02.752
They want people
who are open-minded,

25:02.800 --> 25:04.267
and you are open-minded.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.599
Okay, is that
what you want me to say?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.789
I want you

25:08.840 --> 25:10.535
to be Saint Alicia.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.299
It's a selling
point for Peter,

25:12.340 --> 25:13.978
and voters don't want to think
Saint Alicia's an atheist.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.308
Okay.

25:16.340 --> 25:20.549
So Diane and Will negotiated
in good faith,

25:20.580 --> 25:22.548
Cary is as
deserving as I am,

25:22.580 --> 25:24.810
and God might exist.

25:24.850 --> 25:27.148
I'm good.

25:27.190 --> 25:29.283
Yeah, I don't know
what that was about, but...

25:29.320 --> 25:31.527
yes!

25:33.030 --> 25:35.055
Jordan...

25:35.100 --> 25:37.056
What did you think of him?

25:37.100 --> 25:38.795
He's...

25:38.830 --> 25:40.593
awloNard.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.631
He is, isn't he?

25:42.670 --> 25:44.661
Not a bad thing
to mention to Peter.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.529
Okay.

25:45.570 --> 25:47.208
Just one scripted line
per day, please.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.174
Right, okay.
I'm out of here.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.848
Oh, my God.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.711
DAVID:
Well, if he's not
going to do it,

25:53.750 --> 25:55.775
at least memorialize
his intent!

25:55.820 --> 25:57.742
He's not memorializing
anything.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.018
CARY:
Except outrageous
personal demands.

25:59.050 --> 26:01.314
ROCHELLE: David, this is not
an IPO; it's a prenup.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.713
DAVID:
What, do you think
I'm an idiot?

26:02.760 --> 26:03.988
Of course it's not.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.123
MR. LAMPARD:
The p0int is my daughter
is entitled to protection.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.354
You shouldn't even be
in the room.

26:07.390 --> 26:08.994
Please _do not talk
to my client's father.

26:09.030 --> 26:10.668
My God,
this is so silly!

26:10.700 --> 26:13.965
(sighs)
Deena, I'm not gonna dilute
your stock options.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.935
And when did you start worrying
about stock options?

26:16.970 --> 26:18.005
Wait a minute,
when did you?

26:18.040 --> 26:19.337
I'm talking to my fiance.

26:19.370 --> 26:22.828
Look, this is contract language,
baby, that's all.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.972
It's about precedent.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.272
If I give you more,

26:25.310 --> 26:28.108
then every future contract
will ask for more.

26:28.150 --> 26:30.914
You mean every future prenup
after you divorce me.

26:30.950 --> 26:33.748
You know what,
thatsit

26:33.790 --> 26:35.280
We're clone.
That's fine, Neil.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.480
You never loved me.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.057
All you wanted me to do was
spread my legs twice a week

26:39.090 --> 26:40.284
and breed your children.

26:40.330 --> 26:41.649
Okay, okay,

26:41.700 --> 26:42.951
everybody sit down.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.093
Would you go after her?

26:45.130 --> 26:47.394
The point is you love him.

26:47.430 --> 26:48.362
Don't you love him?

26:48.400 --> 26:51.267
But everything he's done--
the stock options...

26:51.310 --> 26:53.301
But you said you don't
care about the money.

26:53.340 --> 26:55.274
I don't; he does.
That's the point.

26:55.310 --> 26:57.676
It's not what I care about;
it's what he cares about.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.010
You know what I think, Deena?

27:02.050 --> 27:03.711
I think you should go to him.
No.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.287
Yes. Just call him,

27:06.320 --> 27:07.856
say you want to have dinner,

27:07.890 --> 27:09.414
no lawyers in the room.

27:09.460 --> 27:13.055
All _of this was
movmg too fast.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.250
The more Neil spends
time with you,

27:14.300 --> 27:16.689
the less he'll care about the
money, I promise you that.

27:16.730 --> 27:18.664
And we're the ones who
are pushing the money.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.764
CARY:
You two,

27:23.810 --> 27:25.766
you need to pull
each other past it.

27:31.810 --> 27:34.643
(bottle pops open,
pills rattling)

27:36.820 --> 27:38.811
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

27:38.850 --> 27:40.715
Hello, Mr. Canning.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.387
We recently faced each other

27:42.420 --> 27:44.888
in a case involving
the West Nile virus, didn't we?

27:44.930 --> 27:46.955
We did. Good to
see you again.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.127
And you.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.650
Seems we all made it back okay.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.764
My client settled that,
didn't he?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.165
He did.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.736
$12 million.

27:55.770 --> 27:58.864
And to your knowledge,
was the decision by your firm

27:58.910 --> 28:00.468
to settle that case
driven at all

28:00.510 --> 28:02.307
by its need to raise capital?

28:02.340 --> 28:04.774
It was driven _
by our client's de5ire

28:04.810 --> 28:06.175
to avoid protracted litigation.

28:06.210 --> 28:08.178
So that would be a no?

28:08.220 --> 28:10.142
That would be
a categorical no.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.386
A categorical no?

28:11.420 --> 28:13.786
That's...
that's a really big no.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.014
The biggest.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.016
And to your knowledge, has
your firm ever settled any case

28:17.060 --> 28:18.857
in the past five months
with the reduction of its debt

28:18.890 --> 28:20.050
as a consideration?

28:20.090 --> 28:21.193
No.

28:21.230 --> 28:22.322
Mrs. Florrick,

28:22.360 --> 28:23.793
did you meet with Mr. Gardner

28:23.830 --> 28:24.728
and Miss Lockhart in preparation

28:24.770 --> 28:26.362
for your testimony here today?
Objection.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.389
I'll allow.

28:27.430 --> 28:28.294
Yes,

28:28.340 --> 28:30.490
but only to discuss
my responsibility

28:30.540 --> 28:32.167
to answer
your questions truthfully.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.007
Mrs. Florrick,
are you aware of any schemes

28:34.040 --> 28:36.031
perpetrated by your firm
to reduce its debt?

28:36.080 --> 28:37.331
Objection as to vagueness.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.472
I'm quite certain
Mrs. Florrick knows

28:38.510 --> 28:39.841
what "scheme" means.

28:39.880 --> 28:40.744
I'll allow.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.509
I'm aware of no such scheme.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.415
You were recently offered
a partnership

28:44.450 --> 28:46.338
at Lockhart/Gardner,
is that right?

28:46.390 --> 28:48.051
Yes.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.250
And how much will that cost you?

28:49.290 --> 28:51.121
Objection: relevance.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.184
Overruled.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.118
My buy-in
to the firm

28:54.160 --> 28:55.957
is $600,000.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.797
You're a fourth-year associate,
is that right?

28:57.830 --> 28:58.865
Correct.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.094
Does it seem
odd to you

29:00.130 --> 29:01.939
that a fourth-year associate
should be offered a partnership?

29:01.970 --> 29:04.404
Yes.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.839
AndisnTit
oddersﬁH

29:05.870 --> 29:07.508
that five associates
at Lockhart/Gardner,

29:07.540 --> 29:10.304
all fourth-year associates,
should be offered partnerships?

29:12.880 --> 29:14.871
Oh, I'm sorry.
You weren't aware.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.138
Five associates
at Lockhart/Gardner

29:17.180 --> 29:18.886
were offered
partnerships.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.444
Is that your question?

29:20.490 --> 29:21.514
Did I know that?

29:21.560 --> 29:22.811
For a start, sure.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.928
No, I did not know that.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.382
And were you aware
that your firm

29:27.430 --> 29:29.557
is trying to raise millions
of dollars to pay off its debt

29:29.600 --> 29:30.862
by naming five partners?

29:30.900 --> 29:32.197
Objection:
asked and answered.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.993
JUDGE:
Sustained.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.860
There's no scheme, Mr. Canning.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.266
Unless you consider
the promotion of someone

29:38.310 --> 29:41.529
who has billed
thousands of hours

29:41.580 --> 29:45.505
and helped win dozens of cases
a scheme.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.245
I have nothing further.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.339
JUDGE:
Mr. Gardner?

29:49.380 --> 29:51.382
Witness may step down.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.364
(indistinct chatter)

30:18.910 --> 30:20.969
ELI:
Alicia, there you are.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.976
You look fantastic.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.578
Thanks.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.087
You okay?

30:27.120 --> 30:28.951
Is everything...?

30:28.990 --> 30:30.252
Good, yeah, great.

30:30.290 --> 30:32.178
Just let me know
when you want me

30:32.230 --> 30:33.481
to say I believe in God, Eli.

30:33.530 --> 30:35.088
Uh, okay,

30:35.130 --> 30:37.052
I don't think that's quite
the way to handle this.

30:37.100 --> 30:40.558
Alicia, I think we
should become friends.

30:40.600 --> 30:41.897
Why?

30:41.940 --> 30:43.089
Political wives
tend to like me.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.630
I keep them in the loop.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.137
Do you believe in God?

30:46.170 --> 30:47.239
Do I believe in God?

30:47.270 --> 30:48.077
I don't...
I don't know. Why?

30:48.110 --> 30:50.101
That seems to _be
the question du jour.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.109
I believe in rainbows
and little kids' smiles.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.515
That help?

30:56.080 --> 30:57.445
Alicia, it's been
a long time.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.448
Yep.

30:59.490 --> 31:02.209
You have any new friends?

31:03.930 --> 31:05.955
Just so you know, Alicia,

31:05.990 --> 31:06.957
I didn't break off
our friendship,

31:06.990 --> 31:09.220
and if you could let go
of this victimhood pose

31:09.260 --> 31:10.352
that you're hanging on to...

31:10.400 --> 31:12.288
You know what you
can do with your vic...

31:12.330 --> 31:14.161
Hey, there you are.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.168
Hello, Peter.
How are you?

31:16.200 --> 31:17.360
Good.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.004
Looking like one
debate, I see.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.530
Looks like it.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.401
Everything okay here?

31:22.440 --> 31:23.998
Just grand, darling.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.439
You know, I would love to get
you in the bathroom and...

31:26.480 --> 31:28.448
WOMAN:
Mr. State's Attorney, hello.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.311
Any reservations about
sharing the spotlight

31:30.350 --> 31:32.318
with Miss Hayward in
another campaign event?

31:32.350 --> 31:33.988
None at all.

31:34.020 --> 31:36.113
And by the way,
this is not a campaign event.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.957
I'm here to honor
the 20th anniversary

31:37.990 --> 31:39.184
of the leadership forum.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.527
It's a campaign event.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.596
Miss Hayward,
how do you respond

31:42.630 --> 31:44.222
to the controversy
over your actions

31:44.270 --> 31:45.999
at last week's
benediction?

31:46.030 --> 31:47.395
My actions?

31:47.430 --> 31:51.002
You mean the video on the Web
of me not bowing?

31:51.040 --> 31:52.029
Yes, during prayer.

31:52.070 --> 31:53.207
There's been some chatter

31:53.240 --> 31:54.207
about your
insensitivity.

31:54.240 --> 31:57.209
Well, I apologize
if it seemed insensitive.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.299
I was just trying
to avoid being hypocritical.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.703
I am an atheist.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.240
Really?

32:02.280 --> 32:04.214
Don't you worry
about how that will play

32:04.250 --> 32:07.185
in a state where only 15%
call themselves nonreligious?

32:07.220 --> 32:10.417
I worry about everything,
um, but I am who I am,

32:10.460 --> 32:12.485
and I don't think you
should run away from that.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.259
Let's just let
the voters decide.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.325
And what about you,
Mr. State's Attorney?

32:16.360 --> 32:18.362
I respect Maddie's
point of view.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.265
But you don't
share it?

32:20.300 --> 32:21.369
Well, it's different.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.662
I was in prison.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.167
Belief means a
great deal there.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.337
In fact, sometimes it was
the only thing we had.

32:26.370 --> 32:27.974
And your wife?

32:28.010 --> 32:30.274
Oh, well, I...

32:30.310 --> 32:33.541
I think my wife can
speak for herself.

32:33.580 --> 32:36.014
I'm an atheist.

32:40.420 --> 32:44.220
Nothing in Chumhum's
2011 10-K, either.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.581
Check the footnotes.

32:46.630 --> 32:50.122
Accountants, they hide problems
in their footnotes.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.422
Footnotes.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.463
I heard that you were
offered partnership.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.365
Yeah.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.107
Me, Alicia and
three others.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.233
Well, congratulations.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.406
What?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.544
They need the money.

33:05.580 --> 33:08.276
They're just handing out
partnerships like Popsicles.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.719
Popsicles?

33:09.750 --> 33:11.718
I don't know; it's late.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.786
So, you going to take it?

33:13.820 --> 33:16.288
The Popsicle?

33:16.320 --> 33:18.288
If I can get the
draw together, sure.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.299
Oh, you just feel sorry
for yourself

33:21.330 --> 33:23.093
because you were
offered something.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.467
Hey.
What?

33:30.070 --> 33:31.799
Check out the 2010 expenditures.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.274
The footnote,
under "miscellaneous," there.

33:34.310 --> 33:37.700
You see the off-balance-sheet
joint venture for $112,000?

33:37.740 --> 33:39.378
Yeah.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.548
It's in the 2009 10-K, too.

33:42.580 --> 33:45.344
Well, there's your dirt.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.540
I'll tell David Lee.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.057
(elevator bell dings)

33:54.460 --> 33:55.449
Mr. Hayden?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.718
Cary.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.625
May I help you?

33:59.670 --> 34:02.332
No, uh... (sighs)

34:02.370 --> 34:03.439
I don't know.

34:03.470 --> 34:07.201
No, I... I...
(sighs quietly)

34:07.240 --> 34:09.208
No.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.207
(laughs)

34:10.240 --> 34:11.343
Are you sure?

34:13.110 --> 34:16.375
I don't like mess;
I like precision.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.444
I know.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.415
This is mess, and I'm not sure
how to handle it.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.554
What is... what is mess?

34:22.590 --> 34:27.550
This, this... business
with Louis Canning.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.390
Oh, well.

34:32.430 --> 34:35.399
Hey, you have the bar exam
this week, don't you?

34:35.440 --> 34:37.192
Yes, I do.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.400
Good luck.
(laughs)

34:38.440 --> 34:41.273
Thank you.

34:41.310 --> 34:43.505
But I don't know,
I've come to not like the law.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.373
It's not very precise.

34:46.410 --> 34:49.311
(elevator bell dings)
It can be; it just depends
on the way you practice it.

34:52.350 --> 34:55.114
(sighs)

34:55.160 --> 34:56.218
You're right.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.148
It can be.

35:00.830 --> 35:01.854
Mr. Hayden...

35:01.900 --> 35:04.460
I'm sorry.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.491
About before,
testifying the way I did,

35:06.530 --> 35:08.168
against you, in that bankruptcy
mediation, I just...

35:08.200 --> 35:11.306
Why? It was the truth.

35:22.350 --> 35:24.818
I've been subpoenaed in court.

35:24.850 --> 35:27.239
DAVID: I appreciate that
we're all back at the table.

35:27.290 --> 35:28.416
Mazel tov.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.518
But I'm not sure
what the point is,

35:29.560 --> 35:30.754
if he's not willing
to negotiate.

35:30.790 --> 35:34.191
Maybe you could ease up
on some of your demands.
(laughing)

35:34.230 --> 35:35.891
Mmm. Deena, Mr. Lampard,

35:35.930 --> 35:37.898
would you mind
stepping out a moment?

35:37.930 --> 35:39.420
Why?
Believe me, sir,

35:39.470 --> 35:40.425
it's in your daughter's
best interest.

35:40.470 --> 35:41.437
DEENA:
I don't mind.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.233
Don't get lonely.

35:43.270 --> 35:44.669
I won't.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.298
Okay, what have you got?

35:51.350 --> 35:53.204
I was reviewing
Chumhum's SEC filings,

35:53.250 --> 35:55.548
and there's a recurring
joint venture expense,

35:55.580 --> 35:58.947
hidden in a footnote,
for $112,000.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.515
I take exception
to the adjective "hidden."

36:01.560 --> 36:03.414
(laughing):
A valuation challenge
for 100 grand?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.825
David, seriously.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.282
The joint venture

36:06.330 --> 36:08.525
is a Rhode Island LLC
called JC Partners.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.825
And its one beneficiary
is Jacob Carlisle.

36:11.870 --> 36:15.328
That's the four-year-old
son of Dara Carlisle,

36:15.370 --> 36:17.634
the woman that Mr. Gross
had a one-night stand with,

36:17.670 --> 36:20.639
in Greensboro in 2008
at a shareholders' meeting.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.346
ROCHELLE: So what's the threat?
Cough up the money,

36:25.380 --> 36:26.540
or you'll tell your client?

36:26.580 --> 36:28.468
We don't know.
We thought we'd discuss it.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.647
Extortion? Not even you
would sink that low.
Sure I would.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.580
I'm going to call
the State's Attorney's Office.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.882
You're going to forfeit
your license.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.887
NEIL:
Rochelle, just stop.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.456
Neil, no.

36:36.490 --> 36:37.855
That's... this...
I'll give...

36:39.630 --> 36:40.858
Give them what they want.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.897
DAVID:
Isn't that sweet?

36:48.940 --> 36:50.931
Young love.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.499
CANNING:
So, Mr. Hayden...

36:56.540 --> 36:58.770
you probably had
the best available view

36:58.810 --> 36:59.947
of all the shenanigans
at Lockhart/Gardner...

36:59.980 --> 37:00.969
Objection.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.671
As to shenanigans...
I'll rephrase.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.017
You had the best view

37:04.050 --> 37:05.813
of all the goings-on
at Lockhart/Gardner?

37:05.850 --> 37:07.841
Well... I was the trustee.

37:07.890 --> 37:09.585
Were you aware of the decision

37:09.620 --> 37:11.019
to offer partnerships
to five associates?

37:11.060 --> 37:12.789
Yes.

37:12.830 --> 37:14.957
And were you in agreement
with that business decision?

37:17.860 --> 37:19.498
CANNING:
Mr. Hayden?

37:21.400 --> 37:22.196
I was not.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.606
Financial commitments
to partners

37:24.640 --> 37:25.800
are one of the causes

37:25.840 --> 37:27.467
of the firm's bankruptcy.

37:27.510 --> 37:29.000
Minting new partners
is not a solution.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.769
They were doing it
to raise money.

37:30.810 --> 37:31.902
Objection.
JUDGE: Sustained.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.474
CANNING:
Let me try it this way:

37:33.510 --> 37:34.716
If each of those
new partners met

37:34.750 --> 37:36.570
their capital
contribution obligation,

37:36.620 --> 37:37.814
how much money would
Lockhart/Gardner raise?

37:37.850 --> 37:39.386
$3 million.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.887
So, if allocated towards
repayment of the debt,

37:40.920 --> 37:44.686
it would give the illusion
of financial progress, right?

37:44.730 --> 37:45.685
CLARKE:
Yes.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.482
CANNING: So the large
number of offers can only

37:47.530 --> 37:49.054
be explained as a...
as a pyramid scheme.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.852
Wait, no, no,
strike that.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.720
In this context,
how would you characterize

37:52.770 --> 37:56.467
the offer of employment
in exchange for money?

37:56.500 --> 38:00.061
Your description,
while crude, is apt.

38:00.110 --> 38:02.476
It's a type of pyramid scheme.

38:02.510 --> 38:03.579
And isn't a job
being dangled

38:03.610 --> 38:07.842
in this quid pro quo
sort of way... extraordinary?

38:07.880 --> 38:08.744
No, I'm afraid not.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.816
It's not?
Why is it not?

38:10.850 --> 38:12.044
Well...

38:12.090 --> 38:15.480
just the other day, you offered
me employment in exchange...

38:15.520 --> 38:17.351
Let's move on.
Objection.

38:17.390 --> 38:18.357
Let the witness answer.

38:18.390 --> 38:19.459
The answer is irrelevant.

38:19.490 --> 38:20.684
The answer was incomplete.

38:20.730 --> 38:22.891
When it is complete, the judge
can decide if it's relevant.

38:22.930 --> 38:25.091
Ms. Lockhart,
please let me do my job.

38:25.130 --> 38:28.839
Go ahead and complete
your answer, Mr. Hayden.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.497
I was saying,
just the other day,

38:30.540 --> 38:31.962
you offered me employment,
Mr. Canning,

38:32.010 --> 38:35.502
in exchange for continued help
in these proceedings.

38:35.540 --> 38:37.770
Move to strike as nonresponsive.

38:37.810 --> 38:38.947
Overruled.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.538
I think it was
perfectly responsive.

38:40.580 --> 38:43.549
CANNING:
Under oath, sir,
did I ever make

38:43.580 --> 38:44.786
an offer of employment to you,

38:44.820 --> 38:46.811
contingent upon your assistance
in this hearing?

38:46.850 --> 38:48.010
No, but the clear import
was that...

38:48.050 --> 38:49.859
No further questions.

38:49.890 --> 38:53.678
What, exactly,
did Mr. Canning offer you?

38:53.730 --> 38:56.358
He intimated there would be
a job for me at his law firm

38:56.400 --> 38:57.526
when these proceedings
were over.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.619
And, uh, just prior
to that intimation,

38:59.670 --> 39:02.696
did he ask you for assistance
in this matter?

39:02.740 --> 39:03.695
Yes.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.766
He requested detailed
information about cases.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.845
Thank you, Mr. Hayden.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.871
You're welcome.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.845
WILL:
Five-month extension.

39:18.890 --> 39:19.914
That gives us breathing room.

39:19.950 --> 39:21.952
DAVID: And Mrs. Gross is
thinking about assigning us

39:21.990 --> 39:24.584
her entire Midwest
book of business.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.621
The tide is turning.

39:26.660 --> 39:30.096
The vultures from Real Estate
are hoovering up all the shrimp.

39:30.130 --> 39:32.018
Mr. Gardner, Ms. Lockhart.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.890
Mr. Hayden.

39:33.930 --> 39:36.433
We don't know what to say...
except thank you.

39:36.470 --> 39:38.938
Though I confess I don't
understand your motivation.

39:38.970 --> 39:41.768
Well, I don't agree with
how your run your business,

39:41.810 --> 39:45.041
but you paid me the compliment
of not assuming I was for sale.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.469
Good luck
with the bar next week.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.478
Thank you.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.080
It has been interesting here.

39:52.120 --> 39:56.079
I don't know if I'll miss it,
but I'll...

39:57.560 --> 39:59.482
No, I won't miss it.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.624
CANNING:
And they ate and
drank and made merry.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.059
All save poor little Cinderella,

40:04.100 --> 40:05.988
who toiled amidst the reverie.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.122
Mr. Canning,

40:07.170 --> 40:09.764
I thought you'd be off
somewhere, licking your wounds.

40:09.800 --> 40:10.835
(chuckles)

40:10.870 --> 40:13.737
I'm a quick healer.

40:13.770 --> 40:16.102
No, I just came by to
sign the extension.

40:16.140 --> 40:19.177
Mr. Canning, you're not here
to sign any extension.

40:20.950 --> 40:22.975
You know what the best thing
about Monopoly is?

40:23.020 --> 40:24.817
The "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

40:24.850 --> 40:25.839
I used to love
hoarding that card

40:25.890 --> 40:27.915
'cause you never knew
when you might need it.

40:27.950 --> 40:28.917
Mr. Canning, please.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.154
I hate these stories.

40:30.190 --> 40:32.488
Whatever it is you need
to say, just say it.

40:32.530 --> 40:33.679
I don't need the story.

40:37.030 --> 40:38.964
This...

40:39.000 --> 40:41.059
is your
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

40:50.210 --> 40:51.575
DIANE:
What did he want?

40:52.750 --> 40:54.877
Mr. Canning?

40:54.920 --> 40:56.547
It was a personal matter.
Nothing important.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.616
Well, I'm here
on a professional one.

40:58.650 --> 41:00.880
Your absence
from the festivities

41:00.920 --> 41:04.083
is sending quite a message
to the partnership.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.055
Uh, what message would that be?

41:07.090 --> 41:09.729
That you're not vested
in our little enterprise.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.069
(laughs)

41:12.100 --> 41:13.021
You're pouting.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.162
It's unbecoming.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.189
No.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.094
I'm working.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.136
You know why I was made partner?

41:20.170 --> 41:24.038
Jonas Stern was sued
for sexual harassment,

41:24.080 --> 41:26.901
and he needed to show
that he had a female partner.

41:26.950 --> 41:28.941
That's all.

41:28.980 --> 41:31.517
When the door that you
have been knocking at

41:31.550 --> 41:32.744
finally swings open,

41:32.790 --> 41:36.009
you don't ask why;
you run through.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.982
That is the simple fact.

41:38.020 --> 41:40.887
No one is here to make it
comfortable for you;

41:40.930 --> 41:43.057
no one is here to appreciate
your moping,

41:43.100 --> 41:45.796
so this is my
advice to you:

41:45.830 --> 41:47.297
Take a minute
for yourself,

41:47.330 --> 41:49.594
put on your best
gracious voice,

41:49.640 --> 41:51.562
find a way to wear a smile,

41:51.610 --> 41:53.259
and then come into
the conference room

41:53.310 --> 41:55.130
ready to thank
the equity partners

41:55.180 --> 41:58.138
for giving you
this opportunity.

41:58.180 --> 42:02.071
Because what is given can
quickly be taken away.

42:23.770 --> 42:25.169
Thank you, Will.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.166
Thank you, David,
for giving me

42:27.210 --> 42:29.132
this great opportunity
to become a partner.

42:29.180 --> 42:29.908
I won't disappoint you.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.749
We know you won't.
You're welcome.

42:31.780 --> 42:33.247
DAVID:
Just you remember one thing:

42:33.280 --> 42:35.942
It's all about
client maintenance.

42:40.050 --> 42:43.611
Thank you, Diane, for thinking
of me for this position.

42:43.660 --> 42:45.025
I won't disappoint you.

42:45.060 --> 42:46.129
Good.

42:46.160 --> 42:46.979
Well, you haven't
in the past,

42:47.030 --> 42:49.055
and we know you won't
in the future.

42:54.130 --> 42:56.769
_ ALICIA:
I just want to say
thank you so much

42:56.800 --> 42:58.028
for this opportunity.
Thank you.

42:58.070 --> 43:00.038
I will not
disappoint you.

43:00.070 --> 43:01.833
I know you won't.
Thank you.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.632
ALICIA:
I'm very much
looking forward to it.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.705
What a wonderful,
wonderful thing.
Congratulations.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.945
Thank you,
again, so much.
