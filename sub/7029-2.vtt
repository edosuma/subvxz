WEBVTT

00:00.440 --> 00:02.719
Previously on the curse of Oak Island

00:02.719 --> 00:05.380
we've got tunnels we've got gold we've

00:05.380 --> 00:08.910
got silver rubies diamonds x marks the

00:08.910 --> 00:10.450
spot right there that's the gold

00:10.450 --> 00:12.999
signature we need to cut the riser pipe

00:12.999 --> 00:16.490
there's a lot of stuff on the bottle

00:16.490 --> 00:18.960
it's to the right there that's the post

00:18.960 --> 00:21.880
we did some really good sonar we can see

00:21.880 --> 00:23.990
it's a man-made object is it possible

00:23.990 --> 00:26.320
chest really we did find something

00:26.320 --> 00:28.590
unique it sits right here there's an

00:28.590 --> 00:31.930
object down there that looks like human

00:31.930 --> 00:33.980
remains

00:33.980 --> 00:37.420
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:37.420 --> 00:39.190
where people have been looking for an

00:39.190 --> 00:42.350
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:42.350 --> 00:45.890
years so far they have found bits of

00:45.890 --> 00:49.479
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:49.479 --> 00:52.909
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:52.909 --> 00:56.729
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:56.729 --> 01:00.379
have died trying to solve the mystery

01:00.379 --> 01:04.170
and according to legend one more will

01:04.170 --> 01:16.390
have to die before the treasure can be

01:16.390 --> 01:21.260
found

01:21.260 --> 01:28.390
four brothers Rick and Marty lagina the

01:28.390 --> 01:31.100
lifelong dream to solve the Oak Island

01:31.100 --> 01:34.140
mystery may finally become a reality

01:34.140 --> 01:37.170
let's be careful with this yeah let's

01:37.170 --> 01:39.110
get it done roll off that edge because

01:39.110 --> 01:40.110
that would be

01:40.110 --> 01:45.750
look at this guy's it's a rectangular

01:45.750 --> 01:48.350
object after completing this series of

01:48.350 --> 01:50.920
sonar tests which indicated that

01:50.920 --> 01:54.380
everything from wooden posts chests

01:54.380 --> 01:57.560
man-made tunnels and even a dead body

01:57.560 --> 01:59.530
might be lying at the bottom of the

01:59.530 --> 02:04.080
235-foot deep borehole known as 10x they

02:04.080 --> 02:06.530
are more determined than ever to send a

02:06.530 --> 02:09.090
diver down to the bottom to find out if

02:09.090 --> 02:10.639
the test results are true

02:10.639 --> 02:17.420
but getting to the bottom of 10-x will

02:17.420 --> 02:20.890
be both expensive and dangerous as more

02:20.890 --> 02:23.890
than 40 years of harsh weather churning

02:23.890 --> 02:26.830
saltwater and falling debris have taken

02:26.830 --> 02:29.220
their toll if we're gonna get to the

02:29.220 --> 02:30.870
bottom of 10-x we had to get the junk

02:30.870 --> 02:34.090
out of it there's a bunch of stuff

02:34.090 --> 02:35.620
laying in the bottom of the hole we

02:35.620 --> 02:38.120
don't even know what it is but the first

02:38.120 --> 02:39.450
things to remove are all the things

02:39.450 --> 02:41.560
sticking up from the bottom that come

02:41.560 --> 02:44.880
either to the top or near the top we're

02:44.880 --> 02:46.490
gonna venture back down that hole those

02:46.490 --> 02:47.950
things have to be there to remove the

02:47.950 --> 02:51.480
obstructions yes all right these are

02:51.480 --> 02:53.530
arranged reasonably well yeah let's just

02:53.530 --> 02:54.910
play it right across and we'll put two

02:54.910 --> 02:57.590
screws into that to hold it

02:57.590 --> 03:01.040
over the railways oh yeah before

03:01.040 --> 03:03.790
clearing out 10x the team must first

03:03.790 --> 03:06.130
secure the working platform that has

03:06.130 --> 03:08.400
been constructed over the 8 foot wide

03:08.400 --> 03:10.290
hole we want people to be as safe as

03:10.290 --> 03:12.600
possible but also they could be able to

03:12.600 --> 03:14.950
see you know the various pipes and

03:14.950 --> 03:16.599
things

03:16.599 --> 03:22.459
an 8 inch wide riser pipe one of three

03:22.459 --> 03:24.220
placed there over the years to pump

03:24.220 --> 03:27.160
water out of the hole will be the first

03:27.160 --> 03:28.849
to be removed

03:28.849 --> 03:31.239
that's enough to get audited but since

03:31.239 --> 03:34.370
the pipe is approximately 180 feet long

03:34.370 --> 03:38.040
a boom truck with a 100-foot crane has

03:38.040 --> 03:42.160
been brought in to lift it up okay it

03:42.160 --> 03:44.180
will then be held in place with steel

03:44.180 --> 03:49.800
bracing also known as ears

03:49.800 --> 03:52.760
finally it will be cut with a welding

03:52.760 --> 03:57.959
torch and taken away in 20-foot sections

03:57.959 --> 03:59.680
yeah here's the deal guys I think you

03:59.680 --> 04:02.220
should clear off there if that chain

04:02.220 --> 04:03.220
breaks it's gonna spring

04:03.220 --> 04:08.750
would get

04:08.750 --> 04:34.500
I don't think he don't get it well one

04:34.500 --> 04:43.880
thing's for sure Tinian hydrate

04:43.880 --> 04:46.870
anhydride or anhydrous calcium sulfate

04:46.870 --> 04:49.880
he's a hard rock like substance usually

04:49.880 --> 04:52.370
formed by the evaporation of salt water

04:52.370 --> 04:57.730
when digging 10x in the 1970s treasure

04:57.730 --> 04:59.960
hunter dan Blankenship had to drill

04:59.960 --> 05:02.380
through approximately 44 feet of it

05:02.380 --> 05:05.630
before reaching what he believes is a 10

05:05.630 --> 05:06.630
foot high

05:06.630 --> 05:11.630
man-made treasure chamber

05:11.630 --> 05:14.810
if the drill pipe is stuck in anhydride

05:14.810 --> 05:16.810
it will be even more difficult to remove

05:16.810 --> 05:20.560
come on just switching around to the

05:20.560 --> 05:32.730
other side right now so it rocks it the

05:32.730 --> 05:36.550
other way

05:36.550 --> 05:38.460
yeah

05:38.460 --> 05:48.260
by the balls now yeah whenever you're

05:48.260 --> 05:49.984
pulling a string of pipe you pull it up

05:49.984 --> 05:50.990
like this and it's hanging in the

05:50.990 --> 05:52.620
derrick and then there's a thing down

05:52.620 --> 05:56.139
here called the slips it

05:56.139 --> 06:00.540
yeah we had that clamp to hold all the

06:00.540 --> 06:02.340
pieces if you will still left in the

06:02.340 --> 06:04.930
hole and then we could cut this off and

06:04.930 --> 06:08.759
lay this piece down okay we're ready to

06:08.759 --> 06:10.870
cut that was just a matter of David

06:10.870 --> 06:13.180
torching them off we've got the clamp in

06:13.180 --> 06:20.150
place so it's pulled 20 torch pull 20

06:20.150 --> 06:22.479
torch

06:22.479 --> 06:34.139
lamed all right over there

06:34.139 --> 06:35.669
we got the first piece Oh everything

06:35.669 --> 06:41.350
worked fine procedure seems to work then

06:41.350 --> 06:42.919
we come back and get on to the next one

06:42.919 --> 06:44.520
and just keep following that process

06:44.520 --> 06:51.539
till we get that pipe out of the hole

06:51.539 --> 06:54.770
as rick marty and dave blankenship work

06:54.770 --> 06:57.080
to clear away rusted pipes and debris

06:57.080 --> 07:00.840
from 10x Craig tester and his stepson

07:00.840 --> 07:03.590
Jack Begley along with veteran Oak

07:03.590 --> 07:06.520
Island treasure hunter dan henskee

07:06.520 --> 07:08.400
arrived near the islands fabled money

07:08.400 --> 07:12.120
pit to test an incredible theory one

07:12.120 --> 07:14.229
that suggests there isn't only one

07:14.229 --> 07:16.680
treasure buried on Oak Island but

07:16.680 --> 07:19.289
several when the Laird's came here they

07:19.289 --> 07:22.860
this map using satellite technology it

07:22.860 --> 07:25.419
seems a little far out you're saying

07:25.419 --> 07:28.449
that you can find objects within tunnels

07:28.449 --> 07:30.910
we can through the magnetic resonance

07:30.910 --> 07:34.240
imaging a few weeks ago father-and-son

07:34.240 --> 07:37.110
treasure hunters Robert and Bob Leonard

07:37.110 --> 07:39.479
came to Oak Island to present evidence

07:39.479 --> 07:41.610
that using highly advanced satellite

07:41.610 --> 07:44.289
based technology they had identified a

07:44.289 --> 07:46.580
vast network of underground treasure

07:46.580 --> 07:50.919
tunnels we've got tunnels we've got gold

07:50.919 --> 07:58.780
bronze silver rubies ivory diamonds and

07:58.780 --> 08:00.390
one part of me says this is completely

08:00.390 --> 08:03.319
impossible on the other hand right

08:03.319 --> 08:05.080
absolutely

08:05.080 --> 08:06.990
if we're able to dig up one of these

08:06.990 --> 08:09.240
hits today it should put me at a hundred

08:09.240 --> 08:11.970
percent that this technology works so

08:11.970 --> 08:14.479
what I did I examine the map before

08:14.479 --> 08:15.669
leaving the island

08:15.669 --> 08:17.710
the Leonard's gape Jack and the team a

08:17.710 --> 08:20.710
number of GPS coordinates indicated were

08:20.710 --> 08:22.950
both precious and non-precious metal

08:22.950 --> 08:25.770
targets should lie buried I picked out a

08:25.770 --> 08:27.419
bunch of small targets

08:27.419 --> 08:29.710
that are about two to three feet down on

08:29.710 --> 08:32.520
this map and there's one that's over

08:32.520 --> 08:35.860
here by the money pit and I got a GPS

08:35.860 --> 08:38.029
unit that should get us within a cup of

08:38.029 --> 08:39.620
feet well why don't you lead us there

08:39.620 --> 08:40.620
Dan

08:40.620 --> 08:43.620
Wow this is the red line north okay all

08:43.620 --> 08:45.450
right well you want to lead us there

08:45.450 --> 08:47.589
okay here we go

08:47.589 --> 08:52.540
getting too old for this we better find

08:52.540 --> 08:54.580
something soon we really weren't looking

08:54.580 --> 08:56.170
for a treasure at this point in time we

08:56.170 --> 08:58.560
were looking for accuracy of this map

08:58.560 --> 09:02.210
that the Leonard's presented to us okay

09:02.210 --> 09:04.820
now it started near the money pit there

09:04.820 --> 09:06.930
was supposedly a piece of metals that

09:06.930 --> 09:08.660
was buried anywhere from two to three

09:08.660 --> 09:10.930
feet down what do you think that's

09:10.930 --> 09:13.810
pretty close we located it based on GPS

09:13.810 --> 09:17.261
right about here and then ran a metal

09:17.261 --> 09:19.770
detector determined where it might be

09:19.770 --> 09:26.740
looks good within seconds Craig tester

09:26.740 --> 09:30.370
gets a reading so it's right on the edge

09:30.370 --> 09:32.580
could they really have found a metal

09:32.580 --> 09:35.730
object buried in shallow ground right

09:35.730 --> 09:38.060
were Robert and Bob Leonard indicated it

09:38.060 --> 09:39.060
would be

09:39.060 --> 09:51.840
bigger back at 10x Rick Marty and the

09:51.840 --> 09:54.600
team continue their efforts to clear one

09:54.600 --> 09:56.709
of the corroded metal riser pipes from

09:56.709 --> 09:57.709
the shaft

09:57.709 --> 10:25.900
we're ready to cut

10:25.900 --> 10:49.730
well looks like we lost their pipe boys

10:49.730 --> 10:55.410
how the hell did that happen the team's

10:55.410 --> 10:58.060
plan to pull a riser pipe from 10x has

10:58.060 --> 11:01.840
just gone terribly wrong after cutting a

11:01.840 --> 11:04.590
second 20-foot section of the 180 foot

11:04.590 --> 11:08.520
pipe the weight of the remaining 140

11:08.520 --> 11:10.820
feet has slipped through its brace and

11:10.820 --> 11:13.830
fallen back down the shaft landing far

11:13.830 --> 11:17.050
below the water level what started as an

11:17.050 --> 11:19.649
operation to remove obstructions has

11:19.649 --> 11:22.640
just become much more complicated my

11:22.640 --> 11:24.740
concern is that you know it did fall

11:24.740 --> 11:27.540
straight down I'm worried that it might

11:27.540 --> 11:30.810
have gotten tangled with the ladder if

11:30.810 --> 11:34.720
it did then that's much more difficult

11:34.720 --> 11:38.130
for the divers is it hung up is it just

11:38.130 --> 11:39.670
balanced somewhere might it fall when

11:39.670 --> 11:42.170
they're in 10x we simply don't know

11:42.170 --> 11:48.040
so we need a diver to go down hook the

11:48.040 --> 11:51.590
chain onto it or a cable and pull it up

11:51.590 --> 11:55.329
and throw it all over again it's

11:55.329 --> 11:56.770
something that weighs several thousand

11:56.770 --> 12:00.500
pounds dropped 40 feet it was cooking

12:00.500 --> 12:03.200
when it hit bottom and that pipe is

12:03.200 --> 12:05.560
docking we needed to come up with a

12:05.560 --> 12:07.450
different plan the island was another

12:07.450 --> 12:16.770
one when did we win

12:16.770 --> 12:19.450
there's a bunch of rocks meanwhile back

12:19.450 --> 12:22.070
near the money pit Craig tester Jack

12:22.070 --> 12:24.529
Begley and dan henskee have just

12:24.529 --> 12:27.560
detected a metal target run for the

12:27.560 --> 12:29.360
Leonard's nuclear magnetic resonance

12:29.360 --> 12:31.670
imaging map indicated they would find

12:31.670 --> 12:37.970
one still not all they have to do now is

12:37.970 --> 12:41.930
dig it up it really makes me understand

12:41.930 --> 12:45.800
how tough it is to dig this stuff that's

12:45.800 --> 12:47.600
why you could dig the money pit without

12:47.600 --> 12:50.420
putting in cribbing or safety liner the

12:50.420 --> 12:53.370
ground is sturdy tough yeah although the

12:53.370 --> 12:55.660
object they're looking for is not likely

12:55.660 --> 12:56.899
to be treasure

12:56.899 --> 12:58.810
it could help prove the theory that

12:58.810 --> 13:01.370
there are dozens of treasure tunnels and

13:01.370 --> 13:04.730
treasure sites line deep underground and

13:04.730 --> 13:07.670
all over the island we kept on digging

13:07.670 --> 13:09.740
deeper and the signal got stronger but

13:09.740 --> 13:13.070
in a bigger area I'm really starting to

13:13.070 --> 13:16.839
eat this clay it was such a big clean

13:16.839 --> 13:20.310
target but oh my gosh I think I thought

13:20.310 --> 13:23.250
this was gonna take tea all day well

13:23.250 --> 13:25.700
used to talk about digging down to China

13:25.700 --> 13:28.290
but I don't think Jack here is in much

13:28.290 --> 13:31.970
danger of reaching China

13:31.970 --> 13:33.529
if there is something two to three feet

13:33.529 --> 13:36.170
down I'm gonna make sure that I get to

13:36.170 --> 13:40.020
it and find it there you go all right

13:40.020 --> 13:41.980
that looks like a rough stretch yeah

13:41.980 --> 13:42.980
there it is

13:42.980 --> 13:48.200
now what is it that's what we're gonna

13:48.200 --> 13:50.580
find out hopefully

13:50.580 --> 13:58.470
it is it's a big piece of metal is that

13:58.470 --> 14:01.209
all metal coming this way yeah

14:01.209 --> 14:03.829
yeah it is basically there's a wide

14:03.829 --> 14:06.550
range of things that might be and none

14:06.550 --> 14:08.670
of them valuable it's just the way

14:08.670 --> 14:13.200
things my hopes up as one of the three

14:13.200 --> 14:17.420
men who dug 10x more than 40 years ago

14:17.420 --> 14:19.500
dan henskee knows Oak Island like the

14:19.500 --> 14:21.550
back of his hand

14:21.550 --> 14:24.250
he's also experienced his fair share of

14:24.250 --> 14:26.959
helpful excitement followed by bitter

14:26.959 --> 14:31.600
disappointment nevertheless the 76 year

14:31.600 --> 14:38.200
old treasure hunter refuses to give up

14:38.200 --> 14:42.019
yeah more than anyone on the island he

14:42.019 --> 14:44.149
believes that the legends about deadly

14:44.149 --> 14:48.040
curses and buried treasures are true

14:48.040 --> 14:52.130
don't want to get in front of their

14:52.130 --> 14:57.220
table down there wouldn't you know I was

14:57.220 --> 14:59.040
under the cabling this wasn't common

14:59.040 --> 15:01.670
there you go it's all yours you work for

15:01.670 --> 15:04.570
it hey you guys they took an old man to

15:04.570 --> 15:07.370
do a young man's job what the heck is

15:07.370 --> 15:09.860
this looks like a tubing looks like a

15:09.860 --> 15:12.519
piece of pipe that's split from one end

15:12.519 --> 15:16.269
to the other which is interesting

15:16.269 --> 15:18.340
according to the maps applied to the Oak

15:18.340 --> 15:20.800
Island team by Robert and Bob Leonard

15:20.800 --> 15:24.149
this exact spot is where their satellite

15:24.149 --> 15:26.829
based technology indicated the presence

15:26.829 --> 15:31.529
of a ferrous metal like iron

15:31.529 --> 15:33.611
we found the pipe exactly where they

15:33.611 --> 15:35.991
showed it was supposed to be I think it

15:35.991 --> 15:38.580
gives really good validity to their

15:38.580 --> 15:41.410
whole technology but if the Leonard's

15:41.410 --> 15:44.220
map spotted the iron could the readings

15:44.220 --> 15:48.740
on gold silver and jewels which are

15:48.740 --> 15:51.510
allegedly buried much deeper be accurate

15:51.510 --> 15:54.220
as well that looks like it's been there

15:54.220 --> 15:56.839
quite a while and a little salt water

15:56.839 --> 15:59.860
too booth I say they cool though I feel

15:59.860 --> 16:01.920
like it's kind of my responsibility to

16:01.920 --> 16:04.269
help prove that this technology is

16:04.269 --> 16:06.480
something worth noticing instead of just

16:06.480 --> 16:08.600
kind of throwing it away yeah all right

16:08.600 --> 16:10.910
okay so what gets credit for locating

16:10.910 --> 16:14.790
this you do you brought it up who gets

16:14.790 --> 16:22.290
to carry all the gear back thank you Oh

16:22.290 --> 16:24.690
later that same day members of the Oak

16:24.690 --> 16:27.930
Island team gather in the war room okay

16:27.930 --> 16:30.930
guys back on point where else do we want

16:30.930 --> 16:33.170
to drill once you bring up your thing no

16:33.170 --> 16:35.610
Jack I want to put the Leonard's to rest

16:35.610 --> 16:38.500
I dug up that piece was that the depth

16:38.500 --> 16:39.620
they said it would be

16:39.620 --> 16:42.200
although Marty Rick and Dave have

16:42.200 --> 16:43.980
experienced setbacks during their

16:43.980 --> 16:46.240
attempts to clear the riser pipes out of

16:46.240 --> 16:49.649
10x Jack and Craig's news that the

16:49.649 --> 16:51.769
Leonard's map may actually lead them to

16:51.769 --> 16:54.510
treasure has rekindled their eagerness

16:54.510 --> 16:56.620
to keep digging I really like for this

16:56.620 --> 16:59.139
spot to get why do you believe it jack

16:59.139 --> 17:04.369
it seems to me to be somewhat feasible

17:04.369 --> 17:07.648
this is supposin technology and I think

17:07.648 --> 17:09.618
that drilling it is the best way to find

17:09.618 --> 17:11.929
out you know they're giving us a map

17:11.929 --> 17:14.108
that shows where jewels and rubies and

17:14.108 --> 17:16.519
stuff are it seems way too good to be

17:16.519 --> 17:17.519
true

17:17.519 --> 17:23.749
quite honestly well Jack usually that is

17:23.749 --> 17:27.539
because to drill well yeah yeah but I am

17:27.539 --> 17:29.979
looking to prove or disprove theories

17:29.979 --> 17:32.139
that come to us I am but I might say

17:32.139 --> 17:34.600
some Jack I don't I just absolutely do

17:34.600 --> 17:38.139
not buy at all the photographic NMR and

17:38.139 --> 17:45.970
MRI I don't buy it but this to me I mean

17:45.970 --> 17:47.889
just be candid there's this want to

17:47.889 --> 17:51.000
believe thing that yes you join cavity

17:51.000 --> 17:56.850
go get it it's the latins cave touch

17:56.850 --> 17:59.340
nothing just bring me the lamp

17:59.340 --> 18:03.729
right but the reason I'm it made me make

18:03.729 --> 18:05.320
sense to still drill that well is the

18:05.320 --> 18:07.519
resistivity at least but resistivity is

18:07.519 --> 18:11.570
a known technology whether their device

18:11.570 --> 18:13.080
worked I don't know right here's what

18:13.080 --> 18:14.471
I'm willing to do if you will if you're

18:14.471 --> 18:18.809
willing to vote with me okay yeah where

18:18.809 --> 18:19.809
are you

18:19.809 --> 18:25.260
I'm 5050 I we don't make them right to

18:25.260 --> 18:26.970
be this or the right then I'll go up

18:26.970 --> 18:31.119
let's do it right no I don't yeah

18:31.119 --> 18:32.119
two thumbs

18:32.119 --> 18:46.609
I vote like this with me okay way I want

18:46.609 --> 18:50.360
what out of respect for the fellowship

18:50.360 --> 18:53.039
then it would carry well well thank you

18:53.039 --> 18:54.639
hey we're going on Thank You own all

18:54.639 --> 18:56.929
right jack we're all going in on this at

18:56.929 --> 18:58.659
least partially from your enthusiasm

18:58.659 --> 18:59.659
okay

18:59.659 --> 19:02.529
way to go Jack it's not drilled yeah

19:02.529 --> 19:06.330
well you got your hole I know

19:06.330 --> 19:12.489
it is the start of a new day on Oak

19:12.489 --> 19:17.050
Island a day of new opportunities new

19:17.050 --> 19:21.350
information and new challenges hey Rick

19:21.350 --> 19:25.460
I do have a bit of a wall kind of feels

19:25.460 --> 19:28.909
like bad news I was on the phone all day

19:28.909 --> 19:31.100
with my office and I need to go back

19:31.100 --> 19:32.580
Saturday and be gone next week

19:32.580 --> 19:38.369
and I'm kind of disappointing I mean I

19:38.369 --> 19:41.919
know I know because the whole thing

19:41.919 --> 19:43.690
about this was for you and I'd have fun

19:43.690 --> 19:44.690
together

19:44.690 --> 19:45.960
all right next week is fun but next week

19:45.960 --> 19:48.750
is the busy week yeah I know that's what

19:48.750 --> 19:50.470
I feel bad about

19:50.470 --> 19:52.970
I you know I woke up not this morning

19:52.970 --> 19:55.139
but yesterday and I said our luck has

19:55.139 --> 19:58.030
changed we're gonna make progress we're

19:58.030 --> 19:59.960
gonna get to the bottom of 10x and it's

19:59.960 --> 20:02.899
gonna happen expeditiously that's how I

20:02.899 --> 20:05.739
feel I do I feel real bad about leaving

20:05.739 --> 20:09.989
look you know like you know here's my

20:09.989 --> 20:12.940
thing about that you know if we don't

20:12.940 --> 20:16.010
make significant progress next week I

20:16.010 --> 20:19.019
want to promise from you that we will

20:19.019 --> 20:21.889
legitimately revisit the drawdown

20:21.889 --> 20:24.349
intention

20:24.349 --> 20:29.039
look it's a personal agenda call it

20:29.039 --> 20:30.919
flawed but I would like to stand in the

20:30.919 --> 20:34.120
bottom last spring the Oak Island team

20:34.120 --> 20:36.140
held a meeting at Marty and Craig's

20:36.140 --> 20:39.950
offices in Traverse City Michigan there

20:39.950 --> 20:42.090
Rick lagina made it known that rather

20:42.090 --> 20:45.471
than send divers in wetsuits down 10x he

20:45.471 --> 20:47.700
favored an approach that would pump the

20:47.700 --> 20:50.610
shaft dry a strategy that would offer

20:50.610 --> 20:54.190
broader access and visibility I think it

20:54.190 --> 20:57.029
can be done cheaply it's my belief that

20:57.029 --> 21:00.190
it can be done safely and we'll learn

21:00.190 --> 21:02.299
certain thing is gonna be real clear I

21:02.299 --> 21:03.299
don't want to do that

21:03.299 --> 21:05.100
I think it's undefinable dangerous

21:05.100 --> 21:08.700
problem is when you evacuate a Danny

21:08.700 --> 21:11.619
sort of tube if you have water pressure

21:11.619 --> 21:13.909
on the outside and there's nothing

21:13.909 --> 21:15.649
inside just air pressure on the inside

21:15.649 --> 21:17.769
then that force becomes enormous tries

21:17.769 --> 21:21.440
to collapse Rick I hate the idea you

21:21.440 --> 21:23.179
going down the hall hey TD of anybody

21:23.179 --> 21:25.009
going down that hole I'm willing to take

21:25.009 --> 21:27.999
the risk and I believe that the shaft

21:27.999 --> 21:32.259
will stand

21:32.259 --> 21:33.729
I'm not asking you for a promise that we

21:33.729 --> 21:35.679
will do that I'm asking you for a

21:35.679 --> 21:37.620
promise that we will legitimately

21:37.620 --> 21:43.309
revisit that issue

21:43.309 --> 21:45.970
you got my promise fine I will in good

21:45.970 --> 21:47.779
faith sit down and we'll discuss it

21:47.779 --> 21:50.919
right you've got it brother

21:50.919 --> 21:55.639
promises mutual promises done oh yeah at

21:55.639 --> 21:57.609
the bottom of 10-x

21:57.609 --> 22:06.919
and it will reveal its secrets

22:06.919 --> 22:09.409
while Marty Rick and the rest of the

22:09.409 --> 22:11.440
team returned to the task of clearing

22:11.440 --> 22:14.309
the riser pipes out of the shaft Craig

22:14.309 --> 22:16.850
tester along with his son Drake and

22:16.850 --> 22:19.840
stepson Jack Begley have traveled to the

22:19.840 --> 22:22.259
middle of the island northwest of the

22:22.259 --> 22:23.259
Oak Island swamp

22:23.259 --> 22:29.889
meeting with them he's Jordan Rogers and

22:29.889 --> 22:32.679
his assistant Cody penny Oh from Valley

22:32.679 --> 22:34.779
well drillers well let's show them where

22:34.779 --> 22:38.112
the spot is you got it right yeah

22:38.112 --> 22:40.590
it was at this same spot that Robert and

22:40.590 --> 22:43.279
Bob Leonard indicated there could be a

22:43.279 --> 22:46.440
large treasure cavity containing gold

22:46.440 --> 22:49.519
lying approximately 140 feet below the

22:49.519 --> 22:55.349
surface

22:55.349 --> 22:57.750
pretty much right here this is pretty

22:57.750 --> 22:59.879
much the middle of the cavity and then

22:59.879 --> 23:02.769
it's even longer that way okay all right

23:02.769 --> 23:05.279
let's get going today's the day the

23:05.279 --> 23:07.619
cavity should be around 140 feet down

23:07.619 --> 23:09.789
that's what they're projecting the slate

23:09.789 --> 23:11.919
should drill quite fast I would think

23:11.919 --> 23:13.779
three hours and we should be down to

23:13.779 --> 23:18.249
that depth so you should know something

23:18.249 --> 23:21.989
by noon today the first 10 to 15 feet of

23:21.989 --> 23:23.639
earth that Jordan will be drilling

23:23.639 --> 23:26.899
through is hard glacial till composed of

23:26.899 --> 23:30.909
soil gravel and boulders steel casing

23:30.909 --> 23:33.620
will then be inserted to ensure that the

23:33.620 --> 23:37.099
hole doesn't collapse during the process

23:37.099 --> 23:38.639
once through what is called the

23:38.639 --> 23:41.719
overburden the ground changes to hard

23:41.719 --> 23:42.719
solid slate

23:42.719 --> 24:04.509
at a great pace we should be there in no

24:04.509 --> 24:08.830
time what we're looking for is for that

24:08.830 --> 24:11.100
bit to also drop down into the hole we

24:11.100 --> 24:13.659
wanted to drop into that cavity slates

24:13.659 --> 24:15.349
don't have cavity so if we find

24:15.349 --> 24:17.649
something here it should be man-made

24:17.649 --> 24:21.940
so this one

24:21.940 --> 24:28.080
next section should hit it should be

24:28.080 --> 24:32.159
real easy to see the drill drop because

24:32.159 --> 24:40.919
it will literally drop

24:40.919 --> 24:54.059
congratulations out we hit it water

24:54.059 --> 24:56.590
the presence of water is not a good sign

24:56.590 --> 24:59.860
it could mean that instead of a man-made

24:59.860 --> 25:02.380
treasure vault containing gold there is

25:02.380 --> 25:04.869
nothing more buried here than a natural

25:04.869 --> 25:07.330
underground spring can we keep going the

25:07.330 --> 25:09.610
extra 20 pizzas see if we can hit that

25:09.610 --> 25:12.640
supposin cavity though yeah

25:12.640 --> 25:17.299
Jackson Susie azzam has been sky-high

25:17.299 --> 25:18.960
but he was the one out here when they

25:18.960 --> 25:20.981
ran the resistivity he saw where they

25:20.981 --> 25:23.740
indicated the cave was and seeing is

25:23.740 --> 25:28.659
believing Jordan and his team drilled

25:28.659 --> 25:31.729
through the water an additional 10 then

25:31.729 --> 25:34.419
20 feet down in hopes of finding the

25:34.419 --> 25:38.219
cavity but still nothing only water

25:38.219 --> 25:44.349
you can

25:44.349 --> 25:51.580
start breaking down here appreciate it

25:51.580 --> 25:53.609
we did hit a water zone that may be

25:53.609 --> 25:56.669
proving that the resistivity part of the

25:56.669 --> 25:59.279
test they had run was working that maybe

25:59.279 --> 26:00.960
it's not a cavity they were saying it's

26:00.960 --> 26:02.840
just fractured slate and we're getting

26:02.840 --> 26:06.349
water from that for the fractured slate

26:06.349 --> 26:08.720
I'm not done I'm done searching with the

26:08.720 --> 26:10.509
NMR I there's a couple more hits that we

26:10.509 --> 26:12.539
can drill and I might be able to talk

26:12.539 --> 26:14.820
you guys into it if I find those other

26:14.820 --> 26:17.559
subsurface hits I think after this one

26:17.559 --> 26:19.409
it's gonna be much tougher the talking

26:19.409 --> 26:22.639
the group into the drill could finding

26:22.639 --> 26:25.419
only water really be an indication that

26:25.419 --> 26:28.999
the Leonard's treasure map is flawed or

26:28.999 --> 26:31.010
is it possible that the maps numerous

26:31.010 --> 26:33.429
treasure sites just like the original

26:33.429 --> 26:35.969
money pit have been booby-trapped by

26:35.969 --> 26:38.139
means of an ingenious network of

26:38.139 --> 26:40.749
underground flood tunnels it's

26:40.749 --> 26:42.999
chief by any means to drill wells we

26:42.999 --> 26:45.309
need to focus our money on finding the

26:45.309 --> 26:47.349
treasure and if this could have led to

26:47.349 --> 26:50.639
it great but but we spent the money here

26:50.639 --> 26:53.330
and we need to move on to other areas

26:53.330 --> 26:55.500
other technologies that'll take us to

26:55.500 --> 26:58.490
the treasure let's go let everybody know

26:58.490 --> 27:11.349
all right okay let's get this thing down

27:11.349 --> 27:13.559
hole with his brother headed back to

27:13.559 --> 27:16.840
Michigan on business Rick lagina returns

27:16.840 --> 27:19.340
to the task of clearing away the riser

27:19.340 --> 27:24.720
pipes from 10x

27:24.720 --> 27:29.049
first people need to partially drain the

27:29.049 --> 27:30.899
235-foot deep borehole in order to

27:30.899 --> 27:35.769
expose the pipes and allow easier access

27:35.769 --> 27:38.499
to do so he will insert a high-powered

27:38.499 --> 27:41.379
water pump into another borehole known

27:41.379 --> 27:45.429
as 201 X this is a hole that dan

27:45.429 --> 27:47.190
Blankenship drilled more than 30 years

27:47.190 --> 27:49.789
ago when he needed to flush water and

27:49.789 --> 27:54.080
debris out while widening the shaft it

27:54.080 --> 27:57.269
is connected to 10x through tunnels that

27:57.269 --> 28:00.119
are approximately 235 feet deep

28:00.119 --> 28:04.339
underground today mark verge is here

28:04.339 --> 28:08.679
he's gonna do the pump install

28:08.679 --> 28:11.320
in addition to the 140 foot section of

28:11.320 --> 28:14.299
riser pipe that fell down the shaft

28:14.299 --> 28:16.630
there are also two others that will need

28:16.630 --> 28:21.739
to be removed all right we get a 40

28:21.739 --> 28:23.820
horsepower pump that will allow a

28:23.820 --> 28:27.700
drawdown of 30 feet and keep it at 30

28:27.700 --> 28:30.149
feet so we'll get that going a 4 inch

28:30.149 --> 28:31.649
discharge line unto the beach

28:31.649 --> 28:42.499
you're ready to hook that up yeah in

28:42.499 --> 28:44.610
order to draw the water out of borehole

28:44.610 --> 28:47.890
2 or 1x Rick and the team have laid more

28:47.890 --> 28:50.399
than 200 feet of hose down to Smith's

28:50.399 --> 28:53.619
Cove they've also built a burner or

28:53.619 --> 28:56.860
embankment to ensure the pumping doesn't

28:56.860 --> 28:59.929
cause erosion to the beach good job boys

28:59.929 --> 29:03.789
okay

29:03.789 --> 29:08.630
we've got our fingers crossed on the

29:08.630 --> 29:12.049
boreholes can it perform as as we hope

29:12.049 --> 29:14.279
with the pump in place and running the

29:14.279 --> 29:17.580
water level in 10x slowly begins to drop

29:17.580 --> 29:20.759
the goal is to remove the three pipes

29:20.759 --> 29:22.929
simply because it allows the divers a

29:22.929 --> 29:26.379
less obstructed diving so we remove the

29:26.379 --> 29:29.269
three pipes and it's three less things

29:29.269 --> 29:33.599
they have to encounter on their way down

29:33.599 --> 29:34.899
get your horses in here let's go

29:34.899 --> 29:36.100
what's your problem what do you think

29:36.100 --> 29:39.889
you can latch on to that six inch I

29:39.889 --> 29:41.399
think so

29:41.399 --> 29:43.509
Dan the torch it up and unload them

29:43.509 --> 29:50.229
right here give me 40 foot of hose

29:50.229 --> 29:53.749
we pull up we tie off we can torch them

29:53.749 --> 29:56.320
off at surface lay the pipes down and

29:56.320 --> 29:58.299
just keep pulling up and extracting the

29:58.299 --> 30:05.179
obstacles you got the best job you want

30:05.179 --> 30:11.049
to take this seat now that the water

30:11.049 --> 30:13.580
level has been drained down the team has

30:13.580 --> 30:16.659
been able to locate the 140 foot section

30:16.659 --> 30:20.429
of Weiser pipe that fell down 10x but

30:20.429 --> 30:22.300
before they can remove it there is

30:22.300 --> 30:24.460
another pipe that will have to be taken

30:24.460 --> 30:25.460
out first

30:25.460 --> 30:29.049
I'll do it

30:29.049 --> 30:30.519
when Charles suggested that he would

30:30.519 --> 30:32.639
like to go down I was a little worried

30:32.639 --> 30:34.909
because before today the one thing that

30:34.909 --> 30:39.200
he had never done was put himself in 10x

30:39.200 --> 30:41.330
watch the lips that's where you're going

30:41.330 --> 30:43.229
to get hung up

30:43.229 --> 30:47.489
it can't be a real tough nut you gotta

30:47.489 --> 30:50.339
correct its confined space you have to

30:50.339 --> 30:51.899
make sure the basket is properly

30:51.899 --> 30:55.580
oriented I want to go down and also make

30:55.580 --> 30:57.629
sure that all the equipment to

30:57.629 --> 30:59.690
accomplish the task it's at hand

30:59.690 --> 31:03.570
but that guy lives and breathes this

31:03.570 --> 31:06.629
place and he knows sometimes you just

31:06.629 --> 31:08.309
want to get your feet dirty and get it

31:08.309 --> 31:13.499
done so far everything is going

31:13.499 --> 31:16.950
according to plan but on Oak Island the

31:16.950 --> 31:19.700
only thing that can be expected is that

31:19.700 --> 31:23.429
the unexpected will happen that fell as

31:23.429 --> 31:25.820
Rick Dave Charles and their partners

31:25.820 --> 31:28.639
know all too well the island lures those

31:28.639 --> 31:30.159
who would know its secrets with the

31:30.159 --> 31:32.989
promise of treasure you trust that Joker

31:32.989 --> 31:35.409
the Joker die juden island the one I'm

31:35.409 --> 31:37.700
worried about but when the seeker gets

31:37.700 --> 31:41.589
too close tragedy strikes and usually

31:41.589 --> 31:43.539
without warning

31:43.539 --> 31:49.929
such was the case on March 26 1897

31:49.929 --> 31:52.200
Maynard Kaiser one of the men hired by

31:52.200 --> 31:54.349
Frederick Blair to help excavate the

31:54.349 --> 31:56.999
money pit was being lifted out of the

31:56.999 --> 31:59.830
shaft when a hoisting rope mysteriously

31:59.830 --> 32:03.229
slipped off a poet sending him to his

32:03.229 --> 32:07.969
death some hundred feet below when he

32:07.969 --> 32:08.969
starts coming up

32:08.969 --> 32:10.700
everybody off

32:10.700 --> 32:13.759
bring back out

32:13.759 --> 32:20.889
and while baby you can do it

32:20.889 --> 32:55.019
the weight of the second riser pipe has

32:55.019 --> 32:57.979
snapped the cable dealing Rick lagina

32:57.979 --> 33:00.440
and the Oak Island team another serious

33:00.440 --> 33:03.100
setback have to go down and get that one

33:03.100 --> 33:05.870
again won't we mm-hmm hi Charles and

33:05.870 --> 33:07.389
think that want to try that one who'd go

33:07.389 --> 33:10.179
on that yeah harness yourself up and see

33:10.179 --> 33:15.259
if he can put this back in the bucket

33:15.259 --> 33:18.580
the pipe we lost the fact that it was

33:18.580 --> 33:20.469
still vertical was great what do you

33:20.469 --> 33:23.759
want Charles the bucket up a bit David

33:23.759 --> 33:26.359
that's good right there halt it Charles

33:26.359 --> 33:28.659
went down hole and latched on to it got

33:28.659 --> 33:30.080
in taos okay pull me up

33:30.080 --> 33:35.589
it was a bit of a struggle you want to

33:35.589 --> 33:38.809
get through the shackle there yeah we'll

33:38.809 --> 33:41.259
try one last pull on that riser pipe

33:41.259 --> 33:42.259
hopefully it'll come

33:42.259 --> 33:50.090
yep nice cut

33:50.090 --> 34:11.549
Oh God another three or four feet yeah

34:11.549 --> 34:23.418
but we got to put that i-beam across

34:23.418 --> 34:26.960
okay well drag it over here

34:26.960 --> 34:32.829
I push over far as you can't beat

34:32.829 --> 34:35.018
finally progress is being made

34:35.018 --> 34:41.668
now there are only two more riser pipes

34:41.668 --> 34:44.000
left to be removed Erica

34:44.000 --> 34:46.918
once done professional divers will be

34:46.918 --> 34:49.179
called in to clear out the debris that

34:49.179 --> 34:52.938
lies deeper down under the murky water

35:01.539 --> 35:04.519
for dan blankenship the man who dug 10x

35:04.519 --> 35:07.530
more than 40 years ago the sight of all

35:07.530 --> 35:09.381
the discarded riser pipes is a

35:09.381 --> 35:13.619
bittersweet one because for him each one

35:13.619 --> 35:16.859
represents decades of back-breaking work

35:16.859 --> 35:19.869
personal struggle hopeful planning and

35:19.869 --> 35:29.019
chronic disappointment
but now if all

35:29.019 --> 35:32.079
goes well Dan may soon have the answers

35:32.079 --> 35:35.359
and the validation he has been seeking

35:35.359 --> 35:41.299
for half a century

35:41.299 --> 35:43.490
there is only time to remove one more

35:43.490 --> 35:47.000
pipe before nightfall the pipe that

35:47.000 --> 35:49.480
slipped the team's grasp two days ago

35:49.480 --> 35:59.319
and Dave Blankenship is up for the task

35:59.319 --> 36:02.720
I can tip them over no you can't just

36:02.720 --> 36:15.130
get us some pipe up the surface there

36:15.130 --> 36:31.640
that's all you have to do

36:31.640 --> 36:42.260
he's caught take me up a little bit

36:42.260 --> 36:43.260
all that

36:43.260 --> 36:44.260
right now and easy

36:44.260 --> 36:45.260
I'll be right there

36:45.260 --> 36:52.140
hold everything right there

36:52.140 --> 37:03.470
oh nothing on that page

37:03.470 --> 37:04.990
okay good get me out of here

37:04.990 --> 37:19.270
there she comes well the truth of the

37:19.270 --> 37:20.760
matter is what hadn't been a very

37:20.760 --> 37:22.720
successful day and we thought okay we're

37:22.720 --> 37:25.790
gonna get even coming up easy alright

37:25.790 --> 37:28.210
we're gonna take one punch at this thing

37:28.210 --> 37:31.150
and that was the punch get that riser on

37:31.150 --> 37:32.839
it a whole

37:32.839 --> 37:34.019
watch your finger prick

37:34.019 --> 37:44.630
that's free coming at you

37:44.630 --> 37:46.049
what's important is that we're actually

37:46.049 --> 37:48.079
working together as a team

37:48.079 --> 37:50.770
oh I see Jack that's part of the fun of

37:50.770 --> 37:51.770
Oak Island

37:51.770 --> 37:57.660
so between us David Peter myself dan

37:57.660 --> 38:01.280
henskee Charles and Jack we were able to

38:01.280 --> 38:03.310
get those pipes out of the hole and we

38:03.310 --> 38:08.539
felt pretty good about it beautiful

38:08.539 --> 38:19.640
is that something hydrated at the bottom

38:19.640 --> 38:21.289
then there's a hunk about ten inches

38:21.289 --> 38:24.660
long of anhydride right here yeah that's

38:24.660 --> 38:29.950
a mystery when dan Blankenship dug 10x

38:29.950 --> 38:34.160
in the 1970s he hit anhydride at the 181

38:34.160 --> 38:37.599
foot level he continued to drill through

38:37.599 --> 38:40.270
the rock hard substance for another 44

38:40.270 --> 38:42.940
feet until he reached what he believed

38:42.940 --> 38:45.810
to be a 10 foot tall man-made treasure

38:45.810 --> 38:51.970
vault when she dropped when we lost it

38:51.970 --> 38:53.650
maybe she drilled itself a nice little

38:53.650 --> 38:57.040
plug that dropped too hard for that too

38:57.040 --> 38:59.990
hard for that have absolutely no

38:59.990 --> 39:04.010
explanation is it possible that the

39:04.010 --> 39:08.289
riser pipe managed to fall past the 181

39:08.289 --> 39:11.109
foot level and through the 27-inch wide

39:11.109 --> 39:14.829
hole if so could we be looking at a

39:14.829 --> 39:16.819
piece from the floor of an ancient

39:16.819 --> 39:17.819
treasure vault

39:17.819 --> 39:30.700
are you doing out there good so far you

39:30.700 --> 39:31.819
know you didn't drop any pipe did you

39:31.819 --> 39:35.190
get that out of the whole house that

39:35.190 --> 39:37.329
kind of typical Oak Island we were able

39:37.329 --> 39:40.250
to pull the 10 inch but we broke the

39:40.250 --> 39:44.450
wire cable pulling on it really yeah but

39:44.450 --> 39:46.750
we got it all out and then the pipe that

39:46.750 --> 39:51.349
you dropped the 8 inch we actually got a

39:51.349 --> 39:53.269
core out of the end hydrate with it

39:53.269 --> 39:56.869
because it went rocketing down yeah that

39:56.869 --> 40:01.849
wasn't went in the cavity is weird then

40:01.849 --> 40:07.010
you took a core of the floor not a core

40:07.010 --> 40:08.910
of the cap well it's easy it's easy

40:08.910 --> 40:10.980
enough we'll go measure it again I can't

40:10.980 --> 40:12.769
yeah it's gonna be interesting to see

40:12.769 --> 40:14.849
that right it might tell us a little bit

40:14.849 --> 40:16.440
about rock property we got our am i

40:16.440 --> 40:18.731
coming to clear the bottom of the hole

40:18.731 --> 40:20.820
on it right now we have two pipes out of

40:20.820 --> 40:23.400
the hole I think they have plenty enough

40:23.400 --> 40:25.780
room to do their work so when are you

40:25.780 --> 40:28.920
coming back your days

40:28.920 --> 40:31.869
yeah well make it sooner rather than

40:31.869 --> 40:34.400
later because you know what I want to do

40:34.400 --> 40:38.430
I want to get down there all righty

40:38.430 --> 40:41.529
see ya all right it is the end of

40:41.529 --> 40:43.869
another long day on Oak Island

40:43.869 --> 40:48.019
a day of setbacks but also possible

40:48.019 --> 40:50.490
breakthroughs

40:50.490 --> 40:52.819
two of ten exes old riser pipes have

40:52.819 --> 40:55.590
been removed and it won't be long before

40:55.590 --> 40:57.890
another attempt is made to reach the

40:57.890 --> 41:01.950
mysterious cavern that lies 235 feet

41:01.950 --> 41:06.210
beneath the surface of the island but

41:06.210 --> 41:09.609
once there what will be found ancient

41:09.609 --> 41:15.829
tools treasure chests a dead body or

41:15.829 --> 41:18.829
will it lead to even more questions

41:18.829 --> 41:22.500
questions that will only be answered if

41:22.500 --> 41:26.089
and when the island is ready to reveal

41:26.089 --> 41:31.060
them next time on the curse of Oak

41:31.060 --> 41:32.650
Island I'll move some dirt

41:32.650 --> 41:35.809
that's a nice machine right baby it's

41:35.809 --> 41:38.920
time to dig and you told me that you

41:38.920 --> 41:41.710
know where 30 rods to their lands right

41:41.710 --> 41:44.630
on that line x marks your spot right

41:44.630 --> 41:48.029
there I claim this spot

41:48.129 --> 41:51.129
we're digging on Oak Island

41:51.129 --> 41:54.229
x marks the spot

41:54.229 --> 41:57.389
you can see something wait what's that
