02:03.540 --> 02:06.794
I thought I'd been stood up.
It wouldn't be the first time.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.592
Traffic jam. Someone drove
their car off the M1.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.762
On purpose? Fucking selfish pricks
holding up the commute.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.019
What's wrong with a bottle of aspirin, eh?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.230
Mr Coulson?

02:21.892 --> 02:24.796
Repainted last week.
No one wants to touch the place.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.997
Agency can't shift it.

02:27.121 --> 02:29.115
Oh, I'll check the fuse box.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.992
Righty-tighty.
I'll give you the greatest hit, shall I?

02:38.116 --> 02:41.245
The neighbor said she heard a shot,
then the dog starts barking

02:41.370 --> 02:42.747
and then six more shots.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.796
Most likely, he's woken up
when he's heard the window smash,

02:46.917 --> 02:50.592
he's come down the stairs,
he's gone to have a look out here,

02:50.712 --> 02:54.216
and then he's gone to have another look
out the back here.

02:54.341 --> 02:58.892
That's when he's discovered the shooter,
who ends up there, where you are.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.061
Her arrival makes him panic
and that's when the gun goes off.

03:04.267 --> 03:08.192
But here's the head-scratcher
and it's a fucking doozy.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.191
When he gets shot...

03:12.693 --> 03:15.321
...he don't fall down.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.413
He just keeps walking.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.460
He doesn't drop where he should.
He just keeps coming.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.711
Even though he's been shot.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.210
The second shot...

03:33.338 --> 03:36.763
...hits her in the chest,
but she doesn't drop, either.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.896
She comes down a step or two.
Third shot hits her in the stomach.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.935
She keeps coming.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.560
Fourth shot hits her in the chest,
she still keeps coming.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.780
Shots five and six hit him
in the abdomen and the shoulder.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.743
And then the last shot
goes through his head...

03:56.570 --> 04:00.370
...up into the ceiling, by which time
he's practically on top of him.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.243
And then he drops the gun

04:03.368 --> 04:06.542
and he legs it out of the door
with the car keys.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.923
- Conversion?
- Er, yeah. A starter pistol.

04:12.711 --> 04:16.180
And they said the Olympics
wouldn't leave a legacy, eh?

04:16.298 --> 04:18.551
- They run at him?
- No, no.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.019
It was more of a leisurely stroll.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.561
SOCO said they came at him at an even pace,

04:24.681 --> 04:27.275
even had him in shot.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.521
They only finally lay down and died
when he left the house.

04:32.314 --> 04:35.989
Now, how's it possible
for two people to keep walking

04:36.109 --> 04:40.660
when they've been shot three times,
one of them in the face?

04:43.742 --> 04:46.461
I told you it was a head-scratcher.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.994
'We need to go after the property manager.'

05:27.118 --> 05:30.668
- 'Fuck's sake. What?'
- 'Who showed us in. What's his name?'

05:30.789 --> 05:35.761
'Fuck, er... Coulson. I think.
Jesus Christ, it's... '

05:35.877 --> 05:39.632
- 'Did you get an address?'
- 'Fuck's sake!'

05:56.356 --> 05:59.485
'The landlord says
he hasn't seen him for a week.

05:59.609 --> 06:03.864
'Estate agency doesn't know where he is.
It's hard enough finding this address.

06:03.989 --> 06:08.244
'No family. Mother dead.
Father estranged. Lives abroad.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.417
'Employment records practically non-existent.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.384
'Trust-fund kid,
which explains this place. Almost.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.093
'Coulson wasn't managing the building
at the times of the murders.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.841
'He only got the job three days
after the shooting.'

06:23.425 --> 06:25.848
Turns out Michael Coulson's
quite the colorful character.

06:25.969 --> 06:29.223
Been quizzed several times,
especially with violent stuff.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.817
But nothing's ever stuck.
Seems he genuinely never gets involved.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.896
Just hangs around criminals and crime scenes.

06:36.021 --> 06:40.276
I think he talks other people into doing
stuff just cos he gets a kick out of it.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.075
Then from July last year,
he's been seeing a psychiatrist.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.788
Dr Helen Fisher.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.997
Private sessions about two miles from here.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.255
Think he knows we're onto him?

06:53.371 --> 06:57.342
Well, I don't think he's popped out
for 20 fags and a wank mag.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.514
Yeah, I'll admit this doesn't look brilliant.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.573
- Hey, Kath.
- Jesus Christ!

07:21.691 --> 07:22.863
Chris...

07:24.861 --> 07:27.580
- Anyone else know you're here?
- Just Jim.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.449
Where have you been?

07:29.574 --> 07:31.042
Up north.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.538
Man of fucking mystery, aren't you?

07:36.623 --> 07:39.342
What makes you think he's the one?

07:40.377 --> 07:44.302
Been linked to similar things before.
Obsessed with crime scenes.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.516
Means he's a ghoul.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.596
Doesn't mean he's got
anything to do with this.

07:52.514 --> 07:56.815
He was seeing a psychotherapist
called Helen Fisher.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.405
Might be something in Fisher's notes
that'll tell us where he is.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.869
Go back up north, Chris.

08:22.377 --> 08:27.099
'Okay, there's a type
of depression, dysthymia.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.719
'It's long-term, mild symptoms,
but it persists over years.'

08:30.844 --> 08:34.565
So you can pretty much mumble
one-word answers for the first session.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.643
'Any day, really.'

08:39.227 --> 08:40.479
Erm, I...

08:41.395 --> 08:44.275
Yeah, no. Er, let me just check.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.877
Erm, yeah, that's fine.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.501
'Er, I don't know. Mid-morning?'

09:01.499 --> 09:03.547
'Yeah, what's the address, please?'

09:22.312 --> 09:24.155
How are you today?

09:25.523 --> 09:26.991
Fine.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.033
What do you do for a living, Chris?

09:31.154 --> 09:35.455
Could be living off benefits. Maybe
your parents are paying for your therapy.

09:36.975 --> 09:38.921
Don't have a job.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.711
How was this week for you?

09:45.293 --> 09:47.591
Have you done anything fun?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.764
Just shit.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.725
Are you on any medication?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.815
They were giving out Venlafaxine
like Smarties a while back,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.526
but that might've changed. I can check.

10:01.643 --> 10:05.364
Ven... laflax... flaxine. Ven...

10:05.480 --> 10:07.608
- Venlafaxine?
- Yeah.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.326
- I came off it, though.
- Okay.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.834
- You take notes?
- Yes.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.170
Sometimes I'll review them before a session.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.715
Where are they kept?

10:23.832 --> 10:26.210
- 'Probably not under lock and key.'
- I'm sorry?

10:26.334 --> 10:28.678
But they might be in a different room.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.720
- Your notes?
- Oh. Over there.

10:32.841 --> 10:37.472
But they're very safe.
Nothing about you leaves this practice.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.566
Can you tell me what you'd like
to get out of these sessions?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.942
I just wanna get better.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.192
'There's often no one else there.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.536
'Course if someone were to ring the office,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.202
'it might get her out of the room
for long enough.'

10:59.033 --> 11:01.661
You should've stayed up north, Chris.

11:08.084 --> 11:12.560
People who suffer from depression
often feel they've always felt this way.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.811
Like they're trapped in a cycle.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.274
So, what I'd like to do is...

11:26.227 --> 11:28.650
Excuse me. I'm gonna get that
if no one else will.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.002
Sorry. They hung up.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.039
Why do people do that?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.462
"Mr Coulson presents a vivid convincing case

12:30.583 --> 12:33.757
"that he is a... manic depressive,

12:33.878 --> 12:37.348
"but symptoms may be co-morbid with other..."

12:38.841 --> 12:41.720
Can't read that. "Disorders"?

12:41.844 --> 12:44.973
"As such, I'm not convinced
that he is fully bipolar.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.728
"I'm treating him as such
while keeping open to real pathology."

12:48.851 --> 12:51.149
Why would someone pretend to have an illness?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.818
Pots and kettles.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.034
"He has expressed interest in other patients.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.949
"Questions about range of conditions
patients are said to have.

12:59.070 --> 13:03.792
"I feel interest borders on morbidity,
especially in light of his history."

13:05.868 --> 13:07.711
Then there's this.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.049
"Coulson for M. Suitable subject."

13:11.165 --> 13:13.543
- M?
- Morland?

13:14.669 --> 13:19.266
I tracked him down. He's retired but still
sees patients now and again in his home.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.181
Maybe Coulson's one of them.

13:23.469 --> 13:27.019
Strange word. "Subject."

13:28.040 --> 13:30.044
'...for you today.

13:32.395 --> 13:36.241
'...people who suffer from depression
often feel they've always felt this way.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.530
'Like they're trapped in a cycle.'

13:38.651 --> 13:42.827
So, let's go through a typical
Chris day, shall we?

13:43.698 --> 13:45.120
I don't do anything.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.793
'You must do something.
It's impossible to do nothing.'

15:14.247 --> 15:15.499
Fuck!

15:16.374 --> 15:17.626
Fuck!

15:45.987 --> 15:49.787
You've been coming here
for over a month now, Chris, but...

15:51.117 --> 15:55.668
...you can't progress unless you start
to share a bit more about yourself.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.836
Is there anyone in your life
you have feelings for?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.971
There's a girl.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.973
And I, erm...

16:19.770 --> 16:21.943
...kind of like her I suppose.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.784
How did you meet her?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.581
We met at a university up north.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.126
I was older... Well, I am older than her.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.090
And she was in her... first year.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.180
And I didn't finish. I dropped out.

16:45.296 --> 16:50.518
And I was just hanging round university,
going to the bar.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.398
- Did you go out?
- No.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.684
No, she...

16:58.643 --> 17:01.237
She went out with a friend of mine, Jim.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.402
So that's, that's how I met her.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.280
Have you kept in touch with her?

17:08.152 --> 17:10.701
'No, not, not really.'

17:10.820 --> 17:14.541
I mean, I sometimes go over
to sort of that part of town

17:14.659 --> 17:18.414
because it's... it's, it's near
where I live anyway, so...

17:19.454 --> 17:21.082
What's she called?

17:23.334 --> 17:24.881
Kathleen.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.594
Her name's Kathleen.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.832
Timing! Got a light?

17:56.617 --> 17:58.790
Here you are.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.799
Can I have a draw on that?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.639
- Er...
- Wanna share some?

18:10.756 --> 18:12.178
Erm...

18:13.342 --> 18:16.016
I can't cos it's, er...
It's just that it's...

18:16.137 --> 18:20.142
Sorry, it's my last,
it's my last little bit, so, erm...

18:24.353 --> 18:26.276
So I haven't got much...

18:27.697 --> 18:29.526
I haven't got much left, so...

18:29.650 --> 18:32.779
- I only want a little bit.
- Er...

19:11.651 --> 19:13.498
'Hi, Mum.'

19:14.974 --> 19:16.939
'Yeah. Yeah, good.'

19:18.282 --> 19:21.627
'Yeah, actually, it's okay. Going well.'

19:23.053 --> 19:28.343
It's a, er... psychotherapist.
It's not a psychiatrist. Yeah.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.504
'A she. She... It's a...

19:31.629 --> 19:33.882
'Yeah, it's, it's a woman.

19:34.799 --> 19:38.394
'Yeah, well, you know, just...
just about stuff.'

19:42.682 --> 19:46.562
Hello, mate. Happy...
Fucking hell! Jesus, mate!

19:46.686 --> 19:49.439
I should've brought my hazard suit.
Christ, honestly.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.737
Open a window now and again.
Give the rats a fighting chance.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.533
- I'm kidding. How are you, man?
- Er, good.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.907
Look at this. The booze man cometh.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.244
All unwanted samples from work.
What is your <i>poisson?</i>

20:03.369 --> 20:07.249
We got, er... whisky, ouzo, vodka.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.001
What the fuck is this stuff? Here you are.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.345
- That's for you.
- Cheers.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.056
Overflowing with gratitude as ever, I see.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.302
Right, I can't stay. How's your, erm...

20:19.427 --> 20:21.600
Oh, yeah, yeah, good. It's better.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.769
Running. Seriously, mate, it works.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.563
Endorphins. Get yourself a good woman.

20:26.684 --> 20:30.312
Or even better,
get yourself a bad woman. Yeah?

20:30.396 --> 20:33.195
- All right, man.
- How's Kathleen?

20:33.315 --> 20:36.410
Yeah, she's good, yeah. We're good.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.407
I mean, we've had a few problems,
but, yeah...

20:41.490 --> 20:42.992
Yeah, it's good.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.412
- Drinks soon, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.210
Get up!

20:48.330 --> 20:50.128
- Ta-ra.
- See you, Jim.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.753
'What do you think about
when you're walking?'

20:53.878 --> 20:57.132
'Just, er... daydreams and stuff.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.518
'Dreaming I'm someone else.'

21:01.260 --> 21:04.560
Who are you in your dreams?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.938
A policeman.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.112
Like a...

21:12.229 --> 21:14.607
Like a police detective.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.485
Is that something
you would've liked to have done?

21:18.652 --> 21:20.325
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.666
And what have you done? For a living, I mean?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.290
Bits and pieces.

21:27.411 --> 21:31.416
Catering and... signing on at the moment.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.168
But in your daydreams you're...

21:35.252 --> 21:37.050
...someone more exciting.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.845
It's like I'm a policeman.

21:39.965 --> 21:44.516
And I've taken the blame for something.
Something wrong someone else has done.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.728
So I'm off the force, but I...

21:49.433 --> 21:53.233
...still solve crimes.

21:53.354 --> 21:57.484
It's really detailed in some ways
and really vague in others.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.241
Dreams are like that.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.157
Daydreams, too.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.308
Chris!

22:24.844 --> 22:27.643
Chris. Hey!

22:27.763 --> 22:30.312
- Hi.
- That's so funny.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.605
That's, like, the second time in this park.

22:32.726 --> 22:36.105
What are you doing?
You're not a kiddie-fiddler, are you?

22:36.830 --> 22:39.404
Are you out on your morning rounds?

22:39.525 --> 22:42.574
No, no. I come, er... I come here a lot.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.538
- Do you?
- Yeah.

22:44.655 --> 22:47.033
Don't you live three miles away or something?

22:47.157 --> 22:50.411
Mm... How's work?

22:51.537 --> 22:54.586
Erm, it's good, yeah. I've changed schools.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.506
So it's... it's better.
It's slightly better, yeah.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.173
How about you?

22:59.295 --> 23:03.516
Oh, you know,
I'm, I'm... er, in between things.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.146
Is that the same bracelet you had at uni?

23:09.263 --> 23:14.019
Yeah, it is.
What a strange thing to remember.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.076
Oh, I should get going.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.544
- It's good to see you.
- And you. Definitely.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.130
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.460
Fuck!

23:49.929 --> 23:54.184
'Sometimes I daydream
that I'm undercover in real life.

23:55.643 --> 23:59.614
'Like when I'm here,
I pretend I'm undercover,

23:59.730 --> 24:02.654
'and it's part of an investigation, you know?

24:05.486 --> 24:10.333
'When I'm walking I...
I pretend that I'm trailing someone

24:10.449 --> 24:12.451
'and it's part of a case.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.501
'It's harmless, I think.

24:18.666 --> 24:22.637
'I know it sounds weird, but I, erm...

24:24.672 --> 24:26.299
'I should probably stop.'

24:29.760 --> 24:33.014
Is Kathleen in these daydreams?

24:33.138 --> 24:36.893
Yeah, she's like a profiler,
like a psychological profiler,

24:37.017 --> 24:39.190
like forensics.

24:39.311 --> 24:43.316
Yeah. I mean, in real life, she's a teacher.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.614
Anyway, she's, she's really smart,
so it suits her.

24:47.945 --> 24:51.495
What about other people? Like Jim?

24:52.783 --> 24:56.413
Yeah, sometimes he's...
I mean, he's another cop.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.666
But in real life
he works for a drinks company.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.549
Erm, I know it's not real.

25:08.674 --> 25:12.929
I mean, it's nice, but...
I know it's not real.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.349
Hello, old chap.

27:16.176 --> 27:19.055
If I was a suspicious fellow,
I'd say you were following me.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.353
Er, no. I... Well, I just...

27:22.474 --> 27:26.399
Er, I've just seen you
at the therapy center a couple of times.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.067
I just thought I'd say hello.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.987
So you followed me halfway across London?

27:31.108 --> 27:35.614
Er, I'm... Yeah, I'm really...
I'm really sorry. Really, really sorry.

27:35.737 --> 27:39.833
Well, it's comforting to know
I'm not the nuttiest person in there.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.748
I can... Erm... Yeah. Er...

27:41.869 --> 27:46.340
- I better go. Sorry again.
- Hey, what's your name?

27:46.832 --> 27:47.924
Er...

27:48.834 --> 27:50.757
- It's Chris.
- Well, Chris...

27:50.878 --> 27:54.007
Why don't we grab a coffee? You can pay.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.634
Make up for the whole, you know...
stalking thing.

27:56.758 --> 28:00.012
- No, I better...
- Buy me a coffee or I'll call the police.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.770
Great.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.024
My name's Michael, by the way.
Michael Coulson.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.660
Come on.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.240
'Been to over a dozen therapists.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.868
'Each of them trying to find
the exact nature of the problem.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.212
'Outsmarted them all, of course.'

28:26.413 --> 28:28.541
Yeah, we're all in Hell.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.340
Some of us just don't remember
why we've been put there.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.555
There's more to her than meets the eye.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.139
- Who?
- Fisher.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.010
Not exactly clear what's going on, but, er...

28:40.135 --> 28:43.514
Let's just say she's not exactly
disinterested in her patients.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.314
You know, she wants me to see
another therapist? It's most odd.

28:47.434 --> 28:51.189
Says we'll be the perfect fit.
Very insistent. Won't let it drop.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.816
- Well, are you gonna go?
- Yeah, probably.

28:53.941 --> 28:56.569
Just out of curiosity
more than anything else.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.446
See who this super psychologist is.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.621
What's his name, the other therapist?

29:03.742 --> 29:07.963
Morland. Alexander Morland.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.253
It's quite a grandiose name, isn't it?

29:12.459 --> 29:15.053
Right, let's go back to Waterloo.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.973
- What Line do you need?
- Er, Northern.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.219
Oh, Christ. Wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.812
I'll get us a cab. I'll pay. Come on.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.933
'I'm really sorry, Chris.'

29:29.351 --> 29:31.900
I've just found out that I've got...

29:33.897 --> 29:35.365
I'm ill.

29:36.858 --> 29:40.829
It's quite serious, I'm afraid,
so I'm gonna have to take some time off.

29:40.946 --> 29:45.747
I'd like to recommend another person
you might consider seeing.

29:48.245 --> 29:53.001
It will give you continuity. You wouldn't
feel like you were starting from nothing.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.628
Christopher...

29:57.421 --> 30:00.174
I think we've made a lot of progress.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.595
This doctor's called Morland.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.643
Dr Alex Morland.

30:08.140 --> 30:13.021
When we study to become psychotherapists,
we have to undergo therapy ourselves.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.274
It's part of our training.

30:16.398 --> 30:19.527
And Alex, Dr Morland...

30:20.694 --> 30:22.446
...he was my therapist.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.541
Christopher?

30:28.952 --> 30:31.046
Will you consider it?

30:47.220 --> 30:50.941
'She says he's right for both of us.
Does that strike you as odd?'

30:51.058 --> 30:55.154
I just think she wants someone else
to pick up where she left off.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.318
Oh! That's a lot of pills.

30:57.439 --> 30:58.861
Oh. Yeah.

30:58.982 --> 31:02.236
I should, er... I should become a dealer.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.740
Well, it struck me as odd. Very odd.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.330
Oh, I, er... I was there, you know.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.957
At Morland's. Two days ago.

31:15.082 --> 31:19.007
I won't say any more.
I want to hear your first impressions.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.595
Chin-chin.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.565
Trousers down for half a crown!

32:13.682 --> 32:16.401
Christopher? Come in, come in.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.105
Let me take your coat.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.860
Usually, my man would be here to take it,
but he's on his annual day off.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.577
Did you get here okay?

32:25.694 --> 32:28.493
Er, yeah, sorry.
I was delayed, the... the train was...

32:28.613 --> 32:31.082
Nationalize the whole bloody thing, I say!

32:31.199 --> 32:33.293
Come up to my lair.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.175
Sorry. Place is a bloody mess.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.842
Sign of a creative mind. Or a lazy sod.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.932
Ah... Please, sit, sit.

32:47.841 --> 32:52.221
Now, just because we're plumbing
the depths of the unconscious mind,

32:52.345 --> 32:55.224
doesn't mean we can't have
a cup of tea or coffee?

32:55.348 --> 32:57.521
Er... tea, please.

32:58.310 --> 33:02.235
Normal tea or some sort of gay tea?
We've got the lot.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.608
- Er, normal, thanks.
- Coming up.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.718
There you go. Nectar of the gods.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.888
Now, then... How are you?

33:31.927 --> 33:33.520
Er... yeah. Fine.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.981
It's good of you to come out here
to the sticks.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.601
You'll find I have a bit
of a different approach to Dr Fisher.

33:39.726 --> 33:43.196
I don't believe in all this
awkward silence stuff, you see.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.816
If you don't say anything, I will.

33:45.941 --> 33:49.491
Most people start talking
sooner or later just to shut me up.

33:49.611 --> 33:53.661
Did you notice the books?
Seriously, he is into some weird shit.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.500
Mm-hm.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.290
Magic. The occult. Weird science.

33:57.410 --> 34:01.631
The bottle. There is a bottle. Ask him
about the bottle. Seriously, weird stuff.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.251
Talking of bottles...
Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah!

34:04.376 --> 34:08.552
One more. One more? One each.
Now, I've been tinkering and...

34:08.672 --> 34:12.722
You know, just researching online,
and all this stuff that Morland's into,

34:12.842 --> 34:15.686
anthropology, maths, magic,
it's all linked, all linked.

34:15.804 --> 34:19.478
- Mm, come to this thing tonight.
- Ah, nah. I don't...

34:19.599 --> 34:21.272
- Come on! Come to this thing!
- No.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.693
There's some really interesting people
I'd like you to meet.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.485
You'll get on like a house on fire.

34:29.359 --> 34:33.034
...and it was run by the CIA and the FBI.

34:33.154 --> 34:36.203
Wiretapping, infiltration, brainwashing...

34:36.324 --> 34:38.452
Don't talk to Danny. He'll fry your brain.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.831
This isn't some bullshit, mind you,
like the Illuminati,

34:41.955 --> 34:43.706
or lizard men at the South Pole...

34:53.341 --> 34:56.686
...Civil Rights Movement,
Black Panthers, Anti-Vietnam...

35:07.147 --> 35:11.277
It's heavy. It's like a child's body.

35:11.401 --> 35:14.871
A fat child. It's all in fifties.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.793
Course, I'm 19, right? I got no brains.

35:19.909 --> 35:23.004
I don't think to get a cab over to Gav's.
I get on the Tube.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.794
Fucking hell.

35:24.914 --> 35:28.714
I'm sat on the Tube with enough money
to buy a fucking house.

35:29.878 --> 35:33.007
Anyway, Gav's got this money counter

35:33.131 --> 35:36.226
off a mate's dad who owns a furniture store.

35:36.343 --> 35:39.017
There's 300 rolls of cash.

35:40.013 --> 35:43.233
It takes about an hour
cos the thing keeps jamming.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.520
And we get to the end...

35:48.229 --> 35:50.231
- ...and it's under.
- Fucking hell.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.486
So we go again, of course.
Takes another hour.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.990
We have to iron the fucking money
with Gav's mum's iron. Yeah?

36:00.408 --> 36:03.912
- And it's still under.
- What happens if it's not all there?

36:05.288 --> 36:09.259
- It has to be there.
- Yeah, but... what happens?

36:10.543 --> 36:12.090
It has to be there.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.965
But how does it benefit them to beat you up

36:15.090 --> 36:18.094
or worse if it's not...

36:18.218 --> 36:20.596
It has to fucking be there!

36:23.348 --> 36:26.022
So the machine's fucked,
we'll have to count it by hand.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.860
We've got a wrap of speed on us.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.823
And, I don't know, hours later,
the sun's coming up,

36:31.940 --> 36:34.318
our fingers and wrists
are fucking killing us.

36:34.442 --> 36:38.242
We can't see straight,
we're grinding our teeth, we're crying.

36:38.363 --> 36:41.663
We're laughing hysterically at nothing.

36:41.783 --> 36:46.084
We're tapping our toes to the banging
of the fucking central heating.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.753
And it's still under.

36:49.499 --> 36:53.970
So what do we do? Do we run? Where do we go?

36:54.087 --> 36:57.842
I mean, we seriously entertained
going down to the south of France.

36:59.300 --> 37:03.851
I go to the toilet...
put some water on my face.

37:04.764 --> 37:10.362
And I come back, and I find Gav on his knees.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.366
And he's...

37:16.067 --> 37:17.569
He's praying.

37:17.694 --> 37:21.244
So I'm about to fuck off, leave him to it.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.500
And then I think...

37:25.577 --> 37:27.250
...fuck it.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.959
What have I got to lose?

37:35.253 --> 37:40.805
So we're both knelt on the floor,
all this ironed cash lying around,

37:40.925 --> 37:44.099
and we're fucking praying to God knows who.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.724
God? Allah? Buddha?

37:49.058 --> 37:51.937
Satan? Odin? Zeus?

37:52.061 --> 37:54.689
Any cunt that will fucking listen.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.693
The following morning,
we agreed to go round there,

37:58.818 --> 38:03.824
just come straight out with it and hope
he sees in our eyes that it wasn't us.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.327
So we go over, we show him
round the back of the club,

38:07.452 --> 38:12.003
and, Hill... I will never forget this
for as long as I live...

38:12.123 --> 38:16.754
he's watering potted plants
listening to Radio 2, barely looks at us.

38:16.878 --> 38:19.427
I give the bag over to his Neanderthal...

38:22.050 --> 38:25.520
...and we totally fucking chicken out
about telling him.

38:29.224 --> 38:34.025
For two days, we sat in Gav's flat
staring into space,

38:35.605 --> 38:37.699
waiting for the hammer to fall.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.160
A week later...

38:42.654 --> 38:45.578
...Hill and the rest of the gang went down.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.503
For life.

38:52.789 --> 38:55.417
Now, I don't care what anyone fucking says.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.842
Somebody heard us.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.356
Anyone else got any stories?

39:19.065 --> 39:22.160
How do you know you're not
really an undercover cop?

39:22.277 --> 39:24.325
Sorry. What?

39:26.072 --> 39:29.918
How do you know if they haven't
messed with your head somehow

39:30.034 --> 39:34.380
and you really are an undercover cop,
but you think you're a normal person?

39:35.915 --> 39:37.508
S... Who?

39:37.625 --> 39:41.471
Hypnosis. Implanted memories.
Shrinks, man, they're head-shrinkers.

39:41.588 --> 39:45.343
- How do you know about that?
- Cos you told me you went to a shrink.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.640
And you fantasize
about being an undercover cop.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.729
Fucking hell, I thought I was stoned.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.770
Have you been talking to... Where's Michael?

39:52.891 --> 39:56.737
What I'm saying is,
what if you really are an undercover cop?

39:56.853 --> 40:00.403
You're just imagining
that you're a normal person.

40:00.523 --> 40:04.869
You went in too deep and they flipped you
and now you can't get out.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.399
Hiya.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.360
I'm Maria, by the way.

42:09.485 --> 42:10.862
Hi.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.493
Thanks.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.673
Do I have to write my number on my forehead?

42:31.632 --> 42:33.134
No. Sorry.

42:35.178 --> 42:36.555
Right...

42:53.821 --> 42:56.540
- What's that?
- Hm?

42:57.784 --> 42:59.161
Ah, that?

43:02.038 --> 43:04.917
That is a Klein bottle.

43:05.666 --> 43:08.886
Yes, yes. Lovely object.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.882
It has a non-orientable surface.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.350
A closed manifold.

43:14.467 --> 43:18.438
Plain English: it's got no inside or outside.

43:18.554 --> 43:22.058
Look, if you go in a straight line
and keep going,

43:22.183 --> 43:25.778
you end up on the opposite side
of the glass from where you were.

43:25.895 --> 43:31.243
The outside becomes the inside,
and the inside becomes the outside.

43:32.568 --> 43:35.868
Of course, a real one can only exist
in four dimensions.

43:36.614 --> 43:40.118
It's like a bottle version of a Möbius strip.

43:41.661 --> 43:45.040
Oh, Christ. Well, we'll start there.

43:45.915 --> 43:48.759
Look, you tear off a strip of paper.

43:50.336 --> 43:51.713
Twist it.

43:52.421 --> 43:56.346
And if you start on one side and keep going,

43:56.467 --> 43:58.595
you end up on the other side.

43:58.719 --> 44:02.223
Imagine an ant wandering along the strip.

44:02.348 --> 44:05.318
He'd end up back where he started,

44:05.434 --> 44:09.439
without ever crossing an edge
or turning back.

44:09.564 --> 44:11.737
Pretty weird for the ant.

44:12.567 --> 44:17.289
A bit like the ouroboros,
which goes back to the Egyptians.

44:17.405 --> 44:20.033
Then the medieval alchemists
made it their own.

44:20.158 --> 44:24.504
Then it was Jung's favorite,
the eternal return, and all that.

44:25.037 --> 44:28.462
You'll find I'm quite open to woolly ideas.

44:28.583 --> 44:31.336
Not a bad trait
for a psychotherapist, I think.

44:32.253 --> 44:34.972
- What's that?
- Hm? Oh, that?

44:35.089 --> 44:38.514
That's a sigil. It's a magical symbol.

44:38.634 --> 44:41.308
I've had it so long, I don't even notice it.

44:41.429 --> 44:43.898
You write down a wish or a desire,

44:44.015 --> 44:47.019
then combine the letters into a symbol.

44:47.143 --> 44:49.441
It's supposed to make the wish come true.

44:49.562 --> 44:52.736
I made it when I had...
I had a bit of a health scare.

44:52.857 --> 44:55.076
Oh, a decade ago now.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.321
And I'm still here.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.914
It'd be tempting fate to take it down.

45:00.698 --> 45:04.202
Ah, who knows?
Looks nice, though, doesn't it?

45:19.759 --> 45:22.433
'Chris, don't go to Morland. He's dangerous.

45:22.553 --> 45:26.103
'Look, come over. I'll explain, okay?
Yeah, come over.'

45:40.613 --> 45:43.662
'This is Michael Coulson.
You know what to do.'

46:04.720 --> 46:07.599
Right, let's get out of here, shall we?

46:07.723 --> 46:10.818
Well, we're not getting anywhere
sat here, are we?

46:10.935 --> 46:13.108
Come on.

46:22.655 --> 46:25.408
Getting better is a creative process.

46:25.533 --> 46:29.083
It doesn't do to keep banging your head
against the wall for too long.

46:29.203 --> 46:33.208
It's not scientific.
Not in the modern sense, anyway.

46:35.084 --> 46:38.463
Don't get me wrong,
I've got nothing against rationalism.

46:38.587 --> 46:40.260
When I get on a plane,

46:40.381 --> 46:43.681
I hope to bloody God
the engineers are rationalists.

46:43.801 --> 46:47.601
But this, what we're doing,
trying to get you better...

46:49.390 --> 46:51.768
...that's alchemy.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.769
Mind your step.

47:00.901 --> 47:03.950
Right here, where we stand right now,

47:04.071 --> 47:07.120
is the center of the magical world.

47:07.241 --> 47:09.369
Of course, that's true of anywhere.

47:09.493 --> 47:12.292
But right in this clearing, a few years back,

47:12.413 --> 47:16.259
they found a witch bottle,
17th century probably.

47:16.375 --> 47:19.504
It had a heart with a nail in it.

47:19.628 --> 47:25.055
William Blake wrote "The Book of Thel"
about, oh, 30 miles that way.

47:25.176 --> 47:30.979
John Dee practiced alchemy about
100 miles that way, 500 years back.

47:31.724 --> 47:35.945
And in woods very like these,
the New Forest, 1940,

47:36.062 --> 47:40.067
Gerald Gardner and
a coven of witches, the good kind,

47:40.191 --> 47:44.037
performed a ritual to stop Hitler invading.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.326
They stripped naked, danced,

47:46.447 --> 47:51.169
and chanted, "You cannot cross the sea!
You cannot come!"

47:52.328 --> 47:54.046
It worked.

47:54.163 --> 47:56.382
Well, it worked for them.

47:56.499 --> 48:01.676
Made them feel better about how the war
was going and their place in it.

48:01.796 --> 48:05.596
Who knows? Maybe it really did work.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.810
He never did come, did he?

48:09.220 --> 48:10.688
Come on.

48:11.555 --> 48:13.398
<i>Schnell.</i>

48:13.516 --> 48:16.395
A lot of what I do is trying to distract you,

48:16.519 --> 48:18.729
rather like a stage magician.

48:18.813 --> 48:22.067
Only, the rabbit I'm trying to pull
from the hat

48:22.191 --> 48:24.489
is the solution to your depression.

48:25.486 --> 48:28.615
That's what we have to crack
with you, Christopher.

48:28.739 --> 48:32.243
You have to believe you can get better.

48:34.370 --> 48:36.418
Come on. Tea.

48:37.248 --> 48:40.052
'This is Michael Coulson.
You know what to do.'

48:47.174 --> 48:49.427
'Either you tell me what's bothering you

48:49.552 --> 48:53.273
'or I'm going to start banging on
about alchemy and maths again.'

48:53.389 --> 48:56.233
'I don't know what else to say.
I've told you everything.'

48:56.350 --> 48:59.604
It's not about that. It's not about that.

48:59.728 --> 49:01.981
Look, I... Do you know what? I'm too tired.

49:02.106 --> 49:06.361
I'm too tired. I can't do this right now.

49:06.485 --> 49:07.862
Really.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.541
'What is this thing that's
making you so unhappy?'

49:11.657 --> 49:14.376
'It's depression. It's clinical depression.'

49:14.493 --> 49:17.087
- That's just a name. Pick another one.
- What?

49:17.204 --> 49:20.549
Call it Derek or Tony.
Or Mary if you want. Just name it.

49:20.666 --> 49:24.045
But it had better do it justice,
so maybe not a normal Christian name,

49:24.170 --> 49:25.843
but give it a name.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.886
I... I can't. It's...

49:28.007 --> 49:30.851
"Clinical depression" is someone
else's name. Give it your own name.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.891
This is stupid.

49:34.054 --> 49:38.651
You call it "clinical depression",
you're locked into seeing it that way.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.189
So call it something else.

49:40.311 --> 49:44.032
Give yourself a chance to look at it
from another perspective.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.369
You said you were interested in magic.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.705
Well, that's all magicians are doing.

49:50.821 --> 49:53.119
When a magician raises a demon or an angel,

49:53.240 --> 49:55.242
it may only be real in his head,

49:55.367 --> 50:00.123
but if it's real to him,
it may as well be real, full stop.

50:00.247 --> 50:03.171
If he makes it into something tangible,

50:03.292 --> 50:05.886
then he can deal with what it represents.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.552
It's the process that matters.

50:09.673 --> 50:14.725
We're trying to raise up whatever it is
that's got you in its grip,

50:14.845 --> 50:16.939
so we can deal with it.

50:23.646 --> 50:25.694
Let's have another brew.

51:21.829 --> 51:25.754
'I know what it's called. I know its name.

51:28.127 --> 51:29.595
'The Ghoul.'

51:37.219 --> 51:39.472
Can you describe it?

51:40.681 --> 51:42.149
It... It...

51:43.142 --> 51:47.192
It comes out and I... I can't get rid of it.

51:49.106 --> 51:52.406
It can be anywhere it wants to be.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.199
And it...

51:59.325 --> 52:01.703
It hollows you out and it...

52:03.746 --> 52:05.248
...clings to you.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.961
Other people can see it.

52:10.085 --> 52:13.430
They see it on you
and they're frightened to come near

52:13.547 --> 52:17.643
in case it leaps off you and onto them.

52:21.764 --> 52:23.858
So they stay away.

52:26.644 --> 52:29.989
And... that's what it wants.

52:33.942 --> 52:35.615
Is it here now?

52:44.370 --> 52:46.464
Does it know I'm here?

52:51.960 --> 52:54.338
Does it want me to be here?

52:56.340 --> 52:58.843
It needs me to be alone.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.107
But you're not alone, Chris.

53:09.228 --> 53:11.902
You may feel like it, but you're not.

53:15.776 --> 53:18.279
It hasn't beaten you yet, Christopher.

53:21.281 --> 53:24.410
And it's been trying for years.

54:59.957 --> 55:05.223
- Sorry, Chris. It's so embarrassing.
- It's okay. Don't worry. It's fine.

55:05.344 --> 55:08.689
I didn't expect to cry my fucking eyes out.

55:10.307 --> 55:13.982
He's such a f... fucking arsehole.

55:14.770 --> 55:16.147
Yeah.

55:18.871 --> 55:20.513
- Sorry, Chris.
- It's fine.

55:20.633 --> 55:25.126
- I'm sorry. I'm really embarrassed.
- Don't worry. It's fi... It's fine.

55:25.247 --> 55:27.575
- Please don't worry.
- Thanks.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.918
Really. Thank you.

55:31.703 --> 55:33.080
Okay...

55:34.456 --> 55:36.550
That's, that's fine.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.140
I... I probably best get going.

55:46.468 --> 55:48.562
I'll... Yeah, I'll just...

56:12.661 --> 56:14.880
They're gods, they're gods...

56:20.711 --> 56:23.089
Come in, come in, come in.

56:23.213 --> 56:26.433
I've been working very hard.
I've been working very hard.

56:26.550 --> 56:31.522
And I've worked it out,
Morland and Fisher's plan, their purpose.

56:31.638 --> 56:33.640
But there's a lot of work to do.

56:33.765 --> 56:37.861
...people with vulnerable minds, and
they'll go one by one through their patients

56:37.978 --> 56:40.731
until they find the right one.
One by one by one by one!

56:40.856 --> 56:45.111
And Morland, the stuff he's into,
magic, the occult and mathematics,

56:45.235 --> 56:47.954
loops, circles, cycles,
origins of consciousness,

56:48.071 --> 56:49.698
he's been studying this for years.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.121
Hang on, I've got something.

56:58.081 --> 57:01.051
Fisher's job, her plan, her purpose...

57:02.044 --> 57:05.173
She plans and she picks the patients.

57:05.297 --> 57:07.516
If you believe something,
it might as well be real!

57:07.633 --> 57:12.184
They believe that they can create
a loop inside a person's mind.

57:12.304 --> 57:15.774
They can live inside the loop!
They can move and they can change!

57:15.891 --> 57:19.646
Fisher is dying. Fisher's got cancer.
He hasn't got long. He's old.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.899
What they're planning to do
is prolong their life.

57:23.023 --> 57:25.742
No one believes that he's a sorcerer.

57:25.859 --> 57:29.454
And Fisher, her job, overall, is a protégée.

57:29.571 --> 57:32.450
A pupil procurer that procures patients!

57:32.574 --> 57:35.578
What they're doing is creating
a universe of the mind!

57:35.702 --> 57:38.330
- Basically, they're gods. They are gods!
- Stop!

57:38.455 --> 57:40.332
They are gods. They are gods.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.959
They are gods!

57:42.501 --> 57:45.846
'Oh, God. It just sounds so alarming.'

57:51.259 --> 57:54.388
- Horrible to see someone so unhappy.
- Yeah.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.729
What about you?

58:01.853 --> 58:04.572
Well, you were so unhappy a while back.

58:07.442 --> 58:09.945
I don't know. I'm getting there.

58:10.070 --> 58:12.243
Oh, I should've seen it coming.

58:13.156 --> 58:15.659
It's not the first time.

58:16.410 --> 58:19.664
He's strayed a couple of times since uni.

58:21.623 --> 58:24.092
I loved Manchester, you know.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.094
I went back to visit a couple of months back.

58:30.215 --> 58:36.097
And just driving up the motorway,
seeing signs to the North,

58:36.221 --> 58:38.940
it felt so good.

58:42.519 --> 58:45.272
I don't think I'll stay in London
much longer.

58:47.607 --> 58:50.611
I'd like it if you stayed.

58:55.282 --> 58:57.410
Is, er... is that a new dress?

58:58.577 --> 59:01.080
Yeah, it is, actually. Do you like it?

59:01.204 --> 59:03.081
- Yeah.
- I...

59:03.206 --> 59:05.334
Dunno. I might take it back.

59:06.835 --> 59:11.511
I've got this, erm... tag gun.
You know like they have in the shop?

59:11.631 --> 59:14.805
If you change your mind,
you just stick the tag back in the dress.

59:14.926 --> 59:16.803
You just take it back, no questions asked.

59:16.928 --> 59:18.396
- That's crafty.
- I know.

59:18.513 --> 59:23.064
Are you sure you should be in charge
of children? You're like a super villain.

59:36.948 --> 59:39.121
'You seem better.'

59:40.410 --> 59:42.287
'Yeah.'

59:42.412 --> 59:45.006
'You were in a bad way when we first met.'

59:47.000 --> 59:48.718
I was in hell.

59:49.711 --> 59:51.884
Is that how it felt?

59:52.005 --> 59:55.760
We're all in hell. We just can't
remember how we got here.

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.184
- Where did you hear that?
- Sorry?

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.854
That phrase. What you just said.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:06.732
Someone just said it once.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:09.606
This friend of yours,
who's having a breakdown,

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:12.405
is it Michael Coulson?

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.620
No. Yeah, yeah.

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:18.495
Christopher, how long have you been
friends with Michael Coulson?

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.834
I don't know. I just...

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.875
- We just met after a session once. Why?
- Christopher...

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:28.671
It's very important that you don't have
anything to do with Michael Coulson.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.295
Look, I know he's manic depressive, but...

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:33.092
- Christopher...
- He's fine...

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:37.013
Michael Coulson is not
a manic depressive. He's dangerous.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:41.435
- I've seen his medicine.
- Oh, have you seen the bottles?

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.058
- Seen the labels on the bottles?
- No. I didn't.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:48.278
Would you know what medication someone
with bipolar disorder takes anyway?

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.943
Christopher,

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:59.073
sometimes you encounter a person
who is bad for you to be around.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:02.997
Michael Coulson is
one of those people for you.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.461
I don't understand.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.331
You know I can't share information
about a patient,

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:10.584
but I must tell you Michael Coulson is not...

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:18.138
He's very adept at putting ideas
in people's heads.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:22.308
You must promise me
that you'll stay away from him.

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:28.609
Christopher?

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.618
That's enough for today.

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:21.038
What is this place?

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.624
Sometimes I work in property management.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.335
It's quite interesting.
All these "Mary Celeste" houses.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.546
Places where people have died.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.130
Sometimes Tommy needs somewhere
for one of his mysterious bags.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.504
They come in quite useful.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.552
You know Morland and Fisher
are working together?

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.801
- Michael...
- No, no, no, Christopher...

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:45.600
I'm not low, I'm not manic.
I can see clearly.

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:50.893
They're trying to get inside your head
and they'll drop you if they can't use you.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:56.774
Fisher's out there now looking
for someone more susceptible.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:03:01.153
At first, they thought it was you, but...
now they realize that you're strong,

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.372
they're gonna drop you.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.625
Something needs to be done about them.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:20.555
I am sorry, Christopher.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:24.597
I've had some... some bad news.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.937
I know this is a tough time for you, too.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:35.946
But I'm gonna have to take some time off.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.283
A colleague...

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:47.833
...actually a close friend of mine...

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.744
...is very ill.

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.251
Cancer.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:56.716
This course of treatment lasts three weeks.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:00.841
My friend will need some rest after that.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:10.055
It's been good
to get to know you, Christopher.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.438
'If only we had more time.'

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.121
- 'Hello?'
- Hi, it's Chris.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.829
'Come in. What have you been up to?'

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.751
I saw Michael.

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:39.964
Erm, he's better, but he's still...

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:43.214
you know, strange and distant, but better.

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:45.557
Good. Good.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:47.971
- It's good, isn't it?
- Mm.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:59.984
Look, erm... I bought those tickets
for that thing, er... the play.

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:01.607
Okay.

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:06.245
Erm, I was gonna call and... ask,

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.581
but I knew you were at school,
so I bought them anyway.

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:12.541
Do you want a cup of tea?

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.752
- Yeah.
- Erm...

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.667
Chris, erm...

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.674
I'm really sorry.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:28.263
I feel like I've given you
completely the wrong idea.

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.056
No, it's...

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:33.646
- I've blown hot and cold.
- No, it's fine.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:36.562
- It's fine.
- I just think, to be honest, I've...

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.936
I've felt really confused.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.028
Fine. Look, I'm...

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:46.318
I'm big enough and ugly enough to...
you know...

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:24.252
'Sometimes I'll review... Nothing
about you leaves this practice...

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.831
'Trapped in a cycle... '

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.756
'Dr Morland, he was my therapist.'

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:38.843
'...we're plumbing the depths
of the unconscious... Got no inside or...'

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:43.846
'...outside becomes the inside
and the inside becomes the outside.'

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:48.018
'The inside becomes the outside.'

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.659
'You know what to do.'

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.467
Hi. Okay.

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:22.847
Come in.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.268
- Chris!
- Do you want a cup of tea?

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:29.604
I'll make us a cup of tea, eh?

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:35.606
You all right, mate?

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:48.456
Well, look, I've gotta get packed, so, erm...

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.877
It's nice to see you, Chris.

01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:10.136
Why are you packing?

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:14.265
I got that job I went up for up north.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.688
- Is Jim going?
- Yeah.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:20.442
He's got himself a placement up there.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:28.659
Chris, are you okay?

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.124
They're trying to make themselves immortal.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.045
And I'm gonna stop them.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.302
Alex? What is it?

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.050
Stay here.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:15.470
Christopher... It's okay.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.272
Helen, it's okay. Go back up.

01:15:22.693 --> 01:15:24.487
Helen...

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:28.028
Christopher, it's okay. Christopher...

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:30.868
- You're trying to make a loop of my mind!
- Christopher!

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:33.158
- I don't know...
- To make a loop.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:36.909
Christopher, I need you to put the gun down.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:40.162
- Christopher, I want to help you.
- Shut up. Shut up!

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.038
Christopher...

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:06.737
- You turned out well, Christopher.
- We won, Alex.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:11.075
You were on the road approaching
London trying to get up north.

01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:13.069
But you'll never reach her.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:16.414
You're approaching London right now.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:20.330
We won! We won!

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:23.646
We won!

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.185
Shit.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.405
No, no, no!
