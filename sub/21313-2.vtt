00:45.790 --> 00:47.951
A family is like a small business.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.044
And with a small business,
at times, there comes...

00:52.130 --> 00:53.757
-Transition.
-...a bit of a transition.

00:53.840 --> 00:54.829
Thank you, Wendy.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.332
And... and whenever
a small busmess tranSItIons,

00:57.430 --> 00:59.637
it's important to stay lean
and to not overextend.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.961
So when did the Marriott
become such a stretch?

01:02.060 --> 01:04.722
No, your father, he's just saying
we have to prioritize our spending.

01:04.810 --> 01:07.051
-That's all, Charlotte. That's all.
-He's not saying anything.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.641
Uh, so today,
while your mom is buying us a new house,

01:09.730 --> 01:12.528
uh, you two are to plant yourselves here.
That is your job.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.851
Everything we have of value
is in that room.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.406
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:17.490 --> 01:19.902
You're not gonna be honest with us?
Either of you?

01:20.450 --> 01:22.827
What are we doing here? Enough already!

01:22.910 --> 01:24.821
- Christ!

01:24.910 --> 01:27.993
Sorry, man. We're just
finishing up breakfast. Thank you.

01:32.210 --> 01:35.043
No one goes in that room
whose last name is not Byrde.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.296
Understood?

01:39.590 --> 01:40.887
-Just nod.
-Yeah.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.597
Thank you. Shall we?

01:44.970 --> 01:48.224
And I'd love to not have to turn the room
upsrde down to find the clicker.

01:49.650 --> 01:50.935
That wasn't fun.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.679
Love you both.

01:58.570 --> 02:01.448
- Maybe I should get a job.
- I don't think so, Wendy.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.112
Seven and a half bu_cks an hour is not
gonna put a dent In our problems.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.498
Oh, come on.
I have a Master's degree.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.571
That you haven't used
since Charlotte was born.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.989
- So?
- So?

02:11.710 --> 02:14.952
-What's our story for the kids?
-What do you mean?

02:15.050 --> 02:18.258
Well, they see this polite dance
that we're doing in front of them.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.717
They... they hear the constant edge
in your voice.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.302
Well, we could tell them the truth, Wendy.
How would that be?

02:24.890 --> 02:26.551
Oh, you know what, Marty?

02:26.640 --> 02:29.097
Before you get too comfortable
up there on your cross,

02:29.190 --> 02:33.012
and have your pity party, let me just...
let me just jog your memory for a minute.

02:33.110 --> 02:36.068
There was an innocent man
who was murdered.

02:37.650 --> 02:38.639
Gary.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.520
He was a good man.

02:42.780 --> 02:46.159
He... he only did good things
in this world. Not like Bruce.

02:46.830 --> 02:49.958
Gary was a father. He had two grown sons.

02:50.460 --> 02:53.998
I never met them, but I...
I know he loved them.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.912
And... he was thrown off his balcony.

02:59.090 --> 03:00.375
For what?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.347
People cheat!

03:06.810 --> 03:09.973
They have sex with people
who they aren't married to.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.221
It happens. It's not unique.

03:13.770 --> 03:16.568
I was unhappy.
You're not exactly blameless in this.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.278
For this house, I want you to find one
as nice as possible,

03:20.360 --> 03:23.158
but as cheap as possible.
I want you to think starter home.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.902
We got $20,000 to our name. Just 20.

03:25.990 --> 03:29.539
So please, do not sign anything
without talking to me ﬁrst.

03:30.750 --> 03:35.585
And we are not husband and wife...
anymore.

03:36.170 --> 03:39.128
We're just business partners.
And our job is to raise those kids.

03:39.210 --> 03:41.792
But you're absolutely right
that I share some blame for this.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.869
I should've caught Bruce.

03:42.970 --> 03:45.347
I was in charge of the numbers.
I should've seen it coming.

03:45.430 --> 03:47.807
But my mind was elsewhere, Wendy.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.590
You know, it's Saturday night...

03:50.680 --> 03:53.558
and your... your foxy boxing,
or your Zumba,

03:53.650 --> 03:56.687
or whatever the hell it is that costs me
a few hundred dollars every month,

03:56.770 --> 03:59.227
it ended two hours ago,
and there's no Wendy.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.106
Why does she get so many texts
every night?

04:02.190 --> 04:03.851
Why does she have to leave the room
to make a call?

04:03.950 --> 04:06.771
I wonder who's fucking my wife?
So that's my bad.

04:07.870 --> 04:09.440
And, no, I... I don't forget Gary.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.440
I don't forget
how you emptied our bank accounts

04:11.540 --> 04:13.531
when you knew I needed that money, Wendy.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.997
You knew I needed it.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.742
And I doubt very, very much
that you did that by yourself,

04:18.840 --> 04:22.503
that you did that in a vacuum.
So... my memory's crystal clear.

04:22.590 --> 04:24.467
I was there. For all of it.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.298
In fact, the satisfying sound
of your lover smacking the pavement

04:29.390 --> 04:31.381
is the only thing
that gets me to sleep every night.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.931
Open the goddamn door!

05:02.670 --> 05:03.910
Hello?

05:07.390 --> 05:09.426
Excuse me, is there anybody here?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.808
Oh, yeah.

05:11.890 --> 05:13.926
Don't be shy, you know what to do.

05:14.020 --> 05:17.057
Come on, baby.
It's all for you, just gobble it up.

05:17.690 --> 05:20.318
Oh, yeah. Get after it.

05:21.230 --> 05:22.140
--Hey!

05:24.150 --> 05:26.812
Hey, um... I'm Sam Dermody.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.901
Uh, sorry, it's... You know,
people are out for lunch right now.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.072
- Um, but...

05:35.540 --> 05:39.169
-Sorry, it keeps me awake when nobody's--
-I could give a fuck.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.376
I need a house.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.456
Get yourself together.
Give your girl some water.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.791
-I'll meet you outside.
-Yeah, you got it.

05:50.390 --> 05:51.539
Hey, housekeeping?

05:52.350 --> 05:54.716
Yeah, no need to go in there. Thank you.

05:55.270 --> 05:56.305
How about the towels?

05:56.390 --> 05:58.221
You can just leave them
outside of the door.

06:05.940 --> 06:07.146
Thank you.

06:07.740 --> 06:12.109
I've been to the Windy City.
Oprah, December '97.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.784
Thought it'd be her Christmas show,
you know, the one with all the free swag?

06:15.870 --> 06:18.703
- Mmm-hmm.
- No. Race.

06:18.790 --> 06:23.238
She traipses out a bunch of colored folks,
mad over what, I still couldn't tell you.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.879
Police, I think.
Walk a mile in my Crocs, I say.

06:27.970 --> 06:28.959
Yep.

06:29.050 --> 06:31.792
Past clue business licenses. Deeds.

06:32.390 --> 06:34.096
Delinquent taxes.

06:34.180 --> 06:39.800
Bankruptcies, judgments,
property titles, liens and plat maps.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.096
All public record.

06:41.190 --> 06:44.148
If you need any copies, let me know.
Ten cents a page.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.107
Yeah, thank you. I'll be busy.

06:47.150 --> 06:49.061
Tell me again what it is you're doin'.

06:49.820 --> 06:51.811
I am an angel investor.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.980
I... I help turn around
struggling businesses.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.403
You intend to make money
off of businesses that aren't making any?

06:58.660 --> 06:59.866
In a roundabout way.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.489
Hmm.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.245
Best get some ice on that lip.

07:04.630 --> 07:05.949
Mm, yeah.

07:13.010 --> 07:16.889
There are_a lot of innovative ideas
In self storage.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.018
You park your boat
or put your shit in a shed,

07:20.100 --> 07:22.182
lock it up and walk away.
What am I missing?

07:22.770 --> 07:25.011
Well, a lot of clichs are clichs
for good reason,

07:25.110 --> 07:28.068
and one of them is,
"You need money to make money,"

07:28.150 --> 07:31.062
in my opinion.
Um, and I could be that money.

07:31.150 --> 07:34.313
You would get to hold on
to 100% ownership.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.446
In return for what?

07:36.530 --> 07:40.114
Well, I would control the finances,
uh, the accounting,

07:40.200 --> 07:41.827
investment oversight...

07:42.710 --> 07:43.779
Stuff like that.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.286
I would get to recoup
100% on my investment.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.701
I'd get two-and-a-half percent of...

07:49.550 --> 07:51.256
-you know, the net profits.
-Mm.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.831
Sir, you are delinquent on...
on your property taxes...

07:53.930 --> 07:57.047
and you got those
tenants that are suing you.

07:57.140 --> 08:00.678
I think there's three of them, yeah?
Maybe this could work for both of us.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.260
Plus, I'll tell you what...

08:03.060 --> 08:05.437
I bet it would feel a lot better
if I wasn't just an investor,

08:05.520 --> 08:07.226
and I was also a client.

08:07.310 --> 08:10.188
I... I'm looking for storage space myself.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.319
So, um, if that's a unit right there,
I will take that big one,

08:14.410 --> 08:17.698
and I will deal with
whatever's on the inside of it for...

08:17.780 --> 08:19.782
how about 75 bucks a month?

08:20.330 --> 08:21.194
What do you say?

08:21.790 --> 08:24.748
-Hundred.
-One hundred.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.209
"Got to spend money to make money."
That how that went?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.246
That's what I said. Yeah.

08:31.630 --> 08:32.836
All right.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.218
Court pays me to store evidence.

08:35.300 --> 08:38.042
Nobody claims it, I inherit it.

08:38.560 --> 08:42.018
Guy cut the tip of a pontoon off,
put it on a hinge.

08:50.730 --> 08:54.188
Thought he'd smuggle methamphetamines
to and fro across the lake.

08:54.780 --> 08:59.274
'Course, you put six tweakers
on a pontoon boat, all wild-eyed,

08:59.370 --> 09:03.158
and racing about, and yammering at once,

09:03.250 --> 09:05.866
bound to raise the eyebrow
of the Water Patrol.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.088
Not a fishing pole
or a cooler of soda pop for a cover.

09:09.170 --> 09:11.627
-Hm.
-Let that be a lesson to you.

09:11.710 --> 09:15.123
Okay. Okay. All right.

09:16.050 --> 09:17.426
Well, uh...

09:18.470 --> 09:20.927
Where you going?
What about our business arrangement?

09:21.010 --> 09:23.638
No arrangement.
You rented storage from me. End of story.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.018
Oh, come on now.
Your operating costs are fixed, sir.

09:27.100 --> 09:31.139
We could invest in stackable storage,
and refrigerated units--

09:31.230 --> 09:33.278
I'm an old dog.
New tricks don't appeal to me.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.896
Rent's clue on the first, skipper.

09:47.410 --> 09:50.459
...cash investment where you, uh,
you really can build out

09:50.540 --> 09:53.452
and reinvest maybe,
you know, in a whole new boat.

09:53.550 --> 09:54.585
Could do a color here.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.380
If there's more product in here,

10:04.470 --> 10:06.518
and a little better lighting,
it will get more people in.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.635
The aesthetic can come up

10:07.730 --> 10:11.052
and then the clientele can come up
a little bit, and you'd be surprised...

10:11.150 --> 10:12.856
You know, your name's right here. Sir?

10:12.940 --> 10:14.180
You can put it right down here.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.741
Come here. Okay.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.495
Let's take a look at this bad boy.

10:37.210 --> 10:39.041
Okay. Yeah.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.679
Manager wanted me to make sure
you still had one of these in your room.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.638
-Yeah, we're all set.
-Sure?

11:29.730 --> 11:32.688
It's chock-full of, uh...

11:32.770 --> 11:35.819
...clever-sounding,
overly-judgmental one-liners.

11:36.940 --> 11:38.020
Yeah, look, Wyatt, is it?

11:38.110 --> 11:40.647
I really don't wanna have to
get you fired today, okay?

11:40.740 --> 11:43.527
Well, if you could,
I'd have to thank you.

11:44.450 --> 11:46.361
This job's my old man's idea.

11:46.950 --> 11:50.033
Something about "calluses and character."

11:50.120 --> 11:53.078
Yeah, well, you're blowing leaves,
not hiding Anne Frank.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.458
I doubt that that argument resonates
with a Baptist Kansas City lawyer,

11:57.540 --> 11:59.041
but I'll give it a go.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.212
-Your dad's a lawyer?
-Yeah.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.336
We've got a, uh, summer home out here.

12:03.430 --> 12:06.422
And, uh, well,
I'm going to Mizzou in the fall.

12:06.510 --> 12:08.341
-Mm. _
-Dad's not happy about my major,

12:08.430 --> 12:12.878
so he's hoping I'll have some, like,
come-to-Jesus summer and switch.

12:13.690 --> 12:16.762
-What about you?
-We're from Chicago.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.818
My dad's in ﬁnance,
but clearly he's just cheap.

12:21.110 --> 12:23.852
Anyway. Three and I
are going wakeboarding in a little bit,

12:23.950 --> 12:25.406
if you guys wanna come along.

12:25.990 --> 12:28.527
Leaving in, like, 20 minutes.
I don't know.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.576
Better than sitting around here all day.

12:36.330 --> 12:38.798
--Dad said to stay here.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.542
What? To guard three iPads
and a Pandora bracelet?

12:41.630 --> 12:42.665
Have at it.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.677
It's very common
for someone to start a business

12:52.770 --> 12:54.385
because they have an affinity
for the product.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.469
You know what I'm saying?

12:55.560 --> 12:58.518
And that they not necessarily
have a very strong business model.

12:58.610 --> 13:02.182
-It happens all the time, so--
-I like titties so I opened a titty bar.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.645
That's exactly what I'm saying.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.605
Or gentlemen's club,
not sure what you call it around here.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.406
-But it‘s--
-I call it a titty bar.

13:07.490 --> 13:09.321
You think you can do better?

13:09.410 --> 13:12.948
Well, I think that any business
could benefit from a set of fresh eyes,

13:13.040 --> 13:16.919
and my research tells me
that you have the only, um...

13:17.000 --> 13:18.536
-Titty bar.
-...titty bar, sure,

13:18.630 --> 13:21.417
in the lake area, and yet you still...
you still seem to struggle,

13:21.500 --> 13:26.255
and I'm wondering
what you could do with an immediate loan

13:26.340 --> 13:28.046
and an updated business plan.

13:30.930 --> 13:33.216
I... I think that, uh,
a higher-caliber dancer

13:33.310 --> 13:37.098
would definitely translate
into a higher-paying customer.

13:37.190 --> 13:39.647
Is there any reason you can't have
beautiful women on your payroll?

13:39.730 --> 13:40.856
I don't think so.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.068
Beautiful girls won't work here.
I won't let 'em.

13:44.150 --> 13:48.189
Plain Janes with a work ethic?
That's my sweet spot nght there.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.770
Or freak bait.

13:50.870 --> 13:55.443
Angie here is working on number four.
See, I own the stage.

13:55.540 --> 13:58.828
They pay me to climb up on it,
plus 25% of their tips.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.959
No health insurance,
vacation time, 4015,

14:07.050 --> 14:10.178
social security, sick leave...
and no liability.

14:10.260 --> 14:13.673
-But I want my 25%. Read me?
-Uh-huh. Loud and clear.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.058
-Listen, this is--
-How much you got?

14:18.850 --> 14:22.684
-$100,000, uh, to start.
-You got more? 150, maybe 200?

14:23.570 --> 14:26.687
Yeah, sure I can.
Of course I can. Um, yeah.

14:26.780 --> 14:30.193
I'd need to, obviously, recoup 100%
of my investment as soon as possible,

14:30.280 --> 14:32.157
-and then I'd have two--
-Twenty-five percent.

14:33.410 --> 14:34.229
Sorry?

14:35.080 --> 14:36.195
My cut...

14:37.370 --> 14:38.655
for washing your money.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.069
What you're doing, ain't it?

14:42.790 --> 14:44.838
-I... I don't think you really--
-Hey!

14:46.050 --> 14:48.086
Don't you play me, Mr. Byrde.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.047
Got me a real big temper.

14:50.130 --> 14:52.132
You do not wanna see it get away from me.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.790
We're done here.

14:58.980 --> 14:59.969
All righty.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.309
All right. So... it was built in '75.

15:06.780 --> 15:11.808
You got... 2,500 square feet,

15:11.910 --> 15:16.404
not to mention 350 feet of lake frontage.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.361
You got two sea docks.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.912
- No way I can afford this.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.207
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Buddy.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.081
Actually, it's under your budget.

16:53.590 --> 16:55.922
Yeah, I'd, uh, invite you in, but...

16:56.840 --> 16:59.092
- my old man's in a mood right now.
- Huh.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.557
Wants me to study law
and work for him.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.131
Thinks journalism's a worthless degree.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.721
- Isn't it?
- Probably.

17:08.730 --> 17:10.470
- Everyone ready?
- Yeah.

17:22.910 --> 17:26.869
The great white shark's teeth
develop in many layered rows.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.168
While the shark may use only 50
at any given time,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.332
hundreds more of the shark's serrated--

17:54.150 --> 17:56.106
Basement's finished. I'll take that.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.908
You and yours can have the rest.

18:00.070 --> 18:04.279
I don't drive much but when I do,
I don't want to be hemmed in.

18:04.370 --> 18:06.702
So, wait...
You want to remain in the house?

18:06.790 --> 18:08.166
Sam...

18:08.250 --> 18:10.957
Sorry, Buddy. I didn't have time
to explain that to her. Um--

18:11.040 --> 18:13.998
- I've got a bad heart.
- Yeah.

18:15.340 --> 18:20.130
I need a new one._
But I'm 82, so I'm not getting one.

18:20.930 --> 18:24.593
My cardiologist tells me
that I've got a year...

18:25.390 --> 18:27.301
eighteen months, tops.

18:28.350 --> 18:31.899
He's a clot head, but other than that
I've no reason to doubt the man.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.891
Um... I'm sorry.

18:35.360 --> 18:39.478
I'm selling the place
under the condition

18:39.570 --> 18:43.119
that I be allowed to live here
until I die.

18:44.330 --> 18:48.073
I have a hot plate and a fridge
I can move downstairs.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.282
Any luck, we can go weeks
without seeing each other.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.206
Well, there it is.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.662
I understand it's an unusual condition,

18:58.760 --> 19:01.581
and I've priced the property
to reflect that.

19:05.180 --> 19:09.298
-How many kids do you have?
-Two. Girl and a boy.

19:10.140 --> 19:11.687
How old's the girl?

19:13.560 --> 19:14.561
Fifteen.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.390
Why?

19:16.900 --> 19:20.199
Oh, we're on a septic tank here,
not a sewer line.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.693
If she's gonna chuck her period plugs
down the crapper,

19:23.780 --> 19:26.863
you're gonna foot the Roto-Rooter bill
when the tank backs up.

19:26.950 --> 19:29.783
I beg your pardon. Period plugs?

19:32.040 --> 19:36.374
I have terminal heart disease, ma'am.
Since 2012.

19:36.460 --> 19:40.339
I believe in being direct.
That's not a problem, is it?

19:41.590 --> 19:42.466
No.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.716
No problem.

19:45.930 --> 19:48.717
Well, been very nice meeting you.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.552
If this isn't for you,
let's say our goodbyes, shall we?

19:54.650 --> 19:56.356
If it is, great.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.227
Let's call the decider to sign off.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.947
- Who?
- Your husband.

20:02.860 --> 20:05.772
_- Ah.
- We'll give you a call.

20:07.780 --> 20:09.077
Let me ask you something.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.530
Your heart...

20:13.290 --> 20:14.450
a year?

20:15.380 --> 20:16.836
Yeah, a year.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.377
Eighteen months.

20:46.570 --> 20:48.777
I'm sittin' down

20:49.740 --> 20:52.322
Sittin' down in my home

20:52.910 --> 20:55.162
Dear love of mine

20:56.120 --> 20:58.702
Please come here alone

20:59.380 --> 21:01.666
How many nights

21:02.210 --> 21:04.963
We were burning so

21:05.800 --> 21:07.756
Dear love of mine

21:08.300 --> 21:10.302
--Come on.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.056
What's going on?

21:14.100 --> 21:15.590
Here, put this on.

21:18.060 --> 21:19.721
This isn't your boat, is it?

21:20.650 --> 21:22.641
The house? College? Any of it?

21:23.610 --> 21:25.271
-Hey!
-Snug enough?

21:25.360 --> 21:28.238
For what? Wyatt, stop! What are you doing?

21:28.320 --> 21:30.618
And this love of mine

21:31.160 --> 21:33.867
She was on the phone

21:34.410 --> 21:37.914
You don't know why

21:38.000 --> 21:40.958
But you're like a stone

21:41.040 --> 21:43.417
Cold, different, changed

21:44.010 --> 21:46.467
Once she loved you so

21:47.050 --> 21:49.883
She will hate you now

21:50.430 --> 21:53.137
When it's time to go

21:56.640 --> 21:59.552
-Hi, I'm Jonah.
-I'm Tuck.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.889
Can I see the knife?

22:04.780 --> 22:07.817
Isn't it cool? You can have it.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.650
-You sure?
-P05|t|ve.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.151
-Thanks.
-My pleasure.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.072
$1,575 for a propeller.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.995
Stainless steel speed prop.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.547
Seems your daughter and her friends
parked a little too close to shore.

22:25.630 --> 22:26.870
They're not her friends.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.040
Yeah, and she didn't know
that this boat was stolen.

22:29.130 --> 22:32.293
She thought a teenager running
a leaf blower at a prom night motel

22:32.390 --> 22:35.598
lived in a $5 million home?
Drove a $90,000 boat?

22:36.180 --> 22:39.764
-Do you know who they are?
-Wyatt Langmore and his brother, Three.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.141
Now, joyriding's not usually their MO,

22:42.230 --> 22:45.529
but trust me when I tell you
they can't afford to pay.

22:45.610 --> 22:47.737
-And you're assuming we will?
-Mm-hmm.

22:47.820 --> 22:50.857
Charlotte painted a picture to my deputy
of a girl of some privilege.

22:50.950 --> 22:53.692
Private school education. Suburban home.

22:54.410 --> 22:57.243
I'm guessing that
your current choice in lodging

22:57.330 --> 23:00.709
is a reflection of frugality
rather than necessity.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.588
-A guessing game. That's fun. Can I try?
-Marty...

23:03.670 --> 23:05.706
-Please.
-Um, I'm thinking

23:05.800 --> 23:08.872
that arresting the white trash
that almost killed my daughter

23:08.970 --> 23:12.792
and extracting the truth is hard,
time-consuming work.

23:12.890 --> 23:17.054
Work which, if given a choice,
like us, you'd gladly forego.

23:17.140 --> 23:18.175
- Marty...

23:18.270 --> 23:22.764
So, uh, my guess is that this all comes
down to simple, run-of-the-mill laziness.

23:22.850 --> 23:24.260
-Shut up, Marty.
-How's that?

23:25.610 --> 23:26.850
What happened there?

23:34.410 --> 23:39.279
I have 1,150 miles of shoreline
to patrol and eight boats.

23:39.370 --> 23:42.032
I care about the taxpaying citizens
of this county,

23:42.120 --> 23:44.532
and the tourism dollar
upon which they depend.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.206
So...

23:48.550 --> 23:51.678
to those intent on leaving
a light economic footprint,

23:51.760 --> 23:55.469
staying in the cheapest possible places,
sucking the tit of this department,

23:55.550 --> 23:57.882
while criticizing me
in the prosecution of my duties,

23:57.970 --> 24:01.849
I say, "Go... to fucking Branson."

24:04.480 --> 24:05.469
That's great.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.687
Now, let's finish booking Charlotte,
shall we?

24:07.770 --> 24:10.682
Are you an appointed
or an elected official, Sheriff?

24:10.780 --> 24:12.065
Elected.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.119
And do the... the Langmores vote?

24:16.700 --> 24:18.861
Not historically. No, ma'am.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.941
I would think that votes
would be valuable around here.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.200
Do they pay taxes?

24:25.080 --> 24:26.206
We do.

24:27.380 --> 24:28.199
Both.

24:31.050 --> 24:31.960
And?

24:32.470 --> 24:34.756
-I put a deposit down on a home.
-We're looking for a home.

24:36.510 --> 24:37.750
Well...

24:39.180 --> 24:40.420
welcome.

24:41.350 --> 24:44.137
You're lucky that Charlotte didn't
get mixed up with Ruth Langmore.

24:45.060 --> 24:47.608
She's 19. Smart. Mean.

24:47.690 --> 24:50.898
As a criminal,
her potential's as yet untapped.

24:52.030 --> 24:56.273
Bill? Hey, uh, you wanna pick up
the, uh, brothers Langmore,

24:56.360 --> 24:58.066
Wyatt and Three?

24:58.160 --> 25:02.824
Yeah, they're living with their dad, Russ.
His trailer's in the cove. Right.

25:02.910 --> 25:06.414
-Sheriff, you have a picture of Ruth?
-Yeah.

25:12.590 --> 25:15.047
She is a B and E magician.

25:16.090 --> 25:19.548
Don't put down anything around her
that you're fond of.

25:27.650 --> 25:28.469
Hey.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.977
Why do I buy you a phone
if you don't answer it?

25:32.230 --> 25:33.140
It's charging.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.191
Who cleaned up in here?
Did you let somebody in?

25:41.280 --> 25:43.783
-No, I did it.
-You did?

25:44.290 --> 25:46.281
-Yes.
-Well, thank you. Sorry.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.496
Everything okay?

25:54.420 --> 25:55.546
Where'd you get this?

25:57.180 --> 25:58.545
A friend.

26:00.470 --> 26:02.506
I... I went for a short walk.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.142
I took the computers
and bracelet with me.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.576
Okay. Jonah, outside.

26:27.660 --> 26:30.379
Come on. Come, come on. Go, go. Please.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.497
-Jonah, come on. Come on, hurry.
-What?

26:48.310 --> 26:51.302
Yeah, no, you mentioned that,
but what about their cousin, Ruth?

26:51.400 --> 26:53.971
She lives with her uncles,
Russ and Boyd.

26:54.070 --> 26:58.063
They haven't seen Ruth and the boys
since this morning. Something missing?

26:59.320 --> 27:01.311
Uh, no. Uh-uh.

27:01.410 --> 27:03.526
Everything is fine, Sheriff. Thank you.

27:20.220 --> 27:22.290
Mom says that girl took something.

27:23.090 --> 27:25.342
That she's cousins
with those two assholes.

27:25.430 --> 27:27.762
Do I ask that much of you, Charlotte?

27:31.560 --> 27:33.096
I don't, do I?

27:37.190 --> 27:40.239
I know where they might have gone.
I just don't know how to get there.

27:42.410 --> 27:46.232
-Whatcha fishing for, son?
-I'm open to suggestions.

27:47.830 --> 27:48.819
Thank you.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.400
There you go.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.707
- Catﬁsh. Great.
- Yeah.

27:53.790 --> 27:55.746
-Thank you.
-You need some ice with that?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.489
Yes, ice, please.

27:59.090 --> 28:01.331
Twist right for fast, left for slow.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.257
If you get back after dark,
just tie it up good for me.

28:06.350 --> 28:09.171
-Yep, you got it. $100 bill. There you go.
-Thank you.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.635
Uh, excuse me, sir?

28:10.730 --> 28:15.224
Can I give you $100
for, uh, for those five catﬁsh?

28:15.310 --> 28:16.857
-Yeah.
-Not going fishing?

28:16.940 --> 28:18.180
Uh, I am going fishing. Sure.

28:18.270 --> 28:21.569
I'm just, uh... just getting off
to a good start, you know?

28:21.650 --> 28:22.639
Here we go.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.301
You wouldn't even _
have been able to get In

29:32.390 --> 29:34.221
if we hadn't got her out, Ruth.

29:34.310 --> 29:37.473
You didn't get the little dipshit
brother outta there, did you?

29:37.560 --> 29:41.109
No. You did not.
I had to wait for him to leave.

29:41.940 --> 29:46.525
I'd a been a sight more comfortable
with a couple grand and a Handycam.

29:46.610 --> 29:50.239
The point is, Uncle Boyd,
that much cash money's ill-gotten.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.616
We got as much right to it as he does.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.860
No, you do not.

29:53.950 --> 29:56.202
-That is my money and I'm taking it.
-The fuck you are!

29:56.290 --> 30:00.033
Relax! Rela_x.
Just tell me one thing, okay?

30:00.130 --> 30:03.338
What do you think you're gonna do
with all of that cash?

30:03.420 --> 30:06.127
Can't just stick it in that hole
behind a urinal

30:06.220 --> 30:07.869
in whatever the hell place this is, okay?

30:07.970 --> 30:09.585
And you can't put it in a bank.

30:09.680 --> 30:13.844
These guys file cash transaction reports
to the IRS for any deposits over $10,000.

30:13.930 --> 30:15.420
So forget about the bank.

30:15.520 --> 30:18.683
Can't go shopping for some fancy truck
or something. Not with cash.

30:18.770 --> 30:21.261
IRS'll be on your front doorstep
first thing in the morning.

30:21.360 --> 30:25.069
All that is there is a lifetime supply
of groceries and gas.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.390
That's all it is.

30:26.490 --> 30:27.889
-Fuckin' A.
-Shut up.

30:27.990 --> 30:28.979
That's mine.

30:29.070 --> 30:31.777
And, technically,
I'm only responsible for it.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.901
Whose money is it? Technically?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.901
His name is Omar Navarro.
Does that mean anything to you?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.127
-No. Who the fuck is a Omar Navarro?
-Well, it should.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.451
- He's a guy you need to worry about.
- Who is...

30:42.540 --> 30:44.201
-Omar Navarro.
-...Omar Navarro.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.416
- What do you mean, technically?
- Checking.

30:46.510 --> 30:50.253
Technically, it's not my money.
It's his and I'm... responsible for it.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.968
- Oh, fuck me.
- So you need to think this through.

30:58.810 --> 31:01.301
- You get it?
- No. No, I don't think so.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.517
Guy who runs a drug cartel's a smart man.

31:04.610 --> 31:07.602
He wouldn't trust damn near $3 million
to someone like you.

31:07.690 --> 31:08.896
Oh, he trusted me with eight.

31:08.990 --> 31:11.151
There's five more million under
the bed at that motel

31:11.240 --> 31:13.231
in a couple of duffel bags and a suitcase.

31:13.320 --> 31:16.904
You guys need to know how big
this mistake you're making is.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.322
You have $8 million
of some drug kingpin's money?

31:20.420 --> 31:21.876
-That's right.
-Why?

31:21.960 --> 31:23.279
Don't worry about that.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.871
The only question you guys
need to be asking is are you murderers?

31:25.960 --> 31:28.508
You steal that money,
you're gonna have to kill me.

31:28.590 --> 31:30.922
'Cause there's another man
who works for Mr. Navarro,

31:31.010 --> 31:33.467
a very serious man...
and he's gonna come to town.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.802
He's gonna ask me where that money is.
And if I'm still alive,

31:35.890 --> 31:38.461
I'm gonna have to tell him
that the Langmores stole it.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.893
At which point he's gonna
find someone with your last name

31:41.980 --> 31:45.188
and start removing their skin
until he locates the rest of you.

31:45.270 --> 31:49.104
So you decide, right now,
once and for all, are you killers?

31:51.820 --> 31:54.948
You know, a case could be made that...

31:55.490 --> 31:57.902
the disappearance of Mr. Byrde

31:57.990 --> 32:02.745
and the redistribution of this money...
constitutes a good thing.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.373
He's aiding and abetting
the sale of drugs.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.087
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, boy.

32:09.880 --> 32:14.965
Who knows how much pain and misery
he's caused?

32:15.260 --> 32:17.308
-Would cause.
-Would cause.

32:18.350 --> 32:19.669
To kids, even.

32:25.690 --> 32:26.805
Okay.

32:26.900 --> 32:32.896
No, we won't be buying new cars
and trucks off the lot. Fine.

32:32.990 --> 32:37.233
But Merle'd be happy to sell us
lightly used for cash, would he not?

32:37.330 --> 32:38.319
Oh, yeah.

32:39.910 --> 32:45.200
You think the IRS radar's up
the 70-inch Samsungs?

32:46.580 --> 32:47.535
I think not.

32:48.540 --> 32:53.375
We're never ever going to get
another opportunity like this.

32:54.800 --> 32:58.213
Who's the weak link here? Hmm?
Who's got the big mouth?

32:58.300 --> 33:02.339
Who's the weak link with the big mouth
and dates the trashy women

33:02.430 --> 33:06.309
and drinks too much
with the trashy men? Who is it?

33:06.400 --> 33:11.929
Who's the irresponsible one that's gonna
burn through theirs in, like, five years?

33:12.490 --> 33:14.139
They're gonna come asking you
for a little bit of yours

33:14.240 --> 33:16.731
and what are you gonna
tell that person? Hmm?

33:16.820 --> 33:19.732
You gonna tell them, "No"?
What happens then?

33:20.660 --> 33:24.903
Do they threaten to rat you out
for stealing the money and killing me?

33:25.000 --> 33:28.322
'Cause, don't forget,
for all this to work, you gotta kill me.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.333
And did you know that Missouri
has the death penalty?

33:33.840 --> 33:37.424
So... unless you're prepared
to kill a family member

33:37.510 --> 33:39.592
to keep yourself off death row,

33:39.680 --> 33:44.549
you're looking at constant, continuous,
relentless pursuit

33:44.640 --> 33:46.187
for the rest of your life.

33:46.980 --> 33:48.140
- Yeah. I'm out.
- Yeah.

33:48.230 --> 33:49.219
-Three.
-Oh, yeah.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.429
Good choice.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.318
- I'm sorry about Charlotte.
- Not good enough.

33:53.400 --> 33:57.484
-We're taking a hundred grand.
-Mr. Navarro will take it back.

33:57.570 --> 33:59.777
-Fifty, then.
-He'll take that, too.

34:01.580 --> 34:03.445
-Thirty.
-Nope.

34:03.540 --> 34:06.862
We're taking $20,000. Get 20...

34:07.830 --> 34:08.865
That's a mistake.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.167
...for our trouble
and dashed expectations.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.296
--Okeydoke.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.371
-Deal with it.
-You deal with it.

34:14.460 --> 34:18.089
Or you can tell Mr. Navarro the truth.

34:18.180 --> 34:20.887
You are a poor steward of his money.

34:20.970 --> 34:22.301
I'll let him know.

34:24.810 --> 34:25.720
Come on.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.440
Almost got that done, didn't I?

34:46.040 --> 34:50.158
Why do I have this feeling we both know
that you'd be better off dead?

35:56.110 --> 35:59.398
Route 78. Three miles south of I-80.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.486
Well?

36:49.950 --> 36:52.202
The jawbone was Hanson Sr.'s...

36:53.580 --> 36:57.038
but I guarantee you, if the rest
of that ooze could take shape...

36:58.170 --> 37:00.502
you'd find Bruce Liddell in there, too.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.500
And you're transferring to Missouri?

37:08.140 --> 37:10.802
That's where Martin Byrde is.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.682
Alive and well, swiping his Amex.

37:14.770 --> 37:16.306
How are we gonna do this?

37:22.070 --> 37:24.391
Byrde liquidates his business.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.810
Somebody does the same to Bruce.

37:30.620 --> 37:34.078
He jerks his family from Chicago
and $8 million from the bank,

37:34.160 --> 37:36.287
transporting both to southern Missouri.

37:38.710 --> 37:39.779
Why?

37:40.710 --> 37:43.087
That money was clean. Taxes were paid.

37:44.590 --> 37:47.673
If he was scared of us freezing it,
he'd just wire it into offshore oblivion.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.672
He needs that money.
For what, I do not know, but...

37:52.140 --> 37:53.550
it'll be illegal.

37:55.770 --> 37:57.397
And I'm gonna catch him.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.265
And when I do,
he'll tell me exactly how and where

38:00.360 --> 38:04.808
the cartels are laundering that money,
at which point I'll seize it. All of it.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.065
And then my career will be made.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.287
That's how I'm gonna do it.

38:15.330 --> 38:16.706
You and me.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.281
Have you thought about
how we're going to do this?

38:21.500 --> 38:22.706
We're not.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.151
Who loves his little girl?

39:49.880 --> 39:51.370
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

39:51.470 --> 39:52.755
Where you going?

40:00.770 --> 40:02.761
I just have to go somewhere.

40:05.110 --> 40:07.351
I want you to go back to sleep, okay?

40:13.490 --> 40:15.276
I'm sorry I left yesterday.

40:16.700 --> 40:17.906
I know.

40:19.790 --> 40:20.996
It's okay.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.660
I made a friend.

40:28.170 --> 40:29.626
His name is Tuck.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.502
And he works at the Blue Cat Lodge.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.632
Nobody stays in the lodge or...

40:39.680 --> 40:42.228
eats in the restaurant
or drinks at the bar.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.028
Go back to sleep, okay? I love you.

40:55.530 --> 40:56.986
I love you, too.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.791
You know, someday you're gonna
have a little boy.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.728
And I hope that you're as proud of him
as I am of you.

41:29.610 --> 41:30.725
Okay.

41:31.570 --> 41:32.855
Okay.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.406
Go to sleep.

41:52.170 --> 41:54.206
The insurance payout is a million dollars.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.836
-Okay?
-Marty, you got the money back.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.000
-You take the kids today...
-You... you won.

41:58.090 --> 41:59.421
-...and live off the credit card.
-You won.

41:59.510 --> 42:02.058
I didn't win. How did I win?

42:03.810 --> 42:05.675
I lost everything.

42:09.650 --> 42:10.969
We have nothing.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.142
If I'm dead, we have something.
It's simple.

42:15.240 --> 42:18.528
You take the kids today
and you live off the credit cards

42:18.610 --> 42:20.521
-until the insurance pays out.
-You're not thinking straight.

42:20.620 --> 42:22.406
Then you take that money
and you start over.

42:22.490 --> 42:23.616
You just need more time.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.533
No, I don't, Wendy.
This was a dodge. This was a lie.

42:26.620 --> 42:29.327
No one can wash $8 million down here.

42:29.420 --> 42:30.830
Not in three months.

42:31.750 --> 42:35.129
And when Del gets his $8 million back,
he'll be whole...

42:35.760 --> 42:38.331
and if he knows that I'm dead,
I don't think that he...

42:38.430 --> 42:40.466
I mean, he's got no reason to, uh...

42:42.050 --> 42:43.347
To what?

42:43.430 --> 42:45.591
He has...
He has no reason to kill... to kill us?

42:45.680 --> 42:48.057
Yeah, I don't think that he will.
Why would he?

42:48.850 --> 42:50.556
-You don't have to do this.
-I know.

42:50.650 --> 42:51.719
-Listen.
-You don't.

42:51.810 --> 42:54.142
_ -You don't have to--
-On this piece of paper is Del's e-mail.

42:54.230 --> 42:57.438
Ancl underneath it is an address
and the number of a storage unit.

42:57.530 --> 43:00.613
And that's where his money is.
That's where he'll find it.

43:00.700 --> 43:02.440
In three hours,
I want you to call the sheriff,

43:02.530 --> 43:05.863
and I want you to tell the sheriff
that I haven't come back

43:05.950 --> 43:07.702
-and that you're worried.
-Marty...

43:07.790 --> 43:11.703
I was hiking on Horseshoe Bend,
near Sweetwater Bluff.

43:11.790 --> 43:14.873
- Okay? Can you say that?

43:14.960 --> 43:17.167
-Say that. Say that to me. Come on.
-Horseshoe...

43:17.260 --> 43:20.127
- Horseshoe Bend. Near Sweetwater Bluff.
- Horseshoe Bend...

43:21.260 --> 43:24.388
I was hiking on Horseshoe Bend,
near Sweetwater Bluff.

43:24.470 --> 43:26.131
Sweetwater. . .

43:27.060 --> 43:28.300
Okay.

43:29.310 --> 43:30.766
That's where they're gonna ﬁnd me

43:30.850 --> 43:34.229
and then I want you to e-mail Del
and I want you to do it immediately, okay?

43:34.310 --> 43:36.392
Because if somebody else
finds that money,

43:36.480 --> 43:39.563
if somebody else goes
poking around that storage place...

43:39.650 --> 43:42.312
Marty. Marty, don't do this.

43:42.410 --> 43:44.059
Don't. Do not do this.

44:04.510 --> 44:05.590
Hello?

44:05.680 --> 44:08.137
Hey, Bob. Good morning. It's Marty Byrde.

44:08.220 --> 44:11.018
I've got a little bit
of a random question for you.

44:11.100 --> 44:16.686
Have you, by chance, ever handled
any life insurance investigations?

44:16.770 --> 44:18.852
A couple dozen. Why?

44:18.940 --> 44:21.898
Okay, good. 'Cause I've got this friend

44:21.990 --> 44:27.485
and he is looking for an answer,
or statistics, really,

44:27.580 --> 44:31.289
on how often carriers deny claims

44:31.370 --> 44:36.910
if there's any suspicion that
the poliw holder has committed suicide.

44:41.380 --> 44:45.749
Does this client have_ an actual claim
that's been denied or is he just curious?

44:45.840 --> 44:48.308
I think he just wants to know
how often the...

44:48.390 --> 44:51.427
the claim is paid out
after the investigation.

44:51.520 --> 44:56.219
Uh, yeah, how, how many times
they follow through with the payment.

44:56.310 --> 44:59.814
Uh, you know, I guess a percentage, maybe?

44:59.900 --> 45:03.392
I'm not sure. I mean, what can I tell him?
What do you think?

45:03.490 --> 45:07.563
Uh, 85% or... or 70%? Is it... Is it less?

45:07.660 --> 45:11.289
If it's an individual by himself,
any death, it's gonna be investigated.

45:11.370 --> 45:13.326
Sure, that's understandable.

45:13.410 --> 45:16.129
Um, but if it's an actual accident.

45:16.210 --> 45:18.622
If it's a car accident, if it's...

45:18.710 --> 45:20.587
I don't know,
I don't know what it would be.

45:20.670 --> 45:23.047
If it's hiking or if it's--

45:23.130 --> 45:25.758
It would depend. Now, this client...

45:25.840 --> 45:28.217
say he's maybe had
recent financial problems

45:28.300 --> 45:32.634
or demonstrated unusual behavior,
like quitting his job suddenly.

45:33.270 --> 45:38.936
Or... if maybe he had a spouse
who'd been unfaithful.

45:41.110 --> 45:44.273
_ That's all ammunition
the insurance company would use

45:44.360 --> 45:46.271
to try and not pay out.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.112
Yeah, yeah, so...

45:48.200 --> 45:50.612
would you put it at, like, 50%?

45:59.790 --> 46:01.951
Bob? Is it less than 50?

46:03.670 --> 46:05.626
I can't give you numbers.

46:10.390 --> 46:11.379
Mr. Byrde?

46:14.430 --> 46:16.136
Thanks so much for your help.

46:50.760 --> 46:53.467
Yes, yes, I know. I...

46:53.560 --> 46:56.097
I'm sure I'm worrying over nothing.
It's just he...

46:56.180 --> 46:57.670
He doesn't know the roads here.

46:59.310 --> 47:01.187
Exactly. That's all I ask.

47:03.020 --> 47:05.432
All right. Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.737
--Hey, Dad.

47:15.830 --> 47:17.570
- Where's your mom?

47:25.460 --> 47:26.700
Did you send the e-mail?

47:30.130 --> 47:30.960
Good.

47:33.930 --> 47:35.136
Good.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.010
I wasn't thinking straight.

48:01.670 --> 48:02.568
Hey, pal.

48:04.290 --> 48:06.292
Tell me more about the Blue Cat Lodge.

48:23.650 --> 48:26.562
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

48:27.480 --> 48:29.937
Go on. Get up. I got shit to do. Come on.

48:30.030 --> 48:31.566
Up, up. Come on.

48:31.650 --> 48:34.357
Miss Garrison,
I don't know anything about your business.

48:34.450 --> 48:39.149
Therefore I have no suggestions
on how to improve it.

48:39.240 --> 48:42.494
I invest in people, not businesses.

48:42.580 --> 48:45.492
I look for people that are passionate
about what they do,

48:45.580 --> 48:48.959
and for some reason,
they haven't found success.

48:49.050 --> 48:52.463
And I know money.
I know how to make it work.

48:53.590 --> 48:55.046
I know how to get it.

48:55.760 --> 49:01.096
I have it... _ _
and I'm willing to invest it in you.

49:04.890 --> 49:09.509
Look, uh, Marty, I know this angle.

49:10.150 --> 49:12.687
You invest. Hmm?

49:13.360 --> 49:15.658
And then we go and we remodel some units.

49:17.530 --> 49:20.283
And come June,
business improves incrementally...

49:21.080 --> 49:22.741
and I take a little more money.

49:22.830 --> 49:25.037
And then July rolls around,
a little more money,

49:25.120 --> 49:27.327
but it's advertising for the Fourth.

49:27.420 --> 49:30.048
And then a few more units are rented...

49:31.170 --> 49:34.378
and it's better than nothing,
but it's still not enough

49:34.470 --> 49:37.382
to service the debt on the loan
I already owe the bank.

49:37.470 --> 49:40.382
A loan secured by the mortgage
on this property.

49:41.850 --> 49:43.090
That old chestnut.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.557
And then, before you know it,
it's Labor Day

49:48.650 --> 49:51.471
and I'm in hock to you and the bank

49:51.570 --> 49:55.279
and you force a sale,
recoup your investment with interest.

49:55.360 --> 49:59.273
I don't need you for that, Marty,
'cause I can fuck things up all by myself.

49:59.990 --> 50:00.979
So get out.

50:02.160 --> 50:03.195
Now.

50:18.260 --> 50:23.004
Shit, I don't know.
I do know that he has a kitty named Henry.

50:23.100 --> 50:27.969
Tuck, you are, without a doubt,
the biggest retard I've ever seen.

50:31.860 --> 50:32.929
Hey.

50:34.070 --> 50:36.561
Don't use that word.
What the hell's the matter with you?

50:36.650 --> 50:39.813
-Did you say something to me?
-You can't use that word. Ever.

50:41.660 --> 50:43.537
You telling me what I can and can't say?

50:43.620 --> 50:46.077
Yeah. I give that lesson to my kids,
they get it right away.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.821
You got about 20 years on both of them

50:47.910 --> 50:49.571
and you still don't know
you can't say that shit?

51:01.850 --> 51:05.923
I mean, why does he have to feel bad
just so you can feel good?

51:06.020 --> 51:10.343
Plus, when you disrespect him,
you disrespect this whole place.

51:10.440 --> 51:12.305
And you might be able to get away
with that kind of crap

51:12.400 --> 51:15.688
at the dive bars you're used to going to,
but not here.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.309
I won't tolerate it.

51:18.150 --> 51:21.062
- You won't tolerate it?
- That's right.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.909
I won't... tolerate it.

51:40.510 --> 51:41.920
Now hang on a second.

51:42.010 --> 51:44.808
You take a big deep breath,
'cause I want you to look at something.

51:46.390 --> 51:49.302
That wall's got about
50 years' worth of photographs.

51:49.390 --> 51:51.472
One specifically, this one right here,

51:51.560 --> 51:53.437
with the kid and his dad
and that great big fish.

51:53.520 --> 51:54.976
Bartender, can I see that picture there

51:55.060 --> 51:56.937
with the kid and his dad
and that big fish?

51:57.030 --> 51:58.429
That's it. Thank you.

51:59.530 --> 52:02.602
Now, this is an illusion.
Whoever took this photo

52:02.700 --> 52:06.943
told this kid to push this fish forward
so it'd look bigger in the picture

52:07.040 --> 52:10.953
because he wanted to make this memory
as special as possible, because he cared.

52:11.580 --> 52:12.740
That happens here.

52:13.380 --> 52:16.588
And you want to disrespect that?
I don't think so.

52:17.170 --> 52:22.176
Now I want you to apologize
to that young man right now.

52:24.180 --> 52:27.388
You miserable, redneck...

52:29.520 --> 52:30.839
cocksucker.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.587
Who is that?

52:59.380 --> 53:00.790
That is Buddy Dieker.

53:01.550 --> 53:02.539
Who?

53:03.430 --> 53:09.255
Mr. Dieker will be living in the basement
for a year... give or take.

53:10.970 --> 53:12.551
Mom, what are we doing here?

53:19.860 --> 53:22.738
Your father's laundering money
for a Mexican drug cartel.

53:25.780 --> 53:27.156
I shit you not.

53:29.620 --> 53:30.860
Hello, Mr. Dieker!
