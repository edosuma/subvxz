00:55.122 --> 00:57.024
Well, that's remarkable.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.325
What's the ruckus, gentlemen?

Murdoch.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.729
I might have known.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.698
It's called a kinetoscope, sir.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.400
And I suppose it
can detect guilt.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.736
Or differentiate between strands
of hair and whatnot, can it?

01:09.736 --> 01:11.238
No.
No.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.739
But the interesting thing
about hair follicles

01:12.739 --> 01:14.608
is, they're actually
receptacles for--

10:55.522 --> 10:58.191
Concentrate, George.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.627
Let's write the obvious ones.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.195
N, and O--

11:05.231 --> 11:11.137
"Sick," "Cauldron," "Orange."

11:11.137 --> 11:12.505
No.
-Close.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.339
Close.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.408
I'll need you to get me
some newspapers, George.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.250
May 11, 1892.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.084
Right.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.420
Now we know when.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.689
All we need is the who.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.125
And the why as well, I guess.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.261
Like, why was he interested
in a children's hospital?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.033
Maybe he wasn't.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.509
Oh--

11:49.509 --> 11:51.344
Alas, poor Yorrick.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.378
I knew him, Horatio.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.084
A little morgue humor.

11:58.084 --> 11:59.085
Eh, yes.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.554
Very funny.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.388
Here.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.190
Put some balm on your upper lip.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.124
It'll help mask the stench.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.297
And what has Yorrick
to say for himself?

12:11.297 --> 12:12.632
Quite a bit, actually.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.968
There's evidence of arthritis.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.469
Age, approximately 40 years.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.637
Did you happen
to notice anything

12:17.637 --> 12:19.973
unusual in the upper torso?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.207
Very good, William.

12:21.207 --> 12:24.277
There's a nick on
one of the ribs.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.678
Any idea of the weapon?

12:25.678 --> 12:27.080
A dagger, perhaps?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.082
Mm, possibly something
with a duller edge.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.117
Whatever it was, it likely
slipped past the rib cage

12:31.117 --> 12:33.152
and penetrated the heart.

12:33.152 --> 12:36.322
And did you find anything
that might help identify him?

12:36.322 --> 12:38.424
I believe so.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.492
Dentures.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.360
Ivory.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.330
It's fine workmanship, too.

12:44.330 --> 12:50.570
Unh-- ah-- ah--
unh, unh, oh, oh,

12:50.570 --> 12:54.507
ah, ah, hunh-- unh-- ah, ah--

12:54.507 --> 12:57.043
MURDOCH: Dr. Murphey--
Dr. Murphey--

12:57.043 --> 12:58.444
Detective William Murdoch.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.612
I need to ask you
some questions.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.514
PATIENT: Unh, unh, unh--

13:08.721 --> 13:10.690
We'll have to make
it quick, Detective.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.493
Leave them alone too
long, and they run.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.395
I understand the impulse.

13:15.395 --> 13:19.365
Would you happen
to recognize these?

13:19.365 --> 13:20.266
Of course.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.734
An artist never
forgets his work.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.339
Now, remember, Murdoch.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.173
This woman is a--

13:27.173 --> 13:29.342
Sensitive, sir?

13:29.342 --> 13:32.178
Just let me handle things.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.213
Have you any news
about last night?

13:34.213 --> 13:36.416
As a matter of fact, yes.

13:36.416 --> 13:40.620
We believe the victim died on
or around May the 11th, 1892.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.689
Do you remember anything
about that period?

13:42.689 --> 13:44.057
Oh.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.558
1892.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.994
We were-- we were doing
the Scottish play,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.696
and I was playing the lead.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.464
The reviews were excellent.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.534
Oh, you are too kind.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.436
I would have thought
something more important

13:56.436 --> 13:58.438
might have come to mind.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.372
No.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.741
Mrs. Smart-- that was
the date of the passing

14:01.741 --> 14:03.443
of your first husband.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.578
Oh, my God.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.479
Oh, my God, you're right.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.314
Virgil.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.216
Oh, I-- I must have put
it right out of my mind.

14:10.216 --> 14:14.153
But-- but what has Virgil
to do with anything?

14:14.153 --> 14:18.558
Because the body that
fell onto the stage was--

14:18.558 --> 14:21.494
Virgil?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.062
Oh.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.030
ARTHUR: Stella?

14:24.030 --> 14:27.367
Stella-- are you all right?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.701
[BOOM]

14:29.702 --> 14:32.238
But that thing can't--
can't be Virgil.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.306
I was at his funeral.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.374
I saw him buried.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.208
Sh.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.042
Sh.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.677
And you never looked
directly at the body?

14:37.677 --> 14:38.511
No.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.146
No, actually never.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.247
Not even at the wake?

14:41.247 --> 14:43.583
No, I-- I couldn't
bear to look at him,

14:43.583 --> 14:46.319
so I requested a closed casket.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.422
Sh-- sh, sh.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.723
Mrs. Smart, do
you have any idea

14:50.723 --> 14:55.194
why someone might have wanted
to harm your former husband?

14:55.194 --> 14:56.562
No, none.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.599
We found a scrap of
newspaper in his clothing.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.001
On it was an article
about the building

15:02.001 --> 15:03.436
boom in Toronto's downtown.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.072
Increased construction,
increased property value--

15:06.072 --> 15:07.540
I fail to see the significance.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.308
Your theater is in that area.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.476
So?

15:10.476 --> 15:13.079
So the theater's value would
have been extremely high.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.180
What are you suggesting?

15:14.180 --> 15:17.650
Perhaps your former
husband was trying to sell.

15:17.650 --> 15:23.623
Well, it might explain
some things, Stella.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.224
What sort of things?

15:25.224 --> 15:28.694
Well, there were some
shady sorts coming

15:28.694 --> 15:31.130
and going, looking for Virgil.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.733
Could they have been
interested in the theater?

15:33.733 --> 15:36.202
Well, it's not something
we're proud to admit.

15:36.202 --> 15:40.239
But the theater was in some
financial difficulty back then.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.541
There are some
people who prefer

15:41.541 --> 15:43.576
to watch vulgar
variety acts, rather

15:43.576 --> 15:47.246
than experiencing true theater.

15:47.246 --> 15:51.050
Perhaps someone knew of
our financial situation,

15:51.050 --> 15:54.520
and they hired these thugs,
to force Virgil to sell.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.354
Oh, God.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.089
Poor Virgil.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.459
We'll look into this,
won't we, Detective?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.393
Yes, sir.

16:00.393 --> 16:05.431
Inspector-- if that
was Virgil's body

16:05.431 --> 16:09.569
that fell from the rafters,
then whom did I bury?

16:15.241 --> 16:16.576
[BOOM]

16:21.447 --> 16:24.617
It's so difficult to find
a good skeleton these days.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.652
Now, I have two.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.587
Strange.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.322
Isn't it?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.490
Oh, I mean the case.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.357
Oh.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.325
How so?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.027
The motive is unclear to me.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.496
-Unclear?
-Yes.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.397
Apparently there were
some questionable sorts

16:38.397 --> 16:41.367
trying to intimidate Virgil
Smart into selling the theater.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.135
You don't think
that was the case?

16:43.135 --> 16:45.738
Why hide the body
in the theater?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.707
There are much better
places to hide a body.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.541
Exactly.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.409
And what's even
more troubling is,

16:50.409 --> 16:52.645
even if they did
murder Virgil Smart,

16:52.645 --> 16:55.414
they didn't end up
with the theater.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.083
But his wife did.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.552
Yes, she did, didn't she?

16:59.552 --> 17:01.153
[BOOM]

17:07.560 --> 17:11.163
It was a male-- mid
40s, I'd estimate.

17:11.163 --> 17:14.300
It's curious how
similar the victims are.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.503
Note the pelvic girdle--
almost identical in length.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.139
Likewise, the femur and tibia.

17:20.139 --> 17:22.275
Roughly the same in
height and stature.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.377
It's not just that.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.246
Mr. Smart had a-- an
elongated frontal lobe.

17:27.246 --> 17:28.648
It's very unusual.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.182
Now, take a look at
our unknown friend.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.220
Very similar.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.024
The two must have borne more
than a passing resemblance.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.292
Coincidence?

17:39.292 --> 17:41.360
Possibly.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.030
Any identifiable features?

17:44.030 --> 17:45.464
I couldn't get
much from the teeth.

17:45.464 --> 17:46.766
I might find more later.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.068
Whoever he is,
his identity could

17:49.068 --> 17:50.670
hold the key to this case.

17:50.670 --> 17:56.075
I imagine you'll have a devil
of a time finding a name.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.410
[WHOOSH]

18:01.213 --> 18:04.183
A body with characteristics
very similar to Virgil Smart's.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.053
Yes, yes, I'm not
stupid, Murdoch.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.521
There's also a company
of actors who may

18:08.521 --> 18:10.456
know who this second victim is.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.258
Does that mean you're
coming round, then?

18:12.258 --> 18:13.225
Not entirely.

18:13.225 --> 18:17.229
But I will concede that they're
our only link to the murderer.

18:17.229 --> 18:20.533
I'll bring them
in for questioning.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.367
Mrs. Smart.

18:24.737 --> 18:29.108
Please tell me what happened
the day that Virgil died.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.010
Oh, must I?

18:31.010 --> 18:32.645
I'm afraid so.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.747
Would you care to
take a seat, ma'am?

18:34.747 --> 18:37.683
Thank you.

18:37.683 --> 18:41.187
We were rehearsing
for the Scottish play.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.323
We were rehearsing
for the Scottish play.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.628
Having never worked
harder in our lives.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.030
Soon, all performances
were booked.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.399
Uh-- no doubt, due
largely to yourself.

18:53.399 --> 18:57.370
Oh, do stop.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.338
He said he had never
seen such a success.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.173
Oh, how we celebrated.

19:01.173 --> 19:02.475
We celebrated.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.010
Oh, how we celebrated.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.979
Oh, how we celebrated.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.716
As usual, Virgil locked
himself in his office to go

19:10.716 --> 19:12.418
over the evening's receipts.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.286
Normally he'd join
us after a spell.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.422
But this time, he
failed to do so.

19:16.422 --> 19:20.059
So of course Stella sent
Ellen to seek him out.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.727
You understand, I adore Stella.

19:21.727 --> 19:25.464
But that woman can
do nothing herself.

19:25.464 --> 19:28.534
So I sent Ellen
to seek him out.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.537
She knocked at his door.

19:31.537 --> 19:32.371
[STOMPS]

19:32.371 --> 19:33.673
[POUNDS]

19:37.243 --> 19:38.411
There was no answer.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.980
We became worried, and
our evening of splendor

19:40.980 --> 19:42.481
turned to one of distress.
What if he was ill?

19:42.481 --> 19:43.382
What if he had collapsed?

19:43.382 --> 19:45.117
We needed to get inside.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.587
Luckily, there was a
constable just outside.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.523
This constable.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.724
Do you recall his name?

19:51.724 --> 19:52.992
Constable Morrison.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.393
He called himself Morrison.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.095
Morrison, I believe.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.497
The door broke in with a crash.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.366
There was Virgil.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.435
Slumped over his desk.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.004
Face down.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.239
Not moving one muscle.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.108
Ellen ran for the
nearest doctor, of course.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.609
And the doctor-- do
you recall his name?

20:10.609 --> 20:11.444
Yes.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.579
As a matter of
fact, Dr. Watkins.

20:13.579 --> 20:14.447
It was Watkins.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.281
Watkins.

20:15.281 --> 20:18.117
Dr. Watkins.

20:18.117 --> 20:22.054
The news Watkins
delivered was tragic.

20:25.558 --> 20:30.730
Virgil had died of
a heart failure.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.498
We were all
devastated, of course.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.568
But we had to stay
strong-- for Stella.

20:38.537 --> 20:44.977
I-- I couldn't bear to look
at Virgil, my beloved husband.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.113
I know this is extremely
painful, Mrs. Smart.

20:47.113 --> 20:51.550
But we must do this,
for-- for Virgil's sake.

20:51.550 --> 20:55.254
There's only so much
a woman can bear.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.156
You loved him, didn't you?

20:57.156 --> 21:00.392
As Juliet would
say, "Our love was as

21:00.392 --> 21:03.562
deep and boundless as the sea."

21:03.562 --> 21:04.430
Oh--

21:09.135 --> 21:11.604
Every question, every detail.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.741
Everything clear,
organized, and precise.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.343
They remember the
name of the constable

21:17.343 --> 21:18.577
that came to their aid.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.513
Even the doctor that
determined the cause of death.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.047
Everything.

21:22.047 --> 21:24.416
Stress has a way
of fusing memories.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.520
I remember when I was a wee boy,
I broke my leg playing rugby.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.322
I still remember every
detail of that doctor's room.

21:30.322 --> 21:33.292
Even the way he smelled,
of tobacco, and peppermint.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.127
One person, I could understand.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.295
But four people?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.998
Each with identical memories?

21:38.998 --> 21:40.633
It's almost as if they were--

21:40.633 --> 21:42.468
Rehearsed.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.370
Precisely.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.738
[MUSIC PLAYING]

22:29.114 --> 22:33.252
Fillet of a fenny snake, in
the cauldron boil and bake.

22:33.252 --> 22:36.689
Sounds like one of
my mother's recipes.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.990
George.

22:37.990 --> 22:38.624
Sir?

22:38.624 --> 22:40.492
I need you to find
a Constable Morrison.

22:40.492 --> 22:41.527
-Morrison.
-Yes.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.262
He attended the death
of Virgil Smart.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.997
Find him and bring him
around to the Grand Theater

22:44.997 --> 22:45.698
this afternoon.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.399
Consider it done.

22:47.399 --> 22:51.203
Uh, sir-- Shakespeare.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.039
He's really just writing about
the human heart, isn't he, sir?

22:54.039 --> 22:54.673
Well observed.

22:57.509 --> 22:59.745
"A kind heart he hath.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.147
A woman would run
through fire and water

23:02.147 --> 23:05.284
for such a kind heart."

23:05.284 --> 23:06.518
"The Merry Wives of Windsor."

23:06.518 --> 23:08.754
Ah-- I'm impressed.

23:08.754 --> 23:09.688
You're the first.

23:09.688 --> 23:13.092
The Jesuits thought I was far
too analytical for literature.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.226
Nonsense.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.728
I heard you're looking
for Dr. Watkins.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.562
I am.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.396
Do you know him?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.264
I'm afraid he's dead.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.633
But his reputation lives on.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.401
His reputation?

23:22.401 --> 23:25.204
Dr. Watkins had a
knack for misdiagnosis.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.673
It was he who determined Virgil
Smart died of heart failure

23:27.673 --> 23:29.174
at his desk.

23:29.174 --> 23:32.711
Well, even he could not have
mistaken heart attack for death

23:32.711 --> 23:34.079
by knife.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.148
Unless it wasn't Mr.
Smart at the desk.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.383
Our other unknown body.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.217
Exactly.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.718
That would fit
with my findings.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.654
His hyoid bone was crushed.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.122
The unknown victim
was strangled.

23:43.122 --> 23:43.756
Yes.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.591
And Doctor Watkins
could have mistaken

23:45.591 --> 23:46.425
that for a heart attack.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.527
So if, as you suspect,
the two bodies

23:48.527 --> 23:50.296
were somehow switched, then--

23:50.296 --> 23:53.198
All the more reason we
need to find his identity.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.968
I think I have a way.

23:55.968 --> 24:01.707
Oh, and, um-- let's
see, somewhere-- aha.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.312
Clay?

24:06.312 --> 24:08.113
Is this really the time
for arts and crafts?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.114
Heh-- No.

24:09.114 --> 24:09.982
His.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.684
His what?

24:11.684 --> 24:13.152
Wilhelm His.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.054
The German anatomist
who recreated

24:15.054 --> 24:17.656
Bach's face by determining
the average tissue

24:17.656 --> 24:19.191
depth over each bone.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.626
I thought you
could use this to--

24:20.626 --> 24:22.661
Recreate our poor man's face.

24:22.661 --> 24:23.562
Hm.

24:23.562 --> 24:24.396
It's brilliant.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.305
[BOOM]

24:33.305 --> 24:34.707
[MUSIC PLAYING]

24:43.248 --> 24:46.618
Well, I broke in the door,
and he was lying on his desk,

24:46.618 --> 24:47.619
just over there.

24:47.619 --> 24:49.621
And you're quite sure the door
was locked from the inside.

24:49.621 --> 24:50.456
I'm positive.

24:50.456 --> 24:53.025
The-- see, the key
was found on the desk.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.394
The bolt was shot home.

24:55.394 --> 24:56.562
Did you examine the body?

24:56.562 --> 24:57.396
No.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.365
No, a, a doctor was
called for straight away.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.141
Three floors up.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.309
No fire escape.

25:12.711 --> 25:15.614
What are you looking for, sir?

25:15.614 --> 25:17.082
The victim was strangled.

25:17.082 --> 25:19.318
I very much doubt he
did it to himself.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.153
But there was no one in here.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.690
And you can see for yourself,
there's no place to hide.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.557
[MUSIC PLAYING]

25:56.088 --> 25:57.356
Oh, but I think there is.

26:09.368 --> 26:12.704
Um, sir.

26:12.704 --> 26:13.539
If I may.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.743
[CLICK]

26:23.282 --> 26:24.149
Well done, George.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.758
What do we have here?

26:32.758 --> 26:33.992
A love nest?

26:40.399 --> 26:44.436
Lead us not into
temptation, George?

26:44.436 --> 26:45.337
Yes, sir.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.743
CONSTABLE MORRISON: There is
some broken glass here, sir.

26:51.743 --> 26:54.012
That looks to be a
wine glass, Detective.

27:00.552 --> 27:01.386
Sir?

27:05.390 --> 27:07.993
Blood stain, I believe.

27:07.993 --> 27:09.094
Gentlemen?

27:09.094 --> 27:14.433
I believe what we have found
here is the real murder scene.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.001
[WHOOSH]

27:16.001 --> 27:17.369
INSPECTOR BRACKENREID:
So this old theater's

27:17.369 --> 27:19.638
finally giving up
its secrets, is it?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.206
And that of Virgil.

27:21.206 --> 27:24.343
I believe he used
this room for trysts.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.345
Stabbed here.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.313
We found finger
marks on three wine

27:28.313 --> 27:31.283
glasses-- two on the table,
and one thrown against the wall

27:31.283 --> 27:33.218
here.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.286
Lovers' quarrel.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.255
Jealous husband.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.023
We also found a letter
opener that appears

27:38.023 --> 27:39.491
to have been wiped clean.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.226
Likely of blood
and finger marks.

27:41.226 --> 27:42.060
[SIGH]

27:42.060 --> 27:44.029
It's disappointing.

27:44.029 --> 27:45.464
Sir, it could
lead to an arrest.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.598
No, no, no, no, no.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.666
I mean this world.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.468
This theater.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.036
There are other theaters.

27:51.036 --> 27:53.472
Not like this theater.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.542
A real stage, that
gives voice to the Bard.

27:56.542 --> 28:01.046
Nowadays, it's all singing
pirates and bloody hypnotists.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.048
Every art has an evolution.

28:03.048 --> 28:03.982
Evolution?

28:03.982 --> 28:06.418
To stand on a stage
and recite his words

28:06.418 --> 28:08.987
is nothing less than
a privilege, Murdoch.

28:08.987 --> 28:11.990
One I trust you've had.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.458
I did take to the stage.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.293
Just the once.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.395
Amateur theater.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.764
I was terrified the entire time.

28:18.764 --> 28:21.767
When the final curtain
fell, I wanted to do

28:21.767 --> 28:25.337
the whole thing all over again.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.105
What part did you play?

28:27.105 --> 28:28.140
Second clown.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.075
Hamlet.

28:30.075 --> 28:32.277
One of my favorites, sir.

28:32.277 --> 28:34.213
Did you think to pursue it?

28:34.213 --> 28:36.114
Once upon a time, maybe.

28:36.114 --> 28:39.117
Then I joined the regiment,
met the wife, had the bairns.

28:39.117 --> 28:40.519
The bairns?

28:40.519 --> 28:42.054
Children.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.189
No regrets.

28:44.189 --> 28:48.527
If we close down this theater,
I'm helping put another nail

28:48.527 --> 28:51.396
in the Bard's coffin.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.600
The man has been around
for 300 years, Inspector.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.035
Something tells me he's
not going anywhere.

28:57.035 --> 28:58.070
Mm.

28:58.070 --> 28:58.704

29:25.063 --> 29:28.033
I wondered where the old
dog was doing his mischief.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.568
Then I suppose it
wasn't his wife he

29:29.568 --> 29:31.203
was entertaining in that room.

[LAUGHS]

29:33.171 --> 29:35.007
Good gracious, no.

29:35.007 --> 29:38.176
So you knew Virgil
was seeing other women?

29:38.176 --> 29:39.044
Mm.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.045
Suspected.

29:40.045 --> 29:43.215
Any idea who these
conquests might have been?

29:43.215 --> 29:44.750
Oh, any woman who
set foot on that stage

29:44.750 --> 29:47.419
was fair game, as
far as I could tell.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.253
Miss Granger?

29:48.253 --> 29:50.722
Ellen-- not that I know of.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.424
But anything's possible.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.762
Sorry.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.130
I haven't been much help.

Actually, you've
been a great help.

Thank you.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.967
Well, I don't see how.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.168
But thank you for
the tea, Detective.

30:11.743 --> 30:12.744
No.

Thank you.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.514
[MUSIC PLAYING]

30:21.053 --> 30:23.322
So you had no knowledge
of this secret room?

30:23.322 --> 30:24.389
None, whatsoever.

30:24.389 --> 30:26.458
Did Miss Granger?

30:26.458 --> 30:30.262
If you are implying what I
think you are, I must warn you.

I will defend my
fiancee's honor.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.766
Ah, no offense
was meant, really.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.134
I'm merely trying
to establish who

30:36.134 --> 30:37.302
might have been in that room.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.370
Dozens of women, I'm sure.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.271
But not Ellen.

Of course.

been one of them?

one in particular, sir.

ever entice you into his room?

How could you
suggest such a thing?

every woman he knew there.

have a hidden room.

suggestive decor.

in the room at some point.

enough to throw a wine glass.

Did he have a family?

Did they miss him?

And why did this
man have to die?

brains out, had I so

you tonight, Stella?

Whatever do you mean, my dear?

34:09.748 --> 34:12.450
She means you missed two cues.

34:12.450 --> 34:14.686
I think we need someone
else to play the messenger.

What were you
doing in the wings?

34:24.696 --> 34:26.998
Has there been some
development in the case?

Yes.

Yes.

help me identify someone.

So you do recognize him?

34:43.648 --> 34:45.016
It's Eddie.

Yes, it's Eddie.

Green.

34:50.555 --> 34:54.125
Well, I'll admit, I'm relieved
that you do recognize him.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.061
Why is that, Detective?

34:56.061 --> 34:59.998
Because Eddie was buried
in Virgil Smart's grave.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.672
STELLA: Eddie Green.

35:07.672 --> 35:10.041
He had a small part in Othello.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.010
Eddie only had small parts.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.712
He was utterly
lacking in talent.

35:13.712 --> 35:17.082
I don't know why Virgil kept
him around as long as he did.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.216
As long as he did?

35:18.216 --> 35:20.085
Well, a few days
before Virgil died,

35:20.085 --> 35:22.187
he cut Eddie from the cast.

35:22.187 --> 35:25.590
He seemed quite upset
about being fired.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.559
And when Mr. Green
disappeared, no one thought

35:27.559 --> 35:28.994
to inquire where he'd gone?

assumed he'd gone to seek

35:49.447 --> 35:50.749
about Eddie Green's death.

What evidence do we have?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.385
Finger marks.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.386
But that only proves that--

35:54.386 --> 35:56.154
That they were in the
room at some point.

But they did lie
about being there.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.559
Something to do with
the sale of the theater.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.428
That's circumstantial at best.

36:03.428 --> 36:04.429

They're a troupe,
putting on a performance.

So?

What would happen
if their lines

36:11.536 --> 36:14.305
were all suddenly rewritten?

36:14.305 --> 36:15.306
They'd have to improvise.

36:15.306 --> 36:16.141
Yes.

36:16.141 --> 36:19.277
And perhaps, when
unscripted, it might

all tell a different story.

This is most peculiar.

you want us in costume?

the meaning of this?

36:42.333 --> 36:45.003
I fail to see how dressing
in costume can help.

I must agree.

you everything we know.

to do, with your help,

is recreate key moments
leading up to the discovery

36:55.246 --> 36:56.147

overlooking something.

And I hope that, by
restaging these events,

become apparent to me.

this is highly unusual.

Oh, oh-- well, all right.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.537
Good.

37:19.537 --> 37:23.641
So you were performing
the Scottish play,

37:26.511 --> 37:28.413
We all were.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.647
Of course.

37:29.647 --> 37:34.185
So the curtain came down, but
Virgil failed to join you.

37:34.185 --> 37:38.456
So you sent Ellen
to seek him out.

Well, yes.

to that effect.

Correct.

MURDOCH: What were you thinking?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.758
What were you feeling?

38:13.758 --> 38:18.496
Well, I, uh, feared for Virgil.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.265
Of course, of course.

38:20.265 --> 38:22.033
And Mr. Wellesley,
where were you?

38:22.033 --> 38:23.134
Backstage.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.169
Right.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.337
So what did you do
next, Mr. Martin?

38:26.337 --> 38:28.973
I ran for the police officer,
to help break down the door.

38:28.973 --> 38:29.641

Virgil's life, you

help of any stage hands,

rather chance finding

lets himself be natural,

39:46.451 --> 39:48.386
We took the liberty of
dressing him like Virgil,

39:48.386 --> 39:52.457
applied a little makeup
and a mustache-- George.

39:52.457 --> 39:53.591
Uncanny.

39:53.591 --> 39:57.595
At first glance, even he
could pass for Virgil.

you found the body?

40:00.164 --> 40:01.132

40:01.132 --> 40:02.000
Thank you very much.

of this exercise.

Other than upsetting my wife.

Actually, I find it
quite illuminating.

No one rushed to Virgil's aid.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.413
I was in shock.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.750
Besides, it was clear--
he was dead, really.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.286
Because I couldn't
have been certain.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.087
Not by merely looking at him.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.656
That's why we sent
for the doctor.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.724
And he told he died
of a heart attack.

40:26.724 --> 40:27.992
Quite so.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.060
MURDOCH: Well, he
shouldn't have.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.629
Because Virgil died
of a knife wound.

Oh, my--

40:33.064 --> 40:33.698

you propose it was, Detective?

40:45.510 --> 40:46.444
Who had been strangled.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.580
Are you suggesting that we
all mistook Eddie for Virgil?

40:49.580 --> 40:50.415
No, no.

40:50.415 --> 40:52.050
You didn't.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.751
Only the doctor and
Constable Morrison

40:53.751 --> 40:56.254
needed to assume that they
were looking at Virgil.

40:56.254 --> 40:57.588
So are you saying
that we willfully

40:57.588 --> 40:58.990
deceived those two men?

40:58.990 --> 41:02.593
That we were part of, what,
some Machiavellian plot?

41:02.593 --> 41:04.696
More Shakespearean, I'd say.

And what possible reason
could we have for this?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.701
Ah, yes.

I believe that's what
you call it in acting.

will find it here.

Brackenreid you

that's bothering you.

you please step out?

get closer to Miss Granger.

in fact seducing her.

43:36.280 --> 43:40.284
It was as if my
actions were not my own.

43:40.284 --> 43:43.154
And I understood Lady Macbeth
as I never had before.

43:43.154 --> 43:47.558
I don't even remember driving
the letter opener into him.

43:47.558 --> 43:50.128
I really must insist
that you stop at once.

43:50.128 --> 43:56.134
"False face must hide what
the false heart doth know."

43:56.134 --> 43:58.536
Oh.

43:58.536 --> 44:01.038
Very good.

44:01.038 --> 44:05.710
I wanted to turn myself in, but
the others talked me out of it.

44:05.710 --> 44:08.279
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

44:08.279 --> 44:11.516
Why did the others convince
you not to confess the truth?

44:11.516 --> 44:14.051
Oh, we would've
lost the theater.

44:14.051 --> 44:17.121
Hardly a reason to
kill someone for.

44:17.121 --> 44:19.023
I don't expect
you to understand,

44:19.023 --> 44:22.393
Detective, you're not an
actor, but without the theater,

44:22.393 --> 44:24.695
we are nothing.

44:24.695 --> 44:26.631
So you came up with this plan?

44:26.631 --> 44:27.465
No.

44:27.465 --> 44:29.634
No, we came up with this plan.

44:29.634 --> 44:30.434
That's not true.

44:30.434 --> 44:32.370
We didn't do anything.

44:32.370 --> 44:35.239
This plan-- it
included Eddie Green?

44:35.239 --> 44:37.475
No, poor Eddie.

44:37.475 --> 44:40.511
He was just hanging about, not
wanting to leave the limelight,

44:40.511 --> 44:41.445
and Arthur strangled him--

44:41.445 --> 44:42.313
Stella!

44:42.313 --> 44:45.216
For God's sake, you old buffoon.

44:45.216 --> 44:47.451
That's when Eddie's body
was switched with Virgil's.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.055
Yes.

44:51.055 --> 44:53.424
So Arthur locked
the office door

44:53.424 --> 44:54.992
and remained here
in the secret room

44:54.992 --> 44:57.094
with Virgil's corpse
all the while Constable

44:57.094 --> 44:59.130
Morrison was in the office.

44:59.130 --> 45:02.033
That's why he couldn't help
David break down the door.

45:02.033 --> 45:02.667
Crabtree?

45:02.667 --> 45:04.068
Morrison?

45:04.068 --> 45:07.038
Take these actors
to the station.

45:12.577 --> 45:20.251
Mrs. Smart-- I'm very
sorry, but you do

45:20.251 --> 45:24.088
realize I have no choice.

45:24.088 --> 45:25.556
Of course.

45:25.556 --> 45:30.394
You were, and will
always be, spectacular.

45:33.598 --> 45:34.465
Thank you.

45:37.068 --> 45:42.340
But this wretched, wretched
play-- it truly is cursed.

45:58.089 --> 45:59.323
Eddie Green.

45:59.323 --> 46:00.725
MURDOCH: Yes.

46:00.725 --> 46:03.294
No family.

46:03.294 --> 46:07.098
Apparently the
theater was his family.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.599
Not a particularly close one.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.433
No.

46:12.236 --> 46:13.738
Besides a name on
a playbill, what

46:13.738 --> 46:16.073
is there to remember him by?

46:16.073 --> 46:18.609
We'll never know what would
have become of Eddie Green.

46:18.609 --> 46:21.212
He was robbed of that.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.581
I'm surprised he's not being
buried with the paupers.

46:23.581 --> 46:26.317
And with no family, who
paid for the headstone?

46:31.255 --> 46:34.225
William-- did you
pay for his burial?

46:38.596 --> 46:41.999
"Life's but a walking
shadow, a poor player,

46:41.999 --> 46:44.468
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage,

46:44.468 --> 46:46.470
and then is heard no more.

46:46.470 --> 46:49.607
It is a tale told by an
idiot, full of sound and fury,

46:49.607 --> 46:53.544
signifying nothing."

46:53.544 --> 46:56.113
"Macbeth."

46:56.113 --> 46:58.182
Luckily for us, our
spirits live eternal, eh?

47:07.191 --> 47:10.461
