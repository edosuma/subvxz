that we could.

Did you, though?

Did you?

going on in your head.

is in the fridge

bathed, and pooped.

I've been taking her to
this baby group in the park

35:22.882 --> 35:24.949

love it if you were

35:24.951 --> 35:26.618
to pop by and say
hi to everyone.

35:29.021 --> 35:29.755
The baby group.

35:31.556 --> 35:34.557
Yeah, hangin' out with mommy
groups really isn't my thing.

35:34.559 --> 35:36.126
Did they need money?

35:36.128 --> 35:39.031
No, they just thought it would
be nice to meet the father.

35:41.433 --> 35:44.402

time, I'll let you know.

48:42.849 --> 48:43.783
We.

48:45.885 --> 48:47.887
We don't like to give
her a lot of sweets.

48:49.554 --> 48:51.456
I think you should let
me be the Grandmother.

48:52.257 --> 48:53.623
I just think...

48:53.625 --> 48:56.526
No, dear, it's not
your place to think.

48:56.528 --> 48:58.765
I've seen the way you
behave with this child.

49:00.900 --> 49:03.968
- Excuse me?
- It's highly unprofessional.

49:03.970 --> 49:07.004
You walk around like you
belong in this family.

49:07.006 --> 49:08.005
Mrs. Matthews...

49:08.007 --> 49:10.340
I know you lost your child.

49:10.342 --> 49:13.010
I talked to the Dunhills.

49:13.012 --> 49:16.914
They said they had to let you
go because you were depressed

49:16.916 --> 49:19.016
and unfit for the job.

49:19.018 --> 49:20.920
(BABY SOFTLY CRYING)
No.

49:21.888 --> 49:23.288
I'll take care of her.

49:24.791 --> 49:27.490
I'm reminded everyday
of what I lost.

49:27.492 --> 49:29.860
Well, that baby is not yours.

49:29.862 --> 49:33.898
And you are not going
to replace her mother.

49:33.900 --> 49:35.233
- You...
- No!

49:48.981 --> 49:49.914
Hey, let's do this again, huh?

49:49.916 --> 49:51.481
Absolutely.

49:51.483 --> 49:53.683

50:26.585 --> 50:27.652
Why are you here?

50:29.021 --> 50:31.621
I came to see
my granddaughter.

50:31.623 --> 50:32.992
I called but you didn't answer.

50:34.026 --> 50:36.526
(SOFTLY SIGHS) Are you drunk?

50:36.528 --> 50:37.362
I'm fine.

50:42.769 --> 50:43.868
Where's Jessee?

50:43.870 --> 50:46.005
It's late, I put her to bed.

50:47.907 --> 50:49.407
And I sent Sage away.

50:56.916 --> 50:58.483
I'm sorry, you did what?

51:00.753 --> 51:02.418
I sent her away.

51:02.420 --> 51:06.090
I got tired of her finagling
her way into this family.

51:06.092 --> 51:07.524
- Jessee is not her...
- Mom!

51:07.526 --> 51:08.926
You need to stop.

51:08.928 --> 51:11.729
Luke, I did it for
you and for the baby.

51:11.731 --> 51:13.063
She is not a part
of this family.

51:13.065 --> 51:16.066
You didn't do for our family.

51:16.068 --> 51:18.468
Like everything else,
you did it for yourself.

51:18.470 --> 51:19.304
Oh, Luke.

51:22.909 --> 51:24.775
You wanna know why
I pushed you away?

51:24.777 --> 51:26.511
I mean, ya gotta
be curious, right?

51:28.613 --> 51:30.415
You smothered me my entire life.

51:33.052 --> 51:34.551
Well, it must have worked

51:34.553 --> 51:35.953
because look how
good you turned out.

51:35.955 --> 51:39.992
Oh my God, you are
so arrogant sometimes.

51:42.929 --> 51:45.031
I turned out the way I
did because of Jessica.

51:47.033 --> 51:51.634
School, my business,
because of Jessica, not you.

51:51.636 --> 51:52.937
Well, Sage isn't Jessica.

51:52.939 --> 51:55.906
She's not your family
to control anymore.

51:55.908 --> 51:57.074

are you going?

51:57.076 --> 51:58.044

wanted someone to talk to.

52:22.201 --> 52:23.135
Well, it's perfect timing.

52:25.004 --> 52:27.039
We just got into town
for the show tomorrow.

52:28.540 --> 52:29.608
You're coming, right?

52:38.818 --> 52:39.752
Sage, I'm sorry.

52:42.054 --> 52:46.025
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you lost the baby.

52:47.592 --> 52:48.895
It was our baby.

52:49.996 --> 52:52.631
Yeah, yeah, our baby.

52:54.566 --> 52:55.799
I'm sorry.

52:55.801 --> 52:57.234
It's fine.

52:57.236 --> 52:58.603
No, it's not fine.

53:01.606 --> 53:03.608
I was confused, you know?

53:05.543 --> 53:07.947
I shoulda done a lot
better, Sage, and I'm sorry.

53:10.016 --> 53:12.517
And then to hear what
that woman said to you...

53:14.519 --> 53:17.021
One for you, miss,
one for you, sir.

53:17.023 --> 53:18.655
Thank you.

53:18.657 --> 53:21.928

drink anymore, not since...

happens to you.

53:29.001 --> 53:30.202
Can't be scared of a drink.

53:31.938 --> 53:34.506
I was just alone for a
really long time after I was...

53:37.176 --> 53:39.879
Listen, you don't have
to explain that to me.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.047
And after every show,

53:43.049 --> 53:44.982
I would wanna hear from you.

53:44.984 --> 53:48.584
I would get out my phone,
I would look at it,

53:48.586 --> 53:50.520
I would look at your number
and I would just stare at it

53:50.522 --> 53:51.924
and I'd wanna hear from you.

53:58.596 --> 54:00.766

what it's like

54:14.246 --> 54:16.782
with his mother growing up, I
mean, it must have been hell.

liked me much.

died, for a long time after,

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:13.523

01:02:23.803 --> 01:02:24.735

that the reason I've
treated you that way

01:02:40.152 --> 01:02:42.154
is because you remind me of her.

about in my life and,

wouldn't be room for me.

I don't know what to say.

01:03:03.843 --> 01:03:06.777

the man you were with.

01:03:06.779 --> 01:03:08.612
I wish I'd been there.

01:03:08.614 --> 01:03:10.080

him know how we deal

that on the ranch.

become a part of the family

the boys to ride horses.

that on your resume?

She sounds really great.

01:16:19.972 --> 01:16:20.572
She was.

01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:24.109
When I first met her, I was

01:16:25.544 --> 01:16:28.514
always looking for the
next beer run party.

01:16:30.082 --> 01:16:32.584
She got me focused,
pushed me to be a doctor.

01:16:34.219 --> 01:16:36.255
And I just assumed you
loved the female anatomy.

01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:39.858
Sounds kinda cheesy but,

01:16:41.327 --> 01:16:43.193
I became an OB because
I just loved the idea

01:16:43.195 --> 01:16:46.563
of being there when
a family starts.

01:16:46.565 --> 01:16:48.598
Seeing that look
on a father's face

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.601
when he first sees his child.

Well, Dr. Matthews,

01:17:02.581 --> 01:17:04.616
you do have a soft
side under there.

01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:08.018
Yeah, somewhere under there.

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.353
How 'bout you?

01:17:09.355 --> 01:17:12.122
All I know about you is
that you are an Aussie

01:17:12.124 --> 01:17:14.091
and you used to ride horses.

01:17:14.093 --> 01:17:16.193
Every weekend
when I was a kid,

01:17:16.195 --> 01:17:17.961
my dad taught me to barrel race

01:17:17.963 --> 01:17:21.600
and I loved it so much
that I started competing.

01:17:23.102 --> 01:17:24.067
Like a real cowgirl.

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:26.002
Yes, like a real cowgirl.

01:17:26.004 --> 01:17:26.438
Hm.

01:17:28.006 --> 01:17:31.477
The summer I sold my
horses was really rough.

01:17:33.011 --> 01:17:34.211
My mum moved back
here to the states

01:17:34.213 --> 01:17:35.679
and my dad stayed in Adelaide

01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:38.648
and he had to sell the
horses just to get by,

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:40.119
and that was that.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.120
I buried myself in music,

01:17:43.122 --> 01:17:46.992
and my horses just
became a faded memory.

01:17:47.993 --> 01:17:51.096
So the cowgirl has a past.

01:17:52.464 --> 01:17:53.298
Yeah.

01:17:55.601 --> 01:17:59.238
You don't have to
answer this but, Allen?

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.174
Yeah.

01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.243
Girls like bad guys, I guess.

01:18:06.245 --> 01:18:07.577
Mm-hm.

01:18:07.579 --> 01:18:10.514
Mm-hm, I met him
back home at a show

01:18:10.516 --> 01:18:14.050
when his band was doing
smaller opening acts,

01:18:14.052 --> 01:18:16.321
and at first, I was just
another girl to him.

01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:19.156
Then he made me feel special.

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:23.026
Dedicated songs to me onstage,
winked at me during solos.

01:18:23.028 --> 01:18:23.595
I loved it.

01:18:25.264 --> 01:18:28.033
Then I followed him to the
states when he got signed.

01:18:31.203 --> 01:18:33.138
And then he changed, real quick.

01:18:35.174 --> 01:18:37.374
Our late nights became
his late nights.

01:18:37.376 --> 01:18:40.012
He stopped sleeping on the
bus and disappeared a lot.

01:18:42.014 --> 01:18:43.048
Then I got pregnant.

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:48.151
Yeah, and he adopted
the rockstar lifestyle.

01:18:48.153 --> 01:18:50.489
Yeah, things became
too real, he said.

01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:54.259
Needed to work on
touring and his work.

01:18:55.694 --> 01:18:58.428
He said he'd send me
money and I'd be set.

01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:01.097
Until the other night,
the last I saw him

01:19:01.099 --> 01:19:04.067
or heard from him was
when the bus pulled out

01:19:04.069 --> 01:19:05.037
and he headed east.

01:19:08.307 --> 01:19:10.175

and emails and texts.

And I'm about three months along

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:27.760
and he tells me I
shouldn't call him anymore.

01:19:28.828 --> 01:19:31.129
I'm upsetting his artistic flow.

01:19:31.831 --> 01:19:32.431

and call him out?

01:19:39.538 --> 01:19:41.839

makes me look crazy

01:19:41.841 --> 01:19:43.375
and I'm still left alone.

01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:13.964
No.

01:26:13.966 --> 01:26:16.532
Well, they come from
the sea, not the earth.

01:26:16.534 --> 01:26:18.905
They don't have to
be cut or polished.

01:26:19.972 --> 01:26:20.773
They're born.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:26.711
And when they're born, they
come out strong and beautiful.

01:26:28.546 --> 01:26:29.980
That's what my
mother-in-law told me

01:26:29.982 --> 01:26:31.583
that night before I got married.

01:26:34.486 --> 01:26:36.122
When she gave me this ring.

01:26:41.559 --> 01:26:42.962
It's like you, Sage.

01:26:44.596 --> 01:26:49.501
You are strong, and
beautiful, and unique,

01:26:50.269 --> 01:26:50.903
and I want you to have it.

01:26:51.871 --> 01:26:53.837
I can't accept this.

01:26:53.839 --> 01:26:55.139
I'm not the one you
wanna give this to.

01:26:55.141 --> 01:26:57.009
Yes, you are.

01:26:58.244 --> 01:27:00.210
You are, dear.

01:27:00.212 --> 01:27:01.213
It's just...

01:27:03.816 --> 01:27:04.716
You don't know me.

01:27:06.651 --> 01:27:07.485

Luke, okay, your mum...

Hey, what'd she say now?

This isn't how
it's supposed to go.

01:27:29.241 --> 01:27:31.308
How what was?

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:33.946
This was meant to
be a job, just a job.

01:27:37.883 --> 01:27:39.615
