(LASERS FIRING)

00:29.162 --> 00:30.629
This is your last warning.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.665
The Justice League
is totally here

00:33.700 --> 00:35.534
to put an end
to your villainy.

00:39.005 --> 00:40.705
FIRESTORM: Oh, the heat is on!

00:40.740 --> 00:41.873
(GRUNTS)

00:41.908 --> 00:44.709
(SCREAMING) Excuse me.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.111
(MOANS)

00:46.680 --> 00:48.080
Stargirl!

00:48.115 --> 00:49.281
Watch where
you're shooting!

00:49.316 --> 00:51.683
Ugh, watch where
you're flying.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.984
Ugh!

00:53.019 --> 00:54.252
I got this!

00:54.287 --> 00:56.388
-Khaji Da, sword.

(LAUGHS)

01:09.136 --> 01:10.902
Do you think this
is the first time

01:10.937 --> 01:12.571
the great General Zod and I

01:12.606 --> 01:15.640
have fought your
pathetic Justice League?

01:15.675 --> 01:18.477
We will make the people
of this planet suffer...

01:20.213 --> 01:21.847
For our incarceration!

01:24.951 --> 01:26.251
(SCREAMS)

01:33.493 --> 01:36.428
Like, how did we even
get into this mess?

01:38.965 --> 01:40.398
What're you looking at me for?

01:40.433 --> 01:41.700
The Fortress of Solitude

01:41.735 --> 01:43.602
is the Justice League's
secondary headquarters

01:43.637 --> 01:45.737
should anything happen to
the Watchtower.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.206
As members, we want you
to familiarize yourselves

01:48.241 --> 01:50.375
with the security systems
and layout.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.245
ALL: Whoa.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.486
Alien kitty.

02:01.521 --> 02:02.988
-(KITTEN MEWS)
-Ooh.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.457
It's so cute.

02:05.492 --> 02:08.560
-(SLURP)
-And goopey.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.428
That does not
negate the cuteness.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.465
If you like that,
you're going to love this.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.700
Welcome to the Krypton room,

02:15.735 --> 02:17.469
which holds one of the
most important items

02:17.504 --> 02:18.904
in the entire fortress.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.374
The Phantom Zone Projector.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.376
A dimension set safely apart
from our own.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.911
My people use this
to transport

02:25.946 --> 02:28.713
our most dangerous criminals
into the Phantom Zone.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.783
-(KITTEN YOWLS)

-(LASERS FIRING)
-Well, you made it worse.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.360
I'll fix this.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.728
You, basically,
got two buttons, right?

02:43.763 --> 02:45.797
I mean,
how hard is this to figure?

02:45.832 --> 02:47.833
Wait, Ronald,
I don't think you should...

02:51.004 --> 02:52.637
Do that.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.806
Okay, yes, it's bad
but for the record,

02:54.841 --> 02:56.942
Blue Beetle made it
a million times worse.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.143
I got this.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.711
(MACHINE POWERS DOWN)

03:04.451 --> 03:06.551
-(LASERS FIRING)
-Come on, this should be easy.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.587
Without exposure to
Earth's yellow sun

03:08.622 --> 03:11.423
those Kryptonians are
regular non-powered thugs.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.460
And is it just me
or did it get really quiet.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.797
FIRESTORM:
Hey, where'd they go?

03:25.639 --> 03:27.639
Yes, I got them.
North quadrant.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.241
And now...

03:33.947 --> 03:37.449
You can start to thank me
for saving the day.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.050
You do realize
you've trapped them

03:39.085 --> 03:40.452
in the arsenal room, right?

03:40.487 --> 03:41.954
The arsenal what now?

03:42.956 --> 03:44.923
(EXPLOSION)

03:51.298 --> 03:53.231
STARGIRL: They're blasting
their way towards the exit.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.333
We have to stop them
before they get outside

03:55.368 --> 03:56.801
and power up on solar energy.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.737
Okay, think.
They're Kryptonian.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.273
So they're weaknesses
are same as Superman's.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.607
-Which means...
-Kryptonite!

04:02.642 --> 04:05.210
Firestorm, use your
nuclear magic

04:05.245 --> 04:06.511
to whip us up some Kryptonite.

04:06.546 --> 04:07.612
That's easier said than done.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.547
Did you just say
"nuclear magic?"

04:09.582 --> 04:12.017
Um, I'm gonna be honest.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.853
We don't exactly get
how your powers work.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.622
I'm not Shazam!
I don't have magic.

04:17.657 --> 04:19.824
I just rearrange molecules
but it helps

04:19.859 --> 04:22.794
if I know what kind of
molecules we're talking about.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.729
-Professor?
-I'm sorry, Ronald.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.265
If it was a terrestrial object
I could be of use

04:27.300 --> 04:28.833
but Kryptonite
is completely...

04:28.868 --> 04:31.003
-Wait, shh!
Do you hear that?

that security door's
gonna hold out.

(EXPLOSION)

06:36.529 --> 06:37.662

06:37.697 --> 06:39.964
Growing a backbone?

06:39.999 --> 06:42.901
(LAUGHING)
The Justice League never runs.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.703
Unless it's running
to get something.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.572
Uh! That sounded so uncool.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.841
I hope you had fun because
this is the last time

06:49.876 --> 06:51.342
you're setting foot
on our planet.

06:51.377 --> 06:54.612
All thanks to a little
something we like to call

06:54.647 --> 06:56.114
Kryptonite!

07:00.987 --> 07:02.187
Kryptonite!

07:03.823 --> 07:05.190
Hmm.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.660
(CHUCKLES)

07:08.695 --> 07:11.463
Did you really think
Kryptonite that small

07:11.498 --> 07:12.998
would affect us?

07:24.310 --> 07:25.643
Subjugating this planet

07:25.678 --> 07:28.713
is going to be much easier
than we thought.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.187
(EXPLOSION)

07:41.127 --> 07:43.528
I can feel the power.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.371
No, no, no, this is my fault.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.574
Who knew my love
of adorable kitties
would turn against me.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.243
We all messed up.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.211
We should have been
working together
this whole time.

08:00.246 --> 08:01.579
Not arguing.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.848
Ho-ho, but it's not
too late to fix that.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.651
You speculating what
I'm speculating, Ronald?

08:06.686 --> 08:07.852
You know it, Prof!

08:07.887 --> 08:09.621
If we can figure out the
atomic structure

08:09.656 --> 08:10.989
of Kryptonite from this piece

08:11.024 --> 08:13.458
then the heat's back on. Woo!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.193
But we're gonna
need a little time.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.662
BLUE BEETLE: You got it!
STARGIRL: Just leave it to us.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.999

<i>of learning the basic parts.</i>

08:24.671 --> 08:27.171
Hey, that doesn't
look too hard.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.274
Oh, there's more.
(LAUGHS) Okay.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.477
Oh, that's a lot, that's...
It keeps coming.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.812
Why does it keep coming?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.147
Can we just stop it,
Professor? Seriously.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.882
I don't think I studied
any of this at all.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.717
Oh, why, there's another page.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.452
(PANICS) I can't handle
the information!

08:41.487 --> 08:44.722
It just keeps coming
and coming.
Stop the information!

08:44.757 --> 08:46.324
I'm going to explode!

08:46.359 --> 08:48.026
PROFESSOR STEIN:
Concentrate, Ronald.
Concentrate.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.928
Do you think
I'm Stephen Hawking?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.632
This is totally
your last warning.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.836
Throw down your weapons
or get ready to fight!

09:00.406 --> 09:02.007
Oh, crud, they can fly.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.081

09:29.168 --> 09:31.336
My loyal soldiers,

09:31.371 --> 09:33.204
care to help me end this?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.043
(GROANS)

09:41.981 --> 09:44.849
With great powers
comes a great big
butt-kicking!

09:45.351 --> 09:46.784
Uh.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.386
Took you long enough.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.787
What can I say?

09:49.822 --> 09:53.891
Chemistry, ho-ho,
it is not my best subject.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.094
And then, Firestorm
and the Professor

09:56.129 --> 09:57.929
fixed the
Phantom Zone Projector.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.131
And don't worry about
those Kryptonite chains.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.301
Firestorm's absorbing
all the green energy
coming this way.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.838
(LAUGHING) It's like having
your own alien heat lamp.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.074
Argh! Aren't these chains
enough of an indignity?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.877
How much more of this
teenage blather
must we endure?

10:12.912 --> 10:14.646
Not much at all, Zod.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.047
(BEEPS)

10:17.383 --> 10:18.382
(SCREAMING)

10:20.286 --> 10:22.587
I'm glad you three
were able to accomplish
so much

10:22.622 --> 10:23.821
working together.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.456
Because now you can put
all that teamwork

10:25.491 --> 10:27.092
into cleaning up this mess.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.131
Starting with that.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.366
Alien kitty!
