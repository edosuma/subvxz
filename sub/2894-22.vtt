WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:06.638
Hawkeye: And so we bid
a fond farewell
to dimension z.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.707
After saving it from
annihilation, that is.

00:08.709 --> 00:08.707
Iron man:
Everyone, strap in.

00:08.709 --> 00:13.612
Tearing holes
between realities
can get a little bumpy.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.014
Go on, goldilocks.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.782
Buckle into
your booster-seat.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.752
I've no fear of injury,
gamma troll!

00:19.754 --> 00:21.754
But perhaps you should
be restrained...

00:21.756 --> 00:23.155
For your own safety.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.057
(loud thud)
(alarms blaring)

00:25.059 --> 00:26.425
Iron man:
Cosmic turbulence, incoming.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.560
Hold on to something!

00:28.562 --> 00:34.733
(both groaning)

00:34.735 --> 00:36.668
Hulk:
Get off me, goldie!
What're you doin'?

00:36.670 --> 00:39.571
Let go of me!
(grunts)

00:39.573 --> 00:42.307
Whoa, planetary alarms
are going crazy!

00:42.309 --> 00:44.143
Sounds like
we missed a party.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.045
What happened?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.780
That happened!

00:47.782 --> 00:52.084
Hawkeye:
Uh, I'd like to go back
to dimension z now, please.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.053
He has returned, avengers.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.121
The devourer of worlds.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.556
Galactus!

00:57.558 --> 01:00.392
Iron man: And he's
already past
the appetizer stage.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.661
Avengers, we've got
less than five minutes

01:02.663 --> 01:05.330
Before galactus powers up
his munch-o-tron

01:05.331 --> 01:07.699
And sucks all the energy
from earth.

01:07.701 --> 01:17.076
We don't stop him now,
there'll be nothing left.

01:17.078 --> 01:17.076
So what's the plan?

01:17.078 --> 01:21.380
I've prepared
a strategy specifically
to deal with his return.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.849
Thor, summon every electron
within 100 kilometers.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.717
One bolt. Make it count.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.519
Hawkeye, break out
the heavy artillery.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.321
Tony, route all
uni-beam power...

01:29.323 --> 01:30.856
Cap, I never told you this,

01:30.858 --> 01:33.559
But I only went along with
your galactus prep drills

01:33.561 --> 01:35.561
Because I thought
he'd never come back.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.363
Now that he's here...
Captain america: Oh, no.
You are not going rogue.

01:38.365 --> 01:41.100
The entire planet's at stake.
We need to act as a team.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.802
And hopefully, you will.
Hawkeye: Hopefully,
we will?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.271
We're not the ones
pulling a stark!

01:46.273 --> 01:55.414
(growls)

01:55.416 --> 01:58.383
Captain america:
<i>Iron man. I assume you've got</i>
<i>your own plan, as usual?</i>

01:58.385 --> 02:00.752
The plan is "trust me."

02:00.754 --> 02:02.421
Iron man:
<i>To save the earth,</i>
<i>we need to be willing</i>

02:02.423 --> 02:06.658
<i>To make any sacrifice.</i>

02:06.660 --> 02:18.470
(mechanical whirring)

02:18.472 --> 02:21.673
Jarvis, lock onto
galactus' data stream.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.375
If I'm going to talk
to the big guy,

02:23.377 --> 02:25.511
I need to broadcast
on the same frequency.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.812
Okay, tony.

02:26.814 --> 02:32.151
Time to put your money
where your mind is.

02:32.153 --> 02:38.323
Activate pulse!

02:38.325 --> 02:40.392
(grunts)

02:40.394 --> 02:42.928
(straining)

02:42.930 --> 02:46.798
Few have attained
direct communication
with galactus.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.568
You are unlikely to survive.

02:49.570 --> 02:53.472
Well, the seven billion
other people on this planet

02:53.474 --> 02:55.707
Aren't going
to fare any better.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.276
<i>Regrettable,</i>

02:57.278 --> 02:59.344
<i>But galactus hungers.</i>

02:59.346 --> 03:01.880
And galactus must feed.

03:01.882 --> 03:14.626
That's what
I wanted to discuss.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.228
Iron man, no!

03:16.230 --> 03:19.431
Hmm?
Huh?

03:19.433 --> 03:29.474
That was his plan?

03:29.476 --> 03:40.819
That was his plan?

03:40.821 --> 03:44.356
Iron man has perished?
This cannot be!

03:44.358 --> 03:47.259
Why is he always
puling these crazy moves
and not telling us?

03:47.261 --> 03:48.827
'cause that's what he does.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.431
You think he actually
sacrificed himself
for a greater good?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.333
Falcon:
No way. Jarvis,

03:54.335 --> 03:56.001
Replay event from
onboard recorders.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.469
Extreme slo-mo.

03:57.471 --> 04:01.873
Full-spectrum enhancement!

04:01.875 --> 04:03.408
See? Evaporated.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.244
Not evaporated. Teleported.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.479
Tony's armor has
a built-in trace frequency.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.281
Micro-pings that
only we can track.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.882
Even across light-years.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.720
Captain america: Strap in
for hyperspace travel.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.921
You first.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.889
Together then.

04:17.891 --> 04:27.566
Huh. Knew you were chicken.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.434
Hawkeye:
So once again
our so-called leader

04:29.436 --> 04:32.504
Calls his own plays
and leaves the rest of us
out in the cold.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.772
He did one thing right,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.641
He got galactus
off the earth.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.643
But there's something else.
It looks like tony

04:37.645 --> 04:40.712
Engaged in some sort of
ultra-high-speed
data exchange.

04:40.714 --> 04:40.712
You mean
he and galactus entered

04:40.714 --> 04:44.583
Their own private chat room?
What'd they talk about?

04:44.585 --> 04:47.552
The computer wasn't
fast enough to decipher it.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.388
Scanners have a lock
on iron man's signal.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.891
He's close.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.826
Jarvis:
<i>Position established.</i>
<i>Outer spiral arm,</i>

04:54.828 --> 04:56.428
<i>The d'bari system.</i>

04:56.430 --> 04:56.428
We need a plan.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.699
Let's all just fly off
and do our own thing.
That's what tony did!

05:00.701 --> 05:03.335
We don't know
what tony did.
That's my point.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.870
(alarm beeping)

05:04.872 --> 05:17.649
Collision alert!

05:17.651 --> 05:20.485
Huh, they're not attacking.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.888
Thor: No weapons.
These are not warships.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.423
Captain america:
They're transport vessels.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.824
Millions of them.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.626
It's an evacuation. But why?

05:27.628 --> 05:30.529
One giant guess.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.098
Scan the planet.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.600
Falcon: It's there.
Center of the main city.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.336
Galactus' machine.

05:37.338 --> 05:43.875
What of our armored ally?

05:43.877 --> 05:48.113
Look! Another ship
is coming in!

05:48.115 --> 05:49.915
It's on intercept.
Try and lose them.

05:49.917 --> 05:59.624
We don't have time
for a fight.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.759
(circuits scrambling)

06:00.761 --> 06:03.762
Uh-oh. Comm is down!

06:03.764 --> 06:04.830
Falcon: And so are
the shields!

06:04.832 --> 06:12.804
Tractor beam's got us!

06:12.806 --> 06:21.680
Be ready for anything.

06:21.682 --> 06:29.821
(growling)

06:29.823 --> 06:32.791
What did I tell you,
drax? Looters!

06:32.793 --> 06:35.594
Lowest life forms
in the universe, gamora.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.463
Didn't reckon on
running into us guardians.

06:38.465 --> 06:41.466
I am groot.

06:41.468 --> 06:44.636
Ha! By the spires
of asgard,

06:44.638 --> 06:46.938
The guardians
of the galaxy!

06:46.940 --> 06:49.975
Sorry, avengers.
Thought you were looters.

06:49.977 --> 06:53.011
As you can tell,
we don't have a lot of
time for diplomacy.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.947
That depends, star-lord.
What's happening here?

06:55.949 --> 06:58.650
Nothing that concerns you,
I guarantee it.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.086
Perhaps we should be
the judge of that.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.456
Yeah, at least we don't have
a cutesy animal mascot

07:04.458 --> 07:08.160
And a talking pencil.

07:08.162 --> 07:11.596
Call me "mascot" again.
Please.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.565
(weapon charging)
uh...

07:13.567 --> 07:15.567
Rocket, back off!

07:15.569 --> 07:18.170
(growls)

07:18.172 --> 07:19.838
(growls)

07:19.840 --> 07:21.740
Look, captain,
if you must know,

07:21.742 --> 07:24.042
We're evacuating
10 billion d'bari.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.877
Well, we're here to find
a missing teammate,

07:25.879 --> 07:27.846
Not interfere
in your operations.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.748
He just happened to visit
at the exact time

07:29.750 --> 07:32.083
Galactus targeted
this planet for consumption?

07:32.085 --> 07:33.885
He's got bad timing
like that.

07:33.887 --> 07:39.925
I have a feeling
it's not a coincidence.

07:39.927 --> 07:44.830
Star-lord: Drax,
gamora, take us in low.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.666
Wow. This place
is incredible.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.836
Gamora: Unfortunately,
unless we can halt
galactus' progress,

07:50.838 --> 07:52.904
The d'bari will have
to find a new homeworld.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.906
(thudding)
(all grunt)

07:54.908 --> 07:56.942
Another outsider ship?

07:56.944 --> 08:02.080
Not a ship. A humanoid.

08:02.082 --> 08:09.521
He's coming in fast.
Strap in.

08:09.523 --> 08:14.693
Falcon:
He's coming in for us.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.128
Let me go smash
his glowy butt!

08:17.130 --> 08:20.732
Good luck, he wields
the power cosmic.

08:20.734 --> 08:24.769
That power is dispensed
only by galactus himself!

08:24.771 --> 08:27.105
We're fighting
a herald of galactus?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.574
Guys, that's no herald.

08:29.576 --> 08:37.716
It's tony!

08:37.717 --> 08:44.689
Rocket, shoot
to disable only.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.592
Captain america:
He's coming in.
Brace yourselves.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.061
(all groaning)

08:50.063 --> 08:51.730
Such power!

08:51.732 --> 08:53.832
It rivals asgard's finest!

08:53.834 --> 08:55.634
I told you to strap in.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.636
Never!
Never!

08:57.638 --> 08:59.938
Hull breach!
Gamora: Losing altitude!

08:59.940 --> 09:01.940
Why is your friend
attacking us?

09:01.942 --> 09:04.009
He's usually not that evil.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.577
I am groot!

09:05.579 --> 09:11.249
Yeah, I got that.

09:11.251 --> 09:17.622
Friend or not,
we gotta take action.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.725
(grunts)

09:20.727 --> 09:23.562
This makes no sense.
What is tony doing?

09:23.564 --> 09:26.631
It's obvious. He traded
your world for this one.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.999
He serves the devourer now.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.036
He wouldn't let an entire
civilization be destroyed.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.238
Not even to save his own?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.874
Iron man, stand down.
The avengers are aboard...

09:35.876 --> 09:37.976
(explosion)
(all grunt)

09:37.978 --> 09:41.613
Of all times to finally
stop talking, he picks now.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.748
What's the status
of d'bari evacuation?

09:43.750 --> 09:47.052
97%. A few ships
are having engine failures.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.120
I want that number at 100%.

09:49.122 --> 09:53.358
Star-lord: Bring us in.
We'll tractor them out.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.293
Falcon: How did you
evacuate a planet?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.862
Star-lord: Hey,
it's what we do.
Most inhabited planets

09:57.864 --> 10:00.332
Have a galactus
contingency plan in place.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.133
Doesn't earth?

10:02.135 --> 10:06.137
Earth has the mighty avengers
to keep it safe, doesn't it?

10:06.139 --> 10:10.709
Uh...

10:10.711 --> 10:12.811
Took out our main cannons!

10:12.813 --> 10:12.811
The <i> lady's</i>
too big a target.

10:12.813 --> 10:17.015
Let's take the party exterior
and deal with that herald.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.317
Stay put.
We won't be long.

10:19.319 --> 10:26.925
"stay put"?

10:26.927 --> 10:28.927
Tony said he had a plan.
You think this is it?

10:28.929 --> 10:32.063
We'll never find out
if the guardians
shoot him out of the sky.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.265
We can't let them
take down iron man.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.235
Yeah, no one busts up
our shellhead but us!

10:37.237 --> 10:39.904
Verily! Follow me
to victory... Argh!

10:39.906 --> 10:47.879
(hulk grunts)

10:47.881 --> 10:51.016
(both grunting)

10:51.018 --> 10:54.085
He's helping galactus
devour a planet, viking!

10:54.087 --> 10:56.254
I am not a viking!

10:56.256 --> 10:59.924
(both grunting)

10:59.926 --> 11:01.192
I am groot!

11:01.194 --> 11:05.030
Get off or get smashed,
toothpick!

11:05.032 --> 11:07.899
(grunting)

11:07.901 --> 11:10.769
Have all the avengers
gone crazy?

11:10.771 --> 11:13.104
Probably,
they're earthlings.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.975
No offense.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.343
On my way, tony.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.111
Argh, get off me!
Keep steady, will ya?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.980
You're throwing off
my aim!

11:21.982 --> 11:28.319
Careful. Rodents are
a bird's natural enemy.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.988
So's the ground.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.258
Whoa!

11:33.260 --> 11:40.231
(grunts)

11:40.233 --> 11:42.267
What is your damage,
earthling?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.936
You wanna see
some damage, lady?

11:44.938 --> 11:59.050
Watch where you
point those sticks!

11:59.052 --> 12:01.753
Star-lord, stand down!
He's one of us.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.788
Besides, there's a bigger
threat to deal with.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.357
You bet there is, and your
teammate's the cause of it.

12:06.359 --> 12:16.401
He may have saved your world,
but what about this one?

12:16.403 --> 12:26.511
He may have saved your world,
but what about this one?

12:26.513 --> 12:36.221
He may have saved your world,
but what about this one?

12:36.223 --> 12:37.756
I am groot.

12:37.758 --> 12:50.135
You don't say?

12:50.137 --> 12:52.137
The herald is
attacking those ships!

12:52.139 --> 13:02.180
No, I... I'm pretty sure
he's saving them.

13:02.182 --> 13:10.288
No, I... I'm pretty sure
he's saving them.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.356
He's here.

13:11.358 --> 13:23.268
And he looks
very, very hungry.

13:23.270 --> 13:35.914
I am groot!

13:35.916 --> 13:38.316
Herald or no,
I think we both agree

13:38.318 --> 13:40.051
That we need
to take galactus out.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.253
No argument there,
so let's work together.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.556
The last d'bari ships
have cleared the planet.

13:44.558 --> 13:48.326
Finally! We can let slip
the dogs of war!

13:48.328 --> 13:50.261
I suggest we combine
our expertise.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.063
Pair up.
One from each team.

13:52.065 --> 13:57.368
Think we already did.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.138
Me and you?
Don't get in my way.

14:00.140 --> 14:04.375
Why are the green ones
always so mean?

14:04.377 --> 14:05.510
I am groot!

14:05.512 --> 14:13.418
(hulk roars)

14:13.420 --> 14:16.521
Rocket raccoon:
Fly straight,
feather-head!

14:16.523 --> 14:28.967
Shoot straight, furball!

14:28.969 --> 14:30.468
Follow my lead, viking.

14:30.470 --> 14:37.108
I am not a viking!

14:37.110 --> 14:41.446
(grunts)

14:41.448 --> 14:43.081
Star-lord,
you have to listen.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.983
I know how it looks,

14:44.985 --> 14:49.087
But tony stark
always has a plan.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.257
If this is his plan,
it's failing.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.058
Star-lord: Gamora,
hawkeye, you're up.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.227
I think
I've located a weakness.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.996
There. That intake.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.465
It must be feeding
into the reactor core.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.367
Just hit the mark
with one of these,

15:02.369 --> 15:04.102
And it'll cause
a chain reaction!

15:04.104 --> 15:06.337
Well, why didn't you
say so, sister?

15:06.339 --> 15:11.042
(hawkeye grunts)

15:11.044 --> 15:11.943
(both yelling)

15:11.945 --> 15:13.544
Whoa!

15:13.546 --> 15:19.083
(yelling)

15:19.085 --> 15:22.086
Huh?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.188
Uh, remember me? Clint?

15:24.190 --> 15:27.225
How I turned your arc reactor
into a popcorn machine?

15:27.227 --> 15:29.260
Used your helmet
as an ice bucket?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.262
Come on,
I'm so memorable.

15:31.264 --> 15:37.669
Whoa!

15:37.671 --> 15:39.470
Hawkeye: Okay,
maybe you
don't remember me,

15:39.472 --> 15:42.373
But I bet
you remember this.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.076
Call it my
"anti-iron man" arrow.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.680
Built specifically by you,
to take out your armor.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.649
First, you save me.
Now you destroy a planet.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.217
Whose side are you on?

15:53.219 --> 15:55.186
Iron man: I serve galactus.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.156
The tony I knew
would never do this.
Why help him?

15:58.158 --> 15:59.724
Galactus hungers.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.126
Galactus must feed.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.996
We saved each other's lives
a dozen times over.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.197
But you tell me
what your game is,

16:06.199 --> 16:08.266
Or I swear,
I will drop you.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.336
Galactus must feed.

16:11.338 --> 16:16.207
Huh?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.109
Guys! I think
the iron herald

16:18.111 --> 16:19.410
Has some kind of plan
or something!

16:19.412 --> 16:20.578
<i>No, I'm sure of it!</i>

16:20.580 --> 16:23.147
He spoke to you?
What did he say?

16:23.149 --> 16:26.317
Uh, "galactus must feed!"

16:26.319 --> 16:28.353
Nope. Nothing sinister there.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.521
Hawkeye: <i> Okay.</i>
<i>Not encouraging, I know.</i>

16:30.523 --> 16:32.724
But it was
the way he said it.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.993
Listen, you just
gotta trust me, okay?

16:34.995 --> 16:36.060
You're sure?

16:36.062 --> 16:37.528
Uh, 60-40.

16:37.530 --> 16:41.032
Avengers!
Cease all hostilities
against galactus.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.667
Are you crazy?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.502
You heard the man.
Stand down.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.070
Falcon: But what about
the guardians?

16:46.072 --> 16:49.574
Who's gonna convince them?

16:49.576 --> 16:52.043
Star-lord:
Guardians, they
may be earth's mightiest,

16:52.045 --> 16:54.078
But we protect the galaxy!

16:54.080 --> 17:06.089
Pour it on and do not stop!

17:06.092 --> 17:08.226
Star-lord: Keep it up!
This is our opening!

17:08.228 --> 17:15.767
Take your shot!

17:15.769 --> 17:17.801
I am...

17:17.804 --> 17:17.801
Groot!

17:17.804 --> 17:22.205
Bring down that herald
by any means necessary.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.675
Any means? Are you sure?

17:24.676 --> 17:27.111
There's still a man
in there, pete.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.780
Star-lord: This is
bigger than any one man.

17:28.782 --> 17:29.781
Bring him down.

17:29.783 --> 17:32.083
I... Am...

17:32.085 --> 17:42.126
Groot!

17:42.128 --> 17:50.835
Groot!

17:50.837 --> 17:55.106
Gamora: Now!
Before he recovers!

17:55.108 --> 17:56.774
Sorry, avenger.
Nothing personal,

17:56.776 --> 18:05.516
But I gotta put you
in deep freeze.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.452
That's cold!

18:07.454 --> 18:13.825
(hulk roars)

18:13.827 --> 18:15.193
Star-lord, listen to me!

18:15.195 --> 18:16.794
We have to
let this play out.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.429
Whatever the consequences.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.730
Star-lord:
The consequences
are clear!

18:19.732 --> 18:21.732
This planet's
gonna be toast!

18:21.734 --> 18:24.368
Iron man has a plan.
Trust me!

18:24.370 --> 18:28.372
Trust you?
And your misguided faith
in your former teammate?

18:28.374 --> 18:38.416
That kind of trust
doesn't exist!

18:38.418 --> 18:50.862
That kind of trust
doesn't exist!

18:50.864 --> 18:52.830
Gamora: This is
when he is at
his most vulnerable.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.133
The time to attack
is now!

18:55.135 --> 19:01.806
Gamora, wait!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.808
Too much power!

19:03.810 --> 19:06.344
Too much to consume!

19:06.346 --> 19:07.879
The machine's overloading!

19:07.881 --> 19:10.915
There's way more energy than
just the surface life-forms.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.317
Greater than even
the insatiable appetite

19:13.319 --> 19:14.819
Of galactus can withstand.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.755
Even galactus has limits.
But how?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.790
Drax, scan the planet.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.325
Core temperature rising.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.794
Seismic activity, radiation...
Off the charts!

19:23.796 --> 19:26.797
Rocket raccoon:
This planet was already
going to explode.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.833
And not
because of galactus.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.903
Herald! Help me!

19:31.905 --> 19:34.772
Galactus must feed.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.908
What have you done?

19:36.910 --> 19:39.410
You required
a life-rich planet.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.480
Thanks to the power cosmic,
I found one.

19:42.482 --> 19:45.316
With an unstable
uranium core.

19:45.318 --> 19:48.452
Did your loyal servant
neglect to inform you?

19:48.454 --> 19:56.928
Clearly, I am
no longer worthy
to be your herald.

19:56.930 --> 20:07.171
Can we go now?

20:07.173 --> 20:17.315
Can we go now?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.450
Hawkeye: Huh.
Guess he's
sleeping one off.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.320
Hulk: How long before
he wakes up?

20:22.322 --> 20:26.691
Iron man: Long enough for
us to put a real plan
in place on earth.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.860
You know, that power cosmic
is a heck of a thing.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.330
It allowed me to find
an unstable planet

20:32.332 --> 20:34.632
That was on
its way out anyway.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.401
Even the d'bari didn't know
their home was going to blow.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.770
Galactus showing up
got them to evacuate.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.806
And you felt it
unimportant

20:41.808 --> 20:44.742
To let us know
of this grand plan?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.445
Tough to clue you in when
I was hyper-communicating

20:47.447 --> 20:49.814
With a being older
than the universe itself.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.883
And besides, I didn't want
to risk him finding out.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.685
And what of the d'bari?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.954
Star-lord: We've
already located
a new homeworld.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.257
One that won't blow up.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.726
Sorry for
the misunderstanding.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.761
I hope our teams
cross paths again.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.964
I've no doubt,
though I'm still not sure
about your tactics.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.532
What tactics?

21:08.534 --> 21:10.801
With all that bickering
and countermanding each other,

21:10.803 --> 21:13.404
It's a wonder they
function as a team at all.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.772
It all comes down
to one word.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.840
"tony?"

21:15.842 --> 21:15.840
"trust."

21:15.842 --> 21:25.549
(sighs)
just be glad you don't
have to live with him.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.618
I am groot.
