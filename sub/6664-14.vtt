00:00.300 --> 00:03.102
Adult adam:
Ferris bueller's day off.

00:03.104 --> 00:03.802
<i> The epic '80s teen movie</i>

00:03.804 --> 00:06.705
<i> By the epic '80s</i>
<i> teen movie director,</i>
<i> john hughes.</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:09.641
<i> Ferris was effortlessly</i>
<i> cool, confident</i>

00:09.643 --> 00:10.209
<i> And charismatic,</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:12.411
<i> And every teenage boy</i>
<i> wanted to be him,</i>

00:12.413 --> 00:14.179
<i> Especially me and barry.</i>

00:14.181 --> 00:15.814
Barry and adam with tv:
You're abe froman?

00:15.816 --> 00:17.616
That's right.
I'm abe froman.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.319
The sausage king
of chicago?

00:20.321 --> 00:23.088
Yeah. That's me.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.990
(both chuckling)
oh my god.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.058
Ferris is so awesome.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.227
One day, I'm gonna eat
in a fancy restaurant.

00:28.229 --> 00:32.264
And one day, I'm
gonna be able to
pull off this beret,

00:32.266 --> 00:33.332
Just like ferris.
Never!

00:33.334 --> 00:35.467
Only I can pull that off!
Give me mom's beret!

00:35.469 --> 00:37.302
Adult adam: <i> Yep,</i>
<i> we constantly fought about</i>

00:37.304 --> 00:39.304
<i> Which one of us</i>
<i> was most like ferris.</i>

00:39.306 --> 00:40.806
Are you kidding me
right now?

00:40.808 --> 00:43.776
In what world
are you the ferris?
Barry: Duh.

00:43.778 --> 00:46.412
We're both cool,
we both date
hot ladies,

00:46.414 --> 00:48.180
And we both have
horrible sisters.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.215
All of that applies
to me, too.

00:50.217 --> 00:50.916
(scoffs) if anything,

00:50.918 --> 00:54.053
You're the sickly,
goober best friend,
cameron.

00:54.055 --> 00:54.453
Me?

00:54.455 --> 00:57.523
You're the emotional wreck
who wears a hockey jersey
all the time.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.991
That's classic
cameron, dude.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.293
Don't you dare call me
"the cameron", cameron!

01:01.295 --> 01:04.363
I'm ferris, bro.
Deal with it.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.065
Deal with this.

01:06.067 --> 01:06.632
(toilet flushes)

01:06.634 --> 01:07.699
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

01:07.701 --> 01:10.035
Adult adam:
<i> But in reality,</i>
<i> I wasn't ferris.</i>

01:10.037 --> 01:10.669
<i> I was this.</i>

01:10.671 --> 01:13.005
Hey, guys! Want to
be in the school's
video time capsule?

01:13.007 --> 01:14.740
It'll be a learning tool
for future generations.

01:14.742 --> 01:18.043
Yeah, you're
a learning tool
for all generations.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.244
(all laughing)
good one.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.479
Dude, enough
with the camera.

01:20.481 --> 01:25.617
It's creepy and
intrusive and weird.
Just like you.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.687
Thank you
for the feedback.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.223
Adult adam:
<i> While I knew</i>

01:31.225 --> 01:32.424
<i> I was miles from ferris,</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:35.961
<i> Barry lived in</i>
<i> a straight up fantasyland.</i>

01:35.963 --> 01:37.830
'sup, math club?

01:37.832 --> 01:39.832
Calcu-later!

01:39.834 --> 01:42.835
'sup, band geeks?
Staying out of treble?

01:42.837 --> 01:44.336
I have no idea
who you are.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.805
Hey, lover girl!
How ya been?

01:46.807 --> 01:49.875
Awful. I just got voted
onto the homecoming court.

01:49.877 --> 01:50.342
We made it?

01:50.344 --> 01:53.445
Yes! I'm gonna
need a big crown,
you know,

01:53.447 --> 01:54.613
'cause I have
a huge head.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.583
Oh, wow.
You really, um,
misread that badly.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.518
You lost,
like, big-time.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.987
Anthony balsamo won
in a landslide.

02:01.989 --> 02:02.888
Barry: Wait.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.323
You and your
dreamy ex-boyfriend

02:04.325 --> 02:06.692
Are sharing a float
in the parade?

02:06.694 --> 02:07.326
Together?

02:07.328 --> 02:10.262
That's the most
romantic of all modes
of transportation!

02:10.264 --> 02:12.498
Chill! We were
a disaster when
we dated.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.199
We never talked.
All we did was make out.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.335
This is not
getting better!
Erica: Um...

02:16.337 --> 02:17.636
You're on
the homecoming court?

02:17.638 --> 02:20.205
I thought we agreed
it was for stupid,
lame losers.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.674
(scoffs) it's totally
for stupid, lame losers.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.575
Then why
are you doing it?

02:23.577 --> 02:25.911
I wanted to
be a part of it.
Yeah, well, so do I!

02:25.913 --> 02:29.081
But you're not
supposed to admit it.
So... Are we...

02:29.083 --> 02:30.849
Still sure that
I didn't win?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.251
Both: Yes!
All right.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.986
I'm gonna go help
make the float.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.788
So lame and fun.
(squeals)

02:36.790 --> 02:38.056
Ugh!

02:38.058 --> 02:39.057
This sucks!

02:39.059 --> 02:41.560
I can't compete
with anthony balsamo.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.294
He's a dreamboat.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.762
Well, if it makes
you feel better,
you and lainey

02:43.764 --> 02:45.430
Lasted way longer
than I thought.
Well...

02:45.432 --> 02:50.736
I'm gonna be even
more dreamboatier
than anthony balsamo.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.337
I'm gonna be...

02:52.339 --> 02:54.173
Ferris bueller.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.607
It's time I have
an epic day off.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.910
Good luck, knob.
Mom will catch you
in 2 seconds.

02:57.912 --> 03:02.915
Spoken like ferris'
shockingly unlikable
sister, jennifer grey.

03:02.917 --> 03:03.982
I want out
of this family.

03:03.984 --> 03:07.886
That's literally something
jennifer grey says.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.989
<i> (oh yeah</i> by yello playing)
a day off is exactly
what I need

03:10.991 --> 03:12.691
To get my mojo back.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.492
Life moves pretty fast.

03:13.494 --> 03:17.196
If you don't stop
and look around
once in a while,

03:17.198 --> 03:17.763
You could miss it.

03:17.765 --> 03:21.433
(music stops)
again, dude, I don't
know who you are.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.569
I'm ferris bueller!

03:23.571 --> 03:25.871
God! Read a book!

03:25.873 --> 03:27.372
<i> ¶ bow, bow</i>

03:27.374 --> 03:28.707
<i> ¶ chik, chika-chika ¶</i>

03:28.709 --> 03:31.176
Adult adam:
<i> It was April 27,</i>
<i> 1980, something,</i>

03:31.178 --> 03:32.978
<i> And my loving smother</i>
<i> was walking in</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:36.348
<i> On yet another mess</i>
<i> she had to clean up.</i>

03:36.549 --> 03:38.050
I was gone
for 2 minutes!

03:38.052 --> 03:39.918
What the hell
happened in here?

03:39.920 --> 03:40.786
We wanted
milkshakes,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.821
And we couldn't
find the lid
to the blender,

03:42.823 --> 03:44.823
So we just used
barry's hands.

03:44.825 --> 03:45.657
It did not work.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.360
The lid was right here.
You didn't even look for it.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.828
I don't know
why I put up with you. I...

03:49.830 --> 03:52.931
Both: "I could have
been a lawyer."

03:53.066 --> 03:55.234
Adult adam: <i> My mom used</i>
<i> that catchphrase to remind us</i>

03:55.236 --> 03:58.770
<i> Of the imaginary career</i>
<i> she'd given up to raise us.</i>

03:58.772 --> 03:59.671
Shh!

03:59.673 --> 04:00.872
Stop folding
so loudly!

04:00.874 --> 04:02.207
We can't
hear the tv!

04:02.209 --> 04:04.309
You know, I did not
sign up for this.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.210
I could've been a lawyer!

04:05.212 --> 04:08.280
This is the third time
I'm calling you
down for dinner!

04:08.282 --> 04:09.948
Stop ignoring
your mother!

04:09.950 --> 04:11.149
I could've been a lawyer!

04:11.151 --> 04:14.219
You know I could
have been a lawyer?

04:16.122 --> 04:17.623
Don't get fresh.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.091
I've given up everything
for you people.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.660
No offense,
but being a lawyer's
like a whole thing,

04:21.662 --> 04:23.996
And you only went to
one semester of college.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.832
I don't believe this.
I would like nothing more

04:26.834 --> 04:28.700
Than to be out there
in the workforce

04:28.702 --> 04:30.335
With my shoulder padded
power suit

04:30.337 --> 04:32.738
And my thermos
full of homemade soup...

04:32.740 --> 04:36.341
Maybe chicken noodle
or maybe a nice bisque.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.010
Or stew.

04:38.411 --> 04:38.910
Probably stew.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.412
And we're back
to cooking again.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.614
Admit it. You complain
about doing mom stuff,

04:42.616 --> 04:43.749
But you secretly
love it.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.817
I'll have you know
that virginia kremp
has been trying

04:45.819 --> 04:48.120
To get me to work part time
at the flower shop for years,

04:48.122 --> 04:51.089
And I think it's time
I finally take her up on it.

04:51.091 --> 04:51.923
As of tomorrow,

04:51.925 --> 04:55.327
I will officially
start my second job.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.728
What's your first job?

04:56.730 --> 04:57.963
Being a mom!

04:57.965 --> 04:59.631
(chuckling)
unbelievable.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.567
Tomorrow,
I am going to work,

05:02.569 --> 05:04.536
No matter what happens.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.804
How could this happen?

05:05.806 --> 05:09.141
Murray, feel his hands.
They're cold and clammy.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.809
I don't want
to get sick.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.312
(sighs) I'm fine.
I'll get up.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.981
Not a chance, mister.
(sighs)

05:15.983 --> 05:18.250
Don't you worry.
Mama's gonna stay
right here

05:18.252 --> 05:20.285
And nurse you
back to health.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.454
No! I mean...

05:22.456 --> 05:23.155
(softly) no.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.424
Are you seriously
buying this bullcrap?

05:25.426 --> 05:27.526
I mean, he told me
in school
he would do this.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.896
He's faking it
like ferris bueller.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.097
Erica?

05:32.099 --> 05:33.298
Is that you?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.167
Please don't be
upset with me.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.869
You have your health.
Be thankful.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.738
That's literally a line
from the movie!

05:39.740 --> 05:41.807
Please just
watch the movie.
It's all in the movie.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.676
We don't have
time to watch
movies right now.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.178
Clearly, your
brother is very sick

05:46.180 --> 05:47.713
And needs
his rest.
(mouthing)

05:47.715 --> 05:51.183
Now go eat breakfast
and get to school. Move!

05:51.185 --> 05:51.783
(erica scoffs)

05:51.785 --> 05:54.453
Bevy, it's your
first day of work.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.588
I'm not gonna
let the moron ruin it.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.090
I'll stay with him,
okay?

05:58.092 --> 05:59.491
But he needs
constant care.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.127
All you'll do
is loaf around
in your chair,

06:02.129 --> 06:03.495
Watch hours
of television,

06:03.497 --> 06:04.529
And eat whatever
you want.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.933
Adult adam:
<i> In that moment, my dad</i>
<i> realized my mom was right.</i>

06:07.935 --> 06:10.569
<i> This could be</i>
<i> his day off, too.</i>

06:10.571 --> 06:12.337
I'm incredibly offended.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.005
Just to prove
you wrong,

06:14.007 --> 06:16.041
I will stay with
barry all day!

06:16.043 --> 06:20.312
Oh, feel better,
but don't stop
needing me!

06:22.482 --> 06:23.949
(groans)

06:23.951 --> 06:25.517
<i> (oh yeah</i> playing)
they bought it.

06:25.519 --> 06:29.388
The key to faking out
the parents is
the clammy hands.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.122
You fake
a stomach cramp,

06:30.124 --> 06:33.258
And when you're
bent over moaning,
you lick your palms.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.861
It's a little childish,
but hey...
(music stops)

06:35.863 --> 06:37.729
Stop!
I told you, man...

06:37.731 --> 06:39.164
Stop touching
my camera!

06:39.166 --> 06:40.198
You're not ferris!

06:40.200 --> 06:44.302
Adult adam:
<i> Now all barry had to do</i>
<i> was outsmart my old man.</i>

06:44.570 --> 06:44.936
Later.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.772
Have fun with
your thing, erica.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.074
Adult adam: <i> That part</i>
<i> was beyond easy.</i>

06:49.076 --> 06:52.144
<i> Next, barry headed over</i>
<i> to pops' retirement community</i>

06:52.146 --> 06:54.846
<i> To pick up some</i>
<i> sweet wheels.</i>
Hey.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.783
How you doin'?
Barry goldberg.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.752
Give me your firebird.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.921
Okay.
Wow. I...

07:02.923 --> 07:04.022
(chuckles)
didn't expect that.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.958
Okay.
Thing is, is I'm
skipping school,

07:06.960 --> 07:07.726
And you can't
tell anyone.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.594
That may be
a little difficult.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.929
I'm taking
the day off, too.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.798
What? You're
stealing my thing!

07:12.800 --> 07:15.400
Your thing?
I'm the one that
needs the day off.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.169
You're a dumb kid!
Your problems
are meaningless.

07:17.171 --> 07:21.072
It's been brought
to my attention
that my whole being

07:21.074 --> 07:23.108
Might not be
well-received
at school.

07:23.110 --> 07:23.809
Just like cameron.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.111
Admit it.
Admit you're
the cameron.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.314
My leopard vest
and boyish charm
say otherwise.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.149
That's my look!
I'm ferris!

07:31.151 --> 07:33.084
Enough!
I'll be the camden.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.253
The two of you
can be the fergus.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.755
Does that mean
you'll help us?

07:36.757 --> 07:39.391
Normally, I wouldn't let
you kids skip school,

07:39.393 --> 07:40.892
But let's be honest.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.661
You both need a day off.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.463
Well, then,
let's hit the road.

07:44.465 --> 07:47.199
<i> (oh yeah</i> playing)

07:51.204 --> 07:55.173
If you have the means,
I highly recommend
picking one up.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.275
I did.
It's mine.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.945
(engine starting)
(engine revving)

08:04.584 --> 08:06.318
<i> ¶ bow, bow</i>

08:06.320 --> 08:07.719
<i> ¶ chik, chika-chika ¶</i>

08:07.721 --> 08:10.121
Do you have
a kiss for daddy?

08:10.123 --> 08:12.691
Not now, barry.
I just got a call.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.359
My grandmother
passed.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.194
(chuckling)
that was me!

08:16.196 --> 08:18.196
I called the school
so you could skip.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.499
Wait. So meemaw's
not dead?

08:20.501 --> 08:21.900
No!

08:21.902 --> 08:22.467
I assume not.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.536
I don't have
eyes on her,
but most likely.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.372
Oh, my god.
What is wrong
with you?

08:27.374 --> 08:28.073
It's what ferris does,

08:28.075 --> 08:29.841
And everyone
loves him for it.
Erica: Idiot!

08:29.843 --> 08:31.977
Lainey's grandmother
helped raise her,

08:31.979 --> 08:32.777
And you just
told the school

08:32.779 --> 08:34.713
That she got
flattened by a semi.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.748
Come on.
I need my sloane.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.684
I even got you
a distracting
white fringe jacket.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.854
I can't leave, okay?
It's homecoming.

08:42.856 --> 08:43.722
Plus, I have to
call my aunt

08:43.724 --> 08:46.157
And tell her that
her mother is alive.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.759
(sighs)

08:47.761 --> 08:48.994
You suck at this.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.161
Shut up!

08:50.163 --> 08:51.830
But he's right.
Let's just go home.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.499
No! We got a day off
to have, kiddo.

08:54.501 --> 08:58.336
Wait, you're actually
encouraging them both
to skip school?

08:58.338 --> 09:00.405
Sorry, sweetheart.
They need this.

09:00.407 --> 09:03.542
God, I am so sick
of everyone bending
over backwards

09:03.544 --> 09:06.478
For these two losers,
because they fail at life.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.712
Whatever, jennifer grey.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.047
Have fun in school
while we live it up.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.584
Fine! You want me
to be jennifer grey,
you'll get her.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.420
But not the awesome one
in <i> dirty dancing.</i>
(engine revving)

09:15.422 --> 09:17.022
<i> ¶ chik, chika-chika ¶</i>
(tires squealing)

09:17.024 --> 09:20.525
And that was
my fringe jacket!

09:22.528 --> 09:24.329
Adult adam: <i> After a bit</i>
<i> of a shaky start,</i>

09:24.331 --> 09:26.531
<i> Barry's day off was under way.</i>

09:26.533 --> 09:27.299
<i> With me at his side,</i>

09:27.301 --> 09:30.035
<i> We would take philly by storm</i>
<i> and relive the movie.</i>

09:30.037 --> 09:31.603
<i> First up was the museum.</i>

09:31.605 --> 09:33.572
<i> ¶ oh, yeah</i>

09:34.674 --> 09:36.708
<i> ¶ oh, yeah</i>

09:38.110 --> 09:39.778
<i> ¶ the moon ¶</i>

09:39.780 --> 09:41.713
Where are the boobs?

09:42.248 --> 09:43.949
Where are the boobs?

09:44.150 --> 09:44.883
Where are the boobs?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.619
Adult adam: <i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> trying to re-create</i>
<i> your favorite scene</i>

09:47.621 --> 09:49.421
<i> From a movie isn't</i>
<i> as easy as you'd think.</i>

09:49.423 --> 09:51.957
Just take
my hand!
Stranger danger!

09:51.959 --> 09:52.924
Hey! Come here!
It's from a movie!

09:52.926 --> 09:56.294
Adult adam:
<i> Next up was the phillies,</i>
<i> and it was gonna be legendary.</i>

09:56.296 --> 09:58.897
Hey, batter!
Hey, batter!

09:58.899 --> 10:00.332
Swing, batter!

10:00.334 --> 10:03.234
Hey, butter!
Hey, butter!

10:03.236 --> 10:04.869
Sweet, butter!

10:04.871 --> 10:06.871
Are you saying
"sweet butter"?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.773
Shut up.
I don't know sports.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.008
(bat cracks)
(crowd cheers)

10:10.010 --> 10:13.411
Foul ball!
Look alive, boys!

10:13.413 --> 10:15.313
Yes!
(player thudding)

10:15.315 --> 10:16.615
(crowd booing)

10:16.617 --> 10:18.049
Adult adam:
<i> But, unfortunately for us,</i>

10:18.051 --> 10:22.621
<i> The day was becoming</i>
<i> legendary for all</i>
<i> the wrong reasons.</i>

10:24.557 --> 10:28.326
<i> And we weren't</i>
<i> the only ones</i>
<i> struggling that day.</i>

10:28.328 --> 10:29.594
You okay?
You seem blue.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.830
It's just
barry's sick,
(music stops)

10:31.832 --> 10:34.399
And I feel really
guilty being here.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.168
Aw, honey.
Welcome to being
a working mama.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.237
You want to get out
of that house,
and then when you do,

10:39.239 --> 10:41.740
You can't help
but feel like you're
missing out, right?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.209
Thanks, ginny.
It's nice to know
I'm not alone.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.711
(chuckles)
and here I was,
ready to...

10:46.713 --> 10:49.247
Bail and go
check on him.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.616
(both laughing)

10:51.851 --> 10:53.652
(breathlessly)
come on.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.252
Oh, bev.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.954
No, your family
will still be there

10:55.956 --> 10:57.055
To love you when
you get home.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.491
That means a lot.
(chuckles)

10:59.493 --> 11:00.692
In fact, you've
inspired me.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.128
I think I'm gonna
take the van
(keys jangling)

11:03.130 --> 11:03.828
And do some
deliveries

11:03.830 --> 11:07.032
Or whatever it is
you do with a van.
'kay. Bye.

11:07.034 --> 11:07.966
Wait! You forgot
the flowers!

11:07.968 --> 11:11.136
Adult adam:
<i> As my mom was ditching</i>
<i> the first day of her new job,</i>

11:11.138 --> 11:12.771
<i> We were making</i>
<i> a last-ditch effort</i>

11:12.773 --> 11:15.940
<i> To get a tiny taste</i>
<i> of ferris bueller.</i>

11:17.510 --> 11:19.110
(keys jangling)

11:19.112 --> 11:20.178
Keep it close, pal.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.479
(classical music playing)

11:21.481 --> 11:22.747
Hello. May I help you?

11:22.749 --> 11:24.849
Yes, my good man.
I am abe froman,

11:24.851 --> 11:27.185
The cheesesteak king
of philadelphia.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.522
And I am gabe froman,
the emperor of soft pretzels.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.856
Get out of here!
You're terrible!

11:31.858 --> 11:34.359
Take it easy,
ferguses.
Hmm.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.896
I don't see those
names on my list.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.900
But that's fine. We have
a beautiful table for you
right by the window.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.803
Whoa! Whoa!
You're gonna seat us
just like that?

11:44.805 --> 11:47.472
He just said he's
the pretzel emperor.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.473
That's not
even a thing.

11:48.475 --> 11:52.410
Well, we pride ourselves
on accommodating all
of our guests.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.712
So, if you'll
follow me...

11:53.714 --> 11:56.448
No, sir, I will
not follow you!

11:56.450 --> 11:58.149
Make it difficult
for us to sit.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.551
Yeah! We need
to outsmart you

11:59.553 --> 12:00.618
With our comedic
shenanigans.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.288
I'm sorry. I don't
understand what's
happening right now.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.989
You're supposed
to act snooty

12:04.991 --> 12:06.758
And threaten
to call the police.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.493
I would never
call the police.

12:08.495 --> 12:12.230
Now, if you and
the pretzel emperor
will follow me...

12:12.232 --> 12:14.165
Call the police!
I demand it!

12:14.167 --> 12:14.866
Don't call the police.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.335
Call the police!
Don't call the police.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.971
We'll just get
our car from valet.

12:19.973 --> 12:20.939
We don't have a valet.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.007
Then you better
call the police.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.343
Adult adam: <i> And with</i>
<i> one simple toss of the keys...</i>

12:25.345 --> 12:26.010
Keep it close, pal.

12:26.012 --> 12:29.047
<i> ...Barry was completely</i>
<i> robbed of his day off.</i>

12:29.049 --> 12:30.849
(bell dings)

12:31.383 --> 12:34.486
(triumphant music playing)

12:34.488 --> 12:38.056
Adult adam:
<i> Unlike the movie, the firebird</i>
<i> was never seen again.</i>

12:38.058 --> 12:39.791
(car thudding)
(tires squealing)

12:39.793 --> 12:42.393
<i> Even worse, my mom</i>
<i> was flying home</i>

12:42.395 --> 12:44.662
<i> To give her sick little</i>
<i> schmoopie some tlc.</i>

12:44.664 --> 12:48.233
(car thudding)
beverly: Ow!
I hurt my bottom!

12:48.235 --> 12:49.801
Adult adam: <i> But she</i>
<i> had promised my dad</i>

12:49.803 --> 12:51.336
<i> She wouldn't walk through</i>
<i> that front door...</i>

12:51.338 --> 12:54.973
(snorts)
<i> ...To go see barry before</i>
<i> the workday was done.</i>

12:54.975 --> 12:55.874
(snoring)

12:55.876 --> 12:58.476
<i> So instead, she decided</i>
<i> to climb the trellis</i>

12:58.478 --> 13:01.045
<i> And go through the window.</i>

13:01.514 --> 13:02.747
Ow!

13:02.749 --> 13:04.149
Oh, poop!

13:04.151 --> 13:06.251
Mama's coming, baby.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.419
Oh, it's in my
pantyhose! Damn it!

13:08.421 --> 13:12.690
We are definitely
overwatering this lawn.
My pedicure!

13:12.692 --> 13:14.893
Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:21.567 --> 13:22.934
How's work going?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.603
(door closes)
I told you.
He's fine.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.539
Something's wrong.
He didn't come
to the window.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.275
I've got to get up there
and put my lips
on his forehead.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.477
It's the only way to get
an accurate temperature.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.814
You can't stay
away, can you?
You're crazy.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.917
If stealing a van
and trying to break
into my own home

13:38.919 --> 13:40.952
So I can snuggle
my boy is crazy,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.353
Then I don't want
to be sane.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.022
You stole a van?
No time to explain,

13:44.024 --> 13:45.957
Mostly 'cause it
makes me look bad.

13:45.959 --> 13:46.491
Barry needs me!

13:46.493 --> 13:49.494
Adult adam:
<i> Luckily, my brother had</i>
<i> followed the movie to a "t"</i>

13:49.496 --> 13:52.630
<i> And rigged an elaborate</i>
<i> pulley system to a mannequin</i>

13:52.632 --> 13:54.232
<i> To fake out my mom.</i>

13:54.234 --> 13:56.534
(snoring)

14:00.506 --> 14:03.241
See? The kid's
totally fine.
Really?

14:03.243 --> 14:06.211
Adult adam:
<i> But beverly goldberg</i>
<i> was a lot smarter</i>

14:06.213 --> 14:07.812
<i> Than the mom in the movie.</i>

14:07.814 --> 14:08.913
(snoring)

14:08.915 --> 14:10.615
(telephone ringing)

14:10.617 --> 14:10.982
Hello?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.685
Barry's ditching school.
Beverly: <i> Wow.</i>

14:13.687 --> 14:15.453
Thank you for telling me
nothing of note.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.088
Did you even hear
what I said?

14:17.090 --> 14:19.591
Yes, narc.
I'm also ditching work.

14:19.593 --> 14:20.892
Are you gonna tattle
on me, too?

14:20.894 --> 14:24.662
But I...
Get back to class,
or you're grounded.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.136
What do you mean,
the car's already
been reported stolen?

14:32.138 --> 14:34.772
The question is,
how did you know
it was stolen?

14:34.774 --> 14:38.476
I didn't.
I mean, I did,
because I reported it,

14:38.478 --> 14:40.712
But I didn't really.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.279
I'm gonna go.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.047
No, you're gonna
wait for someone

14:43.049 --> 14:44.782
To come
and question you.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.118
(knuckles cracking)

14:57.029 --> 14:58.496
Drugs?

14:59.164 --> 15:00.665
Thank you, no.
I'm good.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.035
No, I meant are you
in here for drugs?

15:04.037 --> 15:05.303
No.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.071
Why are you here?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.573
Drugs.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.642
So, you gonna tell me
your story or what?

15:10.644 --> 15:11.709
Fine. You want to know
what's wrong?

15:11.711 --> 15:14.512
I know what's wrong.
I just want to
hear you say it.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.981
In a nutshell,
I hate my brothers.

15:16.983 --> 15:17.916
They think
my life is so easy,

15:17.918 --> 15:20.885
But I have problems,
like everyone else.

15:20.887 --> 15:21.386
Like what?

15:21.388 --> 15:22.820
My friend got
on the homecoming court,

15:22.822 --> 15:23.922
And I didn't
go out for it

15:23.924 --> 15:25.723
Because we both
agreed it's stupid.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.091
Well, then,
what's the problem?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.660
I don't know.
I guess, deep down,

15:28.662 --> 15:29.661
I really wanted
to be on it.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.696
Then why didn't
you go for it?

15:31.698 --> 15:32.630
If there's
one thing I know,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.732
Being on
the junior royal court
opens a lot of doors.

15:34.734 --> 15:40.038
'cause it's lame,
and I didn't want people
to make fun of me.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.139
But I guess
that's what I do.

15:41.141 --> 15:45.143
Instead of taking risks,
I just keep my head down.

15:45.145 --> 15:48.279
Maybe that's why
barry bothers
me so much.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.515
He's not afraid
to look like an idiot.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.316
Well, if you ask me,

15:51.318 --> 15:53.318
You ought to spend
more time worrying
about yourself

15:53.320 --> 15:56.187
And less time worrying
about your brother.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.756
All right,
you're free to go.

15:58.758 --> 15:59.357
It's about time.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.694
Feels like I've
been sitting here
for 30 (bleep) years.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.162
<i> ¶ chika-chika</i>
<i> bow, bow ¶</i>

16:04.164 --> 16:05.964
Adult adam: <i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> barry became so depressed</i>

16:05.966 --> 16:10.735
<i> That he'd never be</i>
<i> ferris bueller,</i>
<i> he became catatonic.</i>

16:11.303 --> 16:13.871
Come on.
It's not that bad.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.473
We had a great day.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.407
Barry went comatose,

16:16.409 --> 16:19.877
We got pelted
with garbage
on national tv,

16:19.879 --> 16:21.379
And someone
stole your car.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.516
Enough!
You can't force
a perfect day.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.852
You got to just
go out and live it

16:27.854 --> 16:31.255
The best way
you can as you,
no one else.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.291
That's exactly what
ferris would say.

16:33.293 --> 16:38.696
Great. Even our
80-year-old grandfather
is cooler than us.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.298
Man. Look at the guy.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.433
I think he blew
a microchip.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.302
Pops: You okay, kiddo?

16:44.304 --> 16:46.404
Blink if you can
hear me.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.439
<i> ¶ oh, yeah</i>

16:48.640 --> 16:51.309
<i> ¶ oh, yeah ¶</i>

16:51.311 --> 16:53.111
(music stops)

16:53.113 --> 16:55.246
Did he just...
Yep.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.049
I'm coming,
schmoopie!

16:58.051 --> 16:59.684
Let my body be
your life preserver!

16:59.686 --> 17:04.222
Adult adam: <i> Just like</i>
<i> ferris had been</i>
<i> relentlessly tracked down</i>

17:04.224 --> 17:05.323
<i> By principal rooney,</i>

17:05.325 --> 17:07.792
<i> Barry had been</i>
<i> tracked down by my mom.</i>

17:07.794 --> 17:08.326
(barry gasping)

17:08.328 --> 17:09.861
Beverly:
Hold on to my bosom
and kick with your legs.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.963
Please!
I was about
to hit bottom!

17:11.965 --> 17:14.332
Beverly: Let me breathe
air into your lungs.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.000
Barry: Gross!

17:17.403 --> 17:18.302
Adult adam: <i> It was official.</i>

17:18.304 --> 17:19.637
<i> Barry's day off</i>
<i> was a total failure.</i>

17:19.639 --> 17:23.307
<i> And even worse,</i>
<i> my mom ended up</i>
<i> grounding him for a month.</i>

17:23.309 --> 17:28.479
<i> ¶ when barry was</i>
<i> in egypt's land</i>

17:29.281 --> 17:33.284
<i> ¶ let my barry go ¶</i>

17:34.319 --> 17:36.187
You okay?
I'm dying.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.089
Dude, get up.
It's homecoming.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.590
You got to be there
for lainey.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.526
What's the point?
I'm grounded.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.630
Maybe ferris
can sneak out,
but not me.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.697
Not cameron.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.966
What if I told you
that ferris isn't
even real?

17:48.968 --> 17:50.635
I know.
It's just a movie.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.369
That's not what I mean.

17:51.371 --> 17:55.406
There's this theory
that he's just a figment
of cameron's imagination.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.808
That would make
cameron the hero

17:56.810 --> 17:59.577
And ferris just
the guy he wants to be.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.144
So...

18:00.146 --> 18:04.248
Even if I'm cameron,
I can still be ferris?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.283
Exactly.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.084
Why are you
cheering me up?

18:06.086 --> 18:07.852
I met a dude who
made me take
a good look at myself.

18:07.854 --> 18:11.355
Adult adam:
<i> Just then, my brother</i>
<i> realized erica was right.</i>

18:11.357 --> 18:13.024
<i> Maybe barry was cameron,</i>
<i> but that didn't mean</i>

18:13.026 --> 18:14.859
<i> He didn't have</i>
<i> a little ferris in him, too.</i>

18:14.861 --> 18:17.728
Come on. Let's go
to homecoming.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.063
You said you
were grounded.
Hey,

18:19.065 --> 18:23.468
I'm barry goldberg,
and if anyone can
outsmart mom, it's me.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.336
Later!
Have fun with
your thing, erica.

18:25.338 --> 18:29.207
Adult adam: <i> Once again,</i>
<i> barry had no problem</i>
<i> sneaking past my dad.</i>

18:29.209 --> 18:29.941
Beverly: Squishy...

18:29.943 --> 18:33.511
I know you're grounded,
but that doesn't mean
mama doesn't love you.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.045
(beverly gasps)

18:34.047 --> 18:37.081
Adult adam:
<i> And for 30 seconds, he had</i>
<i> slightly fooled my mom.</i>

18:37.083 --> 18:40.118
(marching band playing)

18:40.619 --> 18:43.321
(crowd cheering)

18:53.265 --> 18:54.632
Boyfriend a no-show,
huh?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.034
Call me old-fashioned,
but a guy who
stands you up

18:57.036 --> 19:00.238
Deserves to get
cheated on.
(chuckles)

19:02.207 --> 19:03.441
(feedback)

19:03.443 --> 19:05.776
<i> (twist and shout</i> playing)

19:06.745 --> 19:08.646
(marching band stops)

19:09.081 --> 19:12.216
<i> ¶ oh, shake it up, baby, now</i>

19:13.118 --> 19:13.885
Oh, no.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.187
<i> ¶ twist and shout</i>

19:16.189 --> 19:19.624
<i> ¶ come on, come on</i>
<i> come on come on, baby, now</i>

19:20.125 --> 19:23.594
<i> ¶ come on</i>
<i> and work it on out</i>

19:24.730 --> 19:27.865
<i> ¶ well, work it on out, honey</i>

19:27.867 --> 19:30.268
<i> ¶ you know you look so good</i>

19:30.270 --> 19:31.636
This isn't what I meant,
you dope!

19:31.638 --> 19:34.839
<i> ¶ you know</i>
<i> you got me going now</i>

19:34.841 --> 19:35.606
<i> ¶ just like I knew</i>

19:35.608 --> 19:37.141
Adult adam: <i> Even though</i>
<i> barry was making</i>
<i> a fool of himself,</i>

19:37.143 --> 19:39.210
(cheers and applause)
<i> something happened</i>
<i> he never expected.</i>

19:39.212 --> 19:44.215
<i> Every single person</i>
<i> in that audience</i>
<i> loved ferris bueller, too.</i>

19:50.455 --> 19:52.256
Uh, who is
that crazy dude?

19:52.258 --> 19:54.725
That's my boyfriend.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.061
<i> ¶ ahhhhh</i>

19:57.063 --> 19:59.430
<i> ¶ ahhhhh</i>
he's doing it.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.432
He's actually
doing it.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.900
<i> ¶ ahhhhh</i>

20:02.902 --> 20:05.503
<i> ¶ ahhhhhhhhhh</i>

20:05.505 --> 20:08.739
I'll go
get him.
No. Let him go.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.108
Sometimes moms
need to know when
to take a day off, too.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.178
<i> ¶ come on, come on, come on</i>
<i> come on, baby, now ¶</i>
sing, baby, sing!

20:14.180 --> 20:15.313
Adult adam: <i> That's when</i>
<i> my mom realized</i>

20:15.315 --> 20:16.814
<i> There was a reason</i>
<i> she wasn't a lawyer.</i>

20:16.816 --> 20:20.751
<i> She already had</i>
<i> the best job in the world.</i>

20:20.753 --> 20:21.485
<i> As for me, I realized</i>

20:21.487 --> 20:26.824
<i> I didn't want to be</i>
<i> ferris bueller or cameron</i>
<i> or anyone else in the movie.</i>

20:26.826 --> 20:27.825
<i> I wanted to be the guy</i>

20:27.827 --> 20:30.795
<i> Who sat behind</i>
<i> the camera, making it.</i>

20:30.797 --> 20:33.464
<i> I wanted to be john hughes.</i>

20:33.466 --> 20:35.333
<i> ¶ shake it, shake it,</i>
<i> shake it, baby, now</i>

20:35.335 --> 20:37.902
Adult adam: <i> Of course,</i>
<i> no one could be,</i>

20:37.904 --> 20:40.104
<i> But I might as damn well try.</i>

20:40.106 --> 20:42.139
<i> ¶ ahhhhh</i>

20:42.141 --> 20:43.741
<i> ¶ ahhhhh</i>

20:43.743 --> 20:45.142
<i> ¶ ahhhhh</i>

20:45.144 --> 20:47.511
<i> ¶ ahhhhh</i>

20:47.513 --> 20:51.249
<i> ¶ ahhhhhhhhhh</i>

20:51.251 --> 20:52.283
(crowd applauding)
whoo!

20:52.285 --> 20:55.219
Adult adam:
<i> That's the thing about</i>
<i> the movies we grow up with...</i>

20:55.221 --> 20:57.488
<i> We always wish we could</i>
<i> be part of the fantasy,</i>

20:57.490 --> 21:02.426
<i> And for one brief moment,</i>
<i> my brother actually was.</i>

21:09.401 --> 21:11.369
You're still here?

21:11.371 --> 21:14.138
(chuckling)
it's over. Go.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.807
Go home.
Get out of here.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.278
I don't get
why I'm doing this.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.514
Trust me. This will make
you famous one day.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.818
That's it. Go home.
Get out of here.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.021
You're done. Goodbye.
