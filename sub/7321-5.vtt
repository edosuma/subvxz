00:01.234 --> 00:02.997
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

00:03.036 --> 00:05.095
- I passed?
- You're not an intern anymore.

00:05.138 --> 00:06.537
George doesn't know I exist.

00:06.573 --> 00:09.235
- Want to go on a date with me?
- What if I'm not into it?

00:09.275 --> 00:11.709
- I won't let you do this to me.
- I know I'm being an ass.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.337
I found a way to save lives.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.211
I could find patients
for a clinical trial.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.079
Tumor's shrinking, the virus is working.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.812
- You keep a diary?
- It's not mine.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.251
- Whose is it?
- Your mother's.

00:23.857 --> 00:28.590
<i>"I am a rock, I am an island."</i>

00:28.628 --> 00:32.792
<i>That's the mantra of pretty much</i>
<i>every surgeon I've ever met.</i>

00:33.900 --> 00:37.927
<i>We like to think we're independent.</i>
<i>Loners. Mavericks.</i>

00:37.971 --> 00:41.634
<i>That all we need to do ourjob is</i>
<i>an OR, a scalpel and a willing body.</i>

00:41.674 --> 00:43.767
Is Yang on call tonight?

00:43.810 --> 00:46.244
Yeah, why do you think
it's so clean in here?

00:46.780 --> 00:50.307
<i>But the truth is, not even</i>
<i>the best of us can do it alone.</i>

00:50.350 --> 00:52.750
<i>Surgery, like life, is a team sport.</i>

00:52.786 --> 00:56.187
Can I just say,
the whole "taking it slow" thing?

00:56.756 --> 00:58.053
Best idea ever.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.357
- It really takes the pressure off.
- Mm...

01:01.628 --> 01:04.221
Yeah, we can just... hang out
without all the...

01:04.263 --> 01:05.993
The expectations.

01:06.032 --> 01:09.092
- Why rush things?
- Exactly.

01:09.135 --> 01:12.627
<i>And eventually you've got</i>
<i>to get off the bench and decide...</i>

01:15.508 --> 01:17.533
<i>...what team are you batting for?</i>

01:31.057 --> 01:32.524
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:33.793 --> 01:37.229
One of the joys of co-habitation
is having breakfast together.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.663
I can't because
Bailey paged us in early.

01:39.699 --> 01:43.328
Guess you don't have time to look
at our work in a major medical journal.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.963
They published
our clinical trial?

01:46.005 --> 01:50.101
It's on the cover. "A new method in
treating inoperable malignant gliomas.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.304
The Shepherd Method."

01:52.345 --> 01:55.576
- What do you think?
- It's a picture, a big picture of you.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.584
- You're making a face.
- I'm not making a face.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.348
I love that picture. I have to go.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.583
The Shepherd Method.

02:04.624 --> 02:08.151
It's about time this hospital
got some good publicity for a change.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.252
- I heard you found a donor.
- Yes, sir.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.787
Last piece of the puzzle
fell into place.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.629
This is the day, Dr. Bailey,

02:14.667 --> 02:17.192
the day that Seattle Grace
comes back swinging.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.705
Shepherd on the front page
of a national journal,

02:19.739 --> 02:21.832
bragging rights to a flashy surgery.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.867
I don't see Mercy West taking on
a project of this magnitude, do you?

02:24.911 --> 02:28.142
I'd rather wait to celebrate
till we pull this thing off.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.615
Good call. We don't want to jinx it.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.280
Eat that, Mercy West.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.294
God, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.321
I had an early morning palatoplasty.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.893
- See this? The Shepherd Method?
- Yeah, impressive. Listen,

02:49.936 --> 02:51.198
last night Erica...

02:51.237 --> 02:54.695
Think they airbrush these pictures?
The man does not have one pore.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.902
Could you focus? I need you right now.

02:56.943 --> 03:00.709
I'm a little exhausted, but if you
want to hop on and do all the work...

03:00.747 --> 03:04.547
No. I need to talk.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.553
Last night, Erica and I...

03:08.121 --> 03:09.418
...we...

03:10.690 --> 03:12.590
We did it. Sort of.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.822
- Congratulations.
- No. No, no.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.057
It was not good, at all.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.655
I choked.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.760
I... couldn't go down there.

03:22.802 --> 03:27.637
I tried, but it just felt so weird
and clinical, like gynie rotation.

03:29.342 --> 03:33.335
I left this morning before
she got up. I couldn't even face her.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.314
What if... What if me and Erica,
what if we are a mistake?

03:36.349 --> 03:38.749
- Where are you going?
- I can't talk about this.

03:38.785 --> 03:42.346
Come on! You love talking about
this stuff. Girl on girl, it's hot.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.152
Two girls getting nasty
and loving it? That's hot.

03:45.191 --> 03:49.389
One girl talking about how much
it sucked? Depressing, and wrong.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.953
Just wrong.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.664
The chief wants us to give George
one of our interns?

03:56.703 --> 03:59.536
Except for Grey. She already lost
O'Malley. Dump your dead weight.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.939
They're all dead weight.
That's why I need all four, not three.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.518
George is filling out paperwork,
getting his real-life doctor wings.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.077
Now would be a good time
to decorate his locker.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.714
- Give me that coffee.
- I don't want the credit,

04:17.757 --> 04:21.055
but the clinical trial was my idea.
I had to beg him to do it.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.722
It's OK you want the credit. I would.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.459
Screw the attendings, you get screwed.
They have the power.

04:26.499 --> 04:27.864
You could screw interns.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.227
I mean, date.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.639
Residents could date interns
'cause we're non-threatening.

04:35.675 --> 04:39.509
I read this study once, interns hardly
ever file sexual harassment claims

04:39.545 --> 04:43.174
because we feel so weak and powerless
in the hospital environment.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.747
the other white meat.

04:50.556 --> 04:53.081
- Where are we going?
- You'll see when we get there.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.991
I'm on Dr. Sloan's service today.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.656
Everyone's off their services.
You're all with me.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.222
- Where are we going?
- You'll see when we get there.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.359
See your locker? I put a smelly candle.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.927
Your scrubs are gonna smell
like cinnamon bun.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.701
Dr. Sloan is doing a
transpalatal advancement.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.300
Hahn said I could scrub in
on her aortic bypass.

05:10.343 --> 05:13.506
I need to get to the clinic.
I'm the only doctor on call.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.309
I've got administrative work...

05:15.348 --> 05:18.943
Today is not about you. It is not about
whose services you wish to be on,

05:18.985 --> 05:20.475
it's not about your career.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.286
This is about me. This is a project
I've been working on for a long time,

05:24.324 --> 05:28.158
and it's very important to me, therefore
it will be important to you.

05:28.194 --> 05:31.891
The only way we can pull this thing
off is if we work together as a team.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.559
So today you are not
15 individual doctors,

05:34.600 --> 05:37.831
you are one team of surgeons
representing this hospital.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.929
Is everybody clear on that?

05:42.742 --> 05:46.234
Why would they need
so many doctors for one surgery?

05:46.279 --> 05:49.544
Because it's not just one
surgery, it's 12 surgeries.

05:49.582 --> 05:54.747
Six kidney transplants in six ORs,
all at the same time.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.883
Paired matching kidney donation.

05:57.924 --> 06:02.156
It's a six-way swap. Six people
donate kidneys to total strangers,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.720
six people get kidneys
from total strangers.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.028
Twelve people walk away happy.

06:07.066 --> 06:10.092
- Paired matching kidney donations.
- Otherwise known as...

06:10.136 --> 06:11.194
A domino surgery.

06:26.719 --> 06:31.418
Stan Mercer, 46. Chronic renal failure
secondary to high blood pressure.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.915
His wife wanted to donate a kidney
to him but she wasn't a match,

06:34.961 --> 06:38.397
so she will be donating her kidney
to Ms. Chen over there,

06:38.431 --> 06:43.528
who is a match, while Mr. Mercer will be
getting a kidney from this young man.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.400
Nice to meet you.

06:47.273 --> 06:48.865
PJ.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.035
Please.

06:51.411 --> 06:56.110
Kurt Walling, 58. Chronic renal failure
secondary to diabetes.

06:56.149 --> 07:01.018
His son PJ wasn't a match, so Mr.
Walling will get Ms. Herman's kidney.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.715
- Thanks for the kidney, Ms. Herman.
- Call me Lindsay.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.747
We'll be pretty close
by the end of the day.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.760
And so on.
Why do you still look stupid?

07:07.794 --> 07:09.728
Maybe if we had a cheat sheet.

07:09.762 --> 07:13.698
Ms. Herman gives her kidney to Mr.
Walling. His son's kidney to Mr. Mercer.

07:13.733 --> 07:17.533
Mr. Mercer's wife gives hers to Ms.
Chen. Chen's sister gives her kidney

07:17.570 --> 07:20.937
to Mr. Patel. Mr. Patel's wife
gives her kidney to Ms. Loring,

07:20.973 --> 07:23.942
who came in with her cousin Ms. Gomez,
who's giving her kidney to Mr. Cross,

07:23.976 --> 07:25.443
the professional flautist.

07:25.478 --> 07:29.244
For those without a photographic memory,
it's on a board in the conference room.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.274
Why do we have to do
all six transplants at one time?

07:32.318 --> 07:34.286
So no one backs out at the last minute.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.754
Why would they?
It's an incredible thing to be part of.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.780
Passing the organ's kinda creepy.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.487
That's why this whole surgery
is a house of cards.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.757
If we lose one donor, we lose them all.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.822
So you will not only provide
excellent medical care,

07:46.866 --> 07:50.700
but keep your patients happy. We need
to make sure this doesn't fall apart

07:50.736 --> 07:52.670
before the surgery. Any questions?

07:52.705 --> 07:55.105
I heard when they did the domino
at Boston Gen

07:55.141 --> 07:58.508
the residents got to keep one of the
dead kidneys in a jar as a souvenir.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.671
- I want a kidney.
- Can I have a kidney?

08:00.713 --> 08:03.614
- If they get kidneys, I get a kidney.
- I asked first.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.947
No one is taking home a kidney in a jar.

08:05.985 --> 08:10.046
Diseased kidneys are not tchotchkes
for your coffee table. Now go, go.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.655
- Hey, you OK?
- Uh...

08:19.699 --> 08:22.691
Bailey snagged all the surgical
residents and interns

08:22.735 --> 08:25.863
so I'm stuck with the psych interns.
Not the sharpest.

08:25.905 --> 08:29.807
You're busy. I'll be brief. I was
thinking if you weren't on call tonight

08:29.842 --> 08:34.745
that maybe we could go to my place,
order in dinner, rent a movie.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.145
Tonight? You want to
get together again tonight?

08:38.183 --> 08:41.620
- Well, I had a lot of fun last night.
- Fun.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.554
Anyway, just let me know.

08:45.925 --> 08:48.860
OK, as you may know, one of you
is going to O'Malley today.

08:48.895 --> 08:52.490
- Me! I'll go, if you need a volunteer.
- I decide who gets to go

08:52.532 --> 08:55.023
after I decide which one of you
sucks the most.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.900
You better not suck on
purpose because I will know.

08:57.937 --> 09:01.566
Would you like your book or some music,
something to help you relax?

09:01.607 --> 09:04.474
- Maybe some water.
- How about some ice chips instead?

09:04.510 --> 09:06.239
Your ankles are looking thick.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.713
My wife loves tracking
my fluid retention.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.749
And Megan, will you please
come over here and tape the needle

09:14.787 --> 09:18.518
- so we can start dialysis.
- Sounds just like a real doctor.

09:21.794 --> 09:25.594
It says here that you don't have
a loved one in the domino, Ms. Herman.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.191
- No.
- So you're just donating a kidney

09:28.234 --> 09:31.533
- to a complete stranger for nothing?
- It's really no big deal.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.369
I have two kidneys and they say
you can live with one.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.104
That's amazing what you're doing.
UNOS is always short on organs.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.944
- If everyone in the world did this...
- It'd be all peace, love and unicorns.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.882
- She gets it, Grey.
- I'm so sick of all the "yay, you."

09:45.651 --> 09:47.209
I totally understand.

09:52.992 --> 09:56.086
The chief has got me doing press
all day with journalists.

09:56.128 --> 09:59.256
- My face is hurting from smiling.
- I already pushed that.

09:59.298 --> 10:02.165
- Comes faster when I push it.
- Oh, that Shepherd Method.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.566
Funny.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.002
I'll take the stairs.

10:05.037 --> 10:08.438
- Are you bothered by this?
- Why would I be bothered?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.840
You can't call it
the Shepherd-Grey Method

10:10.876 --> 10:13.470
because then people
would think you had help.

10:14.814 --> 10:17.146
I have to give my kidney
to that old guy?

10:17.183 --> 10:20.050
- Mr. Mercer couldn't be more than 50.
- My son's 22.

10:20.086 --> 10:23.249
To him, everyone over 40's
on the brink of death.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.780
- I turned 23 in August.
- That's right.

10:25.825 --> 10:29.158
Maybe we could have a little
belated party here in the hospital.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.720
We'll get an ice cream cake,
you used to love those.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.493
Yeah, when I was seven.

10:33.532 --> 10:37.593
I'm not here for a reunion. I want
to get this over with and get out.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.800
So you are on dialysis
four times a week now?

10:40.840 --> 10:43.832
They might as well chain me
to the machine at this point.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.845
My kidneys are shot.
I'm living on borrowed time.

10:46.879 --> 10:50.212
So I'm pretty lucky to have a son
who would do this for me.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.978
You're lucky you're loaded.

10:52.018 --> 10:55.146
When do I get the 10,000 bucks,
before or after the surgery?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.920
It's a Christmas gift.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.352
It's October.

11:08.768 --> 11:12.966
<i>Dr. Bradford,</i>
<i>labor and delivery. Labor and delivery.</i>

11:14.607 --> 11:16.438
I see you two hovering.

11:17.243 --> 11:22.146
Hypothetically, say a patient
was paying his son for a kidney,

11:22.181 --> 11:24.945
what exactly would happen?

11:24.984 --> 11:28.852
- Paying money, for a kidney.
- Hypothetically.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.721
Well, as someone who stole
an organ herself not that long ago,

11:35.761 --> 11:38.889
you should know,
what would happen is your patient

11:38.931 --> 11:40.831
would be out of the exchange.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.632
Which means that this person,

11:44.670 --> 11:48.401
since her husband's no longer
getting a kidney, would drop out.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.773
Then they'd drop out,
then they'd drop out,

11:50.810 --> 11:54.109
then the whole thing would fall apart,
that's what'd happen.

11:54.146 --> 11:57.877
So if you both are suggesting
that's what's going on here,

11:57.917 --> 12:00.385
you'd better be damn sure about it.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.555
It's just a gift,
an early stocking stuffer.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.727
Most girls your age,
they're busy shopping.

12:10.763 --> 12:13.561
You're in the hospital
giving a kidney to a stranger.

12:13.599 --> 12:14.759
I'm not such a saint.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.064
Your kidney may not go directly
to my husband,

12:17.103 --> 12:19.663
but you're one of the people
saving his life today.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.366
To me, you're Mother Teresa.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.173
Honey, do you mind running
and getting a wet wash cloth for me?

12:25.211 --> 12:26.576
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

12:27.546 --> 12:30.276
My mother invented
the Grey Method all by herself.

12:30.316 --> 12:34.582
Maybe you should stop reading her diary.
It's gonna make you feel inadequate.

12:34.620 --> 12:38.647
She's dead and in the past
and still outpacing me.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.125
OK, see that intern over there?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.492
- Is he clean?
- Huh? What?

12:43.562 --> 12:46.395
I was thinking what Lexopedia said.
She may be onto something.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.095
- You're gonna sleep with an intern?
- It'd just be scratching the itch.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.604
It's been a long time.

12:52.638 --> 12:54.003
I can't do this.

12:54.039 --> 12:57.133
All these people telling me how
wonderful, selfless and giving I am.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.701
I can't take it anymore,
especially not from her.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.111
- Keep your voice down.
- Did you see her face,

13:02.148 --> 13:05.948
thanking me for saving your life?
Stan, this is crazy.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.146
You promised you'd tell her!

13:08.187 --> 13:10.951
- Mr. Mercer, everything OK?
- I don't feel so good.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.426
Tell her! If the past three years
have meant anything to you,

13:14.460 --> 13:16.792
- you have to tell her!
- Stan?

13:20.966 --> 13:25.096
I'm not an idiot. I know there've been
other women. I've told myself just sex.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.800
It's just... My God, Stan.
She's giving a kidney for you.

13:28.841 --> 13:31.309
That's not sex, it's family.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.471
All right, his cardiac enzymes
and EKG look good.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.311
He had an acute anxiety attack.
I can clear him for surgery.

13:37.349 --> 13:40.318
I do everything for you.
I've given up my entire life

13:40.352 --> 13:43.515
to get you to dialysis,
drive you to the doctors...

13:43.556 --> 13:45.251
I didn't ask you to do any of that.

13:45.291 --> 13:48.454
I can drive a car,
I can pour my own juice.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.328
- I got sick, not elderly.
- Well, don't worry.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.355
I won't do one more thing for you,

13:54.400 --> 13:56.664
and that includes giving a kidney.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.772
Get on the phone with UNOS,
tell them we need a kidney

14:04.810 --> 14:07.973
- that matches Mrs. Mercer's antibodies.
- UNOS is a longshot.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.345
It's the only shot we have. Now go. Now!

14:18.424 --> 14:21.416
She's barely a second-year resident.
I made the virus.

14:21.460 --> 14:25.260
She assisted. When Michael Jordan
scores no one cares about the assist.

14:25.297 --> 14:28.061
- I don't know. Scottie Pippen.
- You know what I mean.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.398
These women, they overthink everything.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.666
Somebody's cranky today.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.004
What's that, "experimental
treatments for cleft palates?"

14:36.642 --> 14:38.906
You're working on your own
clinical trial.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.412
- I'm just doing a little research.
- Mm-hmm.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.677
The very sight of me reminds you

14:43.716 --> 14:47.550
that you've not made one worthwhile
contribution to medical history.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.513
- Get out.
- You should read my article.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.922
It'll enrich your life,
make you a better man.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.892
I'm saving it for the bathroom.

14:56.996 --> 15:01.023
It started as an office thing.
You know, light, fun.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.795
And then one day you wake up

15:02.835 --> 15:06.931
and this older guy
is all you can think about.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.332
You'd do anything for him,
even give a kidney.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.611
Why?

15:17.449 --> 15:19.144
I could save his life, too.

15:19.184 --> 15:24.019
She may be married to him,
but I'm saving his life today too.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.356
So then he'll finally have to choose...

15:30.195 --> 15:31.662
...her or me.

15:35.968 --> 15:39.927
Apparently Erica loved it.
The non-sex sex.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.770
- I think she might want more.
- Happens to me all the time.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.105
I barely remember,
their minds are blown.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.508
That's your sage advice?

15:45.544 --> 15:48.843
I'm a world-class surgeon,
double boarded in plastics and ENT.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.543
I have more meaningful
and worthwhile things to do

15:51.583 --> 15:53.847
- than dispense sex advice.
- Like what?

15:53.886 --> 15:56.320
- Nice.
- Come on. No, Mark.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.721
- I need your help!
- Mm-hmm.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.120
Excuse me.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.464
What is going on?

16:07.499 --> 16:10.798
We're trying to decide which
of our interns to give to George.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.236
In front of us.
They're deciding in front of us,

16:13.272 --> 16:16.503
- like livestock at a state fair.
- I think I'll keep Lexopedia.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.908
- She remembers many things.
- Mm-hmm.

16:18.944 --> 16:22.004
And she bathes, which is much more
than I can say for...

16:22.047 --> 16:25.175
...stinky Two over there.

16:25.217 --> 16:29.620
Well, Graciella charts like crap,
but she can put in a line.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.489
Claire, on the other hand,
nearly castrated a guy with a catheter.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.720
We can hear you.

16:35.761 --> 16:36.853
I might dump Pierce.

16:36.895 --> 16:40.296
- How does he suck?
- I just hate saying the name Pierce.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.527
- Mmm...
- We should revolt.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.230
They'd respect us more
if we didn't participate.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.171
Yeah. You revolt first,

16:48.207 --> 16:50.801
- and I'll follow.
- Have you heard from UNOS?

16:50.843 --> 16:54.040
They're still searching for a match.
So far nothing.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.013
I hope they come through.
My guy needs a kidney.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.208
They all need kidneys.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.241
If Derek needed
a kidney I wouldn't give him one.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.515
He'd say he magically grew it himself.

17:02.554 --> 17:05.045
My guy's been sick
for 15 years.

17:05.089 --> 17:09.220
Can you imagine having your life on hold
like that? Plus he's got a crappy kid.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.162
Hey! Did I say you could put that down?

17:13.898 --> 17:16.867
No, so pick it up.

17:16.902 --> 17:19.996
- Weak. No stamina.
- Yeah, but he takes orders.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.739
True, true.

17:26.345 --> 17:29.576
- Is my husband getting a kidney?
- What about my sister?

17:29.615 --> 17:32.948
If she's not getting a kidney, I am
not giving mine to some stranger.

17:32.985 --> 17:36.421
I will do my best to make sure
everyone gets a kidney today.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.913
I'll update you as soon
as I have information. Please.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.627
Sir, I've got this under control.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.425
I have Grey talking with UNOS...

17:45.464 --> 17:48.297
We're being featured
on the national news.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.393
All eyes are on Seattle Grace.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.201
- Fix this.
- Yes, sir.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.600
I've been poked and prodded
like a lab rat.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.340
All for nothing?

18:01.380 --> 18:04.645
We got to spend time with each other.
That's not nothing.

18:04.683 --> 18:08.119
Oh, now you want to spend time together.

18:08.153 --> 18:12.180
Well, you're about 20 years too late,
so, yeah, nothing.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.123
- PJ.
- Do I still get the $10,000

18:15.160 --> 18:17.958
if the surgery doesn't happen?
If not, I'm out of here.

18:17.996 --> 18:22.365
- I have a life to get back to.
- Please. I need you.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.565
If you could just be patient
a little bit longer.

18:36.381 --> 18:37.848
I was gonna punch that kid.

18:37.883 --> 18:41.216
What kind of a selfish idiot?
His father is sick, really sick,

18:41.253 --> 18:43.153
all he cares about is his money.

18:43.188 --> 18:46.487
The guy must've done something bad
to make the kid so angry.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.015
Maybe he cares about his son

18:48.060 --> 18:50.858
but the moron is too emotionally
stunted to let him.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.955
OK. I'm not...

18:52.998 --> 18:55.125
I'm trying to be... I am.

18:55.167 --> 18:58.432
But this, right here? This...
This is exactly your problem.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.700
You get all wrapped up and involved

19:00.739 --> 19:03.708
and you just... You start caring
about these people.

19:03.742 --> 19:06.210
Your patient in there, he's the moron.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.043
His son's never gonna give him
what he wants. He'll be disappointed.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.209
The sooner he gets that
the sooner you get it, and...

19:14.553 --> 19:17.044
No. Go on, please.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.183
Be a selfish ass. At least
then I know what to expect.

19:20.225 --> 19:25.185
This being a decent guy one second
and total jerk the next is getting old.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.664
So who's it gonna be? Pick one.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.206
O'Malley. What's up, bud?

19:37.709 --> 19:41.201
Hey. Missed you at lunch today.
It was an all-new level of hell.

19:41.246 --> 19:44.875
I was busy doing my own charts.
The interns don't respect me.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.215
I would respect you
if I was your intern.

19:47.252 --> 19:51.052
They don't respect you because they're
not scared of you. Decimate one.

19:51.089 --> 19:53.114
It's not rocket science. Two!

19:55.727 --> 19:58.628
Who's getting Ms. Herman's kidney?

20:00.132 --> 20:02.225
- Uh... I can go check.
- Three.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.668
- Mr. Walling.
- That's right. I totally forgot.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.264
Oh, you forgot.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.775
Like you forgot to do your notes
before rounds?

20:10.809 --> 20:13.607
Or like you forgot to pull the drain
on my post-op SBO?

20:13.645 --> 20:17.274
Or like you forgot to sign all your
dictations so all your charts...

20:17.316 --> 20:19.375
...my charts... are delinquent?

20:19.418 --> 20:21.113
You forgot?

20:21.153 --> 20:24.452
The only thing you can retain
in that pea-sized brain of yours

20:24.489 --> 20:26.252
is what time lunch is.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.550
Grey here is gonna become a surgeon

20:29.595 --> 20:32.291
while you dig ditches
by the side of the road.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.435
It's brutal, but it's effective.

20:43.842 --> 20:46.402
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Do what?

20:46.445 --> 20:50.643
Have this silent fight. I'll write the
editors, have them print a correction.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.149
The Shepherd-Grey Method.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.347
I don't want you to give me credit
'cause you're mad I'm mad.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.948
Give me credit 'cause you think
I worked hard for it and deserve it.

20:58.991 --> 21:02.483
You don't deserve it. You're a baby.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.724
You have the potential to be
a good surgeon, maybe a great one,

21:05.764 --> 21:09.131
but you haven't scratched the surface
on what you need to learn.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.260
It was my idea.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.102
And I hate that picture.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.834
<i>...to thoracic surgery.</i>

21:21.146 --> 21:22.841
UNOS doesn't have a match.

21:30.889 --> 21:32.049
OK.

21:32.157 --> 21:35.718
Uh, we can, um...

21:35.794 --> 21:40.163
We've been stalling, we haven't released
anyone. I can talk to Mrs. Mercer...

21:40.198 --> 21:43.133
You can't do anything
that could be seen as coercion.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.159
- UNOS is very clear.
- But, sir...

21:45.203 --> 21:48.798
The last thing we need is to lose
our status as a transplant center.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.676
Let the patients go home.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.679
It's over.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.603
I've got a CABG in an hour.
Want to get some coffee?

22:20.038 --> 22:21.596
I'm not cut out for this.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.337
- Coffee?
- No, this, the touching and the...

22:26.244 --> 22:29.873
...sex with a girl. I just...
I can't do it. I thought I could, but...

22:29.915 --> 22:32.816
But you did do it. I don't understand.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.049
Oh...

22:39.257 --> 22:41.919
It wasn't good for you.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.299
I still can't believe it.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.202
I got so close.

22:56.241 --> 22:59.870
You'll be high on the transplant list.
Something else will come up.

22:59.911 --> 23:02.311
It's not the kidney I'm upset about.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.314
Oh, your son.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.147
We hadn't spoken in over a year.

23:07.652 --> 23:09.677
It took me months to find him.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.986
This was my chance to get him back.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.252
Right.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.760
I know PJ can be selfish...

23:17.896 --> 23:19.261
...rude.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.495
But it hasn't been easy for him.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.570
His mom died.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.736
I worked late most nights.

23:29.775 --> 23:33.506
- I made a lot of mistakes.
- You can't blame yourself.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.809
Some people are just broken.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.708
I guess you just
try not to care too much

23:40.752 --> 23:42.344
and you can't be disappointed.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.625
These are your discharge papers.

23:58.136 --> 23:59.694
I'm sorry.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.770
I don't know why.

24:06.211 --> 24:07.701
I'm sorry.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.184
I'm so sorry.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.655
It's OK.

24:25.430 --> 24:29.730
Now all you have to do is sign
at the bottom and you're free to go.

24:33.038 --> 24:35.336
You must think I'm a terrible person...

24:36.241 --> 24:37.970
...refusing to give my kidney.

24:38.009 --> 24:42.275
- We're not thinking anything, ma'am.
- He's taken everything.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.942
My love, my pride.

24:45.851 --> 24:49.446
My dignity. It's all gone.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.514
But the one thing that he
doesn't have is the kidney.

24:53.592 --> 24:56.891
And the thought of giving him
that last part of me.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.057
You must think I'm a terrible person.

25:03.101 --> 25:05.228
I'm not allowed to think anything.

25:05.270 --> 25:09.229
There are rules that prevent me
from having an opinion here.

25:09.274 --> 25:12.243
Good rules, rules in place for a reason,

25:12.277 --> 25:17.237
because giving an organ that God
put in your body to someone else

25:17.282 --> 25:20.410
isn't something that you can be
coerced into doing.

25:20.452 --> 25:24.354
It is a big thing.

25:24.389 --> 25:26.584
It is an extraordinary thing.

25:26.625 --> 25:31.358
It's a gift that must be freely given.

25:32.330 --> 25:35.231
And if you were to give it,
and I'm not asking you to,

25:35.267 --> 25:40.569
but if you were to give it,
it's not just for your husband.

25:40.605 --> 25:45.338
It's for five other people,
people that you don't know from Adam.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.691
Our six donors are all anesthetized
and ready to go.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.634
They'll be done first,
followed by the recipients.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.639
Each pair will be color-coded
so as not to confuse them.

26:14.673 --> 26:19.372
This surgery is a hornet's nest, people,
so work quickly but carefully.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.642
Use each other, operate as a team.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.740
Let's go make medical history.

26:27.786 --> 26:30.414
We're lucky as hell that woman
changed her mind.

26:30.455 --> 26:33.117
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

26:45.470 --> 26:49.873
Huh. Now that's what I call
a nice-looking kidney.

26:59.384 --> 27:02.876
Put that on ice and start
flushing in the preservation solution.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.313
You want to do
the honors, Dr. Yang?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.988
Good.

27:40.025 --> 27:41.856
Clamp coming off.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.051
Oh! Oh...

27:45.096 --> 27:48.759
- That's quite a geyser of urine.
- That means we did our job right.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.030
You never get tired
of seeing that.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.564
We're ready for you, Grey.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.470
Walking with the kidney.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.548
Five second rule! Five second rule!

28:14.859 --> 28:17.760
Hold it still.
I'm gonna need more ice.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.094
- And another tie.
- I'll get it.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.759
No. You don't touch anything else.

28:22.801 --> 28:26.168
Someone dropped a damn kidney?!

28:32.544 --> 28:36.241
I know. You don't want to talk about it
anymore. I know you're over it.

28:36.281 --> 28:39.444
- For the love of God!
- Just hear me out.

28:39.884 --> 28:43.513
I like to be good at things, OK?

28:43.555 --> 28:46.854
I do not fail, I do not quit.

28:46.891 --> 28:50.987
I like to be good at things,
and I want to be good at this,

28:51.029 --> 28:53.657
so... I need you.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.324
I need you to show me.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.067
Show you?

29:02.107 --> 29:04.507
Because you didn't publish
a big clinical trial

29:04.542 --> 29:06.442
doesn't mean you're not a genius.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.481
Fine. Take off your pants.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.350
Really? Oh, my God, thank you!

29:15.920 --> 29:19.321
- Thank you so much.
- I'll show you the Sloan Method.

29:19.357 --> 29:22.815
Will never be in a medical journal,
but it should.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.496
Shouldn't it be
pinking up by now?

29:30.535 --> 29:32.435
It's just getting
venous blood.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.165
Let's check the backside again.

29:35.874 --> 29:38.672
I think I see a little pink, maybe.

29:40.011 --> 29:42.036
All right, come on, come on.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.079
All right.

29:46.551 --> 29:47.916
Come on.

29:48.353 --> 29:50.253
Come on, pink up.

29:52.223 --> 29:56.455
Come on, pink up.
Pink up, pink up, pink up.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.386
Come on!

30:03.902 --> 30:06.132
Yes! It looks good.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.832
We have a live kidney.

30:16.915 --> 30:21.284
Oh, come on, I am offering two interns.
Two for the price of one.

30:21.319 --> 30:25.153
- I'll trade you Laura for both of 'em.
- Leo drains pus and likes it.

30:25.190 --> 30:28.853
I dropped an internal organ.
On the floor.

30:30.461 --> 30:33.021
- It happens.
- OK, OK.

30:33.064 --> 30:36.659
Four goes to George.
I get James.

30:36.701 --> 30:39.864
Karev, you get Two. Izzie gets Leo.

30:39.904 --> 30:41.428
What are you people doing?

30:44.008 --> 30:48.001
We were just... deciding which
of our interns to give to George.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.776
Oh, you think
I got to choose my interns,

30:50.815 --> 30:55.377
and I picked you people 'cause
you're all such a surgical dream team?

30:55.420 --> 30:58.355
You, you're lazy. You, whiny.

30:58.389 --> 31:01.256
Butterfingers over there,
downright depressing.

31:01.292 --> 31:04.591
And you, Yang, you,
you're just annoying.

31:04.629 --> 31:06.893
Choosing their own interns.

31:06.931 --> 31:08.262
Wha...

31:10.902 --> 31:12.733
Give me those damn cards.

31:16.241 --> 31:18.937
O'Malley, you have interns.

31:22.847 --> 31:25.281
What is it?

31:28.253 --> 31:31.279
OK, open his fluids, Karev.
Push a gram of Mag.

31:31.322 --> 31:34.450
Do a CBC and electrolytes.
Order a color flow doppler

31:34.492 --> 31:37.154
- and do a full neuro workup.
- Think there's a bleed?

31:37.195 --> 31:39.390
No way
of knowing until we evaluate.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.990
Where's PJ? Where's my son?

31:46.204 --> 31:48.764
Stan had better be dead right now.

31:48.806 --> 31:51.138
He's doing fine.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.972
He hasn't called my room.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.374
He hasn't asked for me.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.476
It's been three years.

32:01.419 --> 32:05.856
I gave a kidney for him
and he still hasn't made a choice.

32:11.396 --> 32:15.127
He hasn't asked about you or called.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.998
I think he's made a choice.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.734
But I gave a kidney for him.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.468
I gave a kidney.

32:28.646 --> 32:29.772
Oh, my God.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.641
Oh, my God!

32:35.186 --> 32:37.017
Oh, my God!

32:42.226 --> 32:45.753
Hey, man, the nurse was supposed to
bring my dinner an hour ago.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.198
- Your dad just had a seizure.
- OK.

32:49.233 --> 32:52.566
- So what does that mean?
- It means something's wrong.

32:52.603 --> 32:56.630
It means he could be dying,
and he doesn't know you give a crap.

32:56.674 --> 32:59.507
Honestly he doesn't know
and maybe you don't, but if you do,

32:59.544 --> 33:02.206
he's dying and you'll be too late.
He's asking for you,

33:02.246 --> 33:05.841
you're gonna be too late, you're gonna
live with it the rest of your life!

33:05.883 --> 33:07.942
You want to live with that? Do you?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.385
Alex!

33:18.096 --> 33:21.327
So tomorrow we'll meet one hour
before pre-rounds.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.163
Dude, that's like 4:00am.

33:23.201 --> 33:26.136
Dr. Stevens never
made us come in before pre-rounds.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.434
Yeah, O'Malley, you gotta chill.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.803
They probably should say Dr. O'Malley.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.043
So those are your interns?
Did you even ask for me?

33:38.082 --> 33:40.448
- What?
- I helped you study.

33:41.452 --> 33:44.478
I helped decorate your stupid locker,

33:44.522 --> 33:48.982
I... And you don't even see it.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.825
You don't see anything.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.631
I am such an idiot...

33:58.603 --> 34:00.571
...and you are a jerk.

34:01.272 --> 34:04.002
You didn't even think to ask for me?

34:08.679 --> 34:10.943
Screw you, Dr. O'Malley.

34:20.358 --> 34:22.918
Mr. Cross, Mr. Patel, Ms. Chen,

34:22.960 --> 34:25.485
Ms. Loring and Mr. Mercer,
they're all stable.

34:25.530 --> 34:28.693
But Mr. Walling,
he has delayed graft function

34:28.733 --> 34:32.464
- and God knows what else.
- The press will be all over this.

34:32.503 --> 34:36.438
I need you available for interviews
and photo ops. Wear your nice scrubs.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.841
Did you hear me? Mr. Walling.
He has a serious complication.

34:39.877 --> 34:44.405
- His electrolytes are off, crits down.
- But you saved five other lives.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.475
That's a pretty good scorecard.
Not perfect, but good.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.624
- I told you, I don't want to see Stan.
- I'm not taking you to see Stan.

35:04.135 --> 35:08.299
Oh, this is her. This is the woman
who gave me her kidney.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.146
You made the family...

35:44.242 --> 35:46.938
- How's she doing?
- I'm keeping a close eye on her,

35:46.978 --> 35:49.071
but so far she's completely stable.

35:51.249 --> 35:52.614
Come with me.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.286
This man is very ill.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.759
Maybe dying.

36:04.996 --> 36:09.228
He's got a perfect, healthy donor kidney
that wasn't dropped on the floor.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.762
There's only so much we can help,

36:14.805 --> 36:17.137
and so much we can hurt.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.906
Forgive yourself.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.517
Visiting hours are over.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.458
It's OK.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.697
Dad.

37:06.090 --> 37:09.856
Your urine output's up 25cc's per hour.
That should make you happy.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.055
My wife would have been happy.

37:13.631 --> 37:16.623
Who's gonna care about
my urine output now?

37:22.340 --> 37:25.002
Well, things are gonna be
a little different.

37:34.986 --> 37:39.013
Dr. Bailey, heard your big surgery
went well today. Congratulations.

37:39.056 --> 37:42.548
The same to you. Must feel good
to see your name in print like that.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.756
It would feel better
if Meredith wasn't so...

37:45.796 --> 37:49.232
She's acting silly about the credit.
She's getting emotional.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.532
That girl worked her ass off for you
and you got all the credit.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.834
I would've gotten the blame
had we failed.

37:54.872 --> 37:57.466
- But you didn't fail.
- I'm an attending,

37:57.508 --> 38:00.602
- she's a second-year resident.
- Who you're living with.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.340
That's not simple, it's messy.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.507
If it were me I'd start with
"Thank you."

38:04.548 --> 38:06.846
You'll be surprised
how far that one goes,

38:06.884 --> 38:10.217
especially with us
silly, emotional women.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.761
- Derek said I was a baby...
- What?

38:18.796 --> 38:21.196
...and that I had a lot to learn.

38:21.232 --> 38:24.224
- Whatever.
- Not "whatever." He's right.

38:24.268 --> 38:27.635
I did drop a kidney. Don't say
"it happens" because it doesn't,

38:27.672 --> 38:30.869
- but I do hate when he's right.
- No, OK, he is not right.

38:30.908 --> 38:34.571
Stop caring so much about what
he thinks. Makes you seem desperate.

38:34.612 --> 38:39.174
- OK, to the one trolling for interns.
- Yeah, I changed my mind.

38:39.216 --> 38:41.446
Interns are weak. I don't want weak.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.750
You know, Burke was a man.

38:48.559 --> 38:49.924
He was a man.

38:53.831 --> 38:57.392
Joe, I think we need another round.

38:59.904 --> 39:02.805
Hey, Joe, how you doing? Excuse me.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.003
There you go.

39:06.043 --> 39:08.011
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

39:08.045 --> 39:11.208
Hey, honey, I bought you roses.
Let me back in the house.

39:13.217 --> 39:15.151
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!

39:15.186 --> 39:17.279
Holy crap,
what the hell is that thing?

39:17.321 --> 39:20.415
That is a kidney in a jar.
How did you get that?

39:20.458 --> 39:24.087
Being an incredibly important,
fancy neurosurgeon has its perks.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.561
Thank you.

39:27.398 --> 39:31.232
I couldn't have done it without you.
Not one surgery, not one patient.

39:33.270 --> 39:36.205
I couldn't have done any of it
without you. Thanks.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.233
Yeah, can you guys go and get this thing
out of here before people freak out?

39:40.277 --> 39:41.676
- OK.
- OK.

39:41.712 --> 39:45.079
- Um... Are you gonna be OK?
- Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.778
- Good night. Good night, Joe.
- Good night.

39:47.818 --> 39:50.582
<i>The thing about</i>
<i>choosing teams in real life,</i>

39:50.621 --> 39:52.851
<i>it's nothing like it used to be</i>
<i>in gym class.</i>

39:57.895 --> 40:01.524
<i>Being first pick can be terrifying.</i>

40:01.565 --> 40:04.591
- Take off your pants.
- Excuse me?

40:04.635 --> 40:08.002
Take off your pants.

40:08.973 --> 40:11.066
We're trying this again.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.210
<i>And being chosen last...</i>

40:23.988 --> 40:26.081
<i>...isn't the worst thing in the world.</i>

40:26.123 --> 40:27.283
What?

40:28.926 --> 40:30.188
I care about you.

40:31.996 --> 40:35.693
I care about you,
and I'm not gonna go crazy,

40:35.733 --> 40:37.701
and I'm not gonna try to kill myself.

40:37.735 --> 40:41.933
And I'm not gonna stop caring about you
no matter how hard you push me away.

40:42.907 --> 40:45.842
- Shut up and get out of my room.
- No.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.439
I care about you...

40:48.779 --> 40:52.545
...and I know you care about me, too,
and it's not too late for us.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.710
- Get out of my room.
- Admit it.

40:54.752 --> 40:58.244
Admit that you care about me, too.
I know you do.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.317
And I care about you.

41:02.092 --> 41:04.117
I care about you.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.591
I care about you. I care about you.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.724
I care about you. I...

41:11.936 --> 41:17.169
<i>So we watch from the sidelines,</i>
<i>clinging to our isolation.</i>

41:20.344 --> 41:22.505
- It glows.
- Yeah.

41:26.650 --> 41:31.349
When my mother was
a resident she wasn't dropping kidneys.

41:31.388 --> 41:34.152
- You're reading your mom's diary?
- Mmm...

41:35.626 --> 41:38.254
I'm not half the surgeon my mother was.

41:48.372 --> 41:51.432
<i>Because we know as soon as</i>
<i>we let go of the bench...</i>

41:52.176 --> 41:55.907

- There are no real men left, Joe.

41:55.946 --> 41:57.846
See ya.

41:58.916 --> 42:01.407
Hey.
Shot and a beer. Whiskey.

42:02.653 --> 42:06.020
Know what? Better make it just the beer.
I start work tomorrow.

42:06.056 --> 42:09.548
<i>...someone comes along</i>
<i>and changes the game completely.</i>
