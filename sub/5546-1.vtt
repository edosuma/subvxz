00:40.993 --> 00:45.487
There are many universes
and many earths...

00:45.531 --> 00:47.522
parallel to each other.

00:49.735 --> 00:51.293
Worlds like yours...

00:51.337 --> 00:54.795
where people's souls
live inside their bodies...

01:00.045 --> 01:02.138
and worlds like mine...

01:02.181 --> 01:04.479
where they walk beside us...

01:04.516 --> 01:08.316
as animal spirits
we call dæmons.

01:10.089 --> 01:11.920
Are we going to see the child?

01:13.225 --> 01:14.988
I should think so.

01:16.328 --> 01:18.262
So many worlds...

01:18.297 --> 01:21.528
but connecting them all is Dust.

01:21.567 --> 01:24.900
Dust was here before
the witches of the air...

01:24.937 --> 01:27.963
the Gyptians of the water...

01:28.007 --> 01:30.498
and the bears of the ice.

01:32.411 --> 01:36.370
In my world,
scholars invented an alethiometer...

01:38.150 --> 01:40.448
a golden compass...

01:40.486 --> 01:43.421
and it showed them
all that was hidden.

01:45.157 --> 01:49.253
But the ruling power, fearing
any truth but their own...

01:49.294 --> 01:52.161
destroyed these devices...

01:52.197 --> 01:56.463
and forbade
the very mention of Dust.

01:56.502 --> 01:59.869
One compass remains, however...

01:59.905 --> 02:02.669
and only one who can read it.

02:03.042 --> 02:04.407
You'll never get me!

02:07.846 --> 02:09.871
Let's go get 'em, Lyra.

02:10.282 --> 02:11.647
Come on!

02:11.683 --> 02:13.014
Gonna get you!

02:13.052 --> 02:14.986
I'll get you first!

02:15.020 --> 02:16.681
Billy!

02:16.722 --> 02:18.690
You come back here!

02:18.724 --> 02:20.123
Leave me alone!

02:20.159 --> 02:21.456
Faster, faster!

02:21.493 --> 02:23.222
We're gonna get you!

02:23.262 --> 02:24.991
Run, Roger!

02:27.699 --> 02:28.723
You are now Gobbled!

02:28.767 --> 02:32.396
You've gotta do whatever I say!

02:34.206 --> 02:36.174
Go, Roger! Run!

02:39.411 --> 02:40.378
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

02:40.412 --> 02:43.245
- Leave us alone!
- Get him!

02:46.618 --> 02:48.210
Come on. Run!

02:51.290 --> 02:53.019
Hurry up, Roger,
or they'll Gobble you!

02:54.059 --> 02:55.253
Faster!

03:00.432 --> 03:02.525
Hurry up!

03:02.568 --> 03:04.866
Stop!

03:04.903 --> 03:08.862
If you value your lives,
come no further.

03:08.907 --> 03:10.101
Why?

03:10.142 --> 03:11.905
We Gobbled him fair and square.

03:11.944 --> 03:14.412
This ain't no game, Billy Costa.

03:14.446 --> 03:16.346
Don't you know what this gate is?

03:16.381 --> 03:18.679
It's the back door
to your stupid college.

03:18.717 --> 03:19.706
So?

03:19.751 --> 03:22.219
There's a curse on this gate.

03:22.254 --> 03:24.916
You Gyptians ought to know that.

03:24.957 --> 03:26.117
Crossin' this gate...

03:26.158 --> 03:28.718
is worse than touching
someone's dæmon...

03:28.760 --> 03:30.091
with your bare hands.

03:30.129 --> 03:32.461
Why ain't nothin'
happened to you, then?

03:32.498 --> 03:34.295
'Cause we live 'ere.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.426
We got safe passage, see?

03:36.468 --> 03:38.993
And anyway, my mother's
the one who put the curse...

03:39.037 --> 03:40.698
on this gate in the first place.

03:40.739 --> 03:42.070
What mother?

03:42.107 --> 03:43.802
I heard you was an orphink...

03:43.842 --> 03:47.039
and your uncle only left you 'ere
'cause nobody wanted you.

03:47.079 --> 03:48.603
Come 'ere and say that.

03:49.448 --> 03:51.313
Don't, Billy.

03:53.285 --> 03:55.116
You should listen to your mate.

03:55.154 --> 03:58.783
The scholars got this special room
where they deal with trespassers.

03:58.824 --> 04:00.849
They got this poison gown, right...

04:00.893 --> 04:02.793
and it burns you alive!

04:02.828 --> 04:05.729
Rubbish. Hand him over.

04:06.498 --> 04:10.400
It ain't rubbish.
I'll prove it. I'll steal it.

04:10.435 --> 04:12.096
You can have Roger.

04:12.137 --> 04:14.662
As long as you try it on.

04:14.706 --> 04:17.607
All right. Bring it with you tonight.

04:17.642 --> 04:18.904
Or else...

04:19.845 --> 04:21.369
War.

04:22.814 --> 04:24.281
Billy, don't!

04:26.251 --> 04:27.479
See ya later, then.

04:27.519 --> 04:29.419
OK.

04:30.889 --> 04:32.914
Well done, Billy!

04:32.958 --> 04:34.983
You ain't really gonna
hand me over to them?

04:35.027 --> 04:36.494
Of course not.

04:36.528 --> 04:38.291
I'll steal any old scholar's gown.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.264
He'll never try it on anyway.

04:47.739 --> 04:49.172
- Lord Asriel?
- Morning, Hunt.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.802
Well, the Master will be relieved
to hear you've arrived safely.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.367
I'm sure he will.

05:26.645 --> 05:29.045
I wish you'd listen
to me once in a while.

05:29.081 --> 05:30.981
Stop being such a coward.

05:31.016 --> 05:33.416
If I weren't such a coward,
where would you be?

05:33.452 --> 05:36.421
In the Retiring Room already.

05:42.861 --> 05:44.226
Come on, quick.

05:49.534 --> 05:51.764
Let's find a robe
and get out of here.

05:52.704 --> 05:56.037
Don't be silly.
I want to look around.

05:56.074 --> 05:58.838
You do know that if you get
a smack, I hurt too?

06:04.316 --> 06:06.113
Oh, Lyra.

06:06.151 --> 06:08.745
You're gonna get us caught.

06:12.557 --> 06:15.287
Oh, no! I told you!

06:18.397 --> 06:20.991
Lord Asriel is an eminent
fellow of the college.

06:21.033 --> 06:25.026
And as master of Jordan,
you must force him...

06:25.070 --> 06:26.935
to abandon his plan.

06:26.972 --> 06:29.406
They're talking about Uncle Asriel.

06:29.441 --> 06:32.069
I speak for the Magisterium.

06:32.110 --> 06:35.477
The Magisterium has no authority
within these walls.

06:35.514 --> 06:38.312
My dear fellow...

06:38.350 --> 06:41.649
the Magisterium
has authority everywhere...

06:42.888 --> 06:46.153
and Lord Asriel will be silenced...

06:46.191 --> 06:49.183
one way or another.

06:49.227 --> 06:51.320
That may be.

06:51.363 --> 06:54.264
But while he is at Jordan,
his proposal will be heard.

06:55.834 --> 06:59.326
I'll not dispense with centuries
of tolerance and free inquiry.

06:59.371 --> 07:01.339
And that's my final word
on the matter.

07:02.341 --> 07:04.332
Now, if you'll excuse me...

07:09.014 --> 07:11.482
I shall call the Council to order.

07:18.056 --> 07:19.489
I guess we lost that bet.

07:19.524 --> 07:21.992
Hush, Pan.

07:46.585 --> 07:49.577
Lyra, he's leaving. Let's go.

07:49.621 --> 07:50.610
Lyra.

07:52.157 --> 07:55.820
- The professor--a really hard time.
- Oh, no.

07:56.995 --> 07:58.656
It's Stelmaria.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.398
The master asked me to decant a bottle
of the '99 Tokay for you, Lord Asriel.

08:06.438 --> 08:08.406
He remembered
you were partial to it.

08:09.241 --> 08:10.265
Thank you.

08:29.261 --> 08:31.058
- Lyra!
- It's poisoned.

08:31.096 --> 08:33.222
- Nonsense.
- It ain't nonsense.

08:33.265 --> 08:35.495
I saw that man
from the Magisterium...

08:35.534 --> 08:37.501
pour some powder into the wine.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.398
Go back in there.

08:43.442 --> 08:45.000
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

08:45.043 --> 08:46.977
Go on.

08:55.420 --> 08:58.287
Ah, Lord Asriel.

08:58.323 --> 08:59.813
This is a rare pleasure.

08:59.858 --> 09:05.057
May I introduce
Fra Pavel of the Magisterium?

09:05.096 --> 09:10.796
We've never met, but I've followed
your exploits closely, Lord Asriel.

09:10.836 --> 09:12.463
That's what the smell is.

09:12.504 --> 09:14.972
Master, gentlemen,
I shall get straight to the point.

09:15.006 --> 09:16.633
Hunt, the lights.

09:18.977 --> 09:22.276
This photogram was taken
at the magnetic North Pole...

09:23.849 --> 09:26.283
in Svalbard...

09:27.886 --> 09:29.877
kingdom of the ice bears.

09:29.921 --> 09:31.821
Ice bears, Pan.

09:31.857 --> 09:35.953
Lord Asriel, is that light rising up
from the man's body or coming down?

09:35.994 --> 09:39.054
No, that's coming down from the sky,
but that's not light.

09:43.068 --> 09:44.501
- It's Dust.
- Dust?

09:49.407 --> 09:51.898
- What's Dust?
- I don't know.

09:51.943 --> 09:53.433
It can't be the normal sort.

09:53.478 --> 09:55.844
They've got plenty of that here.

09:55.881 --> 09:57.712
Mirabile dictu, gentlemen.

09:57.749 --> 10:01.014
Allow Lord Asriel to explain.

10:01.052 --> 10:04.647
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

10:04.689 --> 10:08.125
It could be an aberration
or malfunction of some kind.

10:08.159 --> 10:11.026
No, it is no aberration.

10:12.297 --> 10:15.664
The behavior of these particles
is quite unmistakable.

10:15.700 --> 10:20.296
Dust is flowing into this man,
through his dæmon...

10:20.338 --> 10:23.034
from a city in another world.

10:23.074 --> 10:27.033
A world much like ours in a parallel
universe coexisting with our own.

10:27.078 --> 10:30.275
Invisible, intangible, inaccessible!

10:30.315 --> 10:31.339
Until now.

10:31.383 --> 10:35.114
From there, and from
a billion other worlds, Dust flows.

10:35.153 --> 10:37.849
Worlds of infinite possibilities.

10:37.889 --> 10:39.481
Some where men have no dæmons.

10:39.524 --> 10:41.219
Some where dæmons have no men.

10:41.259 --> 10:43.853
People without dæmons.
That's impossible.

10:43.895 --> 10:46.557
And even some where
there is no Magisterium...

10:48.333 --> 10:50.494
and no Authority.

10:51.436 --> 10:52.994
That is heresy.

10:53.038 --> 10:54.903
That...

10:56.541 --> 10:58.509
is the truth.

10:58.543 --> 11:03.037
I wouldn't recommend the Tokay,
gentlemen. It's corked.

11:03.081 --> 11:06.244
To discover the source of Dust,
I intend to travel to these worlds.

11:06.284 --> 11:08.752
With a sufficient source
of energy and--

11:08.787 --> 11:10.914
Well, a sufficient source of funds...

11:12.524 --> 11:14.355
I can effect a crossing.

11:14.392 --> 11:17.361
I humbly beg the College Council
to fund such a journey.

11:23.468 --> 11:26.096
It wasn't my fault.
She wouldn't listen to me.

11:27.639 --> 11:31.268
I will not have my niece
slithering round like an alley cat.

11:31.309 --> 11:34.278
You're not very grateful, are you?

11:34.312 --> 11:36.041
I've just saved your life.

11:38.817 --> 11:41.047
Uncle, why did he try
to poison you?

11:41.086 --> 11:42.747
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yes, I would.

11:42.787 --> 11:44.687
Well, I don't see why.

11:44.723 --> 11:46.748
Apparently you're
impossible to educate.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.520
A miscreant and a liar.

11:51.062 --> 11:53.724
What will the Magisterium
do to you now?

11:53.765 --> 11:56.393
The Magisterium's days
are numbered.

11:56.434 --> 11:58.163
What does that mean?

11:58.203 --> 12:00.467
Trouble, with a bit of luck.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.740
Did you get the money you needed?

12:03.775 --> 12:05.208
Are you going North again?

12:05.243 --> 12:07.973
The College Council
has defied the Magisterium.

12:08.013 --> 12:09.947
I'm leaving immediately.

12:09.981 --> 12:11.471
Can I come with you?

12:11.516 --> 12:13.347
I want to see the ice bears
and glaciers...

12:13.385 --> 12:15.046
and learn about Dust
and everything.

12:15.086 --> 12:17.213
What do you know about Dust?

12:17.255 --> 12:18.779
- Nothing.
- Good.

12:18.823 --> 12:20.154
Keep it that way.

12:20.191 --> 12:22.455
Now be a good girl
and do what you're told.

12:22.494 --> 12:24.291
But you don't do what you're told.

12:24.329 --> 12:26.354
You don't let anybody
tell you what to do.

12:26.398 --> 12:28.229
Yes, and look at the welcome I got.

12:32.303 --> 12:33.736
Hush, Pan.

12:33.772 --> 12:35.899
I see your dæmon
still changes shape.

12:35.940 --> 12:37.805
Hasn't settled yet.

12:37.842 --> 12:39.332
Yeah.

12:41.479 --> 12:43.970
That's to do with Dust, isn't it?

12:44.015 --> 12:45.949
Why kids' dæmons
can change shape...

12:45.984 --> 12:47.849
but grown-ups' dæmons can't.

12:48.787 --> 12:50.948
Lyra.

12:50.989 --> 12:53.082
Dust is none of your business.

12:54.492 --> 12:56.460
Now you try and behave.

13:10.975 --> 13:15.810
My Uncle Asriel said he'd take me
to the North next time he goes. He swore it.

13:15.847 --> 13:17.405
'Cause he needs my help, see.

13:17.449 --> 13:18.780
What for?

13:19.818 --> 13:21.649
Fightin', probably.

13:21.686 --> 13:23.278
Or spying.

13:23.321 --> 13:25.289
He uses me as a spy sometimes.

13:25.323 --> 13:27.257
Like now, for instance.

13:27.292 --> 13:29.226
I'm supposed to be keeping
an eye on them Gobblers--

13:29.260 --> 13:30.249
Come on!

13:30.295 --> 13:32.695
...'cause they took them
Gyptian kids up Banbury way.

13:32.731 --> 13:34.164
Billy Costa told me.

13:34.199 --> 13:37.327
I heard them Gobblers
take you down to hell.

13:37.368 --> 13:39.336
Course they don't.

13:40.739 --> 13:42.570
You're afraid of them, ain't you?

13:42.607 --> 13:43.699
No, I ain't.

13:46.678 --> 13:50.045
But the adults are,
because kids keep disappearin'.

13:50.081 --> 13:52.345
They go after the poor kids, see.

13:52.383 --> 13:56.319
The orphans
and the servant kids as well.

13:56.354 --> 13:58.948
Roger, I promise...

13:58.990 --> 14:01.584
if you was taken by the Gobblers...

14:01.626 --> 14:02.888
I'd come and rescue you.

14:04.729 --> 14:06.720
You'd come and get me too,
wouldn't you?

14:06.765 --> 14:10.531
Course. But everybody would go
looking for you if you was Gobbled.

14:10.568 --> 14:12.729
- You're a lady.
- Says who?

14:12.771 --> 14:17.071
Cook. He says that's why your uncle
left you here, to make you a lady.

14:17.108 --> 14:18.905
Nobody can make me a lady.

14:18.943 --> 14:22.777
Not the master and scholars
and porters combined, right?

14:22.814 --> 14:26.113
Take it back, or we ain't
best mates no more!

14:26.151 --> 14:28.051
All right, all right,
you ain't a lady.

14:28.086 --> 14:29.781
Lyra!

14:29.821 --> 14:33.188
Lyra Belacqua,
get down off them roofs!

14:33.224 --> 14:34.782
The Master wants you at high table!

14:37.428 --> 14:40.363
It was really--
really quite surprising.

14:40.398 --> 14:42.593
The state of your knees.

14:42.634 --> 14:44.761
And your hair.

14:44.803 --> 14:45.792
Well--

14:47.238 --> 14:48.603
It's not surprising.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.438
Roger and me's
been huntin' Gobblers.

14:51.476 --> 14:53.205
It's dirty work.

14:53.244 --> 14:56.645
'Ere, don't you make jokes
about them Gobblers.

14:56.681 --> 14:59.479
Ain't nothin' to play about
when children go missing.

15:10.728 --> 15:12.491
Lyra, my dear...

15:12.530 --> 15:16.125
the tutor of metaphysics tells me
that you've missed your lesson again.

15:16.167 --> 15:20.103
Now, I know you do not always
understand our need to educate you...

15:20.138 --> 15:24.472
but sometimes you must do
what others think...best.

15:26.177 --> 15:28.338
But I disagree, Master.

15:28.913 --> 15:29.902
Mrs. Coulter.

15:32.584 --> 15:33.983
When I was a young woman...

15:34.018 --> 15:37.078
I knew that no one could ever
really truly understand me...

15:37.121 --> 15:39.282
except, of course, my dæmon...

15:39.324 --> 15:42.350
and that it would be best
if we were free to do as we pleased.

15:47.332 --> 15:49.323
Sit down, gentlemen.

15:49.901 --> 15:51.926
- Who's she?
- Don't know.

15:51.970 --> 15:54.302
But she shut up the Master, all right.

15:54.339 --> 16:00.972
Mrs. Coulter? This is our Lyra,
Lyra Belacqua, Lord Asriel's niece.

16:01.012 --> 16:03.480
Lyra, this is Mrs. Coulter...

16:03.514 --> 16:05.778
a friend of the college.

16:08.519 --> 16:10.350
Lovely to meet you.

16:10.388 --> 16:13.221
Lovely to meet you too.

16:13.258 --> 16:16.250
Do you know I've met Lord Asriel?

16:16.861 --> 16:19.159
It was at the Royal Arctic Institute.

16:19.797 --> 16:21.731
We discussed
the political structure...

16:21.766 --> 16:24.132
of the ice bears of Svalbard.

16:25.036 --> 16:26.901
You've seen an ice bear?

16:27.739 --> 16:28.933
As a matter of fact...

16:28.973 --> 16:31.635
I have had an audience
with the bear king himself...

16:31.676 --> 16:33.200
Ragnar Sturlusson.

16:33.244 --> 16:35.838
And I'll tell you something
I probably shouldn't--

16:37.315 --> 16:40.876
King Ragnar is desperate
to have a dæmon of his own.

16:43.121 --> 16:46.022
Bears don't have them, you see,
and Ragnar...

16:46.057 --> 16:48.548
he likes to think of himself
as a person...

16:48.593 --> 16:51.391
and he will stop at nothing to get one.

16:53.431 --> 16:55.023
But you mustn't repeat that.

16:55.066 --> 16:56.761
Oh, I'd never.

16:59.904 --> 17:02.099
You know, I feel I can trust you.

17:06.377 --> 17:09.278
I have to go back
to the North very soon.

17:09.314 --> 17:11.281
I'm going to need an assistant.

17:12.784 --> 17:14.251
Me?

17:14.285 --> 17:16.276
- Go to the North?
- North?

17:16.320 --> 17:17.845
It's cold up there.

17:17.888 --> 17:20.357
We'd better get
the Master's permission.

17:22.492 --> 17:25.087
Master, I was wondering...

17:25.128 --> 17:27.619
if I might borrow dear Lyra.

17:29.801 --> 17:31.325
Only for a while, of course.

17:33.037 --> 17:34.629
I'm not sure
that would be consistent with...

17:34.672 --> 17:37.197
Lord Asriel's wishes
for her education.

17:39.377 --> 17:41.971
Let me deal with Asriel.

17:42.013 --> 17:45.414
You mustn't deny me
this little thing, you really mustn't.

17:53.992 --> 17:55.425
Very well.

17:58.896 --> 18:00.887
Yeah--

18:02.233 --> 18:04.258
Yeah--

18:11.642 --> 18:12.973
A bet's a bet...

18:13.011 --> 18:15.741
and Lyra was supposed
to show up with the gown.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.146
I told you they wouldn't
let her out of the college.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.740
Which one's her room?

18:19.784 --> 18:21.308
What are you gonna do?

18:21.352 --> 18:23.183
Give her a fright, that's all.

18:23.221 --> 18:25.951
We get caught,
I'll be skinned alive.

18:25.990 --> 18:28.982
Night porter's bound
to be doin' his rounds.

18:29.027 --> 18:31.154
Ratter, check if the coast is clear.

18:44.342 --> 18:45.775
It's all clear.

18:49.414 --> 18:51.939
Billy! Billy!

19:00.658 --> 19:05.527
The scholars still refuse
to hand over the last alethiometer...

19:05.563 --> 19:09.727
and now they've given Asriel
all the funds he needs.

19:10.568 --> 19:14.095
If he succeeds in proving
the existence of these other worlds...

19:14.138 --> 19:17.972
it will contradict
centuries of teaching.

19:18.009 --> 19:22.173
There will always be
freethinkers and heretics...

19:22.213 --> 19:26.980
unless we deal
with the root of the problem.

19:27.018 --> 19:29.851
That is why Mrs. Coulter's work
is so important.

19:31.856 --> 19:33.517
What progress has she made?

19:33.558 --> 19:36.652
The doctors at Bolvangar...

19:36.694 --> 19:39.822
are close to perfecting
the inoculation...

19:39.864 --> 19:43.823
against the effects of Dust.

19:43.868 --> 19:47.065
I am relieved to hear that.

19:47.105 --> 19:51.303
If we can protect our children
from the corrupting influence of Dust...

19:51.342 --> 19:54.072
before their dæmons settle...

19:54.112 --> 19:58.310
then we will nurture a generation
at peace with itself...

19:58.349 --> 20:02.115
one that will never question
our authority again.

20:03.855 --> 20:06.255
We owe it to the young...

20:07.425 --> 20:09.120
do we not?

20:12.864 --> 20:15.560
I fear our defiance
will not go unpunished...

20:19.770 --> 20:22.364
now she'll be drawn into it.

20:22.406 --> 20:23.430
We've failed her.

20:23.474 --> 20:27.934
We've protected her
as long as we could, Master.

20:27.979 --> 20:29.503
And she's still only a child.

20:29.547 --> 20:31.378
She can't possibly be
a threat to them.

20:31.415 --> 20:33.280
She is.

20:33.317 --> 20:36.878
She's meant to play
a major part in what is to come.

20:38.356 --> 20:40.221
How can you know such things?

20:42.293 --> 20:43.920
The witches.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.464
Thank you. Could you--

20:50.501 --> 20:53.402
Could you stay
by the door, Mrs. Lonsdale?

20:53.437 --> 20:55.962
It's important that I know
if I was followed.

20:56.007 --> 20:57.975
Why yes, Master.

21:03.748 --> 21:06.342
It's for you, Lyra.

21:06.384 --> 21:07.851
What is this?

21:07.885 --> 21:09.819
An alethiometer.

21:09.854 --> 21:13.984
Also known as a golden compass.

21:16.694 --> 21:20.858
It was given to the college
by Lord Asriel many years ago.

21:20.898 --> 21:24.334
And now I'm giving it to you.

21:24.368 --> 21:27.269
I feel you are meant to have it.

21:27.305 --> 21:29.569
What's it for?

21:31.876 --> 21:34.504
It tells the truth.

21:34.545 --> 21:36.911
We've always tried
to acquaint you with the truth.

21:36.948 --> 21:39.917
But the secrets at the heart
of things elude scholars...

21:39.951 --> 21:42.044
and, uh, Authorities.

21:42.086 --> 21:45.852
But this lets you
glimpse things as they are.

21:47.325 --> 21:51.091
But, Lyra,
keep the alethiometer to yourself.

21:51.128 --> 21:52.425
It is of the utmost importance...

21:52.463 --> 21:54.863
that Mrs. Coulter
does not know that you have it.

21:54.899 --> 21:55.923
Do you understand me?

21:55.967 --> 21:57.958
Of the utmost importance.

22:02.573 --> 22:05.906
Lyra. Are you ready?

22:07.778 --> 22:09.245
There's someone missing.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.407
I want to say goodbye to Roger.

22:11.449 --> 22:15.044
Roger? Who's Roger?

22:15.086 --> 22:17.646
My friend.
He works in the kitchens.

22:18.889 --> 22:21.551
We must go.
The ferry's about to take off.

22:23.227 --> 22:24.888
Why don't you write him a letter?

22:24.929 --> 22:27.124
You can tell him
all about the journey, and...

22:27.164 --> 22:28.791
you can even send him a photogram.

22:28.833 --> 22:29.959
- Madam.
- What do you think?

22:30.001 --> 22:32.128
Yeah. I suppose.

23:03.734 --> 23:06.328
- Anything else, madam?
- That'll be all.

23:09.740 --> 23:12.072
Mrs. Coulter, what's that?

23:13.544 --> 23:16.911
That is the Magisterial seat, Lyra.

23:18.849 --> 23:21.409
What's the Magisterium for?

23:21.452 --> 23:24.615
Oh, you have been living
in an ivory tower, haven't you?

23:24.655 --> 23:28.022
The Magisterium
is what people need.

23:29.393 --> 23:33.124
They keep things working
by telling people what to do.

23:33.164 --> 23:37.157
But...you told the Master
you did whatever you pleased.

23:39.303 --> 23:42.363
That's right. Clever girl.

23:42.406 --> 23:45.967
Well, some people know
what's best for them...

23:46.010 --> 23:47.477
and some people don't.

23:48.179 --> 23:50.238
Besides, they don't tell
people what to do...

23:50.281 --> 23:51.543
in a mean, petty way...

23:51.582 --> 23:53.846
they tell them what
to do in a kindly way...

23:53.884 --> 23:56.352
to keep them out of danger.

23:57.855 --> 23:59.152
Sugar?

24:54.845 --> 24:59.976
Look, Pan, it's got
loads of pictures round the edge.

25:00.017 --> 25:01.712
But what do they all mean?

25:01.752 --> 25:03.583
Don't know.

25:05.489 --> 25:09.585
The needle keeps stopping
at the same symbols--

25:09.627 --> 25:11.458
Lady...

25:11.495 --> 25:13.326
lightning bolt...

25:13.364 --> 25:15.491
and the baby.

25:15.533 --> 25:18.832
Then it goes back
and does it again. See?

25:18.869 --> 25:21.565
What do you think
makes the needle move?

25:21.605 --> 25:24.972
I don't know.
Maybe Uncle Asriel knows.

25:27.044 --> 25:29.638
Maybe we're supposed
to take it to him.

25:34.385 --> 25:36.319
All washed and ready for bed?

25:38.322 --> 25:40.085
We have a busy few weeks.

25:58.075 --> 26:01.203
Well, it was
a stylish enough party...

26:01.245 --> 26:03.770
but why they don't offer
more ice with their drinks...

26:03.814 --> 26:05.679
I shall never understand.

26:05.716 --> 26:08.014
I'll only be a moment, darling.

26:08.052 --> 26:09.542
Official business.

26:13.724 --> 26:14.884
What?

26:14.925 --> 26:18.190
She likes to show off
her new pet, doesn't she?

26:18.229 --> 26:20.789
She's never taking us to the North.

26:20.831 --> 26:22.423
We're like prisoners in this house.

26:22.466 --> 26:25.526
All these rules, and rooms
that we aren't allowed into.

26:28.606 --> 26:32.007
Perhaps we shouldn't have
invited Professor Docker.

26:32.042 --> 26:33.873
He's such a bore, isn't he?

26:33.911 --> 26:35.879
And he had sauce in his beard.

26:39.383 --> 26:43.080
But he is one of the foremost
experts on particle metaphysics.

26:44.388 --> 26:46.618
Have I taught you
what a particle is?

26:46.657 --> 26:48.852
Oh, I know about particles.

26:48.893 --> 26:50.053
Like Dust.

26:50.761 --> 26:52.353
That's a particle, isn't it?

26:53.531 --> 26:54.998
Dust?

26:55.032 --> 26:57.159
I mean the Dust from space.

26:57.201 --> 26:59.431
That Dust, like in the North.

26:59.470 --> 27:01.335
Where did you hear about that?

27:03.107 --> 27:05.166
It must have been
one of the scholars at Jordan.

27:10.748 --> 27:12.443
A wise person knows, Lyra...

27:12.483 --> 27:14.678
that there are some things
that we best ignore...

27:14.718 --> 27:18.711
subjects that you--
well, you never speak about.

27:20.124 --> 27:22.285
- But I didn't--
- Yes.

27:22.326 --> 27:25.227
You didn't know, so I forgive you.

27:25.262 --> 27:27.025
Just don't mention it again.

27:29.066 --> 27:30.533
Now, darling...

27:30.568 --> 27:33.696
will you take off that
childish shoulder bag?

27:33.737 --> 27:36.171
I don't like to see you
wearing it indoors.

27:38.542 --> 27:40.407
Please, Mrs. Coulter.

27:41.445 --> 27:42.935
I do love it.

27:43.714 --> 27:45.204
But I do not.

27:48.886 --> 27:50.581
Put it away.

27:54.625 --> 27:56.752
Lyra, put it away now.

27:56.794 --> 27:58.386
I don't want to.

27:59.863 --> 28:01.592
If you do not obey me...

28:01.632 --> 28:03.327
we will have an argument
which I will win.

28:03.367 --> 28:05.267
Now put it away at once.

28:05.302 --> 28:07.998
It's absurd to be carrying
around a shoulder bag...

28:08.038 --> 28:10.006
in your own home.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.905
Jordan is my home.

28:14.278 --> 28:16.007
No! Lyra!

28:17.314 --> 28:19.805
Don't. Please, it hurts!

28:19.850 --> 28:21.112
Lyra!

28:22.152 --> 28:23.278
Lyra!

28:23.320 --> 28:24.810
Will you do as I tell you?

28:24.855 --> 28:26.117
I promise.

28:30.661 --> 28:32.219
Lyra.

28:33.697 --> 28:35.494
Thank you.

28:37.401 --> 28:39.665
And while you're at it, you must
learn to control your dæmon.

28:39.703 --> 28:41.534
He's much too wild.

28:41.572 --> 28:43.802
Now...

28:43.841 --> 28:45.934
Kiss me.

28:49.179 --> 28:50.373
I hate her!

28:51.915 --> 28:53.815
I hate them!

28:53.851 --> 28:55.216
And look.

28:55.252 --> 28:57.049
They're spying on us.

29:02.726 --> 29:04.956
What do they want with us?

29:04.995 --> 29:06.963
Why are we here?

29:06.997 --> 29:08.521
Did you see her dæmon?

29:08.565 --> 29:11.159
He went all sharp
when you mentioned Dust.

29:11.201 --> 29:13.567
And what does she keep
in that room?

29:13.604 --> 29:15.265
Let's go find out.

29:30.988 --> 29:33.582
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

29:40.064 --> 29:41.793
Over here.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.698
Look.

29:58.015 --> 30:00.415
That's just one of
her stupid guest lists.

30:00.451 --> 30:01.782
No, it isn't.

30:01.819 --> 30:03.514
Look at it.

30:08.559 --> 30:10.424
"lnter...cision."

30:11.295 --> 30:13.388
What does it mean, Pan?

30:13.430 --> 30:14.419
And that--

30:14.465 --> 30:17.901
"General...Oblation Board."

30:17.935 --> 30:20.529
G--O--B.

30:22.106 --> 30:24.006
Gobblers.

30:24.041 --> 30:27.169
From the letters, G--O--B.

30:29.246 --> 30:33.478
"Workman, Edwards, Parslow, Costa!"

30:33.517 --> 30:34.984
Billy and Roger!

30:38.088 --> 30:40.579
Pan, it's her.
She's running the Gobblers.

30:40.624 --> 30:42.148
Lyra, where are you?

30:42.192 --> 30:43.819
We have to get out of here.

30:46.296 --> 30:48.093
Lyr--

30:48.132 --> 30:49.463
Lyra.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.967
What have you been doing?

30:51.001 --> 30:52.127
Nothing.

30:52.169 --> 30:53.966
Well, we must find
something for you to do.

30:54.004 --> 30:56.973
Shall you help me
arrange our passage to Norroway?

30:58.976 --> 31:02.412
Oh, you do want to come
to the North with me, don't you?

31:02.446 --> 31:04.607
Where is he? I don't see him.

31:14.825 --> 31:17.020
Lyra, this way!

31:18.562 --> 31:20.587
Quick, Lyra!

31:24.835 --> 31:25.859
Lyra!

31:33.577 --> 31:35.807
What are we gonna do, Pan?

31:35.846 --> 31:38.815
We've got to save Roger...
and Billy.

31:38.849 --> 31:40.714
We've got
to save ourselves first!

31:40.751 --> 31:41.945
Where are we gonna go?

31:41.985 --> 31:43.850
Anywhere's better than here.

31:45.222 --> 31:47.850
Come on! This way!

31:52.462 --> 31:54.828
All right, then.
Split up. The girl can't be far.

31:56.099 --> 31:57.657
Spread out.
Search all the buildings.

31:57.701 --> 31:58.827
Gobblers!

31:58.869 --> 32:00.769
You, cover the canal.

32:02.706 --> 32:04.901
She's gotta be here somewhere.

32:13.717 --> 32:15.184
Wait up, Johnny!

32:15.219 --> 32:17.050
Put your back into it!

32:17.087 --> 32:18.213
We'll need two more of them.

32:19.556 --> 32:23.185
Come on, lovely, lovely
and fresh. Lovely and fresh.

32:23.227 --> 32:26.719
Hurry!

32:30.367 --> 32:31.834
Get her!

32:31.869 --> 32:33.097
Get it!

32:36.740 --> 32:38.264
Pan!

32:38.308 --> 32:40.003
Hurry, Lyra!

32:47.217 --> 32:48.809
Lyra!

32:49.052 --> 32:50.041
Hold her!

32:52.589 --> 32:54.022
No!

33:07.004 --> 33:09.837
- Lyra!
- Pan.

33:09.873 --> 33:11.864
Gyptians.

33:16.546 --> 33:18.275
Don't fret none, Lyra.

33:19.516 --> 33:20.744
Come 'ere.

33:23.186 --> 33:25.177
You're safe with us.

33:25.222 --> 33:27.520
You're Ma Costa.

33:27.557 --> 33:28.615
Billy's mum.

33:30.193 --> 33:31.626
But what are you doing here?

33:31.662 --> 33:32.993
We been in your shadow...

33:33.030 --> 33:36.295
ever since you left
Jordan College, watchin' over you.

33:36.333 --> 33:38.824
And a good thing too.

33:38.869 --> 33:40.894
You best come with us.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.330
Hurry, lads.

33:43.373 --> 33:44.931
Where are we going?

33:44.975 --> 33:47.705
To see Lord Faa,
King of the Gyptians.

33:47.744 --> 33:49.974
Come on, get yourself aboard.

34:36.226 --> 34:38.456
Not very friendly, are they?

34:38.495 --> 34:40.292
What are you lookin' at?

34:46.136 --> 34:47.797
So now all the clans are here...

34:47.838 --> 34:50.568
we'll head North on the next tide.

34:52.376 --> 34:53.502
Ma Costa.

34:55.245 --> 34:57.509
This is the child?

34:59.516 --> 35:01.916
It's all right.

35:05.822 --> 35:07.187
How do you do, Lord Faa?

35:10.794 --> 35:12.557
Hello, Lyra.

35:14.064 --> 35:15.861
You come and sit by my side.

35:15.899 --> 35:16.957
Right, boys, get your heads up!

35:18.135 --> 35:20.296
This is Farder Coram.

35:20.337 --> 35:22.328
Head for the ice lake!

35:22.372 --> 35:26.331
And these are the chiefs
of the Gyptian families.

35:26.376 --> 35:29.834
You are our guest here,
and you're under our protection.

35:30.747 --> 35:32.044
Lord Faa...

35:33.150 --> 35:34.549
I want to thank you.

35:34.584 --> 35:37.314
For keeping watch on me and all.

35:37.354 --> 35:39.652
But why did you do it?

35:39.689 --> 35:42.954
Lord Asriel has been
a good friend to the Gyptians...

35:42.993 --> 35:47.396
this many a year, and this many
a year it has been our charge...

35:47.431 --> 35:51.265
to bring him news of you
as we travel along our ways.

35:52.335 --> 35:54.462
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

35:55.772 --> 36:01.142
And when Mrs. Coulter
got a hold of you, well...

36:01.178 --> 36:04.477
we suspected that she had
something to do with the Gobblers.

36:04.514 --> 36:07.039
And she did.

36:07.084 --> 36:10.451
She and them Gobblers
took my little boy Billy.

36:11.922 --> 36:13.822
Lyra.

36:13.857 --> 36:16.121
We know your tale
all the way up until...

36:16.159 --> 36:19.128
you run away
and the Costas found you.

36:19.162 --> 36:22.654
But is there anything else
you can tell us?

36:22.699 --> 36:25.600
Is there anything
you may have forgot?

36:26.570 --> 36:28.265
Don't show it to them.

36:30.273 --> 36:32.707
The Master of Jordan gave me this.

36:35.078 --> 36:38.809
I thought they was
all taken by the Magisterium.

36:44.054 --> 36:45.919
It's an alethiometer.

36:45.956 --> 36:47.981
It's a truth measurer.

36:48.024 --> 36:50.424
A golden compass.

36:50.460 --> 36:55.090
It enables you to see
what others wish to hide.

36:55.132 --> 36:59.034
You got three hands
you can control.

36:59.069 --> 37:02.527
By pointing at three symbols...

37:02.572 --> 37:06.201
you can ask any sort of question
you can imagine.

37:07.677 --> 37:09.872
Once you got your question framed...

37:09.913 --> 37:13.144
this blue needle points
to more symbols...

37:13.183 --> 37:15.117
that give you the answer.

37:15.152 --> 37:17.712
Could it be used
to find the missing children?

37:17.754 --> 37:19.278
Not by me.

37:19.322 --> 37:21.153
The art was jealously guarded.

37:21.191 --> 37:22.180
Can I try?

37:25.495 --> 37:26.484
All right.

37:26.530 --> 37:28.020
What are you doing, Lyra?

37:28.064 --> 37:29.361
You don't know how to read it.

37:29.399 --> 37:31.094
Hush, Pan.

37:33.103 --> 37:38.234
Well, the serpent is cunning,
like the Gobblers.

37:38.275 --> 37:41.904
And...the pot could mean
a recipe or a plan.

37:41.945 --> 37:43.810
And...

37:43.847 --> 37:45.314
the baby...

37:45.348 --> 37:47.873
that means kids.

37:47.918 --> 37:49.715
One thing I do know, Lyra...

37:49.753 --> 37:52.950
you mustn't grasp at the answer.

37:52.989 --> 37:56.686
Hold the question
in your mind, but lightly.

37:56.726 --> 37:59.320
Like it was something alive.

38:29.292 --> 38:31.783
It's an hourglass.

38:31.828 --> 38:35.025
But it came round to it
on the second time.

38:35.065 --> 38:38.466
The first time it only
stopped there a moment.

38:39.636 --> 38:42.571
On top of the hourglass...

38:42.606 --> 38:44.335
there's a skull.

38:50.914 --> 38:53.781
Thank you, children.
Finish your letters now.

39:02.459 --> 39:06.452
Billy Costa,
why didn't you write anything?

39:06.496 --> 39:08.327
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.

39:09.866 --> 39:12.926
I don't know what to put
in the letter, miss.

39:12.969 --> 39:14.800
You haven't told us
what we're here for.

39:14.838 --> 39:17.136
You're here to help us.

39:17.173 --> 39:20.768
And just as soon as you've helped us,
we'll send you back home.

39:21.778 --> 39:23.405
That's what you should write.

39:23.446 --> 39:26.006
Or don't they teach
Gyptian children to write?

39:26.816 --> 39:29.649
They teach us
to write the truth, miss.

39:30.687 --> 39:33.417
Billy, just write the letter.

39:33.456 --> 39:37.517
Well, as I'll be posting
these straight away...

39:37.560 --> 39:40.222
I'm afraid your parents
will be disappointed.

39:48.305 --> 39:52.503
I confess I am puzzled
by your interest in the Belacqua girl.

39:52.542 --> 39:56.034
For one thing, she is
in possession of the alethiometer.

39:56.079 --> 39:58.877
How--? Ah, yes. The Master.

40:02.185 --> 40:03.345
Can she read it?

40:03.887 --> 40:06.082
Of course not.

40:06.122 --> 40:08.056
Mrs. Coulter...

40:08.091 --> 40:10.787
are you familiar with
the prophesies of the witches?

40:10.827 --> 40:13.387
You think she is that child?

40:14.364 --> 40:15.353
Impossible.

40:16.599 --> 40:18.897
Nonetheless, she must be found.

40:26.776 --> 40:29.210
They'll seek her out
like bees to honey.

41:02.412 --> 41:04.004
Svalbard.

41:05.482 --> 41:07.279
Kingdom of the ice bears.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.414
We shall have
to watch ourselves, Stelmaria.

41:13.456 --> 41:14.923
You can bet
that Coulter woman has hired...

41:14.958 --> 41:18.655
every Samoyed bandit from here
to the Pole to hunt us down.

42:26.796 --> 42:28.423
Let's not be so hasty.

42:28.465 --> 42:29.693
Why don't we just--

42:29.732 --> 42:31.700
We can work this out
like gentlemen.

43:01.731 --> 43:03.528
Don't worry, Lyra.

43:03.566 --> 43:05.227
We'll find Roger.

43:38.334 --> 43:39.892
I'm all right.

43:42.071 --> 43:43.436
What is it?

43:43.473 --> 43:45.168
It's a spy-fly.

43:45.208 --> 43:46.675
Is it dangerous?

43:48.044 --> 43:50.774
The one that got away is.

43:50.813 --> 43:53.145
If you was to crack it open...

43:53.182 --> 43:55.742
you'd find no living thing in there.

43:55.785 --> 43:58.253
No animal or insect, at any rate.

43:58.288 --> 44:00.222
There's a clockwork...

44:00.256 --> 44:04.124
and pinned to the spring of it
is a bad spirit...

44:04.160 --> 44:06.924
with a sleeping poison in its sting.

44:08.164 --> 44:10.894
We'll keep him safe in here.

44:12.235 --> 44:14.726
What was it after?

44:14.771 --> 44:16.739
- You, Lyra.
- Why me?

44:16.773 --> 44:18.570
Why are they doing this?

44:18.608 --> 44:20.371
We don't know.

44:20.410 --> 44:22.207
But we Gyptians...

44:22.245 --> 44:25.976
have been hurt worse than most
by these Gobblers...

44:26.015 --> 44:28.916
these child-thieves.

44:28.952 --> 44:31.443
They're takin' those children up North...

44:31.487 --> 44:34.615
the land of cold and dark...

44:34.657 --> 44:38.286
and what they're doing
with them there, we don't know...

44:38.328 --> 44:41.092
but we have heard terrible rumor.

44:43.132 --> 44:44.963
Our aim...

44:45.001 --> 44:48.732
is first to go North
and to rescue these children...

44:48.771 --> 44:52.104
both Gyptian and landloper alike.

44:55.244 --> 44:59.442
But if they have been harmed...

44:59.482 --> 45:01.541
I promise you...

45:01.584 --> 45:04.451
if they have been harmed...

45:04.487 --> 45:08.981
there is not a place
nor on land nor on sea...

45:09.025 --> 45:10.788
for these Gobblers.

45:10.827 --> 45:13.796
And when the time comes to punish...

45:13.830 --> 45:19.962
we will strike such a blow as'll make
their hearts faint and fearful.

45:20.003 --> 45:21.027
Yes!

45:21.070 --> 45:24.528
We will strike the strength
out of them.

45:24.574 --> 45:29.341
We will leave them
broken and shattered.

45:29.379 --> 45:30.437
Yes!

45:47.163 --> 45:49.131
Are you getting scared, Pan?

45:49.165 --> 45:50.962
Scared?

45:51.000 --> 45:52.490
A little.

45:53.836 --> 45:56.532
It's all bigger and scarier
than we ever thought.

45:56.572 --> 45:59.735
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

45:59.776 --> 46:03.337
But we've got to, though, ain't we?

46:03.379 --> 46:05.210
Go on, I mean.

46:13.222 --> 46:15.087
Who are you?

46:16.159 --> 46:18.457
My name is Serafina Pekkala...

46:18.494 --> 46:21.292
clan-queen of the witches
of Lake Enara.

46:21.330 --> 46:22.661
A witch?

46:22.699 --> 46:24.690
Where's your dæmon?

46:24.734 --> 46:27.760
Kaisa can fly a long way from me.

46:29.105 --> 46:31.335
Are you the girl
the Magisterium seeks?

46:31.374 --> 46:33.342
The one with a symbol reader?

46:38.448 --> 46:40.279
Let me see you read it.

46:40.316 --> 46:42.511
I want to know
if you can tell me...

46:42.552 --> 46:45.885
which of the men
on this ship was once...

46:45.922 --> 46:47.355
my lover.

47:16.285 --> 47:17.582
Farder Coram?

47:18.621 --> 47:19.849
But--

47:19.889 --> 47:22.483
He was young and beautiful once.

47:22.525 --> 47:25.892
And we witches live
for hundreds of years.

47:25.928 --> 47:27.759
Farder Coram wishes to know...

47:27.797 --> 47:30.265
where the child-cutters
take their prey.

47:30.299 --> 47:32.927
It is a place...

47:32.969 --> 47:35.164
they call Bolvangar.

47:35.204 --> 47:36.933
The place of fear.

47:36.973 --> 47:40.739
A regiment of Tartars
with wolf dæmons guards it.

47:40.777 --> 47:42.904
Birds do not fly above.

47:42.945 --> 47:44.412
Animals have fled.

47:44.447 --> 47:47.075
Even the Samoyeds fear it.

47:48.618 --> 47:52.611
It is a week's march from Trollesund,
on the coast of Norroway.

47:52.655 --> 47:55.681
You will find something
to help you in Trollesund.

47:55.725 --> 47:57.989
You will need all your courage.

48:00.029 --> 48:02.759
I'm glad I've lived long enough
to see you...

48:03.900 --> 48:05.595
child.

48:45.441 --> 48:47.966
Who's going to help us?

48:48.010 --> 48:50.035
Can you see anything?

48:50.079 --> 48:52.604
Lyra, you're not listening to me.

49:04.894 --> 49:07.522
That's a mighty fancy
clockwork you got there.

49:09.999 --> 49:11.694
It's just a toy.

49:13.502 --> 49:16.027
Well, then,
it's a mighty fancy toy.

49:19.942 --> 49:21.842
How'd you come by somethin' like that?

49:21.878 --> 49:26.076
Oh, Lord. Lee, when you gonna learn
to mind your own business?

49:27.116 --> 49:28.913
I do beg pardon.

49:28.951 --> 49:30.612
Lee Scoresby.

49:30.653 --> 49:32.245
And this old gal is Hester.

49:33.623 --> 49:36.057
I'm Lyra. And this is Pan.

49:36.092 --> 49:37.423
Pantalaimon.

49:37.460 --> 49:40.122
- Howdy.
- Mighty pleased, Miss Lyra.

49:41.197 --> 49:44.689
You rode in with them Gyptian fellers.
Am I right?

49:44.734 --> 49:46.861
- Whoa, boy.
- There I go again.

49:46.903 --> 49:48.268
Don't answer that.

49:48.304 --> 49:51.796
What are you doing
in Trollesund, Mr. Scoresby?

49:51.841 --> 49:55.368
Oh, a friend of mine
got himself in a fix.

49:55.411 --> 49:57.709
So I come to see
what I could do about it.

49:57.747 --> 49:59.214
Me too.

49:59.248 --> 50:01.478
Course, that ain't
my normal occupation.

50:01.517 --> 50:05.851
Most of the time,
I ply my trade up in the sky.

50:06.923 --> 50:08.390
You're an aeronaut!

50:09.926 --> 50:11.826
Can I go up in your ship?

50:11.861 --> 50:14.056
I'd be honored.

50:14.096 --> 50:16.087
Just as soon as
I get her out of hock.

50:18.401 --> 50:19.834
Miss Lyra...

50:20.903 --> 50:23.064
I'd like to give you
a word of advice...

50:23.105 --> 50:25.699
though you ain't asked for none.

50:25.741 --> 50:28.505
If I was on the kinda...scout...

50:28.544 --> 50:31.069
that I reckon you're on...

50:31.113 --> 50:34.378
I'd hire myself an aeronaut...

50:34.417 --> 50:36.009
and an armoured bear.

50:36.052 --> 50:38.179
An armoured bear?

50:38.220 --> 50:40.711
There's one in town.

50:40.756 --> 50:43.088
lorek Byrnison's his name.

50:43.125 --> 50:46.652
Works at the sled depot
behind Einarsson's Bar.

50:46.696 --> 50:49.426
Good one to have
on your side in a scrap.

50:50.566 --> 50:52.397
Not that you're lookin' for that.

51:03.879 --> 51:07.508
lorek Byrnison? lorek Byrnison?

51:07.550 --> 51:10.917
May I speak to you?

51:13.022 --> 51:14.114
What?

51:14.156 --> 51:16.488
We want to offer you employment.

51:16.525 --> 51:20.791
I am employed, by the townspeople.

51:20.830 --> 51:23.355
I mend broken machinery.

51:23.399 --> 51:26.391
I lift heavy objects.

51:26.435 --> 51:29.893
What kind of work is that
for a Panserbjørn?

51:31.974 --> 51:33.669
Paid work!

51:54.764 --> 51:56.959
Is that what they pay you?

51:56.999 --> 51:58.330
Whisky?

51:59.935 --> 52:01.266
lorek Byrnison...

52:01.303 --> 52:04.500
you're the first ice bear I ever met.

52:05.741 --> 52:08.209
I was ever so excited,
and scared.

52:09.412 --> 52:11.676
But now I'm just disappointed.

52:11.714 --> 52:14.512
I heard that bears
lived to hunt and to fight.

52:15.618 --> 52:17.677
Why are you
wasting your time here...

52:17.720 --> 52:19.210
drinking whisky?

52:21.023 --> 52:25.016
I stay because
the people of this town...

52:25.061 --> 52:26.619
gave me spirits...

52:26.662 --> 52:29.426
and let me drink till I was asleep.

52:29.465 --> 52:32.298
Then they took my armour away.

52:32.334 --> 52:35.531
And without my armour,
I cannot go to war.

52:35.571 --> 52:39.507
And I am an armoured bear.

52:39.542 --> 52:42.978
War is the sea I swim in...

52:43.012 --> 52:45.742
the air I breathe.

52:45.781 --> 52:49.581
Without my armour, I am nothing.

52:49.618 --> 52:53.577
But...can't you make new armour?

52:53.622 --> 52:56.682
I thought bears were good at that.

52:56.725 --> 52:58.590
There's all this metal around.

52:58.627 --> 53:00.595
Worthless!

53:02.364 --> 53:05.458
My armour is made of sky iron...

53:05.501 --> 53:09.494
from the falling stars
that land in Svalbard.

53:09.538 --> 53:12.974
A bear's armour is his soul...

53:13.008 --> 53:16.000
as your dæmon is your soul.

53:16.045 --> 53:17.603
Irreplaceable.

53:17.646 --> 53:21.207
You may as well take him away
and replace him with a doll.

53:22.952 --> 53:26.285
It must have been terrible
to lose your armour.

53:26.322 --> 53:29.257
It was no less than I deserved.

53:30.426 --> 53:32.291
I am an exile.

53:32.328 --> 53:37.322
I was sent away from Svalbard
because I was unworthy.

53:37.366 --> 53:40.699
I fought another bear
in single combat...

53:40.736 --> 53:43.432
and was defeated.

53:51.881 --> 53:54.315
- Come, child.
- But Farder Coram--

53:54.350 --> 53:56.443
We can't involve ourselves.

54:26.282 --> 54:28.250
He was a prince.

54:30.019 --> 54:33.477
He would have been a king
if the other bear hadn't defeated him.

54:33.522 --> 54:35.717
He lost everything.

54:35.758 --> 54:38.556
Oh, Pan, they've really hurt him.

54:41.931 --> 54:45.560
lorek Byrnison? lorek Byrnison.

54:46.936 --> 54:50.030
- Be careful.
- I know where your armour is.

54:52.541 --> 54:54.839
They tricked you out of it.

54:54.877 --> 54:56.845
They shouldn't have done that,
lorek Byrnison.

54:56.879 --> 55:01.248
It's in the district office
of the Magisterium.

55:01.283 --> 55:03.717
Right here in Trollesund.

55:03.752 --> 55:06.448
What is your name, child?

55:06.488 --> 55:08.251
Lyra Belacqua.

55:08.290 --> 55:11.851
Then, Lyra Belacqua...

55:11.894 --> 55:14.362
I owe you a debt.

55:14.396 --> 55:17.126
I will serve you in your campaign...

55:17.166 --> 55:19.293
until I am dead...

55:19.335 --> 55:22.566
or you have a victory.

56:18.327 --> 56:19.658
lorek!

56:20.763 --> 56:23.254
lorek Byrnison!

56:23.299 --> 56:26.757
lorek, listen.
Don't fight these men.

56:26.802 --> 56:28.929
What they done ain't right, I know.

56:28.971 --> 56:30.996
But if you fight, you'll kill them.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.405
And there'll be more fighting...

56:32.441 --> 56:34.375
and we'll never get away
to rescue those kids.

56:40.182 --> 56:42.582
Let's not be too hasty.

56:42.618 --> 56:45.951
Way I see it,
there's no need for a dust-up.

56:47.623 --> 56:51.024
Howdy, lorek.
I was down South.

56:51.060 --> 56:53.961
Heard you ran into
a little local trouble.

56:53.996 --> 56:57.397
Didn't have the first notion
on how to spring ya.

56:57.433 --> 56:58.923
Fortunately, little girls...

56:58.967 --> 57:01.197
come in real resourceful
up in these parts.

57:04.473 --> 57:07.704
Well, looky here. Reinforcements.

57:09.578 --> 57:12.741
What do you say you fellers
just call it a day?

57:16.885 --> 57:19.911
Just been hired on
by these gentlemen...

57:19.955 --> 57:22.890
of the Gyptian persuasion.

57:22.925 --> 57:25.416
You figurin' on joining
this turkey shoot?

57:25.461 --> 57:29.022
Yes. I have a contract
with the child.

57:31.767 --> 57:34.600
That's some pretty
fast work, Miss Lyra.

57:56.925 --> 57:58.916
My lord.

58:01.663 --> 58:04.757
Rise, Fra Pavel.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.597
I have received your news...

58:06.635 --> 58:11.038
about the Gyptian party
heading to the North.

58:11.073 --> 58:13.200
The matter is of
the first importance.

58:13.242 --> 58:16.609
They must be eliminated,
and Bolvangar protected.

58:18.046 --> 58:22.210
The intercision process is
more important than ever.

58:22.251 --> 58:25.084
Which is why it must be
taken out of the hands...

58:25.120 --> 58:27.418
of the Coulter woman.

58:31.260 --> 58:35.720
It was Mrs. Coulter
who took the Belacqua child...

58:35.764 --> 58:38.426
from Jordan College
and then let her slip away.

58:38.467 --> 58:41.459
Yes, that is
the most troubling of all.

58:42.704 --> 58:45.935
No matter.
One way or another...

58:45.974 --> 58:48.374
it's better that I've sent
Mrs. Coulter after the child.

58:48.410 --> 58:50.742
- You've sent her?
- Yes.

58:50.779 --> 58:53.145
She is to demonstrate
the improvements...

58:53.182 --> 58:57.050
to the intercision process
upon the Belacqua girl.

59:21.109 --> 59:23.839
I'm sorry.

59:30.552 --> 59:33.112
I would never hurt you.

59:39.228 --> 59:41.219
Oh, Lyra.

59:43.465 --> 59:46.059
I'll find you.

59:46.101 --> 59:48.865
I will find you.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.945
Careful now, boys.

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:11.551
Airship machinery's kind of finicky.

01:00:11.593 --> 01:00:15.051
I want to die in a rocking chair,
not a hydrogen fire.

01:00:15.097 --> 01:00:17.565
And she was ever so clever,
Mrs. Coulter...

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:19.590
but she was always
telling me what to do.

01:00:19.635 --> 01:00:21.660
I don't like people
telling me what to do.

01:00:21.703 --> 01:00:24.365
I bet you don't like it either.
I can tell.

01:00:24.406 --> 01:00:26.374
You're like my Uncle Asriel.

01:00:26.408 --> 01:00:29.502
He's a rough noble like you.
That's what I think.

01:00:36.685 --> 01:00:39.586
Samoyed lands.

01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:43.216
Samoyeds don't take
kindly to trespassers.

01:00:43.258 --> 01:00:46.352
It's the only way
to reach Bolvangar.

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:51.490
Stay close to me.

01:00:51.533 --> 01:00:54.559
- Come, child.
- It will be dark soon.

01:01:03.612 --> 01:01:06.080
How far do you reckon?

01:01:06.114 --> 01:01:08.776
Oh, I don't know for sure,
but a good few miles.

01:01:08.817 --> 01:01:11.547
We covered some ground.

01:01:33.508 --> 01:01:36.909
What's wrong?
What can you see?

01:01:42.884 --> 01:01:44.749
- Where are we going?
- Hush, Pan.

01:01:44.786 --> 01:01:46.686
They told us not to leave the tent.

01:01:46.722 --> 01:01:48.019
Is he coming, then?

01:01:48.056 --> 01:01:51.321
Don't know. I'll have a look.

01:02:07.209 --> 01:02:08.471
lorek?

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:11.445
What is it, child?

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.711
The alethiometer keeps
telling me something.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:18.277
In the next valley,
there's a lake with a house by it...

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.584
and it's troubled by a ghost.

01:02:20.622 --> 01:02:24.114
It's something to do
with the Gobblers and Roger.

01:02:24.159 --> 01:02:27.788
You could take me there,
couldn't you?

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:29.729
You could carry me
there and back...

01:02:29.765 --> 01:02:31.596
before anyone knew,
couldn't you?

01:02:32.467 --> 01:02:35.959
You wish to ride me?

01:02:36.004 --> 01:02:37.938
Yeah.

01:02:37.973 --> 01:02:41.101
We will travel faster without armour.

01:03:15.944 --> 01:03:18.139
Are those birds?

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.841
Witches.

01:03:21.483 --> 01:03:23.610
More than I have ever seen.

01:03:23.652 --> 01:03:25.643
Where are they going?

01:03:25.687 --> 01:03:28.485
Flying to war.

01:03:29.758 --> 01:03:31.851
If they are flying
to the aid of your enemies...

01:03:31.893 --> 01:03:34.123
you should all be afraid.

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.525
Are you afraid?

01:03:36.565 --> 01:03:38.362
No.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.063
When I am, I will master my fear.

01:04:10.432 --> 01:04:12.992
I will make sure the way is clear.

01:04:13.034 --> 01:04:15.696
No. Stay here.

01:04:37.559 --> 01:04:40.289
Lyra, no, please don't.

01:04:40.328 --> 01:04:42.296
Something's wrong.

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:45.788
- Hush, Pan.
- Something terrible.

01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:48.268
I'm afraid.

01:04:48.303 --> 01:04:50.863
We've got to master our fear.

01:05:12.694 --> 01:05:14.889
Hello?

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:16.921
Hello?

01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:43.519
Billy.

01:05:43.558 --> 01:05:45.924
Where's his dæmon?

01:05:45.961 --> 01:05:48.725
He doesn't have a dæmon.

01:05:48.763 --> 01:05:50.628
That's...

01:05:50.665 --> 01:05:52.326
intercision.

01:05:54.169 --> 01:05:56.933
That's what
the Gobblers are doing--

01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:02.001
cuttin' away kids' dæmons.

01:06:03.378 --> 01:06:05.278
Where's my Ratter?

01:06:05.313 --> 01:06:07.338
Have you seen her?

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:11.385
Billy, it's me, Lyra.

01:06:11.419 --> 01:06:14.388
Let me take you
back to your mum.

01:06:14.422 --> 01:06:16.481
I need Ratter.

01:06:16.524 --> 01:06:19.186
Billy, come on with me.

01:06:19.227 --> 01:06:21.354
We'll take you someplace safe.

01:06:21.396 --> 01:06:23.057
We'll find Ratter.

01:06:39.748 --> 01:06:42.216
Gracious God, what's this?

01:06:44.619 --> 01:06:48.180
Lyra, child,
what have you found?

01:06:48.223 --> 01:06:51.886
Billy. Billy Costa.

01:06:51.927 --> 01:06:53.360
Billy!

01:06:56.598 --> 01:06:58.759
Oh, Billy!
You're all right, Billy.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.030
You're safe now.

01:07:01.937 --> 01:07:03.165
We'll find your dæmon.

01:07:03.204 --> 01:07:06.037
We'll bring 'er back.

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:25.892
Here, take Lyra.
Gyptians, to arms!

01:07:35.136 --> 01:07:37.001
- Watch your backs!
- Protect the children!

01:07:50.085 --> 01:07:51.780
Look out, Lyra!

01:08:02.163 --> 01:08:03.824
lorek!

01:08:04.199 --> 01:08:06.963
lorek Byrnison, help me!

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.848
Pan, where are they taking us?

01:08:27.889 --> 01:08:29.857
I don't know.
We've been going for hours.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:45.439
Ice bears, Pan.

01:08:47.509 --> 01:08:49.670
I hope you're happy now.

01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:06.957
You're losing your touch, amigo.

01:09:07.796 --> 01:09:09.286
So am I.

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:11.729
Don't worry.

01:09:11.765 --> 01:09:13.461
We'll get her back.

01:09:14.736 --> 01:09:18.136
The Samoyeds
won't lay a hand on her.

01:09:18.173 --> 01:09:20.607
She's worth more in one piece.

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:26.274
I'll find her.

01:09:26.314 --> 01:09:29.805
I'll bring her back.
I can bargain with Ragnar.

01:09:31.386 --> 01:09:34.651
I'll drop you at the border,
pick you up on the way out.

01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:37.658
No. I will not leave her.

01:09:40.194 --> 01:09:42.254
You show up in Svalbard...

01:09:42.296 --> 01:09:44.287
Ragnar and the rest of 'em
will tear you to pieces.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:45.890
You know that.

01:09:45.934 --> 01:09:47.959
I know I would feel ashamed...

01:09:48.002 --> 01:09:50.698
to show less courage
than that child.

01:09:50.738 --> 01:09:53.764
That kind of courage
could get you killed.

01:09:53.808 --> 01:09:58.040
I will not live in shame
any longer, Scoresby.

01:09:59.547 --> 01:10:01.208
No.

01:10:02.484 --> 01:10:04.475
I reckon not.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.621
I'm gonna take her down,
pick up the trail.

01:10:16.798 --> 01:10:18.766
Don't worry. lorek will come.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.863
That's just it, Pan.
There's too many of them for him to fight.

01:10:29.177 --> 01:10:31.270
We've got to do something.

01:10:34.949 --> 01:10:39.386
Do you remember
what Mrs. Coulter said back at Jordan...

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.548
about the king of the bears
wanting a dæmon?

01:10:45.293 --> 01:10:47.955
Pan, I need you to hide.

01:10:47.996 --> 01:10:51.295
- Don't let them see you.
- That's fine with me.

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:54.062
We can beat him, Pan.

01:11:05.747 --> 01:11:08.841
What is this little thing?

01:11:10.151 --> 01:11:13.279
Our greetings to you, great king.

01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:17.348
Or rather, my greetings and not his.

01:11:17.392 --> 01:11:19.587
Not whose?

01:11:19.627 --> 01:11:22.425
lorek Byrnison's, Your Majesty.

01:11:22.463 --> 01:11:26.991
What have you
to do with lorek Byrnison?

01:11:30.171 --> 01:11:32.605
I am lorek Byrnison's dæmon.

01:11:35.877 --> 01:11:38.277
And how has the exile...

01:11:38.313 --> 01:11:42.044
the unworthy lorek Byrnison,
obtained a dæmon?

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:45.109
lorek Byrnison was
the first bear to get a dæmon...

01:11:45.153 --> 01:11:46.882
but it should've been you.

01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:50.721
They gave me to him at Bolvangar.
Mrs. Coulter did.

01:11:50.758 --> 01:11:54.455
And how could you be
so far from him?

01:11:54.495 --> 01:11:56.963
I'm like a witch's dæmon, great king.

01:11:56.998 --> 01:12:00.729
- I can go as far from him as I please.
- Well...

01:12:00.768 --> 01:12:02.702
if you are his dæmon...

01:12:02.737 --> 01:12:06.696
then I will kill you right now
and be free of an enemy.

01:12:06.741 --> 01:12:09.301
If you do that,
I can never be your dæmon.

01:12:10.245 --> 01:12:12.805
My...dæmon?

01:12:12.847 --> 01:12:15.179
That's why I come here, see?

01:12:15.216 --> 01:12:17.684
'Cause I want to be
your dæmon, not his.

01:12:17.719 --> 01:12:20.711
He's just an exile, nothing.

01:12:20.755 --> 01:12:24.282
But you, you're powerful
and clever and rich...

01:12:24.325 --> 01:12:27.522
and better in every way.

01:12:27.562 --> 01:12:30.588
He's on his way here now,
to fight you.

01:12:30.632 --> 01:12:33.465
What? He's mad.

01:12:33.501 --> 01:12:35.992
- We shall destroy him!
- No.

01:12:36.037 --> 01:12:37.527
No.

01:12:38.273 --> 01:12:41.504
If you defeat him,
I will become your dæmon.

01:12:41.542 --> 01:12:44.272
But you must defeat him
in single combat.

01:12:44.312 --> 01:12:48.248
Then all his strength
will flow into yours...

01:12:48.283 --> 01:12:52.617
and my mind will flow
into your mind.

01:12:52.654 --> 01:12:55.088
You and me, together.

01:12:57.158 --> 01:12:59.592
Have him killed any other way...

01:12:59.627 --> 01:13:02.755
and I'll just go out like a light,
and you'll never have a dæmon.

01:13:02.797 --> 01:13:05.095
Prove it.

01:13:05.133 --> 01:13:08.398
Prove to me that you are a dæmon.

01:13:08.436 --> 01:13:10.996
Ask me something only you know.

01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:16.602
How did I become king?

01:13:25.853 --> 01:13:27.844
What is that?

01:13:27.889 --> 01:13:30.255
It's a dæmon mirror, great king.

01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:34.091
We dæmons use it to see
the truth in our own eyes.

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:59.481
Truly you are great
and powerful, Ragnar...

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.988
for you poisoned the old king...

01:14:02.023 --> 01:14:05.550
then challenged the heir to the throne
and beat him in single combat.

01:14:08.096 --> 01:14:10.326
lorek Byrnison.

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.581
Oh, Pan, what have I done?

01:14:34.622 --> 01:14:36.351
Ragnar's too strong.

01:14:42.163 --> 01:14:44.290
So here he is.

01:14:44.332 --> 01:14:47.028
But what if the coward
dare not fight me?

01:14:47.068 --> 01:14:50.003
Great king, let me speak to him.

01:14:50.037 --> 01:14:52.665
- If I do, he will not suspect.
- Very well.

01:14:52.707 --> 01:14:55.403
You go to him. Give him courage.

01:14:55.443 --> 01:14:58.003
Bring him to his death.

01:14:58.045 --> 01:15:00.946
Soon you'll be mine.

01:15:13.327 --> 01:15:15.124
Oh, lorek.

01:15:15.163 --> 01:15:17.893
lorek, dear,
I've done a terrible thing.

01:15:17.932 --> 01:15:21.368
What terrible thing?

01:15:23.504 --> 01:15:26.996
I told the king I was your dæmon
and that he must fight you.

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:29.009
If not, they would never let you fight.

01:15:29.043 --> 01:15:31.068
They would burn you
before you even got up close.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.872
But you've been fighting...

01:15:33.915 --> 01:15:35.746
and running all this way.

01:15:35.783 --> 01:15:39.651
Lyra. Lyra Belacqua.

01:15:39.687 --> 01:15:44.021
No, I shall call you
Lyra Silvertongue.

01:15:44.058 --> 01:15:47.721
To fight him is all I want.

01:15:47.762 --> 01:15:50.754
Come, little dæmon.

01:15:58.973 --> 01:16:00.941
Fight well, lorek, my dear.

01:16:00.975 --> 01:16:03.239
You're the real king,
and he ain't nothing.

01:16:03.277 --> 01:16:06.474
Lyra, if I am killed...

01:16:06.514 --> 01:16:08.607
Scoresby will find you.

01:17:51.586 --> 01:17:53.918
Is that all...

01:17:53.955 --> 01:17:55.513
whimpering cub?

01:17:55.556 --> 01:17:57.649
Is that all...

01:17:57.692 --> 01:17:59.319
soon-to-die?

01:18:01.429 --> 01:18:05.024
Is that all? Huh?

01:18:14.809 --> 01:18:17.039
Is that all?

01:18:38.666 --> 01:18:41.533
Yes, that is all.

01:18:41.569 --> 01:18:44.504
That is all.

01:18:44.538 --> 01:18:50.204
Bears, who is your king?

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.091
lorek...

01:19:08.129 --> 01:19:10.723
lorek, I thought I'd lost you.

01:19:10.765 --> 01:19:12.289
Why?

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:14.995
You still own my contract.

01:19:17.738 --> 01:19:21.003
And now I will take you to Bolvangar.

01:19:25.346 --> 01:19:27.211
We've got to stop them, lorek.

01:19:27.248 --> 01:19:29.341
The alethiometer says
they'll hurt Roger.

01:19:53.174 --> 01:19:54.641
There.

01:20:12.259 --> 01:20:14.591
It may not hold us both.

01:20:15.362 --> 01:20:18.058
You cross on your own.
I will follow.

01:20:27.608 --> 01:20:30.304
I'm right here. Step quickly.

01:20:30.344 --> 01:20:32.335
Don't look down.

01:20:49.063 --> 01:20:52.157
Don't look back!
You're almost there.

01:21:08.816 --> 01:21:10.579
Run, Lyra!

01:21:10.618 --> 01:21:12.916
Run! Run!

01:21:20.928 --> 01:21:24.193
Lyra! I will get
Scoresby and the Gyptians.

01:21:27.468 --> 01:21:29.527
Wait for me there!

01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:32.403
Lyra! Wait!

01:21:45.286 --> 01:21:47.618
I don't like the look of this place.

01:21:53.561 --> 01:21:55.756
Bolvangar.

01:21:55.796 --> 01:21:57.991
Hello, there.

01:21:58.032 --> 01:22:01.934
I got lost in the snow. Where am I?

01:22:01.969 --> 01:22:03.869
No need to worry, my child.

01:22:03.904 --> 01:22:05.804
You're safe now.

01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:15.615
Well, you'd better come inside.

01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:17.583
It's warm and comfortable in here.

01:22:17.618 --> 01:22:21.019
- What's your name?
- Don't tell him who we are.

01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:25.423
Lizzie. Lizzie Brooks.

01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:31.097
What were you doing
so far north, Lizzie?

01:22:31.131 --> 01:22:33.292
That must be an interesting story.

01:22:33.334 --> 01:22:36.360
My dad and uncles,
they took me north.

01:22:36.403 --> 01:22:38.371
They're traders.

01:22:38.405 --> 01:22:42.739
Well, you're very lucky
to have found us when you got lost.

01:22:42.776 --> 01:22:44.368
What is this place?

01:22:44.411 --> 01:22:46.902
Oh, you'll like it.

01:22:46.947 --> 01:22:49.472
It's called the Experimental Station.

01:22:49.516 --> 01:22:51.381
What do you do here?

01:22:51.418 --> 01:22:53.352
We help children grow up.

01:22:53.387 --> 01:22:56.652
- Liar.
- You must be hungry, Lizzie. Lucky you.

01:22:56.690 --> 01:22:58.988
Just in time for dinner.

01:23:14.975 --> 01:23:17.205
Can you see him?
Is he here?

01:23:32.726 --> 01:23:34.193
- Lyra, it's them.
- Pan!

01:23:34.228 --> 01:23:35.991
- You found us!
- You're all right!

01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:38.624
You kept your promise!

01:23:49.877 --> 01:23:51.435
I knew you'd come.

01:23:51.478 --> 01:23:53.105
I promised, didn't I?

01:24:00.921 --> 01:24:04.482
Roger, do you know
what they do to the kids here?

01:24:05.859 --> 01:24:08.521
They say they're gonna give us
this operation, right?

01:24:08.562 --> 01:24:10.291
Then they'll send us home...

01:24:10.331 --> 01:24:12.128
and we won't have
to worry about Dust.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.193
But once they call a kid in...

01:24:15.235 --> 01:24:16.930
you'll never see them again.

01:24:16.971 --> 01:24:19.769
They took Billy Costa
away last week...

01:24:19.807 --> 01:24:21.172
and he's still gone.

01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:24.405
Don't worry.
I've got a plan, all right?

01:24:26.447 --> 01:24:29.883
Tell the kids to have
their warm clothes ready.

01:24:29.917 --> 01:24:31.976
I need to be alone someplace.

01:24:33.087 --> 01:24:34.782
But not here.

01:24:38.258 --> 01:24:41.250
They hardly ever use this one,
but be quick.

01:24:58.645 --> 01:25:00.738
Ask it how
we're gonna get out of here.

01:25:04.018 --> 01:25:05.986
But why would it--

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.045
Oh, no. It's them.

01:25:08.088 --> 01:25:09.680
I think you'll be pleased with our progress.

01:25:09.723 --> 01:25:13.352
That may be so,
but I am very interested in discovering...

01:25:13.394 --> 01:25:16.886
how several children managed
to wander free from the station.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.127
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Coulter...

01:25:21.168 --> 01:25:23.659
I hope you'll understand
that the question is moot.

01:25:23.704 --> 01:25:26.400
Any child who escapes
from the facility...

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.533
would not last
very long in the cold.

01:25:28.575 --> 01:25:31.476
We have already recovered
two of the three missing children.

01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:33.707
Were they alive?

01:25:38.352 --> 01:25:40.650
Well, that is unfortunate.

01:25:41.522 --> 01:25:43.387
But enough of that for now.

01:25:43.424 --> 01:25:45.585
I, at least, have some good news.

01:25:47.594 --> 01:25:50.563
We needn't be concerned
with Lord Asriel any longer.

01:25:53.167 --> 01:25:56.193
He has bribed his captors
and set up a secret laboratory...

01:25:56.236 --> 01:25:58.796
in the furthest reaches
of the North.

01:26:00.707 --> 01:26:04.108
The Magisterium soldiers
are on their way.

01:26:04.144 --> 01:26:08.205
He will be arrested for heresy
and sentenced to death.

01:26:08.248 --> 01:26:10.580
Put him to death? Dear me.

01:26:13.587 --> 01:26:16.488
I think I will retire for the evening.

01:26:16.523 --> 01:26:18.491
Oh, well, yes, of course.

01:26:18.525 --> 01:26:20.993
The orderlies will show you
to your chambers.

01:26:25.566 --> 01:26:27.898
Wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her. I tell you that.

01:26:27.935 --> 01:26:30.563
She's positively ghoulish.

01:26:30.604 --> 01:26:32.731
Do you remember
the first experiments...

01:26:32.773 --> 01:26:35.037
when she was so keen
to see them pulled apart?

01:26:35.075 --> 01:26:37.543
Her and that mute of a dæmon.

01:26:37.578 --> 01:26:39.170
- What was that?
- Down there.

01:26:39.213 --> 01:26:40.544
- Under the table.
- Quick!

01:26:40.581 --> 01:26:42.515
- Lyra!
- Grab her leg!

01:26:42.549 --> 01:26:43.607
Lyra, they've got me!

01:26:45.319 --> 01:26:46.616
Come here.

01:26:46.653 --> 01:26:48.587
- Come on.
- Lyra!

01:26:50.591 --> 01:26:52.388
- You can't!
- Let me go! Get off me!

01:26:52.426 --> 01:26:54.860
You're not allowed!

01:26:56.263 --> 01:26:58.128
Lyra!

01:27:04.738 --> 01:27:06.501
Quickly now. Straight into the chamber.

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.338
Let me go. lorek Byrnison's gonna kill you.

01:27:09.376 --> 01:27:11.571
- He'll rip your guts out!
- What a--

01:27:12.913 --> 01:27:16.440
Don't fret, dear.
It's only a little cut.

01:27:16.483 --> 01:27:19.782
- You'll never keep us apart.
- You want to grow up, don't you?

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.914
- Well, this is how you grow up.
- Stay away from me!

01:27:22.956 --> 01:27:26.016
- You'll never keep us apart!
- Set phase two.

01:27:26.059 --> 01:27:28.118
Never, never!

01:27:33.233 --> 01:27:34.928
No, stop!

01:27:34.968 --> 01:27:37.095
- Lyra!
- Pan!

01:27:37.137 --> 01:27:39.503
- No!
- Never!

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.706
You can't!

01:27:45.145 --> 01:27:46.976
- Don't leave me, Pan.
- No!

01:27:47.014 --> 01:27:49.312
- Stop!
- No! Help me!

01:27:49.349 --> 01:27:51.010
Lyra!

01:27:55.889 --> 01:27:57.982
Lyra!

01:28:27.621 --> 01:28:29.714
Lyra. Darling.

01:28:29.756 --> 01:28:31.747
- Don't. Don't you touch.
- No, no. No, no one will hurt you.

01:28:31.792 --> 01:28:34.920
No one is going to hurt you.
No one is ever...

01:28:34.962 --> 01:28:36.657
ever going to hurt you.

01:28:36.697 --> 01:28:40.497
They did it to Billy...

01:28:40.534 --> 01:28:42.559
and those other kids.

01:28:42.603 --> 01:28:45.299
They cut their dæmons away.

01:28:45.339 --> 01:28:48.399
Why? Why are they doing that?

01:28:48.442 --> 01:28:52.378
I know it's difficult to understand,
but it's for their own good.

01:28:52.412 --> 01:28:54.539
It's just a little cut.

01:28:54.581 --> 01:28:58.517
You listen. Listen to me.

01:28:58.552 --> 01:29:00.918
A long, long time ago...

01:29:00.954 --> 01:29:03.445
some of our ancestors made--

01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:05.788
made a terrible mistake.

01:29:05.826 --> 01:29:08.522
They disobeyed...

01:29:08.562 --> 01:29:10.757
the Authority.

01:29:10.797 --> 01:29:14.028
And that is what made Dust
come into the world.

01:29:14.067 --> 01:29:17.833
And ever since then, we have been sick
with it, we have been sick with Dust.

01:29:17.871 --> 01:29:20.135
But there is a way out.

01:29:20.173 --> 01:29:22.835
You see, Dust doesn't settle
on innocent children.

01:29:24.177 --> 01:29:28.511
It's later, when your dæmon
begins to settle...

01:29:28.548 --> 01:29:31.278
that Dust begins
to swarm all around us...

01:29:31.318 --> 01:29:34.879
trying to work its mischief.

01:29:34.921 --> 01:29:38.288
And that is how children begin to have
all sorts of nasty thoughts...

01:29:38.325 --> 01:29:40.850
and unhappy feelings and--

01:29:42.462 --> 01:29:44.862
But there is a way to stop it.

01:29:46.266 --> 01:29:49.861
A little cut, and gone forever.

01:29:49.903 --> 01:29:53.236
Well, if it's so good,
then why don't you do it yourself?

01:29:53.273 --> 01:29:55.104
Why didn't you let them do it to me?

01:29:57.577 --> 01:30:00.705
I'm going to tell you something.

01:30:00.747 --> 01:30:04.012
Something very important,
something you don't know.

01:30:04.051 --> 01:30:06.542
Intercision isn't perfect yet...

01:30:06.586 --> 01:30:09.020
and you're not just anyone, Lyra.

01:30:09.056 --> 01:30:13.390
Your mother didn't die
in an airship accident as you were told.

01:30:13.427 --> 01:30:17.295
She wasn't married to your father,
and even though--

01:30:17.331 --> 01:30:20.926
even though she loved you
very much and...

01:30:20.967 --> 01:30:22.901
and she wanted to keep you...

01:30:24.771 --> 01:30:26.432
it wasn't allowed.

01:30:28.141 --> 01:30:31.269
And so you were taken from her.

01:30:31.311 --> 01:30:35.441
And it wasn't until things changed...

01:30:35.482 --> 01:30:38.212
and she was free to do
as she wanted, that...

01:30:41.021 --> 01:30:44.047
that she went to Jordan College
and she spoke to the Master.

01:30:44.091 --> 01:30:46.559
No! You can't be!

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.229
Yes, Lyra, you're mine.

01:30:57.270 --> 01:31:00.171
And you're safe with me.

01:31:00.207 --> 01:31:03.176
You'll always be safe with me.

01:31:05.946 --> 01:31:08.039
Who's my father?

01:31:15.188 --> 01:31:18.680
Lord Asriel.
He's my father, isn't he?

01:31:21.228 --> 01:31:24.527
Yes. Yes.

01:31:34.408 --> 01:31:36.433
Now I almost forgot.

01:31:36.476 --> 01:31:40.776
The Master of Jordan
gave you something, didn't he?

01:31:40.814 --> 01:31:43.874
He gave you an alethiometer,
didn't he?

01:31:45.452 --> 01:31:47.283
But you see...

01:31:48.622 --> 01:31:51.318
it wasn't really his to give.

01:31:53.393 --> 01:31:55.452
Ah, he did. Oh.

01:31:55.495 --> 01:31:59.591
Must've seemed such a puzzle, what
a silly old thing like that was any good for.

01:32:00.634 --> 01:32:02.693
All right.

01:32:05.472 --> 01:32:07.565
Here it is.

01:32:07.607 --> 01:32:09.268
Thank you.

01:32:11.678 --> 01:32:14.511
What a funny old tin. Did you--

01:32:14.548 --> 01:32:17.540
did you put it in here
to keep it safe?

01:32:40.907 --> 01:32:42.966
Run! Lyra, let's go! Go!

01:32:44.077 --> 01:32:46.637
We're just not used to that reaction.

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.376
Understand this, Sister Clara,
they're not registered--

01:34:09.095 --> 01:34:11.529
Go on, then. Go on.

01:34:37.591 --> 01:34:40.287
lorek! lorek!

01:34:41.261 --> 01:34:42.660
Run, child!

01:34:45.832 --> 01:34:48.130
Let's go! Come on!

01:34:56.276 --> 01:34:58.039
- Quickly!
- Let's go!

01:35:15.996 --> 01:35:19.090
You'd better not touch me.
I'm warning you.

01:35:27.607 --> 01:35:29.734
Serafina Pekkala?

01:36:07.847 --> 01:36:10.714
- This way.
- Get out! Get out!

01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:12.615
- Mrs. Coulter!
- Get her up.

01:36:12.652 --> 01:36:14.813
Come!

01:36:17.323 --> 01:36:19.382
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

01:36:39.045 --> 01:36:41.138
Charge!

01:36:41.181 --> 01:36:42.910
Come on! Run!

01:37:00.633 --> 01:37:02.931
Come on! Get down, men!

01:37:02.969 --> 01:37:05.767
Mr. Scoresby, help lorek!

01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:37.830
Come on!

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:27.513
Joe! Oh, my precious!

01:38:27.554 --> 01:38:30.352
- Dad!
- Oh, my goodness, boy!

01:38:32.058 --> 01:38:33.548
- Darling!
- Mum!

01:38:33.593 --> 01:38:35.322
Here's my daughter! Come here!

01:38:41.601 --> 01:38:44.695
Gyptians! To me!

01:38:44.737 --> 01:38:46.830
We're going home!

01:38:49.843 --> 01:38:52.778
Lyra, we've got to go.

01:38:52.812 --> 01:38:54.712
It's time to go home.

01:38:55.748 --> 01:38:57.443
I can't, Roger.

01:38:57.483 --> 01:39:00.350
I've got to go to my father
and bring him the alethiometer.

01:39:00.386 --> 01:39:03.082
- Your father?
- Lord Asriel--

01:39:03.122 --> 01:39:05.750
Mrs. Coulter and them--
they're gonna kill him.

01:39:05.792 --> 01:39:07.191
Then I'm going too.

01:39:07.227 --> 01:39:11.186
You said you was gonna
come and get me. You got me.

01:39:17.770 --> 01:39:21.536
Miss Lyra, are you ready to fly?

01:39:24.344 --> 01:39:26.335
I know where she's going.

01:39:40.693 --> 01:39:44.322
Well, they're all tucked in back there.

01:39:44.364 --> 01:39:46.889
That little girl's somethin', huh?

01:39:51.604 --> 01:39:54.505
There's a prophesy
about that child, Mr. Scoresby.

01:39:56.309 --> 01:39:59.073
She will decide the war
which is to come.

01:39:59.112 --> 01:40:00.477
War?

01:40:02.215 --> 01:40:04.740
I ain't heard rumor of any war.

01:40:04.784 --> 01:40:07.048
You will.

01:40:07.086 --> 01:40:10.749
It is your war too,
whether you know it or not.

01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:14.920
- What would the quarrel be about?
- Nothing less than free will.

01:40:16.062 --> 01:40:20.590
The Magisterium not only seeks to
control everyone in this world...

01:40:20.633 --> 01:40:23.101
but every world in every universe.

01:40:25.905 --> 01:40:28.897
They've been unable
to extend their power until now.

01:40:29.442 --> 01:40:33.139
But if Asriel finds
a way to travel between worlds...

01:40:33.179 --> 01:40:36.945
nothing will stop them
from trying to take over.

01:40:36.983 --> 01:40:38.951
Nothing but us...

01:40:38.985 --> 01:40:41.010
and that child.

01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:53.089
What's it telling you?

01:41:07.447 --> 01:41:09.347
It's telling me about my father.

01:41:10.383 --> 01:41:13.648
It says I'm bringing him
what he needs.

01:41:13.686 --> 01:41:15.881
We're going home, aren't we, Lyra?

01:41:15.922 --> 01:41:17.617
After we save your father.

01:41:19.592 --> 01:41:21.253
Course.

01:41:21.294 --> 01:41:24.627
'Cept, first we gotta sort out
some things that need sorting.

01:41:24.664 --> 01:41:28.794
Like Billy and them other kids that lost
their dæmons. We've got to help them.

01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:31.159
And it isn't like the Magisterium's...

01:41:31.204 --> 01:41:33.729
just gonna let us go home to Jordan
just like that...

01:41:33.773 --> 01:41:35.968
or leave off ordering people about.

01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:39.337
And Dust--

01:41:39.379 --> 01:41:41.006
I want to know what Dust is.

01:41:42.281 --> 01:41:45.614
Maybe we're supposed to go to that other
world with my father and find out.

01:41:45.651 --> 01:41:47.949
That's an awful lot to sort out.

01:41:47.987 --> 01:41:49.682
Well, who else is gonna do it?

01:41:49.722 --> 01:41:52.316
'Sides, we're in this together now.

01:41:52.358 --> 01:41:54.553
Yeah, suppose we are.

01:41:56.329 --> 01:41:59.992
You reckon it would do any harm
to get some sleep now?

01:42:00.033 --> 01:42:01.125
Go on, then.

01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:13.240
We'll set things right.

01:42:13.279 --> 01:42:15.645
We will.

01:42:15.681 --> 01:42:18.081
You and me...

01:42:18.117 --> 01:42:19.948
and lorek.

01:42:19.986 --> 01:42:22.477
And Serafina Pekkala
and Mr. Scoresby.

01:42:24.724 --> 01:42:26.055
And my father.

01:42:26.826 --> 01:42:28.691
We'll set it right, Pan.

01:42:31.097 --> 01:42:33.088
Just let them try to stop us.

01:43:17.977 --> 01:43:21.344
# Where are our lives #

01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:24.611
# If there is no dream? #

01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:29.747
# Where is our home? #

01:43:29.789 --> 01:43:33.520
# We don't know how #

01:43:33.559 --> 01:43:37.017
# There will be a way #

01:43:37.063 --> 01:43:40.260
# Out of the storm #

01:43:40.299 --> 01:43:47.933
# We will find hope #

01:43:55.815 --> 01:44:02.983
# And her soul
walks beside her #

01:44:03.022 --> 01:44:09.450
# An army stands behind her #

01:44:09.495 --> 01:44:14.330
# Lyra #

01:44:14.367 --> 01:44:16.562

01:44:20.439 --> 01:44:23.374
# Full of grace #

01:44:23.409 --> 01:44:27.436
# Two worlds
collide around her #

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:33.544
# The truth lies
deep inside her #

01:44:33.586 --> 01:44:38.649
# Lyra #

01:44:38.691 --> 01:44:41.182
# Lyra #

01:44:41.227 --> 01:44:47.723
# And the stars
look down upon her #

01:44:47.767 --> 01:44:54.036
# This darkness settles on her #

01:44:54.073 --> 01:44:59.010
# Lyra #

01:44:59.045 --> 01:45:01.240

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.913
# Who's to know
what's in the future? #

01:45:07.954 --> 01:45:11.856
# Every hope
we will be with her #

01:45:11.891 --> 01:45:17.852
# We have all our love
to give her #

01:45:17.897 --> 01:45:23.028
# Oh, Lyra #
