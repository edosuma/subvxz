I'm just a new driver

11:56.258 --> 11:58.635
in the middle of
the worst night of my life.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.139
I guess I would have recognized
the three of you if we had met.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.515
What?

12:04.141 --> 12:05.517
You and your boobs.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.270
What?! What happened?!

12:08.270 --> 12:11.481
My STD. Shock therapy device.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.985
It's this experimental new

12:14.985 --> 12:17.613
electroshock treatment for guys like me.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.115
This sucker is programed

12:20.115 --> 12:22.868
with 10,000 problematic words and phrases.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.245
If I utter one of them, it blasts me

12:25.245 --> 12:27.998
with enough electricity
to power Staten Island.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.460
Whoa. And that really works?

12:31.460 --> 12:33.337
Uh, yeah.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.464
When I first saw you, I wanted to say,

12:35.464 --> 12:38.050
"You rear-ended me,
so how about I rear-end you?"

12:42.930 --> 12:43.972
But I didn't.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.683
Well, uh, fun chat.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.520
What do you say
I Venmo you for the damage?

12:49.520 --> 12:52.564
What do you think's fair?
Like, 30... 40 bucks?

12:54.983 --> 12:56.860
Okay, 50! Final offer!

12:56.860 --> 13:00.197
Honey, my left shoelace cost $50.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.407
This is a new low.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.369
First, I find out I'm dating my maybe dad,

13:05.369 --> 13:08.163
and now I'm gonna go bankrupt
because I crashed into

13:08.163 --> 13:10.332
the fanciest perv in New York.

13:10.332 --> 13:13.210
I'm sorry. You just found out you're
maybe dating your maybe what? Who? What?

13:13.210 --> 13:15.003
It's a long story.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.299
How about you tell me

13:19.299 --> 13:23.262
your twisted tale of
daughter-daddy lust and intrigue,

13:23.262 --> 13:26.849
and if your story is juicy enough,
the car is on me.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.270
Really?
That's a... pretty weird challenge.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.855
If there's one thing
you should know about me,

13:32.855 --> 13:34.398
it's that I love a weird challenge.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.149
Okay.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.819
So, my friend and I,
we went to this party.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.070
- Okay.
- And I met a chef...

13:40.070 --> 13:42.322
Yeah, you did.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.743
Come on!

13:51.665 --> 13:53.166
Thank you for meeting me here.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.794
Stop being weird. We literally
just walked into another room.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.548
This receipt has a love song
written on it.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.841
About Sophie.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.051
- Yeah.
- When did you write it?

14:03.051 --> 14:06.263
Oh god, a long, long time ago.
I barely remember.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.390
Oh, you wrote it last week.

14:08.390 --> 14:12.311
Same day you bought three
extra-extra-large shirts at Gap Kids.

14:12.769 --> 14:16.231
Kids' clothes are just cheaper, okay?
And, yes, I wrote it last week.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.233
And, yes,
I still have feelings for Sophie.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.403
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.614
I mean, there was a minute there
where I thought about telling her,

14:23.614 --> 14:25.782
but then she got with Robert,
and I realized it's for the best.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.701
I mean, it was a complete disaster
the first time around.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.786
It would probably be a disaster again,

14:29.786 --> 14:31.288
and I just need to move on.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.209
So, let's just both forget
you ever found that song.

14:35.209 --> 14:37.211
Like Sid did when
he found my poem about...

14:38.295 --> 14:39.755
about Hillary Clinton.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.427
Deal.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.846
Thank you.

14:58.690 --> 15:02.027
Then I jumped in my rental car,
called my mom,

15:02.027 --> 15:04.279
and then crashed into you.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.576
Oh, thank God!

15:10.160 --> 15:11.912
"That's not your dad in the picture.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.623
I did buy ecstasy from him, though. Yum."

15:14.623 --> 15:15.999
She sounds fun.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.292
She is.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.503
Oh my god, that's so great.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.505
He's not my dad!

15:23.048 --> 15:26.468
He's just another great guy
that I ran away from

15:26.468 --> 15:29.763
because I'm a complete mess. Woo.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.226
When you were little,

15:34.226 --> 15:37.062
who did you picture
when you were imagining him?

15:38.522 --> 15:41.400
Bryan Cranston.
From <i>Malcolm in the Middle.</i>

15:41.400 --> 15:43.777
Not <i>Breaking Bad</i>.
I couldn't even watch that.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.654
I didn't wanna see my dad cooking meth.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.616
For me, it was Bob Barker.

15:50.325 --> 15:53.161
I always dreamed that one day,
he'd pull up outside my school,

15:53.161 --> 15:55.664
and we'd go spay and neuter pets together.

15:55.664 --> 15:56.915
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.002
So, you don't know your dad either?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.962
Actually, now I do.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.716
A great friend of mine
lost his father a while back.

16:05.716 --> 16:09.094
And so, I decided to track down
my own before it was too late.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.598
Did you ever think about finding yours?

16:12.598 --> 16:14.474
Of course.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.644
But then, I worry that
he's gonna be a criminal.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.396
Or a drunk.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.065
Or a prop comic.
- Ew.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.071
And then other times, I think that he...

16:28.655 --> 16:31.491
could be everything
that's ever been missing from my life

16:31.491 --> 16:33.243
and completely transform me

16:33.243 --> 16:36.538
into the best version
of myself that I could be.

16:37.289 --> 16:40.834
Fix your abandonment issues,
your commitment issues,

16:40.834 --> 16:43.962
your "not seeing women
as human being" issues.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.090
- Did your dad do all of that for you?
- Ha.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.134
No. Uh,

16:49.134 --> 16:51.136
actually, a few years back,

16:51.136 --> 16:54.139
a really amazing girl came into my life.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.810
My daughter Ellie.

17:00.312 --> 17:03.982
She is the best thing that ever
happened to an idiot like me.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.402
The moment I saw her, I knew...

17:08.362 --> 17:09.696
I had to change.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.324
Don't get me wrong.

17:12.783 --> 17:14.576
My dad is great.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.454
He's kind and funny,

17:17.454 --> 17:19.831
and watching the two of them
together, it just...

17:22.167 --> 17:24.002
You get it.

17:25.796 --> 17:26.922
Yeah.

17:29.967 --> 17:33.262
Look, if you ever do decide
to track down your dad,

17:34.388 --> 17:37.266
it probably won't fix all your problems.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.061
But, if you get lucky, like I did,

17:42.312 --> 17:43.355
could be great.

17:49.361 --> 17:53.198
So was my story juicy enough for you,
or are you gonna make me pay?

17:54.825 --> 17:55.951
You're off the hook.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.871
You don't have to Venmo me anything.

17:59.621 --> 18:03.166
Or, as my past self used to say,
you don't have to Ven-hoe me any--

18:04.835 --> 18:07.379
I said past self!

18:27.608 --> 18:28.984
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.819
Mm!

18:30.819 --> 18:33.155
How was your flight?
- Uh, you know, the usual.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.991
You hungry? I ordered from
that Thai place that you love.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.202
And I got two mango sticky rices this time

18:38.202 --> 18:40.204
because I learned from my mistakes.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.546
Hey.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.964
Robert!

18:50.964 --> 18:52.341
What are you doing here?

18:52.341 --> 18:56.011
I'm looking for you
to make sure you're okay

18:56.011 --> 18:58.722
'cause you jumped out the window
and fled my house.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.641
Oh. Right.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.813
The picture you showed me
from Lollapalooza,

19:06.813 --> 19:10.025
the woman that you had
your arm around is my mom.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.904
- What?
- Yeah, and I briefly spiraled,

19:13.904 --> 19:16.532
thinking that you were my dad
I've never met.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.701
Because I was actually conceived
at that concert.

19:20.118 --> 19:23.080
- What?
- Yeah. Don't worry! You're not.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.208
Yeah, I know.
I was on a celibacy kick back then.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.960
The '90s were a weird time.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.257
That's your mom?
- Yeah.

19:34.258 --> 19:36.552
Okay, we didn't sleep together,

19:36.552 --> 19:37.594
but we kissed.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.930
- You did?
- And did other stuff.

19:39.930 --> 19:40.806
You did?

19:42.015 --> 19:45.269
- A lot of other stuff.
- Oh! Why didn't she tell me that?

19:45.853 --> 19:47.479
Ugh, didn't see this text.

19:47.479 --> 19:50.774
"He was on some lame celibacy thing,

19:50.774 --> 19:54.403
so we just explored each other's bodies
with our hands and our mouth..."

19:55.237 --> 19:57.739
Yeah. I told you it was a weird time.

19:58.407 --> 20:01.159
But, Sophie, it was years ago.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.161
Decades.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.622
Three decades.
We could come back from this.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.125
We can totally come back from this.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.385
We can't come back from this!
- We can't come back from this.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.433
Goodbye, Robert.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.812
Goodbye, Sophie.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.023
Say hi to your mom for me.

20:32.858 --> 20:35.569
Ai!

20:37.779 --> 20:39.740
- Hi.
- Hi!

20:40.741 --> 20:41.992
I broke up with Robert.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.577
Wait, what happened?

20:45.037 --> 20:47.039
I don't even know where to begin.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.584
Maybe I'll start with...

20:52.085 --> 20:53.921
I think I wanna find my dad.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.172
What?
Wow.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.051
Then, we will help you find him.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.386
Thanks.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.181
<i>♪ The way you said,
darling, I love you ♪</i>

21:04.181 --> 21:06.225
Did I miss Lost and Found Day?

21:06.225 --> 21:08.852
Don't worry. That box will be
full again before you know it.

21:08.852 --> 21:09.895
Good!

21:12.314 --> 21:13.607
Look at us.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.568
A newly single woman,

21:16.568 --> 21:18.529
her engaged best friend...

21:18.529 --> 21:20.447
I am not really engaged.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.741
Yo, this centerpiece is fire.

21:23.408 --> 21:26.411
She was 100% engaged!

21:26.912 --> 21:29.748
Can we please get some food?
I'm starving.

21:29.748 --> 21:32.376
Yes.
- Robert was supposed to make us dinner,

21:32.376 --> 21:34.002
and then I realized

21:34.002 --> 21:36.046
he was maybe my dad.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.841
