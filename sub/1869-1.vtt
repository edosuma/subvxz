01:25.836 --> 01:27.920
Ronson's down.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.589
He needs medical evac.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.424
<i>Where is it? Is it there?</i>

01:31.508 --> 01:32.508
Hard drive's gone.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.510
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:38.056 --> 01:39.474
It's gone. Give me a minute.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.517
<i>They must have it.
Get after them.</i>

01:46.398 --> 01:47.523
I'm stabilizing Ronson.

01:47.691 --> 01:48.858
<i>We don't have the time.</i>

01:48.984 --> 01:50.526
I have to stop the bleeding!

01:51.028 --> 01:52.612
<i>Leave him!</i>

02:27.189 --> 02:28.648
Have you got him?

02:29.107 --> 02:30.608
He's in the black Audi.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.527
What about Ronson?

02:32.653 --> 02:33.694
He's been hit.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.905
We're sending an emergency
evacuation squad.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.615
They'll be too bloody late!

02:39.076 --> 02:40.284
He's seen us.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.829
Medical evac for Ronson
five minutes away.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.170
That's all right.
You weren't using it.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.591
I wasn't using
that one, either.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.305
Keep your head down.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.466
Just get clear!

04:20.427 --> 04:22.053
Tanner, which way?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.846
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.514
You both know
what's at stake here.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.183
We can't afford
to lose that list.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.309
Yes, ma'am.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.465
<i>Where are they now?</i>

04:59.549 --> 05:02.009
They appear to be on the
rooftops of the Grand Bazaar.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.272
Take a left. There's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.554
Down, sir!

06:48.533 --> 06:50.409
What happened?
They're on the train, ma'am.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.702
What do you mean on the train?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.149
I mean,
they're on top of a train.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.645
Well, get after them,
for God's sake!

07:25.195 --> 07:26.529
She's going out of range.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.988
We've lost tracking.
We're blind here.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.990
What's going on?
I'm still with them.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.201
Get me CCTV,
satellite, anything!

08:22.169 --> 08:23.502
<i>What was that?</i>

08:24.087 --> 08:25.087
VW Beetles.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.755
I think.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.366
Bond!
He's uncoupling the cars.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.156
<i>007, are you all right?</i>

09:34.658 --> 09:36.325
Just changing carriages.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.912
<i>What's going on? Report!</i>

09:40.038 --> 09:41.747
It's rather hard
to explain, ma'am.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.540
<i>007's still in pursuit.</i>

10:48.231 --> 10:50.149
Looks like there
isn't much more road.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.234
I don't think I
can go any further.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.270
I may have a shot.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.612
It's not clean.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.364
<i>Repeat, I do not
have a clean shot.</i>

11:45.789 --> 11:47.831
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.625
Can you get into
a better position?

11:49.793 --> 11:51.335
Negative. There's no time.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.463
Take the shot.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.758
<i>I said take the shot.</i>

11:59.386 --> 12:00.803
I can't! I may hit Bond.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.137
Take the bloody shot!

12:25.370 --> 12:26.870
<i>Agent down.</i>

17:45.857 --> 17:48.233
It's like being summoned
to the headmaster's study.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.736
It's a new Chairman.
Just standard procedure.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.988
Bloody waste of my
time is what I call it.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.157
I'm sorry to have
to deal with such

17:55.283 --> 17:57.242
a delicate subject at
our first encounter.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.329
But, um...

18:01.873 --> 18:03.665
I have to be frank with you.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.834
I think that
would be a good idea.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.881
The Prime Minister's concerned.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.509
Well, you can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.678
Have you considered
pulling out the agents?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.180
I've considered every option.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.599
Forgive me,
that sounds like an evasion.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.684
Forgive me, but why am I here?

18:23.895 --> 18:27.773
Three months ago, you lost the
computer drive containing the identity

18:27.899 --> 18:30.358
of almost every
NATO agent embedded in

18:30.485 --> 18:32.903
terrorist organizations
across the globe.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.406
A list which, in the eyes of
our allies, never existed.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.410
So if you'll forgive me, I think
you know why you're here.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.370
Are we to call this
"civilian oversight"?

18:42.580 --> 18:46.041
No, we're to call
this "retirement planning."

18:47.752 --> 18:49.753
Your country has only the
highest respect for you

18:49.879 --> 18:51.880
and your many years of service.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.799
When your current
posting is completed,

18:53.883 --> 18:57.052
you'll be awarded
GCMG with full honors.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.222
Congratulations.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.098
You're firing me.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.643
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period

19:04.769 --> 19:07.479
leading to your voluntary
retirement in two months' time.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.497
Your successor has yet to be
appointed, so we'll be asking you...

19:10.566 --> 19:12.275
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.070
I know I can't do
this job forever

19:15.404 --> 19:17.364
but I'll be damned if I'm
going to leave the department

19:17.490 --> 19:19.491
in worse shape than I found it.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.160
M, you've had a great run.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.287
You should leave with dignity.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.582
Oh, to hell with dignity. I'll
leave when the job's done.

19:46.644 --> 19:47.811
Yes?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.480
Now?

19:52.441 --> 19:56.444
Ma'am, alert from Q-Branch. Someone's
trying to decrypt the stolen hard drive.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.947
We're tracing
the encryption signal.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.615
Localizing now.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.120
Centering in the UK.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.540
London.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.625
Get us back to base
as soon as possible.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.134
It's coming from Ml6.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.468
What?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.762
The data packet is
linking to our network.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.473
Correction.
This is behind our firewall.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.100
We should shut down.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.184
No, track it.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.395
We have to know
where it's coming from.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.314
Strip the headers.
Trace the source.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.357
How the hell did they
get into our system?

20:34.984 --> 20:36.318
Getting trace back now.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.490
It appears...

20:43.993 --> 20:45.577
It appears to be
your computer, ma'am.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.329
Shut it down.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.502
What is this?

21:15.733 --> 21:17.859
For God's sake!

21:19.904 --> 21:21.404
Just get out of the way!

21:22.281 --> 21:24.032
Don't you recognize the car?
Madam.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.636
Oh...!

23:54.600 --> 23:57.352
<i>This is CNN Breaking News.</i>

23:57.686 --> 24:00.021
<i>Emergency crews are still
attempting to assess</i>

24:00.189 --> 24:02.524
<i>the damage as
investigators hunt for leads</i>

24:02.691 --> 24:04.734
<i>in what now
appears to be a major</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:06.945
<i>terrorist attack in
the heart of London.</i>

24:08.572 --> 24:11.783
<i>No-one has yet claimed responsibility
for what sources are calling</i>

24:11.951 --> 24:16.204
<i>a possible "cyber-terrorist assault"
on the British Secret Service.</i>

24:16.372 --> 24:18.581
<i>Early reports from
the scene indicate</i>

24:18.707 --> 24:20.917
<i>at least six dead,
many more injured,</i>

24:21.127 --> 24:24.045
<i>with victims being evacuated
to local hospitals</i>

24:24.130 --> 24:25.964
<i>within minutes
of the explosion.</i>

24:44.400 --> 24:46.151
It's time to go, ma'am.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.406
I'm going to find
whoever did this.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.373
Where the hell have you been?

25:43.167 --> 25:45.126
Enjoying death.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.047
007 reporting for duty.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.014
Why didn't you call?

25:58.474 --> 26:00.475
You didn't get the postcard?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.727
You should try it some time.
Get away from it all.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.687
It really lends perspective.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.148
Ran out of drink
where you were, did they?

26:07.358 --> 26:08.983
What was it you said?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.486
"Take the bloody shot."

26:11.654 --> 26:13.029
I made a judgment call.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.657
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.659
It was the possibility
of losing you

26:17.826 --> 26:20.328
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.331
I made the only decision
I could and you know it.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.667
I think you lost your nerve.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.253
What do you expect,
a bloody apology?

26:28.671 --> 26:30.046
You know the rules of the game.

26:30.172 --> 26:31.589
You've been
playing it long enough.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.715
We both have.

26:33.676 --> 26:34.926
Maybe too long.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.262
Speak for yourself.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.849
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

26:42.935 --> 26:44.018
No.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.856
So this is it.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.276
We're both played out.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.404
Well, if you believe that,
why did you come back?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.197
Good question.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.784
Because we're under attack.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.788
And you know we need you.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.294
Well, I'm here.

27:11.046 --> 27:14.632
You'll have to be debriefed and
declared fit for active service.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.552
You can only return to duty
when you've passed the tests,

27:17.720 --> 27:20.054
so take them seriously.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.640
And a shower might be in order.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.892
I'll go home and change.

27:25.477 --> 27:29.063
Oh, we've sold your flat,
put your things into storage.

27:30.107 --> 27:33.234
Standard procedure on the death
of an unmarried employee

27:33.319 --> 27:35.611
with no next of kin.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.405
You should have called.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.282
I'll find a hotel.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.909
Well, you're bloody
well not sleeping here.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.454
The assailant hacked into
the environmental control system,

28:12.524 --> 28:14.108
locked out the safety protocols

28:14.276 --> 28:17.612
and turned on the gas, all of which
should have been impossible.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.114
On top of that,
they hacked into her files.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.534
They knew her appointments, knew
she'd be out of the building.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.453
They weren't targeting her.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.039
They wanted her to see it.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.750
Where are we, Tanner?

28:30.876 --> 28:32.168
New digs.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.221
The old building was declared
"strategically vulnerable".

28:43.555 --> 28:45.473
That's putting it mildly.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.976
He was able to breach the most
secure computer system in Britain.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.853
So we're on war footing now.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.856
This was part of
Churchill's bunker.

28:54.316 --> 28:55.566
We're still discovering tunnels

28:55.692 --> 28:56.984
dating back to
the 18th Century.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.487
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.155
When do I see M?

29:01.240 --> 29:04.700
Tomorrow you'll see M and
Mallory, too, if you're lucky.

29:04.827 --> 29:05.993
Who's Mallory?

29:06.161 --> 29:08.830
The new Chairman of the Intelligence
and Security Committee.

29:08.914 --> 29:09.997
Charming man.
I think you and he

29:10.082 --> 29:11.499
are really going to hit it off.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.753
Welcome to the new Ml6.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.897
We've attempted to trace
the computer message, but

29:35.065 --> 29:38.025
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm,

29:38.193 --> 29:39.694
which bounced the signal
all over the globe

29:39.778 --> 29:41.779
through over
a thousand different servers.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.573
And now that they've
accessed M's codes,

29:43.699 --> 29:46.367
it's only a matter of time before
they're able to decrypt the list.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.953
Q-Branch have been analyzing the
picture but so far nothing.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.373
The general feeling is it's
probably someone from her past.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.042
Perhaps when she was running
things in Hong Kong.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.544
She's no idea
what it all means.

29:56.670 --> 29:57.795
You believe that?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.003
The truth is, we don't have
a clue who took the list

30:01.258 --> 30:03.384
or what they
plan to do with it.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.517
We can always do this later.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.438
You know what? Let's.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.466
I'd like to start with some
simple word associations.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.969
Just tell me the first word
that pops into your head.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.513
For example, I might say "Day"
and you might say...

31:30.639 --> 31:31.639
Wasted.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.228
All right.

31:41.608 --> 31:42.942
Gun.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.028
Shot.
Agent.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.530
Provocateur.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.614
Woman.

31:48.740 --> 31:49.657
Provocatrix.

31:49.908 --> 31:50.866
Heart.

31:50.993 --> 31:51.993
Target.

31:52.995 --> 31:54.203
Bird.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.538
Sky.

31:55.706 --> 31:56.747
M.

31:56.873 --> 31:57.915
Bitch.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.419
Sunlight.

32:01.545 --> 32:02.670
Swim.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.505
Moonlight.
Dance.

32:04.673 --> 32:05.840
Murder.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.258
Employment.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.552
Country.
England.

32:09.678 --> 32:10.222
Skyfall.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.607
Done.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.865
Well, this is going well.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.498
Get these analyzed.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.084
For her eyes only.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.114
She's ready for you.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.700
I'm sorry, have we met before?

33:56.493 --> 33:58.619
I'm the one who
should say "sorry".

34:00.872 --> 34:02.707
It was only four ribs.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.209
Some of the less vital organs.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.420
Nothing major.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.386
Not enough
excitement in Istanbul?

34:15.554 --> 34:17.138
I've been reassigned.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.306
Temporary suspension
from field work.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.891
Really?
Mmm.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.643
Something to do
with killing 007.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.770
Well, you gave it
your best shot.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.647
That was hardly my best shot.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.065
I'm not sure I
could survive your best.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.985
I doubt you'll get the chance.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.405
Well, do me a favor, will you? If
they do ever let you back out there,

34:35.991 --> 34:37.158
warn me first.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.494
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition,

34:40.661 --> 34:42.496
and then I'll be
back in the field.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.331
That's what you want?

34:44.498 --> 34:45.916
Yes, of course.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.668
It's not for everyone.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.087
Ah, 007. It's this way.

34:50.755 --> 34:55.592
In your defense, a moving
target is much harder to hit.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.263
Then you better keep moving.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.692
The whole office
goes up in smoke

35:11.818 --> 35:13.569
and that bloody thing survives.

35:14.070 --> 35:17.573
Your interior decorating tips have
always been appreciated, 007.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.910
007, Gareth Mallory.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.453
I hope I haven't
missed anything.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.038
The PM does
prattle on in a crisis.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.289
Bond.

35:25.707 --> 35:26.791
Mallory.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.423
I've just been
reviewing Bond's tests.

35:34.716 --> 35:38.052
It seems you've passed...
by the skin of your teeth.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.262
You're back on active service.

35:41.223 --> 35:42.348
Congratulations.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.599
Thank you.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.434
I'll, um...

35:45.519 --> 35:46.644
I'll be outside.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.979
I only have one question.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.565
Why not stay dead?

35:52.901 --> 35:56.278
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.657
Not many field agents get
to leave this cleanly.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.450
Do you get out
in the field much?

36:02.953 --> 36:06.163
You don't need to be an
operative to see the obvious.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.791
It's a young man's game.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.585
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.004
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.091
The only shame would be not
admitting it until it's too late.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.178
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.265
If he says he's ready,
he's ready.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.852
Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.645
What exactly are you implying?

36:30.272 --> 36:31.647
You're sentimental about him.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.819
As long as I'm head of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.865
Fair enough.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.037
Good luck, 007.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.874
Don't cock it up.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.716
We've analyzed
the shrapnel fragments.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.162
You're lucky it
wasn't a direct hit

37:01.219 --> 37:02.553
or it would have
cut you in half.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.973
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.018
Hard to get,
extremely expensive,

37:09.144 --> 37:11.812
and only used by a select few.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.148
Recognize anyone?

37:15.817 --> 37:17.067
Him.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.487
Okay. Name's Patrice.

37:20.614 --> 37:23.032
He's a ghost. No known residence
or country of origin.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.742
So how do we find him?

37:24.868 --> 37:28.078
Well, luckily, we still have one
or two friends left in the CIA.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.997
They're after him for the
Yemeni ambassador's murder,

37:30.123 --> 37:31.874
and they're getting close.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.001
Intel is he's
going to be in Shanghai

37:34.127 --> 37:35.920
in two days time,
probably on a job.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.672
You're to go there and await
further instructions.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.758
If he turns up, he's yours.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.219
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.388
Then terminate him, for Ronson.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.015
With pleasure.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.864
Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

37:52.479 --> 37:53.479
No.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.358
Report to the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.902
He hasn't set up
shop yet, but Tanner will

38:00.028 --> 38:02.029
put you two together.
Good luck.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.281
Thank you.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.827
007.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.040
You are ready for this?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.459
Yes, ma'am.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.548
I didn't know Bond
passed the tests.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.384
He didn't.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.374
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.

38:55.709 --> 38:59.294
A grand old warship being
ignominiously hauled away for scrap.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.883
The inevitability of time,
don't you think?

39:07.637 --> 39:08.887
What do you see?

39:10.932 --> 39:12.516
A bloody big ship.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.852
Excuse me.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.603
007...

39:18.189 --> 39:20.190
I'm your new Quartermaster.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.610
You must be joking.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.821
Why, because I'm not
wearing a lab coat?

39:25.905 --> 39:27.948
Because you still have spots.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.784
My complexion is
hardly relevant.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.870
Well, your competence is.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.664
Age is no
guarantee of efficiency.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.542
And youth is no
guarantee of innovation.

39:39.169 --> 39:40.669
I'll hazard I
can do more damage

39:40.795 --> 39:42.337
on my laptop
sitting in my pajamas

39:42.464 --> 39:44.048
before my first
cup of Earl Grey

39:44.132 --> 39:45.841
than you can do in
a year in the field.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.551
Oh, so why do you need me?

39:49.262 --> 39:51.221
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.807
Or not pulled.

39:54.476 --> 39:57.061
It's hard to know
which in your pajamas.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.649
Q.

40:02.776 --> 40:04.526
007.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.282
Ticket to Shanghai.

40:10.450 --> 40:11.617
Documentation and passport.

40:11.743 --> 40:12.951
Thank you.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.203
And this.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.584
Walther PPK/S 9mm short.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.588
There's a micro-dermal
sensor in the grip.

40:25.131 --> 40:28.258
It's been coded to your palm
print so only you can fire it.

40:28.760 --> 40:32.513
Less of a random killing machine,
more of a personal statement.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.014
And this?

40:35.642 --> 40:37.726
Standard issue
radio transmitter.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.730
Activate it and it
broadcasts your location.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.649
Distress signal.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.443
And that's it.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.280
A gun...

40:51.116 --> 40:52.449
...and a radio.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.787
Not exactly Christmas, is it?

40:57.455 --> 41:00.040
Were you expecting
an exploding pen?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.710
We don't really go
in for that anymore.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.220
Good luck out
there in the field.

41:13.888 --> 41:16.807
And please return the
equipment in one piece.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.730
Brave new world.

49:43.481 --> 49:44.939
Who's got the list?

49:49.737 --> 49:52.197
Tell me!
Who are you working for?

51:21.328 --> 51:24.330
Tanner... He's posted
the first five names.

51:24.749 --> 51:27.500
Their cover's blown. They're in danger.
Get them out now.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.250
Room service.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.720
I didn't order anything.
Not even you.

52:21.222 --> 52:22.722
I've got some new information.

52:23.933 --> 52:27.477
Aren't you a little overqualified
to be delivering messages?

52:27.853 --> 52:30.230
It's all part of
the learning curve.

52:30.815 --> 52:32.649
And Q's afraid of flying.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.859
Of course he is.

52:35.236 --> 52:38.738
So whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

52:39.615 --> 52:41.908
They posted the first
five names on the web.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.285
Well, it was only
a matter of time.

52:44.411 --> 52:45.870
Well, that's just the start.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.915
They're posting five more next
week, and the week after.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.709
It's some kind
of sadistic game.

52:56.924 --> 52:58.758
Cut-throat razor.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.095
How very traditional.

53:03.305 --> 53:06.099
Well, I like to do some things
the old-fashioned way.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.396
Sometimes the old
ways are the best.

53:22.032 --> 53:24.617
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

53:27.079 --> 53:28.288
M's...

53:29.164 --> 53:31.624
...already
briefed me on the list.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.961
Raising
the tantalizing question

53:35.129 --> 53:37.130
of what you're
really doing here.

53:38.340 --> 53:40.884
My official
directive was to help...

53:42.553 --> 53:44.637
"in any way I can."

53:46.140 --> 53:48.808
Like spying for Mallory.

53:50.769 --> 53:53.479
You know, Mallory's not as bad
as you think.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.482
He's a bureaucrat.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.277
You should do your homework.

53:59.987 --> 54:02.447
Gareth Mallory was
a Lieutenant Colonel...

54:02.573 --> 54:05.283
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland, Hereford Regiment.

54:05.409 --> 54:07.869
Spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

54:09.538 --> 54:12.332
So there's more to
him than meets the eye.

54:15.002 --> 54:16.336
We'll see.

54:18.380 --> 54:19.672
Keep still.

54:22.217 --> 54:24.177
This is the tricky part.

54:35.773 --> 54:37.690
Now that's better.

54:38.943 --> 54:40.068
You look the part now.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.195
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

54:43.656 --> 54:45.490
And what part's that?

54:47.493 --> 54:49.035
Old dog,

54:50.204 --> 54:52.038
new tricks.

56:03.986 --> 56:05.445
Good evening.

56:05.571 --> 56:06.988
<i>Evening.</i>

56:07.156 --> 56:08.948
Don't touch your ear.

56:10.284 --> 56:12.285
I've got three exits,

56:13.162 --> 56:15.121
lots of blind spots.

56:15.664 --> 56:17.290
I've got them covered.

56:23.589 --> 56:25.631
You look
beautiful in that dress.

56:25.758 --> 56:27.425
<i>You don't scrub
up so bad yourself.</i>

56:27.509 --> 56:30.470
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.

56:30.971 --> 56:32.638
<i>You're telling me.</i>

56:34.308 --> 56:36.017
Do you gamble?

56:36.143 --> 56:37.852
<i>I like a little
flutter now and then.</i>

56:40.314 --> 56:42.982
Who doesn't like
to take chances?

56:48.322 --> 56:50.323
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

56:50.449 --> 56:52.492
I'd like to cash
this in, please.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.500
One moment, sir.

57:32.991 --> 57:34.534
Good fortune tonight, sir.

57:40.707 --> 57:42.208
Let's hope so.

57:51.218 --> 57:52.885
With compliments of the house.

57:53.011 --> 57:54.720
Thank you.

58:15.742 --> 58:18.411
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink.

58:20.581 --> 58:22.915
Maybe I'll even stretch to two.

58:24.126 --> 58:26.586
I'm guessing I've got four
million euros in here.

58:27.045 --> 58:29.547
Not bad. I like this game.

58:30.215 --> 58:31.799
Why don't we play another?

58:33.135 --> 58:34.927
I don't gamble.

58:38.056 --> 58:39.932
I'm not very lucky.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.268
A little like our
friend in Shanghai.

58:46.273 --> 58:49.609
I've been waiting to see
who would redeem the chip.

58:49.985 --> 58:53.487
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.907
Did I over-complicate
the plot?

58:57.242 --> 59:00.119
Who doesn't appreciate
the occasional twist, Mr...?

59:00.787 --> 59:02.038
Bond.

59:02.122 --> 59:03.414
James Bond.

59:04.499 --> 59:05.958
Severine.

59:06.168 --> 59:10.796
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your
next performance over that drink?

59:11.506 --> 59:12.965
I'd like that.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.137
Will your
friends be joining us?

59:20.140 --> 59:22.975
That, I'm afraid,
is inevitable.

59:26.355 --> 59:27.521
<i>She's pretty.</i>

59:27.648 --> 59:28.856
Now, now.

59:29.024 --> 59:31.150
<i>If you like that sort of thing.</i>

59:31.818 --> 59:33.527
I'll keep you posted.

59:45.332 --> 59:46.499
Perfect.

59:49.002 --> 59:52.046
Would you mind if I asked
you a business question?

59:53.048 --> 59:54.674
Depends on the question.

59:55.509 --> 59:57.885
It has to do with death.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:02.223
A subject in which
you're well-versed.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.183
And how would you know that?

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.396
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.732
with a Beretta 70
strapped to her thigh.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:14.944
One can never be
too careful when

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.863
handsome men in
tuxedos carry Walthers.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:23.244
I am correct in
assuming you killed Patrice?

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.705
Yes.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.250
Might I ask why?

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.253
I want to meet your employer.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.059
Be careful what you wish for.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:50.187
You're scared.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.940
Thank you for the drink,

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.569
Mr. Bond.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.412
You put on a good show.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.541
But ever since we sat down,
you haven't stopped

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.626
looking at your bodyguards.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.630
Now, three of them
is a bit excessive.

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:20.551
They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:25.973
The tattoo on your wrist
is Macau sex trade.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:30.603
You belonged to one of the houses.
What were you? 12? 13?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.315
I'm guessing he
was your way out.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.777
Perhaps you
thought you were in love.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:41.655
But that was a long time ago.

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:46.118
You know nothing about it.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.789
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.169
How much do you
know about fear?

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:57.505
All there is.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.633
Not like this.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:04.804
Not like him.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:07.681
I can help you.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:09.809
I don't think so.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:10.976
Let me try.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:14.814
How?

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:17.650
Bring me to him.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:21.487
Can you kill him?

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:22.655
Yes.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:25.324
Will you?

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:27.827
Someone usually dies.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:34.375
Perhaps you can.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.802
When I leave,
they're going to kill you.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:49.807
If you survive, I'm on the Chimera.
North harbor.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.393
Berth seven.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.896
We cast off in an hour.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.404
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:06.574
Good luck.

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.036
Good luck with that.

01:04:58.687 --> 01:04:59.812
Thank you.

01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:06.110
Put it all on red.

01:05:08.989 --> 01:05:10.656
It's the circle of life.

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:35.973
Yes!

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:41.729
It's time to cast off.

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:44.857
All right.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:43.248
I like you better
without your Beretta.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.587
I feel naked without it.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:06.980
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:10.567
<i>The controversy surrounding the
Ministry of Defence has escalated today</i>

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:14.321
<i>as images of the Husein assassination
continue to circulate.</i>

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.407
<i>We should warn you,
some viewers</i>

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.283
<i>might find these
images disturbing.</i>

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.955
<i>Captain Husein, an Ml6 operative
embedded in the Middle East,</i>

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.040
<i>was one of
the five agents exposed</i>

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.959
<i>in what is now being considered</i>

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:30.629
<i>the greatest internal security
breach in modern British history.</i>

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:34.800
<i>The Prime Minister continues to
express public support for Ml6</i>

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:37.010
<i>while the opposition has taken
the position...</i>

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:39.865
Has taken the position we're a
bunch of antiquated bloody idiots

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.975
fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:45.227
Look, three of my agents
are dead already.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.187
Don't embroil me
in politics now.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:50.649
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:54.069
Oh, standing in the stocks at midday?
Who's antiquated now?

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:56.480
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself.
We're a democracy,

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:59.116
accountable to the people
we're trying to defend.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.327
We can't keep working in the shadows.
There are no more shadows.

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.246
You don't get this, do you?

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:08.709
Whoever's behind this, whoever's
doing it, he knows us.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:12.087
He's one of us. He comes
from the same place as Bond.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.214
The place you
say doesn't exist.

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.009
The shadows.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:57.174
It's not too late.
We could turn back now.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.682
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.805
They abandoned it
almost overnight.

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:50.227
He made them think there was a
leak at the chemical plant.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:54.940
It's amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.945
He wanted the island,
so he took it.

01:10:01.573 --> 01:10:04.116
Does he always
get what he wants?

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.577
More than you know.

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:10.956
I'm sorry.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.778
Hello, James. Welcome.

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.656
Do you like the island?

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:49.536
My grandmother had an island.

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:53.206
Nothing to boast of. You could
walk around it in an hour.

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:56.376
But still, it was,
it was a paradise for us.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:10:59.504
One summer, we went for a visit

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:03.634
and discovered the place had
been infested with rats!

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:08.221
They'd come on a fishing boat and
gorged themselves on coconut.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:11.058
So how do you get
rats off an island? Hmm?

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.727
My grandmother showed me.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:17.356
We buried an oil
drum and hinged the lid,

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.733
then wired coconut
to the lid as bait.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:21.864
And the rats would
come for the coconut and...

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.530
...they would
fall into the drum.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.743
And after a month, you
have trapped all the rats.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.412
But what do you do then?

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:35.374
Throw the drum into the ocean?

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.377
Burn it? No.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.754
You just leave it.

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:44.091
And they begin to get hungry.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.718
And one by one...

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:50.722
...they start eating each other

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:54.226
until there are only two left.
The two survivors.

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:57.020
And then what?
Do you kill them? No.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.941
You take them and release them
into the trees.

01:12:01.401 --> 01:12:04.111
But now they don't
eat coconut anymore.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:06.780
Now they only eat rat.

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:10.784
You have changed their nature.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:14.162
The two survivors,

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:16.665
this is what she made us.

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:21.461
I made my own choices.

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.839
You think you did.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:26.425
That's her genius.

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:32.347
Station H.
Am I right? Hong Kong.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.640
Mm-hmm.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.268
'86 to '97.

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:39.229
Back then, I was her favorite.

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:42.899
And you're not nearly the agent
I was, I can tell you that.

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:49.072
Just look at you, barely held together
by your pills and your drink.

01:12:49.157 --> 01:12:50.949
Don't forget my
pathetic love of country.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:56.621
You're still clinging to your
faith in that old woman.

01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:59.458
When all she does is lie to you.
She never lied to me.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.168
No?
No.

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:03.712
What did you score in your
marksmanship evaluation?

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:05.088
70.

01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:07.799
40.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:12.262
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.681
Yes.
No. No.

01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:27.611
Medical evaluation: Fail.
Physical evaluation: Failed.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:30.113
Psychological evaluation:
"Alcohol

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.449
and substance
addiction indicated."

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.621
"Pathological
rejection of authority

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:40.165
based on
unresolved childhood trauma."

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.507
"Subject is not
approved for field duty

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:51.676
and immediate suspension
from service advised."

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.054
What is this if not betrayal?

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.183
She sent you after me knowing you're
not ready, knowing you'll likely die.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.852
Mommy was very bad!

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:05.398
Hmm?

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:23.416
Ooh.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.711
See what she's done to you?

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:30.715
Well, she never
tied me to a chair.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.509
Her loss.

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:38.557
Are you sure this is about M?

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:40.016
It's about her.

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:43.228
And you, and me.

01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:47.232
You see,
we are the last two rats.

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:49.693
We can either eat each other...

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:53.864
Hmm?

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.285
...or eat everyone else.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.583
How you're trying to remember
your training now.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.545
What's the regulation
to cover this?

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:15.427
Well, first time
for everything. Yes?

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:21.433
What makes you think
this is my first time?

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:24.728
Oh, Mr. Bond!

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:31.109
All that physical stuff...
So dull, so dull.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.197
Chasing spies...

01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:37.365
so old-fashioned!

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.621
Your knees must be killing you.

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:48.752
England.

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:51.630
The Empire! Ml6!

01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:54.090
You're living in
a ruin as well,

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.967
you just don't know it yet.

01:15:57.345 --> 01:16:01.806
At least here there are no old ladies
giving orders and no little...

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:03.892
Bip!

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:06.478
Gadgets from
those fools in Q-Branch.

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:14.027
If you wanted, you could pick your
own secret missions. As I do.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.824
Name it.

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:25.580
Destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks...

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:26.748
Bip. Easy.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:31.169
Interrupt transmissions from a
spy satellite over Kabul...

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:32.462
Done.

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:37.133
Hmm. Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:39.844
Or a gas explosion in London.

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.514
Just point and click.

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:44.641
Well, everybody needs a hobby.

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:52.315
So what's yours?

01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:56.528
Resurrection.

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:02.158
Let me show you something.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.715
Tells a story, doesn't it?

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.679
They left
the island so quickly,

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.556
they couldn't
decide what to take,

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.766
what to leave,
what was important.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:31.021
And seeing this every day reminds
me to focus on the essentials.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.899
There's nothing... nothing
superfluous in my life.

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:38.737
When a thing is redundant,
it is eliminated.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.082
50-year-old Macallan.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.544
A particular favorite
of yours, I understand.

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:59.090
So, what's the toast?

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.720
"To the women we love"?

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:05.263
Hmm.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:15.940
Darling.

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:19.611
Darling, your lovers are here.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.618
No, no, no, no.

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.162
Stand up straight.
Keep still.

01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.957
And whatever you do,
don't lose your head.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.501
Don't lose...

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.169
your head.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.799
Don't lose your head.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:44.594
Time to redeem
your marksmanship scores.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.472
Let's see.

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:52.477
Who can be the first to knock
the glass from her head?

01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:01.319
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.840
Let's see who ends up on top.

01:19:34.854 --> 01:19:36.688
Oh, I can't believe it.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:40.483
I can't believe it!
Did you really die that day?

01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:45.321
Is there any, any of
the old 007 left?

01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:55.206
My turn.

01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:01.713
I win.
What do you say to that?

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.509
It's a waste of good Scotch.

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:21.441
What are you going to do now? Take
me back to her? All on your own?

01:20:22.109 --> 01:20:23.902
Who says I'm on my own?

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.256
It's the latest
thing from Q-Branch.

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:47.759
It's called a radio.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.949
All right, time to say hello.

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.984
You're smaller than I remember!

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:48.987
Whereas I barely
remember you at all.

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:52.490
Strange. For me,
it feels just like yesterday.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.868
Are you surprised?

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:59.414
Not particularly. But then you
always were a slippery one.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.874
Maybe that's why
you liked me so much.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.710
You flatter yourself.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.336
No remorse.

01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:09.882
Just as I had imagined.

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:12.176
Regret is unprofessional.

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.518
"Regret is unprofessional."

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:25.690
They kept me for five months in a
room with no air. They tortured me.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.860
And I protected your secrets.
I protected you.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:33.281
But they made me suffer.
And suffer.

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:36.868
And suffer.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.871
Until I realized...

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:43.374
...it was you who betrayed me.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.377
You betrayed me.

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:50.798
So, I had only one thing left.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.220
My cyanide capsule
in my back left molar.

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.890
You remember, right?

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:05.063
So I broke the tooth and...

01:23:05.606 --> 01:23:07.565
...bit into the capsule.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:09.567
And it...

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.740
It burned all my insides.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.950
But I didn't die.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:23.915
Life clung to me
like a disease.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.587
And then...

01:23:29.797 --> 01:23:33.591
I understood why
I had survived.

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:39.764
I needed to look in
your eyes one last time.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:44.769
Well, I hope it was worth it.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.775
Mr. Silva, you're going to be
transferred to Belmarsh Prison

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:53.778
where you'll be
remanded in custody

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.613
until the Crown
Prosecution Service

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.490
deem you fit to
stand trial for...

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.784
Say my name. Say it.

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:01.953
My real name.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.497
I know you remember it.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.959
Your name is on
the memorial wall

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:10.128
of the very
building you attacked.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.630
I will have it struck off.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:17.552
Soon your past will be as
nonexistent as your future.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.471
I'll never see you again.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:25.309
Do you know what
it does to you?

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:29.731
Hydrogen cyanide?

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:44.829
Look upon your work,

01:24:45.873 --> 01:24:47.165
Mother.

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.789
Let me know what you recover
from his computer.

01:25:27.915 --> 01:25:31.375
Has he transmitted the lists? If so, to whom?
I want this resolved.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.543
Yes, ma'am.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.385
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:43.554
He was a brilliant agent.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:47.725
But he started operating beyond
his brief, hacking the Chinese.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:52.480
The handover was coming up and they
were onto him, so I gave him up.

01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:55.733
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:58.986
We should go, ma'am. Board of
Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.489
I want to know
what's on that computer.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:16.796
Now, looking at
Silva's computer,

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:21.217
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:24.303
He's established failsafe
protocols to wipe the memory

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:26.973
if there's any attempt
to access certain files.

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:30.518
Only six people in the world could
program safeguards like that.

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:32.645
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.981
I invented them.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:39.485
Right, then.

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:43.990
Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:47.785
We're in.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:56.752
Sir, what do you make of this?

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:03.593
It's his Omega site.

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:06.304
Most encrypted level he has.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.976
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

01:27:13.312 --> 01:27:15.438
Security through obscurity.

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:19.859
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?

01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:22.653
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.491
We're gathered today
to address important issues

01:27:27.618 --> 01:27:30.161
concerning the future
of our national security.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.835
Going somewhere?

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:43.549
So you believe your stewardship
of Ml6 during the recent crisis

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:45.009
has been up to scratch?

01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:48.471
Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.348
and are taking
all necessary steps

01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:53.184
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:54.560
Oh,

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.312
so it's a job well done.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:58.158
I'm not saying
it's gone perfectly, but...

01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:00.942
You'll forgive me for not
putting up the bunting.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:03.363
I find it rather difficult
to overlook monumental

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:05.363
security breaches
and dead operatives

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:08.282
for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.663
He's using a polymorphic
engine to mutate the code.

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:15.998
Whenever I try to
gain access, it changes.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:19.210
It's like solving a Rubik's
cube that's fighting back.

01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:26.384
Stop.

01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:29.512
Go in on that.

01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:37.228
Granborough.

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:41.691
Granborough Road. It's an old Tube
station on the Metropolitan Line.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.442
Been closed for years.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:47.071
Use that as a key.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.084
Oh, look, it's a map!

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:03.421
It's London.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:06.799
Subterranean London.

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:10.594
What's going on?
Why are the doors open?

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:22.064
Oh, no.

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:24.400
Can someone tell me how the
hell he got into our system?

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:30.031
Oh, shit.

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:33.159
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:36.120
He hacked us.

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:45.171
Oh, no.

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:54.513
Q.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.348
He's gone.

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:07.902
I'm in a stairwell
below isolation.

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.653
<i>Do you read me, Q?</i>

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.322
I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:23.542
Got you.
Tracking your location.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:25.795
<i>Just keep moving forward.</i>

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.380
<i>Enter the next
service door on your right.</i>

01:30:35.222 --> 01:30:37.383
<i>If you're through that door,
you should be in the Tube.</i>

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.475
I'm in the Tube.

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:44.146
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:46.857
<i>He wanted us to capture him, he
wanted us to access his computer.</i>

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:48.567
<i>It was all planned.</i>

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:52.196
Blowing up HQ. Knowing
the emergency protocols.

01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:54.031
Knowing we'd retreat down here.

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:58.536
I've got all that. It's what he's
got planned next that worries me.

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:02.081
District Line is the closest. There's
a service door on your left.

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:04.792
Got it.

01:31:08.547 --> 01:31:09.713
It won't open.

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:11.090
It will.
Put your back into it.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:13.634
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?

01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:19.014
No, it's stuck.

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:22.393
Oh, good.
There's a train coming.

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:29.233
Hmm. That's vexing.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.539
I'm through.

01:31:44.374 --> 01:31:45.875
Told you.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:47.960
We alerted security.
Police are on their way.

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:26.790
Where are you now?

01:32:26.917 --> 01:32:28.167
Temple Tube station.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.960
Along with half of London.

01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:36.091
Oh, I see you. There you are.

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:40.346
I know where I am, Q.
Where's he?

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.431
<i>Give us a second.
I'm looking for him.</i>

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:44.016
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:52.816
<i>There's too many people.
I can't see him.</i>

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:55.069
Welcome to rush
hour on the Tube.

01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:57.321
Not something
you'd know much about.

01:32:57.822 --> 01:32:59.907
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:10.960
The train's leaving.
Do I get on the train?

01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:14.213
Don't get on. I'm not sure he's on it.
Give us a minute.

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:18.050
<i>Do I get on the train?</i>

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:25.015
Bond.

01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:26.976
<i>What?</i>
Get on the train.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:42.741
He's keen to get home.

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:44.994
Will you open the door, please?

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:49.581
Open the door.

01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:54.753
Health and Safety.
Carry on.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:02.594
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:04.763
Take a wild guess, Q.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.558
<i>He's in disguise,
dressed as a policeman.</i>

01:34:07.726 --> 01:34:09.184
Of course he is.

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:33.000
Where's he going?
Where's he going?

01:34:40.425 --> 01:34:43.218
He's going for M. Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.

01:34:43.636 --> 01:34:47.097
You've overlooked, or chosen
to ignore, hard evidence

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:50.851
and consistently,
almost obstinately...

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:53.520
Silva's escaped.
Bond's in pursuit.

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:56.357
We need to get you to a
secure location immediately.

01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:58.359
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna show her my back.

01:34:59.069 --> 01:35:00.611
Are we straining
your attention?

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:04.490
No. Please, Minister, proceed.

01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:13.999
Excuse me.

01:35:32.602 --> 01:35:33.644
Move! Move!

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:39.209
It's as if you
insist on pretending

01:36:39.335 --> 01:36:41.336
we still live in
a golden age of espionage

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:44.298
where human intelligence was
the only resource available.

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:47.134
Well, I find this
rather old-fashioned belief

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:49.553
demonstrates
a reckless disregard for...

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.972
Excuse me, Minister,
I don't mean to interrupt,

01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:54.183
but just for
the sake of variety,

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:56.643
might we actually
hear from the witness?

01:36:58.646 --> 01:36:59.897
Of course.

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:04.359
Thank you.

01:37:29.719 --> 01:37:30.719
Oh!

01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:34.765
I won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.

01:37:35.225 --> 01:37:38.602
Not bad. Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:41.146
Oi. Thank you.

01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:42.606
You caught me.

01:37:44.526 --> 01:37:47.444
Now, here's your prize.

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:51.114
The latest thing
from my local toy store.

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:53.784
It's called radio.

01:37:58.748 --> 01:37:59.748
Whew!

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:04.044
I do hope that wasn't for me.

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:05.796
No.

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:07.756
But that is.

01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:00.517
<i>Chairman, Ministers.</i>

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:03.145
<i>Today I've repeatedly heard how</i>

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:05.522
<i>irrelevant my
department has become.</i>

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:07.733
Why do we need agents?
The Double-O section?

01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:09.860
Isn't it all rather quaint?

01:39:11.696 --> 01:39:14.489
Well, I suppose I see a
different world than you do.

01:39:16.034 --> 01:39:19.202
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:25.000
I'm frightened because our enemies
are no longer known to us.

01:39:25.627 --> 01:39:27.419
They do not exist on a map.

01:39:27.503 --> 01:39:30.005
They're not nations.
They are individuals.

01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:34.843
Look around you.
Who do you fear?

01:39:36.012 --> 01:39:38.722
<i>Can you see a face?
A uniform? A flag? No.</i>

01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:42.225
<i>Our world is not
more transparent now.</i>

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:44.019
It's more opaque.

01:39:44.312 --> 01:39:45.729
It's in the shadows.

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:49.232
That's where we must do battle.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.320
So, before you declare us
irrelevant, ask yourselves,

01:39:54.739 --> 01:39:57.199
how safe do you feel?

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:03.497
I've just one
more thing to say.

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:06.583
My late husband was a
great lover of poetry.

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:08.168
And, um...

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:12.589
I suppose some of it sunk in,
despite my best intentions.

01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:17.761
<i>And here today I remember
this, I think from Tennyson:</i>

01:40:20.223 --> 01:40:23.433
<i>"We are not now that strength,</i>

01:40:23.685 --> 01:40:26.436
<i>which in old days
Moved earth and heaven;"</i>

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:30.107
"That which we are, we are;"

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.944
<i>"One equal temper
of heroic hearts,"</i>

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:37.280
Made weak by time

01:40:37.699 --> 01:40:39.116
and fate,

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:41.952
<i>but strong in will.</i>

01:40:42.453 --> 01:40:44.246
To strive, to seek,

01:40:45.081 --> 01:40:46.581
<i>to find</i>

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.917
and not to yield."

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.292
Go, go, go, go!

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:13.376
Move!

01:42:13.836 --> 01:42:15.378
Move! Go! Move!

01:42:55.837 --> 01:42:58.922
007, what the hell are we doing?
Are you kidnapping me?

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.757
That would be one
way of looking at it.

01:43:03.845 --> 01:43:06.012
Too many people are
dying because of me.

01:43:06.264 --> 01:43:08.431
If he wants you, he'll
have to come and get you.

01:43:08.558 --> 01:43:10.976
We've been one step behind
Silva from the start.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.228
It's time to get out in front,
change the game.

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:15.397
And I'm to be the bait?

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:21.570
All right. But just us.
No one else.

01:43:23.114 --> 01:43:25.448
Q? I need help.

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.617
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?

01:43:27.743 --> 01:43:29.661
I've got M.
We're about to disappear.

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:31.246
What?

01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:33.623
I need you to lay a trail of
breadcrumbs impossible to follow

01:43:33.708 --> 01:43:35.959
for anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it?

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.880
I'm guessing this
isn't strictly official.

01:43:39.964 --> 01:43:41.131
Not even remotely.

01:43:41.424 --> 01:43:44.342
So much for my promising
career in espionage.

01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:55.562
I'm not hiding in there,
if that's your brilliant plan.

01:43:55.646 --> 01:43:57.355
We're changing vehicles.

01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:01.610
Trouble with company cars is
they have trackers.

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:14.247
Oh, and I suppose that's
completely inconspicuous.

01:44:14.999 --> 01:44:16.124
Get in.

01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:40.857
It's not very comfortable,
is it?

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:44.861
Are you gonna
complain the whole way?

01:44:44.987 --> 01:44:47.030
Oh, go on then, eject me.
See if I care.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:51.326
Where are we going?

01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:54.537
Back in time.

01:44:55.623 --> 01:44:57.958
Somewhere we'll
have the advantage.

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:01.169
It's a fine line.

01:45:01.295 --> 01:45:03.797
Make the breadcrumb too small
and he might miss it.

01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:06.132
Too big and Silva
will smell a rat.

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:08.885
But do you think even Silva
will be able to spot that?

01:45:09.637 --> 01:45:11.513
He's the only one who could.

01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:15.016
Sir.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.560
Oh.

01:45:18.062 --> 01:45:19.312
What are you doing?

01:45:19.438 --> 01:45:20.730
We're just... monitoring.

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:23.483
Creating a false tracking
signal for Silva to follow.

01:45:24.402 --> 01:45:26.319
Well, sir, um...
Well, no.

01:45:26.529 --> 01:45:28.405
Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:30.490
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.

01:45:30.574 --> 01:45:32.742
You can monitor his progress
more accurately

01:45:32.868 --> 01:45:34.703
and confirm it with
the traffic cameras.

01:45:34.912 --> 01:45:36.955
But what if the PM finds out?

01:45:38.249 --> 01:45:39.874
Then we're all buggered.

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:41.918
Carry on.

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:26.046
Is this where you grew up?

01:46:26.714 --> 01:46:27.714
Mm.

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:32.177
How old were you
when they died?

01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:37.974
You know the answer to that.

01:46:40.311 --> 01:46:42.437
You know the whole story.

01:46:50.279 --> 01:46:52.906
Orphans always make
the best recruits.

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.663
Storm's coming.

01:48:00.683 --> 01:48:01.850
Christ.

01:48:01.934 --> 01:48:02.934
Mm-hmm.

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:06.521
No wonder you never came back.

01:49:00.284 --> 01:49:01.701
James.

01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:03.703
James Bond.

01:49:03.954 --> 01:49:04.954
Good God.

01:49:06.707 --> 01:49:08.082
Are you still alive?

01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:11.544
It's nice to see you, too.

01:49:13.923 --> 01:49:16.299
M, this is Kincade.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.635
Gamekeeper here
since I was a boy.

01:49:19.136 --> 01:49:20.220
Pleased to meet you, Emma.

01:49:20.346 --> 01:49:21.471
Mr. Kincade.

01:49:23.432 --> 01:49:25.072
You're a tad late.
They've sold the place,

01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:26.559
when they
thought you were dead.

01:49:26.644 --> 01:49:28.311
It seems they were wrong.

01:49:29.605 --> 01:49:30.939
What are you doing here?

01:49:31.315 --> 01:49:32.982
Some men are coming to kill us.

01:49:34.652 --> 01:49:35.892
But we're gonna
kill them first.

01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:39.239
Then we'd better get ready.

01:49:41.617 --> 01:49:43.243
Do we still have a gun room?

01:49:43.994 --> 01:49:44.994
Ah.

01:49:46.956 --> 01:49:51.334
They sold the lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.

01:49:51.794 --> 01:49:53.920
They were
shipped out weeks ago.

01:49:54.463 --> 01:49:55.838
There's just...

01:49:56.507 --> 01:50:00.009
your father's
old hunting rifle.

01:50:01.136 --> 01:50:02.971
We couldn't let that go.

01:50:08.936 --> 01:50:10.353
And this is what we've got.

01:50:12.022 --> 01:50:15.024
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.

01:50:15.359 --> 01:50:17.694
But if all else fails,

01:50:18.112 --> 01:50:22.365
sometimes the old
ways are the best.

01:50:28.372 --> 01:50:30.873
So who is it we're
supposed to be fighting?

01:50:31.208 --> 01:50:33.543
No "we" in it, Kincade.

01:50:34.044 --> 01:50:35.628
This is not your fight.

01:50:35.713 --> 01:50:38.881
Try and stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.

01:50:40.509 --> 01:50:43.928
Now, remember what I taught you.
Don't let it pull to the left.

01:50:45.389 --> 01:50:47.223
I'll do my best.

01:50:55.983 --> 01:50:57.942
What did you say
you did for a living?

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:14.959
Emma!

01:51:15.753 --> 01:51:17.378
I brought you some things.

01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:22.759
The nights get cold here.

01:51:23.218 --> 01:51:25.178
Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

01:51:26.597 --> 01:51:27.678
It's a beautiful old house.

01:51:27.765 --> 01:51:28.806
She is.

01:51:29.767 --> 01:51:34.687
And like all great ladies,
she still has her secret ways.

01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:36.314
Let me show you this.

01:51:41.612 --> 01:51:42.779
Priest's hole?

01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:45.448
Yeah, from Reformation times.

01:51:45.949 --> 01:51:48.117
The tunnel leads
under the moor.

01:51:48.243 --> 01:51:50.411
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:56.376
The night I told him his parents had
died, he hid in here for two days.

01:51:58.796 --> 01:51:59.962
When he did come out...

01:52:00.631 --> 01:52:02.298
he wasn't a boy anymore.

01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:06.094
Eh. Must get on.

01:54:06.507 --> 01:54:08.424
I fucked this up, didn't I?

01:54:10.135 --> 01:54:11.302
No.

01:54:13.222 --> 01:54:14.931
You did your job.

01:54:20.062 --> 01:54:21.729
I read your obituary of me.

01:54:23.482 --> 01:54:24.607
And?

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:25.900
Appalling.

01:54:26.735 --> 01:54:28.236
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.

01:54:30.364 --> 01:54:32.865
I did call you "an exemplar
of British fortitude".

01:54:33.742 --> 01:54:35.409
That bit was all right.

01:54:40.624 --> 01:54:41.749
You ready?

01:54:42.334 --> 01:54:45.419
I was ready before
you were born, son.

01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:06.208
Welcome to Scotland.

01:57:23.078 --> 01:57:24.120
You dropped something.

01:57:50.647 --> 01:57:51.689
You hurt?

01:57:52.566 --> 01:57:54.900
Only my pride.
I never was a good shot.

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:03.868
He's not here.

01:58:38.403 --> 01:58:40.237
Always got to make an entrance.

01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:43.866
You two, go to the kitchen.
Now.

01:59:08.058 --> 01:59:09.058
Get behind the arch!

01:59:52.519 --> 01:59:54.061
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.

02:01:15.977 --> 02:01:20.189
Everyone, listen to me! Don't
you dare touch her. She's mine.

02:01:37.207 --> 02:01:38.727
Can your friend
come out and say hello?

02:02:46.526 --> 02:02:48.610
Come on. This way.

02:03:46.461 --> 02:03:48.504
I always hated this place.

02:03:58.890 --> 02:04:00.349
Are you getting warm?

02:05:29.314 --> 02:05:31.481
Just make sure Bond's dead!

02:05:34.861 --> 02:05:37.070
Now it's me and her.

02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:38.650
You see what comes of all this
running around, Mr. Bond?

02:07:39.819 --> 02:07:42.070
All this jumping and fighting.

02:07:42.238 --> 02:07:44.114
It's exhausting!

02:07:47.285 --> 02:07:48.744
Relax.

02:07:50.413 --> 02:07:52.164
You need to relax.

02:08:10.975 --> 02:08:13.769
Ah, well...
Mother's calling.

02:08:15.396 --> 02:08:17.522
I'll give her
a goodbye kiss for you.

02:08:36.918 --> 02:08:38.960
Oh, my God.

02:10:36.621 --> 02:10:38.497
Of course.

02:10:38.915 --> 02:10:40.540
It had to be here.

02:10:42.919 --> 02:10:44.544
It had to be this way.

02:10:46.005 --> 02:10:47.464
Thank you.

02:10:47.590 --> 02:10:49.299
I can't find it no...
Don't.

02:10:53.262 --> 02:10:55.847
Please. Don't.

02:11:11.155 --> 02:11:13.573
You're hurt. You're hurt.

02:11:17.828 --> 02:11:22.415
What have they done to you?

02:11:54.907 --> 02:11:56.449
Free both of us.

02:11:56.909 --> 02:11:58.618
Free both of us...

02:11:59.954 --> 02:12:01.204
with the same bullet.

02:12:02.957 --> 02:12:05.834
Do it.

02:12:07.962 --> 02:12:09.170
Only you can do it.

02:12:09.964 --> 02:12:11.214
Do it.

02:12:27.023 --> 02:12:28.273
Ah!

02:12:54.216 --> 02:12:56.009
Last rat standing.

02:13:06.270 --> 02:13:09.272
007. What took you so long?

02:13:09.565 --> 02:13:12.525
Well, I got into
some deep water.

02:13:14.445 --> 02:13:15.445
Oh!

02:13:28.542 --> 02:13:30.627
I suppose it's...

02:13:31.045 --> 02:13:33.380
too late to make a run for it?

02:13:39.553 --> 02:13:41.471
Well, I'm game if you are.

02:13:51.899 --> 02:13:54.234
I did get one thing right.

02:15:18.527 --> 02:15:19.778
Wow.

02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:23.198
I didn't even know
you could come up here.

02:15:24.533 --> 02:15:26.367
Hate to waste a view.

02:15:26.744 --> 02:15:28.453
I can see why.

02:15:30.247 --> 02:15:33.124
I thought you were going
back out on active service.

02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:36.419
I declined.

02:15:38.088 --> 02:15:39.464
You said it yourself,

02:15:40.049 --> 02:15:41.800
fieldwork's not for everyone.

02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:45.637
If it helps,
I feel a lot safer.

02:15:50.935 --> 02:15:52.811
Her will was read today.

02:15:53.729 --> 02:15:55.230
She left you this.

02:16:07.493 --> 02:16:10.370
Maybe it was her way of telling
you to take a desk job.

02:16:11.247 --> 02:16:12.997
Just the opposite.

02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:17.502
Thank you.

02:16:36.438 --> 02:16:38.982
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.

02:16:42.653 --> 02:16:44.111
Well, my name's Eve.

02:16:44.905 --> 02:16:46.322
Eve Moneypenny.

02:16:47.282 --> 02:16:49.868
Well, I look forward to our
time together, Miss Moneypenny.

02:16:50.369 --> 02:16:54.539
Me, too. I'm sure we'll have
one or two close shaves.

02:16:56.916 --> 02:16:57.959
Morning, 007.

02:16:58.084 --> 02:16:59.127
Good morning, Tanner.

02:16:59.545 --> 02:17:00.545
He'll see you now.

02:17:15.977 --> 02:17:17.312
How's the arm, sir?

02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:20.440
What? Oh, it's fine.

02:17:20.566 --> 02:17:21.816
It'll get better.

02:17:21.941 --> 02:17:24.818
All pretty shocking for
someone unused to fieldwork.

02:17:27.823 --> 02:17:31.325
So, 007...
Lots to be done.

02:17:35.496 --> 02:17:37.415
Are you ready to
get back to work?

02:17:39.334 --> 02:17:41.419
With pleasure, M.

02:17:43.672 --> 02:17:45.673
With pleasure.
