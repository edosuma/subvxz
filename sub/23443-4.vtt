Lynn!
- What's wrong?!

17:38.190 --> 17:39.525
{\an1}- Look what I found
on the floor:

17:39.591 --> 17:40.893
Lana's lucky chicken bone!

17:40.959 --> 17:41.994
- A, that's gross.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.429
B, it means they're on to us!

17:43.495 --> 17:45.364
{\an3}They've been sneaking in
here behind our backs!

17:45.431 --> 17:48.467
- Fine. Our secret bathroom
may not be a secret anymore,

17:48.534 --> 17:50.002
but it's still ours!

17:50.068 --> 17:51.904
{\an1}We'll just have to lay down
the law with them!

17:51.970 --> 17:53.272
- Absolutely!

17:53.338 --> 17:55.607
Sorry, guys, but you
can't use the new--

17:55.674 --> 17:57.976
[overlapping shouts]

17:58.043 --> 18:00.279
- On second thought...

18:00.345 --> 18:01.580
{\an3}- Yeah.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.049
{\an3}I've got a better idea:
security measures!

18:05.384 --> 18:07.786
That'll show those
little sneaks.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.158
[purring]

18:15.894 --> 18:17.596
[gasps]
Rita!

18:17.663 --> 18:19.064
Look at this!

18:19.131 --> 18:21.433
{\an1}- Must be Lynn. She's
always way too aggressive

18:21.500 --> 18:22.434
with the roll.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.802
But how did she get in?

18:23.869 --> 18:25.337
{\an3}- Those kids are like master
safe crackers.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.873
What was I thinking,
just using one lock?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.076
[banging door]
- Dad!

18:31.143 --> 18:32.144
We're gonna be late for school!

18:32.211 --> 18:35.747
- Uh, just a second, buddy.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.417
Let's see 'em get past that.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.853
[fly buzzing]

18:41.753 --> 18:43.021
[slurps]

18:53.932 --> 18:56.034
- Dang it!
- Lincoln!

18:56.101 --> 18:58.036
{\an3}That kid always forgets
to put the seat up.

18:58.103 --> 18:59.705
{\an1}- Let's face it, honey.
They win.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.406
{\an3}- No way!

19:01.473 --> 19:02.674
- What else can we do?

19:02.741 --> 19:04.510
{\an1}Your security measures
obviously aren't working.

19:04.576 --> 19:07.379
- Maybe not, but I'm
just getting started.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.682
{\an1}There is no way they
can get past this.

19:10.749 --> 19:14.753
Surveillance camera, motion
sensor and check this out...

19:14.820 --> 19:16.855
Lasers, Rita! Lasers!

19:16.922 --> 19:18.657
And just in case
they do get in,

19:18.724 --> 19:21.627
{\an3}I've installed a security panel
on the inside.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.529
<i>- System lock engaged.</i>

19:23.595 --> 19:24.796
- So they won't get out.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.665
{\an1}We'll catch them with
their pants down!

19:26.732 --> 19:28.600
So to speak.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.602
[laughter]

19:32.137 --> 19:34.206
- How's the water
pressure, honey?

19:34.273 --> 19:36.975
{\an3}- Great! I'm loving
waterfall mode!

19:39.778 --> 19:42.247
- Whoops!
Forgot about my kid trap.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.550
[blip]

19:44.616 --> 19:47.185
Uh, hon, do you
remember the door code?

19:47.252 --> 19:50.489
- Uh, uh-uh. You said it was
one of the kids' birthdays.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.591
- I know, but which kid?

19:52.658 --> 19:54.026
[blip]

19:54.092 --> 19:56.962
"Too many password attempts.
Access blocked?"

19:57.029 --> 19:59.097
Rita, I need your help.
I locked us in!

19:59.164 --> 20:00.532
- What?! Hold on!

20:00.599 --> 20:01.667
[clank]

20:02.801 --> 20:04.036
Um, Lynn?

20:04.102 --> 20:06.638
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

20:06.705 --> 20:08.574
- Wow, you weren't kidding
about that water pressure.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.643
- Maybe I can pry the door
open with this toothbrush!

20:11.710 --> 20:12.945
[grunts]

20:13.011 --> 20:14.613
Oh, thanks for nothing,
Feinstein!

20:15.414 --> 20:17.783
Honey, wait! Don't forget
we wired the vents!

20:17.849 --> 20:19.918
[zap]
- [yelps]

20:19.985 --> 20:21.920
Dang it! Forgot about
that security measure.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.021
- What are we gonna do?

20:23.088 --> 20:24.790
- Laurie!
- Help!

20:24.856 --> 20:26.024
- Lisa! Help!

20:26.091 --> 20:27.993
- What's going on?
- Help!

20:28.060 --> 20:29.861
[stampeding]

20:29.928 --> 20:32.864
- Mom? Pops?
- Help! We're locked in!

20:32.931 --> 20:34.666
- What are you doing
in your closet?

20:34.733 --> 20:37.069
{\an3}- Probably just hangin'.
[laughs]

20:37.135 --> 20:40.806
- Uh, why the preponderance
of security devices?

20:40.872 --> 20:42.874
- Never mind that!
Just get us out!

20:42.941 --> 20:44.276
Break the door down
if you have to!

20:44.343 --> 20:46.445
- Now you're talking!

20:46.511 --> 20:47.846
Gangway!

20:47.913 --> 20:50.549
For honor! [screams]

20:50.616 --> 20:51.850
[rumbling]

20:51.917 --> 20:53.452
[screaming]

20:54.252 --> 20:56.188
{\an1}- Why is there water
in your closet?

20:56.254 --> 20:59.391
- Why is there a bathroom
in your closet?

20:59.458 --> 21:02.027
{\an3}- Uh, you--you didn't
know about it?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.028
{\an1}- No.
- Why would we?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.463
- This is weird.

21:04.529 --> 21:06.431
- Uh, care to explain?

21:06.498 --> 21:08.634
- We didn't want to wait
in line anymore

21:08.700 --> 21:10.002
so we built our own bathroom

21:10.068 --> 21:11.903
and we kept it a secret
from you guys.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.405
Which was wrong.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.674
{\an3}- Yeah, we're always telling
you kids to be patient

21:15.741 --> 21:16.942
and wait your turn,

21:17.009 --> 21:18.010
and here we cheated the system

21:18.076 --> 21:19.811
and put ourselves first.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.279
[sighs] We're really sorry.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.581
- To make it up to you,

21:22.648 --> 21:25.450
{\an1}you guys can use
the new bathroom anytime.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.654
- Too bad there isn't much of
a bathroom to use anymore.

21:29.488 --> 21:30.789
- Naw, you can fix it.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.125
You just need a new
subfloor and new tiling...

21:33.191 --> 21:35.227
[crash]
And a total re-pipe.

21:35.293 --> 21:36.528
- Ah, there's no money left!

21:36.595 --> 21:38.497
{\an3}I spent it all on
the security system.

21:38.563 --> 21:39.765
[both whimper]

21:39.831 --> 21:41.199
- Don't be sad.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.035
{\an1}You can still share
the upstairs bathroom with us.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.537
Right, guys?

21:46.371 --> 21:48.340
{\an3}- Even if we are going back
to one bathroom,

21:48.407 --> 21:51.143
{\an3}we sure have some ding-dang
terrific kids.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.882
[both panting]

21:56.948 --> 21:58.216
- Fish market emergency?

21:58.283 --> 22:00.352
- Nope.
I just really have to go.

22:00.419 --> 22:02.521
- Hey, Pops.
- Ah, there's no time!

22:02.587 --> 22:03.922
[groaning]

22:03.989 --> 22:06.091
