01:31.251 --> 01:32.718
- It was no
<i>- Gone with the Wind.</i>

01:32.753 --> 01:34.320
That's for sure.

01:34.354 --> 01:36.289
People need a little romance.

01:36.323 --> 01:38.391
Am I right?

01:39.857 --> 01:41.054
Richie?

01:41.079 --> 01:42.746
I-I didn't see it.

01:43.030 --> 01:44.664
You're kidding. No.

01:45.075 --> 01:46.475
Everyone saw that one.

01:48.774 --> 01:51.104
You ask me, Dorothy was
playing all of them guys.

01:51.693 --> 01:52.993
Especially the lion.

01:53.576 --> 01:55.156
I know girls like that.

01:55.229 --> 01:56.700
They get three, four guys

01:56.725 --> 01:58.980
wrapped around their fingers at a time.

01:59.287 --> 02:02.323
My roommates the type. Angie.

02:03.094 --> 02:05.098
She's not home.

02:05.345 --> 02:07.381
She works nights.

02:12.944 --> 02:14.915
Meters running, buddy.

02:17.465 --> 02:19.026
I should be getting home.

02:19.325 --> 02:23.194
I fly to Washington D.C. tomorrow.

02:23.231 --> 02:26.366
I have to pack and prepare.

02:30.430 --> 02:32.139
Hmm, well, all right.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.655
You give my regards to Mr. Roosevelt.

02:53.147 --> 02:55.007
Good night.

03:06.418 --> 03:09.088
Nice move, Casanova.

03:21.775 --> 03:24.477
Where the hell have you been all night?

03:31.263 --> 03:32.966
What are you doing here?

03:33.630 --> 03:34.936
I came by...

03:35.455 --> 03:37.097
Goddamn it.

03:37.229 --> 03:38.863
Are you okay?

03:38.958 --> 03:41.660
- Do you want to just...
- Let me.

03:45.829 --> 03:47.831
You were using the wrong key.

03:52.239 --> 03:54.672
I stayed up late last night thinking

03:54.785 --> 03:57.246
about why Mesulam would've
sent you instead of me.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.508
I have security clearance
from the propeller team.

03:59.810 --> 04:01.983
Doesn't matter what the reason is.

04:02.293 --> 04:04.463
Fortunately, I have a solution.

04:06.475 --> 04:07.901
- What is this?
- The proposal.

04:07.988 --> 04:09.043
Our proposal.

04:09.068 --> 04:10.389
Everything you would ever need to know

04:10.421 --> 04:13.026
about the potential of
rocketry is in those pages.

04:13.112 --> 04:14.392
Take it, study it.

04:14.417 --> 04:15.939
It'll be just like I'm
right there with you.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.572
Mesulam said that they were interested

04:17.603 --> 04:20.471
- in a more practical appli...
- Mesulam is limited.

04:20.744 --> 04:22.768
Okay? His vision, I mean.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.072
Don't forget, he was about to let you

04:24.097 --> 04:25.172
trade in your entire future

04:25.197 --> 04:26.897
- for fucking propellers.
- All I'm saying

04:26.922 --> 04:28.326
Is maybe we should hear what they want,

04:28.351 --> 04:30.020
before we start talking
talking about moon colonies.

04:30.044 --> 04:31.434
I told you what they want.

04:31.484 --> 04:33.434
Christ, I told <i> them</i> what they want.

04:33.459 --> 04:34.792
If you'd been there,
you would have seen

04:34.817 --> 04:36.706
Braxtons face light up.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.554
Look, I understand, you're
in a difficult situation.

04:41.625 --> 04:43.486
It's not fair.

04:43.959 --> 04:45.402
You're a gifted scientist, Richard,

04:45.427 --> 04:47.112
and I'll have words with
anyone who says otherwise.

04:47.136 --> 04:49.335
But lets face it: talking to people...

04:49.427 --> 04:51.129
is not your strong suit.

04:52.328 --> 04:54.249
That's not a criticism, it's a fact.

04:54.351 --> 04:55.921
But that's why you have me.

04:56.334 --> 04:59.030
And I promise you, this proposal

04:59.124 --> 05:00.893
is gonna get you through this.

05:01.179 --> 05:03.046
These are not men of imagination.

05:03.074 --> 05:05.752
They're soldiers, bureaucrats.

05:05.777 --> 05:08.675
Exactly, which is why it's not
enough to explain rocketry.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.848
You have to bend them to your will.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.988
You can do it, you just
have to believe you can.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.454
Belief has nothing to do with it.

05:14.508 --> 05:16.381
The-the data speaks for itself.

05:16.433 --> 05:17.620
Oh, boy.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.227
You think it's too late
for me to buy a ticket

05:19.252 --> 05:21.021
and come with you?

05:21.099 --> 05:23.949
I'm kidding. You think I
have that kind of dough?

05:25.041 --> 05:27.577
At least I'll be with you in spirit.

05:30.252 --> 05:32.852
It's hard to believe you're
actually gonna fly.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.876
I can't very well drive to D.C.

05:38.021 --> 05:39.541
I don't even own a car.

05:53.918 --> 05:57.445
Well, I think it's... fantastic.

05:59.572 --> 06:03.092
In fact, it's a hell of a thing.

08:54.431 --> 08:58.136
Here we go. Omelet de Parsons.

09:00.132 --> 09:01.504
You should try it.

09:01.587 --> 09:04.022
It tastes better than it looks.

09:04.474 --> 09:06.906
I'm not hungry.

09:07.992 --> 09:10.222
Are you gonna keep this up forever?

09:10.319 --> 09:12.452
- Please don't do that.
- Do what?

09:12.999 --> 09:15.286
Act like I'm the one who's
being unreasonable.

09:15.340 --> 09:18.310
You can't ask me to
stop going, not now.

09:18.937 --> 09:20.540
Not when our dreams are so close

09:20.565 --> 09:22.988
to finally becoming a reality.

09:25.777 --> 09:27.405
You know, if Richard succeeds,

09:27.430 --> 09:29.062
you'll be under more scrutiny.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.795
I'm told the military is very careful

09:30.820 --> 09:32.587
about what sort of
people they work with.

09:32.669 --> 09:33.829
I'm not entirely sure

09:33.854 --> 09:35.556
I understand what you mean by that.

09:35.581 --> 09:37.682
I think you understand perfectly.

09:42.304 --> 09:44.957
What do I have to do
for you to forgive me?

09:45.591 --> 09:48.177
There are some things
you can't forgive.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.935
That could be Richard.
I have to take it.

09:58.224 --> 10:00.944
Don't go. Okay? Please.

10:02.794 --> 10:04.384
Hello?

10:06.893 --> 10:08.881
No, I can hear you.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.712
I understand. One moment.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.741
It's Murphy. His cars broke down.

10:16.766 --> 10:18.869
He needs a ride to work.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.325
Should I tell him no?

10:22.579 --> 10:25.063
No, you should go.

10:25.563 --> 10:26.880
They've got me working a double shift.

10:26.905 --> 10:28.940
I'm gonna be home late.

10:29.332 --> 10:30.753
Okay.

10:41.025 --> 10:42.518
Where the hell have you been?

10:42.648 --> 10:45.783
I don't know, but
there's a shitload of water.

10:46.497 --> 10:48.150
Jack...

10:48.292 --> 10:49.777
Jack, are you with me?

10:50.205 --> 10:51.689
I'm right here.

10:53.468 --> 10:55.780
I-I think I might...

10:56.807 --> 10:58.635
I was thinking maybe I
ought to take a swim.

10:58.660 --> 11:00.529
No. Now, you listen to me.

11:01.810 --> 11:03.367
Hey.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.871
Ernest, are you still there?

11:06.502 --> 11:08.189
Can-can you bring a light?

11:08.239 --> 11:09.574
What?

11:10.364 --> 11:12.132
Ernest.

11:12.944 --> 11:15.175
I'm at Point Dume.

11:16.995 --> 11:19.917
Ernest. Ernest.

11:25.502 --> 11:26.824
- Here you go.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.359
You're welcome.

11:32.118 --> 11:33.723
First time?

11:33.951 --> 11:35.067
No.

11:35.092 --> 11:36.750
It's all right, son.

11:36.899 --> 11:39.135
I can always spot a greenhorn.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.729
If you ask me, this whole
enterprise is unnatural.

11:41.825 --> 11:44.095
Were thumbing our noses
at the Almighty himself.

11:44.222 --> 11:46.174
Hurtling through the
sky in tin coffins.

11:46.218 --> 11:47.886
Black magic's what it is.

11:49.996 --> 11:53.514
Actually, there's nothing
magical about it.

11:53.819 --> 11:56.454
A propeller creates lift,
in a forward direction...

11:56.487 --> 11:58.025
We call this thrust.

11:58.116 --> 12:00.095
The rotary motion through the air

12:00.120 --> 12:02.402
creates a difference in
pressure between the

12:02.427 --> 12:04.463
front and back surfaces
of the blades and...

12:08.845 --> 12:11.548
I thought I was scared my first time!

12:14.305 --> 12:16.141
Son, they're gonna identify your body

12:16.174 --> 12:18.209
by the shit in your britches!

12:59.216 --> 13:02.896
Hi, uh, Pueblo Powder
Company, Saugus, please?

13:06.696 --> 13:08.396
Hi. This is Susan Parsons.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.124
I need to speak to my
husband, Jack Parsons.

13:11.261 --> 13:13.330
It's an emergency.

13:18.429 --> 13:20.104
I see.

13:20.872 --> 13:23.474
Uh, um, yes.

13:24.116 --> 13:26.681
Uh, his mother is-is quite ill.

13:26.706 --> 13:30.058
It's... it's possible he went
to the hospital to see her.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.170
Yes, uh, so am I.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.580
He should've called to inform you.

13:39.263 --> 13:40.431
Please don't hold it against him,

13:40.456 --> 13:42.460
she really is quite sick.

14:14.092 --> 14:15.260
Come in.

14:21.577 --> 14:23.200
What is it?

14:26.289 --> 14:29.293
Well, you look as if you've
seen the devil himself.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.910
It's Jack.

14:32.944 --> 14:34.378
What's he done now?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.022
Susan?

14:47.966 --> 14:50.587
He's hurt himself at work.

14:50.612 --> 14:52.066
I need to go collect him.

14:52.188 --> 14:54.159
Well, why didn't you just say so?

14:54.212 --> 14:57.274
You had me worried
it was something far worse.

14:57.413 --> 15:00.184
Go, if you must.

15:02.637 --> 15:04.409
Thank you for understanding.

15:16.154 --> 15:17.927
Ernest?

15:22.993 --> 15:24.793
Ernest?!

15:45.916 --> 15:47.385
Ernest?!

15:50.327 --> 15:51.929
Ernest?!

16:00.736 --> 16:02.633
Ernest?!

16:06.670 --> 16:08.022
Jack Parsons!

16:08.279 --> 16:11.415
Come, brother, be baptized with me!

16:25.116 --> 16:27.103
I need your help.

16:27.432 --> 16:29.534
Button me up?

16:34.035 --> 16:36.267
Id ask if you felt it too,
but I don't have to ask.

16:36.861 --> 16:38.169
It's remarkable.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.935
I dare say there's a potency in you now

16:41.960 --> 16:43.407
that wasn't there before.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.377
There is.

16:45.502 --> 16:47.118
I take it you're making progress

16:47.143 --> 16:50.012
with Frater J.P.s scientist friend?

16:52.817 --> 16:55.756
You know what it is to
be adored, don't you?

16:55.910 --> 16:57.533
How it feels.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.497
You of all people must know.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.374
Love is the essential

17:01.399 --> 17:04.253
- companion to our will...
- No, not love.

17:04.376 --> 17:06.243
I'm not talking about love.

17:06.476 --> 17:08.468
I'm talking about...

17:10.487 --> 17:12.156
worship.

17:13.804 --> 17:17.002
To look in the eyes of
another and see their...

17:18.088 --> 17:21.053
it's... fear, isn't it?

17:21.104 --> 17:22.507
MARISOL...

17:22.626 --> 17:25.063
You don't know your power
until you see it reflected.

17:25.114 --> 17:28.584
Do not be misled by this illumination.

17:29.593 --> 17:33.157
Pursue your will unfettered.

17:33.498 --> 17:35.371
Help our friend discover his.

17:35.396 --> 17:40.435
But... do... not interfere with
the will of another.

17:41.332 --> 17:43.335
As our Master reminds us,

17:43.367 --> 17:48.339
collision is the only
crime in the cosmos.

17:49.303 --> 17:50.508
You're preaching again.

17:50.541 --> 17:53.324
I am telling you to be careful.

17:54.479 --> 17:55.859
Why?

17:55.971 --> 17:57.974
Who was ever careful with me?

17:59.143 --> 18:02.136
- Magus...
- I am in session.

18:02.161 --> 18:03.630
You'd better come now.

18:19.455 --> 18:21.188
- Ma'am, please calm down.
- Don't you dare touch me.

18:21.213 --> 18:22.807
- Please.
- Where's my husband?

18:22.949 --> 18:24.815
Jack! Jack!

18:24.982 --> 18:28.146
I tried to stop her, but
she pushed right past me.

18:28.652 --> 18:30.607
Where is he? Where's Jack?

18:30.654 --> 18:32.923
I assure you, Mrs.
Parsons, Jack isn't here.

18:33.031 --> 18:35.332
You can save your assurances
for these lemmings.

18:35.833 --> 18:38.238
These rats, crawling
into peoples homes,

18:38.263 --> 18:40.240
poisoning husbands and
wives against each other.

18:40.265 --> 18:41.400
Would you excuse us?

18:41.431 --> 18:44.233
Mrs. Parsons and I
require some privacy.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.505
I'm not afraid of you.

18:54.749 --> 18:56.069
Clearly.

18:56.132 --> 18:57.368
I came here for my husband.

18:57.393 --> 18:59.028
I told you, he isn't here.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.677
I don't believe you.

19:00.946 --> 19:03.147
I'm not leaving without him.

19:04.108 --> 19:06.717
Are you certain he's the
reason you're here?

19:07.731 --> 19:09.374
Jack!

19:10.370 --> 19:11.770
Are you in pain, Susan?

19:11.795 --> 19:13.714
No, I'm not in pain. I'm upset.

19:13.791 --> 19:15.882
And I'm going to call the police
this instant if you don't...

19:15.989 --> 19:17.295
What... don't touch me.

19:17.328 --> 19:19.302
Don't... let go.

19:26.697 --> 19:30.068
Here, yes?

19:33.695 --> 19:35.433
I said let me go.

19:42.551 --> 19:44.784
The ocean doesn't care who you are.

19:45.085 --> 19:48.225
It just holds you down.

19:48.878 --> 19:52.015
Shows you how meaningless you are.

19:53.531 --> 19:55.265
My eyes are open now.

19:55.424 --> 19:57.212
We don't spin the wheel.
The wheel spins us.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.104
Anybody tells you different
is selling something.

19:59.149 --> 20:00.664
What the hell are you talking about?

20:00.711 --> 20:03.569
You really think the
Grand Magus's hocus pocus

20:03.594 --> 20:06.347
is gonna make all your
wishes come true?

20:07.573 --> 20:09.880
Well, where's mine?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.916
I did everything that was asked of me.

20:13.158 --> 20:14.652
Where's my hearts desire?

20:14.685 --> 20:16.753
My destiny, my will?

20:19.873 --> 20:21.933
Look at me.

20:22.652 --> 20:24.340
Look.

20:28.229 --> 20:30.734
What do you see?

20:37.228 --> 20:39.745
I see a man who misses his wife.

21:00.076 --> 21:01.832
You see a fool.

21:02.285 --> 21:04.286
And I see one, too.

21:05.770 --> 21:07.672
This'll pass.

21:08.196 --> 21:09.313
All right?

21:09.577 --> 21:11.437
You'll get back on your feet.

21:11.489 --> 21:13.290
Your path is waiting for you.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.212
Richard got to fly up there.

21:20.276 --> 21:22.412
Above the clouds.

21:22.967 --> 21:25.719
Closer to the stars
than I've ever been.

21:26.906 --> 21:29.394
And it should have
been me on that plane.

21:30.296 --> 21:31.863
But I'll tell you this much.

21:32.009 --> 21:35.471
Not for one second do I
doubt the power of my will,

21:35.496 --> 21:36.885
because I know what's coming.

21:36.910 --> 21:38.077
I've seen the future.

21:38.102 --> 21:39.598
Well, bully for you, Jack.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.813
And maybe it's not the
future I pictured.

21:42.072 --> 21:44.097
Maybe it doesn't feel the
way it's supposed to feel.

21:44.122 --> 21:46.018
Maybe it doesn't even feel
like it's mine at all.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.063
- Then maybe it aint.
- Maybe you should let me finish.

21:48.104 --> 21:51.108
I'm not the enemy, Jack.

21:52.220 --> 21:55.621
Tomorrow, he'll be standing in D.C.
saying your words,

21:55.646 --> 21:57.165
occupying your shoes.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.927
Richards not my enemy, either.

21:59.017 --> 22:00.884
You keep telling yourself that.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.306
I wish I knew what to say

22:09.331 --> 22:10.845
to make it all better.

22:10.969 --> 22:12.458
But I don't have the answers.

22:12.524 --> 22:14.271
Nobody does.

22:14.450 --> 22:16.285
Not Alfred.

22:16.441 --> 22:18.594
Not the Agape.

22:19.834 --> 22:23.047
Not even the Great Beast himself.

22:33.428 --> 22:35.693
Truth is, Jack, were all alone.

22:35.779 --> 22:37.547
No, were not.

22:39.090 --> 22:42.343
It was you, Ernest. You
showed me my true path.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.938
And now, I'm standing on
the edge of my destiny.

22:51.841 --> 22:54.269
Means a lot that you came, Jack.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.277
Welcome, sir.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.706
- Good luck today.
- Thank you.

23:30.855 --> 23:32.582
Have a nice day.

23:34.770 --> 23:36.337
Good morning and welcome
to the Mayflower.

23:36.362 --> 23:37.404
How can I help you?

23:37.429 --> 23:39.765
Um, hi, yes. My name is Richard Onsted.

23:39.883 --> 23:42.533
I believe there is a reservation
here under my name.

23:42.585 --> 23:44.488
Institution?

23:44.694 --> 23:46.197
Institution?

23:47.127 --> 23:48.510
You are one of the scientists,

23:48.535 --> 23:49.892
come to talk with the
Department of War?

23:49.917 --> 23:51.179
- Yes.
- The reservations

23:51.204 --> 23:53.106
have been put under
your institutions name.

23:53.497 --> 23:55.865
Oh. Um, Caltech.

23:55.959 --> 23:56.987
What?

23:57.026 --> 23:59.997
Or, the California
Institute of Technology.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.506
Haven't heard of that one.

24:01.632 --> 24:04.535
Well, it's relatively new,
but very well-respected.

24:04.915 --> 24:06.983
I'm sure.

24:09.881 --> 24:12.744
Oh. There you are.

24:27.036 --> 24:28.283
It's a very nice room.

24:28.308 --> 24:30.593
It's completely up to my standards.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.346
Oh.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.613
Thank you very much.

24:50.638 --> 24:52.148
It's much appreciated.

25:27.565 --> 25:29.512
Susans gonna let me have
it with both barrels

25:29.537 --> 25:32.078
- when I get back.
- Oh, no, right now all we have

25:32.103 --> 25:34.282
Is the open road, the good music,

25:34.307 --> 25:36.843
the good booze, and no
earthly obligations.

25:36.933 --> 25:39.804
- Don't start on all that bullshit.
- She wouldn't leave me.

25:40.258 --> 25:41.697
- What - <i>if</i>
- She leaves me?

25:41.722 --> 25:44.184
Then you'll apologize
and she'll forgive you,

25:44.209 --> 25:45.304
and you'll both go on.

25:45.329 --> 25:46.763
I sleep in the garage, Ernest.

25:46.930 --> 25:49.632
Whew! She says I can't
come back to my own bed

25:49.657 --> 25:51.358
until I give up Thelema.

25:51.441 --> 25:53.707
Even now, after all it's done for us.

25:53.978 --> 25:58.279
There is no way to live
honestly with a woman.

25:58.337 --> 26:01.168
In fact, I reject the
entire institution.

26:01.338 --> 26:02.828
Marriage is false.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.935
Tyranny of this so-called free society.

26:06.069 --> 26:07.710
There's the Ernest I know.

26:07.812 --> 26:09.383
Seemed like you were
done with all that.

26:09.408 --> 26:11.278
- Hell does that mean?
- Nothin'.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.403
Just last night you were...

26:12.428 --> 26:14.131
You never had a moment of doubt?

26:14.164 --> 26:16.967
- Settle down.
- I was tested, Jack. It was a test.

26:17.086 --> 26:19.336
Do we shrink from our
destiny and became small

26:19.368 --> 26:21.003
like other men, or do we ascend?

26:21.028 --> 26:22.217
I ascend!

26:22.305 --> 26:24.340
I'm goddamn ascending right now!

26:24.449 --> 26:27.151
Can you keep your eyes on the
road while you're ascending?

26:27.791 --> 26:29.702
Yes!

26:36.934 --> 26:39.636
Hey, wake me up when we
get there, all right?

28:17.171 --> 28:19.073
<i>Gentlemen, I have come here</i>

28:19.106 --> 28:21.683
to show you something
that you haven't seen...

28:21.859 --> 28:23.683
before today:

28:24.908 --> 28:26.637
The future.

28:31.868 --> 28:33.803
"Future."

28:46.428 --> 28:48.497
Long distance, please.

28:49.693 --> 28:50.942
To Los Angeles.

28:50.967 --> 28:52.985
Glenview 7537.

28:54.251 --> 28:57.605
And, um, exactly how much...
will that cost?

29:00.176 --> 29:01.749
Per minute?

29:03.246 --> 29:04.948
I see.

29:05.969 --> 29:07.286
Yes, Id like to connect.

29:14.492 --> 29:16.426
<i>Connecting from Washington, D.C.</i>

29:16.859 --> 29:18.095
Well, hello there, Richie.

29:18.128 --> 29:21.365
Yes, I'm calling from
Washington, long distance.

29:21.607 --> 29:22.970
Look, we need to be brief.

29:23.032 --> 29:25.125
You wouldn't believe how much
they charge per minute,

29:25.150 --> 29:27.649
and I've got my
presentation in an hour.

29:29.279 --> 29:32.203
Um, I-I'm calling because...

29:33.176 --> 29:35.267
I want you to know that...

29:42.386 --> 29:44.811
I'm not a great man, MARISOL.

29:45.108 --> 29:48.913
I'm not... Washington or Lincoln.

29:49.292 --> 29:50.809
<i>I'm just trying very hard</i>

29:50.834 --> 29:52.803
to be a scientist of some...

29:52.828 --> 29:54.504
of <i>any</i> significance,

29:54.529 --> 29:56.085
and that is gonna come to an end today,

29:56.110 --> 29:58.171
because I-I don't know how
to talk to these people.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.325
You mean the Army people?

29:59.350 --> 30:00.619
The Army people...

30:00.997 --> 30:03.839
other people, any people, MARISOL.

30:03.947 --> 30:05.853
Jack, he's the one, he's
the salesman. I...

30:05.878 --> 30:07.613
<i>Don't be silly, Richie.</i>

30:07.684 --> 30:09.520
<i>You make quite an impression.</i>

30:09.719 --> 30:11.956
You certainly did on me.

30:14.350 --> 30:16.694
The other night in the taxi...

30:17.959 --> 30:19.827
I didn't know what to say.

30:20.676 --> 30:22.107
I didn't know the...

30:22.191 --> 30:24.527
the right words.

30:25.418 --> 30:27.625
But I-I knew that you
wanted me to say something

30:27.650 --> 30:29.419
or-or do something.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.288
Settle down, darling.

30:31.313 --> 30:33.750
Just listen to my voice.

30:33.902 --> 30:35.407
You know what I was thinking

30:35.533 --> 30:38.057
when it was just you
and me in that taxi?

30:38.475 --> 30:40.045
I was thinking:

30:40.179 --> 30:43.173
this Richard, he's <i>so</i> smart.

30:43.352 --> 30:44.805
<i>That great big brain of his</i>

30:44.830 --> 30:46.796
<i>is gonna change the world someday.</i>

30:47.143 --> 30:49.049
<i>Anything I can imagine,</i>

30:49.074 --> 30:50.499
<i>he could make real.</i>

30:50.593 --> 30:52.562
<i>Like that guy in the movie.</i>

30:52.729 --> 30:53.997
<i>The Wizard.</i>

30:54.050 --> 30:55.385
But...

30:55.559 --> 30:57.191
the Wizard is a fraud.

30:57.321 --> 30:59.184
<i>You know what else I was thinking?</i>

30:59.442 --> 31:01.010
No.

31:01.272 --> 31:03.239
<i>I was thinking:</i>

31:03.353 --> 31:06.768
<i>if he wanted to take
me inside, right now,</i>

31:06.883 --> 31:09.543
I wouldn't be able to behave myself.

31:14.024 --> 31:15.350
Oh.

31:15.445 --> 31:16.947
<i>Well...</i>

31:17.314 --> 31:19.590
<i>good luck, Mr. Wizard.</i>

31:40.971 --> 31:42.217
Found it.

31:42.306 --> 31:43.630
Here's the one.

31:44.650 --> 31:46.609
I haven't any cake.

31:46.837 --> 31:49.180
- If Id known you were coming...
- It's all right.

31:49.297 --> 31:52.102
I haven't been to market
because of my back.

31:52.221 --> 31:55.419
I tripped on the walkway...
the stones are broken, and...

31:55.652 --> 31:59.013
these people, they can't
be bothered to fix it.

31:59.121 --> 32:01.868
Oh, look at that face.

32:02.055 --> 32:03.954
Handsome.

32:04.060 --> 32:06.459
Such a serious boy.

32:06.764 --> 32:09.921
He wasn't one to smile,
not even for his mother.

32:10.073 --> 32:12.176
He's alone in most of these.

32:12.369 --> 32:15.761
Jack kept to himself... he
was always independent,

32:15.786 --> 32:18.123
save for his friend Richard.

32:19.195 --> 32:23.066
I'm so pleased you've finally
taken an interest.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.356
This was my father, Walter H.

32:27.381 --> 32:30.977
He was president of the
Allis-Chalmers mining company.

32:32.121 --> 32:35.048
My mother was a Bayes.

32:36.326 --> 32:37.620
That name...

32:37.688 --> 32:39.955
means something in Ohio.

32:40.130 --> 32:43.150
Uh, slow down, slow down, dear.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.707
Father always loved
his harvest parties.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.994
He invited everyone,
even the domestics.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.157
There I am.

32:53.371 --> 32:55.682
Don't ever be pregnant in August.

32:58.407 --> 32:59.983
Is that...?

33:00.434 --> 33:02.239
I just realized...

33:02.412 --> 33:04.246
I do have some shortbread.

33:04.287 --> 33:06.127
This is Jacks father, isn't it?

33:06.310 --> 33:07.479
Marvel?

33:07.697 --> 33:09.084
Ruth, please.

33:09.139 --> 33:10.808
I found this in the garage.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.669
Jack hardly ever talks about him.

33:15.453 --> 33:17.121
For good reason.

33:18.432 --> 33:20.376
Please, I don't mean to pry. I...

33:20.907 --> 33:23.108
I'm just worried about Jack.

33:23.373 --> 33:24.830
I think maybe he's gotten himself

33:24.855 --> 33:26.163
in with the wrong sort of people and...

33:26.188 --> 33:27.489
What is this talk?

33:27.985 --> 33:29.986
Jack didn't come home last night.

33:30.427 --> 33:32.962
I don't know where he's
gone, and I thought, I...

33:33.069 --> 33:34.905
I know his father...

33:36.461 --> 33:38.341
- Was there any sign? I mean...
- Oh.

33:38.395 --> 33:40.230
- ...before he left?
- They're not the same.

33:40.255 --> 33:43.499
Marvel Parsons was born
with the devil inside him.

33:44.519 --> 33:46.450
Jack is an angel.

33:46.536 --> 33:50.207
All he's ever wanted is to
travel among the stars.

33:51.368 --> 33:53.165
I'm at my wits end.

33:53.798 --> 33:56.167
I don't know what to do.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.679
You're a woman, aren't you?

34:00.925 --> 34:02.792
Give him a bed to be in.

34:03.364 --> 34:05.593
And for heavens sakes, the first
thing a wife ought to know

34:05.618 --> 34:07.654
is where her husband goes at night.

34:14.263 --> 34:16.850
They let the fruit fall
from the tree, to rot.

34:16.938 --> 34:18.908
Rot, do you see?

34:19.362 --> 34:21.350
Brings the vermin.

34:22.578 --> 34:25.159
Truth is, not everyone
deserves property.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.245
There's a basket in the garden shed...

34:28.270 --> 34:30.039
Would you be a dear?

34:34.016 --> 34:35.599
Of course.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.362
Sign in.

35:58.721 --> 36:01.766
I'm Richard Onsted, from Caltech.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.780
Sign in.

36:16.699 --> 36:18.726
Atkins, they're ready for you.

36:18.863 --> 36:20.332
Right here, sir.

36:24.019 --> 36:25.489
Gentlemen...

36:37.367 --> 36:40.404
But then the third... the
third presentation...

36:52.434 --> 36:54.860
- Ready when you are, Mr. Onsted.
- Yes, sir.

36:54.938 --> 36:56.306
I'll be using the projector.

36:56.474 --> 36:58.389
Well, be quick about it.
I'm hungry enough

36:58.414 --> 37:00.550
to eat the balls off a low-flying duck.

37:14.837 --> 37:17.206
I am the Wizard.

37:18.775 --> 37:20.812
Gentlemen, I have come
here to show you something

37:20.837 --> 37:22.871
you haven't seen before today:

37:24.247 --> 37:25.913
The future.

37:37.479 --> 37:39.960
There's been a great deal of sensation

37:39.985 --> 37:41.466
and some confusion

37:41.491 --> 37:44.980
as to what my team does at GALCIT.

37:45.768 --> 37:48.282
I assure you I have
spent plenty of time

37:48.339 --> 37:50.007
explaining to people
that we do not deal

37:50.032 --> 37:52.188
in science fiction at Caltech.

37:52.323 --> 37:56.560
We deal in the practical
application of technology,

37:57.054 --> 37:59.353
which, when done right,

37:59.537 --> 38:03.330
can appear equally miraculous.

38:04.722 --> 38:05.953
Which is why, gentlemen,

38:05.978 --> 38:08.581
I have not come here
to talk about rockets.

38:10.292 --> 38:14.404
I've come here to talk
about jet propulsion.

38:29.567 --> 38:31.100
Jack.

38:33.803 --> 38:34.997
How long was I out?

38:35.022 --> 38:36.224
Awhile. I took a detour.

38:36.249 --> 38:38.316
Come on, you got to see this.

38:40.744 --> 38:42.278
Come on.

38:52.755 --> 38:54.035
Almost there.

38:54.243 --> 38:56.649
- Where?
- Come on.

39:02.478 --> 39:04.291
You're gonna get us both shot.

39:04.341 --> 39:07.151
Are you on your true path or not?

39:07.718 --> 39:10.397
It's a beautiful bird, Jack.

39:18.380 --> 39:20.650
Faster, Jack. Hustle!

39:23.899 --> 39:25.768
Come on now!

39:27.951 --> 39:30.186
Come on, come on, come on.

39:35.947 --> 39:37.754
Wow.

39:37.935 --> 39:40.337
Here, put your foot here.

39:40.577 --> 39:42.215
No, no, I don't need to get in.

39:42.300 --> 39:43.921
Ah, come on. Don't be a sissy.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.898
See what it feels like.

39:46.383 --> 39:48.149
I'm not leaving till you do.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.780
All right, just one minute
and then we leave, okay?

39:53.429 --> 39:54.669
Wow.

39:54.735 --> 39:56.719
Keep your head down.

40:01.409 --> 40:02.896
- Okay, thanks. Can we go?
- Lets see here.

40:02.921 --> 40:05.160
You got throttles, elevators, bags.

40:07.127 --> 40:09.329
- Stop screwing around.
- I can drive a stock car.

40:09.354 --> 40:10.906
How hard can this be?

40:11.035 --> 40:12.348
What the hell are you doing?

40:12.373 --> 40:15.612
Richards not the only one
who's gonna get to fly.

40:17.047 --> 40:18.347
Shit.

40:18.487 --> 40:19.819
Ernest.

40:20.782 --> 40:22.409
Hold on to your britches!

40:23.667 --> 40:25.219
Ernest, stop, stop!

40:25.668 --> 40:27.369
Oh, my God.

40:32.902 --> 40:34.503
No, no, no, no!

40:35.992 --> 40:38.894
Yeah, Jack! Were going up there!

40:44.627 --> 40:47.697
Oh, my God! Whoo!

40:48.217 --> 40:49.786
Yeah!

41:19.074 --> 41:20.750
Thanks again for the lift.

41:20.784 --> 41:23.348
Are you kidding? Thank you.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.158
You're not sore I didn't tell you?

41:25.183 --> 41:27.320
What, that you'd flown one before?

41:27.411 --> 41:30.658
No, that would've taken
some of the fun out of it.

41:36.131 --> 41:37.700
You gonna be all right?

41:37.841 --> 41:39.950
Maybe we should've just kept on flying.

41:40.043 --> 41:43.347
Would've run out of gas and
crash-landed eventually.

41:44.119 --> 41:46.354
We did, anyway.

41:55.189 --> 41:56.424
What happened?

41:56.509 --> 41:57.603
Come on, spit it out.

41:57.628 --> 41:58.831
Did they bite or didn't they?

41:58.874 --> 42:00.542
<i>Well, yes, in a sense.</i>

42:03.593 --> 42:06.396
<i>I knew it! What did they say?</i>

42:20.136 --> 42:22.743
What the hell are you talking
about, an alternate proposal?

42:22.812 --> 42:24.376
I told you exactly what to say.

42:24.401 --> 42:26.263
This was the only way, Jack.

42:26.503 --> 42:27.710
They didn't want rockets.

42:27.735 --> 42:29.003
They wanted a way for planes

42:29.028 --> 42:30.247
to take off from shorter runways.

42:30.272 --> 42:32.174
I don't give a damn what they wanted.

42:32.647 --> 42:34.432
I saw the Moon, Richard,

42:34.489 --> 42:35.849
with my own two eyes

42:35.874 --> 42:37.869
and I saw that our work
was gonna get us there.

42:37.894 --> 42:41.726
And you traded that for "solid
fuel propellant canisters"

42:41.751 --> 42:43.103
for fixed-wing attachment"?

42:43.128 --> 42:44.240
See, this is exactly why

42:44.265 --> 42:45.868
I didn't say anything to you before.

42:45.921 --> 42:48.859
You can't see past your own obsessions.

42:49.045 --> 42:52.222
Having a vision of going up to the Moon

42:52.247 --> 42:53.849
doesn't make it any less impossible,

42:53.874 --> 42:57.025
but this is something that we
can actually achieve right now.

42:57.266 --> 42:59.571
Look. Look.

43:00.449 --> 43:02.008
Look at this.

43:08.609 --> 43:10.850
Okay, we can still fix this.

43:11.662 --> 43:13.664
We can put some of this
money towards our...

43:14.185 --> 43:16.171
- real goal.
- No, Jack.

43:16.243 --> 43:17.433
For the first time ever,

43:17.458 --> 43:19.663
someone other than us
believes in our work.

43:19.688 --> 43:22.574
- We can't betray that...
- I was the one who believed.

43:23.166 --> 43:25.701
I was the one who never wavered.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.402
And what do you do with that belief?

43:27.427 --> 43:30.342
You... sold it to the highest bidder!

43:30.414 --> 43:32.548
Are you out of your goddamn mind?!

43:32.722 --> 43:34.182
I've never been clearer, Richard.

43:34.207 --> 43:35.942
I see you for what you really are.

43:35.992 --> 43:38.752
They were never gonna go for
your preposterous ideas, Jack.

43:38.821 --> 43:42.042
Why is it you think Braxton
and Mesulam sent me to D.C.?

43:42.371 --> 43:45.989
Hmm? They needed someone
they could trust

43:46.014 --> 43:47.716
to give a sensible presentation

43:47.791 --> 43:50.086
that was relevant to the
state of the world.

43:50.172 --> 43:52.923
An actual scientist, not
someone who believes

43:52.948 --> 43:55.251
that they can will
things into existence.

43:55.312 --> 43:57.620
I don't expect you to understand.

43:59.377 --> 44:02.047
You can't. It's just not in you.

44:02.104 --> 44:04.039
You sound like a lunatic.

44:04.147 --> 44:06.512
Y-You've been spending too
much time with that lunatic.

44:06.537 --> 44:08.136
Don't bring him into this!

44:08.243 --> 44:10.298
He's done more for me
in the last 24 hours

44:10.323 --> 44:11.857
than you've done in the last 15 years.

44:11.888 --> 44:14.492
You're delusional.
Everyone sees it but you.

44:14.597 --> 44:16.899
Who sees it? Huh?

44:17.576 --> 44:19.468
Hmm? Who sees it?

44:20.323 --> 44:22.228
Your esteemed colleagues?

44:22.965 --> 44:25.437
You crunch numbers, Richard,
and call them ideas.

44:25.515 --> 44:28.851
You're not a visionary. You're
a fucking calculator.

44:35.979 --> 44:37.829
You know what I think, Jack?

44:39.662 --> 44:42.052
I think you're pissed about the money

44:42.661 --> 44:44.954
because I'm the one who got it.

44:45.532 --> 44:48.455
It happened in spite of
you, not because of you.

44:49.392 --> 44:51.795
And after all this time and...

44:52.452 --> 44:54.807
after all of your grandstanding

44:55.079 --> 44:57.414
and your flailing in the dark,

44:58.067 --> 45:00.076
I am the one who made it real,

45:00.101 --> 45:02.276
not you. Me.

45:04.061 --> 45:06.481
You didn't make it real.

45:07.612 --> 45:09.833
You made it small.

46:15.945 --> 46:18.958
A ka...

46:19.424 --> 46:22.426
dua.

46:23.345 --> 46:26.389
A ka...

47:02.826 --> 47:04.293
Hello, Mrs. Parsons.

47:04.326 --> 47:06.128
How did you know about my wrist?

47:06.305 --> 47:07.751
Did Jack tell you?

47:07.998 --> 47:09.318
No.

47:10.139 --> 47:12.141
I merely paid attention.

47:12.702 --> 47:15.304
You don't even know when
you're doing it, do you?

47:15.418 --> 47:17.486
I notice when a person
is uncomfortable,

47:17.511 --> 47:19.348
holding something inside.

47:19.668 --> 47:23.872
Memories, desires, regrets.

47:24.849 --> 47:26.668
These things manifest in our body.

47:26.693 --> 47:30.063
They live in our bones.
They make us restless.

47:30.261 --> 47:32.151
They cause us pain.

47:32.621 --> 47:34.175
I don't believe in any of that.

47:34.282 --> 47:36.199
The truth doesn't care
if you believe in it.

47:36.379 --> 47:39.107
It simply exists whether
we want it to or not.

47:39.316 --> 47:41.785
Most of the time, we don't.

47:42.350 --> 47:44.250
Yesterday you held my wrist and...

47:44.327 --> 47:46.333
Please, sit down.

47:53.990 --> 47:56.136
Are you in pain right now?

47:57.079 --> 47:59.382
Pain? No.

48:00.549 --> 48:02.384
Hmm.

48:07.982 --> 48:09.784
Are you in pain?

48:12.535 --> 48:14.376
I don't know.

48:15.502 --> 48:17.000
I suppose I was.

48:17.259 --> 48:18.943
My wrist was.

48:20.309 --> 48:22.271
I type a lot at my job.

48:22.384 --> 48:24.474
At times it's bad.

48:25.664 --> 48:27.576
Excruciating, in fact.

48:29.824 --> 48:31.730
It was yesterday, but...

48:32.549 --> 48:35.127
but then you put your
hands on me and...

48:37.318 --> 48:38.587
Yes?

48:39.815 --> 48:41.891
It went away.

48:50.298 --> 48:51.379
What exactly are you doing?

48:51.404 --> 48:53.079
Did you come here for your husband?

48:53.149 --> 48:55.289
Yes, I told you I was looking for Jack.

48:55.361 --> 48:57.129
Did you come here for your husband?

48:57.180 --> 48:58.293
He didn't come home last night.

48:58.318 --> 48:59.987
I have no idea where he is.

49:00.012 --> 49:01.370
He's not here. You know that.

49:01.426 --> 49:03.551
I do know that, but I thought
that maybe you might...

49:03.583 --> 49:07.442
Did... you come here for your husband?

49:23.967 --> 49:26.436
Did you come here for your husband?

49:32.976 --> 49:34.610
No.

49:34.916 --> 49:37.318
Why are you here, Susan?

49:39.422 --> 49:41.083
I think...

49:45.054 --> 49:49.491
I think... something might
be wrong with me.

49:52.395 --> 49:54.522
I need to be fixed.

49:56.699 --> 49:58.712
Can you do that?

50:00.961 --> 50:02.419
No.

50:10.704 --> 50:14.651
Because you are not broken.
