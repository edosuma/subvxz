But I must say,
we are prepared to discuss
how to make it go away.

a little more rational.

Why didn't you say
he was retarded?

- [ Eraser Rubbing ]
-It happened outside the station
just 15 minutes ago.

Ken.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.666
- Hey.
- Oh, um--

40:36.067 --> 40:40.872
The eyes are a bit weird.
You have a go.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.043
I got started.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.947
[ Man ]
His wife is here.
She posted bail.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.917
Time pass slow in there,
don't it?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.754
It's like it stands still.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.157
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:59.190 --> 41:04.796
My friend Kay,
she used to sing to me,
make the time go.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.932
You know what she'd sing?
What?

41:08.166 --> 41:12.804
* Jesus loves me
This I know *

41:12.838 --> 41:15.974
* For the Bible

41:17.876 --> 41:22.080
* Little things
to him belong *
[ Sniffling ]

* They are weak

41:28.554 --> 41:32.157
[ Crying ]
We'd look up,

41:32.190 --> 41:35.126
and what do you know,
five minutes'd be gone.

41:37.262 --> 41:42.000
That's how you
break the day up--
in little pieces like that.

41:42.033 --> 41:45.804
[ Door Closes ]
Well, I ain't heard that song
since I was a little girl.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.239
Paperwork's done.

41:48.273 --> 41:51.677
Free as a bird.
Not you.

It's okay, baby.

Dad, where were you?

42:01.920 --> 42:06.625
Where's Ken?
He walked home about
15 minutes ago.

[ Sighs ]
[ Woman ]
You'll be glad to know...

42:08.927 --> 42:11.597
we feel no need
to put this on
her permanent record.

42:11.630 --> 42:14.633
You know, with you-all
bein' so willing to
enroll her in our program,

42:14.666 --> 42:16.868
there's plenty of hope
for her to be rehabilitated.

42:16.902 --> 42:19.671
Well, thank you so much.

42:19.705 --> 42:23.742
Mr. Rich seems
a little stressed,
if you don't mind my saying.

[ Car Alarm Chirps ]

42:33.652 --> 42:35.754
you were
magnificent in there.

42:35.787 --> 42:39.791
Totally smooth, calm.
Above it all.

42:39.825 --> 42:42.193
- Like a queen.

I can't do this.

Ooh, I can't do this anymore.

43:10.188 --> 43:13.091
You know,
we certainly can't get enough
of the folk dances here.

43:13.124 --> 43:16.394
Next up, the Briggs Sisters.
Please don't go away.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.697
Hey, Daddy.
Hmm?

What the hell
are you watchin'?

43:24.970 --> 43:27.205
Day nurse put this on?

43:27.238 --> 43:30.208
Lame-ass polka shit.

43:32.243 --> 43:36.214
You must be sick as hell of
being cooped up in here all day.

43:39.985 --> 43:43.354
You must be dyin'
for some fresh air.
[ Inhales Deeply ]

43:46.091 --> 43:49.160
Oh, no, no.
No, don't tire yourself out.

43:49.194 --> 43:51.229
I got you.

43:59.204 --> 44:02.808
It's cold tonight.
Look at them stars, Daddy.

44:02.841 --> 44:07.045
How come y'all can see the stars
better when it's cold?

44:07.078 --> 44:10.181
When I was a kid,
I used to think that
the stars were made of ice.

44:10.215 --> 44:12.751
Do you remember that?
We'd go camping.

44:12.784 --> 44:15.420
You'd let me pretend
we were Indians.

44:15.453 --> 44:18.123
You gave us Indian names.
You were Big Elk.

44:18.156 --> 44:20.191
Remember what
you used to call me?

44:20.225 --> 44:23.128
That's right.
I was Little Bear.

We'd set up our tent,
and you'd tell me the stories
about the Ridge Runner.

[ Shivering ]

44:42.814 --> 44:44.950
Crazy Indian who lost his tribe,

44:44.983 --> 44:48.019
and he would haunt
these woods,
scalpin' little boys.

44:49.755 --> 44:52.758
And after you went to sleep,

44:56.261 --> 44:58.897
I would lie there so scared.

made a sound.
