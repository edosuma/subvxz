WEBVTT

00:03.404 --> 00:06.271
         - So who gets
        the last waffle?

00:06.273 --> 00:08.607
      - Oh, well, I think
   it should go to the person

00:08.609 --> 00:11.310
   Who was the most sexually
   extraordinary last night,

00:11.312 --> 00:12.277
           Don't you?

00:12.279 --> 00:14.246
     - I agree. Thank you.
            - Okay.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.547
     Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
         You were good,

00:15.549 --> 00:19.218
     But, um, I think I was
   just a little bit better.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.352
           - [laughs]

00:20.354 --> 00:22.621
    You're full of yourself
         this morning.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.224
     I was wondering if you
   would do something for me.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.292
    - I'm trying to imagine
  what I wouldn't do for you.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.328
           - Mm-hmm.
       - No, I'd do that.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.363
             - Mm?
     - Definitely do that.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.298
      That I'd have to be
       pretty drunk for,

00:33.300 --> 00:35.200
   And even then, it would be
        a little dicey.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.136
      - Yeah, not that...
              Yet.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.105
           - [laughs]
            - soon.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.107
       No, there's a gala
        for the hospital

00:42.109 --> 00:44.309
       Sunday afternoon,
 and I'd love for you to come.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.311
   - A gala for the hospital?

00:46.313 --> 00:48.447
           - Mm-hmm.
           - That...

00:48.449 --> 00:49.448
    Shouldn't be a problem.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.549
    - My boss will be there.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.217
          It's kind of
       a big-deal event.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.485
   - Yeah, that shouldn't be
           a problem.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.254
       - I go every year.
           - Mm-hmm.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.655
       - And it's always
           plus-one.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.390
  And everyone's always like,
    "where's your plus-one?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.558
    Why are you here alone?"

00:59.560 --> 01:01.460
      And I just never had
           a plus-one

01:01.462 --> 01:03.395
    That I wanted to bring.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.663
      And this year I do.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.398
       - That shouldn't--
    shouldn't be a problem.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.367
         - That's three
   "shouldn't be a problems"

01:08.369 --> 01:09.501
            And zero
      "I'd love to come."

01:09.503 --> 01:10.836
        - Three to zero?
           - Mm-hmm.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.371
      - That was the score
  of the a's game last night.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.772
        - Well, I know.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.076
          - Hey, will!

01:17.078 --> 01:18.310
             - Mm.
           - Oh, hey!

01:18.312 --> 01:19.645
       Hey, bud, little--
          busy times.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.080
          Busy times.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.648
 - I just wanted to remind you
        that my birthday

01:22.650 --> 01:24.083
       Is this Saturday.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.551
        - Got it. Okay.
      We'll see you later.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.219
         - Hi, dr. Sam.
             - Hey.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.588
      - You must've gotten
          here early.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.858
     Is that will's shirt?
    It fits you differently.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.560
      Oh, sweet, a waffle!

01:34.562 --> 01:36.395
         - Okay, buddy,
    I'm gonna circle around

01:36.397 --> 01:38.297
     The old birthday thing
    and figure something out

01:38.299 --> 01:40.165
       That's real good,
      and in the meantime,

01:40.167 --> 01:41.867
     I'd like you to leave.
          - It's fine.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.402
        You can give me
      my present anytime.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.770
    I'm not having a party.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.672
    - What--what do you mean
   you're not having a party?

01:46.674 --> 01:48.707
      - New kids at school
 don't typically throw parties,

01:48.709 --> 01:51.243
    Especially when they're
  convinced no one will come.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.244
      - I don't even want
          to hear it.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.879
   I'm talking to your <i> madre,</i>

01:53.881 --> 01:55.881
    And we are throwing you
         a bash, okay?

01:55.883 --> 01:58.317
      Now scram, for real.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.653
- Oh, marcus, are you pressuring
    will into giving you a--

02:01.655 --> 02:02.788
        Oh, hello, sam.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.289
    Didn't see you there...
             - Hi.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.525
     - Pants-less in front
       of my 11-year-old.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.594
   - Well, she's in my house,
     and it's the morning.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.728
             - Eh.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.531
              Oy!
    Are you eating a waffle?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.299
        - One can dream.
           - Will...

02:14.301 --> 02:15.868
         You know he is
       gluten intolerant.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.269
         - Yeah, I know
    he's gluten intolerant,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.404
        But to be fair,
     I'm not exactly clear

02:19.406 --> 02:22.307
  - Well, how does he normally
       react to gluten--

02:22.309 --> 02:26.311
 - It was, like, sexy in here,
     like, 20 seconds ago.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.615
 - I get none of those symptoms
  when I eat gluten at will's.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.283
     Maybe will is my cure.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.852
- If you haven't had him tested,
       you might want to,

02:33.854 --> 02:35.654
       Just to make sure.
             - Mm.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.222
    Darling, could you just

02:37.224 --> 02:38.857
   Hop back through the wall,
            please?

02:38.859 --> 02:41.293
- I think I'm, uh--I'm gonna go
      put some clothes on.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.294
         - Yeah, okay.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.228
     This has got to stop.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.797
            - What?
         Now, listen...

02:45.799 --> 02:49.535
 We have a no-store-bought-gift
     policy in our family.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.370
    I would actually love it

02:51.372 --> 02:53.372
         And be shocked
      if you honored that.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.440
      - We're gonna table
     the whole gift thing.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.609
      We are throwing him
            a party.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.845
    - It's--it's a very nice
          idea, will,

02:59.847 --> 03:02.314
     But you can't imagine
          how painful

03:02.316 --> 03:04.583
    Marcus' birthday parties
           have been.

03:04.585 --> 03:09.688
 Pin the tail on the wrong part
         of the donkey?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.524
    - On his fifth birthday,
      I got him a hamster,

03:12.526 --> 03:15.327
  But I forgot to troubleshoot
      the neighbors' cat.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.764
    So he ended up watching
    his present be ingested.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.432
    On his eighth birthday,

03:20.434 --> 03:22.568
        I got this clown
      to come and perform,

03:22.570 --> 03:23.669
    But it turned out he had

03:23.671 --> 03:25.370
      Surprisingly fierce
        political views,

03:25.372 --> 03:26.905
   And he ended up egging me.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.474
           Last year
    might've been the worst.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.244
   I substituted baby carrots
        and apple slices

03:32.246 --> 03:33.879
     For candy in a piñata,

03:33.881 --> 03:35.847
        Which I thought
       was a lovely idea.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.783
      - [quietly] it was.
  - I can't really talk about

03:37.785 --> 03:39.284
       The ensuing melee.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.719
         Let's just say
      we're in a new city.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.287
      It's a fresh start.

03:42.289 --> 03:43.589
    If we throw him a party,

03:43.591 --> 03:46.458
          It cannot be
 another birthday catastrophe.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.327
    - I know you're worried
   that no kids will show up,

03:48.329 --> 03:49.928
         But they will,
       and I'll be there,

03:49.930 --> 03:53.665
     And will at your party
    means fun at your party.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.734
     - Is that your slogan?
      - Yeah, it could be.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.402
         - Here we go.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.539

since fiona sent out the e-vite,

04:28.802 --> 04:29.835
     And no one is coming.

04:29.837 --> 04:33.905
        But if I can get
 this cool kid jackson to come,

04:33.907 --> 04:36.675
      - I'm so creeped out
      by what we're doing.

04:36.677 --> 04:40.679
      We're two grown men
     lurking outside of a--

04:40.681 --> 04:41.813
         Hello, ma'am.
          How are you?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.448
      Yeah, we're waiting
         for our child.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.917
        Lurking outside
      of a middle school,

04:45.919 --> 04:48.520
  Waiting to accost some child
    that we don't even know

04:48.522 --> 04:50.355
      So we can invite him
      to marcus' birthday.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.958
      - We're not lurking.
We're just standing here, okay?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.293
         We're leaning.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.695
       We're just leaning
      against a car, dude.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.299
That's--that's all we're doing.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.367
        Oh, dude, stop--
       stop leaning, man.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.069
 - I thought you said to lean.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.604
           - You have
      a super-creepy lean.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.972
    Just stand. Just stand.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.573
            - Fine.
     - Oh, there's jackson.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.342
        Here, let's go.
            Come on!

  I'm will, marcus' neighbor.

05:15.582 --> 05:16.615

05:16.617 --> 05:18.550
         This is, uh--
         - I'm no one.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.718
        I have no name.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.687
            I mean,
    I'm a cool guy, though.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.988
         I-I have kids.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.423
       I mean, I don't--
        they're my kids.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.325
       I don't <i> have</i> them.

 - Oh, nothing's going on, man.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.428
     We're just wondering,
         are you going

05:29.430 --> 05:31.496
 To marcus' party on Saturday?

05:31.498 --> 05:34.533
  - I was, but mitchell cook's
    party's on the same day.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.001
   - Oh, there's our answer.
     Let's get out of here.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.370
  - No, no, but you're marcus'
      sleepover bro, man.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.538
      Why aren't you going
         to his party?

05:39.540 --> 05:42.074
        - Marcus is cool
        in a weird way,

05:42.076 --> 05:44.743
      But mitchell's party
       is gonna be hype.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.777
     - It's gonna be, uh--

05:45.779 --> 05:47.346
          He say hype?
            - Hype?

05:47.348 --> 05:48.580
      - Swimming pool, dj,

05:48.582 --> 05:49.848
    A grilled-cheese truck.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.516
  - That's, like, no big deal.
          - Standard.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.686
        - A game truck,
  seven giant gaming stations,

05:54.688 --> 05:57.356
        A leather couch,
        laser lights...

05:57.358 --> 05:58.557
        Surround sound.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.359
        - That is dope.

06:00.361 --> 06:02.527
    That's our generation's
       version of "hype."

06:06.366 --> 06:08.567
        - No one outdoes
         a will party.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.135
    This just got personal.

06:13.606 --> 06:13.839
               .

06:13.841 --> 06:15.374
             - Yes!

06:15.376 --> 06:16.575
        Oh, hi, dr. Sam.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.009
    Will said you'd be here,
       and I wanted to be

06:18.011 --> 06:21.680
 You should know that our doors
    are always open to you.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.949
      - Thank you, marcus.
  You're an excellent greeter.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.017
       - So did you save
        any lives today?

06:26.019 --> 06:29.755
        I think you have
     the coolest job ever.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.690
        Did you know one
     of my real-life dreams

06:31.692 --> 06:32.958
  Was to ride in an ambulance?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.526
       - I didn't, but--

06:34.528 --> 06:36.528
- I want to be just hurt enough
       that I get to ride

06:36.530 --> 06:37.863
        In an ambulance,
        but not so hurt

06:37.865 --> 06:39.831
    That I'm not consciously
          aware of it.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.533
    - Yeah, I'm thinking...

06:41.535 --> 06:44.503
  Strained knee or maybe even
       a mild concussion.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.937
      - You are a genius.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.839
           - [laughs]
      - oh, he's not here.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.974
 But I'm expecting him shortly.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.575
            - I see.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.911
- I took your advice and flooded
     my system with gluten.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.746
        - You did what?
           - I, uh...

06:54.748 --> 06:55.981
      I flooded my system
          with gluten.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.783
          Or to put it
       in laymen's terms,

06:57.785 --> 06:59.885
     I had three hot dogs,
     without the dog part.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.787
            Not only
     do I tolerate gluten,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.188
      I frickin' love it.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.589
   My apologies for cussing.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.125
         - No, darling,
   you are gluten intolerant,

07:07.127 --> 07:09.428
   Because you were diagnosed
    by that wonderful shaman

07:09.430 --> 07:11.696
       We met on kibbutz
        in hod hasharon.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.765
- You know, many food allergies
       are misdiagnosed.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.668
         - Yes, by many
     medical professionals.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.603
 - And shaman nonprofessionals.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.905
             - Mm.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.773
             - Oh.
   Uh, I need to talk to you.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.643
  - I've been waiting for you.
- I really need to talk to you.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.611
             - Sam.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.514
      I would love to come
         to the gay-la.

07:29.516 --> 07:30.615
         Gala. Gay-la?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.918
      Does that word trip
        anyone else up?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.085
             - No.
    - I would love to come,

07:34.087 --> 07:35.921
  And I just--I just really--

07:35.923 --> 07:37.989
       I wouldn't miss it
         for the world.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.925
          - Thank you.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.493
   - Let's hold that thought.
          Get in here.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.961
           All right?
           - [laughs]

07:42.963 --> 07:44.896
        - Okay? Take off
  any clothes you want, okay?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.164
     You're coming with me.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.899
         [door closes]

07:49.635 --> 07:51.136
        [coin clatters]

07:51.138 --> 07:52.504
        - A game truck?

07:52.506 --> 07:53.939
     - Not "a" game truck.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.740
       "the" game truck--

07:55.742 --> 07:58.009
     Seven gaming consoles,

07:58.011 --> 07:59.044
        Leather couches,

07:59.046 --> 08:00.645
    Speakers that will make

08:00.647 --> 08:03.148
     Their tiny little ears
        bleed with joy.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.050
  - And this sounds desirable
            to you?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.985
        - Not desirable.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.720
             <i> Hype!</i>

08:08.722 --> 08:11.189
       - It is antisocial
     and promotes violence

08:11.191 --> 08:12.657
       As entertainment.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.928
       What is your idea
       of entertainment?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.997
    And please don't answer
   if it's a terrible answer.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.066
      - What I want to do
          is something

08:21.068 --> 08:24.970
That will bring all the children
        together as one

08:24.972 --> 08:27.038
         And allow them
   to be the creative beings

08:27.040 --> 08:28.907
    That they are naturally,

08:28.909 --> 08:31.977
  And it is making beautiful,

08:31.979 --> 08:34.179
   Nontoxic bubble shapes...

08:34.181 --> 08:35.580
           Together.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.948
        And, of course,
    if some of the children

08:36.950 --> 08:39.583
     Want to whisper a hope
  and a dream into the bubble

08:39.586 --> 08:42.220
     Before they release it
       into the universe,

08:42.222 --> 08:43.554
          Even better.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.890
          - That is...

08:44.892 --> 08:47.559
         So much worse
        than I expected.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.894
            - What?
          - Listen...

08:48.896 --> 08:50.996
   We got to move the party,

08:50.998 --> 08:52.797
  And we got to make it <i> hype!</i>

08:52.799 --> 08:53.798
     - Stop saying "hype."

08:53.800 --> 08:54.966
   I'm not moving the party,

08:54.968 --> 08:57.035
    And I'm not compromising
         the integrity

08:57.037 --> 09:00.005
   Of the party by making it
     a mind-suck on wheels

09:00.007 --> 09:01.606
      Just to lure guests.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.908
      - Okay, that's fine.
          That's fine.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.076
        But please know
      that when the party

09:05.078 --> 09:07.145
     Is me, you, and marcus
         sitting around

09:07.147 --> 09:08.980
      Blowing hope bubbles
        into the world,

09:08.982 --> 09:12.817
     My hope will be to be
     at mitchell's party...

09:12.819 --> 09:16.254
            Or dead.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.823
        - I got to say,
 it's pretty impressive, will.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.059
     You do the right thing
          by dr. Sam.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.228
  Then you do the right thing
           with fiona

09:23.230 --> 09:25.196
       By convincing her
       to move the party.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.098
       Pretty good stuff.
     - I still have to find

09:27.100 --> 09:29.167
 Something hype to draw people
       to marcus' party.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.169
            I mean,
     anything remotely hype

09:31.171 --> 09:32.637
       Is already booked.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.606
    - I got something hype.
       - What do you got?

09:34.608 --> 09:35.941
     - You know what I got.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.108
           - Oh, no.
           Andy, no.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.243
           Don't e--

09:38.245 --> 09:40.612
        Andy, I beg you,
     please don't do this!

09:40.614 --> 09:42.948
         Andy! Stop it!

09:42.950 --> 09:44.049
         Andy, stop it!

09:45.952 --> 09:48.153
 - Andini, master of illusion!

09:48.155 --> 09:49.688
      - We retired andini.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.823
             - Ooh.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.959
              Oh.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.026
     - Definitely not hype.

09:57.697 --> 09:58.997
     - No, listen, sanjeev,

09:58.999 --> 10:00.265
      I don't mind paying
           a bit more

10:00.267 --> 10:02.100
   For nontoxic bubble soap,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.302
          But, I mean,
  it's got to work, hasn't it?

10:04.304 --> 10:05.971
Look at that. I mean, you can't
    see what I'm looking at,

10:05.973 --> 10:07.138
    But there's no bubbles.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.908
     It's just costly soap,
           isn't it?

10:09.910 --> 10:12.978
         - How high can
     the hot-air balloon be

10:12.980 --> 10:14.379
        Over the house,
      and how many people

10:14.381 --> 10:16.014
        Can bungee jump
        at the same time

10:16.016 --> 10:17.949
        Without slamming
        into each other?

10:17.951 --> 10:18.984
         - [stammering]

10:18.986 --> 10:20.218
     That's not happening!

10:20.220 --> 10:21.886
           - Let me--
     let me call you back.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.989
         Okay, we are--
    we are totally screwed.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.891
 I mean, every cool party thing
        has been booked

10:26.893 --> 10:27.993
       Months in advance.

10:27.995 --> 10:32.397
      I sent out an e-vite
  with the new date and time,

10:32.399 --> 10:35.333
 And two people already rsvp'd
      in the affirmative.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.003
      Marcus barely knows
          one of them.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.071
  They're not his top choices,
           but still,

10:40.073 --> 10:41.973
  They are warm bodies coming
   to celebrate his birthday

10:41.975 --> 10:44.275
         - There we go.
     We can build on that.

10:44.277 --> 10:48.013
            - Okay.
         - Okay, cool.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.981
  What--you said you moved it
      to Sunday afternoon?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.116
    That's when you did it?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.217
      - Yeah, that's what
           we agreed.

10:52.219 --> 10:56.087
- Yeah, I was just making sure.
             Great.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.992
   Same time as sam's gay-la.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.962
            Gah-la.
            [sighs]

11:06.866 --> 11:07.098
               .

11:07.100 --> 11:10.802
     I got to go take care
      of the cupcake truck

11:10.804 --> 11:12.237
       For another party.
   - Okay, sweet, thank you.

11:12.239 --> 11:16.408
   - You said we were meeting
 with a holistic party planner.

11:16.410 --> 11:17.809
      What's he gonna do--

11:17.811 --> 11:19.678
  Reiki, while you jack a car

11:19.680 --> 11:20.679
      On <i> grand theft auto?</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:21.913
          I'm leaving.
          - Listen...

11:21.915 --> 11:23.982
   I know you hate everything
       about this truck.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.283
    But marcus will love it.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.018
   All his friends will too.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.854
    So, if you say no to it,
    the calamity is on you.

11:29.856 --> 11:34.192
      [video game sounds]
     [whispers] oh, my god.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.760
           All right.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.395
      - Now we're talking.
          Here we go.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.030
       Where is this guy?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.231
        - Any questions?
           - Oh, hey.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.766
  Uh, no questions whatsoever.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.001
          We want it.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.103
     We will take it Sunday
     at 1:00 p.M., please.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.771
       - You kidding me?
    - No, we're not kidding.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.007
        We're serious as
  a chelsea/arsenal shootout.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.775
    - Well, we're booked up
        all day Sunday.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.143
 - Well, how much do you charge
            an hour?

11:52.145 --> 11:53.745
     - $350 for two hours.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.880
       - The balls on you
      to charge that much!

11:55.882 --> 11:58.083
      - I'll give you $500
         for two hours.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.984
         - It's booked.
    - $1,000 for two hours.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.253
             - Oh.
- I hear myself saying "booked."

12:02.255 --> 12:03.455
       Do you not hear me
        saying "booked"?

12:03.457 --> 12:06.758
     - I hear myself saying
      $2,000 for one hour.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.460
         - Will. Get--
    excuse us for a second.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.994
            Come o--
        just come here.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.830
           - $2,500.
           - Stop it!

12:11.832 --> 12:12.997
        Are you insane?

12:12.999 --> 12:13.998
     - I screwed up, okay?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.934
        I can't even go
         to this party.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.102
 - What are you talking about?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.838
        - Sam invited me
    to this event on Sunday,

12:19.840 --> 12:21.072
     And I told her I'd go.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.340
You know, it's really important
           to her...

12:22.342 --> 12:24.743
         - Oh, my god.
   - And she wants me there.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.077
      And I thought, like,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.312
      If at marcus' party,
      there's just, like,

12:27.314 --> 12:29.013
        A few stragglers
       and I'm not there,

12:29.015 --> 12:30.381
  He's gonna be super bummed,
         but if there's

12:30.383 --> 12:33.918
    This awesome game truck
   packed with his buddies--

12:33.920 --> 12:35.220
           You know?
          - All right.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.888
      - I'll just tell sam
          I won't go.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.256
      I-I'll just tell her
          I won't go.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.824
        - No, will, no.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.226
      You're trying to do
     a nice thing, I know.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.027
         But you've got
      a commitment to sam.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.429
   You've got to honor that.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.131
      Now we've got to get
       this truck, right?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.799
       Now we have to get
           the truck.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.100
     - All right, I'm gonna
        go talk to him.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.435
   - No, 'cause your money's
            no good.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.003
            Just...

12:52.005 --> 12:53.505
          Let me try.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.510
             Hello.

12:58.512 --> 13:01.446
   I just wanted to apologize
      for my crass friend

13:01.448 --> 13:04.149
        Trying to bribe
        your patronage.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.217
         - That's okay.
       I've seen it all.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.853
          - Have you?
        I bet you have.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.022
     I was just wondering,
     because I really need

13:11.024 --> 13:14.025
      To rent your mobile
     gaming establishment,

13:14.027 --> 13:16.828
     If there was anything
      that I could say...

13:16.830 --> 13:18.296
            Or do...

13:18.298 --> 13:22.000
 To make you change your mind.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.968
        - I'm listening.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.538
 - Uh, maybe you could perform
           some sort

13:26.540 --> 13:30.008
   Of scheduling switcheroo,

13:30.010 --> 13:31.843
      And if you did that,

13:31.845 --> 13:36.014
       You would make me
       a very grateful...

13:36.016 --> 13:37.048
             Woman.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.449
           - Really?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.551
         How grateful?

13:39.553 --> 13:43.221
  - The most grateful woman...

13:45.124 --> 13:46.991
    Short of actually having
           to perform

13:46.993 --> 13:49.227
   Any sort of sex with you.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.361
        Would that work?

13:50.363 --> 13:51.863
  - I'd like to help you out,

13:51.865 --> 13:53.464
          But Sunday's
     my nephew's birthday.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.133
   I mean, I don't especially
         like the kid,

13:55.135 --> 13:56.401
     But I got to give him
           the truck.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.136
- Well, then what'd you make me
        do all that for?

13:58.138 --> 14:00.171
 - I don't know--I was kind of
  enjoying all the attention.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.873
      You're kind of hot.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.007
         - Bloody hell.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.609
 - Want to get a beer sometime?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.878
     Ride the wiener truck?
             - No.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.618
        Perfect birthday
         for my marcus.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.958
   - Listen, I don't want you
      to get all concerned

14:19.960 --> 14:21.926
     About what's going on
       over there, okay?

14:21.928 --> 14:25.563
           Your party
     is going to be great.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.598
             Okay?

14:26.600 --> 14:28.633
     We got you a magician

14:28.635 --> 14:31.002
   Who's super...Interesting,

14:31.004 --> 14:34.439
      And we got your mom
 to acknowledge medical facts,

14:34.441 --> 14:37.242
   And you're gonna be eating
 a cake that has gluten in it.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.977
    No sugar, but, you know,

14:38.979 --> 14:40.545
          I hear agave
        is pretty good.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.147
  And then, you know, you got
  four confirmed party guests

14:43.149 --> 14:47.018
       Of varying degrees
         of popularity,

14:47.020 --> 14:48.353
         And, you know,
   I know that doesn't sound

14:48.355 --> 14:50.021
   Like a-a big number, but--

14:50.023 --> 14:51.556
       - Are you kidding?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.958
That's the best number I've had
 since my party at the kibbutz.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.427
 And those people were required
     by the torah to come.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.030
        And truthfully,
       I really only care

14:59.032 --> 15:00.665
      That my best friend
         will be there.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.000
    In case it's unclear...

15:02.002 --> 15:03.534
           [chuckles]
     I'm referring to you.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.674
- Listen, marcus, I got to talk
    to you about something.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.644
     I'm not gonna be able
      to be at your party.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.279
     - You're--you're not?

15:14.281 --> 15:17.515
        - No, I really,
 really want to be there, man,

15:17.517 --> 15:21.185
    But, see, sam invited me
         to this gala,

15:21.187 --> 15:24.522
    And she's really special
           to me too,

15:24.524 --> 15:27.692
       And so I told her
         I'd be there.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.228
      You know, you and I
  will celebrate another time,

15:30.230 --> 15:33.031
    And it'll be like having
         two birthdays.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.034
    Oh, and in the meantime,
 I got you a pretty crazy gift

15:36.036 --> 15:38.036
   That I think is gonna make
        your mom freak.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.437
  Do you want to open it now?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.306
        - Thanks, will.
             I'll--

15:41.308 --> 15:44.342
    I'm gonna open it later.

15:49.214 --> 15:52.283
             - Ugh.

15:53.419 --> 15:57.021
   - Better than the kibbutz.

16:00.359 --> 16:00.591
               .

16:00.593 --> 16:03.194
    - Whoa, this is insane.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.396
          And you look
    ridiculously beautiful.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.332
         I thought you
     were gonna wear scrubs

16:07.334 --> 16:10.034
    With some nice earrings,
     maybe a little rouge.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.470
   - Okay, no woman has said
      "rouge" since 1954.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.272
          - [chuckles]
        - but thank you.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.040
             Hey...

16:16.042 --> 16:17.275
        I'm really glad
       that you're here.

16:17.277 --> 16:21.079
      - Hey, not with all
     these people watching.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.180
       - Oh, I don't care
          who sees us.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.515
          - [laughing]
        my boss is here.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.351
           - Dr. Sam.
             - Ah.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.652
              Hi.
           - Well...

16:27.654 --> 16:30.388
    Look who finally brought
    a plus-one to the party.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.290
       - Yeah, that's not
        a big deal, bev.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.591
    - Oh, it's a huge deal.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.626
 Everybody's checking you out,
         but, you know,

16:35.628 --> 16:37.762
        I'm the only one
     who'll say something.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.564
   You're looking good, will.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.499
     - Oh, thank you, bev.
          So are you.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.002
          - Thank you.
    And we will be dancing.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.070
     - Oh, as long as it's
     a slow dance, I'm in.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.638
             - Oh.
       Be still my heart.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.140
          [both laugh]

16:49.142 --> 16:51.342
         - Let's go in.
            Come on.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.744
     Hi. Dr. Samantha lake.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.713
    [classical piano music]

16:55.715 --> 17:01.019
              ¶ ¶

17:01.021 --> 17:03.254
      What are you doing?

17:03.256 --> 17:04.689
       - I can't be here.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.089
      - What do you mean?

17:06.092 --> 17:08.459
         - I got to go
   to marcus' birthday party.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.528
       - But we're here.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.296
        I told everyone
        you were coming.

17:12.298 --> 17:15.165
            My boss
      is right over there.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.634
       - I know, I know,

17:16.636 --> 17:18.269
      And I know how much
       this means to you,

17:18.271 --> 17:22.440
         But his party
   is a total disaster, sam,

17:22.442 --> 17:24.275
    And it is all my fault.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.778
        - Will, you know
        I like marcus...

17:26.780 --> 17:28.112
             A lot.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.481
      And I love that you
       do things for him.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.484
    But you always leave me
         to go do them.

17:33.486 --> 17:37.255
   Which is great for marcus,
    and it's great for you,

17:37.257 --> 17:39.190
           But it's--
   it's not so great for me.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.826
  I-I don't want to be the one
   that's always left alone.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.127
      - You're 100% right.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.328
        I don't want you
      to be alone either.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.130
        I never want you
          to be alone.

17:46.132 --> 17:50.368
   But this little guy, like,
     really needs me today,

17:50.370 --> 17:52.203
 And I got to be there for him.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.338
         I'm so sorry.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.542
        I-I am so sorry.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.611
  I just hope you understand.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.288
          - Ha ha ha!

18:10.290 --> 18:11.823
        Please observe.

18:11.825 --> 18:15.259
     There wasn't a flower.
     Now there's a flower!

18:15.261 --> 18:16.561
            Nothing?

18:16.563 --> 18:17.795
        All right, okay.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.363
   - You know, I didn't fall
       in love with andy.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.731
         I saw andini,
      master of illusion,

18:20.733 --> 18:22.133
          Doing magic
        down by pier 39,

18:22.135 --> 18:25.269
         And I thought,
      "that man needs me."

18:25.271 --> 18:26.504
      And look at him now.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.172
       He's a better man
         because of me.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.441
    - Still not the greatest
      illusionist, though.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.643
      - Tell me about it.
      It's hard to watch.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.480
          - Is this--
       is this your card?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.148
          - No, andy.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.616
         - It's andini,
      master of illusion.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.685
   If you could call me that,
        that'd be great.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.588
       Is that your card?
          - No, andy.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.289
      - This is your card.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.290
             - No.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.558
      - This is your card!

18:47.560 --> 18:49.260
        - No, it's not.
       - It is your card!

18:49.262 --> 18:51.295
          Okay? It is!
      - Is this your card?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.131
      - Will, you're here!

18:53.133 --> 18:54.265
      The party is saved!

18:54.267 --> 18:56.300
            - Great.
     Two crappy magicians.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.301
            - What?
          - Let's go.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.570
  - Worst party ever, marcus.
             - Uh--

18:59.572 --> 19:02.273
            - Yeah.
     - And so it continues.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.208
     - Okay, hold on, kids.
       I'm in charge now.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.310
       Back to the table
           right now.

19:06.312 --> 19:10.181
    Who wants to see me pull
   a rabbit out of this hat?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.415
   - You're not gonna do it.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.783
     In the name of magic,

19:12.785 --> 19:14.152
        I got to ask you
      to cease and desist.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.219
       This is my trick.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.487
         - Abracadabra,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.289
          Hocus pocus.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.724
      - No, don't do that!

19:23.530 --> 19:25.263
          Get it off!
          Get it off!

19:25.265 --> 19:26.397
              Aah!

19:26.399 --> 19:29.634
         - The rabbit!
     - Where's the rabbit?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.302
         [siren blips]

19:31.304 --> 19:33.771
         - Bloody hell,
      that's good service.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.406
         - Where did--
     where'd the rabbit go?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.341
     - A serious emergency
      has been reported--

19:37.343 --> 19:39.677
    Some kids not having fun
      at a birthday party?

19:39.679 --> 19:42.313
      - A real ambulance?
         - Yes, it is.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.748
        And hey, marcus,
          if you want,

19:43.750 --> 19:44.949
    We can take your friends
           on a ride.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.918
     - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
      - Take the ride now!

19:46.920 --> 19:48.219
         - Let's ride!
            - Yeah!

19:48.221 --> 19:49.587
             - Yes!
     - Let's go, let's go!

19:49.589 --> 19:50.955
          - Whoo-hoo!

19:50.957 --> 19:55.326
       - You have no idea
       how happy I am...

19:55.328 --> 19:56.227
           [laughing]
          to see you.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.862
  - Come on, will, let's ride!

19:59.464 --> 20:00.565
             - Oh!
             - Eew!

20:00.567 --> 20:01.766
        - That's nasty.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.602
          - Dr. Lake,
         call came in.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.970
    Your boyfriend's rabbit
          made its way

20:05.972 --> 20:07.972
      Over to elm street,
    caused a fender bender.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.840
      - Hey, birthday boy.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.442
        Flip the siren.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.443
         [siren wails]

20:12.445 --> 20:13.778
        [boys cheering]

20:13.780 --> 20:15.346
            - Yeah!
            - Whoa!

20:15.348 --> 20:17.848
  - [imitating siren wailing]

20:17.850 --> 20:19.951
    I got to ring the siren,

20:19.953 --> 20:22.720
      And sam let me hold
      the e.K.G. Paddles.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.555
   We wanted to shock andini,
             but...

20:24.557 --> 20:25.957
           [chuckles]
   we couldn't keep him down.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.592
    - Don't worry, darling.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.859
           You know,
     he lives with laurie,

20:28.861 --> 20:31.329
 So there's no shortage of pain
          in his life.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.530
    - It's time to open it.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.899
      - [laughs] oh, will,
    I don't need a present.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.968
I already had the best birthday
          of my life.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.970
        - Just open it.

20:38.972 --> 20:42.840
       - Is this outside
the store-bought-present policy?

20:42.842 --> 20:44.976
             - Oh.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.344
           A hammer.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.312
              Wow.
           Just, uh,

20:48.314 --> 20:49.480
        Just--just wow.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.748
     - There's more to it.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.916
    - I was kind of hoping.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.284
          - Come here.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.418
            - Sweet.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.355
       I've always wanted
      my own pile of wood.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.257
 - It's not just a random pile
        of wood, marcus.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.359
 Together, with some other wood
     and maybe some tools,

21:01.361 --> 21:03.361
       We are gonna build
         a tree house!

21:03.363 --> 21:06.030
   - Good luck topping this,
    future birthday parties.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.898
   - Do you have any idea how
to actually build a tree house?

21:07.900 --> 21:11.969
     Of course he doesn't,
but we're gonna build it anyway.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.805
         - Sounds hype.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.440
     - Does it still count
       as a homemade gift

21:16.442 --> 21:18.276
     If I pay someone else
           to do it?

21:18.278 --> 21:20.044
             - No.
      - I didn't think so.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.814
   [inhales, exhales slowly]

21:23.816 --> 21:25.816
          [dog barks]
