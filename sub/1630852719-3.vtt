00:56.620 --> 00:59.740
This is the boreal forest...

01:04.820 --> 01:07.380
..the largest forest on Earth.

01:09.100 --> 01:12.740
750 billion trees...

01:15.500 --> 01:18.860
..smothered by snow throughout
the winter.

01:23.940 --> 01:28.780
This is the northernmost boundary
of an extraordinary world.

01:32.500 --> 01:37.140
I'm standing at the edge
of the Arctic Circle.

01:37.140 --> 01:41.700
To the north of me lies a land
dominated for most of the year

01:41.700 --> 01:43.860
by snow and ice.

01:43.860 --> 01:47.620
3,000 miles to the south -
the tropics,

01:47.620 --> 01:51.660
bathed the year round
in warm sunshine.

01:51.660 --> 01:55.300
And in between,
a very different world,

01:55.300 --> 01:58.780
dominated by relentless change.

02:04.660 --> 02:08.660
An endless cycle
of four distinct seasons,

02:08.660 --> 02:11.020
each with its own challenges.

02:12.620 --> 02:15.260
The short, freezing days of winter

02:15.260 --> 02:19.220
give way to the urgent awakening
of spring.

02:22.060 --> 02:25.620
And the long, hot days of summer

02:25.620 --> 02:28.780
yield to the cooling of autumn.

02:33.340 --> 02:36.180
Opportunities will be brief.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.700
To survive these extremes,

02:45.700 --> 02:49.940
plants have not only got to be
hardy and resilient,

02:49.940 --> 02:53.420
but many of them have developed
special strategies

02:53.420 --> 02:57.740
in order to meet the demands
of this seasonal world.

02:59.900 --> 03:04.180
To succeed, they must get
their timing just right.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.860
For months now,
this world has been asleep.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.460
But change is coming.

03:29.820 --> 03:32.740
Spring is on its way.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.980
In Canada, the forests are
starting to stir.

04:02.180 --> 04:05.620
Throughout the winter,
the sugar maples here

04:05.620 --> 04:09.980
have kept stores of nutrients
ready for this moment.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.100
Now, as temperatures start to rise,

04:16.100 --> 04:19.660
those nutrients must be brought
up from the roots.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.660
Sap is on the rise.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.980
Fuel for new green growth.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.780
But just as growth reaches
full speed...

04:53.340 --> 04:55.380
..robbers arrive.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.860
A sap sucker.

05:17.860 --> 05:22.140
A thief in search of maple syrup.

05:39.820 --> 05:42.780
The tree can tolerate
hundreds of wounds.

05:50.140 --> 05:53.940
But if they completely encircle
the trunk,

05:53.940 --> 05:57.180
the tree will eventually die.

06:04.420 --> 06:08.300
The sap sucker's break-in
hasn't gone unnoticed.

06:17.420 --> 06:23.820
Hummingbirds, squirrels and insects

06:23.820 --> 06:27.140
all invade the sap sucker's
territory,

06:27.140 --> 06:29.180
trying to steal a meal.

06:33.380 --> 06:36.380
But unwittingly, they help the tree.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.860
Time spent chasing the
competition...

06:46.580 --> 06:49.940
..means less time to drill
new holes.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.580
The tree gets a chance to repair
its wounds.

07:25.780 --> 07:28.700
And the sap can rise freely again.

07:36.060 --> 07:41.180
So this year, at least, the tree
will once more produce its leaves.

07:45.780 --> 07:48.500
Hundreds of miniature solar panels

07:48.500 --> 07:50.860
that collect energy from
the sunlight.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.700
Each leaf is covered by millions
of microscopic pores.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.700
Stomata.

08:04.460 --> 08:07.340
They take in carbon dioxide...

08:08.980 --> 08:11.900
..and release oxygen and
water vapour

08:11.900 --> 08:15.580
in a process that produces
high-energy fuel.

08:27.980 --> 08:31.060
All the trees here can now use
that fuel

08:31.060 --> 08:33.500
to grow over the coming months.

08:52.780 --> 08:57.860
As spring proceeds,
the power of the sun increases.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.740
On river banks across Europe,

09:03.740 --> 09:09.140
many plants have been lying dormant
underground,

09:09.140 --> 09:11.820
waiting for the earth to warm.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.900
And now a race begins.

09:28.140 --> 09:32.980
Among the first to start
are nettles - the sprinters.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.580
Then, only just behind,
come the brambles.

09:43.900 --> 09:47.500
They're much more aggressive
and have backward-pointed hooks

09:47.500 --> 09:50.460
with which to scramble
over their rivals.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.260
Last to come - the climbers.

09:59.540 --> 10:01.860
Hops...

10:01.860 --> 10:03.900
..and bryony.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.580
They lasso their way
towards the light.

10:39.700 --> 10:44.540
Soon, every inch of space and every
patch of light has been claimed.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.820
But hidden in the shadows,

10:49.820 --> 10:53.700
another plant has been waiting
to make its move.

11:03.180 --> 11:06.260
This...

11:06.260 --> 11:08.300
..is dodder.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.500
A hunter...

11:18.140 --> 11:20.660
..with an exceptional
sense of smell.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.300
Moving swiftly, it searches
for its prey.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.500
It detects the scent of
a young nettle.

11:56.780 --> 12:00.260
The dodder punctures the nettle's
stem

12:00.260 --> 12:02.780
and sucks out the nutritious sap.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.460
And it doesn't stop at just
one victim.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.460
With its energy supply assured,

12:15.460 --> 12:17.500
it multiplies.

12:26.420 --> 12:30.100
It's a parasite with an insatiable
appetite.

13:32.300 --> 13:37.940
But remarkably, its victims can now
exploit the dodder...

13:40.020 --> 13:42.820
..when other springtime enemies
appear.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.860
Caterpillars.

14:00.060 --> 14:03.700
When under attack, a leaf sends out
a signal

14:03.700 --> 14:07.460
telling the rest of the plant
to start building defences...

14:10.380 --> 14:14.340
..foul-tasting toxins that deter
the caterpillars.

14:17.380 --> 14:19.780
In an extraordinary twist,

14:19.780 --> 14:23.060
the stems of the dodder
interconnecting the plants

14:23.060 --> 14:26.780
are now being used as
lines of communication

14:26.780 --> 14:31.340
to relay these warning signals
from plant to plant.

14:37.780 --> 14:41.940
They respond by producing
their own protective chemicals.

14:45.940 --> 14:51.220
Eventually, the whole river bank
becomes one huge defensive network.

14:52.740 --> 14:56.700
And the one-time rivals
are now better off together.

15:18.300 --> 15:23.780
The first warm days of spring
encourage some plants to flower

15:23.780 --> 15:26.180
and get ahead of the competition...

15:27.740 --> 15:32.380
..creating beautiful displays
throughout the seasonal world.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.380
From the spectacular
cherry blossoms of Japan...

15:41.620 --> 15:45.460
..to the goldfield flowers
of California.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.420
But spring flowering is risky.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.260
If they flower too early, it may not
be warm enough

15:55.260 --> 15:57.700
for pollinating insects
to be active.

15:59.620 --> 16:03.740
But the common daisy gives
them every opportunity.

16:07.580 --> 16:11.500
The warmer the flowers are,
the more attractive they are -

16:11.500 --> 16:15.980
and they have a remarkable strategy
in order to maximise this.

16:17.900 --> 16:21.460
They were closed up tightly
throughout the night

16:21.460 --> 16:23.820
as a protection against the
elements.

16:23.820 --> 16:27.500
But once they feel the warmth and
the light of the sun,

16:27.500 --> 16:29.540
they spring into action.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.700
It's a behaviour called
heliotropism.

16:48.660 --> 16:52.580
They turn to keep facing the sun,

16:52.580 --> 16:55.340
absorbing as much heat as they can.

17:12.100 --> 17:15.620
This is a thermal camera,

17:15.620 --> 17:21.060
and it will tell me the difference
between the surrounding temperature

17:21.060 --> 17:25.180
and the temperature in the centre
of a daisy flower.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.500
The surroundings - 12 degrees.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.300
In the centre of a flower...

17:38.100 --> 17:43.620
Pollinators such as bees and wasps
prefer the warmed-up flowers

17:43.620 --> 17:46.540
because they can get a share
of the heat for themselves.

17:48.420 --> 17:52.580
As a consequence, they can collect
more nectar from more flowers,

17:52.580 --> 17:54.620
pollinating as they go.

17:57.580 --> 18:00.940
And the daisies, with the help
of their pollinators,

18:00.940 --> 18:04.260
are able to have a particularly
long flowering season.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.660
But when the window of opportunity
is brief,

18:10.660 --> 18:13.340
even more ingenious tactics
are necessary.

18:26.820 --> 18:29.340
Here in south-western Australia,

18:29.340 --> 18:33.380
summer temperatures can soar
to up to 40 degrees Celsius.

18:44.140 --> 18:47.340
Now, for a brief moment
in the cooler spring,

18:47.340 --> 18:49.540
flowering plants must get busy.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.540
And this hammer orchid,
with its strange flower,

18:58.540 --> 19:00.580
is doing exactly that.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.660
It needs to attract a pollinator,

19:06.660 --> 19:10.100
but has no nectar and doesn't even
look like a flower.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.660
Unlike these neighbouring
huge grass trees.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.780
These produce thousands
of tiny white flowers,

19:24.780 --> 19:26.820
all dripping with nectar.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.140
But the orchid has a different
strategy.

19:39.460 --> 19:45.060
It synchronises its emergence
with the brief mating season

19:45.060 --> 19:47.540
of the thynnid wasp.

19:53.020 --> 19:58.940
The flightless female wasp produces
pheromones to attract males.

20:07.340 --> 20:11.100
This male detects a scent
that seems to be hers...

20:19.180 --> 20:21.860
..yet flies right on by.

20:28.300 --> 20:33.140
The orchid not only has the same
shape and colour as a female wasp,

20:33.140 --> 20:35.820
but it sits at the same height
as she does.

20:37.780 --> 20:39.820
It even mimics her smell.

20:42.060 --> 20:46.380
And the beguiled male attempts
to mate with it.

21:02.340 --> 21:05.660
He hammers against the orchid's
pollen sacks.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.700
And the wasp leaves,
doubtless a little shaken...

21:17.780 --> 21:19.940
..only to be duped once again.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.940
The pollen on his back now sticks
to this different orchid.

21:35.580 --> 21:38.100
And the deception has worked.

21:41.500 --> 21:46.940
The orchid's imitation is even
more intoxicating, it seems,

21:46.940 --> 21:48.980
than the real thing.

22:09.380 --> 22:13.860
Eventually, the male wasps tire
of the orchid's enticements.

22:17.900 --> 22:21.540
And now, the wasps,
both male and female,

22:21.540 --> 22:24.700
find the flowers of the grass trees
to feed.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.980
And there, at long last...

22:31.340 --> 22:33.380
..they mate.

22:39.380 --> 22:41.420
And as for the hammer orchid?

22:43.180 --> 22:45.380
Pollination is complete.

22:58.220 --> 23:03.620
As summer approaches, the need to
flower becomes more urgent.

23:05.140 --> 23:11.340
And nowhere more so than here
in South Africa.

23:15.180 --> 23:19.900
This is the fynbos,
part of the Cape floral kingdom,

23:19.900 --> 23:24.220
a great expanse of open heathlands
just north of the cape.

23:27.620 --> 23:30.460
Here there are more different
species of plant

23:30.460 --> 23:32.500
than anywhere else in the world.

23:34.060 --> 23:37.820
Nearly 9,000,
many needing pollinators.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.020
They compete with one another
for such help

23:45.020 --> 23:49.820
by flaunting extravagant shapes
and vivid colours.

23:51.780 --> 23:55.620
All promising nectar as a
sugary reward.

23:59.620 --> 24:04.180
But there is a plant here that
avoids this crowded competition.

24:06.700 --> 24:11.500
And the rising temperatures
of summer bring just what it needs.

24:35.700 --> 24:39.340
This is the first fire here
for 15 years.

24:49.620 --> 24:52.220
Nearly all the plants are destroyed.

24:57.660 --> 24:59.700
Incinerated.

25:08.460 --> 25:12.020
It might seem from the smoke
and the still-smouldering embers

25:12.020 --> 25:15.180
that no plant could survive
such an inferno.

25:25.740 --> 25:28.820
But just four days after
the flames...

25:30.540 --> 25:32.580
..rising from the ashes...

25:37.900 --> 25:39.940
..a fire lily.

25:47.340 --> 25:52.140
It has been lying dormant
underground for 15 years,

25:52.140 --> 25:56.780
but now, awakened by the smoke,
it flowers.

26:06.900 --> 26:11.820
The blooms may be small and unshowy,
but that's all they need to be.

26:15.020 --> 26:19.420
In this charred landscape,
pollinators, such as these sunbirds,

26:19.420 --> 26:23.380
can spot these little red beacons
from great distances.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.420
They're the only source of nectar
around.

26:42.340 --> 26:44.780
And the more visitors the flowers
attract,

26:44.780 --> 26:47.580
the more likely they are to be
pollinated.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.340
It's just in time.

27:08.780 --> 27:14.420
Within a few months, the whole
landscape is alive once more.

27:17.980 --> 27:22.100
In fact, all these plants need fire
to survive.

27:27.380 --> 27:31.180
And as competitors return,

27:31.180 --> 27:33.220
the fire lily fades.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.060
It now returns underground

27:44.060 --> 27:49.100
and will rest there as a bulb
until another fire awakens it.

27:59.500 --> 28:03.740
By the time the long, hot days
of summer arrive,

28:03.740 --> 28:07.900
wild flower meadows are bursting
with life.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.660
But autumn is not far away.

28:14.540 --> 28:19.140
So now pollinated plants must
use their remaining energy

28:19.140 --> 28:21.660
to produce the next generation.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.780
Seeds.

28:33.620 --> 28:37.900
A dandelion clock
contains around 200 seeds...

28:42.980 --> 28:45.380
..each with its own tiny parachute.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.220
Few seeds can fly as far as these.

28:54.220 --> 28:57.860
Some are known to have travelled
over 60 miles.

29:05.300 --> 29:10.380
But to travel any distance at all,
they need the wind to be just right.

29:16.700 --> 29:20.340
However, before they can get away,
there is a risk.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.540
Voracious hunters live in
this meadow.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.620
Tiny harvest mice.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.900
They love dandelion seeds.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.980
But they don't like to share.

30:16.260 --> 30:20.380
Finally, the sun warms the ground

30:20.380 --> 30:23.380
and a gentle breeze blows in,

30:23.380 --> 30:26.180
creating an ideal updraught.

30:39.660 --> 30:43.260
Air flowing between the bristles
creates a vortex

30:43.260 --> 30:45.300
that lifts the seeds up.

30:49.820 --> 30:55.940
Heading off on a gentle breeze,
this seed now starts its travels.

31:24.100 --> 31:27.220
Plants use a variety of different
techniques

31:27.220 --> 31:31.180
to spread their seeds as far as
possible from themselves.

31:31.180 --> 31:34.300
And one of the most remarkable
is this one.

31:34.300 --> 31:39.060
It's called ecballium,
and it's a relative of the cucumber.

31:39.060 --> 31:43.580
For several weeks now, pressure has
been building up inside the pods.

31:43.580 --> 31:48.340
Until now, they're as taut as a
well-pumped-up bicycle tyre.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.620
All they need is just a slight
nudge.

32:09.460 --> 32:14.220
The further the plant can fire
its seeds, the better.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.180
If a seedling germinates close to
its parent,

32:19.180 --> 32:22.940
the two will have to compete for
nutrients and light.

32:26.380 --> 32:32.020
This Himalayan balsam has seed pods
that react rather differently,

32:32.020 --> 32:34.140
like catapults.

32:34.140 --> 32:38.340
As they dry out, they begin to
strain along precisely positioned

32:38.340 --> 32:40.380
lines of weakness.

32:40.380 --> 32:42.940
And then, just the slightest
disturbance,

32:42.940 --> 32:47.140
even a single raindrop, is enough
to trigger the mechanism.

33:20.420 --> 33:23.140
The east coast of South Africa.

33:26.100 --> 33:29.060
Summer here brings scorching
temperatures.

33:38.860 --> 33:42.300
This Ceratocaryum has to get
its seeds underground

33:42.300 --> 33:44.340
before it gets too hot.

33:46.700 --> 33:49.980
And it has acquired somewhat
unlikely allies.

33:56.420 --> 33:58.460
Dung beetles.

34:01.580 --> 34:06.540
They have a particular fondness
for antelope droppings.

34:10.460 --> 34:13.860
At this time of the year,
these beetles bury the dung

34:13.860 --> 34:15.900
and lay their eggs on it.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.460
And the fresher...

34:26.700 --> 34:28.740
..the better.

34:33.620 --> 34:39.460
Ceratocaryum's spindly stems
send their seeds flying.

35:01.260 --> 35:04.620
They're the same size, shape

35:04.620 --> 35:07.780
and even smell remarkably like...

35:09.100 --> 35:11.140
..antelope dung.

35:24.620 --> 35:28.060
The beetles simply can't
resist them.

35:46.940 --> 35:51.220
Dung beetles always bury
dung balls at the same depth.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.380
And it's one which suits the seeds
very well.

36:04.140 --> 36:07.020
So effective is the seed's deception

36:07.020 --> 36:10.980
that the beetles come back for more
time and time again.

36:26.700 --> 36:31.260
Most of the Ceratocaryum seeds
get safely buried...

36:34.700 --> 36:38.140
..exactly where they need to be.

36:57.580 --> 37:03.020
As the sun begins to retreat,
so autumn arrives.

37:06.260 --> 37:11.540
The cooler, shorter days are the cue
for many seasonal forests

37:11.540 --> 37:14.180
to prepare for the winter shutdown.

37:17.740 --> 37:22.340
The trees start to divert their
nutrients back into their roots.

37:24.100 --> 37:27.220
And there, other organisms
await them.

37:34.700 --> 37:36.740
Fungi.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.980
Mushrooms are the familiar face
of fungi,

38:19.980 --> 38:22.620
but they are merely the fruiting
bodies.

38:22.620 --> 38:26.060
Some of them only last
for a few days.

38:26.060 --> 38:30.100
They are, however, evidence
of the giant organism

38:30.100 --> 38:32.660
that lies in the soil beneath.

38:32.660 --> 38:37.940
Just a single handful of soil may
contain several thousand metres

38:37.940 --> 38:41.140
of their microscopic filaments.

38:41.140 --> 38:46.300
It's only recently that we have
discovered the extraordinary role

38:46.300 --> 38:49.860
that these fungi play in a forest
like this.

38:52.900 --> 38:58.420
Their filaments plug into the tips
of the tree's roots

38:58.420 --> 39:03.260
and nutrients pass between tree
and fungus throughout the year.

39:05.340 --> 39:10.260
Some fungi have the ability to link
with not just a single tree,

39:10.260 --> 39:13.340
but with a whole group of trees,

39:13.340 --> 39:16.740
so that the entire forest may be
linked together

39:16.740 --> 39:19.020
by these microscopic threads,

39:19.020 --> 39:22.500
to form what you might call
a wood-wide web.

39:31.020 --> 39:34.940
Hundreds of trees can be
interconnected by these webs.

39:36.020 --> 39:39.580
Scientists call it
the mycorrhizal network.

39:41.540 --> 39:44.020
And it might look something
like this.

39:52.980 --> 39:56.460
They've discovered that trees
not only send nutrients along it

39:56.460 --> 40:00.100
but chemical and electrical signals,

40:00.100 --> 40:02.980
allowing them to communicate
with one another.

40:05.060 --> 40:09.860
But some trees can also be selfish
and steal from their rivals.

40:10.980 --> 40:16.620
Or even wage war by sending out
toxins that will harm competitors.

40:24.220 --> 40:28.620
It seems, however, that most trees
do try to help each other.

40:31.620 --> 40:35.020
They raise the alarm when attacked
by leaf-eaters,

40:35.020 --> 40:39.100
leaving other trees time to produce
defensive chemicals.

40:44.060 --> 40:48.260
Those that are dying may send their
food reserves to their neighbours.

40:50.060 --> 40:54.220
And some individuals
known as mother trees

40:54.220 --> 40:57.580
recognise their own offspring,

40:57.580 --> 41:00.140
and will channel resources to
them...

41:04.300 --> 41:08.620
..so giving their young the best
possible start in life.

41:29.060 --> 41:32.300
As the harshness of winter
approaches...

41:34.340 --> 41:41.340
..temperate woodlands from
Russia to Canada

41:41.340 --> 41:45.180
are now in a race to shut down.

42:11.420 --> 42:15.620
The green pigment in the leaves
starts to break down

42:15.620 --> 42:19.060
and nutrients are withdrawn
into the branches.

42:21.460 --> 42:24.220
The chemical substances
that are left behind

42:24.220 --> 42:29.260
then create one of the most
spectacular displays of colour

42:29.260 --> 42:31.340
in the whole of nature.

43:28.380 --> 43:33.660
The first freezing nights of winter
bring with them a killer.

43:36.820 --> 43:38.860
Frost.

43:44.460 --> 43:48.460
Stems, when frozen, rupture.

43:51.420 --> 43:55.540
And flowers of ice
form in the chilly air.

44:29.060 --> 44:32.460
For some, winter brings dormancy.

44:34.580 --> 44:37.540
For others, it brings death.

44:48.300 --> 44:51.620
Another cycle of the seasons

44:51.620 --> 44:53.660
comes to an end.

45:08.500 --> 45:11.340
Plants all across the seasonal world

45:11.340 --> 45:15.580
have developed many different
strategies for success.

45:15.580 --> 45:22.620
But they all depend on the seasons
changing reliably year after year.

45:22.620 --> 45:25.380
It doesn't matter whether you live
for 3,000 years

45:25.380 --> 45:27.980
or just a few months,

45:27.980 --> 45:32.140
everything depends on you getting
the timing just right.

45:35.820 --> 45:38.060
But in our changing world,

45:38.060 --> 45:41.500
this is becoming a greater challenge
every year.

45:44.260 --> 45:48.060
And even the most hardy
and resilient of plants

45:48.060 --> 45:50.100
are starting to struggle.

45:59.540 --> 46:05.100
These sequoia trees are the giants
of the natural world,

46:05.100 --> 46:08.980
the largest living thing
on the planet.

46:08.980 --> 46:12.300
They can grow to almost
100 metres tall

46:12.300 --> 46:14.340
and 11 metres across.

46:17.100 --> 46:20.700
Their bark alone can be over a
half-a-metre thick.

46:21.820 --> 46:28.620
They're also among the oldest,
some living to over 3,000 years.

46:28.620 --> 46:31.580
And to achieve such age and size,

46:31.580 --> 46:34.780
they need very particular living
conditions,

46:34.780 --> 46:38.500
such as are found here in the
Sierra Nevada mountains

46:38.500 --> 46:40.540
of California.

46:45.460 --> 46:48.140
Not only do they need energy
from the sun but,

46:48.140 --> 46:55.540
critically, they also require
up to 4,000 litres of water a day.

46:55.540 --> 47:00.220
So they are almost entirely reliant
on the seasonal snowmelt.

47:06.980 --> 47:10.740
But recent years have brought
longer, hotter summers

47:10.740 --> 47:15.220
and their source of water
is becoming increasingly unreliable.

47:21.900 --> 47:23.940
Scientists are discovering

47:23.940 --> 47:27.660
that even these seemingly
indestructible giants

47:27.660 --> 47:31.540
are now starting to show
signs of vulnerability.

47:34.340 --> 47:37.580
Some are shedding their needles
and branches

47:37.580 --> 47:40.300
as a way of conserving
precious water.

47:51.220 --> 47:55.100
But for others, climate change
has already been fatal.

47:57.220 --> 48:01.340
10% of them have been lost
in just the last few years.

48:12.300 --> 48:16.020
A single giant sequoia
in its lifetime

48:16.020 --> 48:20.340
can produce 100 million seeds.

48:20.340 --> 48:23.220
These, in my hand, from one cone,

48:23.220 --> 48:26.940
are more than enough
to start a completely new forest.

48:29.540 --> 48:34.340
But they can only do such a thing
in a world where the seasons change

48:34.340 --> 48:36.380
with some reliability.

48:38.660 --> 48:43.660
Today, our climate is changing,
bringing an unprecedented level

48:43.660 --> 48:48.740
of unpredictability
all across the seasonal world.

48:51.060 --> 48:56.260
The question is, can we curb
climate change sufficiently

48:56.260 --> 49:00.300
to ensure that the seasons will
continue?

49:00.300 --> 49:04.220
Only if we can do that will the
future of seasonal plants,

49:04.220 --> 49:08.580
including these magnificent trees,
be assured.

49:32.020 --> 49:34.220
During filming The Green Planet,

49:34.220 --> 49:38.420
it wasn't only the plants that
struggled to get their timing right.

49:38.420 --> 49:41.580
The increasing unpredictability
of the seasons

49:41.580 --> 49:43.980
made it frustratingly difficult
for the crew

49:43.980 --> 49:46.660
to be in the right place
at the right time.

49:47.780 --> 49:49.820
Whether the height of summer...

49:49.820 --> 49:54.660
We are in the middle of a biblical
rainstorm.

49:54.660 --> 49:57.660
..or a quiet autumnal afternoon...

49:57.660 --> 50:00.980
This is crazy.
Hurricanes are no joke.

50:00.980 --> 50:03.300
..they were always kept
on their toes.

50:04.300 --> 50:07.100
That's really scary. Ooh!

50:08.740 --> 50:10.780
Sometimes very numb ones.

50:12.900 --> 50:15.980
It's been the most snow they've had
for 38 years,

50:15.980 --> 50:19.820
and I think this is now our
fifth filming trip in a row

50:19.820 --> 50:23.460
where the seasons haven't done
what they're predictably meant to do

50:23.460 --> 50:25.780
every year.

50:25.780 --> 50:29.780
And these challenges continue
in attempting to find and film

50:29.780 --> 50:34.180
an elusive plant with a remarkable
survival strategy.

50:35.900 --> 50:37.940
The fire lily.

50:47.100 --> 50:51.100
Somewhere out there is a tiny, tiny
red plant...

50:51.100 --> 50:53.140
..in all of that.

51:02.980 --> 51:05.580
Travelling to South Africa
at the height of summer...

51:08.260 --> 51:10.820
..the crew witnessed many
extraordinary flowers

51:10.820 --> 51:12.860
bursting into bloom.

51:15.060 --> 51:19.180
But if they are to see
a fire lily, they need a fire.

51:22.380 --> 51:25.500
None of the team have filmed
wildfire before -

51:25.500 --> 51:27.660
not something to be underestimated.

51:29.140 --> 51:32.420
In most cases, with wildfires,
is that, when they go wrong,

51:32.420 --> 51:34.620
they go wrong radically,
and it's very unforgiving.

51:34.620 --> 51:36.940
If you get caught on the wrong side
of a fire

51:36.940 --> 51:38.820
because you want to get
that special shot,

51:38.820 --> 51:40.740
there's a possibility you can get
killed.

51:40.740 --> 51:42.460
That's really what it comes down to.

51:42.460 --> 51:45.580
And after some understandably
studious note-taking...

51:47.340 --> 51:50.140
..it's time to put their training
to the test.

52:00.860 --> 52:04.260
The fire's just racing up a gully
behind me.

52:04.260 --> 52:07.740
The heat is intense. You just...
You can't even stand to be, like,

52:07.740 --> 52:09.780
five metres from it. It's insane.

52:12.860 --> 52:14.900
Whoa!

52:16.180 --> 52:20.500
This is what any fire lilies here
should be waiting for.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.620
Jeepers.

52:32.940 --> 52:37.220
But fynbos wildfires are starting
to become fiercer than in the past.

52:38.620 --> 52:41.540
Something fire chief Reinard Geldenhuys

52:41.540 --> 52:43.780
knows first-hand.

52:43.780 --> 52:47.260
Nowadays, we're experiencing
more extreme temperature conditions

52:47.260 --> 52:49.300
and more extreme wind conditions,

52:49.300 --> 52:52.740
which exacerbates a fynbos fire.

52:54.740 --> 52:58.460
Fynbos fire in full tilt,
with a strong wind behind it,

52:58.460 --> 53:01.100
is an animal that's just
running wild.

53:02.420 --> 53:05.340
It's a very frightening sight
if you're standing in front of it.

53:11.660 --> 53:15.100
Guided by the experience of the
fire crew,

53:15.100 --> 53:19.380
the team are able to safely capture
the full fury of the blaze.

53:22.940 --> 53:27.740
It's given me a complete new
appreciation for fire.

53:27.740 --> 53:30.620
How intensely it burns
and how quickly it roars

53:30.620 --> 53:32.660
through this environment.

53:33.700 --> 53:37.020
And the fact that any plants
can survive afterwards

53:37.020 --> 53:39.060
is just... Yeah, it's crazy.

53:42.700 --> 53:44.780
As destructive as it seems,

53:44.780 --> 53:48.060
the fire has been part of this
ecosystem for millennia.

53:49.140 --> 53:52.380
Fires should refresh and regenerate
the landscape.

53:53.900 --> 53:58.380
Worryingly, however, this fine
balance between plant and fire

53:58.380 --> 54:01.060
is beginning to shift.

54:01.060 --> 54:04.780
More extreme wildfires may
spell disaster.

54:06.620 --> 54:08.820
If you disturb the soil in a
fynbos system,

54:08.820 --> 54:11.100
you're going to lose
a lot of species.

54:11.100 --> 54:14.300
Bigger, hotter fires can burn
the soil there

54:14.300 --> 54:16.340
and burn out all the seeds.

54:17.380 --> 54:20.420
And for the species that have these
really intricate strategies,

54:20.420 --> 54:23.860
like the fire lily,
it really is a difficult game.

54:25.620 --> 54:29.060
Every year is getting hotter
and potentially drier.

54:29.060 --> 54:31.940
So it's kind of becoming
Russian roulette

54:31.940 --> 54:33.980
for a lot of the species here.

54:43.940 --> 54:45.980
In the fire's aftermath,

54:45.980 --> 54:48.700
the crew must now try to find
a tiny flower...

54:50.820 --> 54:53.780
..but have any survived the blaze?

54:53.780 --> 54:56.580
It just looks completely dead,
the whole valley.

55:02.900 --> 55:06.060
There's nothing for it
but to get their hands dirty.

55:08.420 --> 55:11.460
Searching in the ash is a grubby
business.

55:17.620 --> 55:19.660
I feel...

55:19.660 --> 55:22.020
..disgusting.

55:22.020 --> 55:26.380
After scouring this mountainside
just days after it burned...

55:27.580 --> 55:31.380
..they finally find the
first signs of regeneration.

55:34.700 --> 55:38.300
Wow. That's what it's all about.
That's the fire lily.

55:38.300 --> 55:41.540
It's like a pop of bright red
against all the black.

55:42.740 --> 55:45.700
I mean, that's amazing.
There's another one over there,

55:45.700 --> 55:47.740
and there's another one behind us.

55:49.100 --> 55:51.580
This place hasn't burned for
15 years,

55:51.580 --> 55:55.340
so they've been sat underground
waiting for this precise moment

55:55.340 --> 55:57.500
for that entire time.
And then, within two weeks,

55:57.500 --> 56:00.340
they're up and they're flowering.
It's incredible.

56:01.660 --> 56:05.260
This time, the fire lilies here
succeeded in flowering.

56:05.260 --> 56:08.340
But in the 15 years since they
last bloomed,

56:08.340 --> 56:12.820
the Earth has experienced
ten of the warmest years on record.

56:14.340 --> 56:16.740
You know, there's huge debates
about climate change -

56:16.740 --> 56:19.020
how real is it, really, and so on.

56:19.020 --> 56:22.660
Erm, we experience it in the fire.

56:22.660 --> 56:25.980
It's more intense, burns easier,
burns longer.

56:27.620 --> 56:30.900
In the past, we used to have one big
fire per season,

56:30.900 --> 56:33.140
and we said,
"Ja, that was a big one."

56:33.140 --> 56:36.220
Now we have five to six big ones
per season.

56:37.740 --> 56:41.140
If we don't change our ways,
we are going to reach a point where

56:41.140 --> 56:45.340
fires are burning with such ferocity
that it will destroy the landscape.

56:47.820 --> 56:51.260
And in recent times, a
rapidly changing climate

56:51.260 --> 56:54.340
has led to some of the biggest fires
in living memory -

56:54.340 --> 56:57.820
not just in South Africa,
but around the world.

56:59.100 --> 57:02.940
The next five to ten years
are going to be pretty scary

57:02.940 --> 57:06.020
to actually see what this has done
to the ecosystem.

57:07.180 --> 57:10.740
Let's hope that the next time
this fire lily blooms,

57:10.740 --> 57:14.060
it will find a world in which it
can still survive.

57:19.020 --> 57:21.060
Next time on The Green Planet...

57:22.660 --> 57:24.700
..desert worlds.

57:26.260 --> 57:28.340
A landscape of extremes...

57:30.060 --> 57:32.260
..where water equals life.

57:36.460 --> 57:38.500
It only takes a drop.

57:41.780 --> 57:45.220
The Open University has produced
a poster

57:45.220 --> 57:49.820
that explores the vital role
that plants have for our planet.

57:49.820 --> 57:52.940
