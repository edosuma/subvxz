05:37.903 --> 05:39.972
I just needed to warm up.

What are they?

10:50.749 --> 10:52.017

10:52.050 --> 10:53.485
- What do you mean you're sorry?

10:53.518 --> 10:55.254
- I can't let go.

10:55.287 --> 10:56.388
- What?

10:56.421 --> 10:57.423
Mark, what do you mean?

10:57.456 --> 10:58.390
I can't let go?

(dramatic music)

11:20.545 --> 11:24.383

11:27.052 --> 11:28.320

11:28.353 --> 11:30.156
- And now you're not.

11:33.191 --> 11:35.394
Can I please get back into bed?

11:35.427 --> 11:36.962
You crazy person.

11:40.365 --> 11:41.701
It's all good.

11:44.469 --> 11:45.471
- Oh I know.

11:46.338 --> 11:47.172
I know like.

11:47.205 --> 11:49.808
Ouch, did you just pinch me?

11:49.841 --> 11:51.510
- Just double checking.

11:51.543 --> 11:53.412
- Double check yourself, you
wank.

11:53.445 --> 11:55.881
- Okay, we'll both awake now.

11:55.914 --> 11:56.782
Thanks.

11:57.516 --> 12:00.252
(Betty gasping)

12:05.457 --> 12:07.159
- It seemed so real.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.328
- What was it?

12:13.365 --> 12:15.267
- I was drowning.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.036
- You were drowning?

12:18.303 --> 12:19.104
- Yeah.

12:19.137 --> 12:22.108
And there were these, these
things.

12:27.579 --> 12:30.816
- And you were yelling, "Mark,
stop."

12:31.550 --> 12:33.152
- Did I?

12:33.185 --> 12:35.988
- Tell me, how were you
drowning?

12:37.355 --> 12:38.557
- In the river.

12:40.826 --> 12:43.796
- I was drowning you, wasn't I?

12:43.829 --> 12:45.464
- You were there.

12:45.497 --> 12:50.169
- It doesn't sound like I
was throwing you a rope.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.270
Unbelievable.

12:52.137 --> 12:53.372
- What?

12:53.405 --> 12:55.374
- This wasn't my idea, remember?

12:55.407 --> 12:57.242
- What are you talking about?

12:57.275 --> 12:59.545
- Once we get through
those doors, that's it.

12:59.578 --> 13:00.445
- Mark.
- Your words.

13:00.478 --> 13:01.413
- Mark.

13:01.446 --> 13:03.949
It was a dream.
- I'm not pulling you under.

13:03.982 --> 13:05.984
(Betty speaking indistinctly)

13:06.017 --> 13:07.486
I thought you come to terms with
this.

13:07.519 --> 13:08.921
- Honestly, Mark.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.122
- We're supposed to be a couple
of ghosts.

13:10.155 --> 13:11.523
- Calm down.
- Remember?

13:11.556 --> 13:12.391
- Calm down.

13:12.424 --> 13:13.425
- Ghosts.

13:13.458 --> 13:16.462
(insects chirping)

13:34.346 --> 13:35.981
What the hell are you doing?

13:36.014 --> 13:36.882
- Boo.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.385
- Did you just call me boo?

13:40.418 --> 13:41.253
- No.

13:43.054 --> 13:44.957
(both laughing)

13:44.990 --> 13:47.192
- Just, good 'cause you know my
thoughts

13:47.225 --> 13:48.493
on calling each other boo.

13:48.526 --> 13:50.495
(both laughing)

13:50.528 --> 13:51.897
- Get over here

13:54.499 --> 13:56.168
- Taste like fabric softener.

13:56.201 --> 13:57.536
- Very sweet fabric softener.

13:57.569 --> 13:59.638
- Yeah bit of my active plasm.

13:59.671 --> 14:00.506
- Yuck.

14:02.507 --> 14:03.375
Disgusting.

14:03.408 --> 14:04.410
- I'm sorry.

14:06.411 --> 14:07.980
- You will be sorry.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.150
- No, I'm sorry for getting
worked up.

14:13.251 --> 14:14.620
- It's okay, you were just.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.889
- We're in this together.

14:18.123 --> 14:18.991

(insects chirping)

14:21.092 --> 14:22.060
(both laughing)

14:22.093 --> 14:23.662

14:24.496 --> 14:25.330
- Oh.

14:25.363 --> 14:27.132
(both laughing)

14:27.165 --> 14:28.133
Are you okay?

14:28.166 --> 14:30.302
- Yeah, no, it's just
that I've seen a ghost.

14:30.335 --> 14:31.169
(both laughing)

14:31.202 --> 14:32.037
- Shut up.

Jesus.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.125
Fuck.

16:00.158 --> 16:01.026
- What?

16:02.160 --> 16:03.562
- You startled me.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.132
God.

16:07.165 --> 16:08.066
- What are you doing?
- Lend me

16:08.100 --> 16:09.101
one of those skinny arms of
yours okay.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.002
- What?

16:10.035 --> 16:10.702
- Well, you know.
- What's under that?

16:10.736 --> 16:12.404
- My fat arms, they can't fit.

16:12.437 --> 16:13.739
So I'm actually gonna need.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.107
- Mark, I'm not doing anything

16:15.140 --> 16:16.475
until you tell me what is under
that.

16:16.508 --> 16:17.342
- It's a mouse, okay,

16:17.375 --> 16:19.077
it's a mouse.
- What?

16:19.110 --> 16:22.314
- Do you know, big ears, long
tail.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.182
- I know what a mouse is,
dickhead.

16:24.215 --> 16:25.050
- What?
- Why are you

16:25.083 --> 16:26.051
freaking out about it?

16:26.084 --> 16:30.055
- Because I don't want
it here when you know.

16:31.222 --> 16:32.057
- Why?

16:32.090 --> 16:32.891
(birds chirping)

16:32.924 --> 16:34.593
- I don't want it crawling on
me.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.396
(birds chirping)

16:37.429 --> 16:39.831
- You know, you're not
gonna be in a state to care.

16:39.864 --> 16:44.036
- It's gonna go straight
for my eyes, I know it.

16:47.105 --> 16:48.774
- It really doesn't matter,
Mark.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.309
- Oh, it matters.

16:51.476 --> 16:53.745
Hey, don't, don't, just.

16:53.778 --> 16:55.680

16:57.649 --> 16:58.484
Betty, I.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.322
Betty.

17:04.355 --> 17:05.657
Betty.

17:05.690 --> 17:08.560
(birds chirping)

18:13.491 --> 18:15.360
Look, Betty, I.

18:15.393 --> 18:16.261
- Get him?

18:17.395 --> 18:18.263
- Get him?

18:19.597 --> 18:21.733
Pretty sure it was a her.

18:21.766 --> 18:24.503
Only a woman can torment me so
bad.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.871
- So that's a no.

18:27.872 --> 18:29.208
- That's a no.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.211
Look.

18:32.244 --> 18:34.713
- You know what the best
part about all of this is?

18:34.746 --> 18:35.847
- What's that?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.750
(birds chirping)

18:40.285 --> 18:44.289
- We're gonna have to
live with what we've done.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.160
(birds chirping)

18:51.196 --> 18:53.865
- I shouldn't have grabbed you.

18:53.898 --> 18:54.799
I'm sorry, I,

18:56.634 --> 19:00.572
I was in a frenzy and I didn't
sleep well.

19:00.605 --> 19:01.440
I'm sorry.

19:03.841 --> 19:06.211
Ah, it's okay, Mark, I forgive
you.

19:06.244 --> 19:08.514
It is a honeymoon after all.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.550
You really mean it, Betty?

19:11.583 --> 19:14.619
Oh, really, really, no it's kept
you up.

19:14.652 --> 19:17.523
I mean, if you're insisting on
it.

19:20.024 --> 19:22.327
Shall I Irish up your tea?

19:27.932 --> 19:30.802
- I think I'll finish it as it
is.

19:32.036 --> 19:33.272
- All righty.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.176
(birds chirping)

20:06.537 --> 20:09.541
I hope they find the bad part of
me.

20:10.642 --> 20:11.577
Cut it out.

20:13.511 --> 20:16.381
So I can leave it behind.

21:39.997 --> 21:42.768
(both laughing)

21:43.935 --> 21:47.005
Oh, I could have been so many
things.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.142
So many things, now if you think
about it.

21:51.175 --> 21:52.711
- A little drunk?

21:53.811 --> 21:54.746
- Me?

21:54.779 --> 21:55.613
I'm flying.

21:55.646 --> 21:56.881
(both laughing)

21:56.914 --> 21:59.351
- It's a bird, it's a plane.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.721
- Kind of looks like a moose to
me.

22:02.754 --> 22:04.155
- Where?

22:04.188 --> 22:05.757
You don't even have your eyes
open.

22:05.790 --> 22:06.624
- It's that.

22:06.657 --> 22:07.492
(both laughing)

22:07.525 --> 22:08.360
That's the one.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.128
- That confirms it.

22:10.161 --> 22:11.162
Mark's drunk.

22:11.195 --> 22:12.897
(both laughing)

22:12.930 --> 22:14.099
- Yes.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.000
Yes I am.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.802
- Hmm.

22:17.835 --> 22:20.672
(birds chirping)

22:23.107 --> 22:25.510
- [Mark] Can you feel that?

22:26.477 --> 22:27.679
- [Betty] What?

22:29.981 --> 22:32.484
- [Mark] It's the world moving
under you.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.853
(Betty laughing)

22:34.886 --> 22:38.957
- [Betty] I think I need to cut
you off.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.860
- [Mark] It's the grass, the
bugs.

22:43.127 --> 22:44.863
It's a world growing beneath us.

22:44.896 --> 22:45.964
- [Betty] Mm.

22:45.997 --> 22:50.669
- [Mark] I just want to sink
in and let it absorb me.

22:53.070 --> 22:55.073
- But you don't want a
mouse nibbling on you.

22:55.106 --> 22:57.142
- Well, I don't want to be
chewed up

22:57.175 --> 22:58.877
and shat out on the concrete.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.478
The things only rot.

23:00.511 --> 23:02.781
(Betty laughing)

23:02.814 --> 23:05.550
(gentle music)

23:06.851 --> 23:08.854
Well, what do you think?

23:10.922 --> 23:11.756
- [Betty] Mm.

23:11.789 --> 23:14.059
I try not to think about it.

23:15.526 --> 23:16.595
- [Mark] Why?

23:18.896 --> 23:21.833
- [Betty] It doesn't matter.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.468
- But it's everything.

23:23.501 --> 23:26.171
(birds chirping)

23:29.707 --> 23:32.144
- No, I guess in my situation,

23:35.513 --> 23:37.081
the more that you think about
it,

23:37.114 --> 23:39.885
the more it just rules your
life.

23:40.885 --> 23:43.755
You just have to accept it.

23:43.788 --> 23:45.123
Becoming nothing.

23:46.757 --> 23:48.226
- Becoming nothing?

23:49.994 --> 23:51.763
You become everything.

23:51.796 --> 23:54.766
Every.
- No mark, it's no longer me.

23:54.799 --> 23:57.268
(gentle music)

23:57.301 --> 24:00.172
(birds chirping)

24:03.040 --> 24:05.877
Doesn't matter what happens
after.

24:05.910 --> 24:08.546
(gentle music)

24:08.579 --> 24:12.517
At some point, the world
will lose its gravity.

24:13.618 --> 24:16.054
(gentle music)

24:16.087 --> 24:17.055
(birds chirping)

24:17.088 --> 24:18.790
(gentle music)

24:18.823 --> 24:21.693
And we all float up into the
blue.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.129
Everyone and everything.

24:25.162 --> 24:27.165
(gentle music)

24:27.198 --> 24:29.133
(birds chirping)

24:29.166 --> 24:30.902
Swallowed by the sky.

24:30.935 --> 24:33.905
(gentle music)

24:33.938 --> 24:36.941
(birds chirping)

24:36.974 --> 24:39.611
(gentle music)

24:45.983 --> 24:48.219
(birds chirping)

24:48.252 --> 24:50.555
(gentle music)

24:50.588 --> 24:54.259
(both speaking indistinctly)

25:09.340 --> 25:10.174
Get it out.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.976
It's sitting right there in your
belly.

25:12.009 --> 25:13.778
You'll feel better, come on.

25:13.811 --> 25:14.646
(Mark vomiting)

25:14.679 --> 25:15.346
(Mark coughing)

25:15.379 --> 25:16.214
There we go.

25:16.247 --> 25:17.249
There we go.

25:18.282 --> 25:19.617
Good boy.

25:19.650 --> 25:22.787
That's a good boy.
- Just fuck off.

25:22.820 --> 25:26.090
- No, hey, hey keep, keep
stroking.

25:26.123 --> 25:28.192
- You're giving me mixed
messages here big guy.

25:28.225 --> 25:30.862
- Just, just stop teasing okay.

25:32.129 --> 25:35.267
It is bad enough I ruined our
weekend.

25:36.300 --> 25:39.304
- You haven't ruined anything.

25:39.337 --> 25:43.007
- Look, I can, I can usually
handle my piss better.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.142
- Mm.

25:44.175 --> 25:45.610
I beg to differ.

25:47.211 --> 25:50.114
- Well, we hardly played
any drinking games.

25:50.147 --> 25:52.884
- Mark, they're hardly
any fun with two people.

25:52.917 --> 25:53.852
It's just us.

25:53.885 --> 25:57.255
- Well yeah, but you know, we
could play,

25:57.288 --> 25:59.724
we could play Categories or,

26:00.825 --> 26:01.960
or I've Never.

26:03.928 --> 26:08.333
- Never have I ever tried
to kill myself with alcohol.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.635
- Not myself.

26:11.936 --> 26:12.770
- Okay.

26:12.803 --> 26:14.806
Who did you try to kill?

26:16.807 --> 26:17.809
- Nevermind.

26:19.043 --> 26:22.847
- Never have I ever
tried to murder anyone.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.249
- I don't have a drink to, to
drink.

26:25.282 --> 26:26.117
- Fuck off.

26:26.150 --> 26:27.652
(Betty laughing)

26:27.685 --> 26:30.655
Who did you try to kill, huh?

26:30.688 --> 26:31.356
- Who?

26:31.389 --> 26:32.257
- Don't worry about it.

26:32.290 --> 26:35.126
- No, now is the time for
confessions.

26:35.159 --> 26:37.061
We're in a safe place.

26:37.094 --> 26:38.997
Who did you try to kill?

26:39.030 --> 26:40.198
Come on tell me.

26:40.231 --> 26:41.099
Who, who?

26:43.100 --> 26:43.969
Mark.

26:45.169 --> 26:46.237
- It was you.

26:47.405 --> 26:50.275
(birds chirping)

26:52.910 --> 26:53.778
- What?

26:58.282 --> 26:59.150
- Betty.

27:01.385 --> 27:02.253
Betty.

27:03.454 --> 27:04.789
- Mark, what do you mean?

27:04.822 --> 27:06.324
- [Mark] Betty, I, I.

27:06.357 --> 27:09.361
(insects chirping)

27:55.206 --> 27:57.942
- I'll give you one chance.

27:57.975 --> 27:59.277
- Come on, Betts.

27:59.310 --> 28:02.113
I'm already feeling the
hangover.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.116
- Tell me what you did.

28:09.854 --> 28:13.224
- I made a mistake, you know,
that's all.

28:19.296 --> 28:22.067
- What the fuck did you do to
me?

28:23.300 --> 28:24.802
- I didn't plan it okay.

28:24.835 --> 28:29.040
I made a decision in the
moment, a stupid decision.

28:31.408 --> 28:34.145
- I'm glad you put so
much thought into it.

28:34.178 --> 28:37.315
- No, no, no, no, that's
all I've thought about.

28:37.348 --> 28:38.983
You were suffering,

28:39.016 --> 28:40.184
okay, and I couldn't stand it.

28:40.217 --> 28:43.288
I knew you would never ask
it of me, but I could see it.

28:45.256 --> 28:47.258
- See what, hmm?

28:47.291 --> 28:48.159
- You.

28:49.493 --> 28:51.462
You wanted to, you know.

28:51.495 --> 28:52.363
- Die.

28:53.430 --> 28:54.299
- Yeah.

28:56.033 --> 28:59.303
- I can't believe what I'm
hearing.

28:59.336 --> 29:02.573
And you just planned to
act on your ESP, huh?

29:02.606 --> 29:04.108
- I didn't plan it, okay.

29:04.141 --> 29:06.811
- When didn't you plan it then?

29:08.012 --> 29:09.514
- This last summer.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.917
- The Engagement party.

29:14.251 --> 29:15.586
You son of a bitch.

29:15.619 --> 29:16.587
- I didn't.
- You son of a bitch.

29:16.620 --> 29:17.488
- I didn't plan it, okay.

29:17.521 --> 29:19.257
Your glass, it was just there.

29:19.290 --> 29:22.226
And you, you have to
understand how horrible I felt.

29:22.259 --> 29:23.194
- Horrible?

29:25.196 --> 29:27.465
- Would you like me to
describe the feeling

29:27.498 --> 29:30.067
of a liver resection?

29:30.100 --> 29:33.004
Make you understand the
pain, the torture that I,

29:33.037 --> 29:35.940
that I was in for a month.

29:35.973 --> 29:39.277
They thought that I tried to
kill myself.

29:39.310 --> 29:44.248
Have you the slightest idea
what you have put me through.

29:44.281 --> 29:46.083
Do you have any idea what it's
like living

29:46.116 --> 29:49.020
with everyone thinking that
I tried to kill myself.

29:49.053 --> 29:50.054
- I understand.

29:50.087 --> 29:51.289
- No you don't.

29:52.556 --> 29:55.259
It's enough that I'm sick and
you don't fucking understand,

29:55.292 --> 29:57.562
otherwise you wouldn't have.

30:02.466 --> 30:07.272
I can't believe that you are
capable of doing that to me.

30:08.405 --> 30:10.408
I want you to leave now.

30:14.044 --> 30:14.913
Get out.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.548
- You know, I only did
it because I love you.

30:17.581 --> 30:20.218
- Fuck off Mark, honestly.
- No, I need you.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.887
You've gotta understand.
- Get the fuck out.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.622
- Listen to me please.

30:27.024 --> 30:28.292
You were not the first person I
love

30:28.325 --> 30:30.995
who'd asked me to end it, okay.

30:32.263 --> 30:33.898
- I didn't ask you.

30:44.141 --> 30:46.077
- You know what I mean?

30:57.421 --> 31:00.124
(Betty crying)

31:08.032 --> 31:10.535
(gentle music)

31:24.281 --> 31:26.317
(insects chirping)

31:26.350 --> 31:29.087
(gentle music)

31:40.698 --> 31:42.567
We'll rise and go now,

31:44.601 --> 31:46.571
go to Innisfree,

31:47.671 --> 31:54.445
in a small cabin made of
clay and wattles... (inaudible)

31:57.214 --> 31:59.317
Something about bees.

31:59.350 --> 32:02.053
(gentle music)

32:05.189 --> 32:07.592
For I shall have some peace.

32:09.493 --> 32:10.328
Some peace.

32:10.361 --> 32:11.696
(gentle music)

32:11.729 --> 32:14.398
The peace comes dropping slow.

32:14.431 --> 32:16.767
Midnight's all a glimmer.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.436
Noon a purple glow.

32:19.636 --> 32:22.640
An evening full of the linnet's
wings.

32:23.807 --> 32:25.977
I will arise and go now.

32:27.678 --> 32:32.016
For always, night and day,
I hear lake water lapping

32:32.049 --> 32:34.285
with low sound by the shore

32:35.786 --> 32:40.458
while I stand on the roadway
or on the pavement's gray.

32:42.092 --> 32:45.463
I hear it in the deep
heart's core. (gentle music)

32:47.664 --> 32:50.601
(insects chirping)

34:12.916 --> 34:15.586
(gentle music)

34:24.661 --> 34:27.498
(birds chirping)

34:36.607 --> 34:39.376
- So what's on the agenda
for this afternoon?

34:39.409 --> 34:41.512
- Ah, well there is a bush walk
close by

34:41.545 --> 34:44.849
that I thought we could
do, if you're up for it.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.417
- Yeah.

34:46.450 --> 34:48.219
- So you're up for it?

34:48.252 --> 34:49.887
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.555
- No, no, I mean you would be.

34:51.588 --> 34:53.757
It's just, you know,
last time I kinda had to

34:53.790 --> 34:55.726
carry you back.
- Yeah.

34:58.195 --> 35:00.664
I'm in a much better state,
so I'm up for it okay.

35:00.697 --> 35:02.800
- Okay good, good.

35:02.833 --> 35:05.302
In that case, I've got a
surprise for you.

35:05.335 --> 35:06.437
- Gosh, what?

35:07.604 --> 35:09.573
- It's something you love.

35:09.606 --> 35:10.475
- What?

35:11.575 --> 35:13.177
- Finish your tea.

35:14.878 --> 35:16.580
Come on, finish your tea.

35:16.613 --> 35:18.716
(birds chirping)

35:18.749 --> 35:19.583
- Tell me.

35:19.617 --> 35:22.353
- Finish your tea, I'll finish
mine.

35:22.386 --> 35:25.256
(birds chirping)

35:30.360 --> 35:32.296
Now look in the bottom.

35:41.438 --> 35:42.406
- Didn't you learn your lesson

35:42.439 --> 35:44.642
about spiking your girlfriend?

35:44.675 --> 35:46.510
- You love acid?

35:46.543 --> 35:48.212
- That's not the point, Mark.

35:48.245 --> 35:49.547
What do you mean?

35:49.580 --> 35:50.681
- Okay, look, you're gonna have
to relax

35:50.714 --> 35:51.515
if you wanna have a good time.

35:51.548 --> 35:52.816
- Are you actually serious right
now?

35:52.849 --> 35:55.252
- For the next 10 to 12 hours.

35:55.285 --> 35:57.621
- You are absolutely
unbelievable.

35:57.654 --> 35:58.523
- Betty.

36:03.594 --> 36:04.462
- Fuck.

36:05.929 --> 36:07.965
(cupboard banging)

36:07.998 --> 36:10.701
(Betty gasping)

36:23.914 --> 36:26.784
(birds chirping)

36:32.422 --> 36:33.457
- Here.

36:33.490 --> 36:34.925
- I'm okay.

36:34.958 --> 36:36.493
- I didn't say you weren't.

36:36.526 --> 36:40.564
- Just, I'm done with
being tired, I'm done.

36:40.597 --> 36:41.532
- You're done?

36:41.565 --> 36:42.967
- I'm done.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.802
- This exactly what I
said was gonna happen.

36:44.835 --> 36:47.571
Now I'm gonna have to carry
you back down the hill,

36:47.604 --> 36:49.340
just like last time.

36:50.340 --> 36:53.611
- You know what this
weather reminds me of?

36:53.644 --> 36:56.513
- The wife and kids you
left back in Sydney.

36:56.546 --> 36:57.648
"Dante's Inferno?"

36:57.681 --> 36:59.817
No, no, your rational fear of
fire ants.

36:59.850 --> 37:04.488
- There's nothing irrational
about fearing fire ants.

37:04.521 --> 37:05.189
- Well?

37:05.222 --> 37:07.458
- No, I'm done talking to you.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.560
- Okay, I wanna know, I wanna
know.

37:09.593 --> 37:11.662
No, you're being a sarcastic
asshole.

37:11.695 --> 37:13.030
- I know.

37:13.063 --> 37:14.999
Don't you love me for who I am.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.900
- You get enough love from
yourself.

37:16.933 --> 37:17.868
(birds chirping)

37:17.901 --> 37:19.270
- Ouch.

37:19.303 --> 37:20.771
Finally comes out,

37:20.804 --> 37:22.773
the truth of how you really
feel.

37:22.806 --> 37:23.807
Well, I beg to differ.

37:23.841 --> 37:27.077
- For once we have a
European summer, you know.

37:27.110 --> 37:29.580
It's warm, but not too hard.

37:31.014 --> 37:34.685
Like the forest could just
open up onto the Mediterranean.

37:34.718 --> 37:36.787
- Yeah, it beautiful.

37:36.820 --> 37:38.389
- Yeah.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.491
Gosh, I'd do anything to go
swimming

37:40.524 --> 37:43.527
in that blue, blue water again.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.629
- I mean, the temperature's
a bit like it was.

37:45.662 --> 37:49.767
That doesn't exactly look like
we're in Mykonos or Positano,

37:49.800 --> 37:52.069
but I'm pretty happy about that.

37:52.102 --> 37:54.104
I mean, don't take offense,

37:54.137 --> 37:57.841
I'd rather be nowhere else in
the world.

37:57.874 --> 37:59.310
But now is a good a
time as any to tell you,

37:59.343 --> 38:02.780
but I really didn't like that
trip.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.848
- You're just bitter about the
last week.

38:04.881 --> 38:06.850
- I'm bitter I had to
isolate from you, yeah,

38:06.883 --> 38:08.452
but that's not it.

38:10.721 --> 38:12.523
- Mark, you're the one that got
sick.

38:12.556 --> 38:13.724
- Oh, we were both sick.

38:13.757 --> 38:17.961
Look, it's not that, it's
just, I just don't like Europe.

38:17.994 --> 38:20.964
- It's a pretty big continent to
resent.

38:20.997 --> 38:25.769
- Well, it's just so dirty,
all right and crowded.

38:25.802 --> 38:27.471
Oh, do you remember Rome, hmm?

38:27.504 --> 38:28.706
Do you remember the day
you met up with Lily

38:28.739 --> 38:30.441
and I was left to explore alone?

38:30.474 --> 38:32.009
- Yeah, the day you got sick.

38:32.042 --> 38:33.911
- Yeah, I got heat stroke, okay

38:33.944 --> 38:36.146
'cause the weather was
just like this, but hotter.

38:36.179 --> 38:37.581
And we'd seen all the sites,

38:37.614 --> 38:40.084
and so I was just
walking around this city,

38:40.117 --> 38:42.553
taking in the concrete and the
crowds.

38:42.586 --> 38:43.621
And then I got lost.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.356
- Mark, you were sick
'cause you got blind drunk

38:45.389 --> 38:46.056
the night before.

38:46.089 --> 38:46.924
- What?

38:46.957 --> 38:47.892
No.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.494
Well, yes, but that's not the
point okay.

38:50.527 --> 38:53.130
I got lost and I ended
up outside the Rome Zoo,

38:53.163 --> 38:56.166
this bio park or something,
anyway,

38:56.199 --> 38:58.702
I decided to kill some time to
go on in,

38:58.735 --> 39:00.371
maybe it was to get out of the
sun.

39:00.404 --> 39:02.106
I don't know.
- That was your mistake.

39:02.139 --> 39:05.909
- Yeah, well look, I went in
there and that was just awful.

39:05.942 --> 39:07.111
I mean, you'd think places like
that

39:07.144 --> 39:09.079
were outlawed 50 years ago.

39:09.112 --> 39:11.615
Okay, the elephant
enclosure, it had no shade.

39:11.648 --> 39:12.916
So all of them were just pressed
up

39:12.950 --> 39:16.053
against the side of a clay
building, clinging to its
shadow.

39:16.086 --> 39:17.454
And they had wolves all right,

39:17.487 --> 39:19.022
fucking timber wolves in that
heat.

39:19.055 --> 39:21.959
And they were either all
passed out or sedated.

39:21.992 --> 39:24.995
I mean, and the hippo, my God,
that hippo,

39:25.028 --> 39:27.798
he was in an enclosure
the size of our apartment.

39:27.831 --> 39:29.566
The concrete ground of
the pool at its sense,

39:29.599 --> 39:32.636
that was barely the hippo's
length.

39:32.669 --> 39:35.806
Oh my God that fucking hippo.

39:35.839 --> 39:39.710
- So you are basing your whole
judgment of a whole continent

39:39.743 --> 39:42.112
of one trip to a zoo?

39:42.145 --> 39:43.113
- Yeah.

39:43.146 --> 39:46.517
Because Europe made me
feel like that hippo.

39:46.550 --> 39:50.454
- Are you honestly incapable
of enjoying anything?

39:50.487 --> 39:52.823
(birds chirping)

39:52.856 --> 39:54.024
- I think so.

39:54.057 --> 39:56.927
(birds chirping)

39:59.963 --> 40:01.899
I think I'm feeling it.

40:03.033 --> 40:04.635
- What's that?

40:04.668 --> 40:06.070
- It's hitting me.

40:08.038 --> 40:09.106
- The acid,

40:09.139 --> 40:10.674
I almost forgot.

40:10.707 --> 40:12.910
- Are you feeling anything?

40:17.214 --> 40:18.682
- Yeah, I think a smidge.

40:18.715 --> 40:20.050
- Yeah.

40:20.083 --> 40:24.021
- How broccoli of the trees
right now?

40:24.054 --> 40:25.556
- About a six.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.690
(both laughing)

40:26.723 --> 40:28.625
- We're getting there.

40:28.658 --> 40:30.894
Nearly, nearly, nearly.

40:30.927 --> 40:33.564
(gentle music)

40:37.634 --> 40:40.704
(birds chirping)

40:40.737 --> 40:43.240
(gentle music)

40:46.176 --> 40:47.578
(birds chirping)

40:47.611 --> 40:49.580
(gentle music)

40:49.613 --> 40:51.515
That's a lot of green.

40:51.548 --> 40:54.051
(gentle music)

40:55.118 --> 40:57.922
(birds chirping)

40:59.789 --> 41:02.460
(gentle music)

41:03.593 --> 41:05.128
(birds chirping)

41:05.161 --> 41:05.996
Jeez.

41:06.029 --> 41:06.864
Fuck.

41:08.932 --> 41:10.767
A fucking snake.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.169
(gentle music)

41:12.202 --> 41:14.571
(Mark speaking indistinctly)

41:14.604 --> 41:17.241
(birds chirping)

41:17.274 --> 41:19.944
(gentle music)

41:24.180 --> 41:28.685
(people speaking indistinctly)

41:28.718 --> 41:31.188
(gentle music)

41:34.724 --> 41:38.195
(people speaking indistinctly)

41:38.228 --> 41:40.898
(gentle music)

41:41.965 --> 41:44.835
(Mark laughing)

41:44.868 --> 41:45.702
(gentle music)

41:45.735 --> 41:46.670
(birds chirping)

41:46.703 --> 41:47.337
Holy shit.

41:47.370 --> 41:50.040
(gentle music)

42:00.884 --> 42:03.153
(Betty laughing)

42:03.186 --> 42:04.021
- Oh God.

42:04.054 --> 42:06.757
(gentle music)

42:09.693 --> 42:10.561
- Wake up.

42:12.195 --> 42:13.130
- Don't joke.

42:13.163 --> 42:15.265
You know what was the best day
of my life.

42:15.298 --> 42:16.567
- It's the day you met me.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.868
- No.

42:17.901 --> 42:20.137
Unfortunately for your ego,

42:21.404 --> 42:23.173
I was about 12 or 13.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.777
Do you remember those, do
you remember these comments?

42:26.810 --> 42:29.813
The, the, the chain mail or
MySpace?

42:30.814 --> 42:32.349
- Look, I remember MySpace.

42:32.382 --> 42:33.283
I don't remember Yala.

42:33.316 --> 42:34.751
- Yeah.

42:34.784 --> 42:38.221
So it was one of those, you
know.

42:38.254 --> 42:39.790
I think it was like,

42:39.823 --> 42:41.325
"If you pass this on in 10 days,

42:41.358 --> 42:44.227
"then in a week, you'll have
the best day of your life

42:44.260 --> 42:46.196
"and in two weeks you'll
meet the love of your life."

42:46.229 --> 42:47.130
Or something like that.

42:47.164 --> 42:49.199
- Yeah, yeah and if you don't,
you'll die

42:49.232 --> 42:50.767
or the chick from the ring will
get you.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.635
- Yeah.

42:51.668 --> 42:52.336
(both laughing)

42:52.369 --> 42:54.671
- So I passed on one of those.

42:54.704 --> 42:56.640
- Oh, you are what's
wrong with this world.

42:56.673 --> 42:57.942
- Shut up, Mark.

42:59.743 --> 43:00.911
I passed on one of those

43:00.944 --> 43:05.749
and the next week I actually
had the best day of my life.

43:05.782 --> 43:08.051
I don't know, nothing happened
or changed

43:08.084 --> 43:10.721
because of the chain mail, but,

43:11.855 --> 43:14.925
I don't know, I just took
everything in.

43:14.958 --> 43:16.893
I'd never been so present.

43:16.926 --> 43:18.428
(birds chirping)

43:18.461 --> 43:23.767
Things I'd done a million times
suddenly became wonderful.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.436
I don't know, it's hard to
explain.

43:26.469 --> 43:28.372
It wasn't even sunny.

43:28.405 --> 43:31.642
It was raining, but it was
beautiful.

43:33.276 --> 43:34.645
- No, I get it.

43:36.379 --> 43:39.316
Have you had a day like that
since?

43:40.216 --> 43:41.285
- I think so.

43:43.386 --> 43:45.823
Nowhere as good, but I have.

43:47.857 --> 43:51.428
I think it happens when
I have a recurrence.

43:53.763 --> 43:55.032
I think I'm feeling it.

43:55.065 --> 43:57.835
(both laughing)

43:59.836 --> 44:00.871
- Yeah.

44:00.904 --> 44:04.441
I swear I only feel that way on
drugs.

44:04.474 --> 44:05.976
Well, some drugs.

44:07.444 --> 44:10.247
Most kinda just push you away
from it,

44:10.280 --> 44:12.282
from the present.

44:12.315 --> 44:15.085
Now that's the problem.

44:15.118 --> 44:17.021
It's not being present.

44:18.121 --> 44:20.257
I was a bit of a depressed kid.

44:20.290 --> 44:22.893
I think I watched too much TV.

44:23.793 --> 44:27.431
I just, I always wanted
to be somewhere else,

44:28.531 --> 44:30.300
somewhere green.

44:30.333 --> 44:31.368
- Hmm.

44:31.401 --> 44:35.005
- You know, in some
fantasy world full of magic

44:35.038 --> 44:38.308
where I was the chosen
one in a great story.

44:38.341 --> 44:40.778
You know, and I had friends.

44:43.847 --> 44:47.184
God, I was always in my head,
you know,

44:47.217 --> 44:49.486
and I, I never looked around

44:49.519 --> 44:52.322
'cause it just made me sad

44:52.355 --> 44:56.259
'cause it wasn't where I wanted
to be.

44:56.292 --> 45:00.263
Yeah, there's nothing
fantastical about the suburbs.

45:00.296 --> 45:02.900
So I would live in a daydream.

45:05.535 --> 45:08.839
And that way of thinking, you
know, at least for so long,

45:08.872 --> 45:12.009
I think it built pathways in my
brain.

45:13.510 --> 45:16.880
I can't be present and it kills
me.

45:16.913 --> 45:18.982
(gentle music)

45:19.015 --> 45:20.851
It's like I'm drifting.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.219
(gentle music)

45:22.252 --> 45:26.123
Holding my breath as the
waves crash above me.

45:28.224 --> 45:31.795
I wanted that feeling
that you're talking about,

45:31.828 --> 45:32.896
so damn much.

45:34.831 --> 45:38.435
And this weekend I'm starting to
feel it.

45:38.468 --> 45:40.270
(gentle music)

45:40.303 --> 45:42.572
It's like what you said,

45:42.605 --> 45:45.175
it happens after a recurrence.

45:45.208 --> 45:47.477
(gentle music)

45:47.510 --> 45:50.380
It's when you've accepted it,
isn't it?

45:50.413 --> 45:51.248
(gentle music)

45:51.281 --> 45:52.783
I've accepted it.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.118
- I've.

45:55.152 --> 45:59.490
- We're free from our future
so we can finally be present.

46:01.958 --> 46:03.393
We're free.

46:03.426 --> 46:06.096
(gentle music)

46:16.906 --> 46:19.409
(Betty crying)

46:22.612 --> 46:25.282
(gentle music)

46:28.518 --> 46:31.188
(Betty crying)

46:36.159 --> 46:38.796
(gentle music)

46:40.230 --> 46:43.266
(insects chirping)

46:43.299 --> 46:45.635
(gentle music)

46:45.668 --> 46:48.939
(insects chirping)

46:48.972 --> 46:51.441
(gentle music)

47:28.645 --> 47:31.648
(insects chirping)

48:09.352 --> 48:10.654
- Shh, shh, shh.

48:11.754 --> 48:12.623
Shh, shh.

48:13.656 --> 48:15.091
- What?

48:15.124 --> 48:16.459
- Shh.

48:16.492 --> 48:19.363
(dramatic music)

48:25.601 --> 48:28.238
- Come on, go, go, go.

48:28.271 --> 48:31.074
(dramatic music)

48:34.377 --> 48:35.345
- Hey wait.

48:35.378 --> 48:36.212
- Ow.

48:36.245 --> 48:37.180
- No, get off me.

48:37.213 --> 48:39.082
- Shush, shush, do you
want him to find us?

48:39.115 --> 48:40.150
- Don't, don't.

48:40.183 --> 48:41.017
- What?

48:41.050 --> 48:41.718
Don't what?

48:41.751 --> 48:42.585
- Stop.
- What?

48:42.618 --> 48:44.120
- Don't touch me.

48:44.153 --> 48:45.655
- Okay.

48:45.688 --> 48:47.958
Can you please hide with me?

48:47.991 --> 48:49.092
- Where the fuck have you.

48:49.125 --> 48:50.327
- Shh.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.995
- Where have you been?

48:52.028 --> 48:53.597
- Where have I been?

48:55.231 --> 48:56.934
- I don't know, hey.

48:57.667 --> 49:00.003
It's been a long couple of
hours.

49:00.036 --> 49:02.439
I think the acid turned on me.

49:04.107 --> 49:06.109
Hey, why'd you run away?

49:07.510 --> 49:08.478
Betty?

49:08.511 --> 49:09.346
- I.

49:12.248 --> 49:13.450
Things Mark, I.

49:14.684 --> 49:18.221
- You wanna take a seat and
tell me about these things, hmm?

49:18.254 --> 49:20.623
I'll tell you about my stuff.

49:20.656 --> 49:23.593
(insects chirping)

49:29.132 --> 49:30.000
- Fuck.

49:36.339 --> 49:39.242
- What the fuck was that guy
doing?

49:41.310 --> 49:42.478
- I don't know, he sounded like.

49:42.511 --> 49:44.514
- Well he sounded like he was
gonna put us in that hole.

49:44.547 --> 49:47.250
- No, he sounded like familiar.

49:50.153 --> 49:51.254
- [Mark] I need a big stick.

49:51.287 --> 49:53.490
- Mark, are we sure that even
happened?

49:53.523 --> 49:56.526
- Well, it's acid all
right, it's not fucking DMT.

49:56.559 --> 49:57.694
- I know that.

50:03.199 --> 50:04.067
- Nevermind.

50:04.100 --> 50:05.068
- What?

50:05.101 --> 50:08.204
(insects chirping)

50:08.237 --> 50:11.307
- Has this got to do
with why you ran away?

50:11.340 --> 50:14.344
(insects chirping)

50:17.547 --> 50:18.382
May I?

50:19.515 --> 50:22.519
(insects chirping)

50:24.454 --> 50:26.156
- Yeah.

50:26.189 --> 50:29.192
(insects chirping)

50:32.261 --> 50:33.263
- Well then,

50:34.597 --> 50:36.199
what do we do now?

50:38.801 --> 50:42.372
- I don't think I have
it in me to move, so.

50:42.405 --> 50:45.409
(insects chirping)

50:49.412 --> 50:51.781
- Do you think a cheeky
fuck would be too noisy?

50:51.814 --> 50:55.785
- Yeah, let's just fuck right
in front of the hooded man.

50:55.818 --> 50:56.653
No, Mark.

50:56.686 --> 50:58.354
- Okay.

50:58.387 --> 50:59.556
It was a joke.

51:02.158 --> 51:02.826
What?

51:04.460 --> 51:05.762
- Stop thinking about it.

51:05.795 --> 51:08.498
(both laughing)

51:10.633 --> 51:13.637
(insects chirping)

53:01.644 --> 53:03.280
Do you think as we,

53:06.649 --> 53:09.853
do you think as we get closer to
death,

53:11.554 --> 53:14.691
I don't know, as we ride the
line, we,

53:15.758 --> 53:19.028
we start to see things on the
other side.

53:19.061 --> 53:20.530
- I think I'm still a little too
high

53:20.563 --> 53:23.300
to be talking about ghosts, but.

53:27.270 --> 53:29.773
- Not necessarily ghosts, just,

53:32.608 --> 53:37.680
I dunno, it's like getting your
feet wet on a sinking ship.

53:37.713 --> 53:41.284
- Look at this staunch atheist
now.

53:41.317 --> 53:43.620
- It's less about believing.

53:46.555 --> 53:48.591
It's like a feeling.

53:48.624 --> 53:50.860
(gentle music)

53:50.893 --> 53:53.529
(insects chirping)

53:53.562 --> 53:54.397
- No, I,

53:55.431 --> 53:56.633
I get it.

53:56.666 --> 53:57.834
(gentle music)

53:57.867 --> 54:00.503
(insects chirping)

54:00.536 --> 54:02.639
You know, when my mom died, I,

54:02.672 --> 54:04.808
I swear I kept seeing her,

54:07.843 --> 54:10.013
you know, her face,

54:10.046 --> 54:11.715
everywhere, I mean.

54:12.715 --> 54:14.584
When I closed my eyes,

54:15.451 --> 54:16.453
in the dark.

54:18.087 --> 54:21.557
You know, I don't know if it
was my brain dealing with death

54:21.590 --> 54:25.395
or it was just a part of
mourning or.

54:25.428 --> 54:27.730
- Mark, when you want something
so badly,

54:27.763 --> 54:28.598
your brain can just make it up.

54:28.631 --> 54:30.633
- I know but this,

54:30.666 --> 54:32.468
this felt stranger than that.

54:32.501 --> 54:34.370
(gentle music)

54:34.403 --> 54:36.539
I mean, it was so painful.

54:39.141 --> 54:43.646
You know, I started to try and
make myself forget her face.

54:43.679 --> 54:46.383
(gentle music)

54:47.616 --> 54:48.818
My own mother's.

54:48.851 --> 54:51.454
(gentle music)

54:51.487 --> 54:54.090
Just so I wouldn't feel
the dagger in my heart

54:54.123 --> 54:57.727
every time I realized
she wasn't really there.

54:57.760 --> 55:00.797
(gentle music)

55:00.830 --> 55:01.965
- Did it work?

55:03.933 --> 55:06.602
- I think it goes deeper than
memory.

55:06.635 --> 55:08.871
(gentle music)

55:08.904 --> 55:11.841
(insects chirping)

55:11.874 --> 55:13.710
(gentle music)

55:13.743 --> 55:16.879
- Like light from a dead star.

55:16.912 --> 55:17.847
- Yeah.

55:17.880 --> 55:20.550
(gentle music)

55:25.187 --> 55:28.124
(insects chirping)

55:35.464 --> 55:38.335
(birds chirping)

56:03.692 --> 56:06.429
(gentle music)

56:17.773 --> 56:19.042
- Just tell him.

56:22.912 --> 56:24.414
This is my fault.

56:28.551 --> 56:31.621
Mark, I came here because I love
you.

56:32.788 --> 56:34.724
(gentle music)

56:34.757 --> 56:37.226
(birds chirping)

56:37.259 --> 56:39.729
Mark, we are our own rivers.

56:41.497 --> 56:42.432
(birds chirping)

56:42.465 --> 56:43.533
(gentle music)

56:43.566 --> 56:45.701
I am my own vessel.

56:45.734 --> 56:48.638
(gentle music)

56:48.671 --> 56:50.173
I am my own vessel.

56:51.173 --> 56:52.942
(gentle music)

56:52.975 --> 56:55.111
(birds chirping)

56:55.144 --> 56:56.913
I am my own vessel.

56:56.946 --> 56:58.781
(gentle music)

56:58.814 --> 56:59.849
(Betty crying)

56:59.882 --> 57:01.884
(birds chirping)

57:01.917 --> 57:04.587
(gentle music)

57:05.988 --> 57:07.991
Ooh, I am my own vessel.

57:09.525 --> 57:11.995
(gentle music)

57:14.997 --> 57:17.133
I am my own vessel.

57:17.166 --> 57:20.236
(gentle music)

57:20.269 --> 57:21.938
I am my own vessel.

57:23.205 --> 57:25.908
(gentle music)

57:25.941 --> 57:28.744
(birds chirping)

57:28.777 --> 57:31.247
(gentle music)

57:31.280 --> 57:33.950
(birds chirping)

57:33.983 --> 57:36.619
(gentle music)

58:09.919 --> 58:12.922
(insects chirping)

58:20.095 --> 58:23.766
- Why didn't you wake
me for sunset, Betty?

58:26.035 --> 58:29.238
- It takes effort to sleep 12
hours.

58:29.271 --> 58:30.339
- What?

58:30.372 --> 58:34.911
- If you wanted to wake
for sunset, you would have.

58:36.011 --> 58:38.815
- Well, I wanted to and I
didn't.

58:40.182 --> 58:42.785
Nothing I haven't seen before.

58:48.891 --> 58:49.826
Not hungry?

58:50.993 --> 58:53.830
- Nothing I haven't tasted
before.

58:55.698 --> 58:58.835
- I'm sorry for getting antsy, I
just,

59:00.836 --> 59:04.140
just wanted this weekend to be
perfect.

59:04.173 --> 59:06.109
It's typical, isn't it?

59:07.309 --> 59:08.177
- What is?

59:09.411 --> 59:12.649
- Life, not going the way you
expect.

59:15.951 --> 59:18.387
- How did you want this weekend
to go?

59:18.420 --> 59:19.289
- I dunno.

59:21.156 --> 59:22.025
Better.

59:22.892 --> 59:26.862
I think my expectations were too
high.

59:26.895 --> 59:28.297
Too much pressure maybe.

59:28.330 --> 59:30.399
Maybe we should have just
buttoned the curtains,

59:30.432 --> 59:32.668
stayed in the bedroom the whole
time.

59:32.701 --> 59:33.570
- Maybe.

59:39.074 --> 59:40.577
Do you wish that,

59:44.346 --> 59:48.017
do you wish that we had more
time?

59:48.050 --> 59:48.918
- No.

59:50.185 --> 59:53.056
- We've had more than enough
time.

59:59.261 --> 01:00:00.296
Is there something wrong?

01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:03.232
I mean, besides you being
hangry and not eating,

01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:04.800
- I'm not hangry.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:06.903
- Yeah, I've heard that before.

01:00:08.904 --> 01:00:13.275
You don't think I've been going
crazy nervous over all this?

01:00:13.308 --> 01:00:17.179
I've been going as crazy
as you have all weekend.

01:00:17.212 --> 01:00:20.383
But now it's just time for us to
relax.

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.418
Savor what we have left.

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.754
Right, it might not be perfect

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:28.057
so just make the best of what
we've got.

01:00:32.027 --> 01:00:33.896
- I don't want to die.

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.733
- Unfortunately, you
don't have a choice in it.

01:00:37.766 --> 01:00:40.369
- I have a choice in time.
- This is your choice in time.

01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:41.236
- Yes.
- This weekend

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.672
is the only time you'll get a
choice.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.707
- Yes, and it's my choice.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.075
- And you made it.

01:00:46.108 --> 01:00:48.377
When you came here, you made it.

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:51.080
The decision was final when
you walked through that door.

01:00:51.113 --> 01:00:53.249
- It is my decision, Mark.

01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:02.858
- Do you think those
machines that keep you alive

01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:06.829
will give you a second chance to
end it?

01:01:06.862 --> 01:01:09.432
What about the doctors, nurses,

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:13.769
I mean, you think they'll
give you a second chance?

01:01:13.802 --> 01:01:17.239
Surely when you are rotting
from the inside out,

01:01:17.272 --> 01:01:20.943
surely when you're begging to
die,

01:01:20.976 --> 01:01:24.313
I mean, you think they'll show
you mercy?

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:26.416
- No, they fucking won't.

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:37.093
(Betty crying)

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.128
You can't run from this.

01:01:42.297 --> 01:01:43.366
No you can't.

01:01:49.571 --> 01:01:52.308
(door slamming)

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:06.322
(door banging)

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:07.456
- [Mark] Betty,

01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:09.825
Betty, what have you done with
'em?

01:02:09.858 --> 01:02:11.761
Betty, let me in.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.929
- Not until you calm down.

01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:15.765
- [Mark] I don't sound calm.

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:16.499
- No.

01:02:17.499 --> 01:02:18.567
- [Mark] Well, maybe it's
because

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.971
you're trying to ruin my life.

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.539
- You are being dramatic.

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:25.040
- Dramatic?

01:02:25.073 --> 01:02:27.276
You talked about choice before.

01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:31.247
You're taking away my
choice, my choice, Betty.

01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:34.050
Open the door.

01:02:35.117 --> 01:02:38.454
Open the door or I'll break it
down.

01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:39.989
Please, please I,

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.227
I don't wanna live,

01:02:45.327 --> 01:02:46.996
not without you, I,

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.833
I don't wanna be alone again.

01:02:50.866 --> 01:02:52.434
I don't want you to be alone.

01:02:52.467 --> 01:02:53.668
(gentle music)

01:02:53.702 --> 01:02:58.207
I can't stand it, the thought
of you somewhere else alone.

01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.977
- There's nowhere else.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.580
(gentle music)

01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:10.486
I am not gonna be used as your
excuse.

01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:11.821
(gentle music)

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:14.924
My fucking cancer is not your
excuse.

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:18.161
- An excuse?

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.630
Yeah.

01:03:21.663 --> 01:03:22.498
You know what?

01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:24.133
I need an excuse okay,

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:28.137
because I can't live outside our
bubble.

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:30.272
Every second out there with
those,

01:03:30.305 --> 01:03:32.842
those fake fucking drones,

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.244
being another fake fucking drone

01:03:35.277 --> 01:03:39.582
and listening to myself talk
like a fake fucking drone.

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:42.952
(gentle music)

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.253
It's unbearable.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.524
(gentle music)

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.562
- It's like I'm in a cage and
it's,

01:03:53.595 --> 01:03:55.364
it's growing smaller and
smaller.

01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:58.100
And if I escaped, I'd tear the
limbs

01:03:58.133 --> 01:04:01.670
of every snide-face
phony out there, I would.

01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:02.671
(gentle music)

01:04:02.704 --> 01:04:05.307
I'd tear it all fucking down.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.077
(gentle music)

01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:11.881
I couldn't even breathe.

01:04:12.614 --> 01:04:13.616
It's toxic.

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.152
The exhausts, the perfume,

01:04:17.185 --> 01:04:20.122
artificial to the fucking
molecule.

01:04:21.523 --> 01:04:23.292
I despise that world.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.562
I hate it.

01:04:26.595 --> 01:04:29.498
(gentle music)

01:04:29.531 --> 01:04:31.267
I hate myself.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.036
(gentle music)

01:04:39.374 --> 01:04:42.578
And then I look up and the sky
is blue.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:51.287
I thought the world is getting
smaller.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.225
It stays so vast.

01:05:00.395 --> 01:05:02.031
So vast.

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:04.634
(gentle music)

01:05:35.697 --> 01:05:36.966
Mark?

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.106
Mark?

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.319
Mark?

01:06:02.324 --> 01:06:03.426
Mark?

01:06:09.164 --> 01:06:09.865
Give them to me.

01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:11.700
I said give them to me.
- Here.

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:21.543
[inaudible muttering]

01:06:21.576 --> 01:06:24.313
I emptied them this morning.

01:06:24.346 --> 01:06:27.016
(gentle music)

01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:38.694

01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:36.285
(Betty moaning)

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.252
No.

01:07:37.285 --> 01:07:40.456
(Betty crying)

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.091
Mark, stop please.

01:07:43.525 --> 01:07:44.860
Mark, stop, stop.

01:07:47.562 --> 01:07:48.631
- Fuck, fuck.

01:07:49.798 --> 01:07:50.632
- Stop.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.402
- This could have been easier,
Betty.

01:07:53.435 --> 01:07:55.337
This could have been so much
easier.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.205
- Please.

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.173
(gentle music)

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.342
- I won't let you make this
mistake, okay.

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:01.243
Betty.

01:08:02.444 --> 01:08:03.679
- I said fucking stop.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.380
- What are you gonna do with
that?

01:08:05.413 --> 01:08:06.615
- Listen to me, Mark.

01:08:06.648 --> 01:08:07.482
- [Mark] Are you gonna kill me?

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.218
- I shouldn't have indulged in
this.

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.253
- It's too late.
- You are sick.

01:08:11.286 --> 01:08:13.388
You are sick and I made you
worse.

01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:15.190
- Once we walked through those
days,

01:08:15.223 --> 01:08:16.825
it's too late.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:19.328
I'm sorry.
- I have to do this.

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:20.162
- I'm sorry.

01:08:20.195 --> 01:08:20.896
Don't.

I'm okay.

01:10:29.624 --> 01:10:31.026
I'm okay.

(both crying)

01:10:34.362 --> 01:10:36.699
- I thought I felt your heart

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.935
with my hands.

01:10:39.968 --> 01:10:42.538
(both crying)

01:10:47.575 --> 01:10:48.444

01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:50.846
- Okay.

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:51.713
Okay.

01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:34.089
- [Mark Voiceover] Should we?

01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:36.024

(car engine revving)

01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:35.978
- Nothing can be perfect.

01:13:37.879 --> 01:13:39.047
I guess.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.151
(car engine revving)

01:13:43.985 --> 01:13:46.922
- [Betty Voiceover] No, it
can't.

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:50.459
No perfect end to the imperfect
mind,

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.995
imperfect body, imperfect life.

01:13:55.296 --> 01:13:56.465
Makes sense.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:03.739
The heart to the arteries,
to capillaries to the brain,

01:14:05.273 --> 01:14:08.977
to the soul, to veins
and back to the heart.

01:14:11.312 --> 01:14:15.551
To arteries, to the
capillaries, to the lungs to.
