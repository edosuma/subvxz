00:04.290 --> 00:05.210
Jonah:
Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.210 --> 00:06.330
I made something for you.

00:06.330 --> 00:08.620
These are incredible.

00:08.620 --> 00:10.830
Too bad I can't wear them
outside this room.

00:10.830 --> 00:13.620
-Why not?
-I don't wanna take the chance
that Jonah would see them.

00:13.620 --> 00:14.920
Like your sneaks.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.170
They were a gift,
from a friend.

00:17.170 --> 00:18.290
I know who the friend is.

00:18.290 --> 00:20.380
Andi:
These are family heirlooms.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.620
My mom saved them
from when I was born.

00:22.620 --> 00:25.080
And now, I'm making them
into a bracelet for her.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.790
And I'm going to give it
to her in this box.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.540
This is off limits.

00:29.540 --> 00:30.830
I'm gonna put this up here.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.420
-Hello!
-Mommy!

00:33.420 --> 00:34.920
Andi:
Bye, Morgan!

00:34.920 --> 00:37.120
She took it!
She took my box!

00:37.120 --> 00:41.250
Morgan doesn't seem like
the kind of kid who would
steal somethin'.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.880
Which means,
you don't believe me.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.580
Is this it?

00:44.580 --> 00:46.460
Now, is there something
you wanna say to Morgan?

00:46.460 --> 00:47.330
Sorry.

00:47.330 --> 00:50.380
I know that
she took this box.

00:50.380 --> 00:53.290
I just wish
that Bowie believed me.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.420
Because of recent events,
these rules must now
be followed

01:00.420 --> 01:02.120
when borrowing
each other's clothes.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.500
Rule one:
Ask before taking something.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.500
Rule two:
All items must be
cleaned and returned

01:09.500 --> 01:11.500
in the same condition
they were taken.

01:11.500 --> 01:17.380
And, rule number three:
All items may be borrowed
for three days, max.

01:17.380 --> 01:20.500
-Any questions?
-Just my original question:

01:20.500 --> 01:23.500
Where is
my fuzzy blue cardigan?

01:23.500 --> 01:26.580
Hopefully, in the cineplex
lost and found.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.960
I'm waiting
for a call back.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.290
Perfect!

01:30.290 --> 01:32.540
Which is why
we need the rules!

02:40.750 --> 02:42.120

It's usually on if my mom's

Hi.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.960
Hi.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.000
Ready to go?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.790
Almost.
Give me a few minutes?

03:08.790 --> 03:09.960
Okay.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.330
Oh, uh...
I brought you a surprise.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.710
Come on out, surprise!

03:14.710 --> 03:15.620
Surprise!

03:15.620 --> 03:18.670
-Morgan!
-She begged me to come.

03:18.670 --> 03:21.540
Well, I just she
doesn't mind me stealing
some of her French fries!

03:21.540 --> 03:23.580
You better stay away
from my fries.

03:23.580 --> 03:24.620
Never!

03:24.620 --> 03:26.170
(Miranda laughs)

03:26.170 --> 03:28.330
Just let me finish up
here, and then we'll go
have lunch, okay?

03:28.330 --> 03:29.420
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:38.670 --> 03:40.710
-I'm bored.
-Do you wanna draw?

03:40.710 --> 03:42.540
I brought your pencils.

03:42.540 --> 03:43.620
No.

03:43.620 --> 03:47.210
Do you wanna play,
"I Spy with My Little Eye"?

03:47.210 --> 03:48.540
I'm not five.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.460
Morgan... let me
show you something.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.460
These are music boxes.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.580
Here's how they work.

04:01.580 --> 04:05.960
(music plays)

04:05.960 --> 04:08.040
(Miranda laughs)

04:08.040 --> 04:10.420
Pretty cool, right?

04:10.420 --> 04:11.920
Here you go, you try.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.380
(music plays)

04:14.380 --> 04:16.380
-I like it!
-Yeah?

04:17.580 --> 04:19.670
Each one of these
plays a different song.

04:19.670 --> 04:21.710
You can play with these
until I'm ready to go.

04:21.710 --> 04:23.670
Mm-hm. Okay.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.670
Has anyone ever told you
you're perfect?

04:27.040 --> 04:32.500
(laughs)
Um, actually... yeah.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
(Bowie and Miranda laugh)

04:43.250 --> 04:48.380
-Hi.
-If you're here to horrify me,
you've already done that today.

04:48.380 --> 04:53.460
That's exactly why I'm here,
to apologize for horrifying you.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.380
As the child of four therapists,
I feel personally responsible

04:56.380 --> 04:59.830
for handling the situation
in the most professional
manner possible...

05:01.790 --> 05:03.830
which I didn't do earlier.

05:03.830 --> 05:07.210
And I am really, really sorry
about that.

05:07.210 --> 05:09.790
I want you to know
that I won't tell anyone
that I saw you

05:09.790 --> 05:11.120
or that you're in therapy.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.790
-Apology accepted.
-Great!

05:19.790 --> 05:24.290
Uh, well, um, looking forward
to disliking each other
the normal amount, then.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.250
Does therapy help?

05:32.330 --> 05:34.080
I think so.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.670
And my mom
is a really good therapist.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.750
I'm sure she is.
It's just...

05:39.750 --> 05:42.170
I don't feel comfortable
talking to adults.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.330
I get that.
They can be
really annoying sometimes,

05:44.330 --> 05:46.750
with their "experience"
and "wisdom."

05:46.750 --> 05:49.830
(laughs)
Okay, old people, we get it,

05:49.830 --> 05:52.000
but maybe we can't learn
from your stuff.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.380
-Maybe we have different stuff.
-Not everything happened to you.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.420
(laughs)

05:58.580 --> 06:00.710
I like talking to you
better than your mom.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.540
Thanks.
I like talking to you
better than your mom.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.710
-Huh?
-That was awkward.

06:07.710 --> 06:10.460
I don't think we've ever
really talked before.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.830
I mean, I've had
some conversations with you
in my head.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.710
About what?

06:14.710 --> 06:18.710
So, if you don't like talking
to adults, why are you
in therapy?

06:20.710 --> 06:25.120
It was my parents' idea.
They're worried about me.

06:25.120 --> 06:31.040
With everything going on
at home, they want me to...
express my feelings.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.670
That can be hard.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.170
It's just...
some of my feelings
are kinda dark.

06:39.170 --> 06:41.920
Everybody's messed up.
We all have dark stuff.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.830
Yeah, but my stuff
is super dark.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.960
I think that, too sometimes.
But I find that, if I say it
out loud,

06:48.960 --> 06:50.460
it doesn't seem so bad.

06:50.460 --> 06:51.830
You really think that's true?

06:51.830 --> 06:52.880
Absolutely.

06:56.750 --> 07:01.080
I spit on the hamburgers.
And then I like to watch people
eat them.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.120
You're trying to remember
if you've ever had a hamburger
from here, aren't you?

07:08.120 --> 07:09.920
Uh-huh.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.500
Now do you think I'm messed up?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.830
No.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.500
Are you going to tell anyone
I'm messed up?

07:16.500 --> 07:17.620
No.

07:17.620 --> 07:18.880
You better not.

07:20.170 --> 07:24.250
I'm trusting you
with my deep, dark secret.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.790
That's... quite an honor.

07:26.790 --> 07:29.710
Yes... it is.

07:32.330 --> 07:35.120
(rock music plays)

07:41.790 --> 07:44.790
I love this art festival.

07:44.790 --> 07:47.710
It's like
the world's biggest AndiShack.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.920
Wouldn't this be perfect
to hang in the salon?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.500
Ugh... no.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.960
It most certainly
would not.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.750
Come on!
This doesn't say
"Cloud Ten" to you?

07:57.750 --> 08:01.790
No... it says,
"Don't buy me, I'm ugly."

08:01.790 --> 08:03.830
Then you pick something.

08:05.290 --> 08:06.750
How about this?

08:08.960 --> 08:11.210
That's actually beautiful.

08:11.210 --> 08:13.670
-Mm-hm.
-The imagery transports you,

08:13.670 --> 08:15.880
right into a podiatrist's
waiting room.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.040
(scoffs)

08:17.040 --> 08:18.920
Andi?
Andi, can you come here
a second?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.170
Yeah.

08:20.170 --> 08:22.170
Which one do you like better?

08:22.170 --> 08:24.120
Uh-uh.
No way.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.380
Leave me out of this.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.790
But we trust your opinion.

08:26.790 --> 08:30.830
Well, my opinion is that
you find a piece of art
you both like.

08:30.830 --> 08:33.540
Well, there's nothing good
hanging in the house.

08:33.540 --> 08:34.830
What?

08:34.830 --> 08:38.000
Okay. You guys are
at an art festival.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.960
A literal festival of art.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.170
Thousands of things
to choose from.

08:43.170 --> 08:44.830
Just pick some art.

08:44.830 --> 08:46.790
Any art!

08:46.790 --> 08:50.830
That painting...
or that photograph.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.920
Or that--

08:52.920 --> 08:54.580
charcoal drawing.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.580
-(Miranda laughs)
-All right... finished!

09:05.580 --> 09:06.790
Let's have lunch.

09:06.790 --> 09:07.920
Okay, great.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.830
Morgan, can you put away
the music boxes?

09:09.830 --> 09:10.880
Okay.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.250
Is that all the music boxes?

09:14.250 --> 09:15.920
Yes.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.170
Huh.
Thought there were five.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.960
Hey, it doesn't matter.
Let's go.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.250
-(music box plays)
-Uh-- Morgan?

09:26.250 --> 09:28.460
Is there something
in your pocket?

09:40.420 --> 09:42.000
I didn't know it was there.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.040
That's okay, uh...
nobody's mad, right?

09:47.750 --> 09:48.750
Right.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.210
Just put it back.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.250
You okay?

09:59.250 --> 10:01.460
You're not gonna say
anything else to her?

10:01.460 --> 10:03.420
She put it back.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.460
Is there anything else
you want me to say?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.880
I mean, it's your call.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.920
Thanks, for saying that.

10:13.170 --> 10:15.880
Okay. Let's eat! (laughs)

10:24.210 --> 10:28.290
Who is... Walker Brodsky?

10:28.290 --> 10:31.500
The caricature artist,
from Cyrus' bar mitzvah.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.880
Did you know about this?

10:33.880 --> 10:36.250
I... knew he drew it.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.000
But I didn't know
it would be here.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
On display, winning awards!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Why didn't he tell you?

10:42.000 --> 10:45.920
I wanted to...
but... someone thought
it would be better

10:45.920 --> 10:47.290
if we didn't talk anymore.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.000
Of course you'd be here.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.830
Of course, you'd be here.
(laughs)

10:51.830 --> 10:53.210
Nice to see you again, Ms. Mack.

10:53.210 --> 10:54.790
Oh, please, call me Bex.

10:54.790 --> 10:58.290
Ms. Mack is my mother...
who happens to be right here.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.170
Oh, then, let me
try this again.

11:00.170 --> 11:03.120
-Nice to meet you, Ms. Mack.
-Oh, please, call me Celia.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.080
Ms. Mack is
my mother-in-law.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.750
When do I get to meet her?

11:06.750 --> 11:07.830
She's dead.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.790
Well, she is.

11:10.790 --> 11:12.000
(scoffs)

11:12.000 --> 11:16.580
Uh, my face?
First place? You can't
shoot a girl a text?

11:16.580 --> 11:19.000
Well, I was respecting
your wishes.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.250
Oh, well, respect my wishes
if a drawing of my face
comes in second place.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.540
If a drawing of my face
comes in first place,
all bets are off.

11:26.540 --> 11:29.170
(laughs)
It's really good to see you.

11:34.620 --> 11:37.170
Miranda:
You were very quiet at lunch.
What's going on?

11:37.170 --> 11:38.500
Oh...

11:40.290 --> 11:43.210
Oh-- Morgie...
here's my phone.

11:43.210 --> 11:46.170
Why don't you
sit over there
and play your game?

11:46.170 --> 11:47.000
Okay.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.290
(clears throat)
I just thought... you might've
said somethin' more to her.

11:56.920 --> 12:01.420
Ohhh, so earlier,
when you said it was my call
on how to handle this,

12:01.420 --> 12:03.080
you didn't really mean it.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.880
Except you didn't
handle it.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.540
Is it really
that big of a deal?

12:08.540 --> 12:09.880
Yeah, I think it is.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.420
She's seven.
It's the kinda stuff
kids do.

12:13.420 --> 12:17.040
Mmm...
has she done this before?

12:19.250 --> 12:21.120
Why would you ask that?

12:21.120 --> 12:23.670
Because of what happened
at AndiShack.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.040
(sighs)

12:31.710 --> 12:33.710
So Morgan did steal
the prayer box.

12:33.710 --> 12:36.040
I kinda thought
we were past this.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.080
And you knew she stole it?

12:38.080 --> 12:41.830
I was hoping
that Andi and Morgan
would become friends.

12:41.830 --> 12:44.920
It's important
that they like each other
because we like each other.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.000
And you asked Andi
to apologize to Morgan.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.080
I'm sorry.

12:54.210 --> 12:55.960
Now are we past this?

12:55.960 --> 12:59.080
Wait. How did the box
get back into AndiShack?

12:59.080 --> 13:00.750
I guess not. (sighs)

13:02.080 --> 13:03.210
You put it there!

13:03.210 --> 13:05.710
Maybe it wasn't
the best decision.

13:05.710 --> 13:08.710
It was a horrible decision!

13:08.710 --> 13:10.620
You made it look like
it was all Andi's fault!

13:10.620 --> 13:11.710
That's not
what I wanted to do.

13:11.710 --> 13:13.750
You made me doubt
my own daughter.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.790
And even worse...
you made Andi doubt herself.

13:18.790 --> 13:22.080
Morgan still has
a lot to learn,
which she will.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.000
I guess I have a lot
to learn, too.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.080
Knowing when
I can trust someone.

13:27.080 --> 13:31.210
(laughs)
There's no such thing
as trusting a seven-year-old.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.000
I'm talking about you.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.880
Morgan, let's go,
we're leaving.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.250
Bye.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.420
Bye, Morgan.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.120
(sighs)

13:51.460 --> 13:54.500
Andi, hey--
I wanna get a picture
with the picture.

13:57.540 --> 14:01.540
Okay, say
Leonard Da Vin-cheese!
(chuckles)

14:04.420 --> 14:07.460
I thought it would get
a better reaction.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.500
Oh, hey, that's my granddaughter
in that drawing.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.920
We won first place!

14:12.290 --> 14:14.420
-(camera clicks)
-Okay, different pose.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.250
Something where it looks like
you know each other.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.290
Hey, isn't that Bar Mitzvah Boy
and Phoenix Girl?

14:23.290 --> 14:24.920
Yeah, that's Buffy and Cyrus.

14:29.830 --> 14:32.000
And my boyfriend, Jonah.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.080
(camera clicks)

14:43.960 --> 14:46.210
So glad I captured that moment.

14:46.210 --> 14:47.670
What should we do?

14:47.670 --> 14:51.000
We should... check out
the primitive folk art.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.250
Mm-hm.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.960
I wasn't sure if you guys
were showing up.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.000
Cyrus made friends
with an artist,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.540
who sold him... that.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.540
-(Jonah/Walker laugh)
-Yikes.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.620
I mean... nice.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.670
I'm an easy mark.

15:13.670 --> 15:16.040
That's a great picture
of you.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.920
-Allow me to explain
what happened--
-Not necessary,

15:18.920 --> 15:21.330
I think it's pretty obvious
what's goin' on here.

15:23.420 --> 15:24.880
You're the artist.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.040
That's right.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.500
Congratulations
on winning first place.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.330
-Thanks, man.
-I'm Jonah, by the way.

15:29.330 --> 15:30.790
I'm Walker.
Nice to finally meet you.

15:30.790 --> 15:32.790
Jonah:
You, too.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.080
Can I buy that?

15:34.080 --> 15:35.790
It's not for sale.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.920
I figured,
but I had to try, right?

15:39.920 --> 15:41.330
Wanna show me around?

15:41.330 --> 15:43.880
Let's go.
I haven't seen anything yet.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.250
We'll catch up
with you guys later.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.080
Right.
Sounds good.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.250
Bye, Andi.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.330
Bye!

15:52.830 --> 15:55.620
Hey, shouldn't you
be in Phoenix?

15:55.620 --> 15:58.880
Uh, yeah.
That didn't really work out.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.500
Your friends must be happy.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.170
We're ecstatic.

16:05.330 --> 16:08.460
Anyways, uh, it's good
to see you again.

16:09.540 --> 16:10.710
You, too.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.420
What was that?

16:14.420 --> 16:15.580
What was what?

16:15.580 --> 16:17.920
This, with the hair.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.080
What about it?

16:19.080 --> 16:20.290
You never do that.

16:20.290 --> 16:22.380
I play with my hair
all the time.

16:22.380 --> 16:23.710
Never!

16:23.710 --> 16:26.000
Which can
only mean one thing:

16:26.000 --> 16:28.250
Your crush is on Walker.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.500
Cyrus, please.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.250
-You have a tell.
-A what?

16:31.250 --> 16:33.540
A tell.
It's an unconscious thing you do

16:33.540 --> 16:34.830
when you're trying
to hide something.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.620
Like who you have
a crush on.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.670
I'm not trying
to hide anything.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.420
I'm just not telling you.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.080
There's a difference.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.210
What is it?

16:44.210 --> 16:45.710
Like I said the other day--

16:45.710 --> 16:48.210
It's interesting you bring up
the other day.

16:48.210 --> 16:52.040
Because then,
your hostile silence confirmed
that your crush was Jonah.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.460
But now, your stubborn refusal
to acknowledge your tell,

16:55.460 --> 16:57.710
points to Walker.

16:57.710 --> 17:03.170
Here's the tell for
"This conversation is over."

17:03.170 --> 17:05.830
It's not a tell if you tell me.

17:11.420 --> 17:12.920
What?

17:12.920 --> 17:16.880
You know, I was really nervous
about you meeting Walker.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.420
But...
you were so cool.

17:20.420 --> 17:23.330
You can be friends
with anyone.

17:23.330 --> 17:24.880
How is that even possible?

17:26.420 --> 17:28.290
Because I'm the one
wearing this.

17:28.290 --> 17:31.540
-♪ It doesn't get better
than this ♪
-(laughs)

17:31.540 --> 17:34.460
-(both laugh)
-♪ It doesn't get better
than this ♪

17:34.460 --> 17:37.120
♪ And I know,
no matter where I go ♪

17:37.120 --> 17:40.380
♪ I can shine this light,
I can let it show ♪

17:40.380 --> 17:44.500
-♪ It doesn't get better ♪
-You guys look
adorable together.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.620
No, we don't.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.500
Yes, we do.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.380
Just admit it...

17:49.380 --> 17:50.620
you're happy.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.170
Yeah.

17:52.170 --> 17:54.830
-I guess we are.
-(both laugh)

17:54.830 --> 17:56.830
Just don't overdo it
and make it gross.

17:58.420 --> 17:59.540
(both laugh)

17:59.540 --> 18:01.460
Hey.
Have we ordered?

18:01.460 --> 18:05.210
Yeah.
Got you a milkshake
and some baby taters.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.380
-Great. Who's our--
-Hi, Cyrus.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.460
Amber.
(clears throat) Yay.

18:10.460 --> 18:14.040
Large baby taters
for the happy couple.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.670
Small baby taters for Cyrus.

18:16.670 --> 18:19.500
And a burger for Buffy.

18:21.420 --> 18:23.120
You ordered a burger?

18:23.120 --> 18:24.750
With extra pickles.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.080
Bon appetit!

18:28.580 --> 18:30.500
You know what?
That doesn't look
cooked enough.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.710
Here, let me take it back.

18:31.710 --> 18:32.750
Ow!

18:32.750 --> 18:35.080
It's fine.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.330
Uh-- I guess it looks okay.

18:38.330 --> 18:40.830
In fact, it looks really okay.

18:40.830 --> 18:42.540
I wish I had ordered a burger.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.460
Do you wanna trade?

18:44.460 --> 18:45.500
No.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.500
I'll-- I'll throw in
my milkshake.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.540
And a foot rub!

18:50.540 --> 18:54.080
No! And stay away
from my feet.

18:54.080 --> 18:58.290
(dramatic music playing)

19:38.380 --> 19:40.250
Noooooo!

19:41.420 --> 19:42.540
(plops)

19:44.380 --> 19:45.580
What's wrong with you?

19:45.580 --> 19:48.580
I'm so sorry!
I don't know what happened.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.000
I'll go order you
another one.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.670
(whispers)
I couldn't let my friend
eat a spitburger!

19:58.790 --> 20:00.620
And I didn't reveal
your secret.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.080
I know.
You passed the test.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.620
What test?

20:06.620 --> 20:08.540
I wanted to see
if you'd keep my secret.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.920
And you did.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.620
Now I can tell you
the truth.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.830
Y-- You lost me somewhere.

20:13.830 --> 20:17.380
Cyrus, I don't spit
in people's hamburgers.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.380
Ohh!

20:19.380 --> 20:22.420
Oh!
Oh, thank goodness!

20:22.420 --> 20:24.540
Did you really think
I was capable of something

20:24.540 --> 20:25.750
so mean and disgusting?

20:25.750 --> 20:28.620
Yes, like absolutely capable.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.620
Your mom said I had to find
people I can trust.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.620
She says I need
to open up more.

20:33.620 --> 20:35.920
As in... to me?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.750
Apparently, I'm very bottled up.

20:37.750 --> 20:43.040
Huh. Well, um,
Wednesday afternoons
work for me.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.960
Actually, any afternoon.
I don't think they'll miss me
in Spanish Club.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.250
Morgan stole a music box?

20:53.250 --> 20:54.790
-Yeah.
-What did Miranda say?

20:54.790 --> 20:59.120
She said...
it's the kinda stuff
that kids do.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.120
-(gasps) No!
-She did not say that!

21:02.120 --> 21:05.000
Oh, please stop,
this story is too awful.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.380
Then what happened?

21:06.380 --> 21:10.380
I got her to admit
that... Morgan took
Andi's bracelet.

21:10.380 --> 21:12.790
I knew it!

21:12.790 --> 21:15.380
Miranda stood there
with that fake smile.

21:15.380 --> 21:18.330
(mimicking)
"Oh, Andi, is there something
you wanna say to Morgan?"

21:18.330 --> 21:21.250
(mimicking)
"Oh, Andi, could you please
apologize to Morgie?"

21:22.580 --> 21:27.040
Hey, but you found the bracelet
in AndiShack.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.790
How is that even possible?

21:28.790 --> 21:32.120
Yeah, Morgan was standing
outside with you the whole time.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.000
Both:
Miranda!

21:36.000 --> 21:39.620
(gasps)
They're like a mother-daughter
crime team!

21:39.620 --> 21:44.330
Look, I-- I am so, so sorry
that I put you through that.

21:44.330 --> 21:47.670
I really thought
for a minute there
I was losing my mind.

21:47.670 --> 21:50.750
I-- I know,
I-- I feel horrible.

21:50.750 --> 21:53.750
I can't believe
I ever doubted you,
even for a second.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.620
I'm such an idiot.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.880
No. Stop.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.540
It's over now.

21:59.540 --> 22:02.790
You know what we should be?
A mother-daughter
crime-fighting team.

22:02.790 --> 22:08.540
-Ooh, making Shadyside
less shady, one block at a time.
-(Bex laughs)

22:08.540 --> 22:10.620
So, um... you and Miranda?

22:10.620 --> 22:11.830
Oh, that's over, too.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.290
Oh, really?

22:13.290 --> 22:15.880
She's outta my life forever.

22:20.290 --> 22:23.210
Oh, and I found
a fuzzy blue cardigan
in my car.

22:23.210 --> 22:25.540
Both:
Yay!

22:25.540 --> 22:27.790
(both shouting)

22:27.790 --> 22:32.620
(chattering indistinctly)

22:38.710 --> 22:39.960
Andi:
Next, on Andi Mack...

22:39.960 --> 22:45.460
Your lunch is served,
Cyrus and... you.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.380
Why do you have this need
to be friendly with...

22:48.380 --> 22:49.670
unfriendly people?

22:49.670 --> 22:51.120
You know, from Amber's
point of view,

22:51.120 --> 22:52.460
you're the unfriendly one.

22:52.460 --> 22:53.500
Are we playing that game

22:53.500 --> 22:54.580
we used to play?

22:54.580 --> 22:57.880
In this version...
there's a twist.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.670
Jonah's taking me

22:58.670 --> 23:00.250
to the trampoline park tomorrow.

23:00.250 --> 23:01.790
Will this be your first
real date?

23:03.710 --> 23:05.670
You're really the coolest girl
I've ever known.

23:05.670 --> 23:09.040
I was thinking, Adrenaline City
next weekend?

23:09.040 --> 23:10.880
I can't next weekend.

23:10.880 --> 23:11.960
The weekend after that?

23:11.960 --> 23:16.710
-Andi--
-Oh, no. I was having
so much fun.

23:16.710 --> 23:17.790
(two drumbeats)

23:17.790 --> 23:18.790
-(boing)
-(thud)
