Give it.

Where is it?

you will be old enough to shave.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.341

-Oh... yeah, okay.

That's Jessica, our neighbor.

Mom and Dad are letting her
sleep on our couch

01:25.563 --> 01:27.043
for a week until
her father's arraigned.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.523
Seems he got drunk
Friday night,

01:28.610 --> 01:30.090
decided to track down
her mom,

01:30.177 --> 01:32.788
and tried to drive
a street-sweeper to Mexico.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.964

Malcolm, Reese,

What are you doing?

01:41.362 --> 01:42.928
Are you kidding?

No way I'm letting Jessica
get a look at the goods.

What is taking
you boys so long?

Tell Sasquatch in there to give
us a shot at the bathroom.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.588
Hey, Mom, can I borrow
your car tonight?

01:50.675 --> 01:52.155
Frank Miller's signing
his new graphic novel...

01:52.242 --> 01:54.114
You're going to drive it the way
you threw your pants

01:54.201 --> 01:55.419
in a wad behind the hamper
yesterday?

01:55.506 --> 01:57.508
I don't think so.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.031
What?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.599
How does her mind even
form thoughts like that?

02:01.686 --> 02:04.080
[ Hal whistling]

02:05.299 --> 02:06.561
Is that a bee?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.606
That is how you know
it's fresh.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.869
You won't find any bees
in your store-bought honey,

02:10.955 --> 02:12.175
I'll tell you that much.

02:12.262 --> 02:13.263
Where did this come from?

02:13.350 --> 02:15.047
Spoils of war, Dewey.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.614
You know that beehive in
the toolshed

02:16.701 --> 02:18.268
I've been
battling for months?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.488
Victory is mine.

02:20.575 --> 02:21.619
You did it yourself?

02:21.706 --> 02:23.360
How'd you know how to do that?

02:23.447 --> 02:24.492
It's instinctual.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.015
See, human beings were born

02:26.102 --> 02:29.061
with everything they need
to destroy bees.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.977
Except the poison.
You have to buy that.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.936
I feel kind of sorry
for the bees, though.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.938
It's survival
of the fittest, Dewey.

02:36.025 --> 02:40.377
If they had won, they'd be
spreading us on toast right now.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.987
Big deal.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.903
So I don't get the car
to go to the book signing.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.558
Meeting your heroes is always
such a disappointment anyway.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.740
Hi, Malcolm.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.351
You got the car?

02:57.438 --> 02:59.266
How'd you get the car?

02:59.353 --> 03:00.832
I just had a little
shopping to do,

03:00.919 --> 03:02.443
and your mom insisted
I take the car.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.966
What do you mean,
she insisted?

03:04.053 --> 03:05.141
I've been begging
her for weeks.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.447
Every time I ask,
she says no.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.100
That's where you
made your mistake.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.711
I just got all vulnerable

03:09.798 --> 03:10.886
and poured on stuff
about my dad.

03:10.973 --> 03:11.974
It was easy.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.062
No way.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.108
Look, Malcolm,
it's not something

03:16.196 --> 03:17.806
I'm proud of, believe me.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.852
It's how I've learned to survive
in my twisted family.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.811
They're like a total cesspool
of manipulation

03:22.898 --> 03:24.769
and emotional blackmail.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.728
Everyone screwing
everyone over.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.818
I don't even know a true,
honest way

03:29.905 --> 03:31.559
to connect with people anymore.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.777
It's sick.

03:32.864 --> 03:35.389
[ sobbing]:
I'm sick!

03:35.476 --> 03:37.173
Jessica, wait.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.349
I'm sorry.

03:39.436 --> 03:42.570
Aw! Thanks for carrying
my bags for me, Malcolm.

03:43.484 --> 03:44.920
Told you it was easy.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.100
You can bite my American ass,
Zhao Lee.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.493
What's that?

03:52.580 --> 03:54.364
The school made us adopt
pen pals

03:54.451 --> 03:55.757
from different countries.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.280
I got stuck with
this loser from China.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.586
What's wrong
with China?

03:58.673 --> 03:59.804
It's not what
you think, Dewey.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.545
He won't send you
illegal fireworks

04:01.632 --> 04:03.634
or get your nunchakus
autographed by the emperor.

04:03.721 --> 04:04.896
The guy's a total jerk.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.942
It started off
with a simple request to

04:07.029 --> 04:09.379
apologize for Pearl Harbor.
The guy wouldn't do it.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.208
He's so arrogant! When I
draw squiggles, it's nonsense.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.992
When he does it,
it's a language.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.342
I was so pissed.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.474
Then I thought,
be the better man,

04:17.560 --> 04:18.779
and reason with the guy.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.476
"Do you want me
to kick your butt?

04:20.564 --> 04:23.175
Check yes or no."

04:23.263 --> 04:24.699
And there's his response.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.527
He couldn't even follow
simple instructions.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.093
"You need help, Reese."

04:28.180 --> 04:29.530
He thinks a whole planet
between us

04:29.617 --> 04:30.661
is going to protect him.

04:30.748 --> 04:31.706
He thinks he's so smart.

04:31.793 --> 04:32.837
We'll see who's smart

04:32.924 --> 04:34.056
when I mail myself
to China

04:34.143 --> 04:35.579
and kick his upside-down ass.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.625
What?
Reese, that's crazy.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.496
Name one thing that's crazy
about it.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.804
You're right.
I take it back.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.196
I can't wait
to see his face

04:44.284 --> 04:45.894
when he opens up his mail
and I pop out.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.374
Uh-huh.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.984
And how are you
supposed to get back

04:49.071 --> 04:50.507
after you beat him up?

04:50.594 --> 04:52.988
Dewey, you know nothing
about Asian culture.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.251
After I humiliate him,
I earn his respect,

04:55.338 --> 04:57.340
plus half his land
and his sister,

04:57.427 --> 04:58.820
if she's hot.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.257
All I got to do is stay off
of Mom's radar

You call this clean?

I have to say, Mom,
if you're just going

05:07.045 --> 05:08.743
to phone it in,
why even bother?

05:08.830 --> 05:11.180
You just bought yourself
two days grounded in your room.

05:11.267 --> 05:12.964
Fine.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.749
Maybe you can use that time
to learn how to roll socks.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.317
Make it three days.
You want to try for more?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.535
Nope. Three's perfect.

Oh, all right, all right.

in there.

Malcolm, stop. You're going
to ace it like you always do.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.211
That's just the point.

You totally expect

My teacher expects me
to get 100.

Everyone expects me
to get 100.

Do you know what it's like,

every time you do
anything in school,

06:34.916 --> 06:37.484
to have everyone expect
you to be perfect?

Do you have any idea what kind
of pressure that puts on you?

06:43.098 --> 06:44.708
It was so easy.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.884
I started with this load of crap
about my math test,

06:46.971 --> 06:49.234
and then the rest just came
pouring out of me so naturally.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.584
Before I knew it,

06:50.671 --> 06:51.889
she was telling me
to take the car

06:51.976 --> 06:53.674
and go and have fun
with my friends.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.197
She even gave me
money for gas.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.764
Nice.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.113
Is that a tear?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.593
No.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.209
Six boxes of cereal,

07:07.296 --> 07:08.732

and jelly sandwiches,

07:10.342 --> 07:12.040
adult diapers
and Mad Libs.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.128
You thought of everything.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.564
And I also packed
some barbells

07:14.651 --> 07:16.479
so I can get there
in fighting shape.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.394
They look like
soup cans.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.091
You noticed.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.484
See, there's a lot of things
that serve two purposes.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.790
Like my pillow.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.879
It's stuffed with M&M's

07:24.966 --> 07:27.098
so I can sleep
and snack from the same source.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.579
It's the same way NASA designed
the old space capsules.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.451
The very same.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.191
And you'll be ready with the
tapes to cover with Mom, right?

07:33.278 --> 07:35.455
-Yeah.
-All right, let's get moving.

for the 4:00 pick-up.

"fragile"?

to mean?

08:01.393 --> 08:03.526
And the journey begins.

Malcolm, you wouldn't happen
to know the life expectancy

08:11.708 --> 08:12.883

08:12.970 --> 08:14.363
I don't know.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.886
Great. What's the point
of hauling around

that giant head of yours

08:17.540 --> 08:19.368
if you can't retain
a few simple facts?

08:19.455 --> 08:21.849
Hal, he gets enough
pressure from school

08:21.936 --> 08:23.198
without his family
piling on.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.592
Did Mom just defend me?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.332
Wow, this vulnerability crap

is more effective
than I thought.

are stone cold.

them to him now.

REESE:
It's about time, butt-munch.

to eat this slop?

doing home?

It's that bee, Lois.

on my way to the car.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.450
I barely made it
back in here.

The damn thing won't
leave me alone.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.845
He's on some crazy vendetta.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.630
Hal!

09:03.717 --> 09:05.457
Okay, maybe it's not that crazy
when you think about it.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.634
I mean, I did kill all
his family and friends

09:07.721 --> 09:08.591
and basically
destroyed

09:08.678 --> 09:10.637
his whole world.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.726
That's got to come
as a blow.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.554
Hal, you have got
to go to work.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.598
I know.
You're right.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.600
This is absurd.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.384
Okay.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.908
Here's the plan, Lois.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.213
I am going to move

09:22.300 --> 09:23.519
very casually toward
the back door

09:23.606 --> 09:25.521
and draw his attention
over there.

09:25.608 --> 09:28.089
Once he's diverted,
you run lickety-split to my car

09:28.176 --> 09:29.873
and drive it right up here
to the side doors.

09:29.960 --> 09:30.961
Honk the horn.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.441
Two short beeps, then one long.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.834
I'll count to three--

09:33.921 --> 09:35.009
then we open the doors
simultaneously.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.619
You've got to be kidding me.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.579
Hey, I am not going to let
some bee run my life!

09:44.235 --> 09:45.541
Where are you going?

09:45.628 --> 09:46.890
Rick Kessler's party.

09:46.977 --> 09:47.935
How you getting there?

09:48.022 --> 09:49.414
I'm going to tell my mom

09:49.501 --> 09:51.286
how I can't beat people's
expectations

09:51.373 --> 09:52.853
on my science test.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.550
Are you a complete moron?

09:54.637 --> 09:57.292
-What?
-Amateurs.

09:57.379 --> 10:00.687
You are not trying to manipulate
a guy here, Malcolm.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.123
You have to use your brain.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.559
But it worked great last time.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.343
Which is why you can
never use it again.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.824
Especially with
your mom's radar.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.348
Come on, sit down,
listen to me.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.829
You got lucky the first time.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.526
But if you want
to pull this off

10:14.614 --> 10:16.180
getting the car two nights
in a row,

10:16.267 --> 10:17.921
you have to be
very, very good.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.706
Why can't I just...?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.621
Hey, do you want to ride
Jamie's Big Wheel to the party?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.187
I am telling you,

10:23.274 --> 10:25.581
you have to share
some real fear

10:25.668 --> 10:27.322
or feeling of inadequacy.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.976
If you are not
totally honest,

10:29.063 --> 10:30.499
she will see right through
your scam.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.370
Okay.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.546
So, like what?

10:34.634 --> 10:35.939
Well, I don't know.
What do you got?

10:36.026 --> 10:39.290
Well, I, uh...

10:39.377 --> 10:42.032
Come on, Malcolm,
your biggest problem
is choosing one.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.861
Okay, well, I'm not that tall.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.036
That's what you're
going with?

10:46.123 --> 10:47.690
I don't know. This is hard.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.910
We'll go down the list
and see which one

10:49.997 --> 10:51.868
makes you feel the most
uncomfortable.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.523
-We've established that
you're short.
-Yeah.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.481
-And pretty scrawny.
-Yeah.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.309
-And completely self-absorbed.
-Yeah.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.529
-Huge mother issues.
-Yeah.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.009
You don't really put out
a sexual vibe.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.358
-Hey!
-Bingo.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.412
It was amazing.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.371
We've never really
talked like that.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.679
She said she felt like
a total outcast in high school.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.506
She told me all this stuff.

11:21.593 --> 11:22.899
Like really personal stuff,

11:22.986 --> 11:24.509
but it didn't feel creepy

11:24.596 --> 11:25.772
like your mom's
telling you stuff.

11:25.859 --> 11:26.990
It was more like

11:27.077 --> 11:28.122
we were equals.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.950
It was great.

11:30.037 --> 11:30.951
Good work.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.300
Did you get the car?

11:32.387 --> 11:33.518
What?

11:33.605 --> 11:35.085
Oh, yeah.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.478
You know,

11:36.565 --> 11:38.306
I think I'm going
to skip the party.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.394
You're kidding.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.004
Yeah, I don't know, I just...

11:41.091 --> 11:43.441
I don't really feel like
going out.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.530
You know what?

11:45.617 --> 11:49.099
I think I'm going to stay home
and start a journal.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.799
[ engine droning]

11:52.886 --> 11:54.888
Stupid jet engine.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.243
Hey!

12:02.330 --> 12:04.854
Why don't you learn
how to fly this stupid thing?!

12:16.300 --> 12:17.824
Oh, sure, I feel lonely.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.782
Sometimes even with my
family all around me,

12:19.869 --> 12:21.828
I feel like
there's this...

12:21.915 --> 12:24.004
I don't know,
this gulf between us

12:24.091 --> 12:26.658
that I can't get across,
and maybe don't even want to.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.269
Does that sound awful?

12:28.356 --> 12:30.053
No, no. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.795
There's this deep chasm
of loneliness,

12:32.882 --> 12:35.493
but the weird thing is, it's...
it's not all that horrible.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.453
It's almost like this... this...

12:38.540 --> 12:39.671
Sweet pain?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.456
Oh, my God.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.675
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.677
Well, it's not something
I really talk about.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.549
I can't believe
I'm even telling you.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.290
Don't worry, Mom.
I... I understand.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.465
I really do.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.032
Oh, look at the time.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.163
Malcolm, we've gabbed
the whole morning away.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.556
I got to get
dressed for work.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.253
Go ahead.
I'll finish the dishes.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.516
I'm gonna take
you up on that.

13:00.431 --> 13:03.043
JESSICA:
That was genius.

13:04.566 --> 13:05.567
Jessica?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.047
You were there the whole time?

13:07.134 --> 13:09.571
Seriously, that was awesome.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.790
What are you going for?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.182
What? Nothing.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.881
Malcolm, it's me.
What are you after?

13:14.968 --> 13:16.578
I mean, you've got her
opening up to you.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.101
Forget about the car.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.233
With that level
of intimacy,

13:19.320 --> 13:21.104
I'd shoot for a laptop.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.714
We were just talking
about things we felt.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.109
Wow, Malcolm,
that's really...

13:26.196 --> 13:27.807
pathetic.

13:27.894 --> 13:28.677
Shut up.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.200
Listen, Monday I need you

13:30.287 --> 13:31.549
to get your mom
out of the house

13:31.636 --> 13:33.203
for a couple of
hours after school.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.552
Take her to a chick
flick or something.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.685
-You should enjoy that.
-What for?

13:36.772 --> 13:38.034
My boyfriend's coming
over, and I'd like

13:38.121 --> 13:39.209
to have the house
to ourselves,

13:39.296 --> 13:40.428
if you know what I mean.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.777
What?!

13:41.864 --> 13:43.648
Oh, good, you do know
what I mean.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.825
I wasn't sure with
that whole chasm of
loneliness crap.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.304
You can't hook up in my house.

13:47.391 --> 13:48.610
I've never hooked up
in my house.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.221
Okay, Malcolm,
it's your decision.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.310
Just a little worried
how your mom might react

13:53.397 --> 13:54.746
when she finds out
that the only reason

13:54.834 --> 13:57.053
you've been opening up
to her is to get her car.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.012
That's not even true anymore.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.014
Anyway, you'd look just as bad.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.320
Malcolm, my dad's in jail,
and I live on a couch.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.888
Looking bad isn't really
a big motivator for me.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.499
Now, you owe me.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.805
You'd really do it,
wouldn't you?

14:09.892 --> 14:13.200
Knowing me... yeah.

14:13.287 --> 14:16.029
Fine. But I can't believe
you're being like this.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.074
I thought you were helping me
because you were my friend.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.336
Yeah, Malcolm?

14:19.423 --> 14:22.078
Save the girl talk
for your mom.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.391
REESE:
"Day 23.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.001
"I'm out of food,

14:32.088 --> 14:34.699
"but I've never felt so focused and alive.

14:34.786 --> 14:37.833
I see everything now
with crystal clarity that..."

14:48.061 --> 14:49.801
"Day 24.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.499
"I must be getting close.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.762
I can smell the docks."

15:08.429 --> 15:10.344
I know Mommy wanted
us to go to the park,

15:10.431 --> 15:11.867
but why go outside

15:11.954 --> 15:13.477
where bad things
want to hurt Daddy

15:13.564 --> 15:15.610
when we can have just as
much fun inside the house,

15:15.697 --> 15:16.959
right, Jamie?

15:17.046 --> 15:20.354
How about a nice
shaving cream beard, huh?

15:20.441 --> 15:23.096
I did one last week at
work, and everyone loved it.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.575
[ gasps]

15:28.014 --> 15:29.885
[ screaming]

15:29.972 --> 15:30.973
No!

15:31.060 --> 15:32.453
No! No! Get away!

15:32.540 --> 15:33.758
Get away!

15:33.845 --> 15:35.412
[ whimpering]

15:35.499 --> 15:39.155
Don't worry, Jamie,
it's me he's after, not you.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.765
REESE [ on tape]:
Stop looking at me, Dewey.

15:40.852 --> 15:41.941
DEWEY:
I'm not looking at you.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.116
REESE:
Don't touch me.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.508
DEWEY:
I'm not touching you.

15:44.595 --> 15:45.553
REESE:
You're practically touching me.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.597
DEWEY:
Shut up.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.295
REESE:
You shut up.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.905
DEWEY: Why don't you?
REESE: Why don't you make me?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.515
DEWEY: Why don't you make me?
REESE: Maybe I will.

15:51.602 --> 15:54.301
He thinks he's on
his way to China,
and you've just

15:54.388 --> 15:56.216
been torturing
him in that box?!

15:56.303 --> 15:57.565
Yeah.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.914
Can he breathe
in there?

15:59.001 --> 16:00.568
He's still making noises.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.526
And he's got food and water?

16:02.613 --> 16:03.527
Yeah.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.359
All right.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.975
Honestly, Hal, I haven't felt
this close to Malcolm

16:16.062 --> 16:18.325
since he was four years old.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.807
Did I tell you he's taking me
to a movie tomorrow?

16:22.894 --> 16:24.984
I can't believe it.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.421
I mean, you put it out there,
but you don't know

16:27.508 --> 16:29.640
whether it'll ever come back
to you.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.816
And then, when it does,

16:31.903 --> 16:35.603
it's wonderful.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.867
It's worth all the crap
you have to put up with.

16:38.954 --> 16:43.132
Our boy is
growing up, Lois.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.656
Hmm. I'm very proud
of both of you.

16:45.743 --> 16:48.007
Thanks, honey.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.445
Can you turn off
the smoke now?

16:51.532 --> 16:53.664
In a minute.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.492
How long do we
have the place?

16:55.579 --> 16:56.885
At least two hours.
[giggles]

16:56.972 --> 16:58.626
So, what do you
want to do?

16:59.627 --> 17:01.194
[ moaning]

17:01.281 --> 17:03.239
Jessica, I have
to talk to you.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.501
Malcolm, what are you doing
here?

17:04.588 --> 17:06.025
Where's Lois?

17:06.112 --> 17:07.461
Still at the movies.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.202
[ sighs]:
I told her everything.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.420
I couldn't hold it back
from her.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.769
We were in the lobby,

17:11.856 --> 17:12.770
and I saw something
that reminded me

17:12.857 --> 17:13.989
of how much she really loves me.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.382
This mom was
holding up her son

17:15.469 --> 17:16.905
so he could get a drink
of water, and I thought,

17:16.992 --> 17:18.950
"What kind of Mom lets their kid
drink from a public

17:19.038 --> 17:20.560
drinking fountain?"

17:20.647 --> 17:22.301
She would have yelled at me
about all the germs,

17:22.388 --> 17:23.651
and I thought about how much
she really cares about me,

17:23.738 --> 17:25.044
and I couldn't
hold it back.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.132
Malcolm, we'll talk
about this later.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.308
It was horrible.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.484
I tried to explain
that getting close to her

17:30.571 --> 17:32.747
started off
as a way to use her, but...

17:32.834 --> 17:35.271
it turned into something real.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.621
But she didn't care.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.058
She was just too hurt.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.277
She said she didn't want
to look at me anymore.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.236
And then she walked right out
of Autumn Encounter

17:43.323 --> 17:45.412
and straight
into Body Count III.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.850
It's too bad, because Autumn
Encounterlooked really good.

17:48.937 --> 17:49.938
[ sobbing]

17:50.025 --> 17:51.244
Can I make myself
a sandwich?

17:51.331 --> 17:53.072
Wait. Mike,
this won't take long.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.117
[ crying]:
My mom used to
make me sandwiches.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.206
Now she'll never make
me sandwiches again.

17:57.293 --> 17:58.599
[ sobbing]

17:58.686 --> 18:01.080
Malcolm, pull
yourself together!

18:01.167 --> 18:02.385
This is kind of weird.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.822
Wait. Wait, Mike. Mike?

18:04.909 --> 18:08.609
[ sobbing]

18:12.308 --> 18:13.179
Hi.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.528
Hi.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.356
-I'm Mike, Jessica's friend.
-Dewey.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.748
Mind if I make myself
a sandwich?

18:17.835 --> 18:19.663
I don't care.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.539
Wait, can you do me
a favor first?

18:25.626 --> 18:28.019
There's this crate in the garage
I can't get open.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.325
You look really strong.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.935
Sure.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.334
[ exhales]

18:39.292 --> 18:41.990
Aha!
I bet you weren't
expecting this,Zhao!

18:42.077 --> 18:44.297
Now you're gonna experience a
good old American ass-whuppin'.

18:44.384 --> 18:45.385
[ grunts]

18:45.472 --> 18:46.516
Hey, quit it!

18:46.603 --> 18:48.562
I don't speak
Chinese, jackass.

18:48.649 --> 18:49.650
[ grunts]

18:49.737 --> 18:52.566
All right.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.577
[ sighs]

19:07.798 --> 19:08.973
[ hums, then gasps]

19:09.060 --> 19:10.714
You!

19:10.801 --> 19:13.326
Okay, let's...

19:13.413 --> 19:15.284
stay calm.

19:15.371 --> 19:18.157
Let's not do anything stupid.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.596
Eat wind, honey sucker!

19:22.683 --> 19:25.164
[ screaming]
[ tires screeching]

19:26.687 --> 19:29.429
[ shrieking]

19:29.516 --> 19:30.995
[ shuddering whimpers]

19:47.011 --> 19:48.491
[ chuckling]

19:48.578 --> 19:49.797
[ sighs]

20:23.352 --> 20:24.962
[ growling]

20:34.363 --> 20:35.495
[ gasps]

20:35.582 --> 20:39.238
[ tires screeching]

20:46.680 --> 20:50.901
This... ends... now.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.254
[ yelling]

21:05.220 --> 21:07.222
Is everything okay?

21:07.309 --> 21:11.531
Everything is just fine.

21:14.447 --> 21:18.146
[chuckles]
Who's the idiot now?
