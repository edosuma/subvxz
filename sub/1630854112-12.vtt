WEBVTT

00:03.729 --> 00:04.670
(knocking)

00:04.672 --> 00:06.171
Bobby?

00:07.174 --> 00:09.416
-Bobby, open up.
-(doorbell rings)

00:09.568 --> 00:11.510
He ever gone MIA
like this before?

00:11.661 --> 00:13.012
(sighs) No.

00:13.239 --> 00:14.496
Honestly, I-I don't know much
about his story

00:14.590 --> 00:17.758
before he took over the house,
just that he, uh...

00:17.926 --> 00:20.627
-he's in recovery.
-Hey, wait, wait, wait.

00:20.779 --> 00:21.912
(phone ringing distantly)

00:21.930 --> 00:23.981
Hear that?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.253
Bobby?

00:29.271 --> 00:31.572
(phone continues ringing)

00:51.034 --> 00:52.760
Help.

00:55.614 --> 00:57.723
(sobbing)

01:02.396 --> 01:05.305
WENDALL: God, grant me
the serenity to accept

01:05.457 --> 01:07.474
the things I cannot change...

01:07.626 --> 01:10.294
ALL:
...the courage to change
the things I can,

01:10.312 --> 01:13.146
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

01:13.299 --> 01:14.981
That's it for today.

01:15.076 --> 01:18.969
But remember, whether it's been
24 hours since your last drink,

01:19.062 --> 01:20.746
or 24 years...

01:20.973 --> 01:22.748
we've all found
the courage to be here.

01:22.975 --> 01:26.293
And hope to see you again soon.

01:28.981 --> 01:31.815
Nice to see you, brother.

01:31.834 --> 01:32.907
WOMAN:
See you next week.

01:33.001 --> 01:36.261
-Hi.
-Hi. Good to see you, too.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.508
You've been here before.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.977
Nope.

01:45.664 --> 01:47.347
I've been there myself.

01:47.499 --> 01:49.090
In that foxhole.

01:49.184 --> 01:51.110
Hiding out in the back row,

01:51.337 --> 01:52.760
the thousand-yard stare.

01:52.780 --> 01:56.448
Guarded.
Hiding from undue shame.

01:56.675 --> 02:00.160
I have been on
that same battlefield.

02:02.272 --> 02:04.439
But I don't take you
for a fellow Marine.

02:04.533 --> 02:08.276
Maybe a... cop.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.712
Firefighter.

02:11.948 --> 02:14.633
I'm right only a third
of the time.

02:16.378 --> 02:18.211
I know those crossed arms
are supposed to be a sign

02:18.364 --> 02:20.097
that you don't want company.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.217
Sorry to tell you, for me,

02:24.370 --> 02:28.647
it's a signal,
that someone needs support.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.134
You might not think so
right now.

02:33.154 --> 02:36.655
But you made it a point
to come here today.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.492
Some coworkers brought me in.

02:40.719 --> 02:42.810
You drinking at work?

02:42.905 --> 02:46.331
-It happens.
-Not to me.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.409
I know this isn't
your regular meeting,

02:49.561 --> 02:52.379
but do you have a regular
someone to talk to?

02:53.899 --> 02:57.584
I did back in Minnesota,
but not since I moved here.

02:57.736 --> 02:59.920
Mostly I just go to church.

03:00.072 --> 03:02.664
I'm all for talking
to the man upstairs.

03:02.832 --> 03:04.349
But sometimes...

03:04.535 --> 03:07.019
you need someone
who can talk back.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.651
I've been feeling a little lost.

03:16.255 --> 03:20.115
Then let's help you
find your way back.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.039
(sirens wailing)

03:27.266 --> 03:30.751
You think that somebody
did this on purpose?

03:32.362 --> 03:36.215
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

03:36.366 --> 03:37.883
Mm.

03:38.110 --> 03:39.943
Looks like you've been up
awhile.

03:39.962 --> 03:41.869
Oh.

03:41.964 --> 03:43.871
Yep. Wendall's son called.

03:43.891 --> 03:47.284
Medical examiner finally got
the toxicology results back.

03:47.302 --> 03:51.063
And the official finding is that
Wendall died of a drug overdose.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.380
And since he didn't die

03:52.474 --> 03:53.732
on the premises
of the rehab facility...

03:53.959 --> 03:57.736
They're closing the
investigation into Winding Path?

03:57.887 --> 03:59.463
-Yeah.
-Aww.

03:59.481 --> 04:02.557
It's not like any of this
is a surprise.

04:02.651 --> 04:04.968
There's been dozens of
investigations into that place,

04:05.061 --> 04:07.971
-nothing ever sticks.
-(Athena sighs)

04:08.064 --> 04:09.806
I'm sorry, baby.

04:09.825 --> 04:11.917
Four months of searching

04:12.144 --> 04:13.994
and this is all
we've come up with.

04:14.146 --> 04:15.645
It's not all.

04:15.814 --> 04:18.239
I was thinking about that girl
that you and May met,

04:18.259 --> 04:20.575
-at Winding Path.
-Tamara.

04:20.669 --> 04:21.760
Yeah.

04:21.987 --> 04:23.820
Maybe it's time to try
talking to her again.

04:23.913 --> 04:27.173
You did say that May thought she
was making progress with her.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.750
Until the conversation
turned to Wendall.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.437
And then Tamara shut her down
and cut off all communication.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.921
With May.

04:33.999 --> 04:35.515
I'm thinking she might
talk to me.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.517
We're both in recovery.
We both knew Wendall.

04:37.669 --> 04:39.528
Could be an opening.

04:41.006 --> 04:44.541
Athena, I need to talk to her.

04:44.543 --> 04:48.287
There might be a way.

04:50.124 --> 04:56.295
♪<i> Don't wait too long</i>

04:56.522 --> 05:02.283

05:02.303 --> 05:05.637

05:05.864 --> 05:07.789
Hi. Tamara?

05:07.883 --> 05:10.050
Yeah, uh, do I know you?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.568
I'm May's stepdad.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.703
-I think she told you about me?
-(scoffs)

05:13.797 --> 05:15.205
Ambushing people
in flower shops.

05:15.223 --> 05:16.540
Is that the family trait?

05:16.633 --> 05:17.983
I didn't know how else
to get ahold of you.

05:18.134 --> 05:19.726
May said you stopped
returning her calls.

05:19.878 --> 05:21.320
Usually a sign that someone
doesn't want to talk to you.

05:21.547 --> 05:24.898
Okay, listen, I'm sorry for just
showing up here like this,

05:25.050 --> 05:26.641
but Wendall was
a really good friend.

05:26.735 --> 05:29.578
And he pulled me out of more
than a few dark places.

05:30.647 --> 05:32.313
I think you knew him, too.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.498
If you knew him like I did,

05:33.725 --> 05:35.559
you know he was a good man.

05:35.577 --> 05:37.577
And he did not deserve
to die alone

05:37.729 --> 05:38.895
in an abandoned lot like that.

05:38.988 --> 05:41.414
No matter what was going on
with him.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.324
(whispering):
He didn't die there.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.418
What?

05:45.571 --> 05:48.287
He didn't die there.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.973
Okay.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.168
Listen, Tamara,
he came to see me

05:54.188 --> 05:55.412
a couple days before he died,

05:55.430 --> 05:56.746
and I could tell
something was off,

05:56.765 --> 05:58.598
but I couldn't tell what,
and I didn't push.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.100
Now, Wendall, you know,
he-he would've pushed.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.435
He wouldn't have given up
until I let him in.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.197
I let him in, too.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.682
(exhales)

06:07.701 --> 06:09.534
And then I pulled him down
with me.

06:09.686 --> 06:11.536
Pulled him down?
What do you mean?

06:11.763 --> 06:13.597
Is this after you met him
at Winding Path?

06:13.690 --> 06:16.433
No. We met before that.

06:16.451 --> 06:18.284
Wendall was never
a patient there.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.528
He only checked himself in
to help me.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.863
To help all of us.

06:21.957 --> 06:23.548
He knew something was wrong
with that place.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.716
And he was gonna prove it.

06:24.826 --> 06:26.109
Prove it how?

06:26.111 --> 06:27.702
You have to let this go.

06:27.796 --> 06:30.138
Or you'll end up like Wendall.

06:39.458 --> 06:42.475
Hey, you do remember
that I-I live alone, right?

06:42.628 --> 06:44.144
But you're supposed
to be taking it easy

06:44.296 --> 06:45.962
and letting your body heal,
so I thought I would save you

06:45.981 --> 06:47.147
a few trips
to the grocery store.

06:47.299 --> 06:48.407
For the next six months?

06:48.634 --> 06:50.150
For however long it takes you
to recover.

06:50.302 --> 06:51.893
Maddie, I'm fine. (sighs)

06:52.061 --> 06:54.579
Buck. You died.

06:54.731 --> 06:56.473
Okay? And not almost,

06:56.491 --> 06:58.083
you actually died.

06:58.234 --> 07:00.994
We don't know the long-term
repercussions of that.

07:01.146 --> 07:02.646
Well, it was only
for three minutes.

07:02.664 --> 07:05.165
Come on. If I can't
make a joke about dying,

07:05.317 --> 07:07.092
what's the point in living?

07:09.171 --> 07:11.171
Okay, uh, hey, don't you
have a shift today?

07:11.265 --> 07:12.764
Are you trying to get rid of me?

07:12.916 --> 07:14.491
No, I'm just turning the tables.

07:14.509 --> 07:16.176
You know, I'm starting
to worry about you

07:16.344 --> 07:18.662
because you have a job,
you have a new house,

07:18.680 --> 07:20.421
you have a little girl that
needs taking care of.

07:20.441 --> 07:24.334
-You shouldn't be running
over here all the time.
-I don't mind.

07:24.352 --> 07:26.336
Well, I can tell
that you don't mind,

07:26.354 --> 07:29.522
but I promise you I can take
care of myself, okay?

07:29.675 --> 07:31.116
My fingers are not broken,

07:31.267 --> 07:33.677
I can order my own food.

07:33.770 --> 07:37.530
Although, I will admit that pot
roast does smell pretty good.

07:37.683 --> 07:39.849
It'll be ready in two hours,
you can have it for lunch.

07:39.868 --> 07:42.352
Well, maybe I'll
take a nap until then.

07:42.370 --> 07:45.505
Fine, I'm going to work now.

07:46.708 --> 07:47.874
(sighs)

07:47.968 --> 07:51.303
Uh, listen, hey, um...
thank you, okay?

07:51.530 --> 07:52.954
I do appreciate
what you're doing,

07:53.031 --> 07:54.639
it's just I don't need you
to fuss over me.

07:54.716 --> 07:58.535
I'm just glad that you're
still here to fuss over.

07:58.553 --> 08:00.145
Yeah, me, too.

08:00.296 --> 08:03.148
<i> BOBBY:</i>
<i> And then she just ran off.</i>

08:03.375 --> 08:04.632
That girl was so scared.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.467
Yeah, with good reason.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.320
Maybe that's why
they gave her a job there.

08:08.471 --> 08:11.397
Keep tabs on her,
make sure she doesn't talk.

08:11.550 --> 08:12.473
Hmm.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.809
She said Wendall
was going to prove

08:14.978 --> 08:16.661
that something was wrong
at Winding Path.

08:16.888 --> 08:18.312
That's why he checked
himself in.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.724
I guess he wanted to see for
himself what was going on there.

08:20.892 --> 08:22.892
Yeah, maybe to collect evidence.

08:22.986 --> 08:25.086
What kind of evidence?

08:26.398 --> 08:28.006
Sounds like an undercover sting.

08:28.233 --> 08:31.584
You know, send someone in
posed as a criminal,

08:31.737 --> 08:34.904
to bear witness to
the commission of a crime.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.130
Well, that would be
a police operation.

08:36.241 --> 08:37.164
As far as we know,
Wendall wasn't working

08:37.333 --> 08:38.742
with the authorities.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.744
Oh, you don't have to be police
to go undercover, Bobby.

08:40.762 --> 08:44.764
Journalists, filmmakers,
even private citizens nowadays.

08:44.916 --> 08:46.358
Right. All you need is a camera.

08:50.756 --> 08:51.863
Here.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.032
A $300 purchase to
an electronics website.

08:54.183 --> 08:56.701
Same week he died.

08:56.853 --> 08:59.371
Okay, even if Wendall installed
the camera, that was months ago.

08:59.598 --> 09:02.523
What do you think the chances
are any recordings still exist?

09:02.617 --> 09:04.768
Not sure. But...

09:04.828 --> 09:08.104
I do know some people who
might be able to tell me.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.531
I'm gonna take this
down to the station

09:10.700 --> 09:12.133
and ask the techs.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.202
Hey. Thank you.

09:15.371 --> 09:16.946
I don't know if I ever slowed
down enough to tell you

09:17.040 --> 09:18.948
how much I appreciate
you doing this with me.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.709
You know, Wendall wasn't
your sponsor and...

09:21.728 --> 09:24.729
Look, I know how important
he was to you.

09:24.956 --> 09:26.289
And to this family.

09:26.308 --> 09:30.026
You're not the only one
who misses him.

09:31.630 --> 09:33.280
(inhales sharply)

09:45.327 --> 09:47.127
(sighs)

09:48.755 --> 09:51.131
(knocking)

09:52.000 --> 09:52.924
(sighs)

09:53.076 --> 09:54.092
(grunts)

09:54.243 --> 09:56.595
(knocking continues)

10:01.676 --> 10:03.584
Sorry. Did I wake you?

10:03.678 --> 10:05.678
Uh, it's okay.

10:05.831 --> 10:08.514
Thought I'd swing by
and see how you're doing.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.317
Make sure you're not
climbing the walls.

10:10.393 --> 10:12.518
Nope, just-just the stairs.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.520
(sniffs)

10:14.673 --> 10:16.522
Something smells good.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.674
Is that pot roast?

10:17.767 --> 10:19.934
It is. Uh, come on in.

10:20.028 --> 10:21.745
You're just in time for lunch.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.793
Your sister makes
a good pot roast.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.537
Uh, yeah. It's kind of
her go-to meal.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.007
(both laughing)

10:35.636 --> 10:37.135
Karen makes it in a Crock-Pot.

10:37.362 --> 10:39.712
We, uh, we never had one
of those growing up.

10:39.789 --> 10:42.048
My father always said
it was a fad.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.975
He might've been thinking
of a fondue pot.

10:44.202 --> 10:46.703
Though those do
keep coming back.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.462
Every ten years, like clockwork.

10:48.556 --> 10:50.798
I think someone gave me one
of those when I moved in here.

10:50.892 --> 10:53.559
In fact, uh, I think it was you.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.379
Karen and I got four
when we got married.

10:56.398 --> 10:58.715
I'm still trying to
get rid of the last two.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.809
Re-gifting is my love language.

11:01.903 --> 11:04.237
Uh, hey, so did I pass?

11:04.389 --> 11:06.906
The Dr. Wilson follow-up exam.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.742
Or do you need to check my pulse
while you're here?

11:09.895 --> 11:12.462
Oh, you know what? I should.

11:13.398 --> 11:16.007
Okay. Uh, ow. What was that for?

11:16.159 --> 11:17.567
Ungratefulness.

11:17.736 --> 11:21.754
So what'd your cardiologist
say that's gotten you so cranky?

11:21.848 --> 11:24.331
(sighs)
Um, nothing.

11:24.426 --> 11:27.744
No, she just keeps on ordering
tests and doing scans.

11:27.762 --> 11:31.431
I had to wear this Holter
monitor device for two days.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.766
And I couldn't use my cell phone
or microwave.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.603
But I just keep on waiting
for her to tell me I'm okay.

11:37.756 --> 11:39.088
Or that I'm not okay.

11:39.107 --> 11:42.275
Just something.
Instead, it's just more tests.

11:42.427 --> 11:44.277
You think it's gonna
be bad news?

11:44.429 --> 11:46.705
That's the thing.
I-I don't know.

11:46.856 --> 11:49.449
I mean, I really do,
uh, I feel fine.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.117
But?

11:51.269 --> 11:53.937
But I also felt pretty good

11:53.939 --> 11:56.715
right before I got struck
by lightning.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.709
<i> WENDALL: You're mistaking</i>
<i> a mistake, Bobby.</i>

12:08.803 --> 12:10.711
You're the one who told me
to get back out there again.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.379
I thought you'd be happy.

12:12.457 --> 12:14.140
I actually thought you'd try to
take credit for the whole thing.

12:14.292 --> 12:16.884
I told you to get out and date,
maybe some nice dinners,

12:16.978 --> 12:18.144
a couple of movies,

12:18.238 --> 12:21.222
maybe some sexy fun times
between the sheets.

12:21.316 --> 12:23.816
Don't worry, all that's
definitely happening.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.560
I wanted you to rejoin
the world and live.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.821
But asking this woman
to marry you?

12:28.974 --> 12:29.655
You haven't even been
together a year.

12:29.808 --> 12:31.065
That's impulsive.

12:31.309 --> 12:34.160
And acting impulsively is
dangerous for people like us.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.163
But you need to meet her,
it's how she makes me feel.

12:37.315 --> 12:38.423
Like you're flying high?

12:38.574 --> 12:40.550
Like I'm standing
on solid ground.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.744
After years of having...

12:43.764 --> 12:45.238
nothing to hold on to,

12:45.389 --> 12:47.098
no way to keep myself
from spinning out of control,

12:47.250 --> 12:48.674
I found her and...

12:49.828 --> 12:52.103
...with that, maybe a piece
of myself again.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.754
(sighs)

12:53.774 --> 12:55.181
Just do us both a favor

12:55.333 --> 12:57.275
and slow down a little.

12:57.502 --> 13:00.528
At least promise
it'll be a long engagement.

13:04.009 --> 13:05.116
So no luck tracking down
the purchase?

13:05.268 --> 13:07.043
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> Not yet.</i>

13:07.045 --> 13:09.695

13:10.865 --> 13:12.031
<i> The tech guys</i>

13:12.125 --> 13:13.792
did mention something
interesting, though.

13:13.943 --> 13:17.537

<i>he didn't have a camera on him.</i>

13:17.631 --> 13:19.130

A piece of circuitry.

<i> Which means maybe it wasn't</i>
<i> a camera that you wear.</i>

13:25.639 --> 13:27.305
It could've been a camera

13:31.536 --> 13:33.794
<i> or something that could</i>

Uh, listen, I got to go.

Connor.

13:47.552 --> 13:51.070
Hey, uh...
did my sister call you?

13:51.222 --> 13:52.813
-Was she supposed to?
-No.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.649
(chuckles) Uh, come on in.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.502
Can I get you a drink
or anything?

13:57.653 --> 13:59.170
Yes, please. (chuckles)

13:59.397 --> 14:01.731
I just wanted to check
on you, though, man.

14:01.749 --> 14:03.341
I brought some brownies.

14:03.492 --> 14:05.068
Un, not the special kind
of brownies

14:05.161 --> 14:07.178
-Kyle's mom used to make?
-(chuckling): No.

14:07.330 --> 14:10.664
I still don't understand
the point of a fiber brownie.

14:10.758 --> 14:12.350
Right, uh...

14:12.501 --> 14:14.835
Hey, man, so how is everything?
How-How's Cameron doing?

14:14.929 --> 14:18.081
Uh, she's great, actually.

14:18.099 --> 14:20.266
You know, I thought pregnancy
was gonna be more like

14:20.418 --> 14:21.934
naps and morning sickness,

14:22.087 --> 14:23.344
but the woman's got
more energy than ever.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.605
That's great, right?
Must be exciting.

14:25.773 --> 14:28.441
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.869
You hope for something
for so long

14:31.020 --> 14:34.113
and then when
it finally happens...

14:34.265 --> 14:35.615
it doesn't quite feel real.

14:35.767 --> 14:40.861
Well, uh, it's gonna feel
pretty real pretty soon.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.548
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be great.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.367
Um, but what about you,
though, man?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.701
I tried calling.

14:47.721 --> 14:51.130
Uh, yeah, I was-I was living
in a cell-free zone.

14:51.282 --> 14:53.116
But no, I-I'm good,
I got no complaints.

14:53.209 --> 14:55.209
Just waiting for the doctor
to give me

14:55.228 --> 14:57.378
the all-clear to resume my life.

14:57.472 --> 14:59.305
All the rest and relaxation
starting to get to you, huh?

14:59.382 --> 15:00.732
(knocking)

15:00.883 --> 15:03.550
You know, there's been less of
that than you might think.

15:03.645 --> 15:04.903
Uh, give me one second.

15:05.054 --> 15:07.363
(knocking)

15:08.967 --> 15:10.408
I brought Sudoku.

15:10.559 --> 15:11.993
Hi, Josh. (sighs)

15:12.987 --> 15:14.228
JOSH:
Oh, sorry.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.155
-Did I get my time wrong?
-BUCK: I don't know.

15:16.307 --> 15:18.565
What time did Maddie
tell you to be here?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.960
Uh... (mumbles)

15:21.980 --> 15:23.087
Okay.

15:24.499 --> 15:27.333
<i> MADDIE:</i>
<i> I promise that you didn't ruin</i>
<i> anything, Josh.</i>

15:27.427 --> 15:29.502
He was on to me
way before you showed up.

15:29.654 --> 15:31.095
But thanks for checking in
on him.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.673
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.508
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.993
Let me guess.

15:37.011 --> 15:39.771
Operation Buck Up Buttercup
has been blown?

15:39.922 --> 15:41.347
He was suspicious
of the pot roast,

15:41.441 --> 15:42.923
but he figured it out by Sudoku.

15:43.001 --> 15:46.018
Because, as much as I like
making fun of your brother,

15:46.095 --> 15:47.111
he's not an actual idiot.

15:47.263 --> 15:48.504
Which is good news.

15:48.523 --> 15:49.596
Because I know you're
worried about him

15:49.765 --> 15:50.949
doing too much, too fast,

15:51.100 --> 15:52.933
but I think he's taking
his recovery seriously.

15:53.027 --> 15:55.361
I really hope so.

15:55.530 --> 15:58.623
What is this?

15:58.774 --> 15:59.958
That is a fondue set.

16:00.109 --> 16:02.685
Hen dropped it off.
No, I don't know why.

16:02.704 --> 16:04.370
-(phone chimes)
-Is that Buck?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.964
Julie Rosen.

16:06.115 --> 16:08.357
She and some of the guys were
supposed to bring him dinner.

16:08.376 --> 16:10.359
He was not home,
but he left a note:

16:10.453 --> 16:12.211
"Tell Maddie I went out."

16:12.305 --> 16:14.955
Uh-oh. He's gone on the lam.

-Eh, probably more than one.

Hey, what do you remember
about getting shot?

19:41.406 --> 19:43.072
There was a searing pain.

19:43.090 --> 19:45.257
It felt like I got hit by a bus.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.759
And I was still standing.

19:46.911 --> 19:48.686
I remember falling.

19:48.837 --> 19:52.106
And everything got dark.

19:53.676 --> 19:56.085
And I thought, this is it.

19:56.178 --> 19:58.905
This is the last moment
of my life.

19:59.774 --> 20:02.516

That was it.

20:07.356 --> 20:10.041
No bright white lights,
no trippy mind puzzles, just...

20:10.192 --> 20:11.450
thought I was dead and...

20:11.602 --> 20:13.961
then I wasn't.

20:15.531 --> 20:18.382
So now am I allowed

Sometimes all at the same time.

Because today...

41:04.963 --> 41:08.781
would've been my friend
and sponsor Wendall's...

41:08.800 --> 41:11.693
ten-year anniversary
of sobriety.

41:11.786 --> 41:15.138
We talked about milestones
like this when I first got here.

41:15.289 --> 41:17.957
Actually, when I first got here,
Wendall did most of the talking.

41:18.051 --> 41:19.625
(laughter)

41:19.719 --> 41:23.554
And we started setting these
goals for ourselves.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.707
He had his, I had mine.

41:25.841 --> 41:27.633
And slowly they became the same.

41:27.727 --> 41:29.711
And more slowly still,

41:29.804 --> 41:31.804
along with others,

41:31.823 --> 41:35.399
Wendall helped save my life.

41:35.552 --> 41:40.238
And he reminded me that there
is always a reason to live,

41:40.390 --> 41:42.557
to fight for another day.

41:42.726 --> 41:45.317
And that no matter how dark
that tunnel gets,

41:45.337 --> 41:48.213
there's always a light
at the end of it.

41:49.399 --> 41:50.840
And that part of that darkness

41:51.067 --> 41:52.583
is believing that
it will never end,

41:52.736 --> 41:54.919
that we will never be free.

41:55.071 --> 41:57.847
But that is a lie.

41:57.999 --> 41:59.849
That is a lie.

41:59.959 --> 42:02.744
And our addiction
is fuel on that fire.

42:02.762 --> 42:05.504
So now if I find myself walking
down that dark tunnel,

42:05.598 --> 42:08.099
I will know that Wendall
is still with me.

42:09.010 --> 42:12.103
All I have to do
is reach out my hand.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.532

by asking if...

42:18.352 --> 42:22.187
anyone feels a burning need
to use or do self-harm,

42:22.282 --> 42:25.542
because if so, we are here...

42:25.769 --> 42:29.128
to listen and help.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.775
Oh, excuse me.

42:34.460 --> 42:37.703
