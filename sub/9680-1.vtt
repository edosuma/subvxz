02:24.854 --> 02:27.273
<i>131 to dispatch, come in.</i>

02:40.077 --> 02:42.121
Hey hey hey hey!

02:47.543 --> 02:49.712
<i>131, this is dispatch. Go ahead.</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:52.173
<i>This is 131.
We have a male, mid-50s,</i>

02:52.298 --> 02:54.884
<i>with burns over 9% to 9.5%
of his body.</i>

02:55.009 --> 02:58.095
<i>Prior to our arrival on scene,
patient apparently doused his head,</i>

02:58.220 --> 03:01.265
<i>neck and face with some sort of
highly-concentrated acid.</i>

03:01.390 --> 03:04.768
<i>The patient's airway is severely
compromised due to fume inhalation.</i>

03:04.894 --> 03:06.562
<i>Vital signs unstable.</i>

03:06.687 --> 03:09.106
<i>Please advise- patient is
a criminal suspect.</i>

03:09.231 --> 03:11.609
<i>We're coming in
with a police escort right now.</i>

03:32.463 --> 03:34.840
Hi.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.800
Can I talk to him?

03:39.637 --> 03:41.931
He can't actually talk.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.564
All right.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.441
Jesus.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.527
Can I just have
a few minutes with him?

05:02.303 --> 05:04.763
We want to know who you are.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.142
We'll find out, you know,
sooner or later.

05:08.267 --> 05:12.479
So just save us some legwork
by communicating with us now.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.734
Are you a Satanist?

05:16.859 --> 05:20.487
Are you involved
in some kind of cult?

05:20.613 --> 05:22.907
'Cause if there's others involved,
we'll get them.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.825
We'll find them, believe me.

05:26.202 --> 05:28.537
What's the matter?

05:28.662 --> 05:31.457
Is that it?
That's it, right?

05:31.582 --> 05:35.002
Is there somebody you want
to tell me about?

05:40.799 --> 05:41.884
I'm sorry,

05:42.009 --> 05:44.303
the nurse at reception
downstairs is on the phone.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.931
She wants to talk to you,
says it's urgent.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.683
Okay.

05:58.067 --> 06:01.028
I'll be right back, okay?

06:16.544 --> 06:18.170
Thank you very much...

06:18.295 --> 06:19.630
Yeah.

06:19.755 --> 06:22.132
...Reverend Clergy all,

06:22.258 --> 06:23.968
Senator Hawkins...

06:24.093 --> 06:26.387
His daughter?
When was this?

06:26.512 --> 06:29.765
Is she still here?

06:34.228 --> 06:36.313
Well, did she leave
any information,

06:36.438 --> 06:38.399
a phone number?

06:40.192 --> 06:42.319
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?

06:47.324 --> 06:49.869
Dispatch, this is Baker 17.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.954
I'm gonna need
a medical backup.

06:57.293 --> 06:59.712
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.839
Somebody help!

07:22.693 --> 07:25.070
There is sin and evil in the world,

07:25.196 --> 07:28.032
and we're enjoined by Scripture
and the Lord Jesus

07:28.157 --> 07:30.618
to oppose it with all our might.

07:30.743 --> 07:34.163
Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil
with which it must deal.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.458
The glory of this land
has been its capacity

07:37.583 --> 07:39.877
for transcending the moral evils
of our past.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.546
Alexis de Tocqueville
put it eloquently

07:42.671 --> 07:44.798
after he had gone on a search
for the secret

07:44.924 --> 07:47.760
of America's greatness
and genius-

07:47.885 --> 07:50.763
"Not until I went
into the churches of America

07:50.888 --> 07:54.934
and heard her pulpits
aflame with righteousness

07:55.059 --> 07:59.813
did I understand the greatness
and the genius of America."

07:59.939 --> 08:03.150
America is good.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.570
And if America
ever ceases to be good-

08:15.120 --> 08:18.666
<i>Eat some now,
save some for later</i>

08:18.791 --> 08:21.502
<i>Eat some now, save some for later</i>

08:21.627 --> 08:23.796
<i>Now & Later</i>

08:23.921 --> 08:26.257
<i>The really tasty ones</i>

08:26.382 --> 08:28.467
<i>Now & Later</i>

08:28.592 --> 08:31.387
<i>For all-day children's fun</i>

08:31.512 --> 08:33.639
<i>Look at all those pieces...</i>

08:33.764 --> 08:37.183
- Owen!
- <i>Flavors, oh they're wild</i>

08:37.308 --> 08:40.563
<i>Eat some now, save some for later,
eat some now, save some for later...</i>

08:40.688 --> 08:43.148
- Owen!
- What?

08:43.274 --> 08:45.693
Dinnertime, honey.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.717
Bless us O Lord
for these Thy gifts

09:09.842 --> 09:11.427
which we are about to receive.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.554
Please guide and direct us
through all our days

09:13.679 --> 09:15.806
and protect us from evil.
Amen.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.644
So how was school today?

09:28.694 --> 09:31.238
You didn't go and spoil your dinner
on me now, did you, Owen?

09:31.363 --> 09:32.865
No.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.992
- Owen, sweetie-
- No, I didn't.

09:37.036 --> 09:39.538
Eat, please, honey.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.752
Hello.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.837
What?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.758
Look, I'm not gonna
discuss this now, okay?

09:50.883 --> 09:52.551
We're eating dinner.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.142
We had an agreement, John.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.940
I think maybe you'd better
call my lawyer, okay?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.738
Don't talk to me like that!

10:15.699 --> 10:18.702
I will not be spoken to
in that way.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.498
...Judgment to fall.

10:22.623 --> 10:26.168
And if we as a people
turn back to God...

10:31.131 --> 10:32.842
These are the young people.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.928
The young people are beginning
to turn back to God

10:36.053 --> 10:39.473
Who's waiting on them.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.767
If the Lord calls you,

10:41.892 --> 10:43.185
then the Word comes.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.646
And the Word came
from the Lord...

10:47.815 --> 10:50.234
Hey little girl.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.654
Are you a little girl?

10:53.779 --> 10:56.240
Huh?

10:56.365 --> 10:57.783
Are you scared?

11:27.188 --> 11:29.773
<i>Let's dance</i>

11:29.899 --> 11:31.817
<i>Put on your red shoes</i>

11:31.942 --> 11:34.278
<i>And dance the blues</i>

11:35.863 --> 11:38.157
<i>Let's dance</i>

11:38.282 --> 11:40.284
<i>To the song they're playin'</i>

11:40.409 --> 11:42.453
<i>On the radio</i>

11:44.413 --> 11:50.586
<i>Let's sway while color
lights up your face...</i>

14:47.263 --> 14:50.808
I pledge allegiance to the flag

14:50.933 --> 14:53.269
of the United States of America

14:53.394 --> 14:56.939
and to the republic
for which it stands,

14:57.064 --> 15:01.277
one nation under God,
indivisible,

15:01.402 --> 15:04.029
with liberty and justice for all.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.514
- Stop!
- How's it going?

15:30.639 --> 15:34.101
Stop it. Mr. Zoric.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.189
Okay, Kenny, 10 laps now.

15:38.314 --> 15:39.899
I didn't do anything.

15:40.024 --> 15:41.442
Now!

15:41.567 --> 15:43.569
Or I'll make it 20.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.227
Hey little girl.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.775
Ow! Don't.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.360
Are you a little girl?

16:24.485 --> 16:26.237
Ow.

16:26.362 --> 16:28.197
That's why he won't
go swimming.

16:28.322 --> 16:31.283
He doesn't want everyone to see
what a little fucking girl he is.

16:33.786 --> 16:35.704
Ow.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.081
Stop.

16:37.206 --> 16:39.124
- Get down. Get his arms.
- Stop.

16:39.250 --> 16:41.085
- Get his arms.
- Ow ow.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.586
Little shit.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.964
Stop.

16:45.089 --> 16:48.050
Ow! Stop! Ow!

16:48.175 --> 16:51.428
Stop, it hurts!

16:51.554 --> 16:53.347
No no no! Shit.

16:53.472 --> 16:57.184
Ow! Stop!

16:57.309 --> 16:58.561
Ow!

16:58.686 --> 17:00.813
Dude, I think he pissed himself.

17:00.938 --> 17:02.773
Oh shit.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.942
What the fuck?
He pissed himself.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.236
Jesus Christ, fucking freak.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.449
- Jesus.
- That was awesome.

17:12.575 --> 17:16.453
Owen! Owen!

17:16.579 --> 17:19.039
Owen pissed himself!

17:21.125 --> 17:23.210
<i>Turning down,
I'm turning in, I'm turning round</i>

17:23.335 --> 17:25.588
<i>I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese</i>

17:25.713 --> 17:28.214
<i>I really think so...</i>

17:28.339 --> 17:31.010
<i>Turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese</i>

17:31.135 --> 17:33.512
<i>I really think so...</i>

17:33.637 --> 17:36.182
Is that gonna be it?

17:39.643 --> 17:41.854
<i>Turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese</i>

17:41.979 --> 17:44.315
<i>I really think so...</i>

17:49.904 --> 17:51.822
Are you scared?

17:51.947 --> 17:54.158
Are you scared, little girl?

17:54.283 --> 17:56.285
Huh?

18:14.637 --> 18:16.388
What are you doing?

18:16.514 --> 18:18.432
Nothing.

18:18.557 --> 18:21.018
What are you doing?

18:22.019 --> 18:23.729
Nothing.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.898
You- you guys
just moved in, huh,

18:26.023 --> 18:28.567
upstairs?

18:28.692 --> 18:30.736
How do you know?

18:30.861 --> 18:33.697
I live next door to you.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.824
Right there.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.127
Just so you know,

18:47.253 --> 18:49.839
I can't be your friend.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.050
Why not?

18:53.175 --> 18:56.387
That's just the way it is.

19:10.943 --> 19:14.321
Well, who said I wanted
to be your friend?

19:17.449 --> 19:19.493
Idiot.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.748
<i>Eat some now,
save some for later</i>

19:24.874 --> 19:27.585
<i>Eat some now, save some
for later...</i>

24:11.785 --> 24:14.163
What am I supposed to do?

24:14.288 --> 24:17.500
Am I supposed to go out there
and do it myself?

24:17.625 --> 24:19.293
Huh?

24:20.794 --> 24:22.671
Huh?

24:22.796 --> 24:25.257
Answer me!

24:34.016 --> 24:36.352
Maybe I'm getting sloppy.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.566
Maybe I want to get caught.

24:47.154 --> 24:49.865
Maybe I'm just tired of this.

25:26.110 --> 25:28.487
Excuse me, everyone.

25:28.612 --> 25:31.198
Let me through here, please.

25:38.122 --> 25:40.666
As some of you may have heard,

25:40.791 --> 25:42.585
there was an incident
last night

25:42.710 --> 25:44.962
and one of your recent
graduates here was killed.

25:46.672 --> 25:48.799
I want to assure you that
we're doing everything possible

25:48.924 --> 25:51.760
to find those responsible
for this tragedy.

25:51.886 --> 25:55.181
But in the meantime
we need you all to be on the lookout

25:55.306 --> 25:57.975
for any suspicious activity,

25:58.100 --> 26:00.811
because your safety

26:00.936 --> 26:03.772
is our number-one concern.

26:32.927 --> 26:36.514
It's you again, huh?

26:36.639 --> 26:39.350
You know, I really want
to be left alone.

26:39.475 --> 26:42.061
- Me too.
- So leave.

26:42.186 --> 26:44.021
You leave.

26:44.146 --> 26:46.690
I've lived here
longer than you.

26:51.487 --> 26:53.989
What is that?

26:55.616 --> 26:58.410
What, this?

27:00.538 --> 27:02.832
It's a Rubik's Cube.

27:04.166 --> 27:06.502
You don't know Rubik's Cube?

27:08.754 --> 27:11.006
Is it a puzzle?

27:12.216 --> 27:14.260
Yeah.

27:14.385 --> 27:16.887
Want to try it?

27:17.012 --> 27:19.723
You can give it back tomorrow.

27:19.849 --> 27:22.184
How do you do it?

27:28.607 --> 27:31.026
You gotta get each side
one color.

27:43.622 --> 27:45.666
Like that.

27:58.762 --> 28:01.724
You smell kind of funny.

28:06.770 --> 28:09.190
Aren't you cold?

28:09.315 --> 28:12.151
I don't really get cold.

28:21.911 --> 28:24.455
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

29:07.414 --> 29:08.999
<i>Let's dance...</i>

29:16.048 --> 29:18.050
<i>Let's dance</i>

29:18.175 --> 29:21.512
<i>To the song they're playing...</i>

29:26.183 --> 29:28.561
Help me.

29:32.398 --> 29:34.441
Hello?

29:36.819 --> 29:38.779
Please.

29:40.823 --> 29:42.950
Help me.

29:57.173 --> 29:59.508
Hello?

30:03.179 --> 30:05.556
Hey there.

30:06.807 --> 30:09.143
Are you okay?

30:09.268 --> 30:11.562
What happened?

30:13.355 --> 30:16.066
I fell.

30:17.109 --> 30:19.195
Yeah?

30:19.320 --> 30:21.655
Well,

30:21.780 --> 30:24.074
can't you get up?

30:24.200 --> 30:26.452
No.

30:26.577 --> 30:28.787
How old are you, sweetheart?

30:28.913 --> 30:31.290
Do you live around here?

30:33.542 --> 30:35.878
I live right here.

30:38.255 --> 30:40.633
Can you carry me?

30:41.842 --> 30:44.303
Sure. Sure, sweetheart.

30:44.428 --> 30:47.723
Just grab on, honey, okay?

30:51.018 --> 30:53.103
- Got it?
- Thank you.

31:46.031 --> 31:49.493
What did you do?
What did you do?!

31:54.165 --> 31:56.000
You did it again!

32:10.014 --> 32:12.349
I have to clean it up!

32:13.601 --> 32:17.104
Bitch! Oh you fucking bitch!

32:44.256 --> 32:46.592
Fuck this shit.

32:46.717 --> 32:48.052
Fuck!

34:38.746 --> 34:41.623
How did you do it?

34:41.748 --> 34:45.168
I just... twisted it.

34:53.092 --> 34:56.054
Do I smell better now?

34:59.141 --> 35:00.643
What's your name?

35:00.768 --> 35:02.770
Abby. What's yours?

35:02.895 --> 35:05.147
I'm Owen.

35:06.607 --> 35:08.108
How old are you?

35:08.234 --> 35:10.528
12, more or less.

35:10.653 --> 35:13.781
What about you?

35:13.906 --> 35:16.158
12 years, eight months
and nine days.

35:16.283 --> 35:18.536
What do you mean,
more or less?

35:18.661 --> 35:19.829
When's your birthday?

35:19.954 --> 35:21.622
I don't know.

35:21.747 --> 35:24.917
You don't know?

35:25.042 --> 35:27.461
Don't you celebrate
your birthday?

35:30.339 --> 35:32.174
Do you get
birthday presents?

35:32.299 --> 35:34.260
No.

35:38.681 --> 35:41.183
Well, you can have this
if you want.

35:41.308 --> 35:43.269
That's okay.

35:43.394 --> 35:45.688
It's yours.

35:49.567 --> 35:51.819
I still don't get
how you did this.

35:51.944 --> 35:53.195
Want me to show you?

35:53.320 --> 35:54.655
Yeah.

36:09.003 --> 36:12.089
I must be gone and live,

36:12.214 --> 36:14.508
or stay and die.

36:16.051 --> 36:19.180
Yon light is not daylight.

36:21.098 --> 36:23.184
I know it, I.

36:25.477 --> 36:28.814
Therefore stay yet;

36:28.939 --> 36:31.150
thou need'st not to be gone.

36:31.275 --> 36:33.944
Oh, let me be taken,

36:34.069 --> 36:36.572
let me be put to death;

36:36.697 --> 36:39.492
I am content,
so thou wilt have it so.

36:39.617 --> 36:42.453
I'll say yon gray is not
the morning's eye...

36:53.506 --> 36:55.925
Shh.

36:59.428 --> 37:01.764
Shh shh.

37:28.958 --> 37:31.377
What were you writing
back there?

37:31.502 --> 37:33.921
What do you mean?

37:34.046 --> 37:36.924
In Cook's class.

37:37.049 --> 37:39.051
Let's see it.

37:40.719 --> 37:42.096
No.

37:42.221 --> 37:44.306
No?

37:50.771 --> 37:52.231
Where is it?

37:54.483 --> 37:56.068
Where is it?

37:56.193 --> 37:58.487
- Ow.
- Show me.

38:00.197 --> 38:02.658
- Jesus Christ, dude.
- What?

38:02.783 --> 38:04.577
You explain that to his mom.

38:09.290 --> 38:11.292
It's okay.

38:13.460 --> 38:16.297
She's not going to tell her mom
on us, is she?

38:16.422 --> 38:18.674
She fell down on the playground,
that's all.

38:18.799 --> 38:21.010
Right?

38:22.636 --> 38:24.638
Right?

38:25.806 --> 38:28.267
Say it, little girl.

38:28.392 --> 38:30.436
Say it!

38:38.110 --> 38:40.446
Come on, man, let's go.

38:42.865 --> 38:45.534
I fell down
on the playground.

38:45.659 --> 38:48.621
You have to be more careful,
okay, honey?

38:51.707 --> 38:54.335
I hate to see my baby
get hurt.

38:56.545 --> 38:58.964
Bless us O Lord
for these Thy gifts

38:59.089 --> 39:00.674
which we are about
to receive.

39:00.799 --> 39:03.802
Please guide and direct us for all
our days and protect us from evil.

39:06.430 --> 39:09.350
Okay look, I made one for you
and one for me.

39:15.314 --> 39:16.690
Are you reading this?

39:16.815 --> 39:19.360
Yeah, it's for school. It's boring.

39:19.485 --> 39:21.195
Come on, look at this.
It's really cool.

39:22.822 --> 39:24.949
We can talk to each other
through the wall.

39:29.453 --> 39:31.872
Can you hear me
through the wall?

39:37.920 --> 39:40.714
Only sometimes.

39:40.840 --> 39:44.093
Did you hear anything
the other night?

39:46.512 --> 39:48.806
Why was your dad so mad?

39:58.148 --> 40:01.402
Where's your mom?
Are your parents divorced?

40:01.527 --> 40:03.362
My mom's dead.

40:09.118 --> 40:12.663
My mom and dad
are getting a divorce.

40:17.585 --> 40:19.003
What happened there?

40:22.923 --> 40:25.551
Just some kids from school.

40:25.676 --> 40:28.888
Where do you go to school anyway?
I've never seen you-

40:29.013 --> 40:30.681
Owen, listen.

40:31.974 --> 40:33.726
What?

40:33.851 --> 40:36.645
You have to hit back.

40:36.770 --> 40:39.064
You have to hit back hard.

40:39.190 --> 40:40.983
I can't.

40:41.108 --> 40:45.154
- There's three of them.
- Then you hit back even harder.

40:48.073 --> 40:49.825
Hit them harder than you dare

40:49.950 --> 40:51.702
and then they'll stop.

40:51.827 --> 40:53.329
What if they hit me back?

40:53.454 --> 40:55.372
You have a knife.

40:55.498 --> 40:59.293
Yeah, and what if that
doesn't stop 'em?

41:02.546 --> 41:04.215
Then I'll help you.

41:06.050 --> 41:08.719
But you're a girl.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.604
I'm a lot stronger
than you think I am.

41:36.288 --> 41:38.499
I have to get in there.

41:38.624 --> 41:40.668
Move.

41:44.296 --> 41:46.090
Move.

41:54.765 --> 41:57.852
<i>Dance the blues...</i>

41:57.648 --> 42:04.706
<i>- hi
- hi</i>

41:59.895 --> 42:01.772
<i>Let's dance...</i>

42:03.899 --> 42:06.193
Mr. Zoric?

42:06.318 --> 42:08.028
Yes, Owen?

42:08.154 --> 42:12.116
I was just wondering about
the after-school strength training.

42:12.241 --> 42:14.285
Can people still sign up?

42:15.828 --> 42:17.621
Would you like to get strong?

42:19.498 --> 42:21.375
Okay.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.920
4:00 you come-
we make you strong.

42:25.045 --> 42:27.464
Cool.

43:08.797 --> 43:11.175
<i>Do you really want to hurt me?</i>

43:11.300 --> 43:14.762
This is Ms. Pac-Man.
Now I'll play.

43:14.887 --> 43:16.805
<i>Do you really want
to make me cry?</i>

43:16.931 --> 43:19.141
And...

43:19.266 --> 43:22.937
...when you get the big thing,
you can eat them.

43:23.062 --> 43:25.105
- Right there.
- Yeah, let me do it.

43:28.192 --> 43:31.612
<i>In my heart the fire's burning...</i>

43:34.740 --> 43:37.576
God, I hate this game.

43:46.877 --> 43:48.587
You want some?

43:48.712 --> 43:50.756
They're really good.
They're my favorite.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.843
They're really really good.

43:53.968 --> 43:56.345
No thanks.

43:58.597 --> 44:00.808
Well, what do you like?

44:00.933 --> 44:02.685
You can have
anything you want.

44:02.810 --> 44:04.687
That's okay.

44:04.812 --> 44:07.147
Oh, okay.

44:07.273 --> 44:09.692
I guess this is it.

44:14.864 --> 44:16.782
Hey.

44:16.907 --> 44:19.952
I guess I could have one.

44:21.745 --> 44:23.289
Really?

44:24.957 --> 44:26.625
Here, it's grape.

44:33.841 --> 44:35.843
I like it.

45:09.919 --> 45:11.962
I'm sorry.

45:24.225 --> 45:27.603
Owen, do you like me?

45:29.438 --> 45:31.440
Yeah.

45:32.566 --> 45:34.235
A lot.

45:38.364 --> 45:41.784
Would you still like me

45:41.909 --> 45:45.079
even if I wasn't a girl?

45:48.249 --> 45:50.376
What do you mean?

45:55.840 --> 45:59.301
I don't know.
I guess.

46:07.017 --> 46:09.520
Why?

46:13.023 --> 46:15.025
No reason.

46:20.906 --> 46:23.117
So where are you guys from?

46:23.242 --> 46:25.161
How come you moved here?

46:25.286 --> 46:27.204
We...

46:27.329 --> 46:30.249
we move around a lot.

46:30.374 --> 46:33.085
Yeah, but why would you
move here?

46:33.210 --> 46:35.462
Nobody moves here.

46:35.588 --> 46:38.841
I hate it here.

46:38.966 --> 46:43.804
Someday I'm gonna get out
and I'll never come back.

46:43.929 --> 46:48.058
The people here...

46:48.184 --> 46:50.311
they're-

46:50.436 --> 46:52.688
they're just stupid.

46:58.652 --> 47:00.696
Owen!

47:00.821 --> 47:02.740
God.

47:02.865 --> 47:05.117
Hang on.

47:08.954 --> 47:10.122
What?

47:10.247 --> 47:12.666
You promised me
you wouldn't leave the courtyard.

47:12.791 --> 47:15.711
Mom, I've been here
the whole time.

47:15.836 --> 47:18.881
Well, come up.
It's time for dinner.

47:20.341 --> 47:22.426
God.

47:42.196 --> 47:44.240
Good night.

47:45.574 --> 47:47.618
Good night.

48:16.147 --> 48:18.566
Are you going out?

48:24.530 --> 48:26.323
Is there a choice?

49:17.041 --> 49:19.335
Please don't see
that boy again.

49:22.838 --> 49:24.840
Okay?

50:46.255 --> 50:48.716
Hey, Jett.

50:48.841 --> 50:50.509
Hey.

50:52.595 --> 50:53.888
Hey, what's up?

50:54.013 --> 50:56.182
Can I get a ride? Keith went over
to see his girlfriend.

50:56.307 --> 50:58.142
Yeah, sure. Get in.

51:10.654 --> 51:12.531
Keith's so fucking
whipped, dude.

51:12.656 --> 51:15.284
I can't even
deal with it anymore.

51:17.745 --> 51:19.872
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to move the seat.

51:19.997 --> 51:22.291
It's in the front.

51:28.672 --> 51:30.549
Hey, thanks for
picking me up, man.

51:30.674 --> 51:32.510
Yeah man, anytime.

51:32.635 --> 51:34.970
Keith would have left me
stuck there all night.

51:55.449 --> 51:57.952
- Do you need gas?
- Yeah.

52:34.947 --> 52:37.074
<i>Home isn't pretty</i>

52:38.409 --> 52:40.870
<i>Ain't no home for me</i>

52:42.079 --> 52:44.248
<i>Home in the darkness</i>

52:45.583 --> 52:47.918
<i>Home on the highway</i>

52:49.128 --> 52:52.131
<i>Home isn't my way</i>

52:52.256 --> 52:54.300
<i>Home I'll never be</i>

52:55.843 --> 52:59.430
<i>Burn out the day</i>

52:59.555 --> 53:02.725
<i>Burn out the night</i>

53:02.850 --> 53:05.102
-  I can't see no reason...
- Fuck! Fuck!

53:05.227 --> 53:07.563
<i>To put up a fight...</i>

53:07.688 --> 53:09.148
Help!

53:10.149 --> 53:11.650
Help!

53:12.902 --> 53:14.069
Thanks.

53:20.659 --> 53:23.829
- What's up, Jett?
- Hey guys, what's going on?

53:23.954 --> 53:25.873
<i>I'm not the one to tell you</i>

53:25.998 --> 53:27.708
<i>What's wrong or what's right...</i>

53:27.833 --> 53:30.961
Help!

53:31.086 --> 53:35.549
<i>I've seen suns that were freezing
and lies that were true</i>

53:38.302 --> 53:40.221
<i>But I'm burnin', I'm burnin'</i>

53:40.346 --> 53:42.014
<i>I'm burnin' for you...</i>

53:45.726 --> 53:47.478
<i>I'm burnin', I'm burnin'</i>

53:47.603 --> 53:50.105
<i>I'm burnin' for you...</i>

53:51.982 --> 53:53.192
What the fuck?

53:53.317 --> 53:56.487
That's my car! Hey, my car!
Stop the car!

54:02.159 --> 54:03.452
What the fuck?

54:09.667 --> 54:11.669
Argh! Argh! Argh!

55:00.301 --> 55:01.719
Greg was in there.

55:01.844 --> 55:03.262
- What?
- He was in the car!

55:03.387 --> 55:06.932
Hey!

55:26.410 --> 55:27.745
Greg.

55:30.748 --> 55:32.082
Greg!

55:36.420 --> 55:39.215
Abby.

56:07.159 --> 56:09.703
An unidentified man
has been arrested in connection

56:09.829 --> 56:12.665
with the recent ritual murder
of a local high school honor student.

56:12.790 --> 56:15.125
The suspect is hospitalized
in critical condition

56:15.251 --> 56:18.712
with severe self-inflicted acid burns
over his face and torso

56:18.838 --> 56:22.299
making it impossible so far for
authorities to determine his identity.

56:24.218 --> 56:27.096
<i>Eat some now, save some for later,
eat some now, save some for later</i>

56:27.221 --> 56:28.597
<i>Now & Lat-</i>

56:28.722 --> 56:32.601
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States,

56:32.726 --> 56:35.104
Ronald Reagan.

56:41.360 --> 56:43.571
Thank you.

56:43.696 --> 56:45.906
Excuse me,

56:46.031 --> 56:48.993
I'm looking for my father.

56:49.118 --> 56:50.995
Is he a patient here?

56:53.164 --> 56:55.749
Yeah, they-

56:55.875 --> 56:58.252
they brought him in.

56:59.628 --> 57:01.547
The police did.

57:01.672 --> 57:04.550
Oh, I see.

57:04.675 --> 57:06.594
Do you know where he is?

57:06.719 --> 57:10.139
Well, he's on the 10th floor,
sweetie, but it's restricted.

57:10.264 --> 57:11.891
Look, why don't we give them
a call and tell them-?

57:12.016 --> 57:14.101
No no, that's okay.

57:20.900 --> 57:23.319
Oh my God, the poor girl.

57:24.528 --> 57:27.239
Sweetie, sweetie!

58:55.411 --> 58:57.538
May I come in?

01:00:06.482 --> 01:00:08.400
His daughter?
When was this?

01:00:08.526 --> 01:00:10.569
Is she still here?

01:00:15.825 --> 01:00:17.827
Well, did she leave
any information,

01:00:17.952 --> 01:00:19.954
a phone number?

01:00:21.497 --> 01:00:24.124
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?

01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:41.350
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:43.602
Somebody help!

01:01:24.226 --> 01:01:25.603
Owen.

01:01:26.645 --> 01:01:28.564
Owen.

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:30.608
Hmm?

01:01:30.733 --> 01:01:33.068
Can I come in?

01:01:34.111 --> 01:01:35.863
No no no, wait wait.

01:01:35.988 --> 01:01:38.407
Don't look at me.

01:01:40.284 --> 01:01:42.536
But you have to say it-

01:01:42.661 --> 01:01:44.455
that I can come in.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.499
You can come in.

01:01:46.624 --> 01:01:47.833
Close your eyes.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:50.252
They're already closed.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.049
How did you get up here?

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:40.302
I flew.

01:02:40.427 --> 01:02:42.680
Yeah, right.

01:02:43.764 --> 01:02:47.351
Hey, you're not
wearing anything.

01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:51.939
And you're freezing.

01:02:52.064 --> 01:02:54.358
Is that gross?

01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:58.237
No.

01:02:59.989 --> 01:03:01.282
Abby...

01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:04.451
Yeah?

01:03:06.996 --> 01:03:09.957
Will you go steady with me?

01:03:10.082 --> 01:03:12.543
What do you mean?

01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:14.545
Will you be my girlfriend?

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:18.382
Owen,

01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:20.050
I'm not a girl.

01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:22.720
You're not a girl?

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:24.513
No.

01:03:24.638 --> 01:03:26.140
What are you?

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:32.146
I'm nothing.

01:03:32.271 --> 01:03:34.857
Oh.

01:03:34.982 --> 01:03:37.818
You know, it's okay
if you don't want to be my girlfriend.

01:03:37.943 --> 01:03:40.029
You don't have to make stuff up.

01:03:45.784 --> 01:03:49.205
Look, can we just keep things
the way they are?

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:52.500
Yeah, sure.

01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:59.632
Well, do you have to do anything

01:03:59.757 --> 01:04:01.634
special

01:04:01.759 --> 01:04:03.677
when you go steady?

01:04:03.802 --> 01:04:06.472
No.

01:04:07.515 --> 01:04:09.308
So everything's the same?

01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:11.018
Yeah.

01:04:13.979 --> 01:04:16.190
Okay.

01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:18.692
We can go steady.

01:04:18.818 --> 01:04:20.736
Really?

01:04:21.779 --> 01:04:23.781
Yeah.

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:51.267
"I must be gone and live
or stay and die."

01:05:27.511 --> 01:05:29.221
Slow down.

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:31.223
Hockey you play
in the center.

01:05:31.348 --> 01:05:33.058
Free skating over that side.

01:05:33.184 --> 01:05:35.519
Now, everyone,
careful of holes in ice.

01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:38.230
Stay away from the holes.

01:05:41.942 --> 01:05:43.903
I hope you've been learning
how to swim,

01:05:44.028 --> 01:05:46.030
'cause today
you're going in.

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:18.604
Go.

01:06:18.729 --> 01:06:20.648
Bring it up
and start passing.

01:06:20.773 --> 01:06:22.733
Pass pass pass.

01:06:27.488 --> 01:06:29.365
Over here.

01:06:38.207 --> 01:06:40.417
What do you think
you're gonna do with that?

01:06:40.543 --> 01:06:42.753
I'm gonna hit you with it

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:44.797
if you try anything.

01:06:44.922 --> 01:06:46.841
Really?

01:06:46.966 --> 01:06:49.343
Wow.

01:06:49.468 --> 01:06:52.096
You know what I think?

01:06:52.221 --> 01:06:55.307
I don't think you're gonna do
a fucking thing.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:07:00.354
I think you're just gonna stand there
like the little girl you are.

01:07:00.479 --> 01:07:04.358
And I'm gonna grab that stick
and ram it right up your ass.

01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:07.444
And then

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.613
you're going swimming.

01:07:11.866 --> 01:07:13.909
I want to hear click-click-click-click.

01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:21.292
Shit, dude. Zoric's right
over there checking us out.

01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:24.587
Let it go.
We'll beat his little ass later.

01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:27.548
Give me the stick.

01:07:30.801 --> 01:07:32.928
Give me the stick.

01:07:33.053 --> 01:07:35.055
Argh!

01:07:39.018 --> 01:07:41.687
Jesus Christ,
are you fucking crazy?

01:07:41.812 --> 01:07:43.272
Hey!

01:07:43.397 --> 01:07:44.523
Hey!

01:07:44.648 --> 01:07:46.817
Boy

01:08:07.755 --> 01:08:10.549
Okay okay, just move.
Please, just move back.

01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:12.218
Move back.

01:08:34.198 --> 01:08:36.826
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't suspend you, Owen.

01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:39.495
Can you think of one?

01:08:41.162 --> 01:08:43.666
Don't you know
what could have happened?

01:08:44.792 --> 01:08:47.502
You seem like a smart kid.

01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:50.130
I just don't want to see you
going down the wrong path.

01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:52.466
He's a good boy.

01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:54.635
He really is.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.221
Hello, is John there?

01:08:58.346 --> 01:09:01.058
Excuse me, this is his wife.
Who is this?

01:09:03.102 --> 01:09:04.895
Hello, Cindy.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.314
Will you please tell John
that I called?

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:10.401
Hey there.

01:09:10.526 --> 01:09:12.236
Is your mom and dad home?

01:09:12.361 --> 01:09:14.279
Yeah.

01:09:14.404 --> 01:09:16.323
Mom!

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:18.450
What?

01:09:20.995 --> 01:09:23.037
- Oh.
- Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

01:09:23.163 --> 01:09:25.624
- What's this about?
- I'm afraid there's been an incident

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:27.792
with one of your neighbors
here in the complex.

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:31.005
So we're just going around, talking to
everybody to see if they know anything.

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.174
What kind of incident?

01:09:35.885 --> 01:09:37.720
Owen, why don't you
go to your room?

01:11:55.274 --> 01:11:57.610
- Sorry, guys.
- Jeez, could you take any longer?

01:11:57.735 --> 01:12:00.029
- I said sorry.
- Come on, let's go play Centipede.

01:12:00.154 --> 01:12:02.448
Man, why are you even
in that class? It's so gay, dude.

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:03.657
Whatever.

01:12:03.782 --> 01:12:05.784
Hey! Stop!

01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:08.954
- How's the cripple?
- Stop! Hey!

01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:12.166
Jesus Christ, dude, watch out.

01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:15.920
Man, that kid whaled on your ass.
Can you still hear me, bro?

01:12:16.045 --> 01:12:17.213
Stop.

01:12:17.338 --> 01:12:18.881
Are you going home?

01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:22.092
No, we're going over
to Mark's.

01:12:22.218 --> 01:12:24.136
Can I borrow your keys?
I forgot mine.

01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:25.596
Please.

01:12:27.348 --> 01:12:29.475
Give me the fucking keys.

01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:35.523
Thanks.

01:12:35.648 --> 01:12:37.650
- See you at home, little girl.
- Hey.

01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:43.447
Shut up.

01:12:43.572 --> 01:12:45.491
- We didn't say anything.
- Shut up.

01:12:50.996 --> 01:12:54.083
Abby, I did it.

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:56.335
You did what?

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.462
They were gonna push me
in the hole in the ice,

01:12:58.587 --> 01:13:01.674
so I got a really big stick and I hit
Kenny in the head really hard.

01:13:01.799 --> 01:13:03.551
He had to go to the hospital.

01:13:03.676 --> 01:13:06.303
I almost got suspended,

01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:07.847
but I didn't.

01:13:07.972 --> 01:13:10.224
What you said-
I stood up to them.

01:13:13.227 --> 01:13:15.855
Owen.

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:17.356
Yeah?

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:38.502
Hey, you want to go somewhere?

01:13:38.627 --> 01:13:40.254
Where?

01:13:58.481 --> 01:14:00.024
It's pretty cool, huh?

01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:01.442
Yeah.

01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:04.069
This kid that used to live
in the building-

01:14:04.195 --> 01:14:06.113
Tommy-

01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:08.949
he would come down here

01:14:09.074 --> 01:14:11.243
and drink and smoke
with his high school friends.

01:14:11.368 --> 01:14:13.621
And when they weren't here,

01:14:13.746 --> 01:14:16.040
he'd play ping-pong with me.

01:14:16.165 --> 01:14:18.501
He was really cool.

01:14:19.627 --> 01:14:21.921
But then he had to move away.

01:14:25.007 --> 01:14:27.343
I kind of like it here.

01:14:29.053 --> 01:14:31.180
It's cool.

01:14:31.305 --> 01:14:33.974
And I don't think any of the adults
know about it-

01:14:34.099 --> 01:14:36.477
it's just us.

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:03.754
So what did you want to do
down here?

01:15:05.422 --> 01:15:07.508
Uh...

01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:10.052
I think I have an idea.

01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:12.012
Close your eyes.

01:15:13.222 --> 01:15:14.723
Keep them closed.

01:15:29.697 --> 01:15:31.699
Let's make a pact.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.619
It only hurts for a second.

01:15:37.454 --> 01:15:38.789
Here.

01:15:59.518 --> 01:16:01.187
Abby?

01:16:18.329 --> 01:16:20.164
Go away.

01:16:37.389 --> 01:16:39.141
Virginia.

01:16:41.143 --> 01:16:43.395
God damn it, Virginia.

01:16:45.356 --> 01:16:47.650
Virginia!

01:16:57.368 --> 01:16:59.870
Get-

01:16:59.995 --> 01:17:02.039
off!

01:17:06.252 --> 01:17:07.628
Hey.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:10.130
Hey.

01:17:16.387 --> 01:17:18.889
Somebody call 911!

01:17:53.174 --> 01:17:55.134
Mom?

01:17:59.847 --> 01:18:01.891
Mom.

01:18:08.397 --> 01:18:10.065
Hello?

01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:12.693
Dad,

01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:14.904
can I talk to you?

01:18:15.029 --> 01:18:17.907
Yeah sure, pal.
What is it?

01:18:18.032 --> 01:18:20.367
Do you-

01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:24.413
do you think

01:18:24.538 --> 01:18:28.083
there's such a thing as evil?

01:18:28.209 --> 01:18:30.586
What?

01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:34.381
What are you talking about, pal?

01:18:36.425 --> 01:18:38.344
Can people be evil?

01:18:38.469 --> 01:18:40.846
Listen, where are you getting
all this stuff?

01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:43.516
Is this from your mother-

01:18:43.641 --> 01:18:46.393
- all her religious crap?
- No.

01:18:46.519 --> 01:18:48.062
You know what, Owen?
Listen listen,

01:18:48.187 --> 01:18:50.648
put your mother on the phone,
okay? I want to talk to her.

01:18:50.773 --> 01:18:52.233
She-

01:18:52.358 --> 01:18:54.276
she's not here.

01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:56.779
All right, she's not-
okay well, please tell her to call.

01:18:56.904 --> 01:19:00.658
Just tell her to call me
when she gets back, all right?

01:19:00.783 --> 01:19:02.827
Okay?

01:19:02.952 --> 01:19:04.036
Dad.

01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:06.997
Owen, I want you to get that crap
out of your head, okay?

01:19:07.122 --> 01:19:08.958
Your mother- she-

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:11.252
listen, look, she has problems.

01:19:11.377 --> 01:19:13.546
And I'm gonna talk to her.

01:19:13.671 --> 01:19:15.840
So I don't want to hear
any more of this.

01:19:15.965 --> 01:19:17.675
All right?

01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:22.471
All right?

01:19:22.596 --> 01:19:23.722
Yeah.

01:19:23.848 --> 01:19:26.100
You have a good night, pal.

01:19:26.225 --> 01:19:28.102
I love you.

01:19:28.227 --> 01:19:30.604
I'm sorry about the last
couple of months, you know?

01:19:30.729 --> 01:19:33.274
But I'll see you soon-
real soon, okay?

01:19:33.399 --> 01:19:36.110
I promise.
Maybe next weekend.

01:19:36.235 --> 01:19:38.279
Mm-hmm.

01:19:41.198 --> 01:19:44.368
I love you.

01:20:06.348 --> 01:20:08.851
Can I come in?

01:20:15.399 --> 01:20:16.984
You have to say it.

01:20:25.075 --> 01:20:27.578
You can come in.

01:20:58.442 --> 01:21:02.363
Are you a vampire?

01:21:08.077 --> 01:21:11.247
I need blood

01:21:11.372 --> 01:21:12.706
to live.

01:21:12.832 --> 01:21:16.335
But how old are you- really?

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.921
12.

01:21:19.046 --> 01:21:21.924
But...

01:21:22.049 --> 01:21:25.177
I've been 12
for a very long time.

01:21:37.106 --> 01:21:39.191
Where's your dad?

01:21:43.404 --> 01:21:45.739
He wasn't my dad.

01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:59.795
What's all this stuff?

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.548
I like puzzles.

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.741
I want to go now.

01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:31.327
I want to go.

01:22:31.452 --> 01:22:34.288
Are you gonna let me?

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:39.502
What are you gonna do to me?

01:22:43.005 --> 01:22:45.466
I told you we couldn't be friends.

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:23.254
Hi. Are you Larry?

01:23:23.379 --> 01:23:25.381
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:23:27.299 --> 01:23:29.802
Sure.

01:23:39.854 --> 01:23:42.106
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:23:42.231 --> 01:23:44.525
How is she doing?

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:47.361
It's been quite a night.

01:23:49.321 --> 01:23:51.782
They had to give her
over six pints of blood.

01:23:51.907 --> 01:23:54.243
We're just waiting to see
if her body rejects it.

01:23:57.955 --> 01:23:59.874
Well, I won't keep you long.

01:23:59.999 --> 01:24:03.627
I just- I need ask you about
the description you gave

01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:06.213
of the little girl.

01:24:06.338 --> 01:24:09.008
You said that she had
long blonde hair,

01:24:09.133 --> 01:24:12.344
she was 12 years old

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:14.513
and she wasn't wearing
any shoes.

01:24:14.638 --> 01:24:15.973
- Right?
- That's right.

01:24:16.098 --> 01:24:18.559
Have you ever seen this man?

01:24:26.025 --> 01:24:27.943
He's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:30.321
Looks like a guy
from our building.

01:24:30.446 --> 01:24:32.698
Did he have a daughter

01:24:32.823 --> 01:24:34.658
like the girl you described?

01:24:34.783 --> 01:24:36.827
I don't know.
I've only seen him a few times.

01:24:39.705 --> 01:24:43.042
Why? Do you think this has
something to do with your murder case?

01:24:43.167 --> 01:24:45.544
Maybe. We're starting to think
that some of them might be involved

01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:48.088
- in some sort of Satanic cult.
- What?

01:24:48.214 --> 01:24:50.090
We found another body
a few days ago-

01:24:50.216 --> 01:24:52.760
same MO,
victim completely drained of blood.

01:24:52.885 --> 01:24:55.137
There were two bite marks,
small ones,

01:24:55.262 --> 01:24:57.515
on the victim's neck-
just like a little child's.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.683
Jesus Christ.

01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:12.321
Oh!

01:25:21.747 --> 01:25:25.209
- Virginia, Virginia.
- Stay back. Stay back.

01:25:34.051 --> 01:25:36.053
Oh- mm.

01:25:46.063 --> 01:25:48.065
We're told one patient
was killed in the fire

01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:51.735
as well as one hospital nurse.
The five-alarm fire started

01:25:51.861 --> 01:25:54.613
on the eighth floor of the hospital
and took most of the day

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.448
for crews to contain.

01:25:56.574 --> 01:25:59.160
The official cause is still
under investigation.

01:26:04.874 --> 01:26:07.918
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:17.136 --> 01:26:20.681
You have to invite me in

01:26:20.806 --> 01:26:22.725
to your home.

01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:25.978
What if I don't?

01:26:26.103 --> 01:26:28.022
Why can't you just come in?

01:26:28.147 --> 01:26:30.608
Is there something in your way?

01:27:24.286 --> 01:27:25.579
No no no, stop stop.

01:27:25.704 --> 01:27:28.374
You can come in.
You can come in.

01:27:37.883 --> 01:27:40.845
What was that?

01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:43.639
I don't know.

01:27:44.974 --> 01:27:48.811
I just know this is what happens
if you don't invite me in.

01:27:52.148 --> 01:27:54.316
What if I didn't say anything?

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:59.280
Would you have kept bleeding?

01:27:59.405 --> 01:28:01.782
Would you have died?

01:28:03.409 --> 01:28:05.828
I knew you wouldn't let me.

01:29:03.093 --> 01:29:06.680
<i>We had broken up for good
just an hour before</i>

01:29:06.806 --> 01:29:10.392
<i>Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh
oh-oh</i>

01:29:10.518 --> 01:29:13.979
<i>And now I'm staring at the bodies
as they're dancing 'cross the floor</i>

01:29:14.104 --> 01:29:17.441
<i>Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh
oh-oh...</i>

01:29:17.566 --> 01:29:20.402
You can borrow one of my mom's
old dresses if you want.

01:29:20.528 --> 01:29:23.364
<i>Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh
oh-oh</i>

01:29:23.489 --> 01:29:27.701
<i>It was the same old song
with the melancholy sound</i>

01:29:27.827 --> 01:29:30.996
<i>Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh
oh-oh</i>

01:29:32.498 --> 01:29:36.293
<i>They don't write 'em
like that anymore</i>

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:45.010
<i>They just don't write 'em
like that anymore</i>

01:29:45.136 --> 01:29:48.180
<i>We'd been living together
for a million years</i>

01:29:48.305 --> 01:29:49.640
<i>Oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh
oh-oh...</i>

01:29:49.765 --> 01:29:51.684
Hello?

01:29:53.018 --> 01:29:54.311
Owen.

01:29:56.188 --> 01:29:58.649
I'm in here.
I'll be right there.

01:30:39.064 --> 01:30:41.859
Los Alamos weather at 6:20 AM.

01:30:41.984 --> 01:30:45.404
Calm and cold this morning
with temperatures around 24°,

01:30:45.529 --> 01:30:49.241
then picking up this afternoon
bringing snow flurries.

01:30:49.366 --> 01:30:52.620
We're expecting 6-12" of snow
in the next 24 hours...

01:31:49.343 --> 01:31:51.053
"Hi Owen. Good morning.

01:31:51.178 --> 01:31:53.264
I am in the bathroom.
Please do not come in.

01:31:53.389 --> 01:31:56.142
Want to hang out with me
again tonight?

01:31:56.267 --> 01:31:58.144
I really like you.

01:31:58.269 --> 01:32:01.355
Love, Abby."

01:32:33.637 --> 01:32:36.140
Hello?

01:32:37.308 --> 01:32:39.018
Police department.
Open the door.

01:32:40.352 --> 01:32:43.230
Open the door!

01:32:52.948 --> 01:32:54.950
Police officer!

01:36:33.002 --> 01:36:36.589
No no, stop!

01:36:36.714 --> 01:36:37.882
Jesus.

01:38:31.871 --> 01:38:34.248
Owen, I have to go away.

01:41:16.494 --> 01:41:18.829
Ah, speak of the devil.
There he is.

01:41:18.954 --> 01:41:20.080
Hi.

01:41:20.206 --> 01:41:22.458
Today we start in pool, okay?

01:41:22.583 --> 01:41:24.585
Okay.

01:41:33.511 --> 01:41:35.095
Hey Owen.

01:41:35.221 --> 01:41:37.515
Oh, hi.

01:41:46.398 --> 01:41:47.566
He's here.

01:41:56.408 --> 01:41:58.577
Come on, hurry up.

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.005
Just like we did before,
kick, then in water-

01:42:10.131 --> 01:42:12.633
one-two-three breathe,
one-two-three breathe.

01:42:12.758 --> 01:42:15.010
Kick kick. Good.

01:42:15.136 --> 01:42:17.471
One-two-three breathe.
Yes.

01:42:17.596 --> 01:42:19.682
One-two-three breathe.

01:42:19.807 --> 01:42:21.684
Mr. Zoric, there's a fire.

01:42:21.809 --> 01:42:24.103
- What?
- Out back.

01:42:24.228 --> 01:42:25.896
Owen, I'll be right back.

01:42:27.481 --> 01:42:29.483
- Where?
- At the dumpsters.

01:42:52.923 --> 01:42:54.842
Everybody out of the pool.

01:42:54.967 --> 01:42:57.470
Move. Come on, get out.

01:42:57.595 --> 01:42:59.096
Out.

01:42:59.221 --> 01:43:01.140
I said everybody get out.

01:43:01.265 --> 01:43:03.809
- Get out of the pool.
- Owen!

01:43:05.769 --> 01:43:07.688
Owen!

01:43:07.813 --> 01:43:10.691
Owen!

01:43:18.073 --> 01:43:20.284
What are you gonna do
with that?

01:43:22.119 --> 01:43:24.788
No no no no.
Stop!

01:43:28.626 --> 01:43:31.587
No no. No! Help!

01:43:31.712 --> 01:43:33.714
Stop! Guys, stop!

01:43:35.382 --> 01:43:37.301
No. Stop. Stop.

01:43:37.426 --> 01:43:40.221
Stop! Stop!

01:43:40.346 --> 01:43:44.642
Oh! Somebody! Ow!

01:43:44.767 --> 01:43:46.644
Stop!

01:43:46.769 --> 01:43:49.438
Grab his arms.
Get his arms.

01:43:49.563 --> 01:43:51.315
No no, stop it.

01:44:16.048 --> 01:44:18.300
We're gonna have
a little contest, okay?

01:44:18.425 --> 01:44:20.719
You stay underwater for...

01:44:21.887 --> 01:44:24.640
three minutes.

01:44:24.765 --> 01:44:27.852
If you can do it,
I'll just give you a little nick-

01:44:27.977 --> 01:44:30.187
on your cheek.

01:44:30.312 --> 01:44:32.481
But if you can't,

01:44:32.606 --> 01:44:34.733
I'm gonna poke out
one of your eyes.

01:44:34.859 --> 01:44:37.862
Got it?
An eye for an ear.

01:44:37.987 --> 01:44:40.072
Three minutes.

01:44:40.197 --> 01:44:42.867
You'd better take a deep breath.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.604
- Okay, Jimmy.
- Shut up.

01:45:20.988 --> 01:45:23.032
- Dude, come on.
- I said shut up!

01:45:23.157 --> 01:45:26.744
What the f-?

01:45:26.869 --> 01:45:29.538
What the fuck is this? Argh!

01:45:29.663 --> 01:45:33.292
Oh my God, Jimmy! Jimmy!

01:45:34.668 --> 01:45:37.588
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:45:38.923 --> 01:45:41.675
No no no no!

01:45:50.851 --> 01:45:53.312
No no.

01:47:21.609 --> 01:47:23.944
Excuse me,
can I see your ticket?

01:47:35.831 --> 01:47:38.250
Is that trunk yours?

01:47:50.918 --> 01:47:54.511
<i>hi</i>

01:47:59.591 --> 01:48:04.528
<i>hug and kiss</i>

01:48:14.578 --> 01:48:17.957
<i>Eat some now,
save some for later</i>

01:48:21.585 --> 01:48:24.922
<i>Eat some now,
save some for later.</i>

01:48:25.305 --> 01:48:31.821
