Night Dick: HANG ON, KID.
I've GOT YOU.
WHO ARE YOU?

19:33.399 --> 19:36.666
Detective Richard knight
was just an ordinary cop

until the night the mob
gunned him down

19:39.536 --> 19:40.801
and left him for dead.

That was the night he took
the law into his own hands.

the New York chapter

19:53.778 --> 19:56.744
will put its full support
behind the new guild?
