- <i>Nomad Droids</i> -

00:10.552 --> 00:15.474
{fad(500,1000)}Who's the more foolish, the fool
or the fool who follows him?

00:15.599 --> 00:17.197
/

00:17.322 --> 00:18.570
<i>Home world bound!</i>

00:18.695 --> 00:21.189
<i>On a peaceful relief mission,
to the planet Aleen,</i>

00:21.432 --> 00:23.439
<i>R2-D2 and C-3PO,</i>

00:23.735 --> 00:27.223
<i>were caught up in an adventure
beyond their comprehension.</i>

00:27.785 --> 00:29.725
<i>After finally resolving the crisis</i>

00:29.988 --> 00:32.698
<i>and being taken to Jedi master
Adi Gallia's cruiser,</i>

00:33.066 --> 00:35.835
<i>they now head home
toward the safety of the republic,</i>

00:35.960 --> 00:38.162
<i>hoping to avoid a separatist attack.</i>

00:38.763 --> 00:41.520
And, mistress padme,
you would not believe

00:41.645 --> 00:45.145
the adventures artoo and I had
on that troubled planet of aleen.

00:45.450 --> 00:49.182
We have been in the most absurd
situations I could never compute.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.794
<i>Well, I told you, threepio,
it's a big universe out there,</i>

00:52.919 --> 00:55.054
<i>beyond the few million
planets you know.</i>

00:55.496 --> 00:57.336
And obviously, for the most part,

00:57.461 --> 00:58.909
Quite uncivilized.

00:59.304 --> 01:02.395
I hope never to end up
on a mission of that nature again.

01:02.721 --> 01:03.512
<i>Good.</i>

01:03.637 --> 01:06.171
I need you here to supervise
the senatorial banquet.

01:06.444 --> 01:08.651
It was pushed up
and is only two days away.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.956
They hit the main reactor.
Prepare to evacuate.

01:26.064 --> 01:28.516
<i>Non-essential personnel,
evacuate immediately.</i>

01:31.010 --> 01:32.344
Did you hear that?

01:32.469 --> 01:34.314
We've got to get out of here.

01:42.072 --> 01:43.394
It's general grievous!

01:47.263 --> 01:48.649
Artoo, where are you going?

01:50.905 --> 01:52.695
We need to find an escape pod.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.073
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

01:55.198 --> 01:57.215
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

02:03.256 --> 02:05.303
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

02:11.026 --> 02:13.567
R2-D2, get down from there at once.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.468
This is not an escape pod.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.698
Well, if there's nothing better,
I suppose it will just have to do.

02:19.823 --> 02:22.099
I'm sure I will live to regret it.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.815
Artoo you should know I have total
confidence in your skills as a pilot,

02:37.940 --> 02:40.269
provided you can avoid
these star cruisers.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.577
Up mind!

02:45.738 --> 02:47.666
Avoid them the other way!

02:55.455 --> 02:58.177
Artoo, do something.
Get us out of here!

03:12.526 --> 03:14.112
They are behind us!

03:17.061 --> 03:18.170
We've been hit!

03:36.842 --> 03:39.602
Right on target, well done, artoo!

03:41.293 --> 03:42.299
Oh, no!

03:42.424 --> 03:44.825
The reactor was hit.
It's shutting down.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.226
We'll disintegrate for sure!

04:04.657 --> 04:06.695
Fixable?
This scrap pile?

04:07.278 --> 04:10.471
Without the proper tools,
this ship is utterly useless.

04:10.596 --> 04:13.728
I suppose we could get out
and have a look around.

04:18.028 --> 04:19.031
Oh, really.

04:19.156 --> 04:21.007
You see, not even a ladder.

04:21.442 --> 04:22.887
Utterly useless! Utterly.

04:24.743 --> 04:26.142
Look, look!
Over there!

04:26.460 --> 04:27.545
Intruders!

04:28.724 --> 04:30.619
- It's shiny.
- It's shiny!

04:31.542 --> 04:32.768
Did you hear that?

04:41.984 --> 04:44.615
Whoever you are,
please note that my counterpart here

04:44.740 --> 04:47.494
is programmed in 47 schools
of self-defense.

04:57.021 --> 04:58.756
There.
I've frightened them off.

05:09.217 --> 05:11.578
Fear not Artoo,
just little creatures.

05:11.703 --> 05:13.312
Can't possibly damage us.

05:31.477 --> 05:32.989
Get the big Hay-Zu.

05:33.114 --> 05:34.707
He'll know what to do.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.593
{PUB}May I say that,

05:41.718 --> 05:45.970
this is no way to treat
friendly visitors to your planet.

05:46.552 --> 05:50.265
The big Hay-Zu says
there are no friendly visitors.

05:50.604 --> 05:52.893
This hay-zu doesn't sound
very reasonable.

05:53.330 --> 05:56.284
We do what he says...
Whatever he says...

05:56.903 --> 05:58.315
For our own good.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.092
Your own good?

06:03.343 --> 06:05.984
He sends our children
to fight his wars...

06:06.622 --> 06:07.992
The lucky ones.

06:08.416 --> 06:10.828
What does he do to the unlucky ones?

06:26.716 --> 06:29.195
So, you are the intruders?

06:29.597 --> 06:30.692
Intruders?

06:30.986 --> 06:33.311
Hardly, your... Worshipfulness.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.308
- We are...
- On this planet,

06:35.572 --> 06:38.147
things are what Hay-Zu says they are.

06:39.885 --> 06:42.015
- Quiet, artoo.
- What's this?

06:42.247 --> 06:45.487
Your friend challenges
big Hay-Zu's authority?

06:45.746 --> 06:49.709
Sir, my disagreeable friend here
means no disrespect.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.152
We are just trying to get back
to our home planet.

06:53.568 --> 06:56.969
But our ship is damaged,
and I fear repaired or not,

06:57.094 --> 06:58.639
that further travel in it,

06:58.764 --> 07:01.211
might not result
in our arrival there unscathed.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.642
That's the chance
you'll have to take.

07:03.862 --> 07:06.427
Now, get off my planet
while I'm in a good mood!

07:06.552 --> 07:09.033
Or I'll have you dismembered
and sold for scrap.

07:09.241 --> 07:10.179
Free them!

07:24.079 --> 07:26.208
Big talk for a small droid.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.841
Artoo, have your senses frozen?

07:28.966 --> 07:31.514
I am not going to "let you at him".

07:31.743 --> 07:33.474
In fact, I'm going to switch you off

07:33.599 --> 07:36.160
before you cause
an intergalactic incident.

07:48.213 --> 07:49.865
Dead! He's dead!

07:50.240 --> 07:52.137
The big Hay-Zu is dead!

07:52.415 --> 07:54.199
You must understand,

07:54.324 --> 07:57.309
this was an accident,
a terrible accident.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.163
He's dead! He's dead!

07:59.288 --> 08:01.188
The big Hay-Zu is dead!

08:01.535 --> 08:02.650
He's dead!

08:02.863 --> 08:03.836
He's dead!

08:03.961 --> 08:05.947
The big Hay-Zu is dead!

08:19.713 --> 08:20.615
Gold one!

08:21.063 --> 08:23.263
We have a proposition.

08:23.810 --> 08:26.630
We wish you not to leave
but for you to stay,

08:27.162 --> 08:28.424
as our new leader.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.352
A lot you know,
you overstuffed barrel of bolts.

08:33.477 --> 08:34.802
I could be a leader.

08:34.927 --> 08:37.400
I am honored by your consideration.

08:38.264 --> 08:40.727
But you should choose a leader
from among your own.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.135
None of us has killed Hay-Zu.

08:43.418 --> 08:45.566
None of us have earned the title.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.811
Terminating the big one
does not anoint me leader.

08:49.264 --> 08:50.779
You must choose.

08:51.726 --> 08:55.701
Who are the three smartest,
most intelligent, most understanding,

08:55.869 --> 08:57.484
most compassionate?

09:03.772 --> 09:07.300
You should choose a leader
from among these three.

09:07.857 --> 09:10.026
Who thinks he should be leader?

09:12.614 --> 09:13.969
And this young lady?

09:16.018 --> 09:17.508
Or lastly, him?

09:20.725 --> 09:24.410
Congratulations.
You are now a democracy.

09:24.934 --> 09:27.326
- I got more votes than he did!
- No, you did not!

09:27.451 --> 09:29.139
Sit down! It was me!

09:30.082 --> 09:31.403
No, that is not true!

09:37.100 --> 09:39.536
I heartily agree.
Is the ship ready?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.955
Then we'll just have to risk it
and leave them,

09:43.080 --> 09:46.168
to build their
happy democracy on their own.

09:46.511 --> 09:49.451
- I want another vote!
- Down with democracy!

10:11.789 --> 10:15.656
Yes, I'm reading the gauges.
I have nothing to do but read gauges.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.116
Why? What do the gauges say?

10:19.818 --> 10:22.615
Running out of power?
The ship and us too?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.874
{pos(190,220)}I knew we should never have left
the jedi cruiser.

10:27.145 --> 10:28.335
Another planet?

10:42.559 --> 10:46.273
According to system coordinates,
this is Balnab.

10:46.587 --> 10:51.105
A stellar remnant in its emerging
stages of organic development.

10:51.431 --> 10:54.431
I've heard terrible stories
about these primitive planets.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.837
I don't want imagine,

11:00.962 --> 11:03.513
what is beginning to swim
in their primordial soups.

11:05.754 --> 11:09.710
I know we have to find power,
but do we have to find it out there?

11:13.585 --> 11:14.528
Afraid?

11:14.653 --> 11:16.425
Of course I'm not afraid.

11:20.432 --> 11:21.436
I am now.

11:21.561 --> 11:25.747
Quickly, see if your scanners
can find a viable power source.

11:35.283 --> 11:36.682
Yes, me too.

11:38.679 --> 11:40.939
Life forms?
What kind?

11:49.401 --> 11:53.520
They appear to be humanoid
and completely devoid of intelligence.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.714
Artoo, make a dash for it!

12:11.615 --> 12:14.038
- What are they?
- Bring them.

12:14.335 --> 12:15.567
The leader will know.

12:15.987 --> 12:17.132
Another leader?

12:17.924 --> 12:20.651
I do hope this one
is more understanding.

12:29.979 --> 12:32.675
{PUB}My fault?
I should have known.

12:42.976 --> 12:46.404
<i>Who dares come to my land?</i>

12:48.045 --> 12:50.457
Just two wandering droids,

12:50.670 --> 12:52.687
searching to find their home.

12:53.098 --> 12:54.294
<i>Droids?</i>

12:54.639 --> 12:57.223
<i>What are droids?</i>

12:57.902 --> 13:01.803
Well, kind sir, droids are
mechanical beings possessing

13:01.928 --> 13:04.157
artificial intelligence,
designed to make it...

13:04.325 --> 13:05.604
<i>Silence!</i>

13:05.729 --> 13:07.560
At once, sir, your sirness.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.038
Being silent is one
of my specialties.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.875
<i>Who dares to bring these,</i>

13:14.128 --> 13:17.736
<i>nonliving things before me?</i>

13:17.861 --> 13:20.057
It was I who brought them.

13:20.361 --> 13:21.800
I thought they....

13:23.976 --> 13:25.285
How unfortunate!

13:25.674 --> 13:29.668
<i>No one thinks here but me!</i>

13:31.523 --> 13:32.687
Artoo, be quiet.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.489
This situation calls for my most
delicate diplomatic skills.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.092
Please excuse my insolent friend,

13:39.217 --> 13:40.986
Your eminence-ness-ness.

13:41.610 --> 13:47.284
- But I know a holographic image...
- <i>I know not of your blasphemy!</i>

13:55.288 --> 13:58.338
Incorrect word in your native tongue,

13:58.463 --> 14:00.530
but it is obvious
that you are not real.

14:00.655 --> 14:01.736
Not real?

14:02.101 --> 14:04.325
<i>I'll show you not real!</i>

14:10.688 --> 14:12.872
Hey, what are you doing back here?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.306
<i>I said,</i>

14:15.630 --> 14:19.472
<i>What are you doing back here?</i>

14:20.222 --> 14:21.568
Back where?

14:23.237 --> 14:24.919
Help you? We're not...

14:29.683 --> 14:31.081
We're not gonna help you.

14:31.206 --> 14:34.811
We work hard to keep these
mindless organics enslaved.

14:34.936 --> 14:38.293
And if you want to order someone
around, get your own organics.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.320
Oh, yeah?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.672
And just how is an astromech unit,

14:43.797 --> 14:46.510
going to make
our loyal subjects rebel?

15:03.155 --> 15:04.412
Hey, get him!

15:06.763 --> 15:07.675
Again.

15:14.759 --> 15:17.774
It's time to leave,
but we still need to recharge.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.266
Here they come.
They're coming for us!

15:21.582 --> 15:23.123
We're done for!

15:24.035 --> 15:25.809
There goes my empire!

15:26.421 --> 15:27.658
Run for it!

15:45.776 --> 15:48.230
It's all your fault, artoo,
all your fault.

15:48.474 --> 15:50.207
Whatever will we do now?

15:54.562 --> 15:56.580
Artoo, I'm talking to you.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.866
Please don't mumble.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.093
Artoo, you're almost out of power.

16:06.732 --> 16:07.924
Here. Rest.

16:11.343 --> 16:12.023
Me?

16:12.347 --> 16:16.330
Have 1.723% left in my power core.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.353
I thought for sure you would have
figured something out by now.

16:20.852 --> 16:23.025
You're usually so good
at that sort of thing.

16:28.359 --> 16:30.508
Artoo, don't leave me.

16:30.903 --> 16:31.698
Please,

16:32.302 --> 16:33.903
rest, my friend.

16:35.294 --> 16:38.415
I will be joining you soon...

17:00.812 --> 17:03.734
A republic Y-Wing is great prize.

17:04.365 --> 17:06.665
Do you think there are
any Jedi around?

17:06.940 --> 17:08.188
Don't worry.

17:08.313 --> 17:11.671
We'll be taking off before anyone
realizes we've landed.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.732
What have we here?

17:14.259 --> 17:17.368
Looks like two droids are
run out of power.

17:18.135 --> 17:19.523
Lookee, lookee here.

17:21.939 --> 17:23.426
Come to papa.

17:23.551 --> 17:24.663
Here ya go!

17:29.187 --> 17:30.829
This should be a fun one.

17:40.229 --> 17:42.051
What... Rescue us?

17:42.176 --> 17:43.841
Master... Anakin?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.145
Artoo!

17:46.703 --> 17:48.041
You're recharged!

17:48.720 --> 17:50.088
I'm recharged.

17:50.524 --> 17:51.546
We survived.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.026
Where are we?

17:54.878 --> 17:55.810
Pirates?

18:10.946 --> 18:12.870
What are they cheering for?

18:21.218 --> 18:23.083
Goodness gracious me!

18:23.630 --> 18:25.231
Soon it will be us.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.033
Oh my stars!

18:45.949 --> 18:49.809
General, we've come across
what appears to be a pirate ship.

18:50.428 --> 18:52.984
Use that ship for target practice.

18:53.521 --> 18:54.798
Open fire!

18:55.332 --> 18:57.423
All forward cannons, open fire!

18:57.737 --> 18:58.842
Battle stations!

19:07.067 --> 19:08.607
Go get him, artoo!

19:26.473 --> 19:29.292
We'll never get back to the ship!

19:41.931 --> 19:43.181
We surrender!

19:44.069 --> 19:45.809
Where did you come from?

19:46.104 --> 19:47.670
They must be pirate droids.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.119
Pirate droids?

19:49.494 --> 19:50.814
You're under arrest.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.950
Pirate droids?
We're not pirate droids.

19:53.075 --> 19:54.666
We are part of the republic...

19:55.629 --> 19:57.503
Oh, yes, we are pirate droids.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.649
{pos(190,220)}That is what we thought.

19:59.963 --> 20:03.811
{pos(190,220)}Send them off to the incinerator room
with the rest og the pirate scum.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.869
{pos(190,220)}The incinerator room?

20:06.335 --> 20:07.026
{pos(190,220)}Yes.

20:07.433 --> 20:11.467
You will be melted down for
general grievous' war machine.

20:17.139 --> 20:18.416
This is terrible.

21:00.815 --> 21:03.927
This trip has been nothing
but calamity all the way.

21:07.324 --> 21:09.604
Thanks for the rescue, master Plo.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.671
General grievous has fled.

21:15.026 --> 21:15.969
Very good.

21:16.303 --> 21:18.029
Finish off the remaining droids.

21:18.154 --> 21:19.397
We are republic.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.710
We belong to senator amidala.

21:21.835 --> 21:23.199
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

21:23.747 --> 21:25.380
I can't believe it.

21:25.630 --> 21:28.022
You know these droids,
commander Wolffe?

21:28.252 --> 21:29.204
Yes, sir.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.319
We transported them
to master Gallia's ship

21:31.444 --> 21:33.082
after we left the planet Aleen.

21:33.491 --> 21:35.234
Yes, commander wolffe.

21:35.821 --> 21:37.308
How have you been, sir?

21:37.433 --> 21:39.505
We have been on quite an adventure.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.735
Well, I'm certain Wolffe
would love to hear about it.

21:43.626 --> 21:44.916
Actually, sir...

21:45.303 --> 21:47.546
Excellent.
It's a long story.

21:48.222 --> 21:49.669
And you won't believe it.

21:49.794 --> 21:52.111
- Sir, excuse me...
- I can hardly believe it myself.

21:52.693 --> 21:53.959
It all started...
