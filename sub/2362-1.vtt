[ Boy Narrating ]
My brother keeps a human head
in his closet.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.428
Every few days
it's a new head.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.700
Usually, they are black women.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.703
But one time he had
a white man's head in there.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.778
I was going bowling
with my friend David one day...

01:17.811 --> 01:19.680
And I needed
to borrow Steve's ball.

01:22.250 --> 01:26.587
He wasn't home,
so I took it
without asking permission.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.489
That's a big no-no.

01:30.658 --> 01:34.728
When I opened the bag
at the bowling alley,
I almost cried.

01:34.762 --> 01:39.700
I didn't tell anyone about it,
and I used David's ball
instead.

01:39.733 --> 01:45.038
I lied and said
the one I brought
was too heavy for me.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.874
I'm surprised
they couldn't smell it.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.549
It's another black
woman's head,

02:28.582 --> 02:30.584
And her hair
has been ripped out.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.822
I've seen lots of
horror movies,

02:34.855 --> 02:39.627
And the heads in those things
don't come close to looking
like the real thing.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.696
I can't explain
what it feels like
to hold one of them.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.967
At one point
it had thoughts and feelings...

02:47.000 --> 02:49.503
And it kissed somebody
it loved.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.475
Now it's just a bloody head
in a bowling ball bag.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.579
I hope I don't end up that way.

03:05.152 --> 03:09.189
If Steve found out
I was in his room,
he'd probably kill me too.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.859
I worry about him
finding out.

03:11.892 --> 03:15.563
What if I put
the head back in the bag
facing the wrong direction?

03:16.997 --> 03:20.401
If he's a killer,
he probably thinks
about things like that,

03:20.434 --> 03:22.536
Because he's crazy.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.340
The first person
he would blame would be me.

03:26.374 --> 03:30.177
Big brothers
blame little brothers
for everything.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.212

that's just the way it is.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.825
I was upstairs.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.497
What are you
working on?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.932
Me and David are making
a graphic novel.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.501
Like a comic book?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.436
David said
they are graphic novels.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.204
What are
graphic novels?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.640
Does that mean
that they're
really graphic?

03:59.673 --> 04:02.576
It just means
they use pictures.

04:02.610 --> 04:06.714
Anyway, me and David
have each been working
on a superhero.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.081

Here's mine...

And here's Roach man.
David drew him.
Hmm.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.224
We take turns
drawing the backgrounds.
Tonight I get to draw the blood.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.858

What?

04:18.892 --> 04:22.596
I wish you could get
interested in things
that weren't so horrible.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.598
You know those movies
used to keep you up
at night.

Hi to you too.

I said hi.

Get your things off the table
before your dad gets home.

05:20.087 --> 05:23.957
[ Marty Narrating ]
I wish my mom wouldn't worry
about what I watched or drew.

05:23.991 --> 05:28.362
The only reason she cares
is because of a picture
I drew in art class last year.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.431
My teacher freaked out
about it,

05:30.464 --> 05:33.967
So Mom had to come to school
and talk about it.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.204
I guess some people
are afraid that if a kid
watches horror movies,

05:37.237 --> 05:39.907
He'll grow up to be
a killer or a psycho.

05:39.940 --> 05:44.111
But I'm not a violent person.
I don't even like killing bugs.

05:44.144 --> 05:48.449
I get good grades and I do
what people tell me to, so
they just shouldn't worry.

05:48.482 --> 05:53.754
Dad tells Mom all boys
are interested in horror movies
and graphic novels.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.658
He says it's normal,
and that I'll grow
out of it someday.

05:57.691 --> 06:02.195
But if that's true,
then I don't wanna
ever grow up.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.464
Not ever.

Hmm? Sorry.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.855
That must have been
one heck of a daydream.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.492
What if we went bowling
this weekend?

09:19.526 --> 09:21.528
I have to work

Maybe next weekend.

Everyone's working overtime.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.565

Well, I guess it's
just you and me, kiddo.

Can we go see
a movie?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.041

a horror movie.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.076
Let's try something different
for a change.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.212
I'm sure we can find
something family-oriented.

There's oil
on the driveway again.
