to look at her.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.795
Are you looking at her?

11:35.200 --> 11:36.759
And if you are looking at her,

11:36.960 --> 11:39.395

that she is guilty

11:39.600 --> 11:42.991
of this heinous crime

Tate, you're in luck.
I like it.

You like it?
I like it.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.193
Oh, that's terrific.
What exactly do you
like about it?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.631
It's almost impossible.

against her.

I love it.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.071
Well, I'm, uh, flattered,
I guess.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.511
Well, we'll arrange
to meet her the day
after tomorrow...

12:28.720 --> 12:30.712
Don't you think
we should discuss
your fee? I hear that...

12:30.920 --> 12:34.152
I hate to talk money,
Tate. I hate it.
I see.

12:34.360 --> 12:38.957
Well, perhaps you could
write it down on a piece of paper.

12:39.160 --> 12:42.073
A ballpark figure,
just to give me an estimate.

You could buy
a small nation with this.

I don't have to recite
my record to you,
do I, Tate?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.760
You remember the Robinson case?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.474
She was seen
pulling the trigger.

There were pictures
of her chuckling
over the dead body.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.276

13:09.480 --> 13:12.996
I not only got her off,
I got her damages
from his estate.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.951
I know that you're the best.
I mean, I know that.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.992
That's why I'm here, uh.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.954
It's just that, uh,
you see, I've had to
mortgage the house

13:21.160 --> 13:23.356
to raise the bail for Jessica,

13:23.560 --> 13:25.756
and, well,
things are kind of
tight right now.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.270
It's okay, Tate.
I understand.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.597
There are other lawyers,
I'm not the only one.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.235
I'm the best,
but I'm not the only one.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.000
So if your wife isn't worth
the additional money, it's...

13:36.200 --> 13:38.112
I could give you
a cheque for
part of it now

13:38.320 --> 13:40.118
and then in a few days,
I could give you...

13:40.320 --> 13:43.552

A handshake is enough
for me. I trust you.

gonna move out and

his wife will be gone,
