00:01.900 --> 00:04.600
I don't want to watch <i>Saturn 3</i>.
<i>Deep Space Nine</i> is better.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.100
How is <i>Deep Space Nine</i>
better than <i>Saturn 3</i> ?

00:09.300 --> 00:11.800
Simple subtraction
will tell you it's six better.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.800
Compromise. Watch <i>Babylon 5</i>.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.700
In what sense is that a compromise?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.200
Well, five is partway
between three... Never mind.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.100
I'll tell you what.
How about we go rock-paper-scissors?

00:27.700 --> 00:28.800
I don't think so.

00:29.100 --> 00:32.000
Anecdotal evidence suggests
that in the game of rock-paper-scissors,

00:32.200 --> 00:35.700
players familiar with each other
will tie 75 to 80% of the time

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
due to the limited number
of outcomes.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.200
I suggest
rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.200
- What?
- It's very simple.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.500
Scissors cuts paper.
Paper covers rock.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.000
Rock crushes lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.000
Spock smashes scissors.
Scissors decapitates lizard.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.400
Lizard eats paper.
Paper disproves Spock.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.900
Spock vaporizes rock.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.000
And as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

01:04.099 --> 01:05.600
Okay, I think I got it.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.200
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock!

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
Hello, boys.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.100
Ahoy, matey.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.300
Noticed the eye patch, did you?

01:25.400 --> 01:29.000
It's all part of a technique
I've been studying for picking up women.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.800
You employ a visual display

01:31.700 --> 01:34.800
designed to make yourself
distinctive and memorable.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.700
Oh, yes, like the male peacock
with brilliant plumage

01:38.800 --> 01:41.500
or the rutting baboon
with engorged hindquarters.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.600
Or in this case,
the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.700
Mock me if you will,
but it works.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.900
You show up at a club
in something distinctive,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.100
scope out your target
and toss out some negs.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.600
- What are negs?
- A neg is a negative compliment

01:55.800 --> 01:57.600
that throws a pretty woman
off her game,

01:57.800 --> 02:01.000
like "Normally,
I'm not turned on by big teeth,

02:01.100 --> 02:02.700
but on you, they work."

02:04.300 --> 02:07.100
I got a whole list of 'em.
Who wants to be my wingman?

02:07.500 --> 02:10.800
You're not gonna need a wingman.
You're gonna need a paramedic.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.800
Your scooter's blocking my car.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.400
Did you get pinkeye again?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Step one:
she notices the eye patch.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.600
May I say, Penny,

02:23.700 --> 02:25.900
not a lot of women
could look as hot as you do

02:26.000 --> 02:27.500
with such greasy hair?

02:35.700 --> 02:37.200
Just move your stupid scooter

02:37.300 --> 02:39.900
before I pick it up
and throw it in the dumpster.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:11.600 --> 03:14.900
I'm sorry, but I'm not going
to watch <i>The Clone Wars</i> TV series

03:15.000 --> 03:17.200
until I've seen
<i>The Clone Wars</i> movie.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.500
I prefer to let George Lucas
disappoint me in the order he intended.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.900
I want to watch it now.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.000
Then I believe we've arrived
at another quintessential

03:29.100 --> 03:31.400
rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock moment.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.800
Watch whatever you want.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.600
I saw what you did there.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.800
What'd I do?

03:51.700 --> 03:52.800
What's wrong?

03:54.800 --> 03:57.100
- Okay, we'll be right there.
- What happened?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.600
Howard's at the Mars Rover lab.
He says he's in trouble.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.800
Defcon 5.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.100
Defcon 5?

04:02.400 --> 04:04.300
Well, there's no need to rush.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.800
- What?
- Defcon 5 means "no danger."

04:08.000 --> 04:09.400
Defcon 1 is a crisis.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.900
How can 5
not be worse than 1?

04:12.500 --> 04:13.900
<i>Star Trek V</i> worse than <i>I</i>.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.200
First of all, that's a comparison
of quality, not intensity.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.100
Secondly, <i>Star Trek I</i>
is orders-of-magnitude worse

04:22.200 --> 04:23.600
than <i>Star Trek V</i>.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.300
Are you joking?
<i>Star Trek V</i> is the standard

04:26.400 --> 04:28.400
against which all badness
is measured.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.400
No, no.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.200
<i>Star Trek V</i> has specific failures
in writing and direction,

04:33.400 --> 04:35.200
while <i>Star Trek I</i>
fails across the board:

04:35.400 --> 04:38.000
art direction, costuming,
music, sound editing.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.300
Can we just forget I said Defcon
and go?

04:43.100 --> 04:44.200
<i>Star Trek V</i>.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.700
Will you at least stipulate

04:48.800 --> 04:51.900
that <i>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</i>
is inarguably the best?

04:52.400 --> 04:55.200
I have three words for you:
Wrath of Khan.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
- Thank God, you're here.
- What's the emergency?

04:58.800 --> 05:01.000
I got the Mars Rover
stuck in a ditch.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Where?

05:03.100 --> 05:05.500
On a dusty highway
just outside Bakersfield.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.400
Where do you think?
On Mars!

05:08.500 --> 05:09.700
Is everything okay?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.900
Yeah, baby, I'll be right in.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.300
You brought a girl
to the Mars Rover control room?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.100
Yeah, I picked her up in the bar.
She's a doctor.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.600
One free barium enema,

05:20.700 --> 05:22.900
and my mother won't care
she's not Jewish.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.000
Wait a minute.
So the eye patch and the insults worked?

05:27.200 --> 05:30.700
No, there were three other guys
with eye patches. It was a fiasco.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.200
What did work was, "How'd you like
to visit a secret government facility?"

05:36.400 --> 05:38.400
So what exactly
do you want us to do?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.500
You and Raj help me
get the Rover out of the ditch

05:40.700 --> 05:42.900
and you get Stephanie out
before somebody notices her.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.000
- She doesn't exactly have clearance.
- Really?

05:45.100 --> 05:47.100
They don't let strange
women from honky-tonks

05:47.200 --> 05:50.700
come in and play with $200 million
government projects on distant planets?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.500
Yes, I was bad.
Maybe she'll spank me.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.900
Can we please move on?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.300
It's getting late,
so do I get to drive this thing or what?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.300
No. I'm sorry,
but something's come up.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.000
Kind of a Mars Rover...

06:05.600 --> 06:08.300
Mars Rover
can Howard come over...

06:11.400 --> 06:12.400
situation.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.100
So my friend Leonard
is gonna take you home.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.700
Okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.000
- I'll call ya.
- So are you a scientist like Howard?

06:24.300 --> 06:26.400
No one's a scientist like Howard.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.100
My mother is so gonna love her.

06:30.500 --> 06:34.300
How nice. Maybe they can carpool
when they visit you in federal prison.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.600
I'm sorry.
I totally interrupted you.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.000
What were you saying?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
Just said Howard's a terrific guy.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.100
He's got a great sense of humor.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.500
He loves his mother...

06:53.700 --> 06:54.700
a lot.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.400
People say "too much."

06:57.500 --> 06:59.400
I really like
that you're such a loyal friend.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.200
Yeah, I am loyal.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.900
If you look at the big picture.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Out of curiosity,
did he ever have a shot with you?

07:12.300 --> 07:15.100
Are you insane?
The guy was wearing an eye patch.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.300
Then why did you...?

07:17.500 --> 07:20.000
He said that I could drive a car...
on Mars.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
Got it.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.300
So, can I see you again?

07:27.100 --> 07:28.900
You're not gonna see me now.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.100
Cool.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.400
Anything?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.700
Actually, I was just
checking my e-mail.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.300
But, no,
the Rover is not responding.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.300
I believe the appropriate metaphor here
involves a river of excrement

07:51.400 --> 07:54.900
and a Native American water vessel
without any means of propulsion.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.000
Hang on.
There's got to be other options.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.900
You could try calling Triple-A.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.300
But based on NASA's latest timetable,
they won't get there for 35 years.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.400
Plus I understand
you have to be standing

08:07.500 --> 08:10.100
next to the vehicle
with your card when they arrive.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
Oh, snap.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Snap what?

08:15.600 --> 08:18.000
- I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
- What's Plan B?

08:18.100 --> 08:19.900
Erase hard drives,
scrap surveillance tapes,

08:20.100 --> 08:22.700
wipe our fingerprints
off every surface and run.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.600
Why wasn't that Plan A?

08:27.600 --> 08:30.500
<i>A NASA spokesman states
that due to the loss of data,</i>

08:30.600 --> 08:33.500
<i>they will most likely be unable
to determine the cause</i>

08:33.600 --> 08:35.500
<i>of the Mars Rover's malfunction.</i>

08:38.700 --> 08:40.400
Thank God for Plan B.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.900
Didn't you say
you worked on the Mars Rover?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.400
No, you're mistaken.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.900
When we first met,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.800
you said that if I went out with you,
I could drive a car on Mars.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.800
I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.900
Will you all excuse me?
Leonard is subtly signaling

09:03.000 --> 09:05.400
that he'd like
to talk to me in private.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.300
No. I remember specifically.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.400
You started by asking
if I was from Mars

09:11.600 --> 09:13.800
because my ass
was out of this world.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
That does sound like me,
but no.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.000
Is there some problem?

09:22.900 --> 09:25.700
Listen, I have to kinda
sneak out for a while.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
- All right, good-bye.
- No, wait!

09:29.500 --> 09:32.000
If anyone asks you where I went,
you don't know.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.000
- Where are you going?
- I can't tell you that.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.300
Who would ask me?

09:38.700 --> 09:40.500
I can't tell you that, either.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.600
You brought me in here to inform me
you can't tell me where you're going

09:44.900 --> 09:47.100
and you can't tell me
who might ask?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.600
Yeah, I really didn't
think this through.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.600
- Leonard, a moment.
- What?

09:55.900 --> 09:58.300
If someone, and of course,
we don't know who this would be,

09:58.400 --> 10:00.800
does ask where you've gone,
what should I say?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.200
I don't know.
Just tell 'em I went to the office.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.100
- Are you going to the office?
- No.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.100
Then how can I say it convincingly?

10:07.600 --> 10:09.500
Just say,
"Leonard went to the office."

10:09.800 --> 10:12.900
All right.
Leonard went to the office.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.600
What is...? No, not like that!

10:20.800 --> 10:23.500
- Just, "Leonard went to the office."
- It would've worked out a lot better

10:23.600 --> 10:25.800
if you'd just told me
you were going to the office.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.900
I'm going to the office.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.900
See? Why don't I believe you?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.000
I'm going out for a while.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.600
Doesn't anyone want to know
where he's going?

10:52.600 --> 10:53.900
Okay, where is he going?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.300
Leonard is going to the office.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.900
- So how was work today?
- Busy.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.000
I removed an appendix,
a gall bladder

11:15.200 --> 11:17.300
and about a foot
and a half of bowel.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.100
I'm hoping that was
three different guys.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.000
No, just the one.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.000
He didn't make it.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.300
So, how was your day?

11:31.400 --> 11:34.400
You know, I'm a physicist, so...
I thought about stuff.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.400
That's it?

11:38.200 --> 11:40.000
I wrote some of it down.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.300
- Are you done eating?
- Yeah.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.700
Good.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.400
If I knew you were waiting,
I would've swallowed that lasagna whole.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.600
<i>You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.
Leave a message.</i>

11:59.400 --> 12:00.700
<i>It's me again, Howard.</i>

12:00.800 --> 12:02.000
<i>If you're free Friday,</i>

12:02.100 --> 12:04.600
<i>maybe we could have
a little something to eat at my place.</i>

12:04.700 --> 12:06.600
<i>My mom cooks a hell of a brisket.</i>

12:08.500 --> 12:09.600
<i>Let me know.</i>

12:10.000 --> 12:11.100
<i>It's Howard.</i>

12:13.400 --> 12:15.600
I've had her brisket.
Melts in your mouth.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.300
Maybe we should think
about going to the bedroom.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.700
Good idea.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.900
There's a bed in there,
and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.

12:31.100 --> 12:34.000
<i>You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.
Leave a message.</i>

12:35.200 --> 12:36.700
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

12:37.800 --> 12:39.200
<i>Just want to let you know</i>

12:39.300 --> 12:42.100
<i>the head count for dinner Friday
has gone up.</i>

12:42.600 --> 12:46.300
<i>My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot
are coming in from Palm Springs.</i>

12:47.000 --> 12:48.300
<i>If anybody should ask,</i>

12:48.400 --> 12:50.700
<i>you're half-Jewish
on your mother's side.</i>

12:51.900 --> 12:53.000
<i>Okay, call me.</i>

12:53.700 --> 12:54.900
<i>It's Howard.</i>

12:57.000 --> 12:59.400
Don't you think we should tell him
you're not interested?

13:00.400 --> 13:03.300
Do you want me to stop
and call him back right now?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.600
Dear God, no!

13:13.200 --> 13:15.800
<i>You've reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett.
Leave a message.</i>

13:16.900 --> 13:18.400
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

13:21.200 --> 13:24.700
<i>My cousins from Fort Lauderdale
are flying in to meet you</i>

13:24.800 --> 13:26.900
<i>so that means we're gonna
have to move the dinner</i>

13:27.000 --> 13:28.400
<i>to a restaurant.</i>

13:28.900 --> 13:31.700
<i>Tell her we're going
to the Olive Garden!</i>

13:33.200 --> 13:35.700
<i>I have a coupon from the paper.</i>

13:36.800 --> 13:40.000
<i>We're not going
to the Olive Garden, Ma!</i>

13:41.400 --> 13:44.400
<i>Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.</i>

13:46.500 --> 13:48.800
<i>I'll call you back
when we firm up the details.</i>

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
<i>It's Howard.</i>

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
- New shirts?
- Yeah, a couple.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.300
- Nice.
- Thank you.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.000
So, who's the girl?

14:06.200 --> 14:07.000
I'm sorry?

14:07.200 --> 14:10.000
Well, last time you bought a new shirt
was when we were dating.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.400
So what we did
was in fact dating?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.800
Well, yeah, we did have a date.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.300
Exactly. Thank you.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.700
Do me a favor, tell Koothrappali that
next time you see him.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.800
So, who is she?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.300
- She's a doctor.
- Nice.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.000
A doctor doctor,
or a you kind of doctor?

14:33.200 --> 14:34.200
Doctor doctor.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.600
Surgical resident.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.200
Smart, pretty.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.500
Let me ask you something.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.100
If your friend thinks
he's dating someone,

14:45.300 --> 14:47.800
but he's not because, in fact,
you're dating her,

14:47.900 --> 14:49.700
does that make you a bad person?

14:50.100 --> 14:51.900
- That depends.
- On what?

14:52.300 --> 14:53.900
Is that friend Wolowitz?

14:56.800 --> 14:58.100
Screw him. You're fine.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.100
Are you sure?

15:02.400 --> 15:04.400
Well, have you slept
with her yet?

15:06.300 --> 15:07.600
You dog!

15:09.700 --> 15:10.900
Good for you.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.500
- Does that change things?
- No.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.900
- So why'd you ask?
- I'm nosy.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
See ya.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.400
Howard, get the door!

15:28.200 --> 15:30.800
Really? Is that what you do
when someone knocks?!

15:30.900 --> 15:32.800
Thank you. I had no idea!

15:35.900 --> 15:39.100
Hey, buddy. What brings you
to my little slice of hell?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.400
Who is it?!

15:42.000 --> 15:43.200
It's Leonard!

15:43.400 --> 15:45.900
You're gonna have to play outside!

15:46.000 --> 15:48.400
I'm not dressed to receive!

15:49.800 --> 15:51.500
No one cares, Ma!

15:52.000 --> 15:53.100
So, what's up?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.900
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.900
Momentito.

16:01.900 --> 16:02.900
Yello.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.600
Thanks for calling me back.
I was worried...

16:19.100 --> 16:20.800
No, I understand.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.800
Sure, we can be friends.
Absolutely.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.300
Thanks for calling.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.600
You have a nice day, too.

16:28.800 --> 16:29.900
You are dead to me.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.100
Who gets the extra dumpling?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.400
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.600
Okay, one of us is going to have
to stop putting up Spock.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.300
How do we decide that?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.100
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.500
Hi, Howard.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.000
Howard is employing
a schoolyard paradigm

17:12.099 --> 17:15.099
in which you are,
for all intents and purposes, deceased.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.300
He intends to act on this
by not speaking to you,

17:19.400 --> 17:21.700
feigning an inability to hear you
when you speak

17:21.800 --> 17:24.599
and otherwise refusing
to acknowledge your existence.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.900
That's just ridiculous.
Why are you cooperating with him?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.400
I don't make the rules, Leonard.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.500
Howard, come on.
I didn't plan on this.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.100
These things just happen.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.600
Usually not to me,
but they do happen.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.500
Did someone just feel
a cold breeze?

17:43.800 --> 17:46.100
I believe this is an extension
of the death metaphor.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.600
The cold breeze is the so-called
ectoplasmic issue

17:49.700 --> 17:51.600
of a disembodied soul passing by.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.400
Screw it.
I'm just gonna eat the dumpling.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.700
- Come on in.
- Is this a bad time?

18:03.900 --> 18:06.000
Yes, but I don't see
a better one on the horizon.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
If it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.100
I'm sorry, you violated
the terms of your metaphor

18:16.200 --> 18:18.300
by acknowledging her existence.
I'm out.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.000
He just won't listen to me.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.900
Okay, I guess it'll just be
the three of us then.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.400
Lisa's gonna be disappointed.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.100
Lisa?

18:30.100 --> 18:32.600
My roommate. She just went through
a really bad breakup,

18:32.800 --> 18:35.500
I thought she might like
to meet somebody fun like you.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.800
Leonard, Stephanie,
you're alive!

18:39.000 --> 18:40.200
It's a miracle!

18:43.700 --> 18:46.100
So, anyway, Lisa,
I just wanted to tell you again

18:46.200 --> 18:48.100
how much I enjoyed the other night,

18:48.200 --> 18:50.400
and again,
I'm sorry for how it ended.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.100
But again, if you could
let me know about Friday.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.600
My mother needs a head count

18:56.700 --> 18:58.900
so she can know
how big a brisket to get.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.500
Howard, look at this.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.700
Anyway, call me.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.100
It's Howard.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.000
<i>It's unclear how the Mars Rover
got into the crevice,</i>

19:09.400 --> 19:10.900
<i>but one thing's certain:</i>

19:11.000 --> 19:12.600
<i>the data which it has sent back</i>

19:12.900 --> 19:14.900
<i>contain the first clear indications</i>

19:15.000 --> 19:17.200
<i>that there may have been
life on Mars.</i>

19:19.300 --> 19:20.900
<i>It's a scientific discovery</i>

19:21.000 --> 19:23.700
<i>that has staggering implications
for all mankind.</i>

19:24.200 --> 19:27.300
<i>Unfortunately, we'll never know
who's responsible.</i>

19:32.900 --> 19:34.400
Son of a bitch.
