00:01.097 --> 00:02.928
'In the criminal justice system,

00:02.977 --> 00:06.447
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.497 --> 00:10.331
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.377 --> 00:13.892
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.'

00:13.937 --> 00:16.326
'These are their stories.'

00:18.457 --> 00:20.812
- What are they?
- Bird-watchers.

00:20.857 --> 00:24.327
There's a lot of them in this part of the park.

00:24.377 --> 00:28.052
- Boring.
- You get to sit down.

00:28.097 --> 00:30.895
Grandpa, that's no fun. This is.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.373
I'll get it, Grandpa.

00:35.417 --> 00:39.092
No. I don't want you
going off the path by yourself.

00:43.057 --> 00:45.366
Did you find it?

00:47.737 --> 00:50.126
I'll buy you a new one.

00:50.177 --> 00:51.974
Carlyle, Homicide.

00:52.017 --> 00:55.487
Stabler, Special Victims.
My partner, Benson. Who's the brass?

00:55.537 --> 00:59.530
Honcho, One Police Plaza.
Wants the perp arrested yesterday.

00:59.577 --> 01:03.206
- He should talk to HG Wells.
- Why the pressure?

01:03.257 --> 01:06.533
The vic was an ADA, Karen Fitzgerald.

01:06.577 --> 01:11.810
Found dead in the bushes late this
afternoon. Raped. Shot in the head.

01:11.857 --> 01:14.655
I know her. I knew her. She's my age.

01:14.697 --> 01:17.848
We had drinks together
a few times after court.

01:17.897 --> 01:22.095
It's all yours.
CSU can tell you what they got so far.

02:10.577 --> 02:15.526
Mayor's aide wants the suspect in
the Fitzgerald rape-homicide ASAP.

02:15.577 --> 02:19.695
- Where are we with this?
- She'd been an ADA for two years.

02:19.737 --> 02:25.209
She took on every case. Didn't care
if it lowered her win/lose average.

02:25.257 --> 02:27.293
- You knew her?
- Acquaintances.

02:27.337 --> 02:32.013
I wish we'd been friends.
She tried to put the bad guys in jail.

02:32.057 --> 02:37.575
A lot walked. We have a dump truck
full of perps. People with a grudge.

02:37.617 --> 02:41.246
Anything at the crime scene
to indicate that she knew the killer?

02:41.297 --> 02:43.731
Anger. The guy beat her with a rock,

02:43.777 --> 02:47.611
raped her and then took time out
of his schedule to shoot her twice.

02:47.657 --> 02:51.616
Remember the Labor Day rapist?
Raped someone on Labor Day.

02:51.657 --> 02:55.286
- Probably 10 rapes on Labor Day.
- Papers picked up on this one,

02:55.337 --> 02:59.330
put their heads together and came up
with that moniker for the doer.

02:59.377 --> 03:04.371
In the Ramble, just like this one.
No homicide but a beating. Still open.

03:04.417 --> 03:08.296
- You're saying the same perp?
- Man's starting to think like me.

03:08.337 --> 03:09.372
Only slower.

03:09.417 --> 03:13.126
Jeffries, Briscoe, break out
the Labor Day file. See what was missed.

03:13.177 --> 03:17.534
I'll re-walk the scene with Benson,
get a feel for what went down.

03:17.577 --> 03:21.855
You got it. Munch, draw parallels
between Labor Day and yesterday.

03:21.897 --> 03:25.128
See if we got a rape between the two
with the same MO.

03:28.137 --> 03:32.574
We're assuming she was grabbed
and hustled into the bushes over here.

03:32.617 --> 03:35.654
- What are the round casts?
- Knees.

03:35.697 --> 03:37.927
Perp made her crawl?

03:37.977 --> 03:41.367
No handprints here.
What do you make of that?

03:41.417 --> 03:45.456
- She was begging.
- Not to be raped or for her life?

03:45.497 --> 03:47.533
Both.

03:47.577 --> 03:51.206
The perp picked up a rock.
We've got that at the lab.

03:51.257 --> 03:56.012
Broken nose. Blood on her clothes.
Also found the condom wrapper.

03:56.057 --> 03:59.652
She's crawling away with a broken nose,
raped, begging for her life?

03:59.697 --> 04:02.052
Then he shoots her twice.

04:02.097 --> 04:06.568
Spent rounds from.44. One went into
her left eye, lodged in the ground.

04:06.617 --> 04:10.405
The other one took off part of
her head and then ricocheted up there.

04:14.177 --> 04:17.327
- Did you find a book?
- No, why?

04:17.377 --> 04:22.087
Her secretary said she came to
the Ramble to read cos it's so serene.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.367
No book.

04:24.417 --> 04:27.375
What if she was dragged from this side?

04:31.497 --> 04:33.294
I need gloves.

04:35.457 --> 04:38.255
- 'A Burnt Out Case.'
- Murder mystery.

04:38.297 --> 04:41.050
- I guess we screwed up.
- No, you didn't.

04:41.097 --> 04:45.170
Let's just say that she was dragged
from this side, it means she was...

04:45.217 --> 04:48.334
Grabbed from this side.
Probably off that bench.

04:49.337 --> 04:52.886
Hey, hey,
I'm losing the warbling vireo, lady.

04:52.937 --> 04:55.770
We'd like to ask you some questions.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.650
- He almost pushes me off the bench.
- What time?

04:58.697 --> 05:03.248
- 3:30. I'd just spotted an...
- Did he say anything?

05:03.297 --> 05:05.492
- No.
- Did you?

05:05.537 --> 05:09.689
I'm not comfortable talking to people,
that's why I watch birds.

05:09.737 --> 05:12.046
What's this?

05:12.097 --> 05:16.648
There are 20,000 known sex offenders
on our computer. I narrowed it down.

05:16.697 --> 05:20.292
- Holler if you see him.
- Be better if they had feathers.

05:20.337 --> 05:22.134
You can use your binoculars.

05:27.697 --> 05:30.006
That's him! Upper left-hand corner.

05:30.057 --> 05:32.810
Off the first six. Are you sure?

05:32.857 --> 05:35.417
Pretty sure.

05:35.457 --> 05:37.925
Nah. Yeah.

05:37.977 --> 05:42.095
OK. I'm gonna print him out. Why
don't we take a look at a few more?

05:43.097 --> 05:45.292
No. None of these guys.

05:46.297 --> 05:49.448
Wait, wait, wait. Nah.

05:50.857 --> 05:53.849
- Any of these?
- That's him. Right-hand corner.

05:53.897 --> 05:57.890
- The first guy isn't the guy?
- They both look like the guy.

05:57.937 --> 06:01.452
If I'm not doing this right,
you can get someone else.

06:01.497 --> 06:05.490
- You're our witness, we need you.
- Can I have a Coke or a Pepsi?

06:05.537 --> 06:08.005
Sprite. Get me a Pepsi.

06:08.057 --> 06:11.254
10 IDs. Birdman ID'd 10 people.

06:11.297 --> 06:14.369
- Larry Bird and the Partridge Family.
- What's this?

06:14.417 --> 06:19.366
Prosecutor's office cross-referenced
the IDs with Fitzgerald's cases.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.977
They made two hits. Kenneth Maggio.

06:22.017 --> 06:26.966
Convicted of forcible sodomy.
Did time in Elmira. He's out on parole.

06:27.017 --> 06:29.372
We're gonna bang at Mr Richard White.

06:29.417 --> 06:34.855
- Where's he on the bell curve?
- Date rape. He's a realtor.

06:34.897 --> 06:37.775
- I was shocked to read about it.
- Why?

06:37.817 --> 06:40.968
Nobody deserves to die that way.
I felt for the woman.

06:41.017 --> 06:44.771
Felt what? Happy the woman who
prosecuted you on a date-rape charge

06:44.817 --> 06:47.536
wouldn't prosecute you in the future?

06:47.577 --> 06:52.253
It was reduced to sexual assault.
My lawyer advised me to plead guilty.

06:52.297 --> 06:56.336
A lot of grey area in a 'he said,
she said' he said. I was innocent.

06:56.377 --> 07:01.053
- So, you were railroaded?
- Her death made you feel angst?

07:01.097 --> 07:04.294
I, er, tend to take an objective view of things.

07:04.337 --> 07:07.056
Fitzgerald was doing her job.
She was wrong.

07:07.097 --> 07:11.613
No hard feelings. She was doing
what she was hired to do. I forgive her.

07:11.657 --> 07:14.455
- Do you forgive Louise Billings?
- Hm?

07:14.497 --> 07:18.934
- She accused you of the date rape.
- Louise was confused.

07:18.977 --> 07:22.413
- She didn't know how the world worked.
- Enlighten us.

07:22.457 --> 07:26.496
She had invited me to dinner,
a month after we broke it off.

07:26.537 --> 07:30.610
One thing led to another
and, er, we had sex.

07:30.657 --> 07:34.536
Louise thought it meant more.
She got angry and filed charges.

07:34.577 --> 07:37.171
Everyone involved was wrong but you.

07:38.177 --> 07:40.213
It happens.

07:40.257 --> 07:43.932
Where were you yesterday
between 3:00 and 5:00pm?

07:43.977 --> 07:48.289
- Astoria. I was previewing a house.
- Can you confirm that?

07:48.337 --> 07:51.090
Yes, I was the only realtor at the property.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.492
I had to use the lock box to get in.

07:53.537 --> 07:57.212
That information is faxed
to the listing agent, who would be...

08:00.097 --> 08:03.567
- Krim Properties, Jamaica.
- Can anyone corroborate your alibi?

08:03.617 --> 08:07.849
My business partner, Kimberley Phillips.
She knows where I was.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.615
- Mr Levin, you spoke to a patrolman?
- Yes.

08:12.657 --> 08:16.616
I told him I'd help after I finished my studies.

08:16.657 --> 08:19.410
This is about Labor Day.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.132
The man I saw in the park.
Do you want me to look at pictures?

08:23.177 --> 08:25.327
That's why we're here.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.333
No.

08:27.377 --> 08:29.333
No.

08:29.377 --> 08:31.288
No.

08:31.337 --> 08:35.216
It's been two hours.
Must I keep looking at these?

08:35.256 --> 08:38.932
- Would be a mitzvah.
- Are you?

08:38.977 --> 08:42.447
Why don't you do 12 more for the 12 tribes?

08:42.496 --> 08:44.852
You are, aren't you?

08:44.897 --> 08:47.331
OK, 12 more.

08:49.377 --> 08:51.732
Him.

08:51.777 --> 08:56.055
The putz who ran into me and
called me a Jew bastard on Labor Day.

08:56.097 --> 08:59.009
- Sure?
- These things you don't forget.

08:59.057 --> 09:03.767
Jean Dussault, Canadian. Deported.
Cassidy, put a call into Canada.

09:03.817 --> 09:08.049
- See if this guy's registered.
- Know the area code for Montreal?

09:09.297 --> 09:13.085
- I have to walk back to Riverdale.
- I'll put you in a squad car.

09:13.137 --> 09:18.370
Shabbat starts soon. I can't be in a car.
God protects when you observe.

09:18.417 --> 09:22.012
The Jews have kept the Sabbath
and the Sabbath has kept the Jews.

09:22.057 --> 09:27.131
We'll drive you home.
You won't make it through the South Bronx.

09:27.177 --> 09:30.214
- Versteh?
- Versteh.

09:32.897 --> 09:35.855
Whoever invented lock boxes, I love them.

09:35.897 --> 09:40.971
We hang one on a house, any licensed
agent can get inside without us.

09:41.017 --> 09:45.727
Do you have a fax for yesterday
from Newton and 28th Street?

09:45.777 --> 09:49.372
I should have.

09:49.417 --> 09:53.126
Do you do much business
with a Richard White?

09:53.177 --> 09:56.806
Quite a bit. We specialise
in low-income housing.

09:56.857 --> 10:00.975
White, Phillips attract low-income buyers,
but they're in Manhattan.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.726
Clients get an Uptown feel before
they buy a fixer-upper.

10:04.777 --> 10:06.813
- OK, thanks.
- Money pits.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.246
White's alibi checked for Labor Day.

10:09.297 --> 10:12.926
Mr White was at the property,
4:00pm yesterday. Is he in trouble?

10:12.977 --> 10:15.366
Is selling money pits a crime?

10:15.417 --> 10:19.376
- I got him, the Labor Day rapist.
- Are you the Lone Ranger now?

10:19.417 --> 10:24.172
Forensics never matched
the pubic hairs found in the vic to anyone.

10:24.217 --> 10:28.972
I gave 'em Desault. His DNA and hair
showed up on a prior record. Bingo.

10:29.017 --> 10:31.326
- Where is he?
- Canada's looking.

10:31.377 --> 10:35.928
Great. While Dudley Do-Right's
out searching the 10 provinces,

10:35.977 --> 10:39.014
Desault be back in this country.
He's still a suspect.

10:39.057 --> 10:44.256
- Go ahead, rain on my parade.
- I wanna blow up all the floats.

10:44.297 --> 10:47.733
- Where we going?
- East Side. I spoke to Maggio's PO.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.211
The sodomite works
in a doughnut shop there.

10:52.697 --> 10:55.257
Does Kenneth Maggio work for you?

10:55.297 --> 10:58.653
Oh, the crook. He's baking in the back.

10:58.697 --> 11:01.006
- These safe to eat?
- Best in town.

11:01.057 --> 11:02.888
Not sure that's a yes.

11:02.937 --> 11:06.646
Police. We're looking for Kenneth Maggio.
He committed sodomy.

11:06.697 --> 11:09.530
- You'll ruin my rep.
- You beat us to it.

11:09.577 --> 11:14.935
You won't get the pastry chef job
at Bouley Bakery. Look, what a cliché.

11:14.977 --> 11:20.131
Shaves his head to look different
but he makes himself look more ugly.

11:20.177 --> 11:23.487
- What's next? Fake glasses?
- Does this turn you on?

11:23.537 --> 11:24.936
What do you want?

11:24.977 --> 11:28.572
It's dangerous for you to be around
these helpless doughnuts.

11:28.617 --> 11:32.087
- What do you want?
- Your alibi yesterday, 3:00-5:00 pm.

11:32.137 --> 11:36.050
- Home. I was home.
- You're not lying to us, are you?

11:36.097 --> 11:40.010
You'd better talk to us cos
we're looking to you for rape-homicide.

11:40.057 --> 11:43.208
Fitzgerald? The bitch who prosecuted me.

11:43.257 --> 11:47.489
Hey, you can't pin that on me.
I was with my lover.

11:47.537 --> 11:50.256
Frank Stern. Lives on Jane Street.

11:50.297 --> 11:55.451
You went over to the dark side?
How convenient. Too gay to rape a DA.

11:55.497 --> 12:00.617
You wanna know why?
I'll show you why, huh? Here. See?

12:00.657 --> 12:05.447
See? They gave me a welcome bath
at Elmira. Soap and sulphuric acid.

12:05.497 --> 12:08.057
I can't even rape a freaking ant.

12:10.057 --> 12:14.573
Teddy Kennedy lands in the water
at Chappaquiddick, July 18th,

12:14.617 --> 12:17.495
Neil Armstrong lands on the moon,
July 20th.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.097
- And?
- You don't find that amazing?

12:20.137 --> 12:22.253
- No.
- You're learning.

12:22.297 --> 12:24.686
What's with the doughnut guy?

12:24.737 --> 12:28.446
He'll never be accused of a crime
involving penile penetration.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.489
- Why?
- Acid on the scrotum.

12:31.537 --> 12:34.290
Does anybody look good for Labor Day?

12:34.337 --> 12:38.250
Cassidy nailed a guy, Jean Dussault,
who was deported to Canada.

12:38.297 --> 12:42.176
Canada can't find him.
They got the dog sleds looking for him now.

12:42.217 --> 12:47.166
Keep on him. Desault's Labor Day MO
is similar to the Fitzgerald rape.

12:47.217 --> 12:50.448
- Now, your guy, what's his name?
- Richard White.

12:50.497 --> 12:54.695
- Yeah. Where does he sit now?
- Alibi looks good for Fitzgerald.

12:54.737 --> 12:59.606
I went over his trial transcript.
She lets him plead down midway through,

12:59.657 --> 13:03.013
after dragging him through the mud.
He must've hated her.

13:03.057 --> 13:07.687
All right.
Talk to the date-rape victim, Louise Billings.

13:07.737 --> 13:11.127
Jeffries got a hold of Fitzgerald's
best friend, an attorney.

13:11.177 --> 13:13.372
Joan Simon. She's coming in.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.853
You should get some background
there, too. Let's get him.

13:21.257 --> 13:25.967
Richard could be a really sweet man.
But sometimes he'd get abusive.

13:26.017 --> 13:28.611
He'd push me around.

13:29.617 --> 13:33.815
Make me do things... sexually
that I really didn't wanna do.

13:33.857 --> 13:36.610
Like Mr Jekyll and Dr Hyde?

13:36.657 --> 13:41.856
I lost weight. I couldn't sleep.
Broke it off after three years.

13:41.897 --> 13:45.207
- How did he react?
- He was calm, said he understood.

13:45.257 --> 13:48.772
- How did he react to that?
- I kept bumping into him.

13:48.817 --> 13:52.014
We'd make small talk, then he'd move on.

13:52.057 --> 13:55.208
It was like talking to an old friend not a lover.

13:55.257 --> 14:00.206
- How often did you run into him?
- I don't know. Three times a month.

14:00.257 --> 14:06.651
Do you think it was odd? In a city this size
you accidentally crossed paths, how often?

14:06.697 --> 14:11.293
My shrink says it was a classic case
of cognitive dissonance.

14:12.297 --> 14:14.652
So...

14:14.697 --> 14:17.291
We ran into each other again.

14:20.897 --> 14:23.331
Richard was in a charming mood.

14:23.377 --> 14:26.892
I invited him up for dinner,
for old time's sake.

14:26.937 --> 14:31.567
He got drunk
and then I was looking at Mr Hyde.

14:31.617 --> 14:34.336
He grabbed me and threw me down.

14:34.377 --> 14:39.770
And he told me to crawl to him
and beg for forgiveness. And I did.

14:45.697 --> 14:50.691
Probably saved your life.
It wasn't weak to face him in court.

14:54.657 --> 14:58.252
Karen Fitzgerald
gave me the strength to do that.

15:01.177 --> 15:03.930
And after it was all over,

15:03.977 --> 15:06.775
do you know what Richard did?

15:07.977 --> 15:13.574
He sent me flowers with a note that said,'
No hard feelings.'

15:14.577 --> 15:17.330
How long did you know Karen?

15:17.377 --> 15:20.369
Since law school. We were very close.

15:21.377 --> 15:25.495
They don't teach you self-defence
in the New York law books.

15:25.537 --> 15:28.256
Did she ever say she was afraid of anyone?

15:28.297 --> 15:33.974
Never. She was fearless.
Not trusting. Not naive. Fearless.

15:34.017 --> 15:39.694
Guys would hit on us, she'd flash
her ADA ID and they'd disappear.

15:39.737 --> 15:41.534
Can you think of any incident,

15:41.577 --> 15:44.728
regardless of whether or not
you think it's relevant?

15:45.737 --> 15:49.491
We were having lunch,
there was a guy sitting across from us.

15:49.537 --> 15:51.892
He was smiling, staring.

15:51.937 --> 15:57.375
I pointed him out and Karen got rattled.
She said that we should leave.

15:57.417 --> 15:59.726
- Did she say why?
- No.

15:59.777 --> 16:03.895
I asked her about it a few weeks later
and she still said nothing.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.885
Do you see him on this page?

16:12.217 --> 16:14.492
That's him.

16:18.297 --> 16:23.166
White sends flowers to one vic,
smiles at another. Your point?

16:23.217 --> 16:25.412
He's stalking her.

16:25.457 --> 16:29.450
We don't have a stalking statute,
ergo there's no way to stalk anyone.

16:29.497 --> 16:33.172
An assistant DA's murder,
maybe they'll change the statute.

16:33.217 --> 16:38.007
I got White's trial transcript.
Phillips was a character witness.

16:38.057 --> 16:41.572
She's corroborating his alibi
for the Fitzgerald rape.

16:41.617 --> 16:45.929
She might be the weak link.
Why stay partners with garbage like White?

16:45.977 --> 16:49.970
- Maybe she's afraid.
- Maybe. See if she says that.

16:52.017 --> 16:54.212
Miss Phillips?

16:54.257 --> 16:57.693
Is this the house
Mr White was at on Thursday?

16:57.737 --> 17:01.173
- It's all in the broker's report.
- Sorry. Say that again.

17:01.217 --> 17:05.005
It's all in the broker's report.
Here, I'll show you.

17:06.617 --> 17:10.576
When I get the key,
it makes a record of my visit.

17:10.617 --> 17:14.212
All of your information
is being sent to Krim Properties?

17:14.257 --> 17:17.488
- That's how it works.
- Do you know Richard White well?

17:17.537 --> 17:20.893
Well enough.
He's my business partner after all.

17:20.936 --> 17:23.326
- For how long?
- Two years.

17:23.377 --> 17:26.449
I met Richard when were at an open house.

17:26.497 --> 17:30.285
He proposed that we start our own company
and he'd provide the money.

17:30.337 --> 17:32.532
Just like that?

17:32.577 --> 17:36.616
We'd talked about big realty companies
eating up our commissions.

17:36.657 --> 17:39.808
You went into business
with a complete stranger?

17:39.857 --> 17:42.166
Actually, I said no.

17:42.217 --> 17:46.005
I thought he was a little odd.
Kind of blew him off initially.

17:46.057 --> 17:49.447
- What turned you around?
- He did a sweet thing.

17:49.497 --> 17:53.536
He sent me flowers, with a card
that said his feelings weren't hurt.

17:53.577 --> 17:55.852
He's persistent.

17:55.897 --> 17:58.650
That's what it takes in real estate.

17:58.697 --> 18:03.646
We ran into each other at these open
houses. He pitched the idea to me.

18:03.697 --> 18:07.895
After a while it started sounding good.
So, I said, 'Why not?'

18:07.937 --> 18:11.373
- And you've done well together?
- Yeah. Very.

18:11.417 --> 18:16.013
I have a closing in half an hour.
Does that answer your questions?

18:16.057 --> 18:18.491
Yeah.

18:18.537 --> 18:20.926
- If we need anything, we'll call.
- OK.

18:20.977 --> 18:23.491
- Great. Thank you.
- Yeah. Bye.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.173
- She's holding out.
- Are you getting that, too?

18:29.217 --> 18:31.526
Tell me why.

18:31.577 --> 18:35.047
White's a suspect
in a rape-homicide investigation?

18:35.097 --> 18:37.850
I'd be afraid to talk about him, too.

18:37.897 --> 18:42.846
If he's threatening her, she could
always come to us. Why cover for him?

18:42.897 --> 18:48.415
Why did Louise Billings let him into
her apartment? Somehow he controls.

18:49.457 --> 18:53.575
I know you've fixed on White.
Desault is still a question mark.

18:53.617 --> 18:56.575
Munch and Canada
are dealing with Desault.

18:56.617 --> 19:00.053
We'll keep White
until we have a reason not to.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.373
If White's it,
do you think Phillips knows what he did?

19:03.417 --> 19:05.373
No.

19:05.417 --> 19:09.171
But I think he's got something on her
to make her do what he asks.

19:09.217 --> 19:13.369
- You check her for priors?
- Yeah. Zero.

19:13.417 --> 19:18.127
I understand this guy, Don.
He hates women who take control.

19:18.177 --> 19:23.376
He always gets it back. Louise took
control by breaking it off with him.

19:23.417 --> 19:26.489
White raped her to control her.

19:26.537 --> 19:31.167
It's the same thing with Fitzgerald.
She took control by prosecuting him,

19:31.217 --> 19:33.014
disparaging his reputation.

19:33.057 --> 19:35.730
We know what he did to get control back.

19:35.777 --> 19:39.326
So, bring him in and talk to him.

19:40.577 --> 19:43.410
What if he won't come voluntarily?

19:43.457 --> 19:47.132
He'll enjoy taking you on,
but if he won't come nicely

19:47.177 --> 19:50.169
I'll get a warrant for parole violation.

19:50.217 --> 19:52.856
What was it like
before you became a detective?

19:52.897 --> 19:54.455
What was what like?

19:54.497 --> 19:57.455
Did you wear a uniform?
You're in one now, though...

19:57.497 --> 19:59.488
We're not here to talk about me.

19:59.537 --> 20:02.688
I get it. Enough about me.
What do you think about me?

20:02.737 --> 20:06.889
Right. Well, for openers,
your alibi for Fitzgerald is shredding.

20:06.937 --> 20:08.893
- Oh?
- Yeah, the lock box.

20:08.937 --> 20:12.293
Seems anybody could've used it
if they had your code.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.487
- You didn't have to be there.
- But I was.

20:14.537 --> 20:18.086
See, this is what's weird
cos your partner says you weren't.

20:18.137 --> 20:20.093
She didn't tell the truth.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.492
- How can you be sure?
- Because you're not.

20:22.537 --> 20:24.687
Oh.

20:24.737 --> 20:27.297
You dress down but you're very attractive.

20:27.337 --> 20:30.886
- Is this your famous charm, White?
- Richard, Olivia.

20:30.937 --> 20:33.292
- It's Detective Benson.
- I know.

20:33.337 --> 20:38.092
A year and a half in the Special Victims Unit.
A graduate of Siena College.

20:39.297 --> 20:42.687
Public record. You can find anything
if you know where to look.

20:42.737 --> 20:45.297
- You know what you are?
- A realtor?

20:45.337 --> 20:48.488
- You're a nosey parker.
- And you're a bitch.

20:49.297 --> 20:51.288
Did I hit a nerve?

20:52.497 --> 20:54.488
I don't have any nerves.

20:54.537 --> 20:56.095
How about you?

20:57.497 --> 20:59.488
We'll see.

21:01.897 --> 21:07.449
Look, I got a quaint,
turn-of-the-century rat-hole to show,

21:07.497 --> 21:09.453
unless you got evidence to book me.

21:09.497 --> 21:12.773
Go with God, Richard.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.091
You have to let him back on the street?

21:26.137 --> 21:29.288
You gave it your best shot.
It didn't work this time.

21:29.337 --> 21:31.612
We'll get him back. And when we do...

21:38.737 --> 21:43.288
Two things. Desault's dead. Canadians
found him colder than a witch's boob

21:43.337 --> 21:46.647
in a shack in Moosonee, Canada.
OD'd on skag.

21:46.697 --> 21:48.494
- Poor guy.
- Poor guy?

21:48.537 --> 21:51.973
Imagine trying to score smack
in a place called Moosonee.

21:52.017 --> 21:54.451
Must've been hell. Easier to cop yak turds.

21:54.497 --> 21:57.648
With Desault dead,
White's our lead contestant.

21:57.697 --> 21:59.289
What's the other thing?

21:59.337 --> 22:02.056
I had a guy I know look into White-Phillips.

22:02.097 --> 22:05.328
- They sell houses and make loans.
- I thought that was legal.

22:05.377 --> 22:07.652
It is. But they deal with low-income people

22:07.697 --> 22:10.211
who don't read fine print.
70% get foreclosed.

22:10.257 --> 22:13.294
Most of their income
is from high interest and penalties.

22:13.337 --> 22:15.897
The loan division makes
much more than realty.

22:15.937 --> 22:19.896
- They profit selling foreclosures?
- Only the loan division.

22:19.937 --> 22:24.294
They own the foreclosures.
And Phillips is not a partner in Loans.

22:24.337 --> 22:27.488
So she pulls down squat
compared to White.

22:31.097 --> 22:34.487
We just wanna see
Kimberley Phillips' bank account,

22:34.537 --> 22:37.495
and Richard White's and the company's.

22:37.537 --> 22:40.893
Would you like to open an account
yourself while you're at it?

22:40.937 --> 22:44.247
- Maybe get a free toaster?
- We could get a warrant.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.889
Sounds like a good idea.

22:45.937 --> 22:48.087
It might not sound such good idea

22:48.137 --> 22:51.095
when you have detectives
swarming all over your bank.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.890
- Looking for what?
- Russian mob laundering,

22:53.937 --> 22:57.293
drug money, whatever.
You don't want to go there.

22:58.897 --> 23:01.127
I'll punch them up.

23:01.177 --> 23:04.692
Phillips deposits a pay-cheque
from White-Phillips every week

23:04.737 --> 23:06.693
- and she deposits cash.
- How much?

23:06.737 --> 23:08.489
Three grand cash every week.

23:08.537 --> 23:13.486
White Loan Company withdraws three
grand a week, puts it under expenses.

23:13.537 --> 23:16.495
That's the perk Phillips gets.
Tax-free income.

23:16.537 --> 23:18.687
Three grand a week under the table.

23:18.737 --> 23:23.288
I could send my kids to private school and
still save 50 bucks a week, college fund.

23:23.337 --> 23:25.293
Stabler.

23:26.897 --> 23:31.846
No Kimberley Phillips, huh?
Got any other names there? Thanks a lot.

23:31.897 --> 23:35.287
- What is it?
- Print-out from the lock box.

23:35.337 --> 23:37.897
Does it work how she said?
Is her name on it?

23:37.937 --> 23:40.087
Er, no. His name is.

23:40.137 --> 23:42.697
She's carrying around White's beeper.

23:43.497 --> 23:45.294
Let's talk to her again.

23:45.337 --> 23:48.693
We don't care about financial dealings,
that's for the IRS.

23:48.737 --> 23:53.288
And we don't care about the IRS,
unless you're not willing to talk.

23:55.897 --> 23:59.094
The way I described the partnership
wasn't accurate.

23:59.137 --> 24:01.093
OK. So, what did you leave out?

24:01.137 --> 24:04.812
From the start, he told me
we'd deal with low-income clients,

24:04.857 --> 24:06.688
finding a legal way to rip them off.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.297
That didn't sit well, so I turned him down.

24:09.337 --> 24:11.851
Super. You've got a conscience. So?

24:11.897 --> 24:15.094
He didn't take my refusal
as easily as I'd said.

24:15.137 --> 24:17.697
He got a really frightening look in his eye.

24:17.737 --> 24:20.490
I thought he was gonna hit me
in front of the brokers.

24:20.537 --> 24:24.496
Then he pulled himself together.
I got the flowers the next day.

24:24.537 --> 24:27.847
- And?
- He had no way of knowing my address.

24:27.897 --> 24:29.888
That scared me.

24:29.937 --> 24:34.488
Hardly a beautiful friendship. You're
frightened, you think he's following you.

24:34.537 --> 24:37.893
When I agreed to the partnership,
he followed me to an open house.

24:37.937 --> 24:39.290
I saw in the mirror.

24:39.337 --> 24:44.092
- You could've called the cops.
- Huh! Well, they blew me off.

24:44.897 --> 24:46.888
There's no law against what he did.

24:46.937 --> 24:51.089
There's some harassment law
but you have to say you fear for your life

24:51.137 --> 24:54.447
or that you've been threatened.
He was offering me a job.

24:54.497 --> 24:57.694
A job that pays you
150 grand per annum tax free.

24:57.737 --> 25:00.490
I'm sure that took the edge off your fear.

25:01.297 --> 25:03.811
Yeah. OK.

25:03.857 --> 25:07.293
He used that to make you provide
an alibi for the Fitzgerald rape.

25:07.337 --> 25:11.967
He told you to use his beeper
to open that lock box, didn't he?

25:13.297 --> 25:18.246
You knew his history. You'd been
in the courtroom with Fitzgerald.

25:18.297 --> 25:21.892
- You had to have put it together.
- I did.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.895
He threatened to kill me if I said anything

25:25.697 --> 25:27.415
and I knew that he would.

25:31.897 --> 25:34.695
I'm getting a warrant for Mr White.

25:38.697 --> 25:40.688
Two bags, please.

25:41.897 --> 25:45.492
Have this developed
and run this through the ESDA machine.

25:45.537 --> 25:48.495
Pull up all the writings on the page above it.

25:48.537 --> 25:51.495
Check this out. A map of Central Park.

25:51.537 --> 25:55.689
He's circled the Ramble.
It's got dates and times written all over it.

25:55.737 --> 25:57.693
All the times are about the same.

25:57.737 --> 26:00.297
That date and time. The Fitzgerald rape.

26:00.337 --> 26:04.296
You got it. Look.
All the other dates and times

26:04.337 --> 26:06.487
are all prior to the rape.

26:06.537 --> 26:10.052
I'm guessing she was there
and he was stalking her.

26:10.097 --> 26:11.496
Thank you.

26:11.537 --> 26:15.530
Chains And Sluts, Whips And Spikes,
Whores On The Rack.

26:15.577 --> 26:18.296
This stuff makes
de Sade read like Beatrix Potter.

26:18.337 --> 26:20.328
Fits his need to control.

26:20.377 --> 26:23.892
I should get Forensics in my house
once a week, just to clean up.

26:23.937 --> 26:26.895
I checked his closets.
Lot of hangers. Few clothes.

26:26.937 --> 26:29.895
Did you find a.44
or evidence that he owns one?

26:29.937 --> 26:30.926
Nada.

26:30.977 --> 26:36.290
Just found a picture of Louise Billings,
the date-rape vic, in his freezer. No food.

26:36.337 --> 26:40.296
White knew we'd come. Practically
dared us to bust him at the station.

26:40.337 --> 26:43.488
He's gone. He's gone for good.

26:44.697 --> 26:48.053
I got a list of empty
White-Phillips foreclosures.

26:48.097 --> 26:49.894
We got uniforms looking at 'em.

26:49.937 --> 26:52.895
- Maybe he'll turn up.
- That's the idea.

26:52.937 --> 26:54.893
- Hey, Benson?
- Yeah?

26:54.937 --> 26:59.055
I hear you may be in his sights,
after you squared off in interrogation.

26:59.097 --> 27:01.452
He's just trying to mess with my head.

27:01.497 --> 27:05.490
Yeah, well...
everyone at SVU has got your back.

27:08.097 --> 27:11.134
- Thanks, John.
- Need a lift home?

27:11.177 --> 27:14.294
I'm waiting for Elliot
to get back from Forensics.

27:14.337 --> 27:16.692
Just as well, I didn't bring my car.

27:18.697 --> 27:22.690
Hey, John.
Electrostatic Detection Apparatus report.

27:22.737 --> 27:25.297
- What the hell's that?
- ESDA.

27:25.337 --> 27:27.453
I never knew what it stood for either.

27:27.497 --> 27:31.854
It pulled up the writing off the pad
from White's. Didn't give us much.

27:31.897 --> 27:34.092
- What's it got?
- A list of places.

27:34.137 --> 27:37.095
Gym, laundry, pharmacy, grocery store.

27:37.137 --> 27:41.289
Called them all, see if Fitzgerald
used any of 'em. She didn't.

27:47.697 --> 27:49.688
This is your gym,

27:49.737 --> 27:51.056
your laundry,

27:51.097 --> 27:53.088
your grocery store.

28:10.697 --> 28:12.892
- Who is it?
- Elliot.

28:13.737 --> 28:17.093
Hi. A neighbour let me in.
I was nearby. I'll give you a lift.

28:17.137 --> 28:20.766
Elliot, what's going on?
Last night Munch offered me a lift home.

28:20.817 --> 28:23.377
- Munch did?
- Yeah, that's not like him.

28:23.417 --> 28:26.568
Now you offer to drive me to work?
In the neighbourhood?

28:26.617 --> 28:29.051
- I was.
- You have a sedan with you?

28:29.097 --> 28:32.567
So you drove uptown
from the Queensborough Bridge,

28:32.617 --> 28:36.405
dropped off the car, picked up
the sedan, turned downtown to get here.

28:36.457 --> 28:40.496
- That's a lot of neighbourhood.
- Stop acting like a cop.

28:41.097 --> 28:44.089
That's what Richard White
would like me to do.

28:44.697 --> 28:49.373
I appreciate everyone's concern
but we don't know White's coming for me.

28:49.417 --> 28:51.806
- He may have left town.
- OK.

28:54.697 --> 28:57.495
- I wouldn't drive to Queens for you.
- You would.

28:57.537 --> 29:00.688
Only cos you have a wife and kids.

29:00.737 --> 29:02.295
Yeah.

29:03.697 --> 29:05.494
Stabler.

29:06.897 --> 29:08.489
We'll be right there.

29:12.497 --> 29:17.207
- Lopez, Homicide.
- Benson. Stabler. What happened?

29:17.257 --> 29:20.693
Neighbour heard shots fired.
Called it in an hour ago.

29:20.737 --> 29:24.286
We found one of your cards here.
Thought you'd wanna know.

29:24.337 --> 29:26.487
- Where is she?
- The bedroom.

29:27.897 --> 29:29.933
I couldn't say for sure.

29:29.977 --> 29:33.686
This was cold. Ugly.
Do you know who might be involved?

29:33.737 --> 29:35.693
Your guess is as good as ours.

29:36.897 --> 29:41.527
- You recover any spent rounds?
- Not yet. Casings from a.44.

29:41.577 --> 29:44.375
When you take them
and any rounds to Forensics,

29:44.417 --> 29:48.171
check if they came from the same gun
that did Karen Fitzgerald.

29:48.217 --> 29:51.892
- Got a perp in mind?
- Richard White. He raped her once.

29:51.937 --> 29:54.326
We're waiting on an ME
but no sign of rape here.

29:54.377 --> 29:57.494
- Mind if we talk to your witness?
- This way.

29:58.097 --> 30:01.487
Mr Cummings? Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

30:01.537 --> 30:05.928
- What did you do after you heard shots?
- Nothing at first.

30:05.977 --> 30:09.686
You know how you read in the papers
it sounded like firecrackers?

30:09.737 --> 30:13.696
It sounded like firecrackers.
I was about to go back to bed.

30:13.737 --> 30:15.773
- But you didn't?
- No.

30:15.817 --> 30:19.696
After the shooting,
I heard a man's voice say, 'Bitch.'

30:19.737 --> 30:21.693
These walls are paper thin.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.535
So I went to my door
and looked through the peephole.

30:24.577 --> 30:26.169
What did you see?

30:26.217 --> 30:29.892
A stocky guy. 40s maybe,
headed for the stairs.

30:29.937 --> 30:32.292
- You saw his face?
- Yeah.

30:32.337 --> 30:36.296
He turned, looked directly at my door.
Like he could see through it.

30:37.297 --> 30:39.970
- That's him. Only, er...
- Only what?

30:40.697 --> 30:42.733
He don't look so nuts in the picture.

30:46.297 --> 30:49.095
OK. Thank you, Mr Cummings,
for your help.

30:49.137 --> 30:52.288
Call SVU. We'll give you
what we've got on White.

30:52.337 --> 30:55.295
- Got an extra photo?
- Plenty to go around.

30:55.337 --> 30:59.046
Should've seen it coming.
White had her picture in his freezer.

30:59.097 --> 31:01.452
It wasn't thawing. He was fixed on her.

31:01.497 --> 31:03.089
You're not serious?

31:03.137 --> 31:06.686
Could've offered protection.
It's our job. Protecting, serving.

31:06.737 --> 31:10.491
If there were 8 million of us in the city,
everyone could sleep at night.

31:10.537 --> 31:14.610
Are you gonna sleep tonight, Elliot?
Or are you gonna think about her?

31:14.657 --> 31:17.490
We got uniforms and Homicide
looking for White.

31:17.537 --> 31:21.496
Let's think about co-operation for a change.
Total co-operation.

31:21.537 --> 31:25.052
We don't need the glory,
we need White off the streets.

31:25.097 --> 31:26.894
- Jeffries, Briscoe.
- Yeah?

31:26.937 --> 31:29.849
Get some uniforms.
Recheck the empty foreclosures.

31:29.897 --> 31:31.694
List's at the sergeant's desk.

31:31.737 --> 31:35.889
Munch, Cassidy. Help throw up a wall
around Phillips. Keep at her.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.849
Maybe there's some friend or enemy
she's forgotten.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.889
She gives you anything,
you leave people with her.

31:41.937 --> 31:44.895
Benson. You got a second?

31:46.497 --> 31:50.046
- What?
- I don't want you out there today.

31:50.097 --> 31:52.895
- I need to be out there.
- You've pissed him off.

31:52.937 --> 31:56.486
He's focused on you. If he's in the city,
you could be on his list.

31:56.537 --> 31:59.893
- I need to watch Elliot.
- We'll get him someone else.

31:59.937 --> 32:05.295
Captain, when I first came on board here
you told me that I don't get to pick the vic.

32:05.337 --> 32:07.487
So now I'm the next potential vic.

32:07.537 --> 32:11.212
The same rule should still apply.
Let me do my job.

32:14.097 --> 32:17.533
- I want you back here safe tonight.
- OK.

32:18.897 --> 32:21.286
All right, everybody, let's move out.

32:23.897 --> 32:26.172
- Is Olivia Benson here?
- I'm Benson.

32:26.897 --> 32:30.731
Two dozen roses.
Your boyfriend must really love you.

32:35.297 --> 32:37.857
'No hard feelings.'

32:37.897 --> 32:39.489
Where do you work?

32:39.537 --> 32:42.495
Here we go.
Charged to the credit card of Lila White.

32:42.537 --> 32:45.495
Lila White? Are you sure?

32:45.537 --> 32:47.687
Yeah. Credit card went through.

32:47.737 --> 32:51.093
Platinum card. Those bastards
take a hunk of my profits.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.697
- You got an address on this?
- Sure.

32:56.897 --> 32:59.013
What time did your son get here?

32:59.057 --> 33:01.093
Around 9:00am.

33:01.137 --> 33:03.935
He looked dishevelled, harried.

33:03.977 --> 33:06.650
He also wanted to borrow some money.

33:06.697 --> 33:10.690
That's generally when I see him,
when he wants money. He's a taker.

33:10.737 --> 33:14.889
- Did he say why he needed it?
- I assume because he had none.

33:15.897 --> 33:20.334
Richard's never been good with money.
He learnt from his father.

33:20.377 --> 33:22.333
- Is his father here?
- Dead.

33:23.297 --> 33:25.208
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

33:26.617 --> 33:29.689
Richard uses his father's death to use me.

33:29.737 --> 33:33.650
To play on guilt he thinks I feel
because his father killed himself.

33:33.697 --> 33:37.087
- When did that happen?
- Five years ago last week.

33:37.137 --> 33:38.889
His father was a taker, too.

33:38.937 --> 33:42.054
- I've told him since he was a boy.
- Told him what?

33:42.097 --> 33:45.487
I thought he needed
to know how the world worked.

33:45.537 --> 33:48.495
He needed to grab control,
take things for himself.

33:48.537 --> 33:52.291
- And yet you still give him money.
- Well...

33:53.497 --> 33:55.692
He is my son, after all.

33:56.497 --> 33:58.727
Did he say where he was going
when he left?

33:58.777 --> 34:03.089
To Manhattan. He was going
to look up a special lady friend.

34:04.097 --> 34:08.136
A policewoman. Huh.
I told him he should drop her

34:08.177 --> 34:10.168
before she started taking from him.

34:10.217 --> 34:14.335
No offence. I understand that you
people don't make any real money.

34:14.377 --> 34:18.813
And for that you get to deal with filth. All day.

34:19.897 --> 34:21.774
All shapes and sizes.

34:25.016 --> 34:28.487
- I'll walk you in.
- I know how to protect myself.

34:28.536 --> 34:31.847
- I'm not a civilian.
- You're not a superhero either.

34:31.897 --> 34:35.525
Elliot, if I let White change
my life in any way, he wins.

34:35.577 --> 34:38.045
- I won't let him win.
- It's not about winning.

34:38.097 --> 34:41.567
- Yeah, it is.
- Blink the lights when you're in.

34:42.697 --> 34:46.212
You're gonna sit here all night until I do.
Stubborn son of a bitch.

34:46.257 --> 34:47.895
Yes, I am.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.688
See you tomorrow.

35:25.097 --> 35:26.894
Oh, God.

35:28.897 --> 35:30.489
Benson.

35:30.537 --> 35:32.289
'Hi, Olivia.'

35:33.897 --> 35:35.489
Where are you?

35:35.537 --> 35:38.688
'I wanna see you. Talk to you.

35:38.737 --> 35:44.289
'I know you wanna see me.
You've been trying all day. Let's meet.'

35:44.337 --> 35:48.888
- Where?
- 'Hm. Somewhere you feel safe.'

35:48.937 --> 35:52.691
- The station house.
- ' Funny.'

35:53.497 --> 35:57.888
'Make it the Ramble.
A bench that brings back fond memories.'

35:57.937 --> 36:00.292
'You know the one. 7:00am.'

36:01.337 --> 36:04.886
- Don't be late.
- 'Olivia, I'm not a fool.

36:04.937 --> 36:09.692
'If I see one cop,
we'll never consummate our relationship.'

36:49.257 --> 36:51.851
Run, bitch!

36:51.897 --> 36:56.129
- Drop it, freak, now! Drop it!
- On the ground, White! Get down.

36:57.537 --> 37:01.576
- Just turn over and shut up.
- You lying, coward bitch.

37:06.897 --> 37:09.775
- He wants to confess.
- All right. Let's do it.

37:10.497 --> 37:14.490
No. He wants to play my reactions
while he's doing it.

37:14.537 --> 37:17.097
- He'll get off on that.
- Which is good.

37:17.137 --> 37:20.095
He thinks with the wrong head,
you get the advantage.

37:20.137 --> 37:21.889
OK. Hey. The gun.

37:21.937 --> 37:24.656
- He's gotta cop to using the gun.
- Got it.

37:26.097 --> 37:29.214
Olivia. I was wondering.
I thought you stood me up.

37:29.257 --> 37:32.454
Course not. I just had
some things to take care of.

37:32.497 --> 37:35.216
Make-up? Hair? You look nice.

37:35.257 --> 37:36.849
Thank you.

37:36.897 --> 37:39.047
So, you wanted to talk?

37:39.097 --> 37:42.248
Yes. I was wondering, though,
how's your mother?

37:44.497 --> 37:47.694
- Fine. How's yours?
- You met her.

37:47.737 --> 37:50.297
The classic refrigerator mother.

37:50.337 --> 37:53.090
About your mother, though. Serena, isn't it?

37:53.137 --> 37:56.174
Is she still carrying around
scars from that rape?

37:56.217 --> 38:01.086
- Is she still having nightmares?
- Let's talk about Karen Fitzgerald.

38:01.137 --> 38:04.493
One-track mind. Compulsive.
Good for you.

38:04.537 --> 38:06.289
How'd it happen?

38:06.337 --> 38:09.090
We had a history. You know.
So did you, I hear.

38:09.137 --> 38:11.890
Yeah, I knew her.
She was smart, competent.

38:11.937 --> 38:14.292
Not really. Not like you.

38:14.897 --> 38:18.890
She liked to read in the Ramble.
Same time, same day, every week.

38:19.497 --> 38:22.489
- That must've made it easy for you.
- Too easy.

38:22.537 --> 38:24.926
Too easy? Then why stalk her?

38:24.977 --> 38:28.094
Stalk? That's sort of purple, isn't it?

38:28.137 --> 38:32.096
We both went to a place
we thought was safe, picturesque.

38:32.137 --> 38:36.096
Filled with bird-watchers relaxing.
Do you relax?

38:37.097 --> 38:38.974
I mean, seeing what you see,

38:39.017 --> 38:42.896
knowing how the world is,
how bizarre and ugly it is.

38:43.697 --> 38:45.892
Yeah, I relax.

38:45.937 --> 38:47.893
Oh.

38:47.937 --> 38:50.451
Bath.

38:50.497 --> 38:52.488
Chanting.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.294
Yoga.

38:57.697 --> 39:01.485
So, she didn't hear me sneak up behind her.

39:01.537 --> 39:05.530
She struggled a bit. That's hard
with somebody squeezing your trachea.

39:05.577 --> 39:09.729
It sounds a bit like
Styrofoam peanuts crunching.

39:09.777 --> 39:13.087
- That's very descriptive.
- Thank you.

39:13.137 --> 39:16.174
In the clearing I picked up a rock.
I showed it to her.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.888
Hit her with it. She yelped.

39:18.937 --> 39:22.646
She didn't scream.
She yelped like a whipped dog.

39:22.697 --> 39:27.851
I made her crawl to me and ask
my forgiveness for what she did to me.

39:27.897 --> 39:31.367
- What did she do to you again?
- In court. She embarrassed me.

39:31.417 --> 39:34.807
- Oh, right.
- She made a gurgling sound.

39:34.857 --> 39:37.690
I took that for an apology. I accepted.

39:37.737 --> 39:41.286
Then I took her. I think she liked it.
What do you think?

39:41.337 --> 39:44.488
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- It does to me.

39:45.297 --> 39:49.290
You're still listening. Must be
something you enjoy about my story.

39:49.337 --> 39:51.692
Maybe something's lacking.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.376
I know.

39:54.417 --> 39:58.933
You want me to say I killed her.
You need that detail to kill me.

40:02.697 --> 40:08.294
- Did you kill her?
- I had a knife and I cut her.

40:08.337 --> 40:13.695
And I watched her blood
seep into the ground, taking her life with it.

40:18.857 --> 40:21.212
He'll never say he used the gun.

40:21.257 --> 40:24.294
Without that,
he could duck the death penalty.

40:24.337 --> 40:28.888
- Probably tossed it in the Hudson.
- You look disappointed, Olivia.

40:28.937 --> 40:31.167
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

40:33.097 --> 40:34.689
Just, erm...

40:36.697 --> 40:40.212
tell me once more. How'd you kill her?

40:42.897 --> 40:44.888
Thrill-seeker.

40:44.937 --> 40:49.408
No. I'm through.
Do what you can with what you got.

40:50.097 --> 40:53.851
I don't think you can kill me with it. Pity.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.488
I'm fixed on you.

40:59.497 --> 41:03.615
And until I'm dead,
I'll always be in your head.

41:03.657 --> 41:06.888
Just like your mother
