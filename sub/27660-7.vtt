WEBVTT

00:04.550 --> 00:06.553
Previously on "Future Man."

00:06.554 --> 00:08.891
Supreme Overlord
Vice is dead.

00:08.892 --> 00:12.022
Long live
Supreme Overlord Torque.

00:12.023 --> 00:14.276
You're smasher now.
Smash everything in this pile

00:14.277 --> 00:15.655
before the sun
hits the third hole.

00:15.656 --> 00:17.199
I'm not gonna go play house

00:17.200 --> 00:19.955
while Josh is still in danger.

00:19.956 --> 00:22.042
I've got to get to Athena
and get that TTD back,

00:22.043 --> 00:24.296
otherwise we're stuck
in this shit timeline forever.

00:24.297 --> 00:28.054
Where is my TTD,
you fucking dick scab.

00:28.055 --> 00:29.431
You need to move up
the launch.

00:29.432 --> 00:31.979
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.275
I need access to
all your security footage.

00:34.276 --> 00:37.030
Athena was operating this whole
time right under your nose.

00:37.031 --> 00:39.034
Would this be helpful?

00:42.918 --> 00:44.169
This is the most
fuel I could find

00:44.170 --> 00:45.965
on such short
notice.

00:45.966 --> 00:49.179
How much did you get?

00:49.180 --> 00:50.808
Everything I could scrounge.

00:50.809 --> 00:52.895
For the next test,
I'll double the plutonium.

00:52.896 --> 00:55.569
- Triple it.
- But my ovaries.

00:56.821 --> 00:58.364
Damn your ovaries.

00:58.365 --> 01:00.911
We need to attack Stu now.

01:00.912 --> 01:02.623
This is our last chance.

01:02.624 --> 01:04.794
Without J1,
this time machine

01:04.795 --> 01:06.548
is the only way we're
getting another Joosh.

01:06.549 --> 01:09.136
I'm a neuroscientist,
not a nuclear physicist.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.767
Oh, well, I would've asked
one of our other scientists,

01:11.768 --> 01:14.188
but they're all dead in a cave.

01:14.189 --> 01:15.775
Just saying,

01:15.776 --> 01:17.987
if they find you,
you might want a backup plan.

01:17.988 --> 01:20.994
Don't worry,
I have one.

01:40.992 --> 01:43.246
- What do you got?
- A break.

01:43.247 --> 01:45.835
Using facial recognition,
I pinpointed a location

01:45.836 --> 01:47.964
where all the Pointed Circle
members intersected

01:47.965 --> 01:50.553
before dropping off my grid.
There's not a lot out there.

01:50.554 --> 01:52.389
Mostly storage units,

01:52.390 --> 01:54.309
and two klicks further
you're in cannibal country.

01:54.310 --> 01:57.357
Ah, you guys have cannibals
in this timeline too.

01:57.358 --> 01:59.278
Desperate people
will eat each other.

01:59.279 --> 02:00.614
Yeah.

02:00.615 --> 02:04.037
Yeah, they really will.

02:04.038 --> 02:06.125
Ah, you should talk
to Jeff Breakfast,

02:06.126 --> 02:07.503
he runs the storage facilities
out there.

02:07.504 --> 02:09.298
- Okay, copy that.
- Yeah.

02:09.299 --> 02:11.177
Jeffy Breaks.

02:11.178 --> 02:13.055
Got a few more for sale out there.

02:13.056 --> 02:14.934
Gonna go quick.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.688
Keep it tight, Shears.

02:16.689 --> 02:18.650
This is for
the official portrait.

02:25.791 --> 02:28.754
Yeah.

02:28.755 --> 02:31.635
Now they have to respect me.

02:31.636 --> 02:35.099
Mm.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.062
- Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.
- Oh, God.

02:37.063 --> 02:38.732
You got to help me, okay?
The--the--they're coming

02:38.733 --> 02:41.111
for the--they're after me.
They're after me.

02:41.112 --> 02:42.782
The Pointed Circle
is inside the NAG.

02:42.783 --> 02:44.284
Rogue smasher.

02:44.285 --> 02:46.748
- Here you are.
- Oh, God.

02:50.674 --> 02:51.758
My apologies, Your Eminence.

02:51.759 --> 02:53.344
- Eminence?
- Yeah.

02:53.345 --> 02:55.431
But this one still owes
a debt in the smash pits.

02:55.432 --> 02:56.518
No, no, no, Wolf,
I can't go back there.

02:56.519 --> 02:57.937
It's not safe.

02:57.938 --> 03:00.066
Smash pit is a publicly held
entity,

03:00.067 --> 03:02.279
requiring a--an open forum

03:02.280 --> 03:04.909
and 2/3 majority
to commute your service.

03:04.910 --> 03:07.122
Or failing that,

03:07.123 --> 03:08.959
a stampede of yellow ants

03:08.960 --> 03:11.923
followed by
a carrot-colored wind.

03:11.924 --> 03:14.721
Wolf, you're reading
from a bean husk.

03:14.722 --> 03:16.516
An airtight bean husk.

03:16.517 --> 03:18.144
My hands are tied here.

03:18.145 --> 03:20.440
I can't amend this thing
until the next blood moon,

03:20.441 --> 03:23.404
so, you know.

03:23.405 --> 03:25.618
Okay. Wolf,
I can't go back there, okay?

03:25.619 --> 03:27.078
If I go back there,
they will kill me.

03:27.079 --> 03:28.456
They already attacked me
one time.

03:28.457 --> 03:29.959
I am a sitting duck.
It's not safe.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.924
Please, please.

03:34.177 --> 03:36.013
Look,

03:36.014 --> 03:38.225
Your Honorable Pit Boss,

03:38.226 --> 03:41.816
maybe you and I can come
to an understanding.

03:58.935 --> 04:00.938
Uh, oh.

04:00.939 --> 04:02.775
No, don't know her.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.612
All right, so you haven't
seen anyone coming or going?

04:04.613 --> 04:06.240
No, no one ever comes here.

04:06.241 --> 04:08.244
They store their
priceless possessions

04:08.245 --> 04:10.164
and then just kind of
forgot about them.

04:10.165 --> 04:12.670
- Mm.
- Kind of like me.

04:12.671 --> 04:16.385
You know, I--I don't
have another person that I--

04:16.386 --> 04:19.851
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
- I get it, you're sad.

04:19.852 --> 04:21.563
So, I'm gonna go
check things out.

04:21.564 --> 04:23.315
Um, you want--
you need some company?

04:23.316 --> 04:25.319
No.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.614
I know where
most everything--

04:26.615 --> 04:28.618
- No.
- Still no.

04:43.482 --> 04:44.901
Wha...

04:44.902 --> 04:46.946
Son of a...

04:49.745 --> 04:52.415
There goes the element of
surprise, you dumb slunt.

04:52.416 --> 04:54.127
That's--that's not
how you use that word.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.006
What're you doing here?

04:56.007 --> 04:59.137
Um, well, you said that you
were gonna leave after this,

04:59.138 --> 05:01.225
and then I thought,
Maybe this could be our chance

05:01.226 --> 05:04.649
to bond, you know, like we
non-verbally talked about.

05:04.650 --> 05:06.485
Oh, right, yeah,
when you tried to kill me?

05:06.486 --> 05:09.324
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That was a nice moment.

05:09.325 --> 05:11.788
Okay, sure.
You wanna help?

05:11.789 --> 05:13.374
All right.
Why don't you, uh,

05:13.375 --> 05:15.796
- check out this area over here.
- Okay.

05:15.797 --> 05:17.758
- Do I get a cheddar blade?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:17.759 --> 05:19.929
I got your cheddar blade
right here.

05:21.266 --> 05:23.269
Yeah, that did it.

05:26.652 --> 05:28.655
Ah.

06:17.879 --> 06:20.551
- Ugh.
- Ah.

06:22.471 --> 06:25.560
- You're too late.
- The trail ends here.

06:25.561 --> 06:29.484
Oh, Eunice, why did you have
to go and do that?

06:29.485 --> 06:32.574
'Cause you were gonna
torture me for my secrets,

06:32.575 --> 06:34.160
and I didn't want you to.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.789
Yeah, well, you got me there.

06:37.209 --> 06:40.464
- God damn it.
- Tell me where my TTD is.

06:40.465 --> 06:41.968
- What?
- Time travel device.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.847
Well, that's a dumb name.

06:43.848 --> 06:46.268
Really, that's what you wanna
waste your last breath on?

06:47.856 --> 06:49.650
Yeah.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.549
Yeah, I remember
my first dead body.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.177
I was four.
Half a person

07:03.178 --> 07:05.766
just fell from the sky
during a drone-ado.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.895
I know what you're thinking.
Was it the top

07:07.896 --> 07:10.567
or the bottom half?
But it was neither.

07:10.568 --> 07:13.405
It was just right down
the middle, vertical slice.

07:13.406 --> 07:17.581
She was the closest thing
I had to a mother.

07:17.582 --> 07:18.833
You'll get used to it.

07:18.834 --> 07:20.377
You know,
by the time I was six,

07:20.378 --> 07:22.841
we even built training grounds
out of the dead.

07:24.053 --> 07:25.764
The Obstacle Corpse.

07:25.765 --> 07:28.393
- This is a full-on hideout.
- Yeah.

07:28.394 --> 07:30.899
And there were a ton of
footprints by the exit.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.487
So are you sure you didn't see
anyone coming or going?

07:33.488 --> 07:35.199
- No, I've been here all day.
- I didn't see anything.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.540
- No, you're bad at your job.
- Okay, I--I just...

07:38.541 --> 07:41.253
This job is all I have.
I don't wanna die.

07:41.254 --> 07:43.382
So now

07:43.383 --> 07:46.681
that the one thing you
were looking for is...

07:46.682 --> 07:49.018
dead,

07:49.019 --> 07:50.730
does that mean
that you're leaving?

07:50.731 --> 07:53.820
- Okay.
- You see this finger?

07:53.821 --> 07:55.574
This is
my "stop talking" finger,

07:55.575 --> 07:57.995
- so when you see this finger...
- Uh?

07:57.996 --> 07:59.414
You stop talking.

07:59.415 --> 08:01.251
The art of investigation

08:01.252 --> 08:04.465
is in the silent observations.

08:04.466 --> 08:06.971
All right?

08:06.972 --> 08:10.729
There's more than one set
of footprints here.

08:10.730 --> 08:13.610
Hmm, there's a white powder
over here.

08:17.619 --> 08:19.788
Sedimentary.

08:19.789 --> 08:21.291
A little limestone.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.753
Very old.

08:22.754 --> 08:26.719
Question is,
Why would someone

08:26.720 --> 08:29.642
walk in ancient stone dust?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.896
Ooh, ooh, I know.

08:31.897 --> 08:34.150
Tell me.

08:34.151 --> 08:35.361
Mm.

08:35.362 --> 08:37.950
Ugh. Fine.

08:39.663 --> 08:42.960
You can come with me.

08:42.961 --> 08:47.426
Strays are wild and dangerous
and unpredictable outsiders.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.807
How could you even think of
letting someone like that

08:49.808 --> 08:51.476
- near our Lugnut?
- Okay, okay.

08:51.477 --> 08:55.234
I'm--I'm hearing your concerns,
but this stray is

08:55.235 --> 08:56.862
special.

08:56.863 --> 08:59.117
I know him.

08:59.118 --> 09:01.288
In prison, he was my friend.

09:01.289 --> 09:04.920
He gave me a rock hammer
and I used it to dig a hole,

09:04.921 --> 09:08.010
bit by bit every night,
to make my escape.

09:08.011 --> 09:09.345
How did they
not see the hole?

09:09.346 --> 09:11.057
Oh, well, that
was the great part.

09:11.058 --> 09:13.771
He also gave me a sexy poster
to hang on the wall

09:13.772 --> 09:14.898
to cover the hole.

09:14.899 --> 09:16.986
They let you have a poster?

09:16.987 --> 09:18.656
That seems implausible.

09:18.657 --> 09:20.535
Well, I helped them out
with their taxes.

09:20.536 --> 09:22.246
But,
that's not important.

09:22.247 --> 09:26.171
Look,
what is important is

09:26.172 --> 09:27.591
that stray outside.

09:29.638 --> 09:31.515
He was my redemption.

09:46.337 --> 09:49.175
Just give him a chance.

09:49.176 --> 09:51.764
He's good stray.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.392
You won't even know he's here.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.812
Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.

09:54.813 --> 09:56.565
Drones dropping pamphlets
from the sky.

09:56.566 --> 09:58.820
We have two days
to stop the attack.

09:58.821 --> 10:00.197
We're all gonna die.

10:03.329 --> 10:04.999
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:07.045 --> 10:09.382
Is this really necessary?

10:09.383 --> 10:11.094
You brought this on yourself.

10:11.095 --> 10:13.808
I was this close to getting you
a mat on the floor

10:13.809 --> 10:15.729
behind the cum bucket.

10:15.730 --> 10:18.066
You blew it, buddy.

10:18.067 --> 10:20.154
Per usual,
I have so many questions,

10:20.155 --> 10:21.907
but I'm only gonna
ask the one that matters.

10:21.908 --> 10:23.452
What are we planning to do

10:23.453 --> 10:25.456
about the Pointed Circle
attacking me last night?

10:25.457 --> 10:27.878
Who you think attacked you
last night.

10:27.879 --> 10:29.923
The de-bat got
everyone all worked up.

10:29.924 --> 10:32.011
Someone probably just saw you
talking to me.

10:32.012 --> 10:34.725
Old loyalties die hard.
They tried to murder you.

10:34.726 --> 10:37.062
- That's democracy in action.
- Mm.

10:37.063 --> 10:40.027
I was almost on the business
end of an assassin's arrow.

10:40.028 --> 10:42.616
From who?
No idea.

10:42.617 --> 10:45.120
- You see me freaking out? No.
- You should be.

10:45.121 --> 10:46.957
How can you even think that
we're safe here right now.

10:46.958 --> 10:49.045
Are you kidding me?

10:49.046 --> 10:51.801
Okay, okay.

10:51.802 --> 10:54.430
- I can see this is important.
- Yes.

10:54.431 --> 10:56.685
And I am committed
to being responsive

10:56.686 --> 11:01.403
to all my constituents of this
burgeoning modern city-state.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.582
You're writing
with a human bone pen.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.128
Investigate claims
of possible...

11:10.129 --> 11:14.263
- Definite.
- Internal terrorist activity.

11:15.891 --> 11:18.270
There you go.

11:18.271 --> 11:20.608
You--you don't even have
all the information.

11:20.609 --> 11:23.615
I have leads.
Red hair, resistance tattoo.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.707
I find your concern
disingenuous.

11:51.504 --> 11:53.966
Let's fuck up some art.

11:53.967 --> 11:55.469
Ooh.

11:55.470 --> 11:58.266
Right down the middle.

11:58.267 --> 11:59.811
Come on, fat baby head.

11:59.812 --> 12:02.901
Get a hole in one.

12:02.902 --> 12:05.238
Ah, you being way too easy
on that Raphael.

12:07.118 --> 12:10.332
See?
Ancient stone dust.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.963
Okay, these palookas couldn't
plop their way

12:12.964 --> 12:14.925
out of a circle wank.

12:14.926 --> 12:18.264
- Well, the evidence leads here.
- Told you.

12:18.265 --> 12:20.561
Ladies, what brings you
to Chez McGurgs?

12:20.562 --> 12:23.316
Okay, I got this.

12:23.317 --> 12:25.153
Get these chuckle fucks
out of here.

12:25.154 --> 12:27.491
Thad, Greg, come with me.

12:27.492 --> 12:28.828
We're gonna
make a slip 'n slide

12:28.829 --> 12:30.915
out of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Come on.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.796
- All right.
- Famous Tiger.

12:33.797 --> 12:35.382
You know, a lot of people
are wondering

12:35.383 --> 12:36.760
what you're doing here,
where you come from,

12:36.761 --> 12:38.430
how you exist.

12:38.431 --> 12:40.810
I'm a time traveler
from an alternate reality.

12:40.811 --> 12:42.689
Okay.

12:42.690 --> 12:44.233
Fly and coy.
Listen,

12:44.234 --> 12:45.778
as somebody who's been
in the public eye

12:45.779 --> 12:47.406
practically my whole life,

12:47.407 --> 12:49.326
I know what it's like
to be talked about.

12:49.327 --> 12:51.330
- Don't.
- I just wanna know

12:51.331 --> 12:52.667
how long you've been
smashing this stuff.

12:52.668 --> 12:54.546
As soon as Stu
moved up the launch.

12:54.547 --> 12:56.424
Can't take this stuff with us,
might as well have some fun.

12:56.425 --> 12:58.136
I don't know if this is
too forward, but, uh,

12:58.137 --> 13:00.641
would you like to take a dump
on the Constitution?

13:00.642 --> 13:03.271
- I got it in the bathroom.
- Hard pass.

13:03.272 --> 13:06.194
So, who's been
in and out of here?

13:06.195 --> 13:09.033
- Uh, the inner circle.
- Centurion deck and above.

13:09.034 --> 13:11.162
I'm Alpha Deck on
the Camillo One, obviously.

13:11.163 --> 13:13.208
Hey, Jimmy,
you guys still going?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.797
Brought my hammer.

13:17.300 --> 13:20.640
You're getting
a scorpion up your snatch.

13:20.641 --> 13:21.934
Shoe-Neck.

13:29.491 --> 13:32.329
Seems like old times,
huh, Jer Bear?

13:32.330 --> 13:35.001
Why don't you just tell me
where the TTD is

13:35.002 --> 13:37.924
and maybe this time
I'll let you keep your head.

13:37.925 --> 13:41.097
- Who's Jeri?
- I'm Geraldine.

13:41.098 --> 13:43.434
And I don't even know
what a TTD is.

13:43.435 --> 13:45.898
- It's a time travel device.
- Don't say it's a dumb name.

13:45.899 --> 13:49.071
- I won't.
- It's not in my nature.

13:49.072 --> 13:51.827
- Where's Jimmy?
- Jimmy can't help you now.

13:51.828 --> 13:54.456
He's scroll slippin'
with the ding dongs.

13:56.963 --> 13:58.757
I'm gonna hurt you, Jeri.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.761
'Cause I know that
no matter the timeline,

14:00.762 --> 14:03.266
you're a murderer and a liar,

14:03.267 --> 14:05.228
and you got
a real slunty face.

14:05.229 --> 14:06.940
That's not
how the word is used.

14:06.941 --> 14:09.028
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't speak Bio-Tech.

14:09.029 --> 14:10.865
Aren't you one too?

14:12.912 --> 14:15.750
Look, all right,
it seems like you're--

14:15.751 --> 14:17.670
you're going
through something right now,

14:17.671 --> 14:19.841
and you're using me
to work out your issues.

14:19.842 --> 14:21.637
Don't sympathize with me.

14:21.638 --> 14:23.348
Okay, what,
are you a therapist now?

14:23.349 --> 14:25.477
A therapist, yes, that is--
that is my vocation.

14:27.357 --> 14:30.403
Why don't you stop stalling
and tell me where the TTD is?

14:30.404 --> 14:32.533
- Stop.
- Tiger.

14:32.534 --> 14:34.663
Geraldine had
nothing to do with this.

14:34.664 --> 14:37.209
I'm getting answers, okay?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.298
And everyone knows that torture
is the most effective way

14:40.299 --> 14:42.720
to get the truth out of people.

14:42.721 --> 14:45.726
Mm.

14:45.727 --> 14:49.734
This has been about
your stupid time machine.

14:49.735 --> 14:53.366
You never cared about Stu
or getting to know me.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.328
No, not particularly.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.416
- See, see?
- Now that's hurtful, Tiger.

14:57.417 --> 15:00.840
You know, first,
I wanted to be more like you.

15:00.841 --> 15:02.677
But now,

15:02.678 --> 15:05.390
I think you might be
the worst version of me.

15:05.391 --> 15:06.935
Hah, no.

15:06.936 --> 15:08.438
You're the worst version of me.

15:08.439 --> 15:11.695
Worse versions ask
better versions for help.

15:11.696 --> 15:14.617
That's the--the rule of
versions.

15:14.618 --> 15:16.830
Mm-mm, you were getting
something out of it too.

15:16.831 --> 15:19.586
I was trying to fix you,
but you're a lost cause.

15:19.587 --> 15:21.172
This whole place
is a lost cause,

15:21.173 --> 15:22.884
which is why I'm bailing
on this timeline

15:22.885 --> 15:24.303
and I'm gonna find a new one.

15:24.304 --> 15:26.307
We all wanna
hit the reset button,

15:26.308 --> 15:28.061
but life doesn't give us
a machine to go back

15:28.062 --> 15:29.354
and fix all of our problems.

15:29.355 --> 15:31.025
Yep, it does.

15:31.026 --> 15:33.822
- And I'm trying to find mine.
- Mm.

15:33.823 --> 15:36.578
- No, you--that's my finger.
- You can't use my finger at me.

15:36.579 --> 15:39.876
Oh, I'm using it.

15:41.171 --> 15:42.840
How did those get here?

15:42.841 --> 15:44.426
The storage guy brought them
in this morning.

15:44.427 --> 15:46.138
You know,
the sad guy with access

15:46.139 --> 15:47.850
to his social anxiety disorder.

15:47.851 --> 15:50.856
Jeff Breakfast said he never
left his post today.

15:50.857 --> 15:52.442
Jeff Breakfast lied.

15:52.443 --> 15:55.198
Looks like someone
just cracked the case.

15:55.199 --> 15:57.620
- Come on, let's go.
- No, thanks.

15:57.621 --> 16:01.753
After today,
the last thing I want

16:01.754 --> 16:04.133
is to be more like you.

16:06.263 --> 16:08.266
Relationships are hard.

16:08.267 --> 16:09.644
Mm.

16:09.645 --> 16:12.316
Mm.

16:22.838 --> 16:25.801
Oh.

16:25.802 --> 16:28.014
I've never met
a stray before.

16:28.015 --> 16:30.018
Can I see your gills.

16:30.019 --> 16:31.646
My what now?

16:31.647 --> 16:33.567
Are you gonna steal
my hair to make a nest?

16:33.568 --> 16:37.073
No, that's--that's not...

16:37.074 --> 16:39.119
I'm just from out of town.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.123
I heard you only
have two parents.

16:41.124 --> 16:42.459
Yeah.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.505
Yeah, that part's true.

16:44.506 --> 16:48.012
Is that why you have a horn
growing out of your butt?

16:48.013 --> 16:50.225
Um...

16:50.226 --> 16:52.813
So do you know anyone
who looks like that?

16:52.814 --> 16:54.567
Any--anybody at all?

16:54.568 --> 16:57.155
Yeah, there are only five
ladies in NAG

16:57.156 --> 16:58.575
with hair like blood.

16:58.576 --> 17:00.078
- I know all them.
- You do?

17:00.079 --> 17:02.123
- I know everybody here.
- It's the face of the dad

17:02.124 --> 17:04.044
I pushed from my mind.

17:04.045 --> 17:05.798
- Cool.
- Cool.

17:05.799 --> 17:08.971
Uh, well, the one I'm looking
for, she, uh, cut her leg

17:08.972 --> 17:10.683
just about here,
so all I need you to do is--

17:10.684 --> 17:12.520
is see if any of those
blood-haired ladies

17:12.521 --> 17:14.398
are walking kind of funny
or something.

17:14.399 --> 17:16.528
Oh, well, if she's walking,
it's definitely not Trowel.

17:16.529 --> 17:19.408
- She has no legs.
- So we're down to four.

17:19.409 --> 17:22.372
You think you could, uh,
check 'em out for me?

17:22.373 --> 17:24.877
Sneak a peek?
Our little secret?

17:24.878 --> 17:26.673
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I could do that.

17:26.674 --> 17:28.552
That's great.

17:28.553 --> 17:30.138
Thank you.

17:35.399 --> 17:37.110
I'll be here.

17:52.183 --> 17:54.227
All right, it's breakfast time.

17:54.228 --> 17:56.482
Mm.

18:11.179 --> 18:12.973
Hi, Sweet Bean,
what you doin'?

18:12.974 --> 18:15.019
- Just practicing.
- For what?

18:15.020 --> 18:16.648
I can't tell you.

18:16.649 --> 18:19.737
It's a secret I have with
the horny man out back.

18:19.738 --> 18:21.448
Hatchet.

18:21.449 --> 18:24.287
Mm.

18:34.434 --> 18:36.353
Looks like the shoe
is in the other neck.

18:36.354 --> 18:37.773
I knew it.

18:37.774 --> 18:39.359
Your time machine
has a battery.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.696
It's missing.

18:40.697 --> 18:42.157
You're gonna
tell me where it is.

18:42.158 --> 18:44.035
- No.
- I'm a warrior.

18:44.036 --> 18:46.750
- I don't do the science stuff.
- Don't sell yourself short.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.712
I think you got a very good
skill set.

18:51.134 --> 18:53.764
The subtle art of deception
isn't one of them.

18:57.188 --> 18:59.065
What're you gonna do
with my glow worm blood?

18:59.066 --> 19:01.529
Just fondly remember
my pet glow worm?

19:01.530 --> 19:03.073
Blood you keep in a vial
that fits perfectly

19:03.074 --> 19:05.161
- inside your time machine?
- Hey.

19:05.162 --> 19:06.748
Times were tough
where I came from.

19:06.749 --> 19:09.754
- There was only one vial size.
- Right.

19:09.755 --> 19:12.383
I'll see you around, Tiger.

19:16.727 --> 19:19.314
What's gonna happen when I put
this in the time machine, hmm?

19:19.315 --> 19:21.235
Oh, nothing.

19:21.236 --> 19:23.072
- You know, if you do it right.
- Nice try.

19:23.073 --> 19:25.284
But we've used
the machine before.

19:25.285 --> 19:27.957
There's an initiation
sequence to reactivate the fuel

19:27.958 --> 19:30.294
once it's been removed.
You get that wrong,

19:30.295 --> 19:33.259
the only place you're time
traveling to is hell.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.556
- Hmm.
- You're lying.

19:35.557 --> 19:37.935
Now there's no
outsmarting you, Jer Bear.

19:37.936 --> 19:39.730
Reverse psychology
won't work.

19:39.731 --> 19:40.816
You've already
told me everything.

19:40.817 --> 19:42.443
Yeah, yeah, you nailed it.

19:42.444 --> 19:44.281
Reverse-reverse psychology
won't work either.

19:44.282 --> 19:47.621
- Isn't that just psychology?
- I don't know.

19:47.622 --> 19:50.126
I'm not a psychologist.

19:50.127 --> 19:53.508
My PhD is in rolling the dice.

19:57.809 --> 20:00.271
Yahtzee.

20:00.272 --> 20:03.319
Mm.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.506
- Oh.
- Ow.

20:28.746 --> 20:30.666
Chimes up, Jer Bear.

20:37.514 --> 20:38.640
Don't do it.

20:38.641 --> 20:40.978
A plutonium-based power source

20:40.979 --> 20:43.232
has a fraction
of the joules necessary

20:43.233 --> 20:44.902
to generate a field stable
enough to breach

20:44.903 --> 20:48.200
- the inter-dimensional plane.
- No science stuff, huh?

20:48.201 --> 20:50.371
I guess we're both liars.

20:50.372 --> 20:53.168
That's the first
true thing you've said.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.839
I'll take my chances.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.427
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, okay.

20:57.428 --> 20:59.765
We can both walk away from this
with something we want.

20:59.766 --> 21:01.978
You with your head attached.

21:01.979 --> 21:04.399
Me with my TTD.

21:06.655 --> 21:10.327
If you say it won't work,
that means it's going to.

21:10.328 --> 21:11.581
What if you're wrong?

21:11.582 --> 21:13.250
Then I'll die

21:13.251 --> 21:15.589
knowing I took away
the one thing you want most.

21:19.723 --> 21:21.727
No!

21:51.620 --> 21:53.623
How?

21:55.377 --> 21:58.090
- Lord Torque.
- Lord Torque, come quick.

21:59.426 --> 22:01.471
Burn the stray.

22:01.472 --> 22:04.352
Burn the stray.
Burn the stray.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.987
Ah.

22:08.988 --> 22:10.406
Damn.

22:10.407 --> 22:12.160
Not a good move.

22:12.161 --> 22:13.955
You mess with the cluster,
you're gonna find yourself

22:13.956 --> 22:15.542
on the business end
of a bonfire.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.838
Do you even
hear yourself right now?

22:17.839 --> 22:20.217
Those people just
tried to burn me alive.

22:20.218 --> 22:22.598
Well, you shouldn't have
brought Lugnut into this.

22:22.599 --> 22:23.933
I told you
I was gonna look into

22:23.934 --> 22:25.562
your Pointed Circle
allegations,

22:25.563 --> 22:27.231
and I have never
broken a promise

22:27.232 --> 22:28.902
in my political career.

22:28.903 --> 22:30.446
- Political career?
- Mm-hmm.

22:30.447 --> 22:32.659
All you did was
let an old man die

22:32.660 --> 22:34.663
and then you stole his jacket.
That's it.

22:34.664 --> 22:36.166
And how are you making
this haircut work? What--

22:36.167 --> 22:38.420
Hey, a little gratitude,
okay?

22:38.421 --> 22:40.132
You were about to be burned
alive back there.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.426
You promised me that
if I came to your time,

22:41.427 --> 22:43.180
you would take care of me.

22:43.181 --> 22:46.646
Well, looky here, you've
got a roof over your head,

22:46.647 --> 22:48.357
three walls around you,

22:48.358 --> 22:51.864
and mushy bean leavings
twice a day, so, you know,

22:51.865 --> 22:53.450
I'd say you're
living pretty large.

22:53.451 --> 22:56.916
Now, hold still
while I put this muzzle on.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.544
No, no, no, no, no, no,
you're--

22:58.545 --> 23:00.297
- Yeah, come here.
- Look, you can't muzzle me.

23:00.298 --> 23:01.550
You're not gonna muzzle J1.
You can't.

23:01.551 --> 23:02.970
- Yes, I can.
- I will.

23:02.971 --> 23:05.934
Shh, shh.

23:05.935 --> 23:07.938
I just did.

23:09.526 --> 23:12.071
You know,
you brought this on yourself.

23:12.072 --> 23:13.908
Shh.

23:13.909 --> 23:16.371
Psst-shh.
No.

23:19.003 --> 23:21.464
If it's not one thing,
it's something else.

23:21.465 --> 23:24.387
Oh, boobs, yeah, of course.

23:24.388 --> 23:27.811
No, no.

23:27.812 --> 23:30.107
You need to stay.

23:30.108 --> 23:33.990
Stay.
Stay.

23:33.991 --> 23:36.829
Good boy.

23:53.488 --> 23:56.409
That's, um, wow.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.831
Yeah, it's awesome, right?

23:58.832 --> 24:00.459
- Where's Josh?
- He's tied up.

24:00.460 --> 24:02.296
All right,
well, we need to get him

24:02.297 --> 24:04.510
'cause Jeri blew up again,
and she took the TTD with her.

24:04.511 --> 24:07.056
- Her again?
- Head explode?

24:07.057 --> 24:09.728
- No, head intact.
- Actually, the rest of her is,

24:09.729 --> 24:12.108
- you know, that's not so much.
- Whoa.

24:12.109 --> 24:13.986
We're officially
trapped in this time,

24:13.987 --> 24:15.990
so if we wanna survive, we need
to be

24:15.991 --> 24:17.828
on a spaceship to Mars
in two days.

24:17.829 --> 24:19.790
A space wagon
to a sky sparkle?

24:21.001 --> 24:23.631
All right, take this.

24:23.632 --> 24:25.259
- It's a key to Stu's compound.
- Ugh.

24:25.260 --> 24:27.304
Just--it'll get you
through no matter what.

24:27.305 --> 24:29.225
Wolf, this is serious.

24:29.226 --> 24:31.020
- Torque.
- Your name is Wolf.

24:31.021 --> 24:33.275
No, my name was Wolf.

24:33.276 --> 24:36.532
Then it was Corey Wolf-Hart.
Then briefly Wolf again.

24:36.533 --> 24:38.118
And now Torque.

24:38.119 --> 24:40.582
Or if we're being formal,
you can address me as

24:40.583 --> 24:42.836
"His Eminence, the Supreme
Overlord Wheelmaker,

24:42.837 --> 24:44.130
"First of His Name."

24:44.131 --> 24:46.802
- Okay, Supreme Overlord.
- Yes?

24:46.803 --> 24:48.598
The planet's about
to be uninhabitable.

24:48.599 --> 24:50.977
Don't try and peddle your
climate change lies

24:50.978 --> 24:53.315
on me, okay?
Everyone knows scientists

24:53.316 --> 24:57.323
just made that stuff up because
the--the...

24:57.324 --> 24:58.951
I have no idea
why they made that up,

24:58.952 --> 25:01.874
but they have a reason
and I hate them for it.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.505
M'kay, so you've
become an idiot.

25:04.506 --> 25:07.384
Look, you wanted
to find the TTD, okay?

25:07.385 --> 25:09.222
You found it.
It's destroyed.

25:09.223 --> 25:12.979
That sucks.
But look around you.

25:12.980 --> 25:16.027
This can be our new home.

25:16.028 --> 25:18.824
Come back with me to the NAG.

25:18.825 --> 25:22.331
- Yeah, I can't go to the NAG.
- Why not?

25:22.332 --> 25:26.214
Why?
Why do you keep fighting this?

25:44.126 --> 25:46.045
Help.

25:47.842 --> 25:50.220
Bio-Techs are not
the same as Biotics.

25:50.221 --> 25:51.599
Big difference.

25:54.229 --> 25:57.484
Holy shit.

25:57.485 --> 25:58.989
You're one of them.

26:02.495 --> 26:04.457
I'm--I'm still me.

26:04.458 --> 26:07.171
You're a Biotic.

26:07.172 --> 26:09.133
You...

26:09.134 --> 26:10.845
After everything
we've been through.

26:13.852 --> 26:15.772
Why didn't you tell me?

26:15.773 --> 26:18.485
'Cause it wasn't
supposed to matter.

26:18.486 --> 26:21.074
We were supposed to come back
to a time where this...

26:21.075 --> 26:22.493
this didn't matter.

26:22.494 --> 26:24.706
But we come
from a time when it does.

26:28.422 --> 26:33.139
I guess I just couldn't take
you looking at me the...

26:33.140 --> 26:35.310
the way you're
looking at me right now.

26:35.311 --> 26:37.147
You're a liar.

26:39.696 --> 26:41.657
I'm a liar?

26:41.658 --> 26:44.830
Torque, your whole life
is built on a lie.

26:44.831 --> 26:46.416
You lie every day

26:46.417 --> 26:49.213
to another man's family
and an orphan child.

26:49.214 --> 26:51.217
Don't you dare bring
my daughter into this.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.929
She's not your daughter.

26:52.930 --> 26:56.394
And no matter how much you
smile or charm them,

26:56.395 --> 27:00.444
you know deep down that their
love is for someone else.

27:00.445 --> 27:02.156
Hmm.

27:02.157 --> 27:04.828
Well,

27:04.829 --> 27:06.623
at least I have someone else.

27:11.509 --> 27:14.514
Who do you have?
