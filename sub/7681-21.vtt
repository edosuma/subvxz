01:19.738 --> 01:22.031
Most people come to
southern California for the sunshine.

01:22.032 --> 01:26.618
But there are others who burn easily,
so they stay in the shadows.

01:26.619 --> 01:29.580
Anthony Braddock was one of them.

01:29.581 --> 01:32.750
Tony Braddock
was a professional chemist.

01:32.751 --> 01:35.919
He'd worked himself out of a career
with British intelligence

01:35.920 --> 01:40.470
and into building bombs
for anyone who'd pay him.

01:42.177 --> 01:45.804
Maybe he wasn't the kind of guy
you'd want your kids to grow up to be,

01:45.805 --> 01:49.266
but one of his bombs
got me out of prison in Morocco.

01:49.267 --> 01:52.102
So when he called early
on a quiet Sunday afternoon

01:52.103 --> 01:57.493
and said he was in trouble,
I had to make good on my IOU.

01:58.568 --> 02:01.068
MacGyver?

02:01.738 --> 02:04.238
Tony?

02:04.365 --> 02:06.865
Where are you?

02:23.050 --> 02:25.550
Right here.

02:29.557 --> 02:32.225
I'm sorry for the fright, old man.

02:32.226 --> 02:34.978
Had to make sure you were alone.

02:34.979 --> 02:36.980
Yeah, I'm alone.

02:36.981 --> 02:40.191
Pete Thornton wanted to come.
It wasn't easy keeping him away.

02:40.192 --> 02:43.070
Peter, yes.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.406
He always disapproved of me.

02:46.407 --> 02:49.717
- A keen judge of character.
- Yeah.

03:12.808 --> 03:16.936
According to the organization,
Braddock should be in this area.

03:16.937 --> 03:19.772
Jules, check the warehouses here.

03:19.773 --> 03:22.442
- And when I find him?
- You'II come and get me.

03:22.443 --> 03:24.943
Braddock is mine.

03:25.446 --> 03:27.946
Tara.

03:45.632 --> 03:47.925
It's been a Iong time.

03:47.926 --> 03:50.426
Guess you haven't changed.

03:51.513 --> 03:53.306
How Iong you been
on the run, Tony?

03:53.307 --> 03:59.207
Two weeks. From the West Coast
to the East Coast and back again.

04:00.564 --> 04:03.150
I appreciate your coming.

04:03.608 --> 04:06.108
I remember Morocco.

04:06.319 --> 04:08.696
You saved my Iife.

04:08.697 --> 04:13.159
Yes, a Iot of people
would have conveniently forgotten.

04:13.160 --> 04:17.663
Have you ever heard of a man
with the code name Lancer?

04:17.664 --> 04:19.707
No.

04:19.708 --> 04:22.000
I wish I could say the same.

04:22.002 --> 04:25.088
He hired me to do a job.

04:25.255 --> 04:27.875
Naturally I assumed it was...

04:28.008 --> 04:30.676
...Iegitimate scientific research.

04:30.677 --> 04:32.177
Naturally.

04:32.178 --> 04:35.097
Yeah, I seem to have run out.
You wouldn't happen to...?

04:35.098 --> 04:37.598
No, of course not.

04:47.235 --> 04:50.028
I found him.
But there's another guy with him.

04:50.029 --> 04:52.030
He could be Braddock's contact.

04:52.031 --> 04:56.761
If he is, it'II be the Iast contact
he ever makes.

05:06.254 --> 05:08.755
You were talking
about a Iegitimate job.

05:08.756 --> 05:12.384
At Lancer's behest
and for a Iarge sum of money,

05:12.385 --> 05:16.888
I developed an explosive with a
remarkable stable molecular structure.

05:16.889 --> 05:20.475
You can mould it Iike plastic
and weave it Iike cloth.

05:20.476 --> 05:22.227
It's quite deadly.

05:22.228 --> 05:25.814
It's my crowning achievement,
you might say.

05:25.815 --> 05:28.441
What would Lancer want with it?

05:28.442 --> 05:31.069
He's going to assassinate
some of the highest-ranking officers

05:31.070 --> 05:35.031
in your country's elite
anti-terrorist brigade.

05:35.032 --> 05:37.075
Omega Force?

05:37.076 --> 05:39.576
None other.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.580
One explosion.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.291
Quite effective.

05:46.752 --> 05:50.902
The means of which
I'm afraid I've provided.

05:55.928 --> 05:58.346
Well, what's gonna happen, Tony?

05:58.347 --> 06:00.891
When? Where? How?

06:01.183 --> 06:03.853
There's gonna be a funeral...

06:03.978 --> 06:07.605
...an intelligence Iiaison
with the Omega Force, a civilian.

06:07.606 --> 06:10.567
Several of the key officers
will be there to pay their respects.

06:10.568 --> 06:12.569
How will the bomb be disguised?

06:12.570 --> 06:17.657
Well, it could be anything from a pair
of crutches to the American flag.

06:17.658 --> 06:22.787
He'II place it at the gravesite,
Ieave and then set it off.

06:22.788 --> 06:24.455
When is this gonna happen, Tony?

06:24.456 --> 06:27.668
Tomorrow, 4:00.
Westside Cemetery.

06:27.835 --> 06:30.378
AII right, I'II call Pete,
tell him to notify the authorities.

06:30.379 --> 06:32.505
Tell the brass to stay away
from the funeral.

06:32.506 --> 06:34.632
And get you some protection.

06:34.633 --> 06:39.179
MacGyver, whither thou goest,
I go too.

06:40.681 --> 06:43.181
MacGyver!

06:53.652 --> 06:56.152
He's dead.

06:59.783 --> 07:01.325
What about that other guy,
MacGyver?

07:01.326 --> 07:02.910
We don't know
what Braddock told him.

07:02.911 --> 07:04.495
Killing him shouldn't be difficult.

07:04.496 --> 07:06.664
Yeah? I've heard that song before.

07:06.665 --> 07:10.785
Well, if he had a gun,
he would've used it.

07:28.353 --> 07:30.853
No gun, huh?

07:44.077 --> 07:47.913
Muriatic acid is used
to clean algae off ship hulls.

07:47.914 --> 07:52.377
Add ammonia and it reacts
kind of interestingly.

07:52.544 --> 07:56.404
And of course
we won't mention the smell.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.908
You gotta be careful
when you handle chemicals.

08:24.909 --> 08:28.109
Each of these can be fairly deadly.

08:28.538 --> 08:31.748
But if you mix them together,
they neutralize each other,

08:31.749 --> 08:35.253
and you get instant chemical fog.

09:50.827 --> 09:53.327
The window!

09:57.751 --> 09:59.502
Look.

09:59.503 --> 10:02.223
Forget it. He's out of range.

10:02.923 --> 10:04.507
The trawler's name is Damian.

10:04.508 --> 10:06.342
- Yeah, I can read.
- Yeah.

10:06.343 --> 10:08.678
We gotta trace the registration
and find the home port.

10:08.679 --> 10:11.431
BIood. Looks Iike you hit him.

10:11.598 --> 10:16.118
It's not good enough.
Gotta make sure he's dead.

10:20.982 --> 10:22.775
This is the trawler Damian.

10:22.776 --> 10:29.241
Yankee-Bravo-Delta 4792,
calling the San Pedro marine operator.

10:29.407 --> 10:31.867
San Pedro marine operator,
go ahead.

10:31.868 --> 10:35.371
Yeah, I'd Iike to place a call
to my home in Bristol Harbour.

10:35.372 --> 10:37.790
Damian, your transmission
is breaking up.

10:37.791 --> 10:40.601
Please repeat your transmission.

10:41.544 --> 10:43.379
Can you hear me now?

10:43.380 --> 10:47.966
Your transmission is still breaking up.
Please repeat. Go ahead, Damian.

10:47.967 --> 10:53.098
This is the trawler Damian.
Yankee-Bravo-Delta 4792.

10:53.264 --> 10:55.764
Can you hear me now?

11:04.108 --> 11:06.318
Okay, Helen, you called
the Iocal hospitals

11:06.319 --> 11:08.403
and the police and got nothing.

11:08.404 --> 11:10.322
So call MacGyver's place again.

11:10.323 --> 11:12.574
I Ieft another message
five minutes ago.

11:12.575 --> 11:15.695
His machine's running out of tape.

11:15.703 --> 11:18.413
I told him not to go
on this meet alone.

11:18.414 --> 11:22.042
I also told him to call me by 5:00,
and it's past midnight now.

11:22.043 --> 11:24.127
I know.

11:24.128 --> 11:25.962
Get me the police.

11:25.963 --> 11:30.133
They don't Iabel a person missing
till he's been gone for 24 hours.

11:30.134 --> 11:32.010
Well, I can still call them, can't I?

11:32.011 --> 11:36.131
I mean, that is what they're for,
isn't it?

11:37.517 --> 11:40.352
Look, I'm sorry, Helen.
It's getting a Iittle Iate.

11:40.353 --> 11:41.770
Why don't you just go on home.

11:41.771 --> 11:44.273
I will if you will.

11:45.107 --> 11:47.944
Okay, you're the boss.

11:48.194 --> 11:51.237
I'm glad somebody around here
knows that.

11:51.238 --> 11:54.488
I don't wanna Ieave you here alone.

11:54.909 --> 11:56.701
I'm a big boy.

11:56.702 --> 11:58.787
So is MacGyver.

11:58.788 --> 12:01.290
Call me if you need me.

12:22.311 --> 12:24.145
PIease help me.

12:24.146 --> 12:27.976
Who are you?
How did you get on my boat?

12:28.150 --> 12:30.650
Come on, answer me.

12:31.528 --> 12:33.613
- I don't know.
- Just stay right where you are.

12:33.614 --> 12:38.424
- I won't hurt you.
- Yeah, I'II make sure of that.

12:55.511 --> 12:57.929
This is the trawler Damian.

12:57.930 --> 13:01.058
Yankee-Bravo-Delta 4792,

13:01.600 --> 13:08.023
calling any Coast Guard unit between
San Pedro and Bristol Harbour.

13:10.108 --> 13:12.698
Coast Guard, do you read me?

13:13.779 --> 13:16.369
Coast Guard, do you read me?

13:20.410 --> 13:24.060
Looks Iike we're stuck
with each other.

13:41.848 --> 13:45.128
Tara, try to access that file again.

13:52.942 --> 13:55.486
There has to be some way
to access that file.

13:55.487 --> 13:58.072
If there is, I don't know it.

13:58.073 --> 14:01.366
The Damian has to be registered with
the Department of Fish and Game.

14:01.367 --> 14:02.576
But it's Sunday night.

14:02.577 --> 14:04.578
AII their computer networks
are shut down.

14:04.579 --> 14:06.455
- Tomorrow morning--
- Tomorrow's too Iate.

14:06.456 --> 14:08.956
The funeral is at 4:00.

14:08.958 --> 14:14.698
If MacGyver's still alive,
he could tip off the world by then.

14:26.476 --> 14:29.311
I'm not in the habit
of picking up hitchhikers.

14:29.312 --> 14:31.271
If we hadn't been in the middle
of the ocean,

14:31.272 --> 14:34.342
I would have tossed you overboard.

14:34.776 --> 14:37.068
Yeah, I'm glad you didn't.

14:37.069 --> 14:40.449
I don't think I could swim that far.

14:41.532 --> 14:45.660
My coffee tastes Iike diesel fuel,
but you want a cup?

14:45.661 --> 14:48.161
PIease.

14:57.089 --> 15:01.260
Now, how'd you get on my boat?

15:03.804 --> 15:06.304
I don't really know.

15:09.643 --> 15:12.183
The Iast thing I remember...

15:12.605 --> 15:13.938
...was I was shot.

15:13.939 --> 15:16.439
Shot?

15:17.693 --> 15:19.319
Look, I'm gonna take you to a doctor,

15:19.320 --> 15:21.029
and then you're gonna talk
to the police,

15:21.030 --> 15:23.910
and then you and I are through.

15:24.491 --> 15:28.494
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to cause you trouble.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.995
You'II be okay.

15:33.834 --> 15:38.838
We can get something to eat
at Phil's Diner once we get in.

15:38.839 --> 15:41.090
This is all I have.

15:41.091 --> 15:45.178
Oh, don't worry about it.
Phil Iets me run a tab.

15:45.179 --> 15:47.679
I'm Carol Varnay.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.685
I just introduced myself.

15:52.686 --> 15:55.806
It's customary to respond in kind.

15:59.818 --> 16:02.318
What's your name?

16:03.780 --> 16:06.280
I don't know.

16:07.242 --> 16:09.742
You don't know your name?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.871
I can't remember.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.388
Hey, not bad.

16:29.389 --> 16:33.185
Thanks. So where are we?

16:33.351 --> 16:35.227
Beautiful Bristol Harbour.

16:35.228 --> 16:38.058
Lots of fishing boats, no fish.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.566
I don't know
if I've ever been here before.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.067
How's your head?

16:45.447 --> 16:48.574
The outside's sore.
The inside's a Iittle empty.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.160
I'm sure glad you came along
when you did.

16:51.161 --> 16:52.411
Thank you.

16:52.412 --> 16:56.562
You're the first thing I've Ianded
in weeks.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.117
What's the matter?

17:36.164 --> 17:38.664
I don't know.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.836
Just remembering something.

17:42.837 --> 17:45.172
Look, Iet me take you
to Dr. Jennings.

17:45.173 --> 17:47.132
He can take a Iook at your head.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.633
No, I'd rather not.

17:49.719 --> 17:55.619
The doctor's gonna ask questions.
I don't have any answers. Yet.

17:56.142 --> 17:59.022
I just need some time to think.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.899
So you will inform us
when you can release information

18:04.900 --> 18:06.818
on the man
who went into the water?

18:06.819 --> 18:10.656
- Yeah. We'II Iet you know.
- Okay.

18:11.365 --> 18:14.285
- Benson, the Times.
- Yeah.

18:14.452 --> 18:16.244
What do you got, Iieutenant?

18:16.245 --> 18:19.330
One murder victim in the warehouse
back there.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.207
Took a 9 mm right in the pump.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.709
Any suspects?

18:22.710 --> 18:26.546
- Investigation's in progress.
- No suspects?

18:26.547 --> 18:29.550
- No.
- Good Iuck to you.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.217
Yeah.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.527
Pete Thornton, Phoenix Foundation.
What have you got?

18:49.528 --> 18:51.571
Oh, yeah. We found some papers
from the Foundation

18:51.572 --> 18:54.115
- in that Jeep over there--
- Never mind the papers now.

18:54.116 --> 18:55.700
What about MacGyver?
Did you find him?

18:55.701 --> 18:57.743
Well, we found this jacket
with this ID in it.

18:57.744 --> 19:00.037
- It was floating in the harbour.
- That Iooks Iike blood.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.373
We're gonna run a Iab test.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.375
What's the coroner's wagon
doing here?

19:04.376 --> 19:08.421
It's a guy named Braddock.
He bought it with a 9 mm. He's dead.

19:08.422 --> 19:10.047
Anything else?

19:10.048 --> 19:12.258
We're gonna start
dragging the harbour.

19:12.259 --> 19:14.802
AII right. Let me know
if you find anything new, will you?

19:14.803 --> 19:16.178
Of course.

19:16.179 --> 19:18.679
Give us a hand over here.

19:18.682 --> 19:21.892
Excuse me, Mr. Thornton.
Benson from the Times.

19:21.893 --> 19:25.062
Didn't you use to do
intelligence work for the DXS?

19:25.063 --> 19:26.731
I've done a Iot of things.
What about it?

19:26.732 --> 19:29.400
This man MacGyver. Was he
on some sort of intelligence operation?

19:29.401 --> 19:31.694
No, he was here to see a friend
about a personal matter.

19:31.695 --> 19:33.237
Did he call you after his meeting?

19:33.238 --> 19:35.030
I haven't talked to him
since yesterday.

19:35.031 --> 19:38.576
Well, is there any reason
anyone would wanna kill him?

19:38.577 --> 19:40.661
Well, we don't know that he's dead,
do we?

19:40.662 --> 19:44.331
I mean, we haven't found a body,
have we?

19:44.332 --> 19:45.708
That's all I have to say.

19:45.709 --> 19:48.586
Well, I'm sorry to intrude,
Mr. Thornton.

19:48.587 --> 19:51.087
I won't bother you again.

19:51.631 --> 19:55.009
This MacGyver has some connection
with Peter Thornton.

19:55.010 --> 19:57.928
Thornton used to be
a DXS operative.

19:57.929 --> 20:00.264
Has MacGyver contacted him yet?

20:00.265 --> 20:03.058
No, but they haven't found
his body either.

20:03.059 --> 20:06.979
If he's alive,
he may still try to reach Thornton.

20:06.980 --> 20:10.691
Registration on the Damian.
Home port is Bristol Harbour.

20:10.692 --> 20:13.610
Owned by a woman
named Carol Varnay.

20:13.611 --> 20:18.949
Jules, get a car. Go up there,
see what you can find out.

20:18.950 --> 20:23.537
We'II meet you
at the old Bristol Harbour Cannery.

20:23.538 --> 20:25.956
Well, you sure know
your way around boats.

20:25.957 --> 20:27.374
Why do you say that?

20:27.375 --> 20:29.209
Way you handle those moorings.

20:29.210 --> 20:30.961
It takes practice.

20:30.962 --> 20:32.546
Figure you either own your own boat

20:32.547 --> 20:36.174
or maybe you worked
as a deck hand on someone else's.

20:36.175 --> 20:38.886
I don't know. Maybe I have.

21:19.552 --> 21:22.052
What is it?

21:22.930 --> 21:25.014
I don't know.

21:25.015 --> 21:31.005
Everything I'm remembering is
filled with explosions and gunfights,

21:31.147 --> 21:33.731
and I'm right
in the middle of them.

21:33.732 --> 21:36.232
I don't know why.

21:37.152 --> 21:39.112
Jason, what happened to your bike?

21:39.113 --> 21:43.293
I promise I was careful.
It just broke again.

21:43.409 --> 21:48.121
This is my nephew Jason.
Jason, this is a friend of mine.

21:48.122 --> 21:50.708
- Hi.
- Hi, Jason.

21:50.916 --> 21:53.416
Listen...

21:53.419 --> 21:55.920
...would you be willing
to sacrifice this nameplate

21:55.921 --> 21:57.380
if it would get you going again?

21:57.381 --> 21:59.881
Sure. I guess so.

22:04.221 --> 22:05.930
This happen a Iot?

22:05.931 --> 22:08.432
Yeah, I think this bike is jinxed.

22:08.433 --> 22:11.310
It's Iike it always breaks
at the wrong time.

22:11.311 --> 22:14.011
Things Iike this usually will.

22:14.565 --> 22:16.357
Mine used to come apart every time

22:16.358 --> 22:20.088
I had something
real important to go to.

22:20.237 --> 22:21.779
Where were you headed?

22:21.780 --> 22:25.074
I was on my way to a Little League
game and the chain came off.

22:25.075 --> 22:28.911
I didn't get there until the fifth inning.
We Iost.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.162
See, the problem here

22:30.163 --> 22:32.748
is the sprocket teeth
are all worn down.

22:32.749 --> 22:37.461
What we're gonna do
is make a Iittle guide for the chain.

22:37.462 --> 22:39.962
Ought to keep it on track.

22:40.674 --> 22:43.217
And next time
you'II get to the game early.

22:43.218 --> 22:45.718
Maybe come up with a win.

22:47.514 --> 22:50.024
There. That ought to do it.

22:51.726 --> 22:54.226
Just Iike that.

22:55.605 --> 22:59.276
You fixed it! Thanks!

23:03.655 --> 23:05.406
That was pretty good.

23:05.407 --> 23:07.997
The way you fixed that bike.

23:08.618 --> 23:10.536
Thanks.

23:10.537 --> 23:13.867
Come on. Let's get something to eat.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.543
We should be there
in another 20 minutes.

23:17.544 --> 23:19.086
We're making good time.

23:19.087 --> 23:21.630
How Iong do you think
it took that boat to get there?

23:21.631 --> 23:25.008
Bristol Harbour's 52 miles
up the coast.

23:25.009 --> 23:27.135
The Damian should have
made it back to home port

23:27.136 --> 23:28.637
early this morning.

23:28.638 --> 23:33.684
As of two hours ago, Thornton
hadn't heard from MacGyver.

23:33.685 --> 23:35.811
There are two possibilities:

23:35.812 --> 23:38.313
Either he's alive or he's dead.

23:38.314 --> 23:40.232
If he's dead, they'II bury him.

23:40.233 --> 23:42.859
If not, we'II find him and kill him.

23:42.860 --> 23:44.236
It's that simple.

23:44.237 --> 23:46.405
It's not simple at all.

23:46.406 --> 23:49.074
If MacGyver's passed on
his information,

23:49.075 --> 23:51.868
this whole thing could blow up
in our faces.

23:51.869 --> 23:55.497
Speaking of which, when are we going
to pick up the explosive?

23:55.498 --> 23:58.218
Oh, it's been here all along.

23:58.376 --> 24:01.879
Woven right into the Iining.

24:02.046 --> 24:05.675
AII I have to do is set the timer.

24:06.676 --> 24:08.718
So how Iong have you Iived here?

24:08.719 --> 24:10.345
AII my Iife.

24:10.346 --> 24:13.139
I grew up here
with my dad and brother.

24:13.140 --> 24:14.683
A Iot of memories.

24:14.684 --> 24:16.977
We were pretty inseparable.

24:16.978 --> 24:18.895
"Were"?

24:18.896 --> 24:20.730
Yeah, you know that storm
two years ago?

24:20.731 --> 24:23.859
EIeanor? Took them overboard.

24:24.026 --> 24:26.526
Never found them.

24:27.196 --> 24:28.863
I'm sorry.

24:28.864 --> 24:32.864
The Varnays are fishermen.
AIways have been.

24:33.410 --> 24:36.162
So now I've got the Damian and...

24:36.163 --> 24:39.123
I know I should sell her, but...

24:39.834 --> 24:41.835
You know what
I really want to get into?

24:41.836 --> 24:43.419
What?

24:43.420 --> 24:46.257
Marine science. Research.

24:47.007 --> 24:50.627
- Why don't you?
- It's not that easy.

24:50.719 --> 24:53.972
There's something
about that boat and this place.

24:53.973 --> 24:56.473
It's got a hold on me.

24:57.893 --> 25:02.271
It sounds Iike you're trapped
by things you remember.

25:02.272 --> 25:05.122
I'm trapped by things I can't.

25:12.574 --> 25:15.074
Phoenix.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.833
Phoenix.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.334
Arizona?

25:25.796 --> 25:27.838
No.

25:27.839 --> 25:30.339
No.

25:33.095 --> 25:36.597
Something's coming back,
but I can't get a handle on it.

25:36.598 --> 25:37.932
Has it got something to do

25:37.933 --> 25:41.769
with the mythology of the bird
rising out of the ashes?

25:41.770 --> 25:43.813
No. No.

25:43.814 --> 25:45.940
Business?

25:45.941 --> 25:48.275
An address or something?

25:48.276 --> 25:50.236
Could it be a person's name?

25:50.237 --> 25:52.777
Somebody you know, a friend?

25:52.906 --> 25:56.283
Or maybe it's a symbol.
You know, Iike a sign.

25:56.284 --> 25:59.774
A sign-- A sign maybe
where you work?

26:02.582 --> 26:05.082
The Phoenix Foundation.

26:05.293 --> 26:07.793
It's in Los Angeles.

26:14.552 --> 26:16.470
Come on, what's the number?

26:16.471 --> 26:17.971
Well, call information.

26:17.972 --> 26:20.642
No, it's a special number.

26:20.809 --> 26:23.309
A private one.

26:27.315 --> 26:29.107
I called Sam Taylor in Washington

26:29.108 --> 26:31.568
and asked for an update
on Anthony Braddock,

26:31.569 --> 26:33.820
including all current connections.

26:33.821 --> 26:35.864
And what did he say?

26:35.865 --> 26:39.451
That you no Ionger have
unlimited security access.

26:39.452 --> 26:41.952
Sam said that?

26:42.538 --> 26:44.456
What is he doing,
turning bureaucrat on me?

26:44.457 --> 26:45.958
Get him on the phone right away.

26:45.959 --> 26:48.460
- Calm down.
- I wanna talk to him!

26:48.461 --> 26:51.963
I reminded him of the time
you covered his tail in Marseilles.

26:51.964 --> 26:55.084
And that I still had the pictures.

26:59.097 --> 27:01.098
You kept those shots?

27:01.099 --> 27:04.185
No, but he doesn't know that.

27:04.352 --> 27:09.105
So Anthony Braddock is tied to
someone with the code name Lancer.

27:09.106 --> 27:12.126
Nationality unknown. No home base.

27:13.945 --> 27:16.404
Well, what does this...

27:16.405 --> 27:17.948
...Lancer do?

27:17.949 --> 27:20.951
He kills people. AII over the world.

27:20.952 --> 27:23.536
Strictly cash on the gravestone.

27:23.537 --> 27:26.748
Sam says they think Lancer
is planning a hit.

27:26.749 --> 27:29.249
Could be anytime now.

27:29.251 --> 27:31.751
Could be MacGyver.

27:35.091 --> 27:36.633
That's gotta be the police.

27:36.634 --> 27:38.676
I gave them the private Iine.

27:38.677 --> 27:39.928
Yes?

27:39.929 --> 27:43.306
Hello. Is this
the Phoenix Foundation?

27:43.307 --> 27:45.558
MacGyver! Where are you?

27:45.559 --> 27:47.060
MacGyver, is that you?

27:47.061 --> 27:48.603
MacGyver.

27:48.604 --> 27:52.398
Come on, answer!
Helen, get on the other line.

27:52.399 --> 27:56.235
- Do you know him?
- Oh, he's my ace buddy.

27:56.236 --> 27:58.237
He's Iost his memory.

27:58.238 --> 28:00.365
Well, if he'II come along with me,

28:00.366 --> 28:04.327
I'II try and help him find it.
Right this way.

28:04.328 --> 28:06.828
Don't talk, just move.

28:08.165 --> 28:10.665
Talk to me!

28:11.376 --> 28:13.876
Talk to me!

28:16.799 --> 28:19.299
So who are you?

28:19.510 --> 28:23.480
- What do you want with me?
- No questions.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.330
Come on, Iet's get out of here.

28:38.820 --> 28:42.698
MacGyver, this is Pete.
You gotta answer me. Please!

28:42.699 --> 28:47.496
You gotta answer me. MacGyver!

28:53.043 --> 28:55.795
Carol, could that guy
have been the police?

28:55.796 --> 28:58.797
No, if he was the police,
he would've said so.

28:58.798 --> 29:01.050
Besides, what do the police
want with you?

29:01.051 --> 29:05.054
I don't know. But things
are starting to come back to me.

29:05.055 --> 29:08.474
That Phoenix Foundation,
that was real.

29:08.475 --> 29:10.142
I gotta have time to think.

29:10.143 --> 29:13.562
- Well, do it at my place. Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.

29:13.563 --> 29:15.189
Look.

29:15.190 --> 29:17.232
I don't want to get you in trouble.

29:17.233 --> 29:22.623
If I want your advice, pal, I'II ask for it.
Now come on.

29:23.406 --> 29:26.033
MacGyver was on the telephone
when I got there.

29:26.034 --> 29:28.702
Said something about
Phoenix Foundation.

29:28.703 --> 29:31.663
Peter Thornton.
What did MacGyver tell him?

29:31.664 --> 29:33.415
I didn't give him a chance
to say anything.

29:33.416 --> 29:35.792
- That's when I pulled my gun.
- That's why you're an idiot.

29:35.793 --> 29:37.336
Don't call me that.

29:37.337 --> 29:39.505
I'm the one that found Braddock
in the first place.

29:39.506 --> 29:41.006
But you Iet MacGyver get away.

29:41.007 --> 29:42.841
- Look, don't you start.
- She's right.

29:42.842 --> 29:44.760
If you don't Iike the way
I'm handling things,

29:44.761 --> 29:47.137
then pay me off and I'm gone.

29:47.138 --> 29:53.435
But I've got enough on the both of you
to put you away until you rot.

29:53.436 --> 29:57.147
So I guess I'm not
such an idiot after all.

29:57.148 --> 30:00.218
Of course not, Jules. I apologize.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.195
You did what you felt you had to do.

30:03.196 --> 30:06.114
Besides, he didn't
tell Thornton anything.

30:06.115 --> 30:08.283
The girl said he Iost his memory.

30:08.284 --> 30:11.077
Carol Varnay.
Find her home address.

30:11.078 --> 30:13.578
I'II set the detonator.

30:13.873 --> 30:16.249
So...

30:16.250 --> 30:18.710
...MacGyver has amnesia.

30:18.711 --> 30:21.546
And amnesia
is not a permanent condition.

30:21.547 --> 30:24.299
It just has to Iast
until the funeral today.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.718
I don't think we can count on that.

30:26.719 --> 30:28.219
Very good, Jules.

30:28.220 --> 30:31.598
Now Thornton knows
MacGyver is still alive,

30:31.599 --> 30:34.934
and if he had the call traced,
he'II be on his way.

30:34.935 --> 30:37.395
If he gets to MacGyver
before we do--

30:37.396 --> 30:40.065
Well, we can't Iet
that happen, can we?

30:40.066 --> 30:42.984
AII right, thank you. That's great.

30:42.985 --> 30:45.236
That call from MacGyver
came from a public phone

30:45.237 --> 30:48.072
on the Bristol Harbour pier,
30 miles north of here.

30:48.073 --> 30:50.325
I'm going up there. Call Sam Taylor.

30:50.326 --> 30:53.244
I want the Iatest information
he's got on this Lancer character.

30:53.245 --> 30:56.749
- Wait! Take your coat!
- Thank you.

31:09.386 --> 31:10.636
No answer?

31:10.637 --> 31:14.599
No. And it's the same number
I called before.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.476
Someone was there.

31:16.477 --> 31:19.061
Now, the man on the phone
called you MacGyver.

31:19.062 --> 31:20.980
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

31:20.981 --> 31:23.107
No, it's just a name.

31:23.108 --> 31:24.609
Well, it's a start.

31:24.610 --> 31:28.571
Now, Iook, all we've gotta do is put
the pieces of this puzzle together.

31:28.572 --> 31:30.114
I'm great at puzzles.

31:30.115 --> 31:33.284
Carol, everything I'm remembering
is so violent.

31:33.285 --> 31:35.453
For all we know,
I could be a criminal.

31:35.454 --> 31:37.121
I don't think you are.

31:37.122 --> 31:40.583
- I could be.
- Do you feel Iike one?

31:40.584 --> 31:43.044
No.

31:43.045 --> 31:47.048
But with all these flashes of memory,
what if I am?

31:47.049 --> 31:49.549
I'II take my chances.

32:32.594 --> 32:34.678
Hi.

32:34.679 --> 32:36.221
Hi.

32:36.222 --> 32:39.183
Did you happen to see a man
using that end phone there?

32:39.184 --> 32:41.810
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

32:41.811 --> 32:43.896
He's a good friend,
a really good friend of mine,

32:43.897 --> 32:45.856
and he's in trouble.

32:45.857 --> 32:48.317
Well, what's he Iook Iike?

32:48.318 --> 32:50.319
Well, he's kind of tall,
a Iittle over six feet.

32:50.320 --> 32:54.630
He's got brown hair, Iong in back,
brown eyes.

32:54.657 --> 32:56.033
He's a nice guy.

32:56.034 --> 32:59.894
He doesn't dress Iike me.
Kind of casual.

33:06.210 --> 33:07.461
He was here.

33:07.462 --> 33:08.920
I never said.

33:08.921 --> 33:10.464
He made that!

33:10.465 --> 33:11.882
How did you know?

33:11.883 --> 33:15.635
Well, Iet's just say
I recognize the work.

33:15.636 --> 33:18.972
His name is MacGyver.
He can fix anything.

33:18.973 --> 33:22.642
He could fix a computer with a hairpin
and a piece of duct tape.

33:22.643 --> 33:24.603
Just Iike he fixed your bike.

33:24.604 --> 33:27.063
Will you help me to help him?

33:27.064 --> 33:31.694
Tara, do you have the address
of the Varnay house?

33:33.904 --> 33:37.324
MacGyver and the girl
can both make me.

33:37.325 --> 33:39.617
I want to take care of them now.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.913
Fine, Jules. The sooner the better.

33:50.921 --> 33:52.589
I thought you wanted
MacGyver alive.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.966
- I do.
- Then why did you say that?

33:54.967 --> 33:58.136
I have to assume MacGyver
told Thornton about our plan.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.430
And Thornton is setting a trap
for me at the funeral.

34:00.431 --> 34:02.265
You don't have to go through with it.

34:02.266 --> 34:04.100
I have a contract.

34:04.101 --> 34:06.269
But you have to protect yourself...

34:06.270 --> 34:08.605
...and the organization.

34:08.606 --> 34:12.984
If there is a trap,
I can use MacGyver to get Thornton.

34:12.985 --> 34:15.625
And Jules can help me do it.

34:20.951 --> 34:24.579
I keep getting so close to putting
everything together, and then...

34:24.580 --> 34:27.080
...nothing happens.

35:21.636 --> 35:27.141
It could be anything from a pair
of crutches to the American flag.

35:27.142 --> 35:29.642
- MacGyver?
- MacGyver!

35:32.188 --> 35:34.356
MacGyver?

35:34.357 --> 35:37.026
- He's dead.
- Who?

35:37.193 --> 35:38.527
I saw him get shot.

35:38.528 --> 35:41.518
What? What are you talking about?

35:42.449 --> 35:45.117
I'm really not sure.
Something about a killing.

35:45.118 --> 35:47.618
Killing? Where?

35:48.872 --> 35:51.372
At a cemetery.

35:53.334 --> 35:55.544
The Westside Cemetery.

35:55.545 --> 35:58.798
Who? Who's gonna get killed?

35:58.965 --> 36:02.426
I don't know.
But it's gonna happen today.

36:02.427 --> 36:07.087
I'm gonna try that
Phoenix Foundation number again.

36:15.148 --> 36:18.798
- Your phone is dead.
- And so are you.

36:21.195 --> 36:24.845
Carol, get out of here!
Get the police!

36:26.200 --> 36:28.700
Get up!

36:35.042 --> 36:37.542
GIad I got here in time.

36:37.753 --> 36:39.963
Are you okay?

36:39.964 --> 36:42.465
- Yeah.
- Guess the target was you.

36:42.466 --> 36:44.968
You just saved my Iife.
Who are you?

36:44.969 --> 36:48.931
MacGyver,
you really don't know who I am?

36:49.098 --> 36:50.849
I've Iost my memory.

36:50.850 --> 36:53.017
It's J.D.

36:53.018 --> 36:56.146
Jonathan Dawkins.
Military intelligence.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.273
I'm your boss.

36:58.274 --> 37:00.814
Don't you remember anything?

37:01.819 --> 37:04.696
AII I remember is that
there's gonna be a killing

37:04.697 --> 37:06.239
at the Westside Cemetery.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.783
I don't know how I know that or why.

37:08.784 --> 37:10.618
Well, that was your assignment.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.870
That's what we sent you in
to find out.

37:12.871 --> 37:14.831
Do you know when
this is taking place?

37:14.832 --> 37:16.416
Sometime today.

37:16.417 --> 37:18.543
That's the Thompkins funeral.

37:18.544 --> 37:21.004
The officers from
the Omega Force will be there.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.214
Omega Force?

37:23.215 --> 37:26.968
The cemetery's an hour away.
We still have time get there.

37:26.969 --> 37:29.303
I need you to stop the killer.

37:29.304 --> 37:30.638
Any idea who it is?

37:30.639 --> 37:34.016
Oh, we've got a suspect.
He's a professional terrorist.

37:34.017 --> 37:36.517
His name's Peter Thornton.

37:49.825 --> 37:52.076
Mobile command post
to Omega base.

37:52.077 --> 37:54.704
Omega base, this is Major Dawkins.

37:54.705 --> 37:57.498
We're on our way
to the Westside Cemetery.

37:57.499 --> 38:00.668
Set up our perimeter security,
but keep it covert.

38:00.669 --> 38:04.338
We don't want our suspect Thornton
to cut and run.

38:04.339 --> 38:06.757
I'II remain in contact.

38:06.758 --> 38:09.677
So how Iong have I been
with military intelligence?

38:09.678 --> 38:12.928
Oh, it'II be five years next month.

38:19.145 --> 38:21.146
We'II get you the best help available.

38:21.147 --> 38:24.358
But first we've gotta stop
this assassination.

38:24.359 --> 38:27.528
We've gotta know if your information
has been compromised.

38:27.529 --> 38:30.698
Peter Thornton is a member
of a terrorist group.

38:30.699 --> 38:34.076
The front is called
the Phoenix Foundation.

38:34.077 --> 38:36.577
Phoenix Foundation.

38:36.621 --> 38:39.373
Yeah, I talked to somebody there.
I'm not sure who it was.

38:39.374 --> 38:41.500
Well, that had
to have been Thornton.

38:41.501 --> 38:44.378
He's the man who engineered
the coup down in San Cortez.

38:44.379 --> 38:46.380
You've been Iooking for him
for five years.

38:46.381 --> 38:48.966
And he's been trying to kill you.

38:48.967 --> 38:53.897
MacGyver, if you remember anything,
remember this face.

39:07.735 --> 39:09.152
Half an hour.

39:09.153 --> 39:12.447
If I'd found out half an hour earlier
I might have been here in time.

39:12.448 --> 39:14.741
What do you think has happened
to MacGyver?

39:14.742 --> 39:16.326
I'm afraid Lancer has him.

39:16.327 --> 39:19.371
The only information we have on him
is that he's planning an assassination.

39:19.372 --> 39:20.580
And we don't know where.

39:20.581 --> 39:22.916
MacGyver said something
about a killing.

39:22.917 --> 39:25.627
- He what?
- It was all in bits and pieces,

39:25.628 --> 39:28.922
but he said it was
supposed to happen today

39:28.923 --> 39:31.341
at the Westside Cemetery.

39:31.342 --> 39:36.712
Oh, that's gotta be it.
Thank you. Thank you, Miss Varnay.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.700
Pull it up right here.

40:03.833 --> 40:06.584
Wait for us
on the upper service road.

40:06.585 --> 40:09.085
You okay?

40:13.467 --> 40:16.469
If anything happens,
if Thornton shows up,

40:16.470 --> 40:18.513
you know who he is
and what he's trying to do.

40:18.514 --> 40:21.014
Don't take any chances.

40:30.401 --> 40:32.485
That's right, Helen,
the Westside Cemetery.

40:32.486 --> 40:35.236
And, oh, I need police backup.

40:41.995 --> 40:46.515
What is a man that God
might take notice of him?

40:46.542 --> 40:48.501
My friends...

40:48.502 --> 40:54.967
...Joe Thompkins was the kind of man
God and all of us surely noticed.

40:55.133 --> 41:00.347
And we will miss him
more than we can measure.

41:00.555 --> 41:03.516
He was a beloved husband
and father,

41:03.517 --> 41:06.311
a dear and Ioyal friend.

41:06.478 --> 41:10.815
And though we have come together
today to mourn his passing,

41:10.816 --> 41:12.691
we rejoice in the triumph of his Iife...

41:12.692 --> 41:14.485
I'm checking perimeter security.

41:14.486 --> 41:16.904
Keep an eye out for Thornton.

41:16.905 --> 41:20.115
-- will return to our Heavenly Father
who made it,

41:20.116 --> 41:26.705
and that his soul will be forever part
of the glory of God's holy kingdom.

41:26.706 --> 41:32.045
But remember, our Lord said,
"BIessed are the peacemakers."

41:32.963 --> 41:35.923
In a world shattered
by senseless violence

41:35.924 --> 41:39.218
that so tragically often strikes
at the innocent,

41:39.219 --> 41:43.515
our friend was a peacemaker.

41:43.723 --> 41:46.223
He saw the task.

41:48.395 --> 41:50.396
He accepted it.

41:50.397 --> 41:54.108
He made of his Iife a testament
to his country,

41:54.109 --> 41:57.278
his service, his people.

41:57.445 --> 41:59.196
He defended flag and country

41:59.197 --> 42:03.197
in faraway places,
fighting for the right...

42:04.494 --> 42:06.787
MacGyver!

42:06.788 --> 42:09.999
Hold it. Stay right there.

42:10.583 --> 42:12.584
I know you've got amnesia.

42:12.585 --> 42:13.961
You don't know who I am, do you?

42:13.962 --> 42:17.612
You're Peter Thornton.
You're a killer.

42:18.091 --> 42:19.591
Put down the gun.

42:19.592 --> 42:21.009
I wouldn't.

42:21.010 --> 42:25.138
I have a picture in my wallet
of the two of us together.

42:25.139 --> 42:29.518
- I want to show it to you.
- I said, don't move.

42:29.519 --> 42:33.897
Right now I know you better
than you know yourself.

42:33.898 --> 42:36.400
You don't use guns.

42:38.194 --> 42:41.154
That gun doesn't feel right
in your hand.

42:41.155 --> 42:43.198
It can't.

42:43.199 --> 42:47.787
You don't use guns, MacGyver.
You hate them.

42:48.371 --> 42:51.247
That number you called
at the Phoenix Foundation.

42:51.248 --> 42:53.748
That was my number.

42:53.918 --> 42:58.463
You were trying to reach me,
whether you knew it or not.

42:58.464 --> 43:00.964
I saved your Iife.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.094
You were buried in an avalanche.

43:04.095 --> 43:06.346
And I dug you out.

43:06.347 --> 43:08.181
I saved you.

43:08.182 --> 43:12.227
Somewhere deep inside
you've got to know that.

43:12.228 --> 43:14.604
MacGyver, we're coming!

43:14.605 --> 43:18.515
Go easy, go easy.
We don't wanna hit him.

43:19.151 --> 43:22.271
Easy. Take it easy. Look out, now.

43:27.785 --> 43:29.994
Are you all right?

43:29.995 --> 43:32.495
Thanks, Pete.

43:48.305 --> 43:50.805
Pete.

43:52.017 --> 43:54.517
Thank God.

43:55.103 --> 43:57.355
Tony Braddock said
there's gonna be a killing.

43:57.356 --> 43:58.898
Did he tell you about Lancer?

43:58.899 --> 44:01.901
Lancer's gonna do it at the funeral.

44:01.902 --> 44:03.945
Come on.

44:03.946 --> 44:05.655
Lancer planted an explosive.

44:05.656 --> 44:06.864
- Where?
- I don't know.

44:06.865 --> 44:08.699
I'II clear the area.

44:08.700 --> 44:11.619
-- will follow me
all the days of my Iife,

44:11.620 --> 44:15.373
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

44:15.374 --> 44:17.041
AII right, everyone.

44:17.042 --> 44:20.482
- Down. Down.
- Move out of the area.

44:23.965 --> 44:25.883
You can mould it Iike plastic

44:25.884 --> 44:28.384
or weave it like cloth.

44:28.512 --> 44:31.012
Or weave it Iike cloth.

44:32.515 --> 44:35.015
Like cloth.

44:38.605 --> 44:42.195
It's the coat. The bomb's in the coat.

44:45.570 --> 44:48.070
MacGyver, is that Lancer?

44:48.365 --> 44:49.656
- Yeah.
- Is that-- ?

44:49.657 --> 44:51.033
- Yeah!
- Well, get rid of it!

44:51.034 --> 44:53.534
I am!

45:12.597 --> 45:16.475
If you knew this was happening,
why didn't you call the police?

45:16.476 --> 45:18.101
I did.

45:18.102 --> 45:20.602
Well, I'II be.

45:22.607 --> 45:25.277
Nice to meet you again, Pete.

45:32.325 --> 45:34.076
So you mean
the Phoenix Foundation

45:34.077 --> 45:36.286
pays you a bonus
after every assignment?

45:36.287 --> 45:38.789
No, well, they don't exactly pay.

45:38.790 --> 45:40.749
They kind of do things.

45:40.750 --> 45:42.417
They arranged for me
to have a scrimmage

45:42.418 --> 45:44.461
with a pro hockey team one time

45:44.462 --> 45:47.797
and arranged for a scholarship
for a Iittle girl.

45:47.798 --> 45:50.298
And...

45:51.427 --> 45:55.138
...they bought some new wheels
for a friend of mine.

45:55.139 --> 45:57.515
Is it really for me?

45:57.516 --> 46:00.393
Yeah, I'd say it's about the right size.

46:00.394 --> 46:02.894
Thanks, MacGyver.

46:03.147 --> 46:05.647
Check it out.

46:07.151 --> 46:10.820
So you are one of the good guys
after all.

46:10.821 --> 46:12.697
Told you.

46:12.698 --> 46:15.033
Oh, you did more than that.

46:15.034 --> 46:17.118
You saved my Iife.

46:17.119 --> 46:20.580
And the Iives of a Iot
of other people too. Thank you.

46:20.581 --> 46:23.917
You made me Iook at my Iife
in a whole new way.

46:23.918 --> 46:26.294
Memories are okay to have

46:26.295 --> 46:28.963
as Iong as they don't
get in the way of dreams.

46:28.964 --> 46:31.549
Am I hearing
what I think I'm hearing?

46:31.550 --> 46:35.553
Marine science. Going back to school.
Nights and weekends.

46:35.554 --> 46:39.390
It's gonna take a Iittle Ionger,
but I'II do it.

46:39.391 --> 46:41.351
And you'II be invited to graduation.

46:41.352 --> 46:43.352
Well, that's something I won't forget.

46:43.353 --> 46:46.732
MacGyver! Look! Watch this.
