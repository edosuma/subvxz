19:05.078 --> 19:07.145
Whoa. He's done it.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.279
I can't believe it, folks.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.515
A two-hander.
That's one for
the record books.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.984
Don't, don't
embarrass yourself, bruh.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.253
He's over here trying
to out-flip water.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.856
Both:
Thank you for your
generous donation.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.759
(both sighing)

19:21.761 --> 19:24.495
I think that is it
for me, Chels.
I am exhausted.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.997
Yep. Right?

19:25.999 --> 19:29.033
We fought hard, you know?
And we raised a lot of money.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.636
Yeah, but, was it enough?

19:31.638 --> 19:34.205
-Did we beat Coach Spitz?
-Oh.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.340
I don't think
we'll ever find out,
and you know what?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.709
-I'm too tired to care.
-Yeah. (clears throat)

19:38.711 --> 19:40.678
-Ladies.
-Both: Hey!

19:41.781 --> 19:44.048
-What are you here for,
to gloat?
-(chuckling)

19:44.050 --> 19:47.185
I just came to thank you
for your incredible
dedication today.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.687
You two raised $2,000.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.856
Both (screaming):
Yes! Yes! Yes!

19:51.858 --> 19:53.658
-We did that.
-Yeah, we did!

19:53.660 --> 19:55.693
-Wait a second.
How much did you raise?
-(chuckling)

19:55.695 --> 19:58.162
Oh. I raised, uh,
fifty dollars.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.730
-Both: What?
-What can I say?

19:59.732 --> 20:01.232
I don't have the gift of gab.

20:01.234 --> 20:05.236
I inflated he amounts
I was raising so you'd
compete with me.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.372
You played us?
That was low.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.475
-But a really good idea.
We should use that on the kids.
-Yeah.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.911
I'm Coach Spitz.
I know how to
motivate people.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.782
Otherwise...
Well, otherwise,
I'd just be Spitz.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.685
-Go, Mama Peanut.
-Aah, aah!

20:20.687 --> 20:22.687
It's Miami Peanuts now, Coach.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.322
-Okay.
-Yeah! Yes!

20:24.324 --> 20:25.856
-All right, Yeah, Miami!
-Yeah.

20:25.858 --> 20:29.260
(all chattering)

20:32.332 --> 20:34.098
So...

20:34.100 --> 20:36.167
Tess, did we do it?
Can we be done yet?

20:36.169 --> 20:39.370
If you're asking
if we made $5,000,

20:39.372 --> 20:41.105
the answer is no.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.040
Oh.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.576
We made $10,500.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.179
-(laughs)
-The 'Nuts are going
to Nationals!

20:48.181 --> 20:51.315
(cheering and applause)

20:54.120 --> 20:55.553
Great job, O'Malley.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.021
You were a real trouper today.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.723
Now we have enough
to go to nationals,

20:58.725 --> 21:01.092
-and help the school
repair the roof.
-Mm-hmm.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.627
I saw you hustling
out there today.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.629
Cleaning up spills.
Keeping things moving.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.297
You're a real leader, Tess.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.699
Thanks, Coach.
I doubted myself
for a minute.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.234
Well, that was
a wasted minute.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.103
Because I never doubted you.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.139
We're lucky to have you
as captain.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.775
Hey, that was my vision.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.578
Well, I am so glad
you got it wrong.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.948
Ah, you know, that,
that happens every
once in a while.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.650
Would you like
to do the honors?

21:25.652 --> 21:27.718
I would love to.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.220
Go, Peanuts!

21:29.222 --> 21:31.389
All:
Go, Peanuts!

21:31.391 --> 21:34.191
(all cheering)

21:38.298 --> 21:41.065
(groaning)

21:42.068 --> 21:43.934
Levi, let's just
get the scissors

21:43.936 --> 21:45.136
and cut you out of it, honey.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.971
No, that's not magic.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.907
Yo, we're tired.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.343
We want to go to bed!

21:53.112 --> 21:56.480
The live stream
ended hours ago.

21:56.482 --> 22:00.451
Magic doesn't adhere
to the rules of time
and space.

22:00.453 --> 22:04.422
(grunting and groaning)

22:08.261 --> 22:09.760
Ta-da!

22:12.365 --> 22:15.533
Uh, excuse me.
A little applause?

22:15.535 --> 22:18.169
Oh. Whoo!
We get to go to bed!

22:18.171 --> 22:21.205
(all cheering)

22:21.207 --> 22:24.809
<i> Voila!</i>
And the family
disappears.
