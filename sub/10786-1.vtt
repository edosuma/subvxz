WEBVTT

00:34.000 --> 00:34.875
SORRY?

00:34.875 --> 00:37.166
YOU'RE DROOLING.
ON YOUR CHIN.

00:37.166 --> 00:39.500
SALIVA. FROM SLEEP.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.708
[CHUCKLES]

00:41.708 --> 00:45.375
YOU'RE
A VERY HEAVY BREATHER,
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

00:45.375 --> 00:46.375
NO.

00:46.375 --> 00:47.333
[SIGHS]

00:47.333 --> 00:50.041
AND A SCINTILLATING
CONVERSATIONALIST.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.667
JUST MY LUCK.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.375
WHAT'S IN YOUR LAP?

00:54.375 --> 00:59.000
NOT THAT. THE MOVIE.
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.834
OH, UH, RISKY BUSINESS.

01:00.834 --> 01:01.959
THE ONE WITH TOM CRUISE?

01:01.959 --> 01:02.917
AND REBECCA De MORNAY.

01:02.917 --> 01:05.875
WHERE THEY DO IT
ON A TRAIN.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.875
AND IT'S UNBELIEVABLY SWEET
AND MEANINGFUL,

01:07.875 --> 01:09.375
EVEN THOUGH HE'S A VIRGIN

01:09.375 --> 01:14.041
AND SHE'S A BATTLE-SCARRED
HOOKER WHO'S SLEPT WITH
HUNDREDS OF MEN.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.667
IT'S MORE
OF A MODERN MYTH--

01:15.667 --> 01:20.875
JOSEPH CAMPBELL MEETS
SIGMUND FREUD MEETS
HOLDEN CAULFIELD.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.375
TEENAGE BOY
PASSES INTO MANHOOD

01:22.375 --> 01:25.125
BY WAY
OF A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER
WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

01:25.125 --> 01:26.959
HE'S ESSENTIALLY
A FANTASY CHARACTER
OF HIS OWN CREATION.

01:26.959 --> 01:31.708
HEY, YOU'RE ADORABLE.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.792
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:34.792 --> 01:35.792
DAWSON.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.750
DAWSON LEERY.

01:40.792 --> 01:43.250
YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:43.250 --> 01:45.458
MY DAD TAUGHT ME:
WHEN SHAKING HANDS,

01:45.458 --> 01:47.792
ALWAYS MAKE SURE
THE OTHER GUY
RELEASES FIRST.

01:47.792 --> 01:53.708
IT IMPARTS A SUBTLE
YET POWERFUL ADVANTAGE
IN ALL HUMAN INTERCOURSE.

01:53.708 --> 01:57.458
ACTUALLY, UM...
I MEANT YOUR SKIN.

01:57.458 --> 01:58.750
DO YOU HAVE A FEVER
OR SOMETHING?

01:58.750 --> 02:00.166
OH, THAT'S JUST ME.

02:00.166 --> 02:03.500
MY TEMPERATURE.
I RUN A FEW DEGREES HOT.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.917
SO...

02:06.917 --> 02:09.834
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

03:08.875 --> 03:10.375
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.708
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
BY 8:00.

03:13.708 --> 03:16.000
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
LITTLE GIRL'S
NERVOUS ABOUT MISSING
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.417
OH, THE SALAD DAYS.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.375
YES, I REMEMBER
THEM WELL.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.083
YOU CAN SPARE ME
THE SHAKESPEARE, ROB.

03:24.083 --> 03:27.333
LISTEN, MY LAST CLASS ENDS
AT 2:30, SO I SHOULD
BE BACK HERE BY 3:00.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.834
DON'T BE LATE.

03:58.708 --> 03:59.250
AHEM.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.375
WHAT?
WHAT?

04:01.375 --> 04:04.708
AND HOW LONG HAVE
YOU TWO BEEN MARRIED?

04:09.834 --> 04:11.083
WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU WOKE UP?

04:11.083 --> 04:13.959
SHE'D MORPHED
INTO AN OCTOGENARIAN
SPANISH WOMAN

04:13.959 --> 04:14.875
WITH A HAIRY UPPER LIP.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.166
WHUH...I HATE IT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.500
IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING,
THOUGH.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.875
SHE WAS, LIKE,
THIS PERFECT GIRL.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.416
ONE MINUTE SHE'S SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO ME,

04:21.416 --> 04:23.542
AND THE NEXT MINUTE,
SHE'S GONE.

04:23.542 --> 04:25.959
YOU KNOW, USUALLY WHEN I
HAVE MOMENTS LIKE THAT,

04:25.959 --> 04:26.583
I GOTTA CHANGE
THE SHEETS AFTERWARDS.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.875
MAYBE SHE WASN'T REAL.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.291
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE
THAT IS REAL?

04:32.583 --> 04:34.417
WHAT ABOUT HER?

04:34.417 --> 04:36.000
WELL, TODAY'S THE DAY.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.375
DAWSON LEERY AND
JOEY POTTER HAVE BEEN
APART FOR MONTHS NOW.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.750
IN FACT, THE SUMMER
HAS PASSED,

04:40.750 --> 04:42.208
AND THE WORLD IS WAITING
TO FIND WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN.

04:42.208 --> 04:43.542
PERHAPS YOU
AND THE WORLD

04:43.542 --> 04:46.708
HAVEN'T HEARD
THE LAST 50,000 TIMES
I'VE SAID IT.

04:46.708 --> 04:47.917
IT'S OVER.

04:47.917 --> 04:48.917
YEAH. SURE IT'S OVER
UNTIL SHE SPEAKS TO YOU.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.917
SHE WON'T.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.750
I THINK
YOU UNDERESTIMATE

04:53.750 --> 04:54.834
THE HEALING POWERS
OF TIME, DAWSON...

04:54.834 --> 04:58.041
YOU KNOW, TIME FOR JOEY
TO FORGIVE AND FORGET.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.458
EVEN IF JOEY
CAME UP TO ME TODAY

04:59.458 --> 05:01.166
AND SAID,
"I FORGIVE AND I FORGET,"

05:01.166 --> 05:02.792
I WOULDN'T.

05:02.792 --> 05:06.792
I WOULDN'T FORGET
THAT MOST OF THE PAST YEAR
HAS BEEN A HELLISH NIGHTMARE.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.375
IT'S BEEN VERBALIZING
AND ANGSTING INSTEAD
OF LIVING.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.166
I NEED TO JUST
LEARN HOW TO EXIST

05:11.166 --> 05:13.166
AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.041
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

05:14.041 --> 05:16.959
CAPESIDIANS OF ALL AGES,

05:16.959 --> 05:19.125
NEW AND IMPROVED
AND FRESH
FROM PHILADELPHIA,

05:19.125 --> 05:20.208
I BRING YOU...

05:20.208 --> 05:22.708
DAWSON LEERY.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.959
NOW, JUST TO PLAY
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE,

05:25.959 --> 05:28.166
LET'S SAY YOU
GO TO SCHOOL TODAY

05:28.166 --> 05:30.708
AND JOEY COMES UP
AND STARTS APOLOGIZING
TO YOU.

05:30.708 --> 05:33.458
SHE DOES THAT CUTE
HAIR-FLIP THING
SHE DOES, AND THEN SHE

05:33.458 --> 05:37.375
LOCKS THOSE TRULY, TRULY
REMARKABLE BROWN EYES
OF HERS ON YOU.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.250
WHAT DO YOU DO?

05:40.250 --> 05:43.250
I TELL HER THAT IT'S OVER
AND THAT IT'S BEEN OVER

05:43.250 --> 05:46.291
AND THAT
WE'RE BOTH BETTER OFF
WITHOUT EACH OTHER.

05:46.291 --> 05:49.166
DAWSON, I'M OFF
TO MY COACHING CONFERENCE.

05:49.166 --> 05:53.333
I'LL WRITE DOWN THE NUMBER
AT THE HOTEL WHERE I'LL BE.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.333
COACHING CONFERENCE?

05:54.333 --> 05:57.166
WHAT? YOU
HAVEN'T HEARD YET?

05:57.166 --> 06:01.333
SUBSTITUTE MITCH
IS CAPESIDE HIGH SCHOOL'S
NEWEST VARSITY FOOTBALL COACH.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.166
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. LEERY.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.417
HOW ARE OUR TRUSTY
MINUTEMEN DOING?

06:04.417 --> 06:05.750
WHAT'S THE STREAK
AT NOW?

06:05.750 --> 06:07.834
IT'S LIKE 0 AND 38,
RIGHT? OR 39?

06:07.834 --> 06:10.125
YE PACEY OF LITTLE FAITH.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.917
I CAN ASSURE YOU
AS A FORMER MINUTEMAN MYSELF

06:12.917 --> 06:16.041
THAT THIS SEASON
WILL BE A WINNING ONE.

06:16.041 --> 06:17.500
THANKS.
SEE YA SUNDAY, DAD.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.041
ALL RIGHT.

06:20.041 --> 06:23.792
THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE GONNA WALK OUT,
JUST LIKE THAT?

06:23.792 --> 06:26.834
NO FATHERLY WARNINGS,
NO RULES AND
REGULATIONS,

06:26.834 --> 06:31.125
NO PROMISES OF IMPENDING
DOOM SHOULD YOUR SAINTED
SON HERE MISBEHAVE?

06:31.125 --> 06:31.875
GOOD IDEA.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.542
KEEP PACEY OUT OF THE HOUSE.

06:36.083 --> 06:38.291
[BELL RINGS]

06:39.708 --> 06:40.875
IF I START TO FALL ASLEEP,
DON'T WAKE ME, HEAR?

06:40.875 --> 06:42.750
[GASP]

06:42.750 --> 06:45.542
JEN LINDLEY,
HOW WAS YOUR SUMMER?

06:45.542 --> 06:47.708
HOST ANY GANG BANGS?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.166
YOU KNOW, BELINDA,

06:49.166 --> 06:51.458
I COULD THINK
OF A REALLY SCATHING
COMEBACK RIGHT NOW,

06:51.458 --> 06:53.834
BUT I FIGURE
THAT I SHOULD SHOW YOU
A LITTLE SYMPATHY,

06:53.834 --> 06:55.667
SEEING AS HOW THE LIPO
DIDN'T TAKE.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.250
SHE SHOULD
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.667
I'M TELLIN' YA.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.375
IT'S THE JUNIOR
ASSEMBLY, MAN.
SHE HAS TO COME.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.500
THAT'S ENOUGH,
ALL RIGHT?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.375
GOOD MORNING.
I'M PRINCIPAL GREEN.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.583
LIKE ALL OF YOU,

07:10.583 --> 07:13.500
IN MY JUNIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL
I HAD A NEW PRINCIPAL.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.166
MY FIRST DAY BACK,
HE STOOD BEFORE US

07:15.166 --> 07:18.333
AND IMPARTED SOME EARNEST
AND TOUCHING WORDS,

07:18.333 --> 07:20.166
WORDS WHICH
WERE MEANT TO USHER US

07:20.166 --> 07:23.583
INTO WHAT HE CALLED ONE OF
THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.250
THIS IS NOT THAT SPEECH.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.250
WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT TIME.

07:27.250 --> 07:30.959
YOU CHILDREN ARE LIVING
AND THINKING LIKE PEOPLE
TWICE YOUR AGE,

07:30.959 --> 07:32.083
AND WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?

07:32.083 --> 07:35.458
THE RITES OF PASSAGE
WHICH ONCE MARKED GROWING UP

07:35.458 --> 07:37.708
ARE ALL BUT EXTINCT...

07:37.708 --> 07:39.291
SHE JUST WALKED IN.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.208
IN SHORT,
I'M ONTO YOU PEOPLE...

07:41.208 --> 07:42.792
SHE'S RIGHT BACK THERE,
JUST OVER MY RIGHT
SHOULDER.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.583
AND I'M ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU.

07:44.583 --> 07:48.083
FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THAT GENTLEMAN
IN THE FIFTH ROW WHO'S TALKING.

07:51.458 --> 07:52.834
ME?

07:52.834 --> 07:54.417
PLEASE STAND, SIR.

07:54.417 --> 07:56.291
THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.917
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SIR?

07:57.917 --> 08:00.750
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D
ACCEPT CHE GUEVERA
WOULD YOU?

08:00.750 --> 08:02.125
[LAUGHTER]
PROBABLY NOT.

08:02.125 --> 08:03.125
PACEY WITTER.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.125

08:04.125 --> 08:05.750
MR. WITTER,
I'D LIKE TO APPLAUD YOU...

08:05.750 --> 08:09.208
FOR BEING THE FIRST STUDENT
I'VE MET AT CAPESIDE

08:09.208 --> 08:10.417
WHO BEHAVES LIKE ONE.

08:10.417 --> 08:14.417
IT IS MY HOPE THAT SOMEDAY
YOU ALL WILL ACT AS SUCH.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.750
RECLAIM YOUR YOUTH...

08:16.750 --> 08:17.166
LIVE, LEARN...

08:17.166 --> 08:19.125
SCREW UP.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.125
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,
MR. WITTER.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.667
[APPLAUSE]

08:23.083 --> 08:26.834
AND, UH...

08:26.834 --> 08:29.333
I'LL SEE YOU ON SATURDAY...

08:29.333 --> 08:31.041
FOR DETENTION.

08:33.417 --> 08:35.582
SALLY,
WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

08:35.582 --> 08:38.457
LAY OFF THE HOT DOGS
AND TRY 4-H.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.875
THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR THE PRIZED HOGS.

08:40.875 --> 08:41.958
SHE ONLY CAME OVER HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

08:41.958 --> 08:44.625
BECAUSE SOMEBODY MADE
ONE TOO MANY PIT STOPS

08:44.625 --> 08:46.583
AT KRISPY KREME
THIS SUMMER.

08:46.583 --> 08:47.625
NOW I KNOW
HOW ANTHROPOLOGISTS FEEL

08:47.625 --> 08:50.917
WHEN THEY STUMBLE
ACROSS A LOST TRIBE

08:50.917 --> 08:53.750
WHOSE ANCIENT RITUALS
HAVE REMAINED UNTOUCHED
BY TIME.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.708
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE

08:56.708 --> 09:01.250
WOULD WANT TO
BECOME A CHEERLEADER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.708
THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.667
JEN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:07.667 --> 09:08.125
I'M SIGNING UP
FOR TRYOUTS.

09:08.125 --> 09:09.375
HA HA HA!

09:09.375 --> 09:12.375
LET ME THINK
ABOUT THAT--NOT.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.041
COME ON, BELINDA.

09:14.041 --> 09:17.708
HAVEN'T YOU EVER WONDERED
IF I'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES
TO HOLD UP THOSE POM-POMS?

09:17.708 --> 09:20.333
OK, LINDLEY.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.125
YOU'RE ON.
TOMORROW AT 3:00.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.125
BE PROMPT.

09:23.125 --> 09:26.375
WILL DO.

09:26.375 --> 09:27.959
MR. GREEN SEEMED
LIKE A PRETTY COOL GUY,

09:27.959 --> 09:29.834
YOU KNOW,
GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

09:29.834 --> 09:32.208
HE WAS KIDDING
ABOUT THAT WHOLE SATURDAY
DETENTION THING, RIGHT?

09:32.208 --> 09:34.875
NO, PACE. HE SEEMED--

09:34.875 --> 09:35.959
DAWSON?

09:36.834 --> 09:38.000
[SNAP]

09:38.000 --> 09:39.417
DAWSON, IS THERE AN ENDING
TO THAT SENTENCE, OR...

09:39.417 --> 09:42.667
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M GONNA BREAK.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.125
I'M GONNA CRUMBLE.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.500
JOEY POTTER AT 3:00.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.417
OOH.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.583
JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE.
ANYWHERE.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.750
ANYWHERE?

09:50.750 --> 09:54.083
ANYWHERE
THAT JOEY POTTER
WILL NOT FIND ME.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.333
WELL, FOR A MERE $25,
YOUNG SIR,

09:56.333 --> 09:58.000
I THINK
I HAVE JUST THE PLACE.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.417
HEY, JO.

10:08.417 --> 10:11.125
OH, IT'S NOT JOEY.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.583
IT'S THE SHELL OF
HER EXHAUSTED REMAINS.

10:13.583 --> 10:17.250
I SWEAR, BESSIE, IF I
HAVE TO WORK ANOTHER HOUR
FOR THAT NIMROD OF A BOSS.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.208
LOOK, IT'S JUST UNTIL
THE INSURANCE CHECK
COMES THROUGH,

10:19.208 --> 10:22.708
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE
ENOUGH TO GET A SITTER,
AND I'LL GET A JOB.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.000
NO SPEECH REQUIRED.
I REMEMBER THE BARGAIN...

10:25.000 --> 10:26.542
[SOFTLY]
IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.333
SO, TELL ME EVERYTHING.

10:27.333 --> 10:30.667
WE GOT A NEW PRINCIPAL.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.291
NOT ABOUT SCHOOL.
ABOUT DAWSON.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.333
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
SEEING HIM AGAIN?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.166
UH...IT WAS GREAT.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.792
SO WHAT'D HE SAY?

10:41.792 --> 10:43.166
COME ON, JOEY,

10:43.166 --> 10:45.834
I SPEND MOST
OF MY CONVERSATIONS
WITH A TEETHING BABY.

10:45.834 --> 10:48.083
YOUR SISTER
COULD USE A LITTLE
VICARIOUS PLEASURE.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.667
COME ON.

10:55.542 --> 10:56.625
WELL, HE, UM...

10:56.625 --> 11:01.125
I MEAN, HE LOOKED
AT ME AND...

11:01.125 --> 11:04.875
I LOOKED AT HIM AND...

11:04.875 --> 11:08.125
IN THAT SPLIT SECOND,
IT WAS LIKE...

11:08.125 --> 11:09.834
WE FORGAVE EACH OTHER
FOR EVERYTHING.

11:12.583 --> 11:16.000
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
WE TALKED ABOUT IT UNTIL
WE WERE BLUE IN THE FACE,

11:16.000 --> 11:17.166
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.125
I'M GLAD, JO.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.708
YOU TWO ARE MEANT
FOR EACH OTHER.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.208
NOW, IF
I'M SURE OF ANYTHING,

11:21.208 --> 11:22.834
THAT'S IT.

11:30.917 --> 11:34.166
I THINK I'M HAVING
A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.458
THAT WOULD BE WENDY,

11:35.458 --> 11:39.375
"WHO IS A SECOND-YEAR
BIOLOGY STUDENT
AT WOODS HOLE."

11:39.375 --> 11:40.375
HOW ON EARTH
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

11:40.375 --> 11:41.542
IT'S IN HER BIO.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.250
AND, ACCORDING TO THIS,

11:43.250 --> 11:48.458
"SHE ALSO LIKES SMALL CHILDREN,
BIG MEN, SNOW BOARDING,
AND THE COLOR GREEN."

11:49.250 --> 11:50.959
WHAT CAN I
GET YOU GENTLEMEN?

11:50.959 --> 11:52.834
WELL, I WOULD LOVE
A COUPLE OF BEERS,

11:52.834 --> 11:56.458
AND MY FRIEND HERE
WILL HAVE A TALL GLASS
OF MILK.

11:58.458 --> 12:02.208
YOU KNOW, SITTING HERE,
SOMETHING OCCURS TO ME,
DAWSON.

12:02.208 --> 12:03.375
WHAT?

12:03.375 --> 12:06.792
THE MEANING OF LIFE,
SPECIFICALLY YOURS.

12:06.792 --> 12:09.542
PACEY, NOT ANOTHER
DIATRIBE ON MY MANHOOD
OR LACK THEREOF.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.000
I'M BEING SERIOUS HERE.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.083
I HAVE JUST
HAD A BLINDING VISION

12:13.083 --> 12:15.792
OF THE PURPOSE
OF YOUR JUNIOR YEAR.

12:15.792 --> 12:19.875
YOU MEAN, BESIDES,
MASSIVE AND DEBILITATING
COLLEGE ANXIETY?

12:19.875 --> 12:22.708
YES. AT SOME POINT
DURING THIS YEAR,

12:22.708 --> 12:25.458
YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE GOING TO GET LAID.

12:25.458 --> 12:28.375
COME ON, MAN.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.041
IT'S IN KEEPING WITH
THIS WHOLE NEW ATTITUDE
THING YOU GOT GOIN'.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.625
I MEAN, YOU MET THAT GIRL
ON THE BUS, DIDN'T YOU?

12:32.625 --> 12:36.250
YEAH, I PUT HER TO SLEEP
BY TALKING ABOUT MY
EX-GIRLFRIEND, PACEY.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.792
I THINK IT'S
PRETTY SAFE TO ASSUME

12:37.792 --> 12:39.750
I'M NOT GOING TO
BE HEARING FROM HER
ANY TIME SOON.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.917
THANK YOU.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.083
UM...AHEM...

12:48.083 --> 12:49.834
THIS IS ACTUALLY
ROOT BEER.

12:49.834 --> 12:52.875
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU?

12:52.875 --> 12:54.333
SHOULD I?

12:54.333 --> 12:56.625
FEEL THIS.

12:58.291 --> 13:00.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.500
IT'S ME.

13:14.959 --> 13:18.458
AND AS DAY NUMBER 2
DAWNS ON OUR QUIET,
LITTLE, CREEKSIDE VILLAGE,

13:18.458 --> 13:19.917
DAWSON LEERY
HAS, ONCE AGAIN,
PROVEN HIMSELF SUCCESSFUL

13:19.917 --> 13:23.208
IN HIS ENDEAVOR
TO AVOID MISS JOEY POTTER.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.917
HOWEVER, I AM STARTING
TO QUESTION YOUR COMMITMENT
TO THE VIDA LOCA.

13:25.917 --> 13:28.625
WHAT? 'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO MY EX?

13:28.625 --> 13:29.542
NO, MAN,
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T HOOK UP
WITH BUS GIRL LAST NIGHT.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.333
SHE WAS WORKING.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.750
YOU SAW ME
GIVE HER MY NUMBER.

13:33.750 --> 13:34.542
IT'S UP TO HER
TO USE IT.

13:34.542 --> 13:36.458
AND IF SHE DOES?

13:36.458 --> 13:37.708
SHE WON'T.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.917
DAWSON, I WOULDN'T
BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.458
WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD
THAT A WOMAN

13:41.458 --> 13:44.542
WITH THAT DEGREE
OF LIFE EXPERIENCE
AND SEXUAL LIBERATION

13:44.542 --> 13:45.625
IS GONNA TO REGARD
SERIOUSLY THE INTEREST

13:45.625 --> 13:47.417
OF SOMEONE WHO HASN'T
EVEN TAKEN HIS PSATs?

13:52.291 --> 13:53.583
I'D SAY ABOUT THE SAME

13:53.583 --> 13:55.458
AS THE CHANCES
OF HER BEING HERE
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM.

13:55.458 --> 13:56.291
HI, DAWSON.

13:56.291 --> 13:59.417
HI.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.333
UM, WHAT ARE YOU DO--

14:01.333 --> 14:04.166
UM, I'M SORRY.
HOW DID YOU, UM...

14:04.166 --> 14:06.000
UH...DID YOU JUST--

14:06.000 --> 14:09.583
THIS IS ALL OVEREXCITED
TEENAGE MALE FOR,
"HOW DID YOU GET IN?"

14:09.583 --> 14:11.125
THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE YOU

14:11.125 --> 14:13.417
AND TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER FOR A DATE.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.583
IT WAS HOT OUTSIDE,
AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN,

14:14.583 --> 14:17.667
SO I LET MYSELF IN.

14:17.667 --> 14:21.959
IT'S CAPESIDE.
WE DON'T EXACTLY LOCK UP.

14:21.959 --> 14:24.792
HMM...INTERESTING.

14:24.792 --> 14:26.417
WHAT ELSE DON'T YOU DO?

14:27.333 --> 14:30.834
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.250
OK, NORMALLY,
AT THIS POINT
IN THE PLOT,

14:35.250 --> 14:36.834
THE BEST FRIEND
EXITS STAGE LEFT,

14:36.834 --> 14:39.291
LEAVING THE BRAND-NEW
DAWSON LEERY ALL ALONE

14:39.291 --> 14:42.291
WITH THE MYSTERY WOMAN
IN HIS PARENTLESS HOUSE.

14:42.291 --> 14:44.917
I'M FREEZIN' UP.
THIS IS JUST
A LITTLE TOO HIGH IN

14:44.917 --> 14:46.959
THE TOO-GOOD-TO-BE-TRUE
CATEGORY.

14:46.959 --> 14:48.083
I UNDERSTAND,

14:48.083 --> 14:49.834
BUT SPEAKING AS SOMEBODY
WHO'S BEEN THERE BEFORE,

14:49.834 --> 14:53.458
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
ALL YOU NEED NOW IS JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF SEPARATION,

14:53.458 --> 14:56.000
A LITTLE TIME
TO CALM DOWN,
TO CATCH YOUR BREATH,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.708
AND REALIZE THAT YOU
ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL
OF THIS SITUATION.

15:00.708 --> 15:02.875
I AM NOT IN COMPLETE CONTROL.

15:02.875 --> 15:05.041
OH, BUT YOU WILL BE.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.875
THE BOAT.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.250
WHAT ABOUT IT?

15:09.250 --> 15:12.375
WELL, I THINK YOU
SHOULD TAKE IT OUT
FOR A LITTLE SPIN.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.166
PACEY, THAT'S MY DAD'S BOAT.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.291
"DAD" BEING THE POSSESSIVE
IN THAT SENTENCE.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.083
DAWSON, GIVEN
THE CIRCUMSTANCES...

15:21.417 --> 15:24.333
I THINK HE'D UNDERSTAND.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.417

FINISH MY CHEER.

15:48.417 --> 15:50.417
UM...

15:50.417 --> 15:53.792
STACEY, GET A MIT
AND CATCH A CLUE.

15:53.792 --> 15:57.542
IT'S YOUR THIRD YEAR
TRYING OUT
FOR THE MINUTEGIRLS.

15:57.542 --> 15:58.500
YOUR WAISTLINE
IS THICKER.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.500
YOUR HAIRSTYLE IS
EVEN MORE OUTDATED.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.125
THE ONLY REASON WE
LET YOU GET THIS FAR
IN THE FIRST PLACE

16:04.125 --> 16:05.625
IS BECAUSE WE WANTED
TO SEE WHAT LAME

16:05.625 --> 16:07.625
TO CHEER TO.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.834
MISS JEN LINDLEY.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.667
DO YOU STILL
WANNA DO THIS?

16:16.667 --> 16:19.625
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.750
GOOD LUCK.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.417
I'M SURE YOU'LL
DAZZLE US, JEN.

16:27.417 --> 16:31.041
I MEAN,
AFTER ALL, WE ALL KNOW
HOW FLEXIBLE YOU ARE.

16:39.834 --> 16:42.792
WHEN YOU SEE BELINDA
AND HER CLIQUE
IN THE HALLWAY,

16:42.792 --> 16:46.375
YOU'RE DESPERATELY WISHING
THAT YOU WERE WALKING
WITH THEM, AREN'T YOU?

16:46.375 --> 16:50.667
AND THINKING
THAT MAYBE IF YOU WERE
WEARING THE RIGHT SHOES,

16:50.667 --> 16:51.708
SPORTING
THE LATEST HAIRSTYLE

16:51.708 --> 16:54.542
AND USING THE HOTTEST SHADE
OF LIP GLOSS,

16:54.542 --> 16:57.834
THEN--THEN MAYBE
THEY WOULD TOSS A GLANCE
IN YOUR DIRECTION.

16:57.834 --> 17:02.041
EVER WONDER WHY THEY FORCE
THEIR NARROW-MINDED OPINIONS
DOWN OUR THROATS?

17:02.041 --> 17:04.541
PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HAVE AN INKLING

17:04.541 --> 17:09.290
OF WHAT THE FUTURE
HAS IN STORE FOR THEM
BEYOND GRADUATION.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.834
CUT TO 25 YEARS FROM NOW.

17:11.834 --> 17:14.750
BELINDA McGOVERN WAKES UP
ONE MORNING FEELING EMPTY.

17:14.750 --> 17:18.916
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
HER DARTMOUTH-EDUCATED
LAWYER HUSBAND TAD

17:18.916 --> 17:23.290
HAS RUN OFF TO TIJUANA
WITH HER DAUGHTER'S ROOMMATE
FROM BOARDING SCHOOL,

17:23.290 --> 17:26.040
OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
THE TWINS--TIMMY AND TOMMY--

17:26.040 --> 17:29.500
CALL HER BY HER FIRST NAME
AND THEIR LIVE-IN
HOUSEKEEPER, "MOM,"

17:29.500 --> 17:33.417
OR MAYBE IT'S BELINDA'S
DAILY 2:00, 5:00, 7:00,

17:33.417 --> 17:35.250
AND 9:15 SHOWDOWN
WITH HER BOTTLE OF PROZAC.

17:35.250 --> 17:39.375
HER LIFE HAS BECOME
A DOMESTIC WASTELAND.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.708
AVOID THIS FATE.

17:40.708 --> 17:44.125
DON'T LET YOURSELF
BECOME ANOTHER

YOU WERE BACK HERE.

TO GET THIRSTY

18:24.208 --> 18:26.875

THAT COINCIDENCE.

OH.

18:28.875 --> 18:29.917
YOU KNOW...

18:29.917 --> 18:33.708

THE NEXT TIME.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.667
WHAT ARE YOU STARIN' AT?

19:01.667 --> 19:05.291
YOU SHOULD
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.

19:05.917 --> 19:08.291
WHAT'S THE MATTER,

TOO BRAZEN FOR YOU?

NO. NO.

19:13.417 --> 19:14.917
I GUESS I'M JUST
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

19:14.917 --> 19:18.291
HOW COME YOU'RE NERVOUS?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.708
FOR THE SAME REASON
YOU'RE NOT.

19:20.708 --> 19:21.875
OH.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.166
BUT I AM.

OF COURSE.

LISTEN, DAWSON,

19:31.041 --> 19:34.166
ANYTHING THAT'S
WORTH ANYTHING IS SCARY.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.000
OR DANGEROUS

19:36.000 --> 19:37.834
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.667

BE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

OF OUR LIMITATIONS...

COMES BEFORE.

22:49.834 --> 22:52.083
THINGS COULD BE WORSE.

22:53.375 --> 22:55.000
THAT'S WHAT
THEY SAID TO KING LEAR

22:55.000 --> 22:57.750
BEFORE HE LOST HIS MIND
AND HIS DAUGHTER
KILLED HERSELF.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.333
OR WAS IT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

22:59.333 --> 23:02.625
COME ON, DAWSON.
NO ONE WAS HURT,

23:02.625 --> 23:07.083
AND YOU'LL NEVER
FORGET THIS DAY AS LONG
AS YOU LIVE.

23:07.083 --> 23:09.000
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.333
EVERYBODY ALWAYS WANTS
LIFE TO GO SMOOTHLY,

23:11.333 --> 23:15.125
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
IT'S THE MISTAKES THAT
KEEP THINGS INTERESTING.

23:15.125 --> 23:19.792
ANOTHER TREACLY TRUISM,
AND I THINK MY SWEET TOOTH
IS GONNA START TO ACHE.

23:19.792 --> 23:21.625
WAIT A SECOND.

23:21.625 --> 23:22.542
YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

23:25.834 --> 23:28.542
YOU MADE ME CRASH
MY FATHER'S BOAT.

23:28.542 --> 23:29.875
MADE YOU WHAT?

23:29.875 --> 23:32.542
I DIDN'T
MAKE YOU DO ANYTHING.

23:32.542 --> 23:33.125
[SIGH]

23:33.125 --> 23:35.375
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:35.375 --> 23:36.750
MAYBE I'M JUST
NOT READY FOR THIS,
FOR ANY OF THIS.

23:36.750 --> 23:40.083
READY? DAWSON, I'VE ONLY
KNOWN YOU FOR 48 HOURS,

23:40.083 --> 23:42.458
BUT I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY

23:42.458 --> 23:46.542
YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP
LIVING FROM THE NECK UP.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.041
NO. WAIT. DON'T GO.

23:48.041 --> 23:50.792
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO
A LOT BETTER THAN THAT.

23:50.792 --> 23:53.834
A MAN'S CHARACTER
IS HIS FATE.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.250
AND?

23:56.250 --> 23:57.959
THIS ISN'T ME.

23:57.959 --> 23:59.750
OK, I DON'T MEET
STRANGE GIRLS ON BUSSES.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.667
I DON'T DRIVE
MY FATHER'S BOAT
WITHOUT PERMISSION,

24:02.667 --> 24:04.291
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I DO:

24:04.291 --> 24:06.417
UNMITIGATED DISASTER.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.166
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

'CAUSE THIS GIRL
JUST WANTS TO HAVE FUN.

DON'T YOU?

WHAT IS IT?

24:38.542 --> 24:40.291
THE UNTHINKABLE
HAS HAPPENED.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.083
GOOD JOB,

24:42.083 --> 24:44.041
WHAT?

24:44.041 --> 24:45.458
YOU'VE BECOME POPULAR?

24:45.458 --> 24:47.959
WORSE.

24:47.959 --> 24:50.458
IT WAS A COUP DéTAT,
A MUTINY,

24:50.458 --> 24:52.208
A SLAVE REVOLT, REALLY.

YOU SAID THAT--

FORGET WHAT I SAID.
I WAS LYING,

25:22.708 --> 25:25.542

FOR THE BEST.

25:25.542 --> 25:28.000

HAS BEEN DODGING ME
FOR THE PAST 2 DAYS.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.667

MITCH'S PRIDE AND JOY?

25:31.667 --> 25:34.959
IT'S LIKE ONE DAWSON
LEFT FOR PHILADELPHIA,

25:34.959 --> 25:35.542
AND ANOTHER ONE
CAME BACK.

25:35.542 --> 25:37.959

25:38.959 --> 25:40.875

HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME,

FEEL LIKE SUCH A FOOL.

ABOUT THE GIRL,
YOU MEAN?

25:46.333 --> 25:47.750
ONE LOOK AT HER,
AND I KNEW.

WAS ANOTHER BLONDE

34:30.375 --> 34:32.208
IT'S US.

34:33.667 --> 34:36.375
I CAN'T GO
THROUGH IT ALL AGAIN.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.500
AND YOU'RE SAYIN'
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT,

34:38.500 --> 34:39.083
BUT IT WON'T BE.

34:39.083 --> 34:41.291
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

34:41.291 --> 34:43.375
YES, I DO.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.375
AND SO DO YOU.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.833
JOEY...

34:47.833 --> 34:50.291
ONE MORE YEAR
LIKE LAST YEAR,
AND I CAN PROMISE YOU,

34:50.291 --> 34:53.166
THERE WILL BE NO LOVE
LEFT BETWEEN US.

34:53.166 --> 34:54.917
DAWSON...

34:54.917 --> 34:57.458
IS THERE ANY NOW?

35:00.333 --> 35:01.875
YES.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.125
SO, YOU LOVE ME?

35:07.667 --> 35:10.417
YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.041
WHOO!

35:32.041 --> 35:33.000
YEE-HAW!

35:33.000 --> 35:36.458
WHOO!
COME ON. YEAH!

35:39.333 --> 35:42.417
COME HERE, BABY!

35:42.417 --> 35:45.375
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

35:51.500 --> 35:53.083
YO!

35:53.083 --> 35:55.166
COULD I GET EVERYBODY'S
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

35:55.166 --> 35:56.417
EVERYBODY!

35:56.417 --> 35:58.458
ALL RIGHT.

35:58.458 --> 36:01.708
GENTLEMEN, AND ESTEEMED
EXOTIC DANCERS,

36:01.708 --> 36:03.625
NOW, I'D LIKE TO
PRESENT TO YOU

36:03.625 --> 36:05.834
THE MAN WHO MADE THIS
ALL POSSIBLE...

36:05.834 --> 36:08.750
MR. DAWSON LEERY!

36:10.166 --> 36:11.750
ALL RIGHT, NOW.

36:11.750 --> 36:13.750
I THINK
THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS

36:13.750 --> 36:15.291
OF OUR LITTLE
PLEDGE DRIVE ARE IN,

36:15.291 --> 36:18.041
SO, GINO, IF I COULD
HAVE THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE.

36:18.041 --> 36:22.834
THE UNOFFICIAL TALLY
FOR TONIGHT'S FESTIVITIES
COMES TO...

36:22.834 --> 36:27.583
$3,162!

36:27.583 --> 36:29.000
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!

36:29.000 --> 36:30.625
NOW, CALL ME CRAZY...

36:30.625 --> 36:32.208
CALL ME INSANE...

36:32.208 --> 36:34.417
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
TO OPEN THIS THING UP
TO THE PUBLIC,

36:34.417 --> 36:35.417
WHAT DO YA SAY?

36:35.417 --> 36:38.375
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!

36:44.542 --> 36:45.500
COME ON.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.041
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

36:47.041 --> 36:48.834
I HAVE A SURPRISE.

36:48.834 --> 36:51.041
I SHOULD PROBABLY STAY

36:51.041 --> 36:52.041
AND MAKE SURE NOBODY
BURNS MY HOUSE DOWN, RIGHT?

36:52.041 --> 36:54.792
AND WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT?

36:54.792 --> 36:58.208
TO AVOID WONDERING
WHETHER OR NOT I'M
GOING TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

36:58.208 --> 36:59.875
FOLLOW ME, DAWSON...

36:59.875 --> 37:02.875
AND ALL SECRETS
WILL BE REVEALED.

37:02.875 --> 37:04.875
YOU GO AHEAD.

37:04.875 --> 37:07.000
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.083
OH.

37:21.834 --> 37:25.291
SHE WANTS ME BACK.

37:25.291 --> 37:26.291
JOEY?

37:26.291 --> 37:27.250
YEAH.

37:27.250 --> 37:28.500
AND AS WE SPEAK,

37:28.500 --> 37:31.959
THE EVER-TEMPTING EVE
STANDS WAITING
IN THE WINGS.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.125
WELL, IT ALWAYS
COMES DOWN TO THIS,
DOESN'T IT, MY FRIEND:

37:34.125 --> 37:36.750
THE MADONNA
OR THE JEZEBEL?

37:36.750 --> 37:38.959
OH, GOD, YOU SHOULDA
SEEN HER, PACE.

37:38.959 --> 37:44.083
SHE WAS STANDING BEFORE ME
AS INNOCENT AND AS BEAUTIFUL
AS SHE'S EVER BEEN,

37:44.083 --> 37:46.041
AND I WANTED HER JUST
AS MUCH AS I EVER HAVE,

37:46.041 --> 37:50.458
BUT--I DON'T KNOW--
AS LARGE A PART OF ME
WANTED HER,

37:50.458 --> 37:52.208
THERE'S A PART OF ME
JUST AS LARGE THAT--

37:52.208 --> 37:54.417
THAT KNOWS THAT NOW
IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME
FOR US.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.750
YEAH.

37:57.750 --> 38:00.625
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT SHE'S OK.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.250
COULD YOU TALK TO HER,

38:02.250 --> 38:04.083
MAYBE WATCH OUT FOR HER
FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE
OF DAYS?

38:04.083 --> 38:06.792
OH, NO, NO, NO.

38:06.792 --> 38:08.000
PACEY, SHE NEEDS SOMEBODY.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.083
SHE'D NEVER EVER ADMIT IT,
BUT SHE DOES.

38:10.083 --> 38:11.792
DAWSON, MAN!

38:11.792 --> 38:15.458
LOOK, YOU'D BE DOING IT
AS A FAVOR TO ME.

38:15.458 --> 38:18.000
PACE, PLEASE?

38:18.792 --> 38:20.708
YEAH.

38:21.125 --> 38:23.041
THANK YOU.

38:30.208 --> 38:33.000
YOU WANNA GO FOR A RIDE?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.625
IS THAT YOURS?

38:34.625 --> 38:36.333
IT'S MY BOSS'.

38:36.333 --> 38:39.542
TALKED HIM INTO
LETTING ME BORROW IT.

38:41.959 --> 38:46.750
I WAS KINDA HOPING WE'D
GRADUATED FROM THE OPEN
OCEAN TO DRY LAND.

38:47.625 --> 38:50.166
IF AT FIRST
YOU DON'T SUCCEED...

38:50.166 --> 38:53.333
MITCH: DAWSON!

38:53.333 --> 38:54.125
Eve: WHO'S THAT?

38:54.125 --> 38:57.333
THAT'S MY FATHER.

39:01.333 --> 39:02.375
[CHUCKLES]

39:02.375 --> 39:04.250
UNEXPECTEDLY HOME
FROM THE HILL.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.208
LISTEN, DAWSON,

39:06.208 --> 39:08.625
YOU ARE ONE STEP AWAY
FROM THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.375
GET IN.

39:15.875 --> 39:19.166
I CRASHED HIS BOAT,
AND I WRECKED HIS HOUSE.

39:19.166 --> 39:20.208
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

39:20.208 --> 39:23.333
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO TONIGHT ANYWAY.

39:23.333 --> 39:24.667
BE HONEST.

39:24.667 --> 39:28.208
WHAT'S GOING TO
CHANGE BETWEEN NOW
AND TOMORROW MORNING?

39:30.542 --> 39:31.583
NOTHING.

39:33.708 --> 39:37.667
EXCEPT MAYBE ME.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.917
LAST CHANCE.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.208
I CAN'T.

39:48.208 --> 39:50.333
[CHUCKLES]

39:50.333 --> 39:51.542
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAWSON?

39:51.542 --> 39:55.708
I DON'T KNOW
WHO'S THE BIGGER MYSTERY--

39:55.708 --> 39:56.917
ME...

39:56.917 --> 39:58.625
OR YOU.

40:29.291 --> 40:31.500
Pacey:
AHOY, THERE!

40:31.500 --> 40:32.875
ANYONE ASHORE?

40:32.875 --> 40:34.458
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

40:34.458 --> 40:37.041
WELL, IT'S
THE DAMNEDEST THING.

40:37.041 --> 40:39.208
I JUST GOT
INTO DAWSON'S ROWBOAT

40:39.208 --> 40:42.083
AND MAGICALLY DRIFTED
TOWARDS YOUR DOCK.

40:42.083 --> 40:45.458
YEAH, WELL, MAGICALLY
DRIFT ANY CLOSER,
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

40:45.458 --> 40:49.291
YOU KNOW, I ALMOST
BELIEVE THAT.

41:02.291 --> 41:03.959
HE TOLD YOU, DIDN'T HE?

41:03.959 --> 41:05.959
DIDN'T HE?

41:05.959 --> 41:07.792
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41:10.291 --> 41:13.250
I THINK I HATE YOU BOTH.

41:13.250 --> 41:14.417
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
REALLY GONNA HATE ME

41:14.417 --> 41:17.500
WHEN YOU HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

41:19.792 --> 41:22.208
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.

41:23.917 --> 41:27.250
THE TWO OF YOU NEED TO
BE APART RIGHT NOW.

41:28.083 --> 41:30.125
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
WHAT I NEED?

41:30.125 --> 41:32.708
YEAH.

41:32.708 --> 41:34.792
[CHUCKLES]

41:34.792 --> 41:36.792
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

41:36.792 --> 41:39.792
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
KNOW HOW HARD IT IS

41:39.792 --> 41:41.917
TO LET SOMEBODY GO,
RIGHT?

41:43.333 --> 41:47.750
THE PAIN OF KNOWING...

41:47.750 --> 41:51.500
THAT EVEN THOUGH
THE TWO OF YOU ARE RIGHT
FOR EACH OTHER,

41:51.500 --> 41:53.792
THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY MEAN

41:53.792 --> 41:55.792
THAT YOU'RE
RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER
RIGHT NOW.

41:58.041 --> 42:01.125
WHAT WOULD I KNOW
ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

42:02.834 --> 42:05.166
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
KNOW THAT SOMETIMES

42:05.166 --> 42:06.458
IT JUST...

42:06.458 --> 42:08.250
MAKES YOU
WANT TO SCREAM...

42:08.250 --> 42:11.834
HIT SOMEBODY...

42:11.834 --> 42:15.125
SIT OUT ON THE END
OF A DOCK AND CRY?

42:19.166 --> 42:23.125
OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS,
IT HAD TO BE YOU.

42:25.917 --> 42:28.708
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A NEW YEAR.

42:28.708 --> 42:29.708
WHO KNOWS?

42:29.708 --> 42:33.041
YOU AND I MIGHT
EVEN BECOME FRIENDS.

42:33.041 --> 42:36.041
PACEY...

42:36.041 --> 42:39.083
I'M UPSET ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

42:40.875 --> 42:42.500
COME HERE, POTTER.
