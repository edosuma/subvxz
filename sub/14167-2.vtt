21:37.004 --> 21:38.906
Why don't you grab those utensils...

21:38.940 --> 21:43.744
And eat up?

21:43.778 --> 21:46.279
Geez.

21:47.782 --> 21:51.918
[Sighs] That is some scar, huh?

21:51.953 --> 21:55.422
[Sighs, sniffs]

21:55.456 --> 21:58.091
Mm. You're a real monster, huh?

21:58.125 --> 22:00.093
Boy, look at this thing.

22:00.127 --> 22:02.628
Stop. Don't.

22:04.898 --> 22:07.533
I'm sorry about that.

22:07.568 --> 22:09.902
[Sighs]

22:15.476 --> 22:17.109
[Sniffs]

22:17.143 --> 22:19.460
So, you want to talk about
the guys who jumped you now?

22:21.825 --> 22:23.783
Meaning what?

22:23.817 --> 22:25.117
You know... what did they look like?

22:25.151 --> 22:27.325
What were they saying?
Were they talking shit?

22:29.665 --> 22:31.423
I don't remember.

22:31.458 --> 22:32.858
Well, they didn't steal anything,

22:32.892 --> 22:35.217
so they must have had
a reason to fuck you up.

22:36.550 --> 22:37.929
Jay.

22:37.964 --> 22:40.349
I left the gym.

22:40.386 --> 22:42.887
I woke up in the hospital.

22:45.023 --> 22:48.493
Can't tell you something I don't know.

22:48.527 --> 22:50.161
So it'd be really nice

22:50.195 --> 22:54.332
if you didn't pelt me
with fucking questions.

22:54.367 --> 22:57.334
You're right. I'm sorry.

22:57.369 --> 22:58.402
All right.

23:02.975 --> 23:04.608
So you want to, um...

23:04.643 --> 23:07.111
Maybe have some people over to the house?

23:07.146 --> 23:09.613
There's been some girls
asking about you, Nate.

23:09.648 --> 23:12.116
Want to spend some time with the champ.

23:12.151 --> 23:13.284
[Bottle opens]

23:13.318 --> 23:14.551
Kind of just want to chill.

23:14.586 --> 23:17.553
We can do that.

23:17.588 --> 23:20.556
We can chill today.

23:20.591 --> 23:23.393
But tomorrow, you're gonna come watch me

23:23.427 --> 23:26.897
kick the shit out of the old man.

23:26.931 --> 23:28.398
You guys training again?

23:28.432 --> 23:32.068
Yep. Of course, he's being an asshole.

23:32.103 --> 23:34.236
He's not getting any fucking fights, but...

23:34.271 --> 23:36.706
You haven't fought in a while, Jay.

23:38.676 --> 23:41.198
Yeah, but fuck that.

23:41.223 --> 23:44.682
Release the beast. Let him get paid.

23:45.849 --> 23:48.818
Right?

23:48.852 --> 23:50.986
Yeah.

23:51.021 --> 23:53.322
And then, they just, like,
put 20 grand on the table.

23:53.356 --> 23:55.324
- No, they did not.
- [Chuckling] They did.

23:55.358 --> 23:56.826
Jesus Christ. You got to run.

23:56.860 --> 23:59.328
- I know. I know.
- Run.

23:59.362 --> 24:02.998
It felt really good to have
20 grand in my hands, though.

24:03.033 --> 24:04.700
Yeah.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.535
This investor thing's not for us,

24:06.569 --> 24:08.203
you know, even if their money's legit.

24:08.237 --> 24:10.038
- Well...
- And they get control,

24:10.072 --> 24:11.707
and they're in our lives,
and we don't need that shit.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.041
That's not for us.

24:13.075 --> 24:15.310
Fine, but we need something.

24:15.345 --> 24:18.980
I'm telling you we should
give this Ryan thing a go.

24:19.014 --> 24:20.816
[Exhales sharply]

24:20.850 --> 24:22.350
He's not gonna fight.

24:22.384 --> 24:25.353
[Scoffs] You keep saying that.

24:25.387 --> 24:28.356
How do you know?

24:32.294 --> 24:34.462
I went to see him.

24:39.868 --> 24:42.391
He was texting me and...

24:44.373 --> 24:48.509
He was saying something about the 12 steps

24:48.543 --> 24:51.345
and making amends and apologizing,

24:51.380 --> 24:54.849
and there was a whole bunch
of other people there...

24:54.883 --> 24:58.852
all of these families... and he apologized.

24:58.887 --> 25:04.202
Honestly, Alvey, I felt...Awful for him.

25:06.290 --> 25:10.030
He doesn't have any family.
He doesn't have anybody.

25:15.002 --> 25:18.004
[Sighs]

25:23.076 --> 25:26.045
- He's got us.
- Alvey, no.

25:26.079 --> 25:27.747
I mean, you think I like him texting you?

25:27.782 --> 25:28.881
That's... that's gonna stop.

25:28.916 --> 25:31.550
But I kind of understand it, you know?

25:31.584 --> 25:33.386
I do.

25:33.420 --> 25:35.388
I empathize with him. I
mean, he's a desperate guy.

25:35.422 --> 25:37.223
- I-I've been there.
- Okay, fine.

25:37.257 --> 25:39.358
Whatever it is, I don't
want him in our life,

25:39.393 --> 25:40.993
and I don't want him in our gym.

25:41.028 --> 25:42.861
I know, but that's two separate things.

25:42.896 --> 25:46.197
- No, they're not, Alvey.
- Yes, it is.

25:46.232 --> 25:47.365
Oh, my God.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.901
Come on.

25:50.770 --> 25:52.738
Look.

25:52.772 --> 25:55.741
At least keep an open mind, right?

25:55.775 --> 25:57.576
We cut out all the fuck-ups in our lives,

25:57.610 --> 25:59.778
- there'd be nobody left.
- Mm.

26:07.959 --> 26:09.593
Come on, Jay! Do something!

26:09.628 --> 26:10.761
Jay: I'm standing up, pops.

26:10.795 --> 26:12.196
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

26:12.230 --> 26:14.031
Aah!

26:14.065 --> 26:15.932
Come on. Put me down, bitch. Come on.

26:15.967 --> 26:18.769
Come on, hips, hips, motherfucker!

26:18.803 --> 26:21.271
Come on!

26:21.305 --> 26:22.605
Hips, man.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.575
Hips, hips. Come on.

26:25.609 --> 26:27.577
Jesus Christ, you're fucking weak!

26:27.611 --> 26:30.013
Where did you go?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.651
Oh! That's all you got?

26:35.319 --> 26:36.419
[Both grunting]

26:40.123 --> 26:41.457
[Spectators murmuring]

26:41.492 --> 26:43.459
[Groans] You fucking kicked me, man.

26:43.494 --> 26:44.727
You kicked me.

26:44.761 --> 26:47.063
That's what you do? Get
a fucking cheap shot?

26:47.097 --> 26:48.864
[Punches gloves] Come on.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.966
Come on. Come on. Throw kicks.

26:51.001 --> 26:53.102
Throw kicks.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.470
Aah!

26:55.505 --> 26:57.907
- Ohh!
- Again? Again?

26:58.742 --> 27:01.744
You gonna fucking kick me?
You got no fucking length.

27:01.778 --> 27:04.413
You got no snap in your fucking punches.

27:04.447 --> 27:06.048
Man: Jay, fight back.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.549
- Get the fuck...
- [Grunts]

27:07.584 --> 27:11.119
Motherfucker, you want to kick?

27:11.153 --> 27:12.287
You kick me?

27:14.023 --> 27:16.325
Only fighters in here, only fighters.

27:16.359 --> 27:17.826
[Sighs]

27:17.860 --> 27:19.695
There you go.

27:21.364 --> 27:22.664
You got blood on my gloves.

27:22.699 --> 27:25.666
I want some fights.

27:25.701 --> 27:26.768
What did you say?

27:26.802 --> 27:29.437
[Sighs]

27:29.471 --> 27:31.339
I want some fights.

27:31.373 --> 27:33.407
Who's getting you fights?

27:33.442 --> 27:34.909
I don't know. Isn't that
what you do around here?

27:34.944 --> 27:36.677
Yeah, that's what I do.

27:36.712 --> 27:38.847
I ain't picking up the
phone for you again, man.

27:38.881 --> 27:41.515
You're here 'cause your brother
wants you here. You know that.

27:41.550 --> 27:42.683
Okay.

27:42.718 --> 27:45.353
Thanks for looking out, pops.

27:45.387 --> 27:47.087
Looking out?

27:47.122 --> 27:49.156
I got promoters that still won't
call me back because of you.

27:49.190 --> 27:50.824
You either don't show up
or you don't make weight,

27:50.859 --> 27:52.326
or you show up and you're drunk.

27:52.361 --> 27:53.661
Yeah, and I win the fight.

27:53.695 --> 27:56.497
And it's the fight of the
night, and it's a fucking show.

27:56.531 --> 27:58.331
You're a dickhead, and
that's dickhead behavior,

27:58.366 --> 28:01.168
and you're un-fucking-reliable.

28:01.202 --> 28:02.569
That makes me unreliable,

28:02.603 --> 28:04.972
and I can't get these guys fucking fights.

28:05.006 --> 28:07.808
They leave my gym.

28:07.842 --> 28:10.144
Just stop fucking thinking
about yourself all the time.

28:17.518 --> 28:18.985
Why do you want to fight?

28:19.019 --> 28:21.488
[Sighs]

28:21.522 --> 28:24.223
'Cause I have the heart of a lion.

28:24.258 --> 28:27.193
You need money.

28:31.698 --> 28:32.999
I need a fight.

28:33.033 --> 28:35.168
Show me some fucking consistency.

28:35.202 --> 28:37.003
Show me some fucking heart.

28:37.037 --> 28:39.505
Do that for me.

28:39.539 --> 28:41.507
Okay?

28:41.541 --> 28:44.677
Yeah?

28:44.711 --> 28:47.012
I'm not done.

28:47.046 --> 28:48.847
I want you to do me a favor.

28:48.881 --> 28:50.416
I want you to tone things down, okay?

28:50.450 --> 28:52.718
- It's toned down.
- I want you to tone things down

28:52.752 --> 28:54.219
because I want your brother to rest, okay?

28:54.253 --> 28:56.722
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:56.756 --> 28:58.657
You talk to the police?

28:58.692 --> 29:00.492
No, not lately.

29:00.527 --> 29:02.661
'Cause, you know, they're
not answering my phone calls.

29:02.696 --> 29:04.229
I'm up their ass. Don't call them.

29:04.263 --> 29:05.730
- Don't call them.
- Think they'd do their fucking job.

29:05.764 --> 29:07.398
- Don't call them, Jay.
- All right.

29:07.433 --> 29:10.735
All right? They'll call me
when they know something.

29:10.769 --> 29:12.403
Throw that away.

29:12.438 --> 29:14.706
What is this? Your house? Throw it away!

29:14.740 --> 29:16.374
Jay, I'm not kidding.

29:18.444 --> 29:20.411
You gonna give me a fight?

29:20.446 --> 29:22.246
Get out. Get out.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.781
Get out.

29:26.585 --> 29:29.086
[Engine revving]

29:33.925 --> 29:35.226
Ryan Wheeler.

29:35.260 --> 29:36.593
[P.A. Beeps]

29:36.627 --> 29:39.096
Woman: Ryan Wheeler,
please come to reception.

29:39.130 --> 29:43.433
Ryan Wheeler, to reception.

29:43.468 --> 29:45.202
Ryan: I mean, there was basketball.

29:45.237 --> 29:47.771
But then there was a fight,
so they hid the ball on us.

29:47.805 --> 29:50.440
And then, uh, there's ping-pong,

29:50.475 --> 29:53.877
but somebody broke one
of the paddles, so...

29:53.911 --> 29:55.211
You only had two paddles?

29:55.246 --> 29:56.713
- Yo, that's it. N-no doubles.
- [Chuckles]

29:56.748 --> 29:58.382
Unless you're on the same team.

29:58.416 --> 29:59.549
That's fucking depressing.

29:59.584 --> 30:01.418
No, it's actually not that bad.

30:01.452 --> 30:03.086
It's not that good.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.454
It's not that good, no.

30:04.489 --> 30:06.623
Oh, I wanted to show you... fuck!

30:06.657 --> 30:08.458
[Both laugh]

30:08.493 --> 30:11.294
[Dogs barking in distance]

30:11.328 --> 30:13.129
How come you haven't
come down to the gym, man?

30:13.163 --> 30:15.798
It's been a couple weeks.

30:15.832 --> 30:18.301
Busy. [Scoffs]

30:18.335 --> 30:21.137
It's not you, Ryan.

30:21.171 --> 30:24.140
This place is not for you.

30:24.174 --> 30:25.908
See...

30:25.942 --> 30:28.076
Every day we, uh... [Clears throat]

30:28.111 --> 30:29.412
We have these group sessions.

30:29.446 --> 30:32.080
We go in the big room.
We sit in a big circle.

30:32.115 --> 30:36.919
Guys talk about their lives,
how they fucked 'em up...

30:36.953 --> 30:38.320
[Laughs]

30:38.354 --> 30:39.822
Things you wouldn't believe,

30:39.856 --> 30:44.159
like some of the most depressing
shit I have ever heard.

30:44.193 --> 30:46.494
And I'm, like, looking around
at the circle, going, like,

30:46.529 --> 30:50.165
"what a bunch of fucking degenerates."

30:50.199 --> 30:51.499
And then I'm right there
in the middle of it.

30:51.534 --> 30:53.768
- Ah.
- Like, I'm in that circle.

30:53.803 --> 30:55.437
- Like, that's me.
- That's not you.

30:55.471 --> 30:56.438
- Yeah.
- It's not, man.

30:56.472 --> 30:59.441
I appreciate what you're saying.

30:59.475 --> 31:02.343
You're not like the rest of
these fucking mutts, though.

31:02.377 --> 31:04.378
But...I'm here.

31:06.380 --> 31:07.681
You know, let's... let's forget about

31:07.715 --> 31:08.949
the recovery bullshit for a second.

31:08.983 --> 31:09.950
[Chuckling] Okay.

31:09.984 --> 31:11.284
Maybe it's not fair,

31:11.319 --> 31:14.655
but sometimes God gives some
men just a little bit more.

31:17.058 --> 31:21.194
It's okay to be exceptional. It is.

31:21.228 --> 31:24.697
You hide from that, that's the fucking sin.

31:24.731 --> 31:26.532
You got a talent that nobody else has.

31:26.567 --> 31:30.203
Why the fuck you want to
be like everybody else?

31:30.237 --> 31:32.705
Eh... I just want to be normal.

31:32.739 --> 31:36.042
Normal?

31:36.077 --> 31:37.795
He wants to be normal!

31:39.079 --> 31:40.348
You're not fucking normal.

31:46.620 --> 31:48.420
I got a plan for you.

31:48.455 --> 31:50.923
We bring you along nice and slow.

31:50.958 --> 31:52.424
We don't... we don't even...

31:52.459 --> 31:53.926
we don't even talk about a fight

31:53.961 --> 31:55.927
until you are rock solid on every level.

31:55.962 --> 31:59.431
No. No. Nope.

31:59.466 --> 32:01.400
I can't get back to where I was.

32:01.434 --> 32:02.701
I'm not that animal.

32:02.735 --> 32:03.702
Yes, you can. You are that animal.

32:03.736 --> 32:05.004
Of course you're that animal.

32:05.038 --> 32:07.473
We throw a steak in front of
the cave, you come right back.

32:07.507 --> 32:09.541
Look, Alvey, I'm really
sorry to disappoint you,

32:09.575 --> 32:13.044
but... It's not in me anymore.

32:13.078 --> 32:15.380
