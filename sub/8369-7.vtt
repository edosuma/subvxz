all the way back --

00:26.794 --> 00:28.293
To get another chance.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.296
James: I know you. You're one of
those rich computer twins.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.132
Otto re-coded
your white blood cells

00:33.134 --> 00:34.533
To fight the cancer
in my blood.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.736
You brought me back
to save you.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.438
Otto: He's stronger than
predicted

00:43.143 --> 00:45.644
Why does he think
he's my father?

00:45.646 --> 00:48.213
Because he is.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.482
I have more than six months
to live now.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.085
I don't want to prepare
for my end anymore.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.154
I need to
call off the merger.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.156
Now that the merger's off,

00:57.158 --> 01:01.994
I need you to get me
otto's lab work and notes.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.662
If I can't have otto,
I need his work.

Mm.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.962
[ sighs ]

01:36.964 --> 01:40.299
It smells like there was
drinking involved, as well.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.200
Why are you here?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.102
I'm dropping off
paperwork for mary.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.770
I'll help you
to your room.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.372
Ooh.
But I barely know you.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.874
Here we go.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.442
You're very strong.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.277
I'm fine.
I'm strong, you know?

01:52.279 --> 01:53.479
All right.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.124
Ignore him.
He's not real.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.559
-Okay.
-He's a computer, you know?

02:08.728 --> 02:10.395
Okay.
[ groans ]

02:10.397 --> 02:12.131
All right.
Here you go.

Yep.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.837
Pipe down, arthur.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.973
She's just helping out
an old man.

[ beeps ]

03:13.126 --> 03:16.295
â™ª

03:16.297 --> 03:17.896
I want you to be nice.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.231
Why wouldn't I be nice?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.466
Because helen
is bringing a man.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.301
A man?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.802
Mm-hmm.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.705
I always thought
she was a, uh...

03:26.707 --> 03:28.807
I just never --
I've never seen her with a man.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.309
Do you not remember
what you did

03:30.311 --> 03:32.711
To every boy she brought around
the house growing up?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.314
If they just left running,
we called that the pritchard.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.715
If they left
running and crying,

03:36.717 --> 03:38.083
Then they got
the full sheriff.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.484
That was
for her own good.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.320
Those high-school boys
were all bad news.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.422
Well, this is one
of those high-school boys,

03:43.424 --> 03:45.090
So I'm warning you --
just be nice.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.658
Which one?

03:46.660 --> 03:49.094
Wally luskin.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.162
Wally the weasel?!

03:50.164 --> 03:53.498
He dealt weed and --
and he drove a molester van.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.267
I bet he got
the full sheriff.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.336
Look, she hadn't seen him
in years.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.838
They ran into each other
a few months ago,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.273
And they hit it off.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.342
She says
that wally has changed.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.745
She needs this to work.
Do you understand?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.847
Uh, duval,
you remember wally.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.515
I do.
Been a long time.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.917
It has.
Good to see you.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.620
And this is my other brother,
jimmy, I told you about.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.588
Jimmy.
Just like your dad.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.791
I mean, the -- the name,
not -- not that other way.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.927
What other way?

04:21.929 --> 04:24.529
Why don't we order
some drinks.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.530
Can we --

04:25.532 --> 04:27.866
So, wally,

04:27.868 --> 04:28.867
What do you do?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.602
Wally is
in law enforcement.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.371
I'm a parole officer.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.939
Parole officer?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.375
A p.O. Uh, that's
not law enforcement.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.376
Duval:
[ clears throat ]

04:37.378 --> 04:38.710
It's a very valuable
service

04:38.712 --> 04:40.112
To the recently
incarcerated.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.280
That's
what I told him.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.814
You know,
wally gets down on himself,

04:42.816 --> 04:44.149
But he helps people
who need it.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.717
[ chuckles ]

04:50.556 --> 04:54.159
[ chuckles ] and -- and helen
ran all the way home.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.560
She did.
[ chuckles ]

04:55.562 --> 04:59.064
So, we all went around,
and we got her some wine.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.133
You okay, wally?

05:01.135 --> 05:03.235
Yeah. Everything's great.
Thanks.

05:03.237 --> 05:06.371
It's the best egg foo yung
in the city. You're not hungry?

05:10.576 --> 05:12.077
Duval, come
to the bar with me.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.745
Let's get
another round, huh?

05:13.747 --> 05:16.081
Anybody want a drink?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.482
Wally:
Um, just a beer.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.084
Helen:
Yes, a beer. Thanks.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.087
I think
it's going really well.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.258
A parole officer?
That's not law enforcement.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.193
You think she'd know
better than that.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.328
Why are we up here?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.829
The waiter could have
gotten more drinks.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.497
He won't look me in the eye.
You notice that?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.266
Only people with something
to hide do that.

05:34.268 --> 05:37.235
Leave it alone.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.844
[ thunder rumbles ]

05:45.846 --> 05:48.113
[ sighs ]
wally the weasel.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.018
You run a guy off, and as soon
as you're a little bit dead,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.886
He thinks he can
crawl right back in.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.521
[ beeps ]
aah!

05:56.523 --> 05:58.557
Arthur, don't do that.

<i>Are you lost?</i>

06:01.295 --> 06:04.129
I'm following this guy
in the car down the block.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.365
Helen and duval
thinks he's changed,

06:06.367 --> 06:08.533
But he's up to something.
I saw it.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.112
Who's this guy?

06:23.249 --> 06:25.550
Arthur, can we listen in
on that car over there?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.652
<i>My technology is</i>

06:39.066 --> 06:41.333

06:41.335 --> 06:43.335

when you weren't.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.103

getting paid for it.

moping for, huh?

06:49.443 --> 06:51.243
You got it
the easiest in this.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.112
You sign your name, and
the money goes in your account.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.681
Two more days
and you're done.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.084
Now, you gonna
sign my card?

I can't use it in court.

to alibi an ex-con.

He's taking money to say he was
with someone when he wasn't.

Did you bring that list of
wally's parolees like I asked?

Assault, assault with
a deadly weapon, armed robbery.

This guy runs crews.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.680
Look, he did
the casino heist in reno.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.248
He did the jewelry store
in redmond.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.250
He's setting up a crew
right now.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.318

08:09.088 --> 08:10.989
I'll break it to helen.

I'll let you know

I can tell her.

huh?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.931
Is it weird
that she lives here?

08:19.933 --> 08:23.168
Not as weird as your living
in the fake version of it

In mary goodwin's
basement.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.606
What's the dvd?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.774
"the notebook."
she likes it.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.177
I'm using it
to clean up your mess.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.281
I didn't break my oath
as a law-enforcement officer.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.549
Lately.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.684
Hi.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.852
Hey, there.

08:44.957 --> 08:48.293
[ sighs ] didn't want to leave
any trace of the old man, huh?

08:48.295 --> 08:49.794
Oh, just the opposite.

08:49.796 --> 08:54.299
I actually moved here
to, uh, feel closer to him.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.135
I think he'd love what I've done
with the place, don't you?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.804
Yeah. I mean, he was
always asking me

08:59.806 --> 09:02.040
To bring him
more...Crystals.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.976
So, what is
the big announcement?

09:04.978 --> 09:07.712
I can't stand
the anticipation.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.715
Well, helen,
it's like this.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.052
In life, there are
two kinds of people.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.388
Wait a minute.
Is that "the notebook"?

09:17.590 --> 09:19.591
Oh, my god.
What happened?

09:19.593 --> 09:21.326
What's wrong?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.428
Well, it's wally...

09:23.430 --> 09:25.931
And, uh,
he's on the take.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.432
What?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.100
That's how you tell her?

Yeah, I mean,
band-aid, zip, done.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.338

09:33.340 --> 09:35.640
Say it isn't true.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.677
How do you know?

09:38.679 --> 09:41.279
Well, I followed him.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.348
And why would
you do that?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.083
Why?
He didn't seem right.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.185
Were you looking
for something to get him for?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.587
He is breaking the law.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.592
Yeah, wow.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.694
I thought this was it.

09:55.696 --> 10:00.532
I...I thought wally and I
had found each other.
