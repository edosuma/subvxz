WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:06.729
This is...
...to the USS Voyager.

00:06.806 --> 00:09.240
lf you are receiving
this message...

00:09.309 --> 00:11.243
please...it carefully.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.040
We have...

00:14.514 --> 00:18.143
This is Starfleet...

00:18.218 --> 00:21.381
...receiving this message...

00:24.691 --> 00:27.626
This is Starfleet Command...

00:30.563 --> 00:33.498
...this message, study...
carefully.

00:33.566 --> 00:35.431
We have...

00:35.502 --> 00:36.833
What happened?

00:36.903 --> 00:37.835
l'm not sure.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.895
The transmission just...
stopped.

00:39.973 --> 00:40.940
Locate the source.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.235
See if you can get it back.

00:42.308 --> 00:44.139
lt looks like...

00:44.210 --> 00:46.872
Captain,
the transmission was sent

00:46.946 --> 00:48.811
along the same network
of alien relay stations

00:48.882 --> 00:51.009
we used to send the Doctor
to the Alpha Quadrant.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.609
Starfleet Command must be
using them just like we did.

00:53.686 --> 00:55.347
Harry, can you clear
the interference

00:55.422 --> 00:56.354
from that message?

00:56.423 --> 00:57.651
Yes, ma'am.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.656
They said they wouldn't stop

00:58.725 --> 00:59.953
until they found
a way to get us home.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.187
Nonetheless, we can't assume
they've been able

01:02.262 --> 01:03.422
to devise a plan this quickly.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.464
They're communicating with us.

01:05.532 --> 01:06.760
That's a big step.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.801
Okay, l've reprocessed
everything we received.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.563
l've cleared out
most of the interference.

01:10.637 --> 01:11.661
Here it is.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.640
This is Starfleet Command
to the USS Voyager.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.972
lf you are receiving
this message,

01:18.044 --> 01:20.274
please study it carefully.

01:20.346 --> 01:21.813
We have information...

01:21.881 --> 01:24.406
That's all we got.

01:24.484 --> 01:25.849
lt looks like the bulk
of the transmission

01:25.919 --> 01:27.409
is lodged in one
of the relay stations.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.715
Can you tell which one?

01:28.788 --> 01:31.655
lt's about 3. 8
light- years from us

01:31.724 --> 01:34.887
on a heading of 27 4 mark 13.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.155
Set a course, Tom.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.821
Last time we used one
of those stations,

01:37.897 --> 01:39.421
the people who built
it weren't too happy.

01:39.499 --> 01:40.431
We'll deal with that
if we have to,

01:40.500 --> 01:42.365
but l'm not going to lose
this opportunity.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.427
We're going to find out what
the rest of that message says.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.801
This is...Command
to the USS Voyager.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.138
lf you are

01:51.211 --> 01:54.442
receiving this message,
please study it carefully...

01:54.514 --> 01:56.573
Who sent this message?

01:56.649 --> 01:58.708
Unknown.
lt comes from across the galaxy.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.980
Locate the ship receiving it.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.749
lt's on a course
to one of our modules.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.380
lntercept.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.477 --> 04:06.809
Maybe they've figured out
a way to get us home.

04:06.879 --> 04:09.871
How could they get us home
from 60, 000 light- years away?

04:09.949 --> 04:11.814
Who knows
what technological advances

04:11.884 --> 04:14.409
Starfleet has come up with
since we've been gone?

04:14.487 --> 04:15.476
They might have developed

04:15.555 --> 04:17.317
a whole new way
of traveling through space.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.551
Since it was technology
that brought us

04:19.625 --> 04:21.491
to the Delta Quadrant
in the first place,

04:21.560 --> 04:23.256
it's a reasonable assumption

04:23.329 --> 04:25.524
technology
could bring us back again.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.587
Starfleet found
a stable wormhole

04:26.666 --> 04:27.598
to the Gamma Quadrant.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.726
Maybe they've discovered
one that leads here.

04:29.802 --> 04:32.771
This kind of speculation can be
intriguing, but be careful

04:32.839 --> 04:35.273
about setting yourselves up
to be disappointed.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.310
l'm just happy my folks
know l'm alive.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.744
l imagine there were
quite a few celebrations

04:40.813 --> 04:42.474
when people got the news.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.982
Probably, but l can see

04:45.051 --> 04:47.519
where it might make things
more difficult for some.

04:47.587 --> 04:50.283
l'd guess a lot of people
had given up on us--

04:50.356 --> 04:52.950
done their mourning,
gone on with their lives--

04:53.026 --> 04:54.516
found some kind of resolution.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.391
Now they get word
that we're alive,

04:56.462 --> 04:59.192
but so far away that we
might as well be dead.

04:59.265 --> 05:03.793
Some people might feel that way,
but not my mom and dad.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.498
At the very least, we know
the relay stations extend

05:06.572 --> 05:08.437
almost all the way
to the Alpha Quadrant.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.568
lf Starfleet has found a way to
use them to transmit messages,

05:11.644 --> 05:13.908
we'll be able to stay
in constant contact

05:13.980 --> 05:15.072
with people at home.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.479
That has to be comforting.

05:16.549 --> 05:19.177
Sure it is, but l think
it's more comforting

05:19.252 --> 05:21.743
to think that Starfleet
is going to get us home.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.119
lf no one objects, that's
what l'm going to do.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.119
You were supposed to report

05:29.195 --> 05:31.220
to Sick Bay this morning
for your weekly checkup.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.390
Where have you been?

05:33.466 --> 05:34.433
Here, doing my job.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.627
And just what is
this pressing task?

05:36.703 --> 05:38.534
l'm trying to retrieve
more of the message

05:38.604 --> 05:40.572
transmitted
from Starfleet Command.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.767
Hmm. Your devotion
to duty is admirable,

05:42.842 --> 05:44.366
but you must remember
that your implants

05:44.444 --> 05:45.934
have to be monitored
regularly.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.376
l'm fine.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.607
No, you're not.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.115
l'm detecting reduced levels
of erythrocytes in your blood.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.913
How long has it been
since you regenerated?

05:52.985 --> 05:53.508
58 hours.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.144
Well, that explains it.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.280
We've discussed this before,
Seven.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.756
You must regenerate
in your alcove

05:58.825 --> 06:00.383
for at least three hours a day.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.087
l have gone
as long as 200 hours

06:02.161 --> 06:03.219
without regenerating.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.524
That was when you were a Borg.

06:04.597 --> 06:07.327
You seem to forget you're
a good deal more human now.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.664
l assure you,
l have not forgotten.

06:10.970 --> 06:11.868
Another one.

06:11.971 --> 06:12.960
l beg your pardon?

06:13.039 --> 06:15.599
l've retrieved
another word of text.

06:15.675 --> 06:16.767
That makes six.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.869
Six words in 58 hours?

06:19.946 --> 06:21.470
Wouldn't it be
more efficient just to wait

06:21.547 --> 06:23.276
until we arrive
at the relay station?

06:23.349 --> 06:26.341
This message is important
to the Captain.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.545
l'm aware of that.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.885
ln fact, if it weren't
for me, this transmission

06:30.957 --> 06:32.788
wouldn't have been possible
in the first place.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.918
l was the one
who risked my matrix

06:34.994 --> 06:36.928
in order to go
to the Alpha Quadrant.

06:36.996 --> 06:39.123
lf we ever get home,

06:39.198 --> 06:43.066
l expect l'll become
quite the hero.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.604
"Emergency Medical Hologram
instrumental

06:45.671 --> 06:47.696
in the return of Voyager crew."

06:47.774 --> 06:49.935
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

06:50.042 --> 06:51.669
On the other hand,
it is entirely possible

06:51.744 --> 06:52.938
that your program
will be deleted

06:53.012 --> 06:54.377
and you'll be upgraded
to conform

06:54.447 --> 06:56.210
to the most recent standards.

06:56.282 --> 06:57.840
Unlikely.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.354
l've accomplished things
no EMH ever has.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.186
ln fact, most likely
l'll become

07:05.258 --> 07:08.489
an object of intense
study and discussion--

07:08.561 --> 07:09.391
possibly even veneration.

07:10.897 --> 07:11.955
What's that?

07:12.031 --> 07:13.521
Report.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.328
We're encountering some kind
of gravimetric forces.

07:15.401 --> 07:16.425
Source?

07:18.671 --> 07:19.763
Looks like it's coming

07:19.839 --> 07:21.704
from the relay station
we're heading for.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.038
That station is still
two light- years away.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.408
How could it project
a gravimetric field this far?

07:26.479 --> 07:27.411
lt would have to have

07:27.480 --> 07:28.913
an incredibly powerful
energy source.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.643
l've compensated
for the disturbance.

07:31.717 --> 07:33.150
We should be all right--

07:33.219 --> 07:34.186
at least until we get closer.

07:34.253 --> 07:35.880
l'm detecting a ship, Captain.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.287
800, 000 kilometers
off the port bow.

07:38.357 --> 07:39.722
On screen.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.316
lt's adrift.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.727
No propulsion systems,
no weapons, no life support.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.322
l'm picking up
one male humanoid aboard.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.731
He's dead.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.934
As soon as we're close enough,
beam the body to Sick Bay.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.804
l want to know how he died.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.243
What's happened to him?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.046
He appears to have suffered
a complete osteotomy.

08:06.118 --> 08:07.483
He's been gutted.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.578
Apparently, some kind of
surgical procedure was used

08:09.655 --> 08:11.350
to remove the entire skeleton,

08:11.424 --> 08:13.688
as well as the musculature,
the ligaments and tendons,

08:13.759 --> 08:15.021
and the internal organs.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.721
How long ago did this happen?

08:16.796 --> 08:17.854
lt's difficult to say.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.364
Somewhere between
a week and a month.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.991
l've seen this before.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.502
The Borg encountered
a small ship of Species 517 4.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.765
They were also destroyed
in this fashion.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.807
Did you ever determine
who did it and why?

08:28.875 --> 08:30.274
No, it was irrelevant.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.710
Return the body to his ship.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.440
His people may be able
to retrieve him.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.846
Very well.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.383
When we get closer
to the station,

08:38.451 --> 08:41.010
we can use the data processors
in Astrometrics

08:41.087 --> 08:42.520
to download the message.

08:42.587 --> 08:43.554
Yes, Captain.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.856
Captain's Log, Stardate 51501. 4.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.591
After two days at high warp,

08:52.665 --> 08:54.257
we're close enough
to the relay station

08:54.333 --> 08:56.927
to see it on long- range
visual sensors.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.494
Not exactly what l expected.

08:59.572 --> 09:00.470
lt looks ancient.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.302
Radiometric decay ratios
indicate

09:02.341 --> 09:04.809
it's at least 100, 000 years old.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.536
Scan for life- forms.

09:06.612 --> 09:07.738
Negative, sir.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.337
Looks like there's nobody home.

09:09.415 --> 09:10.848
Well, that's good news.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.077
Here we go again.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.211
The gravimetric field.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.949
Commander, if my sensors

09:17.023 --> 09:18.854
are right,
that station is using

09:18.958 --> 09:21.085
a quantum singularity
as a power source.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.252
A black hole?

09:22.328 --> 09:25.092
lt's a tiny one, probably
about a centimeter in diameter,

09:25.164 --> 09:27.962
but it's putting out almost
four terawatts of energy.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.502
Then someone has managed
to contain a singularity,

09:30.570 --> 09:33.505
construct a space station
around it and tap its power.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.165
That's fascinating.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.799
Can we take this ship
any closer?

09:36.876 --> 09:38.207
l wouldn't recommend it.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.336
Voyager would take a beating
from the gravimetric eddies.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.675
All right, Tom, back us off.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.679
Aye, sir.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.737
Bridge to Janeway.

09:43.816 --> 09:44.748
Go ahead.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.650
We're as close as we're
going to be able to get.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.813
Okay. We'll see if we can
download the message from here.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.255
The datastream degraded
during transmission.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.759
Elements have been
dislocated, rearranged.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.557
lt's going to require some time
to decompress the message

09:57.630 --> 09:58.824
and rearrange it
in the proper sequence.

09:58.898 --> 09:59.887
Don't worry about the sequence.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.524
Get it out in bits and pieces
if you have to.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.659
We can put it together later.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.362
l've accessed a block of data.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.598
l'm downloading the text.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.578
"How much we miss you...

10:14.180 --> 10:15.977
"We talk about you often...

10:16.048 --> 10:20.246
wondering about your...day."

10:20.319 --> 10:22.617
lt sounds awfully personal
from Starfleet Command.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.951
"The children have grown
so much you wouldn't..."

10:34.433 --> 10:35.832
These are letters.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.464
These are letters from home.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.515
You'll be the official
mail carrier, Neelix.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.515
We'll get you the letters

10:51.584 --> 10:52.949
as quickly as we
can download them.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.453
A task l'm happy
to perform, Captain.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.581
l can tell you, l've never
seen the crew this excited.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.125
This is as close
as they've come

11:00.192 --> 11:02.160
to their families
in almost four years.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.696
l promise to treat these
like gemstones.

11:04.764 --> 11:05.788
By the time you've
delivered them,

11:05.865 --> 11:06.832
we should have more.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.724
Captain.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.429
l've discovered something odd.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.938
There seems to be more
here than just letters.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.064
What do you mean?

11:15.141 --> 11:17.974
There's a latent datastream
buried under the message.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.203
lt's heavily encrypted.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.540
Encrypted?

11:20.613 --> 11:21.739
lt appears to contain

11:21.814 --> 11:24.248
a large block of text
and what may be maps.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.307
Can you retrieve any of it?

11:26.385 --> 11:27.477
Not immediately.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.111
When more of the letters
have been cleared out,

11:29.188 --> 11:31.281
l should be able to access
the coded message.

11:35.127 --> 11:40.656
Well...l might just hope
that it contains a plan

11:40.733 --> 11:43.497
for bringing us back
to the Alpha Quadrant.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.838
l'm curious, Seven.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.203
What do you think
about all this?

11:48.274 --> 11:49.832
Messages, the possibility
of getting home?

11:49.909 --> 11:53.345
lt lacks any emotional
resonance for me.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.845
l've never even been to Earth.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.510
You realize
you may have family there.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.551
That had not occurred to me.

12:02.621 --> 12:05.454
You could have cousins,
grandparents...

12:07.293 --> 12:10.194
There might be more emotional
resonance than you think.

12:18.437 --> 12:20.496
l am happy to announce

12:20.573 --> 12:23.371
that l have the first
letters from home.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.602
Who are they for, Neelix?

12:24.677 --> 12:27.976
Uh, this one is addressed
to Commander Chakotay.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.147
Who's it from, Commander?

12:34.220 --> 12:36.882
An old friend...

12:36.956 --> 12:38.821
the person who recruited
me into the Maquis.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.157
Maybe l'll read this
in private.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.892
Tom, you have the Bridge.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.292
Neelix, wait a minute.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.997
Aren't there any more?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.663
No. No more
for the Bridge crew.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.765
Not yet.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.867
Be patient.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.214
Come in.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.147
Good news, Mr. Vulcan.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.741
This one's for you.

13:06.819 --> 13:07.877
Thank you, Mr. Neelix.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.284
You can put it on the desk.

13:14.393 --> 13:15.860
Was there something more?

13:15.928 --> 13:18.226
Aren't you going to read it?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.288
Of course.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.597
l- l mean, aren't you
going to read it now?

13:23.669 --> 13:25.830
l'm finishing my weekly
tactical review.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.873
When it's completed
l'll read the message.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.100
You're going to wait

13:29.175 --> 13:31.666
until you've finished
the tactical review?

13:31.744 --> 13:33.712
Do you have
any reason to believe

13:33.779 --> 13:36.646
the content of the message
will change during that time?

13:36.715 --> 13:37.875
Well, that's not the point.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.349
lt's a letter from your family.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.181
Don't you want to know
what it says?

13:41.253 --> 13:43.483
l fully intend to find out
what it says.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.489
lt has some important news.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.958
You mean you've read it?

13:50.029 --> 13:52.862
Well, only the first few lines.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.365
When l was seeing
who it was addressed to,

13:54.433 --> 13:57.231
l...l couldn't help it.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.930
l- l...would you like me
to read it to you?

14:00.206 --> 14:01.400
Very well.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.645
"My husband, we have
been given the news

14:07.713 --> 14:09.146
"that you are alive.

14:09.215 --> 14:10.239
"Your children and l

14:10.316 --> 14:12.477
"have asked the priests
at the Temple of Aymonk

14:12.551 --> 14:14.917
to say prayers
for your safe return."

14:14.987 --> 14:15.851
That's very sweet.

14:15.921 --> 14:16.853
Amonak.

14:16.922 --> 14:17.854
Pardon?

14:17.923 --> 14:19.447
The Temple of Amonak--

14:19.525 --> 14:21.550
one of the most sacred
on Vulcan.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.458
Amonak. Of course.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.087
"The most significant news

14:25.164 --> 14:27.257
"is the fact
that your first son, Sek,

14:27.333 --> 14:28.891
"has gone through the Pon farr.

14:28.968 --> 14:31.027
"He mated and has
become a father.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.833
"You are now the grandfather
of a healthy female

14:33.906 --> 14:36.500
who they have named T'Meni,
after your mother."

14:36.575 --> 14:38.975
You're a grandfather!

14:39.078 --> 14:40.340
lsn't that wonderful?

14:40.412 --> 14:41.970
Congratulations!

14:42.047 --> 14:43.605
What should we call you now?

14:43.682 --> 14:45.650
Grandpa? Gramps?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.709
l think Commander Tuvok
will suffice.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.447
Thank you, Mr. Neelix.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.921
l'll read the rest to myself.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.788
Just as long as you
read it right away.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.451
No procrastinating.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.688
Who knows what else
might be in that letter?

15:29.194 --> 15:31.025
ls that a letter to you,
Captain?

15:31.096 --> 15:34.395
Yes. Seven just downloaded it.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.457
l'll be in my ready room.

15:36.535 --> 15:37.832
Yes, ma'am.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.422
Have you gotten a letter yet?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.361
Don't expect one.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.468
Do you remember Sveta?

16:44.937 --> 16:46.268
Of course.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.272
l got one from her.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.365
Why would she be writing you?

17:00.119 --> 17:01.746
Chakotay, what is it?

17:04.623 --> 17:07.090
Something terrible has happened.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.992
l read that letter for an hour
before l could accept it.

17:10.061 --> 17:12.326
Now l have to tell
everyone else...

17:12.397 --> 17:14.059
and l'm not sure how to do it.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.503
lt's over, B'Elanna.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.597
There are no more Maquis.

17:25.010 --> 17:25.907
What are you saying?

17:25.978 --> 17:27.205
There are thousands of us.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.712
All wiped out.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.715
lt seems the Cardassians
have an ally...

17:30.783 --> 17:32.580
a species
from the Gamma Quadrant

17:32.651 --> 17:34.983
who supplied them
with ships and weapons.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.115
Atara?

17:39.391 --> 17:40.517
Roberto?

17:42.327 --> 17:44.921
Everyone except us is dead?

17:44.997 --> 17:47.124
Just about.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.929
Sveta and a few lucky ones
are in prison.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.263
No...

17:53.338 --> 17:54.168
B'Elanna...

17:54.239 --> 17:56.639
Don't!
Don't try to console me.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.573
l don't want to be comforted.

17:58.644 --> 18:01.010
Those were our friends...

18:01.080 --> 18:03.014
good people willing to put
their lives on the line

18:03.082 --> 18:04.208
for something they believed in

18:04.283 --> 18:05.978
and now you're telling
me that they are gone...

18:06.051 --> 18:07.040
that they are slaughtered.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.143
Those are the risks we all took.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.152
We knew where it could lead.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.052
lt's not right and you know it.

18:11.123 --> 18:14.286
l will make someone pay,
l swear l will.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.764
lf we ever get back.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.550
Tom...l heard there are

18:41.620 --> 18:43.212
at least 30 more letters
that have been downloaded.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.255
Oh, yeah?

18:44.323 --> 18:46.621
Neelix is supposed
to be on his way here now.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.320
What do you suppose
this is, anyway?

18:49.394 --> 18:51.157
What what is?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.925
This mystery dish.

18:52.998 --> 18:54.863
lt tastes vaguely like chicken,

18:54.933 --> 18:57.527
but it has the consistency
of corn husks.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.093
ls that all
you can think about--

18:59.171 --> 19:00.297
what you're eating?

19:00.405 --> 19:04.136
Well, l don't like guessing
at what l put in my stomach.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.974
Tom...we're getting
letters from home.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.410
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.414
Not particularly.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.507
l don't believe you.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.552
You know, it's really
not that bad.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.451
Here he comes.

19:16.522 --> 19:17.580
Good news.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.887
Seven has been able
to download some more letters.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.562
This one is for Susan Nicoletti.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.564
- ls she here?
- Oh, yes.

19:26.632 --> 19:27.189
Fitzpatrick.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.164
Right here.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.996
Thank you.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.838
Ah, Kyoto.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.341
Golwat.

19:39.811 --> 19:41.574
Thank you.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.739
Ashmore.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.576
- Dorado.
- l'm here.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.380
There's not going
to be one for me.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.420
He's not done yet.
Hang on.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.455
And finally...

19:51.857 --> 19:52.983
Parsons.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.626
l'm sorry if your name

19:57.696 --> 20:01.154
hasn't come up,
but Seven is still working.

20:01.233 --> 20:04.259
Neelix, l thought you
had over 30 letters.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.327
30?
Where did you hear that?

20:06.405 --> 20:08.464
That's what was going around.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.169
Don't pay any attention
to rumors.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.244
Right.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.987
Aren't you going
to eat your lunch?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.317
l'm not hungry.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.226
You shouldn't get
your hopes up, Harry.

20:29.294 --> 20:31.592
No hopes, no disappointments.

20:33.765 --> 20:35.733
l'm not you.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.873
Come in.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.004
Captain, l'm beginning
to have trouble

20:46.078 --> 20:47.170
accessing the datastream.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.339
The longer it remains
lodged in the relay station,

20:49.414 --> 20:50.711
the more it degrades.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.181
lf we could get near enough,

20:52.251 --> 20:54.719
we could try to stabilize
the containment field,

20:54.786 --> 20:57.880
but l can't risk taking
the ship in any closer.

20:57.956 --> 21:00.618
A shuttle could withstand
the gravimetric eddies

21:00.692 --> 21:01.852
more easily than Voyager.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.894
l'd like to try it.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.357
l'd want Commander Tuvok
to go with you.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.796
For what reason?

21:07.866 --> 21:10.858
lt isn't my custom
to send an away team of one.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.568
As you wish.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.348
Hi.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.815
Hi. l thought Seven
was working in here.

21:25.884 --> 21:26.851
She's gone with Tuvok

21:26.918 --> 21:28.977
to shore up the station's
confinement field.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.919
l've taken over for her.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.616
Disappointed?

21:34.693 --> 21:36.354
Of course not.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.827
Would you stop that?

21:37.896 --> 21:39.796
l've told you,
there's nothing between us.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.423
l know there's nothing
between you.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.990
lt's purely
a one- way attraction.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.592
Very funny.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.661
Harry, you might as well
wear a big sign

21:46.738 --> 21:48.000
that says,"l'm in love."

21:48.106 --> 21:49.471
Everyone sees it.

21:49.541 --> 21:52.772
Look, l'll admit
that for a while...

21:52.844 --> 21:54.436
Well, she's
a very attractive woman,

21:54.513 --> 21:55.707
but l've gotten over that.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.612
Okay.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.480
Fine. Believe whatever you want.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.384
lf you didn't come
down here to see her,

22:02.487 --> 22:03.852
why did you?

22:03.889 --> 22:05.550
l wanted to know...

22:07.292 --> 22:09.317
if l'd gotten a letter yet.

22:16.768 --> 22:19.760
Sorry. l haven't
seen anything so far.

22:22.741 --> 22:26.336
Do you think...there's going
to be one for everybody?

22:26.511 --> 22:28.536
l'm sure
that Starfleet contacted

22:28.613 --> 22:31.639
the families and friends
of everyone on this ship.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.617
They know how important
that would be.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.118
l hope so.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.917
Harry...you'll get one.

22:37.989 --> 22:40.048
Try to be patient.

22:50.836 --> 22:52.963
Commander, am l correct
in assuming

22:53.038 --> 22:55.199
that Vulcans are
incapable of lying?

22:55.273 --> 22:57.173
We are capable of telling lies.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.871
However, l have never found it
prudent or necessary to do so.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.413
You have never lied?

23:02.481 --> 23:05.177
Only under orders
from a superior officer.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.548
Then l must ask you something.

23:07.619 --> 23:08.916
ls it the Captain's custom

23:08.987 --> 23:11.353
to send at least two people
on an away mission?

23:11.423 --> 23:13.015
lt's not only her custom,

23:13.091 --> 23:15.525
it's recommended
Starfleet protocol.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.062
l see.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.258
ls there a purpose
to your question?

23:21.333 --> 23:24.928
l am wondering if the Captain
still doesn't trust me--

23:25.003 --> 23:27.369
if she feels
l require supervision.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.408
l am not certain
how the Captain regards you,

23:30.475 --> 23:32.306
but her decision
to have me accompany you

23:32.377 --> 23:33.867
on this mission
shouldn't be taken

23:33.945 --> 23:36.004
as evidence
of any particular attitude.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.978
l believe we are close enough
to emit a polaron pulse.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.954
Bring the main deflector
on line.

23:45.023 --> 23:46.547
Ready.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.963
The variance in the containment
field is now at. 29.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.228
That should prevent further
degradation of the signal.

23:57.302 --> 24:00.294
Let me ask you a question,
Seven.

24:00.372 --> 24:03.136
ls the Captain's opinion
important to you?

24:04.676 --> 24:06.439
My understanding
of the hierarchy on Voyager

24:06.511 --> 24:07.603
is that the Captain's opinion

24:07.679 --> 24:09.340
is important to every
member of the crew.

24:11.817 --> 24:12.749
What's happened?

24:12.818 --> 24:14.012
We've just been scanned

24:14.085 --> 24:16.019
by a subnucleonic beam
of some kind.

24:16.087 --> 24:18.453
The navigational sensors
have been disrupted.

24:18.523 --> 24:19.922
We must get Voyager to send out

24:19.991 --> 24:21.788
a directional beacon
to guide us back.

24:21.860 --> 24:22.918
Tuvok to Voyager.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.723
Voyager, please respond.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.855
Commander, we've lost
other systems as well.

24:26.932 --> 24:29.924
We have no communications,
no warp engines...

24:30.001 --> 24:31.662
and no weapons.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.670
l suspect this was
done intentionally

24:33.738 --> 24:35.706
by the ship
that's approaching rapidly

24:35.774 --> 24:36.798
off our port stern.

24:51.122 --> 24:54.683
They're at 50, 000 kilometers
and closing.

24:54.759 --> 24:56.693
Our shields
are losing integrity.

24:56.761 --> 24:59.286
l'll try to get at least
one phaser array back on line.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.025
Commander, one more hit

25:01.132 --> 25:02.531
and we'll be susceptible
to a hull breach.

25:02.567 --> 25:04.762
That ship is larger than ours.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.531
lf we lure it
closer to the station,

25:06.605 --> 25:08.539
it will be far more vulnerable

25:08.607 --> 25:10.598
to the gravitational eddies
than we are.

25:16.081 --> 25:17.708
A tractor beam.

25:17.782 --> 25:18.908
We're being pulled
toward the ship.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.712
l'll try to disrupt it.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.514
Unsuccessful.

25:22.587 --> 25:23.986
Launching a distress beacon.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.191
Torres to the Bridge.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.463
Go ahead.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.630
Captain, could Lieutenant Paris
come down here?

25:40.705 --> 25:43.469
l think l've got something
he'd want to see.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.407
He's on his way.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.383
lt's a letter for you.

25:52.450 --> 25:53.576
lt's coming through right now.

25:53.652 --> 25:54.846
For me?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.785
lt's right here.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.580
Who's it from?

26:00.692 --> 26:01.716
l can't tell yet.

26:01.760 --> 26:05.218
Maybe it's from the rehab colony

26:05.297 --> 26:07.561
telling me
l've violated probation.

26:07.632 --> 26:09.998
Why are you acting like this?

26:10.068 --> 26:12.662
l just want to know
who the letter's from, okay?

26:14.205 --> 26:15.729
We should know in a minute.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.200
l'll be on the Bridge.

26:19.277 --> 26:20.301
What, you're not going to wait?

26:20.378 --> 26:21.845
l'm on duty.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.881
Voyager is hanging in space.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.348
There's not a lot to do
at the helm.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.681
l just thought
that l should be at my post.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.050
You may be able to fool
someone else with that ploy,

26:30.121 --> 26:31.452
but you're talking to me, Tom.

26:33.725 --> 26:36.125
Just download the letter, okay?

26:37.162 --> 26:39.289
A little more has come in.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.332
lt's from Starfleet.

26:41.399 --> 26:46.029
From...an Admiral Owen.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.401
Do you know him?

26:49.808 --> 26:51.867
Admiral Owen Paris.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.343
That's my father.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.608
That's wonderful.

26:57.682 --> 27:00.412
Yeah, maybe.

27:05.557 --> 27:10.153
l...l don't know
exactly why, but...

27:10.228 --> 27:14.221
the more everybody gets excited
about these letters from home,

27:14.299 --> 27:16.790
the more l don't want
any part of it.

27:19.437 --> 27:20.665
Maybe because...

27:23.108 --> 27:26.771
what l have on Voyager...

27:26.845 --> 27:29.871
is so much better than anything
l ever had back there.

27:31.616 --> 27:34.084
l just don't want the reminder.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.553
You're not the same person
you were four years ago.

27:37.622 --> 27:39.453
What makes you think he is?

27:41.226 --> 27:42.921
No. You don't know him.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.154
At least give him a chance.

27:44.229 --> 27:45.355
He's obviously reaching out.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.455
When he forms an opinion
about something,

27:47.532 --> 27:49.864
nothing can change his mind.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.325
Fine.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.975
Excuse me if l can't feel
terribly sorry for you.

27:59.044 --> 28:02.946
l learned this morning that
a lot of my friends are dead

28:03.048 --> 28:05.881
and l've gone
from being so angry

28:05.917 --> 28:08.044
that l wanted to kill someone...

28:08.119 --> 28:11.418
to crying for an hour.

28:11.489 --> 28:13.354
And now l'm just trying to...

28:13.425 --> 28:15.791
to accept it and move on.

28:15.860 --> 28:20.456
B'Elanna...that's awful.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.990
Oh, l am so sorry.

28:25.603 --> 28:27.161
And here l am
going on about something

28:27.238 --> 28:28.569
that doesn't even matter
anymore.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.608
No, no. l'm sorry.

28:30.675 --> 28:33.166
lt obviously does.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.804
You care what he thinks
about you.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.508
Yeah.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.181
Yeah, l guess l still do.

28:48.326 --> 28:51.022
l'll let you know
when l get the whole letter.

29:00.271 --> 29:02.296
Come in.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.001
Looks like Tuvok and Seven
pulled it off.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.601
The containment field
has stabilized quite a bit.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.146
B'Elanna says
she's downloading the letters

29:09.214 --> 29:10.146
much more easily now.

29:10.215 --> 29:11.147
That's good news.

29:11.216 --> 29:12.342
They don't have the shuttle
on sensors yet,

29:12.417 --> 29:13.850
but they should be back soon.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.977
l've learned
a few interesting things

29:16.054 --> 29:17.783
about that relay station.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.848
lt's generating as much energy

29:20.925 --> 29:23.792
every minute as a typical
star puts out in a year.

29:23.862 --> 29:24.851
What's amazing to me

29:24.929 --> 29:26.954
is that someone
100, 000 years ago

29:27.031 --> 29:28.965
was harvesting
microsingularities.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.695
lf nobody shows up to protest,

29:31.770 --> 29:33.203
l'd like to stay here
for a while--

29:33.271 --> 29:35.330
try to find the answers
to some of these questions.

29:35.406 --> 29:37.237
This is the kind
of archeological puzzle

29:37.308 --> 29:39.708
that's always fascinated me.

29:39.778 --> 29:40.767
Want a cup?

29:40.845 --> 29:42.506
No, thanks.

29:47.585 --> 29:49.780
You haven't mentioned
your letter.

29:49.854 --> 29:51.219
Who was it from?

29:52.690 --> 29:53.918
lt was from Mark...

29:53.992 --> 29:56.483
the man l was engaged to.

29:56.561 --> 29:58.893
He told me
about the litter of puppies

29:58.963 --> 30:01.932
my dog had--
how he found homes for them,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.401
how devastated he was
when Voyager was lost...

30:05.470 --> 30:08.030
how he held out hopes
we were alive

30:08.106 --> 30:09.698
longer than most people did...

30:09.774 --> 30:13.073
until he realized that he
was clinging to a fantasy.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.739
So he began living
his life again--

30:16.815 --> 30:21.445
meeting people,
letting go of the past.

30:24.722 --> 30:25.984
About four months ago,

30:26.057 --> 30:28.423
he married a woman
who works with him.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.018
He's very happy.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.627
And how do you feel about that?

30:37.602 --> 30:39.866
Well, l knew he'd eventually
move on with his life...

30:42.507 --> 30:45.670
but there was such
a finality to that letter.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.267
Kim to the Captain.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.403
Can you come to the Bridge?

30:54.986 --> 30:55.953
What is it?

30:56.020 --> 30:57.044
We picked up

30:57.121 --> 30:59.385
an automated distress signal
from Tuvok's shuttle.

30:59.457 --> 31:01.448
Sensors show
there's no one on board.

32:12.530 --> 32:13.861
Seven.

32:17.702 --> 32:18.964
Seven of Nine.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.974
Where are we?

32:29.047 --> 32:32.346
l assume
we're on the alien ship.

32:34.218 --> 32:36.379
This is most uncomfortable.

32:40.758 --> 32:41.986
Have you seen anyone?

32:42.093 --> 32:43.560
No.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.721
lf we can reach
one of those blades,

32:45.797 --> 32:48.994
perhaps we can
cut through these bindings.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.137
You were pathetic prey.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.841
Easily taken.

32:57.909 --> 32:59.877
The hunt was not satisfying.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.240
l want information.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.909
Why do you violate our property?

33:06.985 --> 33:11.183
l could snap your puny neck
with one twist.

33:13.891 --> 33:16.086
Hardly worth taking.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.092
Answer me.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.924
Why do you use our modules?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.055
We're trying to retrieve

33:20.131 --> 33:21.928
important messages
from our home.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.934
Return us to our ship
and we'll be on our way

33:25.036 --> 33:26.435
without trespassing again.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.335
l took you in a fair hunt.

33:28.406 --> 33:30.897
l claim the relics
of the chase.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.854
Are the others on your ship

33:44.922 --> 33:47.413
able to put up more
of a fight than you?

33:47.492 --> 33:49.585
You will find our Captain
a formidable opponent

33:49.660 --> 33:51.992
and our ship heavily armed.

33:52.063 --> 33:56.329
Good. Strong prey makes
for a better hunt.

33:56.401 --> 33:57.993
Release us now
and you'll be safe.

33:58.069 --> 34:01.163
Otherwise, we will destroy you.

34:02.407 --> 34:05.399
Pitiful relics.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.501
They are the first
of their kind.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.478
l will be envied.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.174
l've located their ship.

34:11.248 --> 34:13.581
lt's 4, 000 ketrics
from the module.

34:13.650 --> 34:15.641
We'll be there within the hour.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.880
Go to stalking mode.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.324
Why do you hesitate?

34:21.391 --> 34:23.053
The rest of the group
is on its way.

34:23.127 --> 34:25.891
l wanted to claim
this prey for myself.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.692
We may not be able
to take them alone.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.324
We need the strength
of the others.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.925
l won't share prey
with the others.

34:32.036 --> 34:35.062
These two must be
the only relics!

34:35.139 --> 34:36.663
Prepare them!

34:39.811 --> 34:40.937
Captain.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.774
lt's tricky to scan
through the interference,

34:42.847 --> 34:44.781
but l think
l'm detecting a ship.

34:44.849 --> 34:46.339
What kind of ship?

34:46.417 --> 34:48.543
Let me reconfigure
the sensor array.

34:48.619 --> 34:50.678
lt's Hirogen

34:50.755 --> 34:52.813
and Tuvok and Seven
are on it.

34:55.326 --> 34:56.315
Hail them.

34:57.662 --> 34:59.323
On screen.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.627
l'm Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

35:01.732 --> 35:03.893
You have two
of my crew on board.

35:03.968 --> 35:06.698
Disconnect your link
to our module

35:06.771 --> 35:08.830
and leave this space.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.271
Not without my people.

35:10.341 --> 35:12.206
They are my relics.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.608
l'm prepared to offer
you something

35:14.679 --> 35:15.873
for their safe return.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.847
Surely we can come
to an agreement.

35:17.915 --> 35:22.352
lf the rest of my group arrives,
you will be taken as well.

35:22.420 --> 35:25.321
l'm giving you a chance to run.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.118
We don't run.

35:27.191 --> 35:28.920
Captain, l've got three
more ships on sensors

35:28.993 --> 35:31.154
coming toward us at high warp.

35:31.229 --> 35:32.253
Don't be foolish.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.628
Leave now and save yourselves.

35:34.699 --> 35:37.133
Give me my people
and we'll do just that.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.691
They're mine!

35:38.769 --> 35:40.737
Then get ready for a fight.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.102
Red Alert.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.808
Are they prepared?

35:50.882 --> 35:53.646
Yes.
But now is not the time for it.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.481
We should wait
until the others arrive

35:55.553 --> 35:56.542
and take the ship.

35:56.621 --> 35:58.521
l want to make the first kill.

35:58.589 --> 35:59.988
You will verify it.

36:00.024 --> 36:02.356
lf there is a battle,
we must join it.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.826
The others can wage the battle.

36:04.896 --> 36:08.059
Perhaps you are more interested
in collecting relics.

36:08.132 --> 36:11.192
Perhaps your judgment
is clouded.

36:11.269 --> 36:13.203
Don't question me again.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.102
We do it now.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.607
l suggest you think carefully
about your decision.

36:17.675 --> 36:21.702
lf you kill us, our Captain will
hunt you down and show no mercy.

36:21.779 --> 36:23.747
l'm not concerned.

36:23.814 --> 36:25.145
Lower the harness.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.053
A long, coiled intestine--

36:31.122 --> 36:33.113
an interesting trophy.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.682
What possible use could you
make of my intestines?

36:35.760 --> 36:38.285
Unusual relics are prized.

36:38.362 --> 36:42.924
Yours will make me envied by men
and pursued by women.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.594
You are a crude species.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.036
Only your size
makes you formidable.

36:49.674 --> 36:53.804
Your insults are as pitiful
as your efforts to escape.

36:56.847 --> 36:58.542
This one first.

36:58.616 --> 37:02.074
l want the female to witness
what will happen to her.

37:02.186 --> 37:03.244
Their bone structure

37:03.287 --> 37:05.482
makes cutting
through the back difficult.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.080
This will take time.

37:12.730 --> 37:13.492
Bridge to Torres.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.496
Torres here, Captain.

37:14.565 --> 37:15.497
How much longer?

37:15.566 --> 37:17.056
l'm getting it out
piece by piece.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.328
At least another half hour.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.165
How are you coming?

37:20.238 --> 37:22.729
That ship has some kind
of monotanium armor plating.

37:22.807 --> 37:24.365
lt's scattering
the targeting beam.

37:24.442 --> 37:25.909
The other three ships
are closing.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.102
They're within
6, 000 kilometers.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.578
Captain, those ships
have massive weapons.

37:29.647 --> 37:31.171
They've definitely
got us outgunned.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.443
Harry, let me see those ships

37:32.516 --> 37:33.813
in relation
to the relay station.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.078
Yes, ma'am.

37:35.152 --> 37:37.712
Maybe we can use that quantum
singularity to our advantage.

37:37.788 --> 37:38.914
How?

37:39.023 --> 37:40.752
lf we can boost the effect
of the singularity--

37:40.825 --> 37:42.793
increase the gravitational pull,

37:42.860 --> 37:43.792
we might be able to stop them.

37:43.861 --> 37:46.022
The pull would increase
if we could weaken

37:46.097 --> 37:47.359
the station's containment field.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.830
An antithoron burst might do it.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.924
lf we're not careful,
we might be pulled in as well.

37:51.002 --> 37:51.934
Don't worry.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.265
We're going to be ready for it.

37:53.337 --> 37:57.273
Harry, create a low- level
warp field around Voyager--

37:57.341 --> 37:58.603
sublight energy level.

37:58.676 --> 38:01.110
That should help counteract
the gravitational pull.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.179
lf the field is too strong,

38:02.213 --> 38:04.204
we won't be able to beam
Tuvok and Seven aboard.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.715
Then you'll have to find
the right balance,

38:05.783 --> 38:06.807
won't you, Harry?

38:06.884 --> 38:07.942
Yes, ma'am.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.111
On my mark,

38:09.186 --> 38:12.747
direct a level- 8 antithoron
burst toward the station.

38:12.823 --> 38:15.383
Have thrusters ready
for full reverse, Mr. Paris.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.619
Understood.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.787
l've established
a low- level warp field, Captain.

38:18.863 --> 38:20.057
Antithoron system is on line.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.826
l'm ready with thrusters.

38:21.899 --> 38:22.888
Do it.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.097
lt's working.

38:28.172 --> 38:29.901
Try the transporter lock
again, Harry.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.035
Stabilize the ship!

38:36.447 --> 38:39.541
l can't. The gravity well
is pulling us in!

38:50.528 --> 38:53.292
That vessel is weakening
the module's containment field.

38:53.364 --> 38:54.763
Ready weapons.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.265
Signal the others to attack.

38:58.102 --> 38:59.160
Torres to the Bridge.

38:59.236 --> 39:00.100
Janeway here.

39:00.204 --> 39:01.671
The antithoron burst
collapsed the signal.

39:01.706 --> 39:04.072
l've gotten as much of the
message as l'm going to get.

39:04.141 --> 39:05.130
Acknowledged.

39:05.209 --> 39:06.176
Hail those ships.

39:06.243 --> 39:07.369
Channel open.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.072
This is Captain Janeway.

39:09.146 --> 39:12.013
Agree to retreat, and we'll
restore the containment field.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.311
Captain, they're firing!

39:14.885 --> 39:17.979
Their weapons are destabilizing
the containment field!

39:18.055 --> 39:19.852
This is Janeway.
Stop firing.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.518
You're putting yourselves
in grave dan...

39:22.593 --> 39:23.685
The field is going!

39:23.761 --> 39:25.524
The singularity
is about to be exposed!

39:32.570 --> 39:34.401
Captain, the ship
with Tuvok and Seven

39:34.472 --> 39:35.700
is still being pulled in.

39:35.773 --> 39:36.762
Get a tractor beam on it.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.399
l have Tuvok and Seven targeted,

39:38.476 --> 39:40.068
but if we try
to transport them now,

39:40.144 --> 39:41.873
the gravity well could
scatter their patterns.

39:41.979 --> 39:42.911
The tractor beam is weakening.

39:42.980 --> 39:43.912
We're going to lose them!

39:43.981 --> 39:44.913
Harry, we have to risk it.

39:44.982 --> 39:46.609
Activating the transporter.

39:47.785 --> 39:50.913
Full reverse! lncrease
power to the engines!

39:51.021 --> 39:53.182
No response.

39:53.257 --> 39:54.189
Do you have them?

39:54.258 --> 39:55.247
Not yet.

39:55.326 --> 39:56.258
Their patterns are distorting.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.589
Narrow the annular
confinement beam.

39:57.661 --> 39:58.855
Tractor beam's
almost gone, Captain.

39:58.929 --> 39:59.918
We're losing this tug- of- war.

40:00.030 --> 40:02.021
Reroute all secondary power
to the tractor emitters.

40:02.099 --> 40:03.464
The tractor beam collapsed.

40:03.534 --> 40:05.229
That ship is headed
into the black hole.

40:05.302 --> 40:06.701
l'm realigning
the pattern buffer.

40:06.771 --> 40:08.295
l've got one more shot at it.

40:15.946 --> 40:18.073
l got them!
They're in Transporter Room 2.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.081
l need more power!

40:19.150 --> 40:20.276
We're being pulled in!

40:20.351 --> 40:22.842
Transfer all available power
to the engines.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.079
lt's not enough!

40:25.156 --> 40:26.418
Shut down life support.

40:26.490 --> 40:27.752
Structural integrity is failing.

40:27.825 --> 40:28.792
The hull is starting to buckle.

40:28.859 --> 40:29.826
We're going in!

40:29.894 --> 40:32.692
Open the antimatter injectors
to 120 percent.

40:32.763 --> 40:33.991
Captain, that could
breach the core.

40:34.064 --> 40:35.759
So will that black hole.
Now, just do it.

40:35.833 --> 40:36.857
Yes, ma'am.

40:41.872 --> 40:42.964
We're free.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.871
Resume course.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.967
l'll be in Astrometrics.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.513
Captain, look at this.

40:51.582 --> 40:53.675
The energy released
from the singularity

40:53.751 --> 40:56.379
created a massive discharge
along the relay network.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.513
lt disabled every one
of the stations.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.454
How much of the message
were you able to get?

41:00.558 --> 41:02.617
l got most
of the encrypted Starfleet text

41:02.660 --> 41:04.218
and a few more personal letters.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.354
How soon can we see
what Starfleet had to say?

41:06.430 --> 41:07.829
Oh, it'll take
some time to decode.

41:07.898 --> 41:10.196
Harry should
probably work on it.

41:12.436 --> 41:15.735
Well, if you'll excuse me,
l have a few letters to deliver.

41:15.806 --> 41:16.773
Neelix can do that.

41:16.841 --> 41:17.933
No need.

41:18.008 --> 41:20.568
Anyway, there's one
that l want to do personally.

41:28.619 --> 41:29.711
Good news, Harry.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.846
l got this at the last minute.

41:34.091 --> 41:35.820
lt's from my folks.

41:35.893 --> 41:36.860
Thanks.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.992
l'm sorry, Tom.

41:45.069 --> 41:47.435
l wasn't able
to download yours in time.

41:50.207 --> 41:52.607
Just when l was getting eager
to read it.

41:52.676 --> 41:55.201
You could assume
that he said he loves you...

41:56.780 --> 41:58.475
and that he's proud of you.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.445
l think l will.

42:05.789 --> 42:07.848
Captain's Log, supplemental.

42:07.925 --> 42:09.517
Seven of Nine
and Commander Tuvok

42:09.593 --> 42:11.356
suffered no serious
physical damage

42:11.428 --> 42:13.658
after their encounter
on the alien ship.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.926
l've been eager to hear
Tuvok's impressions

42:16.000 --> 42:17.934
of the species
who took them hostage.

42:18.002 --> 42:19.765
l learned
very little about them,

42:19.837 --> 42:22.704
but l believe we should consider
them extremely dangerous.

42:22.773 --> 42:25.503
They seem to lack
any moral center.

42:25.576 --> 42:27.043
Do you know
why the relay network

42:27.111 --> 42:28.271
was so important to them?

42:28.345 --> 42:32.372
No. l assume they used it
for communications, as we did.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.542
Well, they won't be
using it anymore.

42:34.618 --> 42:37.348
They won't be pleased
about that, Captain.

42:37.421 --> 42:39.218
l doubt we've seen
the last of them.

42:40.257 --> 42:41.246
Come in.

42:44.261 --> 42:46.593
lf you'll excuse me.

42:46.664 --> 42:47.790
Commander.

42:47.865 --> 42:51.096
Repair teams have inspected
the ship from stem to stern.

42:51.168 --> 42:54.433
Except for some maintenance
that's needed on the warp coils,

42:54.505 --> 42:55.563
everything seems fine.

42:55.639 --> 42:56.799
l suppose so.

42:56.874 --> 42:57.841
Want some coffee?

42:57.908 --> 42:59.136
Thanks.

42:59.209 --> 43:00.107
Cream and sugar?

43:00.210 --> 43:01.177
Two sugars.

43:01.211 --> 43:02.838
Oh...two sugars?

43:02.913 --> 43:04.744
You know, you drink
too much of that stuff.

43:04.815 --> 43:05.747
Really?

43:05.816 --> 43:06.748
lf l'm not mistaken,

43:06.817 --> 43:07.909
that's your third cup
this morning.

43:07.985 --> 43:09.646
Fourth.
And on a day like today,

43:09.720 --> 43:11.381
it won't be my last.

43:11.455 --> 43:15.516
Coffee: the finest organic
suspension ever devised.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.026
lt's gotten me
through the worst

43:17.094 --> 43:18.186
of the last three years.

43:18.262 --> 43:20.856
l beat the Borg with it.

43:20.931 --> 43:25.163
Oh, l'm sure Voyager
will be fine.

43:25.235 --> 43:28.898
But l'm worried that the crew
might be a different story.

43:28.973 --> 43:31.271
l think they were
hoping mail call

43:31.342 --> 43:33.902
would become a regular part
of their day.

43:33.978 --> 43:36.105
Neelix is putting together
an impromptu party.

43:36.180 --> 43:37.647
He thought it might
cheer them up.

43:37.715 --> 43:38.977
Good idea.
When will it be?

43:39.049 --> 43:40.209
As soon as he can
get people together.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.410
Leave it to Neelix to come up

43:41.485 --> 43:43.043
with the right idea
at the right time.

43:45.055 --> 43:46.852
How are you doing?

43:46.924 --> 43:48.357
Me? l'm fine.

43:48.425 --> 43:49.949
You'd say that if you just had

43:50.027 --> 43:52.154
your legs torn off
by a Trayken beast.

43:52.229 --> 43:54.925
Look what you've been through
in the last few days.

43:54.999 --> 43:56.796
We finally make
a connection with home

43:56.867 --> 43:58.596
and then it's
ripped away from us.

43:58.669 --> 44:00.193
We manage to make another enemy

44:00.304 --> 44:01.771
who's going to try
and hunt us down

44:01.805 --> 44:05.070
and destroy us,
and on top of that...

44:05.142 --> 44:07.042
lt's all right.
You can say it.

44:07.111 --> 44:10.808
On top of all that,
l got a"Dear John" letter.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.074
lt wasn't really a surprise.

44:15.152 --> 44:18.553
l guess l didn't really
expect him to wait for me

44:18.622 --> 44:20.749
considering the circumstances.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.384
But it made me realize
that l was using him

44:23.460 --> 44:25.291
as a safety net, you know--

44:25.362 --> 44:28.354
as a way to avoid becoming
involved with someone else.

44:28.432 --> 44:30.525
You don't have that safety net
anymore.

44:30.601 --> 44:32.398
That's right.

44:32.469 --> 44:35.267
But then again,
my life is far from uneventful

44:35.339 --> 44:37.170
here in the Delta Quadrant.

44:37.241 --> 44:39.232
lt's not like l would
have had a chance

44:39.309 --> 44:40.708
to pursue a relationship,

44:40.778 --> 44:43.212
even if l had realized
l was alone.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.907
You're hardly alone.

44:44.982 --> 44:49.214
And to my way of thinking,
there's still plenty of time.

44:49.286 --> 44:51.686
Plenty of time.

44:51.755 --> 44:54.918
Neelix to the ready room.
The party's about to begin

44:54.992 --> 44:56.254
and there are
only two people missing.

44:56.326 --> 44:58.556
We're on our way.
