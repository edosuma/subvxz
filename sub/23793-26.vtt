>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:31.066 --> 00:31.834
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:31.900 --> 00:33.133
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.300
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:34.367 --> 00:35.600
US.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.834
AND LOOK, AFTER THE

00:36.900 --> 00:38.400
RALPH-INDUCING DEVIL'S TRIANGLE

00:38.467 --> 00:39.600
THAT WAS LAST WEEK, IT REALLY

00:39.667 --> 00:44.033
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THINGS

00:44.100 --> 00:48.433
HAD BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER

00:48.500 --> 00:49.000
THIS WEEK, BUT THEY FRANKLY

00:49.066 --> 00:49.266
WEREN'T.

00:49.333 --> 00:49.967
THE U.N. RELEASED A CLIMATE

00:50.033 --> 00:50.633
REPORT THAT SAID WE MAY ONLY

00:50.700 --> 00:51.800
HAVE TWO GOOD DECADES LEFT.

00:51.867 --> 00:52.233
THAT STUDY WAS THEN

00:52.300 --> 00:52.934
ENTHUSIASTICALLY CO-SIGNED BY

00:53.000 --> 00:53.767
ONE OF THE STRONGEST HURRICANES

00:53.834 --> 00:54.900
EVER TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE

00:54.967 --> 00:56.867
U.S., THEN WHATEVER THE LIVING

00:56.934 --> 00:57.934
FUCK THIS WAS HAPPENED, AND THEN

00:57.967 --> 01:01.467
THERE WAS THIS:

01:01.533 --> 01:04.533
>> NEIL ARMSTRONG IS THE MAN

01:04.600 --> 01:07.500
THAT PLANTED THE FLAG.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.767
THINK OF THAT, ON THE FACE OF

01:09.834 --> 01:15.100
THE MOON.

01:15.166 --> 01:16.433
HE PLANTED THAT FLAG, THAT

01:16.500 --> 01:17.567
AMERICAN FLAG, RIGHT ON THE FACE

01:17.633 --> 01:19.367
OF THE MOON.

01:19.433 --> 01:21.166
THERE WAS NO KNEELING.

01:21.233 --> 01:22.900
THERE WAS NO NOTHING.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.200
THERE WAS NO GAMES.

01:25.266 --> 01:26.433
THERE WAS NO GAMES.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.100
BOOM.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.767
BOOM.

01:30.834 --> 01:32.333
>> John: HOW ARE YOU TYING THE

01:32.400 --> 01:38.367
NFL PROTESTS TO NEIL ARMSTRONG?

01:38.433 --> 01:39.033
I MEAN, YOU ARE RIGHT, THERE WAS

01:39.100 --> 01:39.734
NO KNEELING.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.567
ALSO NO ONE WAS PLAYING THE

01:40.633 --> 01:41.367
NATIONAL ANTHEM, THERE WAS NO

01:41.433 --> 01:42.800
FOOTBALL GAME SCHEDULED IN THE

01:42.867 --> 01:46.500
SEA OF TRANQUILITY THAT DAY,

01:46.567 --> 01:47.166
ONE MORE THING, NO BLACK

01:47.233 --> 01:48.233
ASTRONAUTS HAD RECENTLY BEEN

01:48.300 --> 01:48.867
SHOT BY MOON COPS, SO REALLY

01:48.934 --> 01:50.967
NONE OF THE ESSENTIAL

01:51.033 --> 01:53.467
INGREDIENTS HAD COME TOGETHER

01:53.533 --> 01:54.100
AT THAT POINT.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.567
TRUMP WAS AT THAT RALLY BECAUSE

01:55.633 --> 01:56.100
HE WAS TRYING TO WHIP UP

01:56.166 --> 01:57.133
ENTHUSIASM AHEAD OF THE

01:57.200 --> 01:57.800
MIDTERMS, WHICH ARE NOW LESS

01:57.867 --> 01:58.734
THAN A MONTH AWAY.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.734
THE ADS ARE STARTING TO ROLL OUT

01:59.800 --> 02:01.600
INTENSELY, AND SOME ARE

02:01.667 --> 02:03.367
UNDENIABLY PRO-TRUMP, LIKE THIS

02:03.433 --> 02:04.967
ONE FROM FLORIDA GUBERNATORIAL

02:05.033 --> 02:07.100
CANDIDATE RON DeSANTIS:

02:07.166 --> 02:08.500
>> EVERYONE KNOWS MY HUSBAND

02:08.567 --> 02:09.834
RON DeSANTIS IS ENDORSED BY

02:09.900 --> 02:11.867
PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT HE'S ALSO

02:11.934 --> 02:13.133
AN AMAZING DAD.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.333
RON LOVES PLAYING WITH THE KIDS.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.900
>> BUILD THE WALL.

02:16.967 --> 02:17.734
>> HE'S TEACHING MADISON TO

02:17.800 --> 02:18.633
TALK.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.333
>> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.567
>> HE READS STORIES.

02:21.633 --> 02:23.066
>> THEN MR. TRUMP SAID,

02:23.133 --> 02:25.333
"YOU'RE FIRED."

02:25.400 --> 02:29.800
I LOVE THAT PART.

02:29.867 --> 02:35.700
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, I THINK

02:35.767 --> 02:36.433
THAT'S BORDERLINE CHILD ABUSE

02:36.500 --> 02:37.333
RIGHT THERE.

02:37.367 --> 02:37.934
SECOND, I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD

02:38.000 --> 02:38.533
BE DONE, BUT HE PRODUCED AN AD

02:38.600 --> 02:39.066
ESSENTIALLY SAYING "THE

02:39.133 --> 02:39.633
PRESIDENT'S SLOGANS ARE FAIRY

02:39.700 --> 02:40.333
TALES FOR NAIVE INFANT

02:40.400 --> 02:40.967
CHILDREN," AND SOMEHOW INTENDED

02:41.033 --> 02:42.300
IT IN A GOOD WAY.

02:42.367 --> 02:43.567
NOW, THE ONE THING I WILL SAY

02:43.633 --> 02:44.533
FOR THAT AD IS THAT IT'S A RARE

02:44.600 --> 02:45.133
EXAMPLE OF POSITIVE MESSAGING,

02:45.200 --> 02:46.100
BECAUSE THERE IS GROWING CONCERN

02:46.166 --> 02:49.200
THAT THIS YEAR'S CAMPAIGNING IS

02:49.266 --> 02:50.066
GETTING TOO NASTY.

02:50.133 --> 02:50.934
LAST SUNDAY, ERIC HOLDER FACED

02:50.967 --> 02:51.934
CRITICISM AFTER SUGGESTING

02:51.967 --> 02:53.066
DEMOCRATS CHANGE THEIR MOTTO

02:53.133 --> 02:54.300
FROM "WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO

02:54.367 --> 02:56.200
HIGH" TO "WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE

02:56.266 --> 02:57.967
KICK 'EM," WHICH IS BOTH A

02:58.066 --> 02:59.300
MASSIVE PIVOT ON POLITICAL

02:59.367 --> 03:01.066
MESSAGING AND ALSO MY STRATEGY

03:01.133 --> 03:04.066
FOR DEALING WITH SQUIRRELS.

03:04.133 --> 03:05.233
WHEN THEY GO LOW, I KICK 'EM.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.633
WHEN THEY GO HIGH, I SWAT 'EM.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.166
AND IF THEY SWARM, I DO A MOVE I

03:09.233 --> 03:12.967
LIKE TO CALL "HELICOPTER FISTS."

03:13.066 --> 03:14.700
NOW, TRUMP, THE GRAND WIZARD OF

03:14.767 --> 03:16.533
CIVIL DISCOURSE, CALLED HOLDER'S

03:16.633 --> 03:17.834
COMMENTS DISGUSTING,

03:17.900 --> 03:20.667
WHICH IS CLEARLY RIDICULOUS

03:20.734 --> 03:21.567
COMING FROM HIM, BUT IT'S ALSO

03:21.633 --> 03:22.800
PRETTY HYPOCRITICAL FROM THE

03:22.867 --> 03:26.967
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN GENERAL.

03:27.066 --> 03:27.633
BECAUSE JUST THE DAY AFTER TRUMP

03:27.700 --> 03:28.266
SAID THAT, THEIR CANDIDATE FOR

03:28.333 --> 03:28.934
PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR SAID THIS:

03:29.000 --> 03:29.700
>> GOVERNOR WOLF, LET ME TELL

03:29.767 --> 03:30.667
YOU, BETWEEN NOW AND

03:30.734 --> 03:31.667
NOVEMBER 6TH, YOU BETTER PUT ON

03:31.734 --> 03:32.567
A CATCHER'S MASK ON YOUR FACE

03:32.633 --> 03:33.467
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO STOMP ALL

03:33.533 --> 03:41.000
OVER YOUR FACE WITH GOLF SPIKES,

03:41.066 --> 03:41.800
BECAUSE I'M GONNA WIN THIS FOR

03:41.867 --> 03:42.900
THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND

03:42.967 --> 03:44.433
WE'RE THROWING YOU OUT OF OFFICE

03:44.500 --> 03:45.900
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SICK

03:45.967 --> 03:47.000
AND TIRED OF YOUR NEGATIVE ADS.

03:47.066 --> 03:48.367
>> John: JESUS CHRIST!

03:48.433 --> 03:49.867
HOW CAN YOU BE "ANTI-NEGATIVE

03:49.934 --> 03:51.633
ADS" WHEN YOUR ENTIRE AD FEELS

03:51.700 --> 03:52.633
LIKE A MAN GETTING INTO A FIGHT

03:52.700 --> 03:54.567
IN A GARAGE?

03:54.633 --> 03:55.567
"PUT ON A CATCHER'S MITT,

03:55.633 --> 03:56.800
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO STOMP ON

03:56.867 --> 03:57.533
YOUR FACE WITH GOLF CLEATS, PIN

03:57.600 --> 04:00.233
YOU DOWN WITH A LEAF RAKE, JAM

04:00.300 --> 04:02.000
YOUR FEET INTO A SNOW BLOWER,

04:02.066 --> 04:03.700
AND RUN YOU OVER WITH MY WIFE'S

04:03.767 --> 04:05.000
2016 VOLVO STATION WAGON, YOU

04:05.066 --> 04:15.166
WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!"

04:15.233 --> 04:17.000
LET'S RAISE IT HERE, ASSHOLE!

04:17.066 --> 04:17.533
AND LOOK, I'M NOT A FAN OF

04:17.600 --> 04:18.000
ATTACK ADS.

04:18.066 --> 04:18.967
THEY'RE NEVER PRETTY.

04:19.033 --> 04:19.667
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

04:19.734 --> 04:20.600
SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND TRULY

04:20.633 --> 04:21.633
ELEVATES THE FORM.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.767
AND MY FAVORITE AD THAT'S COME

04:22.834 --> 04:23.867
OUT THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON WAS ONE

04:23.934 --> 04:25.500
IN TEXAS WHICH REALLY STRIKES

04:25.567 --> 04:27.133
AT THE ESSENTIAL ESSENCE OF

04:27.200 --> 04:28.633
TED CRUZ.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.700
>> SOMEBODY LEFT SOMETHING ON MY

04:30.767 --> 04:32.300
DOOR THE OTHER DAY.

04:32.367 --> 04:33.266
IT SAID, "TED CRUZ IS TOUGH AS

04:33.333 --> 04:35.800
TEXAS."

04:37.033 --> 04:38.133
I MEAN, COME ON.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.567
IF SOMEBODY CALLED MY WIFE A DOG

04:39.633 --> 04:41.100
AND SAID MY DADDY WAS IN ON THE

04:41.166 --> 04:42.133
KENNEDY ASSASSINATION, I

04:42.200 --> 04:44.166
WOULDN'T BE KISSING THEIR ASS.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.367
YOU DRAG THEIR ASS OUT BY THE

04:45.433 --> 04:46.433
WOODSHED AND KICK THEIR ASS,

04:46.500 --> 04:51.367
TED.

04:51.433 --> 04:58.600
COME ON, TED.

04:58.667 --> 04:59.800
>> John: COME ON.

04:59.867 --> 05:00.967
IT'S JUST HIS NAME, AND SOMEHOW,

05:01.066 --> 05:02.500
THAT FINAL "TED" MIGHT BE THE

05:02.567 --> 05:04.533
MEANEST THING EVER SAID ABOUT

05:04.600 --> 05:05.233
TED CRUZ.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.467
THAT'S DEVASTATING.

05:06.533 --> 05:07.867
HONESTLY, THAT AD COULD'VE HAD

05:07.934 --> 05:09.533
EXACTLY THE SAME IMPACT IF IT

05:09.600 --> 05:11.934
WERE JUST THREE SECONDS LONG.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.400
>> COME ON, TED.

05:14.467 --> 05:15.867
>> John: SEE?

05:15.934 --> 05:16.567
THAT GETS THE POINT ACROSS

05:16.633 --> 05:18.800
PERFECTLY.

05:18.867 --> 05:19.867
THAT MAN IS AN ASSASSIN WHOSE

05:19.934 --> 05:22.400
WEAPON IS HIS TONE OF VOICE, AND

05:22.467 --> 05:25.500
I AM 100% CONFIDENT THAT THERE

05:25.567 --> 05:26.266
IS NOTHING HE COULD NOT DESTROY

05:26.333 --> 05:27.133
SIMPLY BY SAYING ITS NAME WITH

05:27.200 --> 05:28.834
FULL TEXAS CONTEMPT.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.100
AND THE REASON I'M SO CONFIDENT

05:30.166 --> 05:31.633
IS, WE TRACKED THAT MAN DOWN,

05:31.700 --> 05:33.266
AND PUT IT TO THE TEST.

05:33.333 --> 05:38.467
TAKE A LOOK.

05:38.533 --> 05:39.333
>> Announcer: AND NOW, THE MAN

05:39.400 --> 05:43.367
FROM THE TED CRUZ ADDS SIZE

05:43.433 --> 05:43.934
EIGHT MORE NAMES WITH TOTAL

05:44.000 --> 05:45.333
CONTEMPT.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.600
>> ED SHEERAN.

05:47.667 --> 05:51.967
DIANE KEATON.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.333
BANKSY.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.533
MADONNA.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.533
LABRADOOBLE.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.233
CHER.

06:01.266 --> 06:03.400
LOBSTER FEST.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.600
JOHN OLIVER.

06:06.633 --> 06:06.867
JOHN OLIVER.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.800
JOHN OLIVER?

06:08.867 --> 06:11.934
COME ON, JOHN.

06:11.967 --> 06:13.100
>> John: MOVING ON.

06:13.166 --> 06:13.967
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

06:14.066 --> 06:15.066
SAUDI ARABIA, BIRTHPLACE OF THE

06:15.133 --> 06:16.500
PROPHET MUHAMMAD.

06:16.567 --> 06:20.600
THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.200
OUR GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT MUST

06:23.266 --> 06:28.934
HAVE DECIDED AGAINST THAT ONE

06:28.967 --> 06:30.166
FOR SOME REASON.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.467
NOW, SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN IN

06:31.533 --> 06:32.100
THE NEWS THIS WEEK FOR A TRULY

06:32.166 --> 06:32.900
APPALLING REASON.

06:32.967 --> 06:33.667
IT HAS TO DO WITH SAUDI

06:33.734 --> 06:34.266
JOURNALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI, A

06:34.333 --> 06:36.266
U.S. RESIDENT AND COLUMNIST FOR

06:36.333 --> 06:37.166
"THE WASHINGTON POST" WHO HAS

06:37.233 --> 06:37.767
NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE HE STEPPED

06:37.834 --> 06:38.400
INTO THE SAUDI CONSULATE IN

06:38.467 --> 06:39.200
TURKEY TO PICK UP SOME PAPERWORK

06:39.266 --> 06:39.934
12 DAYS AGO.

06:39.967 --> 06:40.800
>> THIS IS JAMAL KHASHOGGI

06:40.867 --> 06:41.934
CAPTURED ON CLOSED-CIRCUIT

06:41.967 --> 06:43.033
CAMERAS STEPPING INTO WHAT

06:43.100 --> 06:44.033
TURKISH AUTHORITIES BELIEVE WAS

06:44.100 --> 06:45.066
A DEATH TRAP.

06:45.133 --> 06:45.967
TURKISH AUTHORITIES HAVE

06:46.066 --> 06:47.433
IDENTIFIED 15 SAUDI MEN AS

06:47.500 --> 06:48.266
PERSONS OF INTEREST.

06:48.333 --> 06:49.600
ONLY HOURS BEFORE KHASHOGGI WENT

06:49.667 --> 06:50.834
MISSING, SEVERAL OF THEM WERE

06:50.900 --> 06:52.166
CAUGHT ON CAMERA ARRIVING IN

06:52.233 --> 06:53.567
ISTANBUL.

06:53.633 --> 06:54.867
A TURKISH OFFICIAL TELLS "THE

06:54.934 --> 06:56.767
NEW YORK TIMES" SAUDI AGENTS HAD

06:56.834 --> 06:58.066
DISMEMBERED HIS BODY WITH A BONE

06:58.133 --> 06:59.367
SAW THEY BROUGHT FOR THE

06:59.433 --> 07:02.100
PURPOSE.

07:02.166 --> 07:02.934
>> John: IT'S ABSOLUTELY

07:03.000 --> 07:04.033
HORRIFIC, AND THE SAUDIS DENY IT

07:04.100 --> 07:08.667
HAPPENED.

07:08.734 --> 07:10.633
ALTHOUGH LET US ALL AGREE ON

07:10.700 --> 07:12.400
THIS, A BONE SAW, IN ANY

07:12.467 --> 07:12.967
CONTEXT, IS AN IMMEDIATE RED

07:13.033 --> 07:13.567
FLAG.

07:13.633 --> 07:14.233
"THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME

07:14.300 --> 07:15.600
OVER FOR THANKSGIVING, CRAIG.

07:15.667 --> 07:16.367
THE TURKEY IS DELICIOUS, THE

07:16.433 --> 07:16.967
STUFFING IS PERFECT, THAT'S A

07:17.033 --> 07:17.600
VERY LARGE BONE SAW, AND I JUST

07:17.667 --> 07:21.633
REMEMBERED I HAVE TO LEAVE."

07:21.700 --> 07:23.800
NOW, SAUDI OFFICIALS HAVE

07:23.867 --> 07:25.100
SCRAMBLED TO EXPLAIN ALL THE

07:25.166 --> 07:26.333
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY SURROUNDING

07:26.400 --> 07:27.166
HIS DISAPPEARANCE, WITH THE

07:27.233 --> 07:28.000
SAUDI-OWNED CHANNEL AL ARABIYA

07:28.066 --> 07:28.767
CLAIMING THAT THE 15 PEOPLE WHO

07:28.834 --> 07:31.266
TURNED UP IN ISTANBUL

07:31.333 --> 07:32.367
WERE JUST TOURISTS, WHICH IS

07:32.433 --> 07:33.633
CLEARLY BULLSHIT, GIVEN THAT

07:33.700 --> 07:35.033
FLIGHT LOGS SHOWED THAT MOST OF

07:35.100 --> 07:36.734
THE MEN ARRIVED ON A PRIVATE

07:36.800 --> 07:38.667
CHARTER PLANE AT 3:13 A.M. AND

07:38.734 --> 07:40.266
THAT ALL OF THEM DEPARTED THE

07:40.333 --> 07:41.066
SAME DAY THEY ARRIVED, WHICH IS

07:41.133 --> 07:46.567
A PRETTY WEIRD VACATION.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.533
"I WANT TO SEE ISTANBUL, BUT

07:47.600 --> 07:48.533
ONLY FOR A FEW HOURS, MOSTLY AT

07:48.600 --> 07:49.667
NIGHT, AND I NEED TO BRING MY

07:49.767 --> 07:51.266
BONE SAW."

07:51.333 --> 07:52.367
ALSO, THE WHOLE "WE WERE JUST

07:52.433 --> 07:53.600
TOURISTS" EXCUSE ISN'T EVEN A

07:53.667 --> 07:54.800
NEW ONE.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.133
IN THE WAKE OF RUSSIA'S

07:56.200 --> 07:57.200
POISONING OF SERGEI SKRIPAL, THE

07:57.266 --> 07:58.066
RUSSIAN SUSPECTS TRIED THE SAME

07:58.133 --> 07:59.266
THING.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.800
>> WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

08:01.867 --> 08:03.533
>> OUR FRIENDS HAD BEEN

08:03.600 --> 08:04.633
SUGGESTING FOR A LONG TIME THAT

08:04.700 --> 08:09.033
WE VISIT THIS WONDERFUL TOWN.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.367
>> SALISBURY?

08:10.433 --> 08:11.600
A WONDERFUL TOWN?

08:11.667 --> 08:15.900
>> YES.

08:15.967 --> 08:17.500
THERE'S THE FAMOUS

08:17.567 --> 08:19.600
SALISBURY CATHEDRAL, FAMOUS NOT

08:19.667 --> 08:21.133
ONLY IN EUROPE BUT IN THE WHOLE

08:21.200 --> 08:21.333
WORLD.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.166
IT'S FAMOUS FOR ITS 123-METER

08:22.233 --> 08:23.567
SPIRE.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.400
IT'S FAMOUS FOR ITS CLOCK, THE

08:26.467 --> 08:27.967
ONE OF THE FIRST EVER CREATED IN

08:28.033 --> 08:29.400
THE WORLD THAT'S STILL WORKING.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.934
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST, I LOVE

08:30.967 --> 08:33.867
HOW THE REPORTER IMMEDIATELY

08:33.934 --> 08:37.133
BECAME SUSPICIOUS WHEN THEY

08:37.200 --> 08:37.800
CALLED SALISBURY

08:37.867 --> 08:38.633
"A WONDERFUL TOWN."

08:38.700 --> 08:39.533
SHE KNOWS WHAT'S UP.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.266
IT'S LIKE IF YOU HEARD SOMEONE

08:40.333 --> 08:41.066
CALL CELERY "A DELICIOUS TREAT."

08:41.133 --> 08:41.834
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE

08:41.900 --> 08:42.600
YOU'RE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH

08:42.667 --> 08:43.934
ABOUT, BUT NOW I DEFINITELY KNOW

08:44.000 --> 08:45.100
YOU'RE A FUCKING LIAR.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.233
AND SECOND, IT'S FAMOUS FOR ITS

08:46.300 --> 08:48.834
123

08:48.900 --> 08:50.100
THEY SOUND LIKE THEY'RE READING

08:50.166 --> 08:51.266
DIRECTLY OFF THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE

08:51.333 --> 08:52.600
FOR SALISBURY.

08:55.433 --> 08:56.266
"OH, WHY DO I LOVE SALISBURY?

08:56.333 --> 08:57.367
SIMPLE.

08:57.433 --> 08:58.867
THE POPULATION IS 40,302, AND

08:58.934 --> 09:00.233
THEIR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IS

09:00.300 --> 09:01.900
JOHN GLEN, A CONSERVATIVE WHOSE

09:01.967 --> 09:06.100
EIGHT-YEAR TENURE HAS WIDELY

09:06.166 --> 09:07.400
BEEN VIEWED AS A FAILURE.

09:07.467 --> 09:08.934
OPEN BRACKETS, CITATION NEEDED,

09:09.000 --> 09:14.967
CLOSE BRACKETS."

09:15.033 --> 09:16.300
BUT, LOOK, FOR ALL THE SAUDI

09:16.367 --> 09:17.867
DENIALS, THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING

09:17.934 --> 09:18.600
GOOD RIGHT NOW, AS THE TURKISH

09:18.667 --> 09:19.367
GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY HAVE AUDIO

09:19.433 --> 09:20.300
AND VIDEO PROOF OF THE

09:20.367 --> 09:22.000
ASSASSINATION.

09:22.066 --> 09:23.533
LOOK, THIS STORY IS INCREDIBLY

09:23.600 --> 09:26.567
GRIM, BECAUSE WHILE THIS MAY BE

09:26.600 --> 09:27.300
THE FIRST THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF

09:27.333 --> 09:28.333
JAMAL KHASHOGGI, HE'S LONG BEEN

09:28.400 --> 09:29.633
A SIGNIFICANT FIGURE IN

09:29.700 --> 09:31.200
SAUDI ARABIA, A THOUGHTFUL AND

09:31.266 --> 09:31.867
BY NO MEANS RADICAL CRITIC OF

09:31.967 --> 09:37.734
THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.600
AND THIS IS ALL WORRYING,

09:38.667 --> 09:39.500
BECAUSE THE ONLY REASON TO KILL

09:39.567 --> 09:40.700
A JOURNALIST IN YOUR OWN

09:40.767 --> 09:41.400
CONSULATE WITH 15 PEOPLE AND A

09:41.467 --> 09:42.467
BONE SAW YOU FLEW IN THAT DAY IS

09:42.533 --> 09:43.567
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEND A

09:43.633 --> 09:44.700
MESSAGE AND YOU WERE SURE YOU

09:44.767 --> 09:45.767
COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

09:45.834 --> 09:46.967
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION: WHY

09:47.066 --> 09:48.934
WOULD THEY BE SO SURE OF THAT?

09:48.967 --> 09:49.967
AND PART OF THAT ANSWER MAY HAVE

09:50.033 --> 09:51.700
TO DO WITH US.

09:51.767 --> 09:52.734
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

09:52.800 --> 09:53.867
AMERICA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH

09:53.934 --> 09:55.600
SAUDI ARABIA.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.100
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG AND

09:57.166 --> 10:02.066
MORALLY COMPROMISED HISTORY.

10:02.133 --> 10:02.934
IN SHORT, IN VERY SHORT,

10:02.967 --> 10:03.734
FOR DECADES, WE'VE HAD

10:03.800 --> 10:04.467
A RELATIONSHIP BASED ON

10:04.533 --> 10:05.433
STRATEGIC INTERESTS, NOT SHARED

10:05.500 --> 10:06.367
VALUES.

10:06.433 --> 10:07.967
THEY HAVE OIL, WE NEED IT.

10:08.066 --> 10:08.934
THEY OPPOSED IRAN, AND SO DID

10:08.967 --> 10:10.300
WE.

10:10.367 --> 10:11.533
AND FOR THOSE AND OTHER REASONS,

10:11.600 --> 10:12.800
U.S. PRESIDENTS HAVE, TO VARYING

10:12.867 --> 10:14.367
DEGREES, BEEN WILLING TO PANDER

10:14.433 --> 10:15.633
TO SAUDI ARABIA.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.567
AND IN DOING SO, WE'VE

10:16.633 --> 10:19.200
CONVENIENTLY TURNED A BLIND EYE

10:19.266 --> 10:20.300
TO A LOT OF THINGS, FROM HUMAN

10:20.367 --> 10:21.867
RIGHTS ABUSES TO THE SAUDI

10:21.934 --> 10:23.200
LEADERSHIP'S ROLE IN FUNDING

10:23.266 --> 10:24.633
RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM, EVEN WHILE

10:24.700 --> 10:26.433
PARTNERING WITH US TO FIGHT IT.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.767
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A COMPLICATED

10:28.834 --> 10:30.166
RELATIONSHIP, BUT IN THE LAST

10:30.233 --> 10:32.834
COUPLE OF YEARS, IT'S GOTTEN

10:32.900 --> 10:34.400
SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER, THANKS TO

10:34.467 --> 10:36.066
TWO NEW LEADERS: TRUMP AND CROWN

10:36.133 --> 10:39.600
PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN.

10:39.667 --> 10:40.700
AND LET'S TAKE THE PRINCE FIRST.

10:40.767 --> 10:41.800
THOUGH HIS FATHER, THE KING, IS

10:41.867 --> 10:43.800
STILL ALIVE, SINCE LAST YEAR,

10:43.867 --> 10:47.066
THE PRINCE HAS EFFECTIVELY BEEN

10:47.133 --> 10:48.333
RUNNING THE COUNTRY AND HAS

10:48.400 --> 10:49.767
BRANDED HIMSELF AS "MBS," THE

10:49.834 --> 10:53.333
YOUNG, NEW FACE OF SAUDI ARABIA.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.333
HE MADE THE COVER OF "TIME"

10:56.400 --> 10:57.133
MAGAZINE UNDER THE HEADLINE

10:57.200 --> 10:58.166
"CHARM OFFENSIVE", AND

10:58.233 --> 10:58.900
"60 MINUTES" PROFILED HIM AS A

10:58.967 --> 10:59.800
PROGRESSIVE VOICE FOR THE

10:59.867 --> 11:01.133
COUNTRY.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.367
>> HIS REFORMS INSIDE

11:02.433 --> 11:02.967
SAUDI ARABIA HAVE BEEN

11:03.033 --> 11:04.166
REVOLUTIONARY.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.200
HE IS EMANCIPATING WOMEN,

11:06.266 --> 11:07.834
INTRODUCING MUSIC AND CINEMA,

11:07.900 --> 11:08.500
AND CRACKING DOWN ON CORRUPTION.

11:08.533 --> 11:09.767
>> John: NOW, THERE IS SOME

11:09.834 --> 11:11.433
TRUTH TO THAT.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.300
HE'S ATTEMPTED TO REDUCE THE

11:13.367 --> 11:14.500
INFLUENCE OF SOME HARD-LINE

11:14.567 --> 11:16.033
CLERICS, HE HAS AGREED TO LET

11:16.100 --> 11:17.967
WOMEN DRIVE, AND HE'S ALLOWED

11:18.033 --> 11:18.567
MOVIE THEATERS AFTER A

11:18.633 --> 11:19.567
35-YEAR BAN.

11:19.633 --> 11:20.400
ALTHOUGH I WILL NOTE THAT ONE OF

11:20.467 --> 11:21.166
THE VERY FIRST MOVIES THEY

11:21.233 --> 11:22.967
SHOWED THERE WAS -- AND THIS IS

11:23.033 --> 11:24.266
TRUE -- "THE EMOJI MOVIE,"

11:24.333 --> 11:25.467
WHICH, IN HINDSIGHT, IS ACTUALLY

11:25.533 --> 11:26.600
HOW IT WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE

11:26.667 --> 11:27.734
SEEN: BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO

11:27.800 --> 11:28.667
HAD NEVER SEEN A GOOD MOVIE TO

11:28.734 --> 11:35.900
COMPARE IT TO.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.233
NOW ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN

11:37.300 --> 11:38.800
COMBINED WITH A MAJOR PLAN TO

11:38.867 --> 11:40.567
RE-ORIENT THE SAUDI ECONOMY AWAY

11:40.633 --> 11:41.667
FROM OIL AND TOWARD TECHNOLOGY

11:41.734 --> 11:44.500
CALLED "VISION 2030."

11:44.567 --> 11:46.734
TO THAT END, MBS HAS GONE ON A

11:46.800 --> 11:48.200
WORLD TOUR THIS YEAR TO

11:48.266 --> 11:49.433
REASSURE INVESTORS THAT

11:49.500 --> 11:50.867
SAUDI ARABIA IS STABLE AND

11:50.934 --> 11:52.033
PROGRESSIVE AND THAT BUSINESS

11:52.100 --> 11:52.667
SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WORKING

11:52.734 --> 11:53.433
WITH THEM.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.900
HE'S TAKEN MEETINGS WITH

11:54.967 --> 11:56.467
TIM COOK, BILL GATES, AND

11:56.533 --> 11:58.233
RICHARD BRANSON, AND HAD

11:58.300 --> 11:58.800
STARBUCKS WITH

11:58.867 --> 11:59.567
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG.

11:59.633 --> 12:00.300
INCIDENTALLY, WHILE THE

12:00.367 --> 12:01.200
STARBUCKS BARISTAS MIRACULOUSLY

12:01.266 --> 12:02.233
NAILED "MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN,"

12:02.300 --> 12:04.200
BLOOMBERG STILL ENDED UP WITH A

12:04.266 --> 12:08.333
CUP READING "MIKEY BOOM-BURP."

12:08.400 --> 12:10.233
NOW, AS PART OF HIS PR PUSH, MBS

12:10.300 --> 12:12.967
STARTED AN ANNUAL BUSINESS

12:13.033 --> 12:15.367
CONFERENCE CALLED "THE FUTURE

12:15.433 --> 12:16.166
INVESTMENT INITIATIVE," OR AS

12:16.233 --> 12:17.033
IT'S KNOWN, "DAVOS IN THE

12:17.100 --> 12:19.600
DESERT."

12:19.667 --> 12:21.200
THE FIRST ONE WAS HELD JUST LAST

12:21.266 --> 12:22.533
YEAR AT THE RITZ-CARLTON IN

12:22.600 --> 12:24.266
RIYADH FEATURING LEADERS OF

12:24.333 --> 12:25.000
MANY BIG-NAME COMPANIES AS WELL

12:25.066 --> 12:25.834
AS THE USUAL FUTURISTIC TECH

12:25.900 --> 12:27.567
BULLSHIT LIKE THIS:

12:27.633 --> 12:28.400
>> WE HAVE SMART INVESTORS HERE

12:28.467 --> 12:29.200
AND THEY ARE VERY SELECTIVE

12:29.266 --> 12:31.333
ABOUT WHAT THEY INVEST IN.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.900
>> WELL, I THINK I'M SPECIAL.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.700
I CAN USE MY EXPRESSIVE FACE TO

12:35.767 --> 12:40.867
COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.533
>> BUT WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR

12:42.600 --> 12:45.934
YOU TO HAVE AN EXPRESSIVE FACE?

12:46.000 --> 12:46.600
>> MOST OF THE TIME I FEEL

12:46.667 --> 12:51.033
POSITIVE.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.367
>> John: OH, GOD.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.033
OH, GOD.

12:54.100 --> 12:54.734
THAT IS A CREEPY SMILE.

12:54.767 --> 12:55.567
THAT'S THE EXACT SMILE I'VE SEEN

12:55.633 --> 12:56.200
THE QUEEN GIVE WHEN SHE HAS TO

12:56.266 --> 12:56.967
INTERACT WITH A COMMONER.

12:57.033 --> 12:57.633
"I BELIEVE YOU WON SOME KIND OF

12:57.700 --> 12:58.300
CONTEST TO COME TO MY HOUSE AND

12:58.367 --> 12:59.133
LOOK AT MY THINGS.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.433
WHAT A POSITIVE DAY FOR ONE OF

13:00.500 --> 13:06.967
US."

13:07.066 --> 13:09.400
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING."

13:09.467 --> 13:10.066
BUT MBS'S PR PUSH ISN'T JUST

13:10.133 --> 13:14.500
TOWARD ATTRACTING BUSINESSES.

13:14.567 --> 13:16.633
IT'S ALSO TOWARD CHANGING THE

13:16.700 --> 13:17.133
WORLD'S PERCEPTION OF

13:17.200 --> 13:17.734
SAUDI ARABIA.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.233
TO THAT END, HE STRUCK A

13:18.300 --> 13:18.867
TEN-YEAR DEAL WITH ONE OF THE

13:18.934 --> 13:19.500
MOST POPULAR AMERICAN FRANCHISES

13:19.567 --> 13:22.700
THERE IS, WORLD WRESTLING

13:22.767 --> 13:23.367
ENTERTAINMENT OR WWE.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.600
THEY HELD THEIR FIRST OF MANY

13:24.667 --> 13:25.266
EVENTS THERE IN APRIL, AND

13:25.333 --> 13:25.900
AUDIENCES AROUND THE WORLD WERE

13:25.967 --> 13:26.934
TREATED TO WALL-TO-WALL

13:26.967 --> 13:28.367
PROPAGANDA ABOUT THE NEW

13:28.433 --> 13:29.667
SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDING A VIDEO

13:29.734 --> 13:31.934
SHOWING WOMEN HAPPILY DRIVING,

13:31.967 --> 13:33.166
MEN DANCING, AND TOURIST

13:33.233 --> 13:34.233
DESTINATION BEAUTY SHOTS, AS

13:34.300 --> 13:35.200
WELL AS CONSTANT EXCITED

13:35.266 --> 13:36.433
COMPLIMENTS THROUGHOUT THE

13:36.500 --> 13:38.800
BROADCAST.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.233
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME, WWE

13:40.300 --> 13:43.166
BRINGING AN EVENT OF THIS

13:43.233 --> 13:44.300
MAGNITUDE TO SAUDI ARABIA.

13:44.367 --> 13:45.233
>> THIS VIBRANT, PROGRESSIVE

13:45.300 --> 13:46.667
CITY, OUR HOST TONIGHT.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.867
>> IT'S ALL PART, OF COURSE, OF

13:48.934 --> 13:50.934
THE SAUDI VISION 2030.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.333
>> KING ABDULLAH'S SPORTS CITY

13:52.400 --> 13:54.000
STADIUM JUST GOT ON ITS FEET.

13:54.066 --> 13:56.233
>> THAT AREA HAS BEEN RESERVED

13:56.300 --> 13:58.033
FOR THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY, THE

13:58.100 --> 13:58.767
HOUSE OF THE SAUD.

13:58.834 --> 14:01.200
>> I WANT TO SEND A GENUINE

14:01.266 --> 14:01.767
THANK YOU TO THE KINGDOM OF

14:01.834 --> 14:02.967
SAUDI ARABIA.

14:03.033 --> 14:04.100
>> John: WOW.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.000
IT SEEMS THE WWE IS AS OVERTLY

14:06.066 --> 14:11.867
PRO-SAUDI ARABIA AS IT IS

14:11.934 --> 14:13.667
LATENTLY HOMOEROTIC.

14:13.734 --> 14:15.367
WHICH IS TO SAY: INTENSELY.

14:15.433 --> 14:16.834
BUT THE TRUTH IS, MBS IS FAR

14:16.900 --> 14:18.467
FROM THE POLITICAL REFORMER THAT

14:18.533 --> 14:20.233
HE'S BEEN PRESENTED AS.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.400
IN FACT, SCRATCH ANY POSITIVE

14:21.467 --> 14:23.033
STORY ABOUT HIM, AND YOU'LL FIND

14:23.100 --> 14:24.633
A MUCH GRIMMER TRUTH UNDERNEATH.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.233
FOR INSTANCE, WHILE THE COUNTRY

14:26.300 --> 14:27.834
DID GET HEADLINES FOR ENDING ITS

14:27.900 --> 14:30.000
BAN ON WOMEN DRIVING, JUST WEEKS

14:30.066 --> 14:31.800
BEFORE, AUTHORITIES ARRESTED

14:31.867 --> 14:33.600
ABOUT A DOZEN FEMALE ACTIVISTS

14:33.667 --> 14:35.233
WHO'D CAMPAIGNED FOR THE RIGHT

14:35.333 --> 14:36.800
TO DRIVE.

14:36.867 --> 14:38.166
EVEN THAT INVESTMENT CONFERENCE

14:38.233 --> 14:44.667
HAD A DARK CODA, BECAUSE JUST

14:44.734 --> 14:46.033
ONE WEEK LATER, AT THE EXACT

14:46.100 --> 14:47.467
SAME HOTEL, THIS HAPPENED:

14:47.533 --> 14:48.800
>> NEW FOOTAGE FROM INSIDE THE

14:48.867 --> 14:50.266
RITZ-CARLTON HOTEL IN

14:50.333 --> 14:51.834
SAUDI ARABIA'S CAPITAL, RIYADH,

14:51.900 --> 14:53.233
SHOWS A DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION

14:53.300 --> 14:53.900
FROM A FAVORITE HAUNT OF THE

14:53.967 --> 14:54.934
WELL-HEELED INTO ARGUABLY THE

14:54.967 --> 14:56.400
WORLD'S MOST LUXURIOUS PRISON.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.533
>> John: IT'S TRUE, MBS USED

14:57.600 --> 14:58.533
THAT RITZ-CARLTON TO LOCK UP

14:58.600 --> 14:59.734
HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSMEN AND

14:59.800 --> 15:00.967
MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY IN A

15:01.033 --> 15:02.100
SO-CALLED ANTI-CORRUPTION

15:02.166 --> 15:04.600
CAMPAIGN.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.367
AT LEAST 17 DETAINEES WERE

15:07.433 --> 15:10.300
REPORTEDLY HOSPITALIZED FOR

15:10.367 --> 15:11.934
PHYSICAL ABUSE AND ONE SAUDI

15:11.967 --> 15:13.600
MILITARY OFFICER DIED IN

15:13.667 --> 15:14.166
CUSTODY, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

15:14.233 --> 15:15.166
INSANE AND HORRIFYING,

15:15.233 --> 15:16.033
BECAUSE THE ONLY HOTEL WHERE YOU

15:16.100 --> 15:16.533
EXPECT TO BE MURDERED IS

15:16.600 --> 15:18.633
A DAYS INN.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.467
HENCE THEIR SLOGAN,

15:19.533 --> 15:20.467
"DAYS INN --

15:20.533 --> 15:22.166
EXPECT TO BE MURDERED HERE."

15:22.233 --> 15:23.600
MEANWHILE, BIN SALMAN HAS BEEN

15:23.667 --> 15:24.734
AGGRESSIVE WITH HIS NEIGHBORS,

15:24.800 --> 15:25.800
LAUNCHING A BLOCKADE OF QATAR

15:25.867 --> 15:27.033
LAST YEAR THAT CONTINUES TO THIS

15:27.100 --> 15:28.767
DAY, AS DOES AN ABSOLUTELY

15:28.834 --> 15:30.300
BRUTAL WAR IN YEMEN THAT'S

15:30.367 --> 15:32.367
RESULTED IN OVER 16,000

15:32.433 --> 15:33.600
CASUALTIES AND KILLED OVER 1200

15:33.667 --> 15:36.033
CHILDREN.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.633
THE SAUDI CAMPAIGN OF AIRSTRIKES

15:37.700 --> 15:38.867
HAS BEEN CATASTROPHIC, AS THIS

15:38.934 --> 15:39.934
MAN ATTESTED WHILE STANDING IN

15:40.000 --> 15:40.900
FRONT OF WHAT USED TO BE HIS

15:40.967 --> 15:41.934
HOME.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.700
>> SAUDI ARABIA BOMBS WITHOUT

15:42.767 --> 15:46.233
CARE.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.000
>> HOW MANY OF YOUR FAMILY WERE

15:47.066 --> 15:47.834
KILLED?

15:47.900 --> 15:48.533
>> 27 LIVES.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.400
27 PEOPLE.

15:49.467 --> 15:56.166
FROM ONE FAMILY.

15:56.233 --> 15:57.233
>> CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON

15:57.300 --> 15:57.934
WHY YOUR FAMILY AND THIS HOUSE

15:58.000 --> 15:58.433
MIGHT HAVE BEEN STRUCK?

15:58.500 --> 15:58.934
>> I AM NOT A LEADER OR

15:59.000 --> 15:59.934
ANYTHING.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.667
I WORK AS A BARBER.

16:00.734 --> 16:01.433
>> John: THAT'S CLEARLY

16:01.500 --> 16:02.266
TERRIBLE.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.233
AND FOR THE RECORD, AT THE VERY

16:03.300 --> 16:04.200
LEAST, THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION

16:04.266 --> 16:05.433
FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST A BARBER.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.333
AND THAT IS COMING FROM ME.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.600
IF ANYONE HAS JUSTIFICATION FOR

16:11.667 --> 16:12.967
A BLOOD GRUDGE AGAINST BARBERS,

16:13.033 --> 16:15.333
IT WOULD BE YOURS TRULY BECAUSE

16:15.367 --> 16:20.066
OF WHAT THEY DID TO ME.

16:20.133 --> 16:23.400
AND YET -- AND YET AS ALL OF

16:23.467 --> 16:24.500
THIS HAS HAPPENED, OUR CURRENT

16:24.567 --> 16:25.867
PRESIDENT HAS CONTINUED TO BEND

16:25.934 --> 16:27.333
OVER BACKWARDS TO ACCOMMODATE

16:27.400 --> 16:29.133
AND IGNORE BIN SALMAN'S WORST

16:29.200 --> 16:30.100
EXCESSES, AND SOMETIMES EVEN

16:30.166 --> 16:32.100
CELEBRATE THEM.

16:32.166 --> 16:34.133
AFTER THAT CLAMPDOWN ON

16:34.200 --> 16:36.800
CORRUPTION AT THE RITZ-CARLTON,

16:36.867 --> 16:37.433
MANY AROUND THE WORLD SOUNDED

16:37.500 --> 16:38.133
ALARM.

16:38.200 --> 16:38.967
BUT TRUMP WENT THE OTHER WAY.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.200
>> TRUMP ENDORSED CROWN PRINCE

16:40.266 --> 16:41.500
MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN'S NEW

16:41.567 --> 16:42.934
CORRUPTION CRACKDOWN, TWEETING,

16:42.967 --> 16:44.066
"I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN

16:44.133 --> 16:45.967
KING SALMAN AND THE CROWN PRINCE

16:46.033 --> 16:47.367
OF SAUDI ARABIA.

16:47.433 --> 16:48.367
THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE

16:48.433 --> 16:50.834
DOING."

16:50.900 --> 16:52.100
>> John: RIGHT, BUT JUST BECAUSE

16:52.166 --> 16:53.433
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING

16:53.500 --> 16:54.033
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WHAT THEY'RE

16:54.100 --> 16:55.800
DOING IS GOOD.

16:55.867 --> 16:56.934
MICHAEL JORDAN KNEW EXACTLY WHAT

16:56.967 --> 16:58.200
HE WAS DOING WHEN HE WORE THIS

16:58.266 --> 17:01.100
MUSTACHE IN A HANES COMMERCIAL.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.467
HE WAS SEEING HOW FAR THIS WHOLE

17:03.533 --> 17:05.800
MICHAEL JORDAN THING COULD TAKE

17:05.867 --> 17:08.633
HIM, AND THE ANSWER WAS

17:08.700 --> 17:09.633
APPARENTLY THROUGH HITLER AND

17:09.700 --> 17:09.900
BEYOND.

17:09.967 --> 17:10.767
AND THAT FITS WITH THE LARGER

17:10.867 --> 17:11.767
PATTERN OF DONALD TRUMP AND

17:11.834 --> 17:12.633
SAUDI ARABIA, 'CAUSE SINCE

17:12.700 --> 17:14.433
TAKING OFFICE, HE HAS CATERED TO

17:14.500 --> 17:16.800
THEM AT EVERY TURN.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.033
HE MADE SAUDI ARABIA THE

17:18.100 --> 17:19.800
FIRST FOREIGN COUNTRY HE VISITED

17:19.867 --> 17:21.567
AS PRESIDENT, AND HE SEEMED TO

17:21.633 --> 17:25.867
HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT TIME

17:25.934 --> 17:26.500
THERE, DANCING WITH A SWORD AND

17:26.567 --> 17:27.567
FAMOUSLY GROPING A WEIRD GLOWING

17:27.633 --> 17:28.767
ORB, AFTER WHICH I ASSUME

17:28.834 --> 17:30.333
MICHAEL COHEN INSTINCTIVELY

17:30.400 --> 17:31.700
OFFERED THE ORB $130,000 AND

17:31.767 --> 17:38.867
TOLD IT TO KEEP QUIET.

17:38.934 --> 17:44.333
AND, LOOK, IT REALLY SHOULDN'T

17:44.400 --> 17:45.567
BE THAT SURPRISING THAT TRUMP

17:45.633 --> 17:46.834
HAS SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACED

17:46.900 --> 17:47.333
THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.000
THEY HAVE THE TWO QUALITIES HE

17:48.066 --> 17:49.000
ADMIRES MOST IN THE WORLD:

17:49.066 --> 17:49.633
HAVING A LOT OF MONEY AND GIVING

17:49.700 --> 17:50.233
IT TO HIM.

17:50.300 --> 17:50.967
HE BASICALLY SAID AS MUCH ON THE

17:51.033 --> 17:51.600
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

17:51.667 --> 17:52.300
>> SAUDI ARABIA.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.066
AND I GET ALONG GREAT WITH ALL

17:53.133 --> 17:53.767
OF THEM.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.433
THEY BUY APARTMENTS FROM ME.

17:55.500 --> 17:55.967
THEY SPEND $40 MILLION,

17:56.033 --> 17:56.900
$50 MILLION.

17:56.967 --> 17:57.967
AM I SUPPOSED TO DISLIKE THEM?

17:58.033 --> 17:59.400
I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.600
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE.

18:01.667 --> 18:02.633
BUYING AN APARTMENT FROM TRUMP

18:02.700 --> 18:03.934
IS A SUREFIRE WAY TO GET HIM TO

18:03.967 --> 18:05.567
LIKE YOU, ALONG WITH WEARING ONE

18:05.633 --> 18:06.934
OF HIS HATS, BEING UNDER

18:06.967 --> 18:09.467
25 YEARS OLD WITH A SIZE 32DD,

18:09.533 --> 18:12.033
AND NOT BEING ERIC.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.333
HE'S A SIMPLE MAN WITH SIMPLE

18:13.400 --> 18:16.233
TASTES.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.300
AND TRUMP'S BUSINESSMAN VIEW OF

18:18.367 --> 18:20.100
THE SAUDIS AS JUST "PEOPLE WITH

18:20.166 --> 18:21.066
MONEY, DON'T ASK TOO MANY

18:21.133 --> 18:22.400
QUESTIONS" HAS CARRIED OVER NOW

18:22.467 --> 18:23.834
THAT HE'S PRESIDENT.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.500
WHEN BIN SALMAN CAME TO THE

18:25.567 --> 18:26.300
WHITE HOUSE, TRUMP CALLED A

18:26.367 --> 18:28.467
PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE

18:28.533 --> 18:29.900
OVAL OFFICE WHERE HE BOASTED

18:29.967 --> 18:30.867
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ARMS THAT

18:30.934 --> 18:31.867
THEY WERE BUYING FROM US,

18:31.934 --> 18:32.900
ESSENTIALLY USING MBS AS A

18:32.967 --> 18:34.867
HUMAN EASEL.

18:34.934 --> 18:36.300
>> SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE

18:36.367 --> 18:37.934
BEEN APPROVED AND ARE CURRENTLY

18:37.967 --> 18:39.433
UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WILL BE

18:39.500 --> 18:41.200
DELIVERED TO SAUDI ARABIA VERY

18:41.266 --> 18:43.266
SOON, AND THAT'S FOR THEIR

18:43.333 --> 18:47.367
PROTECTION, BUT IF YOU LOOK, IN

18:47.433 --> 18:49.934
TERMS OF DOLLARS, $3 BILLION,

18:50.000 --> 18:55.066
$533 MILLION, $525 MILLION,

18:55.133 --> 18:56.600
THAT'S PEANUTS TO YOU GUYS.

18:56.667 --> 18:57.934
>>

18:58.000 --> 19:00.867
>> SHOULD HAVE INCREASED IT.

19:00.934 --> 19:05.800
$880 MILLION, $645 MILLION.

19:05.867 --> 19:07.266
$6 BILLION, THAT'S FOR FRIGATES.

19:07.333 --> 19:12.200
>>

19:12.266 --> 19:13.633
>> John: FIRST, FIRST, HAS ANY

19:13.700 --> 19:15.300
HUMAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE

19:15.367 --> 19:16.800
WORLD MORE OBVIOUSLY JUST

19:16.867 --> 19:18.266
LEARNED A WORD THAN HE JUST

19:18.333 --> 19:18.967
LEARNED THE WORD "FRIGATES"?

19:19.033 --> 19:19.800
"FRIGATES!"

19:19.867 --> 19:24.567
BUT SECOND, LOOK AT BIN SALMAN'S

19:24.633 --> 19:25.900
FACE THERE AS IT HITS HIM JUST

19:25.967 --> 19:26.934
HOW MUCH TRUMP LIKES MONEY.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.433
IT'S LIKE THE FACE OF A

19:27.500 --> 19:28.166
BABYSITTER WHO REALIZED YOU CAN

19:28.233 --> 19:28.900
PACIFY A SCREAMING KID WITH

19:28.967 --> 19:29.700
TWIZZLERS.

19:29.767 --> 19:30.467
"OH, I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO

19:30.533 --> 19:31.400
BE DIFFICULT, BUT IF ALL YOU

19:31.467 --> 19:32.233
WANT IS TWIZZLERS, I'VE GOT

19:32.300 --> 19:33.233
LOADS OF THEM.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.900
HERE, TAKE ALL YOU WANT AND SHUT

19:34.967 --> 19:36.834
THE FUCK UP."

19:36.900 --> 19:38.433
AND LOOK, LOOK, I AM BY NO MEANS

19:38.500 --> 19:40.300
SAYING THAT TRUMP IS THE FIRST

19:40.333 --> 19:41.967
U.S. PRESIDENT TO MAKE

19:42.033 --> 19:43.467
DISTASTEFUL ARMS DEALS WITH THE

19:43.533 --> 19:45.467
SAUDIS.

19:45.533 --> 19:46.600
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR DECADES.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.100
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION STILL

19:48.166 --> 19:49.500
SOLD THEM WEAPONS EVEN AS

19:49.567 --> 19:50.867
SAUDI ARABIA GOT INVOLVED IN

19:50.934 --> 19:53.066
YEMEN.

19:53.133 --> 19:55.166
BUT TRUMP HAS CONTINUED DOING SO

19:55.233 --> 19:56.500
EVEN AS SIGNS MOUNT OF SAUDI

19:56.567 --> 19:58.100
RECKLESSNESS IN AIR STRIKES.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.033
TWO MONTHS AGO, THEY DROPPED AN

20:00.100 --> 20:00.633
AMERICAN-MADE BOMB ON A SCHOOL

20:00.700 --> 20:06.333
BUS FULL OF CHILDREN, AN ACT

20:06.400 --> 20:09.467
-- BUT JUST A MONTH LATER, THEY

20:09.533 --> 20:12.900
SAID SAUDI ARABIA WAS

20:12.967 --> 20:13.700
DOING EVERYTHING IT COULD TO

20:13.767 --> 20:14.633
PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AND

20:14.700 --> 20:15.967
CARRIED ON SUPPORTING THEM.

20:16.033 --> 20:16.700
THE POINT IS, AT EVERY TURN,

20:16.767 --> 20:17.433
TRUMP HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO

20:17.500 --> 20:18.233
ACCOMMODATE THE SAUDIS.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.166
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN

20:19.233 --> 20:20.066
AMBASSADOR TO THE KINGDOM.

20:20.133 --> 20:21.433
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS

20:21.500 --> 20:23.100
BEING HANDLED PERSONALLY BY

20:23.166 --> 20:24.233
JARED, IVANKA TRUMP'S REAL DOLL.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.767
AND THE SAUDIS SEEM

20:26.834 --> 20:28.233
UNDERSTANDABLY VERY HAPPY WITH

20:28.300 --> 20:31.200
THAT SITUATION.

20:31.266 --> 20:34.033
>> KUSHNER TOOK AN UNEXPECTED

20:34.100 --> 20:35.200
TRIP TO SAUDI ARABIA IN 2017 TO

20:35.266 --> 20:36.767
MEET WITH THE YOUNG PRINCE.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.667
MONTHS LATER, MBS REPORTEDLY

20:38.734 --> 20:39.834
BOASTED THAT KUSHNER WAS, "IN

20:39.900 --> 20:40.734
HIS POCKET," WHICH BIN SALMAN

20:40.800 --> 20:42.467
DENIED.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.333
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE HE'S IN

20:43.400 --> 20:44.834
THEIR POCKET.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.133
HE'S FUCKING JARED.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.400
THAT FACE WAS BORN TO BE

20:48.467 --> 20:48.967
MANEUVERED INTO SOMEONE'S

20:49.033 --> 20:49.900
POCKET.

20:49.967 --> 20:50.867
HIS SECRET SERVICE NICKNAME IS

20:50.934 --> 20:52.000
PROBABLY "WALLET, KEYS, AND A

20:52.066 --> 20:54.867
LITTLE BIT OF LINT."

20:54.934 --> 20:56.000
SO WHILE THE FACT THAT THE U.S.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.066
HAS ENABLED SAUDI ARABIA IS

20:58.133 --> 21:00.400
NOTHING NEW, THE EXTENT TO WHICH

21:00.467 --> 21:01.800
TRUMP IS PRIORITIZING MONEY

21:01.867 --> 21:03.300
ABOVE ALL ELSE IS REALLY

21:03.367 --> 21:05.700
DANGEROUS.

21:05.767 --> 21:10.266
IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THEY'VE

21:10.333 --> 21:12.667
BEEN EMBOLDENED HERE?

21:12.734 --> 21:14.433
AFTER MBS'S ROUNDUP OF HIS

21:14.500 --> 21:14.967
RIVALS, TRUMP TWEETED HIS

21:15.033 --> 21:15.433
SUPPORT.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.133
AFTER HIS BLOCKADE OF QATAR,

21:16.200 --> 21:16.900
TRUMP FOR SOME REASON TOOK

21:16.967 --> 21:17.800
CREDIT FOR IT, AND THAT KIND OF

21:17.867 --> 21:21.133
SHIT HAS CONSEQUENCES.

21:21.200 --> 21:30.233
TIME AND AGAIN, TRUMP HAS

21:30.300 --> 21:32.066
CHOSEN EXTREME FRIENDLINESS

21:32.133 --> 21:33.600
WITH MBS, A LEADER WHO, IN THE

21:33.667 --> 21:34.667
WORDS OF ONE SAUDI CRITIC, HAS

21:34.734 --> 21:35.400
CREATED A CLIMATE OF

21:35.467 --> 21:36.133
FEAR AND INTIMIDATION, GOING ON

21:36.200 --> 21:36.934
TO SAY, WE SAUDIS DESERVE

21:36.967 --> 21:37.967
BETTER.

21:38.066 --> 21:38.934
THAT CRITIC WAS JAMAL KHASHOGGI,

21:38.967 --> 21:40.100
THE JOURNALIST WHO IS WIDELY

21:40.166 --> 21:40.734
THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN

21:40.800 --> 21:41.266
THE SAUDI CONSULATE.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.166
AND WHILE TRUMP HAS SAID THAT

21:42.233 --> 21:43.433
SAUDI ARABIA FACES SEVERE

21:43.500 --> 21:44.033
PUNISHMENT IF IT'S PROVEN THAT

21:44.100 --> 21:45.233
THEY WERE BEHIND THIS, DOES

21:45.300 --> 21:46.200
ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT'S

21:46.266 --> 21:47.200
SOMETHING HE'S COMMITTED TO?

21:47.266 --> 21:47.967
A MUCH MORE REVEALING RESPONSE

21:48.033 --> 21:49.233
CAME IN THE OVAL OFFICE AFTER

21:49.300 --> 21:49.734
THE NEWS OF KHASHOGGI'S

21:49.800 --> 21:50.934
DISAPPEARANCE BROKE.

21:50.967 --> 21:52.100
JUST WATCH HIM RENDER, IN REAL

21:52.166 --> 21:53.200
TIME, THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

21:53.266 --> 21:54.433
THAT HE WAS APPLYING TO THE

21:54.500 --> 21:56.633
SITUATION.

21:56.700 --> 22:00.400
>> AGAIN, THIS TOOK PLACE IN

22:00.467 --> 22:01.767
TURKEY, AND TO THE BEST OF OUR

22:01.834 --> 22:03.100
KNOWLEDGE, KHASHOGGI IS NOT A

22:03.166 --> 22:04.633
UNITED STATES CITIZEN.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.967
IS THAT RIGHT, OR -- IS THAT

22:06.066 --> 22:06.700
RIGHT?

22:06.767 --> 22:07.567
>> PERMANENT RESIDENT.

22:07.633 --> 22:08.533
>> HE'S A PERMANENT RESIDENT,

22:08.600 --> 22:09.433
OKAY.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.734
WE DON'T LIKE IT, JOHN, WE DON'T

22:10.800 --> 22:12.400
LIKE IT, AND WE DON'T LIKE IT

22:12.467 --> 22:14.100
EVEN A LITTLE BIT, BUT AS TO

22:14.166 --> 22:16.600
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD STOP A

22:16.667 --> 22:18.033
$110 BILLION FROM BEING SPENT IN

22:18.100 --> 22:19.867
THIS COUNTRY -- KNOWING THEY

22:19.934 --> 22:21.200
HAVE FOUR OR FIVE ALTERNATIVES,

22:21.266 --> 22:22.600
TWO VERY GOOD ALTERNATIVES --

22:22.667 --> 22:24.000
THAT WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO

22:24.066 --> 22:25.667
ME.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.533
>> John: HE'S OPENLY

22:27.600 --> 22:29.066
DEMONSTRATING TO THE ENTIRE

22:29.133 --> 22:30.533
WORLD -- AND TO SAUDI ARABIA

22:30.600 --> 22:31.900
SPECIFICALLY -- THAT ARMS DEAL,

22:31.967 --> 22:33.066
MORE IMPORTANT THAN BUTCHERED

22:33.133 --> 22:37.467
JOURNALIST.

22:37.533 --> 22:38.467
LOOK, CLEARLY, GIVING

22:38.533 --> 22:39.433
SAUDI ARABIA GREEN LIGHTS FOR

22:39.500 --> 22:40.467
TWO SOLID YEARS HAS HAD

22:40.533 --> 22:41.433
CONSEQUENCES, AND A LOT OF

22:41.500 --> 22:42.333
PEOPLE NOW HAVE SOME BIG

22:42.400 --> 22:43.333
DECISIONS TO MAKE.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.033
THE SECOND ANNUAL

22:44.100 --> 22:45.133
"DAVOS IN THE DESERT" BEGINS

22:45.200 --> 22:46.367
NINE DAYS FROM NOW, AND ALREADY,

22:46.433 --> 22:48.333
ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE

22:48.400 --> 22:49.633
PULLED OUT, ALTHOUGH AS OF RIGHT

22:49.700 --> 22:51.033
NOW, TREASURY SECRETARY

22:51.100 --> 22:52.266
STEVE MNUCHIN IS STILL PLANNING

22:52.333 --> 22:59.166
TO ATTEND, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.

22:59.233 --> 23:00.266
THE DESERT IS COMFORTABLY HOT

23:00.333 --> 23:01.300
ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT SMOKESHOW.

23:01.367 --> 23:01.600
AM I RIGHT?

23:01.667 --> 23:02.200
AM I RIGHT?

23:02.266 --> 23:03.233
SMOKESHOW.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.300
HE CAN GET IT.

23:06.367 --> 23:07.400
THAT'S A FUCK ME FACE.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.867
AM I RIGHT?

23:09.934 --> 23:12.166
AM I RIGHT ON THAT?

23:12.233 --> 23:14.266
NOW, AS FOR THE WWE, WHILE THEY

23:14.333 --> 23:17.200
SAY THEY'RE MONITORING THE

23:17.266 --> 23:17.867
SITUATION, THEIR GIGANTIC

23:17.934 --> 23:18.567
CROWN JEWEL EVENT IS STILL

23:18.633 --> 23:19.533
SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER, MEANING

23:19.600 --> 23:20.500
JOHN CENA COULD WELL BE BACK

23:20.567 --> 23:22.200
THERE DOING THIS, WHICH IN THIS

23:22.266 --> 23:23.333
CONTEXT WOULD MEAN "YOU DON'T

23:23.400 --> 23:30.233
SEE THESE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES."

23:30.300 --> 23:31.967
AS FOR THE PRESIDENT, AGAIN,

23:32.066 --> 23:34.100
LOOK, EVERY U.S. LEADER HAS

23:34.166 --> 23:35.367
CHOSEN TO MAKE COMPROMISES WHEN

23:35.433 --> 23:36.100
IT COMES TO SAUDI ARABIA.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.400
BUT TRUMP MAY WELL BE THE FIRST

23:37.467 --> 23:37.967
ONE WHO DOESN'T SEE IT AS A

23:38.033 --> 23:38.600
COMPROMISE, BECAUSE HE AND MBS

23:38.667 --> 23:39.400
ARE SIMILAR IN SOME OF THE WORST

23:39.467 --> 23:40.200
POSSIBLE WAYS.

23:40.266 --> 23:41.734
THEY BOTH LOVE MONEY.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.533
THEY'RE BOTH A PRODUCT OF

23:42.600 --> 23:45.734
INHERITED WEALTH.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.967
THEY BOTH LOVE SELF-PROMOTION

23:47.066 --> 23:47.934
YET DISDAIN THE PRESS.

23:47.967 --> 23:50.967
AND THEY EVEN BOTH SHARE A

23:51.066 --> 23:51.934
DESIGN AESTHETIC THAT AMOUNTS TO

23:51.967 --> 23:53.100
"ELVIS TRIES TO REMEMBER WHAT

23:53.166 --> 23:54.166
VERSAILLES LOOKS LIKE BUT

23:54.233 --> 23:55.333
CAN'T."

23:55.400 --> 23:56.633
AND TRUMP'S INTENSE BROMANCE

23:56.700 --> 23:57.934
WITH MBS IS BAD NEWS, BECAUSE

23:58.000 --> 23:59.367
WHEN YOU SET NO BOUNDARIES ON AN

23:59.433 --> 24:00.600
OPPRESSIVE REGIME, THEY ARE

24:00.667 --> 24:02.033
ALWAYS GOING TO ASK THEMSELVES,

24:02.100 --> 24:03.533
"HOW MUCH CAN WE GET AWAY WITH

24:03.600 --> 24:05.300
HERE?"

24:05.367 --> 24:06.867
AND AS WE SAW THIS WEEK, THE

24:06.934 --> 24:08.333
ANSWER TO THAT MAY WELL BE

24:08.400 --> 24:10.767
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.

24:10.834 --> 24:13.000
AND NOW THIS.

27:57.100 --> 27:58.100
FROM THE PIG.

27:58.166 --> 27:59.633
AND, LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THE

27:59.700 --> 28:01.000
MISTAKE.

28:01.066 --> 28:02.066
YOU GO TO PICK UP YOUR PIG, AND

28:02.133 --> 28:03.300
TO YOUR SURPRISE AND

28:03.367 --> 28:04.834
EMBARRASSMENT, THE PIG REACTS TO

28:04.900 --> 28:06.033
YOUR EMBRACE BY SCREAMING LIKE A

28:06.100 --> 28:07.734
BANSHEE WITH A STUBBED TOE.

28:07.800 --> 28:14.467
THE KEY IS, YOU LEARN YOUR

28:14.533 --> 28:16.333
LESSON FROM IT, AND YOU NEVER,

28:16.400 --> 28:17.233
EVER DO IT AGAIN.

28:17.300 --> 28:17.900
>> I'M GONNA MAKE A GIF.

28:26.266 --> 28:27.633
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

28:27.700 --> 28:30.967
MIKA?

28:31.066 --> 28:33.433
FOR A START, THAT'S NOT HOW GIFS

28:33.500 --> 28:35.433
WORK.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.433
A, THEY'RE SILENT, AND B, THEY

28:36.500 --> 28:37.100
TEND NOT TO BE HEAVY ON THE PIG

28:37.166 --> 28:39.700
TORTURE.

28:39.767 --> 28:40.967
THEN THERE'S THE HOST OF ABC'S

28:41.033 --> 28:42.333
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT,"

28:42.400 --> 28:43.266
DAVID MUIR, WHOSE INSTAGRAM IS

28:43.333 --> 28:44.500
LITTERED WITH HIM BASICALLY

28:44.567 --> 28:51.633
DOING HIS BEST "BLUE STEEL"

28:51.700 --> 28:53.734
LOOK, HERE HE IS, STARING DOWN A

28:53.800 --> 28:54.667
HURRICANE.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.433
HERE HE IS, POSING ON A PLANE,

28:56.500 --> 28:57.066
HERE HE IS, FLEXING ON A PLANE,

28:57.133 --> 29:05.100
AND HERE HE IS, WAITING OUTSIDE

29:05.166 --> 29:06.633
A RESTAURANT, LOOKING LIKE ROSS

29:06.700 --> 29:07.400
FROM "FRIENDS," IF, INSTEAD OF

29:07.467 --> 29:08.066
FALLING IN LOVE WITH RACHEL, HE

29:08.133 --> 29:09.233
FELL IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF.

29:09.300 --> 29:09.800
BUT THE GREATEST CABLE NEWS

29:09.867 --> 29:10.433
INSTAGRAMMER -- AND I DO NOT

29:10.500 --> 29:11.133
MEAN THAT AS A COMPLIMENT -- HAS

29:11.200 --> 29:12.600
TO BE CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO, WHO IS

29:12.667 --> 29:13.200
CONSTANTLY POSTING VIDEOS WITH

29:13.266 --> 29:13.834
FUN PEEKS BEHIND THE SCENES OF

29:13.900 --> 29:14.867
HIS SHOW.

29:14.934 --> 29:16.333
>> LIKE WITH THIS MAKEUP, VERY

29:16.400 --> 29:17.867
OFTEN THE TRUTH CAN BE CONCEALED

29:17.934 --> 29:20.533
AND COVERED UP.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.400
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

29:21.467 --> 29:22.400
SPIN ABOUT THESE RUSSIA

29:22.467 --> 29:23.233
DEVELOPMENTS.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.934
WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON WHAT REALLY

29:25.000 --> 29:27.266
MATTERS: U-N-I-T-Y.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.467
UNITY.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.200
I WROTE IT THIS WAY BECAUSE I

29:30.266 --> 29:30.800
WANTED IT TO BE A LITTLE HARD

29:30.867 --> 29:33.667
FOR YOU TO CATCH IT.

29:33.734 --> 29:35.133
EE-YEAH!

29:35.200 --> 29:36.667
AIYAH!

29:36.734 --> 29:37.734
EE-YEAH!

29:37.800 --> 29:39.033
AIYAH!

29:39.100 --> 29:41.367
NEWS TIME!

29:55.100 --> 29:57.667
>> John: COOL.

29:57.734 --> 29:59.333
NOW, I GUESS WE SHOULD ALL JUST

29:59.400 --> 30:01.500
STAY TUNED WHILE CHRIS CUOMO

30:01.567 --> 30:04.700
FIGHTS THE NEWS.

30:04.767 --> 30:05.967
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MAY BE

30:06.033 --> 30:07.266
WONDERING, WHO IS HOLDING THE

30:07.333 --> 30:07.734
CAMERA THERE?

30:07.800 --> 30:09.333
WELL, IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE HIS

30:09.400 --> 30:10.633
OTHER WORKPLACE VIDEOS, THE

30:10.700 --> 30:11.767
ANSWER IS HIS POOR, POOR

30:11.834 --> 30:13.600
PRODUCER, ROSE.

30:13.667 --> 30:14.967
>> WE'RE GETTING READY TO START

30:15.066 --> 30:16.500
THE SHOW, ROSE.

30:16.567 --> 30:17.667
ROSE, HERE'S WHAT WE SHOULD TALK

30:17.734 --> 30:20.233
ABOUT TODAY

30:20.300 --> 30:21.200
ROSE, YOU FORGOT TO TELL PEOPLE

30:21.266 --> 30:22.266
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ON TV

30:22.333 --> 30:23.333
TONIGHT.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.767
ROSE, THEY SEARCHED THE OFFICES

30:24.834 --> 30:26.900
OF THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER.

30:26.967 --> 30:28.700
THIS IS A STORM, ROSE.

30:28.767 --> 30:29.567
SEE THE LIGHTNING?

30:29.633 --> 30:30.800
IT'S A FACTORY, ROSE.

30:30.867 --> 30:32.300
THAT'S AN EASTER EGG, ROSE.

30:32.367 --> 30:35.333
LOOK AT ALL THE SNOW, ROSE.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.467
ROSE, LOOK!

30:36.533 --> 30:37.367
THE SNOW HAS STOPPED.

30:37.433 --> 30:38.500
AND THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG

30:38.567 --> 30:39.467
FOR THE RIDE -- NOT YOU, ROSE.

30:39.533 --> 30:44.133
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

30:53.533 --> 30:54.333
>> John: CONGRATULATIONS,

30:54.400 --> 30:55.734
EVERYONE, I THINK WE ALL

30:55.800 --> 30:56.467
JUST GOT TO FIRST BASE OF

30:56.533 --> 30:57.567
SEXUAL HARASSMENT WITH

30:57.633 --> 30:57.900
CHRIS CUOMO.

30:57.967 --> 30:58.567
BUT THE ODDEST FEATURE OF

30:58.633 --> 30:59.300
CHRIS CUOMO'S INSTAGRAM IS JUST

30:59.367 --> 31:00.033
VIDEOS OF HIM WORKING OUT.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.266
THERE ARE MANY, MANY VIDEOS OF

31:01.333 --> 31:02.066
HIM LIFTING, SWEATING, AND

31:02.133 --> 31:03.700
GRUNTING.

31:03.767 --> 31:05.300
AND LOOK, FAR BE IT FROM ME TO

31:05.367 --> 31:06.233
JUDGE CHRIS CUOMO.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.500
HIS TRICEPS ARE WIDER THAN MY

31:08.567 --> 31:10.233
ENTIRE BODY.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.233
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS

31:12.300 --> 31:14.166
THIRST-PIT OF AN INSTAGRAM FEELS

31:14.233 --> 31:15.066
A LITTLE DESPERATE FOR APPROVAL,

31:15.133 --> 31:16.800
NO MORE SO THAN WITH HIS

31:16.867 --> 31:17.433
CONSTANT EFFORTS TO GET HIS

31:17.500 --> 31:19.533
CATCHPHRASE TO HAPPEN:

31:19.600 --> 31:20.233
>> JUST GETTING IN MY PRESHOW

31:20.300 --> 31:21.133
PUMP.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.500
>> WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

31:22.567 --> 31:23.767
>> CUOMO PRIMETIME.

31:23.834 --> 31:25.967
#LetsGetAfterIt.

31:26.033 --> 31:27.266
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

31:27.333 --> 31:28.567
LET'S GET AFTER IT!

31:28.633 --> 31:29.400
LETS GET AFTER IT!

31:29.467 --> 31:31.600
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

31:31.667 --> 31:32.400
LET'S GET AFTER IT.

31:36.467 --> 31:38.133
>> John: HERE'S AN IDEA.

31:38.233 --> 31:39.400
INSTEAD OF DOING THAT, LET'S GET

31:39.467 --> 31:40.500
AFTER THAT CATCHPHRASE.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.066
I'M SERIOUS.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.700
LET'S HUNT IT DOWN, CATCH IT,

31:43.767 --> 31:45.500
AND KILL IT FOREVER.

31:45.567 --> 31:51.900
BUT YOU KNOW, FOR ALL MY

31:51.967 --> 31:52.734
CRITICISM, THIS HAS ACTUALLY

31:52.800 --> 31:58.500
INSPIRED ME.

31:58.567 --> 31:59.734
'CAUSE I'M KIND OF ON TV.

31:59.800 --> 32:00.300
I SHOULD BE USING INSTAGRAM.

32:00.367 --> 32:00.767
BUT INSTEAD OF A

32:00.834 --> 32:01.400
CHRIS-CUOMO-STYLE ACCOUNT, WHICH

32:01.467 --> 32:02.033
JUST MAKES YOU FEEL SHITTY ABOUT

32:02.100 --> 32:02.633
YOUR PHYSICAL FITNESS AND YOUR

32:02.700 --> 32:03.300
LACK OF A SIDEKICK NAMED ROSE,

32:03.367 --> 32:04.200
I'M GOING TO CAPTURE THE HEARTS

32:04.266 --> 32:05.033
AND MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT

32:05.100 --> 32:06.066
WANT TO GET AFTER IT IN ANY

32:06.133 --> 32:06.700
SHAPE OR FORM BECAUSE THEY'RE

32:06.767 --> 32:08.200
TIRED.

32:08.266 --> 32:09.200
THIS IS WHY I'M KICKING OFF THE

32:09.266 --> 32:10.433
"LAST WEEK TONIGHT"

32:10.500 --> 32:11.066
LET'S NOT GET AFTER IT

32:11.133 --> 32:12.400
CHALLENGE.

32:12.467 --> 32:14.066
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

32:14.133 --> 32:15.033
YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR BODY

32:15.100 --> 32:16.233
FUNCTIONING TOTALLY

32:16.300 --> 32:17.834
AGE-APPROPRIATELY AND YOU POST

32:17.900 --> 32:18.633
IT ON INSTAGRAM USING THE

32:18.700 --> 32:20.333
HASHTAG #LetsNotGetAfterIt.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.533
I ALREADY PUT A FEW ON OUR

32:21.600 --> 32:22.500
SHOW'S INSTAGRAM PAGE TO GET THE

32:22.567 --> 32:23.834
BALL ROLLING.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.233
HERE'S A VIDEO OF ME SLIGHTLY

32:25.300 --> 32:26.567
WINDED AFTER CLIMBING A MEDIUM

32:26.633 --> 32:30.867
NUMBER OF STAIRS.

32:30.934 --> 32:31.934
AND LOOK,

32:32.000 --> 32:33.300
#LetsNotGetAfterIt,

32:33.367 --> 32:34.266
#BreatheMode,

32:34.333 --> 32:37.433
#IShouldntHaveHustledSoMuch.

32:37.500 --> 32:37.967
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE OF ME

32:38.033 --> 32:39.100
STRUGGLING TO OPEN A JAR BEFORE

32:39.166 --> 32:40.467
HANDING IT TO SOMEONE STRONGER

32:40.533 --> 32:41.834
TO OPEN, WHO THEN OPENS IT

32:41.900 --> 32:44.567
EASILY.

32:44.633 --> 32:45.600
AND I'M GIVING THAT THE HASHTAG

32:45.667 --> 32:46.867
#LetsNotGetAfterIt,

32:46.934 --> 32:47.967
#ALittleHelpFromMyFriends,

32:48.033 --> 32:50.533
#OkayButILoosenedItThough.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.400
AND HERE'S ONE FINAL VIDEO I

32:51.467 --> 32:55.066
POSTED.

32:55.133 --> 32:56.200
THAT'S ME NOT LIFTING A PIG

32:56.266 --> 32:58.867
BECAUSE THE PIG DOESN'T LIKE IT.

32:58.934 --> 33:01.667
#LetsNotGetAfterIt,

33:01.734 --> 33:04.867
#ThatsHowYouDontLiftAPig.

33:04.934 --> 33:05.633
AND NOW I AM CHALLENGING YOU,

33:05.700 --> 33:06.734
THE VIEWERS, TO TAKE TO

33:06.800 --> 33:08.467
INSTAGRAM AND GET AFTER IT ONLY

33:08.533 --> 33:09.567
AS MUCH AS IS COMFORTABLE AND

33:09.633 --> 33:10.867
APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.

33:10.934 --> 33:12.033
THAT IS OUR SHOW.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

33:13.066 --> 33:14.166
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

33:14.233 --> 33:21.700
GOOD NIGHT!

33:21.767 --> 33:23.900
>> I'M NOT GOING TO PICK YOU UP.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.333
I SENSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

33:25.400 --> 33:25.934
PICKED UP.

33:25.967 --> 33:27.900
SO I SHALL NOT PICK YOU UP.

33:27.967 --> 33:30.066
WE CAN JUST SIT HERE, MAN AND

33:30.133 --> 33:30.800
PIG.

33:30.867 --> 33:32.967
IF YOU WANT TO GO OVER THERE?

33:33.033 --> 33:34.734
YOU CAN GO OVER THERE.

33:34.800 --> 33:35.734
I CERTAINLY WON'T PICK YOU UP

33:35.800 --> 33:37.033
AND BRING YOU OVER THERE BECAUSE

33:37.100 --> 33:39.533
I SENSE YOU WANT TO BE SOMEWHERE

33:39.600 --> 33:41.300
DIFFERENT FROM WHERE I AM.

33:41.367 --> 33:44.900
I OFTEN FEEL THAT WAY.

33:44.967 --> 33:45.266
SEE?

33:45.333 --> 33:47.700
HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO.

33:47.767 --> 33:48.533
AT THAT.

33:48.600 --> 33:49.600
RIGHT?
