00:20.943 --> 00:23.337
<i>Previously
on "Green Lantern"...</i>

00:23.362 --> 00:25.984
It's... Pleasant to see you all.

00:26.009 --> 00:29.475
- Even you.
- What have you done with the angry guy?

00:29.500 --> 00:32.915
I thought this would be a good place
to become someone else.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.696
Someone less... Angry.

00:37.826 --> 00:41.456
Season 1, Episode 18:
<b>"Prisoner of Sinestro"</b>

00:41.479 --> 00:45.750
Moving on. Green Lantern
combat protocol review question 33...

00:45.777 --> 00:49.566
Seriously? This is the longest
pop quiz in history.

00:49.585 --> 00:51.393
All right,
according to the manual,

00:51.394 --> 00:54.693
what's the count on operational
command fail safes?

00:55.801 --> 00:59.582
- Uh, 11?
- 12. Very close.

00:59.583 --> 01:03.518
Unfortunately, "close" only counts
in <i>Altaverox ring toss</i>.

01:03.588 --> 01:06.860
Don't we have an app that
does this boring stuff for us?

01:06.886 --> 01:10.777
Going up against the Anti-Monitor,
Jordan, we do things by the book!

01:14.228 --> 01:17.039
Razer, I am glad that
you have returned to the ship.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.876
That is, I am pleased that you
completed your task on Odym.

01:20.907 --> 01:26.349
On the contrary. The Blue Lanterns were
unable to help me purge rage from my heart.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.442
It changed nothing.

01:28.908 --> 01:35.732
Perhaps that is for the best. I...
All of us prefer you to remain unchanged.

01:35.788 --> 01:39.255
Perhaps I can help you
in your scans for the Anti-Monitor.

01:39.323 --> 01:43.608
No. I will work
more efficiently alone.

01:45.202 --> 01:47.490
[beeping]

01:47.521 --> 01:51.050
I have a communication
from Green Lantern 1417.

01:51.074 --> 01:55.589
1417? OK! Finally,
a call I want to take.

01:55.622 --> 02:01.660
- Sinestro? Oh, great.
- Sinestro... Is he some great warrior?

02:01.681 --> 02:05.722
He's a legend in the Core; one of the
most decorated Green Lanterns ever.

02:05.739 --> 02:09.008
In the Battle of Kund,
he took out 10 platoons solo.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.925
After messing up the battle plan.
He's an undisciplined hothead

02:12.957 --> 02:15.593
who bends the rules to whatever
he needs them to be that day.

02:15.629 --> 02:19.914
Like I said, awesome. And taught me
loads of useful tricks.

02:19.933 --> 02:22.300
That's part of your problem.

02:22.321 --> 02:25.964
Aya, put Mr. Thal Sinestro
on the big screen.

02:26.239 --> 02:29.099
<i>Jordan...
Fancy running into you here.</i>

02:29.145 --> 02:31.414
Hello, Sinestro.
How can we help?

02:31.465 --> 02:36.296
<i>I have taken custody of a fugitive from
these repulsive Spider Guild beings.</i>

02:36.355 --> 02:41.196
Yeah, we've met. Let me guess: The Guild
objected to you taking their prisoner.

02:41.225 --> 02:44.481
<i>Evidently. At any rate,
I wouldn't be entirely opposed</i>

02:44.492 --> 02:48.363
<i>to having you chauffeur me to Oa
on that luxury liner of yours.</i>

02:48.395 --> 02:51.598
Not that we're not honored,
but what's the catch?

02:53.039 --> 02:56.811
<i>I am temporarily trapped
aboard their frigate.</i>

02:56.843 --> 03:01.313
<i>Meet me by the starboard tower.
Get in close, and don't dawdle, Jordan.</i>

03:01.396 --> 03:02.958
I'm on it.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.723
Incoming message
from the Spider Guild frigate.

03:13.779 --> 03:19.649
<i>Green Lanterns, your fellow Core member
has illegally seized one of our captains.</i>

03:19.690 --> 03:24.032
<i>Do not assist him, or we will
interpret your actions as hostile.</i>

03:24.033 --> 03:26.298
Or, how about you give us
our Core member back,

03:26.299 --> 03:29.084
or we'll interpret your actions
as not so nice?

03:29.096 --> 03:32.699
<i>You're making a grave mistake.</i>

03:33.812 --> 03:37.546
Attention passengers, please remain seated
while the fasten seatbelt sign is on.

03:54.405 --> 03:56.779
Shields down to 40%.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.676
Sinestro, I hate to rush you...

04:12.144 --> 04:15.272
<i>Don't get hysterical, Jordan,
I'm almost there.</i>

04:52.629 --> 04:56.607
<i>You think you've done something
heroic freeing Neuraxis?</i>

04:56.726 --> 04:59.092
<i>You don't know
what he's capable...</i>

05:00.098 --> 05:02.571
<i>There is a task
I must attend to.</i>

05:03.122 --> 05:04.676
What was that about?!

05:04.770 --> 05:09.077
Warning. The Spider Guild ship has
activated its self-destruct sequence.

05:09.121 --> 05:11.632
Its engines are about
to go critical.

05:46.435 --> 05:48.245
[exhales]

05:50.420 --> 05:55.063
- Green Lantern Sinestro, safely aboard.
- Oh, joy.

05:57.126 --> 05:59.782
That thing went up
like a Varzan firework.

06:00.609 --> 06:02.742
Why the heck did they go
and punch their own ticket?

06:02.784 --> 06:04.911
Here's the Lantern
who can answer that.

06:05.261 --> 06:09.390
- Sinestro, what happened out there?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

06:09.422 --> 06:11.475
Who can fathom
the arachnid mind?

06:11.503 --> 06:13.791
I'm more concerned with
getting this living criminal

06:13.792 --> 06:16.552
Neuraxis safely
into a science cell.

06:21.167 --> 06:25.214
I managed to liberate some Spider Guild
tech from our friends before I left.

06:25.261 --> 06:28.591
I'd hardly call
their primitive devices "tech".

06:29.268 --> 06:32.886
Sinestro, this is a Razer.
A Red Lantern who's on our side now.

06:32.897 --> 06:37.656
You keep a Red Lantern mascot on the
Guardian's most advanced prototype ship?

06:37.657 --> 06:39.224
Have I taught you nothing?

06:39.225 --> 06:42.198
He's done some very good work.
I can vouch for him.

06:42.537 --> 06:45.274
And that's Aya, our ship's A.I.

06:45.318 --> 06:49.244
Welcome aboard, Green Lantern Sinestro.
You require any refreshment?

06:49.918 --> 06:52.972
Leave it to you both to turn
the fastest weapon in the Universe

06:52.973 --> 06:55.048
into some sort of day spa.

06:55.085 --> 06:59.169
This ain't no day spa.
No one's getting soft here.

07:02.953 --> 07:07.963
Let's get down to business.
What's the deal with Neuraxis here?

07:08.031 --> 07:12.403
The truth is, I'm not sure.
But he's a wanted criminal

07:12.439 --> 07:15.842
and I'm an obedient Green Lantern,
so I'm taking him to Oa.

07:15.886 --> 07:19.263
"Obedient Green Lantern".
[chuckles] Good one.

07:20.121 --> 07:22.100
Looks like it's asleep.

07:22.155 --> 07:25.280
Guess little guy's tuckered out
from all the excitement.

07:25.348 --> 07:28.889
So, Sinestro, I was just
telling everybody about the time

07:28.890 --> 07:31.849
that you stole my thunder
at the Battle of Kund.

07:31.850 --> 07:33.330
You remember that time in Or...

07:33.331 --> 07:38.662
Yes, great battle. What memories.
Excuse me. I must rest.

07:40.385 --> 07:43.750
Guess taking over a Spider Guild
frigate can take it out of anyone.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.014
Heh.

07:47.962 --> 07:51.873
Neuraxis is on the most wanted list,
but there's almost no info.

07:52.029 --> 07:53.480
What gives?

07:53.495 --> 07:56.205
Maybe it escaped from the buffet
at the last Guardian formal dinner

07:56.206 --> 07:57.579
and they want payback.

07:58.325 --> 08:00.114
Aya, what's going on?

08:00.153 --> 08:04.353
Someone or something has
tampered with the power couplings.

08:05.479 --> 08:07.108
Aah!

08:15.760 --> 08:18.624
Sinestro, what's wrong?
Talk to me, buddy!

08:26.132 --> 08:29.301
Green Lantern Sinestro
is damaging vital systems.

08:31.383 --> 08:35.056
- Sinestro, you're one of us.
- That's what you think.

08:36.610 --> 08:38.998
[both groaning]

08:46.229 --> 08:49.155
This is one of your greatest
Green Lanterns?

08:49.223 --> 08:51.320
Anyone can have a bad day.

08:53.656 --> 08:56.010
He's out. Now what?

08:56.131 --> 08:59.626
Lock him in the science cell.
But get that ring off him first.

08:59.647 --> 09:02.152
This is Thal Sinestro
we're dealing with.

09:05.285 --> 09:07.249
[groaning]

09:11.284 --> 09:14.647
What's happening?
What have you done?

09:14.684 --> 09:18.055
- What... what's going on?
- Sorry, Thal.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.388
Until we figured out
what caused your freak out,

09:20.406 --> 09:22.337
you'll stay in there
with the fish.

09:22.376 --> 09:25.259
You realize you tried
to kill us?

09:25.363 --> 09:29.697
What? I did no such thing!
You've all gone mad.

09:29.750 --> 09:33.368
You might have caught a bug
on the Spider Guild ship. Literally.

09:33.509 --> 09:37.522
- You look like death warmed over.
- I don't feel ill at all.

09:37.576 --> 09:41.034
And I... I don't
remember anything.

09:41.066 --> 09:44.368
Well, don't worry. We'll take you
to Oa and get you all fixed up.

09:50.419 --> 09:52.773
Maybe he's got the Valvian flu
or something.

09:52.796 --> 09:55.548
I heard it can cause
mild hallucinations, you know?

09:55.600 --> 09:59.761
- He tried to kill us.
- So it's a bad case.

09:59.828 --> 10:02.795
Aya, take that weapon
and the rest of the Spider Guild tech

10:02.796 --> 10:04.698
and stash it in one
of the storage spaces.

10:04.699 --> 10:07.034
And lock it down.

10:24.876 --> 10:26.722
Hello, Aya.

10:26.937 --> 10:30.427
I did not expect that behavior
from Green Lantern Sinestro.

10:30.467 --> 10:33.474
I'm sure he'll get over it
real soon.

10:33.559 --> 10:37.466
But you...
I'd rather talk about you.

10:37.533 --> 10:43.006
- You would? Why?
- You're vital to running this ship.

10:43.039 --> 10:46.353
Plus, you look really
great today.

10:46.525 --> 10:50.057
I... I assembled myself
the same way I always do.

10:50.114 --> 10:54.028
Although I am experimenting with
a new teflonian exterior glaze.

10:54.134 --> 10:58.147
That's it. I'm really liking
the way you're put together.

11:02.791 --> 11:05.860
Why are you examining
my helmet? Is something wrong?

11:05.902 --> 11:10.632
Nothing's wrong. I thought you'd like
some extra special attention from me.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.700
I... I...

11:13.674 --> 11:17.938
Hal told me to get that Spider
Guild weapon for him to examine.

11:18.659 --> 11:20.980
I'll see you around, Aya.

11:22.039 --> 11:25.907
Analyzing interaction.
Analyzing...

11:26.249 --> 11:28.732
The co-pilot commander
control boards are shot.

11:28.770 --> 11:30.526
They may be good
for spare parts.

11:30.576 --> 11:34.019
That can wait. We only need
one pilot with me here, right?

11:34.769 --> 11:36.370
Right...

11:37.242 --> 11:40.863
Let's reroute power to the sensor array
couplings and we should be good to go.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.193
Green Lanterns, I just had the
strangest encounter with Razer.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.136
- Strange in what way?
- He was very... Friendly.

11:48.408 --> 11:52.963
Oh. Um, that's nothing
to be worried or ashamed of.

11:53.017 --> 11:58.146
You see, Aya, some carbon-based lifeforms
have these things called hormones.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.970
Did you receive the weapon
Razer said you requested?

12:01.020 --> 12:05.956
- I didn't ask for any weapon.
- Some weird stuff going on around here.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.723
You keep on the repairs.

12:23.397 --> 12:25.042
[grunting]

12:25.110 --> 12:27.480
Razer, what are you doing?

12:27.740 --> 12:29.426
[grunts]

12:40.634 --> 12:42.900
Kilowog, get down here.

13:12.320 --> 13:17.260
Jordan? Where are you? This better
not be some kind of Earth joke.

13:17.327 --> 13:18.817
It is.

13:19.097 --> 13:22.714
The joke is,
I'm going to kill you.

13:23.830 --> 13:25.278
Get it?

13:33.711 --> 13:38.314
Do not raise an alarm if you value
our existence. I must speak to you.

13:40.581 --> 13:43.251
No one on this vessel
is behaving predictably.

13:43.311 --> 13:45.765
So someone else
finally noticed.

13:52.178 --> 13:56.742
It's that alien, Neuraxis.
He's what's called "a mind jumper".

13:57.217 --> 14:00.388
It's a being that can take over
another's body at will.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.222
[grunting and groaning]

14:07.709 --> 14:10.644
Easy, Hal. Maybe what
Sinestro got is airborne.

14:10.712 --> 14:13.079
Let's have Aya scan you
with the med comm.

14:13.147 --> 14:18.262
Nothing's wrong. The entire crew
has to go. And we'll start with you.

14:24.963 --> 14:28.468
[grunting]

14:30.575 --> 14:34.264
[groaning]

14:37.270 --> 14:39.071
What are you doing?!

14:43.410 --> 14:45.036
What is wrong
with the two of you?!

14:45.083 --> 14:48.128
It's space madness.
We're losing our minds!

14:48.129 --> 14:52.366
No. One of us
is an alien assassin.

15:00.886 --> 15:03.370
The only thing that explains
what's going on around here

15:03.371 --> 15:06.536
is that Neuraxis is getting
inside our heads... literally.

15:06.575 --> 15:08.890
The trouble started when
Sinestro brought him aboard.

15:08.901 --> 15:10.780
You're not making
any sense, Hal.

15:10.811 --> 15:12.891
Actually, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

15:12.917 --> 15:15.624
That brain fish must be able
to jump from body to body,

15:15.625 --> 15:17.743
<i>somehow taking over the host.</i>

15:19.307 --> 15:22.841
So... Which one of us
is it controlling now?

15:23.302 --> 15:24.733
Not me!

15:24.883 --> 15:28.132
You would hardly volunteer the
information If you were possessed.

15:28.133 --> 15:31.375
Hang on. Neuraxis never
attacked us with constructs.

15:31.402 --> 15:34.156
When we became Lanterns,
the Ring chose us.

15:34.157 --> 15:37.467
But when we're under that goldfish's
influence, we're not ourselves.

15:37.468 --> 15:41.186
So the Ring doesn't function.
That explains the weapons.

15:41.592 --> 15:46.111
And it means if you can make a construct,
the alien isn't controlling you.

15:47.826 --> 15:51.234
See?
I'm... I'm good.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.470
There.

15:55.276 --> 15:59.642
- Well, this is silly!
- Make a construct. Prove that you can.

16:00.312 --> 16:02.803
A... a construct?

16:03.230 --> 16:07.290
See, he won't make a construct.
He's the alien, Razer! Kill him!

16:07.358 --> 16:09.918
- Settle down.
- [grunts]

16:09.959 --> 16:13.948
- Now let's see you make a construct.
- I already did.

16:13.974 --> 16:17.017
- He's the alien!
- Back off.

16:18.608 --> 16:22.761
This is pointless. The alien can just
jump into each of us in sequence.

16:25.003 --> 16:27.310
We have to make constructs
at the same time.

16:27.329 --> 16:29.017
<i>I have a better idea.</i>

16:30.410 --> 16:33.718
- How'd he get out?
- Never mind that.

16:33.762 --> 16:38.276
The sound you're hearing is this room
and the entire ship de-pressurizing.

16:38.328 --> 16:41.964
I've only just pieced it all together.
I was briefed by the Guardians

16:41.965 --> 16:45.642
that Neuraxis was one of the most
wanted assassins in the Universe,

16:45.685 --> 16:49.192
but even they completely
underestimated what he was capable of.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.855
So did I.

16:50.893 --> 16:53.763
<i>It was Neuraxis that took over
the Spider Guild captain</i>

16:53.764 --> 16:56.243
<i>and caused him to destroy
his own ship.</i>

16:59.299 --> 17:03.953
<i>Shortly after I came aboard the
Interceptor, it took over my mind as well.</i>

17:06.412 --> 17:10.266
The victim doesn't remember what
happens when under Neuraxis' power.

17:10.267 --> 17:13.693
It'll do the same to everyone,
picking us off one by one.

17:13.694 --> 17:19.150
But do not fear. I have an absolute test
to see who the alien is inhabiting.

17:19.178 --> 17:21.612
<i>We purge the ship of oxygen.</i>

17:21.613 --> 17:23.855
<i>The real Lanterns among us
will be protected</i>

17:23.856 --> 17:26.314
<i>by our Power Rings'
life support fields.</i>

17:26.365 --> 17:28.214
<i>Neuraxis will not.</i>

17:28.250 --> 17:32.110
The criminal can't jump into Aya, so
that means the only choice it will have

17:32.111 --> 17:35.159
is to go back to its own body
in the science cell...

17:35.160 --> 17:38.242
The one room on the ship
that will remain pressurized.

17:38.254 --> 17:42.009
How can we be so sure Neuraxis
isn't controlling you right now?

17:58.266 --> 18:03.463
[gasping and choking]

18:04.611 --> 18:07.875
Green Lantern Sinestro,
we must re-pressurize the vessel.

18:07.904 --> 18:12.343
No. Neuraxis is still
controlling him. We must wait.

18:14.423 --> 18:17.540
What if you're wrong, Sinestro?
What if it won't leave?

18:17.541 --> 18:20.582
Criminals have a keen
sense of preservation, Jordan.

18:22.522 --> 18:24.193
What's it going to be, Neuraxis?

18:24.194 --> 18:28.332
If you want to live, the only pressurized
space on the ship is in the science cell.

18:28.333 --> 18:33.199
I give you my word as a Green Lantern,
you will not be harmed. Now go!

18:36.935 --> 18:40.743
- We must re-pressurize the area now!
- Not yet.

18:41.153 --> 18:46.299
[gasping and groaning continues]

18:53.119 --> 18:56.320
[coughing]

19:04.263 --> 19:07.099
[groaning]

19:14.596 --> 19:17.076
Something the matter?

19:17.212 --> 19:18.780
Oh, wait...

19:19.735 --> 19:24.451
It seems I forgot I'd compromised
this chamber's seal when I broke out.

19:24.518 --> 19:27.855
There's no atmosphere
in here, either.

19:27.922 --> 19:33.002
It's difficult to mind jump when
you're in a state of shock, isn't it?

19:33.929 --> 19:36.434
Razer, what is your status?

19:36.460 --> 19:41.041
[groaning] I'll live.
But I feel how Kilowog looks.

19:41.084 --> 19:45.708
- Always with the smart mouth.
- Where did Sinestro go?

19:48.885 --> 19:51.330
Justice is served.

19:57.502 --> 19:59.362
What happened?

19:59.389 --> 20:02.291
I must have damaged
the venting system when I escaped.

20:02.359 --> 20:06.162
Criminal's body suffocated
before his mind returned.

20:06.652 --> 20:09.900
Thal...
The Green Lantern code.

20:10.366 --> 20:15.109
I didn't kill him, Jordan.
I simply didn't save him... In time.

20:15.671 --> 20:19.370
A tragic accident.
Perhaps it's for the best.

20:19.376 --> 20:23.913
You wouldn't want to take a chance on
Neuraxis getting loose on Oa, would you?

20:24.379 --> 20:25.991
He has a point.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.588
Let's get this ship moving
and report back to Oa.

20:42.698 --> 20:45.833
All your systems
appear to be back online.

20:46.524 --> 20:50.940
Did I do anything strange
while under the influence of Neuraxis?

20:51.007 --> 20:54.043
Other than trying to kill
your fellow Green Lanterns?

20:54.079 --> 20:57.615
Yes. Did I... Harm you?

20:59.503 --> 21:01.829
I should have known
you were not yourself.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.136
Why?

21:03.362 --> 21:07.766
You expressed interest
in spending time with me.

21:16.242 --> 21:19.242
