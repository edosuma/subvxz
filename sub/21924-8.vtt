MAN: Przewalski horses.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.173
Ancient Mongolian stock.

00:08.299 --> 00:09.634
The whole point of
breeding these horses

00:09.759 --> 00:11.636
is to airlift a stud
back to Mongolia.

00:11.761 --> 00:13.847
Attila's the first
one to be shipped out.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.306
 Hey, Attila.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.185
Smells like your
family, doesn't it?

00:19.310 --> 00:21.855
And I know you don't
want to leave them.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.940
TY: Come here.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.692
Nice work.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.486
 I came to tell you that I
think that Adam is a cool guy.

00:28.611 --> 00:30.739
But I wish I hadn't invited
him on a road trip with us.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.031
 Why?

00:32.156 --> 00:33.992
 Because I thought
that it wasn't

00:34.117 --> 00:35.076
the right time to do this.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.750
 Tim's been talking
about team roping.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.920
And I thought maybe
we could be partners.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.839
 Maybe.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.884
 Cool.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.294
 That was awful!

01:26.419 --> 01:27.462
The hell are you doing?

01:27.587 --> 01:28.922
 Well, I got him by the horn--

01:29.047 --> 01:31.007
TIM: Oh, good for you, Jade.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.717
How's she supposed
to get at his feet

01:32.842 --> 01:34.135
when you're yanking
the steer left?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.178
 Well, my horse, he--

01:35.303 --> 01:36.096
 It's not the horse!

01:36.221 --> 01:37.305
Don't blame the horse.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.598
You've been doing this all day.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.392
You're actually getting worse.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.810
[laughter]

01:41.935 --> 01:43.395
Who's laughing?

01:43.520 --> 01:44.729
What are you smiling about?

01:47.482 --> 01:48.775
None of you were
doing any better.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.694
What is your problem today?

01:50.819 --> 01:52.654
Do I have to show you
how to do this myself?

01:55.907 --> 01:58.493
I guess I do.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.661
Jack, come on.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.794
You're flying, Lyndy.
- Look at you.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.253
- [laughs]
- Hey.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.255
 Oh, I'm dizzy!

02:10.380 --> 02:11.798
 See who wants to say hi?

02:11.923 --> 02:12.882
 Yeah!

02:13.008 --> 02:13.675
 Is that Spartan?
[cooing]

02:13.800 --> 02:14.509
 That's Spartan!

02:14.634 --> 02:15.635
Yeah, you can talk to him.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.803
- [laughs]
- You can talk to him.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.013
- He's soft.
- Very nice.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.472
Yeah.

02:19.597 --> 02:20.432
Yeah, oh, you can pet
with your feet too!

[laughter]

02:21.307 --> 02:22.976
Look at that!

02:23.101 --> 02:25.603
 Oh, I hate to say this, but
I have to get back to work.

02:25.729 --> 02:26.980
 OK, OK.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.314
 All right?

02:28.440 --> 02:29.399
You OK to put Lyndy
down for a nap?

02:29.524 --> 02:30.942
 Yeah, sounds good.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.446
[guitar music]

02:36.781 --> 02:37.699
 That's it.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.867
Look for your corner.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.035
Nice.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.412
OK, good.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.205
No circling around.

02:49.919 --> 02:53.048
That's it.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.008
Yeah.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.217
Nice.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.802

02:57.927 --> 02:58.845

02:58.970 --> 03:00.055
 Hi.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.681
 Paula Westfield, Val's friend.

03:01.806 --> 03:02.932
 Right.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.184
Yeah, you're bringing
a horse by next week.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.602
 Actually, it has to be sooner.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.729
Holloway is an
absolute disaster.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.563
 Holloway?

03:08.688 --> 03:10.357
 My daughter's new jumper.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.400
Well, at least that's
what he's supposed to be.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.235
Every time we try to
saddle him, he starts

03:14.361 --> 03:15.653
jumping around like a lunatic.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.739
 It could be ulcers
or even back pain.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.532
 No, my vet already
ruled those out.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.951
We need to nip this
in the bud, like now.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.997
 It's just, I booked the week
off to spend with my husband.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.624
 Oh, well I, uh--

03:27.749 --> 03:29.709
I don't want to impinge
on your family holiday.

03:29.834 --> 03:33.171
But spent a small
fortune on this horse.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.298
He has incredible bloodlines.

03:35.423 --> 03:36.383
If you can't make
time for him, I

03:36.508 --> 03:38.051
guess I'll take him elsewhere.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.096
 Just-- we have a small baby,
so it's not like I'm gonna

03:41.221 --> 03:43.139
be getting far anyway.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.891
I could work with one horse.

03:45.016 --> 03:45.767
 Fantastic.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.103
Thank you.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.106
Dylan.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.734
Yeah, I need you to get
Holloway over to Heartland ASAP.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.778
No, whatever you're doing,
this is more important.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.697
Trust me.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.490
[beep]

04:00.615 --> 04:04.619
On another matter, I'm
having a little barbecue

04:04.744 --> 04:06.079
at my place this weekend.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.748
I do it once a year for
the equestrian community.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.917
Val says you made quite a
splash at the Sandstone Classic

04:11.042 --> 04:11.876
in Okotoks.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.294
You should come by.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.755
Uh-- you too.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.589
 Yeah, uh--

04:17.716 --> 04:18.591
- I mean, if Amy--
- Sure.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.884
- --wants to.
- Great.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.302
I'll add your names
to the guest list.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.686
[guitar music]

04:29.811 --> 04:30.603
 You ready?

04:30.729 --> 04:31.312
 Yeah.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.230
Yeah, I'm ready.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.233
You ready?

04:35.358 --> 04:38.820
[mooing, horses whinnying]

04:52.917 --> 04:54.085
 What was that?

04:54.210 --> 04:55.295
 What?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.588
You didn't set him up properly.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.089
How was I supposed
to get to his feet?

04:58.214 --> 05:00.925
 I put that steer right
where you needed him to be.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.010
You flat out missed.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.932
 OK, that's it for today.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.017
Everybody go home.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.029
 Who do you think
that was on the phone?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.655
Did you hear the way
she was talking to him?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.115
 Probably some
poor stable hand.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.368
[laughter]

05:26.493 --> 05:28.203
 She is something else.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.829
And I can't believe we agreed
to go to her little barbecue.

05:29.954 --> 05:30.705
 Oh, trust me.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.082
There's nothing little about it.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.458
She puts it on every year.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.127
It's this big, lavish,
over-the-top party.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.128
 Hey.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.713
Who you talking about?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.548
 Oh, a friend of Val's
from the English community.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.842
She's a little bit of a diva.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.719
 Well, she is a
friend of Val's.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.306
 Yeah, and adamant that I work
with her horse immediately.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.808
Ty, I'm so sorry.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.393
I know.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.602
 That's OK.
It's all right.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.020
These things come up, you know?
- Yeah.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.522
[baby crying on monitor]
- I'll answer it.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.731
 I'll get her.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.941
I want to spend
some time with her.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.609
 OK.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.027
 And if that horse
comes, just throw

06:01.152 --> 06:02.070
him in one of the back pens.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.071
 Sure.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.454
 Is everything all right?

06:11.579 --> 06:13.707
 Yeah, it's just
my friend Wyatt.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.041
We were supposed
to go for lunch,

06:15.166 --> 06:17.002
and now he says he
only has half an hour.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.420
 Hmm.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.046
You been spending a
lot of time with Wyatt?

06:20.171 --> 06:21.131
 No.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.048
Not lately.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.467
Not since--

06:24.592 --> 06:26.344
 Since what?

06:26.469 --> 06:28.304
It-- it-- it's nothing.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.723
It's just-- boys are dumb.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.283
 Hi.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.327
My name's Dylan.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.539
You got a name to go with
those big brown eyes?

06:54.664 --> 06:55.457
 It's Georgie.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.251
 It's nice to meet you.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.921
So what would you want
me to do with this guy?

07:02.047 --> 07:04.299
 The back pens.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.633
They're this way.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.141
[horse whinnying]
- Look out!

07:13.266 --> 07:14.142
Whoa!

07:17.062 --> 07:19.147
 You OK?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.398
 Yeah.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.400
I'm good.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.152
Crazy, isn't he?

of day, you sink into a dream,

You dreamer.

07:56.935 --> 07:57.852
You dreamer.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.905
JADE: Is that normal for Tim?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.699
I mean, he can be
pretty demanding,

08:10.824 --> 08:13.201
but doesn't usually
lose it on us like that.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.120
I-- but he was right.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.121
I sucked.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.706
 That's not true.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.375
Well, not completely.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.710
 Tell me straight.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.295
 You could use a little work.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.715
OK, a lot of work.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.091
 I don't know what to do.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.552
I-- I can't just ask Tim
for extra one-on-one.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.846
[scoffs] Not the
way he's acting.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.639
 I could give you
a few pointers.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.849
I mean, if you want me to.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.517
 Really?
You wouldn't mind?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.852
 Not at all.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.477
I can meet up this
afternoon or something?

08:40.602 --> 08:42.981
 OK, I guess it couldn't hurt.

08:43.106 --> 08:43.815
 Cool.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.066
All right, see you later.

posted from the Gopher Museum.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.540
 Yeah, it-- it was a great day.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.833
 Yeah, I know right?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.002
The pool hall
diorama was classic.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.796
The hair salon, the bank heist.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.090
 The barbecue was cool too.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.383
 Yeah.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.761
Jack really knows how
to grill a steak, huh?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.889

about the steaks.

09:45.877 --> 09:46.961
 You've been at
this for a while.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.005
 Yeah.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.217
Paula said that he freaks out
as soon as a rider gets on him.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.303
So I thought I would see how
he does on the ground first.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.471
 And?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.807
 Apparently, not much better.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.767
I think I need to
get on and ride him.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.852
 Are you sure he's
ready for that?

10:02.977 --> 10:07.065
 I'll know better when
I get a saddle on him.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.316
 I got it.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.317
 Thanks.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.402
[music playing]

10:10.527 --> 10:11.736
 Oh, I better run.

10:11.861 --> 10:12.779
I gotta get back to
the rodeo grounds.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.114
 Wha-- uh, is that the time?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.073
Wow.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.741
I-- I, uh, should head out also.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.159
So I will see you guys later.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.703
 Well, do you want to
do something tomorrow?

10:19.828 --> 10:21.079
Like, go on a trail
ride or something?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.539
 Yeah, sure.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.665
I'll text Adam and Olivia,
see if they're up for it.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.083
 I mean--

10:25.208 --> 10:27.085
I thought-- I meant
just the two of us.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.586
 Yeah, OK.

10:28.712 --> 10:29.921
That sounds good.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.339
Tomorrow.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.298
Peace.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.473
 [sighs]

10:40.598 --> 10:41.516
 That was extremely awkward.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.559
 Yeah.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.685
 What's going on?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.562
 Wish I knew.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.940
 Well, did something happen?

10:49.065 --> 10:52.193
 OK, it's not a big deal.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.154
But we kissed.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.865
 Like a peck?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.033
OK, well, that's huge.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.409
 I know.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.244
And then why has he been
avoiding me ever since?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.371
And whenever we're
together, he just

11:03.496 --> 11:06.624
acts like we're all buddy-buddy
and it never happened.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.376
 Yeah, that's weird.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.669
I don't know.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.756
I think you just
have to talk to him.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.299
Did that guy just--

11:14.424 --> 11:15.216
was that--

11:23.016 --> 11:24.142
 Hey.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.853
Georgie, right?

11:26.978 --> 11:29.230
Uh, I'm-- I'm Dylan.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.273
 Sorry.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.400
This is-- this is
my friend, Jade.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.319
 It's nice to meet you.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.403
 Decent coffee here?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.404
 Uh-huh.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.702
Hmm.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.747
 Who was that?

11:45.872 --> 11:47.374
 Weren't are we
talking about Wyatt?

11:47.499 --> 11:48.249
 Wyatt who?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.250
[phone chimes]

11:49.376 --> 11:50.251
Oh, OK.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.503
Um, I really have to go.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.838
But we'll talk about
Wyatt and that guy later.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.428
[horse whinnying]

12:00.553 --> 12:01.346
AMY: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.263
TY: Easy.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.264
 Ty, be careful!

12:03.390 --> 12:05.183
TY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:05.308 --> 12:08.103
[horse whinnying]

12:08.228 --> 12:11.106
Easy.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.440
AMY: Whoa.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.483
 Geez.

12:13.608 --> 12:14.609
You sure it's not ulcers?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.027
 Yeah.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.070
Paula said she had
her vet check him out.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.113
 Well, you're not
getting on him.

12:18.238 --> 12:18.905
Not like this.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.949
 You're right.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.368
 You're usually a lot
tougher to convince.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.746
 Well, [sighs] I don't think
I'm gonna try and jump him.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.790
 You mean like now or ever?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.500
 I'm not sure.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.336
But from what I've seen, I
don't think it's a good idea.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.380
 So you really think you
can't work with this horse, eh?

12:35.505 --> 12:38.008
 I didn't say that.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.968
I want to keep working
with him, but I'm

12:40.093 --> 12:41.636
gonna try something different.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.140
[phone beeping]

12:45.265 --> 12:46.016
 Easy.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.058
You're all right.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.059
 Hey, Dad.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.815
 Wait, shouldn't I be
practicing roping the horns?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.066
 No, you have that down.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.651
Problem is you're
turning too quickly.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.111
 Yeah, but it's a timed event.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.946
 Yeah, but if you rush,
your horse will deke left.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.490
Then the steer's out of
position for the heeler.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.576
You try too hard to be fast,
and you'll end up losing time.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.577
So don't think quick.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.204
Think smooth.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.622
 OK.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.499
 So I'll release the steer.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.835
And instead of going left, just
follow him in a straight line,

13:13.960 --> 13:15.462
and I'll rope his feet.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.547
 That's it?

13:17.672 --> 13:19.799
 For now.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.177
You need to practice patience.

13:22.302 --> 13:28.099
 [sighs]

13:28.224 --> 13:29.434
[mooing, horses whinnying]
- Yah, yah!

13:29.559 --> 13:30.477
 Yah, yah!

13:43.907 --> 13:46.534
 We did it!

13:46.659 --> 13:47.452
Like that?

13:47.577 --> 13:48.370
 Exactly.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.329
Let's go again.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.288
 OK.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.498
 That's it.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.751
Good job, Holloway.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.169
OK, moment of truth.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.295
 Yeah.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.171
 Hey, Dad.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.339
 Hey.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.383
 Thanks for coming
and checking him out.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.842
 Yeah.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.095
Well, I was coming
anyway for dinner, so.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.056
And I want to see the baby.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.518
So let's get it over
with, see what he's got.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.435
[horse neighing]

14:12.560 --> 14:13.478
Oh!

14:13.603 --> 14:15.438
That's it!

14:15.563 --> 14:17.399
Good job.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.359
Look at him go!

14:19.484 --> 14:22.904
[horse neighing]

14:24.781 --> 14:29.202
Whoa there.

14:29.327 --> 14:36.710
[laughs] So what do you think?

14:36.835 --> 14:38.670
 Explosive.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.963
Got a real upside.

14:40.088 --> 14:40.922
Nice bronc.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.590
 Yeah, except he's not.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.427
He's a jumper.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.761
 It's not a jumper, Amy.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.929
 I know.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.097
This is what he was born to do.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.765
He absolutely loves it.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.225
But that's the last thing his--
[baby crying on monitor]

14:52.350 --> 14:53.643
--owner wants to hear.

14:53.768 --> 14:54.561
 I-- I'll get her.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.520
 Yeah?

14:55.645 --> 14:56.604
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.274
You, uh, you go be
with your jumper.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.275
 Thanks, Dad.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.781
Hey.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.949
You did so good.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.367
[baby crying]

15:09.492 --> 15:11.286
 We're gonna play
helicopter, 'cause I

15:11.411 --> 15:13.913
know you like helicopters.

15:14.039 --> 15:17.792
OK, OK, OK.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.795
[groaning]

15:20.920 --> 15:21.629
[baby crying]

15:21.755 --> 15:24.132
 You OK?

15:24.257 --> 15:24.883
 Yeah.

15:25.008 --> 15:25.925
Oh, yeah.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.719
We were playing helicopter.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.805
I think it's-- I think it's time
somebody needs a change, so.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.057
 Yeah.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.475
Thanks, Dad.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.643
Hey, you're OK.

15:35.769 --> 15:36.644
Are you tired?

15:36.770 --> 15:37.645
Sleepy?

15:40.690 --> 15:43.026
 We had to scale a steep
ridge to get to him.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.819
It was amazing how fast
the wolf could travel

15:44.944 --> 15:46.071
with a bullet in his hip.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.322
 Well, did you
get it out in time?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.406
TY.
Yeah.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.532
It was touch and
go for a bit, but--

15:49.657 --> 15:50.575
- Sorry I'm late.
- --we did it.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.701
 Long practice session.

15:51.826 --> 15:52.619
 Practice?

15:52.744 --> 15:53.578
What does that mean?

15:53.703 --> 15:54.871
 Me and Avery.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.289
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.874
We started with
this one drill where

15:57.999 --> 15:59.501
I tied my rope around the
steer's horns and then we--

15:59.626 --> 16:00.835
 What?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.087
 We tied the rope
around the steer's horns.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.421
 You can't do that, Jade.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.090
You don't put a rope
around a steer's horns

16:05.215 --> 16:06.007
unless you hit your target.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.425
There's no shortcuts.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.635
JADE: It wasn't a shortcut.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.511
It was a training exercise.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.679
 It was stupid.

16:10.804 --> 16:11.846
And you probably set
yourself back further.

16:11.971 --> 16:12.931
Why wouldn't you ask me?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.016
I'm your coach.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.851
 I don't get it.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.062
Today you were all over us for
not putting in enough effort,

16:19.187 --> 16:20.313
and now you're
ticked off because we

16:20.438 --> 16:21.690
had an extra practice session?

16:21.815 --> 16:22.816
I can't win with you.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.192
JACK: She's got a point, Tim.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.653
You were pretty tough
on those guys today.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.738
CASEY: And you have to remember
these kids are still learning,

16:28.863 --> 16:29.989
honey.
- Yeah.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.116
You need to chill out.

16:31.241 --> 16:31.950
 What-- you know what?

16:32.075 --> 16:33.368
I'm sick of this.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.661
I'm sick of it.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.121
All of you think you
know how to run my rodeo

16:36.246 --> 16:36.996
school better than I do.

16:37.122 --> 16:37.956
You do.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.290
You, you.

16:39.416 --> 16:42.043
Even Caleb, who's at
some two-bit rodeo

16:42.168 --> 16:44.045
trying to last three seconds.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.505
You all think you can
do it better, right?

16:45.630 --> 16:47.716
Huh?

16:47.841 --> 16:48.842
Who needs me?

16:48.967 --> 16:49.884
JACK: Come on.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.886
 No, what do you need me for?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.054
 Tim.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.275
[guitar music]

17:05.400 --> 17:06.443
 OK.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.694
Well, thanks for
letting me know.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.448
Please, call
whenever you need to.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.490
OK.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.700
Bye.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.910
 What was that about?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.412
 Attila.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.247
[sighs] He's having some
respiratory problems.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.790
Can happen after long flights.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.001
 Is he gonna be OK?

17:23.126 --> 17:24.377
 I don't know.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.502
I mean, they're pretty
worried about him.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.253
They offered to
fly me out there.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.505
 Are you serious?

17:27.630 --> 17:29.215
That's pretty
expensive vet call.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.592
 That's what I said.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.595
Pretty sure I can help
them from here, so.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.972
 [sighs] I just hate to think
of Attila suffering in any way.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.932
He's been through so much.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.100
 [sighs] I know.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.190
 Hey, Jack, are you here?

17:45.315 --> 17:46.274
JACK: Come on in.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.363
Well, hello.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.572
 Hi.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.283
Look, we need to talk
to you about Tim.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.370
 Yeah, he's been
a nightmare lately.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.663
 Let me pour you a coffee.

18:00.789 --> 18:01.998
 I first noticed
that something was

18:02.123 --> 18:03.416
up when we were on the road.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.419
 Yeah, well, he never
did love long drives.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.212
 No, I know.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.755
Just-- [laughs] Trust me.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.423
But this is different.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.385
He was just-- he was
snapping at me for no reason.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.095
I mean, I was on
eggshells the whole time.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.221
 And you've seen
him at the school.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.305
He's been the exact same way.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.765
 And what was that last night?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.266
Over nothing?

18:20.392 --> 18:21.976
I mean, I have never seen
him like this before.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.438
 Neither have I. And I know
Tim can be difficult sometimes,

18:25.563 --> 18:27.649
but the way he's
been acting is just--

18:27.774 --> 18:28.483
I don't know.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.151
Like, just, it feels mean.

18:30.276 --> 18:34.572
 And I ask him what's going
on, and he just gets defensive.

18:34.698 --> 18:38.576
[sighs] Do you have any idea
where this is coming from?

18:38.702 --> 18:41.204
 OK.

18:41.329 --> 18:44.374
He does seem a little off.

18:44.499 --> 18:49.379
Now, I've seen-- well, I
just hope some old habits

18:49.504 --> 18:50.505
aren't coming back.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.718
[guitar music]

18:54.843 --> 18:56.469
 Well, would you mind
having a talk with him?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.348
He might open up to you.

19:04.227 --> 19:07.105
GEORGIE: Won't believe this
party I got invited to.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.106
WYATT: Why?

19:08.231 --> 19:09.649
What kind of party is it?

19:09.774 --> 19:11.568
GEORGIE: It's a barbecue
with all the top jumpers.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.777
WYATT: Oh, wow.
That's awesome.

19:12.902 --> 19:13.820
Congrats.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.655
GEORGIE: [laughs] It's not.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.324
It's being thrown by
this richy-rich lady

19:18.450 --> 19:20.618
in her fancy mansion.

19:20.744 --> 19:24.330
It's gonna be all champagne
fountains and barbecue caviar.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.624
WYATT: I don't think
you barbecue caviar.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.792
 [sighs] Whatever.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.128
It's-- it's gonna
be pretentious, OK?

19:30.253 --> 19:32.005
 And super funny.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.091
 I'm glad you think so, 'cause
I want you to go with me.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.051
 Yeah, sure.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.052
That sounds hilarious.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.053
 Great.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.764
Um, then it's a date.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.640
 Uh, yeah.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.642
Yes, sure.

19:44.768 --> 19:45.852
OK, OK.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.354
I want to test out
my new riding skills.

19:47.479 --> 19:48.563
I'll race you.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.023
I'll race you across
this, uh, field.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.901
 Actually, I was kind of
hoping we could, you know,

19:53.026 --> 19:55.904
talk about what's
happening with us.

19:56.029 --> 19:56.905
 You're scared.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.327
You're scared I'm
gonna beat you.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.704
Well, you should
be, because I am.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.663
Yah!

20:05.789 --> 20:07.665
[horses neighing]

20:07.791 --> 20:11.252
[guitar music]

20:21.346 --> 20:22.847
 I was excited
to get your call.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.849
 I want to show you
what Holloway can do.

20:24.974 --> 20:25.975
 That sounds promising.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.560
But why isn't he in
the jumping ring?

20:27.686 --> 20:29.145
 Well, I don't really
know how to say this,

20:29.270 --> 20:30.397
so I'm just gonna
come out with it.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.775
I-- I don't think
that Holloway's

20:33.900 --> 20:36.403
a jumper, at least not at
the level you're hoping for.

20:36.528 --> 20:37.445
 What are you talking about?

20:37.570 --> 20:38.613
That's what he was bred to do.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.031
 I know.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.283
But sometimes, no matter
what a horse is bred to do,

20:42.409 --> 20:43.743
they have a mind of their own.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.870
 And what exactly does
Holloway think he is?

20:45.995 --> 20:48.373
 [sighs] A bronc.

20:50.917 --> 20:51.960
 A rodeo animal?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.545
 I-- I just need you
to check this out.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.462
 Uh, no.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.464
I don't need to see anything.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.009
Get him out of this
pen this instant.

20:59.134 --> 21:01.886
You know, I can only imagine the
damage you've already caused.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.763
[guitar music]

21:03.888 --> 21:08.435
 [sighs]

21:08.560 --> 21:10.186
TIM: Anything happens
to my suspension,

21:10.311 --> 21:13.231
you'll be paying
for it, old man.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.483
You better not have brought
me all the way out here

21:15.608 --> 21:17.152
to help you grease a haybine.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.487
 No, I didn't.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.281
[sighs]

21:21.406 --> 21:22.532
 So what, you
just want to drone

21:22.657 --> 21:24.117
on about dinner last night?

21:24.242 --> 21:25.160
 No.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.162
Well, yeah, actually.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.788
That's part of it.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.458
You've been awful edgy lately,
and everyone's noticed.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.418
 Oh, so you're all
talking behind my back.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.504
 I did have a chat with Jade
and Casey this morning, yeah.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.089
 There you go,
riling everybody up.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.507
 They came to me.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.842
 And you just jumped
in and piled on.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.260
 Hey.

21:42.385 --> 21:46.181
They've never seen you like
this before, but I have.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.849
 Oh, you're accusing
me of something.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.518
 The moods, your
temper, the sunglasses.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.479
I'm just saying, where
there's smoke, there's fire.

21:52.604 --> 21:55.357
 I haven't had a
drink for five years!

21:55.482 --> 21:57.984
Or so much as a baby aspirin.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.028
Believe me, dealing
with your BS every day--

22:00.153 --> 22:01.446
it hasn't made it easy.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.240
I'm a clean machine, Jack.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.452
So forget your intervention
or any other crap

22:07.577 --> 22:08.870
you have planned.

22:08.995 --> 22:12.457
[guitar music]

22:24.678 --> 22:26.388
 I still can't
believe that woman.

22:26.513 --> 22:30.016
She totally just
blew off my advice.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.017
 Well, that's her loss.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.519
 No.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.187
Holloway's the one
that loses in all this.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.773
Paula's gonna keep forcing
him to be something he's not.

22:36.898 --> 22:39.818
And then when she finally
realizes he's not a jumper,

22:39.943 --> 22:41.444
then what?

22:41.569 --> 22:42.654
 Well, maybe you
should go back to her.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.823
Try speaking her language.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.282
 What do you mean?

22:46.408 --> 22:48.451
 Lay out how much she can
make with him as a bronc.

22:48.576 --> 22:52.747
Horse that expensive has got
to pay for himself somehow.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.708
 That's actually
a pretty good idea.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.543
Maybe I'll go to that
barbecue after all.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.591
 I got an update about Attila.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.344
 He's getting worse,
and they want you to go?

23:06.469 --> 23:07.762
 Yeah.

23:07.887 --> 23:12.017
And they offered to
pay for you to join me.

23:12.142 --> 23:13.893
 Are you serious?

23:14.019 --> 23:15.270
For how long?

23:15.395 --> 23:16.438
 About a week.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.985
 Mongolia.

23:22.110 --> 23:26.281
[laughs] Why not?

23:26.406 --> 23:28.616
 Really?

23:28.742 --> 23:30.452
 Yeah.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.078
We would have to talk
to Grandpa and Lisa

23:32.203 --> 23:34.789
and see if they could
look after Lyndy.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.499
Would be hard to
leave her for a week.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.711
But spending some time with
them would be good for her.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.756
 Yeah, you're right.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.133
I think Lyndy will be fine.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.593
Are you sure, though?

23:46.718 --> 23:48.261
 Ty, when there's an
opportunity like this that's

23:48.386 --> 23:51.931
paid for, we should take it.

23:52.057 --> 23:55.810
We would never go on an
adventure like this on our own.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.271
Plus I get to see the
famous Dr. Borden in action.

23:58.396 --> 24:03.818
 [laughs] OK.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.987
We're going to Mongolia then.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.739
 Yeah.

24:07.864 --> 24:08.490
 Together.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.993
[laughter]

24:15.872 --> 24:16.748
TIM: Hey.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.170
 Tim.

24:22.295 --> 24:25.048
Just want to say I'm
sorry, all right?

24:25.173 --> 24:27.384
I shouldn't have
jumped to conclusions.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.387
I believe you 100%.

24:30.512 --> 24:34.349
But if it ain't booze
or pills, just--

24:34.474 --> 24:36.101
I want to know what's going on.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.394
Maybe I can help.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.312
 [sighs] I don't
need your help.

24:39.437 --> 24:43.358
 Well, you can't keep whatever
this is all bottled up inside.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.110
 What are you, a therapist now?

24:45.235 --> 24:52.492
[groans]

24:52.617 --> 24:53.451
TIM: Don't-- don't.

24:53.576 --> 24:54.619
I'm fine.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.623
JACK: I don't know what
just happened there,

24:58.748 --> 25:02.210
but you need to get checked out.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.336
 I did already.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.338
 You expect me to believe that?

25:05.463 --> 25:07.048
 Ask Verani.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.509
I'm going back to see
her this afternoon.

25:09.634 --> 25:12.512
 What exactly are
you seeing her about?

25:12.637 --> 25:14.222
 I just-- it's nothing.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.391
I'm having headaches.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.977
I'm dizzy.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.688
The light is really
bugging my eyes.

25:21.813 --> 25:23.732
My hands are numb all the time.

25:23.857 --> 25:26.234
 Well, that doesn't
sound like nothing to me.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.403
What did she say about it?

25:28.528 --> 25:29.696
 She made me get an MRI.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.700
I'm pretty sure it's
just all the concussions

25:33.825 --> 25:35.535
I took in the rodeo.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.662
 Are you getting results today?

25:37.787 --> 25:40.498
 I don't know.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.751
[sighs] We'll see.

25:45.503 --> 25:49.341
You-- please, you can't
mention this to anybody, OK?

25:49.466 --> 25:50.383
Not a word.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.552
Especially not Casey.

25:52.677 --> 25:53.678
 All right.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.517
 Really?
OK.

25:59.642 --> 26:00.560
No, I-- I understand.

26:00.685 --> 26:03.938
I-- OK.

26:04.064 --> 26:04.856
Thank you.

26:04.981 --> 26:05.607
Bye.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.567
[phone beeps]

26:07.692 --> 26:08.693
 What's wrong?

26:08.818 --> 26:10.403
Lisa can't do it?

26:10.528 --> 26:11.446
 No, it's not that.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.697
It's my passport.

26:12.822 --> 26:13.615
It's expired.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.450
 [sighs] What?

26:15.575 --> 26:16.534
 I haven't used it in so long.

26:16.659 --> 26:17.911
I forgot to check.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.537
They're getting me
an emergency renewal,

26:19.662 --> 26:21.831
but it's gonna take a few days.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.083
 OK.

26:23.208 --> 26:23.958
We'll just leave as
soon as you get it.

26:24.084 --> 26:24.876
 No, Ty.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.753
Attila needs you now.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.130
I'll join you, but
you need to go.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.465
 Are you sure?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.343
 I [sighs] need the time
to get Lyndy ready, anyway.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.053
It'll all work out.

26:35.178 --> 26:36.680
 Well, I--

26:36.805 --> 26:38.598
I kind of wanted us to
fly together, you know?

26:38.723 --> 26:41.643
 Ty, we're still doing this.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.562
It's gonna be amazing, right?

26:44.688 --> 26:45.480
 Right.

26:45.605 --> 26:49.109

27:43.580 --> 27:45.123
 Hey, Katie.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.458
 Hey, Amy.

27:46.583 --> 27:47.375
 Georgie, you ready?

27:50.795 --> 27:52.255
 Is this OK?

27:52.380 --> 27:53.214
 You look amazing.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.513
 You look so pretty.

28:00.638 --> 28:01.681
 Thank you.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.394
 Is everything OK?

28:06.519 --> 28:07.729
 Yeah.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.939
It's just, I'm kind
of mad at Wyatt.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.608
I thought he'd come pick
me up like a real date,

28:11.733 --> 28:13.568
but instead we're
meeting him there.

28:13.693 --> 28:16.029
He's just been so cold lately.

28:16.154 --> 28:20.325
 I have a feeling that
dress might warm him up.

28:20.450 --> 28:23.912
[classical music, chatter]

28:33.046 --> 28:34.673
 Wow.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.092
AMY: Yeah.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.260
 This is so over the top.

28:39.386 --> 28:42.597
They might as well be using
$100 bills for napkins.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.934
 [clears throat]

28:47.852 --> 28:50.605
 That's a-- that's
a great dress.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.233
 Thanks.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.275
PAULA: Well, hello.

28:54.401 --> 28:57.445
This is a nice surprise.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.573
[laughs] Hey.

29:00.699 --> 29:02.617
 Um, this is--

29:02.742 --> 29:03.576
this is Wyatt.

29:03.702 --> 29:04.536
 Hi.

29:04.661 --> 29:05.954
Nice to meet you.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.539
 You have to meet my daughter.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.708
Uh, Peyton!

29:09.833 --> 29:10.875
Come here, please.

29:16.715 --> 29:17.424
This is Amy Fleming.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.299
 Hi.

29:18.425 --> 29:19.634
 Oh, hi.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.136
 And Georgie.

29:21.261 --> 29:23.763
She's riding Val
Stanton's horse, Flame.

29:23.888 --> 29:27.017
Why don't you, uh, introduce
her around to the other girls.

29:27.142 --> 29:27.767
 OK.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.227
Come on.

29:29.352 --> 29:30.645
 [laughs]

29:30.770 --> 29:31.646
 Don't worry about me.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.232
Just-- OK, I'll mingle.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.317
 Paula, thank you
for inviting me.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.278
I really wanted the chance to
talk to you about Holloway.

29:38.403 --> 29:39.112
 Oh, I'm sorry.

29:39.237 --> 29:40.280
[laughs] Will you excuse me?

29:48.079 --> 29:49.622
LAINY: Just seeing her
hair was like a hack job.

29:49.748 --> 29:50.665
It was like a dog chewed it off.

29:50.790 --> 29:51.666
Cannot even--

29:51.791 --> 29:54.044
 Lainy, meet Georgie.

29:54.169 --> 29:56.338
 Oh, you were in
Okotoks, weren't you?

29:56.463 --> 29:57.422
 Yeah.

29:57.547 --> 29:58.631
Yeah, it was a nice show.

29:58.757 --> 29:59.591
 Seriously?

29:59.716 --> 30:00.884
It was so budget.

30:01.009 --> 30:02.218
 I didn't even bother
going this year.

30:02.344 --> 30:03.762
I was at a show in
the South of France.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.305
 See, that must have been nice.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.639
 The Belgian circuits
are way better.

30:06.765 --> 30:07.557
And the stables?

30:07.682 --> 30:08.808
To die for.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.436
 So how do you two
know each other?

30:11.561 --> 30:13.480
 Oh, we just met.

30:13.605 --> 30:15.899
Her trainer's the one who's
been working with my horse.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.776
 Oh, you mean the
one who thought

30:17.901 --> 30:19.361
he should be a rodeo bronc.

30:19.486 --> 30:20.612
[laughs]

30:20.737 --> 30:22.614
 Come on, be nice.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.616
I always fancied Holloway as
more of a Chuckwagon type.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.117
[laughter]

30:26.242 --> 30:27.744
 Um, it was nice
meeting you guys.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.204
Um, I should find
my friend, though.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.376
LAINY: [sighs] Where
did she come from?

30:34.501 --> 30:36.544
 My mom.

30:36.670 --> 30:37.462
 I'll see you.

30:37.587 --> 30:38.380
 See you.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.464
 Hey, you.

30:39.589 --> 30:40.965
Having fun?

30:41.091 --> 30:44.052
 Uh, I mean, yeah.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.554
But it's pretty lame.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.139
 I know, right?

30:48.264 --> 30:49.683
Come on.
Have a seat.

30:49.808 --> 30:51.184
You can hide out
here for a while.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.818
So not your scene, huh?

30:59.943 --> 31:01.528
 Nah, not really.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.905
I just met Paula's
prissy little daughter

31:04.030 --> 31:05.865
Peyton and her friends.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.993
 Yeah, Peyton can be a handful.

31:09.119 --> 31:10.995
Always some kind
of drama with her.

31:11.121 --> 31:13.248
Wears me out.

31:13.373 --> 31:16.251
 Are you and Peyton
friends or something?

31:16.376 --> 31:18.878
 Um, no.

31:19.004 --> 31:21.840
Um, she's my cousin.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.341
 Oh.

31:23.466 --> 31:25.385
Oh, so that-- that
means Paula's your--

31:25.510 --> 31:26.094
 Yep.

31:26.219 --> 31:27.345
She's my dear auntie.

31:31.641 --> 31:34.060
Moved out a year ago
to live with them.

31:34.185 --> 31:36.396
Needed a change of scenery.

31:36.521 --> 31:37.188
 Oh.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.481
I-- I always just--

31:38.606 --> 31:39.399
I thought--

31:39.524 --> 31:41.693
 I was just some stable hand?

31:41.818 --> 31:42.694
 No, I just--

31:42.819 --> 31:44.696
 [laughs] It's OK.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.656
I'll take that as a compliment.

31:46.781 --> 31:49.117
It means I don't have
that patented Westfield

31:49.242 --> 31:50.326
stick up the butt aura.

31:50.452 --> 31:51.870
[laughter]

31:51.995 --> 31:53.872
 Oh, here you are.

31:53.997 --> 31:55.290
 Wyatt.

31:55.415 --> 31:56.374
I-- I've been looking
everywhere for you.

31:56.499 --> 31:57.125
 Yeah.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.293
Yeah, it looks like it.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.715
 I have to go.

32:03.840 --> 32:07.677
 [laughs]

32:07.802 --> 32:10.638
 Wyatt, where are you going?

32:10.764 --> 32:11.681
 What was that?

32:11.806 --> 32:13.141
- Nothing.
- Really?

32:13.266 --> 32:14.476
 That's Paula's nephew.

32:14.601 --> 32:16.102
He's been to the
ranch a couple times.

32:16.227 --> 32:17.812
 Well, I see that you
guys have become friendly.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.314
 Why do you even care?

32:19.439 --> 32:21.983
You've been avoiding me
ever since we kissed.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.651
Yeah, we kissed!

32:23.777 --> 32:25.028
You kissed me.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.279
And ever since,
you've been pretending

32:26.404 --> 32:27.447
like it never even happened.

32:27.572 --> 32:29.324
 Mm.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.325
No, that's not--

32:33.203 --> 32:36.623
[sighs] I'm sorry.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.667
I know that I've been acting
a little weird lately.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.668
 Why?

32:39.793 --> 32:41.336
What's going on?

32:41.461 --> 32:45.924
The truth is is that I want
you to be my girlfriend.

32:46.049 --> 32:47.008
 Then why--

32:47.133 --> 32:49.052
 Because it's complicated, OK?

32:49.177 --> 32:50.470
There's this girl
back in Calgary,

32:50.595 --> 32:53.932
and she sort of thinks
that she's my girlfriend.

32:54.057 --> 32:55.058
 Why would she think that?

32:55.183 --> 32:56.601
 Because she was.

32:56.726 --> 33:00.855
And technically she still
is, because I haven't

33:00.980 --> 33:02.273
exactly broken up with her yet.

33:02.399 --> 33:03.400
 What?

33:03.525 --> 33:04.818
 I just don't know
how to do it, OK?

33:04.943 --> 33:06.695
That's-- I-- I'm terrible
with that kind of thing.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.530
- I feel totally played by you.
- No, Georgie.

33:08.655 --> 33:09.948
It's not like that, OK?
Listen--

33:10.073 --> 33:11.366
 No, stop.
Stop.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.784
Just go.

33:12.909 --> 33:14.327
 That kiss meant something
to me too, you know.

33:20.125 --> 33:23.545
[guitar music]

33:26.506 --> 33:28.341
 Hey.

33:28.466 --> 33:29.467
 Hey.

33:29.592 --> 33:30.927
 You didn't return
my call last night.

33:31.052 --> 33:31.970
 Long day.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.388
I just hit the sack early.

33:33.513 --> 33:34.806
[phone ringing]

33:34.931 --> 33:37.308
Uh, excuse me.

33:37.434 --> 33:38.560
Ah.

33:38.685 --> 33:39.352
Jack, hey.

33:39.477 --> 33:40.895
Uh, I'll take the horse.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.063
Can you get this stuff?

33:46.693 --> 33:47.861
 Casey.

33:47.986 --> 33:49.154
 So did you talk to him?

33:49.279 --> 33:50.739
 Yeah, I did.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.365
 And?

33:52.490 --> 33:55.910
 Well, he says he's not
drinking, and I believe him.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.037
 Well, that's a relief.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.708
So what's this all about, then?

34:01.833 --> 34:03.335
 It's been busy lately.

34:03.460 --> 34:04.836
You know how he gets.

34:04.961 --> 34:05.754
He'll come around.

34:08.672 --> 34:11.176
 Well, then I hope
you're right, for his

34:11.301 --> 34:12.761
sake and everyone else's.

34:12.886 --> 34:16.348
[guitar music]

34:17.139 --> 34:20.393
[chatter]

34:20.518 --> 34:21.478
 OK.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.063
Let's get it right
this time, Jade.

34:23.188 --> 34:25.565
Just keep it fluid.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.025
You got it?

34:27.150 --> 34:27.984
 Yah, yah!

34:28.109 --> 34:28.985
 Yah, yah!

34:29.110 --> 34:30.527
[horses whinnying]

34:30.652 --> 34:32.614
[mooing]

34:39.661 --> 34:40.580
[mooing]

34:40.705 --> 34:41.664
TIM: Made it, made it!
Good job!

34:41.790 --> 34:42.540
[cheering]

34:42.665 --> 34:43.625
Yeah!

34:43.750 --> 34:44.708
That's it!

34:44.833 --> 34:45.627
That's better.

34:45.752 --> 34:46.920
So much better.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.922
OK, you still got a little
room for improvement,

34:49.047 --> 34:51.132
but got a bright future.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.759
OK, everybody.

34:52.884 --> 34:53.927
Great start.

34:54.052 --> 34:55.136
But stay in the groove.

34:59.641 --> 35:00.350
 Thank you.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.936
[classical music, chatter]

35:03.061 --> 35:04.312
 Can we go?

35:04.437 --> 35:05.897
 I've been ready to
go since we got here.

35:06.022 --> 35:08.942
But I still haven't had a
chance to talk to Paula yet.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.276
Let me try one more time.
- OK.

35:10.402 --> 35:11.403
I'll be in the truck.

35:16.741 --> 35:19.077
PAULA: Tyler is so thrilled
that you could make it here.

35:19.202 --> 35:21.579
Did you happen to see where
we expanded the property?

35:21.705 --> 35:22.831
 Paula.

35:22.956 --> 35:23.957
Sorry.

35:24.082 --> 35:26.626
Can I talk to you for a moment?

35:26.751 --> 35:27.627
 Excuse me.

35:27.752 --> 35:28.878
Just one moment.

35:29.004 --> 35:31.006
Thank you.

35:31.131 --> 35:32.549
 I want to apologize.

35:32.674 --> 35:34.801
I should have never sprung
the idea of Holloway

35:34.926 --> 35:36.761
being a bronc on you.

35:36.886 --> 35:39.180
 I'm glad you realize what
a ridiculous notion that was.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.849
 No, I-- I still stand by it.

35:40.974 --> 35:43.143
He's definitely more of a
bucking horse than a jumper.

35:43.268 --> 35:44.269
- OK--
- Please, please.

35:44.394 --> 35:46.896
Just hear me out.

35:47.022 --> 35:49.524
I know that this isn't
what you want to hear.

35:49.649 --> 35:51.234
I'm sure you have high
hopes for Holloway.

35:51.359 --> 35:55.905
But do you know how much money
he could make as a bronc?

35:56.031 --> 35:57.490
 What are you talking about?

35:57.615 --> 35:59.284
 Well into the six figures.

35:59.409 --> 36:02.579
And that's at
every rodeo season.

36:02.704 --> 36:04.831
 You don't expect me to
ferry him around that circuit,

36:04.956 --> 36:05.665
do you?

36:05.790 --> 36:06.666
 No.

36:06.791 --> 36:08.209
I have connections.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.545
And if you wanted, you could
sell them to a stock contractor

36:10.670 --> 36:12.172
for a pretty good profit.

36:16.468 --> 36:17.719
 I should get
back to my guests.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.559
Let me think about this, OK?

36:24.684 --> 36:25.560
 Thanks.

36:25.685 --> 36:28.897
[guitar music]

36:33.777 --> 36:34.903
 I'll be back
before you know it.

36:35.028 --> 36:38.573
OK, sweetheart?

36:38.698 --> 36:40.200
Yeah, come here.

36:40.325 --> 36:42.994
You come here.

36:43.119 --> 36:44.287
[baby crying]

36:44.412 --> 36:46.998
I'm gonna miss you
like I always do.

36:47.123 --> 36:48.917
It's OK.

36:49.042 --> 36:51.920
It's OK.

36:52.045 --> 36:54.214
But I got a trick
this time, Lyndy.

36:56.883 --> 37:01.888
Every morning, I'm gonna
watch the sun rising.

37:02.013 --> 37:05.600
And I'm gonna imagine it
setting here at Heartland.

37:05.725 --> 37:09.270
And I'll picture you all
cuddled up with your lamby,

37:09.396 --> 37:10.438
drifting off to sleep.

37:12.816 --> 37:13.900
[cooing]

37:14.025 --> 37:18.988
 When that same sun
goes down at night,

37:19.114 --> 37:24.744
I'll picture your smiling face
waking up to start the new day.

37:24.869 --> 37:25.745
OK?

37:30.709 --> 37:32.293
I love you, sweetheart.

37:35.505 --> 37:37.966
[horse whinnying]

37:56.276 --> 37:58.570
 You missed your appointment.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.071
 Oh, I'm sorry about that.

38:00.196 --> 38:01.156
The day got away from me.

38:01.281 --> 38:02.657
 I've been trying to call you.

38:02.782 --> 38:05.702
 Well, like I said, I was busy.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.537
 This is too important
to avoid, Tim.

38:07.662 --> 38:10.582
 Well, I already know what
you're gonna say, Trish.

38:10.707 --> 38:15.920
I-- I did some reading about
post-concussion syndrome.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.464
I get it.

38:17.589 --> 38:19.466
There's not much
you can do about it.

38:19.591 --> 38:21.301
I'm just gonna have to
live with the symptoms,

38:21.426 --> 38:23.636
and that's just the way it is.

38:23.762 --> 38:25.013
 Something showed
up on your MRI.

38:27.766 --> 38:28.808
There seems to be a shadow.

38:32.062 --> 38:33.146
 A sh-- a shadow?

38:33.271 --> 38:34.356
What does that mean?

38:34.481 --> 38:35.940
 It means it's a tumor.

38:38.902 --> 38:39.778
 A tumor.

38:45.241 --> 38:46.034
I have cancer?

38:54.584 --> 38:55.502
 I didn't say it was cancer.

38:55.627 --> 38:56.670
 You said tumor.

38:56.795 --> 38:58.421
 And it could be
completely benign.

38:58.546 --> 39:00.256
Maybe it's something that's
been there for a long time,

39:00.382 --> 39:02.133
but has absolutely nothing
to do with your symptoms.

39:02.258 --> 39:03.385
 What if it's not benign?

39:03.510 --> 39:04.427
How do you know?

39:04.552 --> 39:06.012
 I want to do another MRI.

39:06.137 --> 39:07.514
 Oh.

39:07.639 --> 39:12.060
 But that usually isn't
conclusive on its own.

39:12.185 --> 39:13.395
 OK, so then what?

39:16.564 --> 39:19.651
 We'd need to go
in and remove it.

39:19.776 --> 39:20.735
I have to warn you.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.070
There are some pretty big risks.

39:22.195 --> 39:24.739
That kind of surgery
can cause other issues.

39:24.864 --> 39:27.158
It can affect your
sight, your smell, taste.

39:27.283 --> 39:29.202
It can cause neural
damage, partial paralysis.

39:29.327 --> 39:30.161
 OK.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.746
I-- I get it.

39:31.871 --> 39:33.707
TRICIA: But if it's cancer,
Tim, it needs to come

39:33.832 --> 39:34.916
out as soon as possible.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.050
Look, I can line up a
counselor for you to talk to.

39:44.175 --> 39:45.802
Help you make the decision
about the surgery,

39:45.927 --> 39:47.095
if it even comes to that.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.806
 No, I don't need
a counselor, Trish.

39:49.931 --> 39:53.601
I-- I'm not gonna risk my
entire way of life on the chance

39:53.727 --> 39:55.270
that I might have cancer.

39:55.395 --> 39:59.899
And I'm not gonna let
anybody operate on my brain.

40:00.025 --> 40:01.026
No.

40:01.151 --> 40:02.736
No way.

40:02.861 --> 40:05.113
 OK, let's-- let's just take
it one step at a time then.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.909
I trust that you're
not gonna mention this?

40:10.035 --> 40:11.244
Not to Jade?

40:11.369 --> 40:12.829
Not to Casey?

40:12.954 --> 40:13.747
 Of course.

40:13.872 --> 40:14.706
TIM: Please.

40:21.087 --> 40:22.297
Trish.

40:22.422 --> 40:23.548
 Yeah?

40:23.673 --> 40:24.632
 Can I still drive?

40:27.177 --> 40:29.679
 We don't know
what this is, Tim.

40:29.804 --> 40:31.306
Use common sense.

40:31.431 --> 40:33.933
Just be careful.

 No, we don't.

41:18.436 --> 41:19.479
 That was Paula.

41:19.604 --> 41:21.147
She agreed.

41:21.272 --> 41:23.191
She's gonna have Holloway
trained as a saddle bronc.

41:23.316 --> 41:24.317
 Nice job.

41:24.442 --> 41:26.403
I knew you could do it.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.446
 And you, Mister,
are gonna be late.

41:28.571 --> 41:29.864
You have a plane to catch.

41:29.989 --> 41:30.865
 I know.

41:30.990 --> 41:32.242
I know.

41:32.367 --> 41:33.785
I just want to spend
every last moment

41:33.910 --> 41:35.370
I can with my little girl.

41:35.495 --> 41:36.496
 What about this girl?

[cooing]

41:37.539 --> 41:38.665

41:38.790 --> 41:40.166
 I'll see you in
a couple of days.

41:40.291 --> 41:41.167
 I can't believe it.

41:41.292 --> 41:42.460
I am so excited.

41:42.585 --> 41:43.503
This is gonna be an
amazing adventure.

JACK: You ready to go?

41:47.132 --> 41:47.882
 Yeah.

41:48.008 --> 41:49.134
Yeah.

41:49.259 --> 41:50.677
 Come on.

41:50.802 --> 41:51.803
 OK.

41:51.928 --> 41:52.846
 Yes.

41:52.971 --> 41:54.180
