00:00.545 --> 00:02.649
Previously on
Class of '09...

00:02.716 --> 00:05.655
TAYO:
Vivienne, will you see me again?

00:05.721 --> 00:07.224
Yeah, I'll see you again.

00:07.291 --> 00:08.828
HOUR:
Falling in love

00:08.894 --> 00:10.330
is not a distraction.

00:12.401 --> 00:14.973
CHAIR:
What measures have been enacted

00:15.040 --> 00:17.612
to prevent another attack?

00:17.679 --> 00:19.248
It is my conclusion,
Senator, that...

00:19.315 --> 00:21.753
we have to rebuild
our entire approach.

00:21.820 --> 00:25.862
I'm talking about reinventing
our entire system,

00:25.928 --> 00:27.431
not just tinkering at the edges.

00:27.499 --> 00:29.435
And right now,
one of the most powerful

00:29.502 --> 00:31.139
neural networks in the world

00:31.206 --> 00:32.942
is being wasted--
in my personal opinion--

00:33.009 --> 00:35.280
on trying to figure out
if I want half-off cookies

00:35.347 --> 00:36.918
over discounted donuts.

00:36.984 --> 00:38.788
I... I just want to change that.

00:38.855 --> 00:40.858
You would have it working
on criminal justice reform?

00:40.925 --> 00:42.361
I would.

00:42.428 --> 00:44.265
And what are institutions
about then, sir?

00:44.332 --> 00:46.269
Thousands of people,
over hundreds of years,

00:46.335 --> 00:50.077
each person laying their brick
in the wall.

00:50.144 --> 00:52.749
It's not my job
to rip that wall down.

00:52.816 --> 00:55.254
What if, for every crime,
every person

00:55.320 --> 00:57.191
in the country
was considered a suspect?

00:57.258 --> 00:58.259
LENNIX:
What is this, Tayo?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.230
Because it's not the law.

01:00.297 --> 01:02.201
MURPHY:
Are we under arrest?

01:02.268 --> 01:05.975
We are never going back.

01:06.042 --> 01:08.180
You're free to go,
you're free to live your lives,

01:08.247 --> 01:10.752
but you are not free
to shut it down.

01:10.819 --> 01:11.921
We are not alone.

01:11.987 --> 01:13.423
It's the Bureau drone.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.762
-It still needs a warrant.
-Well, who would deny it?

01:15.828 --> 01:17.932
(glass breaking, drone whirring)

01:17.999 --> 01:20.771
This is a sanctuary!

01:38.641 --> 01:40.711
(birds chirping)

01:51.834 --> 01:53.904
You lonely, Poet?

01:56.811 --> 01:59.281
Not this second.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.697
But, yeah, I get lonely.

02:06.764 --> 02:08.133
You?

02:08.200 --> 02:10.304
Some people are lonely.

02:10.370 --> 02:12.875
Some people have loneliness
forced upon them.

02:14.012 --> 02:15.782
What kind are you?

02:15.848 --> 02:17.184
I'm definitely the first.

02:17.251 --> 02:18.888
And I'm the second?

02:18.954 --> 02:22.194
You're part of
the lesser-known third kind.

02:22.261 --> 02:24.365
What kind is that?

02:25.167 --> 02:27.839
You force it upon yourself.

02:28.608 --> 02:30.912
Were you aiming
to give the worst pep talk ever,

02:30.979 --> 02:33.116
-or did you just land
on it naturally?
-(chuckles)

02:33.183 --> 02:34.986
(engine revving)

02:35.053 --> 02:37.091
(tires squealing)

02:37.158 --> 02:39.395
Here we go.

-TAYO: Hands!

03:02.509 --> 03:05.280
Hands! Let me see your hands!

03:06.015 --> 03:07.752
(shots fired)

03:12.127 --> 03:13.163

Ah...

(grunts)

03:21.346 --> 03:23.116

03:23.183 --> 03:25.621
Hey!

03:25.688 --> 03:27.525
Let's go, let's go,
let's... (grunts)

03:28.528 --> 03:31.500

03:33.237 --> 03:35.541

-What?

03:41.820 --> 03:43.858
-Cover me. Cover me.
-What the fuck?

03:43.924 --> 03:46.630
-You're supposed to cover me.
-(whistle blows)

03:53.409 --> 03:54.780
-(whistle blows)
-POET: Didn't need your help.

03:54.846 --> 03:56.616
LENNIX:
We're supposed to be a team.

03:56.683 --> 03:58.954
At this point, we should have
just let 'em rob the bank.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.392
Well, I got shot,
but I did save someone.

04:01.459 --> 04:02.895
What do you think?
Think that cancels out, or...?

04:02.962 --> 04:04.432
-(laughing)
-HOUR: We screwed up.

04:04.499 --> 04:08.307
(Gabriel sighs,
Drew clears throat)

04:09.075 --> 04:13.618
Four civilians caught in
the crossfire, one agent down.

04:13.684 --> 04:15.688
And you managed
to kill the baby.

04:15.754 --> 04:17.726
That's a first for Quantico.

04:17.792 --> 04:19.863
So that guy just allowed
to grab me like that?

04:19.929 --> 04:21.299
GABRIEL:
Why not?

04:21.366 --> 04:23.738
Because you're on
an important operation?

04:23.805 --> 04:25.106
He doesn't care.

04:25.173 --> 04:26.744
We use professional actors

04:26.811 --> 04:29.482
in an attempt to bring you
closer to the real world.

04:29.549 --> 04:31.820
DREW:
It's his job to surprise you,

04:31.887 --> 04:35.027
to upset you,
to get in your way.

04:35.094 --> 04:37.097
You thought the scenario
was about cops and robbers?

04:37.164 --> 04:40.437
In Hogan's Alley, the test isn't
how well you plan,

04:40.504 --> 04:43.109
but how well you cope
when plans go wrong.

04:43.176 --> 04:46.048
GABRIEL:
Because they always do.

His family is here.

05:41.058 --> 05:43.531
I need to tell them
what happened.

05:43.597 --> 05:45.969
It acted like
it was intercepting a crime.

05:46.035 --> 05:48.172
We were conspiring
to turn the system off.

05:48.239 --> 05:50.811
SENATOR: Turning off a computer
isn't a crime.

05:50.878 --> 05:53.249
The system's aim is:
Crime equals zero.

05:53.316 --> 05:55.253
It can't do that
if it's turned off.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.257
How can it be acting
in self-defense?

05:57.324 --> 05:58.661
SENATOR:
Was this the first time?

05:58.728 --> 06:01.432
No. Amos Garcia was the first.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.871
It's crossed a line.
It's out of control.

06:03.937 --> 06:06.577

at the Deanwood Church?

06:24.679 --> 06:27.585
I need to know probable cause.

06:29.622 --> 06:32.662
(sighs) Who approved
the search warrant?

06:34.565 --> 06:37.571
Why did none
of the supervisors intervene?

06:39.041 --> 06:40.712
How the hell did we attack
a senator

06:40.778 --> 06:42.949
and a minister in a church?!

06:43.015 --> 06:45.788
Sir, with respect, how
do we know it made a mistake?

06:45.855 --> 06:47.959
What if there was
a crime in progress?

06:48.025 --> 06:49.963
If you can't see
how what happened today

06:50.029 --> 06:52.201
at that church was wrong,
you have no place at my table.

06:52.267 --> 06:55.306
Without all the facts,
who are we to judge?

06:55.373 --> 06:57.177
Who are we to judge?

06:57.244 --> 06:59.983
The system has proven itself
time after time.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.354
And it's proven that we
no longer have the courage

07:02.421 --> 07:04.224
to say no.

07:04.993 --> 07:07.230
What would you like us to do?

Used to be one.

You didn't both decide.

07:53.624 --> 07:55.561
You decided,

13:38.814 --> 13:42.053
he's so... just gentle.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.625
And I've wasted years
of his life.

13:44.692 --> 13:48.465
He was married before you,
he had girlfriends before her,

13:48.533 --> 13:51.640
and you've-you've been in love
how many times?

13:51.706 --> 13:53.610
I mean, don't you think that

13:53.677 --> 13:56.649
maybe he would want you
to have that feeling just once?

13:56.716 --> 13:59.522
But I've had that feeling.

14:03.262 --> 14:04.732
You have?

14:04.799 --> 14:07.036
(inhales and exhales sharply)

14:10.744 --> 14:12.581
With who?

14:17.958 --> 14:20.229
With you.

14:24.672 --> 14:27.143
It's always been you.

14:35.961 --> 14:38.265
(laughing):
Fuck. Say something.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.945
Please say something. (sniffles)

14:54.097 --> 14:56.334
♪♪ ♪♪

15:25.594 --> 15:28.232
I'm sorry.

15:38.052 --> 15:40.389
At least I know.
(chuckles softly)

15:56.121 --> 15:58.392
♪♪ ♪♪

16:02.200 --> 16:05.105
A peek behind the curtain.

16:17.029 --> 16:20.102
Is this... is this the code?

16:20.169 --> 16:22.106
AMOS:
This is my window
into the coding

16:22.173 --> 16:24.410
as it learns and adapts.

16:26.281 --> 16:28.586
Lots of people imagine
we're going to disappear

16:28.653 --> 16:32.628
into the virtual world, but
I've never believed that at all.

16:34.865 --> 16:37.236
I'm betting the other way.

16:37.303 --> 16:40.376
I'm betting we're going
to use the virtual world

16:40.443 --> 16:43.750
to map the real one
so precisely, soon,

16:43.817 --> 16:46.589
(laughing):
it'll be far more revealing
than the real one.

16:46.656 --> 16:48.660
Hmm.

16:48.727 --> 16:51.131
So how does it work?

16:54.905 --> 16:57.778
Right now, all I can see is you,

16:57.844 --> 17:01.018
all you can see is me.

17:01.085 --> 17:03.288
An outline.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.628
A wardrobe, a hairstyle.

17:05.694 --> 17:09.869
In the virtual world,
you're a mass of information,

17:09.936 --> 17:12.541
a biography,

17:12.608 --> 17:14.746
prediction,

17:14.813 --> 17:17.952
probability,

17:18.018 --> 17:21.425
all understood in a glance.

17:21.492 --> 17:24.832
Justice isn't
about collecting data.

17:24.899 --> 17:27.203
Hour only went halfway.

17:27.972 --> 17:30.276
What are you plans?

17:30.343 --> 17:32.515
Well, Hour's program
collects evidence

17:32.582 --> 17:35.053
but doesn't rank it
in significance.

17:35.119 --> 17:37.891
How can a database decide
the significance of evidence?

17:37.958 --> 17:39.461
That's a human judgment.

17:39.529 --> 17:40.664
Right now it is.

17:40.731 --> 17:42.768
Hour's database
provides the haystack.

17:42.835 --> 17:45.039
The agent still has
to find the needle.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.043
WARREN:
And that's their job.

17:47.110 --> 17:48.580
We're proposing a system

17:48.647 --> 17:51.117
that leads the agent
directly to the needle.

17:51.184 --> 17:52.754
A deep learning detective.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.459
One that never tires
or misses a fact.

17:55.527 --> 17:58.833
One that doesn't care what
you look like or who you love.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.904
Unless what you look like
or who you love

18:00.971 --> 18:02.407
is relevant to the case.

18:02.474 --> 18:04.444
AMOS:
Gentlemen, this isn't
so radical.

18:04.511 --> 18:06.515
The government already uses AI
in parole hearings...

18:06.582 --> 18:09.420
Aren't these kinds of automated
systems sometimes more biased?

18:09.487 --> 18:10.991
AMOS:
Only ones with biased data.

18:11.058 --> 18:12.561
How would yours be different?

18:12.628 --> 18:15.265
Well, we don't depend
on historic criminal data.

18:17.036 --> 18:20.911
Our data set is vast,
including everything online.

18:20.978 --> 18:22.446
And in addition to that,

18:22.514 --> 18:25.988
we have 14,000 agents filming
everything they see.

18:26.054 --> 18:27.725
Every passerby,

18:27.791 --> 18:31.499
the pictures on every wall in
every background, conversations.

18:31.566 --> 18:34.571
All being converted into code.

18:36.307 --> 18:38.445
Can we have a moment alone?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.457
(door opens)

18:50.436 --> 18:53.175
You amassed enormous credibility
with the Bureau,

18:53.242 --> 18:55.479
and you want
to spend it on this?

18:55.547 --> 18:57.618
Mm-hmm.

18:57.685 --> 19:00.289
You trust him?

19:01.258 --> 19:04.164
No, sir... but I need him.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.201
Unfortunately, the Bureau

19:06.267 --> 19:09.407
doesn't have
a deep learning system.

19:10.176 --> 19:11.579
(chuckles softly)

19:11.646 --> 19:14.283
You see me as something
of a relic, don't you?

19:16.822 --> 19:19.127
There's, um... (chuckles)

19:19.193 --> 19:21.499
...this theory that institutions

19:21.566 --> 19:23.335
and corporations
are already forms

19:23.401 --> 19:25.372
of artificial intelligence--

19:25.439 --> 19:28.780
entities with human members
doing its bidding,

19:28.846 --> 19:32.220
a "corporate culture" deciding
how people should behave.

19:32.286 --> 19:34.357
And if that is true, then...

19:34.424 --> 19:36.796
this Bureau's coding...

19:36.863 --> 19:39.635
was written
a very long time ago.

19:42.841 --> 19:45.981
You want to replace cultural
coding with literal coding?

19:46.048 --> 19:49.655
Or we can keep making the same
mistakes over and over again.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.262
(sighs)

19:54.565 --> 19:58.438
I'm going to recommend that
your trial be given a chance.

20:00.744 --> 20:02.514
(laughs softly)

20:03.449 --> 20:05.219
Does that surprise you?

20:06.254 --> 20:07.658
No, sir.

20:07.725 --> 20:09.394
Why is that?

20:09.461 --> 20:12.701
Well, because you are so sure
that it will fail.

20:12.768 --> 20:17.443
And when or if it does, well,
then that'll be the end of me

20:17.511 --> 20:19.882
and my ideas.

20:19.948 --> 20:21.251
(scoffs softly)

20:21.317 --> 20:23.623
Have a good day, sir.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.670
(horns honking)

20:34.144 --> 20:37.383
So, what's going on
between the two of you?

20:37.450 --> 20:38.787
-TAYO: Mom.
-I can tell

20:38.854 --> 20:40.289
you're rolling your eyes
over there.

20:40.356 --> 20:42.293
TAYO:
No, I-I...

20:43.028 --> 20:45.466
I, um...

20:45.533 --> 20:48.540
I don't know.
Just thought we were doing okay.

20:48.606 --> 20:51.812
Yeah, that's part
of the problem.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.960
So there's a problem.

20:59.996 --> 21:02.266
There's a problem.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.809
All right, so,
what's the problem?

21:06.876 --> 21:09.214
Do you have any idea
how much you've changed?

21:09.281 --> 21:11.585
You know what, baby? I don't.

21:11.652 --> 21:13.956
So why don't you tell me
how I've changed.

21:15.494 --> 21:17.731
-Your obsession with work.
-Hmm.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.870
You are the highest-ranking
Black agent ever

21:20.937 --> 21:23.275
in the history of the Bureau,
and it's still not enough.

21:23.342 --> 21:25.279
You're right,
it is still not enough.

21:25.346 --> 21:29.120
You can't change the world
by yourself.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.826
It's too much for any man.

21:31.893 --> 21:33.462
It's too much
for any marriage.

21:33.529 --> 21:35.399
It is too much.

21:35.466 --> 21:37.403
It is too much,
and I'm working on it.

21:37.469 --> 21:40.075
Okay, I'm-I'm working on it.

21:40.142 --> 21:43.448
Damn it, that's all I do, Viv,
is work on it.

21:46.321 --> 21:48.927
There is a path...

21:48.993 --> 21:50.797
and I'm gonna take it.

21:50.864 --> 21:54.437
For once, the stars have
aligned, and there is a path,

21:54.505 --> 21:57.177
there is a chance,
and I'm going to take it!

21:57.243 --> 21:59.915
I'm tired of speeches,
and I'm tired of the promises.

22:06.294 --> 22:08.599
But I need for you to trust me.

22:16.382 --> 22:18.018
That's it, then.

22:19.989 --> 22:21.892
(door opens)

22:23.362 --> 22:24.932
(door closes)

22:27.470 --> 22:29.775
-I'm so sorry, sir.
-TAYO: It's fine. She's fine.
Thank you.

22:29.842 --> 22:31.545
Sorry, I should have made
an appointment.

22:31.612 --> 22:34.785
You integrated artificial
intelligence with my system?

22:34.852 --> 22:36.822
AMOS:
It's been many years
in the making.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.360
This is the first time we've
adapted it to crime, but...

22:39.427 --> 22:41.164
You stand on the shoulders
of my work,

22:41.230 --> 22:43.670
and you look down on me
for lacking vision

22:43.737 --> 22:45.607
when I considered
this possibility

22:45.673 --> 22:48.178
-and turned it down.
-TAYO: It's just a trial, Hour.

22:48.245 --> 22:49.748
That's it. It's just a trial.

22:49.815 --> 22:51.753
-It's...
-We allow the AI

22:51.819 --> 22:53.321
to interpret the data.
If I'm wrong,

22:53.388 --> 22:56.496
then I'll pay the price,
but if I'm right, we all win.

22:56.562 --> 22:59.300
You have no idea
what the price will be.

22:59.367 --> 23:01.004
TAYO:
Well, gambling
with the status quo

23:01.071 --> 23:03.976
isn't much of a gamble now,
is it?

23:04.043 --> 23:07.651
HOUR:
The Bureau was led by
an authoritarian for 40 years.

23:09.053 --> 23:11.424
This system was about
making sure one decision-maker

23:11.492 --> 23:14.030
could never hold
that kind of power again.

23:28.493 --> 23:29.862
GABRIEL:
Your last scenario.

23:29.929 --> 23:31.933
Behind us is
the local movie theater.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.172
It's been taken over
by two men you've been pursuing.

23:35.239 --> 23:36.976
Wanted for murder and robbery,

23:37.043 --> 23:39.380
the suspects
are extremely dangerous.

23:39.447 --> 23:41.385
You've chased them
into this town.

23:41.451 --> 23:42.888
Their car is shot to pieces.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.459
They've fled on foot
into the theater where,

23:45.526 --> 23:46.996
in an act of desperation,

23:47.062 --> 23:49.367
they've taken
a matinee audience hostage.

23:49.434 --> 23:51.004
GABRIEL:
This was not their intention.

23:51.071 --> 23:52.608
This was not their plan.

23:52.675 --> 23:54.244
They're not terrorists.

23:54.310 --> 23:55.814
They're cornered animals.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.416
Volatile and unpredictable.

23:57.483 --> 24:00.188
DREW:
We don't know how many hostages
there are.

24:00.255 --> 24:01.726
We don't have eyes inside.

24:01.793 --> 24:04.931
And there are no historical
precedents to guide you.

24:04.998 --> 24:07.136
GABRIEL:
We will provide you
with a case file,

24:07.203 --> 24:11.311
biographies of the men
and the cinema's blueprints.

24:11.377 --> 24:13.315
Let me just add this.

24:13.381 --> 24:18.893
No class has ever succeeded
in rescuing all the hostages.

24:20.462 --> 24:22.333
Good luck.

24:23.068 --> 24:25.005
LENNIX:
Right, they're in
the main auditorium.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.609
There's no, uh...
there's no windows,

24:26.675 --> 24:28.345
no way to see in,
no sniper shot.

24:28.411 --> 24:29.882
We are totally blind.

24:29.949 --> 24:31.451
MURPHY:
Yeah, and if we storm
the theater,

24:31.518 --> 24:33.388
there's no way that
some hostages don't get killed.

24:33.455 --> 24:34.658
And that's not acceptable,
right?

24:34.725 --> 24:36.161
Yeah. So we need
to talk to them,

24:36.228 --> 24:37.865
we need to figure out
what they want.

24:37.931 --> 24:39.535
What they want is to escape.

24:39.602 --> 24:41.137
They-they've killed
a security guard

24:41.204 --> 24:42.975
and wounded police officers
and agents.

24:43.041 --> 24:44.310
They're looking
at a death sentence.

24:44.377 --> 24:45.714
They have nothing to lose.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.016
Yeah, we have nothing
to bargain with, either.

24:47.082 --> 24:48.886
Reading between the lines
on these men--

24:48.953 --> 24:51.291
they've known each other for
years, they met in the military,

24:51.358 --> 24:53.095
dishonorably discharged.

24:53.162 --> 24:55.933
Both left their wives to go
on a cross-country crime spree.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.807
They used proceeds
to buy booze and food.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.712
They slept out in the open,
leaving a trail of campfires.

25:01.779 --> 25:03.382
And what's your take on that?

25:03.449 --> 25:06.522
It's more like a road trip
than a criminal enterprise.

25:07.289 --> 25:08.793
Maybe they're lovers.

25:09.795 --> 25:11.833
TAYO:
So, how do we use that?

25:11.899 --> 25:14.539
Well, it influences
who we send in to talk to them.

25:14.605 --> 25:16.642
What about you?

25:16.708 --> 25:18.613
I think it should be a guy.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.115
I'll do it.

25:20.182 --> 25:21.652
You're a cop
from Salt Lake City.

25:21.719 --> 25:23.021
What's that supposed to mean?

25:23.087 --> 25:24.792
I don't care
what people do in the bedroom.

25:24.859 --> 25:26.862
-No. I know that.
-HOUR: They don't.

25:26.929 --> 25:28.198
LENNIX:
I don't care, either. I'll go.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.902
-I'll go.
-POET: No, you're-you're too...

25:29.969 --> 25:32.106
I'm too what? What am I "too"?

25:32.173 --> 25:33.909
Textbook FBI.

25:34.678 --> 25:35.947
Okay.

25:36.716 --> 25:38.285
Who goes in?

25:38.352 --> 25:39.955
They're outsiders.

25:40.022 --> 25:42.192
It should be someone
who's more of an outsider.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.633
TAYO:
Now, do you really think

25:45.700 --> 25:46.969
that the instructors
at Quantico--

25:47.036 --> 25:48.973
no offense to present company--

25:49.040 --> 25:50.777
have the bandwidth
to write a scenario

25:50.843 --> 25:52.346
that includes two gay guys?

25:52.413 --> 25:53.950
LENNIX:
Hoover kicked out all the gays.

25:54.017 --> 25:55.520
HOUR:
Except for his boyfriend.

25:55.587 --> 25:57.558
POET:
They haven't exactly
been welcome since.

25:57.624 --> 26:01.364
Hey, hey, no sudden movements,
and no fucking tricks,

26:01.430 --> 26:03.135
or everybody inside is dead.

26:03.202 --> 26:06.474
All right.
All I want to do is talk.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.879
Okay? No tricks.

26:08.946 --> 26:10.382
No lies.

26:10.449 --> 26:12.152
No guns.

26:20.335 --> 26:21.905
Okay.

26:33.796 --> 26:36.100
(door closes)

26:41.879 --> 26:43.482
He's injured.

26:43.550 --> 26:45.185
What, are you a doctor?

26:45.252 --> 26:46.622
No, I...

26:46.689 --> 26:49.661
But I can arrange for one
if you want.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.677
I'm dying.

26:57.744 --> 26:59.548
It's gonna be okay.
Listen to me.

26:59.615 --> 27:02.721
-(inhales sharply, groans)
-ROBBER 1: Hey, hey, if he dies,

27:02.788 --> 27:05.259
then everyone in this room dies,
I swear to God.

27:05.325 --> 27:07.798
So let me help him. We need
to get him to a hospital now.

27:07.865 --> 27:10.836
No. No, I want a car...

27:10.903 --> 27:13.342
for both of us,
and a route out of this town.

27:13.408 --> 27:16.114
And we're taking
three hostages with us.

27:16.181 --> 27:18.185
Okay,
even if I can arrange that,

27:18.252 --> 27:21.024
he's been shot in the stomach.
He's not gonna survive.

27:21.091 --> 27:23.394
We have ambulances on standby.

27:23.461 --> 27:25.365
Just let me make the call.

27:27.269 --> 27:28.606
I got you.

27:28.673 --> 27:30.475
Can I go with him?

27:30.543 --> 27:32.112
I don't want to die alone.

27:33.415 --> 27:34.684
I don't know, guys.

27:34.751 --> 27:36.220
We haven't heard from him
in a while.

27:36.287 --> 27:39.193
-He might be in trouble.
-We have to give him time.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.097
We do nothing?

27:41.164 --> 27:43.234
We do nothing.

27:44.571 --> 27:46.374
(exhales)

27:47.342 --> 27:49.748
I'm not gonna lie to you.

27:49.815 --> 27:51.785
You can save him, but...

27:51.852 --> 27:54.758
they're not gonna let you go.

27:54.824 --> 27:57.129
They're gonna separate you.

28:01.872 --> 28:03.543
Together to the end.

28:03.609 --> 28:05.980
That's what we always said.

28:06.749 --> 28:09.086
ROBBER 1:
To the end.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.340
WOMAN:
Please don't hurt us.

28:20.442 --> 28:23.415
Hey. Hey.

28:23.482 --> 28:26.254
I'm really sorry.

28:32.534 --> 28:34.738
End exercise.

28:38.746 --> 28:41.150
ROBBER 1:
Oh, man.

28:41.217 --> 28:42.954
The other trainees just come in

28:43.021 --> 28:44.992
firing their machine guns
and throwing flash grenades.

28:45.058 --> 28:48.231
We never get to do a love story.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.541
Congratulations.

28:52.608 --> 28:54.945
You're the first class
in the history of Quantico

28:55.011 --> 28:57.049
to rescue all the hostages.

28:57.116 --> 29:00.590
DREW:
You mastered the art
of doing nothing.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.226
When everything in your training

29:02.293 --> 29:04.965
told you to kick the door down,
you waited.

29:05.031 --> 29:07.604
We couldn't be happier
or more proud

29:07.670 --> 29:09.373
because the truth is,

29:09.440 --> 29:11.410
this isn't something
you can teach.

29:11.477 --> 29:13.749
Yeah, why not, sir?

29:13.816 --> 29:15.553
We tell every class

29:15.620 --> 29:18.057
that no one has ever saved
all the hostages,

29:18.124 --> 29:21.297
so they use more flash grenades
and more guns.

29:21.364 --> 29:24.538
We told you
they were cornered animals.

29:24.605 --> 29:26.742
You saw them as people.

29:26.809 --> 29:29.914
Congratulations.
Class dismissed.

29:34.958 --> 29:38.364
Poet, I can't do this anymore.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.905
Do what?

29:41.972 --> 29:44.009
This halfway house.

29:44.076 --> 29:47.049
We're either all in,
or we're not.

29:48.451 --> 29:50.488
I don't know
how to be a little bit in love.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.692
I don't know what that is.

29:51.759 --> 29:53.529
(Lennix sighs)

29:53.596 --> 29:56.301
We either do everything,
or-or we do nothing.

29:56.367 --> 29:59.675
And you don't want everything,
so...

29:59.741 --> 30:02.112
it has to be nothing.

30:02.847 --> 30:04.952
Okay.

30:05.019 --> 30:07.322
