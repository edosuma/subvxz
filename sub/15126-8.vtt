00:02.040 --> 00:04.399
A streetwalker, Sir, found ripped.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.359
This man once called me a friend.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.919
And then, amongst others,

00:10.920 --> 00:12.479
you killed his brother.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.999
Well, you know, he was never
one to hold a grudge.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.079
Stop!

00:16.079 --> 00:17.279
Who is it tells me?

00:17.280 --> 00:18.320
Police!

00:19.800 --> 00:22.279
If I decide to finish with that life?

00:22.280 --> 00:24.119
Then, you must be brave, Rose,

00:24.120 --> 00:25.640
and look for another.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.479
Always were a faker.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.360
This man's rooms, now!

00:37.320 --> 00:38.519
Another tart's been ripped

00:38.520 --> 00:41.240
and I've a snitch sends me to you!

00:42.920 --> 00:44.280
Take him!

00:47.560 --> 00:49.319
The boy was crippled,

00:49.320 --> 00:51.600
then put into the water to drown.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:11.080 --> 01:13.640
All right, shut up, you evil drunks.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.240
Shut it!

04:00.640 --> 04:01.760
Reid.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.319
Dr Bagster-Phillips done his work?
He has, Sir.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.079
Inspector Abberline was there.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.840
Your dead room was requisitioned for him.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.599
Another streetwalker, murdered, I shall say,

04:25.600 --> 04:28.239
at the hands of your Captain Jackson.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.320
And that is your surgeon's opinion?

04:31.760 --> 04:33.680
He goes to prepare his report.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.679
But is convinced, nonetheless,

04:37.680 --> 04:40.360
that she is Ripper.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.999
Throat-cut commencing left,
terminating right.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.439
Abrasions on the spine.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.759
Access to the pelvic organs
secured with one incision -

04:53.760 --> 04:56.319
ribcage to pubis.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.839
As before.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.720
Parts of the bladder taken and the womb also.

05:03.840 --> 05:08.919
That organ recovered at Captain
Jackson's lodgings on Tenter Street.

05:08.920 --> 05:12.399
And what is it led you to search there?

05:12.400 --> 05:15.720
The same communication which reported
this poor creature's whereabouts?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.719
It is sufficient, Inspector,

05:19.720 --> 05:23.679
to draw this case to a close and name him.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.039
Do you think, Fred,

05:25.040 --> 05:28.879
that hanging my American
will return your sleep to you?

05:28.880 --> 05:31.599
Obsessions are addictions.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.919
Which may not be defeated by actions
in the physical world,

05:34.920 --> 05:37.920
but by a change of temper in the mind.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.519
Come on, Reid, we both know what gives here.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.359
Fred Abberline is...

05:45.360 --> 05:47.879
He's fixated, I grant you. But he's honest.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.759
Led to your innocence, he'll have you freed.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.159
And it's you that pilots him
there, is it? I hope to!

05:53.160 --> 05:55.159
No. You really want to stop this?

05:55.160 --> 05:57.599
You want to save my neck
from a stretching? Of course I do.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.479
Then, you return to me my pistol,
you forget those keys of yours.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.759
And you take a walk.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.719
And have this fantasy given extra credence?

06:03.720 --> 06:06.359
Have vigilante patrols scouring the streets

06:06.360 --> 06:08.759
looking for your head to break? No.

06:08.760 --> 06:13.400
No. You, bide your time
and you trust in me.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.999
Sergeant Artherton,
do you recall the cigarette seller?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.159
Joseph Lawende.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.399
Er... witness at the Eddowes inquiry?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.879
Saw who ever she was with that night.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.479
Goes by the name of Lavender now, Sir.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.720
Have him rousted and brought to me. Sir.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.799
Come in.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.999
Er... Rose, you have a visitor.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.039
'I never expected to find you here,
in Mrs Reid's shelter.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.359
'When we are now'

06:52.360 --> 06:54.399
quite recovered at Tenter Street.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.799
Our gentlemen help us back to our feet.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.120
All is as ever was.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.759
Except, of course, the continued
absence of Captain Jackson,

07:03.760 --> 07:06.320
beneath the key of Mrs Reid here's husband.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.919
And what will become of him, Miss Susan?

07:10.920 --> 07:13.320
Mr Abberline makes his case.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.479
They will call him Ripper.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.680
And hang him.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.719
Which is why I would have
you back with me, Rose.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.679
A room of your very own.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.119
A key with which you can
come and go as you please.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.599
Rose, you are not imprisoned here.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.519
I know, Mrs Reid.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.759
But, Miss Hart, I cannot permit you to come here

07:32.760 --> 07:34.239
if you do so to procure.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.159
Rose, this woman would make
a penniless drudge of you.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.999
I would not.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.559
I give her a home,

07:40.560 --> 07:43.519
somewhere from which she may choose
what to make of herself.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.560
Rose?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.240
Is it your wish that you remain here
a while longer yet?

07:49.440 --> 07:52.159
It is, Mrs Reid.

07:52.160 --> 07:56.240
Miss Susan, you took me from
the streets and gave me a home.

07:58.200 --> 08:03.439
But I am set now on improving
my circumstances further still.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.319
And how will you do that, girl?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.720
I would not hex myself by saying yet.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.160
But I do hope to tell you all, very soon.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.759
Mr Lavender, I'm most grateful for your visit.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.558
Am I to believe there was choice in the matter?

08:36.559 --> 08:38.880
What does that man do here!?

08:40.559 --> 08:41.759
He helps us.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.079
And may confirm your
convictions, Chief Inspector,

08:45.080 --> 08:47.159
that Jackson is Ripper.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.279
Your office, now!

08:50.280 --> 08:53.519
Do you not consider witness
identification a key constituent?

08:53.520 --> 08:57.079
That man, an eccentric at best, a loon at worst,

08:57.080 --> 08:59.679
had full clap of the man with Catherine Eddowes

08:59.680 --> 09:01.959
and still could not describe him to us!

09:01.960 --> 09:03.959
But now, we have something
that we lacked then -

09:03.960 --> 09:06.639
we have a suspect in custody
for him to make comparison.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.040
Or are you afraid of what he might say?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.640
Follow us, Mr Lavender.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.439
Mr Lavender, it is a year since, I know.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.200
But there is a man beyond we wish you to study.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.440
Please, Sir. Step forward.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.600
Closer.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.040
Look at him!

09:41.960 --> 09:43.599
Well?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.119
No, I cannot say.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.880
It is what I have tried to tell you.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.040
Yes, that night...

09:55.760 --> 09:57.120
..I saw him.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.599
But I saw nothing in him!

10:01.600 --> 10:03.760
Where his face should be...

10:05.160 --> 10:06.480
..only darkness.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.319
It's The Ripper.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.439
He is dybbuk.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.079
You chase him...

10:18.360 --> 10:19.679
..you are fools.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.079
Whatever peace you have known,

10:22.080 --> 10:23.919
you will know it no longer.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.360
Only calamity...

10:27.320 --> 10:28.960
..and turmoil.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.639
Evil on your shoulder.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.920
This all does nothing, Edmund.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.599
Come on.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.239
Your Ripper is not for finding.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.160
Only for hunting!

10:47.360 --> 10:48.800
Well, that went well.

10:58.720 --> 10:59.920
Thank you.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.199
Hobbs' wife.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.000
Come to collect his personals.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.680
Hobbs was married!?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.320
I had no... I had no idea.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.160
No, Sir.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.159
Sergeant.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.239
I'd hear your thoughts on what we
might next do for Captain Jackson?

11:31.240 --> 11:33.719
I was set on an afternoon in The Bear, Sir.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.000
I am owed time, as you know.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.640
Sergeant Drake!

11:52.440 --> 11:53.879
You explain yourself.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.559
If you work to free Captain Jackson,

11:56.560 --> 11:59.839
or whatever name it is we
should now call him by,

11:59.840 --> 12:03.399
I'm sorry, but you must do so alone.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.879
You honestly think him guilty
of this woman's killing?

12:05.880 --> 12:07.839
The others also?
That we at last have our man?

12:07.840 --> 12:09.599
Mr Reid, I care not.

12:09.600 --> 12:14.119
All I know is, the man who made
that woman widow, Frank Goodnight,

12:14.120 --> 12:17.199
he came to this town in search of our American.

12:17.200 --> 12:21.199
Your association with Captain Jackson...

12:21.200 --> 12:23.039
it has done us little but ill,

12:23.040 --> 12:24.359
in my humble opinion.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.999
Look at these last months, Bennet. We've
done some good with his help, have we not?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.439
You tell that to Dick Hobbs.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.320
See if you can rouse agreement from him.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.119
Miss Erskin.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.239
I am sorry if I am late, Mr Trumper.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.879
I, I missed my omnibus
at Bethnal Green and had to wait...

12:56.880 --> 13:00.039
Not at all, it's wonderful to see you again.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.120
You did have me worried, however...

13:04.240 --> 13:07.479
..that you might have changed
your mind. No, Sir.

13:07.480 --> 13:12.319
I, I've been greatly looking forward
to meeting with you once more.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.599
Shall we take a walk?

13:14.600 --> 13:17.639
'When I saw the Estancia for the first time, '

13:17.640 --> 13:22.119
two day's ride from Buenos Aries,
it is magnificent.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.559
It's 50,000 acres, 70,000 head of cattle.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.439
But there have been sacrifices.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.880
Ten hard years of labour and...

13:31.760 --> 13:32.800
Well...

13:34.840 --> 13:38.919
..I am a man who wishes for a family.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.439
For a wife.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.359
I would find that wife here
rather than in the Argentine.

13:43.360 --> 13:47.319
To think that we were introduced
through the pages of a newspaper...

13:47.320 --> 13:50.959
Well, it is a wonder.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.639
Miss Erskine.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.999
Without wishing to seem over-forward,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.160
but do you imagine that
such a life might suit you?

14:00.320 --> 14:01.960
Mr Trumper, I...

14:03.400 --> 14:08.120
..I know nothing of the world except
for this patch of sky right here.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.399
But I would change that.

14:11.400 --> 14:16.520
Do you think that you might
begin to call me... Victor?

14:18.720 --> 14:20.119
I'm Rose.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.400
Rose.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.679
As we agreed, I've brought us a picnic.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.400
Miss Rose? Are you unwell?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.040
I feel I, I might...

14:53.160 --> 14:55.359
Please! Someone?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.400
Call a carriage!

14:57.600 --> 14:58.640
Can you hear me?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.320
Cheers, Neville.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.399
This one?

15:35.400 --> 15:38.039
He, er... he threw his neighbour's son

15:38.040 --> 15:41.479
off the roof of Christ Church Spitalfield.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.200
The company I keep these days, Reid.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.960
Sergeant Drake.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.839
Miss Susan.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.639
Rose is no longer with us.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.079
Have you not heard?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.960
I heard all right. I er...

16:09.160 --> 16:11.200
It is the reason I come.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.319
Is it true, Sergeant, you were sweet on Rose?

16:19.320 --> 16:20.960
But that she let you down?

16:24.280 --> 16:27.639
That makes her a fool

16:27.640 --> 16:28.999
and more besides.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.759
There's not a girl here

16:30.760 --> 16:32.680
who doesn't think you are the finest of men.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.559
Miss Bella...

16:46.560 --> 16:47.759
Sergeant?

16:47.760 --> 16:49.799
..would you keep a secret for me?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.599
Till my death.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.879
If we just sat here for a while,

16:54.880 --> 16:57.760
in this chair, you and I.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.800
And perhaps I might sleep for a moment or so.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.280
If we did that...

17:07.480 --> 17:09.960
..would you tell no-one what passed?

17:11.440 --> 17:15.079
I er... I do not ask you to lie,

17:15.079 --> 17:18.400
simply to say nothing if questioned.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.319
House broken up on Truman.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.239
Street theft, Commercial Street.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.039
Street theft, Aldgate Corner.

17:52.040 --> 17:55.079
Three counts of public
indecency down at Petticoat.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.439
Two men cutlassed at closing time
at the Shipwrights. One now dead.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.919
Two missing persons, both teenage girls.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.279
One on Sidney, the other, Cheshire.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.919
Are you finished, Artherton?

18:04.920 --> 18:07.359
That is today's roll, Sir. Yes.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.639
Mrs Reid?

18:08.640 --> 18:10.319
Morning, Madam.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.840
Come in, Emily.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.279
It is the third night this week
you've slept in that cot.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.399
Is it more comfortable than it looks? No.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.879
No, I er... I'm tired, Emily.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.480
I'd fall asleep on pins.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.440
I come because...

18:36.960 --> 18:39.080
..I confess myself disturbed.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.279
Rose. The girl I took in from Miss Hart's.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.479
What of her?

18:45.480 --> 18:47.120
She did not return last night.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.560
Edmund, I thought her sincere.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.440
What do you suppose might happen,
Bennet, if we sat here all day?

19:26.280 --> 19:27.839
We'd be drunk, Mr Reid.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.040
Whisky.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.839
Your Rose...

19:39.840 --> 19:41.399
She's not my Rose.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.000
She's not mine...

19:45.360 --> 19:46.600
..as you well know.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.759
According to Mrs Reid, Rose did not
return to the shelter last night.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.879
Then, she returns to type.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.119
That was my response also until Mrs Reid told me

19:56.120 --> 19:57.719
the shelter had been broke into.

19:57.720 --> 20:00.080
Nothing taken but the girl's personals.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.200
What use our work, Bennet...

20:08.720 --> 20:10.720
..if we cannot care for those we love?

20:21.440 --> 20:24.119
You said the wastepaper
had been cleared? -Huh.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.599
You noticed it full.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.879
The newspapers, writing paper.
It struck me as strange.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.559
What? That she could read and write?

20:31.560 --> 20:32.799
I suppose so, yes.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.199
The Ragged School, on Field Lane.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.480
She went there every day till she was 16.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.759
Did you see what she read and wrote here?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.119
Er... letters, many of them.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.080
Received and sent. Letters?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.680
Will you fetch me paper? -Huh.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.639
Did she speak also of a wide
network of friends and family

20:57.640 --> 20:59.439
with whom she would correspond?

20:59.440 --> 21:01.439
She has none, Sir.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.560
Thank you.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.919
You see these?

21:13.920 --> 21:16.120
Circles. Many circles.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.319
These letters, Emily, do you think it possible

21:21.320 --> 21:24.639
she might have ran and responded
to adverts in the Lonely Hearts?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.920
It is possible, yes.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.039
Sergeant, we are going back to work.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.200
Does that suit you?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.640
Yes, Mr Reid, it does.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.559
Artherton. Read me that roll again.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.839
Yes, Sir. Er, house broken up
on Truman Street. Yes.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.839
Street theft, Commercial Street. Yes, yes.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.679
Three counts of public indecency. Yes.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.119
Two men cutlassed at closing. Move on!

21:49.120 --> 21:51.599
And two missing persons, both teenage girls.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.839
What ages, precisely? 17 and 19, Sir.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.799
One on Sidney Street, one on Cheshire? Sir.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.199
No tarts or destitutes, then?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.479
No, both house maids.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.479
Reported last night, but missing since when?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.559
One on 19th, the other the 22nd.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.759
Get men to their addresses. All their
personal effects returned here.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.519
Yes, Mr Reid. Johnson! Michaels!

22:07.520 --> 22:09.840
With me, Sergeant. We return to our past.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.719
All our Ripper suspects, Sir?

22:12.720 --> 22:15.159
High earners, very,

22:15.160 --> 22:17.560
I look for one in particular.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.680
Here.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.000
Here!

22:30.040 --> 22:31.879
What?

22:31.880 --> 22:33.519
Are you so desperate, Inspector,

22:33.520 --> 22:36.719
that you rake through
all the suspects we ever knew?

22:36.720 --> 22:39.400
We have the man, in your cell.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.160
Those two missing girls' particulars, Sir.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.640
They were using the Lonely Hearts and all.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.759
You see, the favoured here are highlighted?

22:53.760 --> 22:56.919
Which is why I look for this man.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.039
Victor Silver.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.439
Cattleman.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.679
Land in the Argentine.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.879
Slaughters his beef there.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.639
Refrigerates it to board his reefer ship.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.399
Ships it for sale - New York,
the Continent, London.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.119
And once he got here,

23:13.120 --> 23:14.719
the way he liked to operate -

23:14.720 --> 23:16.159
he placed these personals,

23:16.160 --> 23:19.079
like the ones used by our missing girls.

23:19.080 --> 23:23.239
He responded to them also, met these
girls, charmed them, drugged them

23:23.240 --> 23:25.479
took them off the streets. Why?

23:25.480 --> 23:28.319
We never knew. The only way he came
to eye is one of them caught him

23:28.320 --> 23:31.519
slipping a dose of narcotics into her drink.

23:31.520 --> 23:34.159
They fought, he produced a knife.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.639
A long one, very sharp.

23:36.640 --> 23:40.199
It failed to stop her from kicking
his bollocks in and running to us.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.439
But, for a week or two, we fancied
him for Ripper. Do you remember?

23:43.440 --> 23:46.839
And then, we ruled him out.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.919
For good reasons.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.959
Ones which I am surprised you have forgot.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.519
Sergeant, read from the file.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.559
The up-front summation will suffice.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.959
Victor Silver, cattle importer.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.960
Deceased 15th of Sep...

24:04.280 --> 24:07.359
Deceased 15th of September 1888.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.559
A year ago.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.959
Read on.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.679
The details of his death.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.599
Drowned aboard the steam launch,
The Pride Of Wapping.

24:14.600 --> 24:18.079
Drowned aboard the steam launch,
The Pride Of Wapping...

24:18.080 --> 24:19.839
No.

24:19.840 --> 24:20.880
Missing.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.640
No body found or washed up.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.199
77 drowned. Five lost.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.880
171 saved. Myself included.

24:37.960 --> 24:41.079
This man, Silver. Mr Reid? It is
the first time I've heard his name.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.399
There were many names mentioned last year.
Hardly surprising to forget a few.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.719
Yes, Sir. But tell me if I overstep.
The Pride Of Wapping?

24:47.720 --> 24:50.039
Was that not the launch
from which your daughter...?

24:50.040 --> 24:51.520
Sergeant. You overstep.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.959
Dear Miss Erskine,

25:10.960 --> 25:13.719
I am Clara, Victor's sister.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.239
You took ill, so he brought you to our home.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.879
It is morning.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.639
I was worried you might never wake.

25:20.640 --> 25:24.479
I cannot remember when I ever slept so sound.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.639
Is there somewhere you need to be?

25:27.640 --> 25:31.759
If there is, I... I cannot remember.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.559
Then, please. I have laid out some clothes.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.080
When you are ready, join us for breakfast.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.280
Dear Rose. Please.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.280
This is my other brother, Barnaby.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.640
And our young friend, Mary.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.480
You are very pretty, Miss.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.120
Please come.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.399
Barnaby?

26:22.400 --> 26:24.040
Excuse me, Miss Rose.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.079
Rose.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.679
It was my greatest hope to find you still here.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.759
I have been made most welcome.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.479
I am blessed with my family.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.079
Do you not agree?

26:40.080 --> 26:42.000
Barnaby, see to the bell.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.239
It is the most common of plagues, Mr Reid.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.239
Loneliness.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.839
It is the city's curse.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.159
But this, our Lonely Hearts, the remedy.

26:59.160 --> 27:02.559
Now, you may dictate
the details of your desired love.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.239
Our team of editors,

27:04.240 --> 27:08.319
their one aim to lead you toward
the happiness that all men merit,

27:08.320 --> 27:12.159
they will transcribe, print and
forward the missives of your passion

27:12.160 --> 27:15.719
for the smallest of prices
and in total anonymity.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.679
But were we to construct and place our own,

27:17.680 --> 27:19.319
you would print and run it for us?

27:19.320 --> 27:23.359
So you do seek a wife for your Sergeant.

27:23.360 --> 27:26.800
Your head is a sight to behold, scribbler.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.519
You want me to match this side with the other?

27:31.520 --> 27:32.999
Mr Drake, come now.

27:34.760 --> 27:38.240
You know me. Ever obliging.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.079
But I would know

27:42.080 --> 27:44.799
what reward we, here at The Star,

27:44.800 --> 27:46.999
might expect for such a service.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.239
Perhaps...

27:49.240 --> 27:52.239
an interview with your gunslinger Ripper?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.239
What price these personal advertisements?

27:54.240 --> 27:57.159
Ten pence. Then that is your reward,
Mr Best.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.799
'As you compose your messages, '

28:00.800 --> 28:02.959
remember this,

28:02.960 --> 28:04.799
he will want you naive, young,

28:04.800 --> 28:06.559
lonely and lost in this world.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.919
You may dictate your messages to these men here.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.279
And when you do, you speak from the heart.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.279
It is our Rose for whom we do so.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.039
I am a gentle girl, shy at first,

28:16.040 --> 28:19.400
but eager to demonstrate...

28:29.640 --> 28:30.680
Rose?

28:34.440 --> 28:37.120
Are there those that miss and wonder after you?

28:39.960 --> 28:41.080
No, Victor.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.680
Not a soul?

28:48.240 --> 28:52.160
It makes me weep to think of you so alone.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.639
I do not feel so in your home, however.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.720
I feel as happy here as I ever have.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.240
A rose, for a Rose.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.919
You need not be so gallant.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.400
Not with me.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.600
Do I offend, Sir?

29:35.360 --> 29:36.960
It's quite all right, Rose.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.280
Here...

29:41.400 --> 29:42.760
Some more cordial?

29:46.360 --> 29:47.720
No, I...

29:48.840 --> 29:50.200
..I don't think I will.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.360
Perhaps it's time I took my leave of you.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.920
No, Rose. We grow far too fond of you here.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.679
Do we not, Brother?

30:04.680 --> 30:06.239
We do, Victor.

30:07.520 --> 30:08.999
Have Clara calm her.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.279
Let me go!

30:10.280 --> 30:13.039
Put me down, let me go!

30:14.400 --> 30:17.119
There is violence in that one, Victor.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.639
She has worth, however.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.199
Not if she scratch the eyes
from the man to whom she is sold.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.399
Sweet sister. You shall look after her.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.839
And when seven weeks at sea have passed,

30:27.840 --> 30:30.399
well, she'll be grateful merely to be alive.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.959
Clara.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.639
Hold firm.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.519
We have but one more package yet to collect.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.879
And then, we can set to sea,

30:38.880 --> 30:42.599
safe in the knowledge that we need
not return until the new century.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.480
Should we wish to return at all?

30:47.240 --> 30:49.719
Now go. You've left the child alone

30:49.720 --> 30:53.319
and, though we need no
longer bind her to her bed,

30:53.320 --> 30:55.680
she may still run from us,
given the opportunity.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.919
You're to see all of these printed
in the morning run.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.439
And take receipt of all
marked applicants yourself.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.360
You... You heard me, scribbler!

31:43.440 --> 31:44.800
What is it?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.520
The accident I told you of.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.960
My daughter.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.160
There was a man aboard that boat.

32:04.560 --> 32:09.560
A man whose remains were also never recovered...

32:11.040 --> 32:13.319
..but all thought him dead.

32:13.320 --> 32:16.200
This man, I...

32:17.440 --> 32:18.760
..I believe him returned.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.040
And if he indeed survived, then...

32:25.720 --> 32:30.160
..so also you think perhaps your daughter.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.080
I have always known it.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.159
I have known she was out there, somewhere.

32:39.160 --> 32:43.520
But this, this secret dream
that now takes life...

32:44.840 --> 32:47.480
It is not for you to share with me.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.919
Your daughter had a mother.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.399
A mother who would have me
call her dead and gone...

32:57.400 --> 33:00.399
No, Edmund, no!

33:00.400 --> 33:04.840
I cannot be the sounding board for your guilt.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.080
You seek forgiveness?

33:11.640 --> 33:13.359
An ally in the hope that your life

33:13.360 --> 33:16.160
might return to what it once was?

33:17.440 --> 33:20.120
I cannot provide these things for you.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.079
Please.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.600
You should go home.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.640
Have you been here all night?

33:41.960 --> 33:44.800
Please sit down, Emily, I would speak with you.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.600
One of the five unrecovered
from the steam cruiser that day.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.799
A man.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.240
Name of Silver.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.679
I believe he still breathes.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.279
Mathilda.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.080
She was with him.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.599
How?!

34:16.600 --> 34:20.040
Because... she was with me.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.760
And I was at work.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.360
He was a candidate of mine.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.559
For Ripper.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.239
I had men put on his lodgings

34:33.239 --> 34:36.039
with orders to alert me, should he leave.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.518
I came home...

34:37.520 --> 34:39.719
For the first time in, in ten days.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.199
You had asked me to.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.319
So that you might go visiting in Harrow.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.518
So that I may have an hour or two for myself!

34:46.520 --> 34:49.559
If... if you even begin
to lay this at my door,

34:49.560 --> 34:52.639
I will leave this moment
and you will never see me more.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.560
Word came.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.519
He was moving south.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.680
And so, you decided to take her with you.

35:03.400 --> 35:08.279
To have our daughter by your side
as you stalked this man.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.759
Should I have left her here?

35:09.760 --> 35:12.560
Yes, Edmund! You should have!

35:20.320 --> 35:22.560
You say she was with him.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.880
We picked him up on Petticoat Lane.

35:29.320 --> 35:32.199
She held my hand as we walked south.

35:32.200 --> 35:35.639
For the docks, at St Catherine's.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.920
Do you remember how she loved the boats?

35:39.400 --> 35:41.479
We bought tickets.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.039
The launch sailed.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.959
Mathilda joined a gaggle of young

35:44.960 --> 35:47.360
running back and forth on the upper deck.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.559
Which is where I found him.

35:50.560 --> 35:54.280
He had met a girl, Veronica Atkins.

35:55.800 --> 35:59.040
Her drowned body recovered
one week later, at Greenwich.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.839
He had bought her lemonade.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.799
Which I feared he would drug.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.359
I stepped forward, he saw me.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.680
Knew me for what I was.

36:13.640 --> 36:16.359
At which moment it all came to pass.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.359
The ship struck.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.359
The hull split.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.719
The deck lurching into the air.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.120
The gaggle of girls, slipping across it.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.560
Mathilda calling for me as she fell.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.679
All was aflame.

36:33.680 --> 36:36.400
The steam pipe came down upon me.
I could not move.

36:38.800 --> 36:43.879
Could not reach her as she fell past
this man, into the water beneath him.

36:43.880 --> 36:48.800
Where he, unable to cling on,
also fell an instant later.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.520
Do you see, Emily?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.640
He might be able to say.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.720
To recall...

36:59.040 --> 37:03.119
..that no, she sank like a rock
to the floor of the Thames.

37:03.120 --> 37:08.479
Or that yes, she clung to driftwood.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.319
Or even to he, himself.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.840
Stop. Stop.

37:13.080 --> 37:16.000
You raise a hope that sinks its claws into me.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.840
If it is forlorn...

37:22.800 --> 37:25.920
..Edmund, I dare not think
what will become of us.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.919
Florence, authoress and composer of music.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.679
32, wishes to meet with a true gentleman.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.040
Too old.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.919
Help!

37:46.920 --> 37:48.640
Help!

38:04.200 --> 38:05.280
Eat up.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.319
Help!

38:13.320 --> 38:18.359
'Help! Help me! Help!

38:18.360 --> 38:20.399
'Help!'

38:20.400 --> 38:21.479
Help!

38:30.760 --> 38:35.080
Don't move, sit here, don't move.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.920
Madison!

39:13.360 --> 39:15.159
Send to Inspector Reid.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.679
Tell him there's a lonely-heart
cattleman here.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.999
Name of Trumper.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.440
Victor Trumper.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.399
You. Name?

39:24.400 --> 39:25.720
Bella.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.199
I cannot watch from close.

39:31.200 --> 39:35.359
This man, if it is he,
he has had sight of me before.

39:35.360 --> 39:39.080
The Sergeant here will never be
far. We have a carriage outside.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.039
For caution, Bella.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.960
I am very proud of you.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.759
Miss Culver?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.640
Mr... Trumper?

40:31.120 --> 40:33.239
Well, I am sure all who see you say the same,

40:33.240 --> 40:37.480
that you are, forgive me, a beautiful woman.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.639
Miss? Bella.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.280
I cannot see him clear enough.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.120
Would you call me Victor?

40:49.840 --> 40:51.320
Shall we stroll a little?

40:53.040 --> 40:54.440
I should like that.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.079
Riggs and Michaels track along the
ridge above. Drake in their steps.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.159
None closer than 50 yard. I shall cut left.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.880
See if I can get closer. Go, go.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.240
I took the liberty.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.800
Please.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.360
It's lemonade.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.440
Made by my sister.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.719
Where was it you lived,
before you came to this city?

41:59.720 --> 42:01.319
Southend, Sir.

42:01.320 --> 42:04.679
Please, call me Victor.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.280
Do drink some more of your lemonade...

42:09.120 --> 42:11.199
We should walk a little more.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.999
No, Sir. I'm happy here.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.119
No, you shall call me Victor.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.920
And we shall walk.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.519
You!

42:23.520 --> 42:26.319
Whoever you are, you stop right there!

42:26.320 --> 42:28.999
You. It is you.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.480
If I see any of you move, she's dead.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.280
Sergeant Drake!

42:44.560 --> 42:45.880
No!

42:56.880 --> 42:58.199
Damn you, Silver.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.279
Damn you, you stay alive. You stay alive!

43:00.280 --> 43:02.240
Give it to me, you're all right.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.599
Yes. You remember me?

43:07.600 --> 43:10.759
You remember me,
you remember my little girl, Silver?

43:10.760 --> 43:13.359
You remember her also?

43:13.360 --> 43:16.559
Tell me! Did she live? Do you have her?

43:16.560 --> 43:19.160
Did you see her, do you have her?

43:22.040 --> 43:23.599
No!

43:23.600 --> 43:25.279
No! No! No!

43:25.280 --> 43:27.359
No! No! No!

43:27.360 --> 43:30.039
He's the only one,
he's the only one, you understand?

43:30.040 --> 43:32.639
He's the only one who could
say, whether she lives!

43:32.640 --> 43:34.079
His sister.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.040
He spoke of his sister.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.119
'Jackson!'

43:40.120 --> 43:41.719
Are you still on my ticket?

43:41.720 --> 43:43.319
Yes, I am.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.760
Then, I need you now by my side.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.599
I need to know where he's
been the last 48 hours.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.800
You can help me.

43:53.840 --> 43:56.159
He has Miss Rose under key somewhere.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.720
Others also.

43:59.320 --> 44:00.599
This was about him.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.839
You expect me to work like this?
Yes, I do for now. Yes!

44:02.840 --> 44:05.120
Well, then get him stripped, goddamit!

44:08.160 --> 44:10.559
These in his coat, they are customs dockets

44:10.560 --> 44:15.039
for cargo transit aboard a ship -
the Clara May.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.959
Eight separate items. Large ones too.

44:17.960 --> 44:20.639
She sails in a day.
There's matter in his lungs.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.399
What is it?

44:22.400 --> 44:24.119
I can't say yet.

44:24.120 --> 44:27.479
I need to remove the tissue, set
it in wax and make a cross-section.

44:27.480 --> 44:29.039
Then I can tell you.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.400
What's this? Smell.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.839
I have to cook it. Cook it?

44:37.840 --> 44:41.080
Yes! Cook it!
Get some scissors and cut a patch.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.519
And?!

44:59.520 --> 45:00.920
Patience, Reid.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.760
It's just a matter of minutes.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.839
So, is this her?

45:07.840 --> 45:11.480
This the woman I am supposed to have
slaughtered? What if she is?

45:24.840 --> 45:28.199
If I could see a way of clearing myself of this,

45:28.200 --> 45:29.879
would you grant it to me?

45:29.880 --> 45:33.599
Not if it involve you leaving
this room, Captain. It does not.

45:33.600 --> 45:36.280
Just tell me you ain't burned Frank Goodnight.

45:41.880 --> 45:44.359
One dead Pinkerton.

45:44.360 --> 45:48.600
Any man stands in my way shall
find my foot on his throat!

45:51.960 --> 45:53.239
The three of you.

45:53.240 --> 45:55.799
I'll see you on the rope with him.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.080
Enough!

46:04.520 --> 46:08.320
This man is Homer Jackson, he is my surgeon!

46:10.320 --> 46:13.680
I man I trust to show me
to the truth, as I have always done.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.760
Now, make your case, Captain.

46:19.080 --> 46:21.519
Do you see any stripes here?

46:21.520 --> 46:23.319
Blood drawn?

46:23.320 --> 46:24.560
No.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.879
This woman, dead five days. Yes?

46:27.880 --> 46:29.279
Yes.

46:29.280 --> 46:32.200
You see here, these two finger nails broken.

46:37.480 --> 46:39.399
Skin, from her assailant.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.119
Now, Inspector you will confirm

46:41.120 --> 46:43.600
that I have not yet opened
this sack. I will.

46:44.960 --> 46:48.879
Frank Goodnight, the man
that I shot dead out there.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.040
A man with a long history of malice
held in my direction.

46:55.720 --> 46:56.879
What do you see?

46:56.880 --> 46:58.999
Scratches. Four of them.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.919
The two middle deepest.
Corresponding with the broken nails.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.519
Right hand to left side of neck.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.879
Circumstance. Chance.
I have not yet finished.

47:05.880 --> 47:08.359
Sergeant Drake, describe me.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.800
An adjective or two.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.199
American. So you keep saying.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.599
Feckless. Come on! Describe my appearance.

47:15.600 --> 47:16.999
Unwashed. Scraggly.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.879
Thank you! Frank Goodnight here was not.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.200
You can smell the hair-oil on him still.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.519
Macassar.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.480
It was wound about her fingers.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.960
Smell it.

47:33.280 --> 47:35.239
Strike you as familiar at all?

47:35.240 --> 47:40.519
If you wish to pursue your current
course of action, you be my guest.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.599
You and I will be pitched apart, Fred.

47:43.600 --> 47:47.759
The press will celebrate it,
your name blackened, or mine.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.479
But the same truth still abides.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.720
This man is not the man you seek.

47:53.320 --> 47:54.360
Now...

47:55.520 --> 47:57.600
..will you let us get about our duty?

48:06.240 --> 48:07.400
Well?

48:12.240 --> 48:13.799
It's organic.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.039
Lignified.

48:15.040 --> 48:19.119
Could be sawdust or wood shavings.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.360
In his lungs!

48:22.720 --> 48:23.999
Heavily calloused.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.439
What's he been building?

48:25.440 --> 48:27.080
The patch from his trousers.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.119
Ammonia.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.679
The refrigeration wadding
on his ship? Is he stripping it?

48:34.680 --> 48:36.639
To make his hold more inhabitable?

48:36.640 --> 48:39.399
Sir, the customs dockets.
Eight different units.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.199
He's constructing his own sea-cans.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.279
Each one large enough to hold a grown woman

48:43.280 --> 48:45.279
while he traffics her across to South America.

48:45.280 --> 48:47.239
But it's seven weeks to the Argentine.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.959
Captain, the medicine with which
he doped that girl? Laudanum.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.599
Cut with passion flower tincture.
Keeps you calm and happy

48:52.600 --> 48:54.879
no matter the circumstance.
So you'd need a lot.

48:54.880 --> 48:57.439
More than you'd collect
from your neighbourhood druggist.

48:57.440 --> 48:59.359
Sergeant, find out where his ship is at dock.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.440
Get a list of all the pharmaceutical
wholesalers within two miles of it.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.359
Number 64!

49:11.360 --> 49:12.400
Here!

49:18.360 --> 49:21.920
Miss Silver! If that is your name.
We have your brother.

49:23.640 --> 49:26.200
Which? Victor? There is another?

49:37.800 --> 49:40.359
She must know where these girls are kept.

49:40.360 --> 49:44.079
Reid, there's a strategy
that I'd like to put to you.

49:44.080 --> 49:46.640
It's going to require Drake, here.

49:47.640 --> 49:48.680
Go on.

49:57.040 --> 49:59.000
I would see Victor. Would you?

50:02.040 --> 50:04.720
While he is otherwise occupied, Miss Silver.

50:06.520 --> 50:08.559
My company will have to do. Now.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.039
This is what I know.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.439
You, your brothers...

50:12.440 --> 50:15.039
turn young women's loneliness
to your own account.

50:15.040 --> 50:17.840
You draw them in. Seduce. Drug.

50:19.200 --> 50:22.760
House them in cargo cans
for their shipping to South America.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.400
And...

50:26.880 --> 50:30.959
Well, there my knowledge finds its limit.

50:30.960 --> 50:33.759
There is much lies beyond
those limits, Inspector.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.159
For one thing,

50:35.160 --> 50:40.679
where it is you imprison your cargo
before its journey?

50:40.680 --> 50:43.799
For another, who it is
keeps watch on them there?

50:43.800 --> 50:45.759
Your other brother.

50:45.760 --> 50:46.880
He indeed.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.559
Barnaby.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.479
If Victor and I are not returned home,

50:51.480 --> 50:53.279
alone and unharmed by nightfall,

50:53.280 --> 50:55.079
he will not falter.

50:55.080 --> 50:57.279
He will kill them all and not think twice.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.480
I, er...

51:00.120 --> 51:01.720
I would avoid that.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.839
As would I.

51:04.840 --> 51:07.079
Then, best you tell me
where it is he keeps them.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.359
What did Victor say when you asked him this?

51:09.360 --> 51:11.159
He remained silent.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.720
Then, so shall I.

51:14.880 --> 51:16.439
The child killer!

51:16.440 --> 51:17.880
Get him stripped.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.239
What the hell are you doing?

51:22.240 --> 51:24.839
Creole trapper showed me how.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.360
Never attempted it myself though.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.799
May I ask how it was you found us?

51:31.800 --> 51:33.839
You have a girl known to us.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.079
We looked for her.

51:35.080 --> 51:36.119
Which girl?

51:36.120 --> 51:38.239
You tell me the ones you have taken,

51:38.240 --> 51:40.959
I shall let you know when you land upon her.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.279
And if you are mistaken and she is not with us?

51:44.280 --> 51:47.519
Our search will continue and you
and your brothers will still swing.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.759
And the lives Barnaby will take.

51:49.760 --> 51:52.279
Those innocent dead,

51:52.280 --> 51:54.039
will they haunt you?

51:54.040 --> 51:55.480
My life here.

51:56.760 --> 51:59.319
The dead are something to which
I have grown accustomed.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.239
Innocent or blameworthy.

52:01.240 --> 52:05.240
And yet, you believe one of ours known to you.

52:06.840 --> 52:08.720
Perhaps I will list them for you.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.759
Three serving maids,

52:11.760 --> 52:14.840
we have done well from
that particular constituency.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.680
Two nurses. A shop girl.

52:18.680 --> 52:22.719
Another, I believe, a whore
seeking not to be so any longer.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.040
And our last...

52:25.640 --> 52:28.440
Well, she was due to be
delivered this afternoon.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.279
Have I named her?

52:31.280 --> 52:33.360
Inspector?

52:35.240 --> 52:36.759
There is one more.

52:36.760 --> 52:39.639
You have described them all.
There were but eight cargo dockets.

52:39.640 --> 52:41.840
This one does not travel in the hold.

52:44.040 --> 52:46.599
She is far too precious for that.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.280
No, this one we keep close.

52:50.040 --> 52:52.520
We nurture, Inspector.

52:53.520 --> 52:56.199
For when she's grown just a few more years,

52:56.200 --> 52:58.880
well, imagine the price we shall fetch for her.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.520
It was you.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.120
The policeman on the boat that day.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.999
Victor told me how you screamed for your girl...

53:12.000 --> 53:14.439
You will tell me where you keep her!

53:14.440 --> 53:15.839
I will not!

53:15.840 --> 53:17.399
You wish to see brother Victor?

53:17.400 --> 53:18.920
Come. You shall!

53:22.360 --> 53:23.519
No!

53:23.520 --> 53:26.319
No! You watch, you watch.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.520
Where?!

53:34.520 --> 53:36.519
There is not much provided in this world

53:36.520 --> 53:38.279
which aids the course of justice.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.199
So we take what we can, Miss Silver.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.399
Do it, Sergeant!

53:41.400 --> 53:42.639
No! Stop!

53:42.640 --> 53:45.679
You will tell me? I will! Hold your arm!

53:45.680 --> 53:47.200
Victor!

53:50.800 --> 53:52.480
You work well.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.320
Help!

54:01.440 --> 54:02.960
With me!

54:12.360 --> 54:14.120
Gentle, Barnaby.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.199
Where did you find her?

54:50.200 --> 54:52.159
No, not from the boat.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.960
Merely alone on a street corner.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.239
Inspector, that day,

55:00.240 --> 55:02.600
Victor reported seeing no other.

55:05.080 --> 55:08.679
He said he thought it a miracle he was saved.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.400
Perhaps, then, he lived on borrowed time.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.160
He is dead, Miss Silver.

55:15.600 --> 55:18.039
By the hand of the last
girl he would have taken.

55:18.040 --> 55:20.079
Then in your cell, he...? Another.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.560
Made to look like him.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.879
No! You... you deceiver.

55:26.880 --> 55:29.159
No, you killer! No!

55:29.160 --> 55:30.879
No!

55:46.200 --> 55:47.240
Hello.

55:49.760 --> 55:51.200
I am Mr Reid.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.399
'Dear Bennet.'

56:06.400 --> 56:10.239
I wish that this letter finds you
well and in good health.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.039
I myself continue to improve

56:12.040 --> 56:15.279
under the auspices of Mrs
Reid's generous charity.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.039
There are many things I regret in this life,

56:18.040 --> 56:21.880
but it is the way I have behaved
with you that brings me most shame.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.519
And this is Miss Goren.

57:03.520 --> 57:05.599
You'll be safe here.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.240
She is a good friend to us.

57:30.840 --> 57:31.880
Come on.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.200
Morning. Morning.

57:53.520 --> 57:55.240
Sergeant. Mr Reid.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.359
Chief Inspector Abberline?

58:01.360 --> 58:03.079
Notable by his absence.

58:03.080 --> 58:06.679
That man, I never knew one that
needed his pipes cleaned more.

58:07.920 --> 58:09.759
Mr Reid, Sir. What is it, Sergeant?

58:09.760 --> 58:12.039
Ironmongers at Nelson. Wagstaff?

58:12.040 --> 58:13.839
His creditors foreclose

58:13.840 --> 58:16.719
and he has shut his doors
with four of his customers inside.

58:16.720 --> 58:19.359
Swears to murder them all,
if the bailiffs come for him.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.679
Is he armed? Yes, Sir.

58:21.680 --> 58:22.960
Well?

58:25.560 --> 58:26.720
Shall we?
