00:01.363 --> 00:03.999
How do I know that
girl Vince is talkin' to?

00:04.033 --> 00:05.967
- That's Sasha Grey.
- The porn star?!

00:06.002 --> 00:10.105
Former colleague Lizzie Grant is trying
to take clients. Who's she working for?

00:10.139 --> 00:13.275
Vince isn't gonna be the face of some
Tequila company. He's not aunt Jemima.

00:13.309 --> 00:15.510
- I read a script this morning.
I want to do it. - Okay.

00:15.545 --> 00:17.179
- Stamos sent it to me.
- Jesus.

00:17.213 --> 00:20.882
This is awkward. I happened to see
your search history on the computer.

00:20.917 --> 00:21.950
Can we talk about this tonight?

00:21.984 --> 00:23.552
I might be hiding
from you tonight.

00:23.586 --> 00:25.654
I want Saget.
I wish I could've done more.

00:25.688 --> 00:29.191
- What's up, Vince? - This Tequila's special.
I want to involved.

00:29.225 --> 00:32.594
- This is Sasha. - This is the man,
the myth, the legend... Stan Lee.

00:32.628 --> 00:35.063
- Oh, you look familiar.
- How'd the meeting go?

00:35.098 --> 00:37.833
Not great. Vince brought Sasha
and apparently he was drunk.

00:37.867 --> 00:40.001
<i>Good evening, Ari.
Please don't tell me</i>

00:40.036 --> 00:41.470
<i>you're the one who
picked up the stray Lizzie.</i>

00:41.504 --> 00:43.839
Anyone she wants,
I'm going after.

00:43.873 --> 00:45.741
Well, she's going
after you too, Ari.

00:45.775 --> 00:47.743
<i>I'm going to make your life
miserable like you once made mine.</i>

00:47.777 --> 00:49.778
Good night, Ari.

02:12.094 --> 02:15.330
We're having our own private launch
party for our new Tequila company.

02:15.364 --> 02:16.898
<i>Name, Vin.
Give 'em the name.</i>

02:16.932 --> 02:18.333
Uh, Tequila Avion.

02:18.367 --> 02:20.335
- Avion.
- Avion.

02:20.369 --> 02:23.671
- Huh-uh, Avion.
- Avion!

02:23.706 --> 02:25.640
And who is this?

02:25.674 --> 02:27.242
This is my friend Sasha.

02:27.276 --> 02:29.010
Aren't we more
than friends by now?

02:29.045 --> 02:31.246
Oh no no, we are.
We're very good friends.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.182
- And this is my friend.
- Alex.

02:34.216 --> 02:36.484
Notice how she didn't say
we're more than friends?

02:36.519 --> 02:38.686
You don't make a move soon,
Turtle, I'm gonna have to.

02:38.721 --> 02:41.489
- What, am I not here?
- I'm just saying.

02:41.524 --> 02:44.559
He's made moves.
We're just taking it slow.

02:44.593 --> 02:47.796
Real slow.
Like the 405 at rush hour. Ow.

02:47.830 --> 02:50.799
Well, Alex, all I know is I've
had a lot of sex in my life

02:50.833 --> 02:53.435
and the best sex I've ever
had was while drinking this.

02:53.469 --> 02:55.737
Can we quote international star

02:55.771 --> 02:57.872
of stage and screen
Sasha Grey on that?

02:57.907 --> 03:01.543
I'm not shy. Drink this and you'll
have the best sex of your life.

03:01.577 --> 03:05.213
Guys can fuck like me and girls
can fuck like a porn star.

03:05.247 --> 03:07.949
Come on, Vince.

03:07.983 --> 03:09.751
That was awesome.

03:09.785 --> 03:12.153
Oh my God.

03:12.188 --> 03:15.657
So what is the deal?
Are you two gonna bang or what?

03:15.691 --> 03:17.459
Jesus, Drama.
I thought you were dead.

03:17.493 --> 03:20.228
No, I'm just unemployed,
sad and lonely.

03:20.262 --> 03:23.631
Don't worry, I'm saving a piece of
my piece of this company for you.

03:23.666 --> 03:25.366
That makes me feel much better.

03:25.401 --> 03:28.303
Say something on camera about it.
You're a pseudo-celeb.

03:28.337 --> 03:31.573
I don't drink Tequila.
I drink Johnny blue

03:31.607 --> 03:33.575
'cause I'm not
a pseudo-man like you.

03:33.609 --> 03:36.277
- All right, you're out.
- I am out.

03:36.312 --> 03:39.781
Doesn't drink Tequila.
Huh, what a loser.

03:39.815 --> 03:41.282
What?

03:41.317 --> 03:42.784
I was gonna kiss you.

03:42.818 --> 03:45.120
- You've already kissed me.
- Fine, then I won't.

03:45.154 --> 03:47.622
Why? Why do you like
teasing me so much?

03:47.656 --> 03:49.224
I told you, I'm not that easy.

03:49.258 --> 03:51.025
No, you're like breaking
into fort knox.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.228
Then I guess you'd
better keep trying.

03:55.097 --> 03:58.399
Yay, Turtle.

04:01.203 --> 04:03.004
Okay, so what are we
looking at here?

04:03.038 --> 04:06.074
Well, sexual harassment maybe.
Wrongful termination possibly.

04:06.108 --> 04:08.209
I didn't terminate her.
She quit.

04:08.244 --> 04:10.879
She felt that she was overlooked
for a promotion she deserved.

04:10.913 --> 04:12.614
I would have given it to her.

04:12.648 --> 04:15.817
Whose side are you on?
I didn't do anything wrong here.

04:15.851 --> 04:17.685
Obviously Amanda Daniels
disagrees.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.454
Why would she be willing to spend
her money supporting Lizzie?

04:20.488 --> 04:22.357
- To get back at me.
- For what?

04:22.391 --> 04:25.493
He stopped her from getting a job
she wanted once upon a time also.

04:25.528 --> 04:26.895
There is no case here.

04:26.929 --> 04:29.097
You say Lizzie's written
down things you've said?

04:29.131 --> 04:32.167
- Yes, in a journal.
- Yeah, made-up words obviously.

04:32.201 --> 04:35.670
- Obviously. - Look, it's her
word against mine, right?

04:35.704 --> 04:38.840
They'll subpoena everyone in this office.
What might they say?

04:38.874 --> 04:40.608
What do you think
they might say?

04:40.643 --> 04:43.678
He told me I'd look good with a
ball gag in my mouth last week.

04:43.712 --> 04:46.014
- Ari.
- Lloyd!

04:47.783 --> 04:49.551
- Yes?
- What would you say

04:49.585 --> 04:52.153
about my treatment of you
over the last five years?

04:52.188 --> 04:54.722
- Treatment?
- This is Jim Lefkowitz, Lloyd.

04:54.757 --> 04:56.925
- Our attorney.
- Attorney?

04:56.959 --> 04:59.694
- What's going on?
- The lovely Lizzie Grant may sue me.

04:59.728 --> 05:02.330
And you, Lloyd, and everyone
who works here may be asked

05:02.364 --> 05:05.533
to describe how Ari treats his employees.
So what would you say?

05:05.568 --> 05:09.270
Ari has always been gracious
and lovely, fair and reasonable.

05:09.305 --> 05:11.839
This has been a dreamlike job
from minute one.

05:11.874 --> 05:13.408
And would you say that
if you were under oath,

05:13.442 --> 05:15.543
facing a perjury charge
and possible jail time?

05:15.578 --> 05:20.348
Oh God, I can't do time, Ari.
I don't think anybody in my family could.

05:20.382 --> 05:22.817
- I'm sorry.
- Go!

05:22.851 --> 05:25.053
So do you think others
would speak better of him?

05:25.087 --> 05:27.121
Worse is my guess.

05:27.156 --> 05:29.490
What do you suggest?

05:29.525 --> 05:32.794
Well, I mean, you're trying to bring an N.
F.L. team to Los Angeles.

05:32.828 --> 05:36.197
- So? - So the N.F.L.
doesn't like controversy.

05:36.232 --> 05:38.900
This goes to trial, win or lose, that's over.
You know that.

05:38.934 --> 05:40.935
And your wife and kids
won't like it either.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.570
I haven't done anything wrong.

05:42.605 --> 05:45.073
- Jim, what do you suggest?
- I suggest you offer Ms. Grant

05:45.107 --> 05:47.575
a generous amount of money
to not pursue legal action.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.612
I already offered her
a generous severance package.

05:50.646 --> 05:52.313
I'm offering her nothing else.

05:52.348 --> 05:55.016
I'll call her new boss
and convince her

05:55.050 --> 05:57.885
not to waste her time
or her money on this thing.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.256
Just make sure she doesn't
write down everything you say.

06:01.290 --> 06:04.325
- She's right.
- Jake!

06:04.360 --> 06:06.961
Get Amanda Daniels
on the phone.

06:08.364 --> 06:09.697
- Morning, E.
- Morning.

06:09.732 --> 06:11.099
Late night?
You look tired.

06:11.133 --> 06:12.934
I was up till 10:00
tasting wedding cakes.

06:12.968 --> 06:14.335
I'm not tired, I'm nauseous.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.638
- Any sign of an offer for Vince?
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.672 --> 06:19.440
- How is it?
- Oh, I didn't look.

06:19.475 --> 06:21.843
Okay, it's incredible.

06:23.212 --> 06:25.580
- Wow. Scott!
- Oh, and a Billy Walsh called.

06:25.614 --> 06:27.782
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah, why, who is he?

06:27.816 --> 06:30.084
He was supposed to be a big director for a minute.
Never heard of him?

06:30.119 --> 06:31.886
- Shall I call him back?
- No, but call Ari.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.755
Tell him I want to talk to
him about this. Thank you.

06:33.789 --> 06:35.423
Yes, Murray, I know.

06:35.457 --> 06:38.059
Yes, Murray, I know.
Eric's here, he says hello.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.560
- Hi, Murray.
- He says hi, yeah.

06:39.595 --> 06:41.829
Okay, I love you. I really do.
Have a good trip.

06:41.864 --> 06:44.499
- Have fun. Okay, bye. I hate myself.
- What's the problem?

06:44.533 --> 06:47.068
- He wants me to babysit his house.
- He's got a nice house.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.470
He also has two pugs that do
nothing but snore and shit.

06:49.505 --> 06:51.706
- Don't worry about that.
Look at this. - What is it?

06:51.740 --> 06:53.708
Vince's offer
for "air-walker."

06:55.311 --> 06:58.780
- Back end?
- Huge, and 12 upfront.

06:58.814 --> 07:01.015
Holy shit!

07:01.050 --> 07:02.984
I have Billy Walsh again.

07:03.018 --> 07:05.386
Tell him I'm out of town
or something like that.

07:05.421 --> 07:07.822
- Did you call Ari?
- I left word with his assistant.

07:07.856 --> 07:09.957
Call him back, tell him
we're heading down there.

07:09.992 --> 07:11.659
- We are?
- Yes. You can be

07:11.694 --> 07:14.495
my eyewitness that he had
absolutely nothing to do with this.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.564
I can do that.

07:19.335 --> 07:22.770
Johnny, you've got
to stop drinking.

07:22.805 --> 07:25.440
- Why? - 'Cause you've been
going for 16 straight hours.

07:25.474 --> 07:28.009
<i>- So have you.
- Yeah, but I'm happy drinking.</i>

07:28.043 --> 07:31.245
I'm gonna keep doing it
until I get a job.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.947
Maybe you should do a play.

07:32.981 --> 07:35.016
I'd love to, bro,
but I can't afford it.

07:35.050 --> 07:36.751
My mortgage rate's
ready to reset.

07:36.785 --> 07:39.887
Whatever movie I do next I'm making
sure there's a role in it for you.

07:39.922 --> 07:42.724
- Vince... - And I got your
mortgage until you find a job.

07:42.758 --> 07:44.992
And that will be
pretty soon I'm sure.

07:45.027 --> 07:47.628
How do you know, bro?
I was on a series six months ago.

07:47.663 --> 07:50.631
I haven't had an offer since.
Correction...

07:50.666 --> 07:53.601
dos equis asked me to be the least
interesting man in the world.

07:53.635 --> 07:56.204
Johnny, this town is
up and down, up and down.

07:56.238 --> 07:58.306
You know that.
I mean, look at me.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.375
I was done, but I came back.

08:00.409 --> 08:02.810
- And you will too.
- I hope so, bro.

08:02.845 --> 08:04.946
But for now, let me
wallow in my misery.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.914
Stop wallowing with my Tequila.

08:06.949 --> 08:10.251
- I'm gonna run out of samples. - Boo.
What, are you in a bad mood too?

08:10.285 --> 08:12.286
- No, why?
- You look sad.

08:12.321 --> 08:14.155
I guess he couldn't close Alex.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.923
It was looking
pretty good to me.

08:15.958 --> 08:17.425
I closed.
I closed.

08:17.459 --> 08:19.761
- Great, so how was it?
- For me or for her?

08:19.795 --> 08:22.997
We know it couldn't have been any good
for her, so let's hear about you.

08:23.031 --> 08:25.566
But first, have a drink.

08:25.601 --> 08:27.802
- It's 10:00 A.M.
- Suit yourself.

08:27.836 --> 08:29.937
Top me off, bro.

08:29.972 --> 08:31.572
So what happened?

08:31.607 --> 08:34.609
I really don't want
to talk about this.

08:34.643 --> 08:36.878
Lighten up, Turtle.
If it's any consolation,

08:36.912 --> 08:39.113
this moonshine of yours
is starting to grow on me.

08:39.148 --> 08:41.149
- Great.
- Come on, tell us what happened.

08:41.183 --> 08:43.618
I closed.

08:43.652 --> 08:45.787
I did.
I just didn't close well.

08:45.821 --> 08:48.322
What, did you pop off early?
It's been a long time for you.

08:48.357 --> 08:50.158
Yeah, Turtle,
that's no big deal.

08:50.192 --> 08:52.527
No, it wasn't that.
It just didn't start out so good

08:52.561 --> 08:54.462
and then I couldn't
find my groove.

08:54.496 --> 08:56.063
What, you didn't eat it right?

08:56.098 --> 08:58.633
- Disaster.
- I'm sure you're just imagining it.

08:58.667 --> 09:01.736
No, I'm not. And the truth is I've
been imagining it for a month.

09:01.770 --> 09:04.238
She is so hot and then finally

09:04.273 --> 09:08.109
I was all ready and I made
my way down there and...

09:08.143 --> 09:10.244
- What?
- Nothing.

09:10.279 --> 09:12.447
- Something.
- You guys are gonna laugh at me.

09:12.481 --> 09:13.915
- No we won't.
- No no no.

09:13.949 --> 09:17.685
Okay, I made my way down
there just as the sun came up.

09:17.719 --> 09:20.054
The harsh light hit it directly

09:20.088 --> 09:21.956
and it was completely
bald and I freaked.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.425
<i>Yeah, see?</i>

09:24.460 --> 09:27.094
I'm sorry.
Why did you freak?

09:27.129 --> 09:28.930
Seriously, Turtle.
I love that.

09:28.964 --> 09:32.433
It's like you peel back the curtains
to reveal the mystery of oz.

09:32.468 --> 09:34.068
I don't have a problem with it.

09:34.102 --> 09:36.804
It's just that close up
with the sun, it shocked me.

09:36.839 --> 09:38.940
What, you saw
a shaved box before?

09:38.974 --> 09:41.275
I have in porn.
Just not in 3d.

09:41.310 --> 09:44.278
I've been with girls who were
nicely groomed... landing strip.

09:44.313 --> 09:46.714
The landing strip went out
in the mid 90s, bro.

09:46.748 --> 09:49.450
It's the truth.
Everyone goes smooth nowadays.

09:49.485 --> 09:52.253
- Even you, I bet.
- Smooth balls for sure.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.455
And I hope you do
yours as well.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.824
- I don't groom my dick, no.
- Are you kidding?

09:56.859 --> 09:58.993
It's 2010;
You'd better.

09:59.027 --> 10:01.863
- Do people really do this, Vin?
- I only know about my own dick.

10:01.897 --> 10:03.898
And, Turtle, you should
only worry about yours.

10:03.932 --> 10:06.567
But listen, you haven't been
with many chicks since Jamie.

10:06.602 --> 10:08.569
Many meaning zero.

10:08.604 --> 10:10.705
And you were nervous.
So I'm sure you did fine.

10:10.739 --> 10:13.274
No, I didn't.
I need another shot.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.510
- Well, I am sure you will get one.
- I hope.

10:15.544 --> 10:18.646
Well, if you do, you'd better do
a little courtesy manscaping.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.716
Can't have your dick
looking like a chia pet, bro.

10:24.986 --> 10:27.888
Can I just get a little support?
At least tell me I'm not crazy.

10:27.922 --> 10:29.890
No, you're not crazy.
Murray's hard on you.

10:29.924 --> 10:32.126
People get into patterns
in work relationships.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.561
Sometimes it's hard to get out of them.
You'll see with Ari and I.

10:34.596 --> 10:36.397
- Why? How's that go?
- Well, he's a dick.

10:36.431 --> 10:38.499
- Better not be a dick to me.
- Take it easy.

10:38.533 --> 10:41.668
Would it be so bad if I gave Ari gold
a smack in front of all his peers?

10:41.703 --> 10:43.704
Hey, Eric, and...

10:43.738 --> 10:45.272
- Scott.
- Scott.

10:45.306 --> 10:48.275
I told your office now is not a good time.
Ari is not in a great mood.

10:48.309 --> 10:50.844
- Has that whore called me back yet?
- Told you.

10:50.879 --> 10:52.646
No, not yet.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.715
- I'm gonna cheer him up, Jake.
- No, Eric, wait.

10:54.749 --> 10:56.984
- Uh, Ari...
- Hey, Ari.

10:57.018 --> 10:58.986
What is this, the Big Brother
program of America?

10:59.020 --> 11:00.954
- Except who's the Big Brother?
- This is Scott Lavin.

11:00.989 --> 11:03.223
<i>- So? - I called you last
week twice about Vince.</i>

11:03.258 --> 11:06.126
What are you two doing in my office when
you don't have a meeting on the books?

11:06.161 --> 11:08.429
- Is he kidding?
- We're here for Vince.

11:09.531 --> 11:11.031
Vince.
You remember Vince?

11:11.066 --> 11:13.500
He doesn't play in the N.F.L.
but he still makes a good amount of money.

11:13.535 --> 11:16.970
Who the fuck are you and why am I
wasting my time listening to you?

11:17.005 --> 11:19.039
E, I got a lot on my plate.
Speak fast.

11:19.074 --> 11:20.474
We got a big offer for Vince.

11:20.508 --> 11:23.243
Could be worth $100 million
over three movies.

11:23.278 --> 11:25.746
- Look, now he's paying attention.
- Scott.

11:27.649 --> 11:29.783
<i>- Randall Wallace?
- And Stan Lee.</i>

11:29.818 --> 11:32.586
- Why don't I know about this?
- 'Cause you don't call anybody back.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.254
- I'll call Vince myself.
- Don't do that.

11:34.289 --> 11:37.091
Truth is we got this done without you but
we obviously care about your opinion.

11:37.125 --> 11:40.394
Thank you, I appreciate it.
The truth is I've been a little under it lately.

11:40.428 --> 11:42.029
<i>- N.F.L.?
- Personal stuff.</i>

11:42.063 --> 11:43.730
Oh wow.
Everything okay with the family?

11:43.765 --> 11:45.466
<i>- Yeah, thanks.
- Amanda Daniels.</i>

11:45.500 --> 11:47.468
<i>- I've got to take this.
- She's on her way up.</i>

11:47.502 --> 11:49.036
- She's on her way up?
- Uh-huh.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.804
- What are you doing with Amanda?
- Nothing.

11:50.839 --> 11:52.406
You hitting that?

11:52.440 --> 11:55.409
Look, you guys got to go.
This is really important.

11:55.443 --> 11:57.511
I will call you as soon as I
go over this very thoroughly.

11:57.545 --> 12:00.647
- He is hitting that.
- Listen, e, I'll call you in an hour.

12:00.682 --> 12:04.351
Make sure that your dopplegang-banger
stays off the line. Go!

12:06.121 --> 12:08.322
- Hello, Amanda.
- Hello, Eric.

12:08.356 --> 12:11.558
- Get the fuck out. - Don't ever
touch me again, you fucking jerkoff.

12:11.593 --> 12:13.193
What are you
doing here, Amanda?

12:13.228 --> 12:15.562
You called and I thought you
might threaten me to my face.

12:15.597 --> 12:18.465
- No one wants to threaten you, okay?
- Then what do you want?

12:18.500 --> 12:21.001
I just simply want to know
if you really want to burn

12:21.035 --> 12:24.304
every last dollar that you have
trying to slander my name.

12:24.339 --> 12:26.073
<i>- Slander?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

12:26.107 --> 12:27.908
No, I read Lizzie's journals.

12:27.942 --> 12:30.344
There's some pretty horrific
stuff in there, even for you.

12:30.378 --> 12:33.547
- Why are you doing this? - Because once
upon a time you walked into my office

12:33.581 --> 12:36.617
and you took a job away from me that
I deserved simply because you could.

12:36.651 --> 12:39.853
- So it's about payback?
- No no, this is like arms control.

12:39.888 --> 12:44.091
See, you're like Iran and I need to take
away your weapons because you're reckless.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.126
You're smart enough to know
it's only a matter of time

12:46.161 --> 12:48.562
before I scoop up one of your
castoffs and sue you right back.

12:48.596 --> 12:50.330
Unlike you,

12:50.365 --> 12:52.699
I had the foresight
to work Lizzie for a while.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.202
So I have proof,
you'd only have hearsay.

12:55.236 --> 12:58.472
Lizzie's little work-of-fiction
journal proves that I'm guilty

12:58.506 --> 13:01.909
like Lindsay "blow-han" proves
that fame is fucking healthy.

13:01.943 --> 13:04.678
She has recordings of you too.

13:04.712 --> 13:06.346
<i>- Your voice.
- Bullshit.</i>

13:06.381 --> 13:08.582
Oh, it's true.
The tapes are so clear

13:08.616 --> 13:10.317
it sounds like they were
professionally recorded.

13:10.351 --> 13:12.186
<i>- You heard them?
- I listened to them, yeah,</i>

13:12.220 --> 13:14.988
the last three nights and played
with myself while fantasizing

13:15.023 --> 13:17.691
about fucking you in the ass.

13:17.725 --> 13:20.260
Anything else you wanted to say?
I freed up my afternoon.

13:20.295 --> 13:23.397
You follow through on this
and you're starting a war.

13:23.431 --> 13:26.200
Then man up, Ari,
because I love to battle.

13:27.368 --> 13:28.902
It's funny, you know.

13:28.937 --> 13:31.305
This was actually less
hostile than I expected.

13:35.843 --> 13:38.979
So Vince has been tweeting
the shit out of the Tequila.

13:39.013 --> 13:40.514
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

13:40.548 --> 13:43.283
- Said he started a new company.
- That's great.

13:43.318 --> 13:44.885
I was thinking of
posting some of the videos.

13:44.919 --> 13:47.988
- The cool ones, not the silly ones.
- Yeah.

13:48.022 --> 13:50.624
Totally.

13:50.658 --> 13:52.626
How's your sandwich?

13:52.660 --> 13:55.162
Good.

13:55.196 --> 13:56.463
Cool.

13:56.497 --> 13:58.031
Better than last night.

13:59.334 --> 14:01.435
- What?
- I'm kidding.

14:01.469 --> 14:05.038
- No you weren't.
- Come on, it was awkward.

14:05.073 --> 14:08.475
<i>- You think? - I think maybe
we just did it too soon.</i>

14:08.509 --> 14:10.777
Or maybe we shouldn't
have done it at all.

14:10.812 --> 14:12.546
No no no, of course
we should have done it.

14:12.580 --> 14:13.880
It was my fault.
It was me.

14:13.915 --> 14:15.716
- I take full responsibility.
- For what?

14:15.750 --> 14:18.252
- For the awkwardness.
- What happened?

14:18.286 --> 14:21.421
We were having a great time and then
the second the clothes came off

14:21.456 --> 14:24.057
you turned into a clumsy mute.

14:24.092 --> 14:25.726
I wasn't feeling great.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.061
<i>I don't know, Turtle.
Maybe we're just not meant to be like that.</i>

14:28.096 --> 14:30.998
I mean, Sasha said she had the best
sex of her life on our Tequila.

14:31.032 --> 14:32.733
I thought it was the worst.

14:32.767 --> 14:35.168
It wasn't the worst.

14:35.203 --> 14:37.471
Okay, you've got to give
me another shot.

14:37.505 --> 14:39.706
Maybe we're just meant
to be business partners.

14:39.741 --> 14:42.476
No no no, come on.
I will wine you and dine you

14:42.510 --> 14:45.078
and woo you and I will
blow your mind in bed.

14:45.113 --> 14:46.747
You think?

14:46.781 --> 14:48.849
Let me try.

14:48.883 --> 14:50.517
Okay.

14:50.551 --> 14:52.452
You can try.

14:52.487 --> 14:55.589
Excuse me.
Can I have some ketchup, please?

15:02.397 --> 15:04.197
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:04.232 --> 15:06.667
Hi, I'm William Walsh.
I'm an old friend of Vince's.

15:06.701 --> 15:08.902
I'm Sasha,
a new friend of Vince's.

15:08.936 --> 15:11.104
Billy Walsh.
Oh my God.

15:11.139 --> 15:13.407
Vince, how are you?
It's been awhile.

15:13.441 --> 15:15.309
I'll say. Come here.
How are you?

15:15.343 --> 15:18.378
- I'm okay.
- Hey, sash, this is Billy Walsh,

15:18.413 --> 15:20.380
- an amazing filmmaker.
- That's kind of you to say.

15:20.415 --> 15:22.883
I thought you looked
familiar, but different.

15:22.917 --> 15:24.651
I've been through
a lot and back again.

15:24.686 --> 15:26.353
- Can I come in?
- Of course, of course.

15:26.387 --> 15:30.090
Hey, Johnny, look who's here.

15:30.124 --> 15:33.093
Jeez, Billy Walsh.
It's like a mirage.

15:33.127 --> 15:36.396
- How are you, Drama?
- Peachy, Billy.

15:36.431 --> 15:38.265
I'm getting jerked off
by the network

15:38.299 --> 15:40.667
'cause nobody can find
a idea for me.

15:40.702 --> 15:42.235
You got one?

15:42.270 --> 15:44.171
Not off the top of my head, no.

15:44.205 --> 15:46.006
Superb.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.441
You seem angry, Drama.

15:47.475 --> 15:50.277
I've always been, Billy.
Only now I'm drunk too.

15:50.311 --> 15:53.380
- I shot a movie with you.
- Yeah, uh...

15:53.414 --> 15:56.216
You know, maybe this wasn't
the best place for me to come.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.019
Porn stars, alcohol,
manic depressives...

15:59.053 --> 16:02.823
I've avoided all temptation
for the last 24 months now.

16:02.857 --> 16:04.391
So what are you
doing here, Billy?

16:04.425 --> 16:07.260
I came to get back into
the business I left behind.

16:07.295 --> 16:10.897
Vince isn't gonna make another stinker with
you, Billy, if that's what you're thinking.

16:10.932 --> 16:15.168
- No, Vince isn't what I need at this point.
- So what do you need?

16:15.203 --> 16:17.037
E.

16:20.441 --> 16:22.109
Vince needs to get rid of Ari.

16:22.143 --> 16:25.145
- Enough already.
- I'm being serious.

16:25.179 --> 16:27.614
I mean, the guy is barely
even in the business anymore.

16:27.648 --> 16:30.751
What do you think is gonna happen when
he's standing on an N.F.L. sideline

16:30.785 --> 16:33.019
spending all his time
trying to bang cheerleaders?

16:33.054 --> 16:35.155
Look, Ari's got a big mouth
but he's done a lot by us.

16:35.189 --> 16:37.190
And he's obviously got
some serious stuff going on.

16:37.225 --> 16:39.659
So does Vince and he needs someone
who's gonna be on the ball.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.528
Are you telling me
you can't handle an offer?

16:41.562 --> 16:44.364
You can't make sure he's paid?
Make sure he has a nice trailer?

16:44.399 --> 16:46.767
Ari and Vince's attorneys
handle the little details.

16:46.801 --> 16:49.870
We can take it to his attorney.
We can handle the details.

16:49.904 --> 16:53.206
If Ari's so stressed out maybe he'd
appreciate you taking the reins on this one.

16:53.241 --> 16:55.442
Come on, aren't you tired
of being a pushover?

16:55.476 --> 16:57.244
- Who's a pushover?
- We both are.

16:57.278 --> 16:58.678
We handled
this thing for Vince.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.414
We're basically the ones
keeping this company afloat.

17:00.448 --> 17:02.849
- So now you're back to Murray?
- Of course I'm back to Murray.

17:02.884 --> 17:05.786
We do all the work.
I mean, the guy is literally never here.

17:05.819 --> 17:07.921
- I wouldn't say never.
- You wouldn't say never?

17:07.954 --> 17:10.991
Murray!
Hey, Murray!

17:11.025 --> 17:13.492
- Anyone seen Murray, ever?
- Are you on drugs?

17:13.528 --> 17:15.962
No, I'm fucking angry,
as you should be too.

17:15.997 --> 17:18.064
- About what, Murray or Ari?
- About both of them.

17:18.098 --> 17:21.334
They are checking out, okay?
We cannot.

17:21.368 --> 17:23.303
This is our future, all right?

17:23.337 --> 17:25.105
You saw how we handled
this deal with Vince.

17:25.138 --> 17:26.906
You saw how we handled Ari.

17:26.941 --> 17:29.443
We can run Vince and this company
without either one of them.

17:29.477 --> 17:31.878
You do realize that I'm marrying
Murray's god-daughter, right?

17:31.913 --> 17:34.948
- The one who got me this job.
- Family before business, I get it.

17:34.982 --> 17:37.884
But you and Sloan are about to start
your own family so you need to start...

17:37.919 --> 17:40.720
- shauna's on the phone and she's
freaking out. - Who isn't?

17:40.755 --> 17:43.557
She says that Vince tweeted that
he started some Tequila company

17:43.591 --> 17:45.692
and Turtle posted some
racy videos about it.

17:45.726 --> 17:48.061
Awesome.

17:56.904 --> 18:00.207
No, I did not know that Vince
was dating a porn star, shauna.

18:01.742 --> 18:05.111
No, I didn't know he started
his own tequila company either.

18:05.146 --> 18:06.980
I have to go.

18:07.014 --> 18:10.617
Lizzie Grant.
I didn't know that you ate here.

18:10.651 --> 18:12.252
Well, I know you don't eat here

18:12.286 --> 18:14.287
'cause you don't like,
and I'm quoting,

18:14.322 --> 18:16.523
"eating with all
the pussy-ass bitch agents."

18:16.557 --> 18:19.392
You know what?
I have grown to love my own kind.

18:19.427 --> 18:21.328
- Are you following me?
- You can't prove it.

18:21.362 --> 18:24.231
You would be amazed
at what I could prove.

18:24.265 --> 18:26.199
- I talked to your boss.
- I'm aware.

18:26.234 --> 18:29.236
Yeah, she may use nicer words but
she's a much worse person than me.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.304
Anyone in this town
could tell you that.

18:31.339 --> 18:33.406
That is so funny
because she swears

18:33.441 --> 18:35.775
you're the worst person
she's ever dealt with.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.612
- Stealing clients...
- Have you ever seen me steal clients?

18:38.646 --> 18:40.714
Ari, I have no interest
in talking to you.

18:40.748 --> 18:44.217
Well, I have an interest
in you not sullying my name.

18:44.252 --> 18:46.486
So tell me what you want.

18:46.521 --> 18:48.989
- What I want?
- Yes.

18:49.023 --> 18:51.191
How much money to settle

18:51.225 --> 18:53.860
so we don't end up in court
where you will lose?

18:53.895 --> 18:58.064
A writer's assistant on a sitcom
once sued for inappropriate talk.

18:58.099 --> 19:00.634
It went to the supreme court.
You know what they told her?

19:00.668 --> 19:04.137
They told her that the writers
can talk about gang-banging her

19:04.171 --> 19:06.640
all day long as long
as they don't do it.

19:06.674 --> 19:08.608
I know the case.
They're creative.

19:08.643 --> 19:11.645
You're certainly not.
So you can talk about gang-banging all day,

19:11.679 --> 19:13.713
but you're the only one
who's gonna get fucked.

19:13.748 --> 19:15.248
- 100,000.
- No.

19:15.283 --> 19:16.983
- 250.
- How about 10 million?

19:17.018 --> 19:20.186
- Don't be absurd.
- You think I'm being absurd?

19:20.221 --> 19:22.489
I think that you're
whoring yourself out

19:22.523 --> 19:24.524
to a witch of a woman
who is trying to get you

19:24.559 --> 19:27.594
to slander a good family man's name.

19:27.628 --> 19:29.796
$1 million not to sue.

19:29.830 --> 19:32.165
Ari, I cannot tell you

19:32.199 --> 19:34.701
how good it makes me feel
to watch you squirm.

19:34.735 --> 19:37.404
But you can rest easy, 'cause
I've already told Amanda

19:37.438 --> 19:39.406
that I'm not gonna sue you.
So keep your money.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.374
- You're not?
- No.

19:41.409 --> 19:45.111
I will make my money because
I'm smart and I'm talented,

19:45.146 --> 19:46.913
not because you're repugnant.

19:46.948 --> 19:49.149
I think you're doing
the right thing,

19:49.183 --> 19:51.351
because no one needs
to hear about our past.

19:51.385 --> 19:52.819
No, that's where you're wrong.

19:52.853 --> 19:54.955
Everyone needs to hear.

19:54.989 --> 19:57.824
I want the women of the world
to know how you treat them.

19:57.858 --> 19:59.759
What does that mean?

19:59.794 --> 20:01.194
Check "deadline Hollywood."

20:01.228 --> 20:03.263
I'm sure the story should
be posted sometime soon,

20:03.297 --> 20:04.864
unless you can buy them off.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.934
You sent tapes of me
to "deadline Hollywood"?

20:07.969 --> 20:09.469
Is that even legal?

20:09.503 --> 20:11.671
Sue me.

20:17.979 --> 20:20.180
I thought you wanted
to conserve your product.

20:20.214 --> 20:22.449
- I want to relax.
- You freaking about tonight?

20:22.483 --> 20:24.918
I'm not freaking,
I'm just on edge a little.

20:24.952 --> 20:27.821
Let me tell you, shoving that poison
down your throat is not the remedy.

20:27.855 --> 20:30.657
Poison?
This is 100% pure agave.

20:30.691 --> 20:33.827
The only remedy for you is
storming the hairless beaches.

20:33.861 --> 20:35.629
You're gonna be fine, Turtle.

20:35.663 --> 20:37.097
I don't normally have
performance issues.

20:37.131 --> 20:39.165
Yeah, you perform
as often as led zeppelin.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.501
You should probably take a cab.
Or I can drive you.

20:41.535 --> 20:42.736
You should take a cab.

20:42.770 --> 20:45.205
I like you two as my parents.

20:45.239 --> 20:47.774
<i>- Hey, Vin, where's the can?
- To the left.</i>

20:47.808 --> 20:50.310
Yo, Turtle, you want a Cialis?

20:50.344 --> 20:52.345
No.
Maybe.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.648
Hi, I need a cab
for 3750 longo.

20:54.682 --> 20:56.616
Johnny, why do you
carry around Cialis?

20:56.651 --> 20:58.752
In case I really
got to bury one.

20:58.786 --> 21:01.855
- You should use kaboom.
You get a bigger bang. - Good tip.

21:01.889 --> 21:04.324
E, to what do we owe
this pleasure?

21:04.358 --> 21:06.660
Turtle posted a video
of you and Sasha on Twitter.

21:06.694 --> 21:08.428
I just got
reamed out by shauna.

21:08.462 --> 21:10.797
That was unintentional.
I edited smaller parts.

21:10.831 --> 21:13.333
- I just accidentally uploaded the whole thing.
- I thought it was cute.

21:13.367 --> 21:15.268
A movie star telling guys
to fuck like him

21:15.302 --> 21:17.570
and girls to fuck like
a porn star isn't cute, Vince.

21:17.605 --> 21:19.139
<i>- I said that?
- Yes.</i>

21:19.173 --> 21:21.641
- You did. - I'm sure the way
I said it was very charming.

21:21.676 --> 21:24.678
Turtle, what happened? I thought the Tequila
company was gonna be on the down low.

21:24.712 --> 21:26.413
No, it only went out
to my Twitter followers.

21:26.447 --> 21:28.548
- You have a million and a
half followers. - I do?

21:28.582 --> 21:30.784
Yeah, now t.M.Z.,
Perez Hilton

21:30.818 --> 21:32.886
and just Jared all want to know
if Sasha's your girlfriend.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.487
Well, tell them she is.

21:34.522 --> 21:36.790
I thought we were
just really good friends.

21:36.824 --> 21:39.359
Look, Vince, you just got the biggest
offer of your career today, all right?

21:39.393 --> 21:41.661
- I just want to make sure you're focused.
- I'm focused.

21:41.696 --> 21:44.164
- I'm focused. Aren't I focused?
- Seems focused to me.

21:44.198 --> 21:46.700
You see? So how was the offer?
Was it good?

21:46.734 --> 21:49.135
Yeah, it's great.
Ari's looking it over right now.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.037
All right.
Well, things are happening.

21:51.072 --> 21:54.040
No kidding. Check out this b.
B.M. I got today.

21:55.743 --> 21:58.812
E, I've tried you several
times at the office.

21:58.846 --> 22:02.382
I would love it if you could see yourself
giving me five minutes of your time.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.551
- Technology is amazing.
- What's amazing

22:04.585 --> 22:06.920
is that somebody gave this clown my b.
B.M. Address.

22:06.954 --> 22:09.089
Hey, suit.
Long time.

22:14.795 --> 22:18.231
Do you want Jerry Jones?

22:18.265 --> 22:21.134
And you still haven't
called back Jeff Katzenberg

22:21.168 --> 22:22.869
or Mike Meldman
or Tracy Morgan.

22:22.903 --> 22:25.538
I don't want to talk to anybody.
Was I not clear?

22:25.573 --> 22:28.041
Nobody! I don't care if
Justin Bieber calls

22:28.075 --> 22:31.177
and wants me to negotiate
the rights to his virginity.

22:31.212 --> 22:33.747
I don't want to talk to him.
Nobody!

22:34.749 --> 22:37.717
Uh, your wife is here.

22:37.752 --> 22:40.487
- Hello, Mrs. gold.
Ari doesn't wish to speak... - Hello.

22:40.521 --> 22:42.455
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:42.490 --> 22:45.158
- You shouldn't talk to your assistants like that.
- I know, I'm sorry.

22:45.192 --> 22:47.494
- What are you doing here?
- I told you I was coming by with the swatches

22:47.528 --> 22:48.928
so that we could
redo your office.

22:48.963 --> 22:50.463
- Oh.
- You forgot.

22:50.498 --> 22:52.766
- No, I... - Okay, what do
you think of this one?

22:52.800 --> 22:54.868
- Like it.
- You didn't even look.

22:54.902 --> 22:56.236
No no, I glanced.

22:56.270 --> 22:58.638
Baby, I got quick eyeballs.
U know that.

22:58.672 --> 23:00.673
And I trust your taste.
You have amazing taste.

23:00.708 --> 23:03.376
- And I love that.
- I'd like you to be involved.

23:03.410 --> 23:05.845
- Why? - It would give us something
that we could do together.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.881
Something we could do...
we do everything together.

23:07.915 --> 23:10.784
<i>- No, not anymore we don't.
- What do you mean?</i>

23:10.818 --> 23:13.853
- Since the merger.
- What since the merger?

23:13.888 --> 23:16.022
<i>- I don't feel good.
- Why?</i>

23:16.056 --> 23:19.392
Because you're never home.
Now with this N.F.L. thing...

23:19.426 --> 23:21.427
- that may not happen.
- Why not?

23:21.462 --> 23:23.663
- It may not happen.
- Why not? What's happening?

23:23.697 --> 23:25.298
Nothing.

23:25.332 --> 23:27.867
I feel like you've been keeping
a lot of secrets lately.

23:27.902 --> 23:31.037
Honey, no. Listen,
let's go to an early dinner,

23:31.071 --> 23:33.706
just the two of us.
We'll talk about everything. All right?

23:33.741 --> 23:36.543
I'm sorry, Ari. Dana Gordon's on the line.
Says it's urgent about Vince.

23:36.577 --> 23:38.545
I'll call you in an hour,
take you to Madeo.

23:38.579 --> 23:40.880
- Just you and me, okay?
- Okay.

23:43.450 --> 23:45.118
Put her through.

23:45.152 --> 23:47.353
Dana, is this really important?

23:47.388 --> 23:50.723
If Vince is really gonna carry this
studio's next franchise, I'd say it is.

23:52.326 --> 23:54.227
Does that feel good?

23:54.261 --> 23:56.296
Amazing.

23:56.330 --> 23:58.298
- I told you I could do this.
- Yeah you can.

23:58.332 --> 24:01.167
- You're incredible.
- Shh.

24:03.103 --> 24:04.904
Sorry if I caused you
any stress.

24:04.939 --> 24:06.339
It's okay.

24:06.373 --> 24:08.208
I just thought
it was your first time.

24:08.242 --> 24:09.742
First time what?

24:09.777 --> 24:12.011
You know, having sex.

24:12.046 --> 24:14.247
Are you serious?

24:14.281 --> 24:17.116
- It's okay if it was.
- I'm 30.

24:17.151 --> 24:19.052
I'm just saying.

24:19.086 --> 24:21.788
You really think
I'm some ugly loser, huh?

24:21.822 --> 24:24.457
- I didn't say that.
- No, but the first time I tried to kiss you

24:24.491 --> 24:27.660
you looked at me like I was a
venereal disease. I'm cute.

24:27.695 --> 24:30.163
You are, Turtle,
and I didn't see it at first.

24:30.197 --> 24:32.432
- But I see it now.
- Good.

24:32.466 --> 24:34.801
But something was up
last night.

24:34.835 --> 24:37.604
- Just let it go.
- Was it me?

24:37.638 --> 24:39.272
No no, are you crazy?

24:39.306 --> 24:42.442
- Just tell me what it was.
- I'm immature.

24:42.476 --> 24:44.777
What do you mean?

24:44.812 --> 24:46.779
I've never been
with a girl before

24:46.814 --> 24:50.350
who was totally shaved
down there.

24:50.384 --> 24:52.318
- It freaked me out.
- Wow.

24:52.353 --> 24:54.020
- Yeah.
- You are immature.

24:54.054 --> 24:56.322
I know. I had dreams all
night about playing pac-man.

24:56.357 --> 24:59.425
- Pac-man?
- You know, pac-man.

25:01.061 --> 25:04.197
Oh my God.
Is that why you shaved too?

25:04.231 --> 25:06.099
Yeah, why?
You don't like it?

25:06.133 --> 25:08.768
No, I don't like it.

25:08.802 --> 25:12.272
Guys are supposed to trim,
not go totally bald.

25:12.306 --> 25:15.541
Thanks, Drama. So did I totally
just fuck this up again?

25:15.576 --> 25:18.011
No, it'll grow back.

25:21.548 --> 25:23.783
I really appreciate you taking
the time to meet with me.

25:23.817 --> 25:25.585
I didn't have
much choice, Billy.

25:25.619 --> 25:27.787
We all have choices
and I've made some bad ones.

25:27.821 --> 25:29.956
Yeah. What can I do
for you, Billy?

25:29.990 --> 25:33.459
I need you to help guide me out
of the toilet like you did Vince.

25:33.494 --> 25:37.363
- Why would you want me? - Because, man,
you were the first guy to believe in me.

25:37.398 --> 25:39.399
You found my first script,
you got me Vince,

25:39.433 --> 25:42.335
you got us the money.
And as much as I was hard on you,

25:42.369 --> 25:44.671
I always knew you were
the guy with the good eye.

25:44.705 --> 25:47.340
- We can't work together, Billy.
- Why not?

25:47.374 --> 25:50.310
Because there's too much
baggage and past.

25:50.344 --> 25:53.079
- Pretend we've never met.
- How could I do that?

25:53.113 --> 25:55.381
Well, essentially we haven't.
I don't drink anymore.

25:55.416 --> 25:57.517
- I don't do drugs. I don't curse.
- You don't curse?

25:57.551 --> 25:59.385
No, I've spent
the last three years

25:59.420 --> 26:01.721
becoming an ordained
minister in Santa fe.

26:01.755 --> 26:04.857
Got myself right
and I want to work.

26:04.892 --> 26:06.826
You want Vince?

26:06.860 --> 26:08.394
I want you to help me.

26:08.429 --> 26:11.497
I'll do anything...
commercials, tv, anything.

26:11.532 --> 26:13.066
I've changed.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.902
Still got that Pablo Escobar
tattoo on your back?

26:15.936 --> 26:17.804
No, I had it scraped off
with a bowie knife

26:17.838 --> 26:19.906
in a ritual
smokehouse ceremony.

26:19.940 --> 26:23.910
No, it's still there.
Some things haven't changed.

26:23.944 --> 26:26.112
- But I've got a family now.
- Oh, you have a kid?

26:26.146 --> 26:29.082
- I've got four.
- Four?

26:29.116 --> 26:31.217
Set of Irish twins,
set of actual twins

26:31.251 --> 26:32.919
and another one on the way.

26:32.953 --> 26:34.921
I thought we could
live on love,

26:34.955 --> 26:37.457
but tiny kids can't eat love.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.395
Look, Billy, I'm gonna
have to think about this.

26:42.429 --> 26:45.231
You know, Drama was telling me about
this network deal that he's got.

26:45.265 --> 26:47.900
Yeah, if you have any ideas, don't
be afraid to shoot them my way.

26:47.935 --> 26:50.403
Actually, I was already thinking
like maybe he's not having any luck

26:50.437 --> 26:52.438
because he's too ugly
to star in his own show.

26:52.473 --> 26:55.575
- Yeah, you've changed, Billy.
- Come on, don't be mad. I'm serious.

26:55.609 --> 26:58.478
Look, he doesn't have the face for
the screen but he's got the voice.

26:58.512 --> 27:01.214
- So what, you think he should do radio?
- No, I was thinking a cartoon.

27:01.248 --> 27:04.917
- Cartoon? - Yeah, like
"the simpsons" but angrier.

27:04.952 --> 27:07.820
E, Ari's here
and he's being a douche.

27:07.855 --> 27:10.623
You hear that voice?
How distinct and angry it is?

27:10.657 --> 27:12.158
Were you talking about me?

27:12.192 --> 27:14.394
- What's Ari want, Drama?
- He wants to talk to you.

27:14.428 --> 27:17.697
- I got a lot of ideas.
- Sit tight, Billy.

27:17.731 --> 27:20.633
Jesus, Billy, you're back and
apparently working at the gap.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.502
<i>- Hey, Ari.
- He needs representation, Ari.</i>

27:22.536 --> 27:26.706
- So does Vince. - Yes, he does.
Did you decide to start doing your job again?

27:26.740 --> 27:29.475
I close my eyes for one minute
and he's dating porn stars

27:29.510 --> 27:31.677
- and starting a Tequila company?
- Look, Ari...

27:31.712 --> 27:34.047
you look. I need to talk to him.
My wife's in the car.

27:34.081 --> 27:36.082
She's ready to shoot me
so I've got to talk fast.

27:36.116 --> 27:38.418
- I already spoke to shauna.
- Well, I talked to Dana

27:38.452 --> 27:40.520
and the director
and they're freaking out.

27:40.554 --> 27:44.290
How could you let this guy show up drunk
and with a porn star to a meeting?

27:44.324 --> 27:46.592
He took a Vicodin, Ari.
And I didn't let him.

27:46.627 --> 27:48.428
- How is he doing now?
- He's fine.

27:48.462 --> 27:50.663
The studio wants to sit down with
him to make sure that he is.

27:50.697 --> 27:52.131
Jesus.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.834
Look, is this thing real, the
relationship with the porn star?

27:54.868 --> 27:57.003
- What? No.
- You sure?

27:57.037 --> 27:59.472
Ari, Vince is fine.

27:59.506 --> 28:02.308
- Where is he? I want to talk to him.
- He's out by the pool.

28:10.184 --> 28:12.652
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Jesus.

28:12.686 --> 28:15.888
Vince, wake up.
You have more visitors.

28:15.923 --> 28:18.257
- Wake up.
- Yeah, he looks fine.

28:19.593 --> 28:21.994
Vinnie.

28:22.029 --> 28:24.730
Vinnie.
