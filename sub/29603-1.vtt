WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:07.072
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

00:16.283 --> 00:17.616
- When I was a kid, I

00:19.587 --> 00:20.753
had so much hope, you know?

00:20.755 --> 00:21.653
I had

00:24.325 --> 00:25.691
so much to look forward to.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.395
I kept getting older.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.497
And those things,
they never came.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.504
I kept waiting, but they...

00:38.506 --> 00:39.772
They never came.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.742
- [Tobin] And how'd
that make you feel?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.647
- Like I was drowning, like...

00:51.652 --> 00:53.318
I don't know, like I forgot
how to come up for air.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.591
(tense atmosphere music)

01:01.228 --> 01:03.362
Couldn't see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.400
- [Tobin] Why do
you hate yourself?

01:15.209 --> 01:16.475
- I don't like who I am.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.712
- Is it because you're a coward?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.417
- What?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.319
- Because you don't
have the guts to live?

01:27.321 --> 01:29.154
You're not man enough?

01:29.156 --> 01:30.255
Are you too weak?

01:31.358 --> 01:32.558
Are you too weak, huh?

01:32.560 --> 01:33.592
- No.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.426
- No?

01:34.428 --> 01:35.360
- No.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.195
- No?

01:36.197 --> 01:36.829
No?

01:36.831 --> 01:38.097
- No!

01:38.099 --> 01:38.797
No!

01:40.334 --> 01:41.200
- There he is.

01:41.836 --> 01:42.701
Yeah.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.238
You can't win when
you're the enemy.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.706
You'll lose every time.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.608
Did you see how
quickly you started

01:49.610 --> 01:51.610
to believe in
yourself once I was

01:51.612 --> 01:53.445
saying you were too
weak instead of you?

01:53.447 --> 01:54.413
- Yeah.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.714
- Life is about overcoming.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.882
It's part of the process.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.617
Now do you trust me?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.685
- Yes.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.687
- You're gonna
fight for your life?

02:01.689 --> 02:02.754
- Yes.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.589
- Louder.

02:03.591 --> 02:04.656
- Yes!

02:04.658 --> 02:05.691
- Tell the whole world!

02:05.693 --> 02:06.558
- Yes!

02:06.560 --> 02:09.794
(cheers and applause)

02:12.833 --> 02:13.832
- All right boys.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.767
Go for music.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.953
(uplifting atmosphere music)

02:17.954 --> 02:19.203
- There's always
going to be something

02:19.206 --> 02:21.273
trying to push you
down, you push back.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.875
And if you can do
that, you can take

02:22.877 --> 02:24.877
your life to places
you'd never imagine.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.445
I'm not gonna say
it's gonna be easy

02:26.447 --> 02:29.148
because life's not easy,
but that is what makes

02:29.150 --> 02:31.650
it great, that's what
makes it so fulfilling.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.353
Are you ready to
begin your new life?

02:35.623 --> 02:36.855
- [Nelson] I am.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.357
- [Tobin] Say yes to this.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.424
- What's his story?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.627
- That's John Kirby.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.896
Salesman, mid-thirties.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.631
Kinda a non-believer,
but he wants to be.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.366
Claims he's got
problems sleeping.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.700
- Put him on the list.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.735
Tell me about her.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.470
- Vicky Boyd.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.204
A single mother, this
is her fourth time here.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.374
- Fourth time and she
never got time with Tobin?

02:55.376 --> 02:56.642
- Nothing on our file.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.777
- Yeah, well we'll deal
with her on the floor.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.812
Third row, fifth chair.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.748
Woman with long
hair and glasses.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.884
What's his story?

03:05.886 --> 03:09.555
(tense atmosphere music)

03:10.858 --> 03:11.823
- It was...

03:12.826 --> 03:14.526
It was life-changing.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.862
This has been the greatest
day of my life, no question.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.766
- [Victor] Great
job today, Jefe.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.501
- You think so?

03:22.503 --> 03:23.702
- Absolutely.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.205
So do you have
time to talk about

03:26.207 --> 03:27.839
the candidates for the retreat?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.608
- I trust you.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.677
If you like them, book them.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.320
- [Victor] Danni?

03:41.322 --> 03:42.521
- Yeah?

03:42.523 --> 03:43.455
- [Victor] We'd
like to talk to you

03:43.457 --> 03:44.723
about an exciting opportunity.

03:46.293 --> 03:46.992
- To me?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.863
I'm sorry, what is
this about again?

03:51.865 --> 03:53.865
- [Interviewer] You don't
have to get defensive.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.701
- I'm not.

03:55.703 --> 03:59.371
- [Interviewer] Okay, so did
you try and kill yourself?

03:59.373 --> 04:00.606
- I don't know.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.807
Have you ever tried
to kill yourself?

04:01.809 --> 04:02.708
- Yes.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.810
And then I found Tobin.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.815
- Eight years ago, I was sitting

04:09.817 --> 04:12.251
right where you were sitting.

04:12.253 --> 04:15.687
Back then, the seminar
was all there was.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.923
But today, I'm offering
you a new opportunity.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.760
You are the lucky ones.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.928
You've been chosen.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.367
- So how much does this cost?

04:28.969 --> 04:32.271
- Tobin has waived the fee.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.479
- What's this failure
to comply clause?

04:40.481 --> 04:43.849
- Well if you were
to choose to leave,

04:43.851 --> 04:44.950
well then you would owe the full

04:44.952 --> 04:47.919
cost of the
treatment, the 75,000.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.555
- Okay, so if we
don't wanna stay,

04:50.557 --> 04:52.791
we wanna go, we owe you money?

04:52.793 --> 04:53.625
- Yeah.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.927
(chuckles)

04:57.464 --> 05:01.867
- Okay, well I don't
know that I can do this.

05:01.869 --> 05:02.968
- Oh.

05:02.970 --> 05:07.339
We really thought that you
were ready to say yes to this.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.640
- Of course I am.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.875
- I think you're not.

05:11.378 --> 05:14.413
And deep down, I
think you know it too.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.483
- Okay.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.986
Well congratulations
everybody, I'm...

05:23.424 --> 05:24.756
- [Arthur] You're lucky people.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.629
- So.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.067
Who is ready to say yes

05:36.670 --> 05:37.569
to this?

05:43.944 --> 05:47.679
(dramatic atmosphere music)

06:31.959 --> 06:35.026
- [Victor] Leave
the luggage please.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.030
Follow me up here.

06:41.001 --> 06:41.900
Let's go.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.603
Nice fresh air.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.140
Could you please
line up over here?

06:48.142 --> 06:50.642
Take a picture of you guys.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.658
(peaceful atmosphere music)

07:11.465 --> 07:12.164
- Figures.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.072
- [Victor] Can we have everyone
in the living room please?

07:57.644 --> 08:00.879
- So how do I look?

08:00.881 --> 08:03.815
- Like someone who's
ready to say yes.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.853
(applause)

08:10.524 --> 08:13.792
All right, first thing's first.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.794
I need everyone's cell phones.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.063
You'll get them back at
the end of the retreat.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.499
Cutting off from
the outside world

08:20.501 --> 08:22.267
is essential for
your growth in here.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.626
Beth?

08:48.662 --> 08:49.928
- Oh, I didn't
bring mine with me.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.831
I figured we wouldn't be
able to use them anyway.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.966
- [Victor] That's
very intuitive of you.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.168
- Yeah, I wouldn't
wanna be distracted.

09:02.276 --> 09:04.142
- All right.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.044
Who's ready for stage one?

09:07.281 --> 09:10.949
(tense atmosphere music)

09:36.577 --> 09:38.043
- Come on in.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.244
Please have a seat.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.873
Welcome.

09:51.874 --> 09:54.024
We're about to begin a very
special journey together.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.995
This will be a place where
you can share everything.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.230
Revealing ourselves
to each other

09:59.232 --> 10:01.666
is essential for the
success of this process.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.336
Now none of you are alone.

10:04.338 --> 10:05.870
You're part of a team.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.772
So there can be no distractions.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.040
No mysteries.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.610
So what I'd like
you to do is disrobe

10:11.612 --> 10:13.345
and place all your
clothes to your left

10:13.347 --> 10:15.981
along with all your
preconceived notions.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.182
- Are you serious?

10:17.184 --> 10:19.217
- I know it feels
weird, but we need to

10:19.219 --> 10:20.986
peel away all those
tensions so that

10:20.988 --> 10:23.188
we can expose
ourselves to the most

10:23.190 --> 10:25.056
vulnerable amongst each other.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.894
- I just don't know if
I'm comfortable with this.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.163
- Beth, the point is
to not be comfortable.

10:32.165 --> 10:37.102
- Well I just don't see how
that's supposed to help us.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.107
- Okay, why do you
wear clothes Beth?

10:45.212 --> 10:45.944
- What?

10:45.945 --> 10:46.677
- Why do we wear clothes?

10:49.082 --> 10:49.948
Anyone?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.718
- It's just what you do.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.420
- Okay, but that was
a choice we made.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.989
We decided to wear clothes why?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.290
- Doesn't feel like
much of a choice to me.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.426
- Exactly Danni, we've
become so entrenched

11:01.428 --> 11:03.928
in society that we
don't even realize,

11:03.930 --> 11:06.231
but most of what we
do is compulsion.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.766
But we can still choose.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.669
So why do we wear clothes?

11:10.671 --> 11:12.370
Somebody give me an answer.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.105
- Adam and Eve were
cast out of Eden

11:14.107 --> 11:16.808
and covered themselves
in their shame.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.377
- Yes Matt, shame.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.312
I say what is shame worth?

11:21.314 --> 11:22.947
What do we get from shame?

11:22.949 --> 11:25.216
Shame is a choice that we make.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.852
So tonight let's make
a different choice.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.421
Let's go against shame.

11:29.423 --> 11:33.124
Not to objectify, but to
purify amongst each other.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.160
This is a leap of faith.

11:35.162 --> 11:39.230
Trust me, trust the
process, say yes to this.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.168
- But it's freezing.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.202
- Fucking spare me!

11:45.472 --> 11:47.238
Rebirth is not for
the faint of heart.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.074
Did I choose winners?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.775
Oh shit, did I choose quitters?

11:50.777 --> 11:51.976
Which one did I choose?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.840
The files that
Victor's presenting

12:21.842 --> 12:24.342
to you is everything
we have on you.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.077
Some of which you've given us.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.780
Most of which we've
dug up on our own.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.348
There are no
filters, just facts.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.251
Look around.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.253
For the next few days, these are

12:35.255 --> 12:36.254
your brothers and sisters.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.189
This is your family.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.126
Now you'll read the
file, then introduce

12:41.128 --> 12:42.527
yourself to the group, tell us

12:42.529 --> 12:45.296
what you're here
to do, then cast

12:45.298 --> 12:48.900
yourselves into the
fire to begin anew.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.468
This is stage one.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.441
I'm not gonna call names.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.344
We can sit here all night.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.845
You have to choose this.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.420
(nervous laugh)

13:11.224 --> 13:12.490
- Hi, I'm Danni.

13:14.261 --> 13:19.030
I want to feel like I'm
in control of myself.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.532
- Self-control is
an eternal struggle.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.433
I think we can all relate.

13:22.435 --> 13:26.437
Your focus should be discipline,
values, and self-esteem.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.316
- Hi, I'm John.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.417
- Who?

13:40.253 --> 13:41.319
- I'm John.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.353
- I can't hear you.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.293
- (laughs) I'm John
and I'm very very cold.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.495
(laughter)

13:50.497 --> 13:51.396
- Funny.

13:54.901 --> 13:58.403
- I'm here to learn
how to say yes.

13:58.405 --> 14:02.874
Not just as a slogan,
but as a way of life.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.009
I would like to be less timid.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.344
- Sometimes the way to be less

14:06.346 --> 14:09.113
timid is to not say yes as much.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.049
It's to learn how to say no.

14:11.051 --> 14:11.950
- Okay.

14:13.353 --> 14:18.323
Well then I wanna learn how
to say yes to saying no.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.327
- And that would
help you wouldn't it?

14:22.329 --> 14:24.295
Know when to fold
'em, right John?

14:25.465 --> 14:26.598
- Yeah.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.333
Right.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.951
- [Tobin] That way saying no

14:29.952 --> 14:31.568
protects people,
wouldn't you say?

14:32.439 --> 14:33.538
- I would.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.976
- Balance, judgment,
and thinking of others.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.244
That's your charge.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.979
Now cast your old
self to the fire.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.287
Come on.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.589
Rock paper scissors?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.993
- (sighs) Fuck it.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.266
Hi, my name is Matt.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.967
I love long walks on the
beach, getting caught

15:02.969 --> 15:04.435
in the rain, and
standing naked in front

15:04.437 --> 15:07.171
of strangers whilst
proclaiming my life goals.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.440
- (laughs) Well you
came to the right place.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.645
- I don't really
know why I'm here,

15:13.647 --> 15:16.214
I feel like I just
need to be here.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.048
- Bzzzt!

15:17.050 --> 15:17.949
Try again.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.385
- Nah, I'm serious.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.421
I just, I need to
find out what I need.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.156
I wanna stop being
such a fuckup.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.625
- Amen!

15:27.627 --> 15:30.161
- But Matt, you
served our country.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.398
How can you consider
yourself a fuckup?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.565
- Not if you knew what
happened over there.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.466
- I do.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.468
- No you don't.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.307
- If you're still out there,
we need to bring you home.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.510
Forgiveness, self-worth,
and goal-setting.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.513
Think the fire's getting low.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.520
And then there was one.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.366
- Hi everyone, I'm Beth.

16:10.236 --> 16:13.538
I would like to learn
how to be perfect.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.174
You teach that here?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.042
(chuckles)

16:18.044 --> 16:21.412
- Let me ask you a question
Beth, do you own or lease a car?

16:21.414 --> 16:22.513
- I own one.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.748
- Okay.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.517
But what if I was
to say I'd give you

16:26.519 --> 16:28.419
a brand new car, same
make and model as

16:28.421 --> 16:30.755
the one you have, but
the catch would be

16:30.757 --> 16:32.423
you would have to
give me your old car.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.025
Would you do it?

16:35.428 --> 16:36.260
- No.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.595
- [Tobin] Why not?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.530
- Because I like my car.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.431
- [Tobin] Why?

16:42.369 --> 16:45.436
- It's been a lot
of places with me?

16:45.438 --> 16:48.406
- But I'm sure it
has some problems.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.174
I mean there's gotta be
normal wear and tear.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.677
So the other one would
be in pristine condition.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.613
- Yeah.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.149
- So what we're talking about
actually is peace of mind.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.520
Your old car might
have some problems,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.756
but to you, it isn't broken.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.492
Conversely, the new
one, if I gave it to you

17:07.493 --> 17:09.359
you'd be thinking
about the old one.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.695
So it's actually the new
one that's broken right?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.233
- Okay.

17:15.234 --> 17:19.604
I get it, so you're saying
perfection is subjective.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.538
- No Beth.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.571
That's not what I'm saying.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.108
I'm saying I'm unhappy.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.678
Because I need to
have peace of mind.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.714
I have read all your files.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.450
I know who you are,
who you think you are,

17:32.452 --> 17:35.486
and who you want to be,
and I see four people here,

17:35.488 --> 17:38.389
yet I only have
three cell phones.

17:38.391 --> 17:43.461
So one way or another, I
need to have peace of mind.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.663
And I'm going to get
it if you help me.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.465
Will you help me, Beth?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.399
- I told Victor--

17:48.401 --> 17:50.535
- I know what you told Victor.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.221
Honesty is the first
step towards everything.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.457
Burn the file.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.567
I am not your friend.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.636
I am not here to lie to
you, or to cheerlead you.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.705
I'm here to change you.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.108
I am your guide.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.343
I am your future.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.780
When a broken bone is not
tended to properly it needs

18:35.782 --> 18:38.616
to be rebroken and set in
place in order to heal.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.520
I'm proud of you all
for handling that pain.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.655
Now we have a chance to heal.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.325
You're free to go to your rooms

18:47.327 --> 18:49.227
and get dressed to
your comfort level.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.295
Tomorrow, we begin fresh.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.799
The rest of the
evening is yours.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.811
- Thank god guys, they
brought us some booze.

19:06.813 --> 19:07.912
(chuckles)

19:07.914 --> 19:09.680
- Do we have any bourbon?

19:09.682 --> 19:10.648
- Why yes they do.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.584
Matt, Danni, what can I get you?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.686
I used to be a bartender.

19:15.688 --> 19:16.721
- Just make it two.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.189
- Perfect.

19:18.191 --> 19:22.160
And Matt, I apologize,
I am a lazy bartender.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.662
So you get bourbon as well.

19:33.907 --> 19:34.805
Matty!

19:35.675 --> 19:37.775
(laughs)

19:37.777 --> 19:38.709
Okay.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.646
Cheers?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.614
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:43.616 --> 19:47.285
(tense atmosphere music)

20:24.924 --> 20:26.757
(laughter)

20:26.759 --> 20:29.594
(glass breaks)

20:30.496 --> 20:31.395
- Fuck!

20:31.397 --> 20:32.363
- You're bleeding.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.433
- [John] What?

20:35.435 --> 20:36.500
- You're bleeding!

20:43.943 --> 20:45.376
- I'm gonna go...

20:46.246 --> 20:47.445
I'll go clean it up.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.525
Hi, hi Danni.

21:02.795 --> 21:03.894
- How's the arm?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.430
- Well I'll live.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.299
(chuckles)

21:08.301 --> 21:09.767
- Yeah, well let me take a look.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.436
- See?

21:12.438 --> 21:13.337
No big deal.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.039
- Good.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.946
(tense atmosphere music)

22:32.385 --> 22:34.352
(sobs)

22:36.789 --> 22:38.622
- (gasps) What are you doing?

22:38.624 --> 22:39.890
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

22:39.892 --> 22:40.858
I'm sorry I'm sorry
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.560
- Just get out.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.961
- Listen, listen, you're not
gonna tell anybody right?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.363
- Just get the fuck out!

22:45.365 --> 22:46.897
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.367
(shuddering)

22:50.837 --> 22:51.969
Are you okay?

22:52.805 --> 22:55.005
(sobbing)

22:56.976 --> 22:58.142
I'm sorry, Matt.

22:59.979 --> 23:00.878
Come here.

23:02.849 --> 23:03.748
I'm sorry.

23:05.017 --> 23:05.916
It's okay.

23:08.020 --> 23:08.919
It's okay.

23:10.656 --> 23:11.555
I'm sorry.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.700
(dramatic atmosphere music)

23:29.642 --> 23:32.076
(sharp inhale)

23:32.912 --> 23:34.578
(sharp exhale)

23:34.580 --> 23:35.880
(blender whirring)

23:35.882 --> 23:38.449
(timer beeps)

23:53.699 --> 23:55.966
(knocking)

24:25.031 --> 24:27.898
- Looks like you all got a
little carried away last night.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.433
That's good.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.967
Means you're coming
out of your shells.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.970
That being said, each day
we have to begin anew,

24:32.972 --> 24:35.105
and your physical health is just

24:35.107 --> 24:37.208
as important as
your mental health.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.588
- What's in here?

24:50.590 --> 24:52.223
- Just some help
for your hangover.

24:52.225 --> 24:54.191
Tools to keep you at your peak.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.494
Essential minerals and vitamins.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.195
- That's a miracle.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.800
- Why are all ours different?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.970
- (laughs) The question man.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.441
I can respect that.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.676
- Different age, build,
gender, and race.

25:12.678 --> 25:15.646
These have been carefully
calculated to fit you perfectly.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.623
- I think I'm just gonna
hold onto mine for now.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.957
- I think you should take them.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.669
I think you should take them.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.212
My mentor's name was a
guy named Angelo Derose.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.082
Who created the Derose
Foundation in 1964.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.150
You might've heard of him.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.186
Passed away about 10 years ago.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.627
When I first started working
for the organization,

26:04.597 --> 26:06.564
I rose up the ranks quickly.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.100
I was assigned to
be an evaluator.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.119
For big people.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.137
Powerful businessmen,
politicians, A-list celebrities.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.906
A lot of them are
still my friends, yeah.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.276
I used the same principles
that I use today.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.114
That are made to shift
you from your paradigm.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.985
And get your mind not
focused on your problems.

26:29.989 --> 26:33.123
So let's just say a
high-powered businesswoman

26:33.125 --> 26:35.593
would come in, and
I'd say sit down,

26:35.595 --> 26:37.127
tell me about your problems.

26:37.129 --> 26:40.164
And she'd start rattling
them off, you know?

26:40.166 --> 26:43.167
My husband hates me,
I don't like my job.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.070
You'd see her actually shrink
in the chair, posture down.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.773
And right in the
middle of it I'd have

26:49.775 --> 26:52.009
this glass of
water on the table.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.978
Right as she's talking,
getting really emotional,

26:53.980 --> 26:56.146
I take the glass of water, I
throw it right in her face.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.115
And she'd freak out.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.617
What the hell did
you do that for?

26:59.619 --> 27:00.851
What are you doing?

27:03.089 --> 27:03.938
I'd say calm down,
sit down, sit down.

27:03.939 --> 27:04.788
She'd sit back down,
I'd say all right,

27:04.790 --> 27:05.656
tell me more about
your problems.

27:05.658 --> 27:06.690
I can't!

27:06.692 --> 27:08.225
I can't even focus.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.195
And then it would click.

27:11.197 --> 27:12.296
I'd see it click.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.133
She had this other emotion now.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.768
Anger.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.937
And she couldn't focus
on her problems anymore.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.206
We choose what we
want to focus on.

27:23.776 --> 27:27.144
Last night, folks, was the
glass of water in the face.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.280
I felt bad about doing
it, but it had to be done.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.316
Now we can move on.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.119
Let's walk.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.187
- What's in there?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.223
- Stage two.

27:40.326 --> 27:44.028
(tense atmosphere music)

28:16.228 --> 28:19.329
- Hey Tobin, I think
Matt needs a minute.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.231
- [Tobin] He'll be
fine, Matt's a fighter.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.132
He'll catch up.

28:33.713 --> 28:34.712
- Hey.

28:34.714 --> 28:35.846
Are you okay?

28:39.418 --> 28:41.852
You still got those pills?

28:43.389 --> 28:45.089
Look, I'm not gonna
tell you what to do

28:45.091 --> 28:47.057
or anything, but I
think they're good.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.160
- I've had to take
things and they didn't

28:50.162 --> 28:52.996
always work like they
were supposed to.

28:52.998 --> 28:54.431
- I get that.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.301
But I actually think Tobin
knows what he's doing.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.805
- You sure about that?

29:01.807 --> 29:04.341
- I haven't been sure of
anything in a long time.

29:17.456 --> 29:21.391
(dramatic atmosphere music)

29:51.423 --> 29:53.123
- [John] How are you feeling?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.392
- Surprisingly not that bad.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.495
I gotta get Victor's recipe.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.396
- Right?

30:01.133 --> 30:02.032
So...

30:03.803 --> 30:05.402
Do you remember
much of last night?

30:08.374 --> 30:11.108
- Honestly, it's
all a bit blurry.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.410
What about you?

30:17.316 --> 30:18.249
- Yeah.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.183
Yeah, I don't remember anything.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.261
- Feeling better?

30:31.263 --> 30:32.129
- Yeah.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.466
What happened last night?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.536
- I guess a lot
of decompressing.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.975
- Well I'm not judging, so.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.176
- What do you mean?

30:47.313 --> 30:49.346
- You know, you and John.

30:50.983 --> 30:51.949
- What if we did?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.150
Would that make you jealous?

30:55.387 --> 30:56.253
- No.

30:57.423 --> 30:58.555
- You sure about that?

31:00.059 --> 31:00.958
- Trust me.

31:04.496 --> 31:07.464
- 'Cause I saw you looking
at me when we had to strip.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.038
- Is sex your thing?

31:15.040 --> 31:15.973
Is that why you're here?

31:15.975 --> 31:17.174
- Are you calling me a slut?

31:20.546 --> 31:21.946
- No.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.347
No, I'm just, you
know, just thinking

31:23.349 --> 31:25.515
about the files from
last night, you know?

31:31.557 --> 31:33.156
Hey look, I'm sorry.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.591
I shouldn't have said anything.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.396
Really, I'm sorry, all right?

31:50.409 --> 31:51.675
- Yeah.

31:51.677 --> 31:52.509
Okay?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.244
That's why I'm here.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.614
I just can't control it and
it scares the hell out of me.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.451
I don't know what else
to do about it, you know?

32:03.022 --> 32:05.355
- I mean I'm sorry, it's not
really any of my business.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.457
- It's fine.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.376
What is it Tobin said?

32:09.377 --> 32:11.294
I guess we're all
brothers and sisters now.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.963
(chuckles)

32:12.965 --> 32:13.697
What?

32:13.699 --> 32:15.532
What's so funny?

32:15.534 --> 32:17.701
- You had sex with your
brother last night.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.103
- Oh, I guess I did didn't I?

32:20.105 --> 32:22.439
(laughs)

32:22.441 --> 32:23.473
- Oh man.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.946
- What are they laughing at?

32:28.948 --> 32:29.646
- I don't know.

32:35.988 --> 32:36.687
- What's wrong?

32:39.658 --> 32:41.224
- I don't know about this.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.530
I feel like it's bringing
out the worst in me.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.334
- What'd you do
that was so wrong?

32:54.106 --> 32:56.039
- Why do you think
Tobin chose us?

32:56.041 --> 32:57.708
- Isn't it obvious?

32:57.710 --> 32:58.542
- No.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.411
Not to me.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.480
(distant laughing)

33:03.482 --> 33:05.248
What the fuck at
they laughing at?

33:06.352 --> 33:08.418
(sighs)

33:09.588 --> 33:13.256
(tense atmosphere music)

33:18.330 --> 33:19.463
- Life.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.231
Death.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.133
Winning, losing.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.435
What do these things
have in common?

33:25.437 --> 33:27.204
Risk, they all involve risk.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.705
Say yes to this.

33:28.707 --> 33:29.606
- [Group] Yes.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.429
- There will be sacrifices.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.746
What are you willing
to sacrifice if you
want it bad enough?

33:38.083 --> 33:41.451
In the face of danger,
what are you made of?

33:41.453 --> 33:43.053
- Wait, what's going on?

33:43.055 --> 33:45.255
- You don't believe
in training wheels.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.623
These pistols are loaded.

33:46.625 --> 33:47.591
(gunshot)

33:47.593 --> 33:49.126
- Jesus!

33:49.128 --> 33:52.429
- No Beth, this has nothing
to do with the divine.

33:52.431 --> 33:55.332
This has to do with
right here, right now.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.568
What kind of fear
do you possess?

34:00.506 --> 34:03.507
Every day, we walk out
our doors, we face fear.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.277
(nervous laugh)

34:08.280 --> 34:10.112
- All right, okay.

34:10.114 --> 34:14.717
- Criminals, diseases,
natural disasters.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.152
Any one of those things could

34:16.155 --> 34:17.587
wipe us off the
face of the Earth.

34:18.556 --> 34:22.492
So why is it that when
someone we've entrusted

34:22.494 --> 34:25.695
our souls to has a gun,
we're so terrified?

34:25.697 --> 34:28.665
- Please, he can't...

34:28.667 --> 34:29.565
- Huh?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.603
Maybe, maybe it's
because we live

34:33.605 --> 34:35.672
with fear every day and
we've become so numb

34:35.674 --> 34:39.076
to it that we don't
even realize it exists?

34:39.078 --> 34:40.444
- Please!
- Maybe.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.511
- Don't pick on him.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.550
- Good.

34:49.822 --> 34:50.719
It's okay, buddy.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.764
Stage two is about evaluation.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.170
We need to find where
the fear exists.

35:12.544 --> 35:13.427
Take it!

35:13.428 --> 35:14.311
And what we can learn from it.

35:20.519 --> 35:21.751
You must work together.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.489
Danni must get to
the end of the path.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.459
And you three must
hit those targets.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.863
The exercises will
continue until

35:32.865 --> 35:34.564
we learn what we need to learn.

35:34.566 --> 35:38.668
You three fear the gun,
so now you have the guns.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.537
Danni here trusts me.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.606
She trusts the process,
but she can't trust others,

35:42.608 --> 35:46.376
so her life is
now in your hands.

35:51.183 --> 35:54.684
(tense atmosphere music)

36:37.229 --> 36:39.462
(gunshot)

36:43.402 --> 36:44.868
You ever fire a gun before John?

36:46.838 --> 36:47.737
- No.

36:50.475 --> 36:51.374
- Try again.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.847
(gunshot)

36:57.849 --> 36:59.216
There you go!

36:59.218 --> 37:00.650
Damn, just like a pro!

37:00.652 --> 37:02.219
All right.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.529
(flashback gunfire)

37:16.768 --> 37:18.702
(gunshot)

37:18.704 --> 37:19.803
Great job, soldier.

37:19.805 --> 37:23.873
Man, it's just like you're
back out there in the desert.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.243
Fantastic.

37:29.414 --> 37:30.981
You're doing great, Danni.

37:30.983 --> 37:31.915
Stay strong.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.733
(gunshot)

37:49.735 --> 37:51.001
Try again Beth.

37:51.003 --> 37:52.702
- I know what I'm doing,
I've shot a gun before.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.437
- Oh bullshit.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.372
You gonna lie to me, you'll be

37:55.374 --> 37:56.873
the next one out on the range.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.508
Now do you wanna shoot or do
you wanna make up a story?

37:58.510 --> 37:59.376
- I wanna shoot.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.813
(gunshot)

38:03.815 --> 38:05.048
- [Tobin] Whoa there, Beth.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.517
- You're almost there.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.852
You can do this.

38:08.854 --> 38:09.853
- I got it.

38:12.024 --> 38:13.790
- You don't wanna quit do you?

38:16.295 --> 38:16.993
- No.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.401
(gunshot)

38:25.504 --> 38:27.337
- What the hell
are you doing huh?

38:27.339 --> 38:29.906
- I didn't, that's not
where I was aiming!

38:29.908 --> 38:31.908
- You nearly fucking killed her!

38:31.910 --> 38:32.876
- Matt, lay off.

38:32.878 --> 38:33.710
- Or what John?

38:33.712 --> 38:34.911
Or what?

38:34.913 --> 38:36.579
She did that on purpose
and it's not funny!

38:37.616 --> 38:38.748
Why'd you do that?

38:38.750 --> 38:39.749
- Matt!

38:39.750 --> 38:40.749
- You want all the
attention, is that it?

38:40.752 --> 38:41.651
Is that it Beth?

38:42.454 --> 38:43.620
Is that what you want?

38:43.622 --> 38:44.521
- Matt.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.057
- Guys stop, John!

38:47.059 --> 38:47.891
John!

38:47.893 --> 38:48.858
Stop!

38:48.860 --> 38:51.394
(gunshots)

38:56.902 --> 38:59.436
- Now what did we learn today?

39:07.612 --> 39:11.348
(dramatic atmosphere music)

39:17.522 --> 39:20.090
- [Tobin Echo] Maybe,
maybe it's because we live

39:20.092 --> 39:22.659
with fear every day and
we've become so numb

39:22.661 --> 39:26.096
to it that we don't
even realize it exists.

39:31.636 --> 39:34.371
(gunshot echos)

39:45.951 --> 39:49.686
(dramatic atmosphere music)

40:05.537 --> 40:07.771
(moaning)

40:16.948 --> 40:20.049
(camera clicking)

40:56.154 --> 40:59.055
(wood creaking)

41:14.873 --> 41:16.973
(camera whirs)

41:16.975 --> 41:19.075
(knocking)

41:28.854 --> 41:30.954
- [Victor] Report to
the treatment center.

41:30.956 --> 41:32.255
- Right now?

41:32.257 --> 41:33.890
But there was nothing
on the schedule.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.059
- [Victor] Life doesn't
wait for your schedule.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.894
It's time for stage three.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.145
- I can feel your
apprehension right now.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.014
And that's great.

41:58.016 --> 41:58.848
You're raw.

41:59.818 --> 42:00.984
This is the fire.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.654
Say yes and it
will galvanize you.

42:04.656 --> 42:06.589
- We're ready, Jefe.

42:06.591 --> 42:09.058
- Stage three requires
your utmost honesty.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.795
This is a lie detector.

42:12.797 --> 42:13.997
And each of you will
be connected to it.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.298
- Wait a second, you can't--

42:15.300 --> 42:17.734
- I understand your fears.

42:17.736 --> 42:18.968
But trust me, this will be the

42:18.970 --> 42:20.937
greatest thing you
have ever done.

42:22.741 --> 42:25.174
Beth, you're worthy.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.710
You're worthy of attention.

42:27.712 --> 42:28.878
Of friendship.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.812
Of love.

42:29.814 --> 42:31.915
Not the you that you present.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.550
The real one that's inside.

42:33.552 --> 42:34.751
And we are gonna bring that out.

42:39.024 --> 42:40.990
This is the hot seat.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.259
Each of you will have
a chance to sit in it.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.228
Now while you're in
the seat, you will

42:45.230 --> 42:48.731
answer every question
asked by your peers.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.266
Now you can answer any
way you choose, but if you

42:50.268 --> 42:53.836
choose the path of
dishonesty, we'll all know it.

42:54.706 --> 42:56.072
Let's begin shall we?

42:57.642 --> 42:59.075
Care to guess who goes first?

43:09.120 --> 43:11.154
- So what do I ask her?

43:12.290 --> 43:13.690
- Anything you want.

43:13.692 --> 43:15.091
She's an opened book
for you to read.

43:17.295 --> 43:18.194
- Okay.

43:19.798 --> 43:21.764
(clears throat)

43:21.766 --> 43:25.068
(nervous laugh)

43:25.070 --> 43:26.169
Hi.

43:27.038 --> 43:30.173
- (chuckles) Hi.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.143
- Are you nervous?

43:35.113 --> 43:36.112
- Mmm-mm, no.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.115
(detector buzzes)

43:39.117 --> 43:40.216
It's okay.

43:43.154 --> 43:44.187
I'm nervous too.

43:50.261 --> 43:53.162
So where you from?

43:53.164 --> 43:54.998
- New York.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.399
(detector buzzes)

43:56.401 --> 43:57.266
- Okay.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.273
Are you a woman?

44:05.410 --> 44:06.376
- Yes John.

44:09.781 --> 44:10.680
- Okay.

44:13.184 --> 44:14.150
Do you sleep at night?

44:17.088 --> 44:18.254
- [Beth] Most of the time.

44:21.393 --> 44:23.092
- Are you a vegetarian?

44:23.094 --> 44:24.227
- [Beth] Yeah, I am.

44:24.229 --> 44:27.330
(detector buzzes)

44:32.170 --> 44:33.836
- Why would you lie about that?

44:33.838 --> 44:34.671
- I'm not.

44:34.673 --> 44:37.373
(detector buzzes)

44:39.210 --> 44:41.978
- I don't care what you eat.

44:43.281 --> 44:45.248
I'm just, I'm asking you these

44:45.250 --> 44:46.249
questions because I have to.

44:46.251 --> 44:47.250
- Yeah, I know that.

44:47.252 --> 44:48.751
- Okay, so why would you lie?

44:48.753 --> 44:49.385
- I'm not!

44:49.387 --> 44:50.753
I'm not lying!

44:50.755 --> 44:52.121
(detector buzzes)

44:52.123 --> 44:53.022
- See?

44:54.292 --> 44:55.258
What the fuck?

44:58.930 --> 45:02.398
I'm trying to be really
nice here and you're just...

45:03.802 --> 45:05.234
Being rude.

45:05.236 --> 45:07.270
- How long does
this have to go on?

45:07.272 --> 45:08.855
- We'll know when
it's time to stop.

45:08.856 --> 45:10.439
- Okay, I want it to be
time to stop right now!

45:10.442 --> 45:13.109
- That's the first thing
you've said that's true.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.244
So you're here for lying.

45:15.246 --> 45:16.079
- What?

45:16.081 --> 45:16.913
No I am not!

45:16.915 --> 45:18.181
(detector buzzes)

45:18.183 --> 45:20.216
Guys, seriously, help me
get out of this please!

45:20.218 --> 45:21.050
- Why do you lie?

45:21.052 --> 45:22.251
- I don't lie!

45:22.253 --> 45:23.864
(detector buzzes)

45:23.865 --> 45:25.476
- Is it even a choice
or is it a compulsion?

45:25.477 --> 45:27.088
- I don't know what
you are talking about.

45:27.092 --> 45:27.924
(detector buzzes)

45:27.926 --> 45:29.158
Please just help me.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.827
- Don't even think
about it cowboy.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.100
- It's despicable.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.503
You do it because you
think people will like you?

45:40.505 --> 45:42.171
- Fuck you.

45:42.173 --> 45:43.339
- How are they gonna like you

45:43.341 --> 45:44.807
if they don't know who you are?

45:44.809 --> 45:45.441
- Stop it!

45:45.443 --> 45:46.342
- If you're afraid.

45:47.345 --> 45:50.079
Of the person that you are.

45:50.081 --> 45:51.280
- Just help me.

46:02.227 --> 46:04.327
- Did you put us
together on purpose?

46:06.064 --> 46:08.030
- Everything we do
here is on purpose.

46:18.777 --> 46:20.376
- I thinK I know
why you lie Beth.

46:20.378 --> 46:21.277
- I...

46:21.279 --> 46:22.178
- See this?

46:25.250 --> 46:26.149
I'm not married.

46:27.318 --> 46:28.351
I mean I was.

46:30.155 --> 46:31.154
We're divorced now.

46:35.960 --> 46:40.296
That was the first time
I've said that out loud.

46:40.298 --> 46:45.134
If I take it off, it means
I'm admitting that...

46:49.541 --> 46:51.274
I was such a pathetic husband

46:51.276 --> 46:54.076
that my wife abandoned our vows.

46:56.314 --> 46:59.482
That being with me one more day

47:00.985 --> 47:02.118
was not worth living.

47:05.490 --> 47:06.956
- Why did she leave you?

47:09.327 --> 47:11.260
- It's this gambling.

47:13.464 --> 47:15.865
- But it's not the
gambling is it?

47:18.469 --> 47:20.269
Is it?

47:20.271 --> 47:21.137
- It is.

47:21.139 --> 47:22.371
- Bullshit!

47:22.373 --> 47:24.006
Don't you stop now when
you are so close John.

47:27.178 --> 47:30.079
- When I was a kid, I
had a lot of energy.

47:35.420 --> 47:37.954
People didn't know
how to handle it.

47:37.956 --> 47:38.988
I'd get in trouble.

47:40.058 --> 47:42.225
My mom didn't like that so much.

47:42.227 --> 47:44.260
The first time I did anything,

47:44.262 --> 47:46.996
she put me in the
closet for an hour.

47:48.933 --> 47:50.933
That was every day.

47:52.036 --> 47:54.237
Just to remind me
that I was a bad kid.

47:56.341 --> 48:01.110
One day I was pushed in
line for lunch by this kid.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.248
And I beat him so bad he
had to go to the hospital.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.152
I spent a week in the closet.

48:13.424 --> 48:14.991
When the doors finally opened,

48:17.462 --> 48:19.562
I heard two men
from Child Services.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
The next place wasn't
that much better.

48:26.437 --> 48:27.570
- You're an animal, John.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.073
You're an animal.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.341
Do you understand that?

48:32.343 --> 48:35.411
And you've been locked
in a cage for so long.

48:36.648 --> 48:38.381
It's time to get out.

48:38.383 --> 48:41.517
It's time to let that animal
out of the cage and go free.

48:41.519 --> 48:45.187
(tense atmosphere music)

48:58.136 --> 48:59.268
- Why do you lie Beth?

49:02.040 --> 49:02.939
Why?

49:11.082 --> 49:13.482
- Because you can't tell
people your secrets.

49:13.484 --> 49:14.383
- Why not?

49:16.354 --> 49:18.120
- Because they'll
stop loving you.

49:28.566 --> 49:29.498
- You can talk to us.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.271
- He never loved me.

49:35.272 --> 49:37.072
He never even knew
that I existed.

49:37.075 --> 49:38.307
- Your father?

49:38.309 --> 49:41.444
- He didn't give a shit
until I started lying.

49:41.446 --> 49:43.746
- And that fixed
everything didn't it?

49:43.748 --> 49:45.114
But it didn't fix you.

49:46.451 --> 49:48.617
You needed to be loved
by others, so you figured

49:48.619 --> 49:50.519
the only way you could
do that was to...

49:50.521 --> 49:51.554
- Lie.

49:51.556 --> 49:52.455
- About what?

49:56.594 --> 49:58.594
- He was cute and I liked him.

50:01.265 --> 50:02.732
He was nice to me.

50:02.734 --> 50:04.300
He was really sweet to me.

50:06.037 --> 50:06.736
- [Tobin] And?

50:08.506 --> 50:12.375
- I invited him over
one day after school.

50:17.248 --> 50:19.315
And then daddy
walked in the door.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.187
And he just looked
so disappointed.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.422
So I screamed.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.625
I just screamed.

50:29.627 --> 50:32.061
- And what did you scream?

50:38.569 --> 50:39.435
- Rape.

50:41.672 --> 50:42.671
He's raping me.

50:43.808 --> 50:44.740
- Where is he now?

50:46.110 --> 50:46.776
- I don't know.

50:48.046 --> 50:50.713
(detector buzzes)

50:52.083 --> 50:53.082
He's in jail.

50:59.757 --> 51:02.291
- Are you jealous of Danni?

51:04.328 --> 51:05.661
- Yeah.

51:05.663 --> 51:06.562
- Why?

51:09.267 --> 51:12.368
- Because getting attention
is just so easy for her.

51:13.538 --> 51:15.504
- Life is not
always how it seems.

51:16.607 --> 51:19.141
- When we had the pistols,
did you aim at her?

51:22.180 --> 51:23.646
- (clears throat) I did.

51:24.682 --> 51:27.149
But it was just for a second.

51:27.151 --> 51:28.584
I just wanted to
see what it felt

51:28.586 --> 51:30.219
like to have that kind of power,

51:30.221 --> 51:32.555
but I aimed away, I
didn't pull the trigger.

51:32.557 --> 51:33.556
- You swear?

51:33.558 --> 51:34.457
- I swear.

51:37.462 --> 51:38.727
- And now it's time to stop.

51:49.540 --> 51:50.606
- Matt, you're up!

51:51.609 --> 51:53.209
Report to the chair soldier.

51:53.211 --> 51:54.477
That's an order.

51:54.479 --> 51:56.645
- I think I'm gonna
sit this one out.

51:56.647 --> 51:59.248
- Did you forget you
signed a contract, Matt?

51:59.250 --> 52:00.182
- Pretty sure it doesn't mean

52:00.184 --> 52:01.350
I have to do what you say.

52:01.352 --> 52:02.451
- Oh you sure
about that private?

52:02.453 --> 52:03.385
- Stop that.

52:03.387 --> 52:04.587
- What's with the resistance?

52:04.589 --> 52:06.622
Why are you scared
to get better?

52:06.624 --> 52:08.157
- I'm not.

52:08.158 --> 52:09.691
- Great, okay then, sit
in the chair recruit.

52:10.728 --> 52:11.627
- Make me.

52:14.398 --> 52:16.599
- You know I'm already
in your head don't you?

52:16.601 --> 52:17.867
- Fuck you.

52:17.869 --> 52:19.368
We're not your toys.

52:19.370 --> 52:21.637
We're human beings,
this is fucked up.

52:21.639 --> 52:22.671
- Why?

52:22.673 --> 52:24.540
- Are you serious?

52:24.542 --> 52:26.475
You're torturing
this poor woman.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.310
Humiliating her with
her worst nightmare.

52:28.312 --> 52:29.912
- Facing your fears is the
only way to overcome them.

52:29.914 --> 52:31.847
- What about the guns huh?

52:31.849 --> 52:33.916
You put Danni out there
in front of live firearms.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.351
- No Matt, it's
okay, it wasn't real.

52:35.353 --> 52:36.418
The guns weren't loaded.

52:36.420 --> 52:37.253
- No.

52:37.255 --> 52:39.388
Beth's wasn't, mine was.

52:39.390 --> 52:41.257
I know what a bullet feels
like when it leaves a gun.

52:41.259 --> 52:43.192
I watched it fly.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.561
I know what I felt
and I know what I saw.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.663
- I repeat, facing your fears

52:47.665 --> 52:49.398
is the only way
to overcome them.

52:50.935 --> 52:51.834
- I'm done with this bullshit.

52:51.836 --> 52:52.701
- No.

52:54.238 --> 52:55.871
What are you running from huh?

52:55.873 --> 52:58.440
How many people did
you kill over there?

52:58.442 --> 52:59.575
It was your job.

52:59.577 --> 53:00.743
Why do you blame yourself?

53:01.746 --> 53:03.345
Wait, I am not
through with you yet!

53:03.347 --> 53:04.246
Matt!

53:06.717 --> 53:07.650
(door slams)

53:07.652 --> 53:08.751
Fuck!

53:13.524 --> 53:15.724
Good work everyone,
we're done for tonight.

53:20.198 --> 53:21.697
- [Danni] What the
hell's this Victor?

53:21.699 --> 53:24.700
- Every problem requires
a unique solution.

53:24.702 --> 53:26.502
And Tobin's the master.

53:26.504 --> 53:28.704
- But what do you
think is happening?

53:28.706 --> 53:30.056
- I don't know.

53:30.057 --> 53:31.407
I've never seen
him act like this.

53:32.710 --> 53:33.776
Let me go talk to him.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.712
I'm sure he knows
what he's doing.

53:41.819 --> 53:45.487
- You guys, there's
something really wrong here.

53:45.489 --> 53:46.956
- Okay, well should
we go look for Matt?

53:46.958 --> 53:48.657
- No.

53:48.659 --> 53:50.426
Give him some space.

53:50.428 --> 53:51.760
- I can't do this.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.262
- Come on.

53:53.264 --> 53:54.697
You knew what this was.

53:54.699 --> 53:55.731
You knew it was out of the box

53:55.733 --> 53:57.766
and you knew it would get real.

53:57.768 --> 53:58.834
Shit just got real.

53:59.704 --> 54:01.804
I gotta say it feels good.

54:01.806 --> 54:02.638
- [Danni] What?

54:02.640 --> 54:04.240
Are you kidding me?

54:04.242 --> 54:05.808
You're buying into it?

54:05.810 --> 54:06.875
- [John] You're not?

54:08.813 --> 54:10.846
- This is bullshit.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.554
- Honestly John, this feels
really good to me too.

54:20.758 --> 54:22.625
- Yes.

54:22.627 --> 54:23.792
Yes it does.

54:23.794 --> 54:26.729
(nervous laugh)

54:28.466 --> 54:31.934
(tense atmosphere music)

55:03.501 --> 55:05.000
- Good morning everyone.

55:05.002 --> 55:06.702
- Where's Tobin?

55:06.704 --> 55:08.704
- He got an early start.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.706
He's gonna meet us out there.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.875
Daily supplements for you.

55:12.877 --> 55:15.411
- (laughs) After last
night we don't need a drop.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.346
- A drop?

55:17.348 --> 55:18.314
- Of alcohol?

55:18.316 --> 55:19.748
Aren't those for hangovers?

55:20.785 --> 55:22.918
- I make a new batch every day.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.587
We want you at your best selves.

55:27.558 --> 55:28.857
- Hey guys.

55:28.859 --> 55:30.025
Really excited to be here.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.063
Arthur, from seminar?

55:34.065 --> 55:35.597
- Yeah, yeah.

55:36.901 --> 55:38.967
Sorry, I just didn't
expect to see anybody new.

55:40.338 --> 55:41.036
- Bottoms up.

55:52.416 --> 55:55.951
(dramatic atmosphere music)

56:11.802 --> 56:14.703
So has it just been
an amazing weekend?

56:14.705 --> 56:16.372
Getting to know Tobin?

56:16.374 --> 56:18.407
Did you feel changed at all?

56:18.409 --> 56:21.143
- Do you think this means
Matt's not coming back?

56:21.145 --> 56:23.145
- You think they even
know where he is?

56:24.715 --> 56:25.948
- I mean it's just
been awesome right?

56:25.950 --> 56:26.815
- I don't know.

56:26.817 --> 56:29.718
(coughs)

56:29.720 --> 56:31.420
- Are you okay?

56:31.422 --> 56:32.621
- Yeah, I'm fine.

56:38.129 --> 56:40.162
- You guys should
see yourselves.

56:40.164 --> 56:41.864
You look crazy.

56:41.866 --> 56:44.066
(laughs)

56:44.068 --> 56:45.834
When life presents
you with a demon

56:45.836 --> 56:48.771
you have two choices,
you can kill it

56:48.773 --> 56:52.074
or you can join it, but
when the demon is inside

56:52.076 --> 56:55.677
of you, you have to
bend it to your will.

56:55.679 --> 56:56.779
(coughs)

56:56.781 --> 56:58.080
It's still a demon.

56:59.183 --> 57:00.449
But it's your demon.

57:02.153 --> 57:03.685
You're a beautiful demon.

57:05.923 --> 57:08.957
I give life, I save life.

57:08.959 --> 57:12.928
So in turn, I must take it away.

57:12.930 --> 57:16.498
(distorted audio effects)

57:28.946 --> 57:30.979
You can't choose your demons.

57:30.981 --> 57:32.648
It's random, life is random.

57:34.018 --> 57:35.918
So when a demon presents itself,

57:37.054 --> 57:39.054
it's the luck of the draw.

57:39.056 --> 57:41.023
This morning a demon
came to our camp.

57:42.126 --> 57:45.494
It came in disguise
in the form of a pill.

57:45.496 --> 57:46.762
(violent coughing)

57:46.764 --> 57:48.897
(demonic voice) And now.

57:48.899 --> 57:50.666
You can choose to
let it destroy you,

57:50.668 --> 57:53.001
or you can purge it and
you can get stronger.

57:53.003 --> 57:53.969
Do you understand?

57:55.105 --> 57:56.705
Banish the demon Danni!

57:56.707 --> 57:58.841
(vomits)

58:09.987 --> 58:10.853
Good girl.

58:17.828 --> 58:19.728
Trust is a currency.

58:19.730 --> 58:21.897
It is not blind obedience.

58:21.899 --> 58:24.066
It does not overrule precaution.

58:24.068 --> 58:26.168
That is the lesson for today.

58:26.170 --> 58:28.070
Level four is about reflection.

58:29.573 --> 58:31.106
So please return
to the treatment

58:31.108 --> 58:32.908
center for your next exercise.

58:45.723 --> 58:48.056
(wind howls)

58:48.058 --> 58:51.760
(tense atmosphere music)

59:36.807 --> 59:38.140
- Hey, are you okay?

59:39.343 --> 59:41.009
- Yeah.

59:41.011 --> 59:42.077
I'm fine.

59:43.781 --> 59:44.680
- I'm sorry.

59:46.083 --> 59:49.751
- So Arthur, are you staying
in the nuthouse with us?

59:49.753 --> 59:51.720
Probably taking
Matt's room right?

59:51.722 --> 59:56.358
- (laughs) No, I'm staying
at the treatment lodge.

59:56.360 --> 59:58.927
It's the price you pay
for late arrival right?

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:02.164
So how's the retreat going?

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:05.867
- Hard to say.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:06.768
Intense.

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:08.971
For sure.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:09.871
Beth?

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:19.047
- Yeah, I think it's
kinda hard to explain.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:20.015
- Could you try?

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:28.123
- Well we've covered a lot
of ground really quickly.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:32.361
- Hmmm.

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:35.330
Are you healed?

01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:39.234
- Yeah, I think
I'm getting there.

01:00:43.374 --> 01:00:44.773
- That's good.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.277
And how about you Danni?

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.283
- I'm sorry, how do
you know my name?

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:58.320
- Oh, well Tobin said it.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.222
- Oh.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.324
Yeah, maybe.

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:04.159
I guess I was pretty out of it.

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:06.294
- Do you believe in Tobin?

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:15.003
- Maybe ask her after she
hasn't just thrown up, man.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.708
- I'm sorry, I'm just
really exhilarated

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.277
that you were chosen
by fate to take

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:26.682
a step forward today, and
I just wish it was me.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:31.053
- From my side, it doesn't
seem so exhilarating.

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:32.788
- But you changed today.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.990
- I was poisoned, okay?

01:01:36.093 --> 01:01:39.995
That's not progress,
that's just fucked up.

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:45.267
Matt!

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:47.002
- Hey.

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:48.837
- Hey, I'm Arthur.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:51.773
- Yeah, the guy from
the seminar, yeah.

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:52.908
- Where have you been?

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:56.778
- I'll tell you over a drink
'cause I could sure use one.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.049
I ran for what felt like hours.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:04.352
I tell you, we're out here guys.

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:09.124
There's nothing but
woods for miles.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.028
And the further I
got, I just kept

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:16.164
thinking back about
you guys, you know?

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:18.166
If something had
happened to you...

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:22.237
It reminded me of
a familiar place.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.374
A place that I did
not wanna go back to.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.211
I'm not that guy anymore.

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:33.381
I just knew I had to
get back to y'all.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.951
- I thought we were never
gonna see you again.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.887
I'm happy you came back.

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:39.888
I think we all are.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:43.792
- Me too.

01:02:45.162 --> 01:02:48.930
But look, we need
to go to Tobin,

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.368
and we gotta tell him
enough is enough okay?

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.436
We're done with this.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.304
- Are you sure about that?

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:57.372
- You're not?

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:00.275
- I'm not.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:04.146
Tobin's made a lot of
really good points.

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:07.382
- Jesus, Danni, are you
the only sane one left?

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:08.283
- Yeah.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.554
- Guys, something's
wrong here right?

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:14.356
- What do you mean?

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:16.525
- Listen, it's
nothing personal man,

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:18.093
but I don't know
you and you haven't

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:20.395
been around long
enough to understand.

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:22.230
In fact I feel sorry for you.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:23.431
- What are you trying to say?

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:26.468
That Tobin's actually
trying to hurt us?

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:28.870
I mean you can't mean that.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.274
- Is this what you expected?

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:35.343
I mean we've all been to his
events, we've read his books.

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:38.246
I mean how much more
is he gonna push this?

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:40.515
He put a live gun in my hands.

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:42.150
How much further is he gonna go?

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:45.420
- I mean he said this
was a new program, so.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.559
- What is the one thing
that we have all in common?

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:58.066
- None of us have people
who would miss us.

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:01.536
Yeah, I thought about that too.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:09.044
- We all just have
to be careful, okay?

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:21.289
(tense atmosphere music)

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:34.169
(knocking)

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:35.003
- Hey.

01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:35.637
- What's up?

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:36.938
- Take a walk with me.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.606
- Okay.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.614
Is this about the other night?

01:04:45.616 --> 01:04:46.882
- What?

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.416
Oh.

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:49.985
- Because I've been meaning
to tell you that I am sorry.

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:52.921
That is not who I
wanna be anymore.

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:54.189
- No, you don't
need to say sorry.

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:56.524
I completely understand,
that's not you.

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:00.262
- Thank you.

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:01.563
That means a lot.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:05.367
So why are we here?

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:07.669
- Arthur.

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:09.471
- Yeah.

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:14.442
(tense atmosphere music)

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:01.222
- [Arthur] They're
getting close.

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:03.692
- Then it is time for you
to prove your commitment.

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:10.131
- [Arthur] Whatever you require.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.032
- Good.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:16.404
Soon your pain's gonna
go away, my friend.

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:17.672
- [Arthur] Yes.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:18.640
Thank you, Victor.

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:22.243
- [Victor] Is there
anything else to report?

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:25.580
- [Arthur] Well Matt is back.

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:28.550
He's creating dissent

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:30.518
among the group.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.153
He's making them question Tobin.

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.723
- Hang in there.

01:06:34.725 --> 01:06:35.690
And stay focused.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.493
We're keeping an eye on Matt.

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:46.501
- Couldn't wait for the
next stage could you?

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.603
(suspenseful atmosphere music)

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.305
Could you?

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:52.006
You made some really good
progress, but I think

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:54.142
it's time we skipped
ahead a few steps.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:54.776
Don't you?

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:56.478
- You're hurting me!

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.481
- Oh come on, I thought
you were the tough one.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:00.715
- [Danni] Ow!

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:11.393
- Now you're ready for the
final stage of transformation.

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:15.330
(music intensifies)

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:25.740
(gasps)

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.745
- [Matt] Danni, you okay?

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:33.715
- I...

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:36.818
I can't move.

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:41.056
- [Matt] Me neither.

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:46.694
- They have cameras.

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:53.668
- Victor.

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.103
What the fuck?

01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:58.073
- (demonic voice)
Everything leading up to

01:07:58.075 --> 01:08:01.509
this moment is in
preparation for tonight.

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:02.777
- Fuck that.

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:03.745
Let us go.

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:07.515
(menacing laugh)

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:08.850
- It's impressive, huh?

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:12.387
It's just a special
mix I created.

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:16.624
You've made some good steps.

01:08:18.228 --> 01:08:20.328
But you've become a
little too resistant.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.535
- Tobin.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:28.603
- (demonic voice) We've
brought who you are,

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.138
and who you want to be,

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.207
to the forefront of
your subconscious.

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:35.443
And tonight, you will
allow your conscious mind

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.313
to take control of your
deepest thoughts and desires.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:41.483
- What do you want from us?

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:47.188
- I want you to get
your life together.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:50.325
Or get the fuck off this Earth.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.832
Self-enlightenment
through substance

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:00.801
is a centuries old tradition.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:02.670
The Native Americans had peyote.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.607
The Amazonians had ayahuasca.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:06.808
And the hippies had LSD.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.844
We've created something better.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.346
More focused.

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:15.617
- If you think that I
am taking anything...

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:20.287
- Beth.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.492
You've already taken it.

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:34.935
Since you have
gotten here, I have

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:37.671
made it clear that I
am not your friend.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.307
I am your enemy.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:41.609
I am your demons personified.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:43.611
Now will you rise up?

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:47.515
Or will you crumble?

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:50.752
(otherworldly noises)

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.694
- Looks like we're alone.

01:10:01.965 --> 01:10:03.598
What do you wanna do to me?

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:10.438
What if I said you could
do anything you wanted?

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:15.510
Please?

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.349
Really.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:23.351
Please?

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:25.353
- What are you doing?

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:27.789
- I'm scared.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:30.825
- What makes you think I care?

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:37.966
Wait.

01:10:37.968 --> 01:10:40.535
Did you think we're friends?

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:41.769
- I'm sorry Matt.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:45.740
- Nobody here cares about
you, don't you get that?

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.710
I think you know that deep down.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:49.811
- Stop it.

01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:52.847
- You're just a slut.

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:55.650
A lowlife.

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:01.489
If I was you, I'd kill myself.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.561
But you failed at
that too didn't you?

01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:07.462
- Stop it!

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:12.934
- I only fucked you
because I pitied you.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:14.902
And I regret it.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.673
You're disgusting.

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:19.574
- Stop it!

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.444
(heavy breathing)

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:25.580
(sobs)

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:26.514
(demonic voice) I hate you!

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:27.348
I hate you!

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.316
I hate you!

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:35.690
- [Tobin] (demonic voice)
Come and meet your destiny.

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:37.859
I will not tolerate weakness.

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:41.796
The weak are a plague that
must be pure of light.

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:45.733
I save life if it's deserving.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:48.936
Are you storing life
that is unworthy?

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:57.779
(Danni screams)

01:11:57.781 --> 01:12:00.915
(otherworldly growls)

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:06.921
And this is the path.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.898
- [Arthur] Lucky people.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.974
- So there I was, lost
in my own ignorance.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:29.977
Thinking erroneously that
there was no way out.

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:32.613
But Vance changed all that.

01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:36.884
I was stuck in love with
the next wife who was

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:40.988
emotionally abusing me
and taking away my power.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:44.392
Tobin taught me how
to take my power back.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:46.928
And now she's gone.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:49.997
- [Group Member] Do
you guys still talk?

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:51.733
- No.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:54.535
She passed away.

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.106
- You see, you can't look at

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:01.109
hunting as a hobby or a passion.

01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:03.044
It's a ritual.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:06.514
It's an exchange
of life and death.

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:09.016
When the animal is
killed, there's a rebirth

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:11.853
inside of you to
accompany that death.

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:14.822
I learned all of this
from Tobin Vance.

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:17.925
He allowed me to see
my true inner self.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:19.160
He gave me the tools necessary

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.496
to become the man you
see before you now.

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:23.831
You know what?

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.933
You should take a seminar.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:28.669
If you mention my
name you get 30% off.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:30.571
- I knew that as
soon as I stepped

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.039
under those lights
on a sound stage

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:35.510
I was exactly where
I was supposed to be.

01:13:35.512 --> 01:13:36.978
Because Tobin's
training taught me

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.814
that I just had to
embrace my inner self.

01:13:39.816 --> 01:13:41.749
Ever since I was
a little kid I was

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.951
lying to create my own reality,

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:45.920
so you know, what
was I supposed to do?

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.889
Continue screwing up my life?

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:50.925
Or just focus it into
something positive?

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:54.529
And what I really needed
was to find my confidence.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:56.931
So now I get to
make up new personas

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.000
for other people to enjoy.

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:00.001
And we just got picked up for

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:01.869
a second season for the sitcom.

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:03.771
What's really
exciting is that I've

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:06.040
gotten the majority of the cast

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:08.209
to sign up for Vance seminars.

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:09.710
- After all these
years of marriage

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:10.878
and I can't get to
get through to you--

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.047
(gasps and screams)

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:14.148
- What the?

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:16.117
What the fuck was that?

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.120
- What were you just
complaining about?

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.691
You can't remember right?

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:25.860
Because that wasn't
the real problem.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:29.030
I was like you once.

01:14:29.032 --> 01:14:30.698
Believe it or not.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:31.999
I needed help too.

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:38.005
I thought I was my
enemy, but I was wrong.

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:40.875
That was a lie I
told myself to keep

01:14:40.877 --> 01:14:43.711
from dealing with
my real problems.

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:47.982
Hidden behind my fear,
insecurity, weakness.

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:52.019
But then one day I learned
it was all a choice.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:54.922
And I found my way through it.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.092
Do you wanna know how?

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:08.803
- I'm here today because
Tobin Vance saved my life.

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:14.809
You're here because
you want guidance.

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:16.611
You're here because you wanna

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:19.080
make a difference in your life.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:23.284
You're here because
of Tobin Vance.

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:25.987
So let's bring him out!

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:29.023
(cheers and applause)

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:36.998
- Let's make some
magic today shall we?

01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:40.034
You have a problem.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.903
You don't know your own power.

01:15:41.905 --> 01:15:43.671
But that is not your fault.

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:47.141
You don't have anybody else to
blame so you blame yourself.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:50.878
Life is about overcoming
obstacles, but when

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.115
you're the biggest obstacle,
you lose either way!

01:15:55.652 --> 01:15:59.554
Finding your purpose should
be your number one goal.

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:03.224
And you can't do that unless
you identify your enemy.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:07.028
But when you can rise
up, and you can beat

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:10.798
that enemy, the
possibilities are limitless.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.067
You can rule the world.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.138
You took the first step.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.072
You came here today.

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:21.008
Say yes to that.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.009
- [Crowd] Yes!

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:25.246
(cheers and applause)

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.819
- Now tell me.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:33.988
Right now.

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.290
How have you changed?

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:51.238
(dramatic atmosphere music)
