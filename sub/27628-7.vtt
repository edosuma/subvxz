00:36.088 --> 00:38.016
Mrs M.

00:38.016 --> 00:40.016
Mrs M.

00:42.012 --> 00:43.088
Oh, yes. Yes.

00:46.068 --> 00:48.076
Mary, Peter.

00:48.076 --> 00:50.072
Are you ready?

00:53.048 --> 00:57.032
We are gathered here today
to witness the marriage

00:57.032 --> 00:58.048
of Peter and Mary.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.004
Oi! Come here!

01:38.004 --> 01:40.008
When are you going to get it
into your thick skull,

01:40.008 --> 01:41.076
I don't want to be with you
any more!

01:41.076 --> 01:44.012
What, you honestly think
you can do better than me?

01:44.012 --> 01:45.060
Get your dirty hands off me!

01:54.008 --> 01:55.072
Get off the road!

02:14.012 --> 02:17.048
Father, are you sure
you don't mind me leaving

02:17.048 --> 02:19.092
early like this?Not at all.

02:21.032 --> 02:25.040
Let me guess. You're going to visit
Patrick O'Leary. Again.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.088
It's his borders. They're in
a terrible state!

02:28.088 --> 02:32.048
They must be. Honestly, spending all
this time with a wealthy bachelor,

02:32.048 --> 02:33.096
you'll set tongues wagging.

02:33.096 --> 02:36.076
I'm sure Patrick appreciates
your kindness, Mrs McCarthy.

02:38.016 --> 02:40.036
Oh, I said I'd be there
by four o'clock!

02:43.020 --> 02:45.032
Tongues couldn't be wagging
any more furiously.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.032
That ivy looks sensational.

02:54.024 --> 02:57.000
That is clematis.See?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.088
This is why I need
you here, Bridget.

02:58.088 --> 03:00.056
To put me right on things.

03:00.056 --> 03:04.032
You know a lot more about gardening,
Patrick O'Leary, than you let on.

03:04.032 --> 03:07.080
You've spoilt me with kindness
these past few weeks, Bridget.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.080
Well, hardly your fault your
gardener decided

03:10.080 --> 03:12.032
to abandon you, was it?

03:15.040 --> 03:19.084
Blessing shall be the reward
of kindly hearts. Oh...

03:24.080 --> 03:25.092
Patrick? What is it?

03:28.024 --> 03:30.012
A slight pain. Nothing at all.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.096
There.I'm feeling better
already, Bridget.

03:37.096 --> 03:41.004
Thank you.Mrs McCarthy.

03:41.004 --> 03:43.068
Oh, Francesca. George.Ma'am.

03:43.068 --> 03:46.048
I'm afraid Patrick's
had a slight turn.

03:46.048 --> 03:49.044
Oh, he needs to be resting,
not exhausting himself

03:49.044 --> 03:51.040
outside with you.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.068
Well, thanks to Mrs McCarthy,
I was barely lifting a finger.

03:54.068 --> 03:58.056
Even so, you have a weak heart,
and as the doctor said...Francesca.

04:01.096 --> 04:04.084
Have you not got work to do?

04:04.084 --> 04:06.084
We've done the whole house, Sir.

04:12.056 --> 04:16.064
Something the matter, Mrs McCarthy?
No, no.

04:19.043 --> 04:24.004
Uncle, have you asked Mrs McCarthy
about this evening?Ah, yes.

04:24.004 --> 04:25.028
Thank you, Maria.

04:26.052 --> 04:28.004
Now, Mrs McCarthy.

04:28.004 --> 04:30.056
I wonder would you do me the honour
of joining me and my niece

04:30.056 --> 04:33.056
for dinner here tonight?Oh!

04:33.056 --> 04:35.056
I've been begging him
to ask you for ages,

04:35.056 --> 04:37.044
given he's so fond of you.

04:38.048 --> 04:41.072
Well, that would be lovely.
Wonderful!

04:46.000 --> 04:51.016
Now, I can't stop long, Father,
but I have made you a shepherd's pie

04:51.016 --> 04:54.064
for your tea.That's very kind,
Mrs McCarthy.

04:55.068 --> 05:00.064
May I say, what a lovely dress.
Oh, this.

05:00.064 --> 05:02.060
I haven't worn it in years.

05:04.052 --> 05:06.096
Bette Davis, eat your heart out!

05:06.096 --> 05:12.004
Penelope, please!Seriously!
Patrick O'Leary is one lucky man.

05:12.004 --> 05:16.040
I can assure you, Mr O'Leary is
nothing more than a...

05:16.040 --> 05:19.064
..horticultural friend.
Now, I must be going!

05:20.076 --> 05:23.000
Have a lovely evening, Mrs McCarthy.

06:02.088 --> 06:07.068
'Guard lips and tongue as thou
would guard thy life from peril.'

06:14.060 --> 06:19.008
Oh, yes. They're a funny lot
in Yorkshire!

06:19.008 --> 06:23.020
Tell me, what made you come to
Kembleford? Thank you.

06:23.020 --> 06:27.080
Well, you know, I had sold the Bible
publishing business, and...

06:28.080 --> 06:31.056
Well, the time comes
when we all just need a change.

06:35.004 --> 06:38.000
Maria.I'm fine.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.036
A year since her husband passed.
A year ago today?

06:45.072 --> 06:50.088
I am so sorry.I'll be all right,
really. George.

06:52.072 --> 06:56.008
I want to know all about you,
Mrs McCarthy. Me?!

06:56.008 --> 07:00.064
Oh... Nothing to tell!Well, what
happened to your husband?

07:01.060 --> 07:05.052
You are Mrs McCarthy?Yes.

07:05.052 --> 07:07.060
You don't have to talk
about it, Bridget.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.092
Don't pretend you're not
madly curious, Uncle.

07:13.012 --> 07:15.036
Oh, yes. Do tell.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Angelica.You didn't change
the locks, Patrick.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.056
I don't know, maybe you wanted me to
come back. No, no.

07:25.056 --> 07:26.060
Don't get up.

07:28.004 --> 07:29.008
So, um...

07:30.096 --> 07:32.096
Who's this?

07:32.096 --> 07:35.080
Mrs McCarthy has been very kindly
helping out in the garden

07:35.080 --> 07:36.088
since you left.

07:38.064 --> 07:40.060
Since I was asked to leave.

07:41.092 --> 07:45.040
So, this was your gardener?Oh, yes.

07:45.040 --> 07:48.044
We mowed lots of grass,
me and Patrick.

07:48.044 --> 07:49.096
Didn't we, Francesca?

07:52.052 --> 07:54.024
What do you want, Angelica?

07:55.080 --> 08:01.004
To let you know that your
threats are in vain.

08:01.004 --> 08:03.084
Tomorrow morning, I'm going to tell
the world the truth.

08:05.056 --> 08:09.028
I no longer fear your
disapproval, Patrick.

08:09.028 --> 08:10.044
I'm beyond that.

08:12.012 --> 08:16.080
You see, in this house,
we set our eyes on what is unseen.

08:21.056 --> 08:23.024
Not on what we can see.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.096
Angelica?

08:55.056 --> 08:56.060
Bridget?

08:57.088 --> 09:00.084
I have a very early
Mass tomorrow, so...

09:00.084 --> 09:04.072
Angelica had a crisis
of faith a while back.

09:04.072 --> 09:07.044
It was brought on by the sudden
passing of her parents.

09:07.044 --> 09:11.056
They died within a week of each
other. Oh, that poor girl!

09:11.056 --> 09:14.000
She began questioning
the very existence of God.

09:15.008 --> 09:17.004
Then she turned to the bottle.

09:17.004 --> 09:19.072
Well, this being such
a holy house...

09:19.072 --> 09:23.036
So that was why you had
to ask her to leave.

09:23.036 --> 09:26.088
She has since veered even
further from the path.

09:26.088 --> 09:29.024
It has been painful to behold.

09:29.024 --> 09:33.024
I can imagine. I am sorry for
the both of you.

09:38.024 --> 09:39.088
You're a wonderful woman, Bridget.

09:41.088 --> 09:46.004
I suspect not enough men have told
you that in your life.

09:46.004 --> 09:48.096
I love your kind heart,
and your faith.

09:51.004 --> 09:53.056
I love that you tell me what to do!

09:54.096 --> 09:58.040
But most of all, I love your eyes.

10:02.056 --> 10:05.060
I really should go.

10:05.060 --> 10:08.084
Thank you for a lovely evening.

10:24.044 --> 10:25.080
Look after one another.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.064
Oi! Angelica!

10:27.064 --> 10:30.064
I swear if you come anywhere near me
again, Eddie Trist...

10:32.076 --> 10:35.028
Is there something I can do to help?

10:35.028 --> 10:40.028
No! Hey. Save a place for me,
won't you?

10:40.028 --> 10:41.096
What's she doing here?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.072
Are you absolutely sure?

10:45.096 --> 10:48.060
No... I'm fine.

11:32.008 --> 11:35.008
Dominus illuminatio
mea, et salus mea.

11:38.080 --> 11:44.044
1 Corinthians, chapter 14, verse 34.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.052
'And the women will stay silent
in the churches...'

11:51.096 --> 11:54.040
This woman will...

12:02.088 --> 12:05.012
Angelica? Angelica?

12:12.080 --> 12:13.096
Well, Padre.

12:13.096 --> 12:16.068
She was at least spared hearing
you prattle on for three hours.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.020
Cyanide poison?Yes, thank you.

12:18.020 --> 12:21.000
I did detect the aroma
of almonds on the victim,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.008
along with the contents
of the pub cellar.

12:24.008 --> 12:26.036
She was about to announce something.

12:26.036 --> 12:30.044
Save your theories, Padre.
We've found our man.

12:30.044 --> 12:34.016
It wasn't me!Eddie Trist, born
troublemaker.

12:34.016 --> 12:37.024
Humiliated by the deceased yesterday
in front of his drinking pals.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.072
Seen barging into the victim's house
in the early hours of this morning

12:40.072 --> 12:44.052
to exact his revenge.That's when
you think he poisoned her?

12:44.052 --> 12:47.044
To most, an overreaction,
but to Eddie Trist,

12:47.044 --> 12:49.072
merely settling a score.

12:49.072 --> 12:54.016
A small amount of cyanide
can take hours to kill.

12:54.016 --> 12:56.016
It might widen the field a little.

12:56.016 --> 12:58.020
Thank you for the toxicology
lesson, Padre.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.060
That poor girl.

13:11.060 --> 13:14.064
I heard Eddie Trist
always was a bit wild.

13:14.064 --> 13:17.052
Up to no good since he could crawl.

13:17.052 --> 13:22.012
But procurement of cyanide
is a complicated process.

13:22.012 --> 13:25.092
It's not exactly the modus operandi
for a crime passionnel,

13:25.092 --> 13:28.056
which is Mallory's theory.

13:28.056 --> 13:32.044
Did Angelica eat anything last
night?No.

13:32.044 --> 13:35.000
Well, she had some wine,
but it was the same wine

13:35.000 --> 13:36.052
that everyone else drank.

13:36.052 --> 13:40.072
Could someone have added poison to
the wine?I don't see how.

13:40.072 --> 13:44.024
The decanter was on the table
right in front of me,

13:44.024 --> 13:46.024
and she just helped herself.

13:46.024 --> 13:48.004
Where did she get the glass from?

13:48.004 --> 13:52.036
She snatched it out of poor George's
hand the minute she arrived.

13:52.036 --> 13:55.016
Maybe she was poisoned
in her own home.

14:00.072 --> 14:04.020
Well, Eddie. You've excelled
yourself this time.

14:04.020 --> 14:07.036
I bet no-one's ever said
that to you before, Mallory.

14:07.036 --> 14:10.072
Kembleford's going to be an awful
lot quieter

14:10.072 --> 14:15.008
with you in six feet of quicklime.
I've done nothing wrong!

14:15.008 --> 14:17.032
It's a peculiar feeling,
let me tell you.

14:17.032 --> 14:19.048
You were seen at the victim's house.

14:19.048 --> 14:23.060
An hour later, she's dead from
poisoning. Is that it?!

14:23.060 --> 14:27.076
The same woman who had recently
ended your relationship.

14:27.076 --> 14:31.092
We got drunk, we rolled in the hay.
It was hardly Brief Encounter.

14:31.092 --> 14:34.060
She also kicked you in
the where's-your-fathers!

14:34.060 --> 14:36.032
In front of an audience.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.000
All you've got on me is a grudge.

14:45.096 --> 14:49.088
Let's see what a jury
thinks, shall we? Mmm.

14:58.092 --> 15:02.072
I'm so sorry to bother you, officer,
but my car won't start.

15:02.072 --> 15:06.060
I don't suppose you could
help me with it?

15:06.060 --> 15:09.052
Very well, madam.Thank you so much!

15:09.052 --> 15:12.020
I'm utterly hopeless
with the sorts of things.

15:12.020 --> 15:15.004
I think there might be some
water in the carburettor?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.000
Who could've done such a thing?

15:51.096 --> 15:55.096
Someone who did not
know the true Angelica.

15:55.096 --> 16:00.024
She had her faults, but I was very
fond of her. I know.

16:00.024 --> 16:01.028
I know.

16:03.056 --> 16:05.060
There's something I'd been
planning to do today.

16:09.052 --> 16:13.096
Oh, that is beautiful.It's yours.

16:13.096 --> 16:18.028
No, Patrick. Not today, not
after what...

16:18.028 --> 16:20.012
This is nothing to do with Angelica.

16:20.012 --> 16:24.000
I've wanted you to have it
for a while now.

16:34.032 --> 16:36.016
You're a joke, Mallory!

16:36.016 --> 16:40.004
Oh, the irony! He thinks I'm the
joke, Sergeant.

16:40.004 --> 16:42.012
Well, I'm certainly not
laughing, Sir. Exactly.

16:42.012 --> 16:44.032
Angelica's postmortem.Well?

16:44.032 --> 16:47.060
The amount of hydrogen cyanide found
in her blood was very small.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.064
She could've ingested it up to 12
hours before she died.

16:50.064 --> 16:52.080
It opens up the case a bit.

16:52.080 --> 16:56.032
All this means is that Eddie slipped
the poison into Angelica's drink

16:56.032 --> 16:59.068
at the pub yesterday. We've just got
to prove it.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.080
Good gosh! Is that from Patrick?

17:38.060 --> 17:40.076
I wonder how big the ring will be!

17:40.076 --> 17:45.056
Penelope, don't be ridiculous!Well,
he's obviously working up to it.

17:45.056 --> 17:48.088
Oh, Father. I wondered
where you'd been.

17:50.076 --> 17:53.080
I have been trying to make sense
of the wedding veil

17:53.080 --> 17:55.048
in Angelica's fireplace,

17:55.048 --> 17:59.036
so I telephoned the marriage records
office in Yorkshire,

17:59.036 --> 18:02.036
and I made a rather
surprising discovery...

18:05.024 --> 18:06.060
..about Patrick O'Leary.

18:14.064 --> 18:15.068
Well?

18:17.092 --> 18:19.056
Yes.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.052
Angelica was my wife.

18:21.052 --> 18:24.012
Your wife?

18:24.012 --> 18:27.020
We met in Yorkshire,
through the church.

18:27.020 --> 18:31.000
We married four years later.I see.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.004
So why pretend
she was your gardener?

18:35.032 --> 18:39.016
After Angelica lost God,
our marriage rather fell apart,

18:39.016 --> 18:42.028
but neither of us wanted
the humiliation of a divorce.

18:42.028 --> 18:44.060
That's why we came here,
where no-one knew us,

18:44.060 --> 18:49.008
where we could live our own lives.
And it was fine...

18:49.008 --> 18:51.016
..until her drinking started.

18:53.044 --> 18:56.060
I wanted to tell you, but I was
worried it would scare you away.

18:56.060 --> 19:00.052
It won't, will it?Well, I...

19:00.052 --> 19:04.048
Before you answer that,
I have something else to share.

19:06.020 --> 19:09.008
I don't know how much time
I have left down here.

19:09.008 --> 19:10.056
In Kembleford?

19:12.040 --> 19:14.036
On Earth.Oh...

19:14.036 --> 19:18.004
The prognosis for my heart,
my doctor is not optimistic.

19:18.004 --> 19:22.052
Oh, dear Lord!That's why Angelica
had to leave this house.

19:22.052 --> 19:25.012
The anxiety was threatening
to kill me.

19:25.012 --> 19:28.072
But I'm determined to make the most
of the life I have left.

19:28.072 --> 19:33.092
Which is why, Bridget, I so
desperately hope you can forgive me.

19:34.092 --> 19:38.080
I don't want to lose you, ever.

19:58.012 --> 20:02.028
I've spoken to Father Brown.
He brought me up to speed.Yes.

20:02.028 --> 20:04.056
Well, before you make
any smart remarks,

20:04.056 --> 20:08.000
I am not in the mood.
I'm not that cruel, Mrs M.

20:09.060 --> 20:11.092
What kind of man makes his wife
pretend to be his gardener

20:11.092 --> 20:14.004
and then fires her?

20:14.004 --> 20:17.024
Oh, you will stay away
from him now, won't you?

20:17.024 --> 20:21.000
Part of me feels a bit sorry for
him. What?! Why?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.032
Well, the poor man
has just lost his wife.

20:23.032 --> 20:27.004
He disowned her.And then there's
his health... Mrs M...

20:28.080 --> 20:30.048
Maybe I was too harsh.

21:21.052 --> 21:23.008
Bridget.

21:23.008 --> 21:26.040
I came to apologise.
Whatever for?

21:26.040 --> 21:31.064
Earlier today, I think I was rather
unsympathetic. Not at all.

21:31.064 --> 21:33.036
It was a lot to take in.

21:35.004 --> 21:36.036
Won't you come in?

21:38.044 --> 21:39.084
Oh...

21:49.088 --> 21:52.028
Are you all right, Bridget?

21:52.028 --> 21:56.016
Oh, just my mind playing
tricks, I think.

21:57.096 --> 22:02.040
A glass of wine, perhaps?
Tea, thank you.

22:31.020 --> 22:32.048
Bridget...

22:34.096 --> 22:37.008
Let me explain.No!

22:38.076 --> 22:40.056
Bridget, please!

22:48.016 --> 22:49.056
Mrs McCarthy.

22:52.028 --> 22:58.020
What's the matter?Patrick is also
married to Francesca.

22:58.020 --> 23:01.036
And to Maria.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.012
To every woman in
that house, in fact.

23:06.068 --> 23:08.040
He's a bigamist, Father!

23:09.052 --> 23:11.008
Oh, Mrs McCarthy.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.028
And I'm the greatest fool,
that I allowed myself even

23:20.028 --> 23:23.056
for one second...You couldn't
possibly have known.

23:23.056 --> 23:26.012
..that a man like that
would be interested in me.

23:28.012 --> 23:31.032
There was bound to be
a catch, wasn't there?

23:33.008 --> 23:37.044
So many lies, from all of them!

23:40.020 --> 23:42.060
What Bridget thinks
she saw in that album...

23:42.060 --> 23:46.068
Patrick, I have spoken
to marriage and birth records.

23:46.068 --> 23:49.000
George is your son, isn't he?

23:52.008 --> 23:55.084
Do not judge me unkindly, Father.
Only God can judge.

23:56.080 --> 24:00.040
I'm here out of concern
for Mrs McCarthy's safety.

24:01.040 --> 24:05.028
I was going to tell her the truth,
at the right time.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.072
I'm glad to hear it.

24:08.092 --> 24:11.092
The arrangement we have in this
house may be unusual,

24:11.092 --> 24:13.080
but it is not ungodly.

24:15.084 --> 24:19.004
Look at Abraham, Jacob,
David, Solomon.

24:19.004 --> 24:20.096
Each took more than one wife.

24:20.096 --> 24:23.020
And which were condemned
by the Lord for doing so?

24:23.020 --> 24:25.056
None of them.Precisely.

24:25.056 --> 24:28.024
God can see this is a happy house,
with good people

24:28.024 --> 24:32.076
who have chosen to be here.
Was Angelica happy?

24:33.092 --> 24:36.036
Until she lost her faith, yes.

24:36.036 --> 24:40.020
She stopped believing in God,
and stopped believing in you.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.084
That was the secret she was about to
share at St Mary's.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.044
The truth about this house.

24:48.044 --> 24:52.016
I assure you what happened to poor
Angelica had nothing to do with me,

24:52.016 --> 24:54.004
or anyone else in my home.

24:56.012 --> 24:59.008
I trust I can count
on your discretion in this?

24:59.008 --> 25:03.092
There's so much at stake,
for all of us here.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.072
I understand. Yes.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.060
I've been married to Patrick
for nearly 20 years.

25:23.092 --> 25:25.024
20 years?

25:27.032 --> 25:31.012
Yes, well, that certainly explains
the funny looks you always gave me.

25:31.012 --> 25:34.008
I love him with all my heart.

25:34.008 --> 25:37.068
And you agreed to share him
with two other women.

25:37.068 --> 25:39.076
The father of your child!

25:39.076 --> 25:43.076
Patrick showed me that God
has given him his permission

25:43.076 --> 25:46.072
to take other wives.
And you believed him.

25:47.088 --> 25:52.052
The Lord gave me the strength
I needed to accept it.

25:52.052 --> 25:55.036
What is it you want
from me, Francesca?

25:55.036 --> 25:58.088
Your word you will
say nothing of this.

25:58.088 --> 26:02.084
Oh, so I just turn a blind eye?
You must!

26:02.084 --> 26:09.000
Your house of God is a house
of lies, a den of sin,

26:09.000 --> 26:13.044
and Patrick O'Leary should go
to prison for having built it.

26:13.044 --> 26:16.004
But so will I, Mrs McCarthy.

26:16.004 --> 26:19.092
And that would mean George
going into care,

26:19.092 --> 26:21.092
which would destroy me.

26:41.020 --> 26:43.020
Mrs McCarthy?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.036
Mrs McCarthy.

26:48.092 --> 26:52.000
Has anyone from Patrick's house
been here?Francesca.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.008
Begging me to keep quiet.

26:54.008 --> 26:57.008
Needless to say, Mrs M
has told me all about it.

26:57.008 --> 27:00.076
Did Francesca leave anything,
touch anything?No. Why?

27:00.076 --> 27:04.012
I think Angelica was silenced
by someone in that house,

27:04.012 --> 27:06.032
and if they silenced her...

27:06.032 --> 27:08.052
They could do the same to me!

27:08.052 --> 27:11.084
Sweet Jesus!Where are you going?

27:11.084 --> 27:14.052
To see Inspector Mallory.

27:14.052 --> 27:19.032
Whatever for?They can hardly
silence me if I've already reported

27:19.032 --> 27:23.008
their dirty little secret.
In that case, we'll go with you.

27:35.096 --> 27:38.056
Who in their right mind
would want to share their husband

27:38.056 --> 27:42.016
with two other women?All three
wives had their reasons, I'm sure.

27:42.016 --> 27:45.004
It must get so complicated.Hmm...

27:45.004 --> 27:49.000
God doesn't actually support bigamy,
does he, Father?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.068
I don't believe so.

27:50.068 --> 27:54.080
However, nowhere in the Bible does
he expressly forbid it,

27:54.080 --> 27:57.044
which rather leaves things
open to interpretation.

27:57.044 --> 28:00.044
I bet Patrick couldn't
believe his luck!

28:00.044 --> 28:01.080
Oh.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.036
A word, father?

28:04.036 --> 28:08.080
Er, I'll go and arrange that
for you, Father.Oh, yes.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.084
Thank you, Bunty.

28:11.084 --> 28:16.080
Where's Mrs McCarthy?
Inside, with the inspector.

28:18.024 --> 28:20.088
Then it's the end of everything.

28:20.088 --> 28:23.032
According to the marriage
records office,

28:23.032 --> 28:25.032
your first husband's still alive.

28:26.056 --> 28:28.092
He is dead to me.

28:28.092 --> 28:31.024
He hurt me. Often.

28:32.092 --> 28:34.084
A year ago I escaped.

28:34.084 --> 28:38.040
I was sleeping on the streets in
Gloucester. I had nothing.

28:38.040 --> 28:43.000
And then Patrick found me
and gave me sanctuary.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.008
In return for becoming his third
wife,

28:46.008 --> 28:48.064
and playing the part
of a widowed niece.

28:48.064 --> 28:52.064
His home is the most
beautiful place in the world.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.008
A true house of God.

28:55.008 --> 28:58.012
For the first time in my life
I felt safe.

28:59.056 --> 29:00.088
And now it's over.

29:13.012 --> 29:16.088
So, what do you intend doing
about it, Inspector?

29:18.040 --> 29:20.064
Inspector?

29:20.064 --> 29:26.048
Mm?You do agree that those women
and that poor boy must be rescued

29:26.048 --> 29:29.060
from that sordid den of iniquity?

29:29.060 --> 29:35.016
Sordid, yes.And that Patrick
O'Leary is a disgrace of a man,

29:35.016 --> 29:39.072
who deserves to be put
behind bars. Absolutely.

29:41.036 --> 29:44.056
Three wives, you say?Yes.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.000
Unbelievable.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.056
It makes me think of
that old Bob Hope quip,

29:51.056 --> 29:54.060
about bigamy being the only time
two rites make a wrong.

29:56.008 --> 29:59.072
It's a play on words.
Rites is spelt R-I-T-E-S.

30:03.012 --> 30:05.068
Doesn't matter.Inspector.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.080
I think we need to get Mr O'Leary
in for a chat, hadn't we?

30:13.088 --> 30:17.080
Find out exactly what was
going on in that house.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.048
How it all worked.

30:25.060 --> 30:28.012
So, let me get this straight.

30:28.012 --> 30:31.092
One day, out of the blue,
you told Francesca that God wanted

30:31.092 --> 30:35.072
you to take another wife,
and she went along with it.

30:38.008 --> 30:41.064
You're clearly a remarkably
persuasive man, Mr O'Leary.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.060
Three spouses,

30:45.060 --> 30:48.068
all younger than you,

30:48.068 --> 30:51.016
including one who is 28.

30:53.048 --> 30:56.076
You certainly appear
to have covered all the bases.

30:56.076 --> 30:58.048
Age is irrelevant in our house.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.076
The only thing that matters
is serving God.

31:04.032 --> 31:05.092
Of course.

31:05.092 --> 31:08.032
Well, you're looking
at a seven-year stretch for this.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.000
I hope it was worth it.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.016
I suspect it probably was.

31:17.028 --> 31:20.020
I assume there was
some sort of rota?

31:23.072 --> 31:24.076
Ladies.

31:32.036 --> 31:35.044
Well, Goodfellow, I don't know if
that man should be slapped in jail

31:35.044 --> 31:37.092
or given a medal.I still think one
of them could've murdered

31:37.092 --> 31:40.008
Angelica O'Leary, Sir.
They all had good reason to.

31:40.008 --> 31:42.096
They're each other's alibis
that none of them left the house

31:42.096 --> 31:44.068
in the hours before the victim died.

31:44.068 --> 31:47.024
And, given that she didn't eat
or drink anything personal

31:47.024 --> 31:49.084
to her when she visited...
Sir.

31:51.028 --> 31:54.016
To be fair, sir, we still haven't
got any proof that Eddie Trist

31:54.016 --> 31:57.020
did it, either.We do now, Sergeant.
We do now!

31:57.020 --> 32:02.008
Traces of the same poison found in
a jar on the work shelf of his shed.

32:02.008 --> 32:05.036
So, while we're waiting
for all the marriage certificates,

32:05.036 --> 32:08.032
let's get these deviants out
on bail.

32:08.032 --> 32:10.048
I've got a murderer to charge.

32:14.016 --> 32:17.068
Imagine if Patrick had produced
a ring and you said yes

32:17.068 --> 32:20.048
and accidentally signed up
for Sodom and Gomorrah!

32:27.048 --> 32:29.004
Here it is.

32:29.004 --> 32:31.096
'The seeds of stone fruit
such as apricots,

32:31.096 --> 32:35.080
'plums and cherries contain
a substance which releases

32:35.080 --> 32:38.052
'cyanide when metabolised.'

32:38.052 --> 32:40.032
Yes.

32:40.032 --> 32:42.004
And?

32:42.004 --> 32:45.064
The night before Angelica died,
there were fruit pips on Patrick's

32:45.064 --> 32:50.012
kitchen floor, and I am sure
they were cherry pips.

32:50.012 --> 32:52.044
That is very useful.

32:52.044 --> 32:55.016
Very useful indeed, Mrs McCarthy.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.080
Yes, well done, Mrs M.

32:56.080 --> 32:59.048
And I just thought Francesca
had been a bit slack

32:59.048 --> 33:01.012
with her cleaning.

33:01.012 --> 33:04.048
If that's where the cyanide came
from, then who prepared it?

33:04.048 --> 33:06.088
And how did they get
Angelica to ingest it?

33:06.088 --> 33:09.068
Tell me again exactly what happened

33:09.068 --> 33:12.092
when Angelica gate-crashed
the dinner.

33:29.036 --> 33:31.008
Disgusting!

33:33.000 --> 33:36.012
Forgive them.

33:38.052 --> 33:41.068
Look at them. No shame.
I can't believe it.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.056
Bridget.Might I have a word?

33:54.056 --> 33:56.088
I'll join you in a minute.

34:02.056 --> 34:04.092
I thought I could
trust you, Bridget.

34:04.092 --> 34:06.088
Well, that makes two of us.

34:08.068 --> 34:13.004
This belonged to
Angelica, didn't it?

34:14.043 --> 34:17.056
You are a shameless man,
Patrick O'Leary... Bridget...

34:17.056 --> 34:22.020
..all baubles and flowers
and honey words.

34:22.020 --> 34:26.024
And none of it meaning a thing.
That's not true. As the Lord says...

34:26.024 --> 34:30.052
Don't you dare try and twist
the Holy Book with me!

34:30.052 --> 34:34.072
You are a manipulator and a bully,

34:34.072 --> 34:38.043
and you deserve whatever fate
comes your way.

34:41.016 --> 34:45.012
Bridget, please!
Mrs McCarthy to you.

34:52.032 --> 34:54.043
There you go, Mrs M.

34:54.043 --> 34:56.007
That'll do you a world of good.

34:56.007 --> 35:00.040
He has no scruples, that man. None!
I agree.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.064
Maybe he murdered poor Angelica.

35:02.064 --> 35:05.096
He's certainly capable of it,
I've no doubt about that.

35:05.096 --> 35:08.096
If he did do it, then he must've put
the poison in that wine.

35:08.096 --> 35:12.088
I have told you, Angelica drank
from the same decanter

35:12.088 --> 35:14.096
as the rest of us.

35:14.096 --> 35:18.008
Are you certain that no-one
could've slipped anything

35:18.008 --> 35:20.036
in it when she arrived?
Oh, think, Mrs M.

35:36.044 --> 35:39.088
He had the glass ready.Patrick?

35:39.088 --> 35:42.000
No, George.

35:47.084 --> 35:49.096
Oh, Marjorie. Have you seen
Father Brown?

35:49.096 --> 35:51.088
Sorry, Mrs McCarthy, no.

35:51.088 --> 35:54.040
Let's split up.Good idea.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.060
Er, right.

36:38.056 --> 36:40.096
Maria.You're OK.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Let's go.Yes!

37:04.040 --> 37:05.056
Where are you?

37:07.012 --> 37:09.080
Wait, stop! Please!

37:12.008 --> 37:14.004
Father Brown, you are a marvel.

37:28.060 --> 37:30.096
Don't mind if I join you, do you?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.044
Going far?

37:35.024 --> 37:36.060
What do you want, Father?

37:36.060 --> 37:40.064
The wine glass that Angelica took
from you had poison in it,

37:40.064 --> 37:41.068
didn't it, George?

37:42.084 --> 37:46.068
But you didn't put it in there,
because it wasn't your idea

37:46.068 --> 37:50.056
to murder Angelica.
What are you talking about?

37:50.056 --> 37:54.048
George did what he did for love,
and it has become clear to me

37:54.048 --> 37:57.024
that he is very much
in love with you.

37:57.024 --> 38:00.076
You're wrong. It was all my idea.

38:02.012 --> 38:04.040
Um, how did you procure the poison?

38:04.040 --> 38:08.064
The cherry tree.Tell me, George,
because I'm interested.

38:08.064 --> 38:12.072
How did you extract cyanide
from a cherry tree?I...

38:13.096 --> 38:19.064
It was you, Maria, that extracted
the poison from the cherry pips.

38:19.064 --> 38:22.052
It was you that delivered
the letter to Angelica,

38:22.052 --> 38:25.076
knowing it would provoke her
to visit that evening.

38:25.076 --> 38:30.064
And it was you who persuaded poor
lovelorn George here,

38:30.064 --> 38:35.012
to hold out the wineglass that
you had lined with poison.

38:35.012 --> 38:37.048
And you even ensured
that Mrs McCarthy was there

38:37.048 --> 38:41.036
to testify that you had
kept your hands clean.

38:41.036 --> 38:43.072
Why would I do any of that?

38:43.072 --> 38:46.068
Because Angelica was
about to cost you dear.

38:46.068 --> 38:50.040
Not sanctuary, but a substantial
inheritance,

38:50.040 --> 38:55.056
which, given Patrick's fragile
heart, could've come at any time.

38:55.056 --> 38:57.008
Inheritance?

38:57.008 --> 39:01.092
As you well know, a bigamist's
will is null and void

39:01.092 --> 39:03.096
when the crime is exposed.

39:03.096 --> 39:06.048
I don't care about Patrick's money.

39:07.056 --> 39:10.024
You have a very expensive taste
in jewellery.

39:10.024 --> 39:14.060
This is outrageous!
May I ask what's in your bag?

39:14.060 --> 39:17.064
That's got nothing to do with you.

39:17.064 --> 39:19.020
George...

39:19.020 --> 39:21.016
George!

39:21.016 --> 39:23.096
You stupid boy!

39:23.096 --> 39:26.000
A train ticket.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.056
To London.

39:28.072 --> 39:31.004
You were going to abandon me.

39:31.004 --> 39:35.084
I'm afraid that Maria has taken
advantage of your affection for her.

39:36.096 --> 39:40.024
You said this was to keep me
out of care.

39:40.024 --> 39:42.004
You told me you loved me.

39:44.008 --> 39:46.024
Oh, God.

39:46.024 --> 39:48.048
What've I done?Stop the bus!

39:48.048 --> 39:50.064
Drive on, Eric!
Stop this bus at once!

39:52.060 --> 39:54.044
I order you to open this door!

39:54.044 --> 39:58.016
This bus now terminates
at the police station.

39:58.016 --> 40:01.064
Before this bus reaches
its final destination,

40:01.064 --> 40:06.012
I urge you, for the sake
of your mortal souls, to repent.

40:26.076 --> 40:28.024
Inspector Mallory!

40:30.044 --> 40:31.072
Thank you, Eric.

40:31.072 --> 40:33.052
What in the blazes is...?

40:33.052 --> 40:37.028
Padre.You can let Eddie Trist
go, Inspector.

40:37.028 --> 40:38.084
Oh, can I?

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
I gave Angelica the cyanide,
in a wineglass.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.024
Sorry, sonny. Eddie Trist did it.
We found poison in his shed.

40:49.024 --> 40:52.040
In a jar on his workbench. Yes.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.036
I put it there.

40:56.048 --> 40:58.044
That's where Maria
told me to put it.

41:00.020 --> 41:03.072
I'll take him inside, Sir.
Come on, son.

41:06.016 --> 41:09.032
You may have to work a bit harder
with his accomplice, Inspector.

41:35.016 --> 41:37.096
Unusually thoughtful
of Inspector Mallory to allow them

41:37.096 --> 41:41.064
to pray together at St Mary's
before he goes.

41:41.064 --> 41:44.060
I wonder if Patrick will survive
seven years in prison.

41:44.060 --> 41:51.032
If he does, I suspect Francesca will
be waiting for him at the gates.

41:51.032 --> 41:53.028
Hasn't the poor woman
suffered enough?

41:56.040 --> 42:01.012
'Love bears all things,
love believes all things,

42:01.012 --> 42:05.040
'love hopes all things,
love endures all things.'

42:05.040 --> 42:06.080
'Love never fails.'

42:16.096 --> 42:20.096
So, how did you know which bus those
two were going to take, Father?

42:20.096 --> 42:25.072
I saw George looking at a Kembleford
to Cirencester timetable

42:25.072 --> 42:29.068
in the Post Office.
You really are far too clever!

42:32.032 --> 42:34.044
Cheer up, Mrs M.

42:34.044 --> 42:38.040
Not every man you're keen on
will turn out to be a bigamist.

42:38.040 --> 42:41.004
You sound awfully
certain about that.

42:41.004 --> 42:43.056
If it's any consolation,
I don't think I could ever get used

42:43.056 --> 42:46.072
to calling you Mrs O, Mrs M.
Me neither.

42:46.072 --> 42:48.096
Oh, come on, Mrs M.

42:48.096 --> 42:52.012
Aren't you just a tiny bit flattered
that Patrick went for you

42:52.012 --> 42:53.064
rather than another younger model?

42:53.064 --> 42:56.032
No, I am not.
