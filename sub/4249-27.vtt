21:54.479 --> 21:56.690
- YOU DID?
WHERE?

21:56.773 --> 21:58.692
- IN THE WARDROBE.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.110
- [sighs]

22:00.193 --> 22:01.862
COME ON, ALFIE.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.072
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.200
[gasps]

22:07.284 --> 22:08.785
ALFIE?

22:08.869 --> 22:13.415
[baby coos]

22:13.498 --> 22:13.999
ALFIE?

22:14.082 --> 22:15.876
[baby squeals]
