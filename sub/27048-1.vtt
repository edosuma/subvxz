00:21.662 --> 00:22.497
Dick!

00:50.189 --> 00:50.991
Tom!

01:44.877 --> 01:46.546
Kane did find it.

01:51.651 --> 01:53.387
The stories are true.

01:55.222 --> 01:56.023
It killed him.

01:58.192 --> 01:58.993
Doesn't matter.

02:02.595 --> 02:04.564
Just wanna get the
hell off this island.

02:10.470 --> 02:11.635
It's going to work

02:11.637 --> 02:12.539
quite well.

02:13.873 --> 02:17.177
Hey, well done, boys.

02:22.815 --> 02:24.782
Ah, it's good to be home.

02:24.784 --> 02:26.884
Some outdoorsman you are.

02:26.886 --> 02:29.520
You can't get premium
scotch outdoors.

02:29.522 --> 02:30.357
So what's next?

02:31.224 --> 02:32.990
What about The Congo?

02:32.992 --> 02:35.329
There's a place with a
Zaire River raft.

02:36.563 --> 02:38.065
Too fuckin' hot.

02:39.065 --> 02:42.000
Besides, we did that last month.

02:42.002 --> 02:43.204
We could go to Jersey.

02:44.104 --> 02:45.836
What's in Jersey?

02:45.838 --> 02:46.837
My ex-wife.

03:10.563 --> 03:11.496
Francine.

03:11.498 --> 03:12.297
Hello, Ryan.

03:12.299 --> 03:13.801
So good to see you.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.533
Where's...

03:15.535 --> 03:17.835
I need to talk to you.

03:18.838 --> 03:19.740
Everything okay?

03:21.275 --> 03:23.008
I have to talk to you.

03:23.010 --> 03:23.845
Of course.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.819
What's going on?

03:35.821 --> 03:36.790
It's Dylan.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.228
He's missing.

03:41.628 --> 03:43.328
How long's he been gone for?

03:43.330 --> 03:44.464
Three weeks now.

03:46.732 --> 03:49.434
You don't think he's
still on vacation?

03:49.436 --> 03:52.039
He always sends me letters
when he's on his hunts.

03:53.307 --> 03:54.242
They've stopped.

03:56.809 --> 03:59.112
Have you tried
contacting the police?

04:00.546 --> 04:03.048
They could get out a
search party or something.

04:03.050 --> 04:04.485
No, I can't do that.

04:05.718 --> 04:07.988
Dylan's reputation is
too important to him.

04:09.222 --> 04:11.124
He'd kill me if I
called the police.

04:13.026 --> 04:15.293
Francine, we don't have a
whole lot of options here.

04:15.295 --> 04:16.827
No.

04:16.829 --> 04:19.130
Ryan, you're my only option.

04:19.132 --> 04:22.603
You and the other hunters and
trackers that Dylan taught,

04:23.770 --> 04:26.470
you could find him
and bring him back.

04:26.472 --> 04:27.307
Francine.

04:28.775 --> 04:31.912
We all know that a search
party will take days.

04:33.145 --> 04:34.714
You can find him in no time.

04:41.053 --> 04:42.756
What does Gail
think about this?

04:44.024 --> 04:46.023
Well, she's upset.

04:46.025 --> 04:47.559
You know how she is.

04:47.561 --> 04:50.031
She stormed out of my
house when I told her.

04:50.964 --> 04:51.866
She's in town?

04:52.965 --> 04:55.066
She
didn't tell you?

04:55.068 --> 04:56.469
She's been back a week now.

05:02.875 --> 05:03.710
Where'd he go?

05:05.912 --> 05:08.282
He said an island
northeast of here.

05:13.253 --> 05:14.318
The Island of Hobbes?

05:14.320 --> 05:15.255
You know it?

05:16.356 --> 05:17.789
Yeah.

05:17.791 --> 05:21.729
He's been wanting to go there
to disprove the monster.

05:22.863 --> 05:26.133
Ryan, he's been
acting strange lately.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.103
He said he wanted a challenge.

05:31.404 --> 05:34.008
I'm afraid he might've
taken something too far.

05:35.041 --> 05:35.875
Okay.

05:37.644 --> 05:39.309
I'll talk to the guys tonight.

05:39.311 --> 05:40.814
Oh thank you, Ryan.

05:44.417 --> 05:45.418
This means a lot,

05:46.286 --> 05:47.121
and please,

05:48.722 --> 05:50.091
don't let Gail go.

05:51.924 --> 05:54.327
Don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

06:55.121 --> 06:56.888
How long's he been gone for?

06:56.890 --> 06:58.192
I've hardly noticed.

06:59.459 --> 07:01.458
He's been on plenty
of these long trips before.

07:01.460 --> 07:04.097
How do we know he's
not just taking his time?

07:05.498 --> 07:06.666
Been writing letters.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.103
A few weeks ago they stopped.

07:11.270 --> 07:13.470
Maybe he doesn't
wanna be found.

07:13.472 --> 07:17.377
So wait, if he's missing why
not just sent a search party?

07:19.212 --> 07:20.611
Unfortunately we can't-

07:26.186 --> 07:27.020
do that.

07:32.058 --> 07:34.659
A man who spends the
majority of his life outdoors.

07:34.661 --> 07:36.063
Is lost.

07:37.964 --> 07:42.633
Yeah, not to mention the
reputation of the lodge.

07:42.635 --> 07:44.169
And that's where we come in?

07:44.171 --> 07:45.406
Right.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.176
With your help we can find him.

07:51.844 --> 07:54.011
When are we planning on going?

07:54.013 --> 07:55.181
First light tomorrow.

07:56.082 --> 07:57.418
His last known location.

07:58.818 --> 08:00.220
And where is that exactly?

08:01.453 --> 08:02.522
Island of Hobbes.

08:10.197 --> 08:12.266
It's a hell of a place.

08:13.265 --> 08:18.270
It's where he went.

08:21.340 --> 08:25.545
Look, let's not forget
who Kane is to this lodge

08:26.546 --> 08:27.681
and to every one of us.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.819
This guy taught us
everything we know.

08:34.221 --> 08:35.188
So I'll say again,

08:37.323 --> 08:38.159
who's with me?

08:47.299 --> 08:48.101
Yeah.

08:50.236 --> 08:51.070
All right.

08:52.905 --> 08:53.741
I'm in.

09:04.885 --> 09:06.417
All right.

09:06.419 --> 09:09.423
Meet at Wayne County Airport
at eight a.m. tomorrow.

09:11.857 --> 09:12.693
See ya then.

09:24.770 --> 09:27.073
You know as well as I do
Kane doesn't just go missing.

09:31.010 --> 09:33.011
I know.

09:33.013 --> 09:35.015
See ya in the morning.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.356
Take care of him, all right?

10:00.206 --> 10:02.941
What are you doin' here?

10:02.943 --> 10:04.274
It's been awhile.

10:04.276 --> 10:07.448
I just wanted to see the lodge.

10:09.683 --> 10:11.318
It's good to see
you again, Ryan.

10:13.886 --> 10:15.485
Yeah, we, uh...

10:15.487 --> 10:17.590
You wanna get a drink?

10:19.125 --> 10:19.927
Catch up?

10:24.630 --> 10:26.332
I'm actually
heading downstairs.

10:29.401 --> 10:30.335
Yeah.

10:30.337 --> 10:31.538
Mind if I come down with you?

10:33.073 --> 10:34.275
Just like old times.

10:46.119 --> 10:48.589
The others, what about them?

10:53.893 --> 10:56.463
Cold'll preserve their
bodies 'til we get back.

10:58.865 --> 10:59.832
And Peter?

11:03.068 --> 11:05.003
He's still out there.

11:05.005 --> 11:06.039
He's been dead.

11:09.141 --> 11:10.340
And we will be, too, if we don't

11:10.342 --> 11:11.945
get off this God
forsaken island.

11:13.947 --> 11:15.316
How do expect to leave?

11:18.351 --> 11:19.852
We don't have
any other options.

11:23.323 --> 11:24.455
Get some rest.

11:24.457 --> 11:25.558
I'll take first watch.

11:39.872 --> 11:42.508
Nice to see you kept
this place mostly intact.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.919
How long has it been now?

11:53.053 --> 11:53.854
Two years?

11:55.889 --> 11:56.690
Four.

11:58.024 --> 11:58.826
Wow.

12:00.526 --> 12:02.428
What've you been up to?

12:03.862 --> 12:04.829
Traveling.

12:04.831 --> 12:05.499
Just got back from Greece.

12:06.632 --> 12:07.433
You?

12:08.834 --> 12:10.670
You're lookin' at it.

12:22.148 --> 12:24.284
Oh my God, is that
the trip to The Congo?

12:33.393 --> 12:35.696
Gosh, remember that
gamble you had with Dad?

12:38.030 --> 12:40.998
Three years, I'm still
payin' that debt off.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.835
Yeah.

12:43.837 --> 12:45.369
Guess that's what
happens when you challenge

12:45.371 --> 12:47.404
the world's greatest
hunter, huh?

12:47.406 --> 12:49.609
He always
liked his challenges.

12:51.544 --> 12:52.346
He does.

12:56.182 --> 12:58.919
Especially when trying to
prove to superstitious locals

13:00.053 --> 13:01.621
that a stupid legend
doesn't exist.

13:03.088 --> 13:05.858
That is a challenge.

13:06.860 --> 13:09.962
Yeah, on his adventures.

13:10.829 --> 13:12.098
So what was it this time?

13:14.567 --> 13:19.573
Some Indian legend about an
island haunted by a monster,

13:21.908 --> 13:23.243
thirst for man flesh.

13:24.276 --> 13:26.145
Ah, the Beast of Hobbes.

13:27.413 --> 13:29.216
He would tell me
that one as a girl.

13:30.283 --> 13:31.849
When I'd misbehave he'd tell me

13:31.851 --> 13:34.354
that the beast would
come and scalp me.

13:36.222 --> 13:37.591
You believed that?

13:38.558 --> 13:39.393
I was six.

13:40.459 --> 13:44.030
You've been to every vacation

13:48.101 --> 13:49.470
and every family trip,

13:52.871 --> 13:55.409
did he ever mention me at all?

13:56.943 --> 13:57.778
All the time.

13:59.545 --> 14:01.147
Mostly about us getting hitched.

14:02.182 --> 14:03.413
Yeah.

14:03.415 --> 14:05.251
The look on his face
when we called it off.

14:07.819 --> 14:09.722
Well, you were
always his favorite.

14:11.790 --> 14:14.292
Come on, don't say that.

14:14.294 --> 14:16.259
We both know he
wanted a son and you fit

14:16.261 --> 14:17.494
- the description perfectly.
- Come on.

14:17.496 --> 14:19.198
He took you with us, didn't he?

14:22.935 --> 14:23.803
He loves you.

14:48.327 --> 14:50.795
Bagged him in
Yosemite last month.

14:50.797 --> 14:51.965
Quite the specimen.

15:03.476 --> 15:06.877
Didn't go down
without a fight either.

15:06.879 --> 15:08.682
Kind of reminded
me of you actually.

15:12.919 --> 15:15.989
Ryan, take me with you.

15:16.923 --> 15:17.758
Please.

15:18.625 --> 15:19.525
Please.

15:21.794 --> 15:23.960
He's my father, I need to know.

15:23.962 --> 15:27.531
And he'll kill me for
having you come to his rescue.

15:27.533 --> 15:28.999
I'm not a little girl anymore.

15:29.001 --> 15:31.201
I do not have to
submit to his pride.

15:31.203 --> 15:36.209
It's about all he has left.

15:45.684 --> 15:47.186
Is this the only
reason you came?

16:02.235 --> 16:03.036
Fine.

16:14.947 --> 16:19.452
When he tears me a new one,
you better take the blame.

16:20.419 --> 16:21.520
Just like old times.

16:23.489 --> 16:24.324
Right.

16:48.380 --> 16:49.547
Hello?

16:49.549 --> 16:51.315
Mornin', sweetheart.

16:51.317 --> 16:52.215
Ryan?

16:52.217 --> 16:53.383
Wanted to wake you,

16:53.385 --> 16:54.951
but I figured you needed
some beauty sleep.

16:54.953 --> 16:56.423
Get back here now.

16:57.823 --> 17:00.459
Look, I got a flight to catch.

17:02.327 --> 17:05.994
Don't worry, cleaning
lady'll be downstairs soon.

17:05.997 --> 17:07.430
What?

17:07.432 --> 17:09.233
She knows where the key is.

17:09.234 --> 17:10.069
Ryan.

17:11.470 --> 17:14.405
Yeah, this isn't the first
time this has happened.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.242
Ryan!

17:16.342 --> 17:17.840
Sorry, that's my flight.

17:17.843 --> 17:19.709
Gotta go, see ya in a week.

17:19.711 --> 17:20.546
Ryan!

17:27.252 --> 17:28.218
Mornin', gentlemen.

17:28.220 --> 17:29.887
Mornin'.

17:29.889 --> 17:31.688
How can I help?

17:31.690 --> 17:34.090
Didn't happen to rent
a boat couple weeks back,

17:34.092 --> 17:35.062
older gentleman?

17:37.397 --> 17:39.029
Dylan Kane?

17:39.031 --> 17:40.263
Tall, older?

17:40.265 --> 17:42.832
Oh, I remember he
come through here.

17:42.834 --> 17:45.639
I didn't have any boats for
him so I pointed him to Joe.

17:47.305 --> 17:48.773
Who's Joe?

17:48.775 --> 17:50.808
He's a local fisherman,
kind of a strange type

17:50.810 --> 17:51.678
if ya ask me.

17:52.978 --> 17:54.046
You know
where we can find him?

17:55.648 --> 17:56.483
I don't know.

17:57.417 --> 17:58.851
I ain't seen him since.

18:01.420 --> 18:04.824
Well, like to rent a couple
of your boats for the day.

18:05.957 --> 18:07.724
Doin' some fishin'?

18:07.726 --> 18:08.562
No.

18:10.696 --> 18:11.965
We're headin' to The Isle.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.103
Now why in the world
do you wanna go there?

18:18.103 --> 18:20.471
Lookin' for our friend.

18:20.473 --> 18:23.541
Well, if he went there
he ain't comin' back.

18:23.543 --> 18:24.378
Why is that?

18:25.945 --> 18:28.611
It's a dark place.

18:28.613 --> 18:30.981
Why do you think no
one lives on there?

18:30.983 --> 18:33.583
No one even fishes
near The Isle.

18:33.585 --> 18:34.387
Cursed?

18:35.588 --> 18:38.589
You never heard of
the Beast of Hobbes?

18:38.591 --> 18:39.723
Sure.

18:39.725 --> 18:41.192
You believe in stories?

18:41.194 --> 18:42.062
It's real.

18:42.995 --> 18:44.997
Fishermen see him all the time.

18:46.431 --> 18:48.534
How can they see him if
no one goes near the island?

18:49.869 --> 18:52.572
Look, just don't go out there.

18:54.573 --> 18:58.609
Beast or not, I'd like to
rent a couple of your boats.

18:58.611 --> 18:59.713
You gonna help us out?

19:00.947 --> 19:02.681
Well I'm afraid
I can't help you.

19:03.615 --> 19:05.217
I can't let you go out there

19:06.819 --> 19:08.522
knowin' I won't
get my boats back.

19:11.490 --> 19:12.992
How much is this gonna take?

19:17.630 --> 19:19.463
How many'd you say you need?

19:19.465 --> 19:20.300
Just two.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.041
So that's the
Island of Hobbes, huh?

19:30.208 --> 19:32.245
Why the hell'd the old
bastard come out here?

19:33.678 --> 19:35.346
He was after the
Beast of Hobbes.

19:35.348 --> 19:36.513
Really?

19:36.515 --> 19:38.651
The old man after
a ghost story?

19:42.921 --> 19:45.257
Why hasn't he come back yet?

20:19.292 --> 20:22.462
Shouldn't
you get some sleep?

20:26.565 --> 20:27.400
Can't.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.611
Cheerful spot, isn't it?

20:47.119 --> 20:47.920
Now what?

20:54.060 --> 20:55.996
We'll head north
on the eastern shore,

20:57.228 --> 20:58.931
then head south on
the western side.

21:00.332 --> 21:01.668
It's 96 square miles.

21:03.502 --> 21:05.071
Still 12 hours of daylight left.

21:06.671 --> 21:07.908
Lot of ground to cover.

21:09.074 --> 21:10.442
Had better get to it, then.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.731
It's so bloody thick

21:33.733 --> 21:36.069
I can barely see 20
feet in front of me.

21:37.637 --> 21:39.505
Reminds me of the Flatheads.

21:40.706 --> 21:42.409
At least it wasn't
as cold down there.

21:54.887 --> 21:56.590
Hey, you all right?

22:01.494 --> 22:03.897
Don't tell me
you're gettin' jumpy.

22:05.831 --> 22:07.231
Better to be on your toes.

22:07.233 --> 22:10.033
Wolves hunt all up
and down this island.

22:10.035 --> 22:11.036
Moose out here, too.

22:11.970 --> 22:12.805
Moose?

22:13.973 --> 22:15.571
Once saw this man get
near trampled to death

22:15.573 --> 22:17.409
by a moose up near Fairbanks.

22:18.811 --> 22:21.512
Guy has to drink his meals
through a rubber hose.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.381
Christ.

22:23.716 --> 22:25.381
Well this keeps gettin'
better and better.

22:32.858 --> 22:33.693
You hear that?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.092
What?

22:36.094 --> 22:36.929
Nothin'.

22:37.830 --> 22:38.665
It's quiet.

22:39.564 --> 22:40.400
So?

22:43.535 --> 22:45.769
Been like that
since we got here.

22:45.771 --> 22:48.638
Maybe the Beast
of Hobbes is nearby.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.310
How much ground
have we covered?

22:51.744 --> 22:53.377
About eight miles.

22:53.379 --> 22:54.945
Eight miles?

22:54.947 --> 22:57.246
I thought it'd at least be 10.

22:57.248 --> 22:58.083
What's that?

23:21.940 --> 23:23.409
What do you think they are?

23:25.044 --> 23:26.545
Who cares, just keep movin'.

23:28.046 --> 23:29.582
Who do you think did this?

23:32.016 --> 23:34.787
Probably some kids
tryin' to keep the legend alive.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.323
And these are
part of the legend?

23:39.525 --> 23:41.558
Crafts the woods to
trap the souls of men

23:41.560 --> 23:42.996
that he has killed.

23:44.563 --> 23:45.899
Thanks
for that, Leonard.

24:08.521 --> 24:10.457
Hold up, I gotta stop.

24:12.658 --> 24:13.493
Why?

24:15.160 --> 24:15.995
I gotta go.

24:17.729 --> 24:18.564
Find a tree.

24:20.966 --> 24:22.401
Not that kind of go.

24:26.906 --> 24:27.704
Take a break.

24:27.706 --> 24:28.541
Hurry it up.

25:02.908 --> 25:03.743
Hello?

25:16.255 --> 25:17.090
Hello?

25:31.704 --> 25:32.539
Seriously.

25:33.505 --> 25:34.340
Al?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.072
Is that you?

25:52.323 --> 25:54.323
Where the hell is he?

25:54.325 --> 25:55.591
He had to go.

25:55.593 --> 25:56.696
15 minutes?

26:00.232 --> 26:03.065
Howard, go find him.

26:03.067 --> 26:03.902
Why me?

26:05.036 --> 26:06.605
Oh fuck it, I'll go.

26:29.428 --> 26:32.265
Why would he
leave his backpack?

26:33.465 --> 26:35.802
Dumb fuck must've got
turned around in here.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.075
Peter!

26:46.344 --> 26:47.179
Peter!

26:48.913 --> 26:50.349
Peter!

26:51.316 --> 26:52.718
Peter!

27:00.758 --> 27:03.193
I'm sorry for earlier.

27:03.195 --> 27:04.226
I was just...

27:04.228 --> 27:05.631
You were right.

27:09.802 --> 27:12.170
I should've come here sooner.

27:13.237 --> 27:14.740
You didn't know.

27:17.008 --> 27:19.309
None of this is your fault.

27:27.151 --> 27:28.654
Peter!

27:31.622 --> 27:32.457
Peter!

27:34.892 --> 27:36.994
This is ridiculous.

27:36.996 --> 27:38.063
Where the hell is he?

27:40.631 --> 27:42.866
It's been over
a bloody hour now

27:42.868 --> 27:44.437
and still no sign of him.

27:46.338 --> 27:47.571
I was right.

27:47.573 --> 27:49.042
We gotta get the
hell out of here.

27:50.208 --> 27:51.608
And just leave him out here?

27:51.610 --> 27:53.109
He's fine.

27:53.111 --> 27:56.114
When he lost us, he probably
went back to the fucking boats.

27:58.283 --> 27:59.118
He's right.

28:01.186 --> 28:03.622
He's got his survival
skills like the rest of us.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.423
He'll be fine.

28:06.425 --> 28:08.257
Hey, fellas!

28:18.836 --> 28:19.671
They're tracks.

28:23.108 --> 28:23.943
Well?

28:25.878 --> 28:26.713
Peter?

28:28.080 --> 28:32.249
Can't be, these tracks
are at least a day old.

28:32.251 --> 28:33.119
Is it Kane's?

28:36.287 --> 28:37.553
Hard to tell.

28:37.555 --> 28:38.557
They're goin' north.

28:39.525 --> 28:40.360
Let's move.

29:22.868 --> 29:25.438
What the hell is that?

29:30.441 --> 29:32.007
It's
too hard to tell.

29:32.009 --> 29:33.178
The tracks are too old.

29:50.195 --> 29:51.030
Guys.

30:18.890 --> 30:20.558
What the
hell happened here?

30:23.629 --> 30:24.897
Who could've done this?

30:26.230 --> 30:28.100
Looks like some
sort of last stand.

30:28.967 --> 30:29.869
Against what?

30:46.450 --> 30:47.719
What, is it Kane?

30:48.687 --> 30:49.455
No.

30:50.488 --> 30:51.857
It's Joe the fisherman.

30:53.225 --> 30:54.226
Then where's Kane?

30:58.429 --> 31:03.401
Here.

31:29.328 --> 31:31.564
Oh God, look at him.

31:33.497 --> 31:34.734
What could've done that?

31:37.069 --> 31:37.904
Wolves?

31:39.670 --> 31:40.505
No.

31:42.474 --> 31:43.476
Then what?

31:45.009 --> 31:46.278
I don't know.

31:49.313 --> 31:51.117
What would just
rip him up like that?

31:53.552 --> 31:54.920
Cover him for Christ's sake.

32:13.338 --> 32:17.206
It was stupid of him to
come out here without us.

32:17.208 --> 32:18.744
What could've
done that to him?

32:22.747 --> 32:25.348
You get that feelin', too?

32:25.350 --> 32:27.419
Yeah, since we got to shore.

32:29.955 --> 32:31.823
I need a bloody breather.

32:33.257 --> 32:34.092
Take five.

32:39.264 --> 32:40.131
So what's next?

32:48.473 --> 32:52.645
When we get back we'll
give him a proper burial.

32:54.045 --> 32:56.582
He shouldn't have come
out here in the first place.

33:24.242 --> 33:25.077
Howard.

33:33.517 --> 33:34.319
What is it?

33:45.630 --> 33:46.732
It's Peter.

33:50.901 --> 33:51.736
Help!

34:00.411 --> 34:01.878
What the hell happened?

34:01.880 --> 34:03.114
Is he breathing?

34:09.652 --> 34:10.722
I can't see.

34:29.672 --> 34:31.507
Do something.

34:31.510 --> 34:32.507
Do something!

34:32.510 --> 34:33.344
Howard!

34:40.717 --> 34:41.652
What happened?

34:48.427 --> 34:49.260
Tom.

34:52.197 --> 34:54.166
He stepped and it
came outta nowhere.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.747
What the hell is that?

35:10.749 --> 35:11.817
It's a trip wire.

35:13.751 --> 35:15.487
He used
Peter's hat as bait.

35:16.921 --> 35:19.488
There's no one else out
here that coulda done that.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.529
What the hell was that?

35:26.465 --> 35:27.296
Come on, pick him up.

35:27.298 --> 35:28.731
Let's get outta here.

35:28.733 --> 35:31.066
We only brought
the one stretcher.

35:31.068 --> 35:32.202
Well what do we do?

35:32.204 --> 35:33.602
We can't carry them both.

35:33.604 --> 35:35.905
Well we can't just
leave him out here.

35:35.907 --> 35:36.709
We won't.

35:37.709 --> 35:38.511
We take Kane.

35:41.445 --> 35:44.749
We'll leave his body by the
boats, come back for Howard.

35:45.684 --> 35:47.216
You're kidding, right?

35:47.218 --> 35:50.954
What if the same thing
that found Kane finds him?

35:50.956 --> 35:52.588
We don't have a choice.

35:52.590 --> 35:53.957
We're not too far off.

35:53.959 --> 35:54.960
We'll make it quick.

35:59.530 --> 36:01.400
Tom, make a mark.

36:04.436 --> 36:07.437
We have about three
hours of daylight left

36:07.439 --> 36:10.643
and it's only gonna get colder.

36:25.724 --> 36:28.227
All of this is my fault.

36:49.146 --> 36:50.282
It wasn't your fault.

36:51.316 --> 36:55.551
Yeah, I know.

36:55.553 --> 36:57.289
That was an Apache design.

36:58.657 --> 37:00.155
I know.

37:00.157 --> 37:02.360
Not a whole lot of
people know how to do that.

37:05.130 --> 37:07.430
Was it an old trap of Kane's?

37:07.432 --> 37:08.830
Couldn't have been.

37:08.832 --> 37:10.369
Used Peter's hat to lure us in.

37:11.735 --> 37:13.972
Not to mention it was
set for a man's height.

37:15.974 --> 37:18.244
Why would Kane be
setting a trap for a man?

37:19.343 --> 37:20.845
Maybe he was
using it against us?

37:37.928 --> 37:40.195
You son of a bitch.

37:40.197 --> 37:41.263
How dare you!

37:41.265 --> 37:42.064
- Gail.
- First you chain me

37:42.066 --> 37:43.499
to your bed half naked.

37:43.501 --> 37:45.001
Gail!

37:45.003 --> 37:46.769
And then you make me fly
out here all by myself.

37:46.771 --> 37:51.776
Can it wait?

37:55.412 --> 37:57.046
Gail.

37:57.048 --> 37:57.883
Hold her.

38:17.769 --> 38:20.035
We have to wait.

38:20.037 --> 38:21.806
Wait for his voice.

38:30.749 --> 38:31.917
Gail.

38:33.284 --> 38:34.117
Leave me alone.

38:34.119 --> 38:36.521
Just fuck off.

38:39.157 --> 38:40.455
Gail.

38:42.427 --> 38:43.262
Gail.

38:45.963 --> 38:47.930
How could this happen?

38:47.932 --> 38:48.798
Oh shit.

38:48.800 --> 38:51.100
Don't know.

38:51.102 --> 38:51.937
You don't know?

38:53.838 --> 38:55.405
Just fix it, just
fucking fix it.

38:55.407 --> 38:56.738
We gotta get
back to the others.

38:56.740 --> 38:57.573
No!

38:57.575 --> 38:59.008
Just...

39:16.561 --> 39:17.896
We need to go.

39:19.963 --> 39:21.698
Peter's missing.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.668
Howard's dead.

39:24.535 --> 39:25.970
We need to get back to shore.

39:37.247 --> 39:39.351
This is all your fault.

40:07.311 --> 40:09.313
We're losin' daylight.

40:16.820 --> 40:18.423
Tom, give me a hand with this.

40:20.023 --> 40:22.827
Let's get going.

40:24.595 --> 40:25.660
Dick!

41:22.387 --> 41:23.322
It scalped him.

41:27.090 --> 41:28.159
What do we do?

41:30.595 --> 41:31.563
Cut him down.

41:35.767 --> 41:36.602
Tom!

42:32.155 --> 42:33.289
Aw geez.

42:33.291 --> 42:34.124
What was it?

42:37.195 --> 42:38.030
George!

42:38.963 --> 42:41.229
I don't know.

42:41.231 --> 42:43.235
I don't know what I saw.

42:47.505 --> 42:50.008
How the hell did he get
to Dick and Tom so fast?

43:00.885 --> 43:02.053
Let's get out of here.

43:03.655 --> 43:05.023
We can't leave the bodies.

43:06.490 --> 43:07.555
Screw them!

43:07.557 --> 43:09.293
We can't just leave 'em here.

43:11.028 --> 43:13.396
Who the hell cares?

43:13.398 --> 43:14.497
They're dead.

43:14.499 --> 43:16.532
Leave the bodies!

43:16.534 --> 43:18.035
We aren't leaving my father.

43:19.169 --> 43:20.970
Everyone calm down.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.039
Calm?

43:24.041 --> 43:26.142
You want me to
fucking calm down?

43:26.144 --> 43:27.979
We'll be killed
one by fucking one!

43:29.046 --> 43:30.780
It shouldn't be a discussion!

43:30.782 --> 43:32.450
- Al!
- No you can't!

43:34.686 --> 43:35.751
Get off me.

43:38.822 --> 43:40.756
This is not about
you, Al, right now.

43:40.758 --> 43:41.593
Okay?

43:42.994 --> 43:44.662
I suppose it's
about you, then.

43:46.097 --> 43:46.928
It's not about me either.

43:46.930 --> 43:48.129
It's about all of us.

43:48.131 --> 43:50.332
Your father and your
whole damn family.

43:50.334 --> 43:53.401
Don't bring
my father into this.

43:53.403 --> 43:55.137
Ever since I...

44:06.150 --> 44:07.985
Same thing that made
the tracks with Kane.

44:10.787 --> 44:11.622
What is this?

44:14.925 --> 44:15.760
Toes.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.368
It has feet.

44:24.369 --> 44:25.303
It's a man.

44:26.704 --> 44:28.403
Stride's too long.

44:28.405 --> 44:29.707
It's too fast to be a man.

44:40.218 --> 44:41.617
What the
hell are you doing?

44:41.619 --> 44:43.285
Let's get back to the fucking
boats like normal people

44:43.287 --> 44:44.120
- and get off this island!
- Just stop.

44:44.122 --> 44:45.057
Shut the fuck up.

44:49.427 --> 44:50.262
George,

44:52.497 --> 44:53.865
Do you know what you saw?

44:57.901 --> 44:59.104
Couldn't see its face.

45:00.938 --> 45:02.340
It was standing on two legs.

45:04.374 --> 45:05.209
It had fur,

45:07.044 --> 45:07.878
horns.

45:20.258 --> 45:21.259
That's it.

45:22.727 --> 45:23.562
That's it.

45:28.331 --> 45:31.666
Let's at least
grab Kane's body.

45:31.668 --> 45:33.535
Let's grab the
stretcher and head back.

45:33.537 --> 45:35.006
What about the others?

45:37.974 --> 45:39.477
We'll come back.

45:41.311 --> 45:42.646
Let's get going.

46:00.631 --> 46:01.700
I'll come.

46:02.733 --> 46:04.432
Just go.

46:04.434 --> 46:06.637
I'll come, just fucking go.

47:06.430 --> 47:07.997
It's a man doing this.

47:07.999 --> 47:09.568
It's not a man.

47:10.735 --> 47:12.771
Animals don't set
traps or scalp people.

47:14.539 --> 47:15.407
It's not a man.

47:16.706 --> 47:18.474
This thing's big.

47:18.476 --> 47:21.278
It's got thick black hair,
bones coverin' its face.

47:22.613 --> 47:26.184
We're not dealing with
anything human here.

47:31.222 --> 47:36.227
What the hell is that?

47:49.506 --> 47:51.941
Is that smoke?

47:51.943 --> 47:52.776
Fire!

48:23.740 --> 48:26.809
Your father,

48:26.811 --> 48:28.910
Tom,

48:28.912 --> 48:30.111
Dick.

48:30.113 --> 48:35.086
Ryan, you should
really get some sleep.

48:37.655 --> 48:41.856
I'm not letting
anyone else go, Gail.

48:41.858 --> 48:43.425
Depriving
yourself of sleep

48:43.427 --> 48:46.195
isn't gonna help anything.

48:46.197 --> 48:48.963
You need to be alert tomorrow.

48:48.965 --> 48:53.202
Like I was today?

48:53.204 --> 48:56.137
Tomorrow will be different.

49:11.521 --> 49:13.588
It burned the boats.

49:13.590 --> 49:15.291
What do we do now?

49:15.293 --> 49:16.695
We just fucking swim for it.

49:17.994 --> 49:20.329
It's near freezing out here.

49:20.331 --> 49:22.898
You wouldn't even
last five minutes.

49:22.900 --> 49:26.238
We aren't going
back into that forest.

49:27.371 --> 49:29.972
Gail, where's your boat?

49:29.974 --> 49:31.240
I don't have one.

49:31.242 --> 49:35.276
I got a local fisherman
to drop me off.

49:35.278 --> 49:37.548
Great, that's just great.

49:41.852 --> 49:43.952
We'll camp here.

49:43.954 --> 49:45.521
Wait until morning so we can...

49:45.523 --> 49:47.388
Brilliant plan, Ryan.

49:47.390 --> 49:49.191
Why don't we ring the
goddamn dinner bell

49:49.193 --> 49:50.695
while we're at it?

49:51.561 --> 49:54.095
You have a better plan, Al?

49:54.097 --> 49:55.863
We should move back
into the treeline.

49:55.865 --> 49:58.066
We're too open out here.

49:58.068 --> 49:59.767
- What?
- Leonard's right.

49:59.769 --> 50:01.303
This thing is hunting us.

50:01.305 --> 50:04.409
We have to start
thinking preventive.

50:05.343 --> 50:07.343
Okay.

50:07.345 --> 50:10.979
Then we move back into
the woods, set up camp,

50:10.981 --> 50:12.584
wait out the night.

50:44.347 --> 50:45.916
Kane did find it.

50:50.921 --> 50:52.657
The stories are true.

50:54.992 --> 50:56.127
It killed him.

50:57.927 --> 50:59.330
Doesn't matter.

51:02.133 --> 51:05.370
Just gotta get the
hell off this island.

51:06.803 --> 51:09.273
The others, what about them?

51:15.345 --> 51:19.580
Cold'll preserve their
bodies 'til we get back.

51:19.582 --> 51:20.584
And Peter?

51:23.921 --> 51:26.320
He's still out there.

51:26.322 --> 51:27.725
He's been dead.

51:29.994 --> 51:31.392
And we will be, too, if we don't

51:31.394 --> 51:34.131
get off this God
forsaken island.

51:35.398 --> 51:38.168
And how do you
expect to leave?

51:39.302 --> 51:41.972
I don't have
any other options.

51:44.175 --> 51:45.173
Get some rest.

51:45.175 --> 51:47.411
I'm gonna take first watch.

52:48.271 --> 52:50.607
You should get some sleep.

52:55.979 --> 52:56.814
Can't.

53:08.626 --> 53:10.725
I'm sorry for earlier.

53:10.727 --> 53:11.559
I was just...

53:11.561 --> 53:12.996
You were right.

53:17.568 --> 53:20.635
I should've come here sooner.

53:20.637 --> 53:22.139
You didn't know.

53:24.275 --> 53:26.510
None of this is your fault.

53:29.880 --> 53:32.050
All of this is my fault.

53:36.452 --> 53:37.454
Your father,

53:39.490 --> 53:40.325
Tom,

53:41.559 --> 53:42.758
Dick.

53:42.760 --> 53:46.030
Ryan, you should
really get some sleep.

53:50.066 --> 53:53.338
I'm not letting
anyone else go, Gail.

53:54.537 --> 53:55.836
Depriving
yourself of sleep

53:55.838 --> 53:58.008
isn't gonna help anything.

53:59.075 --> 54:01.443
You need to be alert tomorrow.

54:01.445 --> 54:03.046
Like I was today?

54:05.749 --> 54:07.986
Tomorrow'll be different.

54:21.932 --> 54:22.867
I need you.

54:45.222 --> 54:47.321
Your shift's over.

54:47.323 --> 54:49.256
You should get some sleep.

54:49.258 --> 54:51.660
I'll take it 'til morning.

54:51.662 --> 54:52.497
Go on.

55:17.021 --> 55:18.689
How'd it beat you?

55:52.923 --> 55:54.592
What would Kane do?

56:00.631 --> 56:01.633
He'd hunt back.

57:15.939 --> 57:18.276
Wake George up, would you?

57:19.575 --> 57:24.581
Like now.

57:31.622 --> 57:34.021
We gotta get movin'.

57:34.023 --> 57:34.858
Right.

57:41.932 --> 57:42.767
Get up.

57:46.269 --> 57:47.736
Get up.

57:47.738 --> 57:50.104
Asshole.

57:52.608 --> 57:54.478
Oh God, oh shit.

57:59.883 --> 58:02.517
Someone.

58:02.519 --> 58:04.322
He had to come in
here and kill George.

58:07.323 --> 58:09.693
There's no way it came
in without me knowin'.

58:12.162 --> 58:14.365
It had its chances
with all of us.

58:21.905 --> 58:22.939
Why just him?

58:25.175 --> 58:26.711
Must've wanted him after Tom.

58:28.177 --> 58:29.346
Then why not kill us?

58:31.849 --> 58:33.080
Wouldn't be smart.

58:33.082 --> 58:34.983
Kill us all at once?

58:34.985 --> 58:37.088
That's not what it wants.

58:40.122 --> 58:41.155
Fuck this.

58:41.157 --> 58:41.992
I'm done.

58:42.959 --> 58:44.892
Where are you going?

58:44.894 --> 58:46.827
What does it
look like I'm doing?

58:46.829 --> 58:49.430
You'll die of
hypothermia before 20 feet.

58:49.432 --> 58:50.668
I'll take my chances.

58:52.168 --> 58:53.203
Just stop!

58:59.108 --> 59:00.908
What the hell's
wrong with you?

59:00.910 --> 59:02.146
We stick together.

59:04.146 --> 59:05.713
I'm done.

59:05.715 --> 59:07.916
I'm not going back in
those woods to be hunted.

59:07.918 --> 59:08.753
We're not.

59:11.387 --> 59:12.622
You happen to have a plan?

59:18.061 --> 59:20.298
We're going to hunt back.

59:50.593 --> 59:53.264
What if his plan doesn't work?

59:57.267 --> 59:59.166
We've got to get out of here.

59:59.168 --> 01:00:02.202
We wait here until
Ryan comes back.

01:01:03.133 --> 01:01:04.365
Did you hear that?

01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:05.335
Get ready.

01:01:09.039 --> 01:01:09.840
We have to run.

01:01:11.407 --> 01:01:12.242
Stay.

01:01:58.555 --> 01:01:59.357
Oh shit.

01:02:00.657 --> 01:02:01.459
Jesus.

01:02:02.459 --> 01:02:03.825
What happened?

01:02:03.827 --> 01:02:04.762
I was right in front of it.

01:02:06.496 --> 01:02:07.298
Where's Leonard?

01:02:09.398 --> 01:02:10.631
Al ran off.

01:02:10.633 --> 01:02:12.767
Leonard went off after him.

01:02:12.769 --> 01:02:16.604
Damn it.

01:02:20.843 --> 01:02:21.678
Get up.

01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:48.870
I'm so sorry.

01:02:48.872 --> 01:02:49.704
Shit.

01:02:49.706 --> 01:02:50.671
I'll be okay.

01:02:57.012 --> 01:02:58.412
Shit.

01:02:58.414 --> 01:02:59.249
Oh gosh.

01:03:57.173 --> 01:03:58.007
Dad?

01:04:26.369 --> 01:04:27.204
Run.

01:04:33.343 --> 01:04:34.178
Run!

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:51.394
For God sakes, you're
better than this, Ryan.

01:05:58.994 --> 01:05:59.829
Kane.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.602
You still like rabbit stew?

01:06:09.838 --> 01:06:10.840
What are you doing?

01:06:12.776 --> 01:06:13.611
Dinner.

01:06:17.579 --> 01:06:19.616
All that
time it was you.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:23.052
I saw you at the camp.

01:06:25.387 --> 01:06:27.023
I saw you torn to pieces.

01:06:29.726 --> 01:06:31.695
You're
a clever one, then.

01:06:32.928 --> 01:06:34.764
Hard to believe you
didn't catch on.

01:06:40.235 --> 01:06:41.137
You killed them.

01:06:44.474 --> 01:06:45.907
I did.

01:06:45.909 --> 01:06:47.510
They were your friends.

01:06:50.313 --> 01:06:52.079
Yes they were.

01:06:52.081 --> 01:06:52.915
Why?

01:06:53.983 --> 01:06:55.519
Because they were my friends.

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:01.321
You're insane.

01:07:01.323 --> 01:07:04.227
No, you have a
right to hate me.

01:07:05.361 --> 01:07:06.262
You have a right.

01:07:08.697 --> 01:07:11.801
You have a right
not to believe this.

01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:16.372
And you have a right
not to understand.

01:07:18.707 --> 01:07:19.974
You have a right to kill me,

01:07:19.976 --> 01:07:23.447
but you haven't earned
the right to judge me.

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.352
You shot Gail.

01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:30.586
You killed her.

01:07:32.856 --> 01:07:33.890
Yes, I did.

01:07:34.823 --> 01:07:36.827
How could you do that?

01:07:39.461 --> 01:07:40.831
I had to, Ryan.

01:07:43.198 --> 01:07:44.300
Now I can kill anyone.

01:07:54.477 --> 01:07:56.814
Then why am I still alive?

01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.083
Why didn't you kill me?

01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:03.419
Because I think
you understand.

01:08:04.521 --> 01:08:05.356
You left her.

01:08:06.588 --> 01:08:10.159
You didn't even stop
to see if she was okay.

01:08:13.229 --> 01:08:14.662
You had a chance to
save her but you chose

01:08:14.664 --> 01:08:17.901
to save yourself, to survive.

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:22.438
You're not Ryan the coward,

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.939
you're Ryan the living.

01:08:25.942 --> 01:08:27.344
Welcome to bein' alive.

01:08:28.243 --> 01:08:29.078
How's it feel?

01:08:30.379 --> 01:08:32.613
Are you proud of that instinct?

01:08:34.483 --> 01:08:35.318
No.

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:43.393
I didn't kill her.

01:08:45.728 --> 01:08:47.560
I didn't kill anyone.

01:08:47.563 --> 01:08:48.663
I would've left her.

01:08:51.567 --> 01:08:53.736
Why do we hunt a bear
instead of a rabbit?

01:08:56.839 --> 01:08:59.207
Why do we build skyscrapers
instead of huts?

01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:07.584
I'm capable of the great

01:09:09.219 --> 01:09:10.319
and terrible.

01:09:13.288 --> 01:09:15.921
I'm not burdened
with complacency

01:09:15.924 --> 01:09:19.429
and acceptance of satisfaction.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:25.131
You're just a
madman in the woods.

01:09:25.134 --> 01:09:26.636
Both of us are, Ryan.

01:09:27.536 --> 01:09:29.005
Both of us are alive.

01:09:31.139 --> 01:09:32.542
And you can still win.

01:09:34.978 --> 01:09:37.743
Leonard outweighed
me by 35 pounds.

01:09:37.746 --> 01:09:39.782
He was the best
tracker I'd ever seen.

01:09:42.352 --> 01:09:45.218
But animals don't set
traps and he hunted me

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.854
like I was an animal.

01:09:46.856 --> 01:09:47.890
You all did.

01:09:49.558 --> 01:09:50.760
That was your mistake.

01:09:54.496 --> 01:09:56.898
Well this is the last
conversation we'll ever have.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.865
Tomorrow there will
be no conversation.

01:09:58.867 --> 01:10:00.137
Tomorrow we will hunt

01:10:03.138 --> 01:10:06.541
and you will win
or you will die.

01:10:11.981 --> 01:10:15.786
And if you choose to
hunt me like an animal,

01:10:17.387 --> 01:10:18.222
you'll lose.

01:21:08.536 --> 01:21:09.505
No!

01:22:08.062 --> 01:22:09.029
You told
me it was a setup.

01:22:09.031 --> 01:22:12.565
Sit down.

01:23:04.687 --> 01:23:06.686
The wife is here.

01:23:06.688 --> 01:23:09.925
She wants to talk to you
if you feel up to it.

01:23:34.782 --> 01:23:36.852
Oh Ryan, oh Ryan.

01:23:38.353 --> 01:23:39.187
I'm sorry.

01:23:41.255 --> 01:23:42.325
I'm so sorry.

01:23:48.196 --> 01:23:50.132
Oh my God, look at you.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.969
Come here, sit down.

01:24:11.387 --> 01:24:14.456
This whole thing is so terrible.

01:24:17.326 --> 01:24:18.828
I can't believe...

01:24:28.536 --> 01:24:29.504
How are you doing?

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:36.045
I'm fine.

01:24:38.914 --> 01:24:39.749
I just,

01:24:41.349 --> 01:24:42.285
I need some time.

01:24:46.088 --> 01:24:48.187
To come back from
something like that

01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:51.160
must have been horrible.

01:24:55.897 --> 01:24:57.432
At least you're safe now.

01:25:05.706 --> 01:25:07.776
Shouldn't even be here.

01:25:11.813 --> 01:25:13.515
Should've been
Gail who came back.

01:25:21.857 --> 01:25:22.692
Did she,

01:25:24.358 --> 01:25:26.661
did she say anything before?

01:25:36.004 --> 01:25:36.839
No.

01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:41.811
It happened too fast.

01:25:44.012 --> 01:25:44.847
I couldn't...

01:25:49.785 --> 01:25:51.618
She didn't feel anything.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:52.822
It was painless.

01:25:58.026 --> 01:25:58.894
And Dylan?

01:26:00.696 --> 01:26:01.863
Did he say

01:26:03.197 --> 01:26:05.300
why he did this?

01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:09.069
I can't.

01:26:09.071 --> 01:26:10.803
Please.

01:26:10.805 --> 01:26:12.040
I need this.

01:26:18.446 --> 01:26:19.948
He just snapped.

01:26:21.383 --> 01:26:22.684
He was confused.

01:26:26.021 --> 01:26:27.956
I had to put him out of it.

01:26:29.124 --> 01:26:30.559
I had to make him stop.

01:26:45.307 --> 01:26:46.809
It's okay, Ryan.

01:26:49.044 --> 01:26:51.013
You didn't have
any other choice.

01:26:59.321 --> 01:27:01.023
I have
your suit ready, sir.

01:27:24.811 --> 01:27:29.811
