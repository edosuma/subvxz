to put down the deposit, so--

07:57.344 --> 07:58.779
- Did you guys come up
with a budget?

07:58.812 --> 08:01.014
- Not really.
- Do you have a budget?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.717
- Like, I think we could get by
with, like, maybe, like, 50?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.586
- We're not gonna spend
10 grand on flowers,

08:05.619 --> 08:06.587
sh-- like that.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.588
- How much are flowers?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.456
- Like, 15.
- Grand?

08:09.557 --> 08:10.558
- Yeah.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.959
- It's gonna be
very understated.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.393
We're not even
gonna have a cake.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.929
- Tom doesn't want a cake.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.565
- There are things that make
a wedding a wedding,

08:17.598 --> 08:19.667
like you wear a white dress.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.902
I don't know.
A father-daughter dance,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.871
and a f---ing wedding cake.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.372
- Are you sure you want
to do this?

08:25.405 --> 08:26.774
- Yeah.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.476
I mean, I'd be lying
if I said I haven't had doubts.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.244
- You guys maybe need to look
at some therapy

08:31.278 --> 08:32.279
or something, dude.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.985
- * But, baby, I'm bad news

08:38.018 --> 08:38.986
*

08:39.019 --> 08:40.688
* Baby, I'm bad news

08:40.721 --> 08:42.322
*

08:42.355 --> 08:44.592
* Oooh

08:44.592 --> 08:47.360
*

08:47.394 --> 08:48.929
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.764
- How are you?
- Good.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.033
- Hey, can I steal you
for, like, three minutes?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.602
- Three minutes.
- Three minutes.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.903
Thank you, Di.
I appreciate that.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.938
- I'll make it one.
- How are you?

08:57.971 --> 08:59.740
- Good.
My new nose is great too.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.810
- * Baby, I'm bad news

09:02.843 --> 09:03.911
- Lisa's right.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.178
I do need to apologize
to these girls.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.081
But do I think
that Scheana got a nose job?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.684
Yeah. Do I think
Katie's a bit overweight?

09:10.718 --> 09:11.919
Yeah.
But that's me.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.453
I've always been
a truth-teller.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.122
I just wanted to say--
I know you're busy--that,

09:15.155 --> 09:17.825
you know, obviously, the other
night didn't go over very well.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.660
- Clearly.
- I'm sorry for what I said.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.261
I just felt, like, on
the defensive side, Scheana,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.530
because the second you,
like, came at me, I--

09:23.631 --> 09:25.032
- When did I come at you?
- When you told me

09:25.065 --> 09:26.099
"You're not welcome."

09:26.133 --> 09:27.735
- You came up to us.
- And said hi at first.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.002
- Y'all had your own table
in the corner.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.003
- Didn't I?
Didn't I say hi at first?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.271
- No.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.873
It was a condescending,
like, "Hi.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.175
Oh, I see you're all working
on your summer bodies."

09:35.208 --> 09:37.010
Like, "F--- you.
F--- you. F--- you,"

09:37.044 --> 09:38.746
and then, I'm like,
"Are you kidding me?"

09:38.779 --> 09:40.080
- Yeah.
That's f---ed up.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.414
I guess, yeah. Yeah.
That was my bad. I'm sorry.

09:41.448 --> 09:44.151
- I guess the apology tour
is back at Sur this year.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.286
James Kennedy
is the opening act

09:46.319 --> 09:48.789
with the most disingenuine
apology I've ever heard.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.659
Blah, blah, blah.
I'm not buying it.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.193
Are you gonna apologize
to Katie as well...

09:53.226 --> 09:54.261
- Yes. Of course,
I will apologize to Katie.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.495
- Because what you said

09:55.528 --> 09:56.529
to her was far worse
than what you said to me.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.530
- Sorry that I can
insult you way

09:57.564 --> 09:58.832
better than you can insult me.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.500
You could say that
they should apologize to me

10:00.668 --> 10:01.935
for being assholes
to start with.

10:01.969 --> 10:06.974
- Thank you for apologizing,
and just talk to Katie.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.076
- All right. I will.
Thanks, Scheana.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.378
- Coming up...
- You are spreading rumors,

10:11.411 --> 10:12.512
and you cannot do that.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.714
- You're making it more
than it is.

10:13.747 --> 10:14.815
- Now, it's turned around
to where

10:14.848 --> 10:16.216
I'm the one making it
more than it is.

10:21.789 --> 10:22.255
- * What I want

10:23.290 --> 10:24.892
* Give it to me

10:24.925 --> 10:26.293
* What I want

10:26.326 --> 10:28.996
* I want it now

10:29.029 --> 10:30.998
* What I want

10:31.031 --> 10:31.999
* Give it to me

10:32.032 --> 10:33.200
- Here you go, Mama.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.668
- * What I want

10:34.702 --> 10:37.437
* Don't break it down

10:37.470 --> 10:39.472
* What I want

10:39.506 --> 10:41.074
* Give it to me

10:41.108 --> 10:44.211
- So how are you?
- I think I've been better.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.747
- I've been worried about you.
- Well, yeah.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.249
I wish that I didn't have
to lean on you so much,

10:49.282 --> 10:50.250
because, like,
it's hard on you.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.451
- Honey, you're my world.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.520
Oh, my gosh.
That's what moms do.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.856
They come and save
their babies.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.225
- I am in constant
communication with my mama.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.994
We talk on the phone
probably four times a day.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.097
It's 3:00. I'm sorry
that I'm waking you up.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.266
I just think, need my mom
to, like, please,

11:06.299 --> 11:07.835
just tell me that you love me.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.937
When I feel I've f---ed up,

11:09.970 --> 11:12.505
she always lets me know
that it's going to be okay.

11:12.539 --> 11:16.043
I feel like I'm turning into
a very, like, vicious person.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.577
- And that's not you at all.
- No.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.748
- I think we've come to the
realization you can't drink.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.950
- Like, I want to just, like,
be cool with everybody.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.184
- How are you ladies today?
- Hi.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.185
- Hi. Can I get you something
to drink?

11:25.218 --> 11:26.253
- Sure.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.089
- I would love a pinot grigio.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.190
- Definitely.
- And I'll have the same.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.391
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.860
- Of course.
- I know that I'm not innocent.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.162
I've said some
really f---ed up things

11:35.195 --> 11:37.564
to those people and about them.

11:37.597 --> 11:41.401
But I don't feel good
about it after I do it.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.104
- But I think it takes you back
to when you were bullied

11:44.137 --> 11:47.507
in, you know, elementary,
junior high, and high school.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.876
- That's why I had
acrylic nails

11:48.909 --> 11:50.010
and highlights
in the fourth grade.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.379
- I know. I know.
[laughs]

11:52.412 --> 11:54.848
- When I say,
"My mother knows everything,"

11:54.882 --> 11:58.151
she knows everything
down to the fact

11:58.185 --> 12:00.921
that I lost my virginity
with a red condom

12:00.954 --> 12:05.158
to the song "Lollipop"
by Lil Wayne.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.459
Very classy.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.528
I'm very emotional lately.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.131
- And with good reason.
- Ooh, yum. Thank you so much.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.966
- Thank you.
- I know that we have

12:13.000 --> 12:15.535
family history
of the drinking problems.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.171
It's a two-drink limit for me.
- Well, there has to be.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.840
- This can't be my life.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.810
[tense music]

12:22.810 --> 12:25.012
Those people are some
of the sh---iest human beings

12:25.045 --> 12:26.646
on the face of the planet.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.216
"I'm happy you don't like me,
because if you did like me,

12:29.249 --> 12:30.951
"it would mean
I'm like you guys,

12:30.984 --> 12:32.585
and I don't want to be anything
like you guys."

12:32.619 --> 12:34.922
- They don't know how tender-
hearted you are, sweetheart.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.456
You know, you come
with a tough exterior,

12:36.489 --> 12:37.557
but they don't understand.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.660
- I love you.
- I love you.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.663
I just want you happy.
I'm always here for you.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.998
- I know you are.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.834
You got Lala's back for life,
and I really--

12:46.834 --> 12:48.068
- Absolutely.
- Cheers.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.736
- Cheers. I love you.

12:49.837 --> 12:53.073
- You're never going home.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.076
[club music]

12:56.109 --> 12:59.579
*

12:59.612 --> 13:00.948
- All right.
It's Friday night.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.049
Let's get into it.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.084
- Let's do it.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.285
- Do you want me
to keep this open or close it?

13:05.318 --> 13:06.586
- You can keep it open.
- Sure.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.388
- I need you 1,000%

13:08.421 --> 13:10.858
to make that fantastic
out there on Sunday.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.526
- World Dog Day I'm making,
like, the biggest deal I can.

13:13.560 --> 13:20.868
*

13:20.868 --> 13:22.602
- Are we gonna eat like adults
at the table?

13:22.635 --> 13:23.670
- Yeah.
- What?

13:23.703 --> 13:24.671
- And there's real
cloth napkins.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.073
- Cloth napkins.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.740
- My relationship with Carter

13:27.774 --> 13:29.176
is the best I have ever had.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.678
We have this gorgeous
apartment together.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.713
Was it an easy shoot though?
- It was pretty easy.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.582
Yeah. It was pretty laid-back.
The talent was really nice.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.616
Sarah Jessica-Parker.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.885
- You have
the coolest job ever.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.053
- He's a photographer's
assistant.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.889
We have zero trust issues.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.456
He doesn't fight with me,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.058
and his name is not
James Kennedy.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.726
We have the puppy event
on Sunday,

13:46.759 --> 13:48.929
and then I was gonna
have people over.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.097
- On Sunday?
- Just for, like,

13:50.130 --> 13:51.364
a couple hours.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.034
- Oh, I'm exhausted.
- Busy day?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.468
- Yeah. What about you?
What are you doing?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.669
- The bussers were really busy,

13:56.703 --> 13:57.938
so I was grabbing the water
for my tables.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.172
- What about Brittany?

13:59.206 --> 14:02.375
I heard vaguely something
that went down.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.178
I heard exactly what went down.
It was Kristen.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.513
- All right. I'll have
your drinks right out,

14:06.546 --> 14:08.481
and I'll put your orders in.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.383
I have drama.

14:10.417 --> 14:14.554
Jax walked in on Kristen
going down on Brittany.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.056
- Are you serious?
- Apparently, there was, like,

14:16.089 --> 14:18.258
a lesbian, like, interaction--

14:18.291 --> 14:20.093
crazy hooking-up going on.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.728
- Jax was running his mouth.
- What'd he say this time?

14:21.761 --> 14:23.763
- Jax went up to Sandoval
at work and said

14:23.796 --> 14:26.433
that he walked in on
Brittany and I

14:26.466 --> 14:31.471
going down on each other
or one doing it to the other.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.240
- Did you guys decide
on anything?

14:33.273 --> 14:36.643
- Jax walked in on Brittany
going down on Kristen,

14:36.676 --> 14:39.179
and Carter was literally
just sitting on the couch.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.286
- It's like,
"Why talk about that at work?"

14:46.319 --> 14:47.554
Like, she's been here
for a week,

14:47.587 --> 14:49.022
and now all of her coworkers
are gonna be like,

14:49.056 --> 14:50.623
"Wow, that's how Brittany is?"
It's just not cool.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.192
- I know. It's not fair at all,
because you expect loyalty

14:52.225 --> 14:53.326
from your partner
if nothing else.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.662
- Yeah. Of course.
- Kristen does have

14:55.695 --> 14:57.097
a habit of getting
in the middle of things.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.866
I just never thought
it'd be Brittany's legs.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.969
- It's offensive to me for him

15:02.002 --> 15:04.671
to talk about me
and Brittany that way.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.507
- Mm-hmm.
- Brittany, Carter, and I--

15:07.540 --> 15:08.675
I'm trying
to remember where we were.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.178
It doesn't matter
where we were.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.414
We were in the bedroom,
but the door wasn't shut.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.449
Brittany and I were hammered
and, like,

15:16.483 --> 15:18.618
kissed a couple times,
and Jax came home,

15:18.651 --> 15:21.254
and then whatever.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.123
I don't know if Jax walked in
and saw us kiss.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.593
I feel like,
I mean, I don't know.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.161
I just don't really remember.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.030
- He embellishes the sh--
out of everything.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.598
I was there.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.001
- He's a--and then,
it's just, like, a big blur.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.337
I was super f---ed.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.905
I don't--I literally don't
remember anything.

15:39.006 --> 15:43.343
Like, I remember--
I know that he...

15:43.376 --> 15:44.444
I don't really know.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.016
*

15:49.049 --> 15:51.184
100%,

15:51.218 --> 15:52.785
I did not go down on Brittany.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.556
- Is this gonna be the topic of
conversation all summer long?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.058
- Yeah.
It is, actually. It is.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.294
- Oh, okay. Brittany's kiss,
2016, went down in history?

16:01.328 --> 16:03.330
- Speaking of going down--

16:03.363 --> 16:05.765
- I need to talk to you
for a second about everything

16:05.798 --> 16:07.034
that's going on lately.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.435
- God, I mean, for one stupid,
little thing,

16:08.468 --> 16:10.903
this is turning into be
a three-day conversation.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.339
- I'm upset with you, because--
- Don't be upset.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.041
If you show upset-ness,
then you're fueling the fire.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.042
You don't let anybody--

16:15.042 --> 16:16.409
- I'm not upset at anyone
but you,

16:16.443 --> 16:19.112
because you spread this,
and you did this to me.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.513
- You got to get over it,
though. This is Sur.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.515
This is L.A.
You got to get over it.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.850
There's nothing
I can do anymore.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.118
You can keep yelling at me,

16:25.152 --> 16:26.553
but you're still gonna
get the same outcome.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.721
- Because you need to
understand that it's upsetting

16:28.755 --> 16:31.191
and it hurts my feelings.
- It happened.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.360
You can't just deny that
I saw it with my own damn eyes.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.562
I am sorry.
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.663
- But you being like,
"I'm sorry.

16:36.696 --> 16:37.897
I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings,"

16:37.930 --> 16:39.932
does not make it seem
like you are actually sorry.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.071
I know that Jax is the type
of person

16:44.071 --> 16:46.773
that needs to stir up things.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.741
But the fact that
he's stirring up sh--

16:48.775 --> 16:50.077
about his own girlfriend,

16:50.077 --> 16:51.378
it's not okay.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.745
Seriously, stop.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.814
- Look, I'm sorry,
because when he first told me,

16:54.847 --> 16:57.084
I kind of, like, blurted it out
in front of Lisa.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.418
So I apologize.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.719
- Well, it's, like,
going around to everyone now.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.321
So that's why I've been crying
and everything,

17:01.354 --> 17:03.456
because it's like my boyfriend
is spreading sh--.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.824
- You're making it
more than it is.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.925
- Now, it's turned around
to where

17:05.958 --> 17:06.926
I'm the one making it
more than it is.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.361
I can't. I can't. I can't.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.464
- Then don't.
- All right. I'm done.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.832
- I'm going back to the spa.

17:15.568 --> 17:19.372
*

17:19.406 --> 17:20.873
- Hi, darling.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.409
Can you make sure
that this is watered?

17:22.442 --> 17:24.677
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.313
- Just finishing with
the silverware.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.915
- We're--yeah. We've got
a party of ten, I think.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.750
Are you okay?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.419
- Yeah.
- Sit down for a second,

17:32.452 --> 17:33.686
because one of the reasons

17:33.720 --> 17:37.124
that I was kind of wary
about you working with Jax--

17:37.124 --> 17:39.592
- I know.
- I hear every rumor.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.394
- I know.
- I hear every story.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.263
I understand what's happened.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.031
- I feel like he's, like,
tarnishing my name,

17:45.132 --> 17:46.966
and for someone
who I love to be the one

17:46.999 --> 17:48.335
who's putting it out
there like that--

17:48.368 --> 17:50.570
- And it--discretion isn't
his greatest quality.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.871
- Yeah.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.374
- Brittany is actually being
a very good waitress,

17:54.407 --> 17:56.143
and I'm pleased to employ her.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.345
But things have got
a little complicated

17:58.378 --> 17:59.946
with Brittany and Jax.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.482
I don't regret hiring Brittany,

18:02.515 --> 18:05.152
but sometimes,
I regret not firing Jax.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.487
- I just didn't think he would
do this to me.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.256
- I know.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.690
- I don't want to--I don't want
to look so stupid. You know?

18:10.723 --> 18:12.492
- Don't feel stupid.
You have feelings.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.960
You know what?
You're upset about it.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.496
- Yeah.
- You are. So stay strong.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.830
- Thank you.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.399
- Avoid him at the moment.
- Yeah.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.568
I'm trying to avoid him.
I said that--so I told Scheana

18:21.601 --> 18:23.470
that I was gonna stay
the night with her tonight.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.472
I have changed
my entire life for him,

18:25.505 --> 18:28.641
and he still will not admit
that he is wrong.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.243
I don't know
what to do at this point.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.912
He is the biggest piece
of sh--.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.849
- Hey, I have a question.
Why with Kristen?

18:36.883 --> 18:39.519
- I'm telling you, what he said
is not what happened.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.720
- Okay.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.189
That was my only concern.
- It--no, no, no.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.390
- Okay. Go on.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.391
Coming up...

18:44.424 --> 18:45.658
- Before we get married,

18:45.692 --> 18:47.760
I think we should
probably get a prenup.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.203
[pensive music]

18:58.805 --> 19:05.278
*

19:05.312 --> 19:08.047
- Scheana, are you awake?
- Yes.

19:08.080 --> 19:12.219
- Good morning, guys.
- Morning.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.355
- I guess I'm gonna try to head
home and see how this goes.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.689
- You need me to kick his ass?

19:16.723 --> 19:18.491
- I want him to be, like,
on his hands and knees,

19:18.525 --> 19:20.493
but I know that's
never gonna happen.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.295
- I'm sorry.
- I know, it sucks.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.863
- I love you.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.632
- I love you too.
- Thanks, guys.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.633
- For sure.
- Bye.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.667
- Bye.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.702
*

19:31.604 --> 19:38.611
*

19:47.086 --> 19:50.623
Did you miss me?
Oh, yeah.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.493
Hello?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.527
I'm here.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.265
Are you not gonna say anything?

20:00.767 --> 20:04.737
- Why won't you look at me?
- Because I'm sleeping.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.105
- Don't spread any more sh--
about me.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.374
- I have--you're the one
who keeps--there's no--

20:07.407 --> 20:08.708
I squashed a long time ago.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.610
- Yeah. But this is your fault
in the first place.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.780
My feelings
were just hurt, babe.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.848
- I mean, let's be very clear
what's going on here.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.450
I caught my girlfriend
messing around

20:17.484 --> 20:19.419
with another girl,
and somehow, I'm the asshole?

20:19.452 --> 20:20.787
- When you bring it in--
- Okay. So I'm a liar.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.121
I've been lying
for the last five years

20:22.154 --> 20:23.323
about everything.
I'm a liar.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.791
- You are.
You did exaggerate, bigtime.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.326
- Just me all of a sudden--
oh, my God.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.727
Go to bed.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.961
- You exaggerated hugely.
- Yeah. I exaggerated,

20:28.995 --> 20:30.797
because that--because I--
because I want that.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.131
Like, I want that.
I want to walk in and see that.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.300
- Well, I don't know why
in the world

20:33.333 --> 20:34.901
you would tell people that.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.603
- You--are you f---ing joking?

20:36.636 --> 20:37.970
- Like, why are you
such a asshole?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.506
- Well, yeah.
Because you're wrong.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.740
All of you are wrong!

20:40.773 --> 20:42.208
Kristen, Tom--all of--
you're all wrong.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.710
I'm the f---ing liar.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.012
[tense music]

20:46.045 --> 20:47.013
- I don't want--
I'm not doing this.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.515
- Yeah. Get out of here.

20:48.548 --> 20:49.782
- This isn't getting any better.
- You don't lie.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.083
So say, "Swear to God."

20:51.117 --> 20:52.985
- I swear to God that didn't
happen, dumbass.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.488
- You swear to God that--
- Jesus Christ.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.424
We talked about this
from the very get-go.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.658
- Stop talking about it.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.092
- You're exaggerating. I just--
- Oh, my God.

21:00.126 --> 21:03.463
So I'm gonna come in
and make that sh-- up.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.197
- I guess, because that's--
- "I guess"?

21:05.231 --> 21:06.499
- We're both sitting here,

21:06.533 --> 21:07.800
telling you that's not
what happened. You said it--

21:07.834 --> 21:08.835
- I'm the one
that looks stupid?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.102
- Why did you say it?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.671
- Because it happened.
- It didn't happen.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.672
You're just--
- Oh, okay.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.673
- You're just throwing sh--
around.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.674
Why would you
do that to me?

21:14.707 --> 21:16.142
- Oh, my God.
I'm crazy. I--

21:16.175 --> 21:17.710
- I just--I'm not doing
this anymore.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.212
If you're really sorry,
then you need to act like it.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.615
- Am I crazy?
I'm crazy.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.150
I must be crazy.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.752
I think I'm crazy.
I must be crazy.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.786
Nobody's hearing this.

21:28.855 --> 21:36.363
*

21:36.396 --> 21:37.730
- What is that?
- I'm gonna go to lunch with

21:37.764 --> 21:39.932
the girls that I'm asking
to be my bridesmaids.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.369
So I had an idea.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.871
It's, like, a little tin thing,
like this. So it opens up.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.606
I'm putting these, like,
little, like, burlap kind of,

21:46.639 --> 21:48.040
like, flowers on them
to make it look cute,

21:48.074 --> 21:49.476
and then,
I'm gonna put this little,

21:49.509 --> 21:50.810
like, chalkboard thing,

21:50.843 --> 21:54.113
and then, I'm gonna put this,
like, fine, like--

21:54.146 --> 21:55.415
I don't know what that is.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.650
And then, there's gonna be
a little balloon,

21:57.684 --> 21:59.652
and inside the balloon,
I'm gonna put the fabric

21:59.686 --> 22:01.854
that says,
"Will you be my bridesmaid?"

22:01.888 --> 22:04.891
- Holy sh--.
Lala, this is elaborate.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.226
- I have been talking
with this wedding photographer.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.462
- How much is a wedding
photographer, like, ballpark?

22:09.496 --> 22:10.463
- They can go up to 10,000,
but it's--

22:10.497 --> 22:11.798
- What?
- But--no. But it's--

22:11.831 --> 22:12.899
- Dude--
- But it's not that.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.867
I think they are between
like four and six.

22:14.901 --> 22:18.237
- Hundred. Not thousand.
- Hundred? Yeah.

22:18.270 --> 22:19.706
- Are you sh---ing me?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.508
Maybe you should just keep me
in the dark on a lot of stuff,

22:21.541 --> 22:22.809
and then, maybe towards
the end...

22:22.842 --> 22:24.176
- And then I'll...
- you can send me a bill.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.144
- Give you your bill?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.679
Tom definitely is frugal.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.114
Some, including himself,

22:28.147 --> 22:30.216
may say that he is
a bit of a cheapskate,

22:30.249 --> 22:31.918
and I do love
that quality about him,

22:31.951 --> 22:33.420
because he's smart
about his money.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.455
But when it comes down
to things like weddings,

22:35.488 --> 22:37.424
I don't want to cut
too many corners

22:37.457 --> 22:39.459
on this one special day.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.560
- What's up with the deposit?
Are you going--

22:40.593 --> 22:41.828
- Well, I have to call him.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.829
- I'm sure it's not
gonna be too bad.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.764
It's just the deposit, right?

22:44.797 --> 22:45.998
- Yeah.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.333
- That look
you just flashed me.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.335
I thought maybe we would spend,
like, 10 grand.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.737
That's, like, 5,000 each.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.104
Seems reasonable.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.440
- Hello. 20-Mile House.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.774
This is Kevin.
- Hi, Kevin.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.276
This is Katie Maloney calling.
- And Tom Schwartz.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.878
- Oh, and Tom, my fiancé,
is here too.

22:58.911 --> 22:59.912
I should mention.

22:59.946 --> 23:00.980
The venue Tom and I

23:01.013 --> 23:02.114
have decided on
for our wedding

23:02.148 --> 23:04.684
is called the 20-Mile House,

23:04.717 --> 23:06.453
and it's in
Northern California,

23:06.453 --> 23:08.154
in the middle of
the Sierra Nevadas,

23:08.187 --> 23:10.790
and one of my best friends
had been to a wedding there,

23:10.823 --> 23:13.826
and it is just magnanimous
and gorgeous.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.828
I don't even need to have
stepped foot there to know

23:15.862 --> 23:19.031
that it's gonna be everything
and more than what I expect.

23:19.065 --> 23:23.903
- As far as cost goes,
we have a base package price,

23:23.936 --> 23:25.838
and for Sunday
through Thursday,

23:25.872 --> 23:28.475
we discount that substantially,

23:28.508 --> 23:31.978
and so that's $5,495,

23:32.011 --> 23:33.345
and then, on top of that,

23:33.379 --> 23:38.017
it's a per-person charge
of $109.

23:38.050 --> 23:42.855
With the 10% gratuity,
it's $18,034.

23:42.889 --> 23:47.527
We require a $5,000
non-refundable deposit...

23:47.560 --> 23:48.761
- Okay.
- To hold the date.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.530
- Yeah. No, no, no.
We're going forward.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.831
- You're in?
- Yeah. We're in.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.533
- Well, great.
Congratulations.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.301
- Thank you.
- That's exciting.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.302
- Which one?
- All right.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.905
So we are gonna do August 17th,

23:58.938 --> 24:00.840
a Wednesday wedding,

24:00.873 --> 24:03.275
and there's
no turning back now.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.111
- Yay. Thank you, Kevin.
- Okay. Bye.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.312
- Bye.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.680
- I was doing my mantra
the whole time.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.248
I was like, "Don't complain,
and don't be cheap."

24:09.281 --> 24:10.983
That's my mantra,

24:11.017 --> 24:13.152
and that actually brings up
another subject

24:13.185 --> 24:14.420
I want to talk to you about,
which is, like,

24:14.521 --> 24:15.855
the least-romantic thing ever.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.125
Before we get married,

24:19.158 --> 24:21.293
I think we should
probably get a prenup,

24:21.327 --> 24:22.962
just as a precautionary
measure,

24:22.995 --> 24:24.531
just--no, no, listen.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.533
It's not an expression
of doubt at all,

24:26.533 --> 24:28.234
but this is just, like--
I think everybody should get--

24:28.267 --> 24:30.770
I don't know why everyone
doesn't have a prenup.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.971
It's just like
health insurance.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.540
Of course, I don't hope
I get cancer someday

24:33.573 --> 24:35.575
or some catastrophic accident.

24:35.608 --> 24:38.277
I just think--yeah.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.579
- I don't know what assets
he's trying

24:39.612 --> 24:41.047
to protect with this prenup.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.181
And I hadn't, like, thought
about it,

24:42.214 --> 24:45.051
but, like,
I'm not against prenups.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.987
Unless Tom is sitting on
some big trust fund

24:48.020 --> 24:50.389
that I am unaware of,
the only assets he has

24:50.422 --> 24:52.692
is thousands of dollars'
worth of sweatpants

24:52.725 --> 24:54.393
or some Ninja Turtle
action figures

24:54.426 --> 24:56.963
or a crushing amount
of student debt.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.866
If it's to understand that if,
God forbid, it were to happen,

24:59.899 --> 25:01.100
that there is sort of already

25:01.133 --> 25:03.135
something implemented
that would be--

25:03.169 --> 25:04.937
- Lala, oh, my God. I want to
come kiss you right now.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.272
- I mean, it's--I feel--
- Oh, my God.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.575
Sexy--I like when
you're reasonable.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.643
Logic wasn't always sexier
than tits and ass.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.311
You know?
I used to love that sh--.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.580
But when you've had a girl

25:13.613 --> 25:17.249
who's emotionally volatile,
we'll say--

25:17.283 --> 25:20.620
- I'm not out of line, I swear.
- I'm not defending Scheana--

25:20.653 --> 25:22.121
- She'll probably go
give you a lap dance.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.956
You could go in there and,
like, pull your pants down.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.024
She'll grind up
in front of you.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.425
- You're on the slippery slope.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.294
I'm, like, flush with love
right now and excitement.

25:28.327 --> 25:29.896
Oh, man. Yeah.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.798
You're so sensible.
Oh.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.634
- Okay.
Well, I have so much sh--

25:34.667 --> 25:37.804
I have to do before World
Dog Day is tomorrow.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.807
- I'm still in shock
with the photographer's rate.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.644
- * Shut your mouth,
I don't need your preaching *

25:44.677 --> 25:48.114
* On your knees,
I'm in charge on the street *

25:48.147 --> 25:50.817
- * Shut your mouth,
I know what I'm doing *

25:50.850 --> 25:52.318
[knock on door]

25:52.351 --> 25:55.622
* On your knees, I'm in charge
on the street *

25:55.655 --> 25:59.291
- * Shut your mouth,
I know what I'm doing *

25:59.325 --> 26:04.030
*

26:04.063 --> 26:05.632
- Hello. Come in.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.299
- You're such a weirdo.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.901
Show me your place, dude.
I haven't been here.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.203
- This is my Zen area.
I was just meditating.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.504
- Oh, look at that view.

26:12.538 --> 26:16.175
- This is my sleeping area,
my bed, my Union Jack.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.476
- Wait.
So you have a roommate, then?

26:17.509 --> 26:19.178
You--do you have a roommate?
- Yeah. Kind of.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.547
So my "roommate" right now,
his name's Paul.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.549
He's kind of, like, this,
like, stoner, old guy

26:23.650 --> 26:25.117
that plays pool with us.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.319
He's got this really dope
penthouse that I pay,

26:27.353 --> 26:28.821
like, very minimal rent at.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.658
Are you excited for the next--

26:31.691 --> 26:33.660
the next step
in our music career?

26:33.660 --> 26:36.295
Since last summer, not only did
I release Pump Sessions,

26:36.328 --> 26:39.031
but I also released Lala and I's
single, "Feeling You."

26:39.065 --> 26:42.769
- * Ain't nobody that I'm
feeling like I'm feeling you *

26:42.802 --> 26:44.270
* Like I'm feeling you

26:44.303 --> 26:45.271
* Like I'm feeling you

26:45.304 --> 26:47.139
- Yeah, yeah.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.775
- * Ain't nobody that I'm
feelin' like I'm feeling you *

26:48.808 --> 26:51.510
- Yeah. Yo, we just made
a f---ing smasher, dude.

26:51.543 --> 26:54.513
It's definitely inspired me
to make more music with Lala.

26:54.546 --> 26:58.851
- * Got you touching me,
I'm wanting you *

26:58.885 --> 27:02.421
* You're holding me,
but I'm needing you *

27:02.454 --> 27:03.923
- I don't mean to boast,
but come on.

27:03.956 --> 27:04.991
I'm winning over here.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.859
I had a video
that I released, but--

27:06.893 --> 27:08.560
- Wait. I heard something
about this video.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.496
Didn't you get paint thrown
on you or something?

27:10.529 --> 27:13.733
- So what I did was I mixed
blue glitter with blue paint,

27:13.766 --> 27:16.468
and I poured it on my face only
to reverse it in slow motion,

27:16.502 --> 27:19.438
so it kind of looks like skin
being peeled off my face.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.040
With everything that happened
with "Feeling You" doing

27:21.073 --> 27:23.075
so well on the album--
it's just, like, killing it.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.377
I feel like I could honestly
be playing, like, Coachella,

27:25.411 --> 27:27.546
Signs, like, playing
with all these big DJs, and...

27:27.579 --> 27:28.815
- Yeah.
- If I stay focused,

27:28.848 --> 27:29.882
there's no reason

27:29.916 --> 27:31.317
why I couldn't just run
with my dreams,

27:31.350 --> 27:32.719
and they could take off.

27:32.719 --> 27:35.021
- I don't want you
to let people f--- with you

27:35.054 --> 27:38.257
to the point
where you potentially ruin

27:38.290 --> 27:40.592
what you could be doing
at Coachella

27:40.626 --> 27:42.594
or, you know, wherever the f---
you want to perform.

27:42.628 --> 27:46.632
James can go and get drunk
and f--- up all he wants.

27:46.733 --> 27:49.335
The bottom line
is he's nice to me,

27:49.368 --> 27:50.770
and I will be his friend

27:50.803 --> 27:52.972
and have his back through
thick and thin.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.974
- Like, I haven't been
binge-drinking and stuff.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.909
That one night at the party
was, like, the first time

27:56.943 --> 27:58.310
that's happened since, like--

27:58.344 --> 27:59.746
- Yeah.
That was a sh---show,

27:59.746 --> 28:01.147
and Katie's like--
if we're trying to look like

28:01.180 --> 28:03.415
we haven't gained
5 million pounds,

28:03.449 --> 28:04.516
we shouldn't have been there.

28:04.550 --> 28:05.985
- Oh, God.
- I'm so rude.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.755
I just was at lunch
with my mom yesterday,

28:08.755 --> 28:10.857
saying I wasn't gonna be
a vicious bitch.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.491
- I didn't say
anything mean just then.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.861
- I'm a loose cannon, dude.
I got to stop that.

28:14.894 --> 28:15.928
Can we go eat something?

28:15.962 --> 28:17.396
- Yeah.
- I'm really hungry.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.131
I paid last time, so you're
paying for me today.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.933
- Technically, if the guy pays,
it's a date.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.468
- Oh, wait.
So if the girl pays,

28:22.501 --> 28:24.871
it's not a date?
It just means you're a scrub?

28:24.904 --> 28:26.305
- Coming up...
- I take it back.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.639
I apologize.
I mean that.

28:34.180 --> 28:34.981
- * You can't tell me
who to be *

28:35.948 --> 28:37.616
*

28:37.649 --> 28:40.619
* No you can't put this heart
on a leash *

28:40.652 --> 28:42.321
* Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

28:42.354 --> 28:46.025
* No you can't put this heart
on a leash *

28:46.058 --> 28:48.494
- Hi. This is Butter.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.797
- Oh, thank you
for helping me today.

28:50.797 --> 28:51.931
- Yeah.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.299
- Katie, there's loads
of things to do.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.700
Rally everybody together

28:54.801 --> 28:56.068
and make sure they're
selling raffle tickets.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.536
Make sure that they're
getting donations.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.670
- Okay.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.372
This day means
so much to Lisa,

29:00.406 --> 29:02.274
and she's worked
really, really hard

29:02.308 --> 29:03.843
to put this whole thing
together.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.145
Do you have any of the pink
donation buckets over here?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.347
Now, it's my first day
as her assistant on the job,

29:08.380 --> 29:09.481
representing her,

29:09.515 --> 29:11.483
and I want to do my best
to help her pull it off.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.085
Hi, guys.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.086
- Howdy, howdy hoe.
- Hi.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.955
Well, I have tasks
for everyone.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.423
- Tasks?
- Yeah.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.825
- I can't do anything
right now.

29:18.825 --> 29:19.992
I'm too hungover.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.894
- No excuses.
Take a bucket around.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.930
You ask for donations,
and you sell raffle tickets.

29:23.963 --> 29:24.997
- Puppy.
- Hi.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.333
- Hey, little pup.
Hi, guys.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.700
- What do I do when
I'm carrying around,

29:28.734 --> 29:31.470
like, $10,000 in cash?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.538
- You got a gun?

29:32.571 --> 29:37.243
*

29:37.276 --> 29:39.011
- We are ready to go.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.981
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.349
- I'm gonna go sell tickets now.
- Wait.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.683
I need--we need tickets.

29:44.716 --> 29:45.918
- You need to wear a shirt.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.053
- I don't want to wear
one of those shirts.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.454
This is fine.
- Quit being a little baby.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.922
Last night at Kristen's house,

29:49.956 --> 29:52.458
we just talked about, like,
how upset I was all night.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.725
We had a really bad morning,

29:53.759 --> 29:55.928
just screaming and fighting,
and I did go off on him,

29:55.962 --> 29:58.164
and I am still very upset,
and my feelings are hurt.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.266
- I can't allow Jax Taylor
to, like, f---

30:00.299 --> 30:02.835
my home up and my world
and my life.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.904
- It's gonna be really hard
to make it through this day

30:04.937 --> 30:06.305
without going off on Jax.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.941
I feel like every time I say
hello to a friend or something,

30:08.975 --> 30:10.509
they're thinking
about this rumor.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.111
- Let's go, sell some sh--.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.312
- All right. Let's do it.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.746
- Come with me,
because they're going together.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.048
I don't want to be by myself.
- I'm just gonna watch.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.349
- You guys want
to buy raffle tickets?

30:17.383 --> 30:19.051
They're $1 apiece.
- I'll take one.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.120
- It goes to the Vanderpump
Pet Foundation.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.721
- Do you guys want
a raffle ticket?

30:22.754 --> 30:24.690
They're $1 apiece.
- There's a lot of good stuff.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.058
- All right.
We're down for the cause.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.793
- Would anyone like to buy
some raffle tickets?

30:27.826 --> 30:29.195
*

30:29.228 --> 30:30.963
- Just buy ten.
- Ten?

30:30.997 --> 30:33.732
- It's for a good cause.
- Oh, two? Awesome.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.602
- Oh, wow.
Good, thank you.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.270
- We've got to make sure
we beat Tom. He's hustling.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.738
He's, like,
running around like--

30:39.771 --> 30:41.340
- Well, if you don't want
to stay in the shade all day,

30:41.373 --> 30:42.741
we would be selling a lot more.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.877
- Oh, wow. Look at them.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.114
- It's great, right?

30:48.147 --> 30:49.815
Some dogs don't get excited

30:49.848 --> 30:51.850
about World Dog Day.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.920
Right, Harrison?

30:53.953 --> 30:57.256
- * I keep holding on

30:57.289 --> 30:58.257
- Hello.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.360
*

31:01.393 --> 31:03.329
- Front row for DJ James.
- Huh?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.731
- Are we at a rave,
or is this a Sunday afternoon?

31:05.764 --> 31:09.501
- Chad, Chad, tell Lisa what
happened with James last night.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.004
- He was outside, smoking
a cigarette by the fire pit.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.072
- Outside where?
- By the fire pit.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.941
- Yeah.
- Where Patio Five is.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.142
- Right.
- So he's over there,

31:16.175 --> 31:17.476
having a cigarette,

31:17.509 --> 31:19.045
talking to a couple
of other people over there,

31:19.078 --> 31:21.813
and they, like, were yapping
back and forth at each other,

31:21.847 --> 31:23.549
and then, all of a sudden,
the guy, like,

31:23.582 --> 31:24.951
shoves him, swings at him,

31:24.951 --> 31:26.685
and then puts James
in a headlock.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.554
- The last thing I need
to deal with

31:28.587 --> 31:31.223
is a complication involving
James Kennedy

31:31.257 --> 31:34.526
when I've got 4,000 people
showing up at my charity event.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.861
- How are you doing, man?

31:35.962 --> 31:37.396
What happened last night?

31:37.429 --> 31:39.098
- You saw what happened
last night.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.432
It's ridiculous.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.134
You don't put your f---ing
hands on anybody.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.770
I don't care who you are.
I was on break outside of Pump,

31:44.803 --> 31:45.972
and my friends showed up.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.573
You know, everyone's drinking.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.275
I might have talked
over him or something.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.509
He thought that was super-rude

31:50.542 --> 31:51.610
and put me
in a f---ing headlock.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.145
It's jealousy.
I'm over it.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.680
- Jealousy?
- Well, yes.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.648
110%, okay?

31:56.682 --> 31:58.050
And if you don't want
to f---ing believe that,

31:58.084 --> 32:00.719
then don't--
I don't care if you do or not.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.722
- I don't know what James
thinks people are jealous of.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.492
He's a resident DJ
at a restaurant.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.995
He's no f---ing Calvin Harris
or Steve Aoki.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.796
He doesn't have
a residency in Vegas.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.698
- James is making it
increasingly difficult

32:12.731 --> 32:14.133
to actually keep him
in our employ.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.767
- He is making it very---
- That's a very good point.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.270
- He says provocative things.
You know what he's like.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.140
If James is at fault,
he will definitely be let go.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.608
I can't afford to have him.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.576
He's precarious, and I'm not
gonna put up with it.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.345
- It's f---ing jealousy.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.480
End of story.
I'm the one onstage.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.116
I don't care
if it's Dog Day or the club.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.218
I'm the one up, not them.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.553
I don't want to sound cocky,
but I'm young.

32:34.586 --> 32:35.754
I'm good-looking.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.323
I'm a f---ing DJ
in Los Angeles.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.291
I'm f---ing killing
the game over here.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.661
Will the owner of a Toyota
please head to the DJ booth?

32:42.694 --> 32:46.032
I found your keys. It's got
a Mickey Mouse key on it.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.634
A Toyota--owner of a Toyota,
I've got your keys.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.669
- Raffle tickets.
- Where is everybody?

32:50.702 --> 32:52.071
- I don't know. Raffle--

32:52.104 --> 32:53.205
- Let's go. Let's go.
- I don't know, honey.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.473
I'm trying
to sell raffle tickets.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.774
- I don't--oh.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.576
This is one of the things
I was most afraid of,

32:57.609 --> 32:58.777
working with your girlfriend.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.679
Say you have a fight at home,
which we did.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.148
My girlfriend hates me
right now,

33:02.181 --> 33:04.150
and she's standing
five feet away from me,

33:04.183 --> 33:06.052
and I'm stuck.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.619
Want to go, check in
with everybody? Huh?

33:07.653 --> 33:09.855
- No. We're doing our jobs.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.123
- Hi, ladies.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.392
How are you doing over here?
- Good.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.627
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.763
- I just wanted to take
a minute and say sorry.

33:17.796 --> 33:20.132
- For calling me fat and saying
that I'm pregnant and, like--

33:20.166 --> 33:21.833
- Yeah. It was really rude.
It was f---ed up.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.469
- No, but, James,
this is just what you do.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.803
You act like an asshole.

33:24.836 --> 33:25.871
- Right.
- Then, you come back,

33:25.904 --> 33:27.073
and you apologize,
and you walk away,

33:27.106 --> 33:28.640
and you're like,
"Ha-ha, idiot. Fell for it."

33:28.674 --> 33:31.243
So why even bother?

33:31.277 --> 33:32.744
- I mean...
- Me--I haven't done anything.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.080
- I know you haven't.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.514
I don't know.
I don't know, really, why.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.816
- I just think you're,
like, a horrible person.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.585
How am I supposed
to take this apology

33:39.618 --> 33:41.720
as genuine and heartfelt?

33:41.753 --> 33:42.988
It's--of course, it's not.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.423
I wasn't f---ing born
yesterday.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.292
- We have our differences,
but I just wanted to say sorry

33:46.325 --> 33:47.659
for what I said.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.128
- All right. Well--
- I take it back. I apologize.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.197
- Until the next time
when you f--- up. Thanks.

33:51.230 --> 33:54.133
- If I called you fat
and didn't really think it,

33:54.166 --> 33:55.401
then why would I call you fat?

33:55.434 --> 33:57.536
I probably won't say it again
to your face.

33:57.569 --> 33:58.537
But do I still think it?

33:58.570 --> 33:59.838
Obviously. I said it.
All right.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.107
- Whatever.
- I'm gonna be late to work.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.109
- Just mind your business.
I'll mind mine.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.111
- All right. It's okay.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.912
- Actually,
I'm taking donations.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.147
- We just did donate.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.348
- I think you've been giving
some people

34:09.381 --> 34:11.550
more than what they need,
from what I hear.

- Yeah.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.381

by this person.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.451
- You can do it.
Good girl. Good girl.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.553
- Kyle Richards--she's rich.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.720
She's loaded.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.556
Hi, oh, I need money
if you take a picture.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.158
- Okay. I'll give you
a damn dollar.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.059
- Oh, God. See?

34:54.160 --> 34:56.695

34:56.728 --> 34:58.330

She's done a song for me.
She's an amazing voice. Yeah.

and black and tits-out.

raffle tickets

I'm selling with these babies?

35:11.076 --> 35:12.378

section?

35:12.411 --> 35:14.346
- No.
There's no alcohol here. Zero.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.415
There's water.
There's lemonade.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.518

to get me, Lisa.

35:32.198 --> 35:33.665
- Who is it?
- Everyone.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.835
Everyone sees I'm doing well,

He's lucky if I don't
charge him assault.

He put me in a chokehold.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.639

- Nothing,

35:40.672 --> 35:41.740

- I have two,

35:53.585 --> 35:55.687
and I have now been
tempted so many times,

35:55.721 --> 35:57.223

- Oh, hello.

Under any other circumstance,
I'd be pissing myself

and talk to Lisa.

anyone's ever done.

good and positive?

- I'm so proud to know
you because of this.

- She's talking about Brittany?

37:24.643 --> 37:26.312
- Kristen is a squirmer,

37:26.312 --> 37:28.447
and I love to see her squirm,

37:28.480 --> 37:31.550
so I just cannot resist
a little dig in her direction.

You know, news travels quickly.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.422

right over my head.

- Bye.

- Bye.
- Bye.

of my history with those two.

- But they were so sweet now.
- They're here.

They're here,
and they're--they were sweet.

I'm excited.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.815
- Are you trying to, like,
force yourself to say that?

38:03.849 --> 38:05.551
- No, no. It's genuine.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.053
I feel good about her.
Don't give me a laugh.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.355
- I want to believe you, man.
I do.

38:09.388 --> 38:12.023
- Dude, it's true.
- Don't do it. Wait.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.425
Be in a relationship
as long as you can.

38:13.459 --> 38:14.760
Do not get married.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.595
There's no reason to do it.
It ruins everything.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.763
- So you guys are good?
- You know what?

38:17.796 --> 38:19.030
I would've never said anything

38:19.064 --> 38:20.165
if it was gonna turn into
a week-long argument.

38:20.198 --> 38:21.367
For God's sakes,
this is ridiculous.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.568
- The girl's just saying

38:22.601 --> 38:24.503
that you went crazy
on her again or something.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.937
- No.
- Why are you such a asshole?

38:25.971 --> 38:27.172
It's--
- Because you're wrong.

38:27.205 --> 38:28.674
All you are wrong--
Kristen, Tom,

38:28.707 --> 38:30.409
all of--
I'm the f---ing liar.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.677
Stop listening to them.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.711
- I--dude--
- They all need to mind

38:32.744 --> 38:33.879
their own damn business.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.280
Don't--
this is my relationship.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.915
Go, take care
of your own relationship.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.984
- To me, this is more
than just a silly rumor,

38:39.017 --> 38:42.454
because it's my boyfriend
who is spreading this rumor.

38:42.488 --> 38:45.491
The fact that he's betrayed
my trust so much--

38:45.524 --> 38:48.193
it's just--turns it into
a much bigger thing for me.

38:48.226 --> 38:50.295
- I would never want Scheana
and Shay's relationship.

38:50.396 --> 38:51.863
I would never want
your relationship.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.399
Everybody has their own way
of doing things.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.301
So until you're all perfect,
don't tell me what to do.

38:56.402 --> 38:59.771
- Thank you, everybody, really,
for coming here today.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.574
Last year, somebody sent me
a picture

39:02.608 --> 39:05.444
from the Yulan Dog Festival.

39:05.477 --> 39:08.414
When I looked
into this festival,

39:08.447 --> 39:13.184
I saw unbelievable atrocities

39:13.218 --> 39:15.220
against these poor creatures.

39:15.253 --> 39:17.689
We invited about 3,000
or 4,000 people,

39:17.723 --> 39:19.591
and about 3,000
or 4,000 people turned up,

39:19.625 --> 39:21.126
so it was really successful.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.629
The point of the day
was to garner attention.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.697
No to the dog meat trade,

39:25.731 --> 39:28.434
and celebrate our
furry little friends.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.437
I thank you all as a voice
for the voiceless,

39:31.437 --> 39:33.739
and you all will
make a difference.

39:33.772 --> 39:34.740
Thank you.

39:34.773 --> 39:38.444
[cheers and applause]

39:38.477 --> 39:39.811
- Ladies and gentlemen,

39:39.845 --> 39:43.148
just a reminder, make sure
you pick up your poop.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.850
Pick up your dog's poop.
Thank you.

39:47.352 --> 39:49.120
- She has literally had

39:49.154 --> 39:51.690
your back from day one,
and you embarrass her?

39:58.163 --> 39:58.630
[upbeat dance music]

40:01.132 --> 40:08.139
*

40:10.175 --> 40:12.644
- Hey.
- Open the f---ing door.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.279
- Rapunzel, Rapunzel--

40:14.312 --> 40:16.882
- What's up, dude?
- Hey. Hi, everyone.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.017
- Stassi just ordered, like,
a million pizzas.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.786
- She did?
- Oh, Brittany, shots?

40:20.819 --> 40:21.853
- Yeah.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.489
*

40:23.522 --> 40:24.623
- Hello?
- Hi.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.824
- Bubba--

40:25.857 --> 40:27.459
- How'd you like
your first day on the job?

40:27.493 --> 40:29.094
- She's the breadwinner now.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.328
Bubba's the breadwinner.

40:30.361 --> 40:32.464
- You are gonna eat sh--.
- Cheers.

40:32.498 --> 40:33.965
- I feel awful for Brittany.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.201
Brittany is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to him,

40:36.234 --> 40:37.636
and he's ruining it.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.304
Jason, outside.

40:39.337 --> 40:40.639
- For a lecture.
- Yes, it is.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.441
- You're busted.
- You're in time-out.

40:43.475 --> 40:48.046
- Time-out.
- You're about to get ripped.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.716
- You need to accept that your
life is actually, like, good,

40:50.749 --> 40:52.383
and having an awesome
girlfriend--

40:52.417 --> 40:54.385
that should be enough, and
I feel like you thrill-seek.

40:54.419 --> 40:55.687
More chaotic--
- I'm sorry.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.823
What is this concerning?
- You know exactly what it is.

40:57.856 --> 40:58.990
- No, I don't.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.025
- You're making up
f---ing rumors

41:00.058 --> 41:01.226
about me and Brittany.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.761
Brittany is, like,
the one person who has,

41:02.794 --> 41:05.363
like, never, ever
done you wrong.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.332
- I think I know
what they're talking about.

41:07.365 --> 41:09.768
Jax' big mouth.
- Oh.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.237
- She has literally had
your back from day one,

41:12.270 --> 41:14.372
and then, you embarrass her,
the person that--

41:14.405 --> 41:16.842
- I didn't make up any rumors.
- I was there.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.577
- You were sleeping on
the couch when I walked in.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.812
- We were--
- Jax, a drunk kiss isn't the--

41:20.846 --> 41:22.147
- Is it a little
bit embellished?

41:22.180 --> 41:23.549
- I'm not gonna go there,
because whatever I say

41:23.582 --> 41:25.216
is not gonna matter,
but it's not.

41:25.250 --> 41:26.652
Am I the "Twilight Zone"?

41:26.685 --> 41:28.587
Why the hell would I make
something like this up?

41:28.620 --> 41:29.688
It just doesn't make sense.

41:29.721 --> 41:30.989
This is between me
and Brittany.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.559
It's my relationship.
It's my problem.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.326
Mine, not yours.
It is my problem.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.427
- Don't yell at me.

41:36.461 --> 41:37.629
- I'm telling you it
is my problem.

41:37.663 --> 41:38.664
- Don't raise
your f---ing voice.

41:38.697 --> 41:39.731
- It is my problem.
- No.

41:39.765 --> 41:40.732
You're pulling a Jax right now.
Stop it.

41:40.766 --> 41:41.733
- No. I said it--
No. Stop.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.168
- Calm down. Wait.
- End of story.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.970
- No. You, stop for a minute,
because you f---ing lied.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.572
- Okay.
- So stop f---ing people

41:46.572 --> 41:47.973
over that care about you.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.675
- Thank you, Kristen!

41:49.708 --> 41:50.909
- Brittany's a f---ing angel.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.578
- I said, "Okay,"
but you keep going.

41:52.578 --> 41:54.012
Even though I said,
"Okay," you're still going.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.114
- Because I want you to get it.
- I get it.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.883
Okay.
Okay.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.417
You know what, Kristen?
You win.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.486
I'm gonna let the fact
that you went down

42:01.587 --> 42:03.655
on my girlfriend just go.

42:03.689 --> 42:04.923
You, me, and Brittany--

42:04.956 --> 42:07.125
we're always gonna know
that this went down.

42:07.158 --> 42:10.629
- Just don't f---ing hurt her.

42:10.662 --> 42:14.199
[dramatic music]

42:14.232 --> 42:16.067
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:16.101 --> 42:17.603
- Some of you have been bugging
the sh-- out of me about it.

42:17.603 --> 42:18.804
So officially,

42:18.837 --> 42:21.072
I am now asking if y'all
would be my bridesmaids.

42:21.106 --> 42:23.274
- Of course.
- Yay!

42:23.308 --> 42:24.610
- We're going by Schwartz's,
right?

42:24.643 --> 42:26.011
- Yes. He's cooking dinner.
- F---.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.278
There's no denying
you guys tortured me,

42:27.312 --> 42:29.748
and I feel like I never
really repaid you guys.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.149
- Uh-oh.
- This is special,

42:31.182 --> 42:33.518
and I want you guys
to remember this.

42:33.619 --> 42:34.753
- Dude, what the f---?

42:34.786 --> 42:37.623
- What the hell is that?
- Are you fired yet?

42:37.656 --> 42:39.124
- I'm not getting
fired over this.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.727
- I don't trust you, and it
makes it very difficult for me

42:41.760 --> 42:42.761
to keep you employed.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.229
- Oh, my God.

42:44.262 --> 42:45.897
- If you were to say to me
right now, Katie,

42:45.931 --> 42:47.699
"I apologize for calling you
a whore," I'd be like,

42:47.733 --> 42:50.101
"Girl, we're good."
- I call it as I see it.

42:50.135 --> 42:51.502
I'm also sitting here
with someone

42:51.536 --> 42:54.706
pretending that they haven't
had a married boyfriend.

42:54.740 --> 42:57.709
