00:10.010 --> 00:13.263
[Luke] Are you sure this
doesn't do anything for you?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.640
Oh, my God, I am so turned on.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.478
[sighs] I don't know.
There's got to be something in here.

00:21.688 --> 00:22.856
The human ear.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.065
This is stupid.

00:24.149 --> 00:27.235
This is necessary.
You said you were a lesbian.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.445
Shh!

00:28.528 --> 00:31.656
Jesus, keep it down.
What are you trying to do, ruin me?

00:31.740 --> 00:34.993
Of course I'm not.
There's nobody even here, by the way.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.705
Is-- no.
I'm trying to help you figure this out.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.000
When I said I was...

00:42.709 --> 00:44.502
I think I might be a...

00:45.128 --> 00:46.212
hmm-hmm-hmm.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.214
Okay.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.758
And why do think that?

00:50.675 --> 00:53.094
I don't know. It's complicated.

00:53.178 --> 00:57.932
And honestly, no offense, but I don't see
how you could possibly help me with this.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.476
Sure, I could.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.019
Do you date girls?

01:01.102 --> 01:02.771
No, I don't date anyone.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.939
You're the first person I've even kissed.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.275
Cool.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.029
-So, am I a girl?
-This is really stupid.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.155
No, it isn't.

01:12.238 --> 01:16.034
Mmms kiss other mmm-hmm-hmms.
And since I am not a mmm-hmm-hmm--

01:16.117 --> 01:17.285
What is your point?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.496
Did you hate it...

01:20.121 --> 01:21.581
when we kissed?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.876
No, I didn't hate it.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.961
It was nice.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.087
Mm.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.592
See? We're making progress already.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.512
Let's check out this one.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.057
Human sexuality, the answers.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.685
Oh, there's a test in here.

01:44.145 --> 01:48.316
All right, you have to promise
to be totally honest, or it won't work.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.110
Okay.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.154
"Question one:
Have you fantasized about sexual conduct

01:53.238 --> 01:54.781
with a member of the same sex?"

01:56.741 --> 01:57.784
Yes.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.331
"Question two:
Have you fantasized about sexual conduct

02:03.414 --> 02:05.333
with a member of the opposite sex?"

02:05.750 --> 02:08.253
Don't think, just answer.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.048
I mean, I guess so.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.467
Subject responds in the affirmative. Okay.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.721
"Question three: Would you be happy dying
without having experimented sexually

02:18.805 --> 02:21.683
-with both men"--
-Wait, dying? Of what?

02:23.893 --> 02:26.813
I don't know. Doesn't say.
We can skip that one.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.774
"Question four:
Are you aroused by pornography

02:29.858 --> 02:31.693
featuring members of the same sex?"

02:31.776 --> 02:33.945
How should I know?
I've never watched a porno.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.738
Really? Not even Cinemax?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.031
We don't have cable.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.033
Wow, that sucks.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.911
"Question five: True or false.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.872
The gender composition of any orgy

02:43.955 --> 02:47.500
is the most important factor
in my decision to participate."

02:49.502 --> 02:52.213
-I wouldn't participate.
-True or false.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.050
False?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.554
Scoring guide, let's see.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.805
What's it say?

03:00.889 --> 03:06.019
Well, you are "homosexual
with heterosexual tendencies."

03:06.603 --> 03:08.021
"Heterosexual tendencies."

03:08.980 --> 03:10.189
That's me.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.275
I'm your heterosexual tendency.

03:12.609 --> 03:16.404
No. That can't be right.
I didn't even answer two of the questions.

03:16.487 --> 03:17.655
See for yourself.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.618
Either way,
you're probably better off with me.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.660
What's that supposed to mean?

03:23.494 --> 03:26.456
Well, you don't want people
thinking you're a mmm-hmm-hmm..

03:26.539 --> 03:27.916
If you're with me, they won't.

03:28.499 --> 03:31.419
It's not like I'm gonna fall
in love with you or anything.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.463
Even if I did, I'd give you a signal.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.381
What, like a code word?

03:35.757 --> 03:38.009
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like, uh...

03:41.638 --> 03:42.889
...banana slug.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.558
Banana slug?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.769
If I find myself falling in love with you,

03:47.852 --> 03:51.898
I'll yell "banana slug,"
and you can head for the hills.

03:52.649 --> 03:56.653
But don't worry,
everything's gonna work out great.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.371

Luke, you don't have to do this, you know.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.510
No, but I want to.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.595
I-- Don't you?

05:05.722 --> 05:06.639
Hey, you two.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.018
-How's the cutest couple at Boring High?
-Dad.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.854
-Great, thanks for asking.
-Hey, I was just thinking--

05:12.937 --> 05:16.607
-We should probably get to class.
-Well, this is important, actually.

05:16.691 --> 05:22.155
I was thinking, I'd like to get to know
Kate's first boyfriend a little better.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.324
Luke, how about dinner Friday night?

05:24.407 --> 05:25.742
I'd love to.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.370
-That'd be great. My mom's out of town.
-I know.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.625
[laughs] I mean, I don't know.
How would I know that?

05:34.709 --> 05:38.129
So Friday it is. Shall we say seven?

05:38.212 --> 05:40.715

07:06.300 --> 07:07.510
One chance.

Goodbye, Grover's Corners

07:18.020 --> 07:19.939
You're goddamn right I did!

07:20.022 --> 07:22.984
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

07:23.067 --> 07:26.070
And you will know my name is the Lord!

07:46.257 --> 07:48.050
Um, but I memorized a commercial.

[stammers] I'm not the best reader,
as you know.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.475
Sorry, Tyler,
it's just we kinda need to see a scene.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.809
Says who?

07:57.310 --> 08:00.521
Go on, Ace, wow us.

08:05.401 --> 08:09.864
Do you suffer from eczema,
psoriasis or just itchy-flaky skin?

08:09.947 --> 08:13.659
Then stop what you're doing
and listen to this!

08:32.345 --> 08:33.804

Kate my girlfriend is actually in charge
of the costumes.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.195
Miss baggy jeans and T-shirt? [scoffs]

10:13.279 --> 10:15.239
No, no, I don't think so.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.998
Your boyfriend says you're doing costumes
for the movie,

10:24.081 --> 10:26.709

I don't know how I feel about that.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.710
I am?

I mean, yeah, I am.

Yep, um, we haven't really
discussed the details yet.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.137
I'm not letting you
dress me like a dork, okay?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.933
Um, yeah, o-okay. Got it.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.312
What are you doing right now?

10:50.691 --> 10:54.403
Maybe the aliens can go to a disco night,
and I wear this.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.991
We should probably wait
to see what the script says.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.786
I'm trying it on.

11:04.955 --> 11:08.292
So, now that you have a boyfriend,

11:08.376 --> 11:11.170
I'm assuming a new wardrobe is
on the agenda?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.005
Why?

11:14.382 --> 11:19.345
Think of it this way, last week
you were just Principal Messner's kid.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.638
Completely undateable.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.974
Now that you're with Luke,
I bet all the guys are like,

11:24.392 --> 11:26.060
"Maybe I could hit that.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.062
Maybe I should."

11:42.410 --> 11:43.869
Are you coming in?

11:50.668 --> 11:53.337
Um, so, how should I dress, then?

11:54.463 --> 11:58.509
Your appearance tells the world
who you are and what you want.

11:58.592 --> 12:01.846
Speaking for myself, the goal is boners.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.472
Gross.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.268
If I can make a guy hard just
by looking at me, I win.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.686
That's power.

12:10.604 --> 12:14.775
Well, maybe I don't need guys
getting boners about me just to be happy.

12:15.317 --> 12:19.613
Ugh, I hate having big boobs.
Everything just falls off of me.

12:20.739 --> 12:21.782

12:25.161 --> 12:29.540
Here, try it on.
You have no tits, it'll look great on you.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.333
Gee, thanks.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.544
No, I meant that as a compliment.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.380
You're so skinny and tall. I hate it.
[chuckles]

12:40.217 --> 12:41.343
Come on.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.428
[chuckles]

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
[Emaline giggles]

12:52.563 --> 12:53.564
Here.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.153
[Emaline] Hmm.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.197
[exhales]

13:02.823 --> 13:04.241
Something's missing.

13:05.993 --> 13:06.952
I got it.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.674
See? You look hot.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.385
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.970
I'd bone ya.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.848
[laughs]

13:38.359 --> 13:40.319
[Leroy]<i> Either way, people are weird.</i>

13:40.402 --> 13:44.865
<i>The key is finding the weird that goes</i>
<i>with your weird.</i>

13:44.949 --> 13:47.201
<i>The cheese for your cherry.</i>

13:47.618 --> 13:50.329
<i>Like when I took Sherry</i>
<i>to</i> Blazing Saddles.

13:50.412 --> 13:53.791
<i>Now that movie is not for everybody.</i>
<i>When Mongo punched the horse,</i>

13:53.874 --> 13:58.504
<i>Sherry baby laughed so hard,</i>
<i>soda came out of her nose onto the floor.</i>

13:58.587 --> 14:01.757
<i>-I lost four bucks worth of concessions.</i>
<i>-</i>[laughs]

14:01.840 --> 14:05.386
<i>Some people,</i>
<i>they might say that's a bad date,</i>

14:05.719 --> 14:06.804
<i>but for me...</i>

14:08.722 --> 14:10.099
<i>it doesn't get any better.</i>

14:12.643 --> 14:14.228
What do I call you, huh?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.064
Principal Messner.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.941
Mr. Messner.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.195
Ken Messner. Principal Messner.
Mr. Messner. Dad.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.449
-Hey, Mr. Messner.
-Luke. Come on in, pal.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.077
Thank you. I'm still trying to decide

14:30.160 --> 14:33.497
if I want to go to film school
in New York or Los Angeles.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.750
That might be dictated
by wherever Kate decides to go.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.169
It'd be nice if we were in the same area,

14:39.253 --> 14:42.882
but, hey, if anybody's gonna survive
a long distance relationship,

14:42.965 --> 14:47.970
I'd put my money on me and Kate,
'cause she's the cheese for my cherry.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.639
I'm sorry, the what?

14:50.723 --> 14:51.765
[door closes]

14:59.607 --> 15:00.858
Wow.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.450
-What?
-What a lovely dress.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.910
You look amazing.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.787
Okay, Dad, you can stop staring now.

15:13.871 --> 15:14.872
-Sorry.
-Uh, yeah.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.249
-All right. Thank you.
-[Luke] I don't know what I was doing.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.250
I wasn't staring.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.837
I hope you don't mind.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.089
I'm not much of a chef,
as Kate will tell you.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.009
No, it's no problem.
I love Chinese food.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.472
So, Luke.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.975
-How's your mom?
-Good.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.811
She's coming back from Frankfurt
or something like that tomorrow.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.022
-Frankfurt.
-Yeah.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.815
Good. <i>Gut. </i>[laughs]

15:42.483 --> 15:43.859
[Luke chuckles]

15:46.362 --> 15:49.073
You know, s-speaking of your mom,

15:49.156 --> 15:52.409
when I met her, I got the impression
you two were very close.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.204
Yeah. We kinda have to be.
It's like a team.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.665
Well, we understand that. Right, sweetie?

15:58.123 --> 15:59.833
Sorry. The dress, it's itchy.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.588
So, is there ever a third [clears throat]
member of this team?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.674
Someone, anyone? [chuckles]

16:07.174 --> 16:09.009
-Nah.
-Nah?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.010
[chuckles]

16:10.094 --> 16:12.429
What's "nah"? Naugahyde? [chuckles]

16:12.513 --> 16:13.514
I'm just joking.

16:13.597 --> 16:18.268
[clears throat]
So, no man in her life at all?

16:18.352 --> 16:20.270
Dad, you're being weird.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.897
-No, I'm not.
-[Luke] No, it's okay.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.524
Guys love my mom.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.359
-They do?
-Yeah.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.486
-What kind of guys?
-Dad.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.571
Pass the moo shu.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.617
[inhales, clears throat ] Okay.

16:34.868 --> 16:35.911
I'd like to make a toast.

16:35.995 --> 16:42.584
To my girlfriend Kate
and her generous father Mr. Messner.

16:42.668 --> 16:47.464
Here's to what I hope is many more
Chinese takeout dinners.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.716
Cheers.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.469
You know what, Kate?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.514
-I think your guy's pretty cool.
-[laughs]

16:55.597 --> 16:57.099
I'm about to embarrass you.

16:57.182 --> 17:02.062
After Kate quit band,
there was a dark period.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.899
You know, but I think
a little boy-girl compassion

17:05.983 --> 17:11.947
and companionship is a very good thing
for you at this stage of your lives.

17:12.239 --> 17:16.326
As human beings, we crave companionship,

17:16.410 --> 17:17.828
and uh...

17:21.957 --> 17:22.791
You were in band?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.586
-Briefly.
-She's being modest.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.504
-Can you play something?
-No.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.589
Please?

17:28.881 --> 17:32.259
-What don't you understand about no?
-Come on, pretty please.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.054
The piano's probably out of tune.
It won't sound good.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.847
-I don't mind.
-Why don't you?

17:36.930 --> 17:38.390
I mean, it's just us.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.558
Just us.

17:43.270 --> 17:49.818
[sighs] You guys are annoying,
but one song and then never again.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.570
Okay.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.991
You gonna play your mom's song?

17:59.036 --> 17:59.953
Is that okay?

18:08.378 --> 18:09.713
And no laughing.

Sorry, but, who is this?
