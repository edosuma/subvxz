00:02.001 --> 00:03.503
Previously on Lost:

00:07.383 --> 00:08.424
Sir?

00:09.968 --> 00:12.261
I'm gonna have to ask
that you open the door.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.271
How about we talk
about that other thing?

00:22.356 --> 00:25.108
The transmission
Abdul picked up on his little radio.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.027
The French chick that said,
"They're all dead."

00:28.112 --> 00:30.238
- We have to tell the others.
- What?

00:30.322 --> 00:31.698
No one tell them anything.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.908
If we tell them what we know...

00:33.992 --> 00:35.410
...we take away their hope.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.911
So we lie?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.427
Now, I found fresh water
up in the valley.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.303
I'll take a group in at first light.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.223
If you don't wanna go,
find another way to contribute

00:57.307 --> 01:00.226
because "Every man for himself"
is not gonna work.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.353
Uh, excuse me.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.772
Have you...
Have you seen my boy?

01:14.992 --> 01:17.952
I am going off...

01:18.036 --> 01:20.747
...away to hunt.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.124
And I was wondering if you...

01:23.208 --> 01:26.919
...could keep an eye on my boy

01:27.004 --> 01:29.839
until I come back?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.176
You're cool with this, right?

02:01.163 --> 02:03.790
- I just want to know.
- Well, you're not gonna know.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.626
- What's the big deal?
- It's not a big deal.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.252
I had my reasons.
I don't want to put it out there.

02:09.338 --> 02:13.966
It's just that you and your tattoos...

02:14.051 --> 02:15.676
...don't add up.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.225
You're one of those hardcore
spinal surgeons?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.560
That's me. Hardcore.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.647
If you're finished verbally copulating,
we should move.

02:27.731 --> 02:31.317
There's a beach of people waiting
for us to get drinking water for them.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.195
And the great white hunter's
getting restless.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.740
OK. Let's do this.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.953
Hey, Charlie,
ask Jack about his tattoos.

02:42.037 --> 02:45.248
You guys have an inside joke.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.416
How absolutely wonderful for you both.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.146
Stop! Hey! Stop!

05:20.612 --> 05:22.822
Get off of him! Please!

05:23.073 --> 05:24.407
Stop!

05:27.244 --> 05:29.120
Stop! Get off of him!

05:30.914 --> 05:33.124
Do something!
He's gonna kill him!

05:33.208 --> 05:35.418
Stop him, please!

05:54.396 --> 05:56.689
No! Stop!

05:57.441 --> 06:00.776
Stop him, please!
He's gonna kill him!

06:14.207 --> 06:16.751
The handcuffs!
From the Sky Marshal!

06:16.835 --> 06:17.960
Now!

06:36.063 --> 06:37.897
What happened?

06:49.159 --> 06:51.202
Water's this way.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.622
How'd you find this place?

06:55.582 --> 06:56.832
Luck.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.359
This is it.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.539
- It's amazing.
- Absolutely.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.082
It's totally you.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.840
Guys, shouldn't someone
look through this stuff?

07:45.924 --> 07:48.134
There could be
something useful in here.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.094
He's got a point.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.013
- I do?
- Yeah. Bring me your bottles.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.559
And keep an eye out for any
medical supplies, drugs in particular.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.186
Drugs. Right.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.509
Don't move.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.760
I was just gonna take...

08:32.846 --> 08:35.972
Do not move.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.893
What's going on?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.938
He's standing on a beehive.

08:44.316 --> 08:48.444
What's a beehive doing there?
Beehives are supposed to be in trees.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.156
- What now?
- If he moves, he'll split the hive.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.908
I don't like bees, OK?

08:53.992 --> 08:56.577
I have an irrational fear of bees.
I'm allergic...

08:56.661 --> 08:59.079
Please be quiet.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.457
We need to get something
to seal the hive.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.293
- To cover it?
- Yeah, hurry.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.464
I am getting tired of saying this.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.300
I was just walking the beach
with my son,

09:11.384 --> 09:14.261
and all of a sudden
this dude is all up on me.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.597
I didn't do anything.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.855
Surely there must be something
you're not telling us.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.482
Surely?

09:26.566 --> 09:27.816
Where are you from, man?

09:29.027 --> 09:30.986
Tikrit.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.449
- Iraq.
- OK, I don't know how it is in Iraq,

09:35.533 --> 09:38.202
but in the United States of America,
where I'm from,

09:38.286 --> 09:40.412
Korean people
don't like black people.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.373
Did you know that?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.168
So maybe you ought to talk to him!

09:47.879 --> 09:49.588
The cuffs stay on.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.633
- Louder, Omar, maybe she'll understand.
- Guys.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.594
That Chinese dude's gonna get
pretty crispy out here.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.764
- How long are you gonna keep him?
- He tried to kill Michael.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.935
We all saw it.
The cuffs stay on until we know why.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.359
Come on, man. Let's go.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.565
OK.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.234
Just keep still, man.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.069
I'm gonna try to cover the hive.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.905
This is the most crap idea ever.
It's never gonna work.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.367
- Pull yourself together, son.
- It wouldn't be an irrational fear

12:23.451 --> 12:25.285
if I could pull myself together.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.926
Who is he?
How did he get here?

13:23.011 --> 13:25.596
I can't exactly perform an autopsy,

13:25.680 --> 13:28.640
but there doesn't seem to be
any major trauma to the bones.

13:28.725 --> 13:32.728
We got another one over here.
Someone laid them to rest here.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.104
- Who?
- I don't know.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.981
Where did they come from?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.609
Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear
last week?

13:38.693 --> 13:41.236
- Yeah.
- Where'd that come from?

13:45.325 --> 13:49.036
- Any idea how long they've been here?
- Long. It takes 40 or 50 years

13:49.120 --> 13:51.580
for clothing to degrade like this.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.836
What is it?

14:03.510 --> 14:07.012
Hello! Anybody there?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.432
Everyone all right?

14:11.142 --> 14:14.019
- A few stings aside.
- You two run away fantastically.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.230
I'm glad my diversion spared you.

14:16.314 --> 14:19.274
I was only stung
several hundred times.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.694
Oh, and...

14:22.779 --> 14:24.530
...someone left this.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.369
It was... It was full of bees.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.746
I'd have thought "C's", actually.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.624
Sorry.

14:38.962 --> 14:39.962
Bloody hell.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.173
Are these the people
who were here before us?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.136
What are you talking about?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.683
Well, just...

14:52.767 --> 14:57.396
You know, there could have been
people here before us, right?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.855
Clearly.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.025
But who were these men?

15:02.110 --> 15:03.902
Actually, one of them is female.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.410
Our very own Adam and Eve.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.883
One of us should stay and help
Charlie salvage the wreckage.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.595
- You offering?
- Sure.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.640
Give me a chance to get to know him
a little better.

16:56.724 --> 17:01.103
We should move out.
People are probably getting thirsty.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.522
What?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.528
Forty-six people need to drink
a half gallon a day each.

17:09.612 --> 17:13.240
Carrying all this water back and forth
is gonna be a real pain in the ass.

17:13.324 --> 17:16.284
You're starting to make me
regret volunteering.

17:17.412 --> 17:21.289
These caves make too good a shelter
just to be used for burial.

17:21.958 --> 17:25.585
Adam and Eve,
they must have lived here.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.755
Their plane crashed,
or maybe they were shipwrecked.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.884
They probably found this place
and knew they could survive here.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.721
Unlimited supply of fresh water.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.265
The tree canopy keeps
the temperature down,

17:38.349 --> 17:39.474
shields out the sun.

17:40.643 --> 17:44.479
The openings are narrow, easier
for protection against predators.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.108
We don't need to bring
the water to the people.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.153
We need to bring the people
to the water.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.533
I think we can live here.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.514
Hey, what are you doing?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.351
Did you say something to my boy?

18:29.692 --> 18:31.610
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.030
Move it, Walt.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.411
- How come he doesn't like us?
- What?

18:41.496 --> 18:44.539
You said people like him
don't like people like us.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.627
Oh, man. No...

18:48.711 --> 18:51.171
Look, that's not true and...

18:51.255 --> 18:54.049
I don't think like that anyway.
I was...

18:54.884 --> 18:56.551
I was angry.

18:56.844 --> 19:00.138
- What did you do to him?
- What did I do to him?

19:00.223 --> 19:03.767
You tell me.
I've been with you since we crashed.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.354
Have you seen me do anything
to anyone?

19:07.438 --> 19:09.689
What kind of man
do you think I am, anyway?

19:11.692 --> 19:14.319
What did your mother say about me?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.948
She never talked about you.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.326
You don't know anything about me,
do you?

19:21.410 --> 19:23.870
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know a lot.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.956
Yeah? When's my birthday?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.333
August 24th.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.003
When's mine?

19:37.343 --> 19:38.760
Forget it. Come on, man.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.903
- Are you checking me out?
- What?

22:01.988 --> 22:05.281
- There's no harm in it, if you just...
- Trust me,

22:05.366 --> 22:07.492
if I was checking you out,
you'd know it.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.328
Yeah? So then what
were you thinking, right now?

22:10.413 --> 22:15.709
- I sure as hell wasn't thinking that.
- Don't stop to think, just tell me.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.339
I was thinking that if we were
living at the caves,

22:21.424 --> 22:23.383
we could build a dam
around that spring

22:23.467 --> 22:25.677
so that everybody
could have fresh water,

22:25.761 --> 22:28.388
and we could get the infirmary
off the beach.

22:29.140 --> 22:33.268
- You think it's a bad idea?
- No, no, it makes sense.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.894
But?

22:37.481 --> 22:40.191
- No "but."
- Good.

22:40.276 --> 22:43.403
A lot of people are still hoping
a rescue boat's gonna show up.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.864
They aren't thinking
about their own safety.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.366
We're gonna have
a lot of convincing to do.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.326
We?

22:50.411 --> 22:53.079
You still haven't convinced me yet.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.930
- Are you following me?
- Yes.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.349
There's no need.
I'm just going to the loo.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.144
Is there something
you want to tell me, Charlie?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.439
I'm going to the loo.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.524
It's dangerous out there.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.527
Until we get back, I'm not
breaking line of sight with you.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.154
Bugger off.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.575
I know who you are,
and I know what you're looking for.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.915
Drive Shaft.
You played bass.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.417
And guitar.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.086
On a couple of tracks.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.797
- You've really heard of us?
- Because I'm over 40

23:43.881 --> 23:46.966
doesn't mean I'm deaf.
I have both your albums.

23:47.051 --> 23:51.096
Although, I thought
that your self-titled debut

23:51.180 --> 23:53.681
was a much stronger effort
than Oil Change.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.352
It's a shame
what happened to the band.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.815
- How long since you played?
- My guitar?

24:01.899 --> 24:06.111
Eight days, eleven hours.
Give or take.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.362
You miss it.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.617
Well, a lot of wreckage.
It might still turn up.

24:12.701 --> 24:16.287
Undamaged? Still playable?
I don't think so.

24:16.372 --> 24:20.291
I wish, but there was this bloke
at the counter who made me check it in.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.376
- No.
- Yeah.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.671
There wasn't enough room in the cabin.
Fascist.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.715
You'll see it again.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.759
Oh, yeah?

24:29.844 --> 24:33.346
- What makes you say that?
- Because I have faith, Charlie.

24:46.861 --> 24:50.738
It's about time. I am dying of thirst.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.829
I think I'll let him sit in the sun
a while longer,

24:57.913 --> 25:02.834
then I'll take his wife aside,
find some way to communicate.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.629
- She knows why he attacked Michael.
- Sure you don't want me to talk to her?

25:08.549 --> 25:12.927
If you've got that under control, I'm
gonna talk to people about the caves.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.306
I might be able to get a few
to go with me before nightfall,

25:16.390 --> 25:18.099
start setting up camp.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.061
You're serious?

25:25.524 --> 25:27.525
Is there a reason you didn't consult us

25:27.610 --> 25:29.944
when you decided
to form your civilization?

25:31.322 --> 25:33.364
I'm talking about moving to the valley.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.742
What happened to
"live together, die alone"?

25:35.826 --> 25:38.286
Digging in is the only way
we'll survive.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.706
Our best hope is in being spotted
by a plane or a ship.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.210
For that, we need to organize
to keep that signal fire burning

25:45.294 --> 25:49.672
while others scout for supplies.
Digging in anywhere else is suicide.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.717
It is the only source of fresh water
we've found, Sayid.

25:52.801 --> 25:56.971
And staying on the beach in the sun,
without water, that's not suicide?

26:03.520 --> 26:05.813
I am not going to admit defeat.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.131
Now what?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.467
I already gave you
my statement, sheriff.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.512
I came to apologize.
I shouldn't have been suspicious.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.764
You were the victim in the attack.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.308
I appreciate that.

26:42.393 --> 26:46.396
But I can tell you didn't come all the
way over here just to say you're sorry.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.315
People are considering
following Jack to the caves.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.485
I'd like to know where you stand.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.112
Right here.

26:54.196 --> 26:57.699
I got one priority, and that's
getting my kid off this island.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.827
A boat passes, I'm not gonna be
on the hook for missing it.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.538
Good.

27:07.543 --> 27:10.545
Slowly. Just a little bit at a time.
A little bit.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.300
Glad you're coming.

27:15.384 --> 27:19.095
Hey, man,
I go where the boar's at.

27:19.430 --> 27:23.016
So, what up with you and Kate?

27:23.100 --> 27:25.476
You guys gonna move
into a cave together?

27:25.561 --> 27:28.479
- Am I in high school?
- Well, that wasn't a denial.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.899
Just get your stuff together.
We gotta get out of here soon.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.903
Well, well, well,
if it ain't the belle of the ball.

27:38.699 --> 27:42.577
What's it like having the doctor
and Captain Falafel fighting over you?

27:44.621 --> 27:47.498
Just call 'em how I see 'em, Freckles.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.753
Truth be told, I'm not the only one
wondering where you're gonna weigh in

27:51.837 --> 27:53.838
on this "moving off the beach" thing.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.718
Are you going with the pessimist,
or waiting for the rescue boats?

27:58.802 --> 28:01.888
- Are you going?
- Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

28:01.972 --> 28:06.934
We all pack up stakes for the caves,
the next day a plane passes by,

28:07.019 --> 28:09.437
they'll go on their way
and be none the wiser.

28:09.521 --> 28:15.401
On the other hand, stay here,
get eaten by boars, fall off a rock...

28:15.486 --> 28:18.446
...there's not gonna be anyone
to answer that 911 call.

28:19.573 --> 28:23.785
- You haven't answered my question.
- You didn't answer mine.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.953
And I asked first.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.631
Great, look who came to chat.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.845
I need to talk to you.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.983
You speak English?

31:42.067 --> 31:44.026
- Yes.
- Wait.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.821
You speak English?

31:48.615 --> 31:51.617
- Why didn't you say anything?
- My husband doesn't know.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.078
Why would you learn English
and not tell him?

31:54.162 --> 31:56.163
He has a bad temper.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.375
What my husband did to you today,

32:00.043 --> 32:02.837
- it was a misunderstanding.
- No, I got it.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.673
- Loud and clear.
- It was the watch.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.676
Your husband tried to murder me
for a watch?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.012
I found this watch two days ago.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.722
It belongs to my father.

32:12.806 --> 32:16.434
Protecting that watch
is a question of honor.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.728
Trying to kill me in front of my kid?

32:18.812 --> 32:20.521
You don't know my father.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.525
I need your help.

32:36.913 --> 32:40.708
Listen to me, you old git,
I'm going in the jungle.

32:41.126 --> 32:44.712
A man has...
a right to some privacy.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.922
Just hand it to me.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.968
You're gonna run out.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.137
My guess is sooner rather than later.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.015
Painful detox is inevitable.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.934
Give it up now,
at least it will be your choice.

33:01.063 --> 33:03.856
Don't talk to me like you
know something about me.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.275
I know a lot more about pain
than you think.

33:07.527 --> 33:11.530
I don't envy what you're facing,
but I want to help.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.578
Do you want your guitar?

33:29.257 --> 33:30.508
More than your drug?

33:30.592 --> 33:32.510
More than you know.

33:32.594 --> 33:36.555
What I know is that this island just
might give you what you're looking for

33:36.640 --> 33:39.100
but you have to
give the island something.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.705
You really think you can find my guitar?

34:03.792 --> 34:05.251
Look up, Charlie.

34:05.335 --> 34:08.462
You're not gonna ask me
to pray or something?

34:08.547 --> 34:10.172
I want you to look up.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.610
It's almost time to go.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.491
I don't want to be Eve.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.455
No one's asking you to.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.791
I just can't...

34:45.876 --> 34:48.210
- ...dig in.
- Why not?

34:48.295 --> 34:51.964
Someone else can stay here.
Keep a lookout. Wait for rescue.

34:52.047 --> 34:53.757
Why does it have to be you?

34:53.842 --> 34:56.385
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

35:04.019 --> 35:06.729
Kate, how did you get to be this way?

35:08.023 --> 35:09.940
Just what is it that you did?

35:10.025 --> 35:12.401
You had your chance to know.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.414
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.673
You know where to find me too.

35:41.348 --> 35:45.518
I know you can't understand a word,
and I'm not the talking-out-loud type,

35:45.602 --> 35:49.980
but since I have a captive audience,
I hope for your sake you pay attention.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.942
I'm not exactly having
the best month of my life.

35:53.026 --> 35:56.028
I barely knew my son,
and now I gotta be his daddy.

35:56.112 --> 35:59.865
And then to top it off, I have a
deranged Korean guy trying to kill me,

35:59.950 --> 36:01.075
and for what?

36:02.410 --> 36:04.954
Look, I get it, all right.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.414
It's the watch. Mine broke.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.166
I found this in the wreckage

36:09.251 --> 36:13.504
and I figured, hey, why let
a $20,000 watch go to waste?

36:13.588 --> 36:17.299
Which is ridiculous since time
doesn't matter on a damn island!

36:19.636 --> 36:21.262
Son of a...

36:27.352 --> 36:29.854
Stay away from me.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.106
And my kid.

36:45.787 --> 36:50.332
In 16 hours, I need to land in LAX,
and I need that coffin to clear customs

36:50.417 --> 36:53.294
because there is going to be
a hearse waiting there...

38:59.879 --> 39:04.633
Final boarding call for Oceanic Flight
125 non-stop to Singapore,

39:04.718 --> 39:06.593
leaving from gate 40.

39:06.678 --> 39:10.264
All ticketed passengers should be
aboard for imminent departure.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.515
Thank you.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.617
Hello!

39:36.583 --> 39:38.375
What's this?

39:39.669 --> 39:41.587
New tenants.

39:45.967 --> 39:49.136
A short walk. They lied.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.398
Can I ask you something?

40:43.483 --> 40:45.567
Anything you want, man.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.946
When's your birthday?
