WEBVTT

00:00.025 --> 00:02.750
- What is it you're looking for?
- The Nootka Sound treaty.

00:02.800 --> 00:06.425
I may need to prove to a tribunal
that the land was acquired by treaty

00:06.475 --> 00:07.850
and not by conquest.

00:07.900 --> 00:10.975
Pettifer said if Delaney wanted to
trade with the Indians at Nootka,

00:11.025 --> 00:13.975
the only merchandise you could
possibly use would be gunpowder.

00:14.025 --> 00:16.775
- Where the fuck are we?
- My new factory.

00:16.825 --> 00:18.825
I have a theory that
the introduction of several

00:18.875 --> 00:22.175
barrels of saltpetre can cut the
leaching stage down to four weeks.

00:22.225 --> 00:25.700
There is only one place where
one can find refined saltpetre.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.375
The warehouse of the
East India Company at Wapping Wall.

00:28.425 --> 00:30.025
And I'm planning a robbery.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.450
- You tell Carlsbad my name.
- And who's Carlsbad?

00:34.500 --> 00:35.825
Carlsbad is the head of

00:35.875 --> 00:39.350
the American Society of
Secret Correspondence in London.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.775
At all times your life is
in our hands.

00:41.825 --> 00:44.375
As is your name in mine. Carlsbad.

00:44.425 --> 00:47.025
If they invited us both,
then they probably know.

00:47.075 --> 00:48.050
Who knows?

00:48.100 --> 00:51.550
I challenge James Delaney
to a duel, to the death.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.025
Do you accept?!

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:36.825 --> 03:37.875
Good morning.

03:41.475 --> 03:45.700
The Gypsy woman owns this island
between two parishes.

03:45.750 --> 03:50.025
It is tradition she offers duellists
a little token of good luck.

03:50.075 --> 03:52.975
Three shillings each for heather
and goose feathers.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.475
This is not a fairground.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.900
Gentlemen,

03:57.950 --> 04:00.775
a slight has been perceived

04:00.825 --> 04:03.175
and one of you seeks satisfaction.

04:03.225 --> 04:04.275
Which?

04:05.550 --> 04:07.475
Here is my pistol for inspection.

04:09.300 --> 04:12.225
This is my second,
Mr. Hope of Trinity Lane.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.000
May I see your pistol?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.100
Can we please get on with it?
This fog is pestilential.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.575
Where is your second?

04:29.625 --> 04:31.050
I don't have one.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.500
The code requires you have a second.

04:32.550 --> 04:33.600
I don't have one.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.500
Let's just say this woman
is yours and she is late.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.825
Could you not find a boat
like a normal person?

04:44.875 --> 04:48.150
I was bored and I've never seen
a man shot before.

04:50.950 --> 04:54.425
Why don't you go and stand over
there by the fire and keep warm?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.225
Duellists, stand apart
with the attorney between you.

05:05.800 --> 05:10.875
No lack of faith in either party,
but I need payment in advance.

05:12.500 --> 05:18.425
On my instruction, the duellists
will take up position at the points.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.625
Anyone firing <i>à l'outrance</i>
will be fair game to be shot.

05:25.775 --> 05:27.625
You will duel to first blood...

05:27.675 --> 05:28.700
To the death!

05:30.200 --> 05:31.900
To first blood.

05:33.125 --> 05:37.650
According to the Irish code of 1777,

05:37.700 --> 05:41.550
any man wounded will be tended
by the doctor.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.950
And no second shot will be
fired by either gun.

05:53.350 --> 05:56.500
Gentlemen, take up your positions.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.475
The aggrieved party,
at the nearest point.

06:14.900 --> 06:20.825
When I drop this handkerchief,
you will walk towards each other.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.025
And, at a time of your choosing,

06:23.075 --> 06:26.700
there will be
a polite exchange of bullets.

06:52.275 --> 06:55.000
Dear God, have mercy on my soul.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.625
Satisfied?

07:18.625 --> 07:19.875
My apologies.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.675
That was an excellent shot.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.950
I can only assume that your second
is a Company man.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.550
Since he failed to load
a ball in your pistol.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.200
Dear God!

07:50.275 --> 07:53.500
It would appear that my life
is more precious than yours.

07:56.875 --> 07:57.900
Good day.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.900
You have ash on your hands.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.425
Where is the maid?

09:09.300 --> 09:10.350
I sent her out.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.100
For champagne?

09:24.150 --> 09:26.425
Or potatoes?

09:26.475 --> 09:27.800
Or both?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.350
So, how did it resolve itself?
Did you both see sense?

09:38.400 --> 09:40.650
No.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.825
I shot him.

09:42.875 --> 09:43.900
Between the eyes.

09:45.075 --> 09:49.000
And a host of devils flew out of the
hole in his head and down the river.

09:51.225 --> 09:55.050
In that event, it would be potatoes,
wouldn't it?

09:55.100 --> 09:56.475
Simple sustenance.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.100
Life goes on.

10:05.075 --> 10:07.575
Before you drink any more,
could you tell me what happened?

10:07.625 --> 10:08.800
But in the event...

10:10.400 --> 10:13.625
of a messenger coming to tell you

10:13.675 --> 10:16.450
that he had killed me,

10:16.500 --> 10:18.850
well,

10:18.900 --> 10:20.100
champagne!

10:21.200 --> 10:22.825
All the wild possibilities.

10:29.950 --> 10:32.225
In truth, neither is the case.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.225
It was void.

10:38.225 --> 10:39.275
How?

10:43.100 --> 10:44.425
Go and wash your hands.

10:45.675 --> 10:47.550
No need for any more questions.

10:49.025 --> 10:53.150
Not when half of London will be
retelling the story anyway.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.000
So I shall hear through gossip?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.675
As I hear about you.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.425
So, how was the party?

11:10.475 --> 11:13.300
Well, it was entertaining.

11:13.350 --> 11:15.425
And how did you end up
in the duck pond?

11:15.475 --> 11:18.600
She was legless. She tried to catch
a salmon with her feet.

11:20.350 --> 11:23.275
If he stayed to eat the eggs
I boiled for him...

11:25.275 --> 11:28.650
he would hear <i>my</i> story of last night.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.250
Soldiers in red. Soldiers in blue.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.575
Running by the window.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.850
Out there on the foreshore.

11:36.900 --> 11:41.550
Stopping the river traffic and
searching every barge going east.

11:42.550 --> 11:46.650
You see, Miss Bow,
last night there was a robbery.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.350
From the East India Arsenal.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.375
Ingredients for making gunpowder,

11:54.425 --> 11:56.700
stolen from under the Company's noses.

12:01.425 --> 12:03.975
Insurrectionists, they say.

12:04.025 --> 12:05.200
Frenchmen.

12:09.475 --> 12:11.550
Though not one of them spoke French.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.550
The Company have already stated
those involved will hang.

12:21.225 --> 12:24.250
The lady and I will take
our breakfast on the foreshore

12:24.300 --> 12:26.100
this morning, thank you.

12:26.150 --> 12:31.550
And, when they come, let them in.
You can open every door.

12:33.275 --> 12:35.100
We have nothing here to hide.

12:43.700 --> 12:44.900
You will hang.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.600
They will catch you and hang you.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.575
I need you to bring me the trunk
with my father's belongings today.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.350
Explain how you will not hang.

12:58.475 --> 13:01.750
Explain to me why you crossed
a river to watch me get shot.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.600
It was shallow and I needed
a better view. Your turn.

13:10.675 --> 13:14.500
The saltpetre we stole had already
been sold to the Royal Navy.

13:18.425 --> 13:20.425
So it belonged to the Crown.

13:20.475 --> 13:23.700
So therefore, the Prince Regent has
an excuse to prosecute the Company

13:23.750 --> 13:27.400
for negligence, as the powder
was in their charge at the time.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.975
The Company can cause me
a lot of difficulties,

13:31.025 --> 13:33.850
but only the King can have me hanged.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.000
The Crown will choose to make a deal.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.500
So I will not hang.

13:43.425 --> 13:47.750
Look, I'm very happy to admit that
I don't want James Delaney to die.

13:48.950 --> 13:52.375
But can you also admit that you
don't want James Delaney to die?

13:52.425 --> 13:55.425
You'll get me my trunk today.
That's your business.

13:55.475 --> 13:56.700
All right?

14:09.550 --> 14:11.900
I don't want James Delaney
to die either.

14:13.225 --> 14:14.550
Who are you?

14:14.600 --> 14:16.150
I'm Winter.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.900
They say he's the devil,

14:18.950 --> 14:20.000
but not to me.

14:21.950 --> 14:23.875
He promised to take me to America.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.225
Yeah, if he lives beyond sunset.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.225
Check the barrels!
All of them!

14:32.275 --> 14:35.425
There's got to be something here.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.950
Search everywhere!

14:37.000 --> 14:40.425
Move! Come on!
Search the boat. Come on!

14:40.475 --> 14:43.375
Get them off! Come on!

14:43.425 --> 14:46.675
Check below. You, check the bilges.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.650
There's nothing.
Well, it can't have just vanished.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.400
What's this?

14:55.425 --> 14:58.300
Cellar empty. Apart from rats
and river water, sir.

14:58.350 --> 14:59.900
Keep looking!

14:59.950 --> 15:01.000
Carry on.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.550
You've had a fall.

16:33.825 --> 16:37.225
You probably don't remember
who you are, so let me remind you.

16:37.275 --> 16:41.150
You've been following me, haven't you?

16:41.200 --> 16:46.300
Now. Are you King
or are you Company? Hm?

16:48.675 --> 16:49.800
It doesn't matter.

16:53.225 --> 16:56.975
Now there is nothing up that road
for you apart from death

16:57.025 --> 16:58.500
and anybody like you.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.550
So you run along and tell your friends

17:00.600 --> 17:02.400
how you almost lost your heart.

17:41.025 --> 17:42.425
Love thy husband,

17:42.475 --> 17:45.100
look to thy servants,
cherish thy guests.

17:46.675 --> 17:51.225
Now, Hal, to the news at court,
for the robbery lad.

17:51.275 --> 17:53.100
How is that answered?

17:56.600 --> 17:59.900
How is it answered, Mr. Delaney?

18:02.675 --> 18:04.075
The Company is looking.

18:05.675 --> 18:07.625
I think the Prince may be amused.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.750
Hm.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.425
All these chemicals I ingest...

18:13.825 --> 18:17.100
chase lines of Shakespeare
out of me sometimes unbidden.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.950
Which brings me to that rather
delightful woman

18:24.000 --> 18:26.225
you were at the party with.

18:26.275 --> 18:27.900
An actress, she told me.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.075
Is she yours or...

18:34.700 --> 18:36.550
could a chemist call upon her?

18:38.475 --> 18:39.700
For tea or something?

18:45.075 --> 18:46.275
Show me the cargo.

19:04.675 --> 19:06.075
Brace!

19:08.400 --> 19:10.500
Brace, can you come and help me?

19:13.625 --> 19:15.225
What the hell happened here?

19:15.275 --> 19:17.275
Bloody soldiers raided the house.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.950
Did you hear me shouting?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.300
Can't you see I'm busy?

19:28.875 --> 19:30.775
Where's James?

19:30.825 --> 19:32.350
How the hell should I know?

19:42.300 --> 19:43.425
Brace...

19:45.700 --> 19:47.150
what's the matter?

19:51.625 --> 19:54.500
I thought he'd burned that damned
trunk on the foreshore along

19:54.550 --> 19:55.875
with everything else.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.650
It would float.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.625
Slip it into the ebb tide
and let the river take it.

20:06.075 --> 20:07.350
Or it could burn.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.225
- Do you know what's inside it?
- Aye.

20:11.275 --> 20:12.300
The truth.

20:15.225 --> 20:16.825
If it was up to me, I'd burn it.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.900
Less chance the river
might bring it back.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.825
I've asked the Weasel
for some sailcloth

20:29.875 --> 20:31.550
to cover it against the rain.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.550
I've already breakfasted
on a little of it.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.825
The quality's exceptional.

20:38.875 --> 20:42.425
Almost as good as the bat shit
distillations of Burma.

20:45.075 --> 20:46.875
Why don't you just fix the roof?

20:49.475 --> 20:52.550
Because a canvas sheet would protect
the powder perfectly well

20:52.600 --> 20:53.625
and be much cheaper.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.150
And you think she's beautiful?

20:58.200 --> 20:59.225
Who?

21:00.800 --> 21:01.775
The actress.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.375
Hm!

21:04.425 --> 21:07.425
Not only is she among the large
number of women I would sleep with,

21:07.475 --> 21:09.500
she's also among
the much smaller group of women

21:09.550 --> 21:11.500
I would masturbate over.

21:15.425 --> 21:16.875
Well, this is fun, isn't it?

21:23.675 --> 21:26.025
So, can I call on her or not?

21:26.075 --> 21:27.775
No.

21:27.825 --> 21:29.075
So she is yours?

21:34.550 --> 21:36.100
Given the quality of the saltpetre,

21:36.150 --> 21:38.225
how long will it take
to make gunpowder?

21:38.275 --> 21:41.500
Four weeks,
and I'll need an assistant.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.600
Hm.

22:16.825 --> 22:18.150
I need you...

22:19.700 --> 22:22.475
to fetch me a ship's sail
to cover my delivery.

22:32.150 --> 22:33.425
Go.

22:33.475 --> 22:34.500
Stay.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.800
Sit. Sit there.

22:50.675 --> 22:55.025
I haven't told that boy anything.
I didn't think it safe.

23:01.100 --> 23:04.625
The sacks of saltpetre
in the barn were stolen.

23:04.675 --> 23:05.850
Why burden him?

23:05.900 --> 23:09.975
They were stolen from
the Honourable East India Company.

23:10.025 --> 23:11.100
All right?

23:11.150 --> 23:16.650
Now anybody who knows of its
whereabouts but does not report it

23:16.700 --> 23:18.350
is liable to hang.

23:24.150 --> 23:26.300
So, you are now one of us.

23:44.225 --> 23:45.675
Your apprentice.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.700
Lick.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.025
Lick your finger.

24:31.950 --> 24:36.375
Now, gentlemen, before I go
on the subject of confidence...

24:36.425 --> 24:38.175
and betrayal,

24:38.225 --> 24:43.575
I hear that the Company are offering
ã10 for any information.

24:43.625 --> 24:44.975
Hm?

24:45.025 --> 24:52.000
I also know that one of you
has already considered collecting.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.025
Let me be very clear.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.650
I know which one of you it is.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.550
And I want you to know
that there will be

25:03.600 --> 25:07.875
no place for that man on my ship
when we sail to the New World.

25:10.150 --> 25:12.750
Because he will be of no use to me.

25:14.075 --> 25:17.225
He will be of no use.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.425
For he will have no thumb.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.250
Hm?

25:36.300 --> 25:38.675
I am inside your heads, gentlemen.

25:41.625 --> 25:43.275
Always.

25:55.875 --> 25:59.025
ã2 for broken doors
and smashed windows.

25:59.075 --> 26:00.275
Hm.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.400
Damn soldiers! You owe me Delaney!

26:07.000 --> 26:08.950
Now...

26:09.000 --> 26:12.550
They have reports that say
that some of the robbers were women.

26:14.475 --> 26:16.500
But only the Company are aggrieved,

26:16.550 --> 26:20.650
so no-one can take you to the clink
or to the poultry tower.

26:20.700 --> 26:25.650
So, if a Company man comes calling,

26:25.700 --> 26:27.625
they have no legal jurisdiction.

26:28.875 --> 26:30.225
So you get word to me.

26:35.150 --> 26:37.025
And I will deal with it. In my way.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.625
And in return...

26:44.600 --> 26:45.625
you choose.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.700
Ah!

27:02.750 --> 27:06.575
James Delaney is laughing at us.

27:06.625 --> 27:12.600
The Crown, Coop, the Prince,
all sniggering at us.

27:14.275 --> 27:19.825
Talk of prosecutions for negligence,
investigations...

27:21.550 --> 27:24.150
talk of complicity,

27:24.200 --> 27:28.775
and all the while,
sniggering behind our backs.

27:28.825 --> 27:32.450
Can you hear it?
Coming from down from Regent Street?

27:32.500 --> 27:35.225
Well, we know who. We know why.

27:35.275 --> 27:39.425
We just have to find out where.

27:39.475 --> 27:43.850
And we can use every resource
we have. Every resource.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.850
We are richer than God.

27:45.900 --> 27:51.750
I blaspheme with impunity
because the Company is at my heel.

27:54.750 --> 27:58.850
Now, we've screwed Maharajas,
we've screwed moguls,

27:58.900 --> 28:00.150
and this man...

28:00.200 --> 28:04.225
this man is merely a London mongrel.

28:05.675 --> 28:06.750
So...

28:11.350 --> 28:14.700
Come on! Ideas?

28:29.100 --> 28:30.750
Who's helping Delaney?

28:32.275 --> 28:34.300
Quick, Bill! It's Pearl.

28:35.675 --> 28:37.400
Where's he making the powder?

28:41.025 --> 28:42.675
He'll be East fucking India.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.250
Let it be known
along the Wapping Wall,

29:06.300 --> 29:09.100
it was the work of the devil Delaney.

29:59.675 --> 30:02.350
Ready? Good boy.

30:12.075 --> 30:14.175
What the hell are you doing here,

30:14.225 --> 30:16.500
at whatever the hell time
of night it is?

30:18.400 --> 30:20.200
I thought I heard an explosion.

30:21.700 --> 30:22.750
No.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.550
All is well.

30:28.800 --> 30:29.825
Be careful.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.800
Making gunpowder and being careful
are good bedfellows.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.675
What? What do you see?

30:56.750 --> 30:58.150
He's just scared of you.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.500
Everybody's scared of you.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.225
Thankfully.

31:12.225 --> 31:15.675
Did you find out how much the
Company are offering as reward?

31:17.700 --> 31:18.750
Work faster.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.075
Steady as we go.

31:32.025 --> 31:33.075
Good boy.

32:17.875 --> 32:19.475
What the hell are you doing?

32:22.350 --> 32:24.700
No!

32:24.750 --> 32:27.850
The letters your father wrote
to you are beautiful.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.700
Oh. How would you know that?

32:30.750 --> 32:34.450
Because I read them.
Have you even looked at them?

32:34.500 --> 32:35.550
No.

32:37.675 --> 32:40.425
Pictures and paintings
from all over the world.

32:41.950 --> 32:45.100
The oil in the paint is burning
very nicely, thank you.

32:49.475 --> 32:53.225
I am looking for
a particular document.

32:53.275 --> 32:56.150
A treaty. That is all.

32:56.200 --> 33:01.700
A treaty between my father
and the Nootka Indian tribe.

33:01.750 --> 33:06.850
A treaty in which Nootka land
was bought for gunpowder...

33:06.900 --> 33:08.750
and lies!

33:10.750 --> 33:12.350
Along with my mother.

33:16.025 --> 33:17.225
His first wife.

33:20.350 --> 33:22.000
Who he bought for beads.

33:30.400 --> 33:34.375
And when his wife would not play
the Spanish princess

33:34.425 --> 33:36.950
or the Italian countess,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.625
whatever it was she refused to play...

33:41.875 --> 33:44.625
he had her sent to
Bedlam Insane Asylum.

33:49.275 --> 33:50.550
Ohhh...

34:06.675 --> 34:09.100
Have you never bought
a soul for beads?

34:55.000 --> 34:59.950
I'm told Your Majesty has some
paperwork regarding the East India?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.600
Ah!

35:03.350 --> 35:05.625
Some little Scotsman in the War Office

35:05.675 --> 35:07.300
who wants to crawl up my arse

35:07.350 --> 35:09.200
dug it up and brought it to me.

35:11.625 --> 35:15.250
In time of war, a failure to secure
His Majesty's gunpowder against

35:15.300 --> 35:19.900
the enemy is a criminal offence,
and the same goes for saltpetre.

35:19.950 --> 35:21.900
You wish to charge the
East India with negligence?

35:21.950 --> 35:26.150
Worse. We could allege potential
complicity within the organisation.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.025
Then we can send in inspectors.
We need to shake the impasse.

35:35.425 --> 35:38.650
Why do you always look
down your nose at my plans?

35:38.700 --> 35:42.750
I'm not. We should prosecute
over the lost saltpetre.

35:45.100 --> 35:48.425
You are jealous
of the little Scotsman.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.375
No, Your Highness.

35:53.425 --> 35:54.500
So...

35:54.550 --> 35:57.300
Improve on the little Scotsman.

35:57.350 --> 36:03.825
Oh. A charge of negligence
would be action against the Company.

36:03.875 --> 36:08.250
And Strange would be able
to accommodate it

36:08.300 --> 36:11.100
or allocate blame as he chooses.

36:11.150 --> 36:13.825
A warehouseman or two would hang.

36:15.100 --> 36:19.350
I have begun to believe that
it might be more effective

36:19.400 --> 36:22.700
if we went after Sir Stuart himself.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.700
The night of the robbery I...

36:27.750 --> 36:29.825
I found these...

36:29.875 --> 36:32.300
in a bottom drawer.

36:46.075 --> 36:48.225
Who the devil is George Chichester?

36:52.700 --> 36:54.675
The Sons of Africa?

37:02.150 --> 37:04.225
Excuse me, sir. Sir!

37:04.275 --> 37:06.100
No-one is allowed in here.

37:06.150 --> 37:08.300
There's been an outbreak of cholera.

37:08.350 --> 37:10.775
I am immune.

37:10.825 --> 37:14.550
Tell your doctor I'll be waiting
for him downstairs.

37:27.550 --> 37:31.700
Personally, I question
the miasmatic theory of cholera,

37:31.750 --> 37:34.100
but even so,
it's wise to take precautions.

37:34.150 --> 37:37.600
I'm assuming this disease
is of your own making?

37:39.275 --> 37:43.175
So many soldiers and Company men
treading heavily in your footsteps,

37:43.225 --> 37:47.175
I thought I'd make this place
a little less attractive to them.

37:47.225 --> 37:49.425
That's why we've also moved down here.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.025
I'm busy. What do you want?

37:57.300 --> 37:59.200
You have something I need.

38:02.300 --> 38:05.975
The blockade at Sligo,
running short of gunpowder.

38:06.025 --> 38:09.400
The Irish are being prevented
from running fishing boats.

38:12.950 --> 38:15.575
The bellmen and the newspapers
tell me there's a new source

38:15.625 --> 38:17.450
of prime-grade powder in town.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.100
No royal charter required.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.300
I'm afraid I don't have any powder.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.950
You ride the Hendon road three miles.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.300
There is a pond called The Source.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.650
Beyond that, an area of low land.

38:33.700 --> 38:38.150
Hatchett's Ground they call it.
A tannery.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.625
A windmill.

38:39.675 --> 38:44.475
And hidden just behind that,
a cattle farm with a water wheel.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.225
No organisation is watertight, James.

38:50.675 --> 38:52.225
You're just lucky it's our pot

38:52.275 --> 38:54.750
the informant pissed in
and not the Company's.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.800
Though, we do offer better rewards.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.900
Our guns will fall silent in ten days.

39:01.950 --> 39:03.975
We need powder in eight.

39:04.025 --> 39:06.475
- That's not possible.
- Yes, it is.

39:08.075 --> 39:09.150
Ask your chemist.

39:10.700 --> 39:11.750
Mr. Cholmondeley.

39:13.025 --> 39:15.150
Ask him about the French experiment.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.250
The French experiment was--
How can I put it?

39:23.300 --> 39:26.350
Entirely French
in conception and execution.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.825
And therefore a total disaster.

39:28.875 --> 39:32.950
It was John Company, I think,
and the King who'd just attacked

39:33.000 --> 39:35.825
Mauritius, and the French
needed powder in a hurry.

39:35.875 --> 39:40.200
So the foolish fucking French
added chlorate to the mix.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.025
And?

39:45.100 --> 39:48.050
Well, viewed purely from the
standpoint of making gunpowder

39:48.100 --> 39:51.300
very fast, it was a wild success.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.950
However, if you add chlorate,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.225
you have to stir and stir

40:00.275 --> 40:03.575
and stir, and not stop stirring

40:03.625 --> 40:05.375
round the clock.

40:05.425 --> 40:07.500
You need shifts. And men.

40:07.550 --> 40:10.825
And even with the constant,
careful stirring,

40:10.875 --> 40:15.550
even then, even if you do everything
correctly to the finest degree,

40:15.600 --> 40:17.575
still, potentially...

40:17.625 --> 40:19.100
boom!

40:22.150 --> 40:23.550
As in your premonition.

40:26.225 --> 40:28.700
The French, blew Mauritius

40:28.750 --> 40:30.600
almost in half.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.650
And where do we get this chlorate?

40:36.700 --> 40:39.025
No, no, no.

40:39.075 --> 40:41.350
You need to ask a far
more important question,

40:41.400 --> 40:44.225
which is, where will you get
a chemist insane enough to work

40:44.275 --> 40:47.200
for you if you decide to add fucking
chlorate to these vats?

40:48.875 --> 40:52.700
We either get the chlorate, or we
will all hang in about eight days.

41:02.225 --> 41:04.875
You'd risk the life
of your son for chlorate?

41:08.550 --> 41:09.600
He is, isn't he?

41:11.800 --> 41:12.950
Mm-hm.

41:15.350 --> 41:19.000
They have your name, Mr. Cholmondeley.

41:21.025 --> 41:22.700
They have your name,

41:22.750 --> 41:26.550
and you will be first on the list
of their conspirators.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.100
How do they know so much?

41:32.100 --> 41:33.225
Hm.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.375
Get the chlorate.

41:37.425 --> 41:38.850
Yes?

41:38.900 --> 41:40.350
I will get you men.

42:11.675 --> 42:13.025
James...

42:32.425 --> 42:33.475
You said his name!

42:34.800 --> 42:35.825
In your sleep.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.750
You said his name.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.900
<i>You</i> said his name!

42:43.950 --> 42:45.850
Get him out.

42:45.900 --> 42:48.450
I want him out.

42:48.500 --> 42:52.100
Out! Get him out. Out!

42:55.950 --> 43:01.075
That's right, good girl. Spit him
out, spit, spit, spit him out...

43:14.900 --> 43:18.150
No, no! No!

43:22.600 --> 43:24.425
No, no, no!

43:24.475 --> 43:26.275
Ah!

43:42.875 --> 43:45.750
You need a priest, my dear.

43:58.675 --> 43:59.700
Come.

43:59.750 --> 44:02.425
Mr. George Chichester, Esquire.

44:18.150 --> 44:19.650
I don't.

44:19.700 --> 44:21.375
In the day?

44:21.425 --> 44:22.475
Or the night.

44:41.875 --> 44:44.425
For nine years, Mr. Chichester,

44:44.475 --> 44:48.150
you have been writing to my office
on an annual basis.

44:49.475 --> 44:52.950
Every year, July 10th.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.225
July 20th is the anniversary
of the sinking...

44:55.275 --> 44:57.775
Of the sinking of the sloop
The Influence.

44:57.825 --> 45:00.950
Not the ship's real name, of course.

45:01.000 --> 45:06.175
Its name was changed and papers
altered when it took on human cargo

45:06.225 --> 45:07.950
in the port of Cabinda.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.300
280 souls.

45:14.350 --> 45:17.475
120 men, 84 women...

45:17.525 --> 45:19.925
- Yes, yes, and what is it--
- And...

45:19.975 --> 45:21.525
What is your--

45:21.575 --> 45:24.025
And, sir...

45:26.025 --> 45:27.875
76 children.

45:30.950 --> 45:33.375
All lost.

45:33.425 --> 45:34.475
Drowned.

45:37.275 --> 45:40.450
And what is your interest
in the sinking?

45:40.500 --> 45:42.775
Did you have relatives aboard?

45:47.225 --> 45:49.175
Mr. Coop,

45:49.225 --> 45:51.050
even though I am black,

45:51.100 --> 45:55.000
I am not related by blood
to every slave stolen from Africa.

46:04.075 --> 46:07.850
So, The Sons of Africa.
You write on their behalf.

46:07.900 --> 46:09.900
I write on behalf of humanity.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.775
As a man concerned with injustice.

46:14.825 --> 46:16.650
Against your people.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.225
Against people.

46:20.875 --> 46:24.550
For nine years, you have been
campaigning for a Royal Commission

46:24.600 --> 46:31.825
to investigate the drowning
of these 280 slaves,

46:31.875 --> 46:34.200
which you say was done deliberately.

46:35.200 --> 46:39.750
It is my belief that some
very powerful men in London

46:39.800 --> 46:44.200
were involved in an illicit shipment
of slaves for personal profit,

46:45.225 --> 46:47.775
were complicit in the deaths
of those slaves

46:47.825 --> 46:50.550
and in the subsequent
concealment of the facts.

46:50.600 --> 46:54.575
And you believe that those men
are senior directors

46:54.625 --> 46:57.175
within the Honourable
East India Company?

46:57.225 --> 46:58.625
Yes, I do.

47:01.500 --> 47:04.675
Well then, Mr. Chichester,
I have some good news for you.

47:10.275 --> 47:12.150
From the Prince Regent himself.

47:38.400 --> 47:39.450
Wilton!

47:39.500 --> 47:41.150
To be continued, gentlemen.

47:42.700 --> 47:46.225
Did you receive the box
of bananas I sent you...

47:47.425 --> 47:49.225
You will improve your game.

47:49.275 --> 47:52.625
You have to improve your fucking game!

47:54.400 --> 47:56.575
Those bastards at the palace

47:56.625 --> 48:00.750
have opened a royal commission
into the sinking of The Influence.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.900
The-The-The Influence? Why?

48:02.950 --> 48:06.950
Well, it's a personal campaign.
A stab in my ribs.

48:08.275 --> 48:10.500
Now, you will deal with it.

48:10.550 --> 48:14.500
You and the Africa Desk. Hm?

48:14.550 --> 48:17.825
A commission is not the King,
so they can't subpoena,

48:17.875 --> 48:21.825
so you will deal with it
and treat them with disbelief.

48:23.400 --> 48:28.350
They have appointed some educated
blackamoor to prepare the evidence.

48:28.400 --> 48:31.050
Now, you take your coat off,

48:31.100 --> 48:35.150
go into your office
and you write to him.

48:35.200 --> 48:38.375
Offer him
"full and unfettered co-operation"

48:38.425 --> 48:41.250
on behalf of
the Honourable East India.

48:41.300 --> 48:46.225
No, no, no.
"Full and willing cooperation."

48:46.275 --> 48:48.100
Yes, sir.

48:48.150 --> 48:53.425
And then... I will tell you
which papers to burn.

48:54.700 --> 48:55.750
Sir.

49:11.150 --> 49:13.375
There is a Mr. Delaney
to see you, madam.

49:13.425 --> 49:16.750
He's come from the river.
He's in the garden.

49:18.700 --> 49:22.750
If it's someone you fuck, please
check if he came from east or west.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.300
In the east, there is cholera.

49:24.350 --> 49:26.575
You can catch it from fucking.

49:26.625 --> 49:29.750
It isn't. And there isn't.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.825
And you can't.

49:42.875 --> 49:45.350
I will have your gunpowder
in eight days.

49:46.350 --> 49:48.175
Powder?

49:48.225 --> 49:49.650
Yes.

49:49.700 --> 49:52.025
Dumbarton said the need
was very urgent.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.950
Then it must indeed be urgent.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.025
Hm.

49:59.025 --> 50:02.025
If your business is not gunpowder,
what is it?

50:02.075 --> 50:04.375
My business is the deal.

50:04.425 --> 50:05.775
I sent word of your offer,

50:05.825 --> 50:08.425
with my own recommendation
that we accept.

50:08.475 --> 50:10.025
Accept what?

50:10.075 --> 50:14.025
Nootka landing ground in return
for the tea trade to Canton.

50:14.075 --> 50:15.775
Hm.

50:15.825 --> 50:18.150
And safe passage
through your blockade.

50:19.875 --> 50:23.050
But you must assign the treaty
before you leave London.

50:23.100 --> 50:25.950
Hmm! Well, that would require me
to trust you.

50:28.550 --> 50:30.750
Based on mutual self-interest.

50:32.950 --> 50:34.675
Trust requires a little time.

50:39.750 --> 50:42.500
Something we have very little of,
Mr. Delaney.

50:55.225 --> 50:56.275
What's this?

50:58.950 --> 51:02.375
A book from a Mr. Cholmondeley
for Miss Bow.

51:02.425 --> 51:04.400
It came by post, with a letter.

51:08.025 --> 51:11.025
- She obviously has an admirer.
- Hm.

51:14.300 --> 51:17.175
She asked me a lot of questions today.

51:17.225 --> 51:19.300
And did you give her a lot of answers?

51:22.350 --> 51:23.700
I told her nothing.

51:25.300 --> 51:26.900
And yet, you have so much to tell.

51:28.675 --> 51:31.750
Oh, we need some more coal
for my fireplace. It's freezing!

51:31.800 --> 51:35.850
Why would we do that?
This is the Delaney household.

51:35.900 --> 51:37.300
We have no warmth here.

51:40.750 --> 51:43.625
Mr. Cholmondeley is not
a suitable man for you.

51:43.675 --> 51:46.900
Oh, no, no absolutely not. He's...

51:49.675 --> 51:51.800
You must keep him all to yourself.

51:52.875 --> 51:55.150
I shan't hinder your advances.

52:15.875 --> 52:19.025
Zilpha. My love. My love.

52:23.025 --> 52:27.100
This is a holy man of God.

52:27.150 --> 52:32.000
He's practised in removing
and discouraging demons.

52:33.150 --> 52:37.550
Your husband reports a Barbason
has been visiting you.

52:37.600 --> 52:39.425
There is a ceremony of exorcism

52:39.475 --> 52:42.025
which can eradicate the Barbason.

52:42.075 --> 52:44.900
It's a very short process.
And quite inexpensive.

52:44.950 --> 52:47.150
I told the Priest how he visits you.

52:50.475 --> 52:51.750
No.

52:51.800 --> 52:55.225
- He visits you. He visits you.
- No! No! Don't touch me.

52:55.275 --> 52:58.850
- At least acknowledge that--
- Go to hell!

52:58.900 --> 53:01.950
Goodness. A slight thing she is,
but fearful!

53:04.350 --> 53:06.425
Yes, I see it. I see it.

53:06.475 --> 53:09.300
Is there somewhere
we can pin her down?

53:09.350 --> 53:10.625
Stop! Stop!

53:10.675 --> 53:12.825
<i>Exi ergo, transgressor.</i>

53:12.875 --> 53:15.775
<i>Exi, seductor,
plene omni dolo et fallacia.</i>

53:15.825 --> 53:18.250
<i>E virtutis inimici,
innocentium persecutor. Eda locum,</i>

53:18.300 --> 53:20.575
<i>dirissime, da locum,
impiissime Eda locum Christo,</i>

53:20.625 --> 53:26.300
<i>in quo nihil invenisti
de operibus tuis...</i>

53:26.350 --> 53:32.650
<i>qui te spoliavit Equi regnum
tuum destruxit,</i>

53:32.700 --> 53:37.250
<i>qui te victum ligavit,</i>

53:37.300 --> 53:44.150
<i>et vasa tua diripuit.</i>

53:44.200 --> 53:48.950
You see those blemishes?

53:49.000 --> 53:52.225
It is the evil coming to the surface.

53:55.750 --> 53:57.450
It's almost done, my love.

53:57.500 --> 54:01.050
<i>Exi ergo, transgressor.</i>

54:01.100 --> 54:04.350
<i>Exi, seductor, plene omni dolo
et fallacia, virtutis inimici,</i>

54:04.400 --> 54:05.850
<i>innocentium persecutor.</i>

54:05.900 --> 54:10.850
<i>Da locum, dirissime, da locum,
impiissime.</i>

54:10.900 --> 54:14.350
<i>In nomine Patris,</i>

54:14.400 --> 54:16.625
<i>et Filii,</i>

54:16.675 --> 54:18.750
<i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

54:28.675 --> 54:30.000
<i>Amen.</i>

54:31.000 --> 54:32.025
<i>Amen.</i>

54:38.475 --> 54:40.150
Can we untie her now?

54:41.500 --> 54:42.875
Leave her a few moments.

54:44.225 --> 54:47.875
Let her reflect... and recover.

55:32.750 --> 55:33.900
Will you come to bed?

55:35.700 --> 55:38.150
Yes, of course.
I'll be up in just a moment.

56:07.225 --> 56:08.475
<i>Teach me.</i>

56:13.900 --> 56:15.000
<i>Guide me.</i>

56:28.550 --> 56:29.600
Zilpha?
