ANNOUNCER: We now return
to VH1's <i>Behind the Music:</i>

00:36.837 --> 00:39.338
<i>Dr. Teeth</i>
<i>and the Electric Mayhem.</i>

00:39.340 --> 00:42.374
It must've been around 1979
when Animal started

00:42.376 --> 00:44.476
snorting crushed-up
pieces of felt.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.844
It got pretty ugly.

00:45.846 --> 00:49.381
Me had big problem
before me found God.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.050
He, like, threw me down
and he said,

00:51.052 --> 00:52.718
"I hope your puppeteer
has big hands,

00:52.720 --> 00:54.553
because I'm not using lube."

00:54.555 --> 00:57.823
Me no remember that,
but me believe it happened.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.758
(doorbell rings)
I got it.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.029
Huh, it says "Glenn Quagmire."

01:04.031 --> 01:06.698
But if you squint and imagine
it says "Peter Griffin,"

01:06.700 --> 01:07.833
it says "Peter Griffin."

01:07.835 --> 01:08.867
Peter, it's Quagmire's.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.069
Take it next door.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.503
Now, now, hold on, Lois.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.505
Now, this poses a very
difficult ethical dilemma.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.008
Do I deliver the package
to its rightful owner?

01:16.010 --> 01:18.577
Or do I open it up and see
if it contains He-Mans?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.579
Do not open that box.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.014
You know, Lois,
physicists believe

01:22.016 --> 01:23.682
there are two
alternate universes:

01:23.684 --> 01:25.551
one in which I don't
open the box

01:25.553 --> 01:27.186
and one in which I do.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.555
I'm not gonna open the box.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.523
I'm gonna open the box.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.193
Aw, sweet! It's a whip!

01:34.195 --> 01:36.028
Peter, be careful
with that thing!

01:36.030 --> 01:37.863
Remember, we're renting
this house.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.198
That's depressing.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.100
Wow, I haven't felt
this powerful

01:41.102 --> 01:44.703
since I got to decide which
ant lives and which ant dies.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.105
You shall battle to the death,

01:46.107 --> 01:48.207
and the winner
will be given his freedom.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.042
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:50.044 --> 01:51.877
Peter, would you like
a glass of...?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.112
Oh, my God!

01:53.114 --> 01:56.648
I told you not to play God
with those ants!

01:59.886 --> 02:01.954
All right, Meg,
stay incredibly still.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.056
I'm gonna whip that cigarette
out of your mouth.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.757
And maybe not slice
your face in half.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.392
Dad, I don't
want to do this.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.393
Stay still!

02:08.395 --> 02:09.628
Aah!

02:09.630 --> 02:11.730
Okay, tha-that's
pretty cool, too.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.233
Hey, Dad, that's
a cool hwhip.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.724

too much heat on my neck.

Ooh, a message from Joe.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.331
JOE:
Hey, Cleveland.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.799
I just wanted
to give you a heads-up

02:47.801 --> 02:50.469
that Peter has a whip,
because, well, you know,

02:50.471 --> 02:53.438
given your racial heritage,
it seems like something

02:53.440 --> 02:55.841
you might want
to keep an eye out for.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.109

but the upside is so good,
I'm taking it.

ANNOUNCER:
We now return
to <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales.</i>

03:10.691 --> 03:12.124
Should we bury them?

03:12.126 --> 03:14.359
Nah, leave them
for the buzzards.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.327
I like that guy.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.496
Oh, boy, here comes Harry.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.998
He thinks no one will notice
he got his neck done.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.801
Hey, fellas, I'm back
from that family wedding.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.536
(groans)

03:24.538 --> 03:25.704
Hey, what you watching?

03:25.706 --> 03:26.972
<i>The Outlaw Josey Wales.</i>

03:26.974 --> 03:28.340
It's a Western.
Ah.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.975
When do the cowboys
go into the tent,

03:29.977 --> 03:31.877
lick their palms and
have sex with each other?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.579
Different kind of Western.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.550
Ew! What's Clint Eastwood
doing with that Indian chief?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.018
Oh, they're-they're just
becoming blood brothers.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.987
"Blood brothers"?
What the devil is that?

03:41.989 --> 03:43.822
Well, it's an ancient ritual
where two friends

03:43.824 --> 03:45.991
intermingle their blood,
thus sealing a bond

03:45.993 --> 03:47.559
even deeper than friendship.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.827
Yes, yes. Let's do that.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.495
Brian, I want you inside me.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.064
You-you don't have
to say it like that.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.565
Oh, come on, we're
best friends, right?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.000
Stewie, I'm not...

03:55.002 --> 03:56.168
Actually, we're even
more than best friends.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.736
I mean, we share
the same home.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.571
We've been on countless
adventures together.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.206
And, besides, you
owe me, Brian.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.076
Remember what you did to
my last Halloween costume?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.345
I am going to be
the cutest fire hydrant

04:06.347 --> 04:08.614
in the whole... Aah!
What are you doing?!

04:09.515 --> 04:10.682
(grunts)

04:10.684 --> 04:12.751
Okay, your turn.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.554
(groans)

04:15.556 --> 04:17.256
I think we should
hold hands more often.

There you go,
we're blood brothers now.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.891
You happy?

04:19.893 --> 04:21.193
Actually, yes.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.028
I mean, I really
feel the bond, Brian.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.529
I feel like we're closer now.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.598
You know, more connected,
more intertwined.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.066
Yeah, I guess in a way we are.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.068
Hey, are-are you blood
brothers with Meg

04:30.070 --> 04:31.937
because you ate her
tampon out of the trash?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.806
No, tha... no, that's...
that's something else.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.378
Oh, man, I could
use a cold beer.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.214
Yeah, me, too.
I just had a killer rehearsal.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.882
I'm not biting.
Me, neither.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.385
You forget
how many scenes Tevye's in.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.054
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's this?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.056
That's our booth!

04:51.058 --> 04:52.924
Uh, uh, excuse me.
Hey, fellas.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.793
Uh, hey, listen, this is,
uh, a little awkward,

04:54.795 --> 04:57.095
but, uh, you guys
are sitting in our booth.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.430
Listen here, pencil neck.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.232
This is our booth now,
and we ain't leaving.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.401
So, what are you gonna
do about it, bitch?

05:02.403 --> 05:04.736
Look, dudes, clearly
you don't want to move.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.771
And that's fine.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.406
We'll come back in an hour.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.108
Nice try, wheelie, but this
ain't your booth no more.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.778
That's right, we see you losers
anywhere near this booth,

05:12.780 --> 05:14.913
and we'll bust your kneecaps.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.148
We're willing to take that risk.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.082
Shut up, Joe.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.450
All right,
I was hoping

05:18.452 --> 05:20.485
it wouldn't have
to come to this, but...

05:20.487 --> 05:23.155
you fellas are in big trouble.

05:25.425 --> 05:28.760
If, uh... if you could just
move back like eight feet.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.162
Is that my whip?

05:30.164 --> 05:31.163
Hey!

05:31.165 --> 05:33.265
Is that my Taser?

05:33.267 --> 05:35.600
All right, I'll just strangle
him with this Hawaiian shirt.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.436
Will you stop going
through my mail?!

05:37.438 --> 05:39.671
All right, bitches, either
you tuck your little wangs

05:39.673 --> 05:41.606
between your legs and
waddle out of here

05:41.608 --> 05:44.109
or we're gonna beat
the crap out of you.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.944
So, what's it gonna be?

05:45.946 --> 05:48.580
Uh, I think we're gonna
do the wang thing.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.790
(yawns)

05:58.792 --> 06:00.525

06:00.527 --> 06:02.294
What the hell?

06:02.296 --> 06:03.862
Ow!

06:03.864 --> 06:04.963
Ew!

06:04.965 --> 06:06.732
What's this?

06:08.134 --> 06:09.301
(Stewie yells)

06:09.303 --> 06:10.469
(rapid footsteps approaching)

06:10.471 --> 06:11.803
You son of a bitch!

06:11.805 --> 06:12.971
You gave me herpes!

06:12.973 --> 06:14.306
What?
What are you talking about?

06:14.308 --> 06:16.007
When we swapped blood!
Look at my lip!

06:16.009 --> 06:17.843
It's a disgusting herpes sore!

06:17.845 --> 06:19.044
And now I have some

06:19.046 --> 06:21.480
very uncomfortable
phone calls to make.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.014

Stewie, that's crazy!

06:38.665 --> 06:40.031

06:40.033 --> 06:41.533
Then how do you explain this?!

06:41.535 --> 06:44.202
I don't know.
You're a gross slut.
(gasps)

06:44.204 --> 06:45.504

my fault, Stewie.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.738
I don't even have herpes.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.173
Oh, yeah? Let me see!

06:48.175 --> 06:50.409

you doing? Stop it!

06:51.744 --> 06:54.246
Ugh! Oh, my God!
Look at you!

06:54.248 --> 06:56.014
You're more herpes
than dog!

06:56.016 --> 06:57.249
Okay, fine! I admit it.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.583
I gave you herpes.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.051
You bastard!

07:00.053 --> 07:01.920
You knew you had herpes,
and-and you still agreed

07:01.922 --> 07:03.522
to swap blood with me!

07:03.524 --> 07:05.190
Relax, it's not
that big a deal.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.558
Not that big a deal?!

07:06.560 --> 07:09.361
It's a disgusting,
unsightly, unsavory disease,

07:09.363 --> 07:10.862
and it lasts for life!

07:10.864 --> 07:12.764
Yeah, but, you know, I mean,
isn't the worst thing

07:12.766 --> 07:14.533
about herpes just the stigma?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.401
I mean, like, what if it
wasn't called "herpes"?

07:16.403 --> 07:18.703
Like-like, what if it was
called "boppo," huh?

07:18.705 --> 07:19.905
Oh, I got a little boppo.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.540
Oh, that's cute.
Ah, I want boppo.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.208
You know, my uncle
was in the Army,

07:23.210 --> 07:25.243
and he got genital boppo
from a Saigon whore...

07:25.245 --> 07:26.545
Shut up! Just shut up!

07:26.547 --> 07:27.779
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.047
I mean, look at me.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.116
And on the same day
I'm supposed to help

07:31.118 --> 07:33.218
with my friend's
wedding invitations.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.719
So, I was thinking, I know

07:34.721 --> 07:36.922
they're kind of
overused lately...

07:36.924 --> 07:40.692
but your colors should be,
like, yellow and gray.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.131
You know, I've always been
against destination weddings,

07:46.133 --> 07:49.167
but it's nice
to finally see Denver.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.574
ANNOUNCER:
And now, The History Channel
presents

07:55.576 --> 07:59.678
<i>The Guy who Lived In-Between</i>
<i>the Hatfields and the McCoys.</i>

08:00.580 --> 08:02.080
I'm just going to get my mail.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.249
And I'm not going to ask
who killed my daughter.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.417
It's water under the bridge.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.085
I'm just getting my mail.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.587
Aw, what happened?
I couldn't see.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.821
I have no idea.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.623
The TV is, like,
directly over my head.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.658
All I can see
are the spider veins

08:13.660 --> 08:15.994
of alcoholics wearing shorts.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.165
What?
I said...

08:20.167 --> 08:21.099
Huh?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.434
All I can see is...

08:22.436 --> 08:23.602
What? You can't see what?

08:23.604 --> 08:24.669
I can only see...

08:24.671 --> 08:25.804
What? Damn it, Peter!

08:25.806 --> 08:27.105
Ow!

08:27.107 --> 08:28.006
Joe, what are you
trying to say?!

08:28.008 --> 08:29.174
Eh, it doesn't matter.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.142
I just...
I hate sitting at the bar.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.644
I wish we had
our old booth back.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.778
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

08:33.780 --> 08:34.946
Fight those guys?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.181
They would've kicked our asses.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.616
Peter's right.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.951
We just got to accept
the fact that, well,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.953
we're... we're
kind of cowards.

08:41.955 --> 08:42.854
I know.

08:42.856 --> 08:43.955
Yesterday, I even went

08:43.957 --> 08:45.690
to a Cowards Anonymous meeting.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.993
Hello. My name's Cowardly Lion,

08:47.995 --> 08:49.461
and I'm a coward.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.329
I'm afraid of
small dogs,

08:51.331 --> 08:53.331
girls with pigtails,
flying monkeys...

08:53.333 --> 08:55.467
Wait-wait, th-there's...
there's flying monkeys?

08:55.469 --> 08:57.335
That's a thing?
Sure.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.204
They got sharp
fangs, claws...

08:59.206 --> 09:00.972
God, they sound terrifying!

09:00.974 --> 09:02.474
Wait, you think so, too?

09:02.476 --> 09:05.544
Yes, and fear is a logical
response to actual danger.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.280
Huh. I guess you're right.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.982
Hey. I'm the Rational Lion.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.218
So, (bleep) guys.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.324
Whew, what a morning.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.159
By the time I got done
with my pubes,

09:21.161 --> 09:22.994
I just didn't feel
like shaving anymore.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.529
Hey, Charlotte.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.831
That's very cute, Stewie,
but if I let you dress up

09:26.833 --> 09:30.068
like Héctor Elizondo,
I have to let everyone.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.038
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

09:33.040 --> 09:36.341
Your mouth looks like
the underside of a boat!

09:36.343 --> 09:37.576
(all scream)

09:37.578 --> 09:39.678
Good Lord, nobody wants
to be near me.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.681
This is lonelier
than a Kennedy family reunion.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.083
Where is everybody?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.018
Oh, yeah. They're dead.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.154
(gunshot)

09:51.924 --> 09:55.026
All right, flight attendants,
please prepare for crosscheck.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.561
I'm not crosschecking anything.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.897
I heard what happened
to you at The Drunken Clam.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.199
I'm not doing
what you tell me to do.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.867
I'll do what he tells me to do.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.603
I was in the military
for 30 years

10:04.605 --> 10:05.870
back when that
meant something.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.606
I don't deal
with gay people.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.342
See? Him I respect.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.613
Hey, Bonnie,
you want to fool around?

10:14.615 --> 10:15.947
I bought one of those

10:15.949 --> 10:17.716
crippled-guy robot suits
from <i>Avatar,</i>

10:17.718 --> 10:19.718
so now I can be on top.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.052
No, thanks, Joe.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.554
I heard about what
happened at the Clam,

10:22.556 --> 10:24.556
and I'm not interested
in having sex

10:24.558 --> 10:26.224
with a quarter of a man.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.726
Hey, I'm half a man!

10:27.728 --> 10:29.561
Not anymore.

10:29.563 --> 10:33.064
Fine. Well, I'm gonna
go sleep on the couch.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.399
You need something, Joe?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.635
Yes, Elton, I'd like
to sleep on the couch.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.837
All right, Joe. Come on.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.941
♪ Love lift us up

10:42.943 --> 10:45.844
♪ Where we belong.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.482
Hey, Chris, your mom's
done with the laundry.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.650
Can you help her fold?

10:51.652 --> 10:53.251
No, but you know what?

10:53.253 --> 10:54.786
You put on her bra.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.087
I-I don't want to.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.589
Well, you're gonna.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.257
Everybody heard about what
happened over at the Clam

10:59.259 --> 11:01.326
and how those guys
made you their bitch.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.094
Um, okay.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.263
(whimpering)

11:05.265 --> 11:06.631
That's right, you wuss.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.166
In fact,
the way I see it,

11:08.168 --> 11:09.934
I'm the man
of the house now.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.169
Which means
there's gonna be

11:11.171 --> 11:14.305
some big changes
around here.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.474
It's not very
comfortable, Chris.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.976
My back kind of hurts.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.778
I'm just staring up
at the ceiling.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.945
Shut up!

11:20.947 --> 11:23.581
I promised changes,
and I delivered!

11:26.952 --> 11:30.622
ANNOUNCER:
We now return
to <i>Bryan Cranston Sneezes.</i>

11:30.624 --> 11:32.290
(sneezes)

11:32.292 --> 11:34.526
Thank you.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.462
Um, Rupert?

11:37.464 --> 11:40.965
You know how we promised
never to lie to each other?

11:40.967 --> 11:42.634
Well, I lied earlier tonight.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.704
It's not a burn from
Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.971
It's herpes.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.306
You should get yourself tested.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.674
CHRIS:
Hey, Stewie.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.142
(gasps)
How long have you
been there?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.711
Long enough to know
you have herpes

11:52.713 --> 11:54.979
and do weird stuff
with your teddy bear.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.514
Yeah, he does weird stuff.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.183
I-I just don't stop him.

11:58.185 --> 12:01.319
Yeah, well, I just wanted to
let you know you're not alone.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.954
Oh, yeah? How so?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.358
Good Lord!
You've got herpes, too?

12:07.360 --> 12:10.695
This house is like backstage
at a Whitesnake concert!

12:10.697 --> 12:13.398
Not only that, but I
also got it from Brian.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.166
We're blood brothers, too.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.835
You... you are?

12:16.837 --> 12:19.671
Yup, he knew he had herpes
and he didn't say anything.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.506
Maybe he was mad
I gave him fleas.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.841
I don't know.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.075
That bastard!

12:24.077 --> 12:25.844
Well, we need
to teach him a lesson.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.178
He's a menace.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.981
Like that coked-up giraffe
at Studio 54.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.584
Yup, yup, people are watching.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.819
I'm that good.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.258
Are you Donna Summer?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.693
Why, yes, I am.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.428
I just want to thank you
for helping me reach

12:43.430 --> 12:46.698
a state of cocaine-fueled
1970s euphoria.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.233
Robert Mapplethorpe?

12:48.235 --> 12:50.268
Can I put this fire extinguisher
someplace interesting

12:50.270 --> 12:51.936
and take your picture?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.272
I would love that!

13:02.214 --> 13:04.616
Um, uh, Meg,
can you, um...

13:04.618 --> 13:05.950
can you please
pass the milk?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.051
Shut up, Dad.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.086
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.454
I'm sorry. I'll shut up.
What?!

13:09.456 --> 13:10.722
She-she's right, Lois.
She's right.

13:10.724 --> 13:11.923
I-I don't need milk.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.725
I'll just moisten
my cereal with spit.

13:13.727 --> 13:14.759
(spits)

13:14.761 --> 13:16.060
Mmm, mmm, good spit.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.062
Peter, what the
hell is going on?

13:18.064 --> 13:20.298
Please tell me this isn't still
about how you punked out

13:20.300 --> 13:22.233
in front of those
guys at the Clam.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.301
Oh, God, you're angry.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.402
I'll clean the dishes.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.937
Peter, stop it!

13:25.939 --> 13:27.739
Are... are you crying?

13:27.741 --> 13:28.807
(crying):
No!

13:28.809 --> 13:30.275
Oh, this is insane.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.277
Peter, I want you
to march down to the Clam

13:32.279 --> 13:35.079
right now and get
your booth back.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.081
Oh my God, Lois, you're right.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.918
If they see me crying, they'll
have to give us our booth back.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.254
No! I'm saying you got to go
down there and take it back.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.756
Like a man.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.125
Yeah.
I mean, I mean, yeah!

13:47.127 --> 13:49.661
I am going to the Clam and
I'm getting my booth back.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.095
And, Meg, you're gay.

13:51.097 --> 13:51.996
No, I'm not.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.097
You like guys, right?

13:53.099 --> 13:54.132
Yeah.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.733
Yeah, that's
called being gay.

14:03.475 --> 14:04.509
Hey.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.977
Uh, hey, Kevin.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.947
You, uh... you smell
like a rabbit, buddy.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.949
Did something just
happen with a rabbit?

14:10.951 --> 14:13.451
I'll go get my dad.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.686
Listen, you guys.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.954
I think we're
all suffering

14:15.956 --> 14:17.188
from what happened
down at the Clam.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.623
Yeah, I had to
start taking pills

14:18.625 --> 14:20.625
so I'd stop
thinking about it.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.193
Quagmire, that's a Cialis.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.362
That's right, I'm not
thinking about it anymore.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.464
I'm thinking
about that couch.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.199
Well, I think
we gave up too easy.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.168
We need to march
back down to the Clam

14:30.170 --> 14:31.536
and take back what's ours.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.371
He's right.
We need to sit up to those guys.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.639
No way.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.140
You want to get
yourselves killed,

14:36.142 --> 14:37.208
that's your business,
but I'm not going.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.143
Fine, me and Joe
will go without you.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.712
But just know
you're letting us down.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.313
We're supposed
to stick together.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.949
Like goatee guys
at a barbecue.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.820
Do you mind if I stand next
to you while we eat standing?

14:48.822 --> 14:50.154
No problem.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.656
Hey, let's go grab
some good beer

14:51.658 --> 14:53.892
even though we
brought the bad beer.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.160
NARRATOR:
And these two barbecue scumbags

14:56.162 --> 14:58.029
<i>formed a lifelong friendship</i>

14:58.031 --> 15:01.900
<i>until their deaths</i>
<i>at the ripe old age of 52</i>

15:01.902 --> 15:05.904
<i>in separate ATV accidents.</i>

15:09.341 --> 15:10.909
You know, I'm so glad
you finally agreed

15:10.911 --> 15:12.243
to go out with me, Jenna.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.245
Me, too. I'm having
a really nice time.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.014
You seem like a great guy.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.016
STEWIE:
Yes, thank you, we'll take
the table in the corner,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.183
next to the herpes dog.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.752
Oh, hey, Brian.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.186
And who's your date?

15:22.188 --> 15:24.389
Wow, you must be
such a good person

15:24.391 --> 15:27.592
to knowingly go out with
a herpes-riddled dirtbag.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.928
Ew! I'm sorry, Brian.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.363
I-I've got to go.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.531
Damn it, you guys!

15:33.533 --> 15:35.667
Her dad's really rich!

15:38.904 --> 15:40.238
Wow, you weren't kidding.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.773
Yeah.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.111
PETER:
Hey, you bums!

15:47.113 --> 15:49.080
If you bastards
want our booth,

15:49.082 --> 15:51.215
you got to go
through us to get it.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.618
Smells like this guy's
already wet himself.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.053
Don't flatter yourself.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.454
That was from this morning.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.456
Oh, man, this is gonna be fun.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.725
Yeah, and there's only
two of you losers.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.060
Where's your skinny friend?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.861
(door opens)
QUAGMIRE:
Right here.

16:06.231 --> 16:07.932
Quagmire! You came!

16:07.934 --> 16:09.300
Sure did, Peter.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.468
Thanks for calling me
skinny, by the way.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.903
I realized you
were right.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.404
If we don't stand up
for ourselves now,

16:13.406 --> 16:15.473
we'll regret it
for the rest of our lives.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.576
And this might be the stupidest
thing I've ever done, but...

16:18.578 --> 16:19.577
(grunts)

16:19.579 --> 16:22.347
Oh, now you're gonna get it.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.151
(grunts)

16:32.624 --> 16:34.359
Whelp, I'm out.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.228
Aah!

16:41.800 --> 16:43.434
Hey! That was my pool cue.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.003
I brought it from home.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.504
Oh, sorry.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.972
It screws together.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.141
And I even have
this special little case for it.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.976
I-I feel bad now. I...

16:51.978 --> 16:55.680
Aah!

16:55.682 --> 16:57.015
Hyah!

16:57.017 --> 16:58.783
Hey, that was my
Pawtucket Patriot sign.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.518
I brought it from home.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.021
Okay, now I'm starting
to doubt everything you said.

17:04.456 --> 17:05.823
(grunts)

17:05.825 --> 17:07.492
All right, guys,
I know this looks desperate,

17:07.494 --> 17:10.028
but I've got
this can of spinach.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.276
Aah!

17:46.565 --> 17:48.066
Aw, God, it's all watery.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.700
Aah!

17:49.702 --> 17:51.903
You know, I almost said
"no chairs" at the beginning.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.573
Haven't you guys
had enough?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.342
Why don't you just admit
you're beat and get out of here?

17:58.344 --> 17:59.577
BOTH:
Okay.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.012
No! Never!

18:01.014 --> 18:02.914
We will never stop fighting
for this booth.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.849
This booth is my home.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.350
I was born in this booth.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.752
I was married in this booth.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.021
My children were all conceived
in this booth.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.757
Hell, I witnessed every
significant historical event

18:12.759 --> 18:14.392
in my lifetime right here!

18:14.394 --> 18:16.861
I was in this booth
when the <i>Challenger</i> exploded.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.097
Oh, my God, no!

18:19.099 --> 18:21.199
I was in this booth on 9/11.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.267
Oh, my God, no!

18:23.269 --> 18:26.204
I was in this booth when
President Obama was elected.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.239
Oh, my God, no!

18:28.241 --> 18:30.541
So, if you want this booth,
you're gonna have

18:30.543 --> 18:33.411
to pry it
from my cold, dead hands.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.213
Why are we even bothering
with these idiots?

18:35.215 --> 18:37.949
We're shipping out to
Afghanistan tomorrow.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.450
You guys are soldiers?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.686
It's our
third tour of duty.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.857
(applause)

18:49.228 --> 18:51.896
If I could touch my own head,
I'd salute you.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.965
(grunting)

18:53.967 --> 18:56.300
With his head,
I salute you.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.569
Everyone,
I declare this to be

18:58.571 --> 19:00.471
These Three Guys Day.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.407
And not
These Three Guys Day.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.710
(cheering)

19:11.750 --> 19:15.520
I can't believe I have
to root for Afghanistan now.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.991
(computer chimes)

19:19.993 --> 19:21.392
Ah, damn it!

19:23.996 --> 19:25.596
Stewie! Chris!

19:25.598 --> 19:26.797
Yes, Brian?

19:26.799 --> 19:28.599
You hacked my
Facebook account!

19:28.601 --> 19:30.768
Oh, yes, we actually just
changed your profile picture.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.203
(computer dings)

19:34.439 --> 19:36.607
Aah! Damn it!
Look, enough, okay?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.509
What the hell do you
guys want from me?!

19:38.511 --> 19:39.777
I want to drive
your Prius

19:39.779 --> 19:41.979
to the end of the block
all by myself.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.447
That's it?
Yes.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.016
Okay.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.918
Yay!

19:48.120 --> 19:50.254
(engine starts)

19:54.960 --> 19:57.695
That's, uh... that's way past
the end of the block.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.963
Yeah, his room's empty.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.298
I don't think
he's coming back.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.465
Huh.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.800
Well, what about you?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.669
I want to go on a date
with Neve Campbell

20:04.671 --> 20:07.138
so I can give her a
nice ladle of Stew.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.707
What? How am I supposed
to even find her?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.876
Damn it, Stewie, why are you
being so vindictive?

20:11.878 --> 20:14.312
Because, Brian,
for the first time in my life,

20:14.314 --> 20:16.347
I realized I couldn't trust you.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.584
I couldn't trust
my own best friend.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.187
(sighs)
I... I'm sorry, Stewie.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.856
You're right. I let you down.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.326
I guess... I guess
I was just too embarrassed

20:28.328 --> 20:29.727
to admit I had herpes.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.662
It was a rotten thing to do,

20:31.664 --> 20:34.332
and I promise I will
never lie to you again.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.900
Thanks, Brian.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.902
That's all I really wanted.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.338
So, do you forgive me?

20:40.340 --> 20:42.640
Yes. I do.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.245
So, I'm gonna have herpes
for the rest of my life, huh?

20:47.247 --> 20:49.747
Yeah, but most of the time,
it won't even be an issue.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.882
It only really flares up
during periods of great stress.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.685
Like your wedding day
or a big job interview.

20:54.687 --> 20:58.356
So, what would you say some
of your weaknesses are?

20:58.358 --> 21:00.925
That... that-that's
probably one of them.
