WEBVTT

00:07.711 --> 00:10.627
( theme music playing )

00:14.461 --> 00:17.544
No hanky-panky,
Mr. Beshraavi,

00:17.544 --> 00:19.461
from man or bird.

00:19.461 --> 00:22.044
Believe him, Nejim.
He means it.

00:22.044 --> 00:23.878
He said
he'd kill me.

00:23.878 --> 00:26.544
( zipping luggage )

00:26.544 --> 00:28.211
( door opens )

00:28.211 --> 00:30.378
( rustling )

00:30.378 --> 00:32.878
Pollack:
Get him, Mustafa.

00:32.878 --> 00:35.295
Hey, hold that door!
Hold that door!

00:35.295 --> 00:38.420
- ( chatter over PA )
- Flight 3-- what?
Hold the door!

00:38.420 --> 00:40.711
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's my flight
to Los Angeles!

00:40.711 --> 00:42.836
- I'm so sorry.
You just missed it.
- I'm on that flight.

00:42.836 --> 00:44.752
- Look, I made
the plane, I'm here!
- You were so close...

00:44.752 --> 00:47.211
- What?!
- ...but unfortunately,
the door is locked and closed.

00:47.211 --> 00:48.669
- You're not
letting me on the plane?
- I know it's frustrating,

00:48.669 --> 00:50.211
but once the door closes,
that's it.

00:50.211 --> 00:51.461
Federal regulations.

00:51.461 --> 00:54.544
I got caught up watching
this movie in the hotel,

00:54.544 --> 00:58.086
"Arabesque,"
with Sophia Loren
and Gregory Peck.

00:58.086 --> 00:59.961
- Mm-hmm.
- Please let me in here.

00:59.961 --> 01:02.086
It's so ridiculous.
There's the plane
right there.

01:02.086 --> 01:05.128
But, really, it's as if
the plane's not there.

01:05.128 --> 01:06.836
Wha-- are you
a magician?

01:06.836 --> 01:08.794
- No, but the door is locked.
- I see the plane.

01:08.794 --> 01:10.794
If you're doing a trick,
it's not a good trick.

01:10.794 --> 01:12.794
I'm trying my best
to accommodate you.

01:12.794 --> 01:14.627
It doesn't seem like it.
You're not golden-ruling it.

01:14.627 --> 01:17.128
You're not doing unto others
as you would have others
do unto you.

01:17.128 --> 01:20.378
Unfortunately,
the golden rule is not
a federal regulation.

01:20.378 --> 01:22.086
Golden rule
trumps everything.

01:22.086 --> 01:24.961
Golden rule's on top,
federal law is second.

01:24.961 --> 01:28.502
Good news--
we do have one seat left

01:28.502 --> 01:30.003
on the next
available flight.

01:30.003 --> 01:33.669
- First class?
- No, but it's an aisle seat,

01:33.669 --> 01:34.836
which is kind of
a miracle.

01:34.836 --> 01:36.669
So you do have
a little time

01:36.669 --> 01:39.461
to enjoy our
amazing mall here.

01:39.461 --> 01:42.211
- We have
a Wetzel's Pretzels...
- A Wetzel's Pretzels.

01:42.211 --> 01:46.836
- I can't wait to chomp into one
of those Wetzel's Pretzels.
- They're delicious.

01:48.502 --> 01:50.586
- Good afternoon.
Welcome aboard.
- Hi.

01:50.586 --> 01:52.836
11C-- straight down
and on the right, sir.

01:52.836 --> 01:55.211
Are there any
first-class seats open?

01:55.211 --> 01:56.502
No, it's a full
flight, sir.

01:56.502 --> 02:00.378
Look, there's
an empty seat over here.

02:00.378 --> 02:02.211
Straight down,
right-hand side.

02:02.211 --> 02:04.336
- Hello.
- If somebody
doesn't show up, though,

02:04.336 --> 02:06.461
you let me know, okay?

02:06.461 --> 02:08.336
And, you know,
we can work something out.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.919
I can pay you
separately, perhaps.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.211
Attendant: Go to your seat,
please, sir.
Thank you.

02:17.211 --> 02:19.336
Hey, what are you doing?
I just opened this up for me.

02:19.336 --> 02:20.878
- What are you doing?
- That's my spot right there.

02:20.878 --> 02:22.378
I don't care.
That doesn't mean anything.

02:22.378 --> 02:23.711
This is filled up.
I'm using this.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.003
I don't know
what to tell you, buddy.

02:25.003 --> 02:26.044
It's the Wild West,
okay, so.

02:28.086 --> 02:30.378
( grunting )

02:35.378 --> 02:37.044
( sighs )

02:37.044 --> 02:38.420
Larry.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.378
- Nathan Winocur.
- Hey, Doctor.

02:40.378 --> 02:42.086
- Friend of Marty's.
- Yeah.

02:42.086 --> 02:44.086
- Good to see ya.
- Nice to see you.

02:44.086 --> 02:45.586
Ocean View, right?

02:45.586 --> 02:47.836
That's right.
We should play a round.

02:47.836 --> 02:50.211
- We should play.
- Let's do that.
I'll talk to Marty.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.669
- And I'll get Jeff.
You know Jeff?
- I love Jeff.

02:52.669 --> 02:55.044
- That's a great foursome.
- Yeah, it's a good foursome.

02:55.044 --> 02:57.086
- Nathan: Great.
- Uh, I think I'm there.

02:57.086 --> 03:00.420
Okay, that's me.
Thank you.

03:16.502 --> 03:19.044
Attendant: Sir, sir, I'm sorry.
This is for first-class
passengers.

03:19.044 --> 03:22.086
- I know, but I-- I...
- Your ticket's for 11C, sir.

03:22.086 --> 03:23.544
I know, but nobody's
sitting there.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.336
Could you give me, like,
a personal upgrade,

03:25.336 --> 03:27.420
and I can
upgrade you, and...

03:27.420 --> 03:29.919
- Sir.
- No? Okay.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.461
( sighs )

03:33.461 --> 03:36.003
Sir, can I ask you
a really big favor?

03:36.003 --> 03:38.752
I have
a medical condition

03:38.752 --> 03:41.961
where I have to--
my bladder's really
overactive.

03:41.961 --> 03:43.627
I have a bladder
condition,

03:43.627 --> 03:45.794
and I have
to get up a lot.

03:45.794 --> 03:47.669
Is there any way
I could sit in the aisle

03:47.669 --> 03:49.794
and you would want
to switch to the middle?

03:49.794 --> 03:52.086
I can't switch seats
with you.

03:52.086 --> 03:54.502
I mean, I got the--
I can't sit in the middle.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.502
It's claustro--
claustrophobic in there.

03:56.502 --> 03:59.669
It's okay.
I just have to ask
because I'm up so often.

03:59.669 --> 04:00.961
- I'm sorry.
- I'll die in the middle.

04:00.961 --> 04:02.669
It's so painful, too.

04:02.669 --> 04:05.003
Just wanna see where
the bathrooms are so I know,

04:05.003 --> 04:07.336
- 'cause it's gonna be a run.
- ( sighs ) Okay, fine.

04:07.336 --> 04:09.711
Really?

04:09.711 --> 04:12.544
You are such a gentleman.
Thank you so much.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.502
You're welcome.

04:14.878 --> 04:17.003
Heh-hey,
my lucky day.

04:17.003 --> 04:19.836
( scoffs )
Yeah, mine, too.

04:19.836 --> 04:23.295
( man coughing )

04:26.336 --> 04:28.044
I'm just looking
for the little thing.

04:28.044 --> 04:31.044
- Nathan: Gotta buckle up.
- ( sighs ) Jesus Christ.

04:31.044 --> 04:32.669
Nathan:
Give it here.

04:44.211 --> 04:46.170
Oh, come on.

04:46.170 --> 04:48.336
( coughing )

04:48.336 --> 04:49.836
Can I grab one
of your Kleenex, please?

04:49.836 --> 04:51.211
Oh.

04:51.211 --> 04:53.461
I just got-- I think
it's just allergies.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.295
( sniffles )

04:55.295 --> 04:57.211
( blows nose )

04:57.211 --> 04:59.044
Oh, man.

04:59.044 --> 05:01.211
( coughing )

05:05.211 --> 05:07.086
No. No.

05:07.086 --> 05:08.086
No.

05:13.003 --> 05:14.711
Attendant:
Sir, if I could just
have you open your eyes

05:14.711 --> 05:16.919
- so I can see your pupils.
- ( man groans )

05:16.919 --> 05:19.502
If you could just try
and relax a little bit.

05:19.502 --> 05:21.961
- Long, deep breaths.
- Attendant #2 over PA:
Excuse me, everyone.

05:21.961 --> 05:24.044
One of our passengers
has taken ill.

05:24.044 --> 05:25.669
If there's
a doctor onboard,

05:25.669 --> 05:28.253
can you please ring
your call button?

05:28.253 --> 05:29.961
Attendant: Now, sir,
are you currently...

05:29.961 --> 05:32.420
Hey, they're asking
for a doctor.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.627
- Mm-mmm.
- Huh?

05:34.627 --> 05:35.878
You're not gonna
heed the call?

05:35.878 --> 05:38.170
Give it a minute.
He's gonna be fine.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.711
( scoffs )
How do you know?
You don't even know what he has.

05:40.711 --> 05:43.420
You ever been part
of an emergency landing?
Is that what you want, Larry?

05:43.420 --> 05:45.711
To spend the night
in Lubbock, Texas,
at a Days Inn

05:45.711 --> 05:47.961
with a $15 voucher
from Cinnabon?

05:47.961 --> 05:49.878
Think about it.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.544
( scoffs )

05:54.752 --> 05:56.420
Excuse me.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.919
I'd like to use
the bathroom.

05:57.919 --> 05:59.461
( groans )
Okay.

05:59.461 --> 06:01.086
- Here.
- Thank you.

06:04.627 --> 06:06.461
Yeah, don't--
don't move too much.

06:06.461 --> 06:08.211
- Don't get up.
- ( sighs )

06:08.211 --> 06:09.752
Ow!

06:09.752 --> 06:13.044
Ah! Why don't
you move your foot,
for God's sake?!

06:16.295 --> 06:18.128
I'm so glad
I ran into you
on this flight.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.586
I'll call up Marty.
We'll set up a game.

06:19.586 --> 06:21.170
Yeah, yeah,
we'll play.

06:21.170 --> 06:23.128
Oh, you got up.

06:23.128 --> 06:25.794
By the way,
that's the first time that
you got up the entire trip.

06:25.794 --> 06:28.295
That was a total bullshit
story about the bladder.

06:28.295 --> 06:30.878
- I have a medical
condition.
- Medical.

06:30.878 --> 06:32.461
( mocking )
You got a medical
condition.

06:32.461 --> 06:34.336
She's got
a medical condition.

06:34.336 --> 06:36.253
One day, you're--
you're gonna really
have to go to the bathroom,

06:36.253 --> 06:37.461
and no one's
gonna let you.

06:37.461 --> 06:39.044
I had to sit
in the middle

06:39.044 --> 06:40.669
the entire trip
because of you!

06:47.961 --> 06:49.170
Thank you.

06:53.295 --> 06:55.086
Welcome back.

06:55.086 --> 06:57.128
- Thank you.
- ( chuckles )

06:57.128 --> 06:59.544
Nice to be home.
Is that your handiwork?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.295
Fuck, no.
I wouldn't
do that shit.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.836
You know what,
that's not gonna
make me wash a car.

07:03.836 --> 07:05.420
If anything,
I'm not gonna wash it.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.378
- I wouldn't wash it.
- Just to annoy this guy.

07:07.378 --> 07:09.627
I assume it's a guy.
A woman wouldn't do
something like that.

07:09.627 --> 07:10.836
Ladies don't do
that kind of shit.

07:10.836 --> 07:13.627
Ladies bust windows out
and slash tires

07:13.627 --> 07:15.003
and key your car
and shit.

07:15.003 --> 07:17.336
"Wash me."
This is what I'm gonna do.

07:19.502 --> 07:20.794
- ( chuckles )
I like that shit.
- Huh?

07:20.794 --> 07:22.669
You like that?
See the comma after "no"?

07:22.669 --> 07:24.003
- No!
- That's good grammar.

07:24.003 --> 07:25.752
- You wash me!
You wash me!
- Yeah.

07:25.752 --> 07:27.086
- Yeah.
- I like that shit.

07:27.086 --> 07:29.586
Hey, did you ever see
this movie "Arabesque"?

07:29.586 --> 07:31.752
Nah. Is that one
of those "Star Trek" movies?

07:31.752 --> 07:34.378
No, no.
It's an old movie
with Sophia Loren.

07:34.378 --> 07:36.836
- She's gorgeous.
- Is she naked in the movie?

07:36.836 --> 07:38.295
No, it was--
it was from the '60s.

07:38.295 --> 07:39.919
Nobody-- nobody
got naked in the '60s.

07:39.919 --> 07:41.752
She's gotta be naked
in something.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.586
Well, if you come
across anything,
let me know.

07:43.586 --> 07:44.669
You know I'ma look.

07:46.211 --> 07:48.711
He refused
to see the person?

07:48.711 --> 07:50.669
He did not
heed the call!

07:50.669 --> 07:52.086
I don't know
what happened
on the plane,

07:52.086 --> 07:54.128
but he's a great guy
to play golf with.

07:54.128 --> 07:55.295
Very surprising.

07:55.295 --> 07:56.544
Do you care
about the character

07:56.544 --> 07:57.878
of people
you play golf with

07:57.878 --> 07:59.502
if they leave you alone
on the course?

07:59.502 --> 08:01.211
No, I'm happy to play
with a reprobate

08:01.211 --> 08:02.378
if he has
a good personality

08:02.378 --> 08:03.378
and I enjoy
playing with him.

08:03.378 --> 08:04.461
I'll play
with reprobates.

08:04.461 --> 08:06.253
- Yeah?
- Oh, really?

08:06.253 --> 08:08.711
- Yes.
- You, Manson,
Ramirez, and Hitler.

08:08.711 --> 08:11.170
- That's a good foursome.
- If they play fast.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.544
- If they play fast.
- I'd rather play with
a fast Manson

08:13.544 --> 08:15.627
than a slow Funkhouser,
I'll tell you that.

08:15.627 --> 08:18.711
- Any day of the week.
- Yeah, you're a little slow.

08:18.711 --> 08:20.919
I line my ball up,
I look, I hit it.

08:20.919 --> 08:24.253
Hey, Lar, did I tell you
that we hired a decorator
for the new house?

08:24.253 --> 08:27.128
I'm going up to meet her
Sunday in San Francisco.

08:27.128 --> 08:28.836
Jeff, you're taking me
to the airport, 1:00.

08:28.836 --> 08:31.003
Don't forget.
Don't make any plans.

08:31.003 --> 08:33.170
- Airport-- oh, God.
- Why does he have to take you
to the airport?

08:33.170 --> 08:35.378
- He's gotta see me off.
- See you off?

08:35.378 --> 08:37.669
You're not going to India.
You're going to San Francisco!

08:37.669 --> 08:39.295
- It's an hour away.
- So what?

08:39.295 --> 08:40.919
See you off?
You'll be back that night.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.086
You know what, Larry,
it's not surprising to me

08:43.086 --> 08:45.919
that you're
the only one of this group
who's here as a single...

08:45.919 --> 08:47.752
- ( chuckles ) Oh, yeah.
- ...with no girlfriend,
no wife.

08:47.752 --> 08:50.961
Maybe if you would've seen
Cheryl off a few more times,

08:50.961 --> 08:53.044
- you'd still be together.
- I don't think so.

08:53.044 --> 08:56.128
- He wants to, trust me.
- No, trust me, he doesn't.

08:56.128 --> 08:58.086
- Jeff, do you want to?
- No.

08:58.086 --> 09:00.295
- Well, you're going to.
- You know why you're
doing this?

09:00.295 --> 09:02.961
- Why, Larry?
- Because you wanna
ruin his day, that's why.

09:02.961 --> 09:04.961
Susie:
Okay, Kreskin.
Could read my mind.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.461
You think you know
what goes on

09:06.461 --> 09:08.336
in the complexities
of my brain

09:08.336 --> 09:10.752
and who I am.

09:10.752 --> 09:13.378
- The complexities
of who you are?
- Mm-hmm.

09:13.378 --> 09:16.586
Who are you?
You're a Jew from the Bronx!

09:16.586 --> 09:18.420
Jeff:
I can't wait
to see her off.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.752
- I really like your friends.
- They're very lovely people.

09:20.752 --> 09:23.461
Okay!

09:23.461 --> 09:26.461
Please do not sit
on the arm of the chair.

09:28.919 --> 09:30.461
Dinner is served.

09:30.461 --> 09:32.336
- Yeah, all right.
- Susie: Yay, yay.

09:32.336 --> 09:33.794
- Jeff: Yeah!
- I like it.

09:33.794 --> 09:36.378
- Did you fucking catch that?
- I caught it!

09:36.378 --> 09:37.836
What the fuck?

09:37.836 --> 09:40.794
Oh, oh, oh.
Honey, you forgot
your drink.

09:42.086 --> 09:43.627
Thanks.

09:43.627 --> 09:45.836
Susie:
Oh, Marilyn,
the table's gorgeous!

09:45.836 --> 09:47.044
- Hey.
- Huh?

09:47.044 --> 09:49.794
You ever called her
honey before?

09:49.794 --> 09:51.919
I doubt it.
No.

09:51.919 --> 09:53.128
How many dates
have you been on?

09:53.128 --> 09:54.336
- Two.
- Pssh!

09:54.336 --> 09:56.669
You just gave
a premature honey.

09:56.669 --> 09:57.836
I gotta tell you
something.

09:57.836 --> 09:59.044
- A premature honey?
- Yeah.

09:59.044 --> 10:00.794
Premature,
too soon for honey.

10:00.794 --> 10:02.420
Honey's way down
the line.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.128
You gotta spend
a weekend together

10:04.128 --> 10:06.711
or something in the country
before you can jump to honey.

10:06.711 --> 10:08.170
I know what
you're trying to do,

10:08.170 --> 10:09.794
you're trying to jump ahead
with the relationship.

10:09.794 --> 10:12.253
But it doesn't work.
You got caught.

10:12.253 --> 10:14.502
- You're blowing this
way out of proportion.
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:14.502 --> 10:16.378
- She doesn't care,
Dr. Phil.
- Okay.

10:16.378 --> 10:18.420
You don't know what
you're talking about.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.086
- I think
you made a big mistake.
- Everything is cool, man.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.919
Can I take
a moment, please?

10:22.919 --> 10:25.752
On behalf of my adorable
new girlfriend,

10:25.752 --> 10:28.086
thank you for
a delicious dinner.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.586
- Thank you for coming.
- Cheers.

10:29.586 --> 10:30.794
Richard:
Cheers. Prego.

10:30.794 --> 10:32.253
Marty, cheers.

10:32.253 --> 10:33.919
- Marty: Health, happiness.
- So nice to meet you.

10:33.919 --> 10:35.711
- Thank you for having us.
- Marty: Yes, very nice.

10:35.711 --> 10:37.544
- You can't clink, Larry?
- Why do I have to clink?

10:37.544 --> 10:39.336
Because it's a custom
that people do,

10:39.336 --> 10:40.544
- which is friendly and nice.
- It's a stupid custom.

10:40.544 --> 10:42.295
What does it mean,
the clinking?

10:42.295 --> 10:44.253
- Oh.
- Richard: Cheers.

10:44.253 --> 10:45.961
Mmm.

10:45.961 --> 10:49.878
You know, you pick up
a knife like this,
a steak knife,

10:49.878 --> 10:52.461
you get the urge--
I do-- that I wanna--

10:52.461 --> 10:55.295
I wanna stab--
I wanna stab with it.

10:55.295 --> 10:57.003
- Oh?
- Jeff: Really?

10:57.003 --> 10:59.044
Yeah, 'cause
you pick up a baseball bat,
you wanna swing it.

10:59.044 --> 11:01.003
You pick up a tennis ball,
you wanna throw it.

11:01.003 --> 11:02.627
When you have a--
a knife,

11:02.627 --> 11:04.420
you wanna stab,
do you not?

11:04.420 --> 11:06.378
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Huh? Know what they
should have?

11:06.378 --> 11:09.044
- Richard: What's that?
- A stabbing range.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.794
- Richard: Get out of here.
- Yeah, a stabbing range
where you can stab--

11:11.794 --> 11:13.378
- stab dummies.
- Richard: Wow.

11:13.378 --> 11:14.919
Larry:
You'd feel good.
You'd feel good.

11:14.919 --> 11:16.378
Where would
the stabbing range be?

11:16.378 --> 11:18.878
- In the Valley.
- ( all laughing )

11:18.878 --> 11:20.502
What do you think,
Marilyn?

11:20.502 --> 11:22.295
The knife--
do you feel like
stabbing somebody?

11:22.295 --> 11:24.461
Yeah, I feel like
stabbing someone.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.295
Hmm, interesting.

11:29.295 --> 11:31.044
Richard:
This is fantastic food.

11:31.044 --> 11:32.752
- Thank you.
- It really is.

11:32.752 --> 11:35.295
Woman:
Yeah, I can never
get my potatoes like that.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.878
- Marilyn: Mmm.
- Woman: They're really good.

11:36.878 --> 11:38.836
What is this, tap?

11:38.836 --> 11:40.420
Yes, it is.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.669
Larry:
No filter?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.003
No filter.
Tap water.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.170
Huh, interesting.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.086
Surprised you don't
have a filter.

11:47.086 --> 11:48.836
You have no filter.

11:48.836 --> 11:51.086
- ( chuckles )
Huh, that's-- yeah.
- Isn't it obvious?

11:51.086 --> 11:54.003
- That's true.
- You just say whatever
comes into your mind.

11:54.003 --> 11:57.295
You don't really modulate
your inner feelings
at all, do you?

11:57.295 --> 11:59.961
It's a good thing for me,
but it's a bad thing for water.

11:59.961 --> 12:03.420
Excuse me,
I smell something burning.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.752
- Richard: LD.
- Hmm?

12:06.752 --> 12:09.752
Goldfish
would commit suicide
in this water.

12:09.752 --> 12:13.128
( scoffs ) Yeah!
Wha-- how come you didn't
say that when she was there?

12:13.128 --> 12:15.044
You know, I'm a guest.
I don't know.

12:15.044 --> 12:17.003
You're like Fred MacMurray
in "The Caine Mutiny"

12:17.003 --> 12:19.502
when he and Van Johnson
go to see the admiral,

12:19.502 --> 12:21.627
then Fred MacMurray
gets cold feet and
he backs out.

12:21.627 --> 12:23.128
That's a movie,
this is real life.

12:23.128 --> 12:25.336
In real life,
you're polite
to your hostess.

12:25.336 --> 12:27.669
Of course, you're polite.
And why wouldn't you be?

12:27.669 --> 12:29.378
There's a hostess,
and you have...

12:29.378 --> 12:30.794
- Jeff: That's pretty good.
- ( laughter )

12:30.794 --> 12:32.669
Larry:
Sure, sure,
the water, the water.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.544
By the way,
I'm not the only one
who can't stand it.

12:35.836 --> 12:38.044
Can't stand what?

12:40.461 --> 12:42.711
Well, Marty
likes my water.

12:52.544 --> 12:55.128
( slurping )

12:57.711 --> 13:00.003
- ( muffled ) Very good.
- See?

13:00.003 --> 13:02.295
You're really
the only person

13:02.295 --> 13:04.003
who has a problem
with the water.

13:04.003 --> 13:06.336
You know, it's just water.
What are you so sensitive about?

13:06.336 --> 13:08.003
I want you to go.

13:08.003 --> 13:10.420
( chuckles )
I'm getting kicked out?

13:10.420 --> 13:13.003
- Marilyn: Yeah, I think...
- You're kicking me out?

13:13.003 --> 13:14.669
Yeah, I think
you should leave.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.627
This is unbelievable.
Okay.

13:16.627 --> 13:19.170
Well, it was fun.
We-- we really--

13:19.170 --> 13:22.044
- It was not fun.
- No, it wasn't.

13:22.044 --> 13:23.878
I leave my knife

13:23.878 --> 13:27.253
and I bid you adieu.

13:48.170 --> 13:50.752
( whistling tune )

13:52.336 --> 13:54.378
You guys, look! Ah!

13:54.378 --> 13:58.295
- Boy: Hey, bald fuck!
- Kids: Bald fuck!

13:58.295 --> 14:01.420
Blow me, blow me!

14:01.420 --> 14:03.752
( kids shouting )

14:03.752 --> 14:06.086
Larry:
You wash it!
You wash it!

14:06.086 --> 14:08.003
Blow me,
bald fuck!

14:08.003 --> 14:09.420
Shut up!
Shut up!

14:10.919 --> 14:12.711
Richard:
Oh, you were right, Larry.

14:12.711 --> 14:14.295
I blew it
with Rhonda.

14:14.295 --> 14:16.086
I told you it was
a premature honey.

14:16.086 --> 14:18.752
And she's been cold
ever since.

14:18.752 --> 14:21.003
- Yeah, it was bad.
- I said honey.

14:21.003 --> 14:23.086
- What's the big deal?
- I told them no mushrooms
in this thing.

14:23.086 --> 14:25.170
- I said
no mushrooms, all right?
- I've lost a potential bride,

14:25.170 --> 14:26.919
and you're talking
about salad?

14:26.919 --> 14:30.627
- I blew it.
- You saw-- you saw
a wife there

14:30.627 --> 14:33.836
and you seized on it
with a honey, right?

14:33.836 --> 14:35.420
- That's what you did.
- It was a seize.

14:35.420 --> 14:36.752
- You seized.
- I did seize.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.253
- You did seize.
- So, what do I do?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.502
- I don't know.
- ( phone chimes )

14:39.502 --> 14:41.502
Oh, great.

14:41.502 --> 14:43.420
It's from Rhonda.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.420
"We need to talk."

14:45.420 --> 14:47.627
- Oh.
- I'm through.

14:47.627 --> 14:48.836
You're done.

14:48.836 --> 14:50.711
What ever comes good
after "we need to talk"?

14:50.711 --> 14:53.295
- Nothing.
- You ever hear this?
"We need to talk.

14:53.295 --> 14:54.961
I'm taking you
to Cancun."

14:54.961 --> 14:56.502
- No, that's not happening.
- Is that gonna happen?

14:56.502 --> 14:58.669
- No. No.
- That's not gonna happen.

14:58.669 --> 15:01.211
- What do I do, man?
- Server: Can I get you
a refill?

15:01.211 --> 15:02.711
- Okay.
- What do I do?

15:02.711 --> 15:05.211
I got an idea.
Text her back.

15:05.211 --> 15:06.961
Tell her to come meet you
at the restaurant.

15:06.961 --> 15:08.544
- Why?
- When she comes in,

15:08.544 --> 15:10.961
you start calling
everybody honey.

15:10.961 --> 15:13.128
- I do what?
- Call everybody honey--

15:13.128 --> 15:16.170
the waitresses, the manager,
customers, everyone.

15:16.170 --> 15:18.919
- Why?
- Because--
'cause you're a guy

15:18.919 --> 15:21.295
who just uses
the word honey a lot.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.378
- You mean it's part of
my working vocabulary?
- Yes! Yes!

15:24.378 --> 15:26.086
And what would that
mean to her?

15:26.086 --> 15:28.211
That means that she's just
part of the honey parade.

15:28.211 --> 15:29.794
- So, I just
call everybody honey?
- You call everybody honey.

15:29.794 --> 15:31.627
- I like the honey parade.
- Huh?

15:31.627 --> 15:33.836
- All right,
I'll have her come down.
- Yeah.

15:35.627 --> 15:36.878
Larry:
There, she's coming.
There she is.

15:36.878 --> 15:38.586
- Where?
- There.

15:38.586 --> 15:40.544
- Oh, boy.
- Larry, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

15:40.544 --> 15:41.711
- Hi!
- Hi.

15:41.711 --> 15:43.170
Hi. Oh,
hold on a second.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.253
Honey, do you mind
if I grab a chair?

15:45.253 --> 15:49.461
- Thank you, honey.
- Oh, no, I don't--
um, thanks.

15:49.461 --> 15:51.003
I just--
I could come back.

15:51.003 --> 15:54.044
I just wanted to have
just, like, a quick
conversation.

15:54.044 --> 15:55.669
I don't wanna interrupt
a whole thing.

15:55.669 --> 15:57.336
No, you're not
interrupting anything.

15:57.336 --> 15:59.170
Excuse me, honey.
Can I get...

15:59.170 --> 16:01.420
- What-- what do you want?
- Oh, I'll just have a coffee.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.586
A black coffee,
honey.

16:04.586 --> 16:06.878
That's all you want?
Are you hungry?

16:06.878 --> 16:09.544
Uh, well,
I wasn't planning
on staying that long,

16:09.544 --> 16:11.669
- but maybe--
maybe I'll get a sand--
- Oh, honey, right here.

16:11.669 --> 16:13.211
- The coffee.
- Oh, thank you so much.

16:13.211 --> 16:16.878
Honey, can you bring
a turkey burger
and some fries?

16:16.878 --> 16:18.461
Thanks, honey.
Hey, hon!

16:18.461 --> 16:20.378
You know, honey,
can we get an extra napkin?

16:20.378 --> 16:22.211
Hey, could I get
some coffee, honey?

16:22.211 --> 16:23.794
- Mm-hmm.
- Honey? Honey?

16:23.794 --> 16:24.878
Thank you, honey.

16:24.878 --> 16:26.544
Could we get
the check, honey?

16:26.544 --> 16:27.919
Thank you,
honey.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.878
- Thank you.
- So, what did you
wanna talk about?

16:33.878 --> 16:37.586
Oh, just I'm free
on Friday night now

16:37.586 --> 16:40.378
and wanted to see
if you wanted to do
something together.

16:40.378 --> 16:42.420
Pick me up at work?
I'll be done around 8:00.

16:42.420 --> 16:43.919
Then we'll have
just one car.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.044
- Uh, yeah.
- Great!

16:46.044 --> 16:48.961
- Where do you work?
- Uh, I work at Neiman Marcus.

16:48.961 --> 16:50.919
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

16:50.919 --> 16:54.003
- Huh.
- I am a sales professional
on the men's floor.

16:54.003 --> 16:55.836
If you ever want any help,
let me know.

16:55.836 --> 16:57.170
Now that
you mention it,

16:57.170 --> 16:59.586
I could actually use
a couple of pairs of pants.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.128
Call me anytime.
Seriously, stop by.

17:01.128 --> 17:02.961
- I'm going to.
- Great, give him my number.

17:02.961 --> 17:04.544
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:04.544 --> 17:06.170
- Larry, it's great to see you.
- Good to see you again.

17:06.170 --> 17:07.544
- Vey good to see you, Larry.
- Always a pleasure.

17:07.544 --> 17:09.544
Do you want me to leave
any money for this?

17:09.544 --> 17:11.170
- Are you taking
care of it? Okay.
- It's all right.

17:11.170 --> 17:12.752
- It's all right.
- He's a good guy.

17:12.752 --> 17:15.211
- To us.
- Oh! What do you
wanna do on Friday?

17:15.211 --> 17:16.253
Anything you want,
honey.

17:18.253 --> 17:20.420
( phone chimes )

17:20.420 --> 17:22.211
Oh.

17:22.211 --> 17:24.544
You wanna go
to the Rams game
on Sunday with Rob?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.878
He's got
extra tickets.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.044
I'd love to go
to the Rams game
on Sunday.

17:28.044 --> 17:30.669
- Gotta take Susie
to the airport.
- ( scoffs )

17:30.669 --> 17:32.502
She's ridiculous!

17:32.502 --> 17:34.461
- All right,
I got an idea.
- What?

17:36.086 --> 17:38.295
Accidental text
on purpose.

17:38.295 --> 17:39.961
Please explain.

17:39.961 --> 17:42.128
You're sending
a text to me,

17:42.128 --> 17:44.627
but it goes to her
"by accident."

17:44.627 --> 17:46.794
- Uh-huh.
- And in the text,
you say,

17:46.794 --> 17:49.086
"Hey, LD, I'd love
to go to the game,

17:49.086 --> 17:50.502
but I'm taking Susie
to the airport.

17:50.502 --> 17:51.878
I don't wanna
disappoint her.

17:51.878 --> 17:53.128
We're getting along
so great."

17:53.128 --> 17:55.211
- And it goes to her...
- It goes to her.

17:55.211 --> 17:56.836
- ...but it was meant to you.
- Meant to me!

17:56.836 --> 17:58.794
- Saying how great Susie is...
- How great Susie is.

17:58.794 --> 18:00.420
- ...and how much
I love her.
- Yeah.

18:00.420 --> 18:03.170
You, sir,
are an amazing man.

18:03.170 --> 18:05.170
- I am texting Susie right now.
- Oh, here they are.

18:05.170 --> 18:06.669
- Larry, Jeff.
- Hello.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.295
- Thanks for letting me
join you guys.
- Sure.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.836
- Yeah.
- You should see
this guy on the range.

18:10.836 --> 18:13.086
- What's your handicap?
- 10.

18:13.086 --> 18:15.003
- What are you?
- 15.

18:15.003 --> 18:17.961
We should
make it interesting,
play for some cheddar.

18:17.961 --> 18:20.461
- Sure.
- Yeah? 200?

18:20.461 --> 18:22.669
- Okay, you're on.
- Great.

18:25.378 --> 18:27.044
I pick up a knife,
I have an urge to stab.

18:27.044 --> 18:30.086
But it's a stupid thing
to say at a dinner table.

18:30.086 --> 18:33.544
And then you made
such a deal over
the goddamn filter.

18:33.544 --> 18:35.878
- Terrible water.
- But you didn't have
to say anything about it.

18:35.878 --> 18:38.502
How could you not comment
on water that's so bad?

18:38.502 --> 18:41.086
Okay, I've done
everything I can
to get her back.

18:41.086 --> 18:45.086
I sent her flowers-- boom--
shredded on my doorstep.

18:45.086 --> 18:47.711
I mean,
I don't know
what to do.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.878
- Oh!
- Oh!

18:50.878 --> 18:52.502
Both:
Oh!

18:52.502 --> 18:56.003
- Accidental text on purpose!
- Accidental text.
Oh, my God.

18:56.003 --> 18:58.336
- Tell him.
- Okay, here's what you do.

18:58.336 --> 19:00.128
You send me a text,

19:00.128 --> 19:04.420
but you accidentally
send it to her on purpose.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.211
And in the text,
you say something like,

19:06.211 --> 19:08.544
"Hey, Larry,
you were an asshole
the other night.

19:08.544 --> 19:11.502
There's nothing
wrong with her water.
It's perfectly okay."

19:11.502 --> 19:14.086
Say anything you want.
Curse me, anything.
I don't care.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.378
Okay, I've never
said this to you before.

19:16.378 --> 19:18.003
- Yeah.
- You're brilliant.

19:18.003 --> 19:19.711
- Thank you, thank you.
- Right, right?!

19:19.711 --> 19:21.711
I invented this.
I invented this.

19:21.711 --> 19:22.836
Jeff:
He already
did it for me.

19:22.836 --> 19:24.295
"Dear Larry..."

19:24.295 --> 19:26.544
- I can say
anything I want!
- Anything!

19:26.544 --> 19:28.253
"Larry, you were
so out of line

19:28.253 --> 19:30.128
the other night about
the water."

19:30.128 --> 19:31.919
- Yes!
- "If Marilyn didn't
throw you out, I would've."

19:31.919 --> 19:33.461
- Marty: Perfect!
- ( text whooshes )

19:33.461 --> 19:35.086
Damn it!

19:35.086 --> 19:36.420
He's had
some bad luck today.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.627
Jeff:
All right,
there we go.

19:40.627 --> 19:42.128
- Larry: Oh, that's nice.
- Marty: Here it comes.

19:42.128 --> 19:44.253
- Jeff: All right.
- Hey, where do you lie?

19:44.253 --> 19:45.586
Uh, four.

19:45.586 --> 19:46.752
- ( phone chimes )
- Marty: Look!

19:46.752 --> 19:48.627
She texted me
right back.

19:48.627 --> 19:50.170
"I love you.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.170
I know this is
not meant for me.

19:52.170 --> 19:55.752
What a great man
to stick up for me
like that."

19:57.170 --> 19:58.420
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

19:58.420 --> 19:59.669
- Unbelievable.
- Huh?

19:59.669 --> 20:01.586
- Brilliant!
- Get the flag, Jeff?

20:01.586 --> 20:02.919
Yep.

20:02.919 --> 20:04.420
Well, you're
playing great today.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.878
No, I'm having
a bad day.

20:07.752 --> 20:08.752
Beautiful.

20:08.752 --> 20:10.586
- Oh!
- Beautiful!

20:10.586 --> 20:11.711
Oh!

20:11.711 --> 20:13.253
- Is that a birdie?
- Beautiful.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.794
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, guys, I hate to do this.

20:15.794 --> 20:17.794
I got a medical emergency.
I gotta get to Cedars.

20:17.794 --> 20:20.961
- We only have three more holes.
- No, we got a medical
emergency here.

20:20.961 --> 20:22.420
Wait, wait.
What are you talking about?

20:22.420 --> 20:23.836
You owe me $200.
Pay up.

20:23.836 --> 20:25.627
It's an emergency.
I'm a doctor.

20:25.627 --> 20:27.128
You weren't a doctor
on the plane.

20:27.128 --> 20:28.836
I gotta go.
A patient needs me.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.794
Oh, boy,
you're down three
with three to play.

20:31.794 --> 20:35.794
Oh, so when you're losing money,
you heed the call, is that it?

20:35.794 --> 20:37.128
You know what that is?

20:37.128 --> 20:39.295
Selective heeding,
that's what that is!

20:39.295 --> 20:41.044
You didn't get
any text anyway.

20:41.044 --> 20:42.170
It was all bullshit!

20:49.711 --> 20:51.378
- Enigma?
- What the fuck?!

20:51.378 --> 20:53.544
- Whoa! Oh!
- ( thuds )

20:53.544 --> 20:55.128
- Jesus Christ!
- God!

20:55.128 --> 20:57.170
- Crazy!
- ( huffs )

20:57.170 --> 21:00.086
It's just perfume.

21:00.086 --> 21:03.378
...out of nowhere,
right in my face,
spritzing me.

21:03.378 --> 21:05.711
- They're the worst.
- Come on, what is that?
What a violation.

21:05.711 --> 21:07.336
You know what,
they'll usually
go away, though,

21:07.336 --> 21:08.502
if you just
wave them away.

21:08.502 --> 21:11.794
- Did you wave her away?
- Sort of, yeah.

21:11.794 --> 21:13.836
Here, do you like
this color?

21:13.836 --> 21:15.711
- Yeah, yeah,
that's good.
- Yeah.

21:15.711 --> 21:17.669
- All right,
let's try these.
- Okay.

21:17.669 --> 21:19.752
By the way, I wanted
to let you know

21:19.752 --> 21:23.211
I was very impressed
that you said something
about the water the other day.

21:23.211 --> 21:25.295
Well, thank you
for saying so.

21:25.295 --> 21:27.170
It's hard to, you know,
get in front of a group

21:27.170 --> 21:30.003
and-- and say
what everyone's thinking
when it's uncomfortable.

21:30.003 --> 21:31.961
You know,
I had no problem.

21:31.961 --> 21:34.669
Now, I got you
32 and 30.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.878
- Okay.
- What do you
wanna start with?

21:36.878 --> 21:38.878
- Eh, 32.
- All right.

21:38.878 --> 21:41.544
- Here's the 32.
- These look very nice, yeah.

21:41.544 --> 21:43.420
All right.

21:43.420 --> 21:44.919
Oh, okay.

21:51.752 --> 21:54.044
( music playing )

22:14.919 --> 22:16.711
Leon:
Yeah, he's
in the kitchen.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.586
- Look who's here.
- Hey.

22:20.086 --> 22:21.919
Oh, for God's sake.

22:21.919 --> 22:23.253
Look at this.

22:23.253 --> 22:25.253
My lace just broke.

22:25.253 --> 22:28.586
You-- and you know what,
there's no extra laces
in the house.

22:28.586 --> 22:30.544
Do you have extra laces
in your house?

22:30.544 --> 22:32.128
No, nobody does.

22:32.128 --> 22:33.961
I don't know why people
don't stock up on them.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.794
- They stock up
on canned food.
- Hey, we got a problem.

22:35.794 --> 22:40.128
Marilyn told me
she saw you in Neiman Marcus

22:40.128 --> 22:42.961
- push the spritz girl.
- Of course I did.

22:42.961 --> 22:44.794
What do you mean
of course you did?

22:44.794 --> 22:46.420
I got attacked
and I pushed.

22:46.420 --> 22:47.544
You don't push
a spritzer lady!

22:47.544 --> 22:49.211
You're out
of your fucking mind!

22:49.211 --> 22:50.669
It's a violation!
You don't just go up to people

22:50.669 --> 22:52.420
and spritz them
in the face like that.

22:52.420 --> 22:53.544
It's a violation.

22:53.544 --> 22:55.752
We have a very big
problem now.

22:55.752 --> 22:58.420
Marilyn is not
happy with you.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.128
You know what
I gotta do now?

23:00.128 --> 23:01.961
I gotta go through
and rewind--

23:01.961 --> 23:04.461
Let's hold on
to that thought
for a minute, okay?

23:04.461 --> 23:05.502
I think
I could fix this.

23:05.502 --> 23:07.044
Will you listen
to me, please?

23:07.044 --> 23:08.794
- You wet the end...
- I don't care about that.

23:08.794 --> 23:10.253
...and you just do this.

23:10.253 --> 23:11.836
Marilyn said to me

23:11.836 --> 23:13.461
I have to make
a choice.

23:13.461 --> 23:15.794
It's either Larry David
or Marilyn.

23:15.794 --> 23:17.003
She gave you
an ultimatum?

23:17.003 --> 23:19.461
An ultimatum.

23:19.461 --> 23:21.461
- Who'd you pick?
- I took Marilyn.

23:21.461 --> 23:23.295
I would've made
the same decision.

23:23.295 --> 23:25.211
Let's face it,
at this point in our lives,

23:25.211 --> 23:28.044
it's-- it's not so easy
to find people to
have sex with us.

23:28.044 --> 23:30.378
Leon:
Hey, vagina always wins.

23:30.378 --> 23:32.295
I lost a brother
to a vagina.

23:32.295 --> 23:34.794
He's quite a feminist,
isn't he?

23:34.794 --> 23:37.128
Vagina got his ass.

23:37.128 --> 23:38.752
Goodbye.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.961
So, if I run into you,
are you gonna talk to me

23:40.961 --> 23:43.253
or is this--
this is the last words
we're ever gonna exchange?

23:43.253 --> 23:45.336
I can't talk to you anymore.
I'm gonna miss you.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.336
So, when I see you
at the club dinner
tomorrow night,

23:47.336 --> 23:49.752
- no communication
there whatsoever?
- She said to me,

23:49.752 --> 23:52.086
"If you communicate
with him, I'm gone."

23:52.086 --> 23:56.128
Oh, hey, LD,
that Sophia Loren.
( kisses )

23:56.128 --> 23:57.669
- Whoo!
- You saw her movie?

23:57.669 --> 23:59.836
Mm-hmm.
"Marriage Italian Style."

23:59.836 --> 24:01.752
- Three times.
- I told you, right?

24:01.752 --> 24:03.919
- Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.
Fuckin' beautiful.

24:03.919 --> 24:06.336
Yeah. Oh, jeez.

24:06.336 --> 24:07.461
Ugh, my pants
are ready.

24:07.461 --> 24:08.961
Now I gotta go see
that Rhonda.

24:08.961 --> 24:11.336
- Something up
with that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

24:11.336 --> 24:13.502
This woman likes me.
Lewis's date.

24:13.502 --> 24:15.586
- How do you know?
- Well, she was quite taken

24:15.586 --> 24:17.836
with my water stance
the other night

24:17.836 --> 24:20.170
and she wouldn't get out
of the dressing room

24:20.170 --> 24:22.211
- when I--
when I was changing.
- She likes you.

24:22.211 --> 24:25.669
Yeah, and I gotta
go back there tomorrow
to pick up my pants.

24:25.669 --> 24:28.420
- You gonna hit it?
- No, I'm a loyal friend.

24:28.420 --> 24:30.211
When women give me
an ultimatum,

24:30.211 --> 24:33.544
"Who are you gonna choose,
me or your friend?"

24:33.544 --> 24:35.544
I say, "I'm gonna
choose my friend."

24:35.544 --> 24:37.669
- That's it.
- Why do you
have to do this?

24:37.669 --> 24:39.544
You dumped me.
You chose somebody over me.

24:39.544 --> 24:40.878
- I didn't dump anyone.
- Okay.

24:40.878 --> 24:42.878
I'm trying to say goodbye
and end this.

24:42.878 --> 24:44.170
Okay, goodbye.

24:44.170 --> 24:47.295
See ya.
See ya, Leon.

24:47.295 --> 24:49.752
- All right, get out.
- Don't keep talking.

24:49.752 --> 24:51.420
- You're standing there.
- I'm leaving.

24:51.420 --> 24:53.544
- Okay, well, go.
- Okay, I'm gonna leave.

24:53.544 --> 24:56.128
- I'm waiting.
- We're not playing last word.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.461
- No.
- One, two, three.

24:58.461 --> 24:59.711
- Bye.
- Bye.

24:59.711 --> 25:01.044
( sighs )

25:01.044 --> 25:03.295
- One, two, three.
- Both: Bye...

25:03.295 --> 25:05.627
- "Ay."
- No, don't do that.

25:05.627 --> 25:06.544
Both:
Goodbye.

25:07.752 --> 25:09.544
( clatters )

25:13.086 --> 25:14.461
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey.

25:14.461 --> 25:15.919
I got your pants.
You're all paid for.

25:15.919 --> 25:17.502
Oh, great, great.

25:17.502 --> 25:18.711
All right,
now we just try them on.

25:18.711 --> 25:21.044
- Come on.
- Oh, um,

25:21.044 --> 25:22.711
I-- I don't need
to try them on.

25:22.711 --> 25:24.878
- I can just, you know.
- Larry, you gotta try them on.

25:24.878 --> 25:26.544
They got shortened.
We gotta see if they're--

25:26.544 --> 25:28.461
That's not necessary.
I'll just take them.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.295
It's just gonna take a minute.
We'll be good.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.794
I actually
changed my mind about--
I didn't want the pants.

25:31.794 --> 25:33.461
These pants look
amazing on you.

25:33.461 --> 25:35.627
- Come on.
- It's not really necessary.

25:35.627 --> 25:38.420
- I don't need
to try on the pants--
- Larry, you're trying on pants.

25:39.544 --> 25:40.711
Right.

25:43.919 --> 25:45.919
I think these
lay great.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.461
- Do you like that break
on your sneaker?
- Yeah. Yeah.

25:48.461 --> 25:50.128
- ( phone chimes )
- I think that looks good.

25:50.128 --> 25:52.128
I think it's pretty--
oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

25:52.128 --> 25:55.086
We have a new tailor.
He does amazing work.

25:55.086 --> 25:58.461
( music playing )

25:58.461 --> 26:00.295
Rhonda:
I think that looks
pretty good.

26:01.461 --> 26:02.836
Yeah, yeah.

26:04.794 --> 26:06.378
And the hem
is right.

26:06.378 --> 26:07.794
I think
that looks good.

26:09.128 --> 26:10.502
( gasps )

26:12.295 --> 26:13.502
Oh, my God!

26:13.502 --> 26:14.627
- Oh!
- Larry!

26:14.627 --> 26:17.128
- Oh! Oh, I'm-- no!
- Oh!

26:17.128 --> 26:18.794
( stammering )
No! That's not from you.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.627
That-- that's from
Sophia Loren.

26:20.627 --> 26:22.586
Why was it in my face?

26:22.586 --> 26:25.211
Because it was an accident!
It was an accidental erection.

26:25.211 --> 26:26.544
- What?
- It was an accident.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.544
No, an accident
is tripping on a step,

26:28.544 --> 26:30.794
and then also
the Titanic going down.

26:30.794 --> 26:34.544
Yeah, but just the way
the Titanic went down,
this thing went up.

26:34.544 --> 26:37.669
It's the same--
it's the same thing.
They're both accidents.

26:37.669 --> 26:40.086
So, you're saying your penis
is like the Titanic?

26:40.086 --> 26:42.752
In a manner of speaking, yes.
I think they're-- they're
comparable.

26:42.752 --> 26:45.170
This is-- this is
really unprofessional.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.253
- I'm very
uncomfortable right now.
- Oh, this is unprofessional?

26:47.253 --> 26:49.336
You think I'm comfortable
when you're standing in
the dressing room

26:49.336 --> 26:50.669
when I'm changing
my pants?

26:50.669 --> 26:52.544
It's called
a concierge service.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.378
I've never heard of that
before in my life.

26:54.378 --> 26:56.378
I'd like you
to leave, Larry.

26:56.378 --> 26:57.420
- I'll go, yeah.
- Yeah.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.170
Okay. May--
may I have my pants?

26:59.170 --> 27:00.170
Here.

27:02.502 --> 27:06.378
You know, I gotta say,
the waist is a little big.

27:06.378 --> 27:07.836
Get out.

27:07.836 --> 27:10.836
I'll wear them with a belt.
I'll put a belt on.

27:10.836 --> 27:13.378
- ( TV playing )
- What's the score?

27:13.378 --> 27:14.961
14-7.

27:14.961 --> 27:16.003
( phone chimes )

27:18.461 --> 27:21.961
( scoffs )
This Dr. Winocur
I was telling you about?

27:21.961 --> 27:23.502
So, get a load of this.

27:23.502 --> 27:25.878
"Hi, Mrs. Downing,
it's Dr. Winocur.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.295
Even though I had to cut
my round of golf short,

27:28.295 --> 27:30.211
I'm glad I saw you
the other day.

27:30.211 --> 27:33.211
Be sure to take
all the medicine
as I prescribed it."

27:33.211 --> 27:37.211
- Another accidental...
- Both: Text on purpose.

27:37.211 --> 27:38.836
- Wow. Unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

27:38.836 --> 27:40.128
This is some doctor.

27:40.128 --> 27:41.919
They should take
this guy's license away.

27:41.919 --> 27:43.878
He was on a plane,
there was an emergency,
he didn't help out.

27:43.878 --> 27:47.170
Person fucking choking,
having pains in their chest,
you get the fuck up.

27:47.170 --> 27:49.878
- You've sworn
to a Hippocratic Oath.
- Sworn to it. Get the fuck up.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.752
Unless they got diarrhea
or some shit like that.

27:51.752 --> 27:55.003
If they announced that,
"Hey, we've got a passenger
who has diarrhea

27:55.003 --> 27:57.086
and it's uncontrollable
and it's all over
the fucking place,"

27:57.086 --> 28:00.378
I can see the person
sitting there and,
"Actually, fuck that.

28:00.378 --> 28:02.211
I don't feel like dealing
with diarrhea right now."

28:02.211 --> 28:04.461
( music playing )

28:20.878 --> 28:22.878
Marty:
I think you're gonna
have a good time.

28:22.878 --> 28:24.586
Marilyn:
I hope so.
( laughs )

28:24.586 --> 28:26.420
Marty:
I like that outfit you wore.
I really do.

28:26.420 --> 28:27.295
There's Larry.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.295
Just go inside. Ignore him.
Do not give him attention.

28:35.295 --> 28:38.961
Ignore him?
That's a 14-foot-long cock.

28:38.961 --> 28:40.919
( piano music playing )

28:43.086 --> 28:45.003
- Richard: Hey, pervert.
- Hey.

28:45.003 --> 28:48.919
So you get an erection
in the dressing room
with Rhonda.

28:48.919 --> 28:52.502
- How lovely.
- No, Leon sent me a video
of an old Sophia Loren movie

28:52.502 --> 28:54.128
from the '60s,
and that's what caused it.

28:54.128 --> 28:55.461
Rhonda had nothing
to do with it.

28:55.461 --> 28:57.211
- Leon sent you a movie--
- Yes, yeah.

28:57.211 --> 28:58.711
You know how
these things happen.

28:58.711 --> 29:01.044
- They-- they just occur.
- Oh, they just occur?

29:01.044 --> 29:05.128
Just like you drew a giant cock
on the side of your car.

29:05.128 --> 29:06.794
He drew a penis
on my car?

29:06.794 --> 29:07.961
- Fuckin' A...
- My God!

29:07.961 --> 29:09.461
...it's 12 feet long.

29:09.461 --> 29:11.420
- This guy's unbelievable.
- Who? What guy?

29:11.420 --> 29:13.128
I don't know.
I'm having a fight
with this guy.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.170
He's drawing stuff
on my car, messages.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.961
He's telling me
to wash it, and--

29:16.961 --> 29:19.003
Oh, I don't know what
you're fucking talking about.

29:19.003 --> 29:21.502
- Now he drew a penis--
- What, did you co-write
"Alice in Wonderland"?

29:21.502 --> 29:23.586
- You're a fucking nutcase.
- Oh, you think I'm making
that up?

29:23.586 --> 29:25.627
You think I go around
drawing penises on my car?

29:25.627 --> 29:28.878
- I'd have to be in Bellevue.
- She gave me an ultimatum.

29:28.878 --> 29:30.794
It's either you
or her.

29:30.794 --> 29:32.502
Funkhouser's girlfriend
did the same thing.

29:32.502 --> 29:34.711
I know. Everybody
has heard about it,
believe me.

29:34.711 --> 29:36.586
Who'd you choose?

29:36.586 --> 29:38.502
- I chose her.
- Huh.

29:38.502 --> 29:43.003
So, listen,
just stay away
from my girlfriend.

29:43.003 --> 29:44.128
Girlfriend?

29:44.128 --> 29:46.211
Oh, dear.
Premature girlfriend.

29:46.211 --> 29:48.253
- Oh, no,
I know-- no, no, no.
- Listen, Richard,

29:48.253 --> 29:50.211
you know what,
I think we're just looking
for other things right now.

29:50.211 --> 29:53.128
I call everybody girlfriend.
It's a thing of mine.

29:53.128 --> 29:55.878
Hi, girlfriend.
Girlfriend, hi.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.295
Honey!
Honey, come on.

29:58.295 --> 30:00.044
- Please, come on.
- Oh, this is nice.

30:00.044 --> 30:02.086
Oh, well, well.

30:02.086 --> 30:03.502
- Look who's here.
- Nathan: Hey, Larry.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.086
- You remember Bebe.
- Hi.

30:05.086 --> 30:08.086
- Oh, my, hi.
Who could forget Bebe?
- Good to see you.

30:08.086 --> 30:09.752
We hit it off
at baggage claim.

30:09.752 --> 30:11.627
You hit it off
at baggage claim.

30:11.627 --> 30:13.711
- What a beautiful story.
- Nathan: Yeah.

30:13.711 --> 30:17.378
By the way, I got that,
uh, "accidental text"
you sent me.

30:17.378 --> 30:18.669
I didn't
send you a text.

30:18.669 --> 30:20.502
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think you know you did.

30:20.502 --> 30:22.919
- Oh, I sent one
to Laura Downing.
- Oh, yeah.

30:22.919 --> 30:24.878
- Larry David.
- David. The Ds.

30:24.878 --> 30:27.420
- Yeah, yeah.
- They're very close, they...

30:27.420 --> 30:30.128
Yeah, it was
an accident, Larry.
Trust me, please.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.044
- And, Bebe...
- Mm-hmm.

30:32.044 --> 30:35.669
I would be remiss
if I didn't inquire
about your condition.

30:35.669 --> 30:37.544
You know, every day
is a struggle.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.461
- Mmm.
- But today, I'm doing good,
thank you.

30:40.461 --> 30:41.586
Good to hear.

30:43.003 --> 30:45.586
Are you sure that was
an accidental text?

30:45.586 --> 30:47.128
Yeah, I'm sure.

30:49.003 --> 30:51.586
Are you sure you have
a bladder condition?

30:51.586 --> 30:53.544
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- ( scoffs )

30:55.128 --> 30:57.086
( music playing )

31:08.794 --> 31:10.128
Okay.

31:11.794 --> 31:13.752
- Come on, Bebe.
- Yeah.

31:13.752 --> 31:15.711
- ( glass clinking )
- Man: Welcome, everyone.

31:15.711 --> 31:17.586
Thank you for
coming to celebrate

31:17.586 --> 31:19.919
Tip McDougal's
25 years on the links.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.627
- ( applause )
- We're gonna start
in just a couple minutes,

31:21.627 --> 31:23.627
so, uh, you know,
have a drink,

31:23.627 --> 31:25.128
relax, make yourself
comfortable.

31:25.128 --> 31:26.794
We'll be back
in just a couple.

31:26.794 --> 31:28.211
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey!

31:28.211 --> 31:30.128
So, what the fuck
with the penis on your car?

31:30.128 --> 31:32.295
I don't know.
I think somebody
on my block drew it.

31:32.295 --> 31:33.627
- Jeff: Oh, really?
- Yeah.

31:33.627 --> 31:35.128
- That is so inappropriate.
- Oh, God.

31:35.128 --> 31:36.295
Susie:
Hi, Richie.

31:36.295 --> 31:37.544
- Hey.
- How you doing?

31:37.544 --> 31:40.295
- Where's Rhonda?
- She left.

31:40.295 --> 31:43.044
Huh. You did
the premature girlfriend.

31:43.044 --> 31:44.378
You can't say
"girlfriend"

31:44.378 --> 31:48.170
until you've
dated somebody
12, 15 times.

31:48.170 --> 31:50.836
Yeah. Marilyn, am I right?
It's gotta be...

31:50.836 --> 31:53.669
Yeah, yeah. Ah.

31:53.669 --> 31:56.961
Hey, Funk Man, would you, uh--
would you mind passing
the bread this way?

31:59.211 --> 32:01.253
Would you mind asking Marty
to pass the bread?

32:01.253 --> 32:03.669
Marty, please
pass me the bread.
I'm famished.

32:03.669 --> 32:05.170
Marilyn,
just for tonight,

32:05.170 --> 32:07.003
would-- could you
give him an exemption

32:07.003 --> 32:09.752
from the no-talking rule
that you've imposed?

32:09.752 --> 32:12.586
- No.
- Just for tonight
so we can all have some fun.

32:12.586 --> 32:13.669
- No.
- We're at
the same table--

32:13.669 --> 32:15.336
Exemption denied.

32:16.961 --> 32:18.295
Okay.

32:20.502 --> 32:22.253
Hey, this
is fun, huh?

32:22.253 --> 32:23.752
I'm having
the time of my life.

32:23.752 --> 32:25.253
( muffled )
This is really a blast.

32:25.253 --> 32:26.836
Too bad we're gonna
have to leave early.

32:26.836 --> 32:28.752
I gotta pack.
San Francisco.

32:28.752 --> 32:31.544
And Jeff's driving me
to the airport, you know.

32:31.544 --> 32:35.752
- ( sighs )
- Think I was gonna buy
that bullshit accidental text?

32:35.752 --> 32:38.253
( mocking )
"Oh, I love my wife so much

32:38.253 --> 32:40.170
and-- and I'll miss
the football game."

32:40.170 --> 32:43.669
You think I bought that
"accidental text on purpose"?

32:43.669 --> 32:46.794
What-- what is
an accidental text
on purpose?

32:46.794 --> 32:48.378
You send
somebody a text,

32:48.378 --> 32:50.711
pretending it to be
to somebody else

32:50.711 --> 32:54.044
so they think they're
reading a private text.

32:54.044 --> 32:55.378
But, really,
what they're trying to do

32:55.378 --> 32:57.044
is give you
the information

32:57.044 --> 32:58.836
that they want to
manipulate you with.

32:58.836 --> 33:00.711
- It's bullshit.
- Huh.

33:02.961 --> 33:06.878
Did you send me
an accidental text
on purpose?

33:06.878 --> 33:08.378
Oh...

33:08.378 --> 33:11.544
You did.
That was a bullshit text.

33:11.544 --> 33:13.044
Marty:
I-- I don't
remember that.

33:13.044 --> 33:14.794
Do you like
my water?

33:14.794 --> 33:17.586
I-- you know,
I really don't--
I don't remember doing that.

33:17.586 --> 33:19.752
Do you like my water?

33:23.627 --> 33:26.878
I can't stand
your water.

33:26.878 --> 33:29.669
I can't--
I don't even know
what to say.

33:29.669 --> 33:33.170
It's like I took a straw
and put it in a frog's ass.

33:33.170 --> 33:34.752
It makes me sick!

33:34.752 --> 33:36.961
I wanna barf
every time I get near it.

33:36.961 --> 33:40.420
I can't stand the smell,
I can't stand the color,

33:40.420 --> 33:42.961
and I cannot
stand the taste.

33:42.961 --> 33:45.253
I can't take it
anymore!

33:46.669 --> 33:49.420
You know what,
talk to him all you want.

33:51.836 --> 33:53.794
Wow, you're the only guy
at this table

33:53.794 --> 33:55.295
that could hold on
to a woman.

33:55.295 --> 33:57.170
- ( glass clinking )
- ( chuckles )

33:57.170 --> 34:00.669
- ( applause )
- Thank you, everyone,
for coming tonight

34:00.669 --> 34:04.128
to honor Tip McDougal
and his lovely wife, Nancy.

34:04.128 --> 34:08.128
( chuckles )
We're losing a beloved member
of the Ocean View family.

34:08.128 --> 34:11.461
- All: Aw.
- Tip, we'll miss you.

34:11.461 --> 34:15.211
But in retirement,
maybe Tip will finally
be able to play some golf.

34:15.211 --> 34:18.420
- ( laughter )
- We had so many
great times with Tip

34:18.420 --> 34:20.836
and some rough ones, too.

34:20.836 --> 34:22.961
But he was mostly
on the fairway.

34:24.961 --> 34:27.752
I remember one time
on the 18th hole,
he had knocked...

34:27.752 --> 34:31.420
Larry, I hate
to even bother you with this,
but I'm on in two minutes.

34:31.420 --> 34:35.128
This guy just took my joke.
Can you help me out?

34:35.128 --> 34:37.420
What are you talking about?
This is a comedy emergency.

34:37.420 --> 34:40.420
- I'm off duty.
- Why won't you help me?

34:40.420 --> 34:42.502
You didn't heed
the call on the plane.

34:42.502 --> 34:44.253
You welched
on a $200 bet.

34:44.253 --> 34:46.295
You sent me
an accidental text
on purpose.

34:46.295 --> 34:48.794
I invented
the accidental text, okay?

34:48.794 --> 34:51.170
Yeah, go back to your table.
Get out. Go back.

34:53.669 --> 34:55.003
And, you...

34:55.003 --> 34:56.336
You've been
drinking water all night,

34:56.336 --> 34:57.752
haven't made one trip
to the bathroom.

34:57.752 --> 34:59.295
Not one trip.
I've been clocking you.

34:59.295 --> 35:01.878
Sir. Sir!
I have a condition.

35:01.878 --> 35:03.836
Yeah, you have
a condition, all right.

35:03.836 --> 35:06.336
You're a psychopath
who uses a weak bladder
to take advantage of people.

35:06.336 --> 35:09.461
But first,
the funniest doc
on the links,

35:09.461 --> 35:13.003
- Dr. Nathan Winocur.

35:14.295 --> 35:16.253
Man:
Come on up here.

35:16.253 --> 35:17.669
You're gonna love
this guy.

35:34.502 --> 35:35.420
Larry.

35:35.420 --> 35:38.295
Hey.
It's Dave.

35:38.295 --> 35:40.295
- Oh! Hey.
- Three houses down.

35:40.295 --> 35:41.878
- How are you?
- Yeah, yeah, good, good.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.627
It's really good
to see you here, Larry.

35:43.627 --> 35:45.086
Yeah, good--
good to see you.

35:45.086 --> 35:47.544
Yeah.
I love the car wash.

35:47.544 --> 35:49.502
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- Right?

35:49.502 --> 35:52.211
It's just endlessly
fascinating, you know?

35:52.211 --> 35:53.878
It comes down
on a conveyer,

35:53.878 --> 35:55.878
the brushes,
the water.

35:55.878 --> 35:57.669
- You feel like
you wanna go through it.
- That's right.

35:57.669 --> 35:59.253
- You know?
- That's exactly right.

35:59.253 --> 36:02.878
I look at a dirty car,
Larry, and I feel sorry
for it.

36:02.878 --> 36:05.044
It's almost like
it's screaming out,

36:05.044 --> 36:06.711
"Wash me!

36:08.044 --> 36:10.003
Wash me."

36:10.003 --> 36:12.086
- Good to see you, Larry.
- Yeah.

36:13.420 --> 36:16.878
( theme music playing )

37:39.878 --> 37:42.461
Namaste  means "the light within
me greets the light within you."

37:42.461 --> 37:44.794
There is no light within me.
That's the only problem there.
