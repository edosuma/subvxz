WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:02.736
&gt;&gt;<i> TRUE JACKSON, VP</i>

00:02.802 --> 00:03.570
WAS FILMED IN FRONT

00:03.636 --> 00:06.673
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.975
&gt;&gt; A PLEASANT GOOD MORNING.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.577
&gt;&gt; RYAN, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

00:10.643 --> 00:11.077
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.445
THEY'RE NOT FOR YOU.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.447
&gt;&gt; RYAN, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.648
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT FOR YOU, EITHER.

00:15.715 --> 00:16.950
THEY'RE FOR KELSEY.

00:17.016 --> 00:17.517
I FIGURE, NOW

00:17.584 --> 00:18.118
THAT WE'RE DATING--

00:18.184 --> 00:19.185
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT DATING.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.220
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.054
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS

00:21.121 --> 00:22.555
WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:22.622 --> 00:23.690
&gt;&gt; OH, RYAN, I DON'T WANT YOU

00:23.757 --> 00:24.524
TO PANIC OR ANYTHING,

00:24.591 --> 00:25.024
BUT I THINK

00:25.091 --> 00:26.459
THERE'S A BEE IN THOSE FLOWERS.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.193
&gt;&gt; YEAH, RIGHT,

00:27.260 --> 00:28.561
LIKE THERE'S REALLY A BEE IN--

00:28.628 --> 00:29.929
THERE'S A BEE IN THE FLOWERS!

00:29.996 --> 00:30.663
AAH!

00:30.730 --> 00:33.600
&gt;&gt; RYAN, RYAN, RYAN, RYAN.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.969
CALM DOWN!

00:36.035 --> 00:37.070
&gt;&gt; WELL, KELSEY'S NOT GONNA

00:37.137 --> 00:39.572
WANT THESE.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.875
HERE, I GOT THESE FOR YOU.

00:41.941 --> 00:42.809
&gt;&gt; HEY, RYAN, YOU SHOULD JOIN

00:42.876 --> 00:44.144
THE DRAMA CLUB.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.378
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD I WANNA DO THAT?

00:45.445 --> 00:46.246
&gt;&gt; KELSEY'S IN IT.

00:46.312 --> 00:46.913
&gt;&gt; SHE IS?

00:46.980 --> 00:48.481
WHAT IS IT? WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:48.548 --> 00:49.182
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU DO?

00:49.249 --> 00:50.717
IT'S A DRAMA CLUB.

00:50.784 --> 00:51.951
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST MEETING'S TOMORROW.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.987
I'M SO EXCITED TO DO COSTUMES.

00:54.053 --> 00:54.888
USUALLY, I HAVE TO SEW THEM

00:54.954 --> 00:55.822
ALL BY HAND.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.823
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.358
I'VE GOT A FACTORY ON HOLD.

00:58.425 --> 00:58.892
&gt;&gt; I HOPE WE PICK

00:58.958 --> 01:00.026
A ROMANTIC PLAY THIS YEAR,

01:00.093 --> 01:00.493
SO MIKEY J.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.628
CAN PLAY MY BOYFRIEND

01:01.694 --> 01:02.262
AND WE CAN HAVE A SCENE

01:02.328 --> 01:03.296
WHERE WE FINALLY,

01:03.363 --> 01:08.034
FINALLY KISS, AAH!

01:08.101 --> 01:09.636
SORRY, I'LL FIX THAT.

01:09.702 --> 01:10.503
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME

01:10.570 --> 01:11.571
YOU AND MIKEY J. KISSED.

01:11.638 --> 01:12.338
&gt;&gt; I LIED.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.006
&gt;&gt; THEN WHAT ABOUT THE DAY

01:13.072 --> 01:13.907
YOU WENT ON THAT ROMANTIC

01:13.973 --> 01:14.741
CARRIAGE RIDE?

01:14.808 --> 01:15.508
&gt;&gt; DIDN'T HAPPEN, MADE IT UP.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.075
&gt;&gt; AND THE TIME YOU

01:16.142 --> 01:16.843
WENT TO THE TOP

01:16.910 --> 01:17.744
OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

01:17.811 --> 01:18.378
AND WATCHED THE SUNSET?

01:18.445 --> 01:19.179
&gt;&gt; SAW IT IN A MOVIE.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.880
I THINK IT WAS HILARY DUFF.

01:20.947 --> 01:21.748
&gt;&gt; WAIT, I DON'T WANT

01:21.815 --> 01:24.083
KELSEY KISSING ANYONE.

01:24.150 --> 01:24.751
MAYBE, I'D BETTER JOIN

01:24.818 --> 01:25.852
THIS LITTLE CLUB

01:25.919 --> 01:26.619
AND KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

01:26.686 --> 01:27.454
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU HELP TRUE

01:27.520 --> 01:28.588
WITH COSTUMES?

01:28.655 --> 01:29.322
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

01:29.389 --> 01:30.457
LIKE I WANNA SPEND MY DAYS

01:30.523 --> 01:31.224
BEING AROUND PEOPLE

01:31.291 --> 01:32.892
MAKING CLOTHES.

01:32.959 --> 01:33.493
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK

01:33.560 --> 01:35.295
MAD STYLE IS?

01:35.361 --> 01:37.564
&gt;&gt; IT'S A MAGAZINE, RIGHT?

01:37.630 --> 01:38.064
&gt;&gt; IT'S OKAY,

01:38.131 --> 01:39.132
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP ANYWAY.

01:39.199 --> 01:39.766
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING

01:39.833 --> 01:41.301
COMPLETELY UNDER CONTROL.

01:41.367 --> 01:44.270
&gt;&gt; TRUE!

01:44.337 --> 01:45.772
HAVE YOU SEEN THE MUFFIN GUY?

01:45.839 --> 01:46.840
&gt;&gt; NO.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.641
AND WHY DID YOU CALL MY NAME?

01:48.708 --> 01:49.275
&gt;&gt; SORRY, I JUST REALLY

01:49.342 --> 01:51.911
WANT A MUFFIN.

01:51.978 --> 01:52.712
DID SOMEONE PUNCH A HOLE

01:52.779 --> 01:53.379
IN THE WALL?

01:53.446 --> 01:54.547
&gt;&gt; IT WAS RYAN.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.417
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, WHAT?

01:57.484 --> 01:58.184
&gt;&gt; HEY, AMANDA, DO YOU WANNA

01:58.251 --> 01:59.419
COME SEE OUR SCHOOL PLAY?

01:59.486 --> 02:01.120
&gt;&gt; IS BENICIO DEL TORO IN IT?

02:01.187 --> 02:01.621
&gt;&gt; NO.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.622
&gt;&gt; THEN I'LL PASS.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.325
&gt;&gt; COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.092
&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS

02:06.159 --> 02:06.993
I HAVEN'T SET FOOT IN A THEATER

02:07.060 --> 02:08.461
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

02:08.528 --> 02:09.762
IT'S A PAINFUL STORY.

02:09.829 --> 02:10.663
&gt;&gt; OKAY, MAYBE NEXT TIME.

02:10.730 --> 02:11.998
&gt;&gt; I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD

02:12.065 --> 02:12.899
AND THE LEAD

02:12.966 --> 02:14.767
IN MY SCHOOL'S PRODUCTION.

02:14.834 --> 02:15.802
A LITTLE PLAY ENTITLED,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.770
<i>THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS.</i>

02:17.837 --> 02:20.974
I PORTRAYED "DAIRY."

02:21.040 --> 02:21.574
THE CURTAIN WENT UP

02:21.641 --> 02:23.309
AND THERE I STOOD,

02:23.376 --> 02:24.210
FROZEN IN PLACE,

02:24.277 --> 02:25.979
UNABLE TO SPEAK.

02:26.045 --> 02:26.646
FELT LIKE MINUTES

02:26.713 --> 02:27.280
WERE PASSING BY,

02:27.347 --> 02:28.314
BUT LATER, I WAS TOLD

02:28.381 --> 02:31.651
IT WAS CLOSER TO AN HOUR.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.586
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.387
BUT I SUPPOSE EVERYONE'S HAD

02:34.454 --> 02:35.922
AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT.

02:35.989 --> 02:36.589
&gt;&gt; NOT ME.

02:36.656 --> 02:37.056
&gt;&gt; ME NEITHER.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.124
&gt;&gt; NOT EVEN CLOSE.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.159
&gt;&gt; I SEE.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.928
UH, FIX THE WALL, YES?

02:41.995 --> 02:42.829
AND CLEAN UP THESE BUTTONS.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.032
SOMEONE COULD GET HURT.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.166
&gt;&gt; AH, I HATE HOW GROWNUPS

02:47.233 --> 02:47.967
ARE ALWAYS TELLING US

02:48.034 --> 02:49.002
TO BE CAREFUL.

02:49.068 --> 02:53.006
WHOA!

03:51.331 --> 03:51.731
WAS I SUPPOSED

03:51.798 --> 03:52.899

03:52.966 --> 03:54.000

03:54.067 --> 03:54.734
I'M NOT REALLY SURE

03:54.801 --> 03:55.268

&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY, MIKEY J.,

03:56.369 --> 03:57.604
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

03:57.670 --> 03:58.571
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS WAIT

03:58.638 --> 03:59.439
AND SEE WHAT PART I GET

03:59.505 --> 04:00.039
AND THEN SIGN UP

04:00.106 --> 04:00.640
FOR WHATEVER CHARACTER

04:00.707 --> 04:02.675
KISSES HER.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.409
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU PSYCHED TO FIND OUT

04:03.476 --> 04:04.210
WHAT PLAY WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR?

04:04.277 --> 04:04.644
&gt;&gt; TOTALLY.

04:04.711 --> 04:05.712
LAST YEAR MY WHOLE PART

04:05.778 --> 04:06.613
WAS STANDING IN THE BACKGROUND,

04:06.679 --> 04:11.884
PRETENDING I WAS TALKING.

04:11.951 --> 04:12.518
&gt;&gt; WELL, I CAN'T WAIT

04:12.585 --> 04:13.419

04:13.486 --> 04:15.188
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

04:15.254 --> 04:16.356

04:16.422 --> 04:18.958

04:36.275 --> 04:37.110
I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT DRAMA

04:37.176 --> 04:38.011
AS I KNOW ABOUT

04:38.077 --> 04:38.911
VARSITY FOOTBALL,

04:38.978 --> 04:39.712
WHICH I'M ALSO NOW

04:39.779 --> 04:41.114

GO LIONS.

&gt;&gt; WHAT PLAY ARE WE DOING

04:47.420 --> 04:47.987
THIS YEAR?

04:48.054 --> 04:48.921
CAN IT BE SOMETHING ROMANTIC?

04:48.988 --> 04:49.589
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO DO SOMETHING

04:49.656 --> 04:50.189
I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE

04:50.256 --> 04:51.124

04:51.190 --> 04:53.192
LIKE<i> GREAT EXPECTATIONS,</i>

04:58.831 --> 04:59.298
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS?

04:59.365 --> 05:00.400
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

05:00.466 --> 05:01.034
WE DECIDED ON ANYTHING.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.568
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WHAT PLAY ARE WE DOING?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.504

&gt;&gt; AND I'LL DO COSTUMES.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.638
&gt;&gt; NO, I WILL.

05:38.705 --> 05:39.005
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

05:39.072 --> 05:39.906
SINCE WHEN DO YOU KNOW

05:39.972 --> 05:41.040
ANYTHING ABOUT COSTUMES?

05:41.107 --> 05:41.741
&gt;&gt; I KNOW EVERYTHING

05:41.808 --> 05:42.608
ABOUT COSTUMES.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.043
I'M A TEEN FASHION DESIGNER.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.646
&gt;&gt; I'M A TEEN FASHION DESIGNER.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.413
&gt;&gt; THEN IT'S SETTLED,

05:47.480 --> 05:48.147
THE TWO OF YOU

05:48.214 --> 05:49.982
CAN DO COSTUMES TOGETHER.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.151
&gt;&gt; YOU SAID WHAT NOW?

05:52.218 --> 05:53.786
&gt;&gt; NOW WHO WANTS TO DIRECT IT?

05:53.853 --> 05:55.088
&gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GOING TO?

05:55.154 --> 05:56.355
&gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T HAVE TIME.

05:56.422 --> 05:56.823
DID I MENTION

05:56.889 --> 05:58.791
THAT I'M ALSO THE JANITOR NOW?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.660
&gt;&gt; I WILL DIRECT IT.

06:00.727 --> 06:03.896
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

06:03.963 --> 06:06.999
&gt;&gt; I WILL BE YOUR DIRECTOR.

06:07.066 --> 06:07.633
&gt;&gt; HEY, SPIELBERG,

06:07.700 --> 06:10.136
YOUR ZIPPER'S DOWN.

06:10.203 --> 06:18.644
MADE YOU LOOK.

06:18.711 --> 06:19.212
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK

06:19.278 --> 06:21.514
OF THIS DRESS FOR BONNIE?

06:21.581 --> 06:22.749
&gt;&gt; AH, IT'S PERFECT.

06:22.815 --> 06:23.249
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

06:23.316 --> 06:24.250
&gt;&gt; NO, IT LOOKS LIKE

06:24.317 --> 06:25.585
TWO WOLVES GOT INTO A TUG-OF-WAR

06:25.651 --> 06:26.953
WITH A POTATO SACK.

06:27.019 --> 06:28.888
&gt;&gt; LET ME SEE YOURS.

06:28.955 --> 06:29.756
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT

06:29.822 --> 06:31.424
A HUNDRED PERCENT DONE,

06:31.491 --> 06:32.992
BUT YOU GET THE GIST.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.560
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT, A TREE?

06:34.627 --> 06:36.529
A LOLLIPOP?

06:36.596 --> 06:38.331
&gt;&gt; IT'S BONNIE AND/OR CLYDE.

06:38.397 --> 06:41.067
I'M GONNA WIN AN OSCAR.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.235
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

06:42.301 --> 06:43.069
&gt;&gt; AM I BOTHERING YOU?

06:43.136 --> 06:43.736
&gt;&gt; YES.

06:43.803 --> 06:49.041
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I'M DOING IT.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.543
&gt;&gt; HELLO, ROBOT.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.145
&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S YOU.

06:52.211 --> 06:53.346
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND SINCE

06:53.412 --> 06:54.514
YOU'RE NOT MY BOSS ANYMORE,

06:54.580 --> 06:55.748
I DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE TO YOU.

06:55.815 --> 06:56.883
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE NEVER NICE TO ME.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.618
NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:58.684 --> 06:59.519
&gt;&gt; WORKING WITH TRUE ON COSTUMES

06:59.585 --> 07:01.254
FOR OUR SCHOOL PLAY.

07:01.320 --> 07:01.788
&gt;&gt; IF YOU GIVE ME

07:01.854 --> 07:02.555
YOUR CREDIT CARD FOR 20 MINUTES,

07:02.622 --> 07:03.356
I'LL GET YOU SOME TICKETS.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.024
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, NO.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.025
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

07:06.092 --> 07:06.692
SOMETHING TRAUMATIC

07:06.759 --> 07:07.727
HAPPENED TO ME THE LAST TIME

07:07.794 --> 07:09.328
I WAS IN A THEATER.

07:09.395 --> 07:10.563
&gt;&gt; LET ME GUESS,

07:10.630 --> 07:11.330
SOMEBODY COMPLAINED

07:11.397 --> 07:12.098
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE PAST

07:12.165 --> 07:14.267
YOUR GIANT METAL HEAD?

07:14.333 --> 07:16.369
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A COLD NIGHT,

07:16.435 --> 07:18.638
BUT THE AIR WAS STILL.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.039
AS I STOOD MOTIONLESS,

07:20.106 --> 07:21.174
I REMEMBER THINKING

07:21.240 --> 07:22.208
AT ANY MOMENT

07:22.275 --> 07:23.943
THE WORDS WOULD COME.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.912
BUT NONE DID.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.246
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

07:27.313 --> 07:30.950
&gt;&gt; BOO!

07:31.017 --> 07:31.784
&gt;&gt; SOMETIMES I STILL HEAR IT

07:31.851 --> 07:40.827
IN MY NIGHTMARES.

07:40.893 --> 07:41.661
&gt;&gt; I SUPPOSE YOU HEARD

07:41.727 --> 07:45.164
THE WHOLE STORY?

07:45.231 --> 07:47.333
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A COLD NIGHT,

07:47.400 --> 07:54.540
BUT THE AIR WAS STILL...

07:54.607 --> 07:56.542
&gt;&gt; WHOA, WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

07:56.609 --> 07:57.877
&gt;&gt; IT'S THIS INDIAN FOOD.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.512
IT'S A SEVEN ON A PEPPER METER.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.646
ANYTHING OVER FIVE IS NOT MEANT

08:00.713 --> 08:02.281
FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.283
&gt;&gt; YOU LIKE INDIAN FOOD?

08:04.350 --> 08:06.052
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT.

08:06.118 --> 08:06.619
BUT SINCE I BECAME

08:06.686 --> 08:07.620
A FAMOUS DIRECTOR,

08:07.687 --> 08:08.654
I DECIDED I'D START LIVING

08:08.721 --> 08:09.522
ON THE EDGE.

08:09.589 --> 08:10.756
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DIRECTING?

08:10.823 --> 08:11.457
&gt;&gt; SCHOOL PLAY.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.091
&gt;&gt; IF YOU NEED ANY HELP,

08:12.158 --> 08:12.859
LET ME KNOW.

08:12.925 --> 08:13.426
I'M PRETTY GOOD

08:13.492 --> 08:14.627
AT DESIGNING SETS.

08:14.694 --> 08:15.428
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

08:15.494 --> 08:16.429
YOU KNOW ABOUT SET DESIGN?

08:16.495 --> 08:17.129
&gt;&gt; YEAH,

08:17.196 --> 08:17.830
IT'S ONE OF MY PASSIONS,

08:17.897 --> 08:19.065
RIGHT AFTER MAIL, DRUMMING,

08:19.131 --> 08:19.932
STREET POETRY

08:19.999 --> 08:21.767
AND COMPETITIVE BARBECUING.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.135
&gt;&gt; COMPETITIVE BARBECUING?

08:23.202 --> 08:23.903
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE FASTEST GROWING

08:23.970 --> 08:24.937
TEAM SPORT IN AMERICA.

08:25.004 --> 08:25.738
MY TEAM'S CALLED

08:25.805 --> 08:27.974
"GRILL DADDY AND THE PIT CREW."

08:28.040 --> 08:29.008
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A SILLY NAME.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.911
&gt;&gt; TAKE IT BACK.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.013
&gt;&gt; I TAKE IT BACK.

08:34.080 --> 08:34.847
&gt;&gt; SO THAT STUFF'S

08:34.914 --> 08:36.048
PRETTY SPICY, HUH?

08:36.115 --> 08:37.049
&gt;&gt; NAH,I DON'T KNOW WHY

08:37.116 --> 08:37.850
IT'S A SEVEN

08:37.917 --> 08:38.751
ON THE PEPPER METER.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.554
IT'S MORE LIKE A FOUR.

08:41.621 --> 08:50.963
IT'S A SEVEN.

08:51.030 --> 08:51.931
&gt;&gt; AFTERNOON, MA'AM,

08:51.998 --> 08:53.799
WE'D LIKE TO MAKE A WITHDRAWAL.

08:53.866 --> 08:54.533
&gt;&gt; FOR HOW MUCH?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.301
&gt;&gt; ALL OF IT.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.702
THIS IS A HOLDUP.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.337
&gt;&gt; PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.405
&gt;&gt; WE WON'T HURT YOU,

08:59.472 --> 09:00.773
AS LONG AS YOU DO EXACTLY

09:00.840 --> 09:04.977
AS WE SAM.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.147
&gt;&gt; IT'S A TYPO, JUST KEEP GOING.

09:08.214 --> 09:08.814
&gt;&gt; ONE DAY YOU'LL TELL

09:08.881 --> 09:09.749
YOUR GRANDKIDS

09:09.815 --> 09:10.850
ABOUT THE HOT SUMMER AFTERNOON

09:10.917 --> 09:12.418
WHEN YOU WERE ROBBED

09:12.485 --> 09:14.820
BY... BONNIE AND CLYDE.

09:14.887 --> 09:15.688
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A GREAT SCENE, GUYS.

09:15.755 --> 09:16.555
THAT WAS PERFECT.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.890
I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.025
&gt;&gt; I WANNA PLAY BONNIE.

09:19.091 --> 09:19.425
&gt;&gt; DONE.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.159
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

09:20.226 --> 09:21.761
THAT'S MY PART.

09:21.827 --> 09:25.464
&gt;&gt; SIDEBAR.

09:25.531 --> 09:25.998
&gt;&gt; COME ON, LULU,

09:26.065 --> 09:27.233
HELP ME OUT HERE.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.134
I REALLY LIKE HER.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.002
&gt;&gt; BUT I WANNA PLAY BONNIE.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.504
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN PLAY THE BANK TELLER.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.238
IN MANY WAYS, SHE'S THE MOST

09:32.305 --> 09:33.205
IMPORTANT CHARACTER.

09:33.272 --> 09:33.773
&gt;&gt; YEAH,

09:33.839 --> 09:34.507
BUT SHE DOESN'T KISS CLYDE,

09:34.573 --> 09:35.841
BONNIE DOES.

09:35.908 --> 09:36.842
&gt;&gt; NOT ANYMORE.

09:36.909 --> 09:37.543
NOW CLYDE KISSES

09:37.610 --> 09:39.178
THE BANK TELLER.

09:39.245 --> 09:39.812
&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT, EVERYONE

09:39.879 --> 09:53.693
BACK TO WORK.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.061
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?

09:55.127 --> 09:56.729
IT'S A SUIT FOR CLYDE.

09:56.796 --> 09:57.663
&gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE PINK.

09:57.730 --> 09:58.864
&gt;&gt; PINK?

09:58.931 --> 09:59.699
THAT DOESN'T REALLY GO

09:59.765 --> 10:00.666
WITH THE ERA.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.802
&gt;&gt; YOUR FACE IS AN ERROR.

10:02.868 --> 10:03.502
&gt;&gt; LOOK, I KNOW

10:03.569 --> 10:04.103
YOU DON'T LIKE ME,

10:04.170 --> 10:05.204
BUT CAN WE JUST TRY TO GET ALONG

10:05.271 --> 10:07.139
UNTIL WE FINISH THE COSTUMES?

10:07.206 --> 10:07.740
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU THINK

10:07.807 --> 10:09.442
THAT I DON'T LIKE YOU?

10:09.508 --> 10:13.813
&gt;&gt; YOU LEFT THIS ON MY DESK.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.014
&gt;&gt; I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.349
THAT WASN'T FOR YOU.

10:16.415 --> 10:17.984
&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T?

10:18.050 --> 10:18.818
&gt;&gt; IF YOU MUST KNOW,

10:18.884 --> 10:20.753
I WROTE THAT TO MYSELF

10:20.820 --> 10:23.022
BECAUSE SOMETIMES

10:23.089 --> 10:23.856
I DON'T LIKE THE PERSON

10:23.923 --> 10:25.758
I SEE IN THE MIRROR.

10:25.825 --> 10:26.859
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

10:26.926 --> 10:31.697
&gt;&gt; NO, IT WAS FOR YOU.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.566
&gt;&gt; I WALKED RIGHT INTO THAT ONE.

10:33.632 --> 10:34.200
&gt;&gt; OKAY, LET'S START

10:34.266 --> 10:35.134
WITH THE BANK SCENE.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.938
AND ACTION!

10:39.005 --> 10:39.939
WHERE'S CLYDE?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.974
&gt;&gt; SORRY, I WAS IN THE RESTROOM.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.943
&gt;&gt; OKAY, LISTEN UP, GENIUS.

10:44.010 --> 10:44.944
YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE,

10:45.011 --> 10:45.811
THERE ARE A MILLION OTHER KIDS

10:45.878 --> 10:47.980
WHO WOULD KILL FOR YOUR SPOT.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.081
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE HERE.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.282
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM

10:50.349 --> 10:51.484
THAT WAY.

10:51.550 --> 10:55.488
NOW, GET IT TOGETHER!

10:55.554 --> 10:56.522
&gt;&gt; RYAN, I'VE GOT THE SETS

10:56.589 --> 10:57.556
FOR YOU TO CHECK OUT.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.792
&gt;&gt; AWESOME.

10:59.859 --> 11:00.960
&gt;&gt; WOW,

11:01.027 --> 11:03.562
IS THIS CLYDE'S SUITCASE?

11:03.629 --> 11:04.864
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S THE BANK SET.

11:04.930 --> 11:05.698
LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOWS.

11:05.765 --> 11:06.632
CHECK OUT THE DETAIL

11:06.699 --> 11:09.001
ON THE BANK MANAGER'S FEDORA.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.369
&gt;&gt; THIS IS REALLY SMALL.

11:10.436 --> 11:11.003
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.071
NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK

11:12.138 --> 11:12.772
ABOUT THE BANK VAULT?

11:12.838 --> 11:13.406
SHOULD I PUT THE HINGES

11:13.472 --> 11:14.907
ON THE OTHER SIDE?

11:14.974 --> 11:15.608
&gt;&gt; I'M KINDA GETTING

11:15.674 --> 11:16.642
A HEADACHE HERE, JIMMY.

11:16.709 --> 11:17.376
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT

11:17.443 --> 11:19.111
SO LITTLE?

11:19.178 --> 11:25.618
DANA, JUICE BOX!

11:25.684 --> 11:26.218
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK

11:26.285 --> 11:26.886
OF THE WOOD PANELING

11:26.952 --> 11:27.887
IN THE MANAGER'S OFFICE?

11:27.953 --> 11:28.587
&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S ALL GOOD.

11:28.654 --> 11:29.255
LOOK, I GOTTA GET BACK

11:29.321 --> 11:30.523
TO REHEARSING.

11:30.589 --> 11:31.590
&gt;&gt; LET ME GET THAT MODEL BACK.

11:31.657 --> 11:32.091
I'M GONNA PUT

11:32.158 --> 11:32.691
A COUPLE MORE PENCILS

11:32.758 --> 11:35.294
IN THE DESK DRAWER.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.062
&gt;&gt; OKAY, LET'S TAKE IT

11:36.128 --> 11:37.096
FROM WHERE WE WERE.

11:37.163 --> 11:41.300
AND ACTION! CUT!

11:41.367 --> 11:42.168
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED?

11:42.234 --> 11:43.035
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST OPENED THE DOOR

11:43.102 --> 11:43.869
WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND.

11:43.936 --> 11:44.670
THE BANK TELLER

11:44.737 --> 11:45.404
WAS LEFT-HANDED.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.006
&gt;&gt; SO?

11:47.073 --> 11:48.107
&gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE RUINING

11:48.174 --> 11:49.108
THE HISTORICAL ACCURACY

11:49.175 --> 11:50.509
OF THE PLAY.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.244
&gt;&gt; KELSEY'S DRINKING GRAPE SODA.

11:52.311 --> 11:53.112
&gt;&gt; SHE'S NOT GONNA BE DOING THAT

11:53.179 --> 11:54.280
DURING THE SCENE.

11:54.346 --> 11:54.980
&gt;&gt; I MIGHT.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.549
&gt;&gt; I LOVE IT, GREAT CHOICE.

11:56.615 --> 11:57.983
OKAY, PEOPLE, BACK TO ONE.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.452
&gt;&gt; THE BANK'S BORING.

11:59.518 --> 12:00.186
WHERE'S THE SCENE

12:00.252 --> 12:01.220
WHERE BONNIE TRIES ON CLOTHES

12:01.287 --> 12:02.021
AND DANCES?

12:02.088 --> 12:03.856
I WANT TO DANCE.

12:03.923 --> 12:04.623
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.357
ANY OTHER THOUGHTS

12:05.424 --> 12:06.826
ON THE SCRIPT?

12:06.892 --> 12:09.228
&gt;&gt; CLYDE SHOULD BE MY BUTLER.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.262
&gt;&gt; THAT IS EXACTLY

12:10.329 --> 12:12.098
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.733
&gt;&gt; SIDEBAR.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.267
&gt;&gt; HEY, GOOFBALL,

12:15.334 --> 12:15.968
WHERE'S THE SCENE

12:16.035 --> 12:16.936
WHERE I KISS CLYDE?

12:17.002 --> 12:18.604
&gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T WRITTEN IT YET.

12:18.671 --> 12:19.371
&gt;&gt; WRITE IT SOON.

12:19.438 --> 12:19.972
&gt;&gt; I WILL.

12:20.039 --> 12:28.514
&gt;&gt; YOU BETTER.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.648
&gt;&gt; RYAN, CAN WE SHOW YOU

12:29.715 --> 12:31.016
OUR IDEAS FOR THE COSTUMES?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.151
&gt;&gt; SURE.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.252
&gt;&gt; NOW, WE DIDN'T

12:33.319 --> 12:33.953
EXACTLY SEE EYE TO EYE,

12:34.019 --> 12:34.587
SO WE'RE EACH GOING

12:34.653 --> 12:35.721
TO PRESENT OUR OWN.

12:35.788 --> 12:36.622
&gt;&gt; I'LL GO FIRST

12:36.689 --> 12:37.590
BECAUSE TRUE'S DESIGNS

12:37.656 --> 12:38.524
WILL PROBABLY MAKE YOU THROW UP

12:38.591 --> 12:40.526
OUT OF YOUR EYES.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.861
I DESIGNED THIS FOR BONNIE.

12:41.927 --> 12:42.361
IT'S PINK,

12:42.428 --> 12:44.163
WHICH IS THE COLOR OF ROYALTY.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.431
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.065
&gt;&gt; I MODELED MINE

12:46.132 --> 12:46.966
AFTER AN ACTUAL DRESS

12:47.032 --> 12:48.501
BONNIE WORE IN A PHOTO I FOUND,

12:48.567 --> 12:50.169
BUT I PUT MY OWN TOUCHES ON IT,

12:50.236 --> 12:52.004
LIKE THE LACE ON THE SLEEVES.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.072
&gt;&gt; WOW, I MEAN,

12:53.139 --> 12:54.673
THEY'RE BOTH REALLY GOOD.

12:54.740 --> 12:55.541
HOWEVER, THE PINK ONE STINKS.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.842
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE FIRED.

12:56.909 --> 12:57.576
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

12:57.643 --> 12:58.244
&gt;&gt; COME ON, PINKY,

12:58.310 --> 12:59.378
HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF US

12:59.445 --> 13:01.413
AND I AM A PROFESSIONAL, UH-HUH.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.381
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU'RE FIRED, TOO.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.450
&gt;&gt; WHAT? KELSEY!

13:04.517 --> 13:13.659
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

13:13.726 --> 13:14.260
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN HE FIRE ME

13:14.326 --> 13:15.227
FROM WARDROBE?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.363
I DESIGN CLOTHES FOR A LIVING.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.264
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

13:18.330 --> 13:19.732
WE SHOULD GET REVENGE.

13:19.798 --> 13:20.533
&gt;&gt; LIKE HOW?

13:20.599 --> 13:21.400
&gt;&gt; RUIN THE PLAY.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.101
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANNA DO THAT

13:22.168 --> 13:22.535
TO RYAN.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.537
HE'S STILL A REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.638
&gt;&gt; TRUE, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET

13:25.704 --> 13:26.605
ANYWHERE IN THIS WORLD

13:26.672 --> 13:28.107
BEING SO NICE.

13:28.174 --> 13:28.741
&gt;&gt; I'M A 16-YEAR-OLD

13:28.807 --> 13:29.208
VICE PRESIDENT

13:29.275 --> 13:30.709

13:30.776 --> 13:31.477
&gt;&gt; WHO JUST GOT FIRED

13:31.544 --> 13:32.511
FROM A HIGH SCHOOL PLAY.

13:32.578 --> 13:33.746
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU MAD?

13:33.812 --> 13:35.247
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE.

13:35.314 --> 13:35.948
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE?

13:36.015 --> 13:36.849
&gt;&gt; OKAY, A LOT.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.651
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SPIR

13:38.717 --> 13:39.118
NOW LET'S GO

13:39.185 --> 13:40.352

13:42.888 --> 13:43.389
&gt;&gt; IT'S POSSIBLE

13:43.455 --> 13:48.994
YOU'RE ANGRIER THAN ME.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.095
HI, MISS PARK.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.297

13:51.363 --> 13:52.431

13:52.498 --> 13:53.999
&gt;&gt; OH, HI.

13:54.066 --> 13:57.603
&gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE IN REVENGE?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.438
WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT, RYAN?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.173
&gt;&gt; HE FIRED US FROM THE PLAY.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.875
&gt;&gt; OH, I'M SORRY, BUT I'VE GOT

14:02.942 --> 14:04.743
BIGGER FISH TO FRY, LITERALLY.

EVERYBODY, GET IN YOUR PLACES.

WHY IS MY MICROPHONE

15:25.124 --> 15:25.624
NOT WORKING?

15:25.691 --> 15:27.893
I'M GOING TO LOSE MY VOICE.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.998
VERY NICE.

15:33.065 --> 15:37.236
&gt;&gt; GO FOR IT.

15:37.303 --> 15:37.836

15:39.772 --> 15:52.718

15:52.785 --> 15:53.352
&gt;&gt; HEY, JIMMY.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.853
DO YOU MIND IF I SIT WITH YOU?

15:55.721 --> 15:56.922
I'D SEE YOU HERE.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.223
&gt;&gt; I'M EXCITED TO SEE YOUR SETS.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.858
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT MY SETS ANYMORE.

15:59.925 --> 16:00.959
KELSEY HAD RYAN FIRE ME

16:01.026 --> 16:01.593
BECAUSE I LAUGHED

16:01.660 --> 16:03.696

16:03.762 --> 16:04.897
&gt;&gt; HOW'D SHE PRONOUNCE IT?

16:04.963 --> 16:06.632
&gt;&gt; RA-HUB-DARD.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.333
SHE SAID IT LIKE 10 TIMES

16:07.399 --> 16:09.702
IN A ROW.

16:09.768 --> 16:10.269
&gt;&gt; MAN, THIS IS

16:10.336 --> 16:11.036
THE FIRST SCHOOL PLAY

16:11.103 --> 16:11.570

16:11.637 --> 16:12.304
THAT I WASN'T WORKING

16:12.371 --> 16:13.605

16:13.672 --> 16:14.506
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU'RE BUMMED,

16:14.573 --> 16:15.274
BUT THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT'S

16:20.179 --> 16:25.050
&gt;&gt; SCOOT OVER, STRETCH.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.630

16:38.697 --> 16:39.965
THIS MEANS LADY GAGA

16:51.210 --> 16:51.877

16:51.944 --> 16:54.380

WHEN I WAS BORN

17:25.911 --> 17:27.479
ON MARCH 24, 1909,

17:27.546 --> 17:28.514
THAT I'D GROW UP

17:28.580 --> 17:30.182
TO BE A GRASS ROOTS FOLK HERO?

17:30.249 --> 17:30.816
CERTAINLY, NOT

17:30.883 --> 17:31.784
ANY OF MY SIX BROTHERS

17:31.850 --> 17:33.652

17:59.812 --> 18:01.380

18:01.447 --> 18:02.981
I SURE HOPE THE DAY DOESN'T COME

18:03.048 --> 18:04.783
WHEN WE GET AMBUSHED IN A CAR.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.151
&gt;&gt; OH, CALM DOWN, CLYDE.

18:36.114 --> 18:37.449
THE PLAY'S NOT OVER?

18:37.516 --> 18:38.584

19:14.052 --> 19:15.287
'CAUSE WE'RE...

19:15.354 --> 19:17.923
BONNIE AND CLYDE.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.658
&gt;&gt; THIS THING IS A TRAIN WRECK.

19:19.725 --> 19:22.060
THEY SHOULD PUT IT ON NBC.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.428
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY DRESS.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.731
LULU'S WEARING MY DRESS.

19:25.797 --> 19:26.431
&gt;&gt; WELL, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT

19:26.498 --> 19:27.666
COVERED WITH SLIME AND CONFETTI

19:27.733 --> 19:28.300
BECAUSE THAT'S

19:28.367 --> 19:33.105
WHAT'S COMING NEXT.

19:33.171 --> 19:33.972
&gt;&gt; WE'LL HIDE THE GETAWAY CAR

19:34.039 --> 19:34.806
IN THE ALLEY.

19:34.873 --> 19:35.574
&gt;&gt; IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

19:35.641 --> 19:36.275
AND WE GET SEPARATED,

19:36.341 --> 19:38.210
MEET ME AT THE OLD MINTON FARM.

19:38.277 --> 19:39.177
&gt;&gt; NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.447
WE'RE... BONNIE AND CLYDE.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.684
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SO GOOD.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.753
&gt;&gt; TRUE, COME BACK HERE.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.087
&gt;&gt; TELEGRAM FOR BONNIE PARKER.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.389
&gt;&gt; I'M BONNIE PARKER.

19:50.455 --> 19:51.256
TRUE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:51.323 --> 19:52.424
&gt;&gt; IMPORTANT MESSAGE,

19:52.491 --> 19:53.625
URGENT, STOP.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.626
DON'T SIT ON THE CHAIR.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.494
STOP.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.229
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S A CHAIR STOP?

19:57.296 --> 19:57.863
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A PROBLEM

19:57.930 --> 19:58.363
WITH THE CHAIR.

19:58.430 --> 19:58.931
LET ME GET RID OF IT

19:58.997 --> 19:59.932
FOR YOU, MA'AM.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.133
&gt;&gt; EXTRY, EXTRY,

20:01.199 --> 20:03.268
DON'T MOVE THAT CHAIR.

20:03.335 --> 20:03.835
&gt;&gt; GET OUT OF HERE.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.070
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN THE PLAY.

20:05.137 --> 20:05.971
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE POINT, REMEMBER?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.039
YOU'RE ON THE DARK SIDE.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.240
&gt;&gt; I QUIT THE DARK SIDE.

20:08.307 --> 20:08.807
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

20:08.874 --> 20:09.675
&gt;&gt; YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

20:09.741 --> 20:10.375
&gt;&gt; YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

20:10.442 --> 20:11.043
&gt;&gt; UH-UH,

20:11.109 --> 20:15.480
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:15.547 --> 20:28.527
UH-OH.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.028
&gt;&gt; AND THEN BONNIE AND CLYDE

20:30.095 --> 20:30.996
DROVE OFF IN A CAR

20:31.063 --> 20:31.730
AND WERE KILLED.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.332
THE END.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.032
THANK YOU SO MUCH

20:34.099 --> 20:34.633

20:34.700 --> 20:35.667

20:42.874 --> 20:43.542
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.477
&gt;&gt; WHEN I STARTED THIS PROJECT,

20:45.544 --> 20:46.211
I WANTED TO PORTRAY

20:46.278 --> 20:48.347
BONNIE AND CLYDE WITH DIGNITY

20:48.413 --> 20:49.348
AND--THERE'S A BEE

20:49.414 --> 20:50.415
IN THE FLOWER!

20:50.482 --> 21:00.258
OOH, OOH.

21:00.325 --> 21:00.926
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SURE

21:00.993 --> 21:02.694

21:02.761 --> 21:04.630
&gt;&gt; YES, I'M SURE.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.164
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU CAN'T TELL.

21:06.231 --> 21:07.432
&gt;&gt; THANK GOODNESS, I'M TAKING

21:07.499 --> 21:08.767

21:08.834 --> 21:10.869

21:10.936 --> 21:11.536
THERE MIGHT BE

21:11.603 --> 21:12.237
A LITTLE SWELLING,

21:12.304 --> 21:12.804
BUT I DOUBT

21:12.871 --> 21:13.972
ANYONE'S GONNA NOTICE.

21:14.039 --> 21:14.606
&gt;&gt; WHOA! WHAT HAPPENED

21:14.673 --> 21:16.241
TO YOUR FACE?

21:16.308 --> 21:20.078
&gt;&gt; LULU, LET ME FIND A MIRROR.

21:20.145 --> 21:23.815
[A WOMAN SCREAMS]

21:23.882 --> 21:24.850
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH PINKY

21:24.916 --> 21:26.018
AND THE STICKY CHAIR?

21:26.084 --> 21:26.785
&gt;&gt; THE BAD NEWS IS

21:26.852 --> 21:27.886
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET IT OFF.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.887
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS

21:28.954 --> 21:29.688
SHE'LL ALWAYS HAVE

21:29.755 --> 21:31.089
SOMEWHERE TO SIT.

21:31.156 --> 21:31.790
&gt;&gt; I COULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE

21:31.857 --> 21:32.991
STUCK TO THAT CHAIR.

21:33.058 --> 21:33.959
THANKS FOR SAVING ME.

21:34.026 --> 21:34.526
&gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM.

21:34.593 --> 21:34.993
AND YOU KNOW,

21:35.060 --> 21:36.028

21:36.094 --> 21:36.962

21:37.029 --> 21:37.562
&gt;&gt; I'M PRETTY HAPPY

21:37.629 --> 21:38.930
WITH MY PERFORMANCE.

21:38.997 --> 21:39.998
I'M JUST BUMMED THE SHOW ENDED

21:40.065 --> 21:41.333

21:56.848 --> 21:57.382

22:05.223 --> 22:07.125
QUITE INSPIRATIONAL.

22:07.192 --> 22:07.826
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GREAT.

22:07.893 --> 22:08.393
&gt;&gt; I EVEN SPOKE

22:08.460 --> 22:09.594
TO A LOCAL COMMUNITY THEATER

22:09.661 --> 22:10.796
ABOUT MOUNTING A REVIVAL

22:10.862 --> 22:12.564
OF "THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS."

22:12.631 --> 22:13.398
I WOULD, OF COURSE,

22:13.465 --> 22:17.069
BE REPRISING MY ROLE AS "DAIRY."

22:17.135 --> 22:20.072
[APPLAUSE]

22:20.138 --> 22:22.207

22:26.511 --> 22:27.546
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO THAT.

22:27.612 --> 22:33.685
&gt;&gt; NO WAY.
