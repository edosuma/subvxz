00:57.307 --> 00:58.422
I canceled the last one.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.978
That's right.
Now move, move, move, move.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.970
It's my very special recipe.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.639
We're not gonna make it
if we don't hurry.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.603
You realize how late <i>we...</i>

01:09.945 --> 01:11.686
I told you,
you're gonna break those toys.

01:11.863 --> 01:12.944
Just stop.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.823
Oh, wow! Wait!
Santa Claus, come quick. Look.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.449
Incoming!

01:18.537 --> 01:20.198
Take cover!

01:29.172 --> 01:31.425
Let's get them!

01:34.261 --> 01:35.501
Come on over here!

01:36.054 --> 01:38.011
Hurry up! Hurry!

01:49.610 --> 01:51.192
It's Lee Majors!

01:51.695 --> 01:53.857
The Six Million Dollar Man.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.068
Santa, is there a back way
out of this place?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.231
Of course there is, Lee.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.026
But this is one Santa
that's going out the front door.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.160
Look, it don't matter a hill of beans
what happens to rne.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.992
The world couldn't afford it
if anything happened to you.

02:04.166 --> 02:04.997
Now you stay put.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.161
That's very nice of you, Lee.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.875
And, Lee, you've been
a real good boy this year.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.919
- Yes, you sure have.
- Yeah!

02:15.594 --> 02:18.962

You know
who loves Mary Lou Retton, Frank?

04:41.198 --> 04:42.438
My kids.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.900
- Yeah.
- Children love an acrobat.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.080
Oh, God.

04:52.584 --> 04:56.873
We have spent $40 million

with America's favorite old fart

05:01.259 --> 05:04.718
reading a book in front of a fireplace!

05:07.015 --> 05:10.383
Now I have to kill all of you.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.476
Mother, help me.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.649
Excuse me, sir.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.985
I don't wanna be
out of line here, but...

05:25.158 --> 05:28.321
Well, we've been running that spot now
for over a month and,

05:28.495 --> 05:30.907
well, it's getting a hell of a response.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.324
I am the youngest president

05:35.794 --> 05:38.912
in the history of television,
for a reason.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.375
I know the people.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.292
Well, granted,

05:45.470 --> 05:47.962
but the people already wanna
watch the show.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.508
That isn't good enough!

05:53.019 --> 05:56.011
They have gotta be
so scared to miss it!

05:56.189 --> 05:57.645
So terrified!

05:58.483 --> 06:01.942
Now, if I were in charge,

06:02.237 --> 06:03.602
and I <i>am...</i>

06:08.660 --> 06:10.367
Perhaps I can help you.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.950
Here's the kind of thing
I would have done. Grace, cue it up.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.467
<i>Acid rain.</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:33.549
<i>Drug addiction.</i>

<i>Now, more than ever,</i>

06:43.278 --> 06:46.191
it is important to remember
the true meaning of Christmas.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.323
<i>Don't miss Charles Dickens'
immortal classic, Scrooge.</i>

06:51.620 --> 06:55.158
<i>Your life might just depend on it.</i>

07:01.713 --> 07:02.874
Not bad, eh?

07:05.550 --> 07:08.042
I think they'll like it
in the heartlands.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.013
I want it every hour, on the hour.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.765
I'll take care of it, Frank.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.178
Get me Standards and Practices
in here. I want to see Reece.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.183
Excuse me, sir.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.604
Yes?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.731
Mr. Cross,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.857
what exactly does that ad
have to do with Scrooge?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.737
Nothing. Why?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.778
Well, you can't show that commercial.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.240
If you run that, you're gonna...

07:35.413 --> 07:36.869
You're gonna frighten people.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.371
You think I'm way off base here?

07:38.541 --> 07:41.579
Yes. Well, you're a tad off base, sir.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.792
<i>That</i> thing <i>looked</i> like
<i>The Manson Family Christmas Special.</i>

07:46.549 --> 07:48.756
Well, it's a little late
to get this kind of feedback.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.679
That's because this is the first time
I've ever seen it, sir.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.010
You're right. I sprung it on you.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.925
Well, it's not that bad, it's...

07:58.103 --> 07:59.389
Just lose, like,

07:59.562 --> 08:01.769
you know,
the part with the gun and the blood...

08:01.940 --> 08:04.557
- All right, all right.
- <i>...and</i> the guy shooting up, and the...

08:04.734 --> 08:07.112
If I can change it,
I'll let you know in five minutes.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.814
Well, thank you, sir.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.698
Thank you.

08:10.865 --> 08:14.233
You know, in a lot of ways,
I think we're a little bit alike.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.737
Sir, merry Christmas.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.831
- Thanks for the talk.
- Thank you.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.459
We don't wanna
scare the dickens out of people.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.084
Merry Christmas, Miss Cooley.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.496
The dickens out of people!

08:27.757 --> 08:29.168
Nobody gets me.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.546
Grace, who is that guy?

08:32.721 --> 08:34.928
- Eliot Loudermilk.
- OK.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.172
Call Security.
Have them change his locks,

08:37.350 --> 08:39.057
clean out his desk
and toss him out of the building.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.467
He's fired?

08:41.895 --> 08:43.602
But it's Christmas!

08:43.773 --> 08:44.934
Thank you.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.933
Call Accounting. Stop his bonus.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.441
- A clear shot at his back.
- Eliot Loudermilk.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.364
Code 9.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.529
Grace, what in the hell is this?

08:57.078 --> 08:59.695
Well, that's a painting
one of my kids did.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.456
There's Santa Claus,
and there's Mrs. Claus.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.162
Honey, how many fingers
does Mrs. Santa Claus have here?

09:05.336 --> 09:07.623
- Eleven.
- Eleven. Right.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.289
It's crap. Lose it.
I don't want it on the walls.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.832
She'll understand.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.468
She's an amazingly
understanding woman.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.968
I'll just come home and I'll say,

09:16.139 --> 09:19.427
"Hi, honey. We have to move
to a studio apartment.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.636
I hope you don't mind."

09:22.812 --> 09:25.190
Mr. Cross,
it's time for your Christmas list.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.939
OK, read me the list.
I wanna get this over with.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.645
Sammy Goldberg.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.393
Bath towel.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.694
Lou Parker.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.071
Send him a VHS home video recorder.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.948
Colonel Torn Parker.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.492
The bath towel.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.825
- Tamara Forristal.
- VHS.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.826
You know, there's a lot of virtues
in taking a bus to work, you know.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.999
Hi, fellas.
Thanks a lot and merry Christmas.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.631
- Bobby Lou Caluda.
- The bath towel.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.423
Eliot Loudermilk's leaving early today.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.758
Move. Get out of here.

09:58.932 --> 09:59.967
Done!

10:00.517 --> 10:02.474
Four minutes and 4O seconds.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.385
Glenn Glenn Whitacre?

10:05.188 --> 10:06.895
What was the last rating on <i>Police</i> Zoo?

10:07.065 --> 10:09.727
5.2 Nielsen, <i>7</i> in share and a TVQ of 3.

10:09.901 --> 10:10.652
Towel!

10:10.819 --> 10:12.150
Your brother?

10:14.364 --> 10:16.776
- Towel.
- Your only brother.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.487
Oh, God, Grace. Give it to me.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.361
Get that.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.870
Towel, towel.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.906
- Mr. Cross' office.
- Towel. VHS.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.496
- Thank you.
- Most of these are towels.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.876
Be wrong once, OK?

10:30.046 --> 10:32.162
Mr. Rhinelander's on his way down.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.635
Booze.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.387
Pardon me.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.632
Excuse me.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.136
Grace.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.730
Put yourself down for a towel, too.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.152
What about my bonus?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.397
Towel and a face cloth.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.686
Shit!

10:56.072 --> 10:57.688
- Frank.
- Hey, Pres.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.823
- What a surprise.
- Grace.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.654
You look great.
You've been working out.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.318
Why didn't you tell me, Grace?

11:03.496 --> 11:06.204
Preston, just looking at some
of this ink we're getting on Scrooge.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.990
Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.253
Can you believe
the first director didn't want her?

11:10.420 --> 11:11.410
- No.
- Well, he does now.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.749
He go bye-bye.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.959
Hey, did you catch her buy
on Tiny Tim?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.249
She doesn't just throw away
the crutches and walk.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.917
She throws away the crutches,

11:19.095 --> 11:22.178
vaults over a lamppost,
double somersault,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.597
back into one of these things.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.053
- Frank.
- Killer.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.217
Yes, Preston?

11:27.395 --> 11:30.808
Have you any idea how many cats
there are in this country?

11:34.277 --> 11:35.358
No.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.394
I don't have those... No.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.030
Twenty-seven million.
Do you know how many dogs?

11:41.492 --> 11:43.278
- In America?
- Forty-eight million.

11:43.453 --> 11:47.037
- Wow.
- We spend $4 billion on pet food alone.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.572
Four?

11:48.875 --> 11:51.617
Now, I have here a study
from Hampstead University

11:51.794 --> 11:55.662
which shows us that cats and dogs
are beginning to watch television.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.878
Now, if these scientists are right,

11:59.135 --> 12:00.921
we should start programming right now.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.224
Within 2O years,
they could become steady viewers.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.722
Programming for cats?

12:08.853 --> 12:10.560
Walk with me, Frank.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.019
Call the police.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.950
Now, I'm not saying,
build a whole show around animals.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.244
- Oh, no.
- All I'm suggesting

12:24.410 --> 12:27.493
is that we occasionally throw in
a little pet appeal.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.374
Some birds, a squirrel.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.326
- Mice.
- Mice. Exactly.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.955
Remember Kojak and the lollipops?

12:34.337 --> 12:37.830
What about a cop that dangles string?
That's his gimmick.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.385
Lots of quick, random action.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.094
Frank, wasn't there
a dormouse in Scrooge?

12:44.264 --> 12:47.848
No. But now that you say it,
I always felt that it needed a dormouse.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.008
- Dormice. Better.
- Bingo.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.263
Frank, this show is the jewel
in the IBC crown.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.143
Everything is riding on it.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.651
Don't worry, Preston. I'm overseeing
every aspect of production.

12:59.821 --> 13:00.982
We'll own Christmas.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.283
That's what I wanted to hear.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.526
- Lunch tomorrow? Chez Jay?
- Right.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.865
- Up, Sid.
- Yes, sir.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.291
- Study this.
- Thank you.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.909
Oh, God.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.326
If only I could fire
that poor son of a bitch.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.963
Hey, Frank!
Hold that door, will you, pops?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.669
Wait for me a minute, will you?
You don't mind?

13:21.843 --> 13:24.210
Hey, it's Brice Cummings.
We met at Spago.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.673
Have you seen Preston?

13:26.389 --> 13:27.720
Preston just went back upstairs.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.848
I just dropped by to say hello.
I went to school with the big guy's son.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.930
You give me a call
when you hit the Coast, OK'?

13:33.104 --> 13:36.062
Let's go. You know, so, anyway.
So, Cosell said...

13:46.534 --> 13:48.946
Come here. Slam this door. Hard.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.535
Grace, I need a full report
on a guy named Brice Cummings.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.372
He's an LA slimeball.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.910
OK.
You're due at Helmsley Palace at 7:00.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.545
- And I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna take...
- No, you're not.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.251
You're staying here with me.
We're working late.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.915
I have to take my son to the doctor.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.585
Grace, when I work late, you work late.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.549
But I made the appointment
two months ago.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.259
I care!

14:10.433 --> 14:13.516
We're indivisible. If I'm
working late, you gotta work late!

14:13.686 --> 14:16.144
If you can't work late,
I can't work late!

14:16.314 --> 14:20.228
If I can't work late, I can't work late!

14:24.822 --> 14:26.938
Oh, your brother's waiting inside.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.201
Oh, and I didn't tell him
about his great Christmas towel.

14:37.627 --> 14:38.833
Francis.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.287
A little bit rough on her out there,
weren't you?

14:42.799 --> 14:45.461
You know what they say about
treating people badly on the way up?

14:45.635 --> 14:46.841
Yep.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.423
You get to treat them badly
on the way down, too.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.760
It's great.
You get two chances to rough them up.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.603
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.984
Why don't the cops
do something about this?

15:05.154 --> 15:06.269
Excuse me, please.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.610
Great. Rip off the hicks, why don't you?
Did you learn this song yesterday?

15:09.784 --> 15:10.819
Sweet.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.155
Frank, you don't like Christmas much,
do you?

15:13.329 --> 15:15.070
Like it? I love it.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.489
It's cold. The people stay home
and watch television.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.203
Ad revenues go up 30%.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.039
All these idiots are gonna be home
watching the boob tube for rne tonight.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.295
I am the biggest fan
that Christmas ever had.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.457
So, any chance of you maybe
making Christmas dinner this year?

15:27.635 --> 15:28.625
None.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.669
- Come on. Why not?
- Don't start, James.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.384
Come on, the whole family will be there.
It'll be fun.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.141
Look, you can have your concerned
and wonderful dinner

15:36.310 --> 15:37.471
with all your cool friends

15:37.645 --> 15:40.387
and the real popcorn and the tree
and cranberries and everything,

15:40.565 --> 15:43.102
send Christmas cards to each other
on recycled paper.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.641
It's a crock, James.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.184
It's for kids.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.479
You know, I like seeing you.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.522
I like being with you.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.200
I want you to have a happy New Year.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.531
Taxi!

15:55.788 --> 15:57.119
Merry Christmas.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.655
Taxi!

16:00.209 --> 16:03.247
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped something there.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.791
Hey, that's my cab.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.081
<i>Oh, sir, please. I...</i>

16:08.259 --> 16:09.590
Leona Helmsley's
and step on it, will you?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.342
You son of a bitch,
you should burn in hell!

16:11.512 --> 16:13.719
Bye-bye, grandma. Bye-bye.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.468
I got into broadcasting
because I like to give.

16:20.313 --> 16:24.181
Sometimes I found myself hurting
from giving too much,

16:25.276 --> 16:26.892
and I'd say, "Stop it."

16:29.405 --> 16:31.487
I'm always gonna cherish this.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.232
And all of you.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.078
I should have went in there.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.956
I should have said,
"Frank Cross, you gotta..."

16:55.014 --> 16:57.881
You stinking... You big dog, you...

17:05.858 --> 17:08.236
- $4.85.
- Here's $5.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.121
- Mr. Cross.
- Mr. Cross.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.753
Wasn't he a medical genius?

17:37.098 --> 17:40.966
Calvin, I think "doctor"
is a Latin word for "thief."

17:41.352 --> 17:45.767
$200 I don't have
to tell me that you don't speak.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.599
I'm your mother.
I know you don't speak...

17:48.818 --> 17:49.808
“Vet.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.312
We'll show them, honey.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.656
You're gonna surprise a lot of people.

17:56.826 --> 17:57.987
Yes, you are.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.580
You start talking,

18:00.746 --> 18:02.908
then go to law school
and sue his butt off.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.163
OK.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.254
Come!

18:15.886 --> 18:17.297
Who's there?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.040
This office is closed!

18:47.710 --> 18:49.326
This whole wing is closed!

18:49.920 --> 18:51.297
Grace!

18:51.464 --> 18:52.795
Grace!

19:12.276 --> 19:13.778
That was a good one.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.520
How are you, kid? You're...

19:18.908 --> 19:21.991
Will you excuse me?
I'll make myself a little drink.

19:33.089 --> 19:36.753
I don't mind you hitting me, Frank,
but take it easy on the Bacardi.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.223
God.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.058
To old times, my friend.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.860
<i>Oh, my God. It's...</i>

20:05.037 --> 20:08.871
Lew Hayward.
Your old boss and your best friend.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.497
But you're...

20:15.089 --> 20:16.830
-."dead.
- Seven years.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.007
Has it been that long? Jeez, <i>I...</i>

20:20.177 --> 20:23.920
I mean, to look at you, I wouldn't
have guessed more than three, tops.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.588
Oh, Frank.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.882
Frank, you are in trouble.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.017
- Big trouble.
- All right.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.178
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

20:32.356 --> 20:34.097
that you're right,
that I am in big trouble.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.515
What exactly would that mean?

20:35.693 --> 20:38.401
Look at me. Look at your future.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.733
Now, if you don't change your ways,

20:40.906 --> 20:44.319
you're gonna wind up doomed,
just as I am.

20:46.829 --> 20:50.072
One minute I'm on the 14th hole
at Winged Foot,

20:50.249 --> 20:51.660
lining up a putt.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.502
A heart attack later, I'm a worm feast.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.457
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.008
You're not a worm feast.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.634
You're a hallucination
brought on by alcohol!

21:02.803 --> 21:05.295
Russian vodka poisoned by Chernobyl!

21:06.015 --> 21:07.676
I've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.761
- I've been putting on a big...
- Silence!

21:12.062 --> 21:13.803
I had it all.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.847
I was a captain of industry,

21:17.067 --> 21:19.980
feared by men, adored by women.

21:20.154 --> 21:24.569
Adored! Let's be honest, Lew.
You paid for the women.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.656
I'm warning you, Frank.
Don't waste your life as I did mine.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.867
Waste? How can you say that.
You're a legend in this business.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.657
You are the man
who invented the miniseries.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.496
Mankind should have been my business.

21:36.712 --> 21:40.330
Charity, mercy, kindness,
that should have been my business.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.624
Don't wait. Get yourself involved.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.588
Now it's too late for me,
but it's not for you.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.093
You can be saved.

21:46.263 --> 21:50.507
You are going to be visited
by three ghosts.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.475
- Three ghosts.
- Three ghosts, Frank.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.729
Expect the first one tomorrow at noon.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.432
God, tomorrow's bad for me, Lew.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.318
As a matter of fact,
the whole rest of the week is a washout.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.570
Well, maybe we could have drinks,
say, Thursday.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.401
You, me, the ghost.
Trader Vic's around 4:00'?

22:06.575 --> 22:09.613
This is no joke, Frank.
This is your last chance!

22:09.787 --> 22:12.745
All right.
I could squeeze you in for a breakfast.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.582
Oh, no, please.
They'll think I'm a suicide.

22:20.214 --> 22:21.329
No.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.415
Oh, God.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.377
We're way up here. Give me a break.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.213
- You can be saved.
- Don't let go!

22:30.391 --> 22:32.598
- Don't let me go, Lew! God bless you!
- You've got time!

22:33.143 --> 22:35.430
No, no. No, please!

22:41.944 --> 22:44.356
- Merry Christmas.
- Don't let me go, Lew!

23:07.720 --> 23:10.132
<i>Hi, this is Claire Phillips.
I'm not here, as usual.</i>

23:10.306 --> 23:12.172
Leave a <i>message for</i> me
<i>and I'll call you right back.</i>

23:12.349 --> 23:14.056
<i>Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</i>

23:14.602 --> 23:16.058
<i>Speak at the beep.</i>

23:17.229 --> 23:18.640
Claire!

23:20.065 --> 23:22.181
This is Frank Cross.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.809
I know it's been...

23:26.614 --> 23:27.649
<i>...15</i> years since we talked

23:29.199 --> 23:31.816
but I really need
to talk to you right now.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.326
<i>I...</i> Something terrible has happened.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.828
Or maybe not. I don't know. But <i>I...</i>

23:40.002 --> 23:42.835
Whatever, I have to talk to you,
no matter what. It's urgent.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.495
Call me at any hour.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.290
My number is 674-9565.

23:47.676 --> 23:51.260
674-95... Damn!

24:20.250 --> 24:21.376
Well?

24:21.877 --> 24:24.414
- Well, what?
- Did you get the bonus?

24:26.507 --> 24:28.498
I'm drying my head with it.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.715
Hey, we'll be all right. Don't worry.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.052
- What are you doing in there?
- Trimming the tree.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.718
- We don't have a tree, Morn.
- We do now.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.770
- No!
- Yes.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.806
Don't plug him in!

24:44.984 --> 24:45.974
Plug him in.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.069
- Look at the little angel.
- Take it off. Take it off.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.354
Take it off of him.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.819
But, Morn, he looks so pretty.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.950
He look even cuter than last year.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.235
Look at Granny, darling.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.245
Morn, when are we going
to get a real tree?

24:59.581 --> 25:00.707
When they're free.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.284
Have you seen
this morning's paper, Frank?

25:05.462 --> 25:08.955
- Who's that? She's pretty.
- She's dead, Frank.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.340
Apparently,
this 80-year-old grandmother

25:11.510 --> 25:14.343
was watching your Scrooge promo
last night and she just...

25:14.513 --> 25:16.379
She just keeled over.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.590
It scared her to death.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.013
This is terrific!

25:25.733 --> 25:27.599
I knew that ad worked!

25:28.485 --> 25:30.943
You can't buy publicity like this!

25:33.407 --> 25:34.647
Excuse me.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.993
Mr. Cross, you're needed on the set.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.373
I want that promo run every half hour.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.908
I want a disclaimer at the top.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.248
"Anyone with a heart condition
must leave the room."

25:48.422 --> 25:49.412
Will do, Frank.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.876
<i>Right. Where were we?</i>

25:51.133 --> 25:53.044
<i>Buzz, I was being haunted.</i>

25:53.218 --> 25:54.208
<i>OK.</i>

25:54.386 --> 25:56.468
No, it's gotta be real gold.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.379
I don't understand...

25:58.557 --> 25:59.968
You can't do this
at the eleventh hour.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.473
...why I can't
possibly get anybody

26:01.643 --> 26:02.974
- to do what I want them to do.
- Oh, jeez.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.556
- Give me a break.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Cross.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.472
I am the censor, and I will not
allow this costume on the air.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.639
Why not?

26:08.817 --> 26:12.276
Well, specifically,
you can see her nipples.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.107
I want to see her nipples!

26:14.281 --> 26:16.488
But this is a Christmas show!

26:16.658 --> 26:19.946
Well, Charles Dickens would have
wanted to see her nipples then.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.949
You can hardly see them nipples.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.581
See? And these guys are really looking.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.534
You can go shake a tail feather.
Thanks.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.748
And thank you. You can just go.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.833
Watch out.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.257
Thanks, boys. Get the nurse.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.877
Get the nurse. Get the nurse!

26:38.472 --> 26:40.338
Make sure her nipples are covered up,
will you?

26:40.516 --> 26:41.506
Lumpy!

26:43.268 --> 26:44.258
Lumpy!

26:57.825 --> 26:58.815
Hi.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.948
I'm sorry to just...

27:04.123 --> 27:06.535
Well, I didn't get your message
until this morning.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.951
And I tried to call but they
said that you weren't in yet.

27:10.129 --> 27:14.088
And then I tried to call back and they
said that you were busy, so I just...

27:15.342 --> 27:17.003
God, you look different.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.255
Well, it's been a while.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.925
It's your hair.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.641
I've never seen it so short.
It makes you look sort of

27:25.811 --> 27:26.801
grown-up.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.016
Yo, Frank. Frank!

27:30.190 --> 27:32.522
I mean, Mr. Cross. Check this out, man.

27:32.693 --> 27:36.561
Girls are tough. It's on the money.
Check it. Come on. Here we go, ladies.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.604
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

27:38.782 --> 27:40.614
Five, six, seven, hit it!

27:44.413 --> 27:46.154
- Can I turn her head?
- No.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.368
All right. That works. See?

27:48.542 --> 27:51.000
And boom! And boom!

27:51.170 --> 27:53.002
Little booty here for you.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.914
See'? Show me a nipple.

27:56.091 --> 27:59.550
See, you just had to see it in context.
Can you move her, please? Thanks.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.176
Alley-OOP-

28:02.181 --> 28:03.387
Is she gonna be all right?

28:03.557 --> 28:07.095
Oh, yeah. She's a real pro.
She's very professional.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.015
What about you?
You sounded like you'd seen a ghost.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.025
A ghost?

28:13.942 --> 28:16.104
You mean the phone call last night?

28:17.571 --> 28:20.654
I came across your number
and I just had to call you immediately.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.988
I know you, Lumpy. I know that voice.
That was the frightened Lumpy I heard.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.402
Excuse me, Lumpy.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.322
Around these parts,
most people call me Mr. Cross.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.581
I'm sorry.
I'm new here and I got a problem.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.083
I'll bet. What?

28:33.253 --> 28:35.335
Well, my problem is this little fella.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.290
I can't get the antlers glued
onto this little guy.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.175
We've tried Krazy Glue,
but it don't work.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.461
- Have you tried staples?
- Staples?

28:43.639 --> 28:44.845
Don't you dare.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.598
If you staple that little mouse,
I'll call the Humane Society.

28:47.768 --> 28:48.758
I'm not kidding.

28:48.936 --> 28:50.722
I wouldn't do anything in the world
to hurt this little fella.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.558
Hey, Marlin Perkins. The road.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.767
I have three dogs and a cat at home.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.684
Oh, beautiful story.
Tell <i>Reader's</i> Digest, will you?

28:59.154 --> 29:00.394
Staples?

29:02.115 --> 29:03.776
Same old Claire.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.033
Still trying to save the world.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.948
You still trying to run it?

29:10.707 --> 29:12.323
Hip-hop, hip-hop. Let's go.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.742
- Get out of here!
- Oh, OK.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.083
- You called me.
- Who are you anyway'?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.289
You little worm.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.505
Who are you? How'd you get in here?

29:23.679 --> 29:26.671
Well, maybe you'll answer some
questions downtown, huh, my friend?

29:26.848 --> 29:28.759
What the hell is going on?

29:29.851 --> 29:32.809
- This is my little boy.
- All right, you beat him.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.429
- Does he work here?
- No, he does not.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.850
I thought it would be fun for him
to see a live television show.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.018
You see anybody having fun here?

29:43.198 --> 29:44.939
Why are you so angry?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.404
Why haven't you ever learned
how to button a coat?

29:47.577 --> 29:48.783
Well...

29:48.996 --> 29:51.488
You know me. I just... I was in a hurry.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.366
- Heads up.
- Heads up. Ladder coming through.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.964
I'm sorry
to have called so late last night.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.091
I must have woken up
your husband and your kids.

30:04.261 --> 30:08.175
No, no. I've never gotten married.
I'm still on my own.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.338
YOu?

30:10.642 --> 30:11.723
No.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.304
- No?
- No.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.930
Would you hold
the goddamn hammering, please?

30:18.108 --> 30:20.270
- Yes, sir.
- I better go. You're busy.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.230
No! No, don't go.

30:22.404 --> 30:26.363
Would you hold
the goddamn hammering,

30:26.533 --> 30:27.819
- please?
- Frank.

30:28.118 --> 30:30.359
Frank, what did happen last night?

30:32.581 --> 30:33.992
Claire, it was something that I ate.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.999
It was probably a bad clam
or something. We don't know yet.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.413
Well, if it happens again...

30:44.426 --> 30:47.964
...give me a call here.
I'm hardly ever home.

30:48.138 --> 30:51.301
I'm definitely gonna call
because I'm a seafood nut.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.682
And, you know, to not eat clams <i>is...</i>

30:53.852 --> 30:55.092
What the hell's life for?

30:58.106 --> 31:01.474
Would you please, for the love of God,

31:01.651 --> 31:04.313
and your own body,
hold the hammering?

31:05.030 --> 31:06.236
Claire.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.065
Sir, it's the Times. They want
a reaction to the woman's death.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.153
Well, we slapped her in the face
and got her attention.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.614
It was probably something she ate.

31:12.788 --> 31:15.655
He said that it was
probably something that she ate.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.620
This is Frank Cross.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.912
We at IBC are shocked and appalled
by this senseless tragedy.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.126
Corning as it does
at this season of giving...

31:24.299 --> 31:27.917
Would you please hold
the goddamn hammering?

31:28.095 --> 31:29.335
NOW!

31:29.513 --> 31:30.628
You got it.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.145
Oh, shit!

31:42.818 --> 31:44.400
I'm going to lunch.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.728
So, how's everything going, Frank?

31:47.906 --> 31:49.943
Couldn't be better, Preston.

31:50.117 --> 31:53.655
Mr. Rhinelander, hello. Mr. Cross.

31:53.829 --> 31:56.036
May I get you gentlemen
something from the bar?

31:56.206 --> 31:58.163
Yes. I'd like a highball.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.869
I'll have a highball, too.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.959
You've heard from the embassy?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.339
Yes, everything's fine.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.174
We're gonna be switching live

32:13.348 --> 32:17.216
back and forth from our Scrooge
in the studio to Berlin

32:17.394 --> 32:20.432
where we've got LeRoy Neiman
painting the Wall for us.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.346
Then we're gonna shoot on
out to Africa

32:22.524 --> 32:25.437
where the Holy Father is gonna
bless the entire Zulu nation.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.443
We think it's the largest baptism
of all time.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.354
That's just the point, Frank.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.694
I'm afraid you might be
spreading yourself a little thin.

32:32.868 --> 32:36.702
So I've taken the liberty
of hiring somebody to work with you.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.909
- Oh, great.
- I knew you'd be pleased.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.199
I couldn't be more pleased.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.709
- Who is it?
- Pellegrino, rocks, twist.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.043
Well, we meet again, huh?
How are you?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.628
Oh, look at this.
Blue is a bad color for New York.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.339
Frank, I realize
this is coming at you pretty damn fast,

32:53.513 --> 32:56.631
but I want you to understand
that my only function here

32:56.808 --> 32:59.140
is to take some of the burden
off of your shoulders.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.224
A lot of men in your position
would see me as a threat.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.603
It's only natural.

33:03.899 --> 33:04.980
That's me.

33:05.150 --> 33:09.064
<i>You are going to be visited
by three ghosts.</i>

33:09.237 --> 33:12.229
<i>Expect the first one tomorrow at noon.</i>

33:12.407 --> 33:14.648
Frank, I realize
this is coming at you pretty damn fast,

33:14.826 --> 33:16.783
but I want you to understand
that my only function here

33:16.953 --> 33:18.785
is to take some of the burden
off of your shoulders.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.912
A lot of men in your position
would see me as a threat.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.823
It's only natural.
But, whoop, that's me.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.459
Have you ever seen a watch like this?
It's a real beauty, isn't it?

33:25.629 --> 33:26.664
My dad gave me this.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.132
<i>But...</i>

33:38.975 --> 33:42.468
But when Preston hired me this morning

33:42.646 --> 33:43.977
as a sort of, what?

33:44.147 --> 33:46.605
A consultant, I suppose you might say,

33:46.942 --> 33:50.105
I said to him,
"Consider me just one of the team."

33:53.114 --> 33:55.071
My lacrosse coach used to say,

33:55.242 --> 33:58.155
"There is no 'l' in T-E-A-M."

33:58.328 --> 34:00.444
Here we are, gentlemen.

34:00.622 --> 34:01.828
- This one for you, sir.
- Thank you.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.989
And one for you.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.851
- I'm terribly sorry. <i>I...</i>
- Are you him?

34:25.647 --> 34:27.012
Are you him?

34:27.274 --> 34:29.356
Are you he?

34:30.360 --> 34:31.976
I'll take it away.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.645
Now don't...

34:35.907 --> 34:37.614
Don't come apart on me, Frank.

34:39.661 --> 34:40.696
No.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.786
No. What was that
that your lacrosse coach said?

34:43.956 --> 34:45.822
No, the point is, Frank...

34:46.001 --> 34:47.786
Excuse me, gentlemen,
are you ready to order?

34:47.960 --> 34:51.079
Great. Yeah.
I'll have the California health plate.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.838
No dairy in that, huh?

34:53.550 --> 34:56.713
- How's the rack of lamb today, Bobby?
- Excellent choice, sir.

34:57.679 --> 34:58.965
Sir?

35:00.724 --> 35:01.885
Oh, my God.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.009
Bobby.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.889
Bobby, look! Somebody save him!

35:07.063 --> 35:08.849
Oh, no. That's a baked Alaska, sir.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.061
No, that's a dessert.
You wouldn't want that, sir.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.192
- Look!
- Oh, no, no, no, sir.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.320
That gentleman had a meatloaf.
You wouldn't want that, sir.

35:17.490 --> 35:20.357
It's not very... It's full of... Sir?

35:21.369 --> 35:22.871
- I'm gonna have...
- Have?

35:23.038 --> 35:24.494
- I'm gonna have...
- Have?

35:24.664 --> 35:26.325
I'm gonna go have some air.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.830
Excuse me.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.673
I'm sorry.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.340
You know,
I thought you were Richard Pryor.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.818
- Get me a cab!
- Yes, sir.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.412
All right, out through the park
and take me over <i>to...</i>

36:13.004 --> 36:14.244
Hey, man!

36:17.425 --> 36:18.756
Watch out!

36:29.437 --> 36:30.768
Wrong way, jerk!

36:30.939 --> 36:33.055
Nice hit back there! Solid hit!

36:33.983 --> 36:37.476
- You're going the wrong way!
- Relax, Frank. Enjoy the ride.

36:37.654 --> 36:41.113
- How do you know my name?
- I know absolutely everything, Frank.

36:41.282 --> 36:44.570
You see, I'm the ghost.

36:56.756 --> 37:00.294
- You don't mind if I smoke, do you?
- Smoke! Smoke! Just drive!

37:11.896 --> 37:13.182
Oh, thanks, pal.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.651
What did you do?
What did you do? What did you do?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.159
That's not funny! Not funny!

37:33.501 --> 37:36.118
All right! Pull over! Pull over!

37:43.094 --> 37:45.051
- Where are we?
- "Where are we?"

37:45.221 --> 37:47.337
You mean, "When are we?"

37:53.062 --> 37:54.348
Look out!

37:56.649 --> 37:59.391
Go back to Jersey, you moron!

38:01.696 --> 38:05.530
- Take me home right now.
- You got it, pal.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.074
Welcome home, Frankie.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.536
Oh, my God!

38:21.299 --> 38:23.256
This is where I grew up.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.380
- I thought they tore this place down.
- They did.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.216
Guess my dad hasn't put up
our Christmas lights yet.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.928
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Frank,
it's Christmas Eve.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.648
I get it.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.149
You're taking me back in time
to show rne my mother and father,

38:40.318 --> 38:42.559
and I'm supposed to get
all goosey and blubbery.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.819
Well, forget it pal,
you got the wrong guy.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.481
That's exactly what Attila the Hun said.

38:47.742 --> 38:51.781
But when he saw his mother,
Niagara Falls.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.154
Let's get this over with.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.590
That was a great joke.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.588
I love that bit!

39:11.266 --> 39:13.428
Quiet. Somebody will call the cops.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.222
Oh, relax, Frank.

39:16.396 --> 39:20.890
They can't hear us. They can't see us.
This is not live. It's like a rerun.

39:21.109 --> 39:22.474
Check it out.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.314
<i>See? Here I am.</i>

39:25.488 --> 39:28.025
<i>We all drink our
chocolate-flavored Ovaltine every day</i>

39:28.199 --> 39:30.281
<i>to help give us what we need
for rocket power.</i>

39:32.745 --> 39:34.452
<i>The Lone Ranger!</i>

39:39.294 --> 39:40.284
<i>That's the...</i>

39:46.467 --> 39:48.253
Hello, Earl.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.642
Here, Francis.

39:57.812 --> 40:01.305
I've got something for you.
Merry Christmas.

40:01.900 --> 40:05.393
<i>- A choc-choc tram'?
- No, W's five pounds of veaL.</i>

40:06.821 --> 40:10.030
But, Daddy,
I asked Santa for a choo-choo.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.992
Then go out and get a job
and buy a choo-choo.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.661
Earl, he's only four years old.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.994
All day long, I listen to people
give excuses why they can't work.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.830
"My back hurts. My legs ache.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.378
I'm only four!"

40:26.799 --> 40:28.631
The sooner he learns
that life isn't given to you

40:28.801 --> 40:30.508
on a silver platter, the better!

40:34.182 --> 40:37.265
<i>You know, we've all been doing
everything we possibly can...</i>

40:37.435 --> 40:38.766
I'm going up.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.097
Baby, don't watch too much TV.
It's bad for your eyes.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.436
OK, Mommy.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.027
Merry Christmas, Frankie angel.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.484
Merry Christmas to you, Mama.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.041
Niagara Falls, Frankie angel.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.722
I was touched by a gift.

41:18.559 --> 41:21.051
A four-year-old kid receives
what in today's marketplace

41:21.229 --> 41:24.017
is a $40 or $50 piece of milk-fed veal.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.191
Frank, you still spent
the next 15 years of your life

41:28.361 --> 41:29.943
sitting on your ass watching television.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.901
Check the records, chump.
I did some stuff.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.323
I was a baseball player.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.905
One year, I hit the home run
that won the big game.

41:38.079 --> 41:41.413
<i>That was the kid
on The Courtship of Eddie's Father.</i>

41:45.086 --> 41:46.451
There was another time, though,

41:46.629 --> 41:49.087
that I was running down a hillside
that was covered with flowers,

41:49.257 --> 41:52.670
and there was a beautiful girl,
like 15, with pigtails.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.505
- And she was waiting for me.
- You are so pathetic!

41:54.679 --> 41:56.340
And her parents didn't know
she snuck out of the house.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.097
<i>That was
the Little House on the Prairie!</i>

42:02.854 --> 42:04.595
Was it the "Homecoming" episode
of <i>Little</i> House?

42:04.772 --> 42:07.935
Yes, it was the "Homecoming" episode
of <i>Little</i> House.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.315
Let's face it, Frank.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.897
Garden slugs got more out of life
than you did.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.358
Name one.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.528
Take me to my office.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.029
Gladly!

42:22.290 --> 42:23.826
- Where are we?
- It's your office.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.458
- Isn't that where you wanted to go?
- What's going on?

42:26.961 --> 42:28.326
It's their Christmas party.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.461
They've had Christmas parties here

42:30.631 --> 42:32.713
since the dawn
of the golden age of television.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.296
Till you took over, you big stiff.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.422
Merry Christmas. Pass those out.

42:45.855 --> 42:48.438
Brook, Brook. Hey, wait for me.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.533
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, Fred! Fred!

43:00.703 --> 43:03.445
- It's Frank, Mr. Hayward.
- Frank.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.406
You didn't happen to notice
a big Christmas party

43:06.584 --> 43:09.076
- going on around here, did you?
- Yes, I did see one, sir.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.335
I'm gonna be right on it.
I'm just gonna finish this.

43:11.506 --> 43:12.587
OK.

43:14.509 --> 43:17.422
- Merry Christmas!
- Why, thank you, Tina.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.046
- Frank! Frank!
- Oh, hi.

43:21.224 --> 43:23.135
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Tina.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.471
You're not leaving, are you?
You wanna go get some Chinese food?

43:25.645 --> 43:27.727
Oh, wow, no.
You're not supposed to eat that stuff.

43:27.897 --> 43:29.854
They found out that
they're cutting up the alley cats

43:30.024 --> 43:31.731
and using them in chop suey.
It's a real bummer.

43:31.901 --> 43:33.437
Don't eat that stuff.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.270
You idiot! You moron, get back there!

43:37.573 --> 43:39.029
I don't believe myself.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.736
What an idiot I am!

43:40.910 --> 43:42.241
Did you see that Tina?

43:42.411 --> 43:44.948
Frankie, I'm not that dead.
Now come on.

43:45.123 --> 43:48.707
I must have been out of my mind!
She was crazy about me.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.254
Not that one, Frankie. Not that one.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.410
This one.

43:55.258 --> 43:58.467
Cupid's arrow, right between the eyes.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.003
Oh, God! Are you all right?

44:01.180 --> 44:03.558
You know,
you probably shouldn't move someone

44:03.724 --> 44:05.715
who's had a bad blow to the head.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.936
- Where did I get you'?
- You got me right here.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.858
And the sidewalk got me back here.

44:17.196 --> 44:20.234
It's gonna be quite a lump.
I'm sorry. Here.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.369
Is this yours?

44:26.747 --> 44:28.579
Yes, it is. Thank you.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.495
You had some things, didn't you?

44:31.669 --> 44:32.830
- Yes.
- Here.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.128
All right. Tell you what.
I'll go down for them.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.259
OK. Good idea.

44:41.429 --> 44:43.921
- Wait for me. Yeah?
- Yes, I'll wait.

44:51.189 --> 44:53.430
- Thanks, Lumpy.
- Thank you.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.225
- Merry Christmas.
- Say,

44:57.445 --> 44:59.106
would you like to go
to a Christmas party

44:59.280 --> 45:01.521
- that's going on right now?
- Not really.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.030
Neither would I.

45:04.660 --> 45:05.650
Young lady!

45:07.121 --> 45:08.657
Do you shop here all the time?

45:08.831 --> 45:11.573
Because if you do, I can walk
on the other side of the street.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.675
Would you like
to go get some Chinese food?

45:26.015 --> 45:29.258
- All right, what's going on?
- You are gonna love this.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.601
- Claire?
- Yeah.

45:31.771 --> 45:33.307
Claire?

45:34.065 --> 45:36.432
Yeah, what is it? I'm in the tub.

45:36.651 --> 45:38.938
Can't we open the presents now?

45:40.488 --> 45:41.899
What are you doing?

45:42.073 --> 45:43.279
Oh, come on, don't be a creep.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.941
- Yeah, you had it all, let me tell you.
- Yeah. Look at something else.

45:46.118 --> 45:48.530
Hey, look, there's a gorilla
climbing up on that big building.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.115
When can we open these?

45:54.293 --> 45:58.161
You can open one on Christmas Eve.
That's what we always did in my family.

45:58.339 --> 46:00.876
You have to wait until
Christmas morning to open the rest.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.165
Isn't that what you did?

46:02.343 --> 46:05.461
Well, if it were gonna spoil,
we opened it the night before.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.797
Well, you wanna open this one?

46:09.225 --> 46:10.807
Is this for me?

46:23.155 --> 46:24.862
Knives!

46:25.283 --> 46:26.944
Oh, good!

46:27.743 --> 46:30.360
Oh, lots of knives.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.369
I got her these great knives.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.281
- They're super sharp.
- I know, I know.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.199
- They don't make them in the States.
- Ginsu knives.

46:36.377 --> 46:37.458
- They are really sharp.
- They cut cans.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.586
You can cut a tin can
as easily as a tomato.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.303
Your turn.

46:46.470 --> 46:50.054
I've never liked a girl enough
to give her 12 sharp knives.

46:51.726 --> 46:54.388
OK. You're gonna like this.

46:56.439 --> 46:57.975
"To Lump."

46:58.649 --> 47:00.606
"Love, Claire."

47:07.116 --> 47:09.073
You're such an animal.

47:13.247 --> 47:16.330
"The Kama Sutra.
The Hindu art of love."

47:17.251 --> 47:18.958
Read the inscription.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.291
No. You read the inscription.
It says "Christmas,"

47:23.466 --> 47:24.672
and then the rest <i>is...</i>

47:24.842 --> 47:26.549
- It's Sanskrit.
- It's Sanskrit.

47:27.053 --> 47:30.512
I didn't need any kind of manual.
I want you to know that.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.718
Don't blow the ending for me now.

47:38.356 --> 47:40.563
- Did that.
- With Who?

47:40.733 --> 47:42.189
- Did it.
- Yeah.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.641
Done this.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.816
Done this. Buddy of mine did this.

47:48.991 --> 47:51.449
Now this is ridiculous.
I don't believe this for a second.

47:51.619 --> 47:53.201
- What?
- Says there's a place that

47:53.371 --> 47:55.658
you can touch a woman
that will make her bark like a dog.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.127
Lassie's come home.

48:03.798 --> 48:06.506
Lassie, go get Gramps.
Go get Gramps, Lassie.

48:07.259 --> 48:09.591
I wonder if you're female.
Let's turn her over and find out.

48:09.762 --> 48:12.971
Hey. Oh, what a nice coat you have.

48:13.140 --> 48:16.053
I think I should
give you a bath every week.

48:21.857 --> 48:23.723
Good morning, kiddos!

48:23.901 --> 48:26.142
This is Mike the Mailman!

48:26.320 --> 48:27.776
Hey, Frisbee!

48:28.656 --> 48:30.738
I got something for you.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.149
Come on. Oh, there he is.

48:33.327 --> 48:35.409
I really gotta watch out
for this one, eh?

48:35.579 --> 48:39.538
What goodies does he have?
Is it a pair of mittens?

48:39.708 --> 48:41.574
It's a bone!

48:42.503 --> 48:45.336
What could it be? Is it a book?

48:45.506 --> 48:47.167
It's a bone!

48:47.508 --> 48:49.465
You can't figure it out,
can you, Frisbee?

48:49.635 --> 48:52.878
It's a bone, you lucky dog!

48:53.055 --> 48:55.433
It's a bone, you betcha!

48:59.019 --> 49:00.851
Oh, kids, isn't this terrific?

49:01.021 --> 49:02.762
Lassie's a pretty good friend, eh?

49:02.940 --> 49:05.648
And we're into
a commercial break, folks.

49:13.409 --> 49:16.367
- Very good, kid. Very good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

49:16.537 --> 49:18.244
So, how many reservations
should I make?

49:18.414 --> 49:21.372
Oh, yes. There'll be you, me, my wife...

49:21.542 --> 49:23.579
No, your wife's in Palm Springs.

49:23.752 --> 49:26.414
Oh, yes, yes. I forgot. Of course.

49:26.589 --> 49:29.172
Well, I guess then
it will be you and rne.

49:31.552 --> 49:34.715
And Frank. Frank, I want you
to have dinner with us tonight.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.175
- You and your girl.
- Claire.

49:36.348 --> 49:37.554
Right, Claire.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.099
And order us a stretch limo, too.
See you downstairs.

49:40.269 --> 49:41.600
OK.

49:42.938 --> 49:46.056
- Hello. Why, you're Claire.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.895
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

49:50.696 --> 49:52.278
You almost ready?

49:53.991 --> 49:56.232
The president of the network
just invited us to dinner.

49:56.410 --> 49:57.525
Oh, no, we can't tonight.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.910
We're going to
David and Kate's for dinner.

50:00.080 --> 50:01.616
We planned it for a month.

50:01.790 --> 50:04.623
But you can't expect a man like this
to make plans a month in advance.

50:04.793 --> 50:06.921
We can have dinner with them
next week.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.293
Next week?

50:08.464 --> 50:10.626
It's Christmas Eve.
They're our best friends.

50:10.799 --> 50:12.540
It only comes once a year.

50:12.718 --> 50:14.174
Thanks,PhH,babe.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.010
Yeah, it is Christmas.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.342
It's a time to be
a little bit less selfish, you know.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.975
Maybe if you could put my needs
and the needs of the Frisbee Show

50:22.144 --> 50:23.646
ahead of your own needs...

50:23.812 --> 50:26.474
I mean, I have been fighting
for the integrity of this show.

50:26.649 --> 50:27.810
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

50:27.983 --> 50:30.395
- I'm sorry.
- Sixty seconds!

50:31.529 --> 50:34.521
I guess I didn't realize
how important it is to you.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.445
Well, I'm willing to forgive you
once in a while. I am.

50:39.912 --> 50:40.902
Frank, look.

50:42.122 --> 50:45.205
Maybe we should separate for a while.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.167
- Excuse me.
- Estelle?

50:48.337 --> 50:49.372
- Yeah?
- When is that limo leaving?

50:49.547 --> 50:52.289
Oh, right after the show.
You know how he is.

50:53.092 --> 50:54.457
For a while

50:55.094 --> 50:56.380
and see how it goes.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.841
I mean, I know you've been
under a lot of pressure.

51:01.141 --> 51:02.643
Oh, it's been rough.

51:11.110 --> 51:13.943
All right.
I'll try to come over later if I can.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.361
Fifteen seconds.

51:24.832 --> 51:27.073
I'll tell them that you got hung up.

51:29.378 --> 51:30.664
Lumpy-

51:33.382 --> 51:34.998
Merry Christmas.

51:38.470 --> 51:42.680
Five, four, three, two, one.

51:42.850 --> 51:43.840
<i>OK, kiddos...</i>

51:44.018 --> 51:47.136
<i>You left Claire for Frisbee the Dog?</i>

51:48.272 --> 51:50.604
Frank, let me sum this up for you.

51:50.774 --> 51:54.187
You don't know who you are,
you don't know what you want,

51:54.361 --> 51:57.353
and you don't know
what the hell is going on.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.697
I've made a few mistakes.

52:00.242 --> 52:01.778
I gotta live with that.

52:03.203 --> 52:05.285
But I know who I am.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.530
I know what I want.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.073
And I know what's going on.

52:09.918 --> 52:12.000
<i>Hey, Frank. Over here.</i>

52:12.171 --> 52:13.536
What's going on?

52:13.714 --> 52:16.331
<i>How am I supposed to know?
I'm only the ghost.</i>

52:16.508 --> 52:19.216
<i>So long, sucker!</i>

52:20.804 --> 52:22.670
Hold on! Hello, taxi!

52:27.936 --> 52:32.305
I have seen your nobler aspirations
fall off one by one

52:32.483 --> 52:35.692
till the master passion, greed,
engrosses you.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.656
Farewell, Ebenezer.

52:39.740 --> 52:42.778
May you be happy
with the path that you have chosen.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.948
Well, I am happy with the path
that I've chosen, you little bitch!

52:47.122 --> 52:48.704
In fact, I couldn't be happier!

52:48.874 --> 52:51.536
What are you? Crazy?

52:51.752 --> 52:53.117
Yeah, Buddy, I'm crazy!

52:53.587 --> 52:55.203
Crazy like a fox!

52:55.381 --> 52:58.089
Crazy enough
to see through your little tricks.

52:58.384 --> 53:00.591
I'm back. I can see now.

53:00.761 --> 53:03.002
No one could have been
that simple and good,

53:03.180 --> 53:07.299
and sweet, and kind, and decent,
yet caring, wonderful.

53:07.476 --> 53:09.808
Not on this planet! No, baby.

53:09.978 --> 53:12.970
Not unless they had something to hide,
some sort of trick up their sleeve.

53:13.148 --> 53:14.934
You wouldn't try to trick me, would you'?

53:15.109 --> 53:18.443
Don't try to trick me today
because I'm back, Jack!

53:18.612 --> 53:22.071
Maybe we'll just check things out
over there at Operation Reach Out.

53:22.408 --> 53:23.398
Pick a side, grandma.

53:23.575 --> 53:24.736
Goodbye. Thank you.

53:24.910 --> 53:27.277
<i>...blood drive. $20</i> a <i>pint.
Come on, folks.</i>

53:27.454 --> 53:30.537
<i>Here's a happy donor.
Thank you so much.</i>

53:31.959 --> 53:33.575
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

53:37.047 --> 53:40.790
Well, just for the record, you left rne.

53:40.968 --> 53:44.131
You had to go somewhere and get
your head together or something.

53:44.304 --> 53:47.092
Well, baby, my head is just fine.
Check it out!

53:47.266 --> 53:48.927
It's right here where it belongs!

53:51.937 --> 53:53.848
What's the point?
It's lonely at the top?

53:54.022 --> 53:55.933
It's not lonely at the top.

53:56.108 --> 53:59.442
Oh, maybe around my birthday
and at sunset.

53:59.611 --> 54:00.988
And there have been
a couple of weekends

54:01.155 --> 54:03.863
that would have raised hell
with even a really normal person!

54:04.700 --> 54:07.362
But that's me. I'm a widow of business.

54:07.703 --> 54:09.944
That's my life! I've chosen it!

54:10.122 --> 54:13.615
At least I work someplace that you can
find when you're looking for it!

54:15.586 --> 54:17.953
OK, here we are now.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.830
When I want a wife,

54:21.049 --> 54:23.006
I'm gonna buy one!

54:24.178 --> 54:26.670
And she's going to be devoted to rne,

54:26.847 --> 54:29.214
to my wants and my needs,

54:29.391 --> 54:30.927
not like you!

54:31.310 --> 54:33.517
Let's face it, you treated me like dirt!

54:33.687 --> 54:35.849
Oh, Lord! Another wild and wooly one.

54:36.023 --> 54:39.141
Honey, you look frozen.
Come over here.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.355
Let me get you a nice hot cup of coffee.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.189
And now you sit right there,
I'll bring it to you.

54:43.363 --> 54:44.615
Robert, get UP!

54:44.782 --> 54:46.568
Hi, Dick. Herman.

54:47.659 --> 54:48.740
I'm Billy.

54:48.911 --> 54:50.652
Eva. Eva. That's me.

54:50.829 --> 54:53.241
- Oh, cocktail hour.
- Drink for Mr. Richard Burton.

54:53.415 --> 54:55.122
- Drink up.
- Here, Dave.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.908
Drink just for me.

54:57.461 --> 54:58.872
For you, Dave.

55:02.049 --> 55:03.631
That Dick sure knows how to live, huh?

55:03.801 --> 55:05.132
Why do you keep calling rne Dick?

55:05.302 --> 55:07.213
I'm sorry, Mr. Burton.

55:07.387 --> 55:10.880
Maybe we don't know you well enough
to call you Dick

55:11.058 --> 55:13.390
<i>but after Exorcist ll</i>
and <i>Night of the Iguana,</i>

55:13.560 --> 55:15.176
we thought we had something special.

55:15.354 --> 55:18.016
So could you please just do
a couple of lines from Hamlet?

55:18.190 --> 55:19.976
<i>- Please.</i>
- Or <i>The Sandpiper?</i>

55:20.150 --> 55:22.107
Leave me alone!

55:22.277 --> 55:25.815
- Do Cleopatra for me, please, Dick.
- Please do it.

55:25.989 --> 55:28.481
- Please, do it for Eva.
- Yeah.

55:28.659 --> 55:31.071
I am Mark Antony...

55:31.245 --> 55:33.612
All those who don't know Abyssinia,

55:33.789 --> 55:36.372
to know the rain
before nightfall of Cheops.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.666
I swear. By thee I full swear.

55:38.836 --> 55:41.419
Oh, isn't that marvelous?

55:41.588 --> 55:43.966
- Now beat it before I beat you!
- Eagles.

55:44.132 --> 55:46.260
- <i>Where Eagles Dare.</i>
- Yeah.

55:48.053 --> 55:51.091
- Lumpy, what a surprise!
- Oh, God! Oh, God! Claire!

55:52.349 --> 55:55.137
- What are you doing here?
- Claire. Claire.

55:55.310 --> 55:57.802
Well, you said if it happened again,
that I should come by.

55:57.980 --> 56:00.517
- Well, what happened?
- Well...

56:02.276 --> 56:05.109
I have been thinking a lot
about the past,

56:05.279 --> 56:07.520
and, you know, when that happens,
you start thinking to yourself,

56:07.698 --> 56:10.235
"Well, I've made a lot of decisions,
you know.

56:10.409 --> 56:12.616
And what would have happened

56:12.786 --> 56:15.073
if I had made different decisions?"

56:16.039 --> 56:17.541
Do you know what I mean?

56:17.708 --> 56:19.415
Are you talking about regret?

56:19.585 --> 56:22.202
Yeah, yeah, I'm talking about regret.
Yeah!

56:22.379 --> 56:25.713
You know, the one good thing about
regret is that it's never too late.

56:25.883 --> 56:28.124
You can always change if you want to.

56:29.011 --> 56:31.844
- I deal with that every day.
- OK, well, deal with this.

56:32.014 --> 56:34.972
I wanna take you someplace right now

56:35.392 --> 56:38.384
and eat Chinese food.

56:38.687 --> 56:41.349
Claire, we got some huge problems
this time!

56:41.523 --> 56:44.481
- There ain't a fuse in the whole joint!
- Oh, no, there are fuses.

56:44.651 --> 56:46.517
I'll show you where they are
in just a second, Hazel.

56:46.695 --> 56:49.027
- The A&P didn't send any turkeys.
- No.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.734
Oh, no, they were
supposed to be here hours ago.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.071
- Not one.
- OK, I'll call them in just a second.

56:54.244 --> 56:55.655
- No...
- Can you wait'? Could you wait for me...

56:55.829 --> 56:57.695
Well, they can handle this.
This isn't a big deal.

56:57.873 --> 56:59.034
I mean, it's just some fuses.

56:59.207 --> 57:00.914
You go down to the hardware store
and you buy fuses.

57:01.084 --> 57:03.746
- What about the turkeys?
- And the turkeys are at the A&P?

57:03.921 --> 57:05.582
- Look it up in the phone book.
- No, no, no.

57:05.756 --> 57:08.544
It's under "A" and if you
can't find it there, it's under

57:08.717 --> 57:10.207
I have to call them myself.
I'll call them in just a second, OK?

57:10.385 --> 57:11.637
You don't have to call them.

57:11.803 --> 57:14.135
These are big girls,
very big girls, and they can do it.

57:14.306 --> 57:16.764
- Attagirl!
- I'll be right... I'll be right there.

57:16.934 --> 57:18.971
- I'll <i>be...</i>
- No, Claire, please. Fire these people.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.930
- Fire them?
- Yeah, you fire them.

57:21.104 --> 57:23.721
They're volunteers. They're here
out of the kindness of their hearts.

57:23.899 --> 57:26.641
They're volunteers because no one
will pay them! They are incompetent!

57:27.527 --> 57:28.733
It's Christmas Eve.

57:28.904 --> 57:32.113
They're like this every day of the year.
I guarantee it!

57:32.950 --> 57:36.568
Look, if you'll just wait one minute,
I just gotta make the phone call...

57:36.745 --> 57:38.201
- No, don't bother.
- Just a couple...

57:38.372 --> 57:41.160
- Don't bother, OK?
- If you'll just wait one minute,

57:41.333 --> 57:43.290
let rne just finish organizing
what I'm doing,

57:43.460 --> 57:44.621
I'll come with you, Frank.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.081
Take the rest of your life!

57:47.047 --> 57:50.415
I'm gonna give you some advice, Claire.
Scrape them off.

57:50.801 --> 57:53.293
You wanna save somebody?
Save yourself.

57:53.470 --> 57:56.804
Oh, that's a wonderful attitude to have
on Christmas Eve.

57:57.641 --> 57:59.257
Merry Christmas.

58:02.896 --> 58:04.307
Bah, humbug!

58:08.860 --> 58:10.191
Lumpy-

58:12.197 --> 58:15.406
Hey, Dick, can you lend me $2
so I can heat my place?

58:15.575 --> 58:17.236
Herman, I blew it all on Liz.

58:17.411 --> 58:19.027
There's a sucker inside.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.319
Thanks.

58:20.664 --> 58:23.531
This is the last dress rehearsal,
so let's get it right.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.213
Come on, Buddy, it's your cue.
Get moving.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.716
<i>Cue, Mr. Houseman.</i>

58:34.886 --> 58:38.925
<i>"Ebenezer Scrooge hurried
past the ragged boys</i>

58:39.099 --> 58:41.636
<i>who stood shivering in the snow,</i>

58:41.810 --> 58:45.269
<i>gnawed and mumbled
by the hungry cold,</i>

58:45.439 --> 58:48.272
<i>as bones are gnawed by dogs."</i>

58:49.067 --> 58:52.605
Why do I have to be molested
by these sea urchins?

58:52.779 --> 58:54.235
- Street urchins?
- No, Buddy, baby.

58:54.406 --> 58:56.568
Look, look, right here, Buddy.
Here's what it says. "Street urchins."

58:56.742 --> 58:59.109
I said "street."
Why would I say sea urchins?

58:59.286 --> 59:01.573
OK, everybody, what'd he say, huh?
Sea urchins, street urchins?

59:01.747 --> 59:03.579
- Street urchins.
- Street, oh, oh.

59:03.749 --> 59:06.741
He did say street urchins?
I'm sorry, Buddy. You're right.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.784
OK everybody.
That's dinner, one hour!

59:08.962 --> 59:11.795
That includes walking time! One hour!

59:12.340 --> 59:14.502
You're doing great.
You're doing great, Buddy.

59:14.676 --> 59:15.711
We need more snow over here.

59:15.886 --> 59:17.502
We gotta
watch that boom shadow, huh?

59:17.679 --> 59:19.465
You're right on my urchins.

59:20.766 --> 59:23.178
Oh, Frank! Man! Baby, how are you?

59:23.351 --> 59:25.843
Oh, God, we were so worried about you.
Are you OK?

59:26.021 --> 59:28.012
Everybody was worried sick, huh?
You all right?

59:28.190 --> 59:30.022
Listen, I call the meal breaks
around here.

59:30.192 --> 59:31.227
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry.

59:31.401 --> 59:33.312
Look, if it means that much to you,
I'll call everybody back

59:33.487 --> 59:34.818
and you can tell them
it's time to go to dinner.

59:34.988 --> 59:38.401
Hey, everybody, hold on a minute,
Frank's got something to say to you!

59:38.575 --> 59:39.815
Go ahead.

59:40.952 --> 59:43.034
I think it's time
you and I had a little talk, Brice.

59:43.205 --> 59:46.163
Frank, I'd love to but, you know,
Preston asked me to stop by for a drink.

59:46.333 --> 59:49.166
So if you don't mind,
I'll take a rain check, OK?

59:49.669 --> 59:52.331
Paul, where are you? I need a cigarette!

59:55.592 --> 59:56.753
<i>Hey-</i>

59:56.927 --> 59:58.167
<i>Hey-</i>

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:02.963
Hey!

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.260
Hey!

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:19.401
Hi, Frank!

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.821
Come on!
Come on out and play with me.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.157
One, two, three, four,

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:28.242
five, six, seven, eight.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.828
...two, three, four,

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.788
five, six, seven, eight.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.707
Oh, I'm a little muddled.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.046
Seven, eight.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.678
One, two, three, four.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.306
Oh, I'm so relieved. It's been so long.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:01:00.529
Hello, Frank.
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.406
I had a funny feeling.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.444
Why did you do that?

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.783
Sometimes you have to
slap them in the face

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.743
just to get their attention.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.409
Fine, slap me in the face.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:16.882
- But you kicked me in the...
- Hush, Frank.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.299
It's time to begin our journey.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.964
And now close your eyes

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.258
- and think...
- No.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.967
- You close your eyes! I'm through...
- Oh, no. Don't be quarrelsome.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.978
Close your eyes and think

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:36.474
of snowflakes, and moonbeams,

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.733
and whiskers on kittens.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:41.152
No peeking!

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:46.404
Of rainbows, forget-me-nots,

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:51.451
of misty meadows
and sun-dappled pools.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:57.711
Oh, look, there's Mr. Hedgehog.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.713
I wonder where he's going.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.250
Perhaps to Harlem!

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.714
Oh! Oh, no!

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.717
I cracked you.

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:11.258
<i>Oh, God, my 'yaw.</i>

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.811
Sometimes the truth is painful, Frank.

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:19.646
But it's made your cheeks all rosy
and your eyes bright as stars.

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:23.279
If you touch me again,

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:26.485
I'm gonna
rip your goddamn wings off, OK?

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:29.948
You know I like the rough stuff,
don't you, Frank?

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.282
Oh, God.

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:34.198
<i>Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle
Jingle, jingle, jingle bells</i>

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.583
<i>~</i> Hi!
<i>~</i> Hi!

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.787
- Come on, Calvin.
- Hey, Calvin.

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:42.127
Merry Christmas, Cooley family!

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.047
Ma, you didn't have to come and get me.
I could have rode the subway.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:48.462
I don't want you riding the subway
at this time of night by yourself.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.630
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.345
- Good.
- Hi, Morn!

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.305
- Come on, Morn.
- Oh, get out of here.

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:56.516
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Morn.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.182
"Hi, Morn." Is that all I'm gonna get?

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:02.811
Well, now I'm gonna get freshened up.
I'm gonna leave in a minute, get ready.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.318
Leave it alone. No one can do it.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:10.905
Shasta, Randee,
you two go wash up now, you hear?

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:12.069
OK, Gramma.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.281
<i>Think of your fellow man</i>

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:18.371
<i>Lend him a helping hand</i>

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:20.752
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:25.090
Oh, look! He did it.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.217
- He's a bright little guy.
- Oh, yes.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.502
What's wrong with him?

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.548
He hasn't spoken since he saw
his father killed five years ago.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:36.765
<i>He just drifted</i> away,
like <i>Sleeping Beauty.</i>

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:39.896
I didn't know
that Grace's husband had died.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.101
Oh, Frank,

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:45.065
don't you remember that period
when she wore black for a year?

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:49.440
I remember her wearing black
but I thought it was a fashion thing.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:52.075
I mean, people
were wearing black, you know.

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:53.747
Oh, Frank.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.870
My, my, poor Frank.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.244
Well, is he gonna be OK?

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:02.961
It's his choice.
Only he can break the spell.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.748
You're gonna be a doctor soon enough.
This is Christmas, honey.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:08.542
Girls, put some love in his heart!

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.711
- Get back!
- A little Christmas loving, go ahead.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.675
<i>A Merry Christmas. God bless us.</i>

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.591
- God <i>bless</i> us, every one.
- Leave me alone! Mama!

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.259
Mama!

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.895
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:22.602
Oh, oh! Come in, Frank.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.767
Come in and join the fun.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:31.448
What a lovely family,
and they're so happy.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:35.202
They're so happy
but so poor, you tightwad!

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.579
I'll check my records.
She may be due for a raise.

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:39.911
- May be?
- Probably!

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:41.450
- Probably?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.210
May be, probably, perhaps?

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.087
I'm almost positive.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:47.213
- Get off your brother!
- Get off me. Leave me alone.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.591
This boy is mine!

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:52.544
That looks like fun!

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.886
Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it!

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.303
Don't forget to watch the show.
I'm taking Calvin with me, Mama.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:05.186
- More! More!
- Hey, come on, Frank.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.226
Next stop's downtown!

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.949
How was your trip, Frank'?
A little jump, huh?

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.996
Hi, Cujo.

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:23.207
Bark! Bark!

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.327
Who is here?

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.457
- What are you barking at out there?
- Go, go.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:31.796
You are really crazy.
There's nothing there. Now come on.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:33.256
Come on.

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:35.928
All right, let's get down to business.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.306
I want you to stay here
and I want you <i>to...</i>

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:41.309
Oh, my, what a merry feast.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:44.562
- It looks like a beer commercial.
- Let's go in.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.686
Don't vex me, Frank,

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.068
or I'll fix your mouth
so it won't hold soap!

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:55.441
A Christmas party.
I'm so glad I wore my pretty dress.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:58.986
"On The Addams Family, what
musical instrument did Lurch play?"

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:04.034
On The <i>Addams</i> Family,
what musical instrument did Lurch play?

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.952
- Piano.
- I may be invisible but I'm not deaf!

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.963
- OK, OK, we're gonna say piano.
- It was the piano.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.373
- Harpsichord.
- Harpsichord.

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.167
A harpsichord, James, you dope.

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:15.802
- Oh, you knew that.
- Everybody knows that.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:17.963
It's their house.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.257
We better give it to them or else
they'll have us hanging Sheetrock.

01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:23.223
You shouldn't have given that to them.
I wouldn't have given that to them.

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:24.807
- Give it to them.
- James,

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.972
you forgot to
open your brother's present.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.562
That doesn't look like a towel.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.022
What did he get for last year?

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.028
- I don't remember.
- I remember.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.563
A shower curtain!

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:37.529
It was a beautiful shower curtain.
It was gray with these IBC logos.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.864
It had little... Yeah!

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:42.075
- You don't have one.
- Well, what did you get him this year?

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.035
Oh, nothing.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.747
I made this picture frame.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.541
He made it with his own little hands.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:52.630
How sweet.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.256
I know something you don't know.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:57.135
I know something you don't know.
I know something you don't know.

01:06:57.305 --> 01:06:58.545
Shut up!

01:06:58.723 --> 01:06:59.713
Jackpot

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:04.722
It's your basic
top-of-the-line Pioneer VCR.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.804
- I think he made a mistake.
- This ought to work.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.564
I didn't get the gifts mixed up.

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:12.943
My ex-secretary got the gifts mixed up.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:15.194
You invite him
to Christmas dinner every year

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.481
and every year, he's too busy to come.

01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:19.525
And when are you gonna learn?

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.902
Never. He's my brother.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.287
A <i>toast...</i>

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:27.289
<i>...to</i> my brother Frank.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.701
- I wish he was here.
- Were, goofy.

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:31.787
You're too good.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:34.172
- To Frank.
- To Frank. Cheers!

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.003
The richest man you know.

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:37.633
Keep the VCR.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.593
What the hell.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.675
It's only money.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:46.264
- It's a write-off. It's tax-deductible.
- I understand, Frank.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.228
I understand.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:52.850
OK, "What was the name of the boat that
took them all to <i>Gilligan's</i> Island?"

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.107
This is so easy.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.397
<i>The Make.</i>

01:07:58.575 --> 01:07:59.815
You gotta know this.

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.529
- S. S. Mackerel.
- No.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:03.068
- The fish.
- It's a fish.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.736
Let's go now, Frank.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.496
Leave me alone. I know this one.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.998
Everybody knows this one. Let's go now!

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:11.500
Oh, yeah?
Does everybody know this one here?

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:16.256
Oh, Frank, we're fighting again.
Let's not fight anymore!

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:19.589
Oh, look, Frank. What is it?

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:20.877
I can't find the card.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:23.011
It's a toaster!

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.263
The answer is Mackerel.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.937
The bitch hit me with a toaster.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.189
Oh, I love a girl with spirit. Right!

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.026
Well, this is nice.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.979
Where are we, Trump Tower?

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.359
I've seen a little bit of the city.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:44.743
Hey, hey, down here! Hey! Down here!

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:49.031
Hey, you! Hey, Jersey!
Call Streets and Sanitation!

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.158
Wow! Thanks for the shot.

01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:52.497
Hey! Hey!

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.786
Oh, I'm having the weirdest day!

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.375
Cop!

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:59.252
Hey, Cop! Help me, please!

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.397
Herman!

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.479
Herman!

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.734
Coffee's on me. Come here.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.658
Jesus, give me a happy ending here,
Herm. Come on, man.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.997
Herman, it's Dick.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.636
Liz says hi.

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:49.765
Jeez, maybe I should've given you
the two bucks, huh?

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:52.939
Herm.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.317
You moron!

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:01.561
You jerk!

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.108
Why didn't you stay at Claire's?
Why didn't you stay with Claire?

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:07.616
She would have taken care of you!

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.653
You would have eaten!
You would have been warm!

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:11.321
You might be alive!

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:14.241
You'd be a prettier color,
I'll tell you that!

01:10:17.672 --> 01:10:20.414
OK, is there a way
to get out of here, Herman?

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.348
It's the door, isn't it?

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.396
It is the door, isn't it?

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.641
It's the door!

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.936
It had to be the door

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:46.323
'cause it's the only place
that doesn't smell like urine!

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:54.243
Oh, shit!

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.116
What's going on up there?

01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.001
Paul, where are you, kid? I need you.

01:10:58.171 --> 01:10:59.252
Jesus Christ, hang on a second.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:02.460
Hey, you! Joker!
Hey, get off the set, will you?

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:04.670
- Hew
- Yeah, we see you, pal.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.334
Get off the set!

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:09.171
- Oh, my God!
- It's Mr. Cross!

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.557
Hey, Frank, we've been looking
all over for you, buddy.

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.684
Frank. Come on, Frank.
Frank, Frank.

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:15.969
I was worried about you.

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:17.137
Just like Errol Flynn, huh?

01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:18.897
- No, he's OK.
- Very funny.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.854
Come on. You go upstairs to your office.
Kind of supervise things.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:23.644
You can check up
the satellite linkups, huh?

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.903
- Brice, we got three minutes till air.
- I know how much time we got.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:28.861
I just want to say,
break a leg, everybody.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:30.991
I feel real weird about tonight.

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:34.450
Yeah, do you hear that, folks? OK,
this one's for Frank. This is his baby.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.160
Come on, come OH, come on.

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:38.450
Don't lose it on me, huh? Come on.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:42.667
You know, it has been such an honor
to work for the great Frank Cross.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.832
I'm gonna dine out on this for months.
You know what I'm saying?

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.876
Now I want Grace
to take you upstairs now

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:51.046
where I think things mightjust be
a little safer than down here. OK?

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:54.307
You're beautiful, Frank.
Got any last tips for me, huh?

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.939
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Grace, go watch the show.

01:12:01.108 --> 01:12:03.566
He's here for me! Come on!
All right, come on! Give it to me!

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:06.819
You think I'm afraid of you,
the day I've had?

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:11.233
I know what you came for.
Come and get it, you pussy.

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:14.072
- Brice!
- Stop scaring Frank.

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:16.533
- Get this nutcake out of here.
- Who is that guy?

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:18.289
- Oh, Jesus.
- We got a show to do.

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:22.248
He's in the show, Mr. Cross,
as the Ghost of Christmas Future.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:25.918
He's great.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.504
That guy is gonna be a big star.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.295
All right, go watch the show.
We're making history tonight, I think.

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:33.509
<i>OK, video...</i>

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.549
Five seconds till we open on B.

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.637
- Then we go live.
- Right.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:46.393
God bless us, every one!

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.112
Tonight, live on IBC,

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:55.653
the world premiere telecast
of a Christmas classic,

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.071
Charles Dickens' immortal Scrooge.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.340
- Ready to roll B.
- B on the bell tower.

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:15.676
- Don't screw <i>up...</i>
- Roll tape B.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:16.931
Hold there, three.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:19.805
All right, coming up on three.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.141
Three, two, one. Dissolve it.

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:23.931
- And dancing.
- Right where you are.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:27.226
Slow pullout on three.
Slow pullout on three.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.815
Down on Houseman, lights up.
Ready, mic him in.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:33.323
It was a cold, bleak Christmas Eve.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.984
<i>The fog-draped streets of London...</i>

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:38.740
Oh, you've got Houseman.
I think he's wonderful.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:40.872
- Give me the beer.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.666
<i>...a phantom through the dingy mist.</i>

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.165
<i>Old Ebenezer Scrooge,</i>

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:49.206
<i>alone in his gloomy chambers...</i>

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.420
We'll make that move as soon as
we get off of Houseman.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.631
Corning to camera three live.
Dissolve three.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:57.968
<i>- What have we here?
- They're dormice, Uncle.</i>

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.892
<i>Dormice? Dormice?</i>

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:02.473
You see? Works like a charm.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.229
<i>- What do they do?
- They bring you luck.</i>

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:05.559
<i>Are you lucky?</i>

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:09.317
<i>Sir, I believe I am.
I've got your niece for my wife.</i>

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:12.195
<i>I've got a good job,
and it's the holidays, sir.</i>

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:14.193
<i>Holiday, is it?</i>

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:16.991
<i>You have my niece for a wife all right.</i>

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:20.495
<i>Do you have my job too?
That's the luck.</i>

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:25.325
"To Frank,
the best brother a guy ever had.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.544
Merry Christmas."

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:33.337
<i>When the snow lay round about</i>

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:35.468
<i>Deep and crisp and even</i>

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.426
<i>Brightly shone the moon that night</i>

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:41.053
<i>Though the frost was cruel</i>

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.594
<i>When a poor man came in sight</i>

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:47.730
<i>Gathering winter fuel</i>

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:51.560
This is indeed a night for revelation.

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:54.654
Thank you for showing me
the true meaning.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.735
Thank me not, Ebenezer,

01:14:56.909 --> 01:15:00.994
for soon you shall be visited
by the final spirit.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:05.122
<i>The thing that all men fear the most.</i>

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:07.829
<i>The Ghost of Christmas Future.</i>

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:09.751
<i>Oh, thank you, sir.</i>

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.797
<i>I'll be so good. I'll repent.</i>

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.449
Honey, I'm home!

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:41.943
- Oh, boy!
- Remember rne, boss?

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:44.783
The guy you canned
the day before Christmas?

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:47.126
Merry Christmas!

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:50.004
Hello, wabbit.

01:15:50.838 --> 01:15:52.078
Would you give me a running start?

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:56.591
Sure. 1,001, 1,002, 1,003.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.387
My God! My babies!

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:11.139
<i>Oh, you better watch out</i>

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.729
Can't you get back to me on this
after the holidays?

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:15.064
I've had a bad day.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.228
You've had a bad day?

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:21.525
Let me tell you a little bit about
my day! I got fired! My wife left me!

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.449
She took our little baby daughter...

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.405
...with her.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:33.287
I can't recall much after that
because ever since then, I've been

01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:36.957
blind, stinking drunk!

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:41.840
<i>He sees you when you're sleeping</i>

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:43.596
You gotta believe rne, Eliot!

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:46.383
I'm having a much worse day
than you are!

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.721
Much worse! Really!

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:51.812
<i>He knows if you've been bad</i>

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.443
<i>So be good, for goodness' sake</i>

01:16:57.613 --> 01:17:00.696
<i>Oh, he's making a list</i>

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.903
<i>He's checking it twice</i>

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:05.159
<i>Gonna find out</i>

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:07.491
<i>Who's naughty or nice</i>

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.533
<i>Santa Claus is coming</i>

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:13.910
<i>To town</i>

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.591
It's you. Creep.

01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:26.426
God. Aren't you supposed to be
in the studio? We're on the air.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.011
Hey, back off, big man.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.426
That may work with the chicks
but not with me.

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:32.311
Is this straight?

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.102
May I'_>

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:48.407
Did our people do that?

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.072
We're gonna get phone calls.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.022
Visiting hours are over, Mrs. Cooley.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:21.853
- I just got here.
- I know but we have to go.

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:27.025
Merry Christmas, Calvin.

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:32.784
I'll see you.

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:47.091
Now, this is just possible future,
right? I mean, this is doable.

01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:49.676
I know the head of pediatrics at NYU.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.887
We can get this kid out of here
right away.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:53.142
This is not a problem.

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:55.019
I'm all over this. Don't worry about it!

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.355
Will you look at that?

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:08.233
Where did they come from?

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.071
Hey, you! Beat it!

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.407
- Please.
- Please.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.162
- Gilles.
- Madame?

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.323
Will you look at that?
Look at those filthy little creatures.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:18.334
<i>- Immédiatement.
- Oh, Claire! Claire!</i>

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:22.042
Claire! Claire!
Claire, they're just children.

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:25.208
Please, darling, don't tell me.

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:31.215
I wasted 2O years of my life
on pathetic little creatures like those.

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:34.972
Finally, thank God,
a friend of mine said to rne,

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.680
"Scrape them off, Claire.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.643
You wanna save somebody,

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.896
save yourself."

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.896
I'm sorry, Claire.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.273
Thanks a lot, Lumpy.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.872
That was a lousy thing to do.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.666
Disneyland?

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:32.525
Wendie!

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:35.486
Oh, no.

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:38.489
James, my brother.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.038
He's dead.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:44.044
Why did this have to happen?

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:50.797
Well, when I get back I'm gonna...

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:53.671
Well, there he is! James!

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.509
Who's in there?

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.803
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:03.143
He maketh rne lie down
in green pastures.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:07.106
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake."

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.272
What the hell
is this that you're saying?

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.110
What? That I've died?

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:21.328
Why are you showing rne this stuff?
I can't do anything dead!

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:24.290
Why the hell did you bother
to show me this stuff'?

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:26.798
James, help me.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.091
No. Oh, no.

01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:33.298
Please don't let them burn me, James.

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:38.516
Jimmy, don't let them burn me!
Please don't let them burn me!

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.681
I'm in here! Oh, God!

01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:44.309
Don't let them do it!

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:48.309
Don't let them do it!
Don't let them! I'm in here!

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:50.941
MQfn!

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:54.945
God, I want to live! I want to live!

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:58.657
Oh, God, I wanna live! Help!

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:00.829
I wanna live!

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.119
I wanna live!

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:05.414
I'm alive!

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:06.748
<i>Hallelujah</i>

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.038
Holy shit, what a break!

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.093
I'm at work!

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.463
Oh, God, it's the sun!

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.844
I never thought
that I'd see the sun again!

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:18.096
- I'm alive!
- Not for long.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.553
Milkman!

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:24.182
I'm the Woodstock baby!

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.097
I'm gonna start with you.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.695
You're one of my favorites. Come here!

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:32.775
<i>I'm alive and so are you</i>

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.901
You glad to see me,
or is this a shotgun in your pocket'?

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:40.448
OK. You've heard it. Come on.

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:42.996
Great!

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:47.334
- Don't hurt me.
- We're alive! Pink side! Corning back!

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:48.835
Long sole!

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.371
You know this one?

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:53.924
That's my thing.
I'm going to be doing this to everybody.

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:55.926
All right, here's the deal.

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:58.887
I'll hire you back
at twice your original salary.

01:22:59.558 --> 01:23:01.424
I'll make you my vice president
in charge of programming

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.184
and I'll give you an office up here.

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:06.061
- Would you like my office?
- No, I don't like your office.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.223
That's so you!

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:10.903
What's the catch?

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:14.232
The catch is that
you gotta take a shower, little man.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.272
You are ripe, whoa!

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.906
There's a problem here.

01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:21.660
I was looking
for a Francis Xavier Cross.

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:24.288
That's me, but the great thing is,

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:26.165
it's not me!

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:30.044
The Jews taught me this great word,
schmuck.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.709
I was a schmuck. And now...

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:35.090
...I'm not a schmuck.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.632
Wait a minute! What time is it?

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.764
- Somebody stole my watch.
- It's a quarter to.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.268
We didn't miss it! We didn't miss it!

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:46.723
- We didn't miss what?
- Christmas.

01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:48.228
Merry Christmas!

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.356
Are you alone in there?

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:53.689
We're gonna have some fun.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.854
You and I are going to have some fun
for once in this life.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:59.148
Loudermilk and Cross together!

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:03.278
My, what a glorious day.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:05.742
There has never been such a day.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:08.457
Say, there! You lad.

01:24:08.627 --> 01:24:10.834
Yes, sir? Are you talking to me?

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.745
And take three.

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:14.209
Yes, indeed!

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:16.089
Buy me a goose.

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:19.135
The biggest goose in all of London.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.966
Camera three,
follow the coin all the way down.

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:24.928
Oh, I got it!

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:27.347
Holy shit, that's Frank Cross!

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.011
- He's drunk!
- He's nuts!

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:30.888
He's finished.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:33.724
Shut up!

01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:36.644
Don't touch that dial and stay on him.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:38.195
- What's your name, son?
- Mike.

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:39.855
Mike, say hello
to your folks, will you?

01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:41.023
Hi.

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:43.579
Mike is doing a great job here
for us tonight. Thank you.

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.861
- That's Frank Cross.
- <i>I am...</i>

01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:49.122
- Is he supposed to be in the show?
- What in the...

01:24:49.293 --> 01:24:51.330
Good evening and Merry Christmas.

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.494
With me in the booth
is Eliot Loudermilk.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:55.913
- Eliot, how are we doing up there?
- Open his mic.

01:24:57.217 --> 01:25:00.255
Wonderful! But I don't think
you're gonna be president tomorrow.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:04.509
At least I am
the president of the network tonight.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.014
<i>Tomorrow morning I may not be.</i>

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:09.222
You can bet
your Aunt Suzy's ash can on that!

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:13.890
<i>So, what are you doing
watching television on Christmas Eve?</i>

01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:16.354
They're paying your salary, you ass!

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:19.441
And what kind of a rat bastard idiot

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:22.778
would schedule a live show
on a Christmas Eve?

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.282
Only you, Frank.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:28.780
You know, a week ago, I'd have kicked
your butt right out of the building.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:32.120
But you know something?
He's absolutely right.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:36.663
You are looking at a guy
who told someone today

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:40.166
to staple antlers to a mouse's head

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:41.880
to further my career.

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.716
How many of you people
have got the brass cojones

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:46.176
to try something like that?

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.349
Follow him. Follow him. Stay with him.

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:51.101
I don't know where he's going.

01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:54.684
All of these people, I'm sure they
have incredible families. But I have...

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.270
Look, I got a great brother.
Look at this guy here.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:59.606
My brother, James.
Look how cute he was back then.

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:02.403
<i>He's lots bigger now.</i>

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:04.360
And look at me with the ears,

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.696
the taxi driving down the street
with the doors open.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.235
Thank God my hair grew in, huh?

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:09.790
Not yet.

01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:12.243
<i>I got this for Christmas today from him.</i>

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.124
<i>I gave him a towel.</i>

01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:16.960
<i>The VCR is from Grace, James.</i>

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:22.087
You were right about everything, OK?

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:24.965
<i>Except...</i>

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:28.968
the S. S. Minnow, James.

01:26:29.142 --> 01:26:32.009
What was the ship that brought them all
to Gilligan's Island?

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.518
The S. S. Minnow.

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:36.263
<i>No points this round, James.</i>

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:37.598
- Shit.
- What?

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.484
- Wait a minute.
- How did he know we were playing that?

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:41.860
<i>Hello, Wendie.</i>

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:49.489
Hello, control room!
How can I help you?

01:26:49.663 --> 01:26:51.028
This is Rhinelander.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.324
I want to talk to the idiot
who put that moron on the air.

01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:57.076
Brice Cummings is the idiot, sir.

01:26:57.254 --> 01:27:00.622
But he can't talk to you right now
'cause he's tied up.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:06.712
Yes, in fact, he just said that
you were a flatulating butthead.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.003
A butthead?

01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:10.388
He said he never felt that way
about a man before

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.926
but he really liked you
in a certain way...

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.770
Whoa, I dropped her! Just kidding.
She's a doll. It's OK.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:25.275
It's all right. It's a party.
Come on, it's Christmas Eve!

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:26.814
Lighten up a little bit.

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:30.030
Billy, we are gonna need champagne
for 250 people.

01:27:30.203 --> 01:27:32.991
And please send the stuff
that you send to me.

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:34.997
Don't send the stuff
that I send to other people.

01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:37.909
You know, it's not too late
on Christmas Eve to have fun.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.123
<i>You can call people
that you haven't seen.</i>

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:41.628
<i>You can call a college roommate,</i>

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:43.789
<i>you can call, you know,
an old army buddy.</i>

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:45.173
Keep that tape rolling.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:46.504
<i>You can call your personal banker.</i>

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:50.929
Hey! I don't hear any partying
in that booth, Eliot!

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.260
Great!

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:55.976
You heard him! Party!

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:57.557
Now, why wasn't I invited?

01:27:57.731 --> 01:28:00.769
Now that was just an innocent window,
and you saw what I did to that.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:02.736
You know who you're dealing with?

01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:06.191
I mean, it's a night.
You've got to party hearty, Marty.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:08.822
Look at this. Check this out.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:11.279
Don't be so mean.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:14.365
Look at this. There's a rule.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:18.874
There's a tradition that says
I have to kiss this girl on the lips.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:21.243
Well, she's just upholding the law.

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:24.539
It's a federal law actually,
it's not just a state thing.

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:28.755
Great, Frankie!

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:34.181
- All right!
- I love it!

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:35.716
- Right on, Frank.
- Way to go.

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:38.101
Here, Mr. Cummings.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.187
Boy, that was very good.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:42.898
But you know what?

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.854
It wasn't great.

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.360
There has only been one great.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:52.692
<i>There is a girl
that I wish I were with tonight.</i>

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:55.702
<i>It's a girl
that I loved a long time ago.</i>

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.657
<i>A girl that I still love.</i>

01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:03.494
It's Christmas Eve.
It's not too late, is it?

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.922
<i>Claire, do you remember?</i>

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:09.834
<i>Remember the Kama Sutra, page 19?</i>

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.877
Legs around like this,
then this thing here.

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:15.047
You circle me chanting,
burning incense, before we begin.

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:18.425
<i>Remember I said it ain't possible?</i>

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:20.981
Tonight I think we could do this without

01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:24.390
serious physical
or psychological damage.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.278
Taxi!

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.438
Can you get me to the IBC building
in three minutes'?

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:33.072
Which floor?

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:36.782
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la la la</i>

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:39.947
<i>Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la la la la la</i>

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.163
<i>Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la la la la</i>

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:46.954
<i>Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta</i>

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:53.128
<i>Fa la la la la la la la la</i>

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.427
We should be taping this.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.732
<i>Now, how did that happen?</i>

01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:06.732
<i>That happened because
it's Christmas Eve. I'm telling you!</i>

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:08.358
I'm not crazy.

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:09.977
It's Christmas Eve!

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:13.648
It's the one night of the year
when we all act a little nicer,

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:16.237
we smile a little easier,

01:30:17.621 --> 01:30:19.032
we cheer a little more.

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:22.080
For a couple of hours
out of the whole year,

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:25.834
we are the people
that we always hoped we would be.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.496
It's a miracle.

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:30.459
It's really a sort of a miracle

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:32.921
because it happens
every Christmas Eve.

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:36.512
And if you waste that miracle,
you're gonna burn for it.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.592
<i>I know what I'm talking about.</i>

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:41.475
You have to do something.
You have to take a chance.

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:43.056
You do have to get involved.

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:46.563
There are people that are having trouble
making their miracle happen.

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:48.440
There are people
that don't have enough to eat.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:49.771
There are people that are cold.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:52.232
You can go out and say hello
to these people.

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:55.318
You can take an old blanket
out of the closet and say, "Here."

01:30:55.492 --> 01:30:58.154
You can make them a sandwich
and say, "Oh, by the way, here."

01:30:58.328 --> 01:31:00.285
<i>I get it now!</i>

01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:02.659
<i>And if you give,</i>

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:06.576
then it can happen.
Then the miracle can happen to you!

01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:08.664
It's not just the poor and the hungry,

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:11.045
it's everybody
who's gotta have this miracle!

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:12.957
And it can happen tonight
for all of you!

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:16.343
If you believe in this spirit thing,
the miracle will happen.

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:18.470
And then you'll want it
to happen again tomorrow.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.051
You won't be one of these bastards
who says,

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:23.217
"Christmas is once a year,
it's a fraud." It's not!

01:31:23.395 --> 01:31:26.638
It can happen every day!
You've just gotta want that feeling!

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:30.149
And if you like it and you want it,
you'll get greedy for it!

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:34.186
You'll want it every day of your life,
and it can happen to you!

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:36.446
I believe in it now!

01:31:36.616 --> 01:31:39.904
I believe it's gonna happen to me now!
I'm ready for it!

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:44.079
And it's great. It's a good feeling.

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:47.742
It's really better than
I've felt in a long time.

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:51.503
<i>I'm ready.</i>

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:55.040
<i>Have a merry Christmas, everybody.</i>

01:31:58.763 --> 01:31:59.969
You guys see Calvin?

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.923
Did I forget something, big man?

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.435
God bless us, every one.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.551
Oh, no.

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:44.090
Lumpy. Lump)!-

01:32:44.267 --> 01:32:45.302
Lumpy, no.

01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:49.932
You're like boating a marlin.

01:32:51.858 --> 01:32:54.896
Claire, the whole world.
Whole world, Claire.

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:03.032
And they lived happily ever after.

01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:12.417
<i>Think of your fellow man</i>

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.123
<i>Lend him a helping hand</i>

01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:17.380
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:20.504
<i>You see, it's getting late</i>

01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:22.589
<i>Oh, please don't hesitate</i>

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:25.847
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:30.011
<i>And the world will be a better place</i>

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:34.227
<i>And the world will be a better place</i>

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.768
<i>For you and me</i>

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.613
<i>You just wait and see</i>

01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:45.033
<i>Another day goes by</i>

01:33:45.203 --> 01:33:47.114
<i>And still the children cry</i>

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:50.201
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:51.865
<i>And the world</i>

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:53.283
Stand up! Stand up!

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:54.542
<i>Will be a better place</i>

01:33:54.712 --> 01:33:58.296
<i>And the world will be a better place</i>

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:02.050
<i>For you and me</i>

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:07.514
<i>Just you wait and see</i>

01:34:07.684 --> 01:34:09.595
<i>Another day goes by</i>

01:34:09.769 --> 01:34:11.635
<i>And still the children cry</i>

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:14.726
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:18.442
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:22.987
<i>Put a little love in your heart</i>

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:26.783
<i>Feed me, Seymour. Feed me.</i>

01:34:27.579 --> 01:34:30.241
Come on. Let's hear it
from all you folks out there. Come on.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:32.577
You don't know the words, come on.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:37.374
Come on, let's hear it from this side
of the theater. Come on, just over here.

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:39.833
All right, that's no good.

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.375
Come on, let's try the other side
of the theater. Come on.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:47.675
All right, how aboutjust the men?
Come on, just the men.

01:34:48.474 --> 01:34:51.262
All right, the real men,
let's hear the real men.

01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:55.979
All right, all right, the women.
The women now, this time.

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:59.645
No, the real women. The real women.

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:01.314
You know who you are.

01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:04.900
All right, you, who was making
all the noise through the whole movie.

01:35:05.074 --> 01:35:07.657
My brother, the king of Christmas.
