00:43.126 --> 00:46.254
<i>Gelato being served</i>
<i>in the middle of the street? No.</i>

00:46.963 --> 00:48.965
If tourists want that kind of gelato,

00:49.048 --> 00:50.925
it's best for them to have it.

00:52.343 --> 00:56.097
<i>What we make at Caffè Sicilia</i>
<i>is completely different.</i>

00:56.681 --> 00:59.517
<i>I spend a lot of time</i>
<i>finding quality ingredients</i>

00:59.601 --> 01:03.855
<i>to make it with more flavor,</i>
<i>more aroma, more intensity.</i>

01:09.611 --> 01:10.862
<i>It's soft.</i>

01:11.279 --> 01:12.489
<i>It’s creamy.</i>

01:12.572 --> 01:15.033
<i>The customers always want more.</i>

01:27.086 --> 01:30.048
<i>It's not a special thing</i>
<i>to produce quality.</i>

01:30.465 --> 01:32.050
It's what we know how to do.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.286
The good that Caffè Sicilia has done,

04:05.370 --> 04:08.331
not just for Sicily,
but for the whole of Italy,

04:08.414 --> 04:09.832
is incredible.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.462
<i>But he is not very well-known</i>

04:14.545 --> 04:17.298
<i>because he does not care</i>
<i>about the spotlight.</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:19.217
Instead, he promotes artisans.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.551
He promotes ingredients.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.803
He promotes territory.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.856
Do you want chocolate and lemon
or just lemon?

05:15.606 --> 05:17.817
Chocolate and lemon.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.949
Here it is.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.826
What do we say?

05:26.909 --> 05:28.536
Thank you.

05:28.619 --> 05:34.292
<i>The passing of one generation to the next</i>
<i>is a part of Caffè Sicilia's history.</i>

05:34.876 --> 05:39.881
<i>We have clients</i>
<i>who first came in a stroller,</i>

05:40.465 --> 05:44.052
<i>who today are parents or grandparents,</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:47.055
bringing their own kids or grandkids.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.390
Can I have another?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.975
No, honey, or you're gonna burst.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.520
<i>You can sweep away tradition</i>
<i>in a short period of time,</i>

05:54.604 --> 05:56.898
<i>and substitute it with something else.</i>

05:56.981 --> 05:58.649
<i>I can't do that.</i>

06:02.737 --> 06:05.782
<i>I have deep roots here in Sicily,</i>

06:05.865 --> 06:09.535
<i>my land where I live and work.</i>

06:20.379 --> 06:22.423
<i>The clear air,</i>

06:23.549 --> 06:25.551
<i>the blue sky,</i>

06:26.594 --> 06:30.181
<i>the strong yellow of the wild dried herbs.</i>

06:31.099 --> 06:34.060
<i>The light, the sounds, the colors...</i>

06:35.061 --> 06:41.317
<i>a spectacular landscape that produces</i>
<i>the best ingredients in the world.</i>

06:48.324 --> 06:51.285
<i>It inspires me to create from nature, </i>

06:51.869 --> 06:55.998
<i>to understand what is good</i>
<i>and can be transformed into food.</i>

06:57.542 --> 07:00.419
<i>This is how you build a recipe.</i>

07:06.801 --> 07:11.347
<i>I want to protect and share our culture,</i>

07:11.431 --> 07:13.808
<i>to honor our traditions.</i>

07:19.313 --> 07:22.525
<i>In every expression of our work,</i>

07:22.608 --> 07:28.656
<i>bringing to the world a perspective</i>
<i>that belongs to this land.</i>

07:45.798 --> 07:49.218
Here is your tomato-strawberry granita
with brioche.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.379
<i>Granita is a sweet dish,</i>

08:25.463 --> 08:29.759
<i>made of flavored ice, like a sorbet.</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:38.643
<i>Almost all Sicilians eat</i>
<i>granita and brioche for breakfast.</i>

08:39.727 --> 08:43.314
<i>And there are two different</i>
<i>groups of people: </i>

08:43.397 --> 08:46.317
<i>those who eat almond every morning,</i>

08:46.400 --> 08:48.986
<i>and those who eat lemon every morning.</i>

08:49.070 --> 08:50.696
And they don't change.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.494
<i>I prefer the almond.</i>

08:57.995 --> 09:03.376
<i>This is the place where we grow</i>
<i>the best almonds in the world.</i>

09:08.339 --> 09:11.717
<i>We use the entire almond</i>
<i>to make the granita,</i>

09:11.801 --> 09:14.512
<i>and you taste the difference.</i>

09:15.388 --> 09:17.265
<i>The richness of taste,</i>

09:17.348 --> 09:19.350
<i>the notes of sweetness,</i>

09:19.433 --> 09:23.729
it's the touch of something
which refreshes your palate,

09:23.813 --> 09:25.856
but simultaneously refreshes your mind.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.122
<i>As a kid, Sicily was my paradise.</i>

10:26.250 --> 10:29.128
<i>I grew up in the countryside, in Noto.</i>

10:31.339 --> 10:34.634
<i>My aunt managed Caffè Sicilia.</i>

10:35.134 --> 10:37.136
<i>Every day after school,</i>

10:37.219 --> 10:39.472
I'd go meet my aunt in the store.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.894
<i>We'd eat almond granita</i>

10:44.977 --> 10:48.898
<i>and shortbread cookies with apricot jam.</i>

10:50.608 --> 10:54.070
I'd eat too many.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.244
<i>We had a small citrus orchard</i>
<i>that my father planted.</i>

11:03.788 --> 11:08.167
<i>During the summer,</i>
<i>Dad picked fruit in the morning.</i>

11:08.250 --> 11:12.421
<i>Then we would all get in the car</i>
<i>and drive to the ocean.</i>

11:20.012 --> 11:23.933
<i>When we finished swimming</i>
<i>in the salt water,</i>

11:24.016 --> 11:28.646
<i>we would refresh ourselves</i>
<i>with fruit picked that morning.</i>

11:32.483 --> 11:35.403
<i>Sea water and just-picked fruit.</i>

11:39.990 --> 11:42.910
<i>Very fresh, flavorful, good...</i>

11:42.993 --> 11:45.246
<i>very simple.</i>

11:46.914 --> 11:52.211
<i>I learned to appreciate</i>
<i>the simplicity of our land.</i>

12:08.853 --> 12:13.983
<i>Caffè Sicilia was important</i>
<i>to the village, a landmark for many.</i>

12:14.525 --> 12:18.779
<i>It has been passed down in my family</i>
<i>for four generations.</i>

12:19.405 --> 12:24.869
But the laboratory was entrusted to
the only pastry chef not from the family,

12:25.327 --> 12:26.746
Mr. Roberto Giusto.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.583
<i>He lived to work</i>

12:30.666 --> 12:33.627
<i>and was recognized as important</i>
<i>by the whole town.</i>

12:46.098 --> 12:49.935
<i>I'd play in the laboratory</i>
<i>with Maestro Roberto.</i>

12:50.811 --> 12:52.855
<i>For me, it was a playground.</i>

12:55.524 --> 13:00.571
<i>Roberto would give me little chores</i>
<i>like in a house, like in a family:</i>

13:01.405 --> 13:03.949
<i>bringing a kilo of flour,</i>

13:04.033 --> 13:07.244
<i>bringing the almonds,</i>
<i>bringing the honey vase...</i>

13:09.538 --> 13:15.544
<i>He started to teach me about life</i>
<i>in Noto and at Caffè Sicilia.</i>

13:22.718 --> 13:29.433
<i>He said the work of the pastry chef is</i>
<i>to make the classic Italian pastries.</i>

13:34.230 --> 13:38.234
<i>But it isn't enough to know</i>
<i>kitchen techniques.</i>

13:41.612 --> 13:45.074
<i>You have to recognize</i>
<i>raw materials in nature</i>

13:45.157 --> 13:47.117
<i>and respect the land.</i>

13:51.372 --> 13:55.167
<i>The customers must be able</i>
<i>to see the ingredient's quality</i>

13:55.251 --> 13:58.087
when they taste our pastries.

14:04.260 --> 14:10.140
<i>The laboratory was the place</i>
<i>where I felt most like myself.</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:11.934
<i>It was my home.</i>

14:32.621 --> 14:35.499
What do we have to do
for Gennaro Esposito?

14:35.583 --> 14:38.502
We have to make four 1.5 kilo cassata,

14:38.586 --> 14:41.589
150 arancini, 120 cannoli,

14:41.672 --> 14:45.175
120 almond biscuits.
There's almond paste...

14:46.051 --> 14:48.637
20 30-gram ones...

14:48.721 --> 14:52.433
and we have to bring the arancini
to Catania to fry them.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.695
<i>The cannoli is the Sicilian pastry.</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:08.240
They were born in Sicily,
and the world knows them as Sicilian.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.085
<i>The dough preparation,</i>

15:20.169 --> 15:22.546
<i>one by one, all by hand,</i>

15:22.630 --> 15:24.506
<i>all consistently equal.</i>

15:26.717 --> 15:31.055
<i>You must be accurate, fast,</i>
<i>to make it perfect.</i>

15:38.520 --> 15:42.107
<i>I learned from the lessons</i>
<i>of Maestro Roberto,</i>

15:42.733 --> 15:45.569
<i>and I passed it down to my son, Francesco.</i>

15:48.614 --> 15:52.201
<i>As a boy, he used to come to our kitchen,</i>

15:52.284 --> 15:55.955
and, with a rolling pin,
started flattening the cannoli dough,

15:56.830 --> 15:59.166
<i>covering himself with flour.</i>

16:00.459 --> 16:05.214
<i>Now, when he works with me,</i>
<i>he no longer covers himself with flour,</i>

16:05.297 --> 16:07.508
but he still flattens the cannoli.

16:19.436 --> 16:23.732
<i>We've made our cannoli for generations.</i>

16:28.904 --> 16:33.534
<i>You can recognize the cannolo</i>
<i>stretched out by each of us,</i>

16:36.996 --> 16:41.083
<i>adding our own personality</i>
<i>with our rolling pins, </i>

16:43.293 --> 16:45.337
<i>so that, when the cannolo is finished,</i>

16:45.421 --> 16:48.799
it becomes the unmistakable icon
of Caffè Sicilia.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.908
<i>I had spent years of my childhood</i>
<i>in the laboratory</i>

17:14.992 --> 17:17.494
<i>with my teacher, Roberto Giusto.</i>

17:19.496 --> 17:21.957
<i>And then I grew up.</i>

17:23.959 --> 17:26.086
<i>I'm a child of the '60s</i>

17:26.170 --> 17:30.466
<i>and was influenced</i>
<i>by everything happening around me.</i>

17:32.634 --> 17:38.390
<i>I wanted to discover the world,</i>
<i>to learn more than I could in Sicily.</i>

17:39.933 --> 17:41.769
<i>I liked the farmer's life,</i>

17:41.852 --> 17:44.646
<i>so when I was 17,</i>

17:44.730 --> 17:50.652
<i>I left Noto to study agriculture</i>
<i>in Bologna at the university.</i>

17:57.576 --> 18:01.038
<i>My new adventure allowed me to grow,</i>

18:01.121 --> 18:05.292
<i>to observe the world</i>
<i>from another point of view.</i>

18:07.961 --> 18:11.340
<i>I studied with a great beekeeper,</i>

18:11.423 --> 18:16.595
<i>who gave me my first lessons</i>
<i>on decoding the language of the bees.</i>

18:24.436 --> 18:27.648
<i>We observed the intensity</i>
<i>of the bees' dance.</i>

18:27.731 --> 18:31.235
<i>The more bees move their back,</i>

18:31.318 --> 18:37.032
<i>the closer, the more intense,</i>
<i>the stronger the nectar is.</i>

18:38.242 --> 18:39.785
<i>I was fascinated.</i>

18:41.328 --> 18:43.956
<i>It became my great passion.</i>

18:56.051 --> 19:01.265
<i>During that time, I fell in love</i>
<i>with a nurse, Nives.</i>

19:04.059 --> 19:07.855
Like me, she grew up in a kitchen.

19:09.606 --> 19:13.318
<i>Together, we built a life in Bologna.</i>

19:20.576 --> 19:23.954
<i>Then, one day, this phone call came.</i>

19:24.913 --> 19:26.623
<i>My aunt was sick</i>

19:26.707 --> 19:31.295
and could no longer keep Caffè Sicilia.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.595
<i>My aunt told me, "I cannot do it anymore.</i>

19:39.678 --> 19:42.681
<i>Either you take care of it,</i>
<i>or we'll lose it."</i>

19:46.643 --> 19:51.023
<i>The first thing I immediately thought was,</i>

19:51.106 --> 19:54.151
"If my aunt sells Caffè Sicilia,

19:54.943 --> 19:58.363
I cannot get in the laboratory.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.785
I will not be able to go
to my playroom anymore."

20:08.081 --> 20:11.501
<i>Nives and I discussed, "What do we do?"</i>

20:12.377 --> 20:17.049
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>there were two loves in my life: </i>

20:17.925 --> 20:20.010
<i>my life in Bologna </i>

20:20.093 --> 20:22.387
<i>and my life in Noto.</i>

20:23.639 --> 20:25.432
<i>My roots.</i>

20:31.855 --> 20:34.775
<i>It was a very difficult moment.</i>

20:36.526 --> 20:40.364
<i>Ultimately, we chose the pastry shop.</i>

20:42.574 --> 20:46.620
<i>We left everything and returned home.</i>

21:09.101 --> 21:10.269
There she is.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.440
Here, here.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.359
Careful.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.987
Good girl.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.160
Come here.

21:38.213 --> 21:42.050
<i>To make pastries, you don't need industry.</i>

21:43.135 --> 21:48.598
<i>When purchasing raw materials,</i>
<i>I go directly to the farmers of our land.</i>

21:50.851 --> 21:53.020
<i>There is no quality in the ingredient</i>

21:53.103 --> 21:56.398
<i>if there is no quality in the person</i>
<i>that produces it.</i>

21:58.317 --> 22:04.865
<i>So you need to find farmers</i>
<i>who understand quality in their work.</i>

22:05.949 --> 22:10.078
<i>Franzo, our great shepherd</i>
<i>and ricotta producer,</i>

22:10.162 --> 22:13.582
<i>works from 2:30 a.m. to midnight,</i>

22:15.417 --> 22:20.255
<i>hand milking over 500 animals</i>
<i>to make the ricotta perfect.</i>

22:24.551 --> 22:29.181
<i>Franzo is a person of quality,</i>
<i>extremely serious and rigorous.</i>

22:36.646 --> 22:39.816
<i>But the public doesn't know anything</i>
<i>about his work, </i>

22:39.900 --> 22:42.277
<i>and that's a huge regret for me.</i>

22:51.161 --> 22:53.121
<i>I want him to succeed</i>

22:53.205 --> 22:57.250
<i>in giving a future to his family</i>
<i>and his farm.</i>

22:58.001 --> 23:02.255
<i>So I made my friends appreciate</i>
<i>Franzo's products,</i>

23:02.339 --> 23:04.758
<i>cooks, pizza makers, pastry chefs,</i>

23:04.841 --> 23:07.177
<i>and now they buy his cheeses.</i>

23:07.886 --> 23:10.847
<i>He always thanks me</i>
<i>for what I am doing for him,</i>

23:11.473 --> 23:14.434
but it's me who should
constantly thank him.

23:24.694 --> 23:28.073
<i>The gelato I make with the ricotta,</i>

23:28.156 --> 23:31.993
<i>flavored with rum and chopped pistachios, </i>

23:32.077 --> 23:34.746
<i>would be impossible without Franzo's work.</i>

23:40.544 --> 23:42.087
<i>It's my duty,</i>

23:42.170 --> 23:46.341
if he gives me his perfect ricotta,
to make the perfect gelato.

24:35.891 --> 24:39.477
<i>After seven years,</i>
<i>I was back at Caffè Sicilia.</i>

24:41.062 --> 24:45.358
<i>Even though, as a kid,</i>
<i>I spent a lot of time in the lab,</i>

24:45.942 --> 24:48.945
<i>I didn't really understand</i>
<i>the job of a pastry chef.</i>

24:50.155 --> 24:52.407
And now, I was responsible for everything.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.996
<i>I was lost.</i>

24:58.622 --> 25:00.665
<i>I had questions, many questions.</i>

25:01.666 --> 25:03.835
<i>I turned to Maestro Roberto.</i>

25:05.545 --> 25:09.174
<i>But he told me, "I'm not going to</i>
<i>teach you anything.</i>

25:09.966 --> 25:11.593
<i>This is not school.</i>

25:12.177 --> 25:14.638
<i>This is a place where you work.</i>

25:15.430 --> 25:18.016
You have to be independent."

25:20.769 --> 25:25.732
<i>So I spent my time watching Roberto work.</i>

25:27.817 --> 25:30.195
<i>I learned by looking,</i>

25:31.112 --> 25:34.282
<i>watching his hands making the recipes, </i>

25:35.158 --> 25:37.702
<i>until I was able to start doing it.</i>

25:50.632 --> 25:53.593
<i>Little by little, I was able</i>

25:53.677 --> 25:57.264
to find my way of understanding,
without asking.

26:16.116 --> 26:21.246
<i>Finally,</i>
<i>I felt able to manage the pastry shop.</i>

26:41.641 --> 26:43.727
Do we have to make them all pink?

26:43.810 --> 26:46.521
All pink, like the fuchsia dress...

26:47.856 --> 26:52.235
So I'm making that fuchsia,
with little white flowers.

26:52.319 --> 26:56.239
We'll make the white flowers
with whipped cream spikes,

26:56.323 --> 26:58.491
or maybe we could put sugared almonds...

26:59.242 --> 27:01.828
if they wouldn't melt with the cream,
but they'll melt,

27:02.287 --> 27:04.039
so we're gonna make white cream.

27:06.624 --> 27:09.753
<i>Over time,</i>
<i>it became increasingly difficult</i>

27:09.836 --> 27:12.714
<i>to focus only on the work</i>
<i>inside of the kitchen.</i>

27:25.977 --> 27:28.688
<i>Sicily had become commercialized.</i>

27:28.772 --> 27:31.608
<i>Where there were once vegetable gardens,</i>

27:31.691 --> 27:36.571
those lands were used
to build shopping centers.

27:42.410 --> 27:47.374
<i>Fake cities, where you don't buy fresh.</i>
<i>You buy preserved.</i>

27:47.457 --> 27:50.293
And you call that civilization?

27:51.711 --> 27:53.588
This is ignorance.

27:55.423 --> 27:59.052
<i>I knew there was still quality</i>
<i>everywhere in Sicily.</i>

27:59.636 --> 28:03.598
<i>I needed to make the world understand</i>
<i>the difference</i>

28:03.681 --> 28:08.645
<i>between a commercialized product</i>
<i>and the quality born in this land.</i>

28:10.105 --> 28:13.525
<i>I considered,</i>
<i>"What can we get from our land</i>

28:13.608 --> 28:17.821
<i>that's unique and higher quality</i>
<i>than from elsewhere?"</i>

28:18.738 --> 28:19.948
<i>And I remembered</i>

28:20.031 --> 28:21.699
the apricot.

28:26.496 --> 28:30.208
<i>The apricot is the first jam children eat.</i>

28:31.668 --> 28:34.879
<i>But what they know is</i>
<i>an industrialized product.</i>

28:37.132 --> 28:40.635
<i>We have always made</i>
<i>our marmalade the same way</i>

28:40.719 --> 28:44.180
<i>for 125 years at Caffè Sicilia.</i>

28:44.264 --> 28:47.058
<i>So, I worked on the apricot.</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:52.063
I modernized it, made it current,

28:52.731 --> 28:56.151
<i>reducing the added sugar</i>

28:57.235 --> 29:00.655
<i>to respect the purity of the fresh fruit.</i>

29:05.910 --> 29:09.539
<i>And I began making all</i>
<i>of the other timeless recipes</i>

29:09.622 --> 29:13.001
<i>with the ingredients</i>
<i>I find here in Sicily: </i>

29:14.210 --> 29:16.921
<i>the cassata, the cannoli,</i>
<i>the ricotta gelato.</i>

29:24.929 --> 29:28.266
<i>Now, every time a child</i>
<i>tastes my apricot jam,</i>

29:28.349 --> 29:30.226
<i>I feel joy.</i>

29:30.977 --> 29:34.022
<i>Making my apricot jam</i>
<i>helped me to understand</i>

29:34.105 --> 29:36.816
<i>the foundation of Caffè Sicilia.</i>

29:38.902 --> 29:41.613
<i>I discovered my purpose.</i>

29:56.711 --> 29:58.588
Those Saturn peaches are great.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.590
Can you give me a kilo?

30:15.480 --> 30:18.775
Wait, an apricot. There's another one.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.987
Thanks. Have a nice day. Goodbye.

30:24.697 --> 30:26.491
<i>By the early 2000s,</i>

30:26.574 --> 30:30.578
<i>after years of working</i>
<i>with the same recipes and ingredients,</i>

30:30.662 --> 30:32.080
<i>I wanted to do more.</i>

30:42.549 --> 30:45.218
<i>I was looking to build new flavor,</i>

30:45.718 --> 30:49.931
<i>to push the boundaries</i>
<i>of sweetness in dessert.</i>

30:50.974 --> 30:53.476
And there I saw my granita.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.814
<i>I asked myself,</i>
<i>"What can we serve with it?"</i>

31:05.780 --> 31:08.867
<i>I started thinking about</i>
<i>the feeling of the sea,</i>

31:10.535 --> 31:13.997
<i>the feeling you get</i>
<i>when you open an oyster.</i>

31:18.001 --> 31:19.586
<i>It dawned on me.</i>

31:19.669 --> 31:21.629
<i>Put them together, </i>

31:21.713 --> 31:24.632
<i>the oyster and the almond.</i>

31:24.716 --> 31:28.011
Marry the two that would
otherwise never marry.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.395
<i>It was strong, robust.</i>

31:38.062 --> 31:41.566
<i>I thought it was the perfect balance.</i>

31:45.153 --> 31:48.489
<i>The combination of salt water </i>

31:48.573 --> 31:52.368
<i>and that sweetness,</i>
<i>like biting into fresh fruit.</i>

31:52.869 --> 31:58.291
When all that exploded in my mouth,
I thought, "I have already tasted this."

31:59.792 --> 32:02.211
<i>And memories came back.</i>

32:15.058 --> 32:16.851
<i>It inspired me.</i>

32:17.477 --> 32:21.522
<i>I realized I could use</i>
<i>the taste of my childhood</i>

32:22.231 --> 32:24.651
<i>to create a new sweetness,</i>

32:24.734 --> 32:27.904
<i>something that didn't exist</i>
<i>in pastry making.</i>

32:44.128 --> 32:47.632
So I created more and more,
more and more, more and more.

32:56.391 --> 33:01.562
<i>I started to bring down barriers</i>
<i>between sweet and salty.</i>

33:01.646 --> 33:05.525
This was considered heresy
in Sicilian cuisine.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.705
<i>Our customers didn't like it at all.</i>

33:19.247 --> 33:22.333
<i>They wanted the classics of Caffè Sicilia.</i>

33:28.006 --> 33:30.425
<i>His thoughts are boundless,</i>

33:30.508 --> 33:33.553
but, as is often the case,
no one is a prophet in their own country.

33:37.807 --> 33:41.185
<i>We had lost the trust of the customers.</i>

33:41.978 --> 33:46.482
<i>Four generations of tradition, in trouble.</i>

33:59.871 --> 34:04.459
<i>I'd always had Roberto near</i>
<i>when I didn't know what to do.</i>

34:06.461 --> 34:08.963
<i>But in that moment, he got sick.</i>

34:10.339 --> 34:12.383
<i>He was no longer able to walk</i>

34:12.467 --> 34:15.178
<i>and was not able to come</i>
<i>into Caffè Sicilia.</i>

34:16.637 --> 34:20.099
<i>I couldn't ask for advice</i>
<i>on what he would have done.</i>

34:21.476 --> 34:23.978
And then he passed away.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.988
<i>It was a huge loss.</i>

34:36.032 --> 34:37.742
<i>I was alone.</i>

34:59.680 --> 35:02.934
<i>He left me with a huge responsibility.</i>

35:03.643 --> 35:07.271
I asked myself,
"If Maestro Roberto was here now,

35:07.355 --> 35:08.689
what would he do?"

35:10.483 --> 35:13.027
<i>I thought about what he taught me,</i>

35:13.111 --> 35:17.323
<i>how to make the basic recipes</i>
<i>with quality ingredients.</i>

35:20.243 --> 35:24.497
<i>But the most important ingredient</i>
<i>was at risk.</i>

35:33.756 --> 35:38.761
So, while the Romana almond has become
the most famous almond of our land...

35:38.845 --> 35:40.346
There's very few of them.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.238
Romana, here it is.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.701
<i>I needed to figure out what was happening.</i>

36:02.618 --> 36:04.912
<i>So, I went to the farmers.</i>

36:06.080 --> 36:10.293
<i>They told me that the big problem</i>
<i>was the traders,</i>

36:10.376 --> 36:15.548
who decided the almond was
not worth investing money in.

36:20.428 --> 36:24.724
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>the farmers abandoned the land.</i>

36:26.642 --> 36:28.102
<i>It was a massacre.</i>

36:30.563 --> 36:34.609
<i>Without the almond,</i>
<i>I couldn't make almond granita.</i>

36:35.776 --> 36:39.864
<i>The taste of Caffè Sicilia</i>
<i>was disappearing.</i>

36:41.032 --> 36:43.284
<i>I had to do something.</i>

36:45.036 --> 36:49.123
<i>So I put together a plan</i>
<i>to save the almond.</i>

36:53.085 --> 36:56.505
<i>We would cut out the traders,</i>

36:56.589 --> 37:01.469
<i>so the farmers could sell the almond</i>
<i>directly to us.</i>

37:03.429 --> 37:07.308
We started to spread it among the farmers.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.650
<i>I had to convince them</i>
<i>to fight for the almond</i>

37:16.734 --> 37:19.028
because it's a cultural heritage.

37:19.111 --> 37:22.114
Because if it disappears,
it will never come back.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.913
<i>It was a long and slow process, </i>

37:28.996 --> 37:31.165
<i>but eventually</i>
<i>they wanted to work with us.</i>

37:35.127 --> 37:38.506
<i>We brought it to the taste expo in Milan.</i>

37:39.298 --> 37:41.008
<i>From that moment on,</i>

37:41.092 --> 37:44.011
<i>the world knew of the existence</i>
<i>of our almond.</i>

37:45.137 --> 37:49.475
<i>Then, I went back to the laboratory</i>
<i>to work on a new recipe</i>

37:49.558 --> 37:52.061
<i>to highlight the almond.</i>

37:56.524 --> 37:59.485
<i>The Terra Nostra is made of</i>
<i>two layers of sorbet: </i>

38:00.069 --> 38:03.572
<i>a layer of white almond</i>
<i>and a layer of green pistachio.</i>

38:04.699 --> 38:08.411
<i>It's called the Terra Nostra</i>
<i>because it represents "our land."</i>

38:19.380 --> 38:21.507
<i>Corrado saves Noto's almond,</i>

38:21.590 --> 38:24.760
but also saves traditional
Sicilian pastry making.

38:27.096 --> 38:32.184
<i>If today we talk about the almond,</i>
<i>it's thanks to Corrado.</i>

38:34.812 --> 38:37.648
<i>I rediscovered my purpose,</i>

38:38.399 --> 38:40.818
<i>to preserve my land, my Sicily.</i>

40:17.998 --> 40:20.751
<i>Sicily is changing over time.</i>

40:21.419 --> 40:26.257
<i>Many of the small businesses,</i>
<i>shops, are gone.</i>

40:30.177 --> 40:35.516
<i>But after four generations,</i>
<i>Caffè Sicilia has remained.</i>

40:38.519 --> 40:41.689
<i>It has become a lively stream,</i>

40:41.772 --> 40:44.817
<i>water flowing among rocks, fresh,</i>

40:44.900 --> 40:47.319
<i>that consistently renews itself, </i>

40:47.403 --> 40:50.614
<i>but always flows in the same riverbed.</i>

40:52.450 --> 40:55.202
<i>But now, many years have passed.</i>

40:56.203 --> 41:00.374
<i>I don't want to,</i>
<i>but I need to focus on the future,</i>

41:00.458 --> 41:05.546
<i>where there's a new generation</i>
<i>of pastry chefs, </i>

41:05.629 --> 41:08.549
<i>led by my son, Francesco.</i>

41:15.264 --> 41:17.600
<i>As a child, he worked with me.</i>

41:17.683 --> 41:20.519
<i>Then he left to work in</i>
<i>the kitchen of Le Calandre,</i>

41:20.603 --> 41:23.522
<i>with my friend Massimiliano Alajmo.</i>

41:25.941 --> 41:30.404
<i>But when Massimiliano offered him</i>

41:30.488 --> 41:34.492
<i>a two-year contract,</i>

41:34.575 --> 41:38.662
Francesco said, "Massimiliano,
thank you so much. I'd love to,

41:38.746 --> 41:41.165
but I have to go and help out my dad."

41:41.248 --> 41:42.791
Massimiliano said, "Okay."

41:52.510 --> 41:58.015
<i>It's absolutely natural</i>
<i>that he returned to Noto,</i>

41:58.098 --> 42:01.143
because who better than his father
to teach him

42:01.227 --> 42:03.646
the true essence of what he does.

42:03.729 --> 42:08.067
I believe he can also bring new life
to his father's work.

42:12.738 --> 42:15.908
<i>Like me, he needed to go away</i>
<i>from Noto to choose Noto, </i>

42:15.991 --> 42:19.453
to go away from Caffè Sicilia
to choose Caffè Sicilia.

42:21.247 --> 42:25.543
<i>What concerns me more than before</i>

42:25.626 --> 42:31.882
<i>is leaving him in the best position</i>
<i>to go on his path with his ideas.</i>

43:19.680 --> 43:21.515
Perfect.

43:25.394 --> 43:26.770
We're ready.

43:48.667 --> 43:51.253
<i>I've chosen my path, and I've followed it.</i>

43:53.130 --> 43:55.341
<i>Now, I have no ambition.</i>

43:55.924 --> 43:59.136
<i>A life of simplicity, of quality,</i>

43:59.219 --> 44:05.434
<i>and my family makes me happy</i>
<i>and satisfied.</i>

44:10.939 --> 44:16.028
<i>I sleep well at night</i>
<i>because I give the best of what I can do</i>

44:16.111 --> 44:21.617
<i>to those who come and taste what we make.</i>

44:22.576 --> 44:25.245
<i>So I'm happy, and I can sleep peacefully.</i>
