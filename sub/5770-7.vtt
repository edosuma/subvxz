HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND?

00:03.525 --> 00:04.743
OH, IT WAS GREAT, DR. L.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.919
I WENT TO A SELF-DEFENSE
WORKSHOP AT THE "Y."

00:06.963 --> 00:09.313
YEAH, THEY LET YOU DO IT
FOR FREE

00:09.357 --> 00:10.575
IF YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT

00:12.316 --> 00:13.839
SO CHECK AND CHECK.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.319
GOOD FOR YOU, PARKER.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.452
NEW YORK CAN BE A TOUGH PLACE
FOR A LITTLE GUY LIKE YOU.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.497
YEAH, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT
BULLYING STOPS WHEN YOU GROW UP,

00:19.541 --> 00:21.064
BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN
MY EXPERIENCE.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.500
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD TEACH ME SOME MOVES?

00:22.544 --> 00:23.588
OH, YEAH, SURE.

00:23.632 --> 00:24.807
COOL.
ABSOLUTELY.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.287
NOW, COME AT ME
AND GRAB ME, OKAY?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.636

CAN I TRY IT?

00:36.340 --> 00:37.298
JUST COME AT ME.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.777
I DON'T KNOW.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.736
ATTACKING MY FEMALE BOSS--
THIS...FEELS WEIRD.

00:40.779 --> 00:41.867
MAYBE A SCENARIO
WOULD HELP.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.739
IMAGINE YOU'RE
GRIEVING YOUR WIFE

00:43.782 --> 00:45.871

IN LOVE WITH YOU--GO.

00:47.438 --> 00:48.831

00:52.922 --> 00:53.705
NO, DO IT MY WAY.

I'M READY.

00:54.793 --> 00:55.881
YOU KILLED MY WIFE! YES!

00:55.925 --> 00:57.013

I HAVE ASTIGMATISM,
PRE-CATARACTS.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.242
OKAY, I'M SORRY.
KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.461
HE'S AMAZING.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.071
I REALLY LOVE HIM,
AND WE'RE READY TO HAVE SEX.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.072
SOON.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.334
I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND

04:51.378 --> 04:52.596
WHY YOU DID NOT WANT
TO GO DOLL SHOPPING

04:52.640 --> 04:54.163
WITH ME EARLIER.

04:54.206 --> 04:57.558
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION
THAT THERE IS A...

04:57.601 --> 05:01.475
A PROBLEM IN THE OFFICE.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.563
I FOUND A STRAY DOG.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.694
I KEPT HIM HERE
FOR THREE NIGHTS.

05:03.738 --> 05:06.218
HE HAD THESE SOULFUL EYES.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.177
I WAS NOT GONNA LEAVE HIM
AT THE QUARRY.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.439
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DOG.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.268
THAT'S A BAD THING,
SO DON'T DO THAT EITHER.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.617
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.185
IS THIS ABOUT THE OTHER DOG?

05:16.228 --> 05:18.056
NO.BECAUSE THAT IS A BAD DOG.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.668
IT HAS COME
TO MY ATTENTION, MORGAN,

05:20.711 --> 05:24.236
THAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT SHAUNA INAPPROPRIATELY.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.890
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.153
BUT I-I-I KNOW IT'S TRUE.

05:28.197 --> 05:31.069
BECAUSE IF THE MEN
IN MY FAMILY

05:31.113 --> 05:32.854
HAVE ONE PROBLEM,

05:32.897 --> 05:35.596
IT'S STARING
AT BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.988
AND GOUT.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.816
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF WE'RE LOOKING

05:38.860 --> 05:42.864
AT A BEAUTIFUL
MONA LISA-TYPE PAINTING

05:42.907 --> 05:45.780
OR A HEALTHY SET
OF PLUMPIES.

05:45.823 --> 05:49.827
SHAUNA, I ASSURE YOU,
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.786
I'M SO SORRY.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.483
LET'S BLOOD-OATH IT.
I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF--

05:53.527 --> 05:54.658
NO, NO, PUT THE--

05:54.702 --> 05:56.268
MORGAN, LET'S NOT
BLOOD-OATH ANYTHING.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.792
TERRIFIC.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.837
DOES THAT OFFICIALLY SATISFY
YOUR FORMAL COMPLAINT, SHAUNA?

05:59.881 --> 06:01.839
OH, I DIDN'T MAKE
A COMPLAINT.

06:01.883 --> 06:02.840
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.451
NO, I DIDN'T.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.496
I'D LIKE TO BE
REAL CLEAR ON THIS.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.629
DOES THIS OFFICE HAVE
A POLICY ON DOGS?

06:08.672 --> 06:11.022
HENRY AND I ARE PLANNING
ON DOING THIS NEXT WEEKEND.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.807
HIS PARENTS ARE TAKING
HIS GRANDMA

06:12.850 --> 06:14.156

IN FLORIDA,

06:14.199 --> 06:15.810
SO IT'S PRETTY MUCH A DATE.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.420
YOU'VE DESCRIBED THE PREMISE
TO A NATIONAL LAMPOONMOVIE.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.726
THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.815
I WISH THAT THERE HAD BEEN
SOMEONE LIKE ME AROUND

06:20.858 --> 06:22.730
FOR MYSELF
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.688
YOU LOST YOUR VIRGINITY
AT 15?

06:24.732 --> 06:25.733
I WISH THERE HAD BEEN
SOMEONE LIKE ME AROUND

06:25.776 --> 06:27.125
WHEN I WAS 23.

06:27.169 --> 06:28.649
I CAN'T GIVE THIS
TO YOU YET.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.738
COME ON, MINDY.
YOU KNOW ME.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.566

I HAVE TO MEET HIM.

06:34.481 --> 06:38.093
BUT HE'S IN SCHOOL.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.529

07:04.511 --> 07:05.990

ANY BIRTH CONTROL YOU WANT.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.210

07:08.253 --> 07:09.994
THAT COMES IN THE FORM
OF A LOLLIPOP.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.910
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
CALCULUS WAS A CATASTROPHE.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.956
BEN, THIS IS DR. LAHIRI.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.349
YOUR SHOES ARE INSANE,
AND YOUR TOP IS OUTTA CONTROL.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.003
CAN YOU BE MY DOCTOR?

07:19.047 --> 07:21.005
UM, I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE ADORABLE.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.833
HELLO, NEW FAVORITE PERSON.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.356
UGH, WHAT IS THAT?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.793
OH, THIS? IT'S SLIME.

07:25.836 --> 07:26.881
SLIME AS IN GHOSTBUSTERS?

07:26.924 --> 07:28.491
NO, NO, NO, SLIME AS IN SLIME.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.536
EVERYONE HAS SLIME NOW.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.276
OH, SO IT'S LIKE
AN ACCESSORY.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.408
UM, KIND OF.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.409
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.932
IS IT CONSIDERED BAD
OR GOOD?

07:34.976 --> 07:36.194
DON'T OVERTHINK SLIME.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.979
OKAY, CAN WE JUST, LIKE,
GET THIS OVER WITH?

07:38.022 --> 07:39.589

HEY. HEY, WHERE YOU BEEN?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.946

07:48.990 --> 07:50.426
SHE'S MY DOCTOR
AND MY NEIGHBOR.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.514
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.647
HEY.

07:59.957 --> 08:00.871
I HAVE TO SIT DOWN.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.569

[beanbag chair squeaks]
OH.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.272

08:10.315 --> 08:11.882
SO, HENRY,

08:11.926 --> 08:13.928
SOPHIA TELLS ME

08:13.971 --> 08:15.930
ARE CONSIDERING TAKING
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

08:15.973 --> 08:17.453
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.585
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE IN LOVE,

08:18.628 --> 08:20.804
AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE
TO EXPRESS IT.

08:20.848 --> 08:21.849
I WANT TO BE
WITH HER FOREVER.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.503
[paper ball thuds]

08:23.546 --> 08:24.678
I'M S--ONE SECOND.
HEY, CAN I--

08:24.721 --> 08:25.853
CAN I SEE THAT, PLEASE?

08:25.896 --> 08:27.245
THANK YOU.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.291
DON'T--DON'T THROW THINGS
NEAR A WOMAN'S FACE.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.641
ALL RIGHT, UM,
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN

08:31.685 --> 08:33.295
WHEN YOU GO TO COLLEGE?

08:33.338 --> 08:35.819
'SCUSE ME, ARE YOU GONNA STAY
HERE FOR A WHILE,

08:35.863 --> 08:37.212
OR ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
GOING THROUGH?

08:37.255 --> 08:38.605
ALL RIGHT, SORRY.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.868
WHY DON'T YOU KEEP--
YEP, YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

08:40.911 --> 08:41.956
I'M NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.000
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE?

08:43.044 --> 08:44.132
NO. WHY SHOULD I
LOAD UP ON DEBT

08:44.175 --> 08:45.568
JUST TO BINGE DRINK
FOR FOUR YEARS,

08:45.612 --> 08:46.830
WHEN I COULD JUST
CREATE AN APP

08:46.874 --> 08:48.049
THAT NETS ME ALL THE MONEY
I'LL EVER NEED?

08:48.092 --> 08:49.746
SORRY, HENRY.
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.400
WELL, MARK ZUCKERBERG
DROPPED OUT OF HARVARD.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.489
MARK ZUCKERBERG
GOT INTO HARVARD,

08:53.533 --> 08:54.838
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:54.882 --> 08:55.839
IF HE HAD STAYED AT HARVARD
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,

08:55.883 --> 08:57.058
THEN THAT FACEBOOK,

08:57.101 --> 08:58.799
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE...

08:58.842 --> 08:59.800
POPULAR SITE.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.758
OKAY.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.543
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.DO YOU NEED HELP?

09:03.586 --> 09:04.892
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SLIPPERY.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.371
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

09:06.415 --> 09:10.245
I DON'T NEED HELP GETTING
BACK INTO A BEANBAG CHAIR.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.029
I CAN DO IT. LET ME--
OH, GOD. OKAY.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.248
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.554
HANG ON.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.642
JUST PUSH MY TORSO UP.TRY USING YOUR KNEES.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.775
[beanbag chair
squeaking loudly]

09:18.819 --> 09:20.168
I'M A SURGEON.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.691
I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO SIT
IN A BEANBAG CHAIR.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.127
SEE?

09:23.171 --> 09:25.303
I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT SEX
IS THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.870
NO, NO, NO.
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.698
ALL RIGHT?
AND AS SOPHIA'S GYNECOLOGIST,

09:28.742 --> 09:30.134
I THINK THAT WHEN--[snickers]

09:30.178 --> 09:32.049
ARE YOU LAUGHING
AT THE WORD "GYNECOLOGIST"?

09:32.093 --> 09:33.355
OH, MY GOD.

09:33.398 --> 09:34.748
WHAT IF YOU GUYS
HAD A BABY?

09:34.791 --> 09:35.792
I DON'T KNOW.

09:35.836 --> 09:36.880
SOPHIA COULD TAKE CARE
OF IT, YEAH?

09:36.924 --> 09:38.447
YEAH, I MEAN,
I'M A BABYSITTER, MINDY.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.275
NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT
BABYSITTING YOUR BABY.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.450
YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE,
ALL RIGHT?

09:41.493 --> 09:42.886
WHILE THIS JOKER

09:42.930 --> 09:44.671
LIVES IN HIS PARENTS' BASEMENT
WORKING ON SOME APP

09:44.714 --> 09:46.542
THAT TELLS YOU WHAT
PIZZA TOPPING YOU ARE.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.500
IT TELLS YOU WHICH SUPERHERO
YOU SHOULD MARRY.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.241
OBVIOUSLY, YOU WOULD MARRY
CAPTAIN AMERICA.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.069
YOU DON'T NEED AN APP
TO TELL YOU THAT.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.375
LOOK, IF I WANTED
TO BE QUESTIONED

09:53.418 --> 09:54.811
BY SOME WEIRD OLD LADY,

09:54.855 --> 09:55.986
I'D GO HOME
AND TALK TO MY STEPMOM.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.335
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS SLIME.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.729
I'M SORRY.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.123
I'M OBVIOUSLY YOUNGER
THAN HIS STEPMOM.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.561
SOPHIA, I CANNOT SIGN OFF ON THIS GUY.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.694
HOW ARE YOU
THE ULTIMATE JUDGE OF GUYS?

10:07.737 --> 10:10.348
I SAW YOU HIT ON YOUR CHINESE
DELIVERY MAN ONE TIME.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.612
OKAY, IT WAS VALENTINE'S DAY,
AND HE WAS LINGERING.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.526
[sighs]AND NOW I ACTUALLY HAVE

10:14.570 --> 10:17.181
A BOYFRIEND WHO IS MATURE
AND CONSIDERATE,

10:17.225 --> 10:18.661
AND HE'S THE KIND OF GUY
THAT'S WORTH WAITING FOR.

10:18.705 --> 10:19.923
AND HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF I ASKED HIM

10:19.967 --> 10:21.359
A BUNCH OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS?

10:21.403 --> 10:23.013
I WOULD BE FINE
WITH THAT,

10:23.057 --> 10:24.493
AND THE NEXT TIME HE IS OVER,
I WELCOME YOU

10:24.536 --> 10:25.581
TO COME TO THE APARTMENT--

10:25.625 --> 10:27.452
NO, NOW!
I WANT TO MEET HIM TODAY.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.454
OKAY, WELL, I AM SUPPOSED
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH HIM AT 1:00.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.804
FINE. I'LL BE THERE.

10:30.847 --> 10:33.023
YOU HAVE CLASS.YEAH, THE HISTORY
OF DUBSTEP.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.677
YEAH, YOU CAN SKIP THAT.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.158
DEAR HORIZON
MEDICAL SOLUTIONS,

10:37.201 --> 10:39.682
WHEN THE DRAWSTRING
IN YOUR SCRUBS GETS CAUGHT

10:39.726 --> 10:42.772
IN THAT TINY HOLE,
I FIND IT BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

10:42.816 --> 10:44.295
TO FISH IT OUT.
I'M A BUSY GUY,

10:44.339 --> 10:45.514
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.037
BETSY, CAN YOU JUST READ
THAT BACK FOR ME?

10:47.081 --> 10:50.650
"DEAR HORIZON

10:57.221 --> 10:58.614
BETSY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.789
OKAY, LAST WEEK,
I WAS IN AN OPERATION,

10:59.833 --> 11:01.399
AND THE SCRUBS WENT
DOWN TO MY ANKLES.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.574
DR. CASTELLANO,

11:02.618 --> 11:05.360
I WROTE THAT
HUMAN RESOURCE COMPLAINT

11:05.403 --> 11:07.536
ABOUT MORGAN STARING
AT SHAUNA.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.364
WHAT?
DR. CASTELLANO,

11:09.407 --> 11:11.540
DO YOU THINK I'M PRETTY?

11:11.583 --> 11:14.804
AH, BOY.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.588
HEY.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.590
I THINK I'M HAVING
LUNCH WITH YOU.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.288
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.332
HEY.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.769
HEY, MAMA.HOW'S IT GOING?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.031

FROM MY BUILDING.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.034
OH, YES!

11:27.077 --> 11:28.688
SOPHIA WANTED TO TALK

11:28.731 --> 11:30.385
TO A SUPER COOL BOYFRIEND
TO FIND OUT

11:30.428 --> 11:32.692
WHAT A GOOD ADULT RELATIONSHIP
SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.215
MM. FIRE AWAY.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.520
HOW DID YOU MEET MINDY?

11:35.564 --> 11:36.826
AT A NIGHTCLUB.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.436
NORMALLY I GO
FOR SUPER SKINNY WHITE GIRLS,

11:38.480 --> 11:41.657
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ONE
SCREAMED, "YEAH, OKAY."

11:41.701 --> 11:43.703
AND ARE YOU TWO
SLEEPING TOGETHER?

11:43.746 --> 11:45.530
WHAT DO I DO HERE?IT'S COOL.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.663
YES, WE HAVE BEEN PHYSICAL.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.752
DO YOU USE BIRTH CONTROL?

11:49.796 --> 11:51.014
COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.015
AND IF SHE GOT PREGNANT,
WOULD YOU, LIKE,

11:52.059 --> 11:53.321
TOTALLY FREAK OUT?

11:53.364 --> 11:54.975
MAMA MIA.
BLITZKRIEG OVER HERE.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.716
HEY, SHE TOLD ME I COULD ASK
WHATEVER I WANTED.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.543
YEAH, I'D FREAK OUT.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.675
AND THEN I WOULD HELP
RAISE IT.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.546
YOU WOULD?

12:01.590 --> 12:03.766
I'M NOT 23 ANYMORE.
KID SOUNDS KINDA COOL.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.028
I LOVE PLAYING CATCH,

12:05.072 --> 12:06.638
AND IT'S KINDA WEIRD
WITH TWO GROWNUP DUDES.

12:06.682 --> 12:08.336
YOU SEE, SOPHIA,
THIS IS THE KIND OF GUY

12:08.379 --> 12:09.467
THAT YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR,
ALL RIGHT?

12:09.511 --> 12:11.774
HE IS SWEET.
HE WENT TO COLLEGE.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.429
HE IS FUNNY-ISH.

12:14.472 --> 12:17.780
SO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE,
LIKE, TOGETHER FOREVER?

12:17.824 --> 12:20.174
UHHH, THINGS ARE GOING
REALLY GOOD.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.741
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.873
HENRY SAYS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.701
IT'S EVEN HIS SIGNATURE
AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL HIS EMAILS.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.834
WELL, MY LAW FIRM
FORBIDS TINKERING

12:27.877 --> 12:29.618
WITH THE STANDARD
CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE

12:29.661 --> 12:30.880
AT THE BOTTOM
OF ALL OUR EMAILS.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.621
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.666
WILL YOU AND MINDY
BE TOGETHER FOREVER?

12:34.710 --> 12:36.233
UH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER THAT.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.105
ACTUALLY, YOU DO HAVE TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.410
LOOK, IT'S A NICE IDEA,

12:39.454 --> 12:41.630
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD STAY WITH ONE PERSON

12:41.673 --> 12:44.024
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.548
YOU DON'T EVER WANT
TO GET MARRIED?

12:46.591 --> 12:48.637
MAYBE I'M NOT
A FOREVER KIND OF GUY.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.682
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

12:50.726 --> 12:52.249
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO HAVE
A FEW THINGS TO DISCUSS,

12:52.293 --> 12:54.425
SO I'M GONNA LET YOU GUYS
FIGURE THAT OUT

12:54.469 --> 12:55.600
WHILE I HEAD BACK TO SCHOOL.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.689
CATCH YOU ON THE SLIME.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.737
WHAT'S SLIME?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.086
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SLIME IS.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.787
I JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGES.
WHAT'S UP?

13:07.830 --> 13:09.049
JOSH CALLED ME HUMAN GARBAGE.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.702
WHAT?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.182
OKAY, HE DIDN'T EXACTLY
CALL ME HUMAN GARBAGE,

13:12.226 --> 13:14.532
BUT HE TOLD ME THAT HE IS NOT
A "FOREVER" TYPE OF GUY.

13:14.576 --> 13:15.838
[Gwen]
OH, THAT'S IT?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.927
EVERYBODY HAS TROUBLE
WITH THE WORD "FOREVER."

13:17.971 --> 13:19.015
A WEEK BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED,

13:19.059 --> 13:21.104
CARL DISAPPEARED
FOR A FEW DAYS.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.889
I HIKED THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL!
I GOT LYME DISEASE!

13:22.932 --> 13:24.064
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT,
ACTUALLY.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.717
[Carl]
I GOT BIT BY A DEER!

13:25.761 --> 13:27.284
HOLD ON. [Mindy]
GWEN, I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN

13:27.328 --> 13:29.809
THAT I WAS GONNA GET MARRIED
AND STAY MARRIED FOREVER.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.940
'CAUSE THAT IS TRUE LOVE.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.942
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I WANTED TO KEEP

13:32.986 --> 13:34.683
MY TENNIS BAG
IN YOUR CLOSET?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.859
IT WAS OUR WORST FIGHT
OF 2006.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.730
I REMEMBER THAT.
I HATED THAT.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.558
GWEN, WHAT IF I HAD NEEDED
TO GET MY SNORKEL, OKAY?

13:40.602 --> 13:42.169
AND I HAD TO LIFT YOUR DUMB
TENNIS BAG TO GET IT?

13:42.212 --> 13:43.866
IMAGINE THAT
TIMES A MILLION.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.607
THAT'S MARRIAGE,

13:45.650 --> 13:47.957
EXCEPT THE CLOSET
IS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE,

13:48.001 --> 13:50.177
AND THE TENNIS BAG
IS A GUY.

13:50.220 --> 13:53.093
AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND
HIS TOENAIL CLIPPINGS

13:53.136 --> 13:54.746
SCATTERED AROUND YOUR TOILET.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.792
JUST TO BE CLEAR,
I USE THE TOILET AS A SEAT.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.446
I DON'T TRIM THEM
WHEN I'M GOING.

13:58.489 --> 14:01.623
OKAY, SOMETIMES MARRIAGE
IS GREAT.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.365
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO BE A KID
TO THINK THAT SAYING "FOREVER"

14:04.408 --> 14:06.019
IS THE SAME
AS ACTUALLY DOING IT.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.629
GWEN, YOU ARE SO SMART.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.849
I WISH THAT WE WERE LESBIANS
SO WE COULD GET MARRIED.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.067
I'M SERIOUS.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.373
I MEAN, WE WOULDN'T HAVE SEX
OR ANYTHING.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.591
MAYBE A LITTLE KISSING.

14:13.635 --> 14:14.636
[Gwen]
THERE YOU GO.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.681
OH, OH, OH, MY GOD.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.074
[Gwen]
CARL, THIS TREE FALLS
OFF THE ROOF ONE MORE TIME,

14:18.118 --> 14:19.206
I SWEAR TO GOD--

14:19.249 --> 14:21.338
MINDY, YOU DESERVE
THE BEST!
[sighs]

14:21.382 --> 14:22.600
[Carl]
NEVER SETTLE. DO YOU HEAR ME?

14:22.644 --> 14:25.865
ALL RIGHT,
THANKS, CARL. BYE.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.956
[whispers]
DAMN IT.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.308
I JUST WANT GUYS
TO LOOK AT ME

14:34.351 --> 14:35.657
THE WAY THEY LOOK AT SHAUNA.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.224
UGH.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.356
[sighs]

14:41.271 --> 14:42.925
JUST WISH I WAS PRETTY.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.319
[sighs]

14:45.362 --> 14:47.930
BETSY, YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.192
REALLY, DR. CASTELLANO?

14:49.236 --> 14:51.238
ABSOLUTELY. YOU'RE PRETTY.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE CUTE.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.979
YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE JUST ADORABLE.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.416
GUYS DON'T WANT ADORABLE.
THEY WANT HOT.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.113
WELL, YOU DEFINITELY ARE.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.332
DEFINITELY ARE WHAT?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.463
JUST WORK WITH ME HERE,
BETSY, OKAY?

14:59.507 --> 15:00.769
YOU'RE HOT.
YOU'RE HOT. OKAY?

15:00.812 --> 15:01.944
YOU'RE DEFINITELY HOT.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.250
I DON'T KNOW. YEAH, YOU'RE HOT.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.947
YOU GOT A GREAT--
YOU GOT A GREAT FACE,

15:04.991 --> 15:06.949
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.646
YOU GOT, UH,
LEGS OF STEEL.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.432
I DO LIVE
IN A FIFTH-FLOOR WALKUP.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.607
WELL, IT'S WORKING GOOD,

15:12.650 --> 15:14.609
AND YOUR WHOLE...

15:14.652 --> 15:16.916
YOUR FORM IS JUST--
IT'S VERY GOOD.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.308
OH.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.179
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY LOOK
LIKE THAT MOVIE STAR,

15:19.222 --> 15:20.180
JESSICA...

15:20.223 --> 15:21.964
RABBIT?
[laughs]

15:22.008 --> 15:22.834
SURE.
REALLY?

15:22.878 --> 15:24.227
SHE'S AWESOME.
YEAH.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.968
HOPPING ALONG LIKE THAT.SHE DOESN'T HOP, BUT...

15:26.012 --> 15:27.404
NO?
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.623
SO ARE YOU.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.841
THANK YOU,
DR. CASTELLANO. OH!

15:29.885 --> 15:31.713
I THINK SOMETIMES
YOU JUST NEED YOUR BOSS

15:31.756 --> 15:33.454
TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU LOOK SEXY.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.716
NO, THAT'S, UH--

15:34.759 --> 15:36.065
THAT WASN'T WHAT
I WAS SAYING AT--

15:36.109 --> 15:37.719
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

15:37.762 --> 15:38.763
BETSY, PLEASE--
OH.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.897
I GOTTA CALL A LAWYER.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.768
SOPHIA!

15:43.812 --> 15:44.900
HEY!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.771
OH, MY GOD.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.121
HOW ARE YOU HERE
RIGHT NOW?

15:48.164 --> 15:49.426
LOOK...

15:49.470 --> 15:51.951
LOOK, I JUST CAME HERE
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

15:51.994 --> 15:52.995
OW!

15:53.039 --> 15:54.127
HEADS UP!

15:54.170 --> 15:55.215
I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO YELL THAT

15:55.258 --> 15:56.956
BEFORE IT HITS SOMEBODY
IN THE HEAD!

15:56.999 --> 16:00.002
ALL RIGHT,
YOUR BOYFRIEND HAS

16:00.046 --> 16:01.961
SOME STUPID IDEAS
ABOUT COLLEGE,

16:02.004 --> 16:04.224
AND HE IS LITERALLY COVERED
IN BODY SPRAY.

16:04.267 --> 16:07.967
BUT HE'S FINE.
AND I'M NOT BLIND.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.577
HENRY IS CRAZY BANGABLE.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.752
THANK YOU.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.972
I'M JUST NOT CRAZY

16:13.015 --> 16:14.669
ABOUT YOU GUYS
HAVING SEX ALREADY.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.976
OW! YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME!

16:17.019 --> 16:18.978
ALL RIGHT,
VOLLEYBALL PRACTICE IS OVER.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.676
A SMART ADULT
IS GIVING OUT FREE ADVICE.

16:21.719 --> 16:22.894
EVERYONE GATHER AROUND.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.896
OKAY, HERE IS WHAT
I'VE OBSERVED

16:24.940 --> 16:25.854
ABOUT YOU TEENAGERS.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.160
ONE, YOU HAVE TERRIBLE AIM.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.683
YOU HIT ME IN THE HEAD TWICE
WITH A VOLLEYBALL.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.467
THAT WAS NOT COOL.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.948
SECONDLY, YOU ARE OBSESSED
WITH ETERNITY.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.732
EVERYTHING IS FOREVER.
BEST FRIENDS FOREVER.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.865
HENRY AND SOPHIA FOREVER.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.867
IT'S PROBABLY WHY
YOU LIKE TEEN VAMPIRES

16:38.910 --> 16:40.564
AND STUPID CRAP LIKE THAT.
GUESS WHAT.

16:40.608 --> 16:41.565
THAT STUFF'S IMAGINARY.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.263
[sighs]

16:43.306 --> 16:44.699
SORRY, BABE.
IT'S TRUE.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.614
ALL RIGHT, TEENS FALL FOR THIS
ALL THE TIME.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.051
HELL, EVEN TEEN-PLUSES
LIKE ME FALL FOR IT.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.792
YEAH, AND MAYBE YOU'LL BE
REALLY LUCKY,

16:50.835 --> 16:52.620
AND YOU'LL FIND
THE PERFECT GUY,

16:52.663 --> 16:55.057
AND YOU WILL STAY
TOGETHER FOREVER.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.841
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING

16:56.885 --> 16:57.973
THAT ALWAYS LASTS FOREVER--

16:58.017 --> 17:00.367
FRIENDSHIP?
HERPES.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.064
IT'S GROSS,
AND IT IS HORRIBLE.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.197
GOOGLE-IMAGE-SEARCH IT.
IT'S DISGUSTING.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.676
IT'S NOT ALL
RUNNING THROUGH FIELDS

17:05.720 --> 17:07.287
AND HANG GLIDING,
LIKE THE ADS TELL YOU.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.505
AND GUESS WHAT, GUYS.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.507
HERPES IS ONE
OF THE BETTER ONES.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.988
I CANNOT KEEP YOU FROM GETTING YOUR HEART BROKEN.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.860
I CAN'T EVEN KEEP YOU
FROM HAVING SEX.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.601
BUT I CAN MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE SAFE.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.255
CONDOMS, YOU GUYS.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.648
YOU CAN'T TRUST THE GUYS
IN YOUR LIFE TO HAVE THEM.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.171
HERE YOU GO.
FOR YOU.

17:22.215 --> 17:25.740
HERE YOU GO.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.959
YOU LOOK LIKE TROUBLE.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO.

17:28.003 --> 17:30.179
YOU I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.659
UH, CAN I HELP YOU?
ARE YOU A PARENT?

17:31.702 --> 17:33.182
I AM NOT A PARENT.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.445
I AM SIMPLY A CONCERNED
ADULT WOMAN,

17:35.489 --> 17:37.099
HELPING OUT
SOME AT-RISK YOUTHS.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.841
AND WHAT ARE YOU
HANDING OUT THERE?

17:39.884 --> 17:40.842
UM...

17:40.885 --> 17:42.365
THIS FEELS EXCESSIVE,

17:42.409 --> 17:44.976
AND I BET
IF I WERE A WHITE MALE,

17:45.020 --> 17:46.282
YOU WOULDN'T--
OKAY.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.067
WELL, MAYBE YOU WOULD.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.853
I BELIEVE THIS HAS BEEN
BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.160
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU REFERRED
TO ONE OF OUR MALE STUDENTS

17:54.203 --> 17:56.727
AS "CRAZY BANGABLE"?

17:56.771 --> 17:58.860
OKAY, WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
DID MEGAN TELL YOU THAT?

17:58.903 --> 18:00.688
THAT WAS IN THE SERVICE OF A POINT.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.820
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK
INTO A HIGH SCHOOL

18:02.864 --> 18:06.041
AND THROW SEXUAL
PARAPHERNALIA AT KIDS!

18:06.085 --> 18:07.825
I DIDN'T THROW ANYTHING
AT ANYONE.

18:07.869 --> 18:08.826
THAT'S TAWDRY.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.219
AND BY THE WAY, THESE ARE NOT--

18:10.263 --> 18:11.264
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

18:11.307 --> 18:12.656
THIS HIGH SCHOOL
IS RIDICULOUS.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.484
I MEAN, IT'S SO SWANKY HERE.

18:14.528 --> 18:15.485
IT'S SO NICE.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.704
MY HIGH SCHOOL, ONE WINDOW

18:16.747 --> 18:18.271
THAT JUST THE SENIORS
COULD USE--JUST ONE.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.750
DANNY, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.839
PLEASE JUST TELL THEM THAT I'M
NOT SOME CRAZY PERVERT.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.928
I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA LIE
TO THEM. DANNY!

18:23.972 --> 18:25.495
[bell rings]

18:25.539 --> 18:27.715
SO YOU'RE HERE
LOOKING FOR GUYS?

18:27.758 --> 18:30.065
LET THE POOR BASTARDS
FINISH HIGH SCHOOL

18:30.109 --> 18:31.632
BEFORE YOU START
GRABBING AT 'EM.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.025
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THEY WISH.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.244
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH ME

18:35.288 --> 18:36.680
WITH THEIR LITTLE
TEENAGE HANDS.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.422
SECOND OF ALL, DANNY,
THANK YOU FOR BAILING ME OUT

18:39.466 --> 18:41.337
OF SCHOOL JAIL.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.556
FOR THAT, I SHALL GIVE YOU
ONE BEAUTIFUL ORCHID.

18:42.599 --> 18:45.036
JUST GIVE ME A SLICE.
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.603
ALL RIGHT, A SLICE
AND AN ORCHID.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.388
MINDY, MINDY.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.826
SO I THINK HENRY AND I ARE GONNA
WAIT A WHILE TO HAVE...

18:51.869 --> 18:52.914
THAT--THAT THING.

18:52.957 --> 18:53.915
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YEAH.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.264
OH, THANK GOD.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.701
I MEAN, IT WAS TOTALLY
UP TO YOU, YOUR DECISION,

18:57.745 --> 18:59.181
BUT YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.314
ALSO, I REALLY WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.491
SLIME? FOR ME?
MM-HMM.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.319
I HEARD ABOUT THE DRAMA.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.538
MY GOD, I AM OBSESSED
WITH YOU.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.192
BEN, YOU ARE SUCH
A SPECIAL KID.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
AND I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW,
IT GETS BETTER.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.979
HOW COULD IT?

19:15.023 --> 19:16.198
[Ben]
YOU WISH, STEVEN.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.113
WHO IS THIS PERSON?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.158
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
I'M DANNY.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.507
SHUT UP.

19:20.550 --> 19:21.899
THAT'S MY FAVORITE NAME.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.031
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.164
I LIKE BEN A LOT.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.991
TELL ME YOU AND HIM
HAVE HAPPENED.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.689
UGH, BEN!
WHAT?

19:28.732 --> 19:29.864
NO.

19:29.907 --> 19:30.995
OKAY, GUYS, WE SHOULD LEAVE
THE PREMISES.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.040
YEAH.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.215
I COULD ACTUALLY ARRESTED
FOR REAL

19:33.259 --> 19:34.434
IF I STICK AROUND
TOO MUCH LONGER.

19:34.477 --> 19:35.478
BYE.
[Ben]
BYE.

19:35.522 --> 19:36.566
[Sophia]
BYE, MINDY.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.524
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE SLIME.

19:37.567 --> 19:38.960
NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.229
HEY.
HEY.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.622
SO THE FLORIST WAS CLOSED,

19:48.665 --> 19:50.189
BUT I WANTED TO GET YOU
SOMETHING GIRLY,

19:50.232 --> 19:52.147
SO I POPPED INTO THE PHARMACY AND GOT YOU

19:52.191 --> 19:54.454
SOME OF THESE
TRAVEL-SIZE DEODORANTS.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.412
THANK YOU.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.240
I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.633
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SORRY.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.635
I WAS JUST SURPRISED
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW

20:01.678 --> 20:03.071
THAT THIS WAS SO CASUAL.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.247
IT'S NOT CASUAL.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.249
IT'S JUST--
HERE'S WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.555
JOSH, LET ME
INTERRUPT YOU.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.383
CAN I JUST TELL YOU
WHAT I WAS THINKING?

20:10.426 --> 20:12.123
LOVE IT.
BOOM. GO.
YEAH?

20:12.167 --> 20:13.516
YEAH. WANT AN ENERGY DRINK?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.344
YEAH, OKAY.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.390
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.088
MM.

20:20.131 --> 20:23.091
I THINK THIS IS
AN ACQUIRED TASTE.
YEAH.

20:23.134 --> 20:27.356
SO FOREVER IS SCARY
FOR ME TOO, ALL RIGHT?

20:27.400 --> 20:29.445
DO YOU KNOW IN MY SHOWER,
THERE'S THAT LEDGE FOR SHAMPOO?

20:29.489 --> 20:30.751
IT'S LIKE THAT BIG.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.057
I COULD NEVER SHARE THAT
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.842
OH, YOU GOTTA GET
A SHOWER CADDY.

20:34.885 --> 20:37.192
IT FALLS ON YOU SOMETIMES,
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.802
OKAY.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.630
WELL, I GUESS WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO SAY WAS,

20:40.674 --> 20:42.719
EVEN THOUGH IT'S SCARY,

20:42.763 --> 20:46.462
I THINK THAT IF THIS
IS GONNA KEEP GOING,

20:46.506 --> 20:49.117
THERE HAS TO BE
AT LEAST A POSSIBILITY

20:49.160 --> 20:50.858
THAT WE COULD STAY
TOGETHER FOREVER.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.686
I CAN DO THAT.NO, FOR REAL,
THOUGH, JOSH.

20:52.729 --> 20:56.211
LIKE, WHEN WE DIE,
WE GET BURIED SIDE BY SIDE.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.560
WE HAVE MATCHING TOMBSTONES,

20:57.604 --> 21:00.259
A STATUE OF A CHERUB
CRYING NEXT TO US.

21:00.302 --> 21:03.044
OUR GRANDKIDS COME
AND VISIT THE GRAVESITE,

21:03.087 --> 21:04.959
TALK ABOUT US.
YEAH.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.613
HOW COOL
THEIR GRANDMOTHER WAS,

21:06.656 --> 21:08.267
HOW WEIRD
THEIR GRANDFATHER WAS.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.964
[laughs]
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT?

21:10.007 --> 21:11.966
LET ME PITCH YOU THIS.
WE GET CREMATED, RIGHT?

21:12.009 --> 21:13.315
MIXED TOGETHER,

21:13.359 --> 21:15.970
