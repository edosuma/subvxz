TO THAT BABY, HUH?

Piper: DO WHAT?

00:11.837 --> 00:12.751
ISN'T SHE SOMETHING?

00:12.925 --> 00:14.405
SHE'S SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT.

OH, MAN. STRAIGHT 6,
4-SPEED TRANNY.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.584

00:19.758 --> 00:21.108
60 YEARS AGO.

THAT FIRST TIME I WAS ALIVE.

DOWN NOW, WILL YOU?

00:26.809 --> 00:28.463
OH. RIGHT. SORRY. HA HA.

00:28.637 --> 00:29.855
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.467
I THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:32.641 --> 00:35.426
I THINK $9,000
IS A LOT OF MONEY.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.646
9,500 ACTUALLY.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.126
BUT THAT INCLUDES
THE ORIGINAL TAILGATE,

00:39.300 --> 00:40.518

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

NOT EASY FINDING A '41

00:45.828 --> 00:48.309
AND WITH MATCHING
SERIAL NUMBERS TO BOOT.

LOOK LIKE MUCH NOW.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.052
NO, IT DOESN'T.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.054
BUT IT WILL
WHEN I'M DONE WITH IT.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.490
I JUST SAND OFF
SOME OF THE RUST,

REBUILD THE ENGINE.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.972

THAT'S HALF THE FUN.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.713
WHEN I'M DONE
WITH THIS PUPPY,

01:01.887 --> 01:03.454
IT'S GONNA BE WORTH,
WHAT, 25 GRAND, 30 GRAND?

01:03.628 --> 01:05.152
AT LEAST.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.284
AND THINK, MAYBE SOMEDAY
I CAN PASS IT ON TO THE BOYS.

ON KEEPING THIS THING?

01:09.765 --> 01:11.462

THE ANGEL OF DEATH,

TELLING ME THIS NOW?

02:46.818 --> 02:48.516
WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT TO WORRY YOU.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.300

WHEN?

THIS MORNING,
DOWNTOWN WITH LEO.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.957

MEANS ANYTHING, REALLY.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.959
I'VE HEARD THE ONLY PERSON
THAT SEES HIM

02:57.133 --> 02:58.830
IS THE PERSON
HE'S COMING AFTER.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.484
NO. THAT'S NOT
NECESSARILY TRUE.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.052
WE ALL SAW HIM LAST TIME
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.

WE WERE PROTECTING THE GUY

WHO, INCIDENTALLY, HE GOT.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.538
YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT IF
HE REALLY WANTED ME,

03:10.712 --> 03:12.844
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN ME
RIGHT THEN AND THERE, RIGHT?

03:13.018 --> 03:14.759
OK, YOU HAVE A POINT.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.761
SO MAYBE I JUST
THOUGHT I SAW HIM.

ARE DOING FINE.

WHAT I ALWAYS DO

03:31.036 --> 03:32.777
WHEN EVERYTHING IS
GOING WELL IN MY LIFE.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.021
IT WASN'T EASY
FINDING YOU,

20:40.195 --> 20:43.764
THOUGH I MUST ADMIT I DID
RATHER ENJOY THE CHALLENGE.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.374
PLEASE, I--

20:45.548 --> 20:48.682
DON'T BOTHER. TRUST ME.
I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.859
BUT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.429
I MEAN, MY FIRST LIFE
ENDED PREMATURELY.

20:56.603 --> 20:59.214
I GAVE UP BEING
A WHITELIGHTER

20:59.388 --> 21:01.651
AND AN ELDER SO I CAN
LIVE AGAIN...

21:03.131 --> 21:06.352
SO I CAN LOVE AGAIN.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.745
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN NOW?

21:08.919 --> 21:10.791
ALL LIFE ENDS, LEO,

21:10.965 --> 21:12.880
SOONER OR LATER.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.971
BUT COULD I AT LEAST
SEE MY SON AGAIN?

21:24.239 --> 21:26.067
[LEO YELLS]

21:26.241 --> 21:28.199
[HORN HONKING]

21:32.987 --> 21:34.336
I MEAN, HERE'S THE THING.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.643
WE SHOULD HAVE HOPE
THAT IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD.

21:36.817 --> 21:40.386
RIGHT? I MEAN, LOOK AROUND.
THESE GUYS ARE BACK TO NORMAL.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.302
AND THE SPELL
OBVIOUSLY WORE OFF.

21:46.566 --> 21:47.915
HI. I'M LOOKING
FOR MY HUSBAND.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.395
MA'AM,
IF YOU'LL JUST WAIT.

21:49.569 --> 21:50.787
NO. HIS NAME IS
LEO WYATT. THEY CALLED

21:50.961 --> 21:52.572
AND SAID HE WAS IN
SOME KIND OF CAR CRASH,

21:52.746 --> 21:54.008
AND I JUST
NEED TO KNOW--

21:54.182 --> 21:55.444
JUST A MOMENT,
PLEASE.
NO, ACTUALLY...

21:55.618 --> 21:57.185
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE
MY HUSBAND IS RIGHT NOW.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.534
DID YOU SAY
HIS NAME WAS LEO?

21:58.708 --> 21:59.753
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

21:59.927 --> 22:01.537
I'M ONE OF THE DOCTORS
ON HIS CASE.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.060
CASE? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN "CASE"?

22:03.234 --> 22:04.975
YOUR HUSBAND WAS ADMITTED
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR AGO.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.499
BUT WE'VE MANAGED
TO STABILIZE HIM.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.196
OK, SO THAT'S
GOOD, RIGHT?

22:08.370 --> 22:10.807
YES, THAT'S GOOD,
BUT WE REALLY WON'T KNOW

22:10.981 --> 22:12.722
THE EXTENT OF HIS INJURIES
UNTIL WE OPERATE.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.681
WE'RE PREPPING HIM
FOR SURGERY NOW.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.422
SURGERY?

22:16.596 --> 22:18.424
IT'S CALLED
AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY,

22:18.598 --> 22:19.990
TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT
HIS INTERNAL BLEEDING

22:20.164 --> 22:21.514
IS FROM A SPLENIC LACERATION

22:21.688 --> 22:23.603
OR A TEAR IN ONE
OF HIS KIDNEYS OR AORTA.

22:23.777 --> 22:26.432
OK, WAIT. SLOW DOWN.
IN ENGLISH.

22:26.606 --> 22:29.609
IS IT LIFE-THREATENING?

22:29.783 --> 22:31.132
YES, IT IS.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.442
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.922
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
WE CAN, I PROMISE YOU.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.271
I CAN'T DO THIS.

22:40.446 --> 22:41.316
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS
RIGHT NOW.

22:41.490 --> 22:42.752
PLEASE
TRY TO BE POSITIVE.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.494
EH--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:45.668 --> 22:47.888
I CAN'T DO THIS.
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.977
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN'T FREEZE
THIS PROBLEM FOREVER, PIPER.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.066
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU CAN'T.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.899
UH, CAN I SEE
MY HUSBAND, PLEASE?

23:20.442 --> 23:21.487
HEY.

23:21.661 --> 23:23.532
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:23.706 --> 23:25.621
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.
YOU HAD AN ACCIDENT,

23:25.795 --> 23:27.623
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

23:27.797 --> 23:31.061
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN A BAD LIAR.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.678
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
IN FOR SURGERY SOON.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.984
BUT I'LL BE WAITING FOR
YOU WHEN YOU COME OUT.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.508
TELL THE BOYS--

23:42.682 --> 23:44.161
NO. STOP IT.

23:44.335 --> 23:47.469
YOU CAN TELL THEM EVERYTHING
ONCE YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.952
WE'RE GONNA BEAT THIS, LEO,
JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.432
PIPER--

23:53.606 --> 23:55.825
NOW LISTEN TO ME.
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.479
YOU GOT TO FIGHT THIS.

23:57.653 --> 24:00.439
I CAN'T DO THIS
BY MYSELF.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.446
Doctor: MA'AM,
WE'RE READY FOR SURGERY.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.406
DON'T GIVE UP.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.411
I LOVE YOU.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.501
YOU, TOO.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.296
HOW'S HE DOING?

24:34.124 --> 24:36.953
LOOK, UH...YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.303
SOMETHING IS
NOT RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.480
PAIGE.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.916
NO, I'M SERIOUS. LOOK,
PIPER, THINGS LIKE THIS

24:43.090 --> 24:44.483
DON'T HAPPEN TO US.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.310
I MEAN, WHAT IF THIS
ISN'T JUST AN ACCIDENT?

24:46.485 --> 24:48.399
WHAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING
DEMONIC BEHIND IT?

24:48.574 --> 24:50.053
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

24:50.227 --> 24:51.838
THE ANGEL OF DEATH TOLD YOU
LEO WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE,

24:52.012 --> 24:53.274
WHICH MEANS WE'RE ALREADY
WAY PAST RANDOM CHANCE

24:53.448 --> 24:54.754
WHEN THE TRUCK HIT HIM.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.233
YOU'RE GRASPING
AT STRAWS.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.974
MAYBE, BUT ACCORDING
TO THAT COP OVER THERE,

24:58.148 --> 24:59.323
THEY HAVE THE DRIVER
IN CUSTODY,

24:59.498 --> 25:00.890
WHICH MEANS

25:01.064 --> 25:02.544
THIS COULD VERY WELL NOT BE
AN ACCIDENT AFTER ALL.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.198
HOW DOES THAT HELP LEO?

25:04.372 --> 25:06.548
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
MAGICAL GOING ON HERE,

25:06.722 --> 25:09.203
MAYBE SOMETHING MAGICAL
CAN FIX IT.

25:09.377 --> 25:12.032
OK, SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.

25:12.206 --> 25:13.512
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25:13.686 --> 25:15.862
TO CHEAT DEATH.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.180
[GASPS]

25:33.923 --> 25:35.795
USUALLY
I CHARGE ADMISSION.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.361
THAT DEMON WAS MINE.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.582
"WAS" BEING
THE OPERATIVE WORD.

25:42.497 --> 25:43.759
I'M AFRAID
THE ONE WHO HIRED ME

25:43.933 --> 25:45.805
ISN'T READY FOR YOU
TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.458
YEAH, AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE?

25:47.633 --> 25:49.635
AH. WOULDN'T YOU
LIKE TO KNOW?

25:49.809 --> 25:51.550
PERHAPS THEN YOU
COULD GET SOME ANSWERS

25:51.724 --> 25:52.942
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

25:53.116 --> 25:56.511
MY SISTER?
HOW DID YOU KNOW--

26:00.297 --> 26:03.387
I ALWAYS WANTED
A WITCH FOR A TROPHY.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.041
[OBJECT IS THROWN]

26:09.002 --> 26:11.004
I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE BACKUP.

26:11.178 --> 26:14.224
OH, THANKS.
WHAT ABOUT LEO?

26:14.398 --> 26:16.618
PIPER WILL CALL
IF SHE NEEDS ME.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.098
WHAT'S
THIS GUY'S DEAL?

26:18.272 --> 26:20.404
WELL, SOMEONE HIRED HIM
TO TAKE OUT REINHARDT.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.668
THE SAME SOMEONE WHO
KNOWS ABOUT MY SISTER.

26:22.842 --> 26:25.671
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET SOME ANSWERS?

26:28.369 --> 26:30.806
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

26:30.980 --> 26:32.503
I'VE ALREADY
TOLD YOU.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.027
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.550
IT'S LEO'S TIME.

26:35.724 --> 26:38.509
I'LL GET WYATT
TO HEAL HIM SOMEHOW.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.381
HE'S NOT DEAD YET.

26:40.555 --> 26:43.079
NO, BUT HE
SOON WILL BE.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.081
YOU SAID THERE WAS
A REASON BEHIND THIS.

26:45.255 --> 26:47.649
THERE'S A REASON
BEHIND EVERYTHING.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.738
THAT'S WHY IT'S
CALLED THE GRAND DESIGN.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.740
BUT SPECIFICALLY THIS.
YOU MADE A POINT

26:51.914 --> 26:53.960
OF TELLING ME
THAT THERE WAS A REASON,

26:54.134 --> 26:55.962
JUST LIKE YOU MADE
A POINT OF WARNING ME

26:56.136 --> 26:57.920
IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.661
RIGHT.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.794
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO SAVE
LEO BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN'T.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.492
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO TELL ME WHO CAN.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.408
I NEED TO KNOW
WHY THIS IS HAPPENING,

27:07.582 --> 27:10.063
ESPECIALLY IF
IT WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.892
I'LL PULL
EVERY CONNECTION I HAVE

27:13.066 --> 27:16.112
IF YOU JUST POINT ME
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.985
YOU KNOW,

27:19.159 --> 27:21.030
I COULD GET IN A GREAT
DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THIS.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.905
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE GREATER REASON IS,

27:26.079 --> 27:27.820
BUT I DO KNOW
THERE IS ONE.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.039
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD SPEAK
TO THOSE WHO KNOW

27:30.213 --> 27:33.826
MORE ABOUT THE GRAND
DESIGN THAN I DO.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.180
THANK YOU.

27:47.143 --> 27:49.189
AN AVATAR?

27:49.363 --> 27:51.800
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO?

27:51.974 --> 27:54.368
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
MY HUSBAND'S LIFE...

27:54.542 --> 27:57.719
ANY WAY I CAN.

28:03.159 --> 28:04.421
THE VERY FACT
THAT YOU DARE PUT ME

28:04.595 --> 28:06.510
IN A ROOM
WITH AN AVATAR...

28:06.685 --> 28:08.599
SHOWS THE OPEN-MINDED VIEW
SHE IS CAPABLE OF HAVING.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.340
SAYS THE ONE
WHOSE SINGLE-MINDED BELIEFS

28:10.514 --> 28:11.907
NEARLY DESTROYED US ALL.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.083
[WHISTLES]
LISTEN.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.955
I AM ONLY INTERESTED
IN TALKING ABOUT LEO

28:16.129 --> 28:18.261
RIGHT NOW. AND I HAVE IT
ON VERY GOOD AUTHORITY

28:18.435 --> 28:20.916
THAT ONE OR BOTH
OF YOU CAN TELL ME

28:21.090 --> 28:22.657
WHY THIS IS HAPPENING.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.920
SO...I'M LISTENING.

28:25.094 --> 28:27.096
Elder: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.446
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT. LOOK,

28:29.620 --> 28:32.754
I DON'T CARE HOW IT HAPPENS.
I DON'T CARE WHO DOES IT,

28:32.928 --> 28:34.930
BUT ONE OF YOU
IS GOING TO SAVE LEO

28:35.104 --> 28:36.497
BECAUSE BOTH OF YOU OWE HIM.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.936
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU WON'T HEAL LEO?

28:42.329 --> 28:45.854
OR YOU, THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE THE POWER TO FIX THIS?

28:48.509 --> 28:50.859
WELL, SOMEBODY
SAY SOMETHING!

28:51.033 --> 28:53.906
IT'S NOT
THAT WE WON'T, PIPER.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.603
WE CAN'T.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.519
USING OUR POWERS
TO SAVE LEO,

28:58.693 --> 29:02.653
IT'S A PATH THAT NEITHER
ELDER NOR AVATAR CAN TRAVEL.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.481
HANG ON A SECOND.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.179
ARE YOU TELLING ME

29:06.353 --> 29:08.703
THAT THE FIRST TIME
YOU TWO AGREE ON ANYTHING

29:08.877 --> 29:11.358
IS WHEN YOU DECIDE
TO LET MY HUSBAND DIE?

29:14.100 --> 29:15.275
I DON'T THINK SO.

29:15.449 --> 29:16.406
I'M SORRY.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.321
NO. YOU LISTEN TO ME.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.454

IN HIS LIFE,

29:20.628 --> 29:21.934
BELIEVED IN
BOTH OF YOUR CAUSES.

29:22.108 --> 29:23.544
HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE

29:23.718 --> 29:25.372
AT THE EXPENSE
OF HIS FAMILY

29:25.546 --> 29:27.243
TO THOSE BELIEFS.

29:27.417 --> 29:31.334
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
YOU WON'T SAVE THAT LIFE?

29:31.508 --> 29:33.772
WHY THE HELL CAN'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:33.946 --> 29:35.643
WHAT IS YOUR BIG SECRET?

29:38.167 --> 29:42.781
WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION.

29:42.955 --> 29:45.261
FINE. WELL, IF YOU
DON'T, THEN WHO DOES?

29:45.435 --> 29:47.742
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO THINK TWICE

29:47.916 --> 29:48.917
BEFORE GOING THERE.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.789
GOING WHERE?

29:50.963 --> 29:53.400
YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED YOUR SISTERS.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.236
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

30:04.759 --> 30:05.586
HI.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.848
HI.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.589
SORRY I LEFT
WITHOUT TALKING BEFORE.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.634
I CAN'T
TALK NOW, SO...

30:10.809 --> 30:12.201
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I CAME FOR.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.855
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

30:14.029 --> 30:15.204
LOOK, I NEED SOME HELP.
IT'S ABOUT MY BROTHER-IN-LAW--

30:15.378 --> 30:16.597
HOLD IT. YOU CAN'T JUST
STORM OUT ON LUNCH

30:16.771 --> 30:17.946
AND THEN SHINE ME ON,

30:18.120 --> 30:19.730
THEN SHOW UP HERE
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.123
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
I DIDN'T.

30:21.297 --> 30:22.951
GOOD. LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHY YOU WERE UPSET.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.997
OK. HERE'S THE THING.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.695
I HAVE NO ISSUE, YOU KNOW,
GOING DUTCH WITH GUYS.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.437
I DO IT, YOU KNOW, A LOT.
TOTALLY FINE.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.308
BUT I GUESS
I JUST KIND OF FEEL--HEH--

30:32.482 --> 30:34.397
MAYBE IT'S OLD-FASHIONED--
THAT WHEN SOMEONE

30:34.571 --> 30:36.573
SPECIFICALLY ASKS ME
OUT ON A DATE THAT MAYBE--

30:36.747 --> 30:37.966
WHO DID THAT?

30:38.140 --> 30:39.315
YOU DID.
I--NO.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.056
YEAH. YOU SAID,

30:41.230 --> 30:44.712
"WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
FOR LUNCH ON A DATE?"

30:44.886 --> 30:47.846
I SAID, "WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO FOR LUNCH AT NATE'S?"

30:49.848 --> 30:52.285
OK. THAT'S
REALLY EMBARRASSING.

30:52.459 --> 30:55.331
THE EMBARRASSING PART
OF THE STORY IS THAT...

30:55.505 --> 30:57.377
I DID WANT TO
MAKE IT A DATE,

30:57.551 --> 31:00.032
AND I DIDN'T ASK YOU
BECAUSE I WAS SCARED

31:00.206 --> 31:01.511
YOU WERE GONNA SAY NO.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.035
HUH.

31:03.209 --> 31:04.732

31:04.906 --> 31:06.734

FOR YOU, PAIGE?

31:06.908 --> 31:08.257
HERE'S THE THING.

31:08.431 --> 31:10.694
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO SOMEBODY IN JAIL.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.002
THE CATCH IS, IT HAS
TO BE COMPLETELY PRIVATE

31:14.176 --> 31:16.178
AND YOU CAN'T ASK ME WHY.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.488
Henry: HOW EXACTLY IS
THIS GONNA HELP LEO AGAIN?

31:21.662 --> 31:23.577
HENRY, PLEASE STOP
FISHING.

31:23.751 --> 31:26.275
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:26.449 --> 31:28.364
WHO'S SHE, MY P.D.?

31:28.538 --> 31:30.062
THANKS, JACK.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.589
ALL RIGHT. NO ONE'S
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.634
THE CAMERAS ARE OFF.
HE'S ALL YOURS.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.114
THANK YOU.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.203
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.814
YEAH. I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, TOO, LADY.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.512
I MEAN, YOU'RE
A GREAT-LOOKING LAWYER

31:45.686 --> 31:47.514
AND ALL, BUT I GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.168
I'M NOT A LAWYER.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.084
OH, NO?
THEN WHAT ARE YOU?

31:52.258 --> 31:54.086
ACTUALLY...

31:54.260 --> 31:56.305
I'M A WITCH.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.481
[SHOUTING]

31:58.655 --> 32:00.875
[SHOUTING]

32:01.049 --> 32:03.530
WHAT THE HELL...

32:03.704 --> 32:05.184
WHERE ARE WE?

32:05.358 --> 32:06.968
HOW DID WE
GET HERE?

32:07.142 --> 32:08.883
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

32:09.057 --> 32:11.581
TRUTH POTION, LENNY.
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME

32:11.755 --> 32:14.889
WHAT'S GOING ON
AND WHO IS BEHIND THIS.

32:15.063 --> 32:17.196
BEHIND WHAT?

32:18.719 --> 32:19.850
HEY.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.986
HEY, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD.
WHAT WAS THAT STUFF?

32:25.160 --> 32:27.554
NEVER MIND.
THE TRUTH. NOW.

32:27.728 --> 32:30.905
ALL RIGHT. OK. THE TRUTH
IS, I DON'T REALLY HAVE

32:31.079 --> 32:32.951
A LICENSE
TO DRIVE A TOW.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.300
I FORGED IT. AND I'M NOT
REALLY FROM JERSEY.

32:34.474 --> 32:36.432
I'M FROM KANSAS.
I ONLY TOOK THE GIG--

32:36.606 --> 32:37.912
WHAT?
TO PAY BACK THE BOOKIE.

32:38.086 --> 32:39.696
AND I DIDN'T REALLY LOSE
THE MONEY. I STOLE IT.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.698
OF COURSE THAT'S AFTER
I SLEPT WITH HIS WIFE.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.266
NO. TELL ME
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.833
WHICH DEMON IS BEHIND THIS?

32:46.007 --> 32:48.270
DEMONS?
YOU WANT TO TALK DEMONS?

32:48.444 --> 32:49.750
YEAH.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.621
ALL RIGHT. I STOLE FROM
THE COLLECTION PLATE.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.014
AND EVEN THOUGH I
PROMISED TO RETURN

32:53.188 --> 32:54.624
THE MONEY,
I GAMBLED IT AWAY.

32:54.798 --> 32:55.974
WELL, ACTUALLY,

32:56.148 --> 32:57.627
I RIGGED THE GAME
AND MADE SOME DOUGH,

32:57.801 --> 32:59.151
AND THEN I LOST IT

32:59.325 --> 33:00.804
GOING OVER TO PAY
AT THE TRACK.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.763
PAIGE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:02.937 --> 33:04.895
THIS IS THE GUY
WHO CRASHED INTO LEO.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.288
ALTHOUGH I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK IT

33:06.462 --> 33:07.986
REALLY WAS AN ACCIDENT.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.858
IT WASN'T.
GET RID OF HIM.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.818
HMM. NOW, I WONDER
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

33:14.993 --> 33:16.472
IF I PUT THIS RIGHT HERE.

33:16.646 --> 33:19.127
NO. DON'T.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.216
JUST...PUT IT DOWN.

33:21.390 --> 33:22.217
PLEASE.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.002
IT'LL KILL ME. I SWEAR.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.047
HMM. MIGHT WANT TO
KEEP THAT IN MIND.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.484
SO I GUESS THAT MEANS
YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.399
Billie: ENOUGH TO START
ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.053
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

33:32.227 --> 33:34.447
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
I JUST DO AS I'M TOLD.

33:34.621 --> 33:35.883
YOU'RE LYING.
YOU KNEW WHO I WAS.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.319
YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY SISTER.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.192
NOW TELL US WHO HIRED
YOU OR YOU'RE DEAD.

33:40.366 --> 33:42.107
UH-OH.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.631
"UH-OH" WHAT?

33:48.374 --> 33:49.723
YOU KNOW,
A PHONE CALL

33:49.897 --> 33:51.203
WOULD HAVE
DONE THE TRICK.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.682
WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.423
AND SO IS LEO.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.612
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE WE SURE

34:09.786 --> 34:11.223
WE KNOW WHAT
WE'RE DOING HERE?

34:11.397 --> 34:13.051
PHOEBE.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.574
PIPER, I WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO SAVE LEO. YOU KNOW THAT,

34:14.748 --> 34:16.228
BUT THIS IS JUST FREAKING ME
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.186
I MEAN, HAS ANYONE EVER
DONE THIS BEFORE?

34:18.360 --> 34:20.319
Paige: WELL, WE'VE MET
THE ANGEL OF DESTINY BEFORE.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.060
Phoebe: I KNOW, BUT
WE'VE NEVER SUMMONED HIM.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.453
HE CAME TO US,
OK? I'M JUST SAYING.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.542
PHOEBE, I CAN'T LOSE LEO.
I WON'T.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.508
Piper: POWER OF THREE
WE SUMMON THEE,

34:35.682 --> 34:39.599
AND CALL TO US
THE ANGEL OF DESTINY.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.736
WHO ARE YOU
TO SUMMON ME?

34:46.910 --> 34:48.129
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE THE ONE

34:48.303 --> 34:50.044
WE MET BEFORE.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.655
THERE ARE MANY DESTINIES
AND MANY ANGELS.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.483
DO YOU KNOW
WHY WE CALLED YOU?

34:54.657 --> 34:56.964
YES, THOUGH THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU.

34:57.138 --> 34:58.444
THIS IS LEO'S DESTINY.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.359
WHY? WHO SAYS?

35:00.533 --> 35:01.708
WHO DO YOU THINK?

35:01.882 --> 35:03.057
Phoebe: DON'T GO THERE.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.493
LISTEN, LADY.
I'VE JUMPED

35:04.667 --> 35:05.929
THROUGH A LOT OF HOOPS
TO GET YOU HERE,

35:06.104 --> 35:07.975
AND I WANT SOME ANSWERS,
AND I MEAN FAST.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.324
EASY, PIPER.

35:09.498 --> 35:12.371
Piper: THIS WAS NOT
ANY RANDOM ACCIDENT.

35:12.545 --> 35:13.763
THERE'S MORE
TO IT THAN THAT,

35:13.937 --> 35:15.156
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT.

35:15.330 --> 35:16.723
WHO SAYS THERE'S MORE?

35:16.897 --> 35:18.203
THE ANGEL OF DEATH.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.291
AND AN ELDER.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.466
AND AN AVATAR.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.902
LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING
TO HAVE

35:22.076 --> 35:23.556
TO HAVE A LITTLE
CHAT WITH THEM.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.514
FIRST YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT

35:25.688 --> 35:26.950
WITH ME. NOW,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

35:27.125 --> 35:28.517
THIS WHOLE GRAND
DESIGN THING,

35:28.691 --> 35:30.040
NOR DO I WANT TO,

35:30.215 --> 35:32.086
BUT IF YOUR ONLY CONCERN
IS WHERE WE END UP,

35:32.260 --> 35:34.044
ISN'T IT UP TO US,

35:34.219 --> 35:36.090
WITH FREE WILL AND ALL,
HOW WE GET THERE?

35:36.264 --> 35:37.831
GO ON.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.441
JUST EXPLAIN TO ME

35:39.615 --> 35:41.400
WHY LEO IS DESTINED
TO DIE RIGHT NOW.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.490
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
FOR THE WHOLE BIG PICTURE?

35:44.664 --> 35:48.494
BECAUSE MAYBE THERE IS
A WAY FOR US TO GET THERE...

35:48.668 --> 35:50.800
THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DIE.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.021
YOU HAVE
TO GIVE US A CHANCE.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.588
YOU AT LEAST OWE US THAT.

36:05.075 --> 36:08.209
THERE'S ONE MORE BATTLE ON
THE HORIZON FOR YOU THREE--

36:08.383 --> 36:10.951
ONE UNLIKE YOU'VE
EVER FACED BEFORE,

36:11.125 --> 36:13.040
ONE YOU WON'T SEE COMING,

36:13.214 --> 36:16.174
AND ONE...YOU MAY
NOT SURVIVE.

36:17.653 --> 36:20.090
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH LEO?

36:20.265 --> 36:23.616
THE LOSS, THE PAIN
WILL MOTIVATE YOU,

36:23.790 --> 36:25.226
ALL OF YOU, TO FIGHT,

36:25.400 --> 36:27.663
WITHOUT WHICH YOU WILL
HAVE NO CHANCE TO PREVAIL.

36:27.837 --> 36:31.014
Phoebe: WON'T YOU PLEASE
TRY TO LET US FIND

36:31.189 --> 36:33.234
A WAY TO DO THIS
WITHOUT LEO DYING?

36:34.975 --> 36:37.369
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

36:46.378 --> 36:48.510
MY SISTER,
IS SHE ALIVE OR NOT?

36:48.684 --> 36:50.599
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.166
I'LL TALK.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.429
BILLIE, WAIT.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.605
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

36:56.779 --> 36:58.041
WHO'S THAT?

36:58.216 --> 36:59.608
SOMEONE
THAT CAN SAVE LEO.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.262
BUT WE'RE GONNA
NEED HIS HELP.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.569
Piper: WE DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

37:03.743 --> 37:06.136
LEO'S ABOUT TO DIE
ANY SECOND,

37:06.311 --> 37:08.791
AND THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY
WE COULD THINK OF TO SAVE HIM.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.140
HOW?

37:11.751 --> 37:14.971
BY DOING TO LEO WHAT
HE DOES TO HIS TROPHIES--

37:15.145 --> 37:16.669
FREEZING HIM.

37:16.843 --> 37:20.150
BUT THAT'S ONLY IF
I AGREE TO HELP. RIGHT?

37:20.325 --> 37:21.935
I MEAN, BLONDIE HERE

37:22.109 --> 37:23.284
KNOWS HOW TO TORTURE,
ALL RIGHT.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.894
BUT SHE CAN'T
FREEZE ANYONE.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.374
Paige: WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

37:26.548 --> 37:29.899
IT'S A LITTLE THING
CALLED AMNESTY.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.685
YOU DON'T COME AFTER ME.
YOU DON'T TOUCH ME.

37:32.859 --> 37:36.123
I'M COMPLETELY FREE.
AND I DON'T HAVE TO TALK

37:36.297 --> 37:38.560
TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE
ABOUT HER SISTER.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.823
Billie: NO, YOU CAN'T DO
THIS. HE KNOWS SOMETHING.

37:40.997 --> 37:42.303
Piper:
I KNOW, SWEETIE, I KNOW.

37:42.477 --> 37:44.914
AND I SWEAR WE'LL FIND
YOUR SISTER, I PROMISE.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.395
BUT THIS
IS LEO'S ONLY HOPE.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.575
OK.

37:53.749 --> 37:54.881
DEAL?

37:58.406 --> 37:59.755
GO AHEAD.

38:10.592 --> 38:13.203
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:13.378 --> 38:14.553
WHERE AM I?

38:17.947 --> 38:20.167
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.952
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS YOU'RE GONNA BE SAFE.

38:23.126 --> 38:25.172
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:26.956 --> 38:30.395
REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU
YOU JUST HAD TO TRUST ME?

38:30.569 --> 38:32.571
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.268
THE ONLY WAY?

38:36.052 --> 38:37.532
PIPER...

38:37.706 --> 38:41.841
I HAVE TO LOSE YOU
TO SAVE YOU.

38:42.015 --> 38:45.323
IT'S JUST
OUR SCREWED-UP DESTINY,

38:45.497 --> 38:48.717

CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.937
I'M SO SORRY.

38:53.505 --> 38:56.421
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I, UH--

38:56.595 --> 38:58.074
WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH WORSE.

38:59.772 --> 39:00.947
NO.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.601
WE HAVEN'T.

39:02.775 --> 39:05.691
WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.873
OF COURSE WE WILL.

HE WILL BE RETURNED.

DIDN'T I?
