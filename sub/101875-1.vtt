00:26.794 --> 00:27.895
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

00:27.929 --> 00:30.998
<i>there was a great war
that devastated the land.</i>

00:32.432 --> 00:35.002
<i>And when the arms were
finally laid down,</i>

00:35.036 --> 00:37.939
<i>many a million had been
slaughtered and broken,</i>

00:38.773 --> 00:40.340
<i>lost and gone forever.</i>

00:44.011 --> 00:46.614
<i>The people decided to
overthrow their kings</i>

00:47.081 --> 00:49.851
<i>and to split the lands
equally amongst everyone.</i>

00:51.619 --> 00:53.487
<i>Yet, not everyone was equal.</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:57.024
<i>Soon, new kings arose,</i>

00:57.058 --> 01:00.027
<i>some good and just, some not.</i>

01:03.363 --> 01:05.465
<i>When one of the just kings died,</i>

01:05.499 --> 01:08.035
<i>he handed his kingdom
to his three sons,</i>

01:08.069 --> 01:10.772
<i>Dormant, Dunstan, and Drake</i>

01:10.805 --> 01:12.907
<i>for them to share the
burden of the crown.</i>

01:13.841 --> 01:16.309
<i>At first, the three young kings</i>

01:16.343 --> 01:19.046
<i>ruled fairly and
well, side by side.</i>

01:22.349 --> 01:24.852
<i>But Dormant grew jealous
of his younger brothers</i>

01:24.886 --> 01:27.054
<i>and decided to take
their shares for himself.</i>

01:28.723 --> 01:30.290
<i>He swiftly had them killed.</i>

01:31.826 --> 01:35.029
<i>Without his brothers,
Dormant became a tyrant.</i>

01:37.430 --> 01:40.333
<i>He surrounded himself
with cruel counselors</i>

01:40.367 --> 01:41.903
<i>and ruthless minions</i>

01:41.936 --> 01:44.471
<i>and exploited the
lands and the people.</i>

01:47.574 --> 01:51.913
<i>One day, King Dormant came
across an old bent over man</i>

01:51.946 --> 01:54.414
<i>who sat in front of an
old bent over house.</i>

01:56.651 --> 01:58.820
<i>The old man's name was Hobbes</i>

01:58.853 --> 02:01.555
<i>and the king decided he would
take the old man's house</i>

02:01.589 --> 02:02.790
<i>and its lands.</i>

02:04.091 --> 02:05.626
<i>Old Hobbes was killed</i>

02:05.660 --> 02:07.829
<i>and his house was
razed to the ground.</i>

02:09.429 --> 02:12.767
<i>But old Hobbes was a
powerful and wise witcher,</i>

02:12.800 --> 02:15.069
<i>and with his dying
breath, he spoke a curse.</i>

02:16.604 --> 02:18.139
<i>All in the line of King Dormant</i>

02:18.172 --> 02:20.440
<i>and all who belong to his land</i>

02:20.473 --> 02:22.643
<i>shall be bound in service to it</i>

02:22.677 --> 02:26.346
<i>as its protectors and
guardians, in life and death.</i>

02:27.380 --> 02:30.417
<i>King Dormant laughed in
the face of the curse</i>

02:30.450 --> 02:33.788
<i>and built a new house and
called it Hobbes House,</i>

02:33.821 --> 02:35.723
<i>to spite the old witcher.</i>

02:36.123 --> 02:41.128
<i>But not long after, the king
fell ill and perished in agony.</i>

02:42.196 --> 02:46.601
<i>All the while, the house
stood strong for generations</i>

02:46.634 --> 02:49.469
<i>with the king's descendants
as its protectors.</i>

02:50.171 --> 02:52.773
<i>This is our family's legacy.</i>

02:54.541 --> 02:55.610
We're fucking lost.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.711
Nonsense.

02:56.744 --> 02:57.645
Where are we then?

02:58.179 --> 02:59.580
The old graveyard.

03:00.715 --> 03:02.149
There's a family
crypt here somewhere.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.553
Plenty of developers will be
scrambling over this property.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.922
Heritage always sells.

03:08.789 --> 03:12.159
Our profits will triple,
quadruple, we'll be killing it,

03:12.193 --> 03:14.629
as long as everyone
plays their part.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.663
All right?

03:20.234 --> 03:21.168
Jacob.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.638
Jacob, where are you?

03:27.909 --> 03:29.043
This isn't funny.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.879
Hello?

03:37.084 --> 03:40.721
Jacob, what the fuck?

04:31.305 --> 04:32.907
Naser.

04:33.506 --> 04:36.177
I'm sorry, Miss Alex, I
did not mean to scare you.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.219
I'm very tired, Miss Alex.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.756
Okay, shouldn't I read
you something new,

04:48.789 --> 04:50.523
perhaps from the papers?

04:52.226 --> 04:53.928
I won't be here much longer.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.197
Are you planning a
journey, Miss Alex?

04:58.199 --> 05:00.868
It's all right,
Naser, I'm exhausted.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.739
I'll do my rounds then.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.310
It's all in here, Naser.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.979
Don't forget, even
when I'm gone.

05:12.013 --> 05:15.216
The mind is a blade,
it requires sharpening.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.549
Knowledge is...

05:16.584 --> 05:18.219
Knowledge is power, I know.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.189
Exactly.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.325
Always remember the
story of the guardians.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.192
I will.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.795
Good night, Miss Alex.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.662
Good night.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.768
And Naser?

05:35.770 --> 05:37.238
Thank you.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.779
<i>And just as
Hobbes, the witcher,</i>

05:44.812 --> 05:46.180
<i>had pronounced it,</i>

05:46.213 --> 05:48.082
<i>in death, as in life,</i>

05:48.115 --> 05:49.316
<i>the guardians of Hobbes House</i>

05:49.350 --> 05:52.019
<i>will be bound by the curse.</i>

05:58.926 --> 06:00.127
<i>When their home is threatened,</i>

06:00.161 --> 06:03.831
<i>the guardians will rise to
hunt and torment the living.</i>

06:11.939 --> 06:13.974
<i>They shall no longer be human.</i>

06:14.008 --> 06:15.843
<i>They shall no longer be dead.</i>

06:25.319 --> 06:27.688
<i>But they will have
become one with the land.</i>

06:31.959 --> 06:34.929
<i>They shall not sleep
and they shall not rest.</i>

06:35.329 --> 06:37.131
<i>They shall neither
love nor hate.</i>

06:39.733 --> 06:42.069
They will only hunger for
the warmth of the living.

06:47.108 --> 06:49.310
<i>Their touch will be so cold</i>

06:49.343 --> 06:50.778
<i>it will freeze a man's heart.</i>

07:02.389 --> 07:05.659
<i>Only by coming together in
unity may they be stopped.</i>

07:08.395 --> 07:11.632
<i>Only unity can keep you safe.</i>

08:26.440 --> 08:27.441
<i>Hey
Jane, this is Mand.</i>

08:27.474 --> 08:29.443
<i>Yeah, uh listen, it's
not working out love</i>

08:29.476 --> 08:31.779
<i>so don't bother coming in.</i>

08:31.812 --> 08:32.880
<i>Just come round the pub sometime</i>

08:32.913 --> 08:34.014
<i>to pick up your
wages, all right?</i>

08:34.048 --> 08:35.716
<i>Have a nice life, bye.</i>

09:47.488 --> 09:48.422
Ugh.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.307
Hello?

10:06.340 --> 10:07.374
<i>Oh good morning.</i>

10:07.408 --> 10:08.542
<i>Am I speaking to Jane Dormant?</i>

10:09.410 --> 10:10.311
Who's this?

10:10.344 --> 10:11.912
<i>My name is Eury Saul.</i>

10:11.945 --> 10:13.247
<i>I'm a solicitor.</i>

10:13.280 --> 10:14.848
<i>We had an appointment yesterday.</i>

10:14.882 --> 10:16.584
<i>It's about your
aunt, Miss Dormant.</i>

10:16.618 --> 10:19.019
<i>Your aunt is Alexandra Dormant?</i>

10:19.053 --> 10:21.522
Yes, but we didn't
have an appointment.

10:21.555 --> 10:22.523
<i>Well, my
assistant told me</i>

10:22.556 --> 10:24.158
<i>she talked to you last week.</i>

10:27.629 --> 10:29.063
Oh shit.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.364
I mean, I'm sorry,

10:32.166 --> 10:34.535
there's a lot going
on at the moment.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.505
<i>Um, I didn't
mean to do this</i>

10:38.539 --> 10:40.341
<i>over the phone, Miss Dormant,</i>

10:40.374 --> 10:43.578
<i>but I'm afraid I
have some bad news.</i>

10:44.912 --> 10:46.648
<i>We did try to
contact you sooner,</i>

10:46.681 --> 10:48.549
<i>but had some
trouble finding you.</i>

10:50.517 --> 10:51.452
I've moved a lot.

10:52.587 --> 10:53.588
<i>I see.</i>

10:55.923 --> 10:59.560
<i>I'm so sorry but
Alex, but your aunt,</i>

10:59.594 --> 11:01.462
<i>passed away three weeks ago.</i>

11:02.529 --> 11:03.530
<i>It was an accident.</i>

11:04.932 --> 11:06.467
<i>Your aunt did leave a will.</i>

11:06.500 --> 11:09.503
<i>It's only to be opened in the
presence of her beneficiaries.</i>

11:12.072 --> 11:14.609
<i>This must all be very
upsetting for you</i>

11:14.642 --> 11:15.744
<i>but the thing is, Miss Dormant,</i>

11:15.777 --> 11:18.580
<i>the reading of the will
was supposed to take place</i>

11:18.613 --> 11:20.582
<i>this afternoon at Hobbes House.</i>

11:20.615 --> 11:23.150
<i>I'm sure we can
reschedule if need be.</i>

11:25.953 --> 11:27.955
<i>Miss Dormant, are
you still there?</i>

11:31.091 --> 11:33.394
Yeah sorry, I um...

11:35.462 --> 11:37.164
Let's keep the
appointment as it is,

11:37.197 --> 11:38.633
I can be at the
house this afternoon.

11:50.645 --> 11:53.180
Alex, I'm so sorry.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.291
Nice car.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.760
Oh, you know how it goes,

13:45.793 --> 13:47.427
the more expensive it looks,

13:47.461 --> 13:49.062
the more high maintenance it is.

13:50.665 --> 13:52.700
Miss Dormant, I'm Eury Saul,

13:52.734 --> 13:54.501
we spoke on the
phone this morning.

13:55.536 --> 13:56.336
Shall we go in?

14:18.425 --> 14:20.795
If you need a few moments
to collect your thoughts,

14:20.828 --> 14:23.297
I can wait for you in the study.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.799
We can proceed
when you're ready.

14:25.700 --> 14:29.436
What kind of accident
did Alex have exactly?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.171
When did you last see your aunt?

14:32.707 --> 14:33.641
A few years ago.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.846
She wasn't well and hadn't
been for quite some time.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.449
She'd become a bit of a
recluse and was depressed.

14:43.751 --> 14:46.520
At the end, she'd let
go of all of her staff,

14:46.553 --> 14:47.822
except for her groundskeeper.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.559
But what does this have
to do with her accident?

14:52.594 --> 14:56.764
Your aunt suffered a
rather dark episode.

14:56.798 --> 14:58.800
I'm afraid she
took her own life.

15:01.836 --> 15:03.771
When was the funeral?

15:03.805 --> 15:06.674
On the 31st of January,
I attended myself.

15:07.942 --> 15:09.476
Alex and I,

15:09.509 --> 15:11.846
your aunt and I,
we were friends.

15:12.880 --> 15:16.516
She's buried in the family
crypt if you'd like to visit.

15:18.853 --> 15:20.253
Are you sure it was a suicide?

15:21.723 --> 15:23.858
Look, I know this is a lot
to take in, Miss Dormant,

15:23.891 --> 15:25.559
if you need some time...

15:27.795 --> 15:29.262
Time doesn't change anything.

15:31.933 --> 15:35.837
The groundskeeper, is it still
the old German guy, Helmut?

15:35.870 --> 15:37.805
He smokes like a chimney.

15:37.839 --> 15:39.573
He must be a 100
years old by now.

15:40.742 --> 15:43.578
He survived Alex,
who would've thought?

15:45.947 --> 15:47.615
Oh, who are you?

15:47.649 --> 15:49.917
I'm Naser, hello.

15:49.951 --> 15:51.753
Since Mr. Schmidt's passing

15:51.786 --> 15:54.187
Naser has been taking
care of his duties.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.222
Pleased to meet you.

15:57.659 --> 15:59.159
Look who the cat dragged in.

16:00.962 --> 16:02.362
Jennifer?

16:02.396 --> 16:04.632
I go by Janny now, it
gets me more followers.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.834
You're here?

16:07.835 --> 16:08.870
I <i>was</i> invited.

16:09.971 --> 16:12.974
Your aunt was very clear
on that particular point.

16:13.007 --> 16:17.210
She wanted her next of kin
and Mr. Mohammedan present

16:17.244 --> 16:18.512
at the reading of her will.

16:23.283 --> 16:23.918
Jesus, Jane.

16:25.987 --> 16:27.287
Who are you?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.790
Name is Nigel Thatcher.

16:28.823 --> 16:30.490
I'm Janny's partner.

16:30.524 --> 16:31.592
Pleasure to meet you.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.662
I think you owe your
sister some gratitude.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.364
You don't know what I
owe my half sister.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.267
I'm just saying she
took care of everything,

16:40.300 --> 16:41.869
the funeral, the
wake, everything

16:41.903 --> 16:43.705
and that's all while
still running her vlog.

16:43.738 --> 16:44.471
Don't, babe.

16:45.106 --> 16:46.874
No one ever talked to
you like that darling.

16:46.908 --> 16:47.942
I know it's
none of my business,

16:47.975 --> 16:49.911
but we were very fond of Alex.

16:49.944 --> 16:50.878
We called her every week

16:50.912 --> 16:52.747
and came to see her
as often as we could.

16:53.114 --> 16:54.381
You're right,

16:54.414 --> 16:55.583
I don't know anything about you

16:55.616 --> 16:57.517
or your relationship
with your aunt,

16:57.551 --> 16:59.787
but let's all try and
get some closure today.

17:01.856 --> 17:03.256
Fine.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.425
Right, I'm all set
up in the study.

17:17.605 --> 17:22.043
"To my nieces, Jane
and Jennifer Dormant,

17:22.076 --> 17:24.812
"and to my trusted dear
friend, Naser Mohammedan.

17:25.780 --> 17:28.950
"When you read this, I will
no longer be with you.

17:33.054 --> 17:35.288
"For whatever lies ahead,

17:35.322 --> 17:39.060
"you must always remember
that knowledge is power."

17:39.093 --> 17:40.962
Oh God.

17:41.629 --> 17:43.563
What?

17:45.700 --> 17:47.068
Your little show.

17:47.101 --> 17:48.703
My show?

17:48.736 --> 17:50.037
Janny.

17:50.071 --> 17:51.706
Are you saying I'm fake?

17:51.739 --> 17:54.008
Well what else would you
call those crocodile tears?

17:54.709 --> 17:57.011
You're seriously
doing this right now?

17:58.012 --> 17:59.379
I just find it a bit of a waste.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.015
There's no one here
for you to impress.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.316
Oh, you're so full of it.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.051
How dare you?

18:04.752 --> 18:07.387
- Janny, please.
- No, I won't.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.023
Didn't I tell you she
was an utter dimwit?

18:10.357 --> 18:11.759
I tell you what Janny,

18:11.793 --> 18:13.594
why don't you take
your fake attitude,

18:13.628 --> 18:15.395
your lies and your
privileged little life

18:15.428 --> 18:16.964
and go and fuck yourself?

18:16.998 --> 18:19.366
Go back to bloody Berlin
to your fucking father

18:19.399 --> 18:21.936
and that thieving witch
you call a mother.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.111
Oh, Jane Dormant,

18:30.144 --> 18:32.079
queen of the dramatic exit.

18:32.113 --> 18:34.514
Good riddance,
sister, see you never.

18:43.991 --> 18:45.660
I'll go and make the tea.

18:53.034 --> 18:53.868
What was that?

18:55.136 --> 18:56.103
I don't know.

18:56.137 --> 18:59.406
If she leaves, the whole
thing is out the window.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.074
I'm sorry.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.878
It's her, she always knew
how to push my buttons.

19:03.911 --> 19:05.646
You have
to go after her.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.513
What?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.015
Why?

19:08.049 --> 19:10.051
You're the only one who can
convince her not to leave.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.098
What a nightmare, hey?

19:24.131 --> 19:26.767
It's hard to believe
they're related to Alex.

19:29.103 --> 19:32.707
Well, what can you do
with people like Jane?

19:32.740 --> 19:35.610
In my experience, it's all
misguided expectations.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.948
Everything will be
just fine, Miss Saul,

19:40.982 --> 19:42.817
as long as everyone
plays their part.

19:48.990 --> 19:51.058
What a bunch of assholes.

20:28.863 --> 20:29.797
This is your car?

20:31.098 --> 20:31.999
Fuck off.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.168
Wait a second, are you
living in this thing?

20:34.201 --> 20:35.636
I said, fuck off.

20:37.605 --> 20:38.773
Listen, I'm sorry.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.209
What are you sorry
for? It's life.

20:42.243 --> 20:44.511
I lost a mother too
when she died, you know?

20:46.013 --> 20:47.848
Yeah well you got another
one, I got the boot.

20:47.882 --> 20:48.849
That wasn't my decision.

20:52.286 --> 20:54.155
Let's not do this again, please.

20:59.894 --> 21:01.829
How's the tea coming along?

21:01.862 --> 21:02.697
Fine.

21:08.235 --> 21:10.237
You're from Syria,
is that right?

21:12.606 --> 21:13.240
Good tea there?

21:14.875 --> 21:16.210
Yes, very good tea.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.248
Look, what happened
earlier in the study,

21:21.282 --> 21:22.650
siblings, am I right?

21:23.550 --> 21:24.752
Siblings?

21:24.785 --> 21:27.655
You know brothers, and sisters.

21:27.688 --> 21:30.091
Yes, they fight sometimes.

21:31.225 --> 21:32.960
I have two brothers
and two sisters.

21:32.994 --> 21:34.195
We fought all the time.

21:34.829 --> 21:36.197
When was the last
time you saw them?

21:37.898 --> 21:39.266
Three years ago.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.168
Perhaps you'll see
them again soon.

21:42.136 --> 21:44.672
I can't imagine what
it must be like for you

21:44.705 --> 21:47.675
all alone so far from home.

21:48.876 --> 21:51.145
I might know someone
who can get you home.

21:54.248 --> 21:56.283
I just want to be
your friend Naser.

22:00.588 --> 22:02.790
In return, I want you to tell me

22:02.823 --> 22:05.259
exactly what happened
the night Alex died.

22:06.894 --> 22:08.963
I told the police what happened.

22:08.996 --> 22:09.830
Ah, yes.

22:12.867 --> 22:14.969
"She shot herself,

22:15.002 --> 22:17.004
I came running into the study,

22:17.038 --> 22:19.206
I saw her lying there,

22:19.240 --> 22:20.808
I applied first aid,

22:21.675 --> 22:23.310
I was a nurse in Syria,

22:24.345 --> 22:26.647
and then I called the police."

22:28.015 --> 22:31.652
It says here they couldn't
find a suicide note.

23:41.989 --> 23:43.657
Oh come on.

23:48.496 --> 23:51.265
There's still something that
doesn't make sense to me.

23:53.334 --> 23:56.170
Why would Alex include
<i>you</i> in her will?

23:57.438 --> 23:58.939
To be honest, Naser,

23:58.973 --> 24:00.808
the police around here
aren't the smartest.

24:00.841 --> 24:02.309
I've dealt with them before.

24:02.343 --> 24:06.881
They're simply not cut out for
suicide or fraud or murder.

24:09.383 --> 24:11.352
Luckily, I've got
some good contacts

24:11.385 --> 24:12.853
at Scotland Yard, you know?

24:14.288 --> 24:16.357
They'll be able to shed
some light on the matter

24:16.390 --> 24:19.093
and figure out what
really happened to Alex.

24:20.895 --> 24:22.696
Perhaps I'll make a few calls.

24:23.397 --> 24:24.732
What do you think?

24:26.500 --> 24:29.670
Yeah, perhaps you
should, Mr. Nigel.

24:48.022 --> 24:49.723
Don't leave like this.

24:55.796 --> 24:57.364
A blackout?

24:57.398 --> 24:58.766
Good thinking, 99.

25:01.368 --> 25:03.837
Perhaps we should go check
everyone's all right.

25:04.939 --> 25:05.773
Jane?

25:09.510 --> 25:10.744
Better be worth it.

25:14.081 --> 25:15.316
Are you coming?

25:36.503 --> 25:38.205
Perhaps
it's the power line.

25:41.475 --> 25:42.743
What was that?

25:47.081 --> 25:49.149
It's nothing to worry
about, Mr. Nigel.

26:02.429 --> 26:03.497
It's just the wind, see?

26:13.974 --> 26:16.010
What the hell?

26:16.043 --> 26:17.144
We found her like this.

26:17.177 --> 26:18.512
Hello?

26:18.545 --> 26:20.114
Hello, Miss Saul?

26:20.147 --> 26:22.416
Hello, Miss Saul,
can you hear me?

26:22.449 --> 26:23.984
Miss Saul, can you hear me?

26:26.487 --> 26:28.122
You call an ambulance.

26:28.155 --> 26:30.090
Get the blanket, we
need to cover her.

26:30.124 --> 26:31.425
I can't find a signal.

26:31.626 --> 26:32.359
Me neither.

26:34.295 --> 26:35.296
Miss Saul?

26:37.564 --> 26:38.832
Miss Saul!

26:38.866 --> 26:40.301
The line is dead.

26:40.334 --> 26:41.502
Let's just take it to the car.

26:41.535 --> 26:42.469
Take her to the
hospital ourselves.

26:42.503 --> 26:44.606
No, no, we could hurt
her if we move her.

26:44.639 --> 26:46.240
She might die if we don't.

26:50.544 --> 26:53.847
Okay, we use the
blanket as a stretcher.

26:53.881 --> 26:55.249
Here, let me show you.

27:08.896 --> 27:09.963
Open the car door.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.101
It's locked.

27:14.535 --> 27:16.503
Hold on, just
check her pockets.

27:17.371 --> 27:18.640
I can't find her keys.

27:18.673 --> 27:19.607
Take her.

27:19.641 --> 27:20.574
We'll take my car.

27:21.676 --> 27:23.143
Did you look properly?

27:25.512 --> 27:27.348
We're running out
of time here, Jane.

27:33.621 --> 27:34.656
We have to hurry.

27:34.689 --> 27:36.557
- Come on.
- Get this thing going.

27:39.259 --> 27:40.527
Okay.

27:42.396 --> 27:44.331
Got it, got it, got it.

27:50.204 --> 27:52.906
Don't do this to me now,
you rusty excuse of a car.

27:55.376 --> 27:57.544
Oh for god's sake.

28:00.247 --> 28:01.248
Turn that
bloody noise off!

28:26.006 --> 28:26.641
That's it.

28:26.907 --> 28:28.542
What do
you mean that's it?

28:28.576 --> 28:30.077
Jesus christ, Jennifer,

28:30.110 --> 28:31.178
your sister's wrecked
her bloody car.

28:31.211 --> 28:32.112
I knew I should've driven.

28:32.146 --> 28:33.947
Open the bonnet, please.

28:33.981 --> 28:34.649
Where are you going?

28:34.682 --> 28:36.283
Make sure you keep her head up.

28:37.719 --> 28:38.919
What a fucking joke.

28:42.657 --> 28:43.658
Don't leave

28:43.691 --> 28:44.558
me with her.

28:44.958 --> 28:45.693
You'll be fine, sis.

28:47.261 --> 28:49.463
Probably the cooler,
perhaps the pistons.

28:49.496 --> 28:50.598
Can you fix it?

28:50.632 --> 28:52.433
No, Nigel the
piston's have seized.

28:52.466 --> 28:53.735
English please.

28:53.768 --> 28:55.102
My car's
fucked, all right,

28:55.135 --> 28:56.704
the bloody car is fucked.

28:56.738 --> 28:58.172
Nigel.

28:58.205 --> 28:59.106
Calm down, no need
to yell like that.

28:59.139 --> 29:00.574
Don't tell me what to do.

29:00.608 --> 29:01.141
Guys?

29:01.175 --> 29:03.010
It's my car, all right?

29:03.043 --> 29:05.312
Jane, it's Saul, I
think she's dead.

29:05.345 --> 29:06.180
What?

29:09.016 --> 29:09.651
Miss Saul?

29:11.719 --> 29:12.519
Miss Saul?

29:12.553 --> 29:13.387
Hello Miss Saul?

29:14.087 --> 29:15.623
Miss Saul, can you hear me?

29:16.591 --> 29:18.225
Hello Miss Saul,
can you hear me?

29:27.468 --> 29:28.202
She just stopped breathing.

29:40.648 --> 29:41.716
Wait here.

30:23.625 --> 30:24.792
We couldn't save her.

30:30.665 --> 30:32.332
I saw something in
the woods, a shadow,

30:32.366 --> 30:33.735
I think it was watching me.

30:34.568 --> 30:37.571
Don't worry darling.

30:37.605 --> 30:39.641
We have to go back
to the house now.

30:45.145 --> 30:48.148
What about the dead
lawyer on my back seat?

30:48.181 --> 30:49.449
What are you doing?

30:49.483 --> 30:50.551
I'm locking the car.

30:50.585 --> 30:51.619
We have to secure it.

30:54.121 --> 30:55.222
Is that
your old Walkman?

30:55.857 --> 30:57.625
Who's gonna steal
this old banger?

30:57.659 --> 30:58.860
No offense.

30:58.893 --> 31:00.762
Whatever. Can I
have my keys back?

31:00.795 --> 31:02.630
Yes, but we have to go
back to the house now.

31:02.664 --> 31:04.565
Please, come on,
let's hurry, come on.

31:19.881 --> 31:22.182
I take it you
aren't expecting visitors?

31:28.455 --> 31:29.691
What's he doing?

31:29.724 --> 31:30.625
I have no idea.

31:32.727 --> 31:33.795
Looks like this
isn't the first time

31:33.828 --> 31:35.128
the lights have gone out.

31:40.835 --> 31:43.370
Is it just me or is
Naser acting a bit weird?

31:43.570 --> 31:45.840
Perhaps it's his PTSD.

31:45.873 --> 31:47.374
PTSD?

31:47.407 --> 31:49.844
Aunt Alex said it's
from his time in Syria.

31:51.211 --> 31:52.145
So he's a nutter.

31:52.847 --> 31:54.816
You're kidding, right?

31:54.849 --> 31:56.350
Aunt Alex took
him in a year ago.

31:56.383 --> 31:57.919
There were never any issues.

31:57.952 --> 31:58.853
She really liked him.

32:00.722 --> 32:03.156
Yeah, but why do we have
to deal with his problem?

32:03.190 --> 32:04.759
We've got enough of our own.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.894
So fucking hypocritical.

32:08.462 --> 32:11.565
Janny, you've got to
admit it's all a bit odd.

32:11.599 --> 32:13.200
Alex takes her own life

32:13.233 --> 32:16.370
after adding a complete stranger
to her will and now Saul.

32:16.403 --> 32:17.705
There's something going on here.

32:17.739 --> 32:19.373
So you're saying that
Naser killed Alex

32:19.406 --> 32:20.775
and somehow got away with it?

32:20.808 --> 32:23.443
Look, you said it yourself,
he's acting weirdly.

32:23.477 --> 32:26.279
All I'm saying is
we don't know him

32:26.313 --> 32:30.183
yet he has the keys and he
knows his way around the house.

32:30.217 --> 32:32.519
And he knows that there's
a shotgun in the cellar.

32:34.354 --> 32:37.557
- He might snap and go for us.
- Jesus christ, seriously?

32:37.592 --> 32:39.694
We shouldn't let our guard down.

32:39.727 --> 32:40.828
That's all I'm saying.

32:42.229 --> 32:43.330
Where is he anyway?

32:48.836 --> 32:49.671
Naser?

32:52.372 --> 32:53.173
Naser?

32:55.275 --> 32:57.879
Stop shouting, please,
you'll wake the dead.

32:57.912 --> 32:58.746
What are you doing?

32:58.780 --> 32:59.947
The candles.

33:04.819 --> 33:05.519
Stop that!

33:06.688 --> 33:07.387
Naser!

33:07.421 --> 33:08.756
See, he's violent.

33:08.790 --> 33:09.891
Did you
get rough like that

33:09.924 --> 33:11.659
with my aunt too?

33:11.693 --> 33:12.794
I didn't do anything.

33:12.827 --> 33:14.962
Tell that to my dead aunt.

33:14.996 --> 33:16.798
Miss Alex took her own life.

33:16.831 --> 33:18.966
Oh and how convenient that
she added you to the will

33:19.000 --> 33:20.902
just before she kicked it.

33:20.935 --> 33:24.304
Miss Alex took me in
when I had nowhere to go.

33:25.472 --> 33:26.874
She was kind when
nobody else was.

33:27.775 --> 33:30.011
She prepared me to
take care of this house

33:30.044 --> 33:33.380
and she told me about the
curse and about the guardians.

33:33.413 --> 33:34.882
Do you hear yourself?

33:34.916 --> 33:38.552
The shadows that you
see, I see them too.

33:38.586 --> 33:40.387
Ever since miss Alex has gone,

33:40.420 --> 33:42.824
there's been something
out there in this forest.

33:49.296 --> 33:50.665
It's them.

33:50.698 --> 33:51.531
They're coming.

33:52.734 --> 33:53.701
It's all in here.

33:54.936 --> 33:56.671
Miss Alex told me all about it.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.242
It's the guardians.

34:03.276 --> 34:06.581
The dead are rising and
they are coming after us.

34:07.682 --> 34:08.583
He's gone mad.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.354
Give me your keys.

34:14.922 --> 34:16.657
What?

34:17.324 --> 34:18.993
We don't know what
he's capable of.

34:19.026 --> 34:20.895
Jane, this isn't right.

34:21.929 --> 34:22.964
Give him your keys.

34:43.751 --> 34:44.819
On you go.

35:04.571 --> 35:07.541
When the undead come
for you, you should run.

35:34.669 --> 35:36.003
Did you see the
look in his eyes?

35:37.038 --> 35:37.772
This isn't right.

35:39.106 --> 35:42.043
You believe his story
of how Alex prepared him

35:42.076 --> 35:44.679
to protect the house
of undead guardians?

35:44.712 --> 35:47.447
It's a horror story
for children, Janny.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.382
At least I'm not locking
people up on a hunch.

35:49.416 --> 35:50.585
Undead, whatevers or not,

35:50.618 --> 35:53.120
I wouldn't mind getting out
of here as soon as possible.

35:53.154 --> 35:54.822
Why, are you scared?

35:55.089 --> 35:57.557
Of course not.

35:57.592 --> 35:58.726
But to be honest,

35:58.759 --> 36:01.596
the only reason we're all
here is the will, isn't it?

36:01.629 --> 36:03.130
The sooner we know what it says,

36:03.164 --> 36:06.399
the sooner we can all
move on with our lives.

36:06.433 --> 36:07.969
What do you suggest then?

36:08.002 --> 36:09.670
Let's find out
what's in the will

36:09.704 --> 36:11.138
and get the hell out of here.

36:11.172 --> 36:12.840
Naser should be there too.

36:12.874 --> 36:14.141
Screw that.

36:14.175 --> 36:16.543
I prefer him locked up
in the drawing room.

36:16.577 --> 36:17.945
Shouldn't we at least
go to the police

36:17.979 --> 36:19.981
or get a lawyer before
we deal with the will?

36:20.447 --> 36:22.950
Once the police and
lawyers are involved,

36:22.984 --> 36:24.551
it'll take months.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.835
Hand me your lighter, please.

37:01.689 --> 37:03.124
Do you guys think
there was something going on

37:03.157 --> 37:04.557
between Saul and Aunt Alex?

37:05.126 --> 37:06.794
What difference does it make?

37:26.513 --> 37:28.783
Jane, what is it?

37:41.996 --> 37:43.064
What does it say then?

37:46.934 --> 37:47.835
What was that?

37:50.271 --> 37:52.173
Perhaps it was the
undead guardians.

37:54.308 --> 37:56.677
Maybe we shouldn't answer.

37:56.711 --> 37:59.146
You two really are a
match made in heaven.

38:33.014 --> 38:34.015
Who is it?

39:26.167 --> 39:30.004
Come on, let's
go, let's go, come on!

39:41.849 --> 39:43.951
What was that?

39:46.720 --> 39:50.357
A guardian, an undead.

39:50.391 --> 39:51.592
That's impossible.

39:53.394 --> 39:55.196
Don't worry,

39:55.229 --> 39:56.363
I don't think they
can unlock doors.

40:08.742 --> 40:10.377
How did you get out?

40:10.945 --> 40:13.214
Spare set of keys.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.382
Let's check on the others.

40:43.344 --> 40:45.679
Miss Jennifer?

40:45.713 --> 40:46.347
Mr. Nigel?

40:48.482 --> 40:49.683
Naser?

40:52.987 --> 40:53.787
Jane.

40:57.725 --> 40:58.726
What happened?

40:58.759 --> 40:59.360
Who was that maniac?

41:00.461 --> 41:01.896
Saul.

41:01.929 --> 41:02.429
She's alive?

41:04.398 --> 41:05.432
I don't know.

41:05.466 --> 41:08.669
She's dead, but... not.

41:09.470 --> 41:10.771
But we locked
her in the car.

41:10.804 --> 41:12.106
I saw her die, Naser.

41:12.139 --> 41:14.408
Oh she died, but
then she rose again.

41:15.843 --> 41:17.378
And now she hunts the living.

41:17.411 --> 41:18.979
She tried to rip my throat out,

41:19.013 --> 41:20.748
I can tell you that much.

41:20.781 --> 41:22.816
And her touch was freezing.

41:22.850 --> 41:24.451
There was something
uncanny about her.

41:26.086 --> 41:30.724
If it hadn't have been for
him, she would've killed me.

41:30.991 --> 41:32.159
So he killed her?

41:32.193 --> 41:34.929
You cannot kill what
is already dead.

41:34.962 --> 41:36.997
She is one of the guardians now.

41:38.098 --> 41:40.401
The undead have risen

41:40.434 --> 41:42.203
and they are coming after us.

41:44.538 --> 41:45.706
It's all in here.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.745
All I want is to
get out of here.

41:51.779 --> 41:53.314
The only working car is locked

41:53.347 --> 41:54.748
and we can't find Saul's keys.

41:54.782 --> 41:55.916
That's her jacket.

41:57.318 --> 41:58.485
What are you doing?

42:00.421 --> 42:01.222
Got ya.

42:05.492 --> 42:07.161
Good thinking, 99.

42:26.814 --> 42:28.148
Be careful.

42:28.182 --> 42:30.384
There might be more of
the undead out there.

42:34.989 --> 42:37.091
See, there's nothing out here.

42:50.605 --> 42:52.473
Come on, give them to him.

42:55.677 --> 42:57.211
It's one of those bio thingies.

42:57.244 --> 42:58.212
What?

42:58.245 --> 42:59.013
Let me see.

43:01.482 --> 43:02.549
Oh fuck.

43:02.584 --> 43:03.884
Can we please keep quiet?

43:03.917 --> 43:05.185
I don't want the
guardians to hear us.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.454
We need Saul's fingerprint
to activate the car.

43:07.488 --> 43:08.856
Why the long faces?

43:08.889 --> 43:10.024
We only need Saul's finger.

43:10.057 --> 43:11.825
Mr. Nigel, please whisper.

43:11.859 --> 43:12.761
Oh just-

43:12.793 --> 43:14.928
Please babe, we should
leave Saul alone,

43:14.962 --> 43:16.330
she's too dangerous.

43:16.363 --> 43:18.165
What do you suggest
we do darling?

43:19.900 --> 43:21.302
What about granddad's motorbike?

43:21.335 --> 43:23.504
We can't fit four grown
people on a motorbike.

43:23.537 --> 43:24.438
We can try.

43:24.471 --> 43:25.939
How do you even know
it's still working?

43:25.973 --> 43:26.874
She's got a point, darling.

43:26.907 --> 43:28.342
Anyway, Alex might've sold it.

43:28.842 --> 43:29.443
It wouldn't hurt to look.

43:29.476 --> 43:31.613
I know the bike you mean.

43:31.646 --> 43:34.548
I moved it over
there to the garage.

43:34.582 --> 43:36.283
There isn't a garage.

43:36.317 --> 43:38.552
Miss Alex asked me to
set it up over there.

43:40.954 --> 43:42.556
A garage?

43:42.590 --> 43:43.857
It's called a garden.

43:45.292 --> 43:46.126
Follow me.

43:58.372 --> 43:59.907
What's all this?

44:00.941 --> 44:02.943
They're waiting to be shipped.

44:02.976 --> 44:03.977
Shipped where?

44:04.011 --> 44:04.612
Home.

44:04.646 --> 44:05.879
To Syria?

44:06.614 --> 44:07.848
Yes.

44:09.016 --> 44:12.886
Miss Alex said I could take
anything I want from the house

44:12.920 --> 44:13.987
to help rebuild my country.

44:18.225 --> 44:19.560
What is it?

44:19.594 --> 44:20.961
I saw something by
the edge of the woods.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.529
I'm not sure what it was.

44:22.563 --> 44:24.565
We have to hurry, the
guardians are coming.

44:28.502 --> 44:30.537
I've nearly finished fixing it.

44:30.571 --> 44:32.172
It will need petrol though.

44:32.206 --> 44:34.642
I can take a jerry can and
get petrol from Saul's car.

44:34.676 --> 44:36.377
You'll need two
lengths of tubing

44:36.410 --> 44:38.245
and something to seal the
mouth of the petrol tank.

44:39.647 --> 44:41.482
What? I did a piece on
greening for my channel.

44:47.622 --> 44:48.455
Here.

44:50.190 --> 44:51.992
You'll need to be quiet.

44:52.025 --> 44:52.960
Don't make a sound.

44:52.993 --> 44:54.294
Don't use your light either.

44:54.328 --> 44:55.462
They're drawn by the light.

44:57.699 --> 44:59.967
You shouldn't go by yourself.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.301
Please take Nigel with you.

45:03.203 --> 45:04.037
What?

45:15.650 --> 45:17.084
You didn't have to come with me.

45:17.117 --> 45:18.352
It's not for your sake.

45:20.120 --> 45:22.322
Do you always do
everything she says?

45:23.023 --> 45:24.958
We're not that kind of couple.

45:24.992 --> 45:26.460
What does that even mean?

45:27.161 --> 45:27.695
You know what?

45:27.729 --> 45:28.929
I don't want to know.

45:31.398 --> 45:32.734
Fuck it's diesel.

45:32.767 --> 45:33.967
So?

45:34.968 --> 45:37.639
You can't put diesel in
a motor bike, it breaks.

45:37.672 --> 45:39.273
I'll get petrol from my car.

45:40.675 --> 45:43.110
Have you ever removed
petrol from a car before?

45:43.143 --> 45:45.747
You've seen my car,
what do you think?

45:45.780 --> 45:47.281
That you need a new car.

45:47.314 --> 45:49.983
Yeah, I need new car, new
clothes and a new life.

45:50.017 --> 45:51.719
And from my share
I can get all that.

45:51.753 --> 45:53.153
That's why you're here?

45:53.187 --> 45:55.289
Well, I know that's why
you and Jennifer are.

46:01.562 --> 46:02.597
Where does this go?

46:03.798 --> 46:05.499
Let me show you.

46:13.708 --> 46:15.342
Come under the
tarpaulin with me.

46:17.110 --> 46:19.179
I need you to hold
my lamp so I can see.

46:43.070 --> 46:44.505
Were you in the army?

46:44.538 --> 46:45.640
Why do you ask that?

46:47.541 --> 46:49.476
How do you know so
much about engines?

46:51.579 --> 46:52.479
I was a nurse.

46:53.681 --> 46:54.782
But before the war,

46:54.816 --> 46:57.785
I often watched my friend
Dapter, he was a mechanic.

46:57.819 --> 46:59.386
He had very skilled hands.

47:01.589 --> 47:03.056
Good, strong hands.

47:06.426 --> 47:07.461
And he was smart,

47:08.863 --> 47:11.031
one of the smartest
people I've ever known.

47:15.637 --> 47:17.070
Was he a close friend?

47:21.643 --> 47:22.577
Where is he now?

47:25.145 --> 47:26.346
I don't know, home.

47:26.380 --> 47:28.282
I left when the war
came, he stayed.

47:30.785 --> 47:32.787
Please, can you
look in the back?

47:32.820 --> 47:34.756
There should be more
of these in a box.

47:34.789 --> 47:36.390
It says engine parts.

47:39.126 --> 47:40.795
Please don't use the torch.

48:10.457 --> 48:12.627
This place
is really creepy.

48:12.660 --> 48:15.529
Yeah, well, there's a
reason for all the stories.

48:15.562 --> 48:17.297
What stories?

48:17.331 --> 48:19.634
There's a legend about
an old pagan curse

48:19.667 --> 48:20.802
and spell or something.

48:21.769 --> 48:23.638
It says that anyone
who lives on this land

48:23.671 --> 48:25.138
becomes its servant

48:25.172 --> 48:27.642
and anyone who dies here
becomes its guardian.

48:27.675 --> 48:29.644
And when the land
is under siege,

48:29.677 --> 48:31.813
you're doomed to rise
and fight the threat.

48:35.950 --> 48:38.620
You certainly know how
to tell a good story,

48:38.653 --> 48:39.754
the undead rising.

48:41.188 --> 48:44.224
I just wonder what upset them.

49:16.223 --> 49:18.860
Naser, why was Alex getting
rid of all her stuff?

49:19.727 --> 49:20.928
Miss Alex was worried.

49:21.863 --> 49:23.698
She thought she was
going to lose the house.

49:23.731 --> 49:26.400
That's why she was trying to
sell everything she could.

49:26.433 --> 49:28.402
Why would she lose the house?

49:28.435 --> 49:30.203
There were letters.

49:30.237 --> 49:31.505
Miss Alex was in trouble.

49:47.655 --> 49:49.624
I'm just gonna go sit down.

49:49.657 --> 49:51.525
- I feel a bit light headed.
- Of course.

50:03.270 --> 50:04.337
Oh my God.

50:04.371 --> 50:06.808
Nigel, what have you done?

50:17.317 --> 50:19.386
[Nigel Let's get the petrol and
get back to the house.

50:31.766 --> 50:32.700
Nigel, what are you doing?

50:32.734 --> 50:34.001
Switch off the light.

50:38.039 --> 50:39.539
Nigel, the light.

50:39.573 --> 50:40.708
Did you hear that?

50:58.325 --> 51:00.027
They're close.

51:00.061 --> 51:00.995
I'm almost done.

51:07.501 --> 51:08.335
Nigel!

51:09.469 --> 51:10.872
Bloody coward.

51:33.094 --> 51:34.494
What is it, Naser?

51:34.528 --> 51:36.429
We're missing parts.

51:36.463 --> 51:37.899
The bike, I can't fix it.

51:41.068 --> 51:42.069
I read the letter.

51:46.941 --> 51:47.742
Nigel!

51:49.509 --> 51:51.779
They're out there, in the woods,

51:51.813 --> 51:52.613
they attacked us.

51:55.082 --> 51:56.717
They came out of nowhere.

51:56.751 --> 51:58.686
Nigel, baby, slow
down. Where is Jane?

51:59.620 --> 52:00.588
There was nothing I could do.

52:03.624 --> 52:05.425
You left her behind?

52:05.458 --> 52:06.994
They're everywhere.

52:07.028 --> 52:08.129
Jane didn't want to
leave without the petrol.

52:08.162 --> 52:10.064
I did everything I could.

52:12.166 --> 52:13.000
They're coming.

52:14.101 --> 52:15.002
We have to go help her.

52:15.937 --> 52:17.772
That's suicide, Janny.

52:17.805 --> 52:19.040
Nigel, you left her behind.

52:21.709 --> 52:23.010
We have to go, over the wall.

52:24.946 --> 52:27.414
Here, take this.

52:28.282 --> 52:29.684
These will get you
through the back door.

52:32.820 --> 52:33.486
Are you...?

52:33.520 --> 52:34.856
I'll cover you.

52:34.889 --> 52:36.489
Go!

54:05.880 --> 54:06.814
Run, run!

54:09.951 --> 54:11.052
They're coming!

54:12.552 --> 54:13.154
Go, go!

54:35.009 --> 54:37.510
No, no, no!

54:42.283 --> 54:45.518
Some sacrifices have to be
made for the greater good.

54:46.153 --> 54:48.889
No, no, no!

54:48.923 --> 54:50.992
Ahhh! <i>Allah!</i>

54:53.327 --> 54:54.161
Mr. Nigel!

54:55.329 --> 54:56.529
Mr. Nigel!

54:58.032 --> 54:59.100
No!

54:59.367 --> 55:00.201
No!

55:42.676 --> 55:44.211
The shotgun!

55:59.693 --> 56:03.230
Jennifer, Nigel, is that you?

56:09.036 --> 56:10.104
Jane!

56:10.538 --> 56:11.705
I thought they got you.

56:11.739 --> 56:13.007
It was close enough.

56:13.040 --> 56:13.841
Where's Naser?

56:13.874 --> 56:15.342
Close the damn door.

56:15.376 --> 56:16.811
Jennifer, what happened?

56:16.844 --> 56:18.746
He didn't make it.

56:18.779 --> 56:20.881
Fuck, give me the keys.

56:24.718 --> 56:27.288
The petrol, it's in
the great hall.

56:30.057 --> 56:31.826
Jane, Naser couldn't
fix the bike.

56:31.859 --> 56:33.360
So I risked my life for nothing?

56:34.762 --> 56:37.298
Naser lost his life for nothing.

56:37.331 --> 56:39.300
Not much we could've
done, they got him.

56:40.668 --> 56:41.902
The same way they
got me, you mean?

56:43.437 --> 56:44.638
I did what I had to.

56:44.672 --> 56:46.307
And what was that exactly?

56:46.340 --> 56:47.842
I ran to get the help.

56:47.875 --> 56:49.243
You left me to die.

56:49.276 --> 56:51.112
I warned the others, didn't I?

56:52.046 --> 56:52.880
Yes.

56:57.384 --> 57:00.387
Shh, come on, it's all
right darling.

57:00.421 --> 57:02.223
Not for Naser it isn't.

57:02.256 --> 57:03.791
You're such a hypocrite.

57:03.824 --> 57:05.092
You didn't give
a damn about him.

57:05.126 --> 57:07.194
I didn't leave anyone
to die though, did I?

57:07.228 --> 57:09.797
We have to look after
ourselves first.

57:09.830 --> 57:10.664
Janny, tell her.

57:20.875 --> 57:24.011
Have it your way but
don't kid yourselves,

57:24.044 --> 57:26.847
those undead, whatever
they are, they're out there

57:26.881 --> 57:29.183
and if you want to survive,
you'll do what it takes.

57:34.488 --> 57:37.124
Your sister is
ruining everything.

57:37.158 --> 57:39.994
Jennifer, you do realize
she's fucking everything up?

57:40.027 --> 57:41.128
I realize you are.

57:43.264 --> 57:44.365
Where did you get that?

57:44.398 --> 57:45.799
You knew it was a
rotten investment

57:45.833 --> 57:47.201
that Alex made from the start.

57:48.002 --> 57:49.136
It was high risk.
Your aunt knew that.

57:49.170 --> 57:51.872
But she only did it
because <i>you</i> told her to.

57:52.506 --> 57:55.876
Even if she lost
out, you would win,

57:55.910 --> 57:57.711
the bank would win.

57:58.279 --> 58:00.915
The banks always win, Jennifer.

58:13.761 --> 58:15.229
But why, Nigel?

58:15.262 --> 58:17.498
You knew she would do
everything to repay her debts

58:17.531 --> 58:18.832
and keep the estate.

58:22.002 --> 58:23.437
And you would get paid double?

58:23.470 --> 58:27.074
It's just good business,
Janny, doubling the profits.

58:27.107 --> 58:29.410
And who in their right
mind would pass on that?

58:29.443 --> 58:32.112
Don't get me wrong, you
can profit from this too.

58:32.146 --> 58:33.514
Hell even Jane
could have profited

58:33.547 --> 58:36.517
if she had the sense
to play her part.

58:36.550 --> 58:40.221
You've seen her moods,
how difficult she is.

58:40.254 --> 58:43.324
It's not worth us trying to
come to an agreement with her.

58:43.357 --> 58:44.959
We don't need her.

58:52.866 --> 58:54.101
I'm sorry that came out wrong...

58:54.134 --> 58:55.970
I get it, Nigel.

59:03.844 --> 59:04.478
Nigel!

59:07.181 --> 59:08.515
Get out of the way!

59:08.549 --> 59:10.317
Nigel, the keys!

59:42.316 --> 59:44.084
Would you
stop pacing please?

59:44.818 --> 59:47.087
I don't understand how
you can just sit there.

59:47.121 --> 59:48.322
They've got us trapped.

59:48.355 --> 59:49.591
You're pacing won't help.

59:49.624 --> 59:51.492
Neither does your nagging.

59:51.525 --> 59:53.494
Whatever issues you two
have got going on right now,

59:53.527 --> 59:55.362
this is not the
time or the place.

59:55.396 --> 59:56.830
What's your plan anyway?

59:56.864 --> 59:58.499
Wait till they lose interest?

1:00:14.148 --> 1:00:16.317
You're angry with me
right now, I get it.

1:00:16.350 --> 1:00:17.551
You may not want to hear this

1:00:17.585 --> 1:00:20.421
but your sister won't
get us out of here.

1:00:20.454 --> 1:00:22.856
We have to take matters
into our own hands

1:00:22.890 --> 1:00:24.291
if we want to survive.

1:00:24.325 --> 1:00:26.327
I'm so done with your bullshit.

1:00:27.194 --> 1:00:28.962
My bullshit?

1:00:28.996 --> 1:00:30.364
You always knew exactly
what was going on

1:00:30.397 --> 1:00:32.032
and you never objected.

1:00:32.066 --> 1:00:33.200
This is me objecting.

1:00:34.401 --> 1:00:35.269
Jennifer.

1:00:36.403 --> 1:00:38.172
Jane, I have to
tell you something.

1:00:43.310 --> 1:00:44.579
What's this?

1:00:44.612 --> 1:00:45.913
It's nothing,
Janny's just upset.

1:00:45.946 --> 1:00:47.181
Jane, Alex was in
debt up to her ears

1:00:47.214 --> 1:00:48.616
and Nigel and I knew.

1:00:48.650 --> 1:00:50.551
For months she was selling
all of her belongings

1:00:50.585 --> 1:00:53.120
just to pay back the
bank, Nigel's bank.

1:01:02.630 --> 1:01:04.264
What did you do?

1:01:04.965 --> 1:01:05.633
It wasn't me.

1:01:05.667 --> 1:01:07.501
It was the bank.

1:01:07.534 --> 1:01:09.470
And you didn't help her?

1:01:09.503 --> 1:01:10.605
Neither did your sister.

1:01:11.606 --> 1:01:13.374
Is that true?

1:01:13.407 --> 1:01:14.208
It is.

1:01:14.241 --> 1:01:15.577
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

1:01:15.610 --> 1:01:17.511
Yeah well, he should
have known better.

1:01:17.544 --> 1:01:19.113
So should I.

1:01:19.146 --> 1:01:20.615
All I saw was the money.

1:01:20.648 --> 1:01:22.383
You did too, we all did.

1:01:22.416 --> 1:01:24.017
Naser was the only
one that didn't,

1:01:24.051 --> 1:01:24.918
he just wanted a home.

1:01:24.952 --> 1:01:26.520
Yeah and now he's dead.

1:01:27.722 --> 1:01:30.592
We can't afford to
lose anyone else.

1:01:34.094 --> 1:01:37.564
Jane, listen to me, he's
just a cog in the machine.

1:02:01.021 --> 1:02:02.189
Peace?

1:02:12.266 --> 1:02:13.467
Duly noted.

1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:16.437
May I ask how you two geniuses
plan to get us out of here?

1:02:16.638 --> 1:02:18.939
Our only vehicle is locked
and the phones are useless.

1:02:19.707 --> 1:02:20.642
I've got an idea,

1:02:22.109 --> 1:02:23.645
it's just not gonna be pretty.

1:02:29.751 --> 1:02:30.652
Are you sure this
is the only way

1:02:30.685 --> 1:02:32.085
to get Saul's fingerprints?

1:02:32.119 --> 1:02:34.021
Well, we can't just
cut off a finger.

1:02:34.054 --> 1:02:35.723
The scanner can detect
if there's no pulse.

1:02:36.691 --> 1:02:39.293
How do you know if she
still even has a pulse?

1:02:40.294 --> 1:02:41.395
I don't know,

1:02:41.428 --> 1:02:43.230
it's just worth a try.

1:02:43.263 --> 1:02:45.767
Remember no skin contact.

1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:47.702
That's how they suck
the life out you.

1:02:49.169 --> 1:02:51.271
Now we just need to
get her attention.

1:03:14.161 --> 1:03:15.763
Come on, Janny, you
can do it, she's dead.

1:03:20.835 --> 1:03:23.170
Janny, take her, take her.

1:03:29.611 --> 1:03:31.044
Come on.

1:03:31.078 --> 1:03:32.814
I'll do it, take over here.

1:05:02.202 --> 1:05:02.770
Nigel.

1:05:06.573 --> 1:05:08.108
He's leaving us behind.

1:05:14.949 --> 1:05:16.550
Nigel, open the door!

1:05:23.891 --> 1:05:25.325
We've got to go.

1:05:45.479 --> 1:05:48.181
Shut up!

1:05:48.215 --> 1:05:48.816
Come on.

1:05:49.984 --> 1:05:52.720
Hold still, you
rotting piece of shit.

1:05:57.959 --> 1:05:58.860
Come on.

1:06:02.997 --> 1:06:03.798
Yes!

1:06:34.896 --> 1:06:35.897
That was Aunt Alex.

1:06:39.266 --> 1:06:40.400
Not anymore.

1:06:42.269 --> 1:06:43.570
She's gone, Janny.

1:07:00.621 --> 1:07:01.889
How do you feel?

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:04.424
Dizziness, sickness?

1:07:06.794 --> 1:07:07.795
Just cold.

1:07:14.769 --> 1:07:16.604
Bastard!

1:07:16.637 --> 1:07:18.271
What is it?
Is someone coming?

1:07:18.305 --> 1:07:21.609
Nigel, he's taken Saul's car.

1:07:35.590 --> 1:07:36.958
I need to disinfect the wound.

1:07:41.996 --> 1:07:44.031
You're as cold as ice.

1:07:45.332 --> 1:07:46.033
What does that
fairy tale book say

1:07:46.067 --> 1:07:47.802
about turning into one of them?

1:07:57.578 --> 1:07:58.613
What are
you looking for?

1:07:59.046 --> 1:08:00.347
Mom's secret stash.

1:08:02.516 --> 1:08:04.417
You think now's the
time to get drunk?

1:08:06.854 --> 1:08:07.688
Bingo.

1:08:18.398 --> 1:08:19.033
Don't move.

1:08:55.069 --> 1:08:57.004
How many shells
have you got left?

1:08:58.172 --> 1:08:59.006
Two.

1:09:01.676 --> 1:09:02.509
Fitting.

1:09:14.055 --> 1:09:16.657
Knowledge is
power all right.

1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:47.088
Ugh.

1:09:52.525 --> 1:09:54.061
How did we end up here, Jane?

1:09:56.030 --> 1:09:58.032
We were normal sisters
once, weren't we?

1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:02.435
There was never anything
normal about us.

1:10:04.571 --> 1:10:07.507
Do you remember when we
visited grand and grandad

1:10:07.540 --> 1:10:08.576
and we ran away?

1:10:10.011 --> 1:10:12.780
Yeah, we ended up in the
walled garden, didn't we?

1:10:12.813 --> 1:10:14.815
I don't even know
why we did that.

1:10:14.849 --> 1:10:17.450
I think you really loved
Huckleberry Finn at the time

1:10:17.484 --> 1:10:19.587
and you thought it was
something the cool kids did.

1:10:21.055 --> 1:10:22.690
I remember now.

1:10:22.723 --> 1:10:24.557
And wasn't mum talking
to gran and granddad

1:10:24.592 --> 1:10:26.994
and we were shuffling about
and packing our backpacks?

1:10:28.195 --> 1:10:30.197
Then we wandered
off, had a picnic

1:10:30.231 --> 1:10:31.165
and we were back by four.

1:10:31.198 --> 1:10:32.600
Mom was so upset.

1:10:33.768 --> 1:10:35.236
They made such a fuss.

1:10:35.269 --> 1:10:37.905
A few minutes later, they
would've called the police.

1:10:46.714 --> 1:10:49.116
That was the last time we
were all in this house.

1:10:49.784 --> 1:10:51.986
A month later, granddad died.

1:10:52.452 --> 1:10:54.922
And then gran and then...

1:10:56.290 --> 1:10:57.490
Mom.

1:11:04.065 --> 1:11:05.565
I remember her singing to me

1:11:05.599 --> 1:11:06.968
when she'd put me to sleep.

1:11:37.832 --> 1:11:40.234
♪ She wept, she toiled ♪

1:11:40.267 --> 1:11:42.937
♪ Her youth had been spoiled ♪

1:11:42.970 --> 1:11:44.071
I miss her.

1:11:46.573 --> 1:11:48.109
♪ She'd had it all planned ♪

1:11:48.142 --> 1:11:51.912
♪ Oh she'd done all the work ♪

1:11:51.946 --> 1:11:55.216
I can't believe you kept this
old Walkman all these years.

1:11:55.249 --> 1:11:56.050
Me neither.

1:11:57.051 --> 1:12:00.021
Mom's songs helped me get
through some pretty rough times.

1:12:01.922 --> 1:12:04.692
I'm sorry for the way
things happened, Jane.

1:12:04.725 --> 1:12:06.594
It was dad's decision
to leave you behind.

1:12:07.762 --> 1:12:09.529
'Cause I'm not his
flesh and blood?

1:12:11.065 --> 1:12:12.565
But you've always been mine.

1:12:13.267 --> 1:12:14.567
You could have said something.

1:12:14.602 --> 1:12:16.137
I was a kid, Jane.

1:12:16.170 --> 1:12:18.571
All I wanted was a sister
and mother and a home.

1:12:23.277 --> 1:12:25.846
And all I gave you was anger.

1:12:34.121 --> 1:12:37.792
Here's to family, however
screwed up they might be.

1:12:48.169 --> 1:12:49.303
Ahh.

1:12:51.906 --> 1:12:54.875
I've just had an idea
how we can get out of here.

1:12:54.909 --> 1:12:56.043
Don't Janny.

1:12:56.077 --> 1:12:58.212
No listen, the tandem.

1:12:59.413 --> 1:13:00.281
What?

1:13:00.314 --> 1:13:01.816
Our tandem, it's in
the walled garden,

1:13:01.849 --> 1:13:03.084
I've seen it,

1:13:03.117 --> 1:13:04.852
we can ride it out of here.

1:13:04.885 --> 1:13:06.987
You want out-cycle a hoard

1:13:07.021 --> 1:13:09.990
of blood-freezing undead

1:13:10.024 --> 1:13:10.758
on a tandem?

1:14:05.179 --> 1:14:08.682
Jennifer, it's all right,
it's not your fault.

1:14:09.783 --> 1:14:11.218
We have to hurry.

1:14:12.186 --> 1:14:13.387
No more fighting.

1:14:15.422 --> 1:14:17.992
Live or die together, sister.

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:20.961
I love you.

1:14:20.995 --> 1:14:22.096
I love you too.

1:14:22.129 --> 1:14:22.963
Ready?

1:14:23.864 --> 1:14:24.698
Ready.

1:14:40.414 --> 1:14:42.716
They're catching
up, go faster.

1:14:42.750 --> 1:14:44.218
I'm trying.

1:14:44.251 --> 1:14:46.253
You've got to
pedal in sync with me.

1:14:46.287 --> 1:14:47.888
Put on your Walkman.

1:14:47.922 --> 1:14:50.191
I need a rhythm to cycle to.

1:15:01.769 --> 1:15:03.771
It's working!

1:16:01.495 --> 1:16:02.896
Do you see him anywhere?

1:16:34.361 --> 1:16:35.929
Has he turned into one of them?

1:17:05.326 --> 1:17:08.862
<i>To my nieces, Jane
and Jennifer Dormant,</i>

1:17:09.897 --> 1:17:12.232
<i>it is time for you to put
aside your differences.</i>

1:17:13.934 --> 1:17:15.202
<i>After my passing,</i>

1:17:15.235 --> 1:17:17.838
<i>you will be the sole
heirs to Hobbes House.</i>

1:17:18.572 --> 1:17:19.607
<i>Whatever you do,</i>

1:17:19.641 --> 1:17:22.943
<i>you must never sell the
property or the land.</i>

1:17:23.911 --> 1:17:27.081
<i>The old stories about
the guardians are real.</i>

1:17:27.114 --> 1:17:28.515
<i>They will come for you</i>

1:17:28.549 --> 1:17:32.453
<i>and anyone who tries to
cause harm to the land.</i>

1:17:32.486 --> 1:17:35.923
<i>Our family's legacy
now falls on you,</i>

1:17:35.956 --> 1:17:38.158
<i>the protectors of Hobbes House.</i>

1:17:41.596 --> 1:17:44.565
<i>Only unity will keep you safe.</i>

1:17:55.409 --> 1:17:57.177
Aunt Alex left us Hobbes House.

1:18:00.314 --> 1:18:01.348
That means we're in debt.

1:18:02.383 --> 1:18:03.250
Looks like it.

1:18:04.985 --> 1:18:06.588
Jane, the banks,

1:18:06.621 --> 1:18:09.089
they won't let us off
the hook that easily.

1:18:09.123 --> 1:18:11.659
They'll do everything they
can to keep the property.

1:18:13.093 --> 1:18:13.927
We can't let that happen.

1:18:16.296 --> 1:18:17.931
We have to stick
