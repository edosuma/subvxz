WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:02.534
Kids, there's nothing
more wonderful

00:02.544 --> 00:04.318
than New York City
in the winter...

00:04.353 --> 00:06.507
except the view of New
York City in the winter

00:06.517 --> 00:08.379
through your apartment window.

00:08.421 --> 00:11.307
In the winter of 2006,
Marshall, Lily, Robin and I

00:11.317 --> 00:13.901
were all deep in couple
hibernation mode.

00:13.911 --> 00:16.604
Sadly, this left Uncle
Barney out in the cold.

00:16.614 --> 00:18.792
Okay. All-night rave,

00:18.802 --> 00:20.655
abandoned tire
factory in Newark.

00:20.668 --> 00:22.420
We're on the list. Who's in?

00:22.433 --> 00:24.141
- Nope.
- No.

00:26.137 --> 00:30.103
Private jet. Teeterboro Airport,
skinny-skydiving. Who's in?

00:30.119 --> 00:31.572
- Nope.
- No, thanks.

00:33.429 --> 00:38.422
One beer. Bar, downstairs,
15 second walk. Who's in?

00:38.436 --> 00:41.913
Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.

00:43.896 --> 00:46.892
It got so bad,
Barney tried to be his own wingman.

00:46.905 --> 00:49.283
Hi. Have you met me?

00:51.268 --> 00:53.930
Finally, he decided to
bring in reinforcements.

00:53.948 --> 00:55.373
- No.
- No.

00:55.398 --> 00:58.133
Yes. And do you know why?

00:58.145 --> 01:01.701
Hang on to your bedsores,
grandparents from Willy Wonka,

01:01.715 --> 01:04.931
because guess who's on his way
up to this apartment right now?

01:04.947 --> 01:07.761
My... wait for it...

01:07.775 --> 01:10.382
brother, James. React.

01:10.397 --> 01:11.562
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:11.578 --> 01:13.053
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

01:13.068 --> 01:17.273
He's the "awesome-est," most best
"looking-est," greatest guy ever.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.220
He's exactly like Barney.

01:19.235 --> 01:20.763
That's what I just said.

01:21.258 --> 01:24.151
Well, Barney and his brother
aren't exactly alike.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.650
James is gay.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.582
Really? I never in
a million years

01:27.596 --> 01:30.233
would I picture you with a gay brother,
that's awesome.

01:30.247 --> 01:31.973
Yeah. I just wanted
you to have a heads up,

01:31.987 --> 01:34.433
so you don't act all
surprised when he gets here.

01:34.757 --> 01:36.132
Here he is.

01:38.286 --> 01:40.072
What up, New York.

01:42.707 --> 01:44.190
Thanks for the heads up.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

01:58.237 --> 02:02.602
How in God's name did it never come up
that Barney has a gay, black brother?

02:02.738 --> 02:04.201
Is he black?

02:04.227 --> 02:07.011
I guess I'm the kind of person that
focuses on who people are on the inside

02:07.047 --> 02:09.370
rather than the
color of their skin.

02:09.384 --> 02:12.360
I'm kidding,
I just wanted to see your face.

02:12.787 --> 02:14.662
Yeah, so now the
wedding's back on.

02:14.678 --> 02:16.400
Anyway, James,
how have you been?

02:16.415 --> 02:17.913
Awesome, as per "yoozh."

02:17.928 --> 02:20.891
I just went
skinny-skydiving. Legendary.

02:20.905 --> 02:23.702
And my laser tag team,
just made it to regional finals.

02:23.715 --> 02:25.460
"Legendarier."

02:25.478 --> 02:27.462
And by now you've
noticed the suit--

02:27.477 --> 02:28.520
go 'head, touch it.

02:28.538 --> 02:31.202
Handcrafted by
Pietro Dellacamera,

02:31.216 --> 02:35.022
Milan's famous
101-year-old tailor

02:35.038 --> 02:37.323
who upon completing
the very last stitch

02:37.338 --> 02:39.343
in this suit dropped dead,

02:39.358 --> 02:42.371
which is ironic because that
is how gorgeous I look in it.

02:42.387 --> 02:43.612
C'mon.

02:48.507 --> 02:49.732
Gimme five.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.350
Is "gimme five" back?

02:51.367 --> 02:53.750
Oh, yeah.
I put it in my blog this morning.

02:53.856 --> 02:56.300
Guys, "gimme five" is back!

02:56.565 --> 02:58.421
Oh, James,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

02:58.437 --> 03:00.833
- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.632
So, I have to ask,
there's a story here.

03:04.098 --> 03:05.423
Please.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.460
The truth is,
Barney and James got a lot of...

03:08.476 --> 03:10.861
different explanations from
their mom over the years.

03:10.876 --> 03:13.030
Well, boys, you look different

03:13.048 --> 03:15.070
because when I was
pregnant with you,

03:15.085 --> 03:17.301
I only ate vanilla ice cream.

03:17.315 --> 03:19.280
And when I was
pregnant with you,

03:19.296 --> 03:21.422
can you guess what kind
of ice cream I ate?

03:21.436 --> 03:23.501
- Coffee?
- No, James,

03:23.516 --> 03:25.831
I ate chocolate ice cream.

03:25.847 --> 03:29.631
But I did drink tons of coffee when
I was pregnant with both of you.

03:29.648 --> 03:31.782
Can't smoke without my coffee.

03:32.428 --> 03:36.580
I don't know, boys,
I guess it's just one of those things.

03:37.395 --> 03:38.971
Stop asking me!

03:38.985 --> 03:41.860
You  know what you two are?
You're little racists!

03:41.986 --> 03:43.813
So what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

03:43.827 --> 03:45.371
I'll tell you what
James is gonna do.

03:45.386 --> 03:47.391
He's gonna do the job
you've been neglecting.

03:47.405 --> 03:51.291
And, as always, he'll do it a
lot better than you ever did.

03:51.328 --> 03:52.580
Ted...

03:52.597 --> 03:55.701
James is my wingman now.

03:56.216 --> 03:57.632
Okay.

03:58.478 --> 04:01.900
Last time James was in town,
Barney got slapped once,

04:01.917 --> 04:03.581
lucky twice, and...

04:03.597 --> 04:05.433
whose penthouse hot
tub did you end up in?

04:05.448 --> 04:07.811
Ah, public figure,
confidentiality agreement.

04:07.826 --> 04:09.132
But I will say this:

04:09.148 --> 04:10.773
way more back hair than any guy

04:10.788 --> 04:13.930
who can afford laser hair
removal should have.

04:13.945 --> 04:18.072
And then there was the time they
scored the brother/sister combo.

04:18.084 --> 04:19.672
It was everything
we ever dreamed of

04:19.685 --> 04:21.503
when watching Donnie and Marie.

04:21.515 --> 04:23.400
She was a little bit country.

04:23.415 --> 04:26.180
He was a little bit
way into black guys.

04:26.205 --> 04:29.651
Yeah, Barney and James together
was a lethal combination.

04:29.668 --> 04:32.063
Since there was never
any crossover in targets,

04:32.077 --> 04:35.180
James was always there for
Barney with the assist.

04:39.518 --> 04:41.703
Whoa. Your scarf...

04:41.715 --> 04:43.622
it is fierce!

04:43.635 --> 04:45.211
Thanks. H & M.

04:45.225 --> 04:46.733
What? I would never know,

04:46.745 --> 04:51.103
'cause it is so hot that my eyes
are melting. Oh, I can't see.

04:51.427 --> 04:53.683
Hey! You know,
speaking of things

04:53.698 --> 04:55.483
that would look good
wrapped around you,

04:55.497 --> 04:57.913
have you met my straight
brother, Barney?

04:57.926 --> 05:02.392
Oh, he is fab--
don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay?

05:02.465 --> 05:04.880
And Barney always
returned the favor.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.443
Help, I don't think
he's breathing.

05:06.456 --> 05:08.173
Does anyone
know mouth-to-mouth?

05:08.188 --> 05:10.173
Oh, my God, I do!

05:10.375 --> 05:13.033
Okay, great.
How 'bout you instead?

05:13.905 --> 05:16.081
Oh, man,
I am so excited that you're here!

05:16.095 --> 05:18.213
It has been forever since
I have been around anyone

05:18.227 --> 05:19.870
even remotely fun.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.823
Uh, yes offense.

05:22.327 --> 05:24.560
You guys are still going
out with us tonight, right?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.170
- No. 
- Jammies.

05:26.185 --> 05:28.541
Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...

05:28.555 --> 05:30.571
I have warm soup belly.

05:30.687 --> 05:33.571
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...

05:33.587 --> 05:36.363
you are young,
attractive people here

05:36.377 --> 05:38.851
in the greatest city on earth.

05:38.866 --> 05:40.321
There  are boys and girls

05:40.336 --> 05:43.092
in Nobody Cares, Wyoming,
wishing they could be here.

05:43.106 --> 05:46.383
But instead, they are in someone's
basement drinking bad malt liquor,

05:46.395 --> 05:49.091
debating whether or not they're
going to spend their Saturday night

05:49.107 --> 05:50.622
in  the parking lot
of the feed store

05:50.636 --> 05:52.922
or in some other
dude's basement.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.623
You owe it to them to rise up

05:55.706 --> 05:57.913
and shimmy your lazy
asses into something hot,

05:57.928 --> 06:01.090
and you go out there and
you live their dream!

06:01.107 --> 06:02.861
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

06:02.997 --> 06:05.441
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

06:05.458 --> 06:07.111
- Can I get a "woo-woo"?
- Woo-woo!

06:07.126 --> 06:10.260
Go do it for Wyoming! Yes!

06:10.345 --> 06:12.042
Testify!

06:12.876 --> 06:15.233
So that night,
Barney got his wish.

06:15.248 --> 06:16.381
We all went out.

06:16.397 --> 06:17.890
Daddy's home!

06:18.283 --> 06:19.501
Yeah.

06:21.937 --> 06:23.863
All right, bro.
What do you like?

06:23.879 --> 06:26.042
Guy in super tight black T?

06:26.059 --> 06:27.731
Super tight black guy?

06:27.748 --> 06:29.322
Guy who looks like Mr. T?

06:29.335 --> 06:32.681
Mmm, yes, yes, and...
talk to me after two martinis.

06:32.697 --> 06:34.742
Let's focus on you, my man.

06:35.088 --> 06:36.833
I'm feeling lazy.

06:36.898 --> 06:38.550
How 'bout girl with
the chocolatini?

06:38.568 --> 06:41.492
Oh... boom, back tattoo.

06:41.628 --> 06:43.210
Hero and the pig?

06:43.227 --> 06:45.132
- Let's ride.
- Fo' 'sho.

06:47.155 --> 06:50.331
Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!

06:50.346 --> 06:52.000
- Get off me, you pig!
- Hey! Hey!

06:52.015 --> 06:54.190
Her body art is not an
invitation to grope her,

06:54.205 --> 06:56.290
it's an expression
of her inner self.

06:56.308 --> 07:00.330
I'm sure, in many ways,
she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.

07:00.347 --> 07:01.861
- What? What?
- What? What?

07:01.877 --> 07:03.600
Cool.

07:05.938 --> 07:07.512
Let me know if he
bothers you again.

07:07.527 --> 07:11.052
Thanks. You should stay close...
just in case.

07:11.065 --> 07:13.952
Sure. If it'll make
you feel safer.

07:14.208 --> 07:15.461
I'm Barney.

07:15.746 --> 07:18.931
Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy,
crowded bar,

07:18.947 --> 07:21.813
you can always tell the
difference between the singles

07:21.826 --> 07:23.392
and the couples.

07:23.405 --> 07:25.773
You just have to
look for the signs.

07:26.376 --> 07:27.580
- Break.
- Boiling hot.

07:27.598 --> 07:29.851
Singles stay on their
feet for maneuverability.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.312
- Hey!
- Hi, how are ya?

07:31.325 --> 07:34.062
Have you met my brother?

07:34.577 --> 07:37.000
Oh, hello. Have a drink.

07:37.016 --> 07:38.691
Nice to meet ya.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.181
Couples, exhausted by the
sheer act of leaving the house,

07:44.197 --> 07:46.601
are obsessed with finding
a place to sit down.

07:47.486 --> 07:49.791
There are a lot of
other indicators, too.

07:49.807 --> 07:51.973
From choice of
social lubricant...

07:53.827 --> 07:55.792
...to basic body language.

07:56.357 --> 07:58.521
But the point is,
there are many ways to tell

07:58.535 --> 08:00.651
whether someone
has Single Stamina

08:00.666 --> 08:02.090
or Couples Coma.

08:02.105 --> 08:03.681
I wish I would've
worn sneakers.

08:03.697 --> 08:06.533
I just got finished running
from some fat, hairy guy

08:06.546 --> 08:09.003
who was periscoping out
of his pleather pants.

08:09.016 --> 08:11.543
Permission to come
aboard denied.

08:11.746 --> 08:13.513
I miss my jammies.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.822
I can't believe I
wore a bra for this.

08:15.837 --> 08:18.823
Bras suck.
They're so confining and unnatural.

08:18.836 --> 08:21.022
Yeah, they're like
a boobie zoo.

08:21.037 --> 08:23.580
Well, why don't you take it off
then and let those puppies breathe?

08:23.617 --> 08:25.720
Oh, please go sweat
on someone else.

08:26.557 --> 08:27.913
Poor guy.

08:28.148 --> 08:30.263
Poor guy? Poor my boobs.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.172
Well, it takes a lot of
guts to approach a girl

08:32.186 --> 08:33.682
and you just crushed him.

08:33.698 --> 08:37.041
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He looks all broken up inside.

08:37.256 --> 08:38.852
Whatever, you guys have
no idea what it's like

08:38.888 --> 08:40.452
to be on the receiving end.

08:40.465 --> 08:43.991
"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl

08:44.006 --> 08:45.970
and everybody everywhere
wants to buy me drinks

08:45.988 --> 08:47.551
and have sex with me."

08:47.566 --> 08:48.441
Waa.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.330
"Oh, poor me.
I get to order yummy, pink drinks

08:51.345 --> 08:53.381
with chunks of real fruit
that guys secretly like,

08:53.395 --> 08:55.150
but  can't order because
they'll be made fun of."

08:55.188 --> 08:56.853
- Dude.
- They're delicious!

08:57.717 --> 09:00.382
Excuse me. Join me in a shot?

09:00.395 --> 09:02.301
Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.

09:05.827 --> 09:07.213
He's too in shape,

09:07.228 --> 09:10.281
we'd spend all night talking
about his body fat content.

09:10.528 --> 09:12.131
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:12.147 --> 09:15.982
I'm gonna go have a yummy,
pink drink with fruit in it...

09:15.996 --> 09:17.572
because I can.

09:19.045 --> 09:21.151
You know, that was,
like, the third hot guy

09:21.168 --> 09:22.862
that James blew off tonight.

09:22.878 --> 09:25.290
Yeah, he's turning down shots,
he's yawning,

09:25.305 --> 09:27.053
he's whining about his feet.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.813
He's as bad as we are.

09:28.827 --> 09:30.002
He is.

09:30.016 --> 09:33.660
Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are.
You guys don't think that James is...

09:33.678 --> 09:35.042
in a relationship?

09:35.058 --> 09:37.742
No. There's no way.
He's Barney's brother.

09:37.755 --> 09:39.322
Look at that.

09:39.968 --> 09:41.802
He's texting!

09:42.976 --> 09:44.510
Oh, my God!

09:44.527 --> 09:46.212
He is in a couple.

09:46.228 --> 09:48.232
This is gonna kill Barney.

09:48.246 --> 09:49.743
What's gonna kill me?

09:49.946 --> 09:51.562
What's going on?

09:51.975 --> 09:53.530
B-Barney?

09:54.305 --> 09:57.802
Have you noticed anything...
different about James?

09:57.817 --> 09:58.872
No.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.042
I mean, he's glowing from his peel,
if that's what you mean.

10:03.667 --> 10:06.333
We have reason to believe
that James is, uh,

10:06.348 --> 10:07.840
maybe hiding
something from you.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.190
I-I know you're not gonna
like hearing this, but...

10:10.207 --> 10:11.640
Barney...

10:11.845 --> 10:13.852
your brother is...

10:14.746 --> 10:16.473
monogamous.

10:17.635 --> 10:19.760
That's ridiculous!

10:19.818 --> 10:22.362
Just because he's
a little sleepy,

10:22.378 --> 10:25.581
and he hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall...

10:27.505 --> 10:30.923
He hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.251
And, Barney...

10:33.266 --> 10:36.081
I hate to be the one to
tell you this, but...

10:37.017 --> 10:38.532
he's texting.

10:38.546 --> 10:40.880
No, he... No!

10:42.575 --> 10:45.362
That... is impossible.

10:48.305 --> 10:51.550
Excuse... Excuse... Ex...

10:52.915 --> 10:53.972
Hey, bro.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.671
Don't change the subject.

10:55.685 --> 10:56.863
Let me see your phone.

10:56.876 --> 10:57.623
Why?

10:57.635 --> 10:59.322
I just want to see your phone.
Let me see your phone.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.510
No, it's just a phone.
It's just a phone!

11:01.527 --> 11:03.742
And it's got Internet access,
and it's got a camera on it,

11:03.777 --> 11:05.502
and you can surf the Web
and do the whole thing.

11:05.535 --> 11:08.063
It's so amazing how far
technology has come.

11:08.075 --> 11:09.142
What kind of phone do you have?

11:09.176 --> 11:10.330
I got...

11:15.256 --> 11:16.461
Who is this? 

11:16.476 --> 11:19.823
And the answer better be:
"I don't remember his name."

11:21.165 --> 11:23.101
That is Tom.

11:24.086 --> 11:25.783
And he's my fiancé.

11:31.797 --> 11:32.862
Hey.

11:34.448 --> 11:36.180
I don't support this.

11:36.235 --> 11:37.331
Gay marriage?

11:37.345 --> 11:40.012
Not gay marriage-- marriage!

11:40.937 --> 11:42.623
How can you do this?

11:42.637 --> 11:45.540
We  were raised in the same house,
with the same values!

11:45.917 --> 11:48.991
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.

11:49.007 --> 11:51.053
Come on, it's embarrassing.

11:51.367 --> 11:54.552
Look, this felt unnatural to me,
too, at first.

11:54.608 --> 11:56.973
But I fell in love.

11:56.988 --> 11:59.613
And Tom and I realized
you can't fight love.

11:59.628 --> 12:00.830
Oh, God.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.301
Is that what you two do together?
You sit around the house

12:03.317 --> 12:07.023
and talk about love?
I think... I'm gonna be sick.

12:07.038 --> 12:08.752
Okay, okay, look,

12:08.766 --> 12:10.433
I need you to wrap your
head around this, okay?

12:10.465 --> 12:12.390
Because it is happening.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.391
And I want you to
be my best man.

12:15.407 --> 12:18.082
What? No way.

12:22.615 --> 12:24.713
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

12:29.228 --> 12:31.013
I hope you change your mind.

12:37.028 --> 12:38.491
Two beers, one shot.

12:38.506 --> 12:41.000
Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.

12:44.545 --> 12:47.763
Oh, sweetie!
Did you make that for me?

12:49.176 --> 12:50.593
Yes.

12:52.466 --> 12:55.130
Clam Bake.
Staten Island. Who's in?

12:56.038 --> 12:58.702
Okay, I didn't have high
hopes for that one.

12:58.907 --> 13:00.600
Okay, here's my thing.

13:00.616 --> 13:02.263
If gay guys start
getting married,

13:02.275 --> 13:04.583
then suddenly the whole
world's gonna be doing it.

13:04.598 --> 13:06.190
That's how it works.
They start something,

13:06.227 --> 13:08.902
then six months later,
everyone follows.

13:08.917 --> 13:11.481
Like now everyone
gets manicures.

13:11.495 --> 13:12.842
I don't get manicures.

13:12.856 --> 13:15.983
Okay, then like how...
Like getting your chest waxed.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.671
You get your chest waxed?

13:17.685 --> 13:19.413
You know what I mean!

13:20.005 --> 13:22.352
Gay marriage is going
to cause single life,

13:22.366 --> 13:24.542
as we know it, to die out.

13:24.558 --> 13:28.012
Think of how the American
family will be strengthened.

13:28.028 --> 13:30.302
Barney, I'm sorry you're upset,
but you got to suck it up

13:30.318 --> 13:31.430
and be a man about this.

13:31.446 --> 13:32.483
No.

13:32.495 --> 13:36.201
It's always been me and him together,
being awesome,

13:36.215 --> 13:38.653
while the rest of
you walked two-by-two

13:38.668 --> 13:41.430
onto your ark of
sexless boredom.

13:41.447 --> 13:43.270
Just because James
is getting married

13:43.288 --> 13:45.080
doesn't mean things
are going to change.

13:45.096 --> 13:48.412
Yeah. Like things haven't
changed with you people.

13:49.526 --> 13:51.752
Look, my sister married
a guy I didn't like.

13:51.766 --> 13:54.183
Sandals and socks--
come on, buddy.

13:54.197 --> 13:56.340
But I took her out,
we celebrated.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.713
It was the right thing to do.

13:57.728 --> 13:59.472
You got to support him.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.282
You're right, Ted.

14:03.398 --> 14:06.131
This is a cause
for celebration.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.553
We need to take him out and
celebrate the commitment

14:09.565 --> 14:11.860
he and Tom are about to make.

14:14.538 --> 14:16.472
Yeah. This is where
we're celebrating

14:16.486 --> 14:19.001
the commitment that Tom
and I are about to make?

14:19.016 --> 14:20.330
What? Yeah!

14:20.347 --> 14:23.551
See, that cage represents
your commitment.

14:28.836 --> 14:32.780
Oh, my God. Freedom 
has never tasted so delicious.

14:32.858 --> 14:34.051
Hey.

14:34.065 --> 14:35.711
You work out?

14:35.777 --> 14:37.152
I do.

14:37.165 --> 14:38.952
And thank you for noticing.

14:38.966 --> 14:41.170
You're obviously in very
good shape yourself.

14:41.187 --> 14:42.740
Well, I try.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.351
So you want to dance?

14:44.697 --> 14:47.071
You know what?
I'm very flattered, and, objectively,

14:47.086 --> 14:50.251
you're a very attractive man,
but this is actually my fiancée.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.911
I'm sorry.
You know, I saw your drink and I...

14:52.925 --> 14:55.770
No, no, this isn't my drink.
This is hers.

14:55.787 --> 14:57.633
No, it isn't.

14:58.155 --> 14:59.490
Whatever.

14:59.507 --> 15:00.812
How 'bout you?

15:00.827 --> 15:02.382
Oh, I'm straight, too.

15:02.397 --> 15:04.330
But I thank you for your time,

15:04.345 --> 15:07.333
and I appreciate your
interest in my body.

15:09.478 --> 15:10.573
You see that?

15:10.585 --> 15:12.613
Being hit on doesn't
have to be terrible.

15:12.627 --> 15:15.792
I feel flattered,
and everyone left with their dignity.

15:17.976 --> 15:20.111
Hey, I really like
your sweater.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.873
Wow. You actually do,
don't you?

15:22.887 --> 15:25.322
You're not checking out
my boobs or anything.

15:25.338 --> 15:27.660
My name's Gay Ken,
what do you think?

15:27.677 --> 15:30.023
I love this place! Let's dance!

15:30.035 --> 15:32.670
- And not be groped!
- Whoo! Thank you.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.720
- Damn.
- Thank you!

15:38.967 --> 15:40.810
- We're hot.
- Totally.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.993
And then Tom says to the dealer

15:44.005 --> 15:47.793
that the handmade Georgian
clock has a chip on the corner.

15:47.805 --> 15:50.970
Blam, we get that puppy half price.
What up?!

15:50.986 --> 15:52.253
Bam!

15:53.148 --> 15:57.013
Sounds like you really rocked
that arts and crafts fair.

15:57.025 --> 15:58.410
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.303
Hey, oh, my God.
This is so liberating,

16:01.315 --> 16:03.490
being able to talk
about this to you.

16:03.508 --> 16:05.093
I cannot wait for
you to meet Tom.

16:05.105 --> 16:07.621
And I cannot wait for you
to meet my good friend...

16:07.635 --> 16:09.021
this guy.

16:09.285 --> 16:11.433
Excuse me, do you know anyone 
who would like to buy

16:11.445 --> 16:14.443
my incredibly muscular, fun,
large-handed brother a drink?

16:14.455 --> 16:18.413
Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you,
Barnaby. Okay.

16:19.698 --> 16:23.573
All right. I spy a group of women
who have let their defenses down

16:23.585 --> 16:25.400
because they are in a gay club.

16:25.416 --> 16:26.990
You see that chick right there?

16:27.037 --> 16:30.430
She looks like she'd fall for
sports agent and football player.

16:30.445 --> 16:31.810
Okay, I'm in.

16:31.826 --> 16:33.342
Which one am I?

16:33.668 --> 16:34.811
Please.

16:37.027 --> 16:39.622
He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil,
and drops his pants

16:39.636 --> 16:42.231
after three dirty martinis.
Now go, man, go!

16:47.418 --> 16:50.890
I just never thought I'd
see Barney so vulnerable.

16:50.906 --> 16:53.662
Well, I guess no one wants to feel like
they're going through the world alone.

16:53.697 --> 16:56.420
Look at me, 
in a yummy sandwich!

16:56.436 --> 16:59.572
Okay, we're actually right in the
middle of something right now, so...

16:59.585 --> 17:02.431
Ooh, I know what I want to be
in the middle of. Thoughts?

17:02.446 --> 17:04.830
God, can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,

17:04.847 --> 17:07.579
enjoy some techno and good
conversation without being bothered?

17:11.097 --> 17:14.133
How's it going, guys?
Still enjoying the attentions of men?

17:14.145 --> 17:16.972
That's like the eighth guy
who's hit on us in ten minutes.

17:16.986 --> 17:19.442
It's like, hello,
my eyes are up here.

17:19.457 --> 17:20.902
And  it's never the hot ones.

17:20.917 --> 17:23.232
It's always the losers.
Bums me out!

17:23.627 --> 17:25.790
Looks like the boys
learned their lesson.

17:25.806 --> 17:27.421
Do you totally
miss being hit on?

17:27.436 --> 17:29.230
Oh, totally.
Let's go find a sports bar.

17:30.927 --> 17:33.691
James, James,
since you like arts and crafts,

17:33.715 --> 17:37.320
look at what Charles here
made with cherry stems.

17:37.478 --> 17:39.211
He did it with his tongue.

17:39.227 --> 17:40.421
Yeah.

17:40.436 --> 17:41.143
Barney.

17:41.155 --> 17:44.433
So, Charles, why don't you put
your number in my brother's phone,

17:44.445 --> 17:45.650
and once he's in
a funner mood...

17:45.687 --> 17:47.503
Barney, Barney,
I don't want his number.

17:47.515 --> 17:50.321
I don't want anyone's
number, okay?

17:50.337 --> 17:51.830
I'm getting married.

17:51.898 --> 17:53.360
Wow.

17:53.418 --> 17:55.530
- Best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.

17:55.545 --> 17:57.110
My number's in here.

17:57.126 --> 17:58.861
I'm very discreet.

18:00.255 --> 18:01.961
Okay, okay, excuse me.

18:01.975 --> 18:03.710
Barney, family talk.

18:03.725 --> 18:05.881
Okay, dude,
you have got to stop this, okay?

18:05.896 --> 18:08.840
I know that my getting married is
threatening to your way of life...

18:08.855 --> 18:10.383
Oh, so now it's my way of life?

18:10.398 --> 18:12.570
I thought it was
our way of life.

18:12.585 --> 18:14.792
You've completely
turned your back on it.

18:14.808 --> 18:16.511
Look at you,
not even suited up.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.861
Do you remember why
we suit up, James?

18:18.878 --> 18:20.090
To get laid.

18:20.106 --> 18:22.150
To show people that
we are different

18:22.167 --> 18:25.590
from the millions of T-shirt
and jeans lemmings out there.

18:25.608 --> 18:28.190
The suit shows that we are
a force to be reckoned with,

18:28.206 --> 18:30.733
a two-person army that
plays by its own rules.

18:30.747 --> 18:33.252
But you've taken off the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,

18:33.265 --> 18:34.431
and you've abandoned me.

18:34.445 --> 18:35.800
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

18:35.838 --> 18:39.491
It's not too late to back out
of this stupid marriage thing!

18:39.506 --> 18:41.163
You don't have to do this, bro!

18:41.178 --> 18:42.432
- Yes, I do.
- Why?!

18:42.446 --> 18:45.050
Because Tom and I are
gonna have a baby.

18:45.075 --> 18:47.101
What? There's gonna be a baby?

18:48.645 --> 18:51.413
Yes. We're adopting.

18:51.537 --> 18:55.130
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be an uncle?

18:55.296 --> 18:57.031
For the rest of your life.

19:00.288 --> 19:03.003
And that's how Barney
became Uncle Barney.

19:03.055 --> 19:05.021
A year later,
at James's wedding,

19:05.036 --> 19:06.951
Barney could not have
been more proud.

19:06.966 --> 19:08.633
To James and Tom.

19:08.646 --> 19:11.211
May you have a long and
happy life together.

19:11.226 --> 19:14.433
And may I always have the skin
and libido of a much younger man.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.011
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:16.927 --> 19:18.190
Nice one.

19:18.645 --> 19:21.601
Thanks. I decided to leave
out the hetero college phase.

19:21.615 --> 19:23.022
No one wants to
hear about that.

19:23.035 --> 19:24.411
It was perfect.

19:24.428 --> 19:26.661
You even made Tom's dad cry.

19:26.677 --> 19:29.620
Might have been doing that
because he's a Republican.

19:30.846 --> 19:32.180
Whoa.

19:32.196 --> 19:33.670
It's 9:00.

19:33.687 --> 19:36.150
We should be getting back.
You guys want to split a cab?

19:36.165 --> 19:38.050
Uh, no, I think I'm gonna
stay a little bit longer.

19:38.085 --> 19:40.150
Yeah, me, too.
I'm not tired at all.

19:40.168 --> 19:42.461
All right, well, it's getting late.
Got to get the wife home.

19:42.497 --> 19:44.812
Oh, stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.

19:46.126 --> 19:48.643
Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.

20:03.198 --> 20:04.801
- May I?
- Yeah.

20:10.778 --> 20:12.541
Hey, buddy.

20:12.666 --> 20:14.683
Your parents are married.

20:15.087 --> 20:16.592
Now, listen, you.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.132
Just because you're being
raised by married people

20:19.146 --> 20:21.652
doesn't mean you have to
choose that lifestyle.

20:21.666 --> 20:22.793
High-five.

20:23.888 --> 20:25.771
Luckily, you got me.

20:25.938 --> 20:29.440
In 20 and a half years,
you'll be 21,

20:29.456 --> 20:31.301
and I will be...

20:31.657 --> 20:34.060
Well, I haven't decided
how old I'll be yet.

20:34.168 --> 20:38.422
But we are gonna bro out,
uncle and nephew style.

20:38.465 --> 20:40.101
Stick with me, kid.

20:40.118 --> 20:43.150
I am gonna teach
you how to live.

20:43.756 --> 20:46.301
Great suit, by the way.

20:49.688 --> 20:51.352
Who is the cutest?

20:58.448 --> 20:59.922
I don't get it.

20:59.965 --> 21:03.032
Tom liked my breasts
in tenth grade.

21:03.536 --> 21:06.011
Why doesn't he like them now?

21:06.828 --> 21:08.262
Why?

21:08.917 --> 21:12.502
Rosa, why always be attracted
to the unavailable ones?

21:12.518 --> 21:14.781
Why not accept the fact that
you're a beautiful woman

21:14.797 --> 21:16.822
who is worthy of love?

21:16.838 --> 21:19.113
Are you brave enough
to hear that?

21:19.256 --> 21:20.342
