WEBVTT

00:08.119 --> 00:09.849
Thanks for coming in
and sitting down with us.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.766
We're really excited to meet a few
good engineers to join the Pied Piper team.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.605
So, why don't you tell us
a little about yourself?

00:16.720 --> 00:18.722
I don't work before noon.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.809
Or after 2:00 p.m.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.248
And I need to bring my dog to work.
Are you dog-friendly?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.044
Oh, yeah, you can bring your dog to work.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.964
That's not what I asked.
Are you dog-friendly?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.241
Um...

00:33.320 --> 00:36.369
Nice pool. Can my dog go in?

00:36.440 --> 00:38.727
Yeah, yeah, we're very dog-friendly.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.565
Is there a lifeguard?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.047
Um...

00:42.120 --> 00:43.565
'Cause my dog can't swim.

00:43.640 --> 00:49.807
Now, it says here on your résumé that
from 2010 to 2011, you "crushed it"?

00:49.920 --> 00:50.887
That's actually an old résumé.

00:50.960 --> 00:55.204
It should also read
that I crushed it from 2013 to present.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.841
So, are we to understand
that you did not "crush it" in 2012?

00:58.920 --> 01:02.720
There was a medical situation preventing me
from crushing it to my usual standards.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.203
So, I had to take some time off
until I was able to crush it at 100%,

01:07.280 --> 01:10.409
at which point I resumed
crushing it full-time.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.043
So, it says here that
you're proficient in C++,

01:14.120 --> 01:18.011
code assembly
for multiple processor architectures,

01:18.080 --> 01:20.447
and that you are a cyborg?

01:20.680 --> 01:23.763
That is correct. Short
for cybernetic organism.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.207
I came into this world of filth and pain
with a congenital heart condition,

01:28.280 --> 01:33.525
requiring the installation of a pacemaker,
upon which I am mortally dependent.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.401
Mmm.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.930
Wow. He's technically a cyborg.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.004
Yeah, yeah. Makes the résumé accurate.

01:42.640 --> 01:46.281
Look, we all know
that I can make a shitload more money

01:46.360 --> 01:50.684
working for some multi-colored Happy Town
in a hermetically-sealed box.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.970
But permission to be honest?

01:53.720 --> 01:54.881
Permission granted.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.201
Granted.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.285
I like that you guys are so weird.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.561
Hmm.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.887
Yes, we are the weird ones.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.801
This morning,
you put your soda cans in the green one.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.803
Okay? That's not right.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.522
The green is for grass and leaves.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.245
Okay?

02:30.320 --> 02:32.243
The blue one is for recycling.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.206
Go ahead and put those in there.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.520
Yeah.

02:38.320 --> 02:42.450
Very good.
The black one is for all other trash.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.130
Do you understand?

02:45.200 --> 02:47.771
Yes. Which is for burning?

02:48.400 --> 02:52.928
No, we don't burn trash in this country.
It's illegal.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.770
You never burn trash.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.288
Okay, can you say that?
"I never burn trash."

02:58.360 --> 03:01.284
- I never burn trash.
- Yes.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.124
What about garbage?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.441
Motherfucker.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.763
Jared Patakian?

03:13.800 --> 03:18.362
You know, this Patakian guy
is definitely on some end of some spectrum,

03:18.480 --> 03:20.926
but he is a full-stack engineer.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.809
I mean, I'm sold. Jared, what do you think?

03:22.920 --> 03:25.924
Well, he's qualified
and he definitely seemed interested.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.570
It's a programmer's market right now.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.484
I think if we like him,
we should pursue him aggressively.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.884
My only concern here, and it's a small one,
urn, he's also named Jared.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.201
Will it be confusing with two Jareds?

03:37.320 --> 03:39.926
If we hire him, I can always go
back to my real name, Donald.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.725
No, that's too big a hassle.
We'll just go with Other Jared.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.086
OJ, for short.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.241
I know a name is just a sound
somebody makes when they need you,

03:47.320 --> 03:50.767
but shouldn't this much-newer Jared
be Other Jared?

03:50.840 --> 03:51.841
You should be flattered.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.009
O.J. Simpson is one of the most recognizable
people on the face of the planet.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.609
Was that Jared Patakian
I saw exiting the house?

03:59.680 --> 04:02.490
Yes, we just interviewed him.
We think he's great.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.928
He actually is great.
I tried to hire him for Aviato.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.571
But then he took the offer,
shopped it around town,

04:08.640 --> 04:10.244
and got more dough at a different gig.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.049
I didn't care for the
way that he handled it.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.648
So, I am going to have to err on the
side of caution and say, "Pass-adena,"

04:16.720 --> 04:17.880
Trina.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.689
Well, I'm sorry that that happened to you,
but you don't get to Pass-adena on anyone.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.923
We've got to hire a lot of people, and he
was the only one that we all agree on.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.129
But this is my house.
I'm on the board of this company.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.771
I mean, I must get dings, right?

04:33.840 --> 04:36.525
- Dings?
- Like in a jury or Whose Line Is It Anyway?

04:36.600 --> 04:40.127
Erlich, thank you
for letting us stay in your house

04:40.200 --> 04:42.931
while we figure out
what we need office-wise. Really.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.527
But I'm sorry. You don't get a say in this.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.881
We're going to hire the android.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.044
He's a cyborg, Richard.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.044
The son of a bitch is a goddamned cyborg.

04:56.840 --> 05:00.526
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
distinguished guests. Question.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.324
What is a moonshot?

05:03.720 --> 05:09.329
A moonshot is an idea so big,
so bold as to be impossible.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.606
Until it is not.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.170
Magellan circumnavigating...

05:12.240 --> 05:13.446
There you are.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.251
Oh, sorry, I got lost.
But I think I'm supposed to be here...

05:16.320 --> 05:17.321
Come on.

05:17.400 --> 05:22.406
Not so long ago, people called the idea
of sending a man to the Moon a moonshot.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.609
But we did it, and that
is just the beginning.

05:25.760 --> 05:31.085
No idea will be too big
for our newest division, Hooli XYZ.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.048
How long do I have to stay here?
'Cause lunch...

05:36.120 --> 05:37.360
Shh...

05:37.480 --> 05:42.122
And today, I'm pleased to announce that
after some negotiations and arm-twisting,

05:42.200 --> 05:45.170
the brilliant Professor Davis Bannerchek,

05:45.280 --> 05:48.363
a pioneer in robotics
and founder of Somerville Dynamics,

05:48.440 --> 05:51.171
has agreed to head up this new division.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.408
I give you Dr. Bannerchek,

05:53.480 --> 05:57.963
the one and only man fit to be the
first head dreamer of Hooli XYZ.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.207
Also, I give you the one and only man
fit to be his co-head dreamer,

06:09.280 --> 06:13.080
our very own Nelson Bighetti,
otherwise known around here as Baghead.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.162
- Come on up here, Baghead.
- What?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.566
He also co-founded Pied Piper
right here at Hooli.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.924
I'm not sure I understand.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.681
You are being promoted.

06:34.760 --> 06:39.926
Being named co-head dreamer
carries with it a significant pay increase,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.810
greater equity,
more favorable vesting schedule.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.924
See, but I really like the job I had.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.568
You know, I was perfectly happy there.

06:48.640 --> 06:54.647
It was kind of the perfect level
of involvement for me, I think.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.768
And also, that other guy, Bannerchek, he
did not really seem to like me very much.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.288
Oh, he does not. And he wanted you to know

07:03.400 --> 07:08.930
that he moved four school-aged children
and his elderly mother across the country

07:09.000 --> 07:13.210
in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.329
He was very clear about that.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.200
And he wanted me to convey that to you.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.961
Have I done that?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.526
Yeah. So, what is my job exactly?

07:24.760 --> 07:29.288
Well, that's actually... That's up to you.
You can do whatever you want.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.526
Okay. See, that's sort of
what I do now, though.

07:33.640 --> 07:38.965
But starting today, you can do it
in a much more significant way.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.161
So, enjoy your new office.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.804
Wait, this is my office?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.482
Sorry to interrupt. The
photographer's here.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.085
Photographer?

07:52.200 --> 07:55.044
From WIRED magazine,
for the profile they're doing on you.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.240
Sorry, who are you?

07:57.880 --> 07:59.450
Your assistant.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.725
What?

08:05.160 --> 08:07.925
Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.844
Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone
you guys recommended I contact,

08:10.920 --> 08:11.887
Carla Walton?

08:11.960 --> 08:14.884
Yeah, we hung out with her a bunch
at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.610
Her code is fucking great.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.251
She was head of engineering at EarCast?

08:19.320 --> 08:23.245
She was engineering at EarCast.
She built that whole system on her own.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.651
You know what else excites me here?

08:24.720 --> 08:28.645
There's a distinct over-representation
of men in this company. Look around.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.527
I think it would behoove us
to prioritize hiring a woman.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.567
I disagree, OJ.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.644
We should hire
the best person for the job, period.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.960
And Carla is one of the best.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.451
Right, let me rephrase.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.841
I think having a woman in the company
is important,

08:41.919 --> 08:44.605
but hiring someone
only because they're a woman is bad.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.126
I would never compromise Pied Piper.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.725
Okay, just to be clear,

08:48.840 --> 08:52.322
our top priority is to hire
the most qualified person available, right?

08:52.400 --> 08:53.606
Of course.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.803
But it would be better
if that someone was a woman

08:56.880 --> 08:59.929
even though the "woman" part
of that statement is irrelevant?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.085
Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles
and now we just need Yoko.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.925
That's the worst example
you could have used.

09:07.240 --> 09:12.406
I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using
WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.723
So, basically,
I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream

09:15.800 --> 09:17.484
and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.242
The users pay for all that bandwidth,
not you? Wow.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.091
That could save us a ton of money.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.685
Yeah, a shit ton.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.527
And do you think you could integrate it into
our platform by January in time for CES?

09:30.600 --> 09:31.931
Look, I'm not going to get in your way.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.651
You know, you design the engine.
I just assemble the car.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.724
I could have an alpha of that up
in a solid weekend of hacking.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.564
Wow. Cool.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.648
Plus, I could count on one hand
the number of people on Earth

09:41.720 --> 09:45.122
who could handle sitting in a room
with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...

09:45.320 --> 09:46.401
All of that.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.931
Plus, you're a woman.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.721
What?

09:50.560 --> 09:54.121
No, I just mean we would absolutely love
to have a strong woman working here.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.080
I'm not a woman "engineer."
I'm an engineer.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.408
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Okay, no, no.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.209
Oh, no, yes, of course.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.363
We want to hire the best people
who happen to be women,

10:05.440 --> 10:07.124
regardless of whether
or not they are women.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.770
That part is irrelevant.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.921
Are you doing that interviewing thing

10:10.000 --> 10:12.207
where you try to rattle somebody
to see if they freak out or not?

10:12.600 --> 10:15.809
Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.609
I wouldn't know how to do that.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.609
Well, I am aggressively
unemployed right now.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.405
So, why don't you give me a call
when you know what you want to do?

10:22.480 --> 10:23.447
- Great.
- All right.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.642
Great. All right, I'll show you out.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.927
Oh, lucky me.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.008
I loved
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.561
So?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.966
So, she's actually bad-ass.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.246
Yeah, we told you, right?

10:39.560 --> 10:40.641
We have to hire that person.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.245
Are you shitting me?

10:43.680 --> 10:45.409
You see this, Richard? What is this?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.241
A Spoon?

10:47.320 --> 10:51.928
It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only
spoon type that is left in this drawer.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.810
I specifically posted a note
on the refrigerator saying

10:56.880 --> 11:01.761
that the more narrow spoons be reserved
for the eating for Fage yogurt by me.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.887
Look at this.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.406
The angle's all wrong.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.801
Aren't you supposed
to just tip that little plastic cup part up

11:07.880 --> 11:09.245
and dump the jam into the yogurt?

11:09.400 --> 11:12.131
How would you know that?
Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?

11:12.200 --> 11:13.850
No, I saw it on the billboards.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.366
Well, what they don't tell
you on the billboards

11:16.440 --> 11:18.169
is that you can't get all of it out.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.647
Look at that! You have to dig it out.

11:20.720 --> 11:25.442
But you can't dig it out with these
big-as-hell, wide fucking spoons.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.921
This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?

11:28.040 --> 11:29.883
This is about Jared Patakian.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.766
This is about me not letting you tell me
who I can or can't hire.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.726
Or maybe it's about the fact that you're
the one who's been using my narrow spoons?

11:37.840 --> 11:38.887
Okay.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.889
You and I both have to get ready
for a board meeting.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.610
Can we just stop with the nonsense?

11:42.720 --> 11:43.721
- Nonsense?
- Yeah.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.802
- This is nonsense?
- Yeah.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.888
You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused

11:48.960 --> 11:51.042
because one quarter of the jam
can't come out.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.451
Thank you for hosting.
You have a lovely home.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.521
Yeah, I do.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.323
I like this painting.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.447
Is it sperm?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.284
No, three commas.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.964
Know what has three commas in it, Richard?

12:04.040 --> 12:06.725
Uh... A sentence with two
appositive phrases in it?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.411
No, a billion dollars.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.731
Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.565
You know, you play your cards right,
you could be in the three-comma club, too.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.849
But probably not. But you could be.
But probably not.

12:17.920 --> 12:18.921
There she is.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.970
Say hello to tonight's fifth board member,
my girlfriend Nastia.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.041
Charmed.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.360
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.041
Hello.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.681
Ah!

12:28.600 --> 12:29.681
You are Jew.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.364
Episcopalian, actually.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.522
Jew, good at business.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.443
My baby's got some ideas about Jews,

12:35.800 --> 12:38.849
some good, some bad.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.685
- Cool, cool.
- Dad?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.522
Oh! Hey there, buddy.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.601
Hello.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.762
Who's this? Another board member?

12:46.840 --> 12:49.844
Aspen, it's time for bed.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.565
I don't want to go to bed.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.451
I'm sorry, buddy. It's not up to me.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.524
I need you to cooperate, Aspen.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.604
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

13:02.680 --> 13:04.011
Fine.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.401
...four, three... Good boy, Aspen.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.005
What the hell is that?

13:08.080 --> 13:09.764
Company I'm funding. We call it The Lady.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.322
I press a button, and The Lady tells Aspen
when it's time for bed, time to take a bath,

13:13.400 --> 13:14.811
when his fucking mother's here
to pick him up.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.531
I get to be his friend
and she's the bad guy.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.809
I've disrupted fatherhood.
It's visionary technology.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.445
Okay, come on. Board meeting, bitches.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.490
Aspen, remember to take your medication.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.724
Hey. Just remember,
Russ only has two board seats.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.246
So, as long as we vote together,
we can carry every vote.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.401
Yeah, I'm familiar
with the rules of a board meeting.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.561
Okay.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.724
Okay, so, 409A valuation report
and new ESOPs.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.007
Is there a motion to approve?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.884
Great, it's unanimous. Approved.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.245
Now we need to clear the equity packages we're
offering to a couple prospective hires,

14:01.120 --> 14:03.851
Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.605
Fucking cyborg.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.002
Oh, um, Patakian is actually
a solid engineer.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.606
We'd be foolish not to hire him.

14:11.680 --> 14:15.526
He's really good. So, all in favor?

14:17.280 --> 14:18.611
Sounds like a good pick-up.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.328
Okay, four-to-one approved.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.890
All right, is there anything else
we need to cover?

14:27.960 --> 14:32.727
Yeah, I think we need to talk about
getting some schwag.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.007
What?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.601
- Schwag!

14:37.680 --> 14:39.125
Schwag!

14:40.400 --> 14:42.368
- What is it?
- Schwag.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.925
- Swag?
- Schwag!

14:44.000 --> 14:45.001
What is it?

14:45.080 --> 14:46.081
Schwag.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.166
I actually don't know...

14:48.280 --> 14:51.045
I think we need to build on the success
of our outdoor media campaign.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.243
I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads,
puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.

14:54.320 --> 14:59.008
Come on, I'm talking 30 grand. That's
like a hand of blackjack. All in favor?

15:02.800 --> 15:04.529
I mean, first billboards, now this?

15:04.600 --> 15:08.241
I... As it is,
we're barely going to make it to January.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.481
Sorry.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.881
What?

15:15.960 --> 15:19.521
I think it's a really solid idea.
I think we'd be foolish not to do it.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.047
Cool. So, three-to-two in favor. Schwag!

15:24.120 --> 15:27.010
I'll set you guys up with my marketing
company. We'll give you a killer rate.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.401
Question, who likes margaritas?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.369
Answer, everybody!

15:31.440 --> 15:33.442
Babe, go out back,
grab some limes from the tree, all right?

15:34.480 --> 15:36.642
Who likes schwag? This guy, this guy.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.848
We gonna get our schwag on!

15:40.200 --> 15:44.524
What the fuck are you doing?
You just cost us $30,000.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.285
I thought
we agreed to present a unified front here.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.806
Well, if Richard wants a unified front,

15:49.880 --> 15:53.123
then maybe Richard
should do a better job at unifying it.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.645
Why are you such a dick?

15:54.720 --> 15:57.769
Why are you unable to listen to people
who know what they're talking about?

15:57.840 --> 16:00.844
Speaking of Mexico,
I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow,

16:00.920 --> 16:02.570
but I got roped into
buying these two tickets

16:02.640 --> 16:05.644
to the Muir Woods preservation thing
tomorrow night.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.485
Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.643
Gonna be a lot of members
of the three-comma club there. Am I right?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.200
Total asshole parade.
Anyone want these stupid things?

16:14.280 --> 16:16.169
Yeah, I'm down.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.770
Uh, and, Richard, no, you can't come.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.205
- But, Monica...
- No.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.281
Okay.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.364
Hey, babe. Babe, I said limes. Limes.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.211
She's honestly
so fucking stupid.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.126
Yeah.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.089
She doesn't even know
what I'm saying right now.

16:39.080 --> 16:43.768
And until we get real office space,
I guess we could just put you right here.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.649
And we could put Patakian here.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.927
I hope you don't mind
sitting next to a cyborg.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.764
Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?

16:49.840 --> 16:51.126
Well, he is a coder.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.886
Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough
to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...

16:57.120 --> 16:59.930
You know, if it's cool, I'm going to get
some stuff out of my car to dump here.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.368
I know I don't start till Monday, but I want
to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.521
You're getting a new car?

17:04.599 --> 17:07.171
Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.362
- It's pretty dope.
- That sounds expensive.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.726
- Guys?
- It is.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.445
Richard has something
very important to tell you.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.131
Yes.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.845
So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,

17:19.920 --> 17:21.843
I need to be able
to answer any questions that you might have

17:21.920 --> 17:25.641
about Pied Piper's harassment policy
and workplace code of conduct.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.883
Apparently, every company our size
has to have one of those.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.407
So, essentially, if you find the
workplace hostile in any way,

17:32.480 --> 17:35.404
you can submit a written complaint.
It will be completely anonymous.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.643
Essentially, don't do or say anything
that might offend anyone.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.882
Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.803
- Okay.
- Guys, um,

17:43.800 --> 17:45.689
this is actually pretty serious.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.570
I mean, we're all cool here,
but we know each other.

17:48.640 --> 17:52.326
So, obviously,
when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.562
or he describes me as AIDS Lady,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.564
or Gilfoyle refers to me
as effeminate k.d. Lang,

17:57.680 --> 17:59.921
I know this is a joke among friends.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.764
- It's not a joke.
- We're not friends.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.842
See, it's hilarious.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.925
But, um, as we grow,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.243
we're going to be adding a lot of new
people to this company and to this office,

18:10.320 --> 18:14.450
and some of them might not be
as amused as I am by such strong language.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.091
Lawsuits happen. So, questions?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.682
- Oh, uh, I have a question.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.762
My best friend's nickname is Cunty.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.127
- I'm sorry, her name is...
- Cunty.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.362
And I was hoping I could call her Cunty
while I'm here.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.442
Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.921
'Cause, you know, I want to have
Cunty come visit me for lunch,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.968
and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"

18:33.040 --> 18:36.089
then it's like, I'm not going
to want to have Cunty over at all,

18:36.600 --> 18:38.921
which I feel, like, kind
of violates my rights.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.968
Yeah. Um, it does not...

18:41.040 --> 18:42.041
As a woman.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.123
Okay, I'm going to have
to get back to you on that one.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.645
Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.085
- Okay.
- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen

18:51.160 --> 18:53.481
- so we can...
- Okay, okay, okay.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.123
All right, I'm going to go
clean out my shit box.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.087
Nice bag.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.281
Thank you.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.761
Oh, look, D&G. It's like
Dinesh & Gilfoyle. So, yeah.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.326
Okay, that was the third reference
she's made to how much money she's making.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.324
That's a $3,500 bag.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.971
How do you know? You have the same one?

19:21.040 --> 19:23.441
No, I have the fucking Internet.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.727
Hey, you don't think she's making
more money than us, do you?

19:25.800 --> 19:28.201
No, we all have equalized pay, remember?

19:28.280 --> 19:32.171
Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,
but not new hires.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.130
It's the classic dilemma
where the founders make less.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.726
We told Richard to get her
no matter what it took.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.531
Even if she is making more cash than us,
which she isn't,

19:40.600 --> 19:42.364
there's no way she has as much equity.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.125
You don't know that. And Richard
won't tell us. It's confidential.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.440
I guess there's a reason for it.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.602
It's so people don't get jealous
and throw a hissy fit.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.651
I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure
she's making less than me.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.882
Hey, how do we find out
how much she's getting paid here?

19:55.280 --> 19:56.406
I have a plan.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.047
Hey, Carla,
how much money do you make here?

20:04.760 --> 20:07.127
Uh, Let's just say
it's a big jump from my old job.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.841
Right, but you probably
got more equity there.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.563
Um, no, actually I get more equity here.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.687
What?

20:14.760 --> 20:16.683
Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?

20:16.760 --> 20:18.205
Three points each.

20:18.320 --> 20:22.325
Three? That's weird.
I thought you got in at the beginning.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.249
I have another plan.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.248
All right, Jian Yang,
don't talk to anybody else.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.845
When we get inside, don't talk to me.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.443
- Good evening.
- Here's the...

20:38.120 --> 20:39.724
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.400
And how will you be paying, sir?

20:46.080 --> 20:47.605
- Excuse me?
- Your donation.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.011
What's your preferred method of payment?

20:49.280 --> 20:50.281
Oh...

20:50.360 --> 20:53.125
No, these are already paid for.
We're guests of Russ Hanneman.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.847
Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,
but you have to pay for them.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.810
Oh. Uh...

20:58.880 --> 21:00.086
Okay. And how much are they?

21:00.160 --> 21:01.321
$25,000.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.243
Um... So... But for both?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.446
No, no, no, per ticket.

21:04.520 --> 21:08.730
There's no possible way that
we could pay that, so what do we do here?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.724
Well, there are a number of other ways
to help preserve the Muir Woods.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.723
We do a volunteer clean-up program
every weekend.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.370
Yeah, I don't give a shit
about the Muir Woods.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.283
I need to get in there.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.409
Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,
I really don't see how that's possible.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.960
What if we do, like, a
little in-and-out thing?

21:23.040 --> 21:27.682
I just go in there, 10 minutes, you know,
have one cocktail, two, three max.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.808
- He doesn't eat. He won't eat.
- Yes, I'm hungry.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.406
Gentlemen, I'm going to need you
to move aside for the other guests.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.887
You want me to email
Russ Hanneman right now?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.610
You don't have Russ's email.

21:36.680 --> 21:42.483
But I have his... I have the phone number
of the person who works in his office.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.289
Does anybody have an extra ticket?
My investor cannot pay.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.331
That's actually not true. Uh... I think
they must have misplaced the tickets.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.164
No, we have everyone's tickets here.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.608
Can you please check? Erlich Bachman?

21:55.680 --> 21:58.160
E-R-I-C-H...

21:58.240 --> 21:59.651
That's not at all how it's spelled here.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.006
All right. Let's go, Jian.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.286
Have a nice night. Thank you.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.850
- Let's go. Come on. Come on.
- Next.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.126
- Excuse me...
- Come on. Let's go.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.851
- ...do you have a ticket?
- God damn it! Jian Yang, come here!

22:08.360 --> 22:09.407
Do you have a ticket?

22:16.240 --> 22:18.481
Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.569
It was sad.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.610
Erlich, he promised me dinner
with a big meet.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.841
Big meat?

22:24.920 --> 22:27.241
- Big meet people.
- Meat people?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.923
Then people say, "No, you can't come in."

22:31.440 --> 22:32.771
Wait, so you guys didn't get in?

22:32.920 --> 22:35.207
We went to Taco Bell.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.489
Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.527
He tried to blame the taco sauce.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.362
- Richard?
- Yes.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.886
- OJ says you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.280
Um...

22:50.360 --> 22:53.728
I don't want to say this,
any of this, at all,

22:54.600 --> 22:58.571
but several employees
have lodged a complaint against you.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.766
For what?

22:59.960 --> 23:01.405
Um...

23:01.480 --> 23:03.244
For making this a hostile workplace.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.284
By, quote,
"Repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces

23:06.360 --> 23:09.887
"in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a
pussy who gave a new hire more than us."

23:09.960 --> 23:10.961
Mmm-hmm.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.245
Interesting.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.085
And which two of the several
lodged a complaint?

23:16.160 --> 23:19.642
Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,
so I can't tell you that.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.604
Look, you and I both know
how much you make.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.570
- Are you fucking with them?
- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.211
I bought a fake Dolce & Gabbana bag
at a swap meet to piss them off

23:28.280 --> 23:29.281
and apparently it did.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.524
And I lied and said I
was getting a Mercedes.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.446
I also left a fake credit-card statement open
on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.567
- Did they see it?
- They saw it.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.801
- Yeah, sweet.
- Okay.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.087
- Carla.
- Okay, all right.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.482
But what I used to do to fuck with them
involved gay porn and Photoshop,

23:43.560 --> 23:48.088
so I don't think that would be cool
after OJ's big harassment speech.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.211
Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.409
Well, I... Can we not do any of it?

23:54.480 --> 23:57.723
It just that they're getting really pissed
and it's really distracting.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.611
All right.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.283
- No more Cunty.
- Terrific.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.964
- That's really good.
- Cunty's done.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.726
Great. But you said it again,
but maybe that's the last time.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.809
Cunty's done. I'm gonna
call you OJ, though.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.006
- Yeah, that's fine.
- That's for good.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.525
Yeah, yeah, because in my head,

24:14.640 --> 24:18.122
I change the meaning from "Other Jared" to
"Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.

24:18.440 --> 24:23.321
If I have to, I'm going to keep my
fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!

24:23.440 --> 24:26.808
It doesn't take an IQ-9
to know they should remain alphabetized.

24:26.880 --> 24:31.602
I want to watch a specific episode.
And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!

24:46.560 --> 24:51.487
Hey, um, Erlich,
I just want to say this is your house

24:51.560 --> 24:54.166
and you've been really cool
letting us stay here for all this time,

24:54.240 --> 24:56.925
and as soon as we get our office space,
we'll be out of your way.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.127
And how soon is that going to be?

25:00.800 --> 25:01.926
Soon.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.841
And look, I realize it's not fair
that I bring someone into your house

25:05.920 --> 25:07.126
that you don't want here,

25:08.200 --> 25:11.522
so I will call the cyborg
and I will rescind the offer.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.969
You know, Richard, I've been thinking,
the cyborg is a solid coder.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.246
You should hire him.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.004
It's fine, I'll get someone else.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.451
Don't be stupid, Richard.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.729
You need a full working beta up
in the next few months. Just hire the guy.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.122
I'm not being stupid, okay?
I'm not going to hire him.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.885
And frankly, I'm not going to let you
bully me into doing it.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.201
Would you look at yourself?
You're still not fucking listening to me.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.203
No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.726
If you want to respect me,
then just hire the piece of shit.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.801
Don't act like a moron.

25:37.880 --> 25:41.089
You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass
acting like a fucking moron.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.640
You don't get to tell me
how I respect you, okay?

25:43.720 --> 25:46.564
I can respect you however the fuck I want.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.207
What are you doing?

25:50.280 --> 25:52.009
I'm respecting you.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.123
Jared, hey, it's, uh,
Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.050
Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...

26:06.000 --> 26:07.081
What?

26:08.480 --> 26:09.925
What's that?

26:11.560 --> 26:12.721
Where?

26:15.640 --> 26:16.880
Okay.

26:16.960 --> 26:21.602
Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...

26:21.680 --> 26:24.445
- Metal-dick piece of shit.
- Metal-dick piece of shit.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.521
Ha-ha-ha.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.601
What happened?

26:29.320 --> 26:31.243
He took another job

26:32.520 --> 26:34.284
from Russ fucking Hanneman.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.885
- What?
- Yeah.

26:35.960 --> 26:39.407
Apparently, I said so much
nice shit about him in the board meeting,

26:39.480 --> 26:43.371
Russ offered him a job at one of his other
fucking companies for a lot more money.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.488
Our own investor poached him.

26:45.720 --> 26:49.042
And he went? Fucking cyborg.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.041
Richard! You need to come see this.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.328
What event could this possibly be used at?

27:08.040 --> 27:09.565
Are you happy?

27:10.360 --> 27:11.486
Not really.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.483
They used the old logo.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.087
Do you smell something burning?

27:17.160 --> 27:18.889
God damn it! Jian Yang!
