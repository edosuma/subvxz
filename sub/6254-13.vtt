I want the kids to see.

Well, it’s a little jiggly.

- Then again, so is—
— Don’t you dare, Marty!

00:17.143 --> 00:21.807
Oh. If we cut across the field,
we can beat the others
to the river!

It’s a tour, Ruth.
It’s not a competition.

Of course, come on.
Why wouldn’t he be?

Daisy is
an excellent intern.
Theyjust broke up.

Right.

You believe he hasn’t yet
recovered emotionally...

01:21.540 --> 01:24.077

of finding an apartment?

Yeah.

Have you had sex
with another woman yet?

— Bones, we don’t have
to really discuss—
— It’s a valid question.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.818
I’m staying in Parker’s room.
Kind of hard to
bring home a woman...

Parker’s gonna want
to come home someday.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.627
Oh, I got to tell you.
Kind of hard to feel bad...

02:13.718 --> 02:16.630
for anybody who’d ride around
on a glorified scooter—
Whoa!

02:16.721 --> 02:19.884
There are signs of rodent
predation— squirrels and rats.

02:19.974 --> 02:24.308
First rodents, then maggots,
then the magnificent
rove beetles.

02:24.395 --> 02:27.228
It’s the circle of life.
Nothing is more beautiful.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.930
Okay, well,
I’m all choked up here.

02:29.025 --> 02:32.563
Not much tissue left,
but enough for a tox screen
and analysis.

Brow ridge suggests
female Caucasian.

02:35.281 --> 02:38.944
The wear on the mandibular teeth
puts her in her early 30s.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.822
Kind of in the middle
of nowhere.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.413
I’m thinking sexual assault.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.237
Hard to tell until
we get her back to the lab,

02:45.333 --> 02:50.703
but I am seeing lacerations
and avulsions to the tissue
on the radius and the ulna.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.128
Maybe she was killed
someplace else and
brought here to be buried.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.582
It’s a shallow grave.
It’s a perfect place
for a body dump.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.585
Whoa, what’s that?

03:01.098 --> 03:03.555
Someone must have thought
it was an excellent place.

03:04.477 --> 03:06.433
There’s another body
in this grave.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.446
[ Brennan ] The chest cavity
on the first body we found
shows massive trauma...

03:18.532 --> 03:23.196
to the body of the sternum
and the bilateral fourth, fifth
and sixth sternal ribs.

03:23.287 --> 03:27.200
Including areas where
the periosteum is absent,
having abraded away.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.203
— Very good, Ms. Wick.
- Crushing fractures
at the point of impact...

03:30.294 --> 03:33.001

Great minds.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.214
I beg your pardon?
It’s like we’re operating
as one organism.

03:41.305 --> 03:44.593
Perhaps, if you view us
as a quantum physicist might.

03:44.683 --> 03:45.934
That would be fine.

03:46.060 --> 03:50.554
Are you all right,
Ms. Wick?
Of course. Why?

that you may be
a little anxious...

03:53.150 --> 03:55.687

dropping by the lab.

03:55.778 --> 03:59.316
Absolutely not.
I’m an emotional rock,
just like Dr. Brennan.

Well, I hope so.

to your... ex...

he can put this burial
in a psychological context.

Hmm.

All right, all right.
What I mean to say is,

05:01.177 --> 05:03.384
the body was
arranged.
Right.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.382
Staged,
if you will.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.805
Now, the scarf
was placed under her chin,

05:07.892 --> 05:09.803
tied at the top of her head
to keep herjaw closed.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.852
Also, Hodgins confirmed that
the body was anointed...

05:12.938 --> 05:16.055
with sandalwood,
frankincense and cloves.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.731
You know,
you ever hear of green burials?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.901
Is that the, urn,
alternative death movement?

05:20.988 --> 05:23.445
No embalming, no coffin,
no cemetery?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.523
There it is. This company
called Green Passages.

05:25.618 --> 05:28.360
What they did is they leased
this burial site
from the national park...

05:28.454 --> 05:30.240
for a woman by the name
of Monica Craig.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.538
“Recycling your loved ones’
remains back into nature.”

05:32.625 --> 05:35.162
Da—da—da.
“More natural and
involved grieving process.”

05:35.294 --> 05:38.457

But there should only be
one body there, not two.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.795

Yep.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.589

we got to get all the names...

05:42.676 --> 05:45.463

where Monica Craig was buried.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.587

Oh, I’m doing that.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.636

that buries people...

06:08.285 --> 06:11.368
without embalming or coffins,
because it’s more natural.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.366
That’s true,
it is more natural.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.199

Hodgins that.

“desecrated” mean?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.166

burial site to bury a body.

Where’s Monica now?
In the ensuing
invesﬂgaﬂon,

07:13.392 --> 07:15.804
her remains have been moved
to the Jeffersonian Institution.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.022
This is the opposite
of what Monica wanted.

— She was Monica’s death doula.

at Green Passages.

08:16.372 --> 08:18.579

before Monica died.

08:21.752 --> 08:25.085
You know, I thought that doulas
were for birth, not death.

08:25.172 --> 08:29.006
Doula is the feminine version of
the ancient Greek word “doulos,”

08:29.093 --> 08:31.209
which means servant
or caregiver.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.510

Rachel Knox was the one...

08:33.597 --> 08:36.304

through her last days.

08:36.392 --> 08:38.303
You know, after death
she washed her body,

08:38.394 --> 08:40.760

out for three days.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.346

10:40.307 --> 10:41.922
Aaron, it’s okay.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.882
Practicing... to be dead?

10:43.977 --> 10:47.265
This is, um—
You know, death is a difficult
topic in our culture,

10:47.356 --> 10:51.395
and practice and preparation
demystifies the process, so—

10:51.485 --> 10:53.476
You must be the director
of Green Passages.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.186
- Akshay Mirza, yes.
- Is he, like, the death doula?

10:59.034 --> 11:02.117
Okay.
Well, we’re also here
about the end of a life.

11:02.204 --> 11:06.117
Your associate,
Rachel Knox, is dead.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.499
I can’t believe
that Rachel is gone.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.379
Uh, she was your
business partner?

11:18.470 --> 11:20.847
Uh,yeah,yeah.
We’d been doing this
for about two years.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.092
She was found dead yesterday
in one of your grave sites.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.390
One of our sites?
Are you sure?

11:25.477 --> 11:26.762
Yes.
Monica Craig’s.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.553
Oh, God.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.811
Uh, wait.
Are you sure it was Rachel?
You’re positive?

11:32.901 --> 11:37.361
The mandible
and dental evidence
confirm her identity.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.610
Okay. Okay.

11:41.910 --> 11:45.118
I don’t know what
I’m going to do without—

11:45.205 --> 11:47.241
I got to sit.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.328
You okay?
Thoughtyou,uh,

11:50.460 --> 11:54.203
dealt with death
all the time.
Not for someone I know.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.505
This is a first for me.

11:56.592 --> 11:59.550
And take deep breaths
through your nose...

11:59.636 --> 12:01.797
to avoid
hyperventilation.

12:01.889 --> 12:06.883
You know, we are told that
existence is impermanent
and conditional,

12:06.977 --> 12:09.889
and that the pain
that we feel is just
a natural product of that.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.392
Right. Okay.
She was, uh, murdered,
uh, three weeks ago.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.355
Why didn’t you
report her missing?
Oh, no, no.

12:14.443 --> 12:17.901
No, Rachel disappeared
all the time.
It’s who she was.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.900
That must have
made you angry, huh?
Her being away all the time.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.481
It must have been bad
for business.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.693
No, no. It allowed Rachel
to connect more fully
to her clients.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.574
And business was growing.
It was up 60%
from last year to this.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.532
Her death appears to
have been extremely violent.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.458
Can you think of anyone
who’d want to hurt her?

12:33.545 --> 12:37.754
Hurt her? No. God, no.
No, no. Rachel was loved.

12:37.841 --> 12:42.130
She wouldn’t take on a client
unless she could give herself
over completely to them.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.256
Okay, well,
if you can think of anyone
who wanted to hurt her—

12:44.348 --> 12:47.465
ex—boyfriend, a client—
you can just
give me a call.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.936
- There’s my card.
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
— Sure.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.055
Let’s go, Bones.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.855
We have to go now,
Mr. Mirza.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.026
Could I have my hand back?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.655
I don’t know
how I’m going to get
through this without Ra—

13:13.251 --> 13:15.207
[ Daisy]
Dr. Hodgins, I’d like you
to take a look at this.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.831
See the comminuted
fracture...

13:17.923 --> 13:19.788
at the distal end
of the sternal body,

13:19.883 --> 13:21.748
just superior to
the xiphisternal joint?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.299
She was really crushed.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.298
A blow this hard is likely
the cause of death.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.176
It would push the sternum
back into the heart.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.303
And if, in that second,
the ventricle was filled
to maximum capacity,

13:31.395 --> 13:32.885
the bone
would pop the heart.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.096
The bone was like a pin
in a balloon.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.726
More like a stick of
dynamite in a balloon.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.933
Given the amount ofjagged
edges on the fracturing,

13:39.069 --> 13:40.559
I thought—
There might be some
particulates in there.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.019
Yeah, okay.
I’ll take a look.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.479
I’m hoping that this
is more productive...

13:43.573 --> 13:44.983
than pulverizing
the rove beetles,

13:45.075 --> 13:47.441
because the mass spec
showed nothing.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.903
You seem good,
like you’re totally okay
after breaking up with Sweets.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.831
I am. Now that
I’m focusing solely
on my career in science,

13:53.917 --> 13:55.418
lbeHeve
my life is together.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.164
Well, thank God, because
there is nothing more painful...

13:58.255 --> 14:00.667
than watching an ex—couple
do the awkward dance.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.669
I assure you,
I’ll handle seeing Lance
in a professional way.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.591
Or you’ll want to stab him.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.170
I mean, he did dump you
on the night you were
going to move in together.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.550
I’m not a child,
Dr. Hodgins.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.139
No, ljust thought—
I’m sure you did.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.309
But idle gossip is not
going to help us
solve this murder.

14:14.396 --> 14:17.980
Perhaps a bone scraping
would provide a more detailed
analysis than a swab.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.931
You could analyze
your findings using...

14:20.027 --> 14:23.064
not only under stereo,
compound and polarizing
microscopes,

14:23.155 --> 14:25.020
but also using
an energy dispersive X-ray.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.071
That’s what Dr. Brennan
would do as well.

14:27.159 --> 14:30.868
Wow.
You really have pulled
yourself together.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.411
You’re welcome,
Dr. Hodgins.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.792
Well, Sweets said
that Dr. Craig...

14:39.880 --> 14:42.246
just filed a lawsuit
against Green Passages...

14:42.340 --> 14:44.126
for desecration
of his wife’s grave,

14:44.217 --> 14:46.173
which I cannot say
that I blame him for.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.876
Booth is checking
with their other clients...

14:47.971 --> 14:50.178
to see if anyone else
had a problem with them.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.052
Hmm. None of the other
burial sites were disturbed.

14:53.143 --> 14:58.354
He thinks that maybe
Rachel wasn’t quite
as saintly as Akshay said.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.977
Looks like this
death business
can be lethal, huh?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.810
[Laughs]
That is amusing.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.441
Because we’re
investigating a murder.

15:06.573 --> 15:11.237
Right.
The juxtaposition
of funerals and a killing—

15:11.369 --> 15:14.076
[Laughs]
Most people would
just laugh, sweetie.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.745
I’m sor/y

15:15.832 --> 15:17.868
Checked out all lawsuits
that were filed
against Green Passages.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.502
There’s Dr. Craig’s—
Understandable.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.043
and three other suits
that were filed
by this guy, Mick Warren.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.337
Three?
Did he have a burial
site desecrated too?

15:24.424 --> 15:28.713
No. He owned two cemeteries.
And all the suits
named Rachel Knox individually.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.710
Fraud, breach of promise.
Angry stuff.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.712
Yeah, he was trying
to put her out of business.
Hmm.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.761
But you’re thinking,
if that didn’t work—
Bingo.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.717
Thanks for waiting there,
Mr. Warren.

15:37.813 --> 15:40.225
This here is Dr. Sweets.
He’s going to be joining us.

15:40.357 --> 15:43.349
Dr. Sweets.
Please,
have a seat.

15:43.485 --> 15:47.103
I sure am sorry
to hear about Rachel.
Yeah.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.483
She was a sweet thing.

15:49.574 --> 15:53.613
Little loony with all
the New Age stuff,
but sweet.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.782
You and Rachel
were business competitors?
Nothing wrong with that.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.989
Competition is what makes
this country great.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.700
According to this suit
you filed,

16:01.837 --> 16:05.671
Rachel reneged on a promise
to go into business together?
Yes, she did.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.043
She had the land that was
licensed for green burials,

16:08.135 --> 16:10.046
and l have a strong brand.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.002
lthought
we’d do well together.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.131
Even though she was a loony?
The boomers are dying,
you know?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.637
There’s a fortune to be made
on all these bozos...

16:17.727 --> 16:19.854
driving around
in their electric cars,

16:19.938 --> 16:22.179
wanting to know the names
of the chickens they’re eating.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.889
You do understand
her backing out...

16:23.984 --> 16:25.599
gives you a strong motive
to kill her.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.776
Yeah, I wanted
to wipe her out.

16:27.863 --> 16:31.321
In court.
We had a deal.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.114
She takes up
with this Mirza,

16:33.201 --> 16:34.782
and she reneges
on the whole thing.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.993
When you say “takes up with”?
[ Scoffs ]

16:37.080 --> 16:40.618
What do you think?
They started
sleeping together.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.040
I guess he gave her
what she wanted,

16:42.127 --> 16:43.992
and she gave him
what I wanted.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.625
Oh, wait a minute.
[ Chuckles ]

16:47.716 --> 16:50.048
You guys didn’t know
that they were an item,
did you?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.420
Well,

16:51.511 --> 16:55.754
I wonder why Mr. Mirza
would hide something like that.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.360
HeHo,Lance.
Don’t hover.
You can come in.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.658
Oh. I wasn’t—
I wasn’t hovering.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.235
ljust— I didn’t
want to interrupt you...

17:18.330 --> 17:20.195
if you were in
the middle of something.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.405
Too late.
How can I help you?

17:21.499 --> 17:24.957
Uh, l—
Well, you know,

17:25.045 --> 17:26.785
H was in the lab.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.916
We haven’t seen
each other since—

17:29.007 --> 17:31.919
Since, you know—
Since we last saw
each other, and—

17:32.052 --> 17:34.964
How are you?
Good. I’m good.
How you doing?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.512
l’m reexamining
Rachel Knox’s X—rays,

17:37.599 --> 17:39.214
hoping to find leads
toward a murder weapon.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.592
Actually, I meant—
In doing so,
I realized the fracture...

17:41.686 --> 17:43.517
to the right side
of her nasal bone is remodeled.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.937
And that means that about
six months before her death,

17:46.024 --> 17:47.980
Rachel Knox sustained
a blow to the face.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.150
Cool.
Actually, when | asked
how you were doing,

17:50.237 --> 17:54.401
I meant you personally,
not you in the case.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.402
I don’t think
there’s any real need
for that conversation.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.404
Sure, there is.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.406
We were part
of each other’s lives
for a long time.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.829
What are we?
Supposed to just stop?

18:02.958 --> 18:06.075
I don’t know. This is
my first serious breakup.
Yeah, me too.

18:06.169 --> 18:09.252
But I don’t think
we—we have to stop
talking to each other.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.875
I mean, I don’t know.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.331
Have you found
a place to live yet?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.961
I’m staying
in the apartment
you found for us.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.005
Nice.
It’s working out
very well.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.929
I hear you’re still living
with Dr. Brennan
and Agent Booth.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.348
Mmm. Little bit,
temporarily.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.097
Also, I’m writing a paper
on asymmetrical bilateral
fracturing...

18:25.188 --> 18:27.520
of pubic tubercles in
late surgical separation...

18:27.607 --> 18:29.848
of postmedieval
conjoined twins
in Sighisoara, Romania.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.979
Wow. Nice.
Well done.

18:32.070 --> 18:36.109
l, uh— Hey, I had a paper
on body symmetry
and cognition...

18:36.199 --> 18:38.485
published in the Annual Review
of Psychology, so—

18:38.618 --> 18:41.530
I know. Congratulations.
How did you know?

18:41.621 --> 18:44.704
You credited me,
which was very nice.

18:44.791 --> 18:49.410
Everything I learned
about body symmetry,
I learned... from you.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.210
Very generous of you,
Lance.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.254
Now, I must get these
details to Dr. Brennan.

18:53.341 --> 18:57.004
— It was good seeing you.
- Yeah, it’s nice to—

18:57.095 --> 18:58.881
nice to be working
with you again.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.594
I didn’t tell you
about me and Rachel...

19:03.685 --> 19:05.801
becauseits—
it’s practically
ancient history.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.353
I doubt that.
Ancient history began
over 5,000 years ago,

19:09.441 --> 19:11.397
stops at the beginning
of the Middle Ages.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.985
Rachel and I broke up
nearly a year ago.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.570
It doesn’t mean
anything anymore,

19:14.654 --> 19:16.485
and it has nothing to do
with what happened to her.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.279
The thing is,
you don’t get
to decide any of that.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.982
[ Brennan ]
By “nearly a year ago,”
do you mean seven months?

19:21.077 --> 19:22.533
Yeah, yeah, seven months
sounds about right.

19:22.620 --> 19:26.738
That’s around the time
someone smashed her
in the face.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.873
I would never do that.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.918
Not on purpose.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.089
Right, so you ace/denla/ly
smashed her in the face.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.760
This is embarrassing.
Embarrassing?

19:40.847 --> 19:44.180
I’m thinking more
“incriminating,”
so spit it out.

19:44.267 --> 19:49.136
- Rachel is—
was a tantric master.
- Tantric sex?

19:49.230 --> 19:50.811
Bones, there’s got to be
other kinds of—

19:50.899 --> 19:52.810
— Yes, tantric sex.
— Okay, carry on.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.893
During one of
our... sessions, I fell.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.102
I got tired, I slipped,

19:57.197 --> 19:59.904
l was shifting my position,
and my elbow hit her.

20:00.033 --> 20:03.617
It’s the stupidest
thing I’ve ever heard.
It’s understandable.

20:03.703 --> 20:08.367
A successful tantric session
lasts seven, eight hours
and can cause extreme,

20:08.458 --> 20:10.699
sometimes painful,
muscle fatigue.

20:10.794 --> 20:13.376
Or she wanted out, he didn’t,
then something snapped.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.045
- No, I knew Rachel’s policy
up front.
— What kind of policy?

20:16.174 --> 20:19.837
Rachel had a three—month maximum
with a guy,
and then she moved on.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.510
She wanted fabulous sex,
spiritual connection,

20:22.597 --> 20:24.053
no strings.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.471
So you were only with her
for three months?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.640
Best three months
of my life.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.137
Then what? You went back
to business as usual?

20:29.270 --> 20:31.727
That was the arrangement.
It’s often
quite difficult...

20:31.815 --> 20:33.680
for a man to accord
to a woman’s rules,

20:33.775 --> 20:36.642
especially when rather
exquisite sex is involved.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.317
Look, I had my time
with Rachel.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.986
We were something,
then she moved on,

20:40.073 --> 20:42.155
and we went back
to being what
we always were—

20:42.242 --> 20:45.154
good friends
and business partners.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.737
Death business.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.914
Look, do you mind?
I have to get back to work.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.161
Losing Rachel has
left me shorthanded.

20:58.842 --> 21:02.175
[ Daisy ]
Dr. Saroyan.
I’ve made a startling discovery.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.425
— Let’s hear it.
- Monica Craig died of
lung cancer, correct?

21:05.515 --> 21:07.756
Yes. It metastasized
to her brain...

21:07.851 --> 21:09.557
and to her spine,
amongst other areas.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.805
May I commandeer
your computer?

21:19.487 --> 21:22.354
This shows bone metastasis
in the femur.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.656
Why don’t we justjump
to the startling discovery?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.278
I don’t think
Monica Craig’s cancer...

21:26.369 --> 21:28.234
was advanced enough
to cause actual death.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.865
What?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.242
I believe she had
weeks left to live
at the time of her death.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.117
Perhaps even months.
That is a startling discovery.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.463
We have no apparent
cause of death
for Monica Craig.

21:37.547 --> 21:40.129
Because we blamed it
on the cancer.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.044
Good job, Ms. Wick.
I know.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.673
So, using the info
that Daisy gave us,

21:46.764 --> 21:49.927
Hodgins and l have been
working together to try
to narrow down the weapon...

21:50.018 --> 21:51.929
that was used to create
the kill—shot wound.

21:53.688 --> 21:56.475
So I took a 3—D impression
of the wound to the sternum...

21:56.566 --> 21:58.807
to create an image,
which gives us—

22:00.320 --> 22:01.856
That’s a very
distinctive pattern.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.107
Scrapings contained
particulates of amazonite.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.110
It’s a stone indigenous
to this area.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.692
I checked the database to see
if there were any stone weapons...

22:08.786 --> 22:11.277
that could create
a similar wound pattern.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.035
[ Brennan ]
All ancient weapons.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.911
[ Hodgins ]
Yes, but do not despair,

22:16.002 --> 22:20.166
because the stone contained
microscopic particles
of diamonds, which means—

22:20.256 --> 22:22.542
— Saws.
— Yeah,
I also found cutting oil.

22:22.634 --> 22:27.003
So, the weapon was a cut rock,
sourced locally.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.428
A stone,
a—a burial marker.

22:29.516 --> 22:33.885
And Mirza makes all
of the burial markers for
Green Passages. Well done.

22:33.978 --> 22:37.937
Now we know
the victim was crushed
by a stone burial marker.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.481
And we know who made it.
[ Exhales ]

22:49.035 --> 22:51.242
[ Booth ] You know,
everything just keeps
coming back to you.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.363
You forget to mention something.
We find out about it.
We dig a little bit more,

22:54.457 --> 22:56.118
and then, hey, boom,
there’s something else.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.746
I lost my partner,
Agent Booth.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.337
I’m sorry
if my thoughts are muddled.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.288
Memory loss from grief
is quite common.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.418
And convenient.

23:04.509 --> 23:07.922
In your catalog, it says
that you hand—carve...

23:08.012 --> 23:10.003
all of the grave markers
for your clients.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.588
Yes. That is part
of our service.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.431
lncluding Mrs. Craig’s?
Yes. That was
a beautiful marker.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.976
— l carved the symbol chi.
- The Chinese symbol
for life—force.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.555
It meant a lot to her.
It was carved
from a local stone slab.

23:20.650 --> 23:23.107
I can give you
its dimensions
and its weight.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.775
I don’t want to leave
anything out this time.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.771
Grief really makes you
a smart—ass too.
No. No, no, no.

23:27.865 --> 23:31.278
That comes
from being repeatedly accused
of a crime I did not commit.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.912
We may not have
been intimate anymore,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.490
but I loved Rachel.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.075
Oh, I believe you loved her.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.160
But she ended the affair,
which made you really angry.

23:42.297 --> 23:46.290
[ Brennan ]
You should know that the marker
you placed on the grave...

23:46.426 --> 23:49.008
is headed for the lab
at the Jeffersonian.
What?

23:49.095 --> 23:52.553
Wait. You think someone used
the marker to kill Rachel?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.256
When a killer bludgeons someone
that violently,

23:55.351 --> 23:57.558
he usually leaves
behind some D.N.A.

23:57.645 --> 24:01.012
Oh, okay, so I can
expect you guys again
asking for a DNA. sample.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.098
Oh, but that
shouldn’t matter to you,
’cause you’re innocent, right?

24:03.192 --> 24:04.443
Yeah, that is right,
actually, but you know what?

24:04.527 --> 24:07.815
Just to be on the safe side,
I’m gonna consult an attorney.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.999
Dr. Hodgins,
everything all right?

24:22.086 --> 24:23.951
You’re not mad
at your beetles, are you?

24:24.047 --> 24:25.753
No. Maybe a little disappointed.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.831
But, no, l was just thinking
about what Daisy said—

24:27.925 --> 24:30.132
that Monica Craig’s cancer
wouldn’t have killed her yet.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.382
Cancer metastasizes differently
in every person.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.839
We’ll be running
more tests though.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.925
I want to be
shot into the sun.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.806
— Uh, what?
— When I die.

24:40.897 --> 24:44.105
I want to be loaded
into a spacecraft
and shot into the sun.

24:44.192 --> 24:45.432
Return to the source.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.142
You’re not expecting me
to arrange that
though,yeah?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.319
- No, I got it covered.
Thank you.
- Okay.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.146
How about you?
How do you want to go out?

24:52.241 --> 24:54.698
I am not
going in the ground,
that’s for damn sure.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.528
Ooh. I’ve hit a chord.
Why is that?

24:57.622 --> 25:00.910
Eleanor Marks,
New York, May 1994.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.616
— Is that one of your cases?
- It wasn’t my fault,
thank goodness.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.326
She was pronounced dead
by a colleague.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.037
But when the pallbearers
were carrying her coffin
to her grave,

25:08.132 --> 25:09.747
they heard scratching.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.709
— She was alive?
- It turns out,
she’d been in a coma,

25:12.804 --> 25:14.795
which is why I’m going
cremation all the way.

25:14.889 --> 25:17.551
| get it. Although you might
want to think about the sun.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.843
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.137
At what
specifically?

25:24.232 --> 25:26.393
Here.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.143
Look at this.
They’re different sizes.

25:30.238 --> 25:31.728
See these guys?

25:31.823 --> 25:34.155
They’re growing
at a rate that’s considered
normal for beetles, right?

25:34.242 --> 25:37.609
— But the others—
- Oh, their gross, wormy
bellies are swollen.

25:37.704 --> 25:41.162
Exactly. They’re obese,
which is entomologically
impossible.

25:41.249 --> 25:44.662
See, beetles have protein
receptors that prevent them
from overeating,

25:44.752 --> 25:46.208
but something
interfered with that.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.956
They might be able
to tell us how she died.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.958
— Hey, do you know
where the coffee grinder is?
— Why is that?

25:50.049 --> 25:53.132
Well, the blender’s broken.
I’m gonna have to grind up
these little blimps,

25:53.219 --> 25:55.255
find out what gave ’em
an eating disorder.

25:55.346 --> 25:58.509
You’ll be replacing the coffee
grinder with a new one, yes?

26:01.144 --> 26:02.759
[ Booth ]
You know what?
I don’t like this guy Akshay.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.183
ljust don’t like him.
I think we should bring in
Dr. Craig and talk to him again.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.936
When his wife was dying,
he dealt with
both Akshay Mirza...

26:09.026 --> 26:10.857
and Rachel
before she was murdered.

26:10.945 --> 26:13.402
Okay, so you’re thinking
that he may have noticed
some friction between them?

26:13.489 --> 26:15.229
Oh, definitely. You know,
small things he saw...

26:15.324 --> 26:17.485
that might appear
to be meaningless
could have great meaning.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.068
All right, tell you what.
I will give him a call.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.695
Booth, l have a question.
You know what?
Am I gonna regret this?

26:22.832 --> 26:24.493
Well,
when I saw Daisy today—
No! No, no.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.240
No.
You didn’t let me finish.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.996
I don’t have to.
The answer is no.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.419
It’s not about us
getting back together, okay?
It’s about me.

26:30.506 --> 26:35.045
No. Whatever you’re thinking
right now, just— just
get it out of your mind.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.218
If you’ll just
hear—hear me out.
I realized—

26:37.305 --> 26:39.967
No. Make no decisions
based on seeing Daisy,
understand? No.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.680
Getting an apartment?
No!

26:41.768 --> 26:43.178
’Cause you’d
get the wrong place
for the wrong reasons.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.305
— If you’d just let me talk!
- No, I’m not gonna let you talk.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.978
Just get it out of your mind.
You understand?
You need two weeks,

26:48.065 --> 26:50.226
and one good night
of getting drunk.

26:50.318 --> 26:53.151
All right? Look,
that’s what you need,
so you can think straight.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.019
But—
These are scientific facts.
No. The answer is no.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.442
But—
This conversation is over.
I’m gonna call the husband.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.273
Bye—bye.
No. Out of your mind.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.785
— [ Daisy Chuckles]
— So, I hope it wasn’t
too weird before at the lab.

27:06.876 --> 27:10.209
Not at all.
It was actually really
nice to see you again.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.379
And I’m glad we’re
mature enough to have
a cup of coffee together.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.885
So, I’ve missed you.
I’ve missed you.

27:19.972 --> 27:23.464
Um, you know,
’cause you were such
a big part of my life.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.550
Me too.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.233
The other night, I woke up
in the middle of the night.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.523
3:20?

27:32.610 --> 27:35.067
Of course. When else?

27:36.489 --> 27:38.980
And I... reached
out to touch you.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.111
But I wasn’t there.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.911
But I don’t want you to think
I’ve been alone this whole time.

27:45.039 --> 27:49.453
So, you’re seeing someone?
A pathologist, on and off.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.455
He also does stand—up
on the weekends.

27:51.546 --> 27:54.583
That’s nice. Sounds nice.

27:54.674 --> 27:58.337
l, um, I’ve been—
I’ve been sort of seeing
someone too.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.590
Uh, from the Bureau.
lt’s, uh, nothing serious.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.722
I’m glad for you.
I’ll bet she’s great.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.096
[ Chuckles ]

28:11.107 --> 28:13.439
I want to say something.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.940
Since we split,
I’ve been thinking.

28:22.618 --> 28:26.736
And... I wanted
to see you again
because I wanted to see—

28:26.831 --> 28:28.367
See if it was a mistake?

28:28.457 --> 28:30.163
Yes.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.580
Me too.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.582
I mean, we had so much.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.923
But it was a mistake.
We don’t belong together.

28:44.724 --> 28:45.964
I know.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.512
Now we don’t have
to question that anymore.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.806
[Cell Phone Chirps]

28:56.652 --> 28:59.029
Sorry.
[Beeps]

28:59.113 --> 29:00.899
I got to go.
l have an interrogation.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.275
Oh, no problem.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.526
But this was good, right?

29:03.618 --> 29:06.826
This was good, Lance.
Thanks.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.666
— So I’ll see you.
— See you.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.547
[Craig ] I heard
that Rachel and Akshay
had been involved,

29:23.638 --> 29:26.550
but it didn’t seem to me
like they were that close.

29:26.641 --> 29:28.097
They were never physical
around you?

29:28.184 --> 29:30.766
Sometimes, I guess.

29:30.853 --> 29:32.514
They were just
different.

29:32.605 --> 29:36.598
Akshay tried to
seem spiritual
like Rachel,

29:36.692 --> 29:38.398
but I never
really believed it.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.351
That’s probably one
of the reasons you’re suing him.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.232
Definitely.

29:42.365 --> 29:45.027
Rachel wasn’t like that?
Oh, God, no.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.951
No, Rachel was with us
in the early stages
of Monica’s cancer,

29:49.038 --> 29:52.201
talking to her
and arranging
her funeral wishes,

29:52.291 --> 29:54.782
choreographing
the memorial service.

29:54.877 --> 29:58.040
Akshayjust seemed like
he wanted to rush things along,

29:58.130 --> 30:00.507
move on to the next client.

30:00.591 --> 30:04.800
I hope they weren’t a couple,
because Rachel deserved
a lot more than Akshay.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.752
[Sighs]

30:07.556 --> 30:09.057
My beetles are bingers.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.642
I don’t know
what that means.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.808
Like Dr. Brennan,
I need clarity.

30:12.895 --> 30:16.638
Right. Pretty much the only
thing that can disturb
a beetle’s feeding pattern...

30:16.732 --> 30:18.814
and make them chunky
is something toxic.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.313
But I thought the tox screens
on the flesh samples
of both victims...

30:21.404 --> 30:22.814
came back negative
for any drugs.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.237
Because the beetles
were all the same size
when I collected them,

30:25.324 --> 30:27.155
but being ground up together,
it hid the results.

30:27.243 --> 30:30.827
Oh, so this time you only
used the fat beetles to
run through the GO mass spec.

30:30.913 --> 30:34.155
Exactly, and in the beetles
that were on Monica Craig,

30:34.250 --> 30:36.411
I discovered the presence
of methylone.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.663
Bath salts.
That’s a recreational drug.

30:38.754 --> 30:42.667
Particularly nasty.
Last year, the DEA. issued
an emergency ban on it.

30:42.758 --> 30:46.592
I can’t imagine a cancer patient
in her condition
using recreational drugs.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.670
Are you thinking
she was poisoned?

30:48.764 --> 30:51.927
If she overdosed on methylone,
that would explain
why Mrs. Craig died...

30:52.018 --> 30:54.430
before her cancer reached
its most advanced stage.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.636
Methylone doesn’t
just present in tissue.

30:56.731 --> 30:58.892
It would also be
evident in bone marrow.

30:58.983 --> 31:01.520
If I take samples,
and | find
excessive levels, then—

31:01.610 --> 31:03.225

His grief is very real.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.075
The guilt he feels is
attached to the fact...

to kill herself.
