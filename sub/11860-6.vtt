WEBVTT

00:13.166 --> 00:15.583
(male #1)
'Oh, God, grant us such
health'

00:15.667 --> 00:18.000
'of mind and body'

00:18.083 --> 00:20.583
'that those evils
that we suffer for our sins'

00:20.667 --> 00:22.750
'we may overcome'

00:22.834 --> 00:25.375
'through thine assistance.'

00:25.458 --> 00:27.625
Let us pray.

00:27.709 --> 00:28.917
Glory be to the Father

00:29.000 --> 00:31.417
and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.625
As it was in the beginning,
it is now, and ever

00:33.709 --> 00:36.041
'shall be, world without end.'

00:36.125 --> 00:37.417
Amen.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.041
<i>mi hijo?</i>

00:54.125 --> 00:56.291
That is why
we do what we do.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.291
I already walked
the track, Poppa.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.875
'Just be careful around
that clubhouse turn.'

00:59.959 --> 01:02.542
They should fire that
new tractor guy, huh?

01:02.625 --> 01:04.500
Turn is rockier
than my second marriage.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.959
Just keep him tight
on the inside, Poppa

01:09.041 --> 01:11.125
and then give him
his head and let him
run.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.458
You worry too much, Jose.

01:13.542 --> 01:14.959
(male announcer)
'The 37th annual running'

01:15.041 --> 01:17.959
'of the William Penn
Million Dollar Derby.'

01:18.041 --> 01:19.792
<i>mi hijo..</i>

01:19.875 --> 01:22.750
...then I go home to Mexico.

01:41.917 --> 01:45.041
I'll have your saw.
You give me a call.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.834
Construction crew
doing renovations

01:46.917 --> 01:48.333
at the Franklin
racetrack here

01:48.417 --> 01:49.959
dug up this
old
horse grave.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.458
Well, right here,
outside the track?

01:52.542 --> 01:54.333
Horse breaks
its leg in a race

01:54.417 --> 01:55.875
weight's too much
for it to heal right.

01:55.959 --> 01:58.166
They euthanized 'em
for humanitarian
reasons.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.875
- Hmm.
- Lot of dead horses.

01:59.959 --> 02:02.417
Standard procedure
back in the day.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.333
Nothing standard
about these
remains.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.542
M.E. says it's
small
for a femur.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.000
Adult male,
maybe
five-two.

02:09.083 --> 02:12.417
Decomposed silks,
riding pants, leather boots.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.709
They shoot
jockeys back then, too?

02:16.291 --> 02:17.959
Hmm, it's a money clip

02:18.041 --> 02:20.250
initialed "S.S."

02:22.125 --> 02:24.041
- Maybe a hundred bucks.
- ID?

02:24.125 --> 02:26.709
Nah, just a couple of old
business cards.

02:26.792 --> 02:29.750
(Rush)
'Uh, track comp cards
for guests and family.'

02:31.500 --> 02:35.041
Hmm. Ten
digits.
It's pretty
faded.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.667
Could be a bank account,
phone number.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.917
Racing silks, boots..

02:43.000 --> 02:44.959
...all decked out
and rarin' to go.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.709
Well, someone didn't
want this jockey

02:46.792 --> 02:48.542
to make it to the finish line.

03:23.917 --> 03:25.458
The money clip belongs
to a jockey

03:25.542 --> 03:26.834
named Sonny Sandoval.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.458
ME's checking dental
to confirm ID

03:28.542 --> 03:32.291
said the guy had over
30 healed bone fractures.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.667
Hmm, except these.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.792
Multiple puncture wounds
at the back of the skull.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.125
Got CSU looking into it.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.583
Well, the son, Jose, tried
to file a missing persons
report

03:42.667 --> 03:44.917
back in '86
that didn't fit the criteria.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.792
He was a legal adult,
no sign of foul play

03:46.875 --> 03:48.291
no indication he was in danger.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.208
Last seen Labor Day,
right after he lost

03:50.291 --> 03:51.959
the William Penn Derby Cup.

03:52.041 --> 03:55.542
Sandoval had lifetime earnings
over three million dollars.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.583
yet his house was about
to be foreclosed on.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.625
- Hmm, bank account statements?
- Still digging.

03:59.709 --> 04:02.500
His bank got bought
out twice since '86.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.625
Last one went belly up,
taken over by the Feds.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.542
Well, Jose states
that his father might've

04:06.625 --> 04:08.417
taken a flyer
here and there.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.083
Around all that action

04:10.166 --> 04:11.917
sooner or later
you're gonna shake the
baby.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.959
Gambling problem,
multiple
ex-wives--

04:14.041 --> 04:15.667
Gee, I wonder
where the money went.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.583
Yeah, could've been
in deep to somebody.

04:17.667 --> 04:20.250
- Made sure he paid up.
- Dug his own grave.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.083
You know for a guy
who liked to shoot the
works

04:22.166 --> 04:25.458
Sandoval's record's clean,
not even a parking ticket.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.959
Yeah, no official record.

04:28.041 --> 04:30.500
"Mil Hombres"

04:30.583 --> 04:32.500
<i>Mil Hombres</i>

04:32.583 --> 04:34.333
"Strength of a thousand men?"

04:34.417 --> 04:36.417
Uh, he needed it,
keep up with the
ladies

04:36.500 --> 04:37.750
he was pulling down.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.417
Sonny was a rock star.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.166
Women, money, cars..

04:41.250 --> 04:42.542
He got mixed up in any trouble

04:42.625 --> 04:44.125
PPD gave him a pass just like

04:44.208 --> 04:45.792
Iverson and Barkley.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.291
Come on. Jockeys?

04:48.375 --> 04:50.250
Those knee knockers
get the ladies?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.250
Hmm, still
a man on a horse.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.166
Confident, athlete..

04:55.125 --> 04:56.834
...winning combo.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.166
I'm saying this
town
loves a winner.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.834
Somebody shoot me.

05:00.917 --> 05:03.750
I'll beat the bushes with the
local bookies and loan sharks.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.667
See what falls out.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.375
You know says here
it took Jose 30
days

05:08.458 --> 05:10.041
to report his father missing.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.959
He's still a trainer there.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.375
Let's hit the track.

05:30.875 --> 05:34.208
You know at first I thought
he went back to Mexico.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.458
When I couldn't find him, I knew

05:35.542 --> 05:37.709
something bad
had happened to him.

05:37.792 --> 05:39.291
Just didn't think
it happened here.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.375
You know anything about
that grave, Jose?

05:41.458 --> 05:43.834
No, just there
was a barn back there

05:43.917 --> 05:45.417
for the old horses,
but Poppa always

05:45.500 --> 05:47.875
got the ones on the way up,
not the ones on the way out.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.500
When's the last time
you saw your old man?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.917
When he lost the William
Penn Derby in '86.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.750
I mean, it really tore him up.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.125
You two close?

05:55.208 --> 05:56.750
Poppa was my hero.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.917
I wanted to be
a jockey just like him

05:59.000 --> 06:01.417
but I hit a growth spurt
when I was 14.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.625
Only kid
in America upset about it.

06:03.709 --> 06:05.667
So close, yet it took
you nearly a month

06:05.750 --> 06:06.917
to file a police report.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.083
Look, it wasn't uncommon
for Poppa to take off

06:09.166 --> 06:10.583
after a tough loss.

06:10.667 --> 06:13.875
He was always talking
about going back to Mexico.

06:13.959 --> 06:16.333
Figured he just put himself
out to pasture.

06:16.417 --> 06:20.125
Understand Sonny liked
the ponies on and off the
track.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.583
It's not worth rehashing.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.542
Let's just say he liked
a lot of things

06:25.625 --> 06:26.834
that weren't good for him.

06:26.917 --> 06:29.625
<i>Mil Hombres con Mil Vicios.</i>

06:29.709 --> 06:32.250
<i>no hablo Espanol.</i>

06:32.333 --> 06:33.667
Born and raised in Philly.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.417
Me, too.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.083
Your dad in big to anyone?

06:37.166 --> 06:38.583
I-I wouldn't know.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.417
Poppa kinda told me things
on a need to know basis.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.834
Anyone else have
a beef with your old
man?

06:43.917 --> 06:45.750
Oh, Poppa usually carried
the beef.

06:45.834 --> 06:46.959
You know, he had
a big heart

06:47.041 --> 06:48.542
but people liked
to take advantage.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.542
People like who?

06:50.625 --> 06:52.125
Poppa's bug boy.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.125
I mean, I told
the cops back in the day

06:54.208 --> 06:56.709
gave that guy everything,
did nothing but betray him.

06:56.792 --> 06:57.917
Bug boy?

06:58.041 --> 07:00.834
He's a jockey's
apprentice
to your dad?

07:00.917 --> 07:04.500
Angelo Rivera, turned out
to be a worthless ingrate.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.417
- Had to have the guy
arrested.
- Yeah, for what?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.166
I mean, he stole Poppa's money
and jewelry

07:09.250 --> 07:11.250
to feed his drug habit.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.709
Guy was a fiend.

07:24.250 --> 07:27.000
<i>Que en paz descanse.</i>

07:27.083 --> 07:29.208
'Sonny was like
a father to me.'

07:29.291 --> 07:31.458
Cut from the same cloth..

07:31.542 --> 07:32.959
Two poor kids from Mexico.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.709
Well, sounds like
you learned a lot from
him.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.750
The man I am today...
is because of Sonny.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.709
That why you stole
from him, Angelo?

07:40.792 --> 07:42.875
They had you
arrested.
Pressed charges.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.583
<i>Esperate. Esperate.</i>
You got that wrong.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.375
(Rush)
'It wasn't your first time
to the dance.'

07:46.458 --> 07:48.250
You got popped twice
on meth charges.

07:48.333 --> 07:52.709
I broke my collarbone riding,
I started taking painkillers.

07:52.792 --> 07:55.583
I have that kinda brain, you
know, that can't shut it off.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.792
Before I knew it, I was
snorting
it, I was shooting it.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.500
- I just got lost.
- Well, I'll say.

08:00.583 --> 08:02.917
One more strike and you were
lookin' at some serious time.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.500
(Scotty)
'Yeah, but Sonny disappeared.
Case got thrown out.'

08:05.583 --> 08:08.792
Lucky for you,
he wound up in that
hole.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.959
(Lilly)
'You knew about that
horse grave?'

08:11.041 --> 08:13.000
I heard the rumors,
but I never saw it.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.166
Not drawing
a very convincing alibi,
Angelo.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.959
I was messed up, man.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.000
Bottomed out, baking donuts
in the Badlands.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.250
You trickin' for drugs?

08:24.333 --> 08:28.166
Look, the only person
I hurt was myself.

08:28.250 --> 08:31.834
After Sonny disappeared,
I got help.

08:31.917 --> 08:34.625
- Feeling guilty?
- No. Fed up.

08:34.709 --> 08:36.250
I got clean..

08:36.333 --> 08:39.208
...and dedicated my life
to helping these kids.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.375
These kids need somebody
to believe in them

08:43.458 --> 08:44.750
like Sonny believed in me.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.166
(male announcer)
'An unbelievable finish'

08:46.250 --> 08:48.083
'as the rookie
from Esteros, Mexico'

08:48.166 --> 08:50.583
'Angelo Rivera gets
his first win riding'

08:53.792 --> 08:55.250
"Can't" he said, huh?

08:55.333 --> 08:56.667
Born with it.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.166
This kid is the next
Mil Hombres.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.333
<i>- Te dije hijastro?</i>
- Si.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.625
Told him what, wanker?

09:05.709 --> 09:07.500
Box me in,
grab my horse's bridle?

09:07.583 --> 09:09.250
That's taking food
off
my family's table.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You
boxed yourself in, Ric,
okay?

09:11.792 --> 09:13.583
Don't blame the kid because
you tied one on last night.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.250
That was
Mil Hombres

09:15.333 --> 09:17.417
Even tugged his head.
You taught him that.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.834
Do what you got to do to win.
It's the name of the game.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.542
Maybe I'll take
your advice,
Sonny.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.709
Do what I gotta do.

09:34.625 --> 09:37.500
Ric Yanko, rival jockey.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.458
Always eating Sonny's dust.

09:40.834 --> 09:43.417
Should've put that shrimp
on the barbie.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.375
- Aussie still around?
- He owns a bar near the
track.

09:46.458 --> 09:48.291
- Still riding?
- 'Nah.'

09:48.375 --> 09:50.166
But he had his day.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.208
Ric never got a good horse
until Sonny disappeared.

09:53.291 --> 09:56.250
Then he became
the track's number one rider.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.959
Looked like
an S and M joint back there.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.834
All those whips and leather.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.583
Riding crops.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.000
Eh, same thing.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.083
Well, whip's meant
to inflict pain..

10:07.166 --> 10:09.834
Riding crop's to motivate.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.333
Uh, you're startin'
to scare me, Lil.

10:11.417 --> 10:14.166
You don't strike me
as the "National Velvet" type.

10:14.250 --> 10:17.667
Well, after my dad left,
uh, my mom needed a job.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.125
'She didn't notice
she was juiced. So..'

10:20.208 --> 10:22.709
She became a ticket taker.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.291
Your ma worked the track?

10:24.375 --> 10:27.542
Races were over I'd wait for
her
to count out her drawer.

10:27.625 --> 10:30.000
Sit in the
stands,
do my homework.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.375
It's probably not the best
place to leave a kid alone.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.917
Eh, not all bad.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.333
Got to know some of
the old-timers.

10:36.417 --> 10:38.041
The railbirds.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.375
They all had
one thing in
common..

10:39.458 --> 10:42.542
Pfft, yeah. Compulsive gambling.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.875
Dreamers.

10:43.959 --> 10:47.041
Always hoping,
tomorrow's better than
today.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.709
Ric Yanko?

11:03.417 --> 11:05.750
Depends who's asking, mate.

11:05.834 --> 11:06.875
Oh, yeah?

11:06.959 --> 11:08.250
Well drinks are on
the house, Johnnie.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.250
Food you pay for,
like everybody else.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.917
Detectives, mate.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.959
And we ain't here
for the cuisine.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.959
- Sonny Sandoval.
- Oh, yeah?

11:16.041 --> 11:18.750
That bloke finally show up off
his face in Mexico somewhere?

11:18.834 --> 11:21.041
Found Sonny's remains
in an old horse grave

11:21.125 --> 11:23.333
'at the back of the track.'

11:23.417 --> 11:24.709
No kidding.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.250
And that concerns me how?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.250
Career really took
off
once he was gone.

11:29.542 --> 11:31.500
I didn't need to kill
Sonny to beat him.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.583
The old git was
falling off all on his own.

11:33.667 --> 11:34.834
'Maybe you were in a hurry.'

11:34.917 --> 11:37.583
Or maybe you should
get your story straight.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.000
'Cause Sonny made me
a better rider.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.625
'No, like when the
rookie whipped you'

11:40.709 --> 11:43.208
and Sonny manhandled you
in front of the other
jockeys?

11:43.291 --> 11:44.583
Manhandled me?

11:44.667 --> 11:47.250
I've broken every bone
in my body twice, mate.

11:47.333 --> 11:50.208
You want a medal?

11:50.291 --> 11:54.458
Twelve hundred pound horse.
Shattered my pelvis in '92.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.959
If you've got
something to say, say it.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.625
I hope the horse was okay.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.291
Look here.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.291
There was a lot
of money on the table.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.750
People lost their cool.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.709
But all said and done,
we were still jockeys.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.834
And you wore
funny costumes. So what?

12:10.917 --> 12:14.000
[scoffs]
People have no idea
what we endure..

12:14.083 --> 12:15.375
Flipping to make weight.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.834
You know what it's like
to weigh 110 pounds?

12:17.917 --> 12:19.458
Not since fifth grade.

12:19.542 --> 12:22.834
It's a brotherhood. Jockeys.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.375
And there was no better friend
a jockey could have..

12:27.208 --> 12:30.041
...than Sonny Sandoval.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.250
Vamanos,

12:32.917 --> 12:34.333
So the doc tells me..

12:34.417 --> 12:36.291
...that he wants
to put a pin in my knee.

12:36.375 --> 12:37.375
What do you need that for?

12:37.458 --> 12:38.417
So I could keep kicking

12:38.500 --> 12:39.583
your dingo ass, Yanko.

12:41.709 --> 12:44.125
Broke my kneecap so many times.

12:44.208 --> 12:47.500
He thought I would
be crippled for life.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.250
<i>hell."</i>

12:50.709 --> 12:52.917
Won over a hundred
races since then

12:53.000 --> 12:55.959
and can still dance
<i>Jarabe Tapatio</i>

12:56.041 --> 12:58.834
with the best of 'em, huh?

13:05.417 --> 13:07.667
Hey, it's Baxter.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.500
'Hide your money.'

13:09.583 --> 13:12.417
Send that tab over to my table
if you will, partner.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.166
And just cut him off.
He's got to make weight

13:14.250 --> 13:16.083
and these beers
ain't helpin'
him.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.542
I'll take care
of the tab, Chris.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.583
And another round for everyone.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.583
You forget who owns you, Sonny?

13:22.667 --> 13:24.458
Don't have a problem
when I'm winning.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.375
But you're not.

13:26.458 --> 13:27.750
So I suggest you better..

13:27.834 --> 13:29.667
...turn it around
before you have a
problem

13:29.750 --> 13:31.792
that can't be fixed.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.041
Owners, jockeys..

13:40.125 --> 13:42.208
Love-hate relationship.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.000
You got to hand it
to old Sonny, though.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.375
That bloke had a pair.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.000
Why didn't Baxter
just fire Sonny

13:47.083 --> 13:48.875
for being such a thorn
in his side?

13:48.959 --> 13:50.208
Couldn't.

13:50.291 --> 13:53.834
Sonny had a three year
contract.
Paid him, win or lose.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.333
Sweet deal for Sonny.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.542
Especially since
he was in a slump.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.083
Baxter came back that night

13:59.166 --> 14:00.750
found Sonny at the bar.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.333
Told him he was worth
more dead to him than alive.

14:17.417 --> 14:19.041
Randall Baxter?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.041
I'm gearing up for
the Melbourne Cup there,
fellas.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.250
I ain't in no mood
for no interviews today.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.083
Well, get in the mood.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.250
You remember
Sonny Sandoval?

14:29.333 --> 14:32.041
Yeah, I heard about that.
That's a terrible thing.

14:32.125 --> 14:35.083
I understand you buried
a few of your horses back
there.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.750
Well, sometimes horses
have to be put down.

14:37.834 --> 14:38.959
How about jockeys?

14:39.041 --> 14:40.500
[chuckles]
Now, hold on here.

14:40.583 --> 14:43.041
Why would I want to get rid of
Sonny? He was one of my best.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.959
Well, way we hear it, he was
losing more than he was
winnin'.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.291
Guaranteed contract
was costing you major
moolah.

14:48.375 --> 14:51.166
Sonny was a champion, you know.
you can't teach that.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.208
Well, he still had
the ability to pull it out

14:53.291 --> 14:55.458
if he just had
his head on straight.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.000
Sayin' it wasn't?

14:57.083 --> 14:58.959
Well, he started
losing focus, you know?

14:59.041 --> 15:02.375
And his...his sense of
priorities were whacked out.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.500
- Why is that?
- Why else?

15:04.583 --> 15:06.959
He started listening to a woman.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.625
Should have never hired
that female trainer.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.792
Bad luck.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.041
- 'A couple of minutes ago.'
- Who told you?

15:14.125 --> 15:16.125
- 'One of the farmhands did.'
- 'Fine. Here, hold-hold it.'

15:19.917 --> 15:21.583
Why did you scratch
Firewalker, Baxter?

15:21.667 --> 15:23.834
'Cause Firewalker can't win.

15:23.917 --> 15:26.834
That horse would rather
die than lose.

15:26.917 --> 15:29.959
Well, then his legs ain't
as strong as his heart
anymore.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.500
First time he's been
healthy in a year.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.500
Tell you what.
He loses, you keep my money.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.750
No, I can't risk that,
Sonny.
It's too big a race.

15:36.834 --> 15:37.834
We had a plan.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.000
Well, the plan's changed.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.709
Firewalker's going out to stud.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.083
Hell, we should
all be so lucky.

15:42.166 --> 15:45.417
Either Firewalker races,
or I quit.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.125
You better check
your contract,
Hombre.

15:47.208 --> 15:50.333
'Cause you race for
me,
or you don't race at
all.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.834
'Now, you're on Sapphire,
so deal with it.'

15:52.917 --> 15:54.583
Sapphire's too young.

15:54.667 --> 15:55.667
You're racing her too much.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.709
You're taking her
along too fast.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.166
'She's gonna end up
with the same injuries'

15:59.250 --> 16:01.875
Firewalker got.

16:01.959 --> 16:05.709
When did you become
such an animal lover,
Sonny?

16:05.792 --> 16:06.792
Put that on the list of things

16:06.875 --> 16:09.542
you don't know
about me, Randall.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.792
You saddle up on Sapphire

16:11.875 --> 16:15.583
or you sit out the remaining two
years of your contract, unpaid.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.834
That was the...beginning
of the end.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.166
He lost his competitive edge.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.458
That old girl filled his head
with all kinds of ideas

16:28.542 --> 16:31.291
about how horses
should be eating organic hay

16:31.375 --> 16:33.917
and drinking
room temperature water.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.375
The horror.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.208
Lady Macbeth got a name?

16:37.291 --> 16:39.792
Yeah. Kristi, uh, Duren.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.083
She made him soft.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.917
It's the last thing
a jockey can be.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.542
Sounds like she wasn't
just grooming the horses.

16:46.625 --> 16:50.166
Yeah, the last I heard,
she moved in with him.

16:50.250 --> 16:53.166
I fired her ass a day too late..

16:53.250 --> 16:55.000
...if you ask me.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.750
Hey. Located a Kristi Duren.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.375
Trainer in Saratoga.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.375
She's in the city.
On her way down now.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.000
(Vera)
'Who sent the goods?
What have we got?'

17:10.083 --> 17:11.417
(Jeffries)
'You have a message'

17:11.500 --> 17:13.458
from the Pennsylvania
Treasury Department.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.667
And the boss wants to see you.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.500
What?

17:18.583 --> 17:20.625
Your mama didn't
teach you how to share?

17:25.166 --> 17:26.125
You rang?

17:26.208 --> 17:28.041
You get a hit on
that number yet?

17:28.125 --> 17:31.625
Sonny had a safe deposit box
at another bank branch.

17:31.709 --> 17:34.375
State escheated it
due to inactivity.

17:34.458 --> 17:35.959
It's been sitting up
in Harrisburg

17:36.041 --> 17:38.667
at the Pennsylvania Treasury
Department the last 20 years.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.458
Alright, get a subpoena,
send a uniform up there.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.875
'Uh, one other thing, Nick.'

17:45.959 --> 17:46.917
I just saw this.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.166
'Oh, yeah.'

17:48.250 --> 17:50.166
That joker Sadowsky
in Vice took this

17:50.250 --> 17:52.959
after I worked a double last
week. I was up all night.

17:53.041 --> 17:54.625
It got e-mailed
around the
department.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.458
Eh, guy's are
breaking my balls.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.333
It made its way up to
the Deputy Commissioner.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.208
He wants you to get a physical.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.250
A physical?

18:02.333 --> 18:04.083
What's that got to do
with me taking a few winks?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.709
Pencil pusher wants
to send a message.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.667
You opened the door.

18:09.667 --> 18:10.792
Just a bunch of bull.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.917
Just do it, Nick.

18:16.125 --> 18:20.250
Hard business for a woman
to break into back then.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.083
Sonny helped me get
my first training
job.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.667
He saw something in you.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.500
The man had a good soul.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.750
Loved horses.

18:27.834 --> 18:30.000
- Loved horse people.
- Like you?

18:30.083 --> 18:32.125
Stayed with him whenever
I wasn't on the road

18:32.208 --> 18:33.500
and needed a place to crash.

18:33.583 --> 18:37.041
Well, that come free,
or with benefits?

18:39.500 --> 18:40.709
What happened to Sonny?

18:40.792 --> 18:44.709
Found his remains
in an old...horse grave.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.458
Back of the track.

18:48.792 --> 18:51.625
- Horse pit.
- 'That what they called
it?'

18:51.709 --> 18:53.375
For the horses
they put down at the track?

18:53.458 --> 18:57.000
That, and the old horses that
got slaughtered for their
meat.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.542
Slaughtered? For meat?

18:58.625 --> 19:01.250
From stable to table,
in Japan within days.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.041
(Kristi)
'Racing's dirty little
secret.'

19:03.125 --> 19:04.875
Well, Sonny know
about that back then?

19:04.959 --> 19:06.250
'Suspected as much.'

19:06.333 --> 19:08.458
Horse is an investment.

19:08.542 --> 19:12.166
Some owners try to eke out
every last dollar.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.542
I just opened
Sonny's eyes to that reality.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.959
Baxter didn't appreciate it.

19:17.041 --> 19:18.500
I'm getting the feeling
that you and Sonny

19:18.583 --> 19:20.834
were more than just...bunkmates.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.041
Fell for the old guy.

19:24.125 --> 19:28.083
Taught me so much
about horses,
life.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.750
I knew he needed someone
to take care of him.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.083
(Rush)
'Cared so much
that you didn't even'

19:31.166 --> 19:34.959
come forward,
when he disappeared.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.583
Only 'cause Sonny
had already pushed me away.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.458
Where the hell is Jose?
I called him three times.

19:43.542 --> 19:45.041
Stop worrying.

19:45.125 --> 19:47.792
Relax.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.750
You should take that job
in Saratoga, Kristi.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.917
Can't. I'm training
you and Sapphire.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.917
'Ah, Sapphire's had trainers.'

19:55.000 --> 19:57.542
But you break that maiden
there with its bloodline

19:57.625 --> 19:59.083
you got a career.

19:59.166 --> 20:01.417
I want to be with you.

20:01.500 --> 20:05.458
Ten years ago, I'd give you
a run for your money.

20:05.542 --> 20:07.875
But this ride is
slowing down to a light
trot.

20:07.959 --> 20:09.750
You're the best jockey
I've ever seen, Sonny.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.667
Aah! What has it gotten me, hmm?

20:12.750 --> 20:14.166
'Doesn't matter how much money'

20:14.250 --> 20:15.834
how many races I win..

20:15.917 --> 20:18.583
I'm still just a monkey to
Baxter's organ grinder.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.333
That's not true.

20:20.417 --> 20:23.792
Then why am I not riding
Firewalker in my last race,
hm?

20:28.041 --> 20:32.959
Oh! 45 years old, and I can
barely climb out of the tub.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.041
Oh.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.125
Oh!

20:39.834 --> 20:41.166
Take the job, Kristi.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.709
(Jose)
'I'm here, Pop.'

20:42.792 --> 20:45.709
Don't look back.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.417
Next day, I was out
as Sapphire's trainer.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.667
Packed my stuff,
went to Saratoga.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.041
Been there ever since.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.542
What were Sonny
and-and Jose fighting about?

21:02.625 --> 21:04.041
They always spoke in
Spanish when they
didn't

21:04.125 --> 21:06.000
want me to
understand.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.875
- In Spanish?
- Had to guess.

21:07.959 --> 21:11.125
It was probably about
Jose's money problems.

21:11.208 --> 21:13.333
Oh, like father like son.

21:13.417 --> 21:15.291
The gambling problems
run in the family?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.417
No, just Jose.

21:18.417 --> 21:20.500
Sonny had a lot of vices.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.709
But gambling wasn't one of 'em.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.667
CSU says these puncture wounds

21:24.750 --> 21:28.500
at the back of Sonny's skull
are equally spaced.

21:28.583 --> 21:32.291
Likely caused by some
sharp instrument.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.709
Well, could be a rake.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.625
Pitchfork?

21:34.709 --> 21:36.041
'Something from the stables.'

21:36.125 --> 21:38.000
(Vera)
'Bunch of cashed checks
made out to Jose'

21:38.083 --> 21:39.291
from Sonny's bank account.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.625
Sonny didn't have
a gambling
problem.

21:41.709 --> 21:42.792
Jose did.

21:42.875 --> 21:44.166
So, why did he lie about that?

21:44.250 --> 21:46.458
Or speaking Spanish?

21:46.542 --> 21:48.709
And what else does
Jose got to hide?

22:00.709 --> 22:02.709
(Valens)
<i>'Perdon, que hora es?'</i>

22:02.792 --> 22:05.875
<i>Son veinte despues de las..</i>

22:05.959 --> 22:07.166
Hola,

22:07.250 --> 22:09.625
Sure sounded
like Spanish to me.

22:09.709 --> 22:12.625
(Valens)
'What, you ashamed
of being Mexican, boss?'

22:12.709 --> 22:15.417
My mother came to this
country
and cleaned people's homes.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.000
'Wanted me to assimilate.'

22:17.083 --> 22:18.083
Speak English.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.000
Still no reason
to lie about it.

22:20.083 --> 22:23.542
Every time I speak
Spanish,
it reminds me of Poppa.

22:23.625 --> 22:24.917
It hurts too much.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.166
Kinda like his
gambling problem.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.750
There's no need
to dredge that
up.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.625
(Rush)
'Oh, because it wasn't
his

22:29.709 --> 22:30.959
It was yours.

22:31.041 --> 22:33.792
Your pop got tired of
digging you out. Cut you off.

22:33.875 --> 22:35.500
It took you a month
to file a police report.

22:35.583 --> 22:37.291
Waiting for that trail
to go cold.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.917
No, it wasn't like that.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.250
What was it like, Jose?

22:40.333 --> 22:42.000
Starting to lose track
of all your lies.

22:42.083 --> 22:44.208
'Look, I had a problem, okay?'

22:44.291 --> 22:46.709
And I caused my pop
a lot of pain.

22:46.792 --> 22:48.458
But he made damn sure
I paid him back.

22:48.542 --> 22:50.750
- With what?
- 'My back.'

22:50.834 --> 22:53.667
He needed a new
trainer for
Sapphire.

22:53.750 --> 22:56.041
And I needed to prove myself.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.166
(Jose)
'Let's go, Sapphire.'

23:02.250 --> 23:03.375
Okay, cool her down.

23:03.458 --> 23:06.208
- She's a little washy.
- Anxious.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.542
That's because she's
been raced too much.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.792
She's probably getting
shin splints already.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.291
[sighs]
Listen,
poppa.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.500
I'm done this time, for real.

23:18.667 --> 23:21.041
- No short cuts, Jose.
- Uh-uh.

23:21.125 --> 23:23.750
Man has to have
a purpose, a calling.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.500
It's a gift to have
<i>un don con los caballos.</i>

23:26.583 --> 23:27.625
Special bond with the horses.

23:27.709 --> 23:29.291
Si,

23:31.208 --> 23:33.834
The horse knows
who to trust..

23:33.917 --> 23:34.959
'Who to fear..'

23:35.041 --> 23:36.417
'Who to lay it all down for.'

23:36.500 --> 23:38.709
Like Firewalker.

23:38.792 --> 23:43.083
- When I first uh, saw him
run..
- Mm-hmm?

23:43.166 --> 23:46.041
...this old, uh,
dust track in New Mexico

23:46.125 --> 23:48.041
just a two-year-old,
small for his age...

23:48.125 --> 23:51.166
not the fastest,
not the strongest horse.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.542
'38-1 odds.'

23:52.625 --> 23:53.792
'Won by three lengths.'

23:53.875 --> 23:55.542
- It's unbelievable.
- Mm-hmm.

23:55.625 --> 23:56.834
taken that horse from last

23:56.917 --> 23:59.000
to first, more times
than I can remember.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.000
(Jose)
'A scrapper.'

24:00.083 --> 24:01.125
(Sonny)
'Warrior.'

24:01.208 --> 24:03.083
Leaves it all on the track.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.709
Why isn't he racing
in the derby then?

24:04.792 --> 24:07.542
Ah, people don't care
about what you did.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.125
'They only care about
what you're doing.'

24:10.500 --> 24:12.041
You'll win with
Sapphire,
though, right?

24:12.125 --> 24:14.959
Sapphire hasn't lost
a race yet.

24:15.041 --> 24:17.709
If she loses, it's my fault.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.917
<i>Largate, sinverguenza!</i>

24:28.000 --> 24:31.291
<i>Largate! Andale!</i>
<i>Largate!</i>

24:31.375 --> 24:32.750
<i>No te metas en lo</i>
<i>que no te importa!</i>

24:32.834 --> 24:33.750
<i>Largate! Largate!</i>

24:33.834 --> 24:34.875
<i>Suelta la pala a ver que pasa!</i>

24:34.959 --> 24:36.125
Yeah, fine!

24:36.208 --> 24:38.709
<i>Vete! Ver a te!</i>

24:42.792 --> 24:46.542
It only took him 20 years to
tell me I was good at
something.

24:46.625 --> 24:49.250
It was like we
just
turned a
corner..

24:49.333 --> 24:50.667
...and then he was gone.

24:50.750 --> 24:54.041
So, who was the guy in
the truck, spooking the
horses?

24:54.125 --> 24:55.333
Juan Diaz.

24:55.417 --> 24:57.542
He worked out of the back barn.

24:57.625 --> 24:59.583
Seeing if we were
selling any old
horses.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.208
Sold off to market
for the meat?

25:01.291 --> 25:03.709
Yeah. People turned
a blind eye to what
happened

25:03.792 --> 25:05.250
to the old horses.

25:05.333 --> 25:07.583
Poppa said he
couldn't
do it anymore.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.083
He had Diaz banned
from the track.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.917
That back barn...is near
where the horse grave was?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.208
Until it burned down.

25:15.291 --> 25:17.208
Look, I don't know
if Diaz dug that
grave

25:17.291 --> 25:19.333
but he had to
know
it was there.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.375
We'll be in touch, Jose.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.291
Hot date?

25:28.375 --> 25:30.333
Uh, something
I gotta check on.

25:30.417 --> 25:33.458
I'll meet you back
at the roundhouse?

25:37.583 --> 25:38.625
<i>'Viejo?'</i>

25:38.709 --> 25:39.792
<i>'Nuevo.'</i>

25:39.875 --> 25:42.083
[laughing]
What's wrong?

25:42.166 --> 25:43.583
Shoes didn't fit?

25:43.667 --> 25:44.834
I don't think
I can return them.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.583
Ah, no, no.

25:46.667 --> 25:50.125
Look, ma tell you
she hurt her knee?

25:50.208 --> 25:53.000
- Maybe. You know your mother.
- She talks a lot.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.000
Some I hear,
some not so much.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.291
This have
anything
to do with her

25:57.375 --> 25:58.625
taking cash from
our bank account?

25:58.709 --> 26:00.792
Oh, just try to remember, Pop.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.792
Oh, uh, I was
watching
the Phillies game

26:03.875 --> 26:05.333
the one that ended
in the triple play.

26:05.417 --> 26:07.166
Kid on second
base,
unassisted--

26:07.250 --> 26:08.792
Uh, Bruntlett,
yeah, beat the Mets.

26:08.875 --> 26:09.917
What happened with Ma?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.250
She went to, uh,
Dayley's market
late

26:12.333 --> 26:15.458
to pick up some seafood
and rice to make me some
<i>paella.</i>

26:15.542 --> 26:16.875
She slipped and fell.

26:16.959 --> 26:18.667
- And that's it?
- Yeah, she came home..

26:18.750 --> 26:21.208
...took a shower
and went to bed.

26:21.291 --> 26:22.458
<i>paella?</i>

26:22.542 --> 26:23.959
She said she was tired.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.875
I had a frozen dinner instead.

26:26.959 --> 26:28.917
That's Dayley's
on 19th and Fairmount?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.792
No, the one on Spring Garden.

26:30.875 --> 26:34.166
Your mom says they have
better produce there.

26:34.250 --> 26:36.875
Everything okay?

26:36.959 --> 26:40.500
Yeah, yeah, Pop.
Everything's fine.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.166
Okay.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.875
<i>estas flaco.</i>
<i>- Si, si, si.</i>

26:49.333 --> 26:50.667
Banana bread.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.834
Put nuts in it this year.

26:52.917 --> 26:55.500
Never misses an anniversary.

26:55.583 --> 26:58.291
- The mother?
- Wanda Johnson.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.917
Left for school,
never came home.

27:02.625 --> 27:03.834
How long has it been?

27:03.917 --> 27:06.625
Sixteen years.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.417
Won't let go.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.792
You call her back yet?

27:09.875 --> 27:12.834
Just to break her heart
all over again.

27:12.917 --> 27:14.667
No new leads.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.208
'No sense to be made of it.'

27:19.417 --> 27:22.917
Uh, you get ready to make
the call, use my office.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.625
Yeah.

27:24.709 --> 27:27.208
How the hell did you
end up in Williamsport?

27:27.291 --> 27:28.875
Car's got GPS, Wayne.

27:28.959 --> 27:30.792
Well, turn on the lights
and lead-foot it to
Harrisburg

27:30.875 --> 27:32.208
before the Treasury
closes at 6:00.

27:32.291 --> 27:35.208
I need that box!

27:35.291 --> 27:37.041
Knucklehead's gotta
be
related to somebody.

27:37.125 --> 27:39.875
Uh, looks like the meat man
got his ticket punched.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.750
Juan Diaz, deported by INS.

27:42.834 --> 27:44.792
Yeah, impounded
his truck back in '99.

27:44.875 --> 27:46.709
And I found
a track parking pass..

27:46.792 --> 27:48.542
...butcher tools
and a stunbolt gun.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.125
Ah, put a horse down fast.

27:50.208 --> 27:53.083
- Or a jockey for good.
- We even know if he's alive?

27:53.166 --> 27:56.166
Just that Diaz got
deported to Esteros, Mexico.

27:56.250 --> 27:58.417
And Angelo Rivera
is from Esteros.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.750
And population, 2100.

28:00.834 --> 28:03.250
Sonny's bug boy comes from
the same small town as Diaz.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.834
Ends up working the same
place, 4000 miles away.

28:06.917 --> 28:08.583
Angelo worked for the meat man.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.834
Knew damn well
where that grave was.

28:12.417 --> 28:15.500
(Angelo)
'Okay, that was good.
That was very good.'

28:17.625 --> 28:19.583
Okay, you guys go
brush the horses.

28:19.667 --> 28:22.125
<i>Taco de caballo.</i>

28:22.208 --> 28:25.583
<i>carne asada</i>
from horse meat,
Angelo?

28:25.667 --> 28:28.291
Back in Esteros?

28:28.375 --> 28:30.125
That's some kind of sick joke?

28:30.208 --> 28:32.125
Sick alright, but no joke.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.125
- You working with Juan Diaz?
- Know a lot of Juan Diazes.

28:35.208 --> 28:37.208
Talking about the one from
your hometown, knucklehead.

28:37.291 --> 28:39.333
The meat man.

28:42.875 --> 28:46.125
Um, Diaz offered me
a way out of Esteros.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.583
I needed a job,
willing to do anything.

28:48.667 --> 28:50.750
Killing horses?

28:50.834 --> 28:53.792
I never killed a horse.
Just buried what was left.

28:53.875 --> 28:56.625
You know, it made me sick,
but it was part of the
business.

28:56.709 --> 28:59.959
That all you buried? Horses?

29:00.041 --> 29:01.875
Come on, guys.

29:01.959 --> 29:04.750
Look, all I ever wanted
to be was a jockey.

29:04.834 --> 29:06.291
I owe my career to Sonny.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.834
And your life to Juan Diaz.

29:07.917 --> 29:09.458
Sonny had him
banned from the
track.

29:09.542 --> 29:12.875
- Lost his livelihood.
- Guy who gave you your start.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.208
You dug that grave.

29:14.291 --> 29:16.166
Put Sonny's body
where it'd never be
found.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.959
No.

29:18.041 --> 29:20.125
Juan got me here.

29:20.208 --> 29:22.375
But Sonny gave me my dream.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.583
And I threw it all away.

29:39.917 --> 29:43.458
Heard about what happened
to Firewalker.

29:43.542 --> 29:46.208
Sorry.

29:46.291 --> 29:48.166
It was no accident.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.333
I'm not gonna let
Baxter
get away with it this
time.

29:50.417 --> 29:51.458
Be careful, Sonny.

29:51.542 --> 29:53.166
Don't want to see you
get blackballed.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.875
End of the line
<i>mi</i>
<i>amigo.</i>

29:55.959 --> 29:59.208
My last race, was
gonna
ride Firewalker out.

29:59.291 --> 30:02.083
Son of a bitch Baxter
has taken that away from
me.

30:02.166 --> 30:04.375
Firewalker deserved better.

30:04.458 --> 30:07.792
Killing horses for
money
has to end.

30:07.875 --> 30:10.792
We all get thrown away
when we can't win
anymore.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.709
Unless you keep winning.

30:12.792 --> 30:15.834
Slow down, kid.
You'll end up like
me.

30:15.917 --> 30:18.875
- One hell of a jockey?
- Broke, whizzing blood.

30:18.959 --> 30:21.125
Lucky to have
one kidney
working.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.208
A 110 pounds.

30:25.291 --> 30:29.208
Getting on a 1000 pound animal,
going 45 miles an hour.

30:29.291 --> 30:30.709
And you're not even straight.

30:30.792 --> 30:35.917
Like you always taught me,
do whatever I have to do to
win.

30:36.041 --> 30:37.917
I was wrong.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.500
I'm worried about you, Angelo.

30:39.583 --> 30:41.917
I'll be fine.
Never felt better.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.125
Is that why you
stole from me?

30:48.041 --> 30:50.125
I was gonna pay you back.

30:52.542 --> 30:55.417
You want to pay me back?

30:55.500 --> 30:57.583
Take care of yourself.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.291
Sonny was right.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.333
Horses, jockeys..

31:05.417 --> 31:07.417
...were all disposable.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.125
One day you're
on top of the heap

31:09.208 --> 31:12.750
and the next, done for good.

31:12.834 --> 31:15.166
Firewalker?
Sold off to Juan
Diaz?

31:15.250 --> 31:17.542
No, stable fire.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.208
But everybody knew it
was an insurance job.

31:20.291 --> 31:22.667
- How sick was Sonny?
- Pretty bad.

31:22.750 --> 31:25.959
But a macho guy like that
never went to a doctor.

31:26.041 --> 31:28.125
Now where was he getting
all the pain pills?

31:28.208 --> 31:30.875
Track vets will hook you up
for the right price.

31:30.959 --> 31:34.917
'But for him, it just
wasn't enough anymore.'

31:35.000 --> 31:38.208
Neither is your alibi,
Angelo.
Comin' in with us.

32:02.417 --> 32:05.834
I understand
your...champion horse

32:05.917 --> 32:11.375
Firewalker, died
in a stable fire in '86?

32:11.458 --> 32:14.291
Uh, casualty
of the
business.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.750
You know, we can put
a man on the moon

32:15.834 --> 32:18.333
but we still
make barns out of
wood.

32:18.417 --> 32:21.583
You were investigated
for insurance fraud in '94.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.500
Stallion named Bloodline.

32:23.583 --> 32:25.500
three

32:25.583 --> 32:28.500
'over a 13 year period
to barn fires.'

32:28.583 --> 32:30.333
- Hmm..
- That's a lot of accidents.

32:30.417 --> 32:33.083
Well, it happens
to the best of us,
partner.

32:33.166 --> 32:34.917
But I'm gonna tell
y'all
just like I told
them

32:35.000 --> 32:36.583
insurance investigators.

32:36.667 --> 32:39.041
Why in the hell would I
wanna kill a horse that I
paid

32:39.125 --> 32:40.542
nearly a million dollars for?

32:40.625 --> 32:43.250
That's exactly what we
were asking ourselves.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.834
Till we saw this.

32:46.917 --> 32:48.333
This insurance claim.

32:48.417 --> 32:50.166
Uh, you made two million dollars

32:50.250 --> 32:51.834
when Firewalker
went up in smoke.

32:51.917 --> 32:55.041
And another mil and
a half...from Bloodline.

32:55.125 --> 32:57.333
Well, that right
there
is just peanuts

32:57.417 --> 32:58.959
in comparison to..

32:59.041 --> 33:01.375
...what I spend
each year on stud
fee.

33:01.458 --> 33:03.917
Guess they outlive their use,
like Firewalker.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.709
(Valens)
'You really know
how to squeeze'

33:05.792 --> 33:08.250
a dollar out of a horse.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.041
Dead or alive.

33:10.125 --> 33:12.875
Well, I'm going to
take that as a
compliment.

33:12.959 --> 33:15.291
That is, unless y'all know
something those insurance

33:15.375 --> 33:16.625
'investigators don't.'

33:16.709 --> 33:20.375
Oh, we know Sonny was
going to rat you out

33:20.458 --> 33:21.917
after that big race.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.917
(Rush)
'Couldn't afford that
kind of attention.'

33:24.000 --> 33:26.083
Open up another arson
investigation.

33:26.166 --> 33:28.458
So, you put him in a hole.

33:30.083 --> 33:32.959
I didn't kill that old cuss.

33:33.041 --> 33:35.417
But I should've.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.250
Thank y'all for coming.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.500
- 'Here.'
- 'Good luck'

33:49.667 --> 33:52.667
This is why they call
this the Sport of
Kings.

33:52.750 --> 33:55.625
Listen at 'em. They can't
wait to see those beasts
run.

33:55.709 --> 33:57.583
It's going to be
a good one, sir.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.709
This goes well, you're going to
be training many of my ponies.

34:00.792 --> 34:02.291
Thank you, Mr. Baxter.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.375
(male announcer)
'And they're off and
running!'

34:05.458 --> 34:08.792
'The William Penn Million
Dollar Derby has begun.'

34:08.875 --> 34:10.917
'Right out of the gate
veteran jockey Sonny Sandoval'

34:11.000 --> 34:12.792
'fillin' the lane
with gusto riding Sapphire'

34:12.875 --> 34:15.000
'to the front of the pack.'

34:15.083 --> 34:16.542
Steady..

34:16.625 --> 34:18.500
'First turn,
Sapphire holds his lead.'

34:18.583 --> 34:20.125
'But Little Hope,
ridden by Angelo Rivera'

34:20.208 --> 34:21.542
'makes his move on the outside.'

34:21.625 --> 34:23.083
Come on, poppa!

34:23.166 --> 34:25.583
'They enter the back stretch
Sapphire by a head'

34:25.667 --> 34:29.583
'Little Hope
running a close second.'

34:29.667 --> 34:30.834
He's going to break her
out of the pack.

34:30.917 --> 34:33.208
No, not yet..

34:33.291 --> 34:34.917
'They turn for home,
Sapphire breaks open'

34:35.000 --> 34:37.917
'runnin' and gunnin' now, ahead
a length, a length and a half.'

34:38.000 --> 34:38.959
[laughing]
That's him!

34:39.041 --> 34:40.375
- Poppa!
- 'Go! Go!'

34:40.458 --> 34:43.041
'Letting out all stops
in the final stretch..'

34:47.000 --> 34:49.500
'Wait! Little Hope pulls
within a length of Sapphire.'

34:49.583 --> 34:51.083
What the hell's he doin'!

34:51.166 --> 34:52.208
'Little Hope suddenly
moves into the lead'

34:52.291 --> 34:54.625
'as Sapphire begins to fade.'

34:56.083 --> 34:58.041
'Little Hope is ahead
by a nose, a length.'

34:58.125 --> 35:00.166
'She's gonna pull
off the upset.'

35:00.250 --> 35:01.750
'Little Hope wins!'

35:07.917 --> 35:11.333
Son of a bitch!
He pulled up on him on purpose!

35:11.417 --> 35:12.291
Mr. Baxter--

35:12.375 --> 35:14.041
Shut up!
Get the hell outta
here.

35:14.125 --> 35:17.583
I'm gonna have that taco bender
and your whole family deported!

35:19.208 --> 35:21.250
(Baxter)
'You know, that was
the..'

35:21.333 --> 35:23.917
...first of three heart attacks.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.166
I spent a month in recovery
at Mercy Hospital.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.709
Sonny choked on purpose?

35:28.792 --> 35:30.250
Over a stupid horse.

35:30.333 --> 35:33.417
Sapphire should've won
that race, sure thing.

35:33.500 --> 35:37.458
Even his son bet
ten large ones on him to
win.

35:37.542 --> 35:39.750
So, why'd Sonny do it?

35:39.834 --> 35:42.208
Crackpot, I think he
wanted
to take Firewalker

35:42.291 --> 35:43.792
back to Mexico with him.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.041
Till you killed
Firewalker for the money.

35:46.125 --> 35:49.125
Insurance
investigators
said in all three
reports

35:49.208 --> 35:52.125
faulty wiring
caused those fires.

35:52.208 --> 35:53.917
It's quite a coincidence.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.625
So, another horse
dies in the fire.

35:56.709 --> 36:00.375
Why don't we just call it
a return on my investment?

36:02.458 --> 36:06.750
I beat that thing just
like I
did in 1994 with
Bloodline.

36:08.041 --> 36:10.583
Statute of
limitations,
detectives.

36:10.667 --> 36:11.625
Is that right?

36:11.709 --> 36:12.750
(Valens)
'How's your..'

36:12.834 --> 36:15.208
heart...holding up, Randall?

36:15.291 --> 36:16.834
You beat it in '94 'cause seven

36:16.917 --> 36:18.917
years had passed
that

36:19.000 --> 36:21.458
(Valens)
'Seven years from when
the investigation begins.'

36:21.542 --> 36:23.083
Not...when the
crime
was committed.

36:23.166 --> 36:25.208
Yeah, which in the case
of Firewalker was..

36:25.291 --> 36:26.458
...hmm, an hour ago.

36:26.542 --> 36:29.041
'When we called your
insurance company and..'

36:29.125 --> 36:31.667
...decided to investigate.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.250
Stand up, Baxter.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.458
You're under arrest
for insurance fraud.

36:44.041 --> 36:46.250
From the Treasury Department

36:46.333 --> 36:48.208
I come bearing gifts.

36:48.291 --> 36:50.375
Sonny's safe deposit box.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.250
Inside..

36:52.333 --> 36:55.250
'...a receipt for a plot..'

36:55.333 --> 36:58.125
'..life insurance policy..'

36:58.208 --> 37:01.166
..and a copy
of his last
physical.

37:03.041 --> 37:04.959
Blood in his urine..

37:05.041 --> 37:07.458
...years of bulimia and pills..

37:07.542 --> 37:09.291
That guy was a mess.

37:09.375 --> 37:11.000
Uh, he was getting
his affairs in order.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.792
And look who he left it all to.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.375
Standard bow rake.

37:17.458 --> 37:20.041
One inch width
between each tooth.

37:20.125 --> 37:22.625
Same exact width
between puncture wounds

37:22.709 --> 37:25.083
to the back
of Sonny's skull.

37:25.166 --> 37:27.291
Somebody brained
your old man,
Jose.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.625
It's a terrible way to go out.

37:28.709 --> 37:30.125
Ever cross your mind

37:30.208 --> 37:32.417
your gambling might've cost
your dad his life?

37:32.500 --> 37:35.166
I told you,
I cleaned up before
that.

37:35.250 --> 37:36.709
(Rush)
'Told us a lot
of things, Jose.'

37:36.792 --> 37:38.417
Truth is you bet
large on your dad

37:38.500 --> 37:39.917
and it cost you big.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.375
The job with Baxter
and a lot of coin.

37:42.458 --> 37:45.375
Old man had to go, so you took
him out with a rake like this.

37:45.458 --> 37:48.500
Stable rake. Anyone at
the track had access to
that.

37:48.583 --> 37:49.959
Like Angelo?

37:50.041 --> 37:52.291
What I told you from the start.

37:52.375 --> 37:56.959
Angelo, who...won that
last race against your dad?

37:57.041 --> 37:58.125
Yeah. So?

37:58.208 --> 38:01.000
Angelo, who was
like a son to
him..

38:01.083 --> 38:03.000
...cut from the same
poor streets of
Mexico.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.750
<i>Ah, y un verdadero Mexicano.</i>

38:04.834 --> 38:08.709
Wished he was his son. I mean,
Angelo was a real man. A
jockey.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.542
You? Americanized.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.625
Too big to be a jockey.

38:12.709 --> 38:14.542
A gambler, liar.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.208
'You did nothing but cost him.'

38:16.291 --> 38:18.667
At least I wasn't
a scumbag drug addict.

38:21.125 --> 38:23.500
We found Sonny's
life
insurance policy.

38:25.834 --> 38:27.750
Life insurance?

38:27.834 --> 38:30.583
- My old man?
- Oh, yeah.

38:30.667 --> 38:32.417
Guess who he left everything to?

38:33.917 --> 38:37.625
And I'd be worried if my son
was a...compulsive gambler.

38:37.709 --> 38:39.250
[chuckling]
Why waste the money?

38:39.333 --> 38:41.625
That makes perfect sense
who he left his money to.

38:41.709 --> 38:43.375
- Yeah.
- 'Who?'

38:43.458 --> 38:45.709
Kristi? Angelo? Firewalker?

38:45.792 --> 38:48.375
- They all came before me.
- He paid off your debts.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.041
To save himself
from embarrassment.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.709
The great Sonny Sandoval
couldn't have a loser for a
son.

38:52.792 --> 38:56.000
Now if he'd just won that last
race, you'd have been rollin'.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.542
Damn right.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.083
But no, he had to pull up.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.417
Just to make a point.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.709
Yeah, that he never
cared about me.

39:04.792 --> 39:07.250
You're wrong, Jose.

39:07.333 --> 39:10.166
(Rush)
'The weight loss,
injuries, pills..'

39:10.250 --> 39:12.166
had taken its toll.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.625
Sonny's internal
organs
were...shutting down.

39:14.709 --> 39:17.834
Your pop was makin'
plans to take care

39:17.917 --> 39:19.917
of those he left behind.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.875
My father was dying?

39:22.959 --> 39:26.917
Yeah. Still managed to make
that last payment, though.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.125
And you...were sole beneficiary.

39:31.542 --> 39:34.083
(Valens)
'Left you $3 million.'

39:34.166 --> 39:36.417
(Rush)
'Even after all you
put him through?'

39:38.709 --> 39:40.792
He still loved you, Jose.

39:46.333 --> 39:48.291
I don't understand.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.458
Why couldn't he just tell me?

40:03.583 --> 40:04.959
You happy now?

40:05.041 --> 40:08.125
<i>mi hijo.</i>

40:08.208 --> 40:10.333
I borrowed ten G's.

40:10.834 --> 40:12.458
What?

40:12.542 --> 40:14.417
You promised me, Jose.
You gave me your word.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.583
I bet it
all on
you.
win.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.125
Mi hijo,

40:19.208 --> 40:21.500
When was the last time
you bet on me, poppa?

40:21.583 --> 40:23.417
- Hmm?
- Son.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.750
You're sick, okay?

40:24.834 --> 40:26.375
- You need help.
- Okay, then help me!

40:26.458 --> 40:28.667
- I tried.
- You tried?

40:28.750 --> 40:31.709
By-by-by tanking the race
so that Angelo could win?

40:31.792 --> 40:33.000
I'm your son! Not Angelo!

40:33.083 --> 40:35.166
I-I couldn't win
another race for
Baxter

40:35.250 --> 40:36.875
after what he did to Firewalker.

40:36.959 --> 40:38.500
But I'm the one that pays.

40:38.583 --> 40:41.125
Poppa, it cost me
money and a job!

40:42.500 --> 40:45.375
I have failed you.

40:45.458 --> 40:47.083
I did not want
this life for
you.

40:47.166 --> 40:50.083
you
better than me.

40:50.166 --> 40:52.250
I made so many mistakes.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.000
It's time everyone
knows
the truth, okay?

40:56.083 --> 40:57.834
These horses deserve
better,
and so do jockeys.

40:57.917 --> 41:00.041
What are you talking about?

41:00.125 --> 41:01.583
Poppa, if you do that,
they blackball me.

41:01.667 --> 41:02.917
I'll never be hired
as a trainer again!

41:03.000 --> 41:04.375
No, you'll get
help.
It'll be okay.

41:04.458 --> 41:05.959
- No, no, Poppa.
- Trust me. Don't worry.

41:06.041 --> 41:07.542
I will take care of
everything,
mi hijo.

41:07.625 --> 41:08.959
I'm so sick,
I'm so sick and tired

41:09.041 --> 41:10.542
of waiting for you!
