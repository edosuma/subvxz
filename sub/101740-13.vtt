WEBVTT

00:08.051 --> 00:10.619
Your neighbor wasn't fishing
with his dogs.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.316
He was drowning 'em!

00:12.360 --> 00:14.014
[grunting]Gibbs!

00:14.884 --> 00:16.929
I thought about those dogs.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.018
I reacted.

00:18.061 --> 00:20.063
I have no choice
but to suspend you.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.325
Indefinitely.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.327
I need your badge and your gun.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.415
Hey, how's Gibbs?

00:24.459 --> 00:25.851
I'm not sure. He said,

00:25.895 --> 00:27.636
"There's more to life
than the job."

00:27.679 --> 00:29.377
Gibbs said that?

00:29.420 --> 00:30.421
Yeah.

00:30.465 --> 00:31.857
Oh, body in Reston.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.946
Normally this is when you'd say,
"Grab your gear."

00:33.990 --> 00:37.472
[chuckles]: Yeah.
Eh, not this time.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.650
[ducks quacking]

00:44.827 --> 00:47.351
So I liked her post
and she liked mine.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.875
But then she left
this weird comment, you know?

00:49.919 --> 00:51.486
So I'm still just trying
to figure out

00:51.529 --> 00:52.748
if she's even into me.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.315
Why don't you just,
you know, call her?

00:54.358 --> 00:57.318
Oh, yeah. That's-that's a--
that's a good idea, Grandpa.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.624
And then what?
Take her on a hot date

00:59.668 --> 01:01.626
of shuffleboard
and sarsaparilla?

01:01.670 --> 01:03.454
Would a grandpa haul ass
like this?

01:03.498 --> 01:06.588
Ten bucks says I beat you
to Baker Street bypass!

01:06.631 --> 01:08.416
Make it $20 and you're on!

01:08.459 --> 01:10.635
[chuckles]

01:13.943 --> 01:17.294
[groaning]
Come on!

01:17.338 --> 01:20.645
[groaning]

01:21.472 --> 01:22.430
What happened?

01:22.473 --> 01:24.562
The chain snapped.

01:24.606 --> 01:25.824
Looks like
I'm calling an Uber.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.304
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

01:27.348 --> 01:28.392
You want me to wait for you?

01:28.436 --> 01:30.307
No, I'm fine.
You go ahead.

01:30.351 --> 01:31.787
All right.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.571
Look on the bright side,

01:33.615 --> 01:35.573
you just saved yourself
20 bucks!

01:35.617 --> 01:37.532
[quietly]:
Grandpa.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.055
20 bucks!

01:39.099 --> 01:41.492
Let's see you out here
racing kids half your age,

01:41.536 --> 01:42.885
you little punk.[beeping]

01:42.928 --> 01:44.060
[engine revving,
tires screeching in distance]

01:45.279 --> 01:46.323
Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

01:46.367 --> 01:49.021
[shouts, grunting]

01:49.065 --> 01:50.110
Oh, my God.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.328
[panting]
Hey!

01:51.372 --> 01:53.025
Hey!

01:53.069 --> 01:54.114
[panting]

01:57.247 --> 01:59.119
Mike.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.471
â™ª

02:31.238 --> 02:32.587
[elevator dings]

02:32.630 --> 02:34.110
What the hell is this?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.374
Uh, that appears to be our
firearms qualification, Nick.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.549
I know what it is.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.420
I'm talking about
your perfect score.

02:39.463 --> 02:40.638
Yep.

02:40.682 --> 02:41.422
Yep?

02:41.465 --> 02:42.597
You max it out at 300

02:42.640 --> 02:44.338
and all I got
is a "yep"?

02:44.381 --> 02:45.339
Yep.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.862
I'm good with guns, bro.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.691
[clears throat]
No one is this good, bro.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.345
What are you doing?
Hmm?

02:51.388 --> 02:53.956
You sneaking in hours
at the range?Hmm.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.220
Oh. Okay. That's
how you're gonna play it.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.352
All right, I respect that.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.570
I won't ask you
any more questions.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.006
I'll just ask McGee.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.094
McGee?

03:02.138 --> 03:03.618
What? Yes? What?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.794
You haven't been listening
to our conversation?

03:05.837 --> 03:08.666
No. No, I'm reading the news.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.713
Parker James trial starts today.Parker who?

03:11.756 --> 03:13.410
How many different Parkers
have you arrested?

03:13.454 --> 03:14.672
This Parker James.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.021
Oh, yeah, I remember
this tool.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.719
You should. He ran
the biggest Ponzi scheme

03:17.762 --> 03:20.330
in Navy history.
Stole millions from sailors.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.245
$30 million,
to be exact.[phone rings]

03:22.289 --> 03:24.073
Hello?Actually,
a pretty brilliant scheme.

03:24.116 --> 03:26.684
Well, he confessed to Gibbs, so
he must not be that brilliant.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.904
Well, he was smart enough
to make the money disappear.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.167
Can't spend that money
in prison, baby.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.690
Assuming he's convicted.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.389
Gibbs is testifying.
So, as soon as the jury hears

03:35.432 --> 03:38.043
about James' confession,
it's over.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.698
Thanks. Uh, we got a body.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.614
I say it wrong?

03:43.658 --> 03:44.702
Well, no.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.269
But, usually,
when Gibbs is gone,

03:46.313 --> 03:48.053
I get the "got a body" calls.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.969
Probably got
the wrong extension.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.364
My ringer's not working.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.496
Ah.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.977
[birds chirping][indistinct chatter]

03:59.021 --> 04:00.501
VANCE:
Okay. I'm here, Gibbs.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.850
What's up?

04:01.893 --> 04:03.765
Prosecutor just dropped me
as a witness

04:03.808 --> 04:05.854
in the James case.

04:06.811 --> 04:07.769
Oh.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.249
Good morning to you, too.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.860
You know about this?

04:11.903 --> 04:13.035
Yeah. She called me
a couple days ago.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.863
Said she was leaning that way.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.039
What'd you say?

04:17.082 --> 04:19.128
I told her
whatever choice she made,

04:19.171 --> 04:20.347
we would fully support.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.000
Who's "we"?

04:22.044 --> 04:23.654
The agency.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.874
Oh.
[chuckles]

04:25.917 --> 04:28.572
So you... you agree with her.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.313
Yeah. I do.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.273
Gibbs, you assaulted
an unarmed suspect.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.449
No prosecutor
in their right mind

04:35.492 --> 04:37.277
is going to put a witness
on the stand with that kind

04:37.320 --> 04:38.930
of baggage.Leon, he was-- he was shooting,

04:38.974 --> 04:40.932
he was drowning dogs.

04:42.847 --> 04:43.979
It doesn't matter.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.546
It does to me.Yeah.

04:45.589 --> 04:48.288
Well, you made that clear when
you put him in the hospital.

04:48.331 --> 04:51.203
But the choice you made
has consequences.

04:51.247 --> 04:54.729
What I did has nothing
to do with Parker James.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.208
His defense attorney

04:56.252 --> 04:58.776
will claim it has everything
to do with your credibility.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.649
I never lied.No.

05:01.692 --> 05:05.392
But a jury might find what
you did do a bit unsettling.

05:07.568 --> 05:11.093
I'm the only person
that heard him confess.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.269
I don't take the stand,

05:13.313 --> 05:15.576
this guy will walk.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.360
She thinks she can get
a conviction even without you.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.927
She thinks.

05:18.970 --> 05:22.147
Do you know how many lives
that Parker James destroyed?

05:22.191 --> 05:23.192
Course I do.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.367
So do I.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.934
Call her back.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.544
Fight.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.460
Not this time, Gibbs.

05:32.897 --> 05:36.205
You're just gonna let this guy
go free?

05:36.248 --> 05:37.641
No.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.121
If Parker James walks,

05:39.164 --> 05:40.775
that's on you.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.742
[door opens, bell tinkles]

05:53.657 --> 05:56.921
[siren whooping in distance]

05:58.445 --> 06:00.055
[indistinct radio chatter]

06:00.098 --> 06:03.493
All right. So, Petty Officer
Second Class Michael Benson.

06:03.537 --> 06:04.581
25 years old.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.191
Based on the size
of his calves,

06:06.235 --> 06:08.672
I'd say he spent a good portion
of those years riding a bike.

06:08.716 --> 06:09.804
Any witnesses?

06:09.847 --> 06:11.196
Uh, no, not yet.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.415
Streets are pretty
empty in the morning.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.025
The cops say a jogger found him.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.549
All right.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.767
Talk to me, Jimmy.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.508
You're getting pretty good
at that.

06:18.552 --> 06:19.422
McGEE:
Thanks.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.554
Work in progress.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.251
He's got massive
soft tissue damage

06:22.294 --> 06:24.601
on his torso and arms.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.821
He was struck
at quite a high speed.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.040
Judging by the depth
of this gash on his head,

06:29.084 --> 06:31.956
I'd say
he hit the pavement pretty hard.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.045
You know,
I don't see skid marks.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.830
The vehicle
didn't even slow down.

06:35.873 --> 06:36.918
McGEE:
So our driver

06:36.961 --> 06:39.137
was either asleep or drunk.

06:39.181 --> 06:42.227
Or maybe this wasn't
an accident.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.708
Uh... guys?

06:46.493 --> 06:48.277
Got another bike.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.496
[siren wails in distance]

06:49.539 --> 06:51.628
No frame damage
on this one. But...

06:51.672 --> 06:53.804
chain's broken.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.242
Looks like our petty officer
wasn't riding alone.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.462
So we're not only missing
a vehicle,

06:59.506 --> 07:01.464
we're missing a witness.

07:01.508 --> 07:04.336
I saw a camera up there
that caught the crime scene.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.210
If we're lucky, it'll,
uh, help us find 'em both.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.734
KASIE:
This is why I don't
ride bikes on streets.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.040
Streets are for cars.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.955
Just like the ocean
is for sharks.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.435
Which is also
why I don't...

07:15.478 --> 07:16.305
Kasie.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.480
Yeah.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.742
Uh, video, please.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.178
Oh. Yeah, okay.
And before you ask,

07:20.222 --> 07:23.834
no, I cannot zoom in
any more than this.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.404
Only one cyclist?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.492
For now.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.885
Okay. So I guess that rules out

07:30.928 --> 07:31.886
license plate number.

07:31.929 --> 07:32.930
What about make and model?

07:32.974 --> 07:34.366
Uh, no and no.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.368
Black sedan is
all you're gonna get.

07:36.412 --> 07:39.023
But there is a second act.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.331
The mystery second rider.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.812
Hmm. He must have seen
the hit-and-run.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.074
KASIE:
Where's his bike?

07:46.117 --> 07:47.510
TORRES:
Broken chain.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.729
What's he doing?

07:48.772 --> 07:49.817
He's looking around

07:49.860 --> 07:51.427
to make sure the coast is clear.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.995
TORRES:Dude, what are you
doing? Call 911.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.779
Check for a pulse
or something.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.999
Oh, he does something.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.873
What the hell?

08:02.917 --> 08:04.179
My thoughts exactly.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.050
I mean, what kind of a monster

08:06.094 --> 08:07.704
would leave their friend to die?

08:07.748 --> 08:09.967
The kind who knows something
we don't.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.195
Petty Officer Benson.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.110
Assigned to
NSA Bethesda.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.939
C.O. said that he was
a model sailor.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.723
Parents said
everybody loved him.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.377
Parents always say that.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.421
But someone driving

08:29.465 --> 08:30.858
a black sedan didn't love him.

08:30.901 --> 08:31.902
Not really feeling the love

08:31.946 --> 08:33.295
from his bike partner either.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.297
Can't wait to find this guy.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.733
McGEE:
Yeah. First,
we got to find out

08:36.777 --> 08:38.169
who this guy is.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.432
What? Didn't Kasie run
the prints off his bike?

08:40.476 --> 08:42.217
Yeah. He's not in the system.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.001
We have to find another
way to I.D. him.

08:44.045 --> 08:47.570
Any theories on why this guy
ran from the crime scene?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.616
I don't know.
Maybe he was in on it.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.835
That would explain
why he vanished.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.576
Those outfits they're wearing,
those expensive bikes--

08:53.620 --> 08:54.969
you think maybe
they're part of a team?

08:55.012 --> 08:56.405
Way ahead of you.

08:56.448 --> 08:59.103
Petty Officer Benson
was part of a club called

08:59.147 --> 09:00.583
the D.C. Cyclists.
And we figure

09:00.627 --> 09:02.585
our mystery biker
was a member, too.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.761
Nice. Want to call 'em,
get the club roster?

09:04.805 --> 09:06.415
Again, way ahead of you.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.939
But before you get too excited,
there's, like, over 600 members,

09:08.983 --> 09:12.160
so there's got to be
a faster way to I.D. this guy.[phone chimes]

09:12.943 --> 09:14.554
Oh. Find a faster way.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.643
Jimmy's got something.
I'm headed to Autopsy.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.036
[sighs]

09:19.080 --> 09:21.473
TORRES:
Hmm. Any ideas?

09:22.431 --> 09:24.128
Ellie?Hmm?

09:24.172 --> 09:25.216
Any ideas?

09:25.260 --> 09:27.567
Sorry. I was
just thinking, uh...

09:27.610 --> 09:30.613
you know, it's usually Gibbs
who heads to Autopsy.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.229
[quiet chatter]

09:42.016 --> 09:43.670
You wanted the front seat, too?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.977
Parker James.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.631
I saw you
staring at him.

09:48.675 --> 09:51.460
Did the son of a
bitch get you, too?

09:52.766 --> 09:54.724
No. Not exactly.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.987
MAUDE:
Oh. Well, you're lucky.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.947
Bastard stole my husband's
entire Navy pension.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.646
I'm sorry about that.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.605
Well, I just hope

10:05.648 --> 10:07.650
they shank his dumb ass
in prison.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.478
[chuckles softly]Pardon my French.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.220
Agent Gibbs.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.091
Attorney Addison.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.266
Didn't you hear?

10:15.310 --> 10:17.225
I removed you
from my witness list.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.140
Yeah, I heard.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.620
Put me back on.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.665
I'm sorry.
If I called you as a witness,

10:22.709 --> 10:25.842
I'd have to disclose your arrest
and suspension.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.844
Disclose it.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.541
And have the defense

10:29.585 --> 10:31.848
eviscerate you on the stand?
No, thank you.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.415
I can handle it.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.112
It's not you I'm worried about.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.853
It's the jury.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.987
I'm sorry, Agent Gibbs.
Your credibility is a liability.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.685
Credibility.

10:42.729 --> 10:46.863
I heard that... a lot.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.386
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.084
Losing you is a blow
to the case,

10:50.127 --> 10:54.697
but we still have one surefire
witness taking the stand--

10:54.741 --> 10:56.699
James's accountant.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.832
His testimony alone
is enough

10:58.875 --> 10:59.876
to get us a conviction.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.312
BAILIFF:
All rise.

11:01.356 --> 11:05.839
The Honorable
Monica Perez now presiding.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.104
You may be seated.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.373
Jimmy.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.722
Hey, what you got?

11:19.766 --> 11:21.419
I have shards of metal
that were embedded

11:21.463 --> 11:23.073
in Petty Officer Benson's hip.

11:23.117 --> 11:26.729
Uh, must have come from
the vehicle that struck him.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.688
And this poor guy
never stood a chance.

11:28.731 --> 11:31.473
Massive internal
bleeding at the-- Oh!

11:31.516 --> 11:33.475
Let me show you this.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.304
Black paint on his helmet.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.609
Must have come
from the car that hit him.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.307
Enough there
to pull a sample from?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.091
I already sent it off to Kasie.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.485
Kasie already ran it.
My handy dandy

11:43.528 --> 11:47.054
spectrophotometer ID'd the color
as Iridium Black,

11:47.097 --> 11:49.926
a shade used
in older Chevy Cruze models.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.624
Ah, nice job, Kasie.Oh.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.930
Glad to see
you're happy about it.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.453
And you're about
to be even happier

11:55.497 --> 11:56.846
because I think

11:56.890 --> 11:59.283
I also found our mystery biker.

11:59.327 --> 12:00.589
How's that?

12:00.632 --> 12:02.460
The D.C. Cycle club
has their own app

12:02.504 --> 12:03.940
to track
and post rides.

12:03.984 --> 12:06.029
Like a virtual
scoreboard?
Exactly.

12:06.073 --> 12:08.466
But also with a social messaging
component.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.904
Benson got an invite
to ride this morning

12:10.947 --> 12:13.645
from a user named
SpeedRacer7298.

12:13.689 --> 12:17.867
I cross-referenced their
membership roster, and got...

12:17.911 --> 12:21.262
Bernard Wilson,
lives in Silver Spring.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.785
You're kidding me.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.439
What is it?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.223
Well, Bernard Wilson is
the star witness

12:26.267 --> 12:27.311
in Parker James' trial.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.009
The Ponzi scheme guy?

12:29.052 --> 12:31.272
Yeah. Wilson was his accountant.

12:31.315 --> 12:34.754
So the only guy that could put
Parker James away for life

12:34.797 --> 12:37.017
just happens to be the witness
in a hit-and-run?

12:37.060 --> 12:39.976
And was also wearing
the exact same outfit and helmet

12:40.020 --> 12:41.848
as the guy who got hit.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.198
Maybe Wilson wasn't supposed
to be a witness.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.808
Maybe he was supposed
to be the target.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.375
Based on his profile history,

12:47.418 --> 12:50.378
he takes this exact same ride
three mornings a week.

12:50.421 --> 12:51.814
That would explain
why he was running.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.250
He knew that car
was meant for him.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.817
[phone buttons beeping]If that driver finds out

12:54.861 --> 12:56.514
that they killed
the wrong person...

12:56.558 --> 12:58.299
Wilson is still in danger.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.475
Torres, Kasie's gonna
text you an address.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.782
You and Bishop go there now.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.523
RENFRO:The defense has no
further questions

13:05.567 --> 13:06.829
for this witness,
Your Honor.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.614
Call your next witness,
Counselor.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.836
The prosecution calls
Bernard Wilson to the stand.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.670
[whispering]

13:22.802 --> 13:24.455
[Addison whispering]

13:24.499 --> 13:25.935
Counselor?

13:25.979 --> 13:28.198
[whispering]Counselor?

13:28.242 --> 13:29.721
Uh, Your Honor,

13:29.765 --> 13:31.375
we request a recess.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.421
Our witness is delayed.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.597
[gallery murmuring]

13:35.640 --> 13:36.685
Delayed?

13:36.728 --> 13:37.904
ADDISON:
We're trying

13:37.947 --> 13:39.035
to locate him now.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.341
You've got the day

13:40.384 --> 13:41.821
to find your witness.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.170
Court's adjourned.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.562
All rise.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.087
[gallery murmuring]

13:47.130 --> 13:50.003
[phone vibrating]

13:50.046 --> 13:51.178
Better get that.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.483
[vibrating continues]

13:52.527 --> 13:54.398
Could be important.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.705
[vibrating continues]

13:58.185 --> 14:00.143
Bishop?

14:00.187 --> 14:01.928
Hey, Gibbs, you
still in court?

14:01.971 --> 14:04.495
Ah, no. We just broke.

14:04.539 --> 14:05.845
Witness didn't show.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.368
Bernard Wilson?

14:07.411 --> 14:08.586
Uh, yeah.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.458
What do you know about him?

14:10.501 --> 14:12.547
Mr. Wilson, NCIS!
Open up!

14:12.590 --> 14:15.028
BISHOP:
He was the, uh, the target
of a hit-and-run,

14:15.071 --> 14:16.856
and he got away unharmed.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.292
We're at his house,
but he's not answering,

14:18.335 --> 14:21.469
so, what do you think?
Should we bust in?

14:21.512 --> 14:23.514
Why are you asking me, Bishop?

14:23.558 --> 14:25.865
It's not my call.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.565
Nick?

14:33.655 --> 14:34.917
[quiet chatter]

14:34.961 --> 14:35.918
Bishop?

14:41.706 --> 14:44.057
Bishop! Talk to me.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.888
GIBBS:
Bishop?

14:52.239 --> 14:53.936
Well,

14:53.980 --> 14:55.720
we found him, Gibbs, but...

14:55.764 --> 14:57.505
somebody else
found him first.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.043
McGEE:
All right, Bernard Wilson,

15:14.087 --> 15:15.523
shot in the head
in his own home.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.873
Hours after
he witnessed the hit-and-run

15:17.917 --> 15:19.701
of Petty Officer Benson.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.965
It took two tries,
but the killer got their target.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.314
No signs of forced entry.

15:24.358 --> 15:25.881
You think he knew his killer?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.491
This has Parker James
written all over it.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.058
I mean,
he didn't pull the trigger,

15:29.102 --> 15:30.494
but he ordered that hit.

15:30.538 --> 15:33.236
From behind bars?
It's easier said than done.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.891
All visitor conversations
and phone calls are monitored.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.198
Yeah, but no conversations
with lawyers.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.373
It wasn't his lawyer.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.722
It's always the lawyer.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.202
Not this time.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.855
No, I've known Todd Renfro
for years.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.162
He may be a dirtbag,
but he's not a killer.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.251
Well, then, who else
did James talk to?

15:48.295 --> 15:50.906
Well, according
to his prison records,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.995
besides his lawyer,
his wife came once,

15:53.039 --> 15:54.431
and a woman named
"Hanna Devereaux"

15:54.475 --> 15:57.086
has visited him 33 times.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.567
33 visits to a Ponzi criminal?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.569
Okay, that's totally normal.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.136
Hanna Devereaux have an address?

16:03.179 --> 16:04.615
Uh, right here. Wife, too.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.400
All right, Nick and I will
go talk to the wife.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.054
Bishop, Miss 33's all yours.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.620
Okay.

16:11.013 --> 16:14.321
It all depends. At the Bellagio,
I typically start

16:14.364 --> 16:15.975
at about $10,000 a hand.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.673
But once the whiskey sours
kick in, I tend to go bigger.

16:18.716 --> 16:22.633
[laughs]
A two-bedroom
penthouse suite, huh?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.984
And the entire stay is
on the house?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.115
Sounds good.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.378
I'll see you soon. Ha.

16:28.422 --> 16:29.727
Okay, I'm not sure
where you're going,

16:29.771 --> 16:31.512
but if you have
an extra bedroom...

16:31.555 --> 16:35.603
That was the VIP concierge
at the Macau Island Casino.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.997
[Kasie laughs]Sold. When do we leave?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.259
When you have enough money

16:39.302 --> 16:40.695
to back up the promises
I just made.

16:40.738 --> 16:43.306
Why do I have a feeling
this is about Parker James?

16:43.350 --> 16:44.916
Because you see
Parker James documents

16:44.960 --> 16:47.571
all over my computer.Yeah, I see his face up there

16:47.615 --> 16:49.051
on the plasma, as well.Mm-hmm.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.183
Yes, this is

16:50.226 --> 16:51.880
beginning to remind me
a lot of last year

16:51.923 --> 16:53.360
when you went down
the same rabbit hole,

16:53.403 --> 16:54.883
trying to track down
all the money he stole.

16:54.926 --> 16:58.495
$30 million that, mysteriously,
no one ever found.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.931
Yeah, but he claimed that...

16:59.975 --> 17:01.368
that he lost it all
in the market, right?

17:01.411 --> 17:03.413
There you go.
I remember that look.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.502
You gave that to me the
last time I asked that question.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.417
Well, then, you also remember
that the FBI thinks

17:07.461 --> 17:08.766
he blew it all gambling.

17:08.810 --> 17:12.727
At the, uh,
Macau Island Casino?Exactly.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.555
They traced
wire transfers there,

17:14.598 --> 17:16.818
and he proceeded to gamble
like a madman, except...

17:16.861 --> 17:18.124
Check this out.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.647
There's a room charge

17:19.690 --> 17:22.563
for four grand.
Weird, right?

17:22.606 --> 17:25.566
Yeah. Why is that weird?

17:25.609 --> 17:27.742
Jimmy, have you ever been
to Vegas?

17:27.785 --> 17:29.048
Uh, no.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.224
Have you at least seen
the movie Casino?

17:31.267 --> 17:32.921
[stammers]:
Again, no.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.314
Oh, God help you.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.490
If someone blows
$30 million gambling,

17:36.533 --> 17:38.013
they're gonna comp their room.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.017
Plus, meals, drinks,
whatever the gambler wants.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.627
But the Macau Island Casino

17:43.671 --> 17:46.543
charged Parker for a Snickers
from the minibar.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.937
So, this casino's
really stingy then?

17:48.980 --> 17:51.635
Or he never actually
gambled the money.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.855
What if he exchanged
the money for chips

17:53.898 --> 17:56.597
like he was gonna gamble,
but never actually did?

17:56.640 --> 17:59.078
So you think that he just left
with the chips?

17:59.121 --> 18:02.690
Mm, possibly. There's no
expiration date on casino chips.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.300
Well, then why wouldn't
the casino just tell the Feds

18:04.344 --> 18:05.606
that he never gambled?

18:05.649 --> 18:07.173
Because for right now,

18:07.216 --> 18:08.696
the casino's up $30 million.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.133
Plus, they don't have
to cooperate with the Feds

18:11.177 --> 18:12.613
because the casino's in China.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.571
Hmm. Well,
if that theory is correct,

18:14.615 --> 18:18.140
then, the real question becomes,
where are those chips?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.794
And the second question is,

18:19.837 --> 18:22.492
how have you never seen
the movie Casino?

18:22.536 --> 18:24.364
It's rated R.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.974
Oh, my God.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.280
[knocking]

18:27.323 --> 18:28.890
Yes. Come in.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.154
Thanks for seeing me, Director.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.547
Of course, Ms. Addison.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.157
I'm going to skip
the pleasantries,

18:35.201 --> 18:36.767
because frankly,
I'm not in the mood.

18:36.811 --> 18:39.509
Well, having a key witness
murdered can do that.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.163
That's why I'm here.

18:41.207 --> 18:44.166
Cards on the table. Can you
directly tie Parker James

18:44.210 --> 18:45.472
to the Wilson homicide?

18:45.515 --> 18:47.822
If I can tell the judge
that my defendant

18:47.865 --> 18:49.867
is going to be charged
with the murder of my witness,

18:49.911 --> 18:51.913
that will earn me
a long continuance.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.654
And if not?

18:53.697 --> 18:56.178
Trial continues
tomorrow morning.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.876
I see.

18:58.920 --> 19:03.229
Well, confidentially,
James is our number-one suspect,

19:03.272 --> 19:06.101
but we haven't figured out yet
how he ordered the murder.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.669
How solid is your fraud
case at this point?

19:08.712 --> 19:11.367
Quick answer--
it's in shambles.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.326
Now, I only have one night
to regroup

19:13.369 --> 19:14.849
and figure out my options.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.417
Is one option reconsidering

19:17.460 --> 19:19.549
calling Agent Gibbs
to the stand?

19:19.593 --> 19:21.421
Everything's back on the table.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.988
Why? Is that a problem?

19:24.032 --> 19:26.687
I don't want to overstep
here, Ms. Addison,

19:26.730 --> 19:29.907
but Hail Marys rarely work.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.301
And this Hail Mary would come
at a very severe cost.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.781
I understand.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.217
As I'm sure you understand

19:35.261 --> 19:36.740
that I can't allow
your agent's reputation

19:36.784 --> 19:38.960
to dictate
how I conduct my case.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.918
My priority is getting
a conviction.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.703
So is mine.
I want Parker James

19:42.746 --> 19:44.748
to pay for his crimes
as much as anyone.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.360
But putting Gibbs on the stand

19:47.403 --> 19:49.623
does not guarantee
a guilty verdict.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.886
I'm aware. This could blow up
in both our faces.

19:51.929 --> 19:55.150
Which is why I took him off
the witness list to begin with.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.460
[sighs]
I got to go prep.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.463
Oh, uh, one more thing.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.856
These rumors I'm hearing
about what Gibbs did--

20:05.900 --> 20:08.990
any chance they're overblown?

20:09.033 --> 20:11.210
No.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.733
Okay then.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.126
Thank you, Director.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.825
[door closes]

20:22.308 --> 20:23.570
[dogs barking]

20:23.613 --> 20:25.049
This is the wrong place.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.268
[indistinct chatter]

20:26.312 --> 20:28.618
No, says here
it's the right address.

20:28.662 --> 20:32.405
Wow. The wife
of Parker James lives here?

20:32.448 --> 20:36.060
I guess $30 million doesn't go
as far as it used to.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.411
Charlotte James?

20:38.454 --> 20:40.413
[groans]
Would you just stop already?

20:40.456 --> 20:42.719
I can't pay you,
so quit hassling me.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.330
Yeah, we're not
debt collectors.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.548
NCIS.

20:45.592 --> 20:46.854
What do you want?

20:46.897 --> 20:48.725
Well, Mrs. James...Uh, no,

20:48.769 --> 20:50.510
it's not Mrs. James anymore.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.294
It's Ms. Bodizinski.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.730
I took back my maiden name,

20:53.774 --> 20:55.471
which I couldn't wait
to get rid of,

20:55.515 --> 20:58.082
and now I'm ecstatic
to have it back.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.128
Okay, uh, Ms....

21:00.171 --> 21:01.260
Charlotte's fine.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.174
And I can guess why you're here.

21:03.218 --> 21:06.047
You want to talk
about my soon-to-be ex-husband.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.396
You going somewhere?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.093
You could say that.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.573
Oh, I'm being evicted.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.532
From this?

21:12.575 --> 21:15.274
What can I say?
Life's a bitch.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.797
Parker stole $30 million,

21:16.840 --> 21:19.278
and I can't pay rent
on this hellhole.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.584
Speaking of Parker,
we noticed you visited him

21:21.628 --> 21:23.325
in prison last month.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.066
That's why you're here?

21:25.109 --> 21:27.677
[chuckles]
Have either of you
ever tried to divorce

21:27.721 --> 21:29.636
a federal inmate?

21:29.679 --> 21:31.768
Uh, thankfully, no.Mm-mm.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.336
Oh, it's a whole thing--
the paperwork,

21:34.380 --> 21:37.557
the notary-- and it all
has to be done in person.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.776
He signed. I left.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.648
Now he can rot in jail.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.302
Well, he might not.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.305
Do you know his accountant,
Bernard Wilson?

21:46.348 --> 21:48.132
Yeah, I know Bernie.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.483
Oh, don't tell me,
he got cold feet

21:50.526 --> 21:52.398
and decided not to testify.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.791
No, he was killed this morning.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.098
[quietly]:
Oh, Parker.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.578
That son of a bitch.

21:58.621 --> 22:02.190
You think of any old friends
or business associates

22:02.233 --> 22:04.801
he might have had
that might be willing
to kill for him?

22:04.845 --> 22:07.630
Parker worked
with Wall Street types, not...

22:07.674 --> 22:09.328
not murderers.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.417
What about Hanna Devereaux?

22:11.460 --> 22:12.896
That whack-job?

22:12.940 --> 22:16.030
Maybe. She is psycho.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.772
What exactly is her relationship
with Parker?

22:18.815 --> 22:20.687
She's Parker's new girlfriend.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.819
She accosted me
in the prison waiting room

22:22.863 --> 22:24.821
and said Parker was
all hers now.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.041
I said, "You can have him."

22:27.084 --> 22:28.216
Can I go pack up

22:28.259 --> 22:30.044
the rest of my crap now?

22:35.484 --> 22:38.182
[elevator dings, doors close]

22:41.229 --> 22:42.578
NCIS.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.058
Special Agent Bishop.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.494
I'm looking for
Hanna Devereaux.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.017
What's this about?

22:47.061 --> 22:48.192
You her father?

22:48.236 --> 22:50.847
Yeah. But she's not home
right now.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.327
Where is she?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.416
Uh, I don't know.
Come back later.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.940
Wait, uh,
this is about Parker James.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.334
Did something happen?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.641
Why would you ask that?

23:04.339 --> 23:06.907
There's something
you should see.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.051
Wow.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.403
RANDY:
That's one way to put it.

23:25.273 --> 23:26.927
This is not like
my daughter.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.712
She's a sweet,
innocent young woman

23:29.756 --> 23:33.716
who somehow
became infatuated with him.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.545
It's unhealthy.
It's borderline deranged.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.026
Yeah, no,
nothing borderline about this.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.462
So, how did they meet?

23:40.506 --> 23:42.464
She saw him on the news.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.902
She decided to write a letter
to him in prison.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.905
He responded,
asking her to visit him.

23:48.949 --> 23:52.605
After that, they were...
they were off to the races.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.912
So, are these, uh,
these his love letters?

23:55.956 --> 23:58.001
RANDY:
Yeah. Hanna saves them all.

23:58.045 --> 24:01.396
I've researched women
who date inmates.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.616
It never ends well.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.533
Have you noticed any changes
in her behavior?

24:07.576 --> 24:10.753
She's isolating herself
from her friends. From me.

24:10.797 --> 24:14.931
From anyone who thinks
dating Parker James is insane.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.020
Mind if I...

24:17.064 --> 24:18.108
take this one?

24:18.152 --> 24:19.283
No. Please.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.329
Thanks.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.595
I-Is Hanna in trouble?

24:26.639 --> 24:28.815
I just need to talk to her.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.120
So do I.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.470
She's been gone all day.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.733
She didn't even take her phone.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.778
I'm guessing that's not normal?

24:35.822 --> 24:36.779
No.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.565
Now I'm really getting worried.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.048
[whines]

24:45.092 --> 24:46.659
What?

24:46.702 --> 24:47.964
[whining]

24:48.008 --> 24:49.575
[chuckling]:
No, no, no, no, no.

24:49.618 --> 24:51.446
Don't look at me like that.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.492
I already made up my mind.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.450
I was afraid being home alone

24:55.494 --> 24:57.539
might get to you
after a while, but...

24:57.583 --> 24:59.498
man, that escalated quickly.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.848
[whines]She's not talking
back, is she?

25:02.718 --> 25:05.068
No. Hell of a listener,
though.

25:05.112 --> 25:08.028
You expecting someone?

25:08.071 --> 25:09.682
Yeah.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.033
You.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.513
Am I that predictable?

25:14.556 --> 25:16.210
Prosecutor changed her mind.

25:16.253 --> 25:19.169
Wants me to testify.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.475
I thought...

25:20.519 --> 25:22.390
you might want to talk
about that.

25:22.433 --> 25:23.870
Yeah, you thought right.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.832
Parker James's
lawyer, Renfro,

25:29.876 --> 25:31.878
he charges six figures
for a reason.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.097
The guy's a pit bull. He...

25:34.141 --> 25:35.751
Luce, sorry.

25:35.795 --> 25:38.014
No offense.[whines]

25:38.058 --> 25:39.929
You talking to dogs now?

25:39.973 --> 25:41.452
I mean it, Gibbs.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.063
Renfro's ruthless.

25:43.106 --> 25:46.022
He'll flip the script--
he'll put you on trial.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.894
This is not about me.

25:47.937 --> 25:50.157
Well, it is if
you testify.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.856
You'll have to describe
the assault in graphic detail.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.816
Everything will
be on the record.

25:57.730 --> 26:01.647
Not ashamed of what I did, Leon.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.039
Well, you should be.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.825
If you testify, you could
actually help James.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.566
How are you gonna feel, Gibbs,

26:07.609 --> 26:10.830
if you're the reason
that he goes free?

26:10.873 --> 26:14.703
Better than if I sat around
and did nothing.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.271
If you do this,

26:17.314 --> 26:19.839
there's no looking back.

26:19.882 --> 26:23.451
Your career at NCIS
could very well be over.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.588
Leon, I'm sorry. I am.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.328
It's a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.427
[elevator dings]

26:43.471 --> 26:44.515
[indistinct chatter]

26:44.559 --> 26:46.909
Kasie. Hey, what you got?

26:46.953 --> 26:49.869
Local LEOs found it
abandoned in a cornfield

26:49.912 --> 26:52.611
less than two miles
from where Benson was hit.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.657
It's a good amount of damage.
You think this is our, uh...

26:55.701 --> 26:57.354
Our hit-and-run
vehicle?

26:57.398 --> 27:00.053
Yep. The metal shards
Jimmy pulled from the body

27:00.096 --> 27:01.924
are a match to the
windshield wipers,

27:01.968 --> 27:03.926
and the paint
is a match to the car.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.363
Great. You able
to run the VIN?

27:06.407 --> 27:08.104
Yep.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.628
And?

27:09.671 --> 27:12.761
78-year-old dude in Ohio
reported it stolen

27:12.805 --> 27:14.371
three weeks ago.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.635
[groans]So the driver
could be anyone.

27:16.678 --> 27:17.940
[hisses]
Yep.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.550
You need a hand
with that?No.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.204
Okay. You okay, Kase?

27:21.248 --> 27:22.641
Yep.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.860
Okay. We'll leave you...

27:24.904 --> 27:26.340
to it.Mm-hmm.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.951
I mean, it's not like
I could've known.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.997
I was still a temp
back then.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.302
How was I supposed to know?

27:32.346 --> 27:34.827
Sorry. Uh,
known what?

27:34.870 --> 27:37.133
That Gibbs does not know
how to operate

27:37.177 --> 27:39.658
even the most
rudimentary technology.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.790
Oh, for the love of...

27:41.834 --> 27:43.313
I'm the reason we didn't get

27:43.357 --> 27:46.186
the Parker James confession
on tape, all right?

27:46.229 --> 27:49.450
You mean because you wired Gibbs
for the undercover meeting?

27:49.493 --> 27:53.497
Yes. And I assumed he would
turn on the recording device.

27:53.541 --> 27:56.500
And he assumed I would do it,
because everybody knows

27:56.544 --> 27:59.678
you don't leave any kind of
technological buttons to Gibbs.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.244
Well, the temp didn't know

28:01.288 --> 28:03.029
you don't leave the buttons
to Gibbs.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.466
Kasie, you can't beat
yourself up about it.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.293
Mm.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.816
Okay, that's it. I'm done.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.209
What? You're quitting?

28:09.252 --> 28:11.994
No. I'm done dusting for prints.

She gets back up and she finds
the freakin' evidence.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.044
So what'd you find?

28:18.087 --> 28:19.175
[sighs]
Nothing.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.220
Car was wiped clean.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.700
The only thing I know for sure

28:21.743 --> 28:24.050
is I tweaked my back
squeezing out of there.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.705
Whoever was driving
had really short legs.[phone chimes]

28:26.748 --> 28:29.098
How tall is
Hanna Devereaux?

28:29.142 --> 28:31.013
Uh, don't know.
But the prison

28:31.057 --> 28:32.275
detained her on a visit
to James.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.624
She's in Interrogation now.

28:33.668 --> 28:34.887
Thanks, Kasie.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.845
See ya.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.413
K-Hines don't quit.

28:40.675 --> 28:43.417
I have this talent
for writing letters.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.419
Parker fell in love with me
on paper,

28:45.462 --> 28:47.595
one paragraph
into the first page.

28:47.638 --> 28:50.032
Then he fell in love
with me off paper, too.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.033
BISHOP:
Mm.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.731
You, uh, sure

28:52.774 --> 28:54.036
you're the only one he's dating,

28:54.080 --> 28:55.821
on paper or otherwise?

28:56.647 --> 28:59.694
I know how this looks,
but this isn't some fantasy.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.044
We're getting married
as soon as he gets out.

29:02.088 --> 29:05.352
You have a date set,
Ms. Devereaux?

29:05.395 --> 29:07.484
[sighs]
Agent McGee,

29:07.528 --> 29:10.487
would you just excuse
us for a minute?

29:20.846 --> 29:23.196
Hanna, I am so sorry.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.764
[chuckles] Half of these guys
that I work with,

29:25.807 --> 29:28.897
they wouldn't understand love
if it smacked 'em in the face.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.769
[scoffs]

29:30.812 --> 29:31.944
My dad's the same way.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.772
[chuckles softly][sniffles]

29:33.815 --> 29:35.512
[door opens]BISHOP: So...

29:36.470 --> 29:38.951
I like the play, McGee.
You make a damn good skeptic.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.910
And Bishop
a surprisingly good romantic.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.259
Her idea, by the way.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.479
Possible Parker James
had the same one.

29:45.522 --> 29:49.265
Human connection
with an unstable loner.

29:49.309 --> 29:52.094
He had her
in the palm of his hand.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.444
Can I tell you something?

29:54.488 --> 29:55.837
Yeah.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.057
Parker's innocent.

29:58.100 --> 30:01.321
You think
this whole Ponzi scheme thing,

30:01.364 --> 30:02.757
you think he's being framed?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.324
Yes.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.934
Or it was
a smear campaign.

30:05.978 --> 30:09.024
But Parker would never steal
from anyone.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.461
Is that...

30:11.505 --> 30:14.987
is that why you
had to do this?

30:16.205 --> 30:18.033
I don't...

30:18.077 --> 30:19.687
I'm not following.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.125
You know,

30:23.169 --> 30:25.258
I have someone
who's really special to me.

30:25.301 --> 30:28.522
And I trust him with my life.

30:28.565 --> 30:29.915
And...

30:29.958 --> 30:33.396
if he ever asked me
to do something to help him,

30:33.440 --> 30:36.530
I would. I would in, like,
a heartbeat. [chuckles]

30:36.573 --> 30:39.054
Is that how you feel
about Parker?

30:40.534 --> 30:42.579
Yeah.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.146
So, Hanna, um,

30:44.190 --> 30:47.019
where were you
yesterday morning?

30:47.062 --> 30:49.499
Were you--
were you driving this car?

30:50.283 --> 30:51.501
Yesterday morning,

30:51.545 --> 30:53.547
I was doing something secret.

30:53.590 --> 30:58.769
Like, secret, like...
for Parker?

30:58.813 --> 31:00.902
I went to D.C.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.425
There's a congressman.

31:02.469 --> 31:04.123
He's gonna help free Parker.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.994
I sat right in front
of his office,

31:06.038 --> 31:08.954
and I wrote him
a letter-- 23 pages.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.521
There's no way he can say "no"
to 23 pages from me.

31:11.565 --> 31:15.090
Oh.I have a talent for letters.

31:15.134 --> 31:17.266
Ah.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.790
And what exactly
did he say to you?

31:19.834 --> 31:21.662
He said
that he needed more clients

31:21.705 --> 31:24.317
for a Ponzi scheme
he was running.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.536
And is that man
in this courtroom today?

31:26.580 --> 31:28.756
Yes.

31:28.799 --> 31:31.367
ADDISON:
Let the record show
that the witness

31:31.411 --> 31:34.283
has identified
the defendant, Parker James.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.024
Thank you, Agent Gibbs,

31:36.068 --> 31:40.202
not only for your testimony,
but also your decades of service

31:40.246 --> 31:43.510
in both the Marines
and the federal law enforcement.

31:43.553 --> 31:46.600
Marine Corps
Good Conduct Medal,

31:46.643 --> 31:50.517
a Purple Heart
and a Silver Star.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.259
You've had an exemplary career,
haven't you, sir?

31:53.302 --> 31:55.826
That's not for me to say.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.917
Well, I think your record
and commendations speak

31:58.960 --> 31:59.830
for themselves.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.136
It's men and
women like you

32:01.180 --> 32:03.486
that keep the
rest of us safe.

32:03.530 --> 32:06.315
No more questions, Your Honor.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.671
Hanna Devereaux--
she might be crazy, but

32:14.715 --> 32:15.672
she's not our killer.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.283
And Congressman McGrath said

32:17.326 --> 32:20.634
that she was sitting outside
of his office all day yesterday.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.766
Takes a long time
to write 23 pages.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.943
Especially when it all rhymes.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.074
Really?

32:26.118 --> 32:27.336
Yup.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.469
"Parker James went down

32:29.512 --> 32:31.906
"in flames,
but he's not to blames,

32:31.950 --> 32:33.212
he was frames."

32:33.255 --> 32:34.430
Frames?

32:34.474 --> 32:35.910
BISHOP:
Yeah. She was

32:35.954 --> 32:37.520
really committed
to the rhyme scheme.

32:37.564 --> 32:40.349
Regardless, this puts us back
at square one.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.916
Without a murder suspect,

32:41.960 --> 32:43.700
we can't prove
that James ordered the hit.

32:43.744 --> 32:45.528
Which makes,
uh, Gibbs' testimony

32:45.572 --> 32:47.530
that much more important.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.405
RENFRO:
Good afternoon,

32:52.448 --> 32:55.408
Agent Gibbs, or...

32:55.451 --> 32:58.063
should I say "Mr. Gibbs"?

32:58.106 --> 32:59.890
I'll answer to either.

32:59.934 --> 33:04.373
But "Mr. Gibbs" would be
more accurate, wouldn't it?

33:04.417 --> 33:06.158
Considering the fact

33:06.201 --> 33:08.203
that you're not currently
a special agent?

33:08.247 --> 33:12.381
Objection. Agent Gibbs is still
under the employ of NCIS.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.600
Sustained.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.080
My apologies.

33:15.123 --> 33:18.735
Yes, the witness is still
technically a special agent.

33:18.779 --> 33:19.998
An agent who

33:20.041 --> 33:22.304
no longer has possession
of his service weapon

33:22.348 --> 33:23.914
or badge.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.873
Tell us why,

33:25.916 --> 33:27.918
Agent Gibbs.

33:27.962 --> 33:30.182
I was suspended.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.227
For how long?

33:32.271 --> 33:34.142
Indefinitely.

33:34.186 --> 33:37.189
For what reason?

33:37.232 --> 33:39.191
Altercation with a suspect.

33:39.234 --> 33:42.194
An altercation? [chuckles]

33:42.237 --> 33:44.718
I'd call it a brutal assault.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.460
One your victim did
nothing to provoke.

33:47.503 --> 33:50.637
The guy shot and drowned dogs.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.205
So that gave you the right
to attack him?

33:53.248 --> 33:55.294
You did use

33:55.337 --> 33:58.601
excessive force
that day, did you not?

34:00.386 --> 34:02.214
Yes.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.172
RENFRO:
Do you have

34:04.216 --> 34:06.566
any remorse for what you did?

34:09.264 --> 34:11.049
No.

34:12.006 --> 34:14.139
RENFRO:
Agent Gibbs has a history

34:14.182 --> 34:16.228
of coloring outside the lines.

34:16.271 --> 34:20.101
And he has proven that he will
go to any lengths to ensure

34:20.145 --> 34:22.277
his version of justice

34:22.321 --> 34:24.105
is served.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.455
So, I'll simply ask--

34:26.499 --> 34:29.110
do you find it feasible

34:29.154 --> 34:33.419
that an agent
who's capable of assault

34:33.462 --> 34:35.943
could also be capable of...

34:35.986 --> 34:37.988
lying?

34:38.032 --> 34:39.686
Fabricating

34:39.729 --> 34:43.472
the defendant's
so-called confession?

34:43.516 --> 34:45.735
I am not asking you

34:45.779 --> 34:48.608
to choose sides,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:50.262 --> 34:55.049
But I am asking you
whether Agent Gibbs'

34:55.093 --> 34:57.312
recent behavior

34:57.356 --> 35:00.750
constitutes
reasonable doubt.

35:01.838 --> 35:04.667
I think you know
the answer is "yes."

35:04.711 --> 35:06.974
No more questions, Your Honor.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.513
[quiet coughing]

35:24.557 --> 35:26.515
Madam Foreperson,
have you reached a verdict?

35:26.559 --> 35:29.257
We have, Your Honor.

35:33.261 --> 35:36.569
On the eight counts of
securities fraud, what say you?

35:36.612 --> 35:38.527
FOREPERSON:
We, the jury,

35:38.571 --> 35:42.357
find the defendant,
Parker James, not guilty.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.533
No![whoops]

35:44.577 --> 35:45.578
[crying]

35:45.621 --> 35:47.493
Order! Order, please!

35:47.536 --> 35:50.017
[crying]:
You did this.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.888
PEREZ:
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:51.932 --> 35:53.586
thank you
for your service.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.196
Mr. James, you're free to go.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.676
Thank you, Judge.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.286
Your Honor, my client would
like his passport back.

35:58.330 --> 35:59.418
Today, please.

35:59.461 --> 36:00.593
So ordered.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.812
[gallery murmuring]

36:03.639 --> 36:06.468
Thank you, Mr. Gibbs.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.340
[chuckles softly]

36:08.383 --> 36:09.602
Why are you smiling?

36:09.645 --> 36:12.213
Oh, because I know
this isn't over.

36:12.257 --> 36:15.825
Really? 'Cause this feels
pretty over to me.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.876
Not guilty? Unbelievable.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.660
Verdict was unanimous.

36:24.704 --> 36:27.097
But how? James stole
all that money.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.709
No, he claims
that he invested all that money

36:29.752 --> 36:31.363
and then lost it
in the market.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.321
At least that's the story he
told when he was on the stand.

36:33.365 --> 36:36.977
And they believed him
over Gibbs? That's... insane.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.109
So Gibbs testified
for nothing?

36:39.153 --> 36:40.894
VANCE:
Gibbs made his choice,
Agent Torres.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.374
We all have to live with it.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.986
But we don't have to live with
Parker James being a free man.

36:46.029 --> 36:47.640
What do you got
on the two murders?

36:47.683 --> 36:49.424
[sighs]
A bunch of theories.

36:49.468 --> 36:52.210
We believe that the driver and
the shooter are the same person.

36:52.253 --> 36:55.038
We think, uh, James ordered
the hit from behind bars.

36:55.082 --> 36:58.825
So James orchestrated a second
crime to cover up his first,

36:58.868 --> 37:00.696
and now he's getting
away with both.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.132
What about the car?

37:02.176 --> 37:04.265
Kasie's searching every inch,
but so far,

37:04.309 --> 37:07.660
no prints, hair or any
physical evidence at all.

37:07.703 --> 37:10.228
What about electronic evidence?

37:11.403 --> 37:13.666
[elevator dings]McGEE:
Kasie.

37:13.709 --> 37:17.452
Don't worry, McGee. K-Hines
don't quit. I won't stop

37:17.496 --> 37:19.149
until...I think I know how
to find the driver.

37:19.193 --> 37:20.977
Oh, thank God.
Anything has to be better

37:21.021 --> 37:22.240
than more floor mat fibers.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.590
You have the keys?Come on, McGee.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.592
I dusted the keys twice already.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.681
They're clean.I'm not looking for prints.
Come on.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.335
Okay, where are we going?

37:30.378 --> 37:31.684
Cars like this--

37:31.727 --> 37:33.120
they have
infotainment systems, right?Mm-hmm.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.992
Navigation, satellite radio.

37:36.036 --> 37:38.081
Ah, and Bluetooth.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.040
Exactly. On a car
Delilah and I rented

37:40.083 --> 37:41.911
when we were in the Bahamas,
it automatically paired

37:41.955 --> 37:43.478
with my phone before
we had even left

37:43.522 --> 37:44.871
the parking lot.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.394
And you think this system
might have paired

37:46.438 --> 37:48.701
with the killer's phone?Yes, I do.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.704
Okay.

37:51.747 --> 37:55.142
Walter's the vehicle owner,
but who's Charlotte?

37:55.185 --> 37:57.840
Parker James' wife.

37:59.929 --> 38:01.148
Parker?

38:01.191 --> 38:02.976
What?A little help here?

38:03.019 --> 38:05.239
Geez. How many shoes
did you pack?

38:05.283 --> 38:06.371
All of them.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.460
[dog barking]

38:09.417 --> 38:10.679
CHARLOTTE:
Parker?

38:10.723 --> 38:12.159
PARKER:
How the hell
did they find us?

38:12.202 --> 38:13.900
Hey, McGee, check it out.

38:13.943 --> 38:16.468
I guess chivalry
isn't dead.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.383
Yeah, two people that can't
stand each other getting ready

38:18.426 --> 38:20.298
to take a road
trip together.

38:20.341 --> 38:21.516
What can I say?

38:21.560 --> 38:23.518
Love's a funny thing.
Right, babe?

38:23.562 --> 38:25.215
That's right, sweetie.

38:25.259 --> 38:28.349
Yeah, especially
when $30 million is involved.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.264
You guys don't have
anything on me.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.440
Otherwise, we wouldn't be
standing here talking.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.182
Let's go.TORRES:
No, you're right.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.879
You're right.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.186
But we have more than enough
to arrest your wifey over here.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.275
McGEE:The vehicle you used in
the hit-and-run paired

38:41.319 --> 38:43.930
with your cell phone, tracked
your every move that day.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.148
Oops.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.889
Parker, do something![handcuffs click]

38:46.933 --> 38:48.935
Keep quiet.
I'll get you a lawyer.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.459
Well, what about him?!

38:51.503 --> 38:53.113
He's free to go.Yeah.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.941
You might want to
say your goodbyes now because

38:54.984 --> 38:57.509
we both know that this
may be the last time you see

38:57.552 --> 38:58.640
or hear from him.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.033
Honey, I'll take care of this.

39:00.076 --> 39:00.990
TORRES:Oh, you're gonna
take care of it?

39:01.034 --> 39:01.991
Just like you took care of her

39:02.035 --> 39:04.124
last time you went away?

39:04.167 --> 39:05.647
You gonna
take the fall alone

39:05.691 --> 39:06.953
while he spends his millions?

39:06.996 --> 39:09.216
What millions?
I lost everything in the market.

39:09.259 --> 39:11.174
Really? 'Cause we thought
you traded it in

39:11.218 --> 39:13.394
for casino chips,
hid it in Macau.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.004
Parker.

39:15.048 --> 39:16.397
Charlotte,
they don't know anything.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.356
No. Wait.
No. Wait.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.054
Hey, cut-cut me a deal,
and-and I'll tell you

39:21.097 --> 39:23.404
exactly where
the chips are.Charlotte!

39:23.448 --> 39:24.927
[hisses]

39:24.971 --> 39:26.102
Damn.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.148
[clears throat]
Love is a funny thing.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.107
[handcuffs clicking]

39:33.458 --> 39:36.112
McGEE:
Charlotte admitted
to cutting a deal with James.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.766
If she agreed to
kill the accountant,

39:37.810 --> 39:39.725
he would split the
$30 million with her.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.422
Yeah, I don't think
that was in their vows.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.250
And the money?

39:43.293 --> 39:45.818
All the chips were stashed in
a safety-deposit box in Macau.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.428
That's where they were headed.

39:47.472 --> 39:50.083
Yeah, those chips have already
been converted back to cash,

39:50.126 --> 39:51.693
and the victims
reimbursed.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.696
Okay, so here's
the $64,000 question.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.916
How'd you find
the happy couple?

39:56.959 --> 39:58.439
Well, that's all Gibbs.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.746
Once Kasie told him her theory
about Macau,

40:00.789 --> 40:03.096
Gibbs figured James would
go there immediately.

40:03.139 --> 40:06.752
And Gibbs called me to get a
warrant to embed a GPS tracker.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.841
Embed it in where?

40:08.884 --> 40:11.452
James's passport.

40:11.496 --> 40:12.888
Ah.

40:15.282 --> 40:16.283
Nicely done.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.590
Good work, everybody.

40:18.633 --> 40:19.721
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:19.765 --> 40:21.549
Good night.Sir.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.770
So what do you think?
Should we call Gibbs?

40:24.813 --> 40:27.207
Invite him out
for a celebratory drink?

40:28.077 --> 40:29.644
Uh, you think
he would come?

40:29.688 --> 40:30.645
BISHOP:
Uh,

40:30.689 --> 40:32.560
well, there's only one way

40:32.604 --> 40:34.997
to find out.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.521
[news theme music plays]

40:36.564 --> 40:39.219
NEWSWOMAN: Parker James is
under arrest again.

40:39.262 --> 40:42.788
The disgraced financial advisor
and his estranged wife

40:42.831 --> 40:45.834
were taken into custody
by NCIS agents.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.662
Today's arrest marks
another twist

40:47.706 --> 40:50.622
in the wild saga of the
one-time Wall Street investor,
