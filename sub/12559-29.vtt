01:25.919 --> 01:29.287
VVE'LL BE MAKING CONTACT

01:51.695 --> 01:54.062
NOW, KOMMISSAR.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.775
THE FOX IS
IN THE TRAP.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.989
I COULD MAKE HIS HEAD

02:01.079 --> 02:03.992
LEAVE HIS BODY
FROM THIS DISTANCE.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.165
THAT WOULD GIVE YOU
PLEASURE, WOULDN'T IT?

02:07.252 --> 02:10.119
A GREAT DEAL
OF PLEASURE, KOMMISSAR.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.172
TELL ME WHEN.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.000
EVEN WHEN
HE LIES DOWN,

02:16.094 --> 02:18.301
I CAN STILL AIM
FOR HIS HEAD.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.806
YES, I BELIEVE IT, BORIS.

AWAY FOR A BIT.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.353

02:25.437 --> 02:27.303
OH, LAY IT ASIDE.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.314
WHAT, ARE WE NOT
GOING TO KILL HIM?

02:30.359 --> 02:32.316
[sighs]

02:32.361 --> 02:35.319
THE IMPATIENCE
OF THE BOURGEOIS.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.480
THEY DO NOT SIP WINE.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.909
THEY GULP IT DOWN
LIKE A SOFT DRINK.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.488
THEY DO NOT CARESS WOMEN.
THEY DEVOUR THEM.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.374
THEY DO NOT SNIFF AT THE
ESSENCE OF A RARE PERFUME. NO.

02:49.461 --> 02:53.329
THEY TRY TO JAM IT
INTO THEIR NOSTRILS.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.170
BORIS, THE GENTLEMAN
WILL DIE. INDEED, HE WILL.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.593
BUT I WANT HIM TO DIE
WITH FINESSE,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.923
WITH SUBTLETY AND
A DEGREE OF THOUGHT.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.850
<i>THAT IS A GOOD DEATH.</i>

03:06.937 --> 03:10.225
I DID NOT KNOW THERE
WAS A-A GOOD DEATH

03:10.315 --> 03:11.692
AND A BAD DEATH.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.565
UH-HUH.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.362
A GOOD DEATH IS
THE DEATH OF ART.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.866
A BAD ONE IS THE
DEATH OF A BUTCHER.

03:21.910 --> 03:26.450
YOU, BORIS, ARE A BUTCHER.
I AM AN ARTIST.

03:26.540 --> 03:31.205
YOU VVILL HA\/E YOUR DEATH TONIGHT,
BORIS, VVITHIN A FEVV HOURS,

03:31.253 --> 03:33.585
BUT WE WILL HAVE
KILLED WITH ARTISTRY

03:33.672 --> 03:36.539
AND NOT VVITH A MEAT CLEAVER
OR AN EXPLOSIVE BULLET

03:36.591 --> 03:38.719
OR ANY OTHER OF
THE BUTCHER'S TOOLS.

03:38.802 --> 03:43.467
NO, NO. THIS DEATH VVILL
BE LIKE A BALLET.

<i>(narrator) THE CAST OF

03:47.728 --> 03:50.720

<i>WHO MAY OR MAY NOT

03:53.692 --> 03:55.899
<i>BE IT BY BUTCHERY

03:57.446 --> 04:00.063
HIS NAME IS
MAJOR IVAN KUCHENKO.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.740
HE HAS, IF EVENTS GO
ACCORDING TO CERTAIN PLANS,

04:02.826 --> 04:05.568
PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR
MORE HOURS OF LIVING.

04:05.662 --> 04:09.155
BUT AN IGNORANCE SHARED BY BOTH
HIMSELF AND HIS EXECUTIONER

04:09.249 --> 04:12.992
IS OF THE FACT THAT BOTH OF
THEM HA\/E TAKEN A FIRST STEP

04:13.086 --> 04:14.918
INTO THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.269

<i>I'VE GOT MY

MAJOR KUCHENKO?

05:19.736 --> 05:21.477
AND YOU ARE?

05:21.571 --> 05:23.528
A FRIEND.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.574
MAY I COME IN?

05:32.624 --> 05:34.114
THANK YOU.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.260
YOU ARE THE ONE I SPOKE
TO ON THE TELEPHONE?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.552
MM-HM. WE HAD
A BRIEF CHAT EARLIER.

05:48.473 --> 05:52.216
WELL, WELL, IT'S QUITE
A PLACE YOU HAVE HERE.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.603
WHO OCCUPIED IT
BEFORE YOU?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.681
A RAT?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.861
I HAD NO LUXURY
OF CHOICES.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.939
NO, INDEED,
YOU HAVE NOT.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.112
IN THAT RESPECT, YOU ARE
A \/ERY POOR MAN, MAJOR.

06:06.199 --> 06:10.693
BUT, THEN AGAIN, YOU HA\/E A
BED, PICTURES ON THE VVALL,

06:10.745 --> 06:14.909
A CARPET.
SUCH AS IT IS.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.959
WELL, QUITE AN
ADEQUATE ACCOMMODATION.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.252
AH. AND A MOST
WONDERFUL VIEW

06:21.339 --> 06:23.376

06:23.425 --> 06:27.043
VVELL, MAJOR, THERE ARE VVORSE
PLACES TO SPEND AN EVENING IN.

INDEED. INDEED,
YOU HAVE.

06:36.980 --> 06:41.725
SIBERIA IS QUITE
COLD, ISN'T IT?

06:41.818 --> 06:46.312
I'VE BEEN TOLD IT HAS
A MOST UNFORTUNATE CLIMATE.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.113
YOU HAVE BEEN
TOLD RIGHT.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.328
IT IS A FREEZING JUNGLE.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.403
A FREEZING JUNGLE.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.949
OH, THAT'S MARVELOUS.
LOVELY IMAGERY.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.660
SIBERIA AS
A FREEZING JUNGLE.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.089
YOU MAKE REFERENCE,
OF COURSE, TO THE PEOPLE.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.296
I MAKE REFERENCE
TO SOME PEOPLE.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.969
OH.

07:11.056 --> 07:15.971
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
UNPLEASANT FOR YOU.

07:16.061 --> 07:20.601
SUFFIOIENTLY UNPLEASANT TO MOTl\/ATE
YOU TO RENOUNCE YOUR NATIVE COUNTRY

07:20.649 --> 07:23.516
AND TO TRY AND SEEK
ASYLUM ELSEWHERE,

07:23.610 --> 07:25.942

UP TO DATE.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.105
YOU WERE
A POLITICAL PRISONER.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.612
YOU ESCAPED. YOU SERVED
A TERM OF 12 YEARS,

07:32.661 --> 07:35.028
AND NOW YOU ARRIVED HERE
IN A NEUTRAL COUNTRY,

07:35.121 --> 07:37.613
AND YOU ARE <i>DESPERA</i> TELY
TRYING TO GET AN AIRCRAFT

07:37.707 --> 07:40.665
TO TAKE YOU OUT OF HERE
TO A WESTERN NATION.

07:40.752 --> 07:46.373
BUT, UH, YOU FEEL YOU
ARE UNDER SURVEILLANCE?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.634
I KNOW I AM UNDER
SURVEILLANCE.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.461
WELL, DO YOU
KNOW BY WHOM?

07:52.514 --> 07:54.471
VERY WELL.

07:54.557 --> 07:58.050
WELL, TELL ME.
WHO ARE THEY?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.761
LOOK IN THE
MIRROR, KOMMISSAR.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.352
DISCERNING, MAJOR.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.065
YOU REMEMBER FACES.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.900
I REMEMBER PAIN.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.487
I REMEMBER SOME
INTERROGATIONS

08:18.581 --> 08:21.243
THAT WENT ON
FOR MANY MONTHS.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.746
I REMEMBER ONE
PARTICULAR MAN

08:23.837 --> 08:26.420
WHO SMOKED A LONG
CIGARETTE IN A HOLDER,

08:26.506 --> 08:29.498
STOOD IN A CORNER,
NODDING AND SMILING

08:29.551 --> 08:32.339
WHILE I WENT FROM
AGONY TO AGONY.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.214
SO, MAJOR,

08:36.307 --> 08:38.389
MAY WE DISPENSE
WITH THE AMENITIES,

08:38.476 --> 08:41.342
THE MASQUERADES,
THE LITTLE GIVE AND TAKE

08:41.395 --> 08:44.559
BETWEEN TWO STRANGERS
FEELING EACH OTHER OUT?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.399
NOW WE GET
TO THE POINT.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.031
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
WE WOULD PERMIT YOU

08:58.121 --> 09:02.536
TO BOOK PASSAGE ON AN AIRCRAFT
OUT OF HERE? IMPOSSIBLE.

09:02.584 --> 09:06.202
<i>AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE MIL/TAR)',

09:10.216 --> 09:12.378

RELEASED ELSEWHERE.

09:12.427 --> 09:17.297
SO, IT'S NOT REALLY TO OUR
ADVANTAGE THAT YOU LEA\/E HERE.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.724
OF COURSE, IT VVOULD BE
SIMPLER AND MORE CONVENIENT

09:20.769 --> 09:23.181
TO ACCOMPANY ME
BACK TO OUR EMBASSY.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.973
I AM SICK,

09:28.068 --> 09:32.232
TIRED AND TORN, KOMMISSAR,
BUT I AM NOT INSANE.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.238
I VVOULD SOONER CUT MY VVRISTS
OVER A SINK AND BLEED TO DEATH!

09:35.325 --> 09:37.566
NO, MAJOR.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.408
I AM AFRAID VVE ARE OF TVVO
MINDS ABOUT THAT KIND OF DEATH.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.331
GENTLY, GENTLY, MAJOR.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.413
HERE. I BROUGHT
SOME AMONTILLADO.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.925
QUITE RARE AND MOST
PLEA-SING TO THE PALATE.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.431
I'M AFRAID I VVILL HA\/E TO REPEAT
VVHAT I SAID BEFORE, KOMMISSAR.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.763

OF VVHAT VVILL HAPPEN TO ME

10:03.853 --> 10:06.595
<i>IF I WERE TO DRINK
ANY OF THAT.</i>

10:06.648 --> 10:11.939
VVITH YOUR INDULGENOE, MAJOR, IF YOU ASSUME
THIS TO CONTAIN OYANIDE OR SOME OTHER POISON,

10:12.028 --> 10:15.441
YOU'RE QUITE
WRONG. YOU SEE,

10:15.532 --> 10:19.947
I DON'T SHARE
YOUR DEATH WISH.

10:19.994 --> 10:24.204
I'M QUITE A HEALTHY MAN VVITH EXCELLENT
EXPECTATIONS AS TO MY LONGEVITY.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.033
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I VVAS
ONLY PROPOSING A SOCIAL DRINK

BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.581
/WILL DRINK FIRST.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.129
SUCH A RITUAL.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.882

10:39.973 --> 10:43.056
KOMMISSAR, YOU HAVE
ONLY ONE PURPOSE WITH ME.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.635
WHY DON'T YOU TRY

10:45.728 --> 10:49.392
IF YOU VVANT TO DISARM
ME TO GET RID OF THIS',

10:49.482 --> 10:52.315
IT WILL TAKE MORE
THAN A SOCIAL WINE.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.985
YES, INDEED.

AS TO MY BUSINESS VVITH YOU,

I CAN TELL YOU

11:08.585 --> 11:12.874
I HAVE KILLED

VERY WELL TRY.

SOMETHING ABOUT US.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.241

12:43.554 --> 12:45.682
I DON'T HAVE
A VERY LARGE SALARY,

12:45.765 --> 12:49.599

12:57.777 --> 13:01.862
<i>IN YOUR CASE,
I CHOOSE TO PROLONG IT.</i>

13:01.948 --> 13:04.189
<i>AND IN THE PROCESS
OF THIS PROLONGATION,</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:08.118
I HA\/E COME UP VVITH, VVITH
SOMETHING THAT I THINK

13:08.162 --> 13:12.872

METHOD OF EXECUTION.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.619
<i>ONE DESIGNED TO CHALLENGE

VVHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS THAT I'M REASONABLY SURE

17:59.495 --> 18:02.328
HE'LL FIND IT, BUT HE'LL
FIND IT WHEN IT'S TOO LATE.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.633
[Yawns]

18:23.728 --> 18:25.639
IS HE AT THE TABLE?

18:25.730 --> 18:27.687
