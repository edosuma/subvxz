WEBVTT

00:10.200 --> 00:11.679
What the fuck is going on?

00:11.680 --> 00:14.039
It's my auntie.
Who d'you think it is?

00:14.040 --> 00:15.479
You've got a twin brother?

00:15.480 --> 00:16.959
Nowt's getting past you!

00:16.960 --> 00:20.599
Oh, my God.
You fancy him, don't you?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.999
Has this got something to do with
the dead girl at the cemetery?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.279
How d'you know about her?

00:24.280 --> 00:25.159
Who is she?

00:25.160 --> 00:27.599
She was my girlfriend.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.199
She died. Drugs overdose.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.479
Me and you fought the Nazis
and I died?

00:33.480 --> 00:36.039
'You kissed me
when you gave me the power.'

00:36.040 --> 00:37.079
And how was that?

00:37.080 --> 00:41.079
Yeah, it was all right.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.679
Big news. You're going to be doing
some gardening.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.759
Gardening?

01:19.760 --> 01:23.039
Uh, I had a call from
this guy at Wertham General.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.999
He's got some weeds need weeding,
plants need planting.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.919
I said, "Yes, mate.
I'll put my top people right on it."

01:29.920 --> 01:32.319
I'd got myself geared up
for dog-shit, here.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.319
I thought we were doing
dog-shit, man.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.119
It's... it's fine.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.119
Tools are in the storeroom,
the hospital's that way.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.679
Fucking gardening.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.199
What's he doing here?

01:59.200 --> 02:02.199
Do you think he's here
to take our powers?

02:02.200 --> 02:06.199
It's the law of the jungle,
kill or be killed.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.399
Hi.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.399
You motherfucker. What's that?

02:17.840 --> 02:20.999
Ha-ha! No, no, I'm sorry. I am so
sorry. I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.079
I've made a mistake,
I've made... Argh!

02:23.080 --> 02:25.719
Sorry. He's got me.
Help me or he's going to break it.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.719
What the fuck are you doing?
Why are you here?

02:30.040 --> 02:32.999
Er...

02:33.000 --> 02:36.999
Erm...

02:37.760 --> 02:41.759
I just came to see
if you want to go for a drink.

02:44.405 --> 02:46.705
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd, MemoryOnSmells</font>

03:30.440 --> 03:32.279
Are you OK?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.439
Yeah.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.439
I thought that went really well.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.999
So, did you want to go
for that drink like a date?

03:44.160 --> 03:47.079
Yeah.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.239
Good.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.239
I was thinking,
bar on the estate, half seven?

03:55.920 --> 03:59.919
Wow, the bar on the estate.
Classy!

04:02.560 --> 04:06.559
All right then. I'll see you later.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.399
What about Shannon?

04:14.840 --> 04:18.839
You were right.
She's not coming back.

04:28.280 --> 04:32.279
I wonder what happens when he, er...
when he shags you.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.799
Do you reckon he takes your powers?

04:35.800 --> 04:39.199
Maybe that's it, right?

04:39.200 --> 04:43.199
Maybe he gets his kicks from just
going around, shagging girls

04:43.440 --> 04:45.679
and stealing their powers. Hmm?

04:45.680 --> 04:46.799
Why would he do that?

04:46.800 --> 04:47.839
Well, I don't know,

04:47.840 --> 04:51.839
why does Richard Saunders film
himself crapping out of trees?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.679
Who's Richard Saunders?

04:54.680 --> 04:58.679
A friend. Just promise me one thing,
you'll make him wear a condom.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.799
Can you just shut up about him?

05:00.800 --> 05:04.799
Better still, make him wear two.
Double-bag it!

05:18.920 --> 05:21.319
I need to get some bread.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.119
I went to make some toast
this morning, it was all mouldy.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.879
We're out of cereal as well.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.719
I'll stop somewhere on the way home.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.719
Maybe just get a takeaway.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.799
I can't do this. I just can't
see you like this any more.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.239
I loved you so much.

05:53.960 --> 05:57.959
Goodbye, Jen.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.559
Are you all right?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.999
Do you want me to get someone?

07:59.520 --> 08:03.519
Hey.

08:04.040 --> 08:08.039
I know you can hear me.
And I just want to say sorry.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.359
I have to do this.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.319
I have to get back to him.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.719
I used to hate it,
how dark they kept it in here.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.359
Hey, that walk to the hospital,
man, it took ages.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.119
Really, that's interesting!

08:56.120 --> 08:58.199
There's an anger management
counsellor here for you.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.239
For me?

08:59.240 --> 09:02.039
Yeah. It's all part of your
"ongoing rehabilitation".

09:02.040 --> 09:03.279
Did you have the last Twix?

09:03.280 --> 09:06.039
Yes.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.039
She's waiting for you in my office.
Enjoy.

09:10.520 --> 09:14.239
For fuck's sake.
It wasn't even me, it was him.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.279
Who?

09:15.280 --> 09:19.279
Who do you think? This whiny little
prick in here. The other me.

09:20.640 --> 09:24.399
I was seeing this girl, right.
Nice girl, Dutch-Irish.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.159
Had a webbed foot. Left foot, fine.
Right foot, just a little bit creepy.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.319
Might have been the other way around.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.039
Anyway, so we have this big row,
we end up breaking up.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.959
Honestly, I weren't that bothered.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.799
Cos there's plenty more fish
in the sea and all that.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.799
She couldn't wear flip-flops. Because
of the web, she had no toe-groove.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.679
Anyway, so we split up.
You know, she's really angry,

09:45.680 --> 09:48.999
starts running her mouth off,
all gets a little bit personal.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.039
Honestly, dude, I were fine with it,
mate. Not him.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.039
He starts getting himself
all upset, ends up trashing her car,

09:57.440 --> 09:59.639
she rang the police.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.919
Boom.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.919
So that's why you're
on community service?

10:05.920 --> 10:09.919
Yes! Yes. He did it, I took the rap.
I'm totally innocent.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.599
Mmm. Yes.
We should write a campaign song.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.239
Do some wristbands.

10:19.240 --> 10:23.239
You, you're very clever,
aren't you, eh?

10:27.960 --> 10:31.719
So, my name's Clare Bradman,
I'm a behavioural therapist

10:31.720 --> 10:34.279
and I specialise in issues
around anger management.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.719
Firstly, I don't want you to feel
intimidated, you're not on trial.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.919
All we do is we just sit here
and we talk.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.079
We "talk"?

10:42.080 --> 10:44.279
You sound surprised?

10:44.280 --> 10:46.599
Well, yeah, because
it's anger management.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.519
I... I don't know, I thought
we'd be smashing some stuff up

10:49.520 --> 10:51.359
or putting some boxing gloves on,

10:51.360 --> 10:55.199
taking turns beating the shit out
of each other. Do we not?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.879
We don't do that, do we?

10:56.880 --> 10:58.359
I'm afraid not.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.359
Yeah, well, I'm going to have to be
honest with you, Clare,

11:01.360 --> 11:05.359
when I say... that I'm disappointed.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.039
Why don't we make a start?

11:08.040 --> 11:09.079
Mmm?

11:09.080 --> 11:12.479
Yeah.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.639
Hi.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.479
Hello?

11:23.480 --> 11:26.959
You probably don't remember me.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.959
I was a friend of Jen's.
We were at school together.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.639
Right.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.479
Can I come in?

11:35.480 --> 11:39.479
Er, yeah. Sure.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.799
Shall we talk some more about
the incident with the car?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.319
Yeah, if you want.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.679
What was it, do you think,
that made you react the way you did?

11:50.680 --> 11:54.279
I honestly don't know.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.079
It were a full moon. I tend to go
a bit mental on a full moon.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.679
I'm like half-wolf.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.679
I do have exceptionally hairy balls,
so...

12:05.840 --> 12:07.759
Can I ask you something?

12:07.760 --> 12:08.879
Mmm.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.879
Did you wet the bed as a child?

12:14.640 --> 12:16.399
N-No.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.879
It's often linked to
anger issues in adults.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.039
There's no shame in it.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.439
Where do you get this stuff from?
Cos it's...

12:22.440 --> 12:26.039
I've dealt with individuals
who've wet the bed
well into their late teens.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.839
I know it can be very traumatic...

12:28.400 --> 12:29.439
as a child,

12:29.440 --> 12:31.479
to have to go through all that
on your own.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.479
Yeah, can it? Just... give me
a minute, cos I've got, er...

12:35.800 --> 12:39.799
Things I just need to... Nice one.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.119
This is such bullshit.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.839
She's onto you. I think she knows.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.839
She doesn't know anything.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.359
She knows you're a bedwetter.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.879
I'm not a bedwetter!
I haven't done that in years.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.519
Haven't you?

12:51.520 --> 12:55.039
Now, listen, that was one time.
And I was drunk. Right?

12:55.040 --> 12:58.119
And everybody does that anyway,
so it's different.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.159
We should go back in.
She's making some good points, man.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.759
No, I'm not having you in here.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.399
You're popping out every time
she gets personal.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.399
You can wait for me outside.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.879
No, fine.
That's absolutely fine by me.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.759
I was only trying to...

13:20.760 --> 13:24.759
If that's how you feel.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.959
Are you OK?
Do you want to talk about it?

13:41.440 --> 13:44.999
I've been lucky.
Everyone's been really supportive.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.239
Bringing me food,
making sure I'm OK.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.839
Sorry, it's really weird.
Jen used to do that.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.119
Actually, do you mind
if we do this another time?

14:06.120 --> 14:10.119
I'm having a bit of a shit day.

14:12.640 --> 14:16.639
Dom. It's OK.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.719
Everything's going to be OK.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.359
It's me.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.199
It's Jen. I'm Jen. In here.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.999
What the fuck are you talking about?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.879
What do you want to know?

14:38.880 --> 14:42.399
Our first date?

14:42.400 --> 14:44.159
We went to your cousin's house party

14:44.160 --> 14:46.239
and we had this disgusting
cherry vodka

14:46.240 --> 14:47.799
and I was sick on your trainers,

14:47.800 --> 14:51.599
and they were new, and
they were grey with red, red bits...

14:51.600 --> 14:55.279
and we moved in here and I dropped
the TV and you shouted at me

14:55.280 --> 14:58.239
and it still has all these
weird lines across the screen.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.959
Everything you told me
at the hospital, about...

15:00.960 --> 15:04.719
about your phone getting stolen,
about your dad breaking his finger.

15:04.720 --> 15:08.719
And this morning, you told me
about the bread going mouldy.

15:09.320 --> 15:13.319
I heard it, I heard everything, Dom.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.079
Jen?

15:29.880 --> 15:31.239
Have you seen Kelly?

15:31.240 --> 15:35.239
Not since this morning.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.799
I guess you've been stood up.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.439
'Hi, it's Kelly. I'm not about,
leave me a message.'

15:50.480 --> 15:51.919
I'm in the bar. Where are you?

15:51.920 --> 15:55.919
If you're not into me,
just tell me, yeah?

16:16.200 --> 16:16.439
You moved the sofa?

16:16.440 --> 16:19.719
I just shifted some stuff around.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.159
Flat screen TV?

16:21.160 --> 16:24.679
Yeah, got it a couple of months ago.

16:24.680 --> 16:25.679
It looks nice.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.599
Cheers.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.599
So much better in here.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.919
This is so fucked up.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.919
Yeah, pretty fucked up.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.239
We should get a takeaway.

16:43.240 --> 16:47.119
How about a Chinese?

16:47.120 --> 16:48.399
Yeah, OK.

16:48.400 --> 16:52.399
Cool, I'll just go and get changed.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.639
I know this is weird,

18:10.640 --> 18:12.079
but this is the only way
we can be together.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.519
Yeah, I know.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.519
I am happy.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.359
I'm going to order that Chinese.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.359
I need to eat something that doesn't
come through a tube.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.279
Oh...

18:38.600 --> 18:40.839
Right, has anyone seen
the other me?

18:40.840 --> 18:42.919
He didn't come home last night,
you know.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.159
No, sorry.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.159
It's fine. I just feel weird
when he's not inside me.
Do you know what I mean?

18:49.880 --> 18:53.679
Not that kind of
"inside me." Don't do that.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.119
Kelly's not here either.

18:56.120 --> 19:00.119
Shit. You know what this means,
don't you, right?

19:00.720 --> 19:04.079
Kelly and the other me,
they're fucking.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.519
She didn't show up for
her date last night.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.159
Right. You lot can fuck off
back to the hospital.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.479
Except you.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.839
Your shrink's here.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.959
Again?

19:14.960 --> 19:17.999
Oh, hold up. Where's the other one?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.999
Oh, she just phoned me.
She's not well.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.999
She's got period pains.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.959
Bad ones.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.239
Don't you hate it
when that happens?

19:29.240 --> 19:32.159
You know,
when you get the really bad ones?

19:32.160 --> 19:34.639
Terrible.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.999
Well...

19:36.000 --> 19:39.999
that's her in the shit.

19:41.200 --> 19:45.199
Brilliant.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.639
Dom?

20:37.080 --> 20:39.319
So...

20:39.320 --> 20:41.599
Here we are again.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.919
I was thinking...

20:44.920 --> 20:47.879
For today's session,

20:47.880 --> 20:50.999
if it's OK with you...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.519
we could, um,

20:53.520 --> 20:57.519
pick up where we left off.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.079
That's interesting.

21:03.080 --> 21:07.079
That's... Oh!

21:18.480 --> 21:19.919
Hang... hang on.

21:24.040 --> 21:27.159
It's nothing.
Carry on, it's all right.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.479
Oh, therapy...

21:29.480 --> 21:33.479
I love it!

21:40.840 --> 21:44.839
All right?

21:46.480 --> 21:48.359
Were you wanking?

21:48.360 --> 21:52.359
No!

21:53.560 --> 21:55.239
So what if I was?

21:55.240 --> 21:59.239
You're wanking,
on your own, in a cupboard?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.759
We used to do it.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.159
Yeah, and it was weird then.

22:03.160 --> 22:07.159
I never heard you complaining.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.919
What's going on?

22:13.280 --> 22:15.159
Have you been wanking?

22:15.160 --> 22:19.159
Do you want to say it a bit louder?

22:21.240 --> 22:22.839
What?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.519
Why are you here?

22:24.520 --> 22:27.999
What, you think
I was watching him wank?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.159
That's what you used to do.

22:30.160 --> 22:34.159
I'm not getting into this.
It's too weird.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.639
Hey! Come here!

22:46.640 --> 22:49.719
Oh, let me tell you something,
right,

22:49.720 --> 22:53.719
she is one amazing therapist.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.639
I can't believe the council
actually pay for that kind of thing.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.679
And I tell you something else,
if I could be bothered,

23:00.680 --> 23:04.439
I would write a letter to Social
Services and just congratulate them.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.159
Seriously.

23:05.160 --> 23:09.159
Move.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.039
Where have you been?

23:19.040 --> 23:20.479
Nowhere.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.799
What's that?

23:21.800 --> 23:22.839
It's nothing.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.039
What is that?

23:24.040 --> 23:26.199
Is that a love...

23:26.200 --> 23:30.199
Ugh! It's a love bite!
What are you, a 12-year-old girl?

23:31.840 --> 23:33.679
You are fucking Kelly! I knew it.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.039
No, it's not Kelly.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.719
It's Clare.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.759
The therapist?!

23:39.760 --> 23:40.319
Yeah.

23:40.320 --> 23:44.079
Hang on, that explains a few things,
does that.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.039
What do you mean?

23:46.040 --> 23:47.839
Your fuck-buddy has just
wanked me off.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.079
What?!

23:49.080 --> 23:52.439
Yeah, I know! She just whipped it
out and starts plugging away on it

23:52.440 --> 23:53.439
like she's trying to break it.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.799
Why didn't you stop her?

23:54.800 --> 23:57.639
Why would I do that? Eh?
God, she's intense though, man.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.559
Did she do all that crying
straight after?

24:00.560 --> 24:02.599
Like crying, immediately afterwards.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.999
I can't believe this.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.519
I've just shot my load,
she starts getting all heavy, like,

24:08.520 --> 24:11.119
"I shouldn't be doing this,
I'm a total mess."

24:11.120 --> 24:13.239
At one point,
I was honestly considering

24:13.240 --> 24:16.799
shoving my cock into her mouth
just to shut her up, mate.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.799
Oi! Now you stop it! You don't
talk about my girlfriend like that.

24:22.480 --> 24:26.119
No! No!
You're not going out with her, man.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.839
She's better than some of the skanky
horrible sluts you end up with.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.839
She's old and she's a psycho and she
cries after she's wanked people off.

24:34.280 --> 24:38.279
She cries because she cares.
Unlike you.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.919
No, you listen.
You don't get to choose. I choose.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.919
And that's how this thing works,
right?

24:42.920 --> 24:46.119
You get back in here, because
I'm not having people thinking

24:46.120 --> 24:47.839
I'm fucking a 40-year-old woman.

24:47.840 --> 24:51.839
No. I love her.

24:52.120 --> 24:56.119
And I don't care what you think.

24:56.120 --> 25:00.119
Don't you walk out of this room.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.159
Kelly?

25:12.160 --> 25:16.159
Kelly!

25:19.920 --> 25:22.679
What are you doing?

25:22.680 --> 25:23.999
I just wanted to come.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.599
Why?

25:25.600 --> 25:27.359
I don't know.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.439
I'm not in there any more.
I'm right here.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.719
So who is in there?

25:31.720 --> 25:33.719
I don't know.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.719
I've no idea.
Look, it just happened.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.239
I was lying there,
she came in and we swapped.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.159
That's not right, Jen.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.919
So what? You care more about
a girl you've never met?

25:44.920 --> 25:45.599
No, of course I don't.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.999
Well, come on then.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.239
Do you have any idea
how sick I am of this room?

25:49.240 --> 25:50.599
Who is she, Jen?

25:50.600 --> 25:54.039
Just forget about her.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.959
I don't think I can.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.759
OK, then.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.559
What are you doing?

26:01.560 --> 26:05.199
Turning her off. You'll have no
choice. You'll have to be with me.

26:05.200 --> 26:09.199
You're not Jen.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.039
You've changed.
I don't know who you are any more.

26:12.040 --> 26:15.199
Dom, wait!

26:15.200 --> 26:16.319
Look Dom, I didn't plan any of this.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.279
Get off me.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.399
Dom, please don't go!

26:21.400 --> 26:23.079
I came back to you.

26:23.080 --> 26:27.079
Yeah? Well, I don't want you.
I don't want you like this.

26:30.280 --> 26:34.119
Get off her!

26:34.120 --> 26:36.879
Are you OK?

26:36.880 --> 26:37.679
I think you should leave.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.359
Yeah, so do I.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.642
Kelly? Come on, let's go.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.799
Hello.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.959
Hiya. Just to let you know, I've
been having a think about us...

27:04.960 --> 27:08.439
Yeah, it's not going to happen.
Right? I mean, listen,

27:08.440 --> 27:10.879
thanks for the hand job
and the sex and all that.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.319
Brilliant. But you are...

27:13.320 --> 27:17.319
you're quite old and you cry,
a lot. Hmm?

27:21.200 --> 27:25.199
Bye, then.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.759
Who was the guy at the hospital?

27:40.760 --> 27:44.759
Oh, I don't want to talk about it.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.399
You should get changed before
the probation worker gets back.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.759
Where were you last night?

28:08.760 --> 28:11.839
Kelly, what happened?
You didn't even text me.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.119
I was busy.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.959
That's the best
you can come up with?

28:14.960 --> 28:18.959
Will you just fuck off
and stop following me?

28:30.240 --> 28:31.679
Hiya.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.719
What?

28:32.720 --> 28:35.879
I've... I've booked a table.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.719
Do you like Italian food?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.919
Are you taking the piss?

28:39.920 --> 28:43.519
No. I'm not taking...
taking the piss?

28:43.520 --> 28:46.319
Prick!

28:46.320 --> 28:47.519
Aaarghh!

28:47.520 --> 28:51.359
Guys, guys?

28:51.360 --> 28:52.999
What's going on with Kelly?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.559
How do you mean?

28:54.560 --> 28:57.759
Well, she won't talk to me.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.639
Can someone tell me what's going on?

29:01.640 --> 29:03.359
Well, there was this guy.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.679
She's seeing someone else?

29:04.680 --> 29:08.159
No. This guy in the hospital.
She had a fight with him.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.279
Why?

29:09.280 --> 29:12.119
I don't know.
She won't talk about it.

29:12.120 --> 29:14.039
Right, well we need to find her.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.119
Do the power thing,
find out where she is.

29:17.120 --> 29:21.119
OK.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.959
Dr Jones is on her way.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.239
What? What is it?

29:38.240 --> 29:42.239
Well, she's in the hospital.
I think it's serious.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.559
Dom!

29:56.440 --> 30:00.439
Check again. Kelly Bailey,
five foot five, medium build.

30:01.520 --> 30:05.319
Wears her hair pulled back,
like, all the way back, like that.

30:05.320 --> 30:09.239
Sorry.
It's not coming up with anything.

30:09.240 --> 30:13.239
That's the woman I saw. That way.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.079
This is the room.

30:26.080 --> 30:30.079
OK. That's not Kelly.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.319
No, she is sexy though, hmm!

30:33.320 --> 30:37.319
For a coma victim, she is.

30:37.480 --> 30:41.479
Do it again.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.879
It's her. She's in there.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.079
Who is?

30:53.080 --> 30:56.159
Kelly. That's Kelly.

30:56.160 --> 31:00.159
It's a body-swap.
They must've switched places.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.599
Oh, my God.

31:04.600 --> 31:08.599
This is like that film
with Nicolas Cage in.

31:09.760 --> 31:10.999
Face/Off.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.999
Face/Off wasn't a body-swap. They
had surgery to look like each other.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.079
Oh.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.359
This is more like Freaky Friday.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.999
Who gives a shit?
What are we going to do about Kelly?

31:23.000 --> 31:26.759
All right, come on. Come on.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.519
Why don't you check this out?

31:28.520 --> 31:31.439
Wake up! Wake up!

31:31.440 --> 31:32.839
Wake, wake up!

31:32.840 --> 31:34.399
What are you doing?

31:34.400 --> 31:36.319
I'm waking her up.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.359
Don't you think they tried that?

31:38.360 --> 31:40.319
Maybe they hadn't thought of it.

31:40.320 --> 31:44.319
Wake up! You're faking it,
we all know it.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.879
Oh. I didn't know she had visitors.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.159
Are you family?

31:49.160 --> 31:53.159
I'm her brother.

31:53.920 --> 31:57.919
Could I have a word?

31:59.120 --> 32:00.759
Dick head!

32:00.760 --> 32:02.199
Oooh, eh!

32:02.200 --> 32:03.919
I've just spoken to your mother.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.119
I don't know if she's told you yet,

32:06.120 --> 32:10.119
she's made the decision to turn
Jen's ventilator off.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.999
You may want to say goodbye.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.679
No, you can't do that.

32:15.680 --> 32:19.679
I'm sorry.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.039
They're shutting her down.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.559
What?

32:27.560 --> 32:29.599
They're turning off her life
support.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.999
We need to steal the body.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.039
Oh!

32:32.040 --> 32:33.199
What are you saying?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.319
If she dies, Kelly dies.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.599
Let's pack her up.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.519
Where will we take her?

32:37.520 --> 32:39.119
The Community Centre.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.279
The Community Centre. Brilliant.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.239
That is the perfect place
to take a girl in a coma, innit?

32:44.240 --> 32:48.239
You take the beepy thing, the
breathing thing and the piss-bag.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.559
Hiya, hello,
I'm just visiting my granddad,

32:53.560 --> 32:55.799
and I'm pretty sure
he's prolapsed his anus.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.719
I mean, I'm not an expert,
but it's looking that way.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.839
Could you just come
and have a look for me?

33:00.840 --> 33:03.919
Nice one, cheers. He's just
down here, he's in a terrible way.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.279
Really painful for him.

33:05.280 --> 33:09.279
Just prod him in the stomach
or something. Just there.

33:25.560 --> 33:29.559
Oh, sh...!

33:47.520 --> 33:51.199
Come on.

33:53.080 --> 33:57.079
Shit!

34:01.760 --> 34:05.759
Grab her hand.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.759
Can you just hurry up, yeah?

34:15.440 --> 34:19.438
Hey! Wait!

34:20.320 --> 34:22.279
Come on. Get in the front!

34:22.280 --> 34:26.279
Quickly!

34:30.440 --> 34:34.438
You all right?

34:40.360 --> 34:42.159
Kell?

34:42.159 --> 34:46.159
Kelly?

34:47.280 --> 34:50.839
What are you doing?

34:50.840 --> 34:54.399
I've lost him.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.399
I've lost everything.

34:58.480 --> 35:02.479
I know exactly how you feel.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.719
Come on, move, man!

35:23.880 --> 35:26.679
Oh, well I feel
like I should be helping!

35:26.680 --> 35:28.399
Call the other Kelly.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.839
We need her to get here
and make her swap back.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.719
Right, I'm on it.

35:32.720 --> 35:36.719
She was my first, Clare.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.519
I never really done it
without him before, you know.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.719
By meself, just me.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.719
Afterwards, she just lay on me.
We were there for ages.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.559
He just sleeps with people,

35:52.560 --> 35:56.559
he's out of there before he's
had time to take his condom off.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.679
I'm never going to find anyone,
am I?

36:03.440 --> 36:04.919
Do you want another one?

36:04.920 --> 36:08.919
Yeah.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.599
Hello?

36:14.600 --> 36:15.719
'Hello?'

36:15.720 --> 36:17.199
What have you said to Clare?

36:17.200 --> 36:19.679
What are you doing on Kelly's phone?

36:19.680 --> 36:20.999
'Where are you now?'

36:21.000 --> 36:22.399
I'm out. With Kelly.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.799
No, that's not Kelly.

36:23.800 --> 36:27.799
'Kelly's in a coma,
there's someone else inside her.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.119
'You need to get her back
to the Community Centre right now,

36:31.120 --> 36:40.999
'or the real Kelly's going to die.'

36:45.040 --> 36:47.279
We need to get away,
we need to get some fresh air.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.599
What about the seaside?

36:48.600 --> 36:51.639
Cos that always really cheers
me up, like a nice donkey ride.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.599
Eh, that's the probation
worker's car.

36:54.600 --> 36:58.359
I can drive us down there,
come on. Keys are down here.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.319
We could get some fish and chips.
Do you like fish and chips?

37:01.320 --> 37:05.319
Course you do. It's just in here.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.359
The keys are in there.

37:39.880 --> 37:43.879
No. You can't make
me go back in there.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.719
Why is there a girl in
a coma in the store room?

37:49.720 --> 37:53.719
Hey, you're going nowhere.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.159
We were supposed to be going
out for a drink together.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.159
Me and Kelly.

38:25.160 --> 38:29.159
It could've been nothing. Maybe she
would've been too high maintenance,

38:29.480 --> 38:33.479
maybe I would've got on her nerves.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.519
But what if she liked me?

38:37.520 --> 38:39.399
What if we were good together?

38:39.400 --> 38:42.479
We were good together. Me and Dom.

38:42.480 --> 38:46.319
What, the guy from the hospital?

38:46.320 --> 38:48.679
I thought I could make it work.

38:48.680 --> 38:52.679
I was wrong.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.799
He doesn't love me any more.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.799
Not like this.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.799
That is not you.

39:07.880 --> 39:11.879
I just don't want to
be this person any more.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.879
You've called an ambulance, yeah?

39:18.880 --> 39:20.999
We should call an ambulance.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.399
We can't. They'll think
it's Kelly, they'll arrest her.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.999
It weren't Kelly though, were it?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.439
Yeah, well, try explaining that.

39:27.440 --> 39:31.439
Why did she stab me?

39:31.600 --> 39:35.599
What did I ever do to her?

39:40.880 --> 39:44.639
That wasn't Kelly.
She swapped bodies.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.519
What?

39:46.520 --> 39:48.199
We've kind of got these powers.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.959
We're like superheroes.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.679
Show him.

39:54.680 --> 39:58.679
Come on.

40:00.920 --> 40:04.919
What the fuck?

40:06.720 --> 40:07.999
You'll be fine.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.999
I can't believe I never
picked up on it.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.959
You bunch of dicks.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.959
Fucking superheroes?

41:01.280 --> 41:03.839
You have to promise me.

41:03.840 --> 41:07.839
If I go back in there,
find Dom and bring him here.

41:10.640 --> 41:14.639
I want him to see me
one last time, like I was.

41:18.200 --> 41:22.199
Don't let him leave me like that.

41:23.240 --> 41:26.359
You can't leave me in there.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.559
Do you understand?

41:28.560 --> 41:32.559
I understand.

41:57.160 --> 42:01.159
Kelly?

42:03.080 --> 42:07.079
You OK?

42:07.440 --> 42:11.439
Come on.

42:44.640 --> 42:48.639
It's what she wanted.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.959
It's good to see you again.

43:01.960 --> 43:05.959
I've missed you.

43:08.480 --> 43:12.479
Goodbye, Jen.

43:50.240 --> 43:54.239
So does this make the Power
Guy one of the gang now?

43:55.600 --> 43:58.879
Cos I don't know how
I feel about that, you know.

43:58.880 --> 44:02.879
We're not a gang, man.
This ain't primary school.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.479
What's his name anyway?

44:05.480 --> 44:06.959
It's Seth.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.279
Seth. Seth.

44:10.280 --> 44:14.279
"All right, my name is Seth.
Can I be one of your gang?"

44:15.880 --> 44:19.039
So I guess you stood me up.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.879
I was in a fucking coma.

44:20.880 --> 44:24.879
Oh, that's your excuse, is it?

44:26.240 --> 44:29.439
Kell... Sorry.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.079
Can we, er, borrow
your boyfriend's BMW?

44:32.080 --> 44:36.079
We've got a probation worker to bury
and he's actually quite heavy, so...

44:39.400 --> 44:43.399
Thanks... Seth.

44:47.440 --> 44:50.399
Cheers for getting me
out and everything.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.479
It's OK.

44:52.480 --> 44:56.479
But then I saved you from the
Nazis so we're probably all square.

44:58.440 --> 45:02.439
I'm glad you're back.

45:17.480 --> 45:20.279
You just fuck me and leave? You
said you weren't one of those guys!

45:20.280 --> 45:21.879
Yeah. I lied.

45:21.880 --> 45:25.879
You can't remember someone
you had sex with? Classy.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.919
What the fuck is that?!
Did I have sex with you last night?

45:30.920 --> 45:32.279
You need to try and
remember what happened.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.839
So you fucked someone in my bed?!

45:34.840 --> 45:37.159
I'm scared.

45:37.160 --> 45:37.959
Are you pregnant?

45:37.960 --> 45:39.039
What?

45:39.040 --> 45:41.839
It's OK. I know it's not
what either of us planned.

45:41.840 --> 45:45.839
I just want to say that
I'm there for you.

45:48.080 --> 45:51.759
I keep randomly changing.
Something's going on with my power.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.119
Swap back, just stop
moaning about it.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.559
I can't switch back.
