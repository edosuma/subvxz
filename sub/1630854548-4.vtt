WEBVTT

01:51.152 --> 01:53.154
The night was dark.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.367
The darkness had such a hold,

01:57.367 --> 02:00.036
not even the moon
would dare show its face.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.622
My whole body burned
with frostbite

02:02.622 --> 02:06.125
as I trudged
through the cold mountain air.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.461
After days of climbing,

02:08.461 --> 02:09.712
there it was.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.882
A museum perched
in an impossible place.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.553
I pounded on the door

02:16.553 --> 02:18.972
and finally found the man
I had come to see.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.975
Horst Eismann.

02:21.975 --> 02:27.355
An unseemly curator of
rare and mysterious artifacts.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.400
Before my father Niles
passed away,

02:30.400 --> 02:32.610
he traded this necklace
to Horst

02:32.610 --> 02:35.071
in order to help me
and The Doom Patrol.

02:35.071 --> 02:39.158
But I desperately
needed it back.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.077
I told him that
if I had the necklace,

02:41.077 --> 02:43.454
I might be able to conjure
my father from the afterlife

02:43.454 --> 02:47.208
and tell him all the things
I had never had a chance
to say.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.462
He just glared down at me.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.090
"No"

02:54.090 --> 02:58.428
was the only word
he could be bothered to utter.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.306
<i>If he wasn't going to give me
my father's necklace,</i>

03:02.265 --> 03:04.767
<i>I'd have to take it back.</i>

03:38.384 --> 03:41.846
<i>Once I had the necklace,</i>

03:41.846 --> 03:43.640
my friends Crystal
and The Dead Boys

03:43.640 --> 03:45.183
helped me summon my father

03:46.184 --> 03:47.101
and...

03:51.356 --> 03:53.274
our reunion was everything
I'd hoped it be.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.820
This necklace

03:57.820 --> 04:02.742
kept my father alive
so he could spend
nearly 100 years with me.

04:04.535 --> 04:08.539
And even though he's gone,
I know he'll always be in here.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.253
No matter how impossible
the odds may seem,

04:15.421 --> 04:17.006
love always wins out.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.348
"Fuck off and die"?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.350
How many times
are we going to come back
and do this?

04:28.935 --> 04:32.021
As long as it takes
for our message to stick.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.315
Let's get to work, ladies.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.658
<i>♪ I got this loving feeling♪</i>

04:43.658 --> 04:45.034

04:54.419 --> 04:57.088

04:59.090 --> 05:01.217
Survived another day
out there, ladies.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.136
Can't wait to get home.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.768
Stop!

05:10.768 --> 05:12.812
Cut it out.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.313
You want me
to say something?

05:15.314 --> 05:16.524
Dude.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.650
Let's just go.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.701

05:51.392 --> 05:52.435
Thanks, Danny.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.606
There's no place like, oh--

05:56.606 --> 05:58.107
Okay, come on now.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.489
Now you know I love you, D.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.575
But it looks like we're hitting
maximum occupancy here.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.411
You holding up okay?

06:13.122 --> 06:14.207
I know, baby.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.335
We all are.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.352
I'm fine.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.614
I'm not a kid anymore, Danny.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.325
Please stop hovering.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.622
Is she okay?

07:16.352 --> 07:17.645
What?

07:17.645 --> 07:19.689
If I promise
not to ask if you're okay,

07:19.689 --> 07:20.731
can I come in?

07:24.777 --> 07:26.362
Fine.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.074
If Danny sent you,

07:30.074 --> 07:31.868
I'll tell you the same thing
I told them.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.619
I don't need anybody
to help me.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.539
I'm just here to ask
if you wanted to do
a little karaoke,

07:36.539 --> 07:39.167
- but I'm guessing
the answer--
- No.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.251
You sure?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.837
We can do <i>Pure Imagination.</i>

07:42.837 --> 07:45.339
- Ooh.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:45.339 --> 07:46.757
Definitely no.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.467
Okay.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.345
I get it.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.556
After the day I've had,
I would love nothing more

07:53.556 --> 07:55.808
than to lock myself
in my dressing room

07:55.808 --> 07:57.810
and curl up into a ball.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.733
Why Maura Lee?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.193
What happened to you?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.861
Are you okay?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.654
Oh, I'm fine, Dorothy.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.908
It's not worth getting into,
but thank you for asking.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.452
- I was going to ask.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.912
The point is,

08:15.912 --> 08:18.289
whenever I feel like
nobody gets me,

08:19.165 --> 08:21.000
I put on my best wig,

08:21.000 --> 08:26.255
sashay onstage,
and belt one out
to the back row.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.383
You can't help but feel seen
in the spotlight.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.052
That's nice.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.432
If you ever need to talk,
you know we're
always here, right?

08:36.432 --> 08:37.600
I do know that.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.645
You are always here.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.939
Danny is always here.

08:42.939 --> 08:46.943
None of you will do what I ask
and just leave me alone.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.611
Well, it's hard for Danny
to leave you alone

08:48.611 --> 08:50.905
when you're sitting
right on top of them.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.952
You know,

08:55.952 --> 08:58.162
you shouldn't take Danny
for granted.

08:58.162 --> 09:02.166
Believe me when I tell you
things are tough out there
right now.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.712
More than ever,
people need Danny.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.383
We're very lucky
to have a safe space
to come home to.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.755
Space Case.

09:50.589 --> 09:51.632
This your girl?

09:53.759 --> 09:56.762
She seems very... peppy.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.264
She's awesome, actually.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.435
She saves the universe
from bad guys.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.646
She's never afraid
to do what she has to.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.273
Okay.

10:08.607 --> 10:09.608
Sorry.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.700
Okay, no tea, no shade.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.122
You can't stay cooped up
in your room like this
every day.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.208
We've been down this road
before, remember?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.044
Maybe you should get out
a little more.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.671
Didn't you literally
just tell me how bad it is
out there?

10:30.671 --> 10:32.590
Well, you can take care
of yourself.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.217
Don't you got all those
little imaginary friends
to back you up?

10:35.217 --> 10:36.594
Okay. Thank you.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.846
- Are we done here?
- Oh, excuse me, Ms. Thang.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.057
This Veruca Salt routine
is getting really tired.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.225
So maybe pull it back
a tad, okay?

10:43.225 --> 10:44.560
What do you want from me?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.062
I want you to quit
sitting around here

10:46.062 --> 10:48.314
reading about
someone else's adventures,

10:48.314 --> 10:50.066
and go have some of your own.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.317
I'm fine where I am.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.777
It doesn't seem like it.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.362
Where else am I going to go?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.489
What about the Doom Patrol?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.741
Don't you think
that's what Niles would want?

10:58.741 --> 10:59.700
No.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.285
He'd be thrilled, actually.

11:01.285 --> 11:04.330
I'm right back
in my prison cell
where I belong.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.000
Okay.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.337
If you don't feel like
any of us understand
what you're going through,

11:12.671 --> 11:14.340
try to find someone who can.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.350
Make new friends. Got it.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.954
Hello?

11:47.331 --> 11:48.457
What's going on?

12:01.011 --> 12:02.138
Asa Diamonds?

12:02.721 --> 12:03.722
That you?

12:05.808 --> 12:07.351
Go back inside.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.311
- I'm not a little--
- I said go!

12:15.526 --> 12:16.527
Asa?

12:18.237 --> 12:19.238
Honey?

12:20.531 --> 12:21.532
You okay?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.039
Where did everyone--

12:45.222 --> 12:47.391
Oh, shit.
Dorothy, I'm coming in.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.866
Danny, you gotta jump,
like now, okay?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.620
Dorothy, get away
from that--

13:09.872 --> 13:12.166
- It can't be.
- You know these things?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.334
They look just like...

13:16.629 --> 13:19.340
They're the bad guy's
foot soldiers from
my comic book.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.469
Dorothy, sweetie,

13:23.469 --> 13:25.679
now might be a good time
to introduce us to your friend,
the Candleman.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.598
He can't help us.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.391
- From what I heard,
I'm pretty sure he can--
- He can't.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.810
The only one who knows
how to deal with these things

13:32.394 --> 13:33.395
is...

14:16.313 --> 14:18.732
Space Case?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.776
Heya, kid.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.779
Is this...

14:23.779 --> 14:26.115
- Did I--
- Listen, I'd love to do
proper intros,

14:26.115 --> 14:27.950
but we better shake a leg.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.786
If the Vectra are here,
that means he can't be
far behind.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.121
Who?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.205
Torminox.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.428
Hmm.

14:59.106 --> 15:02.568
What the hell
did that TurboTax guy
do to them?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.902
Torminox.

15:03.902 --> 15:06.155
That no-good chrome dome
turns anyone he wants

15:06.155 --> 15:08.824
into his own personal
storm troopers.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.826
They're called the Vectra.

15:10.826 --> 15:14.496
But our people are still
in there somewhere, right?
We can fix them?

15:14.496 --> 15:17.499
First we've got to fix
that Torminox right good.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.792
But not to worry.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.544
Space Case is on the case.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.511
Cool.

15:29.511 --> 15:33.182
I've gone up against that
purple-faced chucklehead
143 times.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.850
You know how many times
I won?

15:34.850 --> 15:37.394
- I'm guessing one--
- 143 times.

15:37.394 --> 15:41.106
So if that slimy space
scoundrel rears his ugly head,

15:41.106 --> 15:43.692
I'll be sure to give him
the old one-two.

15:43.692 --> 15:48.197
Until then, it may be best
to make a quick getaway
and regroup.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.491
How?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.242
Do you have a
hyper-speed capable,
titanium alloy,

15:52.242 --> 15:53.744
intergalactic starship?

15:54.912 --> 15:56.121
It's in the shop.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.582
Oh. Hmm.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.209
Well, we may be able to--

16:00.209 --> 16:02.461
Holy mackerel,
what's that?

16:02.461 --> 16:03.796
What's what?

16:03.796 --> 16:07.007
Whenever I suck in
air through my nose,

16:07.007 --> 16:09.051
I can sense something.

16:09.051 --> 16:12.721
Oh, it's giving me a strange,
empty feeling in my...

16:12.721 --> 16:13.847
stomach.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.683
It's making me...

16:15.683 --> 16:16.809
Hungry?

16:17.893 --> 16:19.186
I guess so.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.312
What do I do?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.106
Here.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.155
Mmm.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.033
Mmm!

16:33.033 --> 16:34.702
Great Caesar's ghost!

16:34.702 --> 16:36.745
That is top notch!

16:38.080 --> 16:40.374
Okay, sweetie,
you're up at a Katy Perry.

16:40.374 --> 16:44.503
And I'm going to need you
to bring it way down
to an Alicia Keys.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.463
Dorothy? A word?

16:47.214 --> 16:48.215
Mmm.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.052
So...

16:52.052 --> 16:54.263
are you really out here
trying to tell me...

16:54.263 --> 16:58.308
that this crazy ass white lady
is some kind of
fictional character?

16:59.351 --> 17:00.602
Yes.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.479
- How?
- I don't know.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.982
Those things were banging
on our door,

17:04.982 --> 17:07.234
and then, I had a comic,

17:07.234 --> 17:10.237
and then... poof!

17:10.237 --> 17:12.322
And I thank you
for that poof.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.241
I do.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.160
But maybe just stuff
your cute little friend
back into your head, okay?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.620
That's just it, I can't.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.164
I don't think she's imaginary.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.040
I think maybe somehow...

17:23.041 --> 17:24.168
I pulled her out.

17:27.504 --> 17:30.632
- You can do that?
- Not usually.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.302
My imaginary friends
are all my own creations.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.220
- Is this Tampax?
- Torminox.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.847
- Whatever.
- Yes.

17:36.847 --> 17:41.810
The scuzziest scum-sucking,
space monster in the Galaxy.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.645
Fictional galaxy.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.689
He's also her dad.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.859
This busted ass
eggplant is that girl's daddy?

17:48.859 --> 17:50.861
Well, he wasn't always
like that.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.198
He was Richard Frank
before he became Torminox.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.741
But what does he want
with us?

17:55.741 --> 17:56.909
Maybe Casey would know?

18:02.206 --> 18:03.499
Just a few more bites.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.876
Then after that
Space Case is on the case.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.507
That's one of her catchphrases.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.467
No, yeah,
I'm getting that.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.052
Does she know
she's not real?

18:16.512 --> 18:17.679
I don't think so.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.516
Should we tell her?

18:20.516 --> 18:21.600
No.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.102
Not yet, at least.

18:24.102 --> 18:27.356
Right now she's our best bet
at getting our friends back.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.566
Okay, we won't tell her.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.235
Tell me what?

18:31.235 --> 18:33.570
- Nothing.
- Now you're
my new super-team, right?

18:33.570 --> 18:35.280
- Definitely.
- Are we?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.200
And super-teams
don't keep secrets.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.786
Especially from their
mission commander.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.289
So whatever intel
you've got in the hopper
won't phase me.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.374
Promise.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.608
Is this me?

19:11.608 --> 19:13.610
Did someone on your planet
hear about my adventures

19:13.610 --> 19:16.071
and write them
into a picture story?

19:16.071 --> 19:17.614
Not exactly.

19:17.614 --> 19:21.285
You sort of... are the story.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.246
What?

19:25.372 --> 19:26.206
Hey!

19:29.960 --> 19:31.670
Okay, buddy, that's it.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.508
What is she...

19:36.508 --> 19:37.509
Her special power.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.761
Time to pay the electric bill.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.764
Her quips are cheesy,
I know, but I still love them.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.516
- Dorothy.
- What?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.935
Is she about to
light up our friend
like a Christmas tree?

19:46.935 --> 19:47.811
Oh, my God.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.937
No, no, no, no, no...

19:53.150 --> 19:54.192
Sorry, Boo.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.153
What are you doing?

19:56.153 --> 19:57.362
That's not a Vectra.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.447
That's one of our friends.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.574
You can't just vaporize them.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.950
Why not?

20:01.950 --> 20:03.535
Because they're not
a comic book character.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.454
This is the real world.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.205
Death is...

20:09.041 --> 20:10.709
Death is permanent here.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.754
The real world?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.228
You're fiction, baby.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.774
Space Case is your
secret identity.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.985
Your real name's Casey Brinke.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.403
What? No.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.780
Who's Casey Brinke?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.198
Definitely not me.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.866
Nope, no way.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.868
And even if I was,
there's no way for you
to know that.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.621
Wait, Casey Casey.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.081
I know a lot more than that.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.334
<i>When you were seven,
your father, Richard,</i>

20:52.334 --> 20:54.294
<i>got into a horrible
lab accident.</i>

20:55.754 --> 20:58.507
<i>And it turned him into
the monster he is today.</i>

21:01.885 --> 21:03.595
<i>I know, years later,</i>

21:06.181 --> 21:07.808
<i>your mother faced Torminox</i>

21:07.808 --> 21:11.144
<i>and sacrificed herself
to save the universe.</i>

21:22.114 --> 21:25.909
And, I know Torminox
didn't die in that explosion.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.537
He never dies, does he?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.623
He always finds a way
to come back.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.878
- Yes.
- From that day onward,

21:36.878 --> 21:38.714
you spent years in training,

21:38.714 --> 21:41.341
harnessing the power
you inherited from your mom.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.636
<i>You dedicated
your whole life</i>

21:44.636 --> 21:50.767
<i>to stopping your father
at a great personal cost.</i>

21:59.818 --> 22:01.987
And you've been
fighting him ever since.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.492
One hundred
and forty-three times.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.957
You loved your father once.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.545
But, after he
turned into Torminox,

22:18.545 --> 22:21.048
you knew he was gone.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.717
As far as you're concerned,
he may as well be dead.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.512
How do you know all this?

22:42.819 --> 22:44.279
Where did you get this?

22:44.279 --> 22:46.615
I found them all in
my friend Flex Mentallo's room.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.908
But where did he get them?

22:48.867 --> 22:49.826
I don't know.

22:58.043 --> 22:58.919
He's here.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.425
Run!

23:14.893 --> 23:15.811
Move!

23:19.606 --> 23:20.607
There you are.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.404
- I take it that's...
- Torminox.

23:26.404 --> 23:30.742
In the flesh.
I came for one thing.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.119
And, what's that?

23:32.119 --> 23:33.328
Your necklace.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.831
Give it to me and
no one else need suffer.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.458
No.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.168
Very well then.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.713
No!

23:56.268 --> 23:57.352
What are you doing here?

23:57.352 --> 23:59.187
Blasting you into stardust,

23:59.187 --> 24:02.274
if you don't call off
your goons and turn
these people back.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.860
I have no quarrel
with you, daughter.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.237
Leave this place. Please...

24:10.949 --> 24:12.784
Please.
What are you...

24:17.455 --> 24:19.708
- You never...
- What are you doing?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.712
You never say please.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.842
I can't.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.260
Finish this.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.477
You have every right
to hate me right now.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.813
But I need you.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.608
Please.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.901
Who are you...

25:13.178 --> 25:14.846
Candlemaker!

25:16.473 --> 25:20.268
Go now.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.354
Come on,
listen to your friend.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.106
I'm so sorry. For everything.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.483
Go!

25:40.664 --> 25:42.123
In here...

26:01.309 --> 26:03.144
What does he want
with my necklace?

26:03.144 --> 26:05.230
I don't know.
But whatever it is,
it can't be good.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.274
What happened to you
back there?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.566
I don't know.

26:08.566 --> 26:10.485
How could you stand there
and do nothing?

26:10.485 --> 26:11.861
I'm sorry. That...

26:11.861 --> 26:15.031
What happened to
"Space Case is on the case"?

26:15.031 --> 26:16.700
You never hesitate,

26:16.700 --> 26:19.452
especially when it comes
to your father.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.249
You're right.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.627
I've destroyed Torminox
143 times.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.212
I pushed him into a volcano.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.672
I froze him
in liquid nitrogen.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.965
I hit him with an asteroid.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.926
But something
was different this time.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.763
I felt something.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.682
What?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.518
Well...

26:43.518 --> 26:48.023
You said it yourself before.
He always comes back.

26:49.649 --> 26:53.486
But what if this time
he didn't?

27:00.952 --> 27:02.996
When I looked into his eyes,

27:04.456 --> 27:07.000
something came to me.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.461
I'm not even really sure
you could call it a memory,

27:09.461 --> 27:13.256
but he was pushing me
on the swing

27:15.592 --> 27:16.551
and we were happy.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.722
Really happy.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.642
As much as I hate Torminox,

27:28.229 --> 27:30.440
he's all I have left
of my father.

27:32.984 --> 27:37.781
So, if what you say
is true and death
is really permanent here

27:37.781 --> 27:40.742
and there's no coming back...

27:42.535 --> 27:44.287
then he'd really be gone

27:46.956 --> 27:48.750
and what would I be left with?

27:50.919 --> 27:53.004
What would I even do
with myself?

27:54.547 --> 27:56.758
Maybe you don't have
to find out.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.093
What do you mean?

27:58.093 --> 28:00.720
Maybe your father
is still in there somewhere.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.848
Maybe you can
get through to him.

28:03.848 --> 28:07.894
No matter how impossible
it might seem to reach someone,

28:07.894 --> 28:09.938
there's always a way.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.774
Just ask Dorothy.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.112
It's true.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.448
You can.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.836
Oh, hell no.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.796
You can't.
It's not safe out there.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.839
Don't care.

28:37.799 --> 28:40.176
Hey, what is your problem?

28:40.176 --> 28:42.595
Haven't you kids
already done enough damage?

28:42.595 --> 28:45.056
If you're going to be out here
spreading that kind of hate,

28:45.056 --> 28:48.101
then best be able
to look me in the...

28:48.101 --> 28:50.270
I'm sorry, I was only
trying to help.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.400
I see what those guys
keep doing to your mural.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.529
Not everyone here
feels the same way
they do.

29:01.698 --> 29:02.740
Thank you.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.878
How much paint you got?

29:25.638 --> 29:27.974
I see you've finally
come to your senses.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.685
Let's make this simple.

29:30.685 --> 29:34.022
Your friends for the necklace.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.650
You don't have to do this.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.778
You don't have to be
the villain.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.325
You were something more once.
Remember?

30:06.763 --> 30:08.056
You were my dad.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.071
No!

30:23.071 --> 30:24.364
The necklace.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.406
Now.

30:31.955 --> 30:35.875
This is all I have left
of my father.

30:35.875 --> 30:40.046
I wanted to tell him
all the things I needed to say.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.132
But I never did.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.968
That's of no concern to me.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.594
Can it, Telefax.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.639
What do you mean?

30:51.391 --> 30:52.559
It's a lie.

30:53.935 --> 30:58.690
Candlemaker and I
never went to get this back.

30:58.690 --> 31:02.402
Crystal and the Dead Boys
had to get it for me.

31:02.402 --> 31:06.656
The truth is,
I haven't talked to
the Candlemaker in months.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.408
Or any of my friends.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.619
I locked them all away.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.289
Why?

31:14.289 --> 31:19.127
Because they reminded me
too much of my father.

31:19.127 --> 31:24.299
Everyone does. My friends,
Danny, the Doom Patrol.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.635
All they do is remind me of
what I lost.

31:27.635 --> 31:30.430
I thought that
if I conjured him
for just a few minutes,

31:30.430 --> 31:33.182
I might be able to tell him
how much I loved him.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.605
But the more time passed,
the more I realized

31:38.605 --> 31:40.857
that's not all
that I needed to say.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.321
I'm not the person
I used to be.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.781
I'm confused.

31:48.781 --> 31:52.160
I'm scared and I'm angry.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.664
And he was supposed
to help me through it.

31:56.664 --> 32:03.004
He kept me a child for so long
and now that I'm finally
growing up,

32:03.004 --> 32:05.131
he's not here.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.716
And I hate him for it.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.928
I want to say all of these
things to him.

32:12.555 --> 32:14.932
But maybe some things
are better left unsaid.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.990
She needs her Dad.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.826
Fuck you for turning
your back on that.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.875
Don't blame yourself, Danny.

33:22.875 --> 33:26.587
You've done so much
for everyone here.

33:26.587 --> 33:30.216
But no matter how hard
you try, you can't protect us
from everything.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.676
Not by yourself.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.472
I know how hard things
can be out there.

33:36.472 --> 33:39.100
Believe me, I get it.

33:39.100 --> 33:44.188
But, tonight,
someone reminded me
that there are still

33:44.188 --> 33:49.026
good people in the world.
People who want to help.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.195
True allies.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.115
And if we ever really want
to change the world,

33:54.115 --> 33:57.076
we need to start living in it.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.874
I think it's time for us
to move on to something new.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.792
Including you, Danny.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.920
Ever since you became
an ambulance, you've been
doing triage, honey.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.716
We all know that
you'll always be

34:11.716 --> 34:16.888
a safe space to heal to anyone
and everyone, who needs it.

34:16.888 --> 34:21.893
But it's time we start making
safe spaces of our own.

34:23.686 --> 34:24.687
In the real world.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.695
Does this mean we have
to leave?

34:37.116 --> 34:38.576
But what if we're never ready?

34:43.581 --> 34:47.710

Everything my dad

write us a new one.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.815
