WEBVTT

03:50.197 --> 03:54.284
It's her! I know it's her!
She wants to tell us something!

03:54.368 --> 03:55.819
- We must do something!
- Sit down!

03:55.903 --> 03:58.804
- Please!
- Hey!

04:10.884 --> 04:15.339
In the name of His Imperial Majesty
and the city of Vienna...

04:15.422 --> 04:18.809
I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz...

04:18.892 --> 04:21.778
also known as Eisenheim
the Illusionist...

04:21.862 --> 04:25.048
on charges of disturbing public order...

04:25.132 --> 04:28.619
charlatanism and threats
against the empire!

04:28.702 --> 04:31.899
Leave him alone!

04:36.843 --> 04:39.471
They're arresting him!
They're arresting Eisenheim!

05:02.669 --> 05:05.103
Chief Inspector Uhl.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.503
- You're late.
- My apologies, Your Highness.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.539
I was attending to
the loose ends of the case.

05:22.623 --> 05:26.443
- Are there still loose ends?
- Very few.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.517
Did he do it again?

05:30.964 --> 05:33.150
How does he do it?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.724
I'm afraid I still don't know.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.389
Did you ask him?

05:39.473 --> 05:41.892
He's not talking at this point.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.462
Well, I'm sure
you have... methods...

05:45.546 --> 05:48.208
for that kind of thing.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.636
I want you to put an end to it.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.812
Surely you have something on him.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.323
Something from his past?

05:59.426 --> 06:03.795
Yes. Yes, I think I do.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.337
<i>In fact, we know all about his life.</i>

06:14.908 --> 06:18.400
<i>We've spoken to almost everyone
who ever knew him.</i>

06:24.318 --> 06:26.837
<i>As a boy, I'm told
he had a chance encounter...</i>

06:26.920 --> 06:29.788
<i>with a traveling magician.</i>

06:34.261 --> 06:36.526
Boy.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.848
<i>One version of the story was
that the man himself...</i>

07:11.932 --> 07:14.651
<i>then vanished...</i>

07:14.735 --> 07:17.855
<i>along with the tree.</i>

07:17.938 --> 07:19.997
<i>Who knows what actually happened?</i>

07:35.322 --> 07:38.909
<i>People began to think he had
some kind of special power...</i>

07:38.992 --> 07:42.655
<i>or at least that
he was a bit different.</i>

07:47.601 --> 07:49.592
<i>And then he met her.</i>

07:59.646 --> 08:02.432
- Don't drop it.
- Careful, you're going to trip.

08:02.516 --> 08:06.537
- Drop it, you muck snipe.
- Watch out for that hole, alley rat!

08:06.620 --> 08:08.612
- Drop it!
- Come on.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.498
Pick a card.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.735
Put it back in the deck.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.971
Now, watch.

08:48.795 --> 08:52.322
Duchess von Teschen, you can't be
in a place like this. They're peasants.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.991
Remember who you are.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.150
<i>She was brought back to the castle...</i>

09:27.234 --> 09:29.253
<i>and they were forbidden
to see each other.</i>

09:29.336 --> 09:33.190
<i>But soon, they were doing just that.</i>

09:33.273 --> 09:36.627
<i>Over the next few years, they could
always find a way to be together.</i>

09:36.710 --> 09:40.147
Quick, come on.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.871
In China there's a magician
that could make anything disappear-

09:47.955 --> 09:50.340
a house, a wagon, anything.

09:50.424 --> 09:54.912
We'll go visit him. They can't stop us
if we want to be together.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.347
They'll never find us.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.551
Do you promise
you'll take me with you?

10:00.634 --> 10:03.053
One day I will.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.823
One day we'll run away together.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.897
We'll disappear.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.117
There's a secret way to open it.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.455
I wanted a picture.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.941
Sophie, are you there?

11:28.822 --> 11:32.485
- We must hurry! They're coming!
- Duchess von Teschen!

11:33.994 --> 11:37.681
Duchess von Teschen!

11:37.764 --> 11:41.962
- Duchess von Teschen!
- Duchess von Teschen!

11:44.338 --> 11:48.125
Make us disappear.
Make us disappear.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.643
Duchess von Teschen!

11:55.382 --> 11:57.316
Stop. Stop.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.275
- Don't do this.
- Let go!

12:05.359 --> 12:09.279
- Let me go. Let go!
- Your father's waiting for you.

12:09.363 --> 12:12.683
- Let go!
- No!

12:12.766 --> 12:15.152
- Eduard!
- Please, let go!

12:15.235 --> 12:17.454
- No!
- Let me go!

12:17.538 --> 12:21.425
Let her go, please!

12:21.508 --> 12:24.194
- Let go! Stop it!
- Sophie!

12:24.278 --> 12:26.196
Eduard!

12:26.280 --> 12:28.165
- Sophie!
- Eduard!

12:28.248 --> 12:30.801
Sophie.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.970
Stay away from her, or next time...

12:33.053 --> 12:35.886
we'll arrest you and your family.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.819
<i>What happened next remains a mystery.</i>

12:48.902 --> 12:51.755
<i>We do know that
he traveled the world...</i>

12:51.838 --> 12:54.691
<i>that he began to perform
his magic in public...</i>

12:54.775 --> 12:57.505
<i>that he changed his name
to Eisenheim.</i>

12:59.646 --> 13:03.000
<i>And then almost 15 years later...</i>

13:03.083 --> 13:05.074
<i>he appeared in Vienna.</i>

13:12.092 --> 13:14.411
Life and death...

13:14.494 --> 13:17.915
space and time...

13:17.998 --> 13:21.051
fate and chance.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.688
These are the forces
of the universe.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.524
Tonight, ladies and gentleman...

13:27.608 --> 13:33.330
I present to you a man who has
unlocked these mysteries.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.465
From the furthest corners
of the world...

13:35.549 --> 13:39.303
where the dark arts
still hold sway...

13:39.386 --> 13:42.239
he returns to us to demonstrate...

13:42.322 --> 13:46.443
how nature's laws may be bent.

13:46.527 --> 13:50.553
I give you... Eisenheim.

14:00.641 --> 14:02.939
Might I borrow a handkerchief
from someone?

14:05.779 --> 14:07.770
You, madam.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.648
Thank you.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.751
Be patient.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.859
Now, if you please.

14:31.238 --> 14:35.926
I would like to continue
with an examination of time.

14:36.009 --> 14:40.464
From the moment we enter this life,
we are in the flow of it.

14:40.547 --> 14:45.235
We measure it and we mark it,
but we cannot defy it.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.754
We cannot even speed it up
or slow it down.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.216
Or can we?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.813
Have we not each
experienced the sensation...

14:56.897 --> 15:00.551
that a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly...

15:00.634 --> 15:03.364
and wished that
we could make it linger?

15:05.839 --> 15:09.243
Or felt time slow on a dull day...

15:09.376 --> 15:12.937
and wished that we could
speed things up a bit?

16:19.346 --> 16:22.099
I assure you, they're quite real.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.334
Is it real? Let's see.

16:24.418 --> 16:27.819
And you, madam,
where is your handkerchief?

16:58.185 --> 17:00.871
Bravo!

17:00.954 --> 17:02.945
Very good.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.077
Give us something, please.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.914
- Please, give us something. Please.
- What's all this?

17:11.998 --> 17:14.251
We're poor.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.234
- Do you think you're poor?
- Yes.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.023
I want to show you something.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.026
You're not poor.

17:23.109 --> 17:27.130
You have everything
that you need right here.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.204
Thank you.

17:30.584 --> 17:32.574
Thank you.

17:34.588 --> 17:36.572
Thank you.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.647
And that's yours.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.126
And this too.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.001
I've got the magic one!

18:00.414 --> 18:04.468
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.537
- Coffee?
- No.

18:06.620 --> 18:09.851
- Strudel? I have two.
- Nothing, thank you.

18:12.726 --> 18:16.346
You look very pleased with yourself.
How are the receipts?

18:16.430 --> 18:18.549
- Not bad. A three-quarter house.
- Well done.

18:18.632 --> 18:21.018
But we're going to do better
than that. Listen to this.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.855
Listen. "There is no argument
that his uncanny displays...

18:24.938 --> 18:29.525
"separate him from the ranks
of garden-variety stage wizards.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.462
"Some of his effects
transcend mere illusion...

18:32.546 --> 18:35.599
"and approach the realm of art.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.701
He is very young to be so masterful."

18:38.884 --> 18:42.805
Do you see?
We'll pack the house with this review.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.309
We are going to make more money
than you ever dreamed of.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.978
But if it was mechanical.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.247
Maybe he had it wrapped
in some kind of bark?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.382
Oh, I know, of course
I thought of that.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.650
It's the butterflies
I'm trying to work out.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.221
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Invisible wire.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.224
Too obvious. How many men
have you detailed for tonight?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.893
We have eight men inside,
another eight out front.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.342
Perhaps you'll get another look
at your butterflies.

19:11.183 --> 19:15.553
- Come on in.
- Check the last 10 rows there.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.262
You! Don't touch that!

19:38.345 --> 19:40.264
- Put that down!
- Herr Eisenheim.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.566
Who are you and what do you
think you're doing?

19:42.649 --> 19:46.103
I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl
and I'm inspecting your theater.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.106
I've seen you perform.
Very impressive.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.875
- Very impressive.
- How can we help you, Inspector?

19:52.959 --> 19:55.511
You will be honored to know
the crown prince...

19:55.595 --> 19:57.581
plans to attend
your performance tonight.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.750
- The crown prince?
- Yes!

19:59.833 --> 20:02.251
So, obviously we have
to inspect the theater.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.520
I think that one's small
for an assassin, don't you?

20:04.604 --> 20:08.257
Yes, the orange tree.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.661
You know, I have seen things
like this before...

20:10.744 --> 20:14.298
but never one like that.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.300
- Extraordinary.
- Thank you.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.336
I have been puzzling
over how it works...

20:19.419 --> 20:22.946
especially how the butterflies fly.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.311
I assure you,
your secret is safe with me.

20:27.394 --> 20:31.481
I'm an officer of the law after all,
and a bit of an amateur conjurer.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.851
- Are you really?
- Yes.

20:33.934 --> 20:38.064
Well, card tricks, coins,
sleight of hand, yes.

20:39.706 --> 20:43.870
But nothing fancy.
Perhaps you'll give me a tip.

20:45.546 --> 20:48.065
Yes, all right.

20:48.148 --> 20:50.766
I'll show you one I'm very fond of.
Are you a gambling man?

20:50.850 --> 20:51.747
On occasion, yes.

20:51.828 --> 20:54.438
I will bet you the secret
of the orange tree...

20:54.521 --> 20:57.708
that I can guess which hand
you place this in every time.

20:57.791 --> 21:00.444
Excellent.

21:00.527 --> 21:04.213
Put it in your fist, raise your hand
against your forehead...

21:04.297 --> 21:07.284
concentrate on it,
form a mental picture.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.286
- Yes.
- Have you got it?

21:09.369 --> 21:12.031
- Yes.
- Put your hands in front of you.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.960
It's in your left.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.962
- Well-
- A lucky guess, perhaps.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.231
You have a confederate
who signals you.

21:22.315 --> 21:25.302
No. It's more primitive than that.

21:25.385 --> 21:29.573
When you raise your hand to your head,
the blood drains from it.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.647
It will be paler every time.

21:35.695 --> 21:40.517
Oh, I like that very much.

21:40.601 --> 21:43.020
Please take it with my compliments.

21:43.103 --> 21:46.023
Why, thank you.
Eh, the blood drains.

21:46.106 --> 21:49.693
Now, Inspector...

21:49.776 --> 21:52.506
if you don't mind, I've got to prepare
for tonight's performance.

22:04.892 --> 22:07.778
Please stand for His Imperial Highness...

22:07.861 --> 22:10.762
Crown Prince Leopold.

22:37.824 --> 22:42.411
I thought we might end this evening
with a discussion of the soul.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.047
All of the greatest religions...

22:45.131 --> 22:49.318
speak of the soul's endurance
beyond the end of life.

22:49.402 --> 22:54.066
So, what then
does it mean... to die?

22:55.241 --> 22:57.961
I need a volunteer
from the audience.

22:58.045 --> 23:00.979
Someone not afraid of death.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.334
Please, someone?

23:05.418 --> 23:07.785
I assure you,
no tragedy will befall you.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.810
It's an honor, Duchess von Teschen.

23:52.533 --> 23:55.057
Do you know me?

23:56.136 --> 23:57.967
No.

24:00.173 --> 24:02.726
You're quite certain
that we've never met before?

24:02.809 --> 24:04.538
Yes, of course.

24:18.892 --> 24:22.179
Now please gaze
directly into my eyes.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.322
Look nowhere else.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.358
Wave to yourself.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.036
Turn in a circle.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.708
Now bow to yourself.

25:59.459 --> 26:01.690
Away.

27:04.223 --> 27:08.478
They must have liked you. They've
waited for you nearly five minutes.

27:08.562 --> 27:12.931
Your Highness, may I introduce
Eisenheim the Illusionist?

27:17.271 --> 27:20.757
- Well done.
- Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it.

27:20.841 --> 27:23.627
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.463
Stimulated great debate
amongst us, hasn't it?

27:26.547 --> 27:28.932
Except of course for your assistant,
Duchess von Teschen.

27:29.016 --> 27:31.768
You seemed to have struck her
quite speechless. A feat in itself.

27:31.852 --> 27:35.605
- Did you hypnotize her?
- In a fashion.

27:35.688 --> 27:38.742
I'd like to learn that trick.

27:38.825 --> 27:44.114
Rainier here thinks you have
supernatural powers.

27:44.198 --> 27:46.358
Do you claim supernatural powers?

27:47.668 --> 27:50.086
I've never said anything
of that kind.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.056
- Then you won't mind a question or two.
- Now let's not ruin it.

27:53.140 --> 27:56.459
You needn't divulge
anything I can't guess.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.228
As you wish.

27:58.312 --> 28:00.397
Your assistants
are behind the mirror...

28:00.480 --> 28:04.100
somewhere in robes obviously.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.704
Lights in the frame perhaps
to illuminate them, or angled mirrors?

28:07.788 --> 28:10.740
That would be one way to do it.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.510
I think I understand it all
except the ghost.

28:13.594 --> 28:15.645
That was very, very good.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.615
Another viewing perhaps?

28:18.699 --> 28:21.785
You must come to the Hofburg next time.
We'll make an evening of it.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.487
That will be my pleasure.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.957
So be it.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.406
Sophie?

28:36.482 --> 28:39.235
And we'll gather
our best minds next time.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.271
You'll really have a challenge then.

28:41.355 --> 28:44.208
Then I'll prepare something special.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.349
Perhaps I'll make you disappear.

28:58.771 --> 29:01.624
My God.
When he volunteered her...

29:01.707 --> 29:05.795
I heard the crashing sound
of money falling on me in piles.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.866
Every lady of means in Vienna will
want to get up there with you now.

29:08.949 --> 29:10.868
What a show-off.

29:10.951 --> 29:13.604
His father would have died
if he had seen such a display.

29:13.687 --> 29:17.207
- She didn't seem too happy about it either.
- She'd better get used to it.

29:17.291 --> 29:20.677
- How's that?
- Word is she'll marry him soon.

29:20.761 --> 29:24.280
- Really?
- Taking her chances if you ask me.

29:24.363 --> 29:27.017
- Why?
- He likes to give his lady friends...

29:27.100 --> 29:29.552
a good thrashing now and again.

29:29.635 --> 29:31.688
People say he pushed one of them
off a balcony...

29:31.772 --> 29:34.638
just to cover
the beating he'd given her.

30:02.336 --> 30:05.170
For Herr Eisenheim.

30:46.844 --> 30:48.778
Hello, Sophie.

30:53.550 --> 30:57.771
When I was on the stage,
you knew me right away.

30:57.855 --> 31:00.542
It took me a moment...

31:00.625 --> 31:03.078
but, yes, I knew.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.579
You could have said something.

31:05.663 --> 31:07.748
I thought you'd figure
it out eventually.

31:07.831 --> 31:09.985
Yes, I would have.

31:10.068 --> 31:12.554
I would have come another night,
volunteered...

31:12.637 --> 31:14.623
walked right on stage
and said, "Hello."

31:14.706 --> 31:17.057
And then you'd really
have had to move quickly.

31:17.141 --> 31:19.404
I suspect you would have.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.904
I don't understand why.

31:28.086 --> 31:32.107
Perhaps for the same reasons you
find it prudent to meet in a carriage.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.590
It's just a game
I have to play with them.

31:37.328 --> 31:41.924
I'm followed everywhere. It's-
It's supposed to be for my protection.

31:44.102 --> 31:46.121
Yes.

31:46.204 --> 31:50.724
So, I hear congratulations
are in order.

31:50.808 --> 31:53.395
What for?

31:53.478 --> 31:55.796
They say you'll be the princess.

31:55.879 --> 31:59.213
It's not decided at all.

32:00.551 --> 32:03.238
It makes a certain sense, I suppose.

32:03.321 --> 32:06.875
We've known each other for years,
and of course, our families.

32:06.958 --> 32:09.476
He's very intelligent.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.052
A little too intelligent
for his own good.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.788
You're lucky, you know...

32:19.871 --> 32:22.669
to have broken free as you did.

32:24.709 --> 32:27.472
I often wish that I had-

32:30.615 --> 32:32.548
Wished what?

32:35.887 --> 32:38.480
Wished that I would see you again.

32:43.261 --> 32:45.319
And now you have.

32:47.464 --> 32:51.060
Yes, now I have.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.861
I look forward to seeing you
again at the Hofburg.

33:00.944 --> 33:03.277
Until then.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.224
Here's the report
on Duchess von Teschen.

33:29.307 --> 33:31.660
Anything interesting?

33:31.743 --> 33:33.734
See for yourself.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.405
The magician?

33:43.488 --> 33:45.407
They drove around for half an hour.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.323
Then he got out near the theater.

33:51.528 --> 33:54.396
What do you want us to do?

34:11.783 --> 34:14.775
Join us for a drink?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.688
Please.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.621
You like something to eat,
something to drink?

34:35.706 --> 34:37.958
- No, thank you.
- Herr Eisenheim...

34:38.042 --> 34:41.763
I'm going to ask you a question...

34:41.846 --> 34:43.831
that may not seem friendly...

34:43.915 --> 34:47.476
but I assure you, in fact, is.

34:49.387 --> 34:53.540
What is your relationship
with the Duchess von Teschen?

34:53.623 --> 34:56.342
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.879
Oh, but that is precisely my point.

34:58.962 --> 35:02.650
For, you see,
where others might judge...

35:02.733 --> 35:07.521
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be...

35:07.604 --> 35:11.200
I am willing to find out
what it actually was.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.663
All right. We were
childhood acquaintances.

35:15.746 --> 35:18.133
Acquaintances?

35:18.216 --> 35:20.502
Childhood friends.

35:20.585 --> 35:22.736
My father was a cabinetmaker.

35:22.820 --> 35:26.441
He made the furniture for her family's house.

35:26.524 --> 35:29.843
I see, the cabinetmaker's son
friends with a-

35:29.927 --> 35:34.816
- Has there been a complaint?
- Oh, no, no. If there'd been a complaint...

35:34.899 --> 35:38.390
well, we'd be having a very,
different sort of conversation.

35:39.770 --> 35:44.391
Yes. He relies on you for
that sort of thing, does he?

35:44.475 --> 35:47.394
I'm a simple public servant,
Herr Eisenheim.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.531
That's not what I hear.

35:49.614 --> 35:53.268
I hear you'll be
the chief of police very soon.

35:53.351 --> 35:57.871
- Maybe mayor of Vienna? Party secretary?
- All subject to his whim.

35:57.955 --> 36:01.009
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the parliament before you get there.

36:01.092 --> 36:05.547
Now the prince has some progressive ideas,
but he will make a fine emperor.

36:05.630 --> 36:09.384
Well, they say you're very close to him,
so I'm sure you'll do fine.

36:09.467 --> 36:15.255
Look. Yes, indeed, they say
that I'm very close to the prince.

36:15.339 --> 36:20.462
But the simple truth of the matter is,
Herr Eisenheim, I'm the son of a butcher.

36:20.545 --> 36:24.598
He's the heir to the empire.
How close could we be to such as him?

36:24.682 --> 36:28.448
Do you see my point?

36:32.823 --> 36:36.054
Don't fool yourself that
you can play in their game.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.848
I've served on the edge of it...

36:39.931 --> 36:43.917
for... many, many years...

36:44.001 --> 36:46.086
and I can tell you with certainty...

36:46.170 --> 36:49.469
there's no trick they haven't seen.

36:53.110 --> 36:56.011
It's not worth it.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.836
My guest tonight...

37:02.920 --> 37:08.142
is not a showman at all,
but rather a wizard...

37:08.225 --> 37:11.745
who has sold his soul
to the devil...

37:11.829 --> 37:15.250
in return for unholy powers.

37:15.333 --> 37:18.285
Or so at least some of our friends here
would have us believe.

37:18.369 --> 37:20.788
But fear not.

37:20.871 --> 37:26.060
Everything can
and will be explained.

37:26.143 --> 37:30.664
- All mysteries penetrated.
- Hear! Hear!

37:30.748 --> 37:33.808
Well said! Well said!

37:59.443 --> 38:02.162
- Is that the emperor?
- Yes, your father.

38:02.246 --> 38:05.545
I didn't think he was invited.

38:07.218 --> 38:09.812
Bravo.

38:15.826 --> 38:19.213
A fair likeness of the old man.

38:19.296 --> 38:22.650
Too modern a style for him, of course.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.852
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a painter.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.188
It's true. There are no brushstrokes
in this painting.

38:28.272 --> 38:31.659
I can see that clearly.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.661
So to achieve the color...

38:33.744 --> 38:37.564
some sort of chemical must
be interacting, presumably.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.535
Some sort of sprayer up your sleeve?

38:40.619 --> 38:43.883
- May I?
- If you feel you must.

38:45.556 --> 38:49.243
- I do.
- Oh, let the man do his show.

38:49.326 --> 38:52.379
You want me to just sit there
when it's so obvious?

38:52.463 --> 38:54.782
I do.

38:54.865 --> 38:57.518
He tries to trick you.
I try to enlighten you.

38:57.601 --> 38:59.921
Which is the more noble pursuit?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.923
May we have the lights, please...

39:02.007 --> 39:04.292
so His Highness can better see?

39:04.376 --> 39:08.096
- See here, Leopold, let's have the show.
- Hear! Hear!

39:08.179 --> 39:10.531
- Come on, Leopold.
- Get on with it.

39:10.614 --> 39:13.447
Very well. I propose a challenge.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.439
Why don't you astonish us...

39:18.522 --> 39:20.842
if you can...

39:20.925 --> 39:25.313
without all the... gadgetry?

39:25.397 --> 39:27.956
As you wish.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.152
Your sword is very beautiful.

39:32.236 --> 39:33.955
Might I see it?

39:34.039 --> 39:36.029
Certainly.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.667
May I?

39:47.017 --> 39:49.645
Where does power flow from?

39:51.655 --> 39:55.353
Skill or destiny, or divine right?

39:57.528 --> 40:01.328
We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.

40:02.801 --> 40:06.532
Excalibur's blade
was fixed in stone...

40:10.141 --> 40:12.701
and there it stayed.

40:14.845 --> 40:19.434
Many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone.

40:19.517 --> 40:22.270
Only Arthur succeeded...

40:22.354 --> 40:24.304
proving his right to rule.

40:24.388 --> 40:27.207
Who can take this sword?

40:27.291 --> 40:31.455
You, sir, can you take the sword?

40:52.484 --> 40:54.635
No surprise there.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.209
Perhaps you, sir.

40:59.156 --> 41:02.490
Not so eager, cousin.

41:05.397 --> 41:07.514
Come on. You can do it.

41:07.598 --> 41:11.090
- Do it! Do it!
- Come on!

41:18.342 --> 41:21.763
You shall live a long life.

41:21.846 --> 41:24.747
Thank you for your indulgence.

41:37.494 --> 41:40.248
Come now. If you can't pull it out,
you'll never be emperor.

41:40.332 --> 41:43.732
Your father will live to be a hundred.

41:55.646 --> 41:58.410
The sword to its rightful owner!

42:08.759 --> 42:12.413
That's enough light entertainment
for this evening.

42:12.496 --> 42:16.661
For more serious discussion,
please join me for a drink.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.499
Shut him down.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.967
Well, he's very popular,
Your Highness.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.713
I'm sure you'll find a way.

42:43.093 --> 42:48.216
- What did you do to him?
- I gave him what he asked for.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.751
What would possess you
to do something so foolish?

42:50.834 --> 42:55.723
Duchess von Teschen,
you must come along, my dear.

42:55.806 --> 42:58.860
We don't want to keep
the prince waiting.

42:58.944 --> 43:01.562
- Did you enjoy the show?
- It was wonderful, wasn't it?

43:01.645 --> 43:04.171
It was amusing.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.905
Who told you where to find me?

43:43.989 --> 43:48.509
Your manager. I told him if he wants
to stay in Vienna, you need my help.

43:48.592 --> 43:51.145
So I'm to be driven
from the city, is that it?

43:51.228 --> 43:54.356
- Good. I shall relish it.
- Stop it!

43:56.101 --> 43:58.219
I came here to try to help you.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.989
Why? Why should you possibly
care what happens to me now?

44:02.072 --> 44:04.492
You were my friend.
I am your friend.

44:04.576 --> 44:09.497
We knew each other very briefly
a long time ago. You don't know me at all.

44:09.581 --> 44:14.484
Then why did you speak to me?
Why did you even bother talking-

45:30.395 --> 45:32.863
And you kept it all this time.

45:34.566 --> 45:38.219
I used to sit and stare
at your picture...

45:38.303 --> 45:40.794
trying to imagine where you were.

45:42.340 --> 45:47.162
At night I'd have dreams
I had gone with you...

45:47.245 --> 45:50.977
and then I'd wake up
and realize where I was.

45:58.456 --> 46:02.154
But in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard.

46:10.468 --> 46:13.927
Where did you go when you left?

46:16.341 --> 46:18.740
To my uncle's farm near Prague.

46:20.011 --> 46:22.003
How exotic.

46:25.317 --> 46:28.270
I went to Russia...

46:28.353 --> 46:30.272
then Asia Minor...

46:30.355 --> 46:32.941
and then the Orient for many years.

46:33.024 --> 46:35.343
So long.

46:35.427 --> 46:37.918
I always meant to return.

46:39.531 --> 46:44.468
I just-I kept thinking I'd find it
around the next corner.

46:45.570 --> 46:47.561
What?

46:49.174 --> 46:51.108
A real mystery.

46:53.944 --> 46:56.064
I saw remarkable things...

46:56.147 --> 46:59.467
but the only mystery
I never solved was...

46:59.551 --> 47:02.611
why my heart couldn't let go of you.

47:23.708 --> 47:26.294
He wants me to go to Budapest...

47:26.378 --> 47:28.811
with him next week
to announce our engagement.

47:31.016 --> 47:34.769
He wants the Hungarians behind him.

47:34.853 --> 47:37.105
They're going to crown him king.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.941
I'm sure his father will have
something to say about that.

47:40.025 --> 47:42.255
He plans to overthrow his father.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.748
That could go very badly for him...

47:46.831 --> 47:48.750
and for you.

47:48.833 --> 47:50.785
You shouldn't be involved.

47:50.869 --> 47:54.456
I am part of his plan.

47:54.539 --> 47:57.292
He only gets Hungary by
aligning himself with my family.

47:57.375 --> 48:01.596
- Leave him.
- It's not that easy.

48:01.680 --> 48:05.433
Call it off and come away with me.

48:05.517 --> 48:11.139
Or don't say anything
and we'll just go.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.542
As long as we're alive...

48:14.626 --> 48:16.544
he'll hunt us.

48:16.628 --> 48:18.788
And when he finds us, he'll kill us.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.178
Look at me.

48:36.514 --> 48:39.814
Do you truly want to leave with me?

48:43.788 --> 48:47.350
Yes, I do.

49:23.628 --> 49:27.515
There you are. As I predicted,
they've shut us down.

49:27.599 --> 49:31.653
Are you happy now?
You made your point.

49:31.736 --> 49:34.489
It doesn't matter that we were
sold out for the whole run!

49:34.572 --> 49:38.627
No, look. You got it off your chest.

49:38.710 --> 49:40.695
- Do we have money?
- What?

49:40.779 --> 49:43.665
- Do we have any money saved?
- Yes, we have some.

49:43.748 --> 49:46.067
But we could have had
much, much more.

49:46.151 --> 49:49.518
It will have to do.

49:51.222 --> 49:53.375
And the second account, all of it.

49:53.458 --> 49:56.450
Of course, Herr Eisenheim.

50:00.632 --> 50:02.759
Thank you.

50:56.354 --> 50:59.240
And you have no doubt
it was Duchess von Teschen?

50:59.324 --> 51:02.711
I'd stake my life on it.

51:02.794 --> 51:05.146
What was in this suitcase?

51:05.230 --> 51:07.221
I don't know.

51:17.475 --> 51:19.942
He's by the first car.

51:44.636 --> 51:47.389
The map will show you where to meet.

51:47.472 --> 51:51.660
When it's done, you'll travel ahead
with her and I shall follow.

51:51.743 --> 51:54.396
And she understands
everything this entails?

51:54.479 --> 51:59.006
Completely. There's not a lot of time.

52:29.581 --> 52:32.834
As you know, we sometimes follow...

52:32.917 --> 52:36.080
Duchess von Teschen
for her protection.

52:37.622 --> 52:40.442
Yesterday she was seen
in the company of another man.

52:40.525 --> 52:42.186
What man?

52:43.428 --> 52:45.914
Eisenheim the Illusionist.

52:45.997 --> 52:48.883
What were they doing?

52:48.967 --> 52:53.388
- Well, they were meeting and,
- Touching? Kissing?

52:53.471 --> 52:55.123
Fornicating?

52:55.206 --> 52:58.727
Not that we observed, no.

52:58.810 --> 53:02.143
However, I have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together.

53:03.648 --> 53:05.800
It's possible they may be leaving.

53:05.884 --> 53:08.536
I'm not certain of anything yet,
Your Highness.

53:08.620 --> 53:10.772
Thank you, Inspector.

53:10.855 --> 53:14.052
We can, of course, acquire more information-

53:45.256 --> 53:48.209
He spent the afternoon
in Vienna with his father.

53:48.293 --> 53:50.761
He's expected shortly.

54:22.360 --> 54:25.146
What a surprise.

54:25.230 --> 54:28.325
I thought you didn't like it here.

54:32.070 --> 54:34.800
I suppose you think
you're very clever...

54:35.941 --> 54:40.895
and very democratic
in your friendships.

54:40.979 --> 54:43.531
- Aren't you?
- What are you talking about?

54:43.615 --> 54:46.668
Your magician friend.

54:46.751 --> 54:49.049
I know you've been with him.

54:50.889 --> 54:54.676
It's true. We've been
friends since childhood.

54:54.759 --> 54:57.379
You sleep with all
your childhood friends?

54:57.462 --> 54:59.648
I will not be spoken to this way.

54:59.731 --> 55:02.252
You'll be spoken to as
I wish to speak to you!

55:02.333 --> 55:03.218
You're drunk.

55:03.301 --> 55:06.655
You're getting quite old,
aren't you?

55:06.738 --> 55:10.058
You know, my mother was 16 years old
when she married my father.

55:10.141 --> 55:13.862
And you? Can you even bear children?
Are you any use at all?

55:13.945 --> 55:17.364
- Are you trying to embarrass me?
- It has nothing to do with you.

55:17.448 --> 55:20.969
It has everything to do with me!

55:21.052 --> 55:24.351
You will not share my bed
if you've slept with him!

55:26.191 --> 55:28.785
You don't understand.

55:29.928 --> 55:32.294
I'm not going to share
your bed at all.

55:34.566 --> 55:38.420
I'm not going to Budapest with you.

55:38.503 --> 55:41.623
I don't want to be part
of what you're planning.

55:41.706 --> 55:43.901
And I will not marry you.

55:47.478 --> 55:51.066
I assume you haven't been so stupid
as to tell him anything.

55:51.149 --> 55:55.245
'Cause if you disrupt my plans, I will have
no further use for you. Do you understand?

56:02.327 --> 56:05.947
Now, you will travel
to Budapest tomorrow.

56:06.031 --> 56:10.118
I recommend that you are here early,
packed and ready to go.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.897
Do nothing more to embarrass me.

56:14.139 --> 56:16.072
Good-bye.

56:19.377 --> 56:23.006
What do you mean, "Good-bye"?
Come back here.

56:27.518 --> 56:29.714
Come back here!

56:43.034 --> 56:46.697
Don't disobey me again.
Whore!

56:54.112 --> 56:56.298
Out of my way.

56:56.381 --> 57:00.112
Please, don't.

57:26.544 --> 57:29.877
No, leave that.
Leave all the lanterns.

58:36.146 --> 58:40.668
Duchess von Teschen!

58:40.751 --> 58:43.219
Duchess von Teschen!

58:52.196 --> 58:55.653
Maybe look on that side!

58:57.835 --> 59:00.668
Over here!

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:05.252
I thought you saw her
get on the train with him.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:09.456
No, sir. We were waiting in Vienna
for them, but they left from Baden.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.859
We assumed she was with him.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.961
Should I wire
the crown prince in Budapest?

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:16.497
It's been done.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.633
- Who are you?
- I'm the family's doctor.

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:21.835
Are you the chief inspector?

01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:25.739
Yes, I am. You understand
this is a police matter now?

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:29.410
- Of course I understand.
- Good, good.

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:32.746
- You have determined the cause of death?
- She bled to death.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.749
There's a wound on her throat...

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:38.619
just above the left collarbone.

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:41.088
Perhaps from a knife or a sword.

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:43.435
May I take a look?

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.615
Inspector, I-I will
not stand for it.

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:11.318
The crown prince
will not stand for it.

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:14.666
This is not some circus sideshow.

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:18.703
My apologies, of course.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:25.573
Thank you, Doctor.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:32.906
Probably robbed.
Gypsies, maybe.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.476
Saw all those diamonds,
couldn't say no.

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:40.113
Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:43.484
- Yes, what is that?
- In the folds of her dress...

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:47.299
I found this small gemstone.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.241
Seen last Thursday at 7:30 p.m.,
riding without an escort...

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:09.243
toward the Imperial Hunting Lodge.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:12.913
Groomsman said
she arrived about 8:30.

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:14.931
What was she doing riding alone?

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.888
He did this.
You know he did.

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:22.956
- I know who did what?
- The crown prince!

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.259
He killed her. He's done it
before, and you know it.

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:28.161
No, I don't know that. In fact,
I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.509
He killed her before he left!

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:31.783
I'm afraid the facts
don't support your theory.

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:37.137
- She was leaving him.
- For who? You?

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:39.506
- Yes!
- Don't be absurd, Herr Eisenheim.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:42.776
He killed her because
he couldn't let her go.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.846
- She knew his secret.
- What secret?

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.885
- Ask your inspector. He knows-
- Stop this right now!

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:52.219
Are you completely corrupt?

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:56.390
No, not completely. No.

01:02:56.473 --> 01:03:01.495
Which is why I'll advise you not to accuse
anyone, especially His Imperial Highness.

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:03.570
Or you will end up in jail yourself.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.568
Where's the guard who
let her out of the gate?

01:03:28.649 --> 01:03:29.693
Gone with the crown prince.

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:31.862
- Did any of the servants see her leave?
- All asleep.

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:34.662
What about him?

01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:37.679
He, he put her horse
in the first stall when she arrived.

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.584
Was it this one?

01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:58.485
We don't have jurisdiction
on Imperial property.

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:00.559
Thank you.
I know.

01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:04.930
So what are you doing?

01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:09.463
Investigating.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:11.912
Listening to that magician, are you?

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:17.504
For all we know, he did it.

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:19.907
No, I think not.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.389
The crown prince is back.

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:33.220
Chief Inspector.

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:37.240
We should go. Now.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:43.030
What have you found out?

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:45.298
- She was last seen riding here, alone.
- Yes.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:48.869
And based on your information,
I then threw her out.

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:52.673
- Did she commit suicide?
- No. It was surely murder.

01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:55.817
- Do you have a suspect?
- We will soon, Your Highness.

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:07.788
Later that week, we
arrested a man and charged him with murder...

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:11.968
but I knew that
that wouldn't satisfy Eisenheim.

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:20.413
I had my men continue to watch him.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:39.453
He finally emerged from his grief
and bought a rundown theater.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.471
It's perfect.

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.730
He fired his manager...

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:53.614
and began preparing
for a new kind of show.

01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:59.132
Who is he?

01:08:00.978 --> 01:08:02.969
My name is Frankel.

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:09.203
- Where did you come from?
- I come from Brunn.

01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:11.372
My father is a lens grinder there.

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:14.390
How have you come
to be here tonight?

01:08:18.796 --> 01:08:21.959
- I don't know.
- Are you alive?

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.688
What can you tell us
about the other side?

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.723
- What's it like?
- Yes, tell us.

01:08:29.807 --> 01:08:33.127
You must know things. Secret things.

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.644
Say something spiritual.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:00.254
They don't seem
to think it's a trick.

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.862
Eisenheim.! Come out and talk to us!

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:12.032
Eisenheim's audience
had always been enthusiastic...

01:09:12.116 --> 01:09:16.951
but now he was attracting a more...
impassioned following.

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:48.216
Madame. Please?

01:09:57.061 --> 01:09:58.317
With these spirits,
these manifestations...

01:09:58.397 --> 01:10:01.714
With these spirits,
these manifestations...

01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:04.685
Eisenheim has given us hard proof...

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:07.221
of the soul's immortality.

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:10.257
The spirit has been reaffirmed...

01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:13.594
in the face of modern,
scientific materialism.

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:16.996
The work of spiritualism
will rouse humanity...

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.600
to a new, moral earnestness.

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:23.771
"It is a revolutionary movement,
and we will turn the empire...

01:10:23.854 --> 01:10:26.507
into a spiritual republic."

01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:30.686
Do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:41.954
Why must I be bothered
with a magician?

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:45.758
He is proving to be more
than a magician, Your Highness.

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:49.430
He is a charlatan.
He's a faker.

01:10:49.513 --> 01:10:53.609
He pretends to have
supernatural powers-

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:57.518
Put him on trial for fraud.

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:01.607
- First, we have to show it is fraud.
- Then do it.

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.989
Find out how the trick is done,
and then arrest him.

01:11:13.303 --> 01:11:15.788
This is just a rough demonstration,
Inspector.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.863
But you can see how it could work.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:28.810
Yes, I see.
Not bad, not bad.

01:11:32.823 --> 01:11:35.209
We need a spy in Eisenheim's troupe.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.878
Those Orientals, they won't give us anything.

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:40.987
- I already tried.
- Yeah. Then try something else.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:01.862
What has happened here?

01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:04.231
One of those ghosts from
the theater down the street.

01:13:04.315 --> 01:13:06.467
- Yes. Up there.
- Where?

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:09.570
- There.
- Right there. And it's a boy.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:12.315
- Yes. Look, look.
- Sick!

01:13:15.526 --> 01:13:18.010
- Where is this thing?
- Right there.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.188
- Over there.
- Did you see it?

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:29.323
God. An apparition. I saw it. I swear.

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:33.206
- Yes!
- Right over there.

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:26.285
Where are you taking him?

01:14:32.102 --> 01:14:35.088
I want to know how it's done.

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:37.824
First the orange tree, now this.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.494
Do I have to share all my professional
secrets with the police?

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:43.363
Well, in this case, yes,
or I'll be forced to arrest you.

01:14:43.446 --> 01:14:45.615
- On what charge?
- Oh, well, we'll start with fraud.

01:14:47.685 --> 01:14:49.703
- Excuse me, Chief Inspector-
- What?

01:14:49.787 --> 01:14:52.449
I think you should look
outside the window.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:08.264
- Who are they?
- They are here for him.

01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:14.861
My goodness, you have
a devoted following.

01:15:14.944 --> 01:15:18.532
- What is it they expect of you?
- I have no idea.

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:21.001
What do your spies tell you?

01:15:21.085 --> 01:15:24.204
That you plan to subvert
the monarchy, perhaps.

01:15:24.288 --> 01:15:28.417
Why? Just because
the crown prince is a murderer?

01:15:29.927 --> 01:15:32.846
He's not a murderer.
We have the real murderer in prison.

01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:35.215
- He pleaded guilty.
- You've got the wrong man.

01:15:35.299 --> 01:15:38.631
- You don't know that.
- No, but you do.

01:15:45.009 --> 01:15:47.861
Herr Eisenheim, you will
also go to prison...

01:15:47.945 --> 01:15:51.330
if you don't explain to me
what it is you are doing.

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:55.235
- Let him go!
- Or we will!

01:15:55.319 --> 01:15:59.306
The sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building.

01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:02.275
Eisenheim.! Eisenheim.! Eisenheim.!

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:05.953
Well?

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.317
What are you doing?
Stop!

01:16:10.401 --> 01:16:12.586
- Stop!
- Eisenheim.!

01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:14.955
There he is!

01:16:15.039 --> 01:16:17.257
Listen to me, please!

01:16:17.341 --> 01:16:21.004
You must listen to me, please!

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:27.934
Thank you all for coming. I have been
speaking with the chief inspector.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:32.681
And I think there's been
a serious misunderstanding.

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:36.810
I want you all to know...

01:16:36.894 --> 01:16:40.947
that everything that you have seen
in my theater is an illusion.

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.950
It's a trick.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:46.264
It's not real.

01:16:48.372 --> 01:16:53.160
I can't bring loved ones
back from the grave.

01:16:53.243 --> 01:16:56.212
I can't receive messages
from the other side.

01:16:57.648 --> 01:17:00.467
I apologize if I've given
you any false hope.

01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:06.489
My intention has only been
to entertain, nothing more.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:12.379
Now I appreciate your support.

01:17:12.463 --> 01:17:14.682
But you must go home.

01:17:14.765 --> 01:17:17.699
Please, you must go.

01:17:29.747 --> 01:17:33.546
There, now. I've explained it,
so it can't be fraud.

01:17:35.653 --> 01:17:37.643
May I go?

01:17:59.143 --> 01:18:01.077
Has he tricked you?
Is that it?

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:04.664
No, Your Highness.

01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:07.511
Then why are you failing me?

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.685
I thought I could trust you.

01:18:15.359 --> 01:18:19.796
I thought you were a man I could bring
with me when I took the throne.

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:25.485
- Am I wrong about you?
- No. You're not wrong, Your Highness, no.

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:30.734
I need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them!

01:18:38.382 --> 01:18:40.768
Instead, I'm surrounded by fools.

01:18:40.851 --> 01:18:44.738
In the end, I must
do everything myself.

01:18:44.822 --> 01:18:47.848
I can see this case will be no different.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:11.498
- How do I look?
- Ordinary, Your Highness.

01:19:11.582 --> 01:19:13.516
Very ordinary.

01:19:17.688 --> 01:19:20.054
I think I'm going to enjoy this.

01:19:40.544 --> 01:19:45.265
- They don't recognize you.
- Good.

01:19:45.349 --> 01:19:49.409
And keep your distance. I don't want
to be seen with a policeman.

01:21:08.899 --> 01:21:11.785
Who are you?

01:21:11.869 --> 01:21:14.421
Are you Duchess von Teschen?

01:21:14.505 --> 01:21:16.423
Yes.

01:21:16.507 --> 01:21:18.559
What's happened to you?

01:21:18.642 --> 01:21:21.405
She was murdered.
Were you murdered?

01:21:24.248 --> 01:21:26.900
By who?

01:21:26.984 --> 01:21:28.902
Did they arrest the right man?

01:21:28.986 --> 01:21:32.106
Tell us, please. Who murdered you?

01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:35.109
- Tell us.
- Someone. Here.

01:21:35.192 --> 01:21:37.911
Tell us, and point him out.

01:21:37.995 --> 01:21:39.980
Was it the crown prince?

01:21:40.064 --> 01:21:42.282
He's killed a woman before!

01:21:42.366 --> 01:21:44.517
Hey! The crown prince isn't even here.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.967
The crown prince
killed her! Something must be done!

01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.950
Chief Inspector, are you sure
you have the right man?

01:22:17.034 --> 01:22:19.919
- Quite sure. Excuse me.
- Did you investigate the crown prince?

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:21.921
He cannot continue if this is true.

01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:23.924
- He must be brought to justice.
- It's not true.

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:26.694
The magic trick is not evidence.
What is your name?

01:22:26.777 --> 01:22:30.338
- I don't see how that matters.
- I advise you to watch what you say, sir.

01:22:36.787 --> 01:22:39.973
That actress didn't even
look like Sophie.

01:22:40.057 --> 01:22:42.208
But the audience is
stupid and he knows it.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:46.479
He manipulates them.
He himself said nothing.

01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:48.481
His actress said nothing
inflammatory.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:50.818
He left it to the audience
to make their accusations.

01:22:50.901 --> 01:22:53.300
All plants paid for
by him, of course.

01:22:55.105 --> 01:22:57.223
I don't suppose you made
a note of those people?

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:59.526
I'm afraid we didn't
have enough men tonight.

01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:02.663
At the next performance,
I want them all arrested.

01:23:02.746 --> 01:23:06.132
Every one of them.
Eisenheim, the whole troupe.

01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:09.436
I want to have an example
made of him...

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.182
in front of all his followers.

01:23:15.659 --> 01:23:17.991
That was very foolish last night.

01:23:22.065 --> 01:23:24.617
You can't destroy him, you know.

01:23:24.701 --> 01:23:27.855
- You can't bring down the monarchy.
- Oh, I know I can't.

01:23:27.938 --> 01:23:30.190
Then don't raise her again.

01:23:30.274 --> 01:23:32.707
Don't provoke those questions.

01:23:37.381 --> 01:23:40.043
Eisenheim, I don't
want to arrest you.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.972
I'm a cynical man, God knows...

01:23:45.055 --> 01:23:48.042
but if your manifestations
are somehow real...

01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:51.145
then even I'm willing to admit,
you're a very special person.

01:23:51.228 --> 01:23:54.148
And if it's a trick,
then it's equally impressive.

01:23:54.231 --> 01:23:56.749
Either way, you have a gift.

01:23:56.833 --> 01:24:00.186
So don't make me put you in jail!

01:24:00.269 --> 01:24:02.489
Promise me you won't do it again.

01:24:02.573 --> 01:24:05.837
I promise you, you'll
enjoy this next show.

01:24:06.944 --> 01:24:09.829
What do you want?

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:14.282
- Nothing.
- Then why bring her back?

01:24:16.253 --> 01:24:18.244
Just to be with her.

01:24:21.024 --> 01:24:22.958
To be with her.

01:24:32.769 --> 01:24:34.687
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:24:34.771 --> 01:24:37.957
- We're trying to assess how he might escape.
- He will not escape.

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:40.601
- I want guards at every door and window!
- Sir.

01:24:48.285 --> 01:24:50.954
I want to apologize to you
for my behavior of late.

01:24:51.088 --> 01:24:53.974
But I want to make it up to you,
if you'll listen to a proposition.

01:24:54.058 --> 01:24:57.311
- Well, I don't know.
- I'll make it worth your while, Josef.

01:24:57.394 --> 01:25:00.684
You know, I'm very busy right now. I haven't
just been sitting around waiting for you.

01:25:00.764 --> 01:25:02.755
No. No, of course.

01:25:07.204 --> 01:25:10.724
I want you to assume control
of all my finances.

01:25:10.808 --> 01:25:13.227
And my assets.

01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:15.929
- Everything.
- Everything?

01:25:16.013 --> 01:25:19.166
Yes. Including this theater...

01:25:19.249 --> 01:25:21.171
and all the receipts from
tonight's performance...

01:25:21.251 --> 01:25:24.186
which I offer with
my sincere thanks.

01:25:27.691 --> 01:25:32.046
- What do you say?
- All right.

01:25:32.129 --> 01:25:35.155
- I'll do it.
- Good. Good.

01:25:36.333 --> 01:25:39.453
Would you like me
to introduce you tonight?

01:25:39.536 --> 01:25:42.369
No. Tonight, just enjoy the show.

01:26:04.828 --> 01:26:08.115
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.
I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.

01:26:08.198 --> 01:26:10.551
Yes, I remember.

01:26:10.634 --> 01:26:13.487
- What's going on? Why all the police?
- Precautions, Herr Fischer.

01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:16.256
- Precautions.
- Are you planning to arrest Eisenheim?

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.275
Oh, that's entirely up to him.

01:26:57.982 --> 01:27:00.950
There! There!

01:27:03.087 --> 01:27:05.078
It's Duchess von Teschen!

01:27:17.501 --> 01:27:20.921
Why were you murdered?

01:27:21.005 --> 01:27:23.524
- I was leaving him.
- Leaving who?

01:27:23.607 --> 01:27:26.460
- The crown prince?
- Of course it was.

01:27:26.543 --> 01:27:29.341
- We won't stand for it!
- I tried to get away.

01:27:34.184 --> 01:27:36.203
I was wearing my locket when I died.

01:27:36.286 --> 01:27:39.406
But now it's gone.
It's lost.

01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:42.309
- Tell us, please. Who murdered you?
- Was it the crown prince?

01:27:42.393 --> 01:27:44.845
We must do something!

01:27:44.928 --> 01:27:47.397
- Come along.
- We must help her!

01:27:52.936 --> 01:27:54.927
To the front!

01:27:56.273 --> 01:27:58.537
Step out!

01:28:01.679 --> 01:28:04.498
In the name of
His Imperial Majesty...

01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:09.837
and the City of Vienna,
I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz-

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.806
also known as
Eisenheim the Illusionist-

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:16.243
on charges of
disturbing public order...

01:28:16.327 --> 01:28:19.580
charlatanism and
threats against the empire!

01:28:19.663 --> 01:28:22.496
- No!
- Get back, get back!

01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:29.538
Stop it! Stop it, all of you!

01:29:25.362 --> 01:29:27.387
- He disappeared.
- Where is he?

01:29:30.867 --> 01:29:33.097
Find him!

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.699
- Where is he?
- He was right there.

01:29:45.783 --> 01:29:47.968
- How was his trick done?
- No trick.

01:29:48.052 --> 01:29:50.520
- How is it done?
- I don't know. Nobody know.

01:29:58.295 --> 01:30:00.661
Damn it!

01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:50.588
I had my driver take
the sword to police headquarters.

01:33:53.197 --> 01:33:56.383
My men will examine it and see
if it matches the gemstone...

01:33:56.467 --> 01:33:59.435
found on Duchess von Teschen's body-
I have no doubt that it will.

01:34:03.607 --> 01:34:07.094
And after that, I came in here...

01:34:07.177 --> 01:34:10.374
and you asked me why I was late.

01:34:11.448 --> 01:34:13.400
You've stolen Imperial property.

01:34:13.484 --> 01:34:15.703
That seems trivial
compared with murder.

01:34:15.786 --> 01:34:18.172
Even if that were true, you have
no jurisdiction here.

01:34:18.255 --> 01:34:22.693
That's right. You may do as you wish here,
without consequence.

01:34:23.894 --> 01:34:27.614
Nobody can punish you.

01:34:27.698 --> 01:34:29.783
- Except one man.
- Who's that?

01:34:29.867 --> 01:34:32.720
The emperor.

01:34:32.803 --> 01:34:35.772
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown
to a murderer, do you?

01:34:38.909 --> 01:34:42.243
- He'll never believe you.
- Maybe not.

01:34:46.417 --> 01:34:48.535
But, I wrote a letter
to his general staff...

01:34:48.619 --> 01:34:51.972
telling them... everything.

01:34:52.056 --> 01:34:55.309
Including your plan
to overthrow the emperor.

01:34:55.392 --> 01:34:58.579
I know they'll listen to that.

01:34:58.662 --> 01:35:01.248
You'll not take the throne-
not with my help.

01:35:01.332 --> 01:35:05.819
You no longer want to be chief of police?
Mayor of Vienna?

01:35:05.903 --> 01:35:09.531
You don't want to be
a baron, an aristocrat?

01:35:10.841 --> 01:35:13.604
I'm afraid that's out of
the question at this point.

01:35:19.049 --> 01:35:20.968
You fool.
He's tricking you.

01:35:21.051 --> 01:35:22.213
He's manipulating you.

01:35:22.294 --> 01:35:24.538
He had the sword at a
command performance.

01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:27.111
He could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here.

01:35:27.191 --> 01:35:29.109
- He has planted everything.
- You're drunk.

01:35:29.193 --> 01:35:33.857
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.

01:35:35.332 --> 01:35:38.598
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.

01:35:51.682 --> 01:35:53.967
You need to wire your driver,
and have the sword returned.

01:35:54.051 --> 01:35:55.006
Or what?

01:35:55.087 --> 01:35:57.871
I'll shoot you.
Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

01:35:57.955 --> 01:36:01.442
And then you'll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess.

01:36:01.525 --> 01:36:03.444
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.

01:36:03.527 --> 01:36:07.190
You, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.

01:36:23.314 --> 01:36:28.802
Some officers
of the general staff, I'd guess.

01:36:28.886 --> 01:36:30.876
They must have received my letter.

01:36:40.164 --> 01:36:43.917
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:48.734
Fine. Fine. You shall have nothing.

01:36:56.914 --> 01:37:00.801
- Gentlemen-
- The situation is so obvious.

01:37:00.884 --> 01:37:03.837
Everyone's completely incompetent.

01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:06.340
My father runs the empire
into the ground...

01:37:06.423 --> 01:37:08.475
and no one notices, no one
knows anything about it.

01:37:08.559 --> 01:37:11.278
I propose to clean up the mess,
and you thank me by betraying me!

01:37:11.361 --> 01:37:13.580
Well, you're all becoming irrelevant.
You will be replaced.

01:37:13.964 --> 01:37:16.985
The country will be run by mongrels!

01:37:18.068 --> 01:37:22.022
There's a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard, and nothing will be done!

01:37:22.106 --> 01:37:26.060
Nothing!
I've done everything I can.

01:37:26.143 --> 01:37:29.112
Too much!

01:37:31.315 --> 01:37:33.300
Far too much.

01:37:33.384 --> 01:37:36.603
Your Highness!
Are you in there?

01:37:36.687 --> 01:37:39.239
Your Highness, open the door.

01:37:39.323 --> 01:37:41.308
Please. Open the door.

01:37:41.392 --> 01:37:44.244
By your father's authority...

01:37:44.328 --> 01:37:47.314
I insist you open the door!

01:37:47.398 --> 01:37:49.516
You must open the door!

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.252
You're all fools.

01:37:52.336 --> 01:37:55.622
- Please, Your Highness!
- I can't stand it.

01:37:55.706 --> 01:37:59.593
I won't stand it.

01:37:59.677 --> 01:38:02.168
Break down the door. Break it down!

01:38:07.051 --> 01:38:10.850
- What happened?
- The crown prince just shot himself.

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.153
Are you Chief Inspector Uhl?

01:38:59.236 --> 01:39:01.635
I used to be.

01:39:26.230 --> 01:39:29.597
You!
Who gave you this?

01:39:31.835 --> 01:39:34.566
- Who gave you this?
- Herr Eisenheim!

01:39:35.639 --> 01:39:37.630
When?

01:39:59.495 --> 01:40:01.487
Look out!

01:41:05.162 --> 01:41:07.081
All aboard!

01:41:07.164 --> 01:41:09.688
Tickets and papers.

01:41:12.102 --> 01:41:15.196
All aboard!

01:41:43.467 --> 01:41:45.386
When it's done...

01:41:45.469 --> 01:41:47.820
you'll travel ahead
with her, and I will follow.

01:41:47.904 --> 01:41:51.291
- And she understands everything this entails?
- Completely.

01:41:51.375 --> 01:41:53.900
Do you think that
Eisenheim's behind all this?

01:41:57.447 --> 01:42:01.349
So, what does it mean, to die?

01:42:03.787 --> 01:42:07.740
- What do you want?
- To be with her.

01:42:07.824 --> 01:42:10.850
To be with her.

01:42:13.563 --> 01:42:18.557
Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.

01:42:21.772 --> 01:42:24.490
Your sword
is very beautiful. Might I see it?

01:42:24.574 --> 01:42:26.940
- You're drunk.
- You were drunk.

01:42:41.425 --> 01:42:43.744
He's a charlatan. He's a faker.

01:42:43.827 --> 01:42:46.387
He's planted everything.

01:42:57.441 --> 01:43:00.027
Everything
you have seen is an illusion.

01:43:00.110 --> 01:43:02.442
It's a trick.
