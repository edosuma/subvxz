A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:42.751 --> 00:44.127
That you, Nellie?

00:45.962 --> 00:47.589
You had another nightmare?

00:50.341 --> 00:51.176
Okay.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.762
You can sleep with me for tonight.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.310
You're really freaked out, huh?

01:01.936 --> 01:02.896
Ease up a little.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.901
Nellie?

01:08.735 --> 01:10.111
You're squeezing too tight.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.283
Nellie?

01:32.634 --> 01:33.468
Nellie?

01:45.188 --> 01:46.856
Whose hand was I holding?

02:57.343 --> 03:00.471
It was a Monday and I couldn't sleep.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.809
I went downstairs to the kitchen
to get a snack.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.314
And that's the first night I saw him.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.317
Mr. Smiley.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.944
Coming out from where he lives.

03:16.779 --> 03:17.780
And what did you do?

03:18.740 --> 03:22.744
I stayed as quiet as I could,
thinking maybe he'd just stay down there.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.496
But then I heard a creak.

03:26.122 --> 03:29.584
The stairs, the third step from the top,
it makes a sound.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.045
That's how I knew he was coming.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.838
That's how I always know.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.174
"Creak..."

03:36.883 --> 03:39.469
Then my door knob,
then he's in my room.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.263
What does Mr. Smiley look like?

03:42.847 --> 03:44.057
Just a big smile.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.099
Too big.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.102
He's always smiling, but he isn't happy.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.606
That's really scary.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.028
You said something about
where he lives?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.365
Where does Mr. Smiley live, Kelsey?

04:03.993 --> 04:05.161
Under the house.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.038
In the basement?

04:21.010 --> 04:21.844
You know...

04:22.845 --> 04:24.639
you're a lot like me, Kelsey.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.474
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.603
See, when I was little,
I was afraid of a lot of things.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.522
I didn't have to be, though.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.817
They were all in my head.
I just didn't know that yet.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.319
But when I was scared,

04:38.403 --> 04:40.488
I would imagine myself building...

04:40.613 --> 04:42.156
a big wall all around me

04:42.240 --> 04:45.493
made of the strongest bricks
in the whole world.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.413
And when I got scared...

04:49.289 --> 04:52.083
I would imagine myself putting
another one on, one after the other

04:52.166 --> 04:54.002
until that wall was so thick

04:54.085 --> 04:55.795
and so strong...

04:55.878 --> 04:58.047
I knew I'd be safe in there forever.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.883
And that's what you do too, right?

05:01.759 --> 05:02.719
It's okay.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.512
It's good.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.806
'Cause kids like us

05:06.973 --> 05:09.225
have been through more
than other kids.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.145
We're tougher than other kids.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.356
We're great builders.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.693
We make ourselves really safe.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.363
And no one ever gets in.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.575
Mr. Smiley does.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.330
Our other two foster kids are thriving.
We just want the same for her.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.709
She was telling me about Mr. Smiley.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.962
Yeah, yeah, we've heard about him too.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.299
We're more concerned about
her behavioral problems at school.

05:42.133 --> 05:46.804
You can see her grades started out fine.
At least, considering.

05:47.805 --> 05:48.931
But then...

05:49.349 --> 05:50.308
Well, you'll see.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.020
All our kids have always had to go through
an adjustment,

05:54.604 --> 05:56.356
-but this...
-Could be normal.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.692
The foster care system
isn't the easiest place to grow up.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.324
And the Mr. Smiley thing,
did that start right away, or...

06:06.532 --> 06:08.534
A few weeks after she moved in.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.412
And her behavioral issues started
around the same time.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.581
We'll get to the bottom of it.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.541
Same time next week?

06:16.084 --> 06:16.918
Yeah.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.503
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

06:19.003 --> 06:19.837
Thanks.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.416
Trash.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.918
Nellie crawls into our bed sometimes.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.294
She says it wasn't her.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.505
I guess it was just a weird dream.

07:03.631 --> 07:07.927
Most of the stuff is going to be junk,
but anything fancy, we can sell it.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.138
Trash.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.186
Hang on.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.480
This is...

07:20.398 --> 07:21.274
fancy.

07:23.067 --> 07:23.901
Yeah?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.830
'49 Clos de Bia.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.540
Damn.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.125
This is quite...

07:42.753 --> 07:45.339
-How did you know that?
-Mm-mm.

07:51.554 --> 07:55.349
You, you really don't feel that?
-I'm sorry, I don't.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.936
We must look like
we're crazy, huh?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.855
Hi, Mrs. Dudley.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.023
Theodora.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.275
Well, you tell me if I am.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.490
Do you feel cold right there?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.408
-Yep.
-I told you.

08:13.075 --> 08:13.993
My apologies.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.662
No, it's a very small spot,
just right here,

08:16.746 --> 08:19.081
like you're standing in front
of an open refrigerator.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.416
But if you move...

08:21.918 --> 08:22.919
See?

08:23.753 --> 08:24.670
What about there?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.255
Yep. Here too.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.381
You sure?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.591
I don't feel it here.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.593
This whole house is cold.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.389
That doesn't exactly clear
things up, does it, Clara?

08:35.473 --> 08:37.391
-No, ma'am.
-Come upstairs.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.602
There's another spot in the second master.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.446
You're out of mustard
and you're almost out of turkey.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.157
You know there are people you can
actually pay to make you lunch.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.826
Some of them even deliver it
right to your office.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.037
Save you driving over here every day.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.540
I like the drive.
It gives me time to think.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.999
And the food's better at home.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.709
If it's shopping you don't like,

09:03.793 --> 09:05.711
you could always find
someone to go with you.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.755
Someone like that girl from last night.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.006
And give up all this?

09:17.348 --> 09:18.182
How's work?

09:20.476 --> 09:21.727
It was a tough one today.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.688
This little girl.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.774
I couldn't get anything from her.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.151
You always figure out how to help.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.736
You're so good with them.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.699
This one, she's tough.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.326
She's like a brick wall.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.162
I know the type.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.878
Do you see anything?

09:47.962 --> 09:49.714
Nope. Just dark.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.674
MaybeÂ you send messages through it.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.092
What'd you find?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.344
Don't know.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.763
Here. Let me see.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.062
-Hmm.
-What?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.355
It's like a...

10:06.731 --> 10:07.565
telephone...

10:08.232 --> 10:10.026
but for inside the house.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.653
Here, Nellie, you stay there.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.696
Come on.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.075
That's the other end.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.578
Ugh, what is that smell?

10:20.661 --> 10:21.662
What smell?

10:22.371 --> 10:24.123
You can't smell that?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.375
It smells the same in here
as the rest of the house.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.924
This was a sickbed.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.760
How do you know?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.094
Hello!

10:37.178 --> 10:41.015
Hello, can you hear me?
This is Eleanor Crain calling.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.184
I can hear you, Nellie.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.269
You guys have fun.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.814
You have to say your name
so I know it's really you.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.067
Ugh, Luke Crain!

10:52.151 --> 10:55.404
If you're really Luke,
what's your favorite kind of pudding?

10:55.571 --> 10:57.031
Um, rice?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.867
No, it's chocolate
vanilla chocolate.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.078
No, it's rice now.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.914
You need to tell me
things like this, Luke.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.750
-I am telling you.
-Hello!

11:07.833 --> 11:09.085
Hello.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.588
I'm Theodora, but I like my friends
to call me Theo.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.298
Will you call me Theo?

11:16.550 --> 11:17.677
Hi, Theo.

11:23.265 --> 11:26.727
PTSD SOCIAL ANXIETY

11:49.458 --> 11:51.168
It wasn't exactly easy to hear but,

11:51.252 --> 11:52.420
Shirley...

11:52.545 --> 11:54.422
hit on some things
that have been nagging at me.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.966
And, well, you were right.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.552
I was trying to take ownership
of something

11:59.635 --> 12:01.220
that doesn't belong just to me.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.680
So you're pulling the book?

12:03.347 --> 12:05.057
I'm offering to share the book.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.185
I'll give each of you eight percent
of any royalties,

12:08.269 --> 12:10.396
and if it sells as well
as my publisher thinks it will--

12:10.479 --> 12:11.313
Jesus, Steve.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.649
-I'm trying to do the right thing.
-The right thing?

12:13.733 --> 12:16.485
What, is the guilt getting
in the way of your new lifestyle?

12:16.569 --> 12:20.406
You and Leigh feeling awkward
while you pack up for California?

12:20.489 --> 12:22.742
Whatever. This could be
a significant amount of--

12:22.825 --> 12:23.743
Whatever?

12:23.993 --> 12:25.995
It's all about the money for you.
We're well aware.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.288
Of course it's about the money.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.832
-I mean, you guys have read it, right?
-I haven't.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.001
Why bother?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.628
I've heard the various versions
my whole life.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.589
I've heard Dad's tabloid horror show,

12:36.672 --> 12:38.340
I've heard Luke and Nellie's
ghost stories.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.633
-No offense, Nellie.
-Okay.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.429
I've heard you and Steven
do your best James Randi impression

12:43.512 --> 12:45.931
where you say
how crazy everybody was.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.392
Just, maybe it's a middle child thing,
but I just

12:48.476 --> 12:51.145
would rather focus on living
my actual life...

12:51.520 --> 12:52.480
right now.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.192
Maybe I'll just wait for the paperback.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.572
We're not taking your money.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.033
None of us.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.576
It's blood money, Steve.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.704
You're welcome to every red cent.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.541
-Right?
-Yup.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.877
-Blood money.
-Right.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.455
Hello?

14:26.156 --> 14:27.491
You're not funny, Luke.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.323
Hey, can I get a water

15:42.191 --> 15:45.819
-What do you think you're doing?
-I was just giving my truck a ride.

15:45.903 --> 15:46.862
What's up?

15:47.529 --> 15:49.239
Your little brother was getting
into trouble.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.783
Want to let go of his arm?

15:52.826 --> 15:55.412
He's playing, Mrs. Dudley.
Why are you yelling at him?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.957
Because the dumbwaiter is not a toy,
it can be dangerous.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.708
That's all you need to say, then.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.168
Fair enough.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.255
Come along.
I need to clean the kitchen.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.257
You don't have to be so mean about it.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.802
She's not mean.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.514
She's scared.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.892
What makes you say that?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.544
Luke?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.424
I thought it might be her.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.384
Mrs. Dudley?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.219
She never stays after dark.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.263
What are you doing?

17:36.346 --> 17:39.099
Trying to take a ride in this elevator.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.267
Dumbwaiter.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.897
Come on, you stupid thing.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.356
The door has to be closed.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.567
But then I can't reach the buttons.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.819
You're a crazy kid, you know that?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.363
Just one ride? I know it works.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.823
Please, Theo?

17:54.907 --> 17:57.201
-I'm gonna get in trouble.
-I won't tell.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.161
Please, come on.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.789
It's a perfect kid's-size elevator.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.127
Fine, but you'll hop straight out

18:07.211 --> 18:09.630
and you don't tell anyone
I did this for you, okay?

18:09.713 --> 18:10.881
Okay.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.343
You ready?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.136
Going up.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.390
Hey! Up!Â Theo!

18:21.517 --> 18:22.893
Luke!

18:23.227 --> 18:24.061
Shit.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.772
-Theo!
-Luke!

18:28.482 --> 18:30.859
Theo!

18:38.700 --> 18:39.701
Luke?

18:40.577 --> 18:42.329
There's a room down here.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.626
There's a ladder down here on the wall.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.753
You can come get me.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.046
Just hang on.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.096
Bring me up, please.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.112
There's something down here.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.030
Just hang on. I'm trying.

19:17.906 --> 19:18.740
Come on.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.203
Theo!

19:26.915 --> 19:28.709
Luke!

19:33.172 --> 19:35.007
-Luke!

19:35.424 --> 19:36.550
What the hell!

19:36.633 --> 19:37.634
Luke?

19:37.926 --> 19:38.886
-Help!
-Luke?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.554
Is he in the--?
Jesus!

19:40.637 --> 19:41.638
Hang on.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.850
-Let's get him up.
-Hang on.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.810
-Hang on.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.729
It's okay, baby,
we're right here.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.109
There we go.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.029
Okay.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.739
Okay, it's okay.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.533
-Let's see. Here we go.
-It's okay.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.828
What happened?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.206
Did you rip your shirt?
Must have got caught on the door.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.709
Something grabbed me! Monster!
It was a monster!

20:10.792 --> 20:12.502
-What the hell were you thinking?
-It's okay.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.712
Is he okay?

20:13.795 --> 20:14.880
Go to your room.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.549
Come here.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.219
Let me see, honey.
Let's see what happened.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.137
Okay, there's no scrapes.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.055
Okay?

20:23.138 --> 20:25.599
You're okay. Yeah, so scary, huh?

20:26.391 --> 20:27.643
You all right?

21:14.982 --> 21:15.816
Jesus.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.742
You really got in my head, girl.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.460
I'm sorry.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.504
It's...

21:39.006 --> 21:39.965
um...

21:42.718 --> 21:43.552
Nell.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.524
I'm just saying a modest dowry,
nothing ostentatious.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.278
Not enough I support you
for, what, six years?

22:01.361 --> 22:03.196
You also wish you got a cow?

22:03.947 --> 22:05.949
Or a llama. Something.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.576
-Hey.
-Hi.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.494
Did you find them?
The toasts are supposed--

22:09.578 --> 22:10.662
I know, I'm still looking.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.332
-They were supposed to be 10 minutes ago.
-I know, I need Stacy.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.292
I'll check the bar.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.918
Okay. Thanks.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.548
-Hi.
-Honey.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.092
-Hey. Did you find her?
-No, she's not out front.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.679
-Yeah, I'm still missing two groomsmen.
-Oh my God.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.181
-I'm gonna check the kitchen.
-Okay.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.265
-All right?
-Okay.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.475
Okay.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.684
-Okay
-Okay.

22:33.810 --> 22:34.770
Really?

22:35.479 --> 22:36.813
I looked at the bar.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.773
Yeah.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.485
Great. It's toast time
and my maid of honor is MIA.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.072
You don't have to help me.
I'll find her.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.949
Beats the cold shoulder
from Shirley.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.202
That table's getting tense.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.580
Stacey

22:55.207 --> 22:56.041
No.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.091
Yeah.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.427
Stacey!

23:10.097 --> 23:11.431
Yeah, just a sec.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.227
That's the thing about weddings.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.105
Hey.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.981
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

23:20.273 --> 23:23.026
Toasts were supposed to be
ten minutes ago.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.445
-I'm sorry. I'm ready.
-It's okay, come on.

23:25.529 --> 23:28.698
-Might want to check your makeup.
-No, it's fine. You'll be fine.

23:30.617 --> 23:31.451
You coming?

23:32.953 --> 23:34.413
I want to see who's in there.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.290
It's gotta be Henry.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.167
My money's on Matt.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.253
-He collects bridesmaids.
-No.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.088
You want to put some money on it?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.350
Hey.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.104
What?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.733
-Nothing.
-I mean...

24:03.817 --> 24:04.818
I mean...

24:05.110 --> 24:06.194
I mean, we didn't...

24:07.279 --> 24:10.073
We didn't know you were into...

24:11.825 --> 24:12.659
Bridesmaids?

24:20.959 --> 24:21.918
I love you.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.341
-Can you get my dress?
-Yes

24:28.967 --> 24:31.386
I'm sorry to bring this up
again, but...

24:31.970 --> 24:33.972
why the hell would she go to that house?

24:36.349 --> 24:38.768
My kids are going to ask me how she died.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.730
And you'll tell them.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.106
Tell them what?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.066
She killed herself?

24:46.860 --> 24:49.905
-Aunt Nellie killed herself?
-Yes, that's better than lying.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.617
Or saying nothing, like Dad did.

24:56.578 --> 24:57.829
What do I say?

25:02.876 --> 25:04.836
You answer the question that's asked.

25:07.380 --> 25:10.634
Don't elaborate, don't offer information
that's not requested.

25:10.717 --> 25:11.927
Just tell them that...

25:13.970 --> 25:16.515
that their feelings are correct
and they're safe.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.935
And it's okay to be curious.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.063
And sad.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.399
Tell them you're sad, too.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.238
And if they ask why?

25:33.156 --> 25:34.407
Tell them you don't know.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.201
No one knows.

25:36.868 --> 25:37.702
That's okay.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.750
Better they ask you than me.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.296
Why?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.257
Because I'm fucking angry.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.181
Because I don't want to have to tell them
that I'm fucking pissed at Auntie Nell

25:58.265 --> 26:00.767
who should have known better,
better than most...

26:01.268 --> 26:03.103
what this does to a family.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.440
She fucking knew better.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.443
And she did it anyway.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.038
I gotta go.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.375
Sorry, I just-- I can't, Shirl.

26:52.652 --> 26:53.612
Hey.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.155
Can I come in?

27:02.370 --> 27:03.371
I like your drawing.

27:04.998 --> 27:05.915
Listen...

27:06.541 --> 27:07.709
I'm sorry, okay?

27:08.585 --> 27:09.836
It's okay.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.297
Mom and Dad are still mad at me.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.549
They don't believe me.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.677
-About what?
-Anything.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.763
I'm sorry.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.807
First they said Abigail is not real.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.144
Now they said the basement's not real.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.896
It's not in the blueprints.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.191
They said it's probably
just a crawl space.

27:32.275 --> 27:36.029
And whatever was down there,
they definitely don't believe me.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.239
Nobody ever believes me.

27:44.746 --> 27:45.747
I believe you.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.378
Maybe we can prove it to them.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.090
You said something about a ladder
when you were down there.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.344
So pretend you're the dumbwaiter.

27:59.719 --> 28:00.553
Where was it?

28:01.971 --> 28:02.931
Okay, so...

28:03.640 --> 28:05.392
Was it this far away?

28:05.975 --> 28:06.893
A little more.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.311
Was it...

28:09.562 --> 28:10.522
this far away?

28:13.650 --> 28:14.484
Okay.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.153
One, two, three,

28:17.320 --> 28:21.116
four, five, six, seven,

28:21.199 --> 28:24.536
eight, nine, ten...

28:25.245 --> 28:26.246
eleven.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.722
You were so scared.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.265
Oh. Hi.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.101
I'm so sorry to just drop in
on you like this.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.813
-If I'm interrupting, I can--
-No, it's fine.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.648
Please, come in.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.737
I was just in the neighborhood
and I needed something to...

31:47.280 --> 31:48.197
Is Kelsey here?

31:49.282 --> 31:51.701
No, she's at school right now.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.995
All the kids are at school.

31:54.871 --> 31:55.705
Of course.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.375
I didn't realize you made house calls.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.339
I don't, normally.

32:04.422 --> 32:07.091
I was just out and about
and thinking about your case.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.971
This is going to sound
really strange, but...

32:12.847 --> 32:15.808
would you mind if I took a quick look
down in your basement?

32:21.064 --> 32:23.232
Uh, give us a shout if you need anything.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.401
-I'm about to go back to work.
-Okay.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.111
Thank you.

34:35.448 --> 34:36.908
No.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.618
No.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.536
Please! No.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.136
-You all done?
-Yeah.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.597
I really appreciate you indulging me
like this. I...

35:41.681 --> 35:44.350
was hoping I could get into Kelsey's
headspace just a bit,

35:44.433 --> 35:47.103
you know, try to understand her better.
But,Â well...

35:48.146 --> 35:49.522
It's just a normal basement.

35:49.605 --> 35:50.940
That's what we keep telling her.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.859
I'll dive back in with her this week.

35:52.942 --> 35:53.860
Thank you.

35:59.699 --> 36:00.533
Thanks.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.374
What are you...

36:09.125 --> 36:10.835
um... looking at?

36:13.045 --> 36:13.921
Your smile.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.636
That's right.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.723
And Social Services, too.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.602
You just have to trust me on this.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.105
I haven't been wrong before, have I?

36:33.274 --> 36:34.442
Yes, I'm sure.

36:34.775 --> 36:37.111
And I'm sure the guy will confess
if you just--

36:39.572 --> 36:40.531
Just get them here.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.118
No, I'm going to wait for the cops.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.288
Okay.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.291
Thanks, Gina. Bye.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.975
You found this.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.729
It was in this little room,
off to the side.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.232
There were a bunch of books like it.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.318
It's a book of secrets
that they were trying to hide.

37:18.736 --> 37:19.779
How do you figure that?

37:21.197 --> 37:22.156
I don't know.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.826
I could tell when I picked it up.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.456
Like you could tell there's a false floor
in the pantry?

37:33.876 --> 37:34.794
It's a ledger.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.338
For a bootlegging operation.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.090
You know what that is?

37:40.841 --> 37:43.803
A long time ago,
it was illegal to sell alcohol,

37:44.095 --> 37:46.013
so they made it in secret and hid it.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.809
You know, there's not a single record
of this basement.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.103
It's not on any of the blueprints.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.563
They didn't want anyone to find it.

37:55.231 --> 37:56.065
But you did.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.195
I really, really don't like that you
went down there by yourself.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.572
I just wanted to show you
that Luke was right.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.950
But I love that you're so brave.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.546
Honey?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.632
Honey...

38:21.799 --> 38:22.800
what's wrong?

39:24.862 --> 39:26.447
Would you look at that.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.533
They must've dug it right out of the wall.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.161
How the hell did she find this?

39:32.703 --> 39:33.871
No idea.

39:34.705 --> 39:35.664
It's amazing.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.751
I can't expect it's up to code.

39:40.252 --> 39:42.463
I'll call Peter to bring
some guys tomorrow.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.259
Come here, my love.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.020
You know, your dad was telling me a story,

39:58.104 --> 39:59.271
about the wine...

39:59.355 --> 40:01.899
you found
when you were cleaning up the cupboard.

40:02.608 --> 40:03.442
How'd you know?

40:04.735 --> 40:05.653
I just guessed.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.782
Like you guessed about the ledger?

40:14.537 --> 40:16.414
You know those headaches I get sometimes?

40:17.665 --> 40:19.500
They started when I was a little girl.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.753
And when I get them... uh,

40:23.129 --> 40:24.713
I see all sorts of...

40:27.174 --> 40:28.092
Well.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.053
Your grandmother was like that, too.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.139
She was...

40:33.848 --> 40:34.723
sensitive.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.186
I've wondered if you and your sisters
might be a little sensitive.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.774
Shirley says some things sometimes
when she's sleeping that are...

40:45.151 --> 40:46.569
Well, they're interesting.

40:47.653 --> 40:51.115
And I asked Nellie what she thought about
the house when we moved in.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.075
She said it was loud.

40:54.368 --> 40:56.704
Such an odd word she chose.

40:58.330 --> 41:01.709
I noticed you always wear sweaters inside,
even though it's summer.

41:02.877 --> 41:03.794
Why is that?

41:04.670 --> 41:05.921
'Cause it's always cold.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.508
Grandma Mary was like that, too.

41:10.968 --> 41:14.305
She hated the air on her skin.
She was always bundled up.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.767
Sensitive people...

41:18.976 --> 41:20.519
they sometimes need...

41:22.813 --> 41:23.647
Well.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.865
These will help with the cold.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.035
And the other thing.

41:43.542 --> 41:44.668
Does Dad know?

41:46.003 --> 41:47.171
That you're sensitive?

41:47.588 --> 41:48.422
Kind of.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.927
We'll talk a lot more about it
as you get older.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.346
But in the meantime...

41:56.764 --> 41:59.683
if you're feeling overwhelmed
and you think nobody will understand,

41:59.767 --> 42:01.227
you can talk to me.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.521
About anything.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.273
Okay?

42:17.701 --> 42:21.121
THEODORA CRAIN
$15,000

42:24.458 --> 42:25.376
Thanks.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.836
You're not scared Shirley's
going to kill you for this?

42:28.128 --> 42:29.505
I'm pretty good at secrets.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.549
I know.

42:32.132 --> 42:33.801
You sure you don't want to stay
for dinner?

42:34.301 --> 42:35.678
No, but thank you.

42:37.846 --> 42:38.889
Have a good trip.

42:42.351 --> 42:43.435
Hit the beach for me.

42:45.187 --> 42:46.188
No hug?

42:58.158 --> 43:00.703
You got a couple things wrong in there,
by the way.

43:02.371 --> 43:03.539
So you finally read it.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.667
You said it was Luke that I found
the old bootlegging basement.

43:07.876 --> 43:08.711
That was me.

43:09.044 --> 43:09.920
Oh.

43:12.047 --> 43:13.257
Sorry about that.

43:13.757 --> 43:14.800
Anything else?

43:15.551 --> 43:19.430
You know, I was pretty impressed
by what you wrote about that night.

43:19.513 --> 43:20.556
What night?

43:21.348 --> 43:22.266
That night.

43:22.850 --> 43:23.809
The last one.

43:24.643 --> 43:25.477
Uh-huh?

43:25.561 --> 43:27.479
-That's some wild stuff in there.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.692
That was really wild stuff considering
that you were asleep for, what, like...

43:32.234 --> 43:33.611
ninety-nine percent of it?

43:41.452 --> 43:43.329
So what are you going to do
with the money?

43:43.412 --> 43:45.414
Car Travel?

43:47.041 --> 43:47.875
No.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.545
I'm gonna get my fucking PhD.

45:19.967 --> 45:21.260
Jesus wept.

46:55.771 --> 46:56.605
Hey.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.106
Hey.

46:59.775 --> 47:00.984
Uh.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.529
I thought I heard somebody down here.

47:03.612 --> 47:04.613
Sorry to wake you.

47:06.448 --> 47:07.324
You okay?

47:08.116 --> 47:09.159
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:09.576 --> 47:11.703
You sure? You look, uh...

47:12.412 --> 47:13.956
Shirley found your checkbook.

47:14.665 --> 47:15.541
Hmm?

47:15.624 --> 47:16.959
Individual account.

47:18.085 --> 47:19.044
Oh.

47:20.712 --> 47:22.297
You're not going to tell her,
are you?

47:22.923 --> 47:26.009
I mean, it's just as bad for you
as it is for me.

47:28.470 --> 47:29.346
Of course not.

47:30.764 --> 47:33.016
You might want to come up
with an excuse, though.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.186
Make up a mistress, something.

47:36.562 --> 47:37.437
Secret family.

47:40.732 --> 47:44.111
You know, something that's gonna
piss her off less than the truth.

47:55.289 --> 47:57.416
Whoa. Hang on.

48:00.377 --> 48:01.420
Are you okay?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.171
Yeah, just...

48:03.297 --> 48:05.090
we barely said two words
to each other.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.051
-Can we take a second and talk?

48:14.474 --> 48:17.227
Hey, believe me,
I'm thrilled you called me.

48:17.853 --> 48:20.105
I just feel kind of weird about
how I left the other night,

48:20.188 --> 48:22.649
and then last night at the club
you completely ignored me.

48:22.733 --> 48:23.567
Yeah.

48:28.030 --> 48:29.197
Yeah.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.704
I'm sorry about that.

48:39.791 --> 48:41.627
Is that what you want to talk about?

48:43.337 --> 48:44.922
Well, not exclusively.

48:45.672 --> 48:48.175
I mean, I don't know,
what do people usually talk about?

48:49.259 --> 48:51.637
How are you Stuff like that.

48:53.847 --> 48:55.641
Well, let's see, my day.

48:56.558 --> 48:58.727
I found out that a nine-year-old...

48:59.061 --> 49:00.187
that I was treating...

49:00.646 --> 49:02.648
was getting molested
by her foster dad.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.737
And she buried it so deep
she had to make up a monster

49:08.820 --> 49:10.697
just to compartmentalize and cope.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.786
And she did such a good job
that she planted him right in my head.

49:19.373 --> 49:22.834
Guy folded like a cheap suit the moment
he was questioned by the cops, so...

49:23.418 --> 49:24.294
Yay.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.632
But that just means the girl
goes back in the system,

49:28.715 --> 49:30.217
so it's a gamble at best.

49:31.051 --> 49:32.386
So, you know...

49:34.346 --> 49:35.764
good job, me.

49:39.977 --> 49:40.936
And this kid...

49:42.771 --> 49:44.898
she built up so many emotional walls.

49:48.276 --> 49:50.237
I touched her hands
and I didn't even...

49:56.243 --> 49:59.454
She just needed help
and no one was listening.

50:05.544 --> 50:07.587
And it's so much like Nellie.

50:12.634 --> 50:13.552
So...

50:14.845 --> 50:17.931
should we talk about your day
or would you rather come to bed?

50:52.215 --> 50:53.216
Theo!

50:54.217 --> 50:56.011
I need you to get Luke
and Nell to the car.

50:56.094 --> 50:58.930
You get in, lock the doors, don't unlock
until you see me come outside.

50:59.014 --> 51:00.682
Do you understand

51:00.766 --> 51:03.018
Get them to the car.
I need to get Steve and Shirl.

51:03.101 --> 51:04.978
What's happening?

51:05.103 --> 51:06.021
Go.

51:06.980 --> 51:07.814
Come on.

51:10.317 --> 51:11.443
Come on.

51:14.112 --> 51:15.280
Daddy!

51:16.073 --> 51:17.991
-Stop!

51:18.617 --> 51:19.493
Let go!

51:19.910 --> 51:22.329
Let go of me!Â Let go!

51:22.412 --> 51:23.455
Don't touch me!

51:24.372 --> 51:25.874
Don't touch me!

51:27.501 --> 51:28.960
Don't touch me!

51:29.878 --> 51:30.754
Touch me.
