00:04.537 --> 00:07.631
<i>Surgeons are all messed up.</i>
<i>We're butchers.</i>

00:07.674 --> 00:10.666
<i>Messed up, knife-happy butchers.</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:25.586
Sir? Would you like a cot
set up for you in her room?

00:25.658 --> 00:28.058
<i>We cut people up. We move on.</i>

00:28.094 --> 00:30.961
<i>Patients die on our watch.</i>
<i>We move on.</i>

00:30.997 --> 00:33.363
No. I'm a doctor here.

00:35.268 --> 00:38.203
<i>We cause trauma.</i>
<i>We suffer trauma.</i>

00:43.676 --> 00:45.735
Wait.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.612
And here it comes.

00:56.589 --> 01:00.753
<i>We don't have time to worry</i>
<i>about how blood and death makes us feel.</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:03.021
This is how you unwind?

01:03.063 --> 01:07.363
By watching two hours straight
of advanced carotid endarterectomy?

01:08.468 --> 01:10.459
Cristina?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.885
Everything OK?

02:07.927 --> 02:10.919
Cristina? Owen!

02:16.669 --> 02:21.470
What...? What?

02:32.886 --> 02:38.017
It's three in the morning, Cristina.
This better be...

02:38.057 --> 02:39.649
Callie?

02:42.529 --> 02:43.587
What?

02:44.063 --> 02:45.155
He what?

02:45.198 --> 02:49.362
It's me. Cristina!

02:55.542 --> 02:57.737
What's going on?
Owen's out there upset,

02:57.777 --> 03:00.575
- Callie was screaming...
- No changes in visual acuity.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.946
No petechiae. I'm fine.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.713
Oh, my God! Your neck!
I will kill him!

03:06.753 --> 03:08.516
No, no, no. He had a nightmare.

03:08.555 --> 03:11.854
Cristina, please.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.894
Is she all right? I just
need to know that she's all right.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.761
No, no, no. Cristina, no.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.327
I am so sorry.

03:26.839 --> 03:31.208
I don't know what happened.
I don't know what happened.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.143
- I'm sorry.
- Look at me.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.512
- I'm sorry.
- Look at me.

03:38.851 --> 03:42.787
I'm fine. See?
It's OK. You were asleep.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.882
It's OK. OK? It's OK. It's OK.

03:45.925 --> 03:49.725
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK. I know.

03:52.031 --> 03:56.365
It's OK. You were asleep.
It's OK. OK? It's OK.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.768
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.620
There's coffee.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.928
No. Not like this.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.405
Today's your first day back at
the hospital. Today's about Izzie.

04:37.443 --> 04:41.641
You have to operate on her brain.
You have a gift.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.878
And you can do this.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.449
I'm gonna shower before I go in.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.463
You're wearing a turtleneck
under your scrubs.

05:04.504 --> 05:05.528
It's ugly.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.604
Not as ugly as the fact
that you hugged him.

05:09.208 --> 05:12.268
- You hugged him...
- I get it. I hear you. Move on.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.406
Turtlenecks aren't OK.
You're not OK. Your boyfriend is not OK.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.882
- Is your boyfriend OK?
- What?

05:17.917 --> 05:20.909
To be cutting into brains today.
Is he OK to be back?

05:20.953 --> 05:22.978
Yes. Of course. Derek is fine.

05:23.022 --> 05:27.322
I was there for his carnage in the OR,
remember? This isn't just any patient.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.225
This is Izzie.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.030
George, hey.
I'm surprised you're not...

05:42.075 --> 05:45.044
Isn't there a presentation
happening with Izzie?

05:45.078 --> 05:48.570
I didn't know she was sick.
Bailey told me after Cristina told her.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.310
Izzie trusted Cristina.
I was the very last to know.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.377
- I'm sure Izzie wasn't trying...
- I don't want to talk about it.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.150
I want to work.
Do you have any room on your service?

05:57.190 --> 06:00.956
- Yeah. Three hip replacements...
- Thank you.

06:06.632 --> 06:10.363
You three. I understand why you're here.
You want to help.

06:10.403 --> 06:14.430
I will be the resident on her case.
I will be prepping her for surgery.

06:14.474 --> 06:18.342
If you're going into that hospital room,
you will do so as her friends.

06:18.378 --> 06:22.007
Izzie needs her people around her
to tell her everything will be fine.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.449
She needs you to hold her hand. She
needs you, not more doctors. Understood?

06:31.824 --> 06:33.382
Great. Let's get started.

06:33.426 --> 06:37.226
As you know, you have
stage-four metastatic melanoma.

06:37.263 --> 06:41.290
We have surgeries and procedures lined
up for you over the next few weeks.

06:41.367 --> 06:44.598
We've seen mets on your liver,
so one of those surgeries,

06:44.637 --> 06:49.040
Dr. Bailey and I will resect them.
We also lined up Dr. Parker from OB

06:49.075 --> 06:53.444
to harvest as many healthy eggs as she
can before you undergo any radiation.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.913
- Right. Babies.
- Leaving the option open,

06:55.948 --> 06:57.711
- if you want it.
- But our priority

06:57.750 --> 07:00.878
is to address mets in your brain.
I'm surprised we didn't catch it.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.821
It causes headaches,
seizures, hallucinations.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.723
Hopefully the lesion has clear margins
and I can remove it.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.249
Are you people done?

07:10.096 --> 07:13.657
Over the next four weeks,
you're slated for three major surgeries,

07:13.733 --> 07:16.964
seven outpatient procedures,
just for mets we've found.

07:17.003 --> 07:20.905
In all likelihood, we will find more.
We may have to cut into you more.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.965
You may as well get used
to the idea now.

07:23.042 --> 07:27.035
I'll be administering your radiation,
chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.947
The treatment will be aggressive,
it will be harsh. Prepare yourself.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.578
I'll be overseeing procedures,
including today's,

07:34.620 --> 07:39.557
which means every surgeon in this room
now answers to me.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.091
Welcome to the cancer wing, folks.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.499
See you in the OR.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.268
Thanks.

07:57.610 --> 08:01.239
Seriously, don't just stand there
staring at me. It's making me nervous.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.681
- Get out of here. Go save lives.
- Yeah, we have rounds.

08:04.717 --> 08:07.379
- Yeah.
- OK. See you later.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.864
Karev, I just reviewed
Izzie's most recent MRl.

08:27.907 --> 08:31.104
Doesn't look like the tumor
has grown since her last scans.

08:31.143 --> 08:35.977
Do you have concerns you'd like to
discuss with me before we brief Izzie?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.813
Just try keeping her frontal lobe
inside her skull this time.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.081
Good morning, Izzie.

08:46.125 --> 08:50.152
- You coming?
- No. I'm on this old lady, so...

08:50.196 --> 08:52.960
- This'll only take a minute.
- I gotta go, really.

08:55.268 --> 08:59.932
Hi, Dr. Sloan. These are Aunt Joyce's
nephews, my brothers Tobin and Luke.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.702
They flew in early this morning.
Dr. Sloan did the surgery.

09:02.742 --> 09:06.576
I'm sorry. Your aunt is very sick.
There's not much more we can do for her.

09:06.612 --> 09:11.174
- Probably time to say your goodbyes.
- Do you mean say our goodbyes now

09:11.217 --> 09:13.742
or sometime in the next 24 hours?

09:13.786 --> 09:16.687
I mean, what kind of time frame
are we talking about?

09:16.722 --> 09:21.216
- Twenty-four hours seems unlikely.
- You sure?

09:21.294 --> 09:23.694
Because I have a flight
to catch in the morning,

09:23.729 --> 09:29.099
and if I wait past noon,
I can't change it.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.799
I need to be on a plane tonight.
Board meeting tomorrow.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.774
So do you think she'll die
before tomorrow?

09:40.746 --> 09:43.874
You really think Shepherd's the guy
for Steven's surgery today?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.510
- Someone else in mind?
- Shepherd wouldn't be my choice,

09:46.552 --> 09:50.386
given his recent history, but
it's not my brain he'll be manhandling.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.120
- No.
- Damn. She's HLA type B3.

09:54.193 --> 09:57.560
Have to hit her with the DTIC
and high dose IL-2 instead.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.794
- IL-2? That's pretty toxic.
- It's about as bad as it gets.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.394
- You're gonna tell Izzie this now?
- I am her oncologist.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.098
Studies show giving patients
bad news before surgery

10:07.139 --> 10:10.165
can drastically increase
their chances of complications.

10:10.209 --> 10:13.940
Today or tomorrow, the news is the same.
Right now, I have time.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.039
You coming?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.982
I believe Izzie is
down in radiology now.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.849
Fine. We can wait an hour.

10:27.226 --> 10:31.219
- Chief, you paged me?
- Karev. Yes, I did.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.924
Um...

10:32.965 --> 10:35.832
As you know, we're gonna
be harvesting eggs.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.130
From Stevens.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.606
Who, I believe, is someone
you're having relations with.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.973
- Chief.
- Frozen eggs have a better

10:44.010 --> 10:48.310
survival rate when
they're... fertilized.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.379
- Fertilized.
- I know this is a lot to digest.

10:52.418 --> 10:57.515
So take some time, think about it.

10:57.556 --> 11:00.423
If you decide this
is something you might consider...

11:00.493 --> 11:03.860
- Give me the cup.
- Karev. Speak to Stevens.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.488
Just give me the cup!

11:20.279 --> 11:24.215
- Is she doing OK?
- Yeah. Well, she says she is.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.844
- Do you believe her?
- No. Not really.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.655
Oh. Heads up.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.780
- What do you hear?
- Motorcycle lost control. No helmet,

11:59.852 --> 12:03.219
massive head trauma,
lost vital signs en route.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.780
- Good to have you back, Shepherd.
- Thanks.

12:35.387 --> 12:36.820
Get back inside. He's DOA.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.490
Hunt? Did you hear me?

12:44.263 --> 12:45.821
Owen.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.846
Swender has no vision.

13:07.887 --> 13:11.345
He wrapped his hands around your throat,
you're pretending nothing happened.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.618
Focus on Izzie.

13:12.658 --> 13:16.651
Hunt literally tried to kill you.
He's barely back from Iraq.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.858
It's obvious he has issues. That
doesn't mean you have to stand by...

13:19.899 --> 13:24.495
If he had a heart attack or a stroke
or lost a leg, would you walk away?

13:25.004 --> 13:27.996
How is it acceptable
I walk away from this? He's wounded.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.769
He has war wounds, Meredith.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.301
It's not cut and dried.
And it's not as bad as you think it is.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.873
Clear.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.816
- This might be it.
- From your lips to God's ears.

13:39.852 --> 13:42.946
Charge to 360. Clear.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.587
- Oh, for the love of God.
- Hey.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.118
You know how many people
are in this hospital waiting,

13:51.163 --> 13:54.223
hoping loved one might live?
You're a bunch of vultures.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.330
- But we're not.
- Aunt Joyce was given a month to live

13:58.370 --> 14:01.635
three years ago.
And we were crushed.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.166
And we held her hand
at her bedside for weeks,

14:05.244 --> 14:08.008
and we said our tearful goodbyes.
And then...

14:09.315 --> 14:11.340
...she stabilized.

14:11.383 --> 14:14.079
She's been in and out of the hospital
once a month.

14:14.153 --> 14:18.180
Each time we jump on a plane, sit by her
bed, say our goodbyes all over again.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.455
And each time,
she winds up getting better.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.155
We want to be here when she goes.
We really do.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.996
But... it's a lot
of flying around the country.

14:28.033 --> 14:33.027
She's ready. We're all ready.
It's time.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.006
And I've got a board meeting tomorrow.

14:37.743 --> 14:39.108
Big one.

14:41.981 --> 14:45.849
They're doing tests that show altered
brain anatomy in patients with PTSD.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.946
Close to understanding the
physical side of psychological trauma.

14:49.989 --> 14:54.790
- Amazing what you can see with an MRl.
- What did Meredith tell you?

14:54.827 --> 14:58.058
Post-traumatic stress
is a real injury, Owen.

14:58.130 --> 15:02.999
It can be healed. There are resources,
vet centers, therapy.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.802
You shouldn't try
and handle this on your own.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.033
I came back in one piece,
both arms, both legs.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.234
Lots of guys came back
with real injuries.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.609
The worst I have is nightmares
or freezing for a moment...

15:13.679 --> 15:18.116
Is that what happened last night?
You had a freezing moment?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.083
If you want, I can help.

15:21.987 --> 15:23.249
Oh, yeah?

15:23.289 --> 15:26.850
I'm not the one who needs help.
I'm not the one who cut out half a brain

15:26.926 --> 15:30.521
and ran off to hide. I'm not the one
half the hospital is talking about.

15:30.562 --> 15:35.363
You should spend less time worrying
about me and take a look in the mirror.

15:41.840 --> 15:46.436
Karev? Just checking in.
To see how you're com...

15:46.478 --> 15:49.038
- See how you're doing.
- I'd be doing better

15:49.081 --> 15:51.606
if you weren't on the other side
of the door listening.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.515
Uh... Right, right. Sorry.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.353
I said go away.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.288
You left the door unlocked. That's bold.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.795
- The chief send you in here?
- No. I offered to come in

16:05.831 --> 16:09.528
- in case you need to talk.
- You think talking will help?

16:09.568 --> 16:14.096
A Dixie cup full of my swimmers
will make everything OK? It's crap.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.902
This is crap!

16:17.810 --> 16:21.678
You can't go messing
with people's heads like that.

16:21.714 --> 16:25.548
Even if she freezes the embryos, you
think we'll get a chance to use them?

16:25.584 --> 16:28.576
You think she'll still be here?

16:28.620 --> 16:31.885
You think she'll survive all this?
You think...

16:34.226 --> 16:40.187
I think... She told me... She told me
she was seeing a ghost, OK?

16:40.733 --> 16:44.794
And I'm so used to all the crazy chicks
in my life that I didn't even...

16:48.674 --> 16:52.201
I'm a doctor. A doctor!

16:54.346 --> 16:56.246
And I didn't even think to...

16:58.751 --> 17:01.652
And now she's... This is...

17:01.687 --> 17:06.954
This is wrong. This isn't
how it's supposed to happen.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.550
- I know.
- It's crap!

17:09.595 --> 17:12.325
- I know.
- I hate this.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.127
I know.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.656
This isn't...

17:19.838 --> 17:24.332
This isn't how we were...
This isn't how I wanted to do this.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.834
This isn't how Izzie and I
were supposed to make a baby.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.757
I haven't seen you all day.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.568
What if I hadn't woken up?

17:54.840 --> 17:59.402
I can't even remember what happened.
I have no memory, no way to...

18:02.581 --> 18:06.142
I would never hurt you, ever.

18:06.218 --> 18:10.018
But I did. My hands just...

18:10.089 --> 18:13.115
How could my own two hands
be capable...?

18:15.160 --> 18:18.254
- I can't do this, Cristina.
- But you did wake up.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.857
- Stop blaming yourself.
- We have to stop seeing each other.

18:20.899 --> 18:21.923
Why?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.764
- Cristina, I almost...
- Almost what?

18:25.804 --> 18:29.240
I told you, I know my limits.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.640
Let me decide what I can handle.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.934
Good. Stand right there. Let me see.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.996
- I never know how long to make these.
- I like the color. Who's it for, Karev?

19:03.108 --> 19:06.737
- Haven't seen much of him today.
- He's working. They're all working.

19:06.778 --> 19:09.576
I told them to go work.
Their patients shouldn't suffer

19:09.615 --> 19:12.015
because I have things
growing on my organs.

19:14.319 --> 19:20.349
I have got a colectomy this afternoon.
If you were the resident assisting me,

19:20.392 --> 19:24.158
and I were to say to you, "Divide
the cecum," what would you use?

19:24.630 --> 19:28.589
I'm not assisting you. You're not
gonna ask me to divide the cecum.

19:28.634 --> 19:32.468
But you're not going to get rusty.
In a year, you need to do this stuff.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.369
You need to teach residents.

19:34.406 --> 19:37.603
- Think I'm gonna be here in a year?
- Yes, I do.

19:39.044 --> 19:43.378
So I have exposed
the right lower quadrant,

19:43.415 --> 19:45.849
and you are dividing the cecum with...

19:46.552 --> 19:48.383
Forceps.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.615
Lift free from the arachnoid.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.896
Tacking sutures.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.226
Patties.

20:05.337 --> 20:07.430
Suction.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.953
Starting over.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.297
Here's your cup, all filled up.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.830
- I'm eating here, Karev.
- It's fine, I washed my hands.

20:42.874 --> 20:47.072
Did you talk to Izzie about this yet?
Considering you two are basically

20:47.112 --> 20:50.548
conceiving a child together,
think you should talk with her?

20:50.582 --> 20:53.380
Look, you said she
needed my... contribution.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.545
Here's my contribution. Whatever.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.963
- Hi. How's Izzie?
- I don't know.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.933
- How's Izzie?
- Why?

21:16.975 --> 21:20.274
- Have you been to see her?
- No, I've been working all day.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.676
- What?
- Have you been to see Izzie?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.018
No. Haven't you?

21:41.533 --> 21:45.333
- You finished that thing in one day?
- Had some free time.

21:45.370 --> 21:49.739
- Had a lot of free time.
- Nobody came up to visit?

21:49.775 --> 21:55.645
It's OK. If I were them, I wouldn't
want to step foot in this room either.

21:55.714 --> 21:59.241
- You don't have to keep checking on me.
- I do have to.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.878
I have to start you on this
before your surgery.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.945
Right. Surgery.

22:05.524 --> 22:08.960
And I wanted to tell you
how my surgery went this afternoon.

22:09.027 --> 22:12.895
- Colon guy?
- The colectomy went great,

22:12.931 --> 22:16.890
but I was in there, and I see a mass.

22:16.935 --> 22:21.133
- You're kidding. Was it a big mass?
- Big enough. The size of a fist.

22:21.173 --> 22:25.439
This is going to burn a little at first,
but just for a few seconds.

22:25.477 --> 22:29.573
So we had to mobilize the SMA

22:29.614 --> 22:33.812
before we could resect the thing
and reconnect the bowel.

22:36.955 --> 22:39.150
I wished Izzie Stevens would die.

22:41.259 --> 22:44.285
I wished her dead. Every day,
for I don't know how long.

22:44.329 --> 22:47.924
I woke up every morning wishing
Izzie Stevens would die. And now...

22:51.770 --> 22:53.863
What kind of person
wishes someone would die?

22:53.905 --> 22:57.272
What kind of doctor wishes...?
Knowing how things happen, what...?

23:01.113 --> 23:04.207
What kind of...?
What kind of doctor wishes...?

23:04.616 --> 23:09.076
Are you in here, right now,
praying for Izzie to die?

23:09.855 --> 23:13.052
No. I'm praying for her to live.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.829
- Clear!
- You know what?

23:19.865 --> 23:21.958
- Wait outside!
- Will you let us know...?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.627
Yeah. I'll let you know.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.737
- Bastards.
- Push one of epi.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.173
Charge to 360. Clear!

23:31.276 --> 23:34.803
Come on, Joyce, you old bag,
don't give 'em the satisfaction.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.313
- Charge again.
- Charged.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.316
Clear!

23:45.457 --> 23:48.426
Hey. I'm Dr. Karev.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.486
You're a fighter, you know that?
You worked hard today.

23:51.530 --> 23:53.498
She needs some rest.

23:55.901 --> 23:59.894
Make sure the family doesn't come in.
Give her a break from all the love.

23:59.971 --> 24:03.498
No. They're impatient.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.776
It's been a long time.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.679
But they always come.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.552
They're my people.

24:16.555 --> 24:19.080
People keep you going.

24:20.992 --> 24:24.553
People are better than no people.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.366
Uh... It's not a good time,
he's still scrubbing in.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.345
I know, it's just...
he should wear this.

24:41.379 --> 24:44.109
It's his ferryboat scrub cap.
He loves ferryboats.

24:51.623 --> 24:54.285
- Meredith.
- What are you doing?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.453
You're gonna have to re-scrub.

24:58.263 --> 25:00.595
- I'm not ready.
- Yes, you are.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.123
I need to know
that at least I have you.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.966
No matter what happens in there,
I need you to say yes.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.528
- I need to know...
- I can't say yes.

25:07.572 --> 25:11.133
Not if agreeing to be with you forever
will make it OK if Izzie dies.

25:11.176 --> 25:15.772
I can't say yes.
I love you, and you can do this.

25:15.814 --> 25:18.749
You can do this.
I know you can.

25:33.899 --> 25:34.991
Iz!

26:02.961 --> 26:05.486
See you soon, Dr. Stevens.

26:06.364 --> 26:09.026
- Hope so.
- Know so.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.330
- Dr. Bailey, if something goes wrong...
- It won't.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.242
The scarf.

26:19.978 --> 26:21.377
I made it for you.

26:29.621 --> 26:32.055
Beautiful night to save lives.

26:35.894 --> 26:37.657
Let's get started.

26:53.845 --> 26:57.872
I get why I haven't been camped out
at Izzie's bedside holding her hand...

26:57.949 --> 27:00.247
- I'm not talking about this.
- Why not?

27:00.285 --> 27:05.552
Maybe it's the fact that I asked Izzie
a hundred times what was wrong,

27:05.624 --> 27:08.286
and she just ignored me.

27:08.326 --> 27:11.022
Then there's the fact that
when she actually needed help,

27:11.062 --> 27:14.657
she trusted Cristina, of all people!

27:15.033 --> 27:18.400
And there's the fact that she's your
best friend, and she might die on you.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.373
There's also that.

27:30.582 --> 27:33.642
Come on.
We are going to go wait for Izzie.

27:33.685 --> 27:36.518
George, you were my husband
and you slept with her.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.387
You are the reason I wished her dead.
You owe me this.

27:41.559 --> 27:46.997
You can lie to yourself all you want,
but I know you. I loved you once.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.926
And I know you care
if she lives or dies.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.268
Surgery started.

28:02.580 --> 28:05.071
- Hey, have they started surgery yet?
- Yeah.

28:06.918 --> 28:10.684
Dr. Grey? We were wondering,
did Dr. Stevens' surgery start or...?

28:10.722 --> 28:13.156
Keep it moving. No loitering.
That's the rule.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.954
If they wanna stay, let 'em stay.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.127
People are better than no people.

28:23.735 --> 28:24.793
Clamp.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.699
I am ready to... No.

28:31.276 --> 28:35.269
Yes. OK. I'm ready to buzz
the superficial temporal artery.

28:35.313 --> 28:38.544
- Tenting sutures.
- There's no rush. Take your time.

28:38.583 --> 28:41.074
- Everyone is on your side.
- You sure that's gonna hold,

28:41.119 --> 28:43.952
- with all the friable scar tissue?
- Dr. Swender?

28:44.989 --> 28:49.392
Actually, I saw Dr. Shepherd do
three different craniotomies last month,

28:49.461 --> 28:53.261
each with easily double
the amount of friable tissue.

28:53.331 --> 28:55.231
They held just fine.

28:56.701 --> 28:59.192
Next tenting suture, please.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.563
Clear!

29:04.209 --> 29:08.145
Push another epi. Charge again.
Come on, Mrs. Wallington. Clear!

29:13.084 --> 29:17.817
I'm so sorry. She's not responding.
We've done everything, so she's gone.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.888
Thank you.
You did a wonderful job.

29:28.199 --> 29:31.259
- Are you kidding me?!
- Oh, God, this is never gonna end!

29:31.336 --> 29:35.796
No... No, she's gone.
She's really gone.

29:35.874 --> 29:38.274
It's really gone. It's her pacemaker.

29:38.309 --> 29:41.608
It's still firing. Makes it seem like
there's a heartbeat. She's gone.

29:41.646 --> 29:44.410
Just with a heartbeat.

29:45.483 --> 29:48.611
- Are you sure she's dead, young lady?
- I'm an intern.

29:48.653 --> 29:52.214
I'm not authorized to call time of death
in a situation like this.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.656
So I'm gonna get my superior.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.928
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

30:04.602 --> 30:07.537
- I'm worried about you.
- Meredith...

30:07.572 --> 30:10.006
- Choking.
- Stop.

30:10.074 --> 30:12.838
- It's unacceptable.
- Back off.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.803
- Hands around the neck.
- Ring thrown in your face.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.646
This'll shut the pacemaker down.

30:27.859 --> 30:32.523
Time of death, 2240.

30:33.565 --> 30:37.092
There you go. She's officially
dead. You can catch your plane.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.535
Get to your board meeting.
You can leave.

30:59.224 --> 31:04.093
Actually, could we stay
a little while longer?

31:37.295 --> 31:39.286
What are you all
doing out here?

31:42.300 --> 31:45.701
Waiting for Izzie, sir. We're waiting.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.833
You're scared.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.444
I'm scared too.

32:10.094 --> 32:15.498
Damn it. Some of the Sylvian vessels
are wrapped around the tumor capsule.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.694
- Penfield four, please.
- Really?

32:17.769 --> 32:21.796
- Instead of the arachnoid knife?
- Yes, instead of the arachnoid knife.

32:21.839 --> 32:26.037
Because the Penfield four will let me
slide the arteries around the met.

32:26.110 --> 32:29.136
I need to dissect it free
so I can de-bulk the tumor,

32:29.180 --> 32:33.378
avoiding unnecessary trauma to my
patient. So, yes, Penfield four, please.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.288
- Vitals stable the entire time?
- Spikes or intracranial pressure?

32:44.362 --> 32:47.923
- Was there residual tumor?
- Shepherd resected all of the tumor.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.959
She'll be in the PACU for an hour.
She's fine.

32:55.573 --> 33:00.272
Your friend is just fine.
No thanks to any of you.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.204
Tomorrow, do better.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.886
- The surgery went well today.
- Mmm.

33:14.926 --> 33:18.623
Shouldn't you and Meredith
be out celebrating or something?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.062
She turned me down twice.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.891
She said she understands, she forgives
me for what happened in the woods.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.731
So you showed her your dark side.

33:29.774 --> 33:32.709
Meredith never struck me as a woman
who's afraid of the dark.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.541
I don't know.

33:36.647 --> 33:39.810
Do you know it was
Meredith's idea to ask Izzie

33:39.851 --> 33:42.183
if she wanted to harvest her eggs?

33:43.187 --> 33:47.248
So Izzie could have a chance at the
future she wanted. The future, Derek.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.426
She was confident you'd succeed today.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.364
Meredith believes in you.

34:13.016 --> 34:14.382
I'm here, Iz.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.554
I'm right here.

34:32.837 --> 34:36.034
- Izzie's surgery went well.
- Good. That's good.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.973
I wish things were...

34:41.813 --> 34:44.110
That they could be...

34:44.148 --> 34:47.413
- That we could be...
- Me too.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.057
Could I hold you?

36:58.683 --> 37:01.709
- Wait! No. You can't take that one.
- Why not?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.315
I said don't take it.

37:04.055 --> 37:07.491
I will take the elevator I want to take.

37:30.615 --> 37:31.707
Well, go on.

37:40.291 --> 37:43.351
Hey. Come on in.

37:48.165 --> 37:51.328
This is a CT for Katie Bryce.

37:51.369 --> 37:54.338
16-year-old female,
subarachnoid aneurysm.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.567
From a fall during gymnastics.
I remember.

37:56.607 --> 38:00.338
It was the first surgery we ever
scrubbed in together on. Our first save.

38:01.412 --> 38:05.212
Right here is a cerebral cyst.
Tough save, but we did it.

38:05.249 --> 38:08.480
I kissed you in the stairwell
after this surgery.

38:08.519 --> 38:11.113
This is where Dr. Bailey
kicked you out of the surgery

38:11.155 --> 38:14.147
because she caught us
in your driveway in my car.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.493
And right here,
this was a seven-hour craniotomy.

38:18.529 --> 38:21.225
You held a clamp the entire time
and never flinched.

38:21.265 --> 38:24.393
That's when I knew
you were gonna be an incredible surgeon.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.706
Beth Monroe, who made our clinical trial
a success by surviving.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.470
You talked me into putting her under.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.975
That's when I knew I needed you.

38:38.316 --> 38:42.252
And this is today.
Post-op head CT of Izzie Stevens.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.987
See that?

38:47.024 --> 38:50.084
Right there. Tumor-free.

38:51.329 --> 38:55.322
Because of you.
You got me into the OR.

38:55.933 --> 38:59.767
If there is a crisis, you don't freeze.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.567
You move forward.

39:01.605 --> 39:06.008
You get the rest of us to move forward
because you've seen worse,

39:06.043 --> 39:10.673
you've survived worse.
And you know we'll survive too.

39:12.983 --> 39:15.975
You say you're all dark and twisty.

39:16.721 --> 39:18.313
That's not a flaw.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.885
It's a strength.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.859
It makes you who you are.

39:26.464 --> 39:29.194
I am not gonna get down on one knee.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.532
I am not gonna ask a question.

39:34.238 --> 39:36.536
I love you, Meredith Grey.

39:38.242 --> 39:41.837
And I want to spend the rest
of my life... with you.

39:45.583 --> 39:48.950
And I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

40:11.942 --> 40:14.001
I don't think...

40:16.747 --> 40:19.409
I can't handle this after all.

40:22.453 --> 40:25.115
What...? What do you mean?

40:25.189 --> 40:28.647
- Are you saying...?
- I'm sorry.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.059
I am so, so sorry.

40:33.564 --> 40:36.260
But I'm lying here in your arms...

40:38.569 --> 40:41.436
...and I'm afraid to fall asleep.

40:43.874 --> 40:46.434
<i>Doesn't matter how tough we are.</i>

40:50.881 --> 40:53.509
I want to apologize for earlier.

40:53.551 --> 40:59.148
- What I said was... It was out of line.
- It's already forgotten.

40:59.757 --> 41:02.225
Thank you for doing this.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.331
<i>Trauma always leaves a scar.</i>

41:24.548 --> 41:25.981
I'm engaged.

41:27.618 --> 41:29.882
I broke up with Owen.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.991
<i>It follows us home.</i>

41:45.469 --> 41:46.936
<i>It changes our lives.</i>

41:46.971 --> 41:48.336
Hey.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.009
I snooched into a cup for you today.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.541
Thank you?

41:57.615 --> 42:02.245
<i>Trauma messes everybody up,</i>
<i>but maybe that's the point.</i>

42:02.319 --> 42:05.982
<i>All the pain and the fear</i>
<i>and the crap...</i>

42:06.023 --> 42:09.686
<i>Maybe going through all of that</i>
<i>is what keeps us moving forward.</i>

42:09.727 --> 42:11.991
<i>It's what pushes us.</i>

42:12.029 --> 42:14.964
<i>Maybe we have to get</i>
<i>a little messed up</i>

42:15.032 --> 42:16.932
<i>before we can step up.</i>
