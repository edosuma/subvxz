WEBVTT

00:01.389 --> 00:03.448
- Amanda Tanner is pregnant.
- What?

00:03.658 --> 00:04.647
<i>Previously on Scandal...</i>

00:04.759 --> 00:07.387
And I wanna tell the world what he did.

00:07.528 --> 00:11.328
- Amanda...
- I want them all to burn for this.

00:11.432 --> 00:12.729
You don't have to worry
about that sex tape,

00:12.833 --> 00:13.959
because who needs a sex tape

00:14.068 --> 00:16.161
when you've got a fetus full
of Presidential DNA?

00:16.270 --> 00:17.396
It's not my baby.

00:17.505 --> 00:19.336
I'm out. I gonna tell them the truth.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.771
She's not our problem, she's a kid.

00:20.908 --> 00:22.432
Our real problem is Olivia Pope.

00:22.677 --> 00:25.271
President Fitzgerald Thomas Grant,
the Third,

00:25.479 --> 00:27.037
has declared war on you, Olivia.

00:27.214 --> 00:29.512
May God have mercy on your soul.

00:32.386 --> 00:34.149
Answers, people. We need answers.

00:34.255 --> 00:35.449
And time is of the essence.

00:35.556 --> 00:37.217
Her phone's gone. And her purse.
She ran away.

00:37.325 --> 00:38.485
You told her
she was gonna have to go on TV,

00:38.593 --> 00:39.753
she freaked out, and she ran away.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.725
I gotta say, as crime scenes go,
it's pretty clean.

00:41.829 --> 00:43.319
No broken locks, no signs of struggle,

00:43.431 --> 00:45.490
and I'm not finding any prints
aside from yours and Amanda's.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.068
Because it's not a crime scene.
Because she ran away.

00:48.202 --> 00:49.430
- There's someone watching you.
- What?

00:49.570 --> 00:51.367
Your trash is gone
and it's not trash day.

00:51.472 --> 00:53.201
And there's a sedan
parked across the street.

00:53.307 --> 00:56.003
U.S. Government plates.
Tinted windows.

00:57.812 --> 00:58.779
What about Amanda, Huck?

00:58.879 --> 01:00.744
Whoever it was
came up through the service elevator.

01:00.848 --> 01:02.543
Picked the lock on the back door,
sedated her,

01:02.650 --> 01:03.844
taped her up, got her in a duffel bag.

01:04.751 --> 01:07.414
In and out, probably seven minutes.
Six, if they were quick.

01:08.289 --> 01:09.551
How do you know?

01:09.657 --> 01:10.749
That's how I would do it.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.133 --> 01:21.863
My secretary has a standing order
to stop you from walking in here.

01:21.969 --> 01:23.402
Alissa, you're fired.

01:23.504 --> 01:24.801
One of my clients is missing.

01:24.905 --> 01:27.032
Have you looked in jail?
You often seem to find them there.

01:27.141 --> 01:28.199
Her name is Amanda Tanner.

01:28.309 --> 01:30.800
She's 27
and she was staying in my apartment.

01:30.945 --> 01:32.572
- How long has she been gone?
- Five, six hours.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.738
You consider that missing?

01:33.848 --> 01:34.906
That's barely enough time

01:35.016 --> 01:38.076
To rack up a good bar tab.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.618
- Oh, God.
- What's wrong?

01:40.688 --> 01:42.952
I know I ask a lot of you,
but this Amanda thing is big.

01:43.057 --> 01:45.150
She's a good kid
and she was under my protection.

01:45.259 --> 01:46.385
Can you help me find her?

01:47.194 --> 01:49.389
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, David.

01:50.798 --> 01:52.925
Don't fire Alissa. I snuck in
while she was in the bathroom.

01:58.272 --> 01:59.796
You're late.
I keep trying Amanda's phone

01:59.907 --> 02:02.034
- but it goes straight to voice mail.
- I say, "All hands on deck"...

02:02.143 --> 02:03.132
Harrison, she's our client,
she's missing.

02:03.244 --> 02:04.438
...I mean all hands on deck.

02:04.545 --> 02:06.376
We should be doing things,
things should be happening.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.107
Shouldn't we at least file
a missing persons report?

02:08.215 --> 02:09.512
Just 'cause you don't see
things happening

02:09.616 --> 02:10.584
doesn't mean things aren't happening.

02:10.685 --> 02:12.209
With Olivia,
things are always happening.

02:12.319 --> 02:14.344
I just don't...
What could possibly be more important

02:14.455 --> 02:16.184
than Amanda right now?

02:16.290 --> 02:17.416
That.

02:35.337 --> 02:37.940
<i>sync and corrections by majtjkong</i>

02:40.581 --> 02:43.550
I first met Paul ten years ago,
at the Governor's Conference.

02:44.385 --> 02:46.285
I thought my speech was pretty killer,

02:46.387 --> 02:48.082
so when Paul took me aside afterward,

02:48.189 --> 02:50.419
I was looking forward to simply,
"Congratulations, Fitz,

02:50.524 --> 02:52.549
"you moved me to tears. "

02:52.660 --> 02:56.152
And then for ten very long minutes
he told me point by point

02:56.263 --> 02:59.494
why every word out of my mouth
was not only wrong,

02:59.600 --> 03:01.966
but potentially the dumbest thing
any politician had ever said.

03:03.170 --> 03:06.071
Senator Sanchez told you the hard truth
because he cared,

03:06.540 --> 03:08.167
because he thought
we could all do better.

03:08.442 --> 03:11.036
He scored no political points.
He never asked for anything in return,

03:11.145 --> 03:13.875
but he earned my profound gratitude.

03:13.981 --> 03:15.642
And today, my profound sadness.

03:17.451 --> 03:21.444
Of course, the Senator would be
the first to object if I stood up here today

03:21.555 --> 03:24.683
and talked about him,
and failed to mention

03:24.792 --> 03:26.521
the 119 other people
who died this morning.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.662
This is a tragic day for all of us.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.930
Our prayers are with all those
who lost loved ones on Flight 684.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.130
Where's my daughter?

03:42.743 --> 03:43.903
I can't...

03:45.546 --> 03:48.709
Miss Pope. Nelson O'Shea,
Pilots' Union. Nice to finally meet you.

03:48.816 --> 03:50.943
Yes. I wish
it were under better circumstances.

03:51.051 --> 03:52.143
Yes, very sad.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.644
So, it's a standard crash investigation.

03:54.755 --> 03:56.746
We'll need you to make a statement
on behalf the Pilots' Union

03:56.857 --> 03:57.824
to the press as soon as possible.

03:57.925 --> 03:59.552
Airline PR is up there right now,
so as soon as they're...

03:59.660 --> 04:00.820
You let them go first?

04:00.928 --> 04:02.793
I didn't think it was a problem.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.760
Sky National has immediately activated

04:08.869 --> 04:10.564
our emergency response protocol

04:10.671 --> 04:13.970
and is in direct contact with the FAA
and NTSB.

04:14.074 --> 04:15.735
Although our primary concern
at this time

04:15.843 --> 04:18.243
is for the passengers on board
the aircraft and their families,

04:18.411 --> 04:19.538
we're able to assure you

04:19.647 --> 04:22.673
this particular plane
has a perfect safety record.

04:22.783 --> 04:24.375
And there it is.

04:24.885 --> 04:26.079
They are saying it's the pilot's fault.

04:26.187 --> 04:27.154
No, he didn't, he just said...

04:27.254 --> 04:28.744
They're not saying it,
but they're saying it.

04:28.856 --> 04:31.256
And this crowd's eating it up
with a spoon.

04:32.159 --> 04:33.285
Make sure
we know when the memorial is,

04:33.394 --> 04:34.383
so we can clear my schedule.

04:34.495 --> 04:37.623
Sir, we ought to take this chance
to bring the DREAM Act to a vote.

04:37.765 --> 04:41.462
Cyrus, the poor man is still scattered
across the Virginia countryside

04:41.569 --> 04:43.036
and you wanna start using him
to leverage a vote?

04:43.137 --> 04:44.365
Paul wanted this more than anything.

04:44.471 --> 04:47.338
A pathway to citizenship
for immigrant kids who go to college.

04:47.441 --> 04:48.738
- He'd be honored.
- It's a divisive issue,

04:48.843 --> 04:50.037
even within our own party.

04:50.144 --> 04:51.270
Let me put a call in to his wife.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.640
See if she'll reach out
to the fence sitters.

04:52.746 --> 04:54.907
- How close is the vote?
- Nose count has us within four or five.

04:55.015 --> 04:57.245
Nah. We're gonna look opportunistic.

04:59.486 --> 05:02.148
Never let a crisis go to waste,
Mr. President.

05:04.091 --> 05:05.422
Make the call.

05:08.696 --> 05:10.755
And how long was her tour of duty
in the Air National Guard?

05:11.532 --> 05:13.432
And she flew C-141 s out of Dover?

05:13.767 --> 05:15.758
Okay, thank you so much.

05:17.638 --> 05:18.866
How many times do I have to tell you,

05:18.973 --> 05:21.134
you can't just walk in here
whenever you feel like it?

05:21.242 --> 05:24.006
Look. Amanda Tanner is gone
and that means my story is gone,

05:24.111 --> 05:25.703
but it also means your client is gone,

05:25.813 --> 05:28.611
so I thought I could just walk in here
and talk to you.

05:28.716 --> 05:31.617
If Amanda is gone,
and I'm not saying she is,

05:31.719 --> 05:32.913
then I'm sure Olivia's working on it.

05:33.020 --> 05:35.614
Well, I saw the news. Doesn't she have
her hands full with this plane crash?

05:35.723 --> 05:37.486
Sometimes just because
you can't see things

05:37.591 --> 05:39.388
happening doesn't mean
they're not happening. Or something.

05:39.793 --> 05:42.125
You know, if she is gone.

05:42.229 --> 05:43.526
There's a missing persons report,
Quinn.

05:43.998 --> 05:45.966
There's a report?
Who filed it?

05:46.333 --> 05:47.493
Amanda's father.

06:13.294 --> 06:14.818
So what are you calling yourself now?

06:15.262 --> 06:16.422
Huck. You?

06:16.697 --> 06:19.723
Charlie. Huck Finn? That's funny.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.092
Well, Charlie, like Charlie Brown?

06:23.103 --> 06:25.333
- I thought you were dead.
- I'm not dead.

06:27.141 --> 06:28.267
Huck freaking Finn?

06:28.742 --> 06:30.471
Don't make fun of my name.

06:31.412 --> 06:33.380
- You out of business?
- I was never in business.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.947
It's lucrative when you contract out.

06:35.082 --> 06:36.572
I'm a retired government employee.

06:36.717 --> 06:38.344
Oh, really? You sure?

06:38.452 --> 06:41.012
You know what they say:
Once you go black, you never go back.

06:42.056 --> 06:43.785
Ops, that is. Black ops.

06:44.058 --> 06:46.526
You never could tell a decent joke.

06:47.795 --> 06:48.819
So what do you want, man?

06:48.929 --> 06:53.559
Female, 5'4", 105 pounds,
27 years old, Amanda Lynn Tanner?

06:54.902 --> 06:56.062
Don't know what you're talking about.

06:56.170 --> 06:58.035
You're getting sloppy in your old age.

06:58.138 --> 07:00.436
You crossed the street at a light.
I got you on the traffic cam.

07:00.874 --> 07:03.365
Well, then. You don't need
to ask me about her now, do you?

07:03.477 --> 07:04.501
You got me on the traffic cam.

07:05.245 --> 07:06.906
Yeah. But where is she?

07:07.348 --> 07:11.341
No, no. That's tacky. It's tasteless.
You know better than to ask.

07:11.986 --> 07:12.975
What did you think?

07:13.120 --> 07:14.610
That you were gonna buy me
an assassin's brunch

07:14.722 --> 07:16.019
and then we'd hold hands?

07:16.123 --> 07:19.456
No. Geez.
Now you're off looking for missing girls?

07:19.560 --> 07:22.859
Come on. Tacky. Stop looking.
She's gone.

07:23.430 --> 07:25.091
Hey, you ever wanna come back,

07:25.466 --> 07:27.627
make a little more money
than the U.S. Government pays,

07:27.735 --> 07:31.637
you give me a call. Talent like yours
should not go to waste.

07:35.209 --> 07:38.372
And it's not like Charlie Brown.
Like Manson.

07:38.746 --> 07:40.976
Charlie Manson. Now that's a name.

07:41.148 --> 07:44.140
Huck Finn?

07:44.284 --> 07:45.512
Come on.

07:48.088 --> 07:49.487
Hey, buddy.

07:54.995 --> 07:56.326
Welcome, everyone.

07:56.430 --> 07:59.524
This is the preliminary CVR meeting
of all interested parties

07:59.633 --> 08:01.794
to Sky National Flight 684.

08:01.902 --> 08:03.927
This morning
I'll play the black box recording

08:04.038 --> 08:05.699
in its entirety without stopping.

08:05.839 --> 08:07.807
You'll hear it once and once only.

08:07.975 --> 08:10.136
The National Transportation
Safety Board prohibits you

08:10.244 --> 08:12.041
from recording
what you're about to hear.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.204
You are allowed to take notes

08:13.313 --> 08:15.713
but you're prohibited from taking
those notes from this room.

08:15.849 --> 08:16.941
Any questions?

08:20.421 --> 08:22.218
<i>Here it is, my special fruit drink,</i>

08:22.589 --> 08:23.749
<i>That's good, What's in it?</i>

08:23.857 --> 08:25.324
<i>Cranberry, grapefruit,</i>

08:25.426 --> 08:26.552
<i>It'd be perfect with some vodka,</i>

08:27.528 --> 08:28.586
<i>Sky National 684,</i>

08:28.695 --> 08:31.095
<i>you're cleared to descend to
and maintain 5,000,</i>

08:32.265 --> 08:34.826
<i>Roger National 684,
we'll be out of 15 for five,</i>

08:35.169 --> 08:37.364
<i>National
684, we got a Sky Coast Aerostream</i>

08:37.471 --> 08:38.836
<i>four miles away at two o'clock,</i>

08:38.938 --> 08:41.203
<i>Possible wake turbulence,
You may feel a bump or two,</i>

08:41.442 --> 08:42.875
<i>684's got the Aerostream,</i>

08:44.078 --> 08:45.443
<i>And I feel the bump or two,</i>

08:46.380 --> 08:49.178
<i>Hang on, I'm pitching down,
We're nose down,</i>

08:49.283 --> 08:50.545
<i>Sky National 684, I show descending,</i>

08:50.651 --> 08:51.811
<i>What's your status?</i>

08:52.886 --> 08:55.184
<i>Kick rudder,
Lori, left rudder, Left rudder!</i>

08:55.289 --> 08:57.348
<i>Sky National 684, what's your status?</i>

08:57.925 --> 08:59.290
<i>684, Emergency!</i>

09:00.494 --> 09:01.984
<i>Left rudder! Left rudder!</i>

09:02.229 --> 09:03.491
<i>What the hell are you...</i>

09:03.831 --> 09:04.798
<i>Here we go!</i>

09:10.737 --> 09:13.001
No, there was a loud bang
and the Captain was saying, "Hang on. "

09:13.107 --> 09:14.267
No, that was the First Officer.

09:14.374 --> 09:16.774
Fine, but I can't remember if he said it
before or after the two thumps.

09:16.877 --> 09:19.072
Before. I think. Or maybe after,

09:19.279 --> 09:21.110
I don't know. I should have written
the whole thing on my arm.

09:21.215 --> 09:23.206
It was before. The two thumps.

09:23.350 --> 09:25.181
It was loud thump, loud thump,
long clicking sound,

09:25.285 --> 09:26.843
short clicking sound,
then three faint thumps.

09:26.954 --> 09:28.251
The First Officer saying,
"Left rudder, left rudder!

09:28.388 --> 09:30.219
"What the hell are you...
Here we go. "

09:32.459 --> 09:34.222
I got a good ear.
But I'll tell you what I didn't hear

09:34.328 --> 09:36.660
in the last ten seconds. The pilot.

09:36.864 --> 09:38.491
Soon as they hit the wake
from the Aerostream,

09:38.599 --> 09:40.066
I think she panicked.
Maybe overcorrected.

09:40.167 --> 09:41.657
It was like she didn't hear or she froze.

09:41.768 --> 09:43.326
Which is exactly
what the airline will say.

09:43.470 --> 09:46.200
If Sky National can prove pilot error
they save millions of dollars.

09:46.306 --> 09:48.206
They don't have to ground their fleet,
do extra maintenance.

09:48.308 --> 09:51.436
They have every reason to wanna trash
Lori Mackelson in the press.

09:51.545 --> 09:53.410
Cast her as a panicking,
PMS-ing woman

09:53.514 --> 09:54.981
who can't handle a little turbulence.

09:55.082 --> 09:58.142
Lori had 16,000 flight hours
under her belt. She didn't panic.

09:58.252 --> 10:00.311
She was a great pilot,
under any conditions.

10:00.420 --> 10:01.387
She did not freeze.

10:01.522 --> 10:02.989
Can I help you, sir?

10:03.123 --> 10:04.852
Not unless you can bring my wife back.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.492
All I want them to do is to get up there
and say she didn't do this.

10:08.629 --> 10:09.926
Believe me, Andrew,
we're gonna do everything

10:10.030 --> 10:11.190
we can to clear your wife's name.

10:11.298 --> 10:12.424
Why haven't you said anything?

10:12.599 --> 10:14.897
The news's already said
the plane was perfect!

10:15.002 --> 10:16.731
Can't you just call a press conference?

10:16.837 --> 10:19.533
If I get up there and play defense,
hold my gloves in front of my face?

10:19.673 --> 10:21.197
It confirms their narrative.

10:21.375 --> 10:22.808
We need to change their narrative.

10:22.910 --> 10:24.707
We need to anticipate
what they're going to say about Lori

10:24.811 --> 10:27.905
before they say it and then hit back.
With evidence.

10:28.015 --> 10:30.950
So lay it on me.
What is the worst thing they can say?

10:33.854 --> 10:36.846
She's been sober for over 20 years.

10:37.891 --> 10:39.791
She still goes to AA meetings
from time to time.

10:39.893 --> 10:41.918
- So she's an alcoholic.
- That's not how I would phrase it.

10:42.029 --> 10:44.020
Which is why they will.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.794
<i>Sources say that the flight crew,</i>

10:50.904 --> 10:54.101
<i>including the Captain and First Officer,
were drinking at the hotel...</i>

10:54.208 --> 10:55.266
<i>...regulations prohibit</i>

10:55.375 --> 10:57.502
<i>the consumption of alcohol
12 hours before...</i>

10:57.611 --> 10:59.977
<i>...crew was in direct
violation of these regulations,</i>

11:00.080 --> 11:01.047
Boy, were they hammered.

11:01.148 --> 11:02.445
Not the pilots though, right?

11:02.549 --> 11:04.642
Two pilots. Six flight attendants.
Hammered.

11:04.751 --> 11:05.718
Even...

11:05.819 --> 11:07.582
I said,
"Y'all better not be flyin' tomorrow. "

11:07.688 --> 11:10.657
She says to me, "Don't worry.
These planes these days,

11:10.757 --> 11:13.055
"they fly themselves. "
Can you believe it?

11:13.160 --> 11:14.127
<i>According to the manufacturer</i>

11:14.228 --> 11:16.458
<i>the MW-85 has a perfect safety...</i>

11:16.563 --> 11:17.894
<i>One of the top
performing passenger planes</i>

11:17.998 --> 11:18.965
<i>in the world,</i>

11:19.066 --> 11:20.693
<i>Plane has met with
nothing but praise from the aviation...</i>

11:20.801 --> 11:22.564
<i>I could lose my job,
I just need a quick peek</i>

11:22.669 --> 11:23.931
at the mechanic reports.

11:24.037 --> 11:26.301
You're asking for a lot.
You're not offering much there, Stevie.

11:26.406 --> 11:27.373
No one will ever know.

11:27.641 --> 11:29.836
Our little secret, huh?

11:29.943 --> 11:32.104
Maybe if you wanna come by
my apartment?

11:32.212 --> 11:33.611
Around 8:00?

11:33.714 --> 11:36.308
I'd like to get in a workout
and have time to rinse off.

11:39.219 --> 11:41.153
<i>Early indications
from the black box recording</i>

11:41.255 --> 11:43.621
<i>indicate that the airport tower
tried to communicate...</i>

11:43.724 --> 11:46.557
Damn it! They already leaked
what was on the black box?

11:46.660 --> 11:48.753
Somewhere in that recording
is the truth. We need our own copy.

11:48.862 --> 11:50.261
I'll get Huck on it.

11:50.364 --> 11:51.388
<i>...every action
they're taking to the tower,</i>

11:51.498 --> 11:55.229
<i>Pleas from the First Officer
also appear to have been ignored,</i>

11:58.305 --> 12:00.102
I was this close
to getting the mechanic's report.

12:00.407 --> 12:01.431
What happened?

12:01.575 --> 12:02.667
I lost my superpowers.

12:03.543 --> 12:05.773
I'm engaged. I can't use every tool
in the box anymore.

12:05.879 --> 12:06.937
And by tool, you would mean your...

12:07.047 --> 12:11.279
Okay. Just find another tack, Stephen.
We need those reports. Abby?

12:11.418 --> 12:12.783
Bartender confirms that both pilots

12:12.886 --> 12:14.410
and all six flight attendants
were drinking.

12:14.554 --> 12:16.545
Six? Manifest listed five.

12:16.657 --> 12:17.624
Think one of them
didn't make the flight?

12:17.724 --> 12:18.713
Black box recording.

12:18.825 --> 12:19.849
How'd you get it?

12:19.960 --> 12:22.394
NTSB server. Kid's play.
Olivia, may I talk to you?

12:22.496 --> 12:23.588
Check the airline schedule,

12:23.697 --> 12:25.528
see what attendants
were supposed to fly 684.

12:25.632 --> 12:26.621
Got it.
- In your office?

12:26.733 --> 12:28.860
See what other flight crews
were passing through Philly that night.

12:28.969 --> 12:29.936
- Got it.
- Where's Quinn?

12:30.037 --> 12:31.095
- Has anybody seen Quinn?
- I think she went out.

12:31.204 --> 12:32.171
- Where's the manifest?
- On my desk.

12:32.272 --> 12:33.432
- She's dead.
- There is a missing flight attendant

12:33.540 --> 12:36.236
who is alive right now, we need
to find her before the airline does.

12:36.343 --> 12:38.208
Amanda Tanner is dead.

12:44.685 --> 12:45.709
Are you sure?

12:57.497 --> 12:58.555
Roll down the window.

13:00.901 --> 13:03.529
You tell your boy, you talk
into that little radio in your sleeve

13:03.637 --> 13:05.400
and you tell the President I know.

13:05.505 --> 13:06.733
I know what he did to her.

13:07.441 --> 13:08.908
I know.

13:15.749 --> 13:19.048
Shanker and Holiday are both on board.
But we're still three votes short.

13:19.152 --> 13:20.676
You'd make it a lot easier on the VP

13:20.787 --> 13:22.618
if you could throw in a few carrots
for border security.

13:22.789 --> 13:24.347
It might give us something to work with.

13:24.491 --> 13:25.719
Come on now, Billy.

13:25.826 --> 13:28.090
Are you telling me you can't work
with bright, energetic young people

13:28.195 --> 13:30.629
earning their way to citizenship
through good grades and hard work?

13:30.731 --> 13:31.857
It's not that, Mr. President...

13:31.965 --> 13:34.433
Great! Then I will count
on the Vice President's active support.

13:36.203 --> 13:37.295
Yeah?

13:43.210 --> 13:44.575
Quinn.

13:45.011 --> 13:47.673
- Who is this?
- Hank Tanner. I'm Amanda's father.

13:47.781 --> 13:48.907
It's a pleasure to meet you.

13:49.015 --> 13:51.449
I stopped by Amanda's place
and found Mr. Tanner outside.

13:51.718 --> 13:54.653
Amanda said that she came to work
for you after she left the White House.

13:54.755 --> 13:55.847
Yes. That's right.

13:55.956 --> 13:59.255
I don't mean to be a bother here,
but I've been talking to Mandy

13:59.359 --> 14:00.724
every day since she was in the hospital.

14:00.827 --> 14:02.590
And then I haven't heard anything
from her,

14:02.696 --> 14:05.494
so I decided to come up here and
make sure that everything was all right.

14:05.732 --> 14:07.597
Her mother is really worried about her.

14:07.734 --> 14:10.862
It's okay, Mr. Tanner.
Everything's going to be fine. I promise.

14:14.541 --> 14:17.237
Mr. Tanner,
you look like you could use a cup of tea.

14:17.344 --> 14:19.812
Quinn, would you help me get some tea
for Mr. Tanner?

14:19.913 --> 14:21.210
Thank you.

14:27.287 --> 14:28.754
What you did back there,
you made a promise.

14:28.855 --> 14:30.015
We don't make promises.

14:30.223 --> 14:31.815
- But...
- Amanda Tanner is dead.

14:32.926 --> 14:34.416
- What?
- She's dead.

14:34.861 --> 14:36.556
- How do you know?
- We know.

14:36.730 --> 14:37.822
But we can't tell him we know

14:37.931 --> 14:40.525
because we're not supposed to know
when there is no body.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.760
So right now
we're gonna go back in there

14:42.869 --> 14:45.099
and give that nice man a cup of tea

14:45.205 --> 14:46.900
and tell him we are doing everything
in our power

14:47.007 --> 14:50.170
to find his daughter.
And don't ever promise an outcome

14:50.277 --> 14:51.744
we can't deliver.

14:53.513 --> 14:55.208
I have to take this.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.253
Are we on a secure line?

15:06.359 --> 15:07.849
Why the hell
are you threatening my agents?

15:07.961 --> 15:09.895
You mean the men you sent
to follow and scare me?

15:09.996 --> 15:12.760
You told them you know
what I did to her. To who?

15:12.866 --> 15:13.992
- Amanda Tanner?
- Playing dumb doesn't suit you.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.692
Olivia, either say what you mean
or stop...

15:15.802 --> 15:19.932
War is war. Fine. But murder is murder!

15:28.648 --> 15:30.240
Amanda is dead?

15:38.692 --> 15:41.354
She has a dad.

15:41.461 --> 15:45.124
A really nice man
who's looking for his daughter.

15:45.265 --> 15:47.130
<i>How do you think he's gonna feel
when he finds out</i>

15:47.234 --> 15:50.328
that the man he voted for
had his daughter killed?

15:50.604 --> 15:52.162
<i>I didn't do this,</i>

15:53.974 --> 15:56.670
You know me. You know I didn't do this.

15:56.776 --> 15:57.743
<i>I don't know anything,</i>

15:58.178 --> 15:59.668
<i>Trust your gut,</i>

16:00.213 --> 16:01.510
Your gut's never wrong.

16:01.648 --> 16:04.310
I don't have a gut anymore.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.816
Livvie...

16:07.153 --> 16:09.144
Come to the White House
and look me in the eye.

16:09.256 --> 16:12.692
We need to talk about this, face to face.

16:12.826 --> 16:14.293
Face to face is over.

16:14.461 --> 16:16.122
That girl is dead.

16:16.229 --> 16:17.890
This wasn't me.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.067
You know me.

16:23.270 --> 16:26.728
And the thought that I would ever,
that I could ever...

16:29.309 --> 16:31.072
You know me.

16:31.177 --> 16:35.375
If you didn't kill her,
we both know who did.

16:35.482 --> 16:37.143
Tell me I'm wrong.

16:41.221 --> 16:44.520
You let a pit bull off his leash,
he mauls a baby,

16:44.624 --> 16:46.057
no one blames the dog.

16:46.159 --> 16:49.595
You let Cyrus off his leash.
That's on you.

17:02.275 --> 17:04.242
- Carly Reston?
- Yeah?

17:04.344 --> 17:05.935
You're a flight attendant
for Sky National?

17:06.046 --> 17:08.742
God! Look, I called in sick before
I went to bed last night,

17:08.848 --> 17:10.338
which is more than six hours
in advance.

17:10.450 --> 17:12.281
So if you couldn't find anyone to cover,
it's not my fault.

17:14.287 --> 17:16.550
You're not from corporate, are you?

17:17.958 --> 17:20.188
All of them? Everyone?

17:20.292 --> 17:21.281
Yes.

17:21.394 --> 17:23.589
- Sammi?
- All of them. Everyone.

17:29.369 --> 17:31.200
I need to know
if Captain Mackelson was drinking

17:31.304 --> 17:32.896
at your party at the bar last night.

17:33.006 --> 17:36.169
Lori? No way. She's been sober
for, like, a million years.

17:36.276 --> 17:37.971
Goes to meetings in every city
on the route.

17:38.111 --> 17:40.909
She almost never comes out with us,
anyway.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.275
The only reason
she even came out with us last night

17:44.384 --> 17:45.715
is 'cause it was my birthday.

17:51.424 --> 17:52.391
You didn't tell me

17:52.492 --> 17:53.652
Amanda Tanner used to work
in the White House.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.955
You didn't tell me
she had a previous suicide attempt.

17:56.062 --> 17:57.893
You pretty much didn't tell me
a single thing about the girl

17:57.998 --> 17:59.363
whom you tasked me with finding.

17:59.466 --> 18:01.434
So if I'm about to step
into political quicksand here,

18:01.534 --> 18:03.001
I'd like to know it before I sink.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.602
I can't tell you any more
than I've told you.

18:04.738 --> 18:06.205
But you know more.
And if you can't tell me more,

18:06.306 --> 18:07.796
then you're actually obstructing justice!

18:07.941 --> 18:09.101
I'm sorry, David.

18:14.314 --> 18:16.111
You know
what the flags are for?

18:16.216 --> 18:20.448
Yellow's where they picked up pieces
of the fuselage.

18:20.553 --> 18:21.781
Red's for body parts.

18:22.489 --> 18:24.787
I heard
one of the emergency workers talking.

18:26.726 --> 18:28.591
It's how they keep track
of whose parts are whose.

18:28.695 --> 18:30.253
Andrew, you should really get back.

18:30.363 --> 18:33.423
When my mom died,
we had an open casket.

18:34.067 --> 18:37.059
When my dad died
we had an open casket.

18:39.172 --> 18:40.605
It's how we say goodbye.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.975
What are my kids gonna see
when they look in Lori's casket?

18:48.515 --> 18:49.743
A red flag?

18:53.153 --> 18:56.247
I'd like to correct,
in the strongest terms possible,

18:56.756 --> 18:58.747
the idea that the pilot, Lori Mackelson,

18:58.858 --> 19:00.758
had been drinking
the night before the crash.

19:01.094 --> 19:02.652
She had not.

19:02.762 --> 19:05.162
And we have a witness to that effect.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.231
A little history about Lori.

19:09.703 --> 19:13.764
She was married to Andrew Mackelson
for 17 years.

19:13.907 --> 19:18.901
They have two boys. Carter, age 15,
and Jonathan, age 12.

19:32.425 --> 19:36.020
I don't want to ask you to do this,

19:36.129 --> 19:40.031
because it's not what you do anymore.

19:41.768 --> 19:42.962
You want the body.

19:44.504 --> 19:47.029
I know what I'm asking.

19:47.140 --> 19:49.165
And if it's too much for you,
if you don't want to,

19:49.275 --> 19:51.470
you can say no. That'll be the end of it.

19:51.578 --> 19:52.840
We'll find another way.

20:00.253 --> 20:01.652
I'll take care of it.

20:03.056 --> 20:06.219
Huck, you need reeling in, you call me.

20:07.393 --> 20:09.054
I'll come for you.

20:11.164 --> 20:12.495
I got this.

20:13.399 --> 20:14.923
I'm good to go.

20:16.402 --> 20:17.426
No problem.

20:32.819 --> 20:34.377
DiGrazzo flipped!

20:34.487 --> 20:35.613
It took a lot of pork

20:35.755 --> 20:38.519
and a guarantee of heavy campaigning
from you in New Jersey

20:38.625 --> 20:41.287
come mid-terms.
We're only two away now.

20:42.162 --> 20:43.356
Amanda Tanner's dead.

20:45.098 --> 20:46.087
How sad.

20:48.001 --> 20:49.263
Aren't you gonna ask how it happened?

20:49.969 --> 20:51.300
No. Should I?

20:51.437 --> 20:53.530
A young woman died.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.040
A member of this administration.

20:56.142 --> 20:57.905
I said how sad I was.

20:58.011 --> 21:01.572
You didn't hear me? I'll say it again.
How sad. Let's lower the flags.

21:01.681 --> 21:03.444
For God sakes, Cy, show some respect.

21:10.857 --> 21:14.190
120 innocent Americans. Children.

21:14.294 --> 21:16.626
Mommies and daddies and best friends
and husbands and wives

21:16.729 --> 21:19.994
died in that plane crash yesterday.
That's sad.

21:20.099 --> 21:23.159
We lost one of the few sane and worthy
members of the Senate yesterday.

21:23.269 --> 21:26.966
That's sad.
Four Navy Seals died in Afghanistan.

21:27.640 --> 21:32.168
And that doesn't even touch Sudan,
Congo, northern Mexico, that's sad.

21:32.278 --> 21:33.245
But the disturbed girl

21:33.346 --> 21:35.507
who made it her life's mission
to take down this administration,

21:35.615 --> 21:38.311
one who was happily, no, gleefully

21:38.418 --> 21:41.182
carrying your illegitimate bastard child,
she's no longer with us?

21:41.287 --> 21:43.084
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not sitting shivah.

21:43.690 --> 21:45.988
I'm sorry if I can't help
but see the millions of people

21:46.092 --> 21:48.219
that we'll actually be able to help

21:48.328 --> 21:51.229
now that Amanda Tanner is gone.
I am sorry,

21:52.198 --> 21:53.756
but this is a good thing.

21:54.033 --> 21:57.696
It is a good thing for us.
And it is a good thing for the country.

22:08.681 --> 22:10.012
What happened to McKinley?

22:10.116 --> 22:12.277
I was just getting used to seeing
his judge-y face every morning.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.080
He's being restored,
his judge-y face got flaky.

22:15.188 --> 22:17.247
What's your preference,
Madison or Van Buren?

22:17.357 --> 22:20.087
Van Buren has a certain wisdom
about him.

22:20.994 --> 22:21.961
What's bothering you?

22:23.496 --> 22:25.157
I think we're gonna pass
the DREAM Act.

22:25.265 --> 22:28.029
Cyrus is on it like a dog with a bone.

22:28.134 --> 22:29.396
You know, he called Sanchez' widow?

22:29.502 --> 22:30.935
Good. It needs to be passed.

22:31.037 --> 22:32.766
Still, there should be limits.
We're political animals,

22:32.872 --> 22:33.839
we're not animals.

22:35.174 --> 22:37.665
Sometimes I think
he's too willing to go to extremes.

22:39.245 --> 22:41.475
Tom, Hal, will you come here, please.

22:43.950 --> 22:45.440
- Tom?
- Yes, ma'am?

22:45.551 --> 22:47.075
You would take a bullet
for the President, wouldn't you?

22:47.420 --> 22:48.648
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hal?

22:48.755 --> 22:49.722
Yes, ma'am, I would.

22:49.822 --> 22:51.414
Thank you. That's all.

22:54.594 --> 22:55.583
There isn't a person in this building

22:55.695 --> 22:57.686
who isn't willing
to go to extremes for you.

23:03.336 --> 23:04.564
I got it.
- You got it?

23:04.704 --> 23:06.365
- Got what?
- Mechanic report. I got it.

23:06.606 --> 23:09.268
- How'd you get it?
- I got it.

23:09.976 --> 23:12.467
- Bet you did.
- I looked through 200 reports,

23:12.578 --> 23:14.307
every inspection made on this plane
in the last year.

23:14.414 --> 23:15.711
These are two separate reports.

23:15.815 --> 23:18.215
This one signed and dated
by a mechanic in Phoenix last fall.

23:18.351 --> 23:20.979
This one signed and dated
by a mechanic in Philly a week ago,

23:21.087 --> 23:22.554
the last inspection before the crash.

23:22.655 --> 23:23.952
No problems reported in either.

23:24.090 --> 23:26.081
That's bad for us, right?
That means the plane was fine?

23:26.225 --> 23:27.852
- Read line four.
Power control unit.

23:28.328 --> 23:29.852
Notice anything?
He misspelled control, but...

23:29.963 --> 23:31.692
- Line four.
It's misspelled here, too.

23:31.898 --> 23:33.695
What are the chances?
Identical reports.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.564
Signed by different mechanics
in different cities, months apart.

23:36.769 --> 23:37.736
The Philly report is fake.

23:37.837 --> 23:40.305
The last inspection of the plane
before it crashed was forged?

23:41.341 --> 23:42.638
<i>What's your status?</i>

23:42.775 --> 23:45.039
<i>Kick rudder,
Lori, left rudder, Left rudder!</i>

23:45.144 --> 23:47.772
<i>Sky National 684, what's your status?</i>

23:47.914 --> 23:49.176
<i>684, emergency!</i>

23:50.984 --> 23:53.384
<i>Left rudder! Left rudder!
What the hell are you...</i>

23:54.587 --> 23:56.179
<i>684, emergency!</i>

24:17.377 --> 24:18.537
Thank you.

24:20.713 --> 24:22.146
<i>684, emergency!</i>

24:43.970 --> 24:46.336
That is your signature?
- No, it is. But that's not my report.

24:46.506 --> 24:48.474
That's not my handwriting.
I wouldn't misspell "control,"

24:48.574 --> 24:49.768
I won my sixth grade spelling bee.

24:49.876 --> 24:51.707
You were the last one to inspect
the plane before it crashed.

24:51.811 --> 24:52.778
Can you tell me what you said
in your report?

24:52.879 --> 24:55.211
Hey. I just turn 'em in, all right?
This thing's not on me.

24:55.314 --> 24:56.713
I'm not here to blame you.

24:56.816 --> 24:59.341
I just want you to remember.
It's important.

25:00.186 --> 25:01.949
First, I would've checked the PCU,
then the summing levers.

25:02.055 --> 25:03.613
You wanna make sure they're okay,
'cause if they're not,

25:03.723 --> 25:05.714
you risk the rudder
deflecting to full blowdown limit.

25:05.825 --> 25:07.918
I'm trying to think if something
was going on with the levers.

25:08.027 --> 25:09.187
If there was,
I would've put the plane down.

25:11.564 --> 25:13.555
I seem to remember
recommending that for one of my birds.

25:13.666 --> 25:17.124
Hold it, slow down...
I don't wanna miss any of this.

25:18.104 --> 25:20.572
What exactly are you saying?
Are you saying...

25:20.673 --> 25:21.640
There's something wrong
with the plane.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.539
- What?
- She didn't panic.

25:23.643 --> 25:25.167
She didn't freeze.
She was doing everything right.

25:25.278 --> 25:26.575
That's what the noises are,
it's her responding,

25:26.712 --> 25:29.374
but it didn't matter 'cause there was
something wrong with the plane!

25:33.419 --> 25:35.114
I know, I know.

25:35.488 --> 25:37.820
Just showing up at someone's house,
it's so tacky.

25:39.192 --> 25:42.218
But we really do need to talk about
what happened to Amanda Tanner.

25:45.898 --> 25:47.365
Okay, Charlie?

25:50.069 --> 25:51.058
<i>Kick rudder, Lori, left rudder,</i>

25:51.170 --> 25:52.262
Right there. Hear that?

25:52.371 --> 25:55.135
Those three soft thumps?
They're there, trust me.

25:55.441 --> 25:56.840
- Trust him.
- It's the sound of Lori pushing

25:56.943 --> 25:59.309
on the left rudder, but the pedal
won't move. It won't let her go left.

25:59.445 --> 26:00.537
- Why not?
- The thing that makes the rudder

26:00.646 --> 26:02.113
go left or right.
According to the mechanic,

26:02.215 --> 26:03.204
one of its parts was bent.

26:03.316 --> 26:04.874
It'd be like making a right turn
in your car

26:04.984 --> 26:06.281
and having the steering wheel lock up
on you.

26:06.419 --> 26:09.877
The mechanic mentions the bent lever
in his report, but that report's gone.

26:10.957 --> 26:12.254
This is good, Andrew.

26:12.625 --> 26:13.592
We can use this.

26:13.693 --> 26:14.887
It means Lori did
everything in her power

26:14.994 --> 26:18.760
to stop the plane from going down.
It means it wasn't her fault.

26:19.298 --> 26:20.265
Then whose fault was it?

26:21.634 --> 26:23.295
My wife is dead.

26:24.337 --> 26:26.168
120 people are dead.

26:28.908 --> 26:30.000
Who's to blame for that?

26:33.779 --> 26:35.110
Well, we really appreciate
your help.

26:35.214 --> 26:39.116
And I know Senator Sanchez would,
too. This is a great way to honor him.

26:39.218 --> 26:41.413
We'll have you and Lynn over to dinner
at the residence next week.

26:41.721 --> 26:44.713
Okay. Thank you, Senator. Yep, bye.

26:45.892 --> 26:47.985
Jankowski is in!

26:48.161 --> 26:50.391
Well done, everyone!

26:50.496 --> 26:52.225
All right!

26:52.331 --> 26:54.629
As long as Brownhill's gallbladder
keeps him at home

26:55.301 --> 26:56.768
we have got a tie.

26:56.869 --> 27:00.134
And the deciding vote
is cast by the Vice President.

27:03.309 --> 27:05.777
I'm sorry, I tried again this morning,
but...

27:05.878 --> 27:07.470
Don't do this to me, Billy.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.772
We're gonna need one more.

27:09.382 --> 27:11.145
Get your boss up here.
This has gone far enough.

27:14.820 --> 27:17.118
I don't want you to think that
I'm doing this because I'm mad at you.

27:17.223 --> 27:19.054
I'm not. I'm not.

27:19.158 --> 27:21.820
You trained me
but it was the Agency, really.

27:21.961 --> 27:24.293
They took stuff from me,

27:24.397 --> 27:28.834
and not just my name or my ability
to ever contact my family again.

27:29.202 --> 27:31.932
I was young. I was fresh out of college

27:32.138 --> 27:34.402
and they made it sound fun.

27:34.507 --> 27:36.236
We had fun, didn't we?

27:36.342 --> 27:38.071
That's the problem.

27:38.177 --> 27:40.509
It's horrible. And it's sickening.

27:40.646 --> 27:44.673
And just when you think
you can't take anymore, it gets fun.

27:44.917 --> 27:47.750
The U.S. Government
really knows its stuff, yeah?

27:47.853 --> 27:52.017
Something in you just falls away
and it gets fun.

27:52.491 --> 27:56.086
There's a high. It's good. It's so good.

27:56.229 --> 27:58.561
Which is what I wanna remind you of,
how good it can get.

27:58.731 --> 28:02.963
You think about that. Okay?
I'm thinking about it.

28:03.069 --> 28:05.731
'Cause I'm rusty, I'm sober,

28:06.872 --> 28:09.397
this is gonna be bad for me for a while.

28:09.508 --> 28:12.909
But I'm gonna push
through the horrible and the sickening

28:13.012 --> 28:15.708
and then something's gonna fall away

28:15.815 --> 28:19.683
and I'm gonna start enjoying myself.
All right?

28:20.519 --> 28:24.546
And we both know
what an artist I can be.

28:27.393 --> 28:30.362
And like any junkie,
I'm gonna enjoy the high

28:30.463 --> 28:34.058
for as long as I can. Okay?

28:34.166 --> 28:36.396
You ready, old friend?

28:46.912 --> 28:49.278
Madam Vice President.

28:49.382 --> 28:51.077
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

28:51.217 --> 28:53.082
It's an honor
to be invited to the party, sir.

28:53.452 --> 28:54.919
I just came from a prayer meeting.

28:55.021 --> 28:56.750
You know how my people like to pray.

28:57.056 --> 28:59.115
- I do.
- My Cassidy was only 12 years old

28:59.225 --> 29:02.194
when I was deciding
whether or not to take the VP slot

29:02.295 --> 29:04.058
and she said, "Do it, Mama.

29:04.163 --> 29:06.154
"Governor Grant walks with the Lord. "

29:06.265 --> 29:07.994
Can you believe
she was only 12 years old?

29:08.134 --> 29:11.194
Very precocious, that Cassidy.

29:12.138 --> 29:13.799
We did it, Sally.

29:13.939 --> 29:15.634
The DREAM Act is tied in the Senate.

29:15.741 --> 29:18.209
And you will have the great honor
of casting the deciding vote.

29:18.311 --> 29:19.778
- Sir, I'm afraid that I...
- We made a hell of a team

29:19.879 --> 29:22.211
out on the campaign trail, didn't we?

29:22.315 --> 29:25.409
The children of illegal immigrants
should not be allowed to take part

29:25.518 --> 29:28.453
in the bounty of America, Mr. President.
That is not God's plan.

29:28.554 --> 29:30.852
I will never forget the way
you brought those people to their feet

29:30.990 --> 29:34.255
in Utah. Rain pouring down
on 10,000 tired people

29:34.360 --> 29:36.692
and they jumped up like a Baptist choir.

29:36.796 --> 29:39.162
That is the closest I've ever seen
to political magic.

29:39.298 --> 29:41.027
I'm not saying
that they shouldn't be allowed

29:41.133 --> 29:43.226
to partake in certain paths
to legal immigration.

29:43.369 --> 29:44.961
You're an experienced politician,

29:45.071 --> 29:48.131
and a woman of God.
So I'm not gonna waste your time

29:48.240 --> 29:49.468
by trying to talk you into something

29:49.575 --> 29:51.770
that you've obviously
given a lot of serious thought to.

29:51.877 --> 29:55.904
So let's just get right to it.
You intend to be President one day.

29:56.649 --> 29:58.207
- Sir, I...
- And whatever our disagreements,

29:58.451 --> 30:00.214
this country could use
a woman President.

30:00.319 --> 30:02.787
But of the 14 Vice Presidents
in our history

30:02.888 --> 30:04.651
who have gone on
to assume the Presidency,

30:04.757 --> 30:06.122
do you know how many have done so

30:06.225 --> 30:08.591
without the endorsement
of the President they served?

30:08.994 --> 30:09.983
None, sir.

30:12.465 --> 30:15.662
We're going to do great things together,
you and I.

30:15.768 --> 30:17.167
Great things.

30:17.269 --> 30:19.260
And we're going to start
by passing the DREAM Act.

30:22.007 --> 30:23.167
Sir.

30:24.143 --> 30:25.838
It's my honor, sir.

30:29.749 --> 30:30.716
Cyrus.

30:35.888 --> 30:37.947
She's in. Deal closed. We're good.

30:38.057 --> 30:39.251
Bill will pass, no problem,

30:39.358 --> 30:41.724
or I will tear her right wing guts out.

30:42.027 --> 30:42.994
I'm back.

30:44.463 --> 30:46.055
I am back.

30:51.036 --> 30:52.060
Cyrus.

30:53.172 --> 30:54.230
Cyrus?

30:55.908 --> 30:58.240
We got a blackmail letter. A demand.

30:58.811 --> 31:00.278
It's not Olivia. It's not Amanda.

31:00.379 --> 31:03.109
Olivia's not this crazy
and Amanda's dead.

31:04.383 --> 31:06.283
Which means there's someone else.
A third party.

31:06.385 --> 31:09.013
Olivia did not send us that sex tape.
Someone else did.

31:09.121 --> 31:11.385
Cyrus. What's the demand?

31:16.796 --> 31:19.560
Oh, Charlie.
You make a beautiful noise.

31:20.399 --> 31:24.301
They did, you know, take stuff from me,
the U.S. Government.

31:24.403 --> 31:26.496
After I started not being able to sleep,

31:26.605 --> 31:29.597
after I started crying
when I wrapped a guy in plastic,

31:29.708 --> 31:33.041
they put me in a hole
nobody wants to be in.

31:33.145 --> 31:37.104
And I don't mean a metaphorical hole.
I mean an actual hole.

31:37.783 --> 31:40.980
They took stuff from me, Charlie.

31:41.086 --> 31:43.714
So much stuff that I was homeless
on the subway

31:43.823 --> 31:46.121
begging for change when Liv found me,

31:46.225 --> 31:49.524
which is why I'm breaking my sobriety,
'cause she asked. Okay?

31:49.628 --> 31:51.994
And I'm telling you this
because I want you to understand

31:52.097 --> 31:54.122
that I owe her.

31:54.233 --> 31:57.828
So I'm not gonna stop
until you tell me where Amanda is.

31:57.970 --> 31:59.062
You get that?

32:04.743 --> 32:06.506
Tell me where she is.

32:09.181 --> 32:14.312
Charlie. I have a scalpel. A ten blade.

32:14.420 --> 32:16.388
I will peel you like a grape.

32:18.491 --> 32:21.551
You're gonna retire to New Mexico.
It's nice there.

32:22.027 --> 32:25.827
But, first, you're gonna tell me
where Amanda Tanner's body is.

32:26.432 --> 32:27.990
All right?

32:30.035 --> 32:31.002
Okay.

32:39.011 --> 32:40.740
Alissa, you're fired again.

32:43.849 --> 32:44.838
What?

32:44.950 --> 32:46.918
Fourteenth Street Bridge.

32:47.553 --> 32:49.180
You're gonna need a diving team.

32:51.590 --> 32:53.057
Are you okay?

32:54.994 --> 32:56.518
Not really.

33:01.700 --> 33:02.689
Okay.

33:03.168 --> 33:04.396
Okay.

33:06.906 --> 33:07.873
<i>Good evening,</i>

33:09.074 --> 33:11.542
<i>This is the 37 th time</i>

33:11.977 --> 33:14.309
<i>I have spoken to you from this office,</i>

33:14.813 --> 33:18.180
<i>I would have preferred
to carry through to the finish,</i>

33:19.485 --> 33:21.749
<i>whatever the personal agony
it would have involved,</i>

33:24.957 --> 33:28.415
<i>Therefore, I shall resign the presidency</i>

33:28.527 --> 33:31.223
<i>effective at noon tomorrow,</i>

33:32.865 --> 33:34.765
<i>As we look to the future,</i>

33:34.867 --> 33:38.894
<i>the first essential is to begin healing
the wounds of this nation,</i>

33:39.638 --> 33:43.836
<i>to put the bitterness,
divisions of the recent past behind us,</i>

33:45.277 --> 33:51.739
<i>I hope that I will have hastened
the start of that process of healing</i>

33:52.351 --> 33:55.377
<i>which is so desperately needed
in America,</i>

34:00.359 --> 34:02.520
What exactly are you insinuating,
Ms. Pope?

34:02.628 --> 34:06.689
I don't like to insinuate.
I'd rather deduce likely scenarios.

34:06.799 --> 34:08.027
And in my scenario,

34:08.132 --> 34:11.569
you get a mechanic's report that says
you have to ground all your MW-85s,

34:11.670 --> 34:13.001
which would cost you millions

34:13.105 --> 34:15.130
and send your customers
running to your competitors.

34:15.574 --> 34:18.042
You'd worry about what
your stockholders are going to say.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.235
You'd worry about your job.
That's understandable.

34:20.346 --> 34:22.210
If I'm the CEO,
it's the last thing I'd want.

34:22.313 --> 34:24.873
So, one report goes missing.
No harm, no foul.

34:24.984 --> 34:27.350
That is,
until 120 people fall out of the sky.

34:27.453 --> 34:29.614
This is not some kind of conspiracy
if that's what...

34:29.955 --> 34:31.320
She doesn't insinuate. She deduces.

34:33.425 --> 34:37.156
I started this airline with one plane,
two pilots

34:37.262 --> 34:40.060
and an old furniture warehouse
converted to a hangar.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.463
I lost seven employees yesterday.

34:42.568 --> 34:46.664
The senior flight attendant,
Sammi Tyler, was one of my first hires.

34:46.772 --> 34:50.208
Believe me,
I want the truth just as much as you do.

34:50.442 --> 34:52.569
So why did this report disappear?

34:52.878 --> 34:54.708
Why didn't it get passed up the line?

34:55.014 --> 34:56.072
I don't know.

34:56.447 --> 34:57.881
Somebody does.

35:07.526 --> 35:09.187
Phyllis Hayes?

35:09.795 --> 35:11.490
I'm Harrison Wright. I'm here to...

35:11.597 --> 35:13.622
I know why you're here, Mr. Wright.

35:15.668 --> 35:17.829
Two people used to do my job
and now it's just me.

35:17.936 --> 35:20.370
That's not an excuse.
It just means things pile up.

35:20.506 --> 35:23.407
I had a huge backlog of mechanic
reports from all over the country

35:23.542 --> 35:25.840
and I had to get them out,
push them up the ladder.

35:25.944 --> 35:28.412
They fire you if you don't get them in
on time at headquarters.

35:28.947 --> 35:31.040
My youngest daughter
was having a piano recital

35:31.150 --> 35:32.811
and I didn't wanna miss it.

35:32.918 --> 35:35.648
I already missed one this year.

35:39.091 --> 35:41.025
So I duplicated one of the reports.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.728
I didn't think it was a big deal.

35:44.430 --> 35:46.864
I believe this is what you're looking for.

35:47.933 --> 35:49.491
I'm never going to hear her play

35:49.601 --> 35:52.798
without thinking about
all those people.

35:56.408 --> 35:59.900
She's very good at the piano,
my daughter.

36:00.579 --> 36:03.309
I'm sure she is, Ms. Hayes.

36:06.385 --> 36:09.252
I've come here tonight
to express my sincere condolences

36:09.354 --> 36:12.152
to the victims and the families
of Flight 684.

36:12.458 --> 36:15.621
As of this afternoon,
Sky National has participated fully

36:15.728 --> 36:18.219
in the NTSB investigation,

36:18.330 --> 36:23.290
and we understand and accept our role
in the events leading up to the crash.

36:23.669 --> 36:27.628
So I would like to take this time
to apologize

36:27.740 --> 36:30.903
to all those who lost loved ones
in this tragic event,

36:31.009 --> 36:32.772
including the families of the crew

36:32.878 --> 36:34.505
and of Captain Lori Mackelson

36:34.613 --> 36:38.709
who fought so valiantly until the end
to prevent this terrible tragedy.

36:40.319 --> 36:41.286
Thank you.

36:50.429 --> 36:52.454
That's Mandy.

36:52.564 --> 36:54.327
This is my daughter.

37:06.578 --> 37:07.738
She didn't suffer.

37:09.748 --> 37:11.147
How do you...

37:13.552 --> 37:15.713
'Cause I know what you do to people
to make them suffer.

37:16.688 --> 37:18.417
She didn't suffer.

37:19.091 --> 37:22.788
It was a good death.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.703
Thank you.

37:37.643 --> 37:39.076
It's okay.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.154
Hal, Tom.

37:54.293 --> 37:57.126
Can you guys come in here
a second, please?

38:01.166 --> 38:02.656
What if I wanted to get out of here?

38:03.669 --> 38:05.296
- Sir?
- The Press Corps lid is on,

38:05.404 --> 38:07.838
staff has all gone home.
What if I wanted to leave?

38:07.940 --> 38:09.965
I don't think that...
That's not possible, sir.

38:10.108 --> 38:11.575
You're gonna tell me 41 never left?

38:11.944 --> 38:13.104
Forty-three never went out for a drink?

38:14.012 --> 38:15.445
Okay, seriously, 42?

38:15.814 --> 38:18.180
Bill Clinton?
William Jefferson Clinton never left?

38:18.283 --> 38:19.250
I wouldn't know about past presidents...

38:19.351 --> 38:20.943
Kennedy never left the White House
in secret?

38:21.119 --> 38:23.053
- What am I, born yesterday?
- Sir, we have no knowledge of a...

38:23.155 --> 38:26.750
Fine. I wanna go somewhere
spontaneously. How do I do that?

38:26.859 --> 38:29.384
I would inform our immediate supervisor
at the Secret Service,

38:29.494 --> 38:30.722
who'd inform
the Head of the Secret Service

38:30.829 --> 38:32.057
and the White House Press Secretary,

38:32.164 --> 38:33.461
who'd inform
the White House Press Corps.

38:33.565 --> 38:35.032
150 individuals would assemble,

38:35.133 --> 38:36.998
along with
your bulletproof Presidential limousine,

38:37.135 --> 38:38.727
your chase and follow car,
your ambulance,

38:39.037 --> 38:40.004
two unmarked vehicles

38:40.105 --> 38:41.333
as well as the sharpshooters
and Marine Guard...

38:41.440 --> 38:43.908
- No.
- Sir?

38:44.009 --> 38:45.704
What if I wanted
to go somewhere alone?

38:45.811 --> 38:49.440
No Secret Service,
no press, no anything.

38:49.915 --> 38:51.246
Technically,
the President of the United States

38:51.350 --> 38:54.114
is allowed to refuse the protection
of the Secret Service but...

38:54.419 --> 38:55.716
But, what?

38:55.821 --> 38:58.119
It needs to be approved
by the Secretary of the Treasury, sir.

38:58.223 --> 38:59.781
And recorded in the national record.

38:59.892 --> 39:01.792
- I'm not a prisoner.
No, sir.

39:01.894 --> 39:03.828
I am the most powerful man
on the planet.

39:03.929 --> 39:05.453
Yes, sir.
- But I can't leave my house?

39:05.564 --> 39:06.622
No, sir.
- You see where I might be

39:06.732 --> 39:07.790
a little annoyed?

39:07.900 --> 39:09.060
Yes, sir.

39:10.335 --> 39:12.735
I am a grown man.

39:14.273 --> 39:15.831
I'm going to leave here.

39:15.974 --> 39:17.566
If I have to walk out
to the staff parking lot

39:17.676 --> 39:20.577
with you two following me,
jump into someone's 1994 Civic

39:20.679 --> 39:24.080
and drive off without protection,
I am going to leave.

39:24.182 --> 39:25.615
I would like to be safe

39:25.784 --> 39:28.480
and not jeopardize the economy
of this country when I did so.

39:29.354 --> 39:30.821
Can you come up with a way
to make that happen?

39:33.125 --> 39:35.958
Two sedans, covered parking.
One sharpshooter and your ambulance.

39:36.061 --> 39:38.723
One sedan and covered parking.
No sharpshooters and no ambulance.

39:38.864 --> 39:40.923
One sedan, covered parking,
no sharpshooters,

39:41.033 --> 39:42.625
we keep the ambulance
and add two agents.

39:43.302 --> 39:44.428
Sold.

39:48.740 --> 39:49.707
Just like 43.

39:49.808 --> 39:51.503
Yep.

39:56.715 --> 40:01.778
Personal belongings
on her body, no sign of foul play,

40:01.887 --> 40:04.287
slashed her wrists a month ago.

40:04.790 --> 40:08.021
Cops wanna rule it a suicide,

40:08.126 --> 40:09.923
coroner wants to rule it a suicide.

40:10.062 --> 40:12.553
So it's gonna be ruled a suicide?

40:12.664 --> 40:13.961
Yep.

40:17.135 --> 40:19.330
So, who do you think killed her?

40:22.107 --> 40:26.203
See, I've got this nagging feeling
you've got a pretty good idea.

40:27.179 --> 40:30.114
I know I give you a long leash
on a lot of things.

40:30.215 --> 40:32.911
And I like to,
because despite my better judgment

40:33.018 --> 40:37.614
and all my protests to the contrary,
I really do consider you a friend.

40:37.723 --> 40:39.987
But I can't look the other way here.
Not on this.

40:40.225 --> 40:44.025
I'm an Assistant U.S. Attorney, Liv.
I prosecute crime.

40:44.129 --> 40:45.391
I get the bad guys.

40:45.864 --> 40:48.731
So at some point, even with you,
I gotta draw the line.

40:49.301 --> 40:50.962
I gotta do my job,

40:52.270 --> 40:53.635
gotta be the sheriff.

40:55.674 --> 40:57.665
The white hat looks good on you.

41:03.115 --> 41:04.139
Lisa.

41:04.616 --> 41:07.813
I'm gonna need that autopsy report
fast-tracked, as soon as you can.

41:07.919 --> 41:09.944
Well, I can tell you right now
it's gonna be a suicide.

41:10.055 --> 41:11.852
I'm still gonna need the report.

41:14.393 --> 41:16.224
Are you still engaged?

41:21.333 --> 41:25.030
Not so engaged
that I don't remember the freezer.

41:28.774 --> 41:29.741
Hey!

41:29.941 --> 41:31.704
I left you ten messages. I just heard.

41:31.877 --> 41:33.742
It's horrible. I couldn't reach you,
I didn't know what to do

41:33.845 --> 41:36.643
so I just started making grilled cheese,
because it's literally the only thing

41:36.748 --> 41:38.682
I know how to make
and it's comfort food

41:38.784 --> 41:40.411
and I figured you'd be hungry and you...

41:42.320 --> 41:43.378
Quinn, are you okay?

41:54.032 --> 41:56.227
<i>Congressman Mike Tans of Indiana</i>

41:56.334 --> 42:00.327
<i>welcoming compromise, or cautioning
against taking too much credit...</i>

42:00.505 --> 42:01.665
What? Wait. Hold on.

42:01.773 --> 42:04.241
Coming! Stephen.

42:04.342 --> 42:05.309
It's not his.

42:05.577 --> 42:07.272
<i>- What?
- I just got the coroner's report,</i>

42:07.446 --> 42:09.710
The blood types don't match.
Amanda was pregnant,

42:10.082 --> 42:11.982
<i>but the baby was not the President's,</i>

42:12.651 --> 42:14.949
<i>Liv? Liv, are you there?</i>

42:16.788 --> 42:18.119
Hi.

42:19.624 --> 42:20.750
Hi.
