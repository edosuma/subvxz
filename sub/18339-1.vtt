05:03.535 --> 05:05.971
Alright,
on my count, go, go, go.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.517
Clear.

05:10.642 --> 05:12.519
Watch that corner.

05:12.644 --> 05:15.415
Hands, let me see your hands.

05:17.082 --> 05:19.319
Got you...

06:08.066 --> 06:09.769
Stuck up.

06:13.672 --> 06:16.142
Hey, move it, gringo.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.522
- Hey, John.
- Hola, chica.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.482
Do you guys need anything?

06:23.607 --> 06:26.660
Nope, we'll be fine,
thanks, we're cool.

06:26.785 --> 06:27.953
You hear that song?

06:28.078 --> 06:30.597
In terms of the latest
narco quarter

06:30.722 --> 06:32.792
that we're interested in,
that was set up by El Mini Oso.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.693
<i>Now, interestingly enough,</i>

06:34.818 --> 06:37.338
<i>it's been taken over</i>
<i>by Felix Camarena.</i>

06:37.463 --> 06:40.699
Oso was an ex-cop who at the
time of Camarena's first arrest

06:40.824 --> 06:43.344
ran the Puento Grande
Mexican prison.

06:43.469 --> 06:46.747
Oso made sure to help set up
Camarena's first prison break.

06:46.872 --> 06:49.708
I'm not sure who helped him
the second time around really.

06:49.833 --> 06:52.553
But Camarena did
return the favor.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.955
In February, my team
raided his compound.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.716
<i>As you may, or may not,</i>
<i>know when we got in there</i>

06:57.841 --> 07:02.154
<i>we encountered severe resistance,
got into a big gun fight.</i>

07:03.747 --> 07:06.526
<i>I ended up killing El Mini Oso.</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:19.380
<i>We had 200 million dollars</i>
<i>in cash, some Euros,</i>

07:19.505 --> 07:24.610
<i>over 100 big exotic cats,
200 firearms, most of them FA,</i>

07:24.735 --> 07:27.421
and 150 tons of cocaine.

07:27.546 --> 07:31.658
- I ended that motherfucker.
- That's why I'm here, John.

07:31.783 --> 07:33.093
You killed the bear.

07:33.218 --> 07:35.721
I don't need to tell you
about your reputation

07:35.846 --> 07:37.598
on both sides of the law.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.025
The cartels know that you're
someone to be reckoned with

07:40.150 --> 07:43.570
and the FBI and ICE
know that as a purported agent

07:43.695 --> 07:46.699
of the DEA, you're also
in bed with the CIA.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.236
Do you need to get that?

07:50.361 --> 07:52.713
Fuck no.

07:52.838 --> 07:56.750
Look, I'm here,
off the books, because I need to

07:56.875 --> 07:58.010
reactivate a cold asset.

07:58.135 --> 08:01.981
My brother, if I get back in,
there's 1,000 motherfuckers

08:02.106 --> 08:05.092
that are gonna die,
good guys and bad guys,

08:05.217 --> 08:07.628
and I'm gonna end up
being the bad guy,

08:07.753 --> 08:08.962
and I don't want that.

08:09.087 --> 08:11.724
In the past several weeks
ICE has been picking up

08:11.849 --> 08:15.736
more and more OTM's along
Sonora smuggling routes.

08:15.861 --> 08:17.796
<i>ICE runs across</i>
<i>them all the time.</i>

08:17.921 --> 08:20.266
<i>Mexicans being smuggled
in all the time.</i>

08:20.391 --> 08:22.735
<i>Nuh-uh, not like this.</i>

08:22.860 --> 08:27.707
<i>Two days ago ICE picked up two
OTM's along the Texas border.</i>

08:30.576 --> 08:32.719
This close to making it across.

08:32.844 --> 08:35.548
But your Native American friends
working the routes that night

08:35.673 --> 08:37.783
<i>noticed something</i>
<i>different about these two.</i>

08:37.908 --> 08:40.285
<i>Let me guess,</i>
<i>you got a hit on an OTM.</i>

08:40.410 --> 08:43.797
Two hits. Two known
Islamic extremists, John.

08:43.922 --> 08:46.125
Two of the three main players
responsible for blowing

08:46.250 --> 08:49.929
Crimea A-450 out of the
sky over Syria last year.

09:06.878 --> 09:11.124
As you know the CIA in concert
with the DEA and the FBI

09:11.249 --> 09:13.093
have been after these animals.

09:13.218 --> 09:14.753
Each belong to
different groups though.

09:14.878 --> 09:17.990
Split between Al-Nusra Front
and Hezbollah.

09:18.115 --> 09:21.961
So you're talking high level,
high value targets.

09:22.086 --> 09:25.672
Wow.
I'm interested, tell me more.

09:25.797 --> 09:27.641
DOJ has reasons to
believe that these guys

09:27.766 --> 09:29.335
are attempting to form
an unholy alliance

09:29.460 --> 09:31.812
with the narco terrorists
along our borders.

09:31.937 --> 09:34.006
Same cartels that create
men like El Mini Oso.

09:34.131 --> 09:35.808
Now the agreement
is simple in theory.

09:35.933 --> 09:38.519
Their caliphate will supply
the cartels if the cartels

09:38.644 --> 09:40.679
use their smuggling routes
to sneak terrorist cells

09:40.804 --> 09:42.556
into the US undetected.

09:42.681 --> 09:45.184
The FBI doesn't want it
and the CIA can't do anything

09:45.309 --> 09:48.161
about it once they
land on US soil.

09:48.286 --> 09:50.163
And that leaves the DEA.

09:51.949 --> 09:53.767
And that brings you to me.

09:53.892 --> 09:55.794
You're the best
wet mechanic out there, John,

09:55.919 --> 09:59.765
and a very unique asset,
straddling both worlds,

09:59.890 --> 10:01.667
the CIA and the DEA.

10:03.935 --> 10:09.249
Okay, so, I'm gonna
need something actionable.

10:09.374 --> 10:11.877
There is a meeting taking place
marking the marriage

10:12.002 --> 10:14.922
between these groups,
making it official.

10:15.047 --> 10:16.949
Where is the
meeting taking place?

10:17.074 --> 10:18.083
Neutral ground.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.794
But the exact location,
we don't know.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.888
Stay and drink with us, baby.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.613
Don't be shy.

10:29.861 --> 10:31.897
Okay, so here's the deal.

10:32.022 --> 10:35.876
If I'm coming in to do this,
I need resources.

10:36.001 --> 10:39.813
I want to pick my own team,
I want my own equipment,

10:39.938 --> 10:44.376
my own gear, and I'll need a jet
to tote me and my team around.

10:44.501 --> 10:46.787
So I guess you're back.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.156
My account info,
same as usual.

10:49.281 --> 10:52.117
And I want to talk
to the OTM tonight.

10:52.242 --> 10:54.286
Now if you'll excuse me.

10:58.148 --> 10:59.425
Just stay, relax.

11:04.062 --> 11:07.107
- Hey, Maria, Maria.
- Hi, papi.

11:07.232 --> 11:09.902
- How's my baby.
- Who's this guy?

11:10.027 --> 11:12.913
- How's my baby girl?
- Not that good.

11:13.038 --> 11:13.739
Not that good,
what's happening?

11:13.864 --> 11:15.882
- Because of them.
- Really?

11:16.007 --> 11:17.242
Hey, who the fuck are you?

11:17.367 --> 11:19.311
Do you guys know
this is my baby?

11:19.436 --> 11:20.746
You're baby?

11:23.307 --> 11:25.325
But you know what,
it seems to me...

11:25.450 --> 11:26.385
Seems that what?

11:26.510 --> 11:29.154
- Is this your beer?
- Yeah.

11:29.279 --> 11:30.964
Hey,<i>ese.</i>

11:31.089 --> 11:31.957
He took your beer, man.

11:32.082 --> 11:35.936
It seems to me that
you're bothering her.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.473
Stay down, bitch.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.971
I was never here.
You understand that right?

12:36.922 --> 12:37.990
<i>Hello.</i>

12:38.115 --> 12:39.958
<i>Zara, it's me.</i>

12:40.083 --> 12:43.470
<i>John, wow,
it's been a long time.</i>

12:43.595 --> 12:47.340
<i>How's Mexico or wherever</i>
<i>you're living these days?</i>

12:47.465 --> 12:50.235
<i>I'm coming back home,</i>
<i>good old USA.</i>

12:50.360 --> 12:53.038
<i>I need your help for something.</i>

12:58.143 --> 13:01.113
Alright let's try an easy one.
Where are you from?

13:24.135 --> 13:27.214
Okay, I see you
recognize the word.

13:27.339 --> 13:31.518
So, probably you didn't
count on me grabbing you.

13:31.643 --> 13:34.112
And because you were trained
to sit tight and not say

13:34.237 --> 13:37.324
a word, then you'll probably
be kicked loose by dawn

13:37.449 --> 13:38.617
because that's where our current

13:38.742 --> 13:43.130
administration
makes all of us act.

13:43.255 --> 13:47.026
You didn't count on my Native
American brothers grabbing you,

13:48.126 --> 13:50.871
<i>and I'm sure they</i>
<i>took one look at you</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:52.431
<i>and saw you a mile away.</i>

13:52.556 --> 13:54.174
You're an Arab.

13:54.299 --> 13:56.035
You're no Mexican.

14:02.374 --> 14:03.884
Your clothes ill-fitting.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.486
Eh, you look kind of
Yemeni with a neck scarf.

14:06.611 --> 14:07.546
But your friend
from the other room,

14:07.671 --> 14:10.082
he's not from there is he?

14:14.185 --> 14:16.054
Of course you do,
he's already rolled on you.

14:16.179 --> 14:20.534
How do you think
I know you're Yemeni. You know?

14:20.659 --> 14:25.197
He tells me that the Al-Qaeda
and the Arabian peninsula

14:25.322 --> 14:27.574
are very active.

14:27.699 --> 14:31.203
But you guys aren't
usually found hanging out

14:31.328 --> 14:33.238
with the Al-Nusra Front.

14:33.363 --> 14:37.884
AQAP working with Daish, yeah?

14:38.009 --> 14:41.855
This tells me that you
and your pal aren't really

14:41.980 --> 14:44.549
trial running anything
to set up smuggling routes.

14:44.674 --> 14:49.029
This tells me
you're forward negotiators

14:49.154 --> 14:53.058
setting the stage for something
big that's about to happen.

14:54.292 --> 14:56.536
I do not speak English.

14:56.661 --> 14:59.039
Man that's some funny shit.

14:59.164 --> 15:03.043
I also know who caught
the eye of the border agents

15:03.168 --> 15:04.670
when they nabbed you guys.

15:04.795 --> 15:08.206
See, Native Americans
are experts at tracking

15:08.331 --> 15:11.084
and...
and the thing of it is

15:11.209 --> 15:14.413
you weren't sneaking in
from Mexico to the US.

15:14.538 --> 15:18.984
<i>You were sneaking out of</i>
<i>the US into Mexico.</i>

15:19.985 --> 15:21.585
<i>You were already here.</i>

15:23.321 --> 15:24.723
So tell me your name,

15:24.848 --> 15:28.335
tell me the name
of your contact in Mexico

15:28.460 --> 15:30.262
and finally tell me exactly

15:30.387 --> 15:34.266
where the real meeting
is taking place and when.

15:42.173 --> 15:45.552
My name is Abdulah Al-Hamdani.

15:45.677 --> 15:50.515
Our contact in Mexico is the
head of the Sonora drug cartel.

15:50.640 --> 15:55.187
<i>He wanted to show us his</i>
<i>southern border operations.</i>

16:04.029 --> 16:06.331
<i>So you were kind of</i>
<i>inspecting the routes, right?</i>

16:06.456 --> 16:07.507
<i>For the corridors?</i>

16:07.632 --> 16:10.502
<i>We were making
an alliance of convenience.</i>

16:10.627 --> 16:12.371
<i>Yeah, I understand that.</i>

16:12.496 --> 16:18.385
Mexico isn't really interesting
enough without AQAP and Daish.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.245
We have enough
desert back home.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.381
Yes, you do,
and that's why I know

16:22.506 --> 16:24.157
you're still lying to me.

16:24.282 --> 16:26.251
You're here for an
easier way into the US.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.387
Something with less eyes on it.

16:28.512 --> 16:30.563
<i>With more sand.</i>

16:30.688 --> 16:34.601
<i>Something further away,
but still a hub, a port,</i>

16:34.726 --> 16:38.663
<i>with a history of trafficking</i>
<i>as well as religion.</i>

16:38.788 --> 16:42.275
Your contact in Mexico
was Jose Rivera.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.112
But that's not where the
meeting is taking place.

16:46.237 --> 16:47.773
How do you know his name?

16:47.898 --> 16:50.275
Rivera's the head
of Sonora cartel.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.988
And if you're making a deal with
any cartel, it's with Sonora.

16:55.113 --> 16:58.216
<i>You want the access to</i>
<i>their extensive rain time,</i>

16:58.341 --> 17:01.720
<i>subterranean land</i>
<i>and air smuggling route.</i>

17:01.845 --> 17:05.758
And you like the fact
that they're brutal.

17:10.862 --> 17:14.540
Rivera's expanding into Turkey.

17:16.701 --> 17:19.145
How could you
possibly know that?

17:19.270 --> 17:22.741
'Cause I've been in Mexico
for a long time working Rivera.

17:22.866 --> 17:26.144
He hasn't been in Mexico,
he's been in Turkey.

17:26.269 --> 17:30.282
And he's been taking out
all the heroin godfathers

17:30.407 --> 17:33.193
<i>one by one by one.</i>

17:48.266 --> 17:50.469
<i>You see a storm's coming.</i>

18:18.496 --> 18:21.366
So other than a switch from
the Agency to the Bureau,

18:21.491 --> 18:24.302
you haven't changed a bit
since last time I saw you.

18:24.427 --> 18:27.172
I could say the same
thing about you, John.

18:27.297 --> 18:29.582
Still wearing the Rolex.

18:29.707 --> 18:34.479
Yeah, it's platinum. I got this
from finest girl I ever had.

18:34.604 --> 18:38.383
- Yeah, from me.
- Yeah, it was you.

18:41.586 --> 18:46.158
- How you been?
- I'm alright. You know me.

18:46.283 --> 18:49.135
Yeah, I know you.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.496
So, you really
think this meeting

18:51.621 --> 18:55.075
is taking place in
Istanbul and not Mexico?

18:55.200 --> 18:57.277
I mean, I never
really believe intel.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.904
You believe intel,
we used to say,

18:59.029 --> 19:01.473
and that's the key
to death, you know.

19:01.598 --> 19:06.244
You can never trust intel.
But that's what they say.

19:06.369 --> 19:09.322
Okay.
I'll write it up and pass it

19:09.447 --> 19:12.158
on over to our old CIA contacts.

19:12.283 --> 19:13.885
Baby, that's not
why I asked you to come.

19:14.010 --> 19:17.422
I was thinking I might get
you to come back on my team.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.291
Oh, I figured...

19:20.892 --> 19:22.702
You've been reactivated.

19:22.827 --> 19:26.339
We need one more person to
complete our three-man team.

19:26.464 --> 19:28.533
Better if somebody's
kind of internal,

19:28.658 --> 19:33.813
maybe with Agency connections,
not really DEA or FBI.

19:33.938 --> 19:37.250
What do you propose we do?
This three-man team of yours.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.844
You know we find folks,
we interview 'em.

19:39.969 --> 19:42.822
If we like 'em we give
'em a box of chocolates.

19:42.947 --> 19:44.382
If we don't, we kill 'em.

19:44.507 --> 19:47.386
- And then?
- And then...

19:49.287 --> 19:51.464
I will do my thing.

19:51.589 --> 19:53.658
I thought those
days were behind us.

19:53.783 --> 19:57.203
Naw, man, our best days
are ahead of us, girl.

19:57.328 --> 20:00.565
I need a good SIGN guy
who can provide me with

20:00.690 --> 20:05.678
minute-by-minute intel
and some real time images.

20:05.803 --> 20:08.974
These days
you're talking drones.

20:10.975 --> 20:12.577
So what do you need me for?

20:12.702 --> 20:16.756
I need you by my
side to watch my six

20:16.881 --> 20:20.493
and do what you do best.

20:20.618 --> 20:22.520
<i>His name's Matthew Sharp.</i>

20:22.645 --> 20:23.754
<i>SIGN all the way,</i>

20:23.879 --> 20:27.233
<i>but five years of HUMINT</i>
<i>training before that.</i>

20:27.358 --> 20:29.361
<i>How long with the Agency?</i>

20:29.486 --> 20:31.763
<i>- Fifteen years.</i>
<i>- Before that?</i>

20:31.888 --> 20:34.499
<i>Army, Special Forces.</i>

20:36.734 --> 20:39.604
<i>Doesn't have much else</i>
<i>in his jacket about that.</i>

20:39.729 --> 20:41.506
<i>Yeah, probably wouldn't.</i>

20:50.948 --> 20:53.351
Am I meeting this guy?
He's late.

20:53.476 --> 20:56.788
He picked the time
and the place.

20:56.913 --> 20:58.398
Yeah.

21:02.694 --> 21:06.832
Uh, John, that thing's
coming in pretty low.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.748
I think it's locked
on to your truck.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.647
Shit, he's locked on to my car.

21:33.991 --> 21:36.269
John.

21:36.394 --> 21:39.865
- Let him go.
- But it's carrying an AR.

21:43.434 --> 21:45.870
- John.
- Let him go.

22:04.422 --> 22:06.625
Okay, that got my attention.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.392
John.

22:12.764 --> 22:14.440
John.

22:29.847 --> 22:31.891
You must be Sharp?

22:32.016 --> 22:33.393
You must be John Harmon.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.120
Yeah, I'm Harmon,
but I'm still waiting

22:35.245 --> 22:37.722
for the answer to my question.

22:37.847 --> 22:39.565
Yeah, Matthew Sharp.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.026
That's some pretty nice
piloting you did out there.

22:42.151 --> 22:44.563
I might have a job for you.

22:52.937 --> 22:56.049
So Rivera's group has
moved into Puerto Rico

22:56.174 --> 22:57.917
to try to grab the heroin trade.

22:58.042 --> 22:59.911
Drugs come in to the states
through smuggling corridors

23:00.036 --> 23:02.722
in Arizona, Texas,
and California.

23:02.847 --> 23:03.982
They're shipped to New Mexico

23:04.107 --> 23:05.750
then trucked to the
eastern seaboard.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.820
At the FBI, we have a saying
that applies to Puerto Rico.

23:08.945 --> 23:11.798
No customs, no problem.

23:11.923 --> 23:13.358
See that's what it's about.

23:13.483 --> 23:19.906
I mean they have a situation now where
it's kind of very distinct, you know.

23:20.031 --> 23:23.868
'Cause US territory means that any
shipments departing the United States

23:23.993 --> 23:26.546
are not
required to clear customs.

23:26.671 --> 23:28.815
So shipping the drugs
to the eastern seaboard

23:28.940 --> 23:30.175
from Puerto Rico
is easier than using

23:30.300 --> 23:32.477
the established
smuggling cartel routes

23:32.602 --> 23:35.121
and trucking the
stuff across country.

23:35.246 --> 23:37.590
And now that Rivera's
controlling it,

23:37.715 --> 23:39.684
he's trying to set
up a new situation.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.820
He's trying to set
up a new supply.

23:41.945 --> 23:45.565
And I think that's what
this meeting's about.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.158
The company's well
aware of the ambitions

23:47.283 --> 23:48.793
of Rivera and others like him.

23:48.918 --> 23:52.730
But until it leaves our borders
it's DEA and FBI territory.

23:52.855 --> 23:57.777
Intel has really shown us
unequivocally and absolutely

23:57.902 --> 24:00.004
that Rivera is joining forces

24:00.129 --> 24:03.649
with the
Islamic fundamentalists.

24:03.774 --> 24:07.178
And there's where
he'll get new supply,

24:07.303 --> 24:09.489
new man power, new routes.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.016
Al-Mujahid is gonna get
them all their quarters

24:12.141 --> 24:15.561
which gives them new access...

24:15.686 --> 24:17.789
...to bring anybody and anything

24:17.914 --> 24:22.461
they want into the US,
and that's scary.

24:29.867 --> 24:31.010
Istanbul.

24:31.135 --> 24:32.770
If it's good
enough for the heroin trade,

24:32.895 --> 24:35.415
it's good enough for Rivera.

24:35.540 --> 24:38.484
We all know that
devout believers,

24:38.609 --> 24:40.686
real believers of all faiths,

24:40.811 --> 24:44.082
have nothing to do with the rise
in violence across the world,

24:44.207 --> 24:47.927
but that doesn't mean that we
shouldn't do anything to stop it.

24:48.052 --> 24:50.255
In my book, it makes it
our duty to stop it.

24:50.380 --> 24:54.092
That's right. We don't give a fuck
about anybody's fucking religion.

24:54.217 --> 24:58.296
We don't care about what their
ethnicity is, we don't care.

24:58.421 --> 25:00.673
We let everybody
do what they want.

25:00.798 --> 25:02.934
It's like the great
Genghis Khan once said,

25:03.059 --> 25:06.112
"Practice your own religion,
but pay tax to me."

25:06.237 --> 25:09.908
It's like a monkey trying
to fuck a football now, really.

25:10.033 --> 25:12.644
This whole thing,
it's just a fucking mess.

25:15.746 --> 25:19.617
Anyway, my intel is
telling me right now that

25:19.742 --> 25:22.829
Rivera's supposedly
holding a summit.

25:22.954 --> 25:26.766
Supposed to be a big meeting
within the next 48 hours.

25:26.891 --> 25:31.037
It's my job to stop
that meeting from happening.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.197
First, we need a car.

25:33.322 --> 25:34.922
Let's see.

25:35.933 --> 25:37.902
Looks like I found
the perfect one.

25:38.027 --> 25:40.680
<i>Rivera collects
vintage American cars.</i>

25:40.805 --> 25:43.749
<i>How's a canary yellow</i>
<i>Camaro sound to you?</i>

25:43.874 --> 25:46.811
It's a little small
but it'll stand out.

27:00.951 --> 27:03.788
Sharp, you in position?

27:13.230 --> 27:14.830
In position.

27:26.777 --> 27:28.913
Rivera's pulling up now.

28:52.163 --> 28:54.432
Is our other party close?

29:04.241 --> 29:05.841
Not yet.

29:07.411 --> 29:11.049
Good, I'm getting into position,
Zara's heading inside now.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.874
Zara, you copy?

29:28.999 --> 29:30.810
Go, Harmon.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.837
<i>What's your 20?</i>

29:47.518 --> 29:49.895
At the elevators,
eighth floor.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.997
Stay put I'm coming
in the side door.

29:52.122 --> 29:55.193
Sharp, I need you to look into
target room on the eighth floor.

29:55.318 --> 29:56.918
I'm on it.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.016
Come on, where are you?

30:45.643 --> 30:47.243
<i>Sharp?</i>

30:48.445 --> 30:50.148
Still looking.

31:11.568 --> 31:13.168
Who the fuck are you?

31:27.451 --> 31:29.387
Sharp, you're killing me.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.324
Gotcha.

31:58.449 --> 32:01.119
Harmon, room 826.

32:03.387 --> 32:06.257
Zara, get me clearance
on the other side.

32:08.625 --> 32:10.227
Good afternoon, ma'am.
How can I help?

32:10.352 --> 32:12.605
Could you connect me
to room 825?

32:12.730 --> 32:15.666
Of course, ma'am. May I have
the name of your guest please?

32:15.791 --> 32:17.601
- O'Sullivan.
- O'Sullivan.

32:17.726 --> 32:22.147
- 825.
- 825, 825...

32:22.272 --> 32:24.175
I'm very sorry ma'am
but this room is vacant.

32:24.300 --> 32:27.311
Can I have the name
of your party again?

32:27.436 --> 32:29.054
O'Sullivan.

32:29.179 --> 32:31.215
Let me just check and make
sure I have the right room.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.626
It will help,
thank you very much.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.386
825.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.289
<i>Vacant, it's all yours, Harmon.</i>

32:38.414 --> 32:40.458
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Sharp are we covered?</i>

32:40.583 --> 32:42.460
Like white on rice.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.732
825.

33:17.327 --> 33:21.265
<i>I got my eyes on you, Harmon.</i>
<i>All good.</i>

34:01.738 --> 34:03.274
No answer, I'll have
to check back in a few.

34:03.399 --> 34:05.610
- Sorry for the bother.
- No problem.

34:08.277 --> 34:09.588
No, no.

34:09.713 --> 34:13.784
My friend... just you and me.

34:15.152 --> 34:18.063
You should go. It's enough.

34:18.188 --> 34:19.431
I'll go with you.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.458
You two watch the lobby
and you two make sure

34:21.583 --> 34:25.396
that Mr. Rauf makes it back to the
Palace Hotel without incident, okay.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.163
Let's go.

34:32.136 --> 34:36.148
Harmon, you got company.
Sending you an image now.

34:36.273 --> 34:37.873
Alright, stand by.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.779
<i>They are on their way up now.</i>

34:47.583 --> 34:50.755
<i>It's enough.</i>
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

34:57.227 --> 35:00.297
Ayan Al-Mujahid.
Former number two man, Hezbollah,

35:00.422 --> 35:02.399
in charge of the bomb makers.

35:02.524 --> 35:05.169
Fully assumed control back
in September

35:05.294 --> 35:08.773
after the US drone strike
took out his brother.

35:10.841 --> 35:14.278
His whereabouts is,
at the moment, unknown.

35:19.349 --> 35:22.420
<i>Looks like we just found him.</i>
<i>Gate four.</i>

35:42.639 --> 35:45.317
At last, no more middlemen.

35:45.442 --> 35:49.321
I trust the plane
was satisfactory, right?

35:49.446 --> 35:50.881
I see you already
met my assistants.

35:51.006 --> 35:53.392
Belicio, Augustine.

35:53.517 --> 35:54.852
Why are they here?

35:54.977 --> 35:57.329
I told you,
they are my assistants.

35:57.454 --> 35:58.689
<i>They are nothing but killers.</i>

35:58.814 --> 36:04.169
<i>Yes, and they happen to be
very good at what they do.</i>

36:04.294 --> 36:05.894
<i>Do you have problem with that?</i>

36:14.538 --> 36:18.476
Sure, no problem, hefe.

36:34.958 --> 36:37.328
What the fuck is that?

36:42.966 --> 36:44.802
What is what?

36:48.538 --> 36:50.374
Is that a camera?

36:51.942 --> 36:55.454
Ayan, we aren't in the desert.

36:55.579 --> 37:00.425
<i>This is a five star hotel</i>
<i>on some of the most expensive</i>

37:00.550 --> 37:02.520
<i>stretch of land in Istanbul.</i>

37:03.687 --> 37:06.524
Something is not right here.

37:09.493 --> 37:11.093
Ayan.

37:12.462 --> 37:14.062
Ayan.

37:15.799 --> 37:18.802
You don't think that I,
that I'm surveilling you

37:18.927 --> 37:21.213
without your knowledge here?

37:21.338 --> 37:25.809
I think you're acting maybe
a little paranoid, my friend.

37:25.934 --> 37:30.581
Rivera, it's not paranoia
if they are really after you.

37:31.581 --> 37:33.484
And I'm not your friend.

37:33.609 --> 37:38.230
I am, however, used to
things not going to plan.

37:38.355 --> 37:39.957
People dying because
of what I believe

37:40.082 --> 37:42.501
needs to be done for my cause.

37:42.626 --> 37:45.204
The merging of your
organization and ours

37:45.329 --> 37:47.965
is beneficial to both
of us in many ways.

37:48.090 --> 37:51.702
However, just because I need
your help, it doesn't mean

37:51.827 --> 37:55.606
I don't think of you as
nothing more than an infidel

37:55.731 --> 37:59.610
that I'd rather see dead
and buried in the sand.

38:03.380 --> 38:06.517
This should cover
the plane you sent.

38:08.785 --> 38:11.789
I'm heading back to the Palace Hotel
to check on the package.

38:11.914 --> 38:15.059
The meeting will take place
as previously discussed.

38:15.184 --> 38:18.570
At your compound
by the Rumeli Feneri.

38:18.695 --> 38:22.666
If any other suspicious
events will occur between

38:22.791 --> 38:27.946
now and then,
I can assure you of two things.

38:28.071 --> 38:31.883
One, the meeting
will not take place.

38:32.008 --> 38:36.513
And two, the last face
that you'll see before

38:36.638 --> 38:41.752
you are buried in the sand
will be mine, smiling.

38:46.723 --> 38:48.926
Mujahid is now on
his way to the lobby.

38:49.051 --> 38:52.537
They bought it.
Nice flying, Sharp.

38:52.662 --> 38:55.633
Time to get
the fuck out of here.

38:59.636 --> 39:01.638
Just go down to the lobby
and make sure

39:01.763 --> 39:04.675
nothing suspicious
happens while you do.

39:06.943 --> 39:12.650
Get someone out and ask who's
flying that fucking drone.

39:14.818 --> 39:19.698
Zara, give me
coordinates on my secure site

39:19.823 --> 39:23.435
and an accurate schematic,
if you can.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.096
Soon as you log the
time for the meeting.

39:26.221 --> 39:28.040
<i>Copy that.</i>

39:28.165 --> 39:30.542
<i>Sharp, I'm gonna
beat Al-Mujahid.</i>

39:30.667 --> 39:32.069
<i>Meet me back at the safe house.</i>

39:32.194 --> 39:33.794
Copy that.

39:45.715 --> 39:48.452
What's Rivera's
Camaro doing here?

39:55.659 --> 39:57.259
The drone.

39:59.629 --> 40:01.229
There, come on.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.544
Shit.

40:05.669 --> 40:07.605
Harmon, I've been made.

40:11.975 --> 40:14.586
I got two players
at the elevators.

40:14.711 --> 40:17.489
There's a third
in the elevator with him.

40:17.614 --> 40:19.784
Good to know
they're out numbered.

40:32.162 --> 40:34.565
<i>He's heading to his car.</i>

40:34.690 --> 40:36.641
Yeah, I know.

40:36.766 --> 40:38.636
It's his car, alright.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.940
- I'm calling Rivera.
- Yeah, okay.

40:46.843 --> 40:48.979
Did you take this car?

41:29.185 --> 41:32.756
Looks like time for phase two.

43:05.915 --> 43:08.352
Harmon, Rivera's on the move.

43:10.186 --> 43:11.663
<i>Follow him.</i>

43:11.788 --> 43:14.992
<i>But if he suspects you,
back off and then go.</i>

43:15.117 --> 43:18.329
We're just setting a hook,
not scaring him.

43:21.231 --> 43:22.641
Copy that.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.668
I'll keep peaking him
'til you do.

43:24.793 --> 43:26.393
Then I'll get gone.

43:32.909 --> 43:34.509
One hundred Euro.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.758
There's one just like it
if you follow that black car.

43:39.883 --> 43:42.219
And a third if you forget
you ever picked me up.

43:42.344 --> 43:44.421
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:44.546 --> 43:48.392
- I'm on my lunch break, so...
- That's what I like to hear.

44:00.870 --> 44:04.808
Tell me, have any
of you noticed the tail?

44:06.009 --> 44:07.609
Since the hotel.

44:09.379 --> 44:11.849
Lose him, lose him now.

44:15.285 --> 44:16.885
Game on.

44:28.898 --> 44:30.233
<i>They finally picked me up.</i>

44:30.358 --> 44:32.035
<i>How are you doing with Rivera?</i>

44:32.160 --> 44:34.738
He hasn't spotted me yet.
We're heading east.

44:34.863 --> 44:36.873
I'm thinking Zariyash district.

44:36.998 --> 44:38.016
<i>That's a good bet.</i>

44:38.141 --> 44:39.651
I'm gonna turn up
the heat a little bit.

44:39.776 --> 44:42.012
You back off and meet me at
the safe house in 30 minutes.

44:42.137 --> 44:43.246
Copy that, out.

44:43.371 --> 44:46.057
Okay, lunch break's over.

44:46.182 --> 44:49.260
New destination,
Zariyash district.

44:49.385 --> 44:52.022
I'll tell you where to go
when we get closer.

44:52.147 --> 44:54.858
Sure like doing
business with you, ma'am.

44:59.062 --> 45:02.799
- The tail is turning around.
- In the cab?

45:02.924 --> 45:04.809
Si.

45:04.934 --> 45:06.837
Must be the Arabs.

45:09.072 --> 45:15.320
I'm not sure what kind of game
Ayan is trying to play with me.

45:15.445 --> 45:18.348
Put the Turkish team
from the hotel on the cab.

45:18.473 --> 45:21.084
And no more fuck ups this time.
Understand?

45:21.209 --> 45:22.986
- Claro.
- Good.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.829
<i>Analyzing voice patterns.</i>

45:32.954 --> 45:36.032
<i>It's not paranoia
if they are really after you.</i>

45:36.157 --> 45:39.803
<i>Synthesizing voice for Al-Mujahid.</i>

45:42.906 --> 45:44.215
- Ayan.
-<i>Rivera.</i>

45:44.340 --> 45:47.419
I warned you about doing
anything suspicious, didn't I?

45:47.544 --> 45:49.279
<i>Ayan, I don't have</i>
<i>the slightest idea</i>

45:49.404 --> 45:50.547
what you're talking about

45:50.672 --> 45:53.951
and why you call me
on an unsecure line.

45:55.451 --> 45:58.221
- Do you own a yellow Camaro?
- You know I do.

45:58.346 --> 46:02.400
Please tell me why it's
following me at this moment.

46:02.525 --> 46:03.426
Who has my car?

46:03.551 --> 46:05.136
- What?
- Who has my car?

46:05.261 --> 46:06.897
It's at the compound. Why?

46:07.022 --> 46:10.534
Because this guy
is telling me in this moment

46:10.659 --> 46:13.069
that my car is following him.

46:13.194 --> 46:14.794
It's impossible.

46:26.616 --> 46:31.863
Ayan, I have no idea who
is following you in my car.

46:31.988 --> 46:34.165
<i>I warned you</i>
<i>that anymore bullshit</i>

46:34.290 --> 46:35.959
and I call off the meeting.

46:36.084 --> 46:37.795
Are you telling me?

46:39.028 --> 46:40.628
Yeah, I swear.

47:14.230 --> 47:14.839
Harmon, go.

47:14.964 --> 47:16.466
<i>The safe house, boss.</i>

47:16.591 --> 47:20.036
Good, Zara's right behind you.
I'll be there in 10.

47:20.161 --> 47:21.938
<i>They take the bait?</i>

47:22.063 --> 47:23.663
What do you think?

48:13.723 --> 48:16.192
<i>Harmon, speak to me.</i>

48:16.317 --> 48:19.930
We're gonna need
to get rid of the car.

48:43.019 --> 48:44.195
Harmon, go.

48:44.320 --> 48:45.263
<i>It's Beck.</i>

48:45.388 --> 48:48.158
Of all the people for
Rivera to be partnering with,

48:48.283 --> 48:52.470
Ayan Al-Mujahid is one of
the most dangerous, Beck.

48:52.595 --> 48:54.297
<i>That's why</i>
<i>he's CIA territory.</i>

48:54.422 --> 48:56.174
<i>That's all I can say.</i>

48:56.299 --> 48:57.576
And you would know?

48:57.701 --> 49:00.437
<i>Yes, even though I'm</i>
<i>not CIA I think I would know.</i>

49:00.562 --> 49:04.374
But there's another objective
because there usually is.

49:04.499 --> 49:07.243
<i>As I already told you,</i>
<i>I'm not CIA,</i>

49:07.368 --> 49:08.712
<i>so I wouldn't know.</i>

49:08.837 --> 49:12.115
And as I am also not
working for the Agency,

49:12.240 --> 49:17.087
I'm just a reactivated asset,
maybe you could tell me why.

49:17.212 --> 49:18.329
<i>Why?</i>

49:18.454 --> 49:21.099
Because we would be searching
all over Mexico

49:21.224 --> 49:24.327
to find this location if it
wasn't for you and your team.

49:24.452 --> 49:27.038
So why did you reactivate me?

49:27.163 --> 49:29.974
Because you
killed the bear, John.

49:30.099 --> 49:31.634
<i>And now I need you</i>
<i>to kill someone else.</i>

49:31.759 --> 49:36.180
Al-Mujahid and Jose Rivera
are gonna seal this fucking deal

49:36.305 --> 49:39.617
tomorrow night unless I act
on this intel right away.

49:39.742 --> 49:41.586
<i>What do you
have to say about that?</i>

49:41.711 --> 49:43.079
I've got a delta team en route

49:43.204 --> 49:44.989
to handle that
very problem for you.

49:45.114 --> 49:47.751
<i>Like you said, Hawk,
we don't need you or your team</i>

49:47.876 --> 49:50.929
<i>to end up being the villain</i>
<i>if this thing goes south.</i>

49:51.054 --> 49:54.057
You did what you needed to do,
pinpoint and locate the meeting.

49:54.182 --> 49:58.461
<i>Now it's time to do</i>
<i>what you do best, alone.</i>

49:58.586 --> 50:02.674
You know if I
remember correctly, Beck,

50:02.799 --> 50:05.109
you came to me hat in hand.

50:05.234 --> 50:07.137
You begged me to help.

50:07.262 --> 50:10.114
Look, I'm here,
off the books,

50:10.239 --> 50:12.776
because I need to
reactivate a cold asset.

50:12.901 --> 50:17.121
I had my reservations,
but I agreed.

50:17.246 --> 50:21.351
All I asked was at the time
you be straight with me.

50:21.476 --> 50:25.196
And somehow,
in the back of my mind,

50:25.321 --> 50:28.324
I'm getting this strange
little voice telling me,

50:28.449 --> 50:30.794
they're not being
straight with you.

50:30.919 --> 50:33.438
And I don't think you are.

50:33.563 --> 50:36.166
<i>And I was, John.
Just think about it.</i>

50:36.291 --> 50:38.476
The money,
the resources, the team.

50:38.601 --> 50:41.179
Now I'm tasking you
with another objective.

50:41.304 --> 50:42.305
<i>Comes from the top.</i>

50:42.430 --> 50:44.649
<i>You're the CIA's</i>
<i>best wet mechanic,</i>

50:44.774 --> 50:46.376
<i>and you're already in country.</i>

50:46.501 --> 50:48.344
That was no accident, okay.

50:48.469 --> 50:50.447
Who is the target?

50:50.572 --> 50:54.217
Is the real target Al-Mujahid?

50:54.342 --> 50:54.993
<i>No.</i>

50:55.118 --> 50:56.753
<i>Is the target in that room?</i>

50:56.878 --> 50:58.488
Yes.

51:00.289 --> 51:02.859
Do you want
my team to stand down?

51:02.984 --> 51:04.584
<i>Yes.</i>

51:07.463 --> 51:11.134
- So you want me to act alone.
<i>- Yes.</i>

51:12.335 --> 51:16.481
- Who is the target?
- Abdul Rauf.

51:16.606 --> 51:18.016
<i>You know the name, John.</i>

51:18.141 --> 51:19.484
<i>The third
Crimea Airlines bomber.</i>

51:19.609 --> 51:21.644
<i>The one who actually made the</i>
<i>bomb that took down the plane</i>

51:21.769 --> 51:25.415
<i>with 238 innocent</i>
<i>people on board.</i>

52:01.417 --> 52:04.420
<i>Welcome to Crimea flight A-450.</i>

52:04.545 --> 52:08.324
<i>Please step out of the aisle
while stowing the carry on baggage</i>

52:08.449 --> 52:11.261
<i>allowing other</i>
<i>passengers to pass.</i>

53:01.444 --> 53:03.980
<i>He's a bad one, John.</i>

53:04.105 --> 53:06.190
<i>CIA trained.</i>

53:06.315 --> 53:07.917
<i>He's about to activate
cells in the US.</i>

53:08.042 --> 53:09.494
<i>He's the package.</i>

53:09.619 --> 53:11.387
The one being
smuggled in by Rivera.

53:11.512 --> 53:13.590
<i>This alliance</i>
<i>is all so Al-Mujahid</i>

53:13.715 --> 53:15.299
<i>can get Rauf into the US.</i>

53:15.424 --> 53:17.335
<i>So have your team</i>
<i>pack up their gear.</i>

53:17.460 --> 53:18.895
<i>I'll set up</i>
<i>an exit route for you</i>

53:19.020 --> 53:21.372
<i>on USS Mount Whitney</i>
<i>in three hours.</i>

53:21.497 --> 53:22.498
Their mission is over.

53:22.623 --> 53:24.434
<i>Get it done John and come home.</i>

53:24.559 --> 53:25.477
So that's it?

53:25.602 --> 53:27.670
Well, as far as he's concerned,
for you two, that's it.

53:27.795 --> 53:30.781
As far as I'm concerned,
it's not it.

53:30.906 --> 53:33.376
You don't think I had anything
to do with this, do you?

53:33.501 --> 53:34.444
I don't know, man.

53:34.569 --> 53:38.289
I think that if you're
asking me if you had anything

53:38.414 --> 53:40.917
to do with Beck
pulling us from the job

53:41.042 --> 53:44.254
one minute after he
received enough information

53:44.379 --> 53:48.625
to pass it on up the food chain,
I would say no.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.403
Okay, thanks.

54:07.310 --> 54:10.714
That was my office,
there's nothing I can do.

54:17.887 --> 54:20.857
Beck really thinks it's
a good idea to pull us out

54:20.982 --> 54:22.458
before we finish the job?

54:22.583 --> 54:26.029
He does have
other operational plans.

54:28.431 --> 54:29.766
You're staying on.

54:29.891 --> 54:31.491
I am.

54:32.535 --> 54:33.736
You have a new objective.

54:33.861 --> 54:36.506
I'm not gonna listen
to any of his shit.

54:36.631 --> 54:39.517
I'll make him think I am,
but I'm not.

54:39.642 --> 54:42.520
We're gonna stay on
and we will kick ass together.

54:42.645 --> 54:44.747
Nothing's gonna change,
we'll finish what we started.

54:44.872 --> 54:46.749
- You hear?
- And how do we do that?

54:46.874 --> 54:50.453
Like this.
You're gonna love this.

54:55.091 --> 54:57.401
What are you guys cooking up?

54:57.526 --> 55:00.697
See, we already have
all the leg work done.

55:00.822 --> 55:04.100
We've got the location,
the time of the meet,

55:04.225 --> 55:05.509
and the players.

55:05.634 --> 55:08.638
And that's really
all Beck cares about.

55:08.763 --> 55:12.350
What we also did was
create a situation where

55:12.475 --> 55:14.811
we've pitted these guys
against each other.

55:14.936 --> 55:18.522
They suspect each other,
that's gonna fuck up the meeting,

55:18.647 --> 55:21.351
and pretty soon they're
gonna wanna kill each other.

55:21.476 --> 55:22.326
Cy ops.

55:22.451 --> 55:23.753
Well, that's kinda how we do.

55:23.878 --> 55:25.521
<i>Anyway, we've just succeeded</i>

55:25.646 --> 55:27.857
<i>in burning these bitches</i>
<i>to the ground,</i>

55:27.982 --> 55:30.927
<i>'cause Rivera can't figure out
why his Arab partners</i>

55:31.052 --> 55:35.898
<i>decided to wage a secret war
against him at this critical junction.</i>

55:36.023 --> 55:39.936
<i>He doesn't know
that they haven't, and we have.</i>

55:45.808 --> 55:48.019
So you're altering
his official file.

55:48.144 --> 55:50.113
Beck's gonna know
that's been dummied up.

55:50.238 --> 55:52.048
It's not for Beck.

55:53.549 --> 55:56.594
<i>This is for Rivera.</i>

55:56.719 --> 56:00.657
<i>So you're setting up</i>
<i>Al-Mujahid with Rivera.</i>

56:03.025 --> 56:04.769
What about the other way around?

56:04.894 --> 56:07.430
<i>Al-Mujahid's the
mastermind behind all of this.</i>

56:07.555 --> 56:10.074
<i>Without his desire for</i>
<i>this meeting to take place,</i>

56:10.199 --> 56:12.635
<i>Rivera would be content
running the drug trade.</i>

56:12.760 --> 56:16.580
There's no doubt that Al-Mujahid knows
the value of this access into the US.

56:16.705 --> 56:18.741
So much so that he's
willing to put up with all

56:18.866 --> 56:21.352
the perceived indignities
to make it happen.

56:21.477 --> 56:24.147
And his threat to pull out
is just that, threats.

56:24.272 --> 56:27.358
Because he has resident
cells placed inside the US,

56:27.483 --> 56:29.452
what does he need
to activate them?

56:29.577 --> 56:31.754
Transient cells,
someone smuggled in.

56:31.879 --> 56:36.593
He'd give anything for that.
And for that, he needs Rivera.

56:38.661 --> 56:41.038
Rivera's compound.

56:41.163 --> 56:45.009
Anyway, the location of the
meeting's in 24 hours, guys.

56:45.134 --> 56:47.837
This is the alarm system
command and control.

56:52.775 --> 56:56.746
Rivera 1-4-6-9-2-5 override.

56:58.881 --> 57:04.562
<i>Rivera 1-4-6-9-2-5 override.</i>

57:04.687 --> 57:06.097
What'd you just do?

57:06.222 --> 57:08.157
Shut off the alarm system.

57:08.282 --> 57:10.593
How does that affect Al-Mujahid?

57:31.680 --> 57:34.751
Who turned off the alarm,
and why?

57:57.806 --> 58:01.652
Ayan. It's become
all too regular for you

58:01.777 --> 58:03.212
to be calling me like this.

58:03.337 --> 58:05.781
What the fuck
are you talking about?

58:05.906 --> 58:11.095
Do you know that you threatened
to march, you piece of shit.

58:11.220 --> 58:13.789
Or maybe I just
call your bluff, hmm.

58:13.914 --> 58:17.435
I'm a businessman,
I do business.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.929
You said that you want
to call off the meeting.

58:20.054 --> 58:23.641
<i>Fine, call the meeting, fine.</i>

58:23.766 --> 58:26.302
<i>But my humor has a limit.</i>

58:26.427 --> 58:30.514
<i>And then I become</i>
<i>a real asshole.</i>

58:30.639 --> 58:33.175
And when I'm a real asshole,

58:33.300 --> 58:37.847
I sometimes forget about
my business agreements.

58:37.972 --> 58:39.657
Understand me?

58:39.782 --> 58:42.718
<i>You mean to tell me
that you have had nothing to do</i>

58:42.843 --> 58:44.253
<i>with the drone surveillance?</i>

58:44.378 --> 58:46.756
What the fuck is that?

58:52.828 --> 58:56.240
- What is what?
- Is that a camera?

58:56.365 --> 59:00.103
The attempt on my life
in your flashy yellow car?

59:02.705 --> 59:05.908
And now the very suspicious
disarming of your alarm system

59:06.033 --> 59:09.812
right before our meeting
at your compound.

59:13.015 --> 59:18.621
Do not think for one moment
that I don't know my value for the CIA.

59:20.155 --> 59:24.093
You forget my only reason
for making this agreement.

59:24.218 --> 59:25.818
Rauf.

59:26.929 --> 59:29.765
Must be that all your
good humor is used up.

59:29.890 --> 59:31.842
<i>Is that it?</i>

59:31.967 --> 59:33.803
<i>So being the businessman</i>
<i>that you are,</i>

59:33.928 --> 59:35.838
do not think that
I'm foolish enough

59:35.963 --> 59:39.342
not to see a double cross
when one present itself.

59:40.876 --> 59:44.847
You are more paranoid
than Pablo Escobar ever was.

59:44.972 --> 59:50.787
<i>I suggest you rethink your</i>
<i>priorities and call me back.</i>

59:51.887 --> 59:56.600
I will give you 30 minutes.

59:56.725 --> 01:00:02.239
Ayan, please believe
this 30 minutes

01:00:02.364 --> 01:00:09.872
are the most important 30 minutes
of your entire existence.

01:00:26.955 --> 01:00:29.600
You know,
this could get back to us.

01:00:29.725 --> 01:00:31.335
In my opinion if this works,

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.271
they're gonna pat us on the
back and take all the credit.

01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:35.865
If it doesn't, they'll swoop in

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:37.733
with the D-boys
and kill everybody.

01:00:37.858 --> 01:00:41.078
Either way we will have
finished the job we started.

01:00:41.203 --> 01:00:42.713
I'm gonna pack up my gear,

01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:45.875
and I'll meet you at the
extraction point in two hours.

01:01:26.915 --> 01:01:30.094
It's been awhile since
I've seen you like that.

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.721
I mean, you're the one
looking like that.

01:01:31.846 --> 01:01:34.357
It's been awhile since
I've seen you like that.

01:03:02.544 --> 01:03:04.981
I thought I closed those.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.654
John?

01:03:44.519 --> 01:03:46.856
Get the other one.

01:05:17.245 --> 01:05:19.489
How long?

01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:23.085
- Forty-five minutes.
- Rivera or Al-Mujahid?

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:26.330
- Rivera.
- So she's in the compound.

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:27.431
What's the play?

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.591
I'm going to get
my partner back.

01:05:29.716 --> 01:05:31.316
I'll get the van.

01:06:01.189 --> 01:06:04.293
Sure like doing
business with you, ma'am.

01:06:11.666 --> 01:06:13.266
She's awake.

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.843
No, she's not.

01:06:27.682 --> 01:06:29.451
Zara's cell phone.

01:06:29.576 --> 01:06:32.162
What? You sure?

01:06:32.287 --> 01:06:36.258
<i>...Rauf makes it back to the
Palace Hotel without incident, okay.</i>

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:01.684
Come on, get in,
I'll fill you in on the drive.

01:07:20.268 --> 01:07:24.214
- I missed it.
- Missed what?

01:07:24.339 --> 01:07:27.217
It was right under my
nose and I missed it.

01:07:27.342 --> 01:07:28.444
I'm not following you.

01:07:28.569 --> 01:07:30.420
This entire
meeting was a set up.

01:07:30.545 --> 01:07:33.615
And it was a set up to get us
looking in the wrong direction.

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.319
Beck tasked us with putting
together a team to locate

01:07:37.444 --> 01:07:42.399
and disrupt a meeting between
Daish and the cartels.

01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:45.327
But mysteriously they
won't let us finish it.

01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:47.052
Why?

01:07:48.363 --> 01:07:50.800
Because he's a paid
and bought bureaucrat?

01:07:52.434 --> 01:07:55.304
Because he thought
the real target would be there.

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.375
Take a look at this.

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:01.385
<i>You two watch the lobby.</i>

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:03.479
<i>And you make sure that
Mr. Rauf makes it back</i>

01:08:03.604 --> 01:08:06.749
<i>to the Palace Hotel
without incident, okay.</i>

01:08:11.486 --> 01:08:14.456
- I know that name.
- Yeah, we all do.

01:08:14.581 --> 01:08:18.201
<i>Abdul Rauf was
trained by the Agency.</i>

01:08:18.326 --> 01:08:20.729
<i>But that was before he
and his buddies blew up</i>

01:08:20.854 --> 01:08:24.733
the commercial airliner
that killed about 238 people.

01:08:24.858 --> 01:08:28.703
In Mujahid's file he was
in charge of the bomb makers

01:08:28.828 --> 01:08:32.082
before his brother
was killed and he took over

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:34.283
the command and control, so...

01:08:34.408 --> 01:08:36.310
If he's carrying a
suitcase nuke or a dirty bomb

01:08:36.435 --> 01:08:39.089
he could decimate
a US city in seconds.

01:08:39.214 --> 01:08:41.817
See, Beck wants me to take
him out before he gets there,

01:08:41.942 --> 01:08:44.227
but his intel is bad.

01:08:44.352 --> 01:08:47.555
He's sending in the D-boys
to the wrong location,

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.698
which means
we have no more time.

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:52.528
It means you and I are gonna
have to get there and do this.

01:08:52.653 --> 01:08:54.662
Alright.
So where are we headed?

01:08:54.787 --> 01:08:57.741
<i>I'll go with him.</i>
<i>You two watch the lobby.</i>

01:08:57.866 --> 01:08:59.768
<i>And you make sure that
Mr. Rauf makes it back</i>

01:08:59.893 --> 01:09:02.671
<i>to the Palace Hotel
without incident, okay.</i>

01:09:02.796 --> 01:09:04.640
Palace Hotel.

01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:49.225
Ayan, what the fuck?
Where is Rauf?

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.462
I was about you to ask
you the same thing Rivera.

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:55.191
Is this how you Mexicans
do all your deals?

01:10:08.036 --> 01:10:09.738
What the fuck is this?

01:10:09.863 --> 01:10:13.183
If my understanding
of English is any good,

01:10:13.308 --> 01:10:16.612
I will say that the man
pictured where your picture

01:10:16.737 --> 01:10:21.350
is supposed to be, doesn't
look a thing like Ayan Mujahid.

01:10:21.475 --> 01:10:23.760
And to add insult to injury,

01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:27.289
it says there
that you're supposed to be dead.

01:10:27.414 --> 01:10:31.501
So, again, where is Rauf?

01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:35.338
- I see what is going on here.
- You see?

01:10:35.463 --> 01:10:39.868
Please, enlighten me because
what I thought is gonna be on

01:10:39.993 --> 01:10:43.446
was a meeting
to seal our alliances.

01:10:43.571 --> 01:10:47.443
- To create few rules.
- We have a saying.

01:10:48.476 --> 01:10:49.519
Please.

01:10:49.644 --> 01:10:52.556
The man who speaks,
does not plan.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:55.592
The man who plans,
does not speak.

01:10:55.717 --> 01:10:58.754
It means I don't think
you are behind this.

01:10:58.879 --> 01:11:00.964
It looks like CIA to me.

01:11:01.089 --> 01:11:04.526
And this is supposed
to make me feel better. How?

01:11:04.651 --> 01:11:09.531
You aren't smart enough
to be working for the CIA.

01:11:11.599 --> 01:11:15.512
For the last time,
where is Rauf?

01:11:15.637 --> 01:11:19.642
We have been compromised,
our business is finished.

01:11:20.675 --> 01:11:22.275
Ayan.

01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:31.487
I want to show you something.

01:11:34.522 --> 01:11:37.426
We're here to smuggle Mr. Rauf
into the United States, no?

01:11:37.551 --> 01:11:39.595
So time to make the deal.

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.609
Is this a joke?

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:49.571
You're right, there seems to be
a third party in our midst.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:25.507
Harmon, eyes are up.
What's your 20?

01:12:29.944 --> 01:12:32.114
Entering now.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:57.580
<i>We're moving out
now. Begin sweeping the grounds</i>

01:12:57.705 --> 01:12:59.141
<i>and meet us
in the conference room.</i>

01:12:59.266 --> 01:13:00.866
Copy that.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.683
Who the fuck are you?

01:13:54.028 --> 01:13:57.466
<i>Gotcha.</i>
<i>Third floor. Wait.</i>

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.806
<i>They're moving Rauf out now.</i>

01:14:04.931 --> 01:14:08.644
<i>Land your bird
and get in here and back me up.</i>

01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:10.946
Going upstairs.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:12.748
Copy that.

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.834
Hey, wait.

01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:34.559
Who are you?

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:22.751
It looks like someone decided
to cancel our arrangement.

01:15:23.851 --> 01:15:26.763
What do you mean? Her?

01:15:26.888 --> 01:15:29.724
- She's just a fucking woman.
- Enough.

01:15:29.849 --> 01:15:34.229
Benicio, untie her and give
her something to drink.

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:39.167
We'll see if she's
more than just a woman.

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.811
Boss, come with me, now.

01:15:49.936 --> 01:15:51.780
Rivera!

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:11.833
<i>...moving in.</i>

01:16:16.337 --> 01:16:19.741
Come on, boss, we have
to get you out of here.

01:16:27.148 --> 01:16:28.858
- Let's go.
- I want Rauf.

01:16:28.983 --> 01:16:31.019
If I have Rauf,
I have all the leverage

01:16:31.144 --> 01:16:32.754
to get out of this mess.

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.140
Uh-uh, come on.

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:14.229
<i>Copy that.
Team two closing the perimeter.</i>

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:18.498
Come on.

01:18:00.775 --> 01:18:05.047
Compound is clear.
No sign of Rivera.

01:18:10.017 --> 01:18:11.961
Copy. You hear that, Harmon?

01:18:12.086 --> 01:18:16.024
D-boys are clearing the compound.
No sign of Rivera or Zara.

01:20:04.265 --> 01:20:08.010
Yeah, Sharp,
I've located the target.

01:20:08.135 --> 01:20:11.006
<i>Ground floor conference room,</i>
<i>near the back.</i>

01:20:15.009 --> 01:20:18.421
Two guards posted.
Two guards.

01:20:18.546 --> 01:20:20.114
<i>I've located</i>
<i>the main power box.</i>

01:20:20.239 --> 01:20:21.182
<i>On my count.</i>

01:20:21.307 --> 01:20:24.093
Three, two, one.

01:20:47.241 --> 01:20:51.012
<i>Rivera got through,</i>
<i>repeat Rivera on the run.</i>

01:20:53.948 --> 01:20:55.884
Mr. Rauf.

01:21:16.337 --> 01:21:19.007
Do you know why I'm here?

01:21:20.207 --> 01:21:21.676
Do you know why you're here?

01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:25.021
I'm here because
the CIA hates it

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:27.290
when they train somebody

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:31.928
who takes what they've given
them and makes a lot of money

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:35.198
to finance
terrorist activities.

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:36.658
Is that what they told you?

01:21:36.783 --> 01:21:40.169
Yeah, they told me that
and I read a few reports.

01:21:40.294 --> 01:21:43.331
But what if I told you that
I was ordered to do what I did?

01:21:43.456 --> 01:21:46.534
That I know all about
the CIA's deep dark secrets

01:21:46.659 --> 01:21:50.271
from Tripoli to Syria
and everything in between.

01:21:50.396 --> 01:21:51.981
You know too much.

01:21:52.106 --> 01:21:53.508
I'd say that's
why I'm a target.

01:21:53.633 --> 01:21:56.177
I commend you for
telling the truth.

01:21:56.302 --> 01:22:01.650
I just can't let you come into America
and activate these cells.

01:22:05.286 --> 01:22:09.624
You actually think that this is
a war of religious differences?

01:22:09.749 --> 01:22:13.261
It's much bigger than
differences in ideologies.

01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:18.140
I got it. I understand warriors
fighting for their cause,

01:22:18.265 --> 01:22:21.177
for their countries,
for their religion,

01:22:21.302 --> 01:22:23.705
whatever they believe in,
their ideology.

01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:28.610
But I draw the line when it comes to
killing innocent women and children.

01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:39.295
This is where we really, really

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.223
have a big
difference of opinion.

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.193
Okay.

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:05.613
Rivera got through,
he's got Zara.

01:23:05.738 --> 01:23:07.716
Then he's coming here.

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:27.802
You go that way.

01:23:27.927 --> 01:23:30.572
Come with me. Move.

01:26:08.495 --> 01:26:10.139
Fuck you, puta.

01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:31.653
Let's go home.

01:26:42.429 --> 01:26:44.499
We're done here, Sharp.

01:27:01.615 --> 01:27:05.761
<i>The paradigm has changed,</i>
<i>not shifted.</i>

01:27:05.886 --> 01:27:07.755
<i>What we do</i>
<i>is protect the people</i>

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.367
<i>of the United States</i>
<i>of America.</i>

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:14.603
<i>And the American people</i>
<i>and all the elected officials</i>

01:27:14.728 --> 01:27:16.931
<i>don't need to know</i>
<i>what we do, how we do it,</i>

01:27:17.056 --> 01:27:18.774
<i>or who we do it to.</i>

01:27:18.899 --> 01:27:22.837
<i>All they need to know is</i>
<i>when they go to bed at night</i>

01:27:22.962 --> 01:27:28.843
<i>and turn out the lights,</i>
<i>that they're safe.</i>

01:28:01.608 --> 01:28:03.944
<i>First we need a car.</i>
