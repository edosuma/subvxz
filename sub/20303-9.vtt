NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.503 --> 00:04.379
Do it, dog breath,

00:04.462 --> 00:06.506
and your brains will go across the street.

00:06.965 --> 00:10.051
Stop this criminal act,
or I shall be forced to use violence.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.094
Name?

00:11.720 --> 00:15.306
(fanfare) Captain Freedom.
(mimics explosion)

00:15.390 --> 00:19.561
When I walk, buildings shake
and bad guys wet their pants.

00:19.644 --> 00:21.980
Hey, is that a bleeding mole
on your forehead?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.148
(chuckles) What bleeding mole?

00:23.398 --> 00:25.900
You know, it's one of the seven
danger signs of cancer.

00:25.984 --> 00:30.447
Polysorbate 60, artificial colorings
and flavoring, and scorbic acid?

00:30.989 --> 00:32.907
You're a walking time bomb, Leo.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.995
That missing plaster up there could be
exposing you to asbestos poisoning.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.707
You know, the tiny particles,
they filter down and get into your lungs.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.293
I'm the one who's supposed to fight
the bad guys.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.462
It's what they pay me for.

00:45.837 --> 00:49.674
They do need me on Mars.
There's a serious crime problem there.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.427
I have to build a spaceship.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.013
Yeah, take your time. Do it right.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.058
Well, if you're in need of the services
of Captain Freedom,

00:58.516 --> 01:00.393
just hand a red flag from your rooftop.

01:01.102 --> 01:01.936
Or a blanket.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.564
NARRATOR:<i> And now, on </i>Hill Street Blues...

01:04.647 --> 01:07.692
I want this golf ball booked,
locked up, or I quit.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.236
Listen to me.
You gotta get ahold of yourself.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.865
This<i> Alice in Wonderland</i>
stuff is fun, but it's gotta stop.

01:13.948 --> 01:17.160
I'm running the cleanest department
in 40 years.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.205
The Hill's clean, Chief, if that's what
you called me up here to talk about.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.832
Are you implying I'm guilty
of a crime, Mr. Peck?

01:22.916 --> 01:26.044
I'm implying that you may have
perjured yourself today.

01:32.383 --> 01:36.596
(chattering)

01:36.679 --> 01:39.557
ESTERHAUS: Introducing the new
and improved A-16 arrest form.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.017
You've all been handed a copy.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.311
-MAN: Right here, Sarge.
-Uh--

01:43.978 --> 01:48.358
The important difference in this new form
involves the utilization of six--

01:48.608 --> 01:51.444
I repeat, six... carbons in tandem.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.531
Because of this, you are invited to apply

01:54.614 --> 01:57.033
copious amounts of "ligatoid"
and muscular pressure

01:57.117 --> 02:01.454
when using pen or pencil,
so as to cause each underlying sheet

02:01.538 --> 02:03.373
to render itself legible.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.668
-Got enough lead in your pencil, J.D.?
-Just had it sharpened.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.212
Item 12 is a memo from Gang Intervention

02:09.295 --> 02:12.841
concerning the upcoming expiration
of a number of treaties,

02:13.174 --> 02:16.302
specifically those between
the Blood, Mau-Maus,

02:16.386 --> 02:17.971
Shamrocks, Diablos.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.558
The, uh, thrust of said memo,
pending negotiations,

02:21.641 --> 02:22.600
let's not upset any apple carts.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.853
-You won't believe what happened.
-I don't want to hear it.

02:24.936 --> 02:28.022
Be sensitive to your various behavior
changes which may occur,

02:28.106 --> 02:31.109
-and expect a 30 percent increase...
-(arguing grows louder)

02:31.192 --> 02:32.986
youth violence-wise.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.696
-Listen to me for a second. I told you--
-I don't want to hear it.

02:34.779 --> 02:38.116
PHIL: Coffey, Bates,
a little decorum, please.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.201
(laughter)

02:41.452 --> 02:45.665
The subject of which brings me
to last night's nuptial celebration

02:45.748 --> 02:48.877
-of Mr. and Mrs. Rudy Pestolozzi...
-MAN: All right!

02:48.960 --> 02:52.797
attended by the officers of this precinct
at the Kubiak Lodge.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.888
In general,
I would be remiss if I failed to note

02:59.971 --> 03:04.559
with some dismay the alcoholic consumption
per capita of this precinct...

03:04.642 --> 03:06.269
(chattering)

03:06.352 --> 03:10.440
And in specific, the behavior of a certain
officer of the female persuasion,

03:10.523 --> 03:14.736
who, no doubt under the influence
of certain controlled substances,

03:14.819 --> 03:20.033
performed a remarkably lewd
and suggestive striptease dance...

03:20.116 --> 03:22.118
(chattering)

03:22.202 --> 03:23.620
PHIL: Much to the embarrassment

03:23.703 --> 03:25.997
-of the bride's mother and father.
-It was beautiful.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.081
(applause)

03:27.165 --> 03:28.541
HILL: We loved it though, Sarge.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.461
Be apprised, on duty or off,

03:31.544 --> 03:34.672
professional standards of conduct
must apply.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.382
(speaking French)

03:37.258 --> 03:38.092
<i>Bon.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:41.971
Boo. (laughs)

03:42.055 --> 03:43.806
As a personal aside, however,

03:43.890 --> 03:47.393
may I express a certain
grudging admiration

03:47.477 --> 03:52.023
for said female's
outstanding suppleness of limb...

03:52.106 --> 03:54.901
-MAN: Yeah.
-PHIL: As well as her youthfully firm

03:54.984 --> 03:56.194
other attributes.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.738
(chattering)

03:59.489 --> 04:03.117
(speaking French)

04:03.201 --> 04:05.578
-RENKO: What did he say?
-HILL: Say what?

04:06.079 --> 04:10.875
I said, "Let's roll,
and let's be careful out there."

04:12.585 --> 04:14.212
-COFFEY: Will you look at my eye?
-BATES: No.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.922
(chattering)

04:16.005 --> 04:18.758
-COFFEY: What's wrong with you?
-BATES: I don't want to look at your eye.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.427
COFFEY: Hey, just--
Hey, come back here for one second.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.387
BATES: Forget it.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.514
Would you at least let me explain, Lucy?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.933
Sunrise breakfast at The Breakers,
huh, big shot?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.309
Champagne at dawn?

04:28.643 --> 04:31.437
I waited for you until 6:30,
and I felt like a jerk.

04:31.688 --> 04:36.025
I would have met you, but I stopped home
to clean up after the wedding,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.112
and I fell coming out of the shower.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.825
Well, what do you think--
I did this to myself on purpose?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.286
You should have called anyway.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.163
Lucy, I was out cold on the floor.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.043
-Did you to see a doctor?
-Yeah. That's why I was late to roll call.

04:54.127 --> 04:54.961
Oh, Joe.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.964
-You could have really hurt yourself.
-I'm all right, though.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.799
You think you got problems?
We've really got problems.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.427
-What do you mean, we've got problems?
-We, W-E, as in "we, us."

05:02.510 --> 05:04.304
-You gotta take some responsibility.
-I wasn't even there!

05:04.387 --> 05:05.722
What are you talking about anyway?

05:05.805 --> 05:07.682
Just step into my office
for a minute here.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.020
Oh, no. I'm not goin' in there.
I'm not. No! Uh-uh.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.564
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:15.023 --> 05:16.607
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:16.691 --> 05:20.570
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:20.653 --> 05:22.280
(sirens wailing)

05:27.744 --> 05:31.664
(theme music playing)

06:35.978 --> 06:38.147
(toilet flushes)

06:41.275 --> 06:42.193
Let's go, Samson.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.780
Later, man.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.787
I lost my gun-- My departmental piece.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.790
-(snickers)
-He didn't lose it. Someone stole it.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.042
Last night, after "Pestolo--"
whatever his name is's wedding--

06:58.126 --> 06:59.877
we were playing cards
in the back of Kubiak's Lodge--

06:59.961 --> 07:02.547
Two guys dropped in
in ski masks, 12-gauge shotguns

07:02.630 --> 07:06.050
and boosted all the money
and his (snickering) gun.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.303
So what's the big deal?
You report it, and that's it.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.721
No, no. Luce, you don't understand.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.849
Kubiak would lose their liquor license,

07:12.932 --> 07:15.518
Mitch Flynn's wife would kill him
if she found out he was there--

07:16.060 --> 07:18.146
-Hold it for one there, please.
-MAN: What's goin' on in there?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.731
Not to mention what it'd do to my chances
of being in plain clothes.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.024
MAN: Come on, I gotta go.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.527
-Well, what do you want us to do?
-Come on, get out of there.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.028
I want my money!

07:27.196 --> 07:29.198
I want some satisfaction.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.953
(onlookers clamoring)

07:34.036 --> 07:35.705
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-Hey.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.999
-I want some justice.
-You'll get your money.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.041
My machine!

07:40.501 --> 07:42.462
What did they do to you? Oh, my God.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.839
-I'll take you out of here.
-Lou. Lou.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.382
No. Don't touch me. Get away from me.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.759
I'm taking my machine out of here.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.053
I'm not letting you maniacs
torture it anymore.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.306
Lou, calm down.
You don't even have a dolly.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.892
That's all right.
I'll carry it out on my back.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.270
Oh, Lou, people are naturally prone
toward snap decisions

07:59.353 --> 08:00.855
after witnessing a violent act.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.690
Hey, hey. Give yourself some time.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.318
(moaning)

08:07.778 --> 08:09.572
You've beaten my machines.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.826
You-- You call it names
I don't even hear out on the street.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.661
You've even shot it.

08:16.704 --> 08:17.705
That's it. It's over.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.874
Done. Finished!

08:20.875 --> 08:22.210
You want sweet rolls?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.504
You'll walk six blocks in the snow.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.215
Let's talk about that.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.132
-No.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.383
You never understood.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.677
These machines-- They're like my children.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.264
Police stations--
They said, "Put 'em in police stations."

08:35.431 --> 08:37.183
-"Think of the traffic."
-Sit down, Lou.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.561
We had a slight drama in the corridor.
I'll try for a happy ending.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.396
Lou.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.858
That machine-- it's a survivor.

08:46.275 --> 08:50.905
After all the abuse and punishment,
still it stands, bloody but unbowed.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.448
It's a symbol, Lou.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.784
You take it away, anything could happen.

08:55.451 --> 08:59.455
The line could falter, break.
The hordes come crashing in.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.960
You don't supply tasty diversions.

09:04.835 --> 09:08.172
You give us the reason to go on.

09:08.756 --> 09:12.343
Renko, if this is gonna be so easy,
what do you need the three of us for?

09:12.426 --> 09:17.890
Like I said, it's easy, but it requires
people who can work in depth.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.231
-JOE: Oh, man, I'm gonna get sick.
-BATES: Got a balloon.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.361
Oh, God!

09:31.779 --> 09:33.906
That's it, Renko. Enough is enough.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.243
Aw, come on, Joe.
My whole career is on the line here.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.037
-Just give me two more minutes, huh?
-You said that 20 minutes ago.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.539
Aw, this is stupid, Renko.

09:41.622 --> 09:45.167
I mean, they wouldn't dump
a $310 Smith &amp; Wesson.

09:45.251 --> 09:49.338
If they spied the precinct I.D. number
on the butt, they would.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.593
I mean, who would want to get caught
with a departmental piece?

09:53.968 --> 09:56.554
In which case, what better place
to put the evidence

09:56.637 --> 09:59.640
than back here,
behind the scene of the crime?

09:59.724 --> 10:00.600
(Bates grimacing)

10:00.683 --> 10:02.101
COFFEY: Sound reasoning, Renko.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.978
Just let me know
if you have any luck finding it.

10:05.146 --> 10:05.980
Hey.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.024
Hey, what's going on out here?

10:08.524 --> 10:10.109
-HILL: Well, uh--
-RENKO: Uh, sir.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.403
I'm sorry to be invading
your premises like this,

10:12.486 --> 10:15.865
but we're involved in what you might call
a special-type investigation--

10:16.032 --> 10:18.409
the details of which,
on account of security considerations--

10:18.492 --> 10:21.078
You see, sir, there was a hot pursuit
of several bank robbers

10:21.162 --> 10:23.581
down through this alley here
yesterday, and, uh,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.750
well, we have very good reason to believe

10:25.833 --> 10:29.170
that they may have ditched some
of the money in one of these containers.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.838
-You gotta be kiddin' me.
-TOGETHER: No!

10:30.921 --> 10:32.590
-You-- You mean right down here?
-Yeah.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.133
-In my alley?
-RENKO: Yeah.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.305
Well, uh, how much did they get?

10:40.306 --> 10:41.307
How much did they get?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.810
Uh, well, the bank hasn't calculated
how much yet,

10:44.894 --> 10:47.730
except, uh, it's well in excess of--

10:48.064 --> 10:50.775
-Uh, $60,000.
-$60,000.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.364
Men, we better get back to headquarters
and check on any new leads.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.449
-We'll finish this up later.
-HILL: Yeah.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.909
-No, no.
-Okay.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.745
Uh, yeah, fellas, we'll--
We'll see ya. Huh?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.580
Now, come around any time.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.332
(laughs) Yeah. Any-- Anything we can--

11:06.415 --> 11:08.250
-(car starts)
-Can--

11:17.385 --> 11:21.013
Prunes, prune juice, mineral oil.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.349
You ever have hemorrhoids, Frank?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.226
Can't say as I have, Chief.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.853
You're one of the blessed ones,
believe me.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.774
It's the closest thing in the world
to having a tennis ball up there.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.818
Cheers.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.072
Ooh! (groans)

11:39.365 --> 11:41.492
Weak rectal tissue--
It's hereditary, Frank.

11:43.160 --> 11:43.994
Thank you.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.081
You were saying about
the Sullivan Commission?

11:47.164 --> 11:48.290
Damn it, Frank.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.335
I'm running the cleanest department
in 40 years,

11:51.544 --> 11:53.671
and no little shrimp
of a Michael Sullivan--

11:53.754 --> 11:56.966
who I happen to remember when he was
a shrimp of an assistant D.A.--

11:57.633 --> 12:00.428
is gonna make Lieutenant Governor
by crucifying me.

12:02.930 --> 12:06.016
The Hill's clean, Chief, if that's what
you called me up here to talk about.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.769
I know the Hill's clean.
So's the Heights. So's Midtown.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.523
What I'm worried about, frankly,
is Georgie Haluska in South Ferry.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.568
Nicest guy in the world,
Georgie, but let's face it--

12:16.318 --> 12:18.654
there's an "unflushed" toilet
down there somewhere.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.868
So you're gonna feed George Haluska
to the Sullivan Commission?

12:23.951 --> 12:25.870
This may sound paranoid, Frank,

12:26.454 --> 12:30.458
but in the entire department, there are
only four men that I trust implicitly,

12:30.541 --> 12:32.668
and three of them are sitting right
here at this table.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.421
So word simply can't leak out.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.591
I'm putting you in charge
of the entire operation.

12:40.634 --> 12:41.552
What operation?

12:43.262 --> 12:45.806
We're gonna set up a scam saloon
over in the Ferry, Frank.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.725
Put out the bait for some payoffs.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.270
You'll run it--
in your way, with your men.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.774
Chief, I don't have enough men
to cover the Hill.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.652
We have a major crime-rate increase
of 16 percent,

12:58.736 --> 13:01.322
and I'm so short of personnel
of any description

13:01.447 --> 13:04.492
that I had to take three uniforms
off the street last week

13:04.575 --> 13:06.619
just to take care
of the paperwork up there.

13:06.702 --> 13:10.623
Frank, I'm not just blowing rank air here.
I need you on this one.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.458
Jerry, make a note of it--

13:12.541 --> 13:15.544
We'll transfer two clerks up to the Hill
out of Division as of Monday.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.462
Right.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.298
I know this isn't gonna win you
any Good Samaritan plaques

13:19.381 --> 13:20.800
from the Police Guild, Frank,

13:21.133 --> 13:24.553
but there are too many guys around
that would like nothing better than to see

13:24.637 --> 13:28.474
Fletch Daniels's butt
deep fried in brown sauce.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.392
I hope you're not one of them.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.479
(air hissing)

13:37.233 --> 13:38.692
-(hissing stops)
-(groans)

13:43.614 --> 13:44.573
(groans)

13:49.662 --> 13:50.871
One assurance.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.040
No politics.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.334
No politics, Frank.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.879
We're just gonna do
our own late-inning relief.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.340
They're playing hardball.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.093
We're gonna show 'em
we can play hardball too.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.763
(Fuchs laughing)

14:07.847 --> 14:10.933
Uh, I was just thinking about
that joke I heard on my way over.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.560
You're gonna love this one, Frank.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.772
It seems there were these
two old baseball players--

14:16.856 --> 14:20.276
Uh, Harry and Lou-- and they're talking
about life after death.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.279
...If there's a heaven, and if so,
do they play baseball up there.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.572
Well, they make this pact--

14:25.489 --> 14:27.491
First one to go will
communicate with the other.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.910
So, sure enough, a couple of months later,
Harry passes on.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.288
One night, Lou's lying in bed,

14:32.371 --> 14:35.207
hears a voice, wakes up,
sits up, looks around--

14:35.291 --> 14:36.792
He says, "Harry, is that you?"
He says, "Yeah."

14:37.042 --> 14:40.337
He says, "Where are you?"
He says, "Well, I'm in heaven."

14:40.421 --> 14:43.424
He says, "Hey, terrific.
Well, come on. Let's have it.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.967
Do they play baseball or don't they?"

14:45.050 --> 14:46.844
And he-- Harry says,

14:47.553 --> 14:49.555
"Listen, I got some good news for you
and I got some bad news."

14:49.638 --> 14:50.681
He says, "Yeah?"

14:50.848 --> 14:53.058
He says, "Well, the good news is, sure,
we play almost every day."

14:53.142 --> 14:53.976
He says, "What's the bad news?"

14:54.059 --> 14:56.395
He says, "The bad news is,
you're pitching tomorrow."

14:56.478 --> 14:58.689
(laughing)

14:58.772 --> 15:00.774
Excuse me, Captain. This is for you.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.943
(continues laughing)

15:04.236 --> 15:05.195
It's a subpoena.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.657
"You're pitching tomorrow."

15:09.617 --> 15:10.492
That's good.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.536
(continues laughing)

15:19.919 --> 15:23.297
"You are hereby summoned to appear at 5:00
at the Superior Court Building."

15:23.380 --> 15:25.090
They sure didn't give you much notice.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.843
What do you make of that?

15:28.677 --> 15:33.057
Read between the legalese, Frank.
The intent literally leaps off the page.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.644
In preparation for his
soon-to-be-announced campaign

15:36.727 --> 15:37.811
for the governorship,

15:38.103 --> 15:40.856
Attorney General Michael
"Hatchet Man" Sullivan

15:40.940 --> 15:42.775
desperately requires your presence

15:42.858 --> 15:46.612
before a grand jury
of his special investigating commission

15:46.695 --> 15:47.947
on police corruption.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.743
If it's good for votes,
it's good for Mike.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.954
Okay. So, why me?

15:57.081 --> 15:59.667
Either they want to compliment you
on your taste in clothes,

15:59.750 --> 16:01.293
or they're going to ask you
if you're dirty--

16:01.877 --> 16:03.253
or know anybody who is.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.759
Joyce, Sullivan's had that grand jury
impaneled for over six weeks now,

16:08.842 --> 16:12.638
and he hasn't been able to get past
the fixed ticket and free lunch stage.

16:14.181 --> 16:18.310
The man's gotta find something to justify
that two million dollar commission of his,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.896
and believe me-- knowing Sullivan--

16:21.647 --> 16:23.565
if the dirt doesn't exist,
he'll create it.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.319
Well, Counselor, when it comes
to grand juries, I'm not exactly a virgin,

16:27.403 --> 16:29.571
so if it's a dog-and-pony show
they're after,

16:30.322 --> 16:33.492
I suppose I could dance around the ring
for them for a couple hours.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.205
Uh-oh. Uh--

16:39.623 --> 16:42.126
Could you float me a buck
for another club soda, please?

16:46.338 --> 16:48.549
I hope you don't have
anything to hide, boy scout.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.137
You mean besides the condo in Saint Croix
and the high-priced legal talent?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.313
Man, oh, man, that Denise has got you
so henpecked--

17:03.397 --> 17:04.982
-you don't know if you're coming or going.
-Me henpecked?

17:05.065 --> 17:06.275
-You gotta be kidding.
-"Oh, yes, Denise,

17:06.358 --> 17:07.818
I'll leave my bachelor pad

17:07.901 --> 17:09.778
-for a honeymoon suite."
-Renko, so what if we're living together?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.739
"Where do you want the hope chest, dovey?"

17:11.822 --> 17:13.824
-Knock it off, man.
-"Sure I will, sweetheart."

17:13.907 --> 17:17.119
<i>♪ We'll get married in June ♪</i>

17:17.202 --> 17:19.288
A wedding?
Who said anything about marriage?

17:19.371 --> 17:21.832
"Hey, snookums, you know I've given up
my randy ways.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.417
-I don't believe you.
-I'll never, ever--"

17:23.500 --> 17:26.170
-Hey, Renko-- stop sign!
-(brakes screeching)

17:26.253 --> 17:28.422
-(crash)
-Oh, man.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.924
HILL: Get out the car, Renko!
RENKO: What is that?

17:31.008 --> 17:32.009
HILL: Get out the car!

17:33.594 --> 17:37.181
(siren in distance)

17:39.099 --> 17:41.101
Listen, Joe, you don't
have to play the hero.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.478
If you feel half as bad as you look,

17:42.561 --> 17:44.063
you should just take
the rest of the day off.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.107
-It's okay. I'm fine.
-(clattering)

17:47.191 --> 17:49.568
What, are they washing those dishes
in a cement mixer?

17:52.863 --> 17:54.406
-You sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.202
Darn it, Joseph.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.830
I am ashamed of the way
I acted this morning at roll call.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.083
I mean, you nearly die
in your own bathroom,

18:04.958 --> 18:08.253
and I'm upset about some
lousy breakfast date.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.339
It's just-- It's just stupid.

18:13.050 --> 18:13.884
Hey.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.429
I owe you an apology, pal.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.768
-No problem. Forget about it.
-No.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.645
-Could I have a check, please?
-No, really.

18:25.312 --> 18:29.024
First of all, I never would have slugged
you if I'd have known you was a cop.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.151
Hey, it's history, okay?

18:31.235 --> 18:33.028
Secondly, and more important,

18:34.029 --> 18:36.281
you're not the first guy
my wife picked up in a bar.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.993
You wouldn't believe some of the slobs
she brings home.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.331
I'm thinkin' about putting a turnstile
on the bedroom door.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.252
She probably didn't even tell you
she was married, did she?

18:48.335 --> 18:50.129
Could we talk about this another time?

18:50.671 --> 18:54.383
-Could I have a check, please?
-Personally, I hate violence.

18:55.384 --> 18:59.388
But when I saw you coming out of my door
this morning at 5:30,

18:59.471 --> 19:02.224
with my wife hanging all over you

19:02.307 --> 19:05.227
in that see-through number,
I guess I just snapped.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.147
See, the truth of the matter is,

19:09.815 --> 19:13.694
my wife and I have been undergoing
some serious problems of late,

19:14.570 --> 19:18.657
as a result of which she's been taking out
her anger at me through these

19:18.740 --> 19:20.617
extra-marital encounters.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.785
You mean like with Joe?

19:22.536 --> 19:26.123
The fact is, she probably
wasn't even attracted to him.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.919
Our counselor regards it as a classic
aggression- displacement syndrome.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.298
But I feel it goes back to her
upbringing in Bangor, Maine.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.925
Don't buy me lunch.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.931
I feel a lot better,
now that I've shared this with you.

19:56.778 --> 19:57.613
Would you just push?

19:57.696 --> 20:01.742
I can't help it if a doggone stop sign
just jumps up in front of me like that--

20:01.825 --> 20:04.161
-What do you want me to do, pop a wheelie?
-It wouldn't have jumped up on you, Renko,

20:04.244 --> 20:05.495
if you hadn't been so damn busy

20:05.579 --> 20:08.373
trying to pseudo-psychoanalyze
my domestic life!

20:08.457 --> 20:09.791
You know, we're in a public place here.
A public place.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.543
-I'll deal with you later.
-Hey! You--

20:11.627 --> 20:14.463
You wipe that smirk off your face,
and you take that ghetto blaster,

20:14.546 --> 20:17.174
and you just walk away from here, man.
Walk away from here right now.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.260
Look, you got a registration
to go with this?

20:20.802 --> 20:24.640
-I'm sorry, Officer. It's not my car.
-Aw. Here goes lunch.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.517
No, I mean it's from Manelli Motors,
where I work.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.061
Honest.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.146
Dr. Litvak-- He brought it in last week.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.856
He needed a valve job,

20:33.232 --> 20:35.567
and he won't be picking it up
for another three days,

20:35.943 --> 20:38.987
so Roy said I could take it down
to City Hall for a couple of hours.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.906
Jimmy's brother's getting married
in a half an hour.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.699
Wait, wait-- Wait a minute. Who is Roy?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.827
He's the manager of the garage.
He let me take it.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.621
-No lie.
-You know what?

20:47.955 --> 20:50.249
-I don't feel sorry about you at all.
-Renko, knock it off.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.500
-I don't feel sorry about this at all.
-Go back to your car.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.876
I'm gonna run your license in.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.753
-Oh, baby.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.672
I don't know
what the hell he's talkin' about.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.798
Hey, come on, Roy.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.509
-You told me I could take it. Tell 'em.
-Damn it, Jimmy.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.053
You know how Mr. Manelli is
about customers' wheels.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.721
Ordinarily I'd cover for the kid,

21:04.805 --> 21:07.140
but that's 800 bills' worth,
if it's a dime,

21:07.224 --> 21:09.017
and I ain't puttin' my job on no line.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.519
You're lyin', Roy.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.980
-Be quiet.
-But he gave me the keys, man.

21:13.146 --> 21:16.358
He told me it'd be okay as long as I got
it back before the boss was due.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.402
So you're maintaining
that he stole the car?

21:18.527 --> 21:20.195
-Yeah.
-I didn't steal nothin'!

21:20.279 --> 21:22.239
-He's just lying to save his lousy butt.
-Hey, Jimmy.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.074
Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
Now, be quiet.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.201
It wasn't enough I gave him the rest
of the day off for the wedding.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.203
He wanted some wheels besides.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.123
He's lying, man. I swear to God.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.375
He must have drove it out of here

21:33.458 --> 21:36.211
when I went to pick up that cylinder head
over on Richmond.

21:38.755 --> 21:39.589
LARUE:<i> You know what I mean?</i>

21:39.673 --> 21:41.883
<i>We're talking double-digit</i>
<i>inflation here, Neal.</i>

21:42.968 --> 21:45.512
<i>I could make a bigger return</i>
<i>on my investment if I stuck the bread</i>

21:45.595 --> 21:48.181
<i>in a sock drawer,</i>
<i>so I pulled every penny out and I stuck it</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:50.017
in a ready-asset money mart fund.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.227
Hey, if the prime rate holds,
I'm swimming in it.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.771
Hey, sounds good, babe.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.315
How much you invest?

21:57.232 --> 21:59.318
-Four hundred and 60 bucks.
<i>-</i>NEAL:<i> Whoo!</i>

22:02.112 --> 22:03.989
J.D.:<i> Hey, what's with that dude</i>

22:04.072 --> 22:05.240
Hey, he's cool, babe.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.536
Waiting on an old lady he walked up with--
Probably his mother or something.

22:12.039 --> 22:15.792
(sighs) Thirty-four years old,
in my peak earning years,

22:15.876 --> 22:19.379
and here I sit all day long,
staring at buildings.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.465
I swear, one of these punks
don't hit soon,

22:21.548 --> 22:23.884
I'm gonna jump one
of these old broads myself.

22:24.926 --> 22:25.927
J.D.:<i> Man, I gotta tap a kidney.</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:28.722
<i>Uh, you want a sandwich or something</i>
<i>from the bar across the street?</i>

22:28.805 --> 22:29.765
NEAL: No thanks, man.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.101
Hey, just don't take all day, hey, J.D.?

22:34.061 --> 22:35.896
How long can a quart of gin take?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.374
(blues on jukebox)

23:06.259 --> 23:07.386
Mm-mmm.

23:08.261 --> 23:11.932
All of Hollywood searching
for the perfect sex goddess of the '80s,

23:12.015 --> 23:15.811
and here she is, stacking rocks glasses
in a Fourth Street bar.

23:18.772 --> 23:19.773
Hey, I know what you're thinking.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.150
"He's a handsome devil,
but will he be gentle?"

23:22.234 --> 23:24.111
-Not exactly.
-(laughing)

23:24.653 --> 23:26.488
Well, as long as you're
considering the possibilities,

23:26.571 --> 23:30.784
you wanna write me up for a club soda
and a ham-and-cheese on wheat?

23:31.159 --> 23:31.993
Hmm?

23:32.077 --> 23:33.829
You don't remember me, do you, J.D.?

23:34.830 --> 23:35.747
Well, I--

23:35.831 --> 23:37.416
-Katy Moore?
-Sure. Well, yeah.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.543
I met you at Mulligan's
with Kevin Donleavy

23:39.626 --> 23:40.919
-about two years ago.
-Right, Katy.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.296
Hey, you know how dark
it always was in that joint.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.214
Huh, Katy?

23:45.465 --> 23:48.218
As I recall, it was pretty dark
in my apartment that night, too.

23:48.301 --> 23:49.594
(sighs) Wow.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.347
Hey, I'm sorry, baby.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.476
Look, I was into some pretty major-league
drinking back then, you know?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.562
You must have caught me on a lost weekend.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.147
On the wagon now?

24:01.481 --> 24:02.399
-Six months.

24:02.774 --> 24:03.608
Good.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.320
Uh, let me ask you something.

24:09.489 --> 24:12.826
Did, uh-- Did we have
a good time that night?

24:12.909 --> 24:15.078
(laughs) Yeah.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.082
You gonna talk to me or what?
I said I was sorry.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.337
Look, if-- If the guy hadn't duked me,
I was still gonna meet you.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.715
I was leaving her place
to come and see you.

24:27.048 --> 24:27.883
Thanks a million.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.263
Well, what do you expect me to do?

24:33.722 --> 24:36.641
A guys works a 60-hour job,
he's gotta take it when he can get it.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.894
You wanna keep it till we get in the car?

24:38.977 --> 24:39.978
Yeah, I gotta be at my--

24:40.061 --> 24:43.190
I asked you out plenty of times,
and I never heard more dumb excuses.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.775
JOE: "Luce, you wanna go
to the hot tubs tonight?"

24:45.859 --> 24:47.652
"No, Joe. I gotta do my nails."

24:48.236 --> 24:49.654
-"Maybe we can watch some television."
-No gas cap?

24:49.738 --> 24:51.907
-That's a violation.
-"No, Joe. I gotta get some sleep."

24:51.990 --> 24:52.949
Violation?

24:54.534 --> 24:56.328
I really had the hots for you, Luce.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.458
No side-view mirror?

25:02.459 --> 25:05.337
Buddy, please.
All I did was turn against the light.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.089
-And you wanna know something?
-You don't anymore.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.592
Well, don't look at me like it's my fault.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.010
BATES: Well, then, whose fault is it?

25:12.093 --> 25:15.931
Lucy, we both have a lot of displaced
anger towards each other, that's all.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.892
Yours might be displaced. Mine's not.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.480
No horn.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.233
You know, all my life
I've had this compulsion

25:26.316 --> 25:28.527
to dominate every woman
that came in my life.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.445
It was like a disease.

25:30.987 --> 25:34.157
Oh, who you kidding?
So you took two aspirin, and it's gone.

25:34.950 --> 25:38.495
But you taught me how to discriminate
between the women I work with

25:38.578 --> 25:39.829
and the women I romance.

25:42.707 --> 25:43.750
Sign.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.838
Okay, so you wanna take
a hot tub with me tonight?

25:51.633 --> 25:52.509
Eat a worm.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.270
NEAL: Tap the kidney, eh, babe?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.814
If you can't get me at home,
you can try the number here--

26:06.231 --> 26:08.191
Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.656
I will commit this number to memory.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.882
(screams)

26:34.718 --> 26:37.554
-(tires screeching)
-(onlookers clamoring)

26:48.815 --> 26:49.899
-Hold it!
-Hold it.

26:50.483 --> 26:51.901
Thanks for the backup, men.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.279
What the hell is--

27:02.746 --> 27:04.748
-You should be ashamed of yourself--
-Mom--

27:04.831 --> 27:06.416
-locking up an innocent young man--
-Mom, it isn't his fault.

27:06.499 --> 27:09.169
-It's that stinkin' liar Roy.
-Be quiet, you troublemaker.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.837
MAN: $50 it cost me to bail you out-- $50.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.548
It took me five hours
to do my hair this morning.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.593
-In there, and shut up.
-Hi, Leo.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.178
Hey, Cooper, take these guys,
will you, man?

27:19.387 --> 27:21.389
Caught some of them, Leo--
the welfare muggers.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.766
Not the Captain.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.560
I want this golf ball booked,
locked up, or I quit.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.270
Professional rivalry here, Leo.

27:27.354 --> 27:30.231
I was directly responsible
for the apprehension of the criminals.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.275
-The collar is mine.
-This guy is a suicidal maniac.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.568
He's a menace to public safety,

27:33.652 --> 27:35.362
and he leaped in front
of a fleeing vehicle.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.906
CAPTAIN FREEDOM: My intent was to cushion
the impact with my body.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.159
See? The guy's got a 50-knot breeze
between his ears.

27:41.576 --> 27:42.994
All right, I'm getting tired of this.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.748
Grant Newcomb, federal investigator.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.753
And before you start with the "he's loony"
business, hotshot,

27:51.836 --> 27:53.213
maybe you just better listen.

27:53.713 --> 27:58.468
I've been on the street three months,
with counterparts in 17 major cities.

27:58.551 --> 28:03.223
We are the vanguard of a task force that
is studying the tactical reaction time

28:03.306 --> 28:04.891
of urban police forces.

28:05.183 --> 28:09.562
Now, this is vitally important,
with respect to an extrapolation

28:09.729 --> 28:13.858
predicting an epidemic
of metropolitan crime in the next decade.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.276
Here. Pass it around.

28:16.236 --> 28:20.699
Sure, the costume's silly, but it gets
me in and out of crime situations

28:20.782 --> 28:24.202
with a minimum of risk
and without arousing suspicion.

28:24.285 --> 28:27.664
I couldn't very well go around holding up
liquor stores, now could I?

28:27.747 --> 28:29.040
If you want confirmation,

28:29.499 --> 28:33.837
call this TRANS-STAT number
in Montgomery, Alabama.

28:34.337 --> 28:37.382
It's a logistics center
on the niner-five profile

28:37.966 --> 28:40.802
with a direct satellite feed
to Washington.

28:41.344 --> 28:44.889
Thank you, Off-- Uh, Agent Newcomb.

28:46.933 --> 28:50.729
Then again, the Astro Space Zombies
may have destroyed it by now.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.063
J.D.: Can't take it.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.857
-I'm gonna kill him.
-Be cool, babe.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.322
You know what this is, Frank?

29:02.574 --> 29:03.992
-Looks like a subpoena.
-It's a subpoena.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.203
The Sullivan Commission has asked me
to testify this afternoon.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.956
Do you want to know
why I'm as pleased as punch?

29:10.039 --> 29:11.583
-Good question, Howard.
-Well...

29:11.666 --> 29:13.001
-I went through all the possibilities.
-He's here.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.253
-I'll call you back.
-Could it be expense account vouchers?

29:15.336 --> 29:16.546
-Of course not.
-As soon as I know, you'll know.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.757
Could it be procedural impropriety?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.383
-Impossible.
-I love you, too.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.177
You know, I was a bit confused at first.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.597
I mean, why subpoena me to
an investigation of in-house corruption?

29:26.389 --> 29:28.600
Then it came clear-- the book.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.186
What book, Howard?

29:32.312 --> 29:35.565
My book--
<i>Third World Dysgenics, the Urban Crisis.</i>

29:35.648 --> 29:36.524
They got wind of it.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.444
They want me to come down there
and fill in the landscape for them.

29:39.944 --> 29:40.987
They said that?

29:41.362 --> 29:42.906
Well, it's the only thing that applies.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.492
And believe you me,
I'm gonna give those gavel jockeys

29:45.575 --> 29:46.618
more than they bargained for.

29:46.701 --> 29:48.578
I'm gonna bring the ambulance to the door.

29:48.661 --> 29:52.832
It's their own half-baked liberal provisos
that have led to this dry rot,

29:52.916 --> 29:54.042
and I'm gonna lay it on the line.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.588
It's too bad that they didn't
call you fellas.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.217
-Think again, Howard.
-I got one too.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.345
Oh, this is a virtual coup.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.015
Between the three of us,

30:09.182 --> 30:11.726
this whole plague of corruption
and ill-guided reform

30:11.810 --> 30:13.520
can be squeezed out into the open.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.064
You could always read them
the foreword to your book, Howard.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.398
HUNTER: Yes.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.234
Yes.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.530
A profound statement like that
read into the record--

30:23.613 --> 30:25.073
That could be the beginning of something.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.116
I've gotta look over my notes.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.536
I've got a concluding paragraph
I've gotta punch up.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.374
You're not worried, are you, Ray?

30:35.166 --> 30:36.501
I don't understand, Frank.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.712
After 18 years of dedicated service.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.299
When do they want you?

30:44.509 --> 30:47.011
Soon. Very soon.

30:52.642 --> 30:59.482
(speaking French)

30:59.566 --> 31:05.405
(speaking French)

31:05.488 --> 31:07.198
You speak the language.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.576
Enough to get elected treasurer
of my high school French club.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.161
Oh,<i> très bien, mon ami. Superbe.</i>

31:12.871 --> 31:15.331
And you are a man who can
appreciate the importance

31:15.415 --> 31:17.542
of what I carry here in my pocket.

31:20.378 --> 31:23.381
-Is that, uh, a travel deposit?
<i>-Mais oui.</i>

31:23.464 --> 31:26.885
Grace and I have arranged
a sabbatical to the country of kings.

31:26.968 --> 31:30.054
We'll live as Frenchmen,
talk the language, uh...

31:30.555 --> 31:33.516
make love with the same
aristocracy of passion.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.185
-(Phil laughs)
-Sounds authentic.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.314
Oh, I'm there every night in my dreams.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.859
The sun on the vines at Clos Vougeot.

31:43.985 --> 31:48.197
The cypresses draping the road
from Angoulême to Châtellerault.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.034
-The--
-Phones that don't work,

31:51.117 --> 31:52.702
plumbing built in 12 A.D.,

31:53.661 --> 31:55.955
pastries that give you colonic dysentery

31:56.039 --> 31:58.166
and toilet tissue that's like wax paper.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.711
Etranger.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.384
Come on, move it, water lily.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.471
CAPTAIN FREEDOM: Stop it.
These gloves were a gift from Orgon.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.849
And I'll give 'em back to you
as soon as I fingerprint you, I promise.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.602
You can't give them back to me
because I'm not going to give them to you.

32:17.685 --> 32:18.937
-Please?
-Buchanan.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.648
Put him in water before he wilts.

32:23.232 --> 32:26.527
-Why won't you take off your gloves?
-What's goin' on here?

32:26.694 --> 32:29.697
Mick, old friend,
would you kindly tell this man

32:29.781 --> 32:32.575
why it is impossible to fingerprint
Captain Freedom?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.078
I don't know why.

32:37.956 --> 32:38.790
Why is it?

32:40.291 --> 32:42.585
Well, maybe it is okay.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.589
What are you doin', Leo? What's goin' on?

32:46.798 --> 32:49.509
LaRue and Washington
brought him in on charges.

32:49.968 --> 32:50.927
Same story.

32:52.762 --> 32:53.846
What's the matter with you?

32:54.472 --> 32:57.016
Why didn't you tell those bozos
you were a friend of mine?

32:57.433 --> 32:59.394
It's not right to lean
on your friends, Mick.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.022
I got him, Leo. Come on.

33:09.612 --> 33:12.156
You and I had a discussion
a while back, didn't we?

33:12.782 --> 33:14.158
I thought you were through with this.

33:15.827 --> 33:16.703
Orders, Mick.

33:17.286 --> 33:20.415
I've been recruited
by the Neptunian Anti-Crime Patrol.

33:20.498 --> 33:23.751
They transmit voice commands to me
while I'm sleeping in my closet.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.003
Do you ever stop and--

33:26.254 --> 33:27.588
You sleep in a closet?

33:28.214 --> 33:30.425
There's not nearly
enough room in the microwave.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.679
What am I gonna do with you?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.056
I don't know. Kick me loose?

33:39.976 --> 33:42.395
Listen to me.
You gotta get ahold of yourself.

33:42.478 --> 33:45.481
This<i> Alice in Wonderland</i>
stuff is fun, but it's gotta stop.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.776
I'm standing here watching you
drift farther and farther away.

33:49.277 --> 33:53.364
You gotta get straight.
You gotta put yourself back in reality.

33:55.533 --> 33:56.826
What is reality, Mick?

33:57.910 --> 33:59.579
You ever seen the nucleus of an atom?

34:00.079 --> 34:02.874
Yet the existence of the entire universe
depends on it.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.667
You ever touch the human soul?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.795
Yet it drives you more strongly
than any muscle in your body.

34:07.879 --> 34:12.925
We step in and out of reality
at every instant of our lives,

34:13.009 --> 34:18.264
and yet we persist in reducing everything
that we see to bland and secure terms.

34:18.765 --> 34:22.435
A single fly is capable of laying
more than 20 million eggs.

34:22.518 --> 34:26.481
Leo Tolstoy pulled<i> War and Peace</i>
from the nothingness of pure thought.

34:27.190 --> 34:31.235
The gold in your teeth was manufactured
in the interior of an exploding star.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.863
What is reality? Who governs it?
What are the rules?

34:34.405 --> 34:39.035
Who is to say that at this very moment
I and everything around you

34:39.118 --> 34:42.955
are nothing but the creation
of your own cosmic dreams?

34:43.456 --> 34:44.415
Yeah.

34:46.626 --> 34:50.630
(whispering) Actually, my goal is to have
a sandwich named after me.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.890
All you have to do is,
you walk up and you say,

35:00.973 --> 35:03.810
"Sarge, I lost my weapon." It's that easy.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.521
I do not wish to hear any suggestions
from this side of the room

35:06.604 --> 35:08.272
concerning my implement,
thank you very much.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.066
-I can handle it myself.
-All right.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.735
What are you doing?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.738
Can't you see that the angle
you have drawn

35:15.822 --> 35:20.535
representing the collision course
of our two vehicles is shy 45 degrees?

35:21.160 --> 35:24.705
I swear, if it wasn't for the white man's
higher order of math intellect,

35:24.789 --> 35:26.707
we'd still think the world was flat,
wouldn't we?

35:26.791 --> 35:29.710
And maybe if you close your eyes
and wish real hard,

35:29.794 --> 35:31.462
it'll be under your pillow in the morning.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.967
Do you boys know anything about a gal
calling in for a salt-and-pepper team?

35:36.843 --> 35:39.262
That came in a few minutes ago,
but she didn't know the names.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.179
It's Trina.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.099
And a guy called Roy
who put her boyfriend in Mercy Hospital.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.645
Hey, Sergeant, you got
a spare unit we can use?

35:47.937 --> 35:51.774
Unless I'm mistaken, we've yet to resolve
the matter of your prior unit.

35:51.858 --> 35:52.859
Well, it's real important, Sarge.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.027
-It's an emergency, practically.
-All right.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.822
Grab a key off the board,
and watch your fingers if Leo sees you.

35:57.905 --> 36:01.534
And bring this one back intact,
or keep driving.

36:06.414 --> 36:10.334
(siren wailing)

36:10.418 --> 36:13.713
-Oh, man.
-It's broken in two places.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.465
Look kind of like a champ, huh?

36:17.341 --> 36:18.342
How'd it happen, son?

36:18.843 --> 36:21.888
We went back to the garage.
See, I figured it out.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.640
Last month, we had a couple
of robbers come in,

36:25.141 --> 36:28.019
and since then, Roy's been keeping
the car keys in a locked box.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.022
So you see, there was no way
that I could get that key

36:31.606 --> 36:33.357
without him opening that box for me.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.153
So I called him a liar, and he got hot.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.285
You think maybe we could
go back there now?

36:47.288 --> 36:49.624
You see this? It's locked. Locked, locked!

36:49.707 --> 36:51.751
You took the key out of the coffee cup.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.586
You're out of your shorts, man.

36:53.669 --> 36:54.670
-What coffee cup?
-HILL: Jerry.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.964
-He saw me put the key here.
-You're a liar!

36:57.048 --> 36:58.674
(all shouting)

36:58.758 --> 37:02.303
-(indistinct shouting)
-You fat, ugly slime face.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.846
-Pig head.
-Quiet.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.598
-Dog brain!
-Be quiet.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.683
(all talking)

37:07.767 --> 37:10.228
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.
-Come here. Come here.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.313
-Lady, knock it off.
-Hey, don't you do that. Look at this.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.273
-I got this club, and I'll use it--
-Lady, hey!

37:14.357 --> 37:16.567
-Get over here. I mean it. Get over here.
-HILL: Just walk it off.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.985
Get over here and be quiet.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.946
Everyone, listen up for a second.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.699
Now, my partner and I
have no way of knowing

37:23.783 --> 37:25.409
for sure who's telling the truth here,

37:26.202 --> 37:27.620
and neither will a judge,

37:27.995 --> 37:30.790
so if you press charges for auto theft,
and you for assault,

37:31.374 --> 37:33.000
chances are you both are gonna lose.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.753
Do you understand that?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.673
-Do you?
<i>-People versus Esterhaus--</i>

37:39.048 --> 37:42.093
Famous case.
Equal and opposing participles.

37:42.843 --> 37:46.639
Yeah, well, what about the damage
to Dr. Litvak's Lincoln?

37:46.722 --> 37:48.891
There's 800, 1,000 bucks there.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.310
Look, I want some law enforcement here.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.979
-"Law enforcement"?
-Well, now.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.606
Mr. Manelli, you have a small garage here.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.692
Obliges you to park three
or four of these cars

37:57.775 --> 37:58.985
out in that red zone all day long,
does it?

37:59.068 --> 38:02.405
RENKO: Let's say we practice this
law enforcement that you'd like us to do,

38:02.488 --> 38:04.198
and we came by here, say,
three or four times a day,

38:04.282 --> 38:07.118
five days a week, at $25 a ticket--

38:07.201 --> 38:09.745
Now work that out
on your calculator, Professor.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.330
Uh, let's see here.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.627
Whoa! Cowboy, that's $2,500 a week.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.422
RENKO: $2,500 a week,
but there is a solution.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.756
I'll tell you what we're gonna do for you.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.175
Let's have handshakes all around.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.760
That means you give him his job back,

38:24.844 --> 38:26.512
the insurance pays for
the damage to the Lincoln,

38:26.595 --> 38:27.430
and everything is hunky-dory.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.765
No harm, no foul.
Thank you, Professor Hill.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.689
The guy is going to his brother's wedding.

38:36.772 --> 38:39.900
You stop short,
and he plows into the rear of our car.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.945
He winds up no job,
a broken nose, arrested,

38:43.029 --> 38:46.699
plus he's on the hook for bail money.
Not to mention a torn tux.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.952
And you say, "No harm, no foul."

38:50.494 --> 38:51.954
Where in the hell have you been all day?

38:52.747 --> 38:54.749
What is justice, my man?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.917
What is justice?

38:57.001 --> 39:02.715
DISPATCHER:<i> All units in the vicinity.</i>
<i>The man with the gun at 717 West 114th--</i>

39:02.798 --> 39:04.550
Hey, that sounds close, cowboy.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.263
(siren blaring)

39:14.435 --> 39:17.021
What is justice, my man?

39:22.234 --> 39:25.237
I have this terrible sinking feeling
in my gut, Frank.

39:25.488 --> 39:26.322
Relax, Ray.

39:27.740 --> 39:30.284
It's just a formality, nothing more.
Believe me.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.787
-You think so?
-Piece of cake.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.502
They're not interested
in<i> Third World Dysgenics.</i>

39:39.585 --> 39:41.087
They want my financial records.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.214
Judas Priest, Frank.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.257
If they're putting the brown shaft
to our types,

39:45.341 --> 39:47.676
can you imagine what they've got in store
for this hombre?

39:47.760 --> 39:50.888
-Howard.
-After 18 years of dedicated service.

39:50.971 --> 39:54.809
Well, I mean, who knows what skeletons
a Caribbean past can hold?

39:55.976 --> 39:59.980
Ray, you weren't involved in that
Bay of Pigs fiasco, by any chance?

40:00.064 --> 40:01.732
-(door opens)
-WOMAN: Captain Furillo?

40:02.149 --> 40:04.402
Loose lips sink ships, Frank.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.577
Ask not for whom the bell tolls, Ray.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.621
It tolls for thee.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.333
(speaks Spanish)

40:19.417 --> 40:22.795
Captain Furillo has received
five meritorious commendations,

40:22.878 --> 40:26.424
three medallions, and seven promotions
during his years on the force.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.008
I commend you, Captain.

40:29.009 --> 40:29.844
Thank you.

40:30.719 --> 40:34.181
Now, I have one very simple question
to ask you.

40:35.015 --> 40:36.517
Are you now, or have you ever been aware,

40:36.600 --> 40:38.519
of any wrongdoings
in the police department?

40:39.770 --> 40:41.439
That's a broad question, Mr. Peck.

40:42.565 --> 40:46.694
I've been in the department for 17 years,
and wrongdoing, to go by the book,

40:47.653 --> 40:51.157
can apply to just about anything,
right on down to the office football pool,

40:51.240 --> 40:53.159
which, yes, we're not without.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.120
Well, perhaps I can help you a little bit.

40:56.829 --> 41:00.958
By "wrongdoings," or corruption,
I mean serious wrongdoings, Captain--

41:01.625 --> 41:04.545
any act for which a police officer
could be convicted of a felony.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.964
And I will limit "at any time"
to that period

41:07.047 --> 41:09.633
since the Kraft Commission,
five and a half years ago.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.177
Does that make it easier for you?

41:12.094 --> 41:15.264
I have no personal knowledge
of any indictable crime

41:15.347 --> 41:17.516
committed by an officer
during that period--

41:18.726 --> 41:21.353
except for those crimes
that are already public knowledge

41:21.437 --> 41:25.566
and for which prosecutions
have already been instituted.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.610
No personal knowledge?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.153
That's correct.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.032
Captain Furillo, who said anything
about personal knowledge?

41:33.866 --> 41:37.119
That's the biggest evasion of them all.
We're a grand jury here.

41:37.786 --> 41:40.164
What we are interested in is,
what have you heard?

41:40.247 --> 41:41.499
What's on the grapevine?

41:42.249 --> 41:44.376
Now I ask you to reconsider
your answer, Captain,

41:44.460 --> 41:46.378
and to remember, you're under oath.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.090
As a matter of fact, just to be
on the safe side, Ms. Jackson,

41:51.175 --> 41:52.885
would you read the captain his rights?

41:53.677 --> 41:57.598
"As the possible target of a grand jury
investigation you have certain rights.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.850
-You have the right--"
-I'm aware of my rights, Mr. Peck.

42:00.226 --> 42:01.060
Good.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.855
Then perhaps I can assist your memory
just a little bit further.

42:06.232 --> 42:12.363
Are you now, or have you ever been aware
of any alleged corruption in this city's

42:12.446 --> 42:14.490
South Ferry precinct?

42:15.032 --> 42:18.452
Indeed, isn't it a matter
of common knowledge, Captain,

42:18.536 --> 42:20.871
that a detective pad
exists in that precinct,

42:20.955 --> 42:23.666
and isn't it a fact that that precinct

42:23.749 --> 42:27.127
is an embarrassment to the upper echelons
of the police department?

42:28.420 --> 42:29.797
There have been rumors, yes.

42:30.589 --> 42:33.467
Then you do have knowledge of crimes.

42:33.551 --> 42:37.388
Rumor does not constitute
knowledge, Mr. Peck.

42:37.721 --> 42:38.931
As a matter of fact,

42:39.014 --> 42:41.308
I would feel more comfortable
discussing these matters

42:41.392 --> 42:47.189
if this grand jury, since its inception,
had, for just one day, met its obligation

42:47.273 --> 42:48.607
of absolute secrecy.

42:49.775 --> 42:53.529
Instead, stories have leaked out
to the press every day this week

42:53.612 --> 42:55.239
directly from this room.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.701
Captain Furillo, do you wish
to take the Fifth Amendment?

42:58.784 --> 43:01.370
Are you implying I'm guilty
of a crime, Mr. Peck?

43:01.453 --> 43:04.290
I'm implying that you may have
perjured yourself today.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.876
I'm guilty of nothing--
but given the prevailing atmosphere,

43:07.960 --> 43:10.754
clearly it would be inadvisable for me
or my colleagues

43:10.838 --> 43:13.048
to say any more without advice of counsel.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.758
You will excuse me please.

43:19.221 --> 43:20.180
Frank, what happened?

43:21.307 --> 43:25.936
(clamoring)

43:36.989 --> 43:39.867
Leo, somebody spilled water
on the front steps.

43:40.534 --> 43:41.368
Yes, ma'am.

43:41.660 --> 43:42.494
I just thought you ought to know

43:42.578 --> 43:44.747
before somebody slips
and breaks their neck.

43:45.706 --> 43:48.042
You mean after all that,
they never even got to you?

43:48.459 --> 43:53.005
I have to go back tomorrow.
Eighteen years of dedicated service.

43:54.256 --> 43:55.549
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Oh, hello, Fay.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.259
Francis isn't back
from the grand jury yet.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.345
-Cup of Sumatra?
-No, thank you, Phil.

44:01.513 --> 44:02.598
Something the matter, Fay?

44:03.307 --> 44:05.267
I hope you had that checked
like I told you.

44:06.143 --> 44:10.022
Black mole cancer, Ray.
I mean, it can just get you like that.

44:10.105 --> 44:11.607
You'll be dead within four weeks.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.942
There are worse things than cancer,
Mrs. Furillo.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.113
Excuse me, Fay.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.950
Say, fellas, can I see you
in the captain's office?

44:28.499 --> 44:30.876
I hope your loved ones
are well taken care of.

44:31.126 --> 44:34.588
Oh, I take very good care
of my loved ones, Mrs. Furillo.

44:36.215 --> 44:37.841
Look, Sarge,
if it's about that second unit

44:37.925 --> 44:39.551
me and Renko tore up, we can explain that.

44:39.635 --> 44:40.719
It's not about that, Bobby.

44:40.803 --> 44:42.054
In fact,<i> mes enfants,</i>

44:42.137 --> 44:46.058
you two aren't even gonna get near
a squad car for the next several days.

44:46.141 --> 44:48.811
Aw, Sarge,
I'll plain croak out there on foot patrol.

44:48.894 --> 44:50.938
Please let me explain
my vehicular situation to you before--

44:51.021 --> 44:52.564
Do you mind, Renko?

44:55.025 --> 44:56.568
What I was commencing to inform you

44:56.652 --> 44:58.821
is that you've both
been selected to participate

44:58.904 --> 45:00.698
in a major undercover operation.

45:01.657 --> 45:05.160
I can't give you the details now,
except that it involves a scam saloon,

45:06.453 --> 45:08.205
and we'll be going
after some fairly big fish.

45:08.288 --> 45:09.790
-Are you interested?
-Yes.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.792
-(intercom buzzes)
-(chuckles) Excuse me.

45:13.001 --> 45:15.546
Now listen, cowboy, it's a great chance,
but they're gonna find out

45:15.629 --> 45:16.672
-about that stolen gun--
-Esterhaus.

45:16.755 --> 45:18.424
-Oh, yes, Mr. Salbeni.
-so you better tell them before they do.

45:18.507 --> 45:21.677
-We don't want to blow this one.
-Just a minute, Mr. Salbeni.

45:22.094 --> 45:27.099
Uh, you two know anything about a garbage
dispute over by the Kubiak Lodge?

45:27.850 --> 45:30.477
Sanitation won't pick up.
Says the stuff's all over the block.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.272
Gotta bag it, Sarge.
Those merchants know that.

45:38.110 --> 45:40.487
I'll have to get back to you
on that one, Mr. Salbeni.

45:42.948 --> 45:43.782
Sarge?

45:44.908 --> 45:47.619
Do you think I could have a word
with you in private, please?

45:48.996 --> 45:50.289
All right, Andy.

45:50.372 --> 45:52.791
I have this friend
named Shirley Battaglia,

45:52.875 --> 45:55.753
you know, she just went in for her
regular ob-gyn checkup.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.588
Before you could say "hysterectomy,"

45:57.671 --> 46:00.758
they'd yanked out her fallopian tubes,
both ovaries and her uterus.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.677
Two days later they found
a lump in her husband's ear.

46:04.845 --> 46:05.679
Cancer?

46:06.638 --> 46:09.141
(sighs) I don't know, Henry.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.936
You know, it just seems like
everywhere you look

46:13.020 --> 46:15.731
it's just death, death, death.

46:19.109 --> 46:22.321
So, uh, I was kind of embarrassed,
you know, Sarge?

46:23.489 --> 46:25.908
(clicks tongue)
You should have reported it immediately.

46:27.493 --> 46:30.162
If the weapon were later used
in the commission of a felony--

46:35.709 --> 46:38.545
I'll call around.
I'll see if anything turns up.

46:39.713 --> 46:41.340
Sure you don't want a cup of coffee, Fay?

46:41.423 --> 46:43.759
Hmm, I guess you didn't read about
those coffee tests

46:43.842 --> 46:45.427
on laboratory rats, did you?

46:46.929 --> 46:49.056
(sighs) I guess Frank's not coming back.

46:51.558 --> 46:52.768
I don't know, Henry.

46:53.435 --> 46:56.396
You know, it just seems like nothing
means anything anymore.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.191
It's just one gigantic crap shoot.

47:01.443 --> 47:03.821
We live. (sighs) We die.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.031
We know not why.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.117
Oh, Leo, do you smell gas?

47:09.993 --> 47:12.371
No. No, I don't, Mrs. Furillo. Do you?

47:23.048 --> 47:25.384
(moans)

47:27.094 --> 47:28.220
You know, Frank,

47:29.888 --> 47:31.765
I underestimated Michael Sullivan.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.520
Apparently, there's something personal
going on between him and Daniels.

47:36.603 --> 47:37.729
"Apparently"?

47:38.313 --> 47:41.775
They knew precisely what Daniels
had discussed with me at breakfast.

47:42.442 --> 47:44.194
-How?
-How do I know how?

47:44.278 --> 47:45.946
Spies, informants.

47:47.364 --> 47:50.325
Daniels says I'm one of only four people

47:50.409 --> 47:52.494
in the entire department
he trusts totally.

47:52.578 --> 47:54.663
That may be his normal
flair for melodrama, but--

47:54.746 --> 47:59.001
The mysterious intrigues
of the Byzantium Police Department.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.635
I'm sorry, Frank.

48:10.637 --> 48:12.222
I know this could get ugly for you.

48:12.556 --> 48:15.475
Hmm. Will you visit me in prison?

48:15.851 --> 48:17.352
(laughs)

48:18.186 --> 48:19.146
Every Sunday--

48:20.731 --> 48:23.442
with a basket of fruit
and the Sunday papers.

48:24.401 --> 48:26.486
Then I'm not afraid of Michael Sullivan--

48:29.156 --> 48:30.657
Not this moment, anyway.

48:33.035 --> 48:33.869
Mm.

48:35.162 --> 48:36.246
Mm, mm.

48:46.131 --> 48:49.176
(closing theme playing)
