00:00.774 --> 00:02.280
Previously on boston legal

00:02.315 --> 00:05.056
I have an 80% chance
of getting alzheimer's?

00:05.091 --> 00:07.354
Have you been feeling
other symptoms lately?

00:07.389 --> 00:09.370
Sometimes i feel
a little foggy.

00:09.405 --> 00:10.805
I don't seem
to always get things.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.192
We all know it,
we laugh it off,

00:12.227 --> 00:14.138
We say,
"isn't the mad cow cute?"

00:14.173 --> 00:17.373
At what point do we all admit
the man needs help?

00:17.408 --> 00:20.384
-The firm is going broke?
-We may have to shut our doors.

00:20.419 --> 00:22.016
Did i know this
and forget?

00:22.051 --> 00:24.327
You've been almost like
a big sister to me.

00:24.362 --> 00:26.592
If you knew
this crazy catherine piper...

00:26.627 --> 00:28.369
do you think
they considered me sane?

00:28.404 --> 00:31.027
If only they could know you
like i do.

00:54.524 --> 00:56.073
Hello, dear.

00:56.192 --> 00:57.496
May i help you?

00:57.531 --> 00:59.705
Yeah, i'm looking
for a lawyer.

00:59.740 --> 01:02.015
Uh, yes,
i suspected as much.

01:02.050 --> 01:03.702
You're in a law firm.

01:03.737 --> 01:05.902
Uh, what have you done, dear?

01:05.937 --> 01:09.319
Well, i, uh, i got
into harvard, and then--

01:09.354 --> 01:12.781
A pretty little thing like you?
Oh, please.

01:12.816 --> 01:14.156
Who'd we do, sweetheart?

01:14.191 --> 01:17.595
Then they rescinded
my admission,

01:17.630 --> 01:18.750
And now i would like
to sue them.

01:18.785 --> 01:20.134
Of course you would.

01:20.169 --> 01:23.709
Um, katie, be a dear
and help this young lady.

01:23.744 --> 01:26.057
Uh, katie will
help you, dear.

01:29.651 --> 01:30.893
Why don't we go
to the conference room?

01:30.928 --> 01:32.013
Okey.

01:34.189 --> 01:35.308
Hello.

01:36.068 --> 01:37.060
Who are you?

01:37.095 --> 01:39.740
Uh, i'm catherine, honey. D--

01:40.075 --> 01:41.142
Who are you?

01:41.177 --> 01:42.942
Carl sack.
May i help you?

01:42.977 --> 01:47.737
I doubt it.
Uh, you strike me as pushy.

01:48.284 --> 01:49.263
May i ask,

01:49.298 --> 01:51.940
And i think i may,
being, uh, a senior partner,

01:51.975 --> 01:55.507
Just wh-What...
what are you doing here?

01:55.542 --> 01:58.186
I work here, dear.

01:58.221 --> 01:58.848
You work here?

01:58.883 --> 02:00.991
Yes, dear.
Who hired you?

02:01.026 --> 02:05.535
Shirley schmidt did, dear.
She's my older sister.

02:05.570 --> 02:06.738
I think if shirley schmidt
had hired you,

02:06.773 --> 02:09.067
-She would've told me.
-Really?

02:09.102 --> 02:11.257
Does she
tell you everything?

02:11.292 --> 02:13.827
Did she tell you she went
to cabo for the week?

02:13.862 --> 02:14.548
She did,

02:14.583 --> 02:18.491
And she left me
a contact number...

02:18.526 --> 02:20.486
if you can imagine.

02:20.521 --> 02:21.687
Well, that's lovely.

02:22.065 --> 02:23.390
Did she tell you her calls

02:23.425 --> 02:26.079
Were being forwarded
to her younger sister?

02:26.290 --> 02:29.231
Hello.
Who's calling, please?

02:29.266 --> 02:31.734
Is it the pushy man?

03:02.968 --> 03:04.667
Okay, denny,
i want you to count backwards

03:04.702 --> 03:06.441
By sevens from a hundred.

03:06.992 --> 03:08.136
Why?

03:08.171 --> 03:10.067
It's just a test.

03:11.195 --> 03:12.949
100.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.119
93.

03:14.154 --> 03:16.730
Uh, 86.

03:16.765 --> 03:18.448
81.

03:18.483 --> 03:20.273
75.

03:20.308 --> 03:22.047
4--4, i meant to say.

03:22.082 --> 03:26.095
4. Uh, 1984,
like the orwell--

03:26.130 --> 03:28.158
74.

03:28.193 --> 03:29.389
Who the hell wrote that?

03:29.424 --> 03:32.021
No, no, you were down to
74 not 84.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.844
W-Whatever.

03:33.879 --> 03:35.028
Continue, please.

03:35.063 --> 03:36.491
74.

03:36.526 --> 03:38.170
67.

03:38.205 --> 03:41.209
Hell of year--'67.
The sox won the pennant.

03:41.244 --> 03:43.613
Jimmy lonborg pitched
a 2-Hitter second game,

03:43.648 --> 03:46.981
And yaz plunked two out.
Hell of a game.

03:47.016 --> 03:49.692
Who pitched the first game
of tt world series?

03:49.727 --> 03:52.275
Jose santiago against, uh,
bob gibson.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.962
Gibson pitched, uh, three times,
won the series.

03:54.997 --> 03:58.221
Who's the best pitcher
for the sox this year?

04:03.095 --> 04:06.904
Don't tell me. Uh... uh...
josh pecker.

04:06.939 --> 04:09.061
Hell of a pitcher, pecker.

04:10.860 --> 04:11.800
Who's the best hitter?

04:11.835 --> 04:15.896
Uh, that's, uh, that black guy--
Uh, the, um--

04:15.931 --> 04:17.469
Ortiz. David ortiz.

04:17.504 --> 04:20.966
He's half black, half mexican,
half dominican.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.141
Who's the president
of the united states?

04:23.176 --> 04:25.805
Barack obama.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.541
He's half hawaiian, half kenyan
half black and half,

04:30.576 --> 04:32.831
Uh, halle berry.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.182
It has progressed.

04:34.217 --> 04:35.877
Last year,
we were at stage,

04:35.912 --> 04:38.867
Which is basically
mild cognitive decline.

04:38.902 --> 04:42.202
Now it's more like stage 4,
which is moderate.

04:42.237 --> 04:44.146
Talk to me like i'm
in the room, would you?

04:44.181 --> 04:45.359
I am.

04:46.001 --> 04:47.801
You remember yesterday
very well,

04:47.836 --> 04:51.556
But forming new memories
is obviously more difficult.

04:52.168 --> 04:53.787
Cut to the punch line.

04:54.510 --> 04:56.686
You're in the early stages
of alzheimer's.

04:56.721 --> 04:59.298
We're not talking about
precursor's anymore.

05:00.246 --> 05:02.093
It's here.

05:24.025 --> 05:25.345
Academic doping?

05:25.665 --> 05:28.051
Yeah. You find a friend
with a prescription

05:28.086 --> 05:29.724
For ritalin or adderall,

05:29.759 --> 05:32.947
And you pop some pills to help study
and stay focused the day of the s.A.T.

05:32.982 --> 05:36.665
-And you did this?
-Yeah. It's not illegal.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.984
And how'd you do
on the s.A.T.?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.815
I got a perfect score.

05:40.850 --> 05:42.519
And i was accepted
to harvard...

05:42.554 --> 05:44.301
which is fairly newsworthy

05:44.336 --> 05:47.723
Given i went to your average
small-Town public school.

05:47.758 --> 05:50.563
I did an interview
with the local paper...

05:50.650 --> 05:52.173
where i was quoted as saying

05:52.208 --> 05:54.814
Ritalin was a godsend
when it came to test taking.

05:54.849 --> 05:57.159
And that sparked a whole debate
in the comments section--

05:57.194 --> 05:58.527
Is it ethical, is it not--

05:58.562 --> 05:59.974
And the boston papers
picked it up,

06:00.009 --> 06:02.670
And suddenly i'm in the middle
of this controversy

06:02.705 --> 06:04.134
That harvard wants no part of,

06:04.169 --> 06:06.410
So they rescind
my offer of admission.

06:07.254 --> 06:09.685
Well, i believe taking
a controlled substance

06:09.720 --> 06:11.757
Without a prescription
actually is illegal.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.341
No, it's a study aid,

06:13.376 --> 06:15.866
Just one step above
potent coffee.

06:17.357 --> 06:19.088
So what would you
like us to do?

06:20.408 --> 06:22.703
Get me reinstated
at harvard.

06:23.199 --> 06:24.990
I didn't do anything
to deserve this.

06:25.025 --> 06:26.311
I mean,
they're singling me out,

06:26.346 --> 06:27.779
And now
no school will take me.

06:27.814 --> 06:30.386
Where are your parents
with all this?

06:30.421 --> 06:32.441
Beyond devastated.

06:33.005 --> 06:35.777
It was their dream to see
their little girl go to harvard.

06:39.092 --> 06:40.935
I have to fix this.

06:40.970 --> 06:43.287
I screwed it up...

06:44.119 --> 06:47.421
and i have to fix this.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.828
What are you doing
at my desk?

06:57.043 --> 06:59.847
Oh. Oh. I-I was just
straightening up.

07:00.226 --> 07:01.942
That's what assistants do.

07:01.977 --> 07:03.607
You're not my assistant.

07:03.642 --> 07:04.666
Yes, i am, dear.

07:04.701 --> 07:08.080
No, i have an as--
Where is she?

07:08.115 --> 07:09.775
-Oh, francine?
-Mm.

07:09.810 --> 07:11.250
-I fired her.
-You--

07:11.285 --> 07:13.873
Too pretty, too young--
She's a distraction.

07:13.908 --> 07:15.192
All right,
i'm calling security.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.702
Look, honey, you sure
you want to make trouble

07:17.737 --> 07:19.228
For shirley's sister?

07:19.263 --> 07:21.309
-I mean, after all--
-Your name is catherine piper.

07:21.344 --> 07:24.976
You were fired for, among
other things, being psychotic.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.412
I also have cancer, dear.

07:31.157 --> 07:33.331
There. It's out.

07:33.510 --> 07:36.120
I am desperate
for a distraction,

07:36.155 --> 07:39.002
Anything to occupy myself
while...

07:39.543 --> 07:43.265
I'm sorry. I didn't come here
to indulge...

07:43.300 --> 07:44.928
you have cancer?

07:45.107 --> 07:47.581
Not really, but i could
get some if you'd like.

07:47.616 --> 07:49.391
Oh, 9-1-1.

07:49.426 --> 07:52.346
Look, if i could just
work here on a temporary--

07:53.406 --> 07:55.029
Oh, sorry.
(The practice's themed music)

07:56.460 --> 07:58.427
9-1-1.

07:58.462 --> 08:00.862
What's the emergency?

08:01.928 --> 08:03.516
How did...

08:10.069 --> 08:12.364
i'm afraid they said no.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.003
But...

08:14.386 --> 08:15.797
did you point out

08:15.832 --> 08:18.380
I didn't actually violate
any policy or--

08:18.415 --> 08:20.892
They're citing honesty,
moral character.

08:20.927 --> 08:23.803
Uh, everybody's doing it.

08:23.838 --> 08:26.631
-I realize that, but--
-But you went public, margie.

08:26.666 --> 08:27.825
We can take it to court,

08:27.860 --> 08:30.068
But i wouldn't expect
to be successful.

08:30.103 --> 08:32.986
Oh, we--We have to try.

08:33.022 --> 08:35.410
I have geared my whole life
toward going to harvard.

08:35.446 --> 08:36.672
I just...

08:38.376 --> 08:40.792
i need to try.

08:42.062 --> 08:43.431
Please.

08:44.779 --> 08:46.016
I don't know, jerry.

08:46.051 --> 08:47.736
You say she didn't have
a prescription.

08:47.771 --> 08:48.976
All the kids
are doing this, alan--

08:49.011 --> 08:50.434
Geing it
without prescriptions.

08:50.469 --> 08:52.206
Well, that's not much
of an argument.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.166
You could argue that rescinding
her admission is arbitrary

08:55.201 --> 08:57.945
Since they have
no official policy.

08:58.382 --> 09:01.204
Oh, alan.
Um, hey, jerry.

09:01.239 --> 09:03.795
Alan, there's a drug--

09:03.830 --> 09:06.066
It's called, uh, dimebolin,
something like that--

09:06.101 --> 09:08.842
And i want it.
My doctor won't give it to me.

09:08.877 --> 09:11.036
It's from russia.
It stems off alzheimer's.

09:11.071 --> 09:12.876
Denny, slow down.
I can't at the moment.

09:12.911 --> 09:14.030
I've taken
a little too much adderall.

09:14.065 --> 09:15.119
Adderall?

09:15.154 --> 09:17.373
See? That's what margie takes,
that and ritalin.

09:17.408 --> 09:18.454
Ritalin. I love ritalin.

09:18.489 --> 09:21.276
Denny, what did we agree on
regarding your medicines?

09:21.311 --> 09:22.891
I would be in charge.

09:22.926 --> 09:25.023
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but i'm
the one with the alzheimer's.

09:25.058 --> 09:28.007
I'll take what i want,
and right now, i want dimebolin.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.098
And you've gotta
help me get it.

09:41.256 --> 09:42.840
You okay, jerry?

09:44.171 --> 09:45.573
Academic doping...

09:45.608 --> 09:47.671
it has such a stigma to it.

09:48.067 --> 09:51.414
What about emotional doping?

09:51.449 --> 09:52.857
What do you mean?

09:54.269 --> 09:56.529
That's what i do--
Emotional doping.

09:56.564 --> 09:59.185
I take
my little helpers to...

10:00.452 --> 10:02.599
do you think
it reflects poorly

10:02.634 --> 10:04.294
On my moral character?

10:04.295 --> 10:04.991
No.

10:05.026 --> 10:06.565
What's the difference?

10:06.600 --> 10:09.005
Well, your medication
is prescribed for one thing.

10:09.040 --> 10:09.682
Mostly.

10:09.717 --> 10:13.697
And second, you have a specific,
diagnosed condition, jerry--

10:13.732 --> 10:14.945
Asperger's syndrome.

10:14.980 --> 10:17.865
Three years ago, you couldn't
even make eye contact.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.720
I take pills
that affect my brain

10:19.755 --> 10:21.786
To help me perform better.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.115
Jerry,
i'm the first one to say

10:24.150 --> 10:25.922
We have
an overmedicated society.

10:25.957 --> 10:28.339
We've got 3 year olds
on antipsychotics.

10:28.374 --> 10:31.179
People who don't even have
high cholesterol take statins.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.654
People take sleep aids
when maybe they should just

10:33.689 --> 10:35.215
Read a book or masturbate.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.398
I-It's out of control.

10:36.433 --> 10:39.975
But that's not to say that many
drugs don't do a lot of good.

10:40.010 --> 10:41.415
They save lives.

10:41.450 --> 10:45.389
People need drugs like insulin
or blood pressure medicine

10:45.424 --> 10:46.936
To simply
maintain their health.

10:46.971 --> 10:51.959
And drugs help some people
to live normal, productive lives

10:51.994 --> 10:53.703
Who might otherwise not.

10:53.738 --> 10:56.397
You fall into that category.

10:56.432 --> 10:58.546
Popping pills to...

10:58.698 --> 11:00.131
Get better s.A.T. Scores--

11:00.166 --> 11:04.372
That's...
something different.

11:37.286 --> 11:39.458
You are not working here,
catherine.

11:39.493 --> 11:41.057
That much has been decided.

11:41.092 --> 11:44.136
Well, then what are
we doing in your office,

11:44.171 --> 11:45.840
Behind closed doors...

11:45.875 --> 11:48.815
where you could
sexually ravage me

11:48.850 --> 11:51.342
With no witnesses
to say it didn't happen?

11:52.085 --> 11:54.784
We're here because i'm told
you're a friend of alan's.

11:55.122 --> 11:57.438
And as a courtesy to him
and you,

11:57.473 --> 11:58.778
I thought
i would at least give you

11:58.813 --> 12:03.321
An opportunity to explain
why you're doing this.

12:04.276 --> 12:06.622
I'm doing it because i'm old

12:06.657 --> 12:09.030
And i'm bored.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.439
All my friends are dead.

12:12.474 --> 12:14.487
It's not like
i could go skiing

12:14.522 --> 12:17.067
Or--Or mountain climbing or...

12:17.422 --> 12:22.232
honestly, a-Assuming i were
qualified to be your assistant,

12:22.267 --> 12:25.891
Uh, would you
employ somebody my age?

12:26.857 --> 12:27.934
Probably not.

12:27.969 --> 12:30.028
I didn't think so.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.730
I got that on tape, dear.

12:33.765 --> 12:36.720
Now i can e you
for age discrimination.

12:36.755 --> 12:40.458
Best you keep me on,
avoid the controversy.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.841
Get out, catherine.

12:54.959 --> 12:57.150
I didn't cheat.
I took medicine

12:57.185 --> 12:59.301
To help my brain function
at its highest level.

12:59.336 --> 13:02.232
You didn't have a prescription
for the medication.

13:02.267 --> 13:05.007
A dozen faculty members
at cambridge university

13:05.042 --> 13:07.095
Admit to taking
unprescribed adderall

13:07.130 --> 13:09.230
To improve their own
academic performance,

13:09.265 --> 13:11.410
But nobody's expelling them.

13:11.445 --> 13:14.068
They're claiming it shows
poor moral character.

13:14.103 --> 13:15.009
And i reject that.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.615
Helicopter pilots take prescription
stimulants to stay alert.

13:18.650 --> 13:20.906
Medical interns take
drugs for narcolepsy

13:20.941 --> 13:21.948
So that they can work all night.

13:21.983 --> 13:23.699
Should we indict
all of them as well?

13:23.734 --> 13:26.299
All they've done is use
a pharmacological tool

13:26.334 --> 13:28.951
So that they could do
their work more effectively.

13:29.328 --> 13:30.395
Certainly you're aware

13:30.430 --> 13:32.659
That harvard has
extremely high standards.

13:32.694 --> 13:33.402
Of course.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.820
John f. Kennedy was a graduate.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.186
As was the unabomber.

13:36.221 --> 13:38.585
-F.D.R.
-Hitler's foreign press secretary.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.401
Numerous literary figures--

13:40.436 --> 13:41.455
Emerson, thoreau--

13:41.490 --> 13:43.024
And the cardinal archbishop

13:43.059 --> 13:45.290
Who shielded child molesters
from prosecution.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.036
For faculty,

13:46.071 --> 13:48.471
You had timothy leary
and his l.S.D. Experiments--

13:48.506 --> 13:51.677
Ms. Coggins, do you want
to go to harvard or not?

13:53.324 --> 13:54.732
Yeah, i do...

13:56.587 --> 13:57.870
desperately.

13:57.905 --> 14:01.725
My point is...
harvard's not perfect,

14:01.760 --> 14:03.352
But neither am i.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.401
But at every opportunity,

14:05.436 --> 14:09.251
I endeavor to be the best
possible version of myself.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.981
And that's all i was doing
by taking ritalin.

14:21.144 --> 14:22.891
The early trials
have been encouraging.

14:22.926 --> 14:24.892
It's in
the stage 3 trials now.

14:24.927 --> 14:25.704
I want it.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.672
Well, you can't have it.

14:27.707 --> 14:28.323
Why not?

14:28.358 --> 14:29.882
Because it's not
f.D.A. Approved.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.425
-This drug is a long way--
-I don't care.

14:31.460 --> 14:35.313
Mr. Crane, i'm not allowed
to prescribe this medication.

14:35.348 --> 14:37.499
And even if i were and did,
you still couldn't get it

14:37.534 --> 14:38.528
-Since it hasn't been--
-How long before

14:38.563 --> 14:41.067
It's available to the public?

14:41.471 --> 14:43.846
My guess is at least two years,
probably three.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.832
-The f.D.A. Hasn't even analyzed
-I-I'll--I'll be dead

14:45.867 --> 14:47.440
-The data of the trials--
-In three years.

14:47.475 --> 14:48.567
Where's the drug?
Who's got it?

14:48.602 --> 14:50.428
Well, pfizer just bought
the rights,

14:50.463 --> 14:53.673
But nobody can just say,
"okay, i'll give it to you."

14:53.708 --> 14:55.160
It would be illegal to do so

14:55.195 --> 14:57.344
Unless you get yourself
enrolled in a clinical trial,

14:57.379 --> 14:59.060
But i think it's fully booked.

15:02.534 --> 15:03.484
Let's be fair.

15:03.489 --> 15:06.914
It's not just the s.A.T.
That gets a person admitted.

15:06.949 --> 15:07.757
Of course not.

15:07.792 --> 15:10.744
Margie, in fact, is also
a national merit finalist,

15:10.779 --> 15:13.999
Captain of her swim team,
class valedictorian.

15:14.034 --> 15:15.229
We get applications

15:15.264 --> 15:17.478
From thousands
of national merit finalists,

15:17.513 --> 15:20.564
Thousands of captains
and thousands of valedictorians.

15:20.599 --> 15:21.948
But this one,
you offered admission.

15:21.983 --> 15:25.476
Yes, until she admitted she had
used brain enhancent drugs.

15:25.511 --> 15:28.027
As do thousands
of other students.

15:28.062 --> 15:29.486
Do you have a way
to weed all of them

15:29.521 --> 15:30.574
Out of your applicant pool?

15:31.141 --> 15:31.901
No.

15:31.936 --> 15:34.684
And there's actually
no policy at harvard

15:34.719 --> 15:38.219
Explicitly forbidding
what you term "academic doping,"

15:38.254 --> 15:39.907
-Is there?
-I think in future--

15:39.942 --> 15:42.611
So you intend to enforce
future rules against her.

15:42.646 --> 15:44.420
Do you think that's fair?

15:44.550 --> 15:46.893
We consider her actions
to be immoral,

15:46.928 --> 15:47.927
And we reserve our right

15:47.962 --> 15:50.411
To make our admissions decisions
accordingly.

15:56.598 --> 15:59.637
I've decided not to sue you.

15:59.672 --> 16:00.661
How sweet.

16:01.163 --> 16:02.172
Listen,

16:02.207 --> 16:05.143
Th-That part about me being desperate
for a distraction,

16:05.178 --> 16:06.671
That was true.

16:06.706 --> 16:08.662
It isn't fair, carl.

16:08.697 --> 16:10.156
I have my health

16:10.191 --> 16:13.505
A-And my mind
is as sharp as--As...

16:14.786 --> 16:17.177
well, you people come up
with all this medicine

16:17.212 --> 16:19.905
To--To--To keep us alive,

16:19.940 --> 16:20.920
Even thrive,

16:20.955 --> 16:22.993
And you don't know
what to do with us.

16:23.028 --> 16:27.337
I was thinking...
if i were to come up

16:27.372 --> 16:29.679
With something
i could sue for,

16:29.714 --> 16:30.817
Something legitimate,

16:30.852 --> 16:32.837
And it could
make the firm money--

16:35.155 --> 16:36.370
Uh... i suppose

16:36.405 --> 16:40.081
If you had
a legitimate cause of action,

16:40.116 --> 16:41.349
Then we would--

16:43.184 --> 16:44.552
Drugs.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.786
Uh, okay, they make them
too expensive,

16:46.821 --> 16:48.650
-While in canada, you can--
-No.

16:49.779 --> 16:50.850
Inflation.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.561
Uh, our social security
payments

16:53.596 --> 16:55.207
-Don't keep pace--
-No.

16:56.778 --> 17:01.521
Oh. Look, some jobs still have
a mandatory retirement age.

17:01.556 --> 17:02.865
No.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.464
These are all legitimate.

17:05.499 --> 17:08.863
Catherine,
you have to have standing.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.962
It has to
directly impact you,

17:11.997 --> 17:14.137
Harm you.

17:15.026 --> 17:16.843
Look how insensitive
you're being.

17:16.877 --> 17:19.017
Th-This is exactly
the problem.

17:19.051 --> 17:21.416
We're just shoved aside
as a nuisance.

17:21.452 --> 17:25.029
I can't even watch
television shows, for god sake,

17:25.064 --> 17:27.996
Because the networks
consider me irrelevant.

17:28.031 --> 17:31.316
You'd think they don't program
for anybody over 50.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.591
Is it any wonder

17:32.626 --> 17:35.482
I'm out knocking over
convenience stores?

17:36.193 --> 17:39.501
You actually
may have something there.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.462
The networks--

17:40.497 --> 17:44.013
They're supposed
to serve the public.

17:46.474 --> 17:48.418
Okay, catherine...

17:48.453 --> 17:50.369
we'll take that case.

17:51.017 --> 17:52.376
Really?

17:52.411 --> 17:54.164
I'm over 50 myself...

17:54.771 --> 17:57.966
and i want something to watch.

18:08.038 --> 18:09.107
How we doing?

18:09.142 --> 18:10.642
Fine.

18:14.573 --> 18:16.865
I got a hearing
before judge peyton tomorrow.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.596
We'll take our best shot.

18:21.830 --> 18:25.007
Shirley's at the fat farm.
You hear?

18:25.042 --> 18:27.062
Why? She's not fat.

18:27.097 --> 18:27.888
You know brides.

18:27.893 --> 18:32.302
They like to get all skinny
before the wedding.

18:32.337 --> 18:35.174
It's all about
how they look in their dress.

18:40.099 --> 18:47.011
You know the best part
of having, uh... mad cow?

18:47.046 --> 18:49.290
Sometimes...

18:49.325 --> 18:50.657
not often...

18:53.112 --> 18:55.360
i think
we're still together.

18:58.263 --> 19:02.462
As delusions go,
it's one of the better ones.

19:11.932 --> 19:14.745
You gonna be okay, denny,
attending her wedding?

19:17.746 --> 19:19.907
Yeah. Well...

19:20.553 --> 19:22.275
what i'm not okay with is...

19:22.310 --> 19:24.445
sitting on my ass
while my brain rots.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.728
I have a big problem
with that, though.

19:28.624 --> 19:31.235
We go before judge peyton
in the morning.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.493
Yeah, you told me.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.963
You gonna stay here
all night, jerry?

19:49.998 --> 19:50.758
It's not even clear

19:50.793 --> 19:52.802
Those drugs gave her
all that much of an advantage.

19:52.837 --> 19:55.397
She scored 99th percentile
on the practice test,

19:55.432 --> 19:56.590
Which she took
without the drugs.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.533
Jerry, she cheated.
Let's not kid ourselves.

19:58.568 --> 19:59.607
Most kids
get a bigger advantage

19:59.642 --> 20:00.818
By taking
the s.A.T. Prep program.

20:00.853 --> 20:03.748
They actually can boost scores
by 150 points.

20:03.783 --> 20:05.198
Those programs are legitimate.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.786
And not affordable
to kids like margie.

20:06.821 --> 20:07.704
Let's face it, katie.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.882
The rich have such a leg up
in this college racket.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.029
According to one chancellor,
in ivy league schools,

20:12.064 --> 20:15.804
Poor applicants really only
get a shot at 40% of the slots.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.202
The rest are reserved
for families of privilege.

20:18.337 --> 20:21.565
But jerry, you cannot be
a fan of academic doping.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.705
I'm just saying...

20:24.967 --> 20:27.398
life isn't
an even playing field,

20:27.433 --> 20:31.162
And for those who are...

20:31.197 --> 20:33.068
weaker than...

20:33.794 --> 20:35.171
meaning you?

20:36.092 --> 20:39.766
Jerry, you're not weaker than.
You have asperger's.

20:40.421 --> 20:43.056
You have no idea
how afraid i am

20:43.091 --> 20:45.224
To leave my apartment.

20:45.563 --> 20:47.090
Every day...

20:47.125 --> 20:48.996
every morning,

20:49.031 --> 20:53.462
I actually wonder, will i
get out the door or not?

20:53.497 --> 20:55.926
It seems you win
that battle every day.

20:56.482 --> 21:00.197
Yeah... on drugs.

21:07.438 --> 21:10.298
You can't sue the networks.

21:10.333 --> 21:13.353
The airwaves, judge, are
a public trust, at least as far

21:13.388 --> 21:15.052
As the broadcast networks
are concerned.

21:15.087 --> 21:17.203
-That's why they're regulated.
-It's still a business.

21:17.238 --> 21:19.498
I mean, bungee jumping
might be regulated.

21:19.533 --> 21:20.624
Are you saying
that those outfits

21:20.659 --> 21:22.224
Would have a duty
to service the elderly?

21:22.259 --> 21:24.162
No, that would be unreasonable.

21:24.197 --> 21:27.436
But to require a broadcaster
to program for everybody isn't.

21:27.471 --> 21:29.214
Mr. Suck.

21:29.249 --> 21:30.166
Sack.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.527
Your honor,
there may have been a time

21:31.562 --> 21:34.234
When it made practical business
sense to exclude the old,

21:34.269 --> 21:34.788
But not today.

21:34.823 --> 21:37.214
Americans over 50 make up
the fastest growing market.

21:37.249 --> 21:38.500
It's about money,
not how many--

21:38.535 --> 21:41.742
Really? Gee. I would've
never guessed that.

21:41.777 --> 21:44.139
The baby boomers,
now all over 50,

21:44.174 --> 21:46.446
Earn $2 trillion
in annual income.

21:46.481 --> 21:47.834
<i>That's trillion.
</i>

21:47.835 --> 21:50.569
Madison avenue is after
the discretionary spender.

21:50.604 --> 21:54.001
Yes, and people over 50
account for half of that, too.

21:54.036 --> 21:56.648
Choose your statistic.
Go ahead. I've got you.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.593
We've got more money.
We spend more money.

21:59.628 --> 22:01.568
We watch more television,
go to more movies.

22:01.603 --> 22:04.280
We buy more cds
than young people do,

22:04.315 --> 22:08.167
And yet we're the focus of less
than 10% of the advertising.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.782
All the networks want to do
is skew younger.

22:10.817 --> 22:12.159
Kid shows for kids.

22:12.194 --> 22:17.033
You know, the only show
unafraid to have its stars over 50 is "b"--

22:18.062 --> 22:20.689
Gee, i can't say it.
It would, um, break the wall.

22:20.724 --> 22:23.057
Oh, mr. Suck.
It's still sack.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.808
I can't tell the networks
what shows to make.

22:25.843 --> 22:28.486
No, but yocan order them
not to discriminate.

22:28.521 --> 22:32.654
What they're doing intentionally
excludes a class of society.

22:32.689 --> 22:33.998
That's bigotry.

22:34.033 --> 22:36.669
You know, we should be able to
turn on our damn televisions

22:36.704 --> 22:37.423
And see something

22:37.458 --> 22:41.059
Other than reality shows
aimed at fourth graders,

22:41.094 --> 22:42.510
Games shows aimed at those

22:42.545 --> 22:44.935
Slightly smarter
than fifth graders

22:44.970 --> 22:46.257
And scripted shows

22:46.292 --> 22:49.394
With dim-Witted,
sex-Crazed 20-Somethings

22:49.429 --> 22:52.156
Running around in suits
or doctor scrubs.

22:52.191 --> 22:53.828
Old people,
the ones with intelligence,

22:53.863 --> 22:56.388
Don't want to watch that crap.
We're fed up!

22:56.423 --> 22:59.562
You know, the networks might
think we're dead, but we're not.

22:59.597 --> 23:02.817
We're very much alive
with working brains.

23:02.852 --> 23:06.591
Give us something to watch,
damn it!

23:13.624 --> 23:14.841
You ready, denny?

23:20.038 --> 23:21.254
Denny?

23:28.834 --> 23:30.098
What's wrong?

23:30.734 --> 23:32.353
I must have nodded off.

23:33.356 --> 23:34.657
I was...

23:36.064 --> 23:38.752
dreaming about shirley.

23:39.636 --> 23:41.535
We were on a bench.

23:41.979 --> 23:44.658
<i>She asked me to marry her.</i>

23:47.116 --> 23:48.779
What a dream.

23:53.412 --> 23:56.544
Were my eyes closed
when you came in?

23:57.756 --> 23:58.723
Yeah.

24:02.063 --> 24:04.287
You must have nodded off.

24:06.341 --> 24:06.879
You ready?

24:06.914 --> 24:08.982
We're due in court.

24:24.123 --> 24:27.615
Mr.Shore, the supreme court
already ruled on this very issue.

24:27.650 --> 24:28.966
No, they didn't, judge.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.373
The supreme court, in fact,
refused to rule on it.

24:31.408 --> 24:33.205
They couldn't be bothered
to even hear the case.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.038
I'm sure if one of
their friends were dying,

24:35.073 --> 24:36.311
We would've had
a different result.

24:36.346 --> 24:36.902
Oh, come on.

24:36.937 --> 24:40.872
Why can't mr. Crane
take the drug and simply assume

24:40.907 --> 24:43.007
All the inherent risks
if he so chooses?

24:43.042 --> 24:44.583
Because we don't
let people take drugs

24:44.618 --> 24:46.854
While they're still
in the investigative stage,

24:46.889 --> 24:47.901
And with good reason.

24:47.936 --> 24:49.853
Think of
the potential for abuse.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.112
Potential for abuse?

24:52.147 --> 24:53.896
What's the downside?
He could die?

24:53.931 --> 24:55.207
He's doing that anyway.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.331
No, he isn't. He could live

24:56.332 --> 24:58.689
-A long time with alzheimer's.
-Which could be worse.

24:58.724 --> 25:00.914
And it's possible the disease
could take years to progress.

25:00.949 --> 25:02.828
He could have many
healthy years while we--

25:02.863 --> 25:05.882
There are all kinds
of possibilities and choices.

25:05.917 --> 25:08.825
Why can't they belong
to the patient?

25:08.860 --> 25:09.864
There is still so much

25:09.899 --> 25:11.935
That is still so unknown
about dimebolin that--

25:11.970 --> 25:13.681
Yes, and we'll assume
all of the risks.

25:13.682 --> 25:15.566
-Do i ever get to speak?
-I'd prefer you didn't.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.986
-We're wasting precious time.
-Mr. Shore,

25:17.144 --> 25:19.416
I  am a superior court judge.

25:19.451 --> 25:22.703
I have to take my cues
from the appellate court.

25:22.738 --> 25:24.990
On this issue,
the law is clear.

25:25.025 --> 25:28.314
A patient,
even a dying patient,

25:28.349 --> 25:31.576
Has no constitutional right
to experimental treatment.

25:31.611 --> 25:34.745
Now do i agree with that
precedent? No, not really.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.269
So this is what i will do--

25:36.664 --> 25:39.385
I'll certify it to the
massachusetts supreme court.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.076
Maybe they can find
the authority

25:41.111 --> 25:42.655
To give you what you want.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.903
We are adjourned.

25:49.944 --> 25:51.404
So now what?

25:52.340 --> 25:54.251
We go to
the state supreme court.

25:54.940 --> 25:55.752
There's nine of them.

25:55.787 --> 25:57.321
Let's hope that at least one
has a relative

25:57.356 --> 25:59.585
Who has an incurable disease.

26:09.924 --> 26:13.040
When was the last time
a pretty lady sat ne to you

26:13.075 --> 26:14.949
And sucked on your ear lobe?

26:15.369 --> 26:17.956
And don't count
the number of times

26:17.991 --> 26:20.104
You had to pay for it.

26:20.584 --> 26:21.996
How dare you?

26:22.031 --> 26:23.922
I'm eating my lunch.

26:23.957 --> 26:27.586
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
Throw an old lady a bone.

26:27.621 --> 26:29.464
You are....

26:29.499 --> 26:31.809
a shocking woman!

26:31.844 --> 26:35.623
Look, judge, i know
this is--Is ex parte

26:35.658 --> 26:37.359
Or some--Whatever, uh, uh,

26:37.394 --> 26:41.220
Some latin term that means
i can't gum your body parts.

26:41.255 --> 26:45.579
But why don't you just give me
something good to watch on tv?

26:45.614 --> 26:48.788
I mean, the airwaves are
a public trust. Am i right?

26:48.823 --> 26:50.475
Uh, catherine,
what are you doing?

26:50.510 --> 26:53.125
She's trying
to suck on my ear.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.404
That's what she's doing.

26:54.439 --> 26:56.341
-Outrageous!
-Catherine,

26:56.444 --> 26:57.494
Go inside the courthouse.

26:57.529 --> 26:59.925
I'll meet you there. Now.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.158
Ahem. I apologize, judge.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.286
You ask me,

27:11.321 --> 27:13.407
Your client already watches
too much television.

27:13.442 --> 27:15.893
-Ah.
-And that smutty mouth.

27:15.928 --> 27:17.947
Sex, sex, sex, sex.

27:17.982 --> 27:19.065
That what you watch?

27:19.100 --> 27:21.259
Silence!

27:21.294 --> 27:23.510
Uh, well,
you know, judge,

27:23.545 --> 27:26.187
In addition to there being
little for us to watch,

27:26.222 --> 27:28.451
Most of it stinks,

27:28.954 --> 27:30.882
And it's partly
this thing's fault.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.194
What are you talking about?

27:32.229 --> 27:34.433
Well, a lot of people are on it
while they're watching.

27:34.468 --> 27:37.179
They no longer give television
their undivided attention.

27:37.214 --> 27:38.259
We're either on the phone

27:38.294 --> 27:41.723
Or we're texting
or on the internet.

27:41.758 --> 27:44.394
So the producers,
they dumb down the plots,

27:44.429 --> 27:49.011
Make it easier to keep up with
while their viewers multitask.

27:49.046 --> 27:49.718
Really?

27:50.171 --> 27:53.471
Kids nowadays watch an average
of three hours of television a day.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.081
That's while being distracted.

27:55.116 --> 27:58.069
People over 55,
we watch 6 hours a day.

27:58.104 --> 28:00.655
And we really watch.

28:00.690 --> 28:02.750
So why aren't they
programming for us?

28:02.785 --> 28:05.151
You know, come on,
do these idiots a favor, judge.

28:05.449 --> 28:08.605
Send these network bozos
a clue. Be a leader.

28:08.785 --> 28:10.860
And we can't wait
for congress after all,

28:11.429 --> 28:14.591
Because, well,
they're bozos, too.

28:23.053 --> 28:25.863
These are their minds
they're messing with.

28:25.898 --> 28:28.215
We don't even know
the long-Term damage.

28:28.250 --> 28:29.104
Now obviously,

28:29.139 --> 28:32.014
Short of requiring
urinalysis at the s.A.T.S,

28:32.049 --> 28:34.565
We can't monitor who is
or isn't using,

28:34.600 --> 28:37.143
But we can take a stand
against the ones

28:37.178 --> 28:38.613
Who are brazen about it,

28:38.648 --> 28:41.685
Who defend it
as acceptable and fair.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.421
Simply put,
what margie coggins did

28:44.456 --> 28:46.379
Was decidedly unfair.

28:46.414 --> 28:48.171
It's cheating.

28:48.883 --> 28:51.726
Not in keeping with the ideals
of harvard.

28:52.889 --> 28:54.337
I got into harvard.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.081
Most don't.

28:56.116 --> 28:58.291
Harvard rejects
over 90% of its applicants.

28:58.326 --> 29:01.330
That's 90% of
the best high school students.

29:01.365 --> 29:04.609
The rest don't even
bother applying.

29:04.644 --> 29:05.840
The problem is,

29:05.875 --> 29:09.208
Every parent wants their kid
to go to harvard.

29:09.243 --> 29:11.949
Parents push, nudge.
Some kick.

29:12.128 --> 29:14.273
Look at the climate
we've created.

29:14.558 --> 29:16.385
80% of honors

29:16.420 --> 29:18.204
And advance-Placement
students cheat,

29:18.239 --> 29:21.682
Not once or twice,
but on a regular basis.

29:21.717 --> 29:23.004
She didn't.

29:23.005 --> 29:24.804
She didn't get
the test answers ahead of time.

29:24.839 --> 29:26.331
She didn't copy
her neighbor's paper.

29:26.366 --> 29:28.229
She used her own brain.

29:28.264 --> 29:32.508
Yes, she used a prescription stimulant
to stay focused and alert.

29:32.543 --> 29:36.659
At least 30% of college students
admit to doing the same thing.

29:36.694 --> 29:38.877
Not only are there currently
no laws against it,

29:38.912 --> 29:40.779
There are currently no rules.

29:40.814 --> 29:44.131
These kids grow up
in a pervasive drug culture.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.643
We've got medications
not just to treat diseases,

29:46.678 --> 29:48.726
But simply to help you
do things better,

29:48.761 --> 29:50.837
Be it sex, urinating, digesting.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.796
We've got some to boost energy,
others to help you sleep.

29:53.831 --> 29:54.707
Better life,

29:54.742 --> 29:57.495
More productive life
through chemistry.

29:58.873 --> 30:00.083
The drug
we're talking about here

30:00.118 --> 30:03.922
Is used off label by many
to boost brain power.

30:03.957 --> 30:05.548
Personally...

30:05.583 --> 30:09.683
i've tried medication
to help with my asperger's.

30:09.718 --> 30:11.218
Some worked.

30:11.253 --> 30:14.931
They made me
feel safer emotionally.

30:16.019 --> 30:17.794
Should i not get that right?

30:17.829 --> 30:22.269
Or are drugs for emotions okay,
but cognition, no?

30:22.304 --> 30:24.725
Or should the rule be
for disorder, yes,

30:24.760 --> 30:26.829
But enhancement, no?

30:26.864 --> 30:28.498
Where do you draw that line?

30:28.533 --> 30:30.844
She didn't have a prescription
for the ones she took.

30:30.879 --> 30:33.140
True, but many kids do this.
She's no different.

30:33.175 --> 30:35.207
-Except she got caught.
-She didn't get caught.

30:35.242 --> 30:36.854
She was simply honest about it.

30:36.889 --> 30:38.697
Honesty--That's the infraction

30:38.732 --> 30:41.400
That's getting her bounced
on moral character grounds.

30:41.435 --> 30:44.324
Hypocrisy might be
a better word.

31:21.095 --> 31:22.519
What are you doing?

31:23.798 --> 31:25.328
I'm giving the bride away,
remember?

31:25.363 --> 31:27.891
-Oh.
-I'm practicing.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.072
I want to get it right.

31:34.079 --> 31:36.086
And she's gonna make
a magnificent bride...

31:37.413 --> 31:38.931
for the seventh time.

31:38.966 --> 31:40.114
Yeah.

31:43.466 --> 31:44.833
Need something?

31:46.958 --> 31:49.169
Denny, the massachusetts
supreme court,

31:49.204 --> 31:50.744
They said no.

31:51.526 --> 31:53.574
Oh, jeez.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.194
Any appeal?

31:56.229 --> 31:58.074
Well,
to the u.S. Supreme court,

31:58.109 --> 32:01.835
But they've already refused to
hear this very argument, so...

32:02.614 --> 32:03.511
so now what?

32:03.546 --> 32:05.054
I'm not sure.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.485
We can try to get you
into the clinical trials.

32:09.178 --> 32:11.287
-We could go to russia.
-We could.

32:11.322 --> 32:12.566
Or we could go to atlanta.

32:12.601 --> 32:15.193
I hear the russians have
kinda taken over georgia,

32:15.228 --> 32:18.168
-So we could go to atlanta.
-It's another georgia

32:18.203 --> 32:19.330
That the russians
have gotten involved with--

32:19.365 --> 32:20.578
Then we'll go
to the real russia.

32:20.613 --> 32:23.250
They got
magnificent salmon streams

32:23.285 --> 32:25.212
And no fish farms.

32:26.247 --> 32:27.398
What a road trip.

32:27.433 --> 32:31.332
Can you imagine you and me
on the loose in russia?

32:31.367 --> 32:33.775
That would be something.
Go fly-Fishing with putin.

32:33.810 --> 32:35.754
Look him in the eye,
see his soul.

32:35.789 --> 32:40.449
Tell him to keep his big, ugly head
out of alaskan airspace.

32:43.622 --> 32:45.258
Right after the wedding.

32:46.145 --> 32:47.785
Off to russia.

33:00.764 --> 33:01.750
All right.

33:01.785 --> 33:04.924
I can't solve
the brain enhancement debate

33:04.959 --> 33:06.708
With one ruling.

33:06.743 --> 33:08.132
But in this case,

33:08.167 --> 33:09.948
The plaintiff
didn't have a prescription.

33:09.983 --> 33:12.035
What she did was illegal.

33:12.534 --> 33:15.098
I am not ordering harvard
to reinstate her.

33:15.133 --> 33:17.137
We're adjourned.

33:20.152 --> 33:21.547
Wh-What do i do now?

33:28.470 --> 33:29.593
What's this?

33:30.508 --> 33:34.103
Well... this...

33:34.138 --> 33:37.189
would be...
a-A lecture, i guess.

33:38.214 --> 33:40.701
You said you geared
your whole life

33:40.736 --> 33:42.437
Toward getting into harvard.

33:42.472 --> 33:45.276
And now you think
it's the end of the world

33:45.311 --> 33:46.707
That...

33:47.611 --> 33:51.954
it's this very uber-Super-Comepititive
mentality that caused you

33:51.989 --> 33:54.121
To take the pills in
the first place, margie, and--

33:54.156 --> 33:55.876
Mr. Espenson,
you did get into harvard.

33:55.911 --> 33:57.165
And it changed nothing.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.894
I still popped,
purred, hopped.

33:59.929 --> 34:02.629
I was still ridiculed.
Harvard didn't change it.

34:02.664 --> 34:05.668
But i was so sure
law school would,

34:05.703 --> 34:07.260
Because everybody
respects lawyers.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.252
So i studied, studied,
made top of my class.

34:10.514 --> 34:11.545
It changed nothing.

34:11.580 --> 34:14.033
But i was positive
making partner would.

34:15.197 --> 34:17.320
Well... guess what.

34:18.635 --> 34:21.503
None of it
can give you self-Acceptance.

34:21.538 --> 34:23.196
For that, you need--

34:23.231 --> 34:24.120
A different ug?

34:24.155 --> 34:26.601
Exactly. And--No. No!

34:26.636 --> 34:30.870
For self-Acceptance, you need to go
to a far deeper, perhaps darker,

34:30.905 --> 34:33.331
Certainly scarier place.

34:33.994 --> 34:37.382
Your problem, margie,
is your priorities.

34:37.418 --> 34:40.353
Harvard isn't going to give you
what's most important in life.

34:40.652 --> 34:41.703
Trust me.

34:54.870 --> 34:57.248
At first, i thought this case
was like every other case

34:57.283 --> 34:59.712
Brought by this...
ridiculous law firm--

34:59.747 --> 35:02.375
Ridiculous and outrageous.

35:02.410 --> 35:03.892
But i can't ignore,

35:03.927 --> 35:09.895
Ageism is one of the last
socially condoned bigotries.

35:09.930 --> 35:14.400
And it is rampant in this
broadcast network business.

35:14.435 --> 35:18.479
They consider those of us
over 50 to be irrelevant.

35:18.514 --> 35:19.279
How is it possible

35:19.314 --> 35:21.878
That we are not even
a part of the target demo

35:21.913 --> 35:24.054
When we watch
the most television

35:24.089 --> 35:26.510
And spend the most money?

35:26.545 --> 35:28.710
My god,
there are 87 million of us,

35:28.745 --> 35:33.389
And that number will grow
by 31 million more by 2020.

35:33.424 --> 35:36.189
Are you really telling me
that it doesn't make sense

35:36.224 --> 35:39.051
To make television shows
that we want to tch?

35:39.086 --> 35:40.368
If i am to assume

35:40.403 --> 35:43.279
That the industry is not run
by a bunch of idiots,

35:43.314 --> 35:46.955
Then i can only conclude that
it's dominated by prejudice.

35:47.782 --> 35:50.086
The case stands.

35:51.533 --> 35:53.228
Adjourned.

35:57.361 --> 36:00.082
Well, well, well.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.801
Congratulations, catherine.

36:02.101 --> 36:03.376
You know...

36:03.411 --> 36:07.572
old people have
active sex lives, too.

36:08.887 --> 36:11.374
My trailer or yours?

36:20.421 --> 36:22.030
* you are *

36:22.065 --> 36:25.614
* so beautiful *

36:27.241 --> 36:35.490
* to me *

36:36.230 --> 36:38.673
* you are *

36:38.708 --> 36:43.148
* so beautiful *

36:43.183 --> 36:48.646
* to me *

36:59.115 --> 37:00.179
Denny.

37:02.337 --> 37:03.669
Oh, hey...

37:03.982 --> 37:05.196
carl.

37:06.116 --> 37:08.323
Uh, i was, uh...

37:10.096 --> 37:11.770
just practicing.

37:13.073 --> 37:16.040
I-I want to
give her away right.

37:18.360 --> 37:19.723
Listen, i, um...

37:20.676 --> 37:23.690
i appreciate you being
such a...

37:25.470 --> 37:27.833
well, a great sport
about this.

37:27.868 --> 37:31.144
I know
that on some level, it--

37:31.179 --> 37:32.914
What?!
Oh, my jiminy christmas!

37:32.949 --> 37:35.417
Denny! Denny! We're goin' back!
We're goin' back!

37:35.452 --> 37:37.091
-We're goin' back!
-What are you talk--

37:37.126 --> 37:38.156
The case! The case!
The case!

37:38.191 --> 37:39.643
I just got off the phone
with the clerk's office.

37:39.678 --> 37:41.306
-The massachusetts--
-Slow down.

37:41.341 --> 37:44.001
-We're on our way!
-R-Russia?

37:44.036 --> 37:45.513
-Not russia.
-Atlanta?

37:45.548 --> 37:47.983
No, washington!
The massachusetts supreme court,

37:48.018 --> 37:48.967
On their own initiative,

37:49.002 --> 37:50.718
Petitioned
the u.S. Supreme court.

37:50.753 --> 37:52.287
This time,
they agreed to hear it.

37:52.617 --> 37:53.420
Hear what?

37:53.455 --> 37:54.796
-Our case!
-What?!

37:54.831 --> 37:56.978
-We're going back to the supreme court!
-When?

37:57.013 --> 37:58.330
-Next week.
-Next week?

37:58.365 --> 37:59.787
-Next week!
-Oh!

37:59.822 --> 38:03.329
Supreme court!
Supreme court! Supreme court!

38:03.364 --> 38:04.780
Sorry, carl.
Don't mean to exclude you.

38:04.815 --> 38:09.591
Supreme court! Supreme court!
Supreme court! Supreme court!

38:19.976 --> 38:21.264
Working late again?

38:22.211 --> 38:24.962
It's a myth the workload drops
when you make partner.

38:25.754 --> 38:27.897
Get out while you still can.

38:31.255 --> 38:32.876
Jerry,
can i say something?

38:35.406 --> 38:39.118
Your comment about you
being weaker than...

38:39.153 --> 38:41.780
i've been thinking about it,
and i disagree.

38:41.815 --> 38:43.620
I quite think you might be

38:43.655 --> 38:46.159
The bravest person
i've ever met.

38:47.234 --> 38:47.787
Why?

38:47.822 --> 38:51.228
Just the way you take on your
various challenges every day.

38:52.420 --> 38:54.867
There aren't many men
like you, jerry.

38:59.106 --> 39:00.253
Thanks.

39:04.784 --> 39:06.308
How about
we go for a drink?

39:06.832 --> 39:07.706
We had a good day.

39:07.711 --> 39:10.161
We actually lost, come to think
of it.All the more reason.

39:10.196 --> 39:13.628
-Shall we?
-As colleagues?

39:15.115 --> 39:17.374
Jerry,
let's go for a drink.

39:19.462 --> 39:21.598
I'll meet you
by the elevator?

39:45.928 --> 39:47.874
Do you think
the supreme court,

39:48.326 --> 39:50.546
When they agreed
to take this case,

39:50.581 --> 39:51.951
Knew it was us?

39:51.986 --> 39:53.458
I don't know.

39:54.821 --> 39:56.516
Maybe they want a rematch.

39:56.551 --> 40:00.173
Ha! You'll kick
their asses again.

40:00.194 --> 40:02.695
They'll have to
bring in more justices.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.685
I thinkn they're only
allowed the nine.

40:06.394 --> 40:09.761
Hey, maybe i'll retire
after this.

40:09.796 --> 40:11.809
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Well, what better way to go out?

40:11.844 --> 40:14.771
My last case--In front
of the supreme court.

40:16.810 --> 40:20.085
Now there's a finale, alan.
They should put it on tv.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.852
We'd get ratings.
If they promoted us,

40:21.887 --> 40:23.542
Of course, i think there's
a law against promoting us.

40:23.577 --> 40:25.301
Seems to be.

40:28.343 --> 40:31.530
What would you do if you
retired, denny, seriously?

40:33.253 --> 40:34.434
Fish.

40:34.770 --> 40:35.644
Every day?

40:35.679 --> 40:38.085
Not every day.
I'd have sex some days.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.783
Maybe i should invite
ruth bader ginsburg

40:41.818 --> 40:43.231
To come
to nimmo bay with me.

40:43.266 --> 40:44.462
What about me?

40:44.497 --> 40:47.161
You can borrow magazines
from clarence thomas.

40:49.841 --> 40:53.579
Oh, won't they be so happy
to see us again?

40:53.614 --> 40:55.333
-The rematch.
-The rematch.

40:55.368 --> 40:58.672
-Grand finale.
-Special 9:00 start time.

41:05.147 --> 41:08.253
I made
another decision today.

41:09.307 --> 41:10.477
Which is?

41:11.330 --> 41:12.709
I'm not dying.

41:13.706 --> 41:15.194
I like that idea.

41:15.229 --> 41:18.627
I'm gonna get my hands on
this drug one way or another.

41:18.662 --> 41:20.765
Hell, this is america.
If we have to, we'll--

41:20.800 --> 41:21.868
Bribe.

41:21.903 --> 41:22.989
Damn right.

41:23.457 --> 41:25.412
And even if i fail,

41:25.447 --> 41:28.044
They say if you keep
getting excited about life,

41:28.079 --> 41:30.310
The blood rushes
to your brain better.

41:32.701 --> 41:34.896
I'll love life, alan,

41:34.931 --> 41:36.531
Even if it kills me.

41:36.566 --> 41:39.490
I'll fish,
i'll be with you.

41:42.905 --> 41:45.517
<i>I'll love life, alan.</i>

41:47.773 --> 41:49.882
And next week,
i'll love life in washington

41:49.917 --> 41:50.993
In front
of the supreme court.

41:51.028 --> 41:54.282
And after that, i'll love it
in--In nimmo bay--

41:54.317 --> 41:56.011
-With ruth bader ginsburg.
-She wants me.

41:56.046 --> 41:56.895
I saw that.

41:56.930 --> 41:59.167
Hey, maybe she persuaded them
to take this case.

41:59.202 --> 42:00.953
To be closer to you.

42:00.988 --> 42:04.175
Oh, ruthie, ruthie, ruthie.

42:05.167 --> 42:07.063
Here we come.
