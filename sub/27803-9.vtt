After you find the others,

00:14.080 --> 00:15.490
the ones that are lost,

00:15.500 --> 00:16.956
you'll just come
back here, right?

00:16.960 --> 00:18.029
Maybe.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.571
Are you Rick?
I'm Helen Hawkins.

There's something
I have to tell you, Helen.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.110
This is my sister.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.168
I'd always assumed
I was the only one.

00:27.170 --> 00:28.876
-I found the one we need.
-You're sure?

00:28.880 --> 00:30.245
IfI can convince her
to come wnlllngly,

00:30.250 --> 00:31.706
I think we'll get
a lot more out of her.

That is what we tell them
when they ask us.

04:34.290 --> 04:35.917
And if they ask why we
didn't call the Coast Guard--

04:35.920 --> 04:37.069
No time.

Why didn't we call them?

Why'd you let it burn?

Surprised me.

I didn't think he'd be there.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.700
He wasn't planning
on showing.

05:01.710 --> 05:04.372
Maybe he changed
his mind about Klesco?

05:07.330 --> 05:10.242
He and Maddie both
show up late, wet hair?

05:10.250 --> 05:11.990
He'd been on my case

Wanted me
to pull my support.

he'd be so reckless.

we're talking about.

a few months, max.

No, we're not.

to help you.

about my sister.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.320
Your sister?

07:48.330 --> 07:52.073
I want to tell her.
About our family.

07:53.290 --> 07:56.532
Uh, you said
she was closed-minded.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.667
She always thought there was
something wrong with me.

07:58.670 --> 07:59.955
Ridiculous.

I just need to show her,
you know?

08:02.580 --> 08:06.164
This secret about our family,

08:07.250 --> 08:08.535
not everyone's ready for it.

08:08.540 --> 08:11.577
I need her to understand.

08:11.580 --> 08:14.879
Okay.
If you're determined,

08:16.790 --> 08:18.030
I'll go with you.

questioned by now.

the more time that passes,

08:59.040 --> 09:00.450
the better off we are.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.075
Do you think
they found their colony?

09:12.210 --> 09:13.780
I don't know.

09:13.790 --> 09:15.109
I hope so.

Look, I've--

09:34.460 --> 09:35.745
I've been listening to it.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.035
What?

09:38.580 --> 09:39.569
The recording you made.

09:41.750 --> 09:42.990
You took the flash drive?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.570
I've been wanting
to tell you.

09:46.330 --> 09:47.786
Does it help?

09:47.790 --> 09:51.749
It's not like the real thing,
not nearly as strong,

09:51.750 --> 09:53.957
but, yeah,
it gets me through.

09:55.750 --> 09:56.785
I want to listen.

09:56.790 --> 09:57.996
Maddie,
it could be dangerous.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.240
But you're listening.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.410
Just to take the edge off.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.456
That's what I need.

10:06.380 --> 10:07.950
I miss her so much.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.280

Nah. We already
have that on file.

I'll bet.

to say then, huh?

It was an accident.

I'm so sorry.

Are you?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.956
I wanted to talk to you
about Decker's research.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.781
He did a whole study
on curing paralytic rats
with stem cells.

27:08.250 --> 27:10.241
-Are you serious right now?
-Ben.

27:10.250 --> 27:12.286
Stem cells he collected
from Ryn's SIster.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.997
Are you trying to use
my mother to manipulate me?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.911
Decker was close
to testIng thIs on humans.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.912
I know all about you.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.660
I know how you
manipulated Xander.

27:21.670 --> 27:24.377
You used him, and now
you're trying to use me.

27:24.380 --> 27:27.281
I didn't use Xander.
I care about him.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.701
You got a funny way
of showing it.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.281

You're good.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.411
She sleep now.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.416
What was that?

28:31.420 --> 28:35.379
In water, some learn this
to help with pain.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.995
I never try before.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.319
Like healing.

28:40.330 --> 28:42.662
No. Not heal.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.200
Move pain away.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.610
Why Ben's mother hurt?

28:49.620 --> 28:52.612
She tried
to get some medicine
that would help her,

28:52.620 --> 28:55.373
but it hurt her.

28:59.330 --> 29:00.410
Ben is love.

29:01.420 --> 29:02.455
Ben's mother is love.

29:04.290 --> 29:05.951
I help Ben.

30:07.330 --> 30:08.570
Your son's a diver, right?

30:08.580 --> 30:10.207
Part fish, I'm thinkin'.

30:10.210 --> 30:12.326
How deep would you say
someone could free dive?

30:12.330 --> 30:16.369
Oh, gosh, I think
the world record's
about 700 feet.

30:17.750 --> 30:18.819
Thanks.

30:18.830 --> 30:20.206

30:30.880 --> 30:32.199

30:32.210 --> 30:34.246

-I got you.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.661
-Better?
-Yeah.

30:43.210 --> 30:47.249
Mom, why didn't you tell me
that you started the trial?

30:47.250 --> 30:49.241
With everything happening
between you and your father,

30:49.250 --> 30:52.208
I-- I didn't want
to upset you.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.371
-[gasp51
-Hey.

30:54.380 --> 30:57.031
Forget about me, okay?

30:57.040 --> 30:58.917
Let's worry
about you right now.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.990
I just feel so foolish.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.286
No, Mom,
you're not foolish.

31:03.290 --> 31:05.952
I just thought,

31:05.960 --> 31:07.370
treatment worked
for some people.

31:07.380 --> 31:08.870
Why not me?

You've gotta

32:23.460 --> 32:25.451
God.

32:25.460 --> 32:27.109
Why do you
always defend him?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.417
There's a lot you don't know.

32:29.670 --> 32:32.036
The company's
in a bad place.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.247
I mean,
we're talking serious debt.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.070
Dad always kept
the books balanced.

32:37.960 --> 32:42.112
plus Mom's
medical expenses.

32:42.120 --> 32:45.533
Ben, it's why Dad
did the deal with Klesco.

32:47.330 --> 32:50.163
If you could do
something to help Mom,

32:50.170 --> 32:51.285
wouldn't you
take the chance?

33:08.210 --> 33:10.246
Hey. Got your text.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.285
What's up?

33:11.290 --> 33:12.370
We need to talk.

-Hey.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.241
Ben's in the cafeteria.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.661
How's Mrs. Pownall?

33:30.670 --> 33:32.410
Honestly, not great.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.376
How you holding up?

33:34.380 --> 33:35.745
I'm okay.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.951
There's a video
from that night.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.995
With the drillship.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.240
Oh, shit. What?

33:43.250 --> 33:44.660
We don't know yet.

33:44.670 --> 33:46.877
I hope it's not of the boat.
I got enough problems.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.609
You'll get
that insurance money soon.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.417
Get back on the water.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.490
I haven't filed
the Insurance yet.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.489
Why?

33:54.500 --> 33:57.071
I dunno, it's just--

33:57.080 --> 33:58.206
Maybe...

33:59.380 --> 34:01.280
Maybe I don't
want another boat.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.667
I feel like this huge weight's
been lifted off me.

34:03.670 --> 34:06.207

your dad worked so hard.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.780
Everyone keeps talking
about my dad.

34:07.790 --> 34:11.169
You know, like the boat
was this big legacy.

34:14.330 --> 34:15.661
Why'd you let it burn?

34:15.670 --> 34:18.377
I got handed this life.

34:18.380 --> 34:20.166
You know,
fishing, the boat.

34:21.170 --> 34:22.489
It was never a choice.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.707
Then all this shit
went down with them and

34:26.250 --> 34:27.376
his death.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.202
I don't know, just made me
question all of it.

34:32.750 --> 34:33.910
What do you want?

34:36.540 --> 34:37.780
I don't know.

34:41.620 --> 34:43.110

34:43.120 --> 34:44.747
Thank you.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.115
Mr. Pownall.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.031
I was just
on my way to see you.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.110
If you want to see me,
make an appointment.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.247
I tried. Your secretary
said you were booked
for the rest of the month.

35:08.250 --> 35:09.660
Yeah, I'm a busy man.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.570
Two weeks since the attack
and no arrests.

35:11.580 --> 35:14.037
As an interested party,
do you have a comment on that?

35:15.710 --> 35:18.110
I believe in letting
law enforcement do their job.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.497
What do you think
about the surveillance
video footage?

35:23.620 --> 35:25.827
You'll have to be
more speCIfIc.

35:25.830 --> 35:29.664
Well, I have a source
claiming that there's video
of a potential suspect.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.537
Then your source
should help the police,

35:32.540 --> 35:33.700
tell them what they know.

willing to help my mom.

Yes. I help.

35:52.460 --> 35:54.530
-I talked to Nicole.
-Without us?

Look, she has research
that could help my mom.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.279
