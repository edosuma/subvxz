WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.032
This is King of
the Mountain. Bare knuckles.

00:04.105 --> 00:06.630
No rules.
Last man on his feet wins.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.035
You got to
fight again, T.C.

00:11.145 --> 00:14.205
No, T.C., please. You just
got to help me. Please.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.011
Wait a minute, wait a minute! No
hitting. That's part of the deal.

00:17.084 --> 00:19.245
I understand the debt
that you feel to him, but-

00:19.320 --> 00:21.015
No. No, you don't.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.080
That's the guy? The big one?
You're going to fight him?

00:24.158 --> 00:25.853
Want a fight?
I'll give you a fight.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.827
<i>When you spend
your every working day...</i>

01:43.904 --> 01:46.566
<i>basking in the balmy breezes
of paradise...</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:50.201
<i>when you play year-round on the
beautiful sunny beaches of the Pacific...</i>

01:50.744 --> 01:52.837
<i>where do you dream
of going on a vacation?</i>

01:52.947 --> 01:55.279
<i>The answer is obvious.
Detroit.</i>

01:55.583 --> 01:58.245
<i>Detroit's a fun city.</i>

01:58.619 --> 01:59.813
<i>Reason two:</i>

01:59.887 --> 02:03.482
<i>There's a superior group of athletes
there, known as the Tigers.</i>

02:03.991 --> 02:06.323
A free trip?

02:06.393 --> 02:09.294
You think you're going to get a free
trip to Detroit on my tab, Thomas?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.888
T.C., I'm doing you a favor.
Favor?

02:12.766 --> 02:15.997
11-14. Attaway to hustle, Vicki.
Come on, you're still in it.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.128
Okay, I mean...

02:17.204 --> 02:20.139
so the Tigers have a 10 day
home stand starting tomorrow.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.767
I mean, that's just a coincidence.
I'm still doing you a favor.

02:22.843 --> 02:23.901
Out!

02:23.978 --> 02:27.505
42 hours in the air searching
for his grandmother's grave.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.645
And the turkey gives me
a bum cashier's check.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.682
But, it doesn't matter.

02:35.422 --> 02:39.950
That collection agency in Detroit
says they can get me my whole $10,000.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.652
Out! 13-14!

02:41.729 --> 02:44.698
So what if they do?
They take 40%%.

02:45.032 --> 02:48.331
Now, I am offering to go
collect your money for free.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.733
Oh, sure. For free.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.367
14! Tie game! What a comeback!

02:54.508 --> 02:58.103
Plus all your expenses,
plus 10 baseball tickets.

02:58.179 --> 03:01.080
Oh, no, no. I'd pay for my
own tickets. T.C., listen.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.644
$1,700 tops on expenses.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.246
13.
16.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.814
14.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.379
15!
Done!

03:18.699 --> 03:20.189
Okay, Thomas.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.232
But no tricks!

03:22.670 --> 03:26.128
$1,500 flat. Anything else
over that and you-

03:26.207 --> 03:28.971
You'll get change.
And $8,500 cash.

03:29.476 --> 03:33.503
And Robin Masters' little red wagon
for the whole time that you're gone.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.875
Sorry, Thomas, but I need wheels.
I'm having problems with the van.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.147
What's wrong with it?
It's not a Ferrari.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.846
What a rally! Keep it
up, girls! Keep it up.

03:41.922 --> 03:46.188
Come on T.C., not the car,
please. Higgins will kill me.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.153
♪ Root, root, root ♪

03:49.230 --> 03:50.356
♪ for the Tigers ♪

03:50.431 --> 03:51.625
What do I tell Higgins?

03:51.699 --> 03:53.929
♪ If they don't win, it's a
shame ♪ Come on, have a heart.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.060
♪ For it's one, two ♪
No, not... Anything but...

03:56.170 --> 03:57.728
♪ three strikes, you're-♪♪
Out!

03:57.805 --> 03:58.829
No!

04:00.808 --> 04:01.934
Okay.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.874
I'll tell Higgins
it's in the shop.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.372
<i>I took the 5:15 milk run...</i>

04:10.451 --> 04:12.316
<i>to Motor City
the following morning.</i>

04:12.486 --> 04:14.283
<i>And T.C. took my car keys.</i>

04:14.355 --> 04:15.822
<i>Now, I know
what you're thinking:</i>

04:15.889 --> 04:18.755
<i>That I was far more interested
in the 10 Tiger games...</i>

04:18.826 --> 04:20.418
<i>than in getting the $10,000.</i>

04:20.494 --> 04:22.985
<i>Actually, I was planning
to see all of both...</i>

04:23.063 --> 04:25.054
<i>give or take a game or $1,000.</i>

04:25.499 --> 04:26.557
<i>For once...</i>

04:26.634 --> 04:29.762
<i>T.C. couldn't say that he
had the bad end of the deal.</i>

04:29.837 --> 04:31.202
<i>I was working for free.</i>

04:31.338 --> 04:33.533
<i>He had the dream car
for nearly two weeks...</i>

04:33.607 --> 04:35.871
<i>and he'd still be getting
the bulk of his money.</i>

04:35.943 --> 04:37.570
<i>He should be in hog heaven.</i>

04:42.349 --> 04:43.475
Ima, look out!

04:44.818 --> 04:46.183
Daddy!

04:47.121 --> 04:49.055
You're hurt. Daddy!

04:49.223 --> 04:50.986
Hey, are you all right?
Oh!

04:51.058 --> 04:52.685
No!
You've hurt him bad!

04:53.160 --> 04:55.685
Hey, look, we better get
you to a hospital, okay?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.732
I haven't got any money
for a hospital.

04:59.033 --> 05:02.332
Mister, please. Hurry. Can't
you see how bad he's hurting?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.928
Yeah. Yeah, sure, okay.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.328
Look...

05:06.740 --> 05:08.605
there's a hospital
not too far away from here.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.735
Don't worry
about the bill, either.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.037
And I'll take care of
the damages to your pigpen.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.810
It's not ours. We were
trying to steal one to eat.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.010
Ima!

05:19.687 --> 05:21.279
Come on, in you go.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.217
Sorry, T.M.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.701
This place belong to the man...

05:36.770 --> 05:38.738
you borrowed that
fancy little red car from?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.740
Well, not exactly.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.342
Now look, Ima,
as long as we're here...

05:48.415 --> 05:50.781
you don't even have to mention
that little red car, okay?

05:53.120 --> 05:56.214
T.C., I don't want you getting
in trouble on account of us.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.990
I told you, I don't hold you
responsible. Come on, Leon.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.061
You and Ima just can't keep
sleeping on the beach every night.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.156
The guy who lives here is out of
town, and he's a friend of mine.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.459
What is wrong with this stupid card
key? It's supposed to be a master.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.103
<i>It only works...</i>

06:12.172 --> 06:14.106
<i>when the security system
is deactivated.</i>

06:14.208 --> 06:15.903
Yeah? Well, then why
don't you deactivate...

06:17.478 --> 06:18.706
Higgins.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.108
Higgie, baby.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.213
T.M. left me his key...

06:25.285 --> 06:27.446
and I just stopped by to get
something that he borrowed.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.546
<i>T.C., why are you here?</i>

06:33.394 --> 06:36.022
Higgins, are you in the mood
for an interesting story?

06:43.270 --> 06:44.635
You ran through a pen...

06:44.705 --> 06:47.606
striking Mr. Platt,
who was chasing a pig.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.840
It's so...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.309
Magnum-esque.

06:53.480 --> 06:58.315
The body has departed, but the spirit
has remained behind to haunt me.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.347
Why? Look, Higgins.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.152
Leon's got a broken
collarbone. He needs rest.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.556
And I was just positive
that Thomas wouldn't mind if-

07:06.627 --> 07:09.892
Magnum has nothing to say about who
does and does not use the guesthouse.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.454
He's little more than
a charity case here himself.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.933
T.C., would you drive us
back to the beach?

07:16.503 --> 07:18.903
We'll get along fine till
I can figure out a way to...

07:18.972 --> 07:21.167
finish my work here
and get us back to Ohio.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.973
You have a job, Mr. Platt?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.875
What kind of work is it
that you do?

07:26.480 --> 07:28.345
Well, I'm a cook
by trade, but-

07:28.415 --> 07:30.406
We had our own
barbecue place back home.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.850
Went under. Past year,
I've been a fighter.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.886
Club fighting. Got a contract
for two more bouts here.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.483
Some contract. Living outside
and chasing pigs to eat.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.827
I didn't say
it was a good contract.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.087
But Charlie's offer
was the only shot I had...

07:44.164 --> 07:46.223
to get us back on our feet,
so I didn't haggle.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.995
Charlie?
Our promoter.

07:49.002 --> 07:52.062
Daddy had to win all the fights
that Charlie got him for a year.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.498
And he has.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.835
We just have these two little
fights to go here, and then...

07:57.377 --> 08:00.278
Forget it,
it doesn't matter now.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.506
Daddy had his accident.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.216
That's not going to
stop me, honey.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.655
It's one of those deals that's
all in the moneyman's favor.

08:12.025 --> 08:15.188
Charlie gets to hold back my prize
money till I meet the champion.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.856
But then I get it all.
$10,000. Win, lose, or draw.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.025
But you can't get in the ring
with a broken collar-

08:21.101 --> 08:23.001
Can't I? You just watch me.

08:23.604 --> 08:27.802
After living like animals for a year,
on what Charlie calls expense money...

08:27.875 --> 08:31.436
there's no way I'm letting that
contract die with just two fights to go.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.975
No, Daddy, you can't.

08:33.413 --> 08:37.144
You could get hurt worse. It's
not fair for this to happen.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.078
We're so darn close.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.825
What would this
Charlie guy say to...

08:47.194 --> 08:49.492
maybe a substitute
for the next couple of fights?

08:49.663 --> 08:52.257
You? No, not a chance.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.163
My God, man,
you can't be serious.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.065
Wait just a minute, Higgie
B, I know what I'm doing.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.125
Do you?

08:57.437 --> 09:00.668
T.C., may we speak in private
for just a moment?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.436
That won't be necessary.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.335
T.C., I thank you
for your gesture, but-

09:06.413 --> 09:09.211
Just for a moment, Mr. Platt,
if you please.

09:12.586 --> 09:13.746
Come on, honey.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.285
You can discuss all you like.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.190
I do my own fighting.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.564
T.C., Mr. Platt is right.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.070
I understand the debt
that you feel to him, but-

09:32.139 --> 09:35.438
No. No. No, you don't.
You weren't there.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.275
I beg your pardon.
I wasn't where?

09:40.414 --> 09:43.474
Oh, hey, this is my problem.
Sorry I bothered you, Higgins.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.642
I wasn't where?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.219
In the DMZ.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.117
Vietnam?

10:01.368 --> 10:03.893
Did you happen to notice
that tattoo on Leon's arm?

10:04.071 --> 10:07.063
A glance, in passing.
US Marine Corps.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.103
What does 4 <i>I</i> 1 mean?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.602
Delta 4 <i>I</i> 1.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.608
Was a hell of a unit.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.946
They came in and
drug me unconscious...

10:19.186 --> 10:21.450
from a downed chopper
in the middle of hell.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.121
They got there just before
the VC would have got to me.

10:27.127 --> 10:31.427
Four of them bought it trying to
save my neck. Six more were wounded.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.700
And you think Leon Platt is
one of the men who rescued you?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.337
I don't know,
but what does it matter?

10:39.640 --> 10:42.473
He's Delta 4 <i>I</i> 1, and I owe him.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.349
The Platts will need fresh
linens in the guesthouse.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.945
I'll see to it.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.554
Does that mean that we can stay?

10:59.593 --> 11:01.458
I forgot my suitcase.

11:04.731 --> 11:08.394
Sure, little girl,
that means you can stay.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.468
And you? You, I'm going to
help you get your money.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.665
Oh, for the last time, T.C.
- Leon!

11:14.908 --> 11:18.742
If this guy Charlie says it's
okay, I want to do it. All right?

11:21.948 --> 11:22.937
Okay.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.041
All right. Now,
when's the next fight?

11:25.118 --> 11:28.645
I want to see if I got enough time
to get the old dukes back in shape.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.351
There's plenty of time. Daddy's not
supposed to fight till tomorrow night.

11:35.962 --> 11:39.056
Wait a minute, wait a minute! No
hitting. That's part of the deal!

11:40.267 --> 11:41.962
Have I hit you yet, Orville?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.592
There's always a first time.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.106
Hey, T.C., you sure you know what you're doing?
I mean, you haven't boxed in years.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.301
Just to pick up and start
boxing in one day, you know-

11:49.376 --> 11:51.640
Hey, hey, hey, we already
discussed it, right?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.712
Come on, let's go get ready
to pick up Leon and Ima.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.077
They went on ahead of us to
talk to Charlie. Where's Charlie?

11:59.286 --> 12:02.449
You'll see. I think I've heard Ice
Pick mention his club. He said it's...

12:02.589 --> 12:05.080
kind of a gentlemen's betting
parlor. Real discreet...

12:05.358 --> 12:06.791
real exclusive.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.512
T.C.!

12:36.056 --> 12:38.752
Can't use these. This is
King of the Mountain.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.320
Bare knuckles. No rules.
Last man on his feet wins.

12:56.658 --> 12:58.888
Tell you the truth,
I didn't think you'd show up.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.121
Tell you the truth,
I'm sorry I did.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.964
No, T.C., wait!

13:05.366 --> 13:08.494
We talked to Charlie.
You can fight. Sorry, Ima.

13:08.803 --> 13:11.670
But you and your daddy left
a few little details out.

13:13.041 --> 13:15.305
Come on, Rick, let's get out
of this butcher shop.

13:15.410 --> 13:17.970
No, T.C., please.
You just got to help me.

13:18.213 --> 13:19.771
Daddy will fight if you don't.

13:19.848 --> 13:22.681
I got to do anything I can
to stop that from happening.

13:22.784 --> 13:24.445
Do you know how bad
he could get hurt?

13:24.519 --> 13:26.419
Do you know how bad
T.C. can get hurt?

13:26.487 --> 13:29.820
Not bad, probably.
But it's not your fight.

13:30.391 --> 13:31.585
I told you that.

13:31.659 --> 13:34.321
What are your chances in
that ring with just one arm?

13:34.395 --> 13:35.384
Not much.

13:35.964 --> 13:38.956
But it's worth a chance.
Got nothing to lose.

13:40.034 --> 13:43.003
T.C., please. Please!

13:53.648 --> 13:55.275
Good to meet you, T.C.

13:56.517 --> 13:59.350
Leon told me
about the accident. Sad.

14:00.455 --> 14:03.481
I shouldn't do this.
No time to promote you.

14:03.925 --> 14:05.392
Oh, I've fought before.

14:08.263 --> 14:11.357
Tell Claude about it.
You're on in five minutes.

14:12.033 --> 14:15.002
Five minutes? Four, actually.
Better make it quick.

14:17.672 --> 14:18.764
Oh, oh, oh.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.173
I was Regional Golden Gloves Champion.
- You were just a kid.

14:23.111 --> 14:26.808
Well, I was the Camp Lejeune Light
Heavyweight Champion - T.C., come on.

14:26.881 --> 14:28.781
That doesn't mean anything here.

14:28.850 --> 14:31.751
Oh, and I was the Grambling
College Southern Conference-

14:31.819 --> 14:34.049
That's enough. Time to fight.
Huh?

14:36.157 --> 14:37.351
T.C.?

14:38.426 --> 14:39.552
Thanks.

14:48.136 --> 14:50.604
This evening's final match!

14:51.439 --> 14:54.067
Replacing the injured,
undefeated...

14:54.142 --> 14:57.373
number-one contender
for the World Champion...

14:57.445 --> 15:00.312
King of the Mountain,
Leon Platt...

15:03.751 --> 15:06.811
a legendary knuckler
from the Mainland!

15:07.989 --> 15:09.047
Presenting...

15:09.724 --> 15:13.387
the reigning New York City
Gold Fist champion...

15:14.028 --> 15:17.395
the combined armed forces world
King of the Mountain champion...

15:17.465 --> 15:19.592
Ebony Assassin of The East...

15:19.834 --> 15:22.234
T.C. Coolidge!

15:22.303 --> 15:24.965
What's with the Ebony Assassin
stuff? It's not T.C. Coolidge.

15:25.039 --> 15:27.735
Close enough. Close enough.
It's Theodore Calvin. Theodore...

15:27.875 --> 15:31.641
Also introducing that great,
undefeated local champion...

15:31.713 --> 15:33.943
Gordon Hui!

15:36.784 --> 15:38.809
Hey, didn't he just
fight just a few minutes ago?

15:38.886 --> 15:40.217
Yeah, doesn't matter.

15:41.089 --> 15:42.647
Gives you the advantage.

16:01.409 --> 16:02.808
Hit him, T.C.!

16:06.414 --> 16:07.403
Hook him!

16:07.482 --> 16:08.449
What are you doing?
Hit him!

16:08.516 --> 16:09.505
Right! Right hand!

16:12.553 --> 16:14.180
Attaboy, T.C.!

17:02.437 --> 17:03.870
All right, T.C.!

17:03.938 --> 17:05.064
I don't believe it!

17:05.940 --> 17:08.407
Hey, hey! You got
some kind of punch!

17:08.476 --> 17:09.704
I don't believe it!

17:10.444 --> 17:12.709
Just caught him off guard
with a lucky punch.

17:13.381 --> 17:15.576
When you said there was
no rules, you meant it!

17:15.650 --> 17:19.176
And that guy, he just.
- He was the local champ, and you...

17:19.252 --> 17:21.813
knocked him out, T.C.!

17:21.888 --> 17:25.188
One more match and we go
for King of the Mountain.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.719
Of the world!

17:27.829 --> 17:31.595
Let's hear it for T.C.!
He's beautiful!

17:32.166 --> 17:33.463
What a man!

17:41.676 --> 17:42.802
<i>And this
looks like it could be...</i>

17:42.877 --> 17:45.368
<i>a real donnybrook, ladies and gentlemen.
There's a pileup on the mound...</i>

17:45.446 --> 17:48.415
Baseball. Give
me a break, will you?

17:50.685 --> 17:53.210
Every day, Tigers,
Tigers, Tigers.

17:53.287 --> 17:56.950
Always interrupting my
programs. I mean, who cares?

17:57.024 --> 18:00.050
I care! Look, could you just put
it back to the game for a second?

18:00.128 --> 18:02.688
There was a big fight - You want
a fight? I'll give you a fight!

18:02.763 --> 18:05.630
Look, I leave here for one minute
to check on what you asked me for...

18:05.700 --> 18:08.726
and you sneak around
and change my TV. Thanks.

18:10.037 --> 18:11.732
I nearly missed
<i>The Dark Side of Dawn.</i>

18:11.806 --> 18:14.673
I'm sorry. But please,
couldn't we just watch the game?

18:14.742 --> 18:17.973
I mean, I'm a big fan. I came to
Detroit just to see the Tigers.

18:18.079 --> 18:21.310
So? Why aren't you out
at the stadium? Because...

18:22.483 --> 18:26.044
Because I can't go to the game
until I find Arnold Morris.

18:26.287 --> 18:29.222
Now, are you going to tell me
where he's moved to, or not?

18:29.290 --> 18:30.689
What do you want
to find him for?

18:30.825 --> 18:33.316
Oh! He's got
your tickets!

18:33.661 --> 18:34.650
No.

18:35.129 --> 18:36.926
I mean, does it really matter?

18:37.165 --> 18:40.100
Okay, fine, he's...

18:40.201 --> 18:42.533
He owes a friend of mine
a whole lot of money.

18:42.970 --> 18:45.404
He owes everybody
a lot of money.

18:45.506 --> 18:47.269
He snuck out of here
about a month ago.

18:47.341 --> 18:50.538
He gave me a bad check
for three months' back rent.

18:51.445 --> 18:52.810
Him and his...

18:53.114 --> 18:54.103
"grandmother."

18:54.582 --> 18:55.571
His grandmother?

18:56.350 --> 18:59.786
But he flew around Hawaii for two weeks
looking for his grandmother's grave.

18:59.854 --> 19:01.947
This grandmother's
very much alive.

19:02.590 --> 19:05.150
Deadbeats, con artists,
the both of them.

19:05.726 --> 19:08.456
May I have the address?
Please?

19:15.903 --> 19:16.995
Flint.

19:17.071 --> 19:18.834
Flint?

19:18.906 --> 19:20.669
That's 60-
60 miles.

19:21.008 --> 19:24.603
Hey, look, if you find him, see
if you can get me my rent, too.

19:25.713 --> 19:26.805
Front desk.

19:28.082 --> 19:32.781
Yeah, yeah. I'll be right up.
Yeah, in about five minutes.

19:38.626 --> 19:40.890
You wanna be in the same shape?

19:44.498 --> 19:46.557
Leon and
Ima's honey-dipped ribs.

19:46.634 --> 19:47.828
Bone-crunching good.

19:48.436 --> 19:50.597
That's gonna be the new name
of our restaurant.

19:50.671 --> 19:52.434
Soon as we get home
with the money.

19:52.506 --> 19:54.064
Hey, man, these are great!

19:54.675 --> 19:56.370
Oh, my God!

19:58.779 --> 20:00.041
What's the matter, Higgins?

20:03.184 --> 20:04.276
Nothing.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.489
Rick and T.C. and Bobby K
and Buster really like them.

20:09.857 --> 20:13.156
Want to try one?
No, thank you, I...

20:13.894 --> 20:15.418
What did you call the lads?

20:16.897 --> 20:17.989
Rick and T.C.?

20:18.532 --> 20:20.295
No, Ima, the lads.

20:21.369 --> 20:23.769
Oh! Bobby K and Buster.

20:24.805 --> 20:26.966
Well, I know that's not
their real names but-

20:27.041 --> 20:28.133
No, indeed.

20:28.209 --> 20:30.871
And I would prefer that you
call them Zeus and Apollo.

20:31.078 --> 20:33.012
Otherwise,
you can only confuse them.

20:33.981 --> 20:35.073
Okay.

20:35.483 --> 20:39.442
But if I had funny-sounding foreign
names like that, I'd get real confused.

20:40.087 --> 20:42.851
T.C., I was
just inspecting your van.

20:43.057 --> 20:45.958
I was pleased to see that
the accident left no damage.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.722
Except, of course, to Leon.

20:48.596 --> 20:51.030
No, no damage.

20:51.098 --> 20:53.464
Hey, Higgins, I'm fighting
tonight. You coming?

20:54.035 --> 20:58.096
I think not. No offense, but I doubt that
the Marquis of Queensberry would approve.

20:58.606 --> 21:01.200
Well, I hope my opponent
doesn't approve, either.

21:01.575 --> 21:03.475
Hey, Leon,
who am I fighting tonight?

21:04.278 --> 21:06.269
Just another one
of Charlie's bums.

21:07.181 --> 21:09.672
You ought to put him away
with just one good punch.

21:25.966 --> 21:27.490
Hail to the champ!

21:33.274 --> 21:34.536
Boy, you were right!

21:34.608 --> 21:35.905
One punch!

21:37.311 --> 21:39.643
Hey, man, this
bare-knuckles stuff is easy.

21:43.384 --> 21:45.249
Like that?
T.C., you did it!

21:46.454 --> 21:49.184
You know what it is?
I think it's my boxing move.

21:49.256 --> 21:51.884
I think it's confusing them.
Really freaks these amateurs out.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.449
Hey, I know what:
Let's celebrate.

21:53.527 --> 21:55.688
Let's go get a pizza,
okay? Good idea.

21:59.433 --> 22:00.695
Leon, what's wrong?

22:03.337 --> 22:04.827
You got to fight
again, T.C.

22:05.506 --> 22:06.564
What?

22:07.775 --> 22:09.800
To qualify for King of the
Mountain Championship...

22:09.877 --> 22:11.868
you got to take on
all comers tonight.

22:12.780 --> 22:14.805
You can still quit
anytime you want to.

22:15.015 --> 22:16.243
I'll understand.

22:16.550 --> 22:18.211
It's my fault, T.C.

22:19.553 --> 22:21.714
Daddy wanted to tell you
but I just wouldn't let him.

22:21.789 --> 22:23.984
Come on, T.C.
Let's get out of here.

22:24.058 --> 22:26.390
Let's go to a library. Let's go
someplace, let's go anyplace...

22:26.460 --> 22:28.121
but let's just get out of here.

22:30.731 --> 22:31.823
How many?

22:33.467 --> 22:34.559
Four.

22:35.469 --> 22:36.561
Five, maybe.

23:21.949 --> 23:24.747
That's five! Five of
them! In under two hours!

23:25.553 --> 23:27.077
T.C., I'm amazed.
You are the best!

23:27.154 --> 23:28.917
You're the best I've
ever seen. Isn't he?

23:30.224 --> 23:32.215
You're good, T.C.
Real good.

23:35.029 --> 23:39.090
Ladies and gentlemen, there
are no further contenders.

23:42.436 --> 23:46.167
Announcing the new
Hawaii Islands...

23:46.240 --> 23:48.333
King of the Mountain Champion...

23:48.476 --> 23:50.910
Theodore Calvin!

23:55.983 --> 24:00.443
But Theodore Calvin is more than just
a man with a tough, talented fist.

24:01.021 --> 24:03.615
He's a man with a titanic heart.

24:05.559 --> 24:09.188
After causing an accident that ended
the career of a great fighter...

24:09.296 --> 24:12.732
he stepped forward and said,
"I will be your fists."

24:12.967 --> 24:15.265
"I will give you
your victory."

24:15.870 --> 24:19.897
Theodore Calvin said these
words to the great Leon Platt.

24:23.110 --> 24:26.568
And this Saturday evening,
in this very arena...

24:26.981 --> 24:30.712
you will be able to put that
two-fisted devotion to Leon's dream...

24:30.784 --> 24:32.149
to the ultimate test.

24:32.219 --> 24:36.553
You will stand in this
very spot, in combat...

24:36.857 --> 24:39.587
with a man
who needs no introduction...

24:39.860 --> 24:42.988
a man who sits
in this very arena tonight.

24:43.564 --> 24:47.466
The great, the legendary,
the undefeated...

24:47.535 --> 24:50.663
King of the Mountain
World Champion...

24:50.771 --> 24:53.001
Condley Willard!

25:40.886 --> 25:43.013
Come on, Orville. He not
that much bigger than I am.

25:43.088 --> 25:45.648
Yeah, well, a tank isn't
that much bigger than a truck.

25:45.724 --> 25:47.453
But it can do a lot more damage.

25:47.593 --> 25:50.118
299, 300. Yeah.

25:51.029 --> 25:52.519
Condley's not a boxer.

25:53.031 --> 25:54.020
I am.

25:54.099 --> 25:55.327
Yes, but
Condley is a barbarian...

25:55.400 --> 25:56.424
and you are not.

25:56.502 --> 25:58.197
Hey, man, I thought
you were with me.

25:58.270 --> 25:59.965
I thought you understood
why I was doing this.

26:00.038 --> 26:03.735
T.C., we do understand. And believe
me, we believe in your quest.

26:03.809 --> 26:05.902
But having thrown down
your gauntlet for the man...

26:05.978 --> 26:08.276
and winning joust
after joust with ease...

26:08.347 --> 26:11.339
please do not underestimate the
strength of the final knight.

26:12.084 --> 26:14.552
Bet you went to college,
didn't you, Mr. Higgins?

26:14.953 --> 26:16.386
Yes, my dear, I did.

26:17.823 --> 26:19.381
What are you doing with those?

26:19.491 --> 26:21.152
You can't use them right now.

26:21.593 --> 26:23.458
Oh, and you can?
Sure.

26:24.162 --> 26:27.529
All right, T.C., you've been looking for
somebody with some real boxing skills.

26:27.599 --> 26:29.624
Maybe you should take her on
for a couple of rounds.

26:31.003 --> 26:33.904
All right, come on, kid.
Get him, kid!

26:36.074 --> 26:38.508
Come on, what you gonna do, huh?

26:39.311 --> 26:41.871
Come on, Ima. When you
gonna land some punches?

26:44.016 --> 26:45.984
Right! Left!

26:46.218 --> 26:48.550
Right! Left!

26:50.255 --> 26:53.713
She did it! She did it.
The new King of the Mountain!

26:53.926 --> 26:55.120
Ima Platt!

26:55.193 --> 26:56.592
Yay for Ima!

26:57.362 --> 26:59.296
I've been
everywhere in Detroit...

26:59.364 --> 27:00.661
but the ballpark.

27:01.266 --> 27:02.699
I go to eight addresses.

27:02.768 --> 27:06.260
♪♪ Uptown, downtown, across town.

27:06.338 --> 27:08.499
I even take a bus to Flint.

27:09.007 --> 27:11.601
Thanks. And do you know
where I find Arnold Morris?

27:11.843 --> 27:15.574
No, where? In a room, three
blocks from the stadium.

27:15.647 --> 27:18.081
The one place in Detroit
I really want to be.

27:18.951 --> 27:20.919
Sorry you missed it, my man.

27:21.286 --> 27:22.753
It was a great home stand.

27:22.821 --> 27:24.413
Yeah.
We've been to every game.

27:24.723 --> 27:25.849
You have?

27:26.158 --> 27:27.489
Boy, that's great.

27:28.427 --> 27:31.157
Who's Arnold?
Arnold Morris is a...

27:32.497 --> 27:35.091
Never mind. Anyway, it's a
long story, But the point is...

27:35.167 --> 27:36.156
I mean, now...

27:36.234 --> 27:39.328
I can finally go to the 10th and
last game of the home stand...

27:39.404 --> 27:40.393
and it's sold out!

27:40.973 --> 27:43.134
It's completely sold out!
It's unbelievable.

27:47.813 --> 27:51.112
I'm sorry about your troubles,
guy. The beers are on us.

27:51.350 --> 27:54.217
Here's our business
cards. Call us. Thanks.

27:56.121 --> 27:57.952
Hey, wait a minute.
Guys! Wait...

28:01.226 --> 28:03.057
These are prime seats
to tomorrow's game.

28:03.128 --> 28:05.221
Yeah. You're sitting
between home and first.

28:05.297 --> 28:07.663
We'll be between first
and third. Wave to us.

28:07.733 --> 28:10.998
Wait! Wait a minute. There's no
seats between first and third.

28:11.069 --> 28:12.627
See you tomorrow at the game.

28:19.444 --> 28:21.309
Yeah, Trammell and Whitaker.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.738
No!

28:23.148 --> 28:24.809
Come on, they're not.

28:24.883 --> 28:27.613
Yep. They're putting you
in Section 206, Row A.

28:29.588 --> 28:30.782
Guys?

28:31.857 --> 28:32.881
Guys!

28:33.592 --> 28:35.355
Why does he
keep a baseball glove...

28:35.427 --> 28:36.917
in his refrigerator?

28:36.995 --> 28:40.487
Beats me. You'll have to ask
him. This stuff is no good.

28:41.600 --> 28:45.092
I wanted to make a special dinner
for the night before the championship.

28:47.305 --> 28:48.533
Hey, I got it.

28:48.740 --> 28:51.300
Why don't I take you
and your daddy out to dinner?

28:51.910 --> 28:54.879
Sit-down fancy, or drive-in?
Sit-down fancy.

28:55.113 --> 28:56.307
T.C., wow!

28:56.381 --> 28:57.370
Ima.

28:57.983 --> 28:59.974
Would you please take
the dogs for a walk?

29:00.052 --> 29:01.815
T.C. and I need
to discuss something.

29:01.887 --> 29:03.081
Okay, Daddy.

29:03.188 --> 29:05.748
But then T.C. is taking
us out to a fancy dinner.

29:06.391 --> 29:07.915
Fine. Now get along, now.

29:14.633 --> 29:15.998
Leon, what's going on?

29:18.303 --> 29:20.362
You got to go down
in the first tomorrow night.

29:23.508 --> 29:25.339
Sure. Who says?
I do.

29:26.745 --> 29:29.680
Look, that contract says...

29:29.881 --> 29:31.508
that I get the money
that's coming to me...

29:31.583 --> 29:33.983
whether I win, lose or draw. Okay!
Win, lose or draw. Yeah, yeah.

29:34.052 --> 29:36.885
So what do you care? You
take the first good hit...

29:36.955 --> 29:38.252
and you fall down.

29:38.323 --> 29:39.347
Hmm?

29:39.424 --> 29:40.356
Oh...

29:40.425 --> 29:41.414
kay...

29:41.493 --> 29:42.482
Nah.

29:42.594 --> 29:44.687
It wouldn't be right.
Right?

29:45.130 --> 29:47.792
Right. You hold a lot of stock
in that sort of thing, don't you?

29:47.866 --> 29:48.958
Sure!

29:49.735 --> 29:53.569
You don't? Not in this case.
I'm trying to save you...

29:53.839 --> 29:55.670
from a beating
you'll never forget.

29:55.907 --> 29:57.238
A beat...

29:57.442 --> 29:59.501
Leon, I can take Condley.

29:59.578 --> 30:01.739
Dream on!
Condley'll kill you.

30:01.913 --> 30:04.347
Please, go in the first.

30:05.217 --> 30:07.082
Leon-
Look!

30:07.786 --> 30:10.914
You were probably a hell of a
fighter back in the Golden Gloves.

30:10.989 --> 30:12.616
But you want to know the truth?

30:14.025 --> 30:15.583
As a bare-knuckler...

30:15.660 --> 30:16.649
you stink.

30:17.129 --> 30:18.494
But I'm undefeated.

30:18.830 --> 30:21.697
Because Charlie paid off
all those guys to take dives!

30:26.738 --> 30:27.898
That's crazy.

30:28.907 --> 30:29.896
No.

30:30.442 --> 30:31.773
No, that's business.

30:32.577 --> 30:33.839
Nobody can beat Condley.

30:34.479 --> 30:38.245
So Charlie has to make it look like
some wonder from out of nowhere can.

30:38.483 --> 30:40.542
First it was me, now you.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.748
Oh, come on, look!
Look at my face.

30:45.457 --> 30:46.822
And now look at yours.

30:47.993 --> 30:49.790
I was undefeated, too.

30:51.296 --> 30:53.161
Yeah, well, if that's so true...

30:53.398 --> 30:55.127
why you pulling out
of the con now?

30:55.200 --> 30:56.997
I mean, why this big
act of friendship?

30:57.068 --> 30:58.558
Con? The hell you say!

30:58.637 --> 31:01.162
I tried to stop you from getting
involved. I kept telling you...

31:01.239 --> 31:02.638
you could pull out
anytime you wanted to!

31:02.707 --> 31:04.197
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Sure! Sure! Sure you did!

31:04.276 --> 31:06.870
Every time you led me
to some new little surprise.

31:06.978 --> 31:08.741
Well then, why did you do it?

31:08.847 --> 31:10.314
Come on, T.C., level.

31:10.982 --> 31:14.213
I mean, why would you go through
all this for a guy like me?

31:14.286 --> 31:15.878
There has got to be
a better reason.

31:15.954 --> 31:17.546
Yeah, well, it wasn't for you...

31:17.622 --> 31:21.149
or your collarbone,
or the $10,000, or even Ima.

31:21.827 --> 31:25.024
It was for a bunch of guys from
your unit that I owe a debt to.

31:25.997 --> 31:27.464
They saved my skin!

31:28.333 --> 31:31.268
There's the better reason!
Delta 4 <i>I</i> 1!

31:35.173 --> 31:36.731
You can forget that.

31:37.075 --> 31:39.270
I'm not one of your
Delta heroes.

31:39.578 --> 31:41.239
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

31:41.413 --> 31:43.881
Whether you were there or
not, you were in the unit.

31:43.982 --> 31:45.847
And that's who I owe
the debt to. The unit.

31:46.017 --> 31:48.485
Well, you're paying off
through the wrong guy.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.178
Sure, I was a Delta 4 <i>I</i> 1.

31:50.589 --> 31:52.887
But I got out of it,
on a dishonorable.

31:53.625 --> 31:57.117
A buddy of mine and me, we were just
clowning around, friendly fist fight.

31:57.495 --> 31:59.224
He didn't wanna give up, either.

32:00.332 --> 32:02.857
I hit him just once
too many times.

32:03.134 --> 32:04.863
And that...
T.C.?

32:04.936 --> 32:05.925
T.C.!

32:06.404 --> 32:08.429
That's what Condley
can do to you...

32:08.506 --> 32:10.098
if you don't listen to me now!

32:11.443 --> 32:13.604
I don't want to see
you get hurt, man.

32:14.246 --> 32:17.647
You're the first real friend
I've had in a long time! "Friend"?

32:18.183 --> 32:19.172
"Friend"?

32:19.251 --> 32:20.684
No way, man!

32:20.752 --> 32:22.777
And you don't have to worry
about me anymore, either.

32:22.854 --> 32:24.378
I am not fighting Condley
at all...

32:24.456 --> 32:25.616
and you can tell...

32:26.191 --> 32:27.317
Charlie...

32:27.392 --> 32:29.121
the Ebony Assassin quit.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.124
Busy?

33:10.268 --> 33:11.735
You got it, Charlie baby.

33:11.937 --> 33:14.667
Just got back from a trip
to the far side of the island.

33:15.006 --> 33:16.530
Got to head right back.

33:16.608 --> 33:18.041
So the rumor I heard was true.

33:18.109 --> 33:19.201
You're not
going to fight tonight.

33:19.277 --> 33:21.404
Does it sound like I'm planning to? No.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.114
Look, I got a lot
of money invested.

33:24.282 --> 33:25.943
Lot of local money bet.

33:26.518 --> 33:28.281
Some jerks even bet on you.

33:29.254 --> 33:30.687
Too bad.

33:31.690 --> 33:33.123
I don't want to hurt Ima.

33:36.962 --> 33:40.329
Found her out for a walk on the beach.
Real depressed about you cutting out.

33:40.632 --> 33:42.657
Where is she, Charlie?
What did you-

33:42.734 --> 33:44.998
Put up a hell of a fight.
Good little fighter.

33:46.371 --> 33:47.497
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:47.572 --> 33:49.563
Save it. Save it.
Save it for tonight.

33:49.641 --> 33:50.699
Save it.

33:51.576 --> 33:52.736
You'll need it.

34:11.643 --> 34:14.841
T.C., perhaps we have to take
the risk of going to the police.

34:14.914 --> 34:17.109
At least they should
be on hand tonight.

34:17.183 --> 34:18.411
No police.

34:18.751 --> 34:19.945
The best thing would've been...

34:20.018 --> 34:21.815
to let crooks deal with crooks.

34:21.888 --> 34:23.286
You talked to Ice Pick?

34:23.690 --> 34:26.123
Yeah, this morning, right
after we found out about Ima.

34:26.192 --> 34:27.625
But he can't help.

34:28.428 --> 34:31.295
T.C., look, the guy's got Feds
crawling all over his back.

34:31.364 --> 34:33.855
He's in the middle of
a Senate hearing right now.

34:44.444 --> 34:48.813
Rick, I understand T.C.'s problem,
okay? But I'm 4,000 miles away.

34:48.882 --> 34:52.010
Thomas, there's a flight that'll get
you here on time. Higgins checked.

34:52.085 --> 34:54.610
It leaves Detroit at 6:00.
I've reserved you a seat.

34:54.888 --> 34:57.322
6:00? Oh, phooey.

34:57.557 --> 35:00.117
That's less than an hour
from now. I can't.

35:00.994 --> 35:04.293
Magnum, please. Would I, of all
people, ask you to return early...

35:04.364 --> 35:06.491
<i>if it were not an emergency?</i>

35:06.866 --> 35:08.959
Okay, okay.

35:09.035 --> 35:11.731
I'll do my best to catch
the 6:00 flight.

35:11.804 --> 35:14.364
How'd you know I was at the game?

35:14.741 --> 35:16.333
It was a logical presumption.

35:16.442 --> 35:18.933
Haven't you been attending
all of the Lions matches?

35:19.012 --> 35:20.912
No! This is the first one.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.972
And it's not a "Lions match,"
it's a "Tigers game."

35:24.050 --> 35:27.451
A game that Alan Trammell and Lou
Whitaker personally gave me tickets for.

35:27.553 --> 35:30.249
And I was going to meet Sparky
and the entire team afterwards.

35:30.323 --> 35:31.881
<i>Thomas, you're wasting time.</i>

35:31.958 --> 35:33.823
<i>Grab a taxi
and get to the airport.</i>

35:33.960 --> 35:35.450
Okay, okay!

35:35.628 --> 35:37.562
I said I'd be there.

35:45.905 --> 35:47.236
Bye, guys.

36:00.954 --> 36:03.422
Now look,
T.C., there are 15 rounds.

36:03.489 --> 36:05.548
Charlie says you
got to stay up for 10.

36:06.492 --> 36:09.086
10? Wait a minute, there's
no way he can make it.

36:09.162 --> 36:12.063
I'll make it. Look, if you
don't, Charlie loses money.

36:12.265 --> 36:14.529
And Leon loses
a sweet little girl.

36:15.601 --> 36:17.159
I said I'll stay up!

36:19.605 --> 36:22.403
Only trouble is, Condley says
he's gonna put you away in two.

36:25.011 --> 36:26.273
Oh, man.

36:27.814 --> 36:29.782
I've really made
a mess of things.

36:30.383 --> 36:33.614
First I risked your life,
now Ima's.

36:34.587 --> 36:35.576
Yeah.

36:36.089 --> 36:38.922
Well I hope you're wrong
about risking mine.

36:38.992 --> 36:42.086
'Cause if I can't stay up
with Condley for 10 rounds...

36:43.296 --> 36:44.524
T.C.?

36:46.933 --> 36:48.560
I don't believe this.

36:48.634 --> 36:49.658
Who are you?

36:49.736 --> 36:52.466
The man who left all the
dirty linens in the guesthouse.

36:52.538 --> 36:55.302
T.C., we felt that Magnum should
be advised of the situation.

36:55.375 --> 36:57.741
Hey, T.C., we would have told you
earlier, but we weren't sure...

36:57.810 --> 36:59.675
if we'd get Thomas here
from the airport in time.

36:59.746 --> 37:01.737
For what? You got a plan
to get Ima back before-

37:01.814 --> 37:04.510
No. I don't have anything
at the moment but jet lag.

37:04.984 --> 37:06.417
You don't have my money?

37:07.453 --> 37:08.442
Yes!

37:08.521 --> 37:10.785
No, wait. I mean,
I've got jet lag...

37:10.857 --> 37:12.654
and your money. All of it.

37:12.725 --> 37:14.215
Arnold's grandmother
took out a loan.

37:14.293 --> 37:16.989
I think the important thing
right now is to figure out...

37:17.063 --> 37:18.724
how to force
this Charlie guy-

37:18.798 --> 37:20.390
Almost time, T.C.
Let's go.

37:23.836 --> 37:27.738
That's the guy? The big one?
You're going to fight him?

37:27.807 --> 37:29.775
Hey, didn't I tell you
it was serious?

37:29.842 --> 37:32.310
It's not just
his size. He's mean.

37:32.512 --> 37:36.107
He'll try every dirty trick in the book.
And some that haven't been written.

37:36.182 --> 37:38.377
Well, that's okay, T.C., we'll
just think of something, fast.

37:38.451 --> 37:41.443
Look! Why won't anybody believe
that I can stay with this guy?

37:41.521 --> 37:43.182
I mean, I have to. I...

37:44.090 --> 37:45.455
I better get out there.

37:48.528 --> 37:50.689
Wait a minute.
Rick, now...

37:51.130 --> 37:53.724
What about Ice Pick? I mean,
isn't Charlie under his-

37:53.800 --> 37:55.825
Yeah, yeah, but look,
just forget about it, Thomas.

37:55.902 --> 37:58.462
I spoke to him this morning and
he doesn't want to get involved.

37:58.538 --> 38:01.871
Apparently Mr. Ice Pick has a
problem with parliamentary procedure.

38:01.941 --> 38:03.499
It's the Senate, Higgins.

38:03.576 --> 38:05.806
And Ice Pick can't get
involved in any more trouble.

38:05.878 --> 38:09.006
Yeah, but Charlie doesn't know
that. Rick, now you stay with T.C...

38:09.082 --> 38:11.607
but you get word to Charlie
that somebody's in his office...

38:11.717 --> 38:13.412
with a message
from Ice Pick, and then...

38:13.486 --> 38:16.546
see, Higgins will let you know
if Ima's all right...

38:16.656 --> 38:19.625
and then you can tell T.C.
to quit, whatever round it is.

38:20.660 --> 38:21.786
Okay, you got it.

38:22.595 --> 38:26.087
No, I don't. But I got about half
of it, and I just hope it works.

38:29.335 --> 38:30.962
Ladies and gentlemen!

38:31.270 --> 38:34.296
For the King of the Mountain
Championship of the World...

38:34.774 --> 38:38.471
introducing the contender,
the new Hawaii King...

38:38.711 --> 38:41.612
the sensation of the Islands,
the Ebony Assassin...

38:41.681 --> 38:43.376
Theodore Calvin!

38:52.959 --> 38:57.726
From Lubbock, Texas, the reigning,
one and only, never defeated...

38:58.097 --> 39:00.395
World-champion
bare-knuckler...

39:00.466 --> 39:02.991
Condley Willard!

39:18.985 --> 39:22.318
Now, the championship rules for bare-knuckle
fighting are that there are none.

39:22.388 --> 39:24.185
So, let's have a nice,
clean fight.

39:29.829 --> 39:31.023
All right, come here.

39:31.097 --> 39:33.895
We got everything worked out.
Higgins is gonna give a signal.

39:33.966 --> 39:35.661
When Higgins gives the signal...

40:03.496 --> 40:04.485
Charlie Amos?

40:05.097 --> 40:06.086
Yeah.

40:09.035 --> 40:10.434
What's Ice Pick want?

40:12.738 --> 40:14.069
Your neck, Charlie.

40:14.941 --> 40:17.273
I mean, he's let you get
away with a lot of things...

40:17.376 --> 40:19.276
but he draws the line
at kidnapping.

40:19.712 --> 40:21.942
This guy here tells me
you nabbed his little girl...

40:22.014 --> 40:23.777
to cover your bets.
Is that right?

40:57.683 --> 40:58.672
Get up!

40:58.985 --> 41:00.247
Come on.

41:02.722 --> 41:04.314
You're stalling, Charlie.

41:08.227 --> 41:09.251
Okay.

41:10.696 --> 41:12.994
Either you hand over
little Ima...

41:13.065 --> 41:15.056
or I'm going to
have to call Ice Pick.

41:17.203 --> 41:18.534
Do me a favor.

41:19.238 --> 41:20.227
Call him.

41:25.511 --> 41:27.911
Well, I will
if you make me, but...

41:28.914 --> 41:32.941
I got to tell you, Charlie, Ice Pick's
really already very upset with you.

41:33.019 --> 41:36.216
Now, he's liable to kill you
if you make me call him at home.

41:37.390 --> 41:40.291
Ice Pick's on the Mainland.
Senate subpoena.

41:41.193 --> 41:42.455
If you're a close associate...

41:43.095 --> 41:44.392
you should know that.

41:48.567 --> 41:51.058
Yeah, I should.
I really should.

41:58.244 --> 42:00.474
Where is she, Charlie?
Before I kill you.

42:22.568 --> 42:25.594
Where is she? Okay! Okay! I'll
tell you where she is, okay?

42:25.671 --> 42:26.933
Let me go. Come on.

43:17.823 --> 43:19.381
Ah!
Okay, okay, sorry.

43:25.231 --> 43:28.223
T.C., it's okay. Higgins just
gave me the signal. You can quit.

43:30.136 --> 43:32.604
Hey, did you hear me?
They got Ima. Get out!

43:33.038 --> 43:36.132
Condley's the one going out.
He does have a weak spot.

44:37.436 --> 44:39.233
<i>T.C. slept for 14 hours...</i>

44:39.305 --> 44:41.796
<i>trying to recoup from the
toughest fight of his life.</i>

44:41.941 --> 44:43.533
<i>And I slept for 16...</i>

44:43.609 --> 44:47.340
<i>trying to find the six hours
I'd left in a taxi in Detroit.</i>

44:47.780 --> 44:49.304
<i>Finally, he had to break down...</i>

44:49.381 --> 44:51.110
<i>and tell me about the Ferrari.</i>

44:51.884 --> 44:54.546
<i>But it would be out of the
shop in 24 hours, paid for...</i>

44:54.620 --> 44:56.781
<i>and, hopefully, Higgins
would never be the wiser.</i>

45:02.127 --> 45:03.321
T.C.!

45:05.331 --> 45:06.958
I was afraid that
you wouldn't come.

45:07.032 --> 45:10.593
What? And miss saying goodbye
to my favorite girl? No way!

45:10.669 --> 45:13.035
You'll still come and
see us in Ohio, won't you?

45:13.105 --> 45:14.902
I can almost taste the barbecue.

45:18.010 --> 45:19.136
Take it.

45:20.079 --> 45:22.741
Half the $10,000.
You sure earned it.

45:34.126 --> 45:36.788
Leon, why don't you
do me a favor?

45:37.796 --> 45:40.458
Why don't you take that and
invest it in the restaurant?

45:41.133 --> 45:42.794
That way we can be partners.

45:46.338 --> 45:47.566
Thanks.

45:50.643 --> 45:53.544
I was with Delta 4 <i>I</i> 1 for
three years. No dishonorable.

45:54.547 --> 45:55.912
You've paid your debts.

45:58.183 --> 45:59.343
Come and see us.

46:00.719 --> 46:01.845
And your place.

46:02.721 --> 46:04.450
You too, Magnum.
Thanks.

46:06.458 --> 46:07.755
Come on, honey.
Bye.

46:07.826 --> 46:08.918
Bye-bye.

46:11.830 --> 46:14.230
Bye, Bobby K! Bye, Buster!

46:18.571 --> 46:20.801
Bobby K and Buster?

46:49.068 --> 46:51.332
Higgins, where
did you find the...

46:51.503 --> 46:53.971
At the discount body shop
where you left it.

46:54.406 --> 46:57.807
They feared that it was a stolen
car, and checked the registration.

46:57.876 --> 47:00.140
They called me two days
after the accident.

47:00.212 --> 47:04.205
Higgie - In lieu of an explanation
that I could not bear...

47:05.184 --> 47:09.245
just give me $3,716.53.

47:10.723 --> 47:12.190
Zeus. Apollo.

47:18.931 --> 47:20.091
Lads?

47:25.004 --> 47:26.301
Higgins?

47:27.640 --> 47:30.541
Maybe you should try
"Buster" and "Bobby K."

47:31.410 --> 47:33.844
Now, that's absurd.
I mean...

47:39.318 --> 47:41.343
Buster? Bobby K?
