00:01.002 --> 00:02.117
(man): Previously on Haven...

00:02.253 --> 00:04.710
(Croatoan): Stop! I will kill you!

00:05.173 --> 00:07.664
- Wake up... Wake up, damn it.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.176
He got a message to us.

00:09.594 --> 00:13.132
- Croatoan is coming for Audrey.
This is where we're making our stand.

00:13.264 --> 00:16.427
- I've lost so much to the Troubles.
My sister. My daughter.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.925
I'm not gonna let anything else
get taken from me again.

00:19.061 --> 00:22.599
- If we can't build a new Barn,
we can't defeat Croatoan.

00:22.732 --> 00:25.474
I have to get these things to do something.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.942
- Why have you brought me here?
(Nathan): Howard.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.402
(Audrey): Can you use this
to build a new Barn?

00:30.531 --> 00:31.907
- The Aether core has been cracked.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.274
Stability is compromised.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.696
- Did it damage you?
- Yes.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.369
(Audrey): Who did this to Howard?

00:41.250 --> 00:42.410
(Nathan): Duke.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.034
(Audrey): Croatoan must be
controlling him somehow.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.580
Duke, why are you doing this?

00:49.717 --> 00:53.835
- I am doing what my family
was created to do.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.978
(ominous music)

01:10.488 --> 01:13.696
- Duke, please, no.

01:15.451 --> 01:18.818
- I don't want to stop.

01:18.955 --> 01:20.445
- Duke, let me go.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.913
- And I am finally taking orders...

01:23.793 --> 01:26.785
from the person that I was always meant to.

01:28.631 --> 01:30.292
(gaSDS)

01:38.975 --> 01:40.840
- Is anybody out there?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.271
Please.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.637
Let me out!

01:47.149 --> 01:49.401
(footsteps approach, door opens)

01:55.992 --> 01:57.232
- Hello, Dove.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.612
You hungry?

02:08.838 --> 02:11.671
(chuckling)
You know, I gave you that nickname.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.082
Dove.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.251
Not because you were peaceful.

02:16.387 --> 02:17.467
(chuckling)

02:17.596 --> 02:18.802
Hardly.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.508
No, I gave it to you
because I saw that you could soar.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.605
- Croatoan.

02:30.901 --> 02:31.890
- Not Dad?

02:33.946 --> 02:34.981
All right.

02:36.115 --> 02:38.527
But clearly we have
a lot of catching up to do.

02:47.585 --> 02:50.327
(McHugh): We covered the whole waterfront.
No sign of her.

02:50.463 --> 02:53.250
(Nathan): Damn it. Dwight, what happened?

02:54.133 --> 02:55.839
- McHugh and I went by Hanlon's house.

02:55.968 --> 03:00.382
Hoping we could use his Trouble
to find Audrey, but Duke got to him first.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.675
- That makes four Troubled
people that Duke murdered.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.180
Aâ€œ last night.

03:04.894 --> 03:07.556
He's got to be collecting
Troubles for Croatoan.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.852
- Is that why you got my guys
pulling Troubled people off the street?

03:12.443 --> 03:14.274
To keep them safe from Duke?
Stashing them here?

03:15.112 --> 03:17.945
Or are you using them as bait?
- Both.

03:18.074 --> 03:20.030
Your guys know the plan
and they're on board.

03:20.618 --> 03:24.452
We catch Duke, we can force him to tell us
where Croatoan's hiding Audrey.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.913
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not
doing this just because it's Audrey.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.077
- I'm good with this.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.577
We need her.
She's our only hope to cure the Troubles.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.083
(Nathan): Duke.

03:35.216 --> 03:38.208
(suspenseful music)

03:40.262 --> 03:42.719
(theme music)

04:12.294 --> 04:13.283
(McHugh): Get him!

04:14.713 --> 04:17.375
Get his arms.
(Nathan): Hold on. Don't get too close.

04:17.508 --> 04:21.000
- Ah!
(Nathan): Everyone, stand back.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.263
Don't shoot.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.388
Duke, Duke, stop!

04:26.517 --> 04:29.179
Ah!
(chokes)

04:29.311 --> 04:30.471
Duke...

04:31.647 --> 04:34.104
please... stop.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.729
- Nathan?
(gasping)

04:37.862 --> 04:39.602
- McHugh.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.233
(groans)

04:43.868 --> 04:47.577
- Hold him down.
- Whatever you're gonna do, do it now!

04:47.705 --> 04:50.697
(suspenseful music)

04:57.047 --> 04:59.663
- Hell of a plan, Nathan.
But it actually worked.

05:00.593 --> 05:03.255
Now, what do we do
to keep him under control?

05:03.387 --> 05:05.969
- Chain him up.
- Hang on, Ted.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.089
We're gonna get you help.
- Okay.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.932
- What's gonna stop Duke from using
Hailie's Trouble to phase through them?

05:11.479 --> 05:13.265
- 'Cause they're made from an old Trouble,

05:13.898 --> 05:17.265
by a prison guard who wanted to stop Hailie's
great-grandfather from escaping.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.643
He couldn't phase through them.
Duke won't be able to, either.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.815
Now we just got to get him to talk.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.074
(mysterious music)

05:28.204 --> 05:29.489
- You look nervous.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.570
So unlike you.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.789
- Let me go.
- Are you thirsty?

05:33.918 --> 05:37.160
- Where is Duke? What have you done with him?
- I could get you some coffee.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.291
You like coffee.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.085
Even when you were a little girl.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.088
You were adorable.

05:45.721 --> 05:48.337
You loved coffee.
You loved music.

05:48.474 --> 05:49.714
You loved dogs.

05:50.226 --> 05:52.012
So many of the same things--
- Shut up.

05:53.479 --> 05:54.468
Shut up.

05:54.813 --> 05:55.939
- Why?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.472
Don't you want to know?

05:58.984 --> 06:01.145
We have all those things back home.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.609
- What home?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.444
- Ours. Yours and mine.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.780
It has similarities to this world,

06:06.909 --> 06:09.571
but it is... far more advanced now.

06:10.287 --> 06:14.121
Except for a few warts, it's wonderful.

06:15.918 --> 06:19.160
I'm going back there, taking you with me.
You'll be much happier there.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.622
- You don't know anything about me.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.045
- That's not true, Dove.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.511
This room,

06:29.640 --> 06:31.756
it's just like the room you grew up in.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.131
I love it.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.599
- You mean Mara's room.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.312
Is that what this is about?

06:43.988 --> 06:45.603
You want your daughter back?

06:47.116 --> 06:48.856
Well, you can't have her.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.192
Mara is dead.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.196
- Mara is dead. I know.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.616
But you're still my daughter.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.835
And yes... I want you back.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.265
- | just need to know that Dave's death
counted for something.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.349
That he didn't die in vain.

07:17.021 --> 07:18.557
This new Barn,

07:18.689 --> 07:22.898
when it cures the Troubles,
will it stop Croatoan?

07:24.028 --> 07:25.359
- Yes.

07:25.487 --> 07:29.196
The Aether core will act as a power source,
drawing like to like.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.441
lt'll pull out all the Aether,
everything from the Void,

07:31.577 --> 07:34.535
including Croatoan, and send it back.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.408
- What's your role in all this?

07:37.541 --> 07:40.157
- My function is similar to, um...

07:41.545 --> 07:44.628
Think of it like a ship,
and I am its captain.

07:44.757 --> 07:48.341
I tell all the pieces how to work together,
what to do and when to do it.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.050
- So, what's next?

07:50.554 --> 07:53.170
What else do we need
to complete the new Barn?

07:53.307 --> 07:57.095
- Once the Aether core is repaired,
you will have all the materials you need.

07:57.227 --> 08:00.014
But, uh, I can't operate it.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.603
Not anymore.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.101
- What?

08:05.277 --> 08:07.188
- Back in the police station,

08:07.571 --> 08:12.156
when I attempted to create the Barn
with the damaged Aether core, I was...

08:15.245 --> 08:16.860
compromised.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.782
I can no longer serve
as the Barn's controller.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.429
- Chains seem to be working as advertised.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.549
- And Laverne's keeping an eye on him, too.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.675
- Good.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.346
So, you're just gonna go in there
and talk to him?

08:44.483 --> 08:48.396
I mean, what do you even say to that?
- That is still Duke.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.862
He's still in there.
- Why? Because his eyes changed back?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.605
How can you be sure?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.196
- You saw what happened
when he had me by the throat.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.200
He could've killed me.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.323
He recognized me. Hesitated.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.166
That's the real Duke.
That's who I'm gonna talk to.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.705
- I've heard this song before, Nathan.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.204
- And I was right before.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.835
Back in my father's cabin,

09:10.968 --> 09:13.459
Duke bought me time to try
and draw Audrey out of Mara.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.465
And it worked.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.381
He deserves the same chance she had.

09:19.810 --> 09:20.845
- Okay.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.393
But who knows what Croatoan did to him?

09:24.314 --> 09:25.520
The Duke we knew...

09:26.066 --> 09:27.727
I'm afraid we lost him forever.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.193
- Let's find out.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.178
- You should eat this. You love it.

10:02.853 --> 10:06.186
- I am not your daughter.
I will never be your daughter.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.271
- Family's not a choice.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.984
- How can you talk about family
like it means anything to you?

10:13.071 --> 10:14.777
You kill your family.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.564
You murdered Charlotte.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.032
Your wife.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.620
My mother.

10:20.746 --> 10:23.579
- I loved your mother.
She wasn't destroyed by me.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.243
She was...

10:25.375 --> 10:27.366
contaminated by weak minds.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.161
When she turned against me...

10:31.590 --> 10:32.921
broke my heart.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.130
Then, once she started searching for a cure

10:38.263 --> 10:39.719
for the Troubles...

10:40.349 --> 10:42.305
that could've been
disastrous for both of us.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.049
I couldn't let that happen.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.595
So, I had to make a choice.

10:47.731 --> 10:48.891
(screams)

10:51.276 --> 10:53.767
A very difficult choice.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.780
- No.

10:57.616 --> 11:01.279
You killed James, my son.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.662
- I had to.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.660
That's how much I love you.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.417
lfl hadn't killed him, Lucy would have,

11:11.547 --> 11:14.664
and then all of Mara's work,
your work, would've been undone.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.961
Worse than that, the Barn
would've sent you home,

11:17.094 --> 11:19.756
and I would've lost you forever.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.718
- Do you think that's an excuse?

11:26.728 --> 11:29.765
- Excuses are for people
who regret what they've done.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.436
I don't, because everything I did,
I did for you.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.106
You're everything to me.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.938
I need you to understand that.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.240
Do you?

11:52.254 --> 11:53.835
- I want some coffee.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.124
- I'll get it.

11:55.757 --> 11:56.963
(both): Black.

11:57.092 --> 12:00.334
- See? I knew that.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.964
(ominous music)

12:27.122 --> 12:30.865
- So, who am I talking to right now?
Duke?

12:31.001 --> 12:33.367
- Do | not look like Duke Crocker?

12:33.503 --> 12:35.164
- The one I grew up with?

12:36.006 --> 12:37.621
- Now, why would you say that?

12:38.342 --> 12:39.548
- Your eyes.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.792
They've gone back to normal.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.887
So, whatever Croatoan
did to you, it's wearing off.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.007
(ominous music)

12:49.019 --> 12:50.008
- Boo.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.770
Nothing is wearing off.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.395
This is what I am.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.654
I am the person who took Audrey Parker.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.565
- No.

13:04.701 --> 13:08.159
You are the guy who didn't just kill me
when he had the chance.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.873
Because you remembered who you really are.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.793
You remember Audrey, too?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.085
-ldo.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.215
Mmm...

13:30.978 --> 13:34.220
- I know how much you really care about her.
How much she means to you.

13:35.399 --> 13:39.392
- Shouldn't you be more concerned
with how she feels about me?

13:40.195 --> 13:44.689
We both know that sometimes
Audrey likes the bad boys.

13:46.368 --> 13:50.361
And now that l have found my true self,
well...

13:52.332 --> 13:54.573
we may go all the way this time.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.831
- Well, I'm glad you brought that up.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.588
What happened between
you two in Colorado...

14:06.722 --> 14:08.007
it meant something.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.757
I know it did for her.
I'm sure it did for you, too.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.261
I want you to remember that.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.441
What that felt like.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.808
Remember that moment.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.936
Remember how much Audrey
means to you because,

14:24.448 --> 14:26.609
right now, she needs you.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.697
Please.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.444
Tell me where she is.

14:36.418 --> 14:40.411
(laughs)

14:41.965 --> 14:44.047
- You are pathetic.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.093
Did you really think
that reminding me of kissing

14:48.221 --> 14:51.679
that dead fish would change anything?

14:51.808 --> 14:56.723
This isn't some magical spell
that you can break with the power of love.

14:57.647 --> 15:01.356
This... is what I am.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.853
- I don't believe that.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.947
- It doesn't matter what you believe.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.657
You've already lost.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.484
She's gone.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.204
- We'll find her.
- Good luck.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.709
Croatoan was hiding inside of Dave.

15:22.756 --> 15:23.871
You remember Dave.

15:24.007 --> 15:28.091
Old and bald and knew
every hidden corner of Haven.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.098
(Vince): This is a disaster.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.937
Everything we've done, all our efforts...

15:40.065 --> 15:42.977
undone by a stupid artificial intelligence

15:43.110 --> 15:45.442
that can't remember
what it was programmed to do?

15:45.570 --> 15:48.937
- By that logic, you are now
insulting a malfunctioning--

15:49.074 --> 15:50.689
- Oh, shut up.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.282
Why can't you be more helpful?

15:52.410 --> 15:56.198
You were always full of advice
when it came to getting Mara's incarnations

15:56.331 --> 15:57.537
back into that prison.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.531
- That was by design.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.205
My mission was to ensure
that the Barn performed precisely

16:02.337 --> 16:03.952
as it was supposed to.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.876
Everything I did was in service
of that primary function.

16:07.008 --> 16:10.250
- So then, why can't we just
give you a new primary function?

16:10.387 --> 16:13.470
- I'm notjust a program
you can simply rewrite and reboot.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.346
l was once a man.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.476
- What?

16:24.276 --> 16:28.144
- By your calendar,
it was several centuries ago.

16:30.323 --> 16:34.942
I lived in the same world as Charlotte,
Mara, and her father.

16:36.037 --> 16:39.074
After Mara created the Troubles...

16:39.207 --> 16:41.584
l was the one that captured her.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.575
Brought her to justice.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.419
- And you helped construct her punishment.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.004
Her prison.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.418
- By design, it required a dedicated warden,

16:52.554 --> 16:55.842
one that deeply felt
the need for her punishment.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.924
When I tracked Mara here...

16:59.769 --> 17:02.385
I saw what she had done to those people.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.930
It was a...

17:06.151 --> 17:07.982
a young boy.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.687
The Trouble Mara gave him was...

17:12.407 --> 17:13.863
intolerable.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.157
His life unlivable.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.739
I had to end his suffering.
I had to...

17:23.752 --> 17:26.118
I couldn't let that happen to my family.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.622
- So, you sacrificed yourself
to protect your loved ones.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.749
Your home.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.888
- As I said,

17:36.681 --> 17:38.763
that was centuries ago.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.805
The importance of what I was doing was clear
because it was personal.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.933
But after what happened
in the police station,

17:46.066 --> 17:48.307
after I was compromised, l...

17:50.570 --> 17:52.151
I can't remember them anymore.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.398
- Without that personal connection...

17:57.619 --> 17:59.905
you can't operate the new Barn.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.155
- No.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.330
- That, uh...

18:11.675 --> 18:12.915
that couldn't have been easy.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.749
You okay?

18:15.637 --> 18:16.592
- No.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.921
But it was worth it.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.384
What Duke said about Croatoan
knowing all of Haven's secrets

18:23.520 --> 18:24.885
because he was part of Dave.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.936
We should send someone to talk to Vince.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.226
See if he knows where his brother
would stash a prisoner.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.566
- "Someone" meaning not you?

18:31.695 --> 18:36.029
- Duke is still in there. I know it.
| just need to keep pushing.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.397
- I'll go.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.192
McHugh's on his way in.
He can back you up.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.533
- Dwight, I know you think
that Duke's a lost cause--

18:44.666 --> 18:47.328
- Hey, if anyone can get
through to him, it's you.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.793
You've known each other your whole lives,
maybe that's why he didn't kill you.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.083
And reminding us about Dave,
maybe that's Duke's way

18:53.216 --> 18:55.958
of helping us out
without tipping Croatoan off.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.554
What you're doing...
I think it's working.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.606
- Hey. What needs doing?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.272
- Keep an eye on things in there.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.769
Nathan's making progress but--

19:15.905 --> 19:18.032
- If things go south,
want me to take care of Crocker?

19:18.158 --> 19:19.238
-Ah, well...

19:20.618 --> 19:21.573
No.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.615
No, Nathan's right. Duke's still in there.

19:25.206 --> 19:28.039
Hasn't always gotten along with The Guard,
but he's one of us.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.784
- No man left behind?
- Yeah.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.785
Help Nathan out any way you can, okay?

19:33.923 --> 19:37.051
(dramatic music)

19:41.222 --> 19:42.257
(Croatoan): Here we go.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.767
- You said the Troubles were Mara's... work?

19:47.896 --> 19:49.852
- Yes.
Your work.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.602
Really following in your father's footsteps.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.609
I hope it's not too hot.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.939
(mysterious music)

20:02.535 --> 20:05.902
Oh, Audrey...
I don't want to hurt you.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.074
You're my daughter.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.200
And even if I did, poison?
Not my style.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.535
Yum, yum.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.877
- How could you call the Troubles "work"?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.305
- I understand why they frighten you.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.638
lt's 'cause you're not seeing them clearly.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.887
You're not seeing their full potential,
what they can accomplish.

20:32.023 --> 20:36.232
What you're seeing is the risks,
the damage.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.685
Doesn't have to be that way.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.988
- No... it doesn't.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.617
(both gasp)

20:45.745 --> 20:48.737
(dramatic music)

21:15.817 --> 21:17.227
(arm snaps)
- Ow!

21:17.360 --> 21:19.601
(grunts)

21:30.373 --> 21:33.661
No, please don't.
- I need to teach you a lesson,

21:33.793 --> 21:35.533
but not what you think.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.545
Let's see what we have here.

21:40.341 --> 21:43.048
Snapped clean through.
Must hurt.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.631
But you've always been tough.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.306
Luckily for you,
your father knows what he's doing.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.018
There you are.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.267
As good as new.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.486
(mysterious music)

22:06.242 --> 22:08.028
- How did you do that?

22:08.995 --> 22:10.405
- | used the Troubles.

22:11.915 --> 22:15.248
- You can control the Troubles
that you take from people? You can use them?

22:16.336 --> 22:17.325
- Yes.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.752
- And now Duke is out there
harvesting more for you, isn't he?

22:22.884 --> 22:25.045
- Just the ones I need...

22:25.178 --> 22:26.463
for my protection.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.588
I survived in the Void,

22:30.391 --> 22:31.767
filled with Aether,

22:33.269 --> 22:34.349
for centuries.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.350
- You learned to master the Troubles.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.769
- I wish you'd stop
calling them the Troubles.

22:40.902 --> 22:43.518
They're gifts, and in the right hands...

22:43.655 --> 22:47.489
My hands...
They can accomplish anything.

22:49.827 --> 22:53.115
Today wasn't the first time
you've been my patient.

22:54.123 --> 22:57.707
When you were little girl, | used Aether...

22:59.254 --> 23:00.369
to save your life.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.247
- What?

23:05.843 --> 23:07.424
How?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.886
- I think it's time you heard
my side of the story.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.385
The one your mother
never wanted you to hear.

23:15.186 --> 23:16.642
(Duke): Come back soon.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.439
- How's it going?

23:29.576 --> 23:31.908
- Duke's in there, but it's slow.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.197
- Maybe it's time we try
a different course of action?

23:35.873 --> 23:37.454
That chain you found got me thinking.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.034
Some Guard buddies of mine have old Troubles
that can make Duke talk.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.708
(scoffs)
- Use an old Trouble to torture him?

23:45.174 --> 23:48.007
- I've done a lot of damage
by picking up the enemy's weapon.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.880
- I'll do you one better.
- Let's hear it.

23:54.851 --> 23:58.264
- What if we use an old Trouble
to bring the real Duke back?

23:59.022 --> 24:00.182
- That's good.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.104
And if it works...

24:02.233 --> 24:05.396
we'll have a double agent embedded
right by Croatoan's side.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.070
- Go grab the census of Troubles
we've been putting together.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.904
lt's guarded. Tell them I sent you.

24:11.576 --> 24:14.113
If there is one that can bring
Duke back, it's in there.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.952
- I'm on it.
What are you gonna do?

24:17.081 --> 24:18.196
- Get back in there.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.374
Find that part of Duke I saw and grab on.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.710
Give us a fighting chance.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.591
- We need some help finding Audrey.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.930
Something Duke said
made us think that she's being kept

24:36.059 --> 24:37.424
at one of Dave's old hideouts.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.269
So, lfigured...
- Deserted farmhouse. County Route 19.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.388
On the outskirts of town.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.513
- That was quick.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.984
- It's where we planned to hide out if
things in Haven ever completely fell apart.

24:49.781 --> 24:52.113
Guess we missed our chance.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.419
You foolish old goat.

25:15.598 --> 25:16.838
- Your brother was...

25:17.809 --> 25:18.798
a good man.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.802
- He gave his life for this town.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.979
- And I'm sure you would've done
the same thing.

25:33.574 --> 25:37.283
- You said you aren't able
to operate the new Barn,

25:37.412 --> 25:38.948
but what they did to you,

25:39.539 --> 25:41.825
turning you into the Barn's controller...

25:42.959 --> 25:45.041
Could you do it to someone else?

25:45.962 --> 25:48.920
Could you do it to me?

25:51.759 --> 25:53.966
- Back home, the work l was doing was...

25:54.595 --> 25:57.428
decades ahead of my contemporaries
and light years ahead

25:57.557 --> 26:00.014
of what the minds here have dreamed up.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.634
But, success breeds envy

26:02.770 --> 26:06.137
and eventually the others grew timid.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.477
Afraid of progress.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.146
- They weren't timid.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.689
You were reckless.

26:12.822 --> 26:15.154
Charlotte told me why you were banished.

26:15.867 --> 26:18.950
You were experimenting
with Aether from the Void.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.579
- Bet she didn't tell you why.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.543
When you were a little girl, you were sick.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.333
You were very, very sick.

26:32.884 --> 26:35.216
No cure. No hope of survival.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.209
You were our only child.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.177
We were devastated.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.390
I couldn't let you go.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.686
So, I took a risk and it worked.

26:49.650 --> 26:53.359
I introduced Aether
into your immune system...

26:54.572 --> 26:56.312
to modify your natural antibodies.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.939
| used Aether

26:58.451 --> 27:00.658
to save your life.

27:05.082 --> 27:08.449
- You put Aether into your own daughter?
- Yes!

27:09.337 --> 27:11.328
But it was like
bringing you back from the dead.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.955
The others were willing
to let you go, but not me.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.003
Your mother, she gave birth to you.

27:17.386 --> 27:21.550
But all that you are,
the miracle that you've become,

27:22.016 --> 27:23.631
was all thanks to me.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.638
| created you.

27:27.188 --> 27:28.849
You're my daughter...

27:30.733 --> 27:32.519
twice.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.062
(laughs)

27:38.115 --> 27:39.946
- We'll stay here as long as it takes

27:40.076 --> 27:43.864
because I know
that you're still in there, Duke.

27:44.205 --> 27:47.322
Croatoan's inside your head,
controlling you.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.994
You can force him out.

27:49.126 --> 27:52.493
- You... are wrong.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.583
- Since when do you let someone
tell you what to do?

27:55.967 --> 27:59.084
Don't let him control you.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.586
This isn't you.

28:04.976 --> 28:08.434
(spits)

28:08.563 --> 28:10.724
- Wrong again.

28:12.608 --> 28:16.442
For the first time in my life,
I know exactly who I am.

28:17.655 --> 28:20.692
This is what I was always meant to be.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.618
Please, Nathan...

28:31.252 --> 28:33.117
help me.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.744
- You're fighting him.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.834
What can I do?
How do | help?

28:37.967 --> 28:39.173
- I don't know.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.008
- You can do this.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.002
You can beat him, Duke.
I know you can.

28:44.307 --> 28:45.296
Come on.

28:52.023 --> 28:54.514
- What you did for me...

28:55.860 --> 28:57.976
what you did for your daughter...

29:00.448 --> 29:01.733
it was courageous.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.108
- Had to. Couldn't lose you.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.828
- But it doesn't excuse
what you've done to the people here.

29:10.082 --> 29:14.371
Being in the Void for all of those years,
maybe it... it changed you.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.410
lt corrupted you.

29:16.547 --> 29:19.539
- What I endured in the Void
has only made me stronger.

29:20.217 --> 29:24.426
All those years in that place,
the only thing that kept me going was you.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.672
I survived so I could return to you.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.891
- But at what cost?

29:34.190 --> 29:36.602
The man who would do anything
to save his daughter,

29:36.734 --> 29:39.191
he would hate the person you have become.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.312
- No. I'm the same man l was back then.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.616
Because everything I did was for you.
To get you back.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.533
- I told you.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.116
I am not your daughter.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.201
Mara is dead.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.951
- Names don't matter.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.706
You're still my daughter...

29:59.757 --> 30:00.963
my creation.

30:01.676 --> 30:04.258
And you're still...

30:05.137 --> 30:06.593
special.

30:07.932 --> 30:10.548
I made you that way.
Don't you feel that?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.594
- What you did with the Aether...

30:15.648 --> 30:18.936
You said it made me special.

30:20.403 --> 30:23.486
But, how? Why?

30:28.911 --> 30:30.867
You need me for something.

30:37.545 --> 30:42.414
- All the facility and knowledge
necessary to operate

30:42.550 --> 30:45.758
a new construct are contained
within that controller crystal.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.968
- But creating a new controller,

30:48.097 --> 30:50.884
someone to steer the ship,
as you put it,

30:51.017 --> 30:52.678
that requires...

30:53.936 --> 30:55.176
another sacrifice?

30:56.397 --> 30:57.386
- Yes.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.306
I understand your commitment, but...

31:01.318 --> 31:04.276
biologically, I don't even know
if you would be fit

31:04.405 --> 31:05.941
to serve as the controller.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.314
- You volunteered to serve as Mara's warden

31:08.451 --> 31:10.817
because you knew it was
the only way to protect

31:10.953 --> 31:13.319
the ones you love,
now that was your purpose.

31:13.456 --> 31:14.571
- My dedication was paramount,

31:14.707 --> 31:17.244
but I can make no guarantees
it will work the same for you.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.662
- But I have to try.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.660
l've dedicated my life to Haven.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.667
Leading the Guard for all those years.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.756
Using the Herald to cover up the Troubles.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.002
All of it, because I love this town.

31:30.181 --> 31:32.297
The people here,
I've seen what they've been through.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.849
Witnessed so much suffering.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.263
Lost my...

31:41.734 --> 31:44.146
I've lost so much because of the Troubles.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.312
And now, I can play a part
in ending them...

31:49.533 --> 31:50.488
forever.

31:52.703 --> 31:57.288
- The transformation process to controller
will kill you.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.579
Even if it doesn't succeed.

32:00.711 --> 32:01.666
- So be it.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.546
This is my purpose.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.678
- You can control the Troubles.

32:13.474 --> 32:16.261
You have Duke out there
collecting the ones that you want.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.518
So, why do you need me?

32:22.733 --> 32:26.442
- What I did with the Aether to save Mara...

32:27.738 --> 32:28.693
changed her.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.480
Gave her a special bond with the Aether.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.733
She could do things with it...

32:34.745 --> 32:36.281
nobody else could.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.833
- But, can't you create Troubles on your own?

32:39.959 --> 32:42.746
- Yes, of course,
but they pale in comparison...

32:43.462 --> 32:46.044
to the kind of things she could do.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.711
And now, that singular gift is yours.

32:52.054 --> 32:54.887
- I will never create Troubles for you.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.722
- Why not? You've did it before,
when you touched Duke.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.143
- People were dying.

33:02.565 --> 33:05.932
I did what I had to do.
- Exactly. Just like your father.

33:07.361 --> 33:10.899
- But, why?
Why do you want me to make Troubles?

33:13.075 --> 33:14.781
- Because...

33:16.412 --> 33:18.368
I want to take my daughter
back where she belongs.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.283
I want to take you home.

33:20.416 --> 33:24.079
If you would just embrace what you are,

33:24.211 --> 33:26.327
you could realize your full potential.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.795
You do that, we can create
the Troubles we need,

33:28.924 --> 33:31.631
then we could take back
what's rightfully ours.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.422
Reclaim our home
from those who banished us.

33:35.222 --> 33:39.340
Show them what Aether is truly capable of.

33:39.476 --> 33:40.977
Show them the power

33:41.103 --> 33:43.936
that they were too cowardly
to claim as their own.

33:44.607 --> 33:47.940
And we'll do it together.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.939
Father, daughter.

33:59.747 --> 34:03.581
I'm going to rip open a tear in the Void

34:03.709 --> 34:05.620
and flood this world with Aether.

34:08.339 --> 34:10.421
Welcome to our laboratory.

34:11.342 --> 34:13.082
Oh, Audrey, join me.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.087
You don't belong here.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.931
You can't save these people.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.012
You can't save Haven.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.936
What I have planned...

34:25.522 --> 34:27.183
has already begun.

34:30.361 --> 34:32.522
- Tell me you got something.
- I've been looking through this

34:32.655 --> 34:35.146
Trouble census and you're right.
This thing's a gold mine.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.658
You got psychic communication,

34:36.784 --> 34:38.490
there's a puppet master Trouble.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.452
There's gotta be something
that can break Croatoan's hold over Duke.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.569
- Good work.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.868
Now we just pick our best shot and...

34:48.420 --> 34:49.409
- That's spooky.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.495
He can't hear us in here, can he?

34:54.802 --> 34:55.962
- Yes!

34:57.179 --> 34:58.168
He can.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.631
Thank you for bringing that, McHugh.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.759
(dramatic music)

35:08.065 --> 35:10.101
- How did he...
- Damn it.

35:23.998 --> 35:26.489
(Duke): I'll take that Trouble census now.

35:28.419 --> 35:31.252
- What do you mean, "It's begun"?

35:31.380 --> 35:32.665
What's happening out there?

35:32.798 --> 35:34.129
- Just what I expected.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.089
People are playing their parts perfectly.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.755
Nathan is doing everything he can
to save Duke.

35:38.887 --> 35:43.256
Duke is showing him just enough
of his lost friend to keep hope alive.

35:43.726 --> 35:46.138
Just enough for Nathan to keep Duke close.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.103
And it will cost him.

35:51.233 --> 35:54.225
- What is happening with Nathan?

35:55.571 --> 35:57.778
- This is your big moment.

35:58.949 --> 36:01.235
Will you defend that with your life?

36:06.123 --> 36:07.784
Stay out of this.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.124
- How did you get free?

36:11.253 --> 36:13.585
- Well, now, why go around something

36:13.714 --> 36:17.252
when you can just bust right through it?

36:21.388 --> 36:23.629
So easily fooled.

36:23.766 --> 36:26.473
- Croatoan planned this...

36:27.811 --> 36:30.063
wanted you to get caught.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.979
You faked this all just
so you could get your hands on this.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.481
- That's right. Exactly.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.750
It's like a menu of Troubles.

36:55.422 --> 37:00.166
Now we can just pick
and choose our favorites...

37:00.969 --> 37:02.550
and then drink them up.

37:03.639 --> 37:06.927
We will be unstoppable.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.471
lt's ironic.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.436
All of the times
that you asked me to kill for you.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.351
Look what I have become.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.816
What you turned me into.

37:20.656 --> 37:22.317
You wanted a Crocker?

37:24.118 --> 37:25.449
Well, here I am.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.239
- Please, I am begging you.
Don't kill him.

37:28.372 --> 37:30.954
- Why?
- You don't need to.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.366
If you are as powerful as you say,

37:35.587 --> 37:36.702
it doesn't matter.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.579
Dad...

37:41.677 --> 37:43.258
please.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.169
- Remember this...

37:48.642 --> 37:50.178
It isn't you.

38:12.499 --> 38:12.578
- Please, don't kill him.
- Dove, Dove, Dove. It's all right.

38:12.583 --> 38:17.077
- Please, don't kill him.
- Dove, Dove, Dove. It's all right.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.464
I've decided to let Nathan live.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.048
- Why?

38:24.011 --> 38:25.876
- 'Cause that's what you wanted.

38:27.723 --> 38:31.215
- It doesn't change anything.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.888
I will never help you...

38:34.521 --> 38:36.102
no matter what you do.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.846
- Yes, you will.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.021
And I never really expected

38:41.153 --> 38:43.940
just to talk you into helping me.

38:44.072 --> 38:48.065
No, today was about finding out
what you really care about...

38:48.744 --> 38:49.779
Nathan.

38:49.912 --> 38:55.123
I needed to find out
how much you care about him and the others.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.287
You'd do anything to protect him,
wouldn't you?

38:58.420 --> 39:00.456
- If you hurt them, I swear to you...

39:00.589 --> 39:03.581
- Hurt them? Haven't you been listening?
I'm going to help them.

39:03.717 --> 39:07.630
I'm gonna use all the powers l've gathered
to give them what they truly want.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.129
What you truly want for them.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.181
- What?
- I'm gonna make them happy.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.802
- Is that what you did with Duke?

39:16.939 --> 39:18.475
-We||...

39:18.607 --> 39:22.520
Duke spent his life searching
for his identity. Now, he's found it.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.272
You're free to go.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.915
- Why would you just let me walk out?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.205
- Well, I want you to be with them...
your friends.

39:41.338 --> 39:44.922
I want you to see the gifts I offer,

39:45.050 --> 39:48.338
the happy lives that they can live...

39:49.721 --> 39:53.714
and what you'll be ripping
away from them...

39:55.060 --> 39:56.971
if you still refuse to join me.

41:00.876 --> 41:01.865
- Daddy?

41:11.637 --> 41:12.877
What's wrong, Daddy?

41:13.555 --> 41:14.715
Say something.

41:15.557 --> 41:18.720
- Lizzie? But, you...

41:27.569 --> 41:29.480
(bell dinging)

41:29.613 --> 41:32.821
- Vince? Vince!

41:35.786 --> 41:38.823
Howard,
I need your help finding Vince.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.329
Vince!

41:44.294 --> 41:45.249
Vince?

41:50.967 --> 41:51.922
Oh, my God.

41:55.472 --> 41:56.712
What have you done?

41:56.848 --> 41:58.349
- What I had to.

41:59.601 --> 42:05.471
And I know exactly what we have to do
to send Croatoan screaming back to hell.

42:33.135 --> 42:36.047
