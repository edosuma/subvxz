00:46.112 --> 00:48.748
Now arms out and up.

00:48.780 --> 00:50.482
Out and up.

00:50.515 --> 00:51.850
Good, Blanch!

00:51.884 --> 00:55.154
And up.
Out and up.

00:55.186 --> 00:57.457
Out and up.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.591
And out and up.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.493
And out.
You got it, Estelle!

01:01.527 --> 01:04.328
The wop-wop,
wop-wop.

01:04.361 --> 01:06.099
Wop-wop, wop-wop.

01:06.132 --> 01:08.367
Now shimmy, whoo!
Shimmy!

01:08.400 --> 01:10.403
Shimmy, shimmy.

01:10.436 --> 01:12.705
And bring it home!

01:16.509 --> 01:19.478
Go forth, and get on
with your bad self.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.281
My God.
I'm so late.

01:22.313 --> 01:23.482
Hunter, Hunter,

01:23.516 --> 01:25.151
I need you
to clean up this mess.

01:25.183 --> 01:27.185
Okay, make sure you
put the towels in the wash.

01:27.218 --> 01:28.453
Yes, yes,
got it, got it.

01:28.486 --> 01:29.789
-All right, keys.
-Keys, thank you.

01:29.822 --> 01:31.524
Now, are you gonna
stay in here all night,

01:31.557 --> 01:32.792
or are you gonna go meet
my new dad?

01:32.825 --> 01:34.460
You're really excited

01:34.492 --> 01:36.228
about me going out
on this date, aren't you?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.230
Very, very excited.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.198
I want you to have fun.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.198
No drinking and driving.

01:40.231 --> 01:41.733
Text me
when you get there.

01:41.766 --> 01:44.569
Okay?

01:44.602 --> 01:46.905
Yes.

01:46.938 --> 01:48.473
And remember,
don't use Windex...

01:48.507 --> 01:50.343
On the bar, got it.

01:50.376 --> 01:51.611
Okay.

01:53.846 --> 01:55.481
Okay.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.460
Hey, hey, hey,
no spilling.

02:07.492 --> 02:11.463
Watch what
you're doing, man.

02:11.497 --> 02:13.933
Yo, I thought you said
only a few people, man.

02:13.966 --> 02:15.433
What's going on?

02:15.467 --> 02:16.569
Yo, what are you
talking about, man?

02:16.602 --> 02:17.569
This is a few people.

02:17.603 --> 02:18.838
No, it's not, man.

02:18.871 --> 02:20.406
Okay, look,
I mentioned it to Mia,

02:20.438 --> 02:21.774
and she told Mya.

02:21.806 --> 02:24.242
And by the way,
Mya got a thing for you, bro.

02:24.276 --> 02:25.378
I'm just saying.

02:25.411 --> 02:26.611
She totally does.

02:26.645 --> 02:28.381
She talks about you
all the time.

02:28.413 --> 02:29.881
It's actually
kind of annoying.

02:29.914 --> 02:30.882
It's annoying.

02:30.915 --> 02:32.251
You know what, man, look.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.618
You throwing
this party right here?

02:33.651 --> 02:34.887
This is huge, a'right?

02:34.919 --> 02:36.288
Yeah.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.689
Kicking off
the summer right.

02:37.723 --> 02:39.659
It's gonna be
the best three months.

02:40.992 --> 02:42.627
Hey, Hunter.

02:42.661 --> 02:45.264
This party's rad.

02:45.296 --> 02:46.598
Okay. Go, Mya!

02:46.632 --> 02:48.433
Are you allowed
to have parties here?

02:48.467 --> 02:49.669
Come on, dance.

02:49.701 --> 02:51.336
I don't really dance.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.206
Dancing's not my thing.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.274
All right, we're
just gonna...

02:55.306 --> 02:56.641
-What's up, asshole?
-Hey, man, you got a problem?

02:58.676 --> 03:00.545
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, man, what's going on?

03:04.449 --> 03:08.787
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight...

03:08.820 --> 03:09.989
No.

03:10.021 --> 03:10.989
No!

03:11.022 --> 03:12.324
Stop!

03:19.264 --> 03:22.267
So, which one of you
threw the party?

03:25.336 --> 03:27.539
I did.

03:32.844 --> 03:33.979
So sorry I'm late.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.348
I had to bust it
over to BB's

03:35.381 --> 03:37.717
before the breakfast ended.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.819
Let's get to adjudicating.

03:42.554 --> 03:43.823
Smooth.

03:48.661 --> 03:53.498
All right,
what's happening here?

03:53.532 --> 03:55.301
Disturbing the peace,

03:55.334 --> 03:57.003
destruction
of private property,

03:57.036 --> 04:00.406
underage drinking.

04:00.438 --> 04:02.307
What do you got to say
for yourself, son?

04:02.341 --> 04:05.811
Well, your honor, I...

04:05.843 --> 04:08.480
I didn't do
most of those things.

04:08.514 --> 04:09.949
My friends did.

04:09.981 --> 04:11.550
But I took one drink,

04:11.582 --> 04:15.288
which I'm incredibly sorry for.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.689
Coolio.

04:16.721 --> 04:17.721
And well said.

04:17.755 --> 04:18.723
You seem like a good kid.

04:18.757 --> 04:19.725
Nice suit.

04:19.757 --> 04:21.493
Good job, Mom.

04:21.526 --> 04:23.795
That's why I'm only
gonna give you 100 hours.

04:23.829 --> 04:25.497
What?

04:25.531 --> 04:27.667
Sir, 100 hours of jail time
seems a bit steep.

04:27.699 --> 04:29.801
100 hours...

04:29.834 --> 04:32.637
of community service.

04:32.670 --> 04:37.610
Mom, I want you to decide
where he serves those hours.

04:37.642 --> 04:40.478
You know that old
choreographer of mine?

04:40.512 --> 04:42.781
He runs a camp up north.

04:42.814 --> 04:44.617
No, no.

04:44.649 --> 04:45.884
You can't make me do that.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.687
She can't make me do that,
right?

04:48.721 --> 04:49.954
Great.

04:49.987 --> 04:51.324
I'm good.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.992
That happened real fast.

04:53.024 --> 04:55.394
I'm fine, and I'm okay.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.615
Please don't
make me do this.

05:16.648 --> 05:17.917
Doing your hours
at the rec center

05:17.949 --> 05:21.420
is not gonna keep you away
from those boys.

05:21.452 --> 05:25.024
-They're not that bad.
-They're not that good either.

05:36.769 --> 05:40.372
This is...
This is gonna be so horrible.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.942
Mom, Ivan's that guy
who threw a shoe at me, right?

05:43.975 --> 05:46.077
He's eccentric.

05:46.110 --> 05:49.014
You know, it's actually a
compliment where he comes from.

05:49.047 --> 05:50.549
I was 6, okay?

05:50.581 --> 05:52.617
That was very scarring
for me, all right?

05:52.651 --> 05:54.920
You're leaving me in the hands
of a known child abuser.

05:54.952 --> 05:57.522
Would you stop?

06:00.526 --> 06:03.562
Mini James Brown!

06:03.595 --> 06:04.997
Ivan.

06:05.029 --> 06:07.132
Me, me.

06:07.165 --> 06:08.701
Wa-wa...

06:08.733 --> 06:10.402
Okay, all right.

06:10.435 --> 06:11.436
It's gross.

06:11.470 --> 06:13.672
It's very... stop.

06:15.072 --> 06:16.709
Mini James.

06:16.742 --> 06:18.576
Why do you keep calling me
Mini James?

06:18.610 --> 06:20.579
-You don't remember?
-What?

06:20.612 --> 06:22.848
-He doesn't remember?
-No.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.616
You will remember.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.017
You will remember.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.786
All right, well,
here's my time sheet.

06:27.819 --> 06:29.889
You just have to sign off
my community service hours,

06:29.922 --> 06:31.824
and I get to go back
to Planet Earth.

06:31.857 --> 06:33.058
Hunter.

06:33.091 --> 06:34.627
You still go that wit.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.728
You still got
that wit.

06:35.761 --> 06:37.096
Come on.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.730
Why don't we just
go take a tour, come on.

06:40.165 --> 06:41.600
Mom, Mom, Mom, no.

06:41.632 --> 06:43.935
This is the drop point.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.704
This is where you cut the cord.

06:45.737 --> 06:47.106
Right, of course.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.841
I love you.

06:48.874 --> 06:50.509
-Love you too.
-It's gonna be good, okay?

06:50.541 --> 06:51.543
All right.

06:51.576 --> 06:52.545
Call you.

06:52.577 --> 06:54.679
It's gonna be all right.

06:54.713 --> 06:55.948
All right.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.050
Here, you can be
whatever you want to be.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.919
I started this place
25 years ago.

06:59.951 --> 07:02.120
I've been producing
the best dancers in the country.

07:02.153 --> 07:04.189
Music videos, film, TV.

07:04.223 --> 07:05.990
You name it, we got it.

07:06.024 --> 07:08.661
Welcome to Dance Camp.

07:08.694 --> 07:09.829
Mess hall
is down over there.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.129
Cabins are over there.

07:11.163 --> 07:13.732
We got basketball courts,
pool... yes!

07:13.764 --> 07:16.168
We got all
sorts of crews here.

07:16.201 --> 07:18.637
You name it,
we got it.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.773
Nice job, Kelsey.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.009
Watch out.

07:25.043 --> 07:26.679
Out of my way, fool.

07:26.711 --> 07:28.213
We got the YOLOs over here.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.949
Those are some
of our youngest crews.

07:29.982 --> 07:32.151
They've been here
for two years now,

07:32.184 --> 07:33.686
and look,
they are sharp, sharp.

07:33.718 --> 07:34.687
Good job, girls.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.156
Snap it, snap it.

07:37.189 --> 07:38.591
Come on, girls.
Get into it.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.126
Get into it.
Get those arms up.

07:41.158 --> 07:43.028
Nice.

07:43.060 --> 07:45.563
Listen, Hunter, I don't want
you to be shy, okay?

07:45.596 --> 07:47.165
If you want to
take some dance classes,

07:47.199 --> 07:50.035
hip-hop, crunking, jazz,
anything you want,

07:50.067 --> 07:51.736
if you want to practice
a new move,

07:51.769 --> 07:53.204
you go, you book out
some time.

07:53.237 --> 07:54.973
This is the place.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.610
I want you to reconnect
with the dancer inside of you.

07:57.642 --> 08:00.745
I don't have a dancer
inside of me.

08:00.778 --> 08:02.148
That is creepy.

08:08.286 --> 08:11.089
Young ladies, chill!
No autographs here.

08:11.122 --> 08:13.224
Ladies, ladies,
I'm sorry.

08:13.257 --> 08:15.060
All right, all right,
all right.

08:15.093 --> 08:16.562
You guys want a little Lance?

08:16.595 --> 08:19.164
I'll give you a little Lance.

08:25.571 --> 08:29.542
#WhosReady4Camp?

08:31.242 --> 08:32.945
That's right, that's right.

08:32.977 --> 08:34.011
Hey, an autograph.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.147
Look, sorry, bro.

08:35.179 --> 08:36.813
I'm just a regular guy
like you.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.883
No autographs here.

08:38.917 --> 08:41.186
And that is Lance.

08:41.219 --> 08:43.956
He's pretty much a legend
around here.

08:43.989 --> 08:45.758
Legend of Dance.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.593
See, if you want to be
in the Legend of Dance,

08:47.625 --> 08:49.827
you got to have
a really tight crew.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.896
Right, yeah,
none of those sentences

08:51.929 --> 08:53.698
have any meaning to me.

08:53.731 --> 08:55.967
You see,
every summer around here,

08:56.999 --> 08:59.971
all the crews get together
and compete to be legends,

09:00.004 --> 09:00.972
Legends of...

09:01.005 --> 09:03.107
Dance, right, I get it.

09:03.140 --> 09:06.177
You are good,
you are good.

09:06.211 --> 09:08.279
So we've got you
in the Moonwalk cabin,

09:08.312 --> 09:10.182
right there.

09:10.215 --> 09:13.319
It is even more fun than
you could possibly imagine.

09:13.351 --> 09:15.086
No, no, listen.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.956
Look, I'll just find my own
little cabin or area.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.259
I'm not a part of these dancers
or campers, obviously.

09:23.061 --> 09:24.797
You're so funny.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.599
You're gonna love it here.

09:26.631 --> 09:28.266
You know what I'm gonna
love more, Ivan,

09:28.299 --> 09:33.237
is getting my hours signed and
getting the hell out of here.

10:06.738 --> 10:09.808
No, I'm...
No, I'm cool.

10:09.841 --> 10:11.043
I'm good.

10:11.076 --> 10:13.879
You guys keep pretending
to be robots.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.124
Okay.
Okay, they're pretty cool.

10:34.732 --> 10:36.134
Yeah, that's my butt.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.970
What? No.

10:38.003 --> 10:40.105
I wasn't looking
at your butt, no.

10:40.138 --> 10:41.706
I was...

10:41.740 --> 10:44.743
I was checking out your form.

10:44.775 --> 10:46.010
Which is great.

10:46.043 --> 10:47.646
Great form work.

10:50.881 --> 10:52.350
I'm gonna go to my cabin.

10:57.422 --> 10:59.057
Okay.

11:07.298 --> 11:09.201
Don't take another step,
muchache.

11:09.234 --> 11:11.437
I'm gonna have to kill you,
all right?

11:11.470 --> 11:12.437
I'm just kidding.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.739
I won't kill you, okay?

11:13.772 --> 11:14.840
Hey, look, there's two rules

11:14.873 --> 11:15.974
here at the Moonwalk cabin.

11:16.006 --> 11:17.308
Rule number one:

11:17.341 --> 11:19.278
I'm gonna need you to shower
every day, okay?

11:19.311 --> 11:20.278
No stinkies.

11:20.312 --> 11:21.813
And if you don't,

11:21.846 --> 11:23.148
I'm gonna get in there
with a loofah,

11:23.181 --> 11:25.084
I'm gonna wash your gooch,
all right?

11:25.116 --> 11:27.019
Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

11:27.052 --> 11:29.021
Okay, rule number two:

11:29.053 --> 11:30.389
anytime you enter
and exit the cabin,

11:30.422 --> 11:31.923
I'm gonna need you
to do a moonwalk.

11:33.524 --> 11:36.127
Okay, now, that's a dance
hazing thing, isn't it,

11:36.160 --> 11:38.329
where I moonwalk
and everyone laughs at me

11:38.363 --> 11:40.265
because I'm the dumb one
to believe it, right?

11:40.298 --> 11:42.301
Comprende, muchache,
all right?

11:42.333 --> 11:44.936
The thing is, muchacho,

11:44.970 --> 11:46.471
I'm not really a camper.

11:46.504 --> 11:48.373
I'm just here for community
service, all right?

11:48.405 --> 11:49.974
No, muchacho, okay?

11:50.008 --> 11:51.310
Look, I'm gonna need you
to follow the rules,

11:51.342 --> 11:52.844
'cause rules are rules.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.314
So let's pip you back there,
okay?

11:55.346 --> 11:57.783
Hey, how's it going?

11:57.816 --> 11:58.884
Thank you.

11:58.917 --> 11:59.951
It's nice, see?

11:59.985 --> 12:03.020
It's real nice.

12:03.053 --> 12:04.490
Come on, let's feel it out.

12:04.523 --> 12:05.990
It'll be fun;
do it with me.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.194
Just kind of want
to feel it, my hombre.

12:09.226 --> 12:10.895
We all got M.J.
in our heart.

12:10.928 --> 12:13.798
You just got to make sure
he's right there with you.

12:13.831 --> 12:15.366
That's the spirit,
my man.

12:15.399 --> 12:18.069
-Come on in!
-No.

12:18.102 --> 12:19.471
Okay. It's okay.
Hey, you know what?

12:19.504 --> 12:21.105
We're gonna work
on those dance moves.

12:21.139 --> 12:22.441
We got a long time
to see it.

12:22.474 --> 12:23.475
I am Dougie.

12:23.508 --> 12:24.777
I am your counselor.

12:24.809 --> 12:26.110
This is my bunk.

12:26.144 --> 12:28.514
I do a little dancing
on the side myself?

12:31.283 --> 12:32.518
And in the wind, you know?

12:32.551 --> 12:33.951
And he's got the open...

12:39.857 --> 12:42.393
All right, cool, let's show you
around the cabin, okay?

12:42.427 --> 12:43.995
We got the mailbox
over there

12:44.028 --> 12:46.197
if you want to talk
to Mom-Mom and Pip-Pip.

12:46.230 --> 12:48.399
Keep a secret candy stash
back there.

12:48.432 --> 12:50.134
Through the door
are the restrooms.

12:50.168 --> 12:53.038
And here, the piece
a la resistance,

12:53.071 --> 12:54.339
is your bunk,

12:54.371 --> 12:56.440
complete with a bunkmate.

12:56.474 --> 12:57.576
This is Jebediah,

12:57.609 --> 12:59.177
but the word on the street is,

12:59.211 --> 13:00.979
is the kids
like to call him Jeb.

13:01.011 --> 13:02.880
Hey, Jebby, why don't you
hop on down

13:02.913 --> 13:05.384
and see your bunkmate Hunter?

13:05.417 --> 13:06.985
What did I say
about playing games?

13:07.018 --> 13:08.521
Have fun, boys.

13:11.556 --> 13:12.958
You're my new bunkmate?

13:12.990 --> 13:14.359
Hi.

13:14.392 --> 13:16.395
Before you say anything,
I need you to fill out this.

13:16.427 --> 13:17.895
This is a bunkmate
questionnaire.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.030
So it's got
your medical history,

13:19.063 --> 13:20.565
preferred bedtime,

13:20.599 --> 13:22.033
the way you like your s'mores,
dietary needs...

13:22.067 --> 13:23.534
Yeah, no.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.571
I'm not gonna
fill this out.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.844
Ballsy,
coming in hot.

13:31.876 --> 13:33.211
I like that,
I like you.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.148
What is this, like,
your first camp or something?

13:36.181 --> 13:37.950
My gosh, is it?

13:37.982 --> 13:39.116
Yeah.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.117
Yeah?

13:40.150 --> 13:41.886
My gosh.

13:41.919 --> 13:45.323
Well, it looks like we got
a noob situation over here.

13:45.356 --> 13:46.958
Boys!

13:46.991 --> 13:49.627
Hey, hey, no, I'm actually
not here to dance.

13:49.660 --> 13:50.928
I know.

13:50.961 --> 13:51.963
I can read it
all over your face.

13:51.996 --> 13:53.164
You got classic noob face.

13:53.197 --> 13:54.600
Face of a noob,
noob face.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.033
Face of a noob
is what you've got.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.336
-Okay, all right.
-Yeah.

13:57.369 --> 13:58.637
Well, let me
break it down for you.

13:58.669 --> 14:00.504
The bunkmate relationship
is the cornerstone

14:00.538 --> 14:02.106
of a positive
camp experience.

14:02.139 --> 14:03.942
We got to know each other
better than we know ourselves,

14:03.975 --> 14:05.444
upside-down
and inside-out.

14:05.476 --> 14:09.047
Yeah, I definitely
don't want to know you

14:09.080 --> 14:11.115
inside-out
or upside-down.

14:11.149 --> 14:12.484
Well, I've already
filled mine out,

14:12.517 --> 14:14.552
so you're gonna.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.355
And, hey, listen.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.190
Don't worry,
I got your back.

14:18.222 --> 14:20.224
I'm what they call
a camp pro.

14:20.258 --> 14:22.127
I start out every summer
at astronaut camp

14:22.159 --> 14:23.528
until it's... tchk... over.

14:23.561 --> 14:26.064
Then I'm off to math camp
and SAT prep camp.

14:26.096 --> 14:28.199
Then it's to Jewish camp,
though I'm only half-Jewish,

14:28.232 --> 14:30.134
so they only let me go
for half the time.

14:30.168 --> 14:31.370
After aeronautics camp,

14:31.403 --> 14:32.937
I would usually
go to robotics camp,

14:32.971 --> 14:34.472
but until
the technology's there,

14:34.505 --> 14:36.975
it's basically
like glorified K'nex, you know?

14:37.008 --> 14:39.110
Then I went to Phat Camp,
but with a "P-H."

14:39.144 --> 14:41.446
I learned to rap
like the Notorious BGI.

14:41.479 --> 14:43.081
Football camp!

14:43.114 --> 14:44.383
Fantasy football.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.951
But still!

14:45.984 --> 14:48.086
Consumer electronics camp,
video game camp.

14:48.119 --> 14:51.523
By the way,
have you played "DDR?"

14:51.556 --> 14:53.425
Hunter, "DDR,"
"Dance Dance Revolution."

14:53.457 --> 14:54.927
Have we not talked about this?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.427
My gosh,
you're gonna freak.

14:56.461 --> 14:57.629
I have video.

14:59.163 --> 15:01.198
There are these guys
in Russia.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.434
They're the all time
"DDR" champion...

15:03.467 --> 15:04.435
Hunter?

15:06.171 --> 15:07.973
No.

15:08.005 --> 15:12.144
<i>Hello, hello, hello,
dance camp campers.</i>

15:12.177 --> 15:15.480
So excited to see
you all settling in.

15:15.513 --> 15:19.216
It's gonna be a great year
this year.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.086
<i>So most of you
have probably picked</i>

15:22.120 --> 15:25.057
<i>your Legends of Dance teams.</i>

15:25.090 --> 15:26.557
<i>Please...</i>

15:26.591 --> 15:33.465
do not forget to get in touch
with the team captains.

15:33.498 --> 15:35.200
Yeah!

17:35.353 --> 17:36.555
Just...

17:36.587 --> 17:39.657
just cleaning up here,
you know.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.527
Right.

17:46.798 --> 17:49.166
We have rehearsal
in here.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.735
Hunter!

17:50.768 --> 17:52.370
I didn't know
you were on this team.

17:52.403 --> 17:53.739
I'm not.

17:55.405 --> 17:56.774
Cheyenne, this is Hunter.

17:56.807 --> 17:58.710
I heard about him.

17:58.742 --> 18:01.812
He's just doing some type
of community service.

18:01.846 --> 18:03.615
He's not here as a dancer.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.317
So are you saying
that you're into bad boys?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.520
How does that make sense?

18:08.553 --> 18:14.226
'Cause... bad boys do...
community service.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.759
I'm not into anyone.

18:15.792 --> 18:16.760
I'm here to dance,

18:16.794 --> 18:20.332
and I'm here to win.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.267
Are you guys flirting?

18:22.299 --> 18:23.601
Is that what this is?

18:23.634 --> 18:25.804
I mean, maybe not,
because it's so awkward,

18:25.836 --> 18:30.275
but, well, maybe that's
what flirting is.

18:30.307 --> 18:32.844
Alex, hey.

18:32.876 --> 18:35.680
Hunter, this is Alex.

18:35.712 --> 18:37.281
We go way back.

18:37.315 --> 18:39.217
He's deaf,
but he lip-reads very well,

18:39.250 --> 18:41.153
and also I can sign for you,

18:41.185 --> 18:42.920
'cause let's just say
he's taught me a thing or two

18:42.953 --> 18:45.723
about the language of sign.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.192
What's up, man?

18:52.396 --> 18:53.697
Deaf sister?

18:53.730 --> 18:55.400
No, no, no.

19:00.805 --> 19:02.841
But you know you're
at dance camp, right?

19:06.411 --> 19:08.680
Okay.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.281
Okay, wait, okay, guys.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.618
Slow down there, slow down,
'cause...

19:20.825 --> 19:23.562
Okay, dance is about
being on time,

19:23.595 --> 19:24.828
so that's what I expect
from you.

19:24.862 --> 19:26.331
Come on.

19:26.364 --> 19:27.766
Kenton, leave your skates
at the door.

19:27.798 --> 19:29.567
Gather around.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.437
Right, whoever has
the stress ball

19:32.470 --> 19:34.806
says their name
and their favorite dance style.

19:34.838 --> 19:39.410
Cheyenne, hip-hop.

19:39.443 --> 19:41.445
Yo, I'm Emily.

19:41.479 --> 19:43.949
Ballet, I guess.

19:43.981 --> 19:44.982
Kenton.

19:45.016 --> 19:47.319
I jam-skate.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.787
Sanjana.

19:48.819 --> 19:51.222
I like modern.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.490
I can also do some kathak,

19:52.522 --> 19:54.458
but, like,
not as good as my parents.

19:54.491 --> 19:56.595
My parents actually met
at a dance school in India.

19:56.627 --> 19:58.362
I've only been there once,

19:58.395 --> 20:00.298
but that's because my dad
got in a fight with his brother,

20:00.330 --> 20:01.899
and he's all, "I'm not going
back till he apologizes,"

20:01.932 --> 20:03.768
which will never happen...

20:03.800 --> 20:05.403
Let's keep it moving so we
actually have time to dance.

20:05.435 --> 20:06.804
Totally understand
what you're saying.

20:06.837 --> 20:08.572
Sometimes I have this tendency
to ramble.

20:08.605 --> 20:11.609
-Pass the ball.
-Right.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.345
So my name's Vanessa.

20:13.377 --> 20:14.846
What's you're favorite style?

20:14.878 --> 20:16.780
Honestly, for me,
I'm all about that krump.

20:16.814 --> 20:18.550
Skating.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.384
I like animatum.

20:20.417 --> 20:23.454
I literally love hip-hop,
like Cheyenne.

20:23.488 --> 20:26.024
My favorite dance style
would be...

20:26.057 --> 20:27.025
dancing.

20:27.057 --> 20:28.626
Like, getting nasty and shit.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.295
Hell yeah.

20:30.327 --> 20:32.297
Well, you know "DDR,"
"Dance Dance Revolution?"

20:32.329 --> 20:34.365
I pretty much crush at that,
so...

20:34.398 --> 20:35.399
Pass the ball, Jeb.

20:35.432 --> 20:36.701
Yep, yeah, cool.

20:45.942 --> 20:47.746
Hunter Portis.

20:47.778 --> 20:49.614
Zumba master.

20:51.848 --> 20:53.652
Okay, focus.

20:53.684 --> 20:55.519
We need to pick a team name.

20:55.553 --> 20:58.923
So, to save time,
I've thought of one already.

20:58.955 --> 21:01.825
From now on,
we'll be known as...

21:01.858 --> 21:05.730
the Dark Shadows.

21:05.762 --> 21:07.331
What about
Generation Dance?

21:09.901 --> 21:11.903
Or how about
the Glitter Ponies?

21:11.935 --> 21:13.771
I, for one,
love Cheyenne's idea.

21:13.805 --> 21:15.807
Okay, then it's settled.

21:18.608 --> 21:21.679
You got something to say?

21:21.712 --> 21:23.514
Okay, now, you can totally
shut me up,

21:23.548 --> 21:24.915
cut me off, whatever.

21:24.949 --> 21:27.786
I'm not a part
of your little squad.

21:27.818 --> 21:31.690
But why don't you just go
with what was on your sign?

21:31.722 --> 21:32.990
'Cause that makes no sense.

21:33.023 --> 21:36.060
It said TBD,
"to be determined."

21:36.094 --> 21:37.095
Right, yeah.

21:37.127 --> 21:39.463
It could mean To Be Dancers.

21:39.497 --> 21:42.567
It could mean
Tough Bitches Dancing.

21:42.599 --> 21:43.801
I like that.

21:43.835 --> 21:45.769
It's mysterious,
so it fits my brand.

21:45.803 --> 21:48.039
Yeah, I like that last one,
the bitches one.

21:48.071 --> 21:50.375
Okay, fine, whatever.

21:50.407 --> 21:53.377
We're TBD, okay?

21:53.411 --> 21:54.412
Now let's get to work.

21:54.444 --> 21:55.980
Come on, everybody up.

21:56.012 --> 21:59.016
We only have a week until we
face off against Flow Nation.

21:59.049 --> 22:01.118
This week's theme
is "Breaking Out."

22:01.152 --> 22:02.921
Let's see what I'm working with.

22:02.953 --> 22:05.557
Okay, so we're gonna go,
slide to the right,

22:05.589 --> 22:07.725
spin, punch to the left.

22:08.893 --> 22:10.828
Really?

22:10.862 --> 22:12.096
Right now?

22:12.130 --> 22:13.699
You have to be doing that
right now?

22:19.537 --> 22:20.572
You guys try.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.507
Five, six, seven, eight.

22:45.797 --> 22:46.998
Yeah!

22:48.566 --> 22:51.135
Baby, baby, baby!

22:53.203 --> 22:55.072
What the shit, bro?

22:55.105 --> 22:56.473
My gosh.

22:56.507 --> 22:58.076
Lance, I'm sorry.

22:58.108 --> 22:59.843
I didn't mean to...

22:59.876 --> 23:02.012
I see
what's going on here.

23:02.046 --> 23:04.082
Cheyenne put you
up to this, didn't she?

23:04.115 --> 23:05.083
What?

23:06.150 --> 23:08.519
Hey, man,
chill out, bro.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.789
I guess since Cheyenne
can't beat me fair and square,

23:10.821 --> 23:12.956
she's got to try
and take me out instead.

23:12.990 --> 23:14.793
Yeah, yeah.

23:14.826 --> 23:17.461
Cheyenne, yeah,
she sent Jeb out here

23:17.494 --> 23:19.430
to play "DDR"
to take you out.

23:19.463 --> 23:22.032
Yeah, that's what
I just said, bro.

23:22.066 --> 23:24.469
I just said that.

23:24.501 --> 23:25.869
Okay, I see the problem.

23:25.903 --> 23:28.839
You don't understand
what sarcasm is, do you?

23:28.873 --> 23:32.076
I'm pretty sure
I know what sarcasm is.

23:32.108 --> 23:33.477
Right, guys?

23:33.510 --> 23:35.078
-Yeah.
-He knows what sarcasm is.

23:35.112 --> 23:36.548
See?

23:36.580 --> 23:38.582
I know what sarcasm is,
Hunter, clearly.

23:38.615 --> 23:40.751
But since you're new here,
I'll fill you in a little bit.

23:40.785 --> 23:42.220
This isn't the first time

23:42.252 --> 23:43.788
that someone's tried
to take me out.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.190
I live my whole life
with a target on my back.

23:46.223 --> 23:49.927
So I suggest all three of you
get out of here

23:49.961 --> 23:51.829
before I whoop
all of your asses.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.163
Hunter, come on,
let's just go.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.671
You're, by far,

23:59.703 --> 24:02.807
the weirdest dude
I've ever met in my life.

24:02.839 --> 24:04.641
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:04.674 --> 24:07.644
Well, you're the worst dancer
I've ever met.

24:07.678 --> 24:08.646
Boom!

24:08.679 --> 24:09.781
Sarcasm!

24:11.082 --> 24:12.050
That's not really sar...

24:12.083 --> 24:13.918
Hey, shut up, bro.

24:13.951 --> 24:15.653
Look, me and you,

24:15.685 --> 24:19.656
right here, right now.

24:19.690 --> 24:22.125
Bro, look,
I'm not fighting you, okay?

24:22.159 --> 24:24.262
The only thing lamer
than being at dance camp

24:24.295 --> 24:26.998
is getting into a fight
at dance camp.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.166
No more talky-talky.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.134
Your finger's
on my face.

24:31.167 --> 24:32.971
What are you
gonna do about it?

24:33.003 --> 24:34.972
Snap.

24:37.974 --> 24:39.042
What's with the headband?

24:39.076 --> 24:40.479
It's part of it.

24:48.752 --> 24:51.889
-Back up!
-Back up!

24:51.923 --> 24:54.592
Back up, son.

24:54.625 --> 24:57.261
Welcome to Lance Camp,
bitch.

25:01.065 --> 25:02.567
It's just ironic,

25:02.599 --> 25:04.735
'cause you just
put that paint on, and now...

25:04.769 --> 25:06.104
-Shut up.
-Sorry.

25:06.136 --> 25:07.538
I just thought
I would point out

25:07.571 --> 25:08.939
the dramatic irony
of the moment.

25:08.972 --> 25:10.240
Like, you couldn't
have written it better.

25:23.587 --> 25:25.722
Jeb.

25:25.756 --> 25:27.592
That thing have
a silencer on it?

25:30.126 --> 25:31.796
Done and done.

25:31.828 --> 25:33.830
Nothing like a good nebulizer
treatment before bed

25:33.864 --> 25:36.668
to help you fall asleep.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.836
One wise whistling wizard.

25:38.868 --> 25:40.637
Two tooting tuba tunas.

25:40.671 --> 25:42.574
Three twirly tricky tree toads.

25:42.606 --> 25:44.341
Four fresh French flamingoes.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.742
Five freezing fleeing...

25:45.776 --> 25:48.211
What are you saying?

25:48.244 --> 25:50.147
These are
my vocal exercises.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.616
I have to do them every night
before bed for dialect camp.

25:52.650 --> 25:53.851
It's in just two months.

25:53.884 --> 25:55.819
Why?
Does it bother you?

25:58.923 --> 26:00.090
No.

26:00.124 --> 26:01.660
It's wonderful.

26:05.061 --> 26:07.598
Hunter, are you still upset

26:07.632 --> 26:10.234
because Lance pushed you
in the paint bench today?

26:10.267 --> 26:12.202
I feel like it's
a double-edged sword,

26:12.236 --> 26:13.705
because on the one hand, yes,

26:13.738 --> 26:15.073
Lance pushed you
on a paint bench,

26:15.105 --> 26:16.974
and everyone laughed,
and it was embarrassing.

26:17.008 --> 26:18.276
But, on the other hand,

26:18.308 --> 26:19.844
Lance is an Internet celebrity.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.046
Like, getting seen with him
in any context

26:22.078 --> 26:24.781
is good for your
online persona.

26:24.815 --> 26:27.085
What do you think?

26:27.117 --> 26:29.252
I got an idea.

26:29.286 --> 26:32.789
I like ideas.

26:32.823 --> 26:34.092
Wake up Alex.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.028
My gosh.
I feel like a spy.

26:37.060 --> 26:38.762
I feel like a lamb spy.

26:49.105 --> 26:50.741
<i># Sneaking around #</i>

26:50.775 --> 26:52.877
<i># Here we go,
sneak, sneak, sneak #</i>

26:52.910 --> 26:55.346
<i># Sneaking, sneaking,
sneaking around #</i>

26:55.378 --> 26:56.380
What's up, YouTube?

26:56.413 --> 26:57.382
It's Lance.

26:57.414 --> 26:58.750
Just Lance.

26:58.782 --> 26:59.817
Kidding.

26:59.849 --> 27:01.318
But seriously, it's just Lance.

27:01.352 --> 27:03.086
And today we're coming
at you live from E=MC

27:03.119 --> 27:04.888
"we don't really need
to do math

27:04.922 --> 27:06.891
because we're really good
dancers" Squared cabin

27:06.923 --> 27:08.326
at Dance World.

27:08.358 --> 27:09.693
And today, you know what?

27:09.727 --> 27:10.928
I'm gonna be answering questions

27:10.961 --> 27:16.166
from my 133,256 followers.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.703
First up, Chron85.

27:19.737 --> 27:22.940
Come on.
Stay down.

27:22.972 --> 27:24.808
All right.

27:24.842 --> 27:27.245
"Lance, do you ever feel like
you have a target on your back?"

27:27.278 --> 27:29.212
That's actually
a very important question,

27:29.246 --> 27:30.848
and probably one
of the best questions

27:30.881 --> 27:32.383
that anyone has ever asked me.

27:32.415 --> 27:34.085
And the answer is yes.

27:34.117 --> 27:35.252
I can't believe
I get to be a part of this.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.255
This is a camp classic!

27:37.288 --> 27:40.324
All day, every day,

27:40.356 --> 27:42.192
365 days of the year.

27:46.230 --> 27:49.733
And, yes, there were talks
between the Bieb's team and I

27:49.767 --> 27:51.068
about me becoming
a backup dancer,

27:51.102 --> 27:54.172
but I said, "Look, Justin,
look, Scooter,

27:54.204 --> 27:55.939
I got to stay in school."

27:55.972 --> 27:58.175
-What are we doing?
-We're gonna smoke him out.

27:59.343 --> 28:00.778
That's what I decided to do.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.312
So #stayinskool, #...

28:03.413 --> 28:04.382
Is that...

28:08.318 --> 28:09.353
Get me out of here!

28:09.385 --> 28:11.254
Come on!

28:11.288 --> 28:13.257
#Revenge.

28:13.289 --> 28:15.192
Let's jam.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.095
Sacrifice your body!

28:17.127 --> 28:18.395
Get me out!

28:18.429 --> 28:19.497
Sacrifice yourself!

28:19.529 --> 28:23.734
On three,
one, two, three.

28:28.038 --> 28:30.141
<i>Is that-!</i>

28:30.173 --> 28:32.876
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

28:32.910 --> 28:34.446
<i>Sacrifice your body!</i>

28:37.248 --> 28:38.216
Okay, I get it.

28:38.249 --> 28:39.283
I know why I'm here.

28:39.316 --> 28:41.318
I know why I'm in trouble.

28:41.352 --> 28:46.490
How was I supposed to know that
that would happen to his face?

28:46.523 --> 28:48.258
Fragrance sensitivity

28:48.291 --> 28:52.196
affects one
in every 15,000 Americans.

28:53.530 --> 28:55.365
What?

28:55.398 --> 28:58.902
Imagine a world
with no scented candles,

28:58.935 --> 29:01.138
with all-natural
tree sap deodorant

29:01.172 --> 29:05.076
that just makes your armpits
stick together.

29:05.108 --> 29:08.412
Look, Hunter, I forgive you...

29:08.444 --> 29:10.147
Okay.

29:10.181 --> 29:12.182
Because every allergic
reaction I have

29:12.215 --> 29:15.085
is an opportunity to spread
awareness of my condition.

29:15.118 --> 29:19.322
The amount of sheer pain
I feel on the outside is nothing

29:19.355 --> 29:23.927
compared to the amount of joy
I feel on the inside.

29:23.961 --> 29:26.130
I just hope that we
can put this past us

29:26.163 --> 29:28.332
and become friends.

29:28.365 --> 29:31.469
Me too.

29:31.501 --> 29:33.538
Lance, go back to your cabin.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.405
Thank you, Mr. Turgnofsky.

29:35.439 --> 29:37.074
You've been most gracious.

29:37.106 --> 29:40.243
#Respect, brother.

29:40.277 --> 29:42.013
#Getoutofhere, yeah?

29:46.584 --> 29:47.818
I win.

29:47.852 --> 29:49.019
Thank you, sir.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.025
Okay, I'm gonna just...

29:55.058 --> 29:58.296
How many
community service hours

29:58.328 --> 30:01.065
do you think
you've worked so far?

30:01.097 --> 30:02.399
191/2.

30:02.432 --> 30:03.901
-Wrong.
-No, right.

30:03.933 --> 30:06.538
Look, I have the time sheet,
actually.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.146
-Zero.
-What are you doing?

30:15.179 --> 30:16.881
You haven't been doing
any work.

30:16.913 --> 30:19.383
All you've been doing
is causing a disturbance.

30:19.415 --> 30:21.018
You're drifting.

30:21.050 --> 30:24.054
Hunter, your soul needs...

30:24.087 --> 30:25.423
soul.

30:25.455 --> 30:27.324
That doesn't even
make any sense.

30:32.229 --> 30:33.396
Do you even know
what this is?

30:33.430 --> 30:35.365
You don't.

30:42.038 --> 30:43.273
There.

30:43.307 --> 30:44.875
That's the kid I want to see.

30:44.909 --> 30:47.511
Okay, you just have that
stored away in your cabin?

30:47.544 --> 30:48.913
Yes.

30:48.945 --> 30:50.347
That's not creepy at all.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.416
That's the kid
we're all waiting for.

30:52.449 --> 30:54.352
Well, you're gonna be
waiting a long time,

30:54.384 --> 30:56.921
'cause I'm just trying to get
my hours done and go home.

30:56.953 --> 30:58.556
You want to get done
with your hours quicker?

30:58.588 --> 30:59.656
Yes, I do.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.158
I'll make a deal with you.

31:01.191 --> 31:03.227
Pick a team, any team,

31:03.259 --> 31:06.963
and compete in Legends.

31:06.997 --> 31:09.166
I'll count the hours
that you practice

31:09.199 --> 31:12.336
as community service hours...

31:12.368 --> 31:14.204
on top of your work hours.

31:16.673 --> 31:19.042
Deal, deal.

31:19.076 --> 31:20.443
Yes.

31:20.477 --> 31:22.647
<i>Mini James Brown.</i>

31:24.181 --> 31:25.682
Okay.
What's with the shoe, man?

31:27.984 --> 31:30.253
That's dance code
for "good job."

31:30.287 --> 31:31.588
Really?

31:31.622 --> 31:33.457
Yeah, I doubt that.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.593
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

31:35.625 --> 31:38.162
<i>We have a big day
ahead of us.</i>

31:38.194 --> 31:40.932
<i>Just a few hours
before Legends of Dance</i>

31:40.964 --> 31:42.666
<i>officially begins.</i>

31:42.700 --> 31:45.469
<i>Today's contestants,
finalize your routine.</i>

31:45.501 --> 31:47.171
No, bigger. Roll everything.

31:47.203 --> 31:48.204
We can't lose, let's go.

31:48.238 --> 31:50.942
Five, six, seven, eight, one...

31:50.974 --> 31:52.142
<i>Make sure they're sharp.</i>

31:52.175 --> 31:53.944
<i>But most of all, have fun,</i>

31:53.978 --> 31:56.614
<i>while working hard,
while having fun.</i>

31:57.714 --> 31:59.115
We're killing it out here!

31:59.148 --> 32:00.183
Dance Camp, baby!

32:00.217 --> 32:02.486
Three years, three years!

32:02.519 --> 32:04.288
One, two, three, four.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.555
Sanjana, focus.

32:05.588 --> 32:07.991
Seven, eight,
one, two, three, four.

32:08.025 --> 32:09.226
Jeb, look up.

32:09.259 --> 32:11.028
Five, six, seven, eight.

32:11.060 --> 32:13.463
One, two, three, four, and pose.

32:13.497 --> 32:15.066
Six, seven, eight.

32:15.098 --> 32:17.300
One, two, three, four.

32:17.334 --> 32:21.205
Do you have to clean
right now?

32:21.238 --> 32:23.606
I'm not here to clean.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.177
I'm here
to help you guys out.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.311
I'm here to "dance."

32:28.644 --> 32:30.714
What makes you think
you can help us?

32:42.459 --> 32:45.496
No music or anything.

32:45.528 --> 32:48.465
Okay.

32:53.369 --> 32:55.572
It was unsettling...

32:55.605 --> 32:58.742
but not completely awful.

32:58.776 --> 33:00.510
Which is what you guys
have been giving me.

33:02.346 --> 33:03.681
We're on tonight.

33:03.713 --> 33:05.482
You've got some serious
catching up to do.

33:05.516 --> 33:06.584
Yeah, no problem.

33:06.616 --> 33:08.351
Fall in line, from the top.

33:08.384 --> 33:10.121
All right, we're gonna do it
with the freeze this time.

33:10.153 --> 33:11.521
Five, six, seven, eight.

33:11.555 --> 33:14.759
One, two, three, four,
freeze, seven, eight.

33:14.791 --> 33:18.628
One, two, three, four,
freeze, six, seven, eight.

33:18.662 --> 33:22.400
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

33:22.432 --> 33:25.201
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

33:25.234 --> 33:28.338
What are you doing?

33:28.372 --> 33:30.673
I'm frees... I'm freestyling.

33:30.707 --> 33:32.643
This is choreography.

33:32.675 --> 33:34.278
You have to learn the steps.

33:34.310 --> 33:36.047
Well, yeah,
I haven't had a chance yet.

33:36.079 --> 33:37.414
You're not even trying.

33:37.448 --> 33:40.451
Look, this is
a single-elimination tournament.

33:40.483 --> 33:41.751
If you're gonna be on this team,

33:41.785 --> 33:44.822
you work as hard
as the person next to you.

33:44.855 --> 33:47.724
You better not screw me.

33:47.758 --> 33:50.326
Don't make a sexual joke.

33:50.359 --> 33:52.195
I wasn't even gonna do...

33:59.336 --> 34:00.703
I think I'm gonna go
to med school.

34:00.737 --> 34:02.173
I think that's
a more secure option.

34:02.205 --> 34:03.640
I mean, my whole family
is doctors.

34:03.673 --> 34:05.241
Well, my...

34:08.445 --> 34:09.847
My cousin taught me
how to do make up.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.748
I thought I wanted
to be a makeup artist.

34:11.782 --> 34:15.385
But then I decided that
I'm making the right decision.

34:30.266 --> 34:31.234
Chi-monee!

34:31.268 --> 34:32.503
Hee-hee!

34:32.536 --> 34:36.507
Welcome to Legends of Dance!

34:37.875 --> 34:39.643
That's the energy
I like to see.

34:39.675 --> 34:42.277
Now, let's get a quick recap
of the rules, okay?

34:42.311 --> 34:43.847
In each round,
two teams will dance

34:43.880 --> 34:45.849
set to a predetermined theme.

34:45.882 --> 34:47.518
All team members
must be present,

34:47.550 --> 34:50.621
or their team
will be... disqualified!

34:50.652 --> 34:53.224
The team that wins over
the audience's heart the most

34:53.257 --> 34:54.625
will come one step closer

34:54.657 --> 34:57.393
to becoming
Legends of Dance.

35:00.297 --> 35:03.434
Let's hear it for my mentor
and yours, Ivan!

35:05.268 --> 35:08.271
Ivan, Ivan, Ivan...

35:08.304 --> 35:09.306
Bam!

35:09.338 --> 35:10.773
Thank you, thank you.

35:10.806 --> 35:12.408
Ivan, Ivan, Ivan...

35:12.442 --> 35:14.144
And stop.

35:14.177 --> 35:15.246
I'm gonna be on standby

35:15.278 --> 35:16.547
with my honest

35:16.579 --> 35:19.315
and sometimes soul-crushing
critiques.

35:20.784 --> 35:25.222
But ultimately,
you pick who wins, all right?

35:25.255 --> 35:26.724
All right, I'm out,
peace out.

35:26.757 --> 35:31.362
First up, we've got
Flow Nation versus TBD.

35:31.394 --> 35:34.164
Is your group name
actually To Be Determined,

35:34.197 --> 35:35.766
or are you still
trying to figure it out?

35:35.798 --> 35:38.168
I wanted Dark Shadows,
so...

35:38.202 --> 35:39.703
Okay.

35:39.735 --> 35:42.472
First up, Flow Nation.

35:42.505 --> 35:45.475
Boo.

36:15.838 --> 36:18.375
You're just gonna sit there?

36:18.407 --> 36:19.943
You're not gonna stretch
or anything?

36:21.277 --> 36:23.213
No, I'm fine, I'm good.

36:40.697 --> 36:42.465
Thank you, guys.

36:42.498 --> 36:44.567
Ivan, your thoughts?

36:44.601 --> 36:48.539
There was effort.

36:48.572 --> 36:49.840
All right, guys, bring it in.

36:49.873 --> 36:51.608
Let's keep the focus.

36:51.641 --> 36:53.576
This is what
we've been training for.

36:53.610 --> 36:55.878
It's in the bag, yo.

36:55.911 --> 36:57.847
Okay, coming up next,
and let's hear it for them,

36:57.880 --> 36:59.649
it's TBD!

37:00.916 --> 37:02.219
Hunter?

37:06.989 --> 37:07.957
TBD!

37:07.990 --> 37:09.927
-TBD.
-TBD.

37:44.594 --> 37:46.896
-You're behind.
-You're ahead.

38:14.958 --> 38:16.460
That was awesome.

38:16.492 --> 38:19.096
Good stuff, TBD.
Excuse me, my little worm.

38:19.128 --> 38:20.864
Thank you.

38:20.896 --> 38:24.500
Now, let's hear the thoughts
of our resident aficionado.

38:25.969 --> 38:27.503
Was it bad?

38:27.536 --> 38:28.605
No.

38:28.637 --> 38:30.074
Were they good?

38:30.106 --> 38:31.641
No.

38:31.675 --> 38:34.345
They have to learn their steps.

38:34.378 --> 38:35.979
Excellent, now it's time
to put it for a vote.

38:36.012 --> 38:37.514
That's embarrassing.

38:37.547 --> 38:39.516
Let's get Flow Nation
on up here.

38:39.548 --> 38:42.353
Let's get your hands
nice and warm.

38:42.385 --> 38:43.721
It's time for us to vote.

38:43.753 --> 38:46.522
Let's hear it
for Flow Nation.

38:49.092 --> 38:51.762
Let's hear it for TBD.

38:53.996 --> 38:55.398
That was really close.

38:55.431 --> 38:58.868
Ivan, will you please
break this tie?

38:58.902 --> 39:01.472
In my opinion,
tonight's victor,

39:01.505 --> 39:05.409
by a narrow margin,

39:05.442 --> 39:06.610
is TBD.

39:06.643 --> 39:07.945
Congratulations.

39:07.978 --> 39:10.780
TBD will be moving on
to the next round.

39:14.418 --> 39:15.719
What the hell was that?

39:15.751 --> 39:17.454
You screwed everyone up.

39:17.487 --> 39:18.454
Me?

39:18.487 --> 39:19.956
No, no.

39:19.989 --> 39:21.858
Look, okay, I was a tad bit
slow in the beginning.

39:21.891 --> 39:22.859
But I caught up.

39:22.893 --> 39:23.860
We were fine.

39:23.893 --> 39:24.861
Fine?

39:24.894 --> 39:26.730
Fine's not gonna cut it.

39:26.762 --> 39:27.864
Cheyenne's right.

39:27.898 --> 39:29.600
Fine is no help.

39:29.632 --> 39:30.833
Look.

39:30.867 --> 39:32.102
Let's see what Lance
and his crew

39:32.135 --> 39:33.937
has in store for us today.

40:09.905 --> 40:11.507
I don't know, man.

40:11.541 --> 40:13.544
Doing backflips doesn't
make you a good dancer.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.812
It just makes you a person

40:14.844 --> 40:17.980
that's really good
at doing backflips.

40:18.014 --> 40:20.918
Yeah, but, like,
really good at doing backflips.

40:24.153 --> 40:25.456
How you guys doing?

40:25.489 --> 40:26.789
Enjoying the show?

40:26.822 --> 40:28.458
Don't worry,
I'll stay after

40:28.492 --> 40:29.893
and sign some Lance-graphs
for you.

40:40.170 --> 40:41.738
Hat trick,
three years, baby!

40:43.206 --> 40:44.807
Is this guy for real?

40:44.840 --> 40:46.509
If we're actually
gonna win this thing,

40:46.543 --> 40:47.811
you're gonna have to work.

40:47.844 --> 40:49.980
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.

40:50.012 --> 40:51.181
7:00 a.m.?

40:51.213 --> 40:53.049
Yeah, no,
can we make that 9:00?

41:10.000 --> 41:12.202
Seems like you're
not really invested.

41:15.838 --> 41:17.607
Crap!

41:30.019 --> 41:31.822
Better watch where
you're going, Hunter.

41:31.855 --> 41:34.657
Boom, sarcasm.

41:45.969 --> 41:49.206
What are you doing?

41:49.239 --> 41:51.742
Why are you making this
so hard?

41:57.880 --> 42:01.717
And snap,
and then roll down your body.

42:01.751 --> 42:03.954
Snap,
roll down your body.

42:03.987 --> 42:07.157
Two, three.
Set up, go.

42:57.373 --> 42:59.875
I can't hear you.

42:59.909 --> 43:01.677
I cannot hear you!

43:03.213 --> 43:06.182
Man.

43:06.215 --> 43:08.618
You and me, dance battle,
right now.

43:11.688 --> 43:13.356
Jeb, I never turn down
challenges,

43:13.389 --> 43:16.292
but I can't take advantage
of a special-needs kid.

43:18.427 --> 43:22.098
Well, Lance...
you might want to consider it,

43:22.132 --> 43:24.668
'cause your mom did
last night.

43:25.902 --> 43:27.670
She took care of all
of my special needs.

43:31.007 --> 43:32.409
Let's dance, you little guy.

43:40.083 --> 43:42.152
-Go!
-Go, Lance!

43:59.835 --> 44:02.004
Floor is yours.

44:02.038 --> 44:03.273
All right.

44:03.306 --> 44:04.740
Dance circle.

44:04.773 --> 44:07.109
Start out easy,
got some floor work.

44:07.143 --> 44:08.679
Hype the crowd, hype the crowd.

44:10.045 --> 44:12.248
Okay.

44:12.282 --> 44:14.017
Yo, what is this?

44:14.050 --> 44:15.052
What is this?

44:23.092 --> 44:24.728
Al Roker here.

44:24.760 --> 44:27.297
And welcome back to the
5th Annual Special Olympics.

44:29.498 --> 44:31.167
-All right, Jeb.
-All right, Jeb.

44:32.936 --> 44:34.905
-Come on, Jeb.
-You got it.

44:34.938 --> 44:36.239
Okay, that's sit-ups, dude.

44:36.271 --> 44:37.773
That's not dancing.

44:37.806 --> 44:40.142
All right, "DDR," level 8,
expert level.

44:40.175 --> 44:41.811
-What? Okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

44:41.844 --> 44:43.480
Kelsey, Kelsey,
hit it.

44:48.016 --> 44:49.318
What's he doing?

45:33.339 --> 45:35.231
All right.

45:38.568 --> 45:39.536
Hunter and Jeb forever!

45:39.568 --> 45:41.804
#Forever!

45:44.974 --> 45:46.143
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

45:46.175 --> 45:49.179
All right!

45:56.018 --> 45:57.787
Lance.

45:57.820 --> 45:58.855
From the moment we met,

45:58.887 --> 46:00.222
I knew you were
a "DDR" master.

46:00.255 --> 46:01.490
I felt the connection
between us.

46:01.523 --> 46:03.058
-All right, okay...
-And of course,

46:03.092 --> 46:04.360
it was all the things
that you said and the way...

46:04.393 --> 46:05.427
All right,
there's people here.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.428
Don't make it weird.

46:06.461 --> 46:07.931
Okay, sorry.

46:13.603 --> 46:15.271
You danced the steps.

46:15.304 --> 46:16.438
Thank you.

46:16.472 --> 46:20.410
I'm pretty good at duets.

46:20.443 --> 46:23.180
<i>He's really
embraced the camp.</i>

46:23.213 --> 46:25.248
And it has nothing to do with me

46:25.280 --> 46:27.049
taking the hours
away from him either.

46:27.083 --> 46:29.019
<i>Has he made any friends?</i>

46:29.052 --> 46:33.490
<i>Yeah, he's making
tons of friends.</i>

46:38.594 --> 46:42.064
<i>He even has a little ballerina
inside of him.</i>

46:43.900 --> 46:45.869
<i>You're sure you're talking
about my son?</i>

46:45.902 --> 46:46.869
I mean...

48:13.356 --> 48:15.225
Campers, you have spoken.

48:15.257 --> 48:17.593
And the team that will
be joining Dance-ish

48:17.626 --> 48:22.264
in the semifinals is...

48:22.297 --> 48:23.699
TBD!
Nicely done.

48:26.001 --> 48:28.404
No, this is not happening!

48:28.438 --> 48:30.340
Recount, recount, recount!

48:30.373 --> 48:32.242
It's real, and it's raw,
and we like that.

48:32.275 --> 48:35.644
Gather around,
my little birdies.

48:35.677 --> 48:40.516
Your theme
for the semifinals is...

48:40.550 --> 48:41.685
duets.

48:41.717 --> 48:43.118
Cheyenne!

48:43.152 --> 48:45.655
Cheyenne loves to duet,
right, Cheyenne?

48:48.490 --> 48:49.960
Dude, that's French,
right?

48:49.992 --> 48:51.561
Yeah.

48:51.594 --> 48:54.597
-What do I do with my chest?
-You just leave it there.

48:54.630 --> 48:56.199
-What do you mean?
-Try it, try it.

48:56.231 --> 48:58.033
-I am trying it.
-Try it.

48:58.034 --> 48:59.001
Hey.

48:59.034 --> 49:00.002
Hey.

49:00.036 --> 49:01.204
-I saw that.
-Yeah.

49:01.237 --> 49:02.472
-Can I talk to you?
-Yes, you can.

49:02.505 --> 49:04.574
Yeah, yes, you can.

49:04.606 --> 49:06.742
Jeb, do you mind?

49:06.775 --> 49:09.044
Sorry, if you want to talk
to Hunter about something,

49:09.077 --> 49:10.480
you might as well talk to me,

49:10.512 --> 49:12.114
because we don't keep
any secrets from each other.

49:12.148 --> 49:13.115
That's our rule.

49:13.148 --> 49:14.217
That is not remotely true.

49:14.250 --> 49:15.351
This bond
cannot be broken.

49:15.385 --> 49:16.353
Yes, it can.

49:16.385 --> 49:18.153
-Jeb.
-Okay.

49:18.186 --> 49:19.655
I can take a hint.

49:21.324 --> 49:23.559
Just to be sure I was
taking the hint correctly,

49:23.592 --> 49:29.465
you're saying you'd like
alone time, without me?

49:30.632 --> 49:32.969
Okay.

49:35.038 --> 49:36.106
Sorry about that.

49:36.139 --> 49:39.608
Anyway, as you know,

49:39.641 --> 49:42.444
I'm an awesome dancer.

49:42.478 --> 49:48.184
But there's this one
type of dance that,

49:48.217 --> 49:49.485
it's not like my...

49:49.518 --> 49:51.687
You know when there's
two people,

49:51.721 --> 49:53.356
dance together...

49:53.389 --> 49:56.226
Dance together,
I get it, yeah.

49:56.259 --> 49:58.494
Starts with a "D,"
ends with an "et."

49:58.527 --> 50:00.329
Involves two people,
the "D" word.

50:00.362 --> 50:02.131
-The "D" word.
-The "D" word.

50:02.164 --> 50:04.166
Yeah, "dork," you're being
a dork right now.

50:04.199 --> 50:08.237
No, that wasn't the word
I was thinking of.

50:08.271 --> 50:10.106
Look.

50:10.139 --> 50:14.210
Lance killed us last year
at the couples dance.

50:14.242 --> 50:16.712
Okay?
There was crying involved.

50:16.746 --> 50:18.314
Like, lots of crying, okay?

50:18.347 --> 50:20.283
Like, the type of crying
where you can't breathe,

50:20.315 --> 50:21.417
you're, like, crying so much.

50:21.451 --> 50:23.820
Lots of crying.

50:23.853 --> 50:27.657
Yeah, look,
that was last year, okay?

50:27.690 --> 50:29.126
I got an idea.

50:35.664 --> 50:37.500
What are we doing out here?

50:37.532 --> 50:38.768
You'll see.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.471
One, two, three.

50:44.673 --> 50:46.775
This is insane.

50:46.809 --> 50:48.411
Yeah.

50:48.443 --> 50:50.146
They're mating.

50:50.179 --> 50:52.382
-Right now?
-Right now.

50:52.414 --> 50:54.683
They're getting
down and dirty.

50:59.655 --> 51:03.326
I've never been good at
dancing with a partner before.

51:03.358 --> 51:07.230
Maybe that's because
you haven't had the right one.

51:07.262 --> 51:09.365
Follow my lead.

51:13.402 --> 51:14.670
Cheyenne, look, relax.

51:14.704 --> 51:16.439
Read my body, okay?

51:16.472 --> 51:19.175
How am I supposed to do that?

51:19.208 --> 51:20.343
Trust me.

51:20.376 --> 51:21.845
Get my hand.

51:25.847 --> 51:27.483
Look up.

51:29.751 --> 51:31.487
All right,
now rock with me.

51:42.797 --> 51:44.399
My bad.

51:44.432 --> 51:47.903
It's all right.

51:47.936 --> 51:52.241
Look, it's my job as male
to make us look good.

51:52.275 --> 51:55.144
That's sexist.

51:55.177 --> 51:56.346
No, it's leading.

51:56.378 --> 51:59.414
Definitely sexist.

51:59.447 --> 52:01.183
More so leading.

52:07.657 --> 52:09.659
You're a pretty good teacher.

52:09.692 --> 52:13.530
Yeah, I learned
from my mom.

52:13.563 --> 52:15.431
Do you have to talk
about your mom right now?

52:15.463 --> 52:18.235
Yeah, I felt that too.

52:26.775 --> 52:28.744
That was...

52:28.777 --> 52:30.512
Awesome.

52:30.545 --> 52:31.847
That was awesome.

54:24.592 --> 54:26.728
Yeah! TBD!

54:26.762 --> 54:29.899
-TBD! TBD! TBD!
-Yeah!

54:29.931 --> 54:32.834
Now, that is how you bring it
to the semifinals.

54:33.936 --> 54:36.539
Cheyenne, Hunter.

54:36.572 --> 54:37.840
The team
that will be joining

54:37.873 --> 54:39.641
E=MC "we don't have to be
good at math

54:39.675 --> 54:43.746
"because we're really
good dancers" Squared is...

54:43.778 --> 54:44.813
TBD!

54:50.786 --> 54:52.655
Ladies and gentlemen,
be safe tonight.

54:52.688 --> 54:54.523
Sayonara.

54:57.927 --> 55:01.631
Cheyenne,
you learned how to tango.

55:01.664 --> 55:02.799
Good for you.

55:02.831 --> 55:04.333
But a little piece
of advice.

55:04.367 --> 55:07.070
When you lose again
this year,

55:07.103 --> 55:08.838
try not to cry.

55:08.871 --> 55:09.838
It's embarrassing.

55:09.871 --> 55:10.839
Jerk.

55:10.873 --> 55:12.742
Good luck.

55:21.617 --> 55:22.885
-What's up, guys?
-Hey, what's up?

55:22.918 --> 55:24.688
What's up, man?

55:26.755 --> 55:29.424
No PDA, got it,
good policy.

55:29.458 --> 55:31.594
Can I talk to you?

55:31.626 --> 55:32.961
Yeah, sure.

55:34.963 --> 55:39.134
Hunter, the other night
was nice.

55:39.168 --> 55:40.603
I agree.

55:40.635 --> 55:43.105
But I can't let
any distractions

55:43.139 --> 55:46.976
get in the way
of winning Legends.

55:47.009 --> 55:50.445
We had a moment,
and it as nice, but...

55:50.478 --> 55:51.513
I get it.

55:51.547 --> 55:53.849
No, I get it.

55:53.882 --> 55:55.717
I'm just here to do my hours,

55:55.751 --> 55:59.823
and there's no point of us
getting caught up in anything.

56:23.545 --> 56:24.513
Give me your time sheet.

56:24.547 --> 56:25.681
I need to sign it.

56:25.713 --> 56:27.115
Right,
almost forgot about that.

56:27.148 --> 56:28.518
Well, you got a lot
on your mind

56:28.550 --> 56:31.186
with finals tonight.

56:36.492 --> 56:37.693
What are you doing?

56:37.726 --> 56:38.894
I'm gonna send it in.

56:38.927 --> 56:40.529
Wait, I'm done?

56:40.563 --> 56:41.898
100 hours.

56:41.931 --> 56:43.500
Good job.

57:00.483 --> 57:01.951
<i>Hey, Hunter.</i>

57:01.983 --> 57:03.786
<i>Yo, man, this summer's
been crazy, bro.</i>

57:03.818 --> 57:06.489
<i>Miss you, Hunter.</i>

57:06.521 --> 57:07.956
<i>Congrats on finishing
your hours.</i>

57:07.989 --> 57:10.092
<i>We're coming to bust you out.</i>

57:29.711 --> 57:31.746
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

57:31.780 --> 57:33.115
muchachas and amigas,

57:33.148 --> 57:38.221
the Finals!

57:38.253 --> 57:40.056
-Sanjana, Kenton.
-Hey.

57:40.088 --> 57:42.224
Looking hot, buddy.

57:42.257 --> 57:43.558
This is going to be

57:43.592 --> 57:47.262
the best night of our lives!

57:47.295 --> 57:49.564
Let's go ahead and turn it over
to one of our judges,

57:49.597 --> 57:51.701
Ivan, the guru of dance.

57:51.733 --> 57:52.934
How are you feeling tonight?

57:52.967 --> 57:55.704
Really excited
about tonight?

57:56.739 --> 57:57.974
Yes.

57:58.007 --> 58:00.209
I'm very intrigued
about what TBD

58:00.242 --> 58:02.278
is gonna be pulling
out of the bag

58:02.311 --> 58:04.713
to go up against Lance's crew.

58:07.181 --> 58:08.283
What the hell, Lance?

58:08.317 --> 58:10.119
Lance?
Who's Lance, man?

58:10.152 --> 58:11.287
-Shit.
-What's up, bro?

58:11.320 --> 58:12.688
What's up, man?

58:12.721 --> 58:13.989
What are you guys
doing here?

58:14.023 --> 58:15.591
Yo, we came
to get you out, man.

58:15.623 --> 58:16.826
Everyone's waiting.

58:16.858 --> 58:18.059
Party with your name
on it, man.

58:18.092 --> 58:19.761
Before we continue on,

58:19.795 --> 58:21.264
let's go ahead and meet
our special guest judges.

58:21.297 --> 58:22.965
First up, it's
the Prince Charming of dance.

58:22.998 --> 58:25.166
It's Mr. Bruno Tortellini.

58:25.199 --> 58:26.868
You're welcome.

58:26.902 --> 58:28.971
By the way,
the name is Tonioli,

58:29.003 --> 58:32.741
dance and reality television
royalty.

58:32.775 --> 58:34.143
It's a pleasure to meet you.

58:34.175 --> 58:36.077
I know.

58:36.110 --> 58:37.646
Jeb, where's Hunter?

58:37.679 --> 58:38.647
What?

58:38.681 --> 58:40.316
I don't know.

58:40.349 --> 58:41.918
I thought he was with you.

58:41.951 --> 58:44.086
Your little boy toy
gone missing?

58:44.119 --> 58:45.887
I heard he finished
his hours,

58:45.920 --> 58:48.857
and then he bounced.

58:48.891 --> 58:51.661
You didn't know that,
did you?

58:51.693 --> 58:53.295
She didn't know.

58:53.329 --> 58:56.865
But, like, Hunter wouldn't
flake on you guys, would he?

58:56.898 --> 58:58.634
That would
just be so terrible,

58:58.666 --> 59:03.572
because all dancers
must participate in the finals.

59:03.606 --> 59:05.742
You know that, cutie pie.

59:06.675 --> 59:09.345
Lance Camp.

59:09.378 --> 59:11.280
<i>Anyway, it's
a true honor to meet...</i>

59:11.313 --> 59:12.782
Cheyenne!

59:12.815 --> 59:13.983
Miss Lele Pons.

59:14.016 --> 59:15.718
How you feeling
about the competish?

59:15.751 --> 59:17.687
Yeah, I don't know
where I am,

59:17.719 --> 59:19.187
and I don't know
how I got here.

59:19.221 --> 59:20.989
If this is a prank,
I don't like it,

59:21.023 --> 59:23.960
'cause I'm usually the one
that pranks people.

59:23.992 --> 59:24.960
That's funny.

59:24.994 --> 59:26.095
That's hilarious, Lele.

59:27.663 --> 59:29.365
Anyways, ladies and gentlemen,

59:29.398 --> 59:31.033
put your hands together.

59:31.065 --> 59:33.868
It's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

59:33.902 --> 59:35.037
So we came to get you out,
bro?

59:35.070 --> 59:36.305
Yeah?

59:36.338 --> 59:37.707
Yo, we should
light some shit on fire.

59:37.739 --> 59:38.773
No, no.

59:38.806 --> 59:39.908
Prison break, right?

59:39.942 --> 59:42.911
No, it's not even worth it.

59:42.945 --> 59:44.080
Guys, I can't just leave.

59:44.112 --> 59:46.982
Sure you can.

59:47.016 --> 59:48.217
I guess so.

59:48.250 --> 59:50.987
I think you forgot
to get some off.

59:53.688 --> 59:54.956
Okay.

59:54.989 --> 59:56.658
You ready to bust
out of here, man?

59:56.692 --> 59:58.193
-Get in the car.
-Freedom! Let's go, baby.

59:58.226 --> 01:00:00.028
Without further ado, I...

01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:01.329
You can't.
Hunter's not here.

01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:03.231
You got to stall.

01:00:03.264 --> 01:00:04.733
-Okay.
-Stall.

01:00:04.766 --> 01:00:06.101
Okay, I'll do that.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.336
I'm gonna do that for you.

01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:08.871
It's actually
kind of annoying.

01:00:08.903 --> 01:00:09.871
It's annoying.

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:11.173
That's what I said.

01:00:11.206 --> 01:00:12.974
How would they know it
if you forgot to say it?

01:00:13.007 --> 01:00:14.143
What did I tell you about
correcting me

01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:15.210
in front of other people?

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:16.746
I wasn't correcting you.

01:00:16.778 --> 01:00:18.213
I was just adding
some more information

01:00:18.246 --> 01:00:19.882
that you forgot to say.

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:22.985
Yo, where's
that bitch Hunter?

01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:24.753
Good question.

01:00:24.786 --> 01:00:25.920
He left.

01:00:25.954 --> 01:00:27.923
No, no, he didn't.

01:00:27.956 --> 01:00:30.092
The Hunter I know
wouldn't do that.

01:00:30.125 --> 01:00:31.793
He wouldn't do that to me.

01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:32.862
Us.

01:00:32.894 --> 01:00:34.929
Jeb, I saw him.

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:37.233
He finished his hours,
and he bailed.

01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:50.846
You know you can't compete
without a full team, right?

01:00:50.878 --> 01:00:52.947
Yeah, I know.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.856
And I think I would be
reincarnated as a hawk.

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:02.024
I'm a bird of prey.

01:01:02.056 --> 01:01:03.158
In my day-to-day,

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.427
I operate
like a bird of prey.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.162
I've got a beak,
and I've got great eyes.

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.196
That's enough, Dougie.

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:08.864
Thank you, Doug.
I got it.

01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:10.799
Excuse me, campers.

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:13.702
I have an announcement
to make.

01:01:13.735 --> 01:01:15.103
It saddens me to say this,

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:19.275
but TBD will be unable
to perform tonight

01:01:19.307 --> 01:01:22.711
because they do not have
a full team.

01:01:22.744 --> 01:01:29.117
And therefore, they will have
to forfeit the competition.

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:33.321
E=MC "I don't have
to do any math

01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:36.057
because I'm a really
good dancer" Squared...

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:37.226
God, I hate that name.

01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:38.827
-It's terrible.
-I hate it.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.395
Are this year's

01:01:40.429 --> 01:01:43.231
Legends of Dance
champions!

01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:49.070
That's my baby!

01:01:49.103 --> 01:01:50.338
Three years in a row!

01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:51.840
Legends!

01:01:51.873 --> 01:01:53.908
Legends!
I'm in the books, baby!

01:01:53.942 --> 01:01:57.179
I'm in the books!

01:01:57.211 --> 01:01:58.179
Yo, what up, guys?

01:01:58.213 --> 01:01:59.981
This is Lance coming at you live

01:02:00.014 --> 01:02:02.417
with the #SpecialAnnouncement.

01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:04.786
And it looks like
I'm the first ever

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:07.890
three-year Legends of Dance
champion, son!

01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:11.193
We're living proof
that with #hardwork,

01:02:11.226 --> 01:02:13.295
#anythingispossible.

01:02:13.327 --> 01:02:14.530
Follow your dreams.

01:02:14.563 --> 01:02:17.967
Let's go, let's go.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.869
I earned it.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.940
TBD, good job, guys.

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.909
Told you.

01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:31.913
I can't believe
he actually left.

01:02:31.947 --> 01:02:34.416
Yeah, it's 'cause
he's a little punk bitch.

01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:35.818
I'm speechless.

01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:38.253
I literally have
no speech right now.

01:02:38.286 --> 01:02:39.454
I thought he was our friend.

01:02:39.487 --> 01:02:41.123
I thought this
meant more to him.

01:02:41.155 --> 01:02:42.991
I thought he cared about this
as much as we do.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.393
I thought... shit.

01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:46.295
I'm creating speech
right now, aren't I.

01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:49.030
I'm speeching...
Speaking... crap.

01:02:49.063 --> 01:02:52.500
Hey.

01:02:52.534 --> 01:02:53.936
I'm here.

01:02:53.969 --> 01:02:55.371
I made it.

01:02:58.306 --> 01:03:00.408
No, you didn't.

01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:01.777
We had to forfeit.
It's over.

01:03:26.934 --> 01:03:28.304
Hey, Hunter.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:33.608
You owe me an apology,
little guy.

01:03:33.641 --> 01:03:36.177
-For what?
-For your selfishness.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:37.913
I was supposed
to humiliate you,

01:03:37.945 --> 01:03:39.214
and you took that
away from me.

01:03:40.282 --> 01:03:41.851
You know what, asshole?

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.351
You're lucky we got
disqualified, okay?

01:03:43.385 --> 01:03:44.553
How so?

01:03:44.585 --> 01:03:46.888
Why would I be lucky?

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:53.495
You think you actually
had a chance against me.

01:03:53.527 --> 01:03:55.196
Have you seen you?

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:57.532
Have you seen Lance?

01:03:57.565 --> 01:03:59.601
You suck at dancing.

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:00.903
I rule.

01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:04.240
I'm the shit, bro.

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:05.541
What's that?

01:04:05.574 --> 01:04:08.143
Little Hunter...

01:04:08.175 --> 01:04:10.913
Little Hunter doesn't have
a comeback, does he?

01:04:10.945 --> 01:04:12.313
Nah, you're scared.

01:04:12.347 --> 01:04:15.017
You know what, asshole?

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.019
I got a comeback.

01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:21.323
TBD versus the name
of your stupid-ass team.

01:04:21.356 --> 01:04:22.958
Tomorrow night.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:24.994
Let's give the people
what they wanted, right?

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.295
We already won, Hunter.

01:04:26.327 --> 01:04:28.030
It's over.

01:04:28.063 --> 01:04:30.132
#Over.

01:04:30.164 --> 01:04:32.567
I'm cool.

01:04:32.601 --> 01:04:34.403
Now, all of these people
with their phones out

01:04:34.436 --> 01:04:35.905
recording you right now

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:38.206
will know that you
turned down a challenge.

01:04:42.277 --> 01:04:43.512
Lance,
we're gonna do it, right?

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:45.213
Chip, shut the hell up.

01:04:45.246 --> 01:04:47.215
Look, you're on.

01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:48.951
But good luck
getting your team together,

01:04:48.983 --> 01:04:51.420
because the last I heard,
they hate your ass.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:53.021
Give me my trophy.

01:04:53.054 --> 01:04:55.223
Yo, delete all those videos.

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:19.014
Hey.

01:05:19.047 --> 01:05:22.518
All right, look...

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:27.989
I know I owe the team
a lot of apologies.

01:05:28.023 --> 01:05:31.527
But listen, I wanted
to come to you first,

01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:36.030
my bunkmate,
and most importantly, my bro.

01:05:36.063 --> 01:05:40.201
Would you hear me out?

01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:43.005
All right.

01:05:43.038 --> 01:05:46.007
All right, honestly, man,

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:49.178
when I first came to camp

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:52.680
and I saw that I was
bunked with you,

01:05:52.713 --> 01:05:56.085
I was thinking,
"Dear God, why?

01:05:56.117 --> 01:05:57.987
Why?
Why me?"

01:05:58.019 --> 01:05:59.755
But since that day,

01:05:59.788 --> 01:06:06.128
I realized, yes, you can be
a dork at some times,

01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:09.063
but I've grown
to love you, man,

01:06:09.097 --> 01:06:11.700
'cause you're yourself.

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:13.501
You're not afraid
to stick up

01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:16.739
for yourself and your friends.

01:06:16.771 --> 01:06:18.239
And I figured out,

01:06:18.273 --> 01:06:22.244
that's what it takes
to make it.

01:06:24.445 --> 01:06:27.148
So I'm coming to you
and telling you

01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:33.588
that I can't do this
without you.

01:06:33.621 --> 01:06:38.393
So are you with me?

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:45.067
Hunter.

01:06:52.306 --> 01:06:55.443
You had me at "bunkmate."

01:07:03.418 --> 01:07:08.257
So... are you in, man?

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.262
Sweet.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:18.233
That's so sweet.

01:07:18.266 --> 01:07:22.104
Guys... I love you.

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:25.673
And you.

01:07:25.706 --> 01:07:28.143
So...

01:07:28.175 --> 01:07:30.711
are we doing this?

01:07:30.744 --> 01:07:34.449
Yeah, I mean, we already
learned the routine, so...

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:37.318
Yeah, I mean,
it's my last year at camp.

01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:39.420
Got nothing to lose.

01:07:39.454 --> 01:07:40.689
I'm in.

01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:44.592
That's it?

01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:45.861
Yeah.

01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:48.162
I thought about it,
and I'm in.

01:07:48.195 --> 01:07:49.697
Do you need me
to explain why?

01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:50.699
-No.
-No.

01:07:50.731 --> 01:07:51.800
'Cause I can.

01:07:51.833 --> 01:07:53.202
Sanjana, we're good.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.736
-Please.
-Keep it right there.

01:07:54.768 --> 01:07:56.404
The question is,

01:07:56.438 --> 01:07:58.874
what's Cheyenne gonna say?

01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:00.609
Okay.

01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:02.677
Good luck.

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:05.346
I challenged him
as a member of TBD.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.548
Why would you do that?

01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:08.117
You're not a member.

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:11.153
You left.

01:08:11.186 --> 01:08:14.655
And that was a huge mistake.

01:08:14.688 --> 01:08:17.259
Plus, why would we compete
in an unofficial competition?

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:20.362
Look, Cheyenne, dance
isn't about competition, okay?

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:23.432
It's about
self-expression.

01:08:23.465 --> 01:08:25.198
Yeah, it's about
letting off steam

01:08:25.233 --> 01:08:26.702
when our parents
expect us to be perfect.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:27.734
It's a way
to be creative.

01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:29.337
Or feel unique.

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.305
Or tell the world you hope
the robots do take over

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:34.176
because deep down you trust them
more than the humans!

01:08:34.207 --> 01:08:37.578
Just as a... that's just
an example of what we mean.

01:08:39.412 --> 01:08:40.849
I saw you
kiss that girl.

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:47.688
Listen, Cheyenne.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.193
Yes, her lips touched mine.

01:08:52.225 --> 01:08:53.528
But I pulled away.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.363
I promise, true story.

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:57.899
Why should I believe
anything you say?

01:08:57.932 --> 01:08:59.167
You don't have to.

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.734
I mean, it's not about me.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:04.206
It's about us, as a team.

01:09:04.238 --> 01:09:06.707
I think you want this
as much as we do,

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.344
maybe even more.

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.185
This doesn't mean
I don't hate you.

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:21.390
I'm super aware of that.

01:09:21.421 --> 01:09:22.590
But okay, screw it.

01:09:22.622 --> 01:09:24.626
Let's beat that bitch.

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:26.228
That's crazy.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:27.828
That is exactly what I was
just going to say.

01:09:28.895 --> 01:09:31.365
Let's go!

01:09:45.412 --> 01:09:46.814
Hey, Jeb.

01:09:46.846 --> 01:09:48.817
Come on, we're heading
over to costumes.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.919
We're going to the closet.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.603
Guys, Ivan doesn't know
that we're here,

01:10:41.636 --> 01:10:43.739
so we kind of want to keep
a low profile.

01:10:43.771 --> 01:10:47.442
But this is the finals

01:10:47.475 --> 01:10:49.378
we've all been waiting for.

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:54.349
Let's make some noise
for our teams!

01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:56.284
It's gonna get
so hot in here,

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:58.587
you're gonna be able
to light a match.

01:10:58.619 --> 01:11:00.721
Why would I light a match?

01:11:00.755 --> 01:11:04.292
So you don't burn
yourself.

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.594
That's why I'll
light a match?

01:11:05.627 --> 01:11:06.962
So I won't burn myself?

01:11:06.994 --> 01:11:08.329
Whatever.

01:11:08.363 --> 01:11:09.898
Think about it,
think about it.

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:12.733
Let's hear it for Lance
and his crew!

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:15.936
Lance, Lance!

01:11:30.351 --> 01:11:33.421
Hey, all the ladies,
check him!

01:11:35.657 --> 01:11:36.958
Come on!

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.706
Watch this!

01:11:55.076 --> 01:11:56.845
Come on!

01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:14.662
Higher, higher!

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.536
Yeah, baby!

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:28.703
Move!
Get out of my way.

01:13:28.735 --> 01:13:29.970
Useless.
I won, yeah!

01:13:32.739 --> 01:13:34.475
I'm the best, baby!
#LanceCamp!

01:13:34.509 --> 01:13:35.710
TBD are shit!

01:13:36.911 --> 01:13:38.779
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:41.650
Get lost!

01:13:41.682 --> 01:13:46.720
Up next is the team fighting
for sweet, sweet redemption.

01:13:46.753 --> 01:13:49.224
Let's hear it for TBD!

01:13:49.256 --> 01:13:51.025
All right.

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:53.094
You guys ready to go out there
and show them who we are?

01:13:53.127 --> 01:13:54.663
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

01:13:54.695 --> 01:13:55.697
All right, let's do this,
on three.

01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:57.198
TBD!

01:13:59.266 --> 01:14:02.136
-TBD!
-TBD, let's go!

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:58.193
Hey, hey, let's go, TBD!

01:15:47.108 --> 01:15:48.909
Yeah, Kenton!

01:15:48.943 --> 01:15:50.979
You, baby, you, baby, yo!

01:15:53.648 --> 01:15:55.283
It's not that good.

01:16:15.403 --> 01:16:17.005
Seriously?

01:16:20.908 --> 01:16:22.877
Come on, Em!
Let's go, Emily!

01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:25.246
Go crazy! Go crazy!

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.231
Champs for life.

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.266
I mean #Champs4Life.

01:17:27.742 --> 01:17:29.945
Crap.

01:17:40.921 --> 01:17:43.391
You found the little
Mini James in you.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.863
Let's party!

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.882
Guys, guys, stop.

01:18:07.914 --> 01:18:09.451
I'm trying to have
a beautiful moment here.

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.152
Enough with your tonsil hockey.

01:18:11.185 --> 01:18:13.388
One, two, three!

01:19:14.448 --> 01:19:16.351
Five, six.

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:18.485
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:19:18.519 --> 01:19:20.521
Walk up the stairs,
stride, walk down.

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:22.923
Walk up the stairs,
no, walk down.

01:19:22.957 --> 01:19:24.092
Walk up the stairs...

01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:25.092
Walk down.

01:19:25.126 --> 01:19:26.094
Walk up the stairs.

01:19:26.127 --> 01:19:27.929
Tricky-ass stairs.
