Well, ironically, the reason
they can't achieve that dream

Be the change you wanna see

05:13.382 --> 05:15.038

Why would he say that?

07:41.702 --> 07:43.221
He was a founding father.

07:43.255 --> 07:46.569
Well, maybe that's why
he knew it wasn't perfect.

07:46.604 --> 07:48.502
He knew about all
the compromises

07:53.714 --> 07:56.406
In 1787
the founding fathers

07:56.441 --> 07:59.271
were tasked with amending
the Articles of Confederation.

07:59.306 --> 08:01.757
which was thelaw of the land
at the time.

08:01.791 --> 08:03.103
But instead of doing that,

08:03.137 --> 08:05.450
they decided
to unilaterally discard

08:05.485 --> 08:07.141
the entire system
of government

08:07.176 --> 08:09.143
and replace it
with one of their own.

All in favor of exceeding
our lawful authority

the hell we want,

08:13.665 --> 08:15.391
raise your hand.What?!

08:15.425 --> 08:16.703
And getting all the states

08:16.737 --> 08:20.154
to ratify a brand-new
Constitution wasn't easy.

08:20.189 --> 08:22.432
So the document they wrote
included a lot

08:22.467 --> 08:24.538
of un-democratic compromises,

08:24.573 --> 08:27.748
especially when it came
to the question of slavery.

08:27.783 --> 08:30.371
The founders actually had
the opportunity

08:30.406 --> 08:32.650
to end slavery
in the Constitution.

08:32.684 --> 08:35.825
But then the slave-owning
states wouldn't have signed on.

08:35.860 --> 08:37.068
So, to get them on board,

08:37.102 --> 08:39.760
they made some
unforgivable compromises.

08:39.795 --> 08:42.832
Gentlemen, why are we
letting this tear us apart?

08:42.867 --> 08:44.524
Most of us own slaves.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.042
[overlapping agreement]

08:46.077 --> 08:48.355
[Adam]
They wrote in
the Rendition Clause,

08:48.389 --> 08:51.531
which required free states
to return escaped slaves

08:51.565 --> 08:52.911
to their owners.

08:52.946 --> 08:56.225
And they gave slave states
extra political power,

08:56.259 --> 08:58.020
which made it
far more difficult

08:58.054 --> 09:00.194
to abolish slavery
in the future.

09:00.229 --> 09:04.026
As a result, slavery became
so entrenched in our society,

09:04.060 --> 09:06.649
that the only way to
abolish it a century later

09:06.684 --> 09:10.826
was to fight the deadliest
war in our nation's history.

09:10.860 --> 09:13.035
We'll just ignore
this problem for now,

09:13.069 --> 09:15.727

to deal with the consequences.

tore our country apart,

09:23.355 --> 09:24.564
not to mention the fact

09:24.598 --> 09:26.427
that it didn't guarantee
rights for all citizens,

09:26.462 --> 09:28.740
didn't guarantee equal
protection under the laws,

09:28.775 --> 09:31.605
and didn't even let
black citizens or women vote

09:31.640 --> 09:33.434
for another century.

09:33.469 --> 09:35.747
None of these basic features
of our democracy

09:35.782 --> 09:38.025
were given to us
by the founding fathers,

09:38.060 --> 09:40.338
which is why celebrated
Supreme Court Justice

09:40.372 --> 09:42.892
Thurgood Marshall
said the Constitution was...

09:52.246 --> 09:53.696
But wait!
You're forgetting

09:53.731 --> 09:56.009
that in their infinite wisdom,
our founding fathers

09:56.043 --> 09:58.874
gave us the power
to amend it.

10:00.047 --> 10:02.325
Amendments allow us
to alter the Constitution

10:02.360 --> 10:03.637
and improve it.

10:03.672 --> 10:05.674
Actually,
our amendment process

10:05.708 --> 10:10.023
is so unnecessarily difficult,
that almost never happens.

10:10.057 --> 10:13.578
Short of calling a whole new
constitutional convention

10:13.613 --> 10:15.580
to rework
the entire document,

10:15.615 --> 10:17.858
to pass an amendment,
two-thirds of Congress

10:17.893 --> 10:19.377
has to agree to it,

10:19.411 --> 10:20.965
and then it has
to be ratified

10:20.999 --> 10:22.656
by three-quarters
of the states.

10:22.691 --> 10:27.074
If just 13 states don't agree,
the amendment is dead.

10:27.109 --> 10:28.593
That means it's possible

10:28.628 --> 10:30.837
for less than 5%
of the population

10:30.871 --> 10:34.185
to thwart the will
of the entire nation.

10:35.704 --> 10:38.016
Maybe that's why we haven't
been able to pass

10:38.051 --> 10:41.088
a new amendment
in the last quarter century.

10:41.123 --> 10:45.023
Well, we can't just go changing
the Constitution willy-nilly.

10:45.058 --> 10:46.611
That would be mayhem!Nope!

10:46.646 --> 10:48.095
[shrieks]It would be normal.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.442
Other countries,
and even our own states

10:50.477 --> 10:51.858
do it all the time.

10:51.892 --> 10:53.825
France changes
their constitution

10:53.860 --> 10:54.999
every two years.

10:55.033 --> 10:57.001
And the grand old state
of Georgia

10:57.035 --> 11:00.832
has completely rewritten their
state constitution ten times.

11:00.867 --> 11:03.835
I can't believe I have FOMO
'cause of France.

11:03.870 --> 11:05.388
Dang it!
I had no idea

11:05.423 --> 11:07.597
our constitution
was so restrictive.

11:07.632 --> 11:09.358
[man]
It certainly is,
and that's why

11:09.392 --> 11:11.532
we have to jump through
so many hoops

11:11.567 --> 11:14.535
in this country
to make any progress.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.089
It's Georgetown University
law professor,

11:16.123 --> 11:18.608
Louis Michael Seidman!
Are you leading a tour?

11:18.643 --> 11:20.714
Would you like to join it?Yes!

11:20.749 --> 11:23.027
[gasps]
All right, then!

11:23.061 --> 11:26.789
America's reverence
for the Constitution

11:26.824 --> 11:28.860
gets in the way of having
the kind of debates

11:28.895 --> 11:30.379
that this country needs.

11:30.413 --> 11:33.693
The words are so ridiculously
hard to change

11:33.727 --> 11:36.419
that we end up inventing
creative ways around them.

11:36.454 --> 11:39.250
For example, did you know
that the only reason

11:39.284 --> 11:42.080
we have civil rights laws
in this country today

11:42.115 --> 11:44.013
is because of the way
that judges

11:44.048 --> 11:45.981
interpreted the Commerce Clause?

11:46.015 --> 11:49.018
Instead of having
recent discussion

11:49.053 --> 11:52.228
about issues like abortion,
affirmative action,

11:52.263 --> 11:54.368
voting rights,
net neutrality,

11:54.403 --> 11:56.543
we end up
debating the intentions

11:56.577 --> 11:58.752
of a bunch of dead
old white men

11:58.787 --> 12:01.513
who knew nothing about
the way the country is today.

12:01.548 --> 12:03.723
Madison likes
my way best!

12:03.757 --> 12:05.241
No, he likes my way!

12:05.276 --> 12:08.348
I've been dead for 200 years.
Make up your own minds!

12:08.382 --> 12:11.178
And while disregarding
the Constitution seems radical,

12:11.213 --> 12:14.595
it's actually as American
as denim jorts.

12:14.630 --> 12:17.598
Thomas Jefferson thought
the Louisiana Purchase

12:17.633 --> 12:19.083
was unconstitutional.

12:19.117 --> 12:22.776
The framers never would have
recognized FDR's New Deal.

12:22.811 --> 12:24.813
Why, even Abraham Lincoln

12:24.847 --> 12:26.746
signed the Emancipation
Proclamation

12:26.780 --> 12:30.439
freeing the slaves,
and that was unconstitutional.

12:30.473 --> 12:33.200
The truth is, if we didn't
ignore the Constitution

12:33.235 --> 12:34.477
from time to time,

12:34.512 --> 12:36.169
United States
would still have slavery,

12:36.203 --> 12:38.171
and most of it would
still be part of France.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.830
Ooh, you musty old
piece of paper!

12:41.864 --> 12:44.177
I can't believe
I got a tattoo of you!

12:44.211 --> 12:45.765
Watch it, Uncle!

12:45.799 --> 12:48.768
There are still
some good things
in the Constitution.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.356
We just need to stop
treating the Constitution

12:51.391 --> 12:54.566
like it's the final word
in every political discussion.

12:54.601 --> 12:57.190
We don't need the founding
fathers' permission

12:57.224 --> 12:59.019
to make America better.

12:59.054 --> 13:00.193
You're right.

13:00.227 --> 13:03.783
America's not at its best
when we look to the past.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.371
It's when we fix the problems
in the present.

13:06.406 --> 13:09.029
[gasps]
That's what my speech
will be about!

13:09.064 --> 13:12.170
Even when it's hard,
America always moves

13:12.205 --> 13:14.517
in the right direction--
forward.

13:14.552 --> 13:16.347
Actually,
after the Civil War,

13:16.381 --> 13:18.073
we took a giant step
backwards.

13:18.107 --> 13:20.006
[crash]

13:20.040 --> 13:22.560
I guess it wasn't
bolted on.

13:24.734 --> 13:27.841
Hey, America, let's talk
about the word "America."

13:27.876 --> 13:29.670
If you live
in the United States,

13:29.705 --> 13:31.431
you're probably used
to using that word

13:31.465 --> 13:33.053
to describe this.

13:33.088 --> 13:35.090
But we here
in the old US-of-A

13:35.124 --> 13:38.610
sometimes forget that we don't
have a monopoly on the word.

13:38.645 --> 13:40.336
For many people
around the world,

13:40.371 --> 13:43.512
"America" actually refers
to all of this.

13:43.546 --> 13:45.755
Now, this is a show
written in the U.S.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.137
that debunks misconceptions
common in the U.S.

13:48.172 --> 13:50.519
and largely speaks
to a U.S. audience.

13:50.553 --> 13:53.073
So, in some cases,
our use of "America"

13:53.108 --> 13:55.179
as a stand-in
for the "United States"

13:55.213 --> 13:56.421
is appropriate.

13:56.456 --> 13:59.321
But in others,
it's a little more complicated.

13:59.355 --> 14:01.357
Like in our segment
on the true story

14:01.392 --> 14:03.877
of Christopher Columbus,
in which we said, quote,

14:03.912 --> 14:05.775
"Columbus
was an incompetent buffoon

14:05.810 --> 14:08.364
who never even set foot
in America."

14:08.399 --> 14:10.366
Now, it is true
that Christopher Columbus

14:10.401 --> 14:12.058
never set foot in
the United States.

14:12.092 --> 14:15.164
But as many of our fans from
Latin America pointed out,

14:15.199 --> 14:17.857
he did visit Haiti
and the Dominican Republic.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.341
So, as they use the word,

14:19.375 --> 14:21.170
he actually did set foot
in America.

14:21.205 --> 14:23.310
For those fans,
the fact that we forgot

14:23.345 --> 14:24.691
the word's additional meaning,

14:24.725 --> 14:26.658
actually made
our statement wrong.

14:26.693 --> 14:29.144
So, in the future,
we're gonna do better

14:29.178 --> 14:31.525
to remember that we have
a global audience,

14:31.560 --> 14:33.873
and be more deliberate about
our language.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.357
But hey, we can all still agree

14:35.391 --> 14:36.876
that Columbus
was an asshole, right?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.429
[chuckles]
Good.

14:39.948 --> 14:43.261
Fine, Adam, maybe America
isn't absolutely perfect.

14:43.296 --> 14:46.644
But we always correct
our mistakes and move forward.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.578
Like after the Civil War
when we ended slavery.

14:49.612 --> 14:52.305
And of course, that didn't
fix everything right away,

14:52.339 --> 14:55.066
but we kept progressing
towards equality.

14:55.101 --> 14:57.413
Actually, there was
remarkable progress

14:57.448 --> 14:59.001
right after the Civil War,

14:59.036 --> 15:02.142
followed by
a terrible backslide.

15:02.177 --> 15:05.974
And strangely, that's a history
we almost never tell.

15:06.008 --> 15:07.872
But I'm going to, right now!

15:07.907 --> 15:08.908
[snapping]

15:10.219 --> 15:12.152
The Civil War
marked a massive change

15:12.187 --> 15:13.533
in American life.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.880
Just years before,
the entire economy

15:15.915 --> 15:18.400
was built on the backs
of four million people

15:18.434 --> 15:20.298
enslaved as property.

15:20.333 --> 15:24.371
Then, the North won the war
and everything changed.

15:24.406 --> 15:28.341
The 13th, 14th,
and 15th Amendments
were ratified,

15:28.375 --> 15:31.413
ending slavery
and promising new rights.

15:31.447 --> 15:33.070
With the protection
of the government

15:33.104 --> 15:35.348
and the new right
to pursue education,

15:35.382 --> 15:37.867
own property, and participate
in elections,

15:37.902 --> 15:40.836
freed black Americans
were able to assert themselves

15:40.870 --> 15:42.665
and advance in society.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.358
Black Americans put forth
the first

15:45.392 --> 15:47.325
state-based
civil rights legislation,

15:47.360 --> 15:50.018
and thousands became
politicians.

15:50.052 --> 15:53.193
By 1877,
16 African Americans

15:53.228 --> 15:55.471
had even served in Congress.

15:55.506 --> 15:58.302
Remarkable, considering
that was just ten years

15:58.336 --> 15:59.855
after the end of slavery.

15:59.889 --> 16:02.823
This period was known
as Reconstruction,

16:02.858 --> 16:05.723
and the years 1867 to 1877

16:05.757 --> 16:07.380
marked one
of the greatest periods

16:07.414 --> 16:10.555
of civil rights progress
in American history.

16:10.590 --> 16:12.695
That's incredible!Yeah, it was.

16:12.730 --> 16:16.147
But then we let all
of that progress disappear.

16:16.182 --> 16:17.700
The war was over,

16:17.735 --> 16:19.909
but the forces of white
supremacy in the South

16:19.944 --> 16:21.187
weren't finished fighting.

16:21.221 --> 16:23.775
So they regrouped
to suppress black progress

16:23.810 --> 16:25.398
using terrorism.

16:25.432 --> 16:26.813
Terrorism? Ha.

16:26.847 --> 16:28.573
There weren't any terrorists
in the 1800s.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.058
Yeah, there were.

16:30.092 --> 16:32.922
During Reconstruction,
the Ku Klux Klan

16:32.957 --> 16:35.477
and their allies
launched deadly riots

16:35.511 --> 16:38.031
to scare black citizens
away from voting

16:38.066 --> 16:39.515
or organizing.

16:39.550 --> 16:41.310
They set buildings
on fire,

16:41.345 --> 16:42.863
assassinated
political leaders,

16:42.898 --> 16:46.488
and massacred more American
citizens than Al-Qaeda

16:46.522 --> 16:48.317
and ISIS combined.

16:48.352 --> 16:50.906
If that's not terrorism,
what is?

16:50.940 --> 16:52.597
This is horrific.

16:52.632 --> 16:54.565
Adam, the government
must've stepped back in

16:54.599 --> 16:55.738
and stopped them, right?

16:55.773 --> 16:57.568
Well, in the early 1870s,

16:57.602 --> 16:59.708
President Grant sent
troops into the South

16:59.742 --> 17:01.468
to confront the Klan

17:01.503 --> 17:03.332
and to enforce
the rights guaranteed

17:03.367 --> 17:04.920
in the new amendments.

17:04.954 --> 17:07.129
But America was tired
of fighting,

17:07.164 --> 17:10.339
and political will
to continue soon dwindled.

17:10.374 --> 17:13.756
So, in 1877, the troops
were withdrawn.

17:13.791 --> 17:17.036
Wait, so they just let
the terrorists win?

17:17.070 --> 17:18.865
Yes, we did.

17:18.899 --> 17:20.349
And without government
enforcement,

17:20.384 --> 17:23.042
white ex-Confederates
were able to reinstitute

17:23.076 --> 17:25.872
new systems of oppression
and brutality.

17:25.906 --> 17:27.874
They instituted poll taxes,

17:27.908 --> 17:29.186
literacy tests,

17:29.220 --> 17:31.671
stationed racist thugs
at polling places,

17:31.705 --> 17:35.640
and even passed racist
statutes like vagrancy laws

17:35.675 --> 17:37.642
that made it illegal
not to work.

17:37.677 --> 17:40.507
And the sentence
for breaking these unfair laws

17:40.542 --> 17:42.371
was forced labor.

17:42.406 --> 17:44.063
Sound familiar?

17:44.097 --> 17:46.686
No! It's just slavery
all over again!

17:46.720 --> 17:48.515
[woman]
To some degree, yes.

17:48.550 --> 17:49.999
But that's not
the glorious history

17:50.034 --> 17:52.209
America likes to tell
about ourselves.

17:52.243 --> 17:53.865
This is Christy Coleman,

17:53.900 --> 17:56.903
CEO of the American
Civil War Museum.

17:56.937 --> 17:58.560
You know, most of us
were taught

17:58.594 --> 18:00.217
that after Lincoln
freed the slaves,

18:00.251 --> 18:02.253
it took a century
of slow progress

18:02.288 --> 18:04.428
for black people
to gain civil rights.

18:04.462 --> 18:06.533
But the truth is,
by the 1960s,

18:06.568 --> 18:09.398
we weren't passing laws
giving black people new rights.

18:09.433 --> 18:11.228
We were just finally
enforcing the ones

18:11.262 --> 18:13.713
that had been promised them
100 years earlier.

18:13.747 --> 18:16.164
But why don't we learn
the real history?

18:16.198 --> 18:19.063
Because the first textbooks
about this era

18:19.098 --> 18:21.859
were written by white
Confederate sympathizers.

18:21.893 --> 18:25.311
They painted Reconstruction
as a time when black people

18:25.345 --> 18:26.829
wreaked havoc over the South

18:26.864 --> 18:29.177
because they couldn't handle
their new freedoms.

18:29.211 --> 18:31.144
And this narrative
was solidified

18:31.179 --> 18:33.319
in the American consciousness
through pop culture.

18:33.353 --> 18:37.323
The wildly popular 1915 film
"Birth of a Nation"

18:37.357 --> 18:39.808
depicted illiterate,
uncouth black men

18:39.842 --> 18:42.638
taking power in southern states
during Reconstruction.

18:42.673 --> 18:44.847
And in the 1930s,
"Gone with the Wind"

18:44.882 --> 18:47.678
became one of the most popular
books and movies in America,

18:47.712 --> 18:51.371
with its story of
a romanticized Dixie plantation

18:51.406 --> 18:53.580
where the slave owners
were gentle and kind.

18:53.615 --> 18:55.306
Slaves were happy to be there

18:55.341 --> 18:57.895
and Reconstruction
was a disaster.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.518
Not only did this dangerously
false narrative

19:00.553 --> 19:01.899
let Americans stop caring

19:01.933 --> 19:04.039
about protecting
black people's rights,

19:04.073 --> 19:05.834
we also never did anything

19:05.868 --> 19:08.906
to make up for the decades
of economic inequality

19:08.940 --> 19:10.183
caused by slavery.

19:10.218 --> 19:12.841
The truth is, we were on a path
towards progress

19:12.875 --> 19:14.325
after the Civil War.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.535
And then we chose to slide
horrifically backwards.

19:17.570 --> 19:18.709
That's terrible.

19:18.743 --> 19:20.504
How could we have let
all that happen?

19:20.538 --> 19:24.301
Oh, our country is
backsliding again right now.

19:24.335 --> 19:26.855
White supremacy
is on the rise.

19:26.889 --> 19:29.340
And the 2013
Supreme Court decision

19:29.375 --> 19:31.653
to gut the Voting Rights Act
makes it easier

19:31.687 --> 19:35.035
for state and local governments
to suppress the voting rights

19:35.070 --> 19:36.899
of Americans of color.

19:36.934 --> 19:39.419
No! We're supposed to learn

19:39.454 --> 19:41.525
from the mistakes
of our past.

19:41.559 --> 19:44.700
This country
is the worst.

19:44.735 --> 19:47.186
And that's what Americatown
needs to hear

19:47.220 --> 19:50.499
at this year's Independence Day
Holiday Blowout Extravaganza.

19:50.534 --> 19:53.053
Uncle, no!
Don't give up on America.

19:53.088 --> 19:55.677
There are still so many things
that make it great!

19:55.711 --> 19:57.748
It's more than just jorts!

20:01.441 --> 20:03.029
So I said, "Honey, you think
you've got problems?

20:03.063 --> 20:07.206
I've got four million tourists
a year crawling up my butt."

20:07.240 --> 20:09.725
[laughter and applause]

20:09.760 --> 20:10.864
What do you want?

20:10.899 --> 20:12.245
Uncle, you're not gonna
go up there

20:12.280 --> 20:13.660
and give
some depressing speech

20:13.695 --> 20:15.559
about how America's terrible,
are you?

20:15.593 --> 20:17.250
After everything
you just told me,

20:17.285 --> 20:18.424
you bet I am.

20:18.458 --> 20:22.013
Look, we tell a lot
of myths about America.

20:22.048 --> 20:23.912
But the biggest one
is that America's

20:23.946 --> 20:25.914
the best country in the world.

20:25.948 --> 20:29.055
It's called the Myth
of American Exceptionalism.

20:29.089 --> 20:31.402
But the truth is that,
like any country,

20:31.437 --> 20:33.370
America has problems,

20:33.404 --> 20:35.268
some pretty big ones,
in fact.

20:35.303 --> 20:37.891
But that doesn't mean
that America's not capable

20:37.926 --> 20:39.099
of doing great things.

20:39.134 --> 20:41.240
It means that we have
to recognize

20:41.274 --> 20:42.862
that we do the greatest things

20:42.896 --> 20:45.105
when we admit
we're not perfect.

20:45.140 --> 20:50.559
Keep that applause going
for Americatown's own Uncle Sam!

20:50.594 --> 20:52.285
[cheering and applause]You're right.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.529
Thanks, Adam.

20:54.563 --> 20:56.876
[cheering, applause continues]

20:56.910 --> 20:58.395
Hello, Americatown!

21:00.086 --> 21:02.226
So...

21:02.261 --> 21:03.745
My big speech.

21:05.747 --> 21:07.749
America is...

21:09.716 --> 21:12.374
♪♪

21:16.585 --> 21:21.280
I want America to be
a great nation.

21:21.314 --> 21:26.561
But you don't achieve greatness
by pretending to be great.

21:28.183 --> 21:31.359
You achieve it by admitting
you suck sometimes,

21:31.393 --> 21:33.568
and then you work
to do better.

21:34.741 --> 21:36.053
And only then,

21:36.087 --> 21:40.333
after we shed the myth that
America was born perfect,

21:40.368 --> 21:45.476
can we truly do what
the founding fathers intended--

21:45.511 --> 21:49.273
strive to achieve
a more perfect union.

21:51.379 --> 21:54.313
[cheering and applause]

22:00.249 --> 22:01.906
Oh, thank you.

22:01.941 --> 22:04.081
Thank you so much.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.220
[sighs]

22:05.254 --> 22:07.878
Hey, Adam?Yeah?

22:07.912 --> 22:10.225
You gotta pay for that display
you broke in the museum.

22:10.259 --> 22:11.744
Oh, right, sorry.

22:14.022 --> 22:15.575
Could you spot me?

22:18.129 --> 22:19.234
[woman]
It's a first draft.

22:19.268 --> 22:20.373
Okay, this is a--

22:20.408 --> 22:22.582
this is a first draft
of your animated self.

22:22.617 --> 22:24.066
Oh, wow!What do you think?

22:24.101 --> 22:25.723
I mean, it's animation.
We can do anything.

22:25.758 --> 22:27.898
Just e-mail Stephanie
with what your request is

22:27.932 --> 22:29.417
and we'll make you
look that way.I do like it.

22:29.451 --> 22:32.178
You run the American
Civil War Museum in Richmond.Yes.

22:32.212 --> 22:33.697
So what do you try
to get across,

22:33.731 --> 22:35.492
you know, someone's coming
to your museum,

22:35.526 --> 22:37.563
what's the most important
thing you want them to know

22:37.597 --> 22:38.667
about the Civil War
when they leave?

22:38.702 --> 22:40.048
It matters for everything
they live

22:40.082 --> 22:41.394
in their life right now.

22:41.429 --> 22:43.707
Three very important
Constitutional
amendments happened

22:43.741 --> 22:45.053
because of this war.

22:45.087 --> 22:46.882
We have the 13th Amendment
abolishing slavery.

22:46.917 --> 22:47.987
You got the 14th Amendment

22:48.021 --> 22:49.506
with equal protection
under the law

22:49.540 --> 22:51.404
and citizenship definition.

22:51.439 --> 22:53.544
And then the right to vote
is extended, right?

22:53.579 --> 22:54.752
Yeah.I mean, that's huge.

22:54.787 --> 22:57.376
The nation will spend
the next hundred years

22:57.410 --> 23:00.551
fighting to actually
implement what was passed.

23:00.586 --> 23:03.071
That's the wild thing
is those amendments

23:03.105 --> 23:06.005
and those laws were passed
and they weren't enforced.

23:06.039 --> 23:09.836
You know, as complex
as this history is, it's--

23:09.871 --> 23:12.977
what's remarkable to me
is that there's always
been people,

23:13.012 --> 23:16.567
always been people
choosing,

23:16.602 --> 23:19.812
in the words of Dr. King,
to bend the arc of justice.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.710
Yeah.Right? Because
they do believe

23:21.745 --> 23:23.850
in what the nation
really can be.

23:23.885 --> 23:25.852
Do you still have
that optimism?

23:25.887 --> 23:27.164
Because,
what we're talking about

23:27.198 --> 23:30.098
in this episode is how
there was a huge backslide

23:30.132 --> 23:32.065
after Reconstruction
was abandoned.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.654
And we connect that
to today, that in many ways

23:34.689 --> 23:36.449
it feels like
we're backsliding

23:36.484 --> 23:39.245
on some of the gains we've had
over the past decades.

23:39.279 --> 23:40.729
And we're trying
to make that point

23:40.764 --> 23:42.386
that history is
an inevitable.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.527
During periods
of great progression

23:45.562 --> 23:47.805
and expansion of rights,

23:47.840 --> 23:50.532
there are always those
who feel threatened by that.

23:50.567 --> 23:52.361
And so there is almost
an immediate--

23:52.396 --> 23:53.811
It's like, think of
a rubber band, right?

23:53.846 --> 23:54.985
You're stretching
the rubber band.Yeah.

23:55.019 --> 23:56.262
You're stretching,
you're stretching.

23:56.296 --> 23:58.229
And then it snaps
back on you, right?Yeah.

23:58.264 --> 24:00.715
But it never is as tight
as it was before

24:00.749 --> 24:02.406
when it starts
stretching even further.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.720
Yeah.And that's kind of how
American history is.

24:05.754 --> 24:07.894
We have these periods
of great progress.

24:07.929 --> 24:10.207
We snap back
really hard fast,

24:10.241 --> 24:12.243
sometimes extraordinarily
violently.

24:12.278 --> 24:15.868
And so the snap back, yes,
feels really bizarre.

24:15.902 --> 24:18.422
Yes.But it's essentially
the same force

24:18.457 --> 24:20.044
that's in play.The thing that
we've seen before?

24:20.079 --> 24:22.046
Right, so they'll have
their moment,

24:22.081 --> 24:24.255
and then
the expansions continue

24:24.290 --> 24:25.740
until there's a completely
different model.

24:25.774 --> 24:27.638
Well, thank you so much
for coming here...Thank you!

24:27.673 --> 24:29.088
...to talk to us about it.It's a pleasure.

24:29.122 --> 24:30.779
It's been wonderful.Thank you.
