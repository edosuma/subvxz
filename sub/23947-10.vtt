00:26.610 --> 00:28.820
There are birds called demoiselle cranes.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.198
Amazing things that migrate
over the Himalayas for the winter.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.953
You can probably get there
using the same method.

00:36.078 --> 00:36.912
As the cranes?

00:38.288 --> 00:40.123
First, go to the northern cliff.

00:40.791 --> 00:41.667
Northern cliff?

00:42.209 --> 00:46.797
Right. Jump off of the northern cliff
at a speed of at least 15 kph.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.676
After you fall for two seconds,
then right here...

00:51.677 --> 00:52.803
whoosh!

00:53.804 --> 00:54.930
I spread my wings.

00:57.015 --> 01:01.395
Then, if you catch one of the updrafts
that occur there during this season,

01:02.187 --> 01:04.940
it'll automatically carry you
above the clouds.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.154
Once you're above the clouds,
start flying towards Canopus.

01:11.863 --> 01:14.157
Towards Canopus? What's there?

01:15.242 --> 01:17.286
A white ship hidden among the stars.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.413
A ship?

01:21.081 --> 01:25.585
An enormous airship built during the war
called the <i>Moby Dick.</i>

01:26.712 --> 01:29.381
It's Market Maker's base of operations.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.468
If she's anywhere, that's where she'll be.

01:35.887 --> 01:36.722
Would Yuna...

01:39.099 --> 01:40.767
be waiting for me?

01:44.313 --> 01:45.772
I told you, didn't I?

01:46.148 --> 01:49.443
That I was the one
who deciphered the Jetblack inscription.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.611
Yeah.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.405
Everyone said the glyphs
couldn't be cracked

01:53.780 --> 01:55.907
because the meaning changes

01:56.325 --> 01:58.619
depending on their combination
and reading direction.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.413
Vertically, horizontally, diagonally.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.207
Odd numbers, even numbers.
Prime numbers, roots.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.585
Countless patterns exist,

02:07.419 --> 02:10.005
with each of them
forming their own sentences.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.799
Not many know this,

02:12.883 --> 02:14.885
CULTURE, ECONOMICS, PHILOSOPHY, GEOGRAPHY

02:14.968 --> 02:18.597
but the slab contains as much information
and mythology as the Bible.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.474
MEDICINE, RELIGION, ART, LANGUAGE, HISTORY

02:22.893 --> 02:25.520
Of course,
it was full of similes and metaphors,

02:25.604 --> 02:29.274
so there's a lot you can't make sense of.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.445
But one passage is hard to ignore.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.199
"The Tale of the Two Shrine Maidens."

02:38.492 --> 02:40.535
On the night of the 13th full moon,

02:40.744 --> 02:45.123
the man chosen by the two shrine maidens
gained power, companions, and wings,

02:45.374 --> 02:47.376
and became the black-winged king.

02:48.418 --> 02:53.715
Their purpose fulfilled, the two maidens
presented to him a blade that burned blue.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.301
"Decapitate one of us," they said.

02:58.136 --> 03:02.224
The maiden whose head was cut off
turned to ash and merged with the king,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.518
granting him still another power.

03:05.811 --> 03:10.357
The remaining maiden became his wife and
fought at his side atop Cremona's summit

03:10.482 --> 03:12.609
and shared his fate when the end came.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.324
Does that sound familiar?

03:23.453 --> 03:28.542
Me, my father... No, everyone
who ever came into contact with it,

03:29.584 --> 03:31.920
we all became driven by that tablet.

03:32.921 --> 03:37.551
If we define god as something eternal
that can bend fate to its will,

03:38.677 --> 03:41.346
then that tablet itself is god.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.440
If we're driven by that tablet,

03:53.400 --> 03:57.904
then as long as I have
anything to do with it... Yuna will die.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.457
If there really is such a thing as fate,

04:09.124 --> 04:10.542
then accept it all.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.045
If you don't like it, then fight back.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.175
Koku.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.761
Don't fear the future.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.638
The hope, the despair...

04:24.639 --> 04:26.099
see it all for yourself.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.296
This is the beginning.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.220
You and I will save our brethren together.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.679
It won't be you.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.810
His world is strictly below the clouds.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.647
Even if he should try to reach the stars,

05:14.773 --> 05:17.943
his wings will simply be burned by ice,
and he will fall.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.114
Just like Icarus.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.452
He's going to come.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.623
Koku will definitely...

06:00.694 --> 06:04.614
He probably won't use the main streets.
You can't predict travel time.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.617
These roads over here
would be the safer bet.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.744
He'd stand out more in alleys.

06:10.495 --> 06:15.417
He's on the run. Would he use a street
he knew was prone to traffic jams?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.085
None of that matters.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.880
As far as he's concerned,
this is an ordinary day.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.092
I don't know
if I can call this an ordinary anything.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.305
In any event,
we'll never make any headway.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.724
We have to narrow down the search.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.183
What is it?

06:32.267 --> 06:34.603
That crowd search software I used earlier.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.815
We may be able to use it.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.525
Of course.

06:41.484 --> 06:45.405
We just need to tweak it
so it flags any cars behaving irregularly.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.489
Can you do that?

06:46.573 --> 06:49.284
I can, but there's one small problem.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.703
There aren't enough satellites.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.122
If I can get 1/200,000,000th
of the Earth...

06:54.205 --> 06:56.041
That's a radius of 1.8 km.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.917
How many do you want?

06:58.001 --> 06:58.835
Two more.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.090
This is okay, right?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.052
Oh my.

07:08.845 --> 07:09.679
Will that do?

07:09.971 --> 07:10.931
How did you...

07:12.057 --> 07:14.517
Something this old-timer taught me
long ago.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.438
Lily's life is on the line. Hurry.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.909
No one is coming to your rescue.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.788
He won't have enough time...

07:35.497 --> 07:37.958
to find this place.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.545
Got it.

07:43.088 --> 07:43.964
Where is he?

07:44.089 --> 07:46.257
-Heading for the harbor area.
-The sea?

07:46.800 --> 07:50.428
Kaela, display his maximum travel distance
centered around those spots.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.972
-You mean by ship.
-Right.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.139
At what speed?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.725
Use the average.
There's no traffic at sea.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.394
That's 22 knots.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.397
So around 0.5 miles?
What about the margin of error?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.648
Use another color.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.070
-What's this?
-The Ramon Ports & Harbors District.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.073
It's military-controlled
and off-limits to the public.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.368
Ramon?
Where have I heard that name before?

08:13.743 --> 08:16.162
From Ramon Psychiatric Hospital, remember?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.081
Dead Kyle.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.877
Yes. That's the hospital
where he was being treated.

08:22.961 --> 08:23.878
Hospital?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.589
His adoptive father was a navy man,

08:27.132 --> 08:30.218
so maybe he pulled some strings
to get him admitted.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.761
It seems they also have ties to us.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.679
What?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.181
Look at this.

08:35.932 --> 08:40.895
Apparently, unclaimed bodies are delivered
to the lab to be used as cadavers.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.188
Dead bodies? Delivered?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.115
<i>It's the anniversary of her death, huh?
<i>The year flew by.</i></i>

09:05.920 --> 09:06.755
<i>Erika.</i>

10:21.579 --> 10:25.708
<i>This country is crawling with more
<i>discarded Reggies than you can imagine.</i></i>

10:28.128 --> 10:31.422
It's just that no one is noticing it.

10:59.951 --> 11:00.785
Another cadaver?

11:05.415 --> 11:06.249
No.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.210
That's not right.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.476
Another cadaver?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.069
Thanks.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.386
Kaela, go through Gilbert's exit logs.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.473
From the lab? Sure, hang on.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.184
No way.

12:07.310 --> 12:11.314
According to the logs,
Gilbert Ross hasn't left the lab.

12:11.773 --> 12:12.607
What?

12:12.690 --> 12:16.819
In the past eight years, how many times
has Gilbert worked past midnight?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.404
Thirty-seven times.

12:19.781 --> 12:24.035
Black hair, fair skin, brown eyes.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.830
Around 25 years old, under 160 cm.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.250
How many unsolved disappearances
are of women fitting that profile?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.002
Thirty-seven incidents.

12:34.921 --> 12:35.922
No doubt about it.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.174
Gilbert's lair...

12:40.343 --> 12:41.177
is right here.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.829
Kaela, can you pull up
this building's blueprints?

13:09.414 --> 13:11.541
Looks like there are a lot. Which one?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.458
All of them.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.963
It's been altered a lot.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.841
They kept adding to it
over the past 300 years.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.761
That explains why each floor
is a different architectural style.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.057
Kaela, display the plans,
but separated out by year.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.809
Give me a second.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.812
-Also, show us attics and crawlspaces.
-Okay.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.439
-Voids between the additions.
-Done.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.483
Any dead space larger than 180 cm.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.193
That's this one.

13:40.028 --> 13:40.862
Done.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.867
It's right under our noses,
but we don't see it.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.910
Kaela, call for backup!

13:47.994 --> 13:49.412
-We can't.
-Why not?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.291
Think about it.
Could he pull all this off by himself?

13:53.791 --> 13:54.876
It's not possible.

13:56.002 --> 13:56.878
But...

13:57.754 --> 14:01.132
We don't know how many people
he has on the inside.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.969
It's possible that there's more of them
than there are of us.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.638
We need a decisive blow
or they'll crush us.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.140
What should we do, then?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.727
We'll put an end to this all by ourselves.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.646
Take these off me.

15:16.833 --> 15:17.667
Let's go.

15:20.711 --> 15:21.546
Right!

15:34.267 --> 15:37.437
When we catch Gilbert,
what do you plan to do with him?

16:03.629 --> 16:07.383
There was a space like this
hidden inside the station house?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.722
There's... There's so many!

16:25.151 --> 16:26.068
Puzo.

16:26.986 --> 16:27.820
Who's that?

16:28.571 --> 16:31.449
The chief executive
of the Jaula Blanca Institute,

16:32.158 --> 16:35.786
the organization dedicated
to reviving the divine bloodline,

16:36.496 --> 16:37.622
Albert Puzo.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.291
Father of Gilbert Ross,

16:41.125 --> 16:43.002
and the first man he ever killed.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.840
This is where he began.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.597
He killed everyone here by himself?

16:54.889 --> 16:58.267
This is far more than 37 people!
What would he do this for?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.186
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

17:00.770 --> 17:01.896
You must be joking!

17:02.522 --> 17:03.940
This is madness! Keith!

17:04.898 --> 17:06.483
Nothing but simple madness!

17:08.194 --> 17:10.363
I've investigated him for a long time.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.491
He probably noticed as well.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.410
But nothing's changed.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.664
He kills people
like the rest of us breathe,

17:19.747 --> 17:23.000
and then resumes his routine
as if nothing happened.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.255
Days later, someone else is arrested,

17:27.880 --> 17:30.967
and after they confess,
they die in one way or another.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.262
Suicide. Murder. Sickness.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.015
After everything has been reset,

17:38.808 --> 17:41.477
he goes back to his daily routine.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.066
That's crazy! He couldn't possibly...

17:47.525 --> 17:48.359
He could.

17:49.193 --> 17:53.239
All you need is immense power.
A heart incapable of remorse. And...

17:54.073 --> 17:56.701
a brain that's superior
to everyone around you.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.505
<i>Hello, Keith. Are you still there?</i>

18:11.716 --> 18:12.550
Where's Lily?

18:13.009 --> 18:15.511
<i>She really does look like Erika,
<i>doesn't she?</i></i>

18:16.137 --> 18:19.181
<i>Right down to the color of her skin
<i>and of her eyes.</i></i>

18:19.890 --> 18:22.643
<i>So tell me,
<i>what do you want me to do?</i></i>

18:24.312 --> 18:25.479
Whatever you want.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.487
You only used one scalpel, huh?

18:35.072 --> 18:37.992
Looks like you ran out of here
in a big hurry.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.495
Did we get here early?

18:42.913 --> 18:45.708
You don't have Lily with you.
And she isn't dead.

18:46.751 --> 18:50.296
Because you couldn't use Lily
to slow me down if she were dead.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.426
Gilbert. I'm not the man I used to be.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.429
I have teammates this time.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.684
<i>Don't make me laugh. Teammates?</i>

19:06.687 --> 19:08.773
You're going to escape tonight.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.734
For now, that's fine. Run.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.779
But no matter how far you go,

19:15.821 --> 19:19.200
the only thing waiting for you
will be despair and darkness.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.287
I will hunt you down, and I will find you.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.999
And then I'll kill you
with my own two hands.

19:27.708 --> 19:32.380
<i>I'm happy to hear you say those words,
<i>my dear friend Keith Flick.</i></i>

19:46.060 --> 19:47.478
Excuse me, is this--

19:53.150 --> 19:54.151
Lily!

20:09.333 --> 20:10.209
Lily!

20:12.795 --> 20:13.838
-Keith?
-Here!

20:15.881 --> 20:17.341
She's been drugged!

20:17.466 --> 20:18.300
Lily!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.428
Lily, hang on!

20:20.970 --> 20:22.430
It's okay, move that one!

20:25.224 --> 20:26.058
Lily!

20:26.517 --> 20:27.393
She'll be fine!

20:27.476 --> 20:29.729
Set up a cordon! And get an ambulance!

20:30.396 --> 20:31.230
<i>Kaela!</i>

20:31.522 --> 20:32.356
Yes, sir!

20:32.773 --> 20:36.819
<i>Gilbert escaped! Lock down the area
<i>around the station immediately!</i></i>

20:36.902 --> 20:38.028
Roger that! Um...

20:38.738 --> 20:41.365
-We've got Lily back in one piece.
<i>-Seriously?</i>

20:42.324 --> 20:46.454
But she's been injected with a drug.
Call for an ambo!

20:46.746 --> 20:47.580
<i>Roger!</i>

20:52.126 --> 20:54.003
This is what he used to get away?

21:00.468 --> 21:02.052
You're pretty amazing.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.815
I'm moving up the timetable!

21:15.316 --> 21:19.111
Kill everyone with ties
to the Royal Police! Do it right now!

21:19.987 --> 21:21.363
Use the gas if needed!

21:22.698 --> 21:24.200
<i>We're busy right now.</i>

21:24.283 --> 21:25.117
What?

21:25.826 --> 21:30.331
<i>Our hands are full at the moment.
<i>We can't spare any time to deal with you.</i></i>

21:30.706 --> 21:32.792
You... Are you trying to be funny?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.543
<i>Not at all.</i>

21:37.588 --> 21:40.716
We're grateful to you. You saved us.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.135
<i>But...</i>

21:43.636 --> 21:46.472
we also saved you.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.015
<i>Minatsuki.</i>

21:48.390 --> 21:50.476
Well, I have things to do. Sorry.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.645
<i>Hey! Wait! Minats--</i>

22:20.089 --> 22:21.841
Damn it! Damn it!

22:22.633 --> 22:24.301
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

22:46.991 --> 22:49.827
I knew. I can't beat Keith.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.037
I knew that.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.792
And yet he...

23:00.754 --> 23:01.672
Erika, don't go!

23:04.675 --> 23:05.801
Erika! Erika!

23:07.177 --> 23:08.012
Erika!

23:08.596 --> 23:09.430
Erika!

23:09.888 --> 23:12.683
Erika! Erika! Don't go.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.190
Don't leave me.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.152
Erika.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.748
He's finally dead?

23:46.925 --> 23:51.472
They're all behaving so predictably,
it's almost funny.

23:52.681 --> 23:53.766
They're so simple.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.608
All that's left now is the epilogue.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.486
Let's finish this, Genie.

26:09.568 --> 26:13.489
