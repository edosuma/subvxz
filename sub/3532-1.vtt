WEBVTT

00:09.414 --> 00:11.513
When my ass was 19 years old,

00:11.633 --> 00:14.731
I changed the face
of professional baseball.

00:15.506 --> 00:18.555
Ladies and gentleman do we have
a barn burner on one?

00:18.675 --> 00:21.621
Bottom of the night,
game 7, bases loaded, 2 down

00:21.742 --> 00:24.115
and Atlanta has gone to the ball
penalty with workin'picture

00:24.239 --> 00:26.771
Kenny Powers.
This kid is untested folks.

00:26.891 --> 00:29.747
Untested,
he's run the count 4 to Eddy Patterson.

00:29.933 --> 00:33.147
The all star first basement.
Closer down off a third.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.237
Paterson off second,
Powers on third.

00:35.357 --> 00:36.600
He shakes off a sign,

00:36.720 --> 00:38.303
and the 3-2 pitch

00:38.828 --> 00:41.751
- And he's done it.
- Get fucking out.

00:42.430 --> 00:44.025
Kenny Powers has done it,

00:44.161 --> 00:46.757
Kenny Powers has done it, Atlanta
won the series, listen to this crowd.

00:46.919 --> 00:49.052
I was handed the keys to the kingdom.

00:49.172 --> 00:51.051
Multimillion dollar deals.

00:51.171 --> 00:52.386
Endorsements.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.842
Everyone wanted a piece of my shit.

00:58.248 --> 00:59.604
You are fucking out.

00:59.803 --> 01:01.792
You're fucking out.

01:03.655 --> 01:06.636
Just a man with a mind for victory
and an arm like

01:06.765 --> 01:08.450
a fucking canon.

01:11.447 --> 01:13.769
But sometimes
when you've been in the thunder.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.661
you get lost in the storm.

01:16.011 --> 01:18.174
I'm sick and tired
of carrying all the weight.

01:18.523 --> 01:21.351
This coach and this owner is not
giving me the shit I need to win.

01:21.870 --> 01:24.020
Atlanta,
you're fucking out.

01:24.293 --> 01:25.825
Kenny Power is now a free agent.

01:25.995 --> 01:27.974
Bought* a bar,
get ship bases, huh?

01:28.094 --> 01:30.570
Get me paid bitch.
Superstar!

01:33.132 --> 01:33.923
So Kenny,

01:34.043 --> 01:35.983
How do you feel about playing
for New York?

01:36.106 --> 01:38.532
You mean Jew York, it's fucking great.

01:41.512 --> 01:43.974
I gotta tell you.
I thought the blacks in Boston were bad.

01:44.094 --> 01:45.910
But it turns out
they're nothing compared to

01:46.046 --> 01:47.691
these fag we got from San Francisco.

01:50.566 --> 01:51.834
Here a true champion,

01:51.954 --> 01:54.431
face to face with his darkest dare.

01:54.695 --> 01:57.077
It could take whatever
it takes to rise above.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.406
Do you have any comments
on the steroid allegations?

01:59.756 --> 02:01.623
I said I'm not on steroids!

02:01.834 --> 02:04.275
A man fights, fights,

02:04.428 --> 02:06.475
and then fights some more.

02:06.665 --> 02:08.479
Because surrender is death.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.572
And death is for pussies.

02:10.692 --> 02:13.436
Kenny Powers, a career in the one shot
so much promised....

02:13.571 --> 02:15.554
Hello men, come on mother fucker

02:15.716 --> 02:17.982
- you can feel the sun going down on.
- With a count 2 and 0

02:18.111 --> 02:20.851
and a runner at 3rd.
One out here in the end.

02:21.524 --> 02:22.542
He stretches.

02:22.794 --> 02:26.050
Swangs on. And that ball
is gonna be out in a hurry.

02:26.170 --> 02:28.368
The nail on the coffin of a career

02:28.501 --> 02:30.400
and Kenny Powers kicks his glove.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.209
You're fucking out!

02:32.497 --> 02:34.091

03:11.429 --> 03:13.403

03:13.862 --> 03:16.422
He looks like a big bag full

04:29.901 --> 04:30.762
Thanks.

04:32.050 --> 04:34.797
Did you get the Christmas cards

04:35.967 --> 04:37.029
Yeah I think so.

04:37.153 --> 04:40.331
I mean I got a ton of fan mail

04:46.148 --> 04:48.749
The one you sent three years ago.
It's in the garage.

04:49.275 --> 04:50.585
Three years.

04:52.199 --> 04:53.928
Well, this is a tenant bed,
you know,

04:54.232 --> 04:54.906
so.

04:55.206 --> 04:58.644
You boys ever attacked anybody?
Beat up any kids in the neighborhood?

04:58.910 --> 05:00.726
When we were kids,
me and your dad,

05:00.846 --> 05:03.089
used to beat a shit
out of this retard brother

05:03.234 --> 05:05.493
that used to live down the street
from us... hilarious.

05:05.613 --> 05:08.901
This guy was the most ruthless one.
Now, I was in here, he's got a family,

05:09.168 --> 05:12.063
- he's got a nice shirt on.
- We try to teach our children,

05:12.236 --> 05:15.285
not to make fun
of others who are challenged.

05:15.443 --> 05:17.837
Mongoloid Mike,
is that he used to call him?

05:17.957 --> 05:20.323
He busts his head with a stick,
remember that?

05:20.834 --> 05:23.307
I think we're gone tone
down the language, right?

05:23.427 --> 05:25.929
Hey Mama,
I'm still blown and you got three kids.

05:26.074 --> 05:29.215
I mean I remember you having this one.
All blond of you everywhere.

05:29.875 --> 05:30.999

05:31.989 --> 05:34.803
Three and some young men.
The Powers'way.

05:35.048 --> 05:37.130
The littlest one is a girl.

05:38.363 --> 05:39.639
You certainly are!

05:40.151 --> 05:42.246
Her name is Rose,

05:42.398 --> 05:44.820
named after Kate Winslet
in the movie Titanic.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.381
You named your daughter
out of fucking Titanic?

05:50.396 --> 05:51.931
It's Cassie's favorite movie.

05:53.074 --> 05:54.354
You gotta be shiting me.

05:55.933 --> 05:57.663
What's his name?
Fucking Shrek?

06:00.841 --> 06:02.380
No, OK.

06:08.754 --> 06:09.922
Hey, hey!

06:10.299 --> 06:11.613
Did you hear about Brian?

06:11.733 --> 06:14.392
He get his head burned off
in a motorcycle accident last year.

06:14.581 --> 06:17.823
- And his face literally is burned off?
- Straight off. It's gross.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.626
I mean anytime anyone
has some sort of.

06:20.966 --> 06:23.667
I can handle a limb gone or a leg,
but any sort of

06:23.797 --> 06:26.413
infirmary on the face It's just like,
I don't wanna be around you.

06:26.543 --> 06:29.922
I don't want to try to identify with you
as a human it's just disgusting like...

06:30.084 --> 06:32.225
- It's hard to look at.
- It's gross. You know what,

06:32.345 --> 06:34.761
I'm not gonna talk to Brian
anymore because I don't want to have

06:34.891 --> 06:37.032
be almost throwing up
when I speak to him.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.872
So thanks for letting me crash here.
I appreciate it.

06:43.043 --> 06:44.585
Yeah, sure man.

06:46.441 --> 06:49.066
Cass and I wondered
speaking of which,

06:50.572 --> 06:52.366
how long do you plan on, you know,

06:53.943 --> 06:55.017
- staying here?

06:55.930 --> 06:57.076
Why? I mean like that.

06:57.203 --> 07:00.340
And how much times do I have
to tell you this? Gatorade is still

07:00.470 --> 07:03.055
trying to get a piece out of my ass.
I got the IRS up on my shit I need

07:03.175 --> 07:06.136
to take a job so that the government
can gage my fucking wages, men.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.597
I mean, give me
a little breather room here.

07:08.806 --> 07:11.872
You just gotta give me some
walk around money and that'll be fine?

07:13.017 --> 07:14.432
How long think that's gonna be?

07:14.552 --> 07:17.645
You wanna know how much I'll stay in
here? Four fucking years. About that?

07:17.796 --> 07:20.408
Really, we're brothers.
You want me to really give you a date?

07:20.852 --> 07:22.308
No,
no, just...

07:23.098 --> 07:25.507
Well, I just wanna know
how long it's gonna be till you...

07:26.046 --> 07:27.041
Till what?

07:28.830 --> 07:31.304
- Get your shit together, Kenny.
- I'm kidding.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.022
I'm not.

08:13.129 --> 08:16.005
Undoubted,
I knew the game was mine to win.

08:16.577 --> 08:20.163
Just like in life,
all of my successes depend on me.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.680
I'm the man who has the ball,

08:22.800 --> 08:25.478
I'm the man who can throw it
faster than fuck.

08:25.897 --> 08:28.042
So that is why I am better

08:28.172 --> 08:30.226
than everyone in the world.

08:30.574 --> 08:33.943
Kiss my ass and suck my dick,
everyone.

08:34.325 --> 08:36.582
You've reached the end
of cassette nÂ°2...

08:39.948 --> 08:42.399
You're listening to the audio book
"You're fucking out,

08:42.696 --> 08:44.964
I'm fucking in
"by Kenny Powers".

08:45.089 --> 08:46.632
Narrated "by Kenny Powers".

09:04.303 --> 09:07.120
I mean he draw a pentagram
made of penises.

09:07.624 --> 09:09.660
You know I think he's a real psycho.

09:10.079 --> 09:11.660
I got my major in Arts,

09:11.838 --> 09:14.378
not psychology.
I don't know what to tell this kid.

09:14.659 --> 09:15.476
April!

09:21.515 --> 09:22.401
April!

09:26.993 --> 09:28.371
What's happening gorgeous?

09:29.139 --> 09:30.026
Okay.

09:32.056 --> 09:36.054
- Just you in my arms here, OK.
- Could you let me go please?

09:36.782 --> 09:38.206
I recognize your scent.

09:38.824 --> 09:40.402
Do you recognize my essence?

09:40.871 --> 09:44.018
- Yeah, that feels familiar.
- It's nice to see you too.

09:44.319 --> 09:46.179
I'm gonna need to change my pants.

09:49.031 --> 09:50.800
I'm just playing out to uncool my pants.

09:52.536 --> 09:54.463
Did I?
I was surprised

09:54.592 --> 09:56.931
when I heard that
you were coming back.

09:57.249 --> 09:58.170
You know,

09:58.290 --> 10:00.935
I'm just here to do some rehab
on the shoulders, you know.

10:01.055 --> 10:04.234
Trying to get my fuck on.
You know what I'm saying?

10:05.394 --> 10:06.143
Kenny,

10:07.010 --> 10:10.037
If you think that I'm gonna hook up
with you after all this time.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.838
Then you've lost your god damned mind.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.400
Your tits are great.

10:19.014 --> 10:21.198
Kenny Powers in my school!

10:23.274 --> 10:26.358
It is a true pleasure to meet you.
I'm just a huge fan.

10:26.509 --> 10:28.060
Charles Kutler,
principal.

10:28.314 --> 10:31.733
- Big boss man, OK.
- I'll guess so.

10:32.259 --> 10:34.441
When I heard that you
were gonna be subbing here,

10:34.569 --> 10:36.140
I almost lost my mind.

10:37.020 --> 10:38.341
That's good for you.

10:38.466 --> 10:40.780
There's something you need
to know about, Kenny.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.738
You're not the only athlete around here.

10:42.862 --> 10:44.716
I happen to be training for a triathlon.

10:44.845 --> 10:45.451
So,

10:45.602 --> 10:49.040
running every morning, swimming and
cycling. You know all about that, right?

10:49.335 --> 10:50.662
No, actually I don't.

10:50.782 --> 10:53.846
I play real sports,
not trying to be the best at exercising.

10:54.819 --> 10:57.219
- Fuck is guy.
- This guy...

10:57.624 --> 10:59.802

- Hilarious.

11:01.139 --> 11:04.209
Let's get your paperwork started. I'll

11:04.329 --> 11:07.315
How about this? How about

11:07.445 --> 11:09.758
I must stay around here
and catch up with April.

11:09.909 --> 11:11.341
You know April?

11:12.642 --> 11:15.188
- We went to High School together.
- We used to date.

11:15.403 --> 11:16.715
You used to date?

11:17.447 --> 11:20.711
April? You never told me
you dated Kenny Powers?

11:20.842 --> 11:21.489
Well.

11:21.609 --> 11:24.310
- That is so cool!
- Yes, it's a little too early to tell

11:24.441 --> 11:26.424
but it looks like
the sparks are still flying.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.159
- God...
- I'm all get up in it.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.372
That's not funny.

11:30.492 --> 11:33.447
- You're hilarious.
- You're hilarious.

11:35.043 --> 11:36.297
You know what, I...

11:37.152 --> 11:38.756
I am serious.

11:38.876 --> 11:41.751
I forgot to tell you I'm
engaged now.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.079
Bullshit!

11:44.400 --> 11:47.497
You're engaged?
You're right, who are you engaged to?

11:48.218 --> 11:49.415
- To me!
- Yeah.

11:49.862 --> 11:50.997
We're engaged.

11:51.833 --> 11:54.218
May 11th, save the date because
Kenny Powers

11:54.338 --> 11:56.051
is definitely coming to my wedding.

11:56.171 --> 11:58.312
That's not negotiable,
we'll find a room.

12:08.892 --> 12:09.754
What's up?

12:10.771 --> 12:11.981
I'm Kenny Powers.

12:12.558 --> 12:15.808

Now this time, I'd like to fill
any questions anybody have,

12:27.918 --> 12:29.302
this is the time to do it.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.533
- You! Big kid.
- Do we have to run a mile?

12:33.050 --> 12:35.589
I'm talking about me,
I'll answer questions about me

12:35.719 --> 12:37.545
personally,
as a superstar.

12:38.232 --> 12:41.259
You know you got moment in time
here with an American icon.

12:41.379 --> 12:44.341
And you're gonna waste it asking
a question about the fucking mile?

12:44.631 --> 12:47.118
Who's next? Who's got
something else for me here? You.

12:47.644 --> 12:50.187
When you did steroids,
they make your balls shrink?

12:50.739 --> 12:51.907
You think that's funny?

12:52.041 --> 12:55.198
How about I show my balls right here,
and you could tell me if they shrunk.

12:55.362 --> 12:57.849
No, for your information
I have full size balls.

12:58.393 --> 12:59.435
Next question.

12:59.992 --> 13:01.574
Is it true you were in jail?

13:01.867 --> 13:04.285
- No, babe, rehab.
- Did you hurt yourself?

13:05.048 --> 13:06.367
No I didn't hurt myself.

13:06.518 --> 13:09.207
Cause coach Bruce said after
his back surgery, he has gone rehab.

13:10.928 --> 13:13.379
Yeah I hurt myself.
I hurt my nose.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.590
All right, got time for one more.
Timid kid!

13:17.462 --> 13:19.123
My dad said you ruin baseball.

13:19.552 --> 13:22.305
You know what, I can already tell
that I don't like you.

13:22.582 --> 13:24.134
And I'm probably not gonna like you.

13:24.254 --> 13:26.481
No matter how many pull up
or pushups you do.

13:27.129 --> 13:29.564
If anybody want to pickle
anybody in class,

13:30.052 --> 13:32.452
Aim for him, because
I ain't watching.

13:33.074 --> 13:36.129
And Terence
is in a handicapped stall,

13:36.403 --> 13:38.825
with his pants around his ankles,

13:42.163 --> 13:45.026
- And that is why I don't drink.
- God, and that is why I love you.

13:45.146 --> 13:47.425
Hey I don't mean
to break up a good time here

13:47.746 --> 13:49.648
but, I just saw 2 boys
raping a 6th grade.

13:49.768 --> 13:51.040
- What?
- Raping...

13:51.747 --> 13:53.017
I'm just kidding.

13:54.074 --> 13:56.712
- Do you mind if I pony up in here?
- Sure, have a seat.

13:57.042 --> 13:59.315
I don't know if you've met
everybody yet or not?

13:59.467 --> 14:02.689
- But let's get some introduction.
- I know this piece of shit.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.352
Your racist ass!

14:08.773 --> 14:09.523
Well.

14:10.322 --> 14:11.317
That was...

14:11.437 --> 14:13.834
Mrs. Maholick. She teaches civics and...

14:13.963 --> 14:15.854
Of course you already know
Miss Buchanon.

14:15.974 --> 14:18.782
And you got Mr. Nesbond,
our drama teacher.

14:18.912 --> 14:20.674
Mrs. Jones, she teaches English,

14:20.794 --> 14:22.845
And our band teacher down here,
Mr. Janowsky.

14:22.975 --> 14:25.243
We already know each other too.

14:26.682 --> 14:29.208
- We do?
- Yeah, it's me Stevie.

14:29.665 --> 14:30.944
Stevie Janowsky.

14:31.518 --> 14:33.337
We went to high school together.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.996
- I was a drum major.
- What the fuck is that?

14:37.992 --> 14:40.253
I led the home marching band.

14:40.404 --> 14:42.400
Okay, I know,
I made those tee shirts

14:42.520 --> 14:45.533
when you went to State, and I got
everybody to wear them at the pep rally.

14:45.716 --> 14:48.100
You remember that? All the matching
tee shirts everybody wore?

14:48.230 --> 14:51.309
Am I supposed to remember every
motherfucker I've ever met before?

14:52.537 --> 14:53.716
I don't know I just...

14:53.867 --> 14:56.749
- 'cause the teachers were all matched.
- Sorry, nothing, OK.

14:56.869 --> 14:58.409
I don't remember you dude.

14:59.172 --> 15:01.125
I've got lots of memories in my life,

15:01.292 --> 15:03.093
and sometimes you kinda have to

15:03.461 --> 15:06.038
dump the small ones
to make room for the bigger ones.

15:07.963 --> 15:08.993
But sometimes,

15:09.155 --> 15:12.337
when you try to dump the smaller one
you think they're gone, but they're not.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.105
They're sitting there,

15:14.225 --> 15:17.058
waiting the pick up
exactly where they left off.

15:17.814 --> 15:20.969
No matter if there are new memories
sitting in their way or not.

15:23.675 --> 15:26.767
Personally, I hate it when new memories
get in the way of old ones.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.471
All right,
so let's me get this straight. So

15:30.593 --> 15:34.240
 I'm gonna pay for a blow job, and
I gotta pay for goddam hotel room too?

15:34.514 --> 15:37.783
That just seems like I'm spending too
much money for nothing. I got a house.

15:37.903 --> 15:40.952
You could just get your ass over here
and do the blow job here.

15:42.595 --> 15:44.538
Hey, this one is done too.

15:44.658 --> 15:46.746
- Could you take that as well?
- Thank you.

15:47.201 --> 15:48.693
I'll wear a Scream mask.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.348
The mask from Scream.

15:51.001 --> 15:52.536
While I do you from behind.

15:52.887 --> 15:53.637
Hello?

15:54.542 --> 15:55.192
Hey!

15:55.744 --> 15:56.594
Cassie,

15:57.266 --> 15:58.918
your cell phone
blows!

15:59.493 --> 16:02.165
It's crazy just like being out,
in the real working world,

16:02.375 --> 16:04.543
working a real job,
like getting out of the house,

16:04.672 --> 16:07.404
it just exhausts you.
It really does. It's exhaustic.

16:07.731 --> 16:10.142
If you could keep focus
on keeping your area clean?

16:10.272 --> 16:12.016
- No problem.
- I'd appreciate that.

16:12.382 --> 16:14.533
Can I ask you a question hypothetical?

16:15.874 --> 16:18.080
When you were engaged
to get marry to Dustin,

16:18.209 --> 16:21.508
if somebody else would asked you out,
like what would you've said?

16:22.104 --> 16:25.449
Well, I was pregnant when Dustin
asked me to marry him, so...

16:25.569 --> 16:27.536
Right, yeah,
who's gonna want to stick that?

16:28.496 --> 16:31.826
Well, let's pretend that you
weren't pregers, you were just normal.

16:32.044 --> 16:34.660
And, that dude
asked you out.

16:35.585 --> 16:36.925
OK, well.

16:38.906 --> 16:41.487
Kenny, I think I would say no.
I mean,

16:42.814 --> 16:43.971
it's true love.

16:44.249 --> 16:45.423
You know when one heart

16:45.705 --> 16:47.811
connects with another heart, it's,

16:48.164 --> 16:50.879
sort of magical.
I really hope for you someday.

16:50.999 --> 16:52.708
Wait.
Shut up for a second.

16:55.261 --> 16:57.405
No, no!
Get down!

16:57.525 --> 17:00.356
Get your ass down right now!
Hop down your ignorant ass!

17:00.476 --> 17:02.390
Kenny, you cannot
talk to my son like that!

17:02.510 --> 17:05.606
Get out, get out of here.
Get your ass down Hand

17:05.736 --> 17:07.724
- ruining my goddam handle bars.
- What's going on?

17:07.845 --> 17:10.159
- He just swore at Wayne.
- Why you're swearing to Wayne?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.997
Why you're taking her side when
he's the one who has been wrong to you?

17:13.117 --> 17:15.680
- Was just sitting on his jet ski.
- Was just sitting on his jet ski.

17:15.824 --> 17:19.036
- That's why you're swearing at him?
- I will continue to swear Dustin,

17:19.156 --> 17:21.219
this jet ski ain't a god damn toy!

17:21.671 --> 17:23.660
- Yes, it is.
- Do you know what would have happen

17:23.790 --> 17:26.460
if he would have dry
accelerate this jet ski on land?

17:26.601 --> 17:29.210
He would have ruined it.
You would have fucking ruined it!

17:29.335 --> 17:32.220
Kenny, if you're really strap for cash,
sell the jet ski.

17:32.455 --> 17:34.245
I don't tell you
what to do with your money.

17:34.365 --> 17:36.414
Don't fucking tell me
what to do with mine, OK?

17:36.534 --> 17:40.019
Cassie, do not stare me those dead eyes,
you jerk bitch!

17:40.228 --> 17:43.017
- You are an asshole!
- Ultimately, I'll regret saying that.

17:43.137 --> 17:45.861
- That was an horrible thing to say.
- Watch your fucking mouth, all right.

17:46.012 --> 17:47.880
It's just:
I'm Kenny Powers!

17:48.875 --> 17:50.176
I'm sorry, OK?

17:50.296 --> 17:52.885
I've been told that I have problems
expressing my emotions.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.359
And so I yell!
So, I'm very sorry,

17:55.488 --> 17:58.751
I don't mean to offend you Wayne.
You have fucking pissed me off.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.623
But I'm just very upset right now.

18:01.489 --> 18:04.539
Honestly, it's probably better
if I just leave now.

18:04.831 --> 18:07.547
So I'm gonna go ahead and go.
But I'm not gonna stop yelling.

18:07.714 --> 18:09.841
Because then, that will mean
I lost the fight.

18:10.003 --> 18:11.327
So, fuck you all!

18:11.447 --> 18:14.153
I'm sorry, leave it to you on the mad,
I'm out!

18:15.294 --> 18:16.440
Where you going?

18:17.609 --> 18:19.866
I'm going to Chabooms!

18:20.647 --> 18:22.937
The jet ski is a piece of fucking shit,
by the way.

18:42.960 --> 18:43.875
I know you.

18:44.288 --> 18:45.920
I've seen your ass on TV.

18:47.534 --> 18:49.891
And it ain't often
we got many stars in here.

18:51.335 --> 18:53.071
Stars kinda make me...

18:53.510 --> 18:54.699
How do I say it?

18:55.657 --> 18:57.430
A little wet in my pussy.

18:58.183 --> 18:59.974
That's a one way to say, yeah.

19:00.094 --> 19:01.557
Hell no!
Hell no!

19:01.677 --> 19:04.394
- Tracy get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck you Craig!

19:04.786 --> 19:06.136
I'm just talking.

19:06.485 --> 19:09.123
So daddy need a little TNC.

19:09.341 --> 19:12.562
What you need is a shit ton of Altrix.
And you get the hell out of here!

19:16.301 --> 19:16.993
OK!

19:24.983 --> 19:26.404
Powers, in my office.

19:26.677 --> 19:28.271
Let's blow some rails.

19:29.414 --> 19:30.755
Finally motherfuckers.

19:32.518 --> 19:35.168
That was basically college for me,
just you know,

19:35.298 --> 19:37.804
fucking tours widespread
all across the USA.

19:37.924 --> 19:40.730
I don't know much about those guys,
I never fuck a guy too much.

19:40.857 --> 19:42.889
Man, I'll bring you some shit.

19:43.490 --> 19:44.702
Just the choice.

19:44.931 --> 19:47.146
It sounds great,
I would like to I would like the Cds.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.087
All right. Fucking burning...

19:51.217 --> 19:53.945
I've been waiting the all time I've been
here just having a good time,

19:54.065 --> 19:57.028
- I've been having the shitiest time...
- It's so fucking good to see you.

19:57.158 --> 19:59.394
We may be here now,
but we are free...

19:59.570 --> 20:01.772
- They can't take that away from us.
- We're still free,

20:01.892 --> 20:03.371
Shit, I just got a new barbecue

20:04.873 --> 20:07.016
Fuck April Buchanan, she works at the...

20:07.136 --> 20:10.040
at the fucking middle store,
she works there. Is it I gotta go?

20:10.160 --> 20:11.337
April Buchanan's?

20:11.540 --> 20:13.799
Yep, she's engaged
to the fucking principal over there.

20:13.919 --> 20:16.175
Dude, this fucking dip shit that wants
to be me, man.

20:16.337 --> 20:18.386
I mean this girl is just
a bleep on the radar.

20:18.770 --> 20:20.889
A bleep with two big ass tits.

20:23.007 --> 20:26.336
Like two big fucking poppers attached
to a fucking sell out, dude.

21:15.644 --> 21:18.499
So Kenny are you enjoying
working here at Jefferson Davies?

21:19.246 --> 21:20.590
It's awesome.

21:20.795 --> 21:23.042
Kenny, I...
I have called you here for something,

21:23.322 --> 21:25.353
rather serious,
kind upset,

21:26.803 --> 21:28.289
coach Booth died this morning.

21:28.786 --> 21:31.243
They're not sure but they think
he may have taking too many

21:31.364 --> 21:33.794
of the pain-pills
the doctors gave him for his back.

21:34.089 --> 21:35.546
Shit, you can die from that?

21:37.317 --> 21:38.012
Look,

21:38.203 --> 21:40.101
I know you're a
free agent,

21:41.385 --> 21:44.332
but since coach Booth
isn't coming back, I was...

21:44.650 --> 21:45.989
just wondering if,

21:46.162 --> 21:47.011
maybe,

21:47.847 --> 21:49.800
you wanted to come
to this team full time?

21:49.998 --> 21:52.252
I'd love to head you
to the permanent roaster.

21:52.549 --> 21:54.237
At least for the rest of the year.

21:54.435 --> 21:57.032
I mean these kids could really
benefit from having star athlete

21:57.152 --> 21:58.881
such as yourself around, and,

21:59.020 --> 22:00.508
could be good for you as well.

22:01.221 --> 22:03.025
I'm talking,
health insurance,

22:03.222 --> 22:04.271
401, Kenny,

22:04.552 --> 22:06.653
and,
in a few years,

22:07.920 --> 22:09.155
you'll have tenure.

22:10.243 --> 22:12.502
You don't find
a lot of ball player with tenure.

22:13.513 --> 22:14.925
Sleep on it,
OK?

22:15.372 --> 22:17.318
You don't have to make up
your mind right now.

22:18.431 --> 22:20.616
- You want a smoothie?
- No I'm straight.

22:24.362 --> 22:26.267
You know I took April's virginity?

22:26.832 --> 22:27.765
What's that?

22:28.602 --> 22:30.316
I said I don't want a smoothie.

23:00.367 --> 23:03.511
I'm looking for the world
famous Kenny Powers.

23:06.229 --> 23:07.221
Beat it out.

23:09.061 --> 23:12.264
Cutler was asking
all the teachers to pair up,

23:12.521 --> 23:15.063
and... so they can oversee
at school activity,

23:15.183 --> 23:17.707
and I was just here...
I was wondering if maybe...

23:17.827 --> 23:20.795
you would like to pair up with me
and we can head up

23:20.915 --> 23:24.612
- to Candfood river, or... or maybe...
- I ain't doing any of that bullshit.

23:25.193 --> 23:26.080
I think,

23:26.200 --> 23:29.808
I think you have to do
one of them at least.

23:30.074 --> 23:31.401
Fuck this place,

23:31.521 --> 23:33.497
I'm getting out
of this fucking shithole.

23:36.967 --> 23:38.644
Kenny, I just want, well,

23:39.088 --> 23:40.924
I think that it's really great

23:41.714 --> 23:43.109
that you came back home,

23:45.898 --> 23:47.114
'cause sometimes

23:47.849 --> 23:49.328
everyone needs a hero.

23:53.361 --> 23:54.342
And Kenny,

23:55.274 --> 23:56.488
friend to friend,

23:57.265 --> 23:58.577
you are my hero.

23:59.404 --> 24:01.356
And I hope that one day,

24:01.974 --> 24:04.001
you can call me your friend,

24:05.154 --> 24:06.363
like I call you my hero.

24:06.515 --> 24:08.491
Would you please
get the fuck out of here?

24:22.261 --> 24:23.652
Yeah, fuck you.

24:24.364 --> 24:25.575
Fuck you.

24:35.923 --> 24:37.085
What is that?

24:37.628 --> 24:38.876
It's Kenny.

24:41.329 --> 24:42.677
How do you know?

24:44.210 --> 24:45.236
Because I know.

24:46.763 --> 24:47.488
Dustin,

24:48.187 --> 24:51.107
I know it is our Christ
to give indeed to help up family but,

24:51.230 --> 24:52.911
can't we just kill him instead?

24:54.616 --> 24:56.162
I am the elder brother,

24:56.604 --> 24:57.972
no I can't kill him,

24:58.936 --> 25:00.334
but I'll lay his ass out.

25:08.629 --> 25:10.846
Wake the neighborhood off the night.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.974
Fucking burn this fucking house down!

25:15.313 --> 25:17.876
- What the hell are you doing?
- Dustin look at me,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.749
I'm a fucking icon!

25:19.869 --> 25:22.551
- You are fucking up my siding.
- Hey, fuck your siding.

25:22.727 --> 25:24.729
God is taking a dump for my face.

25:24.999 --> 25:27.089
Love of my life.
Don't wanna have sex with me

25:27.209 --> 25:29.697
'cause she's getting married
to some smoothie in fairy.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.347
The only job I got

25:31.527 --> 25:34.951
is teaching a bunch of fucking
piss-pants how to tie their shoes.

25:35.309 --> 25:37.477
This is me Dustin, take a picture.

25:37.730 --> 25:41.250
I know the last few years have
been tough, but come on man,

25:41.412 --> 25:43.545
now you are living with us
regular folks, big deal.

25:43.705 --> 25:45.806
You act like this is
a prison sentence or something.

25:45.966 --> 25:48.859
I'm sorry if life here isn't glits
and glamour you're used to, but

25:48.982 --> 25:51.218
you can't just run around
acting like a baby.

25:53.104 --> 25:55.677
You used to be someone I liked
being around, and now,

25:56.259 --> 25:57.359
you're not.

26:02.369 --> 26:03.902
That's fucking sad, man.

26:08.904 --> 26:11.640
I mean you just nailed it,
you just hit it on the head.

26:12.923 --> 26:14.827
You said I wouldn't get back
on top again?

26:14.954 --> 26:17.108
No I'm saying,
need to stop being an asshole.

26:17.281 --> 26:19.975
Yeah man, I've got to remember
that I'm a winner man,

26:20.114 --> 26:22.583
I need to remember that I am
better than everybody else.

26:22.802 --> 26:24.283
That's not what I'm saying at all.

26:24.412 --> 26:26.420
Fuck man,
I'm an old bullet proof tiger, dude.

26:26.582 --> 26:30.060
If is everyone in this town has forget
who I am, maybe it's time I remind'em.

26:30.295 --> 26:33.013
Maybe it's time I remind
everybody just who the fuck.

26:33.142 --> 26:36.138
- Kenny Powers is.
- Knock that shit off!

26:36.395 --> 26:39.023
Brother, don't be sad OK,
don't be bad,

26:39.619 --> 26:41.196
it's me,
your brother.

26:41.856 --> 26:44.251
You've help me see the light,
now I'm help you.

26:44.673 --> 26:45.927
You see that "Jet ski"?

26:46.844 --> 26:49.069
Sellin'it.
I'm sellin'the jet ski.

26:49.758 --> 26:51.496
- Bullshit
- Bullshit nothing, man!

26:51.616 --> 26:54.650
That jet ski is a toy,
it's a distraction and, right now,

26:54.770 --> 26:56.575
Kenny Powers does not need that,

26:56.737 --> 26:58.452
Kenny Powers needs a focus, OK?

26:58.783 --> 27:01.806
Besides man, that can help your family,
it can help pay for bills,

27:01.926 --> 27:03.631
Kenny Powers is Back!

27:03.869 --> 27:05.518
KNOCK EM DEAD.

28:03.685 --> 28:06.395
Excuse me students
for this morning announcement.

28:06.670 --> 28:08.388
The junior out fame comedy

28:08.508 --> 28:11.046
will hold an organizational
meeting after school.

28:12.074 --> 28:14.670
- The year book money is now...
- Get away big shit. Hop up.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.623
Hop up, dick wee!
Is this thing on?

28:18.151 --> 28:19.926
I just push the fucking button.

28:20.088 --> 28:22.816
They can hear me right now?
Hello school can you hear me?

28:22.945 --> 28:25.342
Can you hear me?
Good morning, students,

28:25.907 --> 28:26.760
teachers,

28:26.883 --> 28:29.824
faculty members,
lunch ladies, janitors,

28:30.021 --> 28:32.361
this is...
Kenny Powers,

28:32.564 --> 28:35.923
professional base-ball player,
and I got some I want to say.

28:36.869 --> 28:40.301
All of you mother fuckers
think you know who Kenny Powers is.

28:40.579 --> 28:43.307
But all I'm here today to tell you all
you don't know shit.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.531
It comes a time in every man life

28:46.833 --> 28:49.263
when he's got
to take a look at himself in the mirror,

28:49.383 --> 28:51.896
and decides just exactly who he is.

28:52.445 --> 28:55.066
All I've come to that crossroad
and I've decided.

28:56.770 --> 28:58.464
Kenny Powers is a man,

28:58.894 --> 29:00.536
Kenny Powers is an athlete,

29:00.991 --> 29:03.273
Kenny Powers
is a lover,

29:04.232 --> 29:05.743
but the most he is,

29:06.184 --> 29:08.592
I mean the thing
that Kenny Powers is the most,

29:09.156 --> 29:10.660
he's a goddamn champion.

29:11.018 --> 29:13.634
And the one thing
a champion does not do,

29:13.873 --> 29:15.078
is fucking quit.

29:15.508 --> 29:16.821
A true champion

29:17.129 --> 29:18.674
faces his enemies,

29:19.986 --> 29:22.495
- and he conquers'em.
- OK... maybe we should...

29:24.159 --> 29:27.590
And that is why
I'm here today to tell you all,

29:28.097 --> 29:29.674
that Kenny Powers

29:29.851 --> 29:31.083
is officially,

29:31.774 --> 29:34.690
accepting the position of PE coach,

29:35.018 --> 29:37.170
here at Jefferson Davies middle school.

29:38.065 --> 29:40.597
That is,
until the majors call me back up.

29:41.155 --> 29:43.221
So let's get the teaching on!

29:48.720 --> 29:49.661
I'm out!

29:50.804 --> 29:53.215
It's OK,
settle down everyone, that was,

29:53.484 --> 29:56.588
mister Powers using some language
that a bold eagle would never uses.

29:56.806 --> 29:59.883
All right everybody, show's over,
let's get back to work.

30:03.150 --> 30:04.096
Miss Buchanon.

30:04.586 --> 30:05.575
Yes honey?

30:23.659 --> 30:26.197
Where the fuck is that dude going?

30:26.354 --> 30:27.961
It's still the first period.

31:08.084 --> 31:10.494
Fuck you Kenny piece of shit.
