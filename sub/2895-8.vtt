You really know him.

00:03.081 --> 00:04.381
I really do.

00:04.499 --> 00:06.333
- Never.
- No.

00:06.501 --> 00:08.135
Why not?

00:08.219 --> 00:10.003
Because you can never go back.

00:10.138 --> 00:11.805
Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

00:11.923 --> 00:13.284
through Switzerland
and the Caymans

00:13.391 --> 00:14.871
before it comes out
on the other side.

00:14.893 --> 00:16.093
You're obligated to report it.

00:16.227 --> 00:17.644
I didn't,
and I'm not going to.

00:17.779 --> 00:18.679
What are you talking about?

00:18.813 --> 00:20.147
Rachel, hey.
Logan and I kissed.

00:20.265 --> 00:22.933
Mike, no.
Please.

00:23.067 --> 00:24.947
When I said that it
didn't matter what I do next

00:25.069 --> 00:28.739
because I have you,
I was wrong because we're done.

00:28.889 --> 00:30.524
That's your fee
for putting this deal

00:30.692 --> 00:31.942

You son of a bitch.

00:32.058 --> 00:33.410
You didn't bring me here
for you to sign on the arrows.

00:33.561 --> 00:34.778
You brought me here for me
to sign on the arrows.

00:34.913 --> 00:36.246
Yep.

00:36.364 --> 00:38.415
You cannot take a job
with that man.

00:38.566 --> 00:39.616
What are you gonna
do about it?

00:39.751 --> 00:41.335
I hired Mike Ross
back at the firm.

00:41.419 --> 00:43.453
- What?
- You're really gonna drop me?

00:43.588 --> 00:44.588
You're damn right I am.

00:44.739 --> 00:48.091
I never want to see you again.

00:48.242 --> 00:49.843
- Are you back here?
- No, no.

00:49.928 --> 00:53.714
I'm--stay somewhere for a while.
Mike-

00:53.881 --> 00:55.202
Rachel,
whatever you're gonna say,

00:55.249 --> 00:57.184
now is not the time to say it.

00:57.268 --> 00:59.386
I'm coming back
to work tomorrow.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.721
If you can't accept that,

01:00.855 --> 01:04.558
then whatever you were gonna
say to me won't matter.

Rachel, I'm gonna tell you
something I've never told you.

03:18.943 --> 03:22.529
I slept with Harvey.

03:22.663 --> 03:26.450
Oh, my God.

03:26.584 --> 03:27.584
But you told me that--

03:27.668 --> 03:29.586
I know what I told you.

03:29.737 --> 03:31.421
It was once,
and I never would have done it

03:31.539 --> 03:33.874

he left the D.A.'s office,

03:35.960 --> 03:40.680
and...it happened.

03:40.765 --> 03:41.882
And then, the next time
I saw him,

03:42.016 --> 03:43.467
he wanted me to come with him
to the firm,

03:43.601 --> 03:45.135
and I did, and that was that.

03:45.252 --> 03:46.887
Would you have wanted
a relationship with him?

03:47.021 --> 03:49.556
I would have wanted to try,

03:49.690 --> 03:52.859
but he wasn't ready.

03:52.944 --> 03:55.729
And if I had pushed him
to be ready,

You never get in this early,

I get in every single day.

happens that this morning,

here this early this morning

and I am burying it
in the bowels of these files.

05:45.006 --> 05:47.307

I am putting these files

05:47.425 --> 05:50.343
deep in the bowels
of our storage.

bowels.

the Gillis Industries takeover.

06:21.509 --> 06:22.590
Oh, I don't want the files.

06:22.627 --> 06:24.127

to fight that or comply.

or should I?

06:28.415 --> 06:30.934
It's not a subpoena, Harvey.
It's a search warrant.

06:31.085 --> 06:33.186
So you're gonna give me
all the files,

06:33.304 --> 06:36.222
or you're gonna head downtown
with these two fine gentlemen.

since the Reagan Administration.

of you getting to a judge

is gonna get me to leave?

Some guy with a soul patch
was sitting at my desk.

08:25.803 --> 08:27.587
That's because
it's not your desk anymore,

to pull off a soul patch.

08:29.640 --> 08:30.723
I dispute that.

08:30.874 --> 08:32.634
Are you even capable
of growing a soul patch?

08:32.676 --> 08:35.678
I had a goatee
my sophomore year of never.

08:35.846 --> 08:37.147
Look, it's not your desk
anymore

08:37.231 --> 08:38.648

of the bullpen now.

08:38.765 --> 08:39.933
Which other side?

08:40.049 --> 08:42.090
The other side. Like,
not the side that you were on.

08:42.102 --> 08:43.352

or away from the door?

talking about?

08:45.773 --> 08:47.533

Just shut up and keep walking.

08:57.751 --> 08:59.085
- Are you serious?
- I know.

08:59.236 --> 09:00.420
I fought it tooth and nail.

09:00.571 --> 09:01.921
I mean, if it were up to me,
you'd be setting up shop

09:02.072 --> 09:03.256
in the file room.

You did this, didn't you?

to do,

that you were coming back,

taking numbers

their work.

- Thanks, Donna.
- You already thanked me.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.314
Not for that.

- Come on.

Somebody had to pick up
your slack

09:56.810 --> 09:58.845
while you were shiting the bed
on Wall Street.

09:58.979 --> 10:00.980
Which is why it's good to be
back here where there's a shity

10:01.098 --> 10:03.933
lawyer like you
to make me look good.

10:04.018 --> 10:05.602
It's good to see you.

10:05.736 --> 10:06.736
Thanks, Katrina.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.738
Don't thank me.
Thank Louis.

10:08.856 --> 10:10.857
Oh, I did
when he hired me back.

10:10.974 --> 10:13.993
I'm sure you did, and I'm sure
he would never tell you this,

10:14.111 --> 10:18.364
but I wanted you to know what he
gave up to bring you back here.

10:18.499 --> 10:20.950
- What are you talking about?
- Jessica gave Louis one wish

10:21.085 --> 10:22.335
when he closed Forstman,

10:22.453 --> 10:24.954
and he had a whole plan
to manage his work schedule

10:25.089 --> 10:27.790
so he could try
to reignite things with Sheila.

10:27.875 --> 10:30.543
And he gave all that up
because he cared more about you

10:30.678 --> 10:33.546
than he did about himself.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.967
- I didn't know that.
- Well, like I said,

10:38.135 --> 10:40.003
I thought you should.

10:48.979 --> 10:50.813
Welcome back.

11:04.328 --> 11:05.712
I have court in ten minutes.

11:05.862 --> 11:07.664
Now, what are you three doing
in front of my face?

11:07.798 --> 11:09.499
We're here because he showed
up at our offices this morning

11:09.633 --> 11:10.917
with a search warrant.

11:11.051 --> 11:12.168
A search warrant,
I'm sorry to say,

11:12.336 --> 11:13.636
you have no authority to stop.

11:13.754 --> 11:15.505
Yes, you do
because he deliberately

11:15.639 --> 11:17.340
went outside your authority
to get it.

11:17.474 --> 11:18.591
- What?
- Your Honor,

11:18.726 --> 11:20.059
I went to a different judge
because my office

11:20.210 --> 11:21.644
tried to reach you,
but you were unavailable.

11:21.762 --> 11:23.346
Check with your clerk.
There's a record of the call.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.200
Did you make it
from Judge Franklin's house?

11:25.215 --> 11:28.101
Because he's the one who signed
the warrant at 8:30 last night.

11:28.235 --> 11:30.486
The same judge you play golf
with every Thursday.

11:30.571 --> 11:33.022
And Barack Obama plays
basketball with Eric Holder.

11:33.107 --> 11:34.190
Let's arrest everybody.

11:34.358 --> 11:36.192
I'm not interested
in everybody.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.744
I'm interested in
why you went around me.

11:37.894 --> 11:39.334
Because I needed a warrant
last night

11:39.413 --> 11:41.497
to stop them from destroying
evidence this morning.

11:41.615 --> 11:43.783
And the day someone's guilty
until proven innocent

11:43.900 --> 11:46.502
is the day that argument
holds an ounce of water.

11:46.587 --> 11:48.087
Better get your glass, Harvey.

11:48.238 --> 11:49.589
That day's coming
sooner than you think.

11:49.707 --> 11:51.541
Well, it's not today.

11:51.625 --> 11:52.905
I'm revoking your search warrant

11:52.926 --> 11:54.206
until we can have
a full hearing.

11:54.211 --> 11:55.611
- Your Honor--
- Now, that's enough.

11:55.713 --> 11:58.598
If you want to go rummaging
around in a law firm's files,

11:58.749 --> 12:01.100
you better come to me
with more than innuendo.

12:04.805 --> 12:05.805
I better get going.

12:05.939 --> 12:07.640
I have to look up
the word "innuendo,"

12:07.758 --> 12:12.228
if you know what I mean.

12:12.313 --> 12:15.231
Harvey, I'm telling you, that
man is not going to stop coming.

12:15.366 --> 12:17.867
I'm going to suggest
something radical here.

12:17.985 --> 12:19.319
And what is that?

12:19.436 --> 12:21.571
We could just give him
what he wants.

12:21.739 --> 12:23.289
The fact is
we've got nothing to hide.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.575
Harvey, I don't care
that we have nothing to hide.

12:25.659 --> 12:27.377
A police officer
follows a car long enough,

12:27.461 --> 12:28.828
he's gonna find
a busted taillight.

12:28.945 --> 12:31.497
And even if he doesn't,
he's gonna bust it himself.

12:31.632 --> 12:32.715
Well, what are you
suggesting we do?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.584
I don't know,
but this whole witch hunt

12:34.668 --> 12:37.337
is about Cahill thinking
you colluded with Mike Ross.

12:37.471 --> 12:38.471
So now that he's back,

12:38.622 --> 12:40.173
why don't you collude
with that fraud

12:40.307 --> 12:42.175
and get us the hell
out of this?

12:48.193 --> 12:50.644
See you got yourself
an office.

12:51.009 --> 12:53.027
Yeah, it's not as nice
as the one I had, but--

12:53.145 --> 12:54.529
It's still a step up.

12:54.647 --> 12:56.815
You mean because it's smaller
or because the view is worse?

12:56.949 --> 12:59.984
I mean
because it's my old office.

13:00.152 --> 13:01.286
You're shiting me.

13:01.404 --> 13:02.954
Look in the top left drawer.

13:09.328 --> 13:12.330
- You're serious.
- I am.

13:12.465 --> 13:13.581
Donna said she did this.

13:13.716 --> 13:15.700
She had the idea
to give you an office.

13:15.835 --> 13:17.385
It was my idea
to give you this office.

13:17.536 --> 13:18.816
And it just
happened to be empty.

13:18.921 --> 13:19.921
Something like that.

13:19.922 --> 13:21.840
Right.

13:21.974 --> 13:24.809
It's good to have you back
where you belong.

13:24.927 --> 13:26.594
Okay, enough fun.

13:26.729 --> 13:28.513
Sean Cahill's trying
to go through every file

13:28.647 --> 13:30.348
we have on the takeover.
You in?

13:30.433 --> 13:32.066
I sure as hell
don't want to do an amicus brief

13:32.184 --> 13:33.685
for Paul Porter.
Good.

13:33.853 --> 13:35.270
Then figure out a way
to keep Cahill

13:35.404 --> 13:36.771
from getting his hands
on our documents,

13:36.906 --> 13:38.857
and do it fast
because we don't have much time.

13:39.024 --> 13:40.575
Harvey, have you considered

13:40.693 --> 13:42.777
the fact that he's been
going after us for collusion,

13:42.912 --> 13:45.096
and we didn't collude?
What are you getting at?

13:45.197 --> 13:47.165
Why don't we just give
him all the files?

13:47.266 --> 13:48.266
We have nothing to hide,

13:48.400 --> 13:49.784
and fighting him makes it
look like we do.

13:49.919 --> 13:51.079
That's what I said
to Jessica.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.280
You know what she said to me?

13:52.338 --> 13:54.005
"A cop follows a car
long enough,

13:54.089 --> 13:55.540
"he's gonna find
a busted taillight.

13:55.624 --> 13:57.675
And even if he doesn't,
he's gonna bust it himself."

13:57.793 --> 14:00.929
[Sighs]

14:01.079 --> 14:03.181
Speaking of Jessica,

14:03.299 --> 14:08.603
you never told me how she felt
about me coming back.

14:08.754 --> 14:11.606
Find a way to beat Cahill,
and then ask me that again.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.148
You just had to get
to him first, didn't you?

14:20.282 --> 14:21.282
What, did you give him a lock
of your hair?

14:21.433 --> 14:22.784
What are you talking about,
Louis?

14:22.935 --> 14:24.486
You think I didn't notice
you conveniently put Henderson

14:24.603 --> 14:26.287
in my old office so you
can give Mike your old office?

14:26.405 --> 14:27.405
For your information,

14:27.490 --> 14:30.492
Louis, Henderson
begged for your old office

14:30.626 --> 14:32.410
because he thinks
you're the best attorney

14:32.578 --> 14:33.995
that's ever walked the face
of this earth.

14:34.129 --> 14:35.880
Oh, bull--really?

14:35.998 --> 14:38.633
Absolutely.

14:38.784 --> 14:41.553
So you're not just saying
that to butter me up

14:41.670 --> 14:43.421
so I'll let this go?

14:43.556 --> 14:44.756
Hand to God,

14:44.890 --> 14:46.724
or as Henderson would say,

14:46.809 --> 14:48.927
"hand to Louis."
Okay, then.

14:49.061 --> 14:53.097
Just as long as you're not
trying to pull one over on me.

14:53.232 --> 14:54.899
That Henderson is going places.

15:00.773 --> 15:05.076
Don't move.

15:05.194 --> 15:06.828
What are you doing?

15:06.979 --> 15:09.247
Taking a mental picture
of this moment.

15:09.365 --> 15:10.782
- Louis, that's not a mental--
- [Clicks tongue]

15:10.916 --> 15:13.451
Mike Ross, the prodigal son,
returns.

15:13.619 --> 15:14.869
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

15:15.004 --> 15:19.374
And Louis, I want to thank
you again for bringing me back.

15:19.508 --> 15:20.925
I'm never gonna forget it.

15:21.043 --> 15:24.462
And if there is every anything
that I can do to repay you--

15:24.547 --> 15:25.964
Mike, please.

15:26.048 --> 15:27.181
Don't insult me.

15:27.332 --> 15:30.518
You do not owe me,
and if you really care about me,

15:30.669 --> 15:34.522
you will never mention
repaying me with a favor again.

15:34.673 --> 15:36.641
- Really appreciate it, Louis.
- Good.

15:36.725 --> 15:38.810
Now, I need you to drop
whatever it is you're doing--

15:38.944 --> 15:40.464
Oh, Louis,
I can't drop what I'm doing.

15:40.563 --> 15:41.896
Harvey just asked me to--

15:42.031 --> 15:43.064
What do you mean you
can't drop what you're doing?

15:43.198 --> 15:44.315
I just brought you back here.
You owe me.

15:44.450 --> 15:45.650
You just told me
never to mention that again.

15:45.784 --> 15:47.118
What, do you think
I meant that?

15:47.236 --> 15:47.986
I said that because that's
what people say.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.487
Now, what you say is,

15:49.622 --> 15:50.572
"screw what Harvey
asked me to do.

15:50.689 --> 15:51.623
"I don't give a shit about him.

15:51.740 --> 15:53.180
I only give a shit about you,
Louis."

15:53.292 --> 15:54.375
Louis, this isn't
just for Harvey.

15:54.493 --> 15:55.493
It's for the firm, okay?

15:55.628 --> 15:56.744
Sean Cahill--
Bullshit.

15:56.879 --> 15:58.559
That's just the kind of thing
that Harvey--

15:58.697 --> 16:00.465
did you just--did you just--

16:00.549 --> 16:01.499
did you just say, "Sean Cahill"?

16:01.634 --> 16:02.834
Yeah.
He's trying to get access

16:02.868 --> 16:04.168
to our files
on the Gillis takeover.

16:04.253 --> 16:06.504
Why didn't you
say that in the first place?

16:06.589 --> 16:08.056
We need to fight
this son of a bitch

16:08.206 --> 16:09.340
with the full force
of the law, Mike.

16:09.475 --> 16:11.076
- That's what I was doing.
- Then, do it.

16:11.143 --> 16:12.176
You don't have time
to work on this case.

16:12.344 --> 16:14.262
I need to bring it to Katrina.

16:14.396 --> 16:16.848
- Louis, are you okay?
- No, I am not okay.

16:16.982 --> 16:18.382
Mike, this is an attack
on our firm,

16:18.434 --> 16:20.435
and an attack against one of us
is an attack against all of us.

16:20.569 --> 16:22.236
Get the hell to work.

16:26.358 --> 16:27.609
We're in trouble.

16:27.743 --> 16:29.911
Sean Cahill is trying
to get the Gillis files.

16:30.029 --> 16:32.196
Louis,
you buried that document.

16:32.331 --> 16:33.581
You don't understand.

16:33.732 --> 16:35.533
The SEC is gonna have
these files forever,

16:35.668 --> 16:37.348
and eventually,
they're gonna see the money

16:37.419 --> 16:39.020
went in one place
and came out the other,

16:39.071 --> 16:42.540
and I'm the person who did it.

16:42.675 --> 16:44.042
What do you need me to do?

16:44.126 --> 16:46.511
I want you to cover up
my tracks as best you can.

16:46.595 --> 16:47.929
And what are you going to do?

16:48.080 --> 16:48.963
I'm going to try to fix it
so the goddamn thing

16:49.098 --> 16:50.765
never happened
in the first place.

16:59.224 --> 17:00.608
What are you doing here?

17:00.759 --> 17:02.894
I didn't think we had
any further business to discuss.

17:03.028 --> 17:04.311
We don't.
We just have a problem

17:04.445 --> 17:05.980
with the business we just did.

17:06.098 --> 17:07.858
Are you here to shake me down
for more money?

17:07.866 --> 17:09.067
I'm here to give it all back.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.069
- Louis, I told you--
- No, just listen to me, okay.

17:11.203 --> 17:14.238
The SEC--they're trying
to get access to our files.

17:14.406 --> 17:17.541
That happens, they see that
your payout was routed offshore

17:17.626 --> 17:18.866
and you didn't pay taxes on it.

17:18.877 --> 17:21.128
They'll see
I haven't paid taxes.

17:21.279 --> 17:23.580
I have until the third quarter
of two years from now

17:23.715 --> 17:25.133
to report that income,

17:25.282 --> 17:26.751
and if I need to, I will.

17:26.885 --> 17:28.553
Are you crazy?

17:28.671 --> 17:29.971
They're not idiots.

17:30.122 --> 17:33.057
Nobody has money wired through
a Swiss bank and the Caymans

17:33.175 --> 17:35.093
if they're planning
on reporting it to the IRS.

17:35.177 --> 17:37.895
That's not proof of anything,
and the only thing

17:37.980 --> 17:39.981
they'll definitely find if they
get a look at those files

17:40.132 --> 17:41.315
is that you embezzled money.

17:41.433 --> 17:42.900
So get out of my office.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.102
Listen to me, goddamn it.

17:44.236 --> 17:47.989
We need to undo this deal.

17:48.140 --> 17:49.907
I tell you what, Louis.

17:50.025 --> 17:54.829
Have a seat.

17:54.947 --> 17:57.615
You want peace of mind?

17:57.783 --> 18:01.002
Draw up the same paperwork
we already signed.

18:01.153 --> 18:04.422
Only this time, have Harvey
sign it instead of you.

18:04.506 --> 18:05.707
What?

18:05.824 --> 18:06.708
You're the one
who said you'd go to the ends

18:06.842 --> 18:07.759
of the earth
to stick it to him.

18:07.876 --> 18:09.076
Taking his client
is one thing.

18:09.094 --> 18:10.094
Framing him for a felony?

18:10.095 --> 18:11.129
That's another.

18:11.263 --> 18:12.714
It's your call.

18:12.848 --> 18:14.348
Use your name,
replace it with his,

18:14.499 --> 18:15.850
I don't give a shit.

18:16.001 --> 18:19.854
But the deal
is staying in place.

18:36.497 --> 18:39.165
I heard they hired
a new hotshot attorney,

18:39.333 --> 18:41.084
but they never said
how handsome he was.

18:41.201 --> 18:42.881
Look, Rachel,
I'm really swamped right now.

18:42.920 --> 18:46.089
Too swamped to even
stop by and say, "hello"?

18:46.223 --> 18:48.308
Saying hello is just
gonna lead to saying a lot more,

18:48.392 --> 18:51.928
and now is not the time
to have it out.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.847
Well, I'm not here
to have it out with you.

18:54.015 --> 18:56.900
I am here to work with you
on fighting off Sean Cahill.

18:57.018 --> 18:58.151
I don't need any help.

18:58.269 --> 18:59.653
But you just
said you were swamped.

18:59.770 --> 19:01.438
Because I'm trying to avoid
having a conversation with you,

19:01.555 --> 19:04.691
which, obviously, isn't working.

19:04.825 --> 19:06.943
Well, Mike,
I am Harvey's associate now.

19:07.061 --> 19:08.862
So you working a case with him,
you're working it with me.

19:08.946 --> 19:10.426
He didn't say anything
to me about it.

19:10.531 --> 19:12.198
Well, he said it to me.

19:12.333 --> 19:16.119
Why do you think I'm here?

19:16.253 --> 19:18.133
I don't care what he said.
It's not a good idea.

19:18.172 --> 19:20.373
What isn't? For us to even be
in the same room together?

19:20.458 --> 19:21.925
Not right now.
No.

19:22.043 --> 19:24.044
You're the one
who chose to come back here.

19:24.178 --> 19:26.212
So?

19:26.347 --> 19:27.597
So you don't get

19:27.748 --> 19:29.966
to act disappointed
that I work here too.

19:30.084 --> 19:31.301
Rachel. Listen to me.

19:31.418 --> 19:33.119
I told you that I needed space.

19:33.254 --> 19:35.388
What do you call
staying in a hotel?

19:35.523 --> 19:37.891
Based on this conversation,
I call it a smart move.

19:38.025 --> 19:39.976
Okay, Mike, I'm sorry.

19:40.111 --> 19:41.111
Where are you going?

19:41.228 --> 19:42.896
Get some air.

19:48.986 --> 19:50.120
Wow.

19:50.237 --> 19:52.277
They hire you back after helping
them break the law,

19:52.323 --> 19:53.790
and this is
what they give you for lunch?

19:53.908 --> 19:56.268
You wouldn't ask that if you'd
ever had one of these bagels.

19:56.327 --> 19:58.495
Maybe not,
but let me ask you this.

19:58.629 --> 20:02.082
You remember that game show
called Let's Make a Deal?

20:02.216 --> 20:03.383
Not interested.

20:03.501 --> 20:04.834
You haven't heard
what's in it for you.

20:04.969 --> 20:06.586
I don't need to hear
what's in it for me because I

20:06.754 --> 20:08.838
know what's in it for you.

20:08.973 --> 20:10.173
You're a smart kid.

20:10.290 --> 20:11.530
I see why they wanted you back.

20:11.642 --> 20:12.926
I'm gonna get back
to my bagel, which is gonna

20:13.060 --> 20:15.845
taste so much better
when I'm not looking at you.

20:15.980 --> 20:19.933
All right, before you gobble
that up, think about this.

20:20.017 --> 20:22.769
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna get those files,

20:22.853 --> 20:24.771
but there's nothing to stop you
from giving them to me

20:24.905 --> 20:26.439
all on your own.

20:26.574 --> 20:27.941
If you do that,

20:28.109 --> 20:30.276
any of those files
that say "Mike Ross,"

20:30.444 --> 20:34.664
I'll replace with "anonymous
former employee."

20:34.782 --> 20:35.698
That would be tempting, Sean,

20:35.833 --> 20:38.501
if I actually had something
to hide.

20:44.175 --> 20:47.343
Oh, I do have
one more question, though.

20:47.494 --> 20:50.130
Is Harvey footing the bill?
What?

20:50.214 --> 20:52.966
For your room
at the Soho Grand.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.101
That's where you're staying,
right?

20:55.219 --> 20:56.269
You should try the Cobb salad.

20:56.353 --> 20:59.272
It's out of this world.

21:03.811 --> 21:04.727
Guess who just got
propositioned

21:04.862 --> 21:06.362
by a striking blonde?

21:06.480 --> 21:08.648
Please tell me
it was Kate Upton.

21:08.783 --> 21:09.899
Isn't she a little young
for you?

21:10.034 --> 21:11.835
Last night, she told me
I was the perfect age.

21:11.902 --> 21:13.153
To be her father.

21:13.287 --> 21:14.954
When are you gonna understand
they all want a daddy, Mike?

21:15.055 --> 21:16.322
You want to talk about Cahill
or just

21:16.490 --> 21:18.158
keep bragging about things
that never actually happened.

21:18.242 --> 21:20.460
- What did Cahill want?
- It's not what we wanted.

21:20.578 --> 21:21.795
It's what he gave me.

21:21.912 --> 21:22.962
Well, let's have it.

21:23.047 --> 21:24.497
Son of a bitch
knew I was staying at a hotel.

21:24.632 --> 21:25.799
- What are you getting at?
- Didn't you say

21:25.916 --> 21:27.956
he sidestepped Judge Hopkins
to get a search warrant

21:27.968 --> 21:29.002
for our files?

21:29.170 --> 21:30.720
You're thinking
he went around Hopkins

21:30.871 --> 21:32.055
to get authorization
to follow us?

21:32.173 --> 21:34.424
I'm thinking he never
got authorization at all.

21:34.558 --> 21:35.842
Then we need to get a list

21:35.976 --> 21:38.311
of the SEC's requests
for surveillance by tomorrow.

21:38.429 --> 21:39.979
I have a friend at justice.

21:40.097 --> 21:41.681
Since when?

21:41.765 --> 21:43.525
Okay, I don't,
but I thought it sounded cool.

21:43.651 --> 21:45.268
Mike, this is serious.

21:45.402 --> 21:47.203
We need that list,
and we need it by tomorrow.

21:47.321 --> 21:49.189
On it.

21:56.730 --> 21:58.081
Good new, Louis.

21:58.232 --> 22:02.535
I not only misfiled
and misdated that document,

22:02.670 --> 22:05.705
I added in 10,000 others
that look just like it.

22:05.789 --> 22:08.591
That thing is as buried
as it's ever going to be.

22:08.742 --> 22:09.592
What the hell difference
does it make?

22:09.743 --> 22:12.212
It's all for nothing.

22:12.346 --> 22:15.348
- What happened with Forstman?
- What do you think?

22:15.466 --> 22:16.716
He didn't go for it.

22:16.884 --> 22:20.220
No, something else happened
because you wouldn't

22:20.354 --> 22:22.472
be this upset
if he just turned you down.

22:22.606 --> 22:24.557
He wouldn't undo anything,

22:24.642 --> 22:27.694
but he is willing to let me pin
the whole thing on Harvey.

22:27.811 --> 22:29.229
How could you even do that?

22:29.363 --> 22:30.363
Oh, I don't know.

22:30.447 --> 22:32.982
Make up a new document,
forge his signature.

22:33.117 --> 22:34.757
Doesn't matter 'cause
I'm not gonna do it.

22:34.818 --> 22:37.403
- Louis--
- Katrina, enough.

22:37.538 --> 22:39.122
You did good work,

22:39.240 --> 22:41.991
but the truth is, if we
have to turn over those files,

22:42.126 --> 22:43.207
they find that transaction.

22:43.210 --> 22:46.079
I'm gonna end up in prison.

22:48.883 --> 22:52.835
Then you and I better

22:52.970 --> 22:56.389
figure out a way to make sure
Harvey wins that motion.

23:01.628 --> 23:03.513
Okay.

23:06.650 --> 23:07.817
Don't you have a funny way

23:07.935 --> 23:09.819
of giving someone space.
What?

23:09.970 --> 23:12.689
Not only did you do exactly
what we talked about not doing

23:12.823 --> 23:15.608
but you lied, and you
used Harvey's name to do it.

23:15.743 --> 23:17.493
- I am sorry.
- No, sorry's not good enough.

23:17.644 --> 23:20.280
This is the second time we've
had this conversation recently,

23:20.414 --> 23:23.950
and I want to know why the hell
we're having it again.

23:24.034 --> 23:25.501
I didn't mean to lie.

23:25.619 --> 23:27.670
I just--I went to Mike to talk--

23:27.821 --> 23:29.088
That's my point.

23:29.206 --> 23:30.623
You couldn't even make it
through one day?

23:30.758 --> 23:31.841
I thought that I could.

23:31.959 --> 23:34.377
And then, I saw
him sitting there, and I just--

23:34.511 --> 23:36.012
Rachel, just because
something's hard to do

23:36.163 --> 23:37.547
doesn't mean
that you can't do it.

23:37.664 --> 23:39.515
Okay. I shouldn't have
brought Harvey into it,

23:39.633 --> 23:42.018
but I am not going to apologize
for talking to Mike

23:42.136 --> 23:44.304
because he and I aren't the same
as you and Harvey.

23:44.471 --> 23:46.139
Excuse me?

23:46.273 --> 23:48.141
- That didn't come out that I--
- I did not tell you

23:48.309 --> 23:49.976
that for you to just
throw it back in my face.

23:50.060 --> 23:51.711
I didn't mean
to throw it in your face.

23:51.845 --> 23:55.949
I respect that you let things
take their natural course,

23:56.083 --> 23:59.736
but I want to make things work
with Mike,

23:59.870 --> 24:03.873
and the only way I know how
to do that is to fight for him.

24:04.024 --> 24:05.908
Fight for him all you want,

24:06.043 --> 24:07.794
but don't lie about Harvey
ever again.

24:32.353 --> 24:35.521
You missing it in here
already?

24:35.606 --> 24:38.274
Just passing through.

24:38.392 --> 24:40.032
- I lied to you.
- I know you lied to me--

24:40.077 --> 24:42.745
Not that.

24:42.863 --> 24:47.433
Harvey never assigned me
to your case.

24:47.534 --> 24:50.253
I did it
because you left our home,

24:50.404 --> 24:51.921
and you came here.

24:52.072 --> 24:56.876
And all I can think every time
I look at you is how sorry I am.

25:03.717 --> 25:05.397
And the reason
I want you to leave me alone

25:05.469 --> 25:09.972
is all I can think
when I look at you is him.

25:12.426 --> 25:15.228
Then why did you come back?

25:15.396 --> 25:18.898
I was drowning,
and Louis threw me a lifeline.

25:19.033 --> 25:21.067
I'm your lifeline, too.

25:21.235 --> 25:23.369
A lifeline? You're the one
that threw me overboard.

25:23.454 --> 25:26.372
- Mike--
- And why did it have to be him?

25:31.295 --> 25:33.463
I don't need you to keep
telling me that you're sorry

25:33.613 --> 25:36.466
or to be charming
or anything else.

25:39.336 --> 25:43.005
I just need to get that image
out of my head.

26:08.285 --> 26:09.919
- Did you get it?
- No.

26:10.037 --> 26:11.837
A little heads
up would have been nice.

26:11.922 --> 26:13.539
I don't exactly
have a backup plan.

26:13.624 --> 26:15.875
- Well, good thing I do.
- What are you talking about?

26:16.009 --> 26:18.928
It doesn't matter whether we
have proof of our theory or not.

26:19.079 --> 26:21.297
It just matters whether or not
our theory is true.

26:21.431 --> 26:22.431
You typed up a fake list.

26:22.549 --> 26:24.133
Exactly.
Brilliant.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.384
It would have
been a little more brilliant

26:25.519 --> 26:26.936
if you didn't get here
at the last second.

26:27.054 --> 26:29.494
It wouldn't work if it doesn't
look real, and that takes time.

26:29.556 --> 26:30.723
Okay, just give it to me.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.725
I got it.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.231
[Clears throat]

26:38.398 --> 26:39.899
Oh, well, well.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.200
If it isn't the wonder twins.

26:41.318 --> 26:43.202
Form of "douche bag."

26:43.320 --> 26:45.154
Shape of "got you
by the balls."

26:45.289 --> 26:46.572
No, no, no, no.
It's got to be an animal.

26:46.740 --> 26:48.491
I don't care
what it has to be.

26:48.625 --> 26:51.244
What that is,
is every surveillance request

26:51.378 --> 26:53.079
from the SEC
in the last three months.

26:53.247 --> 26:54.580
Mike, why don't you tell him
what's on there?

26:54.715 --> 26:57.416
Oh, he knows what's on there
and what's not on there,

26:57.584 --> 26:59.719
which would be me and you.

26:59.803 --> 27:01.671
Wait a second,
doesn't that make any evidence

27:01.805 --> 27:03.445
he's planning on using today
inadmissible?

27:03.473 --> 27:06.175
I believe it would.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.427
Save yourself
the embarrassment, Sean.

27:08.562 --> 27:10.930
Withdraw your request
for a warrant, a subpoena,

27:11.064 --> 27:12.098
or anything.

27:12.266 --> 27:14.850
All right.
Let's get this thing going.

27:14.985 --> 27:17.153
What are you two doing
at his table?

27:17.304 --> 27:20.906
You want to tell him
or should we?

27:21.024 --> 27:23.743
Your Honor, I am formally
withdrawing my request

27:23.860 --> 27:25.111
to go through their files.

27:25.279 --> 27:26.996
Then, why are we all here?

27:27.147 --> 27:28.781
Because I want it to be
on the record

27:28.949 --> 27:30.700
that Logan Sanders requests

27:30.834 --> 27:32.451
the release
of all communications

27:32.586 --> 27:34.920
between these two gentlemen
on his behalf.

27:35.005 --> 27:36.622
- What?
- You heard me.

27:36.790 --> 27:39.875
Your Honor, how do we know
that signature isn't fabricated?

27:40.010 --> 27:41.010
Go ahead.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.795
Give Mr. Sanders a call.

27:42.929 --> 27:46.465
He'll tell you it's true.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.351
Because unlike you,
he was more than happy

27:48.501 --> 27:53.189
to sign the request
in exchange for immunity.

27:53.340 --> 27:56.275
Pending verification
of this signature,

27:56.410 --> 28:00.313
you are to give him everything
he asks for immediately.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.733
Your Honor.

28:03.867 --> 28:06.369
I told you I'd get those files
sooner or later.

28:06.519 --> 28:09.372
Guess it's gonna be sooner.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.330
What's that?

28:17.464 --> 28:19.665
It's 50 different ways we can
stop Sean Cahill in his tracks.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.334
- Why did you--
- I told you.

28:21.468 --> 28:23.669
An attack on one of us
is an attack on all of us.

28:23.837 --> 28:25.998
Harvey is my brother, and if
Cahill's coming after him,

28:26.089 --> 28:28.224
he is coming after me.
Louis, it doesn't matter.

28:28.342 --> 28:29.703
There's nothing
we can do about it.

28:29.843 --> 28:30.843
What do you mean there's
nothing we can do about it?

28:30.977 --> 28:32.428
Logan Sanders cut a deal
with Cahill.

28:32.562 --> 28:34.480
We have to release
all communications

28:34.564 --> 28:36.982
between me and Harvey on Gillis.

28:37.100 --> 28:38.434
Just between you and Harvey?
That's it?

28:38.568 --> 28:39.485
None of the Forstman stuff?

28:39.603 --> 28:40.820
That's it.

28:40.937 --> 28:42.238
Thank God.
We're in the clear.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.323
Louis, one second ago, you
said that an attack on Harvey

28:44.441 --> 28:45.741
was an attack on you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:45.892 --> 28:46.859
And you just said there's
nothing we can do about it.

28:46.943 --> 28:48.778
But that doesn't make
it a good thing.

28:48.912 --> 28:50.162
- Doesn't it?
- What are you--

28:50.247 --> 28:52.248
Mike, did you
collude with Harvey or not?

28:52.399 --> 28:54.083
- Of course I didn't.
- That's exactly my point,

28:54.234 --> 28:57.086
so as far as I'm concerned,
this matter is done.

29:07.764 --> 29:09.181
Guess what this is?

29:09.299 --> 29:11.183
Louis, I was never really
a Star Trek fan.

29:11.301 --> 29:15.554
It's the resting heart rate
of a happy man.

29:15.689 --> 29:16.922
It's over?

29:17.057 --> 29:18.557
We're sending them files,

29:18.692 --> 29:21.394
but we're not sending
them our files.

29:21.561 --> 29:22.778
I don't understand.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.531

29:25.649 --> 29:27.400
blah, blah, blah.

29:27.567 --> 29:30.369
They're not getting
the Forstman document.

29:30.487 --> 29:32.154
And that's the end?

29:32.289 --> 29:34.740
- That's the end.
- Congratulations, Louis.

Thank you, Katrina.

of the day off and check out

29:42.449 --> 29:43.632

- Yeah, it's his right.
- Goddamn it, Harvey.

30:03.487 --> 30:05.855
You never should have cut
that man loose as a client.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.190
Well, I cut him loose because
I knew he was the kind of person

30:08.325 --> 30:09.575
who would do what he just did.

30:09.693 --> 30:11.277
Bullshit.
You cut him loose

30:11.411 --> 30:13.291
because you knew Mike Ross
was coming back here.

30:13.363 --> 30:14.330
Well, you're damn right I did.

30:14.448 --> 30:15.781
I'm not gonna apologize for it.

30:15.949 --> 30:17.783
You should have
discussed it with me first.

30:17.951 --> 30:21.120
Well, it's easier to ask
for forgiveness than permission.

30:21.254 --> 30:22.788
Forgiveness?

30:22.923 --> 30:24.757

going to apologize for it.

his company brought in.

going back over two decades.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.467

31:18.199 --> 31:20.751

needed to get that image

31:20.869 --> 31:22.419

31:22.537 --> 31:26.340
No.
No, it isn't

get it out of your head.

31:32.347 --> 31:36.467

- Yes, Tess.

31:36.634 --> 31:38.135
And my image isn't made up,

31:38.303 --> 31:43.190
and it wasn't of two people
kissing.

31:43.341 --> 31:45.359
But I got over it
without getting rid of it

31:45.510 --> 31:49.146

doesn't work that way.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.149

more than you hate what I did.

32:12.870 --> 32:17.508

his ass kicked.

one" that was never there

because we have nothing to hide.

33:25.627 --> 33:27.244
No, no.
This is a ploy.

He's trying to get me on record
stating that we have everything,

33:29.964 --> 33:31.498
and if I find nothing,

33:31.616 --> 33:33.917
he's gonna file
malicious prosecution charges.

33:34.052 --> 33:37.170
Actually, Sean, I'm filing
those charges right now.

33:37.288 --> 33:39.923

in the contents

33:40.091 --> 33:42.092
of everything you ever asked
for, this bullshit

33:42.227 --> 33:43.727

to file that action.

I would have said because I had
no place else to go.

why I came back.

35:05.643 --> 35:08.645

Hey, just the person
I was looking for.

to Boston to surprise Sheila,

is the least of our worries.

35:33.838 --> 35:35.372
What do you mean?

35:35.506 --> 35:38.041
Harvey went to court
this morning and agreed to hand

35:38.209 --> 35:41.044
over every single document
on the Gillis takeover,

35:41.179 --> 35:42.429
including Forstman.

35:42.547 --> 35:45.265

Why would--

35:45.416 --> 35:48.435

we have nothing to hide.

35:52.757 --> 35:54.024

out of here in handcuffs.

let it come to that.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.027

are you gonna stop it?

35:57.145 --> 36:01.031

with another.

36:01.149 --> 36:02.899

It's freeing you.
What are you talking about?

36:08.456 --> 36:10.006

like Forstman's payment never

36:10.141 --> 36:12.109
went to any offshore accounts

36:12.210 --> 36:13.690
and that you never took a piece
of it.

36:13.711 --> 36:16.413
No, that's forgery.

36:16.547 --> 36:22.135

than what you did.

36:22.286 --> 36:23.587

36:23.755 --> 36:26.223
Then don't use it,

36:26.324 --> 36:28.508

if we give them those files,

36:28.643 --> 36:30.594
it's only a matter of time.

36:30.728 --> 36:34.431

on Harvey and Mike,

36:34.599 --> 36:36.433
not you and Forstman.

36:36.567 --> 36:38.151
He won't even give this
a second glance.

36:38.302 --> 36:40.103
But if he does,
it puts Harvey in jeopardy,

36:40.238 --> 36:44.991
and I might as well frame him
just like Forstman wanted me to.

36:45.142 --> 36:47.160

to make because they're turning

36:47.278 --> 36:50.163

first thing tomorrow.

Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I don't think it is behind us.

- What?
- I don't know what Louis did,

38:30.097 --> 38:31.548
but I think
he did something wrong.

38:31.682 --> 38:32.883
What are you talking about?

38:33.017 --> 38:35.218
When he came to me yesterday,
he was chomping at the bit

38:35.252 --> 38:36.970

That's Louis.

38:37.104 --> 38:38.984
He'd take a bullet for
this firm, you know that.

38:39.023 --> 38:41.391
Then why did he immediately
change his tune after I told him

38:41.559 --> 38:44.394
that Logan was only
releasing our communications?

38:44.562 --> 38:45.562
He seemed relieved?

38:45.613 --> 38:47.063
He seemed ecstatic,

38:47.231 --> 38:49.533

that I was working on your stuff

it was to fight Cahill.

thinking he might have done?

38:54.539 --> 38:55.789
I don't know exactly,

38:55.940 --> 39:00.627
but I think he cut some sort
of deal with Forstman.

39:00.778 --> 39:01.711
He did cut a deal
with Forstman.

39:01.829 --> 39:03.046

an illegal deal.

you're talking about.

I know, but you weren't there
when he made me that offer.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.837
I'd never seen him like that.

39:10.972 --> 39:14.007
He was desperate to keep me
from working for "that man."

39:14.124 --> 39:15.258
- Mike--
- And then on top of that,

39:15.426 --> 39:17.727

to get me back here.

39:24.569 --> 39:27.270
if he didn't care about
the communications between us?

a dirty deal with Forstman,
