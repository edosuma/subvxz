00:37.120 --> 00:39.122
Ooh, I'm hungry.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.290
Time for breakfast.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.251
Raven, you're gonna have
to keep the beat without me.

00:47.630 --> 00:48.757
Uh-oh.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.800
Ah.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.969
Ahh.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.806

00:58.391 --> 01:00.351

01:07.233 --> 01:10.028
Dang it, Keith.
You call this a smorgasbord?

01:10.111 --> 01:12.030
It's just pans and hot water.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.907
We need to get something straight, Buck.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.785
The free buffet is a courtesy,
not a right.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.287
Oh, don't you get attitudey with me.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.123
We got history. I was dropping 20s here

01:22.207 --> 01:25.001
when all you had
was an old tetherball pole.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.254
Now... get me some fresh egg rolls.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.297
Chop, chop.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.382
Look here, Buck,
don't make me exercise my right

01:31.466 --> 01:32.550
to refuse service.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.678
Why, you ungrateful snotty-faced little...

01:35.762 --> 01:37.222
Oh. Don't say anything you'll regret.

01:37.305 --> 01:41.392
Ahh! I'll rip your pock-marked
little watered-down drink slinger.

01:41.476 --> 01:45.063
Buck... you're no longer welcome
in this establishment.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.660

Kids.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.078


02:00.161 --> 02:01.162
Sir?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.164
What are you doing here in the morning?

02:03.248 --> 02:06.709
I've been kicked out
of Jugstore Cowboys, Hank.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.670
Banned for life.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.380


02:11.840 --> 02:13.216
10:35.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.384
Right about now

02:14.467 --> 02:17.971
Trixie's reloading her bandoleros
with lollipops.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.474
I know those dancers
meant a lot to you, sir,

02:21.558 --> 02:24.435
but there's more to life
than gentlemen's clubs.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.605
Like work.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.942
Everyone would love to have you back
in the saddle here at Strickland.

02:31.025 --> 02:31.985
Work?

02:32.443 --> 02:34.696
Well, I don't really see it, but...

02:34.779 --> 02:36.156
I'll give it a shot.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.785
Do you think those guys

02:40.869 --> 02:42.620
will get mad if I run in

02:42.704 --> 02:45.790
and yell, "Stop the presses!" again?

02:45.874 --> 02:46.958
Tell you what, Bobby,

02:47.041 --> 02:49.377
why don't you go make up a crime report?

02:49.460 --> 02:51.462
If it sounds believable, we'll print it.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.589
Mm.

02:54.799 --> 02:58.553
Oh, I just spent
a glorious day at the spa.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.932
It's like the manicurist was the sheriff
and my cuticles were outlaws.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.351
She really cleaned up the town.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.103
Mm-hmm. I'm on a deadline.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.813
What's another word for "potato"?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.857
Not "tuber," I've already used that twice.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.985
But the best part is...
didn't cost me a dime.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.111
-How's that?
-Ah.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.822
I just flashed my <i>Arlen Bystander</i>
press pass

03:17.906 --> 03:19.741
and open sesame.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.785
This thing we swipe
to get into the parking lot?

03:25.538 --> 03:27.373
Bobby, how's this for a headline?

03:27.665 --> 03:30.960
"Woman Gets Free Stuff
for Having Press Pass."

03:33.630 --> 03:34.756
"Boy Also."

03:36.925 --> 03:40.345
Now before we get started,
I'd like to welcome Mr. Strickland

03:40.428 --> 03:44.182
to our morning roundtable
of new and ongoing projects.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.810
Okay. Now last time Enrique proposed

03:47.894 --> 03:51.689
moving the barbecue mitts
from accessories over to apparel.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.191
Let's kick it around.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.235
Uh, I mean, you wear them, right?

03:55.318 --> 03:58.071
But not as a fashion statement.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.447
Both good points.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.158
I think what Donna doesn't like
is that it's my idea.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.035
-Actually...
-Ah. Aw, jeez.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.036
Hang on, Donna.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.789
Mr. Strickland is trying
to get a word in edgewise.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.632
I, uh, I forgot how high emotions run
at these meetings.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.510
You guys keep going.
There's no time for nominations.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.096
So, Donna... you're interim chair.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.139
Oh, no.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.183
Don't try and stop me.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.354
I'm going to Jugstore Cowboys
and apologizing to Keith.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.899
At least I can look
at some pretty girls while I eat crow.

04:34.983 --> 04:39.070
I left... Oh, I left my keys inside.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.700
Sir, coming back to work
was the right choice.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.077
Don't waiver. Come on. Let's go inside.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.538
No. I hate work, Hank.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.373
It's so God-awful boring.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.834
How you don't kill yourself is beyond me.

04:52.917 --> 04:56.254
Mr. Strickland, I want to show you
how fun work can be.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.464
Please, just give it another chance.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.803
Hey, we could surprise the staff
with ice cream.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.305
That's fun.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.056

05:17.567 --> 05:21.571
Hank. Uh, strawberry
for six adults, please.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.905
We don't have strawberry.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.616
We do have the Strawberry
that Broke the Camel's Back.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.537
Okay. Uh, that sounds pretty close.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.873
And what mix-ins do you want with that?
You get four.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.291
Mix-ins?

05:33.374 --> 05:35.418
Uh, I just want the ice cream.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.087
Sure, Hank. But if you don't want mix-ins,

05:38.171 --> 05:40.673
you're gonna have to wear this
"I like nude ice cream" button.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.008
While you're looking them over,

05:42.091 --> 05:43.801
I'll get you signed up
for our birthday club.

horrible new ice cream place.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.348

This is interesting,
but I have to get dressed.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.084
I'm going to a party at Arlen Ford.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.294
Now that's what I'm talking about, Bill.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.506
Those aren't real parties.
Those are sales.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.134
Sounds like someone didn't get invited.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.600
Buck just called for you, honey.
He's down at the Frozen Cow.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.643
Again?

07:15.726 --> 07:18.187
He's just trading one vice for another.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.691
All I know is, he wants you
to bring him some pants.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.697
Hey, Ol' Top.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.533
Here are your new pants, sir.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.910
I got the "extremely relaxed" fit.

07:32.994 --> 07:33.870
Thanks, Hank.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.456
All my trousers seem
to be wearing out at once.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.125
Uh... I... I brought some paperwork...

07:39.208 --> 07:40.168
Here's the deal.

07:40.251 --> 07:44.338
I can win a gift certificate
by naming the new cherry ice cream.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.633
How do you like, uh, "Cherried Alive"?

07:48.217 --> 07:49.218
Too creepy?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.303
Look at yourself.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.139
Sitting here all day,
changing pants in public.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.224
There's a spoon stuck to your elbow.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.350
Do you even know that?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.186
You don't need this place

07:58.269 --> 08:00.188
or a strip club to be happy.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.189
Yes, I do.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.108
I'm physically addicted to the good times.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.568
I understand that.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.111
Sir, you have my word

08:07.195 --> 08:09.071
that if you come back
to Strickland Propane,

08:09.155 --> 08:13.451
I will do everything in my power
to prove to you that work can be fun.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.578
Fun, huh?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.500
Okay.

08:20.791 --> 08:24.462
Our first order of business
is a special hello to Mr. Strickland

08:24.545 --> 08:26.422
-who is with us...
-I'll take it from here, Hank.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.842
Now, how do we make
Strickland Propane fun?

08:29.926 --> 08:32.553
Do you know? You? You?

08:32.637 --> 08:34.472
Sir, this sounds like new business.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.849
Ordinarily, we start with old business.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.227
Here's the Frozen Cow operations manual,

08:39.310 --> 08:42.146
which I stole from that white kid
with the dreadlocks.

08:42.230 --> 08:47.818
We gonna use this book to turn Strickland
into the happiest propane dealer on earth.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.363
Here's the first number we're gonna learn.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.168
All right.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.170

09:48.254 --> 09:50.631
Look out. Someone's insane.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.968

09:54.885 --> 09:58.472
Ain't this great, Ol' Top?
Good times, laughs...

09:58.556 --> 10:01.892
Yeah, but what about propane?
That's what we're actually selling here.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.270
Uh-uh. That's the old way of thinking.

10:04.353 --> 10:08.566
What we're selling is a fun environment
to buy propane in.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.776
Well, how are we gonna get
all the work done

10:10.860 --> 10:12.737
with everyone cutting up all the time?

10:12.820 --> 10:16.157
Oh, the work will get done all right.
It'll be fun. You promised.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.330
Are you sure
they're gonna let us in for free

10:22.413 --> 10:24.290
just because you work for the paper?

10:24.624 --> 10:25.833
Good point, Bobby.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.128
I will need to make them think
I'm here on official business.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.089
Hello. Peggy Hill, <i>Arlen Bystander.</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:33.924

10:34.008 --> 10:36.636

a down-and-out football team.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.596
Eleven dollars.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.556
Have you ever heard
of freedom of the press?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.141
That means I don't pay.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.311
Okay. Uh, four dollars for the kid.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.814
Pay the man, Bobby.
I'm off to review some popcorn.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.816
What happened to "boy also"?

10:53.027 --> 10:54.403
Sorry, I'm late.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.739
Buck's making us have so much fun all day,

10:56.822 --> 10:59.158
there's no time to get to the actual work.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.119
I thought you wanted Buck
to spend more time at the office.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.331
Well, that was before he got
all his priorities out of whack.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.916
Now, I've got to learn...

11:06.999 --> 11:09.460
juggling to entertain customers.

11:09.543 --> 11:13.130
I can teach you the most essential
fun skill of all, Hank.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.299
"Throwing your voice."

11:15.383 --> 11:17.301
Who said that? "I did."

11:17.385 --> 11:20.054
Well, are you behind that tree over there?

11:20.304 --> 11:22.723
"No, I'm in the garbage can."

11:22.807 --> 11:24.767
Whoever you are, don't bother me

11:24.850 --> 11:27.144
while I sip my beer.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.775
Okay, that last time was me.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.947
And remember.

11:38.030 --> 11:42.618
Propane's not just a gas, it's a gas.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.705
Hank. I can't breathe with this on.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.877
I can't really swallow this thing, honey.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.504
That was just talk.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.131
Just hang in there, guys.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.466
All this nonsense
can't be good for business,

11:57.550 --> 12:00.219
and sooner or later,
Mr. Strickland has to realize it.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.807
Well, at least that means

12:04.890 --> 12:05.933
it's closing time.

12:06.016 --> 12:10.062
Now we can finally get to inventory,
maybe make it home in time for dinner.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.689
What's everybody doing?

12:11.772 --> 12:13.107
I don't hear any laughing.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.568
Well, we're all doing inventory, sir.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.320
And Joe Jack may be
going to the urgent care.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.656
I poked my talk tube.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.907
Inventory?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.117
That's boring.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.577
We can do that kind of stuff later.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.164
Right now we should...
be playing putt-putt golf.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.165
Golf?

12:29.248 --> 12:30.666
Sir, no, we really have...

12:30.750 --> 12:33.836
What we have to do
is build some team spirit.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.755
You said I could count on you, Hank.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.715
Well, I'm counting.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.968
So the putt-putt golf is mandatory?

12:41.051 --> 12:42.970
No. It's fun-datory.

12:43.053 --> 12:46.849
And, hey, after that,
we can have a pizza party.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.142
Pizza?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.814
I'm full.

12:53.898 --> 12:57.443
But I think we better review
the whole dessert cart anyway.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.695
My readers deserve nothing less.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.157
Bobby, I'll be right back.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.368
Incredibly expensive wine
goes right through you.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.793
Press!

13:18.172 --> 13:20.466
And we didn't even
make it back to the office

13:20.549 --> 13:23.594
because the dang pizza place
had a karaoke machine.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.180
You never really notice
that "American Pie"

13:26.263 --> 13:29.016
is seven minutes long
until your boss makes you sing it.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.351
How was their pizza?

13:30.434 --> 13:32.561
Big choice of toppings? Dessert bar?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.689
Sounds like there's a story there for me
around lunchtime.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.983
You're lucky you can enjoy your work.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.778
Tomorrow,
I'm the official Strickland Tickler.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.197
I might have to call in sick.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.873
Hey, I don't look like a bunny.
I look like a goat.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.251
This is about the barbecue mitts,
isn't it?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.419
Look, I know this has been tough,

13:57.503 --> 13:59.922
but Buck's going over receipts right now.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.340
He's still a businessman,

14:01.423 --> 14:03.509
and there hadn't been a customer
in here all day.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.135
Once he sees we're losing money,

14:05.219 --> 14:07.763
he'll pull the plug
on all this gotdang fun.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.891
All right, attention, everyone.

14:10.975 --> 14:15.563
I just been going over our financials,
and the news ain't good.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.731
Ah, <i>gracias,</i><i>madre de Dios.</i>

14:17.815 --> 14:19.316
It's great!

14:19.400 --> 14:20.943
In the first week of business,

14:21.026 --> 14:26.156
the new fun Strickland made $300 more
than the old, boring Strickland.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.616
Business is up?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.326
Yeah, and we're just starting.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.620
From now on, we won't be having fun.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.248
We'll be having super boffo fun.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.500
Sir, we're all kind of exhausted.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.628
Exhausted? Don't worry,
'cause I got something for that.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.631
Besides, we got to do inventory tonight.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.175
And you know what's gonna make that fun?

14:45.801 --> 14:47.970
Check your desk drawers,
and you're gonna find out.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.102
-Pajamas?
-Yeah. Hank was right all along.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.146
Dang if work can't be fun.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.524
We're gonna have us
an all-night slumber party.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.241
I got to bust out of here, Hank.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.744
You don't know this,
but I've been locked up before.

15:11.827 --> 15:12.870
You're not locked up.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.246
You're just kind of being

15:14.330 --> 15:15.873
held hostage.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.250
After the game's over,
we'll get inventory done

15:18.334 --> 15:19.501
and get the heck out of here.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.922
Popcorn's in the microwave.
What word we on?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.173
Pomegranate.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.884
And Joe Jack's narrowed it down
to three definitions.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.302
Pomegranate.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.304
What a cheerleader cheers with.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.681
A fruit with juicy seeds,

15:32.765 --> 15:35.976
or a sack of dirt
you hit yourself on the head with.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.062
Uh, that one, I guess?

15:38.145 --> 15:40.522
Joe Jack, you stink at dictionary.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.485
A pomegranate's a fruit, boy, a fruit.
A delicious fruit.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.363
That's your new nickname, pomegranate.

15:49.156 --> 15:52.368
Can we get to work?
It, it's my husband's birthday

15:52.618 --> 15:54.161
for another ten minutes.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.704
I just want to get home.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.541
Ah, Enrique, you're not
the wet blanket anymore.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.085
She is.

16:05.547 --> 16:09.093
-Hank, I can't take this anymore.
-Just hold on, Enrique.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.594
This can't go on forever.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.305
Oh, God, he's got Risk.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.812
Look alive, Enrique.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.481
Kamchatka's calling Japan out.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.240
Maybe that should be our cue
to call it a night, sir.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.159
I'll just guestimate the number
of meat thermometers.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.286
What's the matter with you, people?

16:36.370 --> 16:40.124
Now, I try to make working
in the crummy propanerie fun, and...

16:40.207 --> 16:43.335
Well, plainly, I need
to soak a bunch of more wet blankets.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.296
I won't wear the blanket again, honey.
I swear I won't.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.383
I hate it, too, but you can't argue
with Mr. Strickland.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.760
Not when business is up.
I mean, look at this.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.472
We were up 40 bucks on Monday,
80 on Tuesday,

16:55.723 --> 16:58.142
60 Wednesday... Huh.

16:58.225 --> 17:01.186
It's always exact increments of $20.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.063
Wait a second.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.025
Donna, does Buck know
the combination to the cash box?

17:06.108 --> 17:08.694
Sure. Every time we go
to Jugstore Cowboys,

17:08.777 --> 17:10.654
he'd help himself to some 20s.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.614
That's why business is up.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.242
It's just because
Buck isn't raiding the register

17:15.325 --> 17:17.077
and blowing the money at the strip bar.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.246
There's no reason to do any of this junk.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.581
When he comes back,

17:20.664 --> 17:24.418
I say we throw a blanket over his head
and do what feels right.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.212
Sure, that might make us all
feel better in the short term,

17:27.296 --> 17:30.966
but the moment he regains consciousness,
we're right back where we started.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.052
Enrique, make sure Joe Jack

17:33.135 --> 17:35.596
doesn't kill Mr. Strickland
while I'm gone.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.312
You got to let Buck come back, Keith.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.688
He's your best customer.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.274
Well, the girls are kind of thrown off.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.193
They're so used to Buck
being in his usual seat,

17:49.276 --> 17:51.528
half the time, they end up plopping down
on an empty chair.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.030
And if I'm not mistaken,

17:53.113 --> 17:56.075
your revenues are down
by at least $300 a week.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.035
Okay, if he crawled here

17:58.118 --> 18:00.037
on his hands and knees
and begged forgiveness,

18:00.120 --> 18:02.039
I might consider taking him back.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.874
Well, he won't do that now.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.960
Buck wanted to come here
to apologize the very next day

18:07.044 --> 18:09.171
after his banishment,
but I talked him out of it.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.216
I'm the one you should ban
from Jugstore's, not Buck.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.759
Then you're banished, too.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.511
But that doesn't change anything
with Buck.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.262
Look, you guys need each other.

18:17.971 --> 18:21.266
Well, it would sure be nice
to hear Buck say that.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.268
Huh.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.396
Truth or dare, Enrique.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.689
Ever kill anyone?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.149
-No.
-Darn!

18:29.233 --> 18:30.692
I thought you were gonna take a dare.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.821
I was gonna blindfold you
and make you sniff the mystery foot.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.867
Strickland Propane, it's a gas, gas, gas.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.286
Sir, I'm over here
at the Frozen Cow Creamery,

18:41.370 --> 18:44.790
and they've got a new fun activity
I think you might want to steal.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.251
Oh. I'm goin' right now.
Gonna run over there.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.503
Make a run for it.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.843
Is it a contest?

18:55.926 --> 18:57.344
Is it a new flavor?

18:57.427 --> 18:59.138
We'll get to that.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.057
Hey, Troy, how about a mother lode
of Berry Interesting?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.016
I'm on it.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.269
9:15.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.895
Isn't that when Trixie goes on?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.856
Uh, usually.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.691
I mean, sometimes Raven takes that shift.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.818
I don't know. Sometimes,
they, they both, uh...

19:12.901 --> 19:14.528
<i>♪ Eat, eat, eat ice cream ♪</i>

19:14.611 --> 19:16.113
<i>♪ Here at Frozen Cow ♪</i>

19:16.196 --> 19:18.282
<i>♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪</i>

19:18.365 --> 19:19.867
<i>♪ Eat your ice cream now ♪</i>

19:19.950 --> 19:21.618
You smell that, Hank?

19:21.702 --> 19:24.746
Smell like them Swedish meatballs
they serve at Jugstore's.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.126
Y-You don't have a new
Swedish meatball flavor, do ya, boy?

19:29.209 --> 19:32.337
Course not, course not.
I must be sleep-deprived or something.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.589
Maybe.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.010
Hey, could you break this 20
into, uh, singles?

19:38.093 --> 19:39.052
Huh?

19:39.136 --> 19:40.554
For a tip?

19:41.722 --> 19:43.724
Shouldn't we be getting back
to the office?

19:43.807 --> 19:46.185
Sir, I've got 20 singles for you.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.770
Now, do you want to put 'em back
in the register at work,

19:48.854 --> 19:52.900
or put 'em in the tip jar here
so you can hear Troy sing some more,

19:52.983 --> 19:55.944
or put 'em to use over
at Jugstore Cowboys?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.238
Joe Jack was working on

19:58.322 --> 19:59.656
some tongue twisters

19:59.740 --> 20:02.451
that were pretty nifty, and, and I...

20:02.534 --> 20:06.330
Gotdang, I'm smelling meatballs.
I want to go to my strip club.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.497
Then, do it, sir.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.582
I can't.

20:08.665 --> 20:13.212
Fact is, I was a shade guilty of gluttony
vis-a-vis Keith's buffet,

20:13.295 --> 20:16.340
but I can't apologize to him.
I just can't.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.591
You just did, Buck.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.092
And I accept.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.430
I didn't apologize, you ol' humpback toad.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.224
Ah, I got you.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.684
Well, this isn't an apology, either,

20:27.935 --> 20:31.605
but, uh, I do like to defrost
a tray of hors d'oeuvres

20:31.688 --> 20:33.148
for my best customers.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.152
Well, why don't you two gentlemen
continue this discussion

20:37.236 --> 20:40.906
of who's not apologizing
in a more adult atmosphere?

20:41.114 --> 20:43.659
I believe I know just the place,

20:43.742 --> 20:46.954
but I might be the latest smidge
getting back to the office.

20:47.037 --> 20:50.457
Hank, can I count on you
to keep things on track at Strickland?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.042
You know, with the fun and such?

20:52.125 --> 20:53.377
I guarantee it.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.130
There's your pomegranate, honey.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.304
You're right, Hank. This bonfire is fun.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.516
Yup, and you know
what's gonna be even more fun?

21:07.891 --> 21:09.184
Getting back to work.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.269
-<i>He wants you</i>
<i>to bring him some pants.</i>
