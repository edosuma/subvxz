WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:14.681
She just lay there… right on the ground.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.768
Fight just… drained from her.

00:20.395 --> 00:25.233
Twitching and drooling like some kind of
animal that got hit by a car or something.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.780
The whole thing
went down right in front of me.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.326
Ringside seats, huh?

00:36.953 --> 00:38.163
Saw the whole thing.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.457
Can anyone verify that?

00:52.594 --> 00:55.221
You can check
the kiss cam thing if you want.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.727
-Sure you don't want a lawyer here?
-No.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.522
-You don't find it coincidental?
-What's that?

01:05.190 --> 01:08.610
That both the bullets in Lucy's head
match the ones in the other bodies?

01:08.693 --> 01:09.944
I don't know any Lucy.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.281
And that the other bodies
were identified as 6 Mile gang members.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.575
-I got no beef with them.
-Yeah, not anymore.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.494
One more thing.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.457
How'd you get these?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.168
Called in a favor.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.255
Might want to call in a few more.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.009
Yeah.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.970
[Rio clears throat]

01:41.100 --> 01:42.352
[door closes]

01:45.188 --> 01:47.816
Now that's what
you call a statement piece.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.693
And I think we all know what it says.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.158
What does it say?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.577
He wants more than dinner.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.787
Ew.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.580
It's the thought that counts.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.666
-Ew!
-What did you say?

02:05.333 --> 02:07.043
I said I'd check my schedule.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.336
That's not a no.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.421
We need him to do this job.

02:10.505 --> 02:14.676
Or maybe we get lucky and they figure out
that it was gang friend who popped Lucy.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.554
If we pop him, all of this goes away.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.102
Maybe it's just dinner.

02:25.103 --> 02:25.937
Sure.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.897
If they're serving vagina.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.858
[Dean] What's for dinner?

02:31.151 --> 02:34.028
-Uh… I thought we'd grill.
-[Dean] Sounds good.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.864
Hey, can I talk to you real quick?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.292
Big Kahuna, they want to meet with us.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.459
That's a good thing?

02:48.543 --> 02:53.548
[scoffs] Yeah, Kahuna brand spas.
They pretty much invented hydrotherapy.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.842
I mean, they're in all the fancy resorts.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.844
So why us?

02:57.927 --> 03:00.430
They heard our sales
were through the roof.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.809
Well, that's all you.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.686
No, I wouldn't be able to sell them

03:06.769 --> 03:09.272
if you didn't get them
so cheap from the wholesalers.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.649
-[pen scribbling]
-Or you're an animal.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.692
[Dean chuckles]

03:13.484 --> 03:14.819
We make a good team.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.529
[Dean chuckles]

03:19.908 --> 03:21.576
[Stan] <i>They make you pay for books?</i>

03:21.659 --> 03:24.287
Like going to Outback
and bringing your own steak.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.331
They say I need a laptop, too.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.874
No fair.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.626
-And an iPad.
-What?

03:29.709 --> 03:31.252
If he gets one, I get one.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.420
[doorbell dinging]

03:32.503 --> 03:36.257
What does this school do to provide for
the money we've been dishing out?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.718
-Oh, you mean the money we don't have?
-Yeah, that money.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.220
-The building.
-[Stan] Great.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.515
So what does a little boy
need an iPad for anyway?

03:44.599 --> 03:45.767
Coding.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.896
[Stan] Uh, company.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.774
[gasps] Hey!

03:52.857 --> 03:54.359
-There she is.
-Oh, my goodness!

03:54.442 --> 03:55.777
-Excuse me.
-Nice to see you!

03:55.860 --> 03:57.320
[Mrs. Haskins] Look at you!

03:58.321 --> 03:59.822
-What a surprise.
-[Carl] Yeah.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.325
[sighs] Should have called first.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.911
Well, we tried, but, uh,
we ran out of minutes.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.454
[chuckles] Could have texted.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.166
Yeah, we've got to
get that feature on the next one.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.505
So, uh… what brings you guys to town?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.216
We got home from our last visit

04:18.299 --> 04:20.385
and found a note from the landlord.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.469
Very sweet man.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.305
Yeah, gave us a whole week
to clear out our belongings.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.849
-[Mrs. Haskins] He didn't need to do that.
-[Carl] Yeah.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.518
But what is that saying?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.854
Every sunset is an opportunity to reset.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.064
Love that.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.358
[Carl clears throat]

04:36.025 --> 04:39.362
We're staying with our friend's daughter
who works at the Denny's.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.030
Mmm. Yeah, uh, set up a couple cots

04:41.114 --> 04:43.741
in the garage, a little,
uh… kerosene heater.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.577
We are snug as a bug in a rug.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.539
[hesitates] But… why Detroit?

04:52.208 --> 04:53.042
Uh…

04:54.002 --> 04:57.005
We don't have any family
to speak of in Madison.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.424
Oh, so who do you have here?

05:02.051 --> 05:03.428
You all. [sighs]

05:06.097 --> 05:07.390
[Carl chuckles nervously]

05:08.016 --> 05:10.018
Home is where the heart is.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.902
-What's new with you, little guy?
-I'm getting an iPad.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.280
So what about dinner?
How about some dinner?

05:22.363 --> 05:26.117
-Oh, we couldn't possibly.
-No, we already ate, uh, yesterday.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.830
-I got your favorite mashed potatoes.
-Well, if you're going to twist my arm…

05:30.913 --> 05:32.373
-[Carl laughs]
-[Mrs. Haskins] Oh!

05:32.457 --> 05:33.666
-[Carl] Sure.
-Yeah.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.044
[Mrs. Haskins] May I sit
right here next to you?

05:36.127 --> 05:37.837
[Carl] Looks just as delicious as always.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.092
[door opening]

05:44.302 --> 05:45.720
-Hey.
-Hi.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.474
-School still suck?
-Always.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.560
Maybe I'll, um, come see for myself.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.728
Huh?

05:56.397 --> 05:58.524
What happens at these things anyway?

05:58.608 --> 06:02.111
Stupid rich parents bid on
stupid rich stuff for the school.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.489
Can't wait.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.157
[Ben] You're not rich.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.950
But I'm stupid.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.578
-So come.
-Sweet.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.874
You'll hate it, though.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.960
Well, I want to meet the other parents.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.214
You'll hate them even more.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.801
[chuckles] Well, how's the food?

06:24.884 --> 06:28.429
Super tiny, 'cause none of the moms eat.
You'll house a pizza after.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.306
Really selling it hard here.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.811
It's just a bunch of people
we totally make fun of.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.272
Like, who would do Pilates
and would have played lacrosse.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.818
What's so wrong with lacrosse?

06:42.944 --> 06:45.071
Nothing… if you're lame.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.240
Are we out of salsa?

06:52.203 --> 06:53.329
[Annie sighs]

06:54.622 --> 06:55.623
Maybe, uh…

06:56.666 --> 06:58.209
Maybe I'll skip it, then.

06:59.836 --> 07:00.753
Up to you.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.053
[grunts]

07:10.138 --> 07:11.013
[sighs]

07:11.097 --> 07:12.890
Why are you even doing this?

07:12.974 --> 07:15.435
I can't arrest someone on a hunch.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.604
-It's her.
-Why? 'Cause she's good at crafting?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.399
Or 'cause she'd never
be friends with you in high school?

07:22.191 --> 07:24.318
She works at a paper store.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.195
His name is all over it.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.197
I think the boots are a little too much.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.870
-You want it to be her?
-Yes.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.998
Then get me something to convince a DA.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.917
[scoffs]

07:42.378 --> 07:43.880
Save the boots for later.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.595
[clears throat]

07:50.678 --> 07:55.308
You'll notice that we are
all about the flow here at Boland Bubbles.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.517
Feng shui.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.769
Yeah, uh, the accessories, your filters,

07:58.853 --> 08:00.938
chemicals, pool toys, all in the back.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.565
Like the milk in the grocery store.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.109
Have to move through
the place to get to the small stuff,

08:05.193 --> 08:07.153
so when it's time
to upgrade to the big stuff…

08:07.236 --> 08:09.405
Say… a Kahuna spa.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.324
The seed is already planted.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.868
[pop song playing]

08:13.951 --> 08:14.827
[Dave] Well…

08:15.411 --> 08:18.331
Kahuna Spas
would love to be part of the ride.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.251
You all do this for everybody?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.253
I gotta tell you…

08:24.337 --> 08:27.840
Uh, we have been so nervous.
We're just huge fans of your brand.

08:27.924 --> 08:31.552
Well, let's take a look at those books,
see if we can't work out an arrangement.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.555
Books?

08:34.639 --> 08:37.975
Well, we don't really have a presence
here in Michigan. You'd be the first.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.062
We just want to make sure you can
handle the kind of volume we'd expect.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.689
We can get you the books.
No problem, right?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.359
Yeah. Not here right now.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.487
-We can get them.
-Yeah, it'll take a sec.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.406
But then they're all yours.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.244
You do shots?

08:57.245 --> 08:58.204
Like, right now?

08:58.287 --> 09:01.916
You seem like someone
who knows how to have a good time.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.669
[chuckles] Tell your liver
I apologize in advance.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.045
[Dave laughing]

09:15.388 --> 09:16.222
Hmm.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.186
Is that a good "hmm" or a bad "hmm"?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.689
-Good "hmm."
-Oh.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.648
Good.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.276
-Too good.
-What do you mean, "too good"?

09:29.193 --> 09:30.945
You bitches got too much cash flow.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.905
How is that not a good thing?

09:32.989 --> 09:37.034
Accounts don't match up with your sales,
profits are more than your revenue.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.954
So I'll make it look
like we're selling more.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.372
That's impossible.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.665
Why?

09:42.748 --> 09:45.626
'Cause it already says you're selling
five times the national average.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.461
[whistles] Go, Deansie.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.088
[Beth and Ruby] It's not Deansie.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.633
So how do I make it look more legit?

09:53.509 --> 09:54.969
Came to the right place.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.555
Let you in on some of my,
uh, mad money magic,

09:57.638 --> 09:59.974
kind of like a black magic, if you will.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.892
-Like a dark art.
-All right.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.813
All right, uh… Kick things off
with something called smurfing.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.232
While this Kahuna
is checking out your business,

10:08.316 --> 10:11.277
-put your bread in someone else's account.
-Like whose?

10:11.360 --> 10:14.822
Friends, family, colleagues.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.033
Anyone who wants to make a buck.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.786
And before you get any ideas,
I am none of the above.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.331
We're the only other
sketchy people we know.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.458
No sweat. Then there's layering.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.002
Open up a bunch of offshore accounts,
but mini ones.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.630
Only put in enough
so you don't trigger the taxman.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.758
-Then there's smurf layering--
-We don't have time for any of this.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.722
You girls like to shop?

10:41.557 --> 10:44.060
[JT] <i>You're gonna get yourselves</i>
<i>a corporate debit card.</i>

10:46.020 --> 10:48.397
<i>We'll balance your books</i>
<i>by increasing your expenses.</i>

10:48.481 --> 10:51.150
-And how many rooms are we doing?
-All of them.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.652
[JT] <i>Furniture, electronics.</i>

10:52.735 --> 10:56.030
-What can I set you up with today?
-I'll be setting you up, Todd.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.908
[JT] <i>Charitable donations.</i>
<i>Buy right, they won't look twice.</i>

10:58.991 --> 11:00.326
What kind of event is it?

11:00.409 --> 11:01.702
Like Cinderella.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.580
Only the bitch sisters
are private school parents,

11:04.664 --> 11:06.749
and the ball is a fundraiser.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.505
[Stan] Hey, look who dropped by.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.631
-[quietly] Again.
-Hey.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.383
Oh.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.426
Do some damage at the Apple store?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.011
Yeah…

11:19.095 --> 11:20.930
It's just some school supplies.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.974
Where does he go to school?
NASA? [laughing]

11:24.058 --> 11:25.351
[both chuckle weakly]

11:25.434 --> 11:26.811
[clears throat] Oh.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.482
Doesn't do email, but, uh…

11:32.483 --> 11:35.069
Jenny and I wanted to
give you all something.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.195
[Stan] Oh.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.196
A pocket plum.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.282
Oh. Did you ever hear
the one about the fig tree?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.743
It was Heather's favorite.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.080
Well, I guess we got to
get up on our fig tree stories. [laughs]

11:46.163 --> 11:48.207
Farmer had a tree, full of figs.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.627
Till everyone walking by helps themselves,

11:52.378 --> 11:55.256
thinking, "What could it hurt?
It's just one."

11:55.339 --> 11:57.133
Where are you all from, again?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.718
You see where this is going. Okay.

11:59.802 --> 12:03.347
[clears throat] Pretty soon,
tree is plucked dry.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.933
Now nobody has figs.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.144
The farmer can't believe it

12:08.227 --> 12:13.023
'cause all they had to do was
take their fig, plant the seeds,

12:13.107 --> 12:14.775
and they have their own tree.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.776
But instead…

12:16.986 --> 12:18.112
they just took…

12:18.195 --> 12:19.613
[suspenseful music playing]

12:19.697 --> 12:22.575
and they took, and they took…

12:24.368 --> 12:25.202
and they took.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.705
-We're supposed to plant a fig now?
-What did you buy?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.373
This is Detroit. Not Mesopotamia.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.875
Coming up in here like Steve Jobs.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.543
You could've given me a heads-up.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.962
Pull out my
next-gen iPhone in front of him?

12:35.045 --> 12:37.965
And then you invite him to dinner… again!

12:38.549 --> 12:39.467
He asked.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.803
You know what that means?

12:46.932 --> 12:47.975
We're the tree.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.943
They're going to shake us dry.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.243
What's their last name, again?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.996
Haskins. Why?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.416
Going to put Mike on these fools,
get a background check.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.461
Yeah, man.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.670
No, it's all good.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.672
Listen, got something quick for you.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.091
Uh… Yeah, she's here.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.260
Okay, bye.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.180
[sighs] He wants me to FaceTime him.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.348
He just got some plugs.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.849
He wants you to take a look.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.101
-[line ringing]
-Are you serious?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.563
Yes. Just say they look good.
We need him to do this quick.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.160
[Kevin] Public street, bro.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.663
[sighs] It's me.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.210
What's up, girl?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.046
[pop song playing on speakers]

14:04.134 --> 14:05.261
Can I get you a drink?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.513
Uh, got a beer?

14:08.264 --> 14:11.600
[hesitates] Not while the keys
are in the ignition.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.352
Okay.

14:13.894 --> 14:14.812
Red Bull?

14:15.771 --> 14:16.772
I'm okay.

14:18.440 --> 14:23.070
[clicks tongue] So listen, uh,
there's this thing at my kid's school,

14:23.153 --> 14:26.949
and basically, I don't want to show up
and look like some pathetic old

14:27.032 --> 14:29.994
divorced single parent
with no life, so I--

14:30.077 --> 14:31.412
You want me to be your date?

14:33.998 --> 14:36.083
I was thinking more like a wingman.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.297
Already asked the guy you're into?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.090
No.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.427
Cool.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.597
He got engaged.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.182
[song continues playing]

14:59.440 --> 15:00.733
[song stops]

15:09.742 --> 15:12.870
Yeah, you know, I would, but…

15:14.705 --> 15:15.956
I'm busy.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.752
Excuse me? Doing what?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.380
I got the guy across the street's Hulu.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.966
Going to binge
the new season of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

15:26.550 --> 15:29.803
-Are you being serious?
-Uh, yeah. Hannah B is back.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.139
He picks Hannah Ann, okay?

15:33.057 --> 15:36.352
-I am asking you for a favor here.
-See, that's the problem.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.648
I don't want to be your favor anymore.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.400
Oh.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.158
[paper rustling]

16:04.546 --> 16:06.090
Will you accept this rose?

16:07.132 --> 16:07.967
Always.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.683
You know, I was going to
use this for toilet paper.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.477
You're going to need
to wear something clean.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.020
That's not a problem.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.814
Uh…

16:23.899 --> 16:26.694
Mmm… I think… Yeah, there's
a nice shirt under you.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.196
What do you think?

16:31.448 --> 16:33.993
[Dean] Very Tommy Bahama.

16:34.076 --> 16:38.122
I thought eventually we would do an
island lounge kind of thing at the store,

16:38.205 --> 16:39.873
so we could feel it out first.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.166
Hmm.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.626
How did you pay for it?

16:42.710 --> 16:43.919
It's a tax write-off.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.546
[scoffs] Yeah, but how?

16:48.048 --> 16:49.466
What do you mean, "How?"

16:49.550 --> 16:50.592
Well, it's just…

16:51.468 --> 16:53.554
I mean, it's a lot of stuff.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.807
But if we use it for the business,
we get a break on our taxes.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.518
-I know how a write-off works.
-Okay.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.026
How are those books coming?
Kahuna, he keeps asking.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.236
Yeah, there's a lot to account for.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.700
This is going to look like
we're trying to hide stuff, you know?

17:17.911 --> 17:19.079
Are we?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.248
Of course not.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.877
You know, I could…

17:25.544 --> 17:26.670
I could help you.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.089
I just have a whole system.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.259
-[Dean] You could teach me.
-I know, but it's complicated.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.887
I have been doing this
a little longer than you.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.514
How could I forget?
We almost lost our home.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.563
I just want to get 'em right.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.442
Yeah, okay.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.695
You want to see
the hammocks in the boys' room?

17:52.696 --> 17:53.530
Sure.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.563
What are you doing?

18:26.647 --> 18:27.689
Just thinking.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.983
Do you have to do it here?

18:30.609 --> 18:32.569
-You'd rather I do it inside?
-No.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.323
How's Dean?

18:36.865 --> 18:38.075
What do you want?

18:38.909 --> 18:40.786
I need you to hold something for me.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.789
-No, thank you.
-Yeah, I wasn't asking.

18:43.872 --> 18:47.292
Well, the last time I did that,
I got tied to a murder, so…

18:47.835 --> 18:49.670
What's your routing number?

18:49.753 --> 18:51.505
-For what?
-For business.

18:51.588 --> 18:52.714
Why?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.634
[sighs] I need to move some funds around.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.136
Now?

18:58.262 --> 19:01.140
Still drawing some heat
over that little coworker of yours.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.642
Are you smurfing me?

19:03.725 --> 19:07.020
-[chuckles] Where did you hear that?
-Oh, I know all about it.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.063
[laughs]

19:08.147 --> 19:12.234
And I'd love to help you smurf me,
but I can't afford to be smurfed right now

19:12.317 --> 19:14.361
because I am also "drawing some heat."

19:14.444 --> 19:16.989
-Oh, yeah? From who?
-From this hot tub guy.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.032
[laughing]

19:19.116 --> 19:20.075
Routing number.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.286
-No.
-Number.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.453
Not a chance.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.141
Ready whenever you are.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.707
How's Thursday for dinner?

20:11.835 --> 20:13.545
[female auctioneer] All right, parents!

20:13.629 --> 20:18.050
Next we have a top-of-the-line
robot vacuum that retails for $875.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.010
How did you two meet, again?

20:20.093 --> 20:21.220
Mmm…

20:21.303 --> 20:23.805
-We were both on the freeway, right?
-By the freeway.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.891
-We ran into each other.
-At Synagogue.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.977
-Uh… Wait, no. Weren't we on this side--
-No.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.270
Wait, you're Jewish?

20:30.354 --> 20:32.356
-No, she's not.
-Yes.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.815
I am.

20:34.983 --> 20:35.817
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:39.029
[female auctioneer]
…two hundred in the back! Do I hear $250?

20:39.112 --> 20:41.365
Think about that new tennis court, people.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.116
-[woman] Right here!
-Two-fifty.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.035
-Oh! Mmm.
-[female auctioneer] Do I hear $300?

20:45.118 --> 20:46.286
-Three hundred, anyone?
-Mmm.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.164
[female auctioneer] You can
control this item from your smartphone!

20:49.748 --> 20:52.459
You can go back as many times as you want.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.878
I'm going to
cruise through on the way out.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.380
Stock up on some shrimps.

20:59.967 --> 21:00.801
[man] Excuse me?

21:01.468 --> 21:03.178
Are you a dog walker?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.846
I used to be.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.056
Could be again.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.766
What kind of hound you got?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.227
You tell me.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.104
-Sorry?
-[man] Honey!

21:12.187 --> 21:14.314
I found the guy who stole Oatmeal.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.317
Oh, yeah. The, uh, Chihuahua.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.527
"Stole"?

21:18.610 --> 21:19.528
Misplaced.

21:22.739 --> 21:23.991
Who is this loser?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.952
Okay. Come on, man.
Let's just take a walk.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.287
Your dick dog bit me.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.163
Hey, do not call his dog a dick.

21:31.039 --> 21:34.668
Well, maybe I let him go so he wouldn't
have to live with a dick like you.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.169
That's better.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.714
[female auctioneer] Four hundred?
Do I hear $400?

21:39.548 --> 21:44.594
I've got $400 from St. Anne's
very own Sister Mary Margaret.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.014
-Do I hear--
-$1,000.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.807
[people murmuring]

21:48.890 --> 21:50.100
We're only on four--

21:50.183 --> 21:53.395
One… thousand… dollars.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.813
[applause]

21:55.397 --> 21:59.192
[exclaims graciously] $1,000 to…

22:00.152 --> 22:02.487
-Ben's mom.
-Ben's mom.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.781
[applause]

22:07.826 --> 22:08.952
[indistinct chatter]

22:09.036 --> 22:10.662
[pop music playing on speakers]

22:10.746 --> 22:12.205
-And we're okay.
-Oh!

22:12.289 --> 22:13.915
-[grunts]
-Oh, my gosh.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.669
[coughing] You do not mess around.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.504
Work hard. Play harder.

22:19.588 --> 22:23.008
So is your wife
cool with you being gone so much?

22:25.218 --> 22:26.345
What about you?

22:26.887 --> 22:31.058
Must be hard having
to answer to your lady all day.

22:31.141 --> 22:34.186
[chuckles] I don't answer to my lady.
She just kind of helps out.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.229
It seems like she does more than that.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.439
Yeah, I mean…

22:38.231 --> 22:39.608
She makes me look good.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.319
Customers like to know
it's a family-owned business,

22:42.402 --> 22:44.488
but I call all the shots.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.573
Shots, speaking of.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.158
Oh, yeah, let's fire that up.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.744
I knew you wore the pants, man.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.247
-Yeah. I mean, I make all the decisions.
-Nice.

22:54.331 --> 22:58.668
Which is why you can trust that
Big Kahuna brand is in the right hands.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.545
Thank you.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.966
So how come
it's taking so long to get those books?

23:09.429 --> 23:13.558
[female auctioneer] Do I hear $750
for a prime St. Anne's parking spot?

23:13.642 --> 23:16.561
Never circle
the neighborhood again at pickup.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.771
Seven-fifty.

23:18.855 --> 23:21.942
Do I hear $775? $775?

23:22.025 --> 23:23.693
One thousand dollars.

23:23.777 --> 23:26.029
[people murmuring]

23:26.113 --> 23:29.783
Sold to Ben's mom, $1,000.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.787
Hey, what are you doing?

23:35.455 --> 23:37.124
Supporting St. Anne's.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.876
You're not winning this stuff, Annie.
You have to pay for it.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.670
-Really? Gee, thanks.
-Yeah.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.089
-With money.
-Ooh.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.008
-"Portable projector"?
-There's no layaway plan.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.594
-Got it. [mouthing] $1,000.
-And I'm not covering it.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.222
[female auctioneer]
It looks like we have another $1,000…

23:52.305 --> 23:53.265
What is your problem?

23:55.433 --> 23:57.269
-Is it the homeless guy?
-What?

23:57.352 --> 23:59.271
He making you sell drugs or something?

23:59.354 --> 24:02.691
No, he's not like that.
He's… he's actually really…

24:09.656 --> 24:11.074
He stole a dog, Annie.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.534
Misplaced.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.871
Well, you're throwing around money
like a Saudi prince so something's up.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.373
I'm just trying to have fun
like every other parent here.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.167
[female auctioneer] Six days, five nights,

24:20.250 --> 24:22.961
all-expenses paid
at Bermuda's Horseshoe Bay…

24:23.044 --> 24:24.963
You'd tell me
if you were in trouble, right?

24:25.046 --> 24:27.424
How are my finances any of your business?

24:27.507 --> 24:29.718
Because you have no finances.

24:29.801 --> 24:33.722
-I have $6,000. Do I hear $6,500?
-$6,500.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.474
$6,500. Do I hear $7,000?

24:38.977 --> 24:40.478
Ten thousand dollars.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.398
Wow. [chuckles]

24:44.232 --> 24:46.109
Ben's mom, uh… again.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.627
What?

25:03.710 --> 25:05.545
Daddy's dead.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.970
[Dean groans]

-Boland charm.

-Don't worry. He said they look great.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.988
I need you to get something back for me.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.365
Nah, I'm not interested.

28:36.840 --> 28:42.178
you are going on a six-day,
five-night trip to beautiful Bermuda!

28:50.854 --> 28:52.772
Do you even know where this is?

28:52.856 --> 28:54.399
Somewhere sunny.

28:54.482 --> 28:58.403
We could rent a cabana.
We could charter a boat, swim with sharks.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.533
Okay. Or we could just, you know,

29:03.616 --> 29:06.077
grab a pic for the Gram
and jump back on the boat.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.455
How'd you pay for all of this?

29:08.538 --> 29:10.665
How are you not more excited?

29:10.749 --> 29:14.002
I'd be excited about a car
that doesn't have a hole in the floor.

29:14.085 --> 29:14.961
Right.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.213
A microwave that doesn't set food on fire.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.339
Well, sure, yeah, but--

29:18.423 --> 29:20.717
Oh! I know. A house.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.762
Hey, I did all of this for you.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.431
-Yeah, right.
-What is that supposed to mean?

29:26.514 --> 29:29.434
-You did it to show off!
-That's not true.

29:29.517 --> 29:32.353
-Stop trying to be them.
-Okay.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.939
Sorry, Mr. Lacrosse Midfielder.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.818
I didn't want to tell you.

29:38.902 --> 29:42.071
You didn't want your fancy new friends
to know about your broke-ass mom?

29:42.155 --> 29:44.491
No, because when
I mentioned joining the team once

29:44.574 --> 29:47.452
you called them
douchebags and date-rapers.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.454
I meant college lacrosse.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.790
And what? Have friends over

29:53.583 --> 29:57.587

-By going to a therapist you want to bone.

-That's not fair.
-It's true.

life's a bigger joke than yours.

-Dad's.

30:22.946 --> 30:23.947
No, thank you.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.407
Why not?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.243
Because I don't like them.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.620
-Why not?
-I don't know.

30:32.455 --> 30:33.748
Uh… They're too bitter.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.637
Now try.

30:55.061 --> 30:57.188
Mmm, mmm.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.107
Salt pulls out the essence.

30:59.774 --> 31:03.486
Pink Himalayan's best.
Has a subtle mineral flavor.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.781
And the butter, always European.
It's higher fat.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.284
So it's richer,
creamier, cuts the bitterness.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.123
Without all the elements
working together, it's just a radish.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.167
But when it's prepared thoughtfully…

31:19.127 --> 31:20.044
a symphony.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.173
I just need the job done.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.137

31:29.888 --> 31:31.806
He's making my life hell.

with braised onion. Enjoy.

My son plays Bantam hockey.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.912
Mine does travel.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.122
He used to get in fights on the ice.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.250
If he started it, I would punish him.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.878
I would take away
his video games, whatever.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.006
After I got into my current line of work,

32:05.673 --> 32:07.050
I just stopped.

32:08.509 --> 32:12.055
Why should he play by some
arbitrary rule when the world doesn't?

32:14.015 --> 32:16.184
Because there's still right and wrong.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.186
Then why do you do what you do?

32:18.269 --> 32:20.897
-Because I<i> </i>have<i> </i>to.
-Because you <i>want</i> to.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.484
You don't know my situation.

32:24.567 --> 32:28.571
I know what it feels like to cross a line
you never thought you'd cross.

32:29.906 --> 32:33.117
And so… you move that line.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.244
Soon enough…

32:36.412 --> 32:38.414
you don't know where it's supposed to be.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.959
What's your point?

32:41.542 --> 32:44.087
You wouldn't know "normal"
if it sat on your face.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.094
Now what's wrong with your salmon?

32:53.137 --> 32:54.347
It's a little rare.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.933
-You asked for it cooked through?
-It's all right.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.606
Excuse me a minute.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.370
You really didn't have to do this.

33:17.453 --> 33:21.457

with a few cans of soup, right? [chuckles]

some bread crumbs. Carl likes it crunchy.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.925

33:36.848 --> 33:37.682
[Carl] Uh, so…

33:37.765 --> 33:43.312
We are obviously
in a unique, uh, situation here. Uh…

33:44.022 --> 33:45.690
You can say that again.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.692
And instead of beating around the bush,

33:47.775 --> 33:53.114
figured we'd set up some kind
of financial arrangement.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.158

to talk about money.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.245
Oh! Ain't that the truth.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.580
So how about we don't?

34:01.914 --> 34:08.379
[clicks tongue] Uh, I'm afraid that
that is the whole reason we are here.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.717
[Mrs. Haskins] When you gave us that car--

34:12.800 --> 34:14.218
[Carl] Like it was no problem.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.012
It kind of got me and Carl thinking.

34:16.095 --> 34:18.639
I'm sorry. I got to stop you right here.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.644
Something bad happened to your family.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.898
But guess what? Bad things happen.

34:26.981 --> 34:29.984
You don't get a fair shake
just because you're a good person.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.444
Some people get lucky

34:31.527 --> 34:35.782
and some people just keep
drawing that same damn short straw.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.117
So let me be clear.

34:38.993 --> 34:42.371
Your life is not our fault.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.541
We don't owe you a thing. Believe me.

34:45.625 --> 34:49.879
Every day we look in the mirror
and hate ourselves for a bunch of reasons.

34:49.962 --> 34:53.716
But our daughter
living and breathing isn't one of them.

35:08.564 --> 35:09.565
What's this?

35:11.192 --> 35:12.193
Eighty-seven dollars.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.446
For what?

35:16.114 --> 35:19.659
Carl didn't feel right accepting the car.

35:19.742 --> 35:23.371
Wanted to set up a monthly plan.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.623
Wish it could be more,

35:25.706 --> 35:29.502

It's my pleasure.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.926
How rare was the salmon?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.473
I mean, it wasn't to my liking.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.808
But it doesn't mean
he should have his face bashed in.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.353
Did he actually order radishes?

37:10.436 --> 37:12.772
