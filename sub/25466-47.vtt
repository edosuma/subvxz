a hidden passageway
behind this wall.

Maybe this lever
activates a secret trap door.

a mysterious hatch
that leads to the craps table.

thick Magnum P.I. chest hair.

-Fred?

they could be friendlier?

the question correctly
or face the elimination.

Don't worry.
I know why people think
we're an abomination.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.615
It's because
they haven't gotten
to know us yet.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.051
That's not it, dude.

06:42.010 --> 06:45.317
Why is the Scooby gang
so much more entertaining
and funny

06:45.361 --> 06:48.973
and all-around better
than those lame, stupid
dum-dums, the Teen Titans?

06:49.017 --> 06:51.541
-[buzzing]
-Because of versatile
voice actor Frank Welker.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.108
Like, who's Frank Welker?

06:53.151 --> 06:54.501
Frank Welker
is the voice actor

06:54.544 --> 06:56.677
behind all of my
favorite cartoon characters.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.462
Megatron from Transformers,
Slimer from
The Real Ghostbusters,

and even Scooby-Doo.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.248
-Me?
-Don't worry.

07:03.292 --> 07:06.164
There's no way our voices
come from some guy
named Frank.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.213
Is Frank Welker up there?

[bell dings]

07:12.519 --> 07:15.260
All right, tell me,

07:15.304 --> 07:18.829
why is the Scooby gang
so much more entertaining

07:18.873 --> 07:21.092
and funny, and all-around
better than you?

07:21.136 --> 07:24.444
I refuse to
further debase myself,
Control Freak.

07:24.487 --> 07:27.751
So, you forfeit? Great.
I'll cancel you right now.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.667
-[laser whizzes]
-Wait. I'll do it.

07:30.711 --> 07:34.628
[sighs] Is it because
they get along
like a real team?

07:34.671 --> 07:36.978
Yeah, you guys
are horrible at that.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.588
Is teamwork on the board?

07:38.632 --> 07:40.503

And a good day
to you, sir.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.824
Hey, hey. Focus. Your answer.

07:56.867 --> 08:00.436
Is it because
the Scooby Doobies
always do the right thing?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.873
Is moral compass up there?

08:02.917 --> 08:04.745
[bell dings]

08:04.788 --> 08:07.487
Oh, I know the next one.
They don't try so hard
to be funny.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.140
They're naturally charming.

08:09.184 --> 08:12.013
Because they're way funnier
than the Titans.

if you get this right,
you win the game

-[Shaggy] I totally agree.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.555
Well, on the bright side,

09:59.599 --> 10:02.906
I get to get unmasked
by the Scooby gang.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.474
-Ew.
-Normally we would,

10:05.517 --> 10:07.041
but you're awfully greasy.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.088
Like, I never thought
I'd say this,

10:11.132 --> 10:13.177
but I think
I just lost my appetite.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.310
Me too.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.486
Don't feel bad you never
figured out this mystery.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.966
Our show can be
a little out there.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.272
I think I have
a pretty good hunch, actually.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.536
We were inserted
into this episode
as a cheap ratings ploy,

10:24.580 --> 10:27.931
and the Teen Titans
are merely trading on
the Scooby gang's good name.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.891
Like, I bet
this Frank Welker guy
would not approve.

10:30.934 --> 10:31.979
Uh-uh.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.198
[all agreeing]

10:34.242 --> 10:37.288
Well, gangs, looks like
we can go back to
our respective worlds.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.813
Not so fast, Freddie boy.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.859
There is still
one unmasking left to do.

10:42.903 --> 10:46.080
Wait! [distorted] No!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.958
[all] Baron von Billfold?

10:55.002 --> 10:57.526
[in German accent]
Yes, and I would have
gotten away with it

10:57.569 --> 11:00.355
if it weren't for you
meddling Titans.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.706
Jeepers, Fred, how could you?
Jeepers.

11:03.750 --> 11:07.971
[stammering] Look, gang,
I was gonna tell you...
eventually.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.147
[audience laughs]

11:10.191 --> 11:12.062
[both] Scooby Dooby Doo.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.935
[all laughing]
