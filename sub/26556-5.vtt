00:05.109 --> 00:06.768
<i>the only way to achieve my goal</i>

00:06.793 --> 00:10.359

to being the Green Arrow.</i>

00:10.384 --> 00:14.061

carry on my mission without me.</i>

00:21.780 --> 00:23.370
I am Dr. Jarrett Parker.

00:23.450 --> 00:25.420
I'm here to conduct your
psychiatric evaluation.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.630
- What is your name?
- My name is Oliver Queen.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.950
Laurel: You kidnapped and
imprisoned the Silencer?

00:29.951 --> 00:30.583
Felicity: She's gone.

00:30.608 --> 00:33.080
Laurel: How'd you know she was
gonna take the belt?

00:33.090 --> 00:35.260
The RFID chip I installed in it is
gonna lead us straight to Diaz.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.510
- Where is Diaz?
- I don't know,

00:37.520 --> 00:39.310
but I know who does.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.430
Everything that goes on here
goes through the Demon first.

00:41.510 --> 00:44.230
What will you do
after you find this person?

00:44.310 --> 00:46.560
I will use them to stop Diaz.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.480
Still resistant.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.780
Agh!

00:49.850 --> 00:50.940
Parker: What is your name?

00:51.020 --> 00:53.370
My name is inmate 4587.

On your feet, 4587.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.180
- Who are you?
- Your new best friend.

01:18.190 --> 01:21.190
Now on your feet.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.810
Hold out your hand.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.520
This will be on you at all times

01:41.600 --> 01:43.230
to ensure the safety of yourself

01:43.310 --> 01:44.990
and the other prisoners.

[Beep beep]

01:51.150 --> 01:52.660
Where's Dr. Parker?

01:52.740 --> 01:55.700
He said you're ready
for phase two,

01:55.780 --> 02:00.580
which means you belong
to me now.

02:00.660 --> 02:04.080
- Move.
- Where are you taking me?

02:04.160 --> 02:05.680
Down the rabbit hole.

02:24.710 --> 02:26.220
Welcome home.

02:26.300 --> 02:31.140
Woman on P.A.: Inmate 10-13.
Inmate 10-13.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.720
Man: No, no.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.640
No, please, please.
No, no.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.400
Oliver: Where are they taking him?

02:37.480 --> 02:39.940
Pray you never find out.

02:41.980 --> 02:44.160
Your wife is dead.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.290
Guard: Friend of yours?

02:49.360 --> 02:50.410
No.

02:52.570 --> 02:55.080
Is there a problem?

02:55.090 --> 02:57.580
No. No problem.

02:57.590 --> 03:01.470
Good. Keep it that way.

03:03.740 --> 03:05.210
When's visitation?

03:05.290 --> 03:07.420
There's no visitation down here.

03:07.430 --> 03:10.380
No... what do...
what do you mean?

03:10.460 --> 03:13.050
It's probably best that you forget

03:13.130 --> 03:15.980
about anyone on the outside.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.280
They'll eventually forget about you.

Bell: I read through your mission report

03:36.350 --> 03:37.650
from the Switzerland op.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.110
Director Michaels signed off,

03:39.190 --> 03:41.110
but I noticed a few abnormalities.

03:41.190 --> 03:42.910
Sir, if this is regarding the 23 minutes

03:42.980 --> 03:44.450
of unaccounted time in our field log,

03:44.530 --> 03:47.170
it is because we took a pit stop

03:47.250 --> 03:48.800
for chocolate.

03:48.870 --> 03:50.500
When in Rome, right?

03:50.510 --> 03:52.370
Do you want some?
You should have some.

03:52.390 --> 03:54.180
- Actually, I'm diabetic.
- Oh, ok. Don't have some.

03:54.250 --> 03:57.800
And I was referring to the intel
we got from that mission.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.340
This is Malcolm Byrd,
a black market arms dealer

04:00.350 --> 04:02.380
specializing in chemical
weapons trading.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.140
The data we pulled from the bank

04:04.210 --> 04:05.930
tipped us off to
an ongoing transaction

04:06.010 --> 04:07.510
involving a gentleman...

04:07.530 --> 04:10.020
Dr. Nyambi Somto, biochemist.

04:10.030 --> 04:11.520
Two weeks ago, Somto
went missing

04:11.530 --> 04:13.020
along with a cache of nerve agents banned

04:13.030 --> 04:14.130
by the Geneva protocols.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.300
We believe that Somto's trying to sell

04:16.380 --> 04:17.940
these chemicals to Byrd.

04:17.970 --> 04:20.880
Bell: Fortunately, A.R.G.U.S.
already has Somto in custody.

04:20.890 --> 04:23.060
So mission accomplished.
Yay.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.730
Not exactly. Byrd still believes
the buy is going on,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.560
which means we can catch him.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.230
That's where you come in, Holt.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.150
Why is there a mock-up photo of me

04:31.220 --> 04:32.900
I.D.ed as Dr. Somto?

04:32.980 --> 04:34.520
John: We need an undercover operative

04:34.530 --> 04:35.990
to impersonate Somto

04:36.060 --> 04:37.610
and make contact with Byrd.

04:37.690 --> 04:39.270
Somto claims he and Byrd
only interfaced online,

04:39.280 --> 04:41.150
never face to face, thus the mock-up.

04:41.230 --> 04:43.900
Uh, why does it have to be my face?

04:43.910 --> 04:46.530
We need someone who can pull
off a convincing charade.

04:46.610 --> 04:48.820
You have 14 phds, including one

04:48.900 --> 04:50.320
in biochemical engineering,

04:50.400 --> 04:51.830
and you're fluent in 5 different languages,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.700
including Somto's native tongue.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.210
6, actually.
Nowadays, I'm more

04:56.280 --> 04:58.540
of a chill in the back of a Van,

04:58.620 --> 05:00.500
surrounded by monitors kind of a guy.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.590
Curtis, we don't need you to engage.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.510
Just put eyes on Byrd.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.880
Me and my team will handle the takedown

05:05.960 --> 05:07.270
and package retrieval.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.510
Also...

05:08.590 --> 05:10.150

Oliver: Hey.

05:36.110 --> 05:38.530
I know it was the Demon
who hired you to attack me.

05:38.610 --> 05:39.980
Stop talking to me.

05:40.060 --> 05:42.360
Tell me who the Demon is.

05:42.370 --> 05:45.200
- Leave me alone.
- Hey. Hey.

05:45.270 --> 05:47.700
Ugh!

05:47.780 --> 05:49.700
It was an accident, I swear.

[Grunting]

05:56.630 --> 05:59.130
Looks like you're having a relapse.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.050
We warned you about this.

06:01.130 --> 06:02.380
You know what happens now.

06:02.460 --> 06:03.390
I'm sorry.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.720
It won't happen again.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.260
[Crackling]

06:08.340 --> 06:10.350

06:10.360 --> 06:12.510

06:12.590 --> 06:14.520

[Door slams shut]

06:26.560 --> 06:28.490
[Computer beeping]

06:28.570 --> 06:30.490
The tracker is now paired with
a facial recognition program,

06:30.570 --> 06:32.660
targeting all cctv and traffic cameras

06:32.740 --> 06:35.200
within a 5-mile radius of the Silencer's
location, updating in real time.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.330
So when the Silencer
finally finds Diaz,

06:37.410 --> 06:39.000
we'll get an immediate alert?

06:39.080 --> 06:40.670
Yeah, as long as you don't
adjust any of the inputs,

06:40.740 --> 06:42.500
change any of the settings,
or click any buttons.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.340
I mean, basically,
don't touch anything,

06:44.420 --> 06:46.090
and, yeah, we will be...
we will be... we will be just fine.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.930
I'm not sure I needed
an in-person tutorial

06:47.940 --> 06:50.180
on how to watch a blinking dot blink.

06:50.190 --> 06:53.440
Sorry.
I'm just really anxious, you know?

06:53.820 --> 06:55.400
We're so close to getting Diaz,

06:55.480 --> 06:57.070
and the last time I saw
Oliver was a while ago,

06:57.140 --> 06:58.990
and it didn't end so well.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.700
Relax. Visiting your husband
is not gonna cause

07:00.770 --> 07:02.580
our operation to fall apart.

07:02.660 --> 07:04.450
[Computer beeps]

07:04.460 --> 07:06.770
Although when the blinking dot disappears,

07:06.850 --> 07:07.900
that's not good, is it?

07:07.930 --> 07:09.240
- Crap!
- Hey. I wanted it noted

07:09.320 --> 07:11.020
for the record I did not touch anything.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.900
- Is the signal dead?
- No. It's just faint.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.490
It's still pinging, but I'm
gonna need to boost the signal

07:14.560 --> 07:16.150
to get a secure lock on her exact location,

07:16.230 --> 07:17.740
which may take a while,
so maybe I should stay here,

07:17.750 --> 07:19.660
keep an eye on the program,
you know, just...

07:19.730 --> 07:21.410
You can keep an eye on the
program from the road.

07:21.420 --> 07:23.160
Ok, but the moment...

07:23.240 --> 07:24.580
The signal comes back online,
you want me to call you.

07:24.660 --> 07:26.370
Yes. Look at us,

07:26.450 --> 07:27.750
you know, finishing
each other's sentences.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.000
- We got some...
- Go.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.590
Mm-hmm.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.740
If not for Oliver's sake,
at least for my own.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.580
[Squeak]

07:55.210 --> 07:58.461
I understand you've been
looking for the Demon.

08:02.317 --> 08:03.900
Talia?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.950
You survived the explosion on Lian Yu.

08:11.030 --> 08:12.530
- How?
- You know I'm not

08:12.600 --> 08:14.040
so easily defeated.

08:14.110 --> 08:15.910
What are you doing here?

08:15.920 --> 08:19.330
Oh. I ran afoul of an old foe in Gotham.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.960
What surprised me was to
see you here, a prisoner.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.620
I believe I taught you better than that.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.420
Oh, you taught me many things,

08:27.490 --> 08:31.250
including how to manipulate people.

08:31.330 --> 08:34.309
So the attack in the shower,

08:34.380 --> 08:36.590
Brick's mind games...

08:36.669 --> 08:39.299
You pushed every button
and pulled every string

08:39.380 --> 08:41.179
just to get me down here.

08:41.190 --> 08:42.929
You always were a quick study.

08:43.010 --> 08:46.150
Where's Ricardo Diaz?

08:46.230 --> 08:47.980
- I don't know.
- Liar.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.990
I'm many things,

08:50.070 --> 08:54.330
but a liar is not one of them.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.280
You asked how I survived Lian Yu.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.210
The answer is barely...

09:02.530 --> 09:06.080
And only with the help of
a drug supplied by your Mr. Diaz,

09:06.160 --> 09:08.460
so in exchange,
I facilitated an attack

09:08.540 --> 09:11.290
on the man who murdered my
father, left me for dead.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.010
More than a fair trade.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.510
There was a time, Talia,

09:17.520 --> 09:21.100
when aligning yourself with
a man like Ricardo Diaz

09:21.170 --> 09:23.400
would have been beneath you.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.440
I do what it takes to survive.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.690
Another lesson you seem to have forgotten.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.440
I taught you to separate
the man from the monster.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.820
Instead, you exposed your true identity

09:35.900 --> 09:37.870
for all the world to see

09:37.950 --> 09:40.040
and became the monster
you always feared you were.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.880
What do you want from me?

09:41.950 --> 09:43.710
There is a way out of Slabside,

09:43.790 --> 09:45.620
and I need your help to escape.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.460
You expect me to help you

09:48.530 --> 09:51.040
after all the pain and the suffering

09:51.050 --> 09:54.210
that you inflicted on my family?

09:54.220 --> 09:56.630
What does it tell you that
I would even ask for your help

09:56.710 --> 09:58.430
after what you've done to mine?

10:04.590 --> 10:07.060
You don't understand what
they do to people down here.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.520
They reform criminals.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.150
They destroy them.

10:11.220 --> 10:14.110
You and I once stood on the same side.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.820
We can do it again.

10:15.890 --> 10:18.450
You stood on the same side
as Adrian chase...

10:20.570 --> 10:23.320
And my son lost his mother,

10:23.400 --> 10:26.460
so now I'm here, trying to save

10:26.540 --> 10:30.370
what's left of my family

10:30.450 --> 10:32.920
because I'm stuck

10:32.930 --> 10:37.010
in a cycle of violence,
and I have been stuck there

10:37.080 --> 10:38.920
since the moment

10:38.930 --> 10:42.050
you told me what to do
with my father's list.

10:42.130 --> 10:44.010
You don't honestly believe that, Oliver.

10:44.090 --> 10:46.430
There's no Oliver in here.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.890
I'm inmate 4587,

10:48.970 --> 10:53.700
so I'm asking you, however
you broke into my cell...

10:55.780 --> 10:57.330
Get out.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.790
[Indistinct chatter]

11:05.610 --> 11:07.580
[Door opens, keys jingle]

11:07.650 --> 11:10.330
Uh, excuse me.
My husband is Oliver Queen,

11:10.410 --> 11:12.040
and as your colleagues have
already triple-checked,

11:12.120 --> 11:13.630
I am definitely on his visitor's list.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.420
It's been 20 minutes,
and he's not here.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.970
Inmate 4587 has had his
visitation privileges revoked.

11:19.050 --> 11:21.220
What? What happened?
What are you talking about?

11:21.290 --> 11:23.550
I'm not at Liberty to say, ma'am.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.720
I'm his wife.
I have a right to see my husband.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.310
I'm afraid you don't.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.080
- You're Oliver's wife.
- Yeah.

11:40.150 --> 11:42.150
I recognize you from the picture
he looks at all the time.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.950
You know Oliver.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.490
I'm kind of his sidekick in here.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.280
Can you give him
a message for me?

11:47.360 --> 11:49.330
Can you tell him that
I have a lead on Diaz?

11:49.340 --> 11:51.120
- He'll know what it means.
- I know what that means.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.840
He'll be so excited,

11:52.920 --> 11:55.340
but I can't give him that message.

11:55.420 --> 11:56.920
Why not?

11:56.990 --> 11:59.590
Because he got sent down to Level Two.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.260
What's Level Two?

12:01.330 --> 12:03.590
It's bad, it's really bad.

12:03.670 --> 12:05.190
It's where they send
the worst of the worst.

12:05.260 --> 12:07.930
But Oliver isn't
the worst of the worst.

12:08.010 --> 12:10.350
It's kind of a long story,
but he got set up,

12:10.360 --> 12:14.270
and then he had to
stab a guard or two.

12:14.350 --> 12:15.940
It all kind of happened fast,

12:16.010 --> 12:17.530
and there was a lot of blood.

12:17.610 --> 12:18.940
No. Oliver...
Oliver would never...

12:19.020 --> 12:20.780
He would never do something like that.

12:20.850 --> 12:22.870
I don't know if you've noticed,

12:22.950 --> 12:25.870
but the guards aren't exactly
on the side of good in here.

12:25.950 --> 12:27.280
- I should go.
- Wait just one second.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.160
Sorry about your husband.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.840
He's the best.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.460
Target sighted.

12:41.540 --> 12:43.630
Heading into the sketchy
loading dock to confirm.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.550
Ok, Curtis.
Once you get firm confirmation,

12:45.560 --> 12:47.230
we'll move in but not before,

12:47.300 --> 12:48.970
so keep it cool, ok?

12:49.050 --> 12:50.900
Sure. That will be easy
to do in wool pants.

12:51.818 --> 12:54.265
<font color="#ffff00">Are you dr.Nyambi somoto?</font>

12:54.290 --> 12:57.370
<font color="#ffff00">That would be me. And you are?</font>

12:57.768 --> 13:00.750
<font color="#ffff00">Here to verify the product.</font>

13:00.975 --> 13:02.320
<font color="#ffff00">Where is it?</font>

13:14.280 --> 13:16.250
John: We still don't have eyes on Byrd.

13:16.260 --> 13:17.340
Find out why.

13:18.258 --> 13:23.929
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, but I was
supposed to meet Mr. Byrd here.</font>

13:23.954 --> 13:25.843
<font color="#ffff00">With the money.</font>

13:25.868 --> 13:26.705
<font color="#ffff00">Where is he?</font>

13:26.730 --> 13:28.820
<font color="#ffff00">You have more of this, correct?</font>

13:28.821 --> 13:30.430
Uh...

13:30.440 --> 13:32.560
You do.
Yes, you do, Curtis.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.610
[French accent]
Yes. Yes. I do.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.440
You speak english.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.940
Bring you entire supply to the
Mandrake Gallery tomorrow, 8 P.M.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.230
Monsieur Byrd will be waiting.

13:42.310 --> 13:43.730
You'll get your money then.

13:43.810 --> 13:45.780
Wait.

13:45.850 --> 13:49.120
A second meeting was not
a part of our agreement.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.750
Do we have a problem, Dr. Somto?

13:51.830 --> 13:54.080
John: What are you doing?
Just agree to the meeting.

13:54.150 --> 13:55.370
Curtis!

13:55.450 --> 14:00.630
No. No problem at all.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.380
What the hell was that?

14:02.450 --> 14:03.800
You said this was
a one-time deal...

14:03.810 --> 14:05.590
Meet the guy, get out, done.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.010
Getting roped into the sequel
was not part of the plan!

14:08.080 --> 14:09.340
We're in the field.

14:09.420 --> 14:11.090
Sometimes, plans change in the field!

14:11.170 --> 14:13.260
You, of all people, should know that!

14:13.340 --> 14:15.820
Look. My days in the field were over

14:15.890 --> 14:17.810
the day Oliver went to prison.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.560
I would like to keep it that way.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.490
Curtis, we still need to nail Byrd.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.520
We can't do that without you!

14:23.530 --> 14:25.990
Well, then you better hope I have
a twin or a clone or something

14:26.070 --> 14:28.150
because I am not doing that again!

14:28.160 --> 14:29.330
I'm out!

14:31.480 --> 14:33.490
That doesn't make any sense.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.170
Mr. Queen has two hours

14:35.250 --> 14:36.830
of visitation left this month,

14:36.840 --> 14:38.830
so I suggest you get it straightened out,

14:38.840 --> 14:40.840
or I will have the U.S.
attorney so far up your ass

14:40.920 --> 14:42.580
that you'll have to turn
your head to the left

14:42.660 --> 14:44.090
and cough.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.960
Whew! I mean, no offense to black siren,

14:47.040 --> 14:49.020
but I actually think you're
scarier as an attorney.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.680
Black siren gets results.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.890
All the D.A. got was stonewalled.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.850
Prison authorities
insisted that Oliver

14:54.860 --> 14:57.430
already maxed his visitation
allowances this month.

14:57.510 --> 15:00.180
How? I've only been there once.
I...

15:00.200 --> 15:02.770
Something's wrong.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.320
Obviously.

15:05.890 --> 15:09.200
Sorry. Empathy's a word I'm learning.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.950
It's a work in progress.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.370
The prisoner that knew Oliver said

15:12.450 --> 15:13.710
they took him somewhere called Level Two.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.950
We need to figure out
what that is.

15:15.030 --> 15:16.200
We?

15:16.210 --> 15:17.830
Consider it a lesson in empathy.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.210
Ok. I'm accessing
the federal Slabside records...

15:19.290 --> 15:21.050
Employment, inmate sentencing,

15:21.120 --> 15:22.370
infrastructure.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.040
I don't know what's more amusing...

15:24.050 --> 15:25.840
The fact that you just broke
6 laws in front of me

15:25.910 --> 15:28.500
or that you're forcing me to
feel empathetic about it.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.260
What? What's wrong?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.890
Wherever they took Oliver is
completely off the books.

15:32.970 --> 15:35.600
There's no record of anything
at Slabside called Level Two.

15:41.220 --> 15:42.530
[Door sliding open]

16:18.490 --> 16:20.610
Oliver: What the hell happened to him?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.940
You don't recognize a dead body?

16:24.020 --> 16:26.410
What goes on in that room?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.120
That's where they reform you.

16:28.190 --> 16:30.280
Therapy doesn't kill people, Talia.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.990
You have a surprising amount of empathy

16:32.000 --> 16:33.500
for a man who assaulted you.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.500
He's dead because

16:35.510 --> 16:37.620
of whatever happened behind those doors.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.920
Then he's one of the lucky ones.

16:39.930 --> 16:41.470
- What?
- Those who walk out alive

16:41.550 --> 16:43.930
suffer much more.

16:44.010 --> 16:47.130
You have no idea what your doctor
is really doing down here.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.800
Come on.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.350
Dr. Parker's behind this?

16:51.420 --> 16:53.190
Not so quick a study after all.

16:53.270 --> 16:55.730
You fell for Parker's lies.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.190
That's what happens when you fail
to keep your two sides separate.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.690
You become weak.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.650
Whatever is happening,
we need to stop it.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.040
These people are criminals

17:05.109 --> 17:08.040
the likes of which you've spent
the past 6 years putting away.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.210
I'm surprised you want to help them.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.540
But you were the one who pushed
me towards helping others,

17:13.550 --> 17:17.619
towards fighting for justice.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.380
You had honor then.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.540
That was a long time ago.

17:22.619 --> 17:25.300
Now all I care about is
getting out of here.

17:25.369 --> 17:28.630
Are you prepared to help me with that?

17:28.710 --> 17:30.810
Then we have nothing further to discuss.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.850
I need to see Dr. Parker.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.410
That's not how it works.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.870
I need his help.
I'm having a relapse.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.740
Hey, Dinah.
Do you have a sec?

17:50.750 --> 17:52.420
Yeah. Uh, is this about the Hudson case?

17:52.490 --> 17:54.370
Because I would like to get
3 counts if we can.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.870
Felicity: Hi, Dinah.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.260
Hi. Wow. Ok.
Since when are you two friends?

17:58.330 --> 18:01.000
Well, we decided to start a support group
for women who've been attacked by Diaz.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.500
Laurel: Or his assassins.
Do you care to join?

18:04.580 --> 18:06.010
Dinah: Uh, thanks, I'll pass,

18:06.090 --> 18:07.840
but, hey, maybe you should get back

18:07.920 --> 18:09.260
to witness protection

18:09.330 --> 18:10.760
and you should head on back to Earth Two

18:10.840 --> 18:12.930
before you both remember
you hate each other.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.010
Ok. Real talk. We're working
together, and we need your help.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.270
- We?
- It's called empathy, Dinah.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.060
I'm about 100% sure that's not
what we're dealing with here,

18:19.140 --> 18:20.940
but what is going on?

18:21.010 --> 18:22.770
Slabside is denying
Felicity access to Oliver.

18:22.850 --> 18:24.450
Felicity: They're keeping him
somewhere called Level Two,

18:24.530 --> 18:26.570
but there's no record
of anything at Slabside

18:26.640 --> 18:28.290
called Level Two, so we dove
into the employee records,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.110
- and we found something.
- Yes. A psychiatrist by the name

18:30.120 --> 18:32.280
of Dr. Jarrett Parker with a "P."

18:32.290 --> 18:34.740
We need you to check to see if
there were any complaints made

18:34.820 --> 18:36.870
to the SCPD about Parker
during his private practice.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.910
Surprised you didn't just
hack into SCPD yourself.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.800
Oh, I did. There was just
nothing in the digital records.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.790
I was hoping to do this
the old-fashioned way

18:42.800 --> 18:45.540
and go through the hard
copies in the SCPD archive.

18:45.550 --> 18:49.050
Dinah: Ok, but what makes us
believe this Parker guy is shady?

18:49.120 --> 18:53.010
Slabside doesn't have a psychiatric
program for their inmates.

18:53.090 --> 18:57.430
Felicity: Whatever Parker is
doing is not being reported.

18:57.510 --> 19:00.140
Please. If Oliver is in trouble,

19:00.150 --> 19:01.570
we have to help him.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.820
Surprised to see you here.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.320
Thought you'd be out.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.730
Well, still have a job to do,

19:08.810 --> 19:10.330
you know, the one that doesn't involve

19:10.400 --> 19:12.000
possibly dismemberment and/or death.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.990
Since when have you been
afraid of any of that?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.990
- Since always.
- You know what I mean.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.490
You always ran the risk
of dying with team arrow.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.160
Why is it any different
now with A.R.G.U.S.?

19:20.170 --> 19:22.160
It just is.
Let's leave it at that.

19:22.170 --> 19:24.840
No. We can't just leave it at that.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.510
You're sidelining yourself.
I want to know why.

19:29.660 --> 19:32.520
I just don't have it in me anymore.

19:32.590 --> 19:34.060
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

19:36.600 --> 19:40.520
Oliver's in prison. Even he
couldn't outrun the risk

19:40.530 --> 19:44.100
that it takes to be out there fighting.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.700
This life has cost me my marriage,

19:46.770 --> 19:49.650
gotten me stabbed,
and people I love shot.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.650
Maybe you and Lyla
and everyone else has

19:52.730 --> 19:54.040
what it takes to cope with it,

19:54.110 --> 19:57.160
but I can't keep lying to myself.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.210
Being Mr. Terrific...

20:02.200 --> 20:05.370
It's just not me anymore.

20:05.380 --> 20:10.550
John: I've been at war, seen
the faces of men who are done.

20:10.630 --> 20:12.390
Curtis, that is not you.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.050
Yeah. I am pretty sure that is me.

20:14.060 --> 20:16.010
[Scoffs]

20:16.090 --> 20:21.060
14 phds, fluent in multiple languages,

20:21.070 --> 20:23.180
genius, bronze medal decathlete.

20:23.260 --> 20:26.060
Mr. Terrific isn't just an
alter ego you can lay aside.

20:26.070 --> 20:28.910
It's who you are, Curtis.

20:28.980 --> 20:32.120
The only real risk you're running
is denying the truth in that.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.750
Now, I respect your decision
to sit out this mission.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.750
Just make sure it's the right one.

20:44.420 --> 20:48.670
When did you notice
the rage happening?

20:48.740 --> 20:51.640
When I saw the inmate with
the grim reaper tattoo.

20:51.710 --> 20:56.380
Interesting. Why do you think you
responded so negatively to him?

20:56.460 --> 20:59.470
He was among the group who
attacked me on level one.

20:59.550 --> 21:05.640
Hmm. Well, the good news is you didn't
give in to your violent tendencies.

21:05.720 --> 21:09.350
You came here. That means
the treatment is working.

21:09.430 --> 21:15.240
Dr. Parker, the main reason
that I didn't do anything was

21:15.310 --> 21:17.610
he was dead.

21:17.620 --> 21:20.780
I... I saw him being
w-wheeled out of the room

21:20.790 --> 21:23.740
with the blue door.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.960
Unfortunately, some inmates don't respond

21:27.970 --> 21:30.800
as well as you to the process.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.460
When you're breaking new scientific ground,

21:33.470 --> 21:35.470
setbacks are inevitable.

21:35.550 --> 21:39.300
It seems like a... ahem...
Prisoner dying is

21:39.310 --> 21:42.470
a little bit more than a setback.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.150
Look at what we've done together,

21:45.230 --> 21:48.810
h-how we've eliminated
that part of yourself

21:48.820 --> 21:51.730
that was trapped in a cycle of violence.

21:51.740 --> 21:55.110
Imagine that on a grander scale.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.650
The world would be
a much safer place.

21:57.660 --> 22:02.910
Right, but people are dying.

22:02.980 --> 22:05.910
What about them?

22:05.990 --> 22:12.290
That sounds like something
the old you would say, 4587,

22:12.370 --> 22:15.590
the hero who insisted on
righting the wrongs of strangers

22:15.600 --> 22:18.720
at the expense of the
safety and well-being

22:18.730 --> 22:20.430
of the people he loves.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.140
I thought you weren't
that person anymore.

22:23.210 --> 22:24.770
I'm not.

22:28.010 --> 22:30.440
Good.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.940
You need to continue
focusing on yourself,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.520
on the man you need to be

22:36.540 --> 22:38.490
for the sake of your family.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.570
If you're unable to do that,

22:41.650 --> 22:43.950
we'll be forced

22:44.030 --> 22:47.670
to pursue some
other treatment options.

22:50.210 --> 22:52.870
Felicity: Why is an
arrest report from 1985

22:52.890 --> 22:55.340
in the same box as an
employee file from 2002?

22:55.410 --> 22:57.170
It doesn't make any sense!

22:57.250 --> 22:58.960
Well, after the department
switched to computerized files,

22:59.040 --> 23:00.840
they just stopped taking
care of this place.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.840
You mean, the SCPD is
late to the digital party?

23:03.920 --> 23:06.180
Wow! Shocking.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.560
Felicity, there may be
some other options.

23:08.570 --> 23:10.060
Now I still have friends in the FBI.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.350
- I can call...
- Because the FBI is known

23:12.430 --> 23:14.350
for their speed and efficiency?

23:14.370 --> 23:16.560
Do you have a better idea?

23:16.580 --> 23:19.240
Yes. I asked the U.S.
attorney to file a motion

23:19.320 --> 23:22.080
compelling Slabside to
release all their records.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.700
Oh, and you think
my way is slow!

23:23.770 --> 23:26.200
That could take weeks, months.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.250
Oliver may not have weeks,
he may not have months!

23:28.330 --> 23:30.300
He may not even have days!
We don't know where he is.

23:32.380 --> 23:35.670
I had no idea what his life
had become in there,

23:35.740 --> 23:38.100
the things that he's had to do.

23:38.170 --> 23:41.550
Laurel: Felicity, you've been focused
on catching a homicidal maniac.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.760
If anybody understands that, it's Oliver.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.770
Dinah: And Oliver's the one
who decided to go to prison.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.350
This isn't on you.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.100
And I was pissed
about that decision.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.610
I should have visited him more.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.440
I should have been
able to prevent this.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:55.110 --> 23:57.780
Look. I get it, ok, but trust me,

23:57.860 --> 24:00.610
there is nothing you could have done.

24:00.620 --> 24:03.370
You have to stop blaming yourself.

24:03.450 --> 24:07.460
I thought that the worst
thing that could happen

24:07.530 --> 24:09.420
was me losing my husband to prison.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.550
Well, what if I lose him permanently?

24:23.660 --> 24:27.850
Ahem. If you still want to get
out of here, we go tonight.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.840
Well, I'm glad you've finally
come to your senses,

24:29.850 --> 24:31.630
though I suspect your willingness

24:31.710 --> 24:34.440
to conspire comes with...
conditions.

24:34.510 --> 24:38.810
I need you to help me expose
the truth about Dr. Parker.

24:38.890 --> 24:40.430
And how do you propose we do that?

24:40.510 --> 24:42.850
The evidence we need is
behind those blue doors.

24:42.860 --> 24:45.190
We break in, we get it, we escape.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.940
That would be unwise.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.820
You've seen what happens to
people who go into that room.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.070
They come out in body bags.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.360
Talia, we are doing this my way,

24:51.440 --> 24:52.910
or we're not doing it at all.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.490
You'd risk both our lives

24:54.570 --> 24:56.210
to help these prisoners, despite knowing

24:56.280 --> 24:58.450
that every last one is
a murderer or worse?

24:58.530 --> 25:02.200
These people are being treated
like they are disposable.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.670
- No one deserves that.
- Tell me, did you feel

25:04.740 --> 25:07.290
that same compassion when you rammed
a sword through my father's chest?

25:07.370 --> 25:09.470
No, because back then,
I still allowed the monster

25:09.550 --> 25:11.670
that you helped unleash take over.

25:11.750 --> 25:14.550
Don't insinuate that my father's
death was somehow my fault.

25:14.630 --> 25:18.550
Look. I...
Ra's' death was my fault.

25:18.630 --> 25:23.680
I couldn't see past what he
intended to do to my city,

25:23.760 --> 25:26.810
so I didn't stop and think
about his family,

25:26.890 --> 25:30.070
and for that, I am truly sorry.

25:30.150 --> 25:32.030
I know you hate me...

25:34.060 --> 25:36.530
But I was your student once,

25:36.540 --> 25:39.830
and we trusted each other completely.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.830
We need to find that trust again

25:42.910 --> 25:45.210
because it is the only way

25:45.280 --> 25:47.680
both of us will get what we want.

25:52.560 --> 25:56.430
John: Remember, the area surrounding
this meet is densely populated.

25:56.510 --> 25:59.850
Byrd will not hesitate to leverage
this if he suspects something's up.

25:59.920 --> 26:00.940
Dismissed.

26:03.940 --> 26:06.560
But he won't, right,

26:06.640 --> 26:08.900
as long as you all send
me in there alone?

26:08.970 --> 26:13.440
Curtis, that's the hope, but
don't worry, man. You got this.

26:13.450 --> 26:16.540
Right. I just need to turn off the
part of my brain going, "aah!"

26:19.960 --> 26:22.530
Ok. Ready.
What's the plan?

26:22.610 --> 26:24.340
We're gonna give him
exactly what he wants.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.920
The chemical will be housed in this.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.750
The case contains
a hidden targeting system.

26:31.830 --> 26:34.810
Use it to scan the building
and locate the hostiles.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.880
That way, we'll know exactly
where to hit and how hard.

26:37.960 --> 26:41.150
[Scanner beeping]

26:41.220 --> 26:43.980
Once you locate Byrd, hand
off the case and get clear.

[French accent]
A binary chemical bomb.

27:33.140 --> 27:34.530
I didn't take you

27:34.610 --> 27:36.360
for someone as crude
as a terrorist.

27:36.370 --> 27:39.040
What you call crude
I see as lucrative.

27:39.110 --> 27:41.210
All I needed was a fall guy,

27:41.280 --> 27:44.910
and you were far too perfect a Mark.

27:44.990 --> 27:46.830
Perhaps you are forgetting
you are standing

27:46.900 --> 27:49.160
right in front of the bomb.

27:49.240 --> 27:53.040
You've heard of remote
detonation, haven't you?

27:53.050 --> 27:56.000
For someone so smart,
are you really this dumb?

27:56.080 --> 27:57.710
[Normal voice] Well, actually,
if I wanted to do something

27:57.720 --> 27:59.920
super-dumb, I'd probably
do something stupid like

28:00.000 --> 28:01.680
tackle you to the ground,
take that tablet,

28:01.690 --> 28:03.300
and shove it down your throat.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.480
Guess I'm just ready for it.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.580
I do have one request first.

28:20.650 --> 28:24.030
Can you give me a countdown
before you kill me?

28:24.110 --> 28:25.740
First time I've heard that one.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.290
I wasn't talking to you.

Ugh. Yeah. Felicity,
I hate to say it,

30:08.190 --> 30:10.180
but I think we might need to
try a different approach here.

30:10.190 --> 30:11.770
It's not that we're giving up.

30:11.850 --> 30:13.430
It's just that we need to

During Parker's private practice,

Robert Goodman.

It's one of his patients.

to Parker back in 2015

30:27.450 --> 30:30.450
after experiencing
several violent outbursts.

30:30.530 --> 30:32.700
Parker promised the parents he
could make their son docile.

30:32.710 --> 30:37.370
Instead, Goodman began suffering
spontaneous bouts of amnesia.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.130
What the hell was this guy
doing to these people?

30:39.210 --> 30:41.630
It's not clear. Some sort
of experimental treatment.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.920
Looks like Parker's
making a career out of it

30:44.000 --> 30:46.170
because I am looking at
about 8 different cases

35:57.250 --> 35:58.740
That was never the answer.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.080
[Bang against door]

36:00.090 --> 36:01.580
Guard: Someone barricaded this.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.080
Get someone to break this down.

36:03.090 --> 36:07.880
I will make sure
your wife gets this

36:07.960 --> 36:10.600
and that she knows her husband
is as stubborn as ever.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.850
[Crash]

36:13.930 --> 36:15.350
I'll hold them off.

[Bang]

36:54.895 --> 36:56.615
[Footsteps]

37:00.985 --> 37:03.605
Time to go, inmate.

37:03.685 --> 37:05.155
Where are you taking me?

37:05.165 --> 37:06.835
This whole place is getting shut down.

37:06.905 --> 37:08.335
You're going back to level one.

37:12.695 --> 37:15.175
Bethany Snow: Despite official
denials of the allegation

37:15.245 --> 37:17.955
of prisoner abuse
at Slabside penitentiary,

37:18.035 --> 37:20.455
documents provided by SCPD

37:20.535 --> 37:22.795
detailing the cruel
and unusual practices

37:22.875 --> 37:25.335
of Dr. Jarrett Parker, a suspect

37:25.355 --> 37:27.255
in the cold case death of Robert Goodman,

37:27.335 --> 37:29.675
appear to connect
the controversial therapist

37:29.685 --> 37:32.805
to the prison, bringing
those denials into question...

37:32.885 --> 37:35.525
Whoo! One for team Felicity.

37:35.605 --> 37:37.515
I'm still workshopping the name.

37:37.525 --> 37:39.645
Question is which guardian angel do we

37:39.725 --> 37:41.195
have to thank for this little baby?

37:41.275 --> 37:42.695
Oh, don't know, don't care.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.745
Oliver is back sleeping soundly

37:44.755 --> 37:46.585
in his regular maximum
security prison cell

37:46.665 --> 37:48.755
with no evil scientists
trying to fry his brain.

37:48.835 --> 37:51.495
This, plus what we got
from the records room,

37:51.575 --> 37:53.415
is enough to earn Dr. Parker

37:53.425 --> 37:55.595
his own cozy little prison cell.

37:55.675 --> 37:57.835
You know, Slabside's got

37:57.915 --> 37:59.885
a real PR nightmare on
their hands right now.

37:59.955 --> 38:02.715
What if we could use that for more
than just shutting down Level Two?

38:02.795 --> 38:05.185
We can use this to appeal
Oliver's conviction.

38:06.715 --> 38:08.315
We can use it to get
Oliver out of prison.

38:22.035 --> 38:23.615
[Car alarm is disarmed]

38:23.625 --> 38:24.835
Agh!

38:31.805 --> 38:33.805
[Electricity crackling]

38:38.745 --> 38:42.095
You suffering from a relapse, doctor?

38:42.165 --> 38:44.925
Allow me to provide the cure.

38:45.005 --> 38:46.185
No!

38:46.265 --> 38:47.435
[Splat]

38:49.485 --> 38:51.145
You haven't made it home yet?

38:51.155 --> 38:53.065
Ah. Wanted to get the
mission report wrapped up,

38:53.135 --> 38:55.895
make sure there were no
abnormalities for Bell to find.

38:55.975 --> 38:57.985
Yeah. Well, mission reports
don't usually take all night.

38:57.995 --> 38:59.735
Besides, this was
an on-the-books op.

38:59.815 --> 39:01.665
Shouldn't be any abnormalities.

39:01.735 --> 39:04.155
- Then why'd I find one?
- What's this?

39:04.165 --> 39:06.695
Something I lifted off Byrd
before he went into custody.

39:06.775 --> 39:09.415
- Why?
- Lyla copied the bank data

39:09.485 --> 39:11.325
because she suspected A.R.G.U.S.
has something to hide.

39:11.335 --> 39:13.085
That data led us to Byrd.

39:13.155 --> 39:14.665
If there's a deeper
connection that A.R.G.U.S.

39:14.675 --> 39:16.085
Doesn't want anyone to find,

39:16.165 --> 39:17.755
I figure we should know first.

39:17.825 --> 39:19.515
- Worth the risk, right?
- Did you find anything?

39:19.585 --> 39:20.725
Check it out.

39:23.375 --> 39:25.305
It's a painting?
It took you all night

39:25.375 --> 39:27.175
to decrypt a single image?

39:27.185 --> 39:29.135
Do you realize how many decryption
algorithms I had to run

39:29.215 --> 39:30.765
just to get the drive
to boot up?

39:30.845 --> 39:32.695
This thing's security
had security.

39:32.765 --> 39:34.855
All right. Looks like someone
doesn't want us to see this.

39:34.865 --> 39:37.315
- What's the origin?
- Well, this painting is

39:37.395 --> 39:41.815
from the 19th century by a French
artist named Jean-Leon gerome.

39:41.895 --> 39:44.985
The title is "Dante,
he hath seen hell."

39:44.995 --> 39:47.035
- Hidden meaning?
- Pfft. It's art.

39:47.105 --> 39:49.155
There's always a hidden meaning.

39:49.235 --> 39:51.755
We just need to find out
what it is.

39:53.455 --> 39:56.375
[Bars clattering]

Different prisoner: What?
Did you get nostalgic or something?

40:00.795 --> 40:02.715
Different prisoner: Pretty boy walking.

40:02.725 --> 40:04.215
Different prisoner: Did you miss us?

40:04.225 --> 40:07.675
Did someone want to go home?

[Indistinct chatter]

40:11.885 --> 40:13.565
Guess the morgue isn't
the only way out

40:13.645 --> 40:16.185
of Level Two after all.

40:16.265 --> 40:17.895
I'm just glad I made it out of there.

40:17.905 --> 40:19.485
Felicity will be, too.

40:21.815 --> 40:23.355
What do you mean?

40:23.435 --> 40:25.695
She came looking for you in visitation.

40:25.775 --> 40:27.915
I told her about Level Two.

40:27.995 --> 40:30.405
Was she ok?

40:30.415 --> 40:32.915
Yeah. She asked me
to give you a message.

40:32.925 --> 40:34.245
What message?

40:34.255 --> 40:36.085
She's got a lead on Diaz.

40:36.165 --> 40:37.715
She's close to getting him.

40:41.335 --> 40:42.845
That's good news, right?

40:47.125 --> 40:51.675
Well, all this saving
of your husband crap has...

Well, it's made me very hungry,

40:53.135 --> 40:54.515
so I'm gonna go get a pizza.

- Ok.
- If you...

40:56.925 --> 40:58.855
Want to come or if you're hungry.

40:58.925 --> 41:00.645
I don't know.

No.
