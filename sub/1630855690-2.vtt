WEBVTT

00:16.976 --> 00:18.978
Be careful out there!

00:20.354 --> 00:22.231
You all good?

00:22.231 --> 00:23.858
You've got me.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.111
-  Have fun.
-  Bye, Mum.

00:30.114 --> 00:32.324
Let's go. Woo-hoo-hoo!

00:49.175 --> 00:50.718
Whoo!

00:56.223 --> 00:57.683
Alice.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.503
Let's get you up, and into the shower.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.339
There you go, my dear.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.806
These might fit you.

01:36.806 --> 01:39.433
I, uh, found Candy's old boots,

01:39.433 --> 01:42.645
extra pair of socks,
just in case they're too big.

02:32.111 --> 02:36.115
It's going to be good to have a child
on the farm again, don't you think?

02:36.115 --> 02:37.533
Is it?

02:37.533 --> 02:39.618
Or are we going to
screw this one up as well?

02:41.161 --> 02:44.039
You're the one who
always tells the flowers

02:44.039 --> 02:46.792
every day is a chance to start over.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.169
Alice deserves that, and we do too.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
Do you think we should
put Agnes's room back?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.094
A few of her books, clothes?

02:58.512 --> 03:00.306
Let's not do that.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.100
She doesn't even know Agnes was here.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.948
- Wow, look at you.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.934
Let's go meet the flowers.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.815
Alice, this is Stella...

03:53.609 --> 03:56.111
...and Myf.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.447
Nice to meet you, Alice.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.783
May is our second-in-command.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.912
And this is our Rosie.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.914
And this is lovely Vlinda.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.042
And finally,
the one and only Boo.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.883
At last, I finally get to meet you.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.012
I'm Candy. Candy Blue.

04:27.768 --> 04:31.313
Alice is my granddaughter,

04:31.313 --> 04:34.316
and she will be living with us
from now on.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.568
Let's eat.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.904
I'd like to make a toast.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.572
Please?

04:48.664 --> 04:50.207
To Alice.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.625
Welcome to Thornfield,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.211
where wildflowers are allowed to bloom.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.674
To Alice.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.437
These are our cutting fields.

05:11.437 --> 05:14.148
They run all the way down
to the beehives,

05:14.148 --> 05:17.109
and back over to the river.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.486
And all of it is Thornfield.

05:19.486 --> 05:23.866
It was started by
your great-great grandmother Ruth,

05:23.866 --> 05:28.871
and it was handed down through
three generations of Thornfield women.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.540
Maybe one day it will be yours.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.941
These are ready for cutting.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.986
When I cut, I cut at the base,

06:00.986 --> 06:05.199
so when they grow through,
we'll have nice tall stems.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.746
People say they look like kangaroo paws,

06:10.746 --> 06:14.291
but I think they're like
bursting fire pods.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.045
Like bursting fire pods.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.757
Do you want to get the next one?

06:21.757 --> 06:23.634
Yeah. Guess what.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.099
They feel a bit like that too.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.530
Did Agnes say
why she wanted the will amended?

06:44.530 --> 06:47.658
She wanted to include
her unborn child in the will.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.784
Her son.

06:50.828 --> 06:53.664
She just... She must have felt
she was in danger.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.875
Yes, I gathered it was unsafe for her
to call from home,

06:56.875 --> 06:59.002
so she was calling from pay phones,

06:59.002 --> 07:01.505
trying to fax documents
to a post office.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.841
Poor Agnes. Jesus.

07:05.217 --> 07:08.428
Did Agnes say why she'd named
these two people guardians?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.723
I'm only asking
because she barely knew my wife,

07:11.723 --> 07:14.810
and June Hart also told me
she didn't know Agnes.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.271
Um, no.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.439
But we never really discussed that.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.943
Well, I'm going to have to
update the coroner,

07:22.943 --> 07:25.487
so I'll need copies of the will
sent to my office.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.614
Sorry, Mr Wheeler,

07:27.614 --> 07:29.366
what would it actually take

07:29.366 --> 07:32.578
for June to be declared unfit
to be Alice's guardian?

07:32.578 --> 07:37.332
Well, the main ones would be
health reasons,

07:37.332 --> 07:40.586
drug and alcohol dependence,

07:40.586 --> 07:42.379
a criminal record.

07:55.893 --> 07:59.271
Up here is where the human flowers live.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.566
- Back in a minute.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.660
Hey, girls.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.204
- Hey.
- Hey, June.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.499
- So, Stella, your sister called.
- Mm-hm.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.959
And Paddy's out of jail.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.836
He's looking for you.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.008
Um...

08:28.008 --> 08:31.094
Did... Did she tell him where I am?

08:31.094 --> 08:33.347
No. You're safe.

08:34.473 --> 08:37.059
I just wanted you
to be aware, vigilant.

08:37.059 --> 08:40.354
No calls out. Stick to the rules.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.155
Alice!

09:32.155 --> 09:35.617
You're not to come in here ever again,
do you understand?

09:35.617 --> 09:37.536
It's dangerous.

10:47.064 --> 10:50.108
So did your dad
ever tell you about Thornfield?

10:53.362 --> 10:56.198
So I'm guessing he never
told you about me either?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.828
Well, I'm your aunt.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.915
Not by birth.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.918
June and Twig found me by the river
and took me in.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.380
They'd taken Clem to the river to play,

11:11.380 --> 11:13.799
and they heard this sound
of a baby crying.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.884
And there in the reeds, in a basket,

11:15.884 --> 11:17.344
they found me,

11:17.344 --> 11:20.680
only hours old,
wrapped up in a blue evening gown.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.810
They looked high and low for my mother,
but they couldn't find her anywhere,

11:24.810 --> 11:26.478
so they took me in.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.897
And Twig named me Candy,

11:28.897 --> 11:31.441
after her fondness for sweets,

11:31.441 --> 11:33.985
and Blue, after the colour of the gown.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.543
Oh, I wish I could,
but I... I need to finish these,

11:49.543 --> 11:50.752
and then do deliveries.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.422
We can go tomorrow, OK?
It's alright.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.239
If I show you the path to the river,

12:19.239 --> 12:21.199
you have to promise me
you'll go straight there,

12:21.199 --> 12:23.493
take a look and come straight back.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.786
Promise?

13:27.557 --> 13:28.642
Daddy, you try.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.519
Alright. You're going to have to
help me, though.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.062
You teach me, yeah?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.899
One, two, three, four.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.025
- I'll get a photo, get a photo.
- OK.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.109
- I should show Mum.
- Yeah.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.986
- You good?
- Yeah, I am.

13:41.112 --> 13:44.157
Now, do the hula.
Do it again.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.243
Arms out. Look at that!

13:50.497 --> 13:51.581
Alice!

13:51.581 --> 13:52.958
Sorry.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.376
Come on.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.211
I'm trying.

13:56.211 --> 13:59.756
Now stand up, and do the hula, please.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.403
Alice...

14:29.578 --> 14:30.912
Alice...

15:24.758 --> 15:27.177
Are you OK?
I've got you, I've got you.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.684
Breathe in.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.061
And think 'in'.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.480
In...

15:38.480 --> 15:40.148
Out.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.525
- In...

15:42.525 --> 15:44.069
- Out.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.781
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.534
I... I have to do this for my mum.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.495
She has asthma.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.628
I'm Oggi.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.990
I used to live here
when my mum was a flower,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.493
but now I live in town behind the diner.

16:35.578 --> 16:39.207
I s...
I still like to come back to the river.

16:39.207 --> 16:43.128
Though, June might shoot me
if she ever catches me.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.089
I'm not kidding.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.799
You know she's got a shotgun.

16:59.853 --> 17:03.773
-  I think she's upstairs.
-  She's not upstairs, I checked.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.569
-  Candy.
-  I thought
she was with the flowers.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.404
She's not with the flowers.

17:09.404 --> 17:12.657
Did she just wander off?
Where did she go?

17:12.657 --> 17:16.035
She was helping me with
the pies, and then she went outside.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.495
You've said that. Where?

17:17.495 --> 17:20.999
I... I don't know.
To the fields, or with the flowers.

17:20.999 --> 17:24.711
She's not with the flowers!
You're scaring us now, Candy.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.213
Do you know where she is or not?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.340
-  I'm sorry.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.759
She's at the river.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.011
You let her go to the river
by herself?

17:33.011 --> 17:35.180
We don't even know if she can swim!

17:37.599 --> 17:38.933
Alice!

17:38.933 --> 17:41.436
- Alice...
- Alice, it's OK, baby girl.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.979
- It's OK.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.856
-  I'm not going to hurt you.
-  Shh...

17:44.856 --> 17:47.150
-  It's alright. It's OK.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.694
- Get a blanket.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.322
- Shh, shh...

17:57.160 --> 17:59.537
- It's OK.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.055
The lawyer faxed over
the files for the Coroner.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.265
Yeah.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.186
They sent Agnes's original will as well.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.446
Yep. Thanks, mate.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.920
I could vaguely come at why Agnes would
name you guardian four months ago,

19:30.920 --> 19:33.089
after you tried to help her.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.802
But two years ago?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.892
I thought you didn't even know her
back then.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.812
Uh, well, I... I didn't.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.899
She came to Gemma's funeral.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.817
But I didn't really know her.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.987
She brought us a... a plant.
She... She...

19:55.987 --> 19:57.906
She would come to the library sometimes,

19:57.906 --> 20:00.199
and... and we'd talk books.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.245
Later, she would talk to me about Alice,

20:04.245 --> 20:07.290
and I'd... I'd talk to her about Gemma.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.753
Hold on. So you knew what was going on
with Clem back then?

20:11.753 --> 20:14.839
No. No, no, I didn't know.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.758
I mean, there were... there were hints,

20:16.758 --> 20:19.552
but it wasn't till later that
I saw signs that he was hurting her,

20:19.552 --> 20:21.471
and then I told you.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.390
And then Alice turned up to the library,
and you know all the rest.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.808
Do I?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.270
I've been investigating this thing
for months, Sal,

20:29.270 --> 20:30.605
trying to put all the pieces together.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.524
Yeah, I know. I know. I'm sorry.
I didn't think it mattered.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.990
I didn't know she put me in her will.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.920
So did you get anything on June?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.464
A drink driving charge
from 12 years ago.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.970
I don't know. There's stuff
in her history, but it's... it's...

21:01.970 --> 21:03.680
complicated.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.599
- So you're not going to tell me now?
- Oh, jeez, Sal.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.851
You know I shouldn't have looked
in the first place.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.373
I spoke to Alice's nurse
at the hospital.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.501
She's had these sorts of
panic attacks before.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.713
And she put me on to a, um, Dr Harris.

21:36.713 --> 21:41.384
He felt Alice should be in therapy
for PTSD and anxiety.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.929
He also suggested drugs.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.016
For a nine-year-old?

22:19.922 --> 22:23.885
Oh, wow! You made this, Clem?

22:23.885 --> 22:25.762
You have a gift.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.463
Oggi, homework.
I'll be right back.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.548
I don't have any homework.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.862
- Hi.
-  Coffee. Please.

23:32.453 --> 23:36.082
Are you in for dinner,
or here to get drunk?

23:36.082 --> 23:38.960
Just making deliveries,
and then I'm heading home.

23:42.547 --> 23:45.633
Flowers and pies.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.177
Now, that is a winning combination.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.815
Where's the big man?

24:00.815 --> 24:03.401
The big man had a big day.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.444
You can say that again.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.453
Hey.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.665
I'm sorry things
didn't work out with Alice.

24:17.665 --> 24:20.918
But now you're in the will.
Maybe you've got a shot.

24:20.918 --> 24:24.547
Huh, yeah, well... gotta be a longshot.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.300
Custody battles can get very messy.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.260
Yeah, but...

24:29.260 --> 24:32.346
June's got a pretty interesting record.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.476
All those assaults.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.979
It's no wonder
Clem turned out the way he did.

24:43.024 --> 24:47.737
You didn't hear this from me,
but we had a call at the hospital.

24:47.737 --> 24:50.156
Alice had another one of
her panic attacks.

24:51.616 --> 24:53.492
Scared the hell out of them.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.462
- Calling it a night?
- Mm-hm.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.172
How about you?

25:09.717 --> 25:12.053
I used to have
a whole set of playing cards

25:12.053 --> 25:16.265
with girls on them who looked
just like you.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.433
Mmm.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.311
And I bet you played with them
all the time.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.188
No shame in that.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.648
Hmm.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.110
So where are you headed?

25:28.110 --> 25:31.030
Mmm... nowhere.

27:13.924 --> 27:19.263
Firewheel is "the colour of my fate".

27:19.263 --> 27:24.226
Emu bush is "my hidden worth".

27:24.226 --> 27:30.232
We mix it with some phragmite,
for "dangerous pleasures".

27:30.232 --> 27:34.653
And paper daisies mean...

27:34.653 --> 27:38.657
"by your love I live and die".

27:38.657 --> 27:44.038
The perfect wedding bouquet for
a marriage that's bound to end badly.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.166
Don't they all?

27:47.166 --> 27:50.836
Oh, for God's sake girl,
put on your lips.

27:51.879 --> 27:54.507
I can't tell who's talking without them.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.212
June Hart here.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.215
- June. It... It's Sally Morgan.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.175
I'm just...

28:38.175 --> 28:41.011
I'm calling to see how Alice is going.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.889
She's fine.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.850
Settling in.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.601
Asking lots of questions.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.019
Sh... Asking?

28:49.019 --> 28:51.480
Is she talking again?

28:51.480 --> 28:52.898
Yeah.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.778
Well, th... that's...

28:57.778 --> 29:00.239
that's amazing,
Alice is talking again.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.366
Hey.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.034
I... I was... I was just wondering...

29:05.369 --> 29:09.123
Has she had any more panic attacks
since she's been with you?

29:10.749 --> 29:13.377
No. Not that I'm aware of.

29:14.670 --> 29:19.425
Um, for the sake of transparency,
I want you to know the...

29:19.425 --> 29:22.011
the main reason that I'm calling.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.180
A solicitor has contacted us.

29:24.180 --> 29:28.851
And Agnes changed her will
before she died.

29:28.851 --> 29:32.813
She appointed me as...
as Alice's guardian,

29:32.813 --> 29:36.066
in... in... In the case that
y-you were deemed unfit to care for her.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.610
Sal. Sal.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.822
Unfit? What are you saying?

29:41.822 --> 29:44.074
I'm saying that you should know that
I'm talking to the lawyer,

29:44.074 --> 29:47.536
and I am taking steps...
to get custody of Alice.

29:47.536 --> 29:48.913
Please, Sal...

29:48.913 --> 29:51.165
Would you...
Could I please talk to Alice?

29:51.165 --> 29:53.000
I would like to hear her voice.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.543
- Sal!
- Wait!

29:55.920 --> 29:57.463
I mean... I was on the phone to her!

29:57.463 --> 29:59.173
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You just hung up on her!

29:59.173 --> 30:00.674
- What are you doing?
- What?

30:00.674 --> 30:03.177
I know for a fact that
Alice is having panic attacks.

30:03.177 --> 30:05.346
How... How could you possibly know that?

30:05.346 --> 30:07.515
- It doesn't matter how I know.
- It doesn't matter!

30:07.515 --> 30:09.308
It does matter, Sal,
you've just threatened her.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.852
- No, I haven't.
- You just threatened her.

30:11.852 --> 30:15.356
I said that I am taking steps
to get Alice back.

30:15.356 --> 30:18.067
Which is what I'm doing.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.152
With or without you.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.598
So, I wanted to give you this.

30:51.559 --> 30:55.813
It's the Thornfield Language Of Flowers.

30:58.732 --> 31:02.444
It was started by
your great-great grandmother, Ruth.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.865
And then every generation
has added to it.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.622
It's our very own secret language.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.292
Here.

31:17.376 --> 31:21.547
You pick out a flower,
something special to you.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.248
Wattle.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.960
"Always with you".

32:40.000 --> 32:41.669
No.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.412
June!

33:19.164 --> 33:21.083
June!

33:34.888 --> 33:37.307
It's from Paddy.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.184
It was by the door.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.984
They're our wedding rings,

33:46.984 --> 33:49.862
from the night he beat me,
and I lost the baby.

33:51.488 --> 33:54.575
His, and, um...

33:54.575 --> 33:57.286
the one he cut off my fucking finger.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.542
You said you'd keep me safe.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.297
- Please...
- I will.

34:12.009 --> 34:15.554
If we move Stella,
we're just putting her in more danger.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.183
And that's what he wants: to scare her.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.643
- But out there, we can't protect her.
- Yeah.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.937
But if that Sally bitch
gets a whiff of this,

34:23.937 --> 34:25.522
they're going to take Alice
away from us.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.649
That's not going to happen.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.277
I'm going to find this fucker
and get rid of him.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.988
- There he is.
- Hmm.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.908
Can't believe he got parole.

35:19.243 --> 35:21.328
I think I saw him at the diner.

35:23.413 --> 35:25.707
You think you did or you did?

35:25.707 --> 35:27.334
I think I did.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.264
- Let's send it through to Esther.
- Yep.

36:05.038 --> 36:08.709
I can try him on the radio.
He's out at the Hart property.

36:08.709 --> 36:11.420
Just let him know I came by.

36:11.420 --> 36:14.715
I chatted to a cop I know,
about June Hart.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.343
Oh, yeah.
What did he have to say?

36:18.343 --> 36:20.095
Well, for starters,
there's definitely no love lost

36:20.095 --> 36:21.930
between June and the police.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.725
She won't let them on her property
without a warrant.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.394
The locals out there think
the farm's some sort of lesbian cult.

36:29.271 --> 36:30.814
I went online.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.483
It's four hours inland, no website.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.902
It's not on any maps.

36:34.902 --> 36:37.195
There's just a PO Box
and a number you can contact

36:37.195 --> 36:39.114
from the flower markets in the city.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.741
That's it.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.953
Look at you, big detective.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.122
Thank you, I... I appreciate it.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.083
Sal.

36:51.835 --> 36:55.756
My mate did say he'd be happy to...
keep an eye out for her...

36:55.756 --> 36:57.382
apply a bit of pressure on June.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.052
Only if you wanted.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.201
Fuck!

38:14.292 --> 38:16.503
So why can't she speak?

38:18.588 --> 38:21.049
Ah, she was in a fire.

38:21.049 --> 38:24.594
It burned down her house
and took away her voice.

38:24.594 --> 38:25.929
Where does she live now?

38:28.682 --> 38:32.185
S-she lives on a wildflower farm.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.063
Should have guessed she was
one of those Thornfield retards.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.314
Here we go.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.777
So, is your mother a junkie,
a whore, or a lesbian,

38:40.777 --> 38:42.863
like Oggi.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.953
- Ooh!

38:49.953 --> 38:51.955
-  Oh!

38:55.917 --> 38:58.712
Fight, fight, fight!

40:10.659 --> 40:12.953
Afternoon, June.

40:12.953 --> 40:14.913
Why did you pull me over?

40:16.248 --> 40:18.708
Random breath test.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.544
Had anything to drink today, June?

40:20.544 --> 40:22.462
For fuck's sake.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.134
- June, I was about to call you.
- Were you?

40:27.134 --> 40:30.262
To see how your harassment's going?

40:30.262 --> 40:32.764
Ah, I'm not sure I follow.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.975
You trying to be funny, Sergeant?

40:34.975 --> 40:38.687
Yeah, I wasn't sure what your crazy wife
was up to the other day.

40:38.687 --> 40:42.023
But getting the local cops in
to intimidate me...

40:43.066 --> 40:44.985
I don't scare easy.

40:44.985 --> 40:47.654
- And I sure as hell know my rights.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.824
So you better call off your boys,

40:50.824 --> 40:53.160
or I'll have you all
done for harassment.

41:07.299 --> 41:08.842
Mum.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.974
She...
She said it was a terrible accident.

41:26.776 --> 41:29.905
Mr Chandler, so sorry
that this has happened.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.115
And thank you again
for being so understanding.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.451
Alice, come on, sweetheart.

41:34.451 --> 41:36.369
Off we go. See you later, Oggi.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.663
Thank you. See you again.

41:39.915 --> 41:42.042
See you tomorrow, Alice.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.687
So what are they calling us
these days?

42:04.522 --> 42:07.275
Are we witches?

42:07.275 --> 42:09.027
Are we drug addicts?

42:10.237 --> 42:11.905
Lesbians?

42:17.869 --> 42:22.540
Some people in this town don't like
the idea of women running a farm.

42:23.750 --> 42:26.920
And they don't like that
we keep to ourselves,

42:26.920 --> 42:29.923
and that we're different.

42:29.923 --> 42:31.675
It scares them.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.472
But I'll tell you a secret.

42:38.640 --> 42:43.061
Their fear gives us
a certain power over them.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.232
That and the fact that they're idiots.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.576
Good timing.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.247
I... I've printed out a... a draft
of the court papers

43:02.247 --> 43:03.748
for you to go over.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.750
What the fuck were you thinking?

43:06.710 --> 43:09.421
Going behind my back to Chef,
of all fucking people.

43:09.421 --> 43:12.132
Getting his mates to
apply pressure to June.

43:14.050 --> 43:15.468
Huh?

43:16.678 --> 43:19.222
Well, you can forget this,

43:19.222 --> 43:20.682
'cause June will be
well within her rights

43:20.682 --> 43:23.476
to sue us and the entire fucking
police department for harassment.

43:23.476 --> 43:27.355
I didn't want to go behind your back,
really, I... I didn't.

43:27.355 --> 43:30.358
But then I found out that...

43:30.358 --> 43:33.028
you weren't telling me everything
about June's record.

43:33.028 --> 43:34.904
I told you she had a drink driving
charge from 12 years ago!

43:34.904 --> 43:38.491
Yes, you did tell me that, but you
didn't tell me about the assaults.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.702
I didn't tell you about
the assaults, Sal,

43:40.702 --> 43:43.580
because June has been the victim
in every one of them.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.160
Thanks, Esther.

44:29.542 --> 44:32.545
You look like you could use another.

44:32.545 --> 44:33.838
No, I'm fine, thanks.

44:33.838 --> 44:36.591
Oh, let me buy you a drink.

44:36.591 --> 44:38.009
Esther.

44:45.934 --> 44:48.728
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

44:58.530 --> 45:01.116
- I don't want another.
- Oh...

45:01.116 --> 45:02.784
I hate to drink alone.

45:05.245 --> 45:08.915
Look, I don't want to be rude,
but I'm not interested.

45:14.003 --> 45:16.756
No, I'm sure you'd be
much more interested

45:16.756 --> 45:20.427
in, uh... someone much younger,

45:20.427 --> 45:22.929
nicely put together,

45:22.929 --> 45:24.681
spunky...

45:24.681 --> 45:28.184
...bright red lipstick.

45:32.021 --> 45:33.731
Who the fuck are you?

45:35.150 --> 45:36.693
Esther.

45:36.693 --> 45:40.488
I don't want a drink, not from you.

45:41.656 --> 45:45.285
Now, you stay the fuck away from me,
or I'll fucking...

45:45.285 --> 45:47.120
Or what?

45:48.329 --> 45:49.831
You gonna hit me?

45:52.917 --> 45:56.838
You...

45:56.838 --> 45:59.132
You fucking pussy.

46:00.800 --> 46:03.052
Oh, that's right.

46:03.052 --> 46:07.599
You only like to...
beat up on young girls,

46:07.599 --> 46:10.602
young, pregnant girls,
even better.

46:21.863 --> 46:23.531
Come on.

46:28.912 --> 46:30.497
Coward.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.126
I'm not falling for it.

46:40.757 --> 46:43.968
I... I get the guilt, yeah?

46:45.178 --> 46:47.722
And I get...

46:47.722 --> 46:49.307
that you miss our daughter.

46:49.307 --> 46:50.934
I do too.

46:53.394 --> 46:56.523
- I said I was sorry.
- Oh, stop saying that!

46:56.523 --> 47:00.568
I don't want "sorry".
I... I want you to talk to me, Sal.

47:00.568 --> 47:04.739
Just talk to me. Please.

47:07.075 --> 47:08.785
Just tell me the truth.

47:56.457 --> 47:58.001
Come on.

48:01.629 --> 48:04.215
Agh!

48:10.096 --> 48:11.639
Oi!

50:41.205 --> 50:43.291
The things you do.

50:45.251 --> 50:47.754
I got him, though.

50:47.754 --> 50:49.797
- Ow!
- Sorry.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.723
- Ow!
- Is that better?

50:58.723 --> 51:01.434
Don't make me laugh.

51:01.434 --> 51:03.478
Sorry.

51:31.631 --> 51:33.174
Rosie.

51:47.730 --> 51:49.398
Thank you.

52:05.373 --> 52:07.792
It's not as bad as it looks.

52:07.792 --> 52:10.169
I decided to clean out
the damn greenhouse

52:10.169 --> 52:13.589
and got whacked in the face
with a falling branch.

52:25.393 --> 52:26.853
Sal?

52:41.951 --> 52:43.369
What is this?

53:03.639 --> 53:05.391
That's not Alice, is it?

53:31.208 --> 53:33.586
Why was Clem Hart carving our daughter?

53:44.847 --> 53:46.807
I need you to say it, Sal.

53:49.685 --> 53:51.479
I need you to say it.

53:54.899 --> 53:56.692
Say it!

54:01.238 --> 54:04.158
S-she... She was his.

54:08.079 --> 54:10.081
Gemma was his.

54:14.126 --> 54:15.878
No...

55:14.603 --> 55:16.063
"Dear Agnes,

55:16.063 --> 55:18.274
"This story reminds me of you,

55:18.274 --> 55:21.444
"how being around you
makes me feel I'm falling,

55:21.444 --> 55:23.612
"but in the most wonderful way.

55:24.905 --> 55:27.992
"Since you arrived at Thornfield,
my life has changed.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.495
