00:03.351 --> 00:05.135
ANNOUNCER: It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:07.181 --> 00:10.967
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FXX.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.233
FX presents Mr. InBetween.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.204
Uh, so my name's Ray.

00:30.247 --> 00:33.076
I'm, uh, Brittany's dad.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.080
Um... :I work in the security industry.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.952
So, basically,
I work in a club.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.216
And, um...

00:42.259 --> 00:44.131
you know, my job
is to kind of make sure

00:44.174 --> 00:46.698
that people behave themselves

00:46.742 --> 00:49.179
while they're in the...
in the club.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.964
Yeah, love?

00:52.008 --> 00:54.489
Are you a bouncer?

00:54.532 --> 00:56.360
Uh... Mm.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.710
Yeah, there's a bit more to it
than that,

00:58.754 --> 01:00.495
but, yeah, basically, um,

01:00.538 --> 01:01.974
yeah, I'm a bouncer.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.367
Yeah, man?

01:03.411 --> 01:04.977
You're pretty small
for a bouncer.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.458
Yeah, I guess, but, um,

01:07.502 --> 01:09.982
it's not the size of the dog
in the fight, mate.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.462
What does that mean?

01:11.506 --> 01:13.116
Well, it's not the size
of the dog in the fight,

01:13.160 --> 01:15.597
it's the size of the fight
in the dog.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.382
I don't get it.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.080
Um...

01:21.646 --> 01:24.519
Well, in a fight, what matters
is how much heart you've got.

01:24.562 --> 01:27.174
That's kind of what decides
a fight.

01:27.217 --> 01:28.784
-Yeah, man?
-Do you think you could beat

01:28.827 --> 01:30.264
my dad in a fight?

01:30.307 --> 01:33.354
Well, I've never met him,
but, um, I'd...

01:33.397 --> 01:35.225
I'd say...

01:35.269 --> 01:38.794
-probably not.
-What about Conor McGregor?

01:38.837 --> 01:42.014
Uh, uh, definitely, definitely
couldn't beat Conor McGregor.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.015
Yeah, love?

01:43.059 --> 01:44.669
Is your job dangerous?

01:47.281 --> 01:49.239
Um...

01:49.283 --> 01:51.198
No. Not really, no.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.851
I wouldn't say it was.
Yeah, mate?

01:52.895 --> 01:54.331
Have you ever killed anybody?

01:54.375 --> 01:56.377
Uh, once.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.205
Really?
What happened?

01:58.248 --> 02:00.381
Uh, this kid was asking me
too many questions.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.734
I'm just kidding, mate.
I'm just kidding.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.129
Uh, okay, man.

02:21.228 --> 02:24.448
What, no socks went out
of fashion, did they, mate?

02:24.492 --> 02:27.321
Your mate beat the shit out
of old Stan last night.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.322
Dirk?

02:28.365 --> 02:30.672
Yeah.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.239
What happened?

02:32.282 --> 02:34.589
Stan was getting flirty
with Giselle.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.634
You know,
nothing out of the usual.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.332
-Mm.
-Your mate comes in

02:38.375 --> 02:39.768
like a bull at a gate,

02:39.811 --> 02:41.335
starts getting rough.

02:41.378 --> 02:44.033
Stan said something--
I don't know what.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.253
Next second, old Stan's
laying on the ground,

02:46.296 --> 02:48.080
getting his head stomped on.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.995
Is he all right?

02:50.039 --> 02:51.258
No, he's not all right.

02:51.301 --> 02:54.348
I had to get Mandy
to take him to the hospital.

02:54.391 --> 02:57.481
Now, I know he's your mate
and all, but he's got to go.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.222
Mm.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.454
DIRK:
Hello?

03:13.497 --> 03:15.195
It's me.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.023
Hi, mate.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.024
How you doing?

03:19.068 --> 03:20.243
Eh.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.244
Feeling all right?

03:21.288 --> 03:23.681
Yes, pretty much.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.036
Not a bad joint.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.473
Yeah, it's...

03:33.952 --> 03:36.041
...all I can bloody afford,
isn't it?

03:36.085 --> 03:37.478
You want a drink or something,
mate?

03:37.521 --> 03:40.089
A sandwich?
Some pharmaceuticals?

03:41.090 --> 03:42.047
Nah, I'm good.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.880
So you beat the shit
out of old Stan, eh?

03:51.927 --> 03:55.409
-Yeah.
-Ooh.

03:55.452 --> 03:58.760
He was getting pretty handsy
with, um, Giselle.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.109
Mm.

04:00.152 --> 04:03.199
-As usual.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.767
Dirty old bugger.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.769
Well...

04:09.510 --> 04:11.163
Got to fire you.

04:14.471 --> 04:15.864
Oh, mate.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.344
I'll leave you to it,
all right?

04:17.387 --> 04:18.823
Ray.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.435
Ray.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.914
Yeah?

04:23.959 --> 04:25.787
I don't want your money, mate.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.972
KATE:
Do you think--

04:37.015 --> 04:38.539
how do I put this--
do you think

04:38.582 --> 04:41.237
there is a difference
in the act of killing

04:41.281 --> 04:43.805
between when you were
in the Army

04:43.848 --> 04:45.415
and-and what you do now?

04:45.459 --> 04:47.722
Does-does it feel any different?

04:49.724 --> 04:51.595
No.

04:51.639 --> 04:52.814
No difference at all?

04:52.857 --> 04:56.165
No, killing's killing.
Mm.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.820
You know, you get medals in theArmy for when you kill people,

04:58.863 --> 05:00.387
but, you know,
I don't get those anymore,

05:00.430 --> 05:01.910
-but, you know...
-Yeah.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.216
I can't imagine
hit men get medals.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.740
Nah.We get paid better though, so...

05:05.783 --> 05:09.396
Yeah? No one tells you
what to do now.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.746
Yeah. You know,if I want to do a job, I do it.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.487
If I don't want to do a job,
I don't.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.010
You know, I can say no.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.621
-Yes or no.
-Mm.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.450
Do you ever feel sorry
for any of your victims?

05:23.975 --> 05:25.586
Not really, no.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.457
-Never?

05:27.501 --> 05:29.590
Why would I?

05:29.633 --> 05:31.069
Well, what about their families?

05:32.114 --> 05:33.245
What about 'em?

05:33.289 --> 05:34.421
Well, doesn't it
ever bother you--

05:34.464 --> 05:36.423
you know, the pain
that you're causing

05:36.466 --> 05:39.513
the loved ones that are
left behind, grieving for...

05:39.556 --> 05:41.384
for the person
that you've just murdered?

05:49.218 --> 05:51.394
You know, I killed people when
I was in the Army, you know?

05:51.438 --> 05:52.482
Nobody, you know...

05:52.526 --> 05:54.049
They had families, so...

05:54.092 --> 05:55.398
Yeah, sure, but I think...

05:55.442 --> 05:57.269
you know, I think
the difference is choice.

05:57.313 --> 06:00.403
When you're in the Army,
you-you don't have a choice.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.492
But here, you-you do.
You've got a choice.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.059
-You don't actually have
to do this job.
-No, no, no,

06:04.102 --> 06:05.626
-no, no, no, no, no.
-You could...
I mean, you could choose

06:05.669 --> 06:07.410
-to do something different.
-No, no, no, no.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.239
I chose to join the Army.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.067
You know, I could say, like,
somebody put a gun to my head

06:12.110 --> 06:14.591
and said you got to join
the army or, you know...

06:14.635 --> 06:16.419
I had a choice. That's-that's
what I decided to do.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.899
I was gonna go over there
and fucking kill people,

06:17.942 --> 06:19.030
-so...
-Yeah, okay.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.467
You got no problem with that.

06:20.510 --> 06:23.470
-Okay.
-As soon as I come back here

06:23.513 --> 06:25.297
and I start
doing the same thing,

06:25.341 --> 06:26.429
suddenly you're all, fucking,

06:26.473 --> 06:28.300
I don't know,
"high and mighty" about it.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.693
Like, you know...

06:29.737 --> 06:32.522
like I should feel bad about itor something.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.785
-Should I feel bad about it?
-Uh,

06:34.829 --> 06:36.657
I'm-I'm just asking a question.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.659
Yeah, you're asking
some questions.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.661
Yeah. It's the questions
you're asking,

06:40.704 --> 06:42.924
-you know what I mean?
-Well, okay, well, so,

06:42.967 --> 06:44.926
what about...
what about your daughter?

06:44.969 --> 06:47.450
I mean, you-you know,
from what you've told me,

06:47.494 --> 06:50.235
you really love her.
I'm sure she loves you.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.889
Surely she'd be really,
you know, devastated

06:51.933 --> 06:53.935
if something happened to you.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.513
-Hey, my friend.
-Hi.

07:06.556 --> 07:09.559
Get that one and a pack
of John Kelsey's, friend.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.306
Money, champ.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.315
Thanks, mate.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.414
Could've just had
one of these, prez.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.894
No, I don't smoke that.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.896
What's wrong with them?

07:41.939 --> 07:44.507
It's all the chemicals, mate.
It tastes like shit.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.252
Oi.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.299
What, are you stalking me, mate?

07:54.343 --> 07:57.302
-Hey? How are you?
-Hey, good.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.956
What you doing...
What the fuck?! Jesus.

08:01.785 --> 08:02.873
Get him!

08:02.917 --> 08:05.136
Hold him, hold him, hold him.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.399
-Got him.
-Hold him.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.966
-VINNIE: Kev!
-I got him.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.577
-VINNIE: Kev!

08:10.620 --> 08:12.535
RAY:
I got him. Got him.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.232
VINNIE:
Kev!

08:14.276 --> 08:15.669
I got you.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.584
RAY:
Good? Let's get out of here.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.150
Let's go, mate.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.196
-VINNIE: Kev!

08:40.607 --> 08:42.696
So who's paying you?

08:42.739 --> 08:45.220
Your VP.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.179
Alex?

08:48.223 --> 08:50.007
Mm-hmm.

08:52.053 --> 08:55.056
Jesus. Fuck.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.543
Uh, you got a smoke?

09:04.892 --> 09:05.632
Quit.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.634
You quit?

09:07.677 --> 09:10.201
Good for you, mate.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.726
I got some rollies in me pocket.

09:12.769 --> 09:13.857
You good I get 'em out?

09:13.901 --> 09:15.293
Hey, go for it.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.043
They paying you all right?

09:26.087 --> 09:28.611
Yeah.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.700
Mind me asking how much?

09:33.007 --> 09:35.009
-$250.
-Fuck.

09:36.706 --> 09:37.620
Jesus.
Yeah, well, you're good.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.100
I'll give you that.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.058
I never saw it coming.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.453
Nothing personal.

09:44.496 --> 09:45.802
Yeah, I know.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.978
I'm surprised
I've fucking lived this long,

09:48.022 --> 09:50.154
-to tell you the truth.
-Mm.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.681
I'm guessing if I was to try
and buy you out,

09:54.724 --> 09:56.813
you'd just pocket the cash
and kill me anyway.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.556
Still got to get your $250.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
-Mm-hmm.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.010
It was weird, but...

10:20.054 --> 10:23.013
I mean, I'd never
shot any bloke before that.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.667
And it's not like it is
in the movies, right?

10:24.711 --> 10:26.713
-It's different.
-Mm.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.540
And this fellow, I remember,

10:28.584 --> 10:31.805
his legs went all sort of wobbly

10:31.848 --> 10:33.807
and sat down on the floor.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.026
He just looked
real fucking tired,

10:36.070 --> 10:38.333
you know.
Just real tired.

10:38.376 --> 10:39.813
He looked up at me, you know.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.772
He sort of looked me
right in the eye.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.340
Just said, "Fuck, mate."

10:45.383 --> 10:46.907
Then he just...

10:46.950 --> 10:49.300
That was it.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.346
Lights went out of his eyes.

10:54.305 --> 10:58.222
20 years, and that blokestill comes to me in my dreams.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.704
Every time I see him, he just...

11:01.748 --> 11:03.837
looks at me with this look,
you know.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.708
That same look.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.102
Doesn't say anything, just...

11:08.145 --> 11:09.886
just looks at me.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.410
Scares the shit out of me.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.374
You don't get that?

11:21.419 --> 11:24.422
Blokes you've knocked
come to you in your dreams?

11:25.989 --> 11:27.382
Sometimes.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.384
Doesn't bother you?

11:32.561 --> 11:34.215
Bothers the shit out of me.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.958
Not enough to make you
want to quit, though.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.746
Every job's got
its downside, man.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.635
Come on, mate.

12:03.679 --> 12:04.898
Right, eh?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.813
Let him go, man.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.911
- Keep an eye out.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.956
Cool.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.691
Top spot.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.781
Yeah.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.527
I'll see you in your dreams.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.107
Yeah?

14:24.951 --> 14:26.778
Ooh.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.522
So what happened?

14:31.566 --> 14:34.047
I was asleep upstairs, woke up.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.745
Saw a light,
uh, spinning around.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.139
-Mm.-Got up, went to the money room.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.489
Got clocked as soon as I walkedin the fucking door.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.012
Did you get a look at him?

14:43.056 --> 14:45.014
Nah.
It was too fucking dark.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.929
What about the CCTV?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.931
Yeah, I got about 30 seconds
of the prick.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.063
-Mm.
-He got in back here.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.892
-Yeah.
-Knew what he was doing.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.549
How much did he get?

14:58.593 --> 15:02.118
FREDDY:
The night's takings.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.558
It's Dirk.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.957
Fucking little...

15:18.091 --> 15:20.049
I give the guy a job.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.095
I treat him like a fucking...

15:23.009 --> 15:24.532
Shit.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.229
I know he's your mate and all,

15:26.273 --> 15:27.970
but I want him gone.

15:32.061 --> 15:35.021
-What do you mean, gone?
-I mean gone-gone.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.370
I'm not gonna whack him.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.938
Yeah, well,
I'll find somebody who will.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.525
Oh!

16:46.527 --> 16:48.181
Bloody hell, Ray.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.704
Wakey, wakey.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.229
What's going on?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.101
Need a favor.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.667
What?

16:56.711 --> 16:58.713

17:19.473 --> 17:21.257
Mm.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.657
Smoke, Ray?

17:29.700 --> 17:31.180
Nah, I quit.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.442
-What?
-Mm.

17:32.486 --> 17:33.530
When?

17:33.574 --> 17:35.184
About a month ago.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.186
Cold turkey?

17:37.230 --> 17:39.971
Yeah, I started cold turkey,
but...

17:40.015 --> 17:42.496
I was just getting too
fucking angry all of a sudden.

17:42.539 --> 17:45.151
-I had to get
on the fucking patches.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.328
-That work?
-Yeah, they do.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.720
You start off...

17:49.764 --> 17:52.332
Like, you start off
with the strong... ones.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.985
-Mm.
-And then, like, you have them

17:54.029 --> 17:56.466
for a week,
and then you go to the next,

17:56.510 --> 17:58.338
-you know, less strong,
-Yeah.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.035
-less strong week by week.
-Yeah.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.820
And, yeah-- eventually...
you know, got off 'em.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.953
-Wow.
-You thinking of quitting,
are you?

18:04.996 --> 18:06.998
No. God, no.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.239
It's fresh.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.461
It's romantic.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.130
What's going on, Ray?

19:01.488 --> 19:03.446
You got to leave town, mate.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.753
What?

19:05.796 --> 19:08.277
I know you ripped Freddy off.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.977
You got to go, mate.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.850
You got to go today,
and you can't ever come back.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.034
-Yeah. Nah, fuck that.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.827
You got to go.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.875
Or what?

19:42.137 --> 19:44.139
Are you gonna shoot me?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.186
Do it.

20:00.721 --> 20:03.463
You remember when I killed
that kid in Uyghur prov?

20:07.380 --> 20:08.555
Mm.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.734
That was it for me.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.869
It's like...

20:20.436 --> 20:23.352
...my life had promise,

20:23.396 --> 20:24.527
you know?

20:24.571 --> 20:27.008
Had a... spark.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.364
Then, after that, just...

20:45.156 --> 20:47.158
Mate, pick a spot.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.292
Anywhere.

20:52.512 --> 20:55.297
-Anywhere you want to go,
you know?
-Mm.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.170

20:59.214 --> 21:00.346
I'll set you up.

21:00.389 --> 21:03.653
You know, get you on your feet.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.699
Okay.

21:38.035 --> 21:40.299
Hey, sorry about
all that shit with Freddy.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.867
Forget it.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.743
Come on.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.398

21:54.095 --> 21:56.053
