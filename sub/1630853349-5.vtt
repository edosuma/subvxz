00:41.600 --> 00:44.680
<i>Our flight to The Meadows today</i>
<i>will last eight hours.</i>

00:44.760 --> 00:45.760
-Drinky-poo!
-Yes!

00:45.840 --> 00:46.760
Let's do it!

01:00.800 --> 01:01.640
Ooh!

01:01.720 --> 01:06.080
Goddamn,
motherfucker bitches!

01:08.120 --> 01:09.280
It's gonna be a party.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.880
Ken.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.240
What business do you think I'm in?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.760
Fitness instructor?

01:36.680 --> 01:37.560
Uh-uh.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.640
I'm in the Skip Cho business,
motherfucker,

01:43.080 --> 01:46.200
and that's whatever the fuck
makes me another billion.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.320
You like that? You like that? You like it?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.440
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.640
I'm really sorry.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.600
You're coming with us to The Meadows,

02:03.440 --> 02:05.280
whether you like it or not.

02:11.800 --> 02:17.040
<i>Orange alert! Orange alert! Orange alert!</i>

02:17.120 --> 02:22.560
<i>Orange alert! Orange alert! Orange alert!</i>

02:22.640 --> 02:25.600
<i>Orange alert! Orange alert!</i>

02:25.680 --> 02:29.760
<i>Alert! All Pentaverate personnel</i>
<i>report to post!</i>

02:29.840 --> 02:31.400
<i>I'm Maria Menounos.</i>

02:32.800 --> 02:35.640
Okay, gentlemen, listen up,
approximately 60 minutes ago,

02:35.720 --> 02:38.680
a Tabloid Group jet
left New York for The Meadows.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.000
Fimbra intelligence tells us
that Bruce Baldwin, Skip Cho,

02:42.080 --> 02:44.520
and the prisoner Ken Scarborough
are on board.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.840
-Where are the Red Robes?
-Gone like thieves in the night.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.600
Can we cancel The Meadows?
I mean, I can't get through.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.760
Outside communications have been severed,
and the guests are already arriving.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.080
We were beaten like rented mules.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.560
I don't like
this "beaten like rented mule."

02:57.640 --> 03:00.280
First of all,
you should not beat a rented animal.

03:00.360 --> 03:04.680
It is clear violation of rental agreement,
and you would lose deposit.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.600
Thank you, Mishu.
Did they take their keys with them?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.800
Yes, and they took the Parce Clavem.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.240
Balls.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.240
With three keys,
they can literally vote on anything.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.040
Gentlemen, we have three keys.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.520
I put forth motion
to enact the Demetrius Protocols.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.560
-Seconded.
-Observed, sadly.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.960
Let's take a vote.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.840
Patty, where's the Da Vinci lock?

03:40.920 --> 03:44.720
Before you get mad at me,
I sent you a memo about this.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.800
<i>Bruce had me send the Da Vinci lock</i>
<i>to The Meadows ahead of schedule.</i>

03:49.800 --> 03:52.880
All this time, we were focused
on the keys like schmucks,

03:52.960 --> 03:54.880
and then Bruce steals the lock.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
Kind of genius. Kind of genius.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.680
Who knows what they're up to.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.000
Well, not to say I told you so,

04:00.080 --> 04:03.680
but I knew it was a bad idea admitting
Bruce Baldwin into the Pentaverate Five.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.200
Nobody listened!

04:05.280 --> 04:07.960
You should have gone
with my suggestion of Ethan Hawking!

04:08.040 --> 04:10.120
-Who?
-Ethan Hawking.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.080
The smart guy in the wheelchair
who wrote the book about time.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.520
You mean Stephen Hawking?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.960
Yeah. What… what did I say?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.960
Uh, how much time do we have?

04:19.040 --> 04:21.480
Well, uh, Bruce should land
in about seven hours.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.760
If you left right now on the Musk,
you could beat him.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.760
-MENTOR!

04:26.840 --> 04:28.800
Prepare the Musk for departure.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.520
<i> No can do, Patty-cakes.</i>

04:31.320 --> 04:34.640
<i>Bruce set malware in my motherboard</i>
<i>to lock the wheels of the Musk.</i>

04:35.920 --> 04:38.320
<i>One of you skeezers</i>
<i>has to go into my mainframe</i>

04:38.400 --> 04:40.560
<i>and manually override this shit.</i>

04:40.640 --> 04:43.840
The world's most powerful computer,
and you can't unlock the fucking wheels?

04:43.920 --> 04:46.200
<i>It's manual override, asswipe.</i>

04:46.280 --> 04:49.880
<i>Last time I checked, I don't have hands.</i>

04:49.960 --> 04:54.320
Patty, how do you suggest we proceed?

04:54.400 --> 04:57.320
Well, I'm just an assistant.
I don't make those kind of decisions.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.920
No one knows this organization
better than you.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.360
Well, I do have a few ideas.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.920
If I remember my thermodynamics correctly,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
increasing MENTOR'S temperature
will cause a temporary reset,

05:11.080 --> 05:14.240
which should be enough time
to override Bruce's malware.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.440
Mishu, try to restore communication
with Dubrovnik Central.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.760
-Got it.
-Shep, go man the control room.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.680
Copy, Patty.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.120
We have a solid 30-second window
to deactivate MENTOR'S mainframe

05:24.200 --> 05:26.120
and disengage the Musk brakes.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.520
Well-done, Patty.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.280
All right, people, places.
We must save the Pentaverate Five!

05:35.160 --> 05:38.360
<i> In 1948,</i>
<i>in Cowes on the Isle of Wight,</i>

05:38.440 --> 05:39.960
<i>a star was born,</i>

05:40.040 --> 05:44.400
<i>who would later turn out to be</i>
<i>Jeremy John Irons.</i>

05:44.480 --> 05:46.360
<i>He was classically trained</i>
<i>at the Bristol Old Vic</i>

05:46.440 --> 05:49.680
<i>and gained notoriety</i>
<i>for his many West End productions,</i>

05:49.760 --> 05:51.760
<i>although his greatest achievement was--</i>

05:52.400 --> 05:55.760
<i>What? Contractually,</i>
<i>I can only talk about the Pentaverate?</i>

05:55.840 --> 05:57.080
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

05:58.000 --> 06:01.560
<i>The Pentaverate. Secret society,</i>
<i>five men, claim to be nice.</i>

06:01.640 --> 06:03.840
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I really question the idea of nice,</i>

06:03.920 --> 06:05.840
<i>as they just piked poor Higgins.</i>

06:06.800 --> 06:08.840
<i>Oh God, I'm getting tired of this shit.</i>

06:16.320 --> 06:19.000
I've had tee too many martoonies.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.760
I'm getting slightly munted.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.360
Ah!

06:27.440 --> 06:29.600
Motherfucker bitches! Whoo!

06:29.680 --> 06:32.200
All right, then,
let's start at the beginning.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.840
<i>By the time I was 40,</i>

06:35.920 --> 06:39.000
<i>I'd built a media empire</i>
<i>on a global scale.</i>

06:39.080 --> 06:40.720
<i>The Tabloid Group.</i>

06:41.280 --> 06:44.920
<i>We told the people what to buy</i>
<i>and who to vote for.</i>

06:45.680 --> 06:50.360
I was the go-to guy when the powerful
needed to bring down an opponent.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.960
We appreciate your help, Brucey.
-You're welcome.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.280
I was the motherfucker
who created disinformation,

06:56.360 --> 06:58.680
and I had them eating out of my hands.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.360
-Ow!
Boundaries?

07:00.440 --> 07:01.720
What boundaries?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.040
Ow! Oh!

07:04.080 --> 07:05.080
Hey.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.320
-I was at the height of my career.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.720
Whoo! Goddamn!

07:11.800 --> 07:12.840
I love cocaine!

07:12.920 --> 07:14.600
Next thing you know, I'm in New York…

07:14.680 --> 07:17.000
<i>-…forced into the Pentaverate.</i>

07:17.840 --> 07:19.480
Who the fuck are you?

07:19.560 --> 07:21.880
-The Pentaverate.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.240
<i>Once I was in the Pentaverate…</i>

07:26.280 --> 07:29.600
<i>…the Colonel and I were able</i>
<i>to thwart the Millennium Bug.</i>

07:29.680 --> 07:31.000
<i>Y2K was real.</i>

07:31.080 --> 07:32.600
…bug had no bite.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.040
You're welcome.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.040
But then the Internet arrived.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.560
<i>I tried to warn the Pentaverate</i>

07:38.640 --> 07:42.320
<i>that the bad guys would use the Internet</i>
<i>the same way I used the tabloids,</i>

07:42.400 --> 07:44.240
<i>only a million times worse.</i>

07:46.720 --> 07:49.040
-Grenade!

07:49.120 --> 07:54.720
And when Jason Eccleston joined in 2014
and created the supercomputer MENTOR…

07:55.520 --> 07:57.280
<i>Where the fuck am I?</i>

07:57.360 --> 07:59.240
…I thought we'd be able
to beat the Internet

07:59.320 --> 08:02.800
by having a universal set
of agreed-upon facts.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.840
MENTOR uploads all the world's knowledge

08:05.920 --> 08:10.040
and calculates the probability
of the most accurate version of truth.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.240
<i>But instead we got</i>
<i>Internet clickbait conspiracy theories</i>

08:13.320 --> 08:16.280
<i>and other opiates for the idiot masses.</i>

08:16.360 --> 08:21.200
Rex Smith here. We're talking about
what's happening in Provo, Utah.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.480
There is a storage facility there.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.560
And that's where they're keeping
all the dog smiles.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.000
I thought people would be smart enough
to check facts, but no.

08:30.680 --> 08:34.280
<i>They're too addicted</i>
<i>to their smartphones and their tablets</i>

08:34.360 --> 08:37.680
<i>and blah, blah, blah, fuckity blah.</i>

08:37.760 --> 08:41.160
<i>"Oh, you'll never believe</i>
<i>what Phoebe Cates looks like now."</i>

08:41.240 --> 08:43.240
-She looks beautiful, by the way.
-Stunning.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.520
She's a lovely lady.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.480
What's the point of trying to help people

08:47.560 --> 08:50.120
when they don't even want
to help themselves?

08:50.840 --> 08:52.720
They don't deserve MENTOR.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.880
And guess what?

08:55.880 --> 08:57.240
They're not gonna get it.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.440
-Ugh!

08:59.520 --> 09:01.800
Ooh!

09:01.880 --> 09:03.920
Just a little bit of chunder.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.360
Sorry about that.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.120
A technicolor yawn.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.040
Let me ask you a question.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.040
Why do you need MENTOR?
What are you gonna do with it?

09:14.720 --> 09:18.480
We're either gonna make trillions
by auctioning it off at The Meadows

09:19.240 --> 09:21.640
or maybe create our own version of truth.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.400
You didn't get enough votes
to win an election? Sure, you did.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.160
As long as MENTOR says so.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.400
Led a massacre on your own people?

09:29.960 --> 09:33.320
With MENTOR, you can prove
that it actually didn't happen.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.000
Holy jumpin'!

09:35.080 --> 09:37.000
I know a few people
who would pay for that.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.400
Me too, Skippy.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.160
<i> Whoa, whoa! Hang on!</i>
<i>What are you doing, Patty-cakes?</i>

09:42.240 --> 09:43.080
Voilà.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.160
<i>MENTOR mainframe</i>
<i>has been opened.</i>

09:45.240 --> 09:47.280
Here, put this on.

09:49.040 --> 09:54.280
-Patty, what am I wearing?
-It's PPE! Homemade. Isn't it cute?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.040
Hey, come on, hurry up.
We don't have much time, sir.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.280
<i>You are now entering</i>
<i>the MENTOR mainframe.</i>

10:04.120 --> 10:05.760
<i>Please wear PPE.</i>

10:06.680 --> 10:07.960
<i>No smoking.</i>

10:10.720 --> 10:12.080
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

10:12.160 --> 10:14.720
<i>that means that someone</i>
<i>has tried to dismantle MENTOR.</i>

10:14.800 --> 10:16.760
<i>And I don't blame you.</i>
<i>He's kind of a prick really.</i>

10:16.840 --> 10:18.040
<i>But what's important</i>

10:18.120 --> 10:22.000
<i>is that the whole system</i>
<i>doesn't overheat for more than 30 seconds.</i>

10:22.080 --> 10:25.600
<i>That could cause a complete meltdown,</i>
<i>and all the knowledge that has been gained</i>

10:25.680 --> 10:28.040
<i>since the Library of Alexandria</i>
<i>could be lost,</i>

10:28.120 --> 10:30.560
<i>including the 11th herb or spice</i>

10:30.640 --> 10:33.280
<i>that Colonel Sanders had put</i>
<i>into his Kentucky Fried Chicken.</i>

10:35.440 --> 10:37.360
Now where was I?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.520
Oh yeah!

10:39.280 --> 10:41.240
Let me tell you how I killed them.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.160
<i>I put Donette in Jason's bong.</i>

10:50.880 --> 10:52.720
I thought I had convinced the Pentaverate

10:52.800 --> 10:55.680
to replace Jason
with my old mate Skippy here.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.040
I met Bruce many years ago
when he was still a media baron.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.520
<i>He stayed at one</i>
<i>of my casinos in Macao.</i>

11:09.600 --> 11:11.000
Bruce!

11:11.080 --> 11:13.280
Oh, there you are!

11:13.360 --> 11:17.760
<i> And let's just say</i>
<i>Bruce is a man of exotic taste.</i>

11:23.200 --> 11:25.640
I like feet. No shame.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.600
But instead they went with Clark.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.240
Yeah,
which totally sucked ass for me,

11:33.320 --> 11:36.800
because I already told my trophy bitch
of a wife to go fuck herself.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.240
So I did a total 180,
bought her a bunch of flowers

11:40.320 --> 11:43.480
and ate a big shit sandwich
until Bruce here could call me in.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.040
With The Meadows quickly approaching,
I had to act fast,

11:46.120 --> 11:49.200
<i>-so I poisoned Clark.</i>

11:49.280 --> 11:52.880
Then the Maester got too close,
so it was bye-bye for him.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.320
<i>And Frick and Frack.</i>

11:54.400 --> 11:56.080
<i>Cut off their heads.</i>

11:56.920 --> 12:00.000
Uh, sorry,
why would you cut off their heads?

12:00.080 --> 12:01.800
Two reasons, sheila.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.080
Shizzies

12:03.160 --> 12:04.000
and gizzies.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.880
At least I didn't cut off their dicks.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.440
<i>Well, actually, I did,</i>
<i>and then I sewed them back on.</i>

12:12.120 --> 12:15.080
<i>Nice touch.</i>

12:15.160 --> 12:18.040
My point is, I brought in Skip
then the Red Robes,

12:18.120 --> 12:21.360
and then all I needed
was to get theParce Clavem,

12:21.440 --> 12:25.520
giving me ultimate control
of the Pentaverate by having three votes.

12:25.600 --> 12:29.400
But then you went and touched it,
you dopey Canadian bastard!

12:29.480 --> 12:30.520
Ow!

12:31.160 --> 12:36.640
Now I need you with your stupid key
to get three votes to sell MENTOR.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.400
I'll never help you destroy the world!

12:39.480 --> 12:41.320
The world's already destroyed.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.400
The Internet destroyed it.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.440
I'll never understand
people like you.

12:46.520 --> 12:51.440
You have all the access to resources,
to money, knowledge, power,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.520
to do something good for this world,

12:54.200 --> 12:55.720
and still you choose evil?

12:56.440 --> 12:58.800
-You'll never get away with this.
-You wanna bet?

12:58.880 --> 13:01.000
The world thinks I'm already dead.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.880
And after I get the <i>Face/Off</i> surgery,

13:03.960 --> 13:06.640
I'll be on a beach somewhere
drinking peach Bellinis.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.000
Oh, forgive my manners.
Can I offer you a drink?

13:10.080 --> 13:13.080
-Oh, yes, please. I'm awfully parched.
-So am I, eh?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.320
Here we go.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.600
You've just been drugged.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.080
So have you.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.760
What's going on, Ken?

13:31.840 --> 13:33.760
You seem high.

13:33.840 --> 13:38.240
-Whoo! Whoo!

13:38.320 --> 13:41.720
What's going on
to this airplane?

13:41.800 --> 13:43.800
What's going on, Ken?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.040
Are you high?

13:46.240 --> 13:49.920
Ooh, you seem fucking high, dude.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.320
-Who's a fucked-up man?
-You are! You are!

13:52.400 --> 13:54.240
-Who's a fucked up man?
-You are!

13:54.320 --> 13:57.600
MENTOR is mine.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.320
-All right!
-Okay.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.520
If we remove the transducers,
it's gonna cause MENTOR to overheat.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.400
My dear girl, where did you learn that?

14:10.480 --> 14:12.840
There's a whole chapter on it
in the manual.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.720
Did nobody read the manual?

14:15.320 --> 14:18.680
Forgive me.
That was rather patronizing of me.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.920
Await my command.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Standing by.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.000
All right, here goes nothing.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.720
<i> I wouldn't do that, Patty.</i>
-All right.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.760
<i> I'm wicked smart.</i>

14:45.200 --> 14:46.760
Disengage now!

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
You did it, Patty!

14:52.120 --> 14:53.240
Let's get out of here.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.680
Come on, Lord Lordington!

14:58.200 --> 15:00.520
I'm going as fast as I can, I'm afraid.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.760
-Yes! Yes! Yes! Well-done!

15:03.840 --> 15:06.560
-Good work! Good work! Good work!
-Well-done. Yes!

15:08.400 --> 15:09.680
<i> Rebooting.</i>

15:10.240 --> 15:11.560
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

15:11.640 --> 15:14.920
I had always hoped that MENTOR
would perfect enhanced intelligence

15:15.000 --> 15:18.200
as a means of defeating
the evils of the Internet.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.840
MENTOR needs a soul.

15:19.920 --> 15:24.440
Someone kind, someone empathetic,
someone with a selfless heart.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.000
So not this Dunkin' Douche?

15:26.080 --> 15:27.360
Certainly not.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.720
<i> Hey!</i>
<i>You know I can hear you, right?</i>

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
Hello? Hello?

15:32.480 --> 15:35.800
No, no. All lines
to Dubrovnik have been cut,

15:35.880 --> 15:38.640
and all lines to Meadows have been cut.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.880
-Hello? Hello?
-Yes, we've not much time.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.760
All right, let's shit this fuck.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.080
I'll hold down the fort. You go get 'em.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.360
No, no, Patty.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.280
What you did today confirmed
something that I've long suspected.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
You must join us on the train.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.720
We need you.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.640
Open that door.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.640
Let's get out of here. Come on.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.880
Keep up!

16:52.440 --> 16:55.320
Lord Lordington, do you think
we'll be able to stop Bruce?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.360
I… I honestly don't know.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.360
We do the impossible every day.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.400
Miracles take a little longer.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.480
Mm-hmm.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.800
A word to the wise.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.200
This train is very, very fast.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.320
One can get a bit vommy.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.760
Oh please, I take
the New York City subway every day.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.920
Reilly, are you okay?

17:34.000 --> 17:34.960
I'm good. You?

17:35.040 --> 17:35.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.360
Yeah.

17:47.400 --> 17:52.080
All I wanted to do was break a big story
and get my show back.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.000
But at the end of the day,

17:54.640 --> 17:56.720
I'm just a local news guy.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.320
I should have retired.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.840
I'm getting too old for this.

18:06.640 --> 18:11.040
Maybe some people
aren't meant to change the world.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
Reilly,

18:18.680 --> 18:21.480
I'm so sorry
I got you caught up in all this.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.920
No, no, Ken.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.280
I'm sorry I got <i>you </i>caught up in this.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.400
Did you always have an English accent?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.400
I know not everyone
has to change the world,

18:31.480 --> 18:34.280
but I think we have a chance
to take those chaps down.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.880
-You are English!
-Ken.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.640
-I'm in the Fimbra Manus.
-What? What?

18:47.640 --> 18:51.080
I was sent to Toronto by the Pentaverate
a year ago to take you to headquarters.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.000
-Holy jumpin'--
-It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.520
I will explain everything.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.040
In the final episode.
