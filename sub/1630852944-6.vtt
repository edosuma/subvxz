00:14.660 --> 00:16.158
Sarah, this way.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.959
- What do you know?
- I don't know what time.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.459
But he's supposedly
planning an attack today.

00:20.460 --> 00:23.358
"Hashtag five.
The day of reckoning."

00:23.360 --> 00:25.726
Today's date is in his notes.

00:25.727 --> 00:27.259
We don't know what kind
of bomb it is,

00:27.260 --> 00:29.359
or who would send it, or when.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.793
Nobody saw him leave the house,

00:30.794 --> 00:31.959
we don't know
how he's travelling.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.326
We don't know what he's wearing.

00:33.327 --> 00:35.493
There's a box of fireworks
under the bed.

00:35.494 --> 00:38.259
There are no viable devices
here. That's all been checked out.

00:38.260 --> 00:41.259
- Okay.
- The digital investigation team is on its way,

00:41.260 --> 00:44.526
- to look at that lot.
- Okay.

00:44.527 --> 00:48.159
- Thanks for coming.
- Why would I not come to work?

00:48.160 --> 00:51.226
- Fine.
- Just... let me look.

00:51.227 --> 00:53.593
You can touch.
Everything's being videoed.

00:53.594 --> 00:57.114
I'm not going to be doing
any touching. Just an advisor.

01:02.094 --> 01:04.959
One way is, we remove
the hard drive,

01:04.959 --> 01:07.193
make a forensic image,
using a write blocker.

01:07.194 --> 01:09.893
You wouldn't need the password,
and you'd have access to everything.

01:09.894 --> 01:11.893
It's the safest
and the best way.

01:11.894 --> 01:13.526
You damage nothing,
lose nothing.

01:13.527 --> 01:15.759
- What's the catch?
- John.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.693
- What's she doing here?
- Advising. What's the catch?

01:18.694 --> 01:21.293
We're gonna need to
take it away. It'll take time.

01:21.294 --> 01:24.926
- We haven't got time.
- Or... we triage.

01:24.927 --> 01:28.893
We have a device, a piece of
software you plug into the USB.

01:28.894 --> 01:33.559
We get in, we explore, we drag
out any files we want. Ben can do it.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.526
- Is he up to it?
- Fresh out of training.

01:36.527 --> 01:39.693
That's why I chose him.
Ben can do it here and now,

01:39.694 --> 01:41.226
But we do need a password.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.593
How? Where from?

01:43.594 --> 01:45.359
Well, the suspect's tech savvy.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.426
He's up to no good. He'll be
changing his password all the time.

01:48.427 --> 01:49.926
He won't be able
to remember them.

01:49.927 --> 01:51.693
He'll have to keep
a note of them.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.926
On his phones, maybe?

01:53.927 --> 01:56.193
He's been trimming piping,

01:56.194 --> 01:57.893
by the looks of things.

01:57.894 --> 01:59.693
Lots of pieces, apparently.

01:59.694 --> 02:01.959
Possibly to pack
with explosives.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.726
- The fireworks.
- They're Category three. Show rockets.

02:04.727 --> 02:07.293
They contain a good amount
of gun powder.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.826
There's a sewing machine.
He's been trimming fabric.

02:09.827 --> 02:11.159
Maybe altering a garment.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.426
- Possibly making a suicide vest.
- Jesus.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.126
Okay, and what makes you...

02:16.127 --> 02:20.393
He'd need to put pockets or
partitions on a waistcoat maybe,

02:20.394 --> 02:23.959
or something to hold those lengths
of pipe, packed with explosives.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.393
- If that's what he's done.
- Can you stop it?

02:27.394 --> 02:29.693
- It depends how it's activated.
- Do you know?

02:29.694 --> 02:32.159
- No.
- If it's phone activated.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.759
Well, that's one for
the digital investigation team.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.559
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.826
Boss, no driving license in
the name of Sam or Elliott Kielty.

02:42.827 --> 02:45.494
Thanks Saf. Okay.

02:46.327 --> 02:48.159
How bulky would it be?

02:48.160 --> 02:50.759
Could you ride a bike if you
were wearing a suicide vest?

02:50.760 --> 02:55.694
Possibly. You need to cover it with
something. A big coat or a jacket maybe?

02:57.460 --> 03:00.959
I also found this.
This is a plan of circuitry.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.693
It fits with the electrical circuitry
of a suicide vest. It has a safe arm.

03:05.694 --> 03:07.860
- See... Could you...
- Sure.

03:16.994 --> 03:19.127
Now, what the hell's all this?

04:04.658 --> 04:09.192
These look like pin numbers.
These look like phone numbers.

04:09.193 --> 04:12.090
These...
These look like passwords.

04:12.091 --> 04:15.459
- Can you copy them out into separate groups?
- Sure.

04:15.460 --> 04:18.509
Right.
What do you want from us?

04:21.594 --> 04:22.959
Where's Neil?

04:22.960 --> 04:26.693
He's possibly on a bike.
He's possibly heading into town.

04:26.694 --> 04:30.259
If he's wearing a suicide vest, he
won't get through security, anywhere.

04:30.260 --> 04:33.826
He'll be looking for a crowd.
He's gonna want to go big.

04:33.827 --> 04:36.493
He's maybe looking
for a crowd outdoors.

04:36.494 --> 04:38.359
We're triaging his computer now.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.693
Boss, we found his other bike. The
one he had when we interviewed him.

04:41.694 --> 04:43.593
So, he's maybe not on a bike.

04:43.594 --> 04:48.159
Er, CCTV, all routes from
here, public space CCTV.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.359
We think he may be
wearing a big coat.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.959
Can we evacuate the city centre?

04:51.960 --> 04:53.793
No, we don't have the resources.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.726
We could evacuate
people into trouble.

04:55.727 --> 04:57.859
We could flood the town
with uniformed officers.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.593
But we make no announcements.

04:59.594 --> 05:01.259
We need to keep people safe.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.359
We create panic, no one's safe.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.560
Exactly.

05:09.727 --> 05:13.994
Boss, we're looking at
public space CCTV now, yeah.

05:17.994 --> 05:20.226
- So, you reckon these are phone numbers?
- Yeah.

05:20.227 --> 05:22.393
- And the phones have gone to the lab?
- Yes.

05:22.394 --> 05:25.559
So, if this guy's wearing
a phone-activated suicide vest,

05:25.560 --> 05:27.826
- can it be stopped with a phone?
- You wouldn't need a phone.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.193
If you knew where he was,

05:29.194 --> 05:32.059
you could shut down
the phone mast closest to him.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.726
- What's the worst case?
- This is an encrypted system.

05:34.727 --> 05:38.826
Worst-case scenario? The wrong
pin renders the computer useless.

05:38.827 --> 05:42.923
Maybe not permanently. But we
need an administrator to bypass it.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.859
Of course.

05:44.860 --> 05:47.359
Well, it would be a disaster
to paralyze the computer,

05:47.360 --> 05:48.893
but it's worse not to get in.

05:48.894 --> 05:51.926
He's written here,
"Look straight at the camera."

05:51.927 --> 05:55.393
If he's filmed himself on his
computer, it could tell us where he is.

05:55.394 --> 05:57.226
And what he's planning.

05:57.227 --> 06:00.893
Can Azra start trying
these pin numbers, or what?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.993
He cleared it. Do it.

06:02.994 --> 06:06.927
More recent.
This ink looks fresher. Go.

06:11.294 --> 06:13.526
Thank you, Azra. Brilliant.

06:13.527 --> 06:16.959
Well, it's only got us through to
logging in. We need a password now.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.159
Three passwords. There are
three usernames. Three accounts.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.840
- Which one?
- Elliott.

06:22.127 --> 06:23.359
Elliott.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.926
Boss, Professor Gordon
wants you.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.326
We've gone through his rubbish.

06:27.327 --> 06:29.259
Packaging from
a pressure switch.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.759
Packaging from a safety switch.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.993
What does it mean?

06:31.994 --> 06:34.559
This is maybe how
he's triggering the device.

06:34.560 --> 06:38.259
A pressure switch. Release
the switch, the bomb goes off.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.593
But to avoid accidentally
triggering the bomb,

06:40.594 --> 06:42.693
you also have a safety switch
called the safe arm.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.193
Only when the safe arm is off,

06:44.194 --> 06:46.826
will the bomb be armed,
and the pressure switch work.

06:46.827 --> 06:48.026
No phone required.

06:48.027 --> 06:50.293
No, it...
It's mechanical, it's basic.

06:50.294 --> 06:53.593
It's very smart. No phone,
no GPS, no digital element.

06:53.594 --> 06:55.059
It makes you very hard to find.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.693
Very hard to stop.

06:56.694 --> 07:00.159
What's the range of this device?
I mean, the destructive range.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.026
- Boss, Mrs McKinven wants you.
- I'll be back.

07:03.027 --> 07:05.993
"E" for "Elliott"?
Okay, try that one.

07:05.994 --> 07:07.826
How many times are you
allowed to get along?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.393
We don't know until we try.

07:09.394 --> 07:11.059
We're in.

07:11.060 --> 07:12.459
Go to his browser.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.959
Shit!

07:14.960 --> 07:18.359
- What?
- Browser's empty, there's nothing there. Um...

07:18.360 --> 07:20.693
Go back. Try another account,
another username.

07:20.694 --> 07:23.359
I think this browser allows
multiple profiles.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.693
- Let's see if there are any other.
- Ah, brilliant, Ben.

07:26.694 --> 07:28.026
Go ahead, try one.

07:28.027 --> 07:31.927
- Electronic equipment.
- Yeah, bookmarks.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.726
Search history...

07:34.727 --> 07:38.459
- Bit of shopping. Not much action.
- Okay, try another profile.

07:38.460 --> 07:39.794
Here we go.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.860
Where's his media player?

07:51.360 --> 07:52.894
Professor Gordon.

08:01.794 --> 08:04.193
Got his media player.

08:04.194 --> 08:08.027
Look at this.
It goes live today.

08:09.994 --> 08:13.293
My name is Sam Kielty.

08:13.294 --> 08:16.560
That name will become familiar
as of today.

08:17.927 --> 08:19.127
Infamous...

08:20.127 --> 08:23.359
When I was alive,
I lived in obscurity.

08:23.360 --> 08:27.026
At three o'clock this afternoon,
in Dundee in Scotland,

08:27.027 --> 08:29.971
the Beta Revolution
graduated to another level.

08:31.127 --> 08:34.926
A body count
to surpass all others.

08:34.927 --> 08:38.831
I know some of you won't be
happy about it. But you know what?

08:41.460 --> 08:43.592
I never liked the V&A.

08:43.594 --> 08:46.693
Boss, they picked him up
on CCTV.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.594
He got off a bus on Tay Street.
He's in town.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.093
Do not let that bus
leave the depot.

08:53.094 --> 08:55.359
Get somebody over there
and speak to the driver.

08:55.360 --> 09:00.672
Did he meet anybody on the bus, did he leave
anything on there, did he say anything?

09:39.546 --> 09:41.847
- Have you seen Erika?
- No.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.378
- She didn't show up to assist in class.
- Right.

09:44.379 --> 09:46.709
She's not in the PhD room and
she's not answering her phone.

09:46.710 --> 09:49.211
The dean is looking for you.

09:49.212 --> 09:52.145
Sarah's been called away
by DCI McKinven.

09:52.146 --> 09:55.154
Okay, do you think you can
keep the dean at bay?

09:55.646 --> 09:57.778
- Leave it with me.
- Thanks.

09:57.779 --> 09:59.745
Oh, Kathy.

09:59.746 --> 10:03.345
It's possible I may soon be in a position
to furnish you with something useful.

10:03.346 --> 10:05.346
Something about Euan McMillan?

10:15.179 --> 10:17.011
Dispatch to all units,

10:17.012 --> 10:19.278
white British male,
23 years of age, slim build

10:19.279 --> 10:21.511
auburn hair, pale complexion.

10:21.512 --> 10:24.578
He's wearing a dark blue
knee-length coat, dark trousers,

10:24.579 --> 10:26.678
a dark blue baseball cap
with no logo

10:26.679 --> 10:28.612
and grey trainers.

10:41.112 --> 10:43.211
- How many people can this bomb kill?
- I don't know.

10:43.212 --> 10:45.945
- Roughly.
- It... It's too dangerous to speculate.

10:45.946 --> 10:50.178
But you're looking at, maybe, two or three
times the power of the church hall bomb.

10:50.179 --> 10:53.571
We just handed it over
to the bomb scene manager. Aye.

10:53.746 --> 10:54.911
Sure.

10:54.912 --> 10:56.311
Boss.

10:56.312 --> 10:59.078
Sam Kielty was in the bus alone.
He left nothing behind.

10:59.079 --> 11:00.611
He spoke to the driver.

11:00.612 --> 11:03.178
He asked him, "What's the best
bus to get to Broughty Ferry?"

11:03.179 --> 11:05.678
Don't head into town, Neil.
We're covered.

11:05.679 --> 11:07.411
Head up to Broughty Ferry.

11:07.412 --> 11:08.545
Fine.

11:08.546 --> 11:09.978
Where's Sarah Gordon?

11:09.979 --> 11:13.278
- With me.
- Well, get her back here, with Azra.

11:13.279 --> 11:15.745
We need them both here,
straight away.

11:16.879 --> 11:18.678
Here, boss.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.878
That's what I would say
if I wanted Ford to believe

11:20.879 --> 11:23.078
I was off to Broughty Ferry
and not the V&A.

11:23.079 --> 11:24.759
He's gone the other way.

11:25.812 --> 11:27.012
Neil...

11:28.012 --> 11:30.345
If he's wearing
a suicide vest...

11:30.346 --> 11:31.978
He'll possibly have
the pressure switch

11:31.979 --> 11:34.678
in one hand, maybe in a pocket,
maybe outside.

11:34.679 --> 11:36.611
The safety switch
could be anywhere.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.378
Maybe in his other pocket,
I don't know.

11:38.379 --> 11:41.111
If you can keep his hands
away from the safety switch,

11:41.112 --> 11:42.311
he can't do anything.

11:42.312 --> 11:44.211
He won't do anything
in Broughty Ferry.

11:44.212 --> 11:47.604
- He's gone the other way.
- Safi! We just don't know.

12:13.846 --> 12:17.411
I imagine you're angry,
or disappointed.

12:17.412 --> 12:21.545
And I would like a chance to clarify
what happened, and talk to you.

12:21.546 --> 12:24.745
Um... please call me, Erika.
It's Kathy.

12:24.746 --> 12:26.346
Professor Torrance.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.546
Your imperfect supervisor.

12:53.446 --> 12:56.078
This is a live situation.

12:56.079 --> 12:59.011
A suicide bomber, Sam Kielty.

12:59.012 --> 13:04.545
Now, Kielty's manifesto suggests
a plan to attack at 3:00 p.m. today.

13:04.546 --> 13:06.778
We believe he is wearing
a suicide vest.

13:06.779 --> 13:09.678
How stable is it?
Could it be set off with impact?

13:09.679 --> 13:12.678
No, it needs to be detonated
with an electrical charge.

13:12.679 --> 13:14.378
That's what
the pressure switch is for.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.545
You release the pressure,
you complete the circuit.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.078
The safety switch keeps
the electrical circuit open.

13:19.079 --> 13:22.545
If the safety switch is off,
and we shoot the device,

13:22.546 --> 13:24.411
- it detonates?
- Yes.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.278
As soon as we get eyes on him,
we shoot him.

13:27.279 --> 13:29.545
- Blow him up.
- If he's isolated.

13:29.546 --> 13:31.545
Hard to picture that
in the city centre.

13:31.546 --> 13:33.811
We have a duty of care,
even to him.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.811
To serve the public,
we shoot him. What's the option?

13:36.812 --> 13:38.945
Talk him down, disarm him.

13:38.946 --> 13:41.778
I want Kielty to face terrorist
charges. I want him alive.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.978
The best outcome is
we talk him down.

13:43.979 --> 13:46.978
I can't see it. I mean, what
state's this guy gonna be in?

13:46.979 --> 13:51.745
Well, he hasn't slept. We can see
the hours he's been active online.

13:51.746 --> 13:54.645
He hasn't had more than
two hours sleep a day, for days.

13:54.646 --> 13:58.145
He's running on energy drinks,
and adrenaline.

13:58.146 --> 13:59.978
And he's got a bomb
strapped to him.

13:59.979 --> 14:01.659
That's the state he's in.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.145
- I think he might wanna target families.
- How come?

14:10.146 --> 14:12.811
Well, that's the outcome
of men and women having sex.

14:12.812 --> 14:14.278
That's where it gets you.

14:14.279 --> 14:17.278
Bet you he goes to the V&A
and HMS Discovery and that.

14:17.279 --> 14:19.279
He'll be where the people are.

14:20.312 --> 14:21.845
I don't want to die.

14:21.846 --> 14:23.611
You piece of shit.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.611
- I don't...
- You disgust me.

14:26.612 --> 14:29.145
- You're pathetic.
- I will do it.

14:29.146 --> 14:32.245
- Yeah, right.
- I will. Shut up.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.546
You've got an hour to prove that
you're not a disgrace to humanity.

14:37.679 --> 14:41.111
Think of all the bitches
and bastards

14:41.112 --> 14:42.811
who've ruined your life.

14:42.812 --> 14:45.811
Think of the injustice. Do it.

14:45.812 --> 14:48.212
Kevin.

14:49.646 --> 14:52.545
- Kevin, come here! Kevin. Sorry.
- Fuck off and die.

14:52.546 --> 14:54.378
Sorry. He's a menace. Sorry.

14:54.379 --> 14:55.778
Learn to control your dog.

14:55.779 --> 14:58.246
Right.
Have a lovely day yourself.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.824
If you're as sad as you look,
you're very, very sad indeed.

15:20.612 --> 15:22.545
I come here when I'm sad.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.011
I look over there
and wish I was there.

15:25.012 --> 15:26.878
And sometimes I do go over there

15:26.879 --> 15:28.678
and wish I was here. Daft, eh?

15:28.679 --> 15:30.646
Just leave me alone, will ya?

15:32.246 --> 15:33.646
I'm called Kim.

15:34.646 --> 15:36.006
What's your name?

15:37.846 --> 15:39.778
I think you could use
a bit of sugar.

15:39.779 --> 15:40.911
Do you want some Toble?

15:40.912 --> 15:42.112
No!

15:55.979 --> 15:57.212
You sure?

16:18.312 --> 16:20.312
- My name's Elliott.
- Elliott?

16:24.046 --> 16:26.745
I'm so sorry you're feeling sad.

16:26.746 --> 16:28.345
But you know something?

16:28.346 --> 16:31.354
You probably won't have
these feelings tomorrow.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.545
I won't even be feeling
like this in an hour's time.

16:43.546 --> 16:45.379
See? There you go.

16:46.712 --> 16:48.878
You've got any friends
you can call?

16:48.879 --> 16:51.479
- No.
- You've got somewhere you can go?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.545
I've got somewhere to go, yeah.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.226
Something I've got to do.

16:57.079 --> 16:59.079
You're gonna be able to do it.

17:00.546 --> 17:01.746
Yeah.

17:27.246 --> 17:28.879
I got your message.

17:30.012 --> 17:31.778
You think it's a joke.

17:31.779 --> 17:33.545
What?

17:33.546 --> 17:35.611
You think you can make a joke
about being imperfect, and I'll melt?

17:35.612 --> 17:38.078
- No, I was...
- You're my supervisor.

17:38.079 --> 17:40.845
You're supposed to support me
and help me develop my work.

17:40.846 --> 17:42.545
- Not steal it.
- I didn't steal it.

17:42.546 --> 17:45.111
You appropriated it by omitting
to acknowledge it was mine.

17:45.112 --> 17:47.445
- Listen...
- And you have so little respect for me,

17:47.446 --> 17:50.311
that when I make a complaint,
you brush it away.

17:50.312 --> 17:52.278
The dean has offered me
her full support,

17:52.279 --> 17:54.978
if I choose to pursue this
as a formal complaint.

17:54.979 --> 17:58.307
And I told her I'm grateful
that someone has my back.

18:10.779 --> 18:13.245
Surveillance guys
in town are having no luck.

18:13.246 --> 18:16.546
Surveillance guys here,
or up by the station.

18:18.746 --> 18:20.112
What was that?

18:23.779 --> 18:24.979
Go!

18:26.979 --> 18:28.179
Let's go.

19:02.669 --> 19:05.135
McKinven and Khurana
have eyes on him.

19:05.234 --> 19:09.268
Three surveillance officers
are also in position now.

19:09.269 --> 19:13.493
We believe him to be wearing a
suicide vest packed with explosives.

19:14.169 --> 19:16.969
We also have
two firearms officers in situ.

19:19.502 --> 19:21.134
If the crowd
disperses naturally,

19:21.135 --> 19:23.768
and creates some distance
around him, we'll shoot?

19:23.769 --> 19:25.601
- We can't just shoot him.
- We can justify it.

19:25.602 --> 19:28.634
- We know his intent.
- We pulled uniformed officers out,

19:28.635 --> 19:30.201
so as not to panic him.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.301
We can't disperse the crowds
ourselves for the same reason.

19:32.302 --> 19:34.234
Kielty doesn't even know
we're on to him.

19:34.235 --> 19:36.568
Well, the second he does,
he will detonate.

19:36.569 --> 19:39.035
- Unless we talk him out of it.
- How?

19:44.469 --> 19:46.934
Come in, firearms.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.834
- I'm on Westhill.
- Can we shoot him?

19:49.835 --> 19:52.268
- No chance, too busy.
- Who's close?

19:52.269 --> 19:53.934
Khurana and McKinven.

19:53.935 --> 19:56.068
- Can we take him out?
- I don't know.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.369
Too many people.

20:06.602 --> 20:07.901
We're closing in.

20:07.902 --> 20:10.068
Looks like he's heading
out the building.

20:10.069 --> 20:12.202
McKinven and Khurana
are closest.

20:25.035 --> 20:27.968
He's approaching a crowd
of families. Hands in pockets.

20:27.969 --> 20:30.869
Shoot him!

20:31.935 --> 20:33.168
Can you hear me?

20:33.169 --> 20:35.202
Shoot him in the head.

20:42.402 --> 20:44.735
Come in! Can you hear me?

20:57.069 --> 20:59.434
I'm the police.
You're under arrest.

20:59.435 --> 21:02.571
- Bombs, murder...
- I'll tell you the rest later.

21:07.502 --> 21:09.334
What's going on?

21:09.335 --> 21:12.302
It's Safi.

21:14.069 --> 21:15.334
Hi, Safi.

21:15.335 --> 21:16.569
DCI McKinven.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.468
We've done it.
We've got Kielty.

21:21.469 --> 21:24.469
Nobody hurt.
We'll make an exit.

21:30.402 --> 21:32.735
On your knees.

21:33.635 --> 21:35.968
Okay, device disarmed.

21:35.969 --> 21:38.601
Are we being safe?
Have we cautioned him?

21:38.602 --> 21:40.868
Aye, he's been
fully cautioned now.

21:46.987 --> 21:49.268
"You're exactly
what I'm looking for."

21:49.269 --> 21:51.934
That's what you said to me
when I came for my interview.

21:51.935 --> 21:55.436
I was so happy to come here, and
work with you and be part of SIFA.

21:55.437 --> 21:58.634
I'm a long way from home.
I don't have any friends here.

21:58.635 --> 22:00.735
All I wanted was to belong.

22:01.635 --> 22:03.315
That's all anyone wants.

22:07.102 --> 22:08.302
Here.

22:11.169 --> 22:13.669
- Do you want a...
- No, thanks.

22:19.035 --> 22:23.668
Erika, it was remiss of me not to
acknowledge your data when I gave the talk.

22:23.669 --> 22:27.401
That was a bad mistake,
and I apologise.

22:27.402 --> 22:30.401
But I did fully acknowledge
your work and our collaboration

22:30.402 --> 22:33.002
in the copy I submitted
to the brochure.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.001
Right here, "Erica Shroff."

22:36.002 --> 22:37.769
No one reads the brochure.

22:45.269 --> 22:47.801
People do want to belong,
you're right about that.

22:47.802 --> 22:51.568
I think that's what you and McMillan
wanted, to connect, to belong.

22:51.569 --> 22:54.101
And he couldn't. He didn't
talk to anyone about it,

22:54.102 --> 22:56.734
- and he wasn't supported.
- Yeah.

22:56.735 --> 22:59.634
I guess it's been
a similar situation for me.

22:59.635 --> 23:01.768
Let's try to keep
some perspective.

23:01.769 --> 23:03.068
What do you mean?

23:03.069 --> 23:05.568
We got in a mess,
but we're talking about it.

23:05.569 --> 23:08.268
Euan felt so isolated,
he took his own life.

23:08.269 --> 23:11.634
I've been really unhappy.

23:11.635 --> 23:14.568
I wanted to come to you before,
but you're not easy to talk to.

23:14.569 --> 23:16.534
Oh, wow.

23:16.535 --> 23:19.601
You told me to knock on your door in
the middle of the night if I felt spooked.

23:19.602 --> 23:21.001
I'm a very private person.

23:21.002 --> 23:22.301
You didn't have to punish me.

23:22.302 --> 23:24.168
I was just embarrassed.
None of this is personal.

23:24.169 --> 23:27.568
When someone's mean to you,
it is personal.

23:27.569 --> 23:31.334
Look, I don't always
communicate well.

23:31.335 --> 23:33.434
I know I can be caustic,

23:33.435 --> 23:38.835
and I'm really sorry
I hurt your feelings.

23:40.102 --> 23:42.034
Thanks.

23:42.035 --> 23:43.934
You didn't even do
anything embarrassing.

23:43.935 --> 23:48.468
You just said Pia had met
someone else, and passed out.

23:48.469 --> 23:52.034
I pulled the covers over you
and went back to my room.

23:52.035 --> 23:54.934
Well, I guess it would have been
better to talk about this at the time,

23:54.935 --> 23:56.701
I could've avoided
a lot of dramatics.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.668
Dramatics?

23:58.669 --> 24:02.001
Well, it sounds like your Santorini
complaint was more of a protest about how...

24:02.002 --> 24:03.801
How you treated me.

24:03.802 --> 24:06.601
It is. I knew
I couldn't prove that.

24:06.602 --> 24:10.501
I knew it was your word against
mine, and you have all the power.

24:10.502 --> 24:13.301
So, when the dean alerted me
to the Santorini talk,

24:13.302 --> 24:18.634
I thought, "Okay. This is
provable. I'll run with this."

24:18.635 --> 24:20.468
The dean alerted you?

24:20.469 --> 24:22.468
You're not even listening
to me right now.

24:22.469 --> 24:25.135
- No, Erika, I am. I just...
- Forget it!

24:27.735 --> 24:29.415
Hey, just checking in.

24:30.335 --> 24:32.302
Fine. Yeah. Fine.

24:34.169 --> 24:37.468
Everything's... fine.

24:37.469 --> 24:39.335
Janine, can I call you back?

24:39.502 --> 24:40.702
Okay.

24:43.469 --> 24:45.602
Neil's quite the hero, isn't he?

24:47.269 --> 24:48.701
Yeah.

24:48.702 --> 24:50.334
He will come back to me.

24:50.335 --> 24:53.168
- He isn't with me.
- That's what men do. They go back.

24:53.169 --> 24:55.701
- Don't you think?
- I think all men are different.

24:55.702 --> 24:59.268
- Hmm. Do you have children?
- Just one.

24:59.269 --> 25:01.335
We couldn't. Low sperm count.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.068
I don't want to have
this conversation.

25:05.069 --> 25:06.749
Are you in love with him?

25:07.635 --> 25:10.168
I don't want to have
this conversation.

25:10.869 --> 25:12.149
I bet you don't.

25:14.602 --> 25:18.634
All forensic science
is not equal.

25:18.635 --> 25:23.034
Drug analysis, forensic
toxicology, forensic anthropology,

25:23.035 --> 25:29.801
entomology, paint, glass, and fibre
analysis are all underpinned by science.

25:29.802 --> 25:33.334
Forensic gate analysis,
analysis of shoe prints,

25:33.335 --> 25:38.568
tyre marks, ballistics, even
fingerprint comparison, are not.

25:38.569 --> 25:42.834
The comparison process
of these kinds of evidence

25:42.835 --> 25:47.434
is mainly subjective and essentially
based on spotting the difference.

25:47.435 --> 25:49.701
And who is spotting
the difference?

25:50.402 --> 25:51.802
A human.

25:52.935 --> 25:55.169
And what do humans sometimes do?

25:56.035 --> 25:57.901
Make mistakes. Get it wrong.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.368
Congratulations, Neil.

26:11.369 --> 26:13.268
We'd like you
to conduct the interview.

26:13.269 --> 26:14.468
Excellent, thank you.

26:14.469 --> 26:16.301
We'll need
a watertight strategy.

26:16.302 --> 26:18.468
Azra, Sarah, stay put.

26:18.469 --> 26:19.669
A word.

26:21.702 --> 26:24.334
You have a formal complaint
procedure hanging over your head.

26:24.335 --> 26:26.301
- You can't just avoid me.
- I've been busy.

26:26.302 --> 26:28.901
Professor Torrance,
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

26:28.902 --> 26:32.368
I do apologise, but I need to speak
to Professor Torrance urgently.

26:32.369 --> 26:33.768
We're in the middle
of a conversation.

26:33.769 --> 26:35.301
I would never normally do it,

26:35.302 --> 26:39.334
but... it concerns Professor
Gordon and the Dundee bomber.

26:39.335 --> 26:42.634
I will deliver Kathy back to you
as soon as we've dealt with this.

26:42.635 --> 26:43.835
Thank you.

26:47.269 --> 26:48.769
Is Sarah okay?

26:50.269 --> 26:52.834
She's right as rain.
Ingenue?

26:52.835 --> 26:54.368
They've got him.

26:54.369 --> 26:57.168
- Oh, wow.
- Indeed.

26:57.169 --> 27:00.334
Now, I had to play my ace card
to get you away from the dean,

27:00.335 --> 27:04.175
because I think before you
speak to her, you should see this.

27:09.502 --> 27:10.503
Come in.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.972
Hey, Kathy.

27:12.973 --> 27:16.414
As far as I'm concerned,
my complaint's answered.

27:16.415 --> 27:19.807
It's over. I appreciate
how straight you were with me.

27:20.969 --> 27:23.769
And I know I can be a bit
of a drama queen.

27:24.702 --> 27:27.536
I guess we're both
pretty eccentric, huh?

27:27.537 --> 27:32.040
Anyway, I just wanna continue
to do the work with you.

27:36.935 --> 27:38.215
Awesome. Me too.

27:39.469 --> 27:41.834
Sarah, can you set me up
with specific questions

27:41.835 --> 27:44.801
- which establish he made each device, please?
- Sure.

27:44.802 --> 27:47.701
Azra, will you and Ben
pull anything from that computer

27:47.702 --> 27:49.468
that shows the progression
of his thinking.

27:49.469 --> 27:51.401
Yep, no problem.

27:51.402 --> 27:55.234
We've already traced him by the Dundee's
logon, and posting the black pill GIF.

27:55.235 --> 27:57.634
Great, but I really want
to get inside his head.

27:57.635 --> 28:00.168
Don't get hung up about his
thinking until we've got all we need

28:00.169 --> 28:02.368
to prove he did it,
and how he did it.

28:02.369 --> 28:05.434
Sure, but I will go wherever
he wants to go if he's talking.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.001
I just need to get him talking.

28:07.002 --> 28:09.401
Police casualty sergeant says
Kielty's fit to be interviewed.

28:09.402 --> 28:10.868
What's his mental state?

28:10.869 --> 28:12.668
He's very subdued. Not talking.

28:12.669 --> 28:17.213
If he gives a "no comment", would
the evidence so far stand up in court?

28:25.368 --> 28:28.501
Hi, I'd like to go over
something with you.

28:28.502 --> 28:30.236
You want me to help
get Erika off your back?

28:30.237 --> 28:33.201
You're the one who fired her up to
complain about me in the first places.

28:33.202 --> 28:35.601
So, no, I don't need your help.
Erika and I have figured it out.

28:35.602 --> 28:38.502
- I didn't fire her up.
- Oh, I know you did.

28:39.166 --> 28:41.834
Your PA, Heather, used
to be the old dean's PA.

28:41.835 --> 28:43.401
Janine and Heather are friends.

28:43.402 --> 28:45.101
I had them do some
checking around,

28:45.102 --> 28:46.901
because you made me suspicious
when you were so keen

28:46.902 --> 28:48.801
to find out how
Euan McMillan died.

28:48.802 --> 28:50.301
Did he commit suicide?

28:50.302 --> 28:51.801
It certainly looks that way.

28:51.802 --> 28:53.134
Because he was unhappy here?

28:53.135 --> 28:55.801
We'll never know exactly
what was going on with Euan,

28:55.802 --> 28:57.134
because he didn't talk to anyone

28:57.135 --> 28:59.001
but we do know
we didn't help him.

28:59.002 --> 29:01.634
You told me the first you knew of
him was hearing about him in the news.

29:01.635 --> 29:02.867
Because it's true.

29:02.868 --> 29:04.901
Well, here's what I heard.

29:04.902 --> 29:08.434
You inherited a report sent to the old dean
about a problem in the school of science

29:08.435 --> 29:12.034
with students withdrawing, and
struggling with poor mental health,

29:12.035 --> 29:13.967
and committing suicide.

29:13.968 --> 29:17.201
There was a list of students identified
as being a serious cause for concern.

29:17.202 --> 29:18.467
Euan McMillan was one of them.

29:18.468 --> 29:19.634
I didn't know that.

29:19.635 --> 29:21.467
You did!

29:21.468 --> 29:24.301
The report called for urgent
action to look after students

29:24.302 --> 29:26.134
and prevent further suicides.

29:26.135 --> 29:29.301
- So, why didn't the old dean do something about it?
- He should have.

29:29.302 --> 29:30.801
He got it before he left.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.867
I think he did an unforgivably
cowardly thing,

29:32.868 --> 29:34.301
and left it for you deal with.

29:34.302 --> 29:36.901
He did. That's exactly
what he did.

29:36.902 --> 29:40.701
My first day here, I arrive
with all my vision and ambition,

29:40.702 --> 29:41.967
and the first thing
that happens,

29:41.968 --> 29:44.934
I mean,
the first thing that happens,

29:44.935 --> 29:47.401
is all the dirty laundry
is dumped on my desk.

29:47.402 --> 29:49.867
All the HR files,
all the disputes.

29:49.868 --> 29:53.001
Sexting, stalking, cheating.
You name it.

29:53.002 --> 29:54.801
All the debts,
all the complaints,

29:54.802 --> 29:58.934
all the problems are now my problems,
which nobody mentioned to me before.

29:58.935 --> 30:00.334
And that's shitty.

30:00.335 --> 30:02.434
You were dealt a shitty hand,
so why make it worse?

30:02.435 --> 30:06.101
Heather emailed you the report and
asked if you'd gotten it, and you replied,

30:06.102 --> 30:09.734
"Yes, I have. Can we park this
while we're fundraising?"

30:09.735 --> 30:11.701
No, no, no, no, no.
What I meant...

30:11.702 --> 30:13.967
Let's pretend students aren't killing
themselves, because it's not a good look?

30:13.968 --> 30:16.134
That is not what I meant.

30:16.135 --> 30:17.901
The fundraising was underway.

30:17.902 --> 30:22.167
- I couldn't give it my full attention.
- It's too late for excuses.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.901
Are you gonna go public with it?

30:23.902 --> 30:26.601
No, you're gonna go to the
principal's office and explain all this,

30:26.602 --> 30:28.434
and if you still have a job,

30:28.435 --> 30:31.434
we're gonna work out how we can
actually support our students from now on.

30:31.435 --> 30:34.834
I mean, really support them.
Not just promise it on a poster.

30:34.835 --> 30:36.401
You've changed your tune.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.001
Excuse me?

30:38.002 --> 30:41.134
The first time we met, you
moaned about students being needy.

30:41.135 --> 30:45.202
Well, they are, and we
have to deal with it.

30:47.435 --> 30:49.267
Will you come with me?

30:49.268 --> 30:52.202
To the principal's office
to help me explain.

30:53.535 --> 30:55.215
It would really help.

30:57.268 --> 30:58.735
Sure, why not?

30:59.602 --> 31:01.434
"Chads and Stacys."

31:01.435 --> 31:05.734
"Fit stripper guys. Good looking,
sexually active stripper girls."

31:05.735 --> 31:08.701
"Normies." Okay, well,
that's self-explanatory.

31:08.702 --> 31:10.801
- L-D-A-L?
- Lie down and rot.

31:10.802 --> 31:14.567
As in, my situation is so hopeless,
I may as well lie down and rot.

31:14.568 --> 31:17.101
- Chincel?
- An incel with a weak chin.

31:17.935 --> 31:19.135
Roasties?

31:19.468 --> 31:20.801
A roasty?

31:20.802 --> 31:23.601
- You don't wanna know.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

31:23.602 --> 31:27.167
Okay... Well,
apologies in advance.

31:27.168 --> 31:29.434
When a woman has had
so much sex,

31:29.435 --> 31:32.568
her labia look like
slices of roast beef.

31:33.002 --> 31:34.468
Ah, nice.

31:37.102 --> 31:39.967
Um, you know we talked about
Kielty maybe buying bleach online.

31:39.968 --> 31:41.501
Have you come across
that transaction?

31:41.502 --> 31:43.701
We have.

31:43.702 --> 31:47.834
- Safi, you know what my mum used to say?
- No.

31:47.835 --> 31:50.735
It's the quiet ones you need
to watch out for.

31:54.802 --> 31:57.301
- I can't stand it.
- You have to.

31:57.302 --> 31:59.867
Don't let her see
she's getting to you.

31:59.868 --> 32:01.534
Just get out of there
as soon as you can.

32:01.535 --> 32:02.735
Okay.

32:03.202 --> 32:04.534
How did you get on today?

32:04.535 --> 32:07.134
I've been communicating.

32:07.135 --> 32:11.334
I've been apologising.
I fought for justice and won.

32:11.335 --> 32:14.634
- And I was right about the dean.
- How?

32:14.635 --> 32:16.801
Oh, I'll tell you all about it
when you're done.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.502
Ah, Sarah...

32:20.368 --> 32:22.901
You're one of the people
who caught the Dundee bomber.

32:22.902 --> 32:25.235
- Hold your head high.
- Okay.

32:26.302 --> 32:27.801
You too.

32:27.802 --> 32:31.567
You know, you say and do things
no one else would dare to.

32:31.568 --> 32:32.967
Just keep doing it.

32:32.968 --> 32:34.168
I need to. Bye.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.401
Sam, can we get you anything?

32:54.502 --> 32:55.782
Anything to eat?

32:59.135 --> 33:04.167
When you were at the charge bar, you
were offered the services of a solicitor,

33:04.168 --> 33:06.934
to which you're entitled, but
you declined. Is that correct?

33:06.935 --> 33:08.135
Correct.

33:14.602 --> 33:16.668
I'm wondering why you did that.

33:18.702 --> 33:21.267
Okay, well just to remind you,

33:21.268 --> 33:22.701
you can speak to a solicitor

33:22.702 --> 33:25.035
at any time
during these interviews.

33:29.368 --> 33:32.101
Are there any more bombs
planted anywhere?

33:33.368 --> 33:36.467
Sam, it's gonna be all right.

33:36.468 --> 33:38.267
Not if he doesn't talk.

33:38.268 --> 33:41.434
He needs to ask him how he made
the devices. He'll wanna talk about that.

33:41.435 --> 33:44.134
Do you want to knock on the door
and suggest that to Neil?

33:44.135 --> 33:45.367
Sure.

33:45.368 --> 33:47.401
How did you make these devices?

33:47.402 --> 33:49.034
You made five different
kinds of bombs.

33:49.035 --> 33:51.401
How on earth did you know
how to make them all?

33:51.402 --> 33:55.267
We had a professor of forensic
chemistry working on those devices,

33:55.268 --> 33:58.667
She said they were
more and more sophisticated.

33:58.668 --> 34:01.834
It can't have been easy
learning how to do it all.

34:01.835 --> 34:03.275
I know who turned.

34:05.435 --> 34:06.795
I can't hear you.

34:08.034 --> 34:09.235
Sam...

34:10.435 --> 34:14.635
I think if you big me up,
I'll talk.

34:21.368 --> 34:23.801
I don't need to big you up.

34:23.802 --> 34:26.934
You made five different kinds
of explosive devices.

34:26.935 --> 34:28.935
You destroyed three buildings.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.534
Terrorised the city.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.215
You killed six people.

34:42.534 --> 34:43.802
Yes, I did.

34:46.702 --> 34:48.400
The device you
were wearing today,

34:48.402 --> 34:51.266
had two or three times the power
of your first bomb at church hall.

34:51.268 --> 34:52.367
Says who?

34:52.368 --> 34:54.202
The expert. The professor.

34:55.335 --> 34:57.201
You must have had some help.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.568
No, it's all my own work.
Just me.

35:08.135 --> 35:10.901
Why did you
write numbers on them?

35:10.902 --> 35:15.167
Each bomb is part of a series.
A progressive series.

35:15.168 --> 35:18.801
Are there any more bombs
planted anywhere?

35:18.802 --> 35:23.134
The only really challenging part is the buying
of chemicals in the quantities you need.

35:23.135 --> 35:26.034
Are there any more bombs
out there, you bastard?

35:26.035 --> 35:28.701
Our experts have been
digging through your hard drives.

35:28.702 --> 35:30.835
Blue pill, red pill, black pill.

35:31.435 --> 35:33.301
We've been looking
at your life online.

35:33.302 --> 35:36.101
In forums, on chat rooms
with incels like yourself

35:36.102 --> 35:38.567
around the world
amongst that community,

35:38.568 --> 35:41.896
and we think we can see
how one thing led to another.

35:41.902 --> 35:43.134
Blue pill.

35:43.135 --> 35:44.401
The state of innocence,

35:44.402 --> 35:46.801
where you think
the world is okay

35:46.802 --> 35:48.802
and as it seems.
Is that right?

35:49.202 --> 35:50.801
Red pill.

35:50.802 --> 35:54.534
The world is not as it seems.
It's rigged and hostile to you,

35:54.535 --> 35:57.934
but at least, armed with that knowledge,
you can try and improve your situation.

35:57.935 --> 35:59.801
You start to seek
self-help online.

35:59.802 --> 36:03.601
You find gurus, how to build your
confidence, how to get a six-pack.

36:03.602 --> 36:06.634
How to talk to women.
How to pick up women.

36:06.635 --> 36:11.601
And everything you watch online is followed
by a suggestion of the next thing to watch.

36:11.602 --> 36:15.122
And every suggestion takes
you just a wee bit deeper in.

36:17.602 --> 36:19.868
We got this from a clinic.

36:21.102 --> 36:22.565
Leda Aesthetics.

36:28.335 --> 36:30.015
What's going on here?

36:30.835 --> 36:32.901
I was gonna get my jaw widened.

36:33.268 --> 36:34.628
- Why.
- Fuck off!

36:36.402 --> 36:38.034
Why?

36:38.035 --> 36:39.901
You look fine.
You look good.

36:42.702 --> 36:44.082
Well, why didn't you
go through with it?

36:44.083 --> 36:46.216
Because none of it
fucking works!

36:48.535 --> 36:49.735
Black pill.

36:51.135 --> 36:54.067
You were prescribed
an antidepressant Serepax.

36:54.068 --> 36:56.134
- I stopped taking it.
- Why?

36:56.135 --> 36:58.634
'Cause how I feel is
a rational response to reality.

36:58.635 --> 37:01.035
- And how do you feel?
- Fucked over.

37:02.902 --> 37:05.168
Are there any more bombs
out there?

37:15.135 --> 37:17.567
Do you know how many times
I've been rejected by women?

37:17.568 --> 37:18.801
No.

37:18.802 --> 37:20.435
316 times.

37:22.602 --> 37:24.101
Wow.

37:24.102 --> 37:26.201
Can you imagine the loneliness?

37:26.202 --> 37:27.567
When you say rejected...

37:27.568 --> 37:29.634
I make an approach.
They reject.

37:30.935 --> 37:32.334
That must be very hurtful.

37:32.335 --> 37:34.668
I would treasure
and cherish a girl.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.802
I would treat her
like a princess.

37:39.435 --> 37:41.301
I have so much love to give.

37:42.035 --> 37:43.868
No. Sorry, not wanted.

37:45.468 --> 37:49.467
They would rather have some
obnoxious hench guy than a gentleman.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.534
How would you approach a woman?

37:54.235 --> 37:55.435
Are you single?

38:04.202 --> 38:07.568
Yes. I am recently single.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.235
Clever.

38:12.502 --> 38:14.902
How many women
have you had sex with?

38:16.902 --> 38:18.102
Two.

38:20.868 --> 38:22.068
Very clever.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.168
I win.

38:25.002 --> 38:26.202
None.

38:27.602 --> 38:30.067
I am 23 years of age.

38:30.068 --> 38:34.801
The average age for a guy to
lose his virginity is 16.9 years of age.

38:34.802 --> 38:38.234
I've never even held a girl's
hand, except my sister's.

38:38.235 --> 38:41.534
In actual fact, I'd be frightened
to have sex with a women now

38:41.535 --> 38:43.801
that she'd just turn around
and accuse me of rape.

38:43.802 --> 38:45.901
- Why?
- 'Cause it happens all the time.

38:45.902 --> 38:47.201
It doesn't happen all the time.

38:47.202 --> 38:49.202
Check your facts, okay!

38:50.635 --> 38:52.315
Get yourself informed!

38:53.402 --> 38:55.301
People need to know
what's really going on here,

38:55.302 --> 38:56.742
because it's dark.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.067
The natural order's
been overturned.

39:00.068 --> 39:01.967
This is scientifically proven,
okay.

39:01.968 --> 39:06.801
I can show you hundreds of scientific
and historical theses that support this.

39:06.802 --> 39:09.534
When gender roles follow
the biological, natural order,

39:09.535 --> 39:12.201
men thrived, women were content,

39:12.202 --> 39:13.634
the economy was good.

39:13.635 --> 39:16.001
Then men went to war
and died for their country,

39:16.002 --> 39:17.735
and women took their jobs.

39:18.335 --> 39:20.467
Men's status has been
eroded so slowly,

39:20.468 --> 39:22.467
no one noticed.
But we wake up now,

39:22.468 --> 39:24.667
and masculinity is toxic.

39:24.668 --> 39:27.667
Touching women on the elbow
is sexual assault.

39:27.668 --> 39:30.134
Helping a woman understand
something is mansplaining.

39:30.135 --> 39:33.267
You make a joke,
and 50 feminazis cut you down!

39:33.268 --> 39:35.267
Do you want them? Or do you
not want them? Women.

39:35.268 --> 39:37.001
They are snakes with tits.

39:39.968 --> 39:41.201
Why did you take a break?

39:41.202 --> 39:43.101
'Cause I wanted to batter him.

39:43.102 --> 39:46.334
You're doing really well, Neil, but we
need to know if there are more bombs.

39:46.335 --> 39:49.967
It won't work. He's
feeding on me pushing him.

39:49.968 --> 39:53.232
He's getting off on the
power trip of not answering.

40:04.965 --> 40:08.099
Do you think the way you found
out about my affair was bad?

40:08.100 --> 40:14.101
But you tell me what you've
done like that, in here. Jesus Christ!

40:14.102 --> 40:17.955
It was time to tell the truth.

40:19.602 --> 40:21.434
Let's just both tell the truth.

40:21.435 --> 40:24.301
You want me today,
'cause I'm the guy today.

40:24.868 --> 40:26.388
But when I'm not...

40:27.402 --> 40:28.602
You don't.

40:30.535 --> 40:32.735
Well, she doesn't
want you either.

40:34.502 --> 40:37.102
- Has Professor Gordon gone?
- Yes.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.768
Yep. She's gone.

40:44.468 --> 40:46.834
I checked my facts.

40:46.835 --> 40:50.667
False claims of rape are actually rarer
than false claims of other kinds of crime.

40:50.668 --> 40:51.734
Safi, see what you...

40:51.735 --> 40:53.701
- About toxic...
- Aye.

40:53.702 --> 40:57.101
To me, toxic masculinity
isn't that men are toxic.

40:57.102 --> 41:00.734
So, the old idea of what a man should
be, doesn't work for men or women.

41:00.735 --> 41:03.134
Look at him,
clutching his pearls.

41:03.135 --> 41:04.801
What are you trying to achieve?

41:04.802 --> 41:07.267
What does taking your loneliness
out on innocent people achieve?

41:07.268 --> 41:08.468
Not innocent.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.835
I'll inspire others
to join the rebellion.

41:14.335 --> 41:18.101
To shake the foundations
of society.

41:18.102 --> 41:20.567
To subjugate the voice
of oppressors.

41:20.568 --> 41:22.802
Normies, Stacys, Chads.

41:24.202 --> 41:27.002
- Have you ever heard of the Moonies?
- No.

41:30.402 --> 41:34.867
A year ago,
you got into Gyno Slam,

41:34.868 --> 41:37.801
which is more black pill than the incel
forums you'd visited up to that point.

41:37.802 --> 41:39.867
- Would that be fair?
- Guess so.

41:39.868 --> 41:41.834
And very early on,

41:41.835 --> 41:46.467
in response to a post called, "Bitches
are the problem." "Rape is the answer,"

41:46.468 --> 41:48.634
- you posted a reply. Remember?
- No.

41:48.635 --> 41:49.901
You posted:

41:49.902 --> 41:52.101
"Do you ever wonder
if your attitude to women"

41:52.102 --> 41:54.234
"might be a factor
in your failure with them?"

41:54.235 --> 41:55.567
You tell me what happened next.

41:55.568 --> 41:57.267
I left the forum.

41:57.268 --> 41:59.301
No, you were booted off the
forum. You were bullied off of it.

41:59.302 --> 42:01.134
You were cancelled
by the brotherhood.

42:01.135 --> 42:03.601
You changed your user
name and joined Beta Room,

42:03.602 --> 42:05.334
a forum as extreme as Gyno Slam,

42:05.335 --> 42:07.334
but you barely
posted anything at first.

42:07.335 --> 42:09.501
It's as if you were
learning the ropes.

42:09.502 --> 42:11.501
You closely follow one
or two leading lights.

42:11.502 --> 42:13.834
One guy in Australia,
another in Canada.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.534
Who we'll be talking to.

42:15.535 --> 42:18.167
And then you start posting
stuff. Strong stuff, violent stuff.

42:18.168 --> 42:21.367
You rise up the ranks.
You're in with the big boys.

42:21.368 --> 42:24.934
You hero-worship Elliot Rodger,
the incel who killed six people.

42:24.935 --> 42:29.801
You adopt the name Elliot, and then
you start boasting about outdoing him.

42:29.802 --> 42:31.301
The big boys,
say you won't do it.

42:31.302 --> 42:32.701
You say you'll prove them wrong.

42:32.702 --> 42:34.382
I did prove them wrong.

42:39.419 --> 42:42.053
The Moonies were
a religious cult.

42:42.054 --> 42:44.801
Before, we used to joke about
being brainwashed by the Moonies.

42:44.802 --> 42:47.135
We'd say groomed now
or radicalised.

42:48.268 --> 42:50.001
They found lost souls.

42:50.002 --> 42:54.434
Offered them an identity, an ideology
and a community, and certainty.

42:54.435 --> 42:57.601
And that's key in a cult.
Doubt's a no-no.

42:57.602 --> 43:01.634
If you question, you're part of
the problem. You get it in the neck.

43:01.635 --> 43:02.934
Like you did.

43:02.935 --> 43:04.801
Only you went back for more.

43:06.802 --> 43:08.402
You nearly got away.

43:10.435 --> 43:12.568
Six people would still be alive.

43:14.502 --> 43:16.901
Do you know what
would have happened, son?

43:16.902 --> 43:19.467
Instead of spending the rest of
your life in jail, like you're going to.

43:19.468 --> 43:21.334
I think you're gonna tell me.

43:21.335 --> 43:23.834
You'd have grown out of it.
You'd have ditched all that.

43:23.835 --> 43:25.534
The lies, the hate
and the blame,

43:25.535 --> 43:28.401
'cause it wouldn't have
served you any more.

43:30.668 --> 43:32.268
You'd have moved on.

43:50.435 --> 43:52.635
There are no more bombs
out there.

43:53.502 --> 43:54.702
Yes!

44:13.568 --> 44:14.768
Sarah.

44:17.668 --> 44:19.534
I thought you'd stand me up.

44:20.002 --> 44:21.401
Why?

44:21.402 --> 44:24.922
Because I said such awful things
to you the other night.

44:26.702 --> 44:28.201
You laugh when you're nervous.

44:28.202 --> 44:29.301
I do.

44:29.302 --> 44:31.902
- It's disconcerting.
- I can't help it.

44:32.902 --> 44:35.502
Look, I said awful things.

44:37.102 --> 44:39.502
I rushed you. I blew it.

44:40.168 --> 44:41.368
No, you didn't.

44:46.202 --> 44:48.402
I do not expect anything
from you.

44:49.202 --> 44:50.402
Good.

44:53.868 --> 44:55.068
I love you.

45:01.268 --> 45:03.268
I don't know how to take that.

45:05.002 --> 45:08.635
Sorry. I'm... I'm serious.

45:09.335 --> 45:10.535
If you still...

45:13.635 --> 45:15.501
I would love to be with you.

45:18.235 --> 45:21.819
I need to talk to Campbell.
I don't know how I'm gonna...

45:23.402 --> 45:24.682
It's gonna be...

45:28.902 --> 45:30.262
I just need time.
