I mean, a week ago baiting iguanas

01:16:24.118 --> 01:16:26.204
with candy would have
seemed crazy to me.

Yeah, I know, but this

Friendly natives, angry poachers,
terrifying cliffs.

Why run away at all?

01:16:59.362 --> 01:17:02.323
I had to get away from my parents.

01:17:02.407 --> 01:17:04.283
Why would you want to do that?

01:17:06.369 --> 01:17:07.412
Uh...

- it's a defence mechanism.
