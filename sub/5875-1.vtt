00:21.161 --> 00:25.761
Lullaby and goodnight

00:26.441 --> 00:31.441
With roses bedight

00:32.121 --> 00:36.961
With lilies o'er spread

00:37.681 --> 00:42.961
Is baby's wee bed

00:43.641 --> 00:49.041
Tomorrow morn, if God deems

00:49.681 --> 00:54.761
You will wake from your dreams

00:55.361 --> 01:00.841
Tomorrow morn, if God deems

01:01.681 --> 01:07.841
You will wake from your dreams

01:10.881 --> 01:12.281
Good night.

02:33.801 --> 02:34.801
You're it!

02:34.881 --> 02:37.921
One, two, three, four...

02:38.281 --> 02:38.961
Five!

03:48.401 --> 03:49.641
Lukas?

05:05.121 --> 05:07.281
11, 12

05:08.241 --> 05:10.681
13, 14

15,16

05:14.441 --> 05:16.921

05:17.921 --> 05:20.201
19, 20...

05:20.921 --> 05:22.001
Lukas?

05:36.281 --> 05:37.481
Lukas?

06:30.041 --> 06:31.441
Mom?
- Mom?

06:52.121 --> 06:53.081
Mom?

07:13.241 --> 07:15.041
That's a fine hello.

07:25.921 --> 07:27.641
Look at your clothes.

07:28.921 --> 07:32.001
Filthy. Take them off right now.

07:33.401 --> 07:34.561
Not here!

07:35.321 --> 07:39.161
Undress by the washing machine.
And then take a shower.

07:40.441 --> 07:41.641
Move it!

08:22.881 --> 08:24.161
There you are.

08:24.281 --> 08:25.401
Thanks.

08:32.481 --> 08:34.520
Lukas wants some too.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.961
Then he can ask me himself.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.361
You only made supper for me.

08:46.161 --> 08:47.441
You know why.

09:01.921 --> 09:04.081
You should apologize.

09:20.921 --> 09:23.081
Am I a person?
- No.

09:23.841 --> 09:25.961
Am I a thing?
- Yes.

09:26.321 --> 09:28.601
Am I a cell phone?
- No.

09:31.081 --> 09:33.401
Am I a pair of pants?
- No.

09:33.601 --> 09:35.601
Can you wear me?
- No.

09:35.801 --> 09:38.081
Can you eat me?
- No.

09:40.001 --> 09:42.801
Do you need me every clay?
- Yes.

09:51.681 --> 09:54.041
Am I hair?
- No.

09:54.441 --> 09:55.801
It's a thing.

09:57.001 --> 09:59.121
That's needed in daily life.

10:00.281 --> 10:02.441
You use it almost every clay.

10:02.921 --> 10:04.241
Do I?

10:06.281 --> 10:08.161
Not by yourself, but...

10:10.321 --> 10:12.521
A car?
- Yes, right.

10:13.641 --> 10:15.281
You got it.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.641
Am I an animal?
- No.

10:37.001 --> 10:39.281
Am I a thing?
- No.

10:39.921 --> 10:41.321
Am I a person?

10:41.561 --> 10:42.761
Yes.

10:43.681 --> 10:46.281
Am I a man?
- No.

10:47.241 --> 10:48.761
Am I a woman?
- Yes.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.641
A grown-up?
- Yes.

10:52.201 --> 10:53.801
Am I still alive?

10:54.041 --> 10:55.081
Yes.

10:57.361 --> 10:58.761
Am I on TV?

10:59.001 --> 11:00.041
Yes.

11:00.241 --> 11:01.281
Am I...

11:02.281 --> 11:03.281
a TV hostess?

11:03.881 --> 11:04.881
Yes.

11:07.721 --> 11:10.361
Am I on German TV?
- No.

11:10.801 --> 11:12.561
Austrian.

11:12.841 --> 11:14.441
Am I famous?

11:18.041 --> 11:19.801
Well, sort of.

11:22.121 --> 11:23.561
Barbara Karlich?

11:24.801 --> 11:25.881
No.

11:37.201 --> 11:38.441
A clue?

11:40.441 --> 11:42.561
You like animals.

11:47.281 --> 11:49.081
You like animals.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.441
Come on!

11:56.441 --> 11:58.121
You like animals.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.241
Another clue.

12:05.161 --> 12:07.561
You have two kids.

12:09.881 --> 12:13.681
How do I know who has two kids?
Do I know the person?

12:13.801 --> 12:14.601
Yes.

14:01.361 --> 14:02.441
Lukas!

14:41.321 --> 14:42.321
That's enough.

14:43.921 --> 14:44.801
That's it.

14:44.921 --> 14:46.681
Come on!
- Mom!

14:46.841 --> 14:48.281
I have something to say.

14:48.841 --> 14:50.201
We were playing!

14:50.401 --> 14:51.441
I don't care.

14:51.601 --> 14:53.121
Dad lets us play.

14:53.281 --> 14:55.561
I don't care what your clad does.

14:56.401 --> 14:58.201
This is important.

14:58.401 --> 15:00.441
I want you to look at me.

15:02.881 --> 15:05.121
So start already.
- Excuse me?

15:05.401 --> 15:06.561
Nothing.

15:08.881 --> 15:10.841
The doctor said I need rest.

15:11.441 --> 15:14.681
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.

15:16.121 --> 15:18.521
I want absolute quiet in the house.

15:18.801 --> 15:21.041
I have to sleep. If it's important,

15:21.201 --> 15:22.481
knock.

15:23.641 --> 15:24.801
And no visitors.

15:24.961 --> 15:26.321
If anyone asks,

15:26.481 --> 15:27.921
Mom is ill.

15:28.281 --> 15:30.761
We'll keep the blinds closed.

15:30.961 --> 15:32.681
I have to avoid sunlight.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.481
You'll play only in the garden, quietly.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.281
Bring nothing inside.

15:37.401 --> 15:39.641
No branches, no animals...

15:39.881 --> 15:41.161
What are you doing?

15:42.681 --> 15:44.321
We'll start over.

15:44.801 --> 15:45.881
Right?

15:46.001 --> 15:48.841
We need to hold this family together.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.601
One from me and one from Lukas.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.441
Very nice.

15:55.601 --> 15:58.321
I'm serious about what I just said.

15:58.561 --> 16:00.561
We won't forget, right?

16:01.361 --> 16:02.441
Good.

16:03.041 --> 16:04.761
It's bedtime now.

16:09.081 --> 16:10.161
Good night.

16:19.721 --> 16:22.001
She's so different.
- Well...

16:22.361 --> 16:24.121
It's just the operation.

16:24.801 --> 16:26.321
You think?

16:26.801 --> 16:27.961
Yeah.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.441
I don't know.

16:29.641 --> 16:31.921
How would you feel

16:32.121 --> 16:36.361
if you'd had an operation like that?

16:37.681 --> 16:38.961
I don't know.

16:39.281 --> 16:41.721
She's not like our mom.

16:42.601 --> 16:44.521
Play it again.

16:53.361 --> 16:56.321
I'm giving you lots and lots of kisses.

16:57.921 --> 17:00.161
I can't wait until I'm back.

17:00.521 --> 17:04.601
Pull the covers up and close your eyes.

17:05.721 --> 17:09.001
Can you count the stars that brightly

17:09.441 --> 17:12.521
Twinkle in the midnight sky?

17:13.281 --> 17:16.840
Can you count the clouds, so lightly

17:17.281 --> 17:20.401
O'er the meadows floating by?

17:21.001 --> 17:24.641
God, the Lord, doth mark their number

17:24.961 --> 17:28.761
With His eyes that never slumber

17:29.121 --> 17:32.681
You He sees and you He loves

17:33.281 --> 17:37.161
You He sees and you He loves

17:38.201 --> 17:39.681
Good night.

20:47.401 --> 20:49.241
Get Mom.

21:34.681 --> 21:35.961
Mom?

22:17.841 --> 22:19.401
Lukas?

22:42.961 --> 22:44.041
Lukas?

23:06.841 --> 23:09.321
Hello?
- Hi, good morning.

23:10.361 --> 23:14.241
You sure placed a killer order.
So much, all at once.

23:14.441 --> 23:17.161
Someone having a party?
- No.

23:18.521 --> 23:20.521
Who's all this pizza for?

23:20.961 --> 23:23.921
Pepperoni, pepperoni?
Is that your favorite?

23:25.881 --> 23:28.201
Pepperoni pizza. You must love it.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.041
Yeah.

23:30.161 --> 23:32.281
Bought enough for a year.

23:32.681 --> 23:35.481
There we go, it's all in there.

27:53.521 --> 27:55.001
Open up.

27:57.881 --> 27:59.281
What in hell...

28:00.841 --> 28:02.441
Since when do we lock doors?

28:02.441 --> 28:03.601
Sorry.

28:51.081 --> 28:53.561
Why is there a lighter in here?

28:54.281 --> 28:56.201
I wanted to burn some books.

28:56.921 --> 28:59.281
Don't act smart.

29:13.881 --> 29:14.801
Get off!

29:17.081 --> 29:18.041
Let him go!

34:20.880 --> 34:22.960
OUR WEDDING

35:33.881 --> 35:39.241
FOR SALE: STYLISH RETREAT,
PRICE ON REQUEST

37:37.441 --> 37:38.401
Lukas!

37:42.361 --> 37:43.001
Leg?

37:44.241 --> 37:45.841
Time for your chores!

37:58.721 --> 38:00.081
Leg?

38:27.681 --> 38:29.241
I've other worries.

38:29.361 --> 38:31.081
I won't play along anymore.

38:31.161 --> 38:35.201
I have to make him stop.
He has to face it.

38:36.681 --> 38:38.041
Wait a second, sorry.

39:08.121 --> 39:09.721
Not here either.

39:11.961 --> 39:13.121
Leg?

39:25.081 --> 39:27.121
Lukas, look.

39:33.201 --> 39:34.921
What's wrong with him?

39:37.561 --> 39:38.721
Leg?

39:44.561 --> 39:47.481
I'm sure it was Mom.

41:19.841 --> 41:20.761
Well?

41:26.161 --> 41:26.961
Fine.

41:31.641 --> 41:32.721
Are you crazy?

41:34.881 --> 41:35.601
Stop that.

41:37.281 --> 41:38.321
What's going on?

41:39.241 --> 41:40.201
What is going on?

41:40.401 --> 41:42.281
We want our mom back.
- What?

41:42.561 --> 41:44.241
We want our mom back.

41:45.681 --> 41:47.121
Have you gone crazy?

41:48.721 --> 41:50.641
Are you out of your mind?

41:51.681 --> 41:53.801
Clean this up and go to your room!

41:54.761 --> 41:56.241
You're not our mom.

42:00.801 --> 42:02.441
To your room!

42:02.721 --> 42:04.361
Show us your birthmark.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.681
Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.

42:06.921 --> 42:08.161
I've had it.

42:09.881 --> 42:11.401
Anything else, maybe?

42:28.601 --> 42:31.241
I want you to say 10 times
that I'm your mother.

42:32.601 --> 42:34.161
Open up!
- Say it.

42:34.441 --> 42:35.841
You're my mom.
- Properly.

42:35.961 --> 42:37.721
You're my mom.

42:37.841 --> 42:38.721
Look at me.

42:38.841 --> 42:40.961
You're my mom, you're my mom...

42:41.921 --> 42:42.761
Louder.

42:42.841 --> 42:44.801
You're my mom.

42:49.241 --> 42:50.721
Stop this foolishness!

42:50.841 --> 42:53.401
I'm not playing along anymore.
Understand?

42:53.561 --> 42:56.161
There'll be only one breakfast
and one set of clothes.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.681
And promise me not to talk
to your brother!

42:59.801 --> 43:00.561
No.

43:01.481 --> 43:02.881
Promise me.

43:05.721 --> 43:08.761
I'm going to get so mad!
Promise me!

43:11.521 --> 43:13.601
Give me your cell. Now!

43:22.841 --> 43:24.241
Stay in your room!

43:40.201 --> 43:42.841
She wants to tear us apart.

44:22.841 --> 44:23.961
Does that hurt?

44:24.921 --> 44:26.441
Does that hurt?
- No.

44:28.001 --> 44:29.081
Does that hurt?

46:05.601 --> 46:07.521
Mom, please come back.

46:09.521 --> 46:11.441
I'll do anything you want.

46:12.441 --> 46:14.201
Please come back.

46:18.361 --> 46:22.361
All I wish for is that you'll come
back to us.

46:56.041 --> 46:57.121
Elias?

49:28.601 --> 49:30.681
Trim around your ear.

49:30.961 --> 49:32.081
Here?

49:41.001 --> 49:42.201
Better?

49:45.161 --> 49:46.641
Now we look the same.

49:47.001 --> 49:49.961
Now she won't be able to tell us apart.

50:08.081 --> 50:10.081
It's me. Open the door.

50:13.001 --> 50:14.361
Are we friends?

50:15.521 --> 50:16.841
I'm not mad anymore.

50:18.601 --> 50:20.041
Please open the door.

50:45.881 --> 50:46.921
Well?

51:00.361 --> 51:01.841
Are we friends again?

51:17.321 --> 51:18.801
I have something.

51:24.321 --> 51:25.201
Thanks.

51:26.201 --> 51:26.961
Thanks.

51:27.681 --> 51:29.561
Great, huh?
- Yes.

51:30.881 --> 51:34.001
Can we go outside and try it?

54:36.641 --> 54:37.601
Yes?

54:47.521 --> 54:48.481
Yes?

54:52.601 --> 54:54.001
What is it?

54:54.561 --> 54:55.761
Can you help us?

54:55.921 --> 54:56.881
Yes.

55:01.561 --> 55:02.801
What's it about?

55:05.561 --> 55:08.481
Are you the priest?
- No, I'm the sexton.

55:10.281 --> 55:11.641
Where's the priest?

55:12.801 --> 55:14.201
He's not here.

55:17.921 --> 55:20.481
Can we call him?
- Yeah.

55:22.881 --> 55:25.081
Sure you can.

55:47.921 --> 55:51.801
Can you come inside
the police station with us?

55:53.161 --> 55:55.401
And talk to the policeman

55:55.521 --> 55:56.961
and explain it to him?

55:57.281 --> 55:58.921
Yeah, no problem.

57:01.321 --> 57:02.641
Open up!

57:10.721 --> 57:13.241
Come out of there! Come out!

57:23.881 --> 57:24.921
Thank you.

57:31.921 --> 57:34.681
Would you like to explain?

57:39.921 --> 57:42.041
It was all a bit much.

57:43.721 --> 57:45.441
The accident. The separation.

01:01:13.361 --> 01:01:14.921
What's going on?

01:01:19.561 --> 01:01:20.841
What's going on?

01:01:22.961 --> 01:01:24.641
Where is our mom?

01:01:28.561 --> 01:01:30.681
I'm going insane. Insane.

01:01:34.241 --> 01:01:35.881
How do I get up?

01:01:36.841 --> 01:01:37.961
You don't.

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.721
Where is our mom?

01:01:46.241 --> 01:01:49.241
Lukas said, "Where is our mom?"

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:52.681
Untie me now.

01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:54.481
No.

01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:56.281
It hurts. Untie me.

01:01:56.401 --> 01:01:57.361
No.

01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:01.721
Tell us where our mom is.

01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:03.281
I'm your mom!

01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:08.081
No.

01:02:19.161 --> 01:02:20.681
Who's she?

01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:29.041
Where are the scissors?

01:02:29.241 --> 01:02:30.201
Who is she?

01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:39.161
A friend.

01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:42.161
We always dressed the same.

01:02:45.921 --> 01:02:47.921
Who is she really?

01:02:52.961 --> 01:02:53.921
Answer.

01:02:56.921 --> 01:02:58.121
Please answer.

01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:35.961
Hi, I'm from Vienna.

01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:40.241
What should I say?
It's my first time doing this.

01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:43.921
I like to cook, watch movies.

01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:47.921
But I also enjoy spending
the evening watching TV.

01:03:48.401 --> 01:03:49.721
Look.

01:04:01.561 --> 01:04:02.561
Go away!

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:05.721
Help me.

01:04:13.001 --> 01:04:14.161
Stop it!

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:16.641
Stop!

01:04:17.681 --> 01:04:20.241
I don't see it.
- What are you doing?

01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:21.521
Take another look.

01:04:22.361 --> 01:04:25.201
What is this? What is this?

01:04:25.601 --> 01:04:29.001
In the video your eyes are brown.
- What?

01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:33.641
They're contacts, Christ!
They're in the bathroom.

01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:53.161
Why are you lying to me?

01:04:58.681 --> 01:05:01.401
I thought we agreed not to believe her.

01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:03.881
So? I changed my mind.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.441
Do you believe her, you retard?

01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:08.041
You're the retard!

01:05:31.681 --> 01:05:32.921
Help!

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.361
Where are the damn scissors?

01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:44.921
Do you understand? Get the scissors!

01:05:55.801 --> 01:05:57.001
Lukas?

01:06:04.281 --> 01:06:05.321
Elias...

01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:08.321
Lukas?

01:06:10.641 --> 01:06:12.881
Sit beside me. Come on.

01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:15.761
Come, Elias. Sit here.

01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:21.081
Come sit beside me, Elias.

01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:27.521
Come on, sit down. So we can talk.

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:30.961
Look.

01:06:36.441 --> 01:06:37.601
Elias...

01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:41.521
You know I'm your mom.

01:06:56.801 --> 01:06:58.361
I can't untie myself.

01:06:58.601 --> 01:07:03.921
Just go to the bathroom,
get the scissors and cut me loose.

01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:11.321
Nothing bad's happened. Cut me loose.

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:17.441
I want you to say 10 times,
"1 won't listen to my brother."

01:07:17.921 --> 01:07:20.321
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...

01:07:20.521 --> 01:07:21.841
Louder, please.

01:07:21.961 --> 01:07:25.041
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...

01:07:25.201 --> 01:07:26.601
I said louder.

01:07:28.201 --> 01:07:30.281
Our mom wouldn't do that.

01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:31.481
More clearly.

01:07:32.441 --> 01:07:33.521
Elias...

01:07:35.881 --> 01:07:37.201
I'm sorry.

01:07:37.761 --> 01:07:38.681
Again.

01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:40.881
I'm sorry, Elias.

01:07:51.241 --> 01:07:52.561
Come now.

01:07:53.481 --> 01:07:55.241
Please. Cut me loose.

01:08:02.921 --> 01:08:04.481
What happened to your nose?

01:08:05.401 --> 01:08:07.601
Nothing. Nothing serious.

01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:09.921
There, you see?

01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:15.401
You'll cut me loose

01:08:15.881 --> 01:08:17.640
and I'll make you breakfast.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.720
Cut my feet loose, they hurt.

01:08:26.441 --> 01:08:27.481
Lukas?

01:08:28.921 --> 01:08:31.481
I know it's hard, but we'll make it.

01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:34.441
Come, just cut my feet loose.

01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:42.481
Come on, it'll take a sec.
I'll make breakfast.

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:48.201
Just cut it.

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:52.001
That's it.

01:08:56.121 --> 01:08:57.481
What are you doing?

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.481
There.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.600
What?

01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:17.201
What is it?

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:21.520
Stop.

01:09:24.001 --> 01:09:26.321
They had to remove it in hospital.

01:09:27.241 --> 01:09:28.801
They're dangerous.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.881
Liar!

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.961
They had to. They had no...

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.761
Admit that it's a lie.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.881
Just cut me loose, please.

01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:51.921
Stop.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560
Stop!

01:10:19.121 --> 01:10:21.041
Tell us where our mom is.

01:10:27.001 --> 01:10:29.001
Tell us where our mom is!

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:29.881
It's open.

01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:32.881
Hello, Red Cross!

01:12:35.441 --> 01:12:36.521
Hello?

01:12:37.601 --> 01:12:40.081
Red Cross. Care to make a donation?

01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:42.001
Is anybody home?

01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:46.921
I'll have a look.

01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:51.401
Hello?

01:12:51.881 --> 01:12:53.041
Red Cross.

01:12:56.721 --> 01:12:57.961
Nobody's there.

01:13:01.761 --> 01:13:04.761
It was unlocked, someone must be home.

01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:11.761
Hello?

01:13:14.561 --> 01:13:16.041
Maybe they're upstairs.

01:13:22.601 --> 01:13:24.001
Red Cross.

01:13:27.121 --> 01:13:28.801
Hello?
- Hello!

01:13:29.681 --> 01:13:30.361
Hello.

01:13:35.561 --> 01:13:36.881
Is your mom home?

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.361
No, she's not home.

01:13:39.521 --> 01:13:41.721
Not upstairs? We heard something.

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:43.841
No, that's our dog.

01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:45.761
She's not home?
- No.

01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:47.121
It's our dog.

01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:51.201
When will Mom be back?

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.601
She'll be home soon.

01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:01.241
Can we wait?

01:14:01.761 --> 01:14:03.161
Where should we wait?

01:14:13.761 --> 01:14:17.561
Hand me the list.
I'll see how much we've collected.

01:14:17.641 --> 01:14:20.561
The money too?
- Yeah, I'll count it.

01:14:21.201 --> 01:14:23.681
Really bad handwriting.
- Yeah.

01:14:23.881 --> 01:14:26.801
You'd swear a doctor had written it.

01:14:26.961 --> 01:14:28.721
It's barely legible.

01:14:30.361 --> 01:14:32.481
Looking forward to school?

01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:34.841
Well...
- It starts soon.

01:14:39.401 --> 01:14:42.721
Where did you go to school before?
- In Vienna.

01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:47.361
A lot more going on there.

01:14:52.561 --> 01:14:55.241
We've already collected a tidy sum.

01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:58.241
If somebody else gives as much as him,

01:14:58.481 --> 01:15:01.001
we'll have done pretty well.

01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:06.081
We'll see how much more we get.

01:15:06.521 --> 01:15:08.761
What do you do all clay?

01:15:09.081 --> 01:15:10.521
Not much.

01:15:20.481 --> 01:15:22.361
I have to go to the toilet.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.401
Is your mom back?

01:15:53.601 --> 01:15:54.801
Not yet.

01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:58.121
Is that your own money?

01:15:58.361 --> 01:15:59.401
No.

01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:07.001
Will your mom be OK with this?
- Yes, I'm sure she will.

01:16:08.121 --> 01:16:10.121
She always gives that much.

01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:14.441
We don't want any trouble.

01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:16.081
You realize that...

01:16:17.521 --> 01:16:21.001
We usually don't
accept money from children.

01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:22.961
That's a lot of money.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:24.881
No, we're allowed.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:28.201
Well, it is a nice house. Just look.

01:16:28.321 --> 01:16:30.801
I guess they can afford it.

01:16:36.601 --> 01:16:38.841
As a thank-you for the donation,

01:16:39.441 --> 01:16:40.801
here's a band-aid.

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.161
Help!

01:16:48.561 --> 01:16:51.441
Help! Help!

01:16:51.601 --> 01:16:54.481
Help! Help!

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.721
Stop! Stop!

01:20:16.241 --> 01:20:19.321
Please prove you're our mom.

01:20:29.321 --> 01:20:32.201
Ask her what my favorite song is.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.561
What's Lukas' favorite song?

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:47.121
Lullaby and Good Night?

01:21:19.001 --> 01:21:20.081
Don't!

01:21:35.801 --> 01:21:40.161
Can you count the stars that brightly

01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:44.201
Twinkle in the midnight sky?

01:21:45.161 --> 01:21:49.121
Can you count the clouds, so lightly

01:21:49.761 --> 01:21:53.441
O'er the meadows floating by?

01:21:54.161 --> 01:21:58.321
God, the Lord, doth mark their number

01:21:58.641 --> 01:22:02.441
With His eyes that never slumber

01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:06.361
You He sees and you He loves

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:10.041
You He sees and you He loves

01:22:31.041 --> 01:22:33.001
Where's our mom?

01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:36.161
Don't you know when you
have to pee?

01:23:37.961 --> 01:23:39.921
We're not changing them.

01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:42.601
Hello?

01:23:47.081 --> 01:23:48.401
Untie me.

01:24:44.641 --> 01:24:46.361
Now change the bed.

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:48.281
Take off the sheets.

01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:52.961
Come on, take them off.

01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:55.361
Elias?

01:26:56.401 --> 01:26:57.961
Where's our mom?

01:26:59.761 --> 01:27:01.201
Elias, come here.

01:27:02.641 --> 01:27:04.161
Where is she?

01:27:10.721 --> 01:27:11.561
Fine.

01:27:13.481 --> 01:27:15.721
Elias, let's make a deal.

01:27:17.081 --> 01:27:18.681
I'll play along again.

01:27:20.161 --> 01:27:22.201
I'll talk to Lukas again.

01:27:23.601 --> 01:27:25.321
Lukas will be alive.

01:27:30.481 --> 01:27:32.521
I'll make you both breakfast,

01:27:32.721 --> 01:27:36.201
put out your clothes.
We'll do things, like before.

01:27:36.321 --> 01:27:38.401
But you have to believe me

01:27:39.001 --> 01:27:40.601
that I'm your mom.

01:27:43.801 --> 01:27:45.921
You won't really do that.

01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:52.361
I promise.

01:27:54.161 --> 01:27:55.281
Elias...

01:27:57.081 --> 01:27:59.881
It's not your fault Lukas died.

01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:04.481
The accident wasn't your fault.

01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:08.441
Do you really believe her?

01:28:16.801 --> 01:28:17.801
She's lying.

01:28:23.921 --> 01:28:26.521
Let her prove she's our mom.

01:28:32.881 --> 01:28:34.361
What am I doing?

01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:37.321
What's Lukas doing?

01:28:42.321 --> 01:28:44.321
But I can't see him!

01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:46.441
What's he doing?

01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:53.401
Elias...

01:28:56.881 --> 01:28:58.881
Mom would know that.

01:29:00.281 --> 01:29:02.081
Mom could see him.

01:29:04.241 --> 01:29:06.401
She'd know what he's doing.

01:29:16.041 --> 01:29:17.401
No, Elias. Don't!

01:29:19.481 --> 01:29:20.841
Elias, don't!

01:29:21.401 --> 01:29:23.081
Elias, do you hear me?

01:29:36.161 --> 01:29:38.161
Help! Help!

01:31:35.081 --> 01:31:38.641
God, the Lord, doth mark their number

01:31:39.081 --> 01:31:42.801
With His eyes that never slumber

01:31:43.161 --> 01:31:46.841
You He sees and you He loves

01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:51.561
You He sees and you He loves
