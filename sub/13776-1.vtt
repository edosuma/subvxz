WEBVTT

00:01.471 --> 00:03.359
In a world

00:04.051 --> 00:08.622
where a man meets a
woman, comes Andre.

00:08.689 --> 00:10.189
Andre.

00:10.258 --> 00:11.258
<i>And Trixie.</i>

00:11.325 --> 00:12.258
Trixie.

00:12.325 --> 00:15.294
Is this his
wedding invitation?

00:18.064 --> 00:23.736
<i>And this summer, they meet up</i> in...
<i>Top Groom.</i>

00:26.773 --> 00:28.706
Is she still allergic
to his semen?

00:28.774 --> 00:29.707
Yeah.

00:29.775 --> 00:30.608
Yup.

00:30.676 --> 00:32.677
They should have
called it <i>Risky Jizzness.</i>

00:32.744 --> 00:34.011
<i>Missionary Impossible.</i>

00:34.079 --> 00:36.514
<i>Cum Far and Away from My Vagina.</i>

00:36.582 --> 00:37.582
<i>Thighs Wide Shut.</i>

00:37.650 --> 00:38.683
<i>Cum Man.</i>

00:38.751 --> 00:40.251
That doesn't make any sense.

00:40.319 --> 00:41.886
It's <i>Rain Man,</i> but with cum.

00:41.953 --> 00:43.321
<i>A Few Good Semen.</i>

00:43.389 --> 00:44.655
You can't handle my cum!

00:44.722 --> 00:45.656
Whoa!

00:45.723 --> 00:48.191
So, please celebrate with
us this Labor Day weekend.

00:48.259 --> 00:51.428
In Los Angeles, the
City of Andrels.

00:51.496 --> 00:52.696
Oh, God.

00:52.764 --> 00:53.997
That's terrible.

00:54.064 --> 00:56.065
He's plowing her with his
little angel donger.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.436
Even in the afterlife, he's
got a substandard peen.

00:58.556 --> 01:01.652
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:01.772 --> 01:03.706
All right, let the Sacko
punishments begin.

01:03.774 --> 01:04.706
I live for this.

01:04.775 --> 01:05.507
There he is!

01:05.575 --> 01:06.509
Ruxin!

01:06.576 --> 01:07.510
Bam!

01:07.577 --> 01:08.544
Hello, Ruxin.

01:08.612 --> 01:09.545
Hey, guys.

01:09.613 --> 01:10.546
It's time.

01:10.614 --> 01:11.547
Time for what?

01:11.615 --> 01:12.648
This is your day, bud.

01:12.716 --> 01:13.649
Really?

01:13.717 --> 01:15.117
Here's Sacko!

01:15.185 --> 01:17.852
You're not supposed
to wear the outfit.

01:17.920 --> 01:18.886
Yeah, right.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.888
You try not putting
this thing on.

01:20.956 --> 01:21.889
Taco, it's for him.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.360
And, Rodney Ruxin, I can think
of no better way to start

01:25.428 --> 01:28.262
off Sacko season than with your
first punishment, which will

01:28.331 --> 01:32.433
include said Sacko suit with
said Sacko balls, walking into a

01:32.500 --> 01:35.336
vegan restaurant, reading this.

01:35.403 --> 01:37.371
"Don't you want me
in your mouth?"

01:37.439 --> 01:38.505
Yeah!

01:38.573 --> 01:40.374
You know what I'm thinking?

01:40.442 --> 01:42.509
No.

01:42.577 --> 01:43.544
Excuse me?

01:43.611 --> 01:45.412
No, I won't do it.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.514
Okay, dum-dum here is
really not getting it.

01:47.582 --> 01:48.715
Listen to me, Ruxin.

01:48.782 --> 01:51.517
You put the head on like this.

01:51.585 --> 01:54.887
And then you run at people like this.

01:54.955 --> 01:55.888
Check out my balls!

01:56.957 --> 01:58.891
You're gonna want to get the
balls right up in there.

01:58.959 --> 01:59.625
Oh, my God!

01:59.693 --> 02:00.693
No!

02:01.762 --> 02:02.729
Nice!

02:02.796 --> 02:03.730
Yes!

02:03.797 --> 02:04.763
You son of a bitch!

02:04.831 --> 02:06.030
Just like this, Ruxin.

02:06.098 --> 02:07.265
How do you like that?!

02:07.333 --> 02:08.767
Yeah, I think I'm good.

02:08.835 --> 02:09.835
No, no, you're not good.

02:09.901 --> 02:11.837
You have to fulfill
the Sacko duties.

02:11.904 --> 02:12.838
Tell him he has to do it, Jenny.

02:12.905 --> 02:16.608
Yeah, if you don't fulfill your Sacko
duties, you're not in the league.

02:16.676 --> 02:18.877
Ow, my fake testicles!

02:18.944 --> 02:20.978
Well, then I guess I'm
not in the league.

02:21.045 --> 02:22.212
I guess I quit.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.381
What?

02:23.448 --> 02:24.615
Deuces.

02:24.683 --> 02:26.183
You're quitting?

02:26.251 --> 02:27.551
Quit?

02:27.619 --> 02:30.554
Kevin, I had another
accident in the suit.

02:30.622 --> 02:33.090
This one's worse
than McGibblets.

02:33.157 --> 02:34.091
Hey!

02:34.158 --> 02:35.158
What's happening, fellas?

02:35.159 --> 02:36.093
Hey.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.093
Nothing that interests you.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.095
You're not in the
league anymore.

02:39.162 --> 02:41.197
Can't I just hang
out with my bros?

02:41.265 --> 02:43.199
Your feigned disinterest
is bullshit.

02:45.803 --> 02:48.505
Top Groom reporting for duty.

02:48.572 --> 02:49.506
Oh, boy.

02:49.573 --> 02:51.574
That's right, it's me, Maverick,
with a very important

02:51.642 --> 02:53.609
message to RSVP to
my wedding, okay?

02:53.676 --> 02:56.612
You guys are the only people who
have not RSVP'd to the wedding.

02:56.679 --> 02:59.548
Because of that, your selection of
avatars is gonna be pretty bad, so...

02:59.616 --> 03:01.450
We're not doing wedding avatars.

03:01.518 --> 03:03.419
We really don't want to have
anything to do with this.

03:03.486 --> 03:04.420
Why are you doing this in L.A.

03:04.487 --> 03:05.421
anyway, by the way?

03:05.488 --> 03:08.390
Uh, because Trixie's a huge fan
of old Hollywood, and I am a

03:08.457 --> 03:10.558
huge fan of
destination weddings.

03:10.626 --> 03:11.459
<i>Top Groom</i> is old Hollywood?

03:11.527 --> 03:12.460
Totally.

03:12.528 --> 03:14.462
But I get where all
this is coming from.

03:14.530 --> 03:17.465
Even though I'm getting married, I'm gonna
be there for you a thousand percent.

03:17.533 --> 03:18.466
You know what?

03:18.534 --> 03:19.467
Let's take it easy.

03:19.535 --> 03:20.468
I think 30% is fine.

03:20.536 --> 03:23.137
I'll take 20% and zero
percent on weekends, please.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.739
No, I'm giving you guys my all.

03:25.807 --> 03:30.343
That's why I designated a room
in my house to be my man cave.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.445
That's right.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.314
How many dudes can you fit
inside your man cave?

03:34.381 --> 03:37.751
Normally like four, but I could
probably fit about six or seven.

03:37.819 --> 03:40.986
I bet you could stuff a bunch of dudes
in that cave if the entrance is right.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.422
Ideally I'd have men coming
in and out all day long.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.623
What's inside the man cave?

03:44.691 --> 03:45.624
Is there carpeting?

03:45.692 --> 03:46.759
Nope, all hard wood.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.795
The man cave is all about
hardcore fun action.

03:49.863 --> 03:53.198
But what if a dude wants to, like,
leave a cream pie in your man cave?

03:53.266 --> 03:54.467
Oh, my God, I would love it.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.634
I'd actually request all of you
bring cream pies to my man cave,

03:56.702 --> 03:58.636
'cause you know I
got a sweet tooth.

03:58.704 --> 04:00.572
Oh, we got a message from Ted.

04:00.639 --> 04:01.639
Ooh, nice.

04:01.707 --> 04:02.640
Video message.

04:02.708 --> 04:03.641
All right, Ted, what you got?

04:03.709 --> 04:05.510
Can you move that bottle
so I can see the screen?

04:05.578 --> 04:06.444
No, this is league business.

04:06.512 --> 04:07.445
It doesn't concern you.

04:07.513 --> 04:08.813
I say we let him watch.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.883
Behold, your champion.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.484
I thought Ted was black.

04:13.551 --> 04:15.986
I haven't seen you all in a
while, but what better way to

04:16.053 --> 04:19.422
reconnect than by you all
kissing my perfectly tanned,

04:19.491 --> 04:22.158
Californian championship ass.

04:22.226 --> 04:24.628
Well, at least he's
still a cocky dick.

04:24.696 --> 04:26.663
I don't remember him being
that good with sand.

04:26.731 --> 04:29.665
Now, you're not gonna get
ripped like me by working out

04:29.733 --> 04:30.900
only five minutes a day.

04:30.968 --> 04:36.939
And you're not gonna get rich like me
by working only five minutes a day.

04:37.007 --> 04:40.476
But you can win a fantasy league
filled with a bunch of idiots by

04:40.544 --> 04:43.846
spending only five
minutes a day.

04:43.914 --> 04:45.714
Honestly, winning was so simple.

04:45.781 --> 04:47.716
The only thing easier
is Andre's sister.

04:47.783 --> 04:48.717
Come on.

04:48.784 --> 04:49.718
She's such a slut.

04:49.785 --> 04:52.721
The Ted draft will be
held in California.

04:52.788 --> 04:53.688
California?

04:53.756 --> 04:55.690
So I will see you all
in Cali, bitches.

04:55.758 --> 04:57.158
Learn how to draft.

04:57.226 --> 05:00.061
California, a little sunshine, and by
the way, there's already something that

05:00.129 --> 05:01.128
we have to do in California.

05:01.195 --> 05:02.195
The wedding thing, right?

05:02.196 --> 05:03.130
Uh-huh, a little combo?

05:03.197 --> 05:05.599
Oh, yeah...
Destination draft.

05:05.667 --> 05:06.627
No, destination wedding.

05:06.668 --> 05:07.601
Destination draft.

05:07.669 --> 05:08.602
It sounds better.

05:08.670 --> 05:09.603
Yeah.

05:09.671 --> 05:10.470
Ruxin, what do you think?

05:10.539 --> 05:12.472
Well, I'll probably go to the
wedding, but I'm not in the

05:12.541 --> 05:14.541
league, I don't really give
a shit about the draft.

05:14.543 --> 05:15.904
Yeah, right, right,
you don't care.

05:15.954 --> 05:17.721
Ruxin, remember to
pick your avatar.

05:17.789 --> 05:19.723
Groot is still available.

05:19.791 --> 05:22.592
Well, what do you mean you don't
have room in your league?

05:22.660 --> 05:27.731
Right, that's why a 13-person
league would be awesome.

05:27.799 --> 05:28.899
You know what?

05:28.967 --> 05:31.935
I'm glad I fired you
last month, Neil.

05:32.002 --> 05:34.404
Go suck a D.

05:36.473 --> 05:39.909
Yeah, I'm in.

05:39.977 --> 05:41.010
Buddy, for real?

05:41.078 --> 05:43.579
Yeah, I'll be in your
Domination League.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.581
Ah, bro, you are not
gonna regret this.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.609
You are gonna love being
in the Domination League.

05:47.651 --> 05:48.583
Right, right, right.

05:48.651 --> 05:50.618
Hey, man, where's
your toilet paper?

05:50.686 --> 05:52.421
Wait, are you in my
house right now?

05:52.488 --> 05:53.422
Yes, I'm in your house?

05:53.489 --> 05:55.424
Are you in the guest bathroom?

05:55.491 --> 05:56.291
Master bathroom.

05:56.359 --> 05:58.226
Why didn't you use
the guest bathroom?

05:58.294 --> 05:59.161
'Cause I'm family?

05:59.228 --> 06:00.868
Oh, you know what?

06:00.988 --> 06:02.823
I'll just used this monogrammed
toilet paper that's here.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.424
No, Rafi, those are monogrammed
towels I got for my wedding!

06:05.491 --> 06:08.125
Oh, God, it's like wiping peanut
butter out of a shag carpet.

06:13.163 --> 06:14.681
We want this cake to pop.

06:14.801 --> 06:17.035
People are sick and tired
of cakes that are sweet.

06:17.102 --> 06:18.169
Right.

06:18.237 --> 06:19.170
Yes, sweet is old fashioned.

06:19.238 --> 06:20.204
It is passé.

06:20.272 --> 06:22.573
We want to do something
that people will remember.

06:22.641 --> 06:24.708
You guys, I have some bad news.

06:24.776 --> 06:26.877
We're not gonna be able to do
the remote controlled flying

06:26.945 --> 06:29.112
cake that dogfights and
shoots chocolate bullets.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.114
When were you gonna
tell us this?

06:31.182 --> 06:33.116
When did you think
to tell us this?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.118
Right now, I thought
would be a good time.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.220
I just... What are we gonna do now?
I feel... Wait a second.

06:38.288 --> 06:39.221
I'm getting an idea.

06:39.289 --> 06:43.292
What if we have a cake that you cut
open and inside... there's a cake.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.327
No, a pie.

06:44.394 --> 06:47.396
No... 
Donuts!

06:47.465 --> 06:48.397
Oh!

06:48.466 --> 06:50.834
I'll check and see if that's
something that we can do, and

06:50.901 --> 06:51.835
I'll get a couple more samples.

06:51.902 --> 06:52.835
You're so smart.

06:52.902 --> 06:53.836
You're so smart.

06:53.903 --> 06:57.473
Wait, um, before I go, any
allergies I should be aware of?

06:57.540 --> 06:59.307
No.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.342
No.

07:00.409 --> 07:02.143
Great. Thanks.

07:02.211 --> 07:04.746
Can we have some
real talk for a sec?

07:04.814 --> 07:05.781
Absolutely.

07:05.849 --> 07:08.130
I'm a little stressed out about
this whole best man thing.

07:08.184 --> 07:10.351
So I was thinking about maybe
doing, like, a <i>Bachelor</i> style

07:10.418 --> 07:12.353
competition... Oh!

07:12.420 --> 07:14.121
...to figure out who
the best man could be.

07:14.189 --> 07:15.189
I love that.

07:15.256 --> 07:16.056
And people love competition.

07:16.124 --> 07:18.626
I'm so glad that I was able
to jump that idea off you.

07:18.694 --> 07:19.694
Well, I love you.

07:19.761 --> 07:20.561
I love you.

07:20.629 --> 07:21.362
Infinity.

07:21.429 --> 07:23.397
You know, I was actually
thinking maybe we could even

07:23.465 --> 07:26.900
have the draft over the wedding
weekend, all the guys, everybody.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.301
Mm-mm, mm-mm, no.

07:28.369 --> 07:32.305
No, this is our special, happy,
wonderful wedding weekend.

07:32.373 --> 07:33.106
We're getting married.

07:33.173 --> 07:35.141
You're not getting
married to your league.

07:35.209 --> 07:36.109
No.

07:36.176 --> 07:38.211
You're right, I won't,
we won't have the draft.

07:38.278 --> 07:38.979
Mm.

07:39.046 --> 07:39.846
I promise.

07:39.914 --> 07:41.279
Thank you. Ooh, what's this?!

07:41.347 --> 07:45.250
So this is a hamachi crudo cake...
Hello.

07:45.318 --> 07:46.084
...with salmon roe.

07:46.152 --> 07:48.253
Mmm!

07:48.321 --> 07:51.123
Ooh! That wasabi?

07:51.190 --> 07:52.157
Yeah.

07:52.225 --> 07:53.425
Wow, a fish cake.

07:53.493 --> 07:56.794
That's really... Still
burns a little bit.

07:56.862 --> 07:59.631
Babe, people are
gonna love this.

07:59.698 --> 08:03.100
Bad news. I talked to Trixie, and she
vetoed the draft for wedding weekend.

08:03.168 --> 08:04.289
She doesn't have that power.

08:04.336 --> 08:05.202
Absolutely not. No!

08:05.270 --> 08:06.203
No.

08:06.271 --> 08:07.192
We're having the draft.

08:07.205 --> 08:08.973
Ted wants to have the
draft in California.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.241
That's where we're having it.

08:10.308 --> 08:11.175
Yeah, but I'm the groom.

08:11.243 --> 08:13.343
Yeah, but Shiva Bowl
champion trumps groom.

08:13.411 --> 08:14.244
Every time.

08:14.311 --> 08:14.912
Second?

08:14.979 --> 08:17.380
That does not... Come on. But you're
putting me in a really uncomfortable

08:17.448 --> 08:18.148
position here.

08:18.215 --> 08:18.782
Just relax, okay?

08:18.850 --> 08:19.550
It's very simple.

08:19.617 --> 08:21.284
Friday night is the
bachelor party.

08:21.352 --> 08:23.253
Guess who's not gonna be
at the bachelor party?

08:23.320 --> 08:24.287
Ah, Andre.

08:24.355 --> 08:25.321
No. Trixie.

08:25.389 --> 08:27.925
So we can draft there, and
she won't know about it.

08:27.992 --> 08:28.925
Secret draft.

08:28.992 --> 08:29.926
Yeah.

08:29.993 --> 08:30.793
No, no, no, guys.

08:30.861 --> 08:33.162
That bachelorette party is at
the exact same time, so...

08:33.229 --> 08:36.933
So it looks like we'll be drafting while
you have to have sex with Trixie.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.933
What?

08:38.001 --> 08:40.162
There isn't gonna be any sex
at the bachelorette party.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.039
>I've had sex at every bachelorette
party I've ever been to.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.206
Oh, uh, film it.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.139
You'll want those memories.

08:45.207 --> 08:46.374
Good call.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.442
Oh.

08:47.509 --> 08:48.643
To the secret draft.

08:48.711 --> 08:49.711
Secret draft.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.181
Ooh... Fine, but I'm not
that comfortable with this.

08:53.248 --> 08:55.483
Ah, who gives a shit?

08:55.551 --> 08:57.652
So, Andre, what's going on?

08:57.720 --> 08:58.801
Why the last-minute invite?

09:00.056 --> 09:02.122
This best man thing
has been killing me.

09:02.190 --> 09:03.223
Where is everybody else?

09:03.291 --> 09:04.558
But I made a decision.

09:04.626 --> 09:05.793
Oh, no, no, get up.

09:05.860 --> 09:06.627
Get up, please.

09:06.695 --> 09:11.465
Pete Eckhart, will you be my...
best man?

09:11.532 --> 09:13.266
You're offering me a rose?

09:13.334 --> 09:14.267
It's not a rose.

09:14.335 --> 09:15.970
It's a brose.

09:16.037 --> 09:18.304
And this is a broposal.

09:18.371 --> 09:21.708
Oh, Andre, I am <i>so</i> flattered.

09:21.775 --> 09:24.276
And as much as I would love to
be your best man, believe me,

09:24.344 --> 09:29.015
nothing would bring me more joy...
I just think about the other guys.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.817
I mean, how would <i>they</i> feel?

09:30.884 --> 09:33.218
There could be a lot of
hurt feelings, Andre.

09:33.285 --> 09:34.653
A lot of jealousy.

09:34.721 --> 09:38.123
We all love you so much.

09:38.190 --> 09:42.327
And that's why I think it would
be prudent if you chose Taco.

09:42.394 --> 09:43.328
Pete.

09:43.395 --> 09:44.229
Ruxin.

09:44.296 --> 09:45.330
Kevin.

09:45.397 --> 09:46.732
You're so wise.

09:46.799 --> 09:49.299
Yeah.

09:52.037 --> 09:54.538
Good talk.

09:54.606 --> 09:59.043
Andre... I will
be your best man.

09:59.111 --> 10:00.277
What?

10:00.345 --> 10:04.248
Yeah. That way, you can go back to the
guys and say, "I couldn't possibly pick

10:04.315 --> 10:07.884
between the four of you,
so I went with Jenny."

10:07.952 --> 10:08.753
That's a great idea.

10:08.786 --> 10:09.719
Yeah.

10:09.787 --> 10:11.888
Then none of my
bros will be upset.

10:11.956 --> 10:12.922
Right.

10:12.990 --> 10:17.994
Instead of my goose, you're gonna be...
my gander.

10:18.062 --> 10:19.328
Yeah.

10:19.396 --> 10:20.429
This is gonna be fun.

10:20.497 --> 10:21.930
Not for you, but for me.

10:21.998 --> 10:24.232
For you, it's gonna be
a lot of hard work.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.902
No, I mean, I think I... the
day of, I just stand there

10:26.970 --> 10:28.137
and I give you the ring.

10:28.204 --> 10:31.573
I help with the bachelor party and...
Sex tips? I need 'em.

10:31.641 --> 10:32.708
Dirty stuff.

10:32.776 --> 10:34.743
Oh, God.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:44.053 --> 10:46.253
Nice sweats, Gander.

10:46.321 --> 10:48.355
Stop looking at my ass, Ruxin.

10:48.423 --> 10:51.458
Los Angeles-- loosely
translated to "Lost Angels."

10:51.526 --> 10:53.827
And this weekend is gonna
be a Andre spectacular.

10:53.895 --> 10:57.297
I'm talking about performance art,
I'm talking about a gypsy carnival.

10:57.364 --> 10:58.298
Oh, what is this?

10:58.365 --> 10:58.865
Whoa!

10:58.933 --> 10:59.632
Hey!

10:59.701 --> 11:00.734
Hey, guys. How are ya?!

11:00.802 --> 11:01.668
Good to see you.

11:01.736 --> 11:03.003
Good to see you, man!

11:03.071 --> 11:03.837
How are ya, Taco?

11:03.905 --> 11:06.973
Ted used to just crush
ass in high school.

11:07.041 --> 11:07.874
I did.

11:07.942 --> 11:09.241
We called him "lady killer."

11:09.309 --> 11:09.975
I did. Crushed.

11:10.043 --> 11:10.876
Crushed 'em. Hey, Sacko.

11:11.945 --> 11:12.785
How you doing, buddy?

11:12.846 --> 11:13.612
I'm not The Sacko.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.714
I'm not in the league.

11:14.781 --> 11:15.480
Oh, really?

11:15.548 --> 11:16.281
Yeah.

11:16.349 --> 11:17.282
It's a shame.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.418
He's gonna miss a hell of a draft...
and bachelor party.

11:19.485 --> 11:20.652
Draft on the down low.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.088
Uh, everyone, cheers, please.

11:22.155 --> 11:22.855
Wow.

11:22.923 --> 11:24.123
Thank you so much, Ted.

11:24.191 --> 11:25.123
Bubbly.

11:25.191 --> 11:26.124
You look amazing.

11:26.192 --> 11:27.325
What have you been up to?

11:27.392 --> 11:28.292
Yeah!

11:28.360 --> 11:29.493
Thank you. Thanks.

11:29.561 --> 11:30.494
Just, uh, clean living.

11:30.562 --> 11:31.462
Lost, you know, 72 pounds.

11:31.530 --> 11:32.463
Whoa.

11:32.531 --> 11:34.065
I mean, what's
going on with you?

11:34.133 --> 11:35.633
You come out here,
you get all skinny.

11:35.701 --> 11:37.802
You don't come visit
us in Chicago.

11:37.870 --> 11:41.004
Well, no, I've had a crazy few years,
and I actually wanted to tell you

11:41.072 --> 11:42.005
about it.

11:42.073 --> 11:43.073
Um, I have AIDS.

11:44.342 --> 11:45.843
Seriously, I do.

11:45.910 --> 11:46.643
Oh.

11:46.711 --> 11:48.112
Lady killer, huh?

11:48.179 --> 11:49.312
No.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.148
Wait-- you have AIDS or HIV?

11:51.216 --> 11:52.449
No, no, I <i>had</i> HIV.

11:52.516 --> 11:54.351
Now I have AIDS.

11:54.418 --> 11:55.385
Full-blownsies?

11:55.453 --> 11:56.720
Yep.

11:56.787 --> 11:57.620
I'm so sorry, Ted.

11:57.687 --> 11:59.588
Uh... Not a big deal.

11:59.656 --> 12:00.957
I'm the same Ted, all right?

12:01.024 --> 12:02.792
I'm feeling great, I've
been taking my cocktail.

12:02.860 --> 12:03.559
So everything's good.

12:03.627 --> 12:05.261
Honestly, I've
never felt better.

12:05.328 --> 12:08.430
I just want you to know that,
as a doctor, if you ever need

12:08.498 --> 12:12.201
anything, I am more than happy to...
Andre, AIDS doesn't need a calf implant.

12:13.070 --> 12:13.902
Everything's fine. Cheers!

12:13.970 --> 12:15.170
Okay.

12:15.238 --> 12:16.405
To AIDS.

12:16.473 --> 12:17.439
To forgetting about it.

12:17.507 --> 12:18.428
To forgetting about it.

12:18.475 --> 12:19.341
What AIDS, right?

12:19.409 --> 12:20.909
I drank out of all
those glasses.

12:20.977 --> 12:21.910
Mm!

12:21.978 --> 12:23.145
What?

12:23.212 --> 12:25.581
Okay, that's... What?

12:25.649 --> 12:26.749
I'm kidding! I'm kidding.

12:26.816 --> 12:29.417
I think it's awesome
that you have AIDS.

12:29.485 --> 12:32.287
I mean, you get to use that
special lane on the highway.

12:32.354 --> 12:33.354
Oh, no, that's HOV.

12:33.422 --> 12:35.222
Ah, HOV.

12:35.291 --> 12:36.571
Now that's the disease you want.

12:37.526 --> 12:38.459
Whoa-whoa! Whoa!

12:38.527 --> 12:39.527
Oh, shit.

12:39.595 --> 12:42.363
Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo!

12:44.266 --> 12:46.065
You invited Rafi
to your wedding?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.167
No, I didn't.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.302
He found out about it.

12:48.369 --> 12:49.369
Ooh-ooh! Rafi's here!

12:49.437 --> 12:50.370
Hey.

12:50.438 --> 12:51.571
Take this to my room.

12:51.639 --> 12:53.340
Oh, Jesus! Don't...

12:53.408 --> 12:54.308
What'd I miss?

12:54.375 --> 12:55.509
Sorry I'm late.

12:55.576 --> 12:58.312
Ruxin made fun of Andre's
shirt and Ted has AIDS.

12:58.379 --> 12:59.180
Nice shirt.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.246
Seriously? Wait a minute. What?

13:00.315 --> 13:01.414
Yeah.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.402
Dude, you got the AIDS?

13:02.416 --> 13:03.282
Yep.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.284
I'm about to do you
a real solid here.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.251
All right.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.187
Every morning, take a
baby aspirin, okay?

13:08.254 --> 13:09.454
If you're gonna fly, take two.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.289
That's it?

13:10.357 --> 13:13.626
Boom. That shit will
be gone in a month.

13:21.545 --> 13:22.712
Yes! Welcome!

13:22.779 --> 13:23.619
Who's ready to draft?

13:23.670 --> 13:24.937
Wow, Ted, amazing.

13:25.005 --> 13:25.838
Good to see you.

13:25.906 --> 13:26.906
Yeah.

13:26.973 --> 13:30.209
Ladies, uh, could we, uh, get
my friends lubricated, please?

13:30.277 --> 13:31.277
Thank you.

13:31.345 --> 13:33.746
Well, nothing says bachelor
draft like scantily clad women

13:33.813 --> 13:34.773
in Sticker Bitch shirts.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.216
Yes. Guys... What?

13:37.284 --> 13:39.284
...this is supposed
to be a secret draft.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.220
Andre, it says "Secret
fantasy draft."

13:42.288 --> 13:44.356
Bold letters just screaming it.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.558
I know, but everyone
will know it's a secret.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.345
Secret draft!

13:47.360 --> 13:48.026
Secret draft!

13:48.094 --> 13:49.027
Quiet! Shh! Quiet!

13:49.095 --> 13:50.295
Come on, please!

13:50.363 --> 13:51.629
Okay, so are we all here?

13:51.697 --> 13:52.630
Are we ready?

13:52.698 --> 13:55.199
Uh, yeah, Chuck's in
rehab again, though.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.134
Well, that just leaves... What?

13:57.202 --> 13:58.135
Sir?

13:58.203 --> 13:59.002
What?

13:59.071 --> 14:00.904
Would you like to join
us for the draft?

14:00.972 --> 14:01.812
Oh, I'm not drafting.

14:01.839 --> 14:04.575
I'm not participating in the
fantasy football league this year.

14:04.642 --> 14:07.578
Really? You're gonna stand five feet
from us and you're not gonna draft?

14:07.645 --> 14:09.580
Yeah, I'm in Los Angeles to
celebrate the union of the two

14:09.647 --> 14:11.847
classiest, most
tasteful people I know.

14:11.915 --> 14:12.848
Hey!

14:12.916 --> 14:13.849
Yeah.

14:13.917 --> 14:14.850
You are so full of it.

14:14.918 --> 14:16.852
I'll be at the bar
drinking alone.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.889
Guys, he's really missing out because
this is gonna be a draft to remember.

14:19.957 --> 14:20.923
I guarantee you.

14:20.991 --> 14:21.724
There he is.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.059
What?

14:23.127 --> 14:25.528
You guys are familiar with the
bone-crushing power of the

14:25.596 --> 14:27.629
2012 Defensive Player
of the Year J.J. Watt?

14:27.697 --> 14:28.630
Yeah.

14:28.698 --> 14:29.631
He's the bachelor, huh?

14:29.699 --> 14:30.432
That's the guy.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.433
Uh, indeed I am.

14:31.501 --> 14:34.069
I've seen, uh, a lot of bachelor
party punishments in my

14:34.137 --> 14:36.305
day, and this is the worst,
the worst I've seen.

14:36.372 --> 14:38.940
Okay, first of all, it's not a
punishment, and I'll have you

14:39.008 --> 14:41.543
know it's part of the Rob
Kardashian collection, so yeah.

14:41.611 --> 14:44.479
Oh, that's why you look like a
blind kid at his first rave.

14:44.546 --> 14:45.513
Drinks are here.

14:45.581 --> 14:46.647
Everyone drink up.

14:46.715 --> 14:49.283
The champion declares this
draft party in session.

14:49.351 --> 14:50.284
Thank you.

14:50.352 --> 14:51.385
Very generous.

14:51.453 --> 14:54.155
Ted is just hanging out with J.J.
Watt like it's a normal

14:54.223 --> 14:55.556
thing, like they're friends.

14:55.624 --> 14:58.226
I got to say Ted has
improved somehow.

14:58.293 --> 15:00.160
Full-blown Ted has a
better life than we have.

15:00.194 --> 15:02.195
Kevin, he has AIDS.

15:02.263 --> 15:03.196
We should be so lucky.

15:03.264 --> 15:05.298
Yeah, I would like the
AIDS-vantage that Ted has.

15:05.366 --> 15:06.299
Now, let's face it.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.968
Full-blown Ted's got a less
restricted sex life than Andre.

15:09.036 --> 15:10.203
To Ted.

15:10.271 --> 15:11.138
Ted!

15:11.205 --> 15:12.305
I'll drink to that.

15:12.373 --> 15:16.742
What's this-- a dumb dildo convention?

15:16.809 --> 15:18.744
Where are you pulling
these hot dogs from?

15:18.811 --> 15:19.745
Pocket dogs.

15:19.812 --> 15:21.614
I always got a hot dog in
my pocket-- you want one?

15:21.681 --> 15:22.581
I don't want any pocket dogs.

15:22.649 --> 15:23.582
Okay, fine.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.384
I don't even want to
be in this league.

15:25.452 --> 15:26.418
Do you know what I mean?

15:26.486 --> 15:27.253
Who does?

15:27.320 --> 15:29.188
Domination League--
now we're talking.

15:29.256 --> 15:31.156
Now you're playing
with the big boys.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.157
Yeah.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.225
Speaking of... Mm-hmm.

15:34.293 --> 15:36.261
You're not posting at all
on the message board.

15:36.328 --> 15:37.328
Everybody's freaking out.

15:37.363 --> 15:39.597
Rafi, from what I can tell, the
message board is just a chat

15:39.665 --> 15:40.998
room for a bondage Web site.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.300
You're not wrong.

15:42.368 --> 15:44.068
What is that?

15:44.136 --> 15:46.337
Oh, good, you brought the drugs.

15:46.405 --> 15:48.805
No, this is Ted's AIDS cocktail.

15:48.873 --> 15:51.141
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I put
two and two together.

15:51.209 --> 15:53.677
That guy doesn't win a
championship for eight years,

15:53.744 --> 15:56.513
and then he starts to take these
little babies and wins one, huh?

15:56.581 --> 15:58.448
Do we all see what's
going on here?

15:58.516 --> 16:00.050
Please, do not take those.

16:00.117 --> 16:01.077
Oh, I already took them.

16:01.118 --> 16:02.052
What?

16:02.119 --> 16:03.053
Yeah, I ate a whole bag full.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.420
A lot.

16:04.488 --> 16:05.421
Okay.

16:05.489 --> 16:06.422
Okay, okay, okay.

16:06.490 --> 16:09.091
Are we ready to start the
next year of my championship?

16:09.159 --> 16:10.059
Ruxin, last chance.

16:10.126 --> 16:11.060
Are you in or out?

16:11.127 --> 16:12.061
I'm out like white blazers.

16:12.128 --> 16:12.828
Nice one, man.

16:12.896 --> 16:13.829
Up top.

16:13.897 --> 16:14.830
I'll never touch your hand.

16:14.898 --> 16:15.898
Yeah, that's a good call.

16:15.899 --> 16:17.833
There's something really
messed up with my nails.

16:17.901 --> 16:18.834
I'll just manage two teams.

16:18.902 --> 16:20.902
You're not taking Ruxin's spot.

16:20.969 --> 16:21.903
No, no, no, you guys.

16:21.970 --> 16:22.904
Come on.

16:22.971 --> 16:23.905
Look who you're dealing with.

16:23.972 --> 16:24.692
I took care of it.

16:24.740 --> 16:25.674
What?

16:25.741 --> 16:26.675
Is he gonna do it for real?

16:26.742 --> 16:27.542
He's gonna do it.

16:27.610 --> 16:29.477
How many teams are
we working with?

16:29.545 --> 16:31.313
We're rocking... We're solid.

16:31.380 --> 16:32.146
We keep it tight, you know?

16:32.215 --> 16:33.147
...eight.

16:33.216 --> 16:34.115
Eight?

16:34.183 --> 16:35.149
That's pretty weak.

16:35.217 --> 16:36.149
But I'll do it.

16:36.218 --> 16:37.150
Yeah!

16:37.219 --> 16:38.352
Yes!

16:38.420 --> 16:40.120
J.J. Watt!

16:40.188 --> 16:43.190
Aw, man, I don't
know who that is.

16:43.258 --> 16:46.960
As the Sacko commmmissioner, I would
like to propose one rule change.

16:47.061 --> 16:49.896
I know we all love the name of
our beloved Sacko trophy, but I

16:49.964 --> 16:53.099
have discovered one name that is
is even more symbolic of that

16:53.166 --> 16:54.934
which you do not want to be.

16:55.001 --> 16:58.471
I give you... the Ruxin.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.473
What?

17:00.541 --> 17:01.941
Oh, my God!

17:02.008 --> 17:03.075
That is horrible.

17:03.143 --> 17:04.076
Look at that.

17:04.144 --> 17:06.078
Oh, my God, you captured
his vinegar strokes.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.079
With an ode to his herdsmanship.

17:08.146 --> 17:10.949
Wait, why is there a statue of
Joe Paterno with my name on it?

17:11.016 --> 17:12.951
Here, come here, let me hold it.

17:13.018 --> 17:13.952
Here you go.

17:14.019 --> 17:15.185
Oh, man.

17:15.255 --> 17:16.255
Yeah, I don't touch that.

17:16.256 --> 17:18.522
Joke's on you because I'm
the one who's cumming.

17:18.590 --> 17:20.692
It looks like his
head sat in gum.

17:20.760 --> 17:25.363
When you're in a Domination League,
we're talking 12 teams, PPR.

17:25.430 --> 17:29.099
This is a keeper league, so if
you got a QB you like, you got a

17:29.167 --> 17:32.102
cute girl that one of us knows, you
want to keep her, you're allowed.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.138
All right, you're up, J.J.

17:34.205 --> 17:36.206
First pick for Ruxin,
make it pretty.

17:36.275 --> 17:38.142
I think this team needs a
defense, and I think it's gonna

17:38.209 --> 17:39.143
be the Houston defense.

17:39.210 --> 17:40.143
Yes!

17:40.210 --> 17:42.612
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

17:42.680 --> 17:44.113
Yes, defense!

17:44.181 --> 17:46.215
No, no, no, you animal!

17:46.284 --> 17:48.551
You got a problem
with the Houston D?

17:48.619 --> 17:50.482
No, I don't have a problem
with the Houston D.

17:50.754 --> 17:51.687
You know, I think J.J.

17:51.755 --> 17:54.623
doesn't have too much time, so
we should let him just take his

17:54.691 --> 17:55.623
second round pick.

17:55.691 --> 17:56.624
Cool, cool, cool.

17:56.692 --> 17:58.227
Hey, Blaire, come on in.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.828
Hey, what's up?

17:59.896 --> 18:00.863
How you doing, man?

18:00.930 --> 18:01.864
Good to see you.

18:01.931 --> 18:03.866
Blair Walsh, kicker for
the Minnesota Vikings.

18:03.933 --> 18:04.666
Of course.

18:04.734 --> 18:05.868
Close, personal friend.

18:05.935 --> 18:06.935
Go ahead, take a pick, pal.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.204
First pick in the second round.

18:09.272 --> 18:10.805
What does this team need?

18:10.873 --> 18:12.039
Adrian Peterson probably.

18:12.107 --> 18:13.407
I think maybe the kicker.

18:13.475 --> 18:14.808
Yes!

18:14.877 --> 18:16.911
How about Blair Walsh?

18:16.979 --> 18:18.812
No... no!

18:18.881 --> 18:21.582
A defense in the first round,
a kicker in the second round?

18:21.649 --> 18:22.583
This is insane!

18:22.650 --> 18:23.771
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

18:23.785 --> 18:25.785
Oh, that's right, you're
not in the league anymore.

18:25.820 --> 18:26.754
Fine!

18:26.821 --> 18:27.754
I will do whatever you want.

18:27.821 --> 18:28.755
I will rejoin the league, okay?

18:28.822 --> 18:32.959
Okay, but you are going to
take that team as it is.

18:33.027 --> 18:36.529
Fine, I'll still
whip all your asses.

18:36.597 --> 18:38.798
Even with the Houston D and
the Blair Kick Project here.

18:38.832 --> 18:41.902
Not before you do your
Sacko punishments.

18:41.969 --> 18:43.435
Recognize this guy?

18:43.503 --> 18:44.937
Hey.

18:45.005 --> 18:45.938
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:46.006 --> 18:46.738
Wait a second.

18:46.806 --> 18:48.507
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

18:48.574 --> 18:50.575
I'm going to rejoin my league.

18:50.643 --> 18:51.377
Excuse me?

18:51.444 --> 18:53.245
Because last I checked,
you joined my league!

18:53.313 --> 18:55.147
Yeah, and I'm unjoining
your league.

18:55.215 --> 18:57.149
You can't unjoin the
Domination League!

18:57.217 --> 18:59.083
You have sworn yourself to
the hands of these people!

18:59.151 --> 19:00.151
So what?

19:00.219 --> 19:01.886
I vouched for you, okay?

19:01.954 --> 19:03.354
This looks bad on me!

19:03.422 --> 19:05.756
This dishonors me, and
all I have is my honor!

19:05.824 --> 19:07.926
Oh, right, you're like
a samurai, huh, Rafi?

19:07.993 --> 19:08.927
I am a samurai!

19:08.994 --> 19:13.697
Rafi, your toilet and your goddamn
kitchen occupy the same metal tub.

19:13.765 --> 19:16.533
Just like a samurai!

19:18.136 --> 19:19.869
These things itch.

19:19.938 --> 19:22.372
Things I do for my friends.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.307
It's just ridiculous.

19:23.374 --> 19:25.566
Oh, my God!

19:29.046 --> 19:30.884
Yeah, you got Ruxin.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.574
I'll do whatever you guys want.

19:32.694 --> 19:35.943
Just, Andre, keep your hands
away from my tush, okay?

19:36.191 --> 19:37.711
No promises.

19:37.778 --> 19:40.213
Who's that?

19:44.617 --> 19:45.584
What the hell is this?

19:45.652 --> 19:48.153
What the hell?

19:48.221 --> 19:50.823
Welcome to the
Domination League.

19:51.367 --> 19:52.467
We doing the draft?

19:52.535 --> 19:53.501
No, we're not doing a draft.

19:53.569 --> 19:54.964
It's a league meeting.

19:55.084 --> 19:56.986
Jesus, Spazinelli, we told
you it's obviously not the

19:57.053 --> 19:58.921
draft-- we don't have
gerbils or hot sauce.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.789
We have nothing, I mean... 
We don't have anything.

20:01.857 --> 20:03.825
We should
use our deeper voices.

20:03.893 --> 20:04.953
Yeah, use the deep voices, guys.

20:05.074 --> 20:06.874
I think the deep voices are
only when we have the masks on.

20:06.942 --> 20:09.543
Well, we didn't... No one clarified
it before... The masks are...

20:09.611 --> 20:12.479
...exactly how we were gonna do it...
You're Dirty Randy.

20:12.547 --> 20:13.480
Yeah!

20:13.548 --> 20:14.281
Wait, Russell?

20:14.349 --> 20:15.282
Yes, it's me.

20:15.350 --> 20:18.018
No, it's a porcelain
murder doll.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.053
You guys, I'm not in
the Domination League.

20:20.121 --> 20:23.890
Oh, but you are in the
Domination League.

20:23.958 --> 20:26.693
The only way to get out
of this league is to die.

20:26.761 --> 20:27.794
Or be killed.

20:27.862 --> 20:28.795
Bow!

20:28.863 --> 20:29.796
Bloh!

20:29.864 --> 20:30.831
Bow!

20:34.901 --> 20:36.001
You can never leave.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.837
It's like the Hotel California.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.838
Exactly.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.539
But with more teeth and puss.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.175
Wasn't the Hotel California
kind of a sad, puss-y place?

20:43.243 --> 20:46.045
Okay, it's exactly like
the Hotel California.

20:46.113 --> 20:49.080
Only less douchey Don
Henley bullshit.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.381
Do not insult Don Henley!

20:50.449 --> 20:52.416
You guys need to get
your act together!

20:52.484 --> 20:54.685
And until you do, I'm not
gonna be in this league!

20:54.754 --> 20:55.686
You're not going anywhere!

20:55.755 --> 20:57.688
You're not anywhere, pretty boy.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.624
You're not going anywhere,
pretty, pretty boy.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.692
You just checked in...
to the hotel.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.894
Spaz!

21:02.962 --> 21:03.962
Spaz, we moved on.

21:05.130 --> 21:05.863
What is wrong with you?

21:05.930 --> 21:07.831
Everybody, shut up.

21:07.899 --> 21:13.136
Ruxin, you need to be punished for
shunning the Domination League.

21:13.203 --> 21:16.740
Prepare to be hunted.

21:16.807 --> 21:19.242
And then we're gonna skin you
and wear you like a coat.

21:19.310 --> 21:20.543
Chill out, Spaz.

21:20.611 --> 21:21.544
Spaz.

21:21.612 --> 21:23.546
Spazinelli, calm down, these
are just paintball guns.

21:23.614 --> 21:24.381
I'm so confused.

21:24.448 --> 21:26.149
Are we actually gonna
kill him or not?

21:26.216 --> 21:28.083
No, we're not gonna
kill anybody.

21:28.151 --> 21:30.085
Is that a trident
made of dildos?

21:30.153 --> 21:32.721
I do not know what a trident
is, but these are dildos.

21:32.789 --> 21:33.989
Hey, Ruxin.

21:34.056 --> 21:35.624
Run, rabbit, run.

21:35.692 --> 21:37.859
Oh, God, Rafi, please, please!

21:37.927 --> 21:39.127
Make it stop!

21:39.195 --> 21:40.396
It'll stop when you're dead.

21:40.463 --> 21:43.864
Are we using our
deep voices or our normal voices?

21:43.932 --> 21:45.771
I think this one's broken, guys.

21:45.891 --> 21:47.269
Please, no!
