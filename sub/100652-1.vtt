00:11.236 --> 00:12.435
Lights, camera, action.

00:12.437 --> 00:14.471
It's Sam Zander time.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.338
I know what you're
thinkin': what's this?

00:16.341 --> 00:17.775
You'll find out soon
enough, but yeah,

00:17.777 --> 00:19.442
I'm growing the beard out.

00:19.444 --> 00:20.610
So I'm just here at my
parent's house in Malibu.

00:20.612 --> 00:21.946
The look.

00:21.948 --> 00:22.780
Oh.

00:22.782 --> 00:24.214
I'm rich.

00:24.216 --> 00:25.582
Deal with it.

00:25.584 --> 00:28.385
Lots of wine boxes 'cause
my parents are drunks.

00:28.387 --> 00:29.654
Drunks and fat.

00:29.656 --> 00:31.354
Yeah, I shame my
parents, whatever.

00:31.356 --> 00:32.790
This is a message
from Sam Zander.

00:32.792 --> 00:34.557
Do you know where
your children are?

00:34.559 --> 00:36.259
They're on my website,
where you should be.

00:36.261 --> 00:36.961
Yeah, I've been thinkin',
I've been thinkin',

00:36.963 --> 00:37.895
I've been thinkin'.

00:37.897 --> 00:38.696
What does it all mean?

00:38.698 --> 00:39.730
I don't know.

00:39.732 --> 00:41.231
Once upon a time there was a boy

00:41.233 --> 00:42.599
who didn't know
what he was gonna do

00:42.601 --> 00:44.334
so he did something
to change the world.

00:44.336 --> 00:44.935
What are you doing?

00:44.937 --> 00:45.836
Who are you?

00:45.838 --> 00:47.370
Where are we going?

00:49.374 --> 00:50.941
Listen, I want you guys to
know I'm about to something

00:50.943 --> 00:52.743
really courageous for you all.

00:52.745 --> 00:54.310
I'm about to do
something really bold.

00:54.312 --> 00:56.981
Send me your comments below.

00:57.884 --> 00:59.516
Peace up, bash down, ah.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.856
I'm tellin' ya,
Patronies Pizza's goin' under.

01:05.489 --> 01:06.556
Now how would
you know that and I don't?

01:06.558 --> 01:08.324
Trust me.

01:08.326 --> 01:09.727
Knee Cha!

01:09.729 --> 01:11.261
Oh he's probably
canned from being

01:11.263 --> 01:12.863
God's loyal opposition.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.364
So tell me your

01:14.366 --> 01:15.802
- crackpot theory.
- You can't see it?

01:17.602 --> 01:18.903
It always get slow
around this time of the year.

01:18.905 --> 01:19.804
- You know that...
- No, no, no.

01:19.806 --> 01:20.871
It's more than that.

01:20.873 --> 01:21.708
Shalom.

01:25.678 --> 01:27.510
- You're not Jewish.
- Why not?

01:27.512 --> 01:28.913
It doesn't work that way.

01:28.915 --> 01:30.748
My step grandmother was
a German Jew is the 40s.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.615
That should count double
for me, all right?

01:32.617 --> 01:35.452
- It's Saturday.
- That's why we're walking.

01:35.454 --> 01:36.787
So, you're working
on the Sabbath?

01:36.789 --> 01:38.288
I'm culturally
Jewish, all right?

01:38.290 --> 01:40.559
- Give me break, will ya?
- Right, proceed.

01:44.362 --> 01:46.030
Patronies Pizza is going under

01:46.032 --> 01:48.366
because of one small detail.

01:49.736 --> 01:50.703
Single ply.

01:52.471 --> 01:53.838
We went from two
ply to single ply.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.673
Bankruptcy starts
in the bathroom.

01:55.675 --> 01:57.675
You know, I'm
drawing the line here.

01:57.677 --> 02:00.343
As a matter of fact, I
liked you a lot better

02:00.345 --> 02:01.714
when you was practicing Kwanzaa.

02:02.849 --> 02:04.917
That was just a phase.

02:06.719 --> 02:08.018
What do you think?

02:08.020 --> 02:09.652
Listen, this aint
no feel good story

02:09.655 --> 02:11.588
about some pizza joint.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.657
It's about the one
lie we all believe in.

02:13.659 --> 02:15.025
Me?

02:15.027 --> 02:16.827
I'm the happiness
without a reason guy.

02:16.829 --> 02:19.329
My philosophy is you don't
need reasons to be happy.

02:19.331 --> 02:21.699
You only need reasons
to be unhappy.

02:21.701 --> 02:25.803
I know, I know, it
sounds unreasonable.

02:25.805 --> 02:27.972
You see, the whole
human experience is just

02:27.974 --> 02:30.373
a speck of dust in
the blink of time.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.843
And every single one of
us is born incomplete.

02:32.845 --> 02:34.812
We spend our whole lives
searching for meaning

02:34.814 --> 02:36.680
that fills a little
hole in our hearts.

02:36.682 --> 02:40.450
For the eight slices, it's
the name tags we wear,

02:40.452 --> 02:41.886
and whether we're
doing a good job

02:41.888 --> 02:44.955
portraying our favorite
writers who, at some point,

02:44.957 --> 02:46.458
filled that hole in us.

02:47.093 --> 02:47.927
Temporarily.

02:49.561 --> 02:52.863
I do wonder what Kerouac
would think of all this.

02:52.865 --> 02:54.098
Anyway.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.301
All that really matters
is one question:

02:58.070 --> 02:59.672
what makes the perfect pizza?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.814
As an actor,

03:09.816 --> 03:11.782
your freedom happens
between the lines.

03:11.784 --> 03:13.818
What does your character want?

03:13.820 --> 03:15.653
What stands in their way?

03:15.655 --> 03:17.620
These are the two most
important questions

03:17.622 --> 03:19.422
going into the scene.

03:19.424 --> 03:21.759
Self-self-self-self promotion

03:21.761 --> 03:24.897
is 90% of acting in today's
world against a famous...

03:26.132 --> 03:27.834
All right, here we go.

03:28.701 --> 03:29.702
Woo hoo hoo!

03:30.870 --> 03:31.771
America, look at this!

03:33.139 --> 03:36.441
Oh, the things I do
for you.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.180
Really?

03:43.182 --> 03:45.448
Come on, Oscar.

03:45.450 --> 03:46.549
It's just a shirt.

03:46.551 --> 03:47.818
"Come on, Oscar."

03:47.820 --> 03:48.821
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:49.956 --> 03:51.655
It makes people think.

03:51.657 --> 03:54.625
Well I don't want my customers
thinking about anything,

03:54.627 --> 03:56.827
except for how good my pizza is.

03:59.431 --> 04:00.432
Hey Wendy.

04:01.968 --> 04:04.567
So, tell me everything.

04:04.569 --> 04:05.503
How was the campus?

04:06.839 --> 04:08.873
Is college a waste of money?

04:08.875 --> 04:10.875
Only if you're getting a
degree in something practical

04:10.877 --> 04:13.177
- like philosophy.
- I don't even know

04:13.179 --> 04:14.912
if I'll get in.

04:14.914 --> 04:16.779
Would you
do it if it were free?

04:16.781 --> 04:18.214
Anyone would.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.916
Then that's your answer.

04:19.918 --> 04:23.453
Yeah, but I'd get like a
golden toilet if it was free.

04:23.455 --> 04:24.621
What?

04:24.623 --> 04:25.923
- Morning, G.
- Morning, G.

04:30.897 --> 04:32.897
Some locals.

04:32.899 --> 04:34.164
'Sup dude?

04:35.801 --> 04:37.600
Look at this place.

04:37.602 --> 04:38.936
Yo.

04:38.938 --> 04:41.105
We're not in Malibu anymore.

04:41.107 --> 04:42.572
- A
- callback is when

04:42.574 --> 04:44.775
a casting director
wants to see you again.

04:44.777 --> 04:47.811
This is a good indication
that you did something well.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.582
Hey, Ann.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.951
How'd the book tour go?

04:53.953 --> 04:56.619
I didn't even make it
out of Brunswick County.

04:56.621 --> 04:57.655
Hey.

04:57.657 --> 04:58.824
It still counts in my book.

05:00.993 --> 05:01.994
How's Kelli doin'?

05:03.996 --> 05:04.830
Screw Kelli.

05:08.834 --> 05:09.934
Oh hey.

05:09.936 --> 05:11.168
- Mornin'.
- Hey guys.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.870
- Morning.
- Hi.

05:12.872 --> 05:15.473
After this, check
the toilet paper.

05:18.044 --> 05:19.009
Hi, Ann.

05:19.011 --> 05:20.978
How'd the book tour go?

05:23.049 --> 05:24.684
All kinds of hostility today.

05:25.751 --> 05:27.718
Hey man, how's Kelli doin'?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.219
All right, let's get started.

05:30.723 --> 05:32.923
Schopenhauer, nice
of you to join us.

05:32.925 --> 05:34.024
Care to explain yourself?

05:34.026 --> 05:35.558
Uh, sure.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.027
I'm somewhere in this
body, condemned to this

05:37.029 --> 05:38.963
completely indifferent
universe that was created

05:38.965 --> 05:40.530
by someone or from
something that forgot

05:40.532 --> 05:42.166
to put human happiness
in its design.

05:42.168 --> 05:43.067
Amen.

05:43.069 --> 05:44.702
Time is an illusion.

05:44.704 --> 05:46.569
We are the only
creatures on this planet

05:46.571 --> 05:47.972
that keep track of time.

05:47.974 --> 05:50.074
Therefore, we are the
only creatures that

05:50.076 --> 05:51.709
have a fear of time running out.

05:51.711 --> 05:52.676
Exactly!

05:52.678 --> 05:53.877
Just look at Guillermo.

05:53.879 --> 05:55.179
What?

05:55.181 --> 05:56.647
If you believe
in human happiness,

05:56.649 --> 05:57.247
just look at an
old person's face.

05:57.249 --> 05:58.849
Ah, come on.

05:58.851 --> 06:00.918
I mean it, they're
like deeply wrinkled,

06:00.920 --> 06:02.820
permanent displays
of disappointment.

06:02.822 --> 06:04.924
It's just etched in there.

06:05.958 --> 06:07.992
I'm happy without a reason.

06:09.261 --> 06:11.998
I don't need a
reason to be happy!

06:13.966 --> 06:15.598
Going to Patronies.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.667
This is gonna be awesome.

06:16.669 --> 06:17.935
Are you excited?

06:17.937 --> 06:18.669
I'm excited.

06:20.072 --> 06:21.739
All right, all right,
time to get to work.

06:22.708 --> 06:23.640
All right, all right.

06:23.642 --> 06:25.075
Calm down, Jack.

06:25.077 --> 06:26.910
Listen, I brought you
in early today because I...

06:28.214 --> 06:29.749
We are closed.

06:31.117 --> 06:32.950
Read the sign.

06:32.952 --> 06:34.051
It's 10 am.

06:34.053 --> 06:35.786
I thought time
was an illusion.

06:35.788 --> 06:36.619
Schopenhauer.

06:36.621 --> 06:37.254
Look at that.

06:37.256 --> 06:38.689
Oh, shoot.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.960
Hi, welcome to
Patronies, we're closed.

06:43.095 --> 06:44.661
I'm a new hire.

06:44.663 --> 06:46.098
Do we have a new hire today?

06:52.671 --> 06:53.739
For you, sir.

06:59.979 --> 07:01.845
Uh, hi.

07:01.847 --> 07:02.913
I'm uh, I'm John.

07:02.915 --> 07:04.081
I'm the new hire.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.749
Hi, John.

07:05.751 --> 07:06.950
John, pull up a seat.

07:06.952 --> 07:08.719
Join the circle.

07:08.721 --> 07:11.388
I just thought I'd give
you all fair warning.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.058
You should probably start
updating your resumes.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.893
- What?
- Oh no.

07:15.895 --> 07:16.894
Two ply.

07:16.896 --> 07:17.895
It's the toilet paper, man.

07:17.897 --> 07:18.964
That's why we're going under.

07:19.865 --> 07:21.198
Are you seeing this?

07:21.200 --> 07:22.199
Two months ago,
the majority partner

07:22.201 --> 07:25.102
sold their shares back to me,

07:25.104 --> 07:29.039
and uh, we just didn't
have the summer season

07:29.041 --> 07:29.975
I was hoping for.

07:31.644 --> 07:33.844
This is just a
precaution, Knee Cha.

07:33.846 --> 07:34.680
Ann?

07:35.247 --> 07:36.213
All right?

07:36.215 --> 07:37.848
Service stays the same.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.383
Menu's staying simple.

07:39.385 --> 07:41.785
Now attached to your
envelopes are the new

07:41.787 --> 07:43.087
pizza membership program.

07:43.089 --> 07:45.923
Albert will explain
how it's going to work.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.659
Guys, if we each
sell 25 of these,

07:48.661 --> 07:49.426
we'll have enough money to get

07:49.428 --> 07:50.994
us through the winter season

07:50.996 --> 07:52.863
and we won't have to
worry about closing.

07:52.865 --> 07:55.232
At any rate, I hope the
recommendation letters

07:55.234 --> 07:56.102
work for everyone.

07:57.736 --> 07:59.670
John, I'll need to get
to know who you are

07:59.672 --> 08:01.040
before I can write you one.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.077
Well should I even start, or?

08:05.945 --> 08:07.111
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.679
- It's money, ya nuts?
- Yes.

08:08.681 --> 08:09.746
Yeah man,
stay positive, man.

08:09.748 --> 08:10.615
It's up to you.

08:12.017 --> 08:13.283
I hope you guys know
if there's anything

08:13.285 --> 08:15.087
I could have done
differently, I would've.

08:17.923 --> 08:19.823
Oh, 30 minutes before
the doors open.

08:19.825 --> 08:21.091
Let's keep our heads up

08:21.093 --> 08:23.395
and uh, if you
guys need anything,

08:24.363 --> 08:25.364
don't hesitate to ask.

08:28.134 --> 08:29.466
You and me, we're gonna
make it through this.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.467
We're gonna make it
through this day,

08:30.469 --> 08:32.135
we're gonna do it together,

08:32.138 --> 08:33.437
'cause you are
everything I need.

08:33.438 --> 08:35.038
You are my love.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.740
You are going to pour
out your love to me

08:36.741 --> 08:39.342
in a perfect balance of
sugar and carbonation.

08:39.345 --> 08:40.878
You got it?

08:40.880 --> 08:43.048
And this is
Schopenhauer and Wendy.

08:44.183 --> 08:45.249
Hi.

08:45.251 --> 08:46.884
'Sup guys?

08:46.886 --> 08:48.085
We're actually women.

08:48.087 --> 08:49.219
You'll get used to that.

08:49.221 --> 08:50.723
Do I know you?

08:51.891 --> 08:52.424
Familiar face.

08:53.759 --> 08:55.127
Gotta keep goin' on the tour.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.230
I feel like I know him.

09:00.232 --> 09:01.066
Yeah?

09:03.068 --> 09:05.135
This is Ann, she's
actually a writer.

09:05.137 --> 09:06.837
And this is our cook.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.805
- Hey, what's up man?
- He doesn't speak.

09:08.807 --> 09:10.807
And that is G.

09:10.809 --> 09:12.176
Okay.

09:12.178 --> 09:13.010
Oh, let me take you
back here on the...

09:13.012 --> 09:13.846
What?

09:38.337 --> 09:40.771
What makes the perfect pizza?

09:40.773 --> 09:43.273
Hey, I'm supposed
to shadow you?

09:43.275 --> 09:44.376
First stop, best stop.

09:45.911 --> 09:47.444
You ever work in the
service industry before?

09:47.446 --> 09:48.478
Uh no.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.180
Get ready for the big leagues.

09:50.182 --> 09:51.381
Welcome to Patronies where
pizza is our philosophy

09:51.383 --> 09:52.816
and our philosophy is pizza.

09:52.818 --> 09:54.151
What's that, the
specials you asked for?

09:54.153 --> 09:55.986
I'm so glad you did
because today's special's

09:55.988 --> 09:57.988
the sausage and pepperoni
pie with gluten on the side.

09:59.358 --> 10:01.358
And if you're interested,
which I know you are,

10:01.360 --> 10:06.096
we have a very special genetically
modified option as well.

10:06.098 --> 10:09.066
So what can I get you fellas
started off to drink today?

10:09.068 --> 10:10.100
I'll do a water.

10:10.102 --> 10:11.802
- All right.
- Same.

10:11.804 --> 10:12.803
Got it.

10:12.805 --> 10:14.306
Boring, let me guess, water?

10:17.176 --> 10:19.745
We'll be right back
with the H20s, okay?

10:21.547 --> 10:23.280
Be careful with
your comedy choices.

10:23.282 --> 10:25.015
Around here, customer is king.

10:25.017 --> 10:26.485
We serve them, okay?

10:29.288 --> 10:30.354
Hey, Schop, what can I get ya?

10:30.356 --> 10:32.589
- Two lagers.
- Done and done.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.291
Uh, any auditions this week?

10:34.293 --> 10:35.859
Not this week.

10:35.861 --> 10:37.828
All right, well,
every director I meet

10:37.830 --> 10:39.465
eventually asks me how comfortable
I am getting naked, so.

10:43.869 --> 10:46.136
Did that guy's name
tag say Jack Berouac?

10:46.138 --> 10:47.871
That's what they do here.

10:47.873 --> 10:50.042
All these trailer park kids
pretend to be famous writers.

10:51.343 --> 10:52.843
You see that sweet
thing right there?

10:52.845 --> 10:54.480
She cleans my beach
house in the off season.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.784
How many
copies did you sell?

11:00.019 --> 11:01.318
Sorry.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.855
I'm still struggling
with the reality of it.

11:04.256 --> 11:06.356
Well, plenty of people
try to write books but...

11:06.358 --> 11:07.357
And whenever I
think of reality,

11:07.359 --> 11:09.192
I think of reality stars,

11:09.194 --> 11:10.560
and the newly paved
route to becoming

11:10.562 --> 11:12.898
President of the United States.

11:13.866 --> 11:15.299
Well, look at this way.

11:15.301 --> 11:18.237
You've got a new market
for adult coloring books.

11:22.574 --> 11:23.507
Patronies.

11:23.509 --> 11:24.408
Uh yes, hello.

11:24.410 --> 11:26.209
How big is your 14 inch?

11:26.211 --> 11:27.277
I'm sorry?

11:27.279 --> 11:28.412
How big is your 14 inch?

11:28.414 --> 11:31.315
- How big is our 14 inch?
- Yeah.

11:31.317 --> 11:33.984
- 14 inches.
- Oh, okay.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.352
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

11:35.354 --> 11:37.389
- Okay, thank you.
- All right, bye.

11:42.629 --> 11:44.029
You don't have an address.

11:45.464 --> 11:48.834
Oh, yeah, I'm just in
between housing right now.

11:50.302 --> 11:53.503
Well, I am sure that
this is just a pit stop

11:53.505 --> 11:55.972
on the way to wherever
it is you're going.

11:55.974 --> 11:58.175
But just approach each
day, perform every task

11:58.177 --> 12:00.310
with the devotion of
building a better resume,

12:00.312 --> 12:01.646
you should be fine.

12:01.648 --> 12:03.315
I'll get a PO box next week.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.852
You uh, you need
a place to stay?

12:07.986 --> 12:09.088
Oh, no, no, I'm good.

12:10.222 --> 12:11.223
Shower's an issue?

12:12.024 --> 12:13.457
No.

12:13.459 --> 12:15.959
People like to come here
to smell garlic and sauce.

12:15.961 --> 12:16.629
I'll be showered.

12:18.263 --> 12:19.363
Well have a washing
machine and the clothes line

12:19.365 --> 12:21.198
in the back if you need.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.500
You ever, uh, you
ever been arrested?

12:23.502 --> 12:25.302
Uh no.

12:25.304 --> 12:26.905
You ever almost been arrested?

12:28.507 --> 12:30.273
You can do a background
check if you'd like.

12:30.275 --> 12:31.310
Do I need to?

12:33.312 --> 12:34.380
Aye, boss man?

12:35.381 --> 12:36.081
Joe's here.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.482
Hey, Albert, come here.

12:38.484 --> 12:41.017
You finish this up and
bring him to the pit.

12:41.019 --> 12:43.053
And get him a book
and a name tag for me.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.490
- Welcome aboard, bud.
- Thanks.

12:50.730 --> 12:52.028
Hey, I'm Albert.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.130
What's your name?

12:53.132 --> 12:54.231
My name's John.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.232
Well that's not gonna matter,

12:55.234 --> 12:56.333
we're gonna change it anyway.

12:56.335 --> 12:57.601
Oh.

12:57.603 --> 12:59.136
Yeah, so, make
sure you fill out

12:59.138 --> 13:01.338
all that paperwork and
try to get it back to me

13:01.340 --> 13:03.340
- no later than tomorrow.
- Okay.

13:03.342 --> 13:05.041
So we can get it on
file and stuff like that.

13:05.043 --> 13:06.410
I'm sorry, I gotta ask.

13:06.412 --> 13:08.979
What's up with the
stone aged typewriter?

13:08.981 --> 13:11.047
He's very nostalgic like that.

13:11.049 --> 13:13.651
We just recently got him
a flip phone, too, so.

13:13.653 --> 13:14.584
A flip phone?

13:14.586 --> 13:17.254
Yeah, like the StarTAC.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.122
Yeah, the girls are
kind of working on him.

13:19.124 --> 13:21.057
- Wow, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:21.059 --> 13:24.361
Well the good thing about
it, all his checks cash, so.

13:24.363 --> 13:26.062
- Good, good.
- He can have three

13:26.064 --> 13:27.364
of these as far
as I'm concerned.

13:27.366 --> 13:29.501
All right, come on,
let's go meet Knee Cha.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.169
Are you gonna make my pizza?

13:32.171 --> 13:33.603
Joe, we have been
through this, okay?

13:33.605 --> 13:35.605
You're the only one who
knows how to do it right.

13:35.607 --> 13:39.009
Crispy, not a lot of cheese.

13:39.011 --> 13:40.010
Everybody makes the
pizza the exact same...

13:40.012 --> 13:41.545
Bull crap!

13:41.547 --> 13:44.016
These rednecks don't
know how to do it right.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.651
Okay.

13:46.653 --> 13:49.586
I don't know why it's
such a big deal every time.

13:49.588 --> 13:51.221
I'll make his pizza.

13:51.223 --> 13:53.158
All I want
is the crispy pizza.

13:55.695 --> 13:57.260
Hey, what's boss man's name?

13:57.262 --> 13:58.361
It's Oscar Smith.

13:58.363 --> 14:00.063
He makes us wear
these name tags,

14:00.065 --> 14:01.431
and don't wear one himself.

14:01.433 --> 14:04.100
- Awesome.
- So, you get 10 cent a month

14:04.102 --> 14:06.470
every time that you're on time,

14:06.472 --> 14:08.639
and you get a dollar
raise for every one

14:08.641 --> 14:11.208
of these that you finish.

14:11.210 --> 14:12.643
A dollar for reading a book?

14:12.645 --> 14:15.078
Yeah, which is probably
one of the reasons

14:15.080 --> 14:16.381
why we're going under, but...

14:17.717 --> 14:19.717
Oh yeah, speaking of that.

14:19.719 --> 14:21.620
We have a no phone policy.

14:23.188 --> 14:25.455
- Right, no phone.
- Yeah.

14:25.457 --> 14:26.624
Make sure you
choose one of these

14:26.626 --> 14:28.258
by the end of the day.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.526
Does it have to
be one of these?

14:29.528 --> 14:30.529
Yep.

14:37.169 --> 14:40.470
Right's for soaking,
center's for scrubbing,

14:40.472 --> 14:42.506
left is for sanitizing.

14:42.508 --> 14:43.540
Don't mix 'em up.

14:43.542 --> 14:44.576
Good luck.

14:51.583 --> 14:53.216
And 20% off after that.

14:53.218 --> 14:54.551
I like pepperoni.

14:54.553 --> 14:57.420
And thank you for
becoming a member.

14:57.422 --> 14:59.155
So you get the free
soda and the water

14:59.157 --> 15:00.156
every single time you come in.

15:00.158 --> 15:02.160
You can't beat it, am I right?

15:11.303 --> 15:13.436
If you think about
the dishes as a holon,

15:13.438 --> 15:15.607
they become just as
important as the sauce.

15:18.243 --> 15:19.509
If all the dishes were dirty,

15:19.511 --> 15:21.213
then the pizzas
would be affected.

15:22.614 --> 15:25.148
What did you do to
get stuck back here?

15:25.150 --> 15:26.653
- Why am I in the pit?
- Yeah.

15:28.453 --> 15:32.224
Some days I volunteer,
to stay away from the bar.

15:33.893 --> 15:35.360
You're in the program?

15:36.261 --> 15:37.529
Anonymity, man.

15:39.464 --> 15:40.633
I was in it, too.

15:43.636 --> 15:44.802
Off the counter boys.

15:48.641 --> 15:49.842
John, come with me.

15:52.845 --> 15:54.578
It's very easy.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.449
Right is for soaking,
left is for sanitizing.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.185
All right, move it Gandhi.

16:03.455 --> 16:05.155
So, first slice down.

16:05.157 --> 16:06.291
What'd you think?

16:07.794 --> 16:09.426
It's a job.

16:09.428 --> 16:10.560
Ah, you picked the
controversial one.

16:10.562 --> 16:12.164
Got a perfect name tag for that.

16:13.666 --> 16:17.167
So I get a dollar raise
just for reading this book?

16:17.169 --> 16:18.468
Yep.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.469
Yep, you just tell
me what you think

16:19.471 --> 16:20.437
about it afterwards.

16:20.439 --> 16:21.304
Kind of the reason I do it.

16:21.306 --> 16:21.939
You got a pen?

16:21.941 --> 16:22.709
Uh yeah.

16:24.409 --> 16:25.542
You know, I always wanted
to be a college professor.

16:25.544 --> 16:27.210
Culinary arts.

16:27.212 --> 16:28.646
And uh, this is the
closest thing I have

16:28.648 --> 16:29.716
to a survey course.

16:30.950 --> 16:31.784
You read much?

16:32.819 --> 16:34.551
Not really.

16:34.553 --> 16:37.356
Well, Knee Cha will make
you one of these tomorrow.

16:38.825 --> 16:41.826
I tell ya man, humanity is
in need of a major change.

16:41.828 --> 16:44.662
A good book is the best
way to view the world

16:44.664 --> 16:45.732
through a different lens.

16:48.701 --> 16:50.567
All right, circle up,
circle up, circle up.

16:50.569 --> 16:52.237
Wendy, you did it!

16:53.673 --> 16:56.774
You completed the required
voluntary reading list.

16:58.243 --> 17:00.343
One full year at Patronies!

17:00.345 --> 17:02.379
- Yes!
- What did you learn?

17:02.381 --> 17:03.748
All these writers are great

17:03.750 --> 17:06.751
because of what they
created, not who they were.

17:06.752 --> 17:09.753
Most of them were actually
pretty disturbed people.

17:09.756 --> 17:13.991
Hypochondriacs, self
absorbed, alcoholics.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.160
Some even suicidal.

17:16.494 --> 17:17.862
I gave Wendy a
challenge this month.

17:17.864 --> 17:20.463
Oh yes,
what's the challenge?

17:20.464 --> 17:22.432
To get the heck out of here.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.935
This kid has never been
outside of North Carolina.

17:24.936 --> 17:27.404
- No way.
- Challenge accepted.

17:28.573 --> 17:29.707
Time frame?

17:29.709 --> 17:30.641
Four weeks.

17:30.643 --> 17:32.242
No, bull.

17:32.244 --> 17:33.711
She can go to South
Carolina in like 30 minutes.

17:33.713 --> 17:35.612
Nah, she's right, South
Carolina's too close.

17:35.614 --> 17:36.513
Okay, okay.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.481
Fine, I'll do it.

17:39.384 --> 17:40.383
- Yes.
- Yes.

17:40.385 --> 17:41.418
No, you are not done yet.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.318
What are you reading next?

17:42.320 --> 17:43.286
Viktor E. Frankl.

17:43.288 --> 17:44.354
Oh, I've already read him.

17:44.356 --> 17:45.255
- You know that.
- That's enough.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.657
Okay, okay, okay.

17:46.659 --> 17:47.825
Will you ready anybody
off the board again?

17:47.827 --> 17:49.727
- Nope.
- Oh, then what philosopher?

17:49.729 --> 17:52.462
Well I guess it'll probably
have to be Nicolas Sparks.

17:53.766 --> 17:54.699
Okay, okay, who
was your favorite?

17:54.701 --> 17:55.833
Who was your favorite?

17:55.835 --> 17:56.669
Albert Camus.

17:57.704 --> 17:59.670
Because he was a good guy.

17:59.672 --> 18:02.272
I like reading philosophy
that was written by someone

18:02.274 --> 18:04.742
who was an actually
happy person.

18:04.744 --> 18:06.276
That's sweet.

18:06.278 --> 18:08.580
All right, the
results are in, folks.

18:12.652 --> 18:15.686
We sold 43 brand new
pizza memberships!

18:19.558 --> 18:21.859
Only 207 more to go.

18:21.861 --> 18:23.493
Oh.

18:23.495 --> 18:25.361
Challenge accepted.

18:27.066 --> 18:29.900
And just like the pizza dough

18:29.902 --> 18:32.535
that G made yesterday
morning, bruh!

18:32.537 --> 18:35.840
Let's eat this, come on!

18:35.842 --> 18:37.440
Come on G.

19:03.002 --> 19:04.369
Who are you?

19:06.438 --> 19:07.272
What?

19:14.847 --> 19:16.847
What's up ladies and germs?

19:16.849 --> 19:18.649
I hope you're holding
onto your butts,

19:18.651 --> 19:20.450
'cause it's day
two of John Galt.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.052
Guess what I'm doing?

19:22.054 --> 19:23.888
Just laundry on a clothesline.

19:23.890 --> 19:26.657
Just, you know, normal
laundry day.

19:26.659 --> 19:27.758
This is nuts.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.694
'Sup John?

19:29.829 --> 19:30.830
Hey.

19:31.631 --> 19:33.764
You need
an extra work shirt?

19:33.766 --> 19:34.667
I don't wear mine.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.434
No, I'm good.

19:39.739 --> 19:40.807
Are you filming me?

19:41.874 --> 19:43.874
No.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.719
Make the name
tags in the back.

19:54.553 --> 19:55.886
What'd you get?

19:55.888 --> 19:59.556
Uh, John Galt, but you
can just call me John.

19:59.558 --> 20:00.825
I like my real name.

20:00.827 --> 20:01.661
Yeah?

20:03.428 --> 20:04.795
Holden all the way.

20:04.797 --> 20:06.797
Who's Holden Caulfield?

20:06.799 --> 20:08.766
Are you serious?

20:08.768 --> 20:09.900
That's it.

20:09.902 --> 20:11.003
You get John Galt now.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.737
Catcher in the Rye?

20:13.739 --> 20:15.471
Never read it.

20:15.473 --> 20:16.843
Don't tell anybody else that.

20:22.581 --> 20:23.747
Schopenhauer.

20:23.749 --> 20:24.750
Dishes.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.922
I swear I've seen him before.

20:31.924 --> 20:33.891
Hm, weird dude.

20:33.893 --> 20:35.626
What is he even doing?

20:35.628 --> 20:37.695
What is up my
search and destroyers?

20:37.697 --> 20:39.129
Welcome to where
dreams go to die.

20:39.131 --> 20:40.530
That's where they go.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.767
I want you to stay tuned.

20:43.069 --> 20:44.668
I think she just
saw me.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.003
Let me tell you.

20:46.005 --> 20:47.570
You know, I know you
kids are young out there,

20:47.572 --> 20:48.973
so I'm gonna try to
behave myself today.

20:48.975 --> 20:50.875
Anyway, I can't say too
much now, but stay posted.

20:50.877 --> 20:52.778
Peace up, bash down.

20:53.913 --> 20:54.814
Cool selfie, bro.

20:59.952 --> 21:00.784
Why do you do that?

21:00.786 --> 21:01.819
I'm right here.

21:03.155 --> 21:04.520
I like you man, you know that?

21:04.522 --> 21:06.025
Yeah, yeah.

21:15.768 --> 21:17.500
You guys got two ply
in your bathroom?

21:17.502 --> 21:18.836
What?

21:18.838 --> 21:20.738
Is the toilet paper
gettin' thinner?

21:20.740 --> 21:21.705
Don't you think
North Carolina's

21:21.707 --> 21:22.909
had enough bathroom trouble?

21:24.844 --> 21:27.244
I need a nap now
more than ever.

21:27.246 --> 21:28.047
Tired?

21:28.948 --> 21:30.714
Well yeah.

21:30.716 --> 21:32.883
Someone kept interfering with
my Hebrew studies last night.

21:32.885 --> 21:34.952
And who would do
such a horrible thing?

21:34.954 --> 21:36.720
Aren't you supposed
to be washin' dishes?

21:36.722 --> 21:38.055
Nah, Knee Cha took ever.

21:38.057 --> 21:40.492
And Bat Mitzvahs are
for 13 year olds.

21:41.961 --> 21:43.127
I love you.

21:43.129 --> 21:44.128
Fine.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.665
Fine, I will send it tomorrow.

21:53.873 --> 21:54.674
There you go.

21:58.945 --> 22:00.012
Put your finger
here, and squeeze.

22:01.747 --> 22:02.181
Thank you.

22:03.716 --> 22:05.082
Guess we should
have seen it coming.

22:05.084 --> 22:06.616
Seen what coming?

22:06.618 --> 22:08.018
Jack told me about
the toilet paper.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.120
What does that have
to do with anything?

22:10.122 --> 22:11.689
Where's the bottle opener?

22:11.691 --> 22:13.523
- Behind the moose head.
- Behind the moose head.

22:13.525 --> 22:15.159
You updated your resume yet?

22:15.161 --> 22:15.993
I never had one.

22:15.995 --> 22:17.728
You?

22:17.730 --> 22:19.129
Hey John, that's it,
we're closed, man.

22:19.131 --> 22:20.965
Yes, sir.

22:20.967 --> 22:23.067
I got a job lined up
cleaning houses again.

22:23.069 --> 22:24.768
What about your writing?

22:24.770 --> 22:27.603
All my passions projects
are gonna make me broke.

22:27.605 --> 22:30.040
What do you think the
human life's worth?

22:30.042 --> 22:31.976
Aint it the
worth of something,

22:31.978 --> 22:34.044
whatever someone else is
willing to pay for it?

22:34.046 --> 22:35.646
So we're all just
slaves for the people

22:35.648 --> 22:36.914
with time and money?

22:36.916 --> 22:40.985
Well, tonight,
you are worth 125.

22:40.987 --> 22:41.952
Uh, got these too.

22:41.954 --> 22:44.154
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.856
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:45.858 --> 22:47.257
My turn!

22:47.259 --> 22:49.293
Hello, ladies and
gentlemen and welcome

22:49.295 --> 22:53.897
to my new character
study, John Galt.

22:53.899 --> 22:55.933
Since attaining
900,000 followers,

22:55.935 --> 22:59.336
and almost 300 million
total views on my channel,

22:59.338 --> 23:03.674
I thought it was imperative
that I go undercover.

23:03.676 --> 23:04.276
Check it out.

23:05.678 --> 23:07.144
I'm even sleepin' in my car.

23:07.146 --> 23:08.645
Method actor, sort of.

23:08.647 --> 23:09.947
Okay, okay.

23:09.949 --> 23:11.581
I gotta get started
and tell you guys about

23:11.583 --> 23:15.019
this place, little restaurant,
that somehow, somehow,

23:15.021 --> 23:19.058
made it on Reddit's top
10 best places to work.

23:21.694 --> 23:24.061
Okay, so, I've been doing a
little research on this boss

23:24.063 --> 23:26.663
who's basically failed at
everything he's tried to do.

23:26.665 --> 23:30.600
He flunked out of a bachelor's
degree in culinary arts.

23:30.602 --> 23:31.735
Culinary arts.

23:31.737 --> 23:33.003
How do you even do that?

23:33.005 --> 23:34.604
Oh my, you know
what I always say:

23:34.606 --> 23:36.974
Those who can, do.

23:36.976 --> 23:39.109
Those who can't, teach.

23:39.111 --> 23:41.945
And bro, boss man
can't even do that.

23:41.947 --> 23:43.814
Come on, man, I
gotta give it to him.

23:43.816 --> 23:45.983
He's had this
restaurant for 18 years,

23:45.985 --> 23:49.386
and here's the sad part, this
is his fourth failed business.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.923
That's right, folks, the
place is going under.

23:52.925 --> 23:55.127
What kind of top
10 place is that?

23:56.262 --> 23:57.961
Go talk to daddy,

23:57.963 --> 23:59.730
hey daddy, can I get some more
money to open another one?

23:59.732 --> 24:01.732
Baby boomers, ugh.

24:01.734 --> 24:05.736
And it's not just the restaurant,
it's like this whole town

24:05.738 --> 24:07.104
has a disease.

24:07.106 --> 24:11.041
Everybody here is just a
redneck, pathetic loser,

24:11.043 --> 24:13.777
and that is the
capital T, truth folks.

24:13.779 --> 24:15.813
What, are people gonna get mad
at me for class shamin' now?

24:15.815 --> 24:17.414
Guess what, let me put
it to you like this:

24:17.416 --> 24:19.750
it doesn't matter how
many books you read,

24:19.752 --> 24:20.984
you're still gonna be
poor, and you're still

24:20.986 --> 24:23.053
gonna have that terrible accent.

24:23.055 --> 24:27.324
And you'll never, ever,
leave this dump of a place.

24:27.326 --> 24:31.895
Oh, oh, oh, and there's even
a feminist who works there.

24:31.897 --> 24:34.731
A feminist.

24:34.733 --> 24:36.233
Let me mansplain something
to you real quick.

24:36.235 --> 24:37.701
The word feminism?

24:37.703 --> 24:39.203
It came from a man!

24:39.205 --> 24:42.739
Charles Fourier, he was
a Utopian Socialist.

24:42.741 --> 24:44.643
Oh, and we all know
how utopias end.

24:46.078 --> 24:49.179
For all you peeps who
responded to my last video,

24:49.181 --> 24:51.048
the excuses that
fat people make,

24:51.050 --> 24:53.917
I wanted to thank you for
your encouraging comments

24:53.919 --> 24:55.185
and your death threats,

24:55.187 --> 24:57.321
all of which allow
me the platform

24:57.323 --> 24:59.289
you get to see me on here today.

24:59.291 --> 25:02.027
You know, what I think
that some of you don't get

25:03.062 --> 25:04.995
is that I offer you a service.

25:04.997 --> 25:07.197
I think I deserve a
little bit of recognition.

25:07.199 --> 25:09.133
I'm not being mean.

25:09.135 --> 25:12.069
I'm just a journalist
who happens to be funny.

25:12.071 --> 25:16.740
I'm a truth teller and I'm
doing it for you guys, for you.

25:16.742 --> 25:21.011
This is my first subject in
my debunking top 10 series.

25:21.013 --> 25:24.414
If you like this video,
please go like and subscribe.

25:24.416 --> 25:28.218
Also, for my die hard search
and destroyer fans out there,

25:28.220 --> 25:30.854
if you find me, I will
feature you in my video.

25:30.856 --> 25:34.191
Give you a little taste of
what it's like to be me.

25:34.193 --> 25:35.759
Am I bragging?

25:35.761 --> 25:37.060
Eh.

25:37.062 --> 25:40.764
I also left a little
clue in the comment box

25:40.766 --> 25:42.132
where you can come
find the bridge

25:42.134 --> 25:43.433
and find where I'm at.

25:43.435 --> 25:45.736
Trust me, there's
nothing else here.

25:45.738 --> 25:48.338
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go attend some

25:48.340 --> 25:51.074
really cool redneck bonfire.

25:51.076 --> 25:53.010
All right kids, until next time.

25:53.012 --> 25:54.380
Peace up, bash down.

25:58.918 --> 26:00.217
All right, all right, good.

26:00.219 --> 26:01.518
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.253
That was good, that was
good, that was good.

26:03.255 --> 26:08.192
Yeah, just uh, I'll
just edit that tomorrow.

26:08.194 --> 26:10.294
No, pizza was
invented in Brooklyn.

26:10.296 --> 26:12.196
I know that for a fact.

26:12.198 --> 26:14.498
Pizza was invented in Naples,

26:14.500 --> 26:17.134
for King Umberto and
Queen Margherita.

26:17.136 --> 26:18.969
Bunny, bunny.

26:18.971 --> 26:20.070
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

26:20.072 --> 26:22.139
Hey, what's goin' on?

26:22.141 --> 26:23.473
Mazel tov.

26:27.146 --> 26:29.947
So, somebody comes in the
restaurant the other day

26:29.949 --> 26:34.486
and they want me to cut
a pie in odd numbers.

26:35.321 --> 26:36.887
- What?
- Yeah.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.057
They wanted it in seven
slices instead of eight.

26:39.124 --> 26:40.824
Has anybody had that happen yet?

26:40.826 --> 26:42.326
No, but someone
asked me if I had

26:42.328 --> 26:44.361
diet water the other day.

26:44.363 --> 26:45.963
- Oh my god.
- Yeah.

26:48.234 --> 26:52.202
Everybody here is
just a redneck, pathetic loser,

26:52.204 --> 26:54.004
and that is a capital T, truth.

26:54.006 --> 26:56.540
What are people gonna get mad
at me for class shamin' now?

26:56.542 --> 27:00.310
You're still gonna be poor,
and you'll never, ever leave.

27:00.312 --> 27:02.012
A feminist!

27:02.014 --> 27:04.448
Let me mansplain
something to you real...

27:04.450 --> 27:05.251
Hey!

27:07.920 --> 27:08.754
Hey.

27:10.256 --> 27:11.888
You look nice.

27:11.890 --> 27:13.959
You saw me like an hour ago.

27:14.994 --> 27:16.293
Thank you.

27:16.295 --> 27:17.561
- Bonfire.
- Yes.

27:17.563 --> 27:19.231
- On the beach.
- Yes.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.834
I think I'm gonna finish
that bartending course,

27:23.836 --> 27:24.901
you know, for real this time?

27:24.903 --> 27:26.336
Mhm.

27:26.338 --> 27:28.005
I'll probably go back to
the cruise ship, you know?

27:28.007 --> 27:31.108
Micromanaging rich people's
happiness and what not.

27:31.110 --> 27:34.211
Sometimes I think, when
I'm looking down my driveway,

27:34.213 --> 27:36.079
about what it would
actually be like

27:36.081 --> 27:37.414
to leave for the last time,

27:37.416 --> 27:39.516
but it's always the same
thing holding me back.

27:39.518 --> 27:41.954
Like who would
take care of mama?

27:43.088 --> 27:43.922
Or Knee Cha?

27:45.424 --> 27:47.958
- Hey.
- What's up guys?

27:47.960 --> 27:49.526
Where y'all been at?

27:49.528 --> 27:50.360
Ooh.

27:50.362 --> 27:51.528
It's so warm.

27:53.165 --> 27:54.197
So what do you think
about it so far, John?

27:54.199 --> 27:55.999
- Patronies?
- Yeah.

27:56.001 --> 27:56.502
It's cool.

27:58.270 --> 28:01.271
It's uh, it's exactly like Ann
wrote about in the article.

28:01.273 --> 28:02.372
- Wait, wait...
- What?

28:02.374 --> 28:03.340
What article?

28:03.342 --> 28:04.374
What are you talking about?

28:04.376 --> 28:06.109
Well it took me a minute, but,

28:06.111 --> 28:07.244
when I realized
she was a writer,

28:07.246 --> 28:08.646
I put two and two together.

28:08.648 --> 28:10.213
Wait, our Ann?

28:10.215 --> 28:11.248
I wrote a small
article on Patronies

28:11.250 --> 28:13.383
and it got passed around.

28:13.385 --> 28:15.218
I wrote it under that pseudonym.

28:15.220 --> 28:16.586
We all have our pseudonyms.

28:16.588 --> 28:19.289
- Ann, that's amazing.
- It was a small article.

28:19.291 --> 28:20.924
- Still.
- Where'd you read it?

28:20.926 --> 28:23.060
Reddit's Top 10 Most
Unique Places to Work

28:23.062 --> 28:24.294
in the Service Industry.

28:24.296 --> 28:27.130
- Wait, what number are we?
- Eight.

28:27.132 --> 28:28.365
- Oh.
- Wow.

28:28.367 --> 28:29.433
- That's good.
- That is amazing.

28:29.435 --> 28:31.335
You're a published writer.

28:31.337 --> 28:33.370
I don't think Reddit counts.

28:33.372 --> 28:35.005
Hey Ann, why didn't you
tell us about the article?

28:35.007 --> 28:36.006
I guess I also
forgot to tell you

28:36.008 --> 28:37.474
I had a grilled cheese today,

28:37.476 --> 28:39.409
I'm allergic to strawberries,
and sometimes I wake up

28:39.411 --> 28:41.178
with a small neck
pain on the left side.

28:41.180 --> 28:43.313
No, but you told everyone
about the book tour.

28:43.315 --> 28:45.349
Now why wouldn't you tell
us about the article?

28:45.351 --> 28:46.616
Ann, I thought we were friends.

28:46.618 --> 28:48.018
How could we
still be going under

28:48.020 --> 28:49.286
if we're so popular?

28:49.288 --> 28:51.421
Top 10 places
to work, not eat.

28:51.423 --> 28:52.522
I know how.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.024
- Don't.
- Are you...

28:54.026 --> 28:54.958
- Don't do it.
- I know, because our

28:54.960 --> 28:57.160
toilet paper's single ply!

28:57.162 --> 28:59.529
- No.
- Jack, sit your behind down.

28:59.531 --> 29:02.432
All right, all right,
all right, ya pain bodies.

29:02.434 --> 29:04.334
If we can't save
the restaurant,

29:04.336 --> 29:07.337
then I don't know, can we
do something for Oscar?

29:07.339 --> 29:09.506
He's done so much for all of us.

29:09.508 --> 29:13.076
Patronies is a reflection
of our own mortality, kid.

29:13.078 --> 29:13.912
It's over.

29:15.447 --> 29:16.580
They know.

29:16.582 --> 29:18.181
Who's he talking to?

29:18.183 --> 29:19.182
Oh don't worry, baby.

29:19.184 --> 29:20.450
He's just a little different.

29:20.452 --> 29:22.386
Wait,
what are you doin'?

29:22.388 --> 29:24.087
I am looking for the optimist

29:24.089 --> 29:25.055
that I normally go to bed with.

29:25.057 --> 29:26.556
Oh, yeah.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.024
I just, I wanna do more than

29:28.026 --> 29:30.262
sell pizza
memberships, you know?

29:31.698 --> 29:33.666
Yeah, I don't know,
I just don't get it.

29:35.167 --> 29:36.734
You guys wanna
spend your free time

29:36.736 --> 29:38.971
trying to save someone
else's restaurant?

29:40.139 --> 29:41.739
It's all of ours.

29:41.741 --> 29:45.344
Yeah, but, you work
for him, all of you.

29:47.479 --> 29:48.480
Hey John?

29:49.314 --> 29:52.048
What do you do with all those
photos you've been taking?

29:52.050 --> 29:53.051
Publish the truth.

29:55.053 --> 29:57.421
People have this idea.

29:57.423 --> 29:59.222
They think they know what
life is really like, but,

29:59.224 --> 30:00.492
it's usually quite different.

30:02.027 --> 30:02.594
So I show 'em the truth.

30:04.096 --> 30:05.462
I've wanted to be
a journalist since

30:05.464 --> 30:07.063
I was like 10 years old
and nobody ever hired me

30:07.065 --> 30:08.633
so I just kind of do
what I can on my own.

30:08.635 --> 30:09.767
- Yeah.
- That's pretty cool, John.

30:09.769 --> 30:11.501
- Yeah, it is.
- Thanks.

30:11.503 --> 30:15.238
So you're gonna be writing
about us, and the restaurant?

30:15.240 --> 30:16.375
Yeah, maybe.

30:16.643 --> 30:18.175
Maybe you and
Ann could team up

30:18.177 --> 30:19.476
- and write something...
- I write alone.

30:19.478 --> 30:21.011
Yeah, and
I do mostly video.

30:21.013 --> 30:22.279
Wait, wait, wait,
dude, dude, dude,

30:22.281 --> 30:23.380
I'll take you to
the perfect place

30:23.382 --> 30:25.081
for some photojournalism magic.

30:25.083 --> 30:27.017
You free tomorrow before work?

30:27.019 --> 30:28.385
Yeah, yeah that'd be great.

30:28.387 --> 30:30.554
Could we see some
of your photos now?

30:30.556 --> 30:33.624
Uh, I haven't quite
got my story yet.

30:33.626 --> 30:35.292
Well I think that's cool.

30:35.294 --> 30:36.794
It'd be like an
archive of my life

30:36.796 --> 30:38.328
for the past 10 years.

30:38.330 --> 30:39.697
Hey, mine too.

30:39.699 --> 30:41.531
You've only been
here for three years.

30:41.533 --> 30:43.467
No, but still, I think
it'd be really nice

30:43.469 --> 30:45.502
to have like a little
album, you know?

30:45.504 --> 30:47.473
And you'd be
like 10 years old.

30:50.542 --> 30:52.609
- Let's go, nope, no more.
- That's it, come on.

30:52.611 --> 30:54.344
You guys leaving already?

30:54.346 --> 30:56.246
Hey, make sure
y'all put out the fire.

30:56.248 --> 30:57.748
- Woo hoo!
- Yeah!

30:57.750 --> 30:59.650
Just don't
do anything I would do.

31:01.253 --> 31:03.489
- Cimone, you comin'?
- No, you go ahead.

31:09.294 --> 31:12.395
Do you wanna go
for a walk or something?

31:12.397 --> 31:14.099
- Yeah, let's go it.
- Okay.

31:17.135 --> 31:18.468
What's up
with that rabbit?

31:18.470 --> 31:19.639
Eh, don't ask.

31:21.440 --> 31:26.178
So Oscar's all about just
be a good person, you know?

31:27.479 --> 31:29.847
Good things happen
to good people.

31:29.849 --> 31:31.784
If I'm really being
honest with myself,

31:33.151 --> 31:35.552
I want more, you know?

31:35.554 --> 31:37.189
There's all these
things I wanna do and

31:38.490 --> 31:39.857
I get a glimpse
of an opportunity

31:39.859 --> 31:41.759
and I don't even take it.

31:41.761 --> 31:45.228
The jack of all trades
and the master of none.

31:45.230 --> 31:47.732
You're too hard on yourself.

31:47.734 --> 31:48.367
You're not?

31:49.669 --> 31:51.470
No, I gave up on
myself a long time ago.

31:52.504 --> 31:53.773
Really?

31:55.607 --> 31:56.375
Exhibit A:

31:57.844 --> 32:00.577
when I rolled into this
lovely little town of yours,

32:00.579 --> 32:02.445
the only music on the radio were

32:02.447 --> 32:04.614
these country songs
with lyrics like,

32:04.616 --> 32:05.883
"Baby, since you left me,

32:05.885 --> 32:08.318
"I can't go on
living without you."

32:08.320 --> 32:10.657
- I love that song.
- Oh, it's a terrible song.

32:12.391 --> 32:13.758
And then I thought to myself,

32:13.760 --> 32:15.292
if you replace the
woman in the song

32:15.294 --> 32:16.827
that he's complaining
about with some

32:16.829 --> 32:19.766
sort of higher concept, it
gives the song a deeper meaning.

32:22.467 --> 32:25.168
You're way more trapped
in your head than I thought.

32:26.706 --> 32:28.240
No, I'm just saying.

32:29.308 --> 32:30.841
The reason the song is so crappy

32:30.843 --> 32:33.545
is because it takes
itself so seriously.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.114
If you wanna

32:37.249 --> 32:38.548
live a life with more meaning,

32:38.550 --> 32:40.550
then you have to
create something

32:40.552 --> 32:42.287
by making something
out of nothing.

32:48.628 --> 32:50.560
I like that
you're a journalist.

32:50.562 --> 32:51.561
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:51.563 --> 32:52.665
I think it's cool.

32:56.568 --> 32:58.537
You know, when I first
started at Patronies,

32:59.839 --> 33:01.340
Oscar pulled me
aside and he said,

33:02.675 --> 33:05.277
- "What are your dreams?"
- Oh god, that guy.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.683
That was the first time
anyone's ever asked me that.

33:14.687 --> 33:16.654
He views the restaurant
as a pit stop

33:16.656 --> 33:19.422
and it's become a home to me,

33:19.424 --> 33:21.628
and I know I've been
there for way too long.

33:22.629 --> 33:23.796
But he's done a lot for us.

33:26.431 --> 33:27.597
And it'd be cool if
you could capture that

33:27.599 --> 33:29.501
in your video essay or whatever.

33:33.605 --> 33:34.539
Why are you here?

33:35.742 --> 33:37.273
I don't know.

33:37.275 --> 33:38.575
If I could go back
and tell my parents

33:38.577 --> 33:40.212
to use protection,
I probably would.

33:41.814 --> 33:44.717
I mean, why are you here in
Holden Beach, North Carolina?

33:48.520 --> 33:49.619
Why are you laying on the hood

33:49.621 --> 33:51.490
of a guy's car you barely know?

33:55.594 --> 33:56.663
You're right.

33:58.665 --> 33:59.699
I don't know you.

34:02.567 --> 34:04.569
So who are you, John Galt?

34:06.571 --> 34:08.172
Who is John Galt?

34:19.518 --> 34:21.752
Where I come from, we
call that being a tease.

34:24.489 --> 34:25.757
See you tomorrow.

34:28.427 --> 34:31.027
Just choose
something, anything.

34:31.030 --> 34:31.864
Sorry?

34:35.768 --> 34:37.737
Good things don't
happen to good people.

34:39.271 --> 34:40.670
They happen because
someone sacrificed

34:40.672 --> 34:42.940
everything they had
to get what they want.

34:42.942 --> 34:44.376
Just choose one thing.

34:47.714 --> 34:48.648
No, thanks.

34:50.382 --> 34:51.716
There's nothing in
the world that would

34:51.717 --> 34:54.685
make me sacrifice my
relationships with people,

34:54.687 --> 34:55.688
if that's what you mean.

34:56.956 --> 34:59.056
Look, I like you, John.

34:59.058 --> 35:00.993
You came into that
restaurant confident.

35:02.695 --> 35:05.497
There's a thin line between
confidence and arrogance.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.374
I'm not arrogant.

35:22.614 --> 35:24.014
Ah, come on.

35:37.830 --> 35:39.562
Sounds like you
need a jump, huh?

35:39.564 --> 35:40.833
Yeah, I guess I do.

35:41.868 --> 35:42.702
Pop your hood.

35:43.502 --> 35:44.835
Oh.

35:44.837 --> 35:47.504
I guess if I had to
choose something,

35:47.506 --> 35:48.908
this is always an option for me.

35:54.446 --> 35:56.747
Just sittin' on the
beach here in Holden Beach.

35:56.749 --> 35:57.748
With...

35:57.750 --> 35:59.016
Cimone.

35:59.018 --> 36:01.819
You do realize we
watched the sun go down

36:01.821 --> 36:03.687
- and now it's come up?
- I do, I do.

36:03.689 --> 36:04.955
I think I'm...

36:04.957 --> 36:06.657
We have to be at
work in an hour.

36:06.659 --> 36:07.892
I mean, I don't think
I have to work today.

36:07.894 --> 36:09.693
Stop taking pictures.

36:09.695 --> 36:10.795
I probably should go to work.

36:10.797 --> 36:11.829
Let's do one more, hurry.

36:13.900 --> 36:15.833
Have you been
collecting seashells

36:15.835 --> 36:17.003
- from Holden Beach?
- Yeah.

36:23.743 --> 36:26.777
Let's go.

36:26.779 --> 36:27.814
No.

37:09.188 --> 37:10.486
What are you doing?

37:10.488 --> 37:11.689
It's for my Instagram handle.

37:11.691 --> 37:12.890
You can follow me.

37:12.892 --> 37:15.993
It's called
AnotherOneBitesTheDust.

37:15.995 --> 37:18.629
You redneck, pathetic loser.

37:18.631 --> 37:20.099
Ollie,
come on, let's go.

37:24.103 --> 37:25.403
I gotta go.

37:43.588 --> 37:45.089
This is
gonna be epic, man.

37:45.091 --> 37:46.657
- I stand right here, right?
- Yes, yes, yes, all right.

37:46.659 --> 37:47.658
And the red button
is recording, yeah?

37:47.660 --> 37:48.859
Red button, I told you.

37:48.861 --> 37:49.793
- Yeah, you're fine.
- Oh, okay.

37:49.795 --> 37:50.895
I'm ready, are you ready?

37:50.897 --> 37:51.795
- I'm ready.
- All right.

37:51.797 --> 37:53.563
And three, two, one.

37:53.565 --> 37:54.832
Take a look at this place.

37:54.834 --> 37:56.133
Have you ever seen
something that is just...

37:56.135 --> 37:57.635
- So cool.
- Jack, you gotta be

37:57.637 --> 37:59.469
- quiet while I'm filming.
- Oh, oh yeah, yeah.

37:59.471 --> 38:00.671
Sorry, sorry.

38:00.673 --> 38:01.471
- And action...
- Take a look at...

38:01.473 --> 38:02.106
Are you ready?

38:02.108 --> 38:02.875
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:04.576 --> 38:07.811
Welcome to a junk yard museum,
filled with tiny houses

38:07.813 --> 38:09.880
and a whole lotta crap.

38:09.882 --> 38:11.882
This place is like classic
southern hoarding 101.

38:11.884 --> 38:13.583
They even built a
sidewalk down the middle.

38:13.585 --> 38:15.953
I feel like Moses parting
the sea of bad habits.

38:15.955 --> 38:16.987
Jack, what are you doin'?

38:16.989 --> 38:17.821
Up.

38:17.823 --> 38:19.223
Come on.

38:19.225 --> 38:22.427
Search and destroyers,
welcome to your second clue.

38:23.763 --> 38:25.896
And cut, that was
awesome.

38:25.898 --> 38:27.631
Wasn't that sort of mean?

38:27.633 --> 38:28.899
What?

38:28.901 --> 38:30.768
I mean, Mary's
a very nice lady.

38:30.770 --> 38:31.702
Ah, I mean, but let's face it.

38:31.704 --> 38:32.970
This place is a dump.

38:32.972 --> 38:34.271
Well here's a fact.

38:34.273 --> 38:35.973
Mary's a very well known
artist in the south.

38:35.975 --> 38:39.043
People come from all over
the country to see her work.

38:39.045 --> 38:40.277
Yeah, but, look dude.

38:40.279 --> 38:41.779
My followers are more interested

38:41.781 --> 38:43.513
in the comedy and
the jokes I have.

38:43.515 --> 38:45.716
I found like a nice balance
between journalism and comedy.

38:45.718 --> 38:46.984
Look, I'll show you one day.

38:46.986 --> 38:48.551
Come on, let's go
get some B roll.

38:48.553 --> 38:49.853
Now I want everything
nice and straight.

38:49.855 --> 38:51.922
Keep it side to
side, good quality.

38:51.924 --> 38:54.091
You're doin' great man,
you're doing great.

38:54.093 --> 38:55.859
Oh, now look at this.

38:55.861 --> 38:57.129
Jack, you gotta see this.

39:01.033 --> 39:03.033
Hey, hey, what do
you think about my me roll?

39:03.035 --> 39:04.600
B, B roll.

39:04.602 --> 39:05.970
- Oh, yeah.
- It's pretty good actually.

39:05.972 --> 39:07.771
Oh, well what are
you doin' right now?

39:07.773 --> 39:08.939
I am transferring your footage

39:08.941 --> 39:10.174
over to my phone.

39:10.176 --> 39:11.709
How you know what,
maybe tomorrow

39:11.711 --> 39:13.110
I can show you how to
edit some of this stuff?

39:13.112 --> 39:15.045
Yeah, are you gonna
add the stuff about

39:15.047 --> 39:16.747
Mary being a renowned artist?

39:16.749 --> 39:17.982
Sure.

39:17.984 --> 39:19.249
You ought to
interview her sometime.

39:19.251 --> 39:20.518
She's fantastic.

39:21.954 --> 39:24.021
Hey, I was thinkin', what
if you did a commercial

39:24.023 --> 39:25.022
for Patornies, huh?

39:25.024 --> 39:26.056
Not really much of a point

39:26.058 --> 39:27.191
if it's going under, right?

39:27.193 --> 39:28.759
Right, yeah.

39:28.761 --> 39:31.161
Um, what is the, what
is, what is that?

39:31.163 --> 39:32.329
Ah, lens clip.

39:32.331 --> 39:33.897
It's kind of like my trademark.

39:33.899 --> 39:34.865
Kind of like your yarmulke.

39:34.867 --> 39:36.166
Yeah, or my fanny pack.

39:36.168 --> 39:38.004
Yeah, that fanny
pack's weird, bro.

39:39.005 --> 39:40.603
Bingo!

39:40.605 --> 39:42.639
Hey come on, we're
gonna be late!

39:42.641 --> 39:44.775
I can't believe
you walk to work.

39:44.777 --> 39:46.243
Guys, come here.

39:46.245 --> 39:48.280
Hey everybody, can you
gather 'round, please?

39:54.954 --> 39:56.022
Thanks, uh...

39:58.190 --> 40:00.558
One of the hardest things
I've ever done, but uh,

40:02.128 --> 40:06.930
after 18 years, Patronies Pizza
will be closing its doors.

40:06.932 --> 40:08.332
Everything will go
on as normal for

40:08.334 --> 40:09.935
the next week to 10 days.

40:11.103 --> 40:13.639
Get your paychecks, hours,

40:15.107 --> 40:16.940
memberships, thank you so
much for the memberships,

40:16.942 --> 40:18.942
all your hard work.

40:18.944 --> 40:22.012
Don't discount anything
that any one of you

40:22.014 --> 40:23.947
has ever done for this place.

40:23.949 --> 40:25.949
You made Patronies Pizza.

40:25.951 --> 40:27.086
Thank you for that.

40:29.121 --> 40:30.723
Man, what a run it's been.

40:32.191 --> 40:36.829
Albert, can you uh, collet
the leftover memberships?

40:39.999 --> 40:42.735
Let's have a great
last week, guys.

40:44.103 --> 40:47.339
Keep your heads up.

42:01.313 --> 42:04.116
So do you uh, got any
idea what you'll do now?

42:05.151 --> 42:06.118
Uh...

42:07.920 --> 42:08.952
I've always wanted
to be a journalist.

42:08.954 --> 42:10.220
A journalist?

42:10.222 --> 42:11.056
Yeah.

42:12.024 --> 42:12.823
John, that's great.

42:12.825 --> 42:14.358
That is terrific.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.894
I'll be right on that letter
of recommendation right away.

42:16.896 --> 42:17.861
Thanks.

42:17.863 --> 42:18.795
Yeah.

42:18.797 --> 42:20.166
In the meantime, uh...

42:23.836 --> 42:26.238
Here's a little somethin'
to get your own place.

42:32.111 --> 42:34.745
- Oscar, I can't take this...
- John.

42:34.747 --> 42:36.813
You're a good guy.

42:36.815 --> 42:39.251
I'm just sorry we didn't
have more time together.

42:40.953 --> 42:41.919
I can't accept this.

42:41.921 --> 42:42.755
No.

42:45.257 --> 42:47.693
A guy like you should be
sleeping in his own bed.

42:48.794 --> 42:49.862
Now get back to work.

42:52.531 --> 42:53.365
Yeah.

43:14.053 --> 43:15.221
What's wrong with you?

43:16.422 --> 43:18.188
Day three and I'm taking out

43:18.190 --> 43:19.923
the trash like a
regular peasant.

43:19.925 --> 43:21.391
"The meaning of life
may be all the things.

43:21.393 --> 43:23.126
"What if it's
truth that means..."

43:23.128 --> 43:24.895
Hey, Knee Cha.

43:24.897 --> 43:26.163
"What's if it's true
that the meaning..."

43:26.165 --> 43:28.065
What makes the perfect pizza?

43:28.067 --> 43:29.366
Is it the sauce?

43:29.368 --> 43:30.500
The dough?

43:30.502 --> 43:32.069
The presentation?

43:32.071 --> 43:34.972
Every ingredient is
simultaneously a whole.

43:34.974 --> 43:37.343
You're part of something great.

43:39.044 --> 43:39.878
Because...

43:42.982 --> 43:43.914
Your
happiness doesn't

43:43.916 --> 43:45.050
fix everything, Jack.

43:49.321 --> 43:50.155
How's it goin'?

43:53.592 --> 43:56.460
Not good.

43:56.462 --> 43:57.296
Not good.

44:00.899 --> 44:02.199
All right, come on, Ann.

44:02.201 --> 44:03.533
I got a lot of
paperwork, what's up?

44:03.535 --> 44:04.968
How much do we need?

44:04.970 --> 44:06.270
I don't know.

44:06.272 --> 44:07.604
Oscar doesn't talk
to me about that.

44:07.606 --> 44:09.172
So basically it's
a fundraising site

44:09.174 --> 44:10.274
and I think we can
get people to donate.

44:10.276 --> 44:11.176
Here, take a look.

44:18.250 --> 44:19.516
What, no yarmulke today?

44:19.518 --> 44:21.084
Not feeling Jewish anymore?

44:21.086 --> 44:22.252
Oh yeah, your rabbit
ate it, all right?

44:22.254 --> 44:24.089
My rabbit is more of a...

44:27.326 --> 44:28.294
She must be lonely.

44:30.329 --> 44:32.362
Schop's right, I
gotta be serious.

44:32.364 --> 44:33.899
Those six dollars are mine.

44:34.967 --> 44:36.199
Hey, wait, wait, ooh.

44:36.201 --> 44:37.936
You don't have
your pad, slugger.

44:43.042 --> 44:45.208
Mrs. Fiona Graham, I'll
have you know I plan on

44:45.210 --> 44:46.977
being ever free today and earn

44:46.979 --> 44:49.146
all six of those dollars.

44:49.148 --> 44:50.881
We'll see.

44:50.883 --> 44:53.517
I'll do the gluten
free pepperoni calzone.

44:53.519 --> 44:57.923
Uh, we only have gluten
free dough for the large pies.

44:58.957 --> 45:00.257
Fine.

45:00.259 --> 45:01.525
How is that, ah,
that's more like an error

45:01.527 --> 45:03.896
on your part, don't
you think, hm?

45:06.498 --> 45:07.531
You're right.

45:07.533 --> 45:08.633
Sorry.

45:08.635 --> 45:09.535
Customer is king.

45:10.302 --> 45:11.568
Or queen.

45:11.570 --> 45:13.437
I'll do the gluten
free pepperoni

45:13.439 --> 45:15.207
and mushroom pizza then.

45:16.342 --> 45:17.242
And a water.

45:18.510 --> 45:19.345
My pleasure.

45:22.649 --> 45:24.514
So together, we
have 3,000 friends.

45:24.516 --> 45:26.149
If 10 percent of them
donate a few bucks,

45:26.151 --> 45:27.617
or at least respond
to the message...

45:27.619 --> 45:28.985
I don't know, Ann, that
seems like a pyramid scheme.

45:28.987 --> 45:30.020
No, no, no.

45:30.022 --> 45:32.055
It's multi-level marketing.

45:32.057 --> 45:33.423
Let's just see what happens.

45:33.425 --> 45:36.560
More like some multi-level
waste of my time.

45:36.562 --> 45:38.061
You're a hater.

45:38.063 --> 45:39.563
Knee Cha's in
here breaking dishes

45:39.565 --> 45:43.066
and you talkin' about pyramids,
the Sphinx and the Nile?

45:43.068 --> 45:44.401
G, where's my order?

45:44.403 --> 45:45.670
What'd you have?

45:45.672 --> 45:46.905
Gluten free
pepperoni mushroom.

45:48.407 --> 45:50.240
Oh, I'm supposed
to tell you we're out

45:50.242 --> 45:51.608
of gluten free dough.

45:51.610 --> 45:54.980
So, we're out of
gluten free dough.

45:56.281 --> 45:57.447
- Great.
- It's not congealing.

45:57.449 --> 45:59.151
Oh, don't tell me that.

46:06.458 --> 46:08.325
Uh, Mrs. Graham, I'm
really sorry but we're

46:08.327 --> 46:10.026
out of gluten-free dough.

46:10.028 --> 46:11.528
It's not congealing, and I
brought a water here for you

46:11.530 --> 46:13.397
and to see maybe if you
wanna order something else.

46:13.399 --> 46:15.033
I'm really sorry, but...

46:16.435 --> 46:19.336
No, actually, let me
tell you something.

46:19.338 --> 46:22.072
You shouldn't say I'll do
your gluten free calzone,

46:22.074 --> 46:25.041
or I'll do a diet soda, or
I'll do your house salad.

46:25.043 --> 46:26.977
Just say you want
the house salad.

46:26.979 --> 46:30.046
Or better yet, you'll have
the house salad, please.

46:30.048 --> 46:31.682
And don't bring your cell
phone to a restaurant.

46:31.684 --> 46:34.451
You came here to
eat, and it's rude.

46:34.453 --> 46:35.320
You got that?

46:36.388 --> 46:38.121
That's a great idea.

46:38.123 --> 46:39.358
But I came here to be served.

46:43.996 --> 46:44.631
No.

46:46.265 --> 46:48.267
You come to a restaurant
to spend time with people.

46:53.505 --> 46:56.239
I'll do your IPA at
the locals discount.

46:56.241 --> 47:00.444
Okay, so that's two
lagers and one IPA.

47:00.446 --> 47:01.746
John.

47:01.748 --> 47:03.380
John!

47:03.382 --> 47:04.316
Sam Zander!

47:09.656 --> 47:10.489
Hey!

47:12.591 --> 47:14.627
Peace up, bash down.

47:16.629 --> 47:18.629
Search and destroy!

47:18.631 --> 47:21.231
- Oliver, come back!
- Sam Zander!

47:21.233 --> 47:22.733
Come back here.

47:22.735 --> 47:25.402
Come on, a bunch of redneck,
pathetic losers work here.

47:25.404 --> 47:26.403
What is wrong with you?

47:26.405 --> 47:28.607
Get off of me, now!

47:32.611 --> 47:33.577
John?

47:33.579 --> 47:35.278
Are you okay?

47:35.280 --> 47:36.480
I gotta go.

47:36.482 --> 47:38.448
What's going on?

47:38.450 --> 47:40.417
Will you please just stop?

47:40.419 --> 47:42.152
Where are you going?

47:42.154 --> 47:43.420
John.

47:43.422 --> 47:44.354
John, what happened in there?

47:44.356 --> 47:45.690
Why are you so upset?

47:45.692 --> 47:48.091
Please talk to me.

47:48.093 --> 47:49.459
Please.

47:49.461 --> 47:50.828
Why did that kid upset you?

47:50.830 --> 47:52.531
Will you please just talk to me?

47:55.133 --> 47:55.768
John.

47:57.236 --> 47:58.070
Please.

47:59.839 --> 48:01.338
What was that kid saying?

48:01.340 --> 48:03.273
I'm just building
content for my channel,

48:03.275 --> 48:04.407
you wouldn't understand.

48:04.409 --> 48:05.308
Channel?

48:05.310 --> 48:06.610
I don't understand.

48:06.612 --> 48:08.078
What does that even
mean, I don't...

48:08.080 --> 48:08.681
John?

48:10.148 --> 48:11.183
What's going on here?

48:13.820 --> 48:15.485
Sam Zander.

48:15.487 --> 48:18.088
He's the troll who fat shames
people on the internet.

48:18.090 --> 48:19.155
What?

48:19.157 --> 48:20.490
I knew it.

48:20.492 --> 48:22.425
Cimone, he's been lying
to us this whole time.

48:22.427 --> 48:23.426
All right.

48:23.428 --> 48:25.097
He's a monster in a costume.

48:27.634 --> 48:28.467
Monster?

48:30.168 --> 48:31.702
I am achieving my
dreams when all you

48:31.704 --> 48:33.503
ever do is talk about yours.

48:33.505 --> 48:34.872
You stay here
waiting for something

48:34.874 --> 48:36.809
that will never happen for you.

48:38.745 --> 48:41.746
I have a million followers,
and I earned every one of 'em.

48:41.748 --> 48:42.815
How many do you have?

48:44.516 --> 48:46.449
Oh, and if you guys
wanna stop being on

48:46.451 --> 48:48.318
the wrong end of people's jokes,

48:48.320 --> 48:50.620
then maybe stop being such
an American freakin' tragedy.

48:50.622 --> 48:52.790
Let go of me now!

48:52.792 --> 48:54.157
Get off me!

48:55.494 --> 48:57.494
You're supposed to feature
me on your channel.

48:57.496 --> 48:59.398
Peace up, bash down!

49:00.599 --> 49:01.766
Get off!

49:03.836 --> 49:04.671
Stop it!

49:06.839 --> 49:09.539
This is our renaissance.

49:09.541 --> 49:11.341
The world is changing,
and you all have

49:11.343 --> 49:13.813
front row seats to sit and
watch it happen on your screens.

49:15.447 --> 49:17.316
If you wanna make it,
you have to create.

49:18.718 --> 49:21.251
Otherwise, sit back
and enjoy the show.

49:21.253 --> 49:24.554
'Cause all you'll ever be
is someone else's audience.

49:24.556 --> 49:26.222
Very good.

49:26.224 --> 49:28.193
You're a real hero
behind the keyboard.

49:29.561 --> 49:30.195
Yeah.

49:31.631 --> 49:34.297
And you'll make a great
house wife one day, Wendy.

49:34.299 --> 49:35.133
John.

49:37.603 --> 49:38.535
Knee Cha, no.

49:38.537 --> 49:39.670
I'm gonna kill you!

49:39.672 --> 49:40.905
Knee Cha, stop!

49:40.907 --> 49:42.807
- Come on, come on, stop.
- Get off of me!

49:42.809 --> 49:43.774
Stop it,
it's not worth it.

49:43.776 --> 49:45.678
Get inside, get inside.

49:48.614 --> 49:49.448
Cimone.

49:50.415 --> 49:51.949
Cimone, sweetie.

49:51.951 --> 49:52.785
Come on.

50:22.314 --> 50:23.681
Maybe he's right.

50:23.683 --> 50:24.882
Okay, how
much have we raised

50:24.884 --> 50:26.449
on that fundraiser site?

50:26.451 --> 50:28.351
I don't know, 50 bucks?

50:28.353 --> 50:30.587
- That's good.
- It's from Albert.

50:30.589 --> 50:32.555
How is this not against the law?

50:32.557 --> 50:33.691
I don't know.

50:33.693 --> 50:35.358
There's nothing we can do.

50:35.360 --> 50:36.961
His audience is split
down the middle.

50:36.963 --> 50:39.562
There's people who love
him, people who hate him.

50:39.564 --> 50:41.566
Both sides make him
money by watching.

50:43.568 --> 50:44.369
You can't win.

50:45.738 --> 50:47.504
You gotta kill him.

50:47.506 --> 50:49.774
He's popular because
he hates everything.

50:49.776 --> 50:52.242
He doesn't even know
who Holden Caulfield is.

50:52.244 --> 50:52.845
I know!

50:54.279 --> 50:55.412
I'm like him.

50:55.414 --> 50:56.579
- No.
- No, Ann.

50:56.581 --> 50:58.415
We both wanna be our own boss.

50:58.417 --> 51:00.417
He's just found a way
to get an audience.

51:00.419 --> 51:03.656
Well, you can read the
eulogy at his funeral.

51:06.626 --> 51:08.425
Wait, Ann, what
are you thinking?

51:08.427 --> 51:09.426
Oscar tells us that we're here

51:09.428 --> 51:11.528
to build a great resume,

51:11.530 --> 51:13.666
but we're actually
building a great eulogy.

51:25.343 --> 51:26.711
Sam Zander!

51:26.713 --> 51:28.213
Search and destroy!

51:29.481 --> 51:30.848
Dude, yes!

51:30.850 --> 51:32.284
Yes, dude, yes!

51:34.854 --> 51:36.319
Man, I need to stop smokin'.

51:36.321 --> 51:38.756
Dude, why are
you walking alone?

51:38.758 --> 51:40.057
Oh dude, he's
thinking about his

51:40.059 --> 51:42.459
- next top 10 debunked videos.
- Yes, yes!

51:42.461 --> 51:43.460
Yeah.

51:43.462 --> 51:44.895
Actually, my car broke down.

51:44.897 --> 51:46.063
Oh, dude, we had to
take four hour shifts

51:46.065 --> 51:47.698
just to get here man, oh my god.

51:47.700 --> 51:49.499
Hey,
who's we white man?

51:49.501 --> 51:50.433
Dude.

51:50.435 --> 51:51.669
It doesn't work like that.

51:51.671 --> 51:52.937
Hey, do you guys
happen to have

51:52.939 --> 51:54.604
a couch I could
crash on tonight?

51:54.606 --> 51:55.706
Dude, so what
time does Patronies close?

51:55.708 --> 51:56.674
- Yes!
- We totally went by there

51:56.676 --> 51:58.776
and the lights were all off.

51:58.778 --> 51:59.744
But that's probably the reason

51:59.746 --> 52:00.811
why they're closing, right?

52:00.813 --> 52:02.345
Yeah!

52:02.347 --> 52:03.647
Oh, and there's
a bunch of cars

52:03.649 --> 52:05.015
still in the parking
lot, it's weird.

52:05.017 --> 52:06.549
So how does this work?

52:06.551 --> 52:07.818
Yeah, can you set us
up like that Asian guy?

52:07.820 --> 52:09.319
Yeah, he has his
own channel now?

52:09.321 --> 52:10.620
Dude...

52:10.622 --> 52:11.454
We could
be the two dudes!

52:11.456 --> 52:12.790
The two dudes!

52:12.792 --> 52:13.924
Dude, oh, oh, and
don't worry about

52:13.926 --> 52:15.826
the Feminist2oh25 comments.

52:15.828 --> 52:17.828
We totally handled
that keyboard warrior.

52:17.830 --> 52:19.063
Yeah, she should
do the world a favor

52:19.065 --> 52:20.396
and just kill herself.

52:20.398 --> 52:21.333
Whoa, dude.

52:22.802 --> 52:24.534
Look man, what we're
trying to say is that

52:24.536 --> 52:25.870
you're an inspiration, man.

52:25.872 --> 52:27.938
You're the only truth
teller on the internet.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.539
Only one.

52:29.541 --> 52:31.041
Thanks guys, but look,
I don't have my equipment.

52:31.043 --> 52:32.509
- So you guys have a good night.
- Oh dude, but that's okay

52:32.511 --> 52:33.510
'cause I brought mine.

52:33.512 --> 52:34.745
We could use mine.

52:34.747 --> 52:35.646
We've been recording
you since we

52:35.648 --> 52:37.081
got out of the car.

52:37.083 --> 52:39.049
You know, for people to
see how you are off camera.

52:39.051 --> 52:41.051
You know what I mean?

52:41.053 --> 52:42.686
I can't wait to see the
comments when I post this.

52:42.688 --> 52:44.655
Dude, my dad said never
to meet your heroes,

52:44.657 --> 52:46.657
but like, in person
you're totally dope.

52:46.659 --> 52:47.758
Yeah, we didn't
even know when we

52:47.760 --> 52:49.026
were gonna catch
you by yourself.

52:49.028 --> 52:50.460
I always thought
that you'd be all

52:50.462 --> 52:51.862
around all the
females, you know?

52:51.864 --> 52:54.564
But I guess you are
still undercover, so,

52:54.566 --> 52:55.666
yeah, that makes sense.

52:55.668 --> 52:56.967
So yeah man.

52:56.969 --> 53:01.371
Uh, Sammy, when my
friend, is the next party?

53:01.373 --> 53:02.807
Yeah, is there
another bonfire tonight?

53:02.809 --> 53:03.876
- Bonfire!
- Bonfire!

53:05.577 --> 53:07.845
- Tonight!
- Bonfire!

53:07.847 --> 53:08.712
Turn that off man, come on.

53:08.714 --> 53:09.847
Ah, come on man.

53:09.849 --> 53:11.048
Yeah, bonfire!

53:11.050 --> 53:12.317
Man, turn it off!

53:13.618 --> 53:14.452
What?

53:20.392 --> 53:22.793
Just met the president of
Peace Up, Bash Down channel,

53:22.795 --> 53:24.527
Mr. Sam Zander,
and you know what?

53:24.529 --> 53:25.863
He's not even as
cool as you think.

53:25.865 --> 53:28.766
He's more of a lone
soul, so needless to say,

53:28.768 --> 53:30.400
we're no longer fans.

53:30.402 --> 53:31.534
Sam Zander.

53:31.536 --> 53:32.905
More like Sam Phony.

53:34.073 --> 53:35.373
Turn it off, dude!

53:36.742 --> 53:38.610
Don't
touch his phone, bruh.

53:42.949 --> 53:44.715
You're about to become
World Star famous, bro.

53:44.717 --> 53:46.616
Yeah, dude.

53:46.618 --> 53:49.119
We got Sam Zander,
president of Peace Up,

53:49.121 --> 53:50.921
about to get bashed
down channel!

53:52.457 --> 53:53.391
- Oh!
- Yeah!

53:55.061 --> 53:57.427
World Star!

54:06.806 --> 54:10.975
Hey, you comin'?

54:10.977 --> 54:15.948
He's gotta come back
for his car sometime.

54:35.902 --> 54:37.234
Hey.

54:37.236 --> 54:39.870
You okay?

54:39.872 --> 54:41.537
Come.

54:41.539 --> 54:42.174
Come on.

55:13.940 --> 55:15.975
My life thinks you
look like Brad Pitt.

55:17.076 --> 55:17.910
Thank you.

55:19.879 --> 55:20.713
Come.

55:36.028 --> 55:36.862
Here you go.

55:48.674 --> 55:50.708
It's just a phase.

55:50.710 --> 55:51.875
When you're in it,
you think it might

55:51.877 --> 55:53.609
be that way forever.

55:53.611 --> 55:55.578
The 60s were about free love.

55:55.580 --> 55:57.247
The 70s, with the hippies.

55:57.249 --> 55:59.883
The 80s with the
cocaine and jogging.

55:59.885 --> 56:02.653
Today, the art of
listening is gone

56:02.655 --> 56:04.955
because of all
these technologies.

56:04.957 --> 56:06.659
But it's just a phase, Johnny.

56:09.028 --> 56:09.829
It's um,

56:11.163 --> 56:11.998
Sam.

56:13.165 --> 56:14.000
My name's Sam.

56:15.267 --> 56:16.834
That's a good name.

56:16.836 --> 56:17.870
My grandson's Sam.

56:21.606 --> 56:25.042
You know, sometimes when
bad things happen to me,

56:25.044 --> 56:26.611
I say to myself, "Guillermo."

56:33.919 --> 56:34.920
Thanks.

56:37.323 --> 56:38.657
It's just a phase.

56:50.602 --> 56:51.871
Got it!

56:55.307 --> 56:57.009
I believe you
owe me some money.

57:08.988 --> 57:11.891
I uh, I wrote that
for you last night.

57:12.925 --> 57:14.024
A letter of recommendation.

57:14.026 --> 57:15.027
Yeah, you can keep that.

57:16.829 --> 57:17.863
Just be a good guy.

57:18.798 --> 57:19.763
"Just be a good..."

57:19.765 --> 57:20.800
Why do people say that?

57:21.801 --> 57:23.002
This is how I make a living.

57:24.203 --> 57:26.103
You feel alive?

57:26.105 --> 57:27.204
Do I feel alive?

57:27.206 --> 57:28.906
Oh, god.

57:28.908 --> 57:31.008
Other than yesterday,
and apparently last night,

57:31.010 --> 57:32.910
have you ever once
had a conversation?

57:32.912 --> 57:35.679
Went to dinner with one
of your followers, hm?

57:35.681 --> 57:36.980
The whole internet
is my conversation

57:36.982 --> 57:38.115
and my dating life is just fine,

57:38.117 --> 57:39.051
but thanks for asking.

57:40.820 --> 57:43.122
You know, I watched the
first video you ever published.

57:44.390 --> 57:46.824
How you were
battling depression.

57:46.826 --> 57:47.891
Mad at the world
'cause you couldn't

57:47.893 --> 57:49.161
find a job as a journalist.

57:49.929 --> 57:51.228
Yeah.

57:51.230 --> 57:52.896
You know, it almost
felt like I was

57:52.898 --> 57:56.102
watching a real human
being with feelings there.

57:59.071 --> 58:01.872
I wonder how much
of that guy is left.

58:01.874 --> 58:05.142
What's left is I'm a
successful journalist now,

58:05.144 --> 58:07.144
making my own way in the world.

58:07.146 --> 58:10.182
Like you, or like you before
you put your business under.

58:12.351 --> 58:16.153
And like me, you
need an audience.

58:16.155 --> 58:18.224
You cater to them
the same way I do.

58:20.092 --> 58:22.394
Different methods shooting
for the same results.

58:23.462 --> 58:24.630
You're like me.

58:26.031 --> 58:27.898
I'm just better at it.

58:27.900 --> 58:29.900
You know, when you
get to be my age,

58:29.902 --> 58:31.768
and I do hope you get there,

58:31.770 --> 58:35.272
you'll start to realize that
everybody used to be something.

58:35.274 --> 58:37.910
You just make sure that this
is the something that you want.

58:39.211 --> 58:40.813
'Cause it'd be a
real, real tragedy

58:42.181 --> 58:44.815
if you did this because
you thought you had to

58:44.817 --> 58:46.752
in order to make
something people want.

58:50.189 --> 58:51.957
I wish you more than luck, Sam.

58:54.126 --> 58:55.726
Yeah.

58:55.728 --> 58:56.362
Luck...

58:59.031 --> 59:00.166
Is for losers.

59:07.239 --> 59:08.440
It's just a phase.

59:14.079 --> 59:18.248
Well they say giants fall
hard, but I did not expect this.

59:18.250 --> 59:22.152
Boss man gave me a
letter of recommendation.

59:22.154 --> 59:23.287
Hm.

59:23.289 --> 59:24.821
What do you guys think?

59:24.823 --> 59:27.391
Should we read this
tonight?

59:27.393 --> 59:29.361
I can't imagine what
this says, it's...

59:43.142 --> 59:43.976
Rough night?

59:46.011 --> 59:48.278
Some cars are poorly made.

59:48.280 --> 59:52.017
Leaving your lights on,
that's sort of a user error.

59:53.319 --> 59:55.552
Yeah, I'm starting
to learn that.

59:55.554 --> 59:57.223
It still runs though.

01:00:00.159 --> 01:00:01.327
Tell me, Sam.

01:00:07.032 --> 01:00:09.266
What happens when you
sacrifice everything you have

01:00:09.268 --> 01:00:10.869
for a dream that
doesn't work out?

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:12.938
What are you left with?

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.140
Well, this video's
only projected

01:00:17.142 --> 01:00:18.108
to have a couple million views

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:19.478
and the one before had nine.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.315
So it seems like my business
is in a bit of a decline.

01:00:25.884 --> 01:00:26.518
I don't know.

01:00:28.554 --> 01:00:30.923
Maybe I need to choose
some better subjects.

01:00:32.258 --> 01:00:34.260
Something a little
more interesting.

01:00:37.429 --> 01:00:38.264
Nice one.

01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:01.251
Look, ladies and
gentlemen, there she is.

01:01:01.253 --> 01:01:05.791
Cimone, Patronies own Academy
award winning actress.

01:01:07.226 --> 01:01:08.294
I could've had her.

01:01:11.196 --> 01:01:12.264
So lonely.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.141
Never find happiness.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.848
Whoa!

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:12.389
You guys wanna watch a video
of him gettin' knocked out?

01:02:12.391 --> 01:02:13.225
I do.

01:02:14.093 --> 01:02:14.927
Let's go.

01:02:19.298 --> 01:02:21.365
This is gonna be our
last Tuesday together.

01:02:21.367 --> 01:02:22.933
- Hello.
- Oh, hey.

01:02:22.935 --> 01:02:24.201
What are you doin'?

01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:25.369
Ah, I think I
wanna make movies.

01:02:25.371 --> 01:02:26.937
Really?

01:02:26.939 --> 01:02:28.405
Oh, don't worry,
you're already casted.

01:02:28.407 --> 01:02:29.674
Oh, thank you, but what
are you doing right now?

01:02:29.676 --> 01:02:31.141
Ah, it's hard to
say because it's

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:32.542
always right now, you know?

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:34.010
What are you doing
on your phone, nimrod?

01:02:34.012 --> 01:02:35.345
Scrolling through
John's videos.

01:02:35.347 --> 01:02:36.279
I've been watching
his camera angles...

01:02:36.281 --> 01:02:37.682
Come on, seriously?

01:02:37.684 --> 01:02:38.982
- Don't watch his stuff.
- Well he didn't log

01:02:38.984 --> 01:02:40.250
out of his account on my phone,

01:02:40.252 --> 01:02:41.318
so I've been
studying how and when

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.653
he releases his videos.

01:02:42.655 --> 01:02:44.254
He's got a real
strategy behind this.

01:02:44.256 --> 01:02:47.627
He just keep goin'...

01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:51.428
Hey Cimone, come here,
you've got to see this.

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:53.031
Ann, this is how we do it.

01:02:53.999 --> 01:02:55.534
Got my to go orders?

01:03:01.073 --> 01:03:01.674
Hey man.

01:03:03.643 --> 01:03:05.611
I always wondered if
you had a name tag.

01:03:12.117 --> 01:03:13.018
I don't wear it.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.321
Bureaucratic reasons.

01:03:24.363 --> 01:03:27.030
So we have full
access to John's account?

01:03:27.032 --> 01:03:27.667
Yep.

01:03:29.168 --> 01:03:31.301
I say we just delete everything.

01:03:31.303 --> 01:03:32.703
He probably has back ups.

01:03:32.705 --> 01:03:34.271
Well, whatever, it'd
take him like hours

01:03:34.273 --> 01:03:35.708
to find all of that,
so we delete it all.

01:03:37.376 --> 01:03:40.377
So his videos would
go back to zero views?

01:03:40.379 --> 01:03:41.380
Mhm.

01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:44.016
And he'd have to start over.

01:03:45.752 --> 01:03:48.585
Cimone, welcome
to the dark side.

01:03:48.587 --> 01:03:49.421
It's about time.

01:03:54.794 --> 01:03:55.628
Do it.

01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:00.363
I got accepted!

01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:02.399
- Wendy, that's awesome!
- Yeah!

01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:03.433
I'm going in the Spring.

01:04:03.435 --> 01:04:04.802
I've been doing so much research

01:04:04.804 --> 01:04:06.403
into like their culture.

01:04:06.405 --> 01:04:07.504
Oh my god, I gotta sit down.

01:04:07.506 --> 01:04:08.572
Yeah, yeah, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:08.574 --> 01:04:09.506
UNCW has a culture?

01:04:09.508 --> 01:04:10.741
No, get this, get this.

01:04:10.743 --> 01:04:13.979
I'm going to the
University of Primorska.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.314
- Primorska?
- Yeah, it's a thing.

01:04:17.316 --> 01:04:20.217
And it's got free tuition,
even for non citizens.

01:04:20.219 --> 01:04:22.118
Wait, where's Primorska at?

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.322
Slovenia.

01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:25.155
Oh.

01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.692
I know, I know.

01:04:27.694 --> 01:04:29.292
I guess I gotta get a
passport now, right?

01:04:29.294 --> 01:04:30.795
Yeah, I guess you do.

01:04:30.797 --> 01:04:32.596
So wait, wait, wait, what
are you gonna be studying?

01:04:32.598 --> 01:04:33.631
Happiness.

01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.065
No, don't play language games.

01:04:35.067 --> 01:04:36.199
- Tell me, for real.
- No, no, no.

01:04:36.201 --> 01:04:38.435
It's called positive psychology.

01:04:38.437 --> 01:04:40.203
You gettin' a
PhD in happiness?

01:04:40.205 --> 01:04:42.272
Well it's undergrad, but yeah.

01:04:42.274 --> 01:04:44.709
Oh my god, Wendy, I am
so freakin' proud of you.

01:04:44.711 --> 01:04:46.109
Thank you, thank you.

01:04:46.111 --> 01:04:49.412
I, I didn't do it for you.

01:04:49.414 --> 01:04:51.682
Oh man, I don't
care why you did it.

01:04:51.684 --> 01:04:53.316
You are going to be
gettin' out of here.

01:04:53.318 --> 01:04:55.452
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yeah.

01:04:55.454 --> 01:04:56.654
I gotta go, I gotta
go tell Knee Cha.

01:04:56.656 --> 01:04:57.822
- Yeah, yeah, tell him.
- Okay, okay.

01:04:57.824 --> 01:05:00.423
Knee Cha, come here!

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.332
Come with me.

01:05:09.334 --> 01:05:11.101
Come with me.

01:05:11.103 --> 01:05:11.736
What's wrong, Ann?

01:05:11.738 --> 01:05:12.571
What?

01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:14.538
Are you smilin'?

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.840
It's like you are smiling.

01:05:15.842 --> 01:05:16.741
What is that about?

01:05:16.743 --> 01:05:18.809
Come on.

01:05:18.811 --> 01:05:21.144
Oscar's more of a
father figure than anyone

01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:22.080
my mom brings home.

01:05:23.348 --> 01:05:24.447
I come in early
every morning just

01:05:24.449 --> 01:05:25.816
to hang out with him for a bit.

01:05:25.818 --> 01:05:28.218
- Is this for Oscar?
- It's for us.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.221
It was a good job.

01:05:30.455 --> 01:05:32.188
I don't know what else to say.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:33.791
And cut.

01:05:33.793 --> 01:05:34.794
Good work, brother.

01:05:36.595 --> 01:05:37.460
Okay, Albert, you're up.

01:05:37.462 --> 01:05:38.528
All right, cool.

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:39.864
All right, come on over here.

01:05:39.866 --> 01:05:40.898
All right, so what
we got going on?

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.365
All right, you're gonna stand,

01:05:42.367 --> 01:05:42.867
you're gonna stand
right here, right here.

01:05:42.869 --> 01:05:44.434
Okay.

01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:45.703
Right in front of that
thing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:45.705 --> 01:05:46.804
Turn around, turn around
for me, very good.

01:05:46.806 --> 01:05:47.604
You handle me too much, Jack.

01:05:47.606 --> 01:05:48.605
Okay.

01:05:48.607 --> 01:05:49.640
All right now, ready?

01:05:49.642 --> 01:05:52.409
In three, two, one.

01:05:52.411 --> 01:05:53.711
Action.

01:05:53.713 --> 01:05:56.647
I applied to work
here because I had a kid

01:05:56.649 --> 01:05:58.883
and I missed the first
two years of her life

01:05:58.885 --> 01:06:01.585
and I was determined that I
wasn't gonna miss any more.

01:06:01.587 --> 01:06:05.355
So Oscar gave me an
opportunity to do that

01:06:05.357 --> 01:06:06.924
and I'm always
gonna be grateful,

01:06:06.926 --> 01:06:09.593
even though I punched you
when you tried to hug me.

01:06:09.595 --> 01:06:12.329
And I didn't mean it,
but when a 6'8" dude

01:06:12.331 --> 01:06:16.701
comes in to hug you,
it's not gentle love.

01:06:16.703 --> 01:06:18.936
So I thank you man,
I appreciate it.

01:06:18.938 --> 01:06:19.870
Pow!

01:06:19.872 --> 01:06:20.905
Nah, I'm just playin'.

01:06:20.907 --> 01:06:22.238
And cut.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.741
- Very nice.
- That was good, right?

01:06:23.743 --> 01:06:24.541
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, all right.

01:06:24.543 --> 01:06:25.910
Not too much?

01:06:25.912 --> 01:06:27.277
I came out a little
over two years ago

01:06:27.279 --> 01:06:28.713
and the only aspect of my life

01:06:28.715 --> 01:06:31.548
that hadn't flipped upside
down was Patronies Pizza.

01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:33.617
To all the Sam Zander
fans out there,

01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:35.218

01:06:39.224 --> 01:06:41.424
- We need more people.
- You wanna get Patrone?

01:06:41.426 --> 01:06:42.361
He spoke today.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.835
The testimonials
are nice, but uh,

01:06:50.837 --> 01:06:53.303
they only fit on
the small screen.

01:06:53.305 --> 01:06:54.537
Ann?

01:06:54.539 --> 01:06:55.607
She's got a plan.

01:06:57.376 --> 01:06:59.242
Every person,
past and present.

01:06:59.244 --> 01:07:00.711
Just to be clear,
you're asking for my help?

01:07:00.713 --> 01:07:01.812
Can you do it?

01:07:01.814 --> 01:07:03.548
Pinky swear you need my help.

01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:05.883
Okay, yay.

01:07:05.885 --> 01:07:08.653
Um, I'll have Albert
draw up a list of names

01:07:08.655 --> 01:07:09.586
and then where should I start?

01:07:09.588 --> 01:07:10.587
From the beginning.

01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:11.354
Okay, I can do it.

01:07:11.356 --> 01:07:12.255
Yes, I can.

01:07:12.257 --> 01:07:13.390
I believe in myself.

01:07:13.392 --> 01:07:14.357
Guess this is what she meant

01:07:14.359 --> 01:07:15.560
by buildin' a great eulogy.

01:07:16.595 --> 01:07:17.630
Told you.

01:07:18.563 --> 01:07:19.897
Herd.

01:07:19.899 --> 01:07:21.564
What if we can't
get the people here?

01:07:21.566 --> 01:07:22.667
We're gonna get them
here, they're gonna come.

01:07:22.669 --> 01:07:23.768
Okay, right.

01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:25.268
I believe in us.

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:26.569
- We got this.
- Should we do affirmations?

01:07:26.571 --> 01:07:27.640
Teamin' on.

01:07:29.307 --> 01:07:30.573
It's too much.

01:07:30.575 --> 01:07:31.642
I know, I'm really
trying with you.

01:07:31.644 --> 01:07:32.511
- Send an email.
- Okay.

01:07:34.681 --> 01:07:35.580
She wants my help.

01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:49.359
Hey Wendy.

01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:50.195
Hey.

01:07:55.768 --> 01:07:57.034
Lettin' the rabbit
out of the cage, huh?

01:07:57.036 --> 01:07:58.301
Yeah.

01:07:58.303 --> 01:07:59.837
That's very poetic.

01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:01.739
Well I was letting
him take a crap

01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:03.542
before we get into the car.

01:08:09.481 --> 01:08:10.715
What'd you name this one?

01:08:10.717 --> 01:08:11.749
Tolstoy.

01:08:11.751 --> 01:08:14.652
Of course.

01:08:14.654 --> 01:08:15.688
Hey Wendy?

01:08:17.288 --> 01:08:21.225
We're all gonna miss
you, where you're goin'.

01:08:24.731 --> 01:08:25.997
I'm gonna miss you too.

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:31.902
Hey, don't have too
much fun in Transylvania.

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:33.770
- It's Slovenia.
- Same thing.

01:08:33.773 --> 01:08:35.675
- It's a place.
- Yeah, whatever.

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:43.916
Hey Knee Cha.

01:08:48.553 --> 01:08:49.720
I forgot to tell
you that yesterday

01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:51.523
was the last day for deliveries.

01:08:54.727 --> 01:08:56.528
How you doin', you
doin' all right?

01:08:58.363 --> 01:08:58.997
Well.

01:09:00.099 --> 01:09:01.634
I know it's about to start.

01:09:02.734 --> 01:09:03.669
Goin' back?

01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:06.569
I got to really know the guy

01:09:06.571 --> 01:09:07.939
who led the program last time.

01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:11.809
So uh, I've been
thinking about asking him

01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:13.810
if I can become his apprentice.

01:09:13.813 --> 01:09:14.846
Sounds like a plan.

01:09:15.715 --> 01:09:16.548
Yeah.

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.819
- I didn't fail.
- I know that.

01:09:22.354 --> 01:09:25.925
I'm just going
in on my own terms.

01:09:28.027 --> 01:09:29.059
I see you've
given God a break.

01:09:30.696 --> 01:09:33.733
I guess so.

01:09:36.568 --> 01:09:37.533
Hey, you're turning
in your badge?

01:09:37.536 --> 01:09:38.702
Uh uh.

01:09:38.703 --> 01:09:39.537
It's for you.

01:09:46.578 --> 01:09:47.846
"We're all in the gutter.

01:09:50.415 --> 01:09:52.718
"Some of us just choose
to look at the stars."

01:09:55.554 --> 01:09:56.923
I wanted to thank you for that.

01:09:59.792 --> 01:10:00.793
Thank you, pal.

01:10:02.094 --> 01:10:03.461
This is really cool.

01:10:04.163 --> 01:10:04.997
It's time.

01:10:07.733 --> 01:10:08.768
Time for what?

01:10:25.685 --> 01:10:27.718
- Keep 'em closed.
- Okay.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.453
We may never be famous.

01:10:30.455 --> 01:10:32.357
Hardly anyone will
remember our name.

01:10:33.659 --> 01:10:34.827
But what we do
have is each other.

01:10:36.128 --> 01:10:38.494
And today we brought
everyone here

01:10:38.496 --> 01:10:40.833
whose lives have forever
been changed by you.

01:10:41.934 --> 01:10:43.968
Okay, you can open your eyes.

01:10:46.839 --> 01:10:48.438
Man.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.874
Oh.

01:10:49.876 --> 01:10:53.443
I was 16 and I'd just be
hanging around this place.

01:10:53.445 --> 01:10:55.511
I was gettin' in to
all sorts of trouble,

01:10:55.513 --> 01:10:57.447
and you gave me a broom.

01:10:57.449 --> 01:11:00.619
You brought me in like family
and now I have one of my own.

01:11:02.188 --> 01:11:04.154
You were always more
influential than any

01:11:04.156 --> 01:11:06.957
of those books you made
us read.

01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:08.792
You know workin'
here changed me.

01:11:08.794 --> 01:11:11.461
Not just books, but
people, and then to have

01:11:11.463 --> 01:11:13.032
my daughter work
here was too cool.

01:11:16.802 --> 01:11:17.637
Hey boss.

01:11:18.838 --> 01:11:19.839
Ernie.

01:11:20.605 --> 01:11:23.175
I see my name tag
tradition held up.

01:11:24.844 --> 01:11:28.979
Well boss, we took this
and had everybody sign it

01:11:28.981 --> 01:11:31.715
from the past to the present.

01:11:31.717 --> 01:11:33.751
This is the one I used
when I dropped that pizza

01:11:33.753 --> 01:11:35.653
on the ground and
you said I couldn't

01:11:35.655 --> 01:11:37.023
apply the five second rule, so,

01:11:37.957 --> 01:11:39.156
here you go.

01:11:39.158 --> 01:11:40.824
Thank you.

01:11:40.826 --> 01:11:43.027
Everyone who has worked
for Patronies Pizza is here

01:11:43.029 --> 01:11:44.562
in one form or another.

01:11:46.832 --> 01:11:47.898
Ah.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.734
Man.

01:11:52.872 --> 01:11:56.941
You know, I always knew
when we started this project

01:11:56.943 --> 01:12:00.780
that I wanted something more
than just a pizza restaurant.

01:12:02.148 --> 01:12:03.981
It's every book
report you turned in,

01:12:03.983 --> 01:12:06.216
even though some of
you hated doing it.

01:12:06.218 --> 01:12:07.019
Schopenhauer.

01:12:08.921 --> 01:12:11.288
But they all just, they
brought me so much joy.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.191
Yeah, I think it's
because I wanted

01:12:14.193 --> 01:12:16.961
to hear about how
you viewed the world,

01:12:16.963 --> 01:12:18.764
and books meant
something to me, but,

01:12:19.899 --> 01:12:21.932
it was so much more interesting

01:12:21.934 --> 01:12:23.669
to hear what they meant to you.

01:12:26.238 --> 01:12:27.740
So thank you all for that.

01:12:31.043 --> 01:12:31.877
Wendy?

01:12:35.715 --> 01:12:39.719
You've taught me so much and
when I think about my life,

01:12:41.087 --> 01:12:43.020
I've learned that
I'll forget way more

01:12:43.022 --> 01:12:44.622
than I could ever remember.

01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:48.258
It's like trying to hold sand

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.195
with your fingers open.

01:12:50.796 --> 01:12:53.596
A lot of it falls away,
but the important stuff,

01:12:53.598 --> 01:12:54.867
it'll stick to your hand.

01:12:56.268 --> 01:12:57.103
Thank you.

01:12:59.171 --> 01:13:00.006
Ugh.

01:13:01.974 --> 01:13:06.879
I was trying to think of a
good metaphor, like Wendy.

01:13:07.579 --> 01:13:08.580
But uh...

01:13:15.755 --> 01:13:17.321
It's two ply.

01:13:17.323 --> 01:13:18.190
It's perfect.

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:19.959
Thank you.

01:13:21.994 --> 01:13:24.030
This has all been
really very touching.

01:13:25.097 --> 01:13:26.897
But how about we get some pizza?

01:13:26.899 --> 01:13:28.766
Yeah!

01:13:28.768 --> 01:13:29.668
Love it!

01:13:31.103 --> 01:13:33.837
So this guy came in and
asked for eight slices,

01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:37.341
and I was like, well, it'd be
cheaper to get the large pie.

01:13:37.343 --> 01:13:39.009
And he says to me,
"I want eight slices

01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:40.846
"broken up on
individual plates."

01:13:42.248 --> 01:13:44.048
So I come back with
the whole large pie

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:46.685
and say, "Nothing can be
broken when everything is one."

01:13:48.054 --> 01:13:50.087
Then he asks me if I'm
feeling okay and I say,

01:13:50.089 --> 01:13:52.056
"Considering humanity's
just a bunch of apes

01:13:52.058 --> 01:13:54.160
"with ego trips, I'm
doin' just fine."

01:13:55.828 --> 01:13:58.164
Then I served all eight
slices on individual plates.

01:13:59.965 --> 01:14:02.868
And he looks at me
and says, "Shalom."

01:14:04.303 --> 01:14:05.204
So then it hit me.

01:14:06.839 --> 01:14:08.774
Not only did I just
serve pizza to Incubus,

01:14:10.176 --> 01:14:12.178
but Brandon Boyd may
be a little Jewish.

01:14:13.312 --> 01:14:14.180
Maybe I am, too.

01:14:15.815 --> 01:14:18.115
The thing is, if you
wanna be religious

01:14:18.117 --> 01:14:20.951
or a rapper or a poet, go do it.

01:14:20.953 --> 01:14:22.419
Just don't be an a-hole,

01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:24.788
'cause everyone else is
trying to find their own thing

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:26.824
and way through this
contradictory, beautiful mess

01:14:26.826 --> 01:14:28.125
of a world to get
to the root of their

01:14:28.127 --> 01:14:30.062
true, authentic individuality.

01:14:32.031 --> 01:14:34.133
And if that aint true, at
least it's a pretty thought.

01:14:35.701 --> 01:14:37.167
Basically, we're all
just a small slice

01:14:37.169 --> 01:14:39.169
of a very old, extra large pie.

01:14:39.171 --> 01:14:41.038
We all come out of
the oven the same way,

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.339
spend our lives in our own ways,

01:14:42.341 --> 01:14:44.141
only to get eaten in the end.

01:14:44.143 --> 01:14:48.714
And, well, you know how the
digestive system works by now.

01:14:50.282 --> 01:14:52.816
So what makes the perfect pizza?

01:14:52.818 --> 01:14:53.853
I'll give you a hint:

01:14:54.954 --> 01:14:56.420
it's a circle.

01:14:56.422 --> 01:14:59.189
Typically it has eight slices.

01:14:59.191 --> 01:15:00.891
You could have more,
you could have less,

01:15:00.893 --> 01:15:02.025
but any amount is
better than none at all

01:15:02.027 --> 01:15:04.194
and what makes it perfect is

01:15:04.196 --> 01:15:06.196
if by the end you enjoy it,

01:15:06.198 --> 01:15:07.264
and then you keep
eatin' it and then...

01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:08.332
Jack.

01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:09.800
Come on.

01:15:09.802 --> 01:15:11.303
They get it, stop
talking to them.

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:17.007
As much as I love
portraying Sir Kerouac,

01:15:17.009 --> 01:15:17.943
I gotta admit,

01:15:19.445 --> 01:15:20.279
words,

01:15:21.947 --> 01:15:23.115
and the act of writing,

01:15:24.183 --> 01:15:26.250
only point towards reality.

01:15:26.252 --> 01:15:27.353
Jack!

01:15:29.288 --> 01:15:30.656
They never get there.

01:15:32.291 --> 01:15:33.125
Got that?

01:15:39.765 --> 01:15:40.764
What are you doin'?

01:15:40.766 --> 01:15:41.999
Checkin' me out or somethin'?

01:15:42.001 --> 01:15:43.002
Get outta here.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.217
Who is Sam Zander?

01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:43.253
I wanted to post this
video today to let you guys

01:17:43.255 --> 01:17:44.855
know I'm taking a
break from my channel.

01:17:44.857 --> 01:17:47.190
Not because I'm gonna stop
searching for the truth,

01:17:47.192 --> 01:17:51.030
but because in a way, I feel
like maybe I already found it.

01:17:52.498 --> 01:17:54.598
It was a famous French
writer who once said,

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.302
"I tore myself away from
the comfort of certainties

01:17:58.304 --> 01:18:01.307
"through my love for truth,
and truth rewarded be."

01:18:02.374 --> 01:18:04.910
Her name was Simone de Beauvoir.

01:18:06.278 --> 01:18:07.944
If she's out there
listening somewhere,

01:18:07.946 --> 01:18:10.180
I just wanna let her
know that I'm sorry.

01:18:10.182 --> 01:18:12.584
Maybe, maybe she can forgive me.

01:18:15.287 --> 01:18:17.356
Also, I left my lights on,

01:18:18.658 --> 01:18:20.357
and I could really
use a jump start.

01:18:25.366 --> 01:18:27.531
