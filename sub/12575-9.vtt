PEGGY: Now, Minh, the game of Boggle
is really quite simple.

00:34.867 --> 00:38.325
The goal is to make words out of
these 25 letter cubes.

00:40.572 --> 00:42.267
<i>Bametomyam.</i>

00:42.341 --> 00:44.400
It's gotta be a real word, honey.

00:44.476 --> 00:47.377
<i>Yes. Bametomyam.
Thai spicy noodle soup.</i>

00:47.513 --> 00:48.741
Tasty and delicious.

00:51.183 --> 00:55.813
<i>I tell you, I hate to see Nancy cooped
up all Sunday, playing that Boggle.</i>

00:56.088 --> 00:57.680
It's a beautiful day.

00:57.756 --> 01:00.350
<i>She ought to be outside,
hanging my laundry.</i>

01:00.426 --> 01:03.293
<i>ANNOUNCER: Sunday! Sunday!
And Saturday.</i>

01:03.362 --> 01:05.728
<i>It's the 9th Annual Dallas Mower Expo.</i>

01:05.798 --> 01:10.258
<i>Be there, as the biggest names in mowers
unveil the latest grass-cutting technology.</i>

01:10.336 --> 01:13.601
<i>Thrill to the spectacle of
the Snapper Precision-Mowing Team!</i>

01:13.672 --> 01:17.199
<i>See King Mulch take on
a Texas-sized pile of twigs!</i>

01:17.276 --> 01:20.006
<i>Over 10,000 oil paintings must be sold!</i>

01:20.079 --> 01:24.243
<i>Don't miss the Dallas Mower Expo!
Be there!</i>

01:25.718 --> 01:28.881
PEGGY: "Pad Thai" doesn't count, Minh.
I guess I win again.

01:28.988 --> 01:32.788
Boy, Aunt Peg, the words I don't know
could fill a dictionary.

01:32.858 --> 01:37.056
The Elks are having a Boggle tournament
to raise bail money for their treasurer.

01:37.129 --> 01:38.528
Maybe you should enter.

01:38.597 --> 01:41.031
Me? Oh, fish. I just play for fun.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.896
Minh, you owe me $13.

01:42.968 --> 01:47.701
Thank you for Boggle lesson, Peggy Hill.
Maybe next week I teach you mahjong.

01:47.873 --> 01:49.431
Bring your checkbook!

01:49.508 --> 01:53.000
Hank, I'm thinking of entering
a Boggle tournament over at the Elks.

01:53.078 --> 01:56.377
Boggle? Boy, the Elks will do
anything for a dollar.

01:56.448 --> 02:00.817
Are they still playing that game where
the cow's gotta drop dung in a square?

02:00.886 --> 02:04.845
Boggle is nothing like Cow Bingo, Hank.
Boggle is a game of wits.

02:04.923 --> 02:07.289
Now, Cow Bingo is a game of strategy.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.319
Hoo-yeah!

02:15.601 --> 02:19.196
All right, Peggy, I replaced
my watch battery, ate a Cinnabon...

02:19.271 --> 02:22.672
and bought a P-trap.
I can't kill any more time. Let's go.

02:22.741 --> 02:25.141
<i>Shh, Hank. It is only Round 5.</i>

02:27.479 --> 02:28.810
"Impatient."

02:30.983 --> 02:33.918
Okay, that's time. Pencils down.
Let's tote 'em up.

02:33.986 --> 02:38.582
I hope you don't mind, but I only used
words that appear in Patsy Cline lyrics.

02:46.865 --> 02:47.957
Okay.

02:48.467 --> 02:49.491
Hoo-yeah!

02:49.568 --> 02:52.162
Boy, that wife of yours is pretty good.

02:52.237 --> 02:55.434
I guess that's why they call her
your better half.

02:55.607 --> 02:57.336
Who calls her that?

02:57.976 --> 02:59.068
They.

02:59.144 --> 03:02.170
And I hope that your leg
gets better real soon...

03:02.247 --> 03:04.112
Zachary Quinn Jr.

03:06.151 --> 03:07.846
MAN: How does she do it?

03:09.354 --> 03:11.515
LUANNE: Oh, my goodness!
Congratulations!

03:11.590 --> 03:12.784
BOBBY: You won, Mom!

03:12.858 --> 03:16.487
Looks like someone is gonna have to
clear some room on his trophy shelf.

03:16.562 --> 03:19.497
HANK: Hey, easy, Peggy.
That's my MVP trophy.

03:19.631 --> 03:22.065
Mom's trophy is bigger than yours.

03:22.801 --> 03:24.928
Oh, pooh. I don't care about the trophy.

03:25.003 --> 03:29.099
<i>The real honor is getting to represent
Arlen in the State Boggle Championship.</i>

03:29.174 --> 03:32.007
<i>You're going to State? That is so exciting!</i>

03:32.077 --> 03:35.478
<i>Just like when Uncle Hank went
to State for high school football.</i>

03:35.547 --> 03:38.311
Oh, yeah. It's exactly like that, Luanne.

03:38.383 --> 03:42.410
PEGGY: Oh, well, it might not be football,
but there are over 200 competitors...

03:42.488 --> 03:45.753
and you're allowed to bring a coach.
You wanna be my coach?

03:45.824 --> 03:47.883
A Boggle coach? What would I do?

03:47.960 --> 03:50.793
You don't have to do anything.
You just have to be there.

03:50.863 --> 03:53.423
Unless you want me to go off
to Dallas by myself.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.332
Dallas? I don't want you
going to Dallas at all!

03:56.401 --> 03:59.768
That place is crawling
with crackheads and debutantes!

03:59.838 --> 04:01.931
Half of them play for the Cowboys.

04:02.007 --> 04:05.704
<i>Come on, Hank. It's just for the weekend.
We'll be back on Sunday.</i>

04:05.878 --> 04:08.642
<i>ANNOUNCER: Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!</i>

04:08.947 --> 04:13.111
Guess who's going to the mower show?
If you guess right, you can come with me.

04:13.185 --> 04:15.676
It's you. Right? Did I win?

04:15.921 --> 04:17.286
Am I going?

04:17.356 --> 04:19.880
Boy, how'd you manage
to swing that with Peggy?

04:19.958 --> 04:22.756
<i>She don't like mowers
like we like mowers.</i>

04:22.828 --> 04:25.524
<i>Simple. I found
a Boggle tournament in Dallas...</i>

04:25.597 --> 04:27.929
to keep her busy,
while we have some real fun.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.969
Check it out, man. Talk about road trip.
The Big D Motel, man.

04:31.036 --> 04:34.767
You're talking about "The biggest names
in mowers and clippers! Be there!"

04:34.840 --> 04:36.740
Man, it's gonna be fun.

04:38.810 --> 04:42.644
Let's go, Peggy! We gotta get to Dallas
before the gangs wake up!

04:42.714 --> 04:45.615
<i>PEGGY: Hank! Shh! It's 4:00 a.m.</i>

04:46.151 --> 04:47.982
Can I go back to bed, Aunt Peggy?

04:48.053 --> 04:51.545
I need to get eight hours of beauty sleep
and then write a paper on it.

04:51.623 --> 04:54.387
In a minute, honey.
Now, it is very important...

04:54.459 --> 04:56.552
that we know we can trust you two.

04:56.628 --> 04:58.994
Now, no parties while we're gone.

04:59.064 --> 05:00.156
Okay.

05:00.532 --> 05:01.760
Bye-bye.

05:02.601 --> 05:06.264
 On behalf
of the Arlen Boggle Boosters...

05:06.338 --> 05:09.136
I'd like to present you with this jacket.

05:09.374 --> 05:11.342
Good luck, Peggy! W-l-N!

05:12.344 --> 05:16.678
<i>I promise to make Dairy King,
Mr. Lube, and Rivera Sump Pumps proud!</i>

05:16.815 --> 05:20.478
This weekend, Peggy Hill is gonna
put Arlen, Texas, on the map!

05:20.552 --> 05:23.783
Okay, Peggy Hill.
Good luck and maybe goodbye.

05:23.855 --> 05:24.844
Maybe?

05:24.923 --> 05:28.723
Where I come from, either you come home
a winner or you not come home at all!

05:28.794 --> 05:31.262
Good luck, Peggy Hill. Goodbye.

05:55.587 --> 05:58.283
<i>- What are you watching?
- Risky Business.</i>

05:58.423 --> 06:01.915
Luanne, that movie's got bad words
and adult situations.

06:02.094 --> 06:04.927
Not anymore. I rented it at Blockbuster.

06:05.797 --> 06:10.427
I also got a fire-safety video
starring Chuck Mangione! Want to watch?

06:10.502 --> 06:13.835
No, thanks. I'm kinda
in the middle of doing laundry.

06:13.905 --> 06:15.964
Okay. But remember...

06:16.041 --> 06:19.533
Chuck says,
"Always unplug your iron after use."

06:19.611 --> 06:21.078
BOBBY: Thanks for the tip.

06:28.954 --> 06:32.822
It's okay, honey. Valet parking is
included in the price of the room.

06:32.891 --> 06:35.223
I don't like the looks of this one, Peggy.

06:35.294 --> 06:38.195
He's just itching
to take my truck for a joyride.

06:44.836 --> 06:46.098
PEGGY: Oh, Hank!

06:48.840 --> 06:50.865
<i>It's lovely. Look at that.</i>

06:52.511 --> 06:56.709
Look, everyone. It's Peggy Hill.
Boggle champ of Arlen, Texas.

07:01.353 --> 07:04.447
JOAN: I'm Joan,
Boggle Hospitality Coordinator.

07:04.523 --> 07:08.926
Here's your tournament tote bag,
a schedule of events, and a Boggle lei.

07:12.164 --> 07:14.428
Joan, this is my husband, Hank.

07:14.499 --> 07:18.799
Wonderful! We have tons of activities
to occupy you while Peggy plays Boggle.

07:18.870 --> 07:22.431
You look like you could use a wallet.
Would you like to make a wallet?

07:23.075 --> 07:26.845
I don't think so.
Harley Davidson already made one for me.

07:26.978 --> 07:30.106
Now, Hank is not just my husband.
He is also my coach.

07:30.181 --> 07:33.014
Well, then you'll be needing one of these.

07:35.553 --> 07:38.750
Come on, Peggy. There's a Parker Brother
I want you to meet.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.885
<i>TV: So take it from me, Chuck Mangione...</i>

07:42.961 --> 07:45.657
<i>unplugging the iron feels so good!</i>

07:45.730 --> 07:47.254
<i>Can you dig it?</i>

07:50.702 --> 07:52.693
LUANNE: Bobby, wait! Use a coaster!

07:52.770 --> 07:53.759
Uh-oh.

07:55.773 --> 07:59.971
What have you done?
That coffee table is trashed!

08:00.044 --> 08:03.411
Your parents trusted us, Bobby,
and we let them down.

08:03.982 --> 08:07.543
They won't be home for 48 hours!
I'll think of something.

08:08.553 --> 08:11.181
Hey, I got it! You think of something.

08:11.589 --> 08:14.217
HANK: I'm checking in.
The name's Hank Hill.

08:15.860 --> 08:19.853
- Nope, I have a Peggy Hill.
- Yeah, that's it. Hank and Peggy Hill.

08:19.931 --> 08:21.489
I have a Peggy Hill.

08:21.566 --> 08:22.897
<i>She's my wife!</i>

08:22.967 --> 08:26.130
Oh, okay. "Mr. And Mrs. Peggy Hill."

08:26.204 --> 08:28.069
Now, you listen to me!

08:28.139 --> 08:31.597
The name is Hank Hill! Mr. Hank Hill!

08:31.910 --> 08:34.538
Peggy married me! I didn't marry her!

08:35.113 --> 08:37.081
What are you looking at?

08:38.249 --> 08:40.649
Oh, look, Peggy, it's Cissy Cobb...

08:40.717 --> 08:44.347
<i>Boggle champion of Dallas
for seven non-consecutive years.</i>

08:45.790 --> 08:48.281
PEGGY: Oh, excuse me, Cissy.

08:48.359 --> 08:50.884
I am fellow Boggle champ, Peggy Hill.

08:50.962 --> 08:55.524
My, my. What an interesting jacket.
Did you patch that together yourself?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.626
Actually, it was given to me
by the Arlen Boggle Boosters.

08:58.703 --> 09:01.103
They got local businesses
to sponsor my trip.

09:01.172 --> 09:03.834
Oh, how exciting.

09:04.175 --> 09:07.941
Why, you're at the very beginning
of a rags-to-riches story.

09:13.751 --> 09:17.346
BOBBY: Okay. The guy at Home Depot
said all we gotta do...

09:17.422 --> 09:20.619
is strip, sand, varnish, buff, varnish...

09:20.692 --> 09:22.785
<i>buff, varnish, wax, buff.</i>

09:22.860 --> 09:26.557
Oh, God! Your parents are gonna
be home in 47 hours! Hurry!

09:27.632 --> 09:28.656
No!

09:32.470 --> 09:33.994
BOBBY: That was close.

09:39.377 --> 09:41.277
BURNETT: Why, hello there, Peggy Hill.

09:41.379 --> 09:44.314
Name's Burnett,
Cissy Cobb's husband-coach.

09:44.382 --> 09:45.815
Actually, my name...

09:45.883 --> 09:48.909
You don't have to explain.
I got an uncle named Leslie.

09:48.987 --> 09:52.115
And the Duke himself, John Wayne,
was really named Marion.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.418
You take that back!

09:55.360 --> 09:58.727
BOBBY: The stain's not coming out!
I'm gonna put it on high.

10:13.478 --> 10:14.740
PEGGY: Oh, Hank.

10:15.513 --> 10:19.677
I have dreamt of this moment
ever since I reached ages-8-and-up.

10:19.984 --> 10:23.886
<i>Yeah. So I'll see you at dinner.
I gotta get to the mower show.</i>

10:24.522 --> 10:28.424
You can't leave now.
You are my coach. I need you.

10:28.659 --> 10:31.924
<i>You, of all people, should understand,
I am at State.</i>

10:32.563 --> 10:34.190
This is my moment.

10:34.298 --> 10:37.859
You know, when I close my eyes,
I see myself in the winner's circle.

10:37.935 --> 10:41.803
And you are right there next to me.
My coach. My man.

10:42.073 --> 10:46.134
And we drive back to Arlen
with that big-ass Boggle trophy...

10:46.210 --> 10:50.374
mounted on the hood of your old truck
like some beautiful, gold-plated...

10:50.448 --> 10:52.848
bare-breasted, Rolls Royce angel!

10:53.651 --> 10:57.451
Well, when I close my eyes,
I see myself at the mower show...

10:57.955 --> 11:02.221
and you're there, too,
like some beauty queen of yore...

11:02.293 --> 11:06.059
wearing a fur coat and a gold hat.

11:07.298 --> 11:09.061
Oh, all right! I'll stay.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.567
<i>EMCEE: Coaches, please
clear the gaming floor!</i>

11:11.636 --> 11:15.663
Oh, I forgot. Coaches have to watch
from a closed-circuit TV room.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.230
Hold my purse?

11:38.696 --> 11:40.926
Well, hello, Patches.

11:41.365 --> 11:44.095
You must be here for your Boggle lesson.

11:44.836 --> 11:46.827
<i>EMCEE: Bogglers, take your marks!</i>

11:48.773 --> 11:50.035
Oh, yeah.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.623
Vowel cubes are running cold.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.427
Coaches note.
It's a good day for "sometimes Y."

12:18.736 --> 12:23.230
Hey, Cobb, for $7.50, I can ride
the mower that cut the Grassy Knoll.

12:23.908 --> 12:28.368
"Patina, pendant, panoply, and lobster."

12:28.913 --> 12:31.438
Cissy Cobb, 73 points!

12:31.649 --> 12:33.947
Peggy Hill, your words, please.

12:35.286 --> 12:36.378
"Dang."

12:37.922 --> 12:41.688
"Dang" is not a word!
That's just some backwoods patois.

12:42.393 --> 12:46.124
Winner, Cissy Cobb! 73-0.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.422
Dang.

12:52.670 --> 12:55.036
I am so stupid!

12:55.907 --> 12:59.365
Oh, you're not stupid.
Heck, you're smarter than me.

12:59.443 --> 13:01.240
Oh, big deal.

13:02.613 --> 13:05.309
Well, you're smarter
than anyone else in Arlen.

13:05.616 --> 13:07.447
Well, whoop-dee-doo!

13:07.518 --> 13:10.954
I am the smartest hillbilly
in Hillbilly Town!

13:13.090 --> 13:15.217
I'm trying, Peggy, I just...

13:15.426 --> 13:19.829
You know, Coach said something that
would fire us up when we were behind.

13:20.531 --> 13:21.896
Yeah? What?

13:21.966 --> 13:25.561
Loser! You're a loser!
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?

13:25.636 --> 13:29.834
Well, you should be, 'cause you are dirt!
You make me sick, you big baby!

13:29.907 --> 13:32.535
Baby want a bottle? A big dirt bottle?

13:32.777 --> 13:35.109
Why are you yelling at me?

13:36.581 --> 13:38.708
I'm trying to be your coach!

13:39.650 --> 13:41.413
It's inspiring.

13:41.485 --> 13:44.852
Well, thank you.
'Cause I feel worse than ever.

13:45.356 --> 13:47.551
Well, it worked for the team.

13:47.858 --> 13:50.691
<i>PEGGY: No, it didn't.
You went to State and lost.</i>

13:51.062 --> 13:55.226
Oh, jeez.
I think I need one of those $8 beers.

13:58.769 --> 14:01.567
PEGGY: You were right, Hank. I am a loser.

14:02.173 --> 14:05.438
I am 255 out of 256.

14:05.509 --> 14:08.706
Oh, come on now.

14:18.589 --> 14:21.922
Well, I guess that's my cue.
You want me to hold your purse?

14:21.993 --> 14:25.896
Fine. This shouldn't take
very long anyway.

14:27.497 --> 14:29.897
BILL: Wow, would you look at this place?

14:29.966 --> 14:32.628
I feel like the Pretty Woman.

14:35.405 --> 14:36.497
DALE: Hank?

14:36.706 --> 14:38.173
Oh! Hi, guys.

14:40.176 --> 14:43.612
- What are you doing with that purse?
- I'm holding it for Peggy.

14:44.247 --> 14:45.236
Uh-huh.

14:45.415 --> 14:48.543
Come on, man.
We're missing the mower show! Let's go!

14:52.255 --> 14:54.382
Well, maybe tomorrow.

14:54.457 --> 14:56.254
What's going on here, Hank?

14:56.326 --> 15:00.456
I got a pretty good dang old idea what's
going on. I tell you what, man. It's a...

15:01.798 --> 15:06.292
Two days ago, you were like a little boy,
all excited about the mower show.

15:06.569 --> 15:09.800
Now, you're this strange man
holding a purse.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.234
Which is it, Hank?

15:11.308 --> 15:14.505
Are you some kind of man?
Or are you a little boy?

15:14.577 --> 15:16.875
I am still a little boy, damn it!

15:16.947 --> 15:21.350
And I am still excited about going
to the mower show. Come on, let's go!

15:28.725 --> 15:30.590
Winner, Peggy Hill!

15:30.660 --> 15:34.187
Oh, I don't believe it!
You played a great game.

15:38.568 --> 15:41.833
<i>ANNOUNCER: And on display in
Booth 5, the blade from Slingblade.</i>

15:44.607 --> 15:47.337
DALE: "Liberace's Mower,
no flash photography."

15:57.554 --> 16:01.513
BOBBY: You sure you can get that
ring out? I can't afford any more screwups.

16:01.591 --> 16:05.584
I just spent my last dollar
on deodorizing carpet sealant.

16:07.430 --> 16:10.627
What color is that? Is that Eggshell White?

16:10.900 --> 16:13.266
<i>It's gotta be Swiss Coffee!</i>

16:14.037 --> 16:15.163
Oh, baby!

16:16.639 --> 16:18.368
Oh, man!

16:28.418 --> 16:30.147
Winner, Peggy Hill!

16:31.421 --> 16:33.514
Winner, Peggy Hill!

16:34.924 --> 16:37.017
Winner, Peggy Hill!

16:38.628 --> 16:40.721
I did it! Guess what, Hank?

16:40.797 --> 16:42.890
<i>We are going to the finals!</i>

16:46.469 --> 16:50.462
Look at old Boomhauer,
rolling and dodging and such.

16:50.874 --> 16:53.468
<i>BOOMHAUER: Dang! Somebody
pick up that dang old rock!</i>

16:53.543 --> 16:58.207
I tell you, I haven't had this much fun
since our last football road trip.

16:58.581 --> 17:00.879
<i>Remember? When we went to State?</i>

17:00.950 --> 17:03.475
And even old Peg was there. Remember?

17:03.553 --> 17:05.180
Yeah, I remember.

17:05.355 --> 17:08.790
Cheering her heart out
when we were down 28-0.

17:14.631 --> 17:17.691
Man, this dang old piece of crap.
Dang old blocked up.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.894
Get the grass out. There it is.

17:21.037 --> 17:22.231
I ain't got no fingers!

17:23.673 --> 17:26.141
JOAN: I'm sorry, Peggy.
We have to start the finals.

17:26.209 --> 17:29.337
Okay. As soon as I find my husband.
I mean, coach.

17:29.446 --> 17:32.040
He's probably just refilling my rosin bag.

17:32.115 --> 17:36.381
<i>CISSY: Don't kid yourself. He's probably
too embarrassed to watch me beat you.</i>

17:36.453 --> 17:37.818
PEGGY: Cissy Cobb?

17:38.421 --> 17:40.946
That's right, Patches!

17:41.324 --> 17:44.088
Looks like it's you and me in the finals.

17:46.129 --> 17:47.221
Hank?

17:47.430 --> 17:50.558
<i>BRENT: Hello, and welcome
to the Texas State Boggle Championships.</i>

17:50.633 --> 17:54.467
<i>We're coming to you live on the
Dallas Grand Plaza Hospitality Channel...</i>

17:54.537 --> 17:58.496
<i>I'm Brent Steel and with me
is Boggle grand master, Alexi Golgarin.</i>

17:58.575 --> 18:01.408
<i>Thanks, Brent.
This should be a great final match.</i>

18:01.478 --> 18:03.844
<i>Two great Bogglers.
Only one will be winner.</i>

18:03.913 --> 18:06.939
All right, it's gonna be best of three.
I want a clean game.

18:07.016 --> 18:09.917
<i>No foreign words.
No foreign objects. Shake!</i>

18:14.557 --> 18:15.751
PEGGY: Oh, Hank.

18:15.825 --> 18:18.851
<i>BRENT: Cissy Cobb is off
to an excellent start in Round 1.</i>

18:18.928 --> 18:20.520
<i>ALEXl: Peggy Hill hesitated.</i>

18:20.597 --> 18:23.998
<i>That's going to cost her
at least a four-letter word.</i>

18:24.334 --> 18:26.632
<i>BRENT: There goes Peggy Hill's pencil!</i>

18:26.936 --> 18:29.928
<i>ALEXl: With no coach,
she's really at a disadvantage.</i>

18:32.542 --> 18:36.444
<i>BRENT: Incredible!
What a scrapper! What a save!</i>

18:38.715 --> 18:42.310
<i>BRENT: The players will now read their
word lists, starting with Peggy Hill.</i>

18:43.219 --> 18:46.655
<i>"Sad, abandoned, abandons...</i>

18:46.956 --> 18:48.924
<i>"bad, man..."</i>

18:54.931 --> 18:57.764
<i>BRENT: We're in the final round
of this championship match...</i>

18:57.834 --> 18:59.324
<i>and Peggy Hill is far behind.</i>

18:59.402 --> 19:00.562
Peggy!

19:01.738 --> 19:04.366
<i>ALEXl: Peggy Hill is down
to her last pencil.</i>

19:04.440 --> 19:06.931
<i>She has no more pencils in reserve.</i>

19:07.343 --> 19:10.369
<i>Everything rides on this pencil!</i>

19:12.215 --> 19:15.878
<i>BRENT: This is awful.
I think it's all over for Peggy Hill.</i>

19:21.858 --> 19:24.349
Hank! Where the hell have you been?

19:24.427 --> 19:28.454
It doesn't matter where I've been.
I figured out where I should be.

19:28.531 --> 19:31.659
Now, let's show them
how we play Boggle in Arlen!

19:31.734 --> 19:33.702
Whatever you say, Coach!

19:36.973 --> 19:37.962
Hoo-yeah!

20:02.498 --> 20:05.763
<i>BRENT: Peggy Hill was writing up a storm.
But will it be enough?</i>

20:06.669 --> 20:10.002
"Caviar, chinchilla, harpsichord."

20:13.543 --> 20:16.842
<i>ALEXl: What confidence.
She wrote "harpsichord."</i>

20:16.913 --> 20:19.848
<i>But not "harp" and not "chord."</i>

20:20.650 --> 20:22.379
<i>A very bold gambit.</i>

20:24.821 --> 20:27.619
"Fish, fishes, slaw..."

20:27.690 --> 20:30.215
<i>BRENT: Peggy Hill is using
the opposite strategy.</i>

20:30.293 --> 20:32.853
<i>A long list of short words
to narrow the gap.</i>

20:32.929 --> 20:34.692
"...churn, churns...

20:34.897 --> 20:36.797
"apron, aprons..."

20:36.866 --> 20:40.700
<i>BRENT: She needs 10 more points,
and she only has one word remaining.</i>

20:42.071 --> 20:43.265
"Ain't"?

20:44.874 --> 20:47.843
"Ain't" is not a word! I win!

20:49.779 --> 20:54.341
It ain't "ain't," Cissy Cobb.
The word is "acquaintanceship"...

20:54.517 --> 20:58.317
as in, "It was not my pleasure
to make your acquaintanceship."

20:58.388 --> 20:59.548
I win!

21:00.990 --> 21:02.582
<i>BRENT: What an incredible upset!</i>

21:02.659 --> 21:05.321
<i>Peggy Hill is the new
Texas State Boggle champion!</i>

21:05.395 --> 21:09.333
<i>Now, a description of the hotel fire safety
procedures with Chuck Mangione.</i>

21:09.466 --> 21:12.765
You did it, Peggy, just like you said!
You're in the winner's circle!

21:12.836 --> 21:15.100
And you are right beside me, Hank.

21:16.606 --> 21:18.233
Loser! You're a loser!

21:18.308 --> 21:21.106
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?
Well, you should be!

21:21.178 --> 21:25.444
You know, there's something Coach said
he would do if we ever won the big game.

21:25.515 --> 21:27.380
Oh, yeah? What's that?

21:39.763 --> 21:44.029
BOBBY: Let's go! Let's go! My parents
are gonna be home any minute!

21:45.102 --> 21:47.536
What the hell is going on here?

21:52.175 --> 21:54.405
This party is officially over!

21:54.478 --> 21:57.777
You kids get out of here
before I call your parents!

21:57.848 --> 22:01.511
I don't know how you two
could be so irresponsible.

22:01.852 --> 22:03.717
<i>You are both grounded.</i>

22:04.087 --> 22:07.352
What were you thinking?
You've got school tomorrow!
