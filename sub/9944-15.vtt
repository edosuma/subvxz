And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

02:53.740 --> 02:54.855
Karen, where do you want us?

02:54.940 --> 02:58.330
Eh, Karen,
customer complaints, please.

02:58.420 --> 03:01.492
I don't want a todger dodger

Seen it? Fingers like dildos. Equal
rights for gender benders now, is it?

03:06.260 --> 03:08.091

Dex?

Hi.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.970
You look gorgeous.

04:08.900 --> 04:12.370
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.610
D'you know what this
shite does to your lungs?

04:14.700 --> 04:16.815
- Everything all right?
- It's nowt to do with him.

04:16.899 --> 04:21.017
- It's nowt I can't handle.
- Chill out, Mam. Everyone's at it.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.011
Not everyone's got a name
like Karib.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.170
Magistrates are gonna love you!

04:25.260 --> 04:27.410
Worse things he could
be doing, love.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.933
At least he's keeping his head down.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.454
- Who asked you, 'Iove'?
- Ease off.

04:31.540 --> 04:33.929
Best way with teens.

04:34.020 --> 04:37.456
Pull on the reins, and they'll bolt.
Fact.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.814
Where did you get it?

04:38.900 --> 04:42.097
Bit of weed! He's bound
to dabble at some point.

04:42.180 --> 04:44.455
- You'd know all about that!
- Meaning?

04:44.540 --> 04:46.929
If you've given him one
crumb of that shite...

04:47.020 --> 04:49.409
You'd better watch your gob, lady.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.058
I don't supply kids.

04:51.140 --> 04:54.450
Where did you get it from?
Did you get it off of her?

04:54.540 --> 04:56.098
Don't be stupid!

05:11.820 --> 05:13.253
Can't decide.

05:16.220 --> 05:18.814
I am starving.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.094
All sounds gorgeous.

05:20.180 --> 05:23.252
Is it just me,
or is it quiet in here?

05:23.340 --> 05:24.216
Like we should whisper!

05:24.300 --> 05:26.291
Yeah!

05:26.380 --> 05:27.859
I had a list of questions in my head.

05:27.940 --> 05:29.737
In case we ran
out of things to say?

05:29.820 --> 05:30.889
Yeah.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.169
Ask me something.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.569
We haven't run out
of things to say yet.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.059
Anything.

05:38.140 --> 05:39.255
All right.

05:41.220 --> 05:45.293
How come you're single?
A darling like you.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.612
The early pit-bull
catches the rabbit.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.329
Shane! Twat.

05:56.420 --> 05:59.651
- It was an accident. I'm sorry.
- <i>You're</i> the accident.

05:59.740 --> 06:02.129
Ever thought about running away?

06:02.220 --> 06:05.132
Or getting a proper job?
That'd be an idea.

06:05.220 --> 06:08.178
< It's always the ones you love
the most that get all the shit.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.296
It's hard enough making
it look equal with two.

06:10.380 --> 06:11.938
What are you on about?

06:12.020 --> 06:14.580
I don't know how you
manage it with your tribe.

06:14.660 --> 06:15.888
What does she mean, Mam?

06:15.980 --> 06:21.532
All this! Insults, violence.
You must be the favourite.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.338
Yeah.

06:23.420 --> 06:24.853
Shut the fuck up, gimp.

06:24.940 --> 06:29.411
See? You've gotta cover it somehow.
It's not fair on the others. Come on!

06:29.500 --> 06:31.491
Enough's enough.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.093
Give the lad a love.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.337
Breathe a word and I'll break
your neck.

06:41.420 --> 06:42.853
Yeah.

06:49.180 --> 06:52.855
- Shall we get another bottle?
- Push the boat out.

06:52.940 --> 06:55.579
Thanks, mate.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.332
Two kinds of chips!

06:57.420 --> 06:59.138
Yeah. It's bollocks, isn't it?

06:59.220 --> 07:01.370
You can tell I've not
been out in ages.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.212
It's not easy
when you've got a kid.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.256
Yeah.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.020
- So who's minding her?
- Mum and Dad.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.979
Don't have to talk
about her, you know.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.652
No, I want to.

07:14.740 --> 07:15.934
Johnny's at my mam's.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.817
- Who's Johnny?
- My son.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.698
Oh. What's he like?

07:20.780 --> 07:23.578
Hard work. Like I said.

07:26.660 --> 07:30.448
Used to think people who went
on blind dates were desperate.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.929
It's a bit different to
a blind date, though.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.693
When I saw your picture,

07:35.780 --> 07:37.771
I was well up for it.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.930
What picture?

07:47.420 --> 07:48.853
Oh, shit.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.057
(Jamie) 'Mandy's worked out he's not
my mate. She's on the warpath.'

08:01.140 --> 08:02.209
You'd better come home then.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.052
'I'm just warning ya, that's all.'

08:04.140 --> 08:08.770
I'm not taking all the shit.
It was you and lan that did this.

08:08.860 --> 08:13.217
I said, come home! Jamie?

08:19.380 --> 08:22.292
- Good night?
- Internet date.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.769
- Why did you lie to me?
- It was Jamie and lan's idea.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.091
- You told me he was Jamie's mate!
- We thought he was the best match.

08:28.180 --> 08:28.896
Thought?

08:28.980 --> 08:30.732
I'm having a limo party this Sunday >

08:30.820 --> 08:32.970
if you're up for a
good night, ladies.

08:33.059 --> 08:36.450
He was dead keen. Loads were.
You had like 20-odd hits.

08:36.539 --> 08:39.293
Bit of PR to drum up business.

08:39.380 --> 08:43.578
Desperate single parents. com?
What did they put?

08:43.659 --> 08:46.697
Lonely mother of one seeks unattached
bore for nights in playing Scrabble?

08:46.780 --> 08:50.489
Where's lan? He'll come.
Limo party, Sunday.

08:50.580 --> 08:52.218
- Is he boring?
- You know what I mean.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.289
Did you fancy him?

08:53.380 --> 08:56.656
Irrelevant.
Ritual humiliation's dealt with that.

08:56.740 --> 08:57.775
Lillian?

08:57.860 --> 09:01.853
- What did they put?
- That you're great, up for a laugh.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.814
Dex, this is Karen.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.812
I'm sorry.
Shouldn't have lied.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.860
I'm glad you did. Really.

09:19.180 --> 09:21.296
Ha ha! Got ya!

09:21.380 --> 09:24.178
You dick! You want a drink?

09:24.260 --> 09:27.297
You're always welcome here,
if it gets too much at home.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.690
Sorry about my mam.
And thanks for sticking up for me.

09:35.340 --> 09:38.013
Twice as good as the shit
you've been getting.

09:39.260 --> 09:43.856
- Yeah?
- On me, love. Keep it schtum.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.209
Vodkas, please.

10:10.580 --> 10:13.970
- Seems dead keen.
- Yeah, he's nice. I like him.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.814
Let your hair down for once.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.618
Upstairs is free.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.659

- Ladies first.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.055
Sit down. >

11:15.180 --> 11:17.978
Uh-huh. You're going nowhere.

11:24.140 --> 11:26.210
- Again?
- Yeah.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.938
I need some water.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.578
Can't handle your beer
or can't handle me?

12:06.660 --> 12:08.651
Dex?

12:11.140 --> 12:12.573
Wake up!

12:14.980 --> 12:16.698

12:17.980 --> 12:19.333
Dex?

12:24.140 --> 12:25.812
Jesus Christ!

12:39.900 --> 12:40.969
She's fast asleep.

12:48.180 --> 12:52.332
30 years since our first date,
you're still exactly the same.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.456
Happy anniversary, babes.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.610

No pulse.

13:05.460 --> 13:06.939
What have you done?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.373
- Nothing!
- Did you shock him?

13:08.460 --> 13:11.896
- When did that kill anyone?
- What did you eat?

13:11.980 --> 13:13.208
Steak.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.211
- Peanuts?
- No.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.770
It must be summat.
What's the last thing that he ate?

13:18.860 --> 13:20.418
The E.

SIREN WAILS

13:29.020 --> 13:30.453
You haven't?

13:33.580 --> 13:36.652
I'm sorry. I honestly
thought he'd swallowed his tongue.

13:36.740 --> 13:41.495
He still owes us two canisters of
Entonox from last time, the twat.

She even searched my mates.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.331
She doesn't half worry.

14:06.420 --> 14:10.857
She's not like you two.
You're chilled. Dead reasonable.

14:10.940 --> 14:12.498
< Proper parents.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.055
Best film ever made.

14:18.140 --> 14:20.734
The only place you could get
privacy then was the pictures.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.412
And baby-sitting. >

14:22.500 --> 14:24.934
That couple we used to sit for
down your road...

14:25.020 --> 14:26.578
Complete tit-heads.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.378
- And their son.
- Nice lad.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.850
Nice?! Little shit
wouldn't go to bed.

14:31.940 --> 14:32.690
That's kids for ya.

14:32.780 --> 14:37.058
Kept interrupting.
Insisted on sitting between us.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.051
Didn't you have to pay him off?

14:44.780 --> 14:47.169
Thanks.
Enjoy the rest of your night.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.097

We're in so much shit.

15:20.100 --> 15:20.896
We?!

15:20.980 --> 15:22.174
You supplied it. It's manslaughter!

15:22.260 --> 15:23.852
You gave it to him.

15:23.940 --> 15:26.010
They'll want to know where I got it.

15:26.100 --> 15:29.456
We worked our arses off for
this place. He can't go back down.

15:29.540 --> 15:30.973
And what about me?
I can't leave Katie.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.335
Your mam's, to start with.

15:33.420 --> 15:36.571
You know, Jamie'd take the rap
for it, though, wouldn't he?

15:41.380 --> 15:42.972
We've gotta move him.

TAPE RIPS

16:06.460 --> 16:08.132
Careful!

16:08.220 --> 16:09.699

Ohh...

16:12.020 --> 16:14.215
What are you doing? Get up!

16:14.300 --> 16:15.130
I can't.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.450
Come on. After three. One...

16:17.540 --> 16:18.768
SNORING

16:18.860 --> 16:20.259
What's that? >

16:22.060 --> 16:23.732
He's dead to the world.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.608
Quick, come on.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.179
Hide!

16:36.260 --> 16:42.779
# <i>Sonny, the summer's gone</i>

16:44.220 --> 16:48.099
# <i>And all the leaves are falling</i>

16:48.180 --> 16:49.977
# <i>'Tis you will stay...</i>

16:53.340 --> 16:57.128
# <i>'Tis you must go</i>
<i>and I will stay...</i> #

16:57.220 --> 16:58.778
THEY LAUGH

17:27.300 --> 17:29.256
Sorry, babe.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.173
His fault.
He said, one more pint.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.251
Ohhh, he's full of shit!

17:37.620 --> 17:38.689
What?

17:43.460 --> 17:46.896
Her mugshot's
all over that website.

17:48.940 --> 17:52.694
Billy? Get rid of the Es.
All of them!

17:52.780 --> 17:55.089
We'll have to delete the e-mails.

17:55.180 --> 17:57.819
He'll have copies!
...Jim? Yeah.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.698
Snide batch. Offload 'em.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.977
- Where's the rug?
- I put it in the yard.

18:04.060 --> 18:06.528
Go and get rid of it!

18:06.620 --> 18:07.814
Jesus!

18:09.180 --> 18:12.172
You'll have to scrub
the whole pub down.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.772
Been looking for you, mate.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.178
- Don't touch it!
- Let me help ya.

18:25.260 --> 18:26.932
- Leave it!
- I can manage.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.659
I said leave it! It's not worth it.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.333
Is there summat wrong?

18:34.420 --> 18:37.298
Does it look like
there's something wrong?

18:37.380 --> 18:40.019
You need to get out more, mate.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.775
Limo party on Sunday,
if you're up for it.

18:43.860 --> 18:46.135
PHONE RINGS

18:57.220 --> 19:01.054
Ohhh... This better be good.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.495
All right, darling,
won't be a minute.

19:03.580 --> 19:05.491
Morning!

19:05.580 --> 19:07.935
Have you got your purse handy?

19:09.100 --> 19:12.456
Hiya, love.
Do you fancy some breakfast?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.897
Our Jamie's been on.

19:18.980 --> 19:21.972
Bin them. Contaminated, apparently.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.418
You're gonna regret this.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.136
It's probably been six years since
it were cleaned under there,

19:45.220 --> 19:48.178
so I wanna see some effort.
Sweat, if necessary.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.813
Morning, Mrs Thompson.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.255
How you doing, love?
Are you all right?

19:55.340 --> 19:58.457
Good to see you.
Give us a shout if you need 'owt, OK?

19:58.540 --> 20:01.338
It's commerce, Shane,
not Help the fuckin' Aged.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.172
I bet she buys more.

20:03.260 --> 20:04.249
What?

20:04.340 --> 20:07.491
Well, who comes to the till
with one thing in a basket?

20:07.580 --> 20:09.013
It's human nature, Yvonne.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.694
No-one wants to look like
a tight cunt.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.139
State of that!
You'll have to start again.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.893
- It's a jumble-sale effect.
- What?!

20:40.980 --> 20:42.652
Shoppers are drawn to it.
Especially bargain-hunters.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.139
Oh, aye?

20:44.220 --> 20:45.778
Yeah. It's instinctive.

20:45.860 --> 20:50.490
People wanna grab. They don't wanna
mess up summat that's neat and tidy.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.854
People will fill a trolleyload
with this lot.

20:51.940 --> 20:55.216
- Yeah...
- It's another form of OCD.

20:55.300 --> 20:57.530
It's like we all get
little bits of it.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.692
I can't have a shit unless me
bath mat's at a right angle.

21:00.780 --> 21:03.010
Wines and beers.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.854
All along there. Make it look
like a right fucking tip.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.373
You're good.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.052
SIGHS

21:10.140 --> 21:12.131
Arse-licker.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.370
Really good.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.172
Here we go.

21:22.420 --> 21:24.058
Burn. Burn.

21:24.140 --> 21:26.210
Burn.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.289
Burn. Wash.

21:27.380 --> 21:28.369
I bought you that.

21:28.460 --> 21:32.294
Teach you to stick your nose in next
time you think someone's desperate.

21:32.380 --> 21:33.415
Didn't think you
was desperate, Mandy.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.058
Jamie...

23:15.380 --> 23:18.975
Hey! This better not be one
of them job-share thingummy-gigs.

23:19.060 --> 23:22.814
Don't worry, it's temporary.
You're safe.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.811
It's an absolute disgrace,
this country.

23:24.900 --> 23:25.969
That's news(!)

23:26.060 --> 23:28.290
Have you heard? They found a body.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.975
Gunned down in cold blood, poor mite.

23:38.060 --> 23:39.937
I blame the parents.

23:45.180 --> 23:48.775
Chill out, it's not him!
There's no point in going under.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.213
I know, I'm trying!

23:50.300 --> 23:52.655
People will notice!

23:52.740 --> 23:54.412
They'll come here looking first.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.013
So what if they do?

23:56.100 --> 23:57.692
He left drunk.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.338
He fell in a ditch.

24:02.340 --> 24:03.455
I don't wanna lose you.

24:03.540 --> 24:06.008
Hey...

24:06.100 --> 24:08.739
You won't.

24:08.820 --> 24:11.129
You gotta keep it
together for Mandy.

24:11.220 --> 24:14.576
RETCHING

24:25.940 --> 24:28.579
- Idea...
- Go on.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.855
Stay open later.

24:30.940 --> 24:33.295
I've got kids, Shane -
undies to wash, bogs to clean.

24:33.380 --> 24:35.735
I'll do it.
Nick late trade off the garage.

24:35.820 --> 24:36.889
With Christmas puddings?

24:36.980 --> 24:39.255
Perfect for the munchies.

24:39.340 --> 24:40.932
Let me.

24:43.100 --> 24:45.978
You go get yourself some dinner,
if you're gonna be staying late.

24:50.260 --> 24:51.852
She's fucking mint, she is!

24:56.300 --> 24:58.177
Hey!

24:58.260 --> 25:00.569
What's that programme on the telly?

25:00.660 --> 25:02.696
How Clean Is Your Pub!

25:06.100 --> 25:07.852
I can't do this.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.168
You can.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.694
Look at me.

25:11.780 --> 25:16.092
I'll go to the police. I'll tell them
it was me. It was an accident.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.295
They'll know you couldn't
have dumped him alone.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.530
I won't mention you.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.417
They won't just leave it at that.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.333
They'll drag me in.
I haven't even got an alibi.

25:27.660 --> 25:32.939
- Just think of Katie.
- I can't <i>stop</i> thinking about Katie.

25:33.020 --> 25:35.409
< (Frank) Soften the blow of the shame

25:35.500 --> 25:39.015
of having it off with scabby Cilla.
I was only 12.

25:39.100 --> 25:42.615
She had curly teeth and
four grey hairs on her melanoma,

25:42.700 --> 25:48.730
but after 12 pints of this stuff,
no fucking way did I notice.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.259
Happy fucking days.

25:52.340 --> 25:54.615
I'll get you another.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.850
On the house, mate.

25:56.940 --> 25:58.134
(I've got an idea.)

25:58.220 --> 26:00.814
And that was the last time I saw him.

26:00.900 --> 26:04.609
He'd just been blown out. Poor lad.

26:04.700 --> 26:06.053
It was...

26:07.980 --> 26:10.130
You can't blame him
for seeking solace

26:10.220 --> 26:13.371
in the company of an ageing Lothario.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.576
C'est moi. Cheers.

26:17.820 --> 26:19.776
So I offered him a pint...

26:19.860 --> 26:20.929
Good.

26:21.020 --> 26:24.569
Oh, yeah, nice lad, if a tad naive.

26:24.660 --> 26:29.893
He asked my advice on the perils
of the first date.

26:29.980 --> 26:33.097
"Start as you mean to go on, son,"
I said.

26:33.180 --> 26:37.332
"Only an imbecile would tell
a bird to stop talking,

26:37.420 --> 26:41.777
"but to tell her
that her gob is a work of art

26:41.860 --> 26:48.618
"while it is kept firmly shut
are the words of a genius."

26:55.740 --> 26:57.332
Oh, then we left.

26:57.420 --> 27:00.059
FRANK WHINES

27:01.060 --> 27:02.379
Together.

27:05.060 --> 27:08.848
- Then what?
- We went to the chippy.

27:08.940 --> 27:11.090
Lent him a fiver.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.648
We had chips.

27:13.740 --> 27:16.015
He had gravy.

27:16.100 --> 27:23.450
And then I walked him to the bus stop
and that was the last time I saw him.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.690
Come here!

27:25.780 --> 27:27.736
Again?

27:48.380 --> 27:50.496
Work? For her?

27:50.580 --> 27:52.696
I hope it's not performance-related.

27:52.780 --> 27:55.533
She likes what I'm doing.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.053
She likes... me,

27:57.140 --> 27:59.256
I think.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.854
Yeah. And, actually,
I quite like her.

28:01.940 --> 28:05.489
Well, if you tidy yourself up a bit,
you might be in with a chance.

28:05.580 --> 28:06.535
Yeah?

28:06.620 --> 28:09.896
You have got a better barnet
than that Stan, for a start.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.619
They do like
a good head of hair, them lot.

28:13.780 --> 28:16.010
WHISTLE BLOWS

28:19.940 --> 28:21.453
WHISTLE, LOUD MUSIC

28:21.540 --> 28:22.973
What the?

28:23.060 --> 28:24.618
WHISTLE

28:29.980 --> 28:32.096
See you, love.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.292
Got any doilies?

28:38.380 --> 28:40.530
Doing a bit of a PR on Sunday.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.531
Fancy it?

28:46.180 --> 28:49.331
Where the hell d'you get it?!

28:50.260 --> 28:52.649
Sorry... I'll pay.

28:52.740 --> 28:55.379
Promise.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.018
Keep him occupied.

28:57.100 --> 28:59.216
Shall we put the TV on?

28:59.300 --> 29:00.494
Plenty of fluids.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.093
Right.

29:02.180 --> 29:03.533
Fucking love you, Mimi.

29:03.620 --> 29:04.575
I love you, too.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.013
What's up with him?

29:06.100 --> 29:07.658
A bad E.

29:10.180 --> 29:13.013
Here you go, son.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.058
That's it.

29:16.140 --> 29:17.892
Fucking love you, too.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.540
And I love you too, son.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.576
I wish I was your son.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.570
KNOCK AT DOOR
Chesney?! >

29:23.660 --> 29:25.855
Shit!

29:25.940 --> 29:28.170
KNOCK AT DOOR

29:28.260 --> 29:29.329
Chesney, are you in there? >

29:29.420 --> 29:30.375
Hide him!

29:30.460 --> 29:31.449
Where?

29:31.540 --> 29:33.656
Take him for a drive or something.

29:33.740 --> 29:34.695
Quick.

29:37.700 --> 29:38.928
He's gone out with Paddy.

29:39.020 --> 29:40.339
Paddy?

29:40.420 --> 29:43.492
Nothing to do with me if they just
bonded. Kids need a father figure.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.969
Depends who the father figure is.

29:46.060 --> 29:47.493
Meaning?

29:49.100 --> 29:50.499
He'll get bored.

29:56.340 --> 29:57.853
Get your hands off me nuts!

30:00.700 --> 30:04.375
Come to me party if you want, though,
kid. Have as many as you want then.

30:04.460 --> 30:06.769
I fucking love you, Mickey.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.937
I'm sorry, I've lost my appetite.

30:18.140 --> 30:21.450
At least punters
pay if they puke in the limo!

30:21.540 --> 30:24.771
You look after him.
I'm gonna clean meself up.

30:28.180 --> 30:30.569
It's all my fault.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.013
Throwing up's a good thing.

30:32.100 --> 30:36.059
I'd never forgive meself
if anything happened to him.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.019
It's Shane! >

30:42.780 --> 30:44.532
How did it go, then?

30:44.620 --> 30:46.770
Fancy a beer?

30:46.860 --> 30:49.897
Come and park your arse.

30:53.100 --> 30:57.252
Fittest man on the planet!

30:57.340 --> 30:58.614
Oh!

30:58.700 --> 31:00.895
Not afraid to show
his feelings, either.

31:03.140 --> 31:04.653
That's a real man.

31:04.740 --> 31:07.652
I'd love to dance with him.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.936
You need to eat something.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.134
It's not your fault, you know?

31:32.900 --> 31:35.368
There's so much
he said he wanted to do.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.973
What about you?

31:39.380 --> 31:40.335
But he's dead.

31:40.420 --> 31:44.174
You'd be as good as dead,
banged up for the next 20 years.

31:48.820 --> 31:50.731
D'you know what
I always wanted to do?

31:50.820 --> 31:52.617
What?

31:52.700 --> 31:54.053
Learn to play the guitar.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.099
Piano, definitely.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.932
See the pyramids.

32:03.540 --> 32:04.814
Empire State Building.

32:07.540 --> 32:09.417
I thought my luck had changed.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.292
I really liked him, lan.

32:46.620 --> 32:48.497
Are you sure?

32:48.580 --> 32:50.138
Might be the last one I have.

32:51.900 --> 32:55.654
- Gonna hand meself in.
- Why?

32:55.740 --> 32:57.696
We've got a witness.

32:57.780 --> 33:00.169
Call that an alibi?

33:00.260 --> 33:02.330
Can I buy you a drink, Frank?

33:03.740 --> 33:06.015
Christ, does
Dolly Parton sleep on her back?

33:06.100 --> 33:06.816
You're being ridiculous.

33:06.900 --> 33:11.212
Leave her alone,
she's got her own mind!

33:11.300 --> 33:13.530
Pints, Karen. Couple of Es.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.378
Your health.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.654
My health. My God.

33:35.740 --> 33:38.334
Just think about it
before you do anything rash.

33:38.420 --> 33:40.695
Have done.

33:40.780 --> 33:41.974
Nowt else I can do.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.376
Chesney?

33:49.460 --> 33:50.893
He's woken up!

33:53.420 --> 33:54.739
Hiya, love!

33:54.820 --> 33:56.936
Will he be all right?

33:57.020 --> 33:59.295
He's awake, it's a start.

33:59.380 --> 34:02.099
How are you, son?
Do you think he wants anything?

34:02.180 --> 34:03.818
D'you want anything, Chesney?

34:05.740 --> 34:08.379
Shit! Prolapse!

34:09.540 --> 34:12.452
The chances of two people
snuffing it would be tiny, love.

34:12.540 --> 34:13.893
Chesney?

34:13.980 --> 34:15.936
Hey!

34:16.020 --> 34:17.578
Are you with us, son?

34:17.659 --> 34:19.775
Is there anything
that you want, love?

34:22.139 --> 34:25.530
Any chance of a double
cheeseburger and chips?

34:32.659 --> 34:34.491
KNOCKING

34:34.580 --> 34:39.016
If you get this lot cleared away by
tea-time, you can start on them fags.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.658
Then I might let you go home early.

34:40.739 --> 34:41.695
Yvonne...

34:46.659 --> 34:49.219
What the fuck do you think
you look like dressed like that?

34:51.219 --> 34:54.292
My mum will do her tea.

34:54.380 --> 34:56.335
Not fish fingers, though,
she hates them.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.298
- And she'll need a bath.
- You don't have to do this.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.257
Tell Mum no bubbles.
She's still got that rash

35:01.340 --> 35:03.570
on the back of her leg, bless her.

35:08.620 --> 35:11.134
Dex?

35:11.220 --> 35:13.370
Have I walked into
the wrong party or what?

35:18.380 --> 35:19.415
A ditch?

35:19.500 --> 35:20.899
Round the corner from mine.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.938
- It must've felt like shit.
- These dead?

35:29.420 --> 35:33.493
Sometimes when I have an E,
it wipes me out.

35:33.580 --> 35:35.332
So why do you take 'em?

35:35.460 --> 35:36.609
I don't normally.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.611
We were getting on so well.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.531
I didn't want to spoil the night.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.215
So what do you remember?

35:45.300 --> 35:47.291
Just bits.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.496
Remember going upstairs?

35:51.580 --> 35:53.889
That's why I'm here now.

35:56.260 --> 35:58.137
What time did I leave?

35:59.340 --> 36:02.252
Can't remember.
I was pretty messed up too.

36:02.340 --> 36:03.932
Were you angry?

36:04.020 --> 36:06.659
That I wasn't there when you woke up?

36:06.740 --> 36:08.890
It did seem a bit out of order.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.411
So can we...

36:13.500 --> 36:14.694
Can we go out again?

36:16.380 --> 36:18.450
Think you can handle it?

36:22.220 --> 36:24.780
I want you up front with me.
You can start on this.

36:24.860 --> 36:28.011
That stuff's good but it needs elbow
grease, so put your back into it.

36:28.100 --> 36:30.250
I don't want to have
to dock your wages.

36:30.340 --> 36:32.410
Why me?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.411
Shall I do us a brew?

36:34.500 --> 36:35.489
Brilliant.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.211
He's only doing this
to get in your knickers.

36:39.300 --> 36:43.259
- What?!
- Serious. Look at him.

36:43.340 --> 36:44.932
Do you fancy a biccie?

36:53.780 --> 36:56.817
Owt planned for tonight?

36:56.900 --> 36:59.414
- Not much.
- Fancy coming round to mine?

37:01.140 --> 37:02.095
Yeah.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.968
Ever had a threesome?
Me, you and Stan.

37:06.060 --> 37:08.574
He's very open-minded.

37:08.660 --> 37:12.573
Put the closed sign up, Hasselhoff.

37:12.660 --> 37:15.538
What's your policy
on early retirement?

37:20.260 --> 37:23.536
Shame about that, he were good.

37:23.620 --> 37:25.417
It would've only ended in tears.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.569
Nice move.

37:26.660 --> 37:29.254
Don't <i>you</i> get any ideas.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.888
All right. Thanks.

37:33.980 --> 37:37.177
That was our Jamie.

37:37.260 --> 37:39.330
Snide Es, my arse.

37:39.420 --> 37:42.696
The corpse is alive and well.
And buying our Mandy a drink.

37:51.980 --> 37:53.572
See you soon, lad.

37:53.660 --> 37:56.094
I loved it at yours.
You and Paddy are top.

37:59.580 --> 38:03.129
Oi! In!

38:03.220 --> 38:04.733
Here she comes, back to smother yer.

38:04.820 --> 38:08.130
Wrapping them in cotton wool
won't teach them.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.939
The Art of Parenting by Mimi Maguire?
Rush out and buy it,

38:11.020 --> 38:11.975
you might just fuck up your kids.

38:12.060 --> 38:15.575
My kids aren't fucked up!
You wanna take a look at yourself

38:15.660 --> 38:18.618
before you start on me.
It's a struggle for you, isn't it(!)

38:18.700 --> 38:21.009
You try bringing up
two kids in a place like this.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.819
His first words were, "What's a Paki?"
because of likes of you!

38:23.900 --> 38:24.412
Hang on...!

38:24.500 --> 38:27.378
He was beaten up four times
the week he started school!

38:27.460 --> 38:31.214
Meena was expelled from
three schools for starting fights

38:31.300 --> 38:32.972
before they came to batter her!

38:33.060 --> 38:35.699
You think I don't know
about that shit?

38:35.780 --> 38:38.010
One, I'd never say "Paki".

38:38.100 --> 38:43.174
Two, Paddy got lifted that many times
by the coppers

38:43.260 --> 38:46.218
in the first five years
after stepping off that boat,

38:46.300 --> 38:48.689
everyone assumed he was a pub bomber.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.773
She looked after me, Mum.

38:52.860 --> 38:55.897
- He was ill.
- III?

38:55.980 --> 38:57.049
But she fixed me.

38:57.140 --> 38:59.176
Are you OK now?

39:02.380 --> 39:03.779
Thanks for looking after him.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.333
Do you fancy a drink?

39:15.220 --> 39:18.690
Later. Bring Paddy over.

39:18.780 --> 39:20.736
Might.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.651
Think about it.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.535
Same again?

39:35.620 --> 39:36.939
Great.

39:37.020 --> 39:40.217
Hey, Mandy. Is that that dead cunt?

39:41.740 --> 39:42.934
Village idiot.

39:43.020 --> 39:45.329
Frank Gallagher!

39:45.420 --> 39:46.978
You owe me a fiver.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.891
Do I?

39:48.980 --> 39:52.256
Yeah. The other night, remember?

39:52.340 --> 39:55.696
We left here. You and me.

39:55.780 --> 39:58.977
I lent you a fiver.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.857
We had chips.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.976
You had gravy!

40:03.060 --> 40:04.652
I hate gravy.

40:04.740 --> 40:06.139
Must've been shit-faced.

40:06.220 --> 40:10.008
You can say that again! Eh? Lazarus.

40:12.580 --> 40:14.969
Ah! Come to Papa.

40:15.060 --> 40:18.655
Mandy. Word of advice.

40:18.740 --> 40:22.972
Our conscience is that
internal voice that screams...

40:23.060 --> 40:25.016
(Just act like nothing's happened.)

40:25.100 --> 40:30.618
...that some fucker might
just be watching our every move.

40:30.700 --> 40:35.728
Not so dead to the world
after all, eh?

40:40.580 --> 40:41.695
What's he on about?

40:41.780 --> 40:43.498
Nothing. He's just a piss-head.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.691
Come on.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.577
Something's going on here.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.571
In't it?

40:53.660 --> 40:54.888
You can tell me.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.939
We thought you were dead.

41:05.220 --> 41:09.372
So we rolled you up in a rug
and dumped you in a ditch.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.898
Sorry.

41:16.620 --> 41:20.295
I didn't think we had any choice.
I was confused.

41:20.380 --> 41:24.453
At what point did it seem like
a good idea to fucking dump me?

41:24.540 --> 41:26.258
I'm sorry.

41:26.340 --> 41:27.614
Don't be angry with me.

41:27.700 --> 41:28.655
You don't get it.

41:28.740 --> 41:32.050
Can't we just start again?
Put it all behind us?

41:32.140 --> 41:35.098
We were having fun.

41:35.180 --> 41:37.489
It's just too weird. Sorry.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.179
Tell you what.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.573
Maybe I'll give you
a call some time.

41:54.820 --> 41:57.812
If he can't take a joke,
better off without him.

42:06.460 --> 42:08.928
'Ey, Mickey. A guest.

42:11.620 --> 42:14.532
Come in! Sit down.

42:14.620 --> 42:16.576
Grab a vol-au-vent.

42:16.660 --> 42:18.651
Nice carpet.

42:19.780 --> 42:21.213
Help yourself.

42:31.780 --> 42:33.657
Hiya.

42:33.740 --> 42:35.173
Few beers.

42:51.700 --> 42:54.294
(Mandy) 'It's harder for us.
Everybody needs somebody.

42:54.380 --> 42:56.052
'Just got to get on with it.

42:56.140 --> 42:59.655
'Be resourceful.
Makes us twice as capable.

42:59.740 --> 43:01.776
'Got to find an upside somewhere.'

43:01.860 --> 43:03.339
Hi.

43:03.420 --> 43:05.058
Hi.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.574
He's cute.

43:07.660 --> 43:09.252
Takes after his dad.

43:14.900 --> 43:19.496
Been thinking. Could be mates.

43:19.580 --> 43:22.140
(Mandy) 'So what if it's complicated?

43:22.220 --> 43:25.018
'What's the other option?
Sit on your own all your life?

43:25.100 --> 43:26.977
'Give up altogether?

43:27.060 --> 43:29.130
'No chance.'

44:09.260 --> 44:12.172
# <i>You should be dancing, yeah</i>

44:13.300 --> 44:16.849
# <i>Dancing, yeah</i>

44:16.940 --> 44:19.932
# <i>She's juicy and she's trouble</i>

44:20.020 --> 44:23.092
# <i>She gets it to me good</i>

44:24.820 --> 44:28.176
# <i>My woman gives me power</i>

44:28.260 --> 44:30.774
# <i>Goes right down to my blood</i>

44:32.580 --> 44:33.695
# <i>What you doin' on your back?</i>

44:33.780 --> 44:36.374
# <i>Ah</i>

44:36.460 --> 44:37.813
# <i>What you doin' on your back?</i>

44:37.900 --> 44:40.095
# <i>Oh</i>

44:40.180 --> 44:43.570
# <i>You should be dancing, yeah</i>

44:43.660 --> 44:47.016
