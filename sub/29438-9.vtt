00:00.992 --> 00:02.226
Previously on The Resident...

00:02.250 --> 00:03.575
What you're talking about is torture.

00:03.585 --> 00:06.265
All I'm talking about
is this man, who will die

00:06.289 --> 00:09.032
unless Rob Spiro tells us
where he's being held.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.761
- I want no part of it.
- It has to be done.

00:10.785 --> 00:12.286
There's a way we can keep an eye

00:12.295 --> 00:13.954
on each other's surgical practices.

00:13.964 --> 00:17.685
An Ortho-Spine Surgery Center
for comprehensive spine care.

00:17.709 --> 00:20.265
Logan Kim. Exec VP of Red Rock.

00:20.289 --> 00:21.795
I'll be overseeing
the day-to-day operations

00:21.805 --> 00:23.714
- of the hospital now.
- I took an oath.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.192
I get that you would've made
a different choice.

00:25.216 --> 00:26.527
- The right one.
- For you.

00:26.551 --> 00:28.703
But I don't want to be the kind
of doctor you are.

00:28.727 --> 00:31.615
Hawkins is a whistle-blower.
He's a threat to the hospital.

00:31.639 --> 00:32.982
I'll handle it.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.393
Last night I took my date

00:36.403 --> 00:38.122
to that new five-star place on Peachtree.

00:38.146 --> 00:39.457
You went to Manny's?

00:39.481 --> 00:40.958
Oh, I hear it's so good.

00:40.982 --> 00:42.900
Well, it was... until my ex

00:42.909 --> 00:44.929
and her girlfriends
got seated next to us.

00:44.953 --> 00:46.570
- No.
- Those ladies had words for me.

00:48.072 --> 00:49.740
Rongeur.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.825
- BP is dropping.
- I'm almost done.

00:51.835 --> 00:54.388
Just give her another liter of LR.

00:54.412 --> 00:56.557
She's moving.
I'm gonna bolus the propofol.

00:56.581 --> 00:57.831
No, that'll drop her pressures.

00:57.841 --> 00:59.018
Just hang on, I'm almost finished.

01:00.502 --> 01:02.085
- Damn. Tube's out.
- Uh, reintubate.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.256
There's no time. I'll bag her.

01:04.729 --> 01:06.151
Her pressure is falling fast.

01:06.176 --> 01:07.735
She's gonna code, what do we do?

01:07.759 --> 01:08.839
Uh...

01:12.272 --> 01:14.097
911, what is your emergency?

01:14.122 --> 01:17.935
My patient. We need to
get her to a hospital right now.

01:21.198 --> 01:29.206
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

01:32.367 --> 01:33.700
What the hell happened?

01:33.710 --> 01:35.346
A 53-year-old female.

01:35.370 --> 01:37.955
Lost her airway midway through operation

01:37.964 --> 01:39.934
in an outpatient spine surgery center.

01:39.958 --> 01:41.352
- Did they send operative notes?
- Yes.

01:41.376 --> 01:42.770
Her name is Lynette Hughes.

01:42.794 --> 01:44.378
She went in for a spinal fracture.

01:44.387 --> 01:45.546
That's minor.

01:45.555 --> 01:47.381
Let's take a peek.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.444
Okay. One, two, three.

01:50.468 --> 01:52.179
There we go.

01:53.555 --> 01:55.138
Okay, very gently now...

01:55.148 --> 01:57.942
One, two, three.

02:00.904 --> 02:02.396
Bloody hell.

02:02.405 --> 02:04.458
Whatever they started to fix,
they didn't finish.

02:04.482 --> 02:06.377
All right, start her on IV vanc
and cefepime.

02:06.401 --> 02:08.035
Let's get her to CT now.

02:09.246 --> 02:10.904
And my client will stay outside

02:10.913 --> 02:12.633
until you can assure they will have

02:12.657 --> 02:14.876
absolute privacy and security.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.910
I can't clear half the ER
for one patient.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.223
- No matter who they are.
- Everything all right?

02:19.247 --> 02:22.082
No. I need to speak
to his supervisor immediately.

02:22.092 --> 02:24.167
- That'd be me.
- And Dr. Feldman

02:24.177 --> 02:25.921
will tell you the same thing
that I told you.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.255
What he said.

02:29.091 --> 02:30.568
Phoenix on the move.

02:30.592 --> 02:32.726
But... who's the patient?

02:40.610 --> 02:42.246
Can you direct me to "Phoenix"?

02:42.270 --> 02:44.605
ER bay four.

02:44.614 --> 02:46.023
I'm on my way, too.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.168
They called you?

02:48.192 --> 02:50.504
I am the admitting resident. Yes.

02:50.528 --> 02:52.172
Any idea who the patient is?

02:52.196 --> 02:53.864
No. Sounds like they're a big deal.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.010
Not to me. I've been operating

02:56.034 --> 02:57.678
on big shots since I was a resident.

02:57.702 --> 02:59.712
Athletes, celebs, heads
of state... it's all the same.

03:04.375 --> 03:06.937
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you

03:06.961 --> 03:09.179
to Princess Nadine.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.673
Your Highness.

03:11.697 --> 03:13.193
Just Nadine's fine.

03:13.217 --> 03:16.136
My mom's Pakistani but she
married a king while abroad.

03:16.146 --> 03:17.971
Pretty sure they sent me
to the States when I was a kid

03:17.981 --> 03:19.473
so they could have "alone time."

03:20.058 --> 03:22.914
Nadine fainted while jogging
a few hours ago.

03:22.923 --> 03:24.645
No past medical history.

03:24.654 --> 03:27.124
I forgot my water bottle.
Probably just dehydrated.

03:27.148 --> 03:29.627
But Amir's my head of security

03:29.651 --> 03:30.961
and he said we had to come in.

03:30.985 --> 03:32.736
Her head has been hurting for weeks.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.767
It comes and goes.

03:42.664 --> 03:45.165
- You speak Urdu?
- Some.

03:45.175 --> 03:46.667
Yeah, there's overlap with Hindi.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.063
Anything you tell us would help.

03:49.087 --> 03:50.504
Yeah, we'll keep it confidential.

03:51.256 --> 03:54.424
Well, I was running
through Piedmont Park,

03:54.434 --> 03:57.988
and then... I don't know, it was like...

03:58.012 --> 04:01.815
the ground beneath my feet
just disappeared.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.452
She's lost sensation in her feet.

04:08.462 --> 04:11.168
And she's had recent headaches,
dizziness, fevers.

04:11.192 --> 04:13.087
- More than just dehydration.
- No question.

04:13.111 --> 04:14.194
My money's on a stroke or bleed.

04:14.204 --> 04:15.445
Eh, it could be cardiogenic.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.446
Or vascular.

04:16.456 --> 04:19.279
- Get a noncontrast head CT stat.
- I'll ultrasound her carotids.

04:19.303 --> 04:21.178
We should also do
a spinal tap... rule out meningitis

04:21.202 --> 04:22.372
and encephalitis.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.538
Page me when the results come in.

04:25.289 --> 04:27.791
Let's get her settled in one
of our VIP suites.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.271
Thank you. And the princess has
requested that Dr. Pravesh stay

04:31.295 --> 04:33.607
on her medical team
while she's at Chastain.

04:33.631 --> 04:34.807
Thank you.

04:36.968 --> 04:38.195
We good?

04:38.220 --> 04:40.197
You tell me.

04:40.221 --> 04:42.032
You've already established
a connection with the patient.

04:42.056 --> 04:43.100
I think you should stay on.

04:46.403 --> 04:47.871
Incredible.

04:47.895 --> 04:49.396
We can see her perfectly.

04:49.406 --> 04:51.792
And... she looks just like you.

04:53.484 --> 04:55.152
Is she sucking her thumb?

04:55.161 --> 04:56.547
Yes.

04:56.571 --> 04:57.955
Movement is a very good sign.

04:57.979 --> 05:02.159
Mm. Your last trimester has begun.

05:02.168 --> 05:05.556
Soon that little blob will be
crying in your arms.

05:06.748 --> 05:08.331
Have you decided on a name?

05:08.341 --> 05:10.644
Not yet.

05:10.668 --> 05:12.753
For now, let's just call her Michelle.

05:12.762 --> 05:14.966
- Obama?
- You know it.

05:18.342 --> 05:19.737
Oh, all right.

05:19.761 --> 05:21.321
Let's have you sit up.

05:22.772 --> 05:25.492
Lost my breath there for a second.

05:25.516 --> 05:27.077
That's common during pregnancies.

05:27.101 --> 05:28.435
Why don't I give a listen to your heart

05:28.445 --> 05:29.603
and lungs while you're here?

05:29.612 --> 05:30.937
Have you felt like this before?

05:31.565 --> 05:32.939
Sometimes when I'm lying down,

05:32.949 --> 05:34.168
my chest gets a little tight.

05:39.448 --> 05:41.592
I did hear some atypical sounds.

05:41.616 --> 05:42.866
It's probably nothing, but I'd like

05:42.876 --> 05:44.377
to order some more tests just to be safe.

05:44.401 --> 05:46.764
We'll order a few labs,
get a chest X-ray,

05:46.788 --> 05:50.434
and an echo to make sure you
and your little queen are okay.

05:51.042 --> 05:53.604
She does look like me, doesn't she?

05:53.628 --> 05:55.888
Yeah.

05:58.558 --> 06:02.385
We suggest branding this product
by branding you.

06:02.395 --> 06:06.473
That face says strength,
confidence, compassion.

06:06.483 --> 06:07.701
Which one's your favorite?

06:07.725 --> 06:10.310
It's a tough choice. I like 'em all.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.874
We think the third one
shows more... authority.

06:13.898 --> 06:16.126
- In the eyes.
- Exactly.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.878
Am I interrupting?

06:18.800 --> 06:19.943
Yes.

06:20.363 --> 06:23.156
I've been looking for
a new post-workout shake.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.492
This one come in mocha?

06:25.502 --> 06:28.662
Uh, we want you and the product
to be camera ready for the press ASAP.

06:28.671 --> 06:31.141
Yeah, okay, I'll-I'll get back
to you guys later.

06:31.165 --> 06:32.667
That was... That was good.

06:34.502 --> 06:36.845
Thanks, that looks great.

06:40.592 --> 06:41.842
Why are you here?

06:41.851 --> 06:43.237
For the meeting.

06:43.261 --> 06:44.488
For... what meeting?

06:44.512 --> 06:46.156
This one.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.325
Dr. Bell, we have a problem.

06:48.349 --> 06:49.817
A former patient is suing Chastain.

06:52.186 --> 06:54.521
Hospitals get sued all the time.

06:54.531 --> 06:55.999
That's why we have lawyers.

06:56.023 --> 06:58.168
This is different. The patient has named

06:58.192 --> 07:00.087
Dr. Hawkins in the suit.

07:00.111 --> 07:02.113
And he just walked in our door.

07:06.317 --> 07:09.035
Rob Spiro was admitted one month ago

07:09.045 --> 07:11.431
after he was injured during
a failed robbery.

07:11.455 --> 07:12.850
And we saved his life.

07:12.874 --> 07:14.091
That's not what he says.

07:15.293 --> 07:16.436
I can't believe they let him out.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.856
Once the depositions are over,

07:18.880 --> 07:21.525
he goes back to prison to await trial.

07:21.549 --> 07:23.934
It's just for the day.

07:26.053 --> 07:28.365
Spiro claims that after his surgery,

07:28.389 --> 07:29.556
Hawkins withheld pain medication.

07:29.566 --> 07:33.153
He tortured Spiro to extract the location
of a man he abducted.

07:33.177 --> 07:34.763
And you believe that kind of criminal

07:34.772 --> 07:35.902
over our top resident?

07:35.926 --> 07:37.541
- A judge might.
- Judges...

07:37.565 --> 07:40.961
almost always side with the
doctors in malpractice suits.

07:40.985 --> 07:43.163
And that's if the patient
isn't a murderer.

07:43.187 --> 07:45.299
I can assure you, this suit

07:45.323 --> 07:46.740
is not gonna cost Chastain a dime.

07:46.749 --> 07:48.333
Any judge would throw it out in a second.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.026
We've worked too hard
to improve Chastain's image

07:51.050 --> 07:52.472
to let anything threaten it.

07:52.496 --> 07:56.393
Any association with Spiro
is bad for this hospital.

07:56.403 --> 07:58.228
You'll be in the deposition, naturally,

07:58.252 --> 07:59.836
and I'll be joining you today.

07:59.846 --> 08:02.639
Well, be my guest.

08:06.789 --> 08:10.096
Bell has no idea this gives us
the perfect way to get rid of Hawkins.

08:10.106 --> 08:12.182
Spiro's out for blood.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.810
And we're gonna give it to him.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:30.920 --> 08:32.389
Hawkins...

08:32.953 --> 08:34.831
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.289
Red Rock's lawyers will be here soon.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.352
You haven't always been on my side.

08:39.376 --> 08:40.754
I am this time.

08:42.044 --> 08:44.171
Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.

08:48.952 --> 08:50.870
- Where's Levin and Sutton?
- Levin is sick.

08:50.895 --> 08:52.387
Sutton was unavailable.

08:52.412 --> 08:53.737
We're familiar with the case.

08:53.762 --> 08:56.061
Shoot, I forgot my pen.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.573
Dr. Hawkins,
Mr. Spiro was in a lot of pain

09:07.583 --> 09:09.466
when he came out of surgery,
is that correct?

09:09.490 --> 09:11.773
Yes, that's normal for a major operation.

09:11.797 --> 09:13.852
According to his
electronic medical record,

09:13.876 --> 09:17.908
Mr. Spiro's morphine
was stopped at 8:32 p.m.

09:17.918 --> 09:19.749
Yeah, it's typical for morphine
to be withdrawn

09:19.759 --> 09:21.835
if it's depressing a patient's
respiratory drive.

09:21.844 --> 09:23.169
That's not the case here.

09:23.179 --> 09:24.764
You stopped the morphine to coerce

09:24.788 --> 09:26.673
a confession out of my client.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.686
Gonna perjure yourself, you little bitch?

09:32.355 --> 09:33.596
What did you tell them?

09:33.606 --> 09:35.826
I said Mr. Spiro was lying.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.234
That I provided him the standard of care.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.355
Is that true?

09:40.855 --> 09:42.232
The less I tell you the better.

09:44.775 --> 09:46.929
He confessed the location of a hostage.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.449
If you hadn't done what you did,

09:48.473 --> 09:50.757
another one of Rob's victims
would be dead.

09:50.781 --> 09:53.427
But if they find out,

09:53.451 --> 09:55.285
you'll never practice at Chastain again.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.336
Or anywhere else.

09:58.079 --> 09:59.922
Does anyone else know?

10:02.051 --> 10:04.261
Conrad, who else knows?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.163
Just Devon.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.120
Nadine, once the lidocaine takes effect,

10:11.121 --> 10:13.205
you shouldn't feel a thing. Okay?

10:18.184 --> 10:21.348
Amir. Give the man some space.

10:27.545 --> 10:29.189
How are we doing?

10:29.213 --> 10:30.941
Prepping the lumbar puncture.

10:30.965 --> 10:33.110
So, just a few more questions.

10:33.134 --> 10:35.558
There's a chance your symptoms may
be caused by an infectious disease.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.698
Any travel outside the U.S. recently?

10:37.722 --> 10:39.803
- A trip back to the Middle East?
- No travel.

10:39.827 --> 10:41.725
I haven't been back home since I was six.

10:41.734 --> 10:44.728
I spend most of my time in
a campus practice room anyway.

10:44.737 --> 10:46.741
- You're a college student?
- At Emory, yeah.

10:46.765 --> 10:48.228
I'm a music major.

10:48.238 --> 10:51.044
Mom and Dad insisted I go to college,

10:51.068 --> 10:54.664
even though what I really wanna do
is be a professional deejay.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.656
Sweet.

10:56.666 --> 10:59.359
- Do you make your own mixes?
- Yeah.

10:59.383 --> 11:01.889
I love taking old songs, classics,

11:01.913 --> 11:04.455
adding new beats, loops, hooks.

11:04.479 --> 11:05.976
Totally reinventing them.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.144
Making them my own.

11:07.168 --> 11:08.668
Okay, Nadine.

11:08.692 --> 11:09.980
All set. You ready?

11:10.528 --> 11:11.838
As I'll ever be.

11:11.848 --> 11:13.223
All right.

11:16.594 --> 11:18.989
Hmm. You see that?

11:19.013 --> 11:20.347
Your heart is enlarged.

11:20.356 --> 11:23.160
It's not pumping as vigorously
as we would expect.

11:23.184 --> 11:26.005
You have a condition
called dilated cardiomyopathy.

11:26.029 --> 11:27.938
It explains the shortness of breath.

11:27.947 --> 11:29.416
Most likely brought on by the chemo

11:29.440 --> 11:31.084
that treated your breast cancer.

11:31.381 --> 11:32.775
But my baby's okay?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.460
Yeah.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.053
But pregnancy is hard on the heart.

11:37.077 --> 11:38.842
The longer you're pregnant,
the greater the risk

11:38.866 --> 11:40.677
that you develop
congestive heart failure.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.179
There is another option.

11:42.646 --> 11:44.230
Induce an early delivery.

11:44.239 --> 11:47.733
My baby's only 28 weeks.
How early are we talking?

11:47.743 --> 11:50.236
Ideally, we would want to wait
as long as possible to induce.

11:50.245 --> 11:52.882
The sooner we do it,
the more risk to the baby.

11:53.196 --> 11:54.467
What kind of risk?

11:54.491 --> 11:57.220
Like underdeveloped
lungs with increased risk

11:57.244 --> 12:00.546
of respiratory distress
and some serious infections.

12:02.257 --> 12:06.228
So what's best for my baby could harm me,

12:06.238 --> 12:09.148
and what's best for me could...

12:09.172 --> 12:10.817
It's not an easy choice.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.403
The health of my baby comes first.

12:13.427 --> 12:15.385
I'm carrying her to term.

12:20.192 --> 12:21.614
We've got a problem.

12:21.623 --> 12:23.695
I'm not getting a signal
from the right L5 nerve root.

12:23.705 --> 12:25.832
Must be a screw abutting the nerve.

12:25.856 --> 12:27.063
Retractors?

12:29.357 --> 12:32.171
Whoever started putting in
this hardware blew out pedicles

12:32.195 --> 12:34.829
and left her
with a spinal pseudarthrosis.

12:34.853 --> 12:36.916
I see the screw,
right there, but it's deep.

12:38.199 --> 12:39.512
Poor woman should never

12:39.536 --> 12:42.025
have been operated on
at a spine surgery center.

12:42.035 --> 12:43.810
They thought she only had
a spinal fracture,

12:43.834 --> 12:45.869
but once they opened her up, they found

12:45.893 --> 12:47.854
spinopelvic disassociation.

12:48.459 --> 12:49.805
Got it.

12:49.829 --> 12:51.607
Those centers aren't
prepared for things to go wrong.

12:51.631 --> 12:53.549
And when they do, patients can be hours

12:53.559 --> 12:55.278
from a hospital and die as a result.

12:55.302 --> 12:57.447
She's one of the lucky ones.

12:57.471 --> 12:59.889
- Nerve signal is back.
- Okay.

12:59.898 --> 13:02.224
Great. We can start to repair

13:02.234 --> 13:04.894
and fix the spine to the pelvis.

13:04.903 --> 13:07.707
It was awful.

13:07.731 --> 13:10.960
My own doctor, trying to hurt me.

13:10.984 --> 13:12.977
I swear to God, I...

13:12.987 --> 13:15.236
I've never felt pain like that.

13:16.740 --> 13:19.824
Thank you, Mr. Spiro. That's all.

13:21.075 --> 13:22.805
Don't you have any more questions?

13:22.829 --> 13:24.079
We're good.

13:24.089 --> 13:26.591
All right. I'll begin deposing staff.

13:29.753 --> 13:31.587
What the hell was that?

13:31.597 --> 13:34.089
I thought it went well.

13:34.099 --> 13:36.008
Those Red Rock lawyers

13:36.018 --> 13:37.810
are barely a day out of law school.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.989
They didn't ask one substantive question.

13:40.013 --> 13:42.241
Conrad deserves an actual defense.

13:42.265 --> 13:43.622
I'm bringing in our old legal team,

13:43.632 --> 13:45.234
wherever the hell they are.

13:47.781 --> 13:49.457
No, you're not.

13:55.652 --> 13:57.483
You want Conrad to go down.

13:57.507 --> 13:59.698
Every year, whistle-blowers like Hawkins

13:59.708 --> 14:01.367
cost hospitals millions.

14:01.376 --> 14:04.870
He discovered that a drug
was killing patients.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.289
And good for him,
but what about next time?

14:07.299 --> 14:09.736
He won't hesitate
to take sides against us.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.720
He is our number one diagnostician.

14:11.744 --> 14:13.324
He's about to become chief resident.

14:13.348 --> 14:15.799
Long-term, I guarantee
a whistle-blower is a liability.

14:15.823 --> 14:17.693
Well, then, why not just fire him?

14:17.717 --> 14:19.552
Why go through all that?

14:19.561 --> 14:21.864
We both know his father's a powerful man.

14:21.888 --> 14:23.973
Former chairman of the board.

14:23.982 --> 14:25.368
I want Hawkins gone,

14:25.392 --> 14:27.559
but we can't get rid of him
without good cause.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.478
I want it done clean without any blowback

14:29.488 --> 14:30.623
from Marshall Winthrop.

14:30.647 --> 14:32.344
So you're using Spiro's lawsuit.

14:32.368 --> 14:33.690
A criminal.

14:35.994 --> 14:37.903
I won't support this.

14:37.913 --> 14:41.156
You clearly still don't understand

14:41.166 --> 14:42.741
how things work around here.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.503
You seem confused, so let me help.

14:44.527 --> 14:47.389
Red Rock gave me authority
to do whatever's necessary

14:47.413 --> 14:48.909
to protect Chastain's bottom line.

14:48.919 --> 14:50.875
So if Hawkins isn't gone
by end of business,

14:50.885 --> 14:54.003
then today will be your last as CEO.

14:54.544 --> 14:57.265
It's him or you.

15:01.591 --> 15:04.064
This is a new low even for Red Rock.

15:04.088 --> 15:06.530
- You think they'll really do it?
- Of course they'll fire me.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.865
Have you met these people?

15:07.875 --> 15:09.617
The only way I stay on as CEO

15:09.627 --> 15:11.786
is if I let them end Conrad's career.

15:11.795 --> 15:13.598
You can't let them get away with this.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.373
What am I... what am I supposed to do?

15:15.815 --> 15:17.602
Report Red Rock to the state board.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.529
- Take it to the press.
- Yeah, but then say what?

15:19.553 --> 15:22.380
I have no proof. I'd be out of my office

15:22.389 --> 15:23.858
before anybody even returned my calls,

15:23.882 --> 15:25.360
and then I'd be the whistle-blower,

15:25.384 --> 15:26.976
and then they'd move to destroy me, too.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.447
Then what now?

15:29.471 --> 15:32.390
I don't know.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.536
I-I make Red Rock think
I'm on their side.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.062
Show I'm being cooperative. I, uh...

15:38.072 --> 15:40.375
I don't know, best-case scenario
is I can figure out a way

15:40.399 --> 15:41.716
to save both of us.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.713
How's your pain level, Lynette?

15:45.737 --> 15:48.466
If I say zero, can I pack a bag to Vegas?

15:49.560 --> 15:51.038
Push, push, push.

15:51.048 --> 15:53.638
I have Nelly tickets
and a date with the penny slots.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.724
You just went through a grueling
spinal repair and fixation.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.499
I think you're stuck hanging with us

15:58.509 --> 16:00.141
for a few weeks. Squeeze my fingers.

16:00.165 --> 16:01.762
W-Weeks?

16:01.786 --> 16:04.672
The surgery center people
said I could be home by tonight.

16:04.682 --> 16:06.903
Well, they were wrong.

16:06.912 --> 16:10.511
And the surgeons who actually fixed you
want you to stay fixed.

16:10.521 --> 16:12.144
Somebody order an angel?

16:12.168 --> 16:13.825
Lynette, this is my dad, Kyle.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.493
- He's a volunteer here at Chastain.
- Yeah, we have

16:15.517 --> 16:17.161
angels like him to keep patients company

16:17.185 --> 16:20.104
- during their stay.
- Anything you need, I'm your man.

16:20.114 --> 16:21.506
How about a cigarette?

16:23.108 --> 16:24.669
No can do.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.763
Smoking constricts your blood vessels,

16:26.787 --> 16:28.946
which keeps your surgical wounds
from healing.

16:28.956 --> 16:31.115
And means you'd be here even longer.

16:31.641 --> 16:34.254
Well, buckle up, honey.

16:34.264 --> 16:35.763
If I don't get my nicotine,

16:35.787 --> 16:37.088
I'm more than a handful.

16:40.817 --> 16:43.627
Still going, huh?

16:44.445 --> 16:47.608
Yeah, they're...
about to depose the staff.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.944
That is where I'm gonna
build the tennis court,

16:49.968 --> 16:52.864
and this what I'm thinking of

16:52.888 --> 16:54.439
for the interior.

16:55.399 --> 16:56.807
Are you gonna stay in there?

16:57.269 --> 16:59.478
Yeah, I cleared my schedule.

17:00.618 --> 17:02.544
Thanks for having my back.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.964
How would you describe Dr. Hawkins?

17:09.988 --> 17:11.883
Caring.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.135
- Smart.
- Handsome.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.743
We heard he can be
a rule breaker. Is that true?

17:16.753 --> 17:18.890
- Never seen it.
- Define "rule breaker."

17:18.914 --> 17:21.809
Well, I saw him cut in line
in the cafeteria once.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.167
At any time, did you see Dr. Hawkins

17:24.178 --> 17:26.170
go into Mr. Spiro's room alone?

17:26.180 --> 17:27.765
- Nope.
- No.

17:27.789 --> 17:29.150
I was in the OR all day...

17:29.174 --> 17:31.509
where I should be right now.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.738
Mr. Spiro wasn't even one of my patients.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.521
Can I please go?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.519
We got nothing.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.415
Conrad is well-liked and respected.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.001
Nobody is liked by everyone,
especially doctors like Hawkins.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.692
What do you expect me to do?

17:48.702 --> 17:51.929
If I were you, I'd think of something.

17:58.712 --> 18:01.432
Hurry, please!

18:01.456 --> 18:04.383
Help her! Please, hurry! Hurry!

18:06.637 --> 18:09.713
Nadine, try to relax.

18:09.723 --> 18:12.049
We're gonna check your heart and lungs.

18:12.059 --> 18:13.884
BP 210/140. Sats in the 80s.

18:13.894 --> 18:15.102
Okay.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.965
Crackles two-thirds of the way up.

18:17.975 --> 18:19.867
Override a nitro spray bottle.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.892
Then call Radiology
for a portable X-ray stat.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.143
What's happening to her?

18:23.153 --> 18:25.122
She's got fluid in her lungs.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.208
It's making it hard for her to breathe.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.796
Give her 40 of furosemide IV.

18:31.820 --> 18:35.739
Okay. All right, Nadine. Open wide.

18:35.749 --> 18:37.418
Okay. This will help you breathe

18:37.442 --> 18:39.229
while we figure out
what's going on, okay?

18:48.420 --> 18:50.565
I don't get it. Her head CT was benign.

18:50.589 --> 18:52.506
CSF is clear. Cultures negative.

18:52.516 --> 18:54.485
No pulmonary or cardiac issues.

18:54.909 --> 18:56.487
Is it renal?

18:56.511 --> 18:58.012
Her creatinine was normal.

18:58.021 --> 18:59.907
Besides, that wouldn't explain
her syncope.

19:00.414 --> 19:02.600
So what are we missing?

19:03.588 --> 19:05.830
- I got to go.
- We're not done here.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.104
We still don't know what's wrong
with her.

19:07.114 --> 19:09.023
She could decompensate at any point.

19:09.257 --> 19:11.175
You will figure this out.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.661
Keep me updated.

19:15.007 --> 19:16.174
It's not my fault.

19:17.958 --> 19:20.845
- What?
- Rob Spiro.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.463
I tried to stop you.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.873
What does that have to do with anything?

19:26.274 --> 19:28.542
Because you're taking it out on me,

19:28.552 --> 19:30.595
and Nadine will suffer because of it.

19:33.557 --> 19:35.776
I have other patients,

19:36.117 --> 19:38.802
including ones in the ICU.

19:39.495 --> 19:41.555
And you were the one
who didn't want to work with me.

19:41.565 --> 19:43.307
Because you tortured a man.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.308
Rob Spiro is a murderer.

19:49.317 --> 19:51.158
And we're doctors.

19:51.182 --> 19:53.377
We're supposed to be the ones
who are helping people.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.880
- And I did.
- You break rules, ignore protocol.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.798
That is who you are, and it is wrong.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.823
We have been over and over this.

19:59.833 --> 20:02.386
A man is alive because of what I did.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.229
Oh, you didn't do it for him.
You did it for you.

20:04.238 --> 20:06.297
You're damn right I did.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.061
Had to make a choice I could live with.

20:15.354 --> 20:16.813
I got to go.

20:25.562 --> 20:28.268
So, we'll start you
on a cardiac regimen, oral diuretic

20:28.278 --> 20:29.853
and a beta-blocker.

20:29.863 --> 20:31.582
And then we'll see you every few days

20:31.606 --> 20:32.831
to monitor you and the baby.

20:32.855 --> 20:34.168
Sounds like a plan.

20:34.192 --> 20:36.677
And I have faith
that God's watching over us.

20:38.929 --> 20:40.257
Adaku, we want

20:40.281 --> 20:42.533
to make sure that you understand
what all this means.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.845
If the strain on your
heart becomes too great,

20:44.869 --> 20:46.787
we may need to perform
an emergency cesarean delivery.

20:46.797 --> 20:49.104
But even that might not be enough.

20:49.114 --> 20:52.132
I've seen women your age end up
with a device implanted

20:52.156 --> 20:54.021
to take over the function of their heart.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.273
Tethered to a battery pack.
Waiting for a transplant.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.858
But I feel fine now.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.801
Cardiac issues can escalate
quickly for pregnant women.

21:00.811 --> 21:02.995
Worsening heart failure...

21:03.480 --> 21:05.856
could kill both you and the baby.

21:12.406 --> 21:15.232
We're here to support whatever you choose

21:15.242 --> 21:17.331
if you are sure

21:17.355 --> 21:19.704
that you want to try
carrying this baby to term.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.835
Maybe I should take a minute.

21:29.904 --> 21:31.999
Add a thyroid panel, ABG and BMP.

21:32.009 --> 21:33.333
You ran those two hours ago.

21:33.343 --> 21:35.169
Two hours ago, she wasn't on oxygen.

21:35.178 --> 21:37.321
- Run it again.
- Yes, Doctor.

21:46.455 --> 21:47.681
You all right?

21:51.794 --> 21:54.271
I got to make sure you finish school
so you can start deejaying

21:54.281 --> 21:55.416
sold-out clubs around the world, right?

21:55.440 --> 21:57.534
I like the sound of that.

21:57.558 --> 21:58.919
And you can have a disguise,

21:58.943 --> 22:00.444
like that guy with the mouse mask.

22:00.454 --> 22:01.779
And hey, you already have a code name.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.805
Phoenix?

22:03.829 --> 22:05.699
Okay, you'll think of a better one.

22:05.709 --> 22:09.036
All I ask for in return are
backstage passes... for life.

22:12.982 --> 22:14.792
All right, I'm gonna go check
on those tests.

22:15.763 --> 22:18.189
Wait. Um... before you go,

22:18.213 --> 22:20.191
could you pass me the, um...

22:20.698 --> 22:23.360
the... the...

22:24.118 --> 22:27.054
the... the Ras?

22:27.064 --> 22:28.282
Juice?

22:28.306 --> 22:29.807
Yes. Sorry.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.118
I couldn't think of the word.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.037
Thank you.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.872
Has that happened before?

22:34.896 --> 22:36.540
Forgetting English words for things?

22:36.564 --> 22:38.899
A few times. It's weird, huh?

22:39.884 --> 22:41.401
How long has it been going on?

22:41.886 --> 22:43.737
A couple weeks.

22:44.180 --> 22:45.664
Why?

22:56.676 --> 22:59.419
Nadine forgets words in her
primary language, English,

22:59.429 --> 23:02.364
but her secondary language,
Urdu, remains intact.

23:02.388 --> 23:03.664
Could have a number of causes.

23:03.688 --> 23:05.935
But it happened when she sat up.

23:08.021 --> 23:09.513
So you think she's experiencing

23:09.523 --> 23:11.200
positional cerebral hypoperfusion?

23:11.224 --> 23:12.910
That's why I ordered an angiogram.

23:12.934 --> 23:15.913
Look. The blood vessels
in her brain have narrowed.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.298
She has Moyamoya.

23:17.323 --> 23:19.439
Which would explain
why she lost all sensation in her feet

23:19.449 --> 23:20.941
- while she was jogging.
- And why

23:20.951 --> 23:23.065
her symptoms only occurred
when she exerted herself.

23:23.074 --> 23:25.005
Moyamoya can be unremitting
and progressive.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.091
She could die of strokes
before she turns 30.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.874
Unless I perform a cerebral bypass.

23:32.129 --> 23:33.954
Time to get our princess to my OR.

23:34.688 --> 23:37.518
The first time my dad busted me,
I was 16.

23:38.108 --> 23:40.780
But instead of grounding me,
he bought me a pack.

23:40.804 --> 23:43.463
Said fathers and daughters
should smoke the same brand.

23:43.473 --> 23:45.966
- He gave you cigarettes?
- He'd smoke 'em with me.

23:45.976 --> 23:47.528
- Oh.
- Playing slapjack

23:47.552 --> 23:50.437
on the front porch
like a couple rowdy old drunks.

23:51.806 --> 23:53.640
Till he passed away a couple years ago.

23:54.458 --> 23:55.953
What did he die of?

23:56.210 --> 23:57.978
Heart attack.

23:58.546 --> 24:00.147
You know, more people die
of heart disease

24:00.157 --> 24:02.149
from smoking than cancer.

24:02.159 --> 24:04.628
- And still, you smoke?
- I know

24:04.652 --> 24:06.846
- it doesn't make any sense.
- No.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.341
The right thing to do is to quit, but...

24:11.437 --> 24:12.650
I can't.

24:15.563 --> 24:18.332
You know, that's the definition
of addiction.

24:18.983 --> 24:20.484
It's in my family, too.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.321
I, uh...

24:25.239 --> 24:27.174
I was a drinker and, you know,

24:27.184 --> 24:29.493
eh, drugs when I was younger.

24:30.994 --> 24:34.206
My daughters... they grew up seeing that,

24:35.165 --> 24:37.334
and one of 'em became an addict.

24:41.817 --> 24:43.699
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.504
Oh, God.

24:48.178 --> 24:49.529
Can you read that thing?

24:49.539 --> 24:51.258
No, but I-I...

24:51.682 --> 24:54.428
I-I... I think
I can find someone who can.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.337
Um, I'll be right... I'll be right back.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.122
Uh, excuse me? My...

25:00.792 --> 25:03.020
Hey, uh, can I just...?

25:04.879 --> 25:06.797
Hello. Hey, could you just help...?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.223
You got to be kidding me.

25:09.302 --> 25:11.362
Uh, hey, I-I need a doctor.

25:11.386 --> 25:14.063
Hey! Angels will not be ignored.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.557
It's my patient.

25:17.567 --> 25:19.212
- Y-Your patient?
- Yes, yes.

25:19.236 --> 25:20.644
Her mon-monitor thing... it-it's beeping.

25:20.654 --> 25:22.870
Could you... could you check on her?

25:22.880 --> 25:24.959
I think you might be getting
a little carried away

25:24.983 --> 25:27.878
- with your role here.
- Okay. I'm a Nevin.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.630
- All right?
- A who?

25:29.654 --> 25:32.072
Yeah, th-that's it! I want your name,

25:32.082 --> 25:35.417
Scott, and your badge number, right now!

25:38.672 --> 25:40.722
- I don't understand.
- I know.

25:40.746 --> 25:44.084
- It is a lot to process, but...
- No. I don't understand

25:44.094 --> 25:45.502
who comes up with these names.

25:45.512 --> 25:47.087
Mora-maya?

25:47.097 --> 25:49.996
- Moyamoya.
- Okay.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.495
It means "puff of smoke" in Japanese,

25:52.519 --> 25:54.822
because of the way
it looks on the angiogram.

25:54.846 --> 25:57.206
- Mm.
- Nadine, if we don't operate...

25:58.665 --> 26:00.383
...it is fatal.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.977
I've faced a lot of threats in my life.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.926
Kidnapping,

26:09.936 --> 26:12.721
poisoning, assassination.

26:13.290 --> 26:15.874
I'm not gonna let
a puff of smoke take me out.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.953
Then we'll prep you for surgery.

26:19.963 --> 26:21.288
I want my day in court.

26:21.298 --> 26:22.622
I'm sorry, Dr. Feldman.

26:22.632 --> 26:25.125
They've decided not to depose you.

26:25.135 --> 26:28.022
But Dr. Hawkins is one of the
best doctors at this hospital.

26:28.047 --> 26:29.239
He...

26:32.665 --> 26:34.717
A patient came in hypertensive last week.

26:34.742 --> 26:36.791
Hawkins realized it was pheochromocytoma.

26:36.816 --> 26:38.011
Who else makes that call?

26:38.064 --> 26:39.616
And not only is Conrad a great doctor,

26:39.640 --> 26:41.118
he make great doctors.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.392
Dr. Pravesh used to train under him.

26:42.402 --> 26:43.977
Total rising star.

26:43.987 --> 26:45.539
Oh, Pravesh isn't
Hawkins' intern anymore?

26:45.563 --> 26:47.156
No, he requested a new resident.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.369
Why?

26:55.222 --> 26:57.074
When did he put in the request?

26:58.350 --> 26:59.393
About a month ago.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.897
Wasn't that around the time they
were both treating Rob Spiro?

27:04.690 --> 27:06.249
Yeah.

27:07.445 --> 27:08.944
Why?

27:37.281 --> 27:40.784
They say a cerebral bypass
is like landing on the moon.

27:41.143 --> 27:43.097
Cain only gets one shot.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.715
Oh, I like that music.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.768
The patient requested it.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.376
Yeah? Who's the artist?

27:49.386 --> 27:50.377
Her.

27:57.394 --> 27:59.469
Show angiogram.

28:04.792 --> 28:07.713
This area lacks adequate perfusion.

28:07.737 --> 28:09.729
I'll need to reroute the circulation by

28:09.739 --> 28:12.658
performing the anastomosis right here.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.987
Show vitals.

28:19.833 --> 28:21.051
Pressure's stable.

28:21.557 --> 28:22.892
All looks good.

28:22.916 --> 28:24.638
It's exactly what I like to hear.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.663
Stopping the blood flow to the brain.

28:26.673 --> 28:29.341
Nurse. Pig clips and hemostat.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.034
Middle cerebral artery clamped.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.822
Dr. Chu, the clock, please.

28:41.846 --> 28:44.074
30 minutes starting now.

28:47.068 --> 28:48.351
Let's dance, Princess.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.023
You've been wasting our time,
and I'm fresh out of patience.

28:59.047 --> 29:02.282
I need a CEO who will
get things done at all costs.

29:02.292 --> 29:04.511
Clearly, that's not you.

29:05.185 --> 29:07.546
I think you should question Dr. Pravesh.

29:12.526 --> 29:14.438
We were all under the impression

29:14.462 --> 29:16.880
that he's one of Hawkins'
most loyal allies.

29:16.890 --> 29:18.782
Why talk to him now?

29:22.386 --> 29:25.105
Because I've recently discovered
that may not be the case.

29:26.566 --> 29:28.984
I think he knows what really
happened with Rob Spiro.

29:32.386 --> 29:34.354
Let's put him under oath.

29:44.975 --> 29:47.554
Occlusion time is approaching 30 minutes.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.013
Cain needs to finish soon
or risk permanent brain damage.

29:50.037 --> 29:52.082
He's throwing the last stitch.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.751
Let's hope this works.

29:54.761 --> 29:56.111
Prepare to unclamp.

29:59.684 --> 30:01.017
Dr. Pravesh?

30:01.851 --> 30:03.737
They've decided to depose you.

30:03.761 --> 30:05.155
Now.

30:08.099 --> 30:09.432
Pressure's rising.

30:09.456 --> 30:11.017
Elevate the head. Push the mannitol.

30:13.405 --> 30:15.355
Her brain is swelling too quickly.

30:15.365 --> 30:17.591
The edges of her skull
are lacerating her brain.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.258
We're losing neurological function.

30:24.282 --> 30:25.849
I'm enlarging the craniotomy.

30:32.314 --> 30:33.623
She's my patient.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.092
I'm not going anywhere.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.359
Taking down the anastomosis.

30:43.158 --> 30:45.195
Swelling is coming down.

30:45.219 --> 30:46.446
Time to redo the bypass.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.199
She doesn't have time
for him to redo an entire bypass.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.891
But we still need to restore
blood flow in her brain.

30:51.901 --> 30:54.630
And complete the surgery quickly.

30:54.654 --> 30:56.039
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

30:56.063 --> 30:57.457
Omental transposition.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.074
Yeah, well, you better
lose the suit, buddy.

31:00.493 --> 31:03.161
I save your patient, then we go.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.752
Step aside.

31:12.776 --> 31:15.128
Two Chastain OGs to the rescue.

31:15.138 --> 31:17.124
- No need. I've got this.
- Uh, sorry, brother, but

31:17.148 --> 31:19.861
the princess does not have time
for you to play hero today.

31:30.014 --> 31:31.074
Project abdomen.

31:36.613 --> 31:38.521
I see a vascular-rich piece

31:38.531 --> 31:41.043
of omentum we can use to place
on the brain. 10 blade.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.445
I'll need a piece
at least 20 by ten centimeters.

31:49.542 --> 31:50.934
Metz.

31:52.128 --> 31:54.896
Harvesting the omentum.

31:56.106 --> 31:57.768
Taking that piece of tissue

31:57.792 --> 32:00.446
from her abdomen and laying it
on her brain can stimulate

32:00.470 --> 32:02.962
the growth of new blood vessels,
restoring perfusion.

32:02.972 --> 32:05.025
Won't this increase the risk of hematoma?

32:05.049 --> 32:07.476
You're right, but we're out of options.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.140
Laying the omentum down.

32:24.485 --> 32:26.820
Show vascularization
over the next 90 days.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.885
Devon?

32:43.504 --> 32:46.316
Yes, yes, yes.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.151
Let there be blood.

33:09.447 --> 33:10.847
I'm sorry.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.225
It's not your fault.

33:14.518 --> 33:15.936
Got to see a patient.

33:22.097 --> 33:24.307
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

33:26.252 --> 33:27.636
Hold on.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.799
- What's going on?
- She's in A-fib.

33:29.809 --> 33:31.778
I'm getting her back into sinus
rhythm, and you're interrupting.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.386
Hey, hey, man,
I really don't like your tone.

33:33.396 --> 33:34.781
How about a little bedside manner?

33:34.805 --> 33:36.117
Lynette has been through enough.

33:36.141 --> 33:37.318
Dad, I appreciate the passion,

33:37.328 --> 33:38.618
- but take it down a notch.
- This...

33:38.642 --> 33:40.203
this is what I'm trying to say.

33:40.227 --> 33:42.979
She gets panic attacks,
so maybe we can all

33:42.989 --> 33:44.598
relax one damn minute.

33:45.006 --> 33:46.651
Panic attacks. What do they feel like?

33:46.660 --> 33:48.077
I don't know, it just feels like my heart

33:48.101 --> 33:49.745
is beating out of my chest.

33:50.178 --> 33:52.692
What if they aren't
panic attacks but A-fib as well?

33:52.716 --> 33:55.373
- Her past EKGs were all normal.
- An EKG could miss it.

33:55.382 --> 33:57.060
If she's been having
A-fib for some time...

33:57.085 --> 33:58.411
There could be a clot.

33:58.421 --> 34:00.330
Shocking her could dislodge it,
'cause a stroke.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.998
You want to do rate control.

34:02.008 --> 34:04.050
20 milligrams IV Diltiazem.

34:05.178 --> 34:06.386
Try it.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.402
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.261
Breathe. Come on, breathe.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.092
So, I hear Adaku decided

34:37.117 --> 34:38.762
to continue her pregnancy.

34:39.295 --> 34:41.514
Risk her own health for her baby.

34:42.022 --> 34:43.683
She and I are practically sisters,

34:43.706 --> 34:46.018
yet I have never understood her faith.

34:46.596 --> 34:47.610
Have you tried?

34:48.387 --> 34:50.357
You believe there's
some all-powerful being

34:50.366 --> 34:52.130
who can heal us if we just ask nicely?

34:52.141 --> 34:54.527
The fact is that faith
is good for patients.

34:55.034 --> 34:56.612
Those who believe they'll be okay

34:56.637 --> 34:59.366
- generally have better outcomes.
- That's no guarantee.

34:59.390 --> 35:02.692
Surgeons or God... everyone
needs someone to believe in.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.956
She has a long road ahead.

35:06.922 --> 35:08.898
Even if everything goes right.

35:09.257 --> 35:12.735
All the more reason you should
support her on her own terms.

35:12.745 --> 35:16.248
Even if she finds faith
in a place you don't understand.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.093
Lynette's stable.

35:37.103 --> 35:38.822
It was the right call.

35:42.126 --> 35:43.543
You all right?

35:44.775 --> 35:46.859
Devon's about to be deposed.

35:47.712 --> 35:48.832
I'm gonna go talk to him.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.417
And say what?

35:50.441 --> 35:52.594
That sometimes
telling the truth isn't enough.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.634
Sometimes you have
to fight fire with fire.

35:54.658 --> 35:56.840
Devon has to do what he feels is right

35:56.864 --> 35:59.092
no matter the consequences.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.177
That's what I tried to teach him.

36:01.201 --> 36:04.431
Now we have to respect his choice.

36:09.526 --> 36:11.771
Dr. Pravesh, let's cut to the chase.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.441
Did you see Dr. Hawkins go
into Mr. Spiro's room?

36:14.465 --> 36:15.558
I did.

36:15.582 --> 36:17.611
- Alone?
- That's correct.

36:18.118 --> 36:20.219
I understand you
recently asked to be assigned

36:20.229 --> 36:22.221
to a new resident. Why?

36:23.415 --> 36:25.224
Dr. Hawkins and I disagreed.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.120
About what?

36:28.128 --> 36:29.812
Too many things.

36:30.130 --> 36:32.632
Like the treatment of Mr. Spiro?

36:37.220 --> 36:38.465
Yes.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.457
Because Dr. Hawkins tortured him?

36:48.484 --> 36:50.244
Dr. Pravesh?

36:51.835 --> 36:53.563
Please.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.846
They need an answer.

36:58.658 --> 37:00.579
Do you have any reason to believe

37:00.603 --> 37:02.598
Dr. Hawkins withheld pain medication

37:02.608 --> 37:03.823
to elicit a confession?

37:03.847 --> 37:06.576
Dr. Pravesh, just tell them the truth.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.828
I know you're one of the good guys.

37:08.852 --> 37:11.104
Dr. Pravesh, just tell the truth.

37:11.113 --> 37:14.199
I know you're one... I know
you're one of the good guys.

37:21.123 --> 37:24.283
Mr. Spiro was in respiratory distress.

37:24.293 --> 37:26.703
Pain medication needed to be withheld.

37:26.712 --> 37:29.683
This man is alive today
because of Dr. Hawkins.

37:30.435 --> 37:32.102
Why are you lying, huh?

37:32.126 --> 37:34.177
Why are you lying!?

37:54.573 --> 37:56.626
Why did you lie for me?

37:57.217 --> 37:59.260
I didn't do it for you.

38:03.264 --> 38:05.394
These patients need you.

38:05.418 --> 38:08.061
And I had to make a decision
I could live with.

38:14.427 --> 38:16.845
Ah, you and I are very different.

38:17.930 --> 38:19.489
I respect that.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.258
Me, too.

38:23.493 --> 38:26.730
And I think this hospital
needs doctors like both of us.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.679
Your intracranial pressures
and post-op labs

38:40.703 --> 38:42.445
are trending in the right direction.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.113
Thank you.

38:44.123 --> 38:46.532
Dr. Pravesh, have you
ever saved a princess before?

38:47.575 --> 38:49.045
It was a team effort.

38:49.069 --> 38:50.953
The king will want to thank you.

38:50.963 --> 38:52.705
I expect he will be calling shortly.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.884
Well, what do I call him?

38:55.525 --> 38:57.543
Your Majesty.

39:02.198 --> 39:05.195
Okay,
maybe I lost my cool, just a little.

39:06.479 --> 39:08.294
Well, I'm glad you did.

39:08.318 --> 39:10.556
Now I understand
why they call you an angel.

39:10.566 --> 39:12.786
Nah.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.527
The truth is...

39:15.872 --> 39:17.146
...I love this job.

39:17.839 --> 39:19.459
Sometimes I feel like
it's the only thing I got

39:19.483 --> 39:21.150
to hang on to.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.486
- Mm.
- And I know what it's like

39:23.496 --> 39:25.497
when things don't go your way.

39:29.919 --> 39:31.294
- Damn!
- Yeah.

39:31.319 --> 39:32.972
How did you get that?

39:33.605 --> 39:35.225
I gave my kidney

39:35.607 --> 39:37.227
to my daughter.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.229
At least I tried.

39:39.253 --> 39:40.837
The younger one?

39:40.846 --> 39:43.139
Jessie. Yeah.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.986
She struggled with addiction.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.822
Opioids.

39:48.846 --> 39:50.330
She, uh...

39:51.831 --> 39:53.333
she didn't make it.

39:54.334 --> 39:56.519
Oh, I'm s... I'm so sorry.

39:56.544 --> 39:58.521
When we lost Jessie, I...

39:58.963 --> 40:00.523
I don't think I could've made it through

40:00.533 --> 40:01.866
if it hadn't been for Nic.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.256
She's the best thing about Chastain.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.843
You sound so proud of her.

40:09.867 --> 40:11.601
Yeah. Well...

40:15.303 --> 40:18.013
She's the best thing about me, too.

40:48.572 --> 40:49.914
I'm scared.

40:52.168 --> 40:54.210
Me, too.

41:20.628 --> 41:22.223
Dr. Hawkins survived the day.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.000
I can't say the same about you.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.169
- Hold it.
- Sorry, I got to make this quick.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.703
Oh, it will be.

41:33.292 --> 41:34.784
What is this?

41:34.793 --> 41:37.203
My resignation as CEO.

41:40.940 --> 41:43.541
Just finish packing and go.

41:43.551 --> 41:45.127
Oh, I won't be leaving Chastain.

41:45.137 --> 41:47.273
I'll be staying on as chief of surgery.

41:48.031 --> 41:49.538
Red Rock won't see it that way.

41:49.548 --> 41:51.643
Well, then you'll need to find
yourself some better lawyers,

41:51.667 --> 41:55.204
because my surgical contract
is bulletproof.

41:58.207 --> 42:00.036
You just try getting rid of me.

42:14.074 --> 42:15.741
Today Red Rock asked me

42:15.751 --> 42:18.972
to turn against one of my own doctors.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.777
And tomorrow they'd just ask me
to do something worse.

42:50.343 --> 42:52.512
There's a bloodbath coming.

42:53.289 --> 42:56.124
I don't even want to be up there
when it happens.

42:58.059 --> 43:00.202
But down here, I can survive.

43:00.561 --> 43:02.371
What's gonna happen to Conrad?

43:02.381 --> 43:05.758
Red Rock has eyes and ears everywhere.

43:10.328 --> 43:12.465
Conrad still has a target on his back.
