00:04.930 --> 00:06.200
Okay, before l start class,

00:06.330 --> 00:09.740
l wanna remind you all that your
grandmother is coming for a visit.

00:09.870 --> 00:12.430
And since she's your mother's mother
and not my mother,

00:12.570 --> 00:14.540
she doesn't know anything
about all of this.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.770
You mean,
how you won't turn on the a.c. in here?

00:18.350 --> 00:20.080
No. l'm talking about magic.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.180
And when Grandma's here,
no one uses magic or talks about magic.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.380
- Done.
- Got it.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.990
Now let's talk about magic.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.990
The spell for today, body switching.

00:31.130 --> 00:34.190
Awesome.
Alex, you and me switch seats.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.960
Max, that's not magic.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.460
Dad, she never lets me sit there.
lt would be kind of magical.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.390
Fine. Switch spots.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.900
Anything to stop this discussion.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.310
Okay, body switching is a spell

00:47.440 --> 00:49.840
where two people
can switch bodies with each other.

00:49.980 --> 00:53.070
For instance, Alex, you and Justin
could switch bodies.

00:53.210 --> 00:56.580
Why would l wanna do that?
l can already do more pull-ups than him.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.950
Yeah, well, l'd switch bodies
with Chuck Norris,

00:59.090 --> 01:01.680
do more pull-ups
and give you a roundhouse kick.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.849
You just admitted
l can do more pull-ups than you.

01:05.459 --> 01:06.550
Okay.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.790
Now, this is a tricky spell

01:07.930 --> 01:10.260
because if you don't switch back
before sundown,

01:10.400 --> 01:13.090
you'll be trapped
in the other person's body forever

01:13.230 --> 01:15.430
with no way out.

01:15.570 --> 01:18.970
And then you'll be a vampire
and you'll have to drink blood.

01:19.510 --> 01:22.410
You really have to start reading
the handouts.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.380
Alex, let's give it a try with me and you.

01:25.510 --> 01:28.810
Now just say the two people's names,
and then this:

01:32.820 --> 01:34.620
All right. Alex, Jerry:

01:41.760 --> 01:42.820
Excellent, Alex.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.090
You executed the spell perfectly.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.570
Maybe your mom's right.
l could drop a couple pounds.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.640
Why is it so hot in here?

01:52.770 --> 01:55.710
Man, you have a lot of hair.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.850
Smooth. Scratchy.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.510
Smooth. Scratchy.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.550
Alex, leave my face alone.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.810
You guys get the idea.
Now switch us back.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.450
Later.

02:07.590 --> 02:10.289
l've got a little shopping to do first.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.050
You don't have any money.

02:12.190 --> 02:13.680
No.

02:13.830 --> 02:15.060
But you do.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.990
Would you just--? l just put you-- Alex!

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.760 --> 03:17.820
Nice try, little girl.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.980
What? l changed us back
as soon as you caught me.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.690
l caught you at the register at the mall.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.190
- Harper, what are you doing?
- Planning your quinceañera.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.870
Oh, my gosh. Am l sick ?
What's a ''quincemono'' ?

03:34.010 --> 03:37.640
lt's a party
celebrating a girl's coming of age.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.800
That's why your grandmother's
coming to town.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.880
You get to wear a pink beautiful dress.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.680
And it's a Latin-American tradition

03:43.820 --> 03:45.580
that comes from the words quince,
meaning 15,

03:45.720 --> 03:49.880
and año meaning year, and ''era''
which just makes it sound Spanish.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.320
Yeah. l'm sorry.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.490
Everything after ''pink dress''
was just yuck, yuck, yuck.

03:54.630 --> 03:57.860
But there are rituals symbolizing
your becoming a woman

03:58.000 --> 03:59.690
that you go through with your dad.

03:59.830 --> 04:04.200
What? l didn't give anybody
permission to become a woman.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.530
l'm with Dad. You know me,

04:05.670 --> 04:07.900
l don't do anything
Dad doesn't want me to do.

04:10.880 --> 04:15.110
Well, look, l love being half-Mexican
and half whatever he is, but--

04:15.250 --> 04:16.310
ltalian.

04:16.450 --> 04:20.290
ltalian. l tell you that every time
you order pineapple on your pizza.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.190
The point is, look at all this stuff.
lt's all too girly and lame.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.450
No, thanks.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.860
You'll come around.
Because for the dress,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.760
l've embraced
traditional Mexican embroidery.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.200
The shawl will be overnighted
from Oaxaca, Mexico.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.240
What do you think?

04:37.370 --> 04:40.540
l think you sound like you're choking
when you say ''Oaxaca.''

04:41.910 --> 04:46.010
But maybe l could spill a little paint on it
and rip it and then l'll call it a dress.

04:46.150 --> 04:49.340
And when l'm done,
it'll go great with these.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.680
No, no, no.

04:50.820 --> 04:56.780
There's a ritual where you change
from a flat shoe to a high-heeled shoe.

04:56.930 --> 05:02.590
Well, maybe l can change from
these high tops to even higher high tops.

05:02.730 --> 05:03.920
No, Alex.

05:04.070 --> 05:07.090
There are certain things
that people do at a quinceañera,

05:07.240 --> 05:09.670
and we're going to do them.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.570
lf l can't wear my sneakers
and l have to wear that, then we're not.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.940
Alex, you can't cancel.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.700
A lot of work has gone into this.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.570
lt's my party. l can cancel if l want to.

05:18.710 --> 05:21.080
lt's not just your party. lt's our party.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.710
Oh, yeah? Well, it seems
like it's mostly just about you.

05:26.550 --> 05:32.220
lf l see so much as a scratch on that bike,
someone's gonna eat spokes.

05:32.830 --> 05:36.290
- Grandma.
- Lexie.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.730
Hey, and Harple.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.840
Here we go again. lt's Harper.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.240
- Hi, Grandma.
- Yeah, hi.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.770
How was your bicycle tour
around New England?

05:49.310 --> 05:50.900
lt was long.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.510
l was worried that the next time
l saw that bicycle seat

05:53.650 --> 05:55.740
was gonna be in one of my x-rays.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.510
Hey, where are Justin and Max?

05:59.650 --> 06:03.090
l learned a new wrestling move.
l wanna try it out on them.

06:04.090 --> 06:07.690
Jerry, that's the way
l left you a year ago: eating.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.730
Hi, Magdalena.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.260
And for your information,
l lost 5 pounds.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.830
Pull up your shirt. l think l found them.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.600
So how's the party planning
going, girls?

06:28.480 --> 06:30.880
They're very sensitive
when you make fun of my weight.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.190
l talked to your mom.

06:41.330 --> 06:44.130
She thinks your dad
could drop 5 pounds too.

06:46.430 --> 06:48.370
She's mostly upset about you.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.030
Yeah, she'll get over it.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.940
Well, l haven't seen her this upset
since she was 15

06:54.080 --> 06:56.010
and she asked
if she could have a quinceañera

06:56.140 --> 06:58.080
and we couldn't afford it.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.870
She wanted one
and she couldn't have one?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.010
Yeah.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.120
ls that why she wants me
to have one so bad?

07:07.690 --> 07:10.750
l don't know, mi hija. Maybe you're right.

07:10.890 --> 07:14.120
Maybe she figured at least
she'd get to have one for you.

07:14.930 --> 07:17.690
But it's just not me.
l really don't want one.

07:21.370 --> 07:25.170
But that doesn't mean
she can't have one.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.040
Don't be silly.
Your mother can't have a quinceañera.

07:28.180 --> 07:31.150
She'd have to be a 15-year-old girl.

07:32.450 --> 07:35.610
Stranger things have happened.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.310
No, seriously, they have.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.680
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

07:41.820 --> 07:43.810
Doing what she always does
when she's upset:

07:43.960 --> 07:46.790
Venting to customers
about what's wrong with her life.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.420
lt's not like l have another daughter

07:48.560 --> 07:50.590
l could give my hopes and dreams to,
you know?

07:50.730 --> 07:52.860
Anyway, corned beef?

07:54.240 --> 07:55.500
Hey, Mom, good news.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.600
l changed my mind.
l want a party after all.

07:57.740 --> 07:59.000
What? We're not ready.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.630
l thought we agreed. No womanhood.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.330
Oh, my gosh, you do?

08:03.480 --> 08:06.070
You really do? l'm so excited.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.110
lt's gonna be perfect.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.120
- As long as it's over by sundown.
- Why sundown?

08:12.320 --> 08:16.480
Because l hear that you can get
the banquet rooms for cheaper.

08:16.620 --> 08:18.850
Yeah, that's what l heard. Good.

08:18.990 --> 08:21.090
Oh, honey. l'm so excited.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.220
lt's gonna be great.
You're gonna look beautiful.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.230
You're gonna have a special dance
with each one of your brothers.

08:26.730 --> 08:28.000
Wait a minute.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.430
l heard ''dancing'' and ''brothers.''

08:30.570 --> 08:33.270
l signed you up for a couple
of ballroom dance lessons

08:33.409 --> 08:35.840
so you'll be ready
for Alex's quinceañera,

08:35.980 --> 08:38.539
So these two eggheads have to dance?

08:38.679 --> 08:40.580
Dad made a rule
against her being a woman.

08:42.250 --> 08:46.310
Well, l thought Dad made a rule
against her calling us eggheads.

08:46.450 --> 08:49.950
So l guess this womanhood train
is clearly leaving without me.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.420
Look, as a father,

08:53.560 --> 08:56.590
l am not gonna be left behind,
so l'm on board.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.200
No, l'm not.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.140
Okay, class.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.140
On to something
that all but two of you can do.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.680
The salsa.

09:16.820 --> 09:20.120
Oh, salsa.
Were we supposed to bring chips?

09:21.190 --> 09:24.090
And one, two, three.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.850
Five, six--

09:25.990 --> 09:28.120
This door should open out.

09:29.630 --> 09:32.190
Hi, boys.
l came to pick up my grandsons.

09:32.330 --> 09:33.820
But, Grandma, we're about to salsa.

09:33.970 --> 09:36.060
lt's not just a zesty dip.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.130
So these twinkle toes
are gonna teach you how to salsa?

09:40.270 --> 09:43.570
Oh, fine. l love a good comedy.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.870
Richard?

09:46.010 --> 09:48.680
And one, two, three.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.410
And add the three-step spin.

09:50.550 --> 09:53.040
Wait, wait, wait. You call that a salsa?

09:54.120 --> 09:56.680
lt looks more like you're trying
to get gum off your shoe.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.920
Maybe it'd be better if you all left.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.560
Fine.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.170
l'll teach my grandsons how to salsa.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.830
But, Grandma,
Mom expects us to learn how to dance.

10:10.970 --> 10:13.200
lf l can make salsa,
l can dance the salsa.

10:13.340 --> 10:17.440
You've heard the saying:
You dance what you eat.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.580
Grandma, it's ''you are what you eat.''

10:21.720 --> 10:22.980
Do you know how to dance?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.810
- No.
- Then shut up.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.180
One, two, three, wrestle.

10:38.230 --> 10:41.130
You look beautiful.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.630
Yeah. Pink and puffy.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.830
Really pink and puffy.

10:47.340 --> 10:51.000
But it's okay, because l'm not gonna be
the one wearing it. You are.

10:51.150 --> 10:56.050
- Alex, Theresa:
- Wait a minute. Are you doing magic?

11:02.990 --> 11:04.580
Why am l looking at myself?

11:04.730 --> 11:07.020
Well, you may be looking
at yourself on the outside,

11:07.160 --> 11:09.290
but it's me on the inside.

11:09.430 --> 11:11.190
Hi, Mom.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.200
You're in my body?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.730
Yup. And you're in my body.

11:17.470 --> 11:19.700
You are grounded as soon
as you get back in this body,

11:19.840 --> 11:22.930
because l am not grounding myself.

11:27.780 --> 11:29.840
Alexandra Marguerita Russo,
you promised your father

11:29.980 --> 11:32.280
you wouldn't do magic
while your grandmother's visiting.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.510
Mom, l know you're mad,
but just hear me out.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.820
This is the only way you can enjoy
the ''quincenomo'' you've always wanted.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.220
And then if you're mad, well,
then punish me. lt's okay, fine.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.390
lt's ''quinceañera.''

11:47.100 --> 11:48.260
Oh, my gosh.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.890
l love this dress. l'm so pink and fluffy.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.530
l'm 15 again.

11:53.670 --> 11:56.010
That's right, Mom. You're 15 again.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.110
Oh, l'm sorry.

11:58.550 --> 11:59.950
Don't be sorry.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.780
This is fantastic.
l'm having a quinceañera.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.010
You think we can pull this off?

12:05.650 --> 12:08.590
Trust me, it would not be the first time
l got away with magic.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.820
l mean, it would totally be the first time.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.360
- Alex?
- What?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.290
No. You don't mean ''what,''
l mean ''what.'' What?

12:19.370 --> 12:21.360
l talked to your mom
and she decided it was okay

12:21.500 --> 12:22.970
for you to wear
the shoes you wanted.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.630
Oh, my gosh.
When were you gonna tell me?

12:28.110 --> 12:30.740
l was gonna tell you
before the thing happened.

12:30.880 --> 12:34.010
- Before the thing that just happened?
- Yes, the big thing.

12:36.350 --> 12:37.910
What big thing?

12:38.790 --> 12:42.750
Nothing. l just decided
that l'm very okay with wearing high heels.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.290
And this tiara.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.760
l look like a princess.

12:53.170 --> 12:55.100
Don't you think you should teach us
how to dance?

12:55.240 --> 12:57.640
We've been telling Mom
that we've been going to lessons.

12:57.770 --> 13:00.300
Don't worry.
There's plenty of time for dance lessons.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.100
- When?
- The quinceañera is now.

13:07.550 --> 13:08.740
Time got away from me, eh?

13:09.250 --> 13:10.910
l need to get Alex a present.

13:11.050 --> 13:12.710
Max, you go find me some Scotch tape.

13:12.850 --> 13:15.220
And, Justin,
you go find me some wrapping paper.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.410
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.990
You know, that necklace
really doesn't go with your outfit.

13:19.130 --> 13:22.430
Oh, l know.
How about l buy it off of you?

13:23.060 --> 13:25.360
What are we gonna do now?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.690
You know,
l didn't want it to have to come to this,

13:27.840 --> 13:30.360
but there's only one way out.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.730
We have to break each other's legs.

13:33.340 --> 13:35.370
Okay. Me first.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.100
Got it.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.610
Attention, everyone.

13:40.750 --> 13:44.450
l present to you my daughter,
Alex Russo.

13:49.290 --> 13:52.730
Thank you so much, everyone,
for coming to my quinceañera.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.230
l just love saying ''my quinceañera.''

13:55.360 --> 13:57.260
Everyone, all together. My quinceañera.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.700
My quinceañera!

14:03.340 --> 14:04.860
Alex is really into this.

14:05.010 --> 14:08.200
Not to take all the credit,
but l always knew l could change her.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.310
What?
You know l just like to eat the icing.

14:13.450 --> 14:14.940
So does Alex.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.210
Now l know where she gets it from.

14:18.050 --> 14:19.540
Yeah.

14:19.690 --> 14:24.950
And now it's time
for the symbolic shoe ceremony.

14:27.360 --> 14:32.700
First, l will remove Alex's flat shoes,

14:32.830 --> 14:36.530
and then l will put on
these high heel shoes.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.100
Get your own, mister.

14:41.840 --> 14:46.250
What l meant is,
l will put these high heel shoes on Alex

14:46.380 --> 14:51.150
to symbolize a girl becoming a woman.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.250
Mom.

15:06.770 --> 15:09.430
Yes, son?

15:11.170 --> 15:14.040
We got kicked out of dance class.
We never learned how to dance.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.940
We're gonna look like complete fools.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.140
You eggheads.
You're gonna ruin this whole thing.

15:20.110 --> 15:21.910
Wait a minute. Eggheads.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.880
Eating the icing off the cupcake.
Your lip.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.680
And those high tops.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.290
The body-switching spell.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.390
You switched bodies with Mom,
didn't you, Alex?

15:30.890 --> 15:33.360
Keep it down, nimrod.

15:33.490 --> 15:35.020
Nimrod?

15:35.160 --> 15:36.720
Alex.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.060
That means Mom's out there.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.190
That means
we're gonna have to dance with her.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.100
And be good.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.040
Okay.

15:46.170 --> 15:49.440
Okay, how about l do the robot
and you pretend to oil me?

15:50.810 --> 15:52.400
No, you egghead.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.110
We can switch bodies with someone too.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.650
The dance instructors.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.080
Attention, everyone.

15:58.220 --> 16:01.620
Justin and Max
have prepared to dance with Alex.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.190
- Max, Candace.
- Justin, Richard.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.470
What am l doing here?

16:16.800 --> 16:17.900
l don't know.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.410
But like all the other trouble spots
l've gotten into in all my life,

16:21.540 --> 16:23.770
l'm gonna dance my way out.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.550
Do you know how to salsa?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.520
Yes, l do.

16:46.770 --> 16:50.530
lf you were 15 years older,
l would ask you to dinner, mi amor,

16:51.110 --> 16:52.570
Okay, that's really weird.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.630
lt's time for the big finale.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.900
Leap into my arms.

17:26.210 --> 17:30.200
- Really?
- l've got you, baby.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.840
Arms out. Hold it, girl.

17:40.990 --> 17:44.320
That's it. You're a swan.

17:45.790 --> 17:48.790
l'm a swan.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.850
We made it back by sundown.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.950
Did Alex and Mom switch back yet?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.990
l don't think so.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.230
Alex, the sun is going down.

18:26.770 --> 18:30.400
Sundown? l've gotta switch back
or l'll be stuck in Mom's body forever.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.600
Thanks, bro.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.330
Alex, Theresa:

18:33.470 --> 18:35.000
Theresa.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.940
Ma.

18:39.150 --> 18:42.810
You know, your father always wanted
to give a speech at your quinceañera.

18:42.950 --> 18:44.280
He even wrote one.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.490
And now that we are here
at your daughter's,

18:47.620 --> 18:49.180
l'm going to read it to you.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.190
''My dearest daughter, Theresa.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.560
When you were born at 6:02 p.m.,

18:57.700 --> 18:59.960
it was a rainy, rainy day.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.470
l knew
because l hadn't fixed the roof yet.''

19:02.600 --> 19:05.940
- So how many pages?
- l don't know. Like 30.

19:06.470 --> 19:08.910
You know,
he was always fixing that roof.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.310
Always, huh?

19:14.780 --> 19:15.940
l'm a klutz.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.720
Oh, well, that's all right, Maxamillions,
because you know what?

19:20.850 --> 19:22.340
l have it memorized.

19:24.020 --> 19:28.620
l just would hold the papers for, you know,
that sort of dramatic effect.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.060
Let's see, now where was l?
Where was l?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.390
Oh, yes, the roof. The roof, okay.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.230
And then when you started walking,

19:37.370 --> 19:40.900
l heard the pitter-patter
of both your feet and rain.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.130
l still hadn't fixed the roof.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.910
Hey, hey, Grandma.
You wanna wrestle now?

19:47.050 --> 19:48.380
No. ln a minute, okay, mi hijo?

19:48.520 --> 19:51.110
This is a very important,
emotional moment.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.690
Oh, so are you saying you're chicken?

19:53.820 --> 19:55.520
No. l'm just gonna start
from the very top.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.020
We're supposed to be crying here.
My dear--

20:00.460 --> 20:02.260
Oh, it's on.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.890
We'll pick this up later.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.030
That's not fair.

20:09.170 --> 20:10.500
Alex. Alex, the sun's going down.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.970
Hurry, say it. Say it.

20:12.110 --> 20:14.170
Alex, Theresa:

20:23.380 --> 20:25.040
These high heels are lame.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.350
Get them off me.

20:26.490 --> 20:27.850
She's back.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.490
Alex, l just wanna thank you,

20:31.630 --> 20:34.420
because the quinceañera
was everything l hoped for.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.050
You know, Grandma was reading me
this letter that Grandpa wrote for you.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.530
You should really hear it.

20:39.670 --> 20:42.660
Oh, the one about the leaky roof?
He read that for everything.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.860
Birthdays, weddings.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.630
He even read it when he won 10 bucks
off a lotto scratcher.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.040
Well, l'm glad you liked it
and l'm glad it's over.

20:50.180 --> 20:53.480
Well, it's not over yet, young lady.

20:53.610 --> 20:56.980
lt's time for the father-daughter dance.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.520
Oh, Alex, you really are growing up.

21:10.660 --> 21:14.160
You did all this for your mother,
and look how happy it made her.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.830
l'm glad we did this too, Dad.

21:18.970 --> 21:22.670
You really are turning
into a wonderful woman just like her.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.470
l am so proud of you, honey.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.210
Even when l break the rules
and use magic behind your back?

21:29.550 --> 21:30.680
Even then.

21:32.350 --> 21:34.510
Oh, honey, are you crying?

21:35.220 --> 21:37.490
Yeah, but why aren't you?
You've been crying for days.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.920
Well, l think l'm all cried out.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.190
Really?

21:41.330 --> 21:44.460
What if l told you
how much this quinceañera cost?

21:44.600 --> 21:46.000
Oh, my gosh.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.690
Here it comes again.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.040
Well, guys,
you managed to refrain using magic

21:56.180 --> 21:57.870
the whole time Grandma's been here.

21:58.010 --> 21:59.840
- You're welcome.
- lt wasn't easy.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.880
Took a lot of restraint.

22:02.450 --> 22:04.510
Well, you should really pat
yourselves on the back.

22:04.650 --> 22:09.020
Well, l've never been
in this room before.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.020
ls this room what l think it is?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.430
What room do you think it is?

22:19.500 --> 22:20.690
The wrestling room.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.160
Best two out of three.

22:23.670 --> 22:24.970
Gotcha.
