WEBVTT

01:17.994 --> 01:19.496
[both laughing]

01:25.835 --> 01:26.920
Huh?

01:27.003 --> 01:29.589
[suspenseful music playing]

01:33.760 --> 01:36.012
We're under attack! To battle stations!

01:57.158 --> 02:01.496
Ezor, find the leader.
Narti, Zethrid, take prisoners.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.123
Kill no one.

02:03.998 --> 02:04.999
[grunts]

02:33.069 --> 02:34.988
[indistinct whispering]

02:39.784 --> 02:41.035
Huh?

02:43.788 --> 02:45.999
-[screams]
-[grunts]

02:47.000 --> 02:47.959
[meows]

02:48.585 --> 02:50.169
[panting]

02:50.253 --> 02:51.087
[all grunt]

02:51.170 --> 02:53.006
[snarling]

02:55.174 --> 02:59.345
-[gasps]
-[grunting]

02:59.429 --> 03:01.097
-[snarling]
-[grunting]

03:01.180 --> 03:03.600
[grunts, groans]

03:13.860 --> 03:16.154
[groans]

03:17.655 --> 03:20.533
What's this? Some sort of communicator?

03:20.617 --> 03:23.411
You weren't trying to call for help,
were you?

03:23.494 --> 03:25.246
Prince Lotor would not like that.

03:25.330 --> 03:30.168
[grunting]

03:31.628 --> 03:34.714
[weapons whirring]

03:38.009 --> 03:39.010
[grunts]

03:39.093 --> 03:41.221
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.514
[sighs]

03:44.807 --> 03:49.145
-Who--? Who are you?
-You dare speak to Prince Lotor?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.523
Now, Auxia, that's no way
to treat our new ally.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.819
-Let him continue.
-We will not be enslaved again.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.989
-We are free.
-According to whom?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.575
Your savior, Voltron?

04:02.659 --> 04:05.745
And where is your precious protector now?

04:05.828 --> 04:09.916
Gone. Leaving you with nothing
but a hollow promise of freedom.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.336
And now you must answer
for what you've done.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.462
[gasps]

04:16.089 --> 04:20.301
Please, spare my people.
Show them mercy.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.429
Mercy has never been the way
of the Galra...

04:24.389 --> 04:25.598
until now.

04:26.099 --> 04:26.975
[gasps]

04:27.558 --> 04:31.562
How would you like to become
a valuable part of the new Empire?

04:31.646 --> 04:32.772
Join us...

04:32.855 --> 04:35.984
and you'll never need Voltron again.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.904
Smile! We're a team now.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.576
I wish Shiro were here to tell us how
to go on without him.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.453
Allura, when we came here,

04:47.537 --> 04:50.581
you told me I would fly the Green Lion,
and I thought there was no way.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.417
But then, I found it and I flew it.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.920
And then, Hunk flew the Yellow Lion,
and he's not even a pilot.

04:56.004 --> 05:00.091
In fact, you told everyone
who would pilot which lion.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.969
Yeah, how did you do that?
Did we ever find out how you did that?

05:03.052 --> 05:05.513
-Can you do that now?
-Sadly, no.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.181
When you arrived at the Castle,

05:07.265 --> 05:10.893
I immediately recognized
the special qualities in each of you.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.813
But I don't know how to search
the entire universe for a new paladin.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.942
Keith, you piloted the Black Lion
when you had to save Shiro.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.652
Perhaps you're the one.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.988
Keith would be the worst leader
of Voltron.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.742
Yeah, we all have our thing.
Keith's the loner. I'm the brain.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.745
Hunk's the nice one.
Allura's the decision maker.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.581
Coran's the wise old guy.
And Lance is the goofball.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.667
Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.
Totally right-- Wait a minute.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.504
I'm not a goofball!
I'm like the cool ninja sharpshooter.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.673
[scoffs]
Are you joking?

05:40.757 --> 05:45.845
I'm being completely serious when I say,
I do not want  you  to lead me anywhere.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.931
I don't want to be the leader!
That's just what Shiro wanted!

05:50.933 --> 05:54.896
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.398
Shiro wanted you
to be his successor, didn't he?

05:58.524 --> 06:00.568
Well, I never heard Shiro say that,

06:00.651 --> 06:04.363
and how convenient that you're
bringing it up now, when Shiro is gone.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.783
You want the job so badly,
you can have it.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.494
Now, now, hang on. I've called the head
from the very beginning.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.662
What about me?
I picked up on the radio waves

06:11.746 --> 06:13.456
that led us to Voltron in the first place.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.293
Hold your gazurgas, everyone!
It's not our decision to make.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.713
-We must allow the lion to decide.
-[Allura] Coran is right.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.674
We must all present ourselves
to the Black Lion

06:23.758 --> 06:26.052
to see who will bear this glorious burden.

06:26.135 --> 06:30.807
-What? You, Princess?
-My father created Voltron.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.518
How can I allow others
to risk their lives in battle

06:33.601 --> 06:35.686
and not be prepared to do so myself?

06:35.770 --> 06:37.021
I must try.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.655
-[Hunk] So, who goes first?
-[Pidge] Should we draw straws?

06:45.738 --> 06:49.575
I have it! I'm thinking of a number
between one and 50!

06:49.659 --> 06:52.620
Allura, you go first, Pidge is second,
and then the others.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.622
Wait, don't we get to guess the number?

06:54.705 --> 06:58.292
-But I already know the number.
-Allura, just go.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.513
[takes deep breath]

07:11.806 --> 07:12.932
Hmm...

07:17.687 --> 07:20.690
Mm... I wonder if I can adjust the seat.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.863
Nope. Not it.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.951
What are you doing? You didn't even try.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.078
Yes, I did. I sat down.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.292
I don't want to leave
the Yellow Lion, okay?

07:39.375 --> 07:43.087
I mean, it's big,
it's got this super armor, it's safe.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.214
But you called the head.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.967
Yeah, I know. I wanted to form the head
with the Yellow Lion.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.721
Fine.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.973
Pidge, go right! Lance, go left!

07:54.056 --> 07:56.100
Keith, make me a sandwich, stat!

07:56.184 --> 07:59.187
Yes, you heard me.
I'm the leader now, dang it!

07:59.270 --> 08:01.939
All right, you're not the one.
Out of the lion.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.404
All right! Now, I'll form the head.

08:09.989 --> 08:10.948
[grunts]

08:11.782 --> 08:16.537
[grunting]

08:16.621 --> 08:17.455
[groans]

08:18.498 --> 08:21.709
[sighs]
Okay, you can do it.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.419
This is your moment.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.094
[Pidge] So, how long are we gonna
let Lance sit in there?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.472
[Hunk] Yeah, it's been like half a varga.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.687
It's useless.
The Black Lion hates all of us.

08:42.522 --> 08:47.693
Keith, the Black Lion hasn't responded
to any of us. You have to try.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.529
[sighs]

09:01.123 --> 09:03.292
I know you wanted this for me, Shiro.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.840
But I'm not you.
I can't lead them like you.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.137
[gasps]

09:17.974 --> 09:19.767
Please, no.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.573
[roars]

09:53.884 --> 09:55.052
I'm proud of you, Keith.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.431
I wish you were getting the job
under better circumstances,

09:58.514 --> 09:59.849
but congratulations.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.310
-Congratulations, Keith.
-Yeah, man, ditto.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.855
No, I don't accept this.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.023
[all gasp]

10:08.232 --> 10:11.277
You must.
The Black Lion has chosen you.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.239
I can't replace Shiro!
You guys were right. I'm the loner.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.241
I'm not the leader Shiro thought I was.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.954
-[gasps]
-Keith, no one can replace Shiro.

10:22.038 --> 10:26.375
But the Black Lion wouldn't choose anybody
it didn't feel was worthy to lead Voltron.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.668
I respect its choice.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.754
And you should too.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.301
[Keith] But who's gonna fly the Red Lion?

10:50.941 --> 10:55.696
I want to carry on my father's fight,
but I need your help.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.700
Allow me to follow in his footsteps
as your paladin.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.627
Please, I must do this.

11:10.586 --> 11:14.131
Others are risking their lives
in this fight and I can't continue to--

11:14.215 --> 11:16.675
[crying]

11:31.816 --> 11:35.611
I'm sorry, Princess. I know how much
you wanted to pilot the Red Lion.

11:36.695 --> 11:41.826
I'm fine. Let's move on.
We must find a new paladin... again.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.457
[Ezor]  The poor little Blade of Marmora's
defenses are spread so thin,

11:48.541 --> 11:52.294
they cannot defend
any of the insurgent planets.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.296
And what about their rebellion?

11:55.506 --> 11:56.799
Crushed.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.136
As for the whereabouts
of the Voltron Lions,

12:00.219 --> 12:03.472
we've had reports of yellow and blue
in the Paglium quadrant.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.226
The red one has been seen
throughout these quadrants.

12:07.309 --> 12:10.396
And the green one here, here and here.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.942
No Black Lion?

12:15.025 --> 12:19.029
We've questioned the planet's inhabitants.
No one has seen it.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.615
It's like it just vanished. Poof!

12:22.908 --> 12:25.619
No Black Lion, no Voltron.

12:26.620 --> 12:31.167
Narti, go to planet Puig
and speak with their leader.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.793
[growling]

12:32.877 --> 12:36.380
A new paladin? I mean,
where would we even start looking?

12:36.464 --> 12:39.091
Well, I vote for getting
some alien diversity on the team,

12:39.175 --> 12:41.510
and I know some cool mermaids
who could be good at it.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.638
-You just want to see them again.
-Yeah, exactly.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.558
-How about those Blade guys?
-Or the Olkari.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.476
[static]

12:48.559 --> 12:51.854
Voltron, we need your help.
The Galrans have returned.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.482
Once you left, we were defenseless.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.985
My people are trying to hold out,
but the Galra are too powerful.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.528
The lions are on their way.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.991
Hold your ground and protect your people
until we arrive. Voltron stands with you.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.994
Thank you, Princess.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.958
[beeping]

13:16.378 --> 13:19.882
[beeping continues]

13:25.554 --> 13:26.555
[Allura] Keith.

13:27.556 --> 13:31.936
The Black Lion has chosen you.
You can do this.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.115
This one's for you, Shiro.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.173
All right, guys, we're not about
to let the Galra take back this planet,

14:01.257 --> 14:02.383
so follow me.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.552
-Where's Lance?
-What?

14:06.971 --> 14:08.222
[Keith]  Lance, where are you?

14:08.806 --> 14:12.142
[groans]
My lion's not responding to me.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.396
[Keith] Well, figure it out
and catch up with us as soon as you can.

14:28.409 --> 14:34.164
Attention, Paladins of Voltron.
This is Prince Lotor, son of Zarkon,

14:34.248 --> 14:37.585
Emperor Pro Tem of the Galra Empire.

14:37.668 --> 14:41.171
Surrender now,
or you will be destroyed.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.840
We've been set up!

14:45.467 --> 14:49.597
[Keith]  Evasive maneuvers!
Everyone, watch your back!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.932
Coran, we have to get there immediately.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.685
Lance, we need you.
The lions are being attacked.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.521
-[Lance]  I'm trying!
-I'm going to see what's keeping him.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.402
Come on, Old Blue.
It's me, Lancey Lance. Open up.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.072
Okay, enough goofing around. I mean it.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.158
We gotta get out there
and help the others.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.330
Oh, come on!
Why are you being mad at me?

15:14.413 --> 15:15.748
[groans]

15:15.831 --> 15:17.625
Wait, do you hate me now?

15:20.419 --> 15:24.089
I'm sorry for wanting to fly
the Black Lion. It was just a phase.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.678
Hey, Blue, you know what?
I gotta say, that's a great color on you.

15:32.806 --> 15:37.436
Oh! Are you from outer space?
Because your body is out of this world.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.104
[groans]

15:40.314 --> 15:43.067
Jeez, that's, like, my best line.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.869
Hey! It's the black kitty!

15:53.953 --> 15:58.666
So, it survived. Where are the others?

15:58.749 --> 16:02.795
Send out the rest of the fighters.
Let's see if we can draw them out.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.471
[screaming]

16:20.396 --> 16:21.730
Pidge, behind you!

16:26.151 --> 16:27.277
[growling]

16:27.736 --> 16:29.989
I hope your super armor holds up,
buddy boy.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.657
Where's Keith?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.744
[Keith] Guys, I'm having trouble here.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.164
These controls don't respond
like the Red Lion's. I need some help.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.043
[Hunk]
There's too many for the three of us.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.714
-[Pidge]  Look out!
-[Keith]  Lance, get out here now!

16:46.797 --> 16:51.260
-Lance, what's wrong?
-I don't know. Blue is shutting me out.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.138
Maybe Pidge was right.
I am just a goofball.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.932
Not only am I not meant
to be the leader, I guess...

16:57.016 --> 16:59.393
I guess now I'm not even meant
to be a paladin.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.894
[lion roaring]

17:02.896 --> 17:04.148
What was that?

17:05.065 --> 17:07.901
It's the Red Lion. You must go to it.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.030
No way. Keith probably trained it
to bite my head off.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.575
Maybe it's roaring for you.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.369
I would love nothing more
than for that to be true,

17:17.453 --> 17:19.955
but I know the Red Lion
is not meant for me.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.708
-It is choosing you.
-I don't understand.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.960
[Allura] My father built Voltron,

17:25.044 --> 17:28.422
but he knew Zarkon was a better leader
in battle,

17:28.505 --> 17:30.466
so he became Voltron's right hand.

17:30.549 --> 17:34.720
Lance, when you accepted Keith
as the new leader of Voltron,

17:34.803 --> 17:39.391
it proved that you value a strong team
over your own need for glory.

17:40.517 --> 17:41.685
Just like my father.

17:43.854 --> 17:44.980
I won't let him down.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.442
Go.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.455
Huh?

18:02.498 --> 18:03.791
[growling]

18:11.715 --> 18:15.302
[Ezor] There's still only three.
Where's the rest of the party?

18:15.385 --> 18:18.430
Let's turn up the heat
and see who comes to help.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.601
Zethrid, use the ion cannon
to shoot the Black Lion.

18:22.684 --> 18:23.894
Why the black one?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.939
There's something different
about that lion.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.650
Its pilot isn't in control.

18:30.484 --> 18:35.489
And, Zethrid, just graze it.
We don't want any permanent damage.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.157
Fine.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.557
-Keith, what should we do?
-We need to attack the ship.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.310
Can you be more specific?
We need an actual plan.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.314
[grunting]

19:10.315 --> 19:11.316
[Pidge] Keith!

19:12.568 --> 19:13.902
[ragged breathing]

19:13.986 --> 19:16.822
I'm okay,
but we can't fight this guy alone.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.035
You won't have to.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.714
Aha. Now, we're getting somewhere.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.675
-What was that?
-It's the Altean ship.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.927
[Coran] Need some help?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.268
Thanks, Coran.

19:48.061 --> 19:51.231
Zethrid, this is the moment
you've been waiting for.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.401
Fire on the Altean ship
with everything you have.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.777
Yes, sir!

19:55.861 --> 20:00.199
If there's anyone else in there,
this should bring them out.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.329
All right, let's see
if we can turn our attention on that ship.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.085
[grunts]

20:25.974 --> 20:29.061
Whoo-hoo! Boy, this lion can move!

20:29.144 --> 20:31.730
[cheering, grunting]

20:35.651 --> 20:39.404
-Hey! Be careful with Red.
-Oh, fly your own lion, Keith.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.073
[screams]

20:41.698 --> 20:44.952
-I meant to do that!
-[Pidge] Wow, we're really kind of a mess.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.080
We need to get organized.
Keith, what should we do?

20:48.163 --> 20:51.583
I don't know. We need to form Voltron,
but we're short a lion.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.043
-[Allura]  Not anymore.
-Huh?

20:56.838 --> 20:57.714
[roars]

20:59.466 --> 21:02.469
-[Pidge] Allura?
-[Hunk] Yes! Awesome!

21:03.387 --> 21:06.139
Ooh! Look, there are five kitties now.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.059
What are your orders, sir?
Should we fire on the lions?

21:10.143 --> 21:13.897
No, we've seen enough. Retreat.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.700
We did it!

21:24.783 --> 21:28.203
I mean, it was a little touch and go there
for a second, but, yeah, we made it.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.290
Allura, you and the Blue Lion?
How cool is that?

21:31.373 --> 21:34.793
Yes. It was a bit of a surprise,
but a happy one.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.879
Now, we know that Zarkon has a son.

21:37.963 --> 21:42.634
-This is... deeply disturbing.
-We need to find out more.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.437
Well, Old Blue, we sure had
some fun adventures, didn't we?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.730
I wanted to stay with you,

21:54.813 --> 21:57.691
but, sometimes, what we want
isn't necessarily what we get.

22:01.528 --> 22:05.032
-I'm gonna miss you, buddy.
-[door opening, closing]

22:08.744 --> 22:10.245
Pink, huh?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.748
Not what I was expecting, but I like it.

22:13.206 --> 22:17.294
Yes. On Altea, we wear this color
to honor our fallen warriors.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.297
I wear it to honor the paladins of old.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.132
And Shiro.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.302
This belongs to you now.

22:26.970 --> 22:30.807
If I had to lose Blue to someone,
I'm glad it was you.

22:32.726 --> 22:33.560
[Coran]  Princess!

22:33.643 --> 22:36.188
The Black Lion is leaving the Castle!

22:36.271 --> 22:39.983
-Keith, where are you going?
-I put a tracker on Lotor's ship.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.360
[beeping]

22:42.444 --> 22:44.988
[Keith] Tell everyone to get their lions.
We're going after 'em.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.659
You wanted me to lead Voltron?
This is how I lead.
