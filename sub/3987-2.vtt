Er, I...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.161
Well...

17:38.680 --> 17:41.570
If we had the original genome,
that would solve everything.

it's lost to us.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.205
Why the Duncans?

17:58.280 --> 18:01.489
LEDA started as a military experiment
under their guidance.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.811
Yeah, I got that.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.360
When the military shut down the Duncans,

18:06.440 --> 18:07.646

18:07.720 --> 18:09.563
They brought the LEDA genome with them.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.689
But they had sourced genetic donors
for two lines,

18:13.560 --> 18:15.562

18:16.880 --> 18:18.962
Professor Duncan
didn't mention male clones.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.485
No, he didn't.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.962
So who were these original donors?

18:23.040 --> 18:24.644
The Duncans took that to their graves.

hid their identities.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.003
he got this look in his eye

19:21.320 --> 19:26.565
and it was like he was
angry for the other one, Seth,

19:26.720 --> 19:29.564
like I had insulted them by
rejecting him.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.203
I thought he was gonna kill me.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.567
Then what happened?

19:34.760 --> 19:36.250
They went through my ID.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.324
They wrote down all my information
in this little notebook.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.122
And then Seth yanked out
a piece of my hair

19:42.200 --> 19:43.281
and put it in a bag.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.170

- Is that a trophy?
- It's assault.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.562

so that's not rape, right?

I've got more than I can count.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.523

I think you should know
how you got here, Helena.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.724
Your family sold you out.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.284
Sarah sold you out.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.483
They decided that you were expendable.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.450
I don't believe you.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.601
You can be sure of this...

25:50.680 --> 25:52.523
You're not expendable to me...

25:53.480 --> 25:55.482
Or my boys.

25:56.360 --> 26:02.322
You've overcome so much,
your upbringing, biology, your fate.

- Yeah.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.241
She's got three broken ribs, all right?

26:48.920 --> 26:50.524
And I think she might be concussed

26:50.600 --> 26:52.170
because she's being
weirdly straightforward.

- So go easy on her.

in touch with Paul.

I'm not taking advice from
somebody who sold my sister.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.323
That was my decision
and I'll live with it.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.525
But Kira shouldn't have to.

She has no idea what she's into here,
Cal, and neither do you.
