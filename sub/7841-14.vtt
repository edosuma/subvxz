00:28.573 --> 00:32.511
Come and get me,
you syrupy stack of man-cakes.

00:39.659 --> 00:41.259
It's too much work.

00:41.260 --> 00:43.590
Why don't you come
and get me?

00:51.072 --> 00:53.542
Jeez Louise,
are you okay?

00:53.543 --> 00:54.905
Just give me a minute.

00:54.984 --> 00:57.819
Uh, but feel free
to go nuts on me.

01:03.679 --> 01:05.471
Oh, boy, dinner time!

01:05.473 --> 01:08.670
The perfect break
between work and drunk.

01:10.317 --> 01:12.230
Wait.
What's that smell?

01:12.243 --> 01:14.369
It's like a stalk of broccoli

01:14.367 --> 01:16.839
fell in a pot of boiling water.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.255
It's your new diet!

01:20.259 --> 01:23.270
But I have all those old diets
I still haven't finished.

01:23.275 --> 01:26.831
Your lack of bedroom pizzazz
last night started me worrying,

01:26.836 --> 01:29.730
so I hired this nutritionist,
Betsy Bidwell.

01:29.735 --> 01:32.773
Homer, did you know I
used to weigh 400 pounds?

01:32.778 --> 01:35.102
I'll bet no man
would touch you.

01:35.108 --> 01:37.632
Well, I went from
fat to "all that"

01:37.637 --> 01:39.642
using my simple,
foolproof diet.

01:39.647 --> 01:41.932
It's all about little
substitutions.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.642
Instead of French toast
for breakfast,

01:43.647 --> 01:45.033
why not eat a bell pepper?

01:45.057 --> 01:46.542
When you crave something sugary,

01:46.556 --> 01:47.633
eat a bell pepper.

01:47.638 --> 01:48.463
Want a beer?

01:48.478 --> 01:49.390
Bell pepper!

01:52.316 --> 01:54.400
It's tangy like a pepper,

01:54.438 --> 01:55.953
but crunchy like a bell!

01:55.957 --> 01:57.003
Bell pepper!

01:57.116 --> 01:59.983
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs.

02:00.047 --> 02:01.101
One, please.

02:01.707 --> 02:05.543
Bell peppers... piping cold,
crunchy and bland.

02:05.548 --> 02:06.543
Three, please.

02:32.556 --> 02:34.481
Not quite.

02:34.798 --> 02:36.530
Yeah. Get out.

02:42.275 --> 02:44.691
You've gained seven pounds!

02:44.696 --> 02:47.251
Well, they say muscle
weighse than fat.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.612
Homer,
your body is all fat.

02:49.615 --> 02:52.581
Homie, have you been
cheating on your diet?!

02:52.585 --> 02:53.533
What?!

02:53.536 --> 02:56.790
I'm not even gonna dignify
that with eye contact.

03:07.258 --> 03:09.502
What you doin', Mom,
goin' crazy?

03:09.507 --> 03:11.081
Searching for evidence.

03:11.085 --> 03:12.972
I know your father's
cheating on his diet.

03:12.987 --> 03:15.220
Hey, Marge, looking
for something?

03:15.235 --> 03:16.791
I'm looking for something,
too...

03:16.796 --> 03:18.601
a bell pepper I don't like.

03:18.605 --> 03:21.080
Maybe it'll be this one.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.332
Wrong again.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.893
See that fat lady with
the moustache?

03:30.896 --> 03:31.510
That's you.

03:31.517 --> 03:33.241
See that hippo rolling in dung?

03:33.248 --> 03:34.250
You're the dung.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.841
Now, that's enough.
You each got one in.

03:36.848 --> 03:38.662
Oh, but hers was better!

03:40.406 --> 03:42.242
Meet Jennifer.

03:42.246 --> 03:44.842
She's worried her
acupuncturist boyfriend

03:44.856 --> 03:47.200
is sticking it to someone else.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.412
He used to be so loving.

03:49.427 --> 03:51.770
Now he says
he's always working late,

03:51.776 --> 03:54.451
but when he comes home,
his needles aren't even bloody!

03:54.458 --> 03:57.412
I've tried everything
except talking to him.

03:57.417 --> 03:59.281
Help me, TV show!

03:59.286 --> 04:01.541
We'll find out
if Jennifer's boyfriend

04:01.547 --> 04:04.550
has been fooling around
on Sneakers.

04:04.675 --> 04:07.063
If you suspect a loved one
of cheating on you,

04:07.068 --> 04:08.400
call the Sneakers hotline.

04:08.406 --> 04:09.953
Also call if you don't suspect.

04:09.956 --> 04:12.860
Most cheating happens when
you think everything is just great.

04:12.866 --> 04:16.802
Hmm. Could this show help
me with eating cheating?

04:16.807 --> 04:18.089
Out of the house, kids!

04:18.095 --> 04:20.152
I have to make an
adult phone call.

04:20.154 --> 04:21.783
- Oh, man,not again...
- How would you....? Come on.

04:21.788 --> 04:23.562
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:23.925 --> 04:27.630
Springfields national park
Now smaller than ever

04:27.897 --> 04:30.761
Hey, I didn't know
this park was here.

04:30.766 --> 04:32.822
You wrote a report
on it last week.

04:32.827 --> 04:33.920
The Internet wrote it.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.282
I just handed it in.

04:36.926 --> 04:38.801
Whoa, check that out!

04:38.805 --> 04:41.171
Cool! The strong kicking
the weak's butt.

04:41.175 --> 04:42.981
It's disgusting!

04:44.936 --> 04:46.960
Now you two play nice!

04:53.347 --> 04:55.132
This is my husband.

04:55.347 --> 04:58.201
I think he's been
sneakering on his diet.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.123
I didn't used to mind it

05:00.127 --> 05:02.930
when he'd lock the bathroom
door and snack off,

05:02.938 --> 05:04.801
but when he's getting it regular,

05:04.807 --> 05:07.730
night after night after night...

05:08.496 --> 05:10.061
There, there.

05:10.068 --> 05:12.142
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.

05:12.156 --> 05:15.242
No, I mean,
cry to the camera over there.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.470
There.

05:17.306 --> 05:18.993
Yeah!

05:21.356 --> 05:23.161
Hey, Martin,
what are you doing?

05:23.168 --> 05:25.261
Excavating for arrowheads!

05:25.266 --> 05:26.711
Dude, it's Saturday.

05:26.716 --> 05:28.952
- What kindof a freak wastes his...?
- May I join you?

05:28.968 --> 05:30.513
Care to make ita trio, Bart?

05:30.518 --> 05:32.532
You can brush,
and I can blow!

05:32.535 --> 05:34.500
Well, I agree you blow.

05:34.515 --> 05:35.831
Then it's a plan.

05:35.845 --> 05:38.570
A lot of people blow,
but no one blows like you.

05:38.577 --> 05:40.160
High praiseindeed!

05:40.165 --> 05:41.663
When you look up blow
in the dictionary...

05:41.666 --> 05:44.071
- Bart, he's not gonna get it!
- Fine.

05:53.845 --> 05:56.501
The bone's the very thing,
methinks,

05:56.508 --> 05:59.123
to prank my sister
and the dink.

06:03.428 --> 06:05.542
Martin, I've made
a major discovery!

06:09.247 --> 06:10.482
A bone?!

06:10.835 --> 06:13.080
It could be one
of the major homos!

06:13.086 --> 06:15.181
- You're one oft he major...
- Forget it.

06:28.128 --> 06:30.043
- Martin!
- Oh, my God!

06:32.378 --> 06:33.602
Grab on to this!

06:35.368 --> 06:37.203
Come on, wake up!

06:46.116 --> 06:46.831
Bart!

06:46.838 --> 06:49.032
You can't just run
away from this!

06:50.045 --> 06:51.251
You're right.

06:51.358 --> 06:52.840
I can bike away much faster,

06:52.847 --> 06:55.081
and ring the bell
to drown out bad thoughts!

06:57.087 --> 06:58.903
But Bart...

07:03.666 --> 07:07.001
Bart, Martin could be
seriously hurt, or worse.

07:07.005 --> 07:08.802
You're right.
We have to do something.

07:08.816 --> 07:09.882
Let's watch TV!

07:11.207 --> 07:14.653
<i>Happy, happy safe at home</i>

07:14.656 --> 07:16.192
<i>Happy, happy...</i>

07:16.195 --> 07:18.990
We interrupt
Kaptain Kiddy's Komfort Karnival

07:19.006 --> 07:21.900
to report on a grisly incident
involving a small child,

07:21.907 --> 07:24.422
who has apparently
plunged off a guardrail here

07:24.425 --> 07:25.971
at Springfield National Park.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.051
According to this pocket protector,

07:28.058 --> 07:30.802
the victim's name is
Martin Prince.

07:30.806 --> 07:34.071
Sadly, his pocket was protected,
but nothing else.

07:34.075 --> 07:36.771
And we know exactly
who is to blame.

07:37.318 --> 07:38.201
No one.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.123
The boy clearly fell by accident.

07:40.126 --> 07:40.911
Huh?

07:40.938 --> 07:43.430
He crashed through
the tree canopy there,

07:43.435 --> 07:46.252
and was presumably eaten
by this cougar,

07:46.255 --> 07:49.581
who is still coughing up
parts of the boy's clothes.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.470
Tragic, just tragic.

07:52.477 --> 07:54.440
You think this would fit
little Ralphy?

07:54.443 --> 07:55.739
Chief, that's evidence.

07:55.737 --> 07:57.549
I know,
but after it's evidence,

07:57.548 --> 07:59.045
it's a shirt again, isn't it?

07:59.049 --> 08:01.731
So Chief, what's your final word
on the Prince boy?

08:01.737 --> 08:03.463
Hmm? Oh, dead.
Definitely dead.

08:03.535 --> 08:05.752
Uh, Chief, aren't
we supposed to, uh,

08:05.756 --> 08:07.203
notify the mily first?

08:07.215 --> 08:08.942
What do you think
I'm doing right now?

08:09.287 --> 08:12.810
<i>Happy, happy, safe at home.</i>

08:12.817 --> 08:14.860
- Oh, my God!
- We're murderers!

08:14.865 --> 08:16.802
Hey, I was trying to help him.

08:16.808 --> 08:18.913
At worst, I'm an accomplice.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.521
I'm an accomplice!

08:29.735 --> 08:31.102
Bookmobile.

08:31.107 --> 08:33.062
Got any Joyce Carol Oates?

08:33.115 --> 08:35.173
Nope.
It's allDanielle Steel.

08:35.908 --> 08:39.582
I've been in trouble,
but never like this.

08:39.626 --> 08:41.971
Guess I'll go turn myself in.

08:46.668 --> 08:48.440
Uh, let's think about this.

08:48.448 --> 08:51.153
Martin's gone,
but it was an accident.

08:51.157 --> 08:53.580
Ruining our lives
won't bring him back.

08:53.586 --> 08:54.530
Lisa!

08:54.535 --> 08:56.531
You're saying
we shouldn't tell the truth?!

08:56.536 --> 08:59.513
I'm saying this is worse than
a million A minuses!

08:59.515 --> 09:01.371
So, how was your outside time?

09:01.378 --> 09:03.153
We were never outside.
We were here all day.

09:03.157 --> 09:06.001
That quick talking
is never a good sign.

09:06.008 --> 09:07.992
That's usually true,
but in this case, it's not.

09:08.145 --> 09:11.521
Hmm. The kids are
acting awfully strange.

09:11.528 --> 09:14.183
Maybe I should sit down
with them and...

09:14.187 --> 09:16.223
- Homer, where are you going?!
- Work.

09:16.225 --> 09:18.762
It's 4:00 o'clock
on a Saturday.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.183
I, uh,...

09:20.185 --> 09:23.113
have to count the atoms
at the nuclear plant.

09:23.117 --> 09:25.452
Conservation of mass.
It's the law.

09:30.066 --> 09:33.112
The load is on the road.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.663
This episode's gonna be great.

09:38.668 --> 09:41.352
It'll finally win me
the respect of my father,

09:41.358 --> 09:43.722
the Reverend Billy Graham, Junior.

09:58.537 --> 10:00.430
Martin Prince was known

10:00.438 --> 10:01.750
by many names...

10:01.755 --> 10:04.982
Martin Priss, Martin Princess,
Fartin' Prince,

10:04.985 --> 10:06.893
Martin the Brown-Nosed Reindeer...

10:06.897 --> 10:07.960
That was mine.

10:07.968 --> 10:10.041
Martin was a shy, awkward child

10:10.048 --> 10:12.823
who will never fulfill his
promise to become

10:12.826 --> 10:14.610
a weird, unloved adult.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.682
The Audio-Visual Club
has prepared a video tribute

10:17.687 --> 10:19.480
to their fallen associate.

10:29.137 --> 10:34.200
<i>I will remember you</i>

10:35.776 --> 10:41.101
<i>Will you remember me?</i>

10:41.598 --> 10:46.381
<i>Don't let your life pass you by</i>

10:46.385 --> 10:48.850
Jimbo, stop that.

10:48.857 --> 10:49.930
Usually when I do

10:49.936 --> 10:51.661
something bad, I feel good.

10:51.665 --> 10:52.972
But not this time.

10:52.978 --> 10:56.190
Martin was like Jesus, only real.

10:56.437 --> 11:00.093
Bart, keep it together.
People are looking.

11:00.098 --> 11:01.572
I'm filled with rue.

11:01.575 --> 11:04.020
You know,
something bugs me.

11:04.028 --> 11:06.222
Martin was afraid of heights.

11:06.225 --> 11:07.862
What's he doing on a cliff?

11:07.885 --> 11:09.053
It don't add up.

11:09.056 --> 11:11.410
Hey, look who's trying to add.

11:11.417 --> 11:12.902
You wuss.

11:23.937 --> 11:26.212
The pig is in the sty.

11:27.185 --> 11:29.980
You know, I used to make
documentaries about

11:29.988 --> 11:33.022
coal miners, migrant workers,
things that mattered.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.520
Yeah yeah, we're all whores.
Just get in there.

11:48.316 --> 11:52.163
Into your hands,
I commend this crap.

12:04.428 --> 12:06.742
Well, enough burning ants.

12:06.745 --> 12:08.530
Time to investigate.

12:24.876 --> 12:28.152
I now declare you
chips and salsa.

12:33.275 --> 12:34.672
Oh, hey, kids.

12:35.105 --> 12:36.900
Um... what's up?

12:36.905 --> 12:37.913
What do you mean "what's up"?

12:37.918 --> 12:39.053
Why would something be up?

12:39.055 --> 12:40.552
Yeah, nothing's up,
nothing's down,

12:40.555 --> 12:42.241
except for Martin, who died.

12:42.247 --> 12:44.031
- Idiot!
- D'oh!

12:46.116 --> 12:48.851
Well, I certainly wasn't eating

12:48.857 --> 12:51.150
chips and salsa
from this briefcase.

12:51.158 --> 12:53.411
- What's up?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

13:25.808 --> 13:29.043
Mmm, lamb.

13:49.626 --> 13:53.642
Uh, I've never said this before,
but turn the camera off.

13:57.616 --> 14:00.752
- Hey, you little murderer.
- What?!

14:00.758 --> 14:02.461
Those shades are killing me,

14:02.467 --> 14:03.431
they're so cute.

14:06.977 --> 14:08.572
Act like you're shopping.

14:08.588 --> 14:10.250
We can't be seen together.

14:10.257 --> 14:12.942
- But we're brother and sister.
- Exactly.

14:12.948 --> 14:14.550
- Give me an lndian burn.
- But...

14:14.555 --> 14:16.521
Don't make me say
"Indian" again.

14:18.345 --> 14:19.733
Afternoon.

14:20.248 --> 14:21.962
Doing a little shopping, huh?

14:22.127 --> 14:24.693
Shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart.

14:24.707 --> 14:26.933
I like how "Kwik" is spelled
with a "K."

14:26.936 --> 14:28.790
It's a quicker way
of spelling "quick. "

14:28.906 --> 14:30.723
Well, you're busy people.

14:30.728 --> 14:32.570
I'll let you get on
with your day.

14:32.646 --> 14:35.840
Oh, there is
one other thing.

14:35.848 --> 14:38.313
I was up in
Springfield National Park.

14:38.317 --> 14:40.560
You know,
where Martin bit the big one?

14:40.568 --> 14:43.370
Found this bone tied
to a string.

14:43.377 --> 14:47.013
Almost like someone
was playing a prank on him.

14:47.017 --> 14:49.192
You like pranks,
don't you, dingus?

14:49.195 --> 14:50.421
I... like pranks.

14:50.425 --> 14:52.913
Everyone likes pranks,
e- even Dr. Hibbert.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.132
I hate pranks.

14:54.137 --> 14:55.963
Well, better get going.

14:55.966 --> 14:57.972
The missus is cooking
meat loaf tonight.

14:57.975 --> 14:59.860
My mom... Mrs. Muntz.

15:04.296 --> 15:06.140
Bart, I have a plan.

15:06.195 --> 15:08.412
We go to the morgue and
come back with a hand,

15:08.425 --> 15:10.963
put its fingerprints
all over the railing...

15:11.768 --> 15:13.690
Why are you being
so quiet, Bart?

15:13.767 --> 15:15.250
Are you judging me?

15:15.265 --> 15:17.123
Please don't judge me.

15:18.496 --> 15:20.861
"I can't live with the guilt.

15:20.865 --> 15:22.883
I'm going to Martin's house

15:22.888 --> 15:24.782
to end it all"?!

15:28.296 --> 15:30.032
Come on, pick up, pick up,

15:30.037 --> 15:31.360
I know you're there.

15:33.638 --> 15:36.242
Listen, baby,
the other night was great,

15:36.256 --> 15:38.003
but it can never happen again.

15:38.075 --> 15:39.042
Oh, who am I kidding?

15:39.047 --> 15:40.321
I have to see you right now.

15:52.008 --> 15:54.202
Bart, no, don't do...

15:54.207 --> 15:56.753
whatever the heck
you're doing.

15:56.758 --> 15:59.101
I'm tending to Martin's
butterfly enclosure.

15:59.106 --> 16:01.721
His butterflies are emerging
from their chrysalises tonight.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.903
You said you wanted
to end it all.

16:03.917 --> 16:05.603
By which I meant bring Martin's

16:05.615 --> 16:07.363
butterfly project to completion.

16:07.365 --> 16:08.570
I can't take it anymore.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.832
The stress is killing me.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.040
I'm on a freight train
to Crazy Town.

16:12.047 --> 16:14.293
- Çalm down.
- You calm down!

16:15.476 --> 16:16.843
What was that?

16:20.508 --> 16:23.012
The butterflies are hatching.

16:23.676 --> 16:25.633
Aren't they beautiful?

16:25.637 --> 16:28.223
<i>Greetings, my friends.</i>

16:28.698 --> 16:31.060
<i>This beguiling lute solo</i>

16:31.066 --> 16:34.351
<i>will ease your metamorphoses.</i>

16:36.628 --> 16:38.532
Oh, it's a tape.

16:38.655 --> 16:40.450
Martin must have set it to go off

16:40.455 --> 16:42.042
when the chrysalises hatched.

16:42.046 --> 16:45.140
Now, if I may mimic
your mother's feeding call...

16:45.145 --> 16:46.961
Clawdy-claw,

16:46.975 --> 16:49.660
clickety-cloo, clawdy-claw...

16:49.667 --> 16:50.800
Thank you.

16:52.835 --> 16:55.682
I thought I turned
that tape off.

16:55.685 --> 16:58.502
Maybe you just put
it on auto-reverse.

16:58.576 --> 17:01.621
"Congratulations on purchasing
the Sanyo DL30,

17:01.626 --> 17:04.342
the finest non-reversing
tape player"...

17:11.246 --> 17:14.452
Here you go, hon-
one Butterscotch Stallion.

17:14.454 --> 17:16.839
Homer Jay Simpson!

17:16.847 --> 17:18.580
Pudding power, activate!

17:18.866 --> 17:20.430
Oh, no, you don't.

17:20.734 --> 17:22.349
Let him have it, Marge.

17:22.355 --> 17:24.430
Sweetheart, I didn't want
to deceive you.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.103
I just couldn't stand to see

17:26.108 --> 17:28.410
the disappointment
in your beautiful eyes.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.280
That's it, Marge.
Slap him good.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.593
Zack, you're not trying
to help our marriage.

17:37.597 --> 17:39.811
You're trying to split us up.

17:39.818 --> 17:43.612
I'd rather have a chubby
hubby than a sexy exy.

17:43.616 --> 17:46.311
Aw, Marge, if there was
a reality show

17:46.318 --> 17:49.071
called Fat Guys Who Really
Love Their Wives,

17:49.076 --> 17:52.132
that not only would it be an
enormous ratings success,

17:52.138 --> 17:54.370
but I'd be the first one on it.

17:56.657 --> 17:58.152
Marge, you've given me a lot

17:58.157 --> 17:59.271
to think about today.

17:59.277 --> 18:00.702
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:00.715 --> 18:02.083
I'm going to the editing room

18:02.086 --> 18:03.212
to make you look insane.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.803
To the post-production trailer!

18:13.068 --> 18:15.752
Where is this music coming from?

18:23.017 --> 18:25.371
Get off me!

18:28.906 --> 18:31.882
His foot is caught
in my button hole.

18:31.886 --> 18:34.433
I almost flicked
an innocent butterfly.

18:34.438 --> 18:37.523
Bart, we're turning
into monsters.

18:37.527 --> 18:39.920
- Cool.
- No, not cool.

18:39.927 --> 18:42.902
We have to do the right thing
and come clean.

18:42.906 --> 18:47.012
Listen, world,
we killed Martin Prince!

18:47.015 --> 18:49.802
That's all I needed to hear.

18:49.808 --> 18:51.262
You almost got away with it,

18:51.266 --> 18:52.922
but here's where you got sloppy:

18:52.926 --> 18:54.910
shouting out that you did it.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.713
Oh, man, I'm too pretty
to go to jail.

18:57.716 --> 18:59.840
You don't know
how lucky you are.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.042
I'm just glad it was you

19:03.046 --> 19:04.800
who brought us in, Nelson.

19:04.805 --> 19:06.713
Remember when
we used to date?

19:06.727 --> 19:07.723
If you let me go,

19:07.725 --> 19:09.190
we can get back together.

19:09.206 --> 19:10.900
I never let you cherry-bomb

19:10.907 --> 19:11.913
my Malibu Stacy.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.231
I'll let you do it now.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.560
Save it for the warden.

19:14.566 --> 19:16.160
Please, keep it down

19:16.168 --> 19:17.761
around the newborns.

19:18.417 --> 19:21.332
To quote Mark Twain,
"rumors of my death

19:21.335 --> 19:23.620
have been greatly exaggerated. "

19:23.628 --> 19:25.642
Yeah, and rumors
of your wussiness

19:25.648 --> 19:27.170
are a hundred percent true.

19:27.175 --> 19:28.843
Now tell us how
you survived the fall.

19:28.848 --> 19:30.553
For years I've worn underwear

19:30.557 --> 19:32.832
with a wedgie-accommodating
waistband.

19:32.877 --> 19:34.751
On that fateful day,

19:34.757 --> 19:38.213
these mighty whiteys
saved my life.

19:42.338 --> 19:44.643
<i>Malheureusement, I landed</i>

19:44.646 --> 19:47.122
<i>right next to a cougar's lair.</i>

19:47.127 --> 19:48.992
<i>He saw me as easy prey.</i>

19:50.096 --> 19:52.281
<i>I feared death was a certainty</i>

19:52.286 --> 19:53.860
<i>until I was saved</i>

19:53.866 --> 19:55.293
<i>by simple physics.</i>

19:58.926 --> 20:00.410
<i>I landed on a small isle</i>

20:00.416 --> 20:02.072
<i>in the middle of a murky lake.</i>

20:02.075 --> 20:04.712
<i>I spent an hour fashioning
an escape raft</i>

20:04.716 --> 20:06.871
<i>and three days crafting</i>

20:06.875 --> 20:08.442
<i>this modesty skirt.</i>

20:11.767 --> 20:13.182
Well, it's good to have

20:13.185 --> 20:14.542
you alive, Dorkburger,

20:14.556 --> 20:15.901
and as for you two,

20:15.908 --> 20:17.150
I hope you learned your lesson.

20:17.157 --> 20:19.611
I learned that beneath
my goody two-shoes

20:19.616 --> 20:22.310
lie some very dark socks.

20:22.317 --> 20:24.512
And I learned that killing a nerd

20:24.516 --> 20:26.310
is not as fun as it sounds.

20:27.697 --> 20:31.141
There is just one more thing.

20:31.145 --> 20:33.290
You folks have
a good night now.
