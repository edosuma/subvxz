01:47.120 --> 01:48.520
Jesse?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.033
Jesse!

01:55.120 --> 01:57.351
Show yourself right now!

04:31.200 --> 04:32.953
I'll be in touch.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.476
Okay. Hey, Huell.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.720
Listen, I want you to swing by the
high school on your way to Saul's.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.920
I can't believe he would
go after my son, but...

04:43.240 --> 04:45.994
You got it.
And Kuby's at the car wash, right?

04:46.200 --> 04:49.318
Parked right across the street.
All's quiet. No Pinkman.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.392
Okay. Just find him.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.639
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

05:11.840 --> 05:14.992
Jesse, listen.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.274
I mean, obviously,
you've changed your mind here,

05:18.440 --> 05:21.274
and so thank you for that.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.909
And I know you're angry.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.390
I wanna fix this, okay?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.156
Whatever it takes, all right?

05:29.320 --> 05:32.074
We'll talk, and we will fix this.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.393
Until then, just...

05:36.640 --> 05:39.235
Just sleep it off, okay?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.909
And then call me.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.639
Be safe.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.710
How's it coming?

05:47.880 --> 05:49.951
I replaced the doorjamb
and the striker plate.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.277
Switch this out, we'll be good to go.
Good.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.830
Do you want separate keys
for the different locks

05:55.040 --> 05:58.795
or do you want one working both?
No, no, no. No re-key.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.231
Same exact keys as before.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.869
Usually with a break-in,
people like to get new keys.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.997
No, same keys, same locks.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.117
The old keys
have to work here, okay?

06:08.280 --> 06:09.999
Okay.
All right.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.914
Good.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.440
Good. Good, good, good.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.830
Oh, no, no.
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.590
Cut that. Yeah, this...
That area's still pretty bad.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.031
Right. We'll have to
go over this a lot more.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.873
We've made
three passes already.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.514
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.519
No, no, no. The smell has got
to be gone completely.

06:41.680 --> 06:45.230
My wife is coming home,
and I can't have any odor, any stain,

06:45.400 --> 06:48.598
any sign that anything
happened here.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.234
Understand?

06:51.200 --> 06:55.797
I... I know. This is short notice,
and I really appreciate it.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.390
Sir, we'd love to take
more of your money,

06:58.600 --> 07:01.240
but you've got gas soaked
through to your subfloor.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.399
Until you pull this up and
get new carpet, new padding,

07:04.560 --> 07:06.756
this is as good as it gets.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.518
Is that gasoline?

09:25.680 --> 09:28.673
Ask Dad.
Hey. Over here.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.795
What happened?
What happened is that

09:32.960 --> 09:35.270
I should sue someone.
That's what happened.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.911
So I'm on my way to the drugstore,
and I have to stop to get some gas

09:39.080 --> 09:42.073
and there is this
total pump malfunction.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.391
You know what?
She shouldn't be in this room.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.320
I mean, this is supposedly green,
but you know how it is.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.877
You can close the windows
in the nursery

09:50.040 --> 09:52.714
because it's really
only out here.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.035
This is as good as it gets.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.633
So, uh...

10:12.680 --> 10:13.830
pump malfunction?

10:14.080 --> 10:17.437
Yeah. I'm standing there filling up
like I've done a thousand times

10:17.640 --> 10:21.554
and I hear a chunk.
You know, the pump's nozzle.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.871
The metal thing.
The thing you squeeze?

10:24.040 --> 10:28.273
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naivetÃ©

10:28.480 --> 10:31.996
I took to understand that gas is
no longer coming out of the nozzle

10:32.160 --> 10:35.198
so I pull out the hose
to put it back and whoosh!

10:35.440 --> 10:37.955
Yeah, I am suddenly
soaked in gasoline.

10:38.120 --> 10:42.353
I mean, on my arms
and my legs and my groin.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.837
So now I am in a panic.
I race home, I run inside the house,

10:48.040 --> 10:50.555
and I'm stripping off
my clothes as fast as I can.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.790
I jump in the shower.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.231
It's not until
after I get out of the shower

10:54.400 --> 10:57.757
that I realize
my gas-covered clothes

10:57.920 --> 11:02.517
have been soaking in the living
room rug this entire time.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.231
I mean, it's... It's...
The whole thing is just so stupid.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.676
I could have rinsed off
at the station.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.672
Halfway home, I started to realize,

11:10.840 --> 11:14.470
wait a minute, there's a water hose
right there next to the air pump.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.790
You know, for tires.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.952
Anyway, so that was my day.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.316
How was yours?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.791
Dad?
Yeah.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.116
Please, can you just tell the truth?

11:30.480 --> 11:33.632
Tell... What do you mean?

11:34.520 --> 11:36.637
You fainted, didn't you?

11:37.920 --> 11:39.639
Because you're sick again?

11:39.840 --> 11:42.230
You were pumping gas,
and the fumes,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.710
they made you pass out again.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.076
Just... Just admit it.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.391
No, the... No.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.114
It was the pump.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.756
All right, I...

11:57.920 --> 12:01.800
Maybe I did get a little
swimmy at one point

12:01.960 --> 12:04.077
but I did not faint. Okay?

12:04.280 --> 12:06.636
I'm fine, and that's the truth.

12:06.800 --> 12:11.556
However, in the best interest
of all of our continued good health,

12:11.760 --> 12:13.672
I don't think we can stay here.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.513
I mean,
not until we get new carpet.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.670
Yeah.

12:16.880 --> 12:21.875
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,
they got plenty of space.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.315
Hey, what about a hotel?

12:23.520 --> 12:26.035
A hotel. That could be sweet.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.799
A good one.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.311
I like the way you're thinking. Yes.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.318
Could be a little family vacation.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.079
Might be fun.
What do you say?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.072
Why don't you put
some clothes together.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.550
Yeah. All right.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.672
I'm sorry. It's not my finest hour.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.400
I'll go pack a bag.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.034
Okay.
Okay.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.390
Think this'll leave a scar?

12:57.680 --> 13:01.390
I never should have let
my dojo membership run out.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.716
Jesus. Jesse did that?

13:08.880 --> 13:12.556
Yeah, but you gotta understand,
deep down he loves me.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.031
So where is he?

13:16.200 --> 13:19.034
Still looking.
Where have you looked?

13:19.240 --> 13:23.598
His place, his folk's place,
this Brock kid's place.

13:23.760 --> 13:28.471
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills,
the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,

13:28.640 --> 13:31.474
go-kart joint on Copper Ave,

13:31.640 --> 13:33.154
AA meeting off the 40.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.710
His buddies,
Beaver and what's-his-name?

13:35.960 --> 13:38.998
Badger and Skinny Pete.
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.879
They could be
covering for him.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.351
I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug
on the tall kid's mom's place.

13:44.520 --> 13:48.878
For three hours straight, all he talked
about was something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>

13:49.040 --> 13:50.759
I checked with my gal at A.P.D.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.799
Pinkman's not in their system

13:52.960 --> 13:54.838
so the cops don't have him.
Yet.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.351
Maybe he changed his mind
about leaving,

13:57.560 --> 13:58.755
called your guy back.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.670
Somebody misses their first chance
with my guy, there's no second.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.639
Well, keep looking.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.439
What then?

14:08.360 --> 14:09.635
What do you mean?

14:09.800 --> 14:11.519
I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.194
Sooner or later, he'll turn up.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.876
I'm wondering what you wanna do
when he does.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.072
Jesse is upset about the boy.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.756
I just need to explain to him
why that had to happen.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.437
Okay, but say, you know,
just for the sake of argument,

14:29.600 --> 14:32.718
the kid's not in the mood
for a nuanced discussion

14:32.880 --> 14:34.837
of the virtues of child poisoning.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.152
His plans are running more towards
stabbing you to death

14:38.320 --> 14:41.996
with a pointed stick.
In that scenario, then what?

14:43.440 --> 14:44.715
You have a suggestion?

14:45.880 --> 14:51.080
We were wondering if maybe this
isn't an Old Yeller type situation.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.756
Old Yeller?

14:54.720 --> 14:58.270
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,
most loyal dog there ever was.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.397
I mean, everybody loved that mutt

15:00.560 --> 15:03.234
but one day he showed up rabid

15:03.400 --> 15:07.235
and little Timmy,
for Old Yeller's own sake,

15:07.400 --> 15:09.153
had to, uh...

15:10.280 --> 15:11.794
Oh, you... You saw the movie.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.595
You're full of colorful metaphors,
aren't you, Saul?

15:17.800 --> 15:19.837
Belize, Old Yeller...

15:20.000 --> 15:21.753
Just brimming with advice.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.793
Do not float that idea again.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.199
Find him.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.595
Sorry. Ah. Sorry.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.951
Room key wouldn't
let me into the ice room

15:54.120 --> 15:57.352
so I had to go down
to the front desk.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.358
But here we are.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.313
Checked in on Junior.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.997
Heh. Pay-per-view and room service.
He's in heaven.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.351
Hey, I thought you
were gonna take a bath.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.716
How's Saul doing?

16:12.840 --> 16:16.277
Saul? Goodman?

16:19.280 --> 16:22.159
No idea.
No?

16:22.840 --> 16:25.355
You were just out talking to him
in the parking lot.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.518
I'm sorry. Were you spying on me?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.035
Yes.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.954
And I feel just awful about it too.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.833
You know, I played along

16:39.000 --> 16:40.957
with your pump malfunction
bullshit

16:41.120 --> 16:43.271
because Junior
was standing right there,

16:43.480 --> 16:47.554
but now I would like to know
what's going on.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.760
First of all, it's no big deal.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.072
Coming here is just me
being overly cautious.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.119
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

17:07.319 --> 17:12.474
He came over to our house
that time for dinner, remember?

17:12.640 --> 17:17.476
Well, he... He got upset over this...

17:18.800 --> 17:21.109
Something he thinks I did.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.316
I did do it.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.480
But I did it for very good reasons.
And it's just... It's complicated.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.711
Wait, are you...?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.520
Are you telling me that he tried to

17:34.360 --> 17:35.635
burn our house down?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.916
That was...

17:40.640 --> 17:43.474
probably, for a brief moment,
his intention,

17:43.640 --> 17:46.394
but, obviously,
he changed his mind.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.951
And how does that work?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.680
Him...? Him changing his mind?

17:52.920 --> 17:55.037
Ah, God.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.993
Look...

18:01.080 --> 18:03.356
You've got to understand
that with Jesse,

18:03.560 --> 18:09.192
there are emotional issues,
personal issues, some drug abuse.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.440
But he has always been more of
a danger to himself than anyone else.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.470
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle, that's all.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.680
So he has never hurt anybody?

18:27.120 --> 18:28.395
No.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.071
I can't believe
you got her down so fast.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.153
So...

18:42.840 --> 18:45.196
what's your course of action here?

18:48.080 --> 18:52.472
Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down,
which shouldn't take long,

18:52.640 --> 18:55.200
and when he does, I'm gonna...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.719
I'm gonna talk to him.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.439
Make him see reason.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.593
Talk to him?

19:04.680 --> 19:06.637
Make him see reason?

19:10.560 --> 19:12.472
So I'm clear...

19:14.080 --> 19:16.640
these are just euphemisms

19:16.840 --> 19:18.957
you're using here, right?

19:19.520 --> 19:20.795
No.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.200
What?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.959
Wh...? What does that mean?

19:26.120 --> 19:30.478
My God.
I knew this was going to happen.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.314
I knew it. I told you that someday,

19:33.560 --> 19:36.473
someone was going to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.960
And now here we are.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.236
No.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.716
Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.157
He poured gasoline
all over our house, Walt.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.676
He tried to set our house on fire.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.991
He changed his mind.
He didn't do it, did he?

19:50.160 --> 19:51.276
What if he changes it back?

19:53.520 --> 19:58.117
Walt, you need

19:58.280 --> 19:59.873
to deal with this.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.596
How much have you had to drink?
Heh, heh.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.360
Not nearly enough.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.352
I don't know how we got off

20:06.520 --> 20:09.877
on whatever it is
we're talking about here...

20:11.040 --> 20:14.033
but, clearly, I haven't explained
the situation well enough

20:14.200 --> 20:16.157
because this is a big overreaction.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.036
We all need to just take
a deep breath and calm down

20:20.200 --> 20:23.113
because Jesse isn't just some...

20:23.320 --> 20:26.438
Some... Some rabid dog.

20:26.600 --> 20:31.311
This is a person.
A person that is a threat to us.

20:31.480 --> 20:36.953
I mean, my God, where we are now
with Hank and Marie

20:37.120 --> 20:39.271
and that awful tape we made.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.875
After everything we've done,

20:42.040 --> 20:44.475
you can't just talk to this person.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.320
You're saying...

20:48.800 --> 20:50.871
that I just...

20:52.800 --> 20:56.430
What...? What exactly are you saying?

20:57.360 --> 20:59.875
We've come this far.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.359
For us.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.038
What's one more?

22:00.400 --> 22:01.595
Jesse!

22:01.760 --> 22:04.320
Stop what you're doing
and turn and face me!

22:06.520 --> 22:08.830
You wanna...?
You wanna know what he did?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.195
You wanna hear about it?

22:10.360 --> 22:13.034
Jesse, put out the lighter.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.034
He poisoned a little kid.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.035
An 8-year-old boy.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.237
Just because, you know...

22:20.440 --> 22:21.954
Just as a move!

22:22.120 --> 22:24.589
Walt's a bastard. Secret's out.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.870
We'll talk about it.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.953
But I need you to put out
the lighter, okay?

22:30.520 --> 22:31.840
Look, Jesse...

22:32.720 --> 22:34.473
Jesse, I don't wanna kill you.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.111
And you don't wanna be killed.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.158
So put it out.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.949
He can't keep getting away with it!

22:48.440 --> 22:50.193
He can't keep getting away with it!

22:50.360 --> 22:51.476
He won't.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.351
You really wanna burn him down?

22:58.840 --> 23:00.718
Let's do it together.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.836
You were following me?

23:57.360 --> 24:00.034
Yeah. Since Goodman's.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.752
Where we going now?

24:04.160 --> 24:06.914
DEA. Downtown.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.520
What, I'm, like, arrested?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.072
Yeah, you know how this works.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.311
Be a good witness for me,

24:16.480 --> 24:18.278
it'll go better for you.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.951
Yeah, sitting around MDC,

24:22.160 --> 24:24.391
waiting to be a witness
against Mr. White.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.756
It's... Heh.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.111
It's gonna go great for me.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.920
So...

24:40.680 --> 24:42.478
you're angry.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.200
I can't sleep. I'm not eating.

24:48.920 --> 24:53.312
Last night, I was online for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.278
This close family friend

24:55.440 --> 24:57.875
had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

24:58.320 --> 25:01.950
and somehow this person's secret
became known,

25:02.120 --> 25:05.830
and now you're sad and hurt
and angry.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.871
I'm...? I'm in the ballpark?

25:12.960 --> 25:15.759
To be this wrong
about someone.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.832
This off.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.118
We all lead double lives
to some extent, don't we?

25:21.280 --> 25:24.273
We all have our secrets.
Yeah. Not like this.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.279
Not like him.

25:30.080 --> 25:34.313
Marie, I think it's time you filled me in
on some more details here.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.472
Who and what are we talking about?

25:36.680 --> 25:38.433
I said I can't do that.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.871
It'd be bad for Hank.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.398
Our friend made that clear
in his little movie.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.833
Those kids...

25:52.400 --> 25:54.756
under his roof. That baby.

25:54.920 --> 25:59.199
I'm sick just thinking about it.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.591
How could I have not seen this?

26:03.960 --> 26:06.475
If I weren't being such a...

26:07.440 --> 26:10.751
idiotic... Stupid idiot, I could've...

26:10.960 --> 26:12.952
We could have...

26:17.600 --> 26:19.114
Blackjack winnings.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.115
Nothing suspicious about that at all.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.556
Tell me about this movie.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.872
Dave, can we simply

26:28.040 --> 26:30.236
just focus on my feelings here?

26:30.480 --> 26:35.111
The details don't really matter, do they?
There's nothing to be done, okay?

26:35.320 --> 26:37.152
He screwed us and he won.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.759
Can we just...?

26:40.680 --> 26:42.637
Can we talk about
something else, please?

26:42.800 --> 26:44.519
Yes?

26:46.720 --> 26:48.439
How's work?

26:49.120 --> 26:52.511
Last week, you were upset
about the new parking rules.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.354
Marie?

27:01.280 --> 27:03.237
Saxitoxin.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.949
Derived from shellfish.

27:06.120 --> 27:10.512
Produces a flaccid paralysis
that leaves the victim conscious

27:10.680 --> 27:13.479
through a progression of symptoms.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.272
Death occurs from respiratory failure.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.114
That is definitely a contender.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.598
Marie,

27:21.760 --> 27:24.912
you're not ready to fill me in here,

27:25.160 --> 27:26.799
that's fine.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.391
But I want you to listen.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.677
There is no problem,
no matter how difficult

27:33.880 --> 27:36.839
or painful or seemingly unsolvable,

27:37.000 --> 27:38.957
that violence won't make worse.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.993
I know, I...

27:42.880 --> 27:44.758
Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.479
I just...

27:51.040 --> 27:54.431
It just feels good to think about it.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.829
Hey, babe.
What's the story here?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.957
Oh, well, something's come up.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.232
I thought you might wanna get out
of the house for a day or two.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.915
You thought I'd pack up
and move out of my own house.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.400
Why? What's going on?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.673
Look, I don't wanna get into it now.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.031
But you know that thing with Walt,
there's...

28:19.200 --> 28:21.510
There's been a development.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.519
What happened? Are you in danger?
No, no, no, not at all.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.677
Just... It's a fluid situation.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.560
I think it might go a little smoother
if you're not here.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.791
So I... It's gonna be great, you know?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.395
I booked you a spa package
at La Posada.

28:34.560 --> 28:38.474
You can do that river-stones thing.
Hank, what the hell is going on?

28:40.600 --> 28:42.034
Hank?

28:42.840 --> 28:44.354
We have a guest.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.670
He was a little keyed up.
Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.712
Okay. Okay, so listen.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.076
I bring that kid in,
put him in the system,

29:09.240 --> 29:11.835
Walt's gonna find out
five minutes later. You know?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.151
My last 10 witnesses
died in jail, remember?

29:14.320 --> 29:17.313
And I can't use a DEA safe house
without writing him up.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.113
I can't risk a motel.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.920
I know it sounds crazy,
but this is the best place.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.390
For now.
Just a day or two, tops...

29:24.560 --> 29:26.756
Okay, just answer me
this one question:

29:26.920 --> 29:28.798
Is this bad for Walt?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.480
Yeah. Very.

29:31.680 --> 29:35.469
Good. I'm staying.
I'll heat up lasagna.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.269
Phone's ringing.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.513
<i>You have one new message.</i>

29:58.000 --> 30:00.959
<i>Jesse, listen. Uh...</i>

30:01.920 --> 30:05.470
<i>I mean, obviously,
you've changed your mind here</i>

30:05.840 --> 30:07.479
<i>and so thank you for that.</i>

30:07.640 --> 30:09.677
<i>And I know you're angry.</i>

30:10.320 --> 30:12.789
<i>I wanna fix this, okay?</i>

30:13.160 --> 30:15.516
<i>Whatever it takes, all right?</i>

30:15.680 --> 30:17.717
<i>We'll talk, and we will fix this.</i>

30:19.760 --> 30:21.638
<i>Until then, just...</i>

30:22.720 --> 30:25.394
<i>Just sleep it off, okay?</i>

30:25.560 --> 30:27.358
<i>And then call me.</i>

30:28.360 --> 30:29.794
<i>Be safe.</i>

30:57.240 --> 30:58.435
Hey.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.515
Hey.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.759
What are you still doing up?

31:02.960 --> 31:04.155
Couldn't sleep.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.950
Ah. You and me both.
Here. Have a seat.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.276
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.560
Just business stuff.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.077
Going over some options.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.517
You guys still think
you might buy another car wash?

31:30.720 --> 31:33.713
Oh, uh... Yeah. Well, maybe.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.519
See how it goes.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.320
How it goes now that...

31:37.800 --> 31:40.838
Now that you're...
You're sick again, right?

31:41.040 --> 31:44.238
No. That's not what I mean.

31:44.440 --> 31:47.080
Hey. Told you not to worry,
remember?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.630
How...? How can I not worry?

31:49.880 --> 31:52.714
Come on.
You think I came all this way

31:52.880 --> 31:57.318
just to let something as silly
as lung cancer take me down?

31:58.280 --> 32:00.033
Not a chance.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.431
I'm not going anywhere.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.311
Should've brought
our suits, huh?

32:22.120 --> 32:23.918
It's okay.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.273
It's all right.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.479
I'll be up in a minute.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.114
Okay.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.954
See you in the morning.
Okay.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.720
Would you like some coffee?

34:04.080 --> 34:05.400
Morning.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.633
You want some coffee?

34:07.960 --> 34:10.600
No. The lady, um...

34:10.840 --> 34:12.353
I think your wife...

34:12.520 --> 34:14.000
You take cream and sugar?

34:14.159 --> 34:17.039
Uh... Black's...
Black's good.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.799
Thanks.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.120
Thanks.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.112
Thanks.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.469
This is probably
gonna take a while.

34:48.679 --> 34:50.194
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.277
I'll run some errands.
Okay.

34:52.719 --> 34:53.995
All right.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.119
Uh... You remember Agent Gomez?

35:01.240 --> 35:04.119
How you feeling? Your head clear?
Yeah.

35:05.120 --> 35:09.751
This... This can't be what you mean
by burning him to the ground, right?

35:10.560 --> 35:12.711
I got stories that'll make your toes curl,

35:12.920 --> 35:16.960
but, you know, it's just "my word
against his word" kind of stuff.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.352
So, you know, I don't really
have any, like, proof or anything.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.512
Gomey, can you grab
the curtains over there?

35:22.720 --> 35:25.189
There's a glare thing
happening here.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.280
You know he's retired,
right? He's...

35:30.480 --> 35:32.199
He's not even
in the business anymore.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.631
So you're never gonna catch him
with a camcorder.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.271
We're gonna catch him. We gotta
do this first, okay? Come on.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.079
Just tell us everything
you remember.

35:48.400 --> 35:51.359
Any business dealings,
any personal dealings,

35:51.520 --> 35:54.672
any criminal activity
you were a witness or a party to.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.473
Anything and everything.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.394
Just tell us your story, okay?

36:01.160 --> 36:04.870
Start from the beginning.
When did you first meet Walter White?

36:06.920 --> 36:08.912
Right. Okay, uh...

36:10.800 --> 36:15.397
I first met Mr. White...

36:15.600 --> 36:17.592
Walter White.

36:17.920 --> 36:21.277
...in junior year chemistry.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.837
He was my teacher.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.760
You believe him?

36:42.920 --> 36:45.833
Yeah. I do, unfortunately.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.554
And I hate to admit it,
but I think the kid is right.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.830
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.230
Yeah, well, no weapons,
no bodies, no working lab.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.035
Just the word
of one nut-job meth-head

37:00.200 --> 37:03.159
against
Mr. Rogers-Has-a-Lung-Tumor.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.477
So do we take a run
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

37:05.640 --> 37:08.758
Vamonos Pest? Follow up with
the Drew Sharp killing?

37:08.920 --> 37:10.274
Where do we start?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.520
I say we start with this.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.353
<i>Jesse...</i>

37:15.600 --> 37:18.957
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza
tomorrow at noon.</i>

37:20.360 --> 37:23.797
<i>I hope you'll give me the chance
to explain myself</i>

37:24.400 --> 37:27.438
<i>and talk through everything
once and for all.</i>

37:29.640 --> 37:32.519
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>

37:33.720 --> 37:37.714
<i>So if you wanna come and shoot me
in the head, that's up to you.</i>

37:39.520 --> 37:41.318
<i>Either way...</i>

37:42.680 --> 37:44.751
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>

37:56.000 --> 37:58.310
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.870
Go and talk to that asshole?

38:01.080 --> 38:02.275
You can't be serious.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.353
Go and listen.
He wants to explain himself.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.512
We put a wire on you
and let him explain.

38:07.720 --> 38:11.031
So your plan is to do his plan?

38:11.200 --> 38:13.032
You seriously think that this...?

38:13.200 --> 38:16.159
This whole
"once and for all in the plaza" thing

38:16.320 --> 38:17.913
is so he can talk to me?

38:18.080 --> 38:19.719
Why not?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.631
I... I... I can't believe you two.

38:24.080 --> 38:27.312
The dude wanted me out of town
before I came to burn his house down,

38:27.480 --> 38:29.358
and now I'm more of a threat to him.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.319
And he's got a zero-tolerance policy
on threats, you know?

38:32.480 --> 38:35.439
If I go to this plaza,
I'm a dead man, is why not.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.592
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.878
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

38:41.040 --> 38:44.920
I agree.
Except when it comes to you.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.917
He cares about you.
Heh.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.236
Can't you see?

38:49.400 --> 38:54.680
Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not
ripping me off or calling me an idiot

38:54.840 --> 38:57.674
or poisoning people
that I care about?

38:57.840 --> 39:00.958
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.840
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.957
Uh, he paid for your rehab,

39:06.200 --> 39:08.510
ran over those two drug dealers
with his car.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.160
Sounds like he saved your life.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.676
Made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.878
Yeah, he sort of did. I'm the
only one near as good as him.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.719
I don't know. The way you tell it,

39:17.880 --> 39:20.031
sounds like he's manipulating you
to stick around.

39:20.200 --> 39:23.272
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.
All those numbers he runs on you

39:23.440 --> 39:26.080
over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.913
Look how far he'll go to show you...

39:28.080 --> 39:30.754
To convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.594
That's what this is.
What if it's about, um,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.558
killing me, you know?

39:36.080 --> 39:37.912
You know, getting me out in the open,

39:38.080 --> 39:41.312
hire some, uh...
Some clock-tower guy

39:41.520 --> 39:45.036
or have me sit on a poisoned needle
or something, you know?

39:45.200 --> 39:46.600
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

39:46.760 --> 39:50.436
The plaza's one of the most wide-open
public places in all of Albuquerque.

39:50.600 --> 39:51.920
It's the middle of the day.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.675
And Agent Gomez and I will
be right there with you.

39:54.840 --> 40:00.040
Look, you two guys
are just guys, okay?

40:00.200 --> 40:03.955
Mr. White, he's the devil.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.112
You know, he is.
He is smarter than you,

40:06.280 --> 40:08.351
he is luckier than you.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.115
Whatever... Whatever you think
is supposed to happen,

40:11.640 --> 40:14.553
I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite of that

40:14.760 --> 40:16.240
is gonna happen, okay?

40:16.400 --> 40:20.110
Jesse, Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.431
This is not asking.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.430
Unless you know another way to get the
man or you wanna take your chances

40:26.600 --> 40:29.593
with the banger boys over in MDC,
then this is it.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.480
This is what's happening.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.597
I gotta piss. Can I piss?
Yeah. Down to the left.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.472
You got another SD card?

40:44.920 --> 40:47.116
What?
What if the kid's right?

40:47.280 --> 40:48.475
What if it's a trap?

40:49.360 --> 40:50.840
The kid?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.071
Oh, you mean the junkie murderer

40:53.240 --> 40:55.675
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

40:57.480 --> 40:59.358
Well, then, he's right.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.517
Pinkman gets killed,

41:01.960 --> 41:03.997
and we get it all on tape.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.917
Remember, you're hurt, angry,
but you're here for answers, okay?

41:15.080 --> 41:17.834
But don't... Don't push the questions.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.799
Okay?
Let's not get him suspicious, all right?

41:20.960 --> 41:23.634
You let him do the talking, right?

41:24.240 --> 41:26.118
Just relax.
That's what matters most.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.272
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.629
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.593
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
You getting that?</i>

41:34.800 --> 41:37.998
Loud and clear, <i>idiota.
How's it looking, Gomey?</i>

41:39.160 --> 41:40.674
No change.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.559
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

41:42.720 --> 41:44.040
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

41:44.640 --> 41:46.632
Ready to kick some ass, partner?

41:50.720 --> 41:53.030
All right. Time to go.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.039
Okay.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.036
Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

43:15.200 --> 43:17.078
He's just standing there.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.591
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>

43:42.320 --> 43:45.791
He's on the move now.
He's taking off. I think he's running.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.952
Oh, no, no, no, kid. Come on.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.760
You got him? He's at the pay phone.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.912
Who the hell is he calling?

44:04.400 --> 44:06.437
Oh, no, no, no. Come on, kid.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.239
No. Come on.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.430
Hello?

44:23.280 --> 44:25.476
Nice try, asshole.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.915
Jesse, where are you?

44:29.080 --> 44:30.150
I just wanna talk.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.518
No. I'm not doing what you want
anymore. Okay, asshole?

44:33.680 --> 44:36.832
<i>This is just a heads-up
to let you know I'm coming for you.</i>

44:38.000 --> 44:41.516
See, I decided that burning down
your house is nothing.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.913
Next time, I'm gonna get you
where you really live.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.958
Jesse, listen.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.553
Jesse? Jesse?

45:14.720 --> 45:17.440
Daddy! Daddy!
Hey!

45:30.760 --> 45:32.274
Get in.

45:33.280 --> 45:36.000
Son of a bitch!
Stupid, high little...

45:36.160 --> 45:37.674
What the hell
was that all about?

45:37.880 --> 45:39.314
What were you thinking?

45:39.480 --> 45:41.472
Thinking there's another way.
What?

45:42.440 --> 45:45.274
To get him.
There's another way.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.152
A better way.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.353
Hey.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.352
It's Walt.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.600
I'm okay.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.672
I, uh...

46:22.800 --> 46:24.200
Todd...

46:24.360 --> 46:27.990
I think I might have another job
for your uncle.
