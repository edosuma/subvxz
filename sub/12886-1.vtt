00:09.540 --> 00:14.500
In the 17th century, there was only
one place to see and be seen.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.420
The Palace of Versailles.

00:17.420 --> 00:20.580
The greatest legacy of Louis XIV.

00:20.580 --> 00:21.980
The Sun King.

00:23.180 --> 00:28.340
Louis XIV spent a whopping 72 years
on the throne.

00:28.340 --> 00:32.659
During his reign, he turned France
from a country racked by civil war,

00:32.659 --> 00:36.180
its dukes and nobles constantly at
each other's throats,

00:36.180 --> 00:39.820
into the most glorious and powerful
state in Europe.

00:39.820 --> 00:42.460
And he came up with a way of running
a royal court

00:42.460 --> 00:45.140
that's never been beaten.

00:45.140 --> 00:46.940
Key to his success was this -

00:46.940 --> 00:48.980
his Palace of Versailles.

00:50.940 --> 00:56.220
I'm Lucy Worsley, chief curator at
Britain's Historic Royal Palaces.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.980
And I'm Helen Castor, a historian
with an unhealthy interest

00:59.980 --> 01:02.300
in court politics and intrigue.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.660
Together, we're taking a look at
the new French-produced drama

01:07.660 --> 01:10.740
being shown on the BBC.

01:10.740 --> 01:14.060
It's set during the building of
Versailles.

01:14.060 --> 01:18.940
This was a world where life revolved
around endless court rituals.

01:18.940 --> 01:23.340
Where fortunes rose and fell
with the latest fashions.

01:23.340 --> 01:28.380
And where the quickest way to royal
favour was through the king's
bedchamber.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.900
Take it off.

01:29.900 --> 01:33.300
Behind the facade,
Louis XIV's survival

01:33.300 --> 01:35.900
depended on his creation of
Versailles.

01:36.940 --> 01:39.980
It was his power base,
his safe house

01:39.980 --> 01:44.860
and the gilded cage in which
he trapped his enemies.

01:44.860 --> 01:46.860
Never before had a king

01:46.860 --> 01:50.340
and his entire court lived together
in a single palace.

01:50.340 --> 01:54.260
This was a new type of building
for a new type of ruler.

01:54.260 --> 01:58.700
It was a huge risk. It could all
have gone horribly wrong.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.940
But if anybody could pull it off,
it was Louis XIV.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074

02:15.940 --> 02:18.580
Louis's Palace at Versailles
sprang from

02:18.580 --> 02:20.620
surprisingly humble beginnings.

02:22.260 --> 02:26.260
Even the king's only brother,
Philippe, was in for a shock.

02:27.700 --> 02:31.860
I am about to drag this country out
of the darkness into the light.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.020
We must build our own destiny.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.020
Right here a new France will be born
and this palace will be her mother.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.660
What palace?

02:41.660 --> 02:43.140
That one.

02:44.980 --> 02:46.820
Our father's hunting lodge?

02:48.860 --> 02:50.060
Versailles.

02:57.180 --> 03:01.660
The dilapidated hunting lodge and
the tiny hamlet around it was

03:01.660 --> 03:05.300
buried in the countryside,
12 miles from Paris.

03:08.100 --> 03:13.420
The only link between Versailles
and the capital was an old drover's
track.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.940
It had been used for bringing cattle
to the markets of Paris.

03:16.940 --> 03:20.340
In other words, Versailles was in
the middle of nowhere.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.180
The seat of power was Paris,

03:22.180 --> 03:24.980
the royal residence was
the Palace of the Louvre.

03:24.980 --> 03:26.940
The nobles had their homes close by,

03:26.940 --> 03:31.540
which meant they could attend on the
king and still enjoy salon society

03:31.540 --> 03:34.140
in the capital and vive la
difference.

03:34.140 --> 03:37.180
But Louis was passionate about
outdoor pursuits.

03:37.180 --> 03:39.420
He really enjoyed country life.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.380
He began to spend more and more time
at Versailles.

03:45.340 --> 03:48.140
Louis expected his courtiers
to join him.

03:49.860 --> 03:53.620
But not everybody wanted to travel
out into the sticks.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.300
You really are out in the wilds
here.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.900
Defences are porous, non-existent.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.260
The sooner we return to Paris,
the better.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.700
And even after the dukes
and duchesses,

04:05.700 --> 04:09.180
the counts and marquises that had
made it out to Versailles,

04:09.180 --> 04:12.340
there was nowhere decent
for them to stay.

04:12.340 --> 04:15.820
According to Madame de Sevigne,
after one visit to Versailles

04:15.820 --> 04:17.820
the courtiers were in a fury,

04:17.820 --> 04:20.620
because they said the king didn't
take care of any of them

04:20.620 --> 04:23.940
and there were scarcely a hole
to take shelter in.

04:23.940 --> 04:27.780
The courtiers came up with a new
witticism - a bon mot -

04:27.780 --> 04:31.340
"Versailles..." they said, "..is a
mistress without merit."

04:34.700 --> 04:38.900
But the modest hunting lodge was
about to have a makeover.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.580
When I hosted a party
a few years ago,

04:42.580 --> 04:45.540
we did not have the room to
accommodate my friends.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.860
Most of them had to take rooms in
town.

04:47.860 --> 04:50.100
So I'm building some myself.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.940
400 apartments, all told.

04:56.220 --> 05:00.220
Louis incorporated this hunting
lodge into his plans.

05:00.220 --> 05:04.180
And it's still there, right at the
heart of the later building.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.460
Louis added additions that are still
known as the "enveloppe",

05:07.460 --> 05:10.460
literally enveloping the original
building.

05:10.460 --> 05:14.100
From sleeping a cosy 15 or so extra
guests,

05:14.100 --> 05:16.740
this first phase of construction
provided room

05:16.740 --> 05:21.180
at Versailles for 600 of Louis's
closest friends.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.020
And that was just the start.

05:24.340 --> 05:28.700
But Louis didn't build Versailles to
be nice to his chums.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.060
He did it for the survival
of the monarchy.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.460
HE SIGHS

05:36.220 --> 05:40.620
You might be forgiven for wondering
why Louis XIV would go to

05:40.620 --> 05:43.900
such lengths to keep
his throne safe.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.380
As a royal historian, it's hard to
think of another ruler

05:47.380 --> 05:51.340
who comes across as so supremely
confident.

05:51.340 --> 05:54.700
Louis inherited from his mother
a passionate belief

05:54.700 --> 05:57.740
in the divine right of kings.

05:57.740 --> 06:02.660
The idea that kings were like little
mini-gods who ruled on Earth.

06:02.660 --> 06:05.260
In case anyone had missed the point,
at Louis's birth,

06:05.260 --> 06:09.740
he was given the name of
"Dieudonne", "Given by God".

06:09.740 --> 06:13.540
This is because, miraculously,
he was his parents' first

06:13.540 --> 06:19.620
surviving child after 23 years of
marriage, a gift from God indeed.

06:19.620 --> 06:22.660
Louis took these ideas
very much to heart.

06:25.780 --> 06:29.420
Louis's self-glorification
knew no bounds.

06:30.860 --> 06:35.340
He had himself painted in the guise
of Roman emperors.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.700
As Alexander the Great.

06:37.700 --> 06:41.620
Even as the omnipotent Greek God,
Zeus.

06:41.620 --> 06:47.020
No hero was too glorious, no God too
mighty to escape the comparison.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.900
And Louis took as his personal
emblem a symbol

06:51.900 --> 06:55.860
he thought fitting for his dazzling
godlike status.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.700
The sun.

07:02.060 --> 07:05.820
The sun is the centre,

07:05.820 --> 07:09.700
the heart, the mother of the
universe.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.860
Without its warmth and light,
all life is gone.

07:13.860 --> 07:15.220
Man will cease to exist.

07:17.340 --> 07:20.100
One could almost believe
he was talking about you.

07:21.660 --> 07:24.300
Louis was a master of propaganda.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.940
But don't let all this grandstanding
deceive you.

07:28.940 --> 07:32.020
In some ways, it was a sign of
weakness.

07:32.020 --> 07:35.860
If he had been absolutely powerful
and totally secure

07:35.860 --> 07:38.500
on his throne, then he needn't have
bothered.

07:41.540 --> 07:45.700
Louis had learned that being king
was a dangerous business.

07:47.780 --> 07:49.860
THUNDER CRASHES

07:49.860 --> 07:50.900
Are you scared?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.740
Of course you are.

07:56.980 --> 07:59.100
If history teaches us one thing...

08:00.540 --> 08:02.260
..it is this.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.900
Terrible things happen to kings.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.180
HE SOBS

08:14.060 --> 08:17.900
Louis's greatest fears were founded
in the deep divisions

08:17.900 --> 08:20.060
within the country he inherited.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.980
In the 17th century,

08:22.980 --> 08:26.460
France wasn't by any means
the unified nation we know today.

08:26.460 --> 08:29.900
Different regions had
different laws, customs,

08:29.900 --> 08:32.020
even different languages.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.740
And vast parts of the country
were controlled

08:34.740 --> 08:37.820
not directly by the king,
but by great noblemen.

08:40.460 --> 08:44.540
The North and East,
who defies me there?

08:44.540 --> 08:47.980
The Duke of Cassel, sire, to my
mind, commands great influence.

08:47.980 --> 08:49.820
Half the nobility are in his debt,

08:49.820 --> 08:53.020
his family have occupied those lands
since before memory.

08:54.380 --> 08:58.980
These nobles had huge independent
powers in the regions they
dominated.

08:58.980 --> 09:02.180
They didn't even have to pay the
king's taxes.

09:02.180 --> 09:05.260
So the king was locked in a deadly
power struggle,

09:05.260 --> 09:08.300
constantly competing with
the nobles.

09:08.300 --> 09:12.140
Louis knew only too well how
vulnerable he was.

09:12.140 --> 09:15.180
And he'd known it pretty much
since the day he was born.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.140
During Louis's childhood,

09:18.140 --> 09:21.900
the monarchy had tried to wrest
control from the nobles.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.260
The result was a bitter civil war.

09:25.380 --> 09:30.620
In 1651, while Louis was staying in
Paris, a riot erupted.

09:30.620 --> 09:33.380
The violence came a little
too close to home.

09:35.260 --> 09:38.980
The mob broke into the palace and
demanded to see the young king.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.420
They marched into his bedroom where
Louis pretended to be asleep.

09:46.860 --> 09:50.940
The royal family managed to escape,
but Louis was traumatised.

09:58.620 --> 10:02.220
The incident had a profound effect
on Louis.

10:02.220 --> 10:06.220
From that moment on, he saw Paris
as a crucible of danger,

10:06.220 --> 10:10.220
where the people and the nobles
could plot against him.

10:10.220 --> 10:15.460
Never again would he let chaos and
violence threaten his very being.

10:16.500 --> 10:20.380
For Louis, the safest place from
which to rule was not Paris,

10:20.380 --> 10:22.620
but Versailles.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.660
We must lay our own foundation here.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.460
Why here, Sire? Because I will not
be the king of Paris.

10:32.420 --> 10:33.980
I know who I am.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.860
I'm Louis XIV.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.500
I'm king of France.

10:45.100 --> 10:49.940
To prove who was in charge, Louis
made himself an absolute monarch.

10:51.660 --> 10:55.420
He declared he was the sole ruler of
France

10:55.420 --> 10:58.140
and set about reining in the power
of the nobles.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.740
This is your king's new law.

11:03.740 --> 11:06.380
Stripping away the dignity of a true
noble,

11:06.380 --> 11:09.140
defiling the reputation of a man
whose family forms the bedrock

11:09.140 --> 11:10.980
of this country.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.660
Now, once, not long ago,
we knew where we stood.

11:14.820 --> 11:18.220
But now we must prove ourselves.
Now we must sing for our supper.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.700
Now the King says, "I am France!"

11:19.700 --> 11:23.340
But I say it is we who are France.

11:30.260 --> 11:35.620
In this battle, Louis had some
subtle new tactics in his armoury.

11:35.620 --> 11:40.180
Louis's solution to the problem of
his nobles shows just how good

11:40.180 --> 11:44.100
he was at wielding what you might
call soft power.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.940
He watched and learned from
the mistakes of other kings,

11:46.940 --> 11:49.340
like Charles I of England,
for example.

11:49.340 --> 11:53.220
He had taken up arms to defend his
Royal prerogative,

11:53.220 --> 11:54.820
and look what happened to him.

11:56.260 --> 12:00.420
But Louis wanted to wage war
with refinement.

12:00.420 --> 12:04.220
He planned to devastate his enemies
with his hospitality.

12:04.220 --> 12:06.300
He was going to overwhelm them

12:06.300 --> 12:09.900
with fancy titles that didn't
necessarily mean anything.

12:09.900 --> 12:13.620
And above all, he intended to
emasculate them

12:13.620 --> 12:16.580
by making them do trivial jobs in
his household,

12:16.580 --> 12:20.060
here at his new country
home of Versailles.

12:28.980 --> 12:31.300
It's no bigger than a broom
cupboard!

12:31.300 --> 12:34.860
As a matter of fact, I believe it
WAS a broom cupboard.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.700
Welcome to Versailles.

12:42.580 --> 12:46.260
Louis loved to play the host.

12:46.260 --> 12:50.500
He kept his courtiers busy
with gambling, feasting,

12:50.500 --> 12:54.740
hunting and to top it all,
fabulous parties.

13:07.780 --> 13:11.020
APPLAUSE

13:12.660 --> 13:15.620
Louis made sure his dazzling
hospitality

13:15.620 --> 13:18.140
would always be remembered.

13:18.140 --> 13:20.940
Let's have a look at our massive
book of pictures

13:20.940 --> 13:22.700
of one of Louis's parties.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.860
And here is Versailles, looking
extremely splendid.

13:26.860 --> 13:30.740
These specific drawings were of an
entertainment called

13:30.740 --> 13:33.380
"The Pleasures Of The Enchanted
Island".

13:33.380 --> 13:36.020
That's a very alluring name,
isn't it? It is.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.180
Although after six whole days
and six whole nights,

13:38.180 --> 13:40.900
I'm not sure how allured anyone
would have felt!

13:42.580 --> 13:48.180
It was an epic party based on an
epic poem, The Frenzy Of Orlando.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.500
The lead role was Roger.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.460
Could it be possible that Roger
himself was played by the King?

13:53.460 --> 13:55.500
I think you might have spotted
Louis's role

13:55.500 --> 13:57.140
that he chose for himself!

13:57.140 --> 14:00.580
Here, right in the middle, on his
magnificently rearing horse,

14:00.580 --> 14:02.220
is Roger.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.020
I wonder who was in charge of
casting?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.340
Louis was a natural showman.

14:12.340 --> 14:13.980
GUESTS GASP

14:15.780 --> 14:18.460
He had a reputation as a fine
dancer.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.980
And he never missed an opportunity
to display his talents.

14:34.100 --> 14:37.940
But here, the real star of the show
was Versailles.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.620
Ooh, look at this!

14:40.620 --> 14:44.060
This is the marble courtyard in the
heart of the palace, isn't it?

14:44.060 --> 14:46.700
Decorated with orange trees on
either side,

14:46.700 --> 14:48.940
to make it look even
more beautiful.

14:48.940 --> 14:50.620
It's splendid.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.020
Hundreds of candles
all around the top.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.820
Look at them standing on the ledges
inside the windows.

14:55.820 --> 14:58.580
It is truly... It was beautiful
enough before,

14:58.580 --> 15:02.140
but now it's transformed into an
night-time spectacular.

15:02.140 --> 15:05.140
And look, here's an orchestra.
So this is a musical performance.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.620
And they seem to be dancing on the
stage.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.580
Oh, it says it's a ballet!
That's right.

15:09.580 --> 15:12.260
And a ballet... Alceste.

15:12.260 --> 15:17.340
"A tragedy in music", composed
by Louis's own court composer,

15:17.340 --> 15:20.660
Jean-Baptiste Lully, one of the
greatest musicians of his day.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.260
Only the very best for Louis.

15:24.060 --> 15:28.140
The king was at pains to make sure
his guests didn't miss a single

15:28.140 --> 15:29.900
detail of his palace.

15:31.260 --> 15:34.820
One visitor gushed that the
festivities astonished

15:34.820 --> 15:39.820
the spectators by their
magnificence, novelty and pomp.

15:44.580 --> 15:47.660
Now, this really is a scene,
isn't it?

15:47.660 --> 15:51.100
A night-time scene of fireworks
and illuminations.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.860
The palace in the background,
the fountains in the foreground.

15:54.860 --> 15:58.820
What do you think, Helen, was the
point of this book of engravings?

15:58.820 --> 16:01.660
This is a big PR exercise.

16:01.660 --> 16:05.900
These are impressive pictures, even
centuries later, in black-and-white.

16:05.900 --> 16:10.380
But for the rest of Europe in 1664,
this is how you do it.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.820
So Louis compiled all the
engravings,

16:12.820 --> 16:14.820
gave them to ambassadors

16:14.820 --> 16:17.780
who would then take them home to
their own European king or

16:17.780 --> 16:20.740
queen and say, "Look and learn!
This is how they do it in France,

16:20.740 --> 16:22.740
"this is the way to hold a party!"

16:22.740 --> 16:24.580
And not just in France,

16:24.580 --> 16:27.140
but specifically at Versailles.

16:27.140 --> 16:29.980
Forget Paris, that was yesterday's
news.

16:29.980 --> 16:32.340
Louis wanted the eyes of the world

16:32.340 --> 16:35.140
to be on the palace
that he was building.

16:37.220 --> 16:40.620
Once Louis had captivated his
courtiers with the entertainments

16:40.620 --> 16:45.740
at Versailles, he found other ways
to keep them in thrall to him.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.820
To keep everybody in their places,

16:50.820 --> 16:54.940
Louis turned his life into a kind of
public spectacle.

16:54.940 --> 16:59.340
Every minute of every day was filled
with these weird rituals,

16:59.340 --> 17:01.220
some of them quite ridiculous,

17:01.220 --> 17:05.420
which all of the courtiers had to
follow, as if it were a religion.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.339
All the noblemen at court
are required to present

17:10.339 --> 17:12.140
themselves at the appointed hour.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.380
A-ah! Dukes before Marquis, I
believe?

17:15.780 --> 17:17.300
I'm with the Duke.

17:17.300 --> 17:22.500
Only a few, however, will be given
the privilege of entering,

17:22.500 --> 17:25.339
observing and in some cases,
participating.

17:26.819 --> 17:30.460
Taking part in Louis's daily
routines was a strictly

17:30.460 --> 17:32.660
controlled business.

17:32.660 --> 17:38.620
Only a chosen elite could share in
his more intimate moments.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.940
The most important ceremony
was the King's levee.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.700
His rising in the morning.

17:47.700 --> 17:53.060
It was as essential to life at
Versailles as the rising of the sun.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.820
At eight o'clock sharp,

17:54.820 --> 17:59.060
the curtains of the state bed were
drawn back to reveal the king.

17:59.060 --> 18:02.100
He may not have slept here,
but he had to get back in time.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.220
And then he was greeted by his
valet.

18:05.540 --> 18:06.780
Good morning.

18:06.780 --> 18:11.020
Next, in came the king's physician,
to check him over.

18:11.020 --> 18:15.140
His chamberpot was carried out and,
this is really nice,

18:15.140 --> 18:18.340
in came the king's nurse that he'd
had since he was a child,

18:18.340 --> 18:21.100
to give him his good morning kiss.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.260
Then came the privileged few who had
the right to attend what was

18:24.260 --> 18:26.460
known as the "Grande Entree".

18:26.460 --> 18:32.220
They were all highborn nobles and
they helped the king into his shirt.

18:32.220 --> 18:34.620
It sounds menial, but it was a huge
honour.

18:39.260 --> 18:43.740
All you do is designed to be seen
and admired.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.620
Dressing, shaving, drinking and
eating.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.820
They are no longer actions.
But a performance.

18:54.060 --> 18:57.500
Everything you do is a display of
wealth,

18:57.500 --> 18:58.780
authority,

18:58.780 --> 19:00.260
harmony and modesty.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.500
And last, but by no means least,

19:05.900 --> 19:07.900
piety.

19:10.740 --> 19:16.220
Louis thought of himself as a god
and now, he was worshipped like one.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.660
Even the most powerful nobles
were forced to bow and scrape.

19:23.980 --> 19:28.660
But observing Louis's strict daily
routine could reap rewards.

19:30.260 --> 19:33.620
The clockwork timing of Louis's day
meant the courtiers always

19:33.620 --> 19:37.580
knew exactly where the king was
and what he was doing.

19:37.580 --> 19:40.020
And that meant they could engineer
meetings with him,

19:40.020 --> 19:43.900
opportunities to ask for the favours
that only the king could give.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.500
Like other monarchs,

19:50.500 --> 19:54.220
the king had the power to transform
a courtier's fortunes.

19:56.740 --> 20:01.740
But Louis had his own special
criteria for granting requests.

20:04.380 --> 20:08.380
As Louis progressed for mass,
courtiers would line his route,

20:08.380 --> 20:12.700
pressing on either side, desperate
for a word in the King's ear.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.940
If they succeeded in catching
his attention,

20:14.940 --> 20:16.860
they might ask
a favour for a friend.

20:16.860 --> 20:19.820
But if Louis thought that that
particular nobleman hadn't

20:19.820 --> 20:21.380
spent enough time at Versailles,

20:21.380 --> 20:26.020
he turned the request down with
the words, "We never see him!

20:26.020 --> 20:30.420
"I don't know him!" It was as
if that noble had never existed.

20:32.260 --> 20:36.460
The message was clear - courtiers
had better sharpen their elbows

20:36.460 --> 20:39.140
and fight their way to
the front of the queue.

20:39.140 --> 20:40.940
If they wanted to get ahead in life,

20:40.940 --> 20:44.500
they had to put in the hours
at Versailles.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.460
The nobles were now too busy
vying for the King's

20:47.460 --> 20:50.780
attention to plot against him
and they weren't allowed to go

20:50.780 --> 20:53.980
back to their country seats, where
they could have fermented rebellion.

20:53.980 --> 20:58.140
It was all part of this strange
cult of the Sun King.

20:58.140 --> 21:01.900
It's as if Louis used his magnetism
to trap his nobles

21:01.900 --> 21:04.300
here in the gilded
cage of Versailles.

21:08.940 --> 21:12.340
Now Louis could get on with enjoying
the pleasures of life.

21:21.340 --> 21:25.340
And there was nothing
he enjoyed more than the ladies.

21:26.860 --> 21:31.340
He pursued one beauty after
another - married and single,

21:31.340 --> 21:33.580
highborn and low.

21:33.580 --> 21:38.660
Not for nothing was his time
in power known as the reign of love.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.940
Here are some of Louis'
leading ladies.

21:46.820 --> 21:53.260
Now, kings of France often had two
wives - one a wife for business.

21:53.260 --> 21:55.820
In Louis' case,
it was Maria Theresa of Spain.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.500
It was her job to represent
an alliance with another country

22:00.500 --> 22:04.340
and to give him
his official children or heirs.

22:04.340 --> 22:08.500
But then, he would have a
wife for fun - a mistress or,

22:08.500 --> 22:10.940
in Louis' case, mistresses.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.620
At any one moment, the chief of them

22:14.620 --> 22:19.060
was called the maitresse declaree -
the declared mistress.

22:19.060 --> 22:22.500
I think it's very French that she
had a sort of semi-official

22:22.500 --> 22:23.900
job title!

22:25.580 --> 22:29.860
Louise de La Valliere was Louis'
first maitresse declaree.

22:31.020 --> 22:33.660
The story of Louise de La Valliere

22:33.660 --> 22:35.940
is intertwined with the story of

22:35.940 --> 22:38.140
Versailles itself because Louis

22:38.140 --> 22:39.980
was falling in love with her

22:39.980 --> 22:42.100
at the same time as he was falling

22:42.100 --> 22:44.420
in love with the idea of his palace.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.100
They held trysts there

22:46.100 --> 22:48.260
and the magnificent party

22:48.260 --> 22:50.340
The Pleasures Of The Enchanted Isle

22:50.340 --> 22:52.380
was held to celebrate their love.

22:53.980 --> 22:58.700
Now, Louise's position as chief
mistress was far from secure.

22:58.700 --> 23:02.260
The other ladies of the court all
had their eye on Louis

23:02.260 --> 23:05.180
and he was all too susceptible.

23:05.180 --> 23:09.060
When Louise came onto the scene,
Louis was already having

23:09.060 --> 23:13.180
rather a scandalous relationship
with Henrietta of England.

23:13.180 --> 23:16.500
She was - wait for this -
his brother's wife

23:16.500 --> 23:18.380
and his own first cousin.

23:18.380 --> 23:19.780
Dodgy!

23:26.060 --> 23:27.340
Spring has sprung.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.460
And there were plenty of other
contenders vying for

23:35.460 --> 23:39.100
Louise de La Valliere's prized
role of chief mistress.

23:41.740 --> 23:44.580
Enter Athenais de Montespan.

23:46.060 --> 23:49.380
How many have you had?
I do not recall.

23:50.620 --> 23:53.300
In which case why would one
more make any difference?

23:55.420 --> 23:58.980
Hard to say without partaking.
Why is that?

24:00.220 --> 24:03.500
Surely, after a certain time,
it's just a number, is it not?

24:06.340 --> 24:07.940
That depends on the number.

24:10.660 --> 24:15.460
Athenais was devastatingly
intelligent and confident

24:15.460 --> 24:18.340
and pretty and manipulative.

24:18.340 --> 24:23.580
She made friends with Louise in
order to get close to the King.

24:23.580 --> 24:24.900
False friend.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.460
I am boring and you are funny.

24:29.460 --> 24:32.500
Perhaps, when he returns, you might
put him in a good mood for me -

24:32.500 --> 24:34.580
talk to him, make him laugh.

24:34.580 --> 24:38.380
If he's in a good humour,
I might just have a chance.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.620
Would you do that?
I suppose I could try.

24:48.340 --> 24:50.980
Now, Louis didn't stand a chance.

24:50.980 --> 24:53.860
He fell under the spell of Athenais.

24:53.860 --> 24:59.180
Very soon, he just had to make
love to her three times a day

24:59.180 --> 25:02.980
and he was so keen that he would
start to undress her,

25:02.980 --> 25:05.340
even before her ladies had
left the room.

25:06.860 --> 25:09.500
And she was equally enthusiastic.

25:09.500 --> 25:13.740
It was said that her powder
lit very easily.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.340
KISSING SOUNDS

25:20.660 --> 25:25.180
It wasn't long before Athenais
usurped her so-called friend,

25:25.180 --> 25:28.780
Louise,
and took her place at the top table.

25:43.780 --> 25:48.500
Athenais reigned supreme as official
mistress for the next decade.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.620
And it was during this
time that Louis

25:57.620 --> 26:02.900
fulfilled his dream of creating
a palace not just fit for any

26:02.900 --> 26:06.140
old king but fit for the Sun King.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.660
Now, the gardens on this side will
extend from here to here.

26:13.660 --> 26:17.340
Very good, sire. What is this large
rectangle here? A lake.

26:18.500 --> 26:23.220
You wish to put a lake in this area?
The area is the lake. That is...

26:23.220 --> 26:26.740
A big lake, yes. Sire...

26:26.740 --> 26:30.740
A lake that size would dwarf any
structure that looks out upon it.

26:30.740 --> 26:33.180
That depends on the structure,
does it not?

26:34.380 --> 26:38.940
Nothing could stand in the way
of Louis' grand plans.

26:38.940 --> 26:44.140
He drained swamps, moved forests
and diverted rivers to

26:44.140 --> 26:49.300
make way for the world's most
opulent royal playground.

26:49.300 --> 26:54.300
Its size and splendour trumpeted
Louis' wealth and power.

26:54.300 --> 26:58.380
But a project worthy of such
a prince required a workforce

26:58.380 --> 26:59.780
to match.

27:00.980 --> 27:04.020
The palace was under scaffolding
for years at a time

27:04.020 --> 27:06.980
and the gardens here looked pretty
much like a quarry.

27:06.980 --> 27:11.540
Up to 36,000 people were slaving
away here and they were

27:11.540 --> 27:15.420
labouring under conditions you could
only describe as horrendous.

27:17.580 --> 27:20.700
Builders toiled from dawn till dusk.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.940
A common bricklayer earned
five sous a day -

27:23.940 --> 27:26.580
about the cost of a tiny
piece of butter.

27:28.660 --> 27:33.100
Accidents was so frequent that three
hospitals were built to deal

27:33.100 --> 27:34.500
with the casualties.

27:35.540 --> 27:37.580
And even in his exalted position,

27:37.580 --> 27:41.820
Louis could not quite escape the
hardships that his workers endured.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.580
You say you are France.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.420
If you truly were,
you'd know our suffering,

27:53.420 --> 27:58.060
you'd feel it in your bones
and you'd take the pain away.

28:00.180 --> 28:03.420
Builders went on strike in a bid
to improve their lot.

28:06.180 --> 28:08.460
Their grievances are many, sire.

28:08.460 --> 28:11.700
Many suffer from injuries
sustained at their work

28:11.700 --> 28:13.020
but are as yet untreated.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.540
They claim that working
conditions are too harsh,

28:17.540 --> 28:21.260
not enough attention's paid
to their safety. Is this true?

28:21.260 --> 28:25.300
We lose half a dozen men per week,
Sire. Many more are injured.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.540
From the archives,

28:28.540 --> 28:32.580
I've dug out a document that gives
a real-life example of Louis

28:32.580 --> 28:36.260
being brought face-to-face with
the human cost of Versailles.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.940
In the summer of 1668, there was

28:40.940 --> 28:44.180
an accident involving
some of the heavy machinery in use

28:44.180 --> 28:47.860
at Versailles that's reported
here in the Gazette of Amsterdam.

28:47.860 --> 28:52.100
We're told that there was an
accident and some debris fell

28:52.100 --> 28:56.780
and underneath it were caught five
or six workmen, "ouvriers",

28:56.780 --> 28:58.980
who were "ecrases dessous".

28:58.980 --> 29:01.060
"Ecrases" - what does...
They were crushed.

29:01.060 --> 29:04.500
Crushed? Crushed underneath, crushed
to death. Five or six of them?

29:04.500 --> 29:05.580
My goodness.

29:05.580 --> 29:08.700
Five or six, and that's all we're
told - one sentence at this point.

29:08.700 --> 29:13.260
But we get a little bit more detail,
a few days later, when the King

29:13.260 --> 29:18.340
was confronted by the mother of one
of these poor dead workmen.

29:18.340 --> 29:22.740
She managed to get close enough
to ask the King

29:22.740 --> 29:25.620
if she could have the
body of her son back,

29:25.620 --> 29:28.860
the newspaper says, with many
insults directed at the King.

29:28.860 --> 29:32.540
Now, whether that's exaggeration
for journalistic effect

29:32.540 --> 29:34.740
or what the King felt had
happened...

29:34.740 --> 29:37.620
Do you think it was quite shocking
that she just got close enough

29:37.620 --> 29:38.900
and dared to speak to him?

29:38.900 --> 29:42.300
Absolutely, that someone of her
status should be able to speak

29:42.300 --> 29:47.060
directly to the King himself in
terms that were not complimentary.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.980
And it didn't go well for her.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.300
We're told that she was
put in prison,

29:51.300 --> 29:54.660
where she still is locked up,
the newspaper says.

29:54.660 --> 29:58.500
So, hang on - Louis' machine has
crushed to death this woman's son,

29:58.500 --> 30:02.140
she has asked for his dead body, and
for that, she's been put in prison?

30:02.140 --> 30:07.460
She has. The human cost of his great
enterprises is irrelevant to

30:07.460 --> 30:11.060
Louis in comparison
with his grand purposes.

30:11.060 --> 30:16.220
The question is to what extent this
is representative of something

30:16.220 --> 30:19.660
bigger, more characteristic
of Louis' rule as a whole.

30:19.660 --> 30:23.500
Well, I guess you could say, this is
an absolute monarch doing his job,

30:23.500 --> 30:25.540
the needs of the state must
come first,

30:25.540 --> 30:29.020
he has the power to override
the trivial needs of the individual.

30:29.020 --> 30:32.500
But it does seem to me
that there's something really cold

30:32.500 --> 30:35.780
and uniquely determined
about Louis himself.

30:39.140 --> 30:43.020
I will not be pushed into the sea
by a builder on a scaffold!

30:47.900 --> 30:51.620
Louis' determination
and his ruthlessness made him

30:51.620 --> 30:56.580
many enemies but he had ways of
keeping one step ahead

30:56.580 --> 30:58.980
of anyone who might
plot against him.

31:01.220 --> 31:04.340
You might think that surveillance is
a modern concept,

31:04.340 --> 31:07.980
but Louis, who was insecure to the
point of paranoia,

31:07.980 --> 31:09.980
kept a watchful eye on everyone.

31:13.780 --> 31:19.860
No-one understood better than Louis
that information was power.

31:21.220 --> 31:28.380
That is one of 948 journals gathered
by our services

31:28.380 --> 31:31.380
detailing every single member of
your court.

31:31.380 --> 31:35.220
Their height, weight,
hair and eye colour.

31:35.220 --> 31:37.860
Their daily movements, from your
valet...

31:39.300 --> 31:42.460
..to your cook's assistant,
Madeleine DuBois.

31:44.380 --> 31:48.220
And Louis even knew everyone's
innermost thoughts.

31:48.220 --> 31:49.660
How?

31:49.660 --> 31:54.700
Because all mail to and from
Versailles was intercepted.

31:54.700 --> 32:01.020
Historian James Daybell is
guiding me through the lost world of
17th-century espionage.

32:01.020 --> 32:05.140
This is so much more significant
and atmospheric

32:05.140 --> 32:08.420
than licking the flap, isn't it?
It is, it is.

32:08.420 --> 32:12.980
We really feel like this is
a special thing to do.

32:12.980 --> 32:16.260
Now, we're going to get our seal,
which is a fleur-de-lis.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.900
Peel it away slowly.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.500
Oh... And there we are.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.340
That's not bad. Very good.

32:23.340 --> 32:26.620
So if we got this letter in the
post, you would know that I had sent

32:26.620 --> 32:29.060
it? Yes. And that it hadn't been
tampered with?

32:29.060 --> 32:32.100
And that it hadn't been tampered
with, yes. Theoretically!

32:32.100 --> 32:34.140
So it's secure.

32:34.140 --> 32:35.980
But at the court of Versailles,

32:35.980 --> 32:40.860
we know that Louis's espionage
masters were reading the letters.

32:40.860 --> 32:43.460
How did they do that when they were
sealed up with wax?

32:43.460 --> 32:45.340
This is a dark art.

32:45.340 --> 32:50.020
We have an example of a letter
from a courtier close to the king

32:50.020 --> 32:53.460
in which she warns a German
cousin about this

32:53.460 --> 32:55.740
opening of letters and she writes,

32:55.740 --> 32:59.300
"Just because letters are poorly
sealed does not mean anything.

32:59.300 --> 33:02.700
"They have a material made of
mercury and other stuff that can be

33:02.700 --> 33:06.860
"pressed onto the seal, where it
takes on the shape of the seal.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.220
"After they've read
and copied letters,

33:09.220 --> 33:13.020
"they neatly reseal them and no-one
can see that they have been opened."

33:14.940 --> 33:18.700
So that method involves making a
replica of the original seal?

33:18.700 --> 33:22.460
Absolutely. And once you have that,
you're then able to open

33:22.460 --> 33:26.140
and reseal people's correspondence
all the time.

33:26.140 --> 33:27.980
That's pretty sneaky stuff.

33:27.980 --> 33:32.420
James, what happened to the
people whose mail was read, then,
contrary to their knowledge?

33:32.420 --> 33:38.260
Once he found that you were talking
in a critical tone about his court,

33:38.260 --> 33:41.980
his policies, his friendships,
you would be out of favour.

33:41.980 --> 33:46.180
And so many courtiers were
destroyed in this way.

33:46.180 --> 33:50.100
This surveillance state that he
develops in the 17th century

33:50.100 --> 33:55.380
is incredibly powerful and it's used
to keep tabs on the courtiers

33:55.380 --> 33:58.620
at the very heart of his power
base at Versailles.

34:02.700 --> 34:07.020
Disloyal courtiers wised up to
Louis's tactics

34:07.020 --> 34:10.060
and found other ways to convey their
messages.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.699
With all of this surveillance
going on,

34:17.699 --> 34:19.620
there was only one way to keep a
secret.

34:19.620 --> 34:21.980
You had to write it in cipher.

34:21.980 --> 34:23.820
(Secret code!)

34:27.699 --> 34:31.020
I have identified this
as a Cistercian Codex

34:31.020 --> 34:32.739
from the Low Countries.

34:32.739 --> 34:35.820
Very rare, almost forgotten.
Used, it appears,

34:35.820 --> 34:37.940
as an alternative to Roman numerals.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.100
So these are merely numbers?

34:41.100 --> 34:43.100
Which correspond to letters.

34:44.020 --> 34:47.540
But Louis beat the courtiers at
their own game by employing

34:47.540 --> 34:50.420
cryptographers to crack the codes.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.500
The first message is very simple.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
"Kill the men who bring this map."

34:57.060 --> 34:59.860
The second one is more intriguing.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.780
A riddle, in fact.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.900
"The end is near.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.140
"Make your peace with God."

35:18.220 --> 35:21.500
To make sure his own messages
remained secret,

35:21.500 --> 35:25.740
Louis engaged the services of
Antoine Rossignol.

35:27.380 --> 35:31.860
Rossignol was the greatest
cryptographer of the 17th century.

35:31.860 --> 35:35.340
He came up with a code that was
so complex, that after it

35:35.340 --> 35:39.380
fell out of regular use, it baffled
cryptographers for centuries.

35:40.580 --> 35:43.020
It was called the Great Cipher.

35:45.460 --> 35:49.540
All this secrecy sounds extreme,
but it worked.

35:51.020 --> 35:53.300
After all, Louis wasn't
assassinated.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.900
But the king's paranoia grew.

35:58.900 --> 36:04.140
In this world of fear and intrigue,
who could he rely on?

36:10.500 --> 36:14.900
As so often, Louis didn't put his
trust in the most powerful men in
the land,

36:14.900 --> 36:16.940
potential rivals all,

36:16.940 --> 36:20.180
but those with whom he spent
his most intimate hours.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.460
His chosen servants.

36:27.220 --> 36:31.180
And there was one servant who was
forever by Louis's side.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.660
His valet for over 40 years,

36:35.940 --> 36:38.580
Alexandre Bontemps.

36:38.580 --> 36:41.540
Bontemps was the first to see the
king in the morning,

36:41.540 --> 36:44.260
and the last to tuck him
up in bed at night.

36:44.260 --> 36:47.580
He was one of the few people allowed
to go through the gate in the

36:47.580 --> 36:53.300
golden balustrade into the king's
private area of the bedchamber.

36:53.300 --> 36:57.580
Bontemps himself slept just here,
on a camp bed.

36:57.580 --> 36:59.620
The first valet was the only person

36:59.620 --> 37:02.460
allowed to sleep in the king's
bedchamber.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.500
Not even the queen could do that.

37:04.500 --> 37:08.540
Constantly vigilant,
attentive to every need,

37:08.540 --> 37:11.020
he was like a faithful old hound.

37:13.020 --> 37:17.660
Sire, we received word the Parthenay
family will arrive this morning.

37:17.660 --> 37:21.540
Will my goddaughter, Charlotte,
be with them? Yes, Sire.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.180
A little ray of sunshine.

37:25.780 --> 37:29.260
Bontemps's devotion to Louis
dominated his life,

37:29.260 --> 37:32.100
almost to the exclusion of his
own family.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.140
When asked one day how his
wife was doing,

37:34.140 --> 37:37.180
he automatically replied,
"I'll ask the King."

37:39.700 --> 37:42.660
You have a woman? My wife lives
in Paris.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.100
With you? I live with the King.

37:45.100 --> 37:49.460
Now I am confused.
Wherever the King sleeps, I sleep.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.500
This is as far as I go.

37:54.660 --> 37:56.940
His bed must be very crowded.

37:58.540 --> 38:03.220
Bontemps knew everything about
the King's most private affairs.

38:03.220 --> 38:06.460
All personal correspondence went
through his hands,

38:06.460 --> 38:10.940
and he acted as a go-between
for Louis and his lovers.

38:10.940 --> 38:15.020
It was said that Bontemps was most
secret, most faithful

38:15.020 --> 38:18.500
and entirely devoted to the King.

38:18.500 --> 38:22.900
This was one of Louis's closest
relationships.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.540
Pull up a chair.

38:27.980 --> 38:30.820
I said a chair, not a stool.

38:30.820 --> 38:32.540
A chair with arms.

38:39.460 --> 38:43.340
Only a king may sit next to His
Majesty in a chair with arms.

38:43.340 --> 38:45.060
You are more than a king.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.100
You are my friend.

39:03.700 --> 39:07.820
So, could Louis XIV and his trusty
valet really have been friends?

39:07.820 --> 39:11.420
What do you think? Kings were
surrounded by servants all the time.

39:11.420 --> 39:15.300
There was huge intimacy there.
But real friendship?

39:15.300 --> 39:18.740
The difference in status made that
much more complicated.

39:18.740 --> 39:21.180
It does seem, though, that Louis
was more at ease

39:21.180 --> 39:24.020
with his retainers than
almost anyone else.

39:24.020 --> 39:26.500
Ah, and there is the evidence
of the Duke of Saint-Simon,

39:26.500 --> 39:30.420
who says that the King loved his
servants more than his own children.

39:32.340 --> 39:35.220
In return for his devoted service,

39:35.220 --> 39:40.260
Louis showered Bontemps with gifts
of land, titles and lucrative posts.

39:42.700 --> 39:45.540
Bontemps could even afford a
townhouse in Paris

39:45.540 --> 39:48.020
with his own staff of 12.

39:50.260 --> 39:53.340
Louis didn't just elevate
his personal servants, he made

39:53.340 --> 39:56.980
a point of promoting ministers
from more humble backgrounds.

39:56.980 --> 40:00.620
And his decision to promote them
at the expense of his nobles

40:00.620 --> 40:03.860
brought about a change in the way
that France was governed.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.500
It began what the resentful
Saint-Simon called

40:06.500 --> 40:08.900
"the reign of the vile bourgeoisie".

40:12.580 --> 40:16.740
Louis transformed life at court
down to the smallest detail.

40:18.260 --> 40:21.900
He even changed what people wore.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.980
From the hats on their heads
to the shoes on their feet.

40:28.300 --> 40:33.100
Louis's own love of drama and
splendour was reflected in HIS
wardrobe.

40:44.660 --> 40:48.780
This was power dressing...
Louis XIV style.

40:50.940 --> 40:53.060
I must tell you all,

40:53.060 --> 40:56.700
I believe that very soon we shall
have a revolution in our country.

40:58.780 --> 41:02.220
The world knows France to be
a master of the battlefield.

41:02.220 --> 41:06.460
But one glimpse around this glorious
place will tell you, soon it will be

41:06.460 --> 41:10.900
our textile mercers and our master
tailors who shall transform the
world.

41:10.900 --> 41:15.220
Our fashions will be revered
just as much for their beauty,

41:15.220 --> 41:19.620
elegance, refinement and grace.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.620
The finest in the world.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.660
APPLAUSE

41:23.660 --> 41:28.340
To achieve his ends, Louis
introduced a strict new dress code.

41:29.820 --> 41:34.620
We are trying it on for size
with the help of costume historian
Mark Wallis.

41:36.900 --> 41:40.780
How did Louis make his courtiers
look the way he wanted them to?

41:40.780 --> 41:42.180
By the royal edict,

41:42.180 --> 41:44.900
you could not wear anything not
made of French manufacturer.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.700
If you were caught wearing something
made from a different country,

41:47.700 --> 41:50.500
it would be taken off and burnt.
And fined of course, too.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.740
He did something that never had
happened before,

41:52.740 --> 41:56.300
which was to invent a court uniform
called the justaucorps a brevet.

41:56.300 --> 41:59.220
Now, these coats are entirely new.

41:59.220 --> 42:02.860
Made of blue cloth, covered in gold
and silver, lined with red.

42:02.860 --> 42:06.180
Only 50 men, the King,
the royal dukes, the princes etc,

42:06.180 --> 42:08.180
were allowed to wear this coat.

42:08.180 --> 42:10.220
That really showed you
were in with the in crowd.

42:10.220 --> 42:12.900
And if you died, your coat would be
handed on to the next person

42:12.900 --> 42:16.980
considered suitable enough to wear
it. So he's using the carrot and the
stick.

42:16.980 --> 42:20.220
They want to look like they're part
of the club, they want to look good.

42:20.220 --> 42:22.500
And if they break the rules,
they get fined. Yes.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.420
And of course, it suited Louis's
ego. The more splendid his court

42:25.420 --> 42:26.860
looked, the better he looked.

42:26.860 --> 42:29.100
And was the envy of all
Christian princes.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.940
Thanks to Louis, France became
the capital of haute couture,

42:33.940 --> 42:36.980
something it's remained to this day.

42:36.980 --> 42:40.260
And Louis found that forcing
his courtiers to follow fashion

42:40.260 --> 42:42.180
had other advantages.

42:45.940 --> 42:48.780
So how much of an investment would
an outfit like this have been?

42:48.780 --> 42:51.460
So you have around your collar this
bertha, as it's known.

42:51.460 --> 42:54.860
This would be the equivalent,
around your shoulders, of perhaps

42:54.860 --> 42:57.740
a very expensive sports car.
Perhaps even a yacht.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.940
You also have lace upon your gown,
down the front

42:59.940 --> 43:01.820
and all around the hem of the skirt.

43:01.820 --> 43:05.060
Again, just to show your wealth,
or your husband's wealth,

43:05.060 --> 43:06.500
and your extravagance.

43:06.500 --> 43:10.300
Now, turning to Lucy, again with
your coat made of silk, and of

43:10.300 --> 43:15.100
course the gold galloon running down
the front, vertically on your coat.

43:15.100 --> 43:16.500
The wonderful detail.

43:16.500 --> 43:19.060
Lots of buttons, made in France, of
gold.

43:19.060 --> 43:21.300
So, really, everything is the best.

43:21.300 --> 43:24.220
Yet you've got to afford not just
one outfit, you had to have

43:24.220 --> 43:26.980
lots of different outfits for lots
of different occasions.

43:26.980 --> 43:28.780
All of which cost a fortune.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.300
This one is nice.

43:37.300 --> 43:40.180
We'll need more than just a dress,
a filigree bracelet

43:40.180 --> 43:42.620
and a necklace of diamonds,
believe me.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.780
But how will we pay? Oh!

43:45.780 --> 43:47.500
Let me worry about that.

43:50.540 --> 43:52.500
What happened
if they couldn't afford it?

43:52.500 --> 43:54.620
It was so expensive, it would
bankrupt people.

43:54.620 --> 43:57.260
So you'd borrow from the King,
at a certain interest level,

43:57.260 --> 44:00.020
and that gets you deeper in. You're
in a royal circle of debt.

44:00.020 --> 44:01.540
It's incredible how he managed it.

44:01.540 --> 44:03.740
Like a spider in the great
golden web.

44:07.380 --> 44:11.860
It was typically clever of Louis
to use fashion to show off his

44:11.860 --> 44:16.660
courtiers' wealth, while at the same
time stripping it away from them.

44:16.660 --> 44:20.220
As one marquis said, "No-one at
Versailles was really rich

44:20.220 --> 44:23.620
"because they'd spent their fortunes
on all this."

44:33.780 --> 44:37.460
The ruthless side of Louis's
nature was also evident

44:37.460 --> 44:41.740
in his treatment of his closest
relative - his brother, Philippe.

44:43.340 --> 44:46.380
Now, give it to me. I knew it,
the minute you get the chance,

44:46.380 --> 44:49.380
you belittle me again.

44:49.380 --> 44:53.100
Brother. The magic word,
what is it?

44:53.100 --> 44:54.940
Do not forget who addresses you.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.380
You never were good at sharing.

45:10.180 --> 45:13.620
Throughout history,
the relationship between a king

45:13.620 --> 45:16.140
and his younger brother has been
tricky.

45:16.140 --> 45:20.580
It's no fun being the spare
when you want to be the heir.

45:20.580 --> 45:22.540
And the relationship between Louis

45:22.540 --> 45:25.700
and HIS younger brother was
understandably tense.

45:39.020 --> 45:42.060
Do you think it's hard
to be a king?

45:42.060 --> 45:44.060
Try being a king's
brother for a day.

45:46.100 --> 45:50.180
The differences between Louis
and Philippe were clear

45:50.180 --> 45:51.460
from very early on.

45:52.820 --> 45:54.860
Here's Louis as a little boy,

45:54.860 --> 45:57.500
and he's already dressed as
a little king,

45:57.500 --> 45:59.580
in his beautiful leather boots,

45:59.580 --> 46:03.980
his red breeches with gold fringing,
his hat with the white plume.

46:05.380 --> 46:08.900
And, at first glance, you might
assume this is his sister.

46:08.900 --> 46:12.740
He looks like a girl with pink
cheeks and wearing a dress,

46:12.740 --> 46:17.180
but actually it's Louis's younger
brother, Philippe.

46:17.180 --> 46:19.220
Now, don't read too much into this.

46:19.220 --> 46:22.140
Little boys in the 17th century
were put in dresses

46:22.140 --> 46:25.500
until they were old enough to be
breeched at the age of seven,

46:25.500 --> 46:28.340
put into a man's clothing or
breeches.

46:28.340 --> 46:31.980
But in this case, the boy's mother
was determined that Philippe

46:31.980 --> 46:34.860
should never present
a threat to Louis.

46:34.860 --> 46:38.220
To this end,
she nurtured his feminine side.

46:38.220 --> 46:42.300
She called him "my little girl",
and she always encouraged him

46:42.300 --> 46:43.580
to wear dresses.

46:44.820 --> 46:48.060
This had a lasting
impact on Philippe.

46:48.060 --> 46:49.620
Philippe, Duc d'Orleans.

46:53.540 --> 46:57.620
As an adult, Philippe sometimes
chose to dress up as a woman,

46:57.620 --> 47:00.020
and he loved ladies clothing.

47:03.260 --> 47:08.420
One court chronicler said that he
was always decked out like a woman,

47:08.420 --> 47:13.380
"covered everywhere with rings,
bracelets and jewels, with a long
black wig.

47:13.380 --> 47:17.940
"He also wore such high heels that
he looked like he was wearing
stilts."

47:17.940 --> 47:21.580
So good of you to come. A pleasure.

47:21.580 --> 47:24.220
You spent 50,000 on shoes.

47:26.460 --> 47:29.140
Well, you haven't seen the shoes.

47:30.740 --> 47:32.940
Madame de La Fayette said that

47:32.940 --> 47:38.620
"the miracle of inflaming the heart
of this prince was not
reserved for any woman."

47:40.900 --> 47:44.060
Philippe was married to
Henrietta of England,

47:44.060 --> 47:48.380
but his true love was the Chevalier
de Lorraine.

47:48.380 --> 47:53.260
A handsome, blond-haired
nobleman of princely rank.

47:53.260 --> 47:57.340
He lived with Philippe, and was
a sort of male official mistress.

48:00.180 --> 48:02.300
It was a crowded marriage.

48:06.060 --> 48:09.100
Philippe flaunted his femininity.

48:09.100 --> 48:11.940
Everybody knew that he had male
lovers.

48:11.940 --> 48:15.100
On the one hand, this was
an embarrassment to Louis, but on

48:15.100 --> 48:19.420
the other, it meant that Philippe
served as a foil to the King.

48:19.420 --> 48:22.540
They were two halves of a whole,
a perfect double act.

48:22.540 --> 48:24.540
Philippe's lack of manliness

48:24.540 --> 48:28.700
only served to emphasise
Louis's masculinity.

48:28.700 --> 48:30.660
But, as it turned out,

48:30.660 --> 48:34.500
and perhaps surprisingly for a man
who loved shoes so much,

48:34.500 --> 48:38.460
Philippe would upstage his brother
in one crucial area.

48:39.980 --> 48:43.780
Philippe dreamed of being a soldier.

48:45.220 --> 48:48.940
In the 1670s,
when France was at war with Holland,

48:48.940 --> 48:51.980
he demanded to join the action.

48:51.980 --> 48:53.100
Bontemps.

48:55.140 --> 48:58.100
I have a sword, armour and a horse.

48:58.100 --> 49:00.820
Why the delay?
When will I go to war?

49:00.820 --> 49:05.180
The King has not yet set a date.
What am I supposed to do until then?

49:09.020 --> 49:12.700
In the spring of 1677,
the French launched a rapid

49:12.700 --> 49:15.780
attack on enemy-held towns
in northern France.

49:20.980 --> 49:23.660
Philippe was finally
posted to the front line.

49:29.540 --> 49:32.020
At the Battle of Cassel,
he commanded the troops

49:32.020 --> 49:34.700
and personally led the charge.

49:37.900 --> 49:40.020
BATTLE CRIES

49:44.980 --> 49:47.860
Eyewitnesses said that
he charged like a grenadier.

49:47.860 --> 49:50.660
Philippe fought so bravely
that his troops were inspired to

49:50.660 --> 49:52.100
perform miracles.

49:59.020 --> 50:02.260
The result? A complete victory
against the Dutch.

50:05.740 --> 50:08.660
Afterwards, on the road back to
Paris, people shouted,

50:08.660 --> 50:12.420
"Long live the King, and Monsieur,
who won the battle!"

50:12.420 --> 50:14.460
Louis didn't like the sound of that.

50:15.820 --> 50:17.700
CHEERING

50:26.660 --> 50:30.260
Louis made sure that when
the Battle of Cassel was painted,

50:30.260 --> 50:32.940
it represented his version
of events.

50:35.180 --> 50:39.340
In this glorious painting,
the battle rages, a gun is fired,

50:39.340 --> 50:41.500
and a soldier falls.

50:41.500 --> 50:43.900
And here,
in the thick of the fighting,

50:43.900 --> 50:47.260
is the king on his warhorse
in his white-plumed hat.

50:48.860 --> 50:52.460
But in life, not art,
Louis wasn't even there.

50:52.460 --> 50:55.660
The hero of the hour was Philippe.
And where's he?

50:57.180 --> 51:00.540
Here, stuck in the corner,
in his brother's shadow.

51:04.020 --> 51:08.180
Seen nursing a bump on the head
at Versailles, Louis receives word

51:08.180 --> 51:09.620
of his brother's victory.

51:11.140 --> 51:13.980
"We report with joy
the success of the king's

51:13.980 --> 51:17.580
"infantry against the troops
of the Spanish.

51:17.580 --> 51:20.340
"Siege is now laid to the town
of Cambrai."

51:20.340 --> 51:23.100
At last, some good news.

51:23.100 --> 51:26.940
"Most remarkable of all heroes
present in the king's name,

51:26.940 --> 51:30.220
"is His Majesty's own brother,
Prince Philippe,

51:30.220 --> 51:34.540
"the Duke of Orleans, who has shown
bravery on the battlefield..."

51:34.540 --> 51:38.980
That's enough news for now.
"A true and everlasting hero..."

51:38.980 --> 51:40.780
I said enough!

51:40.780 --> 51:43.020
And so it was in real life.

51:43.020 --> 51:46.060
Louis was so jealous of his little
brother's achievement

51:46.060 --> 51:49.100
that he never again put him
in charge of an army.

51:49.100 --> 51:51.140
No-one could outshine the Sun King.

51:54.220 --> 51:58.060
If Louis was the sun,
Philippe was the moon,

51:58.060 --> 52:01.580
only allowed to shine
in his brother's reflected glory.

52:13.700 --> 52:19.260
At Versailles, everyone
revolved around the Sun King.

52:19.260 --> 52:21.620
Louis officially moved
the seat of government

52:21.620 --> 52:24.980
and installed his court
here in 1684.

52:26.260 --> 52:29.140
And for the remaining
30 years of his reign,

52:29.140 --> 52:32.780
he only returned to Paris
eight times.

52:32.780 --> 52:35.420
It was a staggering
transformation in the way

52:35.420 --> 52:38.060
the French monarchy ruled.

52:38.060 --> 52:41.060
Louis had created
the ultimate power base,

52:41.060 --> 52:45.820
5,000 souls living firmly
underneath the royal thumb.

52:47.900 --> 52:51.980
It's tempting to see all this crazy
ritual and extravagance

52:51.980 --> 52:57.140
as just another example of absolute
power corrupting absolutely.

52:57.140 --> 53:00.820
You'd think that this
combination of luxury and cruelty

53:00.820 --> 53:03.260
would lead to violent collapse.

53:03.260 --> 53:05.580
But in Louis' case, it didn't.

53:05.580 --> 53:09.100
The country was no longer torn
apart by feuding nobles,

53:09.100 --> 53:13.340
and France became renowned for
its culture and sophistication.

53:13.340 --> 53:15.860
On his deathbed, Louis pronounced,

53:15.860 --> 53:20.060
"I depart,
but the state will always remain."

53:20.060 --> 53:23.220
Well, remain it did,
at least for a while.

53:23.220 --> 53:27.860
And what will surely always remain,
is Louis' Palace of Versailles.
