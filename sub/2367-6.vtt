WEBVTT

00:14.682 --> 00:17.601
[distorted tone] Don't you move!

00:20.270 --> 00:22.480
Don't you freakin' move!

00:23.440 --> 00:25.317
[normal tone] Interlock your fingers
behind your head...

00:25.400 --> 00:26.902
and get on your knees.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.988
On your knees!
Do it! Do it now!

00:30.656 --> 00:33.701
Don't you move.
I'll put a bullet in you!

00:33.784 --> 00:37.580
[police officer 2] Last chance, asshole!
I will not hesitate to put you down!

00:37.663 --> 00:39.122
On your knees, do it!

00:39.206 --> 00:40.290
[police officer 3]
Keep your eyes on him.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.335
[police officer 1]
All right. Nice and slow.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.007
-You got him?
-[police officer 3] Yeah, yeah.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.425
Cuff the son of a bitch.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.893
What about this asshole?

00:59.977 --> 01:02.354
Take care of him like we were told.
No witnesses.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.982
[grunting]

01:11.071 --> 01:12.948
-[gunshot]
-Ahhh!

01:17.828 --> 01:19.037
[groaning]

01:22.040 --> 01:23.626
[groans]

01:24.376 --> 01:25.628
How bad are you hurt?

01:25.711 --> 01:28.046
[speaking Russian]

01:30.924 --> 01:32.050
[panting]

01:34.720 --> 01:36.639
[sirens wailing]

01:40.934 --> 01:41.935
[spits]

01:55.532 --> 01:57.492
[groaning]

01:58.744 --> 02:00.078
[Sergei speaking Russian]

02:01.246 --> 02:02.539
[grunts]

02:09.171 --> 02:13.091
Central! 15 Eddie!
Shots fired! Shots fired!

02:13.175 --> 02:15.177
Two suspects on foot!

02:15.260 --> 02:17.262
[theme music playing]

03:59.823 --> 04:01.825
[people clamoring]

04:03.410 --> 04:06.413
-What's going on?
-All right, listen up, everybody!

04:06.496 --> 04:10.292
We have reports coming in of multiple
explosions all across Hell's Kitchen.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.461
-Hey, Henricks, call PD, get a statement.
-Yeah.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.964
Taylor, reach out to your guy
at public works

04:16.048 --> 04:17.758
and see if gas or methane
had anything to do with this.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.176
What are the locations?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.552
You see me talking here, Urich?

04:20.635 --> 04:23.972
I'm just saying, it'd help if we knew
where we were going to cover this.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.933
Caldwell, give me that list.
Where are you?

04:26.016 --> 04:27.517
Please. Come on, come on.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.438
All right, locations are as follows,

04:31.521 --> 04:38.361
44th and 11th, 48th and 9th,
47th and 12th, 42nd and 10th.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.989
-It's not gas.
-How do you know that?

04:41.073 --> 04:43.116
Places that were hit,
all controlled by the Russians.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.243
Ben! Ben!

04:47.830 --> 04:49.497
[tires squealing]

04:51.124 --> 04:52.750
[sirens wailing]

04:54.419 --> 04:56.046
[tires squealing]

05:03.720 --> 05:04.805
Yes.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.515
Yes, it is.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.685
I'll let him know.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.773
-Vladimir is in the wind.
-How?

05:15.858 --> 05:19.444
Our friend in the black mask,
he was beating on him,

05:19.527 --> 05:22.614
but stopped Officer Corbin
and his boys from finishing him off.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.616
Then he wasn't trying to kill Vladimir.

05:24.699 --> 05:28.120
Based on what we know,
probably trying to get him to talk...

05:28.203 --> 05:30.205
-about you.
-[sighs]

05:30.288 --> 05:32.958
Blake was clumsy,
letting the mask get his phone.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.377
I had just texted him
the addresses for the sweep.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.670
We'll deal with Blake later.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.799
We need to contain this.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.844
Vladimir and the mask
won't make it out of the area.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.138
The sweep will pick them up.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.682
Gao put her trust in me.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.769
She gave me her help.

05:54.062 --> 05:58.942
She's going to be disappointed
the situation hasn't... concluded...

06:00.068 --> 06:02.195
as neatly as promised.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.488
What are you gonna tell her?

06:03.571 --> 06:06.866
The truth.
Lying to that woman is impossible.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.244
She'll want to know what our next move is.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.871
Letting the police do their jobs.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.709
That's what I pay them for, isn't it?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.795
-[cop] There's scumbags in the corridor.
-[indistinct police radio chatter]

06:18.878 --> 06:20.422
[Blake] We got two more over there.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.592
You go check on them, okay?

06:24.676 --> 06:25.677
-Every one.
-[cop] Yeah.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.141
-[breathing heavily]
-We got something here.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.352
[speaking Russian]

06:34.436 --> 06:36.271
[coughing]

06:39.107 --> 06:41.026
[resumes speaking Russian]

06:44.904 --> 06:47.490
-He don't look so bad.
-Yeah, all things considered.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.576
[speaking Russian]

06:49.659 --> 06:50.785
[coughs]

06:54.664 --> 06:57.750
Swear to God,
that asshole knew I was a righty.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.588
[speaking Russian]

07:01.671 --> 07:03.548
[screaming]

07:03.631 --> 07:05.008
[Blake] Oh, that hurts?

07:05.092 --> 07:06.426
English!

07:06.509 --> 07:07.635
Where's Vladimir?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.387
I don't know! [groans]

07:09.471 --> 07:10.888
[screaming]

07:12.682 --> 07:15.060
Where would he go, huh,
if he didn't want to be found?

07:15.143 --> 07:18.105
-He's got a girl somewhere maybe?
-I don't know.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.522
[screaming]

07:19.606 --> 07:21.858
I don't know! [whimpering]

07:21.942 --> 07:24.236
I swear! I swear, please, please...

07:24.987 --> 07:26.113
Stop!

07:26.821 --> 07:28.949
Yeah, yeah, all right.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.127
You find anyone alive,
shoot 'em in the head.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.836
[police officer 1] Got it.
[police officer 2] Roger that.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.047
[siren approaching]

07:47.342 --> 07:49.302
[panting]

08:08.488 --> 08:10.032
[water dripping]

08:19.874 --> 08:21.418
[moaning]

08:24.879 --> 08:25.963
[Masked Man] Don't move.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.882
You've been shot.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.468
[speaking Russian]

08:30.552 --> 08:33.388
That sounds pretty bad,
but I don't speak asshole.

08:33.471 --> 08:37.559
I'm going to kill you
for taking my brother's head.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.353
You got the wrong guy.
I don't kill people.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.605
Not even scumbags like you
who deserve it.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.107
[Vladimir chuckles]

08:44.191 --> 08:46.526
You dropped Semyon off roof.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.528
Put him in coma.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.656
Yeah... but he was
still breathing, wasn't he?

08:51.739 --> 08:52.907
Your mask.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.330
I found it...
and what was left of my brother.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.956
-I didn't kill your brother.
-Lie!

09:00.040 --> 09:02.500
You think I'm the one
that blew your operation to shit, too?

09:02.584 --> 09:05.378
You're being played... by Fisk.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.381
The man you work for.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.925
Look, I don't know what you've been told,
but it's more of Fisk's games.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.677
He's trying to put you in the ground.
I'm not.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.928
Choose a side.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.265
I choose my own.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.891
Not an option.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.685
Fisk made sure of that.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.855
What do you want?

09:24.481 --> 09:25.648
Fisk...

09:26.441 --> 09:28.235
on trial for everything he's done.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.112
[chuckles weakly]

09:30.195 --> 09:31.738
[coughs]

09:31.821 --> 09:34.324
Then you're a fool. [moans]

09:36.576 --> 09:37.744
[Masked Man] Yeah.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.457
And you're bleeding out, so...
here we are.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.627
And if I believe you...

09:47.420 --> 09:50.006
and give you what you want to know...

09:51.383 --> 09:53.593
what do I get out of it?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.763
Payback.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.807
I have counterproposal.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.606
Suck my dick.

10:07.899 --> 10:08.900
[Vladimir sighs]

10:11.736 --> 10:12.987
[whispers] Vladimir...

10:13.070 --> 10:14.281
Vladimir...

10:14.364 --> 10:15.448
[slapping]

10:15.532 --> 10:18.868
Though no one's made official statements
about the nature of the explosions,

10:18.951 --> 10:22.414
the NYPD is urging everyone to stay inside

10:22.497 --> 10:24.749
until authorities are clear
on the nature of--

10:24.832 --> 10:26.501
We need help!

10:26.584 --> 10:28.336
Hey! Hey!

10:28.420 --> 10:30.588
I got an elderly woman over here
and she's bleeding bad!

10:30.672 --> 10:32.132
-Where's she hurt?
-[Karen] Are you a nurse?

10:32.215 --> 10:33.216
Yeah.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.260
Pretty bad laceration.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.512
[both speaking Spanish]

10:37.595 --> 10:39.556
-What's her name?
-[Foggy] Mrs. Cardenas. Elena.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.559
[Claire speaking Spanish]

10:46.146 --> 10:47.480
We'll wait here for you, Mrs. C!

10:47.564 --> 10:49.191
[speaks broken Spanish]

10:51.234 --> 10:52.735
She's gonna...
She's gonna be fine.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.946
-I'm just glad we were with her.
-Yeah.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.448
Early reports from the city--

10:56.531 --> 10:59.826
[Foggy] Jesus, look at this.
It's like a war zone out there.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.412
We better call Matt
and make sure he's okay.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.496
Yeah.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.165
Foggy, you're bleeding.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.374
Huh?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.043
Oh, that explains it.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.379
-Explains what?
-The stabbing pain in my side.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.547
-Foggy!
-[grunts]

11:12.630 --> 11:14.716
-[moaning]
-Sit.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.011
Here, just stay here. I'm gonna go
and try to find somebody, okay?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.806
-I'll just, uh... yeah.
-[mutters] Shit, what happened?

11:23.225 --> 11:27.437
Let's get these people triaged and coded,
and get Central on the line.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.274
We need to reroute incoming casualties
to Mercy or St. Mary's.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.694
What are you doing here?

11:34.777 --> 11:37.822
I heard you were in a car accident.
And since when do you drive?

11:37.905 --> 11:41.326
-[sighs] I made a very bad decision.
-That's my whole life.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.827
Good to have you back.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.580
-Anybody see Shapiro? Shapiro?
-[cell phone ringing]

11:48.333 --> 11:49.417
[sighing]

11:49.501 --> 11:52.211
Please tell me all this isn't you
dealing with the Russians.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.463
[chuckles]

11:53.546 --> 11:56.549
Wasn't me, but I don't think
you have to worry about them anymore.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.217
You call just to tell me that?

11:58.301 --> 12:00.219
No, I need your help.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.138
I found someone who has intel
on what I've been looking for,

12:02.221 --> 12:03.390
but he's been shot.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.433
So call 911.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.478
Can't. Police are the ones that shot him.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.855
Thinking they'd like a crack
at finishing the job.

12:10.938 --> 12:14.442
[sighing] You want me to come out
to you... in all this?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.944
No, I want you to
walk me through stabilizing him.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.866
It's not as easy
as it looks in the movies, you know?

12:21.949 --> 12:23.368
I don't really go to the movies.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.538
I like records, though.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.247
[sighs] All right.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.292
There's something else you need to know.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.919
The man I'm trying to save...

12:33.002 --> 12:34.086
it's Vladimir.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.006
The shithead that had me beat up?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.466
That's who you want me to help?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.259
Look, you have every right
to tell me to go to hell,

12:40.343 --> 12:41.469
but he's important, Claire.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.887
What he knows could bring Fisk down

12:42.970 --> 12:44.639
and save more people like you
from getting hurt.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.564
Claire?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.192
-Is there an exit wound?
-Thank you.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.485
[clears throat]

12:57.569 --> 12:58.611
Uh, no.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.698
The bullet's still inside him.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.200
It's still half a degree hotter
than the surrounding tissue.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.160
Is there any kind of first aid kit?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.455
I'm in a warehouse. Abandoned.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.083
Tell me what's there,
anything you can use.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.293
All right, hang on.

13:17.547 --> 13:21.217
Uh, half a box of nails... broken glass...

13:23.302 --> 13:26.180
uh, wood, duct tape,
old roadside emergency kit,

13:26.263 --> 13:29.351
-lot of plastic sheeting--
-The kit, are there any flares in it?

13:29.434 --> 13:30.768
Yeah, two.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.899
All right... you're gonna
cauterize the wound.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.401
Shouldn't I dig the bullet out first?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.445
Remember what I said
about this not being a movie?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.905
You cut him open and start digging around,
you'll kill him.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.742
This way at least
he has a chance of not bleeding out

13:45.825 --> 13:48.119
before you get what you need
out of him and...

13:48.202 --> 13:50.497
it'll hurt like a son of a bitch,
so bonus.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.206
All right, how do I do this?

13:52.289 --> 13:53.375
[Claire sighs]

13:53.458 --> 13:57.879
Just light the flare, hold it close
to his skin until the entry wound seals.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.465
Okay, I'm gonna put you on speaker.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.846
[grunts]

14:10.725 --> 14:12.143
All right, I got it.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.854
Don't let up...
no matter how much he screams.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.064
Professional advice or personal?

14:17.148 --> 14:18.983
Little of both.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.528
All right, cauterizing the wound.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.238
[screaming]

14:25.532 --> 14:27.033
[muffled screaming]

14:35.583 --> 14:37.293
[Vladimir screams]

14:45.802 --> 14:46.803
[muffled screaming]

14:50.598 --> 14:52.224
[Claire] Did it stop the bleeding?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.994
-Thanks, Claire. I gotta go.
-Matt?

15:12.078 --> 15:14.914
Central, Post 41. Pick up of a 10-10.

15:14.997 --> 15:19.043
Northwest corner of 4-7 and 12.
Abandoned building. Gimme an 85.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.254
[dispatcher] 10-4, Post 41.
Additional en route.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.133
Show me your hands!

16:10.136 --> 16:12.096
Show me your hands, now!

16:14.265 --> 16:15.892
He can't hear you.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.059
[grunting]

16:19.771 --> 16:21.105
[choking]

16:21.188 --> 16:23.232
I'm gonna take my knee off your throat.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.610
Stay quiet, answer my questions,

16:25.693 --> 16:28.655
or your night's gonna get
a hell of a lot worse.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.031
Understand?

16:32.742 --> 16:34.536
[wheezing]

16:36.328 --> 16:37.539
Who do you work for?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.332
The City of New York.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.670
I'm gonna ask you again.
Think about your answer.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.508
Who do you work for?

16:48.591 --> 16:51.678
The City of New York.
I got two months on the job.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.805
[heart beating steadily]

17:03.731 --> 17:04.899
Call Central.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.069
Tell them it was a false alarm.
No need to send backup.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.114
I do that... you let me walk?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.241
Eventually.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.418
Central, Post 41 K.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.253
[dispatcher] 10-4, Post 41.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.801
Second floor!
Perp in mask! Wounded civilian--

17:31.884 --> 17:34.846
[dispatcher] 10-4, Post 41. 10-13, 10-13.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.890
Abandoned building,
47th and 12th, second floor.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.893
[Pinski] Roger that. Adam responding.
[Blake] Fifteenth Squad en route.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.896
[sighs]

17:43.980 --> 17:45.565
[tires squealing]

17:45.648 --> 17:47.316
[sirens wailing]

18:06.543 --> 18:08.713
Where's Sullivan?
Anybody got eyes?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.131
Take it down, Pinski.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.424
Me and Hoffman are HNT on this.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.426
Secure the perimeter
and try not to piss yourself.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.972
We gotta do this right.
This is a hostage job.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.975
Nobody goes in and nobody comes out.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.143
Let's go. Move.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.270
[officers speaking indistinctly]

18:25.605 --> 18:27.774
You think he's in there?

18:27.857 --> 18:30.276
Sullivan told Central
it was a "masked perp."

18:30.359 --> 18:33.112
Russian was with the dickhead
last we heard, so yeah,

18:33.195 --> 18:34.530
I'm thinking he's the wounded civvie.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.283
-All right, I'll make the call.
-[officer] Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.701
-Christ.
-Where do you think you're going?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.286
Let's see some ID.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.747
All right, all right. Go ahead.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.290
Detectives!

18:44.999 --> 18:46.583
Thought IAB'd have you riding a desk,

18:46.668 --> 18:48.419
after that thing with the Russians
at the station.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.047
You see what's going on here?
Nobody's riding a desk tonight.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.674
-Can I get a statement?
-Yeah.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.176
The world's a shitty place.
You can quote me.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.761
Where's ESU?

18:56.844 --> 18:59.263
Had their hands full
with that building that went up.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.432
Carl, don't talk to him.
What's the matter with you?

19:01.515 --> 19:03.309
What about the cop in there?

19:03.392 --> 19:06.020
Officer, uh... Sullivan?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.521
How the hell you know that?

19:08.230 --> 19:09.481
How long I been doing this?

19:09.565 --> 19:10.942
Long enough to be a pain in the ass.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.402
Just doing my job.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.572
And we're doing ours...
so stay back and out of the way.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.034
You know, this thing goes sideways,
I can't promise you don't get caught up.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.662
Thanks.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.956
I'll keep my head down.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.708
Yeah, you do that.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.048
I'll let him know.
Wait for instruction.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.683
The man in the mask has turned up.

19:43.766 --> 19:47.770
Assaulting a cop
in an abandoned building on 12th.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.063
One of ours?

19:49.146 --> 19:52.274
No, some kid fresh out of the academy.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.652
-What about Vladimir?
-Holed up with the mask.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.948
Blake and Hoffman
have assumed HNT on scene,

19:59.031 --> 20:00.366
secured the perimeter,

20:00.449 --> 20:02.534
waiting for the go-ahead
to take the building.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.870
Give it.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.664
I wanna get this behind us.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.834
There's a complication.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.628
A reporter from the Bulletin.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.171
Turn his head.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.175
It's Ben Urich.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.013
The Union Allied article.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.599
If he picks up on anything
doesn't smell right...

20:25.682 --> 20:27.101
it could be a problem.

20:28.102 --> 20:33.399
Problems are just opportunities
that haven't presented themselves.

20:34.691 --> 20:38.780
You reach out
to all of our contacts in the media.

20:41.115 --> 20:45.161
I want everyone in Hell's Kitchen
to see what's about to happen.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.371
[all speaking indistinctly]

20:47.454 --> 20:49.165
-[sirens wailing]
-[police radio chattering]

21:02.511 --> 21:04.430
You've been busy.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.308
The building's surrounded.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.686
Ten officers... four dogs.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.479
More coming.

21:12.563 --> 21:15.566
-How do you know this?
-Lucky guess.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.692
[helicopter blades whirring]

21:20.237 --> 21:23.615
-We could have used that.
-I'm not big on guns.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.955
Great.
Little stick, much better.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.122
[Vladimir grunts]

21:30.206 --> 21:31.457
[Vladimir speaking Russian]

21:31.540 --> 21:34.376
-What did you do to me?
-Road flare.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.753
Cauterized the wound.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.590
You... burned me?

21:39.673 --> 21:41.550
Yeah, I had to stop the bleeding.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.094
[Vladimir] No!

21:43.177 --> 21:44.303
[screams]

21:45.304 --> 21:46.430
[groaning]

21:47.890 --> 21:51.477
Bullet's still inside you.
Wouldn't move around, if I were you.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.730
You expect me to say thank you?

21:54.814 --> 21:57.859
If I didn't need you alive,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.610
[chuckling weakly]

22:00.903 --> 22:02.029
[coughs]

22:03.489 --> 22:05.741
So you just stand there
and let me die, huh?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.785
But you couldn't kill me yourself.

22:08.870 --> 22:11.663
Is that where you draw the line?

22:17.003 --> 22:19.046
Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.090
You think you're different...

22:21.715 --> 22:23.134
from me?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.930
From him?

22:28.680 --> 22:31.058
But you'll get there.

22:31.142 --> 22:35.562
Sooner or later...
we all do, men like us.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.941
A man like Fisk
just took out your entire operation.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.944
And he may not own all the cops,

22:42.028 --> 22:45.031
but he owns enough that
you won't make it into a prison cell.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.242
Right now, I'm your only shot
at getting out of this building alive.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.869
[breathing heavily]

22:56.875 --> 22:59.003
His lapdog came to us first.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.341
He told us his employer had taken note.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.510
He complimented...

23:06.593 --> 23:08.304
us on our business.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.767
Invited us to be part
of something bigger...

23:15.686 --> 23:17.104
to expand...

23:18.605 --> 23:20.857
if we entered into an agreement.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.359
What did Fisk offer?

23:22.443 --> 23:24.653
Police looking other way...

23:26.030 --> 23:27.949
aid from politicians...

23:30.826 --> 23:34.455
and access to Chinese and their heroin.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.959
-He's working with the Chinese?
-You really don't know anything, do you?

23:39.001 --> 23:43.214
Just snapping at scraps
falling from table.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.381
I want names.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.758
Everything you know about them
and how they connect to Fisk.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.761
There's only one name that matters.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.433
The man that can tie it all together.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.684
Who?

23:58.312 --> 24:00.897
Have you heard of the name...

24:02.899 --> 24:04.776
Leslie Shumway?

24:04.860 --> 24:06.487
No, he work for Fisk?

24:06.570 --> 24:07.863
[chuckles]

24:09.365 --> 24:11.908
American schools... [spits]

24:11.993 --> 24:13.494
almost as bad as Russian.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.037
Come on.

24:15.121 --> 24:19.083
Leslie Shumway was an accountant...

24:20.459 --> 24:23.170
to your... Al Capone.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.464
Okay, you know who Fisk's money man is.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.425
Not just Fisk.
He handled it...

24:31.428 --> 24:32.596
for all of us.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.765
Who is he? Where do I find him?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.601
We were going to rule this city...

24:38.935 --> 24:40.146
my brother and I.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.023
Vladimir, the name!

24:42.939 --> 24:44.400
His name...

24:45.317 --> 24:47.028
His name...

24:48.404 --> 24:49.613
[voice fading] is...

24:51.323 --> 24:53.159
His name is...

24:55.411 --> 24:56.620
[speaking Russian]

24:57.496 --> 24:58.622
[grunting]

25:00.124 --> 25:01.792
[grunting]

25:03.669 --> 25:07.714
This is not how I die.
This is not how it happens.

25:07.798 --> 25:08.965
[grunting]

25:26.275 --> 25:27.859
[people speaking indistinctly]

25:27.943 --> 25:29.027
[sirens wailing]

25:32.656 --> 25:34.408
[reporters speaking indistinctly]

25:40.997 --> 25:44.876
You see that, old timer?
That's you not mattering anymore.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.672
Television's been around a while.
Maybe you've heard.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.258
-Ah, funny guy.
-Yeah, a real crack-up.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.554
How's it feel, Urich,
knowing that your day's passed?

25:55.637 --> 25:59.308
You're like the freaking dinosaurs,
watching that big rock crashing into 'em.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.727
I still got a few good stories in me.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.480
Maybe you two'll pop up in one of them.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.274
Night's young,
never know what might happen.

26:07.358 --> 26:08.942
[TV reporter] We good?
You framed up?

26:09.943 --> 26:12.654
Kyle, authorities have cornered
the suspects in the bombings

26:12.738 --> 26:15.282
that occurred earlier this evening
in Hell's Kitchen,

26:15.366 --> 26:17.909
believing they may have taken
a police officer hostage.

26:17.993 --> 26:21.372
While they haven't released the name
of the police officer in question...

26:21.455 --> 26:24.875
Matt, it's Karen, again.
Uh, where are you?

26:25.792 --> 26:29.255
Would you just please give us a call
when you get this?

26:30.381 --> 26:32.591
He's still not answering.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.344
-Did you try his apartment?
-Three times.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.347
All right, let's not jump
to things people jump to.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.890
Well, he's a blind guy in a war zone.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.558
Seems like jumping's
a pretty reasonable option.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.602
You don't know him like I do.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.188
Sometimes I even forget he can't see,
the way he zips around.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.483
So you're not worried?

26:52.694 --> 26:54.070
I'm gonna go look for him.

26:54.155 --> 26:57.032
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no.
The hell you are.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.200
Lay back.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.788
I'm the closest he has to family.
He'd do the same for me.

27:02.871 --> 27:07.293
I know... and I love that about you guys,
but don't be an idiot.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.336
Wouldn't be the first time.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.587
[chuckles]

27:12.548 --> 27:15.342
You've played the hero enough for one day.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.094
You're here, and safe.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.806
So let's keep it that way, okay?

27:29.731 --> 27:32.651
I am gonna go check downstairs...

27:33.819 --> 27:36.197
make sure Matt hasn't been brought in.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.032
-Karen?
-[gasps] Yeah?

27:41.452 --> 27:43.036
Hell of a first date, huh?

27:43.119 --> 27:44.413
[chuckles]

27:45.622 --> 27:46.790
I've, uh...

27:47.708 --> 27:49.125
actually had worse.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.844
[groans]

28:00.846 --> 28:02.223
[sighing]

28:04.766 --> 28:06.935
[over voice mail] This is Matt Murdock.
Leave a message.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.314
Matt? It's Foggy.

28:11.482 --> 28:13.650
Where are you, buddy?

28:18.447 --> 28:19.740
[coughs]

28:21.367 --> 28:23.535
[groaning]

28:34.755 --> 28:35.756
[groaning]

28:44.348 --> 28:45.641
[spits]

28:55.066 --> 28:56.610
That wasn't very smart.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.321
But it was fun...

29:01.072 --> 29:02.908
watching you bleed.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.077
You think this is a game?

29:07.663 --> 29:09.080
[Vladimir] If it was...

29:11.333 --> 29:13.043
you'd be losing.

-[heart beating slowly]

29:38.234 --> 29:39.278
[heart stops beating]

29:39.361 --> 29:40.529
No...

29:42.614 --> 29:43.740
No...

29:44.908 --> 29:46.159
[grunting]

29:48.995 --> 29:50.038
Come on.

29:52.999 --> 29:56.211
I'm not done with you yet.
You hear me?

29:56.295 --> 29:58.339
I'm not done with you yet.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.591
[grunting]

30:01.091 --> 30:02.926
[coughing]

30:04.970 --> 30:06.179
[inhales sharply]

30:06.262 --> 30:08.264
[coughing]

30:08.349 --> 30:09.600
What...

30:09.683 --> 30:12.353
[Masked Man panting]

30:16.690 --> 30:18.525
What...

30:19.234 --> 30:20.694
You died.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.154
I brought you back.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.075
[grunting]

30:27.158 --> 30:28.660
[Vladimir] You lied, huh?

30:29.828 --> 30:33.540
You can't even stand there
and let me die.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.128
No.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.008
Not until you give me
what I need on Fisk.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.727
[door opening]

30:58.231 --> 31:01.276
Emergency Service Unit is en route.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.154
Blake and Hoffman are clearing a channel.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.250
[female reporter speaking indistinctly]

31:17.333 --> 31:19.169
[siren wailing]

31:24.383 --> 31:26.301
[officer 1] Come on, let's go!
Move! Move!

31:26.385 --> 31:27.844
[officer 2] They're good shots.
[Blake] Then shoot.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.055
Tell those guys,
they shoot anyone who moves.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.765
We got ESU on the scene.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.059
Everybody switch your radios
to channel five

31:34.142 --> 31:35.894
and maintain radio discipline.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.521
-What happens next, Detective?
-[Blake] Don't know.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.440
Maybe you finally get a story
worth printing.

31:39.523 --> 31:40.607
Let's go, fellas.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.701
[distant rumbling]

32:02.629 --> 32:04.631
[rumbling continues]

32:16.602 --> 32:18.186
What are you doing?

32:19.771 --> 32:21.898
Finding us a way out.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.253
[grunting]

32:46.673 --> 32:50.218
[Fisk over radio] I'd like to speak
to the man in the mask, please.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.391
Hello.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.205
Are you there?
Can you hear me?

33:26.797 --> 33:29.925
-Who is this?
-I think you know.

33:30.926 --> 33:35.013
You've been asking about me.
I thought it was time we spoke.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.978
-Say your name.
-You first.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.609
That's what I thought.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.739
You and I have a lot in common.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.116
We're nothing alike.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.953
That's what you'll tell yourself.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.998
You're feeding off this city...
like a cancer.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.710
I want to save this city, like you...

34:06.587 --> 34:08.171
only on a scale that matters.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.298
Now tell that to
the people you've hurt.

34:10.381 --> 34:11.800
Young man...

34:12.718 --> 34:14.302
life is not a fairy tale.

34:14.385 --> 34:19.307
Not everyone deserves...
a happy ending.

34:20.642 --> 34:22.393
I'm gonna find you...

34:23.854 --> 34:25.772
and I'm gonna make you pay
for what you've done.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.398
No, you are not.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.569
Not that I don't admire
what you're trying to do...

34:31.570 --> 34:33.404
to change the world...

34:36.366 --> 34:39.452
with nothing but desire
and your own two hands...

34:40.746 --> 34:43.832
secure in the knowledge
that you're doing the right thing,

34:43.915 --> 34:45.667
the only thing.

34:47.669 --> 34:49.963
That's something that I do understand.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.466
But we both can't have what we want.

34:54.843 --> 34:56.052
So...

34:57.638 --> 34:59.472
your part...

35:00.431 --> 35:04.560
in this drama, by necessity,
comes to an end.

35:07.313 --> 35:10.901
It's gonna take a lot more
than a voice on a radio to stop me.

35:10.984 --> 35:12.903
It's not me you need to worry about.

35:12.986 --> 35:15.697
It's the city
you just blew the hell out of.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.201
[chuckling]

35:21.161 --> 35:22.663
You...

35:22.746 --> 35:24.790
You think anyone's
gonna believe that?

35:24.873 --> 35:27.417
You're running around in a mask,

35:27.500 --> 35:32.338
holing up with a known felon
in the wake of a series of bombings.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.842
There's that police officer
you're holding hostage, so...

35:35.926 --> 35:37.177
yes.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.763
Actually, I do.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.849
But it doesn't have to be this way.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.600
The Russian...

35:44.685 --> 35:46.061
is he alive?

35:46.144 --> 35:48.604
I'm still here, you fat shit!

35:49.272 --> 35:50.899
Does that answer your question?

35:52.108 --> 35:53.944
It's a one-time offer.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.949
You kill the Russian,

35:59.032 --> 36:02.327
and we'll call the night a push.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.413
You know what he's done...

36:06.957 --> 36:08.249
to women...

36:09.167 --> 36:10.626
-to children...
-[Vladimir groaning]

36:10.711 --> 36:14.255
to the people of this city
that you claim to care about.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.134
But do you know how much he enjoyed it?

36:18.218 --> 36:20.887
You just confirmed how important he is.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.432
That must worry you,
what he might tell me.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.810
Which means he hasn't
told you anything yet.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.063
[kicking rubble]

36:30.146 --> 36:33.024
You're a child
playing at being a hero.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.193
No, no,
I'm not trying to be a hero.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.195
I'm just a guy
that got fed up with men like you

36:37.278 --> 36:39.322
and I decided to do something about it.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.950
That's what makes you dangerous.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.368
It's not the mask.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.245
It's not the skills.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.581
It's your ideology.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.918
The lone man...

36:53.754 --> 36:55.797
who thinks he can make a difference.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.174
I'm glad we could talk.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.051
I...

37:00.802 --> 37:04.055
I respect your conviction...

37:04.139 --> 37:07.308
even if it runs counter with...
with my own.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.602
Yeah, keep telling yourself you've won.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.605
It'll make what I'm gonna do to you
so much more satisfying.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.150
Your part ends tonight.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.028
And if that's true,
others will take my place.

37:18.111 --> 37:19.863
They'll see what I was trying to do
and they'll make sure--

37:19.946 --> 37:21.823
No, they won't.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.077
The city will burn you in effigy.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.955
Your name, your very existence...

37:30.331 --> 37:35.003
will be met with abhorrence and disgust.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.507
Do it.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.936
You guys don't seem to be doing
much hostage negotiating.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.479
How many times, Urich?

37:54.189 --> 37:55.899
I told you, back off!

37:55.982 --> 37:57.358
You know, this is bullshit
and you know it.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.444
You want to start giving me
some straight answers, Detective?

37:59.527 --> 38:01.362
Huh, Detective?
You gonna start being straight with me?

38:01.446 --> 38:02.655

Shit!

Get an EMT!
Go! Go!

38:20.924 --> 38:22.050
Go!

[people screaming]

38:31.517 --> 38:34.813
-What did you do?
-[Fisk] What you forced me to do.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.398
Goodbye.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.026
I'm afraid we won't speak again.

38:40.735 --> 38:41.862
Fisk...

38:43.864 --> 38:44.906
Fisk!

38:45.824 --> 38:47.158
Fisk, answer me!

38:49.035 --> 38:50.829
[yells]

38:50.912 --> 38:52.747
Tell our friends to roll the tape.

38:54.875 --> 38:56.084
[phone beeps]

38:57.585 --> 39:00.755
[news anchor] ...authorities ask
that you contact them immediately.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.133
A deadly shooting just moments ago

39:03.216 --> 39:07.053
as three of New York's finest
have been gunned down in Hell's Kitchen.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.931
We still have little information
as to who.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.434
We are just getting word
of a fast development

39:13.518 --> 39:16.187
in the investigation
into the Hell's Kitchen explosions.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.856
[inaudible]

39:17.939 --> 39:18.982
[Foggy] Turn it up.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.275
Hmm?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.568
Turn it up.
I want to hear this.

39:23.569 --> 39:26.489
The authorities
have just released some video.

39:26.572 --> 39:29.825
This is taken
just moments after the explosions

39:29.910 --> 39:32.412
that stunned Hell's Kitchen
earlier tonight,

39:32.495 --> 39:34.039
pulled from a security camera.

39:34.122 --> 39:38.126
And authorities believe
this man is responsible for the bombings,

39:38.209 --> 39:42.213
possibly as part of an ongoing feud
with the Russian mob.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.756
Oh, my God.

39:43.839 --> 39:44.966
That's him.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.634
The same man suspected of

39:46.717 --> 39:49.679
having just shot and killed
the three police officers

39:49.762 --> 39:53.058
-at the scene of a standoff...
-That's the guy who saved my life.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.226
This guy?

39:55.310 --> 39:56.602
Jesus...

39:56.686 --> 39:57.812
You're lucky he didn't kill you.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.772
I don't understand
why he would do something like this.

39:59.855 --> 40:02.150
-He just didn't seem like...
-[news anchor] ...some sort of mask...

40:02.233 --> 40:04.152
I don't know, he just didn't...

40:04.235 --> 40:05.861
General rule...

40:05.946 --> 40:07.613
guys who wear masks
have something to hide,

40:07.697 --> 40:08.781
and it usually ain't good.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.909
...battleground of Hell's Kitchen,
one has to wonder

40:10.992 --> 40:12.953
whose side is this man on?

40:31.054 --> 40:32.263
It's really not a good time.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.683
On the news...
they're saying that you shot those cops.

40:35.766 --> 40:36.809
No.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.229
It was Fisk.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.606
It's all Fisk.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.150
[sighs] What's going on out there?

40:44.234 --> 40:46.486
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-Hang on.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.464
Um...

41:06.547 --> 41:09.925
-What you said, before I left...
-I was...

41:10.010 --> 41:11.886
I'm sorry, I just--

41:11.970 --> 41:14.597
No, don't be.
It turns out you were...

41:14.680 --> 41:16.141
You were right...

41:17.142 --> 41:18.434
about me.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.605
I just don't want you getting caught up
if it goes that way.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.984
If we don't get a chance to talk again...

41:27.110 --> 41:29.154
you take care of yourself.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.240
Matt?

41:33.741 --> 41:34.867
Matt, wait!

41:43.876 --> 41:45.128
[man 1] Clear!

41:45.211 --> 41:46.546
[man 2] Clear!

42:02.687 --> 42:03.771

This is not how I die.

42:29.297 --> 42:32.467

-[muffled] What the fuck? No!

[train passing in the distance]

42:51.361 --> 42:52.528
This way.

43:03.123 --> 43:04.290
Where are we?

43:05.625 --> 43:07.210
Access tunnels.

43:07.293 --> 43:10.130
The city was built on a network of these,
most of them sealed up years ago.

43:10.213 --> 43:11.506
[indistinct radio chatter]

43:12.548 --> 43:15.176
All right, we have to keep moving,
find a way to the street.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.518
Let's go.

44:11.691 --> 44:13.443
There are five more coming.

44:13.526 --> 44:16.154
All working for Fisk,
probably not even real cops.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.364
We don't have time for this.

44:19.574 --> 44:20.825
I think...

44:22.285 --> 44:23.661
maybe I stay.

44:25.580 --> 44:27.415
We can still make it out of here.

44:29.083 --> 44:32.253
-You turn evidence on Fisk, we can--
-He controls...

44:37.132 --> 44:39.885
There's only one way to stop him,
you know this.

44:40.511 --> 44:41.554
No.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.265
I'm not a killer.

44:44.349 --> 44:46.392
The moment you put on the mask...

44:47.310 --> 44:49.937
you got into cage with animals.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.358
Animals don't stop fighting.

44:54.484 --> 44:56.736
Not until one of them is dead.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.405
[groaning]

45:09.624 --> 45:11.459
What Fisk did to me...

45:13.085 --> 45:14.754
he'll do to you.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.467
And he will do it...

45:19.550 --> 45:21.719
to everyone you care about.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.889
Will you feel the same way then?

45:26.432 --> 45:28.309
Or will you be man...

45:30.520 --> 45:33.022
and do what you know you must do?

45:34.690 --> 45:38.068
The dermo who controls money,
his name is...

45:38.694 --> 45:40.863
Leland Owlsley.

45:42.907 --> 45:45.701
He will give you
what you think you want.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.999
But it won't be enough.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.337
You know that now, don't you?

45:56.421 --> 45:58.047
[distant chatter]

46:01.592 --> 46:02.760
Go.

46:03.719 --> 46:04.720
[grunts]

46:16.023 --> 46:18.275
[singing in Russian]

46:21.904 --> 46:23.573
[officers shouting indistinctly]

46:26.116 --> 46:27.117
[officer 1] Got something!

46:27.201 --> 46:28.328
[officer 2] Move! Move! Move!

46:34.584 --> 46:36.794
[guns firing]

46:51.141 --> 46:53.185
[dramatic music playing]
