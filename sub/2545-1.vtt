WEBVTT

01:11.195 --> 01:14.031
Write slip twice. Put money in the bag.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.532
Joe?

01:16.825 --> 01:17.701
Gina.

01:19.203 --> 01:22.038
Lucas, what are you doing in here?

01:22.956 --> 01:25.625
My life has reached its pinnacle.

01:28.545 --> 01:30.672
Joe's letting me close the store tonight.

01:30.964 --> 01:33.383
- You're kidding.
- I am not.

01:33.466 --> 01:35.385
Big responsibility, Lucas.

01:35.468 --> 01:36.344
Yes.

01:36.510 --> 01:39.012
But Joe's rules are extremely simple:

01:39.137 --> 01:40.889
Count money twice...

01:40.973 --> 01:43.016
keep my hands off of his beer...

01:43.225 --> 01:44.643
cigars...

01:44.851 --> 01:46.228
and drumsticks.

01:46.311 --> 01:49.356
My, my, how will you remember it all?

01:49.982 --> 01:51.066
Good luck.

01:51.149 --> 01:52.567
Don't screw it up.

01:56.570 --> 01:59.532
A responsibility like this
requires the obedience...

01:59.699 --> 02:01.117
of a saint.

02:37.651 --> 02:40.778
"Music Town
franchise option agreement"?

02:57.794 --> 02:59.463
They've got to be kidding.

03:01.590 --> 03:04.092
In the immortal words of The Doors:

03:05.761 --> 03:07.971
"The time to hesitate is through."

04:25.794 --> 04:26.878
Twenty-two.

04:27.504 --> 04:29.171
Twenty-two black.

04:30.798 --> 04:32.341
Who was that guy?

04:33.884 --> 04:36.303
Craps! End of roll! New roller!

04:37.763 --> 04:40.516
Place your bets, please.
Get your bets down.

04:41.809 --> 04:43.352
We have a high roller.

04:43.394 --> 04:46.855
$9,104. I counted it. Twice.

04:47.856 --> 04:49.315
I like your style.

04:50.483 --> 04:52.777
Joe told me to count it twice.

04:53.111 --> 04:55.864
No more bets, please. Put your bets down.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.199
Do I just throw it and get a seven?

04:59.241 --> 05:01.660
- That would be very good, sir.
- Feeling lucky?

05:01.744 --> 05:04.163
I'm guided by a force
much greater than luck.

05:05.164 --> 05:06.123
Seven!

05:06.206 --> 05:07.624
A winner!

05:07.708 --> 05:10.586
- Baby, you are sexy!
- I know.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.713
Same lucky shooter.

05:12.754 --> 05:14.465
Get your bets down.

05:14.755 --> 05:18.009
- Hot shooter on the line.
- You know what? Let it ride.

05:20.762 --> 05:22.263
Hot dice coming out.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.975
That's an $18,000 bet.
Sure you know what you're doing, kid?

05:26.184 --> 05:29.061
I know this: That if I win this roll...

05:29.145 --> 05:31.813
I will save the place that I work
from being sold...

05:31.897 --> 05:34.357
and the jobs of my friends that work there.

05:34.774 --> 05:37.152
Thus striking a blow at all that is evil...

05:37.277 --> 05:40.030
and making this world
a better place to live in.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.281
What?

05:43.950 --> 05:46.076
And I'll... buy you guys a drink.

05:46.118 --> 05:47.620
Party! Okay!

05:47.870 --> 05:49.288
Get your bets down.

05:49.455 --> 05:50.623
Joe...

05:51.749 --> 05:53.250
this one's for you.

05:55.711 --> 05:56.587
Two.

05:56.629 --> 05:58.380
- Craps.
- End of roll.

05:58.464 --> 06:01.008
You know something?
You used to be cute.

06:01.342 --> 06:03.593
And you used to have $9,000.

06:07.305 --> 06:10.099
I wonder if I'll be held responsible for this.

06:20.317 --> 06:22.402
What the hell are you doing here, man?

06:23.111 --> 06:26.073
Something happened to me last night
in Atlantic City.

06:26.448 --> 06:27.824
You went to Atlantic City?

06:27.991 --> 06:29.451
Did you win anything?

06:31.161 --> 06:32.995
No. I did not win.

06:33.871 --> 06:36.999
So, if you guys ever wonder
if it was nice to know you...

06:37.166 --> 06:39.502
I tell you, now, that it was.

06:40.169 --> 06:41.963
Shit, man, what happened?

06:42.839 --> 06:44.006
What happened?

06:44.090 --> 06:48.260
I do not regret the things I've done,
but those I did not do.

06:49.135 --> 06:50.762
Lucas, how much?

06:51.012 --> 06:52.180
How much?

06:55.684 --> 06:56.643
Shit.

06:57.853 --> 06:59.980
What do you mean by "shit"? What's up?

07:02.524 --> 07:06.277
Lucas doesn't have any money,
and Joe let him close the store last night.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.695
Yeah? So?

07:10.656 --> 07:13.742
I guess he didn't live up
to his responsibility, did he?

07:14.034 --> 07:17.162
No, not the full responsibility. Shut up.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.998
What's up, Joe?

07:21.332 --> 07:23.459
What's up with the boss threads, man?

07:24.168 --> 07:27.297
- Frigging Rex Manning Day.
- What's up with the hostility?

07:42.060 --> 07:43.061
Phone.

07:43.812 --> 07:47.065
Right. Empire Records,
open till midnight. This is Mark.

07:48.525 --> 07:49.901
It's the bank.

07:53.487 --> 07:54.655
Yeah, it's Joe.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.450
Are you sure?

07:58.492 --> 07:59.911
It should be.

08:00.244 --> 08:02.163
Empire Records, open till midnight.
This is Mark.

08:02.246 --> 08:03.914
I don't know. I'll have to check.

08:03.998 --> 08:06.082
- It's the boss.
- Give me a sec, please.

08:08.418 --> 08:11.963
Yeah, Mitch. Will you stop yelling, please?

08:12.255 --> 08:13.506
What's wrong?

08:14.424 --> 08:15.717
What is it?

08:16.468 --> 08:18.595
Lucas? No way. Come on.

08:19.929 --> 08:21.222
Here he comes.

08:44.118 --> 08:45.620
Damn it, Lucas!

08:51.876 --> 08:53.251
What's the matter?

08:57.297 --> 09:00.133
- Surprise!
- What is it?

09:00.217 --> 09:02.219
Happy Rex Manning Day.

09:02.469 --> 09:04.805
When did you have time to make these?

09:04.930 --> 09:07.975
Dad says there are 24 usable hours
in every day. Thank you.

09:08.432 --> 09:11.060
You absolutely amaze me. You are a nerd.

09:11.268 --> 09:12.395
That's me.

09:15.898 --> 09:17.733
- So?
- So.

09:18.693 --> 09:19.985
So today...

09:20.152 --> 09:23.988
- I will offer myself to Rex Manning.
- All right!

09:25.573 --> 09:26.574
I love you.

09:27.575 --> 09:28.702
Like this.

09:29.327 --> 09:31.579
Get your tongue off my record.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.960
Do you think Rex is the right guy
for my first time?

09:38.962 --> 09:42.006
I think he's perfect for you, Corey.

09:46.343 --> 09:48.095
I need to ask your advice.

09:48.178 --> 09:52.099
You know a lot about love
and women and that sort of thing.

09:52.307 --> 09:56.352
My wife left me for another woman, and
my girlfriend made me leave at gunpoint.

09:56.686 --> 09:59.105
- Does this qualify me?
- Definitely.

09:59.897 --> 10:03.860
I've decided today's the day
that I'll tell Corey how I feel about her.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.529
I know what you're thinking,
but I really am.

10:06.612 --> 10:10.199
I've been working here off and on
for five years, so...

10:10.741 --> 10:12.993
I've got to tell her how I feel.

10:13.243 --> 10:14.369
That I...

10:15.787 --> 10:16.955
Love her.

10:17.873 --> 10:19.541
How do I do that?

10:21.710 --> 10:23.295
You say, "I love you."

10:23.795 --> 10:25.714
You want written instructions?

10:27.089 --> 10:29.842
If I find that kid, I swear I'll kill him.

10:30.509 --> 10:32.219
- I'll tell her this morning.
- Good.

10:32.303 --> 10:34.138
By noon. Definitely.

10:34.221 --> 10:35.681
No. By noon or 1:00.

10:36.474 --> 10:38.893
By 1:37 exactly, Joe.

10:41.395 --> 10:42.604
Good luck.

10:43.063 --> 10:44.189
Thank you.

10:51.905 --> 10:55.200
I remember the first time he sang it
on The Family Way.

10:55.241 --> 10:58.285
I got so excited I almost choked
on a pretzel.

10:58.368 --> 10:59.787
- Don't go in there.
- Why?

10:59.870 --> 11:03.916
I got something to tell you. Both of you.

11:04.416 --> 11:07.753
Come on, Lucas, pick up the phone.
Pick it up.

11:08.504 --> 11:10.172
Come on, buckethead!

11:10.923 --> 11:12.132
Hi, Joe.

11:12.633 --> 11:15.343
- Does Joe know?
- Nope. Just act normal.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.804
- What's up, Joe?
- What's new?

11:17.887 --> 11:19.764
- How you doing?
- Damn!

11:20.556 --> 11:21.766
I got green!

11:21.849 --> 11:24.185
Let's see who goes first. I got a brown!

11:24.560 --> 11:26.604
- Anybody got brown?
- Brown.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.814
Orange.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.817
Shit!

12:30.247 --> 12:32.957
- What are you doing, man?
- Exercising my veto, man.

12:33.082 --> 12:35.710
It's only 9:00.
You sure you want to do that?

12:35.793 --> 12:38.170
Listening to this crap
will make you sterile.

12:40.756 --> 12:42.800
Maybe I want to be sterile.

12:51.016 --> 12:52.434
What are you doing here?

12:52.601 --> 12:56.271
Calculus. I hate it,
but my dad says I've got to get an A.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.815
You're not on until this afternoon.

13:00.192 --> 13:01.985
It's Rex Manning Day.

13:03.819 --> 13:05.404
Rex Manning Day.

13:05.988 --> 13:09.158
Oh, Rexy, you're so sexy.

13:46.235 --> 13:48.903
Mark, could you please not sing?

13:50.863 --> 13:52.323
You know what, Joe?

13:52.406 --> 13:55.368
One of these days,
I'm going to show you little people.

13:55.409 --> 13:58.704
On that day,
I'll jump out of my wheelchair and dance.

13:58.829 --> 14:00.247
How about today?

14:00.331 --> 14:01.874
Rex Manning Day.

14:12.717 --> 14:15.095
- Where's the money?
- The money is gone.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.013
Yeah, I know it's gone.

14:17.722 --> 14:18.682
Where's it gone to?

14:19.182 --> 14:20.599
Atlantic City.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.185
Is it coming back from Atlantic City?

14:24.853 --> 14:26.272
I don't think so.

14:26.605 --> 14:28.774
What's it doing in Atlantic City?

14:29.108 --> 14:30.484
Recirculating.

14:38.950 --> 14:40.243
Are you pissed off?

14:43.955 --> 14:45.456
Lucas, listen to me.

14:45.665 --> 14:49.252
I told Mitchell Beck
that you forgot to deposit the money.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.837
I told him the money was still here.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.798
Joe, that's not true. It's in Atlantic City.

14:55.507 --> 14:56.591
I swear.

14:58.927 --> 15:01.179
Shut up, sit down, and don't you move.

15:01.471 --> 15:04.558
- It could be in other cities by now.
- Shut up!

15:04.975 --> 15:09.270
Under no circumstances do I want you
to leave that couch.

15:10.646 --> 15:13.024
Unless it's to get me $9,000.

15:13.399 --> 15:15.359
Then you bring it here to me.

15:20.614 --> 15:22.116
I think it'll be okay.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.159
What makes you think that?

15:24.534 --> 15:27.787
Who knows where thoughts come from?
They just appear.

15:30.331 --> 15:31.583
What a moron.

15:35.128 --> 15:37.339
- Are you Corey Mason?
- For me?

15:38.088 --> 15:39.173
Thank you.

15:39.548 --> 15:40.632
Later.
- 'Bye, thank you.

15:41.508 --> 15:45.012
"To the number one in her class.
Harvard, 1999.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.849
"Make me proud. Love, Daddy."
That's sweet.

15:48.974 --> 15:51.143
God, nothing's ever enough for him.

15:51.477 --> 15:55.146
He didn't mean it like that.
I'm sure he didn't.

15:55.521 --> 15:56.773
Excuse me.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.109
Hi. How are you today?

16:32.932 --> 16:34.308
Hi, Debra.

16:37.436 --> 16:40.772
- She hates me.
- Yeah, she hates me, too.

16:41.272 --> 16:44.067
But I have enough sense to hate her back.

16:48.196 --> 16:49.656
- Good morning, Deb.
- Hi, Deb.

16:57.955 --> 16:59.415
Lucas, are you in trouble?

17:00.249 --> 17:01.875
Did you need the money?

17:02.751 --> 17:05.421
If you are in trouble, you can talk to me.
You know that.

17:06.088 --> 17:10.008
We're all in some kind of trouble.
Am I the only one who sees it?

17:10.843 --> 17:12.385
You know, Deb's in trouble.

17:13.803 --> 17:16.097
- A.J.'s in trouble.
- A.J.'s not in trouble.

17:16.180 --> 17:17.890
And Corey is in trouble.

17:17.973 --> 17:19.684
She's not in trouble.
She's going to Harvard.

17:19.767 --> 17:21.477
Mark's in trouble. Eddie's in trouble...

17:21.560 --> 17:23.938
Hey, I'm the one who's in trouble here.

17:24.396 --> 17:25.731
'Cause every minute that goes by...

17:25.772 --> 17:28.942
and I don't call the cops
I look like a bigger bananahead.

17:29.025 --> 17:33.238
Joe, I can categorically say
that you are not a bigger bananahead.

17:33.947 --> 17:36.074
You screwed me, Lucas.
You know that, right?

17:36.324 --> 17:37.617
What do you want me to do?

17:37.701 --> 17:41.580
- Call Mitchell? Tell him I lied?
- It seems like a viable option.

17:42.997 --> 17:46.208
I swear to God,
if you're fooling with me, I will kill you.

17:51.297 --> 17:54.133
- A.J., I need another closer.
- I opened, man.

17:54.425 --> 17:55.885
Come on. I wouldn't ask...

17:56.302 --> 17:58.137
but I have got no choice.

17:58.303 --> 17:59.596
I can close.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.808
Yeah, I can close. It's cool.

18:04.058 --> 18:06.686
They just raised my rent,
so I could use the money.

18:06.978 --> 18:08.605
Damn the man!

18:08.938 --> 18:11.399
Oh, God, I am in hell!

19:36.395 --> 19:40.274
You think it's possible for someone to be in
love with someone else and not even know it?

19:41.817 --> 19:45.320
In this life,
there are nothing but possibilities.

19:47.321 --> 19:48.489
That's good.

19:48.906 --> 19:51.534
I must tell Corey I love her by 1:37.

19:52.618 --> 19:54.245
That's an excellent time.

20:03.295 --> 20:06.006
You did have hair
when you went in there, right?

20:06.089 --> 20:08.758
It's still in the sink if you want to glue it.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.180
Is it true you committed
the perfect crime?

20:15.140 --> 20:16.850
Not entirely perfect.

20:20.102 --> 20:21.228
You see that, man?

20:25.566 --> 20:28.485
- What's with you today?
- Bad hair day.

20:29.111 --> 20:31.071
No, I mean with this. What is this?

20:32.281 --> 20:35.408
- What happened?
- I went to rock and roll heaven...

20:35.491 --> 20:38.620
and I wasn't on the guest list.
Now please move, I have to go to work.

20:39.579 --> 20:42.040
No. Now you tell me what is going on!

20:42.957 --> 20:47.420
I decided I'd rather kill myself than meet
Rex Manning. Excuse me, I'm going.

20:47.545 --> 20:49.963
Listen to me, this isn't funny.
I'm not joking.

20:50.172 --> 20:52.716
I won't let you leave
until you tell me what's going on.

20:53.008 --> 20:55.260
- Mind your own business.
- She's fine.

20:56.261 --> 20:57.721
She's amazing.

21:00.182 --> 21:01.266
Thank you.

21:03.477 --> 21:05.020
She's in the store.

21:05.353 --> 21:07.021
She's going to be okay.

21:08.356 --> 21:09.690
What's with you?
Yesterday you were normal...

21:09.815 --> 21:13.194
today you're like the Chinese guy
from The Karate Kid.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.614
What's with you today?

21:16.989 --> 21:19.033
What's with "today" today?

21:21.326 --> 21:22.619
I don't know.

21:35.006 --> 21:36.507
Why'd you do that?

21:36.590 --> 21:39.635
I'm just your typical nutty teenager
in America.

21:39.843 --> 21:42.388
Before you hear all about it...

21:44.139 --> 21:45.641
That's supposed to be a joke, right?

21:46.016 --> 21:47.601
No. You're the joke.

21:57.485 --> 21:59.862
Well, Sinead O'Rebellion...

22:00.780 --> 22:04.200
shock me, shock me, shock me
with that deviant behavior.

22:04.909 --> 22:08.662
That is so clever. You get smarter
the shorter your skirt gets.

22:08.870 --> 22:13.333
And you get smarter
the shorter your hair gets...
so it's probably a good thing
you went with that.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.294
- It's a wonderful look for you, darling.
- Thank you.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.783
I have to go to the bathroom.

22:50.743 --> 22:52.871
I want to report a robbery.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.955
No, I will not hold...

23:07.509 --> 23:08.719
Excuse me.

23:09.428 --> 23:10.595
Excuse me.

23:13.973 --> 23:15.308
Veto!

23:16.184 --> 23:17.769
What's up with that?

23:17.852 --> 23:20.980
It's too early.
It makes the customers all crazy-like.

23:21.230 --> 23:22.899
That's the whole point.

23:23.941 --> 23:24.901
Eddie!

23:24.942 --> 23:27.527
What's up, dude?
I heard your music playing.

23:27.611 --> 23:29.779
- That's pretty scary stuff.
- Yeah, it was moshy.

23:30.197 --> 23:33.241
I'm glad to say I made you
a tape last night, for educational purposes.

23:34.159 --> 23:37.829
Here's the deal.
You start off with a little classical music.

23:38.830 --> 23:41.790
Then you got some Shaggs on there,
and Residents...

23:42.208 --> 23:45.044
- and a little Floyd and Zeppelin.
- Floyd is very cool.

23:45.127 --> 23:48.255
And another very cool thing is,
I made you these.

23:49.048 --> 23:51.967
They're my special recipe
and you know what that means.

23:52.009 --> 23:53.260
Lots of sugar.

23:54.261 --> 23:56.971
You got to understand something here.

23:57.472 --> 23:59.933
This music is the glue of the world.

24:00.016 --> 24:02.685
It holds it all together. Without this...

24:03.269 --> 24:05.480
life would be meaningless.

24:06.272 --> 24:08.399
Dude, have you heard about Lucas?

24:12.986 --> 24:17.241
Lucas, man, I heard you went to Vegas
and married a mobster's wife...

24:17.324 --> 24:20.452
and now you've got a hit on you.
Is that true?

24:21.411 --> 24:23.330
Not entirely true.

24:24.373 --> 24:26.625
Outlaw Man, we salute you.

24:26.833 --> 24:27.917
Thank you.

24:28.167 --> 24:31.712
- No problem.
- This song goes out to our employee of the week, Lucas.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.297
A little tribute, man.

25:12.710 --> 25:14.295
What the hell's this?

25:15.920 --> 25:18.882
"Rules and standards
for Music Town employee conduct"?

25:19.716 --> 25:21.342
Put these in the boxes.

25:21.467 --> 25:24.679
- Music Town? We're not a Music Town.
- No, we're not a Music Town...

25:25.847 --> 25:26.806
yet.

25:26.973 --> 25:28.474
Isn't Music Town a chain?

25:28.683 --> 25:32.352
- "No gum chewing will be allowed inside the store"?
- They're turning us into a Music Town?

25:32.477 --> 25:35.689
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Because I was trying to stop it.

25:35.731 --> 25:37.190
What do you mean?

25:37.232 --> 25:40.694
I got enough money to make Mitch an offer.
He was going to make me a partner.

25:41.737 --> 25:43.322
I could have bought him out, eventually.

25:43.405 --> 25:44.406
You were going to buy Empire?

25:44.489 --> 25:46.949
- That's a good thing, right?
- That'll be fantastic.

25:47.992 --> 25:50.036
Do you think it'll happen now?

25:50.536 --> 25:52.788
I must pay for what Mr. Brilliant did.

25:52.872 --> 25:55.583
- It's over, kids, okay?
- Mitchell is the man.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.544
And "the man" calls all the shots.

25:58.628 --> 26:00.212
Damn the man.

26:01.546 --> 26:03.256
Let me explain it to you.

26:03.590 --> 26:06.217
Mitchell's the man, I'm the idiot...

26:06.593 --> 26:09.554
and you're the screw-up,
and we're all losers.

26:10.096 --> 26:11.765
Welcome to Music Town.

26:21.607 --> 26:23.192
"No visible tattoos."

26:23.275 --> 26:24.902
"No revealing clothing."

26:25.861 --> 26:27.321
We're both screwed.

26:27.947 --> 26:29.823
At least you're used to it.

26:30.032 --> 26:31.992
No, Debra, don't be bitter.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.994
With your ever-growing collection of...

26:35.078 --> 26:37.705
flesh-mutilating silver appendages...

26:37.830 --> 26:41.668
and your brand-new
neo-Nazi boot-camp makeover...

26:41.876 --> 26:45.588
- the boys will come running.
- Let's not fight, let's just rip.

26:50.133 --> 26:52.177
But we mustn't dwell.

26:52.928 --> 26:54.304
No, not today.

26:56.139 --> 26:57.265
We can't!

27:02.604 --> 27:04.438
Not on Rex Manning Day.

28:20.802 --> 28:23.262
Is it okay if I leave the couch,
'cause I'm leaving the couch, okay?

28:24.346 --> 28:28.017
My ass has fallen asleep.
I've got to go. I'm leaving.

28:41.905 --> 28:45.033
- I notice you didn't leave the couch.
- Not the whole couch.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.745
I've decided I'm going to start a band.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.205
Really?

28:51.831 --> 28:54.124
First thing you need is a name.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.960
Then you'll know what kind of band it is.

28:58.086 --> 28:59.838
Yeah, I know, I know.

29:00.464 --> 29:02.341
I was thinking of "Marc."

29:02.591 --> 29:04.009
What do you think?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.678
Is that with a "c" or a "k"?

29:10.348 --> 29:11.974
My name is with...

29:13.101 --> 29:14.227
a "k."

29:15.269 --> 29:18.397
So I was thinking
maybe my band could be with a "c"...

29:18.981 --> 29:21.609
so that way it's a psychedelic trip thing.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.903
Always play with their minds.

29:32.494 --> 29:33.995
Nice selection.

29:37.958 --> 29:41.001
- Help you with anything?
- No, I'm all right.

29:41.085 --> 29:43.337
- You like music?
- Yeah.

29:43.879 --> 29:45.089
Me, too.

29:45.965 --> 29:48.133
The fat man walks alone.

29:49.426 --> 29:50.636
What's up?

29:50.928 --> 29:53.097
What are you, some kind of weirdo?

29:54.390 --> 29:57.308
It's a big coat you're wearing.
Lots of pocket room.

30:00.186 --> 30:01.271
See you.

30:01.688 --> 30:03.314
I'm sure I'll bump into you.

30:10.863 --> 30:13.365
Shoplifter!

30:30.631 --> 30:34.218
Isn't it customary to leave the scene
after committing a crime?

30:34.302 --> 30:35.595
Definitely an amateur.

30:39.891 --> 30:42.475
Attention, Rex Manning fans, to your left...

30:42.517 --> 30:46.146
you will notice a shoplifter
being chased by the night manager.

30:46.396 --> 30:48.148
This young man will be caught...

30:48.231 --> 30:52.235
deep-fried in a vat of hot oil,
and served to our first 100 customers.

30:53.486 --> 30:57.865
Just another tasty treat
from the gang at Empire Records.

31:12.046 --> 31:12.838
Shit.

31:17.967 --> 31:20.470
- He cut it too short.
- No, it's fine. Really.

31:20.553 --> 31:22.013
It's fabulous.

31:24.724 --> 31:25.808
Oh, God.

31:25.975 --> 31:27.310
Look at this place!

31:27.435 --> 31:30.187
There is no gig too small, all right?

31:30.228 --> 31:33.815
Middle America buys your records.
We got a lot of fans waiting.

31:35.567 --> 31:38.737
This is Joe Reaves
from the Empire Records store.

31:39.196 --> 31:41.907
We have a shoplifter in custody.

31:44.075 --> 31:45.284
How old are you?

31:45.368 --> 31:49.205
Old enough to kick your butt through your skull
and splatter your brains on the wall.

31:49.246 --> 31:50.539
He's a juvenile.

31:53.167 --> 31:54.543
What's your name?

31:55.044 --> 31:56.462
Warren Beatty.

31:56.921 --> 31:58.673
Okay, stand up.

32:01.091 --> 32:02.509
Hold these against your chest,
stand against the wall.

32:02.592 --> 32:04.219
Let them photograph you.

32:04.302 --> 32:06.221
Why don't you shove them up your ass?

32:06.263 --> 32:08.431
Because it would hurt a lot, Warren.

32:09.015 --> 32:10.183
Take him over there.

32:14.980 --> 32:17.982
And they said no revealing clothing,
didn't they?

32:18.941 --> 32:23.237
I think Music Town is actually torn
on the revealing garment issue.

32:23.654 --> 32:24.989
I think so.

32:25.239 --> 32:26.740
Revealing clothing.

32:41.796 --> 32:43.256
Gina, would you get dressed.

32:45.008 --> 32:46.175
Turn that down.

32:46.259 --> 32:48.343
A.J., up on the roof. Fix the sign.

32:48.635 --> 32:50.095
Take the photograph.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.141
Music Town. I can handle Music Town.

33:00.689 --> 33:03.441
Welcome to Music Town.
May I service you?

33:06.110 --> 33:07.069
Gina...

33:07.278 --> 33:09.196
get dressed. Corey, work.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.282
You must be Joe Reaves.

33:11.365 --> 33:12.992
You must be Jane.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.535
Me, Joe. You, Jane.

33:14.618 --> 33:15.953
Shut up, Warren.

33:16.954 --> 33:19.205
- This is Rex Manning.
- Pleased to meet you.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.124
We all love the new album.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.208
Good for you.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.793
What's he doing here?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.463
Let me introduce you.

33:26.504 --> 33:29.340
This is Gina. This is Corey.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.800
Lucas, A.J...

33:30.842 --> 33:32.761
and Warren.

33:33.635 --> 33:35.846
I'm Rex. Great to be here.

33:35.929 --> 33:37.598
I have all...

33:37.848 --> 33:39.141
your albums.

33:39.850 --> 33:42.186
That's terrific, Corey. Thanks.

33:42.269 --> 33:43.979
What happened to your hair?

33:46.523 --> 33:50.276
The stylist, if you can call him that,
got carried away. No biggie.

33:50.485 --> 33:51.611
Looks good.

33:51.694 --> 33:52.570
See, he likes it?

33:52.653 --> 33:54.363
I like it.

33:55.031 --> 33:55.823
Great.

33:55.865 --> 33:57.241
Let's go to work.

33:58.159 --> 33:59.160
Higher.

34:14.174 --> 34:15.759
That was fabulous, Warren, thank you.

34:21.514 --> 34:22.848
Women.

34:24.891 --> 34:26.726
I still don't like my hair.

34:26.976 --> 34:28.646
Just try to smile.

34:31.232 --> 34:32.650
I don't like the chair.

34:32.733 --> 34:34.360
What do you mean,
you don't like the chair?

34:35.069 --> 34:37.695
What's wrong with the chair?
Just sit in the chair.

34:37.737 --> 34:39.364
I don't want to sit in it.

34:41.282 --> 34:42.951
You're going to stand there?

34:44.661 --> 34:47.205
Mr. Manning, this is a very nice chair.

34:48.331 --> 34:49.581
Thank you.

34:50.583 --> 34:51.708
Pen.

34:53.001 --> 34:54.837
- What's your name?
- Kathy.

34:55.045 --> 34:56.922
K-A-T-H-Y.

34:58.132 --> 35:01.385
I've seen every episode of The Family Way.

35:01.885 --> 35:03.595
You were my favorite singer
in high school.

35:06.056 --> 35:07.974
Who's your favorite singer now?

35:08.391 --> 35:10.226
You! It's still you!

35:38.919 --> 35:40.796
There're so many babes out there!

35:40.921 --> 35:44.008
I've got to get Rex some water
because Rex is very thirsty.

35:44.967 --> 35:46.719
Make sure it's bottled water.

35:49.013 --> 35:51.056
Who's your favorite singer?

35:51.432 --> 35:52.308
Axl.

35:53.349 --> 35:56.311
If Axl Rose was driving
down the highway...

35:56.478 --> 35:59.772
and saw Rex Manning stranded
on the side of the road...

35:59.939 --> 36:02.108
would Axl Rose stop and help him?

36:05.945 --> 36:07.780
Does Axl have a jack?

36:08.156 --> 36:13.202
No way, man! Axl would spin the wheel,
take aim, pound on the gas...

36:14.620 --> 36:16.497
and take that sucker out!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.920
Warren! Where do you get
this hostility from?

36:35.306 --> 36:37.141
Who glued these quarters down?

36:37.308 --> 36:38.059
I did.

36:38.142 --> 36:40.101
What the hell for, man?

36:40.644 --> 36:43.605
I don't feel that I need
to explain my art to you.

36:46.858 --> 36:48.401
Look what you took.

36:48.693 --> 36:49.778
Rap...

36:50.362 --> 36:51.571
...metal...

36:52.113 --> 36:53.323
...rap...

36:53.907 --> 36:54.991
...metal...

36:55.866 --> 36:57.368
...Whitney Houston.

36:57.701 --> 36:59.161
It's for my girlfriend, okay.

36:59.203 --> 37:00.496
Sure it is.

37:00.663 --> 37:03.332
Someone like you needs
to diminish their criminal impulses...

37:03.374 --> 37:06.293
not magnify them.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.379
Maybe some jazz or classical.

37:08.879 --> 37:10.464
Maybe you bite me.

37:11.839 --> 37:13.299
Do any of you...

37:13.383 --> 37:15.134
like Rex Manning's new record?

37:20.431 --> 37:23.184
Dance Party, U.S.A.
Teenybopper type of shit.

37:24.727 --> 37:27.354
It tested well among teenage males.

37:28.230 --> 37:32.234
Did you compare the percentage
of teenage male Rex Manning fans...

37:32.317 --> 37:35.696
to the incidents of homosexuality
among teenage males?

37:36.697 --> 37:37.656
No.

37:40.701 --> 37:42.160
Who should I make it out to?

37:42.868 --> 37:44.078
Denise.

37:45.746 --> 37:47.456
Denise. I've always loved that name.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.709
Thank you, but it's not mine,
it's my mom's.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.086
She loves you.
I've never even heard of you.

37:54.422 --> 37:56.924
Does your mother
still have her own teeth?

37:57.216 --> 37:58.383
Forget it.

37:58.675 --> 38:00.010
Cool hair.

38:17.818 --> 38:18.652
Berko.

38:18.736 --> 38:20.946
Lucas, heard a story about you.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.406
Really? Which one?

38:22.573 --> 38:24.116
The one where you stole $9,000...

38:25.326 --> 38:26.994
went to Atlantic City...

38:27.077 --> 38:29.038
and there's a contract out on you.

38:29.787 --> 38:32.206
Has anyone seen Debra today?

38:32.457 --> 38:33.916
We saw her.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.585
She shaved her head...

38:35.710 --> 38:37.837
and has a bandage on her wrist.

38:38.338 --> 38:39.422
Really?

38:39.464 --> 38:40.590
Really.

38:42.633 --> 38:43.801
Who are you?

38:44.177 --> 38:45.302
I'm Jane.

38:47.179 --> 38:49.014
I work for Rex Manning.

38:56.772 --> 38:58.440
You think that's funny?

39:02.943 --> 39:04.487
If you'll excuse me.

39:05.446 --> 39:07.073
You're quitting? You can't quit.

39:07.156 --> 39:09.450
It's not them. It's Rex.

39:09.742 --> 39:11.619
You know, I don't even like his music.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.996
Come on Jane. You gotta stay.

39:14.121 --> 39:15.289
I need a change of scenery.

39:15.331 --> 39:17.499
Honey, come on. You can't do it to...

39:20.502 --> 39:22.962
I can't believe it. She quit.

41:01.638 --> 41:04.892
Excuse me, ladies.
Less shimmy, more selling. Thanks.

41:05.433 --> 41:07.226
Guess who's here.

41:09.103 --> 41:11.647
How are you?
Mitchell Beck. I own this place.

41:11.731 --> 41:13.816
Good to meet you. You have a nice store.

41:13.900 --> 41:17.278
Nice of you to say.
You should have seen it originally.

41:17.487 --> 41:19.280
Beck's Bath and Bidet.

41:19.363 --> 41:22.699
Bathroom fixtures emporium.
My grandfather started it.

41:22.949 --> 41:27.496
It was my beatnik father
who turned it into a record store.
I tell you, if I was selling toilets today

41:28.079 --> 41:29.581
I'd be a rich man.

41:30.957 --> 41:33.001
What's with you?
You're sweating like a pig.

41:33.084 --> 41:34.794
It's nice to see you, too.

41:35.545 --> 41:38.214
Joe, come on.
Is this the way we treat Mr. Manning?

41:38.297 --> 41:40.800
- Where's the fresh fruit? Champagne?
- That's not necessary, thank you.

41:40.883 --> 41:42.218
No, no, please.

41:42.301 --> 41:44.345
- He's a big star.
- Big, huge star. Big.

41:44.470 --> 41:45.971
Let's get him something.

41:48.724 --> 41:52.769
I'm going to the bank.
Give me last night's deposit.

41:52.852 --> 41:53.895
I wanna make sure it gets there this time.
- I'll take care of it.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.855
No, you're a busy man, let me.

41:57.524 --> 41:59.025
I said I'll handle it.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.867
Mitch, have you met Warren?

42:08.951 --> 42:10.035
Who're you?

42:10.118 --> 42:12.287
Lucas. I work here.

42:13.121 --> 42:14.957
Have you met Warren?

42:15.123 --> 42:17.292
I wanted to talk to you about him.

42:17.459 --> 42:19.711
Young Warren came into the store today...

42:19.795 --> 42:23.339
and put on a little demonstration
for all the store employees.

42:23.464 --> 42:26.801
Very motivational.
It was inspiring, actually.

42:26.968 --> 42:30.263
He just made quite an impression
on everybody.

42:30.471 --> 42:32.932
I'm intrigued. I'm spellbound.

42:34.267 --> 42:37.103
That wasn't so hard, was it? Thank you.

42:53.994 --> 42:55.452
Like your hair.

43:00.499 --> 43:01.709
Are you okay?

43:01.834 --> 43:03.711
Why do you care?
You didn't care last night.

43:03.794 --> 43:05.129
Yes, I did.

43:06.630 --> 43:09.216
Look, this isn't about you, okay?

43:09.757 --> 43:13.511
I got home last night and I thought
about everything that had happened...

43:14.012 --> 43:16.598
and what happened the night before that...

43:16.681 --> 43:19.851
and the week before that
and the year before that.

43:19.934 --> 43:24.188
The only thing that was different was
something else was making me feel shitty.

43:24.355 --> 43:26.023
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

43:26.106 --> 43:28.483
I just said, this wasn't about you.

43:30.611 --> 43:33.989
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'm screwed up.

43:34.072 --> 43:35.198
We're all screwed up.

43:35.282 --> 43:37.034
Don't touch me right now.

43:37.367 --> 43:40.287
I just want you to get up
and I want you to walk away.

43:48.377 --> 43:49.462
Corey...

43:50.129 --> 43:53.382
...I've got to tell you something.
It's about how I feel about you.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.720
I really, really...

44:01.890 --> 44:03.475
Oh, God...

44:03.934 --> 44:06.645
You know that feeling you get
when you get out of a hot bath?

44:06.895 --> 44:09.731
You just feel really refreshed and nice.

44:10.106 --> 44:12.858
Well, you make me feel like...
You make me feel like a bath?

44:12.983 --> 44:16.445
You're like vanilla ice cream.
French vanilla ice cream.

45:33.434 --> 45:34.768
This is bullshit!

45:34.893 --> 45:38.522
The long arm of the law
has embraced our dear friend Warren.

45:39.189 --> 45:41.608
I'm Joe Reaves, manager.
Everything okay?

45:41.692 --> 45:43.986
Joe, tell them what he did.

45:44.028 --> 45:46.529
- You need a statement?
- No, Mr. Lucas gave us one.

45:46.571 --> 45:49.741
Mr. Lucas over there. He took $9,000!

45:50.450 --> 45:52.910
- That's enough.
- I only took a couple of CDs.

45:53.536 --> 45:54.579
Come on!

45:54.871 --> 45:57.623
- Lucas, I thought you were my friend.
- Don't let the man get you down.

45:57.707 --> 45:59.917
I don't wanna see you back in the store.

46:00.001 --> 46:02.836
I'm gonna get you!
I'm not playing this time!

46:02.961 --> 46:05.380
I'll be back and you'll be sorry!

46:05.505 --> 46:07.424
You'll hang for this!

46:08.175 --> 46:09.926
"You'll be sorry!"

46:10.135 --> 46:11.803
I'm already sorry.

46:31.322 --> 46:34.407
Hi. I'm just doing
the quarterly income tax returns.

46:34.491 --> 46:35.867
Almost done.

46:40.163 --> 46:41.831
Look, Deb...

46:43.917 --> 46:46.086
if you need to talk about anything...

46:47.420 --> 46:49.213
You gonna fix me, Joe?

46:51.090 --> 46:52.883
Fix me. I'll listen.

46:53.759 --> 46:55.719
I didn't mean that.

46:55.928 --> 46:57.888
Should I call your mother or something?

46:59.431 --> 47:02.518
Great. You know, if you find her,
could you give me her number?

47:02.601 --> 47:05.061
Because I'd like to talk to her myself.

47:07.730 --> 47:09.690
I know you didn't mean anything.

47:14.737 --> 47:16.364
You're doing a good job.

47:25.455 --> 47:27.124
I feel a lot better.

47:31.128 --> 47:32.170
Dear.

47:32.295 --> 47:34.005
Best boss in the world.

47:34.089 --> 47:36.048
Can I bring Rex his lunch?

47:36.257 --> 47:37.800
Berko's taking him his lunch.

47:38.467 --> 47:42.972
You know that Berko's going to insult him
right to his face. It's not a good idea.

47:43.138 --> 47:46.767
I don't care if Berko sticks an M-80
up his butt and lights it.

47:46.851 --> 47:49.645
I hope he sticks one up mine.
It'd be an improvement.

47:50.937 --> 47:53.022
I have to bring Rex his lunch.

47:53.148 --> 47:54.440
Berko is.

47:54.732 --> 47:57.485
Joe, I need to bring him his lunch.

47:58.570 --> 47:59.821
Berko is.

48:00.155 --> 48:02.782
I'm bringing Rex his lunch!

48:04.826 --> 48:05.951
All right.

48:07.661 --> 48:08.996
Thanks, Joe.

48:09.830 --> 48:11.582
Thanks a lot.

48:49.868 --> 48:51.328
Guava food groups.

48:51.494 --> 48:52.912
Good-bye, Mark.

48:56.207 --> 48:58.584
Well, this looks very elegant.

49:01.378 --> 49:05.174
Boy, talking to all those women
can make you work up an appetite.

49:07.551 --> 49:08.801
I'll bet it does.

49:10.303 --> 49:12.972
I got everything. I'm all set. Thank you.

49:13.097 --> 49:14.515
So am I.

49:20.230 --> 49:24.441
I can't help but notice
you sitting there staring at me.

49:24.691 --> 49:28.820
I was thinking how I used to imagine marrying
you when you were on The Family Way.

49:30.364 --> 49:31.573
Marrying me?

49:31.657 --> 49:33.533
You must've been a baby back then.

49:39.081 --> 49:40.831
I'm not a baby now.

49:44.001 --> 49:45.711
You're a sweet girl.

49:48.881 --> 49:51.050
I'm not as sweet as you think.

49:51.884 --> 49:53.219
How old are you?

49:54.262 --> 49:55.720
Old enough.

50:02.102 --> 50:03.895
Sure you want to do this?

50:04.020 --> 50:05.438
Definitely.

50:12.945 --> 50:14.405
Rock and roll.

50:45.559 --> 50:46.685
Why?

50:47.978 --> 50:49.396
What are you doing here?

50:49.646 --> 50:51.898
I'm fixing the sign.
What are you doing here?

50:51.982 --> 50:53.567
Taking a break.

50:54.151 --> 50:56.486
It's so weird that you just came up here.

50:56.570 --> 50:57.945
I have to tell you something.

50:58.321 --> 50:59.113
Not now, please. Please A.J., no.

50:59.155 --> 51:00.322
No, it has to be now.

51:00.406 --> 51:01.657
No, it has to be now.

51:01.741 --> 51:05.453
You remember that really horrible day
when Mark set off the store alarm...

51:05.661 --> 51:08.497
and Gina got dumped by Dennis
and cried all day...

51:08.581 --> 51:11.584
and I drew the picture of him
and Lucas made a voodoo doll...

51:11.667 --> 51:13.460
and you wore that skirt that I hate?

51:13.501 --> 51:14.669
What skirt?

51:15.045 --> 51:17.422
- The one with the flowers.
- The blue skirt?

51:17.505 --> 51:19.174
Yeah, the blue one.

51:19.341 --> 51:20.633
I hate that skirt.

51:21.051 --> 51:24.637
It's good that I hate that skirt. Listen.

51:24.929 --> 51:28.307
Listen to me.
That skirt made me realize that...

51:29.183 --> 51:31.977
if I can love her in that skirt,
then this must really be it.

51:33.062 --> 51:35.230
Corey, I love you.

51:37.524 --> 51:38.484
What?

51:39.693 --> 51:41.445
I'm in love with you.

51:42.362 --> 51:44.697
I mean, I've been in love with you.

51:44.781 --> 51:47.492
Wow, please, not now. Please, A.J.

51:48.201 --> 51:52.538
Please don't do this right now.
I'm sorry, but I can't handle this right now.

51:52.914 --> 51:55.958
Are you telling me
you could handle it some other time?

51:56.042 --> 51:57.001
Look...

51:57.210 --> 52:00.212
I just threw myself at Rex Manning, okay?

52:00.462 --> 52:03.006
And made a total fool of myself.

52:03.423 --> 52:04.382
You what?

52:04.466 --> 52:07.010
Yes, and I'm not ready for this, okay?

52:07.761 --> 52:09.054
I'm sorry.

52:13.058 --> 52:15.518
I'm sorry, I just want to be alone, okay?

52:15.851 --> 52:17.144
Yeah, okay.

52:21.482 --> 52:23.359
Forget I said anything, okay?

52:23.567 --> 52:26.529
Just forget it. I didn't say anything.
Nothing happened.

52:48.757 --> 52:49.883
Forget about Rex.

52:49.925 --> 52:52.761
- We'll get you another guy.
- I don't want another guy. I'm not like you.

52:52.845 --> 52:56.765
I don't need one.
Why do you try and make me like you?

52:57.349 --> 52:58.892
What do you mean?

53:03.354 --> 53:06.899
I'm not like you. I don't need to do
what you do all the time.

53:07.775 --> 53:09.360
Okay. I see.

53:09.527 --> 53:12.363
Not like me, the turbo slut.
Is that what you mean?

53:12.447 --> 53:15.324
Are you saying
that I've got to do every guy I see?

53:15.408 --> 53:18.034
You certainly seem to enjoy it.

53:22.247 --> 53:23.832
What did you do?

53:24.374 --> 53:27.669
Did you act all perfect
and better than everybody?

53:27.752 --> 53:29.171
You think guys like you for that?

53:29.254 --> 53:33.090
They may not like it, but at least they
don't do it with me and go off and laugh.

53:34.508 --> 53:36.760
God, you're self-righteous.

53:47.605 --> 53:50.482
There you are. Is Rex Manning in yet?

53:51.024 --> 53:54.527
If he is, show him my eight-track.
It's great. It's The Family Way.

53:54.652 --> 53:56.863
It's in the vinyl section,
right underneath the...

53:56.946 --> 53:58.072
Please!

53:58.406 --> 53:59.741
What'd I do?

54:03.912 --> 54:05.954
You forgot your thingy!

54:08.999 --> 54:11.877
It's just something
I've always been able to do.

54:12.085 --> 54:14.963
I can tell you what color and what kind.

54:15.672 --> 54:18.133
All right. What am I wearing now?

54:18.342 --> 54:19.426
Jockeys.

54:19.510 --> 54:20.885
Navy blue.

54:22.261 --> 54:23.638
Am I right?

54:23.721 --> 54:24.680
I don't know.

54:24.764 --> 54:28.142
Well, why don't you check it out
and you let me know.

54:48.537 --> 54:50.830
Now, the $64,000 question.

55:16.062 --> 55:17.772
That's really nice.

55:18.273 --> 55:19.524
Don't.

55:19.732 --> 55:21.109
Don't what?

55:21.901 --> 55:24.027
Pretend like nothing happened.

55:24.152 --> 55:26.071
Just don't.

55:27.281 --> 55:29.491
When you told me that before...

55:29.658 --> 55:31.368
I freaked because...

55:31.994 --> 55:35.872
I don't think about you like that.
You're my best friend.

55:37.124 --> 55:39.542
I think we have something
better than that.

55:39.709 --> 55:40.876
Better.

55:42.295 --> 55:43.713
That's bullshit.

55:44.297 --> 55:46.048
You know it's bullshit.

56:14.867 --> 56:17.244
One for Miss Teen America.

56:17.536 --> 56:19.204
It's okay. I didn't spit on it.

56:20.456 --> 56:22.041
"Dishonesty"?

56:22.291 --> 56:24.043
What's that supposed to mean?

56:24.251 --> 56:26.336
And one for the man with the band.

56:28.713 --> 56:30.214
"Marc sucks."

56:34.844 --> 56:38.765
Hey, A.J., I made you a button.
"Stupid."

56:38.890 --> 56:40.682
You're just in time.

56:40.807 --> 56:41.892
Please.

56:41.975 --> 56:43.352
It's a surprise.

56:44.186 --> 56:47.105
Veto! Veto!
I'm not listening to it.

56:47.189 --> 56:50.650
- No, we're dancing to it.
- No, no, no.

56:50.984 --> 56:53.695
I am not going to dance to Rex Manning.
I'm not dancing.

56:53.779 --> 56:56.947
Why not? I am Rex Manning. I'm so sexy.

56:57.031 --> 56:59.408
- No. You're stupid.
- No, I'm sexy.

56:59.492 --> 57:00.826
Get off!

57:15.256 --> 57:16.257
Wait.

57:45.952 --> 57:47.203
You all having fun?

57:48.830 --> 57:49.997
I hope so!

57:51.916 --> 57:54.627
Don't let me stop you! Keep dancing!

57:55.211 --> 57:57.046
You better do it now...

57:57.380 --> 58:01.299
because by next week
this will be a Music Town!

58:01.508 --> 58:05.595
And I don't think they allow dancing
in Music Town!

58:05.887 --> 58:08.515
What are we supposed to do instead, Joe?

58:10.392 --> 58:13.019
What am I gonna do with this guy?

58:13.561 --> 58:15.062
What should I do?

58:16.188 --> 58:17.606
Turn him into the police?

58:17.690 --> 58:19.275
Send him to jail?

58:19.525 --> 58:21.402
Who do you think he's gonna come to...

58:21.569 --> 58:23.529
when he wants bail? Who?

58:24.155 --> 58:25.239
Me, right?

58:25.364 --> 58:26.240
Me.

58:26.740 --> 58:28.117
What should I do?

58:28.826 --> 58:30.702
Put in my own $9,000?

58:30.785 --> 58:32.996
And then I'm screwed!

58:34.330 --> 58:37.041
Don't worry, Joe.
You're a superb manager.

58:38.460 --> 58:39.669
Really?

58:41.045 --> 58:42.380
Superb.

58:46.091 --> 58:47.342
Keep it up.

58:47.968 --> 58:49.344
Superb.

58:49.928 --> 58:50.888
Say it again.

58:51.263 --> 58:52.347
Superb.

58:52.931 --> 58:53.891
You shit!

58:54.183 --> 58:55.726
That's my shoulder!

58:58.270 --> 58:59.897
Get in there, pinhead!

59:02.607 --> 59:03.983
No, don't.

59:06.402 --> 59:08.070
Don't do it. Joe.

59:24.503 --> 59:26.004
You deserved that.

59:26.254 --> 59:27.214
I know.

59:29.883 --> 59:31.259
Where's Rex?

59:32.510 --> 59:35.095
Got a better question: Where's Gina?

59:44.730 --> 59:46.106
I'll look upstairs.

59:46.857 --> 59:48.274
I'll check the bathroom.

59:48.983 --> 59:50.443
I'll check in storage.

59:50.568 --> 59:51.945
I'll check the sofa.

59:54.697 --> 59:57.617
How's it going, man?
Joe, I'm sorry I'm late.

59:57.784 --> 01:00:00.245
I brought pizza, in case anyone's hungry.

01:00:00.912 --> 01:00:02.413
So, what's up, man?

01:00:02.663 --> 01:00:04.456
Why you guys looking so glum?

01:00:04.623 --> 01:00:06.333
Where's sexy Rexy?

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:08.585
It's funny that you put it that way.

01:00:10.045 --> 01:00:10.921
What?

01:00:11.505 --> 01:00:14.424
I'm not feeling so good.
Can I count out now?

01:00:19.846 --> 01:00:21.848
Why is the door locked?

01:00:22.932 --> 01:00:24.308
Where's Gina?

01:00:26.018 --> 01:00:27.311
Where's Rex?

01:00:43.451 --> 01:00:45.120
What, no applause?

01:00:49.415 --> 01:00:50.207
Get off!

01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:51.709
A.J.! A.J., stop. He's not worth it.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.173
Wise up, junior.

01:01:02.219 --> 01:01:05.221
Take your purse
and get the hell out of my store.

01:01:05.513 --> 01:01:06.598
Where's Jane?

01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:07.682
She quit.

01:01:08.141 --> 01:01:08.933
What?

01:01:09.017 --> 01:01:11.352
I lied about your hair. It looks stupid.

01:01:11.519 --> 01:01:12.937
And we all hate your new album.

01:01:13.021 --> 01:01:14.939
Not to mention the ones before that.

01:01:15.148 --> 01:01:17.025
You're a washed-up imposter.

01:01:21.236 --> 01:01:23.739
Why don't you all just fade away?

01:01:26.533 --> 01:01:28.577
How could you? With Rex Manning?

01:01:29.202 --> 01:01:30.579
I hate you.

01:01:31.371 --> 01:01:33.081
You better go home.

01:01:33.999 --> 01:01:35.375
Am I fired?

01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:39.253
Have I fired anyone today?
No. Why would I start with you?

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:46.177
Is this how your life's going to be now?
You're going to screw every has-been...

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:47.928
until your tits fall down
and they don't want you anymore?

01:01:48.012 --> 01:01:49.138
At least...

01:01:49.347 --> 01:01:53.058
I don't hide what I am.
Right, Corey?

01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:57.687
At least I'm not
some closet speed freak, right?

01:01:57.812 --> 01:02:01.274
You think I don't see what you do?
You think I don't see?

01:02:01.358 --> 01:02:03.151
- Shut up!
- I know what you do! What's this?

01:02:03.234 --> 01:02:04.694
What's this?

01:02:05.278 --> 01:02:07.571
What are these?

01:02:07.613 --> 01:02:11.408
What are these? Aspirins?
Vitamins? Breath mints?

01:02:11.575 --> 01:02:12.910
Diet pills?

01:02:13.202 --> 01:02:14.453
Diet pills?

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.830
- What a surprise!
- Stop it!

01:02:17.665 --> 01:02:21.627
You know what, I could study all night if I was chowing
down speed, too, you know that I could.

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:22.960
Here's one...

01:02:23.044 --> 01:02:24.837
...for your perfect little face!

01:02:24.921 --> 01:02:26.464
And your perfect body!

01:02:26.547 --> 01:02:29.550
And your perfect family
and your perfect school!

01:02:29.717 --> 01:02:33.096
- And your perfect, perfect future!
- Gina, stop it!

01:02:33.179 --> 01:02:34.597
I'm stopping.

01:02:34.639 --> 01:02:35.974
Come on.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.267
- I'm stopping!
- Go home.

01:02:38.725 --> 01:02:41.269
It's always about her.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.273
It'll be fine. Really.

01:02:45.357 --> 01:02:47.359
No. It's not going to be fine!

01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:51.321
Nothing's ever fine, Joe! I'll show you fine!

01:02:52.072 --> 01:02:53.573
I'll show you perfect!

01:02:53.657 --> 01:02:55.616
I hate you!

01:02:57.076 --> 01:02:58.953
I hate you!

01:03:05.751 --> 01:03:07.253
Let's get her up, come on.

01:03:10.672 --> 01:03:12.048
Better?

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.967
Come on. Let's dry you off.

01:03:25.853 --> 01:03:28.522
I guess nobody really has it all together.

01:03:29.356 --> 01:03:30.315
No.

01:03:30.524 --> 01:03:33.485
I feel like I should welcome you
to the neighborhood.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:45.747
Did you really want to do Rex Manning
in the count-out room?

01:03:46.873 --> 01:03:50.001
Is that how you always imagined
your first time would be?

01:03:50.168 --> 01:03:53.254
Your back up against the daily totals...

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.965
and your feet pounding against the safe?

01:03:56.631 --> 01:03:58.467
"Oh, Rexy, stop that!"

01:03:58.633 --> 01:04:00.010
"You're so sexy!"

01:04:07.059 --> 01:04:09.394
Why are you being so nice to me?

01:04:11.229 --> 01:04:13.314
Let's save our Hallmark moment.

01:04:35.502 --> 01:04:36.711
Hey, Mark!

01:04:40.757 --> 01:04:43.509
You love Gwar!
Why don't you join the band?

01:04:59.774 --> 01:05:02.693
Mark, man, you play a mean guitar!

01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:05.530
It's really a shame that you must die!

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:33.722
I love you, Eddie.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.732
Do you need a new night manager?

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:46.192
What are you doing later?

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:50.405
I don't know. I'm either going to jail or hell,
I can't decide which.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:55.368
Wherever you're going,
would you have dinner with me first?

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.037
You bet.

01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:04.877
Can I ask you something?

01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:07.588
Do you know where Harvard is?

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:11.633
It's near Boston.

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:14.970
No, I mean,
do you really know where Harvard is?

01:06:15.345 --> 01:06:17.430
It's another planet.

01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:21.142
Another universe, totally unlike the one we know.

01:06:21.475 --> 01:06:26.314
Filled with big blond guys
with oar boats.

01:06:27.023 --> 01:06:30.985
What I am trying to say is that you and Corey
are just not made for each other.

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:33.236
She's different than you. She's...

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.083
Death is in the cards, huh?

01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:50.127
"Rest in peace. Deb."

01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:52.922
A Funeral.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.466
Is Debra not with us anymore?

01:06:55.507 --> 01:06:59.345
If Deb wants to die, let's show her
what a real funeral would be like.

01:07:09.812 --> 01:07:13.358
We are gathered here today
to pay our last respects to Debra.

01:07:14.442 --> 01:07:16.778
She left us and never said why.

01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:19.696
But I am really going to miss her.

01:07:19.821 --> 01:07:22.574
And I wish that I could have known her
a little bit better.

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:24.076
Dogshit.

01:07:24.368 --> 01:07:26.161
Hey, dead people don't talk.

01:07:27.913 --> 01:07:29.581
- Berko, would you like to say something?
- Deb, I just...

01:07:32.626 --> 01:07:34.543
I just want you to stay.

01:07:35.253 --> 01:07:36.379
That's all.

01:07:36.462 --> 01:07:38.839
A.J., do you have something to say?

01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:43.511
Well, is it better to know or not to know?

01:07:44.679 --> 01:07:47.682
You see, I want to go to art school.

01:07:47.765 --> 01:07:49.058
But I'm afraid.

01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:51.184
Jesus, I hate this funeral.

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:57.357
Empire Records, open till midnight.
This is Mark.

01:07:57.983 --> 01:07:59.234
- Midnight?
- Yes.

01:08:07.366 --> 01:08:09.868
Help me! Help me!

01:08:12.204 --> 01:08:13.872
- I'll take care of him, boss.
- Okay.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.045
I really miss Gina.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:24.674
That's really special, but aren't we
supposed to be talking about me?

01:08:25.049 --> 01:08:27.426
I know, I just can't stop
thinking about her.

01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:31.221
She's not afraid of life,

01:08:31.346 --> 01:08:34.100
and she's not afraid to be herself.

01:08:34.934 --> 01:08:37.269
And I wish that I could be like that.

01:08:37.685 --> 01:08:39.854
I wish I could be brave like Gina.

01:08:41.898 --> 01:08:43.191
You are brave.

01:08:43.942 --> 01:08:45.277
You're getting out of here.

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:50.490
You're always talking about
how I do what I want to do...

01:08:52.616 --> 01:08:53.743
but I don't.

01:08:54.035 --> 01:08:56.578
I don't, because I want to sing in a band...

01:08:56.746 --> 01:08:58.122
...but...

01:08:58.456 --> 01:09:01.042
...I don't have the guts to even audition.

01:09:03.127 --> 01:09:06.505
And I know that if I don't do something,
I'm going to end up like my mother.

01:09:08.089 --> 01:09:11.091
Her life ended after high school.

01:09:12.176 --> 01:09:14.679
You're never going to be like your mother
if you don't want to be like her.

01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:20.643
You're going to be fine.

01:09:21.519 --> 01:09:25.147
That is so sweet, I think I'm going to barf.
Excuse me.

01:09:25.272 --> 01:09:27.107
Get down here.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.658
I used to pee in my bed.

01:09:40.036 --> 01:09:41.203
I did.

01:09:41.287 --> 01:09:43.497
I wet my bed until I was 10.

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:45.625
My mother...

01:09:45.666 --> 01:09:47.585
turned me over to the county...

01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:50.254
when I was 10, too.

01:09:50.671 --> 01:09:55.092
Not for being a bed-wetter,
but for being a bad seed.

01:09:55.842 --> 01:09:57.469
Anyway...

01:09:57.928 --> 01:09:59.346
...three years went by...

01:09:59.846 --> 01:10:01.264
and then Joe came.

01:10:02.641 --> 01:10:05.644
He took me out, and I became...

01:10:05.727 --> 01:10:08.146
the person that I am today.

01:10:13.567 --> 01:10:14.527
Look.

01:10:15.653 --> 01:10:18.614
I tried to kill myself with a Lady Bic.

01:10:18.906 --> 01:10:23.160
A pink plastic razor with daisies on it
and a moisturizing strip.

01:10:25.413 --> 01:10:28.415
And it took me forever
just to get through my skin.

01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:32.502
I don't know.

01:10:32.627 --> 01:10:34.796
I was just really tired of being invisible.

01:10:38.174 --> 01:10:39.843
We love you, Debra.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.058
Warren, get out of the store.

01:10:50.436 --> 01:10:52.563
You can't tell me what to do, A.J.

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.149
What are you doing with a gun?

01:10:55.232 --> 01:10:56.650
What do you think I'm doing?

01:10:59.569 --> 01:11:00.903
What the hell was that?

01:11:00.945 --> 01:11:02.864
- Christ!
- Holy shit, man!

01:11:02.989 --> 01:11:05.241
Why don't you let these people go?
What do you say?

01:11:05.616 --> 01:11:09.078
Good try, A.J. You trying to fool me, man?

01:11:09.203 --> 01:11:10.705
I'm not that dumb.

01:11:10.788 --> 01:11:13.248
You'll call the cops!

01:11:13.457 --> 01:11:15.292
- Warren's shooting up the place.
- My God, A.J.

01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:17.210
A.J.'s fine. Everybody stand back, okay?

01:11:17.335 --> 01:11:19.087
Jane, call 911.

01:11:20.714 --> 01:11:22.966
Do you see that, man?

01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:26.094
Wasn't that brilliant?

01:11:26.845 --> 01:11:28.429
Didn't you love that?

01:11:28.637 --> 01:11:30.639
You told me not to come back.

01:11:30.723 --> 01:11:31.599
Well, here I am.

01:11:31.682 --> 01:11:32.766
Give me the gun, Warren.

01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:34.185
I'll give you the gun.

01:11:37.104 --> 01:11:38.272
What are you doing?

01:11:38.397 --> 01:11:40.399
I wanted to have a little chat with Warren.

01:11:40.566 --> 01:11:43.068
Yeah? Have a little chat with my gun.

01:11:43.235 --> 01:11:44.861
What do you want, Warren?

01:11:44.944 --> 01:11:47.906
Stop calling me Warren! My name isn't...

01:11:48.031 --> 01:11:49.324
...fucking Warren!

01:11:49.407 --> 01:11:50.658
His name isn't Warren.

01:11:50.742 --> 01:11:53.286
- His name isn't Warren.
- You can't kill me, Warren.

01:11:53.578 --> 01:11:55.288
...I'm already dead.

01:11:55.788 --> 01:12:00.542
I talked to God. She says, "Yo, what's up?"
And she wants you to lose the gun.

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.128
You are psycho!

01:12:03.212 --> 01:12:04.838
You are psycho!

01:12:04.963 --> 01:12:07.466
What the hell is wrong with you people?

01:12:07.633 --> 01:12:11.178
You all belong in the loony bin.
Every one of you.

01:12:11.386 --> 01:12:14.640
Forget you guys. I don't need you.
You think you're so happy

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.183
...and so goddamn great...

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:19.936
...because you work
in a freaking record store.

01:12:19.977 --> 01:12:22.230
You think you're so superior.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.818
Joe, Lucas steals $9,000 from you,
and you don't do dick to him?

01:12:28.152 --> 01:12:29.987
So you going to give me a job now?

01:12:32.322 --> 01:12:33.990
So that's it, Warren?

01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:36.660
You want to work in a record store?

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:38.828
No.

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.539
I think you're lying, Warren.

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.961
He's not going to give me a job, man.

01:12:46.126 --> 01:12:47.211
How do you know?

01:12:47.294 --> 01:12:50.422
Why should he?
Why should anyone give me a job?

01:12:50.547 --> 01:12:52.132
He gave me a job.

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.727
So do I get the job?

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:11.150
Considering the fact that he's a minor
and he put blanks in the gun...

01:13:11.359 --> 01:13:12.902
there's really not a lot they can do to him.

01:13:13.319 --> 01:13:14.696
Thanks a lot, Officers.

01:13:15.071 --> 01:13:16.781
Take care, Warren. Stay out of trouble.

01:13:17.281 --> 01:13:19.199
Wait a minute.

01:13:21.785 --> 01:13:23.203
Warren, I made this for you.

01:13:24.371 --> 01:13:25.414
Wait.

01:13:25.497 --> 01:13:27.958
Can you keep it here for me?
So when I get back...

01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:29.084
Sure.

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:30.127
Thanks, man.

01:13:31.587 --> 01:13:34.213
Hey, Warren, take care of yourself.
Don't let the man get you down.

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.840
You, too, Lucas.

01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:37.049
Bye, Gina.

01:13:37.383 --> 01:13:38.926
Yeah, don't drop the soap.

01:13:39.969 --> 01:13:41.596
I got to call Mitchell.

01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:51.229
It's $1,900.

01:13:51.896 --> 01:13:53.898
- I sold my Vespa across the street.
- No.

01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:58.653
Here's $600 left over
from the Rex Manning expense account.

01:13:59.154 --> 01:14:00.238
Cool.

01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:03.074
There's about $30 from Debra's buttons.

01:14:04.074 --> 01:14:05.909
I have some money in my bag.

01:14:06.243 --> 01:14:08.037
Here's $2...

01:14:08.162 --> 01:14:10.247
and some Bazooka Joe for karma.

01:14:10.331 --> 01:14:12.708
Here's $23 from A.J.'s expense account.

01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:15.836
Maybe you can hock this, I don't know.

01:14:18.631 --> 01:14:19.922
That's...

01:14:20.131 --> 01:14:21.507
...$3,050

01:14:22.008 --> 01:14:23.176
And...

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:24.761
...$6,000 more.

01:14:26.387 --> 01:14:28.556
It's not about money, OK?

01:14:30.725 --> 01:14:32.185
I hate money.

01:14:37.898 --> 01:14:41.735
I thought I knew what I was doing,
but I didn't, okay?

01:14:43.904 --> 01:14:45.197
I give up.

01:14:51.327 --> 01:14:52.662
Call Mitchell.

01:14:53.371 --> 01:14:56.624
- I think we can work something out...
- No, now's the time, just call him.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.295
Wait a second.

01:15:01.337 --> 01:15:03.172
Wait, give me a couple of seconds.

01:15:04.799 --> 01:15:05.883
So the perpetrator...

01:15:05.966 --> 01:15:08.927
...will be taken to Juvenile Hall
and likely charged...

01:15:08.968 --> 01:15:12.347
...with assault with a deadly weapon
possibly even kidnapping.

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:15.016
I saw the whole thing go down.
You see, I work here.

01:15:15.433 --> 01:15:16.559
Hey, guys, check it out.

01:15:16.643 --> 01:15:18.144
Mark's on TV!

01:15:18.186 --> 01:15:20.480
Joining us is an eyewitness to the scene.

01:15:20.605 --> 01:15:23.107
An employee of the store who saw it.
Tell us what happened.

01:15:23.941 --> 01:15:26.860
This guy here kind of wigged out and all,
but that's besides the point.

01:15:26.944 --> 01:15:31.824
We're having a get-together here tonight.
There's gonna be free admission, live music, hits, chicks.

01:15:32.408 --> 01:15:33.701
The full nine yards, man.

01:15:33.784 --> 01:15:35.994
It'll be heavy shit. Here at midnight.

01:15:36.078 --> 01:15:37.912
We're live on the air right now.
That's the story...

01:15:40.665 --> 01:15:42.959
Anybody can come. Here at midnight.
Party on, man!

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.503
Damn the man! Save the Empire!

01:16:20.286 --> 01:16:22.037
We've got to make some money.

01:16:36.426 --> 01:16:39.970
You gotta invest in this
when you're young. A record is like life.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.680
It goes around and around.

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:44.558
- How much is it?
- $80.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.110
$5 a beer.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:56.652
Plenty for everyone!

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:58.863
There you go.

01:17:03.451 --> 01:17:05.787
You gotta buy something before you go in.

01:17:05.953 --> 01:17:08.414
- You wanna buy some vinyl or something?
- Hi, Mitchell.

01:17:14.419 --> 01:17:16.046
What is going on here?

01:17:16.213 --> 01:17:20.175
Why do I get the feeling
that I am being royally screwed?

01:17:21.635 --> 01:17:23.303
Because you are, Mitch.

01:17:24.888 --> 01:17:28.390
There was no money in the bag.
One of my employees needed it.

01:17:31.852 --> 01:17:32.895
Who took it?

01:17:35.105 --> 01:17:36.690
Who took my money?

01:17:38.818 --> 01:17:40.444
Mitch, this is some party.
I mean it's a hell of a turn-out.

01:17:40.528 --> 01:17:41.445
Who are you?

01:17:41.529 --> 01:17:45.031
- I'm Lucas. I still work here.
- How could I forget. We're talking...

01:17:45.114 --> 01:17:47.367
I wanted to talk to you
about this Music Town thing.

01:17:48.284 --> 01:17:52.497
Next week, you'll be the owner
of one of the many Music Towns...

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.665
- Across this great land, correct?
- Yes.

01:17:53.748 --> 01:17:56.626
You like it because Music Town
raises prices, so you make more money.

01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:58.085
You're a smart boy.

01:17:58.126 --> 01:18:01.630
When Music Town comes in...
Joe is out.

01:18:01.964 --> 01:18:03.298
A.J. is out.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:07.553
All the beautiful little tattooed,
gum-chewing freaks are out as well.

01:18:07.636 --> 01:18:10.597
And it pretty much goes
without saying, that I'm out.

01:18:10.722 --> 01:18:13.724
Wish it had gone without saying,
but you won't shut up.

01:18:13.808 --> 01:18:16.143
What I think Lucas is trying to say...

01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.437
...is that I'm going to open my own store.

01:18:19.856 --> 01:18:21.732
You don't have the start-up capital.

01:18:22.108 --> 01:18:24.110
- Yes, he does.
- No, I don't.

01:18:24.986 --> 01:18:26.279
But I will.

01:18:26.696 --> 01:18:28.239
I will get it.

01:18:32.325 --> 01:18:33.368
I quit.

01:18:37.455 --> 01:18:38.540
You knew, didn't you?

01:18:38.623 --> 01:18:39.541
About what?

01:18:39.624 --> 01:18:40.876
Everything.

01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:43.169
About me,
what I wanted to do.

01:18:43.795 --> 01:18:45.671
I knew you weren't happy.

01:19:54.527 --> 01:19:57.238
Thank you for coming. 'Bye. Move along.

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.407
These are on sale with a coupon, right?

01:20:12.086 --> 01:20:14.630
Doesn't anybody work in this store?

01:20:15.005 --> 01:20:16.048
I do.

01:20:23.888 --> 01:20:25.390
A.J.!

01:20:49.203 --> 01:20:53.749
Leave the merchandise, take your cup,
get out! Bug someone outside!

01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:54.959
Now!

01:20:55.835 --> 01:20:58.004
Here's all your money. Count it.

01:21:02.007 --> 01:21:04.593
I hate this place. You love it.

01:21:04.968 --> 01:21:06.636
Let me sell it to you.

01:21:07.679 --> 01:21:09.097
Cheap.

01:21:09.848 --> 01:21:11.808
Thanks, you won't regret it.

01:21:13.143 --> 01:21:15.061
Asshole.

01:21:16.563 --> 01:21:17.897
I'll take it.

01:21:18.023 --> 01:21:20.024
Give me that!

01:21:23.986 --> 01:21:24.820
You!

01:21:25.529 --> 01:21:26.613
- Take the lead.
- What?

01:21:26.864 --> 01:21:27.823
Go on.

01:21:28.949 --> 01:21:30.284
You're on.

01:22:29.923 --> 01:22:31.007
Perfect.

01:22:33.551 --> 01:22:36.221
Well, not entirely perfect.

01:22:42.351 --> 01:22:44.686
Hi. What are you doing up here?

01:22:44.853 --> 01:22:46.271
- Listen to me!
- Hello, Corey.

01:22:46.438 --> 01:22:48.774
You're so special and so talented!

01:22:48.899 --> 01:22:51.443
You have everything it takes!
More than everything it takes!

01:22:51.568 --> 01:22:55.238
And you're really stupid
because you don't know that!

01:22:56.739 --> 01:23:00.326
And I know you don't love me anymore
and I know that I blew it!

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:02.161
And if you don't go to art school...

01:23:02.245 --> 01:23:05.790
if you don't understand how special
you are, then you know nothing.

01:23:08.793 --> 01:23:10.877
I did love you and I still...

01:23:11.169 --> 01:23:14.297
Only I didn't realize it was love
because it was more than love...

01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:17.759
and it wasn't just some stupid feeling
in my stomach.

01:23:17.843 --> 01:23:19.886
I'll never love anybody as much as you.

01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:22.889
And I hate you! Why did you wait so long?

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.432
I quit.

01:23:27.518 --> 01:23:29.270
I'm going to art school...

01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:32.356
in Boston...

01:23:32.523 --> 01:23:34.233
so I can be near you.

01:23:36.902 --> 01:23:38.112
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:27:00.885 --> 01:27:03.762
That guy, whatever his name is.

01:27:04.012 --> 01:27:05.722
What's his name?

01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:08.933
That dude with the shaved head?
The liar guy?

01:27:09.351 --> 01:27:12.187
- Henry Rollins?
- Yes, the guy with tattoos all over.

01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:14.356
I admit, Henry Rollins is sort of a puss.

01:27:14.439 --> 01:27:16.858
Yeah, he's a total puss. His lyrics suck.

01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:20.152
But you can't go and put down the Misfits.

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:22.946
They had everything it took
to be a great punk band.

01:27:23.197 --> 01:27:26.909
They had good bass lines
and strong guitar chords...

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:28.660
even though they were only three.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:33.457
They didn't even compare to Primus.
They were that old school stuff.

01:27:33.499 --> 01:27:35.374
Why get into Primus?

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:37.960
- Primus sucks.
- Primus is the new stuff.

01:27:38.169 --> 01:27:40.213
Out with the old, in with the new.

01:27:40.296 --> 01:27:43.424
Religion's a bad thing if Primus
is what's gonna come around.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:46.969
- What are you talking about?
- The fact that Primus has nothing.

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:49.097
They got good bass lines. I'll admit.

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.973
They have beautiful bass lines.
Six-string fretless bass...

01:27:52.015 --> 01:27:54.643
Okay, but they're not
as good as the Pixies.

01:27:54.851 --> 01:27:59.022
The Pixies have way better bass lines
than Primus.

01:27:59.064 --> 01:28:01.358
So why didn't they stick around?

01:28:01.525 --> 01:28:05.278
Because people wanted to do solo careers
and explore themselves...

01:28:05.528 --> 01:28:08.364
as single entities instead of a band.

01:28:09.865 --> 01:28:11.784
But that's like money.

01:28:11.867 --> 01:28:15.412
No, it's not about money.
What are you talking about, "money"?

01:28:15.663 --> 01:28:16.622
Yeah, it is.

01:28:20.918 --> 01:28:22.293
and everything's going to be fine...
