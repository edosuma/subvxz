00:11.959 --> 00:13.208
I hate to admit this,
Gamby, but,

00:13.208 --> 00:15.125
(SIGHS) I don't know
that I have what it takes.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.458
There's a full-on revolt coming.

00:18.166 --> 00:21.041
You're a loser who commands
no respect whatsoever.

00:21.625 --> 00:22.417
I respect him.

00:22.417 --> 00:23.500
This school has had worse.

00:23.709 --> 00:24.750
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

00:24.750 --> 00:26.166
RUSSELL:
You need to bring a hot date.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.500
Show Snodgrass you're over it.

00:27.792 --> 00:29.000
I have a master plan.

00:29.291 --> 00:31.041
Think you should just keep
searching around

00:31.041 --> 00:32.333
for a publisher
that's more suitable.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.583
One that has
a full head of hair.

00:33.583 --> 00:34.417
Oh!

00:34.667 --> 00:36.375
-What has gotten into you?
-KEVIN: Hey guys...

00:36.375 --> 00:38.417
CHRISTINE: In college,
when Kevin and I were dating,

00:38.417 --> 00:39.500
you said he was gay.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.917
Stop making up lies.

00:41.917 --> 00:42.875
RUSSELL:
Don't-- (SCREAMS)

00:42.875 --> 00:44.333
D'you like my little present?

00:45.291 --> 00:46.166
(GUESTS GASPING)

00:46.166 --> 00:47.458
I roofied in his drink.

00:47.458 --> 00:48.417
You wanna go back to my place?

00:48.667 --> 00:49.458
Yep.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.792
(gate buzzing)

01:13.166 --> 01:14.959
Why are you alone?
Where's Russell?

01:14.959 --> 01:16.458
Couldn't make it.

01:16.458 --> 01:18.542
I think he had
to work on his marriage.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.291
What the fuck?
Russell's supposed to be here!

01:21.291 --> 01:23.083
I always
show up for his shit.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.542
I'm getting sick and tired
of him being so goddamn selfish.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.959
Well, I've been doing
some digging on my own,

01:27.959 --> 01:29.834
and I think I might
have cracked the case.

01:29.834 --> 01:32.667
Statistics show
the prep is usually

01:32.667 --> 01:34.041
someone who's close to you.

01:34.041 --> 01:37.500
Perhaps someone you were
romantically involved with.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.834
My guess:
it's your ex-wife Gale.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.333
Yeah.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.041
Jesus Christ! Look...

01:44.041 --> 01:46.458
I know you've expressed
an interest in helping me
solve my case,

01:46.458 --> 01:48.542
and I have indulged that,
but this is hopeless.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.041
Come on, boss, no.
We can solve this case.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.875
Case is closed. Russell
doesn't even show up anymore.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.583
What the fuck, Gamby?

01:59.583 --> 02:02.250
We were just hanging out.
We're just friends.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.667
Uh, none of my business, boss.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.500
You're goddamn right, Nash.
Okay, zip your lips.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.875
You didn't see
a goddamn thing here.

02:07.875 --> 02:10.625
Hey, Nash, you know
what you saw.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.709
We're in love.

02:13.917 --> 02:15.000
No, we're not.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.709
(theme music playing)

02:33.041 --> 02:35.083
Could I have a biscuit, please?

02:45.750 --> 02:48.375
Babydoll, this is no way
for a married couple to live.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.166
I agree.
Well, if you agree,

02:50.166 --> 02:52.083
then why aren't you following
the therapist's advice?

02:52.083 --> 02:54.333
We're supposed
to be communicating.

02:54.333 --> 02:55.667
Dr. Portino also said

02:55.667 --> 02:57.875
that we should be practicing
unconditional honesty.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.750
Fine. Honesty Check.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.959
These scrambled eggs
are hard as hell,
and they taste wretched.

03:02.959 --> 03:06.000
See? Honesty is not
always the best policy.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.959
Nope. It is
the best policy. Always.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.125
I can keep going.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.542
Honesty check.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.125
I still have
anger towards you.

03:13.125 --> 03:15.291
In fact,
I cursed your name earlier

03:15.291 --> 03:17.333
when I was masturbating
in the shower and secretly hoped

03:17.333 --> 03:19.583
that we wouldn't have
to see each other this morning.

03:19.583 --> 03:21.375
Okay. My turn.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.083
Honesty check.
Let's go. Bring it on.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.583
I didn't want
to see you either.

03:24.583 --> 03:28.083
I stayed in the shower
hoping you'd be gone
by the time I got out.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.458
Look at us.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.750
Just a couple
of honest Abes

03:36.750 --> 03:38.250
working it the fuck out.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.125
See? It's better
to tell the truth,

03:40.125 --> 03:41.875
even if it is
uncomfortable sometimes.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.709
Can I be honest
with Mi-Cha, too?

03:43.709 --> 03:45.041
You should be
honest with everyone.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.750
Mi-Cha, you look
like death warmed over.

03:47.750 --> 03:51.834
Every time I look at you,
I lose my fucking appetite.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.291
Goddamn!

03:53.291 --> 03:54.500
Woo! That felt good!

03:54.500 --> 03:55.750
(speaks Korean)

03:55.750 --> 03:57.959
This is what we should
have been doing all along.

03:57.959 --> 04:02.208
You know what else?
I honestly want to cook
you dinner tonight.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.625
Would you let me do that?

04:03.625 --> 04:05.375
Since when do you cook?

04:05.375 --> 04:07.417
I learned from one
of the best, Betty Crocker.

04:07.417 --> 04:09.959
(laughs) Honesty check.

04:09.959 --> 04:13.875
Okay. Sure. It's a date.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.625
A date.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.458
Date?
You can be there too
because I love you.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.750
Gamby:
And I just want to thank
everyone who donated their time.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.500
It was really appreciated.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.917
Now, thanks to you,

04:28.917 --> 04:32.083
the 4H Club's future
is so bright...

04:32.083 --> 04:34.208
they gotta wear shades.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.458
(laughing)

04:36.458 --> 04:39.667
Thank you. You guys
have been great. Thank you.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.166
Woo! Yeah!

04:43.917 --> 04:45.834
You'll have
to forgive Gamby.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.500
I think he might
have hit his head.

04:47.500 --> 04:51.000
He thinks he's in a comedy club
in Greenwich Village.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.291
You know, like, uh,
like Whoopi Goldberg?

04:54.291 --> 04:56.375
Something like that?

04:56.375 --> 04:58.542
You know who
I'm talking about.

04:58.542 --> 05:01.208
So, uh, anyway,

05:01.208 --> 05:03.083
it's that time of year again,

05:03.083 --> 05:05.333
for the High School
Assessment Program.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.166
And you know what that means.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.667
The students get to take a test
that doesn't really matter.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.333
(laughing)

05:11.333 --> 05:13.875
Oh, oh, really. That gets
a laugh? Okay, whatever.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.583
Uh, no, Regina, actually,

05:15.583 --> 05:17.208
how the kids score on the HSAPs

05:17.208 --> 05:19.250
affects our funding for
the year, so it means a lot.

05:19.250 --> 05:23.792
Now I'm gonna need some of you
to volunteer to be proctors
for the test.

05:23.792 --> 05:26.250
Shouldn't tests
be about learning?

05:26.250 --> 05:27.667
It is, Mr. Milner.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.959
It's about the district learning
what an effective school we are

05:29.959 --> 05:31.792
and what an awesome
fucking principal I am.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.500
(blows raspberry)
(laughing)

05:33.500 --> 05:34.583
What the fuck?

05:35.583 --> 05:37.083
Hey, man, why you
trying to throw shade?

05:37.083 --> 05:38.166
Ain't nobody throwing shade.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.542
Why don't you
continue with your story.

05:39.542 --> 05:41.750
You're acting like
a dictator, Russell.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.208
Shove it up your
tight little ass, Martin!

05:43.208 --> 05:44.959
Just for that,
you know what you are?

05:44.959 --> 05:46.166
You're a goddamn proctor now.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.166
Say something else.
Come on, say it.

05:48.166 --> 05:50.417
I'll outlaw fucking
scarves in this school.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.750
Now the HSAPs are coming,

05:52.750 --> 05:55.375
and we're gonna prep for 'em
like our life depended on it.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.166
Dismissed.

05:57.166 --> 06:00.250
Except for you.

06:02.417 --> 06:03.417
What the fuck?

06:03.417 --> 06:05.208
How dare you undermine me

06:05.208 --> 06:06.917
to score points
with these teachers.

06:06.917 --> 06:08.250
How dare you stand me up

06:08.250 --> 06:10.125
when you're supposed to be
helping with my investigation.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.750
I told you, I have
more important things
going on in my life

06:12.750 --> 06:14.250
than your stupid fucking case!

06:14.250 --> 06:15.667
Uh... Say again?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.625
That came out wrong, Gamby.
I didn't mean that.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.166
I think that came out exactly
how you wanted it to,

06:20.166 --> 06:21.875
and I don't appreciate it.

06:21.875 --> 06:24.458
Smooth move, Ex-Lax.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.291
Smell you later.

06:26.291 --> 06:29.458
Gamby. Gamby...

06:34.208 --> 06:36.333
So then the guy
licks his finger,

06:36.333 --> 06:37.834
gets a weird look
on his face,

06:37.834 --> 06:39.208
then looks at
the girl and says,

06:39.208 --> 06:41.625
"Sweetheart, that ain't
marinara sauce."

06:41.625 --> 06:44.709
(laughing)

06:44.709 --> 06:45.750
Oh, nasty.

06:45.750 --> 06:48.792
You are so good
at joke-telling,

06:48.792 --> 06:49.834
it's not even funny.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.709
I mean, it is funny,
obviously.

06:51.709 --> 06:52.959
Super funny.
So, Gamby,

06:52.959 --> 06:54.834
you're still up for payday
drinks this week, right?

06:54.834 --> 06:56.083
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.333
You'll up the fun quotient
by double digits, at least.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.834
Well, I hope to.

06:59.834 --> 07:00.959
(laughs)

07:00.959 --> 07:02.417
But no marinara sauce.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.208
(laughing)

07:04.208 --> 07:05.667
You guys have been
a wonderful audience,

07:05.667 --> 07:06.917
but somebody here's
got to work.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.250
I'm out.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.542
(laughing)

07:09.542 --> 07:11.166
Enjoy the rest of
your day, teachers.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.500
See you so soon.
Yeah,

07:12.500 --> 07:14.041
you will.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.625
Did you guys hear that?
What?

07:15.625 --> 07:17.709
I said, I'll see you soon,
he was like, "Yeah, you will."

07:17.709 --> 07:19.709
I think he likes you...

07:19.709 --> 07:20.875
Duh.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.417
Dayshawn, Dayshawn, Dayshawn.

07:23.417 --> 07:24.959
Damn, Mr. Gamby.

07:24.959 --> 07:27.500
I see you over there straight
chilling with the teachers, huh?
Oh yeah.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.500
I recall the time your ass was
afraid to even sit over there.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.041
Pssh. So true.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.709
I can hardly believe
it myself, huh.

07:33.709 --> 07:35.375
I'm actually becoming popular.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.500
Tell you what, man,
I'm fucking impressed.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.875
You know, I got to make sure
I don't forget who I really am.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.542
But it's so crazy.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.041
Yeah, you don't want
to get too cocky.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.542
Got to be real.
Yeah.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.333
You see those kids over there?
Yeah.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.542
That used to be me.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.208
A nerd. A nobody.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.709
Bottom of the barrel.

07:50.709 --> 07:54.125
But now, I think
I'm more like those guys.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.834
Oh, you more like Aiden Miller
and them cool motherfuckers?

07:56.834 --> 07:58.041
That's who you think you are?

07:58.041 --> 07:59.417
That's who I know I am.

07:59.417 --> 08:00.667
All right.
I'm a tastemaker.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.834
An alpha, Dayshawn.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.375
When I say something,
people listen.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.000
When I crack a joke,
people laugh.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.291
It's like night and day, buddy.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.834
That's fucking beautiful, man.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.542
Congratulations, Mr. Gamby.

08:09.542 --> 08:12.667
You thinking about sticking
with that haircut?

08:12.667 --> 08:14.041
Yeah. Why would
I change my hair?

08:14.041 --> 08:16.000
I just thought
with you being
a tastemaker now,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.125
you might want
to switch to something
a little more dope, man,

08:18.125 --> 08:21.041
instead of that
Mike Ditka, Happy Days
shit you got going on.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.083
This is actually
a pretty dope haircut
for a white person.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.458
Well, I'm not trying to offend
you or any other white people,

08:25.458 --> 08:27.375
but you look like
a very low-level mobster.

08:27.375 --> 08:30.375
Uh, well, I don't really think
that that's a negative.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.250
So... whatever.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.583
Gamby:
If I'm going to fit in
at payday drinks,

08:34.583 --> 08:37.250
I'm gonna need some advice
on how to dress like you people.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.667
I was wondering
why you dragged
my ass to the mall.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.542
Can I get something
pretty, too?

08:41.542 --> 08:42.709
If you use your own money.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.166
Neal...
(laughs)

08:44.166 --> 08:45.625
What the hell
are you doing?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.709
Don't be embarrassed.
You can put your hand
on my ass too.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.250
Get your hand out
of my pocket, right now.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.667
Neal, look, I know
you want to keep
our relationship a secret,

08:51.667 --> 08:55.083
but I'm the second or third
most popular teacher
at North Jackson.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.875
I can be your gateway
to the in-crowd.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.875
Uh-uh. All I need from you
are fashion tips, okay?

08:58.875 --> 09:01.375
Besides clothing, I already
got their acceptance.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.417
Yeah, well, if you want
to be principal,

09:03.417 --> 09:04.542
you need more than
acceptance.

09:04.542 --> 09:05.959
Russell's principal.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.959
Yeah, but if Russell
wasn't around,

09:07.959 --> 09:09.250
then you would
be principal.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.959
Well, I highly doubt
Russell's going anywhere.

09:10.959 --> 09:14.250
Neal... you have
so much potential.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.500
You're like a diamond
in the rough and...

09:16.500 --> 09:20.959
I want to be the one
to scrape off all that
gross black stuff.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.125
Popularity is like war.

09:25.125 --> 09:29.000
There are certain
rules of engagement.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.166
♪ ♪

09:33.166 --> 09:34.750
Rule number one:

09:34.750 --> 09:37.417
populars have their
own sense of style.

09:37.417 --> 09:39.208
Image is everything.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.792
What do you think about this?

09:40.792 --> 09:43.250
A few small improvements...

09:45.500 --> 09:48.291
Yeah, that's better.
Fucking hot.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.959
Hey! You can't do that.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.125
I was just making it cool.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.417
You're destroying merchandise.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.208
I don't even think
this is my style.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.166
Rule number two:
forget what you think.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.792
Being popular
is about accepting
what everyone else thinks.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.667
Image is everything.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.959
Image is everything.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.333
Image is everything.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.166
Neal Gamby,

10:05.166 --> 10:07.041
the most popular
boy in school.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.500
Can you see it?

10:13.875 --> 10:14.959
Mm.

10:14.959 --> 10:17.000
So? Honesty check.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.709
Did you like it?

10:18.709 --> 10:20.125
Delicious.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.333
Who knew you could cook?

10:21.333 --> 10:23.083
Well, it looks
like Mi-Cha
enjoyed it.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.083
She's going bananas
over there.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.417
Go ahead, soak it up,
gravy's the best part.

10:27.417 --> 10:28.709
Yeah.

10:28.709 --> 10:31.333
Uh, no-no-no.
Don't... you don't
do it with your tongue...

10:31.333 --> 10:33.542
in America, we use bread.

10:33.542 --> 10:35.208
We use bread.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.417
Here you go.

10:36.417 --> 10:37.792
My one and only
mother-in-law.

10:37.792 --> 10:40.583
This is great. You have
to make it more often.
What's in it?

10:40.583 --> 10:43.375
No way, I will not
divulge the secret recipe.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.542
You cannot even get me
with an honesty check.

10:45.542 --> 10:47.291
I mean it, Christine.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.041
(laughing)

10:49.041 --> 10:50.959
This was nice, Lee.

10:50.959 --> 10:52.333
Thank you.

10:53.291 --> 10:56.041
I love you, Christine.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.500
Our marriage is sacred.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.792
I will do honesty checks.
I'll cook dinner.

11:00.792 --> 11:03.542
I'll even walk over
hot coals to save it.

11:04.875 --> 11:07.208
God's honest truth, baby.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.709
I'll do the dishes.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.458
Okay.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.625
(speaking Korean)

11:18.166 --> 11:19.959
Thank you.

11:37.083 --> 11:40.083
Lee?

11:41.709 --> 11:43.458
You rang?

11:43.458 --> 11:46.083
How long did it take you
to cook dinner?

11:46.083 --> 11:51.000
Uh... I don't know.
Like an hour,
an hour I guess?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.625
For all this?

11:52.625 --> 11:55.000
Well, I didn't time it,
Christine.

12:02.709 --> 12:05.125
If you had just said,
let's get takeout,

12:05.125 --> 12:07.083
I would've been totally fine.

12:07.083 --> 12:10.875
I tried... to cook, Christine.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.500
But I-I-I burned the chicken.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.792
Show me the chicken.
Well, I don't have
the burned chicken, Christine,

12:15.792 --> 12:16.959
because I threw it away.

12:16.959 --> 12:19.208
Once I got the-the takeout,
I threw it away.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.917
I was trying to cover
my tracks, Christine.

12:20.917 --> 12:22.625
What were
the ingredients? Quick.
What are you...?

12:22.625 --> 12:25.750
Christine, come on,
I'm a principal
of a high school--

12:25.750 --> 12:29.166
You lie and then
you tell more lies
to cover everything up,

12:29.166 --> 12:31.083
even when you're
doing something nice.

12:31.083 --> 12:36.333
Why are you doing this?
We just had a beautiful dinner.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.500
No, I didn't, I didn't cook,

12:39.500 --> 12:42.375
but isn't it the thought
that counts?

12:42.375 --> 12:44.375
Hey, hey, come on.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.834
Don't do that.
Don't do this.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.792
Hey-hey, come on.
Come on, don't-don't.
Stop it.

12:47.792 --> 12:49.792
Don't do that. Come on.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.625
Gale:
So we'll be
to the school by six PM,

12:56.625 --> 12:58.166
if that works.
Yeah.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.333
And if it doesn't work--

12:59.333 --> 13:00.917
Well, this is a little bit
of an inconvenience.

13:00.917 --> 13:03.959
Janelle, don't leave
your bookbag at
my house again, okay?

13:03.959 --> 13:05.417
Keep up with your stuff.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.709
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.333
What are you wearing?

13:09.333 --> 13:11.291
What are you talking about?
This is a linen suit.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.500
I dig it, Gamby.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.875
You got sort of
a Max Headroom
thing going on.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.083
You look... ridiculous.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.709
Pssh. Says the woman with
blue hair and yoga pants.

13:19.709 --> 13:22.291
Get a clue, Gale.
Image is everything.

13:22.291 --> 13:24.792
Hey, can we get pizza
after my thing tonight?

13:24.792 --> 13:26.041
Tonight,
what's tonight?

13:26.041 --> 13:28.125
J Bird won an extinct
animal art contest.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.667
Yeah, I'm getting an award.

13:29.667 --> 13:32.625
Aw, shit baby. I can't make it.
I got payday drinks tonight.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.417
Gale: So what?
So what?

13:34.417 --> 13:37.083
Payday drinks is
a very important
social engagement.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.709
I've never been asked before.
It's a real honor.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.208
Can't you just miss it?

13:41.208 --> 13:42.625
(sighs) Baby.

13:42.625 --> 13:47.000
Look. If I can kick ass
tonight at payday drinks,

13:47.000 --> 13:50.458
it's my one shot to be
the most popular boy
in the whole school.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.000
The most popular boy?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.542
Person, whatever Gale.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.125
Don't make fun of me,
all right?

13:55.125 --> 13:57.458
Look, if I ever want
to be principal again,
I got to be popular.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.750
Wish you guys could
be supportive and
understand that.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.542
Hume said "Patriotism
and popularity

14:02.542 --> 14:04.291
are the beaten road
to power and tyranny."

14:04.291 --> 14:07.542
See? I knew Ray
would understand.

14:08.458 --> 14:09.917
Check it, check it.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.667
Each of you have been
chosen to be the proctors
for the HSAPs.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.250
Now I know none of you all
want to be here.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.583
I don't want to be here either.

14:15.583 --> 14:18.250
I'll try to keep it chill
as poss... possible.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.750
Now once the tests
are completed,

14:19.750 --> 14:22.500
you will gather them,
and you will deliver
them to me and Nash-O.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.041
We will then place
the tests into bins

14:25.041 --> 14:27.208
that will be delivered
securely by Ms. Snodgrass,

14:27.208 --> 14:29.583
to the school board,
no later than three PM.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.166
Do no tamper with the tests,

14:31.166 --> 14:32.667
or you could face jail time.

14:32.667 --> 14:35.583
Yikes. They'd throw me
in teacher jail?

14:35.583 --> 14:37.250
No, Ms. Snodgrass.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.166
State, federal,
fucking prison.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.000
So don't fuck around.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.125
Do you guys want to get
your packets now?

14:44.250 --> 14:47.125
Gamby, looking forward
to payday drinks tonight?

14:47.125 --> 14:48.750
Should be a fairly
fly affair, huh?

14:48.750 --> 14:49.875
First time you've been, huh?

14:49.875 --> 14:52.041
Of course you'd try
to shine a light on that.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.625
You buzzkill.
No.

14:53.625 --> 14:56.125
Hater's going to hate.
Hater's going to hate.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.000
The problem with him is,
you need to walk and talk.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.625
You need to be able
to walk and talk.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.625
Hello, friends.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.583
What's going on?

15:11.583 --> 15:13.500
Deets:
Oh, I got that thing.
Seychelles: Oh, yeah.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.959
I got to go do.
Oh yeah. I got to go.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.083
Seychelles:
See ya.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.625
Yo. I just wanted to give
you the heads-up

15:27.625 --> 15:29.959
that the proctors are all
set for the HSAPs tomorrow.

15:29.959 --> 15:33.333
Hey, that's, uh...
really cool ensemble.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.625
I know. Thank you.

15:35.625 --> 15:38.333
Also, Gamby, I was
thinking about some...

15:38.333 --> 15:40.917
some suspects, you know,
in your case, and, uh--

15:40.917 --> 15:42.333
Russell, don't try
to be my friend.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.834
You don't care about
the case, so don't
act like you do.

15:44.834 --> 15:46.041
I was just trying
to be nice.

15:46.041 --> 15:48.000
I got to split.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.291
Teachers invited me to PDD.

15:49.291 --> 15:52.834
Oh, you got invited
to payday drinks?

15:52.834 --> 15:55.834
(scoffs) Please.
I used to go all the time.

15:55.834 --> 15:58.750
A bunch of teachers sitting
around eating nachos
and singing karaoke?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.834
What an absolute joke.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.208
I like eating nachos
and lip-synching,

16:03.208 --> 16:04.291
I always have.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.417
Oh, well good.

16:05.417 --> 16:06.667
I hope you enjoy them.

16:06.667 --> 16:09.208
I'm sure you will
as fucking fat as you are.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.417
Fuck you, Russell.

16:10.417 --> 16:11.500
Pssh.

16:12.583 --> 16:15.583
Fine, I'm jealous.
All right?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.500
The teachers,
they hate my guts.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.166
And they love you
and your...

16:20.166 --> 16:21.917
Is that what you
want to hear?

16:21.917 --> 16:23.917
I said it,
so there you go.
You got it.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.709
Put it in your wallet.
You can have it.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.709
Come on, man.
It's not that big of a deal.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.041
It's just payday drinks.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.041
I used to be the most
likeable motherfucker
in town, Gamby.

16:36.041 --> 16:39.166
Now I can't even get
my own wife to be my friend.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.250
I would invite you, but you
know how the teachers are.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.417
They like to keep
the guest list low
for payday drinks,

16:43.417 --> 16:45.834
so they can get
that good table.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.625
Go on, have a good
time, Gamby.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.000
(sighs)

16:51.000 --> 16:53.375
Fuck it. Come with me.

Buenas noches, amigo.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.458
Hey, listen.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.542
When I said you hadn't been
to payday drinks before,

17:24.542 --> 17:27.208
and, uh, you got
all upset, um,

17:27.208 --> 17:28.709
I didn't mean anything by it.

17:28.709 --> 17:30.959
I didn't think you cared
about this kind of stuff,
that's all.

17:30.959 --> 17:32.291
Being popular
is very important

17:32.291 --> 17:34.291
if I hope to get the things
I desire in this world.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.500
Image is everything.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.458
Wow.

17:37.458 --> 17:38.875
You seem so different.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.208
You never struck me as
someone who needed to fit in.

17:41.208 --> 17:42.875
Well, there's plenty
of people that

17:42.875 --> 17:45.542
think that being cool
suits me just fine.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.250
Where's your old man?

17:47.250 --> 17:48.959
He too good
for payday drinks?

17:48.959 --> 17:51.417
He's in, uh, South America.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.166
He's working on
another novel.

17:53.166 --> 17:55.000
(scoffs)
Jesus, of course he is.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.458
I guess he is getting
the real deal Mexican
food down there, huh?

17:57.458 --> 18:00.917
Well no, because Mexico
is in North America.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.333
Well, somebody better
tell the Mexicans

18:03.333 --> 18:05.041
'cause they think
they are in South America.

18:05.041 --> 18:07.667
(cheers, applause)

18:16.750 --> 18:19.667
Guys, tonight I'd like
to make an announcement.

18:19.667 --> 18:24.000
I have never been happier
than I am right now.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.792
And, uh, I can get
pretty sad and weird,

18:26.792 --> 18:29.208
I swear. I just want you
all to know that...

18:29.208 --> 18:32.625
uh, this is me doing
good for once.

18:32.625 --> 18:35.000
And, uh, I can't hold
it in any longer.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
But you should. You should.
You should hold it in.
