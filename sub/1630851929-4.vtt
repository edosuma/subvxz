<i>It's only, like,
the most popular</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:14.180

00:14.222 --> 00:15.598
<i>I'll text you my top five.</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:18.268
<i>Yeah, man, look at this shit.</i>

00:18.309 --> 00:20.186
<i>-Who's Ethan?</i>

00:20.228 --> 00:22.022
<i>That ball sack over there.</i>

00:22.063 --> 00:23.356
<i>I've always fantasized</i>

00:23.398 --> 00:24.524
<i>about hurting Zach like that.</i>

00:24.566 --> 00:26.192
<i>Leave Ethan alone.</i>

<i>Somebody committed an attack,

00:36.411 --> 00:38.038

<i>Search dogs?</i>

00:39.622 --> 00:41.207
<i>You have to move Matt's body.</i>

<i>Those dogs are gonna
walk a straight line</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:45.003
<i>from the crime scene
to your firepit.</i>

00:51.593 --> 00:54.721
<i>-Did you hear my news?
- No. What's the news?</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:56.723
<i>He's alive.</i>

00:56.765 --> 00:58.808
<i>Matty's alive.</i>

00:58.850 --> 01:00.894
<i>That's unbelievable.</i>

01:09.402 --> 01:12.530
<i>What's your theory?</i>

01:12.572 --> 01:14.574
<i>He couldn't face that
his son was dead,</i>

01:14.616 --> 01:17.160
<i>so he had some
sort of delusion.</i>

01:17.202 --> 01:20.163
I don't think so.
He's lying.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.582
<i>-Why?
- He doesn't trust the cops.</i>

01:22.624 --> 01:25.043
<i>Wants to take matters
into his own hands.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.544
<i>That's what you would do.</i>

01:26.586 --> 01:28.213
<i>Kurt's nothing like me.</i>

01:28.254 --> 01:31.549
<i>Do you remember how
enraged he was</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:33.134
<i>when he saw the video
of the other person</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:36.096
<i>out there in the woods?</i>

01:36.137 --> 01:40.100
<i>Yeah, he thought
it was a Seneca.</i>

01:40.141 --> 01:44.771
<i>He thinks that Johnny Bullhorn
murdered Matt</i>

01:44.813 --> 01:48.441
<i>for shooting the deer,</i>

01:48.483 --> 01:52.112
<i>and Angela is protecting him.</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:58.827
<i>So he gets Angela
to close down the case,</i>

01:58.868 --> 02:01.496
<i>waits for things to cool off...</i>

02:01.538 --> 02:03.915
<i>and bam, he kills Johnny.</i>

02:03.957 --> 02:05.625
<i>Kurt goes to jail.</i>

02:07.627 --> 02:11.256
<i>All because of... you.</i>

02:11.297 --> 02:14.467
<i>-It could be worse.
- Worse?</i>

02:14.509 --> 02:16.761
<i>Once the small-town cops
are out of the way,</i>

02:16.803 --> 02:19.430
<i>Kurt does due diligence
onto Johnny,</i>

02:19.472 --> 02:22.392
<i>and he realizes
he couldn't have done it.</i>

02:22.433 --> 02:24.811
<i>So he keeps digging</i>

02:24.853 --> 02:27.355
<i>all the way...</i>

02:30.441 --> 02:33.403
<i>...to his son's real killer.</i>

02:44.205 --> 02:45.373
<i>Hey there.</i>

02:45.415 --> 02:47.125
<i>Did you hear the news?</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:48.334
<i>About Matt?</i>

02:48.376 --> 02:50.128
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:52.630
<i>I was right in the first place.
He just skipped town.</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:54.507
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:54.549 --> 02:56.176
<i>Well, who'd you hear it from?</i>

02:56.217 --> 02:58.553
<i>Uh... Kurt.</i>

02:59.554 --> 03:01.264
<i>You talked to Kurt?</i>

03:01.306 --> 03:03.641
<i>Yeah, it was late,
so I had to get groceries</i>

03:03.683 --> 03:07.770
<i>for Harrison at that 24-hour
market in Moose Creek.</i>

03:07.812 --> 03:10.857
<i>And on my way home, I saw Kurt
coming out of The Tavern.</i>

03:10.899 --> 03:12.442
<i>He looked like he'd had
one too many,</i>

03:12.483 --> 03:15.820
<i>so I gave him a ride home.
He was celebrating.</i>

03:15.862 --> 03:17.113
<i>Hey, Chief!</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:20.700
<i>You were right all along.</i>

03:20.742 --> 03:22.285
<i>Um, I got to go.</i>

03:22.327 --> 03:23.661
<i>I'll talk to you later.
I love you.</i>

03:23.703 --> 03:26.039
<i>Okay. Love you, too.</i>

03:32.921 --> 03:34.547
<i>Morning, buddy.</i>

03:34.589 --> 03:37.091
<i>-You want some breakfast?
- I got it.</i>

03:40.220 --> 03:42.513
<i>Made the team.</i>

03:42.555 --> 03:44.849
<i>Coach Logan says
I have to gain five pounds</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:47.060
<i>before the first match.</i>

03:47.101 --> 03:49.187
<i>That's great.
You're making friends.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:53.358
<i>Eh. Most of the guys
on the team are fuck-nuggets.</i>

03:56.069 --> 03:57.237
<i>What?</i>

03:57.278 --> 03:59.030
<i>Your Aunt Deb used to
say that.</i>

03:59.072 --> 04:00.073
<i>Fuck-nuggets.</i>

04:00.114 --> 04:03.243
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

04:03.284 --> 04:06.621
<i>I wasn't sure what you
remembered. Like, if anything.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:10.166
<i>I don't, much.
Except for the swears.</i>

04:10.208 --> 04:13.294
<i>But, yeah, she was fun.</i>

04:13.336 --> 04:16.589
<i>Yes. She was.</i>

04:21.261 --> 04:23.221
<i>You want some of this?</i>

04:23.263 --> 04:25.682
<i>I'd rather put out
a campfire with my face.</i>

04:27.934 --> 04:30.061
<i>That was always one of
my favorites.</i>

04:30.103 --> 04:32.021
<i>You miss her?</i>

04:32.063 --> 04:35.191
<i>Oh, she's in my thoughts
all the time.</i>

04:39.988 --> 04:41.322
<i>Got to go.</i>

04:45.159 --> 04:48.955
<i>-Later, Dad.
- See you.</i>

05:06.514 --> 05:08.725
<i>Hey.</i>

05:08.766 --> 05:11.644
<i>Ah. Matt always did
keep us on our toes.</i>

05:11.686 --> 05:14.147
<i>Yeah, he really outdid
himself this time, huh?</i>

05:14.188 --> 05:15.982
<i>-Hey, Mr. Caldwell.
- Hey.</i>

05:16.024 --> 05:17.692
<i>Oh. What a relief.</i>

05:17.734 --> 05:19.193
<i>-Mm.
- You can say that again.</i>

05:19.235 --> 05:20.570
<i>You know, I knew Matty
would be all right,</i>

05:20.611 --> 05:21.738
<i>he always is,
but I got to tell you,</i>

05:21.779 --> 05:22.780
<i>he had me worried this time.</i>

05:22.822 --> 05:24.699
<i>Yeah. Me, too. Me, too.</i>

05:26.200 --> 05:28.828
<i>Oh, hey. Okay.</i>

05:28.870 --> 05:30.997
<i>And what time was this?</i>

05:31.039 --> 05:32.415
<i>Around ten.</i>

05:32.457 --> 05:33.750
<i>And you said it was FaceTime,</i>

05:33.791 --> 05:35.001
<i>so did you see where he was?</i>

05:35.043 --> 05:38.004
<i>Looked like a hotel room.</i>

05:38.046 --> 05:39.589
<i>He said he was in New York City.</i>

05:42.216 --> 05:44.093
<i>Did he look injured at all?</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:45.636
<i>Injured?</i>

05:45.678 --> 05:47.347
<i>We found his blood in the woods.</i>

05:47.388 --> 05:49.349
<i>Right. Right. Um...</i>

05:49.390 --> 05:51.934
<i>I didn't see any injury. No.</i>

05:51.976 --> 05:54.187
<i>Did he tell you what happened,</i>

05:54.228 --> 05:57.065
<i>or who the other person was
out there? Anything?</i>

05:57.106 --> 05:59.484
<i>You know, I-I didn't
think to ask.</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:01.361
<i>I mean, I was just very relieved</i>

06:01.402 --> 06:03.237
<i>that my son was alive,
you know?</i>

06:04.614 --> 06:06.616
<i>What he put you through,</i>

06:06.657 --> 06:08.451
<i>what... the whole... what
he put the whole town through,</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:09.744
<i>it's definitely not okay.</i>

06:09.786 --> 06:12.997
<i>No, it's not.
He owes me a call.</i>

06:13.039 --> 06:14.457
<i>Sure.</i>

06:14.499 --> 06:16.084
<i>I've tried his cell
a number of times.</i>

06:16.125 --> 06:17.668
<i>It just goes
straight to voice mail.</i>

06:17.710 --> 06:20.338
<i>So if-if you could help me
get ahold of him...</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:23.257
<i>Look, Chief, if this is about
him killing that white deer</i>

06:23.299 --> 06:25.343
<i>on tribal land,
I will pay the fine.</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:26.803
<i>You know I'm always good for it.</i>

06:26.844 --> 06:28.096
<i>I'm always cleaning up
his messes.</i>

06:28.137 --> 06:29.639
<i>It's not my jurisdiction.</i>

06:29.680 --> 06:32.141
<i>I just need help closing
the missing person's case</i>

06:32.183 --> 06:35.520
<i>and clearing up who assaulted
whom in the woods.</i>

06:35.561 --> 06:38.731
<i>Okay, look, I didn't want
to have to get into this,</i>

06:38.773 --> 06:41.567
<i>but, uh, when I saw him
on FaceTime,</i>

06:41.609 --> 06:43.486
<i>he looked like he was
high on something,</i>

06:43.528 --> 06:45.071
<i>like he hadn't slept in days.</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:47.198
<i>And he does this sometimes.
He goes on benders.</i>

06:47.240 --> 06:50.993
<i>And I won't hear from him
for weeks, or even months.</i>

06:51.035 --> 06:52.745
<i>Well, you heard from him
last night.</i>

06:52.787 --> 06:55.081
<i>Yeah, 'cause he wanted money,
which I wouldn't give him.</i>

06:55.123 --> 06:57.583
<i>I'll try, but-but I'm not
gonna promise anything.</i>

06:57.625 --> 07:00.420
<i>He didn't answer the ten
phone calls I made before that,</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:02.296
<i>or the two after.</i>

07:02.338 --> 07:04.590
<i>Man, he acts like a teenager,</i>

07:04.632 --> 07:06.300
<i>but he's a,
he's a 30-year-old man,</i>

07:06.342 --> 07:09.220
<i>and at some point you got
to let 'em go, right?</i>

07:12.014 --> 07:13.391
<i>No, no.</i>

07:13.433 --> 07:15.017
She's just
out of this meeting now.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.352
Right. We can talk
about it. Yeah, yeah.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.353
<i>But we should probably
schedule it</i>

07:17.395 --> 07:18.813
<i>-at another...
- Hi.</i>

07:18.855 --> 07:20.606
<i>Oh, oh, look, I-I'm sorry,
I told her it was</i>

07:20.648 --> 07:21.732
<i>inappropriate for her
to visit me here, so...</i>

07:21.774 --> 07:23.276
<i>Visit you?</i>

07:24.318 --> 07:26.571
<i>Well, you know, we-we...
we've met once before.</i>

07:26.612 --> 07:28.865
<i>We-we had a couple of drinks,
and we slept together,</i>

07:28.906 --> 07:31.742
<i>and he was amazing.
Wow, that's some, like, real</i>

07:31.784 --> 07:33.327
<i>-Carrie from</i> <i>Homeland</i> <i>shit.
- Uh...</i>

07:33.369 --> 07:34.704
<i>Does it have anything
to do with the case?</i>

07:34.745 --> 07:35.955
<i>I know you're a reporter.</i>

07:35.997 --> 07:37.123
<i>I'm not a reporter.</i>

07:37.165 --> 07:39.041
<i>I'm a podcaster.
Print is dead.</i>

07:39.083 --> 07:40.626
<i>I have a real aversion to liars.</i>

07:40.668 --> 07:42.378
<i>Oh, no, I wasn't lying.</i>

07:42.420 --> 07:44.422
<i>I said I was here to help with
the search, and I was.</i>

07:44.464 --> 07:45.798
<i>And you're doing a story
about it.</i>

07:45.840 --> 07:48.301
<i>A rich, white,
entitled cisgender guy</i>

07:48.342 --> 07:50.470
<i>illegally shoots
a rare white buck</i>

07:50.511 --> 07:52.555
<i>on reservation land,
and then up and disappears?</i>

07:52.597 --> 07:55.725
<i>Of course I am. Was that his dad
you were talking to?</i>

07:55.766 --> 07:57.768
<i>-Well, the story's over, so...
- Have you talked to Matt?</i>

07:57.810 --> 07:59.645
<i>It's weird, right?</i>

07:59.687 --> 08:01.439
<i>I mean, the guy evades
law enforcement</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:03.065
<i>and a town full of
concerned citizens.</i>

08:03.107 --> 08:04.567
<i>Finally pops his head up,</i>

08:04.609 --> 08:06.569
<i>and he can't even bother
to answer his cell phone?</i>

08:06.611 --> 08:08.905
<i>-I've been trying him also.
- Okay. You need to leave now.</i>

08:08.946 --> 08:10.448
<i>Do you think that he
attacked someone in the woods?</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:11.866
<i>Or do you think his dad
is covering for him,</i>

08:11.908 --> 08:13.493
<i>for some odd, strange...</i>

08:13.534 --> 08:16.078
<i>If you don't leave,
I'm going to arrest you</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:17.830
<i>for interfering
with an investigation.</i>

08:20.541 --> 08:23.419
<i>Right. We don't want that.</i>

08:23.461 --> 08:25.796
<i>Call me when you're off. Mm.</i>

08:25.838 --> 08:27.673
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

08:31.177 --> 08:33.429
<i>Okay. I-I...
I just thought that...</i>

08:33.471 --> 08:34.889
<i>Run Matt's credit cards.</i>

08:34.931 --> 08:37.016
<i>I did that a few days ago.
There's no hits.</i>

08:37.058 --> 08:38.559
<i>But you don't buy
what Molly said about...</i>

08:38.601 --> 08:40.561
<i>I don't give a shit
what Molly said.</i>

08:40.603 --> 08:42.688
<i>But I do care
about what Kurt said.</i>

08:42.730 --> 08:45.107
<i>Matt is staying at a hotel
in New York.</i>

08:45.149 --> 08:47.193
<i>Run his cards.</i>

<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>Poor bastard.</i>

09:06.045 --> 09:07.797
<i>I get that he's upset,</i>

09:07.838 --> 09:10.883
<i>but why did he lie
about his son being alive?</i>

<i>and truly terrifying
Trinity Killer.</i>

10:15.239 --> 10:18.284
<i>Spoiler alert,
he didn't kill in threes.</i>

10:18.326 --> 10:21.037
<i>He killed in fucking fours.</i>

10:21.078 --> 10:25.750
<i>Let's talk about kill cycle
Lady in the Water.</i>

10:25.791 --> 10:29.795

<i>For this one, he goes rogue.</i>

<i>Still a woman,

<i>She has a young baby,</i>

11:01.035 --> 11:04.747
<i>who is in the fucking room
when she dies,</i>

11:04.789 --> 11:07.500
<i>crawling in a pool
of his mother's blood.</i>

11:07.541 --> 11:10.753
<i>How fucked-up is that kid now?
Am I right?</i>

11:21.055 --> 11:23.265
<i>-He's usually very friendly.</i>

11:23.307 --> 11:25.017
<i>Maybe he can smell my goats.</i>

11:25.059 --> 11:27.311
<i>I think he's just aggressive
because he hates his name.</i>

11:27.353 --> 11:29.146
<i>I don't know.
I'm new at this.</i>

11:29.188 --> 11:32.525
<i>Maybe I got to go empty the dog.</i>
Okay. I'll be back.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.652
<i>Come on, Garfield.</i>

11:52.211 --> 11:53.254
<i>Jim, did you get the alert?</i>

11:53.295 --> 11:54.922
<i>Yeah, what's going on?</i>

11:54.964 --> 11:56.590
<i>I'm getting to the scene now.</i>

11:56.632 --> 11:58.718
<i>All I know is,
there are multiple injuries,</i>

11:58.759 --> 12:01.053
<i>and Harrison is involved.</i>

12:21.240 --> 12:23.284
<i>Stay back, please.</i>

12:29.457 --> 12:32.251
<i>-Jim. Jim!
- Where's my son?</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:34.420
<i>They're working on him
inside. This way.</i>

12:39.467 --> 12:41.260
<i>Harrison, are you okay?</i>

12:41.302 --> 12:43.262
<i>Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.</i>

12:43.304 --> 12:45.431
Fortunately the stab
wound isn't very deep.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.224
<i>Who stabbed you?</i>

12:47.266 --> 12:49.977
<i>It's-it's... it's not,
it's not that bad.</i>

12:51.479 --> 12:53.731
Harrison, when Tess
found you and Ethan,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.983
<i>she said that you told her
something about</i>

12:56.025 --> 12:57.610
<i>a planned school shooting.</i>

12:57.651 --> 13:01.614
<i>Uh, yeah, that's-that's how
this all started.</i>

13:01.655 --> 13:04.658
<i>Uh, Ethan asked me
to meet him backstage.</i>

13:04.700 --> 13:08.037
<i>And-and then, um,
when we were alone, he,</i>

13:08.078 --> 13:10.372
<i>he told me he wanted to get
revenge on all these kids</i>

13:10.414 --> 13:12.958
<i>that have been bullying him.</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:16.712
<i>He was just gonna
bring guns to school</i>

13:16.754 --> 13:19.215
<i>-and open fire.
- Why did he tell you that?</i>

13:19.256 --> 13:22.760
<i>He, um...</i>

13:22.802 --> 13:24.637
<i>Because he wanted me
to do it with him.</i>

13:24.678 --> 13:26.806
<i>And what happened next?</i>

13:26.847 --> 13:29.391
<i>I told him,
I mean, I-I get it.</i>

13:29.433 --> 13:33.229
<i>I mean, feeling angry
and-and feeling bullied.</i>

13:33.270 --> 13:34.939
<i>But I said, "There's
got to be some other way</i>

13:34.980 --> 13:36.899
<i>we can handle it." I tried
to get him to come with me</i>

13:36.941 --> 13:41.278
<i>to talk to a teacher,
or get him some help, you know?</i>

13:41.320 --> 13:46.325
<i>But, um, that's when he pulled
a knife out of his backpack.</i>

13:46.367 --> 13:51.539
<i>He just came right at me
and stabbed me.</i>

13:55.668 --> 13:58.504
Logan,
check the backpack.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.422
<i>On it.</i>

14:02.466 --> 14:05.219
<i>And then what happened?</i>

14:05.261 --> 14:07.221
<i>Well, it, it all
happened so fast.</i>

14:07.263 --> 14:09.640
<i>I mean, I-I just,
I was really scared,</i>

14:09.682 --> 14:11.517
<i>and I just, like, tackled him</i>

14:11.559 --> 14:13.602
<i>and the knife came out
of his hands, and-and</i>

14:13.644 --> 14:15.312
<i>I-I got to it first,
then I-I was,</i>

14:15.354 --> 14:17.731
<i>I was waving it in front of me,
telling him to stop,</i>

14:17.773 --> 14:20.943
<i>but he just kept charging at me,
like he was crazy, you know?</i>

14:20.985 --> 14:23.195
<i>And...
<i>And that's, um,</i></i>

14:23.237 --> 14:24.697
<i>that's when I got his leg.</i>

14:24.738 --> 14:26.866
<i>I-I think I... I think I cut him
really bad.</i>

14:26.907 --> 14:29.201
<i>He was... he was bleeding so
much, I could... I could see it</i>

14:29.243 --> 14:32.705
<i>soaking through his jeans,
and, um...</i>

14:32.746 --> 14:34.707
<i>then he passed out.</i>

14:36.750 --> 14:38.669
<i>Is-is he... is he gonna die?</i>

14:38.711 --> 14:42.464
<i>I... I-I didn't mean to hurt him
like that, I swear.</i>

14:44.049 --> 14:46.635
<i>I-I didn't mean
to hurt him like that, Dad.</i>

14:47.678 --> 14:49.638
<i>Angela?</i>

14:50.764 --> 14:53.058
<i>I think you need
to take a look at this.</i>

14:53.100 --> 14:55.060
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

14:57.646 --> 15:00.149
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

15:03.444 --> 15:05.529
<i>It's a kill list.</i>

15:09.617 --> 15:11.702
<i>Um...</i>

15:12.286 --> 15:15.748
<i>Did Ethan talk to anyone else
about this?</i>

15:15.789 --> 15:19.376
<i>Is there anyone else who could
have been in on it with him?</i>

15:20.377 --> 15:22.338
<i>No.</i>

15:22.379 --> 15:25.090
<i>I'm his only friend.</i>

15:25.132 --> 15:26.926
<i>Okay.</i>

15:29.970 --> 15:31.931
<i>Logan, you and I are going
to Ethan's house immediately.</i>

15:31.972 --> 15:33.390
<i>We need to check on his parents.</i>

15:33.432 --> 15:35.517
<i>There may be weapons
or explosives there.</i>

15:45.986 --> 15:48.822
<i>Come in.</i>

15:51.659 --> 15:54.161
<i>-Did you take your antibiotic?
- Yeah.</i>

15:55.996 --> 15:58.040
<i>How's it feeling?</i>

16:03.879 --> 16:05.881
<i>I'm pretty freaked out.</i>

16:05.923 --> 16:08.133
<i>Oh.</i>

16:09.093 --> 16:11.136
<i>I just keep...
I keep replaying it.</i>

16:12.554 --> 16:14.515
<i>Ethan coming at me
with that knife.</i>

16:18.560 --> 16:22.022
<i>You ever have a situation scare
the shit out of you like that?</i>

16:25.025 --> 16:25.943
<i></i>

16:30.114 --> 16:32.282
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:32.324 --> 16:33.909
<i>What do you do to deal?</i>

16:33.951 --> 16:35.327
<i>I wrap bad guys</i>

16:35.369 --> 16:37.287
<i>in plastic and kill them.</i>

16:37.329 --> 16:39.832
<i>I, um, guess I...</i>

16:43.377 --> 16:45.671
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

16:49.550 --> 16:51.677
<i>Right. No, for sure.</i>

16:51.719 --> 16:56.181
<i>I mean, you can still talk about
it more with me if you want.</i>

16:56.223 --> 16:58.350
<i>No, I'm okay.</i>

16:58.392 --> 17:01.437
<i>Really. I'm fine.</i>

17:01.478 --> 17:03.689
<i>-Okay.
- I'm fine.</i>

17:06.358 --> 17:08.861
<i>-Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.</i>

17:13.615 --> 17:15.576
<i>slow, eerie music</i>

17:18.954 --> 17:20.914
<i>Aw.</i>

17:20.956 --> 17:24.126
<i>Who's the world's greatest dad?</i>

17:24.168 --> 17:26.795
<i>That's funny.
That's good, Deb.</i>

17:26.837 --> 17:29.631
<i>Man, to think,
from the moment he was born,</i>

17:29.673 --> 17:32.968
<i>you were worried that he would
inherit your fucked-up genes.</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:35.262
<i>But...</i>

17:35.304 --> 17:39.433
<i>he's emotional,
he's empathetic, personable,</i>

17:39.475 --> 17:43.729
<i>popular, heroic even.</i>

17:43.771 --> 17:45.230
<i>And you're so different.</i>

17:45.272 --> 17:46.899
<i>It's gonna be impossible</i>

17:46.940 --> 17:49.777
<i>for you to have a relationship
with your own son.</i>

18:16.386 --> 18:20.349
<i>I can stay home
with you today, if you want.</i>

18:20.390 --> 18:23.435
<i>I know school's shut down.</i>

18:25.020 --> 18:26.688
<i>No, it's cool. Ow.</i>

18:26.730 --> 18:29.108
<i>I can just...
I can hang here by myself.</i>

18:33.904 --> 18:36.115
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

18:37.449 --> 18:39.910
<i>When Ethan came at you,
you were...</i>

18:39.952 --> 18:42.788
<i>facing him, right?</i>

18:42.830 --> 18:44.498
<i>He suddenly charged at you?</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:46.416
<i>-What are you--?
- That's what you told Angela.</i>

18:46.458 --> 18:48.001
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:48.043 --> 18:49.753
<i>Did he knock you down first?</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:51.630
<i>-I-I don't remember.
- Do you remember</i>

18:51.672 --> 18:53.465
<i>if he was holding the knife
in his left or right hand?</i>

18:53.507 --> 18:56.093
<i>No, I-I don't remember which
fucking hand. I was attacked.</i>

18:56.135 --> 18:57.469
<i>It's not every day that type</i>

18:57.511 --> 18:58.971
<i>-of shit happens to me.
- I know. I--</i>

18:59.012 --> 19:00.305
<i>Well, then
why are you interrogating me?</i>

19:00.347 --> 19:02.266
<i>Sorry.</i>

19:02.307 --> 19:04.268
<i>It's just my old forensic brain.</i>

19:04.309 --> 19:06.520
<i>I know
you've been through a lot.</i>

19:06.562 --> 19:09.439
<i>Just stabbed
by my friend, is all.</i>

19:13.986 --> 19:16.029
<i>Where are you going?</i>

19:16.071 --> 19:20.325
<i>Outside to breathe some fresh,
cold air.</i>

19:20.367 --> 19:24.496
<i>Is that all right, or do you
have questions about that, too?</i>

19:32.713 --> 19:35.257
<i>What are you doing?</i>

19:35.299 --> 19:37.759
<i>The stab wound doesn't match
the story he told Angela.</i>

19:37.801 --> 19:40.053
<i>Something's off.</i>

19:40.095 --> 19:42.222
<i>You're off.</i>

19:42.264 --> 19:44.474
<i>He's normal.</i>

19:44.516 --> 19:46.685
<i>Details get mixed up.</i>

19:47.269 --> 19:50.814
<i>Normal people, you know,
fuckers who aren't mental cases,</i>

19:50.856 --> 19:54.693
<i>they get rattled
when crazy shit happens.</i>

19:55.903 --> 19:57.905
<i>I hope you're right.</i>

19:58.906 --> 20:01.033
<i>Do you?</i>

20:01.074 --> 20:03.327
Nah, he wasn't there
when we arrived on scene.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.204
Yeah, I don't know
what happened there, but, uh--

20:05.245 --> 20:06.955
<i>Nah, I don't know.</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:09.666
<i>Yeah, you know, they said
that we need to go back, so...</i>

20:15.923 --> 20:18.383
<i>Excuse me?</i>

20:23.680 --> 20:27.226
<i>Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Williams.
Um...</i>

20:28.227 --> 20:31.730
<i>I-I just came
to see how Ethan was doing.</i>

20:32.731 --> 20:35.192
<i>He's still very sedated.</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:37.236
<i>He lost so much blood,
he could have died</i>

20:37.277 --> 20:40.030
<i>if the paramedics hadn't gotten
there as quickly as they did.</i>

20:41.990 --> 20:43.951
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

20:43.992 --> 20:47.162
<i>I... I-I didn't mean to, um...</i>

20:49.414 --> 20:52.376
<i>E-Ethan's, like,
my only friend here.</i>

20:53.335 --> 20:55.754
<i>He liked you, too.</i>

20:55.796 --> 20:57.798
<i>How-how are you doing?</i>

20:57.839 --> 21:00.467
<i>Oh, I'm... I'm okay.</i>

21:00.509 --> 21:04.263
<i>Um... maybe, uh,
maybe when Ethan's better</i>

21:04.304 --> 21:07.266
<i>-and comes home--
- He isn't coming home.</i>

21:07.307 --> 21:09.017
<i>Well, I thought
that the-the surgery--</i>

21:09.059 --> 21:11.186
<i>What do you think
is going on here?</i>

21:11.228 --> 21:13.272
<i>Iron Lake isn't
our home anymore.</i>

21:13.313 --> 21:15.107
<i>We've been getting
death threats.</i>

21:15.148 --> 21:18.110
<i>No one's ever gonna buy anything
from my store again.</i>

21:18.151 --> 21:20.237
<i>We have to sell our house
and leave.</i>

21:20.279 --> 21:23.573
<i>And Ethan's probably going
to juvie.</i>

21:23.615 --> 21:26.618
<i>-Why didn't you come to us?
- Beth, it's not his fault.</i>

21:26.660 --> 21:29.705
<i>If you had just told me,
I could have helped.</i>

21:29.746 --> 21:33.375
<i>God, it didn't need
to happen this way.</i>

21:33.417 --> 21:35.794
<i>You should have come to us!</i>

21:46.221 --> 21:48.181
<i>Listen,</i>

21:48.223 --> 21:50.183
<i>she's obviously very upset.</i>

21:50.225 --> 21:52.394
<i>We both are.</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:57.232
<i>You should know
we appreciate what you did.</i>

21:58.525 --> 22:00.569
<i>It could've been a lot worse.</i>

22:02.237 --> 22:06.116
<i>But we don't ever want
to see you again.</i>

22:06.158 --> 22:08.410
<i>You understand?</i>

22:08.452 --> 22:10.454
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

22:17.836 --> 22:19.796
<i>Hey, Jim.</i>

22:19.838 --> 22:21.173
<i>How's Harrison?</i>

22:21.214 --> 22:24.259
<i>Uh, he's okay,
all things considered.</i>

22:24.301 --> 22:26.345
<i>I heard the stab wound
wasn't too deep.</i>

22:26.386 --> 22:28.430
<i>Yeah, you know
about as much as I do, then.</i>

22:32.809 --> 22:35.354
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>Going
to the police station to see</i>

22:35.395 --> 22:37.939
<i>if your son is lying
about a stabbing he was in.</i>

22:37.981 --> 22:40.359
<i>What page of
the parenting handbook is that?</i>

22:52.245 --> 22:54.206
Are you sure
you want to look at that?

22:54.247 --> 22:56.875
<i>I'm curious.</i>

23:01.296 --> 23:03.673
<i>Jim, I'm a cop,</i>

23:03.715 --> 23:05.801
<i>and I'm messed up knowing
that Audrey was meant</i>

23:05.842 --> 23:08.011
<i>to be a victim of Ethan's.</i>

23:08.053 --> 23:10.680
<i>But your son actually
was attacked.</i>

23:10.722 --> 23:12.849
<i>I was meant to be a victim?</i>

23:12.891 --> 23:14.559
<i>Audz, I told you,
you cannot be in here.</i>

23:14.601 --> 23:16.561
<i>-Don't change the subject.
- Audrey.</i>

23:16.603 --> 23:18.688
<i>I deserve to know if I was.</i>

23:20.774 --> 23:24.069
<i>-Holy shit.
- Audz, out. Out.</i>

23:24.111 --> 23:25.737
<i>-Now!
- What about Jim?</i>

23:25.779 --> 23:28.657
<i>-Why is he in here?
- He should go, too.</i>

23:28.698 --> 23:31.868
<i>I actually have some information
that might be helpful.</i>

23:31.910 --> 23:33.870
<i>You do?</i>

23:33.912 --> 23:36.039
<i>Yeah, the weapons you found
stashed in Ethan's room,</i>

23:36.081 --> 23:37.874
<i>they're from Fred's.</i>

23:37.916 --> 23:40.919
<i>I sold them to Ethan's father
a couple of months ago.</i>

23:44.256 --> 23:46.800
<i>Along with that knife.</i>

24:03.358 --> 24:05.444
<i>What is your problem?</i>

24:06.027 --> 24:09.739
<i>The angle of the penetration
of his wound,</i>

24:09.781 --> 24:11.825
<i>the blood spatter.</i>

24:13.076 --> 24:15.036
<i>Nothing matches his story.</i>

24:15.078 --> 24:16.872
<i>His story?</i>

24:16.913 --> 24:19.624
<i>He was stabbed,
non-fictitiously.</i>

24:19.666 --> 24:21.334
<i>It doesn't add up.</i>

24:21.376 --> 24:22.878
<i>Everything he said about Ethan
turned out to be true.</i>

24:22.919 --> 24:25.922
<i>The kill list, the weapons.
It all adds up.</i>

24:35.765 --> 24:37.851
<i>Prove it.</i>

24:38.852 --> 24:40.604
<i>What?</i>

24:40.645 --> 24:43.482
<i>You're Ethan. I'm Harrison.
Show me what happened.</i>

24:46.151 --> 24:48.820
<i>-Do it.
- You are fucking crazy.</i>

24:48.862 --> 24:50.739
<i>-Harrison's lying.
- You can't handle the fact</i>

24:50.780 --> 24:52.449
<i>that Harrison is a hero.</i>

24:52.491 --> 24:55.076
<i>That was always your wet dream.</i>

24:55.118 --> 24:57.829
<i>-Yay!</i>

24:58.914 --> 25:01.541
<i>And you can't stand the fact
that he's living it,</i>

25:01.583 --> 25:03.335
<i>because you are a jealous,</i>

25:03.376 --> 25:05.462
<i>-fucking pussy.</i>

25:08.006 --> 25:09.925
<i>Blood doesn't lie.</i>

25:09.966 --> 25:11.676
<i>The spatter doesn't match.</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:16.640
<i>How do we recreate
these patterns?</i>

25:19.309 --> 25:21.353
<i>I don't know.</i>

25:23.438 --> 25:26.358
<i>This time we see if Harrison
attacked Ethan first.</i>

25:26.399 --> 25:28.109
<i>slow, melancholy music</i>

25:28.151 --> 25:31.530
<i>What are you trying to do here?</i>

25:31.571 --> 25:33.532
<i>-Make sense of this.
- No, you're not.</i>

25:33.573 --> 25:37.452
<i>You're trying to make him
into a monster, like you.</i>

25:38.912 --> 25:42.541
<i>'Cause that's the only way you
can feel like a real dad, right?</i>

25:42.582 --> 25:45.001
<i>Is if he looks up to you
and wants to be like you</i>

25:45.043 --> 25:47.879
<i>so you could have some sick-ass
serial killer family.</i>

25:48.838 --> 25:51.925
<i>He's a good kid.
He's nothing like you.</i>

25:53.009 --> 25:55.720
<i>I am so sick of your bullshit.</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:05.689
<i>It matches.</i>

26:05.730 --> 26:07.774
<i>Stop it!</i>

26:07.816 --> 26:11.236
<i>This is all in your head!
You are creating this!</i>

26:22.122 --> 26:24.624
<i>Ethan was the one trying
to get away.</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:26.543
<i>No.</i>

26:28.503 --> 26:31.798
<i>Harrison attacked him
from behind.</i>

26:31.840 --> 26:35.927
<i>Then he stabbed himself
to sell us on this story.</i>

26:37.596 --> 26:39.598
<i>He planned the whole thing.</i>

26:39.639 --> 26:42.517
<i>Tell me
that's not what happened.</i>

26:42.559 --> 26:45.103
<i>Why would Harrison slash
Ethan first?</i>

26:45.145 --> 26:47.272
<i>He didn't hate him.</i>

26:55.322 --> 26:57.782
<i>He wanted to know
what it felt like.</i>

27:04.289 --> 27:07.208
<i>It's almost like
he fit the Code.</i>

27:22.015 --> 27:24.100
<i>Smells good.</i>

27:41.284 --> 27:43.828
<i>He even eats like me.</i>

27:48.541 --> 27:50.502
<i>What?</i>

27:50.543 --> 27:52.170
<i>How you feeling?</i>

27:52.212 --> 27:54.255
<i>Lot less pain, actually.</i>

27:54.297 --> 27:56.257
<i>I know school's back on,
but they'd understand</i>

27:56.299 --> 27:58.343
<i>if you stayed home another day.</i>

27:59.302 --> 28:01.346
<i>I want to get back
into a routine.</i>

28:03.348 --> 28:04.974
<i>I totally get that.</i>

28:06.434 --> 28:09.729
<i>So did you notice anything
going on with Ethan</i>

28:09.771 --> 28:11.981
<i>before that day?</i>

28:14.984 --> 28:18.363
<i>I didn't know anything until
Ethan got me alone at school.</i>

28:29.958 --> 28:32.502
<i>-Kurt, what's going on?
- Hey, Jim.</i>

28:32.544 --> 28:35.839
<i>Well, I just thought
I'd bring Iron Lake's own hero</i>

28:35.880 --> 28:37.841
<i>-a little show of appreciation.</i>

28:37.882 --> 28:39.509
<i>-Oh.
- How's he doing?</i>

28:39.551 --> 28:43.346
<i>He's a little rattled,
as you can imagine,</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:44.973
<i>but I can take it in to him.</i>

28:45.014 --> 28:47.058
<i>Was kind of hoping
to shake his hand,</i>

28:47.100 --> 28:49.561
<i>thank him personally, you know?</i>

28:50.478 --> 28:52.313
<i>-Okay.
- Yeah?</i>

28:52.355 --> 28:54.649
<i>Sure.</i>

28:54.691 --> 28:56.735
<i>Hey!</i>

28:56.776 --> 28:59.863
<i>There he is. Hey, stud.</i>

28:59.904 --> 29:02.741
<i>I, uh,
got you a little something</i>

29:02.782 --> 29:05.034
<i>-for keeping our town safe.</i>

29:05.076 --> 29:07.203
<i>Thanks.</i>

29:07.245 --> 29:08.872
<i>-Just, yeah, go ahead, open it.
- Oh.</i>

29:08.913 --> 29:10.874
<i>It's for you.</i>

29:12.834 --> 29:14.419
<i>-Oh.
- Huh?</i>

29:14.461 --> 29:16.921
<i>Holy shit. A...</i>

29:16.963 --> 29:18.298
<i>A drone.</i>

29:18.339 --> 29:20.800
<i>This is really cool.</i>

29:20.842 --> 29:22.051
<i>Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.</i>

29:22.093 --> 29:23.970
<i>Oh, just call me Kurt.</i>

29:24.012 --> 29:26.014
<i>Okay.</i>

29:26.055 --> 29:28.475
<i>Well, I, um,
I should... I should go.</i>

29:28.516 --> 29:30.477
<i>Thanks again, Kurt.</i>

29:30.518 --> 29:32.937
<i>Yeah. No, well, thank you.
Thank you, son.</i>

29:49.204 --> 29:51.414
<i>Ah, boy, must be nice.</i>

29:51.456 --> 29:52.957
<i>Hmm?</i>

29:52.999 --> 29:55.043
<i>Having a hero for a son.</i>

29:55.084 --> 29:56.669
<i>Ah.</i>

29:56.711 --> 30:00.256
<i>Yeah, my Matt,
he's... he's the opposite.</i>

30:00.298 --> 30:02.258
<i>Well, he seems like a fun person
to be around.</i>

30:02.300 --> 30:05.386
<i>Ah, no, he's a fuckup.</i>

30:05.428 --> 30:06.721
<i>Wish I'd done something about it</i>

30:06.763 --> 30:08.056
<i>when he first started
fucking up.</i>

30:08.097 --> 30:09.641
<i>Kept thinking
he'd grow out of it.</i>

30:09.682 --> 30:11.476
<i>But there was a darkness in him,</i>

30:11.518 --> 30:13.436
<i>-and you knew it.
- Yeah, but I just kept</i>

30:13.478 --> 30:16.064
<i>helping him get out of trouble.</i>

30:18.650 --> 30:22.779
<i>But it's not really
Matt's fault, you know?</i>

30:22.821 --> 30:24.405
<i>It's my fault.</i>

30:24.447 --> 30:25.949
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

30:25.990 --> 30:28.493
<i>Well... the truth is,</i>

30:28.535 --> 30:31.412
<i>I just raised a terrible kid.</i>

30:31.454 --> 30:35.708
<i>I mean, my Matt's much more
like Ethan than he is Harrison.</i>

30:35.750 --> 30:37.460
<i>-No.
- No, he's worse.</i>

30:37.502 --> 30:39.045
<i>I-I mean, Ethan might have
wanted to kill people,</i>

30:39.087 --> 30:40.505
<i>but Matt actually did.</i>

30:40.547 --> 30:42.632
<i>Hey, he didn't mean
to crash that boat.</i>

30:42.674 --> 30:44.300
<i>He didn't crash it.</i>

30:44.342 --> 30:46.678
<i>He wasn't driving.</i>

30:46.719 --> 30:49.722
<i>No, I know. I meant it
the same way you did.</i>

30:49.764 --> 30:51.516
<i>How do you even know
about that?</i>

30:52.892 --> 30:54.853
<i>My girlfriend's
the chief of police.</i>

30:54.894 --> 30:57.856
<i>And not
to throw anyone under the bus,</i>

30:57.897 --> 31:00.483
<i>but Esther's a bit of a gossip.</i>

31:00.525 --> 31:03.278
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

31:03.319 --> 31:05.905
<i>So what did Esther
and your girlfriend say</i>

31:05.947 --> 31:07.699
<i>about the boat accident?</i>

31:07.740 --> 31:09.701
<i>That Matt wasn't driving,</i>

31:09.742 --> 31:12.954
<i>and that teenagers do
stupid things.</i>

31:12.996 --> 31:14.539
<i>He wasn't a teenager.</i>

31:14.581 --> 31:15.957
<i>Oh, I didn't know that.</i>

31:15.999 --> 31:18.209
<i>I knew that.</i>

31:18.251 --> 31:21.212
<i>Look, Kurt, you can't
carry around this guilt.</i>

31:21.254 --> 31:23.548
<i>Kids are born the way they are.</i>

31:24.132 --> 31:27.468
<i>I wasn't in Harrison's life
for the last ten years.</i>

31:27.510 --> 31:29.387
<i>Look how he turned out.</i>

31:33.766 --> 31:35.560
<i>Yeah, you're right.</i>

31:35.602 --> 31:37.228
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

31:39.606 --> 31:41.190
<i>But you'll see.</i>

31:41.232 --> 31:42.901
<i>You know, if Harrison
ever does anything wrong,</i>

31:42.942 --> 31:46.654
<i>it is hard not
to feel responsible for it.</i>

31:53.953 --> 31:55.914
<i>Fuck.</i>

31:55.955 --> 31:58.875
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>The guy's fishing,
and I just nibbled.</i>

32:04.339 --> 32:06.132
<i>-Hey.
-[Angela]</i> <i>So,</i>

32:06.174 --> 32:07.675
<i>I just wanted
to formally let you know</i>

32:07.717 --> 32:09.093
<i>that we're not bringing
any charges</i>

32:09.135 --> 32:11.095
<i>against Harrison
for stabbing Ethan.</i>

32:11.137 --> 32:13.598
<i>It's been ruled
an act of self-defense,</i>

32:13.640 --> 32:16.100
<i>no matter what Ethan tried
to claim.</i>

32:16.142 --> 32:18.102
<i>What did he say?</i>

32:18.144 --> 32:20.939
<i>He swears
he never stabbed Harrison.</i>

32:21.814 --> 32:23.942
<i>Well, how does he explain--?</i>

32:23.983 --> 32:26.945
<i>He said that Harrison
just suddenly slashed him.</i>

32:26.986 --> 32:29.197
<i>And that's the last thing
he remembers.</i>

32:30.990 --> 32:34.535
<i>You know, I try to have
some compassion for him.</i>

32:34.577 --> 32:36.871
<i>He's clearly a troubled kid.</i>

32:36.913 --> 32:39.123
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:39.165 --> 32:43.086
<i>So, we're moving forward
with our case against Ethan.</i>

32:43.127 --> 32:44.545
<i>And I don't know if you want me</i>

32:44.587 --> 32:46.089
<i>to put you in touch
with a lawyer,</i>

32:46.130 --> 32:48.132
<i>if you want to look
into a civil case, or--</i>

32:48.174 --> 32:50.802
<i>No, he and his family
are going through enough.</i>

32:50.843 --> 32:53.513
<i>Wow.
If I were in your position,</i>

32:53.554 --> 32:55.598
<i>I don't know if I could be
so compassionate.</i>

32:55.640 --> 32:59.018
<i>You're a good person, Jim.</i>

32:59.060 --> 33:00.687
<i>-Take it.</i>

33:00.728 --> 33:01.813
<i>I'll call you later?</i>

33:01.854 --> 33:03.940
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

33:03.982 --> 33:06.025
<i>Love you, too.</i>

33:09.237 --> 33:11.656
<i>Chief Bishop.</i>

33:13.199 --> 33:15.284
<i>Ethan's telling the truth.</i>

33:15.910 --> 33:20.248
<i>This wound wasn't made
by a hunting knife.</i>

33:20.289 --> 33:23.418
<i>Harrison brought his own weapon
to school that day.</i>

33:23.459 --> 33:26.170
<i>Hey.
I heard your son was amazing.</i>

33:30.174 --> 33:32.135
<i>Gonna call you back.</i>

33:32.176 --> 33:33.511
<i>Just wait a minute.</i>

33:33.553 --> 33:36.431
<i>I come with a peace offering.</i>

33:41.728 --> 33:43.479
<i>I'm not drinking, Molly.</i>

33:43.521 --> 33:44.772
<i>Well, there's no point
in sticking around.</i>

33:44.814 --> 33:46.107
<i>I've alienated the one person</i>

33:46.149 --> 33:47.650
<i>that I needed
to tell this story.</i>

33:47.692 --> 33:49.694
<i>-Can I get that in writing?</i>

33:55.074 --> 33:58.995
<i>Consider this...
my goodbye present.</i>

34:00.747 --> 34:02.874
<i>Faith Darwas.
Three days ago,</i>

34:02.915 --> 34:06.044
<i>outside of a Dollar Store in Tulsa.</i>

34:06.085 --> 34:10.590
<i>I googled a few of your, uh,
names on this Carrie board here.</i>

34:10.631 --> 34:12.091
<i>Which, by the way, is not a jab.</i>

34:12.133 --> 34:13.801
<i>I mean,
that it's crazy thorough,</i>

34:13.843 --> 34:16.596
<i>which is how
people describe my work.</i>

34:16.637 --> 34:18.765
<i>How did you get this?</i>

34:18.806 --> 34:21.184
<i>I posted their pics on my
Merry Fucking Kill</i> <i>Insta-feed.</i>

34:21.225 --> 34:23.728
<i>You'd be surprised
what 800,000 amateur sleuths</i>

34:23.770 --> 34:26.397
<i>can dig up
in a matter of hours.</i>

34:28.066 --> 34:29.650
<i>I also got
her last three addresses</i>

34:29.692 --> 34:31.069
<i>and a cell phone number.</i>

34:31.110 --> 34:34.197
<i>-You talked to her?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

34:34.238 --> 34:35.698
<i>She goes by Lauren now.</i>

34:35.740 --> 34:37.909
<i>She left because her mom was
a pill-popper</i>

34:37.950 --> 34:40.536
<i>with a rotating door
of shitty boyfriends.</i>

34:40.578 --> 34:42.205
<i>She's doing a lot better now.</i>

34:42.246 --> 34:44.665
<i>So she was just another runaway.</i>

34:44.707 --> 34:46.959
<i>Just like everybody said.</i>

34:48.878 --> 34:51.255
<i>She is alive.
That's a good thing.</i>

34:51.297 --> 34:54.717
<i>Well, yeah, of course.
It's just...</i>

34:54.759 --> 34:57.845
<i>Um...</i>

34:57.887 --> 34:59.931
<i>Maybe I am fucking crazy.</i>

34:59.972 --> 35:02.225
<i>Look, I pretty much
traffic in crazy,</i>

35:02.266 --> 35:04.435
<i>and you are
most definitely not.</i>

35:05.394 --> 35:08.272
<i>I posted these ones, as well.</i>

35:09.232 --> 35:11.984
<i>Nothing. Not one sighting.</i>

35:12.026 --> 35:15.154
<i>Not even a psychic claiming to
feel their aura in New Mexico,</i>

35:15.196 --> 35:17.198
<i>and I usually get
at least three of those.</i>

35:17.240 --> 35:19.700
<i>So whoever these women are,</i>

35:19.742 --> 35:21.452
<i>they are most definitely
missing.</i>

35:21.494 --> 35:24.080
<i>And no one is looking
for them, except for you.</i>

35:25.623 --> 35:27.083
<i>Let me in on your theory.</i>

35:27.125 --> 35:29.168
<i>'Cause I know you got one.</i>

35:37.426 --> 35:39.470
<i>When I was in high school,
my best friend disappeared.</i>

35:41.430 --> 35:42.807
<i>Iris.</i>

35:42.849 --> 35:45.059
<i>Everyone said she ran away.</i>

35:45.101 --> 35:46.727
<i>No one looked for her.</i>

35:46.769 --> 35:48.312
<i>It stuck with you.</i>

35:49.272 --> 35:51.607
<i>So, when I became a cop,
I promised myself</i>

35:51.649 --> 35:54.235
<i>that I'd be different.</i>

35:54.277 --> 35:56.988
<i>I got a reputation as being
the cop who would listen.</i>

35:57.029 --> 35:59.323
<i>I started collecting
these women's stories.</i>

35:59.365 --> 36:01.325
<i>Poor, from troubled homes.</i>

36:01.367 --> 36:02.702
<i>Some of them Native.</i>

36:02.743 --> 36:06.581
<i>Everyone assumes
they just moved on.</i>

36:08.583 --> 36:12.670
<i>But I know in my gut something
terrible is happening to them.</i>

36:15.590 --> 36:18.009
I know
you don't want to hear this,

36:18.050 --> 36:20.136
<i>but I think
we should form an alliance.</i>

36:22.180 --> 36:24.140
<i>I mean,
what if I followed the story</i>

36:24.182 --> 36:27.059
<i>while you investigate,
from a close proximity?</i>

36:27.101 --> 36:29.478
<i>I mean, you said it yourself.
You need resources.</i>

36:29.520 --> 36:31.939
<i>And I've got an army
of armchair detectives.</i>

36:31.981 --> 36:34.984
<i>I-I thought you wanted
to do the Matt Caldwell story.</i>

36:35.026 --> 36:37.612
<i>Well, you know, every great
podcast starts about one thing</i>

36:37.653 --> 36:40.364
<i>and then ends up somewhere
completely unexpected.</i>

36:47.079 --> 36:49.540
<i>If you want to help me
shed light on these women,</i>

36:49.582 --> 36:51.042
<i>I'll take it.</i>

36:51.083 --> 36:53.211
<i>Great.</i>

36:53.252 --> 36:55.171
<i>Okay.</i>

36:55.213 --> 36:58.216
<i>I know
this is gonna take a while,</i>

36:58.257 --> 37:01.219
<i>but I need you to run me
through everything you have.</i>

37:08.392 --> 37:10.686
<i>Okay. Now I'm ready.</i>

37:19.445 --> 37:21.530
<i></i>

37:21.572 --> 37:23.532
<i>Uh, yeah, come in.</i>

37:24.492 --> 37:26.452
<i>Mr. Caldwell,
sorry to bother you,</i>

37:26.494 --> 37:28.371
<i>but a few customers
have mentioned</i>

37:28.412 --> 37:30.706
<i>-the girl camped out in our--
- Uh, I'll take care of it.</i>

37:30.748 --> 37:32.750
<i>-Really? I don't mind.
- I got it.</i>

37:32.792 --> 37:34.877
<i>Thanks, Susan.</i>

37:45.471 --> 37:47.306
<i>Hi, Kurt. Just checking</i>

37:47.348 --> 37:49.225
<i>to see
if you've heard from Matt.</i>

37:49.267 --> 37:52.436
<i>I have a couple of questions
that I need to ask, so--</i>

38:01.946 --> 38:05.408
<i></i>

38:10.871 --> 38:12.456
<i>Okay.</i>

38:17.837 --> 38:20.881
<i>Hey, uh, Chloe, right?</i>

38:20.923 --> 38:23.843
<i>Yeah. Look, I-I know I said
I was gonna use that money</i>

38:23.884 --> 38:25.886
<i>you gave me
to get bus fare to my mom's,</i>

38:25.928 --> 38:28.389
<i>but I, I was really hungry</i>

38:28.431 --> 38:29.807
<i>and-and I needed
to buy a new coat,</i>

38:29.849 --> 38:31.267
<i>'cause it's cold
as hell out there,</i>

38:31.309 --> 38:33.686
<i>-and I just--
- It's okay. It's okay.</i>

38:34.687 --> 38:38.190
<i>If you spot me another 80,</i>

38:38.232 --> 38:39.984
<i>I will get that bus fare.</i>

38:40.026 --> 38:41.902
<i>I swear, just-just give me
your address, and I'll...</i>

38:41.944 --> 38:43.988
<i>and I'll send it back to you
as soon as I get to my mom's.</i>

38:44.030 --> 38:46.991
<i>I can't keep
giving you money, sweetheart.</i>

38:52.204 --> 38:54.582
<i>You know what I can give you?</i>

38:54.623 --> 38:57.460
<i>A job.</i>

38:57.501 --> 38:59.462
<i>Waitress at the diner.</i>

38:59.503 --> 39:01.464
<i>Make your own money.
What do you say?</i>

39:04.425 --> 39:07.762
<i>The thing is, I'm...
I'm not staying.</i>

39:08.721 --> 39:10.848
<i>I just need bus fare.</i>

39:10.890 --> 39:13.142
<i>-Can you just</i>

39:13.184 --> 39:15.353
<i>help me with that?</i>

39:17.813 --> 39:21.484
<i>Coach Logan, or should I say
Sergeant Logan,</i>

39:21.525 --> 39:23.694
<i>who is here with us today
in his official capacity</i>

39:23.736 --> 39:27.656
<i>to talk to you because you were
on Ethan's list. Listen up.</i>

39:33.287 --> 39:34.538
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

39:34.580 --> 39:36.791
<i>-What's up, Coach?</i>

39:36.832 --> 39:39.168
<i>Okay, okay, settle down.</i>

39:39.210 --> 39:43.214
<i>Um... first of all,</i>

39:43.255 --> 39:46.175
<i>I want to say how proud I am of
how you all handled yourselves</i>

39:46.217 --> 39:49.428
<i>during a situation
I obviously wish</i>

39:49.470 --> 39:51.222
<i>you'd never had to experience.</i>

39:59.730 --> 40:03.317
<i>You acted with... maturity</i>

40:03.359 --> 40:05.403
<i>and courage.</i>

40:05.444 --> 40:08.364
<i>Uh, but please be understanding
of yourselves,</i>

40:08.406 --> 40:10.157
<i>or-or any of your friends</i>

40:10.199 --> 40:13.411
<i>who are going through
a tough time in the aftermath.</i>

40:14.870 --> 40:17.581
<i>Counseling is being offered
to each of you.</i>

40:17.623 --> 40:21.252
<i>It's a scary thing</i>

40:21.293 --> 40:23.337
<i>to be targeted like that.</i>

40:23.379 --> 40:25.589
<i>It's good to talk about it,
how you feel.</i>

40:29.802 --> 40:31.387
<i>Uh, I'd like
to open this up to anyone</i>

40:31.429 --> 40:32.680
<i>who'd like
to share their concerns or...</i>

40:32.721 --> 40:34.765
<i>or ask me any questions.</i>

40:36.142 --> 40:37.977
<i>Zach.</i>

40:38.018 --> 40:41.564
<i>Uh, yeah, I just want
to give a shout-out to Harrison</i>

40:41.605 --> 40:43.649
<i>for saving all our asses.</i>

40:49.780 --> 40:53.075
<i>Um, yeah, I-I think
I speak for all of us</i>

40:53.117 --> 40:55.619
<i>when I say how grateful we are</i>

40:55.661 --> 40:57.455
<i>that you're a part
of our community.</i>

40:57.496 --> 40:59.999
Speech!
Speech!

41:00.040 --> 41:01.667
<i>Speech! Speech! Speech!</i>

41:01.709 --> 41:03.419
<i>Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!</i>

41:03.461 --> 41:04.753
All right, but if he
doesn't want to talk, it's okay.

<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

41:08.549 --> 41:10.468
<i>I mean, I don't really
know what to say.</i>

41:10.509 --> 41:13.971
<i>Um, I'm glad no one got hurt.</i>

41:14.013 --> 41:17.308
<i>-Except Ethan.</i>

41:19.268 --> 41:21.896
<i>You-you know, personally,</i>

41:21.937 --> 41:24.648
<i>I don't really hold anything
against Ethan.</i>

41:25.399 --> 41:29.778
<i>I mean, yeah, he, uh, he planned
to do something terrible.</i>

41:29.820 --> 41:32.823
<i>And he ended up stabbing me,</i>

41:32.865 --> 41:35.242
<i>but, uh,</i>

41:35.284 --> 41:37.995
<i>you guys picked on him
for years.</i>

41:40.039 --> 41:42.500
<i>You-you beat him up,
made fun of him.</i>

41:44.043 --> 41:46.378
<i>You kind of made his life hell,
you know?</i>

41:46.420 --> 41:47.838
<i>And I guess it's like, yeah,</i>

41:47.880 --> 41:50.508
<i>yeah, we're all victims,
or whatever.</i>

41:50.549 --> 41:53.802
<i>And I know everyone's saying
that Ethan was a-a-a psycho</i>

41:53.844 --> 41:57.306
<i>or a-a monster or something,</i>

41:57.348 --> 42:00.226
<i>but he was definitely
also a victim.</i>

42:02.269 --> 42:04.188
<i>So...</i>

42:04.230 --> 42:06.315
<i>I don't know.</i>

42:08.776 --> 42:11.028
<i>I guess
we all have two sides to us.</i>

42:11.070 --> 42:15.282
<i>Maybe we're a little bit hero
and a little bit,</i>

42:15.324 --> 42:19.828
<i>I-I don't know, monster.</i>

42:19.870 --> 42:23.082
<i>It's all about
which side wins out in the end.</i>

43:11.130 --> 43:13.048
<i>Trinity used a straight razor</i>

43:13.090 --> 43:17.386
<i>-to kill his mother.</i>
