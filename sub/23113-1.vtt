Ha-ha, didn't hurt!

01:22.160 --> 01:23.435
Ha-ha!
You got nothin' on me, Bones!

Hey! I'm the best!

01:25.040 --> 01:26.554
I'm goin' get ya now!

01:28.680 --> 01:31.115
All right,
let's do this thing.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.594
You can't catch me!

01:36.760 --> 01:38.080
Yeah, run away!

01:40.880 --> 01:41.870
Whoa!

01:42.000 --> 01:44.276
Get outta my way!
Watch it!

01:45.000 --> 01:46.229
Careful.

01:48.000 --> 01:48.990
That was close.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.674
Is that all you got?

01:53.520 --> 01:56.877
Hi, buddy.
I told you I'd be back.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.273
Wow.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.280
- The truck!
- Whoo-hoo!

02:11.480 --> 02:13.392
Out of my way, losers!
Hey!

02:14.160 --> 02:15.514
- Guys, check it out.
- Wow, cool!

02:15.680 --> 02:17.353
Yes! The winner's truck.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.795
It's happening today?

02:18.960 --> 02:20.360
What's happening today?
Ugh.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.591
Don't you know anything,
Ferdinand?

02:22.760 --> 02:23.750
If that truck's here,

02:23.840 --> 02:25.559
it means the matador's
gonna pick a bull.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.154
Who do you think
he's gonna pick?

02:27.320 --> 02:29.391
Duh, my dad.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.439
And when my horns come in,
it'll be my turn.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.550
<i>People will come
from all over Spain</i>

02:37.640 --> 02:41.236
<i>just to see me,
the great Valiente!</i>

02:41.400 --> 02:44.632
<i>The fiercest bull of all time.</i>

02:44.720 --> 02:47.792
<i>I'll take him down big time.</i>

02:47.880 --> 02:50.520
<i>Man versus bull.</i>

02:51.040 --> 02:53.396
<i>Will it be pretty? No.</i>

02:53.560 --> 02:56.359
<i>Will it be awesome? Heck yeah!</i>

02:56.800 --> 03:01.192
<i>The crowd will go nuts,
making me a champ.</i>

03:02.080 --> 03:05.152
I'll spend the rest of my days
living like a king.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.152
Dream on, Valiente.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.312
I'm the one
who's getting selected.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.120
I'm already
working on my victory smile.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.720
Hey, the matador's here!

03:14.920 --> 03:16.991
Where? Where? Oh, no.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.834
I feel sick. Oh, Mama.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.799
There's no matador, Guapo.
What?

03:22.960 --> 03:24.474
What a wimp.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.911
Forget it, Guapo.
He's gonna pick me.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.879
I'm the fastest, baddest
bull around.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.236
I'm so fast,
they won't see me coming.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.760
Bones?
Yeah?

03:33.920 --> 03:35.354
You're never
gonna get selected.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.510
You wanna know why?

03:36.640 --> 03:37.630
Why?

03:41.520 --> 03:44.991
'Cause you're a puny
bag of bones, Bones.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.550
You okay?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.473
I don't need your help,
weirdo.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.596
I'm fine!

03:49.760 --> 03:50.830
Careful.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.952
Oh, what do you got there,
Ferdinand?

03:53.120 --> 03:54.600
Uh, nothing.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.114
"Uh, nothing."

03:56.280 --> 03:59.318
Hey! Don't you guys have
some more headbutting to do?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.631
Nah, this is way more fun.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.274
Can you believe this guy?

04:04.360 --> 04:05.714
The matador is gonna
pick a bull...

04:05.880 --> 04:08.634
and all he's worried about
is a dumb flower.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.640
Cut it out, Valiente!

04:10.800 --> 04:11.790
Make me.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.151
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

04:16.279 --> 04:19.557
I'm not gonna fight you,
Valiente.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.795
Aw, flower bull is scared.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.155
I'm not scared.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.960
Then fight.
That's what bulls do.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.790
You can hit me if you want,
but leave the flower alone.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.639
You're just gonna let him
smack ya?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.031
What? Where's the fun in that?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.279
Whatever.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.192
Have your stupid flower.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.959
The big bulls are going in.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.959
Wish me luck, Ferdinand.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.720
Good luck, Dad.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.599
Go get 'em, Dad!

04:57.760 --> 05:00.036
Come on, guys,
let's see 'em over here.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.280
Out of my way!

05:03.920 --> 05:05.195
Go, bulls!

05:07.880 --> 05:09.599
Whoo-hoo!
Whoa!

05:17.960 --> 05:19.952
It's the matador.
He's gonna pick!

05:20.040 --> 05:23.033
I feel sick.
I think I'm gonna hurl.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.954
You'll get 'em next time, Dad.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.753
Who asked you?

05:50.920 --> 05:52.479
What are you looking at?

05:53.600 --> 05:54.590
Ferdinand!

05:55.400 --> 05:57.392
Ah, there you are!

05:58.120 --> 06:00.510
He picked me.
Can you believe it?

06:00.680 --> 06:04.117
Your dad is gonna fight
for glory in the ring.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.509
You really have to go?

06:05.680 --> 06:08.718
Yeah, of course I have to go.
Come on, Ferd.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.076
This is what every bull
dreams of, right?

06:11.240 --> 06:12.879
I guess.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.436
Is it okay
if it's not my dream?

06:15.880 --> 06:17.394
Well, uh...

06:18.520 --> 06:20.318
Look, Ferd,
you're still a kid, you know.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.194
When you grow up,
your dreams are gonna change.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.880
Everything's gonna change.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.556
I'll tell you one thing
that's gonna change...

06:26.720 --> 06:28.518
you're gonna be bigger
and tougher than your old man,

06:28.600 --> 06:29.590
that's for sure.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.592
No way.
Yes way.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.274
Yeah.
And then you'll see...

06:33.440 --> 06:34.476
you're gonna get in that ring

06:34.560 --> 06:35.914
and you are gonna
be the champ.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.272
Can I be a champ
without fighting maybe?

06:40.840 --> 06:42.433
Oh, Ferdinand.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.834
I really wish the world
worked like that for you,

06:46.920 --> 06:48.195
I do.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.753
But that's just
not how it is for us.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.513
You understand?

06:59.040 --> 07:01.509
Okay, it's time.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.431
You're gonna come back, right?

07:04.600 --> 07:08.150
What? That matador
doesn't stand a chance, okay?

07:08.360 --> 07:09.476
Okay.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.677
And after I win,
I'm coming back here,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.353
and I'm gonna show you
all my moves.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.910
Even my secret ones.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.674
Dad!

08:45.600 --> 08:46.920
Dad.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.800
I called it.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.872
That bull was soft.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.475
And the soft ones
always go down.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.959
You better bull up.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.037
Oh, hey, what are you
doing out here?

09:18.640 --> 09:21.951
Come on. Get back, get back.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.560
Come back to the stall.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.870
Come on, little guy.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.672
A calf is out! Get him!

09:41.080 --> 09:42.719
Get him!

11:35.120 --> 11:36.600
It's okay.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.631
Shh. It's okay.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.393
Hi, there.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.320
Don't be afraid,
little big guy.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.350
Oh.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.152
You like flowers?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.198
I'll take good care of you.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.115
Come on.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.596
This is your home now.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.075
Go on. It's okay.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.350
<i>Always out of place</i>

13:49.440 --> 13:51.875
<i>I knew I needed
something new for me</i>

13:51.960 --> 13:54.634
<i>I never knewjust
what that was</i>

13:54.720 --> 13:56.393
Okay, your turn.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.796
<i>Finding something safe
was just like</i>

13:58.880 --> 14:00.837
<i>Trying to catch
a bird in flight</i>

14:00.920 --> 14:03.833
<i>I knew that I would
never touch</i>

14:04.560 --> 14:08.440
Who's my good boy?
You're my good boy.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.353
Hey, I thought
I was the good boy.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.593
Good night, Ferdinand.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.514
<i>'Cause I'm happy
to call this</i>

14:16.880 --> 14:19.315
<i>Home
No more running</i>

14:20.000 --> 14:21.275
<i>I'm good knowing</i>

14:22.040 --> 14:24.999

14:35.840 --> 14:37.593
<i>Oh, yeah, oh</i>

14:37.680 --> 14:38.830
Ugh!

14:55.480 --> 14:57.073
<i>Being me was hard enough</i>

14:57.160 --> 14:59.720
<i>So being someone else
was too much</i>

14:59.800 --> 15:02.269
<i>All I want is something real</i>

15:03.600 --> 15:07.594
<i>Now I won't let go</i>

15:12.240 --> 15:14.960

Good night, Ferdinand.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.718
<i>'Cause I'm happy

16:24.680 --> 16:27.957
Jorge, rise and shine, buddy.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.120
Come on, Jorge, wake up!
Let's go!

16:32.440 --> 16:34.113
Music to my ears.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.714
Ah, it's gonna be a good one.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.678
Oh, I can feel it
in my horns.

16:37.840 --> 16:38.990
Hey, Paco!

16:39.880 --> 16:40.916
Paco!

16:41.080 --> 16:43.276
Pac-attack. Hey, dawg.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.914
You stoked about the big day?

16:45.080 --> 16:47.914
Stoked?
Have you ever seen me stoked?

16:48.080 --> 16:49.833
Look, I've got some bad news.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.320
Gonna stop you right there.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.312
No bad news allowed

16:53.400 --> 16:56.234
'cause today
is Flower Festival day.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.437
Only the greatest day
of the year.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.080
Okay, that's the thing.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.594
This year...
Hold that thought.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.160
Hey, Maria. You ready to put

17:03.240 --> 17:05.357
those wings to work?

17:05.440 --> 17:07.590
Hey, hey, hey. I just finished
herding those chickens.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.670
Launch.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.715
Maria?

17:11.920 --> 17:13.115
Oh, no. Maria?

17:13.280 --> 17:15.032
Congratulations.
Maria!

17:15.119 --> 17:17.271
You shot Maria into the sun.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.160
Oh, way to go, Maria.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.039
Who says a chicken can't fly?

17:23.200 --> 17:26.079
Uh, the laws of nature say it.
I say it.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.959
Chickens are chickens.
Here we go.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.430
Dogs are dogs, and...
Bulls are bulls.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.512
Yeah. Right. Normal.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.433
Hey, if was a normal bull,

17:34.520 --> 17:36.318
I would have never
found this farm.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.960
And we wouldn't be brothers.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.391
A dog and a bull
can't be brothers.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.516
That would be weird.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.875
Really?

17:42.960 --> 17:44.474
Then why does your tail wag

17:44.560 --> 17:46.950
when I call you brother,
Brother?

17:47.680 --> 17:50.070
- Hey. Stop that.
- Hah!

17:50.160 --> 17:51.992
Looks like weird
is the new normal, buddy.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.753
Come on, before everybody
takes off without us.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.990
Ferdinand, wait!

17:55.160 --> 17:57.356
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.757
There you are.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.195
You ready to go?

18:04.400 --> 18:05.675
I'm sorry, Nina.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.195
Ferdinand can't come
to the festival this year.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.479
But he goes with us
every year.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.838
I know, but he is not
a little calf anymore.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.792
Then I won't go either.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.110
Listen, honey.
It's for his own good.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.193
But, Dad. It's just Ferdinand.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.273
But outside this farm,

18:29.360 --> 18:31.397
they don't know him
like we do.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.951
Sorry, little big guy.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.034
I'll bring you back
the prettiest bouquet in town.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.270
Okay?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.677
Hey, cheer up, buddy!

18:52.840 --> 18:54.991
Flowers are overrated anyway!

18:55.160 --> 18:57.117
Hah, you couldn't pay me
to go to that festival.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.518
Hey. Why don't we bring Paco?
Fun, right?

19:00.680 --> 19:01.875
I guess.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.154
I am not stoked about this.
Not stoked at all.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.520
This doesn't make any sense.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.630
I'm not a little calf anymore,
so what?

19:18.840 --> 19:20.194
More of me to love.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.273
And besides,
bigger bull, bigger helper.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.510
I'm going.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.600
No. No, no. Juan said no.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.672
Juan said no,
I'm not going. It's settled.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.433
But Nina will be miserable
without me.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.749
She needs me.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.638
Ah... But I need to go,
but I need to stay.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.710
And go. Stay. Go.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.360
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.430
What do I do?

19:40.840 --> 19:44.277
If that orange doesn't fall
by the time I count to three,

19:44.360 --> 19:45.350
I'm going.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.790
One...

19:49.240 --> 19:51.436
If that rock is still there

19:51.520 --> 19:52.840
by the time I...

19:52.960 --> 19:56.112
What could you possibly
need that for?

19:56.880 --> 19:57.870
Okay.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.036
If that egg doesn't hatch

19:59.120 --> 20:00.998
by the time I count to ten,
I'm going.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.480
One...

20:02.560 --> 20:03.550
Two, three, four, five, six,

20:03.680 --> 20:04.670
seven, eight, nine, ten.

20:04.760 --> 20:09.391
Whew! Didn't hatch.
Flower Festival, here I come!

20:09.720 --> 20:10.710
Oh!

20:11.840 --> 20:13.513
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20:37.720 --> 20:41.953
Hey! You forgot your bike.
I'll leave it right here.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.630
Wow.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.440
Oh, wow!

21:04.920 --> 21:07.674
This is some next level stuff.

21:17.720 --> 21:18.710
Whoa.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.316
Huh. That was odd.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.232
You don't like the little
piggy balloon?

21:37.120 --> 21:39.271
We'll get you
another balloon, okay?

21:39.400 --> 21:41.357
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

21:41.440 --> 21:42.430
Oh, nice.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.799
Oh!

21:53.880 --> 21:55.439
All yours, little guy.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.551
Ferdinand.
You shouldn't be here.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.950
What?

22:30.800 --> 22:31.790
Nina!

22:32.760 --> 22:34.717
Oh. Now he acts like a bull?

22:38.040 --> 22:39.235
We have a situation here.

22:41.480 --> 22:44.314
It's okay. It's okay.
He won't hurt anyone.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.595
My baby.
The beast got my baby.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.280
A beast? Where?

22:52.360 --> 22:54.033
Ow! Ow!

23:00.800 --> 23:01.790
Huh?

23:05.320 --> 23:06.834
I'm coming, little baby.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.720
Out of the way!

23:14.920 --> 23:15.956
Whoa!

23:21.560 --> 23:22.630
Got you.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.999
He's a monster.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.995
Keep him away.
Stay away, scary beast.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.674
Ferdinand!
Paco!

23:35.840 --> 23:37.069
They think I'm the beast.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.357
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

23:41.200 --> 23:43.635
Get back to the farm.
I'll hold them off.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.153
Hey, I'm not done
with you people.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.309
Let's go this way.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.874
Oh, no.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.030
Oh.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.950
Okay.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.793
Think thin.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.194
Ooh.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.438
Step light.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.752
You are a feather.

24:34.920 --> 24:37.196
A 2,000-pound feather.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.160
Slow...

25:42.680 --> 25:43.875
There he is!

25:45.920 --> 25:47.320
Cash or credit?

25:52.760 --> 25:56.231
No! This is not necessary.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.074
You don't have to do this.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.760
- It was an accident.
- Ferdinand!

26:02.120 --> 26:04.112
Stop! You're hurting him.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.352
Nina!

26:08.440 --> 26:09.590
No!

26:10.920 --> 26:12.479
Stop!
No, no, no.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.517
Stay back. Stay back.
Please. Let me take him home.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.558
He's gentle.
Gentle?

26:16.760 --> 26:19.434
He's a wild animal.
Look what he's done.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.432
We have to take him away,
honey.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.355
<i>Señor Moreno.</i>

26:24.440 --> 26:26.875
I think I have something
you need to see.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.475
No!
Wait. Nina. Nina!

26:29.640 --> 26:31.472
Stop! Please!

26:31.640 --> 26:32.915
Ferdinand!

26:33.040 --> 26:34.030
Nina!

26:34.120 --> 26:36.430
Ferdinand.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.034
Ferdinand!

26:38.240 --> 26:39.560
Ferdinand.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.430
No!

28:06.400 --> 28:08.835
Oh, no.
No, not back here. No, no, no.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.713
This can't be happening.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.753
I need to get outta here.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.519
Stop the truck!
Stop the truck!

28:14.680 --> 28:17.400
There's been a mistake. Stop!

28:17.480 --> 28:19.790
Oy! He's going to tear
that truck apart.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.633
<i>What did I tell you,
Señor Moreno?</i>

28:21.760 --> 28:22.750
He's a beast.

28:26.880 --> 28:27.870
Get the calming goat.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.036
Where is the calming goat?

28:29.200 --> 28:30.236
Get the calming goat.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.555
Ow! Ow! Jeez Louise!

28:34.720 --> 28:37.952
Real classy, guys.
Way to treat a lady.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.236
Who's that?

28:39.440 --> 28:40.715
Hey, big guy. Name's Lupe.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.393
I'm going to be
your calming goat.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.631
My calming goat?
That's right.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.154
I'm here to soothe you now.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.516
So you can maim
and gore things later.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.878
Let's try some deep
relaxing breaths.

28:52.080 --> 28:56.120
In. Out.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.190
You're not helping.

28:58.120 --> 29:01.192
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe
you're not helping.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.760
You ever think of that? No.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.354
Because no one
ever wants to help

29:04.440 --> 29:05.999
the stinking calming goat,
right?

29:06.160 --> 29:08.834
Okay, now I got
to calm myself down.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.036
In. Out.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.238
I need to get out!
In. Out.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.473
Whoa! He is a monster.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.831
I think I fell
on something sharp.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.673
Move!
What?

29:24.840 --> 29:27.071
Goat.
Oh!

29:27.200 --> 29:29.112
Oh, sorry about that.
So sorry. So sorry.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.395
Here you go. Here you go.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.678
Watch it, buster.
You could have ki...

29:32.840 --> 29:34.035
Whoa!

29:35.440 --> 29:38.433
Holy beefaroni!
You're ginormous!

29:38.600 --> 29:40.751
Listen. It's Lupe, right?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.713
There's been a huge
misunderstanding.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.354
I really need your help here.

29:44.520 --> 29:47.911
Well, well, hold the phone.
You want my help?

29:48.080 --> 29:49.958
Yeah! That would be amazing.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.349
I've been waiting
for this moment

29:53.440 --> 29:56.831
my whole flea-bitten,
tin-chewing life, mister!

29:56.920 --> 29:57.910
You have?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.798
Oh, yes, I have!

30:01.000 --> 30:02.719
Yes, I have.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.470
Believe it or not,

30:04.560 --> 30:06.472
I'm not the world's
best calming goat.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.630
No...

30:07.800 --> 30:10.360
My true destiny
is to be a coach.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.510
Okay...

30:11.680 --> 30:14.149
Whoo! Look at those pecs.

30:14.320 --> 30:18.678
It's like two little
baby bulls inside of a bull.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.672
Moving on down the flank.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.317
Flank looks good.
A- plus on the flank.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.871
Mama like that.
Mama like that. Whew.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.310
Ow!

30:29.400 --> 30:30.390
Terrible reflexes.
We gotta work on that.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.240
What are you talking about?
Work on what? Whoa!

30:33.400 --> 30:36.234
Getting you ready for the
bullfighting ring, my friend.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.720
That's why you're here, right?

30:37.880 --> 30:40.270
No! Listen, I really need
to get back home.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.994
This is your home.
You made it.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.629
With your raw talent
and my coaching expertise...

30:44.800 --> 30:48.589
<i>we're going from
hola to olé in a day!</i>

30:48.760 --> 30:50.558
No, that is not gonna happen.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.833
Oh. Stop it with the modesty.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.595
You're the bull who destroyed
a whole village, right?

30:55.760 --> 30:57.558
Wrong! It was an accident.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.234
And did you really eat a baby?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.914
You think I ate a baby?

31:01.080 --> 31:02.719
Not denying it. Interesting.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.276
Denying it!
Definitely denying it.

31:05.520 --> 31:09.230
<i>Whoo!
He's a brick, uh, house</i>

31:10.440 --> 31:12.636
I can't wait to show you off
to the rest of the guys.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.120
They're going
to fertilize the yard.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.680
No, no, no. Lupe, wait.

31:15.840 --> 31:16.990
You really don't have to...

31:17.560 --> 31:18.550
Oh. Uh...

31:20.880 --> 31:22.712
Hey, guys. How ya doing?

31:22.880 --> 31:24.280
Lupe in the house.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.755
You suck, Lupe!

31:25.920 --> 31:29.357
Oh, yeah? I used to suck,
but not anymore.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.272
Let me introduce you
to the new guy.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.000
He's a monster
and I'm his coach.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.350
And did I mention

31:35.440 --> 31:39.036
that he is my closest
and dearest BFF...

31:39.200 --> 31:40.475
What did you say
your name was?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.552
Ferdinand? Is that you?

31:42.720 --> 31:45.440
Hey!
That is a ridiculous name.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.080
Tell him your real name,
killer.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.072
Yeah, it's me, Ferdinand.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.190
Hey, guys.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.039
Wait a minute.
You know these chumps?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.431
Whoo! Little Ferdinand.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.791
You've had a growth spurt.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.316
Suddenly I regret every time
I called you weirdo.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.637
Don't sweat it, Bones.
We're good.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.599
My gosh! What have
they been feeding you?

32:04.760 --> 32:06.353
Oh, hey. Guapo?

32:06.520 --> 32:08.432
That's right.
The one and only.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.034
Ah, I get it.

32:10.240 --> 32:13.711
You try to come back here
and intimidate us?

32:13.880 --> 32:15.314
'Cause let me
tell you something.

32:15.480 --> 32:19.474
I am not intimidated
by your freakish hugeness!

32:19.640 --> 32:21.279
Oh, mama.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.590
I don't know you...

32:22.760 --> 32:25.878
but I'm not scared of ya,
you sorry sack of meat.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.600
You're an affront
to my nostrils.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.757
Angus,
you're talking to his butt.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.194
Oh.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.354
I will not take any lip from
the flea-bitten likes of you,

32:35.440 --> 32:36.760
you wee goat.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.872
Now you're talking to my butt.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.275
Aah! Go and boil your head,
ya bunch of bampos.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.476
I'm away.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.470
Uh, a few new faces
around here since I left, huh?

32:49.560 --> 32:51.313
Hello, Maquina. Hi!

32:51.480 --> 32:55.360
He was created in a lab.
A Franken-bull.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.876
Says nothing, feels nothing.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.155
You seem fun.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.516
Look what the goat dragged in.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.750
Hey, Val.

33:05.960 --> 33:06.996
Valiente?

33:07.160 --> 33:09.675
He remembers. Oh, I'm touched.

33:09.800 --> 33:10.790
Hey!

33:10.960 --> 33:12.076
Oh. Didn't see you there,
Bones.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.311
What do you mean you didn't
see me? Oh, I get it.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.550
'Cause I'm small.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.752
You know what you are?
A sizeist.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.032
Guess some things
never change.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.271
Look at you. All grown up.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.517
When you ran away with your
tail between your legs...

33:25.680 --> 33:27.194
I never thought
I'd see you back here.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.720
That makes two of us.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.996
Nah, I get it.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.072
Now that
you're a big tough guy,

33:32.160 --> 33:33.594
you think you're better
than me.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.353
What?
Correction, Valerie.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.240
Actually, he knows
he's better than you.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.834
Ain't that right, F-Bomb?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.195
I didn't say that.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.874
You said it with your eyes.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.673
Well, I'm glad you're back.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.559
You are?
Oh, yeah.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.679
Good to have a real bull
around here for once.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.519
It'll make me look even better

33:51.600 --> 33:54.195
when I beat you to a pulp
inside the ring.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.192
Welcome back, Ferdinand.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.720
Wow. He really hates you.
That was insane.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.910
They all hate me.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.398
Yeah, they hate you.
They hate me.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.956
They hate each other.
A lot of hate.

34:08.120 --> 34:11.112
It crushes your soul if you
let yourself think about it.

34:14.520 --> 34:15.510
Oh, well.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.434
Come on, pal.
Let me show you your new digs.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.270
This is the one.
Ooh.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.672
Get that big butt in there.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.353
Oh, that's heavy. Get in!

34:31.719 --> 34:33.677
Ow!
Isn't this great?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.760
It's smaller than I remember.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.274
Oh, you don't like it?

34:37.360 --> 34:39.511
You know where I live?
A bucket.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.234
And there it is.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.277
Took the liberty
of moving my stuff in,

34:43.360 --> 34:45.033
hope you don't mind.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.590
Wait! I know
what our place needs.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.473
Little feminine touch.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.791
A little something
from me to you.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.354
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

35:01.760 --> 35:04.798
Little bit of regurgitation.

35:06.720 --> 35:10.509
Nighty-night, bestie.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.239
No, seriously,
there are bed bugs

35:12.320 --> 35:13.834
and they are vicious.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.390
Huh?

35:52.720 --> 35:55.189
Wow. You weren't kidding
about the bugs.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.516
He saw us. Stay still!

35:56.640 --> 35:57.630
Hey! Why would you stop?

35:57.720 --> 35:58.836
Go back.
We have to do something.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.240
All right,
let's do it old school.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.275
Um... Are you trying
to steal my stuff?

36:08.440 --> 36:10.193
Oh, no. We'd never
do something like that.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.750
Nope. Not us.
You have offended us, sir!

36:12.920 --> 36:15.389
I'm sorry, little guys.
I feel terrible.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.119
Ow!
Don't fall for it, Ferd.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.640
They're filthy weasels.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.757
Hey! We're not filthy weasels.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.320
We're filthy hedgehogs.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.880
She knows what we are.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.839
Yeah.
Beady-eyed, little thieves.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.595
We're not thieves.
We're survivors.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.716
Balls!

36:30.800 --> 36:31.790
Let's roll!

36:31.880 --> 36:33.837
No, wait! Hold on! The flower!

36:36.880 --> 36:38.109
Please don't chew on us!

36:38.280 --> 36:40.920
My greatest fear
is death by chew.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.594
Step back, beast!
Come on.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.359
You wanna dance? Let's dance.
Oh, hey!

36:44.520 --> 36:45.920
Don't tempt me, pinecone.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.150
Will you stop?
Eat quills!

36:47.320 --> 36:49.277
And you,
I'm not eating anyone.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.193
Ha!
Wait, wait. Hold on.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.913
You're not like
the other meatheads, are you?

36:54.080 --> 36:55.116
Don't be fooled, sister.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.272
Where do you think the
word bully comes from, hmm?

36:57.400 --> 36:58.470
It ain't from chickens!

36:58.640 --> 37:02.680
No, no. Look at him!
He's soft and sweet.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.275
Like butter.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.432
Thanks. I think.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.637
Let's start over. I'm Una.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.750
I'm Dos.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.360
And I'm Cuatro.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.239
Oh. What happened to Tres?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.232
We do not speak of Tres.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.310
Oh.

37:18.680 --> 37:19.830
Sorry.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.515
Look, you can
take the food if you want.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.716
I'm not hungry.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.870
Oh, really?

37:24.960 --> 37:26.155
Whoo-hoo! You don't
have to tell me twice.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.074
Ah-bup-bup-bup.
The flower stays.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.960
Good-bye. For now.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.429
Let me give you a boost.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.034
Oh, thank you!

37:37.200 --> 37:38.873
Nah, I don't know.
Ow! Okay, fine.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.599
Ooh! Free ride!

37:41.000 --> 37:42.036
Great to meet you!

37:42.200 --> 37:43.475
What a nice bull.

37:43.640 --> 37:44.710
Oh, yeah.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.837
Sucker won't survive
a day in this place.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.876
Hmm.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.599
I gotta get back home.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.920
Get back. Get back!
Ow, ow, ow. Get back!

38:08.880 --> 38:10.678
Where are my teeth?

38:29.520 --> 38:31.398
All right, I'm going home!

38:31.520 --> 38:32.510
I'm going...

38:35.160 --> 38:38.278
Holy cow, that hurt.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.680
Face is on fire.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.634
Klaus, Greta, look!

38:42.840 --> 38:43.956
Looks like somebody

38:44.040 --> 38:46.430
wants to come
to our side of the fence.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.434
Silly moo-moo.
He doesn't know the rules.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.676
Hey, can you guys help me out?

38:52.840 --> 38:54.354
How do I get
to the other side?

38:55.040 --> 38:57.396
Hmm. How do you get
to the other side?

38:57.600 --> 39:00.274
Oh, let me ponder
this question a little bit.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.516
Mmm...

39:01.600 --> 39:03.956
Spoiler alert! You don't!

39:05.600 --> 39:08.434
Hoof bump. Hoof bump, Klaus.
Hoof bump, Greta.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.638
See, this is the beautiful
horsey side.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.790
And that

39:14.880 --> 39:15.950
is the stinky bull side.
Yeah.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.072
Beautiful horsies stay here,

39:18.160 --> 39:20.356
and you ugly beasts
stay there.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.274
Don't even think of coming
over to our side.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.714
Or we'll alert the humans.

39:24.920 --> 39:25.990
Yeah.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.958
Sucks to be you.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.794
There is no escape.
Nothing gets past us.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.030
Never ever never.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.431
Never ever, ever, ever.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.630
We have eyes

39:35.720 --> 39:36.790
- on the back of our heads.
- Yeah.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.394
The nose of a kitten.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.034
The flexibility of a monkey.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.915
Ears like that
of a cocker spaniel.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.030
Good one.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.476
Shoo! Shoo, shoo!
Go on, stinky one.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.552
Have a nice day
smelling terrible.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.995
Yeah.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.193
I bet his parents
weren't even related.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.835
Wow. People around here
are pigs. Aah!

40:18.920 --> 40:21.116
Aah! Sardine can!

40:24.800 --> 40:25.790
Oh, that turned.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.513
El Primero is coming.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.875
El Primero is coming. Come on!

40:29.040 --> 40:30.474
What?
El Primero is coming here?

40:31.360 --> 40:33.750
El Primero? El Primero!

40:33.920 --> 40:36.594
El Primero!
Oh. Here?

40:36.760 --> 40:39.320
El Primero!

40:39.480 --> 40:41.358
El Primero! El Primero!

40:41.520 --> 40:42.510
El Primero!
What?

40:42.680 --> 40:43.670
El Primero. El Primero.
Ow, ow, ow.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.750
El Primero.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.593
Ow!

40:48.040 --> 40:49.030
El Primero.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.316
Oh! Hey. Uh, sorry about that.

40:51.480 --> 40:52.834
El Primero.

40:52.920 --> 40:53.956
Who?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.515
Big P is in the house!

41:02.680 --> 41:04.956
There are many
great bullfighters in Spain...

41:05.120 --> 41:08.079
but there is only one
El Primero.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.471
You got this, Guap.
You got this. You got this.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.280
Hey, Guapo. No pressure.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.920
Oh, mama!

41:15.080 --> 41:17.595
Don't let that jerk
get in your head, Guap.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.160
Where is he? Show me!

41:19.240 --> 41:20.310
Point me
in the right direction.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.994
Excuse me.
Goat coming through.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.674
El Primero.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.200
<i>Olé.</i>

41:38.680 --> 41:40.797
El Primero! Love you, man.

41:43.640 --> 41:47.520
<i>El Primero, señor!
Welcome to Casa del Toro.</i>

41:47.680 --> 41:49.194
What an honor to have you here

41:49.280 --> 41:50.873
<i>at my humble home.
Es un honor.</i>

41:51.040 --> 41:54.238
I do not shake.
My hands are my instruments.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.040
As are my arms, legs,
chest, feet.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.590
And buttocks.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.035
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

42:04.320 --> 42:05.754
<i>Uh... Of course, señor.</i>

42:05.960 --> 42:08.270
I am here to select a bull.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.000
<i>¡Uno!
One?</i>

42:12.160 --> 42:14.834
My final fight. One bull.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.880
The best bull.
Against the best bullfighter.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.360
No, of course.
The best...

42:20.520 --> 42:21.715
for the best.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.916
<i>Sí. I understand.
But we have...</i>

42:23.080 --> 42:25.072
The best against the best.
No, we will...

42:25.240 --> 42:28.039
To see who's
the best-est-est-est.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.112
I have a new bull. I think
will be perfect for you.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.190
Zip!

42:31.360 --> 42:33.431
Only El Primero knows
who is the best.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.115
Sorry. I meant no disrespect.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.279
And yet, I felt disrespected.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.194
Now, what is the best bedroom
in the house?

42:42.280 --> 42:43.475
Uh...

42:43.560 --> 42:45.438
Mine, I suppose.

42:45.600 --> 42:46.829
I'll take that one.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.678
Let me know
when the bulls are ready.

42:56.320 --> 42:57.879
<i>Get the bulls ready
for Señor Primero.</i>

43:17.960 --> 43:19.189
<i>Vamos! Vamos!</i>

43:19.280 --> 43:20.555
Okay, listen up, F-Train.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.870
I've got exactly 30 seconds

43:21.960 --> 43:23.314
to teach you everything
about bullfighting.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.755
Number one. Don't get hit.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.559
Number two.
Destroy anything that moves.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.120
And number three...

43:28.200 --> 43:29.759
Actually, that's it.
It's not that complicated.

43:29.880 --> 43:30.916
Oh, trust me, Lupe.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.799
This is not for me.
Relax, buddy.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.320
It's a slam dunk!

43:34.480 --> 43:36.312
El Primero is going
to take one look

43:36.400 --> 43:38.995
at your big beautiful
hugeness and boom!

43:39.160 --> 43:41.152
You're on your way
to the big show.

43:41.320 --> 43:44.916
I can already hear the crowds
in Madrid chanting your name.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.834
Lupe! Lupe! Lupe!

43:49.920 --> 43:51.673
I want the new bull out first.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.634
Well, well.

43:54.720 --> 43:58.430
Looks like
someone's the teacher's pet.

43:58.600 --> 44:01.832
News flash! No one likes
the teacher's pet.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.629
You know I've been waiting
for this day for a long time.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.235
It's gonna get messy,
Ferdinand.

44:15.760 --> 44:17.319
This is it.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.073
Come on! Bring it on!

44:19.240 --> 44:22.233
Let's go! Let's go out there
and give it 110%.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.432
Hey, that better not be
my bucket, Guap.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.199
It's definitely your bucket.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.999
Ugh, gross.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.719
Hey, hey, buddy.
You feeling good?

44:32.840 --> 44:33.830
No. Not really.

44:33.960 --> 44:36.111
Okay. Cool.
Try to have some fun with it.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.555
I'll be sitting
in the front row.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.199
I call it the splash zone.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.119
I'll see ya later.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.434
Impress me.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.080
Release the bulls!

44:58.640 --> 45:00.359
- Nope. Nope. No, no, no.
- Get outta the way!

45:00.520 --> 45:01.636
I'm gonna sit this one out.
Get out there!

45:01.840 --> 45:03.194
Let's go! Get in there.
No, I'll pass, thanks.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.680
Let's go. Move!
You guys go ahead.

45:04.760 --> 45:06.319
Move!

45:06.400 --> 45:09.472
For the glory of Scotland!

45:11.000 --> 45:13.356
Whoo-hoo!
Smash them in the head!

45:14.840 --> 45:15.830
Whoa!

45:21.600 --> 45:22.590
Watch out.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.590
Hey.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.671
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

45:42.880 --> 45:43.996
Outta my way, Bones!

45:46.400 --> 45:48.517
Ha! That didn't hurt.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.632
Ferdinand,
El Primero is watching.

45:50.720 --> 45:51.756
You gotta hit something.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.116
Nope. Actually, I'm gonna pass
on the violence.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.511
Well, if you don't hit them,
they're going to hit you.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.512
Gangway!
Whoa!

46:00.360 --> 46:02.920
You finally ready to fight?
Come on!

46:03.640 --> 46:04.835
Guapo with the hit.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.639
Take that, Valiente.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.710
You think you got
what it takes, Guapo?

46:09.800 --> 46:11.359
Then show that to El Primero.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.831
Oh, I will. I'll show him who
the real champ is around here.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.474
Keep it together, Guapo.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.430
Bull down!

46:24.400 --> 46:25.436
Aah!

46:26.080 --> 46:27.275
Hey! Get off me!

46:31.000 --> 46:31.990
Enough.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.198
The bullfight is a battle
of wits and strength.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.272
These bulls have nothing.

46:37.480 --> 46:40.632
<i>Espere, señor.
Give the bulls another chance.</i>

46:40.800 --> 46:42.951
My final fight is in two days.

46:43.120 --> 46:45.077
If I do not find the best bull

46:45.160 --> 46:47.038
for the best bullfighter
by then...

46:47.240 --> 46:51.393
no bullfighter will ever
use your ranch again.

46:56.880 --> 46:59.520
What did you think you were
doing back there, you numpty?

46:59.680 --> 47:01.114
Are you trying
to make us look bad?

47:01.200 --> 47:02.554
Because you made us look bad.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.791
You made us look real bad.

47:04.960 --> 47:07.350
I was just trying
to help Guapo.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.671
Help? There's no helping.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.912
Oh, you are the worst
fighting bull

47:13.000 --> 47:14.559
I have ever partially seen.

47:14.720 --> 47:17.952
Well, that's because he isn't
a real fighter.

47:18.040 --> 47:21.431
Oh, little Ferdinand
had a growth spurt.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.638
But he's still the same scared
little coward he always was.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.360
Why does not wanting to fight
mean I'm scared?

47:27.520 --> 47:30.035
Yeah. That's ridonculous.
Look at him.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.038
My boy is a killing machine.
Right, Ferd?

47:32.240 --> 47:34.277
No, I'm not a killing machine.

47:34.360 --> 47:35.919
I've been trying
to tell you, Lupe.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.520
You didn't destroy a village?

47:37.680 --> 47:39.478
And I didn't eat a baby.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.954
Not even a nibble?

47:42.120 --> 47:44.476
Eh...
Are you trying to tell me

47:44.560 --> 47:47.314
that you don't want to fight
for glory in the ring?

47:47.480 --> 47:48.800
I'm not a fighter.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.077
I don't understand that
at all.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.630
Yeah, me either.
What else is there?

47:53.760 --> 47:54.910
Whoo!

47:55.160 --> 47:56.719
Whoo-hoo!

47:56.960 --> 47:59.350
Look who got picked
by El Primero.

47:59.560 --> 48:00.914
Who's the bull now?

48:01.000 --> 48:04.471
Uh-huh. Guapo going to
the big show, that's right.

48:04.640 --> 48:05.630
What in the blazes?

48:05.800 --> 48:08.599
I have no idea
what happened back there.

48:08.680 --> 48:09.716
No clue.

48:09.880 --> 48:12.315
But it must have been epic!

48:12.400 --> 48:15.199
What in the deuce
is happening?

48:15.280 --> 48:16.475
Somebody narrate.

48:16.640 --> 48:19.792
I'm gonna be famous! Whoo!

48:20.000 --> 48:21.320
Oh, no!

48:21.480 --> 48:24.439
So long, suckers!

48:24.600 --> 48:27.399
Wait a second.
Where are they taking him?

48:27.720 --> 48:28.710
Uh...

48:29.000 --> 48:32.072
They're taking Guap
to the chop house.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.829
You.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.391
You messed with his head.
This is on you.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.994
Oh, please.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.072
Guapo was never going
to make it to the ring.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.190
We all knew that.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.920
And so, because of that,
he deserves to go there?

48:58.120 --> 49:00.271
Listen to me, Flower Bull.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.669
Things have changed
around here

49:01.760 --> 49:02.750
since you ran away.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.600
Now, you're either a fighter
or you're meat.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.434
Later, meat.

49:59.400 --> 50:00.675
Bones?
Ferdinand!

50:01.160 --> 50:03.038
I'm not...
You okay?

50:03.640 --> 50:05.359
Why wouldn't I be okay?

50:05.560 --> 50:08.917
I just have, uh... allergies.

50:09.080 --> 50:11.549
Oh, yeah, sure.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.279
You know,
there's a lot of pollen

50:13.360 --> 50:14.396
in the air this time of year.

50:14.560 --> 50:17.632
That's right, a lot of pollen.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.678
Makes my eyes water.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.395
Hey...

50:21.960 --> 50:24.156
I'm really sorry about Guapo.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.312
I know you guys were friends.

50:27.440 --> 50:30.035
Bulls don't have friends,
Ferd.

50:30.200 --> 50:32.590
Guapo was my competition,
okay?

50:32.680 --> 50:33.670
I'm fine.

50:34.120 --> 50:35.998
Oh, okay.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.197
I mean, how many times
did I tell him...

50:38.360 --> 50:39.874
"You gotta get
outta your head, man.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.952
"You gotta control
your fears," you know.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.634
But he wouldn't listen.

50:44.120 --> 50:45.190
Sorry.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.837
It's okay to feel bad, Bones.

50:49.600 --> 50:52.513
You won't tell anyone
about this, will you?

50:52.680 --> 50:54.399
I won't say a word.

50:54.560 --> 50:56.950
But if you ever
wanna talk about,

50:57.040 --> 50:58.838
I don't know, allergies?

50:59.960 --> 51:01.155
I'm around.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.160
Thanks, Ferdinand.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.194
You're okay.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.792
Hey, Ferd, look...

51:08.360 --> 51:11.080
if you don't wanna
end up like Guap...

51:11.240 --> 51:13.960
you gotta get your horns
in the game, man.

51:14.120 --> 51:16.840
That's the one thing
Valiente's got right.

51:21.680 --> 51:25.469
I'm comin' for ya,
you bleedin' barrel!

51:25.600 --> 51:27.319
Oh!

51:30.160 --> 51:32.834
And the barrel wins
another round!

51:33.000 --> 51:34.480
Give up, dude.

51:35.320 --> 51:38.438
Hey, big guy, you're on.
Mr. Matador is watching.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.355
I got this. Uh-huh.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.670
I'm ready. Let's go.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.354
Come on!
In. Out. In. Out.

51:51.800 --> 51:52.790
Hmm!

51:55.880 --> 51:57.473
Come on, Klaus.
Come on, Greta.

51:57.640 --> 52:01.270
<i>Und up! Two, three, four.
Pirouette!</i>

52:01.360 --> 52:02.919
Oh, jealous?

52:03.080 --> 52:04.719
Good prancing, boys.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.073
Oh, yes.
That's the one.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.674
Look alive, F-Stop.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.151
We got 24 hours to whip you
into shape for El Primero.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.714
From now on, you're not soft.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.315
You're not a flower bull.
You're a killing machine.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.039
I'll finally get you
this time, barrel.

52:21.200 --> 52:22.190
Say it with me.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.999
I am a...

52:24.200 --> 52:25.190
Bunny!

52:25.360 --> 52:26.953
Bunny? No, not bunny.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.514
Barrel death!

52:28.680 --> 52:30.717
Stop! Angus, look out!

52:35.440 --> 52:37.671
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

52:58.400 --> 52:59.390
Huh?

53:02.600 --> 53:03.636
Oh, no!

53:07.960 --> 53:10.794
Come on, little guy!
Come on! Come back!

53:11.000 --> 53:12.798
Don't go into the light!

53:17.600 --> 53:19.239
Live, bunny, live!

53:19.320 --> 53:21.073
Ha!

53:21.160 --> 53:24.198
Sorry I almost killed you. Ow.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.915
You're not helping
your reputation here, pal,

53:30.000 --> 53:31.992
apologizing
to the bunny rabbit.

53:32.160 --> 53:33.753
But taking out another bull...

53:33.920 --> 53:36.116
that's an energy we can use!

53:36.200 --> 53:37.190
Who did that?

53:37.280 --> 53:40.512
Who pushed me?

53:42.120 --> 53:45.033
Ooh!
It was you, wasn't it?

53:45.240 --> 53:47.072
Actually, Angus, it was me.

53:47.840 --> 53:51.470
Oh, I'm doomed, I'm doomed,
I'm doomed!

53:51.640 --> 53:53.711
Primero picks a bull
tomorrow...

53:53.880 --> 53:55.951
and I'm talking
to a bloomin' tractor.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.759
That's just your nerves
talking, Angus.

53:57.880 --> 53:58.870
You're gonna be fine.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.475
No, I'm not.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.075
First Guapo, now me. I'm next!

54:04.720 --> 54:07.679
Can I tell you
my terrible secret? Hmm?

54:08.480 --> 54:10.199
Can I whisper it in your ear?

54:10.520 --> 54:11.636
Sure.

54:14.240 --> 54:18.473
I cannot see very well. Shh!

54:19.280 --> 54:22.796
Once they find out,
it's all over for Angus.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.555
I'm a dead bull walking. Done!

54:25.720 --> 54:27.712
Finito! Kaput!
Angus, wait. Whoa!

54:28.000 --> 54:29.036
Oh.

54:29.160 --> 54:32.312
What a surprise. I can see.

54:33.120 --> 54:35.794
Look, a rock! Another rock!

54:36.000 --> 54:38.310
And the world's
most ugliest dog.

54:39.000 --> 54:39.990
Huh?

54:40.480 --> 54:42.233
And there it is.

54:42.400 --> 54:43.993
My nemesis!

54:44.160 --> 54:47.551
I'm coming for you,
ya wee wooden devil!

54:48.120 --> 54:49.918
Ha-hah!

54:50.480 --> 54:51.675
I did it!

54:51.840 --> 54:55.311
I finally beat you!
Beat you, beat you, beat you!

54:57.560 --> 54:59.233
Oh, look at that.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.909
That's spectacular.

55:11.840 --> 55:14.833
You've given me
a fighting chance, Ferdinand.

55:15.040 --> 55:16.918
Why would you do such a thing?

55:17.120 --> 55:20.352
If we don't look out
for each other, who will?

55:20.520 --> 55:22.910
Besides, it wasn't
that big of a deal.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.639
It was for me.

55:32.160 --> 55:34.959
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry to kill the mood.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.077
Can I steal you for a second?

55:41.120 --> 55:43.635
I got tears, honestly.

55:43.800 --> 55:46.076
Really did a good thing
out there, pal.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.560
Yeah, come here.

55:48.120 --> 55:49.474
Somethin' I wanna tell ya.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.756
Stop helping the competition!
Ow!

55:52.920 --> 55:56.231
What, are you gonna give
Valiente a hoof massage now?

55:56.400 --> 55:58.278
Lupe, I'm not some...
I get it.

55:58.440 --> 56:00.511
You don't like
the bullfighting.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.990
It's because you're hung up
on the blood

56:03.080 --> 56:04.434
and the guts
and the maiming...

56:04.600 --> 56:06.717
and the gore
and the senseless violence.

56:06.840 --> 56:07.830
Do you have a point?

56:08.320 --> 56:12.030
My point is, it's about more
than just smashing heads.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.830
It's about rhythm
and footwork and grace.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.912
Don't just think of it
as a fight.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.675
Think of it like a dance.

56:24.760 --> 56:26.433
A bull dancing?

56:26.600 --> 56:28.557
Is this some kind
of hilarious joke

56:28.640 --> 56:29.960
designed to make me laugh?

56:30.120 --> 56:31.110
You see, horses,

56:31.240 --> 56:33.038
we have the beautifulest legs
for the dancing.

56:33.240 --> 56:34.913
Bulls have short,
stubby legs.

56:35.120 --> 56:36.270
Yeah. Look at me.

56:36.440 --> 56:38.033
Moo, moo, moo.

56:38.840 --> 56:41.958
Go eat a schnitzel,
you pasty-faced glue stick!

56:42.120 --> 56:43.349
It's okay, Lupe,
they're right.

56:43.520 --> 56:45.989
I mean, how could
a big, clumsy bull

56:46.080 --> 56:47.639
ever do something like this?

56:52.480 --> 56:55.632
Whoo! Check out my boy
cuttin' a rug.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.598
Yeah!
That was good.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.558
You call that dancing? Ha!

56:59.720 --> 57:03.077
<i>Nein! This is dancing.</i>

57:12.320 --> 57:14.630
Three against one
is hardly fair.

57:14.800 --> 57:16.553
Lupe, get my pipes!

57:25.120 --> 57:27.555
Well, put that in your kilts
and smoke it!

57:28.440 --> 57:30.636
Don't celebrate yet,
you rump roast!

57:30.720 --> 57:32.120
Try this!

57:45.680 --> 57:47.637
Ooh, I hate those horses!

57:47.800 --> 57:49.075
It's show time.

57:50.880 --> 57:52.109
I'm going in!

57:53.560 --> 57:54.994
<i>All hooks to the coatrack</i>

57:55.080 --> 57:57.037
<i>Why, why would I hold back?</i>

57:57.160 --> 57:58.435
<i>Click-tack like a Kodak</i>

57:58.520 --> 58:00.318
<i>Just try and stop me
Try and stop me, whoo</i>

58:00.720 --> 58:02.154
<i>Long time to the climax</i>

58:02.240 --> 58:04.232
<i>Fine dime, girl
Let me shine that</i>

58:04.320 --> 58:05.595
<i>Oh, no with the hold back</i>

58:05.680 --> 58:07.717
<i>Just try and stop me
Try and stop me, whoo</i>

58:09.680 --> 58:11.239
<i>I'm on a new trip</i>

58:13.000 --> 58:14.753
<i>A rocket to the moon ship</i>

58:21.640 --> 58:22.676
<i>Watch me</i>

58:27.920 --> 58:29.149
Whoa!
Yeah!

58:36.640 --> 58:38.040
<i>Watch me, watch me</i>

58:41.560 --> 58:42.550
<i>Watch me</i>

58:43.640 --> 58:45.757
<i>A rocket to the moon ship</i>

58:45.880 --> 58:48.156
Hey, watch where
you're stepping, dummkopf.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.390
Who are you calling dummkopf?

58:49.560 --> 58:50.710
You have four left hooves.

58:54.600 --> 58:55.829
<i>Watch me</i>

58:55.920 --> 58:57.240
Yeah!

58:57.400 --> 59:00.154
I've fallen
and I can't giddyup.

59:00.320 --> 59:01.436
We did it, lads!

59:01.640 --> 59:02.756
Oh, yes!
Yeah!

59:03.240 --> 59:04.720
Nice one! Nice one!

59:04.800 --> 59:06.359
That's right,
'cause we're bulls.

59:06.560 --> 59:09.871
Go on, horses, prance.
'Cause you can't dance.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.753
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

59:12.240 --> 59:14.675
Aw. Why didn't we
do that sooner?

59:14.840 --> 59:17.799
Felt good to put those
show ponies in their place.

59:17.960 --> 59:21.237
I haven't laughed like that
since ever.

59:21.440 --> 59:23.397
Maquina, are you smiling?

59:23.560 --> 59:24.880
That's what it is!

59:25.080 --> 59:27.470
A smile!

59:27.560 --> 59:30.394
Laugh your way right into
the chop house.

59:30.560 --> 59:31.914
That's where you're headed.

59:32.360 --> 59:35.512
No, no! Not if we
get outta here, guys.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.875
There are places out there

59:36.960 --> 59:38.440
where you don't
get pushed around...

59:38.600 --> 59:40.751
or shipped to a chop house
for being yourself.

59:41.280 --> 59:43.351
If it's so great out there,

59:43.440 --> 59:45.318
why did they
send you back here?

59:45.480 --> 59:48.075
Yeah, Ferd, why did they
send you back here?

59:48.240 --> 59:50.072
Well, because...
Because you're a bull.

59:50.240 --> 59:52.914
You think you're different,
but you're not.

59:57.320 --> 59:59.994
Our only way out is to beat
the matador in the ring.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.793
And that's what I'm gonna do.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.678
But by all means, ballerinas,
keep dancing.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.992
Tomorrow, I'll be
on the winner's truck.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.276
Don't listen to him, guys.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.000
He's right. We're bulls.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.072
This is the only place for us.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.550
Sorry, Ferd.
I gotta get back to training.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.120
You should, too.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.117
- Guys!
- Ferd, pal...

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.511
I think they got a point.
We're running outta time.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.831
They wanna stay, I get it.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.232
But I'm leaving here tonight.
Let's bust outta here, Lupe.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.591
And go where?

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.638
This is it, Ferd.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.360
It's a dog-eat-dog,
bull-fight-bull,

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.352
everybody-hate-goat world.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.557
It doesn't have
to be that way.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.835
I'll take you to my home.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.394
It's different there.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.029
And Nina...
Nina will love you.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.352
Who's this Nina?

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.274
And what's love?

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.556
So you'll come?

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.316
Do you really think...

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.676
I'm just gonna throw away
my three-day dream

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.594
of training a champion bull?
Oh.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.512
Of course I am!
It was a stupid dream!

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.954
I have a new dream.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.794
Busting out of this stink hole
with my best friend!

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.112
Just one problem,
this joint is locked up tight.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.551
No one gets outta this place.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.638
Actually, that's not true.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.117
A bull wanting to escape
Casa del Toro?

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.078
<i>Hah, good luck with that,
amigo.</i>

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.709
Look, I could
really use your help.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.235
Do you know a way outta here?

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.199
Yeah. We might know a way.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.317
But what's in it for us?

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.714
Ooh.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.280
Really?

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.430
Excuse me,

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.671
you're re-gifting my gift
to the gerbils?

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.638
First of all, hedgehogs.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.679
And you will never,
ever buy us

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.558
with a cheap piece of junk.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.078
Ooh!

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.231
No, don't do it! Resist!

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.880
I can't help it!

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.395
Mmm! It gives me the happies.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.916
Okay, yeah.
Way to play hardball, Cuatro.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.510
That's the plan?

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.439
You want me to go
through the house?

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.472
If we get caught
inside that house,

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.590
we're toast.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.955
Oh, I love toast.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.554
You wanna get out of here,
don't you?

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.155
Okay. Let's do it.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.000
All right, just do
exactly what we do.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.276
Balls.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.759
Yeah, maybe don't do
exactly as we do.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.594
Now, you go through there.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.677
Me? Through there?

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.000
Uh, have you seen these hips?

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.514
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.717
I can't! I can't!

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.192
I'm stuck! Wait!

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.194
Get your hoof...
Squeeze in!

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.680
...out of my mouth.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.593
It's not working.
It's not working.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.477
Okay, all right,
we gotta do something, guys.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.757
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.718
<i>Uno, do', tres, cuatro</i>

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.554
Whoa, look at
the cute squirrels.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.710
What?

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.720
We are hedgehogs!

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.630
Okay, it's a straight shot

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.870
through the kitchen
to the front door.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.199
And then, you're home free.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.396
Piece of cake.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.074
I love cake.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.231
He's coming down,
he's coming down!

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.595
Run!

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.593
Can you just try to be
a little more quiet?

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.874
Shh.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.074
Yikes on a stick.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.438
What are you doing
with 53 swords?

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.913
Is that...?

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.280
My dad.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.713
Oh, Ferd.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.516
He was the bravest bull
I knew.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.635
He really believed
he could beat the matador.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.473
All of them did.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.397
The bull never wins.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.072
Come on, Ferd.
Let's get you home.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.989
The door to freedom.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.833
Ferd, what are you doing?

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.432
Come on, we gotta go now!

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.115
No. I can't leave.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.279
What? Ferd,
this is your only chance!

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.512
The guys back there
still think they can win.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.512
Just like my dad did.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.109
And I can't let them
end up on that wall.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.239
Guys? Everybody up, come on!

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.595
We have to go now!

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.840
Have you lost
your bloody mind?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.514
We have to get
outta here tonight!

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.876
El Primero's selecting a bull
in the morning.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.953
We're not going anywhere.
I'm gonna take his butt down.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.032
No! You don't
wanna get selected.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.554
Trust me,
it's a death sentence.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.076
- Rubbish! Not if you win.
- That's just it.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.277
No bull wins. Ever.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.880
I was in Moreno's house,
I saw it.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.269
Jings! Crivens!
And help ma boab!

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.477
And there's a lot more
where that came from.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.550
A lot more.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.154
There's really no way to win?

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.676
You get to fight
in a big fancy arena...

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.514
but I'm telling you,
it's just another chop house.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.392
Why would I believe
a coward...

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.597
who thinks the only way out
is through the back door?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.315
Are you crazy?
Did you not hear what I said?

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.234
Bulls fight or they go down.
That's how the world works.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.312
There's nothing left
for you here, Valiente.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.675
Come with us.
No!

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.240
What are you so afraid of?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.631
I'm not afraid of anything!

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.915
Come on, fight me.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.958
I'm not gonna fight you,
Valiente.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.554
Coward!

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.710
Fight!

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.720
Valiente, stop!

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.870
You're soft.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.314
Like your father.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.751
And the soft ones
always go down!

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.110
Stop!

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.033
What's going on?

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.234
That one is the best bull.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.796
I'll fight him
in Madrid tomorrow.

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:49.874
Oh, this is bad.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.792
You got selected
by El Primero.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.870
Do you know what this means?

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.269
A sword through his melon!

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.038
Horns on the wall.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:08:58.794
Exactly, Maquina.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.600
We gotta get you
outta here now!

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:05.033
Oh, no. I know that look.
No, no, don't say it.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.276
I'm not leaving.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.073
Oh! You're killing me!

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.277
Not unless everyone
is coming with me.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:13.350
Yes!

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.078
Sign me up!
I'm in!

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:17.872
Okay, you happy now?

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.394
I said everyone.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.670
Klaus, Greta...

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.354
I'm sorry
for the things I said

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:33.550
about your terrible dancing.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.791
<i>Nein. Nein. Hans...</i>

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.590
I am the horse that is full
of the shame and the regret.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.319
I cannot stay mad at you.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:43.232
<i>Kommen Sie,
you sons of stallions.</i>

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:45.232
<i>Let's Häagen Dazs it out.</i>

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.354
What is the meaning of this?

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.079
How did you get in here,
stinky bull?

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.079
Stinky hedgehogs.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:08.989
I am blinded!

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.830
<i>Adiós.</i>

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.353
Greta, Klaus,
where are you?

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.034
Hedge for one...

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.512
And hog for all!

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.913
You messed
with the wrong hogs.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.720
Okay. Let's go!

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.599
Hurry! Keep it moving!

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.795
Get to work, Ferd.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.277
This is an outrage!
Open the door!

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.875
Valiente?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.830
Valiente?

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.599
What are you doing here?

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.996
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm getting you outta here.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.240
Come on!
We don't have a lot of time.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.519
Don't you get it? Look at me!
I'm already done.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.756
Oh, sure.
That makes total sense.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.071
You're either a fighter
or you're meat, right?

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.754
That's right.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.354
It doesn't
have to be that way.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.994
You're more than just
a set of horns.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.230
Come with us.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.794
So I can...

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.634
sniff flowers and pal around
with goats?

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.359
No, that's my thing.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.716
You can live
your own life now.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.519
But not if you give up.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.791
Oh, Mama!

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.075
It's Guapo!

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.674
Valiente, come on!

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.069
Go away.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.039
Wow. I thought you were a fighter.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.919
I guess I was wrong.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.436
Where are they?

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.512
Open the door!
Get back in there.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.197
Guapo!

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.715
Guapo!

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.560
Guap... Whoa!

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.912
Oh, Ferdinand!

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.720
I did not get picked
by El Primero!

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.475
I know. And that's
a good thing, trust me.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.710
I'm gonna get you down.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.633
Thank holy goodness.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.355
I didn't think
I was going to make it.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.110
Oh, no.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.670
Ahhh! Help me!

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.160
Hang on!

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.070
Ferdinand!

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.555
Hold on, Guapo!

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.750
Don't let go! Don't let me go!

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.912
Hang on!
Don't let me go!

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.590
Val?

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.672
Thought you could use
an extra horn.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.876
Whoa!

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.396
What? What's the problem?

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.439
Nothing! You look great. Oh!

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.159
So, we getting
outta here or what?

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.311
Over here, guys!
Help!

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.310
That wasn't so bad.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.199
Yeah, quite relaxing.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.680
Watch out!

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.069
What are you guys doing?

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.469
We're trying to help you!

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.791
Well, you're doing
a terrible job!

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.675
Anyone got an ice pick?

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.430
Mama!

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.916
Here they come!

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.879
Holy cow!
Hey, guys.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.713
Guapo lives!

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.519
Okay. I deserve that.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.000
Everybody in!

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.480
You better know
how to drive this thing.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.359
We're about to find out.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.558
Okay, guys. Think thin!

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.475
We got company! Hit it!

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.470
Yeah!

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.672
Bull overboard!

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.830
Go!

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.955
Wait for me! Wait for me!

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.560
Are you seeing this, too?

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.350
If you lose my bull,
I'll fight you in the ring.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.150
Bunny!

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.074
Your turn.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.555
Go!

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.313
Come on, Angus. You can do it!

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.437
I'm a bull, not a doctor.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.270
They're getting closer.
Speed up!

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.238
I'm pressing as hard as I can!

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.993
Which way?
Hard right.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.839
I don't feel so good.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.514
Yeah.
Been there, buddy.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.396
I said right!

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.835
I thought you meant my right.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.469
We have the same right!

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.680
A convertible!

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.035
Fancy!

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.636
Get over there.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.510
My hand!

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.910
- Take the wheel.
- Who? Me?

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.830
Aah!

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.874
I got ya, hedgehog.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.840
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.752
Nothing can stop us now!

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.756
What part of Scotland
is this anyway?

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.990
This is lovely.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.560
Come on. Move it, people.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.911
I'm starving.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.355
Come on!

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.230
Let's go!

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.840
What now, Ferd?

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.670
That's it.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.274
We gotta get to the train.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.476
Guys, we gotta hoof it.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.436
Whoo!

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.000
Do what I do.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.070
Ha-ha!

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.830
Yeah, right.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.311
Sorry. Oop, my bad!

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.120
<i>I'm free to do what I want</i>

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.998

Oh! Hello, handsome.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.994
Oh, they're coming!

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.111

Oh, yeah!

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.439
Smile, Dad.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.640
Matador!

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.156
Watch out!

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:49.830
I got this.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.910
Cool!

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.070
That's it.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.993
The train!
Are you blind, laddie?

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.799
That's a bloomin' bus.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.679
That's it. Track eight.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.997
Come on, follow us! Hurry!

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.995
Move it, Guapo.

I don't wanna die
looking at your butt!

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.038
There they are! Get them!

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.151
Come on. Give me a boost.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.113
Hurry! It's leaving!

Go, go, go!

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.274
Come on, guys!

Go, go!

Move it or lose it!

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.639
I'll keep pushing.
You guys jump on!

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.353
Push, bulls. Push!

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.710
Come on, guys.

They're coming fast!

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.195
Okay, hop on!

They want you. You go first.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.080
Just go!

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.880
Whoo!
Yeah!

<i>Chaos in Madrid today...</i>

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.520
<i>as a group of runaway bulls</i>

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.954
<i>stampeded through
the city streets.</i>

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.631
<i>the fiercest of the bulls

<i>to face El Primero

Nina!

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.836
Ferd.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.480
Listen, okay.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.354
You are the bravest bull
I know.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.832
You can do this.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.640
But you're gonna
have to fight.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.477
Just this one time, Ferd.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.560
Please?

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.994
El Primero!

<i>Olé!</i>

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.870
What?

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.870
Just great!

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.319
I can't see.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.795
There, Nina!

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.280
Let him live!

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.753
Spare the bull!

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.954
Let him go!

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.238
Save the bull!
Let him go!

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.636

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.350
Ferdinand!

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.515
I thought I'd never
see you again.

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.750
Whoa.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.319
Mmm!

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.190
Huh?

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.112
Flower bull did it.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.151
Holy moly! You've multiplied.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.718
Hey, Pac-Man!
I missed you, dawg.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.952
Well, I didn't miss you.
Not even a little bit.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.391
The tail don't lie, brother.

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.838
I have got to get that fixed.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:24.391
Goat! Goat! Can't breathe.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.040
Jeez Louise!

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:31.876
Haven't you brutes ever
heard of "ladies first"?

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.192
Aw! You're adorable.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.953
Is this love?

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.112
I love love.

<i>Trying to catch

never touch</i>

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.471
<i>But now I won't let go</i>
