<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:03.039 --> 00:05.143
ANNOUNCER: First place,
"Wait for Me, Mom."
(whoops)

00:05.143 --> 00:07.883
SARI:
<i>They would not be this bothered</i>
<i>if they were not threatened.</i>

00:07.883 --> 00:10.688
KIRA: <i>I'm not letting a bunch</i>
<i>of mothers of seven‐year‐olds</i>

00:10.688 --> 00:11.857
degrade our children.

00:11.857 --> 00:12.993
We need to know where you stand.

00:12.993 --> 00:15.264
ABBY LEE:
Be careful what you wish for.

00:15.264 --> 00:18.270
Get out. Get out!

00:18.270 --> 00:19.606
You're a role model!

00:19.606 --> 00:20.642
For who?!

00:22.011 --> 00:24.282
Abby, this cannot go on stage.

00:24.282 --> 00:26.052
JESSALYNN: <i>Our kids are putting</i>
<i>a dance on stage</i>

00:26.052 --> 00:28.524
<i>that they self‐choreographed</i>
<i>in a hotel room.</i>

00:28.524 --> 00:29.860
ANNOUNCER:
And in first place,

00:29.860 --> 00:31.664
number 90, "Why Wait?"

ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:35.772 --> 00:37.509
KALANI: <i>Abby is still a little</i>
<i>mad that we choreographed</i>

00:37.509 --> 00:38.844
our own dance last week.

00:38.844 --> 00:39.980
They kind of proved that

00:39.980 --> 00:41.684
<i>they don't really need her.</i>

00:41.684 --> 00:44.488
And now comes the time
to mix it up a little bit.

00:44.488 --> 00:47.094
<i>I'm matching up a mini</i>
<i>with a junior.</i>

00:47.094 --> 00:50.167
<i>I need them to realize that</i>
<i>we're all on the same team.</i>

00:50.167 --> 00:52.171
The elite team moms
don't want us here.

00:52.171 --> 00:53.641
Get your money back
for that PhD.

00:53.641 --> 00:54.910
Okay.

00:56.079 --> 00:57.949
ABBY LEE:
Whoever the highest placing duet

00:57.949 --> 01:00.521
<i>will have a solo next week.</i>

01:00.521 --> 01:02.358
ASHLEE: <i>If JoJo beats Brynn,</i>
<i>it's gonna be</i>

01:02.358 --> 01:04.863
something I will never be
allowed to forget.

GIANNA:
<i>Step together.</i>

01:15.417 --> 01:17.856
Pick yourself up.

01:17.856 --> 01:19.860
What turn did you do last week

01:19.860 --> 01:21.162
so you don't do it
again this week?

01:23.668 --> 01:24.936
KALANI:
We have, like, skirts,

01:24.936 --> 01:26.907
so put your hands on your hips,
that might be cute.

01:28.844 --> 01:31.049
JILL: <i>I have no idea</i>
<i>how Abby's gonna react</i>

01:31.049 --> 01:32.619
over what happened last week.

01:32.619 --> 01:34.488
<i>Our girls stepped up</i>

01:34.488 --> 01:37.796
<i>and choreographed their own</i>
<i>routine, and we still won.</i>

01:37.796 --> 01:39.666
<i>Last week, Abby spent</i>

01:39.666 --> 01:41.402
all her time with the minis.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.541
This week, we need to make sure

01:43.541 --> 01:46.914
<i>that Abby pays attention</i>
<i>to our kids</i>

01:46.914 --> 01:49.586
and sees their desire to dance.

01:49.586 --> 01:51.489
<i>That's why</i>
<i>we're coming in early</i>

01:51.489 --> 01:54.161
<i>to get our dance started</i>
<i>before the minis.</i>

01:54.161 --> 01:56.533
<i>It shows the level</i>
<i>of commitment</i>

01:56.533 --> 01:58.103
that we want this.

01:58.103 --> 01:59.371
The kids want it.

01:59.371 --> 02:01.242
STACEY:
So, guys, feels like

02:01.242 --> 02:02.545
we've been coming in here
every day

02:02.545 --> 02:03.814
and it's like
we're going into battle.

02:05.350 --> 02:07.622
<i>We know the elite team moms</i>
<i>don't want us here,</i>

02:07.622 --> 02:10.160
so we've got thick skin.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.563
They've been saying we're
temporary since day one.

02:11.563 --> 02:12.665
We're obviously not
'cause we're back.

02:12.665 --> 02:14.335
I feel like the
girls' dancing,

02:14.335 --> 02:16.272
they're winning week after week.

02:16.272 --> 02:19.178
Over time, it's going to prove
their spots and why we're here.

02:20.648 --> 02:22.451
I know that Elliana's
dancing from her heart,

02:22.451 --> 02:24.589
and she was so excited to go
and do a new genre.

02:24.589 --> 02:26.492
That's what‐‐
she's happy about that.

02:26.492 --> 02:28.731
STACEY:
<i>Yolanda is getting</i>

02:28.731 --> 02:30.300
a little too confident
for my taste.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.570
I think she thinks her kid

02:31.570 --> 02:33.006
<i>is the new Maddie or something.</i>

02:33.006 --> 02:35.343
<i>First she gets</i>
<i>all high and mighty</i>

02:35.343 --> 02:37.147
just because somebody gave
her kid a compliment

02:37.147 --> 02:38.551
about her dancing.

02:38.551 --> 02:40.253
WOMAN:
Your little girl stole the show

02:40.253 --> 02:41.790
when she walked offstage.

02:41.790 --> 02:44.629
She put it out there.
She put it out there.

02:44.629 --> 02:46.332
STACEY: <i>And then, last week,</i>
<i>her daughter got the lead</i>

02:46.332 --> 02:47.702
<i>in the group dance,</i>

02:47.702 --> 02:49.539
so I think all this attention
is just going to her head.

02:49.539 --> 02:51.510
<i>But we're a team here.</i>

02:51.510 --> 02:52.779
<i>She needs to start</i>
<i>acting like it,</i>

02:52.779 --> 02:54.181
<i>not like she's above it all.</i>

02:55.685 --> 02:57.522
STACEY: What's your agenda
for being here?

02:57.522 --> 02:59.526
Like, really?
'Cause we see you doing, like,

02:59.526 --> 03:01.797
all this stuff on
the side not with us.

03:01.797 --> 03:04.068
We see you talking
to the teachers alone.

03:04.068 --> 03:05.905
Like, usually, if there's
something to talk about,

03:05.905 --> 03:07.942
we'll go in, we all
speak to the teacher.
All together.

03:07.942 --> 03:09.813
And then we walk away, and
then you're with your phone

03:09.813 --> 03:11.984
doing something private
with the teacher.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.754
YOLANDA:
'Cause I'm friendly to somebody?

03:13.754 --> 03:16.560
My actions are because
I'm friendly. I'm not snooty.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.831
I'm not quite sure
that you can say the same.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.705
JILL:
Hi, Miranda!

03:22.705 --> 03:24.743
Hi. How are you guys?
Good.

03:24.743 --> 03:26.312
Did you hear
about our weekend?

03:26.312 --> 03:28.149
Girls, tell 'em what happened.

03:28.149 --> 03:29.719
KENDALL:
So, on Friday,

03:29.719 --> 03:32.257
we decided to do
a whole new dance.

03:32.257 --> 03:36.299
And we found a song, and,
on Saturday, we finished it.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.269
Seven, eight.

03:38.269 --> 03:39.606
KALANI:
Okay, guys,

03:39.606 --> 03:40.841
a thing with this dance is,

03:40.841 --> 03:42.244
is when you think
you want to go,

03:42.244 --> 03:44.582
don't go, wait another second.
Wait another second.

03:44.582 --> 03:47.555
KENDALL: So, we decided,
guys, on the breath,

03:47.555 --> 03:49.224
we decided it's here, not here.

03:49.224 --> 03:51.262
Wait for it.

03:51.262 --> 03:52.431
What happened?

03:52.431 --> 03:53.433
We won!

03:54.869 --> 03:56.238
Wait, oh, my God.
HOLLY: Yeah.

03:56.238 --> 03:58.644
(laughs)
I'm so proud of you.

03:58.644 --> 04:00.113
JILL:
It was, like, they had

04:00.113 --> 04:01.783
this passion onstage
that we haven't seen

04:01.783 --> 04:03.152
in a while as a group.

04:03.152 --> 04:05.023
MIRANDA:
I'm so proud of you guys.

04:05.023 --> 04:06.425
When it's coming from,

04:06.425 --> 04:09.498
like, your heart and stuff,
it's‐it's awesome,

04:09.498 --> 04:11.670
but it's also very terrifying.
You know what I mean?

04:11.670 --> 04:13.473
And it's‐‐
you're so subject,

04:13.473 --> 04:14.609
I'm sure you guys know,
to, like...

04:14.609 --> 04:16.546
JILL: Could they keep it down
in there please?

04:16.546 --> 04:18.349
Oh, I'm very smart.
I'm very smart. I'm...

04:18.349 --> 04:21.288
JILL: <i>Here we are trying</i>
<i>to enjoy the conversation.</i>

04:21.288 --> 04:25.163
And all I hear,
through the cinder block walls,

04:25.163 --> 04:27.935
<i>is these mini moms</i>
<i>screaming at one another.</i>

04:27.935 --> 04:29.071
<i>Can't tell what they're saying,</i>

04:29.071 --> 04:30.808
but I know it's not good.

04:30.808 --> 04:32.377
Go tell them to shut up.

04:32.377 --> 04:33.514
Tell them to get out

04:33.514 --> 04:34.516
like you do best.

04:34.516 --> 04:35.918
"Get out!"
I really don't care.

04:35.918 --> 04:37.254
YOLANDA:
<i>Because I'm sitting there</i>

04:37.254 --> 04:38.824
and I'm being friendly
to people?

04:38.824 --> 04:40.828
I don't just go ahead
and get together

04:40.828 --> 04:42.965
with my little clique;
I talk to other people.

04:42.965 --> 04:45.103
And I don't need to get
permission from any of you.

04:45.103 --> 04:46.338
JESSALYNN:
<i>Wait, what are they saying?</i>

04:48.811 --> 04:51.048
Oh.
JILL:
All right, stay out of it.

04:51.048 --> 04:53.319
They're getting real intense
in there; it's kind of funny.

04:53.319 --> 04:55.423
JESSALYNN:
I told them in the beginning,
be friends with each other.

04:55.423 --> 04:56.425
Yes.

04:56.425 --> 04:58.496
Stick together,
have a strong team.

04:58.496 --> 04:59.799
HOLLY:
They're adults.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.968
They created that drama.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.304
We didn't even
create that drama.

05:02.304 --> 05:03.707
KIRA:
They created that

05:03.707 --> 05:05.578
within themself as adults.

05:05.578 --> 05:07.314
And then,

05:07.314 --> 05:09.619
even a step further,
they go and blame our children.

05:09.619 --> 05:10.855
JESSALYNN:
Yeah, for being mean.

05:10.855 --> 05:12.224
Yeah.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.094
They're just trying
to drag us into it.

05:14.094 --> 05:15.798
'Cause they just want
to fight with everyone.

05:15.798 --> 05:18.402
I think the behavior
of the mini team

05:18.402 --> 05:20.508
<i>last week was appalling.</i>

05:20.508 --> 05:24.883
<i>For the moms</i>
<i>to come after our kids</i>

05:24.883 --> 05:27.220
was disgraceful.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.724
My daughter's seven years old.

05:28.724 --> 05:30.594
She's been idolizing
these girls since

05:30.594 --> 05:31.963
she's probably two.

05:31.963 --> 05:34.334
And then she goes in
to wish them good luck,

05:34.334 --> 05:35.771
and the girls
are rude to her.

05:35.771 --> 05:37.942
That makes me sick to
my stomach; that's wrong.

05:37.942 --> 05:40.346
And the majority of the girls
are old enough to know better.

05:40.346 --> 05:41.883
HOLLY:
<i>They're just looking for drama.</i>

05:41.883 --> 05:43.119
And I don't get it.

05:44.889 --> 05:47.360
Come on, let's go! Pyramid!

05:47.360 --> 05:48.931
Oh, my gosh.

05:51.803 --> 05:52.905
ABBY LEE:
All right.

05:52.905 --> 05:55.176
Now, let's talk about
the competition.

05:55.176 --> 05:56.913
We had

05:56.913 --> 05:59.819
not only one big
winning group,

05:59.819 --> 06:02.023
but two big winning groups.

06:04.896 --> 06:07.100
Let's get to the pyramid.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.071
Abby, aren't you going to
acknowledge what these kids did?

06:09.071 --> 06:10.741
We arrived in Phoenix

06:10.741 --> 06:12.645
without a group number.

06:12.645 --> 06:14.549
I just want you
to acknowledge

06:14.549 --> 06:16.987
what your elite...
I give them 100% credit.

06:16.987 --> 06:18.456
...competition team did.
But I also

06:18.456 --> 06:20.393
give Gianna credit and...

06:20.393 --> 06:22.197
myself because
they're trained

06:22.197 --> 06:25.303
to the point
where they could put together

06:25.303 --> 06:26.472
two minutes quickly.

06:26.472 --> 06:27.508
KIRA:
But, Abby,

06:27.508 --> 06:28.844
when they went on stage and said

06:28.844 --> 06:32.050
that they took part
in the choreographing,

06:32.050 --> 06:34.054
you sat there and said, "Ooh,
I should've worked with them

06:34.054 --> 06:35.223
on what to say."

06:35.223 --> 06:36.458
Who was your
choreographer today?

06:36.458 --> 06:37.460
Uh...

06:38.597 --> 06:39.732
GIRLS:
Us!

06:39.732 --> 06:42.470
I thought it was a bit callous

06:42.470 --> 06:45.744
the way it was said, like,
"We did it at lunch."

06:45.744 --> 06:48.750
It's a testament to how good
your kids really, truly are.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.253
We are very proud of you.

06:50.253 --> 06:51.690
Don't think for one minute
that we're not proud of you.

06:51.690 --> 06:55.129
JILL: Fabulous.
That's all we ask for.

06:55.129 --> 06:56.966
ABBY LEE:
Okay.

06:56.966 --> 07:00.006
At the bottom of the pyramid...

07:00.006 --> 07:01.208
Brynn.

07:03.245 --> 07:04.414
And Kalani.

07:04.414 --> 07:07.621
Our hometown girls.

07:07.621 --> 07:09.157
<i>You kind of let me down.</i>

07:09.157 --> 07:10.293
<i>You were second.</i>

07:10.293 --> 07:12.832
<i>And second</i>
<i>is the first to lose.</i>

07:14.267 --> 07:16.038
Next we have...

07:16.038 --> 07:17.307
Kendall.

07:17.307 --> 07:19.612
We had another duet.

07:19.612 --> 07:21.081
<i>Our pop stars.</i>

07:21.081 --> 07:23.152
<i>Kendall, it was great.</i>

07:23.152 --> 07:25.123
And then... JoJo.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.862
<i>You didn't have a trio</i>
<i>or a duet</i>

07:27.862 --> 07:29.231
<i>or a solo</i>
<i>or anything this week.</i>

07:29.231 --> 07:30.701
<i>I thought you were outstanding</i>
<i>in the group dance.</i>

07:30.701 --> 07:34.174
ABBY LEE:
On top of the pyramid...

07:34.174 --> 07:35.143
is Nia.

07:35.143 --> 07:36.780
(girls cheering)

07:38.416 --> 07:41.155
ABBY LEE: We had a little
costume malfunction.

07:41.155 --> 07:44.461
<i>But you made</i>
<i>your movements work</i>

07:44.461 --> 07:46.966
<i>so that you could stay on stage</i>
<i>and finish the number.</i>

07:46.966 --> 07:49.471
Okay, let's move on
to the mini pyramid.

07:49.471 --> 07:51.041
At the bottom of
the mini pyramid...

07:53.513 --> 07:54.515
Peyton.

07:55.784 --> 07:57.621
<i>I just feel that you struggle</i>

07:57.621 --> 07:59.559
<i>to keep up with</i>
<i>the choreography.</i>

07:59.559 --> 08:00.994

08:02.030 --> 08:03.165
Alexus.

08:04.401 --> 08:08.175
<i>This group routine</i>
<i>was tough for you.</i>

08:08.175 --> 08:09.311

08:09.311 --> 08:11.215

dancers around you.

08:11.215 --> 08:12.718
All right?

08:12.718 --> 08:15.958
Okay, uh, next we have...

08:15.958 --> 08:17.060
Elliana.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.897
<i>You were given</i>

08:18.897 --> 08:20.266
<i>a featured part, you did it.</i>

<i>Every step in that routine</i>
<i>was easy for you.</i>

08:23.372 --> 08:25.309
And next we have Areana.

08:25.309 --> 08:26.713
You try to make things

08:26.713 --> 08:29.117
<i>your own, and then</i>
<i>you go out in a group</i>

08:29.117 --> 08:30.654
<i>and you make it better.</i>

08:30.654 --> 08:32.123
And at the top
of the pyramid...

08:32.123 --> 08:35.631
would have to be
our newest member.

08:35.631 --> 08:37.333
She did a lyrical routine.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.070
She nailed it.

08:39.070 --> 08:41.576

08:46.084 --> 08:49.859

08:49.859 --> 08:54.502
There's gonna be some tough
competition this weekend.

09:00.547 --> 09:02.050
"The End of the Road."

09:02.050 --> 09:05.256

of the road?

09:05.256 --> 09:07.026

for me?

09:07.026 --> 09:08.362

09:08.362 --> 09:10.534

09:10.534 --> 09:13.272
HOLLY:
<i>Can we be any more obvious?</i>

09:13.272 --> 09:14.775
I think Abby thinks we're done.

09:14.775 --> 09:16.011

09:16.011 --> 09:18.082
<i>our kids are washed up.</i>

09:18.082 --> 09:20.186
<i>She's had our team</i>
<i>for several years,</i>

09:20.186 --> 09:22.825

and she's bringing in

09:22.825 --> 09:25.196
<i>these new babes</i>
<i>and casting us out.</i>

09:25.196 --> 09:26.465
<i>Like, our kids are</i>
<i>just getting started,</i>

09:26.465 --> 09:28.135
<i>and now she's, like,</i>
<i>done with us.</i>

09:28.135 --> 09:30.072

the writing's on the wall.

09:30.072 --> 09:32.544
ABBY LEE: Minis, the
name of your routine‐‐

09:32.544 --> 09:34.381
now listen closely‐‐

09:34.381 --> 09:38.957
is "Mime... Your Business."

09:38.957 --> 09:43.667
Now, we also
have two duets.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.371
And now comes the time
to mix it up a little bit.

09:46.371 --> 09:49.612
I'm matching up a
mini with a junior.

09:49.612 --> 09:50.947
Yes! (whoops)
Yes!

09:53.018 --> 09:54.855
ABBY LEE: <i>The minis and</i>
<i>the elites have been fighting</i>

09:54.855 --> 09:56.491
<i>with each other since day one.</i>

09:56.491 --> 09:59.598
<i>I need them to realize that</i>
<i>we're all on the same team.</i>

09:59.598 --> 10:02.938
And I'm hoping these mixed duets
will do the trick.

10:02.938 --> 10:04.040
Brynn.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.779
You are performing
a duet based on

10:06.779 --> 10:08.583

10:08.583 --> 10:10.419
<i>The Bad Seed.</i>

10:10.419 --> 10:11.589
Hmm.

10:11.589 --> 10:15.764
Our version is entitled
"The Bad Deed."

10:15.764 --> 10:19.471
You are going
to perform...

10:19.471 --> 10:20.507

10:20.507 --> 10:21.976

Wow.

Come on out here, Lilli.

10:25.349 --> 10:27.721
Stand next to Brynn.

10:27.721 --> 10:28.990
That is, like,
her dream come true.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.694
We're here to make
your dreams...

10:30.694 --> 10:32.263

10:32.263 --> 10:33.332
I feel the same way.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.438

I would have chosen for her.

10:43.085 --> 10:44.722
<i>Brynn needs something</i>
<i>with some intensity,</i>

10:44.722 --> 10:46.057
<i>with some challenge to it.</i>

10:46.057 --> 10:47.628
Like, why are we spending

10:47.628 --> 10:49.130
a whole nother week
doing something

10:49.130 --> 10:50.634

10:52.303 --> 10:53.372
JoJo, you also have a duet.

10:53.372 --> 10:57.480
The name of the piece is
"Fan Favorite."

10:57.480 --> 11:01.087
You are an over‐the‐top,
obsessed fan.

11:01.087 --> 11:03.392

11:03.392 --> 11:04.695
Elliana will be portraying

11:04.695 --> 11:06.566
the starlet.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.903
JESSALYNN:
<i>I am super annoyed with this.</i>

11:08.903 --> 11:11.408
<i>JoJo should not be dancing</i>
<i>with a mini.</i>

11:11.408 --> 11:12.744
<i>However,</i>

11:12.744 --> 11:14.682
JoJo is going against Brynn,

11:14.682 --> 11:17.721

JoJo can

11:19.658 --> 11:21.194
<i>outperform Brynn,</i>

11:21.194 --> 11:24.400

11:32.818 --> 11:34.287
Yeah.
They're...

Right.

11:39.464 --> 11:40.834
<i>And without talking.</i>

<i>Their facial expressions.</i>

11:42.871 --> 11:45.944

11:48.850 --> 11:52.089
And now, from here,
open your legs to straddle

11:52.089 --> 11:55.129
and push through and fall
right through with your hands.

11:55.129 --> 11:57.500
Push through.
Don't sickle your feet.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.538

16:40.031 --> 16:41.869
<i>So, for me, I want Elliana</i>
<i>to stand out.</i>

16:41.869 --> 16:43.271
JESSALYNN:
<i>I think it's gonna be good.</i>

16:43.271 --> 16:44.975
I think the crowd
is gonna love it.

16:44.975 --> 16:45.977
(laughs)

16:45.977 --> 16:47.012
The dance is called
"Fan Favorite."

16:47.012 --> 16:48.281
YOLANDA:
<i>"Fan Favorite."</i>

16:48.281 --> 16:49.851
<i>It's got that</i>
<i>entertainment factor.</i>

16:49.851 --> 16:50.987
STACEY: <i>Well, I hope</i>
<i>we're the judges' favorite.</i>

16:50.987 --> 16:53.491
(Ashlee laughs)

16:53.491 --> 16:54.861
That will be determined.

16:54.861 --> 16:56.598
YOLANDA:
Well, the entertainment factor

16:56.598 --> 16:58.234
can be the judges' favorite.

16:58.234 --> 17:01.240
ASHLEE: <i>I think</i>
<i>this whole Paul‐la thing,</i>

17:01.240 --> 17:04.280
<i>even though it's funny,</i>
<i>it's so stupid.</i>

17:04.280 --> 17:06.217
It is honestly obnoxious.
(chuckles)

17:06.217 --> 17:07.954
ABBY LEE:
<i>Okay.</i>

17:07.954 --> 17:09.256
I have to dismiss
you girls.

17:09.256 --> 17:11.193
Thank you, honey,
for coming.

17:11.193 --> 17:12.931
<i>Um, I hope you have</i>
<i>a ride home now,</i>

17:12.931 --> 17:14.734
<i>because we can't be fooling</i>
<i>around and we don't let fans</i>

17:14.734 --> 17:16.772
in the studio.
JOJO: My uncle's
coming to pick me up.

17:16.772 --> 17:18.408
Okay, good.
Thank you.

17:18.408 --> 17:20.078
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Abby.

17:20.078 --> 17:22.850
ABBY LEE: <i>We have T‐shirts</i>
<i>for sale next door.</i>

17:22.850 --> 17:24.588
If you want to get one,
I'll sign it. Okay.

17:24.588 --> 17:26.357
JOJO: Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much, Miss Abby.

17:26.357 --> 17:27.760
ELLIANA:
Thank you!

17:27.760 --> 17:28.929
ABBY LEE:
<i>Brynn, Lilli,</i>

17:28.929 --> 17:30.098
let's go!

17:30.098 --> 17:32.604
We got to go quick.
We got to get it done.

17:32.604 --> 17:34.006
<i>So this kid,</i>
<i>who's seven years old,</i>

17:34.006 --> 17:35.175
<i>can get it in her brain.</i>

17:35.175 --> 17:39.416
You are doing
"Bad Deed."

17:39.416 --> 17:43.458
<i>So, a deed is like a job</i>
<i>or something you did‐‐ a task.</i>

17:43.458 --> 17:44.460
<i>So, everybody thinks</i>

17:44.460 --> 17:45.696
you're this sweet
little girl,

17:45.696 --> 17:48.602
but really, you're
this holy terror brat.

17:48.602 --> 17:50.038
And you know it.

17:50.038 --> 17:51.742
<i>And you see it</i>
<i>and she torments you,</i>

17:51.742 --> 17:54.380
(singsongy):
going, "Nah‐nah‐nah‐nah."

17:54.380 --> 17:55.382
Hide.

17:55.382 --> 17:57.085
<i>Let's just try that.</i>

17:57.085 --> 17:59.924
ABBY LEE (singsongy):
Nah‐nah‐nah‐nah.

17:59.924 --> 18:01.695
Hide.

18:01.695 --> 18:03.966
<i>This week, Brynn and Lilli have</i>

18:03.966 --> 18:06.638
a duet inspired by the movie
<i>The Bad Seed.</i>

18:06.638 --> 18:08.976
<i>It's about</i>
<i>an adorable little girl</i>

18:08.976 --> 18:12.082
<i>who isn't so adorable.</i>

18:12.082 --> 18:14.286
<i>Not like she first seems.</i>

18:14.286 --> 18:16.992
It's gonna be a challenge
for both of these dancers

18:16.992 --> 18:18.629
<i>to play dark characters.</i>

18:18.629 --> 18:21.033
<i>Brynn always has trouble</i>
<i>with dark characters.</i>

18:21.033 --> 18:22.302
<i>And Lilli,</i>

18:22.302 --> 18:24.541
she's only seven;
she's always smiling.

18:24.541 --> 18:26.243
ASHLEE: <i>Has Lilli ever</i>
<i>done a dark dance?</i>

18:26.243 --> 18:27.446
STACEY:
<i>Yes.</i>

18:27.446 --> 18:29.751
Just want to make sure
she knows the choreo,

18:29.751 --> 18:31.621
so that she could
let herself go.

18:31.621 --> 18:33.659
ABBY LEE: One arm under,
one arm over.

18:36.665 --> 18:38.067
You're never gonna
fall over,

18:38.067 --> 18:39.938
'cause your head would
have to snap off your body.

18:39.938 --> 18:41.775
<i>So, just go for it.</i>

18:44.614 --> 18:46.050
Can you step up on her?

18:46.050 --> 18:48.187
Bump‐ba‐da‐bump.

18:48.187 --> 18:49.791
Bump.

18:49.791 --> 18:51.293
STACEY:
<i>Lilli and Brynn are</i>

18:51.293 --> 18:55.435
both the newest people
on their respective teams.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.472
<i>So, I feel like</i>
<i>they're the underdogs.</i>

18:57.472 --> 18:58.642
<i>Then we have, you know,</i>

18:58.642 --> 19:00.880
<i>Jessalynn,</i>
<i>who is the instigator.</i>

19:00.880 --> 19:04.253
<i>She's always got</i>
<i>something to say.</i>

19:04.253 --> 19:05.856
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>what her issue is,</i>

19:05.856 --> 19:07.425
<i>but she definitely seems like</i>

19:07.425 --> 19:11.601
<i>the person who's the most</i>
<i>unhappy that we even exist.</i>

19:11.601 --> 19:13.605
ABBY LEE: <i>Stand up pretty</i>
<i>and take her there.</i>

19:13.605 --> 19:14.874
And she's
fighting you.

19:14.874 --> 19:17.345
Walk pretty.
Développé walks.

19:17.345 --> 19:20.351
JESSALYNN:
<i>Are you worried that Brynn's</i>
<i>gonna make Lilli look bad?</i>

19:20.351 --> 19:21.721
STACEY:
Am I worried that Brynn

19:21.721 --> 19:23.625
is gonna make
Lilli look bad? No.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.596
How many years older
is Brynn? Five?

19:25.596 --> 19:27.032
STACEY:
<i>It's gonna be tough to keep up</i>

19:27.032 --> 19:29.069
<i>with the technique of Brynn,</i>
<i>so, I mean...</i>

19:29.069 --> 19:31.842
JESSALYNN: <i>She's not gonna keep</i>
<i>up with Brynn's technique.</i>

19:31.842 --> 19:34.848
ASHLEE: Brynn has had
six more years of training.

19:34.848 --> 19:37.352
<i>Like, it's‐‐ that's not</i>
<i>the goal of the duet.</i>

19:37.352 --> 19:40.291
The duet, really, honestly, they
just need to remember it and do

19:40.291 --> 19:42.763
the best they can.

19:42.763 --> 19:44.166
<i>Brynn's a pretty ballerina.</i>

19:44.166 --> 19:46.771
She has to act a little bit,
like, act mad at Lilli.

19:46.771 --> 19:49.510
<i>It's not challenging for Brynn.</i>

19:49.510 --> 19:52.482
<i>And Abby even admitted that</i>
<i>it was watered down for Lilli.</i>

19:52.482 --> 19:54.119
<i>So, it's not fair to Brynn.</i>

19:54.119 --> 19:55.890
<i>But the worst thing is</i>

19:55.890 --> 19:58.729
if JoJo beats Brynn,
it's gonna be

19:58.729 --> 20:00.498
something I will
never be allowed to forget.

20:00.498 --> 20:02.235
ABBY LEE:
<i>All right, girls.</i>

20:02.235 --> 20:04.373
<i>It's time for us</i>
<i>to get to the big kids.</i>

20:06.076 --> 20:07.445
(laughs)

20:07.445 --> 20:09.116
I don't know.
I kind of liked Paul‐la.

20:09.116 --> 20:11.053
I didn't have to deal with
Paul‐la's mother.

20:13.324 --> 20:15.228
GIANNA:
We can do da...

20:15.228 --> 20:17.165
down‐down‐cross and grand‐jeté
or something.

20:20.004 --> 20:21.006
And then the pitch?

20:21.006 --> 20:23.177
It doesn't feel so, like...

20:23.177 --> 20:25.181
KALANI: <i>I think Abby</i>
<i>is still a little mad</i>

20:25.181 --> 20:27.018
<i>that we choreographed</i>
<i>our own dance last week,</i>

20:27.018 --> 20:29.456
<i>considering that she just</i>
<i>walked out of rehearsal.</i>

20:29.456 --> 20:32.362
But, to be honest, I'm really
not that upset because

20:32.362 --> 20:34.901
<i>I like having</i>
<i>all this responsibility.</i>

20:34.901 --> 20:36.571
<i>And now, we can do</i>

20:36.571 --> 20:37.840
our own thing and kind of

20:37.840 --> 20:39.677
help choreograph the dance
with Gianna.

20:39.677 --> 20:42.415
You do... that.
And then what do you do?

20:42.415 --> 20:46.323
Then we go five,
six, seven...

20:46.323 --> 20:48.595
HOLLY: <i>It's interesting</i>
<i>that Abby has made</i>

20:48.595 --> 20:51.166
her choice about
where she will spend her time.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.202
ASHLEE:
<i>Mm‐hmm.</i>

20:52.202 --> 20:53.437
<i>I think it's interesting that</i>

20:53.437 --> 20:55.441
<i>our dance was "End of the Road"</i>
<i>this week,</i>

20:55.441 --> 20:56.811
because, last week,

20:56.811 --> 20:59.550
they kind of proved that
they don't really need her.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.422
<i>Maybe it is</i>
<i>the end of the road for...</i>

21:02.422 --> 21:05.929
Abby always having to have
her hand in what they're doing.

21:05.929 --> 21:08.034
♪ ♪

21:08.034 --> 21:09.670
GIANNA:
<i>Nice, guys.</i>

21:09.670 --> 21:11.608
JoJo that was good.

21:11.608 --> 21:14.947
♪ Long to lose my shoes
and ease my mind ♪

21:14.947 --> 21:17.118
♪ At home... ♪

21:17.118 --> 21:18.254
If it's perfect,

21:18.254 --> 21:20.024
we can be done early.
(girls cheering)

21:20.024 --> 21:21.795
They're funny.

21:21.795 --> 21:23.565
Uh‐huh. They're happy.
They are.

21:23.565 --> 21:25.869
JESSALYNN:
<i>It's fun to see them so happy.</i>

21:27.973 --> 21:29.342
Are you guys done?

21:29.342 --> 21:30.411
Yeah, the group's finished.

21:30.411 --> 21:31.815
HOLLY: Oh, that's great.
JESSALYNN: Good!

21:31.815 --> 21:33.184
JILL:
Do you like this number?

21:33.184 --> 21:34.520
JESSALYNN:
Do you? Good, good.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.423
Looks beautiful.
It's‐‐ yeah, it's really good.

21:36.423 --> 21:38.995
You guys think G is, like,
more free to do, like,

21:38.995 --> 21:40.566
more advanced choreography
and stuff,

21:40.566 --> 21:42.536
when Abby's not in there
so much sometimes?

21:42.536 --> 21:45.441
No, I just think that
whenever it's Gia and us,

21:45.441 --> 21:47.613
like, we all bounce off ideas,

21:47.613 --> 21:49.617
and it just, like,
it flows more, you know?

21:49.617 --> 21:50.886
JILL:
That's good.

21:50.886 --> 21:52.255
KALANI: No, yeah, it's‐it's
good.

21:52.255 --> 21:53.558
It's nice.

21:53.558 --> 21:55.161
It makes things go by quicker,
but I feel like

21:55.161 --> 21:56.531
whenever Abby's in there,
she's like,

21:56.531 --> 21:58.167
"No, it needs to be
in jazz slide,"

21:58.167 --> 22:00.404
and, "Arms like this."

22:00.404 --> 22:02.710
But the fact that
you're growing up,

22:02.710 --> 22:04.680
you're able to contribute
to your own dances,

22:04.680 --> 22:06.951
and I think that's part
of the passion that we see.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.454
It's so nice.
It's so nice.

22:08.454 --> 22:09.690
Once you get older,

22:09.690 --> 22:11.761
you feel like you can have
more of a say in it,

22:11.761 --> 22:13.230
because it's like,
when you're little, you're like,

22:13.230 --> 22:14.867
"Oh, they want me to go
like this. Okay."

22:14.867 --> 22:16.804
But, like, now it's like,
"I'm not very good at that.

22:16.804 --> 22:19.276
Can we change it?"

22:19.276 --> 22:20.546
Although our girls
are getting older,

22:20.546 --> 22:22.583
and I love the fact
that they have and they want

22:22.583 --> 22:23.785
a more creative voice,

22:23.785 --> 22:25.221
<i>it doesn't make up for the fact</i>

22:25.221 --> 22:28.562
<i>that Abby clearly only wants</i>
<i>to work with the minis.</i>

22:28.562 --> 22:30.298
I know Abby wants us
all to get along,

22:30.298 --> 22:32.402
but, last week,
things got kind of volatile.

22:32.402 --> 22:33.939
KIRA: You can walk right
back the other way.

22:33.939 --> 22:35.107
No, no, no, no, no. I just...

22:35.107 --> 22:36.911
Nobody wants to see
any of you right now.

22:36.911 --> 22:39.316
You guys are belittling
our children,

22:39.316 --> 22:41.086
you are‐‐ you're all
disgusting parents.

22:41.086 --> 22:42.422
STACEY:
I'm sorry, you wouldn't know

22:42.422 --> 22:43.892
because you walked away
within, like, 30 seconds.

22:43.892 --> 22:45.361
You know what?

22:45.361 --> 22:48.267
You are a doctor; you're
ruining your practice right now.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.670
Get a brain!

22:49.670 --> 22:51.273
HOLLY: <i>And we're not okay</i>
<i>with the mini moms</i>

22:51.273 --> 22:52.275
<i>slandering our children.</i>

22:52.275 --> 22:54.246
It's just not okay.

22:54.246 --> 22:56.517
Thinking about
last week,

22:56.517 --> 22:58.688
we were talking about
your girls were offended

22:58.688 --> 23:00.024
because our girls
didn't say "thank you"

23:00.024 --> 23:01.193
when they said
"good luck."

23:01.193 --> 23:03.364
Rather than just jumping
to the conclusion

23:03.364 --> 23:04.900
that our girls are rude,

23:04.900 --> 23:06.270
let's get to the bottom
of what really happened,

23:06.270 --> 23:07.305
rather than just saying

23:07.305 --> 23:08.942
our kids are rude.

23:08.942 --> 23:11.213
Because nobody could get
the words out right,

23:11.213 --> 23:13.518
and all you guys heard was
"My daughter was rude,"

23:13.518 --> 23:15.354
I don't even remember
who said it,

23:15.354 --> 23:16.724
it didn't come out right,

23:16.724 --> 23:19.764
so then, you know,
everything just blew up.

23:19.764 --> 23:21.668
Stupid. Like, you guys
get bogged down

23:21.668 --> 23:22.670
with, like, petty (bleep).

23:22.670 --> 23:24.573
So you get pushed?

23:24.573 --> 23:26.076
Kindly leave.

23:26.076 --> 23:27.546
Really, we've had it with you.

23:27.546 --> 23:28.548
Let them have it!

23:28.548 --> 23:29.817
You're right.
They can have it.

23:29.817 --> 23:31.688
Don't you push somebody!

23:31.688 --> 23:33.190
KIRA:
Then get out of my way.

23:33.190 --> 23:35.127
I didn't push you,
I moved you out of the way

23:35.127 --> 23:37.800
because you wouldn't move when
I asked you to move three times.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.202
So I walked through you.

23:39.202 --> 23:41.206
So you're saying you could not
have walked around us?

23:41.206 --> 23:43.477
KIRA: You were all in a line
in front of the door.

23:43.477 --> 23:44.847
JILL:
Wait a minute.

23:44.847 --> 23:46.350
You're saying you couldn't
have stepped aside

23:46.350 --> 23:47.519
and let her walk out?

23:47.519 --> 23:48.655
TIFFANIE:
I didn't have time.

23:48.655 --> 23:50.291
She was a caged lion
just roaring.

23:50.291 --> 23:52.495
Oh, my God.
Mm‐hmm. Right.

23:52.495 --> 23:53.631
Why was Kira so mad?

23:53.631 --> 23:55.034
It's not‐‐ it's irrelevant.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.103

32:12.829 --> 32:14.064
All right.

32:14.064 --> 32:15.768
So, shall we?

32:19.542 --> 32:21.178
ABBY LEE:
The doors are all locked.

32:21.178 --> 32:22.347
I'm not walking
all the way around.

32:22.347 --> 32:24.619
Girls, go with Miss Gianna.

32:24.619 --> 32:25.855
You're gonna walk
around the building

32:25.855 --> 32:27.124
and go in the front door.

32:27.124 --> 32:28.827
Go ahead.

32:28.827 --> 32:30.965
Go check out the stage,
please, girls.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.804
All right, so do we knock?

32:33.804 --> 32:35.273
I guess that's what you do.

32:35.273 --> 32:37.277
HOLLY: I feel like we're
at the Emerald City.

32:37.277 --> 32:39.749
Oh, I know. What if they, like,
pull the little door open?

32:39.749 --> 32:41.920
"Go home!"
(laughter)

32:41.920 --> 32:43.156
Oh, they're
letting us in.

32:43.156 --> 32:44.491
Thank you.
Hi.

32:44.491 --> 32:46.162
ABBY LEE:
Thank you.

32:46.162 --> 32:48.065
HOLLY: We thought we had
the end of the road.

32:48.065 --> 32:49.803
No, the road continues.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.773
ASHLEE: Will we be in two rooms?
Do we know?

32:51.773 --> 32:53.142
ABBY LEE:
Let's go check it out.

32:53.142 --> 32:54.746
JILL: Why don't you
pick where you want...

32:54.746 --> 32:55.981
I am.

32:55.981 --> 32:57.652
<i>The dressing rooms</i>
<i>are not large enough</i>

32:57.652 --> 32:58.687
for all of us to be together.

32:58.687 --> 33:00.558
<i>So I'm going to split them up.</i>

33:00.558 --> 33:01.626
The duets are up first.

33:01.626 --> 33:02.995
<i>That should be</i>
<i>one dressing room.</i>

33:02.995 --> 33:04.666
Everybody else should be
in the other dressing room.

33:04.666 --> 33:07.772
Uh, we've never been separated
from our team.

33:07.772 --> 33:08.874
I know.

33:08.874 --> 33:10.276
BOTH:
I don't like this.

33:10.276 --> 33:12.180
I'd rather go with them.

33:12.180 --> 33:14.384
ABBY LEE: <i>Now, after the duets,</i>
<i>we can switch,</i>

33:14.384 --> 33:15.855
and all the minis
can be together

33:15.855 --> 33:17.525
and all the juniors
can be together, that's fine.

33:17.525 --> 33:20.463
Oh, it's the same exact room.

33:20.463 --> 33:21.800
<i>It's a dressing room.</i>

33:21.800 --> 33:23.269
<i>Just go in the room,</i>

33:23.269 --> 33:27.277
"mime" your business and do
what you're supposed to do.

33:27.277 --> 33:28.947
HOLLY:
This is the group that

33:28.947 --> 33:30.651
she doesn't care about.

33:30.651 --> 33:31.786
This is boring.

33:34.191 --> 33:35.628
ASHLEE:
I don't know if I like

33:35.628 --> 33:37.698
the whole idea of whoever wins
gets solos, 'cause I...

33:37.698 --> 33:39.067
JESSALYNN:
Why?

33:39.067 --> 33:40.436
Why? I think
it's nice.
I don't know.

33:40.436 --> 33:41.606
I just, I hate...
I don't know.

33:41.606 --> 33:44.011
JESSALYNN: The thing is,
is she already knows

33:44.011 --> 33:45.013
who she thinks

33:45.013 --> 33:46.348
is gonna win,

33:46.348 --> 33:48.319
and she wants them
to have solos next week.

33:48.319 --> 33:49.321
Abby...
Probably true.

33:49.321 --> 33:50.691
Who do you think
that is, then?

33:50.691 --> 33:53.129
Um, I don't know.
Ask her.

33:53.129 --> 33:54.532
We're good? Okay.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.302
So we're gonna get
the girls ready,

33:56.302 --> 33:58.674
stretch 'em out, do the
dance as best we can.

33:58.674 --> 34:00.811
JESSALYNN:
Hey, lovers!

34:00.811 --> 34:02.047
How you doing, girls?

34:02.047 --> 34:03.850
Good.
Good.

34:03.850 --> 34:05.654
So, um,

34:05.654 --> 34:08.860
Lilliana, what did you think
of dancing with the big kids?

34:08.860 --> 34:10.598
I think I was happy,

34:10.598 --> 34:14.371
and I'm kind of sad
because if we don't win,

34:14.371 --> 34:16.408
I'm the one who would
make us not win.

34:16.408 --> 34:19.247
Mm...

34:20.283 --> 34:22.220
So, if you lose today,

34:22.220 --> 34:23.890
it's your fault, not Brynn's?

34:24.959 --> 34:26.462
That's sad.

34:28.299 --> 34:30.604
HOLLY:
I think the duets,

34:30.604 --> 34:32.173
both duets,
are banking on that solo.

34:32.173 --> 34:35.380
I think the moms from your team,
the moms from our...

34:35.380 --> 34:37.117
are all gunning
for that solo.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.622
KIRA:
And nothing against the minis,

34:39.622 --> 34:41.793
but why should they be
the ones getting the solo

34:41.793 --> 34:43.530
when there has not been
a solo given out

34:43.530 --> 34:44.766
this season yet?

34:44.766 --> 34:46.836
It should clearly go
to one of the junior kids.

34:46.836 --> 34:47.938
Our kids have been here

34:47.938 --> 34:49.408
forever.

34:49.408 --> 34:51.111
It's not right.

34:51.111 --> 34:52.915
TIFFANIE: I mean, I could see
a junior and a mini getting it,

34:52.915 --> 34:54.084
but why this week?
Why these two?

34:54.084 --> 34:56.088
'Cause they're
the greenest here.

34:56.088 --> 34:58.492
I mean, the one's only been here
for a couple weeks,

34:58.492 --> 35:00.430
so I don't think
that she deserves a solo.

35:00.430 --> 35:03.235
And the other one,
she's only been here for, like,

35:03.235 --> 35:04.539
five weeks?

35:04.539 --> 35:06.175
HOLLY: Yeah, she just
kind of leapfrogged over...

35:06.175 --> 35:08.179
Everybody.
Yeah, pretty much
everyone on the team.

35:08.179 --> 35:09.582
KERRI: Peyton and
Alexus have never had

35:09.582 --> 35:11.151
solos at all since
we've been here.
No.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.287
It doesn't make sense.

35:12.287 --> 35:13.924
It's almost turning into a joke.

35:13.924 --> 35:15.961
ABBY LEE: Okay, I have
a surprise for you, sweetheart.

35:15.961 --> 35:17.397

35:17.397 --> 35:20.637

35:48.325 --> 35:50.229
All right. Girls, listen.

35:50.229 --> 35:53.068
We have two duets
going out on that stage,

35:53.068 --> 35:54.972
and there's some
really good dancers here.

35:54.972 --> 35:57.443
When you get
on that stage,

35:57.443 --> 35:59.381
it is all business. Got it?

35:59.381 --> 36:03.557
We need our
"Fan Favorite" to be

36:03.557 --> 36:07.096
crazy, to be fan‐tastic.

36:07.096 --> 36:08.733
That's what I want to see.

36:08.733 --> 36:10.537
Elliana, we are

36:10.537 --> 36:13.042
expecting you to
look like a star.

36:13.042 --> 36:15.948
So you have to be on point.

36:15.948 --> 36:18.987
Last week, you did
a lyrical routine.

36:18.987 --> 36:20.858
And your timing wasn't perfect.

36:20.858 --> 36:23.830
You know, after eight,
you can't rely on cute.

36:23.830 --> 36:25.299
You have to rely on good.

36:25.299 --> 36:26.301
Now, you two.

36:26.301 --> 36:28.974
We have "The Bad Deed."

36:28.974 --> 36:32.982
I want to see you own the
stage, be the brat. Got it?

36:32.982 --> 36:34.317
Yes. All right.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.421
Brynn, you understand
what has to happen out there.

36:36.421 --> 36:38.593
You have to be perfect.

36:38.593 --> 36:40.731
There's no ands, ifs or but.

36:40.731 --> 36:42.768
If that développé happens
and your knee is not straight,

36:42.768 --> 36:44.972
we can see it.

36:44.972 --> 36:46.876
And if we can see it,
we just wonder why you can't

JESSALYNN: Well, going from
dancing with Maddie and Kalani

37:27.558 --> 37:30.797
and Kendall to dancing
with a mini is...

37:30.797 --> 37:32.300
She's doing basics that are

37:32.300 --> 37:35.206
fundamental to her
continuing education.

37:35.206 --> 37:39.147
She relies on the extension,
she relies on the flexibility,

37:39.147 --> 37:40.316
she relies on her body

37:40.316 --> 37:43.055
<i>to dance, rather than</i>

42:45.827 --> 42:48.198
a little bit, but, to be honest,

42:48.198 --> 42:49.433
<i>Elliana's technique</i>
<i>was perfect.</i>

42:49.433 --> 42:51.170
<i>And if anything, she's the one</i>

42:51.170 --> 42:52.139
who made that duet good.

42:52.139 --> 42:54.243
<i>So, really,</i>

42:54.243 --> 42:56.314
<i>that dance was dumbed down</i>
<i>for JoJo and not</i>

42:56.314 --> 42:57.282
the seven‐year‐old.

42:57.282 --> 42:58.385
(laughter)

42:58.385 --> 42:59.588
That's, like,
the best dance ever.

42:59.588 --> 43:00.923
You don't even have to,
like, look good.

43:00.923 --> 43:03.529
You just have to be
really excited to be on stage.

43:03.529 --> 43:05.533
She didn't have to straighten
her knees and point her feet.

43:05.533 --> 43:07.771
Oh, they were straight.
Her feet were pointed.

43:12.981 --> 43:15.352
JILL:
She did not just say that.

43:15.352 --> 43:17.757
I don't understand what
Ashlee's thinking right now.

43:17.757 --> 43:21.330
<i>JoJo can outdance Brynn.</i>

43:21.330 --> 43:23.334

I would <i>be careful.</i>

43:28.646 --> 43:30.482
STACEY: <i>So, does anyone know</i>
<i>exactly how to do</i>

43:30.482 --> 43:33.488
the mime makeup, or do you think
we should ask for help?

43:33.488 --> 43:34.925
I think we should ask.
I'm not sure.

43:34.925 --> 43:36.260
YOLANDA: You would ask.
I failed miserably

43:36.260 --> 43:37.329
this morning
with barrettes, so...

43:37.329 --> 43:38.666
STACEY: All right,
Lilli, you want to

43:38.666 --> 43:40.102
come with me and ask?

43:40.102 --> 43:41.538
Come on.

43:45.847 --> 43:46.849
Hi, Abby.

43:46.849 --> 43:48.451
Hi, sweetie.

43:48.451 --> 43:49.621
We just had a question.

43:49.621 --> 43:50.923
You want a mini
corn dog for a mini?

43:50.923 --> 43:52.259
Did you ever have a corn dog?

43:52.259 --> 43:54.564
I don't think
she ever had a corn dog

43:54.564 --> 43:56.167
in her whole life.
You haven't lived.

43:56.167 --> 43:58.037
Here.
Try it.

43:58.037 --> 43:59.340
Take a bite.

43:59.340 --> 44:01.344
Hot dog inside.

44:01.344 --> 44:02.747
Mmm.
It's good,
isn't it?

44:02.747 --> 44:03.749
Wow. That‐‐
she doesn't...

44:03.749 --> 44:04.985
Fine dining.
She doesn't like much.

44:04.985 --> 44:06.220
(laughs)

44:06.220 --> 44:08.224
What's your question?
Now that your mouth is full.

44:10.863 --> 44:11.932
The mime makeup?

44:11.932 --> 44:13.334
STACEY: How would you like it?
Um...

44:13.334 --> 44:16.742
I want to draw a
line, like, here,

44:16.742 --> 44:18.278
so that there's no‐‐

44:18.278 --> 44:19.815
like, it's not going
into their hair

44:19.815 --> 44:21.985
with the white, and then...
We were wondering if

44:21.985 --> 44:23.689
maybe the, um,
the junior girls,

44:23.689 --> 44:24.991
if they could help?
Sure.

44:24.991 --> 44:26.027
What do you think?

44:26.027 --> 44:27.262
Let the girls know that.

44:27.262 --> 44:29.500
That‐that they need‐‐ it dries.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.839
So, they need to do it now
and then warm up

44:31.839 --> 44:33.074
and run their dance with Gianna.

44:33.074 --> 44:35.078
Oh, so the juniors
do the white first?

44:35.078 --> 44:37.149
And then run their dance
and then‐‐ okay.
Yeah, okay.

44:37.149 --> 44:38.619
All right,
I'll let them know.

44:38.619 --> 44:40.188
Some of those mini moms,

44:40.188 --> 44:43.829
<i>their makeup is scary,</i>
<i>and I do not want them</i>

44:43.829 --> 44:46.702
to ruin my routine
with their bad makeup.

44:49.608 --> 44:52.246
Hi. How are you?
Hey, guys.

44:52.246 --> 44:54.885
I went and talked to Abby,
and she said that you guys

44:54.885 --> 44:56.822
know how to use
this kind of paint.

44:56.822 --> 44:59.628
She wants white
circle on their face,

44:59.628 --> 45:01.698
and she said that you‐‐
the girls

45:01.698 --> 45:04.971
stop what they're doing,
do the circle, the white,

45:04.971 --> 45:06.775
and then get ready, and then
come back to do the triangles.

45:06.775 --> 45:08.879
That's what she said.
JESSALYNN: But we put in
our mini time this week.

45:08.879 --> 45:10.816
Uh, their mommies
can do their makeup.

45:10.816 --> 45:13.221
HOLLY: We have a half
an hour before we walk.

45:13.221 --> 45:14.223
I'm just relaying the message.

45:14.223 --> 45:15.660
JESSALYNN:
I'm telling you,

45:15.660 --> 45:18.799
get started, because
this is gonna happen first.

45:18.799 --> 45:20.670
You can go tell Abby.
I'll tell Abby

45:20.670 --> 45:21.972
we're not doing the makeup.

45:21.972 --> 45:23.341
That's fine.
But I'm telling you,

45:23.341 --> 45:25.846
if you want your kid to have
makeup on, go put it on.

45:30.155 --> 45:31.692
Bye!
Good luck.

45:31.692 --> 45:32.794
HOLLY:
Good luck.

45:32.794 --> 45:34.631
JESSALYNN:
It's not our job to get

45:34.631 --> 45:35.866
the minis ready.

45:35.866 --> 45:37.369
The minis' moms
should have

45:37.369 --> 45:39.941
Googled "mime makeup,"
talked to Abby

45:39.941 --> 45:41.210
and done it, right?

45:41.210 --> 45:43.147
HOLLY: Could you imagine
what she would say

45:43.147 --> 45:44.416
if we mess up their mime makeup?

45:44.416 --> 45:46.487
KIRA: Oh, God. We would be
sabotaging the dance.

45:46.487 --> 45:48.759
Yeah, exactly.
I don't want to be respon‐‐

45:48.759 --> 45:51.531
I want to "mime" my business.

45:51.531 --> 45:54.671
STACEY: <i>Who knows if the moms</i>
<i>are really too busy</i>

45:54.671 --> 45:57.643
to help the minis, or if they
don't want to help the minis.

45:57.643 --> 45:59.146
<i>So...</i>

45:59.146 --> 46:00.516
best case scenario,
they're busy.

46:00.516 --> 46:01.785
<i>Worst case scenario,</i>

46:01.785 --> 46:03.154
they're sabotaging us.

46:03.154 --> 46:04.423
She said,

46:04.423 --> 46:05.993
"white face."
So, is the whole

46:05.993 --> 46:06.995
face white?

46:06.995 --> 46:07.997
Your whole
face white.

46:07.997 --> 46:10.669
I say, do a triangle,
pick an eye,

46:10.669 --> 46:13.007
and then two red circles, yes?

46:14.076 --> 46:15.679
SARI:
Where the hell is my brush?

46:15.679 --> 46:18.284
The brush is right here.
I'm holding it for you.

46:18.284 --> 46:19.854
Where's the‐‐ the...
is this the white?

46:19.854 --> 46:21.390
Where'd the whites go?

46:21.390 --> 46:22.392
Thank you.

46:22.392 --> 46:23.529
(bleep)

46:23.529 --> 46:25.566
Excuse my French.

46:25.566 --> 46:29.073
Can I just see her face, real
quick, so I can try to match?

46:29.073 --> 46:30.576
Did you use stain on her lips?

46:30.576 --> 46:31.611
YOLANDA:
What?

46:31.611 --> 46:33.414
KERRI: The stain is
going in the garbage.

46:33.414 --> 46:34.751
We're not cheerleaders.

46:34.751 --> 46:38.391
We don't want the red
to stay on the whole time.

46:38.391 --> 46:40.896
Doing makeup didn't
exactly go as planned,

46:40.896 --> 46:43.101
<i>but I'm staying positive</i>
<i>that we will get this done.</i>

46:43.101 --> 46:45.405
But no thanks
to the elites at all.

46:46.407 --> 46:47.476
ABBY LEE:
Hello!

46:47.476 --> 46:48.679
Hello.
Hi!

46:48.679 --> 46:49.747
All right.

46:49.747 --> 46:51.450
Are we all under
control here?

46:51.450 --> 46:52.887
Well, I don't understand
why the mothers

46:52.887 --> 46:54.189
can't paint the faces white.

46:54.189 --> 46:56.360
JILL: Abby, if you're training
them to be dance moms,

46:56.360 --> 46:57.530
you say, "Get it done."

46:57.530 --> 46:59.133
They should have known
what it looked like.

46:59.133 --> 47:00.435
You would expect that from us.

47:00.435 --> 47:01.905
ABBY LEE:
Well, they can.

47:01.905 --> 47:04.076
I just don't want them
to mess it up.
"Figure it out."

47:04.076 --> 47:06.046
That's your thing.
No, I've said

47:06.046 --> 47:08.384
"Figure it out," but I've also
looked at all of your makeup,

47:08.384 --> 47:10.488
and thought
you look great.

47:10.488 --> 47:11.725
Look at them!

47:11.725 --> 47:13.829
(laughter)

47:13.829 --> 47:15.131
All right, girls,

47:15.131 --> 47:16.400
there's some
really good kids here.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.637
I watched a few solos‐‐
beautiful.

47:17.637 --> 47:19.641
There's some really,
really great stuff

47:19.641 --> 47:21.076
out there that's
probably been

47:21.076 --> 47:22.680
working together for months
and months and months.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.849
No excuse.

47:23.849 --> 47:25.285
Doesn't matter.
The judges don't know

47:25.285 --> 47:26.621
how long you've been
doing this number.

47:26.621 --> 47:28.992
So, get out there, do what
you were taught to do.

47:28.992 --> 47:31.565
Timing, timing,
timing‐‐ crucial.

47:31.565 --> 47:34.102

<i>Brynn was gonna come here</i>

Congratulations.

I‐I think the older girls, I
thought they were beautiful.

56:52.919 --> 56:55.057
But I keep telling you,
if you're given

56:55.057 --> 56:57.261
three turns,
you have to try to do six.

56:57.261 --> 56:59.131
I just want to say it's nice
to lose against, like,

56:59.131 --> 57:01.202
really good people.
Like, I... That's how I feel.

57:01.202 --> 57:03.306
They're‐they're amazing!
KENDALL:
We all looked

57:03.306 --> 57:05.010
at each other, we were
like, "Okay, at least

57:05.010 --> 57:06.513
we lost to really good people."

57:06.513 --> 57:08.851
ABBY LEE: <i>They got beat</i>
<i>at their own game.</i>

57:08.851 --> 57:10.220
Because the overall high score

57:10.220 --> 57:12.926
<i>was not</i>
<i>the Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

57:12.926 --> 57:15.631
It was because the choreography

57:15.631 --> 57:19.740
<i>is not what you put on a stage</i>
<i>at a dance competition,</i>

57:19.740 --> 57:21.710
<i>and that's where they got</i>

57:21.710 --> 57:23.213
a little too big
for their britches

57:23.213 --> 57:26.419
and they didn't remember, "Ooh,

57:26.419 --> 57:29.893
<i>you know what, maybe</i>
<i>I'm getting in over my head."</i>

57:29.893 --> 57:31.663
<i>They need to leave it</i>
<i>in my hands.</i>

57:31.663 --> 57:34.034
I thought the little ones,
they were cute,

57:34.034 --> 57:36.005
they were good.
I mean, like, individually,

57:36.005 --> 57:37.776
doing what they did,
they did well.

57:37.776 --> 57:41.282
But the very
first mistake was

57:41.282 --> 57:44.523
the timing of the music.
They can't hear the music.

57:44.523 --> 57:47.294
<i>The minis won first, but</i>
<i>I thought it was a hot mess.</i>

57:47.294 --> 57:49.465
<i>It should not have won.</i>

57:49.465 --> 57:52.137
<i>There was not one thing that</i>
<i>they actually did together.</i>

57:52.137 --> 57:53.306
<i>I still see</i>

57:53.306 --> 57:56.980
five individual dancers
instead of

57:56.980 --> 57:58.584
<i>one solid group.</i>

57:58.584 --> 58:00.555
<i>They look like</i>

58:00.555 --> 58:03.026
five clowns out there
just clowning around.

58:03.026 --> 58:06.199
JILL: So, Abby,
did the duets play out like

58:06.199 --> 58:07.134
you thought they would?

58:07.134 --> 58:10.875
Uh, Brynn and... Lilli,

58:10.875 --> 58:12.946
I... Brynn, I think

58:12.946 --> 58:14.683
you're really sweet.

58:14.683 --> 58:17.889
I think you were very kind and
helpful to her, but she's good.

58:17.889 --> 58:20.327
That kid has talent.

58:20.327 --> 58:22.765
So maybe you don't need to
coddle and you don't need to be

58:22.765 --> 58:24.134
so sweet all the time.

58:24.134 --> 58:26.205
Maybe it's like, "You know
what, like, come on."

58:26.205 --> 58:27.876
So we can be a little tougher.

58:27.876 --> 58:32.317
As far as Paul‐la
and Elliana go,

58:32.317 --> 58:33.554
uh,

58:33.554 --> 58:35.423
JoJo, uh,

58:35.423 --> 58:38.096
don't ever,
ever, ever, ever

58:38.096 --> 58:40.166
misinterpret

58:40.166 --> 58:41.837
acting as

58:41.837 --> 58:44.709
covering up
to hide something else.

58:44.709 --> 58:46.212
JESSALYNN: You should
just give it to her.

58:46.212 --> 58:48.584
Like, it was good. Like... Yeah.
I do.

58:48.584 --> 58:50.387
I enjoyed the work. I thought
it was great. They won.
JOJO: We still won.

58:50.387 --> 58:52.391
They did great, but...

58:52.391 --> 58:53.894
her legs weren't as straight
as they could've been.

58:53.894 --> 58:55.765
Her feet weren't as
pointed as they could've been.

58:55.765 --> 58:58.904
If you're a dancer, you
want to be the best you can

58:58.904 --> 59:00.608
possibly be, no matter what.

59:00.608 --> 59:01.944
Elliana,

59:01.944 --> 59:03.146
I heard there was
a little incident

59:03.146 --> 59:04.148
when you went off the stage.

59:05.651 --> 59:07.889
That you were upset.

59:07.889 --> 59:09.191
You can't behave like that.

59:10.962 --> 59:12.832
You cry
when you're injured

59:12.832 --> 59:16.840
and you're hurt,
you cry when someone

59:16.840 --> 59:19.879
passes away,
but not in the wings

59:19.879 --> 59:22.384
of the stage
when you just came off

59:22.384 --> 59:23.654
and you screwed something up.

59:23.654 --> 59:26.258
Do you understand that?

59:26.258 --> 59:27.762
ASHLEE:
So then who's doing solos,

59:27.762 --> 59:29.031
juniors or minis?

59:29.031 --> 59:31.035
YOLANDA:
Why couldn't it be both?

59:31.035 --> 59:33.206
Why couldn't it be
one junior, one mini?

59:33.206 --> 59:35.911
Why can't it be my decision?

59:35.911 --> 59:37.114
It should be.
Thank you.

59:37.114 --> 59:38.617
ABBY LEE:
<i>I made the announcement that</i>

59:38.617 --> 59:41.055
the highest‐scoring duet
will get a solo

59:41.055 --> 59:42.625
<i>the following week.</i>

59:42.625 --> 59:44.562
<i>This is gonna be</i>
<i>the first solos of the season.</i>

59:44.562 --> 59:45.564
All right.

59:45.564 --> 59:46.600
Come on, girls.
Let's go!

59:46.600 --> 59:48.102
<i>Ever since Maddie left,</i>

59:48.102 --> 59:50.206
<i>I've been reluctant</i>
<i>to give out any solos,</i>

59:50.206 --> 59:53.046
<i>because I don't have</i>
<i>my go‐to soloist.</i>

59:53.046 --> 59:54.783
<i>I'm not going to make</i>
<i>a hasty decision</i>

59:54.783 --> 59:57.454
<i>and just blurt something out</i>
<i>in front of the moms.</i>

59:57.454 --> 59:58.857
<i>I want to think about this.</i>

59:58.857 --> 1:00:00.661
JESSALYNN: I think
our kids should have solos.

1:00:00.661 --> 1:00:03.399
I don't think your kids
should come in and have solos.

1:00:03.399 --> 1:00:05.437
Why not?
KIRA:
You cry backstage,

1:00:05.437 --> 1:00:08.009
you don't get rewarded.
So that behavior...
But, you know what,

1:00:08.009 --> 1:00:10.447
it's not rewarded, like,
based off the behavior...
She cried because

1:00:10.447 --> 1:00:12.585
she forgot the routine.
Did you not see her?

1:00:12.585 --> 1:00:14.889
For, like, a split second.
And then she covered it.

1:00:14.889 --> 1:00:17.394
She still cried!

1:00:17.394 --> 1:00:19.733
She's eight years old. She's not
perfect. So she learns from it.

1:00:19.733 --> 1:00:21.670
HOLLY: Do you think none of
our kids have ever cried?

1:00:21.670 --> 1:00:23.072
Of course they have.
Okay, 'cause they have,

1:00:23.072 --> 1:00:24.341
and when they have cried...

1:00:24.341 --> 1:00:26.378
It looks like none of
your kids have ever cried,

1:00:26.378 --> 1:00:28.717
the way she's being attacked.

1:00:28.717 --> 1:00:29.919
I'm always the most unhappy
with Yolanda.

1:00:29.919 --> 1:00:31.322
<i>Yolanda's annoying.</i>

1:00:31.322 --> 1:00:32.792
<i>However, I feel like</i>

1:00:32.792 --> 1:00:35.163
<i>the junior moms don't want</i>
<i>to help the minis,</i>

1:00:35.163 --> 1:00:36.265
<i>and I'm so over it.</i>

1:00:36.265 --> 1:00:37.602
HOLLY:
No, what we're saying is that

1:00:37.602 --> 1:00:40.140
our kids have cried. No, listen!
Not because she cries

1:00:40.140 --> 1:00:41.777
and she shows emotion.
We're saying our kids...

1:00:41.777 --> 1:00:43.179
No, listen...
STACEY:
Do you feel attacked?

1:00:43.179 --> 1:00:45.684
Yeah. I'm just saying...
She feels attacked.

1:00:45.684 --> 1:00:47.454
YOLANDA:
She's eight years old!
You're not listening!

1:00:47.454 --> 1:00:48.957
No, I'm just saying
she's eight years old.

1:00:48.957 --> 1:00:51.162
If she cries, that has nothing
to do with her dance.

1:00:51.162 --> 1:00:52.832
Listen for one second!
One second.

1:00:52.832 --> 1:00:54.669
One second. Shh!
I...

1:00:54.669 --> 1:00:56.873
Our kids have cried.

1:00:56.873 --> 1:00:59.546
Abby usually reacts not in
a nice way like she did today.

1:00:59.546 --> 1:01:01.783
That was Abby nice.

1:01:01.783 --> 1:01:05.791
Normally, you cry, you get
a pillowcase over your head.

1:01:05.791 --> 1:01:07.595
Getting a pillowcase
on your head is not that sweet.
STACEY: That's fine.

1:01:07.595 --> 1:01:08.597
We're talking about
the delivery.

1:01:08.597 --> 1:01:10.066
That doesn't sound like advice,

1:01:10.066 --> 1:01:11.502
when someone's screaming
that your kid shouldn't get...

1:01:11.502 --> 1:01:14.041
We're not screaming.
Were you being screamed at?

1:01:14.041 --> 1:01:16.378
It sounded loud to me.
Do not expect a solo if you cry.

1:01:16.378 --> 1:01:17.715
That's all.
I think my ears work properly,

1:01:17.715 --> 1:01:19.318
and I can hear
when someone's yelling.

1:01:19.318 --> 1:01:22.892
ASHLEE: Stacey, can I give you
some advice, as new to new?

1:01:22.892 --> 1:01:25.363
You need to stop talking
a little bit and listen

1:01:25.363 --> 1:01:26.700
a little bit more,
'cause you're not getting

1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:28.035
some of the things
we're saying.

1:01:28.035 --> 1:01:29.104
You're always
being defensive.
I hear just fine.

1:01:29.104 --> 1:01:30.373
Just listen.

1:01:30.373 --> 1:01:31.943
I can do whatever I want!

1:01:31.943 --> 1:01:33.079
Okay, well, let me know
how that works out for you.

1:01:33.079 --> 1:01:34.248
Okay, you, too.
Okay.

1:01:34.248 --> 1:01:36.085
Well, it's great for me.
I'm fine, so...

1:01:36.085 --> 1:01:39.124
I have a really good idea.
Let's leave them here

1:01:39.124 --> 1:01:40.895
and see how they do.

1:01:42.430 --> 1:01:45.336
STACEY:
Bye, Felicias.

1:01:45.336 --> 1:01:46.840
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:47.808
We have three solos.

1:01:47.808 --> 1:01:48.944
<i>First solos of the season.</i>

1:01:48.944 --> 1:01:50.146
<i>As far as the minis</i>

1:01:50.146 --> 1:01:52.183
are concerned,
you are not competing.

1:01:52.183 --> 1:01:53.185
What?

1:01:53.185 --> 1:01:54.722
Welcome back, Abby!

1:01:54.722 --> 1:01:56.559
(women cheering)
Abby's back!

1:01:58.162 --> 1:02:00.834
Abby does no longer manage
Kendall's music.

1:02:00.834 --> 1:02:02.304
HOLLY:
<i>You can do your own thing.</i>

1:02:02.304 --> 1:02:05.009
So she's gonna be pissed.

1:02:05.009 --> 1:02:06.813
You're nobody.
And you're nothing.

1:02:06.813 --> 1:02:08.482
JILL:
<i>I can't</i>

1:02:08.482 --> 1:02:10.219
even begin.

1:02:10.219 --> 1:02:12.858
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>any of this crap around here.</i>

1:02:12.858 --> 1:02:15.564
Okay, you're ignorant.
I'm not staying here.

1:02:15.564 --> 1:02:18.469
The last O. G. will be gone.
I think she's probably suing me.
