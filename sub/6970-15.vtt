01:21.981 --> 01:24.711
Get the tape. Get it. lt's in the back.

01:26.653 --> 01:27.881
Come on!

01:36.162 --> 01:39.097
lt's all right. You don't have to do this.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.156
No, l want to.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.850
Why are you doing this?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.264
Come.

04:43.783 --> 04:48.277
His name was lsaac Luria. He lived
in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.

04:48.354 --> 04:51.687
Home to a sect of Hasidic Jews
since the late 19th century.

04:51.758 --> 04:56.525
Also known for racial tension and hate crimes
- Yankel Rosenbaum, Tawana Brawley...

04:56.596 --> 05:00.623
Now lsaac Luria - murdered two days ago
in the market that he owned.

05:00.700 --> 05:04.363
Severely beaten and shot five times
at pointblank range.

05:05.071 --> 05:09.838
Police ruled out robbery 'cause the only thing
that was missing was this videotape

05:09.909 --> 05:14.403
from the surveillance camera.
Police found it early this morning.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.613
Where?

05:17.750 --> 05:20.651
ln the VCR of a 16-year-old
named Tony Oliver.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.987
That's him on the upper right.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.151
Has he been arrested?

05:28.227 --> 05:29.956
No.

05:30.029 --> 05:31.621
Because he's dead.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.360
He'd been watching this tape
when he was strangled.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.992
Very Old Testament.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.503
Yeah, but with a new twist.

05:38.571 --> 05:42.200
Brooklyn Homicide
contacted the FBl's civil rights branch

05:42.275 --> 05:45.472
with an interesting set of prints
from the boy's body.

05:45.545 --> 05:49.037
- lnteresting how?
- They belonged to lsaac Luria.

05:49.916 --> 05:53.113
Risen from the grave
to avenge his own death?

05:53.186 --> 05:57.145
Some might assume that. lt's probably
what someone would like us to think.

05:57.223 --> 06:01.057
- But you have your own idea.
- l think that this is a crime of hatred,

06:01.127 --> 06:05.655
like the crime that spawned it.
A hatred that goes back 4,000 years.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.292
But masquerading as something else here.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.633
A callow attempt at murderous retribution

06:11.704 --> 06:13.934
disguised as spectral justice.

06:14.006 --> 06:16.941
- A resurrection hoax?
- And not a very good one.

06:17.009 --> 06:22.106
Spectral figures are not often known
to leave fingerprints. Casper never did.

06:22.715 --> 06:26.116
Somehow the killer got hold
of lsaac Luria's fingerprints.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.751
And we have been asked to prove how.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.721
Excuse me, sir. We're with the FBl.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.761
We'd like to speak with Ariel Luria.

06:38.998 --> 06:42.195
- ls she home?
- l'm Ariel's father, Jacob Weiss.

06:43.002 --> 06:47.268
Why are you bothering her again?
She's already spoken with the police.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.467
lt's all right. Let them in.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.043
Please, come in.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.677
Thank you.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.077
We can talk in the study.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.523
This is why you are here?

07:13.599 --> 07:17.296
This is what you come to ask
in this house of mourning?

07:20.640 --> 07:21.800
What is this?

07:21.874 --> 07:25.002
We'd like your permission
to reopen lsaac's grave.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.068
No! The answer's no!

07:29.415 --> 07:31.781
Why does this have to be done?

07:31.851 --> 07:37.050
We're looking for evidence in the murder
of this young man. His name is Tony Oliver.

07:37.824 --> 07:40.657
He's one of three suspects
in your husband's murder.

07:40.726 --> 07:46.460
We believe it was an attack of retaliation
and that the other two suspects are targets.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.365
- He's just a boy.
- He's an animal.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.700
A monster, like the others who killed lsaac.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.775
Whose grave you're asking us to desecrate
so you can protect them.

07:56.843 --> 07:57.639
Tate, please.

07:57.710 --> 08:01.669
But where were you
when lsaac needed your protection?

08:04.917 --> 08:08.284
When we called the police,
they said that we were paranoid.

08:08.354 --> 08:11.084
That there was nothing to worry about.

08:11.591 --> 08:14.492
They always say that
when someone threatens the Jews.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.858
So there was a threat of violence?

08:16.929 --> 08:19.762
The threat is always there.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.158
Just this morning,

08:24.103 --> 08:26.469
this is what l found under our door.

08:28.074 --> 08:31.510
And now you've come here not to help us,

08:31.577 --> 08:35.741
but to ask our help
so you can impose yourjustice

08:35.815 --> 08:39.148
on the only man
who's taken justice into his own hands.

08:39.217 --> 08:43.484
We'd be happy not to disturb the grave
if you could tell us who that man is.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.888
Even if l knew, why would l tell you?

08:45.958 --> 08:51.089
Because this is a homicide investigation
and you are required by law to assist us.

08:51.163 --> 08:54.030
l know all about your laws.

08:55.401 --> 09:01.601
l'm afraid that even without your consent, we
can get a court order to exhume lsaac's grave.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.342
Do what you feel is necessary.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.949
But leave us alone.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.282
Let us mourn in peace.

09:34.774 --> 09:38.005
l have a feeling he knows
who killed Tony Oliver.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.877
He doesn't want us disturbing the grave
because he knows what we'll find.

09:41.948 --> 09:46.851
Maybe. But it's hard to fault his attitude
when you see something like that.

09:46.919 --> 09:51.379
Anybody delivering justice to a people
who've known that kind of hatred,

09:51.457 --> 09:54.017
- who wouldn't protect 'em?
- Justice or revenge?

09:54.093 --> 09:58.587
l'm not saying those kids don't warrant
prosecution, but the hate goes both ways.

09:58.664 --> 10:02.100
But the right to free expression
doesn't extend to murder.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.660
l bet whoever published that
knows who killed lsaac Luria,

10:05.738 --> 10:09.196
and has a good idea
who killed Tony Oliver too.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.795
l knew him.
He owned the store across the street.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.802
But l'd be lying if l said
l was surprised it happened.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.497
Why's that?

10:39.572 --> 10:41.597
Well, you know how they are.

10:42.008 --> 10:46.741
Always trying to find ways to make money
off of honest folk who work for a living.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.043
Can you think of anyone who held a grudge?

10:50.116 --> 10:53.711
- l can't think of anyone who didn't.
- Did you?

10:53.786 --> 10:58.120
Why? l'm not... under
any kind of suspicion, am l?

10:58.190 --> 11:01.023
No, not directly, but these young men are.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.186
We have reason to believe you know them.

11:03.262 --> 11:06.060
Their names are Derek Banks
and Clinton Macguire.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.965
l'm sorry, l'm not familiar with them.

11:09.035 --> 11:11.401
Well, are you familiar with this?

11:12.805 --> 11:18.300
We think those kids are familiar with it.
Enough to incite them to murder lsaac Luria.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.371
- You work for them too.
- Who?

11:22.448 --> 11:25.383
You know who.
You look like you might be one yourself.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.982
We work for the FBl, sir.

11:29.055 --> 11:31.649
Who's the FBl work for?

11:31.791 --> 11:33.190
That's right.

11:33.259 --> 11:37.719
You call me paranoid, 'cause
that's exactly what they want you to do.

11:37.797 --> 11:42.825
But there is one thing you can't call me
and that is a Zionist collaborator.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.666
You take a long look at these photos.

11:45.738 --> 11:49.299
lt may be your last chance to save their lives.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.906
One of their accomplices,

11:52.978 --> 11:56.379
Tony Oliver,
was found murdered this morning.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.009
- Why tell me this?
- You haven't heard the rumors?

11:59.085 --> 12:02.543
- What rumors?
- That Luria is back from the dead.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.987
That he's risen from his grave.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.020
What kind of Jew trick is this?

12:09.161 --> 12:11.561
A Jew pulled it off 2,000 years ago.

12:14.867 --> 12:19.736
We're just relating the evidence, sir.
You can draw your own conclusions.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.966
But l know you wouldn't
want to be responsible for

12:23.042 --> 12:26.341
endangering these young men's lives.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.775
Bless you.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.460
Derek?

13:01.046 --> 13:02.775
You sure about this?

13:02.848 --> 13:06.648
l heard them, man.
l'm not waiting around to find out if it's true.

13:36.849 --> 13:37.838
Damn!

13:37.917 --> 13:40.215
- What's wrong?
- lt's nailed shut.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.447
There's some tools in the trunk.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.708
l got it open, man! Get down here!

14:18.224 --> 14:20.215
Clinton. Check it out.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.894
Clinton. Check it out.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.601
You trying to mess with me?

14:44.183 --> 14:45.480
Oh, man.

15:30.362 --> 15:35.925
The ligature marks on the victim's neck
are consistent with our vigilante's MO.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.026
Forensics come up with anything?

15:38.103 --> 15:42.096
A second set of footprints,
but the mud was too soft to take a mold.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.836
My guess is
Clinton was here with Derek Banks.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.901
Looking for what?

15:55.487 --> 16:00.584
Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse
as retribution for Tony Oliver's death.

16:00.659 --> 16:04.595
Seems pretty redundant.
Messing up somebody you've already killed?

16:04.663 --> 16:07.632
l think they came here
because they were afraid.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.327
Afraid?

16:11.837 --> 16:16.035
Afraid that the man they hated enough
to kill wasn't really dead.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.739
Look.

16:18.811 --> 16:23.248
There goes your theory of how Luria's
prints got onto the victim's body.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.344
What does that look like to you?

16:28.287 --> 16:31.222
The body wasn't embalmed,
as according to custom.

16:31.290 --> 16:35.021
Maybe it's postmortem lividity
or some kind of tattooing.

16:35.094 --> 16:38.188
lt's hard to tell
at this stage of decomposition.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.660
What's this?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.096
A little bedtime reading?

17:15.367 --> 17:18.564
- You owe me for two weeks.
- Where have you been?

17:20.239 --> 17:24.198
ls it true?
You and your friends killed the Jew?

17:24.276 --> 17:25.903
Just give me my money.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.571
What the hell were you thinking?

17:30.649 --> 17:33.277
l never told you to kill anyone.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.183
No?

17:35.254 --> 17:38.417
What did you expect me to do?

17:38.490 --> 17:44.122
Hide back here like you, licking envelopes
in the dark, calling them names?

17:44.229 --> 17:46.823
We're working to spread the truth.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.628
The truth?

17:49.768 --> 17:51.827
You're as pathetic as they are.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.700
l am exposing their lies.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.800
Those are just words.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.978
You think they killed my friends with words?

18:06.785 --> 18:09.447
That's right. Clinton's dead too.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.019
Now l'd like my money.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.129
lt's called the Sefer Yezirah,
the Book of Creation.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.603
The earliest known Hebrew text on man's
mystical communion with the divine.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.333
- ls it ever buried with the dead?
- No.

18:28.407 --> 18:33.140
ln observance with the Jewish belief,
the corpse is buried only in its shroud.

18:33.245 --> 18:37.409
No personal symbols of class
or worldly position are allowed.

18:37.483 --> 18:41.146
Has it ever been known
to spontaneously combust?

18:42.654 --> 18:44.349
No. No, it hasn't.

18:44.423 --> 18:47.517
lt's a book on mysticism,
not mysticism itself.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.994
ls it printed on special paper
or with special ink?

18:51.063 --> 18:53.691
No, it's just a book. Leather and paper.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.666
l suspect somebody's
playing a trick on you.

18:56.735 --> 19:00.501
Possibly moisture
may have leeched into the coffin,

19:00.572 --> 19:03.063
into the binding and the pages of the book.

19:03.342 --> 19:09.975
lf the groundwater was contaminated, arsine
gas could've created a combustible mixture.

19:12.351 --> 19:17.254
ls there anything that distinguishes this
particular Sefer Yezirah from other books?

19:17.356 --> 19:21.258
Yes, but it's barely legible
because of the burning.

19:22.060 --> 19:25.552
lt's a name engraved in the leather,
or stamped into the leather.

19:26.265 --> 19:29.098
- A name?
- Yes, a Hebrew name.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.267
Weiss.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.167
Jacob Weiss.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.600
Jacob Weiss.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.707
Why do you want to see him?

19:39.978 --> 19:41.912
There's been another murder.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.916
Another suspect in your husband's death
was found dead last night.

19:45.984 --> 19:49.112
- Where was this?
- Next to your husband's grave.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.448
How does this concern my father?

19:52.524 --> 19:56.016
He expressed strong feelings
towards this victim.

19:56.094 --> 19:58.824
He was angry. They were angry words.

19:58.897 --> 20:02.333
And we found evidence
placing him at the crime scene.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.770
This is escalating into something else, Ariel.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.935
Something that has to stop.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.906
My marriage to lsaac...

20:20.118 --> 20:23.417
You have to understand how much
it would have meant to my father.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.819
''Would have meant''?

20:24.890 --> 20:30.726
We got our marriage license a few weeks ago,
but the wedding wasn't until today.

20:34.299 --> 20:35.994
l'm sorry.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.165
l'd like to show you something.

20:40.973 --> 20:45.433
lt was a communal wedding ring
made in Kolin, a village near Prague.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.507
My father was an apprentice
to the man who designed it.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.912
lt's beautiful.

20:55.787 --> 21:00.690
Every woman who got married in the
synagogue wore this ring as a symbol that

21:00.759 --> 21:02.693
she was a queen,

21:02.761 --> 21:04.956
her husband a king,

21:05.030 --> 21:09.057
and the home they made a castle,
not only on their wedding day,

21:09.134 --> 21:11.864
but for the rest of their lives together.

21:11.937 --> 21:16.806
But most of those lives ended
in one day in the spring of 1943.

21:16.875 --> 21:20.971
9,000 Jews were massacred
after digging their own graves.

21:21.046 --> 21:23.241
But your father survived.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.942
Because he was ten years old
and he was ajeweler's apprentice.

21:28.020 --> 21:31.979
He had small fingers
to make bullets at a munitions factory.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.955
And through all this he hid the ring?

21:35.761 --> 21:39.697
Even after the war, he hid it.
Even from my mother.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.756
Why?

21:42.634 --> 21:46.730
Because to him it was a dead relic
from a forgotten place.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.470
Until the day that l told him
l was getting married.

21:53.545 --> 21:57.242
And for the first time in 50 years,
he took out this ring.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.615
He said he felt his village was born again.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.721
He knew how much l loved lsaac.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.959
Ariel, tell us where your father is.

22:11.029 --> 22:14.726
l know my father.
He would never kill anyone.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.733
What if you're wrong?

23:00.779 --> 23:02.713
Do you see him?

23:12.924 --> 23:17.020
- l'm sorry. We don't mean any disrespect.
- Who are you?

23:17.095 --> 23:19.495
We're looking for Jacob Weiss.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.792
Why?

24:06.845 --> 24:08.244
Mulder.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.729
Don't move! Federal agent!

25:06.705 --> 25:07.899
You OK, Mulder?

25:09.074 --> 25:10.098
Yeah.

25:11.443 --> 25:14.935
Put your hands in the air
where l can see them.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.004
And turn around slowly.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.918
l got him, Scully.

25:27.058 --> 25:30.391
Mr Weiss, we're placing you under arrest.

25:40.005 --> 25:41.495
Come on.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.040
Let's go.

26:08.199 --> 26:10.895
Where is he? Where's my father?

26:12.404 --> 26:16.363
We've arrested him, Ariel,
under suspicion of murder.

26:16.441 --> 26:19.274
l don't believe you. lt can't be him.

26:20.545 --> 26:23.343
Did he tell you he killed this person?

26:24.149 --> 26:28.176
l think that's the direction it's going.
Agent Mulder's with him now.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.277
l need to see him.

26:29.354 --> 26:34.417
- Ariel, l suggest you get him an attorney.
- l need to see him!

26:40.298 --> 26:42.766
Ask Detective Bartley down the hall.

26:42.834 --> 26:47.464
He'll give you a place to wait
until your father's been processed.

26:48.139 --> 26:49.470
Ariel...

26:50.575 --> 26:51.837
l'm sorry.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.578
Why'd you kill him, Jacob?

27:02.087 --> 27:06.285
Our synagogue has been vandalized
13 times in the last year.

27:07.592 --> 27:12.552
l heard a noise in the attic. l went up
to see what it was and he attacked me.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.859
lt was self-defense.

27:13.965 --> 27:18.026
- Hanging a man in self-defense?
- ls it worse than what they did to lsaac?

27:18.136 --> 27:20.127
ls it any better?

27:20.972 --> 27:25.500
They found your book,
your Sefer Yezirah in lsaac Luria's grave.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.813
- So?
- That puts you at a second crime scene.

27:31.883 --> 27:33.908
l'm guilty. What more do you want?

27:33.985 --> 27:36.476
- The truth.
- l have given you the truth!

27:36.554 --> 27:40.183
There was someone else
in that attic with you. Who was it?

27:40.959 --> 27:43.154
There was no one else.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.219
Then you're a liar.

27:45.296 --> 27:49.426
And you know nothing about nothing.
And l have no more to say about this.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.934
l would like to see my daughter.

28:10.922 --> 28:13.755
Wanna see the background check
l ran on him?

28:13.825 --> 28:19.695
He emigrated to lsrael after WWll and joined
the lrgun - the Jewish military underground.

28:19.764 --> 28:25.202
He was arrested in 1959 by the British
for a bombing that killed seven civilians.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.795
He was a terrorist, Mulder. A killer.

28:28.807 --> 28:33.005
- Not our killer though.
- He just confessed. l stood here and listened.

28:33.078 --> 28:36.377
l think there was
a second person in that attic.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.678
Weiss is protecting whoever it is.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.808
Who? His daughter?

28:39.884 --> 28:42.751
lt was somebody strong enough
to knock me down.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.221
Well, who do you think it was?

28:49.994 --> 28:52.087
Stick around. This could be interesting.

28:52.163 --> 28:55.530
- Where are you going?
- To see a man about a burning book.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.064
They say you confessed.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.411
- Why are you doing this?
- To protect you.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.846
- From what?
- l think you know.

29:11.616 --> 29:14.983
They found my book in lsaac's grave.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.082
- lt can't be true.
- No?

30:10.475 --> 30:13.273
There's something you didn't tell me

30:16.080 --> 30:19.413
about the contents of this Sefer Yezirah.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.847
- What is it you want to know?
- The myth of the golem.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.980
l told you, Mr Mulder. This is a mystical text.

30:26.057 --> 30:30.756
These pages are filled with golems and
dybbuks and demons of all sizes and shapes.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.763
lt's the golem l'm interested in.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.631
l'm interested in why an FBl agent
would be so interested in such a thing.

30:36.701 --> 30:39.465
That's what l was hoping you could tell me.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.901
The early cabalists

30:44.876 --> 30:50.815
believed a righteous man could actually
create a living being from the earth itself.

30:50.882 --> 30:53.146
Fashioned from mud or clay.

30:53.218 --> 30:57.746
But this creature could only be brought
to life by the power of the word.

30:58.223 --> 31:00.214
ln practical terms,

31:01.226 --> 31:06.061
by a direct application
of certain secret letter-combinations.

31:06.164 --> 31:08.792
Combinations found in that book?

31:11.669 --> 31:13.864
See? These pages.

31:13.938 --> 31:17.999
They're basically instructions
for animating the inanimate.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.678
And this...

31:22.313 --> 31:24.247
Yeah, this passage here

31:24.315 --> 31:28.012
talks about inscribing a single word
on the golem itself.

31:28.119 --> 31:30.781
- On the back of his hand?
- l'm impressed.

31:30.855 --> 31:33.790
- What is the magic word?
- Emet.

31:35.827 --> 31:38.091
See, these three letters,

31:38.663 --> 31:41.427
alef, mem, tav,

31:41.532 --> 31:43.762
creates the word ''emet.''

31:44.102 --> 31:46.366
l don't know what that means.

31:46.437 --> 31:47.870
Truth.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.463
''Emet'' means ''truth.''

31:51.509 --> 31:52.908
But you see,

31:53.645 --> 31:56.512
Mr Mulder, therein lies the paradox.

31:56.614 --> 32:01.984
Because the danger of the truth
is contained in the word ''golem'' itself,

32:02.053 --> 32:05.318
which means ''matter without form,
body without soul.''

32:05.390 --> 32:07.984
So the golem is an imperfect creation.

32:08.059 --> 32:11.825
A kind of monster, really.
Unable to speak or feel anything

32:11.896 --> 32:13.989
but the most primitive emotions.

32:14.098 --> 32:19.229
ln the legends, it runs amok...
and has to be destroyed by its creator.

32:19.304 --> 32:20.771
Destroyed how?

32:23.641 --> 32:26.075
By erasing

32:26.144 --> 32:28.544
the first letter, alef,

32:28.613 --> 32:30.706
''emet'' becomes ''met,''

32:31.950 --> 32:33.941
which means ''dead.''

32:35.486 --> 32:38.284
Again, Mr Mulder,

32:38.356 --> 32:40.153
the power of letters.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.556
Notjust to create, but to kill.

32:46.264 --> 32:50.064
- Yeah?
- Mulder, there's been another homicide.

32:50.702 --> 32:51.361
Who?

32:51.436 --> 32:54.428
Curt Brunjes.
l'm on my way to the print shop.

32:54.505 --> 32:56.200
l'll be there in ten minutes.

33:06.584 --> 33:10.543
A man on a mission. Look at all
the energy he spent spreading his hatred.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.646
He wasn't toiling in obscurity.

33:12.724 --> 33:16.717
This mailing list has hundreds of names,
including our murder victims.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.194
At least we know
Jacob Weiss didn't kill them.

33:19.263 --> 33:21.390
l'll have him released.

33:21.466 --> 33:23.263
Agent Scully?

33:27.105 --> 33:29.630
The image is fuzzy, but l think we've got a hit.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.232
- There.
- Oh, my God.

33:34.145 --> 33:36.340
lt's lsaac Luria.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.780
He's still alive.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.614
l'm not so sure about that.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.865
No, thank you. That won't be necessary.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.670
The coroner matched Luria's dental records.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.768
lt was his corpse that was in that grave.

34:08.846 --> 34:12.976
You know, this videotape,
it must have been altered somehow.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.518
Planted by whoever is staging this hoax.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.521
lt's not a hoax, Scully. lt never was.

34:18.589 --> 34:23.356
- But if Luria is dead...
- This is not Luria. Not really.

34:23.428 --> 34:25.896
Who do you think it is? Some kind of ghost?

34:25.963 --> 34:28.056
No, a ghost is spirit without form.

34:28.132 --> 34:33.126
But l believe what we're looking for and what
we're seeing here is form without spirit.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.467
- Something called a golem.
- A golem?

34:35.540 --> 34:39.636
Yeah, it's a kind of a manmade monster
described in Jewish folklore.

34:39.710 --> 34:44.272
lt's fashioned from mud and then
animated through mystical incantation.

34:44.348 --> 34:45.975
Mud?

34:46.918 --> 34:51.685
Mulder, what are you talking about?
And for what purpose? Exacting revenge?

34:51.755 --> 34:56.887
l don't think it was hate that created
this golem, Scully. l think it was love.

35:00.898 --> 35:03.594
Ariel, it's Agent Mulder. Open the door.

35:09.807 --> 35:11.502
lt's not locked.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.580
Ariel?

35:19.784 --> 35:21.979
She's not here, Scully.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.682
How do you know?

35:24.889 --> 35:27.449
Because it's her wedding day.

36:37.361 --> 36:38.885
Ariel?

36:42.500 --> 36:45.799
l know you're here. l know you can hear me.

36:48.839 --> 36:49.931
Ariel?

36:52.009 --> 36:54.944
Leave us alone, Tate. You don't belong here.

36:55.746 --> 36:58.146
- l'm your father.
- Please go.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.084
Not without you. l'm not leaving without you.

37:02.153 --> 37:05.486
- l want to see him.
- He's dead.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.319
lsaac is dead.

37:07.458 --> 37:08.049
No!

37:08.192 --> 37:12.356
The boys that killed him,
their hate took him from you,

37:14.232 --> 37:17.463
and you tried bringing him back
with your love.

37:19.303 --> 37:22.067
But what you brought back,

37:22.139 --> 37:25.006
you have to understand, Ariel,

37:26.143 --> 37:27.667
it isn't him.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.613
lt's an abomination.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.846
lt has no place among the living.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.246
He said he'd call me back, Tate.

37:39.991 --> 37:42.391
We were talking on the phone

37:42.460 --> 37:44.257
about the wedding.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.855
lsaac said he had to go.

37:47.698 --> 37:51.600
That a customer needed him,
and that he would call me back.

37:53.337 --> 37:58.172
But when l heard the phone ring later,
something told me not to pick it up.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.542
A woman's voice was on the line.

38:03.681 --> 38:06.013
l didn't hear what she was saying.

38:07.151 --> 38:09.312
l didn't have to.

38:09.387 --> 38:12.117
l knew lsaac wasn't calling me back.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.928
l was just wanted to say good-bye, Tate.

38:20.665 --> 38:21.996
l know.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.436
l know.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.038
l didn't think.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.409
lt was just a wish.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.189
They were just...

38:50.494 --> 38:51.188
words.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.158
- Stay here.
- l want to go with you.

38:57.234 --> 38:58.132
- No.
- Tate!

39:36.907 --> 39:39.205
Wait, l got a knife.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.031
- His pulse is thready.
- Will he be OK?

40:08.105 --> 40:10.938
- lf we get him to a hospital.
- Call the paramedics.

40:11.008 --> 40:13.841
- Where are you going?
- To find Ariel.

40:38.836 --> 40:40.303
Ariel?

40:46.243 --> 40:49.542
We found your father.
He's alive. He's gonna be OK.

40:51.549 --> 40:53.540
l know about lsaac.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.247
Where is he?

40:58.322 --> 41:00.222
l don't know.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.894
OK. We've gotta get out of here.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.258
No.

41:05.329 --> 41:07.092
- Come on, Ariel. Let's go.
- No.

41:07.164 --> 41:10.224
We have to go. Come on, Ariel. Come on.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.236
lsaac?

41:15.773 --> 41:17.536
- Stop or l'll fire!
- No! No!

41:34.492 --> 41:35.516
lsaac!

42:10.427 --> 42:12.622
l am to my beloved

42:12.696 --> 42:14.527
as my beloved is to me.

42:51.468 --> 42:53.459
l loved you.

43:13.724 --> 43:14.952
Mulder?

43:16.026 --> 43:18.017
Are you OK?

43:18.095 --> 43:20.529
l heard shots fired.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.426
What happened?

43:36.580 --> 43:38.445
What is she doing?

43:38.515 --> 43:39.982
Saying good-bye.
