00:06.000 --> 00:07.541
<i>Previously on </i>The Recruit:

00:08.541 --> 00:11.291
Why can't I find an official record
of my graymailer?

00:11.375 --> 00:14.000
-Someone cleaned up their mess.
-Her handler?

00:14.083 --> 00:16.708
A guy like that finds out
you're poking around his old ops,

00:16.791 --> 00:19.333
and you end up in a dark room
with plastic on the floor.

00:19.416 --> 00:21.875
There's a case officer in Vienna
who might be the key

00:21.958 --> 00:25.000
to understanding how dangerous
my squeaky wheel is.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.375
Go. But be careful.

00:26.458 --> 00:30.416
I am in Vienna, and I know
what you're threatening to expose too.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.541
You talked to somebody.
Tell me their name.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.208
Nope. One thing you don't have,
real names.

00:35.291 --> 00:38.166
I need you to give me everything
you have on Max Meladze.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.250
-She's making threats, isn't she?
-Does that idea make you nervous?

00:42.125 --> 00:45.083
The secrets I know
are worth killing to keep quiet.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.666
This person definitely
has secrets to hide.

00:47.750 --> 00:51.125
-This isn't her cab.
-She's an assassin. You'll be killed.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.625
-What is going on?
-I'm out of the car.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.041
-I'm stuck on a bridge. What do I do?
-Can you swim?

01:04.125 --> 01:05.041
Fuck!

01:42.375 --> 01:43.416
Are you okay?

01:43.500 --> 01:46.291
Yeah, I got mugged,
had to jump off the bridge--

01:47.791 --> 01:49.375
Wait, I recognize you.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.750
And you. And you.

01:53.291 --> 01:57.541
-You guys have been following me.
-Here. Take this. You need to warm up.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.166
-Thank you.
-There's a tracker.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.458
-And a bug.
-<i>Bié,</i> don't put it on.

02:02.541 --> 02:05.625
We agreed we all talk to him,
or none of us do. And no tricks.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.750
-Sorry. Old habits.
-Wait, you guys are spies.

02:08.833 --> 02:11.291
No. No, we're legal attachés.

02:11.375 --> 02:14.875
It's very funny except for the fact
that I am actually just a lawyer.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.791
Then, why did someone
try to kill you?

02:17.416 --> 02:18.625
I never said that.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.791
I said that I got mugged
and jumped in the river.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.750
And what did this mugger look like?

02:29.458 --> 02:30.916
There were two of them.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.833
It was a hangry blond girl,
and then the dude was a zaddy.

02:36.083 --> 02:40.625
-You know, fashionista, sexy guy.
-Yeah, Myka and what's-his-name.

02:40.708 --> 02:44.833
I don't understand. I'm nobody.
I'm a lawyer for the State Department.

02:46.166 --> 02:50.208
I am. If I worked in Intelligence,
you think I'd be so bad at it?

02:50.291 --> 02:51.375
Okay.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.666
If you tell us why you're in Vienna,

02:54.750 --> 02:56.875
maybe we figure out
who hired them to kill you.

02:56.958 --> 02:59.916
It's funny. This guy. I'll pass.

03:00.791 --> 03:03.416
-You don't trust us.
-No. Is that surprising?

03:04.041 --> 03:06.250
If you could tell me
how I get back to my hotel,

03:06.333 --> 03:08.375
I could take off this very wet suit.

03:09.583 --> 03:11.958
You don't know anything
about counterintelligence.

03:12.041 --> 03:15.458
If you did, you would know
you can't go back to that hotel

03:16.166 --> 03:18.458
unless you wanna give Myka
and what's-his-name

03:18.541 --> 03:20.333
another shot at killing you.

03:51.583 --> 03:52.416
Hi.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.083
Hey, can I ask a really big favor?

04:05.041 --> 04:08.000
-No.
-I totally understand that. It's just...

04:09.208 --> 04:11.416
I grew up on army bases.

04:12.041 --> 04:13.583
Spent a year here at Ramstein.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.041
And I was bullied every day.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.291
It was hard, you know, being the new kid.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.416
Year after year.

04:21.666 --> 04:25.500
Anyway, I have to go change my clothes
in the airport bathroom,

04:25.583 --> 04:28.833
and I'm having a panic attack about it.

04:28.916 --> 04:33.250
Could I possibly just jump into
your back room and do it?

04:58.750 --> 04:59.791
<i>It's me.</i>

05:00.458 --> 05:03.041
Oh, good. You're not dead.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.916
Wow. That almost sounded
like you meant it.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.750
They would just send another lawyer.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.708
-They still could, Max.
<i>-Don't be like that.</i>

05:09.791 --> 05:12.458
Right now, I'm the only person
you can trust isn't trying to kill you.

05:12.541 --> 05:13.458
Nice try.

05:14.416 --> 05:17.208
You're just trying to supersize
my paranoia about the agency,

05:17.291 --> 05:20.375
so that I'll depend on you more,
but not gonna work.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.875
<i>Who tried to kill me?</i>

05:21.958 --> 05:25.083
Who did you meet with?
Because it's probably them.

05:27.833 --> 05:30.666
Not gonna happen.
You're already a dumpster fire.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.458
I'm not giving you more fuel.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.791
I definitely won't open myself up
to criminal liability

05:35.875 --> 05:37.625
by telling you an officer's name.

05:37.708 --> 05:40.833
They're only trying to kill you because
they're worried I'll share secrets,

05:40.916 --> 05:43.041
which I won't if you get me the fuck out.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.125
Look.

05:47.916 --> 05:49.875
If all goes well at the hearing,

05:49.958 --> 05:53.583
you'll be transferred into
a federal facility before the afternoon.

05:53.666 --> 05:57.791
No, out of prison is the demand,
not to a different one.

05:57.875 --> 06:00.958
You have two days to do it.
Otherwise, I start naming names.

06:25.125 --> 06:26.041
Uh-oh.

06:27.083 --> 06:27.916
Yes, sir.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.416
Come on.

06:40.625 --> 06:41.875
What are you wearing?

06:42.375 --> 06:44.791
Sorry, I came straight from the airport.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.875
I got mugged, and my suit got ruined.

06:50.666 --> 06:52.541
-Mugged?
-Yes, sir.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.416
Are you okay?

06:55.166 --> 06:56.083
Um...

06:57.166 --> 06:58.666
Yeah. No, totally.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.125
Have you eaten anything today?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.083
I'm not sure.

07:06.666 --> 07:07.500
Here.

07:08.583 --> 07:09.666
My kids love them.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.208
How many kids do you have?

07:14.833 --> 07:15.666
Five.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Wow.

07:18.583 --> 07:19.416
No shit.

07:20.666 --> 07:24.625
So, what happened in Vienna?
Any clarity on our exposure risk?

07:25.416 --> 07:29.666
Yes, sir, if our asset follows through
on her threats,

07:29.750 --> 07:33.000
she has the ability to expose
a significant number of our local assets

07:33.083 --> 07:34.375
in Belarus and Russia.

07:34.458 --> 07:37.375
We'll lose almost all intelligence
gathering capabilities in the region.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.166
Jesus.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.125
-And this woman's in jail for murder?
-Yes, sir.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.333
Like, a bad one?

07:44.416 --> 07:47.791
Yes, sir. She beat a man to death.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.375
But, I'm having the Justice Department
take over her prosecution.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.458
There is a transfer hearing this morning.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.125
Go down there,
make sure nothing goes wrong.

07:58.875 --> 07:59.708
Yes, sir.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.291
-Whoa, got a death wish?

08:10.875 --> 08:11.708
What?

08:12.708 --> 08:16.208
-No, I'm jet lagged, man.
-Right. How was Vienna?

08:17.125 --> 08:20.916
Not supposed to advertise your covert
travel destination on your clothes.

08:22.875 --> 08:26.416
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Depends on what it is.

08:27.458 --> 08:28.833
What--? Why are you--?

08:29.375 --> 08:31.416
Oh, man, wha--? Hey, man--

08:31.958 --> 08:32.958
Can you--?

08:33.041 --> 08:36.791
-We can talk through the window.
-I've had a long day. Days.

08:38.416 --> 08:39.750
Okay. Go ahead.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.833
-It's cold.
-Don't touch my car.

08:42.916 --> 08:45.458
Keep your hands where I can see them.
I don't want a bug in my car.

08:45.541 --> 08:48.166
-That's what I wanna ask you about.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.916
I mean, I am feeling,
like, super paranoid,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.833
which is an honest reaction
to what's going on...

08:54.541 --> 08:55.791
but am I taking it too far?

08:55.875 --> 08:59.041
Look, man. Nothing's ever
what it seems at the agency.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.833
All right? Everybody's out to get you.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.041
Yeah. Like you and Violet.

09:04.583 --> 09:07.250
Man. Don't take it personally.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.708
If it hurts your feelings,
you're in the wrong line of work.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.541
Would anyone at the agency try to kill me?

09:13.625 --> 09:14.500
Sure.

09:15.291 --> 09:19.000
Not on U.S. soil. Too much paperwork,
but that doesn't mean you can relax.

09:19.083 --> 09:22.458
The CIA can search your house
at any moment for any reason.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.708
Now, get out of my car.
You smell like a swamp.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.166
You look ridiculous.

09:58.291 --> 10:01.000
Oh, you're home.
Why are you holding the chair?

10:01.500 --> 10:04.500
-There's been a break-in, man.
-What? Where?

10:04.583 --> 10:07.083
Here. It looks like
they searched the apartment.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.000
What?

10:08.500 --> 10:12.208
No, it looks like a Thursday morning
after an unsanctioned Twister party.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.125
You had fun.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.791
If this is some passive-aggressive way
of you complaining about us being messy,

10:16.875 --> 10:18.375
clean up your own shit.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.833
I found a bowl of cereal
in your room from Easter.

10:20.916 --> 10:22.416
Why were you in my room?

10:22.500 --> 10:24.958
You borrowed my vitamin C serum
and never gave it back.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.250
That stuff is pretty good.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.000
-I know.
-How was Vienna?

10:28.083 --> 10:29.208
How would I know?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.750
We really need to do a better job
of keeping the place clean.

10:33.833 --> 10:34.666
-We?
-Yeah.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.458
You haven't done
anything on the chore chart

10:37.541 --> 10:39.250
since you went to work at the agency.

10:39.333 --> 10:42.041
Shit. I gotta take care
of this subpoena today.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.375
Yeah. No shit.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.958
-I know Sarah, BTW.
-BT-who?

10:47.041 --> 10:51.833
Sarah Okonjo, Senator Smoot's staffer.
She's the contact name on your subpoena.

10:51.916 --> 10:53.041
We escape room together.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.250
Girl drinks like a fish,

10:54.333 --> 10:57.958
which is an expression I've never
understood because fish don't drink water.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.041
They breathe it.

10:59.125 --> 10:59.958
What is water?

11:00.458 --> 11:03.166
-It's time to hit the dry cleaners.
-No, it's--

11:04.041 --> 11:06.250
I put four suits on my credit card
two weeks ago.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.833
The first two were KIA by day eight.
Third one is looking a little rough.

11:10.916 --> 11:14.416
But! I think I'll be able to fix it
with a needle and thread.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.333
-And a time machine.
-Hannah!

11:17.416 --> 11:19.750
Hannah, do you have a sewing kit?

11:19.833 --> 11:22.458
Why do you think I have a sewing kit?
Because I'm a girl?

11:23.458 --> 11:24.291
Yes.

11:26.875 --> 11:30.875
-Fine. But I want it back.
-Thank you! You're my favorite. You.

11:30.958 --> 11:34.541
How do you feel about texting Sarah
and seeing if she wants to go out tonight?

11:34.625 --> 11:35.458
Why?

11:35.541 --> 11:39.333
Well, I may tag along,
charm her into helping me nix my subpoena.

11:39.416 --> 11:41.083
You're not that charming.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.708
Is that why you spent nakey time
with me at Georgetown?

11:43.791 --> 11:46.375
That was before I saw
through all your bullshit.

11:46.458 --> 11:47.500
Ooh. Have you though?

11:48.666 --> 11:49.875
<i>Owen is losing it.</i>

11:50.625 --> 11:52.458
Good. Why?

11:53.458 --> 11:56.250
Saw him this morning.
Looked like shit. Paranoid AF.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.125
Did something happen in Vienna?
What'd your sources say?

12:00.208 --> 12:02.666
Rumor is he met with Xander Goi.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.750
Senior case officer,
thinks he's too good for fieldwork.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.583
Has this weird pastry fetish.

12:09.666 --> 12:11.291
You mean, he has sex with them?

12:11.375 --> 12:13.625
-No, he just eats a lot of pastries.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.166
Kitchens.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.125
Tracy. Hey.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.875
No, I haven't had a chance to talk to him.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.041
Yeah, well, he's in Beirut.

12:25.833 --> 12:26.666
Oh, I will.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.416
That would be a mistake.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.916
Okay? Just give me a little more time.
Nope. Tracy.

12:34.625 --> 12:37.250
I promise I'm gonna take care of this.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.291
Tracy. Tr-- Shit.

12:41.000 --> 12:41.916
Hmm.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.750
Do I wanna know?

12:44.583 --> 12:48.708
Special activities nutjob I use
is going through a messy divorce.

12:48.791 --> 12:49.666
His wife called me,

12:49.750 --> 12:53.375
threatened to air out his dirty laundry
if I didn't get him to pay child support.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.833
-You haven't done it?
-I'm working on it.

12:55.916 --> 12:57.541
Okay, the guy's in Lebanon.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.875
You're scared of him.

12:59.958 --> 13:04.041
No, I'm sensitive to
his biblical capacity for violence.

13:04.125 --> 13:08.500
You better cowboy up before you see
how much violence Nyland is capable of.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.750
-<i>American Embassy.</i>
-Morning.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.875
I work for Owen Hendricks
at the State Department.

13:19.958 --> 13:24.166
He was just there with you, in Vienna.
He left paperwork at the embassy.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.166
Could you direct me to whom he met with?

13:26.250 --> 13:28.916
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I can't give out that information.</i>

13:29.458 --> 13:31.250
<i>You'll have to go through</i>
<i>the proper channels.</i>

13:31.333 --> 13:32.666
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

13:39.791 --> 13:41.583
Meladze, time for court.

13:48.791 --> 13:53.041
-What's the CIA's interest in Meladze?
-National security considerations.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.333
That's what Amelia said.
I need more specifics.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.541
I am not authorized
to give you any of them.

13:57.625 --> 14:00.333
You guys always look so smug
when you say that.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.166
Hey, hey.

14:04.250 --> 14:08.208
Kelly. Owen, from the motel.
We sacrificed chicken nuggets together.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.625
-Oh, yeah. Hi.
-What are you doing here?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.125
-I told you, family drama.
-Family courts are across the street.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.833
-You have to--
-No. My father was murdered.

14:17.666 --> 14:19.875
I just got notified
about some emergency hearing.

14:19.958 --> 14:22.333
Do you know what courtroom
the hearing's in?

14:22.416 --> 14:23.250
This one.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.625
That bitch killed my dad.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.083
I'm so sorry.

14:33.875 --> 14:38.500
-That's not your case, is it?
-No. I'm just filing a motion upstairs.

14:39.333 --> 14:41.708
-Okay, I have to go in.
-Yeah, of course.

14:44.833 --> 14:49.333
All right, let's get started.
<i>State of Arizona v. Maxine Meladze.</i>

14:49.416 --> 14:51.083
A'Nyah Bell for the government.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.875
We filed a transfer memo,
which the state has signed off on.

14:53.958 --> 14:56.083
-What is going on?
-Ma'am. Don't interrupt.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.291
She murdered my dad.
Why isn't she on trial?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.250
Young lady!

14:59.333 --> 15:03.500
I'm sorry for your loss. But I will not
tolerate your interruption or language.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.666
The Attorney General's office asked
to take Miss Meladze's prosecution

15:08.750 --> 15:10.416
as part of a larger federal case.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.083
I'm granting that request.

15:12.791 --> 15:15.333
I assume the government
is arguing against bail.

15:15.416 --> 15:18.333
Yes, we agree with the state
that Miss Meladze is a flight risk

15:18.416 --> 15:20.791
based on her history
and the severity of her crime.

15:20.875 --> 15:21.791
Motion granted.

15:22.541 --> 15:25.541
Marshals will remand Miss Meladze
to FCI while she awaits trial.

15:29.833 --> 15:33.208
Sorry for your loss, <i>malyshka,</i>
but your father was a piece of shit.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.875
Fucking bitch!

15:34.958 --> 15:36.750
-Hey!
-Get off of me!

15:36.833 --> 15:37.666
Miss!

15:38.750 --> 15:40.208
-Calm down.
-Enough.

15:40.291 --> 15:43.000
You need to stay calm.
Ma'am, please. Please.

15:49.666 --> 15:52.291
Hi. I need a minute with your prisoner.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.375
-You kept your word.
-Mm-hm.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.833
What did you say
to the girl in the courtroom?

16:01.666 --> 16:03.583
-Why do you care?
-Oh, I don't.

16:03.666 --> 16:07.250
But you're threatening an automatic
release of secrets if you get killed.

16:07.333 --> 16:10.000
So, maybe don't go provoking
the grieving daughter.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.541
-I need $500 in my commissary account.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.166
-Mm.
-Burner phones aren't cheap,

16:17.250 --> 16:19.166
and you need to be able
to get ahold of me.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.083
Forget it.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.208
I only have $300 left
in my travel per diem.

16:24.291 --> 16:25.791
Three hundred is perfect.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.375
After all, I'm not gonna be here
for very long, right?

16:28.458 --> 16:29.708
No. No, you're not.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.083
This is no way to live.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.416
Well, you're a survivor.
You'll get through it.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.208
She's all yours.

16:42.708 --> 16:43.541
<i>Amelia.</i>

16:44.458 --> 16:47.833
-So, how's it going with Owen?
-We haven't gone out yet.

16:48.666 --> 16:51.416
-It's all good, right?
-Yeah, he's just out of town.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.875
Don't worry.
I know I owe you for the hookup.

16:54.958 --> 16:56.416
Oh, I'm happy to do it.

16:58.291 --> 17:02.333
Okay. I'm just looking for a little dirt.
The kid makes me nervous.

17:02.416 --> 17:07.791
-'Cause you can't bully him?
-No, it's because I don't trust him.

17:07.875 --> 17:11.583
He comes across all charming
and innocent, but I don't buy it.

17:11.666 --> 17:13.083
Well, I pay my debts.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.250
If he tells me something you can
use against him, I'll pass it along.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.791
-Thank you.

17:19.458 --> 17:20.375
Amelia Salazar.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.791
<i>Hey, it's Owen... Hendricks.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:26.125
Oh, hi. Hold on one second.
Sorry, I've gotta take this.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.916
It's a guy from Communications
I've been trying to pin down.

17:29.000 --> 17:29.833
Of course.

17:34.791 --> 17:35.708
Where are you?

17:35.791 --> 17:39.291
Uh, I'm heading back to D.C.
I wanted to call and say thank you.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.375
The feds, they transferred
my case this morning.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.791
-Oh, I'm glad it worked out.
<i>-Me too.</i>

17:44.875 --> 17:49.666
Can I pick your brain about next steps?
How I get the feds to now drop the case?

17:49.750 --> 17:52.083
-I thought we were going for dinner.
<i>-We are.</i>

17:52.166 --> 17:53.166
Great, when?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.541
Tonight? I can do, like, 9.

17:55.625 --> 17:56.958
I'd rather do earlier.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.500
I get up at 5 to run,
so I'm lights out by 10:30.

17:59.583 --> 18:03.166
There's kind of an airplane
involved in me getting to you.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.208
Okay. Nine.
I'll make a reservation at Esprit.

18:06.291 --> 18:09.666
Great. So, about getting
my graymail case thrown out, I--

18:27.958 --> 18:29.583
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.291
I brought fresh sacrifices.

18:31.791 --> 18:34.041
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.000
Very sweet.

18:41.875 --> 18:42.916
So, uh...

18:44.916 --> 18:46.666
Did your dad know that woman?

18:47.416 --> 18:49.791
The one that you said killed him.

18:49.875 --> 18:53.958
The cops claim he was doing criminal shit
with her, but they're wrong.

18:54.041 --> 18:57.541
Drove an 18-wheeler,
barely made enough to pay the mortgage.

18:58.041 --> 19:00.500
She beat his skull in at a truck stop.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.833
Jesus. That's awful.

19:08.958 --> 19:12.875
-But you don't know why she did it?
-Who gives a shit why?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.833
Did you care why your dad was killed?

19:17.125 --> 19:18.750
No, I just wanted him back.

19:34.416 --> 19:37.375
I don't wanna hear a word
about what bunk you want.

19:39.541 --> 19:42.958
I don't give a shit about the bed.
I need a phone.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.875
Who do I talk to?

19:46.083 --> 19:48.291
I'll give you my dessert for a month.

19:49.958 --> 19:51.375
Talk to Cora over there.

19:53.708 --> 19:54.541
The blond one.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.333
So, it's only a safe house
if you follow the rules.

20:01.416 --> 20:02.375
Your bedroom.

20:03.875 --> 20:07.458
You don't go outside.
You don't tell anyone you're here.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.625
You don't open the curtains.
You don't order takeout.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.291
You don't get comfortable.

20:13.083 --> 20:17.083
Treat it like a prison cell.
And whoever's after you won't find you.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.166
It's the FBI.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.791
I don't need to know that, or your name.

20:20.875 --> 20:21.708
It's Cora.

20:22.208 --> 20:26.000
So, if I can't order food or go outside,
how do I eat?

20:26.083 --> 20:29.416
Your fee covers two weeks of food
and your accommodation.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.083
After that, you're back on the street,
and I wipe all trace of you being here.

20:33.166 --> 20:36.583
<i>Nyet.</i> We are not going
to hang out or be friends.

20:37.166 --> 20:38.500
That's what you think.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.750
Treat it like a prison cell.

20:49.500 --> 20:54.875
I need a phone. It needs to have an
international plan and a ton of minutes.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.375
Excuse us.

21:02.666 --> 21:06.500
Really? That's how you come to me
after what you did?

21:07.125 --> 21:08.500
I did what I had to do.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.416
You're the reason I'm in here.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.791
I'm the reason you're alive.

21:12.916 --> 21:15.125
You gonna give me that phone or what?

21:19.083 --> 21:20.833
-Three fifty.
-Three hundred.

21:21.583 --> 21:22.583
Pay at the store.

21:25.750 --> 21:29.458
Okay. I'll take your money,
but we're not friends.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.000
We never were.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.916
-Wow. You look amazing.
-Thanks.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.166
-You look like you're dressed for work.
-I didn't have time to change.

21:51.250 --> 21:54.750
Well, I need sexier
for our first date, so come in.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.833
I've got something you can wear.

22:00.333 --> 22:01.166
All right.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.208
Nice digs.

22:12.041 --> 22:15.333
-Yeah. You got a story, huh?
-Go change in the bathroom.

22:16.291 --> 22:19.750
You know, some guys would
be turned off by your directness.

22:20.958 --> 22:22.750
-Are you?
-No.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.791
No, I like a woman
who knows what she wants.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.750
-Good answer.
-<i>Thank you.</i>

22:28.250 --> 22:29.125
Uh...

22:30.625 --> 22:32.916
Oh, no, it's not that room.
It's not that one.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.666
Oh. What's this?

22:36.041 --> 22:40.416
My future. In three years, I'm gonna
be a talking head on cable news.

22:41.333 --> 22:43.750
I joined the CIA
because National Security credentials

22:43.833 --> 22:46.166
get you paid much more
than being a legal analyst.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.083
Cool. You'd be great at it.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.541
I practice every night.

22:50.958 --> 22:53.916
-Good for you. I'm gonna go change.
-Mm.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.333
<i>I'm just here to collect</i>
<i>for the second week.</i>

23:19.708 --> 23:23.500
Got your money over here.
You wanna stay for dinner?

23:23.583 --> 23:26.958
I'm making some fancy white-trash food.

23:27.041 --> 23:31.291
You haven't lived until you've tasted
my hot dog mac and cheese.

23:31.375 --> 23:32.916
No. Thank you.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.208
Come on.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.208
You're the first person I've talked to

23:37.291 --> 23:39.791
since you were
the last person I talked to,

23:39.875 --> 23:44.541
and something tells me
you don't have other plans.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.500
I thought I'd only be here for six months.

23:49.583 --> 23:53.583
How bad can it be?
America sells itself as a wonderland.

23:54.625 --> 23:56.833
Truth is everyone here is struggling.

23:57.375 --> 23:59.500
And all the food tastes like sugar.

24:00.583 --> 24:03.000
If you hate it so much,
why don't you go home?

24:03.958 --> 24:04.833
Mm.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.666
'Cause you can't.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.125
It's complicated.

24:10.791 --> 24:14.750
When's the last time you sat at a table
and had dinner with someone?

24:15.541 --> 24:19.250
I can't remember.
Honestly, I thought I would enjoy it more.

24:21.958 --> 24:23.708
I've been accused of a lot of things,

24:23.791 --> 24:25.791
but being bad company
has never one of them.

24:26.708 --> 24:28.375
So, to going home.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.375
How drunk do I need to get you
before you'll help me dye my hair?

24:47.250 --> 24:50.416
You know, my daughter
used to ask me to dye her hair.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.166
All the time, she would beg me.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.625
One week pink, next week blue.

24:56.208 --> 25:00.583
And then, I would finally say yes,
and she would complain about everything.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.458
My hands were too rough.
The water was too hot.

25:03.541 --> 25:05.000
Well, she was lucky.

25:05.083 --> 25:08.916
My mom barely bathed us.
I'd have killed to have you for a mother.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.166
I don't know if you would say that
if you knew what happened to her.

25:17.958 --> 25:23.208
Is there any chance
I can get an extra week here?

25:23.291 --> 25:27.291
No. The rules are the rules.
It's how we don't get caught.

25:27.375 --> 25:29.083
I could really use the break.

25:35.250 --> 25:36.083
One more week.

25:38.791 --> 25:41.291
So, what's the deal
with Lester and Violet?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.833
-I don't wanna talk about work.
-No, I know.

25:44.916 --> 25:47.583
At a place where every relationship
seems transactional,

25:47.666 --> 25:49.000
they're attached at the hip.

25:49.083 --> 25:51.541
I think they knew each other
before they joined OGC.

25:51.625 --> 25:52.500
Ah.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.208
Will you get the filet,
so I can have a bite?

25:55.291 --> 25:58.000
Yes, if you answer one last work question.

26:00.791 --> 26:03.333
How do I get the feds
to drop a murder case?

26:04.583 --> 26:09.041
Honestly? You'll just have to go
to the top of the Justice Department.

26:09.875 --> 26:13.083
-Even then, it won't be easy lift.
-The Attorney General?

26:13.166 --> 26:14.000
Yes.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.708
-Of the United States? Of America?
-Yes. Yes.

26:16.791 --> 26:17.791
How?

26:18.583 --> 26:23.125
Are you familiar with the method
of exchanging messages known as e-mail?

26:23.208 --> 26:27.250
-Am I saying that right? E-mail?
-I just can't put anything in writing.

26:27.333 --> 26:28.250
God, no.

26:28.333 --> 26:32.000
Tell the AG's office it's priority one.
Someone will reach out.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.833
Thank you. Seriously.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.291
Owen?

26:37.375 --> 26:38.583
Hannah, hi.

26:39.416 --> 26:42.041
What are you wearing? Is that Gucci?

26:42.125 --> 26:44.000
Yeah, looks nice though, right?

26:44.083 --> 26:47.791
This is Amelia Salazar. We work together.
Hannah's my roommate.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.000
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.250
This is Jeff Gilbert.

26:53.333 --> 26:57.125
Hi, Jeff Gilbert.
I work at the White House.

26:57.708 --> 26:58.708
Good for you.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.500
Okay, well, enjoy your dinner.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.000
-You too.
-Mm.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.833
-She's pretty. How long did you two date?
-Mm-hm.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.875
-Six months. How did you know?
-It's obvious.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.791
-Now you're roommates.
-Yeah. I know it's weird.

27:19.875 --> 27:22.333
Most exes couldn't handle it. We're good.

27:23.916 --> 27:27.458
Owen, I don't care
what you do on your own time,

27:28.166 --> 27:30.583
but when you're with me,
I expect you to focus.

27:30.666 --> 27:31.666
Absolutely.

27:33.083 --> 27:34.000
I'm all yours.

27:36.500 --> 27:37.333
Thanks, man.

27:38.458 --> 27:42.000
That was great. It's been a while
since I've had a vegetable.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.500
-You can kiss me if you like.
-Thank you.

27:52.291 --> 27:53.333
Not bad.

27:54.416 --> 27:55.250
Back at you.

27:56.250 --> 27:59.750
You can come in when we get home,
but we're not having sex.

28:00.250 --> 28:03.625
Actually, I have to meet someone at a bar.
You wanna come?

28:04.958 --> 28:06.541
-You double-booked?
-Wh--?

28:07.208 --> 28:11.041
You said that you'd be in bed by 10:30.
But I can still drive you home.

28:11.833 --> 28:14.833
Never mind, I'll get a car.
Thanks for dinner!

28:15.458 --> 28:16.291
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.666
-She seems nice.
-Yeah.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.250
-Older.
-Mm-hm.

28:23.875 --> 28:28.416
I gotta meet Terence at a bar right now.
You wanna come with?

28:30.291 --> 28:34.833
No. I have to wake up early,
but Jeff will just drive me home.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.750
All right. Have a good night.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.416
-You too.
-Thanks.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.458
Thank you for waiting.

28:48.416 --> 28:49.500
Drive safe, buddy.

29:05.416 --> 29:06.833
Owen! Hey.

29:07.625 --> 29:10.208
-What are you wearing? Is that Gucci?
-Yes.

29:10.291 --> 29:13.416
-Man, you look great.
-Thank you! I was on a date.

29:13.500 --> 29:16.208
No shit. Hannah texted me
12 times from the restaurant.

29:16.291 --> 29:20.583
Did she? Who's that guy that she's seeing?
Is it serious? No.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.708
Ah, no, we are not getting
in the middle of that.

29:22.791 --> 29:25.125
-Okay.
-I told her the exact same thing.

29:25.208 --> 29:28.291
Can I have four shots of tequila, please?
Terence.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.916
-Mm-hm?
-We are doing tequila shots.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I would love to introduce you
to my roommate, Owen.

29:34.083 --> 29:36.208
We know each other from The Hill.

29:36.291 --> 29:39.916
Fuck, no. I am here to party,
not talk about your subpoena.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.291
Me too. I need to know
what I can do to make it go away.

29:43.791 --> 29:46.791
Give Smoot dirt on your boss,
enough to destroy him.

29:46.875 --> 29:49.041
-I don't have any.
-Then, get some.

29:49.125 --> 29:54.083
Otherwise, you show up at a Senate hearing
where my boss will vivisect you on C-SPAN.

29:54.166 --> 29:56.000
Even worse, you'll have to hand over

29:56.083 --> 29:59.250
work product on everything you're doing
that requires classification.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.541
-Everything?
-Everything.

30:04.208 --> 30:07.875
If there's any case you're working
that is even remotely shady,

30:07.958 --> 30:11.333
we'll turn it into a five-alarm fire
and shove it up your ass on live TV.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.166
Wow, grandiose.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.083
Mm.

30:17.833 --> 30:18.916
This is my jam!

30:25.125 --> 30:26.625
-Hello?
-<i>Where are you?</i>

30:27.750 --> 30:30.416
Um, sorry. I'm out, sir.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.083
<i>Get in here. I need you to go to Beirut.</i>

30:33.833 --> 30:36.416
Did you say Beirut as in Lebanon, sir?

30:37.333 --> 30:38.166
Sir?

30:45.458 --> 30:46.666
Brought vodka.

30:47.416 --> 30:48.916
The good stuff this time.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.500
Hey, it's not a good time.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.916
-What happened to your eye?
-She likes it rough.

30:56.125 --> 30:57.375
Oh. Thanks for the booze.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.666
-Who the fuck are you?
-Relax, honey.

31:00.291 --> 31:01.708
I'm a friend of Cora's.

31:02.666 --> 31:05.375
-You should party with us.
-I said no visitors.

31:05.458 --> 31:07.500
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry.

31:07.583 --> 31:10.000
Don't apologize
to the fucking landlady.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.041
None of her business.

31:12.833 --> 31:15.291
Pack your shit, both of you, and get out.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.500
I'll be back in an hour
with a shotgun and a shovel.

31:18.583 --> 31:19.666
Don't be here.

31:44.833 --> 31:45.666
Cora.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.083
Cora.

31:47.666 --> 31:49.333
Cora, what did he do to you?

31:50.750 --> 31:51.875
I'm sorry.

31:59.541 --> 32:01.416
No police.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.916
No, I have to.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.416
You'll die if I don't.

32:18.000 --> 32:18.833
<i>Hello.</i>

32:18.916 --> 32:21.875
The agency's sending me to Beirut.
Because of you?

32:21.958 --> 32:25.583
I can't imagine. I've been to Beirut
but never operationally.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.541
<i>It'd be really easy to kill you there.</i>

32:28.625 --> 32:30.166
That's what I'm afraid of.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.416
<i>If you give me Vienna guy's name,</i>

32:32.500 --> 32:35.000
<i>I can give you the key</i>
<i>to surviving Beirut.</i>

32:35.083 --> 32:35.916
<i>You're not funny.</i>

32:36.000 --> 32:38.291
You're not Russian.
They think I'm hysterical.

32:38.375 --> 32:43.000
Forget it. Telling you an officer's name
violates nine national security rules.

32:43.083 --> 32:45.250
<i>Owen, I am trying to keep you alive,</i>

32:45.333 --> 32:48.041
<i>and you are concerned</i>
<i>about national security.</i>

32:48.125 --> 32:49.958
<i>You need to get your shit together.</i>

32:50.041 --> 32:52.791
There are people at the agency
I have dirt on.

32:52.875 --> 32:56.291
One tried to kill you, and you won't
even tell me what they look like.

33:03.833 --> 33:07.291
He's Asian American,
about 5'10", kind of fussy.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.333
<i>-You know who I'm talking about?</i>
-I do.

33:11.041 --> 33:15.000
-I called him Pastry King.
<i>-Is he a guy that you have dirt on?</i>

33:15.083 --> 33:16.166
So much dirt.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.958
Okay, we'll talk about that
next time I see you.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.541
Now tell me how to navigate Lebanon.

33:22.625 --> 33:23.625
<i>Okay, simple.</i>

33:24.250 --> 33:28.208
The Lebanese people are lovely.
Steer clear of the Americans.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.125
Told you I was funny.

33:32.958 --> 33:35.208
You tried to protect your buddy,
and it backfired.

33:35.291 --> 33:39.000
Sir, that's not true. All right?
I simply misread the situation.

33:39.625 --> 33:42.458
-What's going on?
-Lester dropped an easy pop-up.

33:43.916 --> 33:45.875
Ex-wife of a snake-eater

33:45.958 --> 33:49.458
threatening to expose classified ops
her husband ran for us.

33:49.541 --> 33:52.333
We need to get him to pay child support
in the next 24 hours

33:52.416 --> 33:53.875
or she's going to CNN.

33:54.583 --> 33:56.041
Where are you with the graymail case?

33:56.125 --> 33:58.208
I need help from the AG.
I plan to reach out.

33:58.291 --> 34:02.125
That'll take a few days. He's in Aspen.
So, you're going with Lester to Lebanon.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.333
-Make sure this gets done.
-Yes, sir.

34:05.916 --> 34:08.291
To be clear, we're being sent to Lebanon

34:08.375 --> 34:11.041
to make sure a deadbeat dad
pays child support

34:11.125 --> 34:13.625
so his ex-wife
doesn't graymail the agency?

34:13.708 --> 34:15.750
-That's what I said.
-Right.

34:15.833 --> 34:18.833
This is the first uncomplicated thing
since I started working here,

34:18.916 --> 34:20.500
and it, well, feels good.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.750
There is nothing uncomplicated
about trying to get a man

34:23.833 --> 34:26.875
who murders people for a living
to do something he doesn't wanna do.

34:26.958 --> 34:28.625
Don't take his word for it.

34:28.708 --> 34:31.041
Get a signature on a form
garnishing his wages.

34:31.125 --> 34:35.166
Sir, I can do this. I don't need Owen.

34:35.250 --> 34:38.833
Clearly you do.
Otherwise, this would already be handled.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.541
-You're mad.
-No shit.

34:47.625 --> 34:51.208
I got nine years as a case officer
and six more months as a lawyer than you.

34:51.291 --> 34:53.000
But Nyland sends you to supervise me

34:53.083 --> 34:55.375
because he thinks
humiliation teaches me a lesson?

34:55.458 --> 34:58.250
I'm going to back you up.
It's still your case.

34:58.333 --> 35:00.958
Can I get away with packing just one suit?

35:01.041 --> 35:02.541
Honestly, it's all I got.

35:02.625 --> 35:04.875
You don't need a suit.
Who wears one in the field?

35:04.958 --> 35:07.291
Wow.
I wish you would've told me a week ago.

35:07.375 --> 35:09.791
We need to stop at my apartment
so I can change.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.750
No time. Where's your go bag?

35:11.833 --> 35:13.208
-What?
-Gotta have a go bag.

35:13.291 --> 35:16.625
You can steal one from Janus' office.
He doesn't go to the field anymore.

35:16.708 --> 35:18.541
You're dress like an Armenian vampire.

35:20.458 --> 35:23.958
This should be straightforward, right?
We have the leverage.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.541
Yeah, but he got all the weaponry

35:25.625 --> 35:28.083
and a team who would follow him to hell.

35:36.666 --> 35:39.541
You asked if anybody
at the agency would try to kill you.

35:39.625 --> 35:42.250
Dave's the hitter
they'd call to get it done.

35:43.875 --> 35:47.208
You ever work
with a case officer named Xander Goi?

35:48.500 --> 35:50.375
No, but I met him. Why?

35:51.250 --> 35:54.833
Scale from one to ten,
how duplicitous is this guy?

35:55.875 --> 35:58.750
First off, at the CIA,
the scale starts at six.

35:59.541 --> 36:02.833
I'd say this guy's a eight
based on how ambitious he is.

36:02.916 --> 36:05.583
Word is he's got his eye
on Moscow station,

36:05.666 --> 36:09.000
which is like the holy grail
of intelligence assignments,

36:09.083 --> 36:12.500
but one blemish on your record,
and kiss that post goodbye.

36:13.416 --> 36:15.375
He connect to your graymail case?

36:15.458 --> 36:18.041
Maybe. He has history with the asset.

36:20.208 --> 36:22.750
That's just the kind of thing
that could torpedo him.

36:25.666 --> 36:29.541
What's the plan when we land?
We rent a car and go to the base?

36:29.625 --> 36:32.291
We ain't renting a car.
We get a local driver.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.500
The only way we getting up there
in one piece.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.416
Got it.

36:48.750 --> 36:52.458
I can feel the history here.
You spend a lot of time in Beirut?

36:52.541 --> 36:54.166
-Two years.
-What?

36:55.416 --> 36:59.250
-What's your take on the place?
-I fucking love Beirut.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.083
Every reporter and spy in the Middle East
wants to be posted here.

37:03.166 --> 37:04.625
Ski after breakfast.

37:04.708 --> 37:08.250
Swim in the Mediterranean for lunch,
and do not skip lunch.

37:08.333 --> 37:12.958
Four courses honed over 5,000 years
of grandma's cooking. It is delicious.

37:13.041 --> 37:17.666
Wash that down with mountain moonshine.
Siesta under grapevines? Come on, baby.

37:18.250 --> 37:19.833
And there's the nightlife.

37:19.916 --> 37:24.125
Man, every rich kid from London
to Dubai comes to party in Beirut,

37:24.208 --> 37:26.208
even when shit's hitting the fan.

37:26.750 --> 37:30.166
Nobody does live and let live
like the Lebanese. No, man.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.333
They are coping connoisseurs.

37:32.416 --> 37:36.125
They have to be with the rampant
corruption and dysfunction in this place.

37:36.208 --> 37:38.833
The average Lebanese
will give you his shirt off his back,

37:38.916 --> 37:42.083
while the leaders, no,
they just steal all the shirts.

37:42.791 --> 37:46.250
No, Beirut is a beautiful,
infuriating contradiction.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.666
And no, there are no camels.

38:02.833 --> 38:05.625
Got Farid's number,
so we can call in the morning.

38:05.708 --> 38:07.791
What do you wanna do now?
Get some food, walk?

38:07.875 --> 38:09.458
No, we get rest.

38:09.541 --> 38:12.375
We'll need all the energy we can get
to confront Dave tomorrow.

38:12.458 --> 38:16.625
-Deadbeat Dave doesn't know we're coming?
-I told Beirut station to keep this quiet.

38:16.708 --> 38:19.875
Last thing we wanna do is give
this animal time to get on top of us.

38:19.958 --> 38:22.541
And that's why you always
check the toilet before you sit.

38:28.791 --> 38:29.625
Um...

38:30.041 --> 38:30.958
Lester!

38:31.916 --> 38:33.500
Buddy, it's been too long.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.250
Yeah. Yeah, it has.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.583
-How the fuck are you?
-Good.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.375
-Really good.
-Look, sorry if we spooked you.

38:43.458 --> 38:46.250
When we were heard
our pal Kitchens was in town,

38:46.333 --> 38:47.958
we wanted to surprise you.

38:48.041 --> 38:51.458
And FYI, the amenities
in this hotel are choice,

38:51.541 --> 38:53.791
but anything beats
shitting out of a helicopter.

38:53.875 --> 38:56.041
Actually, that sounds fun to me.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.000
Who the fuck are you?

39:04.916 --> 39:07.625
I'm kidding. Owen, right?

39:08.208 --> 39:11.291
-Owen Hendricks, the new kid?
-New-ish. Not a kid.

39:12.375 --> 39:13.833
Listen, Lester,

39:13.916 --> 39:18.791
buddy, I hate that you flew all this way
out of Tracy's misunderstanding.

39:18.875 --> 39:20.583
She called my boss, Dave.

39:21.458 --> 39:24.250
You know how T-Pain gets,
always with the drama.

39:24.333 --> 39:28.250
-You told me you would handle this.
-I swear I mailed those checks.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.333
She's threatening to release
state secrets you shared with her.

39:31.416 --> 39:32.250
Okay.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.125
Okay, that's on me.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.958
Here, you can put this on the record.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.958
I fully acknowledge the errors of my ways.

39:40.041 --> 39:43.375
-I do. I really, really do.
-That's great. Great.

39:43.458 --> 39:44.750
Then you can just

39:44.833 --> 39:47.333
sign this form that states you,
the debtor,

39:47.416 --> 39:49.416
agree to have your wages garnished

39:49.500 --> 39:53.583
to pay the child support
that's owed to the creditor, your ex-wife.

39:53.666 --> 39:56.000
Then we can all go back to our lives.

39:58.666 --> 39:59.500
No problem.

40:02.625 --> 40:03.458
Really?

40:04.500 --> 40:07.250
Yeah, I'll just take it back to the base,

40:07.875 --> 40:10.666
read it, have it signed, sealed,
and delivered in the morning.

40:10.750 --> 40:13.250
-And we appreciate that.
-Yeah, absolutely.

40:15.125 --> 40:18.875
Hey, boys, let's bug out,
let the lawyers settle in.

40:23.125 --> 40:23.958
Nice pillow.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.208
It was good to see you again, boss.

40:28.916 --> 40:30.541
Keep your head on a swivel.

40:31.125 --> 40:34.500
This place has gotten <i>beaucoup </i>dangerous
since the last time you were here.

40:35.458 --> 40:39.708
Militias are feisty. Wouldn't want
anything bad to happen to you.

40:45.916 --> 40:48.250
-I feel like that was too easy.

40:48.333 --> 40:49.375
Too easy, right?

40:49.458 --> 40:50.875
I need a drink.

40:52.416 --> 40:55.166
I thought getting out of the field
would make my life less stressful.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.083
Huh.

40:56.958 --> 41:00.791
That's why you made the jump to
the Office of the General Counsel?

41:00.875 --> 41:02.291
That was Violet's fault.

41:03.125 --> 41:05.458
I met her at this Army base in Germany.

41:05.541 --> 41:09.166
She was there as a JAG,
and she was tired of the Army.

41:09.250 --> 41:14.250
Convinced me that being a lawyer was
the only transferable skill in the CIA,

41:14.333 --> 41:16.250
so she helped me with law school online.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.416
I taught her how the agency works.

41:18.500 --> 41:22.291
Here I am, back at the bottom,
being babysat by some golden boy.

41:23.750 --> 41:24.708
That's not fair.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.875
First week on the job,
Nyland's already got you at the Senate.

41:28.958 --> 41:32.041
Then you hit pay dirt with this graymail.
What would you call it?

41:32.125 --> 41:34.791
I'd like to think I'm good at what I do.

41:34.875 --> 41:40.125
Man, you don't even know what you do.
Okay? What you are is lucky.

41:40.958 --> 41:43.958
If you knew anything about my life,
you wouldn't call me lucky.

41:44.041 --> 41:48.791
But by all means, keep underestimating me.
See how far that gets you.

42:02.250 --> 42:05.458
-Uh-uh. That one's mine.
-What is the difference?

42:05.541 --> 42:07.791
The difference is
mine's furthest from the door.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.083
Uh, Lester?

42:22.166 --> 42:25.916
Don't worry about it.
Happens sometimes. Generator will kick on.

42:31.666 --> 42:32.750
Lester.

42:34.875 --> 42:36.583
There's someone at the door.

42:37.833 --> 42:38.791
Uh-huh.

42:41.541 --> 42:42.958
What do we do?

42:44.583 --> 42:47.708
-See who it is.
-Why me? What do I have to go do it?

42:48.291 --> 42:50.750
-You're closer to the door.
-Are you f--?

42:55.416 --> 42:56.250
Fine.

43:13.583 --> 43:14.500
What is it?

43:14.583 --> 43:15.791
It's Dave's form.

43:18.291 --> 43:19.125
He sign it?

43:21.208 --> 43:22.041
Nope.

43:41.666 --> 43:42.625
Oh.

43:43.416 --> 43:44.500
Mm.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.166
Fresh from the factory,

43:46.250 --> 43:49.416
twice the stopping power,
half the kickback.

43:59.166 --> 44:00.083
Whoa.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.541
Morning!

44:02.208 --> 44:06.208
Hey, we really appreciate you
dropping this off last night, but, uh...

44:07.250 --> 44:09.708
we can't leave Lebanon until you sign it.

44:15.583 --> 44:16.541
And if I don't?

44:22.000 --> 44:26.750
Come on. You're a smart guy, Dave.
I'm not just blowing smoke up your woo-ha.

44:26.833 --> 44:29.416
Lester, he's got mad respect for you.

44:29.500 --> 44:35.000
It's why he couldn't give the tough love
that you need, but that's why I'm here.

44:35.083 --> 44:38.166
I'll tell you the truth,
no matter how painful it is.

44:38.250 --> 44:41.958
It's funny. I actually think
that we have a lot in common.

44:42.041 --> 44:43.875
-Mm.
-Not in obvious ways, obviously.

44:44.541 --> 44:46.666
But you and I
both need to know where we stand.

44:46.750 --> 44:49.208
No time for rose-tinted glasses
or best-case scenarios.

44:49.291 --> 44:50.791
So, here's the real.

44:50.875 --> 44:53.500
You don't sign this form,
your life is over.

44:54.083 --> 44:55.791
The CIA will pull you from the field

44:55.875 --> 44:58.666
and prosecute you
for all the illegal shit that you've done.

44:58.750 --> 45:01.208
If you somehow manage to avoid prison,

45:01.291 --> 45:04.791
they are gonna blacklist you
from every potential employer.

45:04.875 --> 45:07.375
Then they'll put you on the no-fly list.

45:07.458 --> 45:10.125
So you can't get a job anywhere else.

45:10.208 --> 45:13.166
But that's not gonna happen, right?

45:13.666 --> 45:16.041
You wouldn't be so stupid
as to abandon your kid,

45:16.125 --> 45:18.875
both emotionally and financially, right?

45:24.583 --> 45:25.833
Give me the damn pen.

45:29.041 --> 45:30.916
We couldn't make another copy.

45:31.666 --> 45:33.916
Security reasons. You understand.

45:43.250 --> 45:45.750
All right. Thank you.

45:48.166 --> 45:49.000
Take care.

45:49.833 --> 45:50.666
Prick.

45:50.750 --> 45:52.416
<i>-As-salamu alaykum.</i>
<i>-As-salamu alaykum.</i>

45:56.291 --> 45:57.208
Guten Morgen.

45:57.291 --> 46:01.208
I'm calling from the American Embassy
about one of our employees.

46:01.291 --> 46:05.250
-He comes there to buy pastries.
-<i>Please hold. We are very busy.</i>

46:42.583 --> 46:45.291
Yeah? No, we're good. I got your money.

46:46.000 --> 46:46.958
-Hey.
-Yeah.

46:48.666 --> 46:50.458
Give me a minute. I'll call you back.

46:51.333 --> 46:53.875
-Can you help me?
-Sure. What's the problem?

46:53.958 --> 46:56.625
My car, it won't start.

46:57.708 --> 47:00.041
Yeah. You're a pretty thing.

47:00.125 --> 47:00.958
Oh, yeah?

47:02.541 --> 47:04.916
-You don't recognize me?
-No.

47:06.416 --> 47:09.125
Oh, wait. You dance at Diamond's, right?

47:09.750 --> 47:12.041
I met you at Cora's,

47:12.125 --> 47:14.708
just before you beat her half to death.

47:18.166 --> 47:20.208
Ain't my fault
that girl can't take a punch.

48:31.125 --> 48:34.416
Yes. I'm calling from the American embassy
about one of our employees.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.750
<i>Ja,</i> Mr. Goi.

48:36.833 --> 48:38.916
<i>He comes in every day, our best customer.</i>

48:39.000 --> 48:43.125
Exactly. I just want to confirm
his first name so there are no mix-ups.

48:43.708 --> 48:45.875
Ja. Ja. <i>Xander Goi.</i>

48:46.916 --> 48:47.958
Perfect.

48:48.625 --> 48:51.291
Oh, hey. I have been
looking all over for you.

48:51.375 --> 48:53.208
-Hey, Purple.
-So, how did the date go?

48:53.291 --> 48:55.666
-Fine.
-And do you got anything for me?

48:55.750 --> 48:58.458
No. He didn't wanna talk about work,
but I'll keep trying.

48:58.541 --> 49:02.083
Hey, yo!
The conquering heroes have returned.

49:02.166 --> 49:05.375
-Come on, <i>as-salamu alaykum.</i>
<i>-As-salamu alaykum </i>to you.

49:05.791 --> 49:09.708
-Oh. Looks like somebody bonded.
-Oh, no big deal. You know.

49:09.791 --> 49:12.041
I got a refill for that mini fridge.

49:12.125 --> 49:14.875
Listen, I wanted to apologize
about the other night.

49:14.958 --> 49:18.083
What I did was not cool.
Let me make it up to you.

49:19.083 --> 49:20.166
You better.

49:20.250 --> 49:22.041
-Hendricks.
-Yes, sir.

49:23.833 --> 49:26.791
Why the fuck is
the Attorney General of the United States

49:26.875 --> 49:28.791
waiting in your fucking office?

49:30.250 --> 49:34.166
It's a priority one e-mail.
Yes, sir. Sorry.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.916
Mr. Attorney General.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.500
When I sent that e-mail,
I never expected you to--

49:42.583 --> 49:47.333
You said priority one.
That means priority-fucking-one.

49:47.416 --> 49:49.125
Yes, sir. I'll keep it brief.

49:49.791 --> 49:52.375
There's a murder suspect
in jail in Arizona.

49:52.458 --> 49:56.541
She's a former foreign asset,
and poses a threat to national security.

49:57.125 --> 49:58.625
I need you to throw the case out.

49:58.708 --> 50:03.750
Did Nyland put you up to this because
I punked him in front of the president?

50:03.833 --> 50:07.833
No. No, sir, this is very real.
I can get you classified materials.

50:07.916 --> 50:09.541
You want me to set free a foreigner

50:09.625 --> 50:12.750
who murdered a U.S. citizen
in a swing state in an election year?

50:12.833 --> 50:16.916
I hadn't thought about it like that, sir,
but the answer is yes.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
You actually think--?

50:18.083 --> 50:21.041
I'm more than happy
to have you yell at me all day,

50:21.125 --> 50:23.750
but the reality of the situation
is that this needs to happen.

50:23.833 --> 50:26.083
If she follows through on her threats,

50:26.166 --> 50:30.041
the agency's ability to collect
information will be crippled.

50:30.125 --> 50:31.916
So, you need to get this done,

50:32.541 --> 50:36.500
sir, before she does something
that we can't fix.

50:41.958 --> 50:44.166
-Guten morgen.
-Guten morgen, Mr. Goi.

50:44.250 --> 50:46.333
A special order was placed for you,

50:46.416 --> 50:49.625
but I don't understand
the note they asked me to write.
