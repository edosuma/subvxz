How I Met Your Father...

00:03.378 --> 00:06.548
I think I've found the man that
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.758
I'm moving to Australia.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.302
- We're married!
- Aaah!

00:11.511 --> 00:12.887
What?

00:12.887 --> 00:16.016
Valentina... I don't want kids.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.475
We broke up.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.185
I moved to New York
to start over,

00:19.185 --> 00:20.520
reconnect with my brother.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.105
- Aaaah!
- Whoo!

00:22.105 --> 00:23.857
- Oh, my God, my brother and I--
- Okay, yeah.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.400
Jesse and I see the world the same way.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.069
And there's been something
between us since the day we met.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.905
We need to break up.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.157
What?

00:32.657 --> 00:34.784
I love you, Sophie.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.412
We don't even know
if this is gonna work out.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.496
Got it.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.582
What did Jesse
do wrong other than

00:40.582 --> 00:43.293
say everything
you ever wanted a guy to say

00:43.293 --> 00:45.628
just faster than you expected?

00:51.801 --> 00:52.719
Hi!

00:52.719 --> 00:53.678
Hi.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.680
Is this a good time?

01:03.521 --> 01:07.108
<i>♪ Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ♪</i>

01:07.108 --> 01:11.154
<i>♪ Ba-ba, da-da-da-da-da-da
da-da-da ♪</i>

01:13.782 --> 01:17.035
SOPHIE'S SON (on phone):
<i>Mom? Mom! Where are you?</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:20.580
<i>If you don't come back in three seconds,
I'm going to hang up!</i>

01:20.580 --> 01:22.332
<i>Three, two...</i>

01:22.332 --> 01:24.793
Calm down! I'm right here!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.879
God, you're, like,
obsessed with my story.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.633
SOPHIE'S SON: <i>You said you'd be right back,
and then you vanished.</i>

01:31.633 --> 01:34.511
<i>It felt like a year.
Wait, did you make food?</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:37.263
Spaghetti pomodoro, yes!

01:38.098 --> 01:40.100
I also took a power nap.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.728
Telling a story
of this breadth is exhausting.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.690
Okay, back to the night
of my first gallery show.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.150
Is this a good time?

01:49.150 --> 01:50.819
 Um...

01:50.819 --> 01:52.028
I'm back in New York.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.655
I see that.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.989
I saw your post
about the show

01:54.989 --> 01:56.366
and I decided
to surprise you.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.451
Surprise!

02:02.705 --> 02:05.458
I hope me showing up
like this is okay.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.295
I mean, I have no idea what's going on
in your life right now. Like...

02:10.421 --> 02:11.464
romantically?

02:12.590 --> 02:16.010
I considered what a hot mess
my last 48 hours were.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.720
<i>The forbidden kisses.</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:19.013
<i>The break-ups.</i>

02:19.013 --> 02:20.223
<i>The hook-ups.</i>

02:20.223 --> 02:22.016
<i>The sleep "I love you's."</i>

02:22.016 --> 02:23.393
<i>The flame-outs.</i>

02:23.393 --> 02:25.019
<i>The betrayals.</i>

02:25.019 --> 02:26.604
<i>The murders.</i>

02:26.604 --> 02:27.981
SOPHIE'S SON:
<i>Wait, what?</i>

02:27.981 --> 02:30.275
I killed a rat
right before my gallery show.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.528
It-it's not related
to my horrible love life.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.196
It was just-- It was--
Well, it was, you know--

02:35.196 --> 02:36.739
It was weighing on me.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.617
Anyway, I was torn.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.203
I mean, his timing,
it was terrible!

02:42.912 --> 02:45.206
But, on the other hand,

02:45.206 --> 02:48.293
I was getting a second shot
with the one that got away.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.795
So, I said...

02:50.962 --> 02:54.549
There is absolutely nothing
going on with me romantically.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.427
Great. Can I buy you
a drink after this?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.220
I'd like that.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.056
Excuse me.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.767
I need to steal the artist
and introduce her

03:05.101 --> 03:06.352
to reality!

03:06.644 --> 03:08.271
- What are you doin'?
- What?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.149
Things with Jesse just ended.
You were really sad about it,

03:11.149 --> 03:12.984
like, five minutes ago.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.903
Are you really ready
to go out with another guy?

03:14.903 --> 03:16.487
I-I-I don't know,

03:16.487 --> 03:18.364
but I've already watched
Ian walk out of my life once.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.949
I'm not gonna let him
get away from me again.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.534
And I know that came out
a little bit stalker-y,

03:21.534 --> 03:23.203
but it doesn't matter
because you know what?

03:23.203 --> 03:26.915
He tracked me down at my show,
so who's the stalker now? Ha!

03:30.418 --> 03:31.377
Hey.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.171
Hey.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.634
So, I wanna hear everything
about your elopement!

03:38.509 --> 03:39.427
Actually...

03:40.678 --> 03:42.680
Congrats.
You're married.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.308
Really? That's it?

03:45.308 --> 03:47.810
You're not even gonna be like,
"Do you, Sid, take Hannah?"

03:47.810 --> 03:49.020
Who's Sid and Hannah?

03:50.605 --> 03:52.440
Who do you think?

03:52.857 --> 03:54.776
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
have to tell that story

03:54.776 --> 03:56.152
for the rest of my life and it--

03:56.152 --> 03:57.111
Sucks.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.404
And every time we tell it,

03:58.404 --> 04:01.241
everyone's mouth's gonna
be like, "aww."

04:01.241 --> 04:03.034
- But their eyes are gonna be like, "ooh."
- Mm!

04:06.037 --> 04:08.665
Oh, it's already happening!
Look at their eyes!

04:10.625 --> 04:11.709
Okay...

04:11.709 --> 04:13.169
Okay, it's still
our wedding day.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.171
Let's just-- Let's just
call all our friends to the bar

04:15.171 --> 04:17.173
and just have <i>the</i> best
wedding party of all time.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.259
And then <i>that</i> will become
our wedding story.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.220
- Mm-hmm.
- Damn! I just got husbanded.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.806
Hey, maybe you two can do,
like, a couple's roast.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.474
That would be funny.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.685
Just don't mention
my Anna Kendrick <i>Cups</i> phase.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.610
We can't do a couple's roast because...

04:38.653 --> 04:39.946
we're not a couple anymore.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.155
Wait, what?

04:41.155 --> 04:44.659
We realized that we want
different things.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.369
So, we're friends now.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.205
Can you guys really just
turn it off like that? You know,

04:49.205 --> 04:51.124
your dynamic is incredibly sexual.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.584
You coined the phrase
"Netflix and..."

05:02.760 --> 05:05.096
Th-that's--
That's all in the past.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.348
- We are just buds now.
- Yep.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.560
Total bros. Hug it out, bro?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.061
Bring it in, bro.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.939
- You're hard, bro.
- Oh.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.026
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.444
I'm here! I'm here! I'm here.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.696
Oh, my God. I raced over
as soon as I saw your text.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.449
Holy shit, man!
You're married?! Wha...

05:24.449 --> 05:26.868
W-what about your wedding
a-and your Indian wedding?

05:26.868 --> 05:29.037
A-and why wasn't I there?
I mean, did you have another best man?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.122
Was he Indian?
It's okay if he was. Like--

05:31.122 --> 05:32.915
- I don't even know why I asked that.
- No.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.251
No best man. We eloped.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.088
- Huh? Huh? Just be happy for us, man!
- I am! I am!

05:39.088 --> 05:40.673
Is that Ian?

05:41.799 --> 05:42.925
Yep.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.511
He just got back to town
and came to surprise me.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.348
That's not a problem, is it?

05:49.515 --> 05:51.559
Nope. Why would it be a problem?

05:51.559 --> 05:53.644
- It wouldn't be.
- Great. So there's no problem then.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.898
There's clearly a problem.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.483
Somebody say what's going on.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.070
Sophie and I decided
that us dating was a bad idea.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.614
Oh, so just friends then.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.407
Word of advice. Don't hug her.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.660
Okay, I don't care who's dating

06:09.660 --> 06:11.996
or who's just friends
or who's hard.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.665
Hannah and I get one wedding day,
and you're our best friends,

06:14.665 --> 06:16.959
so you're all gonna come to the bar,
you're going to act normal,

06:16.959 --> 06:19.003
and you're gonna celebrate
our love, damn it!

06:21.464 --> 06:22.465
There's an open bar.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.762
Hoo-hoo!

06:27.762 --> 06:30.306
Sorry. I was trying
to seamlessly cheer my way in.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.891
I missed the window.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.853
Hey, you know what? About that drink,
uh, my friends just decided

06:35.853 --> 06:38.022
to throw a last-minute wedding party
at their bar, so--

06:38.022 --> 06:40.608
That sounds like fun! I'm in!

06:42.860 --> 06:44.695
<i>Okay! Everybody gets a job.</i>

06:44.695 --> 06:46.697
- Jesse, best man toast.
- Yeah. Woo!

06:46.697 --> 06:50.118
And may I just say that you
chose the <i>best man</i> for the job?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.285
Ha ha ha!

06:51.285 --> 06:52.453
Keep that out of my toast.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.788
Sophie, you're taking photos.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.289
Ooh, I don't have my camera.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.625
Oh, really?
Does your phone not have a camera?

06:57.625 --> 06:58.918
More snapping, less yapping.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.087
Val, Charlie, you're in charge
of the photo montage.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.798
Now, is that clear, or are you
gonna be a Sophie about it?

07:03.798 --> 07:07.343
And, of course, thank you all so much
for attending our special day.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.846
What she said.
Ellen, wedding playlist.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.514
Make sure it has
the Electric Slide.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.725
Dude, no! No, no,
everybody hates the Electric Slide.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.311
Have you not learned your lesson?
Our first week at college,

07:17.311 --> 07:20.398
Sid tried to start
a spontaneous slide on the quad.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.401
- Jesse, I'm doing it.
- No.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.027
<i>♪ It's electric! ♪</i>

07:25.027 --> 07:26.988
Let's slide, people!

07:29.866 --> 07:30.992
Okay!

07:34.954 --> 07:37.290
<i>That</i> guy became
a Wesleyan legend.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.125
They called him "The Stomper."

07:39.500 --> 07:40.960
Come on, guys.
It's our wedding.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.046
I would rather be electric-cuted.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.631
Ice cold.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.259
I respect it.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.055
Why don't you go grab us
some drinks and snag us a table?

07:53.055 --> 07:55.766
- Oh, sure. Uh, what do you-- Oh.
- Just surprise me.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.268
Listen, everyone.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.687
I don't want Ian to know
that I burned through

07:59.687 --> 08:01.689
two different guys
in the past day.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.942
So everyone be cool and chill.
Just like me.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.445
Cool and chill. Yeah?
Let me hear you say it. What am I?

08:08.112 --> 08:08.988
Cool and chill.

08:08.988 --> 08:09.947
Alright, now let's do me.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.617
I am tall and curious.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.257
I don't get it.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.718
You two were so into each other
like a day ago.

08:30.718 --> 08:31.802
What happened?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.472
You're great with
secrets, right?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.933
No. I'm great with <i>sequins</i>.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.147
- Wow, that looks just like you.
- I know!

08:43.147 --> 08:44.857
It only took me
12 Saturday nights to make.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.526
- Only 12?
- Mm-hmm.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.945
- Okay, now dish, fish.
- Alright, but look,

08:48.945 --> 08:50.488
let's just keep this
between us, okay?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.532
I don't wanna add any drama
to Sid and Hannah's big night.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.034
Don't worry.
Hey, I-I'm your sister.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.577
- I'll keep your secret.
- Okay.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.829
- And I know my way around a sister secret.
- Great.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.123
Okay, uh, well, anyway,
last night,

09:01.123 --> 09:03.459
I accidentally told Sophie
that I loved her in my sleep.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.294
- What?
- Then she freaked out and told me that I should

09:05.294 --> 09:06.712
- go on tour with Meredith.
- What?!

09:06.712 --> 09:08.256
So then, I got really upset
and told her to leave,

09:08.256 --> 09:09.966
and then I called Meredith
and invited her over.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.050
- What?!
- I know.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.385
So she showed up,
and all of a sudden,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.637
we're making out,
and I guess I kind of agreed

09:14.637 --> 09:16.389
- to go on tour with her.
- What?

09:17.431 --> 09:20.017
I'm sorry.
I couldn't go any higher, so I went low.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.310
The whole thing's
really confusing.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.603
I mean, I was so into Sophie--

09:22.603 --> 09:24.522
Oh, who cares about
your stupid love life?

09:25.189 --> 09:27.108
You're leaving me to go on tour?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.234
Wait, what?

09:28.526 --> 09:31.070
I moved across the country
to reconnect with you!

09:31.070 --> 09:32.738
And now, you're abandoning me

09:32.738 --> 09:34.699
to go on tour
with your ex-girlfriend?

09:35.866 --> 09:37.368
That is not
gonna trigger

09:37.368 --> 09:39.495
my adopted person
abandonment issues at all!

09:39.495 --> 09:40.997
- Ellen, come on--
- Shh!

09:47.086 --> 09:48.546
Wow.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.089
She really has a gift.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.884
I've got an order for Sad?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.179
It-it's Sid. Thank you.
Thank you for that.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.973
- Hannah?
- Hm?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.808
What wedding would be
complete without a cake?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.144
Okay, now, options were limited,

10:03.144 --> 10:05.479
but I did find a deli
that has your favorite...

10:07.523 --> 10:08.941
What the hell is this?

10:09.358 --> 10:12.403
It's gefilte fish.
My mom serves it on Passover.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.072
It's a traditional Jewish
ground fish loaf.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.908
Hannah, this was supposed
to be red velvet cake!

10:17.908 --> 10:19.702
Not this... nightmare fish!

10:21.454 --> 10:24.081
How do we have
no pictures of Hannah and Sid?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.917
I have a strict
no earnest smiling policy.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.502
Those two have a disease.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.256
I'm proud of us.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.383
For how well we're handling
this breakup

10:34.383 --> 10:37.094
and transitioning
into being bros.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.805
Yeah, me, too.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.724
I think we're being very mature.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.353
- Just... two mature bros.
- Mm-hmm.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.356
Like Ian McKellen
and Patrick Stewart.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.987
I like being your friend.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.740
I think you're easy
to be friends with.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.911
You, too.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.961
And you also.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.344
Yep.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.852
Hey.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.729
Why does your friend
from your photo keep...

11:28.729 --> 11:30.314
staring at us like that?

11:31.565 --> 11:35.361
He looks like an anglerfish
who just saw a crab.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.029
A what?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.699
Man, that line would've killed
back on the boat.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.743
But no, seriously, what is his deal?

11:44.745 --> 11:46.330
Well,

11:46.330 --> 11:48.207
ever since I took that
photo of him,

11:48.207 --> 11:49.667
he's been trying to be a model

11:49.667 --> 11:51.752
and flaunting his looks
harder than a...

11:52.920 --> 11:53.838
angelfish?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.923
Eh?

11:55.923 --> 11:58.384
That's hilarious!
That's hilarious.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.469
Speaking of models,

12:00.469 --> 12:01.554
I'm actually supposed to be

12:01.554 --> 12:02.847
taking pictures of this shindig.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.682
- You wanna grab us another round?
- Sure.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.606
Hey, everyone! Say "Sid and Hannah!"

12:12.606 --> 12:14.316
Yeah.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.861
Stop staring at my date.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.195
You're weirding out Ian.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.864
Sorry, I'm just confused.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.615
I mean, he really came
out of nowhere.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.034
Oh. Is that confusing to you?

12:24.034 --> 12:26.954
Is the concept of a romantic interest
from the past

12:26.954 --> 12:28.914
suddenly reappearing
into someone's life confusing to you?

12:28.914 --> 12:30.791
W-what's that supposed to mean?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.293
D-Did Ellen say something
to you?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.211
You know what?
I can't do this right now, Jesse.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.046
Just stop staring at my date.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.174
I'm not gonna let you
ruin this for me.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.593
There she is!
The woman who broke my heart.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.012
Good to see you, Soph.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.097
I'm gonna let him
ruin it for me.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.353
Drew!

12:52.188 --> 12:53.314
What are you doing here?

12:53.481 --> 12:55.232
Hannah invited me.
You look great, by the way.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.650
I love your shirt made of pogs.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.068
Are those pogs?
Whatever they are,

12:58.068 --> 12:59.904
I love them to death.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.281
Are you okay?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.033
Why wouldn't I be okay?
Because you dumped me?

13:04.033 --> 13:06.619
Or because my dad's
probably going to prison till I'm 50?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.829
Or because I got buzzed alone
on oat milk White Russians

13:08.829 --> 13:10.039
in my apartment earlier today,

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
and then just wandered
aimlessly around Midtown

13:11.916 --> 13:13.542
until I saw a day spa advertising

13:13.542 --> 13:15.669
a "Glow-up Teeth Whitening
and Spray Tan Special"

13:15.669 --> 13:17.880
for $49.99 called
"The Orange Creamsicle,"

13:17.880 --> 13:20.257
and said to myself,
"I deserve that."

13:21.926 --> 13:23.761
Did you get a spray tan?

13:23.761 --> 13:25.971
- It's so natural, I hadn't noticed--
- Ah!

13:26.764 --> 13:28.766
Sorry. Sorry, once in a while,

13:28.766 --> 13:31.227
I-I get these shooting pains
from my two front teeth.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.062
They say it happens
to one in 100 people who go to

13:33.062 --> 13:34.730
New York Upstairs
Whiten and Tan.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.482
Guess I'm one of the lucky ones.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.108
- I think I've got an Advil for you--
- N-no.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.444
It's all good. The receptionist
gave me a couple codeines

13:40.444 --> 13:42.363
in exchange for a kiss.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.951
- Hey. I'm Ian.
- What's up?

13:46.951 --> 13:47.993
I'm Drew.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.120
This is my ex, Sophie.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.166
Don't waste this
fun energy on us, Drew!

13:54.166 --> 13:56.752
- Go congratulate the happy couple!
- Eh, good point.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.839
Hey, if you need me,
just, uh, follow the light.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.925
Ooh, do I smell gefilte fish?

14:05.219 --> 14:07.221
Hey. Look, I know
you're mad at me

14:07.221 --> 14:09.223
or-or whatever,
but it was really screwed up

14:09.223 --> 14:11.350
that you went and told Sophie
our sister secret.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.561
Also, why are we calling it that?
We're not sisters. I'm a boy.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.230
I mean man!
Damn it, I'm a man!

14:17.231 --> 14:18.524
I didn't tell Sophie.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.526
- You didn't?
- No!

14:20.526 --> 14:22.444
But I always love
an exasperated white guy

14:22.444 --> 14:24.530
screaming at me that he's a man!

14:26.031 --> 14:28.033
So thank you for that.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.916
How did she even make that?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.376
So,

14:37.376 --> 14:40.170
when exactly did you
and Drew end things?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.089
Because it seems kind of fresh.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.591
<i>And that's when it happened.</i>

14:46.010 --> 14:47.970
<i>Both of them were hurtling
towards me</i>

14:47.970 --> 14:49.847
<i>at the exact same time.</i>

14:49.847 --> 14:52.725
<i>Like emotional man asteroids,</i>

14:52.725 --> 14:54.894
<i>determined to blow up my spot.</i>

14:54.894 --> 14:58.898
So I did the only thing I could think of
to keep them from talking to me.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.275
Uh, I think it's time for...

15:01.275 --> 15:03.360
Sid and Hannah's first dance!

15:04.570 --> 15:08.073
If everyone could silently stay
exactly where you are right now,

15:08.073 --> 15:11.368
and we're gonna
watch them dance! In silence!

15:12.995 --> 15:14.204
Ellen! Hit it!

15:14.204 --> 15:16.373
Oh, my Bluetooth won't connect.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.958
Doesn't matter.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.210
'Cause I'm gonna sing it live.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.256
Sid, Hannah, what's your song?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.216
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

15:26.216 --> 15:28.469
Oh! Wow. Great.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.764
I'll totally sing that
song that I...

15:31.764 --> 15:33.140

Thank you.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.199
Hey, Sophie, I really need

16:32.199 --> 16:33.534
- to talk to you.
- No! I am on my way out.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.910
- I just need to grab Ian--
- Hey, quick Q.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.370
Was I supposed to
shower off this spray tan?

16:36.370 --> 16:37.705
'Cause I think
I'm still developing--

16:37.705 --> 16:39.081
What did you mean
when you said that thing

16:39.081 --> 16:40.874
about romantic interests
reappearing from the past?

16:40.874 --> 16:41.959
I didn't mean anything.

16:41.959 --> 16:42.960
Yes, you did.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.586
Oh, my skin smells like poison.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.338
- Here, Sophie, smell my arm.
- No!

16:46.588 --> 16:48.966
- Oh, you guys, just excuse me--
- Will you please just tell me what you meant?!

16:48.966 --> 16:52.302
I saw you kissing Meredith
outside of your apartment!

16:54.346 --> 16:55.806
You kissed Meredith?

16:59.643 --> 17:01.478
What... How did you see that?

17:01.478 --> 17:03.063
'Cause I came back.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.692
I was coming back to...

17:08.027 --> 17:08.902
Oh.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.822
Yeah.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.450
One more Q.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.243
Um...

17:16.243 --> 17:17.911
Did you and Jesse get together

17:17.911 --> 17:20.330
in the 24 hours
since you dumped me?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.666
Yes.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.002
Drew, yes. I'm...

17:25.919 --> 17:27.588
I'm so sorry.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.674
I think if I wasn't
on all these painkillers,

17:30.674 --> 17:33.093
I just might be a skosh upset.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.139
- Hey. Is everything alright?
- No.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.516
Ian, it's actually not.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.936
I gotta get some air.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.938
And yes, Drew,
you were supposed to shower off,

17:44.938 --> 17:47.316
and don't kiss people
for codeine!

have been messy for you

18:16.178 --> 18:17.763
while I've been gone.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.640
Yeah.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.185
- About that--
- It doesn't matter.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.877
Sid, I was ready to spend
the rest of my life with her.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.380
Those feelings didn't go away
just 'cause she said no to my proposal.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.048
Okay, but what about Sophie?

18:53.590 --> 18:56.927
Sophie's amazing,
but she's also complicated.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.429
The moment we got together,
she blew it all up.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.849
All I've ever wanted...

19:02.724 --> 19:04.226
was to find love.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.147
And I think, maybe...

19:08.647 --> 19:10.941
it was just right

19:11.984 --> 19:13.235

No.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.463
Or maybe she's not
that complicated.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.257
She probably just wasn't
that into me.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.886
Okay, so it's not a good time.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.107
to Sid and Hannah's love!

20:39.321 --> 20:42.074
<i>♪ It's a wonderful world... ♪</i>

20:42.074 --> 20:44.201
Oh, wow. This is actually good.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.829
Yes. This is gonna be
a good memory from our wedding.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.459
Uh, what is this?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.880
This appears to be a sex tape

20:56.880 --> 20:58.590
made in your office
earlier tonight

20:58.590 --> 21:01.885
that they must have accidentally
edited it into our montage.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.347
Or... did we edit
it in on purpose

21:05.347 --> 21:07.891
as a special gift
to spice up your wedding night?

21:07.891 --> 21:10.310
- Charlie, no!
- Yeah, no, it was actually a mistake.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.645
Turn it off! Turn it off!

21:11.645 --> 21:13.105
Oh, my God,
is that my favorite jacket?

21:13.105 --> 21:14.356
That is <i>so</i> my favorite jacket.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.607
You guys are ruining my life!

21:15.774 --> 21:17.109
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying...

21:20.737 --> 21:23.573
So, wait, are you two
back together again?

21:23.573 --> 21:25.617
No. That was just a last hurrah

21:25.617 --> 21:28.578
that we decided
to commit to video as a memento.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.623
But, starting now,
we are officially...

21:31.623 --> 21:34.418
<i>strictly</i> platonic friends.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.503
- Hug it out?
- Keep that thing away from me.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.385
- Hey... Where you been?
- Hey.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.887
Watching Ian walk out
of my life again.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.474
Yeah. Guess I'm gonna
be waiting a <i>little</i> longer

21:49.474 --> 21:51.018
to find what you guys have.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.644
Well, I hope you find a guy

21:52.644 --> 21:55.147
who can throw you
a better wedding party than I just did.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.400
Wait. Are you acting
so crazy tonight

21:58.400 --> 22:00.235
because you're worried about me?

22:00.986 --> 22:04.531
Yeah. Hannah, I wanted you
to have the greatest night ever.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.950
You know, it was my first duty
as your husband,

22:06.950 --> 22:09.036
and I tanked it.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.790
Okay, that's it. Everybody up!

22:14.166 --> 22:15.083
Why?

22:15.625 --> 22:17.044
Everybody <i>line</i> up!

22:17.044 --> 22:20.714
- Oh, my God! Is this happening?
- Oh... I think it is.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.632
Yeah! We're sliding!

22:22.632 --> 22:25.552

and now I'm doing
the Electric Slide.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.036
I think this is my rock bottom.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.829
I was wrong.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.540
Rock bottom wouldn't come
until later that year.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.250
Mom, please call me back!

22:57.376 --> 22:59.086
I think I'm dating my dad.
