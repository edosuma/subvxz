00:02.000 --> 00:04.440
RADIO PRESENTER: The time is 6.10.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.720
Barristers,
valiant public defenders,

00:07.720 --> 00:09.160
or a waste of taxpayers' money?

00:09.160 --> 00:11.080
The Government seems to
have taken a view.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.320
YOUTH: Try this one. Try this one.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.000
One critic accuses its legal
aid plans of

00:15.000 --> 00:17.960
"cutting justice for all as if
it were chips for dinner."

00:17.960 --> 00:21.600
That critic is Ashley Jeevaratnam,
barrister and blogger,
and he joins us now.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.080
Hey... You all right, fam?

00:23.080 --> 00:24.600
Mr Jeevaratnam, good morning.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.320
Good morning, Kirsty, yes, I blog
at the compassionatebarrister.com

00:28.320 --> 00:33.480
So, how should barristers be paid?
Well, this is a very serious matter.

00:33.480 --> 00:40.520
This programme
contains strong language.

01:05.519 --> 01:09.560
Whoa! Crap! Sorry. Sorry.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.840
Sorry. Sorry.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.000
Oh, sorry.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.360
Ah.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.640
Ah, Caroline, it's a fit-up. Now,
don't get me wrong, I hated Hassan.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.000
I could have done it.
I wanted to do it.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.600
Yeah, you also said you'd do it.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.240
Barman overheard you talking
to Johnny Rhino in the pub.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.039
Yeah... I was angry.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.040
Said I'd smash Hassan's head
in with a hammer.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.840
And two hours later, he's in a coma,
head bashed in with a wrench.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.240
There's a difference.
Can't you use that?

02:18.240 --> 02:21.720
Look, it was hard talk! Ask Johnny.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.800
We sat and watched The Apprentice
together later.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.480
I'd calmed right down.
DOOR BUZZES OPEN

02:25.480 --> 02:26.880
Sorry.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.360
Morning, sorry I'm late,
I got held up at security.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.480
Mike - this is Will,
my hot young pupil.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.320
Hey, Mike,
been reading your brief...

02:33.320 --> 02:34.480
Great stuff!

02:35.760 --> 02:37.000
Thanks for that, Will!

02:37.000 --> 02:40.360
We'll put that on the back
under the quote from Stephen Fry.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.880
Mummy wants her croissant!

02:46.520 --> 02:49.520
Fuck, I love pastry!

02:49.520 --> 02:51.600
You going to be a barrister, then?

02:51.600 --> 02:54.240
Oh, yeah, fingers crossed!

02:54.240 --> 02:57.600
I'm actually only three months in
and there are four of us

02:57.600 --> 03:00.040
and Chambers are only going to
give one place.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.440
So, it's actually kind of scary!

03:03.440 --> 03:06.680
Yeah? Tough breaks, eh?

03:07.840 --> 03:11.280
Right, let's see. OK, so,
witness hears you in The Stag,

03:11.280 --> 03:12.800
Hassan gets battered,

03:12.800 --> 03:16.720
police turn up at your gaff,
find a wrench with his blood on.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.960
Mike, I want to get you off,

03:18.960 --> 03:21.960
but we've got fewer defence points
than I have viable eggs.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.640
So, tell me something that helps.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.800
Did you get any frozen?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.920
Case-related. Not egg-related.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.280
Oh.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.920
Um...

03:37.920 --> 03:39.680
I might actually have something.

03:39.680 --> 03:45.720
OK, so, the police had everything
AROUND Hassan's body analysed.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.800
But he actually crawled to
where he was found.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.120
He was hit here by the table.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.880
And on the table were some of these
things. Worry beads.

03:55.880 --> 04:01.440
Now, these are not Hassan's, but the
police never had them analysed.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.960
So, what I'm thinking is, we get
the police to analyse the beads,

04:05.960 --> 04:08.560
we find the real killer,

04:08.560 --> 04:10.680
we get you home, Mike.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.040
Away from this whole ordeal.

04:15.360 --> 04:19.240
Yeah...maybe don't get those
analysed.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.160
They actually sort of look like
my worry beads.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.800
I had 'em stolen recently.
Might have my prints on.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.880
Look, I realise this
complicates things.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.400
OK. We offer a deal.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.600
They drop the big charge,
we admit grievous bodily harm.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.040
Plead to GBH?

04:39.720 --> 04:41.240
Yeah, I mean...

04:41.240 --> 04:43.080
I might have wanted to hurt him,

04:45.080 --> 04:47.200
but I didn't want to murder him.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.840
You said you were nowhere near him.
It's either/or, innit?

04:50.840 --> 04:53.360
DOOR BUZZES OPEN

04:53.360 --> 04:55.400
Wow! He is very guilty.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.320
Yes, well. That's the thing about
being a criminal barrister, Will.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.160
You do meet criminals. Yeah, it's
such a waste of resources.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.360
All those innocent people out there.
Where?

05:04.360 --> 05:06.400
Out there? Aren't there?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.880
Hm. Take your word for it.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.000
Now, baby boy,
I have crucial business for you.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.960
I left my laptop charger
in Chambers.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.800
I need you to fetch it for me,
please.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.880
From Chambers? That'll take hours.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.160
Well, it needs doing, Will.
Mummy needs her power.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.000
Actually, do you mind not
calling yourself Mummy?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.600
It's just, it is a little weird.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.520
But Mummy wants to call
herself Mummy.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.680
OK, well...fine, then.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.840
MOBILE RINGS

05:43.120 --> 05:45.160
Hey! There you are.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.680
I'd almost forgotten what you
sounded like. How's it going?

05:48.680 --> 05:51.320
Oh, knackered. I was up working
till 2am and now Caroline's got me

05:51.320 --> 05:54.240
travelling halfway across town.
OK, so, you know, you're running

05:54.240 --> 05:56.600
a lot of errands. You knew
it was going to be like this.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.240
Yeah, it's fine. I'm 29 and my job
is fetching chargers and pastry.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.520
Whoa! Sorry.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.240
At this conference, we're talking
about famine and refugee camps

06:04.240 --> 06:07.600
in South Sudan. What were you
saying about your job?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.960
I'm saying it's the worst. Poor me.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.920
This is worse than any other human
is experiencing at the moment.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.960
Remember, this is what you wanted.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.280
You know, making a difference,
helping people in need. Yeah.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.200
I am helping people in need
mostly, I guess.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.800
Although today, we've got
this absolute murderer... Oh!

06:22.800 --> 06:25.760
I'm sorry, I've got to go.
Oh. Save it. OK.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.160
OK, bye, love you. All right, bye!

06:27.160 --> 06:29.560
Love you t-
LINE RINGS OFF

06:42.360 --> 06:44.920
Hey, Will.
The junior tenants did odds

06:44.920 --> 06:47.120
on which of us will get tenancy.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.040
I'm Hot Robot!

06:49.040 --> 06:51.400
Wow! Sorry, Pia.
That's so objectifying.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.520
What?

06:52.520 --> 06:54.800
Oh, yes. Feminism.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.800
So if Danielle is Angry Chav,
then I'm guessing I'm...

06:57.800 --> 07:01.640
DJ Stupid. I guess because of the
headphones?

07:01.640 --> 07:03.640
And the nodding?

07:03.640 --> 07:07.160
You know that nodding you do,
that really annoying nodding?

07:07.160 --> 07:11.360
The DJ himself! Wills!
Shouldn't you be in Harringay?

07:11.360 --> 07:14.280
Oh, I just had to pop back.
Urgent business for Caroline.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.400
Seen the Deathball, then. Yeah!

07:16.400 --> 07:18.920
Just a little joke, isn't it?
Just a bit of fun.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.200
Yeah. It's just a bit of fun.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.800
What's that? What's what?

07:23.800 --> 07:26.800
That! Huge brief in your hands.
Oh, this!

07:26.800 --> 07:29.400
Just a massive organised crime case
for Miles.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.360
Two gangland bosses. Four-year-long
sting. Multiple CHISes.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.840
Oh, sorry. CHIS means...

07:34.840 --> 07:38.080
Covert Intel Source.
A paid grass, thank you, Liam.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.960
Liam says it sounds like "jizz"!

07:39.960 --> 07:41.200
SHE LAUGHS AND SNORTS

07:41.200 --> 07:43.600
Well, I mean, objectively it
does sound like "jizz".

07:43.600 --> 07:47.880
So, what, the head of chambers just
gave you this huge case, did he?

07:47.880 --> 07:51.160
Oh... I guess it must be hard
for you and Danielle.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.120
Because if we get
all the best jobs now,

07:53.120 --> 07:56.200
how are you ever going to
overtake us? It's a cruel system.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.760
We go up and up, while you go
round and down ad infi-shite-um.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.960
Liam, you have seen that your
nickname is Lanky Poison Twat?

08:04.960 --> 08:08.680
Seen it? Reclaimed it.
Made it a badge of pride.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.520
Call me LPT.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.480
Hey, Danielle! All right?

08:12.480 --> 08:15.480
Will, I'm headed to court.
You can come with if you like.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.680
Fuck off, Liam.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.080
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, well, keep it that way.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.840
Sitting there smirking
like you shat somewhere secret.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.560
Good to go? Yeah.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.480
"Angry chav"?!

08:29.480 --> 08:30.960
Wankers!

08:30.960 --> 08:34.159
My boyfriend Dave remortgaged his
house so I could go to law school.

08:34.159 --> 08:37.120
Made dumping him really hard.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.200
Now, I'm losing to Law Barbie
and that human lube-stick.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.920
Least you're not last.
All right, make it about you.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.040
I work constantly.
I fetch a fuckload of coffee.

08:49.040 --> 08:53.160
Plus, my pupil-master's
the biggest prick!

08:53.160 --> 08:56.520
Ashley does this thing where he says
something is not something

08:56.520 --> 08:59.200
and it's like automatically funny...

08:59.200 --> 09:01.040
He'll be like,
"This meal is not uncold,"

09:01.040 --> 09:03.520
or "This evidence is not undamning."

09:03.520 --> 09:05.600
I find it not un-fucking-annoying.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.280
Caroline's OK. We get on fine.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.000
You can't get on that fine.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.640
You're losing at Deathball.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.480
Caroline's your pupil-master.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.560
Who do you think tipped off
the other tenants?

09:19.880 --> 09:23.960
# With your headphones on
through the drizzled pane

09:23.960 --> 09:26.120
# Of a wet slate roof

09:26.120 --> 09:28.240
# Sun will turn to rain

09:28.240 --> 09:30.480
# Why are you the one?

09:30.480 --> 09:32.760
# Couldn't take the pain

09:32.760 --> 09:34.240

# Something good'll happen

# Wait and see... #

09:40.400 --> 09:41.600
Hey, sorry!

09:41.600 --> 09:43.400
# Ever had a little faith?

09:45.640 --> 09:48.040
# Ever had a little faith? #

09:49.960 --> 09:52.440
One charger.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.720
Got your post as well.

PHONE RINGS

09:56.400 --> 09:57.440
Oooh.

09:59.440 --> 10:03.160
Becca, hey! Mr Packham, one of
our junior tenants got delayed.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.760
We got a youth being sentenced
for street robbery and I need you

10:05.760 --> 10:07.280
hold her hand till he turns up.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.400
Aah, sorry, Becca. It's just,
I think Caroline needs me.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.920
Caroline doesn't need you.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.480
I don't need you.
You don't need me? Nope.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.800
OK.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.800
Well, just send me the details
and I'll take care of it. Cheers.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.240
Hi, Caroline...

10:29.240 --> 10:31.880
..you know how we're
three months in now?

10:31.880 --> 10:34.720
I was just wondering if you had
any feedback for me?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.520
Any areas for improvement...

10:36.520 --> 10:39.600
Oh. Wow.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.600
Your wig's too white.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.720
A wig that clean says -
"I am a clueless novice

10:44.720 --> 10:47.920
"who has never successfully
pleasured a woman."

10:47.920 --> 10:50.080
OK, cool. Thanks.
Is this about Deathball?

10:50.080 --> 10:54.360
No. No way.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.000
Caroline, I'm last...

10:56.000 --> 10:58.240
You can't get nervous
about that stuff.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.800
What makes a barrister?

11:01.800 --> 11:04.240
The brain of a fox.
The liver of an ox...

11:04.240 --> 11:06.680
The hugest of cocks, right.
The hugest of cocks.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.240
Right, right. So, take that
trouser Orca of yours

11:09.240 --> 11:11.120
and get me a cinnamon twist.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.400
Oh, no. No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.000
Caroline?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.880
Cinnamon twist.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.440
The latest bar access stats are out.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
Aw...

11:30.400 --> 11:33.840
Kids from working-class backgrounds
are at such a disadvantage,

11:33.840 --> 11:35.720
I mentioned it on the radio
this morning,

11:35.720 --> 11:38.600
I think it's a very serious matter.
Sorry, I didn't listen.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.440
Oh, God, no, no! It's nothing.
I'm sure I was awful. It's just...

11:42.440 --> 11:44.920
Don't think I'm not aware.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.720
I'm deeply aware.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.160
Would you like a coffee, Ashley?

11:49.160 --> 11:51.680
Yes. That would be not unwelcome.

11:51.680 --> 11:55.120
Radio's Ashley Jeevaratnam.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.760
Aww! There you are.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.240
Caroline! They asked and I said yes.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.720
I didn't hear it.
No! Quite right too.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.720
It was nothing. Piece of shit.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.000
Any chance of carving it today?
You drop the attempt.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.880
We'll plead to GBH.
Ohh...I'd love to.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.960
But your guy's got previous 18s,
aggravated burglary.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.360
He is a very naughty boy.
Go on! Carve it. You want to.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.160
Caroline, if I carved,
I'd be making a booboo.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.920
And we can't be making booboos,
can we?

12:20.920 --> 12:23.320
QC interviews next week.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.360
Oh. Those are then, are they?
Don't pretend.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.600
I know you're up for it too.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.360
Actually, I've been pushing for
more women at silk level.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.960
I think it's a very serious matter.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.560
Actually, I didn't apply.
I mean, what's silk?

12:36.560 --> 12:42.240
I don't need my talent confirmed
by some cloak of...worm spunk.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.840
Is that really what silk is?

12:43.840 --> 12:46.320
How it's made. Fine, don't carve.
We're going not guilty.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.960
Oh, come off it, you've got nothing!
Have I?

12:48.960 --> 12:52.160
I'm going to rain shit on you
like the BFG after a vindaloo.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.480
She didn't do it, Mr Packham!

12:56.480 --> 12:57.640
I didn't do it, it wasn't me!

12:57.640 --> 12:59.960
I'm serious, she wouldn't
hurt a fly, let alone a nurse.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.560
You gotta tell them. You gotta
appeal! Go lawful on their arses.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.120
Mind your language! Shut your face.
I'm not going to prison
for talking like a 12A. OK!

13:06.120 --> 13:08.040
Thank you, Gracie. Erm...

13:08.040 --> 13:10.320
So, this is a sentence.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.560
You've been convicted
and we can't change that.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.960
But we're going to write a letter
to the judge, explaining things.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.600
Explaining how sorry you are.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.920
Except I'm not cos I never done it.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.400
Yes. But this could stop you from
getting put in custody...

13:23.400 --> 13:25.920
So I have to say I done it
even when I didn't?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.760
Think of it as like a sacrifice.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.440
You know, like for a greater good.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.760
Right.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.680
Some Sydney Carton shiz.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.880
Yes! Sidney Carton shiz.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.280
Sorry, who?

13:37.280 --> 13:40.720
Sydney Carton in Tale of Two Cities,
duh! She's a big reader.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.160
Love a bit of Dickens.
Mainly though, I like poetry.

13:43.160 --> 13:47.480
Bit of Maya Angelou
or Carol Ann Duffy. Wow!

13:47.480 --> 13:49.480
Yeah! That is really cool, Gracie.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.600
Love that. Represent.

13:52.600 --> 13:57.600
"I am truly sorry
for any harm I did Miss Kessel."

13:57.600 --> 13:59.360
Prize-winning.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.680
Try this.

14:05.560 --> 14:10.320
"What we did to Miss Kessel
I remember like a bad dream.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.520
"And for the rest of my life,

14:12.520 --> 14:16.400
"I'll carry the pain of knowing
I fell from my true self."

14:16.400 --> 14:19.520
Whoa! Grace, this is amazing.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.200
Top of my class creative writing.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.680
Probably be a novelist
when I'm older. Or a slam poet.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.440
Yes! Why shouldn't you be?

14:29.800 --> 14:32.640
I honestly didn't do it, Will.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.200
I was just trying to stop
the others.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.200
You do believe me, don't you?

14:38.200 --> 14:41.520
Of course. And you are not getting
custody.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.840
Not with THIS baby.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.560
There are some really splendid
word choices.

14:47.560 --> 14:51.280
JUDGE: Well, young lady,
I have read your letter,

14:51.280 --> 14:53.480
and as you have clearly
shown remorse,

14:53.480 --> 14:56.240
I am not inclined to send you
into custody.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.720
I'll make a referral order
and you can go home.

15:07.320 --> 15:11.360
Gracie. At least she didn't
get custody.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.520
That could have broken her soul.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.600
Her sweet, fierce, lyrical soul.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.760
Yeah. She almost certainly did it.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.760
Probably the ringleader.
Well, my instinct says no.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.840
Whatever. We're working on Mike now.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.800
Great. Saint Mike the Murderer.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.320
Oh, I see. Mike doesn't prang
your Guardianista erection.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.400
Will, what do you think
we're doing this for?

15:37.400 --> 15:41.080
Doing what for? This. You know,
the reading, the talking,

15:41.080 --> 15:43.680
the working with screw-ups like Mike
instead of nice people

15:43.680 --> 15:47.040
with Cath Kidston tea-towels and
children mostly called Alfie.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.840
What are we doing this for?

15:50.840 --> 15:52.960
Just...ice...

15:52.960 --> 15:55.800
Shh.

15:55.800 --> 16:00.160
Shh! Jesus! No! To win.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.120
A barrister burns to win.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.280
Where do you get your fire?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.240
Were you bullied at school?

16:07.240 --> 16:10.440
Did your mum ignore you
or your dad demean you?

16:10.440 --> 16:12.440
Who the fuck are you, Will?

16:13.720 --> 16:17.160
Cos you need to find that.
At the moment it's all a bit...

16:17.160 --> 16:20.000
A bit what? Hufflepuff.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.160
IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Hu...

16:22.160 --> 16:23.520
What?!

16:25.440 --> 16:30.320
Er...Caroline, did you say
any of this to the junior tenants?

16:30.320 --> 16:32.200
The ones who are doing
the Deathball?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.520
Mm. Edited version.
For your own good.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.240
Cool. No, that's great. Thank you.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.920
Thank you very much.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.480
So, the defendant has entered
a not guilty plea.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.080
We'll start first thing
in the morning. Court rise.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.000
DJ Stupide. Liam?
What you doing here?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.560
Special business.
Lives depend on it, so...

16:57.360 --> 16:59.960
Caroline, never seen you
in court dress before.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.520
The effect is powerful.
Thanks, dimples.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.520
Why are you never nice like that?

17:06.560 --> 17:11.400
So, what say we adjourn to the local
watering hole to take libations?

17:13.040 --> 17:15.040
Oh, come on,
we hardly ever drink together!

17:21.560 --> 17:23.079
This is nice, isn't it?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.440
Getting away from the office,

17:24.440 --> 17:27.119
all the competition and shit
about tenancy.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.120
I've been wanting to talk to you.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.960
About the tenancy competition? Yep.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.120
Thing is Will, we guys,

17:36.120 --> 17:38.800
we shouldn't be wasting time
trying to destroy each other.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.360
Were we trying to destroy
each other?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.480
No! No, no, no.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.520
I'm just saying -
it's Pia and Danielle

17:45.520 --> 17:47.320
who have the advantage here.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.320
Cos most of the senior tenants
are men, right?

17:49.320 --> 17:52.520
So, they'll be flirting with them,
making themselves indispensable.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.000
Eh? We've got to watch out for it.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.360
First sign of any manoeuvres from
Charlotte Church, you come to me.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.640
SHE BELCHES
Gotcha.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.440
Oh, hey. I am in love. Six o'clock.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.160
She's got her back to us.
But you can tell.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.640
Might stride on up
and drop the B bomb.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.920
Does B stand for...

18:13.920 --> 18:16.080
Barrister! Women love it, Will.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.680
They want to get bare and jiggy
with the horsehair wiggy...

18:18.680 --> 18:20.440
You should go and speak to her.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.960
Stop talking to me.

18:21.960 --> 18:26.080
No, I'm going to bide my time, mate.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.720
Stalk the prey. Nice one, Liam,
that's masterful...

18:34.760 --> 18:38.280
Hi, excuse me. Hi! Hello, hi! Hi!

18:38.280 --> 18:43.760
Sorry, my friend and I were having
a bit of a heated argument

18:43.760 --> 18:46.680
about whose tie is better...

18:46.680 --> 18:48.760
How heated can that be?

18:48.760 --> 18:51.240
Pretty close to physical
violence, actually.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.960
It's a good thing that you're here.
Because I'd deck him!

18:54.960 --> 18:57.960
Hi, I'm Liam. I'm a barrister.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.640
Currently focusing on organised
crime, but hoping to specialise

19:00.640 --> 19:03.960
in trafficking and high-value fraud.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.480
Er...I think his tie's better
than yours. Oh, no!

19:07.480 --> 19:10.000
Ho, ho, ho! Pwned, my friend!

19:10.000 --> 19:14.400
Shucks. And, now, as a prize,
Liam here is going to buy you
a thank-you drink.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.160
Er, surely it's loser buys drinks...

19:17.160 --> 19:19.080
I think that would be too much
humiliation.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.000
Maybe I want you humiliated.

19:22.920 --> 19:27.080
Will, quick question -
how's your girlfriend?

19:27.080 --> 19:31.840
She is fine. Nessa is fine.
Thank you for asking, Liam.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.640
I think I'm just going to leave you
two guys to chat, if that's OK.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.040
Thanks.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.440
He's got a girlfriend.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.400
I'll pay you back.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.640
How was your chat with the young
Prince Philip?

19:43.640 --> 19:47.440
So, he's worried that you and Pia

19:47.440 --> 19:49.840
are going to sex your way
to tenancy.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.320
Not a bad idea.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.800
I could rub Ashley's nipples

19:52.800 --> 19:55.960
while he reads me the latest
poverty statistics.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.880
You OK? You spoke to Caroline?

19:58.880 --> 19:59.920
Yeah.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.320
Yeah, like I thought really
it's fine.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.680
She had a few pointers,
but as expected, really,

20:05.680 --> 20:08.160
just really excellent feedback
on the whole.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.640
If anything, I'm doing too well.
Mm!

20:21.360 --> 20:24.800
Didn't I see you earlier today?

20:24.800 --> 20:26.640
In the court.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.680
Maybe.
I don't really notice women, so...

20:29.680 --> 20:31.280
Such a good boyfriend!

20:33.200 --> 20:34.680
Do you...um...?

20:43.880 --> 20:46.120
Will, right?

20:46.120 --> 20:47.400
Selina.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Aren't you going to ask me
what I was in court for?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.680
Er, my guess is...something
really wicked.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.360
You're good!

20:58.360 --> 21:00.200
Guess my crime.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.360
Paedo.

21:04.480 --> 21:09.000
OK...er... Sorry. I'm very drunk
and cannot be held responsible
for what I do...

21:09.000 --> 21:11.520
Actually I can totally be held
responsible.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.760
Intoxication only goes to intent.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.880
Is this law stuff?

21:15.880 --> 21:19.240
Er, yeah, so basically,
to be guilty of a crime,

21:19.240 --> 21:22.320
normally you have to do it and also
intend to do it.

21:22.320 --> 21:26.000
But sometimes when you're drunk,
maybe you don't intend what you do

21:26.000 --> 21:27.800
to have the consequences
that it has.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.320
For instance, you might hit someone
over the head with a glass

21:31.320 --> 21:32.920
but not intend to maim him.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.400
Right. Or perhaps you could place
yourself really close to a girl

21:36.400 --> 21:39.400
and not intend to kiss her.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.960
Maybe. Maybe.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.440
But what if she kisses you?

21:44.440 --> 21:48.520
It's complicated. Legally.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.360
GAVEL BANGS
Morning, Will, good to see you!

21:56.360 --> 22:00.080
Caroline, really looking forward
to what you've got!

22:00.080 --> 22:02.440
No point hanging around.
Let's empanel the jury.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.800
Where did you go last night?

22:09.800 --> 22:12.680
Me? Must have lurched off.

22:12.680 --> 22:15.880
Not my fault. Not anyone's fault.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.760
Selina Veisi!

22:22.920 --> 22:25.200
Oh, mother of all fucks!

22:25.200 --> 22:27.600
No objections from counsel, I hope?

22:32.880 --> 22:34.920
It's not my fault.
She said she was a criminal!

22:34.920 --> 22:36.480
Something wrong, Ms Bratt?

22:39.240 --> 22:43.880
Your honour, my pupil, Mr Packham,
is acquainted with juror number 3.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.400
How so, Mr Packham?

22:45.400 --> 22:50.000
Er, Your Honour, hardly at all,
it's just we met last night.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.840
Casually?
I don't think that's a problem.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.040
Mr Packham won't be addressing
the jury...

22:56.720 --> 22:59.280
Sorry, Your Honour.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.080
It's just, there was a kiss.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.920
A simple kiss?

23:06.920 --> 23:09.320
Um...there were tongues.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.720
As in, it was a French kiss.

23:11.720 --> 23:16.520
Avec tongues. Not loads obviously.
Just two.

23:16.520 --> 23:20.320
My tongue. And her tongue.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.320
I mean you're not involved.
She's not your girlfriend?

23:23.320 --> 23:26.400
Oh, Christ, no, no.
That's Ness...that's Nessa...

23:26.400 --> 23:28.880
Fuck! Sorry, didn't mean to
say "fuck".

23:28.880 --> 23:31.840
HE CLEARS THROAT

23:31.840 --> 23:34.400
It happened, so...

23:34.400 --> 23:39.600
What I would like to get,
Your Honour, is a rewind, uh,

23:39.600 --> 23:42.120
by which I mean... Are you done?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.440
Yes.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.560
Thank you, Ms Veisi,
you are excused.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.280
I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.840
I wouldn't even have spoken to her
if Liam hadn't been...

23:55.680 --> 23:57.760
Whoa! Crap!

23:57.760 --> 24:01.320
Can you ask for more time?
Caroline, can you ask for more time?

24:02.680 --> 24:05.040
Your Honour,
I need to ask for some time...

24:05.040 --> 24:07.880
I'll give you ten minutes, Ms Bratt.
Your Honour.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.240
What is wrong with you?

24:12.240 --> 24:14.080
There's a CHIS.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.200
A grass? How do you make that out?

24:16.200 --> 24:18.200
So, the victim was attacked on
Tuesday evening.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.200
Come Wednesday afternoon, there's
one unit of police at Mike's.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.880
At the same time, there's another
unit interviewing the barman.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.400
The one that's supposed to have
told them about Mike.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.760
God, you're right. This has got CHIS
all over it. Sorry...

24:29.760 --> 24:32.600
It's fine... OK, so Liam was here
yesterday afternoon.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.040
He's working on this gangland
case and he was boasting to us

24:35.040 --> 24:36.560
about his big CHIS.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.160
Tenner says it's Johnny Rhino -
Mike's mate from the pub.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.680
That's why Liam was here.

24:40.680 --> 24:45.400
To check up on us. Johnny's
Old Firm, he's their source for the
big case as well as ours.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.480
And if it gets out, the
police's biggest operation
in years is fucked! Boom.

24:48.480 --> 24:52.560
Oh, I am going to shaft
Ashley so hard,

24:52.560 --> 24:55.560
it'll need a soundtrack by
Isaac Hayes.

24:58.280 --> 25:02.120
OK. So, the police do have a CHIS.

25:02.120 --> 25:06.280
But his identity cannot be revealed,
nor need it be.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.560
Is it Johnny Rhino?

25:08.880 --> 25:11.320
Erm...we neither confirm or deny.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.600
OK, say it was Johnny.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.520
It doesn't matter
where the intel came from.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.880
If it's true, it's true.
And it is true. Sure.

25:20.880 --> 25:26.120
Unless, say, DI Soulsby's paid CHIS
had the chance to set up my
client...

25:26.120 --> 25:29.480
Shit. I mean, um, did he...

25:29.480 --> 25:30.720
..have the chance?

25:30.720 --> 25:33.680
Johnny Rhino watched The Apprentice
at Mike's, night of the attack.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.840
Lots of time to plant a spanner.

25:35.840 --> 25:39.200
Shit. What is this?
Johnny didn't plant anything.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.920
Fine. Well, I'll call Johnny
and he can tell that to a jury.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.080
Shit!

25:44.160 --> 25:46.720
If we reveal Johnny's identity,
he's dead within a week.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.640
Four years' police work
goes down the tube.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.680
I don't give an arse.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.720
And the judge will say either you
give us a fair trial or you jog on.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.680
She is not incorrect.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.720
So, Ash, what'll it be?

26:01.720 --> 26:03.560
Drop charges?

26:03.560 --> 26:05.920
Or watch the Police Commissioner's
biggest CHIS in years

26:05.920 --> 26:08.080
slipping through your fingers?

26:11.640 --> 26:14.760
We'll drop charges. Super.

26:14.760 --> 26:19.080
Will, Mummy could murder
a pain au raisin.

26:19.080 --> 26:23.240
Well played, Will. That'll mean
points in the Deathball.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.760
Yep. All hail the valiant defender
of wholly guilty psychopaths!

26:26.760 --> 26:28.640
Well, it all balances.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.480
You stopped that poet kid
from going into custody. Sure.

26:31.480 --> 26:35.320
If Gracie's rhymes can inspire
just one more person than Mike
viciously murders...

26:35.320 --> 26:38.280
Weird, innit? You think it's going
to be a battle of the minds.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.920
Actually, it's just people
fucking up. Liam. Johnny Rhino.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.080
The police. Yeah.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.440
Right from those beads. What beads?

26:47.440 --> 26:50.120
Do you remember those worry beads
on the table?

26:50.120 --> 26:54.920
They were Mike's. The police just
didn't even have them tested.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.400
Will! They haven't dropped
the charges yet.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.520
Yes, they have.
Ashley said they did.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.280
No. They've gotta take it out in
front of the judge.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.640
Shit, what am I going to do?

27:04.640 --> 27:07.080
Well, you can't tell 'em.
That'll make me look an idiot.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.800
No, of course not.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.480
No, excuse me! You're seriously
going to tell them!

27:11.480 --> 27:13.440
Too right, I am. It'll finish me.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.560
You're meant to be my friend!
Oh, fuck that!

27:15.560 --> 27:17.760
This is my chance to go second.
Sorry! Stop running!

27:17.760 --> 27:19.080
You look ridiculous!

27:21.880 --> 27:23.640
Oh, no, you fucking don't...

27:25.680 --> 27:30.920
What the fuck? Aw, mate!
Must've taken a wrong turn.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.880
Good luck with that door. Oh! You!

27:34.440 --> 27:36.800
SHE SCREAMS

27:39.120 --> 27:40.160
Touche.

27:46.400 --> 27:51.560
Very well, then. If the Crown is
offering no evidence,

27:51.560 --> 27:55.000
members of the jury,
you are discharged.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.240
Young lady dropped that off earlier,
Mr Packham.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.000
Gracie! Will!

28:41.760 --> 28:45.040
Thank you! Headphones, phone...

28:45.040 --> 28:47.440
Gracie, seriously?! ..laptop.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.000
Hey, Will, be clever,
just lie there for 30 seconds,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
or Jake here will cut you.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.160
Cool. There's a wig in here?
Oh, give it him. He needs it.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.200
Excuse me?

29:01.200 --> 29:02.480
See you around.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.800
Rude.

29:09.305 --> 29:15.757
