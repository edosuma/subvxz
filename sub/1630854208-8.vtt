00:02.536 --> 00:04.004
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:04.105 --> 00:06.207
<i>I understand
why you're doing it.</i>

00:06.307 --> 00:08.142
I know. I hate lying to Mom.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.743
Then you tell her.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.213
<i>I recognize
that hip-toss technique.</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:13.581
Mel taught me the same move.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.083
You could've really
hurt that boy.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.617
Robyn, I overstepped. I did.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.687
But you need to remember
that we chose this life.

00:19.787 --> 00:20.588
Dee did not.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.456
I decide what is appropriate

00:22.556 --> 00:23.491
for her to learn.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.759
Not her. Not you.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.994
Your aunt
rubbed shoulders

00:27.095 --> 00:27.995
with everyone.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.297
Basquiat
even invited her

00:29.397 --> 00:30.364
to do an exhibit with him.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.366
It just wasn't
quite ready yet.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.834
In that moment,

00:33.934 --> 00:35.636
I just felt exposed.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.238
Where?

00:37.338 --> 00:39.240
Yeah. I-I'm on my way.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.478
Where is he?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.480
Where's
my brother?

00:51.519 --> 00:53.087
Where's my brother?

01:11.705 --> 01:12.840
No!

01:12.940 --> 01:13.974
No.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.976
Get up!
Get up!

01:16.076 --> 01:17.245
Tell me
where Edison is!

01:17.345 --> 01:18.712
Get up!

01:18.812 --> 01:20.981
Tell me
where you took him!

01:40.601 --> 01:42.370
Thank God!

01:42.470 --> 01:43.504
Where have you been all night?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.105
I was
worried sick!

01:45.206 --> 01:46.474
You know,
wh-when you left

01:46.574 --> 01:48.108
that frantic message,
I called you back,

01:48.209 --> 01:49.443
but you didn't answer.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.811
You know, and I tracked
your phone to some kid

01:50.911 --> 01:52.713
who told me that-that
it was on the street.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.615
I must've lost it
during the chase.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.717
The chase? What chase?
What is going on?

01:56.817 --> 01:59.119
Something happened to Edison.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.121
What? Your brother?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.122
What-What's
going on?

02:02.223 --> 02:03.491
Ruby called me last night,

02:03.591 --> 02:05.493
and she said
that Ed had been carjacked.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.727
Except they didn't
just take his car--

02:06.827 --> 02:08.396
they grabbed him, too.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.664
Oh, my God. Honey, why-why-why
didn't you just wait for me?

02:10.764 --> 02:11.732
I would've
helped you.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.167
'Cause it-it happened so fast.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.203
She was hysterical, so I just--
I had to...

02:15.303 --> 02:17.305
Without anybody knowing
where you were? Come on, Mel!

02:17.405 --> 02:18.806
There was no time!

02:18.906 --> 02:21.242
Harry, I was just focused
on finding my brother.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.777
The driver was my only lead,
and now he's dead.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.779
I have no way
of finding Edison now.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.481
We're gonna find him together, okay?

02:27.581 --> 02:29.483
I'll call Rob.
Wait, you can't.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.884
She's angry
because she found out

02:30.984 --> 02:32.653
I was training Dee
behind her back.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.422
No, I don't care what's
going on between the two of you.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.823
This is family.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.768
Figured an early morning meeting
would require coffee.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.103
Thanks, Marcus.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.872
Anytime.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.341
So, what's up?

02:53.441 --> 02:55.509
This doesn't feel
like a case.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.845
No, actually,
it's about Mel.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.514
She's been training
Delilah in self-defense,

03:00.614 --> 03:02.683
although I expressly
forbade it.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.151
Ouch.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.954
Should've put a shot
of whiskey in that coffee.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.190
I mean, she's my best friend.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.859
Hell, she's like my sister.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.727
But the fact that she would go
behind my back like that...

03:13.827 --> 03:15.663
Feels like a betrayal.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.832
And I'm trying
to move past it.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.536
Sure you're willing to throw
that kind of friendship away

03:22.636 --> 03:24.572
because of one mistake?

03:26.407 --> 03:28.141
It's not a mistake.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.477
It's my daughter.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.412
No doubt.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.080
You know,
a wise woman once told me

03:33.180 --> 03:36.717
that the only person you hurt
by holding a grudge is yourself.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.489
I was talking about your father.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.823
That's different.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.825
You're right.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.428
Friends are the family
we choose.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.229
Which is why this hurts
even more.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.066
Right.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.904
Hey, Harry.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.443
Dee! Let's go.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.011
Trish is gonna be
here any minute

04:04.111 --> 04:05.446
to take us to
the art gallery.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.047
Sorry.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.116
Oh. Mom left early, huh?

04:09.216 --> 04:11.885
Yeah.
Was it
a work thing or...?

04:11.985 --> 04:14.021
Uh...

04:14.888 --> 04:16.256
She's still mad at me.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.492
You know, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't say "mad."

04:18.592 --> 04:21.629
You know, she's just, you know,
working some things through.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.531
I really messed up, didn't I?

04:23.631 --> 04:25.699
She just needs a little time.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.769
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.270
We don't have time
for you to feel sorry.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.205
You and Trish talked me into
signing up for this contest,

04:32.306 --> 04:35.242
and now I am going
to need your support.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.710
I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.446
I'm sorry. And this is your day
and you are going

04:38.546 --> 04:39.713
to win
that contest.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.482
Dee, that's not what
this is about.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.883
Trish.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.221
Wow.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.123
Are you ready to win
that contest?

04:50.223 --> 04:52.292
The two of you!

04:52.393 --> 04:53.694
Art

04:53.794 --> 04:56.897
isn't about winning or losing.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.900
It's about
affecting people.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.269
It's not about
bragging rights.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.771
Oh.
Mm. First prize--

05:03.871 --> 05:05.606
all-expense-paid trip
to Paris,

05:05.706 --> 05:06.674
an art class
at the Louvre

05:06.774 --> 05:09.042
and $5,000.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.745
Oh, my gosh.
That sounds amazing, Aunt Vi.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.747
Okay, so there's no part of you
that wants to win

05:13.847 --> 05:15.549
the free trip to Paris
or the bragging rights?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.351
Are you crazy?
Of course there is.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.152
<i>Allons-y!</i>

05:19.252 --> 05:21.054
<i>Allons-y, ma ch√®re!</i>

05:25.493 --> 05:26.994
Oh. Hey, Rob.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.597
Thank you for coming.
Listen, I'm so sorry about Dee.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.231
We'll deal with that later. Okay.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.934
What's important right now
is finding your brother.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.473
I asked my sister to join us.
She saw the whole thing.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.075
Ruby, this is Robyn.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.512
She's an old friend
of mine from the military.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.579
She's gonna help us
find Edison.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.280
Nice to meet you, Ruby.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.884
No offense, but I've given a
full report to the police, Mel.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.320
What can she do
that they can't?

05:53.421 --> 05:55.889
Well, Robyn has a
certain skill set.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.958
She's got a way
of doing things.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.727
You know what? You're just
gonna have to trust me on this.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.695
We're lucky
that she's helping us.

06:01.795 --> 06:02.996
I know this must be tough.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.398
Can you bring me up to speed?

06:04.498 --> 06:07.100
Mel told me you
witnessed the carjacking.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.571
I was waiting for Edison
outside a coffee shop.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.706
I saw his car approaching.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.842
Then, out of nowhere, this...

06:14.942 --> 06:16.810
black cargo van
blocked his path.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.846
A man jumped out of the car
and stuck a gun

06:18.946 --> 06:20.247
in Ed's face,
trying to pull him

06:20.347 --> 06:21.715
out of the car.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.083
It looked like Ed
put up a fight,

06:23.183 --> 06:25.052
so the man forced himself
in the car

06:25.152 --> 06:27.855
and drove away
as quickly as he could.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.122
Uh, the van took off, too,

06:29.222 --> 06:31.592
but I got a picture
of the license plate.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.960
Quick thinking.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.596
The man who got into
your brother's car--

06:35.696 --> 06:36.730
can you describe him?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.632
Um, white,

06:38.732 --> 06:41.301
average height, uh,
really short hair.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.736
Uh, I know it's not much.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.873
No, it's still helpful.
Thank you.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.876
Here's my cell.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.211
Please, call me the
moment you know anything.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.080
Don't worry.
I'll keep you in the loop.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.716
If it's all right, I'd rather
get my updates from your friend.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.350
This is
her thing, right?

06:57.451 --> 06:59.753
No offense.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.088
None taken.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.089
Okay.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.957
Thanks, Ruby.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.330
Eddie should've
just given him his car.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.032
God knows what that guy
did to him by now.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.401
All right, babe,
don't go there. Okay?

07:14.502 --> 07:17.037
You know, if we can find
footage of the carjacking,

07:17.137 --> 07:18.639
we can I.D.
the guy, okay?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.474
Uh, because, uh,
Ruby's description

07:20.574 --> 07:21.542
was too vague
to be helpful.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.410
Ruby.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.812
Not a fan?

07:24.912 --> 07:26.046
Don't get me wrong--
I love Ruby, you know?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.481
She's like a sister-in-law
to me.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.850
Just, you know,
she-she's just so condescending,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.018
the way she talks to you.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.385
You know? Like she's
better than you.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.521
Which, obviously,
also makes her delusional.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.389
Why does she speak
to you like that?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.925
Oh, man,
it's a whole thing.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.927
Ruby thinks that
I'm wasting my life

07:40.027 --> 07:41.428
because it doesn't
look like hers.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.163
Her husband's a banker.
They've got three kids.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.199
The house in Connecticut
with the yard and the dog.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.401
And, you know, I... run a bar.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.604
Oh, God. You don't
just run a bar.
I know.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.739
But in her mind,
I never grew up.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.440
And our brother
Matthew's

07:53.541 --> 07:56.443
serving overseas
and Eddie and I are in the city,

07:56.544 --> 07:58.946
so she is the one who
takes care of our parents.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.413
She takes 'em
to the doctor,

08:00.514 --> 08:02.616
the grocery store.
She cooks, she cleans.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.718
Yeah. So a little resentment.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.019
Yeah. Well, we've
offered to help,

08:06.119 --> 08:07.788
but she insists that
she's got it, so...

08:07.888 --> 08:09.089
It's 'cause
she's a control freak.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.490
She just likes
things done her way.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.725
The "right" way.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.326
To be honest, Ruby
and I were never

08:13.426 --> 08:14.828
really close anyway.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.029
Me and Ed,

08:16.129 --> 08:18.065
we always had
each other's backs.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.867
Since the day
he was born,

08:19.967 --> 08:22.502
I've always looked out for him.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.105
Hey.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.173
Hey.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.408
We're gonna bring him home.

08:31.211 --> 08:31.912
I got it.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.781
I got Ed's car.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.317
This looks like the moment
he was carjacked.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.626
Just like Ruby said.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.628
Can you identify the driver?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.096
I-- All I get is a profile.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.297
It's not enough
for facial rec.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.765
What about the guy
you chased down?

08:51.865 --> 08:52.800
What do we know
about him?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.501
Dealer named "Wolf" Machado.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.370
Based on the clock tattoo,
he must've done some time.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.572
You're right.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.407
Michael "Wolf" Machado.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.810
He was in Rikers
from 2014 to 2019.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.111
Known associates?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.345
Let's check
his cellmates.

09:09.516 --> 09:12.185
That's him! That's the guy
who got into Ed's car.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.220
Jim Voss.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.022
Yeah, he's a career criminal.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.357
Multiple assaults,
armed robbery.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.492
Out for three years
on supervised release.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.461
Does he have a phone?
Maybe we can track him.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.196
Let's see.

09:25.332 --> 09:29.036
All right. I found
a phone Voss uses,

09:29.136 --> 09:31.271
but he turned
his GPS off.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.206
It's all right.
Look, if I can access the router

09:33.306 --> 09:35.275
where it was last on, we might
be able to find him, all right?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.177
What's this?
Somebody sent him

09:37.277 --> 09:39.012
a hyperlink yesterday.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.919
Oh, my God.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.521
This wasn't a random carjacking.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.392
Edison was targeted.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.441
Okay. Dante's putting out
a BOLO on Edison's car.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.244
We find that and we find him.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.913
What about the guy
who grabbed Edison?

10:13.013 --> 10:15.582
I don't know. I mean,
I haven't been able to find

10:15.683 --> 10:18.051
any connection whatsoever
between Jim Voss and Edison.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.320
So it's likely someone
hired Voss to abduct him.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.122
But who? My brother's
a sweet guy.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.491
He's got lots of friends.
He's well-respected at work.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.694
He's a hedge fund manager,
right?
Yeah.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.729
Vertex Investments.
It's a multinational firm.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.799
Exactly. So it could have
something to do with his job.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.434
Lot of money on the line.
High-stakes transactions.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.203
I tried to access
his work files,

10:36.303 --> 10:38.806
but like any financial
institution worth its salt,

10:38.906 --> 10:40.607
it's got an air gap server.
Somebody would have

10:40.708 --> 10:41.942
to go in there in person.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.444
Tell me exactly what to do.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.780
Okay.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.916
Just give me one second.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.752
Now...

10:51.852 --> 10:53.754
most people,
this would take hours.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.023
Of course,
most people aren't me.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.958
Uh...

10:58.058 --> 10:59.126
decoded.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.729
Take this.
Put it in any computer

11:01.829 --> 11:03.596
running on the
network at Ed's work.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.998
It'll open up a back door.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.666
I'll be able to access
the server remotely.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.269
Done. I'll circle back with you
when I have more.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.706
While Robyn's doing that,
I'll check out Ed's apartment.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.843
Uh, maybe something there
will tell us what this is about.

11:15.943 --> 11:19.046
Hey, we're gonna
find him, okay?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.982
It's gonna be okay.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.018
Okay.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.630
Oh, that's a good choice.
I like that.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.769
Aunt Vi?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.404
Mm-hmm.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.674
Is this piece
considered... good?

11:49.676 --> 11:50.811
The artist
is paying homage

11:50.911 --> 11:52.679
to the action painters
of the past,

11:52.780 --> 11:55.415
like... Jackson Pollock.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.450
Okay.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.087
Is there anything
you don't know about art?

12:01.588 --> 12:02.956
Come on, Professor,
there's a piece over there

12:03.056 --> 12:05.592
I'd like to get
your analysis of.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.805
Best work of art in here.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.248
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.183
Aunt Vi.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.520
Dee. It's okay.
I got her.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.123
Hey.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.125
This was a mistake.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.893
Hey. Just breathe.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.061
Breathe, babe.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.462
I don't know
what I was thinking.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.831
I know better.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.598
Viola.

12:45.698 --> 12:46.599
Look around.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.101
Look around.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.469
You belong here.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.438
Your work belongs here.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.841
Putting it on display,
having it...

12:53.941 --> 12:56.009
judged...

12:56.844 --> 12:58.345
I'm sorry if I pushed you
into this.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.948
I-I didn't...

13:02.115 --> 13:04.517
I just want people
to see what I see.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.521
And, to be honest, maybe
I was showing off a little.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.190
But you don't want to be here,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.125
it's all right. Let's go.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.660
Let's just go home.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.463
No.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.265
Just...

13:18.365 --> 13:20.200
give me a few minutes.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.302
Yeah.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.251
Looks like we're both having
a tough day.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.353
I'm sorry.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.354
It's okay. No, no, no.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.223
No, it's okay.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.092
May I join you?

13:50.630 --> 13:53.300
You one of the artists?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.035
Unfortunately.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.537
I came in here with
so much confidence.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.639
And then I put
my piece up and...

13:59.739 --> 14:02.142
saw the competition
and felt like a fraud.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.378
I've been there.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.315
How'd you deal with it?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.784
Pinot noir helps.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.989
Which one of the
pieces is yours?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.624
That one.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.629
How'd you get the texture
in the brush strokes?

14:23.964 --> 14:26.733
Um, I combined the
sawdust with the paint.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.102
Thickens the consistency.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.370
It's really good.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.039
You think so?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.340
Absolutely.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.475
Seeing
this painting,

14:35.575 --> 14:38.045
it makes my day.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.879
Aunt Vi?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.649
Come on. The judges are about
to announce the winners.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.317
Yay.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.921
Let's get this over with.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.623
Hey, babe. What's going on?
Did you find anything?

15:56.723 --> 15:59.359
Someone ransacked
Ed's apartment.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.028
The drawers are open.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.595
There's papers on the ground.
The back window was broken.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.133
I honestly-- I don't know
what he's gotten himself into.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.667
Look, I-I don't know. All right?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.236
But I'll scour
every traffic cam,

16:09.336 --> 16:10.637
ATM cam, Ring cam.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.240
We'll get to the bottom
of who broke in, okay?

16:15.208 --> 16:16.843
Thank you.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.745
For being there.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.647
Yes, of course. I love you.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.815
I love you, too.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.965
When he didn't show up for work
this morning,

16:39.066 --> 16:41.234
I figured
he was just taking the day off.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.235
I hope he's okay.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.970
How do you know
Edison, again?

16:44.071 --> 16:45.705
I go way back
with his family.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.307
How long has he
worked for you?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.975
About six years now.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.244
I consider myself
more his mentor than boss.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.812
So then you know
him pretty well.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.716
Has he said or done anything
out of the ordinary lately?

16:56.816 --> 16:57.784
Not that I've noticed.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.018
But you should talk
to Monica.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.587
She and Ed work together
pretty closely.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.889
If anything was going on
with him, she'd know about it.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.691
Hey, Monica?
Please help her out.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.493
She has some questions
about Ed.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.994
Sure.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.729
Is he in some kind of trouble?

17:09.829 --> 17:11.364
That's what
I'm trying to ascertain.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.865
When was the last time
you saw him?

17:12.965 --> 17:15.268
Yesterday afternoon.
He took off early.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.504
Just got up and left
in the middle of the day.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.806
It's unusual for him.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.275
Can you show me his office?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.077
Of course.

17:26.446 --> 17:30.150
Truth is, I've been concerned
about Ed since his promotion.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.552
Promotion?
Yes.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.154
To executive director.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.722
Some people thought
he wasn't ready.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.890
Yeah?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.126
You one of those people?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.427
Oh.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.330
We've always had
this friendly rivalry

17:43.430 --> 17:44.531
with each other.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.832
Even though I was up
for the same job,

17:45.932 --> 17:47.334
I really was happy for him.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.070
Honestly,

17:51.171 --> 17:54.040
I am worried this new job
might be too much for him.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.246
I'm so sorry.
I have to take this.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.664
Any luck with the street cams
outside of Ed's apartment?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.466
Uh, no, not yet.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.969
But, uh, thanks to that back
door virus that Rob installed,

18:23.069 --> 18:25.004
I was able to access
your brother's work files.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.739
Oh, good. Find anything?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.608
Yeah. No, I did.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.377
It's not great.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.313
It-it looks like $20 million
is missing

18:33.413 --> 18:36.649
from one of his investors',
uh, accounts.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.286
A company called
ENX Capital.

18:39.386 --> 18:42.355
Went missing? Like, what, he
made a bad trade and he lost it?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.656
Not exactly.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.792
I mean, there are
some deleted transactions,

18:45.892 --> 18:47.394
but it looks like your brother

18:47.494 --> 18:50.463
made a request to wire
that money to a firm in Germany

18:50.563 --> 18:53.233
to execute a trade,
but the money, um...

18:53.333 --> 18:55.268
didn't get there.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.537
Where did it go?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.608
Um, to an anonymous account
in the Cayman Islands.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.911
Are you accusing my brother
of stealing that money?

19:05.011 --> 19:07.647
No, honey, I'm not accusing him

19:07.747 --> 19:08.981
of anything.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.683
I'm-I'm merely presenting
you with data here.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.253
Is it possible that he did
something like this--

19:13.353 --> 19:15.522
ENX caught him stealing
and that's why he got grabbed?

19:15.622 --> 19:17.224
No.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.425
It's not.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.859
I know my brother.
He wouldn't do that.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.161
And since when do corporate
investors abduct people?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.297
Yeah. That is a good point.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.133
Okay, let's take
a closer look at ENX.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.571
Okay, let's see.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.739
Their business ventures include

19:32.839 --> 19:35.242
an import/export biz,

19:35.342 --> 19:37.910
strip joints, uh,
waste management.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.580
All cash businesses.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.816
Money laundering
fronts?

19:43.916 --> 19:45.518
Okay, but for who?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.186
It looks like...

19:47.287 --> 19:49.188
the Colombian mob.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.190
Carlos Sanchez.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.892
He's the head of the New York
branch. Maybe there's

19:52.992 --> 19:54.794
some connection
with him and Jim Voss.
No, there's...

19:54.894 --> 19:57.497
there's got to be another
explanation for this.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.535
Hey. Dante.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.636
Any word on the BOLO?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.104
We found Edison's car.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.607
Unfortunately...

20:09.642 --> 20:11.811
...it's at the bottom
of the East River.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.629
They brought
the car up.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.997
The good news is,
there's no body inside.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.301
But... they haven't
opened up the trunk yet.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.236
Let's get this over with.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.787
Thank God.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.556
Let's temper expectations.
The current down there...

20:56.656 --> 20:58.291
No, he's alive.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.559
I can feel it.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.162
Harry.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.297
Eddie's not in the car.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.732
I know.
Because he's in the city.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.434
I've been checking
traffic cam footage

21:07.534 --> 21:08.901
to see
who broke into Ed's place.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.837
I found security footage
a block away.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.405
Guy walking with his head down.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.640
It's definitely Ed.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.008
So he got away
from Voss somehow.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.243
So why break
into his own place?

21:17.344 --> 21:18.378
It was torn apart.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.179
He was searching for something.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.515
If I just got away
from the Colombian mob,

21:22.615 --> 21:24.351
I'm trying to
get out of town.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.018
Passports? Maybe
credit cards?

21:26.118 --> 21:27.954
No, his passport
hasn't been swiped.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.689
There's been no activity in his
bank account or credit cards.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.525
Maybe he went back in
for cash.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.160
Or something he could sell.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.295
His Rolex.
I saw the box on the floor.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.764
He never wore it because
he thought it was too flashy.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.766
Any pawn shop
that buys a luxury watch

21:39.866 --> 21:41.834
has to run the serial number
to make sure it's not stolen.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.203
I got it.
A Rolex serial number was run

21:44.303 --> 21:46.873
at a pawn shop on 37th and 7th
less than an hour ago.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.408
What was he doing
all the way down there?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.042
That's nowhere near
his brownstone.
But it is near

21:50.142 --> 21:52.044
Penn Station and
a bus terminal.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.213
He's trying to get out of town.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.648
Let's split up.
You take Penn Station.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.083
I'll take the bus terminal.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.559
Sorry, Aunt Vi.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.662
Oh, honey, it's okay. I'm fine.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.665
I actually had
a lovely afternoon.

22:12.765 --> 22:16.436
Surrounded by beautiful art

22:16.536 --> 22:17.837
and two of my favorite girls.

22:28.314 --> 22:29.348
Hey.

22:30.617 --> 22:31.851
What's going on?

22:31.951 --> 22:33.853
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.321
I was counting
on this to work.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.357
I'm struggling to pay
my bills and rent.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.260
My parents were right-- I
should've just gotten a real job

22:41.360 --> 22:43.295
instead of dealing
with this nonsense.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.599
That would be a shame.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.401
You have a gift.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.303
This painting
is beautiful.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.205
The judges don't think so.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.007
Who cares?

23:00.246 --> 23:02.949
When you painted this,
how did it make you feel?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.220
Yeah.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.057
That's how I feel
when I paint.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.493
We do this
for ourselves.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.327
If other people
like it, then...

23:15.428 --> 23:17.163
it's just a bonus.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.298
I just...

23:19.398 --> 23:21.468
I want to be a
really great artist.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.769
You already are.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.838
You just have
to believe it.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.278
Thank you.

23:33.345 --> 23:36.348
How 'bout we get
that frame fixed?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.253
Thank you.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.928
Eddie! Thank God!

23:49.028 --> 23:51.330
What are you doing here?
It's not safe.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.832
There are some really dangerous
people after me.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.866
I know. Let's go.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.635
What? Wait, how did you find me?

23:55.735 --> 23:56.969
I'll explain everything later.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.270
Right now,
I got to get you to safety.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.405
Come on. Okay.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.807
Excuse us.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.911
So...

24:05.011 --> 24:06.779
this friend, you were
in the military with her?

24:06.879 --> 24:08.047
Yeah.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.649
Trust her with my life.

24:09.749 --> 24:10.850
And yours.

24:10.950 --> 24:11.818
And this is her place
we're going to?

24:11.918 --> 24:12.952
Yeah.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.988
You still haven't told me
how you knew I was in trouble.

24:16.789 --> 24:17.790
Do Mom and Dad know?

24:17.890 --> 24:18.825
Eddie, before we get into that,

24:18.925 --> 24:20.226
I need to ask you something,

24:20.326 --> 24:22.428
and I need you
to be completely honest with me.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.732
Did you steal money
from the Colombian mob?

24:25.832 --> 24:29.168
I didn't steal anything
from anyone.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.138
Wait, Colombian mob. Is that...

24:32.238 --> 24:34.240
is that who ENX Capital is?

24:34.340 --> 24:35.575
You didn't know?

24:35.675 --> 24:38.010
No. I-I had heard rumors
that one of our investors

24:38.110 --> 24:39.245
was a front
for a crime syndicate,

24:39.345 --> 24:40.780
but I didn't believe
it was real.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.914
Now it makes sense
why they grabbed me.

24:42.014 --> 24:42.982
Well, if you didn't take it,

24:43.082 --> 24:44.551
then where did their money go?

24:44.651 --> 24:46.185
I don't know.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.120
Someone must've set me up.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.589
Who would've done that?

24:50.422 --> 24:53.392
A lot of people at the firm were
jealous I got that promotion.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.861
Felt like I had a target
on my back.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.262
Did you tell your boss about it?

24:56.362 --> 24:57.496
No.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.965
I was afraid to
until I could prove

24:59.065 --> 25:00.432
that I wasn't the one
who took the money.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.804
I knew you didn't take it.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.773
I knew it with my whole being.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.675
I appreciate that, sis.

25:08.775 --> 25:09.909
But I'm pretty sure
the Colombians

25:10.009 --> 25:11.410
don't have
the same faith in me.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.945
If I hadn't jumped out
of that moving car...

25:13.045 --> 25:14.914
Hey, don't worry.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.883
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.824
Okay.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.694
Not much in the way
of gourmet eats

25:27.794 --> 25:29.061
around here, I'm afraid.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.630
Are you kidding?
I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.164
This is awesome.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.300
When this is over,
we should have

25:34.400 --> 25:37.069
a big family dinner
at Mom and Dad's.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.606
Yeah.
We can invite Ruby
and her gang,

25:39.706 --> 25:40.840
all the cousins.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.309
We'll ask Lola
to make the turon

25:43.409 --> 25:44.644
that no one knows
how to make.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.345
And her, um, Kare-kare.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.214
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.818
It'll be nice to get
the family together again.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.552
Yeah.

25:54.887 --> 25:55.822
What was that?

25:55.922 --> 25:57.990
The motion detector.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.060
What is Ruby doing here?

26:01.160 --> 26:02.494
You said she was worried,
so I texted

26:02.595 --> 26:03.796
and told her where we were.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.898
No, Ed, this is bad. No.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.199
Ed, are you okay?

26:07.299 --> 26:09.201
What did they--
What did they do to you?

26:09.301 --> 26:10.703
We need to get out
of here right now.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.371
What? Why?

26:22.514 --> 26:24.283
You were followed.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.153
What are you doing
with a gun?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.955
You two need to
take cover right now.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.289
Now! Go!
What?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.862
Rob?
What's going on?

26:35.962 --> 26:37.897
They found us.
I need backup.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.501
What's happening?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.170
Mel!

26:44.937 --> 26:45.838
Oh, my God.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.601
They took him.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.317
Damn it.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.895
What the hell was that, Melody?
Who took Ed?

27:42.995 --> 27:45.131
Where did you learn
to fight like that?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.002
Mel, it's Rob.
Don't shoot.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.605
You okay?

27:53.706 --> 27:54.673
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.575
What is going on?
Who took Ed?

27:56.675 --> 27:58.610
The Colombian mob, Ruby.
That's who.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.279
Who the hell are
you people?

28:00.379 --> 28:02.014
Look, I know you have
a lot of questions,

28:02.114 --> 28:03.615
but we don't have time
to answer them right now.

28:03.716 --> 28:06.886
Uh, where are you going?

28:06.986 --> 28:08.755
I'm going to get our brother.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.522
What about me?
I can't stay here.

28:10.622 --> 28:11.891
You'll be fine.
If they wanted you,

28:11.991 --> 28:13.159
they would have taken you
with Ed.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.094
The NYPD will be here
any minute.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.729
You'll be safer
at the station.

28:20.632 --> 28:23.302
Hey, I'm gonna bring him home.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.171
Melody.

28:26.672 --> 28:28.775
Be careful.

28:33.780 --> 28:35.147
They've had two chances
to kill Edison.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.117
They haven't. Why?
They want their 20 million back.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.886
They must need him alive
to get it.

28:39.986 --> 28:42.388
Well, we know they can't access
the system remotely.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.924
They're taking him
to his office.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.398
Hey, hon, I'm slogging through
transactions at Ed's firm.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.266
I figure if we can figure out
who set him up,

28:54.366 --> 28:56.368
maybe we can prove to the mob
that they got the wrong guy.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.137
I don't think we have
that kind of time, Harry.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.806
We think they're taking him
to his office.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.141
Can you get eyes there?
Yeah.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.948
It looks like they're
already there.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.163
Hurry up.
Okay, just give me
a minute, please.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.899
It's not easy
to move $20 million.
40 million.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.134
What?

29:28.234 --> 29:30.736
You heard me.
Consider it interest.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.414
Quit stalling

29:42.514 --> 29:45.918
and make the transfer.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.553
He's going to be okay.

29:47.653 --> 29:48.955
They'll keep him alive
as long as he's useful.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.289
Once they get
their money...

29:50.389 --> 29:52.324
Look, if your brother is
anything like you,

29:52.424 --> 29:53.692
he's a survivor.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.162
He'll find a way to stay alive.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.864
Thanks, Robyn.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.200
Listen, about Dee...

30:01.300 --> 30:04.003
Hey, let's just focus

30:04.103 --> 30:06.105
on finding your brother,
all right?

30:08.908 --> 30:10.977
Okay.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.247
What are you waiting for?

30:15.347 --> 30:16.849
I think somebody
changed the password.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.951
Make the transfer now,

30:19.051 --> 30:21.620
or I will kill you
and the rest of your family.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.189
Okay.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.729
Heard something upstairs.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.999
Go check it out.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.921
Okay, it's going through.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.395
Soon as he's done,
put a bullet in his head.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.675
Find anything?
No. All clear.

31:16.775 --> 31:19.411
Get back down here.
We're almost done.

31:19.511 --> 31:22.214
Copy that.
On my way.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.388
What's happening?

31:32.858 --> 31:34.126
Why'd it stop?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.761
I don't know what's going on,
I swear. It's not me.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.629
What the hell did you do?
Let-let me try again.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.431
Hey, I managed to pause
the transfer,

31:39.531 --> 31:40.933
but I can't hold him
off for long.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.434
You guys got to get in there.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.336
Almost there.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.184
I don't know what's going on,
I swear. It wasn't me.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.886
Let me try again.
What the hell did you do?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.889
Maybe you'll work better
with a few less fingers.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.058
No, no! No, no!

32:06.158 --> 32:07.726
No!

32:17.303 --> 32:19.405
Hey, Voss.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.807
It's over.

32:21.907 --> 32:24.043
Send Edison out unharmed

32:24.143 --> 32:26.345
and save yourself
a world of hurt.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.814
Oh!

32:34.853 --> 32:38.690
Make one move,
and he dies.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.359
You're playing this all wrong.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.961
Put down your gun.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.730
You first.

32:44.830 --> 32:48.267
I will shoot him.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.436
Not on my watch.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.449
Mel. Mel!

33:03.549 --> 33:05.851
Stop, stop!

33:05.951 --> 33:08.887
That's enough.
He's not worth it.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.058
Come on. Edison's safe.
It's over now.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.529
Let's go.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.434
Thanks for coming
to my rescue.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.370
You know I got your back.

33:24.470 --> 33:25.971
Always have.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.220
I'm glad Mel's brother
is okay.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.454
Yeah.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.956
Me, too.
But you're still upset

33:45.057 --> 33:48.127
with her about the training
behind your back.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.063
I am,

33:51.163 --> 33:52.698
but it's more
than that.

33:52.798 --> 33:56.068
The fact is,
I've always kept my private

33:56.168 --> 33:59.105
and professional lives separate.

34:00.306 --> 34:03.509
Walls are all down now,
and you don't like it.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.114
I don't know how
I feel about it.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.066
What's up, Anthony?

34:28.167 --> 34:30.336
Glad I could catch you
before you left for the airport.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.670
Who are you?

34:31.770 --> 34:34.273
Oh, I'm, uh, Edison Bayani's
brother-in-law.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.108
What do you want?

34:36.208 --> 34:38.377
I just wanted to let you know
that your flight

34:38.477 --> 34:40.045
to the Caribbean
is cancelled.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.747
Well, it's not cancelled,
the flight's still going,

34:41.847 --> 34:43.182
you're just not
gonna be on it.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.783
How did you...

34:44.883 --> 34:46.518
Find out about
your evil plans?

34:46.618 --> 34:49.488
Uh, well, as it turns out,
I'm pretty good,

34:49.588 --> 34:51.423
some say brilliant,
at, uh,

34:51.523 --> 34:54.560
computers, and unfortunately,
that's really bad news for you.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.462
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.530
Eh, fair enough.
Let me explain. Um,

34:58.630 --> 35:00.632
so I found it
really hard to believe

35:00.732 --> 35:03.469
that Edison would steal

35:03.569 --> 35:05.070
from his investors.

35:05.171 --> 35:08.039
You know, so I decided to do
a little sort of tour

35:08.140 --> 35:09.074
of your work servers.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.909
What?

35:11.009 --> 35:13.379
How did you...
Ah, don't worry about it.
The point is,

35:13.479 --> 35:15.247
after I restored
all the deleted

35:15.347 --> 35:16.882
transactions, I discovered that

35:16.982 --> 35:18.884
you were the one
who stole $20 million

35:18.984 --> 35:21.086
and diverted it to an account
in the Caymans...

35:21.187 --> 35:22.788
...and then pinned it on
my brother-in-law.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.423
I mean, I guess
the short version is

35:24.523 --> 35:27.493
you mess with my family,
you mess with me.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.661
This is crazy.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.597
I would never steal money
from an investor.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.932
I mean, it's not really me
you have to convince,

35:34.032 --> 35:36.835
you know, it's your investors
at ENX Capital.

35:37.703 --> 35:38.837
Judging
by your face,

35:38.937 --> 35:40.406
I'm getting the distinct
impression that

35:40.506 --> 35:43.409
you're aware that they're
a front for the Colombian mob.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.177
Don't worry about it,

35:45.277 --> 35:47.579
you're gonna be perfectly safe
in a prison cell.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.083
Anthony Walters, please
step out of the vehicle.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.890
Place your hands
behind your back.

36:00.359 --> 36:03.729
Can you make it tight, you know,
so it hurts a little?

36:03.829 --> 36:06.365
You have a right
to remain silent.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.869
Hey.
Hey.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.704
I am so glad
you guys are okay.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.807
Me, too.
Thanks to Mel.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.175
Okay.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.945
Hey, Ru.
Ed's right.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.647
He's here today
because of you.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.749
You're a real-life superhero.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.284
I don't know about that.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.618
You are.

36:26.718 --> 36:27.953
Sorry I've

36:28.053 --> 36:29.721
underestimated you
all these years,

36:29.821 --> 36:32.057
which brings me to the
millions of questions

36:32.157 --> 36:33.492
that I have.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.793
I bet you do.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.695
Uh, have a seat.
Look, I haven't been telling

36:36.795 --> 36:37.996
anyone what
I've been doing,

36:38.096 --> 36:39.965
what I am doing
with Rob and Harry.

36:40.065 --> 36:41.833
I hope you can
understand why.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.635
Sort of. Not really.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.136
Siblings are supposed to
tell each other stuff.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.138
Oh, right, like the way you
called me right away

36:47.239 --> 36:48.874
when you knew
there was trouble at work?

36:50.409 --> 36:51.443
I haven't told you guys

36:51.543 --> 36:52.711
everything either.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.346
My life is a mess.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.547
What do you mean?

36:55.647 --> 36:56.915
Um...

36:57.015 --> 36:59.651
I can't keep up with it all.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.087
Taking care of the kids
and Mom and Dad.

37:02.187 --> 37:03.322
It's been a real strain.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.656
You've always said

37:04.756 --> 37:05.957
you wanted to do it all.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.359
Why didn't you
say something sooner?

37:07.459 --> 37:10.829
You know I'm not good
at asking for help,

37:10.929 --> 37:12.964
but since we're sharing...

37:14.566 --> 37:16.302
I'm sorry, Ruby.

37:16.402 --> 37:20.105
Ruby, you do not have to do
everything yourself.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.407
We want to help you.

37:21.507 --> 37:22.908
Thank you.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.410
I guess we've all
been keeping

37:24.510 --> 37:25.944
secrets from each other lately.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.646
Yeah, let's not

37:27.746 --> 37:29.681
do that. From now on,
no more secrets.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.017
Oh, except from Mom and Dad.

37:32.117 --> 37:34.386
I don't think they're ready
to know what you really do.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.822
Fair point. Finally,
something we can all agree on.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.457
Cheers to not telling
Mom and Dad.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.125
Yeah.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.527
Oh, hey, babe.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.728
Hi.
Where were you?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.863
Oh, you know,
just tying up

37:44.963 --> 37:46.798
some loose ends.
Making sure justice was served.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.700
No big.
Oh, that's all.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.502
I can't believe Anthony
set me up.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.804
Well, you know, on the upside,
uh, a senior vice president

37:52.904 --> 37:54.272
position
just opened up.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.674
Maybe you want to throw
your hat in the ring.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.976
Thank you, Harry,
for everything.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.978
You got a good
one, Mel. Loyal,

38:00.078 --> 38:01.747
brilliant, and the man
can rock a sweater

38:01.847 --> 38:03.214
like nobody's business.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.084
Have I ever told you how
much I adore your sister?

38:07.953 --> 38:11.457
‚ô™ But I'm-a need a little air ‚ô™

38:11.557 --> 38:13.825
‚ô™ You been giving me nothin',
but I'm-a get it somewhere... ‚ô™

38:13.925 --> 38:15.260
Hey, Mom. Hey.

38:15.361 --> 38:18.263
We need to talk.

38:18.364 --> 38:20.165
Okay.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.803
I'm very disappointed

38:24.903 --> 38:27.939
that you lied to me
about training with Mel.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.041
I know.
I am so sorry...

38:30.141 --> 38:32.411
That being said,

38:32.511 --> 38:34.179
I get it.

38:34.279 --> 38:36.848
Really?
You want to have some

38:36.948 --> 38:40.118
say in your own safety,
I get that.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.854
But one of the most important
things to learn

38:42.954 --> 38:46.425
with this skill is when
or when not to use it.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.326
You could've seriously

38:48.427 --> 38:49.661
hurt that boy in school.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.329
I know,
and it will not happen again.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.733
Good, because it's not about
just throwing punches and kicks.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.768
You have to think,

38:56.868 --> 38:59.170
learn to use your words,
your mind.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.609
I guess I have a lot to learn.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.343
Yeah, you do.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.683
But you'll get there.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.553
Just remember to tell Mel

39:14.653 --> 39:15.821
to teach you
all the pressure points.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.823
No matter how strong
your opponent is,

39:17.923 --> 39:19.458
they all have pressure points.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.027
Wait, hold up.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.929
You're still gonna let me
train with her?

39:24.029 --> 39:26.398
There's no better teacher.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.967
Thank you.

39:33.439 --> 39:36.307
No more secrets, okay?

39:36.408 --> 39:37.509
Promise.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.811
Okay.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.614
Robyn?

39:43.915 --> 39:46.351
Hey.
Hey.

39:46.452 --> 39:48.520
The infamous Trish.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.821
Great to meet you.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.289
Great to meet you, too.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.158
Finally, all my favorite people
in the same room.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.462
Tell them
the good news.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.363
Ooh, that
sounds juicy.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.365
I got a job offer.

40:00.466 --> 40:03.034
What? Oh, my gosh.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.903
The director of the program
is a good friend of mine, and

40:05.003 --> 40:07.439
he was so impressed with Vi's
work and your delicate touch

40:07.539 --> 40:09.074
with the other
young artists,

40:09.174 --> 40:11.843
she got invited to teach
at the Kano Arts Center.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.779
That is great. Wow.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.514
You said yes, right?

40:15.614 --> 40:17.549
I-I-I said I'd think about it.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.217
What is there to think about?

40:19.317 --> 40:21.419
They will be lucky to have you,
those students.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.889
That's what I said.
I mean,
seriously, Auntie,

40:23.989 --> 40:25.323
you inspire us
each day.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.925
It's time for you
to spread it around.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.326
You love me,

40:28.426 --> 40:30.228
but that would mean
a much busier schedule

40:30.328 --> 40:32.798
and a lot less time to,
you know, help out around here.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.166
Hey, don't worry about us.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.068
If this is what you
really want to do,

40:37.168 --> 40:38.570
we'll figure it out.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.005
Totally.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.040
Whatever you need,
you have our full support.

40:42.140 --> 40:45.511
It is really enticing,
the idea of

40:45.611 --> 40:49.214
shaping the new generation
of young artists.

40:51.817 --> 40:52.718
Okay!

40:54.586 --> 40:58.456
‚ô™ You been giving me nothin',
but I'm-a get it somewhere ‚ô™

40:58.557 --> 41:00.926
‚ô™ I swear. ‚ô™
