<i>Last season on "Royal Pains"...</i>

00:02.410 --> 00:04.939
- How about today we save two
for the price of one?

00:04.941 --> 00:07.977
 You let a billionaire hospital trustee die
To save some kid off the street.

00:07.978 --> 00:09.914
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:09.915 --> 00:11.512
- This trip is gonna get you
back on your feet.

00:11.513 --> 00:14.243
- What trip?
- To the hamptons.

00:14.244 --> 00:16.912
- Boris kuester
von jurgens-ratenicz.

00:16.913 --> 00:18.233
Stay in my guest cottage.
For the summer.

00:18.234 --> 00:20.160
Be my concierge doctor.

00:20.161 --> 00:21.961
- Concierge doctor
to the rich,

00:21.962 --> 00:23.693
And an on-call doctor
to the rest of us.

00:23.694 --> 00:25.525
A robin hood of medicine.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.692
Jill casey,
hospital administrator.

00:27.693 --> 00:29.692
- So that happened.

00:29.693 --> 00:31.727
- You and I have been down
this road before, jill.

00:31.728 --> 00:33.726
- And which road is that,
dr. Adams?

00:33.727 --> 00:35.126
- The one with your
personal life on one side,

00:35.127 --> 00:36.691
Your professional life
on the other.

00:36.692 --> 00:37.925
Pick a lane, miss casey.

00:37.926 --> 00:39.591
- My ex was a local doctor too.

00:39.592 --> 00:40.791
- So he's a doctor
and I'm a doctor.

00:40.792 --> 00:43.890
That doesn't make me him.

00:43.891 --> 00:45.791
- I'm divya. Divya katdare.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.125
I'd like to be your p.A.

00:47.126 --> 00:49.559
- My p.A.
- Physician assistant.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.794
- Your mother hired me

00:50.795 --> 00:52.630
To help plan
your engagement party.

00:52.631 --> 00:54.065
- Your what?

00:54.066 --> 00:55.799
- You couldn't possibly
understand my situation.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.132
- Is this
an arranged marriage?

00:57.133 --> 00:58.697
What if she gets engaged
and moves to london?

00:58.698 --> 01:00.247
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

01:01.833 --> 01:04.430
- Is boris sick?

01:04.431 --> 01:05.393
- You can't let go of my hand,
can you?

01:05.394 --> 01:06.757
- No, I can't.

01:06.758 --> 01:08.755
- This thing you have,
it's genetic.

01:08.756 --> 01:11.723
- As you've so diligently
discovered, hank, quite fatal.

01:11.724 --> 01:14.624
- You've known your whole life.
- How it would end--yes.

01:14.625 --> 01:19.392
My family medical history.

01:19.393 --> 01:21.192
- You don't want your dad to see
how far you've come?

01:21.193 --> 01:22.893
- We worshipped him.

01:22.894 --> 01:24.861
But then when our mom got sick
and we needed him most,

01:24.862 --> 01:26.161
He just walked out on us.

01:26.162 --> 01:27.962
I don't give a damn
what he thinks.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.563
Apparently,
the check you wrote them

01:29.564 --> 01:31.730
For a new portable ekg machine
just bounced.

01:31.731 --> 01:33.431
What's up?
- We're broke.

01:33.432 --> 01:35.099
- What do you mean broke?
- We got scammed.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.567
- By who? I can't believe
you didn't tell me

01:38.568 --> 01:40.501
That dad took all our money.

- boris will do.

I'm short on time.
- I'm divya katdare.

02:24.763 --> 02:26.096
I work for hank.

02:26.097 --> 02:27.797
- I know who you are,
miss katdare.

02:27.798 --> 02:30.099
And in a manner of speaking,
hank works for me.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.133
So I'm hoping at least one us
knows where he is.

02:32.134 --> 02:33.968
- I'm sure he's with
a patient.

02:33.969 --> 02:36.836
- Well, we had an appointment
21 minutes ago.

02:36.837 --> 02:40.105
<i>Shall I grab a copy
of us weekly</i>

02:40.106 --> 02:41.906
And take a seat
in the waiting room?

02:41.907 --> 02:43.908
- I'll see if
I can track him down.

02:48.012 --> 02:52.647
Hank, divya again.

02:52.648 --> 02:57.417

[cell phone rings]

Can't seem to get ahold of you
so I'll cover the visit

03:25.972 --> 03:28.939
And try you again
when I'm done.

03:28.940 --> 03:31.807
Any other symptoms?

03:31.808 --> 03:33.475
- Yeah, I've had, uh,
nsee and ndles

03:33.476 --> 03:35.009
In my hands and arms.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.578
- Hmm. And what line of work
are you in, mr. Fisher?

03:37.579 --> 03:41.847
- I produce and star in a bunch
of silly infomercials.

03:41.848 --> 03:45.851
- Have you been working
very hard lately?

03:45.852 --> 03:48.052
- Actually,
I've been playing hooky.

03:48.053 --> 03:52.555
My dad passed away recently,
and left me this house.

03:52.556 --> 03:54.723
- Well, my condolences.
- Thank you.

03:54.724 --> 03:56.524
- Just been a lot of work
sorting through everything.

03:56.525 --> 03:57.959
And I have not been sleeping
much lately.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.360
Actually, that's a symptom,
right?

03:59.361 --> 04:00.560
"not sleeping much lately,"

04:00.561 --> 04:01.728
If you want to put that down.

04:01.729 --> 04:03.496
What do you think
might be wrong?

04:03.497 --> 04:04.731
- Well, I think
the sleeplessness

04:04.732 --> 04:06.399
Is causing anxiety

04:06.400 --> 04:08.835
And the anxiety's causing
everything else.

04:08.836 --> 04:11.839
I'm going to prescribe you
a low dose of ativan.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.006
That should do the trick.

04:13.007 --> 04:16.511
- Great. Okay.
Thank you.

04:16.512 --> 04:18.848
Oh, I was actually wondering,
just out of curiosity,

04:18.849 --> 04:21.349
Is there an actual hank
in hankmed?

04:21.350 --> 04:24.917
- There is. But he's--
- ah, he's playing hooky too.

04:24.918 --> 04:28.486
- [sighs]

04:31.389 --> 04:33.657
[ringback tone]

04:33.658 --> 04:35.826
- Hey, you've reached
evan r. Lawson, cfo of hankmed.

04:35.827 --> 04:37.460
Please leave a message.
Thanks a lot.

04:46.102 --> 04:50.671
[knocking at door]
dad?

04:50.672 --> 04:52.072
- The first vacation
he took us on

04:52.073 --> 04:54.507
Was a 20-minute drive
to new york city.

04:54.508 --> 04:57.510
He called it
"the ultimate island getaway."

04:57.511 --> 04:59.612
This is where we stayed.

04:59.613 --> 05:01.880
And this is where you tried
finding him a few years later

05:01.881 --> 05:05.452
After he left
on his permanent vacation.

05:05.453 --> 05:06.821
- It's not so permanent
anymore.

05:06.822 --> 05:08.355
Dad's at the bank.

05:08.356 --> 05:09.990
Right now, he's getting us
our money.

05:09.991 --> 05:11.391
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:11.392 --> 05:12.625
- And how long ago
did he leave?

05:12.626 --> 05:15.828
- He left 20 minutes ago.

05:15.829 --> 05:19.298
He left a couple hours ago,
okay?

05:19.299 --> 05:20.766
I woke up, he left a note.

05:20.767 --> 05:24.435
- Look at that.
He stole your move.

05:24.436 --> 05:26.370
Come on, ev, let's go home.

05:26.371 --> 05:27.638
You made a hell of a mess
out there.

05:27.639 --> 05:28.872
You can't clean it up
from here.

05:28.873 --> 05:32.542
- No, I'm not going home.

05:32.543 --> 05:34.710
He's coming back this time.

05:34.711 --> 05:37.980
I guarantee it.

05:37.981 --> 05:39.715
- How long have you been
in touch with him?

05:39.716 --> 05:41.650
- What--he's our father.

05:41.651 --> 05:43.518
- Despite my best efforts,

05:43.519 --> 05:45.554
It looks like there's still
one sucker left in this family

05:45.555 --> 05:48.757
Ready to buy whatever
eddie r. Lawson has to sell.

05:52.828 --> 05:55.862
Last chance.
You coming or not?

05:57.865 --> 06:00.833
Okay.

06:03.737 --> 06:05.305
[door slams]

06:25.058 --> 06:26.959
Have you seen a green folder?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.693
It was right here
on the counter.

06:28.694 --> 06:31.996
- You mean it disappeared
without notifying you?

06:31.997 --> 06:35.532
- Again, sorry about that.
- It's fine.

06:35.533 --> 06:38.568
I was just worried
about you guys.

06:38.569 --> 06:40.737
Well, a little less
about evan.

06:40.738 --> 06:42.872
Somewhere deep inside me,

06:42.873 --> 06:46.408
I probably knew he was sitting
in a suite at the waldorf.

06:46.409 --> 06:48.576
- [chuckles]
- sorry.

06:48.577 --> 06:51.512
I have not seen a green folder.
- Okay.

06:51.513 --> 06:54.581
- Any chance you can help me
decide our cfo's balance sheet?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.982
- How bad is it?

06:55.983 --> 06:58.017
- It is the accounting version
of pig latin.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.686
- No, I meant financially.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.956
- Well, because we're net 60
and our vendors are net 30,

07:03.957 --> 07:05.958
We depend on our reserves
to stay in the black.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.525
- In english?

07:07.526 --> 07:08.827
- If we don't find
some fast cash soon,

07:08.828 --> 07:09.861
We are in trouble.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.729
- [sighs]
- evan.

07:12.730 --> 07:14.064
- Don't blame him.
Blame me.

07:14.065 --> 07:16.299
- Uh, my paycheck bounced.
I blame him.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.901
- No, I let him put us
in this position.

07:17.902 --> 07:19.669
I should've known better.

07:19.670 --> 07:22.872
But I guess family
can cloud your judgment.

07:22.873 --> 07:24.907
- Tell me about it.

07:31.348 --> 07:34.683
- You want to talk about it?
- You mean about my party?

07:34.684 --> 07:37.352
About my involuntary
engagement?

07:37.353 --> 07:40.288
About my impossibly
complicated future?

07:40.289 --> 07:41.622
- Yeah.
- Not at all.

07:41.623 --> 07:43.557
We have bigger fish to fry.

07:43.558 --> 07:44.858
I.E. Your rain check

07:44.859 --> 07:47.727
With your displeased
patient/landlord.

07:55.868 --> 07:58.536
- Are you sick of trying
to make drinks at home

07:58.537 --> 08:00.671
That just
don't end up right?

08:00.672 --> 08:03.506
[microphone thuds]

08:03.507 --> 08:04.740
Eew. Yuck.

08:04.741 --> 08:05.941
Whenever I try to make drinks
at home,

08:05.942 --> 08:08.375
The proportions are all wrong.

08:08.376 --> 08:09.776
Well, not anymore.

08:09.777 --> 08:11.377
I have created
the electronic bartender.

08:11.378 --> 08:13.546
[cell phone ringing]

08:13.547 --> 08:17.248
This is a no-muss,
no-fuss recipe

08:17.249 --> 08:19.284
For classic cocktails.

08:19.285 --> 08:22.655
It's as easy
as pushing buttons.

08:22.656 --> 08:25.858
- Well, tell me,
how does freedom taste?

08:25.859 --> 08:28.527
- Freedom?

08:28.528 --> 08:31.630
Sorry to hear you had to leave
before the actual ceremony.

08:31.631 --> 08:33.530
- I know. Me too.

08:33.532 --> 08:35.600
- Must've been something
important.

08:35.601 --> 08:38.269
- It was, uh--it was business
and personal.

08:38.270 --> 08:42.472
So how did raj handle
being left at the altar?

08:42.474 --> 08:45.909
- I really don't have time
for chitchat, evan.

08:45.910 --> 08:49.579
I can't interpret your
kindergarten-level handwriting,

08:49.580 --> 08:52.683
Let alone your byzantine system
for insurance codes.

08:52.684 --> 08:55.686
- Whoa, don't get your scrubs
in a bunch.

08:55.687 --> 08:57.387
Everything's gonna work out
just fine.

08:57.388 --> 08:58.822
- You need to get back here

08:58.823 --> 09:00.724
And dig us out of the hole
that you put us in.

09:00.725 --> 09:01.925
And you need to do it now.

09:01.926 --> 09:03.661
This is the worst
possible time

09:03.662 --> 09:05.562
For you to throw into jeopardy
the one thing

09:05.563 --> 09:07.831
That still makes any sense.

09:07.832 --> 09:12.002
- Oh, my god.
You went through with it.

09:12.003 --> 09:13.604
Didn't you?

09:13.605 --> 09:17.474
You got engaged.

09:17.475 --> 09:18.742
Div--

09:18.743 --> 09:20.477
- The electronic bartender
is yours now

09:20.478 --> 09:22.813
For just four easy payments
of $19.95.

09:22.814 --> 09:27.285
- [speaking spanish]

09:27.286 --> 09:30.555
- Is there any language
you don't speak fluently?

09:30.556 --> 09:31.957
- Hank.

09:31.958 --> 09:34.359
<i>Por favor. Momento.</i>

09:35.962 --> 09:39.830
When you want to acquire
exquisite cuban roses,

09:39.831 --> 09:42.532
You have to go where they are
and learn the language.

09:42.533 --> 09:43.799
- Well, you must've
imported them

09:43.800 --> 09:46.903
Before the '63 embargo.

09:46.904 --> 09:49.538
- You know your history.

09:49.539 --> 09:51.974
What about my history?

09:51.975 --> 09:55.777
- Uh, I haven't finished
reviewing your file.

09:55.778 --> 10:00.281
And not just because
I lost it.

10:00.282 --> 10:01.950
I had to deal with
a family situation.

10:01.951 --> 10:05.286
That's an explanation,
but not an excuse.

10:05.287 --> 10:07.621
<i>- You know, hank, this is not
a quid pro quo arrangement.</i>

10:07.622 --> 10:09.323
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you like.

10:09.324 --> 10:10.624
- Thank you.

10:10.625 --> 10:11.892
- But perhaps
I'd be better served

10:11.893 --> 10:12.859
By another physician--

10:12.860 --> 10:15.695
One with fewer distractions.

10:15.696 --> 10:17.830
- Boris, you can trust me.
- Yeah.

10:17.831 --> 10:22.434
Unfortunately, I don't know
who you can trust.

10:22.435 --> 10:24.636
You don't have the file, hank,
because I have it.

10:24.637 --> 10:26.871
I found it laying out
in the guest quarters

10:26.872 --> 10:29.005
Like some coffee table
accessory.

10:29.006 --> 10:32.542
- Your file wasn't read,
your privacy wasn't violated,

10:32.543 --> 10:34.343
And your trust wasn't broken.

10:34.344 --> 10:36.045
I had a rough morning
and missed an appointment.

10:36.046 --> 10:38.981
<i>And for that, I'm sorry
because quid pro quo or not,</i>

10:38.982 --> 10:40.982
You deserve better from me.

10:56.596 --> 10:58.798
- Thank you for your help,
dr. Blair.

10:58.799 --> 11:01.900
- Uh, jill, can I speak
to you, please?

11:01.901 --> 11:04.768
- Hey, liz. Uh, what are you
doing down here?

11:04.769 --> 11:06.770
- Funny,
that was my question.

11:06.771 --> 11:08.538
I guess we're both used
to seeing the e.R. Docs handle

11:08.539 --> 11:10.006
This kind of work.

11:10.007 --> 11:12.408
Too bad you seem to be
systematically terminating them

11:12.409 --> 11:13.676
One by one.

11:13.677 --> 11:15.911
- That's rumor
and exaggeration.

11:15.912 --> 11:17.746
- You didn't fire dr. Madden
at the horse show?

11:17.747 --> 11:19.581
- Oh, no, I did.

11:19.582 --> 11:23.051
- And before even replacing him,
you didn't axe dr. Casey?

11:23.052 --> 11:25.053
- Charlie said I fired him?

11:25.054 --> 11:26.922
- Do you have a secret plan
to start cutting back

11:26.923 --> 11:28.723
On patient emergencies
as well?

11:28.724 --> 11:32.828
Because if not, jill,
I see a serious math problem

11:32.829 --> 11:34.663
In our future.

11:34.664 --> 11:36.765
- Maybe we should
discuss this later.

11:36.766 --> 11:39.835
- I understand
that we've just received

11:39.836 --> 11:42.003
The latest
press ganey scores.

11:42.004 --> 11:44.439
- Patient satisfaction up 10%.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.842
- Thanks to your efforts,
I'm sure,

11:46.843 --> 11:48.910
To integrate
the record systems

11:48.911 --> 11:50.712
And streamline
the referral process.

11:50.713 --> 11:52.881
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

11:52.882 --> 11:56.517
- But I'm a highly trained
g.I. Surgeon

11:56.518 --> 12:00.021
Called down here to run errands
far below my pay grade.

12:00.022 --> 12:01.890
I'm also a member
of the board

12:01.891 --> 12:04.726
Obligated to make sure
that surgeons like me

12:04.727 --> 12:07.528
Aren't wasting our time.

12:07.529 --> 12:09.263
- What are you saying?

12:09.264 --> 12:13.034
- What I'm saying
is that I'm really happy

12:13.035 --> 12:15.837
That the patients
are so satisfied.

12:15.838 --> 12:17.905
But the doctors aren't.

12:17.906 --> 12:22.610
And that's a problem
that you need to fix quickly.

12:24.546 --> 12:28.316
- And given the projected income
from this--

12:28.317 --> 12:31.987
- Hi, dieter. Bye, dieter.

12:36.491 --> 12:38.025
- And given
the projected income

12:38.026 --> 12:39.893
Of this week's
rather light schedule--

12:39.894 --> 12:42.695
- We'll be even worse off
in seven days than we are now.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.631
- Sorry to paint
such a rosy picture.

12:44.632 --> 12:46.332
- What are we gonna do?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.800
- You're gonna do
three things.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.402
First, you're gonna stop
worrying about money,

12:50.403 --> 12:51.970
'cause that's my job.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.772
Second, you're gonna take
a break

12:53.773 --> 12:55.673
And replenish your body's
essential inventories

12:55.674 --> 12:57.341
Of sugar and caffeine.

12:57.342 --> 12:59.643
And third, you are going
to join me

12:59.644 --> 13:02.245
On a little magic carpet ride
I like to call

13:02.246 --> 13:03.980
"the hankmed emergency
staff meeting."

13:03.981 --> 13:07.015
- You're about six hours late
for it.

13:07.016 --> 13:09.851
- Yeah, why you running
so behind today, ev?

13:09.852 --> 13:14.322
- Because I had a meeting
and I got stood up.

13:14.323 --> 13:16.957
And I'm sorry for that.

13:16.958 --> 13:18.792
But what I lack
in punctuality,

13:18.793 --> 13:21.628
I will more than make up for
in vision and in leadership.

13:21.629 --> 13:22.728
- I feel inspired already.

13:22.729 --> 13:24.496
- Over the next couple
minutes,

13:24.497 --> 13:26.264
You're gonna hear all about
my turnaround plan,

13:26.265 --> 13:27.865
Which will restore hankmed's
fiscal health

13:27.866 --> 13:29.900
And employee morale.

13:29.901 --> 13:33.670
The first step
in the turnaround plan is...

13:33.671 --> 13:36.539
Doo-buh-duh-duh-duh.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.875
The first step
is to face reality

13:38.876 --> 13:40.644
And manage expectations.

13:40.645 --> 13:43.546
The truth is, as word of
our setback begins to spread,

13:43.547 --> 13:45.748
The phones will temporarily
stop ringing.

13:45.749 --> 13:47.516
[cell phone rings]
look at that.

13:47.517 --> 13:49.017
Reverse psychology.

13:49.018 --> 13:50.985
The phone falls for that trick
every time, I find.

13:50.986 --> 13:52.821
Hello. Hankmed.

13:52.822 --> 13:55.356
And how can we make you feel
âª so much better today? âª

13:55.357 --> 13:57.892
Okay, calm down.
Do we know a spencer fisher?

13:57.893 --> 13:59.427
- Yeah, we do.

13:59.428 --> 14:00.695
He's at home.
He had an accident.

14:00.696 --> 14:02.697
Okay. Very--just calm down.

14:02.698 --> 14:03.998
Help is on the way, okay?

14:03.999 --> 14:05.433
This is a horrible connection.

14:05.434 --> 14:07.302
Great. Just stay right
where you are.

14:07.303 --> 14:08.903
See, the rainmaker's back.
The rainmaker's back.

14:08.904 --> 14:10.503
I just had to show up.
See what happens?

14:10.504 --> 14:13.238
- Then stay here
and make it pour.

14:25.514 --> 14:28.416
No security. No staff.

14:28.417 --> 14:31.385
This guy sure digs
his peace and quiet.

14:31.386 --> 14:35.254
- Or he did.

14:35.255 --> 14:38.424
- Evan, why are you here?

14:38.425 --> 14:40.759
- I'm here to help reboot
hankmed's finances

14:40.760 --> 14:42.628
In any way humanly possible.

14:42.629 --> 14:44.563
- Well, why don't you sell
that "hey, check me out" sign

14:44.564 --> 14:45.864
You drive around in?

14:45.865 --> 14:48.566
- [chuckles]
what, are you being serious?

14:48.567 --> 14:51.536
- Yeah.

14:55.872 --> 14:58.840
Whoa.

14:58.841 --> 15:01.610
- So I brought our new
and improved retainer agreement.

15:01.611 --> 15:03.345
And why didn't you tell me
we were treating

15:03.346 --> 15:04.613
Spencer the spaz?

15:04.614 --> 15:07.415
- We?
- Spencer the spaz?

15:07.416 --> 15:09.283
- He's an
infomercial salesmen.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.652
<i>- No, no, no, no.
He's the infomercial salesmen.</i>

15:11.653 --> 15:13.954
This the guy who brought us

of other user-friendly

15:16.858 --> 15:18.759

15:18.760 --> 15:20.394
- Hey, look,

15:20.395 --> 15:21.929
How useful.
- [chuckles]

15:21.930 --> 15:24.498
You never heard
his catchphrase--his mantra?

15:24.499 --> 15:26.967
"well, if I can do it,
anyone can!"

15:26.968 --> 15:29.936
- Mr. Fisher, it's hankmed!

15:29.937 --> 15:32.439
- I'm downstairs!

15:32.440 --> 15:36.543
Just follow the lights!
- What lights?

15:36.544 --> 15:39.979
[electronic beeping]

15:39.980 --> 15:42.882
- That's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

15:46.687 --> 15:50.290
Stay within the lights.
Stay within the lights.

15:50.291 --> 15:53.426
This is insane!

15:56.930 --> 15:59.665
- In here!
I threw my back out!

15:59.666 --> 16:01.767
And I can't move!
- You're in where?

You're in the giant fireplace?

16:57.488 --> 17:00.256
Here we go. Lower down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, good.

17:00.257 --> 17:02.058
- Oh, this is a nice position.
- I'm glad.

17:02.059 --> 17:03.893

from this position?

- Yeah. We're moving.

Okay. Gently down.

Careful. Watch the neck.

today more than ever, huh?

17:21.407 --> 17:23.842

all those products in this room?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.477
- No, my dad did.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.645
- Divya filled me in
on your dad's passing.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.281
I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

17:30.282 --> 17:31.482
They think
it was kidney failure,

17:31.483 --> 17:32.983
But my dad died--

Like he did everything else
in his life--

17:34.686 --> 17:36.653
Behind a veil of secrecy so...

17:36.654 --> 17:37.987
- Mr. Fisher,
how did you hurt yourself?

17:37.988 --> 17:39.822
- Oh, silly.

17:39.823 --> 17:41.823
I was up in the ceiling trying
to fix some of the wiring

17:41.824 --> 17:43.692
And my back just locked up
on me.

17:43.693 --> 17:45.426
Every time I move,
it hurts.

17:45.427 --> 17:46.594
- That's got to be normal,
right?

17:46.595 --> 17:47.962
With your level
of spaz-ticity,

17:47.963 --> 17:49.563
You must be getting injured
all the time.

17:49.564 --> 17:50.832
- Spaz-ticity.
I've never heard that one.

17:50.833 --> 17:52.301
That's good.

17:52.302 --> 17:53.469
You know,
I'm not really a klutz.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.438

Believe me.

to the world.

18:06.850 --> 18:09.952

18:09.953 --> 18:13.223
Okay. Does the pain go down
either or both of your legs?

18:13.224 --> 18:16.426
- No. It's just a big, big,
big ache in my lower back.

18:16.427 --> 18:19.629
- Would you push against
my hands with your feet?

18:19.630 --> 18:21.564
Okay. No abnormalities
in the deep tendon reflexes

18:21.565 --> 18:22.866

We're just gonna pick you up.
- Ow.

19:07.727 --> 19:10.362
- Any ulcer or diabetes
or allergies?

19:10.363 --> 19:11.396
- No.
- Okay.

19:11.397 --> 19:12.631
60 milligrams ketorolac.

19:12.632 --> 19:13.932
And continue the ativan.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.933
That should help the pain
and the spasm.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.635
- Okay. Is there anything
I can do

19:17.636 --> 19:19.804
To prevent this
from happening again?

19:19.805 --> 19:21.572
- Yes, avoid one-man
construction jobs.

19:21.573 --> 19:22.740
And as divya recommended
yesterday,

19:22.741 --> 19:24.241
Try to get some sleep.

- And the muscle relaxants
will impair

so no hard labor at all.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.515
- Especially not with tools.

- Guys, you should check
this out.

19:36.451 --> 19:37.849
- Whoa.

19:37.850 --> 19:39.851

was trying to set up

19:39.852 --> 19:41.719
His own concierge medicine
business...

19:41.720 --> 19:43.654
- Yeah, or he was prepared
to spend a very long time

19:43.655 --> 19:44.755
In this room.

19:44.756 --> 19:46.490
- Listen, between you and...

You and you and me,

19:49.626 --> 19:51.360
I'm not down here
to update this room.

19:51.361 --> 19:52.895
I'm down here
to dismantle it.

19:52.896 --> 19:55.897
As my dad got older,
he got more and more eccentric.

19:55.898 --> 19:57.665
He worked
and practically lived

19:57.666 --> 20:01.368
In between
these impenetrable walls.

20:01.369 --> 20:03.836
It's time for the panic room
to be retired.

20:03.837 --> 20:05.471
If you need any of those
medical supplies,

20:05.472 --> 20:06.771
Please take them.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.540
You'd be doing me
a huge solid.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.274
- Yeah, it's just
that we don't--

20:10.275 --> 20:12.376
We don't really
have a need for these supplies.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.011

who is trying to start up

20:14.012 --> 20:16.680
A free clinic.

20:33.294 --> 20:36.529
- Dr. Blair, I understand
you filed a formal complaint

20:36.530 --> 20:37.696
Against me.

20:37.697 --> 20:39.030
- Yes, I did.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.966
In advance of tomorrow's
board meeting.

20:41.967 --> 20:45.003
I can't just keep waiting
for you to right this ship.

- I've always considered you
not just a colleague,

But the person I turn to
for guidance in a situation

20:50.542 --> 20:53.677
Exactly like the one
you're putting me in right now.

20:53.678 --> 20:57.549
- I'm sorry. But my loyalty
is to hamptons heritage.

20:57.550 --> 21:01.587
- And when did you start
doubting mine?

21:01.588 --> 21:04.023
I didn't fire charlie.
He quit on me.

21:04.024 --> 21:05.991
- Professionally
or romantically?

21:05.992 --> 21:07.860
You know,
sometimes with you, jill,

21:07.861 --> 21:11.630
It's difficult to tell
just which one we're discussing.

21:11.631 --> 21:14.667
In fact, I heard
that your relationship

21:14.668 --> 21:15.934
With hank lawson
has been added

21:15.935 --> 21:17.870
To the health services
curriculum

21:17.871 --> 21:21.607
As a case study
in bad judgment.

21:21.608 --> 21:24.943
- First off, my judgment
has served this hospital

21:24.944 --> 21:26.879
Pretty damn well.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.816
And secondly, my relationship
with hank lawson is over.

21:30.817 --> 21:33.552
So the hospital board
is finally going to have to find

21:33.553 --> 21:35.554
A new talking point.

21:35.555 --> 21:39.424
- Miss casey, dr. Lawson's
waiting for you in your office.

21:46.631 --> 21:51.401
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:51.402 --> 21:52.768
Everything okay around here?

21:52.769 --> 21:54.437
- Not according
to our hospital's

21:54.438 --> 21:55.971
Most powerful surgeon.

21:55.972 --> 21:58.907
She thinks I've pretty much
ruined the place.

21:58.908 --> 22:01.242
[sighs]

22:01.243 --> 22:03.577
Did you stop by my house
the other night?

22:03.578 --> 22:06.279
- I did.
But this isn't that.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.480
This is just business.

22:07.481 --> 22:09.182
- Oh.
- No, no.

22:09.183 --> 22:11.450
I don't want you to think
I came to your workplace

22:11.451 --> 22:14.686
To rehash our relationship
or lack thereof or whatever--

22:14.687 --> 22:16.588
- Hank.
- Yeah.

22:16.589 --> 22:20.858
- Charlie's gone.
I finalized the divorce.

22:20.859 --> 22:25.861
Finally.
- Wow.

22:25.862 --> 22:30.498
Sounds like you got
your hands full.

22:30.499 --> 22:34.602
- I do. But you came here
on business,

22:34.603 --> 22:37.804
So what's up?

22:37.805 --> 22:41.006
- Oh, um, do you have time
to take a ride?

22:41.007 --> 22:44.643
- Ms. Newberg, it's evan.

22:44.644 --> 22:46.946
Let's talk
newberg business.

22:46.947 --> 22:52.288
Evan r. Lawson.
The cfo of hankmed. Ms. New--

22:52.289 --> 22:54.293
<i>Hello, allison.
Hey, ciao ciao.</i>

22:54.294 --> 22:55.932
How are you feeling?

22:55.933 --> 22:57.803
It's, uh, it's evan r. Lawson,
cfo of hankmed calling.

22:57.804 --> 22:59.273
We did the tb testing
for the staff

22:59.274 --> 23:01.343
At your restaurant.

23:01.344 --> 23:03.647
No, no, no. The results
are still negative.

23:03.648 --> 23:06.418
That's an interesting choice
of hold music.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.952
Sounds a lot
like a dial tone.

23:07.953 --> 23:10.554
And I thought we might do
some consulting for you

23:10.555 --> 23:13.491
Like maybe design
a hankmed approved healthy page

23:13.492 --> 23:15.392
For your menu.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.628
Yes, I can stick it.

23:17.629 --> 23:21.030
Oh, there's that catchy
hold music again.

23:25.668 --> 23:27.268
Baah!

23:27.269 --> 23:29.337
- Hey, spencer, it's hank.

23:29.338 --> 23:30.972
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm headed over there

23:30.973 --> 23:33.843
With jill casey so she can take
a look at that equipment.

23:33.844 --> 23:36.983
Hello? What's that sound?

23:36.984 --> 23:39.285
Uh, spencer, you're not
operating power tools

23:39.286 --> 23:41.421
Under the influence
of sedatives, are you?

23:41.422 --> 23:44.958
Hello? Can you hear me?

23:44.959 --> 23:46.860
- Everything okay?
- I doubt it.

23:46.861 --> 23:48.428
I don't get why that guy's
so obsessed

23:48.429 --> 23:50.463
With ripping out
part of his own house by hand.

23:50.464 --> 23:52.730
- Maybe it's not the room,
but what it represents.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.931
If I could demolish every trace
of charlie in my house--

23:54.932 --> 23:58.499
- You'd be living
in the driveway?

24:05.836 --> 24:10.339
Spencer?
- Help.

24:16.546 --> 24:20.614
- Oh.
- A nail gun? Really?

24:20.615 --> 24:23.518
- Hank, I swear, the spaz thing
really is just an act.

24:23.519 --> 24:26.554
- Okay.
- That's it. Spencer the spaz.

24:26.555 --> 24:29.256
I love your infomercials.
- Thank you.

24:29.257 --> 24:30.891
- Jill, could you prep me
a syringe of lido?

24:30.892 --> 24:32.859
- Sure.
- Thanks.

24:32.860 --> 24:34.561
- What's wrong with me?

24:34.562 --> 24:36.262
These accidents are connected
to my headaches

24:36.263 --> 24:37.597
And pins and needles,
aren't they?

24:37.598 --> 24:39.031
- Well, we'll start monitoring

24:39.032 --> 24:41.334
For cervical disc disease
or spinal stenosis.

24:41.335 --> 24:42.868
But I think your anxiety
and your traumas

24:42.869 --> 24:44.570
Are two separate issues.

24:44.571 --> 24:47.006
- By the way, how come
I'm not screaming in pain?

24:47.007 --> 24:49.008
- Well, the medications
you're on for one.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.676
Also, the nerves
near the puncture

24:50.677 --> 24:53.445
Were compressed by the swelling
and became anesthetic.

24:53.446 --> 24:55.181
But just to be
extra, extra safe--

24:55.182 --> 24:57.416
Thank you--I'm gonna give you
a shot of lidocaine.

24:57.417 --> 24:59.985
- Okay. Um, that stuff
that you're looking for

24:59.986 --> 25:01.754
Is back there if you want
to take a look.

25:01.755 --> 25:03.522
- Yeah.

25:03.523 --> 25:05.991
- Do you have a pair
of pliers?

25:05.992 --> 25:09.861
- Yes.
- Where might they be?

25:09.862 --> 25:11.463
- Over there by my dad's
thermostats.

25:11.464 --> 25:14.900
- Thank you.

25:14.901 --> 25:16.702
- Whoa.
That's how this works?

25:16.703 --> 25:18.670
- That's how this works.
- Oh, man.

25:18.671 --> 25:19.972
- On a count of three,

25:19.973 --> 25:21.440
I am going to pull
this nail out.

25:21.441 --> 25:22.708
- Okay, on three
or right after three?

25:22.709 --> 25:25.477
Is it 3, 2--ah!

25:25.478 --> 25:29.348
Oh. You're good.
- Thank you.

25:29.349 --> 25:31.416
- Are you sure I can have
all this equipment

25:31.417 --> 25:32.484
For my clinic?

25:32.485 --> 25:33.585
- It's all yours.

25:33.586 --> 25:35.320
Oh, by the way,

25:35.321 --> 25:36.955
There's a bunch of meds
back there that you can look at.

25:36.956 --> 25:38.590
They're on the shelf.

25:38.591 --> 25:39.891
- Yeah, I don't think
these are meds.

25:39.892 --> 25:41.560
I think these are old
chemical vials.

25:41.561 --> 25:42.794
- It's probably part
of your dad's lab.

25:42.795 --> 25:44.696
- Oh. That makes sense,
I guess.

25:44.697 --> 25:46.531
- Yeah, some of these
need to be handled carefully.

25:46.532 --> 25:48.300
I'm gonna go call my friend
on the hazmat team.

25:48.301 --> 25:51.269
But the rest I can store
in the hospital's dungeon,

25:51.270 --> 25:54.306
Along with 20 year's worth
of other useless antiques.

25:56.776 --> 25:58.410
- Keep this out of the line
of fire

25:58.411 --> 26:01.680
And it should heal just fine.

26:01.681 --> 26:05.250
There you go.
- Thank you.

26:05.251 --> 26:06.952
- Spencer, I know you don't
like this room,

26:06.953 --> 26:10.856
But we really got to stop
meeting like this.

26:10.857 --> 26:13.725
- My dad had two sides
to him.

26:13.726 --> 26:16.695
One was the brilliant,
industrious side.

26:16.696 --> 26:18.797
I'd call that his bright side.

26:18.798 --> 26:22.367
- And the other side?

26:22.368 --> 26:24.869
- The reclusive paranoid side.

26:24.870 --> 26:26.771
That's the side no one else
knew about.

26:26.772 --> 26:30.308
Now, clearly the bright side
wasn't passed down to me.

26:30.309 --> 26:32.677
You know?
I'm no genius, hank.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.212
I'm just a salesman
with good product.

26:34.213 --> 26:35.580
And I know that.

26:35.581 --> 26:37.448
- So you're afraid
you're destined

26:37.449 --> 26:39.484
To inherit his other side.

26:39.485 --> 26:43.454
- What if I end up going crazy
like he did?

26:43.455 --> 26:45.889
Can you assure me
that his mental illness

26:45.890 --> 26:48.358
Isn't genetic?

26:48.359 --> 26:51.862
- No. I can't.

26:51.863 --> 26:54.264
And I get wanting
to distance yourself

26:54.265 --> 26:55.265
From your dad's legacy.

26:55.266 --> 26:57.868
Believe me, I do.

26:57.869 --> 27:02.439
But, spencer, if you want
to nip insanity in the bud,

27:02.440 --> 27:04.074
I'll be honest with you,

27:04.075 --> 27:06.410
Trying to get rid
of this room seems way crazier

27:06.411 --> 27:08.945
Than just staying the hell
away from it.

27:20.166 --> 27:21.466
- Do you want to hear this?
- No.

27:21.467 --> 27:23.034
- You don't even know
what it is.

27:23.035 --> 27:24.835
- Sorry. You're right.
What is it?

27:24.836 --> 27:26.903
- It's the script for hankmed's
first infomercial

27:26.904 --> 27:27.971
To air on local stations.

27:27.972 --> 27:29.372
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:29.373 --> 27:31.240
All right, you want to hear it?
- Definitely not.

27:31.241 --> 27:33.342
- "hello, fellow denizens
of the hamptons.

27:33.343 --> 27:35.810
"are you sick of waiting rooms
and exam rooms?

27:35.811 --> 27:37.378
"are you tired
of rude receptionists

27:37.379 --> 27:39.048
"and negligent nurses?

27:39.049 --> 27:41.216
"well, the next time you're ill
or injured,

27:41.217 --> 27:43.051
"stay right
in your own living room

27:43.052 --> 27:45.253
Because we will come to you."

27:45.254 --> 27:46.687
How's it hitting you so far?

27:46.688 --> 27:48.389
- Like a wave of acute nausea.

27:48.390 --> 27:50.257
- Acute nausea.
I can actually use--

27:50.258 --> 27:51.792
That's good.
I can use that at the end.

27:51.793 --> 27:55.094
Okay, so--
- evan, please stop.

27:55.095 --> 27:57.028
- This could be our ticket
out of the doldrums.

27:57.029 --> 27:58.362
- I'd rather be
in the doldrums

27:58.363 --> 28:01.064
Than be hawking physical exams
on qvc.

28:01.065 --> 28:02.231
- You won't have
to hawk anything.

28:02.232 --> 28:04.266
I'm the talent.
- Oh.

28:04.267 --> 28:05.967
- Our newest patient, he could
be my performance coach.

28:05.968 --> 28:07.268
- As long as there's a hank,

28:07.269 --> 28:08.235
There will be no hankmed
infomercials.

28:08.236 --> 28:09.571
- All right, all right.

28:09.572 --> 28:11.206
- Furthermore...
- Furthermore...

28:11.207 --> 28:12.875
- Just because you're back
to normal doesn't mean

28:12.876 --> 28:14.442
That hankmed is, and it doesn't
mean that we are.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.310
So how about you stop worrying
about our media plan

28:16.311 --> 28:17.711
And you start worrying
about getting us

28:17.712 --> 28:20.080
Through the week
without any cash?

28:20.081 --> 28:23.116
Hi.
- Hi.

28:28.321 --> 28:31.357
The cold war's still raging?
- Yeah.

28:31.358 --> 28:35.026
He wouldn't even hear
my pitch.

28:35.027 --> 28:39.296
"fellow denizens."
"denizens."

28:39.297 --> 28:41.732
- Evan...

28:41.733 --> 28:46.068
It is time to ease off
the hard sell.

28:46.069 --> 28:48.971
You need to regain hank's trust
first as his brother

28:48.972 --> 28:52.841
Then as his cfo.

28:52.842 --> 28:54.409
And you were right.

28:54.410 --> 28:57.879
I didn't call off
the engagement.

28:57.880 --> 29:02.716
- I figured that giant ring
wasn't a consolation prize.

29:02.717 --> 29:05.052
What happened?
Did you just chicken out?

29:05.053 --> 29:07.687
- I didn't chicken out.

29:07.688 --> 29:11.224
What I realized
at the last possible moment

29:11.225 --> 29:14.026
Was that I had to let a dream go
and face the reality

29:14.027 --> 29:16.661
In order to embrace
what's most important:

29:16.662 --> 29:19.965
Family.

29:19.966 --> 29:22.267
Look, evan, I know
that you want hank

29:22.268 --> 29:24.203
To forgive your father
and welcome him back

29:24.204 --> 29:26.338
With open arms.

29:26.339 --> 29:30.408
But if you keep pushing
your dream despite the reality,

29:30.409 --> 29:35.113
You are going to lose
what matters most to you.

29:50.364 --> 29:53.098
Separate working quarters?

29:53.099 --> 29:54.733
Is this what it's come to?

29:54.734 --> 29:56.135
- Please don't leave me
with him.

29:56.136 --> 29:58.170
- I'll help you find
a great replacement.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.839
And I'll train them
to whip evan daily

30:00.840 --> 30:02.040
Just like I do.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.174
- That'd be great.

30:03.175 --> 30:04.975
- And trust me,

30:04.976 --> 30:06.777
I don't want to move
to raj's flat in london.

30:06.778 --> 30:08.778
- Yeah, but you have to.
- Yes, I do.

30:08.779 --> 30:10.413
Do you know why?

30:10.414 --> 30:14.017
- They're just not embracing
your accent over here?

30:14.018 --> 30:17.455
- Because sometimes
you have to meet family halfway

30:17.456 --> 30:19.892
Even if you don't get
where they're coming from.

30:19.893 --> 30:21.993
- You could argue london's more
than a halfway point.

30:21.994 --> 30:26.130
[cell phone rings]

30:26.131 --> 30:31.035
- Hmm. Spencer fisher.
Hello, mr. Fisher.

30:31.036 --> 30:34.038
Mr. Fisher.

30:34.039 --> 30:35.506
Signal dropped.

30:35.507 --> 30:38.142
He probably stuck his finger
in an electrical outlet.

30:38.143 --> 30:40.011
- Yeah, or go this head caught
in a vise.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.980
- Don't worry,
I'll take this one.

30:41.981 --> 30:45.917
- Great. As long as you take
that one too.

30:49.420 --> 30:51.888
- [speaking native language]

30:51.889 --> 30:54.090
- [speaking
native language]

30:54.091 --> 30:56.292
- Going for the old summer cut,
huh?

30:56.293 --> 30:58.862
- Has to go sooner or later.

30:58.863 --> 31:02.265
- I've reviewed your file.

31:02.266 --> 31:04.834
- Yeah, real page turner, huh?

31:04.835 --> 31:06.803
Story of a true
aristocratic dynasty

31:06.804 --> 31:08.938
Going back 500 years.

31:08.939 --> 31:13.142
- Yeah, the glamour and majesty
were intoxicating.

31:13.143 --> 31:16.045
I'm ready to try and help.

31:16.046 --> 31:18.314
- [speaks in native language]

31:20.450 --> 31:24.153
[clears throat]
how will you help?

31:24.154 --> 31:26.055
As you know now,

31:26.056 --> 31:27.890
I've spoken
to leading researchers

31:27.891 --> 31:32.228
And scientists from--ha--
sao paulo, singapore,

31:32.229 --> 31:36.899
Tel aviv, geesthacht,
beijing, sydney...

31:36.900 --> 31:38.367
Minnesota.

31:38.368 --> 31:43.773
You name the place,
I've flown there with hope

31:43.774 --> 31:45.808
And come back empty-handed.

31:45.809 --> 31:48.711
- You've spoken to an awful lot
of experts, boris.

31:48.712 --> 31:49.945
But as far as I can tell,

31:49.946 --> 31:52.014
None of them have spoken
to each other.

31:52.015 --> 31:54.417
See, what you're missing,
I believe,

31:54.418 --> 31:56.919
Is a global perspective.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.854
Someone to examine
the big picture

31:58.855 --> 32:02.024
And, I hope,
tie it all together.

32:02.025 --> 32:05.161
With your permission, I'd like
to start making some calls,

32:05.162 --> 32:07.062
Talking to these doctors
and researchers

32:07.063 --> 32:09.298
And asking some questions.

32:09.299 --> 32:12.401
And I'd like to do so
as your primary care physician.

32:12.402 --> 32:15.103
Your quarterback.

32:15.104 --> 32:17.873
- Quarterback?

32:20.376 --> 32:23.111
Well, where will you start,
quarterback?

32:23.112 --> 32:25.313
- At the beginning.

32:25.314 --> 32:29.851
Dr. Marisa casseras
of havana hospital.

32:31.120 --> 32:36.090
Think about it.
Let me know.

32:39.061 --> 32:40.995
- Luigi.

32:45.467 --> 32:47.067
That's all.

32:47.068 --> 32:49.103
- Just trust me.

32:49.104 --> 32:50.237
You won't even know I'm here.

32:50.238 --> 32:51.438
- Unlikely.

32:51.439 --> 32:52.973
- Just want to pitch him
my infomercial,

32:52.974 --> 32:56.876
Very discreetly, and, uh...

32:56.877 --> 33:00.146
That's weird. Hmm.

33:00.147 --> 33:02.782
Still can't believe it.

33:02.783 --> 33:04.183
- Selling a state-of-the-art
panini maker

33:04.184 --> 33:05.418
Can buy you a house
like this?

33:05.419 --> 33:06.953
- No, that you're engaged.

33:06.954 --> 33:10.323
- Thanks for the reminder.

33:10.324 --> 33:14.360
- Look, I know that parents
can put their own interests

33:14.361 --> 33:17.096
Ahead of what's best
for their kids.

33:17.097 --> 33:18.397
But that's the beauty
of an engagement,

33:18.398 --> 33:19.965
Is it's open-ended.

33:19.966 --> 33:23.836
It's not too late
till you set a date.

33:23.837 --> 33:27.139
- The wedding's in 60 days.

33:27.140 --> 33:30.509
- Oh.
Yeah, you're screwed.

33:30.510 --> 33:32.244
I'm kidding. Kind of.

33:32.245 --> 33:37.717
- [wincing and grunting]

33:37.718 --> 33:40.186
- Okay, call hank.
Then call 911.

33:40.187 --> 33:42.889
- Help me. God, help me.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.671
- Hey.
- The emts are five minutes out.

33:50.672 --> 33:54.006
101 over 49
and a pulse of 113.

33:54.007 --> 33:56.574
- Okay. Multiple wide-bore lines
of saline.

33:56.575 --> 33:57.709
Spencer, on a scale
from 1-10,

33:57.710 --> 33:59.177
Tell me
what your pain level is.

33:59.178 --> 34:00.544
- We're gonna need
a bigger scale.

34:00.545 --> 34:01.712
- Dude, the door
is crushing him.

34:01.713 --> 34:03.313
- We made the observation,
evan.

34:03.314 --> 34:04.614
- Uh, so why don't we just
try to open it?

34:04.615 --> 34:06.382
- No, no, no!

34:06.383 --> 34:08.217
The pressure of the door
is what's keeping him alive.

34:08.217 --> 34:09.985
- What?
- It's acting as a tourniquet.

34:09.985 --> 34:11.954
If we release it now,
he could bleed out internally.

34:11.955 --> 34:15.024
- Okay. Right.
Okay, tourniquet. Yeah.

34:15.025 --> 34:16.692
- Okay, weak and very fast.

34:16.693 --> 34:19.328
- Hey.
- I know, pal.

34:19.329 --> 34:22.364
You're not really a spaz.
- [laughs, spasms]

34:22.364 --> 34:23.666
- What is--what is--what--

34:23.667 --> 34:25.067
- He's going
into hemorrhagic shock.

34:25.068 --> 34:26.469
- Okay, so am I.

34:26.469 --> 34:27.670
Now I know why they call it
a panic room.

34:27.670 --> 34:29.505
Where the hell are those emts?

34:29.505 --> 34:31.172
- It's gonna be okay, buddy.
It's gonna be okay.

34:31.174 --> 34:32.375
Some bronchi
at the base of the right

34:32.376 --> 34:33.543
Near impact side.

34:33.543 --> 34:34.710
Can you reach
the pedal pulses?

34:34.712 --> 34:36.112
- I can't get past his knees.

34:36.112 --> 34:37.313
- All right.
Try for the popliteals.

34:37.315 --> 34:40.150
- Okay.
- [crying]

34:40.150 --> 34:42.252
- Okay, buddy. It's okay.

34:44.420 --> 34:46.985
- Okay, stronger on the right
than the left,

34:46.987 --> 34:49.681
But both very weak.

34:55.254 --> 34:59.957
- Spencer, we'll be right back.
One second.

34:59.958 --> 35:01.325
Major laceration.

35:01.326 --> 35:03.059
Helps exain the hypotension
d tachycardia.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.427
- I figured it was only
internal bleeding.

35:04.428 --> 35:06.029
- Fluids will only go so far.

35:06.030 --> 35:07.430
Eventually he'll bleed out
his own supply

35:07.431 --> 35:08.631
And then bleed out the saline

35:08.632 --> 35:10.366
Faster than we can pump it
in him.

35:10.367 --> 35:12.100
- And if we open the door,
he'll die even faster.

35:12.101 --> 35:13.668
- Mm-hmm.

35:13.669 --> 35:17.370
- If only we could take him
to the hospital like this.

35:17.371 --> 35:20.707
[footsteps approach]

35:20.708 --> 35:22.642
- Jesus.
How can we help, doc?

35:22.643 --> 35:24.377
- All right, we need
more saline,

35:24.378 --> 35:26.078
We need the stretcher ready,

35:26.079 --> 35:27.546
And then we need to haul ass
to hamptons heritage.

35:27.547 --> 35:29.148
As soon as we open that door,

35:29.149 --> 35:30.416
It'll be a scoop and run
against the clock.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.050
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:32.051 --> 35:35.153
- Hank, even racing down
an empty montauk highway,

35:35.154 --> 35:36.620
How will we ever make it
that far in time?

35:36.621 --> 35:38.421
- With a little luck,

35:38.422 --> 35:40.123
All we'll need is some help
from jill's basement

35:40.124 --> 35:43.158
Full of useless antiques.

35:45.262 --> 35:48.334
- As I stated previously,
I did not terminate dr. Casey.

35:48.335 --> 35:50.970
- This formal complaint,
mrs. Casey,

35:50.971 --> 35:52.438
Is not just about the loss

35:52.439 --> 35:55.107
Of another respected
e.R. Doctor.

35:55.108 --> 35:56.308
- What's it about then?

35:56.309 --> 35:58.143
- We want
to offer you a chance

35:58.144 --> 36:03.048
To keep this review
off your record.

36:03.049 --> 36:05.284
- By tendering my resignation?

36:05.285 --> 36:07.620
- By avoiding
an ugly proceeding.

36:07.621 --> 36:10.623
[cell phone ringing]

36:13.260 --> 36:15.361
- Well, I appreciate
your concern

36:15.362 --> 36:17.263
For my resume, dr. Blair,
but I assure--

36:17.264 --> 36:20.432
[cell phone buzzes]

36:20.433 --> 36:25.670
I'm sorry.
I need to excuse myself.

36:25.671 --> 36:30.608
- What could be more important
than saving her job?

36:30.609 --> 36:32.543
- According to inventory,
we do have one.

36:32.544 --> 36:38.315
But the last time it was used,
I was in junior high.

36:38.316 --> 36:41.352
Okay. It's got to be
in here somewhere.

36:41.353 --> 36:42.653
What does it look like?

36:42.654 --> 36:44.622
- It should say "m.A.S.T."
on the side.

36:44.623 --> 36:46.457
M-a-s--
- got it.

36:46.458 --> 36:49.259
- Great. Who's the fastest
driver at your hospital?

36:52.998 --> 36:58.136
Let's see.

36:58.137 --> 37:00.438
- We're saving him
using mc hammer memorabilia?

37:00.439 --> 37:02.374
- They're inflatable trousers.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.443
They were developed
by the military in the '60s.

37:04.444 --> 37:06.111
They'll he stabilize his b.P.

37:06.112 --> 37:07.579
While we transport him
to heritage.

37:07.580 --> 37:11.416
- Agh!
- Hank, 90 over 40. 125.

37:11.417 --> 37:13.251
- Open up all ivs,
crank up the fluids,

37:13.252 --> 37:15.720
And give him 2-milligram boluses
of morphine every five minutes.

37:15.721 --> 37:17.421
Push it slowly.

37:17.422 --> 37:19.156
- I just found a shortcut
to route 27.

37:19.157 --> 37:20.358
It should shave,
like, three minutes

37:20.359 --> 37:21.593
Off our problem.

37:21.594 --> 37:22.694
- No, no,
it's a summer Saturday.

37:22.695 --> 37:24.429
Route 27 is our problem.

37:24.430 --> 37:25.963
I'll go see what else we can do
to buy some time.

37:25.964 --> 37:27.531
- Okay.

37:27.532 --> 37:30.067
We're ready to open the door
and move spencer now.

37:30.068 --> 37:31.636
- Okay. Yeah,
you, me, and the 911 beefcakes

37:31.637 --> 37:33.671
Are gonna heave that door
right off and [claps hands].

37:33.672 --> 37:35.072
- Evan, the door
is six inches thick

37:35.073 --> 37:36.340
And weighs 800 pounds.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.675
The front line
of the new york jets

37:37.676 --> 37:39.177
Couldn't open it
with bare hands.

37:39.178 --> 37:41.146
- Okay. So...

37:41.147 --> 37:43.315
- Fortunately, there's a big,
green, release button

37:43.316 --> 37:44.549
Inside the panic room.

37:44.550 --> 37:46.117
- No way.

37:46.118 --> 37:48.052
I--I'm not physically qualified
for that, hank.

37:48.053 --> 37:49.653
Look at me.

37:49.654 --> 37:51.656
If that door snapped shut
on my frail and slender body--

37:51.657 --> 37:53.391
- Don't worry.

37:53.392 --> 37:55.226
As a precaution, I ordered
a second pair of trousers

37:55.227 --> 37:57.128
In your favorite color:
Salmon.

37:57.129 --> 37:59.130
- This is revenge
for the dad thing isn't it?

37:59.131 --> 38:00.665
- Not even a little bit.

38:00.666 --> 38:03.134
But if you're looking
for a way out of the dhouse...

38:03.135 --> 38:06.237
- I might find it
through that door.

38:06.238 --> 38:07.705
- You can do it.
- [grunts]

38:07.706 --> 38:11.241
- Sorry, buddy.
All right.

38:11.242 --> 38:12.242
All right.
- Here we go.

38:12.243 --> 38:13.609
- Push me.
- All right.

38:13.610 --> 38:15.911
All right.

38:15.912 --> 38:18.046
- [grunting] oh, god.
- You got it?

38:18.047 --> 38:19.180
- Oh, my god. Yes.
Push. Push.

38:19.181 --> 38:23.050
- You got it?
- Oh, yeah.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.351
- You okay in here?
- Yeah, I'm good.

38:24.352 --> 38:25.618
I'm just counting extremities.

38:25.619 --> 38:27.420
Okay. Yeah. I'm all right.
Okay.

38:30.557 --> 38:34.192
- It's worng.
- Okay. Guys, on three.

38:34.193 --> 38:36.027
Evan, on three.

38:36.028 --> 38:37.495
- On three or, like,
right after the?

38:37.496 --> 38:41.598
- Whatever. 1, 2, 3.

38:43.503 --> 38:46.676
Get in there.
Turn him over.

38:46.677 --> 38:48.616
Okay.

38:48.617 --> 38:51.052
Let's get his oulders.

38:51.053 --> 38:52.921
Let's get him over there.

38:52.922 --> 38:54.656
Down. Down. Good.

38:58.227 --> 39:01.161
- Okay, b.P.'s in freefall.
- Okay. Trauma shears.

39:06.535 --> 39:10.104
Hemcon bandage.

39:10.105 --> 39:11.539
The chitosan in the gauze
will adhere

39:11.540 --> 39:14.275
To the red blood cells
and form a tight clot

39:14.276 --> 39:15.676
Very quickly.

39:15.677 --> 39:19.146
- How quickly?
- That quick enough for you?

39:19.147 --> 39:23.617
Gauze. Tape.

39:23.618 --> 39:26.587
All right, now we ap
and velcro the trousers.

39:26.588 --> 39:29.523
Here we go

39:32.093 --> 39:34.995
Abdominal belt. Good.

39:34.996 --> 39:37.964
Okay, ate.

39:37.965 --> 39:41.567
[pants inflating]

39:41.568 --> 39:43.402
Careful not to puncture
the suit with anything sharp.

39:43.403 --> 39:46.972
We don't have a backup.

39:46.973 --> 39:48.307
- Okay, pressure's stopped
dropping.

39:48.308 --> 39:50.142
70 over palp.
- Okay, it's working.

39:50.143 --> 39:51.678
Slow down the fluids.

39:51.679 --> 39:54.314
150 ccs per hour
and four more of morphine.

39:54.315 --> 39:56.049
- How long will this thing
keep him stable for?

39:56.050 --> 39:58.485
- Let's not find out.
- All right.

39:58.486 --> 40:00.320
- Hi, there.
Could you grab this corner?

40:00.321 --> 40:02.523
All right, guys,
let's get him in there.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.494
This is all the help
you could scare up?

40:06.495 --> 40:07.695
Where's everyone else?

40:07.696 --> 40:09.329
- Sealing off montauk highway
for us.

40:09.330 --> 40:10.696
- Ready to go, doc.
- Nice.

40:10.697 --> 40:14.333
[sirens blaring]

40:23.475 --> 40:25.176
- Coming through.

40:25.177 --> 40:27.911
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell is this?

40:27.912 --> 40:29.545
- It's an emergency,
dr. Blair.

40:29.546 --> 40:33.047
- Untangle these, please.
- And you would be dr. Lawson.

40:33.048 --> 40:34.548
- I am. And you are...?

40:34.549 --> 40:36.116
- Amongst my other duties,

40:36.117 --> 40:38.118
I am now acting chief
of emergency services.

40:38.119 --> 40:41.020
So I'll take it from here.
- Perfect.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.688
Just pull the plugs
to deflate.

40:42.689 --> 40:44.957
Oh, and make sure you don't miss
any bleeding vessels

40:44.958 --> 40:46.224
During embolization

40:46.225 --> 40:47.425
Otherwise you'll be pulling
the plug

40:47.426 --> 40:48.592
On more than just the suit.

40:48.593 --> 40:50.094
He's all yours.

40:50.095 --> 40:52.329
- Maybe you'd better
come with us.

40:52.330 --> 40:54.130
- Maybe I'd better.
- Great.

40:54.131 --> 40:57.600
- Let's go, guys. Move it.
- Careful, careful, careful.

40:59.636 --> 41:01.570
- Nice job back there.

41:01.571 --> 41:06.041
- Yeah? You too.

41:06.042 --> 41:08.578
- Do you want to talk
about him?

41:08.579 --> 41:10.179
- About spencer?

41:10.180 --> 41:13.616
- Eddie r.

41:13.617 --> 41:17.753
- Ugh. It's just--
it's complicated family stuff.

41:17.754 --> 41:21.591
- Yeah? What would I know
about that?

41:27.398 --> 41:30.599
- All right.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.400
[exhales] I started talking
to my dad again

41:32.401 --> 41:35.303
About a year ago.

41:35.304 --> 41:37.305
He called me
on my 30th birthday.

41:37.306 --> 41:39.373
And I hadn't talked to him
in 20 years, mind you.

41:39.374 --> 41:41.209
Know what the first thing
he said to me was?

41:41.210 --> 41:45.646
- What?
- "how's hank?"

41:45.647 --> 41:49.116
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

41:49.117 --> 41:52.119
That's just how he's started
every conversation since.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.255
"how's hank?"

41:55.924 --> 41:57.425
[exhales]

41:57.426 --> 41:59.126
Hmm.

41:59.127 --> 42:02.630
I guess I really needed
to tell someone that.

42:02.631 --> 42:04.632
- It says a lot about
your father.

42:04.633 --> 42:06.400
- Yeah, it says a lot
about my brother.

42:06.401 --> 42:09.236
- But it says the most
about you.

42:09.237 --> 42:13.607
- Yeah? What does it say
exactly?

42:13.608 --> 42:17.578
- That you're caught between
your rock and your hard place.

42:17.579 --> 42:19.113
[sighs]

42:19.114 --> 42:21.548
And rather than just trying
to squirm out,

42:21.549 --> 42:23.450
You've been trying to make
everything fit together

42:23.451 --> 42:25.719
Comfortably again.

42:29.324 --> 42:34.328
- I guess I really needed
someone to tell me that.

42:34.329 --> 42:36.063
- Well, don't let it go
to your head.

42:36.064 --> 42:38.298
- I'm--what?
[chuckles]

42:38.299 --> 42:41.234
[cell phone chimes]

42:41.235 --> 42:43.670
How fast can you get me back
to change?

42:43.671 --> 42:46.273
I have an important meeting
with a young heiress.

42:46.274 --> 42:50.209
- It's nice to have you back.
- Well, you know...

42:50.210 --> 42:52.645
- Am I gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

42:52.646 --> 42:54.413
And not just
in the short term.

42:54.414 --> 42:55.414
I was thinking about it.

42:55.415 --> 42:57.017
One of the chemicals

42:57.018 --> 42:59.185
Jill found in your dad's lab
was mercury.

42:59.186 --> 43:01.054
That's why he had
all those old thermostats

43:01.055 --> 43:02.522
Lying around.

43:02.523 --> 43:05.124
He probably used the mercury
to manipulate the gold

43:05.125 --> 43:06.926
For some of his experiments.

43:06.927 --> 43:08.795
- He was building
a next generation robot

43:08.796 --> 43:10.163
Operated by the internet.

43:10.164 --> 43:12.465
- Which sounds incredibly cool.

43:12.466 --> 43:14.901
Unfortunately,
when inhaled in large doses,

43:14.902 --> 43:16.369
Over long periods of time,

43:16.370 --> 43:19.505
Mercury can cause psychosis.

43:21.475 --> 43:26.946
And kidney failure.

43:26.947 --> 43:29.181
- So it wasn't
the mental illness

43:29.182 --> 43:31.216
That sent my dad
into that room?

43:31.217 --> 43:35.588
- No. It was the other way
around.

43:35.589 --> 43:39.459
That's why he grew increasingly
paranoid and distant.

43:39.460 --> 43:41.327
And in smaller doses,

43:41.328 --> 43:45.498
Exposure can lead to headaches,
fatigue, tingling sensations,

43:45.499 --> 43:48.468
Sleeplessness, and...

43:48.469 --> 43:50.002
Incoordination.

43:50.003 --> 43:53.238
- Or in layman's terms,
spaz-ticity.

43:53.239 --> 43:56.475
- Yes. Spaz-ticity.

43:56.476 --> 44:00.178
- So I really am gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

44:00.179 --> 44:01.246
As long as you hire
a contractor

44:01.247 --> 44:02.947
For all future renovation.

44:02.948 --> 44:05.650
- Yes, doctor.

44:34.314 --> 44:37.450
- So I can contact
dr. Casseras.

44:37.451 --> 44:39.218
- You can give it
your best shot.

44:39.219 --> 44:40.586
- Okay.

44:40.587 --> 44:43.689
- If you reach her,

44:43.690 --> 44:46.359
Tell her, when I look
at the roses,

44:46.360 --> 44:49.262
I think of cristobal square.

44:49.263 --> 44:51.664
She'll know what it means.

44:51.665 --> 44:54.300
Hank.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.509
Bye.

45:19.193 --> 45:22.361
- Oh, I...I really hope
she's good to you.

45:22.362 --> 45:23.728
- I'm sure she will be.

45:23.729 --> 45:27.996
- I was talking
to the car.

45:31.569 --> 45:33.236
Bye.

45:35.139 --> 45:38.642
- What's with the johnny cash
fashion tribute?

45:38.643 --> 45:42.579
- I'm in mourning, henrietta.

45:42.580 --> 45:46.116
I just sold the only valuable
thing I've ever owned.

45:46.117 --> 45:48.118
- Aw. Well,
look on the bright side,

45:48.119 --> 45:50.620
Since you got it for free,
you cashed out at 100% profit.

45:50.621 --> 45:53.223
- One could argue that I timed
the market perfectly then.

45:53.224 --> 45:56.493
- One could indeed.

45:56.494 --> 45:58.161
One could also argue
you've begun to repent

45:58.162 --> 45:59.996
For your sin.

45:59.997 --> 46:04.267
- Ha. I don't know, I think sin
is a slight exaggeration.

46:04.268 --> 46:08.538
- Really?
I think it's an understatement.

46:12.443 --> 46:18.148
- Shall we agree to disagree?
- Like we always do.

46:21.085 --> 46:23.620
- So is spencer the spaz
gonna be all right or what?

46:23.621 --> 46:26.557
- Yeah. Turns out not so spastic
after all.

46:26.558 --> 46:29.226
Yeah, the problem
was mercury poisoning.

46:29.227 --> 46:30.695
- I thought
it was that giant door

46:30.696 --> 46:32.263
Slicing into him
like a pinata.

46:32.264 --> 46:36.634
- No, I meant--never mind.
Go deep.

46:38.536 --> 46:41.672
Deeper.
- Like old times. All right.

46:41.673 --> 46:43.907
- Deeper!

47:19.911 --> 47:24.414
- Hey, kiddo. Look at you.

47:26.751 --> 47:28.051
What?

47:31.188 --> 47:34.624
All right, so it took
a little longer than I thought.

47:34.625 --> 47:38.461
Still the same shade
of green, huh?
