Whoa!
It's all so real!

00:42.250 --> 00:44.040
This is amazing!

00:44.166 --> 00:45.874
It's like I'm there!

00:46.000 --> 00:48.040
I see all our friends
at school!

00:48.166 --> 00:49.582
Oh, wow!

00:49.708 --> 00:52.707
If I hold up my hands,
I can see them, too!

00:52.833 --> 00:54.874
Whoa!

00:55.000 --> 00:58.665
Wow! You were right!
I can actually feel it!

00:58.791 --> 01:00.374
Butters, what the hell
are you doing?

01:00.500 --> 01:02.749
I feel Stan!
He looks totally real!

01:02.875 --> 01:03.874
That's awesome, Butters.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.665
Keep making your way
down the hallway.

01:05.791 --> 01:07.040
Your vital signs
are looking good.

01:07.166 --> 01:08.999
What do you see now?

01:09.125 --> 01:10.207
More of the school.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.290
What are you doing,
Butters?

01:11.416 --> 01:12.749
The school and all the kids.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.040
I still can't hear any sound
except for your voice.

01:15.166 --> 01:16.999
Yeah, they haven't worked out
the audio yet, but --

01:17.125 --> 01:19.290
He's so fucking stupid.

01:19.416 --> 01:20.665
But I'm sure they will soon.

01:20.791 --> 01:22.665
Ah. Okay.
I think I'm done, Eric.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.499
I-I'm feeling kind of dizzy,
and, uh --

01:24.625 --> 01:26.499
- Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
- What?! What?! What?!

01:26.625 --> 01:27.790
What did I tell you
about removing the headset

01:27.916 --> 01:29.249
when you're not back
at the access hub?

01:29.375 --> 01:30.832
Oh, yeah,
that it would split my neurons

01:30.958 --> 01:32.415
and scramble my brains --
I forgot!

01:32.541 --> 01:34.540
You forgot your neurons
would be torn apart?

01:34.666 --> 01:36.999
Did you also forget that
if you die in virtual reality,

01:37.125 --> 01:38.415
you die in real life,
Butters?

01:38.541 --> 01:39.249
I'm sorry!

01:39.375 --> 01:40.665
You need find your way back
to my room.

01:40.791 --> 01:42.124
- Can you do that?
- Yeah!

01:42.250 --> 01:44.124
We only have 8 minutes before
the battery protocols die.

01:44.250 --> 01:47.249
- You have to hurry!
- Oh, Jesus!

01:54.208 --> 01:56.290
Okay.
I'm back in your room!

01:56.416 --> 01:58.165
All right, Butters,
sit down at the computer.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.540
Now drop the stafernasy window.
We're just gonna make it.

02:00.666 --> 02:02.790
Stafernasy window dropped!

02:07.333 --> 02:09.582
Welcome back, dude.

02:09.708 --> 02:12.124
Wow!
That was cool.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.624
How do you feel?
Do you feel okay?

02:13.750 --> 02:15.457
I touched Wendy's boob.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.540
And then -- And then he --
he took of the shop goggles,

02:19.666 --> 02:21.374
and he was all like,
"Whoa, I'm back!"

02:21.500 --> 02:23.415
Damn it if it's not
the awesomest thing ever!

02:23.541 --> 02:25.040
Sounds pretty typical to me.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.124
Come on, guys.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.540
This is the "cure de gars"
of Butters torture.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.874
- "Coup de grâce," Cartman.
- Thank you, Kyle.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.665
Poor Butters.
Can't you just leave him alone?

02:32.791 --> 02:33.957
Dude, Butters is an asshole,

02:34.083 --> 02:36.165
and he deserves to be taken down
once in a while, okay?

02:36.291 --> 02:38.040
Hey, Eric! What did you say
to the principal

02:38.166 --> 02:39.082
for missing first period?

02:39.208 --> 02:41.124
Not that we were doing
anything interesting.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.207
Right, Eric?

02:42.333 --> 02:43.540
Yeah, I just told her
I was running late

02:43.666 --> 02:44.624
and it won't happen again.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.624
You know what I said?

02:45.750 --> 02:46.832
She asked me
why I wasn't in school,

02:46.958 --> 02:49.624
and I said, "Well, technically,
I was at school."

02:49.750 --> 02:50.457
Tee hee!

02:50.583 --> 02:52.832
Sorry, guys, but Eric and I know
a little something you don't.

02:52.958 --> 02:54.499
Not that it's anything
that cool.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.082
- Right, Eric?
- Right, Butters.

02:56.208 --> 02:59.207
- These guys are so dumb, huh?
- Yeah!

02:59.333 --> 03:01.290
See? He's an asshole.
Fuck him.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.832
Each time you go
into the virtual world,

03:05.958 --> 03:07.624
it becomes
more and more dangerous.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.957
Are you absolutely sure
you want to do this, Butters?

03:10.083 --> 03:11.874
Well, not 100%.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.290
Even 10% is good enough.
Here you go.

03:16.541 --> 03:18.082
Okay.
Subject is ready.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.415
All right, Butters, I'm booting
up the core competency now.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.540
Edifice framework is online.
Vital signs appear to be normal.

03:24.666 --> 03:27.457
- Interim status?
- Interim status is go!

03:28.500 --> 03:30.749
Digital malcontent
now at parameter Alpha.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.874
Prepare for full graphic
interfaces on my mark.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.249
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, mark.

03:39.666 --> 03:40.999
It worked!
I'm back in!

03:41.125 --> 03:42.165
All systems normal!

03:42.291 --> 03:44.415
All right, Butters, behind you,
you should see the door.

03:44.541 --> 03:45.624
Go through it
and head outside.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.624
Going now!

03:51.416 --> 03:53.457
Everything looks good, Butters.
You're doing great.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.124
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

04:04.541 --> 04:06.707
How much more of this
am I supposed to clear up?

04:06.833 --> 04:07.707
You're doing great.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.290
Almost done with this level,
Butters.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.707
Just make sure
you've cleared the driveway

04:10.833 --> 04:12.290
and, uh, walkway
of all the virtual snow.

04:12.416 --> 04:14.624
Okay!
It's so realistic!

04:14.750 --> 04:16.499
The snow looks kind of fake,
though.

04:19.958 --> 04:21.957
All right,
I think that's all of it!

04:22.083 --> 04:23.957
Okay, nice, Butters.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.999
Um, now go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.874
This is the part
where you collect the money.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.332
There's a old fat lady here!

04:30.458 --> 04:31.624
She's holding out money
for me!

04:31.750 --> 04:33.540
Just take the money,
Butters.

04:33.666 --> 04:34.957
Okay, I got it!

04:35.083 --> 04:36.332
You got the money?
Okay, great, Butters.

04:36.458 --> 04:37.665
Now get back
to the access point.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.749
Already? Aw, no!

04:39.875 --> 04:42.165
Yeah, Butters. The discrepancy
bars are oscillating.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.082
You need to, uh, come back.

04:44.208 --> 04:47.207
Are you heading back, Butters?

04:47.333 --> 04:49.374
Butters?

04:49.500 --> 04:50.582
All right, Butters,
you should get back

04:50.708 --> 04:51.582
to the access point now.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.582
You're going off grid.

04:52.708 --> 04:53.582
I'm sorry, Eric,

04:53.708 --> 04:57.082
but there's just one thing
I got to do real quick.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.207
There you are, mister!

05:02.333 --> 05:03.957
Just what do you think
you're doing?

05:04.083 --> 05:05.499
Hello, Dad!
It's me -- Butters!

05:05.625 --> 05:06.790
I know that.
What are you --

05:06.916 --> 05:09.207
This is for all the times
I got grounded.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.665
Ohh!

05:10.791 --> 05:11.707
Ooh! Ooh!

05:11.833 --> 05:14.749
Ha! I could almost feel
his balls on my fist!

05:14.875 --> 05:16.457
How'd you like that, Dad?

05:16.583 --> 05:18.915
Butters, why?!
Oh, my God!

05:19.041 --> 05:20.415
That was incredible!

05:20.541 --> 05:22.499
Uh, Butters, uh, get back
to the access point now.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.915
I feel amazing!

05:25.041 --> 05:27.832
I'm back outside now!
I'm a bad man!

05:27.958 --> 05:28.832
You hear me?!

05:28.958 --> 05:30.624
Take that, you stupid cars!

05:32.416 --> 05:33.957
What the hell
are you doing, kid?!

05:34.083 --> 05:36.165
Butters, it's, uh, time to stop.
Get back to my place.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.040
Who's the man now?!
I'm gonna take his car!

05:39.166 --> 05:40.290
This is like
Grand Theft Auto!

05:40.416 --> 05:41.540
Hey!

05:41.666 --> 05:43.749
Whoa!
I'm in the car now!

05:43.875 --> 05:45.832
Oh, shit.

05:45.958 --> 05:48.082
Butters, Butters,
where are you now?

05:48.208 --> 05:50.082
I'm in the bad part of town!

05:50.208 --> 05:52.540
I just hit a lamppost!
I'm back on my feet.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.790
Oh! Oh, that's cool.
There's a prostitute out here.

05:54.916 --> 05:56.749
Okay, Butters,
let's call it good, okay?

05:56.875 --> 05:58.582
I'm gonna beat her up
and take her money!

05:58.708 --> 05:59.582
Wait.
Hang on, Butters.

05:59.708 --> 06:01.082
Take that, you dumb hooker!

06:01.208 --> 06:02.374
What you doin',
motherfucker?!

06:02.500 --> 06:03.499
I'm taking your money!

06:03.625 --> 06:06.207
Ow. Oh, she stabbed me.
Uh, the hooker stabbed me.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.374
Butters, get back to my room.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.249
The veracrosses
are destabilizing.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.290
I can't --
I can't breathe too good, Eric.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.707
I can't see.
Are you still there?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.582
Oh.
I think I overdid it.

06:17.708 --> 06:18.957
I got to take
this thing off.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.999
What the hell --
What hell is that?!

06:21.125 --> 06:22.290
Aaaah!

06:22.416 --> 06:24.665
Butters? Butters?

06:27.875 --> 06:29.415
You're very lucky,
young man.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.290
You've got a couple
hairline fractures,

06:31.416 --> 06:33.915
but the knife missed your spleen
by half an inch.

06:34.041 --> 06:37.082
I -- I d-didn't think a knife
could really hurt me.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.124
I thought I was just
in a virtual reality.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.749
No, you actually got stabbed
by a hooker.

06:41.875 --> 06:44.082
We've called your parents,
and they're on their way.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.540
Your dad wanted me
to let you know

06:45.666 --> 06:48.332
that you're grounded more
than you can possibly imagine.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.332
Aw, nuts!

06:49.458 --> 06:50.957
Try and relax,
and when your parents get here,

06:51.083 --> 06:52.749
we'll sort this all out.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.249
Wonder how long
I'm grounded for.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.707
Butters.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.374
- Aah!
- Are you okay?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.165
Eric!
What are you doing here?

07:03.291 --> 07:05.457
- I'm not here, Butters.
- What?

07:05.583 --> 07:07.249
This is going to be hard
to understand, Butters,

07:07.375 --> 07:09.499
but you've become trapped
in the simulation.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.457
None of this is real.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.790
Nunh-unh!

07:14.916 --> 07:15.790
Yeah-huh.

07:15.916 --> 07:17.499
I told you
never to take the headset off

07:17.625 --> 07:18.832
outside the access point,
didn't I?

07:18.958 --> 07:20.332
We're actually both
at my house right now.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.332
You're wearing the headset,

07:21.458 --> 07:23.082
and I'm talking to you
as a computer program.

07:23.208 --> 07:26.457
That's why I can
manipulate reality.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.082
What?!

07:31.583 --> 07:35.749
You see, in this world,
things aren't what they seem.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.290
Aah! Okay, stop! Stop!

07:38.416 --> 07:39.707
Listen to me carefully,
Butters.

07:39.833 --> 07:41.540
The Oculus compromise
has been streamlined.

07:41.666 --> 07:43.707
You can't trust anyone
in this reality.

07:43.833 --> 07:45.832
Say nothing to no one
about the Oculus Rift.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.040
If you think they know,
they will kill you.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.165
How do you know that?

07:49.291 --> 07:50.290
How would I know
that the nurse

07:50.416 --> 07:51.707
is about to walk through
that door?

07:53.291 --> 07:54.707
Everything okay in here?

07:54.833 --> 07:55.832
Aah!

07:55.958 --> 07:57.874
Yes!
Yes, everything's fine!

07:58.000 --> 07:59.832
Okay.

07:59.958 --> 08:01.249
- Butters.
- No!

08:01.375 --> 08:02.874
I'm gonna get you
back to reality, Butters,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.040
but you have to give me time.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.040
I've got to go.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.290
The Orion parameters
are embellishing.

08:06.416 --> 08:07.957
Just stay quiet.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.749
Aaaah!

08:16.208 --> 08:17.165
Well, are you happy,
Cartman?

08:17.291 --> 08:18.957
Butters is
completely traumatized.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.040
I'm happy that
I totally got away with it.

08:22.791 --> 08:24.790
What's a 911 area code?

08:24.916 --> 08:25.999
Hello?

08:26.125 --> 08:26.999
Hello, Eric.

08:27.125 --> 08:29.457
My name is Steve
from Oculus customer service.

08:29.583 --> 08:33.040
There seems to be an error
with our virtual headsets,

08:33.166 --> 08:34.249
and on behalf of the company,

08:34.375 --> 08:37.374
I would like to apologize
and try to help.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.374
With what?

08:38.500 --> 08:40.207
This is going to be
very jarring for you,

08:40.333 --> 08:42.165
but there's been
a malfunction

08:42.291 --> 08:43.999
with the headset
you ordered from us.

08:44.125 --> 08:46.999
Right now you're actually
in your room at your computer

08:47.125 --> 08:48.415
wearing an Oculus headset,

08:48.541 --> 08:52.124
but you're in a comalike trance,
my friend.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.040
Fu-u-ck you.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.249
I understand your shock,
my friend,

08:56.375 --> 08:59.207
but you have simply been
in the virtual world so long,

08:59.333 --> 09:00.207
you have forgotten.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.624
You should probably
listen to him, dude.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.540
Uh-huh. 'Cause I thought
I was messing with Butters,

09:03.666 --> 09:05.540
but I'm actually the one
trapped in virtual reality.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.374
The people you are talking to

09:07.500 --> 09:09.457
are just computer programs,
my friend.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.249
Guys, tell him you're not
computer programs.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.374
Maybe we are.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.374
Kyle, just don't be a dick
right now.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.874
I know this is
very hard for you,

09:19.000 --> 09:20.374
but we don't have
a lot of time.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.040
You really think
I'm that stupid,

09:22.166 --> 09:24.040
that I'd believe
all of this, all along,

09:24.166 --> 09:26.874
has been me living out some kind
of virtual-reality fantasy?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.540
Fuck you!

09:31.250 --> 09:34.374
Eric? Poopsiekins?

09:34.500 --> 09:36.499
Eric?

09:38.583 --> 09:40.665
Honey, maybe that's enough
computer time.

09:40.791 --> 09:42.790
It's been about 19 hours now.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.499
I know you said not to
disturb you with your new toy,

09:47.625 --> 09:49.999
but Mommy thought
maybe you needed to eat.

09:50.125 --> 09:53.499
All right,
I'll just leave it here, hon.

09:53.625 --> 09:57.082
I'm turning in for the night.
Mommy loves you.

09:58.958 --> 10:01.957
What kind of person
did we raise you to be?!

10:02.083 --> 10:04.749
You think this world is just
there for your amusement?!

10:04.875 --> 10:06.499
You are not
to leave this room,

10:06.625 --> 10:09.249
and you are not allowed
to use the phone or computer!

10:09.375 --> 10:10.665
Please!
You can't do that!

10:10.791 --> 10:12.332
I have to find a way
out of this!

10:12.458 --> 10:15.749
Oh, no, mister.
You are grounded!

10:23.375 --> 10:25.332
Are you fucking with me?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.165
What?
What do you mean?

10:27.291 --> 10:29.374
Butters, I'm seriously.
Are you fucking with me?

10:29.500 --> 10:30.624
I don't know
what you mean --

10:30.750 --> 10:33.165
Because if you are,
it's not cool.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.332
Eric, you said
you were gonna

10:34.458 --> 10:35.665
get me out of
this virtual world.

10:35.791 --> 10:37.540
Butters, I talked
to Oculus customer service,

10:37.666 --> 10:39.540
and they said I'm the one
who's wearing a headset

10:39.666 --> 10:41.457
and has forgotten
he's in virtual reality.

10:41.583 --> 10:43.249
Oh, really?
Oh, that's a relief.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.249
Oh, it's a relief, huh?
Well, guess what, Butters.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.999
If I'm the one trapped
in virtual reality,

10:47.125 --> 10:49.499
that means that you're nothing
but a computer program!

10:49.625 --> 10:50.790
- Oh, God!
- That's right!

10:50.875 --> 10:52.207
- Oh, God!
- That's right!

10:52.333 --> 10:53.790
Now, you better stop
messing around, Butters,

10:53.916 --> 10:54.915
so I can help you
out of this.

10:55.041 --> 10:56.832
Because you know how I said
if you die in virtual reality,

10:56.958 --> 10:57.832
you die in real life?

10:57.958 --> 10:58.499
Yeah.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.999
Well, if you get grounded
in virtual reality,

11:00.125 --> 11:03.374
you get grounded in real life,
too -- forever!

11:06.958 --> 11:08.499
Hello?

11:08.625 --> 11:11.624
Kyle, it's Butters.
I've been grounded!

11:11.750 --> 11:12.665
Again?

11:12.791 --> 11:14.332
No, no!
You don't understand!

11:14.458 --> 11:16.874
This time, I've been grounded
for no good reason.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.457
- I didn't do anything, Kyle.
- Uh-huh.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.624
I think there's something
supernatural going on.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.499
I asked my dad
why I was being grounded,

11:23.625 --> 11:26.290
and he said that for asking him,
that I was more grounded.

11:26.416 --> 11:27.707
It doesn't make sense!

11:27.833 --> 11:30.665
Butters, Butters, I'm -- I'm
kind of super busy right now.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.332
Please!
Just go to Cartman's house!

11:32.458 --> 11:33.624
I think the answer
might be within --

11:33.750 --> 11:35.124
Butters! Who is that?!

11:39.208 --> 11:41.540
Mrph! Mrph rmhmhm
rm mrph rmhmhm rm!

11:43.416 --> 11:46.165
Mrph rmh?
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

11:46.291 --> 11:47.624
Mrph rmhmhm
rm mrph rmhmhm!

11:47.750 --> 11:49.124
You found Cartman like this,

11:49.250 --> 11:51.332
and you think he's somehow
trapped in virtual reality?

11:51.458 --> 11:52.457
Mrph!

11:54.375 --> 11:55.999
Fu-u-ck you.

11:56.125 --> 11:56.999
Mrph?

11:57.125 --> 11:58.999
- Get up, Cartman.
- Mrph rmhmhm rm!

11:59.125 --> 12:00.790
Okay, then, let's take him
to the hospital.

12:00.916 --> 12:03.332
You hear that, fatso?
You're going to the hospital!

12:03.458 --> 12:05.124
Kyle, maybe this is for real.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.707
Fuck you
if you're in on this.

12:07.833 --> 12:10.207
In on what?

12:10.333 --> 12:12.790
Oh, fuck you.

12:12.916 --> 12:14.082
Yes, no, sorry.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.832
But because you bought
two business-class tickets,

12:15.958 --> 12:17.874
I cannot refund the fares.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.249
That's right.
There is nothing we can do.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.707
All right, have I answered
all your customer concerns

12:22.833 --> 12:24.082
in a timely, polite manner?

12:24.208 --> 12:26.665
Thank you for calling Korean
Airlines customer service.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.999
El Pollo Loco customer service.
This is Steve.

12:29.125 --> 12:32.207
Oh. Uh, we're trying to reach
Oculus customer service.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.290
Oh, yes.
Uh, yes, my friend.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.332
Oculus customer service.
This is Steve.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.249
Yeah, our friend had been
missing for a few days,

12:38.375 --> 12:39.540
so we went
and checked on him,

12:39.666 --> 12:41.207
and he's in a coma,
wearing your headset.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.332
Oh, yes, yes!

12:42.458 --> 12:44.665
- What is your name, please?
- Kyle.

12:44.791 --> 12:47.582
Kyle, I need to advise you
that this call may be recorded

12:47.708 --> 12:50.207
to help with better
customer service in the future.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.540
Is that agreeable to you?

12:51.666 --> 12:52.665
I don't care.

12:52.791 --> 12:55.165
He doesn't care!
I can continue!

12:55.291 --> 12:57.290
All right, listen
very carefully, my friend.

12:57.416 --> 13:00.332
The headset we sold you
are having some minor problems.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.874
You mean he's actually stuck
in virtual reality?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.332
Yes, and that is why

13:04.458 --> 13:06.999
we are trying to locate all
the headsets and do a recall.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.499
Do you understand?
It is a total recall.

13:10.625 --> 13:13.415
Fu-u-ck you.

13:13.541 --> 13:14.457
Fuck you what?

13:14.583 --> 13:16.749
He says they're doing
a total recall.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.082
Oh, fuck you.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.665
All right, did I take care
of all your customer needs

13:20.791 --> 13:22.832
in a timely and satisfactory
fashion today?

13:22.958 --> 13:24.540
You haven't done anything yet.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.915
But the customer service --
Was that reliable,

13:27.041 --> 13:29.082
and did I accurately
and politely respond

13:29.208 --> 13:30.290
to your concerns?

13:30.416 --> 13:32.374
We need help.
Our friend is in a coma.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.415
Uh, let's see.

13:33.541 --> 13:35.582
Uh, it looks like one of you

13:35.708 --> 13:37.249
is going to have to put on
the Oculus headset

13:37.375 --> 13:38.832
and go into the virtual world

13:38.958 --> 13:41.582
and convince your friend
to get to an access point.

13:41.708 --> 13:42.957
Could you try that, my friend?

13:48.708 --> 13:51.290
It's okay.
Everything is cool.

13:51.416 --> 13:52.624
Don't let anyone
mess with your head,

13:52.750 --> 13:53.999
and it's all gonna be fine.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.749
You're cool, Eric.
You're cool.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.415
Hey, Cartman.
I need to talk to you.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.915
I know.
Let's go to the backyard.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.624
Cartman, I'm going to
tell you something,

14:10.750 --> 14:14.040
and I need you to believe me,
even if it seems impossible.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.749
Okay, Kyle.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.624
All right, here it goes.

14:17.750 --> 14:21.082
Cartman,
you aren't really here.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.749
Mm.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.374
And why do you know that,
Kyle?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.915
Because I saw you, okay,
in your room,

14:27.041 --> 14:29.249
passed out
with a V.R. headset on.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.665
Customer service
said that one of us

14:30.791 --> 14:32.332
needed to put on the headset
and come get you,

14:32.458 --> 14:33.749
and that's why I'm here.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.790
Mm-hmm.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.749
I know it's hard to believe,
but you have to trust me.

14:38.875 --> 14:42.124
And why did the guys
send you, Kyle?

14:42.250 --> 14:43.165
What do you mean?

14:43.291 --> 14:44.874
Kyle, I want you
to brace yourself.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.665
This is going to be
extremely hard to believe,

14:46.791 --> 14:49.249
but you are the one
that's been in a coma

14:49.375 --> 14:50.832
with the V.R. headset on.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.749
Fuck you.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.249
I know it's hard
to grasp, Kyle,

14:54.375 --> 14:56.124
but I was the one sent
by customer service

14:56.250 --> 14:57.165
to try and convince you

14:57.291 --> 14:59.290
that none of what you've seen
is real.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.124
You bought
the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.624
Don't do that.

15:02.750 --> 15:03.832
- Calm down.
- No!

15:03.958 --> 15:05.665
I put your headset on
and came here to --

15:05.791 --> 15:07.540
In virtual reality,
yes, you did.

15:07.666 --> 15:09.999
No. Then I came
into this virtual space.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.832
You've been in the virtual space
all along, Kyle.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.999
Think about it.
We're archrivals.

15:14.125 --> 15:18.207
Why would the guys send you in
to convince me of anything?

15:18.333 --> 15:19.332
Fuck you.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.790
Why would they send you in
to convince me of anything?

15:23.625 --> 15:24.499
Fuck!

15:28.791 --> 15:31.582
Thanks for calling Best Buy.
How can I direct your call?

15:31.708 --> 15:33.249
Yes.
My name is Kyle Broflovski.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.832
Can you tell me if I purchased
an Oculus Rift headset there?

15:35.958 --> 15:36.665
Or if I did.

15:36.791 --> 15:39.040
Or if you sold one
to an Eric Cartman?

15:39.166 --> 15:40.915
I'm gonna have to connect you
to customer service.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.749
Hang on a sec.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.582
Best Buy customer service.
This is Steve.

15:48.791 --> 15:50.540
Dude. What?

15:50.666 --> 15:51.707
What? Hello?

15:51.833 --> 15:52.540
Yes, hello.

15:52.666 --> 15:53.665
This call may be recorded

15:53.791 --> 15:55.707
to ensure good customer service
in the future.

15:55.833 --> 15:59.165
Dude, now this is
getting weird.

16:03.916 --> 16:06.124
Well, this looks
like a lovely meal.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.499
Too bad Butters
won't be enjoying it.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.332
You hear that, mister?!
No dinner for you!

16:11.458 --> 16:14.957
While you're grounded,
you can just go to bed hungry!

16:15.083 --> 16:18.249
Linda, do you remember
why Butters is grounded?

16:18.375 --> 16:19.540
What -- What did he do?

16:19.666 --> 16:21.374
Oh, I don't know, Stephen.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.832
I let you handle
all the groundings.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.249
It's strange.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.332
I don't recall him really doing
anything particularly bad,

16:28.458 --> 16:31.082
and yet -- and yet
he is grounded.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.457
And no bouncing a racquetball,
either!

16:35.583 --> 16:38.915
No, listen, I called customer
service because I need help.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.499
What am I supposed to do?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.332
Wait. Stan?

16:42.458 --> 16:43.582
Hold on.

16:43.708 --> 16:46.415
Is this my virtual reality
or Cartman's virtual reality?

16:46.541 --> 16:47.415
It's neither.

16:47.541 --> 16:49.374
I know this might be hard
for you to grasp right now,

16:49.500 --> 16:51.999
but this is all
actually real.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.582
No, no, after we found Cartman,
I put the headset on and --

16:54.708 --> 16:57.999
No, dude, dude, we've all
been here the entire time.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.457
Holy shit.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.749
Then this is all real.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.790
We've all been here
from the beginning,

17:03.916 --> 17:05.832
taking turns
on the Oculus Rift headset.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.707
No, you guys,
this is virtual reality.

17:07.833 --> 17:08.832
How do you know?

17:08.958 --> 17:12.582
Because I'm a computer program.

17:12.708 --> 17:13.832
God damn it, Cartman.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.082
I'm telling you guys. I swear.
You have to believe me.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.540
I am a computer program.
I'm not real.

17:18.666 --> 17:19.540
He's lying.

17:19.666 --> 17:20.665
I'm not lying.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.915
Go ahead and ask
customer service.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.165
What was the name
of the person

17:24.291 --> 17:26.207
who first called you
for customer service?

17:26.333 --> 17:28.957
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
That I can answer.

17:29.083 --> 17:32.040
His name was Butters.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.832
Butters called
customer service first?

17:33.958 --> 17:35.290
Have I answered
all your questions

17:35.416 --> 17:37.124
in a satisfying
and courteous manner?

17:37.250 --> 17:39.457
Come on.
We're going to Butters' house.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.415
Hello? My friend?

17:41.541 --> 17:43.999
My friend, I believe we are
having some technical issues

17:44.125 --> 17:45.082
with our phone line.

17:45.208 --> 17:45.915
Please hang on.

17:46.041 --> 17:47.290
I'm going to call
customer service.

17:48.791 --> 17:50.874
Hello. Customer service.
This is Steve.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.332
Hello! This is Steve
with customer service.

17:54.458 --> 17:55.957
Uh, no, no, no, no, my friend.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.957
I am Steve
with customer service.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.249
Listen, my friend.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.332
This is going to be
very hard to comprehend,

18:01.458 --> 18:04.165
but none of what
you are seeing is real.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.415
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

18:07.541 --> 18:08.457
My friend,
my friend, my friend,

18:08.583 --> 18:12.207
a customer who was in virtual
reality called customer service,

18:12.333 --> 18:15.999
and it has created a
customer feedback loop, okay?

18:16.125 --> 18:20.624
Here in India, we call it
a customer feedback vindaloop.

18:20.750 --> 18:23.957
Oh, fuck you.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.374
No, no, no, no, no.
Do not fuck me because I am you,

18:26.500 --> 18:28.999
and then we will just
be fucking ourselves!

18:29.125 --> 18:31.665
Now, have I provided answers
to your questions

18:31.791 --> 18:33.749
in a courteous
and prompt fashion?

18:33.875 --> 18:35.749
What do you mean,

18:35.875 --> 18:37.499
have you answered
all my questions?

18:37.625 --> 18:39.915
No! You have not answered
any questions at all!

18:40.041 --> 18:41.749
No, no, no, no, no.
Listen. Listen.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.332
If I didn't answer
your questions,

18:43.458 --> 18:45.374
then we have given
bad customer service.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.457
But you didn't answer
any of my questions!

18:47.583 --> 18:49.040
Well, what is more important,
my friend --

18:49.166 --> 18:51.082
the result
or good customer service?

18:51.208 --> 18:55.082
♪ I'm troubled,
I'm troubled in mind ♪

18:55.208 --> 18:58.999
♪ If Jesus don't help me,
I surely will die ♪

18:59.125 --> 19:00.124
Butters!

19:00.250 --> 19:02.582
Ah! But you guys
can't be here.

19:02.708 --> 19:03.582
Why not?

19:03.708 --> 19:06.249
Because I'm grounded.
That means no visitors.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.874
Butters, when did you call
Oculus Rift customer service?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.457
When we were playing
with the Oculus headset.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.040
Don't you guys remember?

19:12.166 --> 19:13.374
We were all
messing around with it.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.457
I played with it first
and went a little nuts.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.665
I forgot I was in virtual
reality, and I got grounded.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.290
And now I'm grounded
in real life.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.374
So now we are
in the real world?

19:21.500 --> 19:22.082
Yes!

19:22.208 --> 19:24.832
You guys,
I have accepted the reality

19:24.958 --> 19:26.124
that I am just
a computer program.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.165
The fact is
that one of us right now
