WEBVTT

00:00.865 --> 00:03.666
Hurricane Zelda, now
a category two storm...

00:04.253 --> 00:07.635
- Oh, no, they just upgraded Zelda to a category two.
- I can't believe this is happening.

00:07.635 --> 00:10.323
All our plans, all our
preparations for this wedding

00:10.323 --> 00:12.930
could be ruined by a
hurricane named Zelda?

00:12.930 --> 00:16.004
- Mom, it still might turn around.
- Guys, it's a hurricane. Even it turns,

00:16.004 --> 00:18.052
Rebecca's gonna be walking
down the aisle in hip waders.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.082
Not necessarily.

00:19.082 --> 00:21.640
Okay, I'll call the hotel.
Maybe they can move it inside.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.487
- Do you have the number?
- Yes, that has it.

00:22.487 --> 00:25.782
- No, guys. I think we have to postpone.
- No, just wait, wait.

00:25.782 --> 00:28.417
- We can't give up hope yet.
- Mom, we can't ask people to fly to Hawaii

00:28.417 --> 00:32.264
- to get a big fat slap in the face from Zelda.
- How long would you be postponing it?

00:32.264 --> 00:34.285
I don't know. You know, a few
weeks, a month, whatever works.

00:34.285 --> 00:38.153
- That's a shame. I was looking forward to Hawaii.
- Kevin, you'll still get to go to Hawaii, just not tomorrow.

00:38.187 --> 00:40.022
Look, let's all just
have a little faith.

00:40.022 --> 00:43.352
- It might miss the island altogether.
- I'm getting a busy signal at the hotel.

00:43.352 --> 00:45.001
See? The whole world is
canceling. So should we.

00:45.001 --> 00:48.095
Please wait. Let's hear
what Rebecca wants to do.

00:48.095 --> 00:50.419
...airports in and around
the Hawaiian Islands

00:50.452 --> 00:52.953
- have been closed...
- Oh, no. They just closed the airport.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.419
Oh, no. Well, that's that.

00:55.453 --> 00:59.386
- Holly and Rebecca are going to be devastated.
- Mom, can we just stop acting like it's a big tragedy?

00:59.419 --> 01:01.553
All right? It's a reboot. That's all.

01:01.586 --> 01:03.990
- I need another bagel. ...
- Continue to update the situation

01:03.990 --> 01:06.838
as hurricane Zelda develops.
Stay tuned for storm watch.

01:06.838 --> 01:08.082
I think it's a tragedy.

01:10.122 --> 01:12.452
-Should I call Justin? He's
at Nora's on hurricane watch.

01:12.486 --> 01:13.571
Well, I'll call him for you,

01:13.571 --> 01:15.399
but it'll take him 45
minutes to get here.

01:15.399 --> 01:16.982
- It's totally up to you, sweetie.
- Well, I just...

01:16.982 --> 01:21.418
- I... I wasn't aware that we were doing a sonogram today.
- Well, I'd like to confirm how far along you are

01:21.418 --> 01:22.528
before you go off on your honeymoon.

01:22.528 --> 01:25.213
- But if you want to wait...
- No, I'm too excited.

01:25.213 --> 01:25.915
Me, too.

01:31.331 --> 01:32.751
That's the gestational sac,

01:34.312 --> 01:37.017
and there on the left is the head.

01:39.176 --> 01:39.680
Wow.

01:39.780 --> 01:40.944
Oh, wow.

01:41.022 --> 01:42.006
Mom, look at that.

01:42.113 --> 01:45.072
I'm looking. It's amazing.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.163
Let's see if we can get a heartbeat.

01:47.163 --> 01:48.198
Oh, yeah.

01:53.736 --> 01:55.168
Oh!

01:55.202 --> 01:56.669
Oh, my God. Oh.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.061
It's good and strong.

01:58.530 --> 02:01.983
That puts you at about
eight weeks gestation.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.916
Aww.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.712
Justin... you okay?

02:15.383 --> 02:18.050
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:18.083 --> 02:21.883
Talk to me. Come on.

02:28.949 --> 02:33.770
All right. To be honest, I,
um... I'm a little relieved.

02:33.983 --> 02:36.113
You know, with everything
that's been coming at me lately,

02:35.913 --> 02:38.723
I just... oh, God.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.314
I feel like I could use a
little breathing room, you know?

02:40.349 --> 02:41.680
Of course. I understand.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.507
And I want you to know
that I haven't discussed

02:44.497 --> 02:46.482
- your problems at school with anyone.
- Thank you.

02:46.482 --> 02:48.019
And I gather that you haven't either.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.301
No. I haven't told
Rebecca I'm failing yet.

02:53.517 --> 02:56.629
Well...you know, there's...
there's time for that.

02:58.161 --> 02:59.227
Justin, Rebecca's here.

03:00.827 --> 03:03.050
Let's go.

03:03.353 --> 03:05.153
Okay, he's coming.

03:05.618 --> 03:06.163
Hey.

03:06.163 --> 03:06.633
Hey.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.258
You guys didn't tell her?

03:11.258 --> 03:14.799
- Oh, no, no, no. We know. We know.
- Oh, yeah. We heard the news on the car radio.

03:14.799 --> 03:17.285
Oh. Oh, you must be
devastated. We're so sorry.

03:17.285 --> 03:19.634
- I called the hotel. You know, they... oh,
- No, no, guys. That's okay. That's okay.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.297
- I told you she wouldn't mind rescheduling.
- Well, no. I don't want to reschedule.

03:24.577 --> 03:26.221
Rebecca, you don't understand.
The... the airport's closed.

03:26.221 --> 03:26.942
No, I know. I mean, I don't...

03:27.229 --> 03:28.664
I don't want to reschedule in Hawaii.

03:29.807 --> 03:31.941
Mom and I were talking
o... on our way over here,

03:31.941 --> 03:35.023
and well, we wanted a beach wedding,

03:35.023 --> 03:37.140
so I think that we should
get married on the beach,

03:37.140 --> 03:38.635
but in Malibu.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.304
Malibu?

03:40.304 --> 03:43.182
- When?
- Well, this Saturday, like we planned.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.269
I know it's sounds crazy,
but it's what she wants.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.939
Rebecca, you know, I... I think
we should talk about this...

03:47.939 --> 03:49.657
Justin, I heard our baby's
heartbeat this morning.

03:52.345 --> 03:53.528
I want to marry you.

03:53.528 --> 03:56.215
I want to be your wife, and
I have this beautiful dress

03:56.215 --> 03:58.854
that still fits me, barely,
and we have the rings

03:58.854 --> 04:00.554
and all the people the
that we love around us.

04:00.554 --> 04:01.913
I mean, what more do
we need for a wedding?

04:02.839 --> 04:06.451
- Well, actually, there is a lot to organize.
- Well, tell us what we can do.

04:06.451 --> 04:07.854
- Okay...
- I'll call Scotty about the food.

04:09.126 --> 04:10.242
Who's gonna officiate?

04:10.242 --> 04:13.366
- Excuse me! Robert.
- Senators, they're like ship's captains.

04:13.366 --> 04:17.358
Excuse me. Before we continue,
somebody needs to call Tommy.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.425
- I'm onto it.
- Call Tommy. Now where were we?

04:26.526 --> 04:28.287
I think I'm gonna do a little stealing

04:28.287 --> 04:30.793
from Mr. Kahlil Gibran.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.730
Or do you think that
that is way too '70s?

04:33.730 --> 04:36.331
Oh, I just can't believe
that you are officiating

04:36.331 --> 04:37.302
the wedding, Robert.

04:37.302 --> 04:39.260
You should be worrying
about the climate Bill.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.876
Look, I've got the votes,
but if it gets close,

04:41.876 --> 04:45.991
I'll get on the phone and work my magic.

04:48.961 --> 04:49.774
Are you hot?

04:50.488 --> 04:51.081
You feel hot.

04:51.081 --> 04:53.678
Honey, I'm drinking hot tea.

04:53.678 --> 04:56.368
And, you know, you really
don't have to hold my hand

04:56.368 --> 04:59.215
for this... this test tomorrow.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.450
I'm gonna be fine. I mean,
you should go to Washington.

05:01.450 --> 05:03.249
And you can fly back
in time for the wedding.

05:03.249 --> 05:05.063
All right, look, if you want to pretend

05:05.063 --> 05:07.730
that this MRI doesn't
mean anything, that's fine.

05:07.730 --> 05:10.100
But I need to know that this torture

05:10.100 --> 05:11.621
that you've been putting
yourself through is working

05:11.621 --> 05:15.353
and what our options are if
the tumors aren't responding.

05:16.515 --> 05:18.023
I need you to hold my hand.

05:20.368 --> 05:23.280
All right.

05:27.381 --> 05:29.103
My name is Justin, and I'm an addict.

05:29.714 --> 05:30.708
Hi, Justin.

05:31.752 --> 05:34.747
I haven't been going to
too many meetings recently.

05:35.791 --> 05:38.304
Uh, I've been, uh, sober for six days.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.160
I wish I could say two years,

05:41.160 --> 05:44.624
but I had a glass of
champagne at my bachelor party.

05:46.434 --> 05:48.432
I tried to convince myself
it didn't mean anything,

05:48.432 --> 05:49.278
but, um...

05:53.325 --> 05:54.542
Whew. All right. Uh...

05:54.717 --> 05:57.274
The truth is, um, I'm
getting married in two days

05:57.274 --> 05:59.176
and my fiancÃ©e is pregnant.

06:00.917 --> 06:03.180
I feel like I'm losing
control of my life,

06:03.180 --> 06:05.797
and the champagne was
just my pathetic way

06:05.797 --> 06:07.227
of trying to slow everything down.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.844
See, I'm... I'm not
ready to be a father.

06:09.844 --> 06:14.247
And... I'm not even sure
I'm ready to get married.

06:15.059 --> 06:15.633
I love her,

06:16.744 --> 06:18.306
and I want to be with her. I...

06:23.485 --> 06:25.124
I just wish I knew a way out of this.

06:37.088 --> 06:38.385
- David, I'm so sorry.
- What the hell is going on?

06:38.385 --> 06:40.843
- I'm so sorry.
- Do you know how hard it was to hear that?

06:40.843 --> 06:42.002
I... I understand. Just
please listen to me.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.056
No, no. You listen to me.

06:43.105 --> 06:45.298
The only reason I'm not
on the phone right now

06:45.317 --> 06:47.543
is because I respect the
anonymity of these meetings.

06:47.543 --> 06:48.529
That's why I'm here.

06:48.529 --> 06:50.976
- This is my daughter we're talking about.
- I understandand I love her.

06:50.976 --> 06:53.481
But I don't want to hurt
her. So what do I do?

06:53.481 --> 06:56.163
- Do I hurt her now or hurt her later?
- I don't want you to hurt her at all,

06:56.909 --> 06:58.068
but you can't go through with this

06:58.068 --> 06:59.553
if you're not 100% committed.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.227
That's the worst kind of cowardice.

07:01.227 --> 07:04.073
So you either tell her
that she's in this alone

07:04.073 --> 07:06.623
or you figure out some
way to believe in yourself

07:06.623 --> 07:08.928
as a husband and as
a father. You got it?

07:26.989 --> 07:29.590
Oh, Simon. Thank you.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.590
Oh, they're perfect.

07:31.623 --> 07:33.423
My pleasure. Mm.

07:35.423 --> 07:38.290
Wow. I like that.

07:38.323 --> 07:41.123
Most women would've
just put 'em in water.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.123
Well, Paige is our flower girl,

07:43.156 --> 07:45.723
and she needs petals to strewn.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.290
How much do I owe you for these?

07:47.290 --> 07:51.089
Oh, consider it my
contribution to the wedding.

07:51.353 --> 07:53.372
Now that we're having
the ceremony in malibu,

07:53.372 --> 07:55.382
maybe you would like
to come to the wedding.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.154
Would you...

07:58.071 --> 07:58.902
Come to the wedding?

08:00.917 --> 08:01.723
Thank you, Nora.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.702
I would love to, but, uh,

08:03.702 --> 08:05.482
I've gotta go to Portland tomorrow.

08:05.482 --> 08:07.879
I'm trying to raise funds
for my Guatemala project.

08:10.025 --> 08:11.493
Trying to get charitable donations

08:11.526 --> 08:13.933
in this economy is tough,
I am here to tell you.

08:14.144 --> 08:16.573
Well, strictly speaking,
it's not just a charity.

08:16.573 --> 08:17.712
It's also an investment.

08:18.438 --> 08:21.192
You know, I help fund
locally owned business

08:21.226 --> 08:21.817
in poor areas,

08:21.817 --> 08:23.121
local economies grow,

08:23.992 --> 08:26.907
my investors make interest,
you know, just like a bank.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.616
- So you turn a profit?
- Well, for me, it's strictly philanthropic.

08:30.651 --> 08:32.681
Anything I earn, I reinvest
into other communities,

08:32.681 --> 08:34.758
but I'll tell you, it's
a win-win for everybody.

08:34.792 --> 08:38.094
I thought doctors played
golf on their days off,

08:38.094 --> 08:39.518
not saved the world.

08:40.350 --> 08:41.746
It's not like I'm spider-man.

08:41.746 --> 08:42.461
And I'll tell you,

08:42.461 --> 08:44.534
I can't accomplish anything
unless I find this money.

08:44.534 --> 08:47.324
So unless you have
$100,000 lying around,

08:47.324 --> 08:49.115
I'm afraid I am off
to Portland tomorrow.

08:54.498 --> 08:55.257
Well, maybe I do.

08:57.143 --> 08:57.846
Nora, I was kidding.

08:57.846 --> 08:59.565
- I don't want you to get...
- No, really. Really.

08:59.565 --> 09:01.558
- Nora, wait.
- Wait? Wait for what?

09:01.558 --> 09:04.404
I like this. I... I really do like it.

09:06.658 --> 09:08.225
If you're serious, I'll
get you a prospectus.

09:08.225 --> 09:09.650
You can have your
accountant look it over.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.191
Yes.

09:12.092 --> 09:14.091
I'll tell you what, in the meantime,

09:14.091 --> 09:16.475
I'm gonna reschedule some
things up in Portland,

09:17.269 --> 09:19.447
and I will be your date at the wedding.

09:19.832 --> 09:21.594
How does that sound? Deal?

09:22.135 --> 09:22.760
Deal.

09:26.778 --> 09:27.711
Uh, aloha.

09:28.673 --> 09:31.784
Tommy! Oh, you brought Elizabeth.

09:31.784 --> 09:32.782
Look.

09:32.782 --> 09:34.825
It's grandma. Oh, hi.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.302
- Hey, mom.
- Look what a big girl you are.

09:37.302 --> 09:40.602
Oh, I'm sorry. This is
Dr. Simon Craig, my friend.

09:40.602 --> 09:42.302
- My son Tommy.
- How you doing?

09:42.302 --> 09:43.639
- Good. You?
- All right.

09:43.639 --> 09:46.556
- That's, uh, your little girl, huh?
- That's her.

09:46.556 --> 09:48.535
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Thank you.

09:58.028 --> 09:59.006
What's the count?

09:59.006 --> 10:01.893
We lost Fischer and Sugarman's wavering.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.410
- Oh, no. That's bad.
- No, no. I... I got it covered.

10:04.610 --> 10:06.092
No, Robert, I hate to tell you this,

10:06.092 --> 10:07.669
but you cannot do this with your thumbs.

10:07.669 --> 10:09.253
You cannot do this over the phone.

10:09.253 --> 10:10.794
If it's gonna come down to one vote,

10:10.794 --> 10:13.725
- you're gonna have to go to Washington.
- Ok, ok, I don't want to talk about this right now.

10:14.776 --> 10:18.414
Look, you know, I... I appreciate
that you're worried about me, but...

10:18.414 --> 10:21.313
Oh, I'm not worried about
you. You are unflappable.

10:22.213 --> 10:23.510
I, on the other hand, am flapped.

10:26.290 --> 10:27.981
Well, I just wish that
they would hurry up.

10:30.442 --> 10:32.196
You know, I was thinking
about my wedding speech,

10:32.196 --> 10:34.340
and I've, you know,
spoken from the floor,

10:34.340 --> 10:35.547
I've campaigned for president.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.522
I don't think I've ever
given a speech about love.

10:38.522 --> 10:42.831
Right. So, uh, what... what do
you... what do you have so far?

10:42.831 --> 10:45.379
- I was gonna open with a joke.
- A joke?

10:46.162 --> 10:48.439
Like I just flew in from Washington,

10:48.439 --> 10:53.941
- and, boy, are my arms tired?
- Well, I was gonna aim a little higher than that.

10:53.941 --> 10:55.323
But keep 'em coming, shecky.

10:55.323 --> 10:58.063
No, I... I don't think that
you should start with a joke.

10:58.063 --> 10:59.751
- I think that you
are there... - Uh-huh.

10:59.751 --> 11:01.703
To provide, you know,

11:01.703 --> 11:03.610
the official solemnity of the ceremony.

11:03.610 --> 11:05.719
I think it might be better
if you start off with...

11:05.719 --> 11:09.151
with maybe, um, um, a metaphor.

11:09.151 --> 11:12.794
Love is like...

11:12.794 --> 11:16.230
The sun on a cloudy day.

11:16.230 --> 11:17.727
Even though you can't see it,

11:17.727 --> 11:20.754
you still know that it's there?

11:20.754 --> 11:23.358
I think you should start with a joke.

11:26.358 --> 11:28.652
See? It's this.

11:28.652 --> 11:32.245
It's... just sitting here
together in a waiting room,

11:32.245 --> 11:35.905
both of us trying to pretend
that we're not scared...

11:35.905 --> 11:37.022
that's love.

11:37.022 --> 11:39.201
You know...

11:39.201 --> 11:42.060
Not being able to concentrate

11:42.060 --> 11:45.003
writing a speech about
the beauty of love

11:45.003 --> 11:48.105
because you're so scared
that you might lose it,

11:48.105 --> 11:50.477
and nothing would ever be the same.

11:50.477 --> 11:54.303
And realizing that the one place...

11:54.303 --> 11:56.126
the one place...

11:56.126 --> 11:59.471
that you feel most you

11:59.471 --> 12:04.996
is when you are lying next
to her, just breathing.

12:10.998 --> 12:11.953
Mrs. Mccallister.

12:11.953 --> 12:13.927
Oh. Yeah.

12:25.131 --> 12:27.421
- He's still not answering.
- Unreal.

12:27.421 --> 12:28.696
Hey.

12:28.696 --> 12:32.240
- Oh, well, look who's here.
- 30 minutes late. I was about to call border patrol.

12:32.122 --> 12:35.012
- Uh, where's, uh, where's my suit?
- It's in the dressing room.

12:35.012 --> 12:36.603
- Oh, good.
- But the tailor went to lunch.

12:36.603 --> 12:40.751
- Yeah, and he said you didn't come in for your fitting either.
- In case you missed it, I've been a little busy.

12:40.751 --> 12:43.079
Rumor has it you've
been busy making a baby.

12:43.079 --> 12:44.930
- Was that on purpose?
- No, actually, it's not.

12:44.930 --> 12:49.040
- Do they not tell you how babies are made in medical school?
- Can you not pick on me for, like, two seconds?

12:49.040 --> 12:51.693
- Can we not pick on you? Kevin, can we do that?
- Probably not.

12:51.693 --> 12:53.449
Yeah, no. Okay, these
need to be taken in.

12:53.449 --> 12:56.932
- Okay, I can wear a belt. You want to just pin the bottoms?
- Uh, I'm your best man, not your seamstress.

12:56.932 --> 12:58.992
- Okay, I'll do it.
- How?

12:58.992 --> 13:00.920
I'll use... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:00.920 --> 13:02.887
- What? What? What?
- All right. All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.

13:02.887 --> 13:03.560
Okay.

13:11.050 --> 13:11.962
Kev, take your time.

13:11.962 --> 13:13.421
It's not like I forgot to
get the permit at the beach,

13:13.421 --> 13:14.886
and they close at 4:00. Whoa.

13:14.886 --> 13:17.758
Seems like you're forgetting
a lot of things these days.

13:17.758 --> 13:19.785
- Are... are you having second thoughts?
- Is that your idea of giving me a break?

13:19.785 --> 13:23.957
- Tommy, I'm sorry I'm late. I was at a meeting, all right?
- Could you stand still?

13:23.957 --> 13:28.145
Okay. Okay, Mr. Sensitive. Well,
being the better of your best men,

13:28.145 --> 13:30.444
- I'm gonna make sure you're starting to have fun.
- Don't you mean uglier?

13:30.444 --> 13:36.397
Guys, I'm having fun, all right?

13:32.324 --> 13:34.390
- I'm just... I'm a little nervous.
- Okay.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.724
- Okay, you know what? That's great.
- What?

13:38.758 --> 13:40.724
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

13:40.758 --> 13:43.457
- Justin...
- I need you to wait here for these pants to be done

13:43.491 --> 13:45.891
because I parked in a tow-away zone,

13:45.924 --> 13:48.624
- and I forgot I gotta get my hair cut, too.
- Now you know why he needs two best men.

13:48.657 --> 13:51.158
All right, love you.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.657
I can't believe how much
she looks like Julia.

13:58.691 --> 14:00.657
Yeah, she gets her
blonde hair from Julia

14:00.691 --> 14:03.324
and she gets her curls
from... don't say that.

14:03.357 --> 14:05.557
Curly. You had to say it.

14:05.591 --> 14:09.290
I'm really glad you and Julia
worked out your differences.

14:09.324 --> 14:11.390
We still have differences.

14:11.424 --> 14:13.390
Yeah, I know that, but
it wasn't that long ago,

14:13.424 --> 14:15.457
you had no visitation rights at all,

14:15.491 --> 14:18.457
and now you're allowed to
travel with her all by yourself.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.858
That's... that's pretty huge.

14:20.891 --> 14:22.424
Yeah, I guess.

14:24.225 --> 14:26.824
She does know Elizabeth is here, right?

14:26.858 --> 14:28.758
It's my weekend, Kevin.

14:28.791 --> 14:31.058
Did you tell Julia you
were coming to this wedding?

14:31.091 --> 14:33.758
Look, I didn't know I was
coming until this morning.

14:33.791 --> 14:36.591
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- What? It's a 2-hour flight.

14:36.624 --> 14:39.390
- You have to call her right now.
-  Why? I'm supposed to drop her off Monday morning,

14:39.424 --> 14:42.991
- and that's what I'll do.
- It doesn't matter what you do or when you take her back

14:43.024 --> 14:44.424
because your custody agreement

14:44.457 --> 14:46.624
forbids you to take her out of state.

14:46.657 --> 14:50.125
You know what? I can't believe you didn't talk
to me first about th... Tommy, I'm a lawyer.

14:50.158 --> 14:50.777
What would you have said?

14:50.777 --> 14:53.085
I would say you kidnapped her.

15:01.054 --> 15:02.492
- You think she'll find out?
- I don't know.

15:03.039 --> 15:04.196
The lawyer side of my brain is saying,

15:04.196 --> 15:06.595
"do something because
she might press charges."

15:06.595 --> 15:07.913
The brother side of my brain is saying,

15:07.913 --> 15:09.537
"maybe she won't find
out. It'll all blow over.

15:09.537 --> 15:12.841
- And even if she does, she's not the litigious type."
- Who's winning?

15:12.841 --> 15:17.236
- My lawyer side did graduate third in his class.
- I'm leaning with the brother side if that helps.

15:17.236 --> 15:19.569
Really?

15:19.569 --> 15:20.026
Well, then maybe you're right.

15:20.026 --> 15:22.632
Maybe she won't find out,
and it'll all be fine.

15:22.632 --> 15:25.921
I mean, how could... oh, my God.

15:25.921 --> 15:27.300
What?

15:27.300 --> 15:31.319
Oh, my God. I'm so stupid.
Elizabeth's talking.

15:31.319 --> 15:33.353
She's like the most verbal
3 year old on the planet.

15:33.353 --> 15:34.618
She's just gonna go home and tell Julia

15:34.618 --> 15:36.937
what a wonderful time she
had at grandma's house.

15:36.937 --> 15:40.432
- You know, I still think Julia would be fine with it.
- I can't take that chance.

15:40.432 --> 15:43.499
- I'm gonna have to convince her to be fine with it.
- What side of your brain is talking now?

15:43.499 --> 15:48.440
Both. It's unanimous. I don't...
I don't have a choice. All right.

15:50.972 --> 15:51.644
Okay, I just don't understand

15:51.644 --> 15:53.379
how we can have a rehearsal dinner

15:53.379 --> 15:56.024
- without actually having a rehearsal.
- It's called imagination.

15:56.024 --> 15:58.194
We're going to pretend that
the living room is the beach.

15:58.194 --> 16:01.063
- We're gonna do a run-through, and then
we're gonna eat. - Uh, is Tommy here?

16:01.063 --> 16:02.977
Uh, he's upstairs with Elizabeth.

16:02.977 --> 16:07.273
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, fine. I just need to talk to him.

16:07.306 --> 16:09.273
Oh, listen, I just
want to tell you guys,

16:09.306 --> 16:11.273
since we're not going to Hawaii,

16:11.306 --> 16:13.840
- I invited Simon to come to the
wedding. - What? - Are you kidding me?

16:13.873 --> 16:17.173
Don't all jump up and
down at the same time.

16:17.206 --> 16:20.239
No, I just mean, th...

16:20.273 --> 16:22.239
you seem to be getting awfully serious.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.673
Why, because I invited
him to come tomorrow?

16:24.706 --> 16:26.673
Well, if you're gonna stand next to him

16:26.706 --> 16:28.406
at your son's wedding,
I'd call that serious.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.740
And th... this is a
family only affair now.

16:31.773 --> 16:34.173
Don't you think you should
at least speak to Justin?

16:34.206 --> 16:36.173
Yes, yes, I will, but my God.

16:36.206 --> 16:38.139
You were the one that was

16:38.173 --> 16:41.072
pushing me to take a chance
on happinessnd all of that.

16:41.106 --> 16:43.373
I was, wasn't i? Yes.

16:43.406 --> 16:46.773
Okay, Kevin and I are supportive

16:46.807 --> 16:49.239
of Simon coming to the
wedding, aren't we, Kevin?

16:49.273 --> 16:53.106
- Yeah?
- Uh, yeah. I'll even call him "dad" if you want.

16:53.139 --> 16:55.506
Kevin, don't be weird.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.540
You just couldn't resist

16:57.573 --> 17:00.173
- screwing this up for me, could you?
- I didn't screw it up. I fixed it.

17:00.206 --> 17:02.573
- There was nothing to fix, Kevin.
- What is going on here?

17:02.606 --> 17:05.740
- He called Julia. He told her that I kidnapped Elizabeth.
- What? Kevin, why would you do that?

17:05.772 --> 17:06.851
- He took her across state lines without permission.
- No.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.811
Look, everything was fine
until you picked up the phone.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.021
I didn't have a choice. Sooner or later,

17:11.021 --> 17:12.226
Julia would've found out.

17:12.226 --> 17:14.355
Naturally, she was upset, so
I talked it through with her,

17:14.355 --> 17:17.660
- and I didn't use the word "kidnapping."
- Wait, so... so he didn't kidnap her?

17:17.660 --> 17:20.305
- Of course not, mom.
- It doesn't matter. I took care of it, all right?

17:20.305 --> 17:21.262
- You took care of it?
- Yeah.

17:21.262 --> 17:25.669
- Then why did Julia just send me an irate e-mail? - You're
lucky that's all you got. It could've been much worse.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.823
- Kevin, stay out of my business.
- Stop... stop.

17:28.823 --> 17:30.047
- Tommy, that's it.
-Trying to interfere in Elizabeth's life.

17:30.047 --> 17:31.691
Wh... at's enough. Tommy,
you're done. Shut up.

17:31.691 --> 17:33.675
You and I are gonna go for a long drive.

17:33.675 --> 17:37.407
- You're gonna calm down. We will figure this out.
- Oh, I'm calm. There is nothing to figure out.

17:37.407 --> 17:38.990
You will always be a better lawyer

17:38.990 --> 17:42.557
- than you are a brother, Kevin. That will never change.
- Well, then I'm so sorry

17:42.557 --> 17:46.046
- for trying to keep you out of jail a second time.
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

17:46.046 --> 17:53.266
Hey, what's up?

17:53.266 --> 17:55.961
Oh, my shoes shrank.

17:56.788 --> 17:58.755
That happened to my pants once

17:58.788 --> 18:01.955
- after I spent a month in Italy.
-Yeah, but you were fat.

18:01.988 --> 18:04.421
I am apparently retaining fluid.

18:04.454 --> 18:06.004
My piggies are actually piggies.

18:06.004 --> 18:08.195
If you're uncomfortable,
wear house slippers.

18:08.195 --> 18:09.442
It's your family. Nobody cares.

18:09.442 --> 18:12.427
No, because then everybody
will spend the entire night

18:12.427 --> 18:13.987
talking about my health,

18:13.987 --> 18:17.122
and I want Justin and Rebecca

18:17.155 --> 18:19.389
to have a 100% cancer-free wedding.

18:29.088 --> 18:30.655
Hmm. It's the doctor's office.

18:30.656 --> 18:31.656
What if we just don't answer it?

18:31.988 --> 18:34.355
Then we'd never know.

18:34.389 --> 18:35.133
Would that be so terrible?

18:35.133 --> 18:39.454
Kitty, pick up the phone.

18:40.688 --> 18:41.113
Hello.

18:41.638 --> 18:43.638
May I speak to Kitty
McCallister, please?

18:43.671 --> 18:44.828
Uh, yes, this is... this is she.

18:44.828 --> 18:47.213
This Dr. Stephens, Dr. Avadon's partner.

18:47.213 --> 18:50.171
She's in surgery all day, but
she asked me to let you know

18:50.171 --> 18:53.770
that we have your MRI results,

18:52.786 --> 18:54.844
and she wants to discuss them
with you first thing on Monday.

18:54.844 --> 18:58.620
Okay, okay. But... but can't
you just give me the results now?

18:58.620 --> 19:02.700
Unfortunately, the
tumors did not respond

19:02.700 --> 19:04.352
to the chemotherapy the way we hoped.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.674
In fact, there's been
some noticeable growth.

19:06.674 --> 19:08.382
I'm sorry.

19:08.382 --> 19:14.870
Oh, oh. Oh, I see.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.571
Okay, well, I will, uh,
talk to Dr. Avadon on...

19:17.605 --> 19:19.804
- on Monday then.
- Good. It's important.

19:19.837 --> 19:21.471
Thank you.

19:21.504 --> 19:22.937
What'd they say?

19:25.171 --> 19:26.616
Uh, the... the computers are down.

19:26.616 --> 19:30.074
And, uh, they won't be able

19:30.074 --> 19:31.232
to give me my results until Monday.

19:31.232 --> 19:33.680
Well, that's... that's...
that's unacceptable.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.060
They can't leave you
hanging all weekend. I'm g...

19:36.060 --> 19:37.771
- No, no, Robert, it doesn't matter.
- No, I should call.

19:37.771 --> 19:38.872
It was... it was a technician.

19:38.872 --> 19:40.989
Dr. Avadon is not even in the office.

19:40.989 --> 19:43.057
You know, he was perfectly
sweet and apologetic.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.890
And it just... it doesn't matter.

19:44.890 --> 19:47.860
Honey, this way we can just focus on

19:47.860 --> 19:50.390
Rebecca and Justin's wedding.

19:50.390 --> 19:54.346
Well... I mean, if
you're fine waiting...

19:54.346 --> 19:56.059
Yeah, I am,

19:56.059 --> 20:01.671
because I have to go
getmyself some new shoes.

20:01.705 --> 20:04.804
You're amazing.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.271
Did you know that?

20:06.304 --> 20:09.504
Yeah, yeah, I'm... kind of amazing.

20:21.257 --> 20:22.634
Hey, how'd it go out there?

20:22.634 --> 20:25.824
Uh, good. I think I got everything.

20:25.857 --> 20:28.924
- Aren't you supposed to be at your mother's?
- Yeah, I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.891
I mean, but it has been a crazy day.

20:30.924 --> 20:31.983
I feel like we're on a reality show,

20:31.983 --> 20:32.837
and there's some other family

20:32.837 --> 20:36.991
out there racing us to the beach.

20:36.838 --> 20:37.364
Uh-oh, you've got that

20:37.364 --> 20:42.111
are you sure?

20:42.111 --> 20:44.612
Yeah. I said I'm fine.

20:44.612 --> 20:48.660
Well, obviously you're not.

20:48.660 --> 20:51.609
Why am I under a freakin'
microscope every single second?

20:51.609 --> 20:55.732
Justin... I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

20:55.732 --> 21:01.136
What's going on? Justin,
what is going on? Talk to me.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.836
- Okay, I'm on the verge of flunking out of medical school.
- What are you talking about?

21:03.836 --> 21:04.984
That I've worked my ass off,

21:04.984 --> 21:06.585
and I'm back on academic probation.

21:06.585 --> 21:10.004
And I... I don't understand how
I could possibly work any harder.

21:10.004 --> 21:11.574
And to top it off, you're pregnant,

21:11.574 --> 21:13.727
- and we're getting married...
- Wait, I thought those were good things.

21:13.727 --> 21:17.783
- So did I, but I dot know anymore.
- You said that you were excited about the baby.

21:17.783 --> 21:19.153
Okay, what was I supposed to say?

21:19.153 --> 21:21.531
By the time you told me, you
had made the decision for us.

21:21.531 --> 21:24.203
- Are you serious?
- You put me in an impossible situation, Rebecca.

21:24.203 --> 21:27.184
- It's not like I want to disappoint you.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

21:27.184 --> 21:28.728
You asked me how I
felt. That's how I feel.

21:28.728 --> 21:32.207
If I could just get a minute to think...

21:32.207 --> 21:37.639
Oh! The... I... the rings.

21:37.639 --> 21:40.190
- You forgot the rings?
- Yeah, look, I'll get 'em, all right?

21:40.190 --> 21:41.274
The jeweler closes in, like, an hour.

21:41.274 --> 21:48.562
Look, Rebecca, I... I'm sorry, okay?

21:48.873 --> 21:54.483
I'll see you at the house.

22:00.473 --> 22:01.622
You look beautiful.

22:01.622 --> 22:03.439
Well, thank you. You can
stick around if you want.

22:03.439 --> 22:05.417
No, no, no. Rehearsal
dinners are for the family.

22:05.417 --> 22:08.020
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, okay, but sit down, sit down.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.324
I want to discuss something with you.

22:09.324 --> 22:10.688
Uh-oh.

22:10.688 --> 22:15.302
Why do I feel like
I'm about to be fired?

22:15.302 --> 22:17.301
Not even close.

22:19.863 --> 22:22.363
I've been thinking a lot about
your business venture, and...

22:22.363 --> 22:25.174
I want to be part of it.

22:26.912 --> 22:27.626
Nora...

22:27.626 --> 22:29.159
No, let me finish. Let me finish.

22:29.159 --> 22:32.520
Your... your project really
stirs my lefty, liberal...

22:32.520 --> 22:38.130
Female-empowering,
hybrid-driving liberal heart,

22:38.130 --> 22:39.846
and well, the idea

22:39.846 --> 22:41.785
that I could be making
money at the same time...

22:41.785 --> 22:44.870
it's just too good to pass up, so...

22:44.870 --> 22:52.041
Here.

23:06.627 --> 23:09.993
Nora...

23:10.026 --> 23:12.193
I can't take that.

23:12.227 --> 23:14.032
I knew you'd say that.

23:14.032 --> 23:16.111
Nora, don't confuse our relationship

23:16.111 --> 23:18.406
with a... a business proposition.

23:18.406 --> 23:19.890
All right, I won't. I won't.

23:19.890 --> 23:22.076
You're a businessman. I'm an investor.

23:22.076 --> 23:23.471
Send me a monthly statement.

23:23.471 --> 23:28.393
Okay.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.926
But we're gonna have further
discussions about this.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.881
I want you to be absolutely clear

23:32.881 --> 23:34.280
on what you're getting into.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.630
All right. Fine.

23:35.630 --> 23:38.818
Meeting adjourned.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.305
Hey, you know...

23:41.359 --> 23:43.991
You stir my lefty, liberal,
bleeding heart, too,

23:45.753 --> 23:49.086
although in a different
way than I think you meant.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.753
No, I mean it that way, too.

24:04.220 --> 24:06.153
Oh, I spoke to Tommy for over an hour.

24:06.186 --> 24:09.120
I think I finally convinced him that Kevin
talking to Julia was the right thing to do.

24:09.153 --> 24:11.853
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

24:11.886 --> 24:14.186
I'm sure it will be fine.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.299
I have a very good
feeling about tonight.

24:16.299 --> 24:19.339
How many mai tais have you had?

24:19.339 --> 24:20.542
None. Hello!

24:20.542 --> 24:22.288
There they are. Great.

24:22.288 --> 24:25.295
Hi. Oh, this is so sweet.

24:25.295 --> 24:27.372
- Oh! What a great
idea. Scotty did it all,

24:27.372 --> 24:29.830
and he even made a pupu platter.

24:29.830 --> 24:31.875
Oh, we have mai tais and
chi chis in the kitchen.

24:31.875 --> 24:35.678
- God, that sounded so gay, didn't it?
- Thank you so much for everything.

24:35.678 --> 24:37.658
- Ooh, I want to make you something.
- Okay.

24:37.658 --> 24:39.374
- So what can I do to help?
- No, thank you.

24:39.643 --> 24:41.734
Nothing, nothing.
Scotty has done it all.

24:41.734 --> 24:44.203
I think you and I deserve
to relax and have fun.

24:44.203 --> 24:50.786
- Oh, I like your attitude, Nora.
- It's the new me.

24:51.328 --> 24:53.328
Aloha! Hey.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.794
- Welcome to weeki-wacki
Walker world. - Wow, Hawaii...

24:55.827 --> 24:58.127
hi. You look beautiful.

24:58.161 --> 24:59.794
Hey. So how is Tommy?

24:59.827 --> 25:03.493
He's agreed to a truce,
but don't push it.

25:03.527 --> 25:06.228
- Ooh. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

25:06.261 --> 25:09.027
- Yeah, I think it's the pollen.
- Did Justin come with you guys?

25:09.061 --> 25:12.127
Uh, no. We just got here,
but I'm sure he's on the way.

25:14.194 --> 25:16.161
Wow. He didn't seem very happy.

25:16.262 --> 25:18.229
Hey, what's going on? This is Justin.

25:18.262 --> 25:20.663
Keep it brief, and I'll
probably call you back.

25:20.696 --> 25:21.657
Hey, it's me.

25:21.657 --> 25:26.008
Um, listen, I know
that you're overwhelmed

25:26.008 --> 25:27.090
by everything right now,

25:27.090 --> 25:28.795
but we'll get through it.

25:28.795 --> 25:29.972
I mean, we love each other.

25:29.972 --> 25:32.196
Okay, I'll see you soon?

25:32.196 --> 25:33.995
I love you, Justin.

25:53.165 --> 25:54.884
I didn't see... call 911.

25:54.884 --> 25:56.708
- I swear...
- Call 911.

25:56.708 --> 25:59.045
I didn't see him. Hey,
Buddy. Hey, you okay?

25:59.045 --> 26:00.028
You're gonna be okay.

26:00.028 --> 26:02.439
Do me favor. Can you look at me?

26:02.439 --> 26:06.450
Yeah. I'm gonna stay here
with you, but just don't move.

26:06.450 --> 26:09.761
You know what? I'm gonna wrap
this thing around your leg.

26:09.761 --> 26:10.982
You're gonna feel a little pressure.

26:10.982 --> 26:13.105
I know. I know. I know.
I'm sorry it hurts.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.322
I know. I'm sorry it
hurts. What's your name?

26:18.091 --> 26:18.882
Oh, easy on the rum.

26:18.882 --> 26:20.898
Saul has already got an
orchid behind his ear.

26:20.898 --> 26:23.793
Oh, well, that's a very good idea.

26:23.793 --> 26:26.081
- How's this?
- It looks much better on you.

26:26.081 --> 26:27.117
Justin better hurry up.

26:27.117 --> 26:31.382
- There'll be no more coconut shrimp.
- What is he thinking? He's 45 minutes late already.

26:31.382 --> 26:37.665
Julia.

26:37.665 --> 26:38.557
Oh, my God.

26:38.557 --> 26:43.327
Julia. I'm so glad to see you.

26:43.327 --> 26:44.547
I had no idea you were coming.

26:44.547 --> 26:45.697
I didn't either.

26:45.697 --> 26:47.466
Could you please ask
Tommy to come in here?

26:47.466 --> 26:51.551
Well, Kevin said he
talked to you, that he...

26:51.551 --> 26:54.157
- that he worked it all out.
- I know. I thought I could do this.

26:54.157 --> 26:55.789
I thought I could let
it go, but I can't.

26:55.789 --> 26:57.675
Please tell Kevin I'm sorry. No...

26:57.675 --> 26:59.691
Listen, Julia,

26:59.691 --> 27:02.501
the whole family's here
for the rehearsal dinner.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.360
Elizabeth is having
such a wonderful time

27:04.360 --> 27:05.957
playing with her cousins.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.133
I'm sorry, Nora. I need
to speak to Tommy now.

27:08.133 --> 27:14.314
Okay.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.869
And can you bring Elizabeth, too?

27:18.902 --> 27:21.802
Yeah.

27:21.835 --> 27:24.602
Oh, God.

27:24.635 --> 27:27.668
Listen, Julia, I know
that you're furious.

27:27.702 --> 27:30.203
I would be, too, but it's
been so long, and I know he...

27:30.238 --> 27:32.062
Sarah, my baby was
supposed to be playing

27:32.062 --> 27:33.466
in the park across from my house.

27:33.466 --> 27:36.316
What if something happened
to her while she was down here

27:36.316 --> 27:38.837
- and I couldn't get to her in time?
- Hey, um...

27:38.837 --> 27:41.735
Can you guys... can you leave us alone?

27:41.735 --> 27:44.458
No, Tommy. There's nothing
we need to talk about.

27:44.458 --> 27:47.805
I just wanted my daughter to
be at my brother's wedding.

27:47.805 --> 27:50.859
Tommy, please. I'm trying
not to ruin Justin's party.

27:50.859 --> 27:52.335
You're punishing me for
what I did last year.

27:52.335 --> 27:54.241
And I get it. I do.

27:54.241 --> 27:58.654
I just... I want her to
know her whole family.

27:58.654 --> 28:00.026
Please, please don't
take this out on her.

28:00.026 --> 28:02.442
- I need to see her now.
- What are you gonna do at this hour?

28:02.442 --> 28:03.401
Go to a hotel.

28:03.401 --> 28:05.028
We're booked on a flight
first thing in the morning.

28:05.028 --> 28:07.055
Don't do that. You can stay with us.

28:07.055 --> 28:08.733
I'll take you to the
airport in the morning.

28:08.733 --> 28:12.685
Hi, sweetie.

28:12.685 --> 28:15.105
Mommy, look what I got.

28:15.105 --> 28:17.166
I'm gonna give you a big hug.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.982
Okay. So I have her
jacket and her flowers,

28:19.982 --> 28:23.027
and I've got her little pig here.
We're gonna go home now, okay?

28:23.027 --> 28:25.383
Okay. Can you say bye to daddy?

28:25.383 --> 28:28.200
Bye, baby. Bye.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.210
I love you. See you soon, okay?

28:31.210 --> 28:32.564
Goodbye, sugar pie.

28:32.564 --> 28:34.084
I love you to pieces.

28:34.084 --> 28:37.800
Okay. Come on, sweetie.

28:42.983 --> 28:45.031
Please tell Justin and
Rebecca I said congratulations.

28:49.881 --> 28:51.010
Oh, mom.

28:53.385 --> 28:56.985
- Mom, I don't think he's coming.
- Of course he's coming.

28:57.018 --> 28:58.415
You don't understand. We
had an argument earlier.

28:58.415 --> 29:02.025
- I didn't make a big deal about it.
- Yeah, but all couples fight before the wedding.

29:02.025 --> 29:04.900
- It's just jitters.
- No, you should've seen his face.

29:04.900 --> 29:07.949
It was like the walls
were closing in on him.

29:07.949 --> 29:10.924
I mean, he can't face
this or me or any of it.

29:10.924 --> 29:14.847
I just tried calling his cell
phone. He's not answering.

29:14.847 --> 29:18.218
Oh.

29:18.213 --> 29:20.213
Sweetie, listen to me.

29:20.247 --> 29:22.613
Listen.

29:22.646 --> 29:24.280
Justin loves you.

29:24.314 --> 29:26.280
I know he does.

29:28.813 --> 29:29.930
I can't do this anymore.

29:29.930 --> 29:35.502
D... do you think maybe
somebody should go out

29:35.502 --> 29:36.696
and start looking for him or something?

29:38.129 --> 29:41.229
You don't have to. He's not coming.

29:41.263 --> 29:43.596
What? Why not?

29:43.630 --> 29:45.396
Um, I was, uh...

29:45.430 --> 29:48.496
I didn't want to tell you this earlier.

29:48.530 --> 29:51.496
Um, I was sort of hoping
that he would change his mind.

29:51.530 --> 29:54.663
Change his mind about what,
sweetheart? What's happened?

29:54.696 --> 29:56.996
He doesn't want to get married.

29:57.029 --> 30:00.696
I keep trying to make
this work, but it's not.

30:00.730 --> 30:02.696
I love you guys so much,

30:02.730 --> 30:06.996
and I'm really sorry to put
you through this, but, um...

30:09.062 --> 30:12.129
I have to call the wedding off.

30:27.088 --> 30:28.721
He's not picking up.

30:28.754 --> 30:30.043
He's probably not ready
to talk to anybody yet.

30:30.043 --> 30:31.003
I just wish

30:31.003 --> 30:35.754
he would stop listening
to that voice in his head.

30:35.787 --> 30:37.612
Why is he so hard on himself?
He should listen to me.

30:37.612 --> 30:38.964
I think he does listen to you,

30:38.964 --> 30:40.563
more than anybody else in his life,

30:40.563 --> 30:42.708
but there are some
things he's gonna have to

30:42.708 --> 30:44.427
- work out on his own.
- Yeah.

30:44.427 --> 30:50.355
Who do you listen to more
than anybody else in the world?

30:50.388 --> 30:51.455
You.

30:51.487 --> 30:52.787
Okay.

30:52.821 --> 30:53.692
So now that the wedding is canceled,

30:53.692 --> 30:56.134
you really don't have an
excuse not to go to Washington.

30:56.134 --> 30:59.266
- Oh, I walked right into that one.
- Yes, you did.

30:59.266 --> 31:03.921
Yeah.

31:03.954 --> 31:06.121
No, I'm way ahead of you.

31:06.154 --> 31:09.421
I leave first thing in the morning.

31:12.687 --> 31:13.110
I'm still shaking.

31:13.110 --> 31:15.059
I'm sure the whole
family must hate me now.

31:15.059 --> 31:16.334
Nobody hates you.

31:18.592 --> 31:20.161
I want to trust Tommy. I do.

31:20.161 --> 31:23.313
It's just, every time I let
him in even a little bit,

31:23.313 --> 31:24.474
I end up getting hurt.

31:24.474 --> 31:26.599
Julia, you and I have a lot in common.

31:26.599 --> 31:29.975
- There should be a support group for people who marry Walkers.
- Gee, thanks.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.003
I'm just saying,

31:32.003 --> 31:33.795
they... they can seem
like a force of nature.

31:33.795 --> 31:36.028
But, Julia, let's face it. You
are just as strong as Tommy.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.758
And right now y... you're stronger.

31:37.758 --> 31:40.120
I mean, you have a job. You have a life.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.038
The only reason he's in
Seattle is because of you.

31:42.038 --> 31:44.293
So what are you saying?

31:44.293 --> 31:47.641
Maybe it's time you realize
you can live without him.

31:47.641 --> 31:51.866
Maybe it's time you... forgive him.

31:56.658 --> 31:58.263
Justin, maybe we
better do this tomorrow.

31:58.263 --> 32:01.173
- No, I have to see Rebecca.
- I know, but she is really upset.

32:01.173 --> 32:03.354
- I know. I can explain.
- What are... what are you doing? You can't be here now.

32:03.354 --> 32:06.231
- David, don't. That's not gonna help anything.
- Why don't you just leave her alone?

32:06.231 --> 32:08.947
- I'm not gonna leave until I talk to her.
- Just let him talk to her.

32:08.947 --> 32:12.543
- Why?
- Because he is the father of our grandchild.

32:12.543 --> 32:15.248
He is going to be in her life forever.

32:15.248 --> 32:17.799
He is going to be in our life forever.

32:17.799 --> 32:19.714
Where were you?

32:19.714 --> 32:22.838
Hey. Is that blood?

32:22.838 --> 32:25.041
Uh, yeah. It's... it's not mine.

32:25.041 --> 32:27.680
- What happened?
- There was an accident. A kid was hit on a bike,

32:27.680 --> 32:29.925
and I went to the hospital,
but he's... he's gonna be okay.

32:29.925 --> 32:32.395
- So why didn't you call?
- Because in the chaos, I left my phone in the car.

32:32.395 --> 32:34.632
And by the time I got to a phone
Rebecca, you weren't picking up.

32:34.632 --> 32:37.605
Wait. So what... what are you saying,

32:37.605 --> 32:40.250
- at this... this wasn't because you didn't want to get married?
- No.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.358
I mean, yeah.

32:42.358 --> 32:47.941
Rebecca, the truth is, I
had huge doubts tonight.

32:47.941 --> 32:50.213
But not doubts about you,
doubts about myself...

32:50.213 --> 32:53.770
about becoming a husband,
about becoming a father.

32:53.770 --> 32:56.692
But the ridiculous part is,

32:56.692 --> 32:59.307
is I'm completely capable of
taking care of other people.

32:59.307 --> 33:01.791
I had no problems taking
care of that kid tonight.

33:01.791 --> 33:05.061
It seems like the only person
I can't take care of is myself.

33:05.061 --> 33:06.728
Rebecca...

33:06.728 --> 33:09.423
I know I can be a good husband to you

33:09.423 --> 33:12.568
and I know I can be a
good father to our baby.

33:12.568 --> 33:16.525
I can't promise that I won't
doubt myself ever again,

33:16.525 --> 33:18.840
but I will never doubt us.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.415
Give me a second chance

33:22.415 --> 33:25.273
and marry me tomorrow.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.115
Okay.

33:56.350 --> 33:58.009
Hey, ma, I gotta head out.
Uncle Saul is coming to get me.

33:58.009 --> 33:59.664
But I think my button is loose.
Could you fix it real quick?

33:59.664 --> 34:02.143
Oh, yes, yes, yes. I'll
fix it. Don't panic.

34:02.143 --> 34:04.019
All right, here. Yeah, it's right here.

34:04.019 --> 34:07.426
Oh, yeah. It's about to fall off.

34:07.426 --> 34:11.655
- Okay. Don't worry. I'll fix...
- What?

34:11.655 --> 34:13.505
Look at you.

34:13.505 --> 34:16.252
You look so handsome.

34:16.252 --> 34:17.884
Oh, no, no. I was gonna get a haircut.

34:17.916 --> 34:21.049
Oh, every time I've seen
you over the past few months,

34:21.083 --> 34:23.449
you've look so worried and stressed,

34:23.483 --> 34:26.949
and now you look practically serene.

34:26.983 --> 34:29.550
You look pretty serene yourself.

34:29.583 --> 34:31.315
- I do?
- Yeah.

34:31.350 --> 34:33.283
Oh.

34:33.315 --> 34:36.283
Wait. Does this have anything
to do with Dr. Handsome?

34:36.315 --> 34:38.315
Um, well, y... yes.

34:38.350 --> 34:40.650
Mom, you're totally into
this guy, aren't you?

34:40.683 --> 34:43.683
I'm...I'm... yeah, all
right. I'm totally into him.

34:43.717 --> 34:45.884
I'm crazy mad for him. Yes.

34:45.916 --> 34:47.216
Mom.

34:47.250 --> 34:50.116
But this is... this
is... this is your day.

34:50.150 --> 34:50.639
This is completely your day. Wh...

34:50.639 --> 34:51.824
so we're not gonna talk about him.

34:51.824 --> 34:56.275
We're gonna talk about you.
And may I give you some advice?

34:56.275 --> 34:59.177
Mom, it's my wedding day.
I'm pretty sure it's required.

34:59.177 --> 34:59.836
All right, um...

34:59.836 --> 35:05.434
Sometimes the things that
you are most afraid of

35:05.434 --> 35:08.714
are the things that
make you the happiest.

35:08.714 --> 35:11.218
You just figuring that out?

35:11.218 --> 35:14.833
- You knew that?
- I'm here. Hey, Nora. So this is the plan.

35:14.833 --> 35:16.269
I'm gonna make a few brief remarks,

35:16.269 --> 35:17.849
and then I'll recite the vows.

35:17.849 --> 35:21.144
- Since when do you have the power to marry people?
- Since Robert flew to D.C.,

35:21.144 --> 35:22.762
and I got ordained this
morning on my computer.

35:22.762 --> 35:24.685
Just don't tell my rabbi.
All right, Justin. Come on.

35:24.685 --> 35:26.129
Oh, Nora, are you coming with us

35:26.129 --> 35:28.677
- or is what's his name picking you up?
- No, he's meeting me there.

35:28.677 --> 35:31.127
- I have a car full of stuff I have to take.
- Okay. Come on, Justin.

35:31.127 --> 35:36.443
- I love you.
- I love you.

35:36.443 --> 35:37.318
Thank you.

35:37.318 --> 35:40.709
- Oh, I won't let you go.
- Oh, you're gonna have to, ma.

35:40.709 --> 35:42.186
No. You're gonna have
to. I gotta get married.

35:42.186 --> 35:43.851
All right. I'll see you there. I know.

35:48.931 --> 35:51.228
Hi, Simon. Uh, I'm
almost packed up here.

35:51.228 --> 35:52.063
Are you on your way to the beach?

35:58.509 --> 35:59.845
Well, I thought you said

35:59.845 --> 36:01.891
you could move things
around, reorganize?

36:01.891 --> 36:06.349
No, of... of course.
Of course. I understand.

36:06.349 --> 36:08.869
Well, when will you be back?

36:08.869 --> 36:10.949
Ah.

36:10.949 --> 36:14.550
Well, will you call me when you land

36:14.550 --> 36:15.366
so I don't worry?

36:15.366 --> 36:18.321
Okay, great.

36:18.321 --> 36:19.559
Bye.

36:26.145 --> 36:27.671
Aunt Rebecca, you look beautiful.

36:27.671 --> 36:29.987
Aw, I like the sound of
that... "aunt Rebecca."

36:29.987 --> 36:32.632
You look beautiful, too. Thanks.

36:32.632 --> 36:34.593
Hey, mom. Can I wear lip gloss?

36:34.593 --> 36:38.165
Ooh. Maybe Aunt Rebecca has
something in a light pink

36:38.165 --> 36:40.029
- with sparkles.
- Oh, I do.

36:41.571 --> 36:43.638
Hey, honey, it's me.

36:43.671 --> 36:45.638
I just, um, I just wanted to call

36:45.671 --> 36:47.539
and... and say hi.

36:47.571 --> 36:48.200
I'm sure you're on the senate floor

36:48.200 --> 36:49.261
saving the planet,

36:49.261 --> 36:51.991
but I wanted to let you know
that the wedding is still on,

36:51.991 --> 36:55.045
and it seems like all
the... all the storms have...

36:55.045 --> 36:56.661
have blown over.

36:56.661 --> 36:59.328
Oh, my gosh. I have to
go. I'm gonna start crying.

36:59.328 --> 37:02.433
I love you, and, uh, I miss you.

37:02.433 --> 37:03.844
And I will see you soon, okay?

37:03.844 --> 37:05.262
Bye.

37:05.262 --> 37:09.280
Kitty, don't start. If
you start, I'll start.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.438
I know. I'm sorry.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.682
Aunt Kitty, what do you think?

37:13.682 --> 37:17.263
Oh, Paige. Yeah. You look so beautiful.

37:17.263 --> 37:19.801
Sweetie, you have to get dressed.

37:19.801 --> 37:21.942
We gotta meet them at the
beach in less than an hour.

37:21.942 --> 37:24.619
Oh, my God, mom. This is
it. I'm getting married.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.147
Okay, let's do it. Ah. Okay, let's go.

37:31.147 --> 37:31.939
Okay, shoes.

37:31.939 --> 37:34.096
All right, Cooper, I want
you to stay with uncle Tommy

37:34.096 --> 37:38.420
- so he can help you with the ring when the time comes, okay?
- Are they gonna kiss when they get married?

37:38.420 --> 37:42.006
Oh, yeah. Major lip-lock.

37:42.006 --> 37:47.793
Tommy, you fill Kevin
in on all of this, okay?

37:47.793 --> 37:50.411
You know what? Maybe you should do that.

37:50.411 --> 37:52.072
He and I aren't really... there he is.

37:52.072 --> 37:57.136
Elizabeth.

37:57.136 --> 37:59.547
Hi, babe.

37:59.547 --> 38:02.561
Hi.

38:04.439 --> 38:07.188
Come here. Oh, my God. Who's that?

38:07.188 --> 38:08.957
Elizabeth.

38:08.957 --> 38:10.351
Elizabeth. Oh!

39:02.471 --> 39:03.972
Look at you. Yeah.

39:04.005 --> 39:05.972
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

39:06.005 --> 39:06.793
Okay. I've got your boutonniere.

39:06.793 --> 39:10.600
- Is this the official duty of the matron of honor?
- Uh, no.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.100
This is the official
duty of the big sister.

39:49.703 --> 39:50.742
So here we are.

39:50.742 --> 39:53.202
Welcome... finally

39:53.236 --> 39:57.803
to the wedding of Justin and Rebecca.

39:57.836 --> 40:01.016
It's a cliche at this moment
to say "dearly beloved."

40:01.016 --> 40:04.102
I'm sure at most weddings,

40:04.136 --> 40:07.870
those words don't
apply to all the guests.

40:07.903 --> 40:08.642
But in this instance, with this family,

40:08.642 --> 40:13.836
whose love can vanquish any
problem that comes its way,

40:13.870 --> 40:16.003
those words have never been more true.

40:16.037 --> 40:18.269
And so I begin this wedding

40:18.303 --> 40:22.469
with the words "dearly beloved."

40:25.736 --> 40:31.703
Justin has asked Kitty to
recite a poem by E.E. Cummings.

40:33.736 --> 40:36.202
"I carry your heart with me.

40:36.236 --> 40:38.636
I carry it in my heart.

40:38.670 --> 40:41.703
I am never without it.

40:41.736 --> 40:44.836
Anywhere I go, you go, my dear.

40:44.870 --> 40:48.202
And whatever is done by only me

40:48.236 --> 40:51.469
is your doing, my darling.

40:51.503 --> 40:55.136
I fear no fate

40:55.169 --> 40:56.224
for you are my fate, my sweet."

41:06.850 --> 41:07.703
Kitty. Kitty! Kitty!

41:07.703 --> 41:10.029
- Kitty!
- Kitty!

41:12.545 --> 41:14.542
- She's not breathing.
- She's not breathing. My God!

41:14.542 --> 41:17.212
We're at Leo Carrillo Beach.
We need an ambulance now.

41:17.212 --> 41:20.598
Is she breathing? Is she breathing?

41:20.598 --> 41:21.648
Oh, Kitty, come on.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.773
- Nothing.
- Oh, Kitty!
