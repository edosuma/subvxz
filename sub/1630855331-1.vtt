06:15.080 --> 06:16.320
vanilla.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.400
You know?
Like, even the food he cooks is bland.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.600

in my own life story.

Okay, how did you do this?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.920
-How did I do this?
-This is a prank. How did you do this?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.080
-Well, I didn't--
-I don't find it fucking funny.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.200
[laughs] I didn't do anything.

How's the coffee?

-Yeah.
-What?

15:15.400 --> 15:16.240
Oh God.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.040
Oh… oh God.

[panting]

15:22.960 --> 15:23.960
Joan?

15:25.720 --> 15:27.720
[panting] I'm having a panic attack.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.680
-Uh… All right, um….
-I'm having a panic attack.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.520
Okay, okay. Okay. All right, hey, whoa.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.240
Also, Sandy is waiting for that 10:15.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.520
-Is he still there?
-[chuckles] He's still there.

-Just get it over with.
-They made me the gayest man on earth.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.320
Well, I like what he's wearing.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.320
What the fuck is this?

15:47.400 --> 15:49.720
-How the fuck is this?
-Um…

15:50.720 --> 15:51.760
-Give me five.
-Oh.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.400
[chuckles] Yeah. Sure. Thanks.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.800
-Oh my God. Is that what I sound like?
-Sh. Will you be quiet, please?

16:00.840 --> 16:02.320
You think he's better looking than me?

16:02.840 --> 16:06.080
Okay. All right. All right, hey.
Let's slow our breathing down, right?

16:06.160 --> 16:09.280
-Uh, feel the carpet beneath your feet.
-I don't wanna feel the carpet!

16:10.520 --> 16:13.440
-Well, just feel the floor.
-Uh… Fuck the floor!

16:13.520 --> 16:15.520
You're firing me?

16:15.600 --> 16:19.760
[TV Joan] Correct.
Your audio algorithm's not happening.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.960
The board thinks it's vaporware.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.160
But, um,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.480
our carbon footprint.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.040
Not their concern.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.560
Well, I just put a deposit down
on an apartment.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.280
-Also not their concern.
-I mean, you see what she's like.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.360
-Oh my God, she is cold.
-Please.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.360
Not… not now.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.400
If not now, when?

16:42.480 --> 16:45.280
-[laughing] She did not say that.
-[TV Sandy] Oh my God.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.880
I did not say that like that.
That is not what happened.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.280
Baby, I believe you.

16:49.360 --> 16:50.520
[TV Sandy crying]

16:50.600 --> 16:52.160
[Joan] Jesus Christ.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.920
Oh my God.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.240
[TV Sandy] What am I gonna do with my dog?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.320
-Oh my God.
-She's making me so uncomfortable.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.240
I'm so sorry--

17:01.320 --> 17:04.000
-Get Brutus to escort her out.
-Why are you consoling Joan?

17:04.080 --> 17:07.040
-Why am I consoling Joan?
-[TV Sandy] Please just give me a second.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.600
She was upset.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.120
She's being a bitch.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.200
Oh my God.
They're making me look like a monster.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.560
No. Hey, no, look.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.760
Look, it's-- Baby, it's Salma Hayek.

17:18.840 --> 17:22.080
Look, people love Salma Hayek. All right?
So, maybe it's not so--

17:22.160 --> 17:25.000
So, maybe it's not so fucking bad?

17:25.080 --> 17:26.520
So fucking insane?

17:26.600 --> 17:28.440
-This is bad.
-Okay, all right.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.200
-Fucking insane!
-All right, okay.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.160
Hey, look.
I was just trying to make you feel…

17:32.240 --> 17:35.480
-[Joan] Oh God.
-Hey, okay. All right. Hey, you're right.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.400
-Okay.
-Yeah.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.920
-[phone chimes]
-Ooh.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.040
What?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.240
Oh my God, my mom's seen it.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.200
What?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.640
Everybody can see this?

17:45.720 --> 17:48.200
Can everybody
that has Streamberry watch this?

17:48.720 --> 17:49.880
[phone chimes]

17:49.960 --> 17:51.840
-[Joan] My dad's seen it.
-[phone chimes]

17:51.920 --> 17:53.600
Marianne's seen it.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.320
Jesus Christ. Oh fuck.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.520
Oh God.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.160
[Joan breathes heavily]

17:58.240 --> 17:59.720
Oh my God.

18:00.320 --> 18:01.480
Oh God.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.000
-[Krish] Honey.
-What?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.480
-Has Mac been texting you?
-What?

18:07.640 --> 18:08.720
No. No.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.560
-[Krish] All right.
-You can come in now.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.480
-Okay. I think we should turn this off.
-What?

18:17.560 --> 18:20.080
[Krish] Well, actually,
I wanna keep watching. No. No…

18:20.160 --> 18:21.840
-Hey, whoa.
-Krish, Krish, I want it off!

18:21.920 --> 18:23.680
-No.
-[TV therapist] How's life at home?

18:23.760 --> 18:25.200
-Joan!
-[TV Joan] With Krish?

18:25.280 --> 18:32.280
-He's kind and smart and caring, but…
-Where's this stupid fucking button?

18:33.720 --> 18:34.960
Very vanilla.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.320
Even his cooking is bland.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.400
[TV therapist] Hmm.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.280
-I didn't say that. Krish, turn it off.
-[TV Joan] It's just that…

18:41.360 --> 18:43.680
with my ex-boyfriend, Mac,

18:45.040 --> 18:51.240
there was so much
crazy, wild, imaginative,

18:51.320 --> 18:54.200
constant sex.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.560
Hey, hey, hey, hey. This isn't real.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.440
Okay? This is the TV. I didn't say this.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.960
-Fuck.
-Krish?

19:03.560 --> 19:06.120
-[TV Joan] I haven't gotten over Mac.
-Krish!

19:06.200 --> 19:07.400
[TV Joan] I think maybe

19:08.960 --> 19:10.080
I don't want to.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.080
Oh Christ.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.840
Hey. What she said on the show,
that's not what I think.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.160
-Okay?
-No.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.200
Some of the details…

19:26.280 --> 19:28.840
The whole thing,
it's blown out of proportion, okay?

19:28.920 --> 19:30.920
I didn't say that to my therapist.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.880
So, what did you say?

19:35.840 --> 19:36.720
I…

19:39.320 --> 19:40.200
[Krish] Mm-hmm.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.640
-[Krish grunts]
-Krish.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.320
[Krish grunts]

19:43.400 --> 19:45.000
Krish! Where are you going?

19:45.080 --> 19:46.120
I don't know.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.400
-I don't know. I gotta go.
-Krish, come on. Please, please!

19:50.480 --> 19:51.600
[TV Mac] I'm here three days…

19:51.680 --> 19:52.920
-Hey!
-…then back to San Jose.

19:53.000 --> 19:53.840
[Joan] I said…

19:56.080 --> 19:57.560
I can't leave Krish.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.120
Can't you?

20:02.720 --> 20:06.280
[tense music playing]

20:13.720 --> 20:14.680
[Joan gasps]

20:21.480 --> 20:23.200
[TV Joan] So, what do you wanna watch?

20:23.280 --> 20:24.600
Sea of Tranquility.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.320
Eh.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.760
Eric says it blows.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.560
Well, if Eric said…

20:29.640 --> 20:31.600
I never liked Krish.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.680
Babe, wait. Come on, sit down. Babe.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.320
Joan Is Awful?

20:43.680 --> 20:45.640
[TV Joan] Is that Cate Blanchett?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.400
-That's Cate Blanchett?
-Oh no.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.120
-That's Cate Blanchett!
-That's good.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.880
-[TV Joan] That's not my hair.
-She looks good!

20:51.960 --> 20:55.000
Krish! It's a TV show. It's not real.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.840
I don't know what's going on,
but none of that happened.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.840
Krish, hey!
I haven't even seen Mac in so long.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.080
Then show me your phone.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.120
What?

21:09.080 --> 21:13.160
In the TV show, Mac texted you,
and you texted him back, so

21:14.480 --> 21:15.680
show me your phone.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.720
It's…

21:18.760 --> 21:19.880
it's in the house.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.920
That's convenient, Joan.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.320
[phone chimes]

21:26.400 --> 21:27.840
-Goodbye.
-Krish.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.000
Krish, please don't go.

21:30.680 --> 21:34.680
Don't go. Please don't leave me by myself.
This is fucking insane. Please don't--

21:35.640 --> 21:38.000
Krish! Please!

21:39.200 --> 21:40.120
Krish!

21:44.280 --> 21:47.760
[TV Joan] Krish, you're being childish.
Come back, please.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.760
You're being very melodramatic.
It's uncalled for.

21:51.320 --> 21:55.640
Oh my God. It's TV. It's not real!

21:56.240 --> 21:59.680
My fidelity for you.
My fidelity for you, that's real.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.080
That's television. Fake, not real.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.840
If you weren't texting Mac,
show me your phone.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.360
They're right about you, Joan.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.480
You're awful.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.720
Krish. I'm not that awful. It's not real.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.000
[phone ringing]

22:19.080 --> 22:20.160
Come back.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.680
Krish! Don't leave me.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.600
You know I can't be on my own.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.320
-You can't leave me!
-Mac.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.560
[pensive music continues]

23:15.720 --> 23:16.640
Shame on you.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.440
Oh fuck.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.760
Oh God.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.320
-Sorry I'm late.
-[Eric] Uh-huh.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.800
Did you see it?

23:48.440 --> 23:49.520
Everybody saw it.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.160
It's all anyone can talk about.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.000
[exhales] How'd it come across?

23:55.920 --> 23:58.760
Fair. Yeah. I just don't know
what this is.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.560
My lawyer's looking into it.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.200
-Krish is so mad at me.
-Joan.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.960
-He walked out last night.
-Hey, Joan.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.080
Everyone's looking at me
like I'm an actual monster.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.200
Joan, just… just try and keep it together
for, like, the next few minutes.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.600
[sighs] Why is Brutus here?

24:13.160 --> 24:18.240
You let slip about the whole algorithm,
data server, carbon footprint thing

24:18.320 --> 24:19.920
in the scene where you fired Sandy.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.920
Technically, you broke your NDA.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.360
What? That's not fair. That was--

24:26.280 --> 24:27.640
That was Salma Hayek!

24:28.680 --> 24:30.120
The board wants you out.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.360
Now.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.800
I'm here to help you pack.

24:44.760 --> 24:45.600
Right on.

24:46.640 --> 24:47.640
[Joan sniffles]

25:27.400 --> 25:29.200
Sayonara, queen.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.120

25:44.720 --> 25:47.400
"I'm in a pantsuit."

25:54.800 --> 25:56.680
[breathes deeply]

26:15.000 --> 26:17.200
Well, I've checked it over,

26:17.280 --> 26:20.560
and I have to say that actually,

26:20.640 --> 26:24.600
legally, the Streamberry Corporation
can do this.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.440
What?

26:28.840 --> 26:29.960
How?

26:30.040 --> 26:32.040
Trust me, I'm as shocked as you are.

26:33.240 --> 26:36.960
But the show is using my life.
It's… it's my name. It's my career.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.640
It's me. They're… they're using me, so…

26:40.720 --> 26:43.200
And you assigned them
the right to exploit all of that.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.320
What? When?

26:46.520 --> 26:47.520
Terms and conditions.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.720
I have never seen this before.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.800
[lawyer] You have. You just haven't
seen it printed out before.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.560
All of that would have popped up
on your phone or whatever

26:57.640 --> 26:59.280
when you first signed up to Streamberry.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.280
And you clicked "accept."

27:01.880 --> 27:03.920
What? I mean, I had--

27:04.440 --> 27:06.760
I had no--
How was I supposed to know this?

27:06.840 --> 27:11.080
I know. But you did accept it,
and so they're in the clear.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.680
No, no. No, no, no.
They can't… they can't do this to me.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.800
There are only so many ways
for me to tell you they absolutely can.

27:19.880 --> 27:20.800
[exhales sharply]

27:23.440 --> 27:24.800
Okay, well, Salma Hayek.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.360
Yeah, pretty cool.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.120
No. No, I'm gonna sue Salma Hayek.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.040
For what?

27:31.120 --> 27:34.240
[spluttering] For, like,
passing herself off as me.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.560
She has no right to do that.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.920
It's not really Salma Hayek.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.840
Yes, it is.

27:39.920 --> 27:46.600
No. Technically, uh, the show deploys
a digital likeness of Miss Hayek.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.120
They don't film her.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.360
She licensed her image to them.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.120
The entire show is CGI.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.520
It's generated by some kind
of super-advanced, deepfake,

27:56.600 --> 27:58.280
quantum computer mumbo jumbo.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.240
[exhales sharply]

27:59.840 --> 28:03.960
They could make Salma Hayek
blow an orangutan if they wanted to.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.320
[chuckling] Oh, whoa.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.760
I'm guessing Miss Hayek might object
to that, but you get my point.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.640
Right. So it's all… it's all computers?

28:12.720 --> 28:15.120
That's how they get it
on the service so fast.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.520
But how do they…

28:17.600 --> 28:21.800
how do they even know what I'm doing?
It's the same… it's the same day.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.680
Well, you know when you got your phone
face down on the table,

28:24.760 --> 28:27.440
and you're in your kitchen,
and you're talking to your friend about,

28:27.960 --> 28:30.400
I don't know, shoe deodorizers,

28:30.480 --> 28:33.520
and then, you know, you go
on your computer and what pops up?

28:34.120 --> 28:35.520
A shoe deodorizing ad.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.240
Then you get an email,
and it's all about shoe deodorizing.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.360
Then you're walking down the street,
shoe deodorizing.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.000
You can't escape it. And it's…

28:42.080 --> 28:43.640
Yeah, so?

28:43.720 --> 28:46.080
Uh, that's how they know.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.040
Okay, but…

28:48.120 --> 28:48.960
[chuckles]

28:49.040 --> 28:54.200
…but the show
makes stuff up about me. Right?

28:54.280 --> 28:55.800
It embellishes things.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.200
It makes me look worse than I really am.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.640
So… [smacks table] …defamation.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.400
Yeah, page 53, paragraph 12.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.920
There's something about
creating characters and dialogue

29:07.000 --> 29:08.440
for dramatic purposes.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.560
Fuck!

29:14.280 --> 29:15.440
I agree.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.920
Uh, I hate to say it,
but this thing is… is watertight.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.040
Oh my God.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.800
They got you every which way
and then some.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.000
My advice is to try and ignore it.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.800
What the fuck kind of advice is that?

29:29.400 --> 29:30.640
It's the only kind I got.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.240
Oh my God.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.040
[Joan laughing] Okay.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.880
Hi, guys!

29:40.960 --> 29:43.000
Hey, how you doing out there?

29:43.080 --> 29:44.800
Cool! Fuck!

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
[pensive music playing]

29:53.640 --> 29:54.840
Sorry, do I know you?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.920
[groaning angrily]

29:58.400 --> 30:03.840
[TV Joan] This show, it is using my life,
my name, my career.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.720
You assigned them
the right to exploit all of that.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.480
When? How?

30:08.560 --> 30:10.120
Terms and conditions.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.320
I've never even seen this.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.640
-I would've known if I signed it.
-This is brutal.

30:14.720 --> 30:18.640
I would've known I'd signed something
I didn't read. Who has time to read that?

30:19.560 --> 30:20.480
[knocking at door]

30:20.560 --> 30:22.440
[TV lawyer] You did accept it though.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.880
-[TV Joan] What?
-Yeah, they're in the clear.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.640
-[TV Joan] They can't do this to me.
-Oh, hey.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.480
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, yeah.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.280
Hey, uh…

30:37.320 --> 30:38.640
They cannot--

30:38.720 --> 30:40.080
There. Sorry.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.400
[crying]

30:43.680 --> 30:44.800
Oh, baby.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.440
Honey.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.720
[Joan crying]

30:52.280 --> 30:53.320
[Mac] You're okay.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.280
[Joan sobs]

31:00.520 --> 31:01.400
No…

31:02.080 --> 31:03.080
[sobs]

31:19.360 --> 31:21.120
[Joan breathing heavily]

31:23.520 --> 31:24.360
What's wrong?

31:24.960 --> 31:25.880
Um,

31:27.000 --> 31:28.400
I can't get hard.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.560
Sure you can.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.280
Hey, you want me to do
that horrible thing you love?

31:36.200 --> 31:37.080
It's, um…

31:37.600 --> 31:40.000
It's-- This is so public.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.960
What do you mean?

31:42.040 --> 31:44.320
This is gonna be on the show.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.720
Okay, but it's not us.
It's… it's computer people.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.080
-It's Salma Hayek and--
-Well, yeah, I know.

31:51.160 --> 31:54.840
So, I mean, like, I'm gonna be the guy
who can't get it up for Salma Hayek?

31:54.920 --> 31:56.520
I mean, it's like…

31:56.600 --> 32:00.720
You know, it's one thing to not be able
to get it up for, like, you,

32:00.800 --> 32:01.800
but Salma Hayek?

32:01.880 --> 32:03.920
I mean, look,
people are gonna laugh at me.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.440
The show is called fucking Joan Is Awful.
How do you think I feel?

32:08.040 --> 32:10.680
Hey! Look, when I said
I wanted to get back together with you--

32:10.760 --> 32:13.360
When you basically begged me
to get back together with you.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.960
But I didn't agree to be a public figure.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.000
Neither did I!

32:19.280 --> 32:21.160
Except you did.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.600
Page 58 of the terms and conditions.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.840
They just said so on the show!

32:26.920 --> 32:29.920
Joan, I always said
you gotta read the terms and conditions.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.120
I can sue Cate Blanchett.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.240
[scoffs] Uh, for what?

32:50.320 --> 32:52.600
For passing herself off as me.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.520
That isn't the real Cate Blanchett.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.880
The show just deploys
a digital likeness of Miss Blanchett.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.280
The whole show is CGI.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.080
It's generated by a quantum computer.

33:05.160 --> 33:10.000
They could… [chuckles] …make her
blow an orangutan if they wanted.

33:10.080 --> 33:14.440
Although I am guessing the real
Miss Blanchett might object to that,

33:14.520 --> 33:15.760
but you get my point.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.920
[tense music playing]

33:22.840 --> 33:23.680
Hmm.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.360
[tense music continues]

33:52.720 --> 33:53.880
Oh God.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.680
[coughs]

34:06.880 --> 34:08.240
[tense music continues]

34:15.920 --> 34:17.840
[gasps, groans]

34:19.520 --> 34:21.520
[stomach rumbling]

34:23.600 --> 34:24.640
Okay.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.720
[tense music continues]

34:34.240 --> 34:38.080
[priest] Anyone knows a reason
why these two may not be wed,

34:38.600 --> 34:40.040
let him speak now.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.320
[air horn blaring]

34:41.400 --> 34:44.960
-Merry Christmas, one and all!
-[guests murmuring]

34:45.040 --> 34:47.040
[stomach rumbling]

34:47.680 --> 34:48.600
[groans]

34:49.120 --> 34:50.280
[man] Oh my God!

34:50.360 --> 34:52.480
[guests groaning in disgust]

34:53.800 --> 34:54.720
What are you doing?!

34:55.320 --> 34:57.400
[Joan groaning]

34:59.320 --> 35:00.160
Stop!

35:00.920 --> 35:02.280
[screaming]

35:02.360 --> 35:04.800
-Get the kids out of here!
-Get out of here!

35:04.880 --> 35:05.960
[grunts]

35:06.040 --> 35:07.080
[camera shutter clicks]

35:08.680 --> 35:10.040
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[laughs]

35:11.800 --> 35:12.640
What's so funny?

35:12.720 --> 35:13.720
[camera shutter clicks]

35:13.800 --> 35:16.200
Salma Hayek's gonna fucking hate this.

35:17.000 --> 35:17.960
[photographer] Why?

35:19.040 --> 35:20.520
Have you not seen Joan Is Awful?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.000
No, but it's on my list.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.920
Just wait till episode four.
I hear it's gonna be a blast.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.400
Her lawyer's here. Posted bail.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.840
-Uh…
-You're free to go.

35:33.920 --> 35:34.960
Oh.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.000
[female officer] For now.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.920
[laughs]

35:42.200 --> 35:43.400
You're disgusting.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.360
Thank you.

35:44.440 --> 35:47.440
[TV priest] …these two should not be wed,
let him speak now.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.760
[air horn blaring on TV]

35:48.840 --> 35:52.600
[TV Joan] Merry Christmas, one and all!

35:52.680 --> 35:54.640
[guests murmuring]

35:56.360 --> 35:57.520
[guests groaning in disgust]

35:57.600 --> 35:59.160
[TV bridesmaid] What are you doing?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.760
[laughing]

36:06.120 --> 36:08.960
[Joan laughing]

36:10.280 --> 36:12.720
[wedding scene playing on laptop]

36:12.800 --> 36:14.960
[Hayek] Never in my wildest nightmares

36:15.040 --> 36:18.440
I thought I'd see myself
defecating in a church.

36:19.120 --> 36:25.080
Well, technically,
that's the Joan character, not you.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.840
So this character,
whose face do they have?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.680
Do they have your face or my face?

36:31.760 --> 36:33.120
Your face.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.960
Salma Hayek's face.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.600
So, then,
whose anus is doing the shitting?

36:38.680 --> 36:39.640
Uh,

36:40.880 --> 36:43.600
Salma Hayek's anus?

36:43.680 --> 36:44.960
Bingo.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.520
I am Roman Catholic.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.360
My grandmother Rosa was going to be a nun.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.280
She might die when she sees this.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.760
What right do they have to kill my abuela

36:56.360 --> 37:00.760
with this deepfake heretic abomination?

37:00.840 --> 37:03.240
Uh, page 39, paragraph eight.

37:03.320 --> 37:07.440
Paragraph eight can suck my dick.
I don't even know what it says anyway.

37:07.520 --> 37:11.120
Uh, your image rights agreement
with Streamberry.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.640
It's page 39, paragraph eight.

37:13.720 --> 37:18.840
Specifically covers any acts or behaviors
Joan may exhibit

37:18.920 --> 37:22.320
up to, including, and beyond defecation.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.160
Beyond defecation?

37:24.240 --> 37:26.760
Beyond. That's what it says.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.840
You know I don't read this crap.

37:28.920 --> 37:32.720
I am a dyslexic, talented actress
with questionable English.

37:32.800 --> 37:37.120
-That's why I overpay you to protect me.
-Okay.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.400
I mean, doesn't my asshole
have any rights?

37:39.480 --> 37:41.680
-Okay. All right.
-[exhales] Okay, okay.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.240
Okay.

37:43.960 --> 37:44.800
Okay.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.320
Let's collect ourselves, and, uh…

37:48.400 --> 37:49.240
Good.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.840
…brainstorm so we can do
some damage control.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.800
So, what can you do

37:56.520 --> 38:00.240
to erase this image
from every machine in the world?

38:00.320 --> 38:01.240
[clears throat]

38:02.880 --> 38:03.920
Nothing.

38:05.040 --> 38:05.880
Okay.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.760
Then I guess I'm just gonna have to settle
for a huge lawsuit against them.

38:11.360 --> 38:15.040
Um, I've looked up and down
and researched,

38:15.120 --> 38:18.000
and there is no legal basis.

38:18.080 --> 38:21.840
There's no way we can sue these guys.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.680
Then I'm gonna sue you.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.320
You sold me out.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.440
You useless, overrated maggot.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.560
You take your paragraph eight

38:33.200 --> 38:35.440
and shove it up your ass!

38:35.520 --> 38:39.920
And I hope that you get paper cuts
in your hemorrhoids and die!

38:41.720 --> 38:42.960
You're fired!

39:04.920 --> 39:06.320
-[doorbell ringing]
-[snorts]

39:06.400 --> 39:07.360
[confused moan]

39:13.760 --> 39:14.600
What the fuck?

39:23.280 --> 39:24.680
I…

39:24.760 --> 39:28.680
I didn't, uh, actually think
that you would come to--

39:28.760 --> 39:30.240
Welcome to my home.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.680
-I understand that you're mad.
-Oh, do you?

39:33.760 --> 39:35.400
Please don't kill me, Salma Hayek.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.560
You're lucky I'm a humanitarian.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.000
Let's have a talk.

39:40.880 --> 39:41.920
[inaudible] What the fuck?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.080
-Come on!
-Coming!

39:44.160 --> 39:46.800
Oh my goodness me.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.680
Oh my God.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.920
Now it all makes sense.
Look at all this shit!

39:53.520 --> 39:55.280
What's wrong with you, girl?

39:55.880 --> 39:59.640
I mean, must you be so disgusting?

39:59.720 --> 40:03.400
I mean, the last few days
have been pretty rough, so…

40:03.480 --> 40:06.200
Rough enough to take a dump
in the house of God?

40:07.120 --> 40:09.280
If you don't have any self-respect,
that's your thing.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.120
But to disrespect the church,

40:11.200 --> 40:13.640
and frankly, to disrespect my image…

40:13.720 --> 40:16.320
-Mm-hmm.
-…I don't wanna be associated with you.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.600
Well, I don't wanna be
associated with me either.

40:19.680 --> 40:24.480
They took my life.
They turned it into a CGI fucking drama.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.040
I lose my fiancé.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.360
I lose my job.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.560
They put my entire existence out there
for everyone to watch,

40:31.640 --> 40:33.600
and you signed up to be the face of it.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.920
You're a fucking enabler.
I should be yelling at you.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.240
-You are yelling at me.
-Well, I need to yell at someone!

40:40.320 --> 40:43.320
Well, it's not fair
that you're taking it all out on me.

40:44.360 --> 40:48.800
I am sorry that I shat in a church.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.360
Okay?

40:50.440 --> 40:52.680
But I was trying to get your attention

40:52.760 --> 40:54.960
so that you'd get in touch
with Streamberry

40:55.040 --> 40:57.120
and have them pull the plug on the show.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.560
I already made that call.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.360
-And?
-They told me to go fuck myself.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.440
They did?

41:04.520 --> 41:06.000
Can you believe it?

41:07.280 --> 41:08.840
So, you can't stop this?

41:08.920 --> 41:12.520
I thought for once I was gonna have
control over my own image.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.920
But those fuckers lied about everything.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.520
First, they told me
this was gonna be a prestige show, right?

41:19.600 --> 41:22.160
Look, I didn't think it was gonna be
like my movie Frida,

41:22.240 --> 41:25.080
but I couldn't imagine
that it was gonna be this.

41:26.680 --> 41:31.000
And then they said
that they were closing the pay gap.

41:31.520 --> 41:32.400
Bullshit!

41:32.480 --> 41:36.400
They are paying me one-tenth
of what they're paying George Clooney.

41:37.640 --> 41:41.360
Sorry, George Clooney
is gonna be in this show?

41:41.440 --> 41:45.280
No, they're sticking his head
on a Thomas the Tank Engine reboot.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.960
Wait.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.600
How much are they paying you?

41:49.680 --> 41:50.640
Oh,

41:51.600 --> 41:52.440
nothing.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.080
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.280
That is so fucked up.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.200
Yeah.

42:00.280 --> 42:02.720
Well, they're screwing us both.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.680
Yeah.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.720
I mean, how do you think
Cate Blanchett feels about this?

42:06.800 --> 42:07.920
Fuck her.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.480
This is the bad guy.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.640
Mona Giovanni.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.800
-[Joan] Javadi.
-Whatever.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.000
And the whole Strawberry machine.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.320
It's Streamberry.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.320
They have taken 100 years of cinema

42:23.400 --> 42:26.040
and diminished it to an app.

42:26.120 --> 42:30.200
I wanna go and take that computer

42:30.880 --> 42:33.400
and rip the cables out of it

42:33.480 --> 42:35.520
and stick them up its ass.

42:35.600 --> 42:39.280
Let's bring down the system.
The quamputer thing.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.480
Oh yeah, let's.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.960
Are you a hacker?

42:43.040 --> 42:45.280
No, no, no, no, no.
I mean, like, physically.

42:45.360 --> 42:48.760
So it says the server's
outside of Mona Javadi's office.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.720
So we just get in there and fucking…

42:53.960 --> 42:56.280
-You know?
-Her office is all the way at the top.

42:56.360 --> 42:59.200
We can't crawl on the side of the building
like Spider-Mans.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.120
No, no, no, we don't have to.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.520
'Cause you can just
walk in the front door.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.840
We can't just do that.

43:06.920 --> 43:07.800
You can

43:07.880 --> 43:11.440
because you're Salma fucking Hayek.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.240
Thank you.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.480
You're right.

43:20.880 --> 43:21.920
Yeah.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.840
I am Salma fucking Hayek.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.520
[suspenseful music playing]

43:44.280 --> 43:45.360
[Hayek] Good morning.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.000
Hi. Hello. Miss Hayek.

43:49.080 --> 43:51.600
I have an appointment with Mona Javadi.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.400
Of course. Let me just…

43:57.360 --> 43:58.800
[secretary] Uh, I can't, um…

43:58.880 --> 44:02.760
-It should be in the system. Please do…
-Excuse me, is there a restroom I can use?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.800
Of course. Right over there.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.160
I'm afraid that's too public.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.520
Thanks to your show,

44:09.600 --> 44:11.840
every time people see me
go into one of those,

44:11.920 --> 44:15.400
all they can think about
is hot birria coming out of my bottom.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.160
Of course.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.360
Can we swipe Miss Hayek through?

44:20.440 --> 44:23.880
There is a private restroom
down the corridor on the right.

44:24.480 --> 44:25.520
Thank you.

44:25.600 --> 44:27.720
And don't worry, I'm just gonna pee.

44:30.120 --> 44:30.960
Okay.

44:31.680 --> 44:32.880
Cool.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.320
Thank you.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.160
All right, just one sec. Yeah. We're good.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.120
-You rolling?
-Yeah.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.040
Great.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.760
-So, Miss Javadi.
-Mm.

44:49.840 --> 44:53.000
A lot going on here at Streamberry.
Loads of heat around your new show.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.600
-[clears throat]
-I know, right?

44:54.680 --> 44:56.320
-Bet you've got a heap of questions.
-Yeah.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.920
[clears throat, coughs]

44:58.000 --> 45:01.080
-Lucy, I'm in the middle of an interview.
-I think it might be important.

45:01.920 --> 45:02.760
Sorry.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.280
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes?

45:07.360 --> 45:09.800
Apparently, Salma Hayek's downstairs
asking to see you.

45:09.880 --> 45:13.200
-Didn't we tell her to go fuck herself?
-Maybe that's why.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.400
Just get security to chuck her out.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.600
Sorry, sorry. She's new.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.480
-Yeah.
-Don't know how long she'll last.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.240
Anyway, where were we?

45:25.600 --> 45:27.560
-Joan Is Awful.
-Joan Is Awful.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.640
[tense music playing]

45:34.360 --> 45:35.360
[door lock beeps]

45:36.960 --> 45:39.160
-What are you wearing?
-It's a disguise.

45:39.240 --> 45:41.560
Take it off. They're gonna think
you're kidnapping me.

45:41.640 --> 45:42.520
Okay.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.240
-Hurry up!
-Okay!

45:44.320 --> 45:46.320
[tense music continues]

45:48.920 --> 45:49.760
Come on!

45:52.760 --> 45:59.760
So, here at Streamberry, we are passionate
about creating new forms of entertainment.

46:00.440 --> 46:04.440
This whole floor is dedicated
to content generation R&D.

46:05.200 --> 46:08.280
Experimental entertainment,
computer-generated material.

46:08.360 --> 46:09.720
[interviewer] Like Joan Is Awful.

46:09.800 --> 46:10.760
[Mona] Exactly.

46:11.800 --> 46:12.800
Shut up, shut up.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.480
[Mona] And that is made by this,
the quamputer,

46:16.560 --> 46:19.880
which is actually
just down that corridor on the left.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.800
[interviewer] A kind of quantum computer.

46:21.880 --> 46:23.680
Yeah, hence the name.

46:23.760 --> 46:25.240
An infinite content creator

46:25.320 --> 46:30.080
capable of willing entire multiverses
into existence, right?

46:30.160 --> 46:32.320
And within those rendered worlds,

46:32.400 --> 46:35.840
shooting, packaging,
and editing fully-edited programs

46:35.920 --> 46:38.680
that would normally take months
to make, such as…

46:39.440 --> 46:40.520
[interviewer] Joan Is Awful.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.520
I wish they'd stop saying that.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.560
-[Mona] Correct.
-[whispers] I like the picture.

46:44.640 --> 46:48.080
And the role Salma's depicting
is based on a real Joan, right?

46:48.160 --> 46:49.800
Mm-hmm. Yep.

46:49.880 --> 46:52.840
Why that particular woman?
What's so special about her?

46:52.920 --> 46:54.160
Absolutely nothing.

46:54.760 --> 46:58.320
We were looking for a totally average,
nobody person,

46:58.400 --> 47:00.040
just… just to test the system.

47:00.120 --> 47:03.240
The point is,
Joan Is Awful is just the beginning.

47:03.320 --> 47:07.400
The aim here is to launch
unique, tailored content

47:07.480 --> 47:11.080
to each individual in our database,
all 800 million of them,

47:11.160 --> 47:15.920
created on the fly by our system.
The most relatable content imaginable.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.320
Actually, there's one for you.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.240
I couldn't resist. Yeah.

47:20.800 --> 47:23.800
This is actually real and will be
available to stream from Friday.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.520
[uncomfortable chuckle]

47:27.840 --> 47:30.160
Uh, why "awful"?

47:30.840 --> 47:32.520
Why is it all so negative?

47:33.400 --> 47:35.080
Yeah. No, that's a great question, Fatima.

47:35.160 --> 47:39.000
Um, we did try more affirmative content
in the test cell,

47:39.080 --> 47:42.120
but we found
that, um, our subjects just didn't buy it.

47:42.200 --> 47:45.360
It didn't chime
with their neurotic view of themselves.

47:45.440 --> 47:48.520
What we found instead
was when we focused on their more weak

47:48.600 --> 47:51.440
or selfish or craven moments,

47:51.520 --> 47:53.160
it confirmed their innermost fears

47:53.240 --> 47:57.120
and put them in a state
of mesmerized horror.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.680
Which really drives engagement.

47:59.760 --> 48:02.040
They literally can't look away.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.480
Let's kill this quam-puta.

48:04.560 --> 48:07.640
-[Fatima] Wow. Great, thanks.
-[Mona] Did you get everything you need?

48:08.320 --> 48:10.320
Okay. Where is she?
Hi, where is she? Where's Salma?

48:10.400 --> 48:11.760
I let her go to the toilet.

48:11.840 --> 48:14.000
How hard is it to find someone?
Most walls are glass.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.240
Can you guys do something?

48:15.320 --> 48:17.320
[tense music playing]

48:21.760 --> 48:23.480
-[whispers] Is that it?
-It's locked.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.400
There.

48:27.640 --> 48:28.640
[door opens]

48:30.400 --> 48:31.240
[Hayek] There it is.

48:31.320 --> 48:33.920
Holy Christ!
Hey, no one's allowed in here!

48:34.000 --> 48:35.160
I'm calling security!

48:36.440 --> 48:40.080
If you call security,
I will break your arm.

48:40.160 --> 48:43.560
Don't think I won't,
because I will, understood?

48:43.640 --> 48:44.760
Yes, Miss Hayek.

48:45.720 --> 48:47.080
[Hayek] Okay.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.600
How do we get in here?

48:50.320 --> 48:51.480
[Joan] What's that?

48:51.560 --> 48:53.080
Joan Is Awful.

48:53.160 --> 48:54.880
No, but that's me. That should be

48:55.960 --> 48:56.800
her, right?

48:56.880 --> 49:00.520
That's the variant of Joan Is Awful
that the Joan below you sees

49:00.600 --> 49:02.440
when she watches the show.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.800
What? The Joan below me?

49:04.880 --> 49:08.040
You're not the original Joan.
That's Source Joan.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.680
We need a code for this, Joan.

49:09.760 --> 49:10.800
Wait, sh.

49:11.640 --> 49:12.720
"Source Joan"?

49:12.800 --> 49:14.680
Yeah, you're just a Joan.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.000
Who's Source Joan?

49:17.080 --> 49:18.360
The real Joan.

49:18.440 --> 49:20.760
Look, there. Source Joan.

49:21.600 --> 49:22.600
[Joan] Source Joan?

49:24.760 --> 49:26.040
I'm not the real Joan?

49:26.120 --> 49:28.080
You're a version of Joan

49:28.160 --> 49:30.720
played by a digital likeness
of Annie Murphy.

49:31.680 --> 49:33.720
-Who's Annie Murphy?
-The actress.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.080
There. Look familiar?

49:37.160 --> 49:39.480
Schitt's Creek. No? Great show.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.120
-You're playing an adaptation of Joan.
-No, no.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.760
Look. Source Joan lives in reality.

49:44.840 --> 49:48.560
When Source John watches the TV show
Joan Is Awful, she sees you playing her.

49:48.640 --> 49:51.320
That show is the fictive level
we're on right now, here.

49:51.400 --> 49:54.120
-The fictive level?
-Yes, fictive level one.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.880
Like I said,
this is an adaptation of Joan's life.

49:56.960 --> 50:00.240
-You're in a show right now.
-I'm in a show right now?

50:01.040 --> 50:03.120
Come on. Have you seen where you live?

50:03.200 --> 50:06.920
Uh, who could afford a place like that?
It's a TV show house.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.400
I mean, look at me.
Michael Cera licensed his face,

50:09.480 --> 50:12.400
just like Annie Murphy licensed her face
to play Joan on level one,

50:12.480 --> 50:15.360
and Salma Hayek licensed her face
to play Joan on level two

50:15.440 --> 50:17.120
and to play herself here on level one.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.560
[Hayek] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.440
I'm not playing myself.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.720
I am myself.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.400
Yeah, but it tracks that you believe that

50:25.480 --> 50:27.920
because you're coded to play yourself
on this level.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.440
-What?
-What?

50:29.520 --> 50:32.200
We're not in reality right now.
This is fictive level one.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.920
[Hayek] If I'm not here, then where am I?

50:35.000 --> 50:38.280
I don't know where the real Miss Hayek is.
I don't have eyes on her.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.760
She's probably in Zurich
or on a beach somewhere.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.440
-I don't know where she is.
-Zurich?

50:42.520 --> 50:43.360
This is not called

50:43.440 --> 50:46.800
Salma Hayek Gets Everything Explained
To Her But Doesn't Understand It Still.

50:46.880 --> 50:49.120
-It's called Joan Is Awful. Her story.
-What the fuck?

50:49.200 --> 50:50.560
By which I mean the real her.

50:50.640 --> 50:54.520
Not Annie Murphy, Source Joan.
The Joan that lives--

50:54.600 --> 50:56.280
Oh, thank God!

50:56.360 --> 50:58.120
He was so boring.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.800
Jesus!

51:02.240 --> 51:04.840
[exhales] Annie Murphy, you're my hero.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.440
You guard the door.

51:08.920 --> 51:11.320
I'm gonna kill that fucking computer.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.920
[tense music playing]

51:19.120 --> 51:21.480
-She wasn't in the schedule.
-I know that. I was working--

51:21.560 --> 51:22.800
S3? Check S3.

51:26.600 --> 51:29.760
Come on! Come on!
Just kill that quam-puta!

51:29.840 --> 51:31.560
Okay, just wait a second. Wait a second.

51:31.640 --> 51:36.920
So, inside this computer,
there's a version of you playing me

51:37.000 --> 51:38.120
who thinks she's real?

51:38.200 --> 51:39.600
-Yeah.
-[door opens]

51:39.680 --> 51:41.640
-They're coming! Do it! Do it!
-[Mona] Stop!

51:41.720 --> 51:45.680
If you destroy that, you destroy everybody
inside every fictive universe above this.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.880
-You!
-Billions of simulated souls

51:47.960 --> 51:50.160
who consider themselves to be real
will die.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.280
Do you really want all that blood
on your hands?

51:52.360 --> 51:54.640
I mean, define "blood" for me here.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.960
Okay, this is a quantum computer, right?
We barely know how it works.

51:58.040 --> 51:59.360
It's basically magic.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.680
The reality we're in will cease to exist.

52:02.880 --> 52:03.720
Would I die?

52:03.800 --> 52:05.040
Instantly.

52:05.120 --> 52:07.720
Put the fucking axe down,
Annie Murphy, now.

52:08.320 --> 52:10.800
-[Mona] Listen to her. Do as you're told.
-[Hayek] Put it down!

52:10.880 --> 52:11.720
I can't.

52:13.360 --> 52:15.960
Because the fact
that I'm standing here right now

52:16.040 --> 52:18.640
means that Source Joan
already stood here in reality.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.480
-It doesn't matter what I want…
-Get in.

52:20.560 --> 52:23.840
…because the events that this is based on
have already happened.

52:23.920 --> 52:25.440
It's not my decision.

52:26.320 --> 52:28.080
-It's Joan's.
-[Mona] Okay.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.120
-It's happening.
-All right, Joan.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.960
-She's doing it. Joan's doing it.
-[Mona] Joan, put the axe down.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.680
No! The quamputer!

52:35.760 --> 52:39.160
Joan! Fucking Jesus!

52:39.240 --> 52:40.320
[screams]

52:41.000 --> 52:42.560
[tense music playing]

52:47.800 --> 52:49.760
[panting]

52:50.600 --> 52:53.840
[alarm sounding]

52:53.920 --> 52:55.840
I think we're done. [laughing]

53:02.400 --> 53:03.880
[gentle music playing]

53:03.960 --> 53:06.320
-[officer] What's your name, please?
-Annie Murphy.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.440
[officer] Miss Murphy, what do you…

53:26.320 --> 53:27.680
[therapist] So, where are we at?

53:28.920 --> 53:32.040
-Uh, I'm dating again.
-Mm-hmm.

53:32.120 --> 53:34.680
Just taking it slow, you know.

53:34.760 --> 53:37.920
And trying to make some time for myself.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.320
Well, how does that make you feel?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.440
It feels good, you know?

53:42.520 --> 53:44.880
It feels good to be okay on your own.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.120
[therapist] And work?

53:47.920 --> 53:51.960
Yeah. I mean,
my job is far less corporate.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.080
But I'm my own boss.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.520
I… I treat my staff well.

53:56.600 --> 53:58.200
Uh, and I'm actually…

53:59.280 --> 54:01.840
I'm actually proud of what I do. So…

54:02.440 --> 54:04.400
-[therapist] It's good to hear.
-Yeah, thanks.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.120
So, maybe now, do you feel…

54:07.720 --> 54:11.880
Yeah, uh, like the main character
in my own life?

54:11.960 --> 54:12.920
[therapist] Mm-hmm.

54:15.320 --> 54:16.680
Yeah, I… I think I do.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.400
[therapist] And you don't feel
too confined?

54:21.960 --> 54:23.400
-Oh, the house arrest?
-Mm-hmm.

54:24.440 --> 54:27.040
You know, there's good days and bad days.

54:28.440 --> 54:29.960
I guess that's to be expected.

54:33.480 --> 54:35.480
[uplifting music playing]

54:49.040 --> 54:50.360
You're supposed to encourage me.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.680
-What is that?
-Yeah, it's not good. I know.

55:00.440 --> 55:02.160
[Annie] Hi, Joan.

55:02.760 --> 55:04.280
Hi, Annie!

55:04.360 --> 55:05.480
-How you doing?
-[Joan] Good.

55:05.560 --> 55:07.240
-The usual?
-The usual, please.

55:07.320 --> 55:08.240
Okay.

55:09.280 --> 55:11.480
-[Annie] Missed you.
-[Joan] I missed you. How are you?

55:11.560 --> 55:12.400
[Annie] I'm good.

55:12.920 --> 55:14.920
[uplifting music continues]

56:20.200 --> 56:21.400
[air horn blaring]

56:21.480 --> 56:24.840
Merry Christmas, one and all!

56:24.920 --> 56:25.880
[guests murmuring]

56:25.960 --> 56:27.520
[groaning]

56:28.280 --> 56:29.200
[groans]

56:30.080 --> 56:31.520
Yeah, yeah.

56:31.600 --> 56:33.720
[guests groaning in disgust]

56:33.800 --> 56:35.360
Sorry. I know. I know.

56:37.720 --> 56:39.040
Get out! Get out!

56:39.120 --> 56:40.120
[guests screaming]

56:40.200 --> 56:41.960
Yeah. I'm sorry.
