WEBVTT

00:17.400 --> 00:19.080
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:19.160 --> 00:21.680
The dead man belonged
to a Russian resistance organization.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.360
The 15 bodies from the pine forest
were all members of this Red Fortress.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.880
<i>Inspector Rath</i>
<i>has found a freight document</i>

00:27.960 --> 00:31.360
<i>which implicates the group</i>
<i>in a politically charged smuggle case.</i>

00:31.440 --> 00:32.680
How did you know about this freight yard?

00:34.240 --> 00:39.120
For years I have been trying to free
my family's treasure from Stalin's claws.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.120
Your train was my last chance.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.040
<i>-Have you seen the freight?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

00:43.120 --> 00:45.040
Call the Charité hospital
so they come and get her.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.520
-Why?
-They'll take her for free.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.000
-I don't want them to cut her up.
-Well then. Take care of it.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.440
I beg your pardon, Major General.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.720
I couldn't resist.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.760
<i>Your brother Anno</i>
<i>was officially declared dead.</i>

00:58.840 --> 01:00.280
He's finally declared killed in action.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.320
-And now?
-We're here if you want us to be.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.000
<i>I'm in the mood for you</i>

01:14.200 --> 01:17.240
<i>I was in the mood for you yesterday</i>

01:17.320 --> 01:20.280
<i>I will always be in the mood for you</i>

01:20.360 --> 01:23.520
<i>Preferably I'd be alone with you</i>

01:23.600 --> 01:26.000
<i>And when you laugh about it</i>

01:26.400 --> 01:29.320
<i>And whatever you do against it</i>

01:29.400 --> 01:34.240
<i>I'm in the mood inside for you</i>

01:34.800 --> 01:38.440
<i>I don't know what is wrong with you</i>

01:38.520 --> 01:40.000
<i>Is wrong with me</i>

01:40.080 --> 01:41.520
<i>Is wrong with you</i>

01:41.600 --> 01:44.120
<i>I don't know what is wrong with me</i>

01:44.200 --> 01:45.920
<i>And how do you feel?</i>

01:46.000 --> 01:48.240
<i>I, I, I</i>

01:48.320 --> 01:50.720
<i>I'm in the mood for you</i>

01:50.800 --> 01:53.560
<i>I was in the mood for you yesterday</i>

01:54.160 --> 01:58.520
<i>I will always be in the mood for you</i>

02:49.360 --> 02:50.280
Moritz.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.680
-Moritz.
-I know the score.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.280
About what?

03:10.080 --> 03:11.080
About you two.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.080
I know you pretend
there is nothing going on.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.320
I know you have to keep it secret
from Grandpa Engelbert.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.960
Because he would kill you,
or do something bad.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.840
I know you've always
sneaked into mum's bed,

03:23.920 --> 03:25.120
when you think I'm asleep.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.480
I know you're both afraid,
and you're lying.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.520
Moritz!

03:30.800 --> 03:34.640
It's not about that. Actually,
we wanted to tell you something else,

03:34.720 --> 03:36.760
which we have known deep inside
for a long time.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.440
Your father is no longer missing.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.200
He won't be coming back, Moritz.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.120
At some point he will come.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.600
-No, not anymore.
-Yes!

03:49.720 --> 03:50.560
Listen!

03:55.200 --> 03:56.240
He is dead.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.320
You're lying. You both are.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.560
I know he'll come back.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.480
I know he's alive.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.120
And you?

04:11.840 --> 04:13.400
You don't even want us here.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.600
Oh.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.760
CERTIFICATE OF CONDUCT

05:32.920 --> 05:33.840
That's it?

05:34.720 --> 05:36.600
-Just the one page?
-Yes.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.600
And record of the other day
when I went into the flat?

05:41.440 --> 05:42.840
Never happened.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.720
Thank you.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.560
-Lotte?
-Here.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.760
You're wanted.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.960
Yes, I'm... I'm coming.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.120
You're still carrying on?

06:11.320 --> 06:12.320
I need money.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.800
Great that you could accommodate us,
Chief Constable.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.240
If the personal advisor of the President
of the Reich takes the time, then...

07:40.120 --> 07:42.480
the matter must be of importance.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.840
Believe me, I wouldn't have troubled you,
if the matter wasn't extremely urgent.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.480
Gerti!

08:16.560 --> 08:18.760
Gertchen, you have to help me.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.880
What's up? I have a customer.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.400
You have to help me!

08:23.200 --> 08:24.320
<i>No!</i>

08:26.080 --> 08:29.680
<i>This is not the end of the world</i>

08:30.080 --> 08:34.720
<i>Stranded in life and art</i>

08:37.680 --> 08:39.080
I have a message for you.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.240
The President of the Reich

08:40.320 --> 08:43.440
appreciates the way you dealt
with the May 1 demonstrators.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.720
But the matter is not yet ridden out.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.000
-My department could help you.
-We'll see.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.760
-Sir, would you like a drink?
-Thank you, not right now.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.280
I'll do that.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.280
That's my table.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.120
Go smoke a cigarette.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.760
-...with local politics.
-Why?

09:06.360 --> 09:07.360
Just because.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.240
The Soviet government has already
contacted the President of the Reich.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.720
-That's why we are here.
-Who, Stalin?

09:13.800 --> 09:15.880
-In person.
-The matter is simple.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.320
Your confiscation of the train
causes tensions

09:18.400 --> 09:20.480
between the Soviet Union
and the German Reich.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.200
But the President of the Reich
doesn't want any tension. Full stop.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.040
I like to help.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.320
Then release the train.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.080
And what happens with the freight?

09:33.680 --> 09:35.720
It'll go back to where it came from.

09:37.320 --> 09:42.520
That you Soviets are eager to help
build up the illegal <i>Reichswehr</i>

09:42.920 --> 09:44.160
is a matter in itself.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.240
But that even our head of state
doesn't shy away

09:48.320 --> 09:52.080
from ignoring the Treaty of Versailles,
that is...

09:53.000 --> 09:54.480
astonishing.

09:56.320 --> 10:00.080
We just have to return
a misrouted delivery of pesticides.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.320
Please don't make it more complicated
than it is.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.760
Why should such a relevant piece
of evidence leave our country?

10:11.080 --> 10:12.040
Mr. Zörgiebel.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.960
It's in your hands
if the sudden end of your career

10:18.400 --> 10:22.480
will be associated
with the death of many demonstrators...

10:30.880 --> 10:31.800
or not.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.680
Tell me, miss.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.440
Do I know you?

10:51.720 --> 10:52.600
I beg your pardon?

10:52.960 --> 10:54.480
We have met.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.160
-Yes, in here probably.
-No.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.120
Well, then you're mistaking me.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.360
I have a photographic memory.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.120
Maybe you've seen a picture of me.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.320
No? -Hello.
-Morning.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.080
Morning.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.040
Charlotte? Good morning.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.800
I'm sorry.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.600
I need to...
I urgently need to talk to you.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.920
I think you need some coffee first.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.240
-Come on.
-Yes.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.800
So, why can these people
put so much pressure on Zörgiebel?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.600
After all, he's the chief of police.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.200
And you are sure it was the Russian
from the freight yard?

12:39.600 --> 12:40.440
Very sure.

12:46.000 --> 12:46.920
Have you slept at all?

12:48.520 --> 12:50.760
-You look a little tired.
-Don't worry.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.160
Alright then. Let's go back to work.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.280
Are you coming?

13:16.160 --> 13:17.000
Yes.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.840
-You should get some rest.
-Yeah, right.

13:32.080 --> 13:32.960
At home.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.520
I'm fine.

13:35.320 --> 13:38.560
Just for a tiny moment,
I felt a bit... queer.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.440
So, what do you want me to do?

13:42.600 --> 13:43.680
Go home and go to bed.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.680
-But why can't I...
-Enough.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.120
Mr. Wendt.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.400
Colonel!

14:25.840 --> 14:26.960
What do you want from me?

14:28.160 --> 14:31.400
I was privileged to witness almost
all of your successes in the past years.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.840
To me, you're a hero.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.200
-Get to the point.
-A German hero.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.040
You and I,
we both strive for the same goal.

14:39.120 --> 14:43.200
We both want men like you to have
the standing that is their due,

14:43.800 --> 14:46.880
in leading a strong, proud Germany.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.400
Your irresponsible actions have done
considerable damage to our cause.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.120
I myself was duped.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.320
I'm not the man
to restore your reputation.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.400
And I will personally see to it

14:58.480 --> 15:02.720
that this disastrous train is sent back
to Russia as soon as possible.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.120
-And now excuse me.
-But you mustn't.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.800
Everything would be lost.

15:08.120 --> 15:12.680
You might want to strive for a bit
of clarity for a change, Mr. Nyssen.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.880
I know the real reason the Soviets
want that train back so urgently.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.400
And what would that be?

15:29.240 --> 15:30.600
There is gold on that train.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.000
They did spot checks.
They all contained phosgene.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.200
Only one of the wagons has that freight,
and I know its number.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.720
I won't be causing a diplomatic scandal
because of you. I hope you know that.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.760
You won't have to.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.640
The value of the treasure
is at least one billion Reichsmark.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.120
Half of it would be for you,
and the movement.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.920
-And what are they supposed to do?
-Intercept the train in open terrain

16:06.000 --> 16:07.320
and seize the wagon.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.160
We mustn't leave this treasure
to the Bolsheviks.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.480
I'll be in touch.

16:30.680 --> 16:31.760
Look at this.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.040
That bitch.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.480
I asked her for a dress
when we got married.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.120
No, she said, I've taken mine to the Jew.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.640
Hey, you.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
What's the matter?

16:50.200 --> 16:54.320
-What about this, should we keep it?
-No. Chuck it. I'm sick of it.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.800
I don't believe the stuff she kept.
Look at this.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.800
The stuff she had!
This and this...

17:01.880 --> 17:03.800
Here, an embroidered handkerchief.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.400
Throw it in the corner.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.440
What are you doing?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.400
The good into the pot,
the bad into the crop.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.360
Mother is lying there
and you're robbing her stuff?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.800
-Not me.
-If you can afford

17:14.880 --> 17:17.520
to let her valuables go to waste.
I've got mouths to feed.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.440
You?

17:19.560 --> 17:22.440
-What valuables are you talking about?
-This dress.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.000
Top-notch pre-war goods.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.320
The Jew will give me two fivers for that.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.080
But I'm here too, and Toni.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.280
Just because she didn't leave you anything
for shacking up with that bum.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.640
Listen to her.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.760
I'm the eldest.
This is my compulsory portion.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.440
-No!
-Let go.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.520
Right, Daddy, up with your bones.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.720
-Let go!
-Please stop.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.920
-I said let go.
-Ilse!

17:44.000 --> 17:45.840
-What is this?
-This is my dress!

17:45.920 --> 17:49.400
-I said let go!
-What are you doing?

17:49.840 --> 17:53.040
He's sitting on a cushion.
I want to know what's underneath. Help me.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.160
Leave granddad alone.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.600
Stop it!

18:06.080 --> 18:07.560
Granddad!

18:10.840 --> 18:13.200
Are you nuts? Are you out of your mind,
you bastard?

18:14.240 --> 18:17.080
Granddad? Toni, come help me.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.000
No one touches Granddad.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.800
Not you, and you neither.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.800
COLONIAL GOODS
OILS AND FATS, CHOCOLATE, COFFEE AND TEE

18:46.760 --> 18:47.840
-Hello.
-Hello.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.280
-Two black puddings, please.
-Here you are.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.440
One small, one big.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.000
-Thank you.
-Five marks and thirty.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.680
-Fritz!
-Hi, doll.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.320
What are you doing here?
Did you know one of them?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.360
That's not the point. Come along.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.240
I can't. I have to work.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.080
Then tell those murderers at home
what you saw.

19:40.000 --> 19:40.960
The murderers?

19:41.920 --> 19:42.960
What do you mean?

19:43.360 --> 19:46.880
What do you think, who offed those
comrades? The massacre on 1 May?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.600
-Mr. Benda?
-Who else?

19:53.720 --> 19:54.720
Get in line.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.800
Fritz!

20:15.160 --> 20:16.120
Inspector?

20:17.080 --> 20:21.360
Forensics confirmed the calibre
of the dead from the pine forest.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.000
Here, it's the Russian model.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.200
7.62 Tokarev.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.400
Fired from two separate weapons,
both of the same calibre.

20:30.040 --> 20:34.440
But the great thing is, there are
just two registrations of this weapon.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.040
And they were registered last week.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.280
Selenski, Pyotr.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.720
Fallin, Mikhail.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.880
They both belong to the Soviet embassy.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.920
And both weapons were taken at our train.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.120
The gas train?

20:52.600 --> 20:54.880
-We'll arrest them.
-They've tried several times.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.760
But investigations were stopped,
they have diplomatic status.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.080
Why did they try to arrest them?

21:01.160 --> 21:03.000
They like a bit of illegal gambling.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.440
Illegal betting on dogs.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.520
Two marks on the brown one.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.200
The brown one is it. Two marks.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.800
Go on, get him.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.760
Ten marks on that one!

22:12.080 --> 22:13.240
Go on!

22:17.880 --> 22:19.000
Go on, get him!

22:30.080 --> 22:30.920
Those two?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.160
Police! This is a raid.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.400
Game over.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.080
Look! Who are they?

22:44.680 --> 22:45.640
What's going on?

22:46.040 --> 22:49.120
If you take part in illegal dog betting,
you commit a crime.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.040
-Give me your weapon.
-I said, what do you want?

22:52.120 --> 22:57.120
I'm sorry, Inspector, I'm a member
of the consulate of Soviet Russia.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.680
I know. You're arrested
for illegal possession of firearms

22:59.760 --> 23:01.840
-and 15 cases of murder.
-What?

23:04.320 --> 23:06.080
Stop! Stop!

23:06.160 --> 23:09.320
BERLIN POLICE
RECORDS DEPARTMENT

23:51.040 --> 23:53.240
-Charlotte.
-Hello.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.000
-What's the matter?
-I didn't want to disturb you.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.480
You're not disturbing me. Come on in.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.720
Good evening,
I'm a work colleague of your son's.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.560
I can't...

24:06.640 --> 24:09.080
-My parents can't hear you.
-Please.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.400
Good evening, Mr. Jänicke.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.960
Do you want to eat something?

24:26.440 --> 24:27.600
Soup.

24:35.000 --> 24:35.880
We've got them.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.360
-Who?
-The murderers from the printer's.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.080
From the Red Fortress.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.240
That's good then.

24:47.960 --> 24:48.880
Did something happen?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.080
-What's he saying?
-Nothing.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.600
He is asking
if you need a bed for the night.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.720
Well, if that's possible...

25:17.160 --> 25:19.640
Just for a few hours,
I'll be gone again immediately.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.800
No problem. You can have my bed.
I'll take the sofa.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.720
I have to get up early anyway.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.480
It's very tasty.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.280
I'm ok, thanks.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.840
Get yourself a radio by tomorrow.

27:00.600 --> 27:06.040
23 MAY, 2 P.M., 709 KHZ

27:38.000 --> 27:40.320
The number of this wagon...

27:58.720 --> 28:04.560
Strategic point outside the city,
some 50 kilometers...

28:08.840 --> 28:12.200
The route leaves the south of the city...

28:12.280 --> 28:16.600
If we manage at 127 kilometers...

28:17.560 --> 28:19.680
...in direction of Wünsdorf...

28:35.680 --> 28:37.160
Hey, did you steal that?

28:38.240 --> 28:40.640
What? Are you nuts? It's mine.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.760
A thief! This man stole a Panorama!

28:44.840 --> 28:48.440
-Take your hands off me.
-This man stole a Panorama!

28:48.520 --> 28:52.720
A thief! He stole a Panorama! A thief!

28:57.280 --> 28:58.680
<i>-Benda.</i>
-Hi, it's Stefan Jänicke.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.000
-I need to talk to your husband.
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

29:01.080 --> 29:03.160
<i>My husband is rarely home at this hour.</i>

29:03.240 --> 29:07.640
Madam, it is of the utmost importance.
I've already tried the Castle, in vain.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.760
Please tell me
where to find the Councillor.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.520
I'm sorry, the Councillor
didn't inform me of his whereabouts.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.480
<i>-Goodbye.</i>
-Bye.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.560
What are these?

29:39.520 --> 29:43.000
They are pictures of 15 bodies
we found a few days ago.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.000
Taken out of the city

29:45.080 --> 29:46.240
and buried deeply.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.360
But not deep enough.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.680
What do you want from me?

29:51.600 --> 29:53.000
I want to cause trouble for you.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.720
And as much trouble
as 15 murdered activists and two...

29:57.320 --> 30:00.840
confessed agents of your embassy
can cause you.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.880
Fifteen executed revolutionaries
of the Red Fortress.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.200
The railway worker who drove
the train here, also Red Fortress.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.000
I don't know why you're stealing my time.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.280
We confiscated the weapons
of these gentlemen.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.360
There were projectiles from those guns
in almost all of the bodies.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.320
Tokarev 7.62.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.040
Russian replicas.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.920
Exclusively for the members
of your secret service.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.840
What do you want?

30:30.920 --> 30:32.520
I want to propose a deal.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.360
Why should I do deals
with the Berlin police?

30:35.800 --> 30:39.360
Because if you don't, your head office
in Moscow will call you back.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.520
There you and your imprudent staff
will be put up against the wall.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.440
If this massacre becomes public knowledge,

30:48.520 --> 30:52.560
it would most likely mean your
death sentence at home. You know that.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.520
What's your offer?

30:56.080 --> 30:58.080
I want the names
of those responsible of the <i>Reichswehr</i>

30:58.520 --> 31:00.640
who organize the transport
of the poison gas

31:00.720 --> 31:04.640
and have been secretly rebuilding the
German army for years. Names and proof.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.280
You want me to deliver
your own countrymen?

31:10.160 --> 31:13.440
Yes. The top 15 ranks will do.

31:15.920 --> 31:19.440
In exchange, those 15 patriots
who met with an accident in exile

31:19.520 --> 31:21.200
will go home to Mother Russia

31:21.440 --> 31:23.040
"A hand is washed by the other."

31:23.360 --> 31:25.160
You'll have nothing to fear
as far as we're concerned.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.400
We won't investigate those deaths.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.840
Keep the change.
I demand good work, understood?

32:26.920 --> 32:27.760
Thank you. Goodbye.

32:36.840 --> 32:37.760
Thank you.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.480
Do you want to go up and see your folks?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.080
Shall I take you to the Castle?

33:36.680 --> 33:40.600
-Wolter, I've been looking for you.
-Hey, Böhm. All well?

33:40.680 --> 33:43.720
A simple question. What were you
and your friend from Cologne

33:43.800 --> 33:45.080
doing at the Pepita Bar on Thursday?

33:46.840 --> 33:49.480
We yodeled. With all the frills.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.680
Wipe that grin off your face.
Answer my question!

33:53.480 --> 33:54.840
We had a drink.

33:54.920 --> 33:59.120
-With Saint Josef?
-Saint Josef? At Pepita? Nope.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.680
Hey, Jänicke, I deciphered the telegram.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.880
You? On your own?

34:14.960 --> 34:17.880
Czerwinsky has been a master of Russian
since he was born.

34:18.720 --> 34:20.640
I am Balt, so I am masterful.

34:20.720 --> 34:23.840
"Uncle just passed the border,
present on its way to Berlin."

34:23.920 --> 34:25.920
Inspector Rath should get this today.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.120
Deputy inspector Jänicke.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.360
Where is your superior?

34:33.400 --> 34:35.320
-Pardon?
-Your superior, where is he?

34:35.400 --> 34:37.920
-Out.
-How dare he interfere with my case?

34:40.280 --> 34:44.040
Tell him he is in for it tomorrow morning.
Nine o'clock at Gennat's.

34:46.160 --> 34:48.000
Always refreshing, is Böhm.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.520
I think I should let the inspector know.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.320
Take it to his home tonight.

34:58.880 --> 34:59.720
To Wolter's?

35:00.920 --> 35:03.600
The police estate,
opposite the old Lux factory.

35:53.880 --> 35:54.720
Excuse me.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.920
-Can I borrow your radio for a few days?
-Definitely.

35:59.960 --> 36:03.000
What's going on?
Our landlady has been unbearable

36:03.080 --> 36:05.560
-since you told her you're moving out.
-Has she?

36:05.640 --> 36:07.720
I can't even speculate that this has to do

36:07.800 --> 36:10.160
with the sudden appearance
of your sweetheart.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.120
-You're making progress?
-Yes.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.080
This is going to be my own personal ode

36:16.160 --> 36:19.880
to our esteemed Chief of Police
Karl-Friedrich Zörgiebel.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.720
Your new employer.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.840
He didn't like your article.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.440
That's what they say at the Castle.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.800
There.

36:33.760 --> 36:37.400
The right-wing postils have bombarding us
for days with this slush.

36:37.760 --> 36:38.720
The injured police officer...

36:38.800 --> 36:39.880
A HERO RETURNS HOME

36:39.960 --> 36:41.680
...finally goes home to wife and child.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.080
Would work for you, too.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.160
-Have you found the officer?
-Yes.

36:47.840 --> 36:50.480
<i>And the wife, the almost-widow,</i>
<i>and the child.</i>

36:50.560 --> 36:51.960
<i>And I went to the hospital, too.</i>

36:53.000 --> 36:56.520
Hello, Mrs. Dörr.
You don't know me, Katelbach.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.280
I'm an acquaintance of your husband's.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.160
<i>And the evil communist</i>
<i>alleged to have shot him</i>

37:01.240 --> 37:03.160
has just turned three.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.160
You're not serious.

37:09.640 --> 37:10.880
It's all in there.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.640
And tomorrow in the <i>Weltbühne.</i>

37:17.760 --> 37:19.640
Good luck. And see you soon.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.880
How soon? Still uncertain.

37:22.920 --> 37:27.320
That's worse than you think.
You only just started to become bearable.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.200
I'll be in touch. You'll have your
device back in a week at the latest.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.600
Definitely. Elisabeth?

37:51.480 --> 37:52.400
Elisabeth?

38:03.840 --> 38:05.160
One second, Inspector.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.320
Where did you get my address from?

38:09.400 --> 38:11.960
The investigation
against the Chief of Police was dropped.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.160
The families of the dead
want to start civil proceedings.

38:15.240 --> 38:18.800
-Against the despotism of the police.
-You can't just jump on me like this.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.840
You saw the women on Oranienstrasse die.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.960
You saw the men who shot at the women.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.480
I didn't see anything.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.120
The widower told me
you had gone back to the flat. To the balcony. Why?

38:39.200 --> 38:42.080
You just have to testify
that the two women were unarmed.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.880
That there were no fighters or weapons
hidden in their flat. That will do.

38:46.680 --> 38:47.880
It would help a lot.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.160
I won't blow the whistle on my colleagues.

38:53.520 --> 38:57.080
We communists are systematically
branded perpetrators or murderers.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.160
No one seems to care
if that is true or not.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.880
In the case of those two women
it's not true.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.440
I know that, and you know that.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.680
Good evening, Mr. Rath.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.000
I'm sorry.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.080
I was held up.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.480
You look adorable.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.960
Willi? This is Bruno.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.200
You can deliver the shipment.

40:23.040 --> 40:23.920
To my basement.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.760
Yes, alright. You know where the key is.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.320
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

41:18.400 --> 41:20.800
Is there a shortcut
to the police estate somewhere?

41:20.880 --> 41:23.360
Yes, through there, keep to the left,

41:23.440 --> 41:26.120
and cross the premises.
It's on the other side of the factory.

41:26.920 --> 41:27.760
Thank you. A great tip.

42:02.960 --> 42:03.880
Hello?

42:07.360 --> 42:08.240
Hello!

43:26.160 --> 43:27.400
Freeze, police.

43:31.960 --> 43:32.840
Who are you?

43:34.160 --> 43:35.240
What do you want?

44:56.640 --> 44:58.880
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

45:00.240 --> 45:02.200
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

45:03.880 --> 45:05.680
<i>But not yet now</i>

45:08.320 --> 45:11.120
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

45:18.360 --> 45:20.960
<i>Ocean of time</i>

45:22.440 --> 45:24.200
<i>Eternal law</i>

45:25.840 --> 45:28.120
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

45:29.400 --> 45:30.720
<i>To ashes</i>

45:31.480 --> 45:33.200
<i>But not yet now</i>
