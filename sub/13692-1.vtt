KATRINA: What time's the woman
from the bank getting here?

00:28.797 --> 00:31.593
Any time now. I've got
Duncan on guard duty.

00:31.676 --> 00:34.721
Is that wise? First
impressions and all that.

00:45.609 --> 00:47.944
Are you
the lassie from London?

00:48.029 --> 00:50.615
It'll be a relief when
I don't have to
do this any more.

00:50.698 --> 00:55.662
I'm sick of this journey.
Not to mention the poxy
job at the other end of it.

00:55.746 --> 00:58.415
Never mind, soon be running
the old homestead together.

00:58.499 --> 01:00.460
Yeah,
it'll be great, won't it?

01:00.543 --> 01:03.963
All thanks to you.
You've handled
the bank brilliantly.

01:04.047 --> 01:07.343
Not just me. I had your
political nous behind me.

01:12.808 --> 01:15.685
-You're pulling
my leg, aren't you?
-I wouldn't mind.

01:15.769 --> 01:18.106
(DUNCAN CHUCKLING)

01:18.189 --> 01:20.983
Sorry. I was only joking.

01:21.067 --> 01:24.780
-There's no other way round?
-Fifteen miles by the hill.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.157
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:35.792 --> 01:38.379
Oh, look, she's here.
Good morning.

01:40.548 --> 01:42.676
KATRINA:
How long is she staying?

01:42.759 --> 01:46.888
Long enough to wave the
white flag and hand over
the cheque for the bridge.

01:46.972 --> 01:50.810
Can't wait for that either.
I've had just about
enough of this thing.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.187
-Take care.
-Chocks away!

02:00.822 --> 02:03.283
Hello. I'm Katrina Finlay.

02:03.366 --> 02:07.913
Sorry we couldn't meet
properly but, um, I gather
you're only here for the day.

02:07.997 --> 02:12.042
No, I'm going to be
here for quite sometime.
Unfortunately.

02:13.628 --> 02:16.048
If this is how you
greet your customers,
Mr MacDonald,

02:16.131 --> 02:19.635
I can see why your business
badly needs some expertise.

02:19.719 --> 02:21.596
Welcome to Glenbogle.

02:22.638 --> 02:23.765
Mmm.

03:04.521 --> 03:07.608
-Hector, where are you going?
-Isn't it obvious?

03:07.691 --> 03:09.318
I'm just off to
practise my skiing.

03:09.402 --> 03:12.114
Oh, I thought with Archie
running everything now and the

03:12.197 --> 03:14.032
two of us in
our twilight years,

03:14.116 --> 03:16.660
we might spend
a little more time together.

03:16.743 --> 03:19.372
Doing what?
Practising crochet?

03:19.455 --> 03:23.793
Golf. And the only way to
achieve that, I thought, is to
join the wretched club myself.

03:23.877 --> 03:25.796
-Molly.
-So that we
could play together.

03:25.879 --> 03:28.006
Driving,
putting, sharing a bunker.

03:28.090 --> 03:32.220
Molly! I've told you before,
golf is not
a game for the ladies.

03:32.303 --> 03:36.684
It's a cruel, demanding
pursuit. It requires
a lifetime's dedication,

03:36.767 --> 03:38.728
and the patience of a saint.

03:38.811 --> 03:42.274
-Bit like being
married to you then, Hector.
-Quite.

03:50.616 --> 03:53.871
-So, Miss Finlay is...
-My girlfriend.

03:53.954 --> 03:58.041
-I see. Is she
an employee of the estate?
-Not yet.

03:58.125 --> 04:01.212
She's supply
teaching in Inverness.
Just a stop-gap thing.

04:01.296 --> 04:04.299
But once we get the bridge
repaired, we'll be running
the estate together.

04:04.382 --> 04:06.802
Mmm. How lovely for you.

04:12.059 --> 04:13.935
What are these?

04:14.019 --> 04:16.146
It's transport to the house.

04:36.378 --> 04:37.880
Fun, isn't it?

04:40.591 --> 04:43.261
So who was the maniac
who wrecked the bridge?

04:57.694 --> 05:01.324
Sorry, teeing off in
ten minutes. Tally-ho!

05:01.408 --> 05:02.867
Father, wait!

05:05.328 --> 05:07.248
That's my father.

05:07.331 --> 05:10.709
He's a wonderful character.
Oh, how he makes us laugh.

05:11.252 --> 05:12.421
I bet.

05:20.304 --> 05:21.347
Ah.

05:22.932 --> 05:24.476
You're late.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.814
Yes, I was held up
by a troublesome harpy
masquerading as my wife.

05:28.897 --> 05:31.568
But now,
thank heavens, I'm safe.

05:31.651 --> 05:35.613
Ah, gracious greens,
softly undulating fairways,

05:35.697 --> 05:38.909
the reassuring hiss of
a state-of-the-art
sprinkler system.

05:38.993 --> 05:41.955
Ah, yes, indeed. Yes.

05:42.038 --> 05:45.792
At least here, a chap can find
a bit of peace and quiet.

05:45.876 --> 05:47.419
(WOMEN GIGGLING)

05:47.502 --> 05:50.757
HECTOR: What the... Women.

05:50.840 --> 05:54.178
My family have
lived in this spot
since the 14th century.

05:54.261 --> 05:57.222
Of course, there was once a
stone keep here but
the English soon

05:57.306 --> 05:59.224
burnt it down after Culloden.

05:59.308 --> 06:03.730
Mr MacDonald, I have seen
Braveheart. Now let's get down
to business, shall we?

06:03.813 --> 06:04.981
Right.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.651
Ah, Mother.

06:07.735 --> 06:11.197
This is Stella from Lascelles.
My mother, Molly.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.408
-How nice. Stella...
-Moon.

06:13.492 --> 06:16.328
Stella Moon.
What a lovely name.

06:16.411 --> 06:18.289
I'm sorry, my hands are r
ather sticky.

06:18.372 --> 06:21.751
I've just been milking
the sap from this tree.

06:21.834 --> 06:22.919
Oh.

06:23.754 --> 06:25.631
Why, exactly?

06:25.714 --> 06:29.510
Well, I found this
recipe for homemade vodka.
Rots the guts by all accounts,

06:29.593 --> 06:33.431
but if it helps
keep the offy bill
down to four figures...

06:35.976 --> 06:38.687
Perhaps you'd like
to wash your hands.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.084
Just my luck.
The bore has gone.

07:00.296 --> 07:02.424
Has he?

07:02.507 --> 07:04.801
A word of advice, lass.
Everybody lies.

07:04.884 --> 07:07.972
It doesn't really matter
because nobody listens.

07:13.061 --> 07:14.479
LEXIE: Fore!

07:14.563 --> 07:17.315
(LEXIE GIGGLING)
Nice one, girl.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.710
HECTOR: They're so slow.

07:33.793 --> 07:37.006
What are they doing
here anyway? I thought Tuesday
was ladies' day.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.507
No, it's Thursdays too, now.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.343
It's a concession of the new
President, silly chump.

07:41.427 --> 07:46.391
What do you expect when you
elect a bally
greengrocer to the top job?

07:46.475 --> 07:49.896
-What are they doing?
-Perhaps they
can't find the green.

07:49.979 --> 07:52.398
Never have any
difficulty in locating a shop.

07:52.482 --> 07:55.569
Ah, at last.
Can't even play the game.

07:55.652 --> 07:59.031
Thus wildly inconveniencing
those people who can.

08:07.332 --> 08:09.460
What was that?

08:09.543 --> 08:16.426
Your total
indebtedness to Lascelles
now stands at Â£475,000.

08:16.510 --> 08:20.389
After the sadly avoidable
incident at the bridge,

08:20.473 --> 08:25.270
you applied for
a further Â£100,000 loan
in order to repair it.

08:25.354 --> 08:29.108
You calculated that the bank
would eventually realise

08:29.191 --> 08:34.780
that the only way it was
going to get its cash back
was by giving you more.

08:34.864 --> 08:38.994
You were right, we have.
The bridge will be repaired.

08:39.078 --> 08:41.623
Oh, that's great.
So you're here to...

08:41.706 --> 08:43.332
Hand over the cheque, yes.

08:43.416 --> 08:48.589
In fact, I have it here
and I'm authorised
to give it to you.

08:48.673 --> 08:50.424
Fantastic.
Thank you very much.

08:50.508 --> 08:52.592
-On one condition.
-Condition?

08:52.677 --> 08:57.516
The bank is only prepared to
help the estate trade its
way out of its problems,

08:58.350 --> 09:00.562
if you take a back seat.

09:00.645 --> 09:03.773
-What?
-I'm taking over.
With immediate effect.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.449
(WHISTLING)

09:26.758 --> 09:29.094
Ah! Found it.

09:30.513 --> 09:32.682
It went in the stream.

09:32.765 --> 09:37.771
No, no, it didn't, no.
See, it's Matchplay 4.
My ball, see.

09:37.855 --> 09:42.778
Really?
And did an obliging salmon
spit it out on to the fairway?

09:42.861 --> 09:44.863
Are you accusing
me of cheating?

09:44.946 --> 09:48.201
It went in the burn.
I saw it with my own eyes.

09:48.284 --> 09:50.411
And that's a
one stroke penalty. Huh.

09:50.495 --> 09:53.791
And get a move on. You're
holding the ladies back.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.795
Little Hitler. Get back
to your fruit and veg!

09:57.878 --> 10:00.173
What's he know about golf?

10:00.256 --> 10:01.841
(CHOKING)

10:03.051 --> 10:05.971
Look, he's driven
straight into the rough.

10:08.015 --> 10:11.393
-And the water.
-Oh.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.028
Hold on a minute,
you can't do this.

10:19.111 --> 10:22.406
I have sweated blood for this
place, given it
absolutely everything!

10:22.490 --> 10:24.451
Just like the bank,
Mr MacDonald.

10:24.535 --> 10:28.163
We've given you time,
opportunity and not an
inconsiderable sum of money.

10:28.247 --> 10:32.919
And I was making it work.
We had one piece of bad luck.

10:33.002 --> 10:37.883
It's not about luck. It's
about expertise. You evidently
don't have either.

10:37.967 --> 10:41.137
What, and you do? What do
you know about running
a highland estate?

10:41.220 --> 10:43.890
It's a failing business.
The principles are the same,

10:43.974 --> 10:47.728
whether it's a burger shop,
a bra factory or a brothel.
Inputs and outputs.

10:47.812 --> 10:49.897
It's a business,
yes, but it's also a home,

10:49.981 --> 10:52.483
a community,
and I know it
better than anyone else.

10:52.567 --> 10:56.321
I was born here. I grew
up here and it's my life!

10:56.405 --> 11:00.034
Passion. Such a wonderful
thing, in its right place.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.496
-Now do we have a deal?
-No, we do not.
I cannot, I will not accept.

11:03.580 --> 11:08.210
Then let me give you some
advice. This isn't a game
of rugger, Mr MacDonald.

11:08.294 --> 11:11.172
It's a business. Why not
leave it to the experts?

11:11.255 --> 11:15.510
Please have the books ready
for my inspection
first thing tomorrow.

11:20.099 --> 11:22.518
You're back early, Hector.

11:22.602 --> 11:24.897
Feeling below par, are we?

11:24.980 --> 11:27.191
The President is dead.

11:27.274 --> 11:31.237
Oh, dear. Poor man.
Was he assassinated?

11:33.239 --> 11:36.744
-The President
of the Golf Club.
-Oh.

11:36.827 --> 11:41.416
We have to elect
a successor immediately.
The king is dead and all that.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.337
I'm thinking of allowing
my name to go forward.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.715
-You?
-Oh, yes.

11:47.799 --> 11:52.595
When the call of
destiny is heard,
one cannot turn a blind eye.

11:52.678 --> 11:56.266
If you become president of the
Golf Club, you'll never be
away from the place.

11:56.350 --> 11:57.976
I shall never see you at all.

11:58.060 --> 12:03.274
Oh, there'll be
responsibilities, of course.
Perks, too.

12:03.358 --> 12:06.320
That little golf
buggy for a start.

12:06.403 --> 12:10.908
Yes, I... I think I'll
call it the Hectormobile.

Oh, hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

12:22.839 --> 12:25.133
Listen, I've just had
a call from Mary McBride.

12:25.217 --> 12:27.052
Mary who?

12:27.136 --> 12:30.056
You know, the MP. She chaired
the working party on
land reform I was on.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.308
Oh, yeah.

12:32.392 --> 12:35.437
Well, she's in Inverness fo
r the evening and she's asked
me out to dinner. Do you mind?

12:35.521 --> 12:37.148
No, of course not.

12:37.231 --> 12:39.233
How was the lady
with the cheque?
Has she gone yet?

12:39.316 --> 12:43.446
Yep. I mean, not exactly.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.116
I hope you were
gentle on her, Archie.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.077
I tried my very best.

12:48.161 --> 12:49.954
-Bye.
-Bye. Have fun.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.587
So, stopping long, are you?

12:56.670 --> 12:59.047
-Maybe.
-Great.

12:59.131 --> 13:02.260
Have you got a boyfriend?

13:02.343 --> 13:05.848

It is Duncan, isn't it?

13:05.931 --> 13:07.266
At your service.

13:07.349 --> 13:11.354
Any time of
the day...or night.

13:11.438 --> 13:16.776
Oh, well,
actually, there is something
you can do for me, Duncan.

13:16.860 --> 13:20.114
Can you get me
across the Zambezi
some other way?

13:22.700 --> 13:25.370
So, where are you
staying then, Stella?

13:25.454 --> 13:29.124
Some pokey little B&amp;B.

strange on the phone.

Ah, Kilwillie!
What a wonderful surprise.

14:23.564 --> 14:26.149
Come in,
come in, my dear fellow.

14:27.150 --> 14:28.861
Can I tempt you to a tincture?

14:28.944 --> 14:31.739
I thought we might
try some of this.
It's my distillery's new line.

14:31.823 --> 14:35.619
Oh, splendid.
Oh, you're a generous
old mucker, you know that?

14:35.703 --> 14:39.039
Oh, Hector.
I should be thanking you

14:39.123 --> 14:41.543
for all the help and support
you've given me
over the years.

14:41.626 --> 14:45.172
Please, don't speak of it.
What are pals for, eh?

14:45.714 --> 14:46.923
Indeed.

-BOTH: Speaking of which...
-Oh. Sorry.

14:51.929 --> 14:54.391
-No, no, no. You first.
-Please, you're my guest.

14:54.474 --> 14:56.602
Oh, that's very kind.

14:56.685 --> 15:00.648
-It's about the presidency.
-Ah, very glad you
raised the matter.

15:00.732 --> 15:02.817
It's a crucial appointment.

15:02.901 --> 15:07.573
Yes. Especially now that our
sacred greens are being
invaded by alien females.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.826
Yes, Hector!
Yes! Hole in one. That's it.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.079
So...

15:13.163 --> 15:18.252
So...vital that the right
man gets the job this time.

15:18.336 --> 15:22.006
And I think we both
know who that is, don't we?

15:22.089 --> 15:26.094
Well, I think we do.
But thank you, Hector.

15:26.178 --> 15:29.349
Your support for my
candidacy will be invaluable.

15:29.432 --> 15:30.725
Absolu...

15:32.602 --> 15:34.229
Your candidacy?

15:35.648 --> 15:38.234
I'd rather help a rabid
dog to become President.

15:38.317 --> 15:39.902
You haven't a hope
in Hades, you know.

15:39.985 --> 15:42.322
Or a baboon with profound
learning difficulties.

15:42.405 --> 15:46.826
-You can't even
play the bally game.
-Or...a woman!

15:46.910 --> 15:51.290
You'd struggle with the Crazy
Golf on the promenade
at Frinton-on-Sea!

15:51.374 --> 15:55.462
Get off my land before I take
a sand wedge to your
unfortunate anatomy.

15:55.546 --> 16:01.553
You'll regret this, Hector.
Just mark my
perfectly enunciated words.

16:01.636 --> 16:05.307
The last time I saw
a face like yours,
a midwife was slapping it.

16:05.391 --> 16:06.684
-Oh, shut up!
-Yah!

16:06.767 --> 16:08.060
(HECTOR RAZZING)

16:15.527 --> 16:18.406
Arch, you've hardly
touched your dinner.

16:26.957 --> 16:32.046
I'm sorry about
this Stella woman.
It's so unfair on you.

16:32.130 --> 16:36.218
I just wanted to tell her to
go and jump in the loch,
you know, but I couldn't.

16:36.302 --> 16:39.388
You could've,
in a nice Archie-type way.

16:41.725 --> 16:45.020
Anyway,
I think she's bluffing.

16:45.103 --> 16:47.690
-Do you?
-Testing you out.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.902
Seeing how determined
you are to get through it.

16:50.985 --> 16:53.947
If you were to roll over
at the first
sign of pressure...

16:54.031 --> 16:57.201
-So if I tough it out...
-She'll back down.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.204
Isn't that what
Molly and Hector think?

16:59.287 --> 17:01.331
I haven't told them.

17:01.414 --> 17:05.920
I want them to enjoy
their retirement together,
quietly, without upset.

17:06.002 --> 17:08.130
And Katrina?

17:08.214 --> 17:11.635
Haven't told her either.
She's out talking
politics tonight.

17:11.718 --> 17:13.970
Mmm. Nice for her.

17:18.893 --> 17:21.938
Right then, you'll
think over what I said?

17:22.021 --> 17:25.150
Mary, I'm really flattered,
but there's
nothing to think over.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.569
You'd rather be
a laird's wife?

17:27.653 --> 17:31.533
It's not like that.
He's not like that.
We're not married.

17:31.616 --> 17:36.205
Okay. I don't know the man,
he might be St
Francis of Assisi

17:36.288 --> 17:38.582
or he might be Saddam Hussein.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.878
But consider this, what
you seem to be proposing,

17:41.962 --> 17:47.091
smart, funny, talented girl
that you are, is not having
a career of your own.

17:47.176 --> 17:51.347
No, more than that, not
having a life of your own.

17:51.430 --> 17:55.434
I need someone like you
to keep me in touch
with how things really are.

17:55.519 --> 18:00.275
We could be a great team.
And it'd only be the beginning
for you, believe me.

18:00.358 --> 18:03.611
-But there's...
-Think it over.

18:03.695 --> 18:06.365
And remember,
your country needs you.

18:11.997 --> 18:16.001
MOLLY: Meet me at
the sawmill at 10 am

18:16.084 --> 18:20.047
and you will hear
something to your advantage.

18:20.131 --> 18:26.179
I'll be the willowy,
mysterious creature
carrying a rolled-up copy

18:26.263 --> 18:28.515
of the Strathbogle Gazette.

18:39.904 --> 18:41.698
KATRINA:
She has got to be joking.

18:41.781 --> 18:44.826
-I don't think so.
-I'm going over there
right now to set her straight.

18:44.910 --> 18:47.538
Don't bother, sweetheart.
I'll talk to her
in the morning.

18:47.622 --> 18:51.792
Anyway, it's my fight.
I mean,
it's me she wants to demote.

18:51.876 --> 18:54.671
But it's so unfair,
after everything you've done.

18:54.755 --> 18:57.674
-And that's our plans
wrecked just like that.
-No, they're not.

18:57.758 --> 19:00.386
Really? How are we
gonna run the place
if she's in charge?

19:00.470 --> 19:04.224
Because it's never gonna
happen, as Miss Moon
will soon discover.

19:04.307 --> 19:07.102
She's come up here
with nothing more
than a bag of hot air,

19:07.186 --> 19:08.938
and I am gonna puncture it.

19:09.021 --> 19:10.606
-You are?
-Yes.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.569
So come here and
tell me your news.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.071
What news?

19:16.154 --> 19:19.200
You said you had some news.
Mary McBride-type news.

19:19.283 --> 19:23.080
Oh, that. That doesn't matter.
It's not important.

19:50.861 --> 19:52.822
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

19:54.783 --> 19:56.243
Who's there?

19:59.539 --> 20:02.041
-Good morning, Kilwillie.
-Molly?

20:04.168 --> 20:06.422
I expect you're wondering why
I asked you to meet me here.

20:06.505 --> 20:11.011
Well, it had crossed my mind.
Leaving a rather tantalising
vapour trail behind it.

20:11.094 --> 20:13.805
I hope I haven't
dragged you away
from important business.

20:13.889 --> 20:18.227
Oh, my dear girl, of
course not. Even if you had,
tish and pish, who cares?

20:18.311 --> 20:20.855
-It's only this wretched...
-Golf club nonsense?

20:20.938 --> 20:24.776
Indeed. It's a silly,
piffling business

20:24.860 --> 20:27.988
compared to
the global strategy
of Kilwillie Enterprises Inc,

20:28.071 --> 20:32.869
but, you know, somehow
I cannot get my rotund
little head around it.

20:32.952 --> 20:35.956
Your presidential
election strategy?

20:36.040 --> 20:41.379
Exactement. That's the thing.
And a very
ticklish thing it is.

20:41.463 --> 20:46.593
Perhaps you need
a Presidential
Election strategist?

20:46.676 --> 20:50.014
Well, I suppose I do.
But where on earth am I
to find such a person?

20:50.097 --> 20:52.934
I don't imagine
they grow on trees,
especially in Glenbogle.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.478
I don't know, Kilwillie.

20:54.561 --> 20:58.815
Sometimes you find things
where you least expect them.

20:58.899 --> 21:03.738
But you don't mean...
No, you wouldn't.

21:03.821 --> 21:06.492
You'd never work
against Hector's interests,
would you?

21:06.575 --> 21:09.703
Oh, my dear man,
whatever gave you that idea?

21:11.915 --> 21:17.296
It's just that
living here, Golly,
one remains an innocent.

21:17.380 --> 21:22.385
Unversed in the...
In politics and the sordid
realities of the world.

21:22.468 --> 21:24.388
Whereas?

21:24.471 --> 21:28.809
Whereas you, Golly, are
a veritable thug in tweeds.

21:28.892 --> 21:31.062
Thank you very much, Hector.
I love you, too.

21:31.145 --> 21:37.987
No, what I mean is, you have
a chilling flair for when and
where to stick the dirk in.

21:38.070 --> 21:41.575
-And this time,
Kilwillie's the hit, right?
-Indeed.

21:41.658 --> 21:46.454
Send him to sleep with the
fishes, Golly. Electorally
speaking of course.

21:46.538 --> 21:49.083
-Okay, boss.
-Excellent.

21:49.166 --> 21:54.131
-Erm, what do...
What do I get out of it?
-What, what...

22:04.267 --> 22:05.894
Thank you, boss.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.752
The answer is no.

22:27.794 --> 22:29.756
I see.

22:29.839 --> 22:32.425
I simply can't see what
advantage would be gained
for this estate,

22:32.508 --> 22:35.346
or indeed the bank,
by you taking over from me.

22:35.429 --> 22:37.181
Uh-huh.

22:37.264 --> 22:39.850
I'm sorry, but I think I have
the greater
knowledge and experience.

22:39.934 --> 22:44.689
I believe I am the only person
who can put this
place back on its feet.

22:44.773 --> 22:49.654
-Right.
-With all due respect
and no offence intended.

22:49.737 --> 22:54.243
Fine. Then I can do no
more here. For the present.

23:14.975 --> 23:18.145
-How did it go?
-Fine.

23:18.229 --> 23:20.773
-Did you tell her?
-I most certainly did.

23:20.856 --> 23:24.820
See, I knew it would work.
Good on you, Arch.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.448
Lex,
sometimes a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

23:30.243 --> 23:34.747
Now then, Duncan,
have you got any
lengths of two by two?

23:37.167 --> 23:40.839
Don't despair, Kilwillie,
I think I can see a way.

23:40.922 --> 23:42.841
Oh, Molly, can you?

23:42.924 --> 23:45.552
The smaller the electorate,
the more susceptible
they are to pressure.

23:45.635 --> 23:47.388
I'm not sure I...

23:47.471 --> 23:51.017
The Reverend Snoddy,
exceedingly fond of the sauce.

23:51.100 --> 23:54.271
Send him a crate of wine.

23:54.354 --> 23:56.982
You know MacSween who
runs the hardware store?

23:57.065 --> 24:01.237
His wife's
the most terrible snob.
Invite them to dinner.

24:01.321 --> 24:03.364
Oh, I see.

24:03.448 --> 24:08.329
And the Rear Admiral, you
remember, he once accused
Hector of cheating at canasta.

24:08.412 --> 24:11.124
-This is going to
be fun, isn't it?
-Oh, Molly.

24:11.207 --> 24:15.879
Can an admiring and
deeply grateful fellow
give you a kiss?

24:18.382 --> 24:21.260
Let's go oil
the wheels of democracy first,
shall we?

24:21.344 --> 24:28.185
And then, said deeply grateful
fellow, can offer a girl
a morsel of recompense.

24:28.268 --> 24:30.563
You see, Kilwillie's
virtually a new boy.

24:30.647 --> 24:35.527
I've known these
lads for years.
McLeod, Arnatt, old Shuggs.

24:35.611 --> 24:39.406
All of them.
No, no, I'm quietly
confident of my reputation.

24:39.490 --> 24:43.411
However confident you are,
Hector, I think we'd better
check these laddies out.

24:43.495 --> 24:45.997
-Just to be on the safe side.
-Oh, very well.

24:46.081 --> 24:49.543
-Meanwhile, I shall
press the flesh in person.
-Where are you going?

24:49.627 --> 24:52.421
19th hole, ultimately.
Tally-ho.

24:58.763 --> 25:00.765
This is from my holiday fund,
you know.

25:00.848 --> 25:02.892
I'll pay you back.
I just need some petrol money.

25:02.976 --> 25:06.897
Right. Well,
that's 5.25, two Irish punts,

25:06.981 --> 25:10.150
and 250 drachmas.

25:13.363 --> 25:16.951
Arch, you did get
the cheque off of Stella,
didn't you?

25:18.077 --> 25:19.453
The cheque.

25:44.274 --> 25:46.986
Okay, what are you doing?

25:47.069 --> 25:51.991
You rejected Plan A.
This is Plan B.
There is no Plan C.

25:52.074 --> 25:56.330
But you can't just...
Duncan, will you stop that?

25:56.413 --> 25:58.833
You'll never sell the place
with the bridge in that state.

25:58.916 --> 26:01.294
First,
we'll declare you bankrupt.

26:01.377 --> 26:03.921
Then we'll have
the bridge repaired,
then sell the estate...

26:04.005 --> 26:05.090
Yes, but...

26:05.174 --> 26:07.134
All very regrettable, of
course,

26:07.217 --> 26:10.930
but as you rejected our
very generous offer, tough.

26:14.351 --> 26:15.560
Okay.

26:18.397 --> 26:21.192
I'm sorry?
Did you say something?

26:21.275 --> 26:23.236
You win.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.405
I'll never sell Glenbogle.

26:29.077 --> 26:31.537
Look, will you just
tell me what happened?

26:31.621 --> 26:33.665
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

26:33.748 --> 26:36.710
I took your advice.
Just about the biggest
mistake of my life!

26:36.794 --> 26:38.295
What?

26:38.379 --> 26:40.631
I've no idea how horrendous
the consequences will be or,

26:40.715 --> 26:42.801
in fact, how I'm gonna live
with them.

26:42.884 --> 26:45.971
But, hey, that's what you get
for being stupid enough t
o listen to you, Alexandra.

26:46.054 --> 26:49.892
Archie, just listen to me.
I mean, I was only trying...

26:49.976 --> 26:52.520
Well, Katrina wasn't here
and you seemed quite low.

26:52.603 --> 26:55.607
-Look, Lex.
-You've disappointed me.
You really have.

26:55.691 --> 26:58.610
You're a... You're
an ungrateful, unfeeling...

27:01.155 --> 27:02.323
Lexie.

27:06.495 --> 27:08.414
So, Mr MacDonald,

27:08.497 --> 27:10.249
how exactly would you
characterise

27:10.332 --> 27:13.837
the state of industrial
relations here at Glenbogle?

27:18.884 --> 27:21.679
GOLLY: I'm telling you,
someone is
nobbling the committee.

27:21.762 --> 27:27.394
You see, old chap, you're a
Scot and therefore a pessimist
of the most lugubrious kind.

27:27.477 --> 27:30.315
-I could tell by
their voices on the phone.
-From what they said?

27:30.398 --> 27:33.693
What they didn't say.
From the... What do you
call it? The subtext.

27:33.776 --> 27:37.239
-Subtext?
-Look, look, look.
What did I tell you?

27:37.323 --> 27:41.119
So old Shuggs is having
a rockery laid, that's all.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.996
What? You're right.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.418
There he is, brazen.

27:47.501 --> 27:49.795
But old Shuggs isn't
interested in gardening.

27:49.879 --> 27:53.634
But Ma Shuggs is.
Alpines especially.

27:53.717 --> 27:57.429
See, Hector, she wears the
trousers, right? So he keeps
her happy with the flowers,

27:57.512 --> 28:00.892
that way he gets
to spend more time
with a five-iron in his fist.

28:00.975 --> 28:03.061
-Cunning.
-Mmm.

28:03.144 --> 28:05.397
HECTOR: It's too
cunning for Kilwillie, though.

28:05.481 --> 28:09.109
I think there's
a superior intelligence
at work, Golly.

28:09.193 --> 28:14.240
I'm a bit confused by some of
these cash-flow projections.
Perhaps you can enlighten me.

28:14.324 --> 28:17.203
I'm not sure I can,
it's Katrina's territory.

28:17.286 --> 28:20.247
Ah, yes, the girlfriend.
Better ask her, then.

28:20.331 --> 28:24.461
You might like to look at
this. If you can follow it.

28:24.544 --> 28:28.340
My recovery strategy.
The executive
summary's at the front.

28:33.137 --> 28:34.932
Mmm.

28:35.015 --> 28:39.186
Um, we need to
talk about exactly how
we're going to manage this.

28:39.603 --> 28:41.606
We?

28:41.690 --> 28:46.403
Mr MacDonald, this business is
deeper in debt
than when you arrived,

28:46.486 --> 28:49.782
its income lower,
its infrastructure
literally crumbling...

28:49.865 --> 28:51.534
That is unfair.

28:51.617 --> 28:55.247
You don't
understand basic accountancy,
you can't manage staff.

28:55.330 --> 28:57.791
If you want to
be really helpful,
take a long holiday.

28:57.874 --> 29:01.087
-Look...
-You are
the weakest link, goodbye.

29:01.170 --> 29:04.800
Between us, Katrina and I have
all the necessary
hands-on skills.

29:04.883 --> 29:07.761
-Well, I hope she's
got very long arms.
-Eh?

29:07.845 --> 29:10.932
She's off to Westminster.
This fax came through.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.226
I thought it was
for me from the bank.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.645
Something to do
with a new job.

29:19.066 --> 29:21.694
Oh, I'm sorry.
She didn't tell you?

29:25.365 --> 29:29.746
According to my canvassing,
he has three votes in the bag.

29:29.829 --> 29:31.748
Sheer bribery.

29:31.831 --> 29:35.377
Been showering the glen with
largesse like manure from
a muck-spreader.

29:35.461 --> 29:37.880
Oh, you have held on
to three votes yourself.

29:37.963 --> 29:41.551
-Good lads.
-The infirm,
the insane and the insensible.

29:41.634 --> 29:45.430
Please. Still makes three.
Now who has the casting vote?

29:45.513 --> 29:48.684
-One Robert McFadden.
-Bobby?

29:48.768 --> 29:50.895
-Mmm.
-Oh, marvellous chap.

29:52.063 --> 29:53.774
Is he still alive?

30:29.482 --> 30:31.818
-I'm sorry.
-So you should be.

30:34.112 --> 30:36.198
Stella's right.

30:36.281 --> 30:38.867
Maybe it is time
you had a new boss.

30:41.037 --> 30:45.667
-Is it that bad?
-It's not bad.
It's utterly catastrophic.

30:48.796 --> 30:50.881
Will you do me a favour
and get everyone together?

30:50.965 --> 30:54.803
I don't think I can
say this more than once.

30:54.886 --> 30:58.975
Look, don't punish yourself.

30:59.058 --> 31:04.230
It's only a job.
You've still got your
mates and...Katrina.

31:12.824 --> 31:15.327
(HECTOR GRUNTING)

31:23.378 --> 31:26.882
If we can tie old Bobby up,
metaphorically
speaking of course...

31:26.965 --> 31:29.844
Tomorrow we'll be
celebrating your inauguration.

31:29.927 --> 31:32.472
Exactly.

31:32.555 --> 31:37.186
Bobby, wake up, old man.
I have something of great
import to impart to you.

31:37.269 --> 31:41.858
Can I help you?
Visitors are asked to
check in at reception.

31:41.941 --> 31:47.281
This is a nursing home,
not a training ground
for ageing SAS operatives.

31:47.365 --> 31:52.913
Oh. We thought we'd give
the old chap a surprise.

31:52.996 --> 31:56.792
-I'm Bobby's son.
-No, you're not.
You're Hector MacDonald.

31:56.875 --> 32:01.673
Your vehicle once ran over
my foot when you mounted
the kerb at the Masonic Hall.

32:01.756 --> 32:03.549
You were in drink.

32:04.468 --> 32:05.761
Hello, Golly.

32:06.303 --> 32:08.389
Marion.

32:08.472 --> 32:11.893
Mr McFadden's real son
was here just
a short while ago.

32:11.976 --> 32:13.770
A most charming man.

32:14.729 --> 32:16.607
A most generous man.

32:16.691 --> 32:20.528
He made a substantial donation
to the staff's Christmas fund.

32:20.611 --> 32:24.825
Donation?
I have the whiff of
rodent in my nostrils, Golly.

32:24.908 --> 32:28.328
His wife was charming, too.
The acme of elegance.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.415
Kilwillie, with a woman?

32:31.374 --> 32:32.917
What was she like?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.837
Perfidious woman!

32:34.920 --> 32:39.466
You have stabbed me to the
quick, snuffed out my hopes.
O treachery!

32:39.550 --> 32:41.344
Oh, do be quiet, Hector.

32:41.428 --> 32:44.347
It's a golf club
we're talking about,
not the throne of Scotland.

32:44.431 --> 32:47.476
ARCHIE: Can I have
some quiet, please?

32:47.560 --> 32:49.979
I have something
to tell you all.

32:50.062 --> 32:51.439
What is it?

32:53.066 --> 32:55.861
It looks like I am
gonna be leaving you.

32:55.944 --> 32:57.904
W-Why?

32:57.988 --> 33:00.408
Because it's the only way
the bank can be stopped
from pulling out

33:00.491 --> 33:02.243
and bringing
the whole place down.

33:02.326 --> 33:05.247
I've made my case to Stella
but she won't be moved,

33:05.330 --> 33:08.584
and ultimately she
has the whip hand.

33:08.667 --> 33:10.462
This can't happen, Arch.

33:10.545 --> 33:15.717
Well,
it's either me or the estate.
So that's it, I am out.

33:16.927 --> 33:18.929
Archie? What is it?

33:22.642 --> 33:24.478
Archie, I'm so sorry.

33:29.233 --> 33:31.903
What are you going to do?

33:31.986 --> 33:34.072
I have absolutely no idea.

33:35.407 --> 33:37.951
Maybe I'll come
to London with you.

33:39.286 --> 33:41.915
This came for you.

33:41.998 --> 33:45.168
-Archie,
I know what you're thinking.
-Congratulations.

33:45.251 --> 33:47.797
The job you've
always dreamed of.

33:47.880 --> 33:51.217
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because I had no
intention of taking it.

33:51.300 --> 33:54.888
Oh, really? That's not
what Mary McBride thinks.

33:54.971 --> 33:57.599
"I know that you really
wanna grab this opportunity
with both hands,

33:57.682 --> 34:00.978
"and I can't wait to begin
what I am sure will be
a great partnership."

34:01.062 --> 34:02.563
-Archie.
-I thought that's what we had,

34:02.647 --> 34:04.692
-a great partnership.
-Will you just shut up?

34:04.775 --> 34:07.277
She's just trying to
persuade me to take the job.

34:07.361 --> 34:09.029
Oh, you need to be persuaded?

34:09.112 --> 34:13.743
Archie, a few months ago
I would have bitten her
hand off. But not now.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.873
I've got everything
I want right here.

34:18.791 --> 34:21.627
Yeah?

34:21.710 --> 34:26.091
Did you think I was gonna
leave you and go to London,
especially now?

34:29.512 --> 34:30.638
Okay.

34:34.643 --> 34:38.938
So what did she say
when you finally
turned her down?

34:39.022 --> 34:42.027
Well, I haven't
actually told her yet.

34:42.110 --> 34:44.404
-You're still
thinking about it?
-Yeah.

34:44.487 --> 34:46.614
Well, no. Archie, stop it.

34:48.659 --> 34:51.786
All that I have
worked for this last year,
all that I have fought for,

34:51.871 --> 34:55.292
have been the two things
that I care about most,
this place and us.

34:55.375 --> 34:58.128
I'm wondering
now why I bothered.

34:58.211 --> 35:01.674
You have no faith in me,
do you? No trust.

35:01.758 --> 35:05.345
First sign of trouble
and you just write me off.
Thanks, Archie.

35:15.315 --> 35:16.525
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

35:16.609 --> 35:18.194
LEXIE: Molly?

35:23.533 --> 35:25.577
We can't let this happen.

35:48.854 --> 35:50.064
Duncan!

35:55.570 --> 35:57.114
Duncan!

36:11.588 --> 36:13.425
Get in there, girl.

36:18.139 --> 36:21.516
-This is not right.
-Whose side are you on?

36:21.600 --> 36:25.313
Oh, don't answer that.
You love-sick bampot.

36:33.906 --> 36:36.160
Duncan!

36:36.243 --> 36:38.704
We haven't got permission
from the escape committee,

36:38.787 --> 36:41.875
but I'm sure you'll
enjoy a little excursion.
Eh, Bobby?

36:41.958 --> 36:43.835
BOBBY: Oh, dear.

36:43.918 --> 36:48.090
Especially in
the noble cause of democracy.

36:48.174 --> 36:49.258
Hey!

36:50.259 --> 36:52.094
BOBBY: Oh, dear.

36:52.179 --> 36:55.182
KILWILLIE:
I'm sure you're going to
enjoy your day out, Bobby.

36:55.265 --> 36:57.642
I'll just park you
here for a minute.

36:57.726 --> 37:00.813
Have you ever travelled
in one of these things, Bobby?

37:00.897 --> 37:03.858
-Oh, dear.
-Rather marvellous beasts.

37:03.941 --> 37:06.361
KILWILLIE: I'm afraid they put
that thing of yours to shame.

37:06.445 --> 37:08.781
What? Hector!

37:11.951 --> 37:13.495
(GROANING)

37:24.132 --> 37:25.425
Hello again.

37:25.509 --> 37:28.846
I've never actually
encountered a stalker before,

37:28.930 --> 37:33.643
but on the basis of what
I've heard, this is a pretty
weird obsession.

37:52.081 --> 37:53.708
Give us a break.

37:58.673 --> 37:59.841
Lexie!

38:33.004 --> 38:34.590
Oh, yes.

38:39.386 --> 38:40.805
So?

38:40.889 --> 38:43.391
You might be
wondering why we put on
this little pantomime.

38:43.475 --> 38:45.435
A bit of
a laugh at my expense?

38:45.518 --> 38:50.149
Nothing so childish.
Oh,
here, dear, you must be cold.

38:50.232 --> 38:51.734
Thank you, Molly.

38:51.817 --> 38:54.029
We thought we'd give you
a little taste of
what it'll be like

38:54.112 --> 38:56.156
if you carry on with
this foolishness.

38:56.239 --> 38:58.242
GOLLY:
And it's not just the house.

38:58.326 --> 39:01.913
There's 39,000 acres
of forest, moor and mountain
that needs looking after.

39:01.996 --> 39:04.166
-You mean...
-If Archie goes...

39:04.249 --> 39:05.584
We all go.

39:08.629 --> 39:10.131
ARCHIE: Hi.

39:12.258 --> 39:14.385
Just packing up some stuff.

39:16.764 --> 39:21.644
Look, I'm sorry about
last night. I said some things
I shouldn't have.

39:21.727 --> 39:25.315
I can only plead
mitigating circumstances.

39:25.398 --> 39:28.319
But, you know,
rows are sometimes
good for relationships,

39:28.402 --> 39:31.405
you come through them
a stronger and better couple.

39:31.489 --> 39:34.284
-Cobblers.
-What?

39:34.368 --> 39:36.120
This document of hers.

39:36.203 --> 39:39.248
The assumptions behind
some of the figures,
they just seem...

39:39.331 --> 39:42.210
Is this hers?
Let's have a squint.

39:42.293 --> 39:43.753
Katrina, you can't.

39:43.837 --> 39:47.216
What's she gonna do?
Sue me for
industrial espionage?

39:51.011 --> 39:55.225
Right, if you'll excuse me,
I have things to do.

39:55.308 --> 39:58.271
Before I go, I've got one
thing to say to you.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.522
Yes?

39:59.605 --> 40:02.692
I know you. You need to win.

40:02.775 --> 40:07.281
But just
reflect on this, lass,
you can't have everything.

40:07.364 --> 40:11.494
I mean, if you did,
where would you put it?

40:14.122 --> 40:18.669
You must see, dear, this stand
of ours, anything else just
wouldn't be right.

40:18.753 --> 40:21.422
You do the dirty on my boy
and you're history, Miss Goon.

40:21.505 --> 40:24.551
Moon. You too, Duncan?

40:26.428 --> 40:27.679
Well...

40:29.515 --> 40:31.058
Aye, afraid so.

40:32.059 --> 40:33.811
You see, Stella,

40:33.895 --> 40:36.398
anybody who knows anything
about Archie knows what a

40:36.482 --> 40:38.484
difference he's made
around here.

40:38.567 --> 40:42.071
His flair, his energy, his
ability to get the best out
of people. His...

40:42.155 --> 40:44.616
Oh, yeah? Fancy him, do you?

40:44.699 --> 40:46.535
ARCHIE: Good morning.

40:46.619 --> 40:49.371
How is life at
the cutting edge
of management theory?

40:49.455 --> 40:52.751
You just missed
the workers' revolt.
You go, they go, apparently.

40:52.834 --> 40:56.797
Oh, thanks, everyone, but,
please, don't throw away your
futures on my account.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.841
I have plenty of
other irons in the fire.

40:58.925 --> 41:01.761
Well, yes, it would be a shame
but it's not
the end of the world.

41:01.844 --> 41:03.805
They can all be replaced.

41:03.888 --> 41:07.851
Yeah, so I read. At a cost
more or less equal to
the national debt of Bolivia.

41:07.935 --> 41:10.105
Get to the point,
Mr MacDonald.

41:10.188 --> 41:14.526
The thing is, the coup d'etat
may have been a total success,
and I congratulate you,

41:14.609 --> 41:18.364
but I do think the new regime
may not last very long,

41:18.447 --> 41:21.909
if this is anything to go by.

41:21.993 --> 41:24.329
Would you all
leave Archie and me
for a moment, please?

41:24.412 --> 41:26.915
Katrina stays.
She's part of this.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.637
Okay, what you got?

41:43.435 --> 41:46.230
Your figures are
all up the Suwannee.

41:46.313 --> 41:49.525
-No, they're not.
-Not just wages, all
the estimates for suppliers,

41:49.608 --> 41:53.238
food, gifts in the Visitors'
Centre, even loo rolls,
all way over the top.

41:53.321 --> 41:56.199
I can defend everything.
They're perfectly
reasonable estimates.

41:56.283 --> 41:59.162
They would be
if you made them in
an office in London.

41:59.245 --> 42:01.456
But not for up here,
they're way too high.

42:01.539 --> 42:05.169
Which is why you've had
to inflate the income targets
to match the budget.

42:05.252 --> 42:09.381
And you'll never meet them.
You won't last a year.

42:09.465 --> 42:12.302
Do you wanna know
what I'd do with this?

42:17.558 --> 42:19.435
So you think you
can do better, do you?

42:19.518 --> 42:23.064
I didn't say that.
I'm sure you have
many excellent qualities.

42:23.148 --> 42:25.358
Local knowledge
isn't one of them.

42:25.442 --> 42:30.156
Well, maybe there's a way of
synthesising my
approach with yours.

42:34.828 --> 42:37.581
Last evening,
sitting after dinner,

42:37.664 --> 42:39.374
a glass of
Armagnac at my elbow,

42:39.458 --> 42:42.754
musing about what
I was going to say
to you lot today,

42:42.837 --> 42:49.762
I started to think about the
relationship between
a president and his people.

42:49.845 --> 42:54.100
And I was suddenly struck
by the curious parallels

42:54.184 --> 42:58.606
between my own life and
that of Nelson Mandela.

42:58.689 --> 43:03.653
We were both imprisoned for
many years in the struggle
for liberation.

43:03.736 --> 43:07.574
In my case, from my late wife,
a woman of uncertain temper.

43:09.869 --> 43:16.085
Mr Mandela is
known throughout Africa
simply as The Father.

43:16.168 --> 43:19.964
And perhaps you could
come to think of me like that,

43:20.047 --> 43:26.680
as you sip these libations
provided at cost by Kilwillie
Distilleries and Ales Limited,

43:26.763 --> 43:32.270
or when you enjoy
a subsidised trip
to the next Open Championship.

43:32.353 --> 43:38.652
Maybe you could just
raise a glass and say,
"Thank you, Daddy."

43:41.030 --> 43:42.365
Eh, Bobby?

43:52.961 --> 43:54.296
I'm sorry.

43:56.131 --> 43:59.635
You'll have to put up with me
for a little bit longer.

43:59.719 --> 44:01.137
What did she say?

44:01.220 --> 44:04.933
Er, we'll work together
under her overall authority,

44:05.017 --> 44:07.895
but the bridge'll be repaired
immediately and we can all
get going again.

44:07.978 --> 44:10.023
She's in charge and
you're the underling?

44:10.106 --> 44:13.234
Well, it's not gonna be easy,
in fact it's probably
gonna be a nightmare,

44:13.318 --> 44:17.656
but I really wanna push ahead
with everything that we
planned, and win it all back.

44:17.740 --> 44:19.700
I see your strategy.

44:19.783 --> 44:21.786
Long game, secret war.

44:21.870 --> 44:24.206
We shall fight her on the
beaches, we shall fight
her in the hills.

44:24.289 --> 44:27.042
-And in the kitchens.
-We shall never surrender.
How exciting.

44:27.125 --> 44:29.504
Come on, Hector,
you've a public
statement to make.

44:29.587 --> 44:33.466
More fun than
running a golf club.
You can count on me, boy.

44:33.549 --> 44:37.971
Lexie,
are we allowed to like her
as well as fight her?

44:38.055 --> 44:40.975
Oh, shut up. Well done, Arch.

44:51.737 --> 44:53.198
It's typical.

44:53.281 --> 44:56.409
Can't even be
bothered to turn up.

44:56.493 --> 45:01.666
But we do have his address.
Perhaps Golly would like
to entertain us with it?

45:03.794 --> 45:06.964
I think we'd just
better wait for himself.

45:07.047 --> 45:11.803
Oh, come on, Golly, you're not
afraid to stand on your
own two feet, surely?

45:13.930 --> 45:15.306
All right.

45:21.564 --> 45:24.359
Right. Uh...

45:24.442 --> 45:30.116
"From an early age,
I have been destined
to bear the burden of command.

45:30.199 --> 45:32.493
"In the nursery,
my governess Quint,

45:32.577 --> 45:37.124
"a sturdy female who had
worked for many years in
a women's prison,

45:37.207 --> 45:40.962
"instilled, by the force
of her
considerable personality,

45:41.045 --> 45:44.591
"a keen appreciation of
order and discipline."

45:44.674 --> 45:46.969
Aha! My worthy opponent.

45:47.052 --> 45:49.847
Sorry, I just dropped
round to say I'm pulling out.

45:49.930 --> 45:51.850
Yes!

45:51.933 --> 45:55.479
Pressing estate business.
Terribly sorry.
Best man wins and all that.

45:55.562 --> 46:02.236
Just couldn't compete with
you, Kilwillie. What a
generous fellow you are.

46:02.320 --> 46:05.741
ARCHIE: I'd never
have done it without you.
KATRINA: Yes, you would.

46:05.824 --> 46:07.868
Maybe in a different way.

46:10.079 --> 46:12.248
What am I gonna do, Archie?

46:17.338 --> 46:19.840
You think I should take
the job, don't you?

46:19.924 --> 46:22.802
I don't know. Honestly,
I don't.

46:22.886 --> 46:27.390
Well, I'm not.
I'm staying here with you.

46:27.474 --> 46:30.895
-Good.
-I mean, you're my man.

46:30.978 --> 46:33.022
It was just a job, right?

46:34.024 --> 46:35.609
Well, a career.

46:38.862 --> 46:40.740
What are you thinking?

46:43.660 --> 46:46.372
I'm just taking it all in.

46:46.455 --> 46:50.584
I know it's the kind of
job you've dreamed of.

46:50.668 --> 46:54.673
And giving it up for me,
it makes me feel...

46:54.756 --> 46:58.386
I don't know, it makes
me think how lucky I am.

46:58.469 --> 46:59.929
So?

47:02.014 --> 47:04.560
But I'm thinking
of the future, too.

47:05.686 --> 47:07.688
About us in a year.

47:07.771 --> 47:11.860
You still supply teaching,
travelling to
Inverness every day.

47:11.943 --> 47:15.739
Or being Mrs Laird,
opening sports
days and church fetes.

47:17.825 --> 47:19.618
I'm wondering if you'll
still feel the same then.

47:19.702 --> 47:22.289
Don't say that. It
sounds like you want me to go.

47:22.372 --> 47:25.000
Oh, no,
I don't, believe me I don't.

47:26.668 --> 47:28.754
But you really want that job.

47:34.428 --> 47:37.097
-It's so unfair.
-What?

47:40.018 --> 47:46.025
You spend your life looking
for the person that's perfect
for you in every way,

47:46.108 --> 47:51.238
and then you find them
and it's wonderful for
a short time, and then...

47:53.825 --> 47:57.162
And then the world tells
you you can't have her.

48:06.006 --> 48:08.467
Oh,
Archie, what are we gonna do?

48:11.054 --> 48:15.976
Do you think it could work,
you here and me down there?

48:16.060 --> 48:19.438
You've already had one
long distance relationship.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.359
Yeah, I've had that.

48:24.361 --> 48:26.071
What do you think?

48:29.951 --> 48:32.995
I feel like
something's quietly dying.

48:40.505 --> 48:42.173
Is that it, then?

49:03.699 --> 49:06.285
HECTOR: Costly business,
politics, eh, Kilwillie?

49:06.368 --> 49:08.537
Are you sure this is right?

49:08.620 --> 49:11.708
Well, you'd better
take it then, hadn't you?

49:13.459 --> 49:15.796
-MOLLY: Kilwillie.
-Molly?

49:15.880 --> 49:19.842
The girls and I
congratulate you
on your great victory.

49:19.925 --> 49:22.345
And we so look
forward to working with you,

49:22.429 --> 49:26.349
as you bend to the task
of delivering your
solemn commitments.

49:26.433 --> 49:30.229
-My what?
-Ensuring that our
management committee,

49:30.313 --> 49:34.151
represents all the members
and not just
the old dinosaurs,

49:34.234 --> 49:36.820
regardless of age and gender,

49:36.904 --> 49:41.701
putting an end to
such patronising concepts
as ladies' days.

49:41.784 --> 49:45.288
-I don't know if I can...
-And all the other
conditions I imposed on you

49:45.371 --> 49:49.376
when you asked me to help
you cheat, bully and bribe
your way to the top.

49:49.460 --> 49:52.547
But if you want to
wriggle out of them,

49:52.631 --> 49:57.762
I'm sure your voters will be
most interested to hear of
your electoral malpractices.

50:00.932 --> 50:03.936
Well, of course I managed it.

50:04.019 --> 50:10.235
Yeah, the old trick. I got him
to cooperate by threatening
with something much worse.

50:10.318 --> 50:12.362
Yeah, I soon got
him kicked into line.

50:12.445 --> 50:15.658
Well, he's a toff.
They don't like
it up 'em, do they?

50:15.741 --> 50:17.701
Thank you very much.

50:17.785 --> 50:20.079
Bye. Oh, my God!

50:21.247 --> 50:22.374
Oh!

50:23.959 --> 50:25.252
Duncan!

50:27.087 --> 50:30.758
-Duncan!
-No, no, leave her be.

50:30.841 --> 50:32.176
Help!

50:32.260 --> 50:33.971
That one needs to learn
the first rule
of life up here.

50:34.054 --> 50:35.764
What's that?

50:35.847 --> 50:38.976
-You come into this
world naked, wet and cold.
-Duncan!

50:39.059 --> 50:42.230
-DUNCAN: Aye.
-And then things
really get bad.

50:42.313 --> 50:43.940
Duncan!

50:49.154 --> 50:51.198
Duncan!

50:56.830 --> 50:58.040
Duncan!
