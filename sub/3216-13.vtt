Sammy.

00:03.713 --> 00:06.257
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Go!

00:10.052 --> 00:11.470
DEAN:
Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.347
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:16.976 --> 00:17.935
DEAN:
This is Dad's book.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.937
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:20.146 --> 00:22.106
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.983
The family business.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.109
I gotta find Dad.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.986
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:35.161 --> 00:37.413
MAN (ON RADIO):
With temperatures hitting below zero...

00:37.621 --> 00:40.916
...we've got an unseasonably cold front
setting throughout the county.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.336
We've got some pretty rough going
reportedly on I-55...

00:44.545 --> 00:47.923
...with winds out of the north
at 40 miles an hour--

00:48.132 --> 00:49.175
(STATIC OVER RADIO)

01:02.605 --> 01:04.273
What the...?

01:28.172 --> 01:31.467
MAN (ON RADIO): Republicans are
$10 billion away from a budget deal...

01:31.675 --> 01:35.221
...fighting over what seems
like a ton of money....

(TRUCK ENGINE REVVING)

02:14.218 --> 02:15.803
(SCREAMS)

02:52.548 --> 02:55.718
I think I found a way we can bypass
that construction east of here.

02:55.968 --> 02:59.179
We might even make Pennsylvania
faster than we thought.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.681
Yeah.

03:00.890 --> 03:03.517
The problem is, we're not
going to Pennsylvania.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.311
We what?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.188
I just got a call from an old friend.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.649
Her father was killed,
might be our kind of thing.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.444
-What?
-Yeah. Believe me...

03:14.320 --> 03:17.531
...she never would've called, never,
if she didn't need us.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.452
Come on. You coming or what?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.965
By "old friend," you mean...?

03:35.174 --> 03:36.967
A friend that's not new.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.677
Yeah, thanks.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.430
So her name's Cassie, huh?

03:41.639 --> 03:43.474
You never mentioned her.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.184
-Didn't I?
-No.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.770
-Yeah, we went out.
-You mean you dated somebody?

03:47.978 --> 03:50.481
For more than one night?

03:51.106 --> 03:53.525
Am I speaking a language
you're not getting here?

03:53.609 --> 03:55.569
Dad and I were working a job in Ohio.

03:55.778 --> 03:59.198
She was finishing up college.
We went out for a couple of weeks.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.742
And...?

04:04.119 --> 04:05.913
Look, it's terrible about her dad...

04:06.121 --> 04:08.499
...but kind of sounds
like a standard car accident.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.793
I'm not seeing how it fits
with what we do.

04:11.627 --> 04:15.130
Which, by the way,
how does she know what we do?

04:18.634 --> 04:21.762
You told her.
You told her, the secret.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.639
Our big family rule number one:

04:23.722 --> 04:25.808
We do what we do
and we shut up about it.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.143
For a year I do nothing
but lie to Jessica.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.771
You go out with this chick
in Ohio a couple times...

04:30.980 --> 04:33.273
...and you tell her everything?

04:34.149 --> 04:36.610
-Dean.
-Yeah. Looks like.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.952
MAN: It's a newspaper we put out,
not a bulletin for the mayor's office.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.081
Get off your soap box, Jimmy.
I'm urging a little discretion, is all.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.709
I think you're telling us
what you want us to print...

04:51.792 --> 04:54.086
...and what you want us to sit on.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.796
I know you're upset, Cassie.

04:56.005 --> 04:58.215
I liked your dad a lot...

04:58.424 --> 05:00.843
...but I think your grief
is clouding your judgment.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.678
Two black people were killed...

05:02.761 --> 05:05.097
...on the road in the same way
in three weeks.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.433
TODD:
Jimmy, you're too close to this.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.685
Those guys were friends of yours.

05:10.936 --> 05:15.232
Again, I'm very sorry for your loss.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.077
Dean.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.871
Hey, Cassie.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.796
This is my brother, Sam.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.344
-I'm sorry about your dad.
-Yeah.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.097
Me too.

05:51.226 --> 05:54.563
My mother's in pretty bad shape.
I've been staying with her.

05:54.772 --> 05:59.109
I wish she wouldn't go off by herself.
She's been so nervous and frightened.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.488
-She was worried about Dad.
-Why?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.449
-He was scared. He was seeing things.
-Like what?

06:05.657 --> 06:09.453
He swore he saw an awful-looking
black truck following him.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.789
A truck? Who was the driver?

06:11.872 --> 06:15.292
He didn't talk about a driver.
Just the truck.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.753
He said it would appear and disappear.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.464
And, in the accident,
Dad's truck was dented...

06:20.672 --> 06:23.884
...like it'd been slammed into
by something big.

06:24.093 --> 06:27.721
Thanks. Now, you're sure
this dent wasn't there before?

06:27.930 --> 06:30.933
He sold cars. Always drove a new one.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.060
There wasn't a scratch on that thing.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.146
It had rained hard that night.
There was mud everywhere.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.274
There was a distinct set
of muddy tracks...

06:39.483 --> 06:42.736
...from Dad's car leading right...

06:43.862 --> 06:46.532
...to the edge where he went over.

06:48.659 --> 06:51.286
One set of tracks. His.

06:51.787 --> 06:55.374
-The first was a friend of your father's?
-Best friend. Clayton Soames.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.960
They owned
the car dealership together.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.921
Same thing. Dent. No tracks.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.799
And the cops said exactly
what they said about Dad:

07:03.882 --> 07:05.384
"He lost control of his car."

07:05.592 --> 07:08.512
Any reason why your father
and his partner might be targets?

07:08.720 --> 07:11.890
-No.
-This truck ran them off the road?

07:12.099 --> 07:15.310
When you say it aloud like that....

07:16.145 --> 07:20.983
Listen, I'm a little skeptical
about this ghost stuff...

07:21.984 --> 07:24.319
...or whatever it is you guys are into.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.739
Skeptical? If I remember,
I think you said I was nuts.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.450
-That was then.
-Hmm.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.373
I just know I can't explain
what happened up there.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.375
So I called you.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.128
Mom.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.880
Where have you been? I was....

07:42.963 --> 07:46.592
I had no idea
you had invited friends over.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.888
Mom, this is Dean,
a friend of mine from college.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.224
And his brother, Sam.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.436
Well, I won't interrupt you.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.854
Mrs. Robinson.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.149
We're sorry for your loss.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.110
We'd like to talk to you for a minute,
if you don't mind.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.989
I'm really not up to that just now.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.073
(ENGINE REVVING)

09:05.087 --> 09:06.797
TODD:
Jimmy meant something to this town.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.342
He was one of our best.
We won't be the same without him.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.262
Our best seem to be dropping like flies.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.098
Clayton, my father, Jimmy.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.809
What is it exactly you want me to do?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.937
How about closing
this section of road, for starters.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.065
Close the main road,
the only road in and out of town?

09:25.899 --> 09:29.861
Accidents do happen, Cassie.
That's what they are. Accidents.

09:29.945 --> 09:33.073
Did the cops check for additional
denting? See if it was pushed?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.826
-Who's this?
-Dean and Sam Winchester.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.496
Family friends.
This is Mayor Harold Todd.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.707
There's one set of tire tracks. One.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.792
TODD:
Doesn't point to foul play.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.962
CASSIE: Mayor, the police and town
officials take their cues from you.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.922
-If you're indifferent--
-Indifferent?

09:49.131 --> 09:52.009
Would you close the road
if the victims were white?

09:53.093 --> 09:56.096
You suggesting I'm racist, Cassie.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.307
I'm the last person
you should talk to like that.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.933
And why is that?

10:00.309 --> 10:02.519
Why don't you ask your mother?

10:07.357 --> 10:10.694
I'll say this for her, she's fearless.

10:10.944 --> 10:11.945
Mm-hm.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.157
Bet she kicked your ass
a couple times.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.953
What's interesting is, you guys never
look at each other at the same time.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.497
You look at her
when she's not looking...

10:22.706 --> 10:24.791
...she checks you out
when you look away.

10:27.502 --> 10:31.631
It's just an interesting observation
in a, you know...

10:31.882 --> 10:33.800
...observationally interesting way.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.511
You think we might have
more pressing issues here?

10:37.346 --> 10:38.889
Hey, if I'm hitting a nerve--

10:39.306 --> 10:41.016
Let's go.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.367
Excuse me, are you Ron Stubbins?

10:58.575 --> 11:00.202
You were friends
with Jimmy Anderson?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.954
-Who are you?
-Mr. Anderson's insurance company.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.664
Here to dot I's and cross T's.

11:04.915 --> 11:08.752
We were wondering, had the deceased
mentioned any unusual experiences?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.923
-What do you mean, "unusual"?
-Well, visions, hallucinations.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.343
It's all part of a medical examination
kind of thing. Very standard.

11:16.551 --> 11:20.305
-What company you say you're with?
-All National Mutual.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.851
Tell me, did he ever mention
seeing a truck? Big, black truck?

11:25.060 --> 11:28.271
What the hell you talking about?
You even speaking English?

11:28.480 --> 11:31.817
Son, this truck,
a big, scary monster-looking thing?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.235
Yeah, actually, I think so.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.487
Hmm.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.907
-What?
-I have heard of a truck like that.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.826
You have?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.286
-Where?
-Not where, when.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.790
Back in the '60s,
there was a string of deaths.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.667
Black men.

11:49.167 --> 11:53.422
Story goes, they disappeared
in a big, nasty black truck.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.800
-They ever catch the guy who did it?
-Never found him.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.720
Hell, not sure they even really looked.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.014
See, there was a time...

12:04.266 --> 12:09.062
...this town wasn't too friendly
to all its citizens.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.109
Thank you.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.407
-Truck.
-Keeps coming up, doesn't it?

12:20.615 --> 12:23.076
I was thinking.
You heard of the Flying Dutchman?

12:23.285 --> 12:27.330
Yeah, a ghost ship, infused with
the captain's spirit. It was part of him.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.167
So, what if we're dealing
with a phantom truck?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.253
The extension of some bastard ghost
re-enacting past crimes.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.464
The victims have all been black men.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.050
I think it's more than that.
They all seem connected to Cassie.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.344
All right. Well, you work that angle.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.096
-Go talk to her.
-Yeah, I will.

12:43.305 --> 12:46.183
Oh, and, you might also
want to mention that other thing.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.103
-What other thing?
-The serious unfinished business.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.771
(CHUCKLES)

12:52.189 --> 12:55.150
Dean, what is going on
between you two?

12:55.734 --> 12:58.153
We were a little bit
more involved than I said.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.322
Oh, okay.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.866
Okay, a lot more. Maybe.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.911
I told her the secret about what we do
and I shouldn't have.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.914
Look, man, everybody's gotta
open up to someone sometime.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.332
Yeah, I don't.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.460
It was stupid to get that close.
I mean, look how it ended.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.130
Would you stop?

13:18.507 --> 13:20.509
Blink or something.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.719
You loved her.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.930
Oh, God.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.724
You were in love with her,
but you dumped her?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.312
Oh, wow.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.483
She dumped you.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.527
Get in the car.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.695
Get in the car.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.368
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:56.336 --> 13:57.504
CASSIE: Dean.
-Hey.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.966
Hey. Come on in.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.179
So you busy or...?

14:06.388 --> 14:08.181
The paper's doing a tribute to Jimmy.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.935
Uh, I was just going
through his stuff...

14:12.143 --> 14:14.020
...his awards.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.356
Trying to find the words.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.736
-That's gotta be tough.
-This family owned the paper.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.447
The Dorians?
They had a whites-only staff policy.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.617
After they sold it,
Jimmy became the first black reporter.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.829
He didn't stop until he became editor.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.373
He taught me everything.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.000
Where's your brother?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.254
Not here.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.756
All right. So, what brings you here?

14:41.965 --> 14:43.842
Trying to find the connection.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.137
By the way, did you talk to your mom
about Todd not being racist?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.638
I did.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.891
-She didn't wanna talk about it.
-Right.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.189
So just then,
why'd you ask where my brother was?

14:58.857 --> 15:01.484
-Nothing. Not important.
-Because without him here...

15:01.693 --> 15:03.695
...it's you and me,
not you, me and Sam...

15:03.903 --> 15:06.364
-...which would be easier?
-It's not easier.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.867
-Look, I--
-No. Forget it. It's fine.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.870
We'll keep it strictly business.

33:53.198 --> 33:56.618
-What are we doing?
-Uh, let me get back to you.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.539
Hey, Cassie? Hey, it's Sam.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.709
Okay, I need some information
and it has to be exactly right.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.589
SAM: All right.
-This better be good.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.841
-Where are you?
-The middle of nowhere...

34:11.049 --> 34:14.261
...with a killer truck on my ass.
It knows I put the torch to Cyrus.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.222
Listen. It's important.
I have to know exactly where you are.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.725
Decatur Road, about two miles
off the highway.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.518
-Okay. Headed east?
-Yes!

34:28.025 --> 34:30.986
-You son of a bitch.
-Okay, turn right.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.613
Up ahead, turn right.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.537
-You make the turn?
DEAN (ON PHONE): I made it.

34:40.788 --> 34:43.999
-Move this thing along a little faster.
-You see a road up ahead?

34:44.249 --> 34:46.001
No. Wait.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.836
-Yes. I see it.
-Okay, turn left.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.797
What?

34:56.386 --> 34:58.847
-All right. Now what?
-Go seven-tenths of a mile...

34:59.097 --> 35:00.307
-...and stop.
-Stop?

35:00.557 --> 35:02.476
Exactly seven-tenths, Dean.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.770
Seven-tenths, seven-tenths.

35:36.343 --> 35:37.678
-Dean, you still there?
-Yeah.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.847
-What's happening?
-It's staring at me.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.723
-What do I do?
-What you are doing.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.309
-Bringing it to you.
-Yeah.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.603
(ENGINE REVVING)

36:01.410 --> 36:02.870
Come on. Come on.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.768
Dean? You still there?

36:27.769 --> 36:29.563
Dean.

36:31.315 --> 36:35.360
-Where did it go?
-Dean, you're where the church was.

36:35.444 --> 36:38.363
-What church?
-The place Cyrus burned down.

36:38.572 --> 36:40.782
-Murdered those kids.
-There's not a lot left.

36:41.033 --> 36:44.036
Church ground is hallowed,
whether the church is there or not.

36:44.286 --> 36:47.789
Evil spirits cross over hallowed ground,
sometimes they're destroyed.

36:48.081 --> 36:52.210
So I figured maybe
that would get rid of it.

36:52.419 --> 36:55.172
Maybe? Maybe?

36:55.923 --> 36:58.884
-What if you were wrong?
-Huh.

37:00.177 --> 37:02.429
Honestly, that thought
hadn't occurred to me.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.810
"Well, it honestly didn't occur to me."

37:14.942 --> 37:16.485
I'm gonna kill him.

37:25.202 --> 37:28.580
My mother says to tell you
thanks again.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.712
This is a better goodbye
than last time.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.799
Yeah, well, maybe this time
it'll be a little less permanent.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.094
You know what?

37:43.220 --> 37:45.472
I'm a realist.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.558
I don't see much hope for us, Dean.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.606
Well, I've seen stranger things happen.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.608
Hell of a lot stranger.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.240
Goodbye, Dean.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.285
I'll see you, Cassie.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.287
I will.

39:01.631 --> 39:05.260
-I like her.
-Yeah.

39:08.221 --> 39:12.184
You meet someone like her,
ever make you wonder if it's worth it...

39:12.434 --> 39:16.354
...putting everything else on hold,
doing what we do?

39:29.826 --> 39:33.080
Why don't you wake me up
when it's my turn to drive?

39:35.040 --> 39:36.833
