00:01.601 --> 00:05.833
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.905 --> 00:08.840
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.908 --> 00:10.899
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.415 --> 00:18.111
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.184 --> 00:21.711
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.788 --> 00:27.021
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:32.360
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.432 --> 00:36.801
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:41.034
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:41.107 --> 00:44.042
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.110 --> 00:46.738
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:46.813 --> 00:48.804
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:51.618 --> 00:55.452
Oh, you're so lucky.
I would just kill for your job.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.286
You would?
What's she like?

00:58.358 --> 01:00.588
I mean, really like- in private?

01:00.660 --> 01:04.426
Uh, well, she's, uh-
she's a little hard to describe.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.933
Spending every day with her,
getting to know the real person-

01:08.001 --> 01:09.992
<i>Yeah.
Here she comes!</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:14.507
We love you! We love you!
Marilyn? Miss Monroe?

01:23.049 --> 01:26.018
<i>Stay back there, please.
Marilyn?</i>

01:33.193 --> 01:35.753
Come on, Dennis.
Take me away from all this.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.161
Oh, boy.

02:55.475 --> 02:58.239
<i>Some quantum leaps
are like nightmares-</i>

02:58.311 --> 03:01.906
<i>getting pummeled in a boxing ring,
working on a chain gang-</i>

03:01.981 --> 03:04.916
<i>so if you'd told me I'd find myself
chauffeuring Marilyn Monroe...</i>

03:04.984 --> 03:07.919
<i>around Hollywood
in a big V8 convertible,</i>

03:07.987 --> 03:10.581
<i>I'd say I'd died and gone to heaven.</i>

03:10.657 --> 03:12.750
<i>I was only a kid when Marilyn
was at her peak,</i>

03:12.825 --> 03:16.090
<i>but in college I used to love
sneaking off to the movies...</i>

03:16.162 --> 03:20.565
<i>so I could get lost in the magic
of those big, luscious blue eyes.</i>

03:20.633 --> 03:23.602
<i>Al, on the other hand,
had been around for the real thing-</i>

03:23.670 --> 03:26.161
<i>Marilyn's sensational marriages
and love affairs,</i>

03:26.239 --> 03:28.173
<i>her tours with the troops,</i>

03:28.241 --> 03:31.074
<i>her meteoric rise
and her sudden, tragic fall.</i>

03:31.144 --> 03:33.942
<i>Right now, though,
everything seemed fine.</i>

03:34.013 --> 03:36.277
<i>Marilyn was getting ready
to start her next big picture,</i>

03:36.349 --> 03:38.613
<i>and she was on top of the world.</i>

03:38.685 --> 03:41.381
<i>Something in her eyes,
something in her voice...</i>

03:41.454 --> 03:44.048
<i>told me she was a woman in trouble,</i>

03:44.123 --> 03:47.559
<i>and I wonderedjust how far away we were
from the dark day the world would lose...</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:49.561
<i>one of its brightest stars-</i>

03:49.629 --> 03:52.291
<i>the day we all lost Marilyn Monroe.</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:05.408
Dennis, be a sweetie
and grab the mail, okay?

04:05.478 --> 04:07.912
Okay.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.253
<i>Al.</i>

04:15.321 --> 04:17.516
Al, what am I doing here?

04:17.589 --> 04:19.649
Who cares?
"Who cares?"

04:19.726 --> 04:22.695
Oh, no. I mean
- I mean, who knows? I mean, we don't know yet.

04:22.762 --> 04:26.095
Look, will you please get a handle
on your hormones and find out?

04:26.165 --> 04:28.099
I'm very nervous here.
You're nervous?

04:28.167 --> 04:30.101
Yes. You're the luckiest
guy on the planet.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.933
Are we anywhere near
the date of Marilyn's suicide?

04:33.006 --> 04:35.270
Oh.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.935
Geez, you're right. We're close
to it. That's what I thought.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.206
Don't you think you should go
back and give Gooshie a hand?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.748
You think you're here to keep her
alive, maybe? Just go, all right?

04:42.815 --> 04:44.749
Okay.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.877
Uh, I'm gonna do a lot of observing
on this leap.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.992
Of course, they still
haven't signed a leading man.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.899
Naturally my agent asked
for casting approval.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.403
<i>Hello, Miss Monroe.</i>

05:05.471 --> 05:09.134
Who are you?
Please get out of my house.

05:09.208 --> 05:11.176
We had an appointment...

05:11.244 --> 05:15.203
for an hour ago.

05:15.281 --> 05:19.911
We did?
I'm Barbara... Whitmore.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.582
You did tell your agent you needed
a secretary, a gofer, an assistant.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.924
Actually, George told me
I should hire someone.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.625
Tired of my being late
for everything, I guess.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.366
I know I should have waited outside, but the
gardener saw me waiting for a half an hour...

05:39.439 --> 05:41.373
and he let me in.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.534
Really, I'm very embarrassed.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.539
I'm sorry, honey,
but I'm not hiring today.

05:48.614 --> 05:52.550
<i>Sure you are. I mean,
you know, you should be.</i>

05:52.618 --> 05:57.282
It's amazing to me that somebody as busy
and as important as you...

05:57.357 --> 06:01.384
doesn't have someone
looking out for her appointments,

06:01.461 --> 06:05.261
keeping her affairs in order,
providing companionship.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.126
It's not good to be alone.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.227
I get by okay.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.238
Well, sure, "get by. "
But I mean-

06:13.306 --> 06:15.900
I'm sure Miss Monroe doesn't lack
for companionship.

06:15.975 --> 06:19.411
But I can promise that I would be
very efficient, Miss Monroe,

06:19.479 --> 06:21.743
and you'll never even know
that I'm here.

06:21.814 --> 06:25.079
Besides, it would give you a chance
to concentrate...

06:25.151 --> 06:27.085
<i>on the things that make you happy-</i>

06:27.153 --> 06:29.815
<i>the new script, picking that leading man.</i>

06:29.889 --> 06:32.653
It would be so much more
than just a job to me, Miss Monroe.

06:32.725 --> 06:37.219
<i>What I mean is, I have admired you
for as long as I can remember-</i>

06:37.296 --> 06:40.322
<i>your art, your performances.</i>

06:41.401 --> 06:43.926
Most of my performances
aren't worth remembering.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.437
Oh, no.
No, they're all worth remembering.

06:46.506 --> 06:50.340
<i>I even rented one of your old apartments.
You know, the Voltaire on Crescent Heights?</i>

06:50.410 --> 06:52.344
I can't really afford it,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.846
but I figured it was as close
as I'd ever get to meeting you.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.818
Now here I am.
I'm- I'm talking to you in the flesh.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.185
At least I can say I met you.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.025
<i>Barbara?</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:19.936
I'll pay you 75 a week, 50 with
room and board if you'll live here.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.874
Here? With-With you?

07:23.943 --> 07:27.276
There are more bedrooms
than even I can use.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.849
Oh, you won't be sorry,
Miss Monroe.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.295
Where do you want this stuff?

07:44.363 --> 07:46.524
Oh. Uh, right there.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.533
Okay.
Thanks.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.865
Uh, where's the rest?

07:50.937 --> 07:53.701
That's it.
What do you mean, "That's it"?

07:53.773 --> 07:56.708
Two suitcases and a cardboard box
is your whole life?

07:56.776 --> 07:59.301
My whole life is Marilyn.

07:59.378 --> 08:02.074
Doesn't sound too fulfilling.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.139
Are you kidding?

08:04.217 --> 08:06.378
I've seen every film she's ever made,

08:06.452 --> 08:08.579
<i>from Dangerous Years
to Let's Make Love-</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:11.521
most of them two or three times.

08:11.591 --> 08:15.152
<i>What's your favorite?
Uh, Some Like It Hot.</i>

08:15.228 --> 08:17.355
<i>Oh. I like Bus Stop.</i>

08:19.632 --> 08:22.726
Well, look, I'll
- I'll get out of your hair here. Okay? Let you unpack.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.896
I can't believe I'm actually here,
in her house.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.906
Me either.
Oh, my God.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.374
Marilyn is the whole reason
I left Tyrone.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.604
Your boyfriend?

08:32.678 --> 08:34.942
No. My hometown.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.244
Tyrone, Ohio.
Oh. Sorry.

08:37.316 --> 08:41.013
Was your family upset,
you moving so far away?

08:41.087 --> 08:43.681
Yeah. See,

08:43.756 --> 08:46.623
I got married when I was 17 years old,

08:46.692 --> 08:50.458
and Bobby joined the air force,
and he was sent over to Germany.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.692
One morning a telegram came.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.428
He was killed in a training exercise.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.265
I'm sorry.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.533
Mama and Daddy-
They held this wake.

09:02.608 --> 09:05.543
Everybody in town
was feeling sorry for me.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.205
L- I couldn't stand it.

09:08.281 --> 09:12.047
<i>The Prince and the Showgirl was playing
at the Palace walk-in on Main Street,</i>

09:12.118 --> 09:15.918
so I snuck out of the house, I paid
my 65 cents and I sat in the dark.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.225
I stayed through four shows.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.386
Changed the course
of my whole life.

09:24.463 --> 09:30.333
Uh
- come on. I mean, you can't base your whole life on an image on the screen.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.305
Why not?
Because it isn't real.

09:35.975 --> 09:38.739
Marilyn is better than real.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.279
She's the most amazing woman
in the whole world.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.684
Is it true?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.583
What?
What they say-

09:48.654 --> 09:53.284
You know, about her being involved with
a certain senator from Massachusetts?

09:54.660 --> 09:57.527
Oh, right. Well, uh-
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.588
I'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.156
I wouldn't want you
to betray her trust.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.702
Look, I admire Marilyn a lot,

10:04.770 --> 10:07.261
but I think you could us
a little, uh,

10:07.340 --> 10:09.774
more perspective.

10:09.842 --> 10:13.710
Oh, come on.
Haven't you ever had an idol?

10:13.779 --> 10:17.613
Me? Uh, well, sure.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.844
Who?
"Who?"

10:19.919 --> 10:23.685
- Who?
- Albert Einstein.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.781
What?

10:25.858 --> 10:27.792
L-
What?

10:27.860 --> 10:31.057
I would just say that I'm a lot closer
to my idol than you are to yours.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.223
<i>Oh, but Albert Einstein is-</i>

10:34.300 --> 10:36.234
Sam, we gotta talk.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.907
Uh, why don't you call me
if you need anything else, okay?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.908
Okay.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.001
See you later.
All right.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.250
What's wrong? What's wrong
is that you were right.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.658
There's only four days
until Marilyn's suicide.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.030
And I'm here to stop it?

11:06.098 --> 11:08.760
Well, there was so much mystery
surrounding Marilyn's death...

11:08.834 --> 11:11.166
that Ziggy's afraid
to make a guess.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.467
But what else could it be?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.669
We're talking about some pretty...

11:17.743 --> 11:20.075
major history changing here, Al.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.444
Hey, we're in
the wrong-righting business,

11:22.515 --> 11:25.609
and Marilyn's death was one of the
big-time wrongs in our lifetime,

11:25.685 --> 11:30.088
and there was a lot of us that never
bought it as a suicide in the first place.

11:30.156 --> 11:34.115
All right, look. I want you to get
Ziggy, and get me an answer right now.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.219
Am I here to stop Marilyn's death?
Yes or no.

11:39.298 --> 11:41.994
92.4% sure.

11:51.977 --> 11:55.378
<i>For the next few days
I was Marilyn's shadow,</i>

11:55.448 --> 11:57.746
<i>and my strategy
seemed to be paying off.</i>

11:57.817 --> 12:00.581
<i>Barbara turned out to be
a great companion,</i>

12:00.653 --> 12:02.917
<i>and Marilyn ate up
the constant flattery.</i>

12:04.490 --> 12:06.754
<i>But Marilyn was also a night owl.</i>

12:06.826 --> 12:09.260
<i>Her appetite for high living
and champagne...</i>

12:09.328 --> 12:13.424
<i>was matched only by her stamina
for partying hard and long-</i>

12:13.499 --> 12:17.094
<i>and I wasn't sure how much more
of it I could take.</i>

12:17.169 --> 12:19.660
<i>But I didn't dare leave her alone.</i>

12:38.190 --> 12:40.385
<i>Sam.!</i>

12:40.459 --> 12:42.893
<i>Al, why do you always do that to me?
Oh, God, you gotta come quick.</i>

12:42.962 --> 12:45.055
What? What is it? You gotta
come. It's Marilyn Monroe.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.032
Where? At the pool. Oh, I
hope you're not too late.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.034
A-

12:52.004 --> 12:54.632
<i>Sam, hurry, hurry, hurry.!</i>

12:54.707 --> 12:57.198
Sam, look at that.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.278
Well, good morning.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.678
Is something wrong?
Uh-

13:02.748 --> 13:05.342
<i>You brought me out here
for this? Are you kiddin'?</i>

13:05.417 --> 13:08.909
<i>It's like looking at Helen ofTroy
or Botticelli's Venus. Naked.</i>

13:08.988 --> 13:10.979
Right.
Wrong.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.457
It's okay. You can look now.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.688
I didn't mean to offend you.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.253
Oh, no, you didn't offend me.

13:19.331 --> 13:23.131
L- I was just, uh, leaving anyway.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.797
I had to go to the, uh, garage,
to see if there was any...

13:26.872 --> 13:29.568
you know, gas in the car.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.304
The garage is that way.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.838
But I needed to get a little
exercise. That's why I was running.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.749
Well, then, come on in.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.379
Yes!
No.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.388
<i>No, thank you.</i>

13:44.456 --> 13:47.721
I never thought I'd see the day
a man turns me down for a skinny-dip.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.727
I must be losing it.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.730
No, you're not. No.

13:52.798 --> 13:54.766
<i>You're not losing it. You-</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:56.768
<i>You got lots of it.
Lots.</i>

13:56.836 --> 13:59.031
<i>- Lots and lots of it.
- Lots and lots and lots.</i>

13:59.104 --> 14:01.732
Y- You're terrific.

14:01.807 --> 14:04.970
How you feeling
today anyway? Who, me?

14:05.044 --> 14:07.342
<i>- Yeah.
- Just wonderful.</i>

14:07.413 --> 14:09.404
<i>It's a beautiful day, a new house,</i>

14:09.481 --> 14:12.006
champagne-

14:12.084 --> 14:14.018
- Who needs a life?
- You do.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.384
<i>I mean-
I'll get it.</i>

14:20.693 --> 14:24.185
Oh, double your pleasure,
double your fun.

14:24.263 --> 14:27.755
Our choirboy is too bashful to swim au naturel.

14:27.833 --> 14:31.132
How sweet.
True, but not much fun.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.637
Do you really think you should be
drinking champagne before breakfast?

14:33.706 --> 14:38.006
<i>This is breakfast.
You did a good job on your makeup.</i>

14:38.077 --> 14:40.307
<i>- A little bit too much eyeliner though.
- Can you help me?</i>

14:40.379 --> 14:42.779
Sure.
Great.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.484
Al!

14:47.953 --> 14:50.148
Thanks.
Uh-huh.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.586
- Oh, Dennis? Have the car ready in an hour.
- Okay.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.655
<i>I think I'll be in the
mood for a ride. Okay.</i>

15:05.137 --> 15:07.367
I hate towels.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.409
<i>What made you decide
to study acting?</i>

15:12.478 --> 15:15.743
Watching my own movies.

15:15.814 --> 15:17.748
I love this place.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.580
<i>I must have seen Rebel Without
a Cause at least five times.</i>

15:20.653 --> 15:23.747
That's right. This is it.

15:23.822 --> 15:26.620
<i>That's- That was
here. Rebel Without-</i>

15:26.692 --> 15:28.626
The Hollywood sign.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.925
That was a great movie, with the hot
rods and-and the chicken thing at the end.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.931
Mm-hmm.
Man.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.594
PoorJames Dean. Sometimes I think I'll go like him
- young and fast.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.604
Don't say that.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.538
I'm kind of surprised you're
getting away with this. With what?

15:44.610 --> 15:47.511
With being out in the public, you know,
without being spotted.

15:47.579 --> 15:50.878
Only Marilyn Monroe
gets spotted.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.714
Today I'm Norma Jean Baker.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.984
Come on, boys.
Here we go.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.222
They look like little angels.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.232
I always wanted a family.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.632
You too, right?
Who me?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.637
No way.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.902
But you did when you were married.
You-

16:15.975 --> 16:18.239
I mean, I know you had
a tough childhood,

16:18.310 --> 16:21.746
and sometimes that makes people want
to do better by their own children.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.079
I bounced around foster homes
like a Ping-Pong ball.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.744
Think I want to put some
poor kid through that?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.914
What makes you think you would?
You'd be a great mother.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.924
Right.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.094
Marilyn-

16:37.162 --> 16:39.153
Marilyn, look, I know
that for every good thing...

16:39.231 --> 16:41.529
that this life has given you,
it's also given you-

16:41.600 --> 16:44.865
A punch in the nose?
A thorn for every rose?

16:44.937 --> 16:46.871
Something like that, yeah.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.874
Those are clichés, Dennis.
They don't play.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.308
Look, I'm not trying
to be a writer.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.871
I'm just-
I'm just trying to tell you that...

16:57.950 --> 17:01.716
your life can be so wonderful,
if you let it.

17:01.787 --> 17:05.223
You've gotta hang on to it
with everything you've got.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.886
What's gotten into you?
People adore you.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.728
"Adore. " That's great if you're
some kind of a stone statue.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.563
No, no, look.
That's not what I meant.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.229
People really care about you.

17:19.304 --> 17:23.400
You're one of the most loved people
in the world...

17:23.474 --> 17:25.500
ever.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.771
Then why can't I feel it?

17:29.481 --> 17:31.574
I don't know.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.576
Just promise me
you won't stop trying.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.723
Give me a few minutes
alone, okay?

17:59.445 --> 18:01.379
<i>How's she doing?</i>

18:01.447 --> 18:03.938
<i>I don't know if I'm reaching her.
You better keep a close eye on her.</i>

18:04.016 --> 18:06.211
You know, her cause of death
was listed as-

18:06.285 --> 18:08.549
I know. Barbiturate overdose.
You've only told me five times.

18:08.620 --> 18:13.216
And you don't have to remind me what
happens when you mix downers and champagne.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.522
Well, it's bad.
Al?

18:15.594 --> 18:19.860
<i>Would you think I was crazy if I told you that
- If you told me what?</i>

18:22.968 --> 18:25.061
Never mind.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.901
I'd say welcome
to the human race, Sam.

18:27.973 --> 18:30.168
Every man that ever met her
fell in love with her.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.769
Just take good care of her
and don't let her die.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.011
<i>Nobody that beautiful
should ever die.</i>

19:00.606 --> 19:03.700
I wore this for you, Mr. Senator.

19:03.775 --> 19:06.175
Look what I didn't wear.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.916
<i>Barbara? Barbara?</i>

19:15.120 --> 19:17.281
Be a dear and pour me
a drink, hmm?

19:17.356 --> 19:19.881
How about if I fix you
a snack instead?

19:19.958 --> 19:23.018
A sandwich maybe?
Party pooper.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.029
<i>Marilyn-</i>

19:25.097 --> 19:27.565
<i>Come on. L-
I just feel like, you know-</i>

19:27.633 --> 19:29.726
Oh, come on. Leave the
champagne alone. Barbara?

19:29.801 --> 19:32.065
<i>Honey, no.
Right here.</i>

19:32.137 --> 19:34.071
<i>Be a love and get Peter Lawford
on the phone, will you?</i>

19:34.139 --> 19:37.575
<i>Oh, he called while you were out
about his party this afternoon.</i>

19:37.643 --> 19:40.578
What party? Peter's throwing
one of his famous beach bashes.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.740
- Uh-oh. - Yeah, but weren't you
just saying that you were tired?

19:43.815 --> 19:46.340
That's right,
so I'm calling to cancel.

19:46.418 --> 19:49.512
- Oh, great.
- You can't cancel now.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.583
I mean, he was so counting
on you to be there.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.595
Peter will be drunk by sundown.
He won't even miss me.

19:59.498 --> 20:02.934
Well, he sort of hinted that maybe
there would be some guests there...

20:03.001 --> 20:04.935
that you wouldn't want to miss.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.733
Think he meant from out of town.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.070
<i>From back East?</i>

20:10.142 --> 20:12.269
From Washington, D.C.?

20:12.344 --> 20:15.609
Would that be who I think it is?

20:15.681 --> 20:19.481
- Did he say what time?
- He said whatever time you could make it.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.985
<i>He's kind of a flirt,
isn't he?</i>

20:22.054 --> 20:25.785
Oh, Peter? Shameless.
Why? Did he get fresh with you?

20:25.857 --> 20:28.121
<i>Oh, no, no.
He was perfectly polite.</i>

20:28.193 --> 20:30.957
Just playful. He actually asked
if maybe I could go along with you,

20:31.029 --> 20:33.623
but I told him I couldn't
possibly do that.

20:33.699 --> 20:37.294
- Why not? Do you have plans?
- No, I just wouldn't dream of-

20:37.369 --> 20:39.496
I- I wouldn't want to horn in.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.131
Who's horning in?

20:42.207 --> 20:47.008
I can't. I don't have anything to
wear. No dress, no bathing suit.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.071
I only have a hundred.
I think I can loan you one.

20:52.985 --> 20:57.718
Sam, this is not good. Lawford's parties were legendary
- sex, booze, drugs.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.781
What are you gonna do? I don't
know. Tell you what though.

21:00.859 --> 21:04.920
I want you to have Ziggy check on
Barbara Whitmore from Tyrone, Ohio, okay?

21:14.840 --> 21:18.332
<i>Is that little doggie of yours still
messing up the living room carpet?</i>

21:18.410 --> 21:20.605
As a matter of fact, she is.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.113
Read the new script yet?
Half of it.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.149
Uh, she liked it.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.276
I mean, you did like it,
didn't you?

21:27.352 --> 21:29.946
Take it, darling,
and offer me the lead.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.924
I think you should take it. I mean,
I think you should take the picture.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.521
Well, no offense.
I'm sorry, I mean-

21:37.596 --> 21:40.497
I didn't mean that-
I mean, I didn't-

21:40.565 --> 21:42.726
I meant-
Oh, God.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.860
She should give you
the part if she wants to.

21:44.936 --> 21:48.736
I didn't say that. I'm just saying
- Look, why don't you quit while you're behind?

21:48.807 --> 21:52.402
Don't mind Dennis. As a critic,
he's a wonderful chauffeur.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.071
I'm just saying that I think
she should take the movie.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.741
The public is crying
for a new Marilyn Monroe movie.

21:57.816 --> 22:01.252
After my last picture,
they're just plain crying.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.584
Don't say that, darling.
They love you.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.093
Uh-

22:10.829 --> 22:13.059
I'll wait downstairs.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.245
So, why haven't I seen you
here before? I'm new in town.

22:32.317 --> 22:34.911
But didn't I see you come in
with Marilyn Monroe?

22:34.986 --> 22:36.920
Yes. We're friends.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.922
Good afternoon.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.220
Gentlemen, how are you?
Nice to see you.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.557
Isn't thatJohn Huston?
In the flesh.

22:43.628 --> 22:45.892
One of the all-time greats.

22:45.964 --> 22:48.398
Oh, he's someone
I would really like to meet.

22:48.467 --> 22:51.231
That's no problem at all. Yes,
I'm starting a film tomorrow.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.396
I'd like to do that
very much.

22:53.472 --> 22:55.406
Mr. Huston, this is Barbara.
Hello.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.066
She's with Marilyn.
How do you do?

22:57.142 --> 22:58.837
Mr. Huston, it is such
a pleasure to meet you.

22:58.910 --> 23:02.402
I just think your work is
so wonderful. Thank you.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.779
<i>I've seen all your movies
at least two or three times.</i>

23:04.850 --> 23:07.444
How come you're not with Marilyn?
I'm just the hired help, remember?

23:07.519 --> 23:10.977
Yeah, you see the other hired help? She's
over there acting like the guest of honor.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.321
Sid, this is Barbara Whitmore.
She wants to be an actress.

23:16.161 --> 23:20.029
What did you come up with? Uh,
not much. We've got problems.

23:20.098 --> 23:23.261
You sure she said Tyrone, Ohio?
There's no Tyrone, Ohio.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.099
There's a Tyrone, Kansas.
Oh, well, try that then.

23:26.171 --> 23:31.268
I did. Came up with a Wentworth and a Wendling,
but no Whitmore. Maybe it's her married name.

23:31.343 --> 23:35.279
She said she was married to a
flyer who died overseas in training.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.976
That's still gonna be tough, because
Defense is very stingy with their info.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.450
Do we have a doctor here?
Anyone.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.483
- It's Marilyn, isn't it.
- Don't bother me now. I need a doctor.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.491
<i>I am a doctor.</i>

23:54.866 --> 23:57.767
<i>What's wrong?</i>

23:57.836 --> 23:59.827
Is she all right?
Is she gonna be all right?

23:59.905 --> 24:03.500
Oh, my God, Al.
There's no pulse.

24:14.519 --> 24:17.147
<i>What are you doing? Good
God, man, you're crushing her.</i>

24:22.093 --> 24:24.288
Now stop that.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.296
I know what I'm doing.

24:26.364 --> 24:29.527
You're her bloody driver.
I'm trying to save her life.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.837
For God's sake.

24:33.905 --> 24:36.271
<i>My brother-in-law's on his
way. He's running for president.</i>

24:36.341 --> 24:38.809
<i>If she dies-</i>

24:38.877 --> 24:41.072
Sam, I think she's comin' around.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.910
Okay, easy.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.576
Thank God.
Look, just breathe.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.642
<i>What did you give her?</i>

24:48.720 --> 24:50.654
Give her?

24:50.722 --> 24:54.214
Damn it, man, what did you give her?
She begged me for a couple of Nembutals.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.522
L
- I only gave her one. There's more in the medicine cabinet.

24:56.595 --> 25:00.224
<i>- She may have found them.
- Dr. Pullbrook's on his way.</i>

25:00.298 --> 25:02.232
Don't just stand there.
Go down and start a cold bath, okay?

25:02.300 --> 25:05.565
Then get some coffee and mix up the vilest
mess of things you can find in the kitchen-

25:05.637 --> 25:07.571
vinegar and molasses,
anything, all right?

25:07.639 --> 25:09.573
But why? To induce
vomiting. Now go!

25:09.641 --> 25:12.235
We've gotta keep her conscious
until the doctor gets here.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.744
That's it. Come on. Come on.
That-a-girl.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.077
Easy, easy. Okay.
Just take- That-a-girl.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.082
That-a-baby.
That-a-baby. Okay.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.141
Easy. Okay.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.154
<i>The doctor finally arrived...</i>

25:24.222 --> 25:26.452
<i>and told us Marilyn
was gonna be okay,</i>

25:26.525 --> 25:30.086
<i>but he left us with strict orders
to make sure she stayed sober...</i>

25:30.161 --> 25:32.356
<i>and got plenty of rest.</i>

25:32.430 --> 25:35.263
<i>I'd saved her life,
but I still hadn't leaped,</i>

25:35.333 --> 25:39.030
<i>so now I didn't have a clue
as to what I was supposed to do.</i>

25:39.104 --> 25:42.073
<i>Good morning.</i>

25:44.442 --> 25:47.002
What's cooking?
Scrambled eggs.

25:49.381 --> 25:53.715
You like 'em? It smells
absolutely... revolting.

25:53.785 --> 25:56.276
Come on, come on.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.288
Doctor's orders.

25:58.356 --> 26:00.347
<i>Dr. Dennis?</i>

26:00.425 --> 26:03.121
That's me. Dr. Dennis.
Hmm.

26:03.194 --> 26:05.560
Madam.
Mmm. Thank you.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.724
May I?

26:08.800 --> 26:12.201
Mm-mmm. Oh, come on. Come on.
You're gonna hurt my feelings.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.269
Pretty great, right?

26:19.344 --> 26:21.505
Oh, it's not that bad.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.454
You saved my life.

26:32.824 --> 26:36.123
I just kept you up and walking around
till the doctor got there, that's all.

26:36.194 --> 26:39.357
No. No, no, no, no.
No.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.423
I read somewhere,
in Africa- or Asia-

26:43.935 --> 26:48.998
that when someone saves your life, they're
responsible for you for as long as you live.

26:49.074 --> 26:52.942
Yeah, but this is California.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.446
<i>That's where it was.</i>

27:16.434 --> 27:18.368
Wow.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.405
Wow.

27:22.774 --> 27:25.004
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.044
Marilyn, we can't do this.

27:27.112 --> 27:30.912
Yes, you can. No.
Please. Listen to me.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.883
It's not that I don't want to.

27:33.952 --> 27:37.285
I mean, every man
on the planet wants you.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.346
They don't want me.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.688
They want Marilyn.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.853
But I'm not her.

27:43.928 --> 27:48.388
She's somebody that I put on, like
a cashmere sweater or a mink coat.

27:48.466 --> 27:52.300
Somehow I think you're
the first man I've ever met...

27:52.370 --> 27:54.895
that really understands that.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.706
I'm sure there were others too. I just
- Maybe you weren't listening.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.305
I listened.

28:06.751 --> 28:09.083
Men didn't.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.393
Marilyn,

28:17.796 --> 28:19.821
I am very,

28:19.898 --> 28:21.889
very flattered...

28:21.966 --> 28:24.730
that you feel this way,

28:24.803 --> 28:26.862
and, uh,

28:26.938 --> 28:29.771
I care about you a great deal.

28:30.842 --> 28:34.107
<i>I mean, you are the most
incredibly attractive woman that-</i>

28:37.148 --> 28:39.582
But I can't let myself
get involved with you.

28:39.651 --> 28:42.984
- It wouldn't be fair to either one of us.
- Why not?

28:43.054 --> 28:46.717
If I told you that,
you'd think I was crazy.

28:46.791 --> 28:49.282
- Try me.
- Look.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.156
A lot of people have let you down-

28:54.232 --> 28:56.632
<i>too many people-</i>

28:56.701 --> 28:58.635
and as much as I'd like to,

28:58.703 --> 29:02.298
I can't promise you
that I'd always be there for you.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.908
Marilyn. Don't-

29:17.288 --> 29:19.256
You're a stronger man than I am.

29:37.475 --> 29:40.569
Going somewhere?
Out for a walk.

29:40.645 --> 29:43.478
Thought you might like
some orange juice.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.951
This is a mimosa.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.112
It's very, very weak.
I'm sorry.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.884
My dad always said it was
the easiest way to taper off.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.289
I'll go fix it plain, if you like.
Mmm.

29:56.661 --> 30:01.530
You know, I'd never even tried
champagne until I met you.

30:01.599 --> 30:03.533
If you say so.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.901
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done for me.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.907
It's nothing.

30:10.975 --> 30:15.275
You've been my friend. You have
introduced me to the most wonderful people.

30:15.346 --> 30:19.442
I just can't wait till you feel better so
we can take Mr. Lawford up on his invitation.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.849
What invitation?

30:21.920 --> 30:23.854
Dennis didn't tell you?

30:23.922 --> 30:27.289
Peter invited us up to the
CalNeva for as long as you like.

30:27.358 --> 30:30.122
Dennis didn't tell me anything.

30:30.195 --> 30:33.130
Oh. Well, he's worried
about you.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.428
Anyway, Frank Sinatra
is going to be singing,

30:35.500 --> 30:38.560
<i>and apparently he wanted you especially
- Stop it, Barbara.</i>

30:38.636 --> 30:41.366
What do you think you're doing?

30:42.440 --> 30:46.672
We're discussing Peter's invitation to me.
Do you have a problem with that? Yes, I do.

30:46.744 --> 30:49.235
I don't think that a jet-set casino is
any place for someone in your condition.

30:49.314 --> 30:52.078
Well, I don't pay you
to make those decisions.

30:52.150 --> 30:55.119
No, you don't, but you pay your
doctor to, and he agrees with me.

30:55.186 --> 30:59.418
Besides, you're supposed to start rehearsal
for your new movie tomorrow, right?

30:59.490 --> 31:03.256
Nursemaid, cop, driver-
Is there anything you don't do?

31:03.328 --> 31:05.922
I'm responsible for you, remember?

31:05.997 --> 31:09.763
Africa, Asia, California?

31:09.834 --> 31:12.962
As I recall, that was one job
you didn't want.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.198
Don't be too hard on him, Marilyn.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.607
He means well.
Everyone means well.

31:19.677 --> 31:22.145
- Not everyone.
- What do you mean?

31:22.213 --> 31:24.272
Ask her.

31:25.516 --> 31:28.280
I don't know what he means.
The hell you don't.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.787
Tell her.

31:30.855 --> 31:33.415
Tell her that your real name
is MaryJo Vermullen.

31:33.491 --> 31:36.483
<i>You're not from Tyrone, Ohio.
You're from Pasadena, California.</i>

31:36.561 --> 31:38.927
And you've been in the Actors Guild
since you were 12 years old.

31:38.997 --> 31:42.455
Dennis, why are you saying these things?
Because Marilyn deserves to hear the truth.

31:42.533 --> 31:46.765
- You've been lying to her. I want to know why.
- You're being ridiculous. This girl is no actress.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.306
No? She conned you
into going to Lawford's party.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.137
She didn't con me.
Sure, she did.

31:51.209 --> 31:55.236
So that she could go too. So that she
could meet John Huston or somebody like him.

31:55.313 --> 31:58.339
"I don't have anything to wear. I don't want to
horn in. " Dennis, that's enough! That's enough!

31:58.416 --> 32:01.510
Ask her about her late husband,
the flyer who crashed over Germany.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.520
The one who doesn't exist.
What was his name?

32:03.588 --> 32:05.920
Dennis, I've never been married.

32:06.991 --> 32:09.585
She told me this whole story...

32:09.661 --> 32:13.097
about being married
and being widowed young,

32:13.164 --> 32:15.291
<i>and her parents didn't understand.</i>

32:15.366 --> 32:18.824
She told you too, right?
This is the first I've heard of it.

32:18.903 --> 32:22.168
- You're not the only one.
- Don't you see? She's trying to use you.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.641
She's never asked me for anything.
There's no such place as Tyrone, Ohio.

32:25.710 --> 32:28.110
- She made the whole thing up.
- Get out, Dennis.

32:28.179 --> 32:32.013
- What?
- You heard me. You're fired.

32:34.185 --> 32:36.517
Marilyn, just listen to me. If you
don't want me, that's one thing,

32:36.587 --> 32:39.488
but you're not gonna tell me where
to go, who to see, what to do,

32:39.557 --> 32:41.889
and you are not going to hurt
this sweet kid.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.691
Now be out by the morning
or I'm calling the police.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.739
<i>Good morning, Sam.</i>

32:55.807 --> 32:58.435
I got fired.
You got fired?

32:58.509 --> 33:02.411
That's right. When I left, Marilyn
was practically proposing to you.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.414
What ha-

33:04.482 --> 33:07.974
Oh, a woman scorned? There
was more to it than that, Al.

33:08.052 --> 33:10.577
Barbara set me up.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.089
After I brought her in
- I mean, how stupid could I have been?

33:13.157 --> 33:15.091
I thought she'd help Marilyn.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.787
No, the only one that Barbara
would help is herself.

33:17.862 --> 33:20.126
Did you tell Marilyn what we
learned about her? Sure. Sure, I did.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.598
I told her everything,
but she didn't buy it.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.103
I tried to talk to her all night long,
but she locked herself in her bedroom.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.764
I know she was in there
getting plastered again.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.673
And I'll bet Barbara
was doing the pouring.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.570
What am I gonna do?

33:35.646 --> 33:40.083
Come on, Ziggy.

33:40.151 --> 33:42.176
What's wrong with Ziggy?
She's just acting temperamental.

33:42.253 --> 33:46.713
She says the Hollywood types
are too unpredictable to predict.

33:46.791 --> 33:50.454
The farthest she'll go is to say that it's
something to do with Marilyn's new movie.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.895
And she can't be any more specific
than that? No. It's not clear.

33:53.965 --> 33:56.957
You see, in the original history,
Marilyn finished the movie,

33:57.035 --> 34:00.198
but now there's a 78.3% chance
that she doesn't finish the film.

34:00.271 --> 34:02.762
I dunno.
It's gotta be Barbara.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.435
Right? I mean, she's the one variable
that I brought into this thing.

34:06.511 --> 34:10.607
Is Marilyn ready to work? Well, she
better be. She's got a rehearsal today.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.478
Look. I'm gonna go get her
on her feet.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.610
You go find Barbara.
Okay.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.967
It's 10 after.
I'm sure she'll be here any second.

34:30.034 --> 34:32.764
You don't know Marilyn.

34:32.837 --> 34:35.931
They should have given her
her own time zone.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.032
John, I called her house.

34:38.109 --> 34:40.873
Got no answer,
so she must be on her way.

34:40.945 --> 34:44.039
Not necessarily.

34:44.114 --> 34:46.549
Look, Junior, I'm not your problem.

34:46.617 --> 34:50.313
I know Marilyn well enough
to be patient.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.821
Uh, he's a different story.

34:53.891 --> 34:56.382
<i>Excuse me.</i>

34:56.460 --> 34:58.520
This is a closed rehearsal.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.224
Oh, I know.
That's why I'm here.

35:01.299 --> 35:05.167
Hi. I'm Barbara Whitmore.
Marilyn Monroe's assistant.

35:05.236 --> 35:06.999
We met at Peter Lawford's.

35:07.071 --> 35:11.599
<i>I told you how much I admired the performance
you got out of Marilyn in The AsphaltJungle.</i>

35:11.676 --> 35:15.134
Well, the woman does have
some talent of her own.

35:15.213 --> 35:18.341
I know, but not every director
can find it.

35:18.416 --> 35:21.874
- Where is Marilyn?
- She's...

35:21.953 --> 35:23.887
indisposed today.

35:23.955 --> 35:27.049
<i>"Indisposed"?
It's not serious,</i>

35:27.125 --> 35:29.184
but she didn't want
to hold things up either.

35:29.260 --> 35:33.492
That's why she sent me. She and I have
been working on the script together.

35:33.564 --> 35:36.965
We've been rehearsing scenes, and I've
been taking down her notes for the rewrite.

35:37.034 --> 35:41.562
- Why, you lyin' little- - Marilyn says I
know the material backwards and forwards.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.664
She said I should
stand in for her today.

35:44.942 --> 35:48.343
<i>We don't need a stand-in.
We need our star.</i>

35:49.947 --> 35:53.348
Look, I know I'm not
Miss Monroe, but-

35:55.786 --> 36:01.224
Actually, Junior, I would
like to hear the words aloud.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.692
You got any opinion on this, Clark?

36:09.133 --> 36:11.693
Beats waiting for the princess.

36:11.769 --> 36:13.862
<i>Marilyn.</i>

36:13.938 --> 36:16.736
Marilyn, come on. Wake up.
You gotta go to rehearsal.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.071
Leave me alone. Come on. You
gotta get up and go to rehearsal.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.236
I fired you yesterday.
It's none of your business.

36:21.312 --> 36:24.907
You are my business,
and you are going to rehearsal.

36:24.982 --> 36:26.745
Now come on.

36:26.817 --> 36:29.285
Come on. Wake up.

36:32.156 --> 36:35.387
How come you're not
turning your back this time, choirboy?

36:35.459 --> 36:37.757
Because we've got work to do.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.766
Now let's go. Come on.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.860
Come on. That's it.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.372
Let's go.
Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.840
No, you're not. Come on.

36:51.909 --> 36:53.843
Come on.

36:53.911 --> 36:56.038
<i>Hey, turn that shower off. It's cold.</i>

36:56.113 --> 36:58.946
<i>Maybe the problem is
you'rejust not used to it yet.</i>

36:59.016 --> 37:03.612
No, the trouble is, I always end up
right back where I started.

37:03.688 --> 37:06.054
<i>No one ever cared
about me.</i>

37:06.123 --> 37:09.456
What about your mother?
You had her, right?

37:10.962 --> 37:13.897
How do you have someone
who isn't even there?

37:13.965 --> 37:16.399
She'd go off with some man
for months at a time.

37:16.467 --> 37:19.129
<i>You know how long
a month is to a kid?</i>

37:19.203 --> 37:21.763
<i>This is hot.!
All right, all right, all right.</i>

37:21.839 --> 37:24.967
Just-Just put it down-
For a second.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.976
Just let it cool down
for a minute.

37:27.044 --> 37:29.911
All right. Let's try again. Okay?

37:29.981 --> 37:33.815
"Maybe the problem is
that you're just not used to it yet. "

37:36.320 --> 37:38.584
Come on, Marilyn. It's your
line. Oh, leave me alone.

37:38.656 --> 37:41.022
Come on. Just try.
Please? Leave me alone.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.687
Marilyn, listen to me.
Now come on.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.698
The lights are on. The
camera's rolling. You're on.

37:48.766 --> 37:52.202
Now, maybe the problem is
- The problem is that I am still stoned,

37:52.270 --> 37:55.000
and I'm sick,
and I can rehearse tomorrow.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.409
Sam, you were right.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.207
That little hussy's down at the
studio right now with Huston and Gable,

38:02.280 --> 38:05.511
and she's reading Marilyn's lines.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.881
The problem is
there may not be a tomorrow,

38:07.952 --> 38:10.853
because right now there's
a young, beautiful girl...

38:10.921 --> 38:13.890
named Barbara Whitmore
with Gable and with Huston,

38:13.958 --> 38:16.552
and she's reading your lines,
she's standing in your shoes,

38:16.627 --> 38:21.121
doing everything she can to convince them
that you're an unreliable, undependable drunk.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.723
How do you know where she is?

38:23.801 --> 38:26.235
Trust me. I just do.
Now come on.

38:26.304 --> 38:31.105
Just like you knew all those
other horrible things about her?

38:32.109 --> 38:35.567
Everything I told you about her
was the truth.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.080
And here's more.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.243
I don't know why, but...

38:42.853 --> 38:45.413
you've gotta make this picture.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.822
<i>There'll be other pictures.</i>

38:52.063 --> 38:54.896
I don't know
about the other pictures,

38:54.965 --> 38:57.195
but this one will never come again,

38:57.268 --> 39:01.568
and this one needs you.

39:01.639 --> 39:07.578
It's needs a brash, beautiful,
glorious, untamable misfit.

39:07.645 --> 39:10.546
"Misfit"?

39:11.615 --> 39:13.606
Come on.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.291
"The problem is...

39:21.359 --> 39:23.350
you're just not used to it yet. "

39:23.427 --> 39:28.888
No, the problem is I always end up
back where I started.

39:28.966 --> 39:32.424
No one ever really cared about me.

39:32.503 --> 39:35.870
<i>You mean, you don't have a plane to catch
or school to teach or something?</i>

39:35.940 --> 39:38.272
Me, a teacher?

39:38.342 --> 39:41.072
I didn't even get
through the eighth grade.

39:41.145 --> 39:44.706
That's real good news.

39:44.782 --> 39:46.716
Why?

39:46.784 --> 39:49.753
Smart women
ask too many questions.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.755
Always trying to figure a man out.

39:52.823 --> 39:56.418
Maybe they just want
to know you better.

39:56.494 --> 40:00.590
Well, there's only one way to
get to know a man better, honey.

40:00.664 --> 40:02.928
You mean you'd lie?

40:04.502 --> 40:06.595
Maybe not.

40:06.670 --> 40:09.195
<i>Then again, maybe I would.</i>

40:10.341 --> 40:13.674
<i>And... cut.</i>

40:13.744 --> 40:16.736
<i>That works pretty well for me.
I don't understand you guys.</i>

40:16.814 --> 40:21.183
There's only one Marilyn Monroe,
and those are her lines!

40:21.252 --> 40:24.278
Why don't we try the scene
where I ask you to stay with me?

40:24.355 --> 40:27.290
<i>I think Gable's interested in her.</i>

40:27.358 --> 40:29.622
Well, of course he is.
Aren't you?

40:29.693 --> 40:34.130
Look. If Marilyn can't pull herself
together, maybe we can get Liz.

40:34.198 --> 40:37.634
Call her agent when
we're through. Yeah.

40:37.701 --> 40:40.226
In the meantime,
keep your mouth shut, Junior.

40:40.304 --> 40:43.068
You're liable to get credit
for discovering the starlet.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.199
<i>I hope you can stay on here.</i>

40:45.276 --> 40:47.403
Any chance?

40:47.478 --> 40:49.503
Would it make any difference?

40:49.580 --> 40:52.242
It might make all the difference.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.284
Shall we dance?

41:01.592 --> 41:04.618
I haven't danced like this... ever.

41:04.695 --> 41:07.186
Not even with your wife?

41:07.264 --> 41:09.528
She was nothing like you.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.160
She had no style, no grace.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.966
<i>Why didn't you teach
your wife to be graceful?</i>

41:27.451 --> 41:30.579
<i>- May I cut in?
- Not a moment too soon.</i>

41:30.654 --> 41:32.645
Cross your fingers.

41:33.691 --> 41:36.956
You were saying?
Well, I, uh- I-

41:37.027 --> 41:39.860
Why didn't you teach her
to be graceful?

41:39.930 --> 41:44.230
Well, gracefulness isn't something
you can teach or learn.

41:44.301 --> 41:48.465
You've either got it or not.
How do you know for sure?

41:48.539 --> 41:52.066
Your wife died before
she ever got to see you dance.

41:52.142 --> 41:55.771
<i>Somehow, at this moment, I don't
feel like discussing my wife.</i>

41:55.846 --> 41:58.781
What I meant was,

41:58.849 --> 42:01.249
when you really love someone,

42:01.318 --> 42:04.776
<i>you both should be willing
to teach each other everything.</i>

42:06.657 --> 42:10.423
We're all dying. Aren't we?

42:10.494 --> 42:13.088
All of us.

42:13.163 --> 42:15.154
Old folks...

42:15.232 --> 42:17.359
and kids,

42:17.434 --> 42:19.925
husbands and wives,

42:21.839 --> 42:24.330
and we're not learning a damn thing.

42:35.352 --> 42:39.152
Barbara, why don't you
get us all some orange juice?

42:44.061 --> 42:47.053
<i>That was lovely.
Well, that's it, Sam.</i>

42:47.131 --> 42:51.465
Marilyn does the film, and a lot of people
say it's the best work of her career.

42:52.469 --> 42:55.666
Um, and, uh, get this-

42:55.739 --> 42:58.401
They re-title the film
at Marilyn's insistence-

42:58.475 --> 43:00.602
because of something that you said.

43:00.678 --> 43:03.112
<i>What do they name it?
The Misfits.</i>

43:03.180 --> 43:05.114
<i>The-</i>

43:07.151 --> 43:09.176
<i>You've done wonderful work-
What about Marilyn?</i>

43:09.253 --> 43:12.950
<i>She dies in August, 1962.</i>

43:13.023 --> 43:16.083
Barbiturate overdose
and alcohol complications.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.754
But that's the same thing
that hap-

43:18.829 --> 43:22.890
I know. There's some
things you just can't fix.

43:24.335 --> 43:27.771
Are you telling me that I saved her
life so she could be in one last picture?

43:29.006 --> 43:31.634
<i>But what a picture.
Dennis.</i>

43:31.709 --> 43:34.041
Dennis?

43:34.111 --> 43:36.409
Marilyn.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.983
No, don't-

43:50.060 --> 43:53.962
<i>Samuel? What's wrong?</i>

43:54.031 --> 43:56.659
It was him. He was here.

43:57.801 --> 44:00.235
Who was here?
Bigfoot.

44:00.304 --> 44:03.171
<i>"Bigfoot"?
I swear it was him.</i>

44:04.475 --> 44:06.409
Oh, boy.
