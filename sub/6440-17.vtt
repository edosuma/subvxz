00:36.836 --> 00:38.565
Tyler.

00:41.374 --> 00:45.970
- I missed you.
- Missed you too, Mom.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.743
Did you get my postcards?

00:49.382 --> 00:51.816
I didn't think you'd come.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.451
- I'm getting the doctor.
- Wait, Tyler.

00:59.626 --> 01:02.857
I asked you to come home
for a reason.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.528
I need you to help me.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.905
I want you to help me die, Tyler.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.840
Don't talk like that,
you're gonna get well.

01:20.013 --> 01:24.109
I want to be buried back home,
in Smallville.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.252
You have to be strong, Mom.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.121
I can't fight this anymore.

01:35.061 --> 01:38.895
If you love me, you'll do this for me.

02:27.113 --> 02:28.671
I love you, Mom.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.643
And I love you, Tyler.

02:53.873 --> 02:57.036
Oh, my God, security!
Get me security now!

02:57.210 --> 02:58.609
Get away from her!

02:58.778 --> 03:00.507
- She was in pain!
- What's going on?

03:00.680 --> 03:01.942
I think he killed her.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.375
Let go! Let go! Let go!

03:13.426 --> 03:19.888
Tyler Randall, male Caucasian.
Body has multiple fracture injuries...

03:20.066 --> 03:23.558
...consistent with a high fall
of more than 20 feet.

03:23.903 --> 03:28.363
Subject's neck is broken
just below the axis.

03:29.542 --> 03:33.000
What've we got here? Let's see.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.773
Man, that's gotta hurt.

03:45.725 --> 03:50.389
Subject has unknown rock fragment...

03:50.663 --> 03:56.363
...wedged between the brachioradialis
and the flexors of the right forearm.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.968
Come on, come on.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.869
Possibly the result of impact.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.678
Okay, Tyler, let's take a look
under the hood.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.950
Well, here we are.

05:58.124 --> 06:01.992
I'm only asking for two hours! I'm sorry
to cut into your busy social schedule.

06:02.161 --> 06:05.130
It's not that. I don't mind helping
out for a good cause...

06:05.298 --> 06:07.766
- ... it's just all these people are-
- Old and sick?

06:08.801 --> 06:11.167
It's hard to deal with.
There's nothing we can do.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.135
You're right, you can't save them
from old age and illness...

06:14.307 --> 06:17.367
...but that's not the point.
You're saving them from loneliness.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.574
Don't forget the irises.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.338
You excited about the big fishing trip
with your dad next weekend?

06:24.517 --> 06:25.848
You didn't forget, did you?

06:26.018 --> 06:28.578
How could I? We've been
going every year since I was 7.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.918
Ten hours in a rowboat, swatting
mosquitoes, looking for ripples.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.787
- I thought you enjoyed fishing.
- I did when I was younger.

06:34.961 --> 06:38.226
- If you don't want to go, tell him.
- I don't want to hurt his feelings.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.026
He may not like it,
but he needs to know.

06:41.901 --> 06:46.770
Martha, Clark, I'd like you to meet
Tyler Randall, new volunteer.

06:46.939 --> 06:48.964
- I want you to show him the ropes.
- Hi.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.973
Hank says you grow the best
organic produce outside Metropolis.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.479
- You just made a friend for life.
- So, what brings you to Smallville?

06:56.649 --> 06:59.777
I came back to make funeral
preparations. I recently lost my mother.

07:00.219 --> 07:01.880
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.249
Why don't we get to the deliveries?

07:04.424 --> 07:07.154
We can start with Mrs. Sikes.
She'll be happy to see us.

07:07.326 --> 07:11.160
- Her dog Pepper, on the other hand...
- Pepper's not so bad.

07:13.065 --> 07:18.196
Hi, Pepper, hi! How are you today?
Pepper, this is Tyler.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.268
Don't worry, she's probably hungry.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.841
I'll get her something to eat.

07:24.010 --> 07:27.275
A lot of our clients are elderly
and housebound, like Mrs. Sikes.

07:27.814 --> 07:30.339
Good morning, Mrs. Sikes.
How are you feeling today?

07:30.516 --> 07:31.915
Terrible.

07:32.485 --> 07:37.354
- Is that Clark? He looks different.
- No, this is Tyler, our new driver.

07:37.523 --> 07:38.956
Let me.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.089
How about some lunch, Mrs. Sikes?

07:43.930 --> 07:47.525
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

07:48.568 --> 07:54.302
- My pills, give me my, get my-
- Isn't there anything we can do for her?

07:54.807 --> 07:56.798
I wish there were.

07:58.044 --> 08:02.640
One of Mrs. Kent's beautiful irises.
For a beautiful lady.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.580
Don't ever get old and sick, son.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.387
The world got no use for you.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.819
I'll tell you what.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.065
I'll bring you another iris tomorrow.

08:21.167 --> 08:26.503
I like roses. White ones.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.470
White ones it is.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.503
I like this one, Martha.

08:40.119 --> 08:43.316
Your father's very disappointed
with you, Lex.

08:44.657 --> 08:48.252
My father's disappointment is perennial,
only the circumstances change.

08:48.427 --> 08:49.917
What do you want, Dominic?

08:50.096 --> 08:55.966
An internal audit of your division has
turned up accounting irregularities.

08:56.135 --> 09:00.003
And I've been authorized to come down
and go through it in a thorough manner.

09:01.607 --> 09:06.601
So this is payback for turning down my
father's offer to join him in Metropolis.

09:06.779 --> 09:10.306
Lionel has been very tolerant
of your excesses.

09:10.483 --> 09:14.544
But this time you didn't spend
the money on parties and sports cars.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.847
He wants to know where it went.

09:18.758 --> 09:22.091
Do you know what my father gave me
for my 10th birthday?

09:22.261 --> 09:24.661
<i>A copy of The Will to Power.</i>

09:24.897 --> 09:29.561
"Behold the superman.
Man is something to be overcome. "

09:30.169 --> 09:33.764
Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Nietzsche...

09:33.940 --> 09:37.501
...they were the voices that
nurtured me after my mother died.

09:37.843 --> 09:41.370
My father made every question a quiz.
Every choice a test.

09:42.148 --> 09:45.777
Second best was for losers.
Compassion, for the weak. Trust no one.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.886
Those are the lessons I grew up with.

09:48.254 --> 09:52.190
I'll remember that if I'm ever
interviewed by the Biography Channel.

09:53.859 --> 09:59.388
All I'm saying, Dominic, is try
and remember who I was raised by.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.962
I try to deny it,
but I'm still my father's son.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.961
Tread carefully.

10:07.873 --> 10:10.398
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.475
Looks like a real page-turner.

10:18.651 --> 10:21.211
My father and I have
our annual fishing trip.

10:21.387 --> 10:25.448
Of course you do. My father
and I went on a fishing trip once.

10:25.625 --> 10:30.085
- He doesn't seem like the fishing type.
- He's not. We were the bait.

10:30.529 --> 10:35.523
We flew to South Australia, got up-close
and personal with a couple of great whites.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.896
Sounds like a real Kodak moment.

10:38.070 --> 10:42.302
When you're rich and untouchable like he is,
you do things to make yourself feel alive.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.806
Why'd you go?

10:43.976 --> 10:47.935
Because he didn't think I would. We
never went on another father-son trip.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.708
I wish my father would do something
other than fishing.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.612
How about a football game?

10:52.785 --> 10:56.221
I've got two tickets for the skybox at
the Metropolis Sharks game Sunday.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.852
They're yours.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.686
That'd be great. My father's followed
the team all season.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.057
- I wouldn't even have to twist his arm.
- Problem solved.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.910
Lana, what is it?

11:22.948 --> 11:27.510
That was Whitney's mom,
his dad just had another heart attack.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.305
Whoa, whoa!

11:51.210 --> 11:54.873
It is not a good idea to sneak up on
somebody with an acetylene torch.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.642
I'm sorry. My name's Dominic Senatori,
I work for Lionel Luthor.

11:59.719 --> 12:04.952
I'm here following up on a research
project Lex Luthor recently instigated.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.116
If you don't mind, I've got
a lot of work to do around here.

12:08.294 --> 12:13.823
There was an incident involving your
son and Lex's Porsche and a bridge.

12:13.999 --> 12:17.696
Lex has spent a considerable amount of
time and capital researching the crash...

12:17.870 --> 12:19.963
...and I was wondering
if you knew why.

12:20.139 --> 12:23.472
Look, the truth is, Lex Luthor
was driving like a maniac.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.633
His car went off the bridge
into the water...

12:25.811 --> 12:29.508
...my son jumped in, risked his life to
save him, that's the end of the story.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.446
You wouldn't know why he
commissioned an in-depth profile...

12:32.618 --> 12:34.518
...into you and your family.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.526
I have no idea.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.730
Fair enough, Mr. Kent.
Thanks for your time.

12:49.735 --> 12:54.069
Just out of curiosity, what were
Lex's findings on the crash?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.582
Whitney, is that you?

13:07.987 --> 13:10.478
It's Clark Kent, Mr. Fordman.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.055
Lana.

13:14.527 --> 13:18.987
Well, where's Whitney?
I haven't seen my son yet.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.725
Don't worry, he'll be here soon.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.362
- Where is Whitney?
- I don't know.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.072
His mom said he'd be here.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.717
Clark, how's Whitney's dad?

13:46.892 --> 13:49.452
- He's hanging in there.
- That's good.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.465
- You remember this?
- It's my first fishing rod.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.625
You used to practice casting
it out in the paddock all day.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.703
- I remember.
- In fact...

13:59.872 --> 14:04.366
...I remember I used to have to pry it
out of your hands to get you to go to bed.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.371
Dad, what would you say if we could
be sitting in the deluxe box...

14:08.547 --> 14:11.482
...next Sunday watching
the Metropolis Sharks?

14:12.218 --> 14:14.550
I'd say the Milk River's
changed quite a bit.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.979
Think about it.

14:18.424 --> 14:21.359
No worms, no cold mornings,
no eating canned peaches.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.395
Wait a minute. Did Lex Luthor
arrange all this for us?

14:26.465 --> 14:31.493
Clark, this morning I had a surprise
visit from one of Lionel Luthor's people.

14:31.670 --> 14:35.333
Did you know Lex Luthor was having us
investigated after the bridge accident?

14:35.507 --> 14:38.476
Yeah, but Lex said that was all
in our past. He promised.

14:43.148 --> 14:47.642
- You knew and you didn't tell me?
- Because I knew you'd react like this.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.085
I thought we had an understanding.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.783
How am I to protect you
if you won't give me the facts?

14:54.960 --> 14:58.452
- I don't need protection.
- When it comes to your secret you do.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.293
When you get older,
you'll understand my apprehension...

15:01.467 --> 15:04.163
- ... about the Luthor family.
- Stop treating me like a kid.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.305
I'm not 7 anymore,
I'm not casting lines in the paddock.

15:07.473 --> 15:11.569
I don't even like fishing, the only reason
I do it is because it makes you happy!

15:18.384 --> 15:20.249
That didn't come out right.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.983
No, son, I think it did.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.520
Pepper?

16:03.362 --> 16:04.829
Pepper.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.200
I brought you a white rose.

16:35.694 --> 16:40.597
You've lived so long with pain.
Sometimes don't you wish it would just end?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.560
Oh, yes.

16:43.869 --> 16:48.238
I can't go on, not like this.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.705
It'll all be over soon.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.403
I promise.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.877
Where's Dad?

17:29.048 --> 17:32.848
He wanted to get an early start,
said he had a lot of work to do today.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.211
He's avoiding me, isn't he?

17:35.387 --> 17:38.356
I'm not gonna play referee.
You two need to work this out.

17:38.524 --> 17:41.516
We will. First we'll have a week
of uncomfortable silence...

17:41.693 --> 17:45.220
...then we'll talk about something
trivial. And then we'll move on.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.498
Avoiding it and hoping the problem
goes away isn't dealing with it.

17:50.669 --> 17:54.833
- You know how stubborn he can be.
- I know how stubborn you both can be.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.531
I don't want you to drift apart...

17:56.708 --> 17:59.268
- ... like he did with his father.
- I thought they were close.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.073
They were, but they kept things
from each other.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.908
When your grandfather passed away...

18:04.083 --> 18:07.883
...there was a lot your dad didn't
get to tell him, a lot he regrets.

18:09.054 --> 18:12.114
I just don't want to see
history repeat itself.

18:18.931 --> 18:23.834
Chloe, I just got your note. I can't
believe it. I just saw Mrs. Sikes yesterday.

18:24.002 --> 18:27.165
- I know. I'm sorry, Clark.
- What happened?

18:27.539 --> 18:31.305
The official story is, there was a fire.
But all they found were her ashes.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.707
- And the unofficial?
- Spontaneous combustion.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.074
She thinks the old lady
just burst into flames.

18:36.248 --> 18:41.117
"October 1978. Joyce Maslow was
dancing in Elizabeth, New Jersey...

18:41.286 --> 18:44.346
...when flames burst from her head
and back, enveloping her.

18:44.690 --> 18:49.252
In seconds she was a human torch,
consumed before her horrified boyfriend. "

18:49.428 --> 18:52.591
- You don't have to look so happy.
- I'm not happy, I'm intrigued.

18:52.764 --> 18:55.324
Which means you're still
gonna look into it.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.765
- Am I that transparent?
- Yes.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.204
Mr. Kent?

19:07.479 --> 19:11.040
- Clark isn't here.
- Actually, I came to see you.

19:11.216 --> 19:14.708
I was wondering if you're planning
on coming to the game next Sunday.

19:14.953 --> 19:18.081
I'm going fishing, Lex,
I don't know what my son is doing.

19:19.291 --> 19:23.694
- The tickets were meant as a gift.
- I'm sure your intentions were noble.

19:27.933 --> 19:31.926
That's not fair. I don't think you understand
how I regard Clark and your family.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.766
Yes I do, I understand perfectly well.

19:34.940 --> 19:38.432
We're just the pawns in your eternal
chess game with your dad.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.611
- Do you have a family photo?
- Yeah, I've got lots of family photos.

19:43.115 --> 19:47.347
The only picture of my father and me
appears in the LuthorCorp annual report.

19:48.587 --> 19:51.317
Is this the part where I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?

19:51.490 --> 19:53.481
No, I just want you to understand...

19:53.659 --> 19:56.822
...if I'm guilty of anything
regarding your family, it's envy.

19:57.462 --> 20:00.727
If you're so envious of my family,
then why do you feel the need...

20:00.899 --> 20:03.527
...to investigate it behind my back?

20:05.103 --> 20:07.970
I wanted to know what happened
the day of the accident.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.743
I had a theory and it was false.
I was totally up-front with Clark about it.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.505
That's what this is about.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.980
- Clark wasn't up-front with you.
- He's a good kid.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.585
- I don't want that to change.
- Neither do I.

20:26.758 --> 20:28.157
You know...

20:29.328 --> 20:32.855
...from the day I first met Clark,
all you've ever seen is the name Luthor.

20:33.031 --> 20:36.728
Well, so far you haven't given
me a reason to see anything else.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.142
See that Kansas State game last week?

20:53.685 --> 20:56.654
What are you doing here, Clark?
Lana send you?

20:58.123 --> 21:00.591
I told her you'd see it coming
a mile away.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.488
Hey, I'm not angry.

21:05.196 --> 21:08.131
So, you've come to find out
why the heartless son...

21:08.300 --> 21:11.758
...hasn't gone by the hospital
to visit his dying father.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.598
Something like that.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.369
I remember how my dad used to say
how he'd be there the day...

21:20.545 --> 21:22.775
...I threw my first pass for the Sharks.

21:23.648 --> 21:26.811
- He said it so often, I actually believed it.
- He still could.

21:29.020 --> 21:32.615
My father was the strongest man
I ever knew.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.952
He lettered in three sports at State.

21:38.563 --> 21:43.694
When I see him there
in the hospital so weak...

21:45.370 --> 21:48.237
...it kills me because
that's not my father.

21:51.309 --> 21:57.214
Whatever you do, for a long time to come,
your father is gonna be there to support you.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.652
I'll only have a memory of my dad.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.684
And I don't want that memory to be...

22:06.424 --> 22:11.020
...of that sick man laying there
in the hospital.

22:19.404 --> 22:20.894
Now I get it.

22:21.072 --> 22:25.941
It's just... I'd take the man over
the memory any day of the week.

22:38.089 --> 22:41.923
<i>Clark, I've been looking all over for you.
Look what I found in the Daily Planet.</i>

22:42.761 --> 22:46.288
- "Body Disappears From Metropolis Morgue"?
- Yeah, but look at the photo.

22:47.499 --> 22:50.229
The coroner's body
was disintegrated into ash.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.035
Just like Mrs. Sikes.

22:52.203 --> 22:55.661
I don't know, but it would be nice
to check out that house for ourselves.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.476
You know this is a crime scene.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.083
So?

23:09.120 --> 23:11.816
Well, there's no other sign
of fire damage anywhere.

23:11.990 --> 23:15.892
You might want to dial back on that
"spontaneous combustion" skepticism.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.393
- No barking.
- Wasn't planning on it.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.955
- Pepper.
- Who's Pepper?

23:21.599 --> 23:23.032
Mrs. Sikes' dog.

23:23.201 --> 23:26.102
She turned into a barking
machine anytime somebody came over.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.034
Pepper? Come here, girl.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.697
Well, Animal Shelter probably
came and got her.

23:47.392 --> 23:50.452
- Oh, no.
- Don't tell me that's Pepper.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.009
What happened
may have been combustion...

24:12.217 --> 24:14.879
...but I have a feeling
it wasn't spontaneous.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.560
- Well, afternoon, Martha.
- Hi.

24:28.733 --> 24:30.894
I didn't know that you
were volunteering today.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.867
Dropping off some produce,
didn't want it to go to waste.

24:34.038 --> 24:37.940
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- I've got it. Just close that for me.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.441
All right. I'll be in the office
if you need me.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.050
Tyler! What are you doing here?

24:56.294 --> 24:58.421
Here, let me help you with this.

25:07.806 --> 25:09.899
Mrs. Sikes. That was you.

25:10.074 --> 25:13.237
- Martha, you okay?
- Hank, call the Sheriff.

25:13.411 --> 25:15.402
What's going on here?
Hold it right there.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.104
Hank, no!

25:46.211 --> 25:47.542
Mom.

25:49.113 --> 25:50.410
Get away from her.

25:50.582 --> 25:52.607
Clark, don't touch him!

25:57.589 --> 25:59.819
Clark, are you okay?

26:29.420 --> 26:32.821
Son, your mom is... She's resting.

26:33.858 --> 26:36.827
She's pretty shaken up but
I think she's gonna be fine.

26:38.229 --> 26:40.663
Police are looking everywhere for Tyler.

26:41.532 --> 26:44.797
- I don't think they're gonna stop him.
- Why?

26:46.271 --> 26:49.365
Because I saw his heart.
It wasn't beating.

26:49.540 --> 26:54.102
Clark, that doesn't make any sense.
How can he walk around if he's dead?

26:54.279 --> 26:56.713
How can he turn people to ash?

26:58.783 --> 27:02.947
When he touched my face, I felt like
the life was being drained out of me.

27:04.822 --> 27:06.813
- Clark, you sure that you-
- Yeah.

27:23.675 --> 27:24.937
Dad?

27:25.843 --> 27:27.208
Yeah?

27:30.648 --> 27:32.138
Nothing.

27:58.209 --> 28:02.168
Clark, I heard what happened
at Mobile Meals. Is your mom all right?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.679
- Yeah.
- Can't believe Tyler would hurt anybody.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.874
- He seemed so nice.
- If you run into him...

28:07.051 --> 28:09.315
...whatever you do,
don't let him touch you.

28:09.921 --> 28:12.617
Long story, just trust me.

28:13.391 --> 28:16.417
Whitney phoned. He wanted
to get together later and talk.

28:16.594 --> 28:17.925
That's great.

28:18.229 --> 28:22.097
I don't know what you said,
but thank you.

28:24.168 --> 28:25.499
Gotta go.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.404
Hi, Lana.

28:30.842 --> 28:35.779
Clark, glad I ran into you. I need
to talk to you about the Sharks game.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.875
- Is your dad coming?
- I'm not sure.

28:40.752 --> 28:44.210
Funny. When I asked him,
he was pretty adamant he wasn't going.

28:45.723 --> 28:49.625
I'm rescinding the offer.
Go fishing with your dad.

28:49.794 --> 28:52.820
- Lex, you don't have to do that.
- I know.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.261
But your dad wants
to spend some time with you.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.628
It's not something
I want to come between.

28:57.802 --> 29:00.862
He's just trying to give you
something my father never gave me.

29:01.039 --> 29:03.234
- What's that?
- Limitations.

29:03.408 --> 29:07.538
All my father ever told me was "Don't
get caught. Don't cause a scandal. "

29:07.712 --> 29:11.011
That's not love, that's public relations.

29:11.816 --> 29:14.478
You have no idea how lucky you are.

29:14.652 --> 29:17.587
When my father dies,
kings will come to his funeral.

29:17.755 --> 29:21.748
But when yours does,
his friends will come.

29:37.909 --> 29:40.343
Nell told me she saw
you come out here.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.345
Yeah.

29:45.216 --> 29:48.708
I just realized that in all the time
we've known each other...

29:49.554 --> 29:53.354
- ... I've never been here before.
- It's okay, Whitney.

29:53.825 --> 29:56.385
No, it's not.

29:58.396 --> 30:01.627
It's just, the thought of losing
my parents was so awful...

30:02.100 --> 30:04.591
...I didn't want to think about it.

30:05.169 --> 30:08.104
That's why you need
to talk to your father.

30:08.406 --> 30:12.433
Go see him, Whitney. Make the best
of the time he has left.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.821
Thanks, Lana.

30:28.226 --> 30:32.094
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

30:32.897 --> 30:36.731
- Do you want me to walk you home?
- Think I'm gonna stay.

30:37.268 --> 30:39.668
Haven't been out here in a while.

30:40.538 --> 30:41.971
Okay.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.170
Whitney?

31:25.550 --> 31:28.110
It's all right, I won't hurt you.

31:28.286 --> 31:31.517
I don't want to hurt anyone, Lana.
I only want to bring them peace.

31:34.392 --> 31:39.295
I heard your friend talking.
His father must be in terrible pain.

31:39.797 --> 31:41.890
I can help your friend.

31:57.048 --> 32:01.610
Then there's the discrepancy between
the purchasing and shipping records.

32:01.786 --> 32:08.191
Stop. I know my father authorized this,
but enough bean-counting for one day.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.427
Thirty-year-old single malt.

32:13.097 --> 32:17.124
Also bought with my father's money.
Make sure you jot that down.

32:18.102 --> 32:21.731
Let's be frank, Dominic. My father
sent you here to spy on me because...

32:21.906 --> 32:23.669
...he's afraid of how well I'm doing.

32:23.841 --> 32:28.210
This was my last chance to prove
myself and he just assumed I'd fail.

32:28.379 --> 32:32.110
Now he has to revise
his definition of me.

32:32.316 --> 32:34.614
I'm not just his screwup son anymore.

32:36.420 --> 32:41.722
Now I'm competition. My father only knows
one way of dealing with competition.

32:42.560 --> 32:46.860
There are some things better left
between patient and therapist, Lex.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.994
You know, in ancient Persia...

32:52.169 --> 32:56.230
...the kings would kill a messenger who
brought them news they didn't like.

32:57.074 --> 33:01.841
In modern times, a sword in the chest
might seem a little extreme...

33:02.013 --> 33:04.709
...something more subtle
would be in order.

33:05.716 --> 33:07.843
Enjoying your drink?

33:22.900 --> 33:24.663
That's disgusting.

33:24.835 --> 33:28.828
I guess I should have mentioned the
"May not be suitable for all ages" disclaimer.

33:29.006 --> 33:31.406
- Your friend Tyler's been busy.
- What do you mean?

33:31.575 --> 33:36.774
He tried to kill his mother, rose from
the dead, and escaped from the morgue.

33:37.248 --> 33:42.276
My buddy Chad works weekends for the
M.E. He zip-filed the toxicology report.

33:42.453 --> 33:44.887
Besides that fatal amount
of painkillers...

33:45.056 --> 33:48.321
...they found fragments of an unknown
green stone embedded in his skin.

33:49.427 --> 33:50.689
Meteor rocks.

33:50.861 --> 33:53.853
Then why aren't all Smallville's dead bodies
rising from the grave?

33:54.231 --> 33:59.066
The combo of painkillers and meteor
rocks caused Tyler to pull a "Thriller. "

33:59.236 --> 34:01.466
Didn't you say Tyler
tried to kill his mother?

34:01.839 --> 34:05.502
Tried and failed. His mother
recovered enough to be sent home.

34:06.143 --> 34:08.976
- Clark, I just left Tyler in the graveyard.
- Are you okay?

34:09.146 --> 34:12.775
He heard Whitney talking about his
father, he said he could bring him peace.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.710
Did you call the police?

34:17.154 --> 34:18.746
Where are you going?

34:21.559 --> 34:24.289
Don't look at me,
he does that all the time.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.248
- Dad?
- He can't hear you.

34:58.596 --> 35:02.191
- Who are you?
- I've come to help your father. And you.

35:10.574 --> 35:12.474
I can end your pain.

35:13.677 --> 35:15.440
I know what you're feeling...

35:17.848 --> 35:19.748
...how much it hurts.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.819
But I can make it all go away.

35:38.335 --> 35:39.700
Tyler, don't!

35:46.177 --> 35:50.045
I heard your friend, Clark. Seeing his
father like this is tearing him apart.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.243
- I can give them peace.
- It's not your decision.

35:53.818 --> 35:57.015
You're wrong. I have to help him.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.719
You're not taking away their pain.

36:05.896 --> 36:08.421
You're stealing Whitney's
last chance to be with his father.

36:08.799 --> 36:10.994
You can't stop me, Clark.

36:11.469 --> 36:12.993
No one can.

36:13.170 --> 36:17.664
Don't you see? It's better. I know,
I could see it in my mother's eyes.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.707
Your mother's alive.

36:20.878 --> 36:25.315
She recovered after that night.
They brought her home to Smallville.

36:25.716 --> 36:28.310
- I thought-
- She's alive, Tyler.

36:28.486 --> 36:30.454
Let me take you to her.

36:46.237 --> 36:48.068
It's a miracle.

36:48.939 --> 36:53.035
It's life. As long as
we have that, there's still hope.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.809
She seems so peaceful.

37:02.753 --> 37:06.553
I thought that I was brought back
to relieve the suffering of others.

37:06.757 --> 37:08.725
But it was my pain all along.

37:13.697 --> 37:16.063
- What have I done?
- Tyler.

37:18.469 --> 37:20.437
I just want it all to be over.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.479
Tyler?

37:51.001 --> 37:54.334
Interesting choice of location
for a meeting, Lex.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.034
Why didn't you come up
to the penthouse?

38:01.211 --> 38:04.612
I was making a garbage delivery,
I didn't want to tarnish the marble.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.545
I'm not in the mood to joust, Lex.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.942
I was hoping you'd
explain Dominic's visit.

38:09.119 --> 38:14.318
My auditors discovered unaccounted
expenditures coming out of Smallville.

38:14.491 --> 38:16.925
- I thought it prudent to investigate.
- Come on, Dad.

38:17.094 --> 38:20.757
I've squandered more in a weekend. You
didn't sic your adding machines on me then.

38:20.931 --> 38:25.231
No, we're talking corporate finances,
Lex, not your pocket money.

38:25.402 --> 38:27.336
It bothers you, doesn't it?

38:28.038 --> 38:30.438
That I'm not dependent on you anymore.

38:30.608 --> 38:33.099
That I've made friends in Smallville,
people I trust.

38:33.277 --> 38:36.542
Don't be ridiculous, Lex.
I'm happy you're doing well.

38:36.714 --> 38:40.912
No, you're not. You're afraid
I won't need you anymore.

38:46.557 --> 38:49.048
You'll always be my son.

38:51.228 --> 38:54.664
And you will always need me, Lex.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.357
Aren't you going to ask about Dominic?

38:59.069 --> 39:04.632
He hasn't checked in for hours, has he?
Unusual for a man of his predictable nature.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.607
Go ahead...

39:11.415 --> 39:13.383
...pop the trunk.

39:14.051 --> 39:18.886
Ah, Lex, what has he done,
what has he done?

39:31.168 --> 39:34.660
You want to ask an accounting question,
Dad? Call me.

39:34.838 --> 39:37.466
The next time one of your drones
bothers the Kents...

39:37.608 --> 39:40.338
...he'll be lucky to catch a ride
home with the spare.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.480
Lex.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.883
Well done.

40:03.367 --> 40:06.427
<i>Now playing quarterback
for your Metropolis Sharks...</i>

40:06.603 --> 40:10.505
<i>...number 12, Whitney Fordman!</i>

40:11.375 --> 40:13.468
Down, set, hut!

40:14.511 --> 40:17.378
Hut, hut, hut!

40:24.088 --> 40:25.453
Yes!

40:32.029 --> 40:34.998
- You all right, Dad?
- Never better.

40:46.677 --> 40:49.703
That's a really nice thing
you've done for the Fordmans.

40:51.315 --> 40:55.615
Thanks, Mr. Kent.
That means a lot coming from you.

40:56.887 --> 41:01.881
I just want you to know, I closed
the book on that day at the bridge.

41:02.059 --> 41:04.619
Why'd you investigate it
in the first place?

41:05.529 --> 41:07.656
That day was a miracle.

41:08.398 --> 41:11.697
Haven't you ever wanted to find out
why things like that happen?

41:14.171 --> 41:15.433
No.

41:16.473 --> 41:18.998
I just accept the fact that they do.

41:20.844 --> 41:23.870
You don't need an explanation
for everything, Lex.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.011
How did he get the Metropolis Sharks
to do it?

41:32.189 --> 41:36.125
When your father owns the team,
it's easier to pull some strings.

41:36.293 --> 41:39.626
It's strange, all this time
I never thought Lex even liked Whitney.

41:39.797 --> 41:42.265
And then he goes and arranges all this.

41:42.432 --> 41:45.333
I think Lex feels
he's become part of our lives.

41:45.502 --> 41:47.595
I'd like to believe that.

41:50.073 --> 41:52.371
You asked him, didn't you?

41:53.477 --> 41:58.380
Being friends with Lex Luthor can be
complicated, but it has advantages.

42:00.651 --> 42:02.846
- What was that for?
- Just being you.

42:26.510 --> 42:30.173
- Dad, I'm sorry. What I said, it-
- Clark...

42:31.415 --> 42:36.648
...the fishing trips, they never
had anything to do with fishing.

42:37.487 --> 42:40.684
It was just that I wanted
to spend some time with my son.

42:43.527 --> 42:49.227
My dad and I, we saw each other
every day but we never really talked.

42:51.335 --> 42:54.168
I just don't want history
to repeat itself.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.998
That makes two of us.

43:09.453 --> 43:11.819
Dad, I know how we can catch
more fish this year.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.456
What, new lures?

43:13.624 --> 43:15.216
X- ray vision.

43:16.305 --> 43:22.932
