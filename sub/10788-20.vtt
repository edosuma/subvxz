WEBVTT

00:32.500 --> 00:33.291
GOOD MORNING.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.917
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

00:38.917 --> 00:40.667
HOW DID YOU SLEEP?

00:40.667 --> 00:43.375
[SIGHS] WELL,
BETWEEN THE TALKING

00:43.375 --> 00:46.291
IN THE SLEEP
AND THE STEALING
ALL THE COVERS,

00:46.291 --> 00:47.792
NOT TOO WELL,
ACTUALLY.

00:47.792 --> 00:50.208
THAT DROOL STAIN ON YOUR
PILLOW BEGS TO DIFFER.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.959
THAT'S NOT DROOL!

00:51.959 --> 00:53.208
LIKE A BASSET HOUND.

00:53.208 --> 00:54.667
I DO NOT DROOL,

00:54.667 --> 00:56.208
AND IF YOU TELL
ANYONE I DO,

00:56.208 --> 00:58.041
THEN I'LL JUST
MENTION HOW YOU
MOAN IN YOUR SLEEP

00:58.041 --> 00:59.917
ABOUT YOUR MOM
TAKING AWAY
YOUR BARBIE DOLLS.

00:59.917 --> 01:00.875
OK, I DIDN'T--

01:00.875 --> 01:03.667
ONLY FOR ABOUT
20 MINUTES.

01:03.667 --> 01:06.250
OK, IN THAT CASE,
I SAW NO DROOL.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.417
[LAUGHING]

01:09.875 --> 01:12.250
YOU KNOW WHAT MY
FAVORITE THING
ABOUT IT IS?

01:12.250 --> 01:13.542
WHAT?

01:13.542 --> 01:16.458
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
I GOT THAT SCAR?

01:16.458 --> 01:18.458
NO.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.375
DO YOU KNOW WHO
MY SIXTH GRADE
TEACHER WAS?

01:20.375 --> 01:21.583
NO. MINE WAS MRS.--

01:21.583 --> 01:24.750
SHH! YOU'RE RUINING
MY FAVORITE THING.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.417
OK, I'M SORRY.

01:27.417 --> 01:30.250
OK, YOU LOST ME
AT THE SCAR.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.583
THE POINT IS,

01:31.583 --> 01:34.083
I WASN'T THERE FOR
EVERY DAY OF YOUR
LIFE UP UNTIL NOW,

01:34.083 --> 01:37.083
AND YOU WEREN'T HERE
EVERY DAY OF MINE.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.834
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A GOOD THING?

01:38.834 --> 01:42.000
LIVING WITHOUT
THE WEIGHT OF 18 YEARS
OF EXPECTATION?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.083
YES, IT'S A GOOD THING.

01:44.083 --> 01:45.875
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.166
AT THIS POINT,
ALL I REALLY
KNOW ABOUT YOU

01:48.166 --> 01:50.500
AND YOUR CHILDHOOD
IS THAT...

01:50.500 --> 01:52.166
YOU USED TO PLAY
WITH BARBIE DOLLS.

01:52.166 --> 01:56.917
OK, IT WASN'T A DOLL.
ALL RIGHT? IT WAS M--

01:56.917 --> 01:59.291
OK. SO MAYBE IT WAS.

01:59.291 --> 02:01.959
BARBIE LOOKS
REALLY HOT NAKED.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.917
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.291
HEY, AND LOOK,
THERE ARE RULES
ABOUT INFORMATION

02:07.291 --> 02:08.750
OBTAINED WHILE IN BED.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.417
LOCKED AWAY.

02:11.417 --> 02:12.417
THANK YOU.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.291
SO, DID YOU HAVE
THE MALIBU BEACH HOUSE?

02:14.291 --> 02:18.291
BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANTED
THE MALIBU BEACH HOUSE.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.291
[LAUGHTER]

03:10.125 --> 03:11.750
SO YOU DIDN'T
READ THE MEMO?

03:11.750 --> 03:13.583
DO I LOOK LIKE THE KIND
OF GUY WHO READS MEMOS?

03:13.583 --> 03:16.166
IT WAS IN THE ENVELOPE
WITH OUR PAYCHECKS.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.875
IT CONTAINED THE PHRASE,
"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT."

03:17.875 --> 03:19.208
NONE OF THIS
RINGS ANY BELLS?

03:19.208 --> 03:20.542
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT DANNY'S GONE.

03:20.542 --> 03:23.250
I TALKED TO HIM
RIGHT BEFORE WE
WENT ON VACATION,

03:23.250 --> 03:24.291
AND HE DIDN'T MENTION
ANYTHING TO ME
ABOUT LEAVING.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.917
PACEY, NOT TO BURST
YOUR BOY-CRUSH BUBBLE,

03:26.917 --> 03:28.000
BUT DIDN'T DANNY
ALWAYS USED TO SAY

03:28.000 --> 03:29.750
THAT SOMEDAY YOU'D LOOK
UP AND HE'D BE GONE

03:29.750 --> 03:31.542
IN SEARCH OF GREATER
CULINARY ADVENTURES?

03:31.542 --> 03:33.208
YES, BUT I THINK
HE WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME FIRST.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.083
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU'D READ THE MEMO,

03:34.083 --> 03:35.291
YOU'D SEE
THAT DAY HAD COME.

03:35.291 --> 03:37.875
AUDREY, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.041
DANNY LOVES THIS PLACE.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.333
HE'S NOT GONNA JUST
UP AND QUIT.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.792
I DON'T THINK THAT HE
HAD ANY CHOICE, PACEY.

03:42.792 --> 03:45.375
DO YOU THINK
THEY WOULD FIRE DANNY?

03:45.375 --> 03:47.208
LIKE, I'M GOING TO
GO AWAY ON VACATION
FOR 5 DAYS,

03:47.208 --> 03:48.583
AND THE GUY'S
JUST GONNA DISAPPEAR.

03:48.583 --> 03:49.834
HE'S JUST GONNA
BE GONE.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.959
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SPEAK CORPORATE,

03:51.959 --> 03:54.083
BUT THE MEMO SOUNDED
LIKE SOME BIG CONGLOMERATE

03:54.083 --> 03:56.000
BOUGHT THE PLACE AND
WANTS TO TURN IT INTO
A CHAIN OR SOMETHING.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.041
SINCE WHEN DO WE HAVE
AN ORGANIZATION THAT
COMMUNICATES BY MEMO?

03:59.041 --> 04:02.834
SINCE NOW, APPARENTLY.

04:02.834 --> 04:07.583
"CLOSED FOR LUNCH,
STAFF MEETING WITH
NEW MANAGER AT 3:00."

04:09.291 --> 04:12.417
WOULD IT HAVE KILLED
SOMEONE TO CALL US?

04:12.417 --> 04:15.333
I AM SURE THAT THERE
IS A PERFECTLY
LOGICAL EXPLANATION

04:15.333 --> 04:16.375
FOR ALL OF THIS.

04:16.375 --> 04:19.375
LOGICAL, YES.
GOOD, NO.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.917
HEY, YOU ARE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THE NEWS I HAVE.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.834
CHARLIE, DON'T
THEY HAVE CLASSES
AT BOSTON BAY?

04:30.834 --> 04:33.000
WELL, YEAH, SURE,
BUT NO ONE GOES TO 'EM.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.375
EXPLAINS A LOT.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.375
SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

04:37.375 --> 04:38.750
YOU WERE WAITING
OUT HERE THIS
ENTIRE TIME--

04:38.750 --> 04:42.750
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I WAS NOT WAITING OUT
HERE THIS ENTIRE TIME.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.583
OK, WELL, MOST OF
THE TIME. ANYWAY,

04:44.583 --> 04:46.083
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT LUST TO LOVE?

04:46.083 --> 04:47.625
EXCUSE ME?
THEY'RE A BAND.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.917
LUST TO LOVE.
THEY'RE LIKE A GO-GOs
TRIBUTE THING.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.750
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO ACTUALLY WANT TO
RELIVE THE GO-GOs?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.291
YEAH, SURE, OF COURSE.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.750
I MEAN, THE GO-GOs
ROCKED, IN THEIR TIME,
OF COURSE.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.125
ANYWAY, WE OPENED UP
FOR THEM A COUPLE
WEEKS AGO,

04:57.125 --> 04:58.500
AND NOW LLOYD IS
DATING NATASHA,
THEIR DRUMMER,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.458
AND THEY WANT US TO
GO ON TOUR WITH THEM.

05:00.458 --> 05:03.458
A REAL TOUR?

05:03.458 --> 05:05.625
YES! I MEAN,
NOTHING TOO FANCY.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.166
WE'RE JUST BASIC
INDIE-ROCK, DIY THING,
YOU KNOW,

05:08.166 --> 05:09.625
AND 10 CITIES
IN A VAN--

05:09.625 --> 05:11.875
I MEAN, THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR.

05:11.875 --> 05:14.708
CHARLIE, THAT'S AMAZING!
CONGRATULATIONS!

05:14.708 --> 05:16.000
THANK YOU.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.250
SO, WHEN DO YOU
GUYS GO? THIS SUMMER?

05:18.250 --> 05:21.250
NO. ACTUALLY, WE HIT
THE ROAD MONDAY.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.959
BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE SEMESTER.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.792
WELL, SURE, YEAH,
BUT, I MEAN, THE
REST OF THE GUYS,

05:24.792 --> 05:25.875
THEY'RE NOT EVEN
IN COLLEGE,

05:25.875 --> 05:27.125
AND THE WAY I
SEE IT, I MEAN,

05:27.125 --> 05:28.417
I THINK I CAN
PUT IN A FEW
INCOMPLETES,

05:28.417 --> 05:30.834
MAKE UP STUFF NEXT
YEAR, I MEAN, UNLESS
WE HIT IT BIG.

05:30.834 --> 05:33.625
WELL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'VE GOT
IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.834
ALMOST.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.917
I THINK YOU SHOULD
COME WITH ME.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.166
CHARLIE, YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.667
YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME
TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL
AND GO ON TOUR WITH YOU?

05:45.667 --> 05:49.542
I MEAN, THIS IS MY LIFE--
WORTHINGTON COLLEGE.

05:49.542 --> 05:51.083
I LOVE IT HERE.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.792
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU THINK I
SHOULDN'T GO?

05:52.792 --> 05:57.333
NO, I'M SAYING THAT
I DON'T THINK THAT
I SHOULD GO.

05:57.333 --> 06:00.166
RIGHT. OK, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

06:00.166 --> 06:01.333
I KNOW
I'M NOT BEING FAIR.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.917
IT'S JUST THAT THIS
THING BETWEEN US--

06:04.917 --> 06:06.208
WE JUST
GOT IT STARTED,

06:06.208 --> 06:08.458
AND IT TOOK ME
A REALLY LONG TIME

06:08.458 --> 06:10.125
TO GET YOU TO EVEN
CONSIDER ME

06:10.125 --> 06:12.500
AS A PROSPECT.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.291
I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

06:16.291 --> 06:19.875
JUST THAT I DON'T
WANT...

06:19.875 --> 06:21.583
THIS TO END JUST YET.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.959
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING RIGHT
THIS SECOND, ARE YOU?

06:26.959 --> 06:28.625
NO.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.458
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.208
ALL RIGHT. SO,
AT THE TOP,

06:34.208 --> 06:35.708
OBVIOUSLY, WE APOLOGIZE
FOR RESCHEDULING,

06:35.708 --> 06:37.375
AND THEN I SAY WE GET
RIGHT TO TALKING ABOUT
THE MOVIE, ALL RIGHT?

06:37.375 --> 06:40.041
HOW WE MADE IT,
HOW MUCH IT COST--

06:40.041 --> 06:42.208
WHATEVER, BUT IF
YOU LET ME DO MOST
OF THE TALKING,

06:42.208 --> 06:44.708
I THINK YOU'LL
FIND THE WHOLE THING
GOES OVER MUCH BETTER.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.041
WHY?

06:46.041 --> 06:48.917
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS,
DAWSON,

06:48.917 --> 06:50.625
BUT YOU'RE A LITTLE DRY.

06:50.625 --> 06:53.542
I MEAN, CAMERA ANGLE
THIS, LIGHTING THE SHOT
THAT...

06:53.542 --> 06:55.041
TRUST ME.
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

06:55.041 --> 06:57.125
I SHINE IN MEETINGS.
YOU'VE HAD MEETINGS?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.583
WELL, YOU KNOW,
PRACTICE MEETINGS...

06:59.583 --> 07:01.375
WITH FAMILY MEMBERS.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.208
GREAT.

07:03.208 --> 07:05.959
WOULD YOU STOP
WORRYING SO MUCH?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.291
OLIVER, HOW MANY AGENTS
DID WE SEND THIS MOVIE TO?

07:07.291 --> 07:08.291
50.

07:08.291 --> 07:09.417
60.

07:09.417 --> 07:10.250
HOW MANY ACTUALLY
ANSWERED OUR LETTER?

07:10.250 --> 07:11.750
ONE, BUT TRUST ME.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.333
WE GOT NO WORRIES HERE.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.875
YOU'RE
A TERRIFIC DIRECTOR,

07:14.875 --> 07:16.625
AND I'M
A PHENOMENAL WRITER.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.583
AFTER TODAY,
WHEN SOMEONE ASKS US,

07:18.583 --> 07:19.542
DO YOU 2 GENTLEMEN
HAVE REPRESENTATION,

07:19.542 --> 07:23.166
WE CAN SAY, WHY, YES.
YES, WE DO.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.333
PLENTY PEOPLE
ARE TALENTED, OLIVER.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.083
NOT ALL OF THEM
HAVE AGENTS.
THAT'S TRUE,

07:25.083 --> 07:27.250
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

07:27.250 --> 07:29.417
BECAUSE IT'S ALL
ABOUT PRESENTATION.

07:29.417 --> 07:30.333
WE GO IN THERE
LOOKING LIKE
A MILLION BUCKS,

07:30.333 --> 07:32.834
WHO'S GONNA
TURN US DOWN?

07:33.834 --> 07:34.250
HUH?

07:34.250 --> 07:36.250
[SIGHS]

07:36.250 --> 07:37.417
I KNOW I'M GONNA
REGRET ASKING THIS,

07:37.417 --> 07:39.458
BUT HOW EXACTLY
DO I DO THAT?

07:39.458 --> 07:42.625
OK. YOU SEE
THE MOVIE RAIN MAN?

07:42.625 --> 07:44.375
YEAH.
WELL,

07:44.375 --> 07:45.125
REMEMBER WHEN
THEY'RE COMING DOWN
THE ESCALATOR

07:45.125 --> 07:47.417
IN VEGAS? RIGHT?

07:47.417 --> 07:48.208
THIS ISN'T GOING WHERE
I THINK IT'S GOING, IS IT?

07:48.208 --> 07:49.000
THAT WAS
A KICK-ASS ENTRANCE!

07:49.000 --> 07:50.959
OLIVER, NO!

07:50.959 --> 07:52.125
HOW GREAT WOULD
THAT GO OVER?

07:52.125 --> 07:53.583
WE'D LOOK LIKE
THE ULTIMATE TEAM.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.625
WE'RE NOT GONNA GO
TO THIS MEETING
WEARING MATCHING SUITS.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.792
HOW ABOUT JUST
MATCHING SHIRTS, HUH?

08:00.208 --> 08:02.500
COME ON! WE'D LOOK
LIKE SIEGFRIED AND ROY!

08:02.500 --> 08:03.917
OH!

08:03.917 --> 08:06.959
SO, WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME JUST
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.125
HE WAITED FOR YOU
AFTER CLASS,

08:09.125 --> 08:10.625
AND THEN HE ASKED YOU
TO GO WITH HIM?

08:10.625 --> 08:12.458
YES.
ON TOUR?

08:12.458 --> 08:14.291
YES.
TO SING, RIGHT?

08:14.291 --> 08:17.458
NO. TO BE
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.000
OH! CHARLIE?
CHARLIE TODD?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.500
THE BOY WHO'LL BREAK
YOUR HEART AND THEN
START IN ON YOUR SISTER?

08:23.500 --> 08:26.750
YES, THE ROGUISHLY
HANDSOME BAD-BOY WE'VE
GROWN TO KNOW AND LOVE:

08:26.750 --> 08:28.208
GONE, VANISHED.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.625
ELVIS HAS LEFT
THE BUILDING.

08:29.625 --> 08:32.125
YES. WELL,
NO, HE HASN'T.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.082
HE'S ACTUALLY
DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT NOW

08:33.082 --> 08:35.207
BUYING SNACKS FROM
THE VENDING MACHINE.

08:35.207 --> 08:36.917
HE'S HERE? NOW?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.542
HE WANTS TO SPEND AS MUCH
TIME TOGETHER AS POSSIBLE
BEFORE HE LEAVES.

08:39.542 --> 08:43.000
OH, SO,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

08:43.000 --> 08:47.500
AUDREY, MANY LEVELS HAVE
BEEN SKIPPED HERE--
MANY, MANY LEVELS.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.208
YEAH, BUT IT IS
KIND OF ROMANTIC,
ISN'T IT?

08:50.208 --> 08:52.500
I MEAN, THIS BOY
DRIVES HALFWAY
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

08:52.500 --> 08:53.875
TO SWEEP YOU
OFF YOUR FEET,

08:53.875 --> 08:56.166
AND NOW HE WANTS
YOU TO JOIN HIM
ON THE OPEN ROAD

08:56.166 --> 08:57.375
FOR SOME GREAT
ADVENTURE?

08:57.375 --> 08:58.417
IT'S NOT ROMANTIC,
AUDREY.

08:58.417 --> 09:00.542
IT'S FRIGHTENING,
AND IT'S GETTING WORSE.

09:00.542 --> 09:01.792
HOW MUCH WORSE?
WELL, WHEN HE FOUND OUT

09:01.792 --> 09:04.625
I WASN'T REALLY UP FOR
THE MISSION OF MADNESS,

09:04.625 --> 09:07.208
HE STARTED TO TALK
ABOUT STAYING.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.041
I BELIEVE THE WORD "US"
MAY HAVE EVEN BEEN USED.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.041
OH, YIKES! MORE LEVELS.

09:11.041 --> 09:14.208
ALL RIGHT, BUT HE'S
NOT GOING TO, THOUGH,
RIGHT? STAY, I MEAN.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.375
WELL, NO, BUT--

09:16.375 --> 09:17.750
SO, CHILL OUT!

09:17.750 --> 09:19.083
I'M SURE YOU'RE JUST
OVERREACTING A LITTLE.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.792
BESIDES, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN

09:21.792 --> 09:23.875
IS THAT YOU HURT HIS
FEELINGS A LITTLE BIT.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.708
WOW! BONUS! WHO KNEW
THAT CHARLIE TODD
HAD ANY FEELINGS?

09:26.708 --> 09:30.166
OH, MY GOD.
I'VE GOT TO GO.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.375
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
PACEY OUTSIDE.

09:31.375 --> 09:34.041
WE HAVE TO GO MEET
THE NEW MANAGER OF
CIVILIZATION.

09:34.041 --> 09:34.917
NEW MANAGER?

09:34.917 --> 09:36.667
YEAH. I'LL
WRITE YOU A MEMO.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.208
HELLO, AUDREY.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.834
BYE, CHARLIE.

09:56.959 --> 09:59.083
I HOPE THIS THING
IS OVER QUICKLY.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.291
OH, AND LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.500
IF THERE'S
FLAIR INVOLVED,

10:01.500 --> 10:02.583
I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW I'M QUITTING.

10:02.583 --> 10:03.250
DID YOU GET AHOLD
OF DANNY YET?

10:03.250 --> 10:04.917
NO, I DIDN'T,

10:04.917 --> 10:07.417
AND THE MESSAGE ON HIS
HOME ANSWERING MACHINE

10:07.417 --> 10:08.583
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
NEW YORK FOR THE WEEKEND,

10:08.583 --> 10:10.750
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S GONNA BE.
OH, GOD.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.375
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.

10:14.375 --> 10:17.250
CAN I GET
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.208
IF EVERYONE'S HERE,
I GUESS WE'LL GET STARTED.

10:20.208 --> 10:23.417
I'M ALEX PEARL, AND AS
I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD,

10:23.417 --> 10:25.500
CIVILIZATION
WAS SOLD LAST WEEK.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.792
NOW, THE OLD OWNERS
AND THE OLD CHEF

10:26.792 --> 10:29.000
HAVE ALREADY MOVED ON
TO NEW PROSPECTS,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.417
BUT THEY'VE BUILT
SOMETHING HERE
SO SUCCESSFUL

10:33.417 --> 10:35.583
THAT THE NEW OWNERS ARE
LOOKING TO EXPAND IT

10:35.583 --> 10:37.583
INTO A SERIES
OF RESTAURANTS.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.500
YOU MEAN A CHAIN.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.959
MORE LIKE MULTIPLE
LOCATIONS WITH SIMILAR
ATMOSPHERE AND MENU.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.375
DO YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

10:45.375 --> 10:46.959
NO, NO. [LAUGHS]

10:46.959 --> 10:49.792
I JUST HAVE
A LITTLE PROBLEM

10:49.792 --> 10:51.667
WITH PEOPLE BEING
FORCED OUT OF THINGS

10:51.667 --> 10:53.708
THAT THEY BUILT WITH
THEIR OWN 2 HANDS.

10:53.708 --> 10:54.750
WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT NOBODY WALKED AWAY

10:54.750 --> 10:57.542
FROM THIS DEAL
POVERTY-STRICKEN.

10:57.542 --> 11:00.708
AFTER ALL, THAT IS WHY
PEOPLE GET INTO
THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.

11:00.708 --> 11:01.959
WHY? TO MAKE MONEY?

11:01.959 --> 11:04.250
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL
HERE, ISN'T IT?

11:05.750 --> 11:07.792
NOW, AS MANAGER
OF THIS LOCATION,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.000
I'LL BE INSTITUTING
A LOT OF CHANGES,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.333
NOT ONLY IN POLICY,
BUT ALSO IN STAFF.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.291
INVARIABLY, SOME OF
YOU WILL BE LET GO.

11:14.291 --> 11:17.166
SOME OF US?

11:17.166 --> 11:19.667
YEAH, I'M SORRY, BUT
HAVE YOU BEEN ELECTED

11:19.667 --> 11:21.500
TO SPEAK FOR
THE ENTIRE STAFF?

11:21.500 --> 11:23.333
OH, NO. I APOLOGIZE.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.083
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
WE HAD TO BE ALLOWED
TO SPEAK.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.083
YOU WILL BE,
INDIVIDUALLY.

11:28.959 --> 11:31.250
OVER THE COURSE
OF THE EVENING,

11:31.250 --> 11:32.375
I'LL BE SPEAKING
WITH EACH OF YOU

11:32.375 --> 11:34.000
ABOUT YOUR
EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.125
NOW, IN THE MEANTIME,

11:36.125 --> 11:38.834
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL
TAKE ANY FREE TIME
THAT YOU HAVE

11:38.834 --> 11:41.458
TO FAMILIARIZE
YOURSELF WITH OUR
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.166
THAT SOUND
YOU JUST HEARD?

11:43.166 --> 11:44.417
THAT WAS ALL THE FUN
LEAVING THE BUILDING,
PACEY.

11:44.417 --> 11:48.500
AS FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO WILL BE LET GO,
I APOLOGIZE.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.917
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.875
IT'S JUST THAT SOME
PERSONALITIES DON'T MESH.

11:53.875 --> 11:55.500
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.
THANK YOU.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.208
[EMPLOYEES TALKING QUIETLY]

11:57.208 --> 11:59.542
HELLO.

12:00.834 --> 12:04.125
OK, IT'S OFFICIAL.
SHE'S THE DEVIL.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.625
RELAX, WILL YOU?
WE DON'T KNOW HOW BAD
THIS IS YET.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.708
WELL, YOU BETTER HOPE
IT DOESN'T GET TOO BAD,

12:08.708 --> 12:10.208
MR. I'VE-BEEN-ELECTED-
TO-SPEAK-FOR-THE-STAFF,

12:10.208 --> 12:12.291
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
MAKE THE MOST STELLAR
FIRST IMPRESSION.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.583
WHY DON'T WE JUST GET
THROUGH THE DINNER RUSH,

12:13.583 --> 12:15.041
AND WE CAN COMPARE
NOTES LATER, OK?

12:15.041 --> 12:16.959
OK.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.125
OK.

12:19.166 --> 12:20.208
THANK YOU.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.291
PACEY?

12:21.291 --> 12:23.792
PACEY WITTER?

12:23.792 --> 12:25.000
YEAH?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.542
I'M ALEX PEARL.

12:26.542 --> 12:27.708
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:27.708 --> 12:28.708
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I APOLOGIZE

12:28.708 --> 12:30.542
IF I SEEMED
HARSH BACK THERE.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.959
I WOULD
HATE TO SEEM

12:31.959 --> 12:35.041
AS IF I
DON'T WELCOME
EMPLOYEE FEEDBACK.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.000
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.041
YOU'RE FIRST
ON MY LIST,

12:37.041 --> 12:38.583
IF YOU COULD FOLLOW
ME TO MY OFFICE.

12:38.583 --> 12:39.500
SURE.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.291
GREAT. COME ON.

12:51.375 --> 12:54.458
SMILE, PACEY.
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.375
WELL, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.959
YOU'RE NOT ABOUT
TO LOSE YOUR JOB.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.500
YOU DON'T LIKE
AUTHORITY MUCH, DO YA?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.750
NOT REALLY, NO.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.000
BUT YOU LIKED
DANNY BRECHER?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.166
WELL, THE MAN TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.750
INCLUDING YOUR ATTITUDE?

13:07.750 --> 13:09.458
MOST ESPECIALLY
MY ATTITUDE.

13:09.458 --> 13:12.375
SO I'VE HEARD.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.333
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE
FIRING ME NOW?

13:15.333 --> 13:16.291
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

13:16.291 --> 13:18.792
NO.

13:18.792 --> 13:22.125
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I NEED THIS JOB,
AND I WANT TO STAY.

13:22.125 --> 13:26.708
GOOD. BECAUSE
IT WAS MY PLAN
TO PROMOTE YOU.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.917
I NEED SOMEONE WITH
LEADERSHIP ABILITIES
IN THE KITCHEN,

13:31.917 --> 13:34.750
AT LEAST UNTIL I HIRE
SOMEONE PERMANENT,
OF COURSE.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.959
ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?

13:36.959 --> 13:39.291
DO I LOOK SERIOUS?

13:39.291 --> 13:40.625
YES, YOU DO.

13:40.625 --> 13:44.125
HONESTLY, DON'T
YOU THINK THAT I'M
A LITTLE INEXPERIENCED

13:44.125 --> 13:45.500
FOR THAT KIND
OF RESPONSIBILITY?

13:45.500 --> 13:48.542
OH, ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS MAINTAIN
THE STATUS QUO, PACEY.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.500
LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T
HANDLE IT,

13:51.500 --> 13:52.250
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE
THAT I COULD ASK.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.583
NO, NO.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.166
OVERCONFIDENT.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.125
I LIKE THAT.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.708
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU BETTER GET TO WORK?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.834
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

14:03.834 --> 14:04.667
AND THANK YOU.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.750
AND YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:07.708 --> 14:09.375
OK.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.041
YOU ARE COMING TO
THE SHOW TONIGHT, RIGHT?

14:21.041 --> 14:23.125
OF COURSE. I WOULDN'T
MISS YOUR FAREWELL
TO BOSTON.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.417
[SIGHS] LISTEN.

14:27.417 --> 14:30.333
WILL YOU STOP STUDYING
FOR A SECOND?

14:30.333 --> 14:33.333
OK.

14:33.333 --> 14:37.625
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING, RIGHT?

14:37.625 --> 14:38.625
AND YOU KNOW
THE PART WHERE

14:38.625 --> 14:41.000
I CAME AND TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT THE TOUR?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.500
YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T
GO EXACTLY THE WAY
I PLANNED.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
YEAH. IT WAS
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.625
YEAH, AND...

14:49.625 --> 14:53.583
AND I WAS THINKING THAT...

14:53.583 --> 14:55.500
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T GO.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.333
YOU MEAN, NOT GO
ON THE TOUR?

14:58.333 --> 14:59.917
I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:59.917 --> 15:01.583
YOU KNOW, SCHOOL IS
IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW?

15:01.583 --> 15:03.792
MAYBE IT'S NOT
IMPORTANT TO ME,

15:03.792 --> 15:06.375
BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THEORY,
SCHOOL'S IMPORTANT,

15:06.375 --> 15:08.542
YOU KNOW,
BUT IT CAN WAIT.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.542
I MEAN, I ALREADY GOT
ONE OPPORTUNITY,

15:10.542 --> 15:12.500
AND OTHERS ARE
BOUND TO HAPPEN.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.458
AND UNTIL THEN...

15:22.458 --> 15:23.834
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

15:23.834 --> 15:27.625
I MEAN, HELL, WE CAN
START OUR OWN BAND,
RIGHT? YOU AND ME.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.625
CHARLIE, I CAN'T--

15:36.583 --> 15:39.750
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA ANYMORE.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.583
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE
YOUR DOUBTS ABOUT ME,

15:41.583 --> 15:44.542
JOEY POTTER.
HEY, AND YOU SHOULD!

15:44.542 --> 15:47.375
HELL, SOME DAYS I HAVE
MY OWN DOUBTS ABOUT ME,

15:47.375 --> 15:50.917
BUT...IT'S NOT TOO LATE

15:50.917 --> 15:54.000
FOR ME TO PROVE THAT I CAN
BE A PERSON OF SUBSTANCE.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.083
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU
PROVING TO BE AN--

16:03.041 --> 16:06.834
WE ARE GOING TO BE GREAT
TOGETHER, JOEY.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.875
YOU AND ME.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.166
I KNOW THIS IS
THE RIGHT DECISION.

16:11.166 --> 16:14.041
WE'LL TALK MORE LATER.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.417
ALL RIGHT, THIS
IS OUR LAST CHANCE

16:36.417 --> 16:38.458
TO GO OVER ANY STRATEGY
BEFORE WE GET IN THERE.

16:38.458 --> 16:42.125
THIS GUY'S GONNA KEEP US WAITING
AT LEAST ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.917
IT'S A POWER THING.
HE'S PLAYING GAMES WITH US.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.542
OR HE'S ACTUALLY BUSY.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.625
WHOA.
WHAT?

16:50.625 --> 16:52.041
DID YOU SEE THAT?
WHAT?

16:52.041 --> 16:54.166
THE RECEPTIONIST. I THINK
SHE JUST CHECKED ME OUT.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.542
SHE'S NOT EVEN
LOOKING OVER HERE.

16:59.542 --> 17:03.083
OH, BUT SHE WAS. THINK
I SHOULD ASK HER OUT?

17:03.083 --> 17:04.165
NO.

17:04.165 --> 17:06.583
YEAH, IT'S THE WHOLE
LONG-DISTANCE THING.

17:06.583 --> 17:07.834
SHE LIVES IN NEW YORK,
I LIVE IN BOSTON.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.500
RIGHT. EXACTLY.
THAT'S IT.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.375
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF SHE'S
WILLING TO GO FOR IT,

17:14.375 --> 17:16.541
IT MIGHT WORK OUT.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.208
OK, MAYBE ON MY WAY OUT.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.165
SHE LOOKS BUSY NOW.

17:26.165 --> 17:30.125
YES. PULP FICTION II.

17:35.375 --> 17:36.667
HOW'D IT GO?
NOT SO BAD, HUH?

17:36.667 --> 17:38.708
WORSE.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.750
OH, COME ON. THE WOMAN
IS NOT THE DEVIL.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.375
SHE'S JUST PUTTING UP
A TOUGH FRONT
TO INTIMIDATE US,

17:43.375 --> 17:44.875
TRYING TO MAKE US
RESPECT HER.

17:44.875 --> 17:46.125
I BET 10-1
IT WILL NOT LAST.

17:46.125 --> 17:49.125
OK, WELL, YOU CAN LET ME KNOW
HOW IT ALL TURNS OUT, OK?

17:49.125 --> 17:50.583
I GUARANTEE, YOU'LL WANNA
SEE IT FOR YOURSELF.

17:50.583 --> 17:51.750
NO, ACTUALLY, I WON'T

17:51.750 --> 17:55.000
BECAUSE I'M NO LONGER
AN EMPLOYEE OF CIVILIZATION.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.250
YOU QUIT?

17:56.250 --> 17:59.208
NO. WENCH FIRED ME.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.625
SHE DID WHAT?

18:00.625 --> 18:03.542
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE ME
SAY IT AGAIN?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.458
I'M SORRY. THIS IS NOT
A BIG DEAL, OK?

18:05.458 --> 18:08.750
IN FACT, IT'S AN EASY FIX,
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME,

18:08.750 --> 18:10.750
TAKE THE NIGHT OFF
AND RELAX,

18:10.750 --> 18:11.708
AND I WILL TALK TO HER.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.500
WHAT GOOD
IS THAT GONNA DO?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.083
WELL, IT CAN'T HURT, RIGHT?

18:15.083 --> 18:17.083
I'M WILLING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB
AND BE OPTIMISTIC HERE

18:17.083 --> 18:19.708
AND TELL YOU THAT
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU WILL
HAVE YOUR JOB BACK

18:19.708 --> 18:20.959
BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.375
YOU PROMISE?

18:23.375 --> 18:24.458
I PROMISE.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.792
OK.

18:28.917 --> 18:31.000
YEAH, SO SCREW 'EM
IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.834
SORRY ABOUT KEEPING
YOU GUYS WAITING ALL DAY.

18:34.834 --> 18:36.917
ANDREW WALLER.

18:36.917 --> 18:37.583
DAWSON LEERY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.500
WE'RE THRILLED TO BE HERE.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.959
THIRST FOR VENGEANCE?

18:41.959 --> 18:42.917
YOU WEREN'T RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT WERE YOU?

18:42.917 --> 18:44.417
WE PACKAGED IT, YES.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.458
WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT THAT MOVIE
ON THE WAY DOWN, ACTUALLY.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.625
THAT WAS AN INTERESTING
CHOICE TO HAVE HIM
DIRECT THAT MOVIE.

18:51.625 --> 18:52.625
YEAH, BUT THAT SCRIPT,

18:52.625 --> 18:56.625
BAZOOKA COMICS HAVE MORE
DEPTH THAN THAT.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.792
MUST BE THE WRITER.

18:58.792 --> 19:03.166
YEAH...WE BOTH ARE,
ACTUALLY,

19:03.166 --> 19:05.500
WHICH IS WHAT KIND OF WHAT
MAKES US SUCH A GOOD TEAM,

19:05.500 --> 19:08.333
'CAUSE OLIVER, IN ADDITION
TO KNOWING WHAT HE LIKES,

19:08.333 --> 19:09.083
ALSO HAS THE ABILITY
TO THINK BIG,

19:09.083 --> 19:12.250
IN ALMOST OPERATIC TERMS.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.208
AND YOU REIN HIM IN?

19:13.208 --> 19:15.458
RIGHT. YEAH. AS A DIRECTOR,

19:15.458 --> 19:16.750
I'VE LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES
YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK IN TERMS

19:16.750 --> 19:17.792
OF WHAT'S
LOGISTICALLY POSSIBLE.

19:17.792 --> 19:19.458
OTHERWISE, YOU WON'T
GET ANYTHING ON FILM.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.583
AND YOU DID SOMETHING

19:21.583 --> 19:23.291
FAR BEYOND THE USUAL
STUDENT FILM,

19:23.291 --> 19:25.625
AND BELIEVE ME,
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THEM.

19:25.625 --> 19:26.959
THANK YOU.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.583
SO, WHAT I WANTED
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU--

19:29.583 --> 19:31.625
UM, CAN I INTERRUPT
FOR A MOMENT?

19:31.625 --> 19:33.250
SURE.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.667
BECAUSE WE DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.417
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE A COUPLE
MORE MEETINGS TODAY.

19:37.417 --> 19:39.583
MOSTLY PRODUCTION COMPANIES,

19:39.583 --> 19:41.959
MORE ON THE EDGIER,
INDIE SIDE.

19:41.959 --> 19:44.166
NOT THAT WE'RE
OPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW,

19:44.166 --> 19:47.250
COMPROMISING
OUR ARTISTIC INTEGRITY
TO EARN A COUPLE BUCKS.

19:49.667 --> 19:55.000
THE POINT IS, WHAT IS IT
THAT HOLLYWOOD IS ALWAYS
LOOKING FOR,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.041
BUT NEVER SEEMS TO FIND
ENOUGH OF?

19:56.041 --> 19:59.000
IS THIS A RIDDLE
OR SOMETHING?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.625
DON'T WORRY. I GOT THIS.

20:01.625 --> 20:04.917
YOUNG TALENT!
HEH HEH.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.250
AND THAT, MY FRIEND, IS WHAT
ME AND MY PARTNER ARE--

20:06.250 --> 20:08.834
WE ARE YOUNG,
AND WE'RE TALENTED.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.875
I WOULD AGREE ON BOTH COUNTS,

20:10.875 --> 20:13.458
WHICH IS WHY I ASKED YOU
TO COME MEET WITH ME.

20:13.458 --> 20:14.667
SO LET'S CUT TO
THE CHASE, SHALL WE?

20:14.667 --> 20:17.708
OR WE COULD JUST LISTEN
TO WHAT THE MAN HAS TO SAY.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.000
WHERE DOES THAT TERM
COME FROM, ANYWAY?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.375
"CUT TO THE CHASE."
IT'S A HOLLYWOOD TERM.

20:21.375 --> 20:25.542
NO ONE WANTED TO
JUST SIT THROUGH
BORING HOURS OF NARRATIVE.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.542
THEY WANTED TO GET RIGHT TO
THE EXCITING CHASE SEQUENCE.

20:27.542 --> 20:28.542
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

20:28.542 --> 20:30.417
I BELIEVE IT IS, YEAH.

20:30.417 --> 20:33.458
THUS...CUT TO THE CHASE.

20:36.792 --> 20:39.375
OK, THAT ENDS ANOTHER
FASCINATING EDITION

20:39.375 --> 20:40.750
OF "ANATOMY OF A PHRASE."

20:40.750 --> 20:44.166
IS HE...OK?

20:45.333 --> 20:47.875
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU
MEAN BY THAT TERM.

20:47.875 --> 20:51.417
I'M JUST SORT
OF WONDERING IF HE'S
ON SOME KIND OF DRUGS.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.417
HA!

20:54.458 --> 20:56.583
NO. HE'S JUST ECCENTRIC.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.750
MR. WALLER, WE DON'T MEAN
TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

20:58.750 --> 21:02.458
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

21:02.458 --> 21:05.375
OLIVER. DAWSON.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.333
NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.375
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

21:14.959 --> 21:16.875
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.750
I TOLD YOU THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN, AUDREY.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.625
YOU SAID I WAS OVERREACTING,
BUT I WASN'T, WAS I?

21:23.625 --> 21:25.834
YOU ARE STILL COMING
WITH ME TONIGHT, RIGHT?

21:25.834 --> 21:27.250
MAKE IT SEEM
LESS LIKE A DATE?

21:27.250 --> 21:29.250
YEAH, SURE. NOW THAT I'M FIRED,
WHAT ELSE HAVE I GOT TO DO?

21:29.250 --> 21:31.166
IT'S OFFICIAL.
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.291
YOU ARE SO NOT
A HORRIBLE PERSON.

21:33.291 --> 21:36.417
I AM. I'M THE WORST
KIND OF PERSON

21:36.417 --> 21:38.583
BECAUSE I SUCK THESE BOYS
INTO MY WEB,

21:38.583 --> 21:41.083
AND THEN I MAKE THEM
GIVE UP THEIR DREAMS

21:41.083 --> 21:43.291
UNTIL THEY'RE LEFT
SAD AND DREAMLESS

21:43.291 --> 21:44.458
AND LIVING IN BOSTON.

21:44.458 --> 21:48.667
YEAH, WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DREAMS?

21:48.667 --> 21:51.166
I HAVE MY DREAM.
THIS IS IT.

21:51.166 --> 21:54.291
WELL, YOU NEED TO DREAM BIGGER.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.083
AUDREY...

21:56.083 --> 21:59.750
RIGHT.
OK. FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED
TO STOP IT WITH THE CIRCLES

21:59.750 --> 22:01.000
'CAUSE YOU'RE
MAKING ME NAUSEOUS.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.125
AND SECONDLY, IF YOU FELT
THIS STRONGLY ABOUT IT,

22:04.125 --> 22:06.625
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL
CHARLIE TO GO ON THE TOUR?

22:06.625 --> 22:07.667
I TRIED.

22:07.667 --> 22:11.917
BUT HE DROPPED THIS
BOMBSHELL AND THEN LEFT.

22:11.917 --> 22:14.917
I SUPPOSE THERE WAS
KISSING INVOLVED.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.000
I SUPPOSE.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.125
OK. WELL, I GET IT.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.417
GET WHAT?

22:20.417 --> 22:21.834
THE PROBLEM.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.125
FACE IT, IT'D BE HARD
FOR ANY GIRL

22:24.125 --> 22:26.500
TO LOOK INTO THOSE ROCK-HARD ABS
AND SAY, "CHARLIE, I'M SORRY.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.834
"THINK YOU COULD JUST
GET THE HELL OUT OF TOWN

22:28.834 --> 22:30.667
AND NEVER CALL ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?"

22:30.667 --> 22:31.750
AUDREY, THAT'S NOT IT.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.500
I DON'T WANT TO HURT
HIS FEELINGS.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.583
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU
TELL SOMEONE WHO'S
OBVIOUSLY INTO YOU

22:37.583 --> 22:38.667
THAT YOU'RE NOT...

22:38.667 --> 22:40.000
INTO THEM?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.500
I'M NOT READY TO BE
ANYONE'S GIRLFRIEND,

22:42.500 --> 22:44.750
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT ANYONE TO CHANGE
THEIR LIFE FOR ME.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.542
YOU'RE SURE
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING?

22:46.542 --> 22:49.333
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO
PROVE TO ME THAT HE CAN
BE A PERSON OF SUBSTANCE.

22:49.333 --> 22:53.667
OH. THIS IS MUCH WORSE
THAN I'D IMAGINED.

23:02.417 --> 23:04.375
APOLOGIZE
FOR THE MISTAKE

23:04.375 --> 23:07.041
AND OFFER A DESSERT
WITH OUR COMPLIMENTS.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.625
OK, WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

23:09.625 --> 23:12.625
WE'VE GOT 3 TABLES
WAITING FOR THEIR FOOD.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.917
THIS IS REALLY
NOT A GREAT PLACE FOR YOU
TO BE STANDING.

23:13.917 --> 23:15.208
IT'S KIND OF
A HIGH-TRAFFIC AREA,

23:15.208 --> 23:16.458
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH...

23:16.458 --> 23:18.667
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW MANY LOBSTERS
WE SERVE TONIGHT.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.375
I THINK WE'RE ORDERING
TOO MANY FROM THE VENDOR.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.625
WE ARE, BUT DANNY HAS A DEAL
WITH THE GUY, SO IT'S--

23:21.625 --> 23:22.542
AH, AH. CHANGES, PACEY.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.750
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
ABOUT CHANGES.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.708
ACTUALLY, IT'S FUNNY THAT
YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT

23:26.708 --> 23:27.917
BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT I WANNA DISCUSS WITH YOU.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.708
IT'S REGARDING ONE OF
THE WAITRESSES YOU FIRED TODAY.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.583
YES, WELL, I FIRED A LOT
OF WAITRESSES TODAY.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.875
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
REFRESH MY MEMORY.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.834
SHE'S YOUNG
AND BLONDE AND--

23:36.834 --> 23:38.417
OOH, MY FAVORITE
COMBINATION.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.417
LOOK, SHE'S ACTUALLY
A WONDERFUL WAITRESS,

23:40.417 --> 23:41.583
AND IF YOU GAVE HER A CHANCE,
I'M SURE THAT SHE WOULD--

23:41.583 --> 23:45.250
DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
SPECIAL INTEREST IN HER?

23:45.250 --> 23:48.250
WELL, YEAH.
SHE IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.708
OH, WHOA.

23:52.667 --> 23:57.166
UM, THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

23:57.166 --> 23:58.208
FOOD, CUSTOMERS.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.166
OF COURSE NOT. RIGHT.
WORK. I UNDERSTAND.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.542
BUT IF YOU WANNA COME AND SEE ME
LATER, THAT'D BE FINE.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.542
SURE.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.750
OLIVER,
DO ME A FAVOR.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.750
JUST TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT YOU DID IN THERE,

24:13.750 --> 24:16.333
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
LOOK A WHOLE LOT MORE
CHARITABLY ON THIS WHOLE FIASCO

24:16.333 --> 24:17.583
IF YOU JUST PLEAD IGNORANCE.

24:17.583 --> 24:20.667
OK, SO I GOT A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.250
A LITTLE? OLIVER,
YOU'RE ALWAYS DOING THIS.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.667
YOU'RE ALWAYS PRETENDING
THAT WE'RE SOMETHING WE'RE NOT.

24:26.667 --> 24:28.959
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH BEING WHAT WE ARE?
WE'RE AMATEURS.

24:28.959 --> 24:31.583
I WAS JUST TRYING TO KEEP
THE CONVERSATION GOING.

24:31.583 --> 24:34.208
I DIDN'T WANT THERE TO BE
ANY SAD, TERRIFYING SILENCES.

24:34.208 --> 24:37.625
LIKE THE ONE THAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU CALLED THE GUY'S
MOVIE A PIECE OF CRAP?

24:37.625 --> 24:40.625
OK, I COULD'VE BEEN
MORE DIPLOMATIC ABOUT THAT.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.166
NEXT TIME, I PROMISE

24:42.166 --> 24:43.792
THE FULL HOLLYWOOD
BROWN-NOSE TREATMENT.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.500
WHAT NEXT TIME?

24:45.500 --> 24:48.625
OLIVER, THAT GUY'S
NEVER GONNA MEET
WITH US AGAIN.

24:48.625 --> 24:51.959
OK, DAWSON,

24:51.959 --> 24:53.917
A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE,
PLEASE?

24:53.917 --> 24:57.000
ANDREW WALLER IS JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.291
THERE IS A WHOLE WORLD
OF AGENCIES OUT THERE

24:59.291 --> 25:01.208
JUST WAITING TO BE INTRODUCED
TO THE BLINDING BRILLIANCE

25:01.208 --> 25:03.583
OF CHIRCHICK AND LEERY.

25:03.583 --> 25:06.333
NONE OF WHOM RETURNED OUR
LETTERS OR OUR PHONE CALLS.

25:06.333 --> 25:07.750
YEAH, BUT OUR FILM
KICKS SERIOUS ASS,

25:07.750 --> 25:10.250
AND THE NEXT ONE'S
GONNA BE EVEN BETTER.

25:10.250 --> 25:13.250
WE ARE A GREAT TEAM, MAN.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.834
WE'RE LIKE THE COEN BROTHERS
OR THE HUGHES BROTHERS

25:16.834 --> 25:17.792
OR THE WACHOWSKIS.

25:17.792 --> 25:18.667
EXCEPT WE'RE NOT BROTHERS.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.708
YEAH, I MEAN,
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

25:21.708 --> 25:23.208
I'VE NEVER HAD A BROTHER.

25:23.208 --> 25:25.708
WE MADE ONE FILM TOGETHER,
OLIVER. ONE FILM.

25:25.708 --> 25:27.083
AND AFTER TODAY,
I'M STARTING TO THINK

25:27.083 --> 25:29.166
THIS WHOLE PARTNERSHIP
IS JUST A BAD IDEA.

25:32.166 --> 25:35.875
WHAT? YOU WANNA END
THE PARTNERSHIP?

25:35.875 --> 25:38.708
NO. I JUST...

25:40.625 --> 25:44.083
LOOK, I DIDN'T WALK
INTO THIS MEETING

25:44.083 --> 25:46.875
EXPECTING IT TO
BE SOME MIRACLE THAT WOULD
CHANGE MY LIFE FOREVER, OK?

25:46.875 --> 25:48.917
BUT I WANTED IT TO GO
BETTER THAN THAT.

25:48.917 --> 25:52.125
YEAH, SO DID I,
BUT IT DIDN'T.

25:52.125 --> 25:55.583
YOU KNOW, I FIGURE LET'S JUST
GO BACK TO MAKING MOVIES,

25:55.583 --> 25:57.875
AND THEN, WHEN WE GET
ANOTHER CHANCE--

25:57.875 --> 26:00.834
ANOTHER CH--OLIVER,
THIS WAS OUR CHANCE!

26:00.834 --> 26:03.333
THAT WAS OUR CHANCE,
AND WE BLEW IT!

26:03.333 --> 26:07.667
OK! EXCUSE ME FOR TRYING
TO BE A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC

26:07.667 --> 26:10.208
ABOUT OUR FUTURE, YOU KNOW.

26:10.208 --> 26:14.667
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT WAS
THAT YOU SAID ABOUT US
NOT HAVING A FUTURE?

26:14.667 --> 26:16.291
I'M TRYING TO BE
REALISTIC HERE,
AND YOU'RE JUST BEING NAIVE.

26:16.291 --> 26:20.708
NAIVE? I'M NAIVE?

26:22.291 --> 26:25.041
MR. "LET'S DRIVE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO FLORIDA

26:25.041 --> 26:26.542
TO FULFILL
MY ROMANTIC DESTINY"?

26:26.542 --> 26:27.875
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.542
YEAH, YOU BET IT IS.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.667
I'M GONNA TAKE
THE TRAIN BACK.

HOW SETTLED WE ARE.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.125
BUT YOU ARE  TOGETHER?

40:24.125 --> 40:24.959
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

40:24.959 --> 40:26.959
THAT'S ALL I MEAN
BY SETTLING.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.208
A SHAME, REALLY.

40:28.208 --> 40:31.583
THERE ARE
NO ADORABLE SINGLE MEN
LEFT IN THIS TOWN.

40:33.041 --> 40:33.750
GUESS NOT,

40:33.750 --> 40:36.250
BUT, LOOK,
ABOUT AUDREY.

40:36.250 --> 40:40.583
YEAH. I THINK WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO WORK SOMETHING OUT.

40:43.125 --> 40:45.083
GREAT.

40:45.083 --> 40:47.083
I MEAN, WE BOTH WANT
THE SAME THING, DON'T WE?

40:47.083 --> 40:50.458
MM. UM...

40:50.458 --> 40:54.542
NO. I DON'T THINK
THAT WE DO.

40:54.542 --> 40:57.375
I'M SORRY, BUT WE MUST
HAVE GOTTEN OUR WIRES
CROSSED THERE SOMEWHERE.

40:57.375 --> 40:58.417
DID WE?

40:58.417 --> 41:00.583
IT DIDN'T FEEL
THAT WAY TO ME.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.750
YES, WE MOST
DEFINITELY DID.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.917
LOOK, IT'S LATE.
I THINK I SHOULD
BE GOING.

41:04.917 --> 41:06.583
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

41:09.291 --> 41:13.041
I THINK THAT
I SHOULD LEAVE, ALEX.

41:13.041 --> 41:15.083
YOUR DECISION.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.291
HEY, NOT SO FAST,
STRANGER.

41:28.291 --> 41:31.166
HEY, I WAS JUST
HEADING OUT TO GET SOME FOOD.

41:31.166 --> 41:32.583
NO FOOD CHEZ  GRAMS?

41:32.583 --> 41:34.583
MUST BE A SIGN
OF THE APOCALYPSE.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.750
SHE'S A LITTLE PREOCCUPIED.

41:36.750 --> 41:37.750
OH, RIGHT--MR. SMALLS.

41:37.750 --> 41:41.250
GUESS LOVE DOES
FUNNY THINGS TO PEOPLE.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.208
YES, IT DOES.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.834
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU AROUND?

41:44.834 --> 41:47.750
DUH. I CAME BY TO SEE
HOW YOUR MEETING WENT.

41:47.750 --> 41:49.667
RIGHT.

41:49.667 --> 41:51.000
DID IT GO AS WELL
AS YOU HOPED IT WOULD?

41:51.000 --> 41:54.917
LET'S JUST SAY IT STARTED OUT
BADLY, BUT IT ENDED WELL.

41:54.917 --> 41:56.125
HOW WELL?

41:56.125 --> 41:58.542
I THINK I MAY HAVE AN AGENT.

42:00.208 --> 42:00.750
NICE.

42:03.333 --> 42:04.333
BETTER THAN NICE.

42:04.333 --> 42:07.500
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

42:07.500 --> 42:07.834
ALMOST.

42:11.625 --> 42:15.834
THAT FOOD
YOU WERE GOING TO GET

42:15.834 --> 42:18.708
WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE
SOMETHING IN THE PIZZA
FAMILY, WOULD IT?

42:18.708 --> 42:19.834
VAGUELY.

42:19.834 --> 42:22.959
WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO WANT SOME COMPANY?

42:22.959 --> 42:23.708
I WOULD LOVE SOME.

42:27.375 --> 42:29.333
SO WHAT HAPPENED
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS?

42:29.333 --> 42:30.583
I MISS ANYTHING?

42:30.583 --> 42:32.291
UM...THE USUAL.

42:32.291 --> 42:33.291
YOU KNOW,
BROKE A FEW HEARTS,

42:33.291 --> 42:34.708
STARTED
A FEW BARROOM BRAWLS.

42:36.750 --> 42:37.708
THE USUAL...

42:37.708 --> 42:40.458
YEAH, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.
