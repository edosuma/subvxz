00:02.269 --> 00:04.136
- I'm louie's father,
and I want him back.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.371
- The birth parent almost always
wins guardianship.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.739
- I wanted to meet my son.

00:06.741 --> 00:08.240
- You have every right
to meet your son,

00:08.242 --> 00:10.642
but this visit is as far
as it goes.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.678
- He's over an hour late.
- Wouldn't be the first time

00:12.680 --> 00:15.247
I saw someone back out.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.416
- We have a leukemia patient
who's having trouble

00:17.418 --> 00:18.751
<i> finding a genetic match.</i>

00:18.753 --> 00:19.752
- Where do I sign?

00:19.754 --> 00:20.753
- Kelly's your donor.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.087
- Oh, my god.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.222
[both laughing]

00:23.224 --> 00:24.623
- we had to take anna off chemo.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.225
- That's it?
You just let her die?

00:26.227 --> 00:28.127
- I'm sorry, kelly.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.764
- You spent a couple days
in jail,

00:31.766 --> 00:33.732
and now you're
changing your own oil?

00:36.670 --> 00:38.303
- Just keeping busy.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.505
- How's your head?

00:39.507 --> 00:42.441
- Ah, it's fine.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.677
- I heard you stopped by med
the other day to see anna.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.563
- She wouldn't see me.

00:47.564 --> 00:49.448
- No. It was us
that wouldn't let you see her.

00:51.786 --> 00:54.286
At the time, you represented
hope for her, kelly.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.687
- Did something happen?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.489
- No, no, not that.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.792
But yes, something did.
Her neutrophil count

00:59.794 --> 01:01.427
came up overnight,
and we started her

01:01.429 --> 01:03.762
back on chemo this morning.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.465
We want to take another shot
at the bone marrow transplant.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.267
I mean, assuming
we still have a donor.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.368
- Not even a question.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.636
- Yeah, in 24 hours,
we think she'll be

01:10.638 --> 01:12.104
strong enough to do it.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.440
- That's--
that's great news.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.642
[siren blaring]

01:16.644 --> 01:18.177
<i> - truck 81, engine 51.</i>

01:18.179 --> 01:19.445
- All right, buddy.
You go be a hero.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.313
I'm gonna schedule your donation
for tomorrow.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.582
- All right.
<i> - 7110 south st. Lawrence.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:26.718
[sirens blaring]

01:39.867 --> 01:41.867
- help! Please!

01:41.869 --> 01:43.635
Maggie's trapped upstairs!

01:43.637 --> 01:45.270
- Where?
- Up there!

01:46.774 --> 01:48.507
- Severide, squad!
- On it!

01:48.509 --> 01:50.242
- Anybody else up there?
- No.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.511
- Casey, vent the roof.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.214
Buy some time for squad.
Fast but safe.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.515
- Truck,
let's get this roof open.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.749
<i> - Copy that, lieutenant.</i>

01:57.751 --> 01:59.685
- 51, let's get a ladder
in there.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.654
Let's go!

02:02.656 --> 02:05.657
Mouch, get that ladder
up on the roof now!

02:25.579 --> 02:27.379
- Cruz, you stay here.
I'll get her out.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.714
- All right. Got it.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.795
- Fire department! Call out!

02:43.797 --> 02:45.164
<i> - In here!</i>

02:45.166 --> 02:47.499
[loud breathing through mask]

02:47.501 --> 02:49.668
<i> - [coughing]</i>

02:53.240 --> 02:54.740
- give me your hand.
Let's get out of here.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.375
Take my hand.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.676
- [coughing]

02:57.678 --> 02:59.178

02:59.180 --> 03:01.713

03:01.715 --> 03:03.248
- okay, just come out,
all right?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.917
I got you.
I got you. Come on.

03:04.919 --> 03:06.685
Go slow.
Easy.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.620
Easy, that's it.
I got you.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.255
One step at a time.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.690
There you go.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.228
- Hey, chief,
how's that roof vent going?

03:16.230 --> 03:18.597
- We're working on it.
Two minutes.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.533
- That's it.
One step at a time.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.537
[wood creaking]

03:27.808 --> 03:29.541
[explosion]

03:29.543 --> 03:31.243

03:40.621 --> 03:42.788
- Ambo!

03:42.790 --> 03:44.523
Battalion 25 to main.
I need another ambulance

03:44.525 --> 03:45.624
to my location right now!

03:45.626 --> 03:47.509
- Kelly! Kelly?

03:47.510 --> 03:49.393
<i> - Copy that, battalion 25.</i>
<i> Positional ambo en route.</i>

03:49.396 --> 03:52.664
- Kelly!
Kelly.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.367
Kelly, can you hear me?
Kelly!

03:57.404 --> 03:58.937
- Gabby, talk to me.
- He's breathing,

03:58.939 --> 04:00.239
but his pulse is weak
and thready.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.807
We got him.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.419
- 35-year-old male firefighter

04:14.421 --> 04:15.954
jumped from a second-story
window on a call.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.889
Gcs 14,
positive loc,

04:17.891 --> 04:18.924
moving all extremities,

04:18.926 --> 04:19.992
pressure's 90 over 60,

04:19.994 --> 04:20.993
heart rate 100.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.728
16 gauge in both arms.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.863
- We're in this room.
Watch the corner.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.005
On my count. One, two, three.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.976
Get blood. Hang a liter of lr
in the rapid transfuser.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.444
Chest x-ray, then pelvis.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.913
We're gonna roll him.
One, two, three.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.551
Pan scan once we get
his pressure up.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.454
- We got him from here.
Okay?

04:49.456 --> 04:51.023
I'll let you know.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.066
- Hey. How is he?

05:01.068 --> 05:02.934
- Still out.
They gave him pain meds.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.803
They're doing an x-ray and ct.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.941
- So, there is good news.
He's moving his hands and feet,

05:09.943 --> 05:11.543
so we can rule out paralysis.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.012
- What's the bad news?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.915
- There might not be any.
I'll keep you guys posted.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.725
- Okay,
I know we all want to stay,

05:26.727 --> 05:29.795
but there's work to do
out there.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.830
- Understood, chief.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.971
- Chief, he--
he shouldn't wake up alone.

05:41.375 --> 05:45.544
- Okay. I'll tell casey
that you are staying behind.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.746
- Thank you.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.349
I'll call you
as soon as I hear anything.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.883
- Yep.

06:11.438 --> 06:12.704
- How dare you show your face
here?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.439
- Look, it's not what you think.
- Casey.

06:14.441 --> 06:15.707
- No, no, no, no, no.
We're done with you, andre.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.875
You had your chance.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.411
- I understand you're angry.
- Hey! Hey!

06:19.413 --> 06:20.712
We're done.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.749
This is over. Come on.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.951
- But you want to hear this.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.819
Trust me.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.528
I'm redeploying next week.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.430
- What?

06:38.432 --> 06:40.565
- Back to afghanistan.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.505
The day I was supposed
to meet louie, I got the call.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.040
It's a long deployment,

06:49.042 --> 06:52.110
and it could get extended.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.447
I'm here because I wanted
to tell you in person...

06:57.684 --> 06:59.751
That, uh...

06:59.753 --> 07:02.154
I'm signing away
my parental rights.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.960
You two are good for him,
you know, it's--

07:08.962 --> 07:10.829
it's obvious.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.733
- Are you sure about this?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.701
- I--I am.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.908
Take good care of my son.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.776
Please.

07:49.503 --> 07:53.071
- Mm, what took you so long?

07:55.943 --> 07:57.142
- We're at med?

07:57.144 --> 08:00.712
- No. No.
We're at disneyland.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.182
- I need better drugs, then.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.918
- Docs say you got a concussion,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.119
couple bumps and bruises,

08:08.121 --> 08:11.857
but all in all,
you got off pretty easy.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.258
- Doesn't feel like it.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.193
- Well, you could've used
the ladder.

08:15.195 --> 08:19.831
You know, just saved us all
a bunch of stress.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.134
- Next time.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.270
- I'm gonna go get clarke.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.573
He'll want to know you're awake.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.809
- Stella?
- Hm?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.045
- Thank you.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.750
- Okay, some good news.

08:38.752 --> 08:39.918
I have just talked to kidd.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.721
Severide is awake and stable.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.922
- [sighs]
- all right.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.122
[scattered applause]
- concussion, some bruising

08:45.125 --> 08:47.592
on the spine,
but no long-term damage.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.661
He is alert and in good spirits.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.530
- That doesn't sound
like severide.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.599
- He also said do not let capp
sleep in his bed.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.101
- Ah, he sounds fine to me.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.669
- [laughs]

08:59.740 --> 09:01.006
- hey, chief, uh,

09:01.008 --> 09:02.207
I was hoping to run something
by you.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.742
- Yeah. Make it quick.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.877
- Okay, so, the department--
they're sponsoring

09:05.879 --> 09:07.746
a competition to shoot
a new recruitment video.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.915
You know, help educate
the public about what we do,

09:09.917 --> 09:11.850
ways they can help,
maybe join up.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.085
Anyway, so I was hoping
to throw something together

09:14.087 --> 09:15.787
with the guys,

09:15.789 --> 09:18.557
but if now is not
the right time--

09:18.559 --> 09:20.058
- no, no. It's a good idea.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.394
Keep people busy.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.729
- Great. Great. I--I took
this filmmakers' workshop

09:24.731 --> 09:26.731
in high school,
got some great ideas.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.601
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, maybe you would be

09:29.603 --> 09:31.002
interested in a role?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.204
- No way in hell.
- Sure.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.739
Sure. No problem.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.107
Thanks for the support.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.842
- You're welcome.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.279
- Who wants to be a star?

09:47.054 --> 09:50.589
- Ugh. I--

09:50.591 --> 09:53.058
ugh, god.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.259
Don't ask.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.695
- Well, now I have to.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.229
- Promises I'll learn chess
in a week,

09:58.231 --> 10:00.799
but I still can't tell a knight
from a...

10:00.801 --> 10:02.067
Whatever that is.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.268
- You know,
if you're that bored,

10:03.270 --> 10:04.369
there is a sink full of dishes

10:04.371 --> 10:06.121
that aren't gonna wash
themselves.

10:06.122 --> 10:07.872
- No. I just have a friend
who's really into it,

10:07.874 --> 10:10.976
and I'm trying to find
some common ground.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.310
- A friend?
- [sighs]

10:12.312 --> 10:14.112
antonio's son, diego.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.881
The last time we hung out,
he barely said two words to me.

10:16.883 --> 10:21.019
Had his head buried in some
chess app the whole time.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.155
Figure if I learn
about something he's into,

10:24.157 --> 10:26.191
maybe he'll--

10:27.194 --> 10:28.627
- oh, hey, otis,

10:28.629 --> 10:29.928
you got time
for a quick chess lesson?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.296
- Um, have a plan,

10:31.298 --> 10:33.398
control the middle,
protect your king.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.968
- Helpful.
- I am no expert,

10:36.970 --> 10:39.004
but I do know
a few basic strategies.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.039
- You do?
- White goes first,

10:41.041 --> 10:45.143
and I recommend
putting this pawn here.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.079
- You're a lifesaver.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.015
- If you tell squad
I know chess, I'll deny it.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.650
- Noted.

10:54.821 --> 10:55.954
- You look pretty good,

10:55.956 --> 10:57.889
considering you jumped
out a window.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.791
How do you feel?

10:59.793 --> 11:02.727
- Like I...Jumped out a window.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.129
- [laughs]

11:06.900 --> 11:08.767
- what is it?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.435
- What is what?
- You missed the course

11:10.437 --> 11:12.003
in med school
in lying to your patients.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.205
What is it?

11:14.207 --> 11:16.341
- Well, the good news is you're
gonna make a full recovery.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.677
- Bad news?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.912
- The bruising in your pelvis.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.715
It's enough of a problem
that you can't be cleared

11:23.717 --> 11:25.884
for bone marrow donation.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.152
- For how long?

11:27.154 --> 11:31.756
- Your body suffered a trauma.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.058
Look, I talked to everyone,

11:33.059 --> 11:34.359
and the hospital won't allow
the procedure.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.961
- For how long?
- Too long.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.263
Once anna finishes chemo,

11:38.265 --> 11:40.298
she needs the infusion
within a few days.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.867
You won't be ready in time.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.402
Look, man,
we're not giving up.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.337
We're gonna redouble our efforts
to find a match.

11:46.339 --> 11:50.008
You were out there.
Bound to be another.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.210
In the meantime, you just focus
on your recovery, okay?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.913
I'll check on you
in a little bit.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.107
.

12:06.108 --> 12:07.257
- Here, buddy.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.832
- [sighs]

12:15.402 --> 12:17.235
- what is it?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.171
- What if andre doesn't
come back from afghanistan?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.444
What if we're the reason
he never meets louie?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.983
Can we be the ones
to make that call for him?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.204
- Boom.
- What's that?

12:53.206 --> 12:56.174
- Oh, nothing. It's a...

12:56.176 --> 12:58.243
Gopro hero5, the premier tool

12:58.245 --> 12:59.911
for skateboarding auteurs
everywhere.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.046
- I don't think connie's gonna
reimburse us for that.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.081
- Oh, no.
My cousin lent me this.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.215
It's ours the rest of the week.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.784
- Yeah? You got a plan?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.385
- Yeah.
Why fake the drama

13:07.387 --> 13:09.420
when we see the real deal
every day?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.890
- Cinéma vérité.
I like it.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.025
- No. I'm talking
about realism.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.460
- I think that's
what that means.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.328
- Oh, okay, then yeah, that.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.997
We take this along on our calls,
right?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.799
We catch some real fires,
some explosions,

13:20.801 --> 13:22.167
some aerial rescues.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.402
The type of stuff that we do
all the time.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.037
- You know what? You're right.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.872
Who needs some phony
razzle-dazzle?

13:27.874 --> 13:30.141
We walk into burning buildings
for a living.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.276
Let's show them what we got.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.144
- Yeah.

13:36.416 --> 13:42.453
<i> - Neuro consult, bed 5.</i>
<i> Neuro consult, bed 5.</i>

13:43.590 --> 13:45.323
- I can see you.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.192
You know, whoever's out there,

13:47.194 --> 13:49.527
I've got a call button,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.596
[both laugh]

13:51.598 --> 13:54.098
I thought you were all laid up.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.934
- Well...

13:58.071 --> 14:01.906
I'm sore, but I'm fine.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.943
- Mm.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.144
- How you doing?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.647
- Eh, you know,

14:08.648 --> 14:11.149
just fighting cancer
drop by drop.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.319
Clarke told me everything,

14:14.320 --> 14:16.187
so if you're here
to talk about your feelings,

14:16.189 --> 14:19.123
can you please take it
someplace else?

14:19.125 --> 14:23.461
- I'm not much of a "talk
about my feelings" kind of guy.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.598
- Well, I knew I liked you.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.467
- But I just wanted--
- oh! Don't, please!

14:29.469 --> 14:31.569
[both laughing]
- come on.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.378
I'm sorry

14:40.380 --> 14:42.080
that it didn't work out.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.582
I really wanted to help.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.618
- I know.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.087
You know, they're still looking
for another match,

14:49.089 --> 14:51.990
so, I mean, you never know.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.461
- How long did it take you
to find me?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.568
- It's like...

15:03.570 --> 15:05.436
14 months.

15:08.975 --> 15:13.478
But, hey,
maybe my story here's over.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.482
Whatever higher power's
pushing the buttons has a plan,

15:17.484 --> 15:20.084
and I'm really at peace
with that.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.257
- I should've
taken the shift off.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.393
- No, no, don't do that.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.128
Come here.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.199
What happened to that girl
from the fire?

15:35.201 --> 15:37.335
Hm?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.070
She made it, right?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.507
- Yeah.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.343
- There you go.
You're off the hook.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.213
You've already saved a life
this week.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.262
- [sighs]

16:05.231 --> 16:06.965
- hey! There he is.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.767
- Hey!

16:08.768 --> 16:10.568
Maybe don't go missing
from your hospital room.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.136
Let's not do that.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.305
Empty bed sends
the wrong signals.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.573
- I'm fine.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.375
- Hey, buddy.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.144
Only you can jump
out of a window

16:20.146 --> 16:21.679
and live to tell about it.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.214
Nine lives.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.152
- You all right?

16:30.623 --> 16:32.357
What is it?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.094
- [sighs]

16:36.096 --> 16:38.696
clarke says they won't
go through with the donation.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.099
They say there's been
too much trauma.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.769
- But she's--
she started the chemo.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.637
- Yeah.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.240
It's not supposed to happen
this way.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.510
- Sorry, kelly.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.179
- Anna thinks it's all part
of some higher plan.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.483
- I don't know,
but there's no way

16:58.485 --> 17:01.219
they're gonna give you
the epidural with your injuries,

17:01.221 --> 17:03.755
so I think acceptance is

17:03.757 --> 17:05.490
probably the best gift
you can giver her.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.192
- What?

17:08.194 --> 17:09.794
- She needs to know
she's got your full support.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.497
- No, no, no. The epidural.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.666
- Trauma to the spine prevents
you from receiving the epidural.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.770
I'm pretty sure that's why
they called the procedure off.

17:18.772 --> 17:21.439
- So, this is about
how much it's gonna hurt?

17:21.441 --> 17:24.442
- Well, pain, liability, safety,

17:24.444 --> 17:26.711
a bunch of other terms I'm sure
the lawyers have at the ready.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.113
- I'm not gonna let someone else
make that call.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.682
It's not gonna happen.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.493
- Well, good morning.

17:42.495 --> 17:46.230
It's rare someone gets
to my office earlier than me.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.765
- Sorry.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.108
It's about anna daley.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.544
- Trust me.
I understand your frustration.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.114
These transfusion cases are
always a rollercoaster,

18:03.116 --> 18:04.849
and they often don't end well.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.418
- I want to go through
with the donation,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.587
without the anesthesia
if need be.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.324
- Lieutenant,

18:13.326 --> 18:14.659
without that epidural,

18:14.661 --> 18:17.295
the procedure would be
intolerable.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.097
- I go into fires
that are 1,100 degrees

18:19.099 --> 18:21.099
wearing 45 pounds
of turnout gear.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.366
I can tolerate a lot.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.768
- Yes. I'm sure.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.770
But this isn't a conversation.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.705
Your doctors won't allow it,

18:27.707 --> 18:29.640
and I can't allow it.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.642
- If I don't do this,
she'll die.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.712
I won't let that happen.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.546
- Lieutenant,
you don't have a choice.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.276
.

18:48.277 --> 18:49.760
- Are we gonna have pizza?

18:49.762 --> 18:51.796
- Yeah, we sure are, buddy.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.664
Double pepperoni.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.399
- Hey, louie,
some of our friends wanted

18:55.401 --> 18:56.801
to have lunch with us.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.202
You think you can
share your pizza with them?

18:58.204 --> 18:59.437
- Okay.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.439
- Don't be nervous, okay?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.274
It's good to make new friends.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.181
- Here you go. Hold my hand.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.355
- Hey.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.857
Gabby.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.259
Matt.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.760
These are my parents.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.328
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.863
- Hey, there.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.736
- Hey!

19:31.738 --> 19:33.304
Hey, louie.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.772
I'm andre.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.508
How you doing, buddy?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.410
Want to sit down?
You want to take a seat?

19:42.415 --> 19:43.848
- Uh, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go order.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.449
- Okay.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.285
- Come on.
- Sit him down over here.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.788
- All right.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.191
- Okay, there we go.
- Okay.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.195
- Hey, what's up, man?

19:57.197 --> 19:59.263
- Gabby, right?

20:00.233 --> 20:01.232
I'm mary.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.667
- Nice to meet you.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.936
- What you're doing is
very brave.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.371
- Course.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.940
- Can't believe it.

20:08.942 --> 20:12.276
He looks just like andre did
when he was his age.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.581
We only found out
a few days ago.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.817
- It's a lot to take in.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.485
- Thank you
for keeping him safe,

20:21.487 --> 20:24.388
making him so happy.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.474
- Yeah, got it.
Same as every other place.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.309
Thank you. You too.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.480
- So, you can stop
with the calls.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.915
I will be the first call

20:50.917 --> 20:53.351
other hospital administrators
will make.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.019
- Yeah, I figured that.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.522
- And when you're cursing
in pain,

20:58.524 --> 21:01.259
you have clarke here
to thank for that.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.564
- We've convinced your doctors
to let you do the donation.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.469
Now, a tree had to lose its life

21:11.471 --> 21:13.504
for all of the papers
you have to sign,

21:13.506 --> 21:15.273
but if you're up for it,
so are we.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.442
- Can't take the fight
out of a soldier.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.446
- You sure?

21:27.420 --> 21:29.954
- What is that?
- This is butternut squash

21:29.956 --> 21:31.956
and brussels sprouts hash.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.824
- "the dude diet"?

21:33.826 --> 21:35.693
You trying to trick us
into eating healthy?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.428
- I'll stick with
the corned beef in my hash.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.863
- Just quit your whining
and try it.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.464
- Mm-mm.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.002
- Hey, not bad.
- Eh?

21:45.004 --> 21:47.905
- Hey, spielberg,
how's your masterpiece coming?

21:47.907 --> 21:50.474
- Well, that's the thing
about the calls recently is

21:50.476 --> 21:51.976
that they haven't been
exactly riveting.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.679
- Oh, come on, man. That
gas leak was pretty exciting.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.982
- Funny thing about gas leaks--
you can't see them.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.984
- All right, so, what about
that kitchen fire we had

21:59.986 --> 22:01.352
down on division?

22:01.354 --> 22:03.587
- The old lady
that left her hot plate on?

22:04.557 --> 22:06.023
- The guy who got tased
this morning?

22:06.025 --> 22:08.826
You got that, right?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.529
<i> - Down on the ground.</i>
<i> I said, down on the ground.</i>

22:11.531 --> 22:13.964
<i> Now!</i>
<i> Stop--no, stop right there!</i>

22:13.966 --> 22:17.101
<i> Taser, taser, taser.</i>
<i> - [screaming]</i>

22:17.970 --> 22:20.604
- yeah, we're screwed.

22:20.606 --> 22:21.839
- Yep.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.808
- Sharon goodwin from med.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.710
Kelly severide has been
given the go-ahead

22:25.712 --> 22:28.412
for his bone marrow donation.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.815
- Wait. What about
the anesthesia?

22:30.817 --> 22:33.050
'cause dawson said he wasn't
cleared for that.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.487
- Um, there isn't gonna be
any anesthesia.

22:39.692 --> 22:43.427
- So, they're going to drill
into his hip

22:43.429 --> 22:45.429
and just take it out?

22:45.431 --> 22:48.065
- That's right.
About a liter of it.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.667
- Whew.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.837
- That's a tough bastard.

22:54.107 --> 22:56.707
- So, please send your prayers
his way.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.813
- Ugh.

23:02.815 --> 23:06.717
- Hey, I bet boden wouldn't mind
if you took a few hours off,

23:06.719 --> 23:07.852
go see kelly.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.804
- Oh, yeah,
and then it would be

23:09.805 --> 23:11.755
about two minutes
before he kicked me out.

23:11.758 --> 23:14.892
- Stella, don't let
his lone wolf act fool you.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.761
He'd be happy to see you.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.669
- Hey. What's up?

23:25.671 --> 23:26.737
- Andre.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.472
- Can I speak to you
for a minute?

23:32.111 --> 23:33.811
- Yeah.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.112
What is it?

23:35.114 --> 23:38.582
- It's just--
these last couple days,

23:38.584 --> 23:40.017
and then meeting louie,

23:40.019 --> 23:42.853
it's got me spinning, you know?

23:42.855 --> 23:44.488
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about him.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.590
It's like my whole life
changed overnight.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.727
- What are you trying to say?

23:49.729 --> 23:51.695
- I know what I said before,

23:51.697 --> 23:54.665
but a son needs his father,

23:54.667 --> 23:56.000
and I need him.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.968
Look, I spoke
to my superior officer

23:57.970 --> 23:59.837
about a new post close to home,

23:59.839 --> 24:02.106
down at rock island.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.142
And he's supportive of it.

24:06.579 --> 24:10.147
And I want to do everything
in my power to make it happen.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.650
I want to fight for
full custody of my son.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.118
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.719
I'm not trying
to hurt you folks.

24:15.721 --> 24:16.987
That's not what this is about.
I promise.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.189
[alarm blares]

24:18.191 --> 24:19.857
- let's go. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.692
I really am.
<i> - Truck 81.</i>

24:21.694 --> 24:23.611
- Gabby.
<i> - Single-car accident.</i>

24:23.612 --> 24:25.529
<i> Edgebrook woods.</i>
<i> North branch trail extension.</i>

24:25.531 --> 24:27.031
- Get out of here!

24:32.238 --> 24:33.871
Go!

24:49.222 --> 24:50.988
- Hey!

24:53.826 --> 24:55.125
I'm sylvie.
We're here to help you.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.595
Are you guys okay?
- We're cold.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.029
- Hey, we need blankets
and heat pads.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.865
- Can you tell us
what you're doing out here?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.566
- Dad said to wait here
for help.

25:02.568 --> 25:04.702
- Your dad was here?
Where'd he go?

25:04.704 --> 25:06.237
- He went back for lizzie.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.273
- Dawson,
call another ambulance.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.609
Truck, with me.
- All right, guys...

25:12.278 --> 25:13.961
- Main, this is ambo 61

25:13.962 --> 25:15.645
requesting a second ambulance
at this location.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.848
- Fire department! Call out!

25:18.718 --> 25:20.017
- Hey! There's the car!

25:20.019 --> 25:21.619
- Move!

25:24.724 --> 25:25.890
- Sir!

25:25.892 --> 25:27.591
Sir, are you okay?

25:27.593 --> 25:29.727
- My daughter,
you have to help her.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.832
- Hey.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.002
Hey! I'm a firefighter.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.570
- [weakly] okay.

25:39.572 --> 25:40.971
- [grunts]

25:42.141 --> 25:44.074
I'm matt.
What's your name?

25:44.076 --> 25:45.843
- Lizzie.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.611
- We're gonna get you
out of there, quick as I can.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.713
We need the hurst, sawzall,
paratech struts,

25:49.715 --> 25:51.282
wedges, and a c-collar.

25:51.284 --> 25:53.317
- [breathing heavily]
- hey, hey, hey! Easy.

25:53.319 --> 25:54.885
Check out his leg.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.854
- Yeah.
- Okay, now breathe.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.822
- [shaky breathing]
- there you go. There you go.

25:58.824 --> 26:01.992
- [labored breathing]

26:03.563 --> 26:05.195
- dawson,

26:05.197 --> 26:07.898
we need you
and another backboard here now.

26:12.672 --> 26:13.938
.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.205
- [panting]

26:15.207 --> 26:17.875
- father got a compound fracture
and he's lost a lot of blood.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.743
Possible hypothermia.
- Okay.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.214
[grunts]
okay, let me take a look.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.883
- Yeah.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.792
- I could only get reception
up on the road.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.293
- You walked back and forth
on this leg?

26:36.295 --> 26:37.795
- I had to get them out.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.698
[panting]

26:40.700 --> 26:43.834
[saw buzzing]

26:54.146 --> 26:56.280
- okay, peel it back.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.952
[grunts]

27:01.954 --> 27:04.388
hey, do you feel okay?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.023
Gonna get you out.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.691
Got you.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.863
- Daddy!
- Lizzie!

27:12.865 --> 27:14.098
- They got her.
Don't worry.

27:14.100 --> 27:17.101
- Are you okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.936
- Hi, baby.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.770
<i> - Chief,</i>
<i> second ambulance is here.</i>

27:20.773 --> 27:23.140
- Copy that.
We'll put the father in the 61.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.308
We'll send the kids separately.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.011
- No, please!
I have to go with him!

27:27.013 --> 27:30.648
I have to be with my dad.
He would never leave me.

27:30.650 --> 27:34.251
- It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay, honey.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.853
It's gonna be okay.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.990
- Okay, yeah, you can come
with us. Come on.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.894
- Okay.
Three, two, one.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.729
- [grunts]

27:45.731 --> 27:47.398
- come on, kiddo.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.970
- Bp 130 over 80.
Heartrate 93.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.071
- All right,
they're done with the local.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.040
Last chance to back out, bud.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.341
- No. I'm good.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.943
- Okay, make the stab incision.

28:01.047 --> 28:04.048
- Oxygen's good.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.287
Syringe.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.608
Needle's in.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.893
- Now insert the jamshidi
and twist to the right.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.900
- All right,
here's the fun part, buddy.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.938
- 132 over 80.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.476
- [groans]

28:36.716 --> 28:39.416
[grunting]

28:46.358 --> 28:48.092
- hang in there, bud.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.295
- Prep the gauze.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.366
- [grunts]

28:56.368 --> 28:59.303
[indistinct chatter]

29:06.779 --> 29:09.179
- [loud scream]

29:10.483 --> 29:12.282
- okay, listen up.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.919
Severide is out of surgery.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.155
By all accounts, it went well,

29:18.157 --> 29:21.058
but he's in
for a bad couple of days.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.793
- Thank you, chief.
- Thanks, chief.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.061
- Copy, chief.
- Yup.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.769
- Hey, I was gonna tell you

29:31.771 --> 29:33.537
the chess thing worked
perfectly.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.139
- Yeah?
- I had an actual conversation

29:35.141 --> 29:37.808
with diego,
eye contact and everything.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.309
- That's great.
Did you beat him?

29:39.311 --> 29:41.145
- Oh, are you kidding me?
I got creamed.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.246
[both laugh]

29:42.248 --> 29:43.981
anyway, thank you.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.451
- Herrmann, can you take over?

29:47.453 --> 29:50.053
- I got your message.
That guy is out of his mind.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.855
Let's talk somewhere
in private.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.924
- Come on in.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.993
- Custody battles are
never pretty.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.245
I'm telling you now
there will be a time

29:58.246 --> 30:00.496
when you look back and think
this was one of the easy parts.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.199
- Great.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.902
- Now, you told me
mr. Keyes didn't show up

30:04.904 --> 30:06.970
to the initial meeting
that you and dcfs arranged

30:06.972 --> 30:08.872
between him and louie,
correct?

30:08.874 --> 30:10.491
- Yes.
- Correct.

30:10.492 --> 30:12.109
- Good, because we are going
to use that incident

30:12.111 --> 30:15.045
to paint him as an unreliable
and unstable parent,

30:15.047 --> 30:17.447
someone who can't be counted on
to show up, day in, day out.

30:17.449 --> 30:21.151
- Well, he--he just had
learned of his deployment.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.886
- We control the "whys," gabby,

30:22.888 --> 30:25.455
and we'll frame the facts
however we want.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.392
I have a private investigator
I want to use to dig into him.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.593
His family, too.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.262
Get us anything
from his past

30:31.263 --> 30:32.930
that can help bolster
our version of this guy.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.566
The longer this drags on,
the better for us.

30:35.568 --> 30:39.937
- I think we'd prefer not put
louie through this for too long.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.074
- Guys, trust me.
This is a good strategy.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.976
It all begins
with the hearing tomorrow.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.612
That's when we start
making our case.

30:48.614 --> 30:52.516
We are going to fight this,
tooth and nail, okay?

30:58.457 --> 31:00.190
- [sighs]

31:10.402 --> 31:11.935
- [grunts softly]

31:11.937 --> 31:13.503
- try not to move.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.173
The dilaudid's probably
wearing off,

31:16.175 --> 31:19.509
so just push the button
when you need more pain meds.

31:21.947 --> 31:24.348
Strongest stuff we can give you,
man, I'm sorry.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.121
Here.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.927
Just breathe.

31:47.973 --> 31:50.474
- We finished our interview
with mr. Keyes.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.376
We'd like to see all of you
together.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.089
- Uh...

32:07.626 --> 32:09.626
Um,

32:09.628 --> 32:12.162
yeah, I'm sure you weren't
expecting all these people.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.132
- No, we weren't.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.967
- Right.

32:16.969 --> 32:20.337
Well, I wanted you to see
louie's family.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.143
This is my older sister, leah,
and her crew.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.211
They live over on lakeview.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.614
And my sister tracy
and her family.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.950
They live down the block
from my parents.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.252
My uncle charles wanted
to come too,

32:35.254 --> 32:36.954
but I thought that might be
overkill.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.655
- Andre.

32:41.427 --> 32:44.294
- Look, I--
I've seen you with him.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.729
How much you love him.

32:45.731 --> 32:49.733
But I swear to you...
[sighs]

32:53.105 --> 32:55.605
I will love this boy...

32:57.176 --> 32:59.576
[shaky breathing]

32:59.578 --> 33:01.478
more than life itself.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.315
Everyone here will.

33:23.002 --> 33:25.535
- Uh, just one second.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.041
- What are we doing, matt?

33:31.043 --> 33:32.743
- I'm not sure anymore.

33:35.047 --> 33:37.647
- I love him so much.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.483
- I know.
Me too.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.618
- But this isn't about us.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.255
I can't do it.
I can't.

33:45.257 --> 33:49.593
I can't fight for a year.
For what?

33:49.595 --> 33:51.161
And what kind of people
would we be

33:51.163 --> 33:54.031
to deny louie all of this?

34:18.323 --> 34:19.990
.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.658
- I'm telling you,
a healthy duncan keith

34:21.659 --> 34:23.326
makes all the difference
on that back line.

34:23.328 --> 34:25.695
- All this and a hawks fan, too?

34:26.665 --> 34:28.565
- How are you feeling?

34:30.536 --> 34:31.735
- Been better.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.503
- No offense--
it's kind of nice

34:33.505 --> 34:36.206
not being the sickest person
in the room.

34:39.178 --> 34:42.379
- For once,
I'm not here for you.

34:42.381 --> 34:44.648
It is time to prep you
for the transplant.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.349
- Oh, my god.
[laughing]

34:46.351 --> 34:48.385
wow. You have no idea
how long I've been waiting

34:48.387 --> 34:50.253
to hear you say that.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.326
Kelly...

35:00.365 --> 35:02.532
Thank you so much.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.175
I'll take really good care
of your bone marrow.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.177
I promise.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.445
- [clicks tongue]

35:15.447 --> 35:17.280
- see you on the other side.

35:30.195 --> 35:32.329
- Throbbing, dizzy, can't eat?

35:33.298 --> 35:36.233
You don't have to pretend
for me, man.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.667
- Might hurt a little.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.536
[both chuckle]

35:42.541 --> 35:45.876
- what you did for anna--

35:45.878 --> 35:48.311
it's the bravest thing
I ever saw.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.322
- [groans softly]

36:02.628 --> 36:05.762
[breathing deeply]

36:08.333 --> 36:10.767
- can I take my monkey with me?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.836
- Of course you can. Here.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.871
You can take everything
with you.

36:16.608 --> 36:20.710
Your new room--
it's so big and sunny.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.879
And all your toys can fit
in there.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.348
You remember when you first came
to live with us?

36:25.350 --> 36:27.551
How brave and strong you were?

36:27.553 --> 36:29.686
And everything turned out
okay, didn't it?

36:30.822 --> 36:33.390
Well, I think...

36:34.927 --> 36:38.461
[voice breaking] that if you're
really brave and strong today,

36:38.463 --> 36:40.931
that this new home--

36:40.933 --> 36:43.366
everything's gonna turn out
even better.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.770
Okay?

36:47.739 --> 36:49.973
And we're not going anywhere.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.411
I will always be here for you...

36:54.413 --> 36:55.612
[sniffles]

36:55.614 --> 36:58.215
any time you want

36:58.217 --> 37:00.350
for the rest of your life.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.888
I love you.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.592
I will always love you.

37:08.594 --> 37:10.460
You hear me?

37:20.539 --> 37:22.305
Okay.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.809
All right,
you got to keep packing, okay?

37:25.811 --> 37:27.711
Put your boots in the suitcase.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.573
- I know it hurts.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.742
But they love him.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.544
He's gonna be so happy.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.515
- [sniffling]
- we were there

38:05.517 --> 38:07.684
when he needed us.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.954
No one can ever take that away.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.431
- It's today, yeah?

38:21.433 --> 38:24.467
- Louie's dad is picking him up
at their place.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.836
- I cannot imagine
what they're going through.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.974
- So, you missed all of it?

38:30.976 --> 38:32.676
Ripping the roof off that car?

38:32.678 --> 38:35.812
The hero dad?
Everything?

38:38.483 --> 38:40.417
- Yep.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.552
- And tonight's the deadline?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.956
- It was a good idea, otis.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.960
- Okay,
I'm gonna say something now.

38:52.397 --> 38:55.432
[sighs]
our family are not all here.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.533
I get that.

38:56.535 --> 39:00.870
And several of them are hurt.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.906
They may be suffering,
but they are not weak.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.975
They are among the strongest
men and women that I know.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.980
That is what it is
to be one of us,

39:10.982 --> 39:14.417
to be a firefighter,

39:14.419 --> 39:17.387
<i> to be able to change the fate</i>
<i> of the people that we meet.</i>

39:17.389 --> 39:20.023
<i> That means when we turn up</i>
<i> at a call,</i>

39:20.025 --> 39:22.092
<i> we don't see strangers.</i>

39:22.094 --> 39:23.693
<i> We see mothers and fathers,</i>

39:23.695 --> 39:26.796
<i> sons and daughters.</i>

39:26.798 --> 39:29.532
<i> It means</i>
<i> that when we see others</i>

39:29.534 --> 39:32.836
<i> running out of that fire,</i>

39:32.838 --> 39:36.106
<i> we run in.</i>

39:36.108 --> 39:40.910
<i> The job we've taken on is</i>
<i> to make a difference.</i>

39:40.912 --> 39:44.581
<i> What some in this house</i>
<i> have done this week--</i>

39:44.583 --> 39:47.117
<i> sacrificing their own health,</i>

39:47.119 --> 39:51.121
<i> their own happiness</i>

39:51.123 --> 39:55.692
<i> for that of another,</i>

39:55.694 --> 39:59.729
<i> that is the true meaning</i>
<i> of what we do.</i>

40:16.448 --> 40:18.948
- Hey.
Thanks. I got it.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.050
- Okay.
Hey, buddy.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.119
We'll see you soon, huh?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.094
- Hey.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.873
[sobs]

40:46.945 --> 40:49.112
you be a good boy, okay?

40:53.952 --> 40:56.586
- Hey, buddy.
What's up?

40:56.588 --> 40:59.923
Ready to go?

40:59.925 --> 41:01.991
Here, I'll take the monkey,
okay?

41:01.993 --> 41:03.793
All right.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.462
Come on, son.
