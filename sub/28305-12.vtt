WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.567
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Here we go, friends.

00:02.611 --> 00:05.048
As you know,
Jane still loved Rafael,

00:05.092 --> 00:07.268
but she was trying to move on,
so they could focus

00:07.311 --> 00:09.487
on being good co-parents,
which was important

00:09.531 --> 00:12.142
because Mateo was recently
diagnosed with ADHD.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.492
And they had to figure out
how to best help him.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.059
Medication is
a lifelong decision

00:16.103 --> 00:17.495
and he is so young,
and I just...

00:17.539 --> 00:19.367
Jane, I agree.
Mm.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.064
We should try
other options first.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.197
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, not an easy decision.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.982
And speaking of decisions,
Jane had decided to move in

00:26.026 --> 00:27.462
to her own apartment.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.290
I just think it's time
for the next phase of my life.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.508
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also entering the next phase...

00:30.552 --> 00:32.510
Poor Petra.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.817
See, J.R. broke up with her
and moved to Houston,

00:34.860 --> 00:37.037
but at least Petra got
her other ex back.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.864
What will it take for you
to come back to me?

00:38.908 --> 00:40.083
Triple my salary.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.738
Her old assistant Krishna.

00:42.781 --> 00:45.219
And I want a lunch hour
every day.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.221
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in other great news,
Xo found out

00:47.264 --> 00:49.484
she was cancer-free.ROGELIO: Oh.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.225
Thank God. I'm so happy.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.922
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But he was less happy
about this:

00:52.965 --> 00:54.880
Finally.
We can be together.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.926
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So Rogelio set River straight.

00:56.969 --> 01:00.103
Let me make this perfectly
clear, I love my wife.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.757
I don't want
to have sex with you,

01:01.800 --> 01:03.541
I have never wanted
to have sex with you.

01:03.585 --> 01:04.629
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Unfortunately,

01:04.673 --> 01:05.978
hell hath no fury

01:06.022 --> 01:07.545
like River Fields scorned.

01:07.589 --> 01:11.114
He loves me not...
he will pay.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.116
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So let's see what happens next.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.902
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was six years old,

01:16.946 --> 01:19.122
she was in her first musical.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.952
♪ We're gonna dance
and sing all night ♪

01:22.995 --> 01:24.954
♪ We love to laugh...

01:24.997 --> 01:27.174
Here comes her solo.

01:27.217 --> 01:30.002
♪ I like to sing
'cause singing is fun... ♪

01:30.046 --> 01:34.311
Oof. Yeah, turns out,
it was also her last.

01:34.355 --> 01:37.575
Because that voice
was a deal-breaker.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.361
Today's my first rehearsal
for the musical.

01:40.404 --> 01:43.538
But, hey, maybe musical talent
skips a generation?

01:43.581 --> 01:46.149
I know, it's so exciting.
And take it from me, Mateo,

01:46.193 --> 01:49.631
your first school musical is an
experience you'll never forget.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.415
And can never un-hear.

01:51.459 --> 01:52.851
I'm gonna be a tree,

01:52.895 --> 01:53.983
and I'm in the forest.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.898
My costume needs
to be brown and green,

01:55.941 --> 01:58.422
so can you make me a costume
that's brown and green?

01:58.466 --> 02:02.078
On it. You are gonna be brown
and green from head to toe. Huh?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.950
I also have to learn lines
and a dance.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.909
Then we will practice
until you got it cold.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.084
And on opening night,

02:08.128 --> 02:09.955
I will be in the front row
cheering on

02:09.999 --> 02:11.174
the best tree in Miami.

02:11.218 --> 02:14.003
Now come on,
let's see those branches.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.494
Go get the rest of your things
for school, my little star.

02:26.537 --> 02:27.799
Ooh.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.019
Laundry. Yes.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.021
"Laundry in unit."

02:37.635 --> 02:38.941
You hate the way I fold.

02:38.984 --> 02:40.769
Rafael told me
to make a list

02:40.812 --> 02:43.075
of all the things I absolutely
need for an apartment.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.121
I'm meeting with him later today

02:45.165 --> 02:47.297
to go over
his available listings.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.607
Mm. You know
how the old saying goes.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.174
First comes love,
then almost-marriage,

02:54.217 --> 02:55.610
then platonic friendship

02:55.653 --> 02:57.177
and then
he's your real estate agent.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.396
[laughs softly]

03:01.398 --> 03:02.486
JANE:
Oh...

03:02.530 --> 03:04.314
[shouts]MATEO: Sorry.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.015
Yes.

03:10.059 --> 03:13.149
Carpet is a deal-breaker. Ugh.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.152
I hope Raf can find me something
with all these must-haves.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.111
XIOMARA:
I must have biked
20 miles today.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.810
After three weeks of
daily spin classes,

03:21.853 --> 03:23.377
I was finally able
to get through

03:23.420 --> 03:25.161
every set of jumps again.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.989
I'm so happy for you, Xiomara.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.034
Just don't overdo it.
You've hardly sat still.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.515
I'm just soaking up life,
now that I can.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.735
Now, me and my
heavyweight hamstrings

03:33.778 --> 03:35.389
are gonna take a shower,
then I've got lunch

03:35.432 --> 03:37.434
with some girlfriends I
haven't seen in a while.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.870
Sounds great.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.829
Are you okay, babe?

03:40.872 --> 03:43.005
You tossed and
turned all night.It's River.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.529
She's driving me crazy.Wha-- I thought you said

03:45.573 --> 03:47.749
she was being
really nice lately?Exactly.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.099
It's been weeks
since I rejected her,

03:50.142 --> 03:52.971
and she has yet to retaliate.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.974
Maybe that means she's over it?

03:56.018 --> 04:00.152
Xiomara, my-my sweet,
naive wife.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.590
Of course
she's not over it.

04:02.633 --> 04:06.942
She is biding her time,
plotting her revenge.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.944
Is there any chance
you're being paranoid?

04:08.987 --> 04:11.642
Not at all. Just ask Rudy.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.209
Cupcake?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.777
Why, thank you.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.083
Taste this,
see if it's poisoned.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.045
Rudy was sick for a week.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.047
Doesn't he have
a gluten allergy?

04:25.090 --> 04:27.005
So he says.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He does.

04:27.049 --> 04:29.269
Rogelio, I obviously
don't like River.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.575
But I don't think she's
poisoning you for rejecting her.

04:31.619 --> 04:35.057
Well, then, you're playing right
into her unusually large hands.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.320
It's just that you have a
tendency to get carried away.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.584
Oh, do I? Do I?

04:40.628 --> 04:42.891
Maybe that's a quality
you should mention

04:42.934 --> 04:48.200
when you give my eulogy right
after River poisons me to death.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.420
I'm taking a shower.

04:50.464 --> 04:53.336
Try to relax.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.164
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
He looks relaxed.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.428
♪ Everything needs love
to grow ♪

04:58.472 --> 05:00.691
♪ It's love, love, love

05:00.735 --> 05:03.694
♪ The world is love, love...

05:03.738 --> 05:06.175
EVERETTE:
Okay, hold up
one second. Mateo,

05:06.218 --> 05:07.698
you are a tree,
you are not a rock.

05:07.742 --> 05:11.093
Would you please stand up
and join the rest of the forest?

05:11.136 --> 05:13.791
Okay, from the top.
Five, six, seven, eight.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.316
[imitates farting]

05:16.359 --> 05:17.752
[laughter]And we're singing.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.667
Let me hear my trees!I'm not a tree,

05:19.710 --> 05:21.016
I'm a helicopter.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.626
[laughter]

05:28.197 --> 05:29.938
CLASSMATE:
You killed the trees.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.461
Mateo ruins everything.

05:31.505 --> 05:34.769
PETRA:
He made a complete mess
of everything.

05:34.812 --> 05:37.554
I mean, all the temps were bad,
but the last one took the cake.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.208
Literally. I had a
birthday cake on my desk,

05:39.251 --> 05:40.383
and he took it.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.689
That does seem gratuitous.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.038
Anyway, here.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.387
I need you to take care
of this list.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.128
Are you forgetting something?

05:46.171 --> 05:48.565
Please.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.264
I don't do dry cleaning anymore.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.310
Fine. I'll take that
off the list.

05:54.354 --> 05:58.009
But can you get started,
um, on the other things?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.360
Please?

06:00.403 --> 06:01.491
Happy to.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.145
Also, I have something
to tell you.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.407
It's bad news.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.495
But before I tell you,

06:05.539 --> 06:07.323
remember what we discussed.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.891
I am just the messenger.

06:09.934 --> 06:13.242
Yes, of course. Whatever it is,
I will remember my manners

06:13.285 --> 06:14.809
and I won't take it out on you.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.464
Milos called.
He wants to sell the hotel.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.379
What?!

06:19.422 --> 06:21.381
Sorry.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.904
Can you elaborate?

06:22.947 --> 06:24.601
He said he owns
two-thirds

06:24.645 --> 06:27.430
of the hotel and can sell at
any time without your approval.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.693
Well, that's ridiculous.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.043
I need you to schedule
a visitation at the prison.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.480
Already done.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.655
[clears throat]

06:34.698 --> 06:36.439
Thank you.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.615
You're welcome.
I'll get started on that list.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.051
JANE:
Here's the list.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.401
All my must-haves
for the apartment.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.663
And, if you look
on the back,

06:42.706 --> 06:44.491
you'll find a list of
all the deal-breakers.

06:44.534 --> 06:48.408
Which, judging by your face,
is possibly a bit extensive.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.670
I can revise it.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.498
No, no, it's... it's not that.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.325
The list, it's a good list.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.936
So what's wrong?

06:54.979 --> 06:57.895
[sighs]

06:57.939 --> 06:59.462
Mateo got kicked out
of the musical

06:59.506 --> 07:00.681
for disrupting rehearsal.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.291
Kicked out?
What did he do?

07:02.334 --> 07:03.988
What didn't he do?

07:04.032 --> 07:06.164
He's lying down,
he's getting up, he's screaming.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.427
[sighs]

07:07.470 --> 07:11.387
He's really struggling, Jane.
I saw him.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.389
I think we should
consider medication.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.393
We have been trying and trying,
and holistic isn't helping.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.787
And it's starting to affect
things in a big way.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.266
We said we'd give it
another month.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.181
I don't need another month
to see that it's not working.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.270
We can't just put him on meds
because of one bad day.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.272
It's not one bad day.
There's a pattern here.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.536
We're getting
ahead of ourselves.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.538
Jane...Medication is a
serious decision.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.888
I know that it's serious.There can be side effects.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.237
Which we'll monitor,
but it could also be

07:35.280 --> 07:36.847
really good for him.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.808
Can we please just give it
a little more time?

07:40.851 --> 07:42.984
I'll talk to his teacher,
I'll get him back in the play.

07:43.027 --> 07:47.641
Uh, we can reevaluate in
a couple weeks? Please?

07:50.339 --> 07:52.297
All right.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.082
[exhales]

07:54.125 --> 07:56.084
He was so excited
about the play.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.347
Ugh, I know. I was, too.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.654
[laughs softly]

08:00.697 --> 08:02.003
Mm...

08:02.046 --> 08:04.135
Ah, I just hate
to see him struggle.

Um, uh...

08:16.278 --> 08:18.585
Jane, this is Julie.
Julie,

08:18.628 --> 08:20.587
this is Jane.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.807
Oh, Jane.
Hi, I've heard a lot about you.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.418
Oh? Uh, do you work
in the office?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.377
Wha-- no.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.510
Rafa and I are dating.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.728
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Rafa?

08:31.772 --> 08:33.382
And I just came by
because I thought

08:33.425 --> 08:34.992
I'd surprise you for lunch.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.080
Well, she certainly
surprised someone.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.039
Perfect timing.
I was just leaving.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.607
You two enjoy your lunch date.
[chuckles]

08:44.393 --> 08:45.612

08:50.399 --> 08:51.922
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
We last left Jane upset

08:51.966 --> 08:54.055
that her real estate agent
is seeing someone.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.361
Hey. Do you have time
for a single ladies chat?

08:56.405 --> 08:57.580
Only if you stop
calling it that.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.017
[laughing moan]

09:00.061 --> 09:02.106
I met the new girl
that Raf is seeing.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.805
But he didn't warn me that
he was dating someone specific,

09:04.848 --> 09:07.459
so I was just really thrown off.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.809
I'm sure it's
nothing serious.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.419
He hasn't mentioned
anyone to me.
Yeah?

09:10.462 --> 09:11.681

that was easy.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.143
We still got it!BRETT: Hi, there.

27:03.186 --> 27:06.450
I'm Brett. This is Nick.Hi, Brett and Nick.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.931
Do you have names?Oh, that depends.
Are you buying us drinks?

27:08.975 --> 27:11.934
Hey, man. Let me get
four tequila shots.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.980
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh, is it just me,
or are Brett and Nick

27:14.023 --> 27:15.285
too young to grow facial hair?

27:15.329 --> 27:17.505
So, uh, how old
are you guys?

27:17.548 --> 27:18.724
Guess.PETRA: Ha!

27:18.767 --> 27:19.986
Pass. How old?

27:20.029 --> 27:22.292
Strict. I like it.

27:22.336 --> 27:25.078
Well, I'm 22 and a half.21 and three-quarters.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.515
[Jane and Petra laugh]What?

27:27.558 --> 27:29.909
She's got socks
older than you guys.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.650
Oh, don't worry.
We're really mature.

27:32.738 --> 27:36.132
Wow. That is
great to know.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.873
So do you like kids?

27:37.917 --> 27:40.093
Because we'd love for you
to meet our children.

27:40.136 --> 27:41.572
What?

27:41.616 --> 27:44.314
Yeah! Between us, we've got
three little rug rats.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.142
Do you want
to see pictures?[gasps] Ooh!

27:46.186 --> 27:48.014
Shoot, uh,

27:48.057 --> 27:49.319
you know,
I just realized,

27:49.363 --> 27:50.364
we got to get going.Yeah, we got to

27:50.407 --> 27:51.365
get up early
in the morning.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.106
Finals week.Oh.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.586
Yeah.

27:55.630 --> 27:58.894
[laughs]Well, that went well.

27:58.938 --> 28:01.114
Come on. They were the first
people that we talked to.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.158
It'll get better.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.770
Now, mmm, let's
do these shots.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.686
Mmm...Mm?

28:10.863 --> 28:12.342
Bodyguard?

28:13.430 --> 28:15.432
[hammering]

28:18.392 --> 28:21.656
Uh, excuse me, crew people.
Have you seen my bodyguard?

28:23.310 --> 28:24.964
[quietly]:
Okay.

28:28.228 --> 28:31.361
LAIRD:
Oh, really?
[chuckles]

28:33.276 --> 28:35.322
[gasps]

28:35.365 --> 28:38.804
Ah, you temptress!

28:38.847 --> 28:41.720
You stole my bodyguard
to punish me,

28:41.763 --> 28:45.027
you wicked,
conniving snake of a...

28:45.071 --> 28:46.768
Oh, Rogelio, stop!

28:46.812 --> 28:48.901
This has nothing
to do with you.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.467
Laird and I
began talking

28:50.511 --> 28:55.559
during break and well,
we just... hit it off.

28:55.603 --> 28:59.825
[chuckles] Turns out
we both love cooking.

28:59.868 --> 29:03.002
And Tibetan beading,
and ayurvedic massage.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.307
Oh, come on!

29:04.351 --> 29:05.831
It's obvious you've been

29:05.874 --> 29:07.658
plotting against me
for weeks now.

29:07.702 --> 29:08.964
And clearly this is

29:09.008 --> 29:10.879
part of your master plan.
What's next?

29:10.923 --> 29:14.230
Have Laird drown me
in Lake Brenda?

29:14.274 --> 29:18.452
[laughs] There's
no "next," Rogelio.

29:18.495 --> 29:21.847
I've been getting
my revenge for weeks.

29:21.890 --> 29:25.807
Watching you go crazy,
anxiously waiting for me

29:25.851 --> 29:27.983
to do something evil.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.855
Oh, it worked
like a charm.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.813
You're not sleeping, you
got bags under your eyes,

29:31.857 --> 29:34.642
and your worry wrinkles are
worse than they've ever been.

29:34.685 --> 29:38.167
I knew that if I just behaved
like the professional I am,

29:38.211 --> 29:40.822
you would drive
yourself crazy.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.868
[chuckles]
And you have.

29:42.911 --> 29:43.912
Look.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.871
I'm not the
kind of woman

29:45.914 --> 29:48.351
who's used to
getting rejected.

29:48.395 --> 29:49.962
Watching you

29:50.005 --> 29:51.964
torture yourself these
past few weeks has

29:52.007 --> 29:54.270
been delightful.
[chuckles]

29:54.314 --> 29:57.447
But I'm ready to
call it even. Okay?

29:57.491 --> 29:58.840
Okay.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.627
But you're so fired, Laird.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.420
You were so right.

30:13.463 --> 30:16.858
Asking Darci to send us a man
for River was genius.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.251
She's done with me.

30:18.294 --> 30:21.036
Hey, it's Darci's
algorithm, not mine.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.473
And now that River has
someone else to obsess over,

30:23.517 --> 30:24.866
she'll be out
of our hair.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.738
And hopefully,
mine will start growing back.

30:27.782 --> 30:30.002
I noticed a few bald spots
from all the stress.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.873
I'm sure it will.Well, the point is,

30:31.917 --> 30:34.745
that joy will return
to my job.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.878
Mm.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.184
So how about you?

30:38.227 --> 30:40.055
Did, uh, teaching Mateo
give you the bug

30:40.099 --> 30:41.404
to get back
to teaching?

30:41.448 --> 30:45.452
Maybe. Just weighing
my options.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.062
Right.
Soaking up life.

Deal-breaker.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.988
Okay. My turn.
What about her?

31:00.032 --> 31:01.903
That woman hasn't
taken her eye

31:01.947 --> 31:03.949
off you all night.[phone chimes]

[sighs] My lawyers can't stop
Milos from selling the hotel.

31:21.488 --> 31:24.578
Well, you've found
ways around

31:24.621 --> 31:26.014
that kind of thing
before, right?

31:26.058 --> 31:27.929
Yes, but that would
involve lying,

31:27.973 --> 31:29.931
and I can't do that
anymore because...

31:29.975 --> 31:31.150
Because...?

31:31.193 --> 31:32.629
Because J.R. changed me.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.936
Made me want to be
a freakin' good person

31:34.980 --> 31:36.155
who deserves her,
and now--

31:36.198 --> 31:37.896
Oh, God,
what happened to me?

31:37.939 --> 31:39.985
[chuckles]
Oh, honestly,

31:40.028 --> 31:42.030
I think you were
always a good person.

31:42.074 --> 31:45.033
It just took J.R. to finally
bring it out of you.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.818
And you will meet
someone else.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.690
That I love as much
as I love her?

31:49.733 --> 31:50.952
Yeah.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.780
I really believe that.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.956
Well, I think you will, too.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.827
I hope so.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.960
Well, if I will,
you will, trust me.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.483
You're way more likeable.

You're just leaving now?

32:21.374 --> 32:23.898
I literally always leave
at this hour.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.073
Of course you do.

32:25.117 --> 32:27.032
Because you're such
a good assistant.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.486
I've officially decided
not to perjure myself.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.096
Milos can rot in prison
till he dies.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.969
Which means I may
lose the hotel,

don't you worry,

32:52.883 --> 32:54.059

and dancing with Mateo,

are helping.

what that is.

you have time.
