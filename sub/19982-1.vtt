02:16.236 --> 02:19.104
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. I'm outside.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.741
Alright.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.218
Daddy's little Princess.

02:39.859 --> 02:43.762
So you want me to get in close?

02:43.764 --> 02:46.565
Look for a way in?
Maybe check for an alarm system?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.634
No, don't worry,
they have an alarm system.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.936
Don't worry?

02:52.038 --> 02:54.873
Ade, trust me.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.476
It gets a lot worse than just
a fuckin' alarm system.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.993
This needs to be surgical.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.262
No mistakes. We gotta cover all the angles.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.731
It's gonna take time to plan this.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.968
Six weeks, that's what we've got.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.503
You can't rush this.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.105
We got six weeks or this doesn't happen.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.273
If you can't do it, tell us now

03:28.275 --> 03:30.776
so I can find someone who can.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.712
All I'm saying is that
I've been doin' this

03:33.714 --> 03:36.715
for long enough to know that
there are only two outcomes

03:36.717 --> 03:39.284
to this little situation of ours.

03:39.286 --> 03:43.755
One is where we plan this properly.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.958
The second is where we don't get caught.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.728
Look, none of us are here
because we wanna be.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.463
Okay, this is the last chance
we're gonna get

03:51.465 --> 03:53.532
at a normal fuckin' life.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.766
We've taken things this far

03:54.768 --> 03:56.835
because we all understand
the risks involved.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.906
They're completely predictable.

04:00.908 --> 04:01.907
Yeah, that's the first mistake.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.509
We can't assume anything on this job.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.512
He's got access to diamonds.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.947
A lot of diamonds.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.016
Owns a chain of distributors.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.784
Has access to all the safes all the time.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.053
Expect the unexpected,
that's all I'm saying.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.423
Coming from a guy
that's been in prison twice.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.858
Third time, they throw away the
key. You know that, don't you?

04:20.861 --> 04:23.161
Yeah, we're gonna learn
from your mistakes.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.797
That's why we're cousins.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.399
Yeah, that's a zippy new hairdo

04:27.401 --> 04:29.401
you got there, Goldilocks.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.136
You hiding from someone?

04:31.138 --> 04:33.205
Are you running away from something?

04:35.274 --> 04:38.043
Sometimes, all you can do is run, Mark.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.612
I think we can all agree on one thing.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.681
The sooner we get this
over with, the better.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.787
This thing has to go down
without a glitch.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.423
It needs to tick-tick like a Swiss watch.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.947
You boys all good?

05:15.949 --> 05:19.017
Apart from freezing my balls
off, I'm just peachy.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.721
You have balls, James?

05:25.057 --> 05:26.458
Turn right here.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.221
Hey, protection only.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.523
Yeah, for protection only.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.363
Ade, take the front.
James, take the back.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.798
Yeah, got it.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.268
- Okay, you ready?
- Yup.

06:12.905 --> 06:15.173
Yeah.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.875
Let's do this.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.380
Huh?

07:07.994 --> 07:10.996
That's... Interesting.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.731
What the fuck?

09:54.727 --> 09:56.161
That's right.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.265
Do what I say and I won't hurt you.

10:09.975 --> 10:11.509
Go, go!

10:16.816 --> 10:18.750
Ade, lock this bitch down!

11:56.282 --> 11:57.816
Perfect.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.151
Who's there?

13:13.692 --> 13:16.194
Remind me to scrap the we'll
return-your-daughter-unharmed

13:16.196 --> 13:17.428
part of the ransom video.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.630
What the fuck's going on here?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.031
We didn't do this.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.100
Stick to the plan, no matter what.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.201
Well, something's not right.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.836
Looks like we rescued her from that house.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.905
Stick to the plan.

13:41.553 --> 13:43.888
Drink up. We have a busy night.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.192
Fuckers.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.663
What did you say?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.564
You should really let me go.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.667
It'll be better for all of you.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.444
Please.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.513
Please just let me go.
I haven't seen your faces.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.715
I don't know how many
of you there are. Please.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.988
This may be the last footage
anyone ever sees of you.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.390
Make it matter.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.503
Fucking wiring.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.775
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, good evening...

15:10.777 --> 15:13.144
It's a sick joke, mom!
Don't believe them!

15:15.248 --> 15:17.181
You know the rules here.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.885
The quicker we get this done,
the quicker you go home.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.724
Take two.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.795
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,
we have your daughter...

15:30.797 --> 15:33.064
don't pay them, daddy!
They're in over their heads.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.733
Hey, hey, stop. I got this.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.268
Leave it.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.573
Hey.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.642
You wanna know a secret?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.980
You're gonna make it out of this unharmed.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.049
Okay? This..

15:52.017 --> 15:53.818
It's all for show.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.953
The last thing we wanna do is hurt you.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.792
Now I know you love your dad very much.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.460
He's done bad things to some people.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.595
Taken things that don't belong to him.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.333
Now your daddy's rich.

16:10.769 --> 16:14.105
What we're taking,
he'll make up very quickly.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.175
This is just what we have to do
to get the money.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.878
It'll all be over
very, very quick if you behave.

16:23.949 --> 16:27.051
Rehearsal's over, okay?

16:29.054 --> 16:30.521
Okay?

16:31.723 --> 16:33.191
Okay.

16:36.261 --> 16:40.264
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson,
here is your daughter.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.800
She's having a really bad night.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.002
We want the 300 carats of diamonds

16:45.004 --> 16:47.638
you keep in your various premises.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.841
This is a time-sensitive matter for us.

16:51.276 --> 16:53.478
Mom, dad, please do what they say.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.314
Give them the diamonds, please!
I wanna come home!

16:56.316 --> 16:58.583
I wanna come home, please!

17:00.385 --> 17:02.520
Send it. I'll make the call.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.136
No one's answering!

17:18.137 --> 17:19.537
Try again.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.155
- The number you have reached is not in service.
- Shit.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.424
Try their cell phones.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.642
Ade, you're certain
these are the right numbers?

17:57.644 --> 17:59.610
Yeah, I checked them over and over.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.046
Fuck!

18:02.048 --> 18:04.448
You wanna wait it out?

18:04.450 --> 18:05.883
Because you're the one who said

18:05.885 --> 18:07.852
this thing needed to be slick, quiet

18:07.854 --> 18:09.554
and most importantly, fast!

18:09.556 --> 18:10.888
I know what I fucking said!

18:10.890 --> 18:12.423
Haze, you need to stay calm.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.492
This is me calm.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.713
You guys need to go back to the house.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.250
- No.
- No? That's it?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.419
You wanna bring somethin' else
to the table here?

18:41.421 --> 18:43.020
That's not the plan.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.789
Yeah, it is the plan.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.857
It's called plan B.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.562
What if it's a trap?

18:51.564 --> 18:54.232
They don't know
what they're tryin' to trap.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.601
We haven't made contact yet!

18:56.603 --> 18:58.736
There's no way they've watched the video

18:58.738 --> 19:01.339
and gone to the cops
in the last three minutes.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.075
We can't babysit this girl
for days, alright?

19:04.077 --> 19:05.610
People are gonna know
that I'm up to something.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.144
I've got a court date in three days

19:07.146 --> 19:08.679
and I need to be out
of the fucking country.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.880
I need to be in Panama.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.016
This deal needs to go down like we planned.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.085
Then you fuckin' go.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.595
I'm with you, cuz.

19:29.234 --> 19:31.836
Just scope it out. Stay in touch.

19:37.175 --> 19:40.611
You hear anything, you let us know.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.313
Yeah, I gotcha.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.316
Hey.

19:47.452 --> 19:50.388
You be careful, okay?

19:51.723 --> 19:53.224
Yeah.

20:19.785 --> 20:23.020
The wiring in this place is fucked up.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.158
Just go. No one's afraid of the dark.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.829
Maybe you should be.

20:57.956 --> 20:58.989
It's just a power trip.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.958
I don't think the system's fried.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.327
How brave are you feelin'?

21:03.329 --> 21:04.729
I'm not.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.465
Look, getting the scanner up
and running is top priority.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.933
I need you to check the breaker switch

21:08.935 --> 21:11.001
while I reboot the system.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.173
Remember that foster home we had?

21:16.175 --> 21:18.376
The ones that never paid
their electric bill?

21:18.378 --> 21:21.078
- Yeah.
- Well, it's just like that.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.147
The switch is in the basement though.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.885
Of course, it is.

21:33.592 --> 21:35.126
It'd be great if those two could do

21:35.128 --> 21:37.461
some of the dirty work every now and then.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.530
Yeah, man, this is a fuck-up!

21:44.936 --> 21:47.371
Keep your eyes on the road.

21:48.907 --> 21:52.443
Let's at least try not to kill
another family member.

21:54.379 --> 21:55.946
Nice.

22:49.935 --> 22:52.470
That's a good girl.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.538
You just stay there.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.704
You should really let me go.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.041
Or you're all gonna die tonight.

24:42.447 --> 24:43.881
Your dad's smart.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.817
He'll get you out of this.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.535
How do you know that song?

25:40.405 --> 25:42.973
I used to sing that when I was a kid.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.642
That's not all I know.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.512
I also know why you kidnapped me.

25:48.514 --> 25:50.581
Why you chose me.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.884
But it's not gonna bring them back.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.188
I know that your parents died in that fire.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.356
You shut up.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.625
And that you feel responsible.

26:01.627 --> 26:05.062
Responsible because you lived
and they died.

26:10.735 --> 26:14.738
Don't you think for a second
that I can't become the bad guy.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.107
For the right reasons

26:17.109 --> 26:19.243
I'll become your worst fuckin' nightmare.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.444
Hello?

28:07.485 --> 28:09.086
This place stinks.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.555
You smell that before?

28:12.690 --> 28:14.091
No.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.634
Hey, same as before.

28:23.636 --> 28:26.503
We find the parents
and get to the bottom of this.

29:18.957 --> 29:21.658
Sneaky fuckers.

29:21.660 --> 29:25.329
You think you're safe
by hidin' in the basement.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.919
We've got your daughter.

29:57.195 --> 29:59.529
Why our little girl? Why this house?

30:02.333 --> 30:04.735
Why our little girl? Why this house?

30:06.771 --> 30:09.139
Why our little girl? Why this house?

30:11.075 --> 30:13.477
Why our little girl? Why this house?

30:16.180 --> 30:18.515
Why our little girl? Why this house?

30:20.618 --> 30:22.686
Why our little girl...

30:58.389 --> 31:00.457
Fuck!

31:00.459 --> 31:02.526
Oh, my god! What the fuck!

31:06.497 --> 31:08.231
Fuck!

31:12.503 --> 31:14.071
James?

31:49.507 --> 31:51.508
Cuz, is that you?

32:44.662 --> 32:46.129
Oh, thank god.

33:22.968 --> 33:25.535
Ade! Are you okay? What happened?

33:25.537 --> 33:26.770
I fuckin' saw Georgie.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.238
That's impossible. George is dead!

33:28.240 --> 33:29.906
You think I'd make this shit up?

33:29.908 --> 33:31.741
It's this place.
It's this place, it's fucked!

33:31.743 --> 33:32.976
It's completely fucked!

33:32.978 --> 33:35.145
The parents, her parents are dead.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.647
Yeah, and there are two
more dead bodies downstairs!

33:37.649 --> 33:39.916
Well, their... their... their chests
were ripped or torn or somethin'.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.252
Jesus, fuck, it's a mess!

33:42.254 --> 33:43.753
Oh, shit.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.422
Oh, shit, we're gonna get blamed for this.

33:45.424 --> 33:48.191
No, the fucking cops are gonna
think that we did this!

33:48.193 --> 33:50.560
That we broke into the house
and we did this!

33:53.131 --> 33:54.631
We need to get outta here. Now!

33:54.633 --> 33:56.666
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go!

33:57.735 --> 33:59.069
Come on.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.274
Ade, get up!

34:06.777 --> 34:08.011
Come on!

34:16.987 --> 34:19.322
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

34:19.324 --> 34:20.757
Easy, man!

34:22.760 --> 34:23.827
Shit!

34:29.634 --> 34:31.434
What the fuck?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.781
What the fuck?

35:57.955 --> 35:59.723
Sarah?

36:24.515 --> 36:25.515
Daddy?

36:32.623 --> 36:34.891
Jesus. What the fuck?

37:01.252 --> 37:03.853
Ade. Ade.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.493
Cuz?

37:16.634 --> 37:19.369
I'm gonna get help, cuz.
I'm gonna go get help.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.372
I'm gonna get help, cuz.

38:21.632 --> 38:22.966
James.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.034
James!

38:26.070 --> 38:27.537
Oh, fuck.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.542
James!

38:43.254 --> 38:44.587
James!

38:53.998 --> 38:55.532
James!

39:00.704 --> 39:03.640
Come on. Come on, get it together.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.208
Come on.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.246
Mark?

40:18.282 --> 40:19.883
Mark?

40:23.754 --> 40:25.255
Mark?

40:37.601 --> 40:38.968
Mark?

41:00.224 --> 41:01.658
Mark?

42:07.891 --> 42:09.792
Mark!

42:09.794 --> 42:11.060
Hey!

42:13.497 --> 42:14.797
Aah!

42:39.590 --> 42:41.157
Hazel.

42:42.192 --> 42:43.760
Mom?

42:45.896 --> 42:48.031
Come to me, Hazel.

43:09.654 --> 43:11.287
Where the hell have you been?

43:11.289 --> 43:12.555
I heard something.

43:12.557 --> 43:14.390
What, what do you mean
you heard something?

43:14.392 --> 43:16.759
I saw Sarah.

43:16.761 --> 43:17.994
What?

43:17.996 --> 43:19.862
I know you think I'm fuckin' crazy.

43:19.864 --> 43:21.864
No, no, no. No.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.636
That's what scares me.

43:28.739 --> 43:30.440
James!

43:30.442 --> 43:31.441
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

43:31.443 --> 43:33.276
Come on, we gotta get back. Hey.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.947
Ade, I saw my mom.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.549
She came back.

43:39.551 --> 43:42.385
She came back to fuck me up even more.

43:42.387 --> 43:43.853
Hey, listen to me.

43:43.855 --> 43:46.022
Alright, your mom died
five fuckin' years ago.

43:46.024 --> 43:48.091
Okay, that bitch is in hell. Now come on!

44:00.571 --> 44:02.071
Fuck!

44:03.540 --> 44:05.174
Hazel!

44:09.113 --> 44:10.947
What happened?

44:35.806 --> 44:37.673
Is he gonna be okay?

44:37.675 --> 44:39.842
It's not like
we can rush him to a hospital.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.410
Look, could this be
some kind of a reaction?

44:41.412 --> 44:43.012
Reaction?

44:43.014 --> 44:45.214
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

44:45.216 --> 44:46.449
Did he tell you what he saw in the woods?

44:46.451 --> 44:48.518
Did he tell you he saw his dead mother?

44:51.421 --> 44:52.722
There's something very wrong

44:52.724 --> 44:54.123
with that house on Willow street.

44:54.125 --> 44:56.492
What are you getting at?

44:56.494 --> 44:58.561
I'm fucking losing my mind.

44:59.730 --> 45:01.297
What did you see, Ade?

45:01.299 --> 45:03.065
What did you see at the house?

45:03.067 --> 45:04.500
Did you find the parents?

45:04.502 --> 45:06.769
Oh, yeah. I found them, alright.

45:06.771 --> 45:09.105
- Good.
- Dead.

45:09.107 --> 45:10.406
Dead?

45:12.075 --> 45:14.343
Sorry, is there a fucking echo in here?

45:14.345 --> 45:16.679
So we're not getting the diamonds.

45:18.782 --> 45:21.684
No, all this means is
that the game's changed.

45:21.686 --> 45:24.720
Changed? No. No, no, no.
You don't fucking get it.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.622
Alright, there's no game anymore!

45:26.624 --> 45:28.424
This is now survival 101, alright?

45:28.426 --> 45:29.592
I don't care about the score.

45:29.594 --> 45:31.694
It's not about the fucking jail time.

45:31.696 --> 45:34.197
This is life or death.

45:34.199 --> 45:36.265
Get it?

45:36.267 --> 45:37.767
Something fucking wrong
happened in that house

45:37.769 --> 45:40.303
and we brought it back here

45:40.305 --> 45:43.339
and locked it in the fucking basement.

45:43.341 --> 45:45.508
Are you saying that she killed them?

45:48.612 --> 45:50.680
They weren't the only bodies we found.

45:52.216 --> 45:54.584
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

45:56.587 --> 45:59.288
James said he found
priests in the basement

45:59.290 --> 46:00.890
for an exorcism.

46:02.926 --> 46:04.794
Like fucking human pin cushions

46:04.796 --> 46:07.663
there... there were garden tools
sticking out of them.

46:09.666 --> 46:11.634
So to answer your question

46:11.636 --> 46:14.170
I don't fucking know if she killed them.

46:14.172 --> 46:16.706
But I do know she survived
a hell of a lot longer

46:16.708 --> 46:18.774
in that house than anyone else.

46:20.777 --> 46:22.845
Okay, so what the hell happened?

46:26.617 --> 46:27.984
Let's find out.

46:34.258 --> 46:36.559
So whatever's on this tape,
we need to stick together

46:36.561 --> 46:38.628
find a way out of this, okay?

46:39.730 --> 46:41.797
It's not gonna change anything.

46:42.399 --> 46:43.599
Play it.

46:59.917 --> 47:03.152
I think I messed up big time.

47:04.721 --> 47:09.892
I found this, this sign in the basement.

47:14.865 --> 47:17.934
It turns out that this house has a

47:17.936 --> 47:19.902
a strange history of deaths

47:19.904 --> 47:22.305
dating back to the early 1900s.

47:23.740 --> 47:26.876
There was even a church
investigation in the 1920s.

47:26.878 --> 47:31.447
In 1941, Mary Ellison
and her grandson, Bradley

47:31.449 --> 47:33.516
moved into the Willow street house.

47:35.619 --> 47:37.920
Two weeks later, she kills him..

47:39.356 --> 47:41.157
...by taking a cheese grater to his throat

47:41.159 --> 47:42.792
while giving him a bath.

47:44.461 --> 47:48.631
Don and Sam Forbes move in with
their two kids in the 1960s.

47:48.633 --> 47:51.534
He comes home one night
after visiting his mistress

47:51.536 --> 47:55.504
to find his wife gauging out her eyeballs.

47:55.506 --> 47:57.306
Their two kids peacefully in bed

47:57.308 --> 47:59.909
poisoned with drain cleaner.

47:59.911 --> 48:03.012
The next notable case
is Mary and John Davies

48:03.014 --> 48:04.880
and their kid, Hazel.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.415
There's no remaining photos.

48:07.584 --> 48:10.720
John Davies was
my father's business partner.

48:12.622 --> 48:15.291
A fire rips through the house

48:15.293 --> 48:17.560
killing everyone except Hazel.

48:18.628 --> 48:21.530
Sounds nuts, right? Just wait.

48:23.533 --> 48:24.667
Wait, what the hell?

48:24.669 --> 48:26.936
You lived in that house?

48:26.938 --> 48:29.905
Jesus Christ. That's how
you knew about the diamonds.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.874
After my parents died, Katherine's dad

48:31.876 --> 48:33.209
took over the diamond business.

48:33.211 --> 48:34.977
Moved into that house, my house

48:34.979 --> 48:37.213
and before I knew it, I was on welfare.

48:37.215 --> 48:38.881
That's the story. Let's move on.

48:38.883 --> 48:40.049
So this is personal.

48:40.051 --> 48:42.718
It doesn't matter how they were chosen.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.320
They fitted what we were looking for.

48:44.322 --> 48:46.555
Isolated house, single daughter, wealth.

48:46.557 --> 48:47.990
These are parameters
that you guys came up with.

48:47.992 --> 48:50.259
- Then why didn't you tell us?
- I did.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.560
I told you I knew about the house.

48:51.562 --> 48:53.162
Everything else is irrelevant.

48:53.164 --> 48:55.498
Now please, keep playing the tape.

48:59.202 --> 49:01.003
Mary Ellison lost her son

49:01.005 --> 49:03.472
Bradley's father in the first world war.

49:04.574 --> 49:07.009
Don Forbes was grieving the loss

49:07.011 --> 49:10.212
of their third and youngest son Carl.

49:10.214 --> 49:12.848
John Davies moved here with his family

49:12.850 --> 49:15.351
after his brother
was killed in a diamond heist.

49:17.888 --> 49:19.855
I know this sounds crazy

49:19.857 --> 49:23.059
but if you're watching this,
I need you to believe me.

49:26.029 --> 49:30.199
If you move into this house
and you're grieving

49:30.201 --> 49:32.435
you're in for a pretty bad time.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.541
The curse of Tranguul.

49:40.610 --> 49:42.878
Devourer of tormented souls.

49:49.419 --> 49:51.554
So what's tormenting me?

49:55.325 --> 49:57.893
I had this taken out of me three weeks ago.

50:01.398 --> 50:03.599
I haven't told anybody. Nobody knows.

50:05.903 --> 50:09.171
Katherine, are you okay in there?

50:09.173 --> 50:11.373
So this happened in the last six weeks.

50:11.375 --> 50:13.142
Completely predictable, huh?

50:14.578 --> 50:16.712
What else is there?

50:20.517 --> 50:21.650
I wish I could

50:21.652 --> 50:24.653
I wish I could tell you
what it sounds like.

50:24.655 --> 50:26.689
You know when you, when you think a thought

50:26.691 --> 50:29.558
in your head and you hear your own voice?

50:29.560 --> 50:32.528
Well, I'm not... not hearing
my own voice anymore.

50:32.530 --> 50:36.132
It's, it's something else.

50:36.134 --> 50:39.935
It's telling me what to do and..

50:39.937 --> 50:42.771
And -and the worst part is

50:42.773 --> 50:45.441
I wanna do what it tells me.

50:49.813 --> 50:51.080
That's the end of the tape.

50:51.082 --> 50:54.583
He comes in my dreams.

50:59.857 --> 51:03.559
Darkest night with taunting screams.

51:06.663 --> 51:09.431
He comes and won't let me dream.

51:14.871 --> 51:19.175
And all they do is scream and scream.

51:25.682 --> 51:27.683
Here, try this one.

51:37.394 --> 51:40.029
We don't have a lot of time for questions.

51:40.031 --> 51:41.730
Now you know that girl in there

51:41.732 --> 51:44.867
is not your little girl
anymore, so be quick.

51:44.869 --> 51:46.468
Time is against us.

51:46.470 --> 51:49.405
Why our little girl? Why this house?

51:49.407 --> 51:53.108
The oldest, most complete
manuscript from the Bible

51:53.110 --> 51:55.644
the "codex vaticanus"

51:55.646 --> 51:58.080
is kept in the Vatican library in Rome.

51:59.282 --> 52:02.751
This manuscript is said to be
authored by god himself.

52:02.753 --> 52:04.787
Not like other religions or scriptures

52:04.789 --> 52:06.956
not written by scholars or prophets.

52:06.958 --> 52:08.991
Written by god.

52:10.660 --> 52:14.096
You understand the weight
of that statement?

52:15.699 --> 52:18.033
Now we find a lot of demonic activity

52:18.035 --> 52:21.637
along this line of latitude
almost as an insult.

52:21.639 --> 52:24.573
A mocking gesture towards the spirit.

52:26.042 --> 52:29.778
Now imagine a spiritual force field

52:29.780 --> 52:32.081
that gets weaker and weaker

52:32.083 --> 52:35.017
the further you get from the manuscript.

52:35.019 --> 52:36.952
Your house lies here.

52:38.054 --> 52:40.122
The furthest place on the planet

52:40.124 --> 52:42.091
from the "codex vaticanus."

52:57.407 --> 52:59.775
We need somewhere quiet to tie her down.

53:01.044 --> 53:03.045
Hold her down. Hold her down.

53:15.558 --> 53:18.527
Untie me! Let me go!

53:18.529 --> 53:20.129
Let me go!

53:20.131 --> 53:23.499
Mom! Mom, please.

53:24.734 --> 53:27.136
Dad, please.

53:29.907 --> 53:31.874
You know what we have to do.

53:31.876 --> 53:34.043
You know our only job, only mission

53:34.045 --> 53:36.312
is to make sure that he doesn't
walk or crawl out of hell.

53:36.314 --> 53:37.846
Okay, that's what we get paid to do.

53:37.848 --> 53:41.050
I'm sorry, but Tranguul
is a leach on Katherine's soul.

53:41.052 --> 53:42.751
It's become one with her.

53:42.753 --> 53:44.620
You know we're not gonna
be able to do anything

53:44.622 --> 53:45.888
to separate one from the other.

53:45.890 --> 53:47.556
What does it want?

53:47.558 --> 53:50.025
This demon

53:50.027 --> 53:52.761
this Tranguul

53:52.763 --> 53:55.597
it brings your worst nightmares to life.

53:55.599 --> 53:59.168
And through that vulnerability,
possesses you.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.240
It wants to manifest in true form.

54:06.643 --> 54:08.143
True form?

54:09.879 --> 54:13.415
It needs a total of four
living souls to consume

54:13.417 --> 54:14.917
and then it'll walk the earth.

54:14.919 --> 54:18.420
Four souls, one for each corner of hell

54:18.422 --> 54:19.888
where it's trapped.

54:19.890 --> 54:22.358
After that, it's unchained
from its suffering

54:22.360 --> 54:25.327
and it's free to walk the earth.

54:25.329 --> 54:27.396
Well, how do we beat it?

54:37.273 --> 54:39.108
The only way..

54:40.110 --> 54:42.811
...is to burn the first possessed.

54:45.149 --> 54:47.649
This is a very powerful spirit.

54:48.785 --> 54:50.686
We cannot let it consume more souls

54:50.688 --> 54:52.488
and it will do anything to survive.

54:52.490 --> 54:55.391
The more souls it takes,
the stronger it gets.

54:55.393 --> 54:58.794
We're dealing with one
possession here with Katherine.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.463
Tranguul's spirit will double in intensity

55:01.465 --> 55:02.931
for each soul he collects.

55:02.933 --> 55:04.967
We cannot let that happen.

55:07.103 --> 55:08.804
He'll be unstoppable.

55:15.211 --> 55:16.945
This is too much! You're killing her!

55:16.947 --> 55:19.047
- Hold him back!
- You gotta stop!

55:19.049 --> 55:20.349
You're killing her!

55:20.351 --> 55:22.251
You've gotta stop this right now!

55:22.253 --> 55:24.520
We're not fighting for her body anymore!

55:24.522 --> 55:27.423
We kill her now or this thing
will take us all!

55:27.425 --> 55:29.758
- Stop!
- Get off me!

55:38.968 --> 55:40.836
Please, stop.

56:42.232 --> 56:45.467
Come, let's get you to bed.

56:46.836 --> 56:49.271
We'll be getting visitors soon.

56:54.844 --> 56:56.044
Oh, shit.

56:56.046 --> 56:57.679
I say we get the fuck out of here.

56:57.681 --> 56:59.281
You saw the tapes, what the priest said.

56:59.283 --> 57:01.116
That thing's gonna possess us all.

57:01.118 --> 57:03.952
And then what? What comes next?

57:03.954 --> 57:06.488
We're all tormented souls.
We're all mourning someone.

57:06.490 --> 57:08.557
We're fucked if we stay here.

57:09.526 --> 57:10.692
What about Katherine?

57:10.694 --> 57:12.127
What about Katherine?

57:12.129 --> 57:14.796
She's the last person that
we need to be worried about.

57:14.798 --> 57:16.298
I say we pack our shit
and get the fuck out of here.

57:16.300 --> 57:18.534
But there's still a girl
trapped inside there.

57:20.637 --> 57:21.703
Then we do this.

57:21.705 --> 57:22.938
We leave her here

57:22.940 --> 57:24.439
and then when we're a safe distance away

57:24.441 --> 57:25.941
we call the cops.

57:25.943 --> 57:28.110
Make it their problem.

57:28.112 --> 57:30.012
Yeah, he's onto something.

57:30.014 --> 57:31.813
Let them call the priest
or wait for the second coming

57:31.815 --> 57:33.348
or whatever, fuck it.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.218
Yeah, okay.

57:41.257 --> 57:43.158
James!

57:43.160 --> 57:45.327
James!

57:51.100 --> 57:52.734
He's gone.

57:58.141 --> 58:00.208
Well, there's only one way out of here.

58:23.900 --> 58:25.667
Whoa! Whoa!

58:41.117 --> 58:42.818
Jesus Christ!

58:49.759 --> 58:52.361
It's her! She's doing this!

59:07.744 --> 59:08.744
Fuck this shit.

59:08.746 --> 59:10.312
You better know where you stand with us.

59:10.314 --> 59:12.180
I swear to god if you don't leave us alone

59:12.182 --> 59:14.983
I will blow your fucking face off!

59:14.985 --> 59:16.752
There's no escaping.

59:18.788 --> 59:20.155
There's no running.

59:21.424 --> 59:23.191
You must just accept it.

59:24.160 --> 59:26.762
Your souls are mine.

59:26.764 --> 59:28.296
Holy shit.

59:40.978 --> 59:42.411
Move, Hazel! Find the others!

59:42.413 --> 59:43.845
Go, go, go, go!

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:17.212
If I possess you, Mark

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.347
you go to hell forever.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.150
I know you wanna see your daughter again.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:26.822
You wanna make a deal
with the devil, Marky?

01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:28.390
I need two more souls.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.625
You give me Hazel and the kid

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.328
and I promise you walk away free.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:01.523
Georgie! Holy shit.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.326
Look, man.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.129
What happened to us was
just a, just a shit situation.

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:09.364
Just bad fucking luck, alright?

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.969
I woke up from that car crash
and you were already dead!

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.941
There was nothing I could do.

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:22.244
I moved your fat fucking body

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:23.745
to make it look like you were driving.

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:27.082
So fucking what? So fucking what?

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:28.750
Hazel.

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.556
Ade?

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.530
Hazel.

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:48.403
Now the fucking cops know everything, man.

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:50.138
They fucking know everything.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.843
I'm out on bail right now awaiting a trial.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:56.711
I'm fucked. Fucked!

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.446
I'm so sorry.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.051
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.441
James!

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.335
Cuz?

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.905
Ade!

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:30.999
No! No!

01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:58.626
Fuck!

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.508
Ade.

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.878
He was gonna kill me.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:23.451
Come on. Let's find Mark
and get the fuck out of here.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.065
Oh, Jesus.

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:38.466
Where is she?

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.438
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Hey, hey. Look at me.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.440
Look at me. Look at me.

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:49.377
When we get out of here,
just you and me in Panama.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.947
We start a new life together.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.816
Yeah, I don't wanna run anymore.

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:57.085
I'm tired of always being on the move.

01:05:57.087 --> 01:05:59.320
- Get your hands on the desk.
- Mark.

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:00.422
Get your hands on the fucking desk.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:01.556
Mark, dude, what are you doing?

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:03.024
Get your hands on the fucking desk...

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:05.326
- Mark, please. Fuck.
- Now! Now!

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:11.399
Don't you get it? There is no out of this.

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:30.018
You motherfucker.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:33.521
You stay the fuck down.

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:39.027
Where the fuck are you?

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:42.697
Shit.

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:57.846
Holy shit.

01:06:58.747 --> 01:07:01.449
No. No. No.

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:05.420
- Katherine.
- She can't be saved!

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:07.655
Mark, what are you doing?

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.424
Only one of us gets out.

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.293
Bullshit, that thing will kill you

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:14.028
the first chance it gets.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:17.565
I brought you them.

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:19.534
Hazel has the keys. You have your souls.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.603
I get to see my daughter again.

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:25.607
Oh, fuck!

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.209
Fuck!

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.410
Come on, she's like your sister.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:31.146
Please, we need to do this together.

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:32.947
You leave us in here, then...
then you've sold your soul.

01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:35.116
There is no going back from this, Mark.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.754
- Down! You get down!
- Alright! Alright!

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:44.492
You unlock her. You unlock her now!

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:47.362
You wanna do this? You do it yourself!

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:03.077
- No, Mark, don't! Don't!
- Mark, come on.

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.150
I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:11.352
Oh, my god.

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:13.288
Mark, what have you done?

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:15.590
What have you done?

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:29.103
Oh, shit! Stay the fuck away from me.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:33.041
Mark! Please! Help him!

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.885
Oh, my god.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.386
Mark, what have you done?

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:55.330
Mark, you son of a bitch!

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.733
Oh, Mark!

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.861
Go!

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:30.231
Move! Get out!

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.770
Come on.

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.537
Go, haze. I got this.

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:41.876
Haze, you gotta go! Please!

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.711
Come on.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:49.484
Wait! Wait! We gotta go back for him.

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:50.885
Come on!

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.020
Come on! Quickly, come on!

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.969
Let's move it.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:18.313
Quick! Go, go!

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.084
Come on!

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:24.686
Come on, we need to move.

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:26.020
Where?

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:44.138
Come on. Follow me. Come on, let's go.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.753
Here. Here.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.195
Oh, fuck. It's jammed.

01:11:07.197 --> 01:11:08.563
Move.

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:14.535
Ugh! Come on!

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:20.575
Oh, fuck.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.313
Oh, shit.

01:12:38.086 --> 01:12:40.788
Hazel, come on!

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.857
Move it! Come on, quickly!

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.270
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:12:56.272 --> 01:12:58.239
- Mark was right.
- No! Come on!

01:12:58.241 --> 01:12:59.740
Come on. What do you mean?

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:00.942
Only one of us can get out.

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:04.111
Ade! No! Ade!

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.947
All you can do is run, Hazel.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.601
Oh, fuck.

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:31.639
No! Ade!

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:35.676
No! Ade, no! Ade, no.

01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:38.179
No, damn it!

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:41.649
- Come, come.
- Ade! Ade!

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.155
No, no.

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:56.657
Oh, fuck. Oh!

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:26.854
Fuck.

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:14.835
Oh, fuck!

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.561
No!

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:48.616
Oh, shit.

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.250
Come on.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.620
Burn in hell, you bitch.
