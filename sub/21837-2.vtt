00:00.140 --> 00:01.746
_

00:01.772 --> 00:04.210
- I'd like us to stay friends.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

00:04.735 --> 00:06.914
Would you like to go
for a drink sometime?

00:06.939 --> 00:08.000
Sure, yeah.

00:08.026 --> 00:09.856
- I had a really good night.
- Me, too.

00:09.882 --> 00:11.494
I didn't want to sleep with him.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.862
We're from the Sexual
Offences Investigation Team.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.047
And I'm arresting you for rape.

00:15.073 --> 00:18.334
If I thought she didn't want to
sleep with me, I'd not have done it.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.519
- I said no!
- No, you didn't.

00:20.545 --> 00:22.665
- I love you, Katy.
- Stop, she's my little sister.

00:22.691 --> 00:25.174
We're a mistake, Tom. I can't do this.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.268
<i>Every colleague, every friend,
every member of his family.</i>

00:28.294 --> 00:29.494
Now they know.

00:40.044 --> 00:43.012
Nothing like a six-hour operation
to get you in the mood for a pint.

00:43.038 --> 00:44.093
Fancy one?

00:44.738 --> 00:46.616
You know what? I've got to get home.

00:46.770 --> 00:49.087
- I'm fine, thanks.
- You sure?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.303
Why?

00:51.702 --> 00:53.910
Cos yesterday, two detectives
came to talk to you

00:53.936 --> 00:55.222
and you vanished the rest of the day.

00:55.749 --> 00:58.053
I thought a cold beer and yours
truly might be what you need.

00:58.554 --> 00:59.806
It's nothing.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.321
Nothing interesting, anyway.

01:02.571 --> 01:04.882
- Maybe next time, eh?
- Of course.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.960
Luke?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.443
Finally. I've been trying
to get hold of you for ages.

01:18.656 --> 01:21.127
<i>Sorry, mate, I was in surgery.
Everything all right?</i>

01:21.359 --> 01:22.439
No.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.920
Not really. You should probably
see this for yourself.

01:26.551 --> 01:30.320
- See what she's saying about you, Dad.
- What are you saying, Luke?

01:30.469 --> 01:33.029
Miss Nielson. She's written something.

01:33.562 --> 01:34.979
Online.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.160
She said that you raped her.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.079
- What?
- <i>Why would she say that?</i>

01:41.806 --> 01:43.859
<i>People are sharing it. It's everywhere.</i>

01:47.158 --> 01:49.533
_

01:52.224 --> 01:54.243
_

01:57.270 --> 01:58.498
<i>Dad?</i>

02:10.793 --> 02:11.826
<i>Dad?</i>

02:11.964 --> 02:15.827
Luke, I want you to turn that off,
OK? I'm coming home now.

02:15.853 --> 02:17.618
<i>Whatever she's saying, she's lying.</i>

02:21.200 --> 02:23.138
_

02:33.731 --> 02:35.010
Is she OK?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.714
No, not really.

02:38.115 --> 02:39.847
Have you spoken to her about it?

02:40.037 --> 02:41.240
Yeah.

02:42.834 --> 02:45.209
I told her it wasn't a good idea, but...

02:45.589 --> 02:47.426
she's angry, you know.

02:48.041 --> 02:50.854
She wants to do something,
tell the world.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.200
Yeah, well, she's definitely done that.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.583
I mean, everyone has seen that post.

02:55.811 --> 02:57.811
All her friends, her colleagues...

02:59.600 --> 03:01.672
I just wish I knew
the right thing to say.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.950
There's nothing you can say.

03:05.744 --> 03:07.478
We just have to be there for her.

03:30.598 --> 03:31.810
<i>Hello?</i>

03:32.872 --> 03:34.360
You're not allowed to call me.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.998
I saw what you wrote.

03:36.213 --> 03:37.255
<i>Yeah?</i>

03:37.295 --> 03:40.171
You think you can
say this shit about me,

03:40.257 --> 03:43.574
publicly blacken my name
and expect me to roll over?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.943
<i>How dare you?</i>

03:45.491 --> 03:49.062
You think you can do what you did
and think I'm just gonna keep quiet?

03:49.103 --> 03:52.066
You think I'm just gonna not fight
back, like a good little girl?

03:52.092 --> 03:53.612
This is my life!

03:53.638 --> 03:55.411
<i>Yeah, and this is my body!</i>

03:55.779 --> 03:58.139
My family can see that post!

03:58.320 --> 04:01.800
<i>My son, he was the one that called
me about it! For God's sake!</i>

04:01.840 --> 04:03.200
So now he knows.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.527
Knows what? What does he know?

04:05.553 --> 04:08.974
I remember what happened!
You switched the wine glasses.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.447
For God's sake!

04:10.473 --> 04:13.153
You put something in my drink
and when you were finished,

04:13.179 --> 04:15.819
you put the glasses in a dishwasher
to hide what you'd done.

04:15.845 --> 04:17.968
- <i>No...</i>
- Yes, that's exactly what...

04:17.994 --> 04:20.475
You came back in the room
and picked up my glass.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.294
You picked it up by accident
and took a sip out of it.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.540
I didn't say anything cos I didn't
want you to feel embarrassed.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.054
I liked you so I kept quiet.

04:28.080 --> 04:32.280
And I put the glasses in the
dishwasher to be helpful, nice!

04:32.320 --> 04:35.680
That's not what happened.
You know that's not what happened.

04:35.706 --> 04:38.960
Really? Honestly?
Are you so sure about this?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.997
You know what you did
and you don't just get to walk away.

04:42.023 --> 04:44.563
You have to answer for what you've done.

04:44.589 --> 04:47.960
What do you mean, "answer for what
I've done"? I haven't done anything!

05:22.800 --> 05:24.920
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my God. Oh, I can't look.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.073
It makes my skin crawl.

05:27.749 --> 05:29.665
People holding broken glass, I just...

05:29.691 --> 05:33.291
I keep thinking they're gonna cut
themselves and bleed all over.

05:34.137 --> 05:36.177
It's probably not an issue for you.

05:36.656 --> 05:39.864
Well, I kind of prefer it when my
patients don't bleed all over.

05:44.015 --> 05:47.754
What about you? You must have
things that make you squirm?

05:48.418 --> 05:50.622
No. Sorry to disappoint.

05:50.648 --> 05:52.494
- I er...
- Honestly?

05:52.920 --> 05:56.560
Scout's honour. What about you,
what scares you the most?

05:57.194 --> 05:59.194
Oh, erm...

05:59.680 --> 06:01.680
Er... burglars.

06:02.038 --> 06:04.320
Yeah, ever since I was a child
and even now,

06:04.360 --> 06:05.943
I still have three locks on my door.

06:05.969 --> 06:07.569
I know exactly what you mean.

06:08.825 --> 06:11.225
When my wife died and it
was just me and Luke,

06:11.640 --> 06:15.312
any noise, I would double-lock
and chain the front door.

06:15.474 --> 06:20.613
But I still leave the key
outside the front door,

06:20.639 --> 06:24.959
under this God-ugly garden gnome
my wife got me for Christmas,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.228
just like I always have,
just like I always will.

06:28.146 --> 06:30.338
There's no logic to any of it,
really, is there?

06:32.923 --> 06:35.243
Erm... another glass?

06:35.440 --> 06:37.440
Yeah, why not?

06:40.092 --> 06:41.457
Thanks.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.418
<i>This is Tom's phone. Leave a
message and I'll get back to you.</i>

07:03.730 --> 07:05.730
Tom, it's me.

07:06.130 --> 07:08.479
Sorry about the other day.

07:09.431 --> 07:13.111
Anyway, I was just wondering
if you had looked into Laura's case.

07:13.228 --> 07:15.228
She really needs help and...

07:15.915 --> 07:17.960
the police don't seem
to be doing anything.

07:18.342 --> 07:20.766
So, whatever you can do.

07:22.078 --> 07:23.539
Call me.

07:27.002 --> 07:28.414
No, don't.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.440
Sorry, don't... don't call me.

07:30.796 --> 07:32.201
I shouldn't have...

07:33.640 --> 07:35.640
This isn't right, it's not fair.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.055
This isn't easy, is it?

07:39.680 --> 07:41.320
Sorry.

07:43.034 --> 07:44.574
That means he...

07:44.840 --> 07:46.840
He's the smallest one in class.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.960
Yeah. And how old will he be next...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.560
- What comes after one?
- Er... two.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.920
Then he'll be four and then five
and then six and then 100...

07:59.400 --> 08:02.520
100? Slow down! That was too much!

08:02.560 --> 08:03.840
Morning.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.401
Hey, you.

08:06.984 --> 08:08.720
Father of the year, yeah?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.934
I'll go and sort breakfast out
in a minute.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.720
What did I do to deserve that?

08:21.875 --> 08:23.155
I love you.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.360
I love you too.

08:26.871 --> 08:28.788
I'll go and make us some coffee.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.440
And I'll start the breakfast.

08:33.485 --> 08:35.485
That one said, "Good boy."

08:35.760 --> 08:38.080
And Rick, he said that.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.760
<i>Hey, you've reached Katy.
Leave a message.</i>

08:43.799 --> 08:45.007
Katy.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.656
Sorry, I... I missed your call.

08:48.836 --> 08:52.294
Yeah, listen, I found something
on Andrew Earlham.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.920
Might help, might not.

08:55.241 --> 08:57.361
But I just thought you'd want to know.

08:58.289 --> 08:59.750
And...

09:00.777 --> 09:02.223
I miss you.

09:08.951 --> 09:11.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.062
How did you sleep?

09:15.360 --> 09:16.926
Oh, er...

09:17.280 --> 09:18.680
You know.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.959
Coffee?

09:21.496 --> 09:23.359
Yeah, please.

09:24.949 --> 09:28.080
So, erm... you've seen...

09:28.106 --> 09:29.226
Seen what?

09:29.400 --> 09:31.173
Your post.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.188
It keeps getting shared.

09:34.772 --> 09:38.679
10,000 already.

09:40.686 --> 09:42.246
Do the police know about this?

09:42.486 --> 09:44.946
What difference does it make?
Everything I've said's true.

09:44.972 --> 09:46.680
I know. I'm just asking.

09:47.025 --> 09:49.520
When they came over, they picked
holes in everything I told them,

09:49.560 --> 09:50.734
like I'm the one in the wrong.

09:50.833 --> 09:54.193
I wanted to do something, I wanted
people to know what he's done.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.300
And now they do.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.181
Not just the people at work,

09:58.379 --> 10:02.299
but thousands and thousands of
strangers all with a bloody opinion.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.258
- Why, what are they saying?
- It doesn't matter. They're...

10:06.252 --> 10:09.776
Ignore them, it's just...
All I'm saying is,

10:09.802 --> 10:12.120
there's a reason why people remain
anonymous in these cases.

10:12.146 --> 10:13.603
What about your privacy?

10:14.271 --> 10:16.280
I've got nothing to be
embarrassed about.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.132
I'm just worried about you.

10:18.832 --> 10:21.522
What if this gets
in the way of the case?

10:32.360 --> 10:34.440
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

10:34.878 --> 10:36.162
It's just...

10:36.191 --> 10:37.429
Now...

10:38.461 --> 10:41.157
Now people are gonna make it
about you and him and...

10:42.089 --> 10:44.889
..your whole life,
everything you've ever done.

10:45.279 --> 10:47.840
It's all gonna come out now.

10:50.077 --> 10:51.605
Are you ready for that?

11:00.607 --> 11:01.857
Back later, Dad.

11:02.030 --> 11:04.030
Luke, come here a minute, will you?

11:04.488 --> 11:05.957
I'm gonna be late to meet my friends.

11:05.983 --> 11:09.568
I won't keep you long. Look, these er...

11:10.253 --> 11:12.763
..things, the things
that Miss Nielson's said.

11:12.789 --> 11:16.298
- Dad, we don't have to do this.
- You know they're not true, right?

11:16.597 --> 11:18.183
Yeah, of course.

11:18.738 --> 11:21.043
- Come here a minute, sit down.
- I was gonna go out.

11:21.069 --> 11:22.517
It's important.

11:28.842 --> 11:31.626
People, they... they start rumours.

11:31.652 --> 11:34.932
They say nasty things because
they're confused or upset.

11:35.691 --> 11:39.072
And if they say it loud enough,
it starts to spread.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.670
- I can make up my own mind.
- I know you can. I know you can.

11:41.710 --> 11:45.585
But... you're gonna start
hearing things about me.

11:45.611 --> 11:48.258
So you should know
exactly what happened.

11:48.284 --> 11:50.284
- Oh, Dad...
- No, no, listen, please.

11:50.512 --> 11:52.512
It's important, all right?

11:55.897 --> 11:57.390
We went out for a drink.

11:58.377 --> 12:00.226
We had a lovely time.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.567
She invited me back to hers.

12:03.171 --> 12:04.921
We had a glass of wine.

12:05.962 --> 12:07.476
And we slept together.

12:10.113 --> 12:12.430
She's the first woman
since your mum that I...

12:13.443 --> 12:15.257
really liked.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.610
Then I came home.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.363
And that's it.

12:19.931 --> 12:23.257
Then out of the blue, the next day,
she says I took advantage of her.

12:23.725 --> 12:28.341
And you need to know that is
absolutely not what happened.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.801
At no point did she ask me to stop.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.069
And that's the truth.

12:39.513 --> 12:43.055
I'm not the best dad.
I'm not always there, I know.

12:44.370 --> 12:46.153
But I wouldn't lie to you, Luke.

12:47.772 --> 12:50.190
I don't understand why
she would say something like that.

12:50.230 --> 12:54.535
I don't know, either.
She's confused or upset.

12:55.064 --> 13:00.041
When people are in a strange place in
their lives, they do stupid things.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.053
They don't think properly.

13:03.446 --> 13:04.726
Look...

13:05.014 --> 13:07.014
it'll all work itself out.

13:08.809 --> 13:11.129
The truth always
shows itself in the end.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.842
Yeah, I guess so.

13:17.384 --> 13:19.230
And you do believe me, don't you?

13:20.962 --> 13:23.426
You believe that I couldn't
do something like that?

13:23.547 --> 13:25.907
Yeah. Of course I do.

13:27.128 --> 13:28.662
Thanks, mate.

13:29.070 --> 13:30.750
Come here.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.522
I love you, mate.

13:44.393 --> 13:47.199

13:53.850 --> 13:55.291

13:57.709 --> 14:00.164
_

14:04.830 --> 14:06.837
- Laura, we're going to the park.
- _

14:07.466 --> 14:09.135
Do you want to come?

14:11.390 --> 14:14.523
Laura? Laura?

14:14.625 --> 14:15.882
Are you coming?

14:15.908 --> 14:17.331
Erm...

14:18.803 --> 14:21.710
Actually, you know, I think I just
want to be on my own for a bit.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.750
So just go on ahead.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.475
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

14:25.501 --> 14:26.501
Yeah.

14:26.958 --> 14:28.958
OK. Well, we won't be long.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.030
Miss Nielson, hi.

15:40.262 --> 15:41.868
How can we help you?

15:44.004 --> 15:47.439
I... I want to know what's
going on with the investigation.

15:47.465 --> 15:50.256
- Yeah, sure.
- We're still gathering the evidence,

15:50.282 --> 15:51.913
making sure we haven't missed anything

15:51.939 --> 15:53.946
before we take it to the CPS.

15:53.972 --> 15:55.415
What about the wine glasses?

15:55.441 --> 15:57.910
Yeah, they were washed.
Came back with nothing.

15:58.714 --> 16:01.034
Trust us, we're doing everything we can.

16:02.601 --> 16:05.799
OK, cos if he planned this,
then presumably he...

16:06.490 --> 16:09.054
he had to get hold of the drugs
from somewhere, so...

16:09.210 --> 16:12.096
If they're in his house,
you should be searching his house.

16:12.122 --> 16:13.104
We'd need a warrant.

16:13.130 --> 16:15.470
- And to get a warrant, we need a reason.
- Mm-hm.

16:15.510 --> 16:17.280
I just gave you a reason.

16:18.249 --> 16:20.597
Why don't you take a seat
for a minute, Miss Nielson?

16:27.656 --> 16:30.165
I'm afraid we're gonna need
more than your word...

16:30.946 --> 16:32.510
a dealer who says they helped him,

16:32.550 --> 16:35.085
or somebody from the hospital
who found some drugs missing.

16:36.349 --> 16:39.990
I'm sorry, I know this is frustrating.
But these things do take time.

16:40.030 --> 16:42.031
That's what I'm afraid of, time...

16:42.057 --> 16:45.063
for him to firm up
his side of the story,

16:45.495 --> 16:47.958
time for him to hide evidence.

16:49.315 --> 16:52.863
Maybe you should think about
going to see somebody again.

16:53.176 --> 16:55.177
We can recommend some
excellent counsellors.

16:55.203 --> 16:58.688
I don't need to go and see
a counsellor. I'm fine.

16:58.807 --> 17:00.089
Are you sure?

17:00.464 --> 17:01.987
What's that supposed to mean?

17:02.060 --> 17:04.247
We saw your post online.

17:06.251 --> 17:07.301
And?

17:07.328 --> 17:10.876
And, well, it could have
an impact on your case.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.630
If a witness saw it, then
had to testify in court...

17:13.670 --> 17:15.029
For God's sake!

17:17.926 --> 17:20.150
Look, why don't you sit down?
We'll talk it through.

17:20.175 --> 17:21.723
I'll explain exactly what it...

17:21.749 --> 17:25.219
Sitting down and talking it through
isn't gonna get us anywhere, is it?

17:51.993 --> 17:54.968
_

17:58.353 --> 18:01.615
_

18:30.885 --> 18:32.810
Wow, you see the way
Charlie's looking at you?

18:32.836 --> 18:34.476
What? What do you mean?

18:34.502 --> 18:35.710
Charlie?

18:36.020 --> 18:38.950
Never seen anyone more happy
to see the consultant arriving.

18:38.990 --> 18:41.283
Oh, right, yeah.

18:42.353 --> 18:45.110
Hi. Thanks for filling in
at such late notice, Andrew.

18:45.150 --> 18:48.750
He's ready for theatre but the blood
pressure's just dropped to 100/70.

18:48.790 --> 18:50.790
OK, let's take a look.

19:11.268 --> 19:13.183
Don't do it to yourself.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.742
I can't help it.

19:15.339 --> 19:17.785
If you listened to all the nasty
things people said online,

19:17.811 --> 19:19.653
you'd never leave the house.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.868
I don't understand how so many people...

19:24.110 --> 19:26.937
so many strangers, they think they know.

19:27.204 --> 19:29.204
How many of them are so sure I'm lying.

19:29.230 --> 19:33.749
Someone found a picture of me
from a profile on holiday.

19:34.044 --> 19:36.429
"She deserved it.
She looks like a slut."

19:36.625 --> 19:38.074
That's what they wrote.

19:38.350 --> 19:40.702
And this one.

19:40.796 --> 19:43.889
"The guy she's accusing
is so much hotter than her.

19:43.915 --> 19:45.148
She'd be so lucky."

19:45.479 --> 19:48.458
- And this one...
- Right, that's enough.

19:48.484 --> 19:50.541
You're not to look at
that shit any more.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.382
It doesn't make any difference.

19:53.705 --> 19:55.705
What chance do I have, Katy?

19:56.190 --> 19:58.971
How can I actually prove
what he did to me?

20:00.532 --> 20:02.298
Let the police do their job.

20:02.324 --> 20:04.804
- Give it time.
- I haven't got any bloody time!

20:05.392 --> 20:07.212
I want this to be over.

20:07.494 --> 20:10.390
You need to get some sleep. Things
will look different in the morning.

20:10.430 --> 20:12.075
That's what I'm worried about.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.764
Maybe you should take some time off.
Going straight back to school...

20:15.790 --> 20:19.063
I'm not hiding, Katy! I'm not
the one who should be hiding.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.369
DI Harmon, DS Maxwell?

20:33.790 --> 20:35.291
I've been trying to get hold of you.

20:35.856 --> 20:36.936
Yeah?

20:36.994 --> 20:38.898
You're investigating the
Laura Nielson case?

20:38.924 --> 20:40.023
Yeah.

20:40.086 --> 20:41.570
I'm Tom Bailey.

20:42.438 --> 20:44.314
- Miss Nielson's ex?
- Yeah.

20:44.461 --> 20:46.045
What can we do for you?

20:46.071 --> 20:49.167
I took a look into Andrew Earlham.
I found something you should know.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.790
You need to leave this to us, Constable.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.870
I know it's out of line
but I couldn't sit back,

20:53.910 --> 20:55.520
I had to do something.

20:56.441 --> 20:57.884
Mary Earlham.

20:58.261 --> 21:01.390
Andrew Earlham's wife.
She committed suicide 11 years ago.

21:01.430 --> 21:02.910
Yeah. We know. So?

21:02.950 --> 21:05.030
So, I called up the coroner's
in Edinburgh.

21:05.186 --> 21:07.666
They put me through
to a DC in Edinburgh CID.

21:07.812 --> 21:09.347
She took an overdose.

21:10.071 --> 21:12.630
The guy I spoke to investigated
her death, he remembered it.

21:13.249 --> 21:15.510
Apparently there'd been complaints,
what sounded like

21:15.550 --> 21:18.270
a domestic argument in the house
Andrew and Mary lived in.

21:18.898 --> 21:21.630
A mum called the police, she was
worried about her daughter's safety.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.399
There was a suicide note, but even so.

21:24.425 --> 21:25.848
The guy I spoke to,

21:26.160 --> 21:28.510
he had his suspicions, they just
couldn't find anything on him.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.123
What are we supposed to do with that?

21:30.884 --> 21:32.100
I don't know.

21:32.126 --> 21:34.790
I can give you the copper's number.
He got a weird vibe off Earlham.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.361
That doesn't help us.

21:37.870 --> 21:40.350
You need to look further
into what kind of guy he is.

21:40.381 --> 21:44.016
What if there was more to his wife's
death than meets the eye? What then?

21:44.713 --> 21:47.062
How are we supposed to prove in a week

21:47.088 --> 21:49.373
what the Edinburgh police
couldn't in 11 years?

21:49.399 --> 21:52.099
You do your job, we'll do ours. OK?

21:52.607 --> 21:54.327
Andrew Earlham is dangerous.

21:54.353 --> 21:56.281
This is not your case, Constable!

21:56.307 --> 21:59.295
You putting yourself in the middle
of it won't end well for you.

21:59.321 --> 22:00.588
Do you get that?

22:01.248 --> 22:02.968
Yeah, I get it.

22:22.641 --> 22:24.697
I thought you'd have swapped
your rotation.

22:24.881 --> 22:27.992
If you're uncomfortable working
with me, find another anaesthetist.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.673
Suction.

22:33.699 --> 22:35.888
Bloods are draining
faster than I'd like.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.240
How are his observations?

22:39.568 --> 22:41.568
BP's 108/76.

22:42.670 --> 22:46.304
I can't get a clear view of his
pulmonary artery. Suction?

22:46.330 --> 22:47.810
Can I help?

22:47.954 --> 22:50.080
I've done 1,000 of these.
I think I know what I'm doing.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.120
BP's falling.

22:53.158 --> 22:54.758
Did you hear me?

22:54.784 --> 22:56.271
Yes, I heard you!

22:56.798 --> 22:59.038
Bloody hell, where's that coming from?

22:59.064 --> 23:00.729
I think you might have
nicked the artery.

23:01.241 --> 23:04.171
Oh, bollocks. Yeah, I see it. OK.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.200
I'm adding another litre
to stabilise the pressure.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.500
Stitch, now.

23:08.526 --> 23:10.804
Chest cavity's filling with blood.
Should I retract?

23:10.830 --> 23:12.266
- I'll order some more blood.
- Retract?

23:12.292 --> 23:14.326
Everyone just shut up, please!

23:14.352 --> 23:17.552
So I can fix this man before
he bleeds to death! Thank you.

23:31.325 --> 23:33.325
- You shouldn't be here.
- He's fine.

23:34.073 --> 23:36.117
In case you hadn't noticed,
I've got a lot on my mind.

23:36.143 --> 23:38.143
Yeah. Guilt will do that.

24:34.056 --> 24:36.153
_

24:37.032 --> 24:38.813
Don't look at that stuff.

24:39.802 --> 24:42.427
- You sound like my sister.
- She's a smart woman.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.709
85,000 women a year
raped in the UK, this says.

24:48.464 --> 24:52.402
And only 5.7 per cent of cases
reported end in a conviction.

24:53.063 --> 24:56.076
I thought what you wrote about it
took a lot of courage.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.810
All of those people sharing it?

24:59.255 --> 25:01.442
Most of them are women who support you.

25:01.512 --> 25:04.343
We don't want men like
Andrew Earlham going unpunished.

25:05.092 --> 25:06.936
It didn't make any difference,
though, did it?

25:07.468 --> 25:09.708
All I've done is give people
something to talk about.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.325
And when they get bored
and the dust settles,

25:14.614 --> 25:16.240
he'll go home.

25:16.794 --> 25:19.186
Those people will forget and...

25:19.943 --> 25:22.754
..then he'll do it again
to someone else.

25:26.437 --> 25:29.240
- You can't think like that.
- Why?

25:29.818 --> 25:31.313
Because I'm right.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.203
You know you don't have to be here,
you know that, right?

25:35.229 --> 25:37.066
The Head will give you however
much time you need off.

25:37.092 --> 25:38.241
Yeah, right.

25:38.267 --> 25:40.571
Keep me out of sight
until it all blows over.

25:40.597 --> 25:42.415
Wouldn't want to embarrass the school.

25:42.441 --> 25:43.854
That's not what I mean.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.640
But everybody knows about it,
the staff and kids.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.508
Meanwhile, his son
is still here in your class.

25:48.534 --> 25:50.534
That can't be good for either of you.

25:50.643 --> 25:52.339
Do you really think everyone knows?

25:52.365 --> 25:55.165
Since when did anything
stay quiet in this place?

25:55.315 --> 25:57.963
So Jay Gatsby's lies

25:58.236 --> 26:01.729
are in some way a
contrast to the narrator,

26:01.995 --> 26:03.995
who tells us at the beginning...

26:05.640 --> 26:08.989
That's enough, you two!
What are you looking at?

26:09.687 --> 26:11.087
It's nothing, miss.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.713
Give it to me.

26:18.173 --> 26:20.017
You shouldn't have your phone in class.

26:20.043 --> 26:21.070
Oh, what?

26:21.096 --> 26:23.219
I'm keeping it until
the end of the lesson.

26:28.126 --> 26:29.867
As I was saying...

26:31.430 --> 26:33.925
the narrator tells us
at the beginning...

26:34.779 --> 26:37.899
"I am one of the few honest people
that I have ever known."

26:39.200 --> 26:42.449
But that in itself
isn't entirely candid.

26:42.475 --> 26:44.475
He doesn't always tell us...

26:45.080 --> 26:47.080
..everything, he...

26:49.240 --> 26:52.202
He doesn't reveal that he...

26:52.960 --> 26:55.880
..knows about the affair...

27:05.120 --> 27:06.640
Excuse me.

27:06.961 --> 27:08.820
I'm not feeling well, I'm...

27:09.173 --> 27:11.173
I'm gonna send someone in.

27:19.691 --> 27:20.711
Sorry.

27:23.405 --> 27:24.665
<i>Hi, Laura.</i>

27:24.920 --> 27:26.278
Hey, um...

27:27.295 --> 27:29.640
I just wondered
if Andrew's at work today.

27:29.719 --> 27:31.479
Er... yeah. Why?

27:31.703 --> 27:35.215
- And he's there all day?
- Erm... yeah.

27:35.241 --> 27:36.847
Why are you asking? What's going on?

27:36.971 --> 27:38.571
I just erm...

27:38.784 --> 27:41.001
- I thought I saw him.
- You shouldn't be at work.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.126
Go home.

27:42.188 --> 27:44.333
Yeah. Yeah, I think I will, actually.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.790
All right, OK.

27:45.816 --> 27:47.696
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Right. Bye.

27:51.682 --> 27:52.842
Hey.

27:52.868 --> 27:55.068
Andrew. How are you doing?

27:55.094 --> 27:56.635
Actually...

27:56.880 --> 27:59.950
Yeah, actually, not so well.

27:59.999 --> 28:01.230
Come on.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.830
You've er...

28:05.434 --> 28:08.103
probably seen this post about me online.

28:08.129 --> 28:09.845
It's none of my business.

28:09.910 --> 28:12.780
No... but it is your business now.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.690
It's everyone's business.

28:15.417 --> 28:17.256
Cos everyone thinks that's who I am now,

28:17.282 --> 28:21.154
someone who took a woman out to
dinner and forced myself on her.

28:21.180 --> 28:23.073
And I didn't, I wouldn't.

28:23.099 --> 28:28.986
Andrew... these allegations are at
present your own private business.

28:30.676 --> 28:33.709
If charges are pressed, then, yes,

28:33.764 --> 28:35.775
we will need to have a conversation.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.084
Look, if charges are pressed, I mean...

28:38.110 --> 28:39.914
that doesn't change a bloody thing.

28:39.940 --> 28:41.900
Innocent till proven guilty, right?

28:44.396 --> 28:45.640
Sorry.

28:49.262 --> 28:52.213
I let it get to me earlier
during an operation.

28:52.239 --> 28:54.597
And in this job,
you can't do that, can you?

28:54.882 --> 28:57.447
I just feel like everyone's
watching me all the time.

28:58.402 --> 29:00.532
Wondering if I'm not the person
they thought I was,

29:00.558 --> 29:02.214
wondering if I'm some kind of monster.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.277
I wanna tell them I'm not, I wanna
bloody scream it at them, but...

29:05.627 --> 29:08.707
then that would make me look
even more like one, wouldn't it?

29:13.026 --> 29:15.039
I think I should take some time off.

29:15.065 --> 29:18.462
I don't think I can work here feeling
like this, it's irresponsible.

29:18.488 --> 29:19.430
OK.

29:19.456 --> 29:21.476
With her sister working here too, I...

29:21.529 --> 29:24.894
I understand.
I'll find someone to cover.

29:25.451 --> 29:27.451
You take the time you need.

29:27.592 --> 29:29.232
Great. Thanks, Margaret.

29:33.705 --> 29:37.225
Hey, how long is it since we've
known each other now, five years?

29:37.879 --> 29:39.389
You believe me, don't you?

29:40.094 --> 29:42.998
You know what? Don't. Don't answer that.

29:50.994 --> 29:52.679
Where did you run off to?

29:52.705 --> 29:54.407
To throw up. Can you tell?

29:54.433 --> 29:56.315
- Definitely.
- Up yours.

29:56.341 --> 29:58.942
Won't be able to keep it a secret
much longer round here.

29:58.968 --> 29:59.894
I know.

30:00.453 --> 30:01.935
If it makes you feel any better,

30:01.961 --> 30:06.183
when Natalie was pregnant, she was
sick for the entire nine months.

30:06.209 --> 30:08.360
In what world is that supposed
to make me feel better?

30:08.579 --> 30:11.866
Oh, yeah, right. Oh, now, listen.

30:12.170 --> 30:15.228
Just got off the blower to Sammy at CPS.

30:15.254 --> 30:18.102
The Earlham case.
We're still short of the threshold.

30:18.425 --> 30:21.174
- They won't prosecute yet.
- Oh, bollocks.

30:21.966 --> 30:23.508
So the whole nine months?

30:23.534 --> 30:26.842
Yeah. It's pretty rubbish, actually.

30:27.258 --> 30:29.258
Thanks, Rory. You're a tosser.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.840
Shit!

34:31.060 --> 34:33.060
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:33.451 --> 34:35.034
Thanks for meeting me.

34:36.460 --> 34:38.420
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

34:38.616 --> 34:40.705
You're the last person
I should be calling.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.449
We were friends first.

34:43.659 --> 34:44.905
We still are.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.820
So what is it? The way you sounded
on the phone, you got me worried.

34:48.860 --> 34:52.579
I'm gonna tell you something
and I need you to keep it a secret.

34:53.020 --> 34:54.469
Can you do that for me?

34:54.628 --> 34:56.494
OK. Sure, yeah.

34:58.005 --> 35:00.005
I broke into his house.

35:00.426 --> 35:02.150
I broke into Andrew's house.

35:02.176 --> 35:03.580
Jesus Christ, Laura, what...

35:03.620 --> 35:06.380
I didn't literally break in,
I knew where his key was.

35:06.420 --> 35:08.420
He told me the night we went out.

35:08.460 --> 35:10.540
I was at school and I just thought...

35:12.146 --> 35:14.380
I can't wait around
like some damsel in distress,

35:14.420 --> 35:17.785
hoping someone will come and take
him away cos that doesn't happen.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.196
Letting the police do their job
is completely different.

35:20.222 --> 35:22.760
- I had to do something.
- Get yourself arrested?

35:22.855 --> 35:24.353
Where's the sense in that?

35:26.429 --> 35:28.429
What happened after you broke in?

35:29.766 --> 35:32.406
Under his bed, I found a box.

35:32.432 --> 35:36.148
And it had a clear glass tube in it,
with no medical label.

35:36.174 --> 35:37.796
And there was um...

35:37.822 --> 35:42.444
like a liquid, like a little small
amount of liquid left in the bottom,

35:42.470 --> 35:43.857
a clear liquid.

35:44.099 --> 35:47.637
GHB is a clear liquid,
if that's what he gave me.

35:47.663 --> 35:49.616
Even if it is what you think it is,

35:49.686 --> 35:50.895
so what?

35:51.335 --> 35:54.052
You took it from his house,
a house you entered illegally,

35:54.078 --> 35:55.660
and presumably left fingerprints
all over the place.

35:55.700 --> 35:58.460
- I had my sleeve pulled over my hand.
- That's all right, then!

35:58.500 --> 36:00.500
And I didn't take it,
I left it where it was.

36:00.540 --> 36:03.180
I know it can't be used as evidence
if I just steal it.

36:03.399 --> 36:07.469
But if you were to search his house
and if you were to find it,

36:07.520 --> 36:10.213
then you could have it tested.

36:10.381 --> 36:11.941
It could be used in court then.

36:13.315 --> 36:15.315
I can't just walk into his house.

36:15.561 --> 36:17.199
It'd have to be official.

36:17.529 --> 36:19.057
Get a warrant, there'd
need to be a reason.

36:19.083 --> 36:20.307
So find a reason.

36:20.572 --> 36:24.519
Please, Tom. Right now, it's my
word against his and that's it.

36:24.612 --> 36:27.475
But if I'm right about this, we
could have... we could have proof.

36:27.501 --> 36:29.260
We could make him pay
for what he's done.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.580
Isn't that why you did this job
in the first place?

36:32.026 --> 36:33.626
Tom, please.

36:33.688 --> 36:35.688
If you still care about me, please.

36:35.714 --> 36:37.394
Please help me.

36:38.583 --> 36:41.692
These tickets are impossible
to get. They sold out in 20 minutes.

36:41.718 --> 36:43.998
Someone at work managed to snap them up.

36:44.420 --> 36:46.300
You've been going on for months about

36:46.589 --> 36:48.909
how long it's been
since you went to a gig.

36:49.669 --> 36:52.580
Why do I feel like you're softening
me up for some bad news?

36:54.340 --> 36:56.340
Can't I do something nice for you?

36:56.380 --> 36:58.380
No, of course you can, it's just...

36:58.638 --> 37:01.678
It's just very thoughtful,
that's all. Come here.

37:03.580 --> 37:05.140
Thank you.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.180
Aww, thank you.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.421
Right, I'll start on these pizzas.

37:09.447 --> 37:11.185
Right, boys, what are we playing?

37:17.966 --> 37:20.623
Nige, hey, how are you doing?

37:20.711 --> 37:22.711
- I'm knackered.
- Yeah.

37:23.294 --> 37:25.294
Yeah. Listen, mate, I er...

37:26.222 --> 37:27.632
..need a favour.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.846
I need a guy's house turned over.

37:30.295 --> 37:33.538
He's got a stash of GHB
right under his bed.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.460
Why are you coming to me with this?

37:37.380 --> 37:39.922
I didn't come by the intel
in the most legit kind of way.

37:40.097 --> 37:43.060
It's solid, though.
I'm sure you can find a reason.

37:43.100 --> 37:44.792
Get one of your informants
to call in with a tip.

37:44.818 --> 37:45.715
I could.

37:45.740 --> 37:48.640
The question is, why I'd
risk my neck like that.

37:48.858 --> 37:51.058
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

37:52.798 --> 37:54.210
My ex.

37:54.508 --> 37:56.508
This guy, he raped her.

37:57.559 --> 37:59.039
He's bad news.

37:59.984 --> 38:01.780
There's gotta be a better way.

38:02.538 --> 38:04.538
Mate, I'm asking for your help.

38:05.835 --> 38:08.427
Like I said, we go way back, don't we?

38:08.553 --> 38:10.259
We've looked out for each other.

38:12.387 --> 38:15.693
Now, when you were seeing that
prostitute, I kept that quiet, didn't I?

38:17.765 --> 38:19.285
Are you blackmailing me?

38:19.311 --> 38:20.940
I was just asking for your help.

38:21.292 --> 38:22.572
That's all.

38:45.606 --> 38:47.006
Yes? What is it?

38:47.032 --> 38:49.052
- Andrew Earlham?
- That's right.

38:49.078 --> 38:50.900
We have a warrant to search your house.

38:50.940 --> 38:54.317
This is ridiculous! Why don't you
tell me what you're looking for?

38:55.057 --> 38:56.660
This is outrageous!

38:56.700 --> 38:59.649
- Dad, what's going on?
- Just get back in your room, Luke.

38:59.675 --> 39:01.620
- What's going on?
- Just get back in your room now.

39:01.660 --> 39:03.203
- No, sir, stay there.
- What?

39:03.512 --> 39:06.076
What? This is ridiculous.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.670
- I'm calling my lawyer.
- Of course, sir.

39:12.754 --> 39:15.364
Hello, it's Andrew Earlham.
I need to speak with James.

39:15.390 --> 39:17.390
Quick as you can, please. Thank you.

39:19.126 --> 39:22.047
Hi, James. I need someone over here now.

39:22.148 --> 39:24.940
The police, yeah. They're
crawling all over my house.

39:25.721 --> 39:27.515
They've got a warrant and everything.

39:27.541 --> 39:29.654
Of course, Olly starts
kicking up a tantrum.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.760
Anything his older brother's got,
he's got to have.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.260
I said to Olly, "We've only got one
and you're gonna have to share."

39:35.300 --> 39:38.300
So he turned around and
said, "I'm gonna tell Mummy."

39:49.100 --> 39:51.599
Evening. We'd like to speak to Laura.

39:51.980 --> 39:53.980
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come in.

39:55.679 --> 39:57.102
Thank you.

40:01.992 --> 40:03.760
It's the police for you, Laura.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.318
It's late.

40:08.443 --> 40:11.858
Andrew Earlham had his house
searched this evening.

40:12.228 --> 40:14.180
- About time.
- Maybe.

40:14.206 --> 40:16.686
But not by us. Drug Squad.

40:17.260 --> 40:19.580
Someone called in an anonymous tip.

40:20.195 --> 40:24.386
And then Earlham got on the phone
and gave our boss an earful.

40:24.957 --> 40:27.515
Mr Earlham thinks it might be you.

40:27.642 --> 40:30.773
He says you knew where
his front door key was.

40:31.074 --> 40:32.851
I don't know anything about this.

40:33.153 --> 40:36.118
Your ex-boyfriend, maybe he does?

40:38.066 --> 40:39.860
Was there something else you wanted?

40:39.886 --> 40:43.088
We've talked about this, Laura,
about you keeping out of our way.

40:43.189 --> 40:45.290
And I am keeping out of your way,

40:45.316 --> 40:47.415
so you can continue to do sod all.

40:47.441 --> 40:49.211
Two vehicles, six guys.

40:49.237 --> 40:51.051
That's what it took to search his house.

40:51.098 --> 40:54.425
That is a serious waste
of our resources, Laura.

40:54.451 --> 40:57.790
And if your ex-boyfriend's involved,
that's his badge.

40:57.816 --> 40:59.145
Are we finished here?

40:59.171 --> 41:01.451
Laura, please, for your own sake, stop.

41:02.881 --> 41:05.137
Right now, you're your own worst enemy.

41:06.021 --> 41:07.678
I'll call you tomorrow.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.460
Did they find anything?

41:14.503 --> 41:18.244
Only an old medical box of his
with a vial of insulin inside.

41:18.270 --> 41:20.820
Weird thing is, it'd been emptied
into another container

41:20.860 --> 41:22.275
after the old one had cracked.

41:22.301 --> 41:25.216
So, I can see how this vial,

41:25.242 --> 41:27.407
to somebody who didn't know any better,

41:27.510 --> 41:30.190
they might imagine
it could contain anything.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.271
Insulin?

41:35.900 --> 41:38.500
We both want the same
thing here, Miss Nielson.

41:39.123 --> 41:41.123
So let us do our jobs.

41:43.668 --> 41:44.877
Good night.

41:55.829 --> 41:57.069
Hey.

41:58.109 --> 42:00.109
I brought you some tea.

42:00.525 --> 42:01.956
Thanks.

42:05.468 --> 42:07.042
How are you doing?

42:10.408 --> 42:11.831
Honestly?

42:12.839 --> 42:14.390
I don't know any more.

42:18.041 --> 42:19.273
I thought...

42:20.998 --> 42:23.901
..when I wrote that post that I had
it all figured out, I thought...

42:25.820 --> 42:29.140
I thought I'd take charge,
show him he couldn't control me.

42:30.753 --> 42:33.660
You never were one to sit by
and let the world come to you.

42:34.315 --> 42:37.820
I wish I was, because now it doesn't
feel like it freed me at all.

42:37.860 --> 42:39.207
Now it just...

42:40.392 --> 42:43.512
I just feel ashamed that everyone
knows what he did to me.

42:45.213 --> 42:48.252
And everything I try and do
just turns back on me.

42:49.963 --> 42:52.706
I feel like I'm losing my mind, Katy.

42:52.732 --> 42:53.900
Aww.

42:53.940 --> 42:56.797
I'm sorry.

42:58.708 --> 43:01.181
I don't know what I'd do without you.

43:01.740 --> 43:03.580
Ssh. It's OK.

43:10.126 --> 43:11.246
Hello.

43:11.353 --> 43:13.900
Hello, my name is Dennis Walters.

43:13.940 --> 43:17.340
I hope you don't mind me calling
you out of the blue like this.

43:17.926 --> 43:19.583
<i>No. What's this about?</i>

43:20.324 --> 43:22.180
I'd like to come and see you
if that's possible.

43:22.220 --> 43:25.340
This is something
I'd rather do in person.

43:25.878 --> 43:27.700
Come on, what's this about?

43:28.107 --> 43:30.507
It's about Laura Nielson.

43:32.731 --> 43:35.158
Look, if this is about that
post that she wrote...

43:35.184 --> 43:37.184
I think I might be able to help you,
there's absolu...

43:38.059 --> 43:39.939
There's something you need to know.

43:40.645 --> 43:42.260
<i>She's done this before.</i>

43:43.073 --> 43:45.273
She's lied about something like this.

43:46.039 --> 43:49.620
<i>I'll be damned if I'll let her ruin
some other poor bastard's life.</i>

43:50.748 --> 43:52.912
Right. Look, erm...

43:53.666 --> 43:55.786
why don't I give you my address, then?

44:25.380 --> 44:26.460
<i>OK.</i>

44:27.261 --> 44:29.707
OK, great. Great, I'll see you then.
