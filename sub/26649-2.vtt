WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:07.067 --> 00:10.133
Let this motherfucking party
begin!

00:12.867 --> 00:15.200
This time we're back
where we belong.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.533
Newcastle.

00:18.867 --> 00:21.267
With our friends.
And family.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.833
How are you?

00:22.900 --> 00:25.033
Yoo-hoo!
Nana!

00:25.100 --> 00:27.167
Doing the things we love.

00:30.167 --> 00:33.100
There'll be some new faces.
Hello!

00:33.167 --> 00:35.167
Plenty of old faces.

00:35.233 --> 00:37.233
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

00:37.300 --> 00:40.033
And one big blast from the past.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.767
Long time, no fucking see!

00:44.267 --> 00:45.933
But don't worry...

00:46.000 --> 00:47.800
We're still proper radge.

00:48.933 --> 00:51.967
Which means getting inebriated.

00:52.033 --> 00:53.333
You mean mortal?

00:54.867 --> 00:56.800
(retches)
Lots of fornication.

00:58.067 --> 00:59.367
Shagging, you divvy!

01:00.867 --> 01:02.267
Hello!

01:02.333 --> 01:03.900
And lots and lots of mayhem.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.767
(screaming)

01:09.033 --> 01:10.900
Fuck off! NOW!

01:17.700 --> 01:19.267
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:20.533 --> 01:22.567
It's gonna be a pure fucking
belter.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.233
(shouting)

01:25.300 --> 01:28.600
The party has arrived!

01:28.667 --> 01:31.667
I'm glad to be back with these
lot.
Hello!

01:31.733 --> 01:34.000
We've got a new girl.
I'm Faith.

01:34.067 --> 01:36.433
She's a cute bundle of absolute
joy.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.800
Drinks, whoo!
It looks like tomato soup.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.333
Barking up the wrong tree.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.400
Long time, no fucking see!

01:46.467 --> 01:49.100
Newcastle's biggest arsehole
is back in the mix

01:49.167 --> 01:51.667
and he's landed a promotion.
(screaming)

01:51.733 --> 01:54.133
Call them Donald Trump
and Theresa May.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.867
Me and Chloe
have bought our first home.

01:56.933 --> 02:01.167
I want all my family members
around my house. (cheering)

02:01.233 --> 02:03.867
I like to talk to Jesus.
Really?

02:03.933 --> 02:07.433
I have never had a religious
friend.
I cannot wait to know more.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.633
I'm pretty horny,
so I'm gonna use the dildo.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.467
(excited chattering)

02:12.533 --> 02:13.667
Where's Faith?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.800
Goodnight, God bless.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.567
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:19.633 --> 02:21.533
I'm preened to perfection.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.400
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:24.467 --> 02:27.400
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:27.467 --> 02:30.200
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:30.267 --> 02:33.233
I'm happy-go-lucky,
Jack the Lad, that's me to a T.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.033
I'm fit, I'm flirty,
I've got double Fs.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.633
What you see is what you get,
bags of fun.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.800
I cannot believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.767
Oh, my God, fucking hell, man.
How drunk was Nathan last night?

03:01.833 --> 03:05.000
I've woke up in the boys' room
and all I can smell is arse

03:05.067 --> 03:07.600
That's because Nathan
had everything up it.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.700
Right, hang on.

03:09.767 --> 03:12.833
You, right, you. You.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.200
What?
Ew. Right.

03:15.267 --> 03:18.033
I'd like to say it
was one of my best nights of my
life.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.367
Unfortunately,
I can't fucking remember.

03:20.433 --> 03:23.500
Nathan, the whole of the room
seen your bumhole

03:23.567 --> 03:25.400
and Faith was in disgrace.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.400
For all of us, it's so normal.

03:27.467 --> 03:30.733
I'm guessing she wasn't
expecting
to see that sort of thing.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.133
Do you know what? I don't care.
(laughter)

03:35.900 --> 03:39.167
How are you feeling?
Oh, fuck me.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.767
Fucking hell, I'd hate to be you
this morning, Abbie.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.933
Fucking hell. Girl was drunk.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.500
To be fair, it was a standard
night.
The girls were mortal

03:48.567 --> 03:51.033
and shoving sex toys up Nathan's
bum.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.800
You were a bit mortified of what
we were doing last night.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.600
Yeah. I think I was.

03:56.667 --> 04:00.100
We asked you to join in but
you wouldn't. No, definitely
not.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.333
Last night was wild
and to be honest,

04:02.400 --> 04:04.067
I was out of my comfort zone.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.633
I just couldn't bring myself
to join in.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.467
It'll take time.
Yeah.

04:08.533 --> 04:12.300
A few days' time, you'll be
shoving
anything up Nathan's arse.

04:12.367 --> 04:14.000
(farts) I can't stop farting.

04:14.067 --> 04:16.200
It's from the food.
Morning, worldies.

04:16.267 --> 04:17.666
Hello.
Morning.

04:17.733 --> 04:20.933
Well, Chloe staying in
the girls' room didn't last
long.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.200
Are us girls just a one-night
stand?

04:23.267 --> 04:25.233
I've just farted.
Have you?

04:25.300 --> 04:29.400
It stinks of shit.
I got a very good invite last
night.

04:29.467 --> 04:33.800
My house-warming? It's gonna be
very
posh cos I'm sophisticated now.

04:33.867 --> 04:37.133
I am so excited for everyone
to come to mine and Sam's house

04:37.200 --> 04:40.033
cos it is my special place
and I wanna share it.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.800
Is everyone excited? Yeah.
I'm really excited.

04:42.867 --> 04:45.767
I've never been yet.
No-one's been apart from Nathan.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.300
I'm so excited to see it.

04:47.367 --> 04:51.033
I'm just nervous because I don't
know
what it's gonna look like.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.400
A pigsty?

04:52.467 --> 04:54.733
Oh, there, listen. (farts)

04:58.900 --> 05:00.633
Oh. My. God.

05:01.867 --> 05:04.200
It stinks as well.
This is disgusting.

05:04.267 --> 05:07.000
Fucking hell.
Look at the state of this place.

05:07.067 --> 05:10.533
With me being a domesticated
goddess, however will I cope?

05:10.600 --> 05:14.400
Fucking hell, what's going on
down
here? It's like a bomb's gone
off.

05:14.467 --> 05:16.167
Nathan, this is all you.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.267
You lot started it and I
finished it.
Fuck off.

05:19.333 --> 05:23.367
Now we've moved in together,
we're
both posher. You're
domesticated?

05:23.433 --> 05:26.033
We gonna be Suarez.
Suarez! (laughs)

05:26.100 --> 05:27.233
Soiree!
Soiree.

05:27.300 --> 05:31.167
We're gonna have canapes,
caviar, champagne on arrival.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.133
Cheese, onion on a stick.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.867
If you wanna be posh,
just eat off a fucking stick.

05:36.933 --> 05:39.233
I've got an idea.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.500
We're gonna go to the gym!
Gym, gym, gym!

05:42.567 --> 05:45.633
The last thing I wanna do
is go to the gym.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.800
Never been to a gym in me life.
I'll look after you.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.833
It's a good friend of mine's.

05:50.900 --> 05:54.767
I'm getting everyone over to see
my
friend James. He's recently
single,

05:54.833 --> 05:57.500
and he needs the family
to cheer him up.

05:57.567 --> 06:00.967
Let's go get ready.
Dad bods are coming in, Nathan.

06:10.633 --> 06:13.900
I'll see you at mine.
Remember to come very formally.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.333
Thank fuck me and Chloe
can't go to the gym.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.400
We need to get back to ours
and tidy up.

06:21.433 --> 06:23.533
Gym, when I'm this rough?

06:23.600 --> 06:27.033
Fuck it. Means we can sweat out
this hangover and get our pump
on.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.067
I hope there's some fitties
in this gym.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.333
There always is. That's why I
go.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.167
Hello. Hello.

06:42.233 --> 06:43.833
Hello, you.
You all right?

06:43.900 --> 06:47.500
This gym is massive. James has
smashed it since leaving the
house.

06:47.567 --> 06:51.833
It's great to see him looking so
good
and doing so well.

06:51.900 --> 06:55.467
Everyone, this is James.
Hi, you all right? Abbie.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.800
Nice to meet you. You all right?

06:57.867 --> 07:01.500
How you doing? Nice to meet you.
You're looking well.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.567
It's nice to see James.

07:03.633 --> 07:07.933
Even though I love this family,
James is my original family.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.767
I've heard you're single.
Yeah. It's mad, innit?

07:10.833 --> 07:15.300
Just turned into a friendship,
if
anything. It was, like, six
years...

07:15.367 --> 07:18.333
It starts mint,
but then I see everyone else,

07:18.400 --> 07:20.767
they're getting engaged and
married.
Same.

07:20.833 --> 07:24.333
I don't want that.
It's great to be back with
Sophie.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.467
Me and her started this
right at the very beginning.

07:27.533 --> 07:30.300
Howay, let's go and train, yeah?
Howay, then.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.300
(Sophie) Bum out, tits out.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.867
My abs are fucking killing.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.333
Fuck this, I'm too hungover.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.400
I do not wanna be doing this.

07:49.233 --> 07:51.700
Sorry, James.
I can't be arsed.

07:51.767 --> 07:54.933
I think I'm better at pulling
lads
than pulling muscles.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.300
Have fun, guys. Bye. Howays.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.267
Last one standing.
I know.

08:01.333 --> 08:04.567
I haven't seen Sophie in ages.
She's looking really well.

08:04.633 --> 08:08.500
I've changed now. A changed
woman.
You're smashing it, aren't you?

08:08.567 --> 08:10.900
You're looking well.
Lost loads of weight.

08:10.967 --> 08:13.500
I had to.
It's that single life, man.

08:13.567 --> 08:15.733
It's so good to catch up with
James.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.567
He's like a brother.
And he is so much fun on a night
out.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.600
Why don't you come out tonight?
Where you going?

08:22.667 --> 08:24.100
Bijoux.
Bijoux?

08:24.167 --> 08:25.833
(laughter)

08:25.900 --> 08:29.000
I haven't been there for years.
You gotta come out with us.

08:29.067 --> 08:31.000
Aye.
Are you gonna do it?

08:31.067 --> 08:33.933
I love seeing the family
and meeting new faces.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.299
Faith, Abbie and Adam
seem like good crack. I can't
wait.

08:43.433 --> 08:47.033
Wha-hey, back home.
Take your fucking shoes off now.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.767
I'm not kidding you,
Chloe hoovers seven times a day.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.067
Right, time to hoover the bench.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.967
Don't get me wrong,
I pull my weight a little bit

08:56.033 --> 08:59.233
but I don't do much. She does
everything. It's brilliant.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.400
Hoover you now.
Ow.

09:02.467 --> 09:06.400
Are you joking? Shit.
I don't know how that happened.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.667
I've got some Dettol wipes.

09:08.733 --> 09:12.800
You know what I've realised.
I don't think we've got any food
in.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.633
We do, don't we?

09:14.700 --> 09:18.000
All we've got is fucking wine
and milk. It's out of date.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.200
It's embarrassing.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.733
If me and Sam are gonna have
a good dinner party,

09:21.800 --> 09:23.633
we need posh food pronto.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.067
Good job my mam lives
round the corner.

09:26.133 --> 09:30.333
She can pay for it and all.
Fucking save some money, eh?

09:36.067 --> 09:40.167
I've had fun at the gym. I can't
wait
for Sam and Chloe's
housewarming.

09:40.233 --> 09:43.767
I'm buzzing. So am I.
I wonder what the house is like.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.400
I still can't get over
that they've got a house.

09:46.467 --> 09:49.300
How the fuck do they pay bills
or even have a mortgage?

09:49.367 --> 09:51.000
Buying a house is a big thing.

09:51.067 --> 09:53.867
And it wasn't long ago Sam and
Chloe
were in Australia

09:53.933 --> 09:55.933
and breaking up every five
minutes.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.500
What food do you think they'll
have?
They'll have fuck all. Just
crisps.

10:06.300 --> 10:10.100
Look, "Welcum". I spelled "come"
"C-U-M" because it's funnier.

10:10.167 --> 10:13.133
It's meant to be C-O-M-E.
(doorbell rings)

10:13.200 --> 10:15.500
Oh, doorbell. We've got guests.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.700
That must be my mam with posh
food.

10:18.767 --> 10:22.667
I can't wait to make everything
perfect and for everyone to
arrive.

10:22.733 --> 10:25.733
Hello.
What the fuck is that? Barbara.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.800
(both laugh)
Oh, my God...

10:27.867 --> 10:29.033
Right, I know.

10:29.100 --> 10:32.533
Chloe's all grown up,
but she'll always need her mam.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.467
Fucking get in, Victoria sponge.
Belter.

10:35.533 --> 10:39.333
I'd put the things with your
sticks
on that to make it look nice.

10:39.400 --> 10:43.100
You do that.
I'll do that cos I'm the expert.

10:43.167 --> 10:46.533
Thank fuck for Chloe's mam.
She always comes to the rescue.

10:48.033 --> 10:51.867
Fucking hell, you know you're
posh
when you've got quiche. I know.

10:51.933 --> 10:54.400
I'll start with sausages.
Guess what? What?

10:54.467 --> 10:56.300
We've got a new girl.
Have they?

10:56.367 --> 11:00.267
Her name's Faith. She's
religious,
which is not a problem,

11:00.333 --> 11:03.867
but I wanna know more cos I
think
I might be religious. Uh-huh.

11:03.933 --> 11:06.767
When I was younger,
was I "bapmatised"? Yeah.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.867
Not bapti... You were
christened.
Was I? Yeah.

11:09.933 --> 11:11.967
You could've mentioned this
before.

11:12.033 --> 11:14.733
Maybe I have got more
in common with Faith.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.133
I've been bapmatised,
I believe in God.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.800
I need to have a talk with Faith

11:19.867 --> 11:23.467
and ask her about what her
beliefs are. Maybe I'm
"beliefic".

11:23.533 --> 11:25.200
Well, maybe you are.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.467
Chloe's telling me
there's a new girl.

11:27.533 --> 11:30.367
Chloe's gotta remember
she's got a boyfriend now

11:30.433 --> 11:33.233
cos I know sometimes
she can act a bit lesbiany.

11:33.300 --> 11:36.600
Do you like party sausages?
Yeah. Have one.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.767
Is that Monster Munch?
Yeah.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.200
Who says you need colour
in your diet?

11:41.267 --> 11:43.400
We've got a good old-fashioned
menu.

11:43.467 --> 11:48.400
Cocktails on a stick, crisps,
cheese
on a stick if you're posh like
me.

11:48.467 --> 11:52.267
Thank you, Mam, but it's time
for you to piss off. OK.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.433
My mam is amazing
and she has saved the day.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.900
But, Mam, this is a posh dinner
party. It's time you fucked off.

11:59.967 --> 12:01.967
Bye.
Bye.

12:02.033 --> 12:03.800
Doorbell.
I'll get it.

12:03.867 --> 12:07.800
This dinner party looks like a
Come
Dine With Me for four-year-olds.

12:07.867 --> 12:10.667
It's so good to catch up with
James.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.767
(screaming)

12:16.833 --> 12:18.833
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

12:21.000 --> 12:21.200
.

12:23.700 --> 12:23.900
.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.300
I'm really nervous.
I had the shakes before. Why?

12:37.367 --> 12:39.800
I've never had people
to my house before.

12:39.867 --> 12:42.500
I can't wait for them to see it.
Same.

12:42.567 --> 12:46.767
Me and Chloe have gone to long
lengths. I hope they appreciate
it.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.967
(knock on door)
Doorbell!

12:49.033 --> 12:52.100
I'll get it! Go on then.
I'm gonna scare them.

12:52.167 --> 12:56.333
Stop ringing it like that!
You'll
waste electricity! (knocking)

12:56.400 --> 12:59.000
(cheering)
Come in.

12:59.067 --> 13:02.433
Hello. You look lovely.
Hello!

13:02.500 --> 13:05.233
Welcome to my house.
What about my shoes?

13:05.300 --> 13:08.367
You look lovely, darling.
Take off your shoes!

13:08.433 --> 13:10.500
I'm actually gobsmacked.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.833
This looks really nice.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.233
You've put effort into it.
I'm glad you appreciate it.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.467
The table's amazing, I'm very
proud.

13:18.533 --> 13:21.667
He's got Disaronno.
Yes, of course. Drinks, wine,
vodka.

13:21.733 --> 13:25.100
Sam's house is unreal.
It's like a proper grown-up's
house.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.133
I'll be on my best behaviour.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.967
Take a seat. I'll take your
drink
order, as I'm a domestic
goddess.

13:31.033 --> 13:34.433
I'm impressed with Chloe and
Sam.
They've put in a lot of effort.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.867
But this looks like a
Come Dine With Me for
four-year-olds.

13:37.933 --> 13:42.367
Thank you to everybody for
coming
down to our housewarming party.

13:42.433 --> 13:46.600
I couldn't have wished to spend
it
with better people. To a good
night.

13:46.667 --> 13:49.033
(cheering)
I'm necking mine.

13:49.100 --> 13:52.900
I just wanna quickly wish you
lots
of blessings and great years.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.600
Thank you. Thank you, Faith.
Cheers to that.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.800
Everyone is in such high
spirits.

13:57.867 --> 14:00.700
Sitting with your number ones
is the best.

14:00.767 --> 14:02.367
What were you doing today?

14:02.433 --> 14:06.000
We had the best day.
The best day at the gym?

14:06.067 --> 14:08.667
It was gym with a twist.
Why? Why?

14:08.733 --> 14:11.567
Someone was there.
Who? Guess another.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.700
Who?
What guest, guest, guest?

14:13.767 --> 14:16.900
Sam, you'll love him.
Someone who's coming out
tonight.

14:16.967 --> 14:18.233
Fucking tell wuh then!

14:18.300 --> 14:20.800
James.
(cheering)

14:20.867 --> 14:25.667
I'm surprised James is leaving
the
gym. He loves doing bicep curls.

14:25.733 --> 14:28.467
Who's James?
(laughter)

14:28.533 --> 14:30.600
I'm just excited.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.967
Right, Faith, basically
I need to tell you something.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.733
You know you told us
you were religious? Yes.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.000
I don't like the word religious

14:44.067 --> 14:47.467
cos I think religious is sitting
in cathedrals, very quiet.

14:47.533 --> 14:51.667
Every night I say a little
prayer.
He's like a best friend really.

14:51.733 --> 14:54.333
Discussing religion
with Chloe is going great.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.267
She seems genuinely interested.

14:56.333 --> 15:00.433
Everyone who believes in God
goes to heaven. It's that
simple.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.200
I had no idea
that Faith is religious.

15:16.267 --> 15:18.700
It's nice to have
a different element.

15:18.767 --> 15:22.800
Right, let's cheers... Cheers
to...
What we cheersing to?

15:22.867 --> 15:24.067
Heaven.
Heaven.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.800
Heaven?
I thought we were going to
Bijoux.

15:29.100 --> 15:32.500
Right, is this a domestic
goddess?
Soph...

15:32.567 --> 15:35.167
I'm gonna help you.
I'm really good at cleaning.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.900
I'm having the best time
but it's getting messy.

15:37.967 --> 15:41.300
Get a bin bag.
I don't think we've got one.

15:41.367 --> 15:44.367
I didn't know what to expect
coming here tonight,

15:44.433 --> 15:48.233
but Chloe has done a really good
job,
and I'm proud of her.

15:48.300 --> 15:52.367
Would never think, like, me...
You know, I have no GCSEs,

15:52.433 --> 15:56.800
but I've achieved lots in this
house. This is my home, I love
it.

15:56.867 --> 15:59.700
It makes us feel so good
that people have come round

15:59.767 --> 16:02.000
and have seen how far I've came.

16:02.067 --> 16:05.833
Last one. Goodbye.
Goodbye, cakes. Goodbye, being
fat.

16:05.900 --> 16:09.200
Whey! Right, we're going.
I need to get changed quickly.

16:09.267 --> 16:13.033
The house party was lovely,
so let's hit the Toon to
celebrate.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.600
Come on, Chloe! Come on, Chloe!
Chloe, come on.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.967
Sorry, guys.
Chloe, look at this.

16:18.033 --> 16:19.800
I was changing my outfit.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.633
Pass the keys, Chloe.
I don't have the keys.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.567
You do.
Oh, there you go.

16:36.100 --> 16:40.467
We get into Bijoux and it is
going
off. The perfect place to come

16:40.533 --> 16:42.200
after a posh dinner party.

16:53.900 --> 16:58.000
Who would've thought a year ago
I'd
bought a house with my
boyfriend?

16:58.067 --> 16:59.700
It's fucking crazy.

17:04.333 --> 17:08.900
This soiree and showing our home
has made me feel closer to Chloe

17:08.967 --> 17:11.833
than I have before.
It doesn't get better than this.

17:24.532 --> 17:28.400
James is here.
Let's make it a night to
remember.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.067
The Geordie family nights
are the best.

17:34.133 --> 17:36.967
Even though I haven't been out
with this lot in ages,

17:37.033 --> 17:38.900
it feels like I've never been
away.

17:50.633 --> 17:54.900
Last time I had a night out with
James, we were both in
relationships.

17:54.967 --> 17:59.533
Now we're standing here, both
single,
having a shot. What the fuck?

18:21.500 --> 18:24.600
The dinner party was great
and it's good to see James.

18:24.667 --> 18:27.467
Everyone's getting along. I love
it.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.767
If only everyone was this
accepting.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.867
The thing I love about this
family

18:53.933 --> 18:56.600
is we all have
our different way of living

18:56.667 --> 18:58.900
but in this house
we can be ourselves,

18:58.967 --> 19:00.600
and we're loved for who we are.

19:09.100 --> 19:13.867
This is how I love it with me
and
Adam. Good friends getting
drunk.

19:29.133 --> 19:31.167
Looking at the state of
everyone,

19:31.233 --> 19:35.100
I think we've overdone it with
pre-drinks at the dinner party.

19:35.167 --> 19:37.167
Let's get back cos I am
starving.

19:37.233 --> 19:39.600
Yous! There's your kebab shop!

19:40.667 --> 19:43.467
You better have a veggie option.

19:43.533 --> 19:47.567
We're all fucked and we need
something to soak up the booze.

19:47.633 --> 19:50.767
At this time of night,
it means one thing, kebab.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.933
Ugh. I'm not eating kebab.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.533
Yous, everyone,
welcome James to the house.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.367
(cheering)

20:09.433 --> 20:13.667
Wow, the house is so different,
but the Geordie vibe's going
strong.

20:13.733 --> 20:17.900
Get your fucking cock out.
Get your fucking cock out.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.867
Get your fucking cock out.

20:19.933 --> 20:22.700
This lot are on a rampage.
Anything could happen.

20:22.767 --> 20:25.900
But I'm mortal
and I'm taking myself to bed.

20:32.700 --> 20:36.967
Tonight has been mint and I'm
not
ready for it to end. Hot tub
party?

20:38.867 --> 20:41.767
There we go,
there we go, there we go.

20:41.833 --> 20:44.233
Everybody, one, two...

20:44.300 --> 20:47.400
That's two, mate.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.167
Three!

20:49.233 --> 20:51.133
(laughter)

20:52.633 --> 20:56.967
For me, James, absolutely top
lad.
This is fucking hilarious.

20:57.033 --> 20:58.067
Argh!

21:02.100 --> 21:06.100
When I'm drunk I shouldn't
be left alone. Don't blame me.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.233
Here she is, the love of my
life,
covered in mud,

21:13.300 --> 21:16.867
and that is why I love her.
I might get lucky in the shower.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.333
Ow.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.833
Whoops! Maybe the shag pad
is a safer option.

21:26.233 --> 21:31.533
Is this bed dirty before I lie
on it? Are they poo stains?

21:33.500 --> 21:36.033
I have got no idea where
everyone
else is.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.533
But that doesn't matter.
I can make my own fun.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.367
(sings)

21:43.767 --> 21:46.000
(screams)

21:47.900 --> 21:50.333
Ay-yaaaaaah!

21:50.400 --> 21:53.533
The gnome! I can't see!

21:55.133 --> 21:58.300
I really think that Faith needs
to break it off with the gnome

21:58.367 --> 22:00.667
and get herself a real cock.

22:00.733 --> 22:03.200
Are yous gonna have sex?

22:03.267 --> 22:06.600
That's the plan, Faith.
But only if you pipe down.

22:06.667 --> 22:10.233
Do you want me to sing
whilst you are having sex?

22:10.300 --> 22:13.367
Finally me and Sam
are getting intimate.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.133
I've been waiting
for this all night.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.367
Hello!

22:17.433 --> 22:19.333
What is Faith doing?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.733
Have you finally had sex?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.000
I don't understand
what's going on here.

22:24.067 --> 22:26.467
Faith, seriously, get lost.

22:32.367 --> 22:34.233
Tonight has been unreal.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.233
We've all managed to get
smashed,
I've eaten kebab,

22:37.300 --> 22:39.400
the house is trashed.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.833
Now all that's left to do
is go to bed.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.900
Shall we go upstairs?
Yeah.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.800
Oi, oi, party crew.
Oh, fuck!

22:56.867 --> 23:01.033
This Geordie squad is about to
get
a belter of an education.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.667
(laughs)

23:02.733 --> 23:07.433
I'm gonna wingman the fuck out
of Adam. I'm gonna help Abbie
then.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.100
(cheering)

23:09.167 --> 23:11.500
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:14.467 --> 23:14.667
.

23:17.167 --> 23:17.367
.

23:26.967 --> 23:29.633
Morning, everyone.
Morning, girls. Morning.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.533
Morning, girls.
What are you doing in here?

23:32.600 --> 23:35.000
Sophie, your fucking nipple's
out.
So fuck.

23:35.067 --> 23:38.067
Got a visitor.
Not for long, I'm off.

23:38.133 --> 23:41.033
It's nice to see that Chloe
slept in the girls' room,

23:41.100 --> 23:44.100
but she's brought her boyfriend.
That wasn't the deal.

23:44.167 --> 23:47.733
Did you shag? She did.
Did you shag in here?

23:47.800 --> 23:51.533
No, in the shag pad.
I was swimming around. No, I
didn't.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.467
You walked in, you divvy.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.200
I bet you were watching.
I couldn't see anything.

23:56.267 --> 24:00.233
Last night I was having a mint
time.
I just wanted to join in the
fun.

24:00.300 --> 24:03.933
Not to be a perv. I just thought
for scientific reasons.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.933
To see what it looked like.
Yeah, just to learn.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.933
She refused to watch Nathan
and his dildo,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.033
but last night she's watching me
and
Sam have sex. I'm really
confused.

24:14.100 --> 24:17.400
I celebrated my housewarming
party
too much last night.

24:17.467 --> 24:19.900
Good housewarming party though.
It was good.

24:19.967 --> 24:22.700
Wonder how James is.
Why don't you go and find out?

24:22.767 --> 24:26.167
I need a big fucking
morning shit as well.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.933
Morning, you sexy bunch of
bastards!

24:35.000 --> 24:39.367
It's so weird to see James
in that bedroom but with new
people.

24:39.433 --> 24:42.967
Did you have a good night?
Aye. Everyone's spot on.

24:43.033 --> 24:46.033
It's weird. Have the last four
years
been a dream?

24:46.100 --> 24:48.500
You know what's gonna happen
today?

24:48.567 --> 24:52.333
Fucking Scott's gonna come
and be like, "You're going to
work."

24:52.400 --> 24:55.367
No, do it yourself.
(laughs)

25:01.300 --> 25:04.467
Babe, I think you need a bigger
pan.
There's not one.

25:04.533 --> 25:08.133
You need another pan.
They're not going to cook
properly.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.700
Ooh, I'm sorry, expert.

25:09.767 --> 25:12.967
Who the fuck has put Faith
in charge of the sausages?

25:13.033 --> 25:15.033
She's a fucking vegetarian!

25:15.100 --> 25:17.333
Breakfast is ready!

25:17.400 --> 25:20.367
Whoo-hoo! What is that?
I've cooked it.

25:21.933 --> 25:25.033
This is a good breakfast, this.

25:25.100 --> 25:28.967
I'm getting a weird vibe off
Chloe.
Have I done something wrong?

25:35.200 --> 25:39.700
It was great to see James. I
love the
fact that once you join this
family,

25:39.767 --> 25:42.867
you never really leave.
See you later on, mate.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.933
The highest addiction
in the world is sugar.

25:52.667 --> 25:57.333
It's like you go into a candy
shop,
and your brain's like, "Ooh."

25:58.867 --> 26:02.100
You have that bit of cake
and eat it and you're like,
"Mmm."

26:02.167 --> 26:05.100
Oi, oi, party crew!
Oh, fuck.

26:05.167 --> 26:07.567
Turbo T is back.
Hi. Hello.

26:07.633 --> 26:08.900
Howay.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.233
If this day couldn't get worse,
Scott's fucking turned up.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.767
Why can you never just walk in
the house like a normal person?

26:15.833 --> 26:19.967
Yous all know why I'm here.
Boss man. There's work today.

26:20.033 --> 26:23.600
I've got Geor-Day Tours.
I've been Anna's number one
worker,

26:23.667 --> 26:26.400
so I know what it takes
to get the job fucking done.

26:26.467 --> 26:29.500
This Geordie squad is gonna get
a belter of an education.

26:29.567 --> 26:33.400
Nathan, Abbie and Faith, we're
going
to a fucking bouncy castle.

26:33.467 --> 26:36.533
For fuck's sake, I'd love that.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.033
For fuck's sake, this is not
what
I need on a hangover.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.933
It's cush. Howay, get ready.
Go on, get up.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.867
(all laugh)

26:44.933 --> 26:49.967
I'm gutted the others have got
the
day off. I knew Scott hated me.

26:50.033 --> 26:52.433
See yous there.
Let's go get ready.

26:58.767 --> 27:02.033
I've got no idea
what Geor-Day Tours is,

27:02.100 --> 27:04.667
but I'm looking forward
to more bonding time.

27:06.733 --> 27:08.700
What time do you call this,
like?

27:08.767 --> 27:10.867
Oh, don't you start already.

27:10.933 --> 27:15.167
So, listen, listen. Hey, today
we're gonna be testing out

27:15.233 --> 27:17.667
big, inflatable objects.

27:17.733 --> 27:19.933
Anna wants me to see
if this new activity

27:20.000 --> 27:22.333
would be good on Geor-Day Tours.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.633
I'm gonna stick these divvies
in here and put them to the
test.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.667
Are you hungover? Yes.
Great! Let's get cracking.

27:28.733 --> 27:30.967
I can't stand him already.

27:31.033 --> 27:32.933
How we doing, kid?

27:34.700 --> 27:38.700
I don't know what Scott's
thinking.
There is nothing bouncy about
this.

27:38.767 --> 27:42.033
It's like a military assault
course
in a bloody disco.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.667
Nathan,
your dick's going in my face.

27:44.733 --> 27:46.767
Oh...
Go on.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.667
Aah!

27:48.733 --> 27:51.600
Fucking hell, Abbie,
that was useless.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.500
Let me show you how it's done.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.867
How you finding it all?
I'm absolutely loving it.

28:02.933 --> 28:05.100
You become a lot closer
than friends.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.867
It's like brothers and sisters,
like a family.

28:07.933 --> 28:10.300
If you've got problems,
tell the people.

28:10.367 --> 28:13.067
Don't bottle them up
and let them all explode.

28:13.133 --> 28:16.200
Scott's really fit,
has given great advice

28:16.267 --> 28:19.933
and is an all-around nice lad.
What more could I ask from a
boss?

28:21.700 --> 28:25.533
I don't know about you, I'm sick
of
watching them two tateys on
there.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.633
We're gonna do our thing over
here.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.800
(pants, gasps)

28:29.867 --> 28:31.533
They're too hard.

28:31.600 --> 28:36.033
I'm knackered after hanging off
those
rings. It's time for a breather.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.467
Whoa!
I can't, I can't. I hate it.

28:39.533 --> 28:43.700
I only just hit 5'2". How the
fuck
am I supposed to do this?

28:43.767 --> 28:45.900
(screams)

28:48.300 --> 28:50.133
Anna is onto a winner here.

28:51.967 --> 28:54.700
I could bounce
round this place all day long.

28:55.767 --> 28:57.900
He is a full man-child.

28:57.967 --> 29:00.400
Step on the green things.
Get in.

29:00.467 --> 29:02.367
Howay, Abbie.
Come on, get in!

29:02.433 --> 29:03.800
Get me in that pit.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.667
There's nothing I love more
than a massive pole.

29:06.733 --> 29:09.300
Shall we have a blast?
No, no. (screams)

29:11.867 --> 29:13.067
Abbie, come on.

29:13.133 --> 29:15.433
I've got you, babes.
(screams, laughs)

29:15.500 --> 29:19.200
There was a time where I
would've
loved Scott to be bouncing on
us.

29:19.267 --> 29:23.633
Now he's a boss, so he shouldn't
be mixing business with
pleasure.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.300
How do you think we did?
You were terrible.

29:26.367 --> 29:28.233
I tried everything.
Howay then.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.967
Listen,
I'll be seeing you soon, kid.

29:31.033 --> 29:34.767
You never know
when I might just pop up. Scott!

29:34.833 --> 29:38.800
Work wasn't that bad. Maybe
Scott's
not gonna be a bad boss after
all.

29:39.933 --> 29:43.100
I don't think I've done so much
exercise in my whole life.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.333
I am knackered after today's
work.

29:55.400 --> 29:59.600
But all I wanna do now is get
ready,
get out and get mortal.

30:13.433 --> 30:17.267
Talk us through them jeans.
Bootcut went out of fashion in
1982.

30:17.333 --> 30:20.500
Don't come for me
unless I said it to you.

30:20.567 --> 30:24.367
Look at you moving cos you're
scared.
Why-aye. You're fucking scared!

30:24.433 --> 30:28.267
Fucking bootcut, you bastard!
I'll fucking bootcut you!

30:28.333 --> 30:32.067
The boys' bond hasn't been this
tight
for a very long time.

30:32.133 --> 30:33.733
Lads, lads, lads, lads.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.900
Talk me through
what's going on with yous
tonight.

30:36.967 --> 30:40.033
Back-up option, Abbie?
Is Abbie a back-up option?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.700
Or is she your front option?

30:41.767 --> 30:46.733
During the day with me and
Abbie,
it's just a flirt, friends and
that.

30:46.800 --> 30:50.367
When I've had a drink,
I wanna get to grab her.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.467
Adam and Abbie get on really
well,

30:52.533 --> 30:55.867
but unfortunately for Adam,
Abbie only sees him as a good
mate.

30:55.933 --> 30:58.300
You're not gonna get
with Abbie tonight.

30:58.367 --> 31:02.133
The only way we're gonna
find out if Abbie likes Adam

31:02.200 --> 31:06.500
is if he cracks on with
somebody.
If she gets jealous, she likes
him.

31:06.567 --> 31:10.200
I'm gonna wingman the fuck
out of Adam tonight. Yes, lad.

31:10.267 --> 31:13.767
I'm like a dog with two dicks,
but point aside...

31:13.833 --> 31:17.700
I might have another go at
grafting
Abbie, but she's not into us.

31:17.767 --> 31:20.367
If a girl likes me for me,
I need to find her.

31:20.433 --> 31:23.167
Oh! Hang on,
you pipe the fuck down there,
mate.

31:23.233 --> 31:27.033
I'm gonna help Abbie if this
is how cocky you wanna fucking
get.

31:27.100 --> 31:30.100
Is Sam's gonna take Adam on the
pull,

31:30.167 --> 31:34.600
I'm gonna wingman Abbie cos who
doesn't love friendly
competition?

31:34.667 --> 31:37.433
May the best man win. Shake my
hand.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.333
I'm gonna tell the girls.
Don't touch me.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.467
Come here.
(both laugh)

31:43.967 --> 31:46.133
(cheering)
Hi.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.433
What's the crack?
Not much.

31:48.500 --> 31:52.000
Well, Sam's gonna help Adam
go on the pull,

31:52.067 --> 31:56.567
so I think I might help you.
Yeah.
Wingman assemble.

31:56.633 --> 32:01.600
Some poor girl is gonna have to
put
up with Adam's shitty chat-up
lines.

32:01.667 --> 32:04.167
If there's a cute boy out there
for me, bonus.

32:04.233 --> 32:06.300
Faith, you're single as well.

32:06.367 --> 32:09.700
Get rid of that gnome
cos that would scare them away.

32:09.767 --> 32:13.567
I wouldn't want to bring anyone
back
that couldn't accept my gnome.

32:13.633 --> 32:16.500
That's a fucking cock-block
if there ever was one.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.867
(cheering)

32:21.667 --> 32:25.100
I am well up for tonight.
It's gonna be epic.

32:25.167 --> 32:29.800
Let's have a toast to some
friendly
motherfucking competition.

32:29.867 --> 32:33.000
(cheering)
Cheers to that, motherfucker.

32:33.067 --> 32:34.967
Howay, yous! Get in the taxi!

32:45.700 --> 32:48.133
I've got my work cut out
to win this.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.400
I dare you to deepthroat.

32:50.467 --> 32:53.100
I thought Chloe and I
were getting along well.

32:53.167 --> 32:54.733
I'm not gonna do it.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.200
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:59.933 --> 33:00.133
.

33:02.667 --> 33:02.867
.

33:13.467 --> 33:17.600
We've got to the club. I tell
you
something, I am on one tonight.

33:25.267 --> 33:29.300
I absolutely love Adam. I don't
know
why Abbie just doesn't get with
him.

33:29.367 --> 33:31.033
If I was a girl, I would.

33:59.233 --> 34:01.633
I thought Nathan
was doing this to help me,

34:01.700 --> 34:04.900
but he's having a willy-waving
competition with Sam.

34:15.367 --> 34:17.867
(chattering)

34:17.933 --> 34:21.100
I've told you before, I'll tell
you
again. I am a top wingman.

34:21.167 --> 34:22.467
Adam, thank me later.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.400
As Sam is on the pull with Adam,
I'll join Nathan's team.

34:37.766 --> 34:42.067
I'm not about pulling at all
tonight.
It's time to dance the night
away.

34:52.867 --> 34:55.867
Nathan, that is a good spot.
He's all right.

35:10.633 --> 35:14.667
With opening lines like that,
I've got my work cut out to win
this.

35:18.667 --> 35:22.267
I'm interested to see how
this wingman competition comes
out,

35:22.333 --> 35:26.400
but today I don't feel as close
to the girls as I have.

35:31.533 --> 35:35.567
Sam's found me this gorgeous
girl
and with Abbie being on the
pull,

35:35.633 --> 35:37.433
it'd be rude not to try it on.

35:50.133 --> 35:54.467
They don't call me Wingman Sam
for
no reason. My work here is done.

35:54.533 --> 35:58.100
It's time to refuel. And by
refuel,
I mean getting mortal.

36:03.267 --> 36:07.333
It looks like Adam has already
pulled. Time for me to up the
game.

36:10.533 --> 36:13.000
Well, it's pointless
beating around the bush.

36:15.233 --> 36:19.800
I do feel a bit mean, but I'm
just
not arsed about this
competition.

36:19.867 --> 36:22.667
In the past, me and Adam
would just be having fun.

36:26.067 --> 36:29.067
Well, there's no way
I'm getting this girl laid
tonight.

36:45.033 --> 36:48.133
Everyone's getting wasted, but
Faith
is sat on her own.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.567
I hope she's all right.

36:58.233 --> 37:02.833
I'm sat taking a minute, and
bless
Nathan, he always makes an
effort.

37:19.233 --> 37:23.633
Faith came in with a bang, but
it does takes a while to settle
in.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.367
I should know. It took me ages.

37:37.933 --> 37:41.200
I just hope Faith keeps making
an effort with the girls.

37:41.267 --> 37:44.767
It's not easy, but it's what
she needs to do to be accepted.

38:02.700 --> 38:06.900
I'm having a great night. I
pulled
a worldie and she's coming back.

38:12.700 --> 38:15.500
Get yourself in. Get yourself
in.

38:17.700 --> 38:18.933
Bed.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.733
I don't know what's going on,
but
something's definitely in the
air.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.100
Everyone is mortal.

38:24.167 --> 38:28.633
Do you want a cider?
No, babe, I think I'm all right.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.500
Bed, come on.
Ooh, this doesn't look right.

38:31.567 --> 38:35.133
Guess who is not
getting any sex tonight. Me.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.200
Water's near your bed.

38:38.667 --> 38:43.033
Adam's brought a girl back and
he hasn't introduced us. How
rude.

38:43.100 --> 38:46.600
What's her name? What?
What's her name? What you on
about?

38:46.667 --> 38:49.900
What's her name?
Oh, I can be a bitch.

38:49.967 --> 38:52.267
What is my name? Go on.

38:52.333 --> 38:55.333
Maybe this is why
I've never had a relationship.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.467
What's her name?
My gorgeous lass.

38:57.533 --> 38:59.733
(laughter)

38:59.800 --> 39:01.167
Thank fuck.

39:03.067 --> 39:05.233
Abbie, truth or dare?

39:05.300 --> 39:07.667
Dare.
I dare you to neck on with Adam.

39:07.733 --> 39:09.800
Is he serious?

39:09.867 --> 39:11.833
Things are getting proper
awkward.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.367
Fuck off.

39:13.433 --> 39:16.600
I know she doesn't fancy him,
but I love a bit of drama.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.467
I dare you...

39:19.533 --> 39:21.867
to deepthroat.
Yay!

39:21.933 --> 39:26.500
I wanna know if Faith is a prude
or like the rest of wuh.

39:26.567 --> 39:29.733
No-one asked me truth or dare.
She just did.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.867
She didn't ask truth or dare.

39:31.933 --> 39:36.933
You guys enjoy sucking a fake
cock,
that's fine, but it's not my
thing.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.500
But why not?

39:38.567 --> 39:41.667
I don't know,
it's just not in my nature.

39:41.733 --> 39:44.533
We're just playing a game.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.600
But it's just not my humour.

39:46.667 --> 39:50.567
It's a laugh. It's the way we go
on.
It's a laugh...

39:50.633 --> 39:54.467
When he was putting something
up his arse, you said no.

39:54.533 --> 39:56.200
You seen this, you say no.

39:56.267 --> 39:58.633
Chloe has been off with us all
day.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.567
I don't wanna gobble
on a rubber willy.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.867
I'm not having a go,
but everything's no.

40:03.933 --> 40:05.900
It's the way we are.

40:05.967 --> 40:10.733
I feel on edge. We're sucking
cocks.
I feel I'm doing something
wrong.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.767
I don't mind people being
different,

40:12.833 --> 40:15.333
but with Faith,
I feel like she judges us.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.067
I'm not getting angry...

40:17.133 --> 40:20.067
I do think you need
to take your tone down a little
bit.

40:20.133 --> 40:23.567
I know you're just trying
to get your point across...

40:23.633 --> 40:25.100
But you're not listening.

40:25.167 --> 40:27.033
I am listening to you.

40:27.100 --> 40:31.933
Faith has been a bit separate,
but I
didn't think her and Chloe had
beef.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.567
When I stick a cock in front of
you,
I wanna know why you won't suck
it.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.467
Maybe she might feel
a bit uncomfortable...

40:38.533 --> 40:40.567
That's not me as a person.

40:40.633 --> 40:42.600
I have no idea what's went
wrong.

40:42.667 --> 40:44.967
I need to take myself out
of this situation.

40:45.033 --> 40:48.633
Sophie, I'm not fine.
Fuck yous all. Whatever.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.233
Fuck's sake.

40:55.467 --> 40:58.033
I just want her to be honest.

40:58.100 --> 41:01.067
I thought Chloe and I
were getting along really well.

41:01.133 --> 41:03.433
I just want her to accept me for
me.

41:03.500 --> 41:06.567
The reason we're in there
is because we're who we wanna
be.

41:06.633 --> 41:07.733
Yeah.

41:07.800 --> 41:11.533
I feel like I have been myself,
but tonight I'm getting judged

41:11.600 --> 41:15.933
because me, I'm not gonna
fucking
suck a dildo. That's not me.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.667
So I'm not gonna do it.
You know who you remind us of?

41:19.733 --> 41:20.800
Holly.

41:20.867 --> 41:24.200
Holly came into this house,
right,
day one,

41:24.267 --> 41:26.433
she was very different from the
rest.

41:26.500 --> 41:30.500
She stood out like a sore thumb,
and there were times where we
were,

41:30.567 --> 41:34.667
"She's a weirdo." "We don't want
to be involved." Look at her
now.

41:34.733 --> 41:35.933
She's my sister.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.933
Being different can be a good
thing.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.300
Holly came into this house
very different.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.633
Look at her now.
She's part of the family.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.500
You got it?
Definitely. Got it.

41:44.567 --> 41:45.567
Got it?

41:45.633 --> 41:49.233
And then that... Go on, give us
a hug. You're good, yeah?

41:49.300 --> 41:52.100
Sophie's got my back.
She's given us the confidence

41:52.167 --> 41:54.733
that I should just be myself.
That is all I know.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.933
We both know what it's like
coming in.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.600
I fucking told the bastards I
was bi.
Was I fuck? I was sucking cock.

42:00.667 --> 42:03.267
Chloe is annoyed.
I get where she's coming from.

42:03.333 --> 42:07.067
But maybe we need to think
of other ways to get Faith
involved.

42:07.133 --> 42:08.933
I just wanna get to know her.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.533
It'll happen. It doesn't happen
overnight, does it? It takes
time.

42:13.600 --> 42:17.200
I think everyone forgets how
hard it
is when you first come in here.

42:17.267 --> 42:20.300
When I first came in,
I didn't have a clue how to act.

42:20.367 --> 42:24.033
So I think we need to give Faith
a bit of time to find her feet.

42:38.867 --> 42:42.500
I didn't wanna make Faith upset.
I wanted to get my point across.

42:42.567 --> 42:45.700
She picks and chooses
when to be part of this family.

42:45.767 --> 42:48.733
And right now, I don't know
what Faith is the real Faith.

42:56.667 --> 42:59.433
I think we should go
on a girls' trip!

42:59.500 --> 43:00.867
(all cheer)

43:00.933 --> 43:03.600
I'm determined to make this trip
one to remember.

43:03.667 --> 43:04.933
(all) To the girls!

43:06.033 --> 43:07.633
Three lads...
One cup.

43:07.700 --> 43:09.167
Now!

43:09.233 --> 43:11.167
Adam, get off me! I can't swim!

43:12.267 --> 43:16.500
Usually when you say sorry, they
normally accept it, but not
Faith.

43:20.133 --> 43:24.300
I've had an accident.
Oh, my God, no. It's all over my
leg.

43:24.367 --> 43:26.233
(vomits)

43:26.300 --> 43:28.433
FUCK OFF! NOW!

43:55.900 --> 43:56.133
.
