It's good money

When they call you in right away,

Enhanced interrogation?

they ask you a bunch of questions.

They're gonna document the case
so they don't have to pay.

I saw you in the ads.
You said there was a larger pattern.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.954
Well, I knew your name because
they said it on the intercom at reception.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.168
And the ads, I sold my face

05:35.251 --> 05:37.920

so it's...

05:41.883 --> 05:42.717

13:48.702 --> 13:51.455
[Muramoto] Could you tell Miss Nine
to come in, Mr. One?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.209
He wants you to go in there.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.426
[Muramoto] <i>I don't know how</i>
<i>you had access to the pill,</i>

14:04.760 --> 14:10.808
but analysis of the biodata indicates
that you have been using it compulsively.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.274
I haven't.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.782
I sympathize with you.

14:27.157 --> 14:31.787
The "A" experience, on its own,
can be a seductive demon.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.873
What are you talking about?

14:33.956 --> 14:36.333
[Muramoto] Most people wouldn't understand

14:36.417 --> 14:41.505
why someone wants to revisit a trauma
again and again,

14:41.589 --> 14:43.549
even take pleasure from it.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.553
Most people, wouldn't.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.513
But you do.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.517
[inhales deeply]

14:53.601 --> 14:57.021
People like that
don't want to move forward.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.607
I don't deserve to.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.484
[Muramoto] Don't you?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.778
I want to move forward.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.658
I want to know what the second pill does.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.621
People who feel they deserve loss...

15:14.955 --> 15:16.874
might try to move forward.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.919
They might taste recovery...

15:21.462 --> 15:25.007
but they always end up going back.

15:28.886 --> 15:29.720
Why?

15:29.803 --> 15:31.555
[inhales deeply] Be--

15:33.182 --> 15:36.268
[Moromoto breathes raggedly]

15:42.316 --> 15:43.442
Dr. Muramoto?

15:45.611 --> 15:46.487
Is--

15:47.404 --> 15:48.322
Is this...

15:49.031 --> 15:49.865
part of...?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.493
Is this a test?

15:55.287 --> 15:56.622
[telephone rings]

15:57.373 --> 15:58.624
Or is that the test?

16:00.417 --> 16:02.127
You wanna see if I'll answer it?

16:04.171 --> 16:05.631
[telephone continues ringing]

16:06.924 --> 16:07.967
I can wait.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.013
I'll wait forever.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.605
Are you actually dead?

16:25.025 --> 16:26.026
Fuck!

16:27.319 --> 16:28.862
[whispers] Owen, I need your help.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.865
-What?
-Just get the fuck in here!

16:38.747 --> 16:40.666
Do not let anyone come in this door.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.211
-Did you kill him?
-No, I didn't fuckin' kill him.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.337
He just died.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.506
Sometimes people just die.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.094
He made me take a pill.

16:53.721 --> 16:54.596
What'd you see?

16:55.806 --> 16:56.682
Olivia.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.894
-We were studying.
-Is that your girlfriend?

17:00.978 --> 17:01.812
[Owen] No.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.188
It's a girl I liked.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.983
She asked me to help her
with her, uh, history finals.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.318
I, like, wanted to talk to her
all semester.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.447
And I was on my way to the library,
and I saw him.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.615
Grimsson.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.701
That was the first time
he ever came to me.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.078
And he told me to watch out for Olivia,

17:18.579 --> 17:20.622
and I just realized she was a plant.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.626
My parents had paid her
to pretend to like me.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.254
They were listening in.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.007
My brothers were listening in.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.925
They were just laughing at me.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.013
My mind kept racing.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.266
Like, someone had given her
information on me.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.895
How she was getting paid

17:42.978 --> 17:45.522
for every minute she made me happy...

17:48.901 --> 17:52.071
and that my parents
paid her to marry me...

17:52.905 --> 17:54.364
and grow old with me...

17:54.948 --> 17:57.451
and have a family and seven kids.

17:58.619 --> 18:02.539
I started asking her
if her name was even... Olivia.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.168
And... she's like, "Are you okay?"

18:06.251 --> 18:08.796
I said, "No, I'm not okay.
None of this is real.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.801
None of this is real.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.970
None of this is real."

18:24.812 --> 18:26.522
Sounds like you were having a day.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.649
What?

18:31.568 --> 18:34.822
That's what my mom used to call it
when she got her wires crossed.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.199
[Owen] Doctors called it a BLIP.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.368
Brief and limited psychosis.

18:41.036 --> 18:41.995
I didn't know that.

18:43.038 --> 18:43.914
I...

18:45.290 --> 18:47.751
I just started screaming at her.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.422
I just yelled
some fucked up things at her.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.761
And other people started looking at me,

18:57.845 --> 19:00.430
and I started throwing books at them
and screaming at them.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.311
And I knew I was right.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.605
I was so sure I was right.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.946
Have you ever just felt unbelievably sure

19:16.446 --> 19:18.824
that you were right
and everyone else was wrong?

19:21.285 --> 19:22.744
[Annie] All the time.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.085
I'll do yours.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.672
Where did you end up?

19:35.507 --> 19:38.719
Strapped to a gurney
in a little room by myself...

19:40.929 --> 19:42.389
screaming for my mom.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.895
[exhales] That's rough.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.157
Let's go back out there and pretend
nothing fucked up happened.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.621
[Carl] The food cubes being distributed
during Meal Time

20:05.704 --> 20:09.124
deliver a specific amount
of nutrients and calories to the body.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.376
That means that your plates
at the end of Meal Time

20:11.460 --> 20:13.045
need to be happy plates.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.339
Does everyone know what a happy plate is?

20:15.422 --> 20:17.007
A happy plate is a clean plate.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.427
I can't eat.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.054
[Carl] You have to.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.515
It's not to make me happy,
but to make science happy.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.894
[woman] Tastes like the inside
of my cat's uterus.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.313
Stay out of your cat's uterus.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.440
[man] Is this food?

20:34.942 --> 20:37.152
Tell me why the pill
was so important to you

20:37.236 --> 20:39.863
that you lied to get in here
and you tricked me.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.368
I never would have messed with you
if I knew all that stuff had happened.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.161
The BLIP.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.623
It's okay. It's not your fault.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.337
[inhales deeply]

20:55.420 --> 20:58.173
My sister and I were in a car crash
five years ago.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.969
The driver passed out
behind the wheel of a semi-truck.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.054
He had been driving for 30 hours.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.681
He was high on NoDoze.

21:07.307 --> 21:12.854
His name was Greg F.U.N. Nazlund.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.440
His middle name was "fun."

21:18.235 --> 21:20.737
It was his fucking fault
if we're talking about fault.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.202
Every time I take that pill,

21:27.286 --> 21:29.246
I have to live through
the worst day of my life,

21:29.329 --> 21:30.372
just like you did.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.625
I have to hear myself say the worst...

21:34.710 --> 21:37.004
ugliest things I've ever said to anyone.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.383
And it ends with the worst thing
that ever happened.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.429
I fucking love it.

21:47.931 --> 21:48.765
Why?

21:51.101 --> 21:52.561
Because I get to be with her.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.692
Oh, they found him.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.031
[Carl] <i>I thought he was napping</i>
<i>when I first came in.</i>

22:05.115 --> 22:06.199
Poor Robert.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.372
It's a catastrophe.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.377
[Carl] Want me to bring in a team,
get him out of here?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.130
No. Leave him.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.427
I have to go up to the 77th floor.

22:32.851 --> 22:33.810
[door closes]

22:42.069 --> 22:42.986
[sniffles]

22:46.239 --> 22:48.200
[Yoda in Japanese]

22:48.283 --> 22:49.826
[Azumi in Japanese]

22:56.333 --> 22:58.502
[Yoda]

23:06.676 --> 23:07.969
[Yoda]

23:35.205 --> 23:36.331
[Yoda]

23:53.306 --> 23:54.474
[Yoda]

23:56.935 --> 23:58.812
[Azumi]

24:07.946 --> 24:09.656
It was a past life.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.325
An old life.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.037
Lies forced us apart...

24:17.372 --> 24:18.999
and now we can't remember.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.419
No... I remember.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.421
We were lovers.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.175
Now we're gonna be together forever.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.891
High Priestess of Atlantis...

24:37.017 --> 24:38.143
can you feel that?

24:38.935 --> 24:40.562
My energy in your chest?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.689
I can feel it.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.566
Good.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.277
-Now, put your hands on me.
-Okay.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.414
[moans]

25:00.665 --> 25:02.792
-That's excellent.
-[Priestess moans]

25:19.684 --> 25:22.395
-[man] See what she does with a ping-pong.
-[man 2] She shot them...

25:22.479 --> 25:24.606
[woman] It was cute, but I wasn't into it,
y'know?

25:24.689 --> 25:27.359
-[man] Why weren't you into it?
-[woman] It was weird.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.954
-[Mantleray] Fabulous.
-[moans]

25:40.288 --> 25:41.331
[Priestess moans]

25:41.414 --> 25:43.166
That's good. That's good.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.418
<i>-</i>[Priestess moans]
<i>-</i>That's good.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.128
Oh, that's... excellent.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.214
[Azumi] James.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.300
-[Priestess] <i>Oh, my God.</i>
-That's excellent.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.426
[Priestess moans]

25:53.510 --> 25:55.387
-Oh, that's excellent.
-[Azumi] James!

25:57.389 --> 25:59.641
[Priestess moans]

26:00.517 --> 26:01.726
[Sucktube powers off]

26:01.810 --> 26:03.270
[Azumi] I'm sorry to...

26:03.812 --> 26:05.564
to walk in on you like this, but...

26:06.189 --> 26:07.607
I still have my key.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.947
I thought we had agreed...

26:15.699 --> 26:18.076
that you wouldn't bother me
while I was working.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.663
I need your help.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.708
The very fact that you braved
the outside world for me

26:24.791 --> 26:26.293
tells me this is an emergency.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.005
Let me guess. You're having trouble
dampening the reality test

26:30.088 --> 26:31.339
when it drops to NREM 3.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.718
Now Dr. Muramoto has begged you
to come and beg me

26:34.801 --> 26:36.678
-to come help him.
-[Azumi] He's dead.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.099
He was freebasing an A/C mixture.

26:41.975 --> 26:42.809
Uh<i>-</i>huh.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.064
And who's going to replace him?

26:49.649 --> 26:50.525
You.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.405
-Don't fuck with me, Azumi.
-[Azumi] I'm not, James.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.365
[clears throat]

26:58.158 --> 26:59.701
We need your help to finish.

27:02.746 --> 27:06.207
Of course I'll need several minutes
to get my affairs in order, but...

27:07.584 --> 27:08.418
yes.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.131
I'll be right outside.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.637
[rustling]

28:02.097 --> 28:03.181
[sniffing]

28:05.725 --> 28:06.559
[sighs]

28:07.602 --> 28:10.522
When is this fucking horse gonna die?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.132
I don't have my security card.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.224
Thank you for braving
the outside world for me.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.560
Thank you for inventing this treatment.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.567
Does Gertie know I'm here?

28:57.360 --> 28:59.320
I haven't had a chance to tell her yet.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.351
[inhales deeply]

29:32.896 --> 29:33.730
Hello.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.608
It's...

29:39.778 --> 29:41.404
excellent to see you again.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.948
[GRTA] <i>James.</i>

29:45.116 --> 29:47.243
<i>What a nice surprise!</i>

29:48.203 --> 29:49.662
Are you gonna show your face?

29:53.416 --> 29:54.292
All right.

29:58.087 --> 29:58.922
Oh...

30:01.216 --> 30:05.220
By the way, I thought you should hear it
from me first that Dr. Muramoto is dead.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.596
[GRTA] <i>Oh!</i>

30:06.679 --> 30:08.765
And I'm once again at the helm of this...

30:10.058 --> 30:10.892
project.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.019
[GRTA] <i>I see.</i>

30:14.145 --> 30:15.730
<i>Thank you for telling me.</i>

30:31.538 --> 30:33.873
Did Muramoto have access
to a beta headset?

30:34.833 --> 30:35.667
Yes.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.503
Sometimes he used it
when they were red flags. Why?

30:39.629 --> 30:41.965
I'll address the subjects tomorrow myself.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.051
They can't be spooked by a death.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.095
And sometimes the arrival
of a new authority figure

30:47.178 --> 30:48.555
could be equally upsetting.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.473
Either is a data taint.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.767
Last thing we want is a data taint.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.352
Yeah.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.396
We need all the data we can get.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.315
Number Five...

31:01.568 --> 31:03.403
he just brought rubbers, so...

31:05.154 --> 31:06.447
he can stay, right?

31:11.911 --> 31:12.829
Azumi.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.122
[Azumi] Yes.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.752
When an addict dies,
do you think it's suicide?

31:22.088 --> 31:24.257
I believe Robert was optimistic.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.554
I think he just made a mistake.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.558
[Azumi] Good morning.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.896
Could I have everyone's attention
for a moment?

34:27.732 --> 34:31.569
My name... [clears throat]
is Dr. James K. Mantleray.

34:32.153 --> 34:37.909
Unfortunately, Dr. Muramoto
has had a family emergency,

34:38.451 --> 34:41.120
so I will personally be assuming
oversight duties

34:41.204 --> 34:42.955

34:44.415 --> 34:46.501
Uh, I believe in this treatment.

34:48.211 --> 34:51.172
And I believe in the idea
that we can all be...

34:53.424 --> 34:54.258
uh...

34:55.051 --> 34:55.927

Pain...

34:59.430 --> 35:01.057
uh, can be destroyed.

35:01.641 --> 35:05.144
But it can't without trials
like this, so...

35:06.604 --> 35:10.858
I guess I want to thank you all
for being the brave explorers...

35:11.901 --> 35:13.069

for any of them to be nervous.
