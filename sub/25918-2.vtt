WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:12.971
[Genevieve] In this episode,
we're off to sunny Southern California.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.264
Malibu!

00:14.347 --> 00:16.891
[Peter] This beach-side bungalow is on
Billionaire Row.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.936
This is absolute real estate gold.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.771
The location is luxury,

00:21.855 --> 00:24.274
but this vacation rental is lousy.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.608
This is not luxury.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.569
-I can't close the gate!
-Major issue.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.406
[Genevieve] We'll transform her property
into a deluxe stay.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.783
Your kitchen is under a major renovation.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.909
Holy [bleep]!

00:34.993 --> 00:36.953
[Peter] This is
the Malibu lifestyle moment.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.622
[Genevieve] From celebrity chefs
to gourmet kitchens.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.126
Oh, my God! It is amazing!

00:43.209 --> 00:44.794
To Sharone, and new beginnings.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.862
What I love about Malibu is it's a place
where celebrities and surfers

01:10.945 --> 01:13.656
define a one-of-a-kind luxury lifestyle.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.660
Here we are. Malibu!

01:17.744 --> 01:19.913
[Genevieve]
Just up the coast from Los Angeles

01:19.996 --> 01:23.541
is one of the most famous beach towns
in the world: Malibu, California,

01:23.625 --> 01:27.587
a year-round destination for stars,
surfers, and travelers.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.757
That means it's a booming market
for vacation rentals.

01:30.840 --> 01:34.010
When people hear Malibu,
they think surfing,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.763
they probably think celebrity homes.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.849
It's also a legitimate business
for short-term rental.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.809
What are the numbers?

01:40.892 --> 01:44.395
There are approximately
300 single-family residences

01:44.479 --> 01:45.688
that you can rent now.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.900
But that small little chunk of homes

01:48.983 --> 01:52.445
generated $40 million a year
at about 1,000 a night.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.365
Carbon Beach,
which is full of celebrities,

01:55.448 --> 01:58.451
you can rent a house for $100,000 a month.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.537
I can't with that... I... No.

02:01.913 --> 02:05.542
The thing I'm loving about our project
 is the house is on Malibu Road,

02:05.625 --> 02:07.502
which is beautiful.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.922
-Our road is a bit secluded.
-I love that the ocean's right there.

02:11.005 --> 02:14.717
This is a fantastic A+, five-star location

02:14.801 --> 02:17.470
with a  house
that's in terrible condition.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.264
It's listed as a short-term rental.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.599
It's at $1,500 a night.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.935
It has one bedroom, two baths,

02:24.018 --> 02:26.396
and it's right on the water
at Malibu Road.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.233
Look at the exterior of the house,
it's beat up and the kitchen is awful.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.569
Dark and cluttered.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.948
She tried to get $1,500 a night
and didn't get one rental.

02:37.031 --> 02:41.327
But the thing I love about this space
is it obviously has enormous potential.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.038
You're surrounded by
multi-million-dollar properties.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.959
This is the crooked tooth
on a perfect smile.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.711
But we can fix that.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.838
Are you ready to go to Sharone's?

02:51.921 --> 02:53.590
Let's go to Malibu Road.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.101
[Peter] Malibu Road is one of
the most exclusive addresses in Malibu

03:05.185 --> 03:06.603
and if you rent a home here,

03:06.686 --> 03:08.396
you're living like a celebrity.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.442
Unless you're staying here.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.777
Well, can't argue with the location.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.239
The location, for me, is mind-blowing.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.617
I'm not getting any sense of luxury.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.870
It just feels like somebody's old house
on the beach.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.956
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.959
Hi, Sharone, nice to meet you.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.921
-How are you?
-I've heard so much about you guys.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.088
Who's this?

03:34.172 --> 03:36.090
Lola is my rescue pup.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.010
She's the queen of Malibu Road.
I'm the mayor, she's the queen.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.303
Tell us about the house.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.804
The house is old.

03:41.888 --> 03:45.516
My name is Sharone Karsh.
I live on Malibu Road,

03:45.600 --> 03:48.394
the best street in Malibu.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.689
Maybe not the most beautiful house
on Malibu Road.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.526
So far, my home-- I've not had
a lot of luck in the rental department.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.904
I've tried to rent it out a little bit,

03:57.987 --> 04:01.908
but it's been weathered a lot
from the ocean.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.368
I've been struggling to keep it up.

04:03.451 --> 04:07.205
My husband had the house
and he passed away a year and a half ago.

04:07.288 --> 04:12.752
It's been a difficult time for me
and it was really hard.

04:12.835 --> 04:15.088
It has not been an easy year.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.966
If you've never had a loss
of a loved one,

04:18.048 --> 04:19.884
you really don't know the feeling

04:19.968 --> 04:22.262
because you're with them
every day of your life

04:22.345 --> 04:23.596
and...

04:28.226 --> 04:31.437
I'm finally feeling that I can let go.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.983
I don't want to move.
I want to be able to enjoy the house

04:35.066 --> 04:38.236
and be able to have other people enjoy it

04:38.319 --> 04:39.737
and be able to travel.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.824
In a perfect world, how long would you
live in the house each year

04:42.907 --> 04:44.325
and how long would you rent it?

04:44.409 --> 04:48.121
I love the winters here.
I would love to be here in the winter,

04:48.204 --> 04:49.872
and in the summer, travel.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.876
I'm reaching out to Gen and Peter
right now because my house is a shambles.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.671
I definitely need help
in the business department.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.298
-Take us in.
-Let's go.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.465
Show us your house.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.970
Wow. Sharone, this is not luxury, my dear.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.432
If I was paying 1,500 a night for this,

05:07.515 --> 05:09.600
no offence, I would be doing this.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.353
-I'm leaving.
-No offence taken.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.189
-I can't even close the gate!
-Major issue!

05:15.315 --> 05:18.026
-What else have we got?
-Let's go in.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.694
Come on, Lola.

05:23.531 --> 05:27.910
I mean for real, Sharone, like what?!

05:27.994 --> 05:29.704
That is the money shot there.

05:29.787 --> 05:30.872
Oh, my God!

05:31.414 --> 05:34.459
Alright, one bedroom on this side

05:34.542 --> 05:35.918
and a den off the kitchen.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.337
I need to go outside.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.172
I don't want to be in the house

05:39.255 --> 05:42.216
when you have something like this.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.384
Oh, my God.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.678
This is enormous.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.766
-Think I have the biggest deck in Malibu.
-I think you might.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.893
Deck size matters
when you live in Malibu.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.397
So this, for me,
is absolute real estate gold.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.734
Tell me about how things wear out here.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.236
Things wear very badly.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.238
This is brand-spanking-new.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.240
The ocean eats away everything.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.493
I'm only 40 years old.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.661
[laughing]

06:10.745 --> 06:15.750
These things can wreck an experience for
someone who paid so much to stay here.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.003
They'll focus on this...
instead of this.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.339
I'm also newly single

06:21.422 --> 06:23.341
and I don't know
how to fix things up.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.177
-I'm very like...
-I do.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.220
You have...

06:27.345 --> 06:30.723
Do you want to get married?
I feel like this would really work!

06:32.141 --> 06:33.684
-We're going in.
-Take us in.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.686
Uh-oh. Come on in.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.107
This feels incredibly personal.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.192
Everywhere I look, I see you.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.694
There's a lot of booze over there.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.238
A lot of good booze!

06:45.321 --> 06:47.824
This feels like Sharone's party pad

06:47.907 --> 06:49.867
rather than luxury.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.953
It needs to be depersonalized.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.581
When you're in a hotel, you don't want
to feel like you're in somebody's room.

06:56.999 --> 07:01.337
This is interesting because
you want to live here half the year

07:01.421 --> 07:03.673
and you want to rent it out
the other half.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.468
I don't want to depersonalize completely.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.721
We just have a place where
you can put that when you're not home

07:10.805 --> 07:12.807
and when you're home it comes back out.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.519
I want to dig into the Achilles heel
of your house.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.397
That is this kitchen
in the little tiny corner.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.108
I'm looking at inside that cabinet

07:22.191 --> 07:24.861
this little lady, this stack,

07:24.944 --> 07:26.279
no counter space.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.573
Alright, can I open your fridge?

07:30.783 --> 07:33.369
It's full of half-eaten...

07:33.453 --> 07:34.787
Crab claws.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.082
Well, I can snack on some batteries maybe?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.295
Nothing about this fridge
makes me want to eat anything in it.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.838
No offence.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.258
But when you have people,
you'd leave an empty fridge.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.426
You would have water.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.553
-Water.
-You would have white wine.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.556
If we're doing luxury,
I would leave a bottle of champagne.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.849
A nice one.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.142
Let's dig into the design.

07:56.225 --> 08:00.605
To convert this into a luxury rental,
we need to make this kitchen bigger.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.524
First idea is taking out
all these uppers,

08:03.608 --> 08:05.109
taking this pot rack out.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.945
-Alright, beautiful.
-And extending this kitchen

08:08.029 --> 08:10.865
all the way down to the end there.

08:10.948 --> 08:14.494
Make an island that goes this way,
the long way,

08:14.577 --> 08:17.455
so we can be cooking at any point
and see that,

08:17.538 --> 08:18.414
That's the show.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.627
This is entertainment paradise.
You feeling it?

08:22.710 --> 08:25.796
-Yes.
-Let's talk about what luxury is.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.758
The five-star traveler
has high expectations.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.552
And so the difference between
a $200 a night place

08:31.636 --> 08:33.804
is that you're gonna have to do some work.

08:33.888 --> 08:37.808
For this price,
I expect me to want for nothing

08:37.892 --> 08:39.101
and to sit by that ocean

08:39.184 --> 08:41.895
and popping a bottle of whatever
when I want it.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.357
If I don't have those comforts,
where am I going?

08:44.440 --> 08:47.527
You're going to go down the block
to the hotel.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.111
Master bedroom, let's do it.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.658
The master has a great view.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.743
-Yes.
-You have a gym in here too.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.954
-I do.
-Here's the thing that troubles me.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.040
I'm flying here from Europe,
I'm dropping 1,500 a night,

09:01.123 --> 09:02.875
I walk into my master suite,

09:02.959 --> 09:06.587
you're reminding me of how fat I am
and that I should be working.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.756
I don't need these items
in my master bedroom.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.675
I think we're all on the same page.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.843
-Let's go to your den.
-Yeah, let's go.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.721
This is the den.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.932
-There's a lot of big furniture.
-Yeah.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.393
On a business tip,
this room is a pretty room.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.978
We've got great light coming in.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.773
We absolutely need to change this
into a bedroom.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.693
The profit you get is directly linked
to heads in beds.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.737
Right now, you have a one-bedroom
house on the beach.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.864
If we turn this room into a bedroom suite,

09:33.948 --> 09:37.076
two couples can rent the whole place
for 1,500 bucks

09:37.159 --> 09:38.869
but only pay 750 each.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.955
-What a deal.
-So your occupancy will go up.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.583
Let's do our business plan.
Shall we go out on the deck?

09:43.666 --> 09:44.750
Let's do it.

09:45.710 --> 09:50.965
I know you tried to rent this place before
and you didn't have much success.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.258
No success.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.468
The problem is the location is luxury,

09:54.552 --> 09:56.137
the label is luxury,

09:56.220 --> 09:57.888
the experience is not luxury.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.057
So I want to recap your goals.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.268
You want to rent this
for six months of the year,

10:02.351 --> 10:05.354
-live in it for six months.
-Absolutely.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.566
Owning a house in Malibu
is very expensive.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.567
I have a mortgage,

10:09.650 --> 10:12.111
there's a lot of repairs.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.322
As we know, money doesn't grow on trees,

10:14.405 --> 10:17.408
and I don't really have an income
since my husband passed away.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.577
-Let's talk about the numbers.
-Okay.

10:19.660 --> 10:23.748
Approximately $40 million was generated

10:23.831 --> 10:25.916
in short-term rentals in Malibu

10:26.000 --> 10:27.168
in the past year.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.628
That's only 300 homes.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.795
Wow.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.297
With an average nightly

10:31.380 --> 10:33.674
of approximately $1,000.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.718
They're in the hills
and they've got great views

10:35.801 --> 10:38.220
but it isn't the true
California beach experience.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.931
Single-family homes on the sand like yours

10:41.015 --> 10:43.184
can get $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 a night
and up.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.353
Your location, I feel,

10:45.436 --> 10:50.733
once Gen's done her design,
we've got all your business tightened up,

10:50.816 --> 10:55.279
your $1,500 is a really competitive number
to be on the sand.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.907
If you book 22 days a month,

10:57.990 --> 10:59.492
which is typical for Malibu,

10:59.575 --> 11:02.286
you'll bring in approximately
33 grand a month.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.288
So for the six months you're renting,

11:04.372 --> 11:06.248
that's 200 grand almost,

11:06.332 --> 11:08.709
which will enable you to have
all your costs paid

11:08.793 --> 11:10.503
and then you're living the dream.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.962
It's a real business.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.674
Peter, don't take me personally,

11:14.757 --> 11:16.842
but I want to make sure
you've done your homework.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.553
How do I know that that is what
I'm going to be able to get?

11:19.637 --> 11:22.098
I know 'cause I've sold a whole bunch
of celebrities' houses

11:22.181 --> 11:24.183
within a stone's throw of here

11:24.266 --> 11:26.686
and successfully listed them
as vacation rentals.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.021
To get to where Peter wants you to be,

11:29.105 --> 11:32.441
we've got to invest in some
big home improvements.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.611
Kitchen, outdoor, house in itself.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.364
Are you ready to let go
and invest in that?

11:38.447 --> 11:40.282
I'm 100% in.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.702
-Alright.
-Let's do this.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.381
[Peter] Here's our business goal
for the beach house on Malibu Road:

11:55.464 --> 11:59.093
To deliver a luxury rental on the sand
at a competitive price.

11:59.176 --> 12:02.221
To do that,
we'll redesign the kitchen area

12:02.304 --> 12:05.516
and the ocean-side deck
to make this an entertainer's dream.

12:05.599 --> 12:10.104
And convert the den into a second bedroom
to help travelers reduce their costs.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.273
Next, we'll source luxury amenities

12:12.356 --> 12:16.318
for one of the most important places
in a short-term rental: the bedroom.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.863
And finally, when you're a host in Malibu,

12:18.946 --> 12:22.324
you have to learn what it takes
to satisfy the upscale traveler.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.702
We'll show Sharone how to do that.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.789
[Genevieve] The renovation is under way.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.918
Jane, five minutes, ready for flatware
to be packed away.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.379
This is great. You bubble wrap.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.093
First step in our redesign
is to clear out the clutter

12:41.177 --> 12:43.012
so we can create a new kitchen area.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.348
Even some of Sharone's best friends
have come to help

12:46.432 --> 12:47.767
with this big life transition.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.351
Do you need help in the middle?

12:49.435 --> 12:52.772
Careful. We're saving these cabinets
to use for later.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.400
Here's what we're doing.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.986
We're going to move
the existing door to the den

12:59.069 --> 13:01.238
all the way into
the far left corner of that wall.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.366
This will enable us to expand
the counter top

13:04.450 --> 13:07.620
all the way along the wall
and create a larger kitchen island.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.957
These are the first steps
to making this beach house more luxurious.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.628
Oh, boy!

13:15.711 --> 13:16.837
Watch your toes.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.506
OMG!

13:18.589 --> 13:21.050
Your kitchen is under
major, major renovation.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.510
Holy [bleep]!

13:22.593 --> 13:25.471
-I promise we will...
-This is scary!

13:25.554 --> 13:27.890
Trust us. We will not let you down.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.433
I think this is about time!

13:29.517 --> 13:32.812
We have been trying to get Sharone
to renovate for years.

13:32.937 --> 13:33.813
Is that true?

13:33.896 --> 13:37.107
This is going to be a great start,
a purge of stuff she doesn't need.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.276
A start-over, a do-over.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.945
We're going to show you some experiences

13:41.028 --> 13:43.656
that are going to help you as a host
with the guests

13:43.739 --> 13:45.115
that come and stay.

13:45.199 --> 13:49.245
-That sounds fun. I'm game.
-Okay, let's go.

13:49.328 --> 13:53.791
[Genevieve] Malibu isn't just a place,
it's a lifestyle filled with contrast.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.544
It's a mash-up of billionaires
and bohemians.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.587
I've got the million-dollar smoothie.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.715
It's celebrity hot spots
as well as a surfer's paradise.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.385
It's electric bikes and open water yoga.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.514
The design of Sharone's beach rental
has to reflect this laid-back luxury.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.517
The place to go for that is here:
Malibu Design Center.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.102
Hi!

14:13.185 --> 14:15.938
My favorite room. Amy, how are you?

14:16.021 --> 14:17.773
Good to see you.

14:17.857 --> 14:22.903
So we want to create
this cocoon of Malibu.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.738
You've come to the right place.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.825
The furniture has to have that aesthetic

14:27.908 --> 14:30.244
the five-star traveler expects.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.664
I would love to know,
you guys being more local,

14:33.747 --> 14:37.918
what specifically defines
some of the characteristics

14:38.002 --> 14:39.503
that make it Malibu style?

14:39.587 --> 14:41.964
Malibu is casual,

14:42.047 --> 14:43.674
contemporary,

14:43.757 --> 14:45.217
beach lifestyle.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.969
We don't have animal product

14:47.052 --> 14:49.054
because it's kind of a no-no
in Malibu.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.014
No leathers...

14:50.097 --> 14:52.308
Correct, correct.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.311
So then the other thing
with the beach lifestyle

14:55.394 --> 14:57.563
-we always suggest white...
-I do too.

14:57.646 --> 14:58.981
...because you can bleach it.

14:59.064 --> 15:03.986
Do you think the palette is defined by
so much color coming from the ocean

15:04.069 --> 15:06.488
and the natural setting
that you pull back

15:06.572 --> 15:08.449
-the palette in the house.
-Absolutely.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.451
All right, we need to shop.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.828
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.750
More expensive doesn't mean more stuff.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.003
In fact, it means less stuff,
higher quality.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.672
Like, this is a minimal-style bed,

15:23.756 --> 15:25.591
but you know when you see the texture,

15:25.674 --> 15:26.717
this is expensive.

15:28.552 --> 15:31.263
So, one thing that short-term renters,

15:31.347 --> 15:33.849
regardless of if they're in Malibu or not,

15:33.933 --> 15:36.894
is slip covers are
a really important tool.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.730
You can bleach white slip covers.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.441
It's the color that everyone
is the most scared to spill on

15:42.524 --> 15:44.068
but it's the easiest to clean.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.862
-This is great advice.
-Bleach is your friend.

15:46.946 --> 15:47.988
Bleach is my friend.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.492
There is one item that we haven't
sourced yet for the house.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.536
It's what also comes in
with high-end living

15:54.620 --> 15:56.538
and high-end staying,

15:56.622 --> 15:59.208
-and that means art.
-Art.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.834
I love all the art in here.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.755
[Peter] While Gen is working
on the design element,

16:04.838 --> 16:07.049
I'm on the hunt to find
a special piece for the deck

16:07.132 --> 16:09.551
that will really pop
in Sharone's online listing.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.305
We need to show luxury
in the first photo they see.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.267
I think I've found the front cover
of the marketing brochure.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.646
These chairs with the ocean behind

16:20.729 --> 16:21.855
at the sunset.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.983
Nothing says luxury more than that.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.068
If I'm clicking through properties,

16:26.151 --> 16:28.237
I'll be like, yeah, that draws me in,

16:28.320 --> 16:31.198
it makes me want to research
that property more

16:31.281 --> 16:33.742
and then if everything else
meets my expectations,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.411
I'm going to book that one.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.829
-I love these guys.
-Done.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.877
[Genevieve] We have made
some serious progress on the build.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.170
Can we do five?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.588
Yes.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.717
To deliver the feel of a boutique hotel
at the beach,

16:49.800 --> 16:53.554
we're painting the exterior of the house
a chic, dark peppercorn color

16:53.637 --> 16:55.556
to hide its imperfections.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.809
I'll use Moroccan tiles
and long-lasting teak woods

16:58.892 --> 17:02.062
and comfortable, cozy linens
for all the beds.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.025
We're also building a pergola
on the deck

17:06.108 --> 17:08.027
to create an ideal social media moment.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.154
I actually love this spot.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.321
-I think the spot is--
-The corner is okay?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.992
-I would hang out here.
-It's ten feet.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.661
If I'm looking at this in London,

17:17.744 --> 17:20.622
and I see two of those beautiful chairs

17:20.705 --> 17:22.708
hanging here in front of the ocean,

17:22.790 --> 17:25.085
that's the first place I'll sit
when I get here.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.962
And my view is right there.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.840
That's what will make the guests
very happy.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.352
[Genevieve] For a short-term rental,
luxury begins in the bedroom.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.146
You want your guests to sleep well,

17:44.229 --> 17:45.522
wake up happy,

17:45.606 --> 17:47.399
and leave a great review.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.401
-Hey.
-How are you?

17:49.485 --> 17:52.029
That's why I'm taking Sharone
to meet an expert

17:52.112 --> 17:56.158
who can teach her a few things
about what goes into a luxury bedroom.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.410
We're going to talk about the art
of luxury bedding.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.954
Our guide today is Ariel.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.958
She deals specifically
with the kind of customer,

18:05.042 --> 18:07.461
that you want to come to your house.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.214
These linens are the kind of linens

18:10.297 --> 18:12.382
we need in a luxury Airbnb.

18:12.466 --> 18:16.178
I was inspired originally
by my travels in Italy

18:16.261 --> 18:20.390
sleeping in beds that I didn't even know
were possible

18:20.474 --> 18:21.642
in terms of comfort.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.019
When I came back,
I wanted to recreate that.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.356
but I looked everywhere and couldn't find
anything that was accessibly priced.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.567
I believe that sleep and comfort
and luxury bedding

18:30.651 --> 18:32.111
should be accessible to anyone.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.071
I don't care if it's budget or high-end,

18:34.154 --> 18:36.073
if we don't sleep well,

18:36.156 --> 18:38.242
the whole thing is off.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.243
I agree.

18:39.326 --> 18:43.205
When you have short-term rentals,
you go through things.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.750
Lower quality products dissipate
after a few washes

18:46.834 --> 18:49.753
and that's when you get pilling
or things start to rip.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.213
And so that won't happen.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.965
-We're taking care of you today.
-Okay.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.804
How about having a couple of these?

18:58.887 --> 19:00.597
These are awesome.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.599
I think nothing says luxury
like a bathrobe.

19:02.683 --> 19:06.645
These are the kind of details
luxury hotels have mastered.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.772
You should use them in your rental.

19:09.523 --> 19:13.735
I am so blown away by those waffle robes

19:13.819 --> 19:14.987
and the slippers.

19:15.070 --> 19:18.407
It screams like, oh, my God,
this is five star.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.493
How many sets of sheets do you think
you need for each bedroom?

19:21.577 --> 19:23.579
I think maybe three, four?

19:23.662 --> 19:25.122
I would recommend three per room.

19:25.205 --> 19:28.167
That way if you're washing one or two
during the stay,

19:28.250 --> 19:29.751
you have an extra on hand

19:29.835 --> 19:32.754
and you don't have to scramble
to get something special.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.922
If one gets ruined.

19:34.006 --> 19:38.093
Bedding is a place where you never
pull back on budget.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.678
Sounds like a real investment.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.305
It is a great investment, exactly.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.398
[Genevieve] Back at the house,
we're bringing in new deck furniture

19:51.481 --> 19:54.693
to create a beautiful outdoor
living experience for all the guests.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.321
This looks like a new table.

19:57.404 --> 20:01.283
And we're restoring some of Sharone's
old pieces to save where we can.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.911
How often would you say to do this?

20:03.994 --> 20:05.537
-Every season?
-Oh, yeah, for sure.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.914
It feels like a new table.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.082
That's what I really like about it.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.213
[Peter] When you're hosting
upscale travelers from around the world,

20:14.296 --> 20:17.925
you need to know how to handle their needs
from start to finish.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.305
-Oh, my goodness.
-What do you think?

20:23.388 --> 20:26.433
-This is quite the scene.
-Isn't it?

20:26.516 --> 20:30.020
So we brought Sharone
to this mountain-top villa

20:30.103 --> 20:34.233
to experience high-end hosting
from two experts in the field.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.027
This is a luxury food experience

20:37.110 --> 20:39.821
that you can offer your guests
at your house.

20:39.905 --> 20:44.952
The concept here is a communal,
artistic way of having hors d'oeuvres.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.537
Think of this as your plate.
This is a tomato puree

20:47.621 --> 20:48.872
that's going across the plate.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.291
I've never seen anything quite like this.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.710
The thing I like about this is
it's drawing us in.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.045
It's not just serving us.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.255
Yes, exactly.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.967
We are a catering company offering
the best of what a restaurant has to offer

21:00.050 --> 21:02.594
in terms of food and culinary execution

21:02.678 --> 21:03.804
and service.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.515
But setting it in a non-restaurant
environment like this.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.183
No walls, beautiful setting.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.811
We find these experiences create a memory.

21:10.894 --> 21:11.937
All the way in.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.021
There you go.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.857
-Oh, my God.
-Really?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.443
Tonight's obviously an amazing experience

21:18.527 --> 21:21.321
but this is something that
can be replicated at Sharone's home

21:21.405 --> 21:23.782
for her guests who are staying
at her beach villa

21:23.865 --> 21:27.577
on any typical night that will create
memories, why they want to come back.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.871
And John is going to be telling us

21:29.955 --> 21:35.168
how to nurture and deliver the best
first impressions you can give your guests

21:35.252 --> 21:37.045
when they're staying at the beach house.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.630
Shall we enjoy dinner?

21:40.007 --> 21:42.050
I want to talk about, with John,

21:42.134 --> 21:47.431
the importance of anticipating the guests'
psyche through staging and smells.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.267
I'd recommend to understand as much

21:50.350 --> 21:52.269
about the guest as you possibly can.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.063
Do I have a questionnaire before
people rent the place

21:55.147 --> 21:58.108
so I know if they eat organic?

21:58.191 --> 21:59.609
That would be amazing.

21:59.693 --> 22:02.070
Why not partner with
a local shopping service.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.489
They could charge $100

22:04.573 --> 22:06.700
and here's a list
of all the things available

22:06.783 --> 22:08.785
so when you come in,
imagine how easy it would be.

22:08.869 --> 22:12.956
Water, all of your food, all the way down
to, how are you looking to exercise?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.417
You need to think what you would expect

22:15.500 --> 22:18.879
when you check in a five-star experience,
you need to deliver for your guests.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.799
The gents are coming around with
a little tomato snow.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.260
It looks intimidating.
Don't be intimidated.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.929
I have never had tomato snow!

22:28.013 --> 22:29.473
-Bon appetit.
-Bon appetit.

22:29.556 --> 22:32.476
You guys came in and changing
my whole life right now

22:32.559 --> 22:34.227
and it's all going to be for the better

22:34.311 --> 22:37.731
and I've grown in heaps and bounds
in the last few days.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.524
-It's been amazing.
-To Sharone.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.735
To Sharone.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.153
To new beginnings.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.916
This is all glassware.

22:55.999 --> 23:00.379
[Genevieve] With final details in place,
the beach house is ready for its close up.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.255
Cozy fur pods.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.638
[Peter] If Sharone wants to sell
a five-star Malibu beach experience,

23:09.721 --> 23:13.308
the photos on her listing
need to communicate that right away.

23:14.267 --> 23:17.229
Master bedroom, arguably the most
important room in the house.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.689
Now that says luxury. Perfect.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.985
Iconic. This is the marketing moment.

23:24.069 --> 23:27.781
I want everybody to feel like
they can come here

23:27.864 --> 23:30.200
and have the total Malibu experience.
-Got it.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.248
With the photo shoot in the bag,

23:36.331 --> 23:40.752
it's time to reintroduce Sharone
to her new beach house vacation rental.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.629
No peeking.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.257
-Hang on.
-Oh, my God.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.259
-Are you ready?
-I think so!

23:49.177 --> 23:50.470
Oh, my God!

23:51.513 --> 23:54.391
-This is my house?
-Yeah.

23:54.474 --> 23:57.310
So, if you remember when we were here
a few days ago,

23:57.394 --> 24:01.231
you could see all the marks,
all the age, all the wear and tear.

24:01.314 --> 24:05.944
And now you have a sophisticated
entrance to your property.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.612
Clean and nice and like...

24:07.696 --> 24:08.947
-Do you like the color?
-Yes!

24:09.030 --> 24:11.116
I thought it would be white!

24:11.199 --> 24:13.243
By painting it this darker peppercorn,

24:13.326 --> 24:15.787
we've really masked its age.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.122
It got a beautiful face-lift.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.665
Let's go inside.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.459
No more wobbly fence.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.211
Wow, that was scary.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.672
We have completely anchored
the entire fence.

24:25.755 --> 24:28.008
-Come inside.
-Oh, my God. Yes.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.927
Oh, my God!

24:31.595 --> 24:34.556
Holy [bleep]!

24:35.348 --> 24:36.850
Is this my house?

24:36.933 --> 24:39.102
-It is.
-This is your house.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.354
I love this!

24:41.438 --> 24:43.940
This is fricking amazing!

24:44.024 --> 24:45.734
There's more stuff

24:45.817 --> 24:47.277
and it feels roomier

24:47.360 --> 24:49.362
because the space plan changed.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.033
Instead of crowding all of the weight
into this one corner,

24:53.116 --> 24:55.827
we've spread it out.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.287
There used to be a door there.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.415
-Yes. Oh, my God.
-That's over there.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.501
That's right.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.794
All your cabinets from the island,
we took up

25:04.878 --> 25:07.088
and we put along this wall.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.634
So we saved you a lot of money
by recycling and re-purposing

25:10.717 --> 25:12.636
all of your old cabinets.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.971
I'd be paying a fricking fortune for this.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.557
That is the whole point.
If you remember,

25:17.641 --> 25:20.143
this did not feel like luxury at all.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.645
And now what do you feel?

25:21.728 --> 25:23.104
I feel like a queen.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.440
It feels like a five-star experience,
right?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.944
This place is bitching!

25:29.694 --> 25:32.364
For your guests,
you'll personalize to them,

25:32.447 --> 25:35.033
so their experience
as soon as they walk in--

25:35.116 --> 25:37.077
Make them feel like I feel right now.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.329
-Yes!
-Amazing!

25:39.412 --> 25:40.413
You got it.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.667
Now, if you remember
the ghastly situation.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.461
Wow!

25:46.545 --> 25:47.963
That's clean!

25:48.046 --> 25:49.422
-Right?
-Yes.

25:49.506 --> 25:54.135
So, five-star travelers expect luxury
and your place is luxury within reach.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.263
We've got super bubbly, semi-bubbly,

25:56.346 --> 25:58.682
we got flat, we have champagne.

25:58.765 --> 26:01.643
We've got your super special
Malibu chocolate.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.811
Lucky them!

26:02.894 --> 26:04.854
When you leave, what do you write?

26:04.938 --> 26:06.898
-A five-star...
-Review.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.650
-Thanks.
-Flawless.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.820
There is so much to learn

26:11.903 --> 26:13.113
in the luxury world.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.906
We're going to the master bedroom.

26:14.990 --> 26:15.949
Oh, my God!

26:18.243 --> 26:19.244
Oh, my God.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.662
Wow!

26:20.745 --> 26:22.914
It's beautiful!

26:22.998 --> 26:25.542
This is my same room?

26:25.625 --> 26:26.710
Yeah.

26:26.793 --> 26:30.005
Oh, my God, it's so... It's...

26:30.088 --> 26:31.673
I'm feeling...

26:33.550 --> 26:36.386
-Are you at a loss for words?
-I am. I never am.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.263
But I didn't expect this.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.681
When I walked in here before,

26:39.764 --> 26:43.101
I was reminded how fat I was
because there was a cycling machine.

26:43.184 --> 26:44.853
Now, I walk in

26:44.936 --> 26:46.021
and there's an experience.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.606
I know this is Parachute again.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.733
-Yes, it is.
-I can feel it.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.526
-We got linen and percale--
-You got this!

26:51.610 --> 26:53.820
[laughing]

26:55.071 --> 26:57.991
You also have your same bed
with a new headboard.

26:58.074 --> 27:00.160
You have a foldaway bed

27:00.243 --> 27:02.203
-So, if there are extra people--
-I do?

27:02.287 --> 27:03.580
That is a foldaway bed.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.957
I could even put more people here.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.626
Are you ready to see more?

27:09.336 --> 27:10.462
Can you take it?

27:10.545 --> 27:12.255
Do you need a drink, Sharone?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.382
This is crazy.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.886
Oh, my God, it's so different.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.220
Right?

27:19.304 --> 27:23.600
The purpose of this room
has changed so much.

27:23.683 --> 27:27.020
Remember we are a business,
so we've got heads in beds.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.522
When we came here,
it was a one-bedroom.

27:29.606 --> 27:33.234
You were trying to rent this place
and having no luck.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.612
Now we have a separate suite

27:35.695 --> 27:37.238
with its own entrance.

27:37.322 --> 27:41.743
So if you've got two couples
that want to rent, 1,500 a night,

27:41.826 --> 27:45.747
now it's 750 each
to be on the sand in Malibu.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.625
Now your home is not just a home,
it's a business.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.669
-Happy?
-Yes. It's gorgeous.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.212
Wanna see some more?

27:52.754 --> 27:55.048
Okay, this is where all the fun is.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.343
-I mean...
-Oh, my God!

27:58.426 --> 27:59.678
Wow!

27:59.761 --> 28:01.596
Look at that!

28:04.474 --> 28:05.767
You recognize it?

28:05.850 --> 28:06.893
No!

28:06.976 --> 28:08.978
Does it feel five-star?

28:09.062 --> 28:12.190
-Yes!
-Go look around.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.442
Oh, my God!

28:14.526 --> 28:15.610
I love it.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.195
The bar.

28:17.278 --> 28:21.157
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna live in these chairs.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.786
Incredible.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.621
This is the Malibu lifestyle moment.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.791
I want everybody to feel
that they can come here,

28:29.874 --> 28:31.251
sit in these seats,

28:31.334 --> 28:32.669
stare at the ocean

28:32.752 --> 28:34.963
and have the total Malibu experience.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.673
This is the social media moment.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.758
You deliver it in spades.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.301
I think I do.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.929
-And then they deliver you...
-Killer reviews.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.223
This was not the way it was.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.725
This is perfection.

28:46.808 --> 28:50.019
Okay, so I want to break it down
to some business.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.564
Can we market your property now?

28:52.647 --> 28:54.607
-Is there a story here?
-Hell, yeah.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.818
Operations. Does it work for your guests?

28:56.901 --> 28:58.153
Of course it does.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.320
Design.

28:59.779 --> 29:00.989
Say no more.

29:01.781 --> 29:04.284
And then the last part
is experiences.

29:04.367 --> 29:09.080
Everything has to be a perfect,
anticipated experience.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.457
Peter, it will be.

29:10.540 --> 29:14.335
So, Sharone, we've invited
just a few of your mates here...

29:16.004 --> 29:19.841
...to help you kick off new beginnings
in your fabulous new house.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.178
Oh, my God!

29:25.388 --> 29:27.307
This is my sister, everybody!

29:30.226 --> 29:32.103
You've got the same hair.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.980
Thank you, guys!

29:34.063 --> 29:36.900
It was really hard getting over
my husband dying,

29:36.983 --> 29:39.736
having a partner,
being with somebody all the time.

29:39.819 --> 29:42.864
This is, like, so cathartic.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.200
It's a new chapter of my life.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.286
I feel like I can move on now.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.662
Three cheers for Sharone.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.873
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

29:51.956 --> 29:53.833
Hip, hip! Hooray!

29:53.917 --> 29:56.544
Hip, hip! Hooray!

29:56.628 --> 29:59.714
Thank you everybody!

29:59.798 --> 30:03.718
[Peter] Now it's time to go live
and launch the new property listing.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.762
Live like a star for a few days

30:05.845 --> 30:08.723
in this pristinely redesigned
luxury bungalow

30:08.807 --> 30:12.185
designed to provide a five-star lifestyle
without breaking the bank.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.896
Featuring an over-sized communal kitchen,

30:14.979 --> 30:17.732
and unlimited vistas of the Pacific

30:17.816 --> 30:20.151
from the opulent outdoor
entertainment deck

30:20.235 --> 30:24.656
that gives you another living space
to watch the sun dip behind the ocean.

30:24.739 --> 30:27.200
Every desire has been anticipated

30:27.283 --> 30:29.744
so the Beach House on Malibu Road

30:29.828 --> 30:31.955
will provide memories and experiences

30:32.038 --> 30:33.832
that will last a lifetime.
