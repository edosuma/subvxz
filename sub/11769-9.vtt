LARRY, NO.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.433

00:26.467 --> 00:27.633

00:27.667 --> 00:29.900
DIDN'T YOU JUST WEAR
THAT JACKET YESTERDAY ?

00:29.933 --> 00:32.233
YEAH, I'M WEARING
THE EXACT SAME OUTFIT.

00:32.267 --> 00:34.467
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
GOING THROUGH THAT

00:34.500 --> 00:38.067
WHOLE DECISION PROCESS
OF PICKING OUT AN OUTFIT.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.367
WELL, IT'S AWFUL.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.833
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK
IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF IT.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.300
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

00:43.333 --> 00:44.367
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH IT ?

00:44.400 --> 00:45.733
EVERYTHING.

00:45.767 --> 00:47.200
LOOK AT IT,
IT'S...

00:47.233 --> 00:48.867
MAROON.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.500
MAROON, YEAH.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.667
YOU THINK THAT'S
A GOOD LOOK ?

00:52.700 --> 00:54.667
UH, I THINK IT'S
A GOOD COLOR FOR ME, YEAH.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.400
UM, HMM,
WELL, IT'S NOT.

00:56.433 --> 00:57.933
SO, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE IT OFF

00:57.967 --> 01:00.067
BECAUSE I'M GETTING
SOME CLOTHES TOGETHER

01:00.067 --> 01:02.733
FOR THAT HOMELESS GUY THAT
HANGS OUT BY THE GAS STATION.

01:02.767 --> 01:06.367
HEY, I'VE HAD THIS JACKET SINCE
I STARTED DOING "SEINFELD".

01:06.400 --> 01:07.967

01:12.333 --> 01:14.867
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
TIME TO UPDATE...

01:14.900 --> 01:17.700
YOUR WARDROBE A LITTLE,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

01:17.733 --> 01:19.067
GET THE HELL

01:19.067 --> 01:20.967
LISTEN, LISTEN...

01:44.700 --> 01:47.267

01:50.133 --> 01:53.767
SO, I'M NOT GOING TO
BE AROUND THIS WEEKEND

01:57.267 --> 01:58.267

OH, THAT'S NICE.

01:59.433 --> 02:02.067

YEAH, TO A JEW.

02:04.933 --> 02:06.200
MARRYING A JEW.

02:06.233 --> 02:07.300

02:07.333 --> 02:09.167
SO, AM I, THEY MAKE
THE BEST HUSBANDS.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.600
AND HE'S CONVERTING.

02:10.633 --> 02:13.500
HE'S GETTING BAPTIZED
AND THE WHOLE THING, WHATEVER.

02:13.533 --> 02:14.767
REALLY ?

02:14.800 --> 02:15.767
WOW.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.167
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

02:18.200 --> 02:20.533
I'LL LEAVE YOU THE NUMBER
WHERE I'M GOING TO BE STAYING

02:20.567 --> 02:22.533
JUST IN CASE ANYTHING
COMES UP.

02:22.567 --> 02:24.867
OKAY.

02:24.900 --> 02:28.967
I CAME UP HERE FOR THE PAPER,
THANK YOU, BUT I...

02:29.067 --> 02:31.533
OH GOD, I HATE DOING THIS,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

02:31.567 --> 02:33.367
YOU ALWAYS TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.133
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING
THE WRONG WAY EVER SINCE
I'VE KNOWN YOU.

02:36.167 --> 02:39.967
SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS IN PARIS
AND I REMEMBER IT EXACTLY...

02:40.067 --> 02:41.367
FORGET PARIS !

02:41.400 --> 02:45.133
ALRIGHT, YOU STOLE MY OUTGOING
MESSAGE ON MY ANSWERING MACHINE.

02:45.167 --> 02:46.133
WHAT,
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.800
WHAT,
ARE YOU NUTS ?

02:47.833 --> 02:49.767
I KNOW YOU'RE ETHICAL,
I'M ETHICAL.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.133
WHEN PEOPLE STEAL JOKES,
WE FUCKING HATE THAT.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.933
BUT I HATE WHEN PEOPLE FUCKING
STEAL MY OUTGOING MESSAGES.

02:53.967 --> 02:56.800
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:56.833 --> 02:59.333
YOU HAVE MY SAME
ANSWERING MACHINE
OUTGOING MESSAGE,

02:59.367 --> 03:00.700
AND IT BUGS ME.

03:00.733 --> 03:01.700
THAT'S MY MESSAGE !

03:01.733 --> 03:03.167
I WROTE IT
IN PARIS !

03:03.200 --> 03:06.200
YOU WROTE IT IN PARIS, I HAD
THAT MESSAGE SEVEN YEARS AGO.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.600
BULLSHIT !

03:07.633 --> 03:10.133
I WROTE IT SEVEN
AND A HALF YEARS AGO !

03:10.167 --> 03:12.067
WHO'S WORD ARE YOU
GOING TO TRUST, OKAY ?

03:12.067 --> 03:15.300
AN EX-ALCOHOLICS OR A PERSON
WHO WAS LUCID 24 HOURS A DAY

03:15.333 --> 03:16.700
HIS WHOLE LIFE ?

03:16.733 --> 03:17.733
DO ME A FAVOR ?

03:17.767 --> 03:18.733
WHAT ?

03:18.767 --> 03:19.767
PLEASE CHANGE IT.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.767
WHAT ?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.400
'CAUSE IT'S REALLY
BOTHERING ME.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.100
I WANT YOU TO CHANGE THAT
BECAUSE PEOPLE CALL ME

03:24.133 --> 03:25.233
AND THEY CALL YOU
AND THEY GO,

03:25.267 --> 03:27.600
"WELL, LARRY DAVID
HAS THE SAME THING."

03:27.633 --> 03:29.367
IT'S NOT FUCKING
LARRY DAVID'S, IT'S MINE.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.467
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE A WIFE,
I DON'T HAVE, YOU KNOW...

03:32.500 --> 03:34.567
MY PARENTS ARE DEAD,
YOU HAVE A FAMILY.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.200
COME ON, CHANGE,
CAN YOU, COME ON.

03:37.233 --> 03:40.433
OH, HE DOESN'T HAVE A WIFE
AND HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD.

03:40.467 --> 03:41.567
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.667
I NEED, I HOLD
ONTO THESE THINGS.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.300
DOESN'T HAVE A WIFE
AND HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.467
OH.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.633
DO ME A FAVOR
AND CHANGE IT FOR ME.

03:47.667 --> 03:50.167
YEAH, I'LL CHANGE IT
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A WIFE

03:50.200 --> 03:52.600
AND YOUR PARENTS,
YOU LOST YOUR PARENTS.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.267
I'M LAUGHING, YOU KNOW WHY,
'CAUSE YOU'RE FUNNY.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.933
AND THEY WOULD'VE BEEN 95,
BUT THEY'RE DEAD.

03:56.967 --> 03:58.400
I'M LAUGHING--

03:58.433 --> 04:00.533
IT'S A SHAME.

04:00.567 --> 04:01.833
ARE YOU DONE ?

04:01.867 --> 04:04.067
I DIDN'T STEAL
YOUR MESSAGE, ASSHOLE.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.067
I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.600
YOU TOOK IT FROM ME,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,

04:06.633 --> 04:07.667
I'LL BE THE MAN.

04:07.700 --> 04:08.833
I'LL BE THE MAN.

04:08.867 --> 04:09.900
WHATEVER.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.600
I'LL BE THE MAN.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.233
RIDICULOUS.

04:21.567 --> 04:25.267
HI, UH, WE'RE NOT IN, PLEASE
LEAVE A MESSAGE AT THE TONE,

04:25.300 --> 04:26.800
THANK YOU.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.933
FANTASTIC.

04:28.967 --> 04:31.067
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT ?

04:31.067 --> 04:33.867
WHAT'S WRONG,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.833
AT LEAST IT'S
AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.

04:35.867 --> 04:37.733
IT'S NOT AN ADMISSION
OF GUILT.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.467
HOW'S THAT AN ADMISSION
OF GUILT ?

04:39.500 --> 04:41.133
I WAS THE MAN, IT'S NOT
AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.

04:41.167 --> 04:44.900
I'M A BIG MAN,
I'M A BIG EXPANSIVE MAN.

04:44.933 --> 04:48.167
YOU'RE A SMALL PETTY,
YOU'RE A SMALL PETTY MAN.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.967
DON'T CHANGE THAT.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.167
I REMEMBER WHEN
YOU MADE THAT MESSAGE.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.533
I THOUGHT IT
WAS VERY FUNNY.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.567
OH, SO THEN TO SHOW THAT,
YOU KNOW, I WAS THE MAN,

04:58.600 --> 05:00.867
I CHANGED THE MESSAGE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF HIM IN THE OFFICE.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.633
FROM THE OFFICE ?

05:02.667 --> 05:03.867
YEAH.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.133
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD
CHANGE YOUR OUTGOING MESSAGE.

05:06.167 --> 05:07.800
YEAH, IT WAS EASY.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.067
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
TO BE HERE.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.067
NO, SO, WHAT DO
I GOT TO TAKE ?

05:10.067 --> 05:11.700
DO I NEED
A TRAVELING OUTFIT ?

05:11.733 --> 05:13.833
UH, YES, YOU NEED
A TRAVELING OUTFIT,

05:13.867 --> 05:15.733
YOU NEED SOMETHING
FOR THE BAPTISM,

05:15.767 --> 05:17.467
SO, WE'RE PROBABLY--

05:17.500 --> 05:19.633
WHAT IS
A BAPTISM ANYWAY ?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.633
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT A BAPTISM IS ?

05:21.667 --> 05:23.867
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS,
SOMETHING TO DO WITH WATER ?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.733
YEAH, YEAH.

05:25.767 --> 05:28.133
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT A BAPTISM IS.

05:28.167 --> 05:29.667
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.467
WELL, YOU'LL FIND OUT
TOMORROW, FIRST HAND.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.933
YOU'RE GOING TO WITNESS
THE WHOLE THING.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.400
WHAT DOES THE AVERAGE
GENTILE WEAR TO A BAPTISM ?

05:36.433 --> 05:37.867
( laughing )

05:37.900 --> 05:39.533
SOMETHING, UH...

05:39.567 --> 05:41.533
BLUE BLAZER AND A RED TIE
AND A WHITE SHIRT ?

05:41.567 --> 05:42.867
YEAH, DO YOU HAVE THAT ?

05:42.900 --> 05:44.667
MY ST. ANTHONY'S--

05:44.700 --> 05:47.233
KHAKIS AND A BLUE BLAZER
WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

05:47.267 --> 05:48.600
AND THEN A WEDDING,
SOMETHING FOR THE WEDDING ?

05:48.633 --> 05:50.233
THEN SOMETHING
FOR THE WEDDING.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.233
YES.
THEN THE NEXT DAY.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.100
BOY, THIS IS ROUGH.

05:53.133 --> 05:55.567
THIS GUY'S CONVERTING.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.500
WHY IS HE
DOING THAT ?

05:57.533 --> 05:59.900
YOU GUYS COME TO OUR SIDE,
WE DON'T GO TO YOUR SIDE.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.467
YEAH.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.900
JEWS DON'T CONVERT,
I'M REALLY SURPRISED.

06:03.933 --> 06:05.700
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF HE DIDN'T CONVERT,

06:05.733 --> 06:06.700
SHE WOULDN'T
MARRY HIM.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.500
I KNOW THAT ABOUT BECKY,

06:09.533 --> 06:12.067
SHE'S VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT HER RELIGION.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.367
WHY DO CHRISTIANS TAKE
EVERYTHING SO PERSONALLY

06:14.400 --> 06:16.200
WITH CHRIST, YOU KNOW ?

06:16.233 --> 06:18.833
IT'S LIKE, IT'S NOT ONLY
DO YOU HAVE TO WORSHIP HIM,

06:18.867 --> 06:20.533
YOU WANT EVERYBODY TO.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.267
IT'S LIKE,
I LIKE LOBSTER.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.333
DO I GO AROUND PUSHING
LOBSTER ON PEOPLE ?

06:24.367 --> 06:26.633
DO I SAY, YOU MUST
LIKE LOBSTERS, EAT LOBSTER,

06:26.667 --> 06:28.267
IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.167
IT'S NOT ONLY
WHERE YOU LIVE.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.733
YOU GO TO AFRICA, YOU TRAVEL
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

06:32.767 --> 06:35.967
GET, EAT LOBSTER, HAVE SOME
MORE LOBSTER, IT'S GOOD.

06:36.067 --> 06:37.333
I DON'T REALLY
THINK IT'S...

06:37.367 --> 06:39.067
WE WANT YOU
TO HAVE LOBSTER !

06:39.067 --> 06:40.400
LOBSTER AND RELIGION,

06:40.433 --> 06:43.133
I REALLY DON'T SEE
THE SIMILARITIES.

06:43.167 --> 06:46.133
HEY, WHAT TIME IS THE CAR
PICKING US UP IN THE MORNING ?

06:46.167 --> 06:47.767
UH, I'M GOING TO DRIVE.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.200
NO, LET'S JUST
TAKE A--

06:50.233 --> 06:51.800
NO, I DON'T WANT TO
TAKE THAT CAR SERVICE,

06:51.833 --> 06:53.433
THEY NEVER SHOW UP
AND THEY'RE NOT DEPENDABLE.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.533
BUT THEN WE HAVE TO
FIND A PARKING SPACE

06:55.567 --> 06:57.367
WHEN WE GET THERE
AT THE AIRPORT.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.800
WE'LL LEAVE EARLY,
THAT'S OKAY.

06:58.833 --> 07:01.067
LOOK AT ALL THIS.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.400
THAT'S TOO
MUCH STUFF.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.100
( Cheryl )
COME ON, HONEY,
LET'S GET GOING !

07:10.067 --> 07:12.467
I CAN'T FIND
THE TICKETS.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.800
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD THEM ?

07:23.233 --> 07:24.267
MY OFFICE.

07:26.567 --> 07:28.300
I LEFT THEM
IN THE OFFICE.

07:28.333 --> 07:29.333
OH.

07:29.367 --> 07:30.833
SHIT.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.667
THAT'S OKAY,
WE GOT TIME.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.933
THAT'S OKAY.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.400
IT'S ALRIGHT, WE HAVE TIME,
WE GOT UP EARLY ENOUGH.

08:10.567 --> 08:13.933
THEY'RE NOT THERE
AND I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

08:13.967 --> 08:16.233
YESTERDAY WHEN
I PRESSED THE SECURITY CODE

08:16.267 --> 08:19.400
TO GET INTO MY OFFICE,
THERE WAS THIS CREEPY GUY

08:19.433 --> 08:21.900
AND HE WAS,
HE WAS WATCHING ME

08:21.933 --> 08:23.633
AND HE SAW ME
PRESS EVERY NUMBER

08:23.667 --> 08:25.700
AND I'LL BET YOU HE GOT
INTO THAT OFFICE.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.167
I KNEW IT, HE WAS
STANDING OUT THERE

08:27.200 --> 08:29.067
AND I KNEW SOMETHING LIKE
THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.167
SO, SOMEBODY CAME
INTO YOUR OFFICE

08:30.200 --> 08:32.067
AND STOLE AIRLINE
TICKETS TO MONTEREY ?

08:32.067 --> 08:33.367
THAT GUY,
THERE WAS SOMETHING,

08:33.400 --> 08:34.700
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE
SAID SOMETHING--

08:34.733 --> 08:36.933
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
STEAL TICKETS TO MONTEREY ?

08:36.967 --> 08:39.667
WHY NOT ? MONTEREY'S
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.267
WAS ANYTHING
ELSE STOLEN ?

08:41.300 --> 08:42.400
WAS ANYTHING
ELSE GONE ?

08:42.433 --> 08:44.233
I DON'T KNOW,
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

08:44.267 --> 08:45.567
YOU KNOW, ALL OUR
INFORMATION IS ON THERE,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.100
OUR ADDRESS,
OUR PHONE NUMBER.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.733
HE'S NOT GONNA
BREAK INTO OUR HOUSE,

08:48.767 --> 08:50.067
HE'S GOING
TO MONTEREY.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.267
OKAY, THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.733
I'M GONNA CALL THE AIRLINE
AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.967
HE CAN'T JUST GET ON THE PLANE
WITH OUR TICKETS, CAN HE ?

08:56.067 --> 08:57.433
WHY CAN'T HE ?

08:57.467 --> 08:59.367
HE JUST HANDS THEM THE TICKET,
HE WALKS ON THE PLANE.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.467
CALL THE AIRLINE.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.267
I DON'T THINK
IT WORKS LIKE THAT.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.633
ALRIGHT, JUST TELL
THEM WHAT'S GOING ON.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.700
OKAY.

09:06.733 --> 09:08.767
HI, YES, AIRWEST ?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.367
THANK YOU.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.700

09:14.733 --> 09:17.267
HI, MY NAME IS CHERYL DAVID

09:19.967 --> 09:21.700
I'M ON HOLD.

09:31.233 --> 09:33.133
WELL, WHAT ?

09:33.167 --> 09:36.100
I'M STILL ON HOLD, LARRY,
HOW ARE WE DOING ON TIME ?

09:36.133 --> 09:38.167
I DON'T KNOW.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.967
WE'LL MAKE IT,
I THINK.

09:41.433 --> 09:43.600
OH, HI, YES,

09:43.633 --> 09:46.633
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO THE AIRPORT RIGHT NOW,

09:46.667 --> 09:49.067
OUR TICKETS HAVE
BEEN STOLEN...

09:49.067 --> 09:51.233
( together )
SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET ON
THE PLANE WITH OUR TICKETS...

09:51.267 --> 09:53.600
NO, NO, NO, NO--

09:54.967 --> 09:57.700
THEY JUST
PUT ME ON HOLD.

09:57.733 --> 10:00.000
THEY'RE GONNA
GET A SUPERVISOR.

10:01.567 --> 10:04.133
LOOK AT THIS,
LOOK AT THIS.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.000
SHOULD I GO
TO LINCOLN ?

10:08.033 --> 10:11.167
I NEED LINCOLN APPROVAL, I JUST
CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN, TELL ME.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.867
THEN GO LINCOLN !

10:15.400 --> 10:17.100
( Cheryl )
OH, THERE'S THE LOT.

10:21.467 --> 10:22.567
HI.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.967
OKAY, LET ME JUST--

10:25.000 --> 10:28.233
NO, NO, BECAUSE
I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO YOU.

10:28.267 --> 10:30.633
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING,
I CAN'T, YOU, YOU,

10:30.667 --> 10:32.933
YOU CANNOT HELP ME,
I, NO, I NEED A--

10:32.967 --> 10:33.967
OH, JUST FORGET IT.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.233
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST FORGET IT,

10:36.267 --> 10:38.833
WE'RE ALREADY HERE
AT THE AIRPORT.

10:38.867 --> 10:40.533
THERE'S NO SPACES.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.133
WELL, HMM.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.933
THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:46.967 --> 10:50.300
YEAH, PARKING IS HARD
TO FIND AT THE AIRPORT.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.167
THAT'S SOMETHING NEW,
LARRY.

10:55.133 --> 11:00.067
WELL, MAYBE IN RETROSPECT
WE SHOULD'VE TAKEN
THE CAR SERVICE.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.600
OH, MY GOD.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.633
LARRY, WE'VE BEEN
DOWN THIS AISLE.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.267
WHAT'S THIS
GUY DOING ?

11:05.300 --> 11:06.933
WHAT'S THIS GUY ?

11:06.967 --> 11:07.933
YEAH.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.300
EXCUSE ME,

11:12.333 --> 11:13.667
YEAH, HE'S LEAVING.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.900
YEAH.

11:14.933 --> 11:16.767
BEAUTIFUL.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.433
SO, I GUESS WE'LL
JUST RUN TO THE GATE

11:21.467 --> 11:24.967
AND MAYBE
HE'S ALREADY IN OUR SEAT.

11:26.100 --> 11:28.167
I WONDER IF
HE BROUGHT A DATE.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.567
WHAT'S TAKING
THIS GUY SO LONG ?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.567
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING ?

11:35.600 --> 11:36.867
NOTHING.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.167
( honking )

11:42.933 --> 11:45.333
YEAH, IT'S ALRIGHT,
TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:45.367 --> 11:47.167
TAKE YOUR TIME,
NOBODY IS WAITING FOR YOU.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.867
MAKE A CALL,
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.700
I MEAN, HAVE
A NICE BAGEL.

11:51.733 --> 11:53.900
TAKE A LITTLE NAP.

11:53.933 --> 11:56.233
THAT'S FINE.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.633
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE ?

11:58.667 --> 12:02.333
TRADE PLACES,
YOU CAN DO IT OVER HERE.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.500
I'M TRYING TO GET
CATCH A PLANE, SIR.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.733
WELL, GET HERE EARLIER,
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.500
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

12:08.533 --> 12:09.600
HEY, SHE'S LEAVING.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.867
OH, GOOD, OKAY.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.200
HEY, MISTER !

12:29.633 --> 12:32.333
IF THE LOT'S FULL,
WHY DO THEY EVEN LET YOU GO IN ?

12:32.367 --> 12:34.633
THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN
GIVE YOU A TICKET.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.400
GOTTA DRIVE AROUND
LIKE AN IDIOT FOR 15 MINUTES ?

12:37.433 --> 12:40.067
OH, GOD,
LOOK AT THAT LINE.

12:41.267 --> 12:43.200
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO ?

12:43.233 --> 12:44.833
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO STAND IN LINE.

12:44.867 --> 12:46.500
WE JUST CAN'T
CUT RIGHT IN FRONT.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.867
THIS IS AN EXCEPTION,

12:47.900 --> 12:49.867
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO JUST GO
TO THE FRONT AND TELL HER.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.067
GO TO THE FRONT ?

12:51.067 --> 12:53.167
WE'LL JUST EXPLAIN
THE SITUATION.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.733
WE DON'T HAVE TIME,
LARRY, COME ON.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.767
HI.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.867

EXCUSE ME,
WE'RE IN LINE.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.167
SOMEBODY TOOK
OUR TICKETS--

13:01.200 --> 13:03.467
WE LOST OUR TICKETS.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.867
I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU
IF YOU JUST STEP
TO THE BACK OF THE LINE.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.700
WE REALLY DON'T
HAVE TIME.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.667
I WAS ACTUALLY
ON THE PHONE--

13:09.700 --> 13:10.933
I UNDERSTAND THAT, MA'AM,
BUT YOU NEED TO GET

13:10.967 --> 13:12.200

THE LINE, PLEASE.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.433
EVERYBODY HERE HAS
BEEN WAITING, OKAY ?

13:14.467 --> 13:16.167
I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU

13:16.200 --> 13:17.167
THANK YOU.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.500

FILLED UP ?

13:18.533 --> 13:21.633
SIR, PLEASE GET TO THE BACK OF
THE LINE RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU.

13:21.667 --> 13:22.967
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.233
ALRIGHT,
WHERE WERE WE ?

13:24.267 --> 13:25.867
YOU'RE ALL SET.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.400

BECAUSE IT'S A SHORT TRIP...

13:54.233 --> 13:55.967
I GOT THE GUY.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.067
THAT'S THE GUY.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.067

14:09.533 --> 14:12.467
OKAY, YOU CAN GIVE ME

14:12.500 --> 14:13.833
I WANT THE TICKET.

14:13.867 --> 14:16.067
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.067
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TICKET

14:18.100 --> 14:19.700

14:21.833 --> 14:23.867
I WANT THE TICKET
I GOTTA GET ON THE PLANE,
I GOT A WEDDING.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.367
I THINK YOU GOT ME CONFUSED
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.733
NO, I DON'T
THINK I DO.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.733
I DON'T HAVE
YOUR TICKET, OKAY ?

14:28.767 --> 14:29.933
I HAVE MY OWN TICKET.

14:29.967 --> 14:31.067
OF COURSE
YOU DO, YEAH.

14:31.067 --> 14:33.600
IT'S A BEREAVEMENT THING,
MY MOTHER'S DEATH.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.533
YEAH, RIGHT,
OKAY, YEAH.

14:35.567 --> 14:38.067
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
A LOOK AT IT, OKAY ?

14:38.100 --> 14:39.933
YEAH, IT'S YOUR

14:39.967 --> 14:41.567
YOU WANT TO SEE

14:41.600 --> 14:43.067

LET'S TAKE A LOOK, ALRIGHT ?

14:44.333 --> 14:45.367

14:47.300 --> 14:49.333

NO, IT'S MINE.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.800
CHRIS DARGA.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.167
SEE, IF THIS
WERE YOURS,

14:52.200 --> 14:55.267
IT WOULD SAY
"FUCKING DOUCHEBAG".

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
ASSHOLE.

14:58.233 --> 15:00.733
SORRY ABOUT

16:17.700 --> 16:19.367

DID YOU SEE ANYTHING ?

16:19.400 --> 16:21.733

SO, YOU HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME

16:41.233 --> 16:42.667

16:42.700 --> 16:45.567
SO, JUST TAKE IT EASY

16:45.600 --> 16:46.933
THANKS.

16:46.967 --> 16:48.067
HI.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.133
HI.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.733
WE LOST OUR TICKETS,

16:50.767 --> 16:52.967
WE NEED TO GET
ON THIS FLIGHT RIGHT NOW.

16:53.067 --> 16:55.367
SOMEBODY STOLE OUR TICKETS,
THEY'RE ON THE PLANE.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.700
I DON'T HAVE
A SINGLE TICKET,

16:56.733 --> 16:58.667
I'M COMPLETELY SOLD OUT,
I'M SORRY.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.067
( Cheryl )
WE ALREADY
HAVE TICKETS.

17:00.067 --> 17:01.067
THE POINT IS,
THE POINT IS

17:01.067 --> 17:02.133
SOMEBODY IS
IN OUR SEATS, SEE ?

17:02.167 --> 17:03.333
I DON'T
THINK THAT'S--

17:03.367 --> 17:04.367
NO, THAT'S
VERY POSSIBLE--

17:04.400 --> 17:05.367
( doors closing )

17:05.400 --> 17:07.067
ACTUALLY THE DOORS CLOSED
THAT MEANS--

17:07.067 --> 17:09.333
I ACTUALLY AM NOT LEGALLY
ALLOWED TO GO BACK ON THE PLANE.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.833
WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN
GET YOU ON ANOTHER FLIGHT--

17:10.867 --> 17:12.700
SOMEBODY'S SITTING
IN OUR SEATS ON THE PLANE.

17:12.733 --> 17:14.367
WE HAVE TICKETS
FOR THAT FLIGHT.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.933
CAN I SEE
THE TICKETS, PLEASE ?

17:16.967 --> 17:20.167
THEY WERE STOLEN.
WE DON'T HAVE THEM...

17:20.200 --> 17:23.900
OKAY, I CAN'T GO ON THE PLANE,
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

17:23.933 --> 17:24.967
BUT WHAT I CAN DO
FOR YOU FOLKS

17:25.067 --> 17:26.533
IS I CAN GET YOU
ON THE NEXT FLIGHT

17:26.567 --> 17:28.300
WHICH WILL ACTUALLY
GET YOU IN AT 4:00.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.467
THAT WOULD NOT
BE GOOD, ACTUALLY.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.333
WE WOULD MISS THE BAPTISM,
WE WOULD MISS--

17:32.367 --> 17:33.433
OH, I'M SORRY.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.167
YEAH, WE'RE TRYING
TO GO TO A WEDDING

17:35.200 --> 17:38.100
AND WE NEED TO BE THERE
IN A FEW HOURS--

17:38.133 --> 17:40.667
OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA,
I THINK I CAN ACTUALLY--

17:40.700 --> 17:41.733
OKAY, MAYBE
I THINK THIS WILL WORK.

17:41.767 --> 17:42.867
I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER
FLIGHT TO MONTEREY,

17:42.900 --> 17:44.867
BUT I CAN SEND YOU IN
THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO,

17:44.900 --> 17:47.100
10:30, WOULD GET YOU
INTO SAN FRANCISCO,

17:47.133 --> 17:49.300
UM, IT'S ONLY
AN HOUR FLIGHT,

17:49.333 --> 17:50.567
YOU COULD RENT A CAR
AND JUST DRIVE TO MONTEREY,

17:50.600 --> 17:51.600
IT'S ABOUT 100 MILES.

17:51.633 --> 17:53.067
THAT'D GET YOU
BY ABOUT 2:00

17:53.100 --> 17:54.333
AND THAT SHOULD
WORK FOR YOU.

17:54.367 --> 17:57.367
AND THEN AT LEAST
WE WOULDN'T MISS THE BAPTISM.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.867
THAT'S FINE,
WE'LL DO THAT.

17:58.900 --> 17:59.900
I'LL SET THAT UP FOR YOU,
I JUST NEED A CREDIT CARD

18:00.067 --> 18:01.700
AND I'LL GET THIS
ALL ROLLING FOR YOU.

18:01.733 --> 18:04.600
LARRY, GIVE HER
YOUR CREDIT CARD.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.433
HEY, YOU GOT
THE CELL PHONE ?

18:12.667 --> 18:14.767
I WANT TO CALL
RICHARD LEWIS,

18:14.800 --> 18:17.500
I WANT YOU TO
CORROBORATE THIS MESSAGE.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.067
THAT IS SO
RIDICULOUS.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.400
WHY, WHY IS
IT RIDICULOUS ?

18:23.133 --> 18:27.367
HA HA, THAT IS SUCH
A FUNNY MESSAGE,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.467
HOW DID YOU EVER COME UP
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

18:29.500 --> 18:31.633
YOU ARE SO CLEVER.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.400
HEY, I'M SITTING HERE
WITH MY WIFE

18:33.433 --> 18:37.233
AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE CAN SHED
SOME LIGHT ON THIS CONTROVERSY.

18:37.267 --> 18:39.067
SO, JUST HOLD ON.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.667
NO, I DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.233
COME ON, CHERYL.
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

18:42.267 --> 18:43.367
I DON'T WANT
TO DO IT, LARRY.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.567
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
DOING THAT RIGHT NOW.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.500
UM, SHE'LL TALK
TO YOU IN PERSON.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.967
SHE WANTS TO
DISCUSS THIS IN PERSON.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.067
OKAY.

18:59.233 --> 19:01.067
( p.a. system )
Flight 627 to San Francisco...

19:01.067 --> 19:02.500
THANK YOU.

19:02.533 --> 19:04.400
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.767
( female )
ALL SET.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.100
UM, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO GET TO MONTEREY ?

19:18.133 --> 19:19.667
ABOUT TWO HOURS.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.200
WE CAN STILL
MAKE IT.

19:21.233 --> 19:24.300
ALRIGHT, I'M GONNA DRIVE,
I'M GONNA DRIVE, THANK YOU.

19:26.067 --> 19:29.067
( Larry )
JESUS CHRIST,
SLOW DOWN.

19:30.433 --> 19:36.600
* BA, BA, BA,
YA, YA... *

19:36.633 --> 19:43.733
* AH, LA,
BA, BA, BA... *

19:43.767 --> 19:46.267
I'M GONNA
CHECK THE MACHINE.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.400
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A FRESH GRAPE ?

19:52.433 --> 19:54.267
HUH ?

19:54.300 --> 19:59.100
I'VE HAD FRESH APPLES,
I'VE NEVER HAD A FRESH GRAPE.

19:59.133 --> 20:02.167
I'VE NEVER HAD A FRESH CHERRY,
NEVER HAD A FRESH PEAR,

20:02.200 --> 20:06.300
NEVER SEEN A PEAR,

20:06.333 --> 20:09.000
NEVER SAW A PEAR
OUTSIDE OF A FRUIT STAND.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.833
WHAT'S GOING ON,
THE MACHINE'S NOT
EVEN COMING ON.

20:10.867 --> 20:11.933
THERE'S NO MESSAGE.

20:11.967 --> 20:13.533
THE MESSAGE THAT YOU CHANGED
FROM YOUR OFFICE ?

20:13.567 --> 20:14.600
YEAH.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.400
YEAH, IT'S NOT
WORKING ?

20:16.433 --> 20:17.567
NO.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.367
DID YOU CHECK IT
AFTER YOU YOU CHANGED IT ?

20:20.400 --> 20:23.367
NO, I DIDN'T CHECK IT,
I THOUGHT I DID IT RIGHT.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.200
YEAH, YEAH.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.100
WELL, SO WHAT ?

20:29.133 --> 20:31.900
SO WE MISS
A COUPLE OF CALLS,
BIG DEAL.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.633
THIS IS NICE COUNTRY,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

20:40.667 --> 20:42.233
NICE COUNTRY
UP HERE.

20:42.267 --> 20:44.933
MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE UP HERE,
THINK WE SHOULD ?

20:44.967 --> 20:48.400
I THINK YOU SHOULD
LOOK AT THE MAP AND FIND OUT
WHERE WE ARE EXACTLY.

20:48.433 --> 20:52.233
SETTLE DOWN,
ARE WE SETTLED DOWN,
DO YOU THINK ?

20:52.267 --> 20:55.933
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO BE
TO BE SETTLED DOWN ?

20:55.967 --> 20:57.733
WE HAVE A HOUSE
AND CHAIRS.

20:57.767 --> 21:00.267
YOU KNOW,
GRAPE WORKS AS A SODA,

21:00.300 --> 21:01.300
SORT OF
AS A GUM,

21:01.333 --> 21:04.633
BUT I WONDER WHY
IT DOESN'T WORK AS A PIE.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.100
GRAPE PIE,
THERE'S NO GRAPE PIE.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.233
I DON'T KNOW,

21:09.267 --> 21:11.667
DID WE THINK WE REALLY
NEEDED ALASKA AND HAWAII ?

21:11.700 --> 21:13.800
THEY GOTTA
RUIN EVERYTHING.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.967
THEY RUINED THE CONTINENTAL
UNITED STATES,

21:16.067 --> 21:17.167
RUINED IT.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.567
WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL
PACIFIC COAST, ATLANTIC COAST,

21:20.600 --> 21:21.867
THAT'S THE
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.

21:21.900 --> 21:22.967
YOU DON'T NEED
MORE STATES.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.700
WE'RE NOT
THE BRITISH EMPIRE.

21:24.733 --> 21:28.333
THEY TRYIN' TO TURN US
INTO THE BRITISH EMPIRE ?

21:28.367 --> 21:30.200
AND WHAT IS
PUERTO RICO ANYWAY ?

21:30.233 --> 21:34.133
( Cheryl )
OKAY, PLEASE,
I AM TRYING TO DRIVE.

21:36.333 --> 21:39.833
OKAY, THAT'S 3/10ths
OF A MILE, RIGHT THERE.

21:39.867 --> 21:41.067
YEAH ?

21:41.100 --> 21:42.733
SO...
I DON'T KNOW.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.233
IT'S GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE, RIGHT ?

21:44.267 --> 21:45.933
IS THAT A... ?

21:45.967 --> 21:48.100
I WILL BE SO MAD...

21:48.133 --> 21:49.400
IF WE MISS THIS.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.400
THIS IS
A ROW OF PINES.

21:51.433 --> 21:53.100
WE ALREADY
PASSED PINES.

21:53.133 --> 21:54.167
AND THAT LOOKS LIKE A CAR,
IS THAT A CAR ?

21:54.200 --> 21:56.067
HEY, IS THAT
A CAR UP THERE ?

21:56.067 --> 21:57.400
STUPID DIRECTIONS.

21:57.433 --> 21:59.400
LET'S JUST STOP
AND GET OUT AND TAKE A LOOK,

21:59.433 --> 22:00.700
IT'S GOTTA
BE HERE.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.200
I DON'T KNOW.

22:23.700 --> 22:27.367
STOP, STOP !

22:27.400 --> 22:29.267
( Cheryl )
NO, LARRY !

22:29.300 --> 22:31.133
NO !

22:31.167 --> 22:32.167
( female )
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
NO !

22:32.200 --> 22:36.067
JESUS, GET HIM,
HE CAN'T SWIM !

22:36.067 --> 22:40.167
GET HIM !
HOLD YOUR BREATH !

22:40.200 --> 22:43.733
OH, GOD !

22:48.133 --> 22:50.200
HOLD ON !

22:58.633 --> 23:00.867
HOW YOU DOING ?

23:08.133 --> 23:12.167
ANYBODY NEED A CHANGE
OF DRY CLOTHES ?

23:12.700 --> 23:14.867
HOT BATH ?

23:14.900 --> 23:16.967
YOU HAPPY
ABOUT THIS, LARRY ?

23:17.067 --> 23:18.067
IS THIS WHAT
YOU HAD IN MIND ?

23:18.100 --> 23:19.467
YOU LIKE THIS,
YOU DICK ?

23:19.500 --> 23:20.667
HONEY,
IT'S FINE.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.067
IT'S NOT FINE, WHAT THE HELL
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ?

23:23.067 --> 23:26.200
I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
DROWNING HIM, OKAY ?
I'M SORRY !

23:26.233 --> 23:27.700
BULLSHIT, YOU DIDN'T
THINK HE WAS DROWNING,

23:27.733 --> 23:29.133
YOU JUST DIDN'T
WANT HIM TO CONVERT.

23:29.167 --> 23:31.300
SO YOU CAME SCREAMING
DOWN THE HILL TO STOP IT.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.067
WHAT DO I CARE ?
I DON'T CARE IF HE CONVERTS.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.600
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

23:34.633 --> 23:36.600
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
LOSE A JEW AND YOU KNOW IT.

23:36.633 --> 23:37.633
I DON'T CARE
IF I LOSE JEWS.

23:37.667 --> 23:38.667
TAKE THEM ALL,
I DON'T NEED THEM.

23:38.700 --> 23:39.700
I DON'T WANT THEM.

23:39.733 --> 23:41.067
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE BAPTISM,

23:41.100 --> 23:42.133
BUT YOU CAME
AND BLEW IT.

23:42.167 --> 23:43.900
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

23:43.933 --> 23:46.333
I WANT YOU, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO BE JEWISH.

23:46.367 --> 23:49.067
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

23:49.067 --> 23:51.567
I NEVER SAW A BAPTISM BEFORE,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.533
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW
WHAT A BAPTISM IS ?

23:53.567 --> 23:54.833
BECAUSE I'D
NEVER BEEN TO ONE.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.633
OKAY, WELL, I'VE NEVER BEEN TO,
YOU KNOW, A BRIS,

23:56.667 --> 23:57.700
BUT I KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

23:57.733 --> 24:00.067
LARRY, LARRY,

24:00.067 --> 24:01.533
LARRY...

24:01.567 --> 24:03.967
COME HERE.

24:04.067 --> 24:07.633
YOU DON'T KNOW ME,
DAVE LEVIN,

24:07.667 --> 24:08.933
I'M THE SCHMUCK'S
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

24:08.967 --> 24:10.867
LISTEN, WHAT YOU DID
IS A VERY GUTSY THING, OKAY ?

24:10.900 --> 24:12.967
I'M HERE TO SAY,

24:13.067 --> 24:15.367
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE A BOW FOR IT,
I'M JUST TELLING YOU.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.067
AS ONE JEW
TO ANOTHER,

24:17.067 --> 24:19.067
IT'S A GUTSY THING
TO COME IN AND STEP IN
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

24:19.067 --> 24:20.233
I DIDN'T EVEN--

24:20.267 --> 24:22.167
FOR MY FAMILY,
THANK YOU.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.867
YOU DID GOOD, EXCUSE ME,
YOU DID GOOD.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.967
BUT I DIDN'T EVEN,
I THOUGHT HE WAS...

24:28.067 --> 24:30.800
YOU'RE WITH US
NOW, OKAY ?

24:30.833 --> 24:33.333
YOU'RE WITH US
NOW, ALRIGHT ?

24:33.367 --> 24:35.367
WELL, THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT DO WE DO NOW ?

24:35.400 --> 24:36.467
WHEN DO WE
GO BACK IN ?

24:36.500 --> 24:37.500
RIGHT.

24:37.533 --> 24:38.533
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
GO BACK IN ?

24:38.567 --> 24:39.833
WE GOTTA
FINISH IT.

24:39.867 --> 24:41.067
FINISH IT ?
I DID IT.

24:41.067 --> 24:42.433
I DID WHAT I SAID
I WAS GONNA DO.

24:42.467 --> 24:44.833
I GOT UNDER THE WATER,
YOU HELD ME UNDER.

24:44.867 --> 24:45.867
NO, HONEY, YOU JUST
KIND OF STARTED IT,

24:45.900 --> 24:46.933
BUT IT DIDN'T
REALLY WORK.

24:46.967 --> 24:48.267
( male )
NOT COMPLETE.

24:48.300 --> 24:50.333
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT, I DID
WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

24:50.367 --> 24:51.800
BUT YOU GOTTA
GO BACK IN.

24:51.833 --> 24:52.933
I DUNKED YOU ONE TIME,

24:52.967 --> 24:54.800
YOU NEED TO BE DUNKED
THREE TIMES.

24:54.833 --> 24:56.400
YOU NEED
TWO MORE DUNKS.

24:56.433 --> 25:00.233
YOU'RE JOKING,
NO, NO, NO MORE DUNKING,

25:00.267 --> 25:01.533
I DON'T WANT
ANYMORE DUNKING.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.233
GET BACK IN THERE,
A COUPLE OF DUNKS, YOU'RE DONE.

25:03.267 --> 25:04.533
I DON'T WANT TO
GO BACK IN THERE,

25:04.567 --> 25:05.767
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH
THE FIRST TIME,

25:05.800 --> 25:07.233
I DON'T WANT TO
GO BACK IN THERE NOW.

25:07.267 --> 25:10.367
I LIKE THE WAY YOU TOLD THEM
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
A BAPTISM BEFORE.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.500
THAT WAS BRILLIANT,
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

25:13.533 --> 25:15.533
( female )
YOU'RE A GENIUS,
A GENIUS.

25:15.567 --> 25:17.500
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT

25:17.533 --> 25:19.200
SOMETHING HAD TO
BE DONE, REALLY.

25:19.233 --> 25:20.433
YOU DID IT.

25:20.467 --> 25:21.967
YOU DONE
DID IT, BOY.

25:22.067 --> 25:24.167
SO, I SAID THAT THING
ABOUT THE BAPTISM, AND...

25:24.200 --> 25:26.500
YEAH, RABBI AKEBA
SAYS IT TAKES ONE MAN.

25:26.533 --> 25:28.067
WE DON'T HAVE TO
DO IT IN A RIVER.

25:28.067 --> 25:29.533
DO YOU HAVE A TUB
IN THIS HOUSE ?

25:29.567 --> 25:31.900
WELL, YES, OF COURSE,
WE HAVE A TUB.

25:31.933 --> 25:32.933
WE CAN
FILL THE TUB UP.

25:32.967 --> 25:34.100
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

25:34.133 --> 25:35.867
GET ME A CUP OF WATER,
I'LL SPRINKLE YOU.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.667
JUST A CUP OF WATER.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.067
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ABOUT THE RIVER.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.533
I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD BE DOING THIS.

25:40.567 --> 25:41.567
WHAT ?

25:41.600 --> 25:42.867
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

25:42.900 --> 25:44.733
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE A BAPTISM,

25:44.767 --> 25:46.067
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL,

25:46.067 --> 25:47.233
BUT, I FELT SOMETHING.

25:47.267 --> 25:49.067
WHEN I WENT IN THAT WATER,
WHEN I WAS HELD UNDER THERE,

25:49.100 --> 25:50.700
I FELT SOME
SORT OF REVELATION,

25:50.733 --> 25:52.167
LIKE IT WAS SOME SORT OF
MESSAGE FROM GOD THAT...

25:52.200 --> 25:55.133
THAT I SHOULDN'T
DO THIS.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.100
AFTER I CAME OUT
OF THE WATER,

25:57.133 --> 25:59.667
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A CHRISTIAN,
I FELT LIKE EVEN MORE OF A JEW.

25:59.700 --> 26:00.833
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

26:00.867 --> 26:01.933
I'M JUST SAYING,

26:01.967 --> 26:04.100
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME
THERE THAT TOLD ME

26:04.133 --> 26:06.067
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
WAS SAYING,

26:06.100 --> 26:07.933
DON'T DO THIS,
BE HAPPY WITH WHO YOU ARE,

26:07.967 --> 26:09.433
YOU'RE JEWISH
AND THAT'S OKAY.

26:09.467 --> 26:12.200
WELL, I NEED FOR YOU
TO BE A CHRISTIAN
BEFORE I MARRY YOU.

26:12.233 --> 26:14.633
WHOEVER STEPS UP AND
DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

26:14.667 --> 26:15.833
I FEEL GOOD.

26:15.867 --> 26:16.900
YOU SHOULD,
YOU SHOULD.

26:16.933 --> 26:18.200
YOU'RE AMAZING.

26:18.233 --> 26:19.467
YOU'RE A HERO.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.100
THANK YOU.

26:21.133 --> 26:23.633
I'D LIKE YOU TALK
AT MY DAUGHTER'S BAT MITZVAH.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.133
SOMETHING CHANGED
MY MIND FOR ME,

26:25.167 --> 26:26.600
SOMETHING MAKES ME
FEEL DIFFERENT NOW.

26:26.633 --> 26:27.933
AND I THINK
IT WAS THE BAPTISM.

26:27.967 --> 26:29.267
FINE, THEN WE'RE
NOT GETTING MARRIED.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.433
I'M NOT
GETTING BAPTIZED.

26:30.467 --> 26:32.100
WELL, I'M NOT
GETTING MARRIED.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.700
( Cheryl )
OKAY, SHELDON, VICKY--

26:34.733 --> 26:36.733
HEY, LARRY,

26:36.767 --> 26:37.933

26:37.967 --> 26:39.700
YOU HAPPY NOW,
YOU SONOFABITCH ?!

26:39.733 --> 26:42.800
DON'T CALL HIM A SONOFABITCH,
HE'S NOT A SONOFABITCH.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.567
THIS MAN HAPPENED TO DO
A WONDERFUL THING TODAY.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.667
WHAT ?

26:45.700 --> 26:46.833
WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING,

26:46.867 --> 26:48.733
THAT BEING A CHRISTIAN
ISN'T A WONDERFUL THING ?

26:48.767 --> 26:49.800
WHAT ARE YOU
INSINUATING ?

26:49.833 --> 26:51.100
NO, HE'S NOT
SAYING THAT.

26:51.133 --> 26:53.067
IT'S WONDERFUL FOR YOU,
WE RESENT THE RECRUITMENT.

26:53.067 --> 26:55.300
WE DON'T NEED YOU !

26:55.333 --> 26:57.333
YOUR PEOPLE... !

26:57.367 --> 26:59.567

27:01.067 --> 27:04.267
EVERYTHING'S A PROBLEM

27:05.400 --> 27:17.467
( yelling all at once )

27:33.767 --> 27:36.133
AH, IT'S GOOD
TO BE HOME.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.667
HEY, THERE'S MY JACKET,

27:51.700 --> 27:53.700
THERE'S THE GUY

27:53.733 --> 27:55.867
HEY !

27:57.533 --> 27:59.467
REMEMBER ME ?

27:59.500 --> 28:00.633
OH, HI.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.400
THAT'S MY JACKET,
IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

28:03.433 --> 28:04.700
I'M GLAD YOU COULD
USE IT, THERE YOU GO.

28:04.733 --> 28:05.733
THANK YOU.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.800
THANKS AGAIN FOR--

28:06.833 --> 28:08.533
