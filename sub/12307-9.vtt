YEAH, ALBEIT TRUE,
THAT'S SOMETHING MY GUESTS

08:38.889 --> 08:40.150
ARE ALREADY
FULLY AWARE OF, TYLER.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.922
WHAT WE'RE SELLING HERE

08:41.922 --> 08:45.125
IS THE GRAYSON LIFESTYLE.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.927
AND IT SEEMS, ONCE AGAIN,

08:46.927 --> 08:49.199
DANIEL MAY HAVE A SLIGHT
BUILT-IN ADVANTAGE.

08:49.199 --> 08:50.861
WELL, TYLER'S BEEN LIVING

08:50.861 --> 08:52.002
THE GRAYSON LIFESTYLE
ALL SUMMER.

08:52.002 --> 08:53.133
I'D SAY HE GETS IT.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.036
(sighs)
AMBITION VERSUS NEPOTISM.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.167
GAME ON.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.069
GENTLEMEN.

08:59.069 --> 09:00.210
MRS. GRAYSON.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.042
PLEASE TAKE MY SEAT.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.044
THANK YOU, TYLER.
HELLO, DANIEL.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.115
MOTHER.

09:05.115 --> 09:06.877
(Conrad) IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE DONE HERE.

09:06.877 --> 09:08.879
SEE YOU BOYS
AT THE NEW INVESTOR PARTY.

09:08.879 --> 09:10.921
MAY THE BEST YOUNG MAN WIN.

09:10.921 --> 09:12.953
YOU BETTER WATCH YOURSELF.
 YEAH, YEAH.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.224
MM.

09:14.224 --> 09:15.956
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:15.956 --> 09:18.158
THE POLICE FOUND
FRANK'S CELL PHONE.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.930
IT WAS IN OUR GARDEN.

09:19.930 --> 09:22.262
THEY'RE BUILDING A CASE
AGAINST YOU, CONRAD.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.134
WELL, IT'S A CASE
THEY'RE GONNA LOSE, VICTORIA,

09:24.134 --> 09:25.966
BECAUSE THAT PHONE
HAD TO HAVE BEEN PLANTED.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.967
BY WHOM?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.168
WELL, BY THE SAME BASTARD

09:28.168 --> 09:30.200
WHO HID THE CAMERA
IN LYDIA'S APARTMENT.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.102
I STILL HAVE
A HARD TIME BELIEVING

09:32.102 --> 09:34.905
THAT YOU DIDN'T INSTALL
THAT CAMERA.

09:34.905 --> 09:36.977
WELL, I'M SO SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT YOU, MY DEAR,

09:36.977 --> 09:39.009
BUT I'M INNOCENT
ON ALL COUNTS.

09:39.009 --> 09:42.112
AND I SUGGEST YOU START
BACKING ME UP,

09:42.112 --> 09:44.114
BECAUSE IF I END UP
GETTING FRAMED FOR THIS,

09:44.114 --> 09:45.285
I'M GONNA SEE TO IT

09:45.285 --> 09:47.958
THAT EVERYTHING YOU CHERISH
SO DEARLY

09:47.958 --> 09:51.962
IS RIPPED FROM THOSE GREEDY
LITTLE CLAWS OF YOURS.

09:51.962 --> 09:53.163
CAREFUL, CONRAD.

09:53.163 --> 09:57.127
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW,
I DON'T RESPOND WELL TO THREATS.

10:02.132 --> 10:04.074
WHO'S THAT HOTTIE I SAW
HANGING OUT ON THE BOAT?

10:04.074 --> 10:06.106
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU HAD
A NEW PROSPECT ON THE RADAR.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.938
WHAT NEW PROSPECT?

10:07.938 --> 10:10.110
(sighs)
YOUR FRIEND KARA.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.313
I GUESS SHE DECIDED NOT TO
TAKE OFF LAST NIGHT AFTER ALL.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.085
WHAT'S HER STORY?

10:15.085 --> 10:16.146
LONG AND COMPLICATED.

10:16.146 --> 10:18.088
LOOK,
I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF

10:18.088 --> 10:19.950
LIKE I'M RUNNING A BLOCK
ON A BUDDY,

10:19.950 --> 10:22.953
BUT, UH, N-O, NO, JACK.

10:22.953 --> 10:24.955
WELL, YOU TOLD ME NEVER TO TAKE
DATING ADVICE FROM YOU, SO--

10:24.955 --> 10:26.256
AND THAT WAS LAST WEEK.

10:26.256 --> 10:27.998
LOOK, KARA'S WHAT YOU'D CALL
A NOMAD,

10:27.998 --> 10:31.031
DOESN'T STAY IN ONE PLACE
FOR TOO LONG, YOU KNOW?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.102
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
STAYING HALF NAKED

10:32.102 --> 10:34.104
ON JACK'S BOAT ALL MORNING.

10:34.104 --> 10:36.006

38:09.017 --> 38:10.489
WHENEVER.

38:13.462 --> 38:16.465
♪ YEAH, AND I WAS BREAKING
THROUGH THIS WALL ♪

38:16.465 --> 38:18.567
HOW ABOUT
WE START RIGHT NOW?

38:18.567 --> 38:21.570
♪♪♪

38:36.014 --> 38:38.016
THE CATERERS JUST LEFT.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.348
WILL THERE BE ANYTHING ELSE?

38:39.348 --> 38:41.490
NOTHING YOU CAN HELP ME WITH,
I'M AFRAID.

38:41.490 --> 38:43.051
GOOD NIGHT.

38:43.051 --> 38:45.524
WHY DID YOU HIRE ME?

38:45.524 --> 38:48.096
YOU'RE HAVING FAR FEWER PARTIES
THAN LAST YEAR,

38:48.096 --> 38:51.099
AND YOU'VE BASICALLY MADE ME
YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT.

38:51.099 --> 38:52.531
SO...

38:52.531 --> 38:54.563
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

38:57.105 --> 39:00.569
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

39:00.569 --> 39:04.473
I HIRED YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE BEST AT WHAT YOU DO...

39:04.473 --> 39:06.515
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE CLOSE
WITH EMILY.

39:06.515 --> 39:09.117
WELL, AS CLOSE AS ANYONE
CAN BE TO A PERSON LIKE HER.

39:09.117 --> 39:10.449
I SEE.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.581
WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT SHE
AND DANIEL MOVED IN TOGETHER

39:12.581 --> 39:14.583
SO QUICKLY?

39:14.583 --> 39:16.485
NO, NOT ENTIRELY.

39:16.485 --> 39:18.487
SHE KNOWS HOW TO GET
WHAT SHE WANTS.

39:18.487 --> 39:20.389
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

39:20.389 --> 39:23.432
JUST THAT SHE CAN BE...
TRICKY.

39:25.133 --> 39:27.135
LET'S YOU AND I
GO TO BRUNCH TOMORROW.

39:27.135 --> 39:28.597
AND WE CAN
DISCUSS THIS FURTHER.

39:28.597 --> 39:31.470
OKAY. I'LL MAKE US
A RESERVATION...

39:31.470 --> 39:33.402
VICTORIA.

39:33.402 --> 39:35.103
GOOD NIGHT.

39:36.144 --> 39:38.647
(knock on door)

39:44.613 --> 39:45.654
HI.

39:45.654 --> 39:47.155
HEY.

39:47.155 --> 39:49.558
I'M SORRY TO STOP BY
SO LATE.

39:49.558 --> 39:51.560
NO, IT'S FINE. IS--
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.592
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S...

39:53.592 --> 39:55.464
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

39:55.464 --> 39:56.565
(chuckles)

39:58.096 --> 39:59.568
UH...

39:59.568 --> 40:01.500
REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE GIRL

40:01.500 --> 40:04.102
WHO USED TO LIVE HERE BEFORE
WITH HER DAD?

40:04.102 --> 40:05.574
YEAH, OF COURSE.

40:05.574 --> 40:10.579
OKAY, WELL, THAT FRIEND
FROM NOLAN'S POOL...

40:10.579 --> 40:12.180
SHE'S THAT GIRL.

40:12.180 --> 40:14.182
ONLY SHE DOESN'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW ABOUT IT

40:14.182 --> 40:16.585
BECAUSE HER DAD WASN'T EXACTLY
POPULAR AROUND HERE,

40:16.585 --> 40:18.416
ESPECIALLY
WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS.

40:18.416 --> 40:22.521
BUT I TOLD HER--I TOLD HER
SHE CAN TRUST YOU.

40:22.521 --> 40:26.655
YOU MIND IF I SHOW HER
THE SWING THAT HER DAD BUILT?

40:26.655 --> 40:28.126
NO.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.198
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

40:30.198 --> 40:32.200
EMILY...

40:32.200 --> 40:33.602
THIS IS AMANDA,

40:33.602 --> 40:36.635
A VERY CLOSE,
OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.207
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
AMANDA.

40:39.207 --> 40:41.610
JACK HAS THE NICEST THINGS
TO SAY ABOUT YOU.

40:41.610 --> 40:44.513
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
MY HOME IS IN GOOD HANDS.

40:44.513 --> 40:47.646
IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE
FOR ME AND MY FATHER.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.648
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.

40:56.625 --> 40:58.527
THANK YOU.

41:05.594 --> 41:07.465
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.498
THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR DOING THIS.

41:09.498 --> 41:11.239
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

41:18.547 --> 41:20.709
STAY STRONG...

41:20.709 --> 41:22.480
AMANDA.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.753
YOU, TOO...

41:24.753 --> 41:26.715
EMILY.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.200
WE ALL HAVE SECRETS

41:42.200 --> 41:45.704
WE KEEP LOCKED AWAY
FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD...

41:47.536 --> 41:50.539
FRIENDSHIPS WE PRETEND...

41:52.541 --> 41:55.283
RELATIONSHIPS WE HIDE...

41:55.283 --> 41:56.685
(beeps)

41:56.685 --> 41:59.718
(keypad beeping)

42:02.651 --> 42:05.223
(phone rings)

42:05.223 --> 42:06.755
(man)Hai. Moshi-moshi.

42:06.755 --> 42:09.598
IT'S EMILY THORNE.

42:09.598 --> 42:11.660
I'M READY TO CONTINUE
MY TRAINING.

42:11.660 --> 42:14.532
THEN IT'S TIME
YOU COME TO JAPAN.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.535
I'LL LEAVE TOMORROW.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.608
BUT WORST OF ALL...

42:19.608 --> 42:21.740
LOVE WE NEVER LET SHOW.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.713
THE MOST DANGEROUS SECRETS
A PERSON CAN BURY

42:24.713 --> 42:27.275
ARE THOSE WE KEEP
FROM OURSELVES.
