00:33.660 --> 00:36.829
Papa's name is Checco.
He's 36 and

00:37.080 --> 00:38.665
from the South.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.041
Tall

00:40.333 --> 00:42.794
handsome, cool, muscular

00:42.835 --> 00:46.589
he's NOT. But he's really
nice and likeable.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.843
First he worked in the
world of high finance.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.221
Excuse me, how's the Dow Jones?

00:53.346 --> 00:55.348
Down a point and a half.

00:55.431 --> 00:58.476
Trust me, the situation's dramatic...

00:59.227 --> 01:02.105
Welcome back to our hotel.
Your party's waiting.

01:02.855 --> 01:05.233
I warned you not to disturb the clients!

01:05.567 --> 01:06.067
But...

01:06.359 --> 01:08.111
Forget it. I'm not interested.

01:08.486 --> 01:13.491
- What if someone asks a question?
- Back to work! Beat it! Scram!

01:15.868 --> 01:20.123
But in that situation papa
didn't feel appreciated.

01:20.456 --> 01:24.961
And so one day in September he
came up with a brilliant idea

01:25.336 --> 01:28.214
that would change his destiny.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.383
And he rushed to tell mama.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.137
Honey!

01:36.139 --> 01:38.141
What's up? Why the face?

01:38.224 --> 01:41.769
They're closing the factory.
Your news?

01:41.894 --> 01:43.771
I quit my job today.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.774
I want to be leadership of myself.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.611
Infected by mama's enthusiasm

01:49.652 --> 01:52.739
papa plunged into a job hunt.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.366
But at first it wasn't easy.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.910
Sorry, your profile's inadequate.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.245
Are you sure?

01:59.287 --> 02:00.913
But then one day...

02:01.039 --> 02:03.124
Zalone

02:03.416 --> 02:04.626
you're hired!

02:04.751 --> 02:06.628
Thank you, thank you.

02:09.297 --> 02:13.509
Stubbornly determined, papa found
the job that would allow him to

02:13.801 --> 02:16.262
achieve his aspirations.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.139
'Cause papa says that in life...

02:18.181 --> 02:20.391
Aspiration is everything!

02:20.433 --> 02:25.647
Look Aunties... the King of
House Cleaningship. A bargain!

02:25.688 --> 02:27.065
So...?!

02:27.190 --> 02:29.275
- We'll buy it!
- Go Aunties!

02:29.317 --> 02:31.694
Papa proved to be quite competent.

02:32.070 --> 02:36.699
You got yourself a bargain, cousin!
And you'll exercise too!

02:36.949 --> 02:40.328
Your nephew, Checco.
That's who we bought it from!

02:40.411 --> 02:42.413
Eh? Who's Checco?

02:42.455 --> 02:45.917
- Salesman of the year!
- Thank you!

02:45.958 --> 02:47.043
And well-deserved

02:47.335 --> 02:49.295
recognition soon followed.

02:49.921 --> 02:54.676
I just wanna say
to my wife and son...

02:58.179 --> 02:59.931
I love you!

03:01.474 --> 03:05.103
Daniela, Nicolo... look at papa!

03:09.482 --> 03:14.862
Riding the wave of success,
papa indulged in a few whims.

03:15.822 --> 03:18.741
Full optional, isn't it fantastic?

03:18.825 --> 03:20.618
Yes, but...

03:20.743 --> 03:23.246
I also have great used bargains.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.624
Lots of gifts for me...

03:26.999 --> 03:30.878
Nicolo, their TAEG surtax is unbeatable!

03:30.962 --> 03:32.880
TAEG! He's a TAEG!

03:33.005 --> 03:34.632
Happy, Taeg?

03:34.757 --> 03:38.010
and for mama, except
mama wasn't so happy.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.136
Nothing smaller?

03:39.345 --> 03:44.142
Gimme a smile for crying out loud!
I home-automated you!

03:44.267 --> 03:45.643
Watch and smile.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.895
We have Dolby Surround

03:47.979 --> 03:49.522
robotic blender...

03:49.647 --> 03:51.482
We have a self-cleaning

03:51.524 --> 03:52.900
defrosting microwave

03:53.025 --> 03:54.277
auto-griddle.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.028
We have a coffee maker.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.743
We have exceeded our 3 kilowatts!

04:03.286 --> 04:07.290
Papa teaches me that life
can have its darker moments.

04:07.623 --> 04:11.252
- Signora, interested?
- You're old! Look!

04:14.422 --> 04:18.176
Zalone, what's up? In six
months your sales dropped

04:18.551 --> 04:21.762
87.8%. Have you run out of

04:22.053 --> 04:24.932
- enthusiasm?
- No, out of relatives.

04:25.016 --> 04:27.935
But it's in hard times that
a real entrepreneur

04:28.311 --> 04:30.313
must find the answers.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.814
- Yes?
- The IRS.

04:31.898 --> 04:34.025
Sorry, we're Catholics here.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.319
Would you cool off?

04:36.569 --> 04:39.447
- They'll give it back.
- and seek solutions.

04:39.697 --> 04:45.453
We'll get a loan to pay the loans.
That's how it's done. Stop the tragedies!

04:45.536 --> 04:49.332
Please, just go away!
Disappear from my life!

04:49.457 --> 04:51.834
- Go away!
- You're being negative.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.086
- Hello?
- Fido-Fly.

04:54.212 --> 04:56.798
You'd better STAY
on your payment schedule!

04:56.839 --> 04:58.841
- Go!
- STAY or else!

04:58.966 --> 05:02.178
- Go away!
- Would you two make up your mind?!

05:02.220 --> 05:03.304
I'm not going!

05:03.346 --> 05:06.808
and above all try to do his very best.

05:06.849 --> 05:09.602
So lately he's always out working.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.479
You pack my toothbrush?

05:11.604 --> 05:13.981
Get financing and buy one!

05:14.106 --> 05:18.486
And so mama, Taeg and I moved
in with my grandparents.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.613
Can we eat without this thing?

05:20.988 --> 05:24.992
- Quiet! He's just a puppy.
- No less!

05:25.076 --> 05:28.246
- But papa calls me every day.
- Papa, where are you?

05:28.329 --> 05:32.375
At a restaurant, waiting on line.
The economy's picking up.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.711
The place is packed.
How's school going?

05:35.753 --> 05:38.130
Good... all A minus except two

05:38.214 --> 05:39.715
Bs and an A.

05:39.757 --> 05:43.511
Okay, let's do this, Nicolo.
If next term you get all As

05:44.095 --> 05:46.013
all As in all subjects

05:46.389 --> 05:49.267
I'll give you a dream vacation.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.769
You'll give me a vacation?

05:53.229 --> 05:57.358
Sister dearest, what's cooking today?
Tart's pasta?

05:57.400 --> 06:02.280
Papa's always joking, but when he makes
a promise, he's serious about keeping it.

06:03.489 --> 06:06.158
Time's up children!
Keep calm now.

06:06.284 --> 06:08.995
Nice and calm.
Pack your schoolbags.

06:12.665 --> 06:16.794
Three months later.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.676
Good boy!

06:24.677 --> 06:25.928
You should've studied harder.

06:26.012 --> 06:27.930
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:28.014 --> 06:28.931
Zalone.

06:29.015 --> 06:31.434
- Ah, Nicolo's father?
- Yes.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.148
Congratulations.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.817
- Why?
- Read.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.782
A

06:53.706 --> 06:55.207
May I speak to the teacher?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.543
- Why?
- The teacher please!

06:57.585 --> 06:59.337
She just left.

07:00.713 --> 07:02.548
Sonova...!

07:03.174 --> 07:06.552
Maybe you don't know that
Nicolo's mother and I

07:06.594 --> 07:07.970
recently separated.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.847
Yes, your wife told me.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.224
It's very hard on children who

07:12.350 --> 07:17.104
as you know, suffer the
consequences both psychologically and...

07:17.229 --> 07:19.815
- Yes, I know.
- ..scholastically.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.068
- So I'm wondering...
- What?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.861
How the hell is it possible that

07:23.986 --> 07:28.491
my son was unaffected?
He got all As! Please explain.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.742
- You're not happy?
- No.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.994
Because this monster you painted

07:32.328 --> 07:34.372
can't be my son, trust me!

07:34.455 --> 07:36.874
His parents separate and he excels?!

07:37.124 --> 07:40.753
In all subjects?! Look: History,
Italian, A, all As...

07:41.003 --> 07:44.507
Even in behaviour, A! No way!
When it's called for...

07:44.632 --> 07:48.719
I've never heard Nicolo
say a dirty word.

07:48.761 --> 07:52.640
In school, but at home he curses
like crazy, especially against you.

07:52.765 --> 07:56.769
"The old bitch should piss
off and retire!"

07:56.894 --> 07:59.605
And just yesterday? "She stinks!"
Let's check.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.273
And he's a liar!

08:01.399 --> 08:04.110
So, I mean, at least...
let's lower him on behaviour.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.487
Now listen - ...or gym!

08:06.529 --> 08:08.280
Listen a moment.

08:08.406 --> 08:11.033
I know all about
your economic situation.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.661
- What?
- And that you promised Nicolo

08:13.744 --> 08:16.372
- a wonderful vacation.
- Yes I did.

08:16.414 --> 08:21.544
- Seeing how Nicolo is very bright...
- Off the old block.

08:21.669 --> 08:25.423
He's capable of understanding.
So simply tell him the truth.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.508
- Tell him everything.
- Meaning?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.678
- The recession.
- Beg your pardon?

08:30.803 --> 08:32.304
The recession!

08:32.429 --> 08:33.806
In this factory

08:33.889 --> 08:37.434
we produced world class
fabrics. This stuff here!

08:37.518 --> 08:39.812
We were proud of our profession.

08:39.895 --> 08:43.315
Then this genius CEO showed up,

08:43.399 --> 08:47.028
and forced us to produce plain
cotton T-shirts. This stuff here!

08:47.069 --> 08:49.947
And that's how we plunged! Okay?

08:50.031 --> 08:53.534
My darling! What a good boy!

08:53.576 --> 08:55.953
Genetics never lie, eh!

08:57.079 --> 08:58.456
Now what?

08:59.582 --> 09:05.337
- I'll take him on vacation.
- Ah, vacation. Have you no shame?

09:05.463 --> 09:08.340
After ruining my life,
you could at least

09:08.674 --> 09:10.843
spare him! Where'll you go
seeing you're broke?!

09:10.968 --> 09:12.219
And so

09:12.344 --> 09:15.598
another glorious factory shuts
down and leaves its employees home

09:15.723 --> 09:18.684
laid off. How will they manage?

09:19.060 --> 09:21.103
Eh... we're desperate.

09:21.479 --> 09:26.734
Last year it was redundancy, now
they're throwing families on the street.

09:26.817 --> 09:30.362
I imagine your despair is
shared by other family members

09:30.488 --> 09:33.365
like your husband.
Do you have children?

09:33.449 --> 09:35.076
I'm on TV?

09:35.117 --> 09:36.827
- Any children?
- Yes yes.

09:36.869 --> 09:41.207
How do you see their future given
an outlook anything but rosy?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.375
Not Rosy 'cause he's a boy: Nicolo.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.504
I'm an entrepreneur and optimistic!

09:46.837 --> 09:49.965
There's too much pessimism!
Excuse me.

09:50.007 --> 09:53.761
We shouldn't forget that we're
the world's seventh economy,

09:53.886 --> 09:55.888
and Europe's third economy.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.890
- I am...
- Italy's first jerk!

09:57.973 --> 10:00.893
I'm convinced we'll make it, people!

10:01.143 --> 10:03.521
People! It only takes optimism.

10:03.896 --> 10:06.607
Here, look at my son's report card!

10:06.649 --> 10:08.734
Look! He got straight As.

10:08.776 --> 10:12.029
So how can I be a pessimist?

10:12.113 --> 10:13.906
Nicolo!

10:14.281 --> 10:17.785
Excuse me... if you're there
watching this crappy show

10:17.868 --> 10:21.413
that's injecting pessimism so
people won't consume anymore...

10:21.539 --> 10:24.125
Papa says he promised
a vacation, so...

10:24.166 --> 10:26.293
Bug off!
We're going on vacation!

10:26.418 --> 10:28.045
Yayyyy!

10:28.129 --> 10:31.799
- Pack your bags! They're only envious!
- Yessssss!

10:31.924 --> 10:33.425
Ciao Nicolo! Bug off!

10:33.551 --> 10:35.427
Super-papa! YAYYY!

10:36.637 --> 10:38.639
Papa, you have a valid passport?

10:38.681 --> 10:41.767
Of course. Gimme. Get inside.

10:44.395 --> 10:46.689
Off we goooo!

10:50.693 --> 10:55.948
- Hey, you gotta take him too!
- Shut up, you! Shut up!

11:00.786 --> 11:03.205
There's a superhero.

11:03.455 --> 11:07.084
Who beats all the others,
You know?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.588
He has no wings or missiles.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.048
He doesn't even have a rocket.

11:13.090 --> 11:17.970
You can say he's a
hero of our times...

11:18.053 --> 11:21.599
Enemy of the banks and loan sharks.

11:21.682 --> 11:25.477
Of the damned and monstrous downturn.

11:25.561 --> 11:28.981
Lying in ambush behind the corner.

11:29.106 --> 11:32.860
But he grabs a rag and wipes it out.

11:32.985 --> 11:36.572
And even flat broke he wins.

11:36.614 --> 11:39.992
Oh the magic power of...

11:40.618 --> 11:44.205
This SUUUUUUU...

11:45.247 --> 11:49.084
- Super-papa!
- Postdated checks!

11:49.126 --> 11:52.504
- Super-papa!
- Debt instalments!

11:52.630 --> 11:57.468
- Super-papa!
- Loans backed by family members!

11:58.260 --> 12:02.139
He's deep in poo
but he'll pull through!

12:02.223 --> 12:05.851
- Renegotiated mortgages!
- Super-papa!

12:05.893 --> 12:09.521
- IOUs up to the roof!
- Super-papa!

12:09.647 --> 12:13.025
A lien on grandma's pension!

12:15.027 --> 12:17.154
Come on, where you taking me?

12:17.238 --> 12:20.532
Nooo, it has to be a surprise!

12:20.658 --> 12:23.994
- You said it's in Europe, right?
- Yes.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.621
Come on, another hint!

12:26.997 --> 12:28.290
It's got six letters.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.417
London!

12:32.169 --> 12:33.796
- Madrid!
- No.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.048
Paris!

12:36.298 --> 12:37.925
What then?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.177
Okay I'll tell you. Look!

12:50.688 --> 12:51.939
You're joking, right?

13:21.552 --> 13:24.346
- Who could this be?
- You don't know?!

13:24.972 --> 13:26.098
Checco...

13:26.181 --> 13:28.225
- Checco.
- Checco!

13:28.559 --> 13:30.102
Auntie Ritella!

13:30.227 --> 13:31.854
Checco!

13:32.479 --> 13:35.357
- Remember me?
- It's been ages!

13:35.441 --> 13:36.984
Thirty years, Auntie.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.111
- The boy?
- He's Nicolo

13:39.236 --> 13:41.196
my son - Finally I

13:41.488 --> 13:43.824
meet him! What brings you here?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.243
- We're on vacation.
- Where you staying?

13:46.368 --> 13:48.954
Here with you.
Our bags. Come on!

14:00.341 --> 14:01.717
Incredible!

14:01.842 --> 14:05.095
Nothing's changed.
Same beds, same closet.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.889
All the same.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.642
Come to papa, come...

14:10.768 --> 14:13.020
You should know that papa

14:13.145 --> 14:18.525
when he was your age, spent his
first vacation here. This very place.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.403
Incredible... it's fantastic.

14:21.779 --> 14:24.531
And it's a fact: My first night here

14:24.907 --> 14:28.035
right in this bed, I made pee-pee.

14:28.160 --> 14:32.164
Did Auntie get pissed off
the next morning!

14:32.289 --> 14:33.999
It was right here.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.669
No! The stain...
is still there! Fantastic!

14:37.795 --> 14:40.631
And the same Mold,
the same humidity.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.925
Ah... know why
those cracks are there?

14:43.008 --> 14:44.927
- Why?
- Earthquakes.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.055
Ti-ti-ti-ti-ti, we'll have fun.

14:48.305 --> 14:52.684
Best we call mama...
and the child rescue line.

14:55.396 --> 14:57.064
Mr. Surace, good morning!

14:57.189 --> 14:59.817
Zalone, where the fuck are you?

14:59.900 --> 15:03.570
Are you working?
Are you pounding your area?

15:03.654 --> 15:07.574
No need to worry, sir
because I'm here in Molise

15:07.699 --> 15:11.453
where there's a strong family
presence and as you know that's

15:11.578 --> 15:13.580
my target - Of course.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.791
I already made a client list

15:16.166 --> 15:18.210
and they're all penetrable.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.087
Open your ears, Zalone.

15:20.170 --> 15:24.842
If this week you don't sell at
least seven vacuum cleaners

15:24.967 --> 15:26.969
you're out!

15:34.226 --> 15:38.605
Eh no! That's twice. He's not
paying the water. It costs!

15:38.981 --> 15:41.608
So Auntie, are you happy to

15:41.733 --> 15:43.735
- see us?
- Yes.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.237
Hell, we're never in touch.

15:45.362 --> 15:49.867
I know nothing about our relatives.
How are they? What are they doing?

15:52.369 --> 15:54.204
Eh... Auntie Pina, how is she?

15:55.747 --> 15:57.624
She's there.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.711
What a shame.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.714
Aunt Madia?

16:06.341 --> 16:08.635
Aunt Madia too.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.387
- Aunt Angela?
- There.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.018
Auntie Rosa... which corner?

16:16.393 --> 16:17.519
No, Rosa isn't dead.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.606
- Survived?
- She's in Canada

16:20.981 --> 16:22.232
with her daughters.

16:22.483 --> 16:27.029
Damn! Canada with her
daughters... so even Margherita

16:27.404 --> 16:28.614
Rosanna, Elena

16:28.906 --> 16:29.907
all in Canada.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.492
Know who's still here?

16:31.533 --> 16:35.871
Onofrio, your cousin.
He got married,

16:35.913 --> 16:37.915
and has 2 boys your son's age.

16:37.998 --> 16:42.002
Onofrio's wife... is she
into housecleaning?

16:42.878 --> 16:45.672
- The hell do I care?!
- Okay, calm down.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.510
Let's go Nicolo, time to play!

16:49.551 --> 16:51.929
You're gonna play dressed like that?

16:52.054 --> 16:57.142
While Papa runs an errand, you'll
play with the other kids in town.

16:57.184 --> 17:01.813
Come on, they're all waiting.
Curious to find out who Nicolo is.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.943
Let's go Nicolo, time to play!

17:27.422 --> 17:31.843
Wait... wait... there's gonna be kids.

17:32.594 --> 17:33.554
G'morning.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.098
Do you know if there's a place here

17:36.181 --> 17:38.475
in town like... a school yard

17:38.600 --> 17:41.103
where kids can play?

17:41.353 --> 17:44.356
Or even a park where

17:44.439 --> 17:50.862
a playground where
kids meet other kids?

17:51.238 --> 17:54.616
All right, they're like
men, only smaller

17:54.992 --> 17:58.996
without beards and
higher voices and

17:59.371 --> 18:01.373
at around thirteen they get fuzzy.

18:01.999 --> 18:05.711
- Excuse me... Town Hall please?
- Who for?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.213
- The Mayor.
- I'm the Mayor.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.757
I brought my son here on vacation.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.385
- You're a doofus!
- Thank you.

18:16.638 --> 18:21.476
- These places are so beautiful.
- Sure, papa, maybe with friends.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.270
Don't worry.

18:23.353 --> 18:27.274
- Papa, where are we going?
- To Onofrio's, my cousin.

18:27.399 --> 18:30.360
He's got two boys your age.

18:30.402 --> 18:34.156
When I used to come here
we were always together.

18:34.531 --> 18:39.161
He's a bundle of laughs.
Just you wait and see.

18:39.244 --> 18:43.915
One day my wife says she's
fed up with small-town life,

18:43.999 --> 18:46.668
and wants to move to the big city.

18:46.752 --> 18:48.879
So she ran off with another man.

18:48.920 --> 18:49.796
To Milan?

18:49.921 --> 18:51.882
To Isernia.

18:52.132 --> 18:56.803
Onofrio, women have these moments of
confusion. You gotta understand her.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.430
How are the boys?

19:02.684 --> 19:04.311
Dead?

19:04.561 --> 19:06.688
- She took them with her.
- Ah...

19:07.648 --> 19:09.399
She took them...

19:09.441 --> 19:13.528
- There's nobody left in this house.
- Completely alone now, eh?

19:13.570 --> 19:15.822
How do you manage, Onofrio?

19:15.947 --> 19:17.532
With the housecleaning?

19:17.574 --> 19:22.329
Look how dirty! Full of mites! If your
wife comes back, she'll run away again.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.915
Onofrio, you're a lucky man.

19:24.956 --> 19:30.295
I... You lucky bugger! I've got
a product that's just right for you.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.963
This here... wait!

19:32.089 --> 19:37.302
This month we're offering 30% off
to abandoned men of the South.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.097
- We used to have that very one.
- Used to.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.098
She took it.

19:41.181 --> 19:47.104
- I'll write up the contract.
- in the closet.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.732
Blessed woman... Where are they?

19:51.108 --> 19:55.237
Checco look... she left it!
She left it here!

19:58.240 --> 20:01.243
Took the kids, left the cleaner?

20:01.326 --> 20:04.830
- The whore!
- You said to be understanding.

20:04.871 --> 20:09.251
You should've understood she's a whore.
Not now. Before you married her!

20:17.509 --> 20:19.761
Where the fuck does this shit go?

20:19.886 --> 20:22.889
Would you stop cursing?!
That TV doesn't

20:22.973 --> 20:25.892
- have a SCART plug.
- They're not curses,

20:25.976 --> 20:27.894
but solution-finding formulas.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.857
There is no solution!
The TV's $0 years old!

20:33.150 --> 20:35.610
No! No!

20:39.364 --> 20:42.868
I left this here thirty years
ago. Know what it is?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.536
What?

20:55.297 --> 20:56.923
What's this noise?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.051
Blood and hell!

21:00.177 --> 21:04.681
What the...?! Are you outta
your mind? Electricity costs!

21:05.015 --> 21:07.058
- You're crazy!
- What can it cost?

21:07.142 --> 21:11.271
- Look at the bill they sent me!
- A two-month totalling 6 Euros!

21:11.313 --> 21:15.901
In August I pay 4 Euros,
at most 5, but 6 never!

21:15.942 --> 21:19.780
- It's a tragedy!
- The boy needs fun. A little humanity!

21:19.821 --> 21:21.823
- Come on!
- Now I'll

21:21.948 --> 21:24.701
show him fun! Relax. Nicolo!

21:24.785 --> 21:30.165
Pray for your children.

21:30.207 --> 21:35.545
Mother who can do all.

21:35.587 --> 21:40.091
And beg God's mercy!

21:40.217 --> 21:43.970
- Mama, you wouldn't believe it.
- Sweetie, listen to me. Tell

21:44.095 --> 21:47.474
papa to take you to
Piombino tomorrow.

21:47.557 --> 21:51.102
- Sokaina, what time?
- Noon. Assad will be waiting.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.480
You hear that? Don't you worry.

21:53.605 --> 21:56.107
- Tell him not to be late!
- Okay.

21:56.233 --> 21:59.110
- Ciao darling, ciao.
- Ciao. Goodnight.

22:00.111 --> 22:03.740
My poor boy! What did I do to
deserve this? What did I do?!

22:05.492 --> 22:07.494
Nicolo!

22:08.870 --> 22:10.497
Nicolo!

22:13.500 --> 22:15.627
Oh! What are you doing?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.630
Ehm... I talked to mama.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.007
You tell her everything's fine?

22:21.091 --> 22:23.718
Tomorrow I have to go to Piombino.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.346
Piombino? What for?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.723
To leave on vacation with Sokaina.

22:29.641 --> 22:32.978
Papa takes you on
vacation and you split?!

22:33.353 --> 22:34.896
Don't treat me like an idiot!

22:35.272 --> 22:39.651
You leave with me, today we arrive
and tomorrow you wanna leave?

22:39.734 --> 22:43.530
I studied all year for this vacation
because I really cared. You

22:43.613 --> 22:46.741
- instead, came to sell vacuum cleaners!
- Calm down.

22:46.783 --> 22:51.496
Vacation?! I would've had more fun at
home with friends. Tomorrow we're going!

22:51.538 --> 22:53.415
- Why?
- 'Cause we're going!

22:53.540 --> 22:56.376
- Why?
- 'Cause you've pissed me off!

22:59.045 --> 23:00.171
Nicolo!

23:01.882 --> 23:06.052
Come here right now!
Come on, over here!

23:07.137 --> 23:09.055
Repeat what you said!

23:09.890 --> 23:11.766
You're selling vacuum cleaners.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.894
No, what you said after.

23:13.935 --> 23:17.814
- Tomorrow we're...
- What you said after that...

23:18.940 --> 23:22.903
- You've pissed me off!
- So then you're normal!

23:24.195 --> 23:25.822
Come here!

23:26.448 --> 23:28.825
I was gonna take you to a therapist.

23:29.075 --> 23:34.080
No bad words, never a bad word.
I waited but never any bad words.

23:34.581 --> 23:38.835
Let's go to sleep now. Just relax,
there's no need to worry.

23:38.919 --> 23:41.713
How many things I've missed, my boy!

23:42.589 --> 23:45.592
Sorry, but I choke up when

23:45.717 --> 23:51.097
I think I missed the first time
you said a bad word.

23:51.181 --> 23:55.352
- Go to sleep now. Are you all right?
- Yes, but who are they?

23:55.477 --> 24:01.608
Who? Ah, that's a compilation

24:01.733 --> 24:04.486
that Auntie makes every year

24:04.611 --> 24:08.448
a sort of "Deathmania 2013",
don't worry about it.

24:08.823 --> 24:12.869
- Hey, you're all cold!
- Yeah. I feel a little cold.

24:14.120 --> 24:18.875
Wait here... Hold the light...
now I'll teach her a lesson.

24:23.505 --> 24:25.131
The old bitch had one!

24:37.227 --> 24:39.354
This consumes a whole lot!

24:58.999 --> 25:02.293
Nicolo, let's go!
Ciao Auntie. We're going.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.171
Not having breakfast?

25:05.672 --> 25:08.133
No, it'll cause heaviness.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.760
- Let's go.
- Nicolo

25:10.802 --> 25:14.764
come here. Auntie has a
nice gift for you.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.937
See how Auntie, at heart...

25:22.272 --> 25:24.691
Never mind. Ciao.

25:30.572 --> 25:35.035
Weren't you the one
who spoke of serenity.

25:35.076 --> 25:38.788
In those moments of what now?

25:39.831 --> 25:43.918
Like you said, the higher the hill.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.839
The more fun the ride down.

25:49.174 --> 25:56.473
What happened now papa?

25:57.849 --> 26:05.849
Don't you feel the buckets
of sunshine on your skin?

26:07.984 --> 26:15.984
You can ride on my shoulders,
pull hard on the suspenders.

26:16.743 --> 26:20.872
And we'll fly away from here!

26:26.127 --> 26:28.004
Papa, are you sad?

26:30.256 --> 26:32.884
Is papa the kind
that gets discouraged?

26:32.967 --> 26:35.261
Let's go, come on!

26:35.386 --> 26:37.347
Remind those people

26:37.388 --> 26:41.142
that we did a lot for them.
Now it's their turn. Rub it in!

26:41.226 --> 26:43.144
Okay? Come here!

26:47.649 --> 26:49.275
Go now.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.657
How could you even dream
of doing such a thing?!

27:37.699 --> 27:39.826
You were crying like a baby!

27:39.951 --> 27:41.828
Me?

27:42.412 --> 27:45.540
You don't know your father.
You still don't know him.

27:46.541 --> 27:50.295
- Now there'll be a fight with mama.
- Anyway you're separated.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.715
Who told you that? We're not
separated, me and your mother.

27:53.798 --> 27:56.718
- Pa, cut the bullshit!
- Nicolo!

27:56.801 --> 27:59.679
bad words must be
authorized by me!

28:00.180 --> 28:01.681
Your mother and I, yes

28:01.723 --> 28:06.102
- we're going through a momen...
- "Momentary downturn," I know.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.483
But we love each other.
Trust me. We'll be together again,

28:12.609 --> 28:14.235
and next year

28:14.319 --> 28:17.488
God willing, the stork will bring
you a brother. Okay?

28:17.697 --> 28:21.492
Stork? Papa, am I authorized
to call you a dork?

28:22.952 --> 28:24.704
You're becoming a big man!

28:24.996 --> 28:27.248
You're becoming a big stinker!

28:28.124 --> 28:29.124
Papa, a zoo!

28:29.375 --> 28:31.961
There's a sign. Look, a zoo!

28:57.111 --> 28:59.489
Excuse me, boy.

29:00.156 --> 29:03.159
Do you know where the zoo is?

29:03.910 --> 29:05.411
Boy.

29:06.663 --> 29:08.665
Boy?

29:08.748 --> 29:11.042
Oh! Boy!

29:11.125 --> 29:14.170
Where's the zoo?
Seeing there's a sign.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.260
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE ZOO IS?

29:20.301 --> 29:23.179
- It's here.
- That's the zoo?

29:23.263 --> 29:26.140
And your goldfish
is the Genoa aquarium?

29:26.182 --> 29:28.393
Humility boy! What's your name?

29:29.686 --> 29:31.688
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?!

29:31.813 --> 29:33.314
Lorenzo.

29:33.398 --> 29:35.191
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

29:36.317 --> 29:37.317
There.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.028
Zoe, selective mutism

29:39.320 --> 29:42.031
in children is a transient disorder.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.285
But it's a year that
Lorenzo hasn't spoken.

29:45.576 --> 29:50.415
We'll continue with the breathing
exercises... hippotherapy... herbs.

29:50.707 --> 29:53.668
- And maybe some medications.
- No, please no drugs!

29:53.793 --> 29:55.712
Mild remedies.

29:55.837 --> 29:59.090
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29:59.215 --> 30:05.805
- I just spoke to Lorenzo. He told me.
- Excuse me my son talked to you?

30:05.847 --> 30:08.850
- Yes, Lorenzo.
- He told you his name?

30:08.933 --> 30:11.602
- It's a secret?
- Where is he?

30:12.979 --> 30:16.607
Over there with my son. Nicolo!

30:17.734 --> 30:19.736
Nicolo! Nicolo!

30:20.737 --> 30:23.865
- I'm afraid of big dogs.
- Mine's a Great Dane.

30:23.990 --> 30:28.870
Danes are huge, aren't they?
But I heard they're friendly.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.497
- Do you play soccer?
- Yes.

30:32.248 --> 30:35.585
Ever been to a zoo?
You know how dolphins sleep?

30:35.626 --> 30:37.128
How?

30:39.756 --> 30:41.883
Two kids.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.887
Excuse me for insisting, but

30:46.262 --> 30:49.140
describe the dynamics of your
encounter with Lorenzo?

30:49.390 --> 30:52.393
Again? Okay, for the last time.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.896
I called him normally: "boy!"

30:54.979 --> 30:57.482
Nothing, he wouldn't answer.
At that point...

30:57.523 --> 31:01.277
I raised my voice: "BOY!"

31:01.402 --> 31:06.240
And the boy began to...
Excuse me, but who are you?

31:06.282 --> 31:09.035
I'm the psychologist
tending to Lorenzo.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.538
He only needs an
ear doctor... Earwax.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.040
Have him prescribe...

31:14.165 --> 31:18.419
Ear picks and you've solved
the problem, all right?

31:18.544 --> 31:20.797
I have to leave now... Nicolo!

31:20.922 --> 31:23.424
- Keep him here!
- Where are you headed?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.511
- We're looking for a hotel.
- You can stay here!

31:26.552 --> 31:29.931
- I can't accept. For free?
- Yes. - I accept.

31:30.139 --> 31:35.061
- Zoe is the name of an art gallery?
- Now I'm featuring this photographer.

31:35.186 --> 31:36.938
Very talented.

31:38.022 --> 31:40.942
That? How do you like it?
It's an old model.

31:41.067 --> 31:44.904
- That's the oeuvre of a French artist.
- Ah an oeuvre.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.657
The canvas represents Culture

31:48.783 --> 31:51.536
degraded by the presence
of an element

31:51.828 --> 31:55.081
such as a vacuum cleaner,
a typical objected portraying

31:55.164 --> 32:00.211
the wretchedness of man,
his degradation and annihilation.

32:00.837 --> 32:06.592
A world you wouldn't want
to know, but which sadly exists.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.428
- Is the artist alive?
- Yes.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.721
- Let's hope he dies.
- Why?

32:10.847 --> 32:16.727
Better if under a train,
annihilated... offended.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.481
- This way.
- Your mother's canary!

32:22.442 --> 32:26.612
Nuts, millet seed
with wild asparagus. Delicious!

32:26.737 --> 32:29.866
Basmati with turmeric, which I adore!

32:29.949 --> 32:33.369
Soy bean sprouts with algae,
amaranth with

32:33.453 --> 32:36.497
pumpkin and sunflower seeds.
Joy for the palate!

32:36.622 --> 32:39.876
Ehm... a slice of meat
for the boy?

32:40.001 --> 32:42.628
We're vegan, sorry.

32:42.712 --> 32:47.216
All right, no problem. I'll eat...
what's this? Millet.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.028
Ciao mama, I'm having a blast!

33:07.737 --> 33:10.907
Ciao Daniela. We're here
at hippotherapy with Zoe.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.242
The boy is doing fine.

33:13.534 --> 33:18.289
He made friends with Lorenzo
Zoe's son, and other problem kids.

33:18.414 --> 33:22.793
What can I say? We're fine. My best
to your colleagues. Optimism!

33:23.669 --> 33:25.505
Who is this Zoe?

33:26.297 --> 33:28.299
I'm a yoga enthusiast.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.558
- Your son's first time?
- No, he was a

33:37.934 --> 33:41.562
breather from early on.
He was born that way.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.566
- Hello.
- Hello.

33:52.156 --> 33:53.199
Let's go.

33:53.324 --> 33:56.911
I need to talk to the master.
Go, I'll be right there.

33:56.953 --> 33:58.704
G'morning - Exhi!

33:58.788 --> 34:01.165
- Oh sorry.
- Exhi's my name.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.708
Ah for crying...

34:04.168 --> 34:05.711
Relax.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.340
- I was observing you.
- I know.

34:09.966 --> 34:14.053
And you gave the impression of
someone with many questions inside.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.597
- Yes.
- But I think one question

34:16.847 --> 34:19.100
is more important than the others.

34:19.183 --> 34:20.810
- Yes.
- Ask it.

34:20.851 --> 34:23.228
How do you dust your carpets?

34:23.312 --> 34:26.482
Because I sell vacuum cleaners
with special nozzles.

34:26.565 --> 34:30.069
Because we've got a 1139 Euro
offer. Wanna buy it?

34:33.072 --> 34:34.949
Need to meditate on it?

34:39.370 --> 34:42.248
- Where we going?
- To a movie set.

34:42.498 --> 34:46.335
A movie set? Really? Professional
or crappy make-believe?

34:46.627 --> 34:48.254
No, professional.

34:48.588 --> 34:50.464
- Nicolo!
- Yes?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.134
- Ever been to a movie set?
- No never.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.885
It's a real blast!

34:55.011 --> 34:57.346
Pull out this plug.

34:58.472 --> 35:01.267
I no longer wish to
nourish this body.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.644
Feed me no longer

35:03.769 --> 35:06.230
this daily bread of bitterness.

35:06.272 --> 35:09.025
- CUT!!!
- Cut! Cut!

35:13.279 --> 35:14.905
- It's not right.
- No, not right.

35:15.740 --> 35:19.535
To me she reeks of bourgeoisie.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.871
Hey, I smelled it too.

35:21.912 --> 35:25.374
I figured it was from outside.
Fuck's sake, wash!

35:25.416 --> 35:27.168
And a girl no less!

35:27.293 --> 35:30.671
I've got it. Instead of a
monologue a dialogue!

35:30.755 --> 35:32.298
Yes, brilliant!

35:32.423 --> 35:35.885
With someone who urges
her to go on living.

35:35.926 --> 35:38.137
- You're a genius.
- A genius!

35:38.304 --> 35:39.555
Just anyone, like

35:39.639 --> 35:43.809
a prototype of the average
Italian. Nondescript - Yes yes.

35:43.934 --> 35:48.272
Eh... those faces devoid of a certain...

35:54.403 --> 35:57.531
"Euthanasia Mon Amour"
85A, take one!

35:58.074 --> 36:00.284
Pull this plug!

36:00.576 --> 36:03.329
No, no, I will not unplug you.

36:03.412 --> 36:08.959
You can't decree your end. Nobody has
that right. Life is an "inalenable"...

36:09.085 --> 36:10.336
"Inalienable" papa!

36:10.419 --> 36:13.464
Sorry... Life is an
inalienable papa gift.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.675
No, no. I won't pull this

36:15.716 --> 36:18.094
- plug. Eat this bread!
- CUT!

36:18.177 --> 36:20.471
It needs to be simpler.

36:20.554 --> 36:24.600
As if you were in your town
talking to a girlfriend, okay?

36:24.684 --> 36:26.352
Yo, eat yer sandwich!

36:26.477 --> 36:31.232
You're skin and bones. Look at you!
A little fat is good for you!

36:32.233 --> 36:34.068
Eat!

36:34.110 --> 36:35.611
- My mother's style.
- CUT!

36:35.736 --> 36:38.489
Just give her the bread
and be mute, please!

36:38.614 --> 36:43.077
You yum-yum sandwich!
Or you die! You skinny-skinny!

36:43.119 --> 36:47.623
Skinny-skinny bad. Sandwich good-good.
- CUT! CUT!

36:47.707 --> 36:49.458
CUT!

36:49.875 --> 36:53.838
- Thank you, it's a wrap.
- If she's a dud...

36:53.879 --> 36:55.506
Whaddya want from me?

36:56.006 --> 36:57.883
Just a second, Lorenzo.

36:58.092 --> 37:02.847
- A debacle, damn them!
- Ludovico, wait!

37:13.524 --> 37:15.276
I don't know what got into him.

37:15.401 --> 37:18.779
- Zoe! Did something happen?
- No, nothing.

37:18.904 --> 37:22.032
- Was it me?
- No, it's not you.

37:22.116 --> 37:25.119
No, 'cause normally I act.
But let's say that...

37:25.161 --> 37:30.791
This director Ludovico, is a bit...
- He's an asshole!

37:30.875 --> 37:33.544
Come on, don't talk like that
in front of the children.

37:33.627 --> 37:37.173
He's a dumb-ass, that's what,
a bit of a dumb-ass.

37:40.885 --> 37:44.805
No, on set I didn't realize that
he was Lorenzo's father

37:44.889 --> 37:46.432
the director.

37:46.557 --> 37:48.058
I'm afraid I said things that...

37:48.142 --> 37:52.938
He promised to spend time with him.
Instead, he's stuck on the film.

37:53.022 --> 37:57.026
You told me this at eleven,
now it's one. Time to go to bed.

37:57.067 --> 38:02.156
He doesn't understand how his
behaviour is hurting Lorenzo.

38:03.199 --> 38:04.408
You already said that too.

38:04.450 --> 38:08.162
- He's a totally nonaffective person.
- Nonaffective.

38:08.204 --> 38:11.290
- Incapable of feeling sentiment.
- Sentiment.

38:11.332 --> 38:16.170
- He sacrificed interaction with his son.
- Sacrificed... interaction... son...

38:16.212 --> 38:20.090
- And that's the cause of Lorenzo's mutism.
- cause... Lorenzo's mutism.

38:20.216 --> 38:24.678
I know... it's better now...

38:24.720 --> 38:27.723
I lost ten years of
my life with him.

38:28.599 --> 38:31.936
No... my boy... it's not what...

38:32.728 --> 38:34.480
Dummy!

38:34.563 --> 38:39.443
There's nothing... silly... wait Zoe!

38:39.485 --> 38:44.824
My son saw us from the window and
it looks like... Know what I mean?

38:48.077 --> 38:51.997
Zoe... I'm asking you please...
Come on!

39:01.966 --> 39:04.260
Checco, can we go swimming?

39:04.635 --> 39:05.635
You're nuts!

39:05.761 --> 39:07.012
It's fantastic!

39:07.346 --> 39:10.516
Lorenzo... it's $ in the
morning, go to sleep, please.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.769
Then can we hunt fireflies?

39:14.144 --> 39:17.147
Last year, one night
there were tons of them.

39:18.649 --> 39:22.278
- You gotta tell jokes now? Come on!
- Her name is Cecilia...

39:22.528 --> 39:25.781
- Photonic ray. Galactic eyes.
- You're a cruel bastard too!

39:25.906 --> 39:28.033
Galactic number 96.
Lepioscura...

39:28.158 --> 39:29.410
Listen to me!

39:29.535 --> 39:33.414
Do you know your papa is a
completely nonaffective person

39:33.539 --> 39:37.293
who abandoned every form of
interplay with you? That's right.

39:37.376 --> 39:40.254
Only caring about his ego.

39:40.296 --> 39:44.300
Ohhh... Did you get hit
by selective mutism?

39:44.383 --> 39:47.636
Good, now go to sleep.
Move it, back to bed, go!

39:47.678 --> 39:49.930
Tomorrow I'll unblock you.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.684
Switch off the light with mutism.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.525
Damn it... Yesterday Lorenzo
was doing so well!

40:01.567 --> 40:03.527
Can't they go to your mother's?

40:03.569 --> 40:06.071
I asked, but Checco has to leave.

40:06.155 --> 40:11.327
He said he's got a workshop with
Americans. He's a businessman.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.287
What a pity!

40:13.329 --> 40:15.080
Zalone, what's up?

40:15.164 --> 40:19.084
You were in Molise and you
didn't close one fucking deal?!

40:19.209 --> 40:21.587
Sir, you don't need to worry.

40:21.670 --> 40:24.673
Right! You're the one
who needs to worry!

40:25.215 --> 40:26.842
Goodbye.

40:27.718 --> 40:31.555
- Why can't we go with them?
- Nicolo, I told you why.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.849
You saw how they are.

40:33.974 --> 40:37.311
Floor beds, energy flows,
hippotherapy

40:37.353 --> 40:42.107
breathing...
They're Communists, Nicolo!

40:42.232 --> 40:45.110
My teacher taught me
not to discriminate,

40:45.194 --> 40:50.074
for political reasons, or ethnic reasons
or reasons of sexual orientation.

40:50.366 --> 40:52.993
- Shut your trap!
- You're narrow-minded!

40:53.077 --> 40:55.996
What if one day
I confess that I'm...

40:59.833 --> 41:01.961
- What?
- No, never mind.

41:03.253 --> 41:05.005
I got enough troubles...

41:05.089 --> 41:08.217
What were you saying?
What if you confess you're...?

41:08.258 --> 41:09.343
It was hypothetical.

41:09.385 --> 41:14.014
If we talk now, we can still do
something, there's still time.

41:14.098 --> 41:17.351
Come on... What if you confess
that you're...?

41:17.393 --> 41:19.770
- Homosexual.
- Aah!

41:21.855 --> 41:23.482
I thought Communist.

41:23.524 --> 41:26.485
Go take a hike! You scared me!

41:28.487 --> 41:32.157
- We're going with you!
- Really? Hurray!

41:32.282 --> 41:35.244
The human-sexuals
are people top to bottom.

41:35.285 --> 41:39.415
Just like us, us normal folks.

41:40.541 --> 41:45.045
They laugh, they cry,
they clap their hands.

41:45.170 --> 41:48.173
Even if they're a bit partial to ass.

41:50.509 --> 41:53.929
Pa, just put on jeans and
a T-shirt and let's go!

41:54.263 --> 41:58.392
No, my son. We have to live
like them and dress like them.

41:58.434 --> 41:59.685
To understand

41:59.810 --> 42:03.439
how that ideology burns
on the skin.

42:05.524 --> 42:08.652
Excuse me, do you also
have Che Guevara bags?

42:32.217 --> 42:35.220
- Good morning everybody!
- Welcome back, Lorenzo.

42:35.345 --> 42:38.474
Manuela, look after their needs.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.060
Thank you.

42:42.603 --> 42:43.937
This way, please. Good morning.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.939
Chardonnay, Chardonnay.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.233
This is your Alessian style suite.

42:48.317 --> 42:52.613
Here's the reading area. We've
prepared a welcome cocktail.

42:52.696 --> 42:55.699
This is the piano Chopin
played before his death.

42:55.741 --> 42:57.493
Kindly follow me.

43:04.458 --> 43:08.754
This is the Marco Polo room,
frescoed by Domenico Piola.

43:09.129 --> 43:13.759
A precious table from the 1700's,
decorated with lapis lazuli and albumen.

43:13.884 --> 43:17.888
The Oriental style bed was
a gift from Prince Scotto.

43:17.971 --> 43:19.598
Guests here have ranged

43:19.640 --> 43:22.101
from Queen Margherita to Hegel.

43:22.142 --> 43:25.354
- Hegel on this bed?
- You're an admirer?

43:25.395 --> 43:30.109
Eva Hegel, seen all her films!
Hope you changed the sheets though.

43:31.652 --> 43:33.612
Ah, I almost forgot.

43:33.654 --> 43:36.240
There's private temperature control.

43:36.532 --> 43:38.909
But there's a slight problem
with the ionizer.

43:39.243 --> 43:41.912
Eh, hell no!
And she saves it for last!

43:42.037 --> 43:45.165
A "slight problem!" Let's go...
or do we stay anyway?

43:45.290 --> 43:46.917
Yeah, okay.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.545
Humility. I like it. Humility.

43:50.379 --> 43:52.381
You have nine Euros change?

43:56.135 --> 43:58.262
I'll leave it on the lapis
lazuli... tomorrow.

43:59.638 --> 44:01.306
Come here my boy!

44:03.016 --> 44:05.561
Tell mama how much fun!

44:05.894 --> 44:07.938
- Ciao mama!
- Ciao Daniela.

44:08.313 --> 44:11.316
- Ciao!
- Ciao Daniela!

44:38.343 --> 44:42.848
Philip, Pino, bring me
a cocktail, please!

44:46.476 --> 44:48.353
Careful my boy. Careful!

44:55.861 --> 44:59.489
He's doing much better
Lorenzo, eh?

45:00.324 --> 45:02.367
Juliette - Look here!

45:03.702 --> 45:05.495
Vittorio is here.

45:06.872 --> 45:10.209
There'd be some papers to sign.

45:10.250 --> 45:11.877
Zoe, please come.

45:16.882 --> 45:18.133
Again?

45:20.135 --> 45:22.137
This stuff again?

45:22.763 --> 45:28.602
This "stuff" is a great opportunity for our companies.
- Our companies.

45:30.020 --> 45:34.107
After my father died
our firms stopped

45:34.149 --> 45:36.485
producing goods made with care.

45:36.526 --> 45:38.111
Now it's all

45:38.403 --> 45:42.115
just stock market
and financial activities.

45:42.157 --> 45:45.911
Sorry my dearest,
but after your father died

45:45.994 --> 45:49.122
you own 33% of the
company shares, yet you

45:49.164 --> 45:51.166
never showed any interest.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.668
What do you expect now?

45:52.751 --> 45:56.255
To give Vittorio
lessons in finance management?

45:57.130 --> 45:59.883
G'morning, how do you do?
Zalone.

45:59.925 --> 46:01.802
- Zoe's mama?
- Yes.

46:01.927 --> 46:05.931
Incredible. Your old age is
truly youthful, my compliments.

46:06.014 --> 46:07.432
The accountant?

46:07.557 --> 46:11.311
- Yes, in a way.
- Who are you?

46:11.687 --> 46:15.315
I'm Juliette's companion and the
managing director of their companies.

46:15.399 --> 46:17.943
Ah, in fact I heard you
talk about finance.

46:18.026 --> 46:19.945
I can offer my expertise...

46:20.028 --> 46:23.323
What outfit were
you discussing, Zoe?

46:23.407 --> 46:26.034
- I doubt you know it.
- Which? Which?

46:27.786 --> 46:30.831
Fido-Fly, headquartered in Milan?

46:30.914 --> 46:34.835
Represented by the Law Firm Zanoni
located in Brugherio?

46:34.918 --> 46:37.587
- Yes.
- How are you involved?

46:37.671 --> 46:39.965
We're buying them out.

46:40.090 --> 46:43.218
You want to buy out Fido-Fly?

46:43.343 --> 46:46.305
Holy! No! Really? You're joking?

46:46.346 --> 46:48.598
- No.
- Fido-Fly's in deep shit!

46:48.724 --> 46:51.476
Fido-Fly's going belly-up
in a couple of weeks.

46:51.601 --> 46:53.603
I'll explain Fido-Fly:

46:53.687 --> 46:58.692
It's a company that
lends money to riffraff.

46:58.734 --> 47:02.362
Loans galore! People take advantage of
their "TAEG." Know what TAEG is?

47:02.487 --> 47:03.322
It's...

47:03.363 --> 47:05.365
Annual percentage rate of change.

47:05.490 --> 47:06.950
Good boy! So what happens?

47:07.242 --> 47:08.327
The people taking

47:08.618 --> 47:11.079
their money are...
Hey, listen up!

47:11.121 --> 47:13.498
The borrowers are beggars

47:13.582 --> 47:17.627
with no collateral, strapped with
instalments they'll never pay.

47:17.753 --> 47:21.006
These Fido-Fly people
figure that those beggars

47:21.131 --> 47:22.841
with no pay checks

47:22.883 --> 47:25.260
will cough up the money!

47:25.344 --> 47:28.972
Hopeless dumbasses,
signora. My advice is

47:29.014 --> 47:31.391
to forget this buy-out.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.226
Signora, I already like you.

47:33.268 --> 47:34.603
Cross my heart.

47:34.644 --> 47:38.982
Forget Fido-Fly. Enjoy your old age.
See you tonight, good people!

47:40.400 --> 47:43.028
This individual will attend the gala?

47:43.153 --> 47:46.740
Who? My new companion? Yes.

47:52.913 --> 47:58.043
Fido-Fly here. You're late on 48
instalments. When are you settling?

47:58.168 --> 48:02.422
Not now, I'm too young to settle
Relax and fuck off.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.674
Tortello in pistachio sauce.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.429
It's ready. Strain it!

48:09.513 --> 48:11.306
If your father...

48:11.390 --> 48:13.183
If father could speak

48:13.266 --> 48:15.018
- he'd speak volumes.
- Who can't speak?

48:15.060 --> 48:16.436
My grandpa Riccardo.

48:16.520 --> 48:18.939
- He'd say you're irresponsible.
- Where is he?

48:19.022 --> 48:21.024
In heaven. Two years ago.

48:21.400 --> 48:24.444
- He wouldn't approve your sentiments.
- If your father could speak

48:24.528 --> 48:28.073
- he'd tell me to live my life.
- Wait, wait.

48:28.156 --> 48:29.699
He'd say you squandered...

48:29.783 --> 48:33.954
RICCARDO! Would you talk?!
Dumbass!

48:34.037 --> 48:37.290
Your grandson's mutism
is your fault!

48:50.720 --> 48:53.473
Vittorio, why did you drop Fido-Fly?

48:54.182 --> 48:56.810
The daughter withdrew her proxy.

48:56.852 --> 48:58.562
The spoiled brat.

48:58.854 --> 49:03.358
No, it's not that. Now she's put
her trust in a new companion.

49:03.483 --> 49:05.318
Ah yeah? Who is he?

49:08.989 --> 49:11.450
Idiot. What's with the clothes?

49:11.491 --> 49:15.871
No. Heads up...
He knows the score, okay?

49:24.629 --> 49:26.381
Come.

49:26.465 --> 49:29.759
Checco, meet Pier Giorgio,
a dear friend of my father.

49:29.843 --> 49:31.636
- A pleasure.
- Bollini, hello.

49:31.761 --> 49:33.722
- Zalone.
- Hermes, my wife.

49:33.763 --> 49:35.223
- How do you do?
- Hermes.

49:35.265 --> 49:37.392
She's my daughter, Olga.

49:39.519 --> 49:41.646
- Excuse me, isn't she...?
- No.

49:41.730 --> 49:44.649
- And she is...
- Wait, wait! The grandmother!

49:45.525 --> 49:50.113
- See you later. Let's mingle.
- Wait, let me talk... don't be rude!

49:51.281 --> 49:56.286
In this African village, the
children live in a desperate state.

49:57.287 --> 49:59.789
They have no water, no food.

50:01.166 --> 50:03.919
As you can see,
the houses are decrepit.

50:04.002 --> 50:07.297
So you can imagine
the health conditions.

50:07.422 --> 50:11.801
Nicolo - They have
no vaccines. And that's why

50:12.135 --> 50:14.554
thanks to the help
of Father Faberge

50:14.638 --> 50:19.267
we've decided to adopt this village!

50:20.185 --> 50:24.564
I'd like to ask my daughter
Zoe, and my grandson Lorenzo

50:24.689 --> 50:29.319
to come on stage
with the envelope

50:29.444 --> 50:31.446
proceeds of your offers.

50:32.447 --> 50:34.574
Good evening, thank you.

50:35.450 --> 50:36.910
Ehh, Giulietta

50:36.952 --> 50:40.330
the images were certainly shocking.

50:40.455 --> 50:44.960
I dunno about you,
but I got a lump in my throat.

50:45.043 --> 50:48.588
Excuse me, could I have
some Champagne please?

50:50.090 --> 50:51.967
- May we know...
- Vintage 2008?

50:53.301 --> 50:58.056
- May we know the amount, please?
- Yes, wait, right away.

51:01.851 --> 51:07.357
Excuse me, but I'm moved
because this check

51:07.482 --> 51:09.859
isn't postdated!

51:09.985 --> 51:12.862
Hey look... have you ever seen one?
- No, never.

51:12.946 --> 51:15.365
Your goodness is incredible!

51:15.490 --> 51:16.741
The amount please!

51:16.825 --> 51:18.451
$3,000 Euros!

51:19.995 --> 51:24.082
- $3,000 Euros.
- And indeed with $3,000 Euros...

51:24.124 --> 51:28.461
we can buy many things for the village.
- Many, many...

51:28.503 --> 51:30.630
many vacuum cleaners!

51:30.714 --> 51:33.883
Friends, hands are useless
against African mites.

51:33.967 --> 51:36.261
Maybe we can buy other things

51:36.386 --> 51:40.098
seeing how the power
station is six miles away.

51:40.140 --> 51:44.019
Extension cords!
Friends, with extension cords...

51:44.102 --> 51:47.606
Hey, Father Faberge,
with an extension cord you're OKAY!

51:48.023 --> 51:50.025
On with the gala!

51:50.150 --> 51:51.484
MUSIC!

51:54.779 --> 51:57.782
They're stealing our rights!

51:58.241 --> 52:02.787
Our dignity!
But we'll fight to the death

52:02.912 --> 52:04.748
to claim our rights!

52:04.789 --> 52:07.167
That's why today we're here

52:07.250 --> 52:10.420
instead of being with our children

52:10.503 --> 52:13.632
on a vacation
they'd deserve as well.

52:14.382 --> 52:17.427
- Ciao Daniela!
- Mama, it's beautiful here!

52:17.552 --> 52:20.680
- Regards to your colleagues!
- Ciao!

52:56.341 --> 52:59.719
Not very classy, but lots of fun.

52:59.844 --> 53:03.473
Juliette, is this Checco
Zoe's companion?

53:03.556 --> 53:05.600
No, he's just a friend.

53:05.725 --> 53:07.602
Are you sure?

53:10.188 --> 53:13.733
Son, you see, today we're here

53:13.817 --> 53:17.445
among these people, in
this luxury, aboard this yacht,

53:17.487 --> 53:20.615
and we feel good,
but careful my boy!

53:20.699 --> 53:23.493
You mustn't think this is happiness.

53:23.576 --> 53:27.080
- That's wise, Pa.
- 'Cause look over there, Nicolo!

53:27.122 --> 53:29.499
THAT'S happiness!
With a helicopter!

53:29.582 --> 53:31.084
- Cool off!
- Not this tub!

53:31.126 --> 53:33.253
- That's our goal!
- Calm down!

53:33.336 --> 53:37.507
- Together we'll tower over these people!
- Keep calm...

53:37.590 --> 53:39.634
And PUH! Sorry, sweetie!

53:39.718 --> 53:43.763
Because for me and you, son,
the sky's the limit, Nicolo!

54:04.242 --> 54:07.412
Mr. Manieri, thank you for
joining us.

54:07.495 --> 54:10.290
Indulge our curiosity:
Are you here on vacation?

54:10.415 --> 54:11.791
Vacation? What's that?

54:11.875 --> 54:16.629
- He's hot tonight.
- There are rumors that

54:16.671 --> 54:19.382
you'll be President
of the Manufacturers Group.

54:19.424 --> 54:22.677
Highly unlikely. Juliette would
throw me out. Wouldn't you?

54:24.429 --> 54:26.806
It's working, he's got them!

54:26.890 --> 54:28.933
- One question?
- Without a lawyer?

54:31.311 --> 54:33.438
Juliette, he's going really...

54:34.147 --> 54:37.692
I am absolutely in favor of

54:37.776 --> 54:40.528
Europe and the rules that

54:40.570 --> 54:43.573
our European partners have codified.

54:43.698 --> 54:48.077
Keep your lousy Europe
with its murderous HACCP!

54:48.828 --> 54:51.664
- Hear hear! Damned right!
- Quiet!

54:51.706 --> 54:55.043
I think women on the work force...

54:55.418 --> 54:59.547
Tell us about the costs of female
workers on maternity leave!

55:02.217 --> 55:03.718
This guy's out of his mind.

55:03.843 --> 55:06.095
Mr. Manieri,
I see someone who's upset.

55:06.179 --> 55:08.306
Bring him a microphone please.

55:09.599 --> 55:11.851
- Good evening.
- Care to ask a question?

55:11.976 --> 55:14.229
I'm offering answers, dear Kojak!

55:14.312 --> 55:15.730
Tonight I haven't felt

55:15.814 --> 55:19.067
any VAT numbers
throbbing in our hearts.

55:19.108 --> 55:20.985
It needs to be said.

55:21.569 --> 55:24.989
Vittorio, you're not ready
to represent us.

55:25.490 --> 55:31.371
Vittorio, you say "Europe,"
but you don't mention HACCP!

55:31.496 --> 55:33.373
It's... eh...

55:35.375 --> 55:39.128
"Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Points". Come on!

55:39.254 --> 55:41.631
Good boy. And what does it mean?

55:41.714 --> 55:43.716
If I produce a mozzarella

55:43.758 --> 55:47.887
I gotta write on the
cover wrap its expiry date

55:48.012 --> 55:49.347
that it was made by

55:49.389 --> 55:51.891
a certain cow living
in a certain country

55:51.975 --> 55:57.105
that the milk was in a refrigerated
cell at a certain temperature

55:57.146 --> 56:00.859
sterilized in accordance
with EU rules...

56:00.900 --> 56:03.152
Eat the mozzarella! Fuck's sake!

56:03.278 --> 56:06.155
Thank you.

56:07.657 --> 56:10.618
Vittorio, you talk about female labor.

56:10.660 --> 56:13.663
But when I the businessman hire

56:13.746 --> 56:20.044
a woman who gets pregnant,
I have to pay family allowance.

56:20.169 --> 56:24.674
I gotta substitute her. I gotta train
and pay her substitute.

56:24.799 --> 56:29.679
I gotta rehire and retrain her, 'cause
meantime she forgot everything.

56:29.762 --> 56:31.431
So you know what I say?

56:31.556 --> 56:36.311
Working girl, you wanna get pregnant?
Then I'll bang you! Me your employer!

56:36.394 --> 56:38.396
Thank you big-belly country!

56:38.438 --> 56:43.192
Like this we'll save the country!
That's the truth!

56:43.276 --> 56:45.320
Thank you! Autographs later.

56:50.074 --> 56:51.701
Will we be enjoying the company

56:52.076 --> 56:54.579
of your businessman much longer?

56:54.829 --> 56:57.415
- We're yours every single moment!
- Send him away!

57:00.335 --> 57:02.462
- Yeah papa!
- Go Checco!

57:02.587 --> 57:03.588
No, forget it!

57:03.713 --> 57:06.215
- Make friends with him.
- No!

57:06.299 --> 57:09.093
You're a natural. Make friends,
hang out together.

57:09.177 --> 57:12.972
Play golf, drink champagne. Operation
congeniality. Sometimes a smile

57:13.056 --> 57:18.436
goes a long way. C'mon, smile!
That's it excellent!

57:18.478 --> 57:21.481
You work on him
and I work on Zoe.

57:26.986 --> 57:29.197
- The stakes?
- Your choice.

57:29.238 --> 57:30.823
- Champagne!
- Champagne!

57:30.865 --> 57:32.742
- Five cases!
- Nooo!

57:32.825 --> 57:35.495
No, no, Vittorio. Ten cases!

57:35.620 --> 57:38.957
Ten, good! I like to play big.

57:39.248 --> 57:42.377
- Of course! It's the only way!
- Papa

57:42.460 --> 57:45.838
you don't have enough
for even one bottle!

57:46.631 --> 57:50.760
My son, so many things you need
to learn about economics!

57:52.387 --> 57:54.514
You see, banks

57:54.639 --> 57:57.725
when you have a piddling
debt, they hound you.

57:57.892 --> 58:01.896
For big debts instead,
they help you. Understand?

58:01.980 --> 58:04.857
We'll dig huge financial
holes together. Let's go.

58:04.899 --> 58:06.401
Twenty cases, Vittorio!

58:06.484 --> 58:09.153
Zoe, with all due respect, this

58:09.278 --> 58:12.532
Checco doesn't seem
to be such an expert.

58:12.657 --> 58:15.284
Ah no? Look at this.

58:16.786 --> 58:19.038
FIDO-FLY GOES BANKRUPT

58:19.163 --> 58:21.666
All the dirt on Fido-Fly

58:22.166 --> 58:26.504
- how did you know about it?
- Eh... I knew, I knew.

58:26.546 --> 58:30.008
- What's your expertise?
- Me? The cleaning sector.

58:36.264 --> 58:41.060
I knew you were a
Class A sonovabitch!

58:42.061 --> 58:44.564
Could you also "clean"
for our companies?

58:44.689 --> 58:47.066
- I clean everywhere, Vittorio.
- Discreetly.

58:47.150 --> 58:50.403
I never talk about other
people's dirt, Vittorio.

58:51.404 --> 58:56.534
- Then I guess we can work together.
- You've got lots of dust?

58:59.912 --> 59:02.331
Super-papa!

59:03.666 --> 59:06.085
Super-papa!

59:07.420 --> 59:09.464
Super-papa!

59:13.092 --> 59:16.846
He's in the poo
but he'll pull through!

59:18.473 --> 59:20.725
Super-papa!

59:22.560 --> 59:24.687
Super-papa!

59:26.731 --> 59:31.110
Okay then...
I'm already tasting the bubbles.

59:31.694 --> 59:35.740
I dunno, but I didn't imagine
you were such a good shot.

59:37.867 --> 59:40.328
If I sink this one

59:40.369 --> 59:42.747
I win - Go for it.

01:00:00.515 --> 01:00:03.017
- Yes!
- No!

01:00:03.101 --> 01:00:04.977
No eh!! You don't

01:00:05.019 --> 01:00:08.773
cheer mistakes.
It's not sportsmanlike!

01:00:08.898 --> 01:00:10.650
Checco, he's just a boy.

01:00:10.775 --> 01:00:13.736
He has to learn it's done like this!

01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:16.906
More contained, more elegant.
Okay, now it's my turn.

01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:26.415
Go papa, go papa...

01:00:51.399 --> 01:00:52.817
Yes!!! Hurray!

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.443
Yes!!

01:00:54.569 --> 01:00:56.195
You're the champion!

01:00:56.279 --> 01:00:57.822
You see your papa?

01:00:58.156 --> 01:01:00.825
The best! Yayyyy!

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.203
This time you won,
but in any case

01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:08.457
from now on
we're a team, right?

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.838
At your disposal, Vittorio.

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:18.342
- See how papa plays golf?
- Really well!

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:20.553
- Let's go boys.
- Where you going?

01:01:20.595 --> 01:01:23.097
- We'll change our clothes and go.
- Where?

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.349
- It's a secret.
- A secret?!

01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:28.603
- I can't come?
- No. See you tonight.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:36.861
- I know that you and Vittorio talked.
- It's all settled.

01:01:38.988 --> 01:01:41.365
Can we trust you?

01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:50.499
I said yes, guys. So relax.

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:53.961
Eh, speak of the...

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:56.464
Mr. Surace, g'morning.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.382
Well, the contracts?

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:02.637
Zalone? Zalone!

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.889
Hello... Can you hear me?

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:07.725
What the hell is that fool cooking?

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:09.727
Fuck! The battery's shot.

01:02:09.769 --> 01:02:13.397
- Take mine.
- Thanks, Vittorio. Just a sec, guys.

01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:17.777
Hello Mr. Surace, it's Checco.

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:20.029
Good going, Vittorio.

01:02:20.238 --> 01:02:24.283
Relax, Surace.
I'm in the middle of a huge deal.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:29.497
Let me explain: I'm here with Pier
Giorgio Bollini and Vittorio Manieri

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:33.542
who are both bigshots.
We're talking major business.

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:35.670
They have companies

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:37.672
in the Cayman Islands

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:40.174
which practically speaking

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:42.551
fill Chinese boxes
with dirty money.

01:02:42.677 --> 01:02:46.806
So you can imagine all the dust.
But they wanna clean 'em,

01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:48.891
so they called me.

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:53.145
Except they wanna clean 'em there
and bring 'em to Italy already cleaned.

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:56.023
But when I heard talk

01:02:56.065 --> 01:02:59.568
of the Cayman Islands,
well, I had a sudden doubt.

01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:01.320
Eh.

01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:06.575
Do they use a 3-prong plug?
'Cause without a 3-prong it's useless.

01:03:06.701 --> 01:03:08.661
I told you to offer Schuko!

01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:14.083
Zalone, just one thing: If by tomorrow
I don't see a contract you're fired!

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:19.922
So guys, this contract?
What's the story?

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:23.175
- Come and meet our friends.
- Friends? Let's go.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:26.721
- Update the file?
- Yes.

01:03:27.221 --> 01:03:31.225
Girls, I tried my best, but that
was their counter offer.

01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:35.479
He's in financial straits?
What a joke! He's gotta give us

01:03:35.563 --> 01:03:38.190
our full due to the last penny!

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:39.984
Otherwise no agreement!

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:43.112
Portofino has always
been a tourist haven.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:46.365
Look who's there!
Look where the boss is!

01:03:46.449 --> 01:03:49.118
That's financial straights? That?!

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:52.830
- Vittorio, good afternoon.
- Thank you, good afternoon.

01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:56.751
- Always so dapper!
- Happily on vacation, look!

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.753
- I dress Italian.
- Pay us, dimwit!

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:02.089
I have faith in Italian products
because

01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:05.092
I know they contain love,
care and craftsmanship.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:07.011
How nice to be free

01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:10.014
to sail the sea
and sip wine with friends.

01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:12.641
- I see one here.
- Hello everybody!

01:04:12.725 --> 01:04:15.978
- Ask a question!
- Yes, what's better on a yacht

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.147
bubbly or dry?

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.275
Well, let's say that
with bubbly there's a party.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.402
It's instant cheer. Fun.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:27.782
Dry is an "evergreen",
let's say a classic.

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:30.993
But if you ask me, Miss,
dry or bubbly, so what?

01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:34.747
What's important is you drink
with friends, like Vittorio.

01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:36.415
Cheers then!

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.167
Nicolo! Come and say hello!

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.045
Give a kiss to Uncle Vittorio.
Come on!

01:04:42.171 --> 01:04:43.547
Say hello to mama!

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:46.675
- Hello from Sampdoria!
- Liguria.

01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:49.178
Yeah, sure, whatever. Ciao Ciao!

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.309
I swear to you, I had no idea.
I swear!

01:04:55.643 --> 01:04:58.813
- What a shithead!
- Yes, he's a shithead.

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:06.946
Where's my cell? Give me my
cell, please? Where is it?

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:11.659
I'll give you a vacation!
It's over, loverboy... It's over.

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:19.208
Daniela, I'm entering a masonry.
Catch you later. Ciao!

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:30.094
- Come with me! - Eh?
- Move it, dummy, let's go!

01:05:32.221 --> 01:05:36.809
I'd like to thank my friends

01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:41.730
Vittorio Manieri and Pier Giorgio
Bollini for this opportunity.

01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:43.232
What can I say?

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.693
I'm from Apulia, so

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:49.113
next year we should meet there
'cause there's lots of great masonry.

01:05:49.238 --> 01:05:51.240
It's fine here, but I got

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:53.993
a lodge in Foggia. Great food!

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:55.619
See you in Apulia!

01:05:56.871 --> 01:05:58.372
Did I say something wrong?

01:06:03.878 --> 01:06:06.130
You can't imagine
how happy Nicolo was.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.632
Of course, with such a gift!

01:06:08.716 --> 01:06:13.971
How could you
think of such a thing?

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.764
It's a gift I wanted for him.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:19.101
- I'll fill out a check and pay.
- No, don't!

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:22.771
- Zoe, I can't accept such a thing.
- Really, don't.

01:06:22.897 --> 01:06:26.275
- I'm someone who pays his things.
- Anyhow, I didn't spend 2018 Euros.

01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:28.903
That's the cash-in date!

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:33.657
- It was from my heart!
- No, it's embarrassing, I'm embarrassed.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.160
Zoe, you're embarrassing me.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:49.256
- What the...? Zoe!
- Come on, jump in!

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:53.135
No, Zoe. Come on!
What's gotten into...?

01:06:53.302 --> 01:06:55.429
It's marvellous at night.

01:06:55.513 --> 01:06:57.264
- Zoe...
- Come on!

01:06:58.432 --> 01:07:00.559
- Hold still...
- I won't do anything.

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:01.810
Nothing, eh?

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.646
Come on! Get undressed!

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:08.192
Hold still! Whaddya want?
Who called you? Eh?

01:07:08.317 --> 01:07:10.402
Come on! Jump in!

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:14.698
If I jump in we can cook pasta
'cause the water will boil.

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:16.700
I'm waiting.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.327
Just a second.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.166
Ciao Nicolo, how are you?

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:28.546
I'm in a tent with Antonio,
my new companion.

01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:32.967
You know, sweetie, he's a trade
unionist. And he's attentive to the

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.969
needs of us working girls.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:37.930
I can't wait for you to meet him!

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:43.310
My best to your father.
Ciao sweetie!

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:58.450
But did something happen?

01:07:58.492 --> 01:08:01.579
No, Zoe, it's nothing...
I just have to go back.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.622
Anyway Checco, let me say

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:05.749
we had a fine time and

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.627
Lorenzo is smiling again.

01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:12.256
And for me too it was
lots of fun.

01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:14.341
Especially with my mother.

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:19.263
And I thank you.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.265
- Instead, I apologize, Zoe.
- For what?

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.981
Not even a quickie...

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.151
Who's gonna believe it?

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:34.486
Lorenzo, ciao pal.

01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:37.031
Remember:
No more selective mutism.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:41.243
If you feel it coming,
just talk it away! Let's go.

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.412
- Ciao Lori!
- Ciao.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:50.044
I spoke to Checco and he said we'll
meet in Venice for Ludovico's film.

01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:53.546
- He won't go to Venice.
- Would Cannes be easier?

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.550
No. For him Ludovico's film sucks.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:11.439
I can't wait for you to meet him.

01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:14.193
My best to your father!

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:20.198
- This guy's mama's new friend?
- Yes, Nicolo.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.328
- This puker?
- Nicolo!

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:27.456
Let's not judge before we
even meet him

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:29.832
the jerk! All right?

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:33.337
You will create a relationship
with this gentleman.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.464
After which, you will freely

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:40.469
decide whether to stay with mama:
Vegetables, beans and early to bed

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:43.471
videogames max 30 minutes,
good luck,

01:09:43.555 --> 01:09:47.810
or else with papa: Soccer games,
movies, popcorn

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.813
carbonated beverages
without any problems, Nicolo.

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:55.359
Remember that papa's never
been against carbon dioxide.

01:09:55.484 --> 01:09:57.361
He's a fan.

01:09:57.444 --> 01:10:03.575
So now listen up: Stop sniveling
my boy! You're a man with a spine.

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:06.120
Okay? Stop texting
mama trying to make

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:09.248
- her change her mind.
- I'm playing Ruzzle.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:12.501
You're playing, eh? Well...

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:15.963
Text mama! Say: Papa loves you.

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:19.133
Papa really cares. Go back to him!

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:21.844
You got 100 free messages.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:25.222
Send you louse! Write:

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:28.767
- Don't destroy our "nuclar" family.
- "Nuclear".

01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:33.397
You've pissed me, Nicolo!
Just write, write the message!

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.108
- You send it!
- No! You send it!

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:57.171
We had a good time together, eh?

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.548
Nicolo, papa's always there.

01:11:00.174 --> 01:11:02.301
If you need me, just call.

01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:06.930
- And always remember?
- Optimism.

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:10.684
Optimism. 'Cause only like that
will there be buckets of sunshine.

01:11:10.768 --> 01:11:15.939
Papa, it's buckets of...
sunshine. I like it!

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:18.066
Come here!

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.945
Ciao papa.

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:40.214
My darling, welcome back!

01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:46.428
- Mama, guess what they gave me!
- What?

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.475
What a shitty summer! "Where've
you been?" Walking the dog to crap!

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.560
Move it!

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:03.821
He's VAT.
Very important to Nicolo.

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.989
Take good care of him.

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:08.867
Ciao TAEG. Ciao VAT.

01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:59.793
I play this love story
of ours in slow motion.

01:12:59.877 --> 01:13:02.629
I cry and am left breathless.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.173
Where did I go wrong.

01:13:08.176 --> 01:13:10.554
I focus my thoughts to see

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.807
if I ever hurt you

01:13:15.267 --> 01:13:18.520
if I ever clipped your wings.

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:21.064
Where did I go wrong?

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:25.903
I made you iron,
I made you scrub.

01:13:25.944 --> 01:13:29.948
I mean, did I ever forbid
you to wash a load?

01:13:30.032 --> 01:13:32.200
Where did I go wrong?

01:13:33.911 --> 01:13:37.331
It was your joy to
throw out the garbage.

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:41.335
Your immense emotion to
pack the winter clothes.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:45.714
What's the sense of this setting sun

01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:49.468
if I go back home
and dinner's not ready?

01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:53.555
What good is the morning dew

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:57.351
if my undies aren't in the dresser?

01:13:57.476 --> 01:14:01.438
What good is my washing machine

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:08.737
without her pulling out the
duds and happily hanging them?

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:12.616
Maybe it was wrong
to buy you a Thermomix.

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:15.994
You were jealous, I know you babe!

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.873
Maybe you were offended
by the dishwasher

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:23.627
you with your hands
are more prodigious.

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:28.757
Maybe I was wrong to never tell you

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.760
that for me there was only one object

01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:35.263
and that was you you you.

01:15:09.381 --> 01:15:11.883
Two months later.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.641
MANIERI AND BOLDRINI
A TWO-MAN CRIME SYNDICATE

01:15:39.953 --> 01:15:41.329
I chose to meet you

01:15:41.705 --> 01:15:43.206
in the old family factor

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:45.709
because this
is where we began.

01:15:45.792 --> 01:15:49.421
A history of beauty and quality

01:15:49.463 --> 01:15:51.214
admired worldwide.

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:55.844
Our future challenge is
to return to the past,

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:58.221
but I'll need your help.

01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:08.231
I want to thank the person
who opened my eyes,

01:16:08.315 --> 01:16:11.860
and who made all
this possible: Checco.

01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:15.947
Good morning one and all.

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:27.501
Comrades

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:34.007
I've struggled for you with passion
for we must all fight injustice.

01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:38.095
I respect you both as workers
and as women inasmuch as lesser...

01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:40.263
Wait!

01:16:40.347 --> 01:16:44.768
the protections you are owed,
the "lesser" protections not you.

01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:47.354
I heartily thank you and offer

01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:52.150
my best wishes for the future.
P.S. pronounce clearly, papa!

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:56.530
Then I wanted to saying something
to a person who is there among you.

01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:03.495
She's the person I love. The person who
I'm suffering for in this period.

01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:09.042
Daniela, I'm a different man today.
I've changed a whole lot.

01:17:09.126 --> 01:17:13.421
And I'm willing to do anything
to get back with you again.

01:17:13.505 --> 01:17:15.382
Anything, even

01:17:19.261 --> 01:17:21.555
taking out the garbage at night

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:25.934
because we're equal.

01:17:26.017 --> 01:17:28.061
Daniela, I beg you.

01:17:34.067 --> 01:17:35.569
At last

01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:37.404
things could start again.

01:17:44.703 --> 01:17:46.913
With milk, the way you like it.

01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:53.420
- Uhm, I've gotta do the laundry.
- I already did it.

01:17:57.841 --> 01:18:00.177
For me, the red ones
are pretty too.

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:04.556
Yes, this fabric is beautiful.

01:18:04.598 --> 01:18:06.975
- Yes.
- Yes, it's perfect.

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:10.228
- Stupendous.
- We'll start with this one.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.317
Well?

01:18:19.988 --> 01:18:23.617
They ask if they can pay
with postdated checks.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.493
You're asking me?

01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:29.956
My first postdated
was in the days of Mao.

01:18:29.998 --> 01:18:35.629
I'm raising a Great Wall: "don't play
to the house of the players!" Okay?

01:18:53.605 --> 01:18:57.025
I was immediately alarmed
by this situation

01:18:57.108 --> 01:19:00.528
one which surely
mustn't be underestimated.

01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:03.740
And so I consulted the doctor, who

01:19:04.032 --> 01:19:08.787
will describe the psychological
condition presently afflicting Nicolo.

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:13.166
Yes, the boy's psychological profile
is quite clear and apparent.

01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:17.045
Your son is inclined to seek
refuge in realities of pure

01:19:17.128 --> 01:19:19.547
make-believe,
going so far as to invent

01:19:19.631 --> 01:19:21.007
idyllic situations

01:19:21.049 --> 01:19:23.426
that are clearly a product
of his imagination.

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:28.765
The cause can be attributed to
your present economic difficulties.

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.892
Excuse me, you're a...?

01:19:30.934 --> 01:19:33.061
Psychologist.

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:37.691
Sorry, it's a personal thing.

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:40.652
Excuse me,
but what did Nicolo write?

01:19:40.694 --> 01:19:42.821
Ah, I'll tell you right away.

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:48.201
Horseback riding and then
even received a horse as a gift.

01:19:48.285 --> 01:19:51.955
Hosted in a magnificent
seaside villa with a pool.

01:19:52.038 --> 01:19:54.207
Parties with VIPs

01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:56.835
with a menu of cocktails
and lobster.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.337
Then he went on a yacht.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.589
Then he was pulled

01:20:01.673 --> 01:20:04.426
by a motorboat while
riding a parachute.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:06.970
Then he rode a helicopter to a

01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:09.723
golf tournament which he won,

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:11.725
and the prize was champagne.

01:20:13.935 --> 01:20:15.478
Is that a vacation?!

01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:17.939
Eh, you must consider the downturn.

01:20:17.981 --> 01:20:20.483
- The what?
- The downturn.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.237
The psychologist.

01:20:24.321 --> 01:20:26.489
They know shit these people.

01:20:29.242 --> 01:20:31.119
No, no, no, wait!

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:33.371
Our vacation didn't end here.

01:20:44.716 --> 01:20:46.384
Come in come in.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.515
Poor Aunt Ritella, poo rAuntie.

01:21:01.358 --> 01:21:06.654
Eighty-nine... eighty-nine...
eighty-nine...

01:21:09.616 --> 01:21:13.620
Nicolo, when we left,
did we switch off the heater?

01:21:14.412 --> 01:21:16.623
No. Should I go switch it?

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:20.251
No, my boy, she'll be
going out first. And now?

01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:22.045
She has to remain attached

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:25.382
to that machine that monitors
her blood pressure.

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.801
- It's not easy.
- Eighty-nine...

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:30.887
Hey... what's going on?

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:34.682
Oh Auntie! How are you doing?

01:21:34.808 --> 01:21:38.686
It's me, Checco, Auntie.
Calm down, Auntie.

01:21:38.812 --> 01:21:41.523
You only have to rest now.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:46.152
There's this machine that's
constantly monitoring you.

01:21:46.194 --> 01:21:49.280
- But you gotta rest.
- Is it electric?

01:21:49.322 --> 01:21:52.700
Eh yes, Auntie, electric...
It's not like...

01:21:53.201 --> 01:21:55.787
- Pull out the plug.
- No, Auntie.

01:21:55.829 --> 01:21:58.206
- Pull the plug.
- No, it keeps you alive.

01:21:58.331 --> 01:22:00.458
- Pull the plug.
- Nooo Auntie.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:03.169
- Pull the plug.
- No, you gotta consume it!

01:22:03.211 --> 01:22:06.339
- Pull it!
- Electricity has to be consumed!

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:09.968
- The plug!
- No, Auntie, life is an inalienable gift!

01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:12.971
You have no right
to decree your end!

01:22:13.096 --> 01:22:16.224
No Auntie, I won't be your accomplice!

01:22:16.349 --> 01:22:19.727
Nooo Auntie, you gotta consume
electricity!!

01:22:19.853 --> 01:22:23.857
No Auntie, I won't unplug you!
You tell her too!

01:22:23.982 --> 01:22:26.192
- I won't unplug!
- I won't unplug!

01:22:26.234 --> 01:22:28.987
All right already!
It means I'll commit

01:22:30.864 --> 01:22:32.866
"Auntienesia".

01:22:35.869 --> 01:22:37.996
- Why's he laughing?
- Because...

01:22:50.258 --> 01:22:54.345
There was nothing on TV
that day, you know.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:58.600
The satellite dish and
Wi-Fi were on the blink.

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:02.103
Just warm beer and no ice.

01:23:03.354 --> 01:23:06.900
And now what the hell
am I gonna do?

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:11.237
She on the couch,
me looking at the clock.

01:23:11.279 --> 01:23:15.533
More of these 50 shades of Gray.

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.911
Hey, since three in the afternoon.

01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:20.497
Sorry love,
I can't put this book down.

01:23:20.538 --> 01:23:26.169
I said "Hey, you know, there's
a chapter do it with me!"

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:31.799
And among millions of spermatozoa

01:23:31.925 --> 01:23:35.929
marathon runners racing to the ovum

01:23:36.054 --> 01:23:39.140
one of them conquered the ovary.

01:23:39.182 --> 01:23:41.935
Welcome Gaia!

01:23:44.646 --> 01:23:48.525
And don't talk to me about luck

01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:52.570
or the effect of the moon!

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:55.907
Step aside Mayan prophecy

01:23:55.949 --> 01:23:59.077
this is windfall Gaia!
