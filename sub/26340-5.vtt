WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.702
Only on Fox.

00:05.906 --> 00:08.976
You know what really
grinds my gears?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.645
Cars today.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.513
What's with all the beeping?

00:12.547 --> 00:15.082
My ex-wife's car used to beep
every time you backed up.

00:15.115 --> 00:19.420
Bitch, I know I'm backing up!
I'm driving you! I'm in charge!

00:19.454 --> 00:22.923
I can't tell if you're mad
at the car or your wife.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.759
Well, a little bit of both.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.595
Well, you've been talking about
it for an hour and a half now.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.565
And he doesn't even own a car.

00:30.598 --> 00:31.932
You know, if you're gonna
sit at my table,

00:31.966 --> 00:33.701
you got to listen to my jokes.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.436
Oh, you're telling jokes?

00:35.470 --> 00:37.438
Is that what's happening here?

00:37.472 --> 00:39.940
Oh, so you don't think
I'm funny, do you now, Margaret?

00:39.974 --> 00:41.742
Well, how about this:

00:41.776 --> 00:44.211
a doctor, a priest, and
the prime minister of Morocco...

00:44.245 --> 00:47.782
Hey, quit telling bad jokes.
I need water.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.250
(gasps)

00:51.719 --> 00:52.853
Cheese and crackers!

00:52.887 --> 00:54.955
Is this tap?

00:57.758 --> 00:59.594
Why do you keep going
on those crazy hikes

00:59.627 --> 01:00.795
with Gorgeous George?

01:00.828 --> 01:02.597
I have enough self-esteem issues

01:02.630 --> 01:07.134
without Gorgeous George telling
me I look dumpy in my Umbros.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.769
Who's Gorgeous George?

01:08.803 --> 01:09.937
And if he's such a jerk,

01:09.970 --> 01:11.138
why are you calling him
gorgeous?

01:11.171 --> 01:13.274
Well, just look at him,
Margaret.

01:14.775 --> 01:19.680
He's a New York six,
but a Arizona ten.

01:21.682 --> 01:25.219
He's the activities coordinator.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.555
It's an elected position, and
it's totally gone to his head.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.491
Activities coordinator
has totally gone to his head?

01:30.525 --> 01:31.992
Yeah.

01:32.026 --> 01:34.829
(laughs)
You are new, aren't you?

01:34.862 --> 01:37.164
He is a petty, vindictive man

01:37.197 --> 01:40.000
who uses his power
against anybody he doesn't like,

01:40.034 --> 01:41.802
and he does not like us.

01:41.836 --> 01:44.672
Uh-uh.
I once scuffed his moccasin,

01:44.705 --> 01:46.507
and he installed
a vending machine

01:46.541 --> 01:48.108
right outside my room,
so every night,

01:48.142 --> 01:50.845
it's, "Cachunk! Cachunk!
Cachunk! Cachunk! Cachunk!

01:50.878 --> 01:52.647
Cachunk!"
It's-it's the soda cans.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.182
-"Cachunk!"
-I got it, Charlie.

01:55.215 --> 01:58.953
And the worst thing about him
is he's incredibly unfunny.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.521
Tennis, anyone?

02:00.555 --> 02:03.190
(women laugh)

02:03.223 --> 02:04.825
That wasn't even funny.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.160
Now, what he should've said is,

02:06.193 --> 02:09.029
"Who's over here
making all that racket?"

02:09.063 --> 02:10.865
See, then he shows them
the racket.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.800
Now-now that's a joke.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.802
Well, well.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.203
Let me just take a peek

02:16.236 --> 02:19.273
under the lid of this
trash can over here.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.642
Ah, yeah, just as I thought:

02:21.676 --> 02:24.845
four of the biggest losers
I've ever seen.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.547
You don't even know me.

02:26.581 --> 02:29.650
Oh, Amanda, don't I?

02:29.684 --> 02:31.185
My name is Margaret.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.320
Very well, I don't know you.

02:34.889 --> 02:37.725
But if you're associating
with these losers,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.827
you're a loser, too.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.062
Yeah, well,
you might have me there.

02:42.096 --> 02:45.232
Why, Sidney, I'm surprised

02:45.265 --> 02:49.336
you're not icing your
ham-like thighs right now.

02:49.370 --> 02:53.173
The sound of them chafing this
morning scared the birds away.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.209
Man, get the hell out of here.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.745
Go tell somebody else
some corny-ass jokes,

02:57.778 --> 03:00.581
-and that's "jokes" in quotes.
-Mm.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.683
I just wanted
to remind you degenerates

03:02.717 --> 03:05.753
about the activities coordinator
election this Friday.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.855
I urge you to do

03:07.888 --> 03:09.924
what every lady's done in this
complex at one time or another

03:09.957 --> 03:12.627
and "Say yes to George."

03:14.695 --> 03:18.098
Toodle-oo, trash.

03:18.132 --> 03:21.836
Bye, George, have a nice day.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.939
You know what we need to do
about Gorgeous George?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.741
Yeah, drag his ass
out in the desert,

03:26.774 --> 03:28.108
tie his ass to a cactus,

03:28.142 --> 03:31.746
and let the vultures
eat him bite by bite.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.947
No, no, no.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.281
One of us needs to run
for activities coordinator

03:34.314 --> 03:35.883
and beat him.

03:35.916 --> 03:40.254
Well, okay, but my way
would be a lot more fun.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.258
*

04:04.244 --> 04:05.980
I really think
we can do this, guys.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.247
If we could beat George,

04:07.281 --> 04:09.249
Sid, you'll never have
to go on a hike again,

04:09.283 --> 04:11.752
Charlie would finally
have some peace and quiet,

04:11.786 --> 04:13.087
and Hank... Hank...

04:13.120 --> 04:15.656
What is your problem
with him again?

04:15.690 --> 04:17.658
The man's a criminal.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.795
He steals laughs
when he doesn't deserve them.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.998
Well, he has been running
unopposed for ten years.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.000
He's complacent,
and we're hungry.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.902
I think we really have a chance
to beat George.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.671
Slow your roll there, rookie.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.340
Now, the way I see it,
this guy's gotten complacent,

04:33.373 --> 04:34.909
but we're hungry.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.177
I think we have a chance
to beat this George.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.946
That's what I just said.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.448
Listen to him, Margaret,
he's onto something.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.183
I don't have to listen to him.

04:43.217 --> 04:47.287
I will think about all the stuff
I just said a minute ago.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.089
Now, who's running?

04:49.123 --> 04:52.860
So you don't know everything.
It's obviously Charlie.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.796
There are some very premium nuts
in this mix.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.365
Charlie, really?

04:58.398 --> 05:00.367
Yeah, you're a woman,
I'm black, he's gay.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.170
We're trying to win an election
in a retirement community,

05:03.203 --> 05:05.172
we're not putting together
a college brochure.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.174
Charlie's our man.

05:07.207 --> 05:10.377
Well, I accept, and I think
if we can focus on the issues--

05:10.410 --> 05:13.948
Hey-oh! Pistachio!

05:13.981 --> 05:17.351
All right, well, if Nut Boy
is going to be our candidate,

05:17.384 --> 05:19.186
we're gonna have to run
a negative campaign.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.288
We need to dig up
some dirt on George.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.223
Really? Why can't we
just have a fun mascot

05:23.257 --> 05:24.992
like that Geico gecko?

05:25.025 --> 05:26.961
(laughing):
He makes me laugh.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.129
Or-or an Activities Lizard

05:29.163 --> 05:33.200
who eats bullies
and sings sometimes.

05:33.233 --> 05:36.403
Lizards don't eat people.
They blow flames at 'em.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.905
That's dragons.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.506
Lizards can be dragons.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.507
What about Komodos?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.743
Well, as your candidate...

05:42.777 --> 05:44.779
What about Komodos, Margaret?

05:45.880 --> 05:47.414
What...
What is this?

05:47.447 --> 05:50.417
Why are you people in my office?

05:50.450 --> 05:53.153
We're taking advantage
of your open door policy.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.389
I don't have
an open door policy.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.992
You know, I think we're trying
to say the same thing.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.427
We're here to register Charlie

06:00.460 --> 06:02.930
as an official candidate
for activities coordinator.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.198
ALLISON:
Yeah...

06:04.231 --> 06:07.401
That's not a thing
you need to do.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.771
So do you decree that he is
a official candidate?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.773
You just show up
to the town hall on Friday.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.441
You don't need a decree.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.877
-Uhp! I heard a decree.
-I heard her, too.

06:16.911 --> 06:19.379
-Nice work, Hank.
-Okay.

06:19.413 --> 06:23.250
Now, can we please go dig up
some dirt on George?

06:23.283 --> 06:25.185
Margaret, write this down.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.788
Elections are not won
with dirt and negativity.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.457
They are won
with charm and charisma

06:30.490 --> 06:32.893
and, most importantly, jokes.

06:32.927 --> 06:36.063
Comedy, that's the weak spot
for Gorgeous George.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.800
Yeah, more like
"Bore-geous... Bore-ge."

06:39.834 --> 06:41.535
No, see, that's why
I'm gonna be writing the jokes

06:41.568 --> 06:42.536
from here on out.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.172
You missed
"Bore-geous Snore-ge."

06:47.341 --> 06:49.176
That's how you win an election.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.381
*

06:54.414 --> 06:56.416
All right, let's get out there
and charm some voters.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.452
-Okay.
-Listen up,
you may learn something.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.287
Well, at least he looks great.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.323
Sid, you're a regular
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.325
I did my best.

07:05.359 --> 07:09.096
His entire closet is filled with
free T-shirts from the bank.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.832
-All right, so get in there...
-Yeah.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.000
-uh, don't be weird...
-No.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.169
...be charming, and hit 'em
with that great joke,

07:15.202 --> 07:16.837
-and get the hell out.
-Okay.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.338
-(chuckles)
-Walk in the park.

07:18.372 --> 07:22.109
I feel like I'm watching
the Titanic leaving the dock.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.345
Not everybody died
on that ship, Margaret.

07:25.379 --> 07:28.148
Hi. I'm Charlie.

07:28.182 --> 07:31.585
I'm not weird; I'm charming.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.921
Here's a personal story.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.057
In 1998, I was abducted
by little green aliens.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.960
I'm new to politics.

07:39.994 --> 07:42.196
How do you feel this is going?

07:42.229 --> 07:46.901
And I was so surprised to find
that they call it "outercourse."

07:49.503 --> 07:53.007
Wow, I did not think
it would go that well.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.676
Charlie,
you diarrhea'd the pool.

07:57.211 --> 08:01.115
You diarrhea'd the pool
with everybody in it.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.050
You're out,
and so are you, Hank.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.885
I'm in charge now.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.553
Wait a minute,
what you mean you in charge?

08:06.586 --> 08:09.656
Your candidate just described
being anally probed

08:09.690 --> 08:14.561
by aliens as
"a great learning experience."

08:15.595 --> 08:19.366
I said "annually probed."

08:19.399 --> 08:21.335
Although both are true.

08:21.368 --> 08:24.404
You better stop
talking smack, Margaret,

08:24.438 --> 08:26.540
and get on the Charlie train.
He's your candidate, too.

08:26.573 --> 08:30.077
Not anymore. I'm running Sid,
and we're gonna kick your ass.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.379
What? Moi?

08:32.412 --> 08:33.680
Yes, "you-ah."

08:33.714 --> 08:35.482
He's cute. He's funny.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.084
Everybody loves him.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.418
He's our best chance
of taking down George

08:38.452 --> 08:40.587
and you. Let's go, Sid.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.589
Wait, where's your spine, Sid?

08:42.622 --> 08:44.424
You gonna do everything
this woman tells you to?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.593
-Well, no.
-Let's go, Sid.

08:46.626 --> 08:47.694
Oh, you guys keep in touch.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.603
All right,
we have got a lot of work to do

08:56.636 --> 08:58.238
if we're gonna win this election

08:58.272 --> 09:01.508
and prove that I am much,
much smarter than Hank.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.112
First off, I'd like to say
it's an honor to be tapped,

09:05.145 --> 09:07.381
but I'm not sure
I'm ready for this.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.616
The only thing I've ever run for

09:09.649 --> 09:11.986
was my life
at a Kid Rock concert.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.622
Aren't you tired
of being a doormat?

09:15.655 --> 09:17.624
Aren't you sick
of going on those hikes?

09:17.657 --> 09:18.959
Well, yes.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.460
Well, then, you got to get mean.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.029
Oh, I don't do mean.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.464
Let's just do
my lizard mascot idea.

09:24.498 --> 09:26.466
Give him a catchy slogan.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.735
Uh, like, "Vote for Sid."

09:28.769 --> 09:30.771
(hissing):
Sss-sid.

09:33.340 --> 09:37.377
Okay, see, that, uh,
that's a snake, not a lizard.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.713
But at this point
I'm just gonna go ahead

09:39.746 --> 09:42.416
and embrace
that reptile fixation.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.218
So if you want to be a lizard,

09:44.251 --> 09:45.319
you're gonna have to be
a mean lizard.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.121
But I want to be a fun,

09:47.154 --> 09:49.156
singing lizard, like Kermit.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.125
Kermit is a frog.

09:51.158 --> 09:54.761
I am not a zoologist, Margaret.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.664
This is politics, kiddo.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.599
Come on.
You got to get nasty.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.268
Say something mean about George.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.769
Okay, well, here goes.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.604
Uh, and I feel awful
saying this,

10:04.638 --> 10:08.475
but sometimes he just takes
way too long at the salad bar.

10:08.508 --> 10:11.078
That's not mean enough.
You need to get angry.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.246
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.780
I'm gonna be George, okay?

10:13.814 --> 10:15.315
(mimics George):
Well, well, well, Sidney.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.651
Looking a little mushy
around the middle,

10:17.684 --> 10:20.354
-aren't we, Sidney?
-Well, that's not very nice.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.289
What are you gonna do about it,
thunder thighs?

10:22.322 --> 10:25.125
-Stop hitting yourself, Sidney.
-(groans)

10:25.159 --> 10:26.660
Th-Th-That's enough, George!

10:26.693 --> 10:28.795
You're mean and you're a bully,
and sometimes when we go

10:28.829 --> 10:32.032
on those hikes I just want
to push you off a cliff.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.201
(normal voice):
That's what I'm looking for.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.203
Oh, that felt great.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.604
But what am I becoming?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.539
A viable candidate.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.043
All right, now we got to get
this joke right.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.478
-Okay.
-I made a poster for you.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.647
Shabam!
(laughs)

10:47.681 --> 10:50.217
Wow, who the hell is that?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.485
It's you, man.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.154
Oh, I thought it was Braveheart.
(chuckles)

10:54.188 --> 10:56.556
-Aw, for-- forget the poster.
-Okay.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.658
Now, I'm gonna show you
how this joke can kill.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.660
Okay, a doctor, a priest,

11:00.694 --> 11:02.729
the prime minister of Morocco
walk into a bar.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.731
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there. (chuckles)

11:04.764 --> 11:08.735
Morocco is
a constitutional monarchy.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.571
I'm gonna pound your head
into dust

11:11.605 --> 11:14.708
if you keep ruining
my damn joke.

11:14.741 --> 11:18.245
All right, I want you to sit
here, listen, and watch.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.746
And don't say nothing.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.848
Punam, come here!

11:21.882 --> 11:23.817
Is this about your lemonade?

11:23.850 --> 11:26.620
(sighs) Sorry, but we're just
slammed right now.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.661
Yeah, uh, I just want you
to listen to this joke.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.432
Oh, fun.
I'll be an easy laugh, too.

11:38.465 --> 11:42.302
I did mushrooms last night and
they haven't fully worn off yet.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.109
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

11:49.143 --> 11:51.745
All right. A doctor... a priest,

11:51.778 --> 11:54.881
and the prime minister
of Morocco walk into a bar...

11:54.915 --> 11:57.117
(laughs)

11:57.151 --> 11:58.885
That's hilarious.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.421
Ugh, I did not see that coming.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.623
I never said the punch line.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.592
Oh, well, that's your mistake

12:05.625 --> 12:08.462
because the punch line's
the funniest part of a joke.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.665
(yells nonsensically)

12:13.833 --> 12:16.803
*

12:16.836 --> 12:18.905
We are making you
a good luck lasagna

12:18.939 --> 12:20.407
for the election, Georgie.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.408
Ooh.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.243
With extra cheese.

12:23.277 --> 12:24.878
Extra cheese?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.546
Yes, please.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.582
Now, don't forget...

12:28.615 --> 12:30.884
say yes to George.

12:30.917 --> 12:36.356
Actually, do forget to say yes
to George, because George sucks.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.726
Good start. Get meaner.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.262
Well, well, well,

12:42.296 --> 12:46.633
if it isn't Snow White and her
one dwarf, Chafey.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.570
You know, I heard a little rumor
that the freak show party

12:50.604 --> 12:52.672
is mounting a run against me.

12:52.706 --> 12:55.809
Oh, really? Well, I heard
a little rumor myself.

12:55.842 --> 13:01.515
It'd be a shame if your voters
knew that you had calf implants.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.318
Outrageous.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.320
These are natural calves.

13:06.353 --> 13:10.424
Perfectly sculpted from years
of tiptoeing out of bedrooms.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.592
-Ladies' bedrooms.
-(chuckles)

13:12.626 --> 13:13.960
More like tiptoeing out

13:13.994 --> 13:16.330
of the Tucson Center
for Leg Enhancements.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.366
Dr. Kapnakian says hello.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.702
Larry Kapnakian is a liar!

13:23.870 --> 13:26.206
I'll see you
at the town hall tonight.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.807
(scoffs)

13:27.841 --> 13:29.943
Oh, that felt great.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.211
I don't want to stop.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.546
Don't stop. Keep going.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.548
Well, uh, what have we here?

13:34.581 --> 13:37.351
Is this a painting
of dogs playing poker?

13:38.818 --> 13:43.390
Sid, what are you doing?

13:43.423 --> 13:45.959
You smear George,
not the voters.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.661
Well, before you correct me,
Margaret,

13:47.694 --> 13:49.663
perhaps you should correct
that ugly sweater.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.731
Just because it was
on the sale rack

13:51.765 --> 13:54.734
doesn't mean you have to buy it.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.873
This is my favorite sweater,
and I paid full retail.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.575
Where, at the gas station?

14:01.608 --> 14:03.577
Ooh.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.245
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's right.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.847
The lizard is out of his shell
and he's snapping.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.550
That's turtles.

14:10.584 --> 14:12.252
Margaret,
how are you still single

14:12.286 --> 14:13.587
with such a treasure trove

14:13.620 --> 14:16.523
of animal facts
at your disposal?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.925
Vote for Sss-sid.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.295
Vote for Sid.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.300
Hey, old man, here's a headline.
Vote for Sss-sid.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.938
We are not voting for him.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.374
Yeah, Grace, I know.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.779
Do you guys like this sweater?

14:47.487 --> 14:48.955
Oh, and another thing, Leon.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.924
You know that little tile room
with the nozzle in it?

14:50.957 --> 14:52.959
It's called a shower.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.995
Why not give it
a whirl sometime?

14:57.497 --> 14:58.698
Sid.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.700
-Sid, come in here.
-What?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.703
What the hell
are you doing in here?

15:03.737 --> 15:05.805
I am hiding from Hank.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.974
He's been yelling at me all day,

15:08.007 --> 15:11.478
and the smell of bleach
really centers me.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.979
That's 'cause your mama
was a janitor.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.814
And your mama's mama
was a janitor.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.951
Sid, what has gotten into you?

15:17.984 --> 15:19.653
You know damn well
that my mother

15:19.686 --> 15:21.488
was a state senator by day

15:21.521 --> 15:24.491
and a high-end prostitute
by night.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.960
Margaret has got me
all riled up.

15:26.993 --> 15:30.063
I mean, I ripped off
a woman's wig today.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.932
At least I thought it was a wig
till she screamed.

15:32.966 --> 15:37.103
Hank and Margaret have turned us
into the exact things we hate.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.506
You're a bully, and I'm telling

15:39.539 --> 15:41.841
culturally inaccurate jokes.

15:41.875 --> 15:45.345
Let's team up and do it our way.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.580
Yes.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.348
I love the lizard idea,
by the way.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.749
Well, thank you, Charlie.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.985
-And I love your suit.
-Well...

15:52.018 --> 15:53.687
(laughing):
Well, you picked it out.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.690
(laughing):
Oh, well, it makes sense then.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.693
I see what you're saying
about the bleach.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.529
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.063
Hmm.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.833
Hmm.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.669
So you ready for this town hall?

16:09.703 --> 16:11.538
-Yeah, as a matter of fact.
-I don't care.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.374
My boy Charlie has got this
in the bag.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.042
And, Margaret, you will see

16:16.075 --> 16:18.144
that when a joke
is perfectly told,

16:18.178 --> 16:19.946
it can really move a crowd.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.015
You are delusional if you think

16:22.048 --> 16:25.885
Mr. Alien Outercourse
is gonna win anything.

16:25.919 --> 16:29.389
Well, I heard
your candidate bit a woman.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.726
Well, he might be a little bit
unpolished, but...

16:32.759 --> 16:36.396
he's a killer, and he is gonna
crush Charlie and George.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.565
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about George.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.833
Oh, really. Why is that?

16:39.866 --> 16:42.702
One word: lasagna, baby!

16:42.736 --> 16:45.138
That's two words, ding-dong.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.641
And I'm gonna need
a few more of 'em.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.976
Well, one of George's groupies
made him a lasagna,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.745
left it outside his door,

16:51.778 --> 16:53.547
and I, uh,
put a little secret ingredient

16:53.580 --> 16:55.048
I bought from Punam in it.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.750
Mushrooms.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.852
Magic mushrooms.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.522
So you're going dirty
like I said we should have

17:02.556 --> 17:04.090
in the first place, right?

17:04.123 --> 17:06.159
Well, let's not get caught
all up in the whos and the hows.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.095
The point is,
George is gonna be so high,

17:09.128 --> 17:10.897
he's never gonna get through
that speech,

17:10.930 --> 17:13.433
and that's gonna give Charlie
all the runway he needs

17:13.467 --> 17:15.735
to crush that joke, baby.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.437
You call me "baby"
one more time,

17:17.471 --> 17:19.806
I'm gonna crush more
than your joke.

17:21.140 --> 17:25.679
And Charlie is gonna have
one big little problem-- Sid.

17:25.712 --> 17:30.950
Well, Sid's gonna have one big
normal-sized problem-- Charlie.

17:30.984 --> 17:33.487
We found a hallway lasagna.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.557
Y'all have to try it.

17:37.591 --> 17:41.961
It's like a cheesy blanket
I wear on the inside.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.964
We're gonna beat George
without you.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.633
This is so damn good.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.969
It's like a cheesy blanket
I wear on the inside.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.805
SID:
I like it so much,

17:51.838 --> 17:55.174
it's like a cheesy blanket
I wear on the inside.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.845
Damn, damn, damn!

18:05.519 --> 18:06.886
Well, we're screwed.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.255
Your candidate is off
somewhere shrooming,

18:09.289 --> 18:12.225
and mine is talking
to a damn plant.

18:12.258 --> 18:16.262
Ma'am, ma'am, with all due
respect, that's your opinion.

18:16.296 --> 18:19.132
You might be screwed,
but I'm not.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.834
Well, why are you screwed
and I'm not?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.168
And why are you smiling
like that?

18:22.201 --> 18:23.970
Because I took care
of everything.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.839
After you drugged both
of our candidates,

18:25.872 --> 18:27.641
I had to do something.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.175
But it was a foolproof plan!

18:29.208 --> 18:32.011
Who eats found lasagna?

18:32.045 --> 18:34.180
I knew George would want
a little pre-speech workout,

18:34.213 --> 18:35.949
so I followed him downstairs

18:35.982 --> 18:38.251
and I locked him
in the fitness center.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.286
So no George?
I mean, I don't understand.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.021
So there are no candidates now?

18:42.055 --> 18:43.757
Oh, there's one...

18:43.790 --> 18:45.024
-baby.
-Oh...

18:46.059 --> 18:48.094
Hi, everyone. Hello.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.696
My name is Margaret.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.931
I'm running
for activities coordinator.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.633
I have been told that,
as a woman,

18:53.667 --> 18:56.169
I can't possibly win,
but screw that.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.806
I've been told many things
by men.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.676
Stupid, bald, unfunny men.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.911
Bald? I got a ring.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.881
I'm in the middle
of my speech here.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.216
Shoot, I'm in the middle
of mine. I'm running, too.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.118
Hey, y'all, how you doing?

19:12.151 --> 19:15.889
Folks,
what's going on with cars?

19:15.922 --> 19:17.591
Why are they always beeping?

19:21.227 --> 19:22.696
Nothing?

19:22.729 --> 19:25.832
Well, it's time
to bring out the big gun.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.734
A doctor, a priest,

19:27.767 --> 19:31.070
and the, uh, prime minister of
Morocco walk into a bar, and...

19:31.104 --> 19:32.872
Excuse me.

19:32.906 --> 19:36.610
Great news. We're engaged.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.212
Saboteur!

19:40.346 --> 19:42.582
She locked me in the gymnasium!

19:42.616 --> 19:44.851
These freaks are trying
to rig this election.

19:44.884 --> 19:49.222
Freaks? You've got double-D
calves and lasagna groupies.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.259
Compared to you, we are normal.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.929
(roaring)

19:55.962 --> 19:57.997
Roar!

19:58.031 --> 19:59.933
I am the Activities Lizard!

19:59.966 --> 20:03.903
Vote for me, and I won't scratch
your eyeballs out.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.607
Still think you're not freaks?

20:07.641 --> 20:10.877
Maybe you should ask
your friend, this baby dragon.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.747
I'm not a baby dragon.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.749
I am an adult lizard,

20:15.782 --> 20:17.917
and I'm tired
of taking your crap, George!

20:17.951 --> 20:19.786
-Oh!
-(all gasping)

20:21.087 --> 20:25.191
So... obviously
the election is canceled.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.192
(overlapping chatter)

20:26.225 --> 20:28.127
Why?

20:28.161 --> 20:30.229
Punam is
the new activities coordinator

20:30.263 --> 20:32.966
because she would much rather do
that job for free

20:32.999 --> 20:36.803
than get fired for giving drugs
to the residents.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.905
In my defense,
I was not giving them.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.940
I was selling them.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.112
George ruptured his calf
implants when Sid tackled him.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.948
And he's filed a restraining
order against the four of you.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.751
Wait, that means he can't come
anywhere near us either?

20:51.785 --> 20:55.121
He won't bully me anymore!
I'm free.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.790
Yeah, me, too.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.658
Good-bye, cachunks.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.259
Cachunks are the sodas...

21:01.928 --> 21:04.330
Well, Hank,
it kind of looks like I won.

21:04.363 --> 21:05.965
Wrong. We both won.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.967
We played dirty
just like I suggested,

21:08.001 --> 21:09.836
and everything worked out.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.271
One more thing before we go.
(clears throat)

21:12.305 --> 21:15.341
A doctor, a priest, and
the prime minister of Morocco...

21:15.374 --> 21:16.776
Get out of my office.

21:16.810 --> 21:18.812
I never get
to say the punch line.

21:18.845 --> 21:22.448
They walk into a bar,
and the bartender says,

21:22.482 --> 21:23.883
"What is this, a joke?"

21:26.219 --> 21:27.821
That's comedy there.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.758
"What is this, a joke?"
