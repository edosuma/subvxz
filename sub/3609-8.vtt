00:02.003 --> 00:03.789
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:11.220 --> 00:14.132
Camp's right over there.
Can you get me some clothes?

00:14.223 --> 00:17.681
- What happened to yours?
- I woke up in the jungle like this.

00:17.768 --> 00:21.761
Oh, FYI, the whole island vibrated.

00:21.856 --> 00:25.348
Kate, Jack and Sawyer saw it
before they had bags over their heads.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.104
Don't worry.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.982
Locke's gonna go after them.
He said so in his speech.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.778
What speech?

00:32.491 --> 00:34.743
[Locke] I'm gonna find our friends.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.818
We're gonna find them. All of them.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.873
I don't know how yet, but I will.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.626
You've, um...
You've got a problem with your roof.

00:46.756 --> 00:47.745
Roof?

00:54.096 --> 00:57.133
- [Claire shrieks]
- [Aaron crying]

01:13.115 --> 01:15.777
Dude, I don't know about this.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.405
See, you're looking at this all wrong.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.111
He would want us to do this.

01:20.206 --> 01:23.494
He'd want us to ransack
his tent and take his stash?

01:23.584 --> 01:26.917
- That sounds exactly like Sawyer.
- He stole it in the first place.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.622
People need food.
They need medical supplies. They need...

01:31.842 --> 01:34.333
...shocking amounts of pornography.

01:34.971 --> 01:37.178
- Charlie.
- Oh...

01:37.265 --> 01:39.256
Desmondo.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.807
- I need you to come with me.
- You guys find Eko?

01:42.979 --> 01:44.844
Both of you.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.579
What happened?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.836
Eko is dead.

02:15.886 --> 02:20.004
We found his body in the jungle.
We buried him yesterday.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.173
HOW did he die?

02:24.687 --> 02:26.302
The island killed him.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.730
What do you mean,
"The island killed him"?

02:31.485 --> 02:34.022
What do you mean,
"The island killed him"?

02:34.113 --> 02:36.354
[Locke] You know what it means.

02:36.449 --> 02:38.861
With the doctor gone,
the camp's on edge enough

02:38.951 --> 02:42.284
without people worrying
about what's out there in the jungle.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.987
They're gonna look to you two
to see how to react.

02:45.082 --> 02:49.576
So when | tell everyone what happened,
I need you to help keep things calm.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.373
Dude, are you OK?

02:54.258 --> 02:57.250
Hey, guys...
what's wrong with Desmond?

03:18.741 --> 03:19.821
What is he doing?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.948
There's someone else out there.

03:34.799 --> 03:37.415
- Where's Claire?
- She just went for a walk.

03:37.510 --> 03:38.966
I offered to watch the baby.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.306
Claire!

03:55.111 --> 03:57.022
- I've got her.
- Is she OK?

03:58.072 --> 03:59.983
Claire! What happened?

04:00.074 --> 04:02.110
Stand back! Just give me some room!

04:02.785 --> 04:05.117
- Claire.
- Charlie, I know what I'm doing!

04:05.413 --> 04:07.995
Is she breathing?
She's not breathing?

04:14.505 --> 04:16.416
Come on.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.997
Do you want me to help you?

04:18.884 --> 04:21.136
- Come on.
- Claire!

04:21.887 --> 04:23.138
Claire.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.339
You all right?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.133
Come on, you're alright.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.852
- Charlie's here!
- It's all right, Charlie.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.147
- Let's get her back to her tent.
- Is she OK? Let me help!

04:35.234 --> 04:37.850
- I'll take her...
- I've got her, Charlie.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.692
Where are you going?
Hey, how did you know?

04:44.201 --> 04:46.863
How did you know she was drowning?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.741
I'll tell you how he knew.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.206
That guy...

04:54.086 --> 04:55.701
...sees the future, dude.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.164
She's beautiful.

05:35.794 --> 05:40.003
Aye. Thanks.

05:40.090 --> 05:43.002
- What's her name?
- Penny.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.584
Penelope.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.928
- How're you feeling?
- Still a little shaken up.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.264
| go swimming almost every day, and...

05:56.524 --> 05:58.856
the undertowjust grabbed me.
I mean, if...

05:58.943 --> 06:00.558
...you know, if you hadn't...

06:00.653 --> 06:03.235
- [Charlie] Claire?
- [Aaron crying]

06:03.322 --> 06:06.314
You were only gonna be five minutes.
Aaron's starving.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.740
Yeah, um... I'm sorry.

06:13.374 --> 06:17.333
Anyway, ljust really
wanted to say thank you.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.044
Thank you so much...

06:21.131 --> 06:23.713
...for being there.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.213
lt's... It's my pleasure.

06:32.017 --> 06:35.930
Locke doesn't know about anything
except knives and fishing.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.479
There's nothing to know.
I don't buy this precognitive rubbish.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.980
If the Bearded Wonder predicts
the future, he wouldn't be here.

06:45.030 --> 06:49.069
Well, whatever happened to him,
we're gonna have to find out what it is.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.617
You realize he's gonna know your plan
before you come up with it.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.320
In that case...

06:55.541 --> 06:57.827
...we'll have to get him bloody drunk.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.804
Beautiful evening.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.465
Aye.

07:17.313 --> 07:18.849
Say it, dude.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.436
This morning...

07:23.527 --> 07:26.064
...l'm sorry I wasn't more grateful.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.940
Thank you for helping Claire not drown.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.073
- No harm done.
- Excellent.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.618
I brought a peace offering.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.451
You know, make the truce official.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.002
Thanks, but no.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.172
I've spent a wee bit
too much time drunk as of late.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.677
Too good for us, brother?

07:53.974 --> 07:58.809
Alright. That's fine. We'll take our
drink and go somewhere else.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.889
- What kind of whiskey is that?
- It's, uh... Itjust says MacCutcheon.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.064
[chuckling]

08:16.455 --> 08:19.242
Alright, then. Let's have it.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.333
No, the bottle, brother.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.502
If you've come to drink, let's drink.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.874
Hey, let's drink.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.554
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.353
[all] I She swore like a docker

08:43.440 --> 08:45.931
J‘ With a cracking set of knockers

08:46.026 --> 08:52.022
J‘ She was only the farmer's daughter!

08:52.116 --> 08:57.611
[all whooping, laughing]

08:59.832 --> 09:01.618
- Dezzie...
- Cheers.

09:02.126 --> 09:05.744
Hey, are all your songs about drinking

09:05.838 --> 09:08.170
and fighting and girls with one leg?

09:08.257 --> 09:11.624
Well... girls with one leg
and a heart of gold.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.143
So, Dezzie...

09:24.440 --> 09:27.182
- ...let me ask you something.
- Anything, pal.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.980
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

09:34.616 --> 09:37.358
I could hear her calling for help.

09:37.453 --> 09:41.071
Oh, no, you didn't.
We were, like, a mile away.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.498
Well, I suppose...

09:46.712 --> 09:48.748
...l've got good hearing.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.583
You, uh...

09:54.678 --> 09:56.669
...hear the lightning as well?

09:57.806 --> 09:58.886
Excuse me?

10:00.142 --> 10:02.133
The lightning.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.685
Just by chance, you pitched
your little rod outside Claire's tent.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.640
Two hours later, the lightning strikes.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.992
Thanks for the drink, pal.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.326
Hey, I don't know what you're doing,
but you best tell us!

10:26.710 --> 10:29.452
Because you turned some key,
that makes you a hero?

10:29.546 --> 10:31.252
You're no hero, brother.

10:31.340 --> 10:35.834
I don't know how you're doing it,
but I know a coward when I see one!

10:35.928 --> 10:37.213
Yeah!

10:38.263 --> 10:41.005
You don't know what happened
when I turned that key!

10:41.099 --> 10:43.806
- You don't want to know!
- Dude!

10:43.894 --> 10:47.057
- Get him off me!
- You don't want to know!

10:47.147 --> 10:49.354
[alarm blaring]

10:51.610 --> 10:55.068
- [rumbling]
- System failure... System failure...

11:00.577 --> 11:03.193
- Desmond!
- I'll see ya in another life, brother.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.889
I love you, Penny.

11:38.866 --> 11:42.529
[woman] Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.244
Des! Are you all right?

11:47.624 --> 11:50.707
Stay there, hang on.
I'm just getting ice.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.674
Are you alright?

11:58.802 --> 12:00.588
- You OK?
- What's happening?

12:00.679 --> 12:03.421
What's happening is the result
of combining ladders,

12:03.515 --> 12:07.349
painting the ceiling, and alcohol.
Are you OK? Are you nauseous?

12:10.105 --> 12:12.391
- This is my flat.
- Mm-hmm.

12:12.482 --> 12:16.395
If you want me to feel at home here,
you might start calling it "our" flat.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.740
How many fingers, Des?

12:22.993 --> 12:25.985
Love, look at me. What's wrong?

12:35.213 --> 12:37.169
Absolutely nothing.

12:47.267 --> 12:47.301
[music playing over radio]

12:47.309 --> 12:49.300
[music playing over radio]

13:04.576 --> 13:06.817
Here... let me.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.787
- Thanks.
- Oh, hang on.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.702
- You've got paint on your neck.
- Really?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.337
How's that concussion?

13:19.633 --> 13:22.966
Well, my... severe head injury
is a small price to pay

13:23.053 --> 13:27.387
for the pleasure of having you
move into my humble...

13:28.558 --> 13:31.721
- ...is "rat trap" accurate?
- Uh-uh.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.394
Voila.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.320
You know you don't really need
a job from my father, Des.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.322
It's not about the job.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.997
- I want him to respect me.
- Then respect you he shall.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.993
But if he's too daft
to see how brilliant you are,

13:57.087 --> 13:59.499
it's not the end of the world.

14:00.924 --> 14:04.758
- What did you say?
- [beeping]

14:20.610 --> 14:21.770
Here you go, love.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.316
- You alright?
- Yeah.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.943
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a...

14:28.368 --> 14:31.201
...just had a bit of a deja vu,
that's all.

14:42.674 --> 14:46.132
Good afternoon,
I'm here to see Mr. Widmore.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.633
- And you are?
- Hume. Mr. Desmond Hume.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.972
[man] Hello, love.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.390
Got a parcel here for 815.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.973
Excuse me, what did you say?

15:01.735 --> 15:05.603
I said delivery for 815.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.820
[woman] Mr. Hume,

15:10.911 --> 15:12.742
Mr. Widmore is ready for you.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.284
Thank you.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.048
Penny didn't tell me
you were an actor, Desmond.

15:27.135 --> 15:31.378
Oh, no, it was actually set design
for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

15:31.473 --> 15:35.307
Impressive. You didn't
graduate from university?

15:35.393 --> 15:38.931
No, sir. I had to look after
my three brothers after my father...

15:39.022 --> 15:40.603
Any military experience?

15:43.401 --> 15:44.732
No, sir.

15:48.698 --> 15:49.983
She's beautiful...

15:51.451 --> 15:52.691
...your boat.

15:53.537 --> 15:56.825
My foundation is sponsoring
a solo race around the world.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.962
- Something wrong?
- No.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.629
No, sir.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.633
Desmond, I'll see to it
that you have a position

16:10.720 --> 16:12.972
in our administrative department.

16:13.056 --> 16:16.594
Not the most glamorous duty,
but it's a start.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.142
I'll speak to human resources...

16:19.229 --> 16:21.185
With all due respect, sir...

16:22.566 --> 16:27.060
...I haven't come here to interview
for a position in your company.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.769
- You haven't?
- No, sir.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.943
I came here to ask for
your daughter's hand in marriage.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.493
We've been together
two years now and...

16:42.043 --> 16:43.954
Pen's moving in...

16:44.045 --> 16:47.173
...and I love her.

16:50.302 --> 16:53.135
Your permission would mean
everything to me.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.431
I'm impressed, Hume.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.346
A very noble gesture.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.891
- You know anything about whiskey?
- No, I'm afraid not, sir.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.232
This is a 60-year MacCutcheon.

17:11.323 --> 17:15.737
Named after Anderson MacCutcheon.
Esteemed Admiral from the Royal Navy.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.450
He retired...

17:18.747 --> 17:21.830
with more medals
than any man before or since.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.450
Moved to the Highlands
to see out his remaining years.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.877
Admiral MacCutcheon
was a great man, Hume.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.335
This was his crowning achievement.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.798
This swallow...

17:39.893 --> 17:42.475
...is worth more than
you could make in a month.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.441
To share it with you
would be a waste,

17:53.531 --> 17:56.318
and a disgrace to the great man
who made it.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.279
Because you, Hume,

17:59.371 --> 18:01.657
will never be a great man.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.627
Mr. Widmore...

18:11.841 --> 18:14.002
- ...I know I'm not...
- What you're not...

18:14.761 --> 18:16.922
...is worthy of drinking my whiskey.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.173
How could you ever
be worthy of my daughter?

18:42.998 --> 18:45.455
[guitar playing]

18:47.127 --> 18:51.086
[man singing] J‘ And maybe

18:51.172 --> 18:54.414
J‘ You're gonna be
the one that saves me

18:56.428 --> 18:59.465
J‘ Maybe

18:59.556 --> 19:02.844
J‘ And after all

19:04.394 --> 19:07.386
J‘ You're my wonderwall J‘

19:07.480 --> 19:08.595
Thank you.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.732
- [clapping]

38:17.254 --> 38:19.370
...let me go back.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.376
Let me go back one more time.

38:23.427 --> 38:26.009
I'll do it right,
I'll do it right this time.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.714
I'm sorry, Penny.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.386
I'll change it.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.601
I'll change it.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.526
[Charlie] How'd you know
Claire was drowning?

38:43.614 --> 38:46.401
I could hear her calling for help.

38:47.367 --> 38:50.575
You, uh, hear the lightning as well?

38:52.164 --> 38:56.248
Just by chance, you pitched your
little rod outside Claire's tent...

38:56.335 --> 38:58.917
...and two hours later,
the lightning strikes.

39:05.469 --> 39:08.802
I don't know how you're doing it,
but I know a coward when I see one!

39:11.266 --> 39:12.597
Yeah, a coward!

39:13.352 --> 39:16.890
You don't want to know what happened
to me when I turned that key!

39:16.980 --> 39:20.723
You don't want to know! You don't
want to know what happened to me!

39:20.817 --> 39:23.980
You don't want to know!
You don't want to know!

39:26.823 --> 39:29.610
- It doesn't matter what you do...
- What are you doing?

39:29.701 --> 39:32.943
- ...you can't change it. [sobbing]
- [Charlie coughing]

39:34.122 --> 39:38.491
You can't change it, no matter what you
try to do, you just can't change it...

39:41.713 --> 39:45.001
He's wankered.
Let's get him to his tent.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.883
Alright, Des, come on, gimme your arm.

39:48.929 --> 39:51.136
Come on, stand up. Stand up.

39:52.849 --> 39:55.306
OK, OK. I got you.

39:55.978 --> 39:59.562
You're a good man, Charlie.

39:59.648 --> 40:02.936
Listen, I'm sorry I tried
to strangle you, alright?

40:03.026 --> 40:04.607
Fair play, mate. Here we go.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.361
Sorry I called you a coward.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.487
You're right, pal.

40:13.996 --> 40:15.031
Desmond...

40:19.042 --> 40:22.034
...you are going to tell me
what happened to you.

40:29.553 --> 40:31.089
When I turned that key...

40:35.767 --> 40:37.507
...my life...

40:39.521 --> 40:41.386
...flashed before my eyes.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.773
And then I was back in the jungle.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.311
And still on this bloody island.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.363
But those flashes, Charlie...

40:53.869 --> 40:56.451
...those flashes, they didn't stop.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.412
So...

40:59.499 --> 41:02.161
...you're telling me you saw a "flash"

41:02.252 --> 41:05.540
of Claire drowning this morning?
That's how you knew to save her?

41:06.006 --> 41:08.497
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.

41:10.761 --> 41:12.752
I was saving you.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.802
This morning...

41:17.893 --> 41:20.009
...you dove in after Claire.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.554
You tried to save her, but...

41:29.071 --> 41:30.607
...you drowned.

41:33.075 --> 41:36.033
What are you talking about?
I didn't drown.

41:36.703 --> 41:39.991
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,

41:40.082 --> 41:42.038
you were electrocuted.

41:43.585 --> 41:46.247
And when you heard
Claire was in the water, you...

41:47.172 --> 41:49.754
...you drowned trying to save her.

41:51.051 --> 41:54.088
I dove in myself so you never went in!
I've tried, brother.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.795
I've tried twice to save you, but...

41:57.599 --> 42:00.591
...the universe has a way
of course correcting,

42:01.770 --> 42:04.261
and I can't stop it forever.

42:06.108 --> 42:09.942
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, because...

42:13.782 --> 42:15.647
...no matter what I try to do...

42:20.664 --> 42:22.450
...you're gonna die, Charlie.
