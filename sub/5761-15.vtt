WEBVTT

00:08.700 --> 00:10.900
My name is Melinda Gordon.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.200
I'm married,

00:12.300 --> 00:14.500
I live in a small town,

00:14.600 --> 00:16.400
and I own an antique shop.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.500
I might be just like you.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.300
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:20.400 --> 00:22.900
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
It's all right, honey.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.100
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:27.208 --> 00:29.900
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:30.003 --> 00:33.704
and they come to me for help.

00:35.205 --> 00:40.605
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:42.305 --> 00:47.709
Anyway so the great thing about antiques
is their connection with the past

00:47.809 --> 00:51.700
and all the stories behind them.

00:52.106 --> 00:54.600
Um, vintage is really hot right now.

00:54.707 --> 00:58.601
And I sell tons of these
1930s bed jackets.

00:58.705 --> 01:02.903
This one actually belonged to the Thelma Sedgwick estate.

01:03.007 --> 01:08.803
But most importantly, ladies,
it looks hot with a pair of jeans.

01:11.407 --> 01:12.601
You.

01:12.706 --> 01:16.903
So, like, how much money do you make?

01:21.507 --> 01:26.403
You know what? Actually,
that's a great question.

01:31.005 --> 01:33.902
- Thank god that is over!
- Ah, come on. That was fun.

01:34.007 --> 01:36.701
If I didn't have to work nights
all week, I'd come back tomorrow.

01:36.808 --> 01:38.503
Ooh, listen to you,
mr. Big man on campus.

01:38.605 --> 01:41.002
I'd rather poke myself in the eye
than have to go back in there.

01:41.105 --> 01:43.103
Ha ha. It sounds like
you had a rough crowd.

01:43.206 --> 01:45.500
No. It's just i don't think
they got the concept, you know?

01:45.605 --> 01:50.402
Antique to them is an mp3 player
with no video screen.

01:50.506 --> 01:52.701
So how did your real estate talk do?

01:52.806 --> 01:56.901
Great. I just hooked them with "you can
make $1 million before you're 30" line.

01:57.007 --> 01:58.701
It worked.

01:58.806 --> 02:02.101
Oh, isn't that, uh--oh, shoot.
I forgot her name.

02:02.207 --> 02:06.502
- The new girl.
- Right. Village java.

02:07.308 --> 02:11.402
- You have a little mocha right there.
- That's her lipstick, stupid.

02:11.507 --> 02:14.203
Oh, my bad.

02:16.808 --> 02:19.701
See, that's how I pictured you in high school.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.401
Not quite.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.207 --> 02:47.602
Do it.

02:47.707 --> 02:50.802
They did it to you.

03:19.206 --> 03:22.702
Episode 2x15
"Mean Ghost"

03:29.106 --> 03:30.503
It can't be broken.

03:30.606 --> 03:34.101
We're already down two girls,
and semifinals are days away.

03:34.206 --> 03:35.201
Tell him!

03:35.307 --> 03:37.400
Ok, let's not panic until we get an x-ray.

03:37.506 --> 03:40.502
- It might just be sprained.
- This is your fault. You pushed me!

03:40.608 --> 03:42.902
- Ok, I don't think anyone--
- I wasn't even close to you.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.803
Did you see what happened?

03:44.907 --> 03:48.003
Yeah. Kind of.
It looked like an accident.

03:48.105 --> 03:49.803
Didn't I see you in the cafeteria
this morning?

03:49.907 --> 03:51.802
I'm here for career week.
Melinda Gordon.

03:51.905 --> 03:54.603
Jackie Boyd.
I coach cheerleading.

03:54.707 --> 03:56.301
- You think she's out?
- Well, it's not just her.

03:56.405 --> 03:59.202
We've had two other accidents
these last two weeks.

03:59.308 --> 04:00.901
Three girls down now.

04:01.006 --> 04:05.201
Makes for kind of a lopsided pyramid.

04:05.607 --> 04:11.200
Ok, people, you all have better
things to do, so go do them.

04:14.607 --> 04:17.903
- There you go. One dry half-caf.
- Thanks.

04:18.005 --> 04:23.501
- Uh, what was your name?
- Oh. Madison, Maddy. Either one.

04:26.406 --> 04:29.201
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, the coffee was hot.

04:29.308 --> 04:31.301
Oh. Sorry.

04:31.407 --> 04:34.102
Oh, jeez. Voodoo girl's working.

04:34.206 --> 04:35.902
What about that accident
with the cheerleader?

04:36.007 --> 04:37.102
That was kind of freaky, huh?

04:37.205 --> 04:41.401
Screw it. I've got chem lab.
I need my buzz.

04:41.505 --> 04:43.302
Um, no, not really.

04:43.407 --> 04:47.902
I mean, that's why there's seat belt laws.

04:51.408 --> 04:54.302
Two non-fat capps, please.
And could you maybe make those better

04:54.408 --> 04:58.001
than that piss water
you gave me yesterday?

04:58.107 --> 05:01.701
Sure. I'd be delighted to.

05:02.208 --> 05:05.002
Ok. Talk about a walking
fashion faux pas.

05:05.105 --> 05:09.903
I mean, that nose thing.
Fine, we can deal with that.

05:10.007 --> 05:11.500
I'm so-- so sorry.

05:11.607 --> 05:15.001
- I don't know how that happened.
- Do you know how much this costs?

05:15.107 --> 05:19.402
Oh, my god.
You are gonna pay for that.

05:22.508 --> 05:23.902
Hi! How's your cheerleader?

05:24.007 --> 05:26.501
Which  one? The one that fell out
of the moving car

05:26.607 --> 05:28.500
or the one that fell
10 feet off the bleachers?

05:28.605 --> 05:30.501
Well, I was gonna see if I could
come by your practice,

05:30.605 --> 05:32.101
but maybe now is not a good time.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.603
No. Maybe you should.

05:33.705 --> 05:38.801
It might be good for the girls
to have an audience.

06:09.906 --> 06:12.502
Watch out!

06:21.707 --> 06:23.903
Why are you doing this?
I can help you.

06:24.006 --> 06:27.102
They did it to me.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.801
You are so dead.

06:32.605 --> 06:35.703
Hey, I didn't do anything, except for
stand here, watching you being lame.

06:35.806 --> 06:37.602
Go, team. Rah, rah.

06:37.705 --> 06:40.401
Look, maddy. Whatever creepy mojo
you're into, it's not gonna work.

06:40.506 --> 06:44.001
I don't care how many lizard heads you
bite off. We're going to regionals.

06:44.107 --> 06:45.803
Just let it go. Don't stress.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.301
You're right Curt. We wouldn't want
her to stress. She might mess her hair.

06:49.405 --> 06:54.901
You ever think all this bad luck
is just karma for you bagging
your dead friend's guy?

06:55.007 --> 07:01.300
You know what? She is so noxious.
Ok? She's not worth it. She never was.

07:08.008 --> 07:10.503
You had a cheerleader die recently.

07:10.608 --> 07:12.802
Yeah. Tais.

07:12.906 --> 07:15.402
Just about this time last year.
It was an accident.

07:15.506 --> 07:19.503
- A cheerleading accident?
- No, it was really a freak thing.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.503
She got locked in the boiler room.
She died trying to get out.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.502
Do you know why she was down there?

07:24.608 --> 07:27.801
I'm not sure,
but it's kind of a hangout.

07:27.907 --> 07:29.201
Well, it was.

07:29.308 --> 07:33.301
Since the accident, no one goes
down there. Why are you asking?

07:33.408 --> 07:38.300
It's just that grief can
come out in such weird ways.

07:38.405 --> 07:42.002
I'm sure that all of this
has really thrown the team.

07:42.108 --> 07:44.700
I know a little bit about grief, too.

07:44.806 --> 07:47.901
And sometimes the best thing we do
is to just keep focused

07:48.007 --> 07:49.301
and work your butt off.

07:49.405 --> 07:50.702
Get through it.

07:50.806 --> 07:52.802
That's what I try to teach
these girls anyway.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.500
- Maybe they need another outlet.
- Look, they've had counseling.

07:55.606 --> 08:00.902
They've had time off.
All they need to do is focus now.

08:01.808 --> 08:05.101
Hey, you know, it was intense,

08:05.205 --> 08:06.901
what happened with Rana and Maddy.
What's up?

08:07.008 --> 08:09.502
I give up trying to figure out
these girls' social lives,

08:09.605 --> 08:14.600
but clearly, maddy's one
that just doesn't fit in.

08:21.506 --> 08:25.402
Melinda, I heard about
what happened today.

08:25.507 --> 08:26.403
You did?

08:26.505 --> 08:28.402
You can tell me.
Is it true?

08:28.507 --> 08:29.700
Is what true?

08:29.806 --> 08:33.400
That you're a total freak!

08:34.107 --> 08:36.301
Freak!

08:36.405 --> 08:38.203
Freak.

08:38.307 --> 08:41.100
A total freak.

08:42.006 --> 08:44.402
Freak! 

09:56.808 --> 09:59.602
Hey, open up!

10:02.606 --> 10:05.603
Tais, what happened down here?

10:05.706 --> 10:08.601
Please. I wanna help you.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.601
I want justice!

10:23.808 --> 10:25.503
Sorry. That was my fault.

10:25.607 --> 10:27.401
No. It's fine.

10:27.508 --> 10:30.101
Hey, uh, you're that
antique chick, right?

10:30.207 --> 10:31.902
Yeah. It pretty much feels that way.

10:32.005 --> 10:35.000
Way to keep going, even though
nobody was listening.

10:35.108 --> 10:36.802
A wesome.

10:36.905 --> 10:40.203
Um, can I ask you a question?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.100
Ok.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.702
Well, according to Maddy,
you were Tais' boyfriend.

10:44.807 --> 10:48.802
So why do you think all these
accidents are happening?

10:48.905 --> 10:51.402
Uh, I don't know.

10:51.507 --> 10:55.500
I guess everybody's still a little
freaked out, especially Rana.

10:55.608 --> 10:56.903
Especially?

10:57.006 --> 10:59.703
Yeah. They were, like, best friends.
You know, really tight.

10:59.808 --> 11:02.200
And now you're going out with Rana?

11:02.303 --> 11:08.104
- Well, yeah. But it wasn't like--
- I didn't mean it that way.

11:10.105 --> 11:11.605
Is  that a yearbook?

11:11.705 --> 11:12.709
Yeah.

11:12.809 --> 11:14.000
Can I borrow it?

11:14.105 --> 11:16.201
Sure. What for?

11:16.306 --> 11:18.103
Well, because, you know, I'm asking,

11:18.207 --> 11:21.800
and you're a nice guy who wants
to help out the antique chick.

11:21.908 --> 11:26.300
Cool.

12:15.805 --> 12:18.103
Rana.

12:50.307 --> 12:52.101
Do it.

12:52.207 --> 12:55.900
- What's happening?
- Do it!

12:59.608 --> 13:02.903
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?

13:03.008 --> 13:04.303
Who are you talking to?

13:04.408 --> 13:06.803
Do it to them.
They did it to you.

13:06.908 --> 13:09.402
"Do it to them. They did it to you"?
What does that mean?

13:09.506 --> 13:12.602
Ok. Why are you doing
our justice cheer?

13:12.708 --> 13:15.502
Do it. Do it.

13:25.106 --> 13:26.503
That'll get you some air.
Come on! Let's get out of here.

13:26.605 --> 13:29.701
Don't touch me!
You're a freak.

13:29.807 --> 13:33.100
What the hell is this?

13:35.407 --> 13:38.902
No one else was in there.

13:39.008 --> 13:40.700
I'm sorry about all this.

13:40.807 --> 13:43.703
I'll figure it out, ok?

13:43.806 --> 13:46.801
See you tomorrow.

13:49.408 --> 13:50.602
She's a little freaked out.

13:50.706 --> 13:53.201
Yeah. I imagine she would be.

13:53.306 --> 13:55.103
How did you get to be
in the locker room?

13:55.207 --> 13:57.202
I was in the gym,
and I heard her screaming.

13:57.308 --> 13:59.801
What were you doing in the gym?

13:59.905 --> 14:01.103
Wait a minute.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.303
- You're not thinking...
- I don't know what I'm thinking.

14:03.408 --> 14:06.203
Rana said you were talking to someone,
but there was no one else there.

14:06.305 --> 14:09.000
It may have appeared that way, but--

14:09.106 --> 14:10.503
Look, Melinda,

14:10.607 --> 14:12.302
I appreciate it if you're trying to help.

14:12.406 --> 14:15.203
But how about you just
stick to career week, ok?

14:15.305 --> 14:17.703
Sorry.

14:17.905 --> 14:20.301
Jackie...

14:20.407 --> 14:22.600
what's the justice cheer?

14:22.705 --> 14:23.803
Why?

14:23.907 --> 14:25.500
Rana was saying it before.

14:25.608 --> 14:29.701
She was upset so i thought
maybe it made her feel better.

14:29.805 --> 14:32.102
It's a football cheer,
when we're losing.

14:32.208 --> 14:38.700
"Push it, push it, push it on through.
Do it to them like they did it to you."

14:38.806 --> 14:42.200
Curt said that Tais and Rana were best
friends. Why is Tais attacking her?

14:42.307 --> 14:45.100
You said Curt's going out
with Rana now. Case closed.

14:45.207 --> 14:48.500
I don't think so. Otherwise she'd be
going after curt, too. And she isn't.

14:48.606 --> 14:50.000
But there is the goth girl--Maddy.

14:50.105 --> 14:53.403
And Rana accused her of being into
some kind of creepy mojo stuff.

14:53.508 --> 14:57.001
You know, maybe Maddy is into
some kind of witchcraft.

14:57.108 --> 14:59.001
What, do we believe in witchcraft now?

14:59.105 --> 15:01.102
Who am I not to believe in anything?

15:01.207 --> 15:04.001
Besides, it would explain why Tais is
hanging out with the social outcasts

15:04.105 --> 15:05.700
and attacking her best friend.

15:05.806 --> 15:09.003
Ah, high school. It makes Washington
politics look like preschool.

15:09.106 --> 15:11.302
There's not much else I can do
at the high school.

15:11.408 --> 15:14.201
You should have seen the way the coach
looked at me, like I was a total freak.

15:14.307 --> 15:16.403
And that's how I felt,
you know, like a total freak.

15:16.505 --> 15:19.601
I was right back in
my old high school,

15:19.705 --> 15:22.201
and everybody was looking at me
like I have two heads.

15:22.306 --> 15:23.602
I've seen your high school pictures.

15:23.708 --> 15:28.202
In fact, I've looked
at them quite a lot.

15:28.306 --> 15:31.503
You were never a freak.

15:31.605 --> 15:33.503
A big nerd maybe, but not a freak.

15:33.605 --> 15:35.902
- You're really good at comforting me.
- Anytime.

15:36.007 --> 15:39.401
You want some more tea?

15:40.908 --> 15:43.001
Please, you gotta help me.

15:43.106 --> 15:45.200
Peggy will fail science
if I don't get it turned in.

15:45.308 --> 15:46.502
Ok, not now.

15:46.608 --> 15:50.002
You know, she's a nice girl, and she's
not very science-minded, but, oh, man.

15:50.108 --> 15:56.200
She's cute! No, it's in my locker right
there. Right there. It's in my locker.

15:56.306 --> 16:00.400
She needs it right now. 5-22-10!
Say it. 5-22-10.

16:00.508 --> 16:02.801
Ok, I am not your errand girl, all right?

16:02.908 --> 16:04.301
Now, go into that light.

16:04.405 --> 16:07.502
There are some very nice
non-science-minded girls in there.

16:07.606 --> 16:09.701
So just shoo, please.

16:09.808 --> 16:13.702
Melinda?
Who are you talking to?

16:26.508 --> 16:27.401
You ok?

16:27.508 --> 16:30.401
Yeah, sorry. I just drifted for a minute.

16:30.508 --> 16:35.801
- All right. I'm going to go up.
- Ok. I'll be up soon.

16:44.705 --> 16:47.001
I just don't know how
this is any of your business.

16:47.107 --> 16:51.300
You know what? It's not.
But I'm asking anyway.

16:51.407 --> 16:54.001
Jackie told me that you and Tais
were friends.

16:54.106 --> 16:57.400
So? I was stupid once.

16:59.605 --> 17:02.701
- You think I locked her in
the boiler room? - Did you?

17:02.808 --> 17:05.800
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Killed her dead.

17:05.906 --> 17:07.700
Good riddance, too.

17:07.806 --> 17:12.301
Wow. You know, I am impressed
by how tough you are.

17:12.406 --> 17:17.300
But I am just trying to find out
what happened before Tais died

17:17.406 --> 17:22.102
and if it has anything to do
with what's happening now.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.400
I thought we were friends.

17:24.505 --> 17:26.002
I was wrong.

17:26.107 --> 17:28.002
So why did you join the team?

17:28.108 --> 17:29.601
I was into dance.

17:29.706 --> 17:33.402
Modern stuff, my own choreography.

17:33.507 --> 17:36.503
I was doing a piece one day on the field.

17:36.605 --> 17:40.000
It was my second week,
when nobody even talked to me.

17:40.108 --> 17:44.402
But  Tais, she saw what I was doing and

17:45.606 --> 17:48.603
asked me to be on the team
just like that.

17:48.705 --> 17:50.200
Is that when you became friends?

17:50.307 --> 17:55.201
Tais was the only one who never
treated me like I was a freak.

17:55.308 --> 17:59.901
And if you're cool with Tais,
then you're in.

18:00.005 --> 18:03.202
Everyone liked my house the best 
because my dad let us stay up late

18:03.307 --> 18:05.003
and eat junk food.

18:05.108 --> 18:06.602
It was the best when it was
just the three of us.

18:06.705 --> 18:10.701
We'd read out of our journals
and talk about everything--

18:10.805 --> 18:15.603
what boys we liked, school,
problems with our families,

18:15.707 --> 18:19.403
our deepest, darkest secrets.

18:19.508 --> 18:23.101
Man, I really trusted them.

18:24.207 --> 18:27.900
I was popular.
I had friends.

18:28.408 --> 18:32.502
And I was really good at something.

18:33.407 --> 18:37.603
And  then I woke up.
And it was all just a dream.

18:37.707 --> 18:40.200
The end.

18:42.606 --> 18:45.100
So what happened?

18:45.207 --> 18:48.300
Why'd you wake up?

18:48.607 --> 18:50.703
You ask too many questions.

18:50.807 --> 18:53.001
Bye.

20:31.708 --> 20:36.002
Fire, water, moon, and sun.
We come to you all as one.

20:36.106 --> 20:41.902
The wrath and ire that she creates
return to her a crueler fate.

20:47.008 --> 20:51.500
Fire, water, moon, and sun.
We come to you all as one.

20:51.608 --> 20:57.400
The wrath and ire that she creates
return to her a crueler fate.

21:28.008 --> 21:31.202
They left me to die.

21:42.708 --> 21:46.400
You have no idea which of those girls
was burned in effigy last night?

21:46.508 --> 21:48.200
Whoever it is is Maddy's next target.

21:48.306 --> 21:54.300
All right, so a group of outcasts get
together to put hexes on cheerleaders.

21:54.406 --> 21:57.602
You know, if word gets out, this
could be a pretty popular teen sport.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.303
Except these girls are clueless,

21:59.406 --> 22:02.901
because it's not spells that are
bringing down cheerleaders. Tais is.

22:03.007 --> 22:05.200
- But why would Tais want to
hurt her friends? - I don't know.

22:05.306 --> 22:10.403
Maybe she thinks they're
responsible for her death.

22:11.007 --> 22:13.401
You think those herbal pouches
they found in the boiler room

22:13.506 --> 22:15.800
- have something to do with it?
- Doubt it.

22:15.908 --> 22:17.903
Maddy didn't want Tais
to be a part of her ritual.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.702
In fact, she didn't even know
that she was there.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.301
But she did mean to hurt cheerleaders.

22:21.406 --> 22:25.903
Right. So maybe her coven's angry
energy is influencing Tais somehow.

22:26.006 --> 22:27.901
Look, if they were down there
in the boiler room with those herbs,

22:28.007 --> 22:30.701
maybe Tais attached herself
to them there.

22:30.807 --> 22:35.100
So the justice that Tais is looking for
is about Maddy and her friends, not her.

22:35.207 --> 22:38.202
That's because she didn't read
the first rule of the Wiccan faith--

22:38.305 --> 22:39.601
"do no harm to others."

22:39.705 --> 22:45.101
Ok, well, maybe this is
the teen angst version of Wicca.

22:45.205 --> 22:47.903
Oh, my god.

23:06.305 --> 23:07.401
Come on. I'm fine.

23:07.506 --> 23:12.101
Drop it. You're not working out on that leg.

23:38.507 --> 23:40.201
Jackie!

23:40.306 --> 23:41.800
Jackie, what happened?

23:41.906 --> 23:43.501
A girl fell in practice.

23:43.606 --> 23:46.200
She was out for a few minutes,
but they think she'll be ok.

23:46.305 --> 23:47.803
I'm so sorry.

23:47.908 --> 23:50.403
I should have canceled the season
before it got this bad.

23:50.505 --> 23:53.003
I don't think that would've helped.

23:53.107 --> 23:55.801
You know, you said something to me before

23:55.906 --> 24:00.102
that you know something about grief.

24:02.605 --> 24:05.501
I lost my little brother 5 years ago.

24:05.607 --> 24:09.203
He was only 9. And I never
let myself stop to think about it.

24:09.305 --> 24:10.803
Never.

24:10.905 --> 24:14.101
I took this job,
tried to make a difference.

24:14.207 --> 24:15.702
I kept busy.

24:15.806 --> 24:18.700
And I thought the same thing should
happen with these girls, you know,

24:18.806 --> 24:24.002
that they'd get over it quicker
if they just kept moving forward.

24:24.106 --> 24:28.801
Jackie, everybody has to feel their
feelings, no matter how much it hurts.

24:28.907 --> 24:32.201
I feel them, all right.
I just don't talk about them.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.303
And I guess I expected
the same thing with these girls,

24:34.406 --> 24:37.600
you know, for them to just
suck it up and go on.

24:37.707 --> 24:40.502
I told them Tais was the heart
of the team and they were the soul.

24:40.608 --> 24:43.200
Well, you were right about that.

24:43.306 --> 24:45.102
And you did get these girls
to the semi-finals.

24:45.206 --> 24:47.002
So there is something good
in all of this.

24:47.107 --> 24:48.901
Yeah, beat up, demoralized,

24:49.007 --> 24:51.402
and wondering who's gonna
fall on their ass next.

24:51.505 --> 24:52.903
"Way to go, Jackie."

24:53.006 --> 24:55.400
You know what?
This is not your fault.

24:55.505 --> 24:58.703
Ok? Maybe there is just some
bad energy around the team.

24:58.806 --> 25:01.602
Not for long.

25:21.007 --> 25:24.302
Cut the crap.
I know what you're doing.

25:24.408 --> 25:27.700
I'm a dabbler in the
spirit world myself.

25:27.805 --> 25:29.900
Oh. You wiccan?
I don't think so.

25:30.008 --> 25:34.200
Except I skipped witchcraft and
went straight to seeing dead people.

25:34.308 --> 25:36.802
I saw Tais' spirit in your fire.

25:36.905 --> 25:40.203
Oh, see, now I know you're full of it,
because if Tais was here,

25:40.308 --> 25:42.503
we'd be the last people
she'd hang with.

25:42.606 --> 25:46.102
It's not your hexes that are
hurting cheerleaders. Tais is.

25:46.208 --> 25:49.601
Well, if that is true,
that is, like, really beautiful.

25:49.706 --> 25:52.401
That is like the ultimate
poetic justice.

25:52.508 --> 25:54.602
Your negative energy
is like a drug to Tais.

25:54.705 --> 25:57.600
And I'm asking you to stop
until I can cross her over.

25:57.707 --> 25:59.003
Why should I help Tais?

25:59.105 --> 26:00.602
Because if you don't,
you're no better than them.

26:00.707 --> 26:03.400
That girl turned on me
and all the others.

26:03.507 --> 26:07.202
Maddy, please don't do this.

26:08.908 --> 26:11.900
Try and stop me.

26:19.106 --> 26:22.103
Jackie told me that you
didn't really want to talk to me.

26:22.207 --> 26:23.600
Are you serious?

26:23.705 --> 26:26.201
In the locker room, you were,
like, totally talking to yourself.

26:26.306 --> 26:28.501
Then you went all Rambo
and broke that window.

26:28.607 --> 26:31.003
What do you think is going on, Rana?

26:31.107 --> 26:34.403
- Do you think Maddy's doing something?
- Maddy is like the devil, ok?

26:34.505 --> 26:36.601
She was totally normal one day,
and then she's out of, like,

26:36.707 --> 26:39.901
- a Tim Burton movie the next.
- Right. After you guys turned on her.

26:40.007 --> 26:41.801
Yeah. How good a move was that!

26:41.908 --> 26:44.202
It was like I saw the
writing on the tea leaves.

26:44.307 --> 26:46.701
I think you mean the
writing on the wall.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.903
What are you, my english teacher now?

26:49.006 --> 26:53.100
Whatever. I just know that we speak,
Maddy's probably sticking some big pin

26:53.206 --> 26:55.100
into a doll with my name on it.

26:55.206 --> 26:59.400
What happened with you and Maddy,
with everybody and Maddy?

26:59.507 --> 27:01.800
You mean, why did we 
kick her off the team?

27:01.906 --> 27:04.302
Well, I got the feeling that she quit.

27:04.406 --> 27:08.001
In her dreams. We totally exited Maddy
because of what an enormous liar

27:08.106 --> 27:11.302
she turned out to be.

27:11.406 --> 27:13.503
We'd just found out
that we'd made the semifinals.

27:13.606 --> 27:16.100
Maddy was supposed to fly out
to France for the break,

27:16.208 --> 27:19.902
but we were so psyched that we wanted
to tell her, catch her beforehand.

27:20.008 --> 27:24.802
We were totally floored
by what happened next.

27:26.806 --> 27:28.102
Mr.  Strom?

27:28.205 --> 27:31.201
Dad! That was mrs. Frawley.
She wants you to send the car...

27:31.308 --> 27:34.202
to the airport.

27:35.708 --> 27:39.402
The place wasn't even theirs. Her dad
was like jeeves the butler or whatever.

27:39.506 --> 27:42.403
You know, it was just some
rich family's summer house.

27:42.608 --> 27:44.800
I totally lost all respect
for her after that.

27:44.908 --> 27:46.201
Because she wasn't rich?

27:46.308 --> 27:50.502
No. Well, yeah,
but, I mean, come on.

27:50.905 --> 27:53.401
She was poor, but I could
have gotten over that.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.802
You know, I'm not a total bitch.

27:54.905 --> 27:57.301
So what was it really?

27:57.405 --> 28:01.603
I mean, I trusted her. I told her
everything. And she lied to my face.

28:01.708 --> 28:04.402
Our entire friendship
was just a big fake-out.

28:04.507 --> 28:06.903
I couldn't be friends
with her after that.

28:07.005 --> 28:09.003
Neither could Tais.

28:09.107 --> 28:13.303
Must be nice to be
so sure about everything.

28:13.407 --> 28:16.101
Not always.

28:19.608 --> 28:21.603
It just got me.

28:21.707 --> 28:23.801
Ok, I know it's wrong that Maddy lied,

28:23.908 --> 28:27.202
but I don't think those girls would
have been friends with her if she hadn't.

28:27.305 --> 28:30.401
And if those girls just cared more
about who people were and less about

28:30.507 --> 28:32.301
what they look like
or how much money they had

28:32.406 --> 28:37.303
or if they made fools
of themselves in a hallway.

28:37.707 --> 28:39.803
I'm sorry. They're just so cavalier.

28:39.908 --> 28:42.200
They have no idea how much
pain they inflict,

28:42.305 --> 28:45.700
you know, when you're already
at your most vulnerable in life.

28:45.807 --> 28:48.300
You know, I wish I had
known you back then.

28:48.406 --> 28:51.001
I'd have kicked some ass
and taken names.

28:51.108 --> 28:53.301
You would have, wouldn't you?

28:53.405 --> 28:56.003
Hey, tell me what you're doing
before I have to go.

28:56.108 --> 28:58.802
Remember those herb pouches
that I found at the boiler room?

28:58.907 --> 29:02.103
Well, I did a search on all
the witchcraft and spell sites,

29:02.205 --> 29:04.502
because I thought maybe it was a curse,
but nothing was coming up.

29:04.606 --> 29:08.503
So then I did a broader search.

29:09.608 --> 29:12.900
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

29:13.006 --> 29:16.002
Or maybe it does.

29:26.508 --> 29:28.800
Look, I don't have anything else
to say to you.

29:28.906 --> 29:34.900
I found this in the boiler room, and
I thought maybe you had put it there.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.402
Good going, Sherlock.

29:36.506 --> 29:39.502
I didn't really know why
until I looked up what it meant--

29:39.607 --> 29:41.503
a spell for forgiveness.

29:41.607 --> 29:44.000
Rana told me about the lie
you tried to pull off with them.

29:44.108 --> 29:47.301
Is that what you needed forgiveness for,
or was it something else?

29:47.407 --> 29:49.301
Did you do something to Tais?

29:49.407 --> 29:53.200
Look, I didn't ask to be in their
stupid clique. They invited me.

29:53.305 --> 29:55.201
What did you do to Tais?

29:55.308 --> 30:00.203
What did you need forgiveness
for down in that boiler room?

30:00.306 --> 30:04.303
Tais sent me a note before she died.

30:04.406 --> 30:07.801
She said that she wanted
to meet up and talk,

30:07.907 --> 30:13.501
that our friendship was too important
to lose over something so petty.

30:13.606 --> 30:15.400
So what happened?

30:15.507 --> 30:18.303
I never went.

30:19.107 --> 30:22.702
I was too mad or ashamed or

30:24.305 --> 30:26.502
just messed up.

30:26.605 --> 30:31.800
I never went, and Tais died
down there waiting for me.

30:32.805 --> 30:35.200
So you didn't actually
do anything to Tais.

30:35.306 --> 30:38.502
No. And, you know, I don't care
if you believe me or not.

30:38.605 --> 30:43.001
I'm just really sick
of the whole thing.

30:45.806 --> 30:50.900
I'm not going back out there. I'm done
with the spells. I've made my point.

30:51.007 --> 30:56.200
If you want Tais to move on,
tell her to move on, ok?

31:40.305 --> 31:43.301
All right. That's it.
I want to talk to you this instant!

31:43.408 --> 31:47.301
- Wow. You sound like my mom.
- You can stop now, ok?

31:47.408 --> 31:50.202
Maddy broke up the coven.
She's really over it.

31:50.306 --> 31:52.802
And you may still be feeling
negative energy, but it'll wear off.

31:52.905 --> 31:54.300
That is so random.

31:54.405 --> 31:56.301
Like Maddy has anything to do
with why I'm here.

31:56.406 --> 31:58.400
You're feeding off of her energy.

31:58.505 --> 32:01.100
All of the goth girls, their anger
is giving you strength.

32:01.206 --> 32:02.703
Yeah. Right.

32:02.805 --> 32:04.803
Why would you go after them?

32:04.906 --> 32:08.301
- I mean, they were your friends,
your own kind. - No.

32:08.408 --> 32:12.101
I hate them.
I hate them all.

32:12.906 --> 32:14.602
Rana, come on.

32:14.707 --> 32:16.100
Rana, don't.

32:16.206 --> 32:18.500
Wait!

32:23.906 --> 32:26.501
Hey! Rana!

32:51.805 --> 32:54.801
Rana! Rana, help!

32:58.407 --> 33:00.802
They left me in there to die.

33:00.906 --> 33:04.103
They didn't care,
especially not Rana.

33:04.206 --> 33:08.000
Took my boyfriend, the team...

33:08.408 --> 33:12.403
Maddy was the only one who cared.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.801
I felt badly about
how I treated Maddy.

33:28.908 --> 33:32.403
Ok, so all you have to
do now is tell Maddy that.

33:32.507 --> 33:35.403
She'll be really happy, believe me.
She feels like she's responsible.

33:35.506 --> 33:37.702
I know who's responsible.

33:37.805 --> 33:39.503
And Rana knows.

33:39.607 --> 33:41.301
And all those pretty cheerleaders,

33:41.406 --> 33:43.700
they're never going to be
champions without me.

33:43.808 --> 33:45.700
Is that what this is about?

33:45.806 --> 33:48.002
You didn't get your chance,
so they don't have theirs?

33:48.106 --> 33:50.202
This is about justice.

33:50.307 --> 33:55.103
And I'm just doing to them
what they did to me.

34:05.508 --> 34:06.602
This better be good.

34:06.705 --> 34:08.803
- I don't get up this early
for anybody. - It's important.

34:08.905 --> 34:11.400
I don't want one of your girls
to get hurt before the semi-finals.

34:11.505 --> 34:13.702
Is that what you think, that
the girls are caving under pressure?

34:13.806 --> 34:16.803
Yeah. Something like that. I need you
to get a hold of Rana and Maddy.

34:16.907 --> 34:19.003
- They'll be here in 30 minutes.
- Ok. And I need you to tell them

34:19.106 --> 34:23.601
to meet us in the boiler room.
And I need you to have a little faith.

34:23.708 --> 34:28.503
Ok. No one else is getting hurt.
It's time to solve this. Rana,

34:28.608 --> 34:31.802
I need you to tell me what went wrong
between you and Tais.

34:31.906 --> 34:34.699
- You think I had something to do with--
- Rana, this is not "judge Judy."

34:34.804 --> 34:38.400
Just tell the girl
what she wants to know.

34:38.505 --> 34:40.702
We had a fight.
So what?

34:40.806 --> 34:44.000
Fine. I don't need you guys.
You want to be that way, I'm out.

34:44.108 --> 34:46.000
- I don't need you.
- Good riddance.

34:46.105 --> 34:48.101
The last thing we need
is a fake we can't trust.

34:48.208 --> 34:51.601
It's true, Maddy. I like you,
but the trust isn't there.

34:51.708 --> 34:54.402
When we fly into the air, we need to
know someone will be there to catch us.

34:54.505 --> 34:56.203
That's bull!

34:56.306 --> 35:00.001
When you guys thought I was rich,
you didn't worry about me catching you.

35:00.105 --> 35:02.603
You're kicking me off the team
because I'm not like you.

35:02.707 --> 35:05.502
And I am so glad.

35:05.608 --> 35:08.503
Screw you both.

35:10.806 --> 35:15.001
We weren't too hard on her, were we?

35:15.105 --> 35:16.700
Maddy, what happened next?

35:16.806 --> 35:21.602
I, um, I got a note from Tais
to meet her here.

35:25.305 --> 35:27.402
But I didn't go.

35:27.505 --> 35:29.903
But Rana did.

35:30.008 --> 35:36.302
I sent them both notes. They were both
supposed to meet me there, just like now.

35:36.405 --> 35:38.601
You got a letter, too, didn't you?

35:38.705 --> 35:41.202
How did you know?

35:41.308 --> 35:44.103
Remember what I told to you,
you were gonna have to have some faith?

35:44.205 --> 35:46.403
Ok.

35:46.905 --> 35:51.403
Tais is here with us right now in spirit.

35:57.105 --> 36:00.903
You freak!
You brought her ghost back.

36:01.006 --> 36:02.503
Stop it.

36:02.607 --> 36:05.501
Tais is here,
but not because of Maddy.

36:05.608 --> 36:08.400
Ask her to tell what happened next.

36:08.507 --> 36:14.501
She wants you to tell us all
what happened after you got the note.

36:15.408 --> 36:18.801
I figured Tais wanted to give me
a pep talk before the competition.

36:18.906 --> 36:21.403
But it wasn't a pep talk.
It was worse.

36:21.506 --> 36:23.703
I think we need to let
Maddy back on the team.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.800
- Are you bent? Why?
- We need her, for one thing.

36:26.905 --> 36:30.002
- Look at the moves she gave us.
- She is a loser, Tais. She lied to us!

36:30.105 --> 36:32.602
Because she knew we wouldn't even
talk to her if we knew the truth.

36:32.707 --> 36:34.803
Oh, so now you're, like,
taking her side?

36:34.906 --> 36:37.300
It's not about sides, Rana.
I liked her.

36:37.406 --> 36:41.701
She was kind of cool.
She's different.

36:41.908 --> 36:46.401
So Tais liked me because
I was different?

36:47.506 --> 36:51.602
You were special,
not like the other girls.

36:51.706 --> 36:53.802
You were smart and quirky.

36:53.906 --> 36:56.701
She's saying that you were unique.

36:56.806 --> 37:00.101
There was no one else like you,
and she missed you.

37:00.206 --> 37:03.903
Ok, I'm sorry.
You lost me at "Tais is here."

37:04.006 --> 37:08.202
I'll try and explain it later.
Just go with me.

37:08.306 --> 37:10.902
It's true.

37:11.606 --> 37:14.000
She is here.

37:14.108 --> 37:15.600
I--I can feel her.

37:15.706 --> 37:20.200
She's not angry anymore.
That's why you can feel her.

37:20.307 --> 37:22.701
Tais...

37:22.807 --> 37:25.603
we were friends for so long.

37:25.707 --> 37:29.700
I just--I wanted you all to myself.

37:29.805 --> 37:32.301
I wanted to be your best friend.

37:32.405 --> 37:34.502
No way! I am not letting her back in!

37:34.605 --> 37:35.601
She's our friend.

37:35.706 --> 37:38.201
You better figure out who your
real friends really are, Tais.

37:38.306 --> 37:40.803
Rana, come on.

37:40.908 --> 37:43.502
Rana, don't.

37:43.605 --> 37:45.603
Wait.

37:45.707 --> 37:49.600
I didn't know that the door
would lock behind me.

37:49.707 --> 37:52.702
I didn't know...

37:53.007 --> 37:56.901
until they told me they found her.

37:57.006 --> 38:00.801
I didn't tell the police
because I was so messed up.

38:00.906 --> 38:04.101
It was all my fault.

38:05.208 --> 38:07.902
It was an accident?

38:08.007 --> 38:10.200
Yes.

38:12.005 --> 38:14.700
Just a stupid accident.

38:14.807 --> 38:16.900
What have I been doing?

38:17.007 --> 38:18.200
It's not your fault.

38:18.307 --> 38:24.903
You were stuck in the middle of something
that never should've even happened.

38:28.407 --> 38:31.101
It's not their fault either.

38:31.205 --> 38:34.103
Please tell them that...

38:34.207 --> 38:37.301
I don't blame them.

38:38.005 --> 38:41.302
She's saying that she doesn't
blame either one of you.

38:41.405 --> 38:44.700
She knows it was an accident.

38:44.808 --> 38:48.802
All I wanted was for us
to be like before.

38:48.906 --> 38:51.701
I could never have
as good a friend as Rana.

38:51.807 --> 38:54.701
She just wanted everything
to be the way it was.

38:54.805 --> 38:58.800
She could have never
replaced you as her friend.

38:58.906 --> 39:02.400
Tell Maddy that I loved who she was,

39:02.507 --> 39:05.302
how her mind worked.

39:05.408 --> 39:09.903
When we talked about stuff,
I felt smart.

39:10.407 --> 39:16.300
And she really liked who you were,
not who you were trying to be.

39:21.306 --> 39:23.702
Tais, I...

39:23.805 --> 39:27.200
I thought you were so special, and I...

39:27.305 --> 39:30.303
I just miss you.

39:31.208 --> 39:36.400
When we were friends,
I felt like I could do anything.

39:36.906 --> 39:39.400
You can.

39:43.706 --> 39:46.701
It's so awesome.

39:48.606 --> 39:51.003
She sees a light.
She's ready to cross over now.

39:51.106 --> 39:53.001
No!

39:53.106 --> 39:55.602
No, she can't go yet.

39:55.708 --> 39:59.100
I need to say that I'm sorry.
And I was stupid and lame.

39:59.206 --> 40:04.101
- And if I could take it all back,
I swear. - Tell her it's ok.

40:04.207 --> 40:09.401
Tell her she's a really good person and it's ok to let others see it.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.900
I will.

40:12.905 --> 40:16.103
- What?
- There's a little boy here.

40:16.206 --> 40:19.002
A little boy?

40:19.306 --> 40:21.801
He says his name is Sean.

40:21.907 --> 40:24.200
Sean.

40:25.305 --> 40:29.302
Do either one of you know a Sean?

40:32.506 --> 40:36.201
My brother-- my baby brother.

40:37.206 --> 40:41.001
He wants me to tell his sister
that he loves her and he's happy.

40:41.107 --> 40:43.100
And he wants her to be happy, too.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.601
He says he loves you...

40:46.907 --> 40:50.103
and that he knows that you're sad
but that you don't have to be,

40:50.206 --> 40:53.202
because he isn't.

40:53.808 --> 40:57.702
- You--you see my brother?
- I don't.

40:57.805 --> 41:01.401
Tais does.
He's in the light.

41:01.506 --> 41:05.101
That's where he should be.

41:25.808 --> 41:29.101
I'd like to introduce the reigning
state champion cheerleading team--

41:29.205 --> 41:30.402
The Grandview Tigers--

41:30.505 --> 41:35.303
with an assist in choreography
by Maddy Strom!
