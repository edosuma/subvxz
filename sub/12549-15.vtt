WEBVTT

00:07.548 --> 00:08.799
- PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...
- WE HAVE A WARRANT

00:08.799 --> 00:10.431
TO ARREST YOUR SON
FOR THE MURDER OF REGINA CRANE.

00:10.431 --> 00:12.803
- I KILLED MY OWN FATHER.
- I HAVE TO TELL THEM.

00:12.803 --> 00:14.975
- I CAN'T GO TO JAIL.
- I NEED YOUR HELP.

00:14.975 --> 00:18.269
- VIKRAM AND I WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR.
- VIKRAM LIED TO YOU!

00:18.269 --> 00:20.901
HE SENT MARILYN.
SHE GOT THAT NECKLACE.

00:20.901 --> 00:23.854
- GLORIA COULDN'T MAKE IT.
- IF YOU'RE NOT RUNNING, THEN--

00:23.854 --> 00:27.027
- I'M GOING BACK.
- YOU NEED TO BE WITH
SOMEONE WHO APPRECIATES YOU.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.609
- I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.
- RICO.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.493
THESE NIGHTS
THAT WE'VE SPENT
HERE IN OUR BOOTH,

00:32.493 --> 00:34.655
THEY'RE SOME
OF THE BEST NIGHTS
OF MY LIFE.

00:34.655 --> 00:36.157
I'M CHARLIE McBRIDE.
I'M NEW IN TOWN.

00:36.157 --> 00:38.419
DANNY, THE WHOLE TOWN
WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.

00:38.419 --> 00:40.421
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:40.421 --> 00:42.713
VIKRAM, IT'S ME AGAIN.
WHY AREN'T YOU PICKING UP?

00:42.713 --> 00:44.795
YOU NEED
TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

00:46.717 --> 00:48.719
( kids chattering )

01:01.892 --> 01:03.314
HEY.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.646
HEY, DANNY.
WELCOME BACK.

01:06.897 --> 01:08.989
YEAH. SORRY, MAN.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.282
LOOK ALIVE, DESAI.

01:12.903 --> 01:14.155
SO, YOU READY
TO SUIT UP?

01:14.155 --> 01:16.076
YEAH, SURE, I GUESS.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.199
LACEY WAS SO BADASS,

01:18.199 --> 01:21.372
EXPOSING THE WHOLE
ME-GETTING-POISONED THING.

01:21.372 --> 01:24.084
- RIGHT, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
- YEAH, SHE CALLED ARCHIE OUT,

01:24.084 --> 01:26.667
THEN SCOTT CRUMBLED,
CONFESSED

01:26.667 --> 01:28.088
AND NOW THEY'RE
BOTH EXPELLED.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.800
THEY'RE LUCKY
THEY DIDN'T GET ARRESTED.

01:29.800 --> 01:34.675
- RIGHT.
- SO, IT'S ALL GOOD, MAN.
ALL RIGHT?

01:34.675 --> 01:37.558
HEY, ESPECIALLY NOW
THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
YOU DIDN'T KILL REGINA.

01:40.561 --> 01:43.684
SO, HOMECOMING--
HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT IT?

01:43.684 --> 01:45.316
LAME? COOL?

01:45.316 --> 01:47.778
UM, HOMECOMING IS
TOTALLY COOL

01:47.778 --> 01:51.071
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS ONE'S
GONNA BE ONE OF THE GREATEST
NIGHTS OF THE YEAR.

01:51.071 --> 01:53.073
- WOW.
- SORRY.

01:53.073 --> 01:54.905
THAT IS A LOT OF PRESSURE.

01:54.905 --> 01:56.827
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
YOU PICK THE RIGHT MAN
FOR THE JOB.

01:58.829 --> 02:01.952
- DANNY! HOW YOU DOING?
- HEY.

02:06.957 --> 02:08.339
( door opens )

02:08.339 --> 02:10.381
HEY, DESAI.

02:10.381 --> 02:11.922
YOU'VE GOT
A NEW ROOMMATE.

02:12.963 --> 02:14.845
TRY NOT TO STRANGLE HIM.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.150
OH, SORRY.
THIS IS THE NEW GUY--

02:30.150 --> 02:31.902
NEWER THAN YOU,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.034
JUST MOVED INTO TOWN.
HE'S ACTUALLY WORKING
AT THE STABLES.

02:34.034 --> 02:35.236
CHARLIE.

02:36.237 --> 02:37.988
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.742
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

02:43.784 --> 02:45.786
( theme music playing )

02:50.961 --> 02:52.923
- ( school bell rings )
- Girl: WAIT UP!

02:52.923 --> 02:55.636
- DANNY.
- HI.

02:55.636 --> 02:56.887
IT'S SO GREAT
HAVING YOU HERE.

02:56.887 --> 02:58.639
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE BACK.

02:58.639 --> 03:00.561
IT'S LIKE A DO-OVER
FOR ALL OF US.

03:00.561 --> 03:02.393
( chattering )

03:02.393 --> 03:04.305
- OR AT LEAST
I THOUGHT IT WAS.
- NO. NO, IT IS.

03:04.305 --> 03:06.397
IT IS.
IT'S GREAT SEEING YOU.

03:06.397 --> 03:08.859
REALLY. UH, LACEY,

03:08.859 --> 03:10.861
LISTEN,
THAT NEW GUY, CHARLIE--

03:10.861 --> 03:13.944
- OH GOD, NO, HE'S JUST--
- NO, HOW-- HOW WELL
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

03:13.944 --> 03:16.657
AS WELL AS YOU CAN
KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S
BEEN HERE FOR TWO DAYS.

03:16.657 --> 03:17.988
HE WAS ASKING ME
ABOUT HOMECOMING--

03:17.988 --> 03:19.490
ABOUT IT, NOT TO IT.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.951
- HOMECOMING, HUH?
- YEAH.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.913
THE THEME'S "A NIGHT
TO REMEMBER" THIS YEAR.

03:22.913 --> 03:24.585
SOUNDS KIND OF FUN,
YOU KNOW.

03:24.585 --> 03:27.668
I WAS THINKING
THAT I COULD MAKE IT
REALLY MEMORABLE

03:27.668 --> 03:29.630
AND WEAR SOMETHING
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO WHAT

03:29.630 --> 03:31.462
MY MOM CALLS
SCHOOL INAPPROPRIATE.

03:31.462 --> 03:32.923
( inhales sharply )

03:32.923 --> 03:35.045
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT,
WE COULD JUST--

03:35.045 --> 03:36.967
YOU KNOW WHAT, LACEY?

03:36.967 --> 03:39.009
COULD WE TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER?

03:39.009 --> 03:40.220
I JUST-- I GOTTA...

03:42.763 --> 03:44.435
OKAY.

03:44.435 --> 03:45.806
( scoffs )

03:47.728 --> 03:50.060
CRAZY HOW THIS
ALL TURNED OUT, HUH?

03:50.060 --> 03:51.652
SARITA, IF YOU'RE
HERE TO APOLOGIZE,

03:51.652 --> 03:53.023
I REALLY THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD TALK TO DANNY.

03:53.023 --> 03:55.906
OH NO, DANNY MAY
BE OFF THE HOOK
FOR REGINA'S MURDER,

03:55.906 --> 03:57.778
BUT YOU'RE STILL
SUCKING FACE WITH A KILLER,

03:57.778 --> 03:59.620
IN CASE
YOU FORGOT THE AUNT.

04:06.036 --> 04:07.418
WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:07.418 --> 04:08.709
EASY, MAN.

04:08.709 --> 04:12.543
LOOK, THEY LET ME
OUT EARLY.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.005
GOOD BEHAVIOR.
( laughs )

04:15.005 --> 04:16.427
SO WHAT,
YOU FOLLOWED ME?

04:16.427 --> 04:19.590
NO. I REMEMBERED
HOW YOU USED TO TALK
ABOUT THE PLACE,

04:19.590 --> 04:21.842
HOW GREAT
JO AND LACEY SEEMED

04:21.842 --> 04:25.846
AND HOW YOU WERE
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND
TO ME ON THE INSIDE...

04:27.097 --> 04:29.019
WHICH IS SOMETHING
I COULD REALLY USE RIGHT NOW.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.022
( laughs )
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.694
- THIS IS LIKE--
- LOOK...

04:34.775 --> 04:35.946
I JUST WANT
TO START OVER.

04:36.947 --> 04:38.359
CLEAN SLATE, YOU KNOW?

04:39.990 --> 04:42.112
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, MAN.
- DANNY, COME ON.

04:43.904 --> 04:45.706
I'M KINDA DESPERATE HERE.

04:51.171 --> 04:52.963
LUCKILY,
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

04:54.965 --> 04:57.257
WE BOTH GOT PRETTY GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS, RIGHT?

04:58.759 --> 05:00.180
SO LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

05:04.425 --> 05:06.927
HE JUST SEEMS STRANGE
AND KIND OF DISTANT.

05:06.927 --> 05:10.020
WELL, HE'S BEEN
THROUGH A LOT, SO--

05:10.020 --> 05:11.932
NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT.
I THINK IT'S ME.

05:11.932 --> 05:13.103
I THINK
HE'S STILL PISSED.

05:14.234 --> 05:15.396
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE

05:15.396 --> 05:16.777
TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT THIS--

05:16.777 --> 05:18.028
WITH YOU. I'M--

05:18.028 --> 05:19.069
NO, IT'S FINE.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.822
DANNY'S FINE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

05:24.995 --> 05:26.747
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING
NOT BEING ABLE

05:26.747 --> 05:29.500
TO TELL ANYONE
THE TRUTH THAT DANNY
NEVER WAS A KILLER.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.122
I TOLD YOU
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

05:32.122 --> 05:33.954
WELL, THEN I JUST WANT
EVERYTHING TO GO BACK

05:33.954 --> 05:36.797
- TO THE WAY IT WAS.
- WELL, IT KIND OF IS.

05:36.797 --> 05:41.301
I MEAN, EXCEPT YOU AND I
ARE FRIENDS NOW, I GUESS.

05:41.301 --> 05:44.845
YES. AND I LOVE THAT.

05:46.887 --> 05:48.469
AND THE ONLY OTHER THING
THAT I WANT DIFFERENT

05:48.469 --> 05:50.521
IS TO BE ABLE
TO DATE DANNY
OUT IN THE OPEN--

05:50.521 --> 05:52.062
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE
REALLY OKAY WITH THAT.

05:52.062 --> 05:55.476
YEAH, I AM. YES.

05:55.476 --> 05:58.739
YOU AND DANNY SHOULD
JUST GO TO HOMECOMING

05:58.739 --> 06:00.280
AND WHATEVER.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.943
EXCEPT RIGHT NOW,
HOMECOMING SEEMS TO BE

06:02.943 --> 06:04.985
THE FURTHEST THING
FROM DANNY'S MIND.

06:10.991 --> 06:12.953
OKAY, LOOK, HEY,
I DON'T WANNA--

06:12.953 --> 06:13.954
LAMENESS SCALE
OF ONE TO 10,

06:13.954 --> 06:16.707
WE ALWAYS SAID
HOMECOMING WAS AN 11, BUT...

06:18.879 --> 06:21.802
JO, WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

06:21.802 --> 06:24.384
I WAS JUST THINKING--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH

06:24.384 --> 06:26.887
A COUPLE OF FRIENDS
GETTING TOGETHER,

06:26.887 --> 06:30.180
GETTING DRESSED UP
AND CUTTING A RUG?

06:30.180 --> 06:32.102
( sighs, yelps )

06:32.102 --> 06:34.104
"CUTTING A RUG"?

06:34.104 --> 06:36.777
UH, YEAH,
IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

06:36.777 --> 06:38.689
YEAH, FROM THE 1890s.

06:39.940 --> 06:44.695
HOW ABOUT JUST LIKE,
"JO, YOU WANNA GO TO
HOMECOMING WITH ME?"

06:44.695 --> 06:47.117
WHATEVER, MAN.
IT'S KIND OF A STUPID IDEA.

06:47.117 --> 06:49.870
IT JUST-- SHE SAID
SOME STUFF THE OTHER NIGHT
AT THE DINER.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.702
YOU SHOULDN'T
GIVE UP ON HER, MAN.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.034
ACTUALLY, I WAS
GIVING UP ON MYSELF.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.166
- NO, DON'T.
REALLY. SERIOUSLY.
- OH. OKAY.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.998
SHE'S-- SHE'S BEEN
THROUGH A LOT

06:57.998 --> 07:00.541
AND SHE KINDA DESERVES
SOMETHING GOOD IN HER LIFE.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.923
MAYBE THAT COULD BE YOU.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.680
( school bell rings )

07:13.514 --> 07:15.606
- HEY, RICO.
- HEY, ANDIE.

07:15.606 --> 07:18.188
I WANTED TO TRY AND CATCH YOU
AFTER MATHLETE PRACTICE, BUT--

07:18.188 --> 07:21.231
- OH, WE HAVE IT TOMORROW.
- I KNOW. I JUST WAS
SO IMPRESSED

07:21.231 --> 07:23.524
WITH HOW YOU HANDLED THOSE
IMAGINARY NUMBER PROBLEMS.

07:23.524 --> 07:25.405
IT'S SUCH
A TRIPPY SUBJECT, RIGHT?

07:25.405 --> 07:27.568
UH, YEAH, I GUESS.

07:27.568 --> 07:30.370
I MEAN, WHO'S TO SAY
WHAT'S IMAGINARY?

07:30.370 --> 07:33.073
EVEN REAL NUMBERS ARE
JUST CONCEPTUAL SUBSTITUTES

07:33.073 --> 07:35.786
FOR ACTUAL QUANTITIES,
DON'T YOU THINK?

07:35.786 --> 07:38.919
I DON'T-- LOOK,
I REALLY DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

07:38.919 --> 07:40.040
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

07:41.421 --> 07:43.634
HEY, SO LISTEN,
ABOUT HOMECOMING--

07:43.634 --> 07:45.966
- I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
- WOW, I DON'T EVEN GET TO--

07:45.966 --> 07:48.258
- ARE YOU PISSED?
- WHY WOULD I BE PISSED?

07:48.258 --> 07:50.971
WELL, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
ON A LAMENESS SCALE

07:50.971 --> 07:53.393
FROM ONE TO 10,
WE ALWAYS THOUGHT
HOMECOMING WAS AN 11...

07:53.393 --> 07:56.226
- YEAH?
- ...I MAY HAVE
KIND OF SIGNED US UP

07:56.226 --> 07:58.438
FOR HOMECOMING COMMITTEE,

07:58.438 --> 08:01.021
WHICH IS JUST DECORATING,
REFRESHMENTS AND CLEANUP,

08:01.021 --> 08:03.864
BUT ITS KIND OF
AN ALL-NIGHT THING, SO--

08:03.864 --> 08:05.866
HMM, ALL NIGHT,
YOU AND ME?

08:05.866 --> 08:07.908
YEAH, AND A BUNCH
OF OTHER LOSERS TOO.

08:07.908 --> 08:09.660
BUT I THOUGHT
IT COULD BE KINDA FUN.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.992
NO, YEAH, BETTER THAN HOW
WE SPENT LAST HOMECOMING,

08:11.992 --> 08:13.453
SITTING AT HOME,
WATCHING MOVIES.

08:13.453 --> 08:17.037
JUST KIND OF
NOT THAT INTO HANGING OUT
AT HOME RIGHT NOW, SO...

08:18.539 --> 08:20.541
- ( thudding )
- Man on TV: NYMN-10 live,

08:20.541 --> 08:23.003
outside of the Green Grove
police department.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.005
Thank you all for coming.
We really do need

08:25.005 --> 08:26.887
the public's help in this.

08:26.887 --> 08:28.839
Vikram Desai is
a person of interest

08:28.839 --> 08:30.931
in a murder investigation
and anyone who has

08:30.931 --> 08:32.763
any information
on his whereabouts

08:32.763 --> 08:34.344
should come forward
immediately

08:34.344 --> 08:35.686
and assist us
in this manhunt.

08:35.686 --> 08:37.768
One way or another,
we will find him.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.600
Man:
Chief, what can you tell us

08:39.600 --> 08:41.271
about Mr. Desai's
involvement in the--

08:41.271 --> 08:43.063
Kyle:
I'm afraid it's
an active investigation.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.605
I can't talk
about that right now.

08:44.605 --> 08:46.607
( man continues speaking )

08:53.914 --> 08:55.996
( chattering )

08:57.457 --> 08:58.789
- ( both grunt )
- YOU OKAY?

08:58.789 --> 09:01.421
- YEAH. SORRY.
- OKAY.

09:01.421 --> 09:03.794
- BUT YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.086
- I'M LATE FOR PRACTICE.
I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE.
- IT'S NOT THAT.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.429
SO YOU SAID NO, HUH?

09:09.429 --> 09:12.222
WELL, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT HIM
TO ASK YOU, ANYWAY.

09:12.222 --> 09:15.015
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:16.226 --> 09:18.729
OH CRAP. UMM...

09:18.729 --> 09:22.022
RICO WAS PRACTICING
ASKING YOU TO HOMECOMING.

09:22.022 --> 09:26.146
- WHAT? LIKE AS A DATE?
- LIKE A DATE, YEAH.
LIKE A DATE.

09:26.146 --> 09:28.689
I HOPE YOU PICKED UP
A FEW GOOD POINTERS,

09:28.689 --> 09:30.400
BECAUSE NOW YOU NEED
TO GO ASK LACEY.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.953
WAIT. WHA-- WHAT? WHOA.

09:32.953 --> 09:35.826
WHY ARE YOU
PUSHING ME TOWARDS HER?

09:35.826 --> 09:38.328
A COUPLE
OF DAYS AGO, YOU--

09:39.329 --> 09:41.001
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED NOW.

09:41.001 --> 09:43.043
I MEAN, AFTER WHAT
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH--

09:43.043 --> 09:46.126
EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
WHICH IS WHY ME AND LACEY--

09:46.126 --> 09:48.468
WE'D NEVER WORK, NOT NOW.

09:48.468 --> 09:51.011
- WHY? YOU GUYS ARE JUST--
- WHY? HOW CAN I HAVE

09:51.011 --> 09:54.014
A REAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOMEONE WITH
A SECRET BETWEEN US?

09:54.014 --> 09:56.266
DANNY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

09:56.266 --> 09:57.928
- WE AGREED--
- NO, YOU AGREED.

09:58.979 --> 10:00.220
OKAY, I'M TRYING.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.102
I'M TRYING TO ACT NORMAL.

10:03.814 --> 10:05.145
YOU DON'T THINK
I WOULD LOVE TO GO
TO HOMECOMING?

10:05.145 --> 10:06.817
- SO GO.
- I CAN'T.

10:06.817 --> 10:09.690
I DON'T-- I DON'T GET
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

10:10.821 --> 10:12.402
SO THAT'S IT?

10:12.402 --> 10:14.905
THAT'S WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

10:14.905 --> 10:17.998
NEVER GONNA HAVE
A REAL CONNECTION WITH ANYONE,

10:17.998 --> 10:19.950
NEVER GONNA HAVE ANY SEMBLANCE
OF REAL HAPPINESS?

10:19.950 --> 10:21.161
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

10:21.161 --> 10:23.834
JO, LOOK, RICO REALLY
LIKES YOU, OKAY?

10:23.834 --> 10:26.506
LIKE A LOT,
AND YOU KEEP ON
PUSHING HIM AWAY.

10:26.506 --> 10:28.839
- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T LIKE HIM

10:28.839 --> 10:30.841
THE WAY THAT
YOU CLEARLY LIKE LACEY.

10:30.841 --> 10:32.052
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

10:32.052 --> 10:33.804
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE JUST
PUNISHING YOURSELF FOR NO REASON

10:33.804 --> 10:35.926
WELL, MAYBE AFTER
WHAT WE DID,
I SHOULD BE.

10:36.847 --> 10:39.019
- JO.
- DANNY...

10:45.816 --> 10:47.357
CAN YOU GO IN CLOSER,
SHARPEN IT UP?

10:47.357 --> 10:48.358
ALREADY ON IT.

10:48.358 --> 10:49.569
LET'S SEE IT AGAIN.

10:49.569 --> 10:50.570
( mouse clicks )

10:54.074 --> 10:55.826
IT'S VIKRAM.

10:55.826 --> 10:58.078
WE HAVE PROOF
HE WAS HERE TWO DAYS AGO.

10:58.078 --> 10:59.830
WE ARE SO CLOSE.

10:59.830 --> 11:03.243
THAT'S AMAZING.
I JUST CAME BY
TO BRING YOU DINNER

11:03.243 --> 11:05.455
IN CASE YOU DECIDED
TO WORK LATE AGAIN.

11:06.456 --> 11:08.168
BEST WIFE EVER.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.960
GO THROUGH THE REST
OF THE FOOTAGE,

11:09.960 --> 11:11.882
ORGANIZE A CANVAS
OF THE AREA.

11:11.882 --> 11:13.553
MAYBE VIKRAM WAS
MEETING WITH SOMEONE.

11:13.553 --> 11:14.965
MAYBE THERE'S A WITNESS.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.888
- COME ON!
- ( chattering )

11:24.354 --> 11:26.897
( scattered clapping )

11:28.518 --> 11:31.271
NICE ASSIST.
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

11:31.271 --> 11:34.024
- YOU MUST'VE HAD
AN AWESOME TEAM.
- UH, YEAH.

11:34.024 --> 11:35.866
YEAH, IT WAS--
IT WAS UPSTATE.

11:35.866 --> 11:38.779
Coach:
OKAY, THAT'S IT, EVERYBODY.
NICE WORK.

11:38.779 --> 11:40.280
DESAI, I NEED A MINUTE.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.082
YEAH. EVERYTHING COOL?

11:42.082 --> 11:44.825
LOOK, I'M NEW HERE
AND I DON'T KNOW
ALL THE POLITICS,

11:44.825 --> 11:47.707
BUT YOU'RE A GREAT PLAYER
AND I'M MOVING YOU INTO
THE STARTING LINE.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.750
OKAY, THANKS.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.211
TRY TO CONTROL YOURSELF.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.094
I'M SORRY.
I'LL WORK HARD, OKAY?

11:54.094 --> 11:55.836
- YOU ALREADY DESERVE IT.
- ( clears throat )

11:57.387 --> 11:59.049
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING, HUH?

11:59.049 --> 12:02.933
I MEAN, JUST HAVING
A FIELD THAT DOESN'T BACK UP
ONTO A BARBED WIRE FENCE.

12:02.933 --> 12:05.055
YEAH, I THINK
PLAYING SOCCER IN JUVIE

12:05.055 --> 12:06.686
IS THE ONLY THING
THAT KEPT ME HALFWAY SANE.

12:06.686 --> 12:09.109
HALFWAY, RIGHT?

12:09.109 --> 12:12.652
( laughs )
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA PUSH
THINGS ON OUR FIRST DAY,

12:12.652 --> 12:15.856
- BUT I--
- IT'S FINE.
WHAT IS IT?

12:17.317 --> 12:18.989
YOU AND LACEY ARE
JUST FRIENDS, RIGHT?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.280
I MEAN, I KNOW
SHE'S PRETTY INTO YOU

12:20.280 --> 12:22.572
AND SHE DID ALL THAT WORK,
CLEARING YOUR NAME,

12:22.572 --> 12:26.787
BUT I SAW YOU GUYS
TOGETHER AND I DIDN'T
REALLY GET A VIBE AT ALL.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.000
WELL, IT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED
AND I'M NOT REALLY IN THE RIGHT
HEADSPACE TO KINDA--

12:30.000 --> 12:32.502
COOL. THAT'S GREAT,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.584
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK
SHE'S KINDA AWESOME

12:34.584 --> 12:37.677
AND IF I'M NOT STEPPING
ON ANY TOES HERE,

12:37.677 --> 12:40.931
I WAS HOPING I COULD...
ASK HER TO HOMECOMING.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.975
YEAH, MAN, GO FOR IT.

12:44.975 --> 12:47.267
( chuckles )
ALL RIGHT.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.693
SO IT SHOULD BE
LIKE A SHIP'S BOW,

12:53.693 --> 12:55.655
YOU KNOW,
LIKE FULL-ON LEO AND KATE,

12:55.655 --> 12:58.448
LIKE ALL OF THOSE
OLD, OLD PICTURES.

12:58.448 --> 13:01.071
"TITANIC," "A NIGHT
TO REMEMBER." COME ON.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.034
HEY, MAYBE A LITERAL
INTERPRETATION

13:04.034 --> 13:05.495
OF THE 1958 FILM CLASSIC

13:05.495 --> 13:08.208
MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST
CELEBRATORY CHOICE.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.210
PEOPLE CELEBRATED
ON THE TITANIC.

13:10.210 --> 13:14.124
RIGHT, YEAH YEAH,
BEFORE THEY PLUNGED
TO THEIR ICY, PAINFUL DEATHS.

13:14.124 --> 13:17.177
HI, GUYS. I BROUGHT
SOME RECYCLED PAPER STREAMERS.

13:17.177 --> 13:19.049
NO REASON TO DESTROY
THE RAINFOREST

13:19.049 --> 13:20.800
JUST TO MAKE THE PLACE
LOOK PRETTY, RIGHT?

13:20.800 --> 13:24.885
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE SAYING
THAT THEY HAD PAPER STREAMERS
ON THE TITANIC.

13:24.885 --> 13:27.888
- RIGHT.
- WELL, HOW ABOUT
SOME LOCALLY-GROWN

13:27.888 --> 13:30.390
ORGANIC POTTED PLANTS?
MY MOM RUNS A FLOWER SHOP,

13:30.390 --> 13:32.812
SO EVEN THE IMPORTED STUFF
IS FAIR TRADE.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.524
THAT'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY GREAT IDEA.

13:34.524 --> 13:36.276
THANKS.

13:36.276 --> 13:38.778
YEAH, I'M NOT JUST
INTO MATH,

13:38.778 --> 13:41.151
I'M ALSO SUPER
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.

13:41.151 --> 13:44.114
WELL, SAVING IT,
YOU KNOW.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.947
EXCEPT GLOBAL WARMING
IS JUST A LIBERAL MEDIA
CONSPIRACY, RIGHT?

13:46.947 --> 13:49.619
- RIGHT? ( chuckles )
- MMM, NOT REALLY.

13:49.619 --> 13:51.581
- IT'S KIND OF--
- I WAS-- I WAS JOKING.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.293
THAT WAS A--
IT WAS A JOKE.

13:53.293 --> 13:56.716
- NOT A VERY FUNNY ONE, BUT--
- NO, IT WAS.

13:56.716 --> 14:01.131
- ( stammers )
- LAUGHING ON THE INSIDE?
SORRY. ( mutters )

14:01.131 --> 14:02.172
( clears throat )

14:05.135 --> 14:07.807
ARE YOU OKAY?
COME HERE.

14:07.807 --> 14:09.970
I'M SUCH A DORK.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.062
I ONLY JOINED
THE HOMECOMING COMMITTEE

14:12.062 --> 14:14.064
SO I COULD SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HIM.

14:14.064 --> 14:16.856
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
WHEN I SAW HIS NAME
ON THE LIST.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.980
YEAH, I MAY HAVE KIND OF--
THAT WAS-- I DID THAT.

14:19.980 --> 14:23.073
- THAT WAS ME.
- WELL, I'M GLAD YOU DID,

14:23.073 --> 14:27.157
BUT NOW THAT I'M HERE,
I'M JUST MAKING A TOTAL
FOOL OF MYSELF.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.751
RICO HAS THAT AFFECT
ON A LOT OF GIRLS, RIGHT?

14:31.751 --> 14:33.753
YEAH.

14:33.753 --> 14:35.415
RIGHT.

14:35.415 --> 14:37.207
Jack:
YOU CAN AT LEAST
OFFER ME A CUP OF COFFEE.

14:37.207 --> 14:40.921
( stammers )
JACK, THERE'S A REASON WHY
I DIDN'T RETURN YOUR CALLS.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.923
YES, I KNOW.
YOU'RE VERY TOUGH.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.595
- OKAY, AND YOU ARE--
- HANDSOME? CHARMING?

14:45.595 --> 14:50.060
- I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME.
- YES, BUT YOU CAN'T COME
OVER HERE UNANNOUNCED.

14:50.060 --> 14:51.511
DANNY CAN COME HOME
ANY SECOND,

14:51.511 --> 14:53.273
AND I NEED TO FOCUS
ON HIM RIGHT NOW,

14:53.273 --> 14:55.105
MAKE SURE HE HAS
A NORMAL LIFE, YOU KNOW?

14:55.105 --> 14:58.318
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT KIND OF LIFE
DO YOU GET?

14:58.318 --> 15:00.941
BECAUSE I THINK
IT SHOULD START
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

15:09.119 --> 15:09.909
MOM.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.664
DANNY, YOU REMEMBER
JACK TAYLOR.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.376
HE USED TO WORK
FOR YOUR FATHER.

15:16.376 --> 15:19.129
YEAH, YOU TOOK US SAILING
WITH YOUR... DAUGHTER?

15:19.129 --> 15:20.750
- WHITNEY, THAT'S RIGHT.
- RIGHT.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.922
- OH, THOSE WERE GOOD TIMES.
- IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

15:24.384 --> 15:25.715
MM-HMM.

15:28.048 --> 15:29.469
YEAH, I'M GONNA GET GOING.

15:30.890 --> 15:33.183
THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID,
AND YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOM.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.314
OH, I WILL, MAN.

15:40.060 --> 15:43.023
WELL, YOU MUST BE STARVING,
SO I WILL START DINNER.

15:52.072 --> 15:53.703
( clatters )

15:55.125 --> 15:56.786
I SAW YOU OUT THERE.

15:56.786 --> 15:59.629
- YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.
- I'M REALLY OUT OF PRACTICE.

15:59.629 --> 16:01.841
REGINA WAS ALWAYS THE ONE
WHO KEPT US ON POINT.

16:01.841 --> 16:04.384
( sighs )

16:04.384 --> 16:07.137
- DON'T DO THAT.
- DO WHAT?

16:07.137 --> 16:08.848
BRING UP SOMETHING SAD.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.053
SEE, IT'S JUST GONNA
MAKE ME LOOK LIKE AN ASS

16:13.053 --> 16:15.725
WHEN I TRY
AND CHANGE THE SUBJECT

16:15.725 --> 16:17.647
AND ASK YOU TO HOMECOMING.

16:17.647 --> 16:19.769
( laughs )
WAIT WAIT. WHAT?

16:19.769 --> 16:22.102
YOU AND ME,
"A NIGHT TO REMEMBER"--

16:22.102 --> 16:23.813
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

16:25.025 --> 16:29.159
WOW. CHARLIE,
I'M REALLY FLATTERED,

16:29.159 --> 16:31.951
BUT I-- I THINK I'M--

16:31.951 --> 16:34.324
I THINK I'M ALREADY GOING
WITH SOMEBODY, THOUGH.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.378
WHO? DANNY?

16:38.378 --> 16:39.919
YEAH.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.962
'CAUSE I SPOKE TO HIM

16:42.962 --> 16:44.544
AND HE SAID THAT YOU TWO
WEREN'T GOING TOGETHER.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.180
WHAT? WHAT DID HE SAY?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.183
( sighs )

16:54.434 --> 16:57.267
YOU KNOW, FORGET IT.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.060
I-- I SHOULDN'T HAVE--

17:00.060 --> 17:02.102
WHAT DID HE SAY,
CHARLIE?

17:06.406 --> 17:09.279
HE-- HE TOLD ME
TO ASK YOU.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.701
HE SAID, "GO FOR IT."

17:19.119 --> 17:20.120
Karen:
HOW'S YOUR HAND?

17:21.961 --> 17:23.423
IT'S BETTER.

17:25.665 --> 17:27.467
SO JACK TAYLOR, HUH?

17:27.467 --> 17:29.549
WHAT, ARE YOU DATING NOW?

17:29.549 --> 17:32.432
( scoffs )
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

17:33.513 --> 17:35.935
I... WENT TO SEE HIM

17:35.935 --> 17:39.179
WHEN YOU WERE...
ON THE RUN,

17:39.179 --> 17:41.521
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO GO TO.

17:41.521 --> 17:44.774
BUT NOW IT SEEMS
TO HAVE GIVEN HIM
THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

17:44.774 --> 17:46.486
WELL, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
A REASON YOU WENT TO HIM.

17:46.486 --> 17:48.608
YOU FELT LIKE
YOU COULD TRUST HIM.

17:50.450 --> 17:53.823
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S--

17:53.823 --> 17:55.825
THERE'S A LOT
OF HISTORY BETWEEN US.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.407
HISTORY?
WHAT KIND OF HISTORY?

17:57.407 --> 17:59.199
( laughs )
DANNY.

17:59.199 --> 18:02.252
I CAN'T,
YOU KNOW?

18:03.543 --> 18:04.664
LOOK...

18:05.875 --> 18:07.377
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW, MOM,

18:07.377 --> 18:09.669
YOU DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY, OKAY?

18:11.421 --> 18:14.134
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE KNOW
WHAT A BAD GUY DAD WAS.

18:18.888 --> 18:21.351
I'M THE ONE WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING YOU.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.523
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN...

18:23.523 --> 18:25.185
KIND OF HELP EACH OTHER.

18:26.936 --> 18:30.490
( soft rock music playing )

18:30.490 --> 18:33.533
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
I WENT DOWN TO THE SHIPYARD,

18:33.533 --> 18:36.866
- ASKED AROUND.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH THAT?

18:36.866 --> 18:39.699
YOU SAID NAUTICAL.
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD

18:39.699 --> 18:42.041
BRAID IT AROUND A RAILING
FOR THE PHOTO BOOTH.

18:42.041 --> 18:46.085
- HOW MUCH DID THAT COST?
- OH NO, TOTALLY DONATED,
RECYCLED.

18:46.085 --> 18:49.209
- WOW. IMPRESSIVE.
- YEAH, IT'S AMAZING

18:49.209 --> 18:50.750
WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO GIVE AWAY.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.593
ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS ASK.

18:56.926 --> 18:58.598
( chuckles )

19:02.812 --> 19:05.225
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER?

19:05.225 --> 19:06.816
WHO, ANDIE?

19:08.067 --> 19:09.479
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S A TRIG GENIUS

19:09.479 --> 19:11.271
AND SHE'S DONE
A LOT OF RESEARCH
INTO NUMBER THEORY,

19:11.271 --> 19:14.364
- SO THAT COULD--
- NO, I MEAN, LIKE AS A GIRL.

19:14.364 --> 19:16.196
AS A GIRL?
I DON'T KNOW.

19:18.117 --> 19:19.779
I GUESS
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
OF HER AS A GIRL.

19:19.779 --> 19:21.491
I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY SHE'S A GIRL.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.122
SHE'S A GIRL WHO LIKES YOU,

19:23.122 --> 19:24.744
LIKE LIKES YOU, LIKES YOU.

19:24.744 --> 19:27.126
I THINK YOU SHOULD
ASK HER TO HOMECOMING.

19:28.628 --> 19:31.461
( laughs )
WHAT ABOUT-- WHAT ABOUT US,

19:31.461 --> 19:33.593
THE COMMITTEE,
REFRESHMENTS...

19:33.593 --> 19:35.555
- YEAH, BUT ALL OF THAT...
- ...THE CLEANUP AND EVERYTHING?

19:35.555 --> 19:38.888
...IS REALLY AN 11
ON THE LAMENESS SCALE.

19:38.888 --> 19:41.010
AND IF THERE'S
A CUTE, SMART GIRL

19:41.010 --> 19:42.722
WHO WANTS TO GO WITH YOU,
THEN YOU SHOULD

19:42.722 --> 19:45.605
DROP EVERYTHING,
INCLUDING ME, AND GO.

19:46.806 --> 19:48.568
I JUST THOUGHT
AFTER OUR TALK

19:48.568 --> 19:50.650
THE OTHER NIGHT
AT THE DINER,

19:50.650 --> 19:53.152
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT

19:53.152 --> 19:54.864
CUTE, SMART GIRL
WOULD BE YOU.

19:55.865 --> 19:57.697
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS--
I MEAN AS FRIENDS.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.370
- YOU KNOW? LIKE--
- RICO.

20:01.991 --> 20:03.583
YOU'RE AN AMAZING GUY

20:03.583 --> 20:07.036
AND YOU DESERVE
AN AMAZING GIRL.

20:07.036 --> 20:10.790
RIGHT NOW,
ANDIE SEEMS...

20:10.790 --> 20:13.042
A LOT MORE AMAZING
THAN I AM.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.218
GO.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.551
GO NOW.

20:21.551 --> 20:22.972
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

20:24.644 --> 20:26.346
YEAH. RIGHT.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.358
YES. YES.

20:44.574 --> 20:46.996
- ( fridge opens )
- Jack: I GOT BEER,

20:46.996 --> 20:50.370
BEER AND SOME
QUESTIONABLE O.J.

20:50.370 --> 20:51.871
JUST-- JUST WATER
IS FINE, MAN.

20:51.871 --> 20:54.464
I'M NOT USED
TO HAVING VISITORS.

20:55.635 --> 20:57.797
EXCEPT MY MOM WAS HERE
LAST WEEK, RIGHT?

21:00.550 --> 21:04.053
- SHE TELL YOU THAT?
- NO, BUT I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

21:04.053 --> 21:06.686
- ( chuckles )
- SOMETHING'S GOING ON
WITH YOU TWO.

21:06.686 --> 21:11.481
- LOOK, DANNY, THAT'S--
- NO, I REMEMBER YOU

21:11.481 --> 21:12.772
WORKING WITH MY DAD.

21:14.354 --> 21:16.896
- YOU GUYS
SEEMED PRETTY CLOSE.
- YEAH, WE WERE.

21:16.896 --> 21:19.859
AND THEN YOU JUST--
YOU JUST DISAPPEARED.

21:21.491 --> 21:23.242
DID MY MOM HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT?

21:23.242 --> 21:24.574
IT WAS MORE
OF A FALLING OUT
WITH YOUR DAD.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.407
WHAT KIND OF FALLING OUT?

21:27.407 --> 21:30.410
JACK, I'M JUST
TRYING TO FILL IN SOME
OF THE BLANKS WITH HIM,

21:30.410 --> 21:32.582
AND YOU KNEW HIM
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.375
YEAH, WE WERE CLOSE,
AND THEN WE WEREN'T.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.507
IN-BETWEEN'S A LONG STORY.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.685
YOU KNOW, I CARE
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER A LOT.

21:45.685 --> 21:47.847
I MEAN, TRUTH IS,
I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME.

21:47.847 --> 21:50.560
BUT WHAT SHE CARES ABOUT
RIGHT NOW IS YOU.

21:51.691 --> 21:54.524
- I KNOW.
- SO, HOW YOU DOING?

21:55.565 --> 21:57.437
FINDING YOUR WAY BACK
FORM JUVIE?

21:57.437 --> 22:00.780
I-- I LOST A LOT OF YEARS.

22:00.780 --> 22:02.442
YEAH, YOU TURNED 16
IN THERE, RIGHT?

22:02.442 --> 22:03.743
MM-HMM.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.036
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE?

22:07.036 --> 22:09.208
( laughs )
I DON'T KNOW.
NOTHING COOL.

22:11.541 --> 22:13.953
ACTUALLY, I...

22:13.953 --> 22:16.666
I HAVE AN OLD PORSCHE
IN MY GARAGE.

22:16.666 --> 22:18.798
ME AND MY DAD WERE
TALKING ABOUT FIXING IT UP.

22:18.798 --> 22:21.461
MAYBE, UM, I DON'T KNOW,

22:21.461 --> 22:23.593
YOU COULD--
YOU COULD COME OVER...

22:24.594 --> 22:25.675
TAKE A LOOK?

22:27.306 --> 22:29.809
YEAH. YEAH, MAYBE.

22:32.682 --> 22:36.566
HEY. LACEY, I GOT YOUR TEXT.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

22:39.318 --> 22:41.571
IT'S REALLY NOT. I...

22:43.322 --> 22:44.944
I MEAN, I JUST...

22:45.985 --> 22:47.577
I KNOW THAT
I MESSED UP BEFORE

22:47.577 --> 22:50.830
WHEN I WAS TOO EMBARRASSED
TO DATE YOU OUT IN THE OPEN.

22:50.830 --> 22:52.872
- LACEY, STOP, PLEASE.
- BUT I BLEW OFF
MY BITCHY FRIENDS

22:52.872 --> 22:54.624
AND I DID EVERYTHING
THAT I COULD

22:54.624 --> 22:56.836
TO PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE
SO YOU COULD COME HOME.

22:56.836 --> 23:00.049
- DOES NONE OF THAT MATTER?
- IT DOES MATTER.

23:00.049 --> 23:01.881
I'M VERY GRATEFUL.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.554
SO WHY DON'T YOU WANNA
BE WITH ME ANYMORE?

23:04.554 --> 23:07.136
I DO. I DO WANNA BE
WITH YOU, MORE THAN ANYTHING.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.429
OKAY, SO THEN WHAT?

23:09.429 --> 23:12.101
LACEY, I'M SORRY.
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:12.101 --> 23:14.774
BUT I DO.
WHAT YOU DID...

23:16.395 --> 23:19.479
TAKING THE BLAME FOR YOUR DAD,
STAYING SILENT,

23:19.479 --> 23:21.400
PROTECTING THE ONES
THAT YOU LOVE--

23:21.400 --> 23:24.694
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE REASON
WHY I... LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.907
I JUST WISH THAT
WE HAD NEVER MET...

23:28.948 --> 23:31.621
SO WE COULD
START FRESH, TODAY.

23:31.621 --> 23:34.033
EXCEPT WE CAN'T ERASE
THE FACT THAT WE'VE
KNOWN EACH OTHER

23:34.033 --> 23:37.627
SINCE STICKING FROGS
IN MRS. BROWER'S TOP DRAWER,

23:37.627 --> 23:39.589
AND I'M SORRY THAT THAT'S
NOT A GOOD THING TO YOU.

23:39.589 --> 23:43.002
- LACEY, CAN YOU--
JUST WAIT. JUST--
- WHAT?

23:45.595 --> 23:47.597
WOULD YOU PLEASE GO
TO HOMECOMING WITH ME?

23:49.308 --> 23:51.641
NO, I CAN'T GO
WITH YOU NOW.

23:51.641 --> 23:54.514
- I'VE FORCED YOU INTO IT.
- I WOULD LOVE TO GO WITH YOU.

23:54.514 --> 23:56.476
LACEY, YOU HAVE
TO KNOW THAT.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.650
FINE, I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT 6:00.

24:06.025 --> 24:07.026
( door closes )

24:12.742 --> 24:15.074
DO YOU WANT TO GET READY
FOR HOMECOMING TOGETHER?

24:15.074 --> 24:17.497
UM, I'M JUST
ON THE COMMITTEE,

24:17.497 --> 24:21.080
SO IT'S JUST REFRESHMENTS
AND CLEANUP, SO I DON'T
REALLY NEED TO GET--

24:21.080 --> 24:23.082
OH COME ON. YOU NEVER KNOW
WHO MIGHT COME AROUND

24:23.082 --> 24:24.544
THE PUNCHBOWL
AND ASK YOU TO DANCE.

24:24.544 --> 24:26.886
- THAT'S SO TERRIFYING.
- IT'LL BE FUN,

24:28.297 --> 24:29.929
OKAY.

24:29.929 --> 24:32.261
SO YOU WANNA MAKE SURE
YOU PULL THIS CALIPER
STRAIGHT OUT.

24:32.261 --> 24:35.224
JACK. YOU'RE BACK.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.687
I-- I INVITED HIM.

24:37.687 --> 24:39.979
SURPRISE.
THOUGHT I'D HELP SEE

24:39.979 --> 24:42.361
IF I CAN GET THIS
OLD CLUNKER STARTED.

24:42.361 --> 24:44.524
IT'S GONNA TAKE
SOME TIME, YOU KNOW.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.777
I GOTTA GET SOME PARTS
AND THEN COME BACK.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.740
- MORE THAN ONCE.
- ( tool rattles )

24:50.740 --> 24:53.783
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A SHOWER? YOU GOTTA START
GETTING READY FOR HOMECOMING.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.204
OKAY.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.116
KEEP THE DOOR OPEN, KIDS.

24:57.116 --> 24:59.328
REMEMBER, ONE FOOT
ON THE FLOOR AT ALL TIMES.

24:59.328 --> 25:00.499
DANNY.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.214
LOOK.

25:06.966 --> 25:08.548
( clears throat )

25:08.548 --> 25:11.180
- OKAY.
- IT LOOKS NICE, DOESN'T IT?

25:20.349 --> 25:22.101
WHAT'S WRONG?

25:22.101 --> 25:23.603
NOTHING.

25:24.944 --> 25:26.485
WELL, IT'S JUST...

25:28.197 --> 25:29.859
THIS IS WHAT
IT WOULD BE LIKE...

25:30.860 --> 25:32.491
IF WE WERE STILL...

25:33.703 --> 25:36.155
OR IF WE HAD
STAYED FRIENDS,

25:36.155 --> 25:38.658
YOU KNOW, IF NOTHING
BAD HAD HAPPENED.

25:40.249 --> 25:41.250
( softly ) YEAH.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.295
JO, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

25:48.878 --> 25:50.760
ME TOO.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.261
( cellphone buzzes )

25:52.261 --> 25:55.765
YEAH, I GOTTA GO
PICK UP DANNY.

25:55.765 --> 25:57.887
HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU COME WITH US?

25:57.887 --> 26:00.269
- WE CAN ALL GO TOGETHER.
- NO.

26:00.269 --> 26:01.851
- THAT'S CRAZY. NO.
- WHAT?

26:01.851 --> 26:04.233
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE
GOING ON A DATE,

26:04.233 --> 26:06.816
WHICH IS AS IT SHOULD BE.

26:09.278 --> 26:11.821
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YES.

26:13.032 --> 26:14.403
I'M REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU GUYS.

26:16.365 --> 26:18.367
- ( hip-hop music playing )
- ( kids chattering )

26:24.373 --> 26:27.126
- Danny: WOW, THIS IS--
- PRETTY AMAZING, RIGHT?

26:27.126 --> 26:28.207
YEAH.

26:28.207 --> 26:30.129
LACEY, DANNY.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.924
- CHARLIE, LISTEN, I--
- OH, DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

26:34.924 --> 26:36.515
YOU TWO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

26:47.687 --> 26:50.900
HEY. COOL, GREAT.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.152
♪ Fun, fun, have some fun ♪

26:53.152 --> 26:56.615
♪ Fun, have some fun,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.157

on the guest list ♪

27:00.619 --> 27:02.331

27:02.331 --> 27:05.294
UH, YEAH, CAN WE--
CAN WE GO AGAIN?

27:05.294 --> 27:06.876
I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE I WAS...

27:06.876 --> 27:08.668
IN CHARACTER, EXACTLY.

27:10.299 --> 27:13.132
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS STAND THERE

27:13.132 --> 27:15.424
AND YOU GIVE LEO
A RUN FOR HIS MONEY.

27:19.428 --> 27:21.430
LEO AS IN...

27:21.430 --> 27:23.142
- LEO...?
- DiCAPRIO.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.435
THE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATED,
$20-MILLION-A-PICTURE...

27:26.435 --> 27:28.187
ENVIRONMENTAL GOD?

27:28.187 --> 27:30.609
YES. I MEAN...

27:30.609 --> 27:33.232
THAT'S HOW YOU LOOK
TO ME, AT LEAST.

27:34.443 --> 27:36.115
YOU ALWAYS HAVE.

27:37.737 --> 27:41.160
ANDIE, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THE ONLY REASON I ASKED YOU
THIS LATE--

27:41.160 --> 27:42.241
I'M SURE JO SAID SOMETHING.

27:43.282 --> 27:45.244
AND REALLY,
ALL I AM IS GRATEFUL,

27:45.244 --> 27:47.246
'CAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY

27:47.246 --> 27:48.497
ONE OF THE GREATEST NIGHTS
OF MY LIFE.

27:48.497 --> 27:51.290
OOH. UH...

27:52.671 --> 27:54.924
ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE
I'M GUESSING YOU'D RATHER

27:54.924 --> 27:57.847
BE HERE WITH HER
OR SOMEONE LIKE HER.

27:57.847 --> 28:01.140
JO? ANDIE,
TRUST ME, THIS IS...

28:02.972 --> 28:06.185
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE
OF THE GREATEST NIGHTS
OF MY LIFE, TOO.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.228
- ( giggles )
- UH, LETS...

28:09.228 --> 28:11.901
( music continues )

28:22.321 --> 28:23.322
HEY, CURLY.

28:24.663 --> 28:26.705
IT'S JO, RIGHT?

28:26.705 --> 28:29.328
( laughs ) YEAH.

28:29.328 --> 28:31.710
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT "CURLY."

28:31.710 --> 28:34.293
RIGHT. SORRY.

28:34.293 --> 28:37.336
I'M THE NEW GUY,
CHARLIE,

28:37.336 --> 28:40.009
I'M ON THE SOCCER TEAM
WITH DANNY,

28:40.009 --> 28:42.601
AND HE HAD
A LOT OF NICE THINGS
TO SAY ABOUT YOU,

28:42.601 --> 28:47.266
- SO I--
- YEAH? IN THE FIRST DAY
THAT HE'S BEEN BACK?

28:48.808 --> 28:51.941
YEAH, WELL, GUYS TALK,

28:51.941 --> 28:53.983
ESPECIALLY ABOUT
PRETTY GIRLS.

28:55.905 --> 28:58.357
SO IT WAS NICE...

28:58.357 --> 29:01.160
MEETING YOU, JO.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.741
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

29:07.536 --> 29:09.248
( clicking )

29:09.248 --> 29:13.212
SO, THE OLD LET-ME-HELP-YOU-
FIX-YOUR-CAR ROUTINE, HUH?

29:13.212 --> 29:14.423
DANNY CAME TO ME

29:15.714 --> 29:17.756
WELL, I WISH
HE WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.

29:19.298 --> 29:21.931
WELL, I THINK HE'S GOT
A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT HIS DAD.

29:21.931 --> 29:24.303
NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT
HIS EVERYTHING, BUT...

29:24.303 --> 29:25.975
( tool clatters )

29:25.975 --> 29:28.557
I THINK HE LIKES
HAVING A GUY AROUND.
THANK YOU.

29:30.099 --> 29:33.352
LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING FOR US.

29:33.352 --> 29:35.234
- IT'S NOTHING.
- OH.

29:35.234 --> 29:37.276
I WISH I HAD DONE
A LOT MORE A LONG TIME AGO.

29:39.358 --> 29:42.361
IT WAS
AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.

29:42.361 --> 29:44.904
- I WAS MARRIED, SO--
- AND YOU'RE NOT MARRIED NOW.

29:44.904 --> 29:46.996
WELL, THAT REMAINS
TO BE SEEN.

29:46.996 --> 29:49.498
AND IF VIKRAM IS ALIVE,

29:49.498 --> 29:52.791
WITH OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION,
WE'LL BE IN WORSE SHAPE
THEN EVER.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.123
WHY, WHAT IS-- WHY?

29:54.123 --> 29:56.545
I WAS WAITING FOR HIM
TO BE DECLARED LEGALLY DEAD,

29:56.545 --> 29:59.128
SO THAT I COULD CLAIM
HIS LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

29:59.128 --> 30:01.130
BECAUSE IT'S
THE ONLY MONEY WE'LL HAVE.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.221
HOW MUCH IS IT?

30:03.762 --> 30:06.305
SORRY. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED YOU THAT.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.476
THAT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

30:07.476 --> 30:09.348
I'LL TELL YOU.

30:10.349 --> 30:12.141
IT'S $10 MILLION.

30:15.274 --> 30:17.026
TO US.

30:17.026 --> 30:19.358
- ( clinks )
- THANKS FOR HANGING
IN WITH ME THERE, BABY.

30:19.358 --> 30:21.320
OF COURSE,
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND.

30:23.282 --> 30:24.743
I LOVE YOU.

30:24.743 --> 30:26.745
( cellphone ringing )

30:27.826 --> 30:30.910
SORRY. IT'S EDDIE.

30:30.910 --> 30:33.122
IT'S ABOUT FINDING VIKRAM.

30:34.213 --> 30:36.005
- GO AHEAD.
- ( beeps )

30:36.005 --> 30:38.457
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- I DID WHAT YOU ASKED.

30:38.457 --> 30:40.259
I COMBED
THROUGH THOSE PAPERS.

30:40.259 --> 30:41.760
I FOUND
ANOTHER NUMBER
FOR VIKRAM.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.264
WE GOT A COURT ORDER
AND WE HACKED INTO
THE VOICEMAIL.

30:45.264 --> 30:48.017
I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA WANNA HEAR IT.

30:48.017 --> 30:51.180
- ABSOLUTELY.
- MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA WANNA
COME DOWN TO THE STATION.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.601
NO, I'M AT DINNER.

30:52.601 --> 30:55.144
JUST SEND THE MP3
TO MY PHONE.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.396
- CHIEF, I REALLY THINK YOU--
- Eddie.

30:57.396 --> 30:59.358
( chuckles )
JUST SEND ME THE DAMN FILE.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.820
- ( beeps )
- ( dial tone )

31:03.152 --> 31:04.743
EVERYTHING OKAY?

31:04.743 --> 31:06.655
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

31:09.828 --> 31:11.160
( cellphone chimes )

31:13.252 --> 31:15.204
( beeps )

31:15.204 --> 31:16.755
Tess's voice:
Vikram, Kyle's looking for you.

31:16.755 --> 31:18.257
He's determined
to find you.

31:18.257 --> 31:20.129
I'm so confused.

31:20.129 --> 31:22.551
I don't know what
to believe anymore,

31:22.551 --> 31:26.385
but I know one thing:
I can't keep doing this.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.308
No more lies,
no more secrets.

31:29.308 --> 31:32.181
You have to
turn yourself in.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.150
KYLE. PLEASE!

31:41.150 --> 31:43.402
WHAT'S WRONG?

31:43.402 --> 31:44.443
HAVE I BEEN
A GOOD HUSBAND TO YOU?

31:44.443 --> 31:46.445
YES, OF COURSE!
YOU'RE A GREAT HUSBAND.

31:46.445 --> 31:48.027
THEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'D LIE TO ME.

31:50.579 --> 31:52.081
YOU KNOW.

31:52.081 --> 31:54.243
I JUST HEARD
YOUR VOICEMAIL.

31:55.374 --> 31:57.496
ALL THIS TIME
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING,

31:57.496 --> 32:00.459
TRYING TO PROVE THAT
VIKRAM'S STILL ALIVE,
AND YOU KNEW HE WAS!

32:00.459 --> 32:02.131
YOU EVEN KNEW HOW
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM!

32:02.131 --> 32:04.463
BUT YOU NEVER THOUGHT
TO BRING ANY OF THAT TO ME?

32:04.463 --> 32:06.635
I DID THINK ABOUT IT,
A MILLION TIMES!

32:06.635 --> 32:07.636
I JUST...

32:11.760 --> 32:13.432
VIKRAM WAS THERE FOR ME

32:13.432 --> 32:16.265
AT A REALLY INTENSE TIME
OF MY LIFE AND--

32:16.265 --> 32:18.817
SO YOU PICKED HIM...
OVER ME...

32:18.817 --> 32:20.359
YOUR HUSBAND.

32:22.561 --> 32:23.942
WERE YOU SCREWING HIM TOO?

32:23.942 --> 32:26.195
NO. KYLE.

32:27.486 --> 32:30.369
VIKRAM TOLD ME SOMEONE
WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM,

32:30.369 --> 32:34.283
- AND THAT'S WHY
I HAD TO STAY SILENT.
- I'M THE CHIEF OF POLICE!

32:34.283 --> 32:35.374
IF SOMEONE WAS
TRYING TO KILL HIM,

32:35.374 --> 32:37.576
I'M EXACTLY THE GUY
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD!

32:37.576 --> 32:39.708
I'M SORRY.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.382
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:48.387 --> 32:50.469
- ( rock music playing )
- HEY.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.931
- HEY.
- LOOK, THIS IS--
I DON'T KNOW IF I--

32:52.931 --> 32:54.593
JUST A NORMAL
HIGH SCHOOL RITUAL

32:54.593 --> 32:56.225
WHICH SHOULD BE
NO MORE AGONIZING

32:56.225 --> 32:58.397
THAN YOUR
STANDARD FREAKSHOW.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.362
LOOK, I-- I ASKED
LACEY OUT, RIGHT?

33:03.362 --> 33:05.604
I GOT ALL DRESSED UP.
I JUST DON'T KNOW

33:05.604 --> 33:08.237
- IF I CAN FAKE THIS.
- JUST...

33:09.658 --> 33:11.740
JUST TRY
AND FORGET, OKAY?

33:12.871 --> 33:14.703
I'M NEVER GONNA
BE ABLE TO FORGET, JO.

33:15.664 --> 33:17.286
YOU KNOW THAT.

33:20.619 --> 33:23.582
HEY, CHARLIE,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

33:23.582 --> 33:25.794
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE WHOLE LACEY THING, OKAY?

33:25.794 --> 33:27.716
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

33:27.716 --> 33:31.130
I'M JUST GLAD
THAT YOU FINALLY
MANNED UP AND ASKED HER.

33:31.130 --> 33:33.132
( snorts )
NICE ONE.

33:33.132 --> 33:37.396
PLUS, I MEAN,
THERE SEEM TO BE PLENTY
OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN HERE.

33:37.396 --> 33:38.727
I THINK THAT
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

33:38.727 --> 33:41.350
- YEAH, I'M SURE
YOU WILL BE.
- HEY.

33:43.192 --> 33:44.483
GOTTA ASK.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.025
DO YOU EVER MISS IT?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.567
WHAT, JUVIE?

33:48.567 --> 33:50.699
I MEAN, THERE'S JUST--
THERE'S SO MUCH...

33:50.699 --> 33:52.491
OUT HERE.

33:53.412 --> 33:56.245
YEAH, THERE'S DEFINITELY
A LOT OF CHOICES.

33:57.496 --> 34:00.579
NO ONE TELLING US WHAT TO DO
OR LOCKING US UP AT NIGHT.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.622
MAYBE THAT WAS EASIER.

34:03.622 --> 34:05.544
MAYBE FOR YOU.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.006
WELL, HEY, I MEAN...

34:09.718 --> 34:11.430
I OWE YOU.

34:11.430 --> 34:13.512
NO, YOU DON'T.
WE BOTH OWE EACH OTHER.

34:13.512 --> 34:14.843
MAYBE.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.266
BUT YOU KEEPING QUIET...

34:18.267 --> 34:19.348
IT'S DOING ME A SOLID

34:19.348 --> 34:20.639
AND I HOPE
TO DO ONE RIGHT BACK.

34:26.145 --> 34:27.606
( soft rock music playing )

34:29.238 --> 34:31.110
D.J.:
GRAB YOUR DATE
AND SLOW IT DOWN.

♪ I've been ♪

34:35.244 --> 34:37.536
♪ Out on the open... ♪

34:37.536 --> 34:40.459
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TONIGHT. I HOPE--

34:40.459 --> 34:43.332
PLEASE, LACEY,
IT'S BEEN FUN. IT HAS.

34:43.332 --> 34:45.964
EVER SINCE I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL, THIS IS--

34:45.964 --> 34:48.046
THIS IS WHAT
I DREAMT OF.

34:48.046 --> 34:49.378
WHAT ARE-- WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:50.549 --> 34:54.133
UM, I KNOW--
I KNOW WE'RE ALL JUST...

34:54.133 --> 34:56.265
FRIENDS, SUPPOSEDLY.

34:56.265 --> 34:58.347
BUT THAT'S WHY,
WHEN YOU WENT AWAY,

34:58.347 --> 35:00.098
IT HURT SO MUCH.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.562
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE A KILLER.

35:03.562 --> 35:05.524
- LACEY, CAN I JUST--
- AND NOW I KNOW

35:05.524 --> 35:07.566
THAT I SHOULD'VE
JUST TRUSTED THE WAY
THAT I FELT ABOUT YOU.

35:08.777 --> 35:11.360
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS
YOU'RE NOT.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.572
- LACEY, JUST STOP.
PLEASE STOP.
- NO. NO.

35:13.572 --> 35:15.364
- YOU DON'T--
- I'M JUST SO SORRY,

35:15.364 --> 35:18.367
BECAUSE THE DANNY
I KNEW ISN'T CAPABLE
OF HURTING ANYONE.

35:18.367 --> 35:21.540
- THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.
- NO, I JUST NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND--

35:21.540 --> 35:24.793
LACEY, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, OKAY?

35:24.793 --> 35:27.546
OKAY, BOYS AND GIRLS,
IT'S THE MOMENT

35:27.546 --> 35:29.298
ALMOST NO ONE'S
BEEN WAITING FOR:

35:29.298 --> 35:32.421
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS YEAR'S
HOMECOMING KING AND QUEEN.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.923
IN A TOUCHING GESTURE,
THIS YEAR'S QUEEN

35:34.923 --> 35:39.137
IS POSTHUMOUSLY AWARDED
TO MY DEAR FRIEND
REGINA CRANE.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.519

35:44.973 --> 35:46.765
AND FOR HOMECOMING KING...

35:52.531 --> 35:54.112
IT'S DANNY DESAI.

35:54.112 --> 35:56.695
- ( cheers, applause )
- ( Lacey laughs )

35:59.868 --> 36:02.741
GO. YOU DESERVE THIS, GO.

36:02.741 --> 36:04.333
( murmuring )

36:09.668 --> 36:11.129
JUST AN F.Y.I.,

36:11.129 --> 36:13.212
NOT EVERYONE'S TEAM DANNY,

36:13.212 --> 36:15.844
SO ENJOY IT
WHILE IT LASTS, SOCIO.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.182
ALL OF YOU PEOPLE...

36:25.684 --> 36:28.146
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, OKAY?

36:28.146 --> 36:30.188
( murmuring )

36:30.188 --> 36:33.522
YOU VOTED FOR ME
BECAUSE YOU PITY ME,

36:33.522 --> 36:35.444
BECAUSE YOU FEEL BAD
ABOUT THE WAY YOU TREATED ME,

36:35.444 --> 36:37.576
BUT MAYBE I DESERVE
TO BE TREATED THAT WAY.

36:39.488 --> 36:43.031
MAYBE I'M EVERYTHING
YOU SAID I WAS BUT WORSE.

36:43.031 --> 36:45.033
- DANNY!
- MAYBE...

36:50.289 --> 36:51.630
TAKE THIS.
I DON'T WANT IT.

36:51.630 --> 36:53.462
GIVE IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.754
RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT
THE KING OF ANYTHING.

36:55.754 --> 36:57.175
( murmuring continues )

36:57.175 --> 36:59.388
DANNY. DANNY.

37:02.341 --> 37:06.555
- DANNY, WAIT.
- NO! I NEVER
SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU!

37:06.555 --> 37:09.017
- I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T--
- Lacey: WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

37:12.481 --> 37:16.024
RIGHT, RIGHT.
I KNOW, SO MUCH
HAS HAPPENED,

37:17.566 --> 37:20.359
BUT IT JUST FEELS
LIKE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO BE HAPPY.

37:20.359 --> 37:22.991
- LACEY, I'M SORRY, BUT I--
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANNA COME.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.284
I HAD TO PUSH YOU INTO IT,
AND NOW YOU'RE MISERABLE

37:25.284 --> 37:26.865
LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN
SINCE YOU GOT BACK
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

37:26.865 --> 37:29.167
- YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T WANNA TELL ME.
- I DO, I DO WANT--

37:29.167 --> 37:32.421
- IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME WITH YOU.
- I SH-- I'M-- I SHOULD GO.

37:32.421 --> 37:34.543
NO, YOU STAY.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.675
- LACEY, CAN YOU JUST PLEASE--
- YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.

37:36.675 --> 37:39.338
I LET YOU DRAG ME DOWN
FIVE YEARS AGO, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.312
( tool clatters )

37:58.317 --> 38:01.199
- YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING ALL NIGHT?
- ( sighs )

38:01.199 --> 38:04.403
NO, I TOOK
A LITTLE BREAK,
TALKED WITH YOUR MOM.

38:04.403 --> 38:06.455
IT'S BEEN
REALLY NICE CATCHING UP.

38:08.667 --> 38:09.998
HOW WAS HOMECOMING?

38:11.620 --> 38:13.211
A TOTAL BUST.

38:13.211 --> 38:16.084
I MADE AN ASS
OF MYSELF IN FRONT
OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

38:16.084 --> 38:18.837
- MADE MY DATE CRY.
- ( laughs )

38:20.218 --> 38:23.802
- OUCH.
- BUT I THINK
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I MADE

38:23.802 --> 38:27.265
WAS THINKING
I COULD GO TO THAT DANCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

38:27.265 --> 38:29.478
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

38:29.478 --> 38:31.019
NORMAL IS OVERRATED.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.232
( sighs )
TELL ME ABOUT THE GIRL.

38:34.232 --> 38:36.935
LACEY, YEAH.
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND.

38:36.935 --> 38:38.437
WE RECONNECTED
AFTER I GOT BACK,

38:38.437 --> 38:40.068
AND THINGS
KIND OF PROGRESSED.

38:41.239 --> 38:43.071
YOU KNOW, DANNY,

38:43.071 --> 38:46.154
EVERYBODY'S GONNA TELL YOU
TO PUT THE PAST BEHIND YOU,

38:46.154 --> 38:48.076
YOU KNOW?
FORGET ABOUT IT.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.788
LOCK IT UP IN SOME BOX.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.500
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.081
I'M SURE.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.545
YOU DO THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
LIKE YOUR DAD.

38:57.796 --> 39:01.460
IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED BEFORE,

39:01.460 --> 39:03.962
EVERYTHING THAT
SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM
HOW TO LIVE HIS LIFE,

39:03.962 --> 39:07.265
HOW TO TREAT YOUR MOM,
HOW TO TREAT YOU.

39:07.265 --> 39:09.388
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:11.099 --> 39:13.562
'CAUSE THE PAST
IS LIKE YOUR ROADMAP.

39:13.562 --> 39:16.024
I MEAN, KNOWING
WHO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE...

39:16.024 --> 39:19.738
THAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT
AS KNOWING WHO YOU ARE.

39:21.780 --> 39:22.941
( keys jingling )

39:24.903 --> 39:25.944
WHAT'S THIS?

39:27.325 --> 39:29.698
I THINK IT'S GONNA
HOLD UP FOR A NIGHT.

39:31.039 --> 39:33.912
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE THE GUY

39:33.912 --> 39:35.123
WHO LETS
A GREAT GIRL GET AWAY...

39:36.124 --> 39:37.125
AGAIN.

39:40.298 --> 39:43.301
SO, DANNY KINDA LOST IT, HUH?

39:43.301 --> 39:46.004
THAT GUY,
HE NEEDS TO LEARN HOW
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

39:46.004 --> 39:47.556
( scoffs )
YEAH, WELL...

39:48.967 --> 39:51.179
YOU DON'T KNOW DANNY.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

39:51.179 --> 39:53.562
YOU'RE RIGHT, I--
I DON'T KNOW DANNY.

39:54.723 --> 39:57.726
BUT THERE IS
ONE THING I KNOW.

39:59.187 --> 40:02.110
- YOU DON'T SMILE ENOUGH.
- REALLY?

40:02.110 --> 40:03.822
I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU ALL NIGHT

40:03.822 --> 40:05.614
AND I GOTTA ASK.

40:05.614 --> 40:08.076
WHY ARE YOU
SO SAD ALL THE TIME?

40:08.076 --> 40:11.079
- I'M NOT SAD.
- ( scoffs )

40:12.491 --> 40:14.913
EVEN IF I WERE SAD,
WHY WOULD I TELL YOU?

40:14.913 --> 40:16.084
I DON'T KNOW.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.837
JUST TO TELL SOMEONE?

40:19.838 --> 40:21.129
KEEPING SECRETS
CAN BE ROUGH.

40:22.671 --> 40:23.752
DANCE WITH ME.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.094
NO.

40:26.094 --> 40:28.887
THE DANCE IS OVER,
THE MUSIC'S OFF.

40:28.887 --> 40:30.098
WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU,

40:30.098 --> 40:33.812
I KEEP EVERYTHING
ON CLOUD THESE DAYS.

40:33.812 --> 40:37.816
- SO GET READY. HOW ABOUT--
- ( rock music playing )

40:37.816 --> 40:39.938
OH. OH.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.941
OH OH OH.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.943
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.
- ( laughing ) WHAT?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.485
- WHAT? WHAT?
- YOU'RE CRAZY.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.366
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?

40:48.366 --> 40:50.068
( grunts )

40:50.068 --> 40:52.120
AHA. SHE DOES SMILE.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.954
MAN, IT'S A NICE ONE.

41:07.676 --> 41:09.217
- I GOT YOUR TEXT.
- ( engine stops )

41:09.217 --> 41:12.050
- ( door opens, closes )
- WHAT-- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

41:12.050 --> 41:13.471
OH, IT'S MY NEW RIDE.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.724
DANNY, WHATEVER.
A NEW CAR ISN'T GOING
TO MAKE UP FOR...

41:22.360 --> 41:24.482
I WAS AN ASS, OKAY?

41:24.482 --> 41:26.064
AND I'M SORRY.

41:26.064 --> 41:27.315
I'M REALLY SORRY.

41:28.316 --> 41:29.658
OKAY.

41:29.658 --> 41:32.450
I KNOW YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME.

41:32.450 --> 41:34.573
- NO, I GET IT.
- YOU WANNA UNDERST--

41:34.573 --> 41:38.747
I-- SOMETIMES I WISH
I COULD FORGET EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED, TOO.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.459
- JUST WITH YOU, I WANT--
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

41:44.292 --> 41:45.584
OKAY.

41:47.586 --> 41:49.588
HELLO, I'M LACEY.

41:49.588 --> 41:51.089
- ( mouths )
- ( laughing )

41:51.089 --> 41:52.220
- COME ON.
- OKAY.

41:52.220 --> 41:54.012
HI, I'M DANNY.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.975
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M THE NEW KID.

41:56.975 --> 41:58.977
- OH. WELL--
- YEAH.

41:58.977 --> 42:00.559
WELL, WELCOME
TO GREEN GROVE.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.901
THIS IS--
THIS IS GREEN GROVE.

42:05.944 --> 42:08.146
( car approaches )

42:08.146 --> 42:10.859
( car door
opens, closes )

42:13.822 --> 42:17.115
DON'T. YOU ARE GONNA
COME DOWN TO THE STATION

42:17.115 --> 42:18.206
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

42:18.206 --> 42:19.788
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE
AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT

42:19.788 --> 42:21.289
AND YOU'RE GONNA
TELL US EVERYTHING.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.001
- MOM.
- ( cellphone rings )

42:24.292 --> 42:25.924
- ( beeps )
- WHAT?

42:28.546 --> 42:30.338
OH MY GOD.

42:32.591 --> 42:33.842
I'M ON MY WAY.

42:33.842 --> 42:36.094
- ( beeps )
- WHAT IS IT?

42:36.094 --> 42:38.136
THEY FOUND VIKRAM.

42:39.137 --> 42:40.558
HE'S DEAD.
