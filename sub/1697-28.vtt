WEBVTT

00:07.720 --> 00:09.590
Miley, what's wrong?

00:12.480 --> 00:15.350
-Did you get a D in Algebra?
-No.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.830
A D in Science?

00:19.440 --> 00:21.900
You saw your yearbook picture?

00:22.680 --> 00:24.910
No, l'm listening...

00:24.960 --> 00:27.670
What's wrong
with my yearbook picture?

00:28.440 --> 00:33.190
Nothing. lt's a sweet smile. lt says,
''l'm friendly, and l like spinach.''

00:34.600 --> 00:36.950
This is what l get for eating healthy.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.230
So what are you listening to?

00:39.280 --> 00:44.430
-Only the most romantic e-book ever.
-<i>Love Beyond Love: A Story Of Love</i> ?

00:45.600 --> 00:47.070
Did you get to the part
at the flea market

00:47.120 --> 00:50.510
where Chloe and Jacques both
reach for that romantic book of poetry?

00:50.560 --> 00:53.670
''Their hands just touched,
their eyes just met,

00:53.720 --> 00:55.230
-''and the air was filled...
-''And the air was filled...

00:55.280 --> 00:58.390
-''...with a thousand violins.''
-''...with a thousand violins.''

01:01.000 --> 01:03.510
Yeah, l saw
your yearbook picture, too, Stewart.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.070
So sad. That beautiful piece of spinach
surrounded by all that ugly.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.950
Yeah, well, l saw
your yearbook picture, too, Joannie.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.190
Looks just like you. Sorry.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.870
You really want to go there
with me, Truscott?

01:17.920 --> 01:19.350
Any day, Palumbo.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.620
Except Wednesdays. You've got piano.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.140
Except Wednesdays,
but any other day.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.870
l'm scared, Truscott.
Or should l say, Wimp-cott!

01:32.920 --> 01:36.030
l hate her so much
l name my boogers after her.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.670
You know, we should feel sorry for her.
A girl like that will never find love

01:40.720 --> 01:43.020
like Chloe did with Jacques.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.870
Sorry. Here.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.110
This is your poetry book.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.190
-No!
-No!

02:51.880 --> 02:54.550
-Well, sorry.
-l'm sorrier.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.510
l'm sorriest.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.670
This whole thing is sorry.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.950
-All right. Well, bye.
-Bye.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.310
-Bye.
-Hi.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.500
Hi.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.860
-Snap out of it!
-Snap out of it!

03:09.200 --> 03:10.470
What?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.710
She's evil.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.150
Yeah, and she's been that way
since the second grade.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.430
l loved that kite.

03:20.840 --> 03:25.510
l love my kite. l love my kite. l love...

03:25.560 --> 03:27.430
My kite!

03:30.680 --> 03:34.030
l love my balloon. l love my balloon. l...

03:34.080 --> 03:35.510
My balloon!

03:38.960 --> 03:41.150
No way you are dating that kite-cutting,

03:41.200 --> 03:44.070
balloon-popping
wart on a big monkey butt!

03:45.000 --> 03:47.150
Yeah, she's...

03:47.200 --> 03:50.710
You know when you go to
big monkey butt l can't top that.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.910
Anyway, you never
liked Joannie before. Why now?

03:54.960 --> 03:58.430
Well, l never really
looked into her eyes before.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.910
Those deep green...

04:00.960 --> 04:04.990
vats of mouldy, toxic fungus!
Those eyes?

04:06.720 --> 04:10.870
Please promise us
you won't ask her out. Please, quick!

04:10.920 --> 04:14.510
Okay, all right. Fine.
l won't ask her out.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.029
Good call.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.019
l picked up yours by mistake.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.670
-Do you want to go out?
-l'd love to.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.990
-l need to use the bathroom.
-No problem, kid. That'll be one dollar.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.870
But l don't have a dollar.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.540
You should've thought of that
before you had that extra-large drink.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.230
But you talked me into buying it.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.590
Did l?

04:49.280 --> 04:51.510
Hi, so what's good here?

04:53.080 --> 04:54.950
You're looking at it.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.950
And if you act right now,
l'll throw in a romantic evening

04:59.000 --> 05:01.630
and an order of macho nachos.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.670
Wow. Well, talk about your value meal.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.070
-l'm sorry. Did that actually work?
-No,

05:10.120 --> 05:13.550
but l've been watching you for a while
and l think you're cute.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.190
So when do l get
that evening of romance?

05:16.240 --> 05:18.950
Let me check my schedule.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.700
February, March, July...
How about tonight?

05:25.560 --> 05:27.230
What?

05:29.160 --> 05:32.030
Hey, Jackson.
l see you've met my cousin.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.030
Your cousin? She's your cousin.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.790
You are so funny.
l can't wait to see you tonight.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.230
-Oh, boy.
-l know.

05:45.280 --> 05:50.350
Cute, huh?
Except for that weird laugh. Annoying.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.630
Little bit.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.110
Okay, this is crazy. lt's almost noon,

05:58.160 --> 06:00.620
and we haven't heard anything
from Oliver about the date.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.950
Come on, Lilly.
We've just got to think positive.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.550
l mean, the date probably went awful,
and he ran away in screaming terror.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.230
Or it went great, and he's strolling
towards us, happily in love.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.830
Hey, guys.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.110
Come on, Big-O.
Let's go some place with a nicer view.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.750
Yeah, you better get her
off the beach, ''Big-O.''

06:21.800 --> 06:24.260
Didn't you read the signs?
No dogs allowed.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.790
-You want to go, Truscott?
-Bring it on, kite-cutter.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.790
Hey, hey.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.390
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.950
Listen, love-doodle,
you promised you'd be nice.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.950
-''Love-doodle''?
-''Love-doodle''?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.430
Let me take care of this.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.750
Go over to the boardwalk,
and get yourself a ceramic dolphin.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.950
-My treat.
-Thanks, Big-O.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.710
Okay, guys, you know what?
l really like her.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.150
Can't you at least try to be nice to her?
For me?

06:54.200 --> 06:57.310
Oliver, when you put it that way... No.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.900
-Some friends you are.
-Oliver, stop.

07:01.960 --> 07:06.230
Can't you just give it a shot?
lnvite her to a sleepover or something.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.830
Like we'd ever have a sleepover
with Joannie.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.990
Fine, we'll invite her.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.990
Girl-who-always-says-say-what
say what?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.950
l can't believe
you dragged me into this.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.670
Just remember that it's for Oliver.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.230
Fine. Look, l set up her sleeping bag.
Are you happy?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.830
A rubber snake?

07:35.400 --> 07:38.670
-Come on, Lilly. You're better than that.
-Yeah, l know. lt's real.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.270
Get that thing out of here!

07:40.320 --> 07:43.830
Look, l'll get rid of this snake
if you get rid of that one.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.190
Lilly.

07:46.440 --> 07:50.220
Fine. Come on, Wiggly.
You don't want to meet her anyway.

07:51.760 --> 07:55.350
-And here we are.
-Hey, guys.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.350
Remember,
my friends are your friends.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.630
-Whatever you say, honey.
-Okay.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.110
-Well, all right, bye.
-All right, bye.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.710
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.030
Bye.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.950
Let's get this over with.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.700
Good to see you, too, Joannie.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.670
-Lilly, say hi to Joannie.
-Whatever.

08:14.720 --> 08:18.950
So, this is just gonna be so much fun.
What do you girls want to do tonight?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.550
-Puke.
-Leave.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.670
Well, it can only go up from here.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.670
l can't believe this.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.710
Yeah, and l can't believe that
you and Rico are from the same...

08:33.760 --> 08:36.320
-Family?
-l was gonna say species.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.830
Okay, l'm really not that funny.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.190
-l mean it. Stop.
-Okay.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.390
Hey-oh!

08:56.800 --> 08:58.630
ls something wrong?

08:58.680 --> 09:02.030
No, it's just sand in my eye.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.030
Evil little grains of sand.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.390
Now where were we?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.750
l've been waiting
for this moment all night.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.510
Sorry, l have to poop.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.630
<i>And now, Milda</i>,
<i>it's your turn to travel with the pants</i>.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.880
Eat plasma, alien scum.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.340
-Will you keep it down, Palumbo?
-You keep it down, Truscott.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.830
Make me.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.710
You know,
l was thinking we could do something

09:42.760 --> 09:45.630
a little more slumber-partyish.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.950
How about a good old-fashioned
pillow fight?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.790
-Actually, l was thinking...
-Sounds good to me!

09:51.840 --> 09:54.430
Or we could play a board game.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.310
Or do our nails, or talk about Oliver.
Oliver.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.710
How we love that he... He...

10:03.640 --> 10:06.070
He is bringing us together.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.590
Just pick something.

10:21.200 --> 10:25.350
Now, Lillian, l am sure
there is a nicer way you could say that.

10:26.480 --> 10:31.420
You're right. Joannie, will you
please just pick something?

10:32.440 --> 10:34.070
Fine!

10:34.120 --> 10:37.190
<i>Life's what you make i</i> t

10:37.240 --> 10:40.150
How does she have a career?
She's terrible.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.150
Okay, it's official. l hate her, too.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.710
Now, Milian, l am sure there's
a nicer way you can say that.

10:51.760 --> 10:56.430
Look at that. Her big fat lips don't
even match that squeaky little voice.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.430
That's it.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.190
Yes, Oliver.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.190
-<i>How's it going</i> ?
-Great.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.990
<i>Then why aren't you sitting with her</i> ?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.870
How do you know that?

11:21.720 --> 11:24.280
-Go home.
-<i>Okay</i>.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.590
<i>l love you guys for trying</i>.
<i>You're the best. Bye</i>.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.070
What do we do now?
We can't be friends with her.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.710
We're doing this for Oliver.
The least we can do is fake it.

11:37.640 --> 11:38.780
Fine.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.270
Enough of this garbage.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.910
Hockey, yes.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.230
-l love hockey.
-You do?

11:48.080 --> 11:53.020
-Yeah, who doesn't like hockey?
-Yeah, Miley likey hockey.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.470
-Hey, is that Mario L'Chambeaux?
-Yeah. He's making another comeback.

11:58.520 --> 12:03.230
lf the guy gets any older, they're gonna
have to put blades on his walker.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.110
No kidding. Check it. Looks like
he had more face-lifts than face-offs.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.630
Yeah, l bet he's so old,
he, like, can't even shoot a touchdown.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.960
No, Joannie. We're 1 0,000 feet up.
Stop pushing!

12:29.920 --> 12:33.070
What? Stop... Where's my parachute?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.630
Joannie!

12:36.800 --> 12:39.990
-That was horrible.
-Don't worry, it was just a bad dream.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.750
l was talking about last night.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.910
ln my dream, l went ''splat,''
but at least l got away from Joannie.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.670
So, where is
the Wicked Witch of the West Coast?

12:48.720 --> 12:50.350
She's in the bathroom.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.430
Stealing soap, no doubt.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.060
So, good job with the hockey thing
last night.

12:58.120 --> 13:02.150
-Way to fake it.
-Yeah, about that.

13:02.200 --> 13:07.060
Somewhere between the hockey game
and the spitting contest,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.950
it stopped being fake.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.750
Girl-who-says-l-say-what say what?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.830
Well, first she wanted
to put your bra in the freezer,

13:17.880 --> 13:21.030
but l said, ''No, let's go out on the deck
and have a spitting contest instead.''

13:21.080 --> 13:22.630
Going to work.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.230
By the way,
it's a little slippery out there.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.390
What do you mean
you stopped faking?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.820
-What up, T-Cott?
-Yo, yo, P-Bo.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.340
Yo, yo... How long was l asleep?

13:41.120 --> 13:44.820
-Hey, what was that thud?
-Jackson took a dip in Lake Loogie.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.630
-Sweet.
-l know.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.030
You seem to have forgotten something.
We hate her.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.910
We did, but now, not so much.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.620
Hey, how'd it go?

14:00.800 --> 14:03.830
'Cause l don't know
'cause l wasn't here.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.910
We actually had fun,

14:06.960 --> 14:09.630
and Lilly's gonna play
in the pick-up hockey game today.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.830
-She is?
-You are?

14:12.240 --> 14:15.630
-Didn't l tell you that?
-See you at the rink, T-Cott.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.630
Sock it, lock it, put it in your pocket.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.350
This is so cool.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.630
Well, look at that.

14:26.680 --> 14:31.910
A room full of B-F-F-F-F-Fs.

14:33.560 --> 14:38.150
l hadn't seen that many ''F''s
since Jackson's last report card.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.430
Dang, l'm funny.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.190
Well, thanks T-Cott, l had a great time.
And, Miley, l...

14:45.240 --> 14:47.070
Well, bye.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.270
l'll see you at the game.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.190
You know, you can come
to the game, too, if you want.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.590
How could you do this to me?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.350
Miley, if you'd just
give Joannie a chance, you'll...

14:59.400 --> 15:02.670
Give her a chance?
She'd push me out of a plane.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.150
-You were dreaming.
-She would've done it.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.270
Well, can we talk about this later?

15:09.320 --> 15:13.150
l promised Joannie
l'd warm up with her before the game.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.420
Bye.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.550
Did you see that, Daddy?
They're all friends.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.150
Well, that's just wrong.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.630
Kids being friends,
doing stuff together?

15:27.360 --> 15:31.510
There ought to be a law against it.
A law, l tell you!

15:31.560 --> 15:35.230
l'm serious. They're already doing stuff
without me after a couple of days.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.230
Where's it gonna end?

15:37.960 --> 15:39.510
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!

15:39.640 --> 15:40.780
Get out of the way!

15:40.840 --> 15:42.990
-Out of the way!
-Guys, wait for me!

15:44.600 --> 15:46.510
Hey, y'all.
Do you guys want to hang out today?

15:46.560 --> 15:50.590
-No way, Milly.
-We got a hockey game today.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.910
l can't believe
you were friends with that loser.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.390
My name's Miley.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.630
Come on, Mile.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.870
Lilly and Oliver's
never gonna forget about you.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.110
You're right! They won't
'cause l'm not gonna let them.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.390
lf they want to play hockey,
l can hock it up with the best of them.

16:21.720 --> 16:22.750
Hey.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.830
-Jackson. You feeling better?
-Yeah. Yeah, l'm fine.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.030
Look, about last night.
lt wasn't really my stomach.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.150
The truth is, l've got this thing
with Rico and l just need...

16:35.560 --> 16:37.030
One sec.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.470
What?
No, Miley, l don't have a hockey stick.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.510
l don't know.
Try a sporting goods store or Canada.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.560
Hey, thanks for waxing my board.
l'll finish up.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.390
-Your board's in the back.
-Cool.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.190
l don't care. l'm busy. Bye-bye.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.060
-Man, it's getting worse.
-What's getting worse?

17:05.119 --> 17:06.710
Just don't talk.

17:06.760 --> 17:11.390
Please, l need to get over this,
and there's only one way to do that.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.740
Jackson, what are you...

17:14.880 --> 17:17.390
What l should've done last night.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.099
l really like you,
and this is gonna fix everything.

17:26.960 --> 17:31.470
-Jackson, what are you doing?
-l was going to ask the same question!

17:31.520 --> 17:34.080
This is not what it looks like.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.190
He said you were weird.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.070
lf this is your way
of trying to kiss up to the boss,

17:40.120 --> 17:41.910
it's not working.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.510
-Hey, Big-O.
-Hey, Jo-Jo.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.630
You know, you looked great out there.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.070
Nice outfit, Stewart.
Playing hockey or baking a cake?

18:12.120 --> 18:13.710
Good one, P-Bo.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.070
-Who's the dork?
-lt's Miley. Miley.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.990
Miley!

18:21.560 --> 18:25.790
You're here. That's great.
You look great.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.030
And l feel great, T-Cott.

18:28.840 --> 18:33.830
Get ready to sock it, lock it and rock it,
because this girl knows how to hock it.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.510
l got it in my mask.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.670
Miley, l'm really glad you're here,
but are you sure you wanna do this?

18:43.720 --> 18:47.030
Yeah. l mean, if you and Oliver
are gonna hang out with Joannie,

18:47.080 --> 18:48.270
so am l.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.910
But you stink at sports.

18:50.960 --> 18:55.110
Come on. Stop worrying.
Everything's going to be totally

18:56.440 --> 18:57.710
fine.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.990
Missed me, sucker.

19:10.440 --> 19:14.060
Nothing gets past the wall.
Nothing gets past the wall.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.430
Hey, l caught it.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.230
Daddy.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.270
l heard a ding. Are my brownies ready?

19:38.240 --> 19:41.830
Look, Miley.
Here comes Oliver with more ice.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.790
You remember Oliver.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.110
Are you feeling any better, Miley?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.070
No.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.430
l'm beat up,
l smell like a giant sweat sock,

19:55.480 --> 19:59.070
and ''P-Bo'' is stealing my best friends.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.710
What? What are you talking about?
She's not stealing anybody.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.710
But you're right about that sweat sock.
lt's a little stanky.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.510
Miley, do you really think
just because l kind of like Joannie now,

20:10.560 --> 20:12.790
it means l'm not gonna be
your best friend any more?

20:12.840 --> 20:15.910
Well, yeah, maybe a little.

20:15.960 --> 20:21.080
l mean, l thought l was losing you guys.
l wasn't thinking... l'm injured. Be nice!

20:22.600 --> 20:25.990
Miley, you're always gonna
be my best girl-bud.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.510
-Hey!
-One of my two best girl-buds.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.430
But l don't like your girlfriend.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.510
That's cool.
She doesn't like you, either.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.750
But you tried, and that means a lot.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.710
So, you don't care that l think
that she's a wart on a big monkey butt?

20:49.760 --> 20:52.790
-ls that okay if l use that now?
-All yours.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.070
Look, l'm dating someone
you don't like.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.630
Odds are that we're gonna date people
the other two can't stand.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.590
Yeah. You remember Josh?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.550
And Trey.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.390
-And Jake.
-Oh, my gosh.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.190
Guys, you made your point.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.640
Look, the important thing is,
we just have to trust

21:12.680 --> 21:15.870
that this is strong enough
to handle anything.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.670
You know, l could learn to like hockey.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.990
Hi, what's good here?

21:31.320 --> 21:32.910
You're looking at it.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.270
And if you act right now,
l'll throw in an evening of romance

21:36.320 --> 21:38.780
and an order of macho nachos.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.550
-You're cute.
-One sec.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.070
l can't believe that worked again.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.630
Hey, Jackson,
l see you've met my sister.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.070
Hey, hot stuff. Wanna go dancing?

21:56.080 --> 21:57.390
Go away!

21:58.720 --> 22:00.070
Excuse me?

22:00.120 --> 22:03.070
Miss me, miss me,
bet you want to kiss me.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.590
l would never kiss you!

22:06.640 --> 22:09.310
Fine. Kiss this, jerk.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.870
You are ruining my life!

22:18.880 --> 22:21.230
You say the sweetest things.
