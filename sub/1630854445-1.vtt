WEBVTT

00:35.994 --> 00:39.039
Mm. I could drown in this piña colada.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.208
And you know what?
That would be a great fuckin' death.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.209
Yeah, the best.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.463
-That guy just totally checked you out.
-Uh-uh. He was checking you out.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.423
Well, he kept running, so…

00:49.049 --> 00:51.801
-I guess we still got it.
-That's right. Uh!

00:51.885 --> 00:53.887
-Uh!

00:54.929 --> 00:56.514
Ben are we getting those massages?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.475
Did you say,
"Ben are we getting those massages?"

00:58.558 --> 01:00.393
-What? No, why? What?
-Yep, no, you said Ben.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.562
-Why would I say Ben?
-You said it instead of "when."

01:02.645 --> 01:05.648
-'Cause you are missing his Benis.
-His "Benis?"

01:05.732 --> 01:08.526
Because you can't stop thinking
about his Benis in your Bengina.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.737
-His penis, you mean?
-Yeah. You liked it.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.156
-Forget it.
-Oh, it's gross now?

01:13.239 --> 01:14.616
-Yes, it's-- eww.
-Oh, please.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.910
-Mm-hmm.
-Just-- just forget it.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.620
You can't forget it.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.333
Oh, my God.
Did you-- did you fly with that?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.376
-Have you met me?
-No!

01:25.460 --> 01:27.420
Hi! Jen Harding.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.923
-Larissa St. John.
-Oh, hello, Larissa.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.007
You sound dumb and rich.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.967
Oh, I am. That's my boat out there.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.553
-Ooh, lovely.
-Care to go on a cruise?

01:35.637 --> 01:38.473
No, I wanna stay right here.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.853
God, I-I can't believe we finally made it.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.896
I know.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.731
It's just--

01:47.357 --> 01:50.652
How did we-- how did we
even get through this year? Just--

01:51.820 --> 01:54.656
-I never thought that we could actually…
-Get away with it?

01:55.698 --> 01:57.492
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I know.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.577
But we did.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.246
Yep.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.583
-Maybe because we had each other.
<i>-Have.</i> Have each other.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.668
Have.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.715
-Mm.
-What? Look at this!

02:13.716 --> 02:14.717
Look.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.263
What a weird-looking shell.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.474
What the fuck?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.893
-Judy, this-- this isn't a shell.
-What is it?

02:26.312 --> 02:27.605
Mom?

02:27.689 --> 02:31.151
-Jen! Jen!

02:31.234 --> 02:33.361
-Judy!
-Jen!

02:33.444 --> 02:37.031
Jen! Jen! Jen.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.659
Jen!

03:04.726 --> 03:07.937
Why does everything hurt?
Why is there so much beeping?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.981
-We were in a really bad accident.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.317
Huh? On the boat?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.736
What? No, in Charlie's car.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.864
Someone ran your stop sign and hit us.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.365
-Who?
-We don't know.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.451
-They took off.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.369
Why did that happen?

03:23.453 --> 03:27.540
Another hit-and-run?
Is the universe really that uncreative?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.626
It does feel like
it kinda phoned this one in.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.377
-Or maybe it's for a reason.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.670
And we just don't know yet.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.214
Maybe we're just cursed.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.591
Or maybe we're blessed.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.928
You're alive, and I was really afraid
I was gonna lose you for a minute.

03:40.011 --> 03:40.970
There was so much blood.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.263
-You were unconscious.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.849
It was so scary.
God, I'm so happy you're okay.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.727
-God, maybe the hugging's gonna kill me.
-Oh, shit. Sorry, sorry.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.854
-It's okay. I love you.
-I love you too.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.691
Does Charlie know?

03:54.442 --> 03:56.694
No, but you should probably call him.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.114
Oh, God.
That kid has had such a hard year.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.952
The last thing he needs
is more drama on his birthday.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.541
<i>"Judy,</i>
<i>I don't know where to begin."</i>

04:10.625 --> 04:12.168
<i>"I just know this has to end."</i>

04:12.752 --> 04:14.712
<i>"You're a better mother</i>
<i>to Charlie and Henry</i>

04:14.796 --> 04:16.172
<i>than I could ever be."</i>

04:16.256 --> 04:19.384
<i>"I'm sorry I couldn't</i>
<i>forgive you sooner for Ted."</i>

04:19.467 --> 04:23.012
<i>"No matter what you think,</i>
<i>you've paid the price."</i>

04:23.096 --> 04:24.931
<i>"Now I need to do the same."</i>

04:26.933 --> 04:27.809
Fuck.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.781
Uh, hey, Ben.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.366
Hey, bud. Is your mom home?

04:43.449 --> 04:44.450
No.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.578
She… What-- what's going on, man?

04:47.662 --> 04:49.455
Hmm?

04:49.539 --> 04:53.710
You're really… bleedy. Are you okay?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.420
You're bleedy.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.337
All right.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.464
I'm great. Don't you worry about me.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.550
-I'm--
-Are-- are you sure?

05:00.633 --> 05:03.094
Yeah, no.
I'm good. I'm good. Hey, can you just…

05:04.262 --> 05:06.097
Can you just tell her I stopped by?

05:06.180 --> 05:08.516
Uh, yeah,
but you're fucking blitzed, dude.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.976
You shouldn't be driving.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.562
Oh, please don't be dead.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.398
Fuck me. Fuck me.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.941
Fuck me so hard.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.694
Where is the nurse?
Is this button just for show?

05:19.777 --> 05:22.071
You rang? Thirty times?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.573
Hmm, I don't think it was 30.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.866
I was rounding down.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.451
Well, she's in a lot of pain.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.286
Isn't there something you can give me?

05:28.369 --> 05:31.539
I can't just give out meds.
Doctor has to examine you and sign off.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.208
Okay, then can you get the fucking doctor?

05:34.292 --> 05:35.501
-Jen!
-What?

05:36.085 --> 05:40.256
-Can you please get the fucking doctor?
-I will do my fucking best.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.383
-Aww!
-Thank you.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.843
Fucking thank you!

05:45.553 --> 05:48.556
God. This is so stupid.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.893
I hate hospitals.
Nothing good ever happens in a hospital.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.270
Hmm. Babies are born here all the time.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.106
Then half of 'em grow up
to be assholes who don't vote.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.775
I think they're hesitant to give you meds

05:58.858 --> 06:01.319
because people come in here
and just lie to get drugs.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.614
So, what, they think
I faked a hit-and-run to get painkillers?

06:04.697 --> 06:05.990
Kind of a long con.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.867
-People love drugs.
-Hmm.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.287
-Did I…

06:11.371 --> 06:14.457
…ever tell you
that I had seizures as a kid?

06:14.540 --> 06:15.375
You did?

06:15.458 --> 06:18.586
No, but my mom would take me to the ER
and say that I did.

06:18.669 --> 06:21.672
-No.
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.549
And then she would make me fake one,

06:23.633 --> 06:27.762
and the nurses would come running in
'cause I could <i>really</i> fake a good seizure.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.597
-Brag.
-Terrible brag.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.848
And while I was convulsing,

06:30.932 --> 06:33.226
she would swipe the nurse's key
and go steal drugs.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.520
What an awful thing to do to a child.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.189
It wasn't that bad.
I'd get to go to McDonald's after.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.191
And then she'd pass out,
and I'd drive us home.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.360
Okay, that's, like,
the saddest story I've ever heard.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.278
Those are some
of my happier childhood memories.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.656
-Jesus. Ow! Don't make me laugh.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.199
Ow! Ow!

06:50.243 --> 06:54.664
Yeah, I… I spent a lot of time
in the hospital with my mom too.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.834
Not my happiest memories.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.918
I bet.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.548
Somehow it was my job to get her to eat.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.882
Just a…

07:04.966 --> 07:09.429
…delicious, steady diet
of Ensure and saltines.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.888
That's an Unhappy Meal.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.348
It was miserable.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.351
But it's all she could keep down.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.020
And then when she couldn't,
then I'd eat it,

07:18.104 --> 07:19.647
and then I wouldn't shit for a week.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.151
I think your story might be sadder.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.445
Well, let's just call it a tie, okay?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.448
-Okay.
-Can we please get the fuck out of here?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.575
Okay, hold on. I'll go find the doctor.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.911
All right, I'm gonna call Charlie,
let him know we're coming home.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.414
Okay.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.333
Oh, Jesus. Why--

07:39.917 --> 07:41.586
Why would--

07:41.669 --> 07:43.713
Why would someone put my phone…

07:43.796 --> 07:45.673
Jesus!

07:48.259 --> 07:50.219
My face recognition's not working.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.018
Man, I'm sorry
you gotta see me like this.

07:57.518 --> 08:01.147
Yeah, it's a real how-to
on how not to live your life.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.566
Whatever.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.985
It's not like you're the only
fucked up adult I know, right?

08:06.068 --> 08:09.906
Right.
Man, it's good to see you.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.117
I really missed you.
And I really missed your mom.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.785
What happened? Did you hit something?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.371
Uh, I…

08:17.455 --> 08:19.415
…don't really know.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.960
Well, what's the last thing you remember?

08:24.879 --> 08:27.215
<i>Hello? They did?</i>

08:27.298 --> 08:28.508
Are they sure?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.344
<i>Okay, thank you for letting us know.</i>

08:36.516 --> 08:37.642
My brother died.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.019
Oh, shit. How?

08:44.315 --> 08:46.859
We don't know. They f--

08:46.943 --> 08:49.904
They found his body in the woods.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.531
Jesus.

08:53.074 --> 08:53.950
I'm sorry.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.411
No. No, no, no. Please don't…

08:58.663 --> 09:03.459
Don't be sorry. I'm sorry.
That's-- that's no excuse for any of this.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.045
Hey.

09:06.754 --> 09:11.300
Uh, listen, I know this is… not, like,

09:11.384 --> 09:13.553
something you ever wanna hear
from a grown-up,

09:14.804 --> 09:18.307
but can you please
not tell anybody this happened?

09:18.391 --> 09:22.770
'Cause it could be
real Bad News Bears for me.

09:24.438 --> 09:28.025
-Yeah. A DUI is no joke.
-Yeah.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.194
Like, three of 'em
and you go to jail 25 years.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.991
-Twenty-five, huh?
-Yeah, it was just on my driver's test.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.660
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Good to know.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.705
Thank you.

09:40.788 --> 09:43.374
You're a good man,
Charlie Brown.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.960
Probably hate that. 

09:46.043 --> 09:48.879
My dad used to call me that.
I don't hate it.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.424
Well, I appreciate
you driving me home.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.176
I'm not taking you home.
I'm taking you to the hospital.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.388
-Uh, wait. What? No, no, no, no, no.

09:57.471 --> 10:00.850
No, no, no, you don't have to do that.
I'm-- I'm totally--

10:00.933 --> 10:03.519
-You can just drive me home.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.356
Look, nobody has to know
what happened today.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.691
Not even my mom.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.321
God knows she keeps
enough shit from me, right?

10:15.698 --> 10:18.826
Hey. Thanks, man.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.162
And how is your mom?

10:21.245 --> 10:24.540
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
-I'm so sorry.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.792
Tell me where it feels most tender.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.878
-Where I just said "ow!"
-Where she said "ow."

10:28.961 --> 10:31.088
Uh…

10:31.881 --> 10:34.550
-What are you looking for?
-Uh, come on, where did I, uh…

10:34.634 --> 10:37.637
-It's-- it's in your back pocket.
-It's in your back pocket.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.723
-There it is.
-Is there anything you can give her?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.850
-Not until we pinpoint the problem.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.353
The seatbelt could've broken her rib,
which would not be ideal.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.687
That could puncture a lung.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.065
-Oh, my God.
-And how are you doing?

10:49.148 --> 10:52.485
-Fine. A little sore. I chipped my tooth.
-What?

10:52.568 --> 10:55.696
Well, either way,
I have to send you both in for a CT scan.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.156
-Okay.
-That's okay.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.408
Well, it's a routine precaution
for a car accident, so…

10:59.492 --> 11:00.493
-Oh!

11:00.576 --> 11:03.496
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold tight. It might take a while.

11:03.579 --> 11:04.914
Crazy day.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.792
Okay, I'm not getting a CT scan.
Get the nurse 'cause I refuse it.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.918
What? Why?

11:09.001 --> 11:11.921
I don't wanna be here all day.
It's Charlie's birthday.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.715
He said you might have a punctured lung.
You need to get that scan.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.468
I don't want it. My body, my choice.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.345
-Always. But…
-Water?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.390
What if something is wrong?
Don't you wanna know?

11:22.473 --> 11:25.810
Look, if it's a broken rib,
there's nothing they can do.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.104
They can't put a tiny little cast on it.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.481
That would be adorable.
But what if it's something else?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.900
Exactly. It's always something else.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.278
Go in for one thing,
and the next thing you know,

11:36.362 --> 11:39.240
your kid is trying to force-feed you
saltines to keep you alive.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.492
It is not gonna be that.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.785
With the year I'm having?

11:43.869 --> 11:48.207
I-I just-- I can't take any more bad news.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.626
And we're sure this is Steve Wood?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.628
I mean, uh, the body's so, uh…

11:52.712 --> 11:55.423
You know, uh,
it kind of makes it hard to--

11:55.506 --> 11:56.882
Caucasian male, brown hair.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.385
Clothing matches the description
Mr. Wood was seen wearing.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.846
Odds are it's him. Or what's left of him.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.099
Jesus. That head wound.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.435
So, what do you think happened?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.979
I don't know.
I mean, I don't-- obviously, I don't know.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.065
I mean, Wood was in bed
with a bunch of shady characters.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.984
If I had to guess,
I'd say it was the Greeks.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.194
-Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
-Yeah? Yeah.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.199
-But it's a pretty shallow grave.
-Ehh.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.285
I'm surprised it took
someone this long to find him.

12:24.368 --> 12:28.706
Not really. I mean, it's a big place
and a lot of trees. You'd be surprised.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.959
There's a reason Angeles Forest
is a dumping ground for organized crime.

12:33.669 --> 12:36.672
-Yeah. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-True.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.385
Do Greeks usually carve a heart
where they dump their dead?

12:44.972 --> 12:45.973
I mean…

12:46.724 --> 12:48.559
It's probably just
a coincidence, you know.

12:48.642 --> 12:52.855
It-- it could've been a couple of lovers
making love under a tree,

12:52.938 --> 12:55.775
marking the tree
where the love they made was made.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.904
-Okay. Yeah. Uh…
-Yeah. Yeah.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.908
But it's basically
an arrow pointing right at him.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.999
Oh, shit. Come on.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.337
Ow! Ow! Ow! 

13:18.547 --> 13:20.883
-Fuck. Shoot.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.384
Hello?

13:22.468 --> 13:24.845
Tell me you did not
carve an arrow pointing directly--

13:24.929 --> 13:27.765
I-I'm sorry.
I can't-- I can't hear you. W-what?

13:29.099 --> 13:30.726
H-hello? Hello? I can't--

13:30.810 --> 13:32.728
<i>I cannot-- I can't hear you. Wh-what?</i>

13:32.812 --> 13:34.647
<i>-Can you move somewhere else?</i>
You move!

13:34.730 --> 13:37.650
I can't. Okay, so?
Your signal fucking sucks!

13:37.733 --> 13:40.778
Well, your signal sucks!
Just-- just can you…

13:40.861 --> 13:43.113
<i>-Hmm. I can't. What? What?</i>
-Can you-- can you hear me now?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.865
-<i>Can you hear me now?</i>
-Yes, yes, yes, yes.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.284
Stay right where you are. Don't move.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.371
-Stop talking. Listen.
<i>-Just fucking--</i>

13:50.454 --> 13:53.123
-They found-- Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.417
Hello? What-- what did they find?

13:57.378 --> 14:01.006
Yeah, that was the, uh, my Instacart.
The store doesn't have my yogurt.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.509
-Chobani? Of course.
-Chobani. That-- every time.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.718
-They're always out.
-Always.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.679
Hey, we should
get a statement from the witness.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.223
-What witness?
-Uh, the lady that found him.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.145
-I'm on it.
-Uh…

14:15.229 --> 14:17.815
-Well-- you sure?
-Yeah, I got it.

14:18.732 --> 14:19.900
-Hello.
-Hey.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.779
-Oh, I know you.
-No, you don't.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.906
-Yeah, I've seen you here before.
-No, you haven't.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.950
-With a blonde lady.
-Don't know any blonde ladies.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.118
Um…

14:34.707 --> 14:36.125
-You need to get that?
-No.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.042
Pick up. Pick up.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.670
Oh, fuck, fuck!

14:39.753 --> 14:41.797
Shit, shit, shit.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.885
-Shit. Shit.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.681
What is happening?

14:50.764 --> 14:51.932
Hi!

14:52.433 --> 14:54.018
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.730
I was, um-- uh, the doctor said
that I was gonna have a scan

14:57.813 --> 15:01.066
after my friend, and I-- I got eager.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.777
Eager beaver.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.655
Leave it to Beave'.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.948
I thought we had a runner.

15:08.032 --> 15:12.661
No, I was trying
to get a selfie 'cause this shit's funny.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.164
-Okay, here we go.
-Oh, it's time.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.582
Yeah, it's time.

15:16.665 --> 15:17.958
Ah, shit.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.387
-Looks like someone was partying too hard.
-Huh.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.305
What happened here?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.851
To be honest, I… don't really remember.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.102
Yeah, well, you're lucky.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.481
If you'd fallen an inch further,
you'd have broken that cute little nose.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.610
-You guys busy today?
-Oh, yeah.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.905
Couple of heart attacks,
toothbrush up the caboose.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.033
-Oof!
-Hit-and-run, stroke.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.827
-W-wait. Hit-and-run?
-Can you imagine?

16:01.043 --> 16:03.128
You okay, hon?
You're looking a little peaked.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.343
Saw that coming.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.638
Yeah, it's a tricky kitten.
You gotta double the bananas.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.682
-Seriously?
-Dead seriously.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.184
-The recipe calls for four. I put eight.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.104
Sometimes nine if they're small
'cause that's the sweet spot.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.107
-My bread always comes out dry.
-Oh.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.483
-You okay?
-Yeah, sorry.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.277
Sometimes I just
get a little lightheaded. Ooh.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.698
-Here, here. Take a seat.
-Oh. Ooh.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.284
Maybe it's my blood sugar.
I don't know.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.329
-Hmm.
-God, no, I hope it's not a seizure.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.708
I haven't had one in so long.
Maybe I'm just dehydrated.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.501
Can I get you some water? Or orange juice?

16:42.584 --> 16:44.294
Oh, juice would be great.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.505
-Don't move. I'll be right back.
-Thanks.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.089
-Oh.
-Here you go, honey.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.466
Thank you.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.926
-Mmm!

17:33.010 --> 17:34.762
Ah, it's so good. Thank you.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.765
-You're a lifesaver.
-Oh. Oh.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.185
You have such great eyebrows.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.227
Thanks.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.111
Just try to relax, okay?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.919
Take a deep breath.
Count to ten.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.844
No need to apologize.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.763
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.647
Please just go.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.947
You're finished.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.828
-That wasn't too bad, was it?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.386
-Hello?
-<i>Hello?</i>

18:57.469 --> 18:59.054
-Charlie?
<i>-Judy?</i>

19:00.347 --> 19:02.432
-Hello?
- <i>Ju-Ju-Judy?</i>

19:02.516 --> 19:03.892
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.061
-Hello? Shoot, I only have one bar.
-<i> Hi. Hi.</i>

19:06.145 --> 19:07.020
Charlie.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.273
Charlie!

19:09.356 --> 19:10.315
<i>Where's my mom?</i>

19:10.399 --> 19:13.610
Oh, she's been trying to reach you.
How's the birthday boy?

19:13.694 --> 19:15.988
-Cut the shit, Judy.
<i>-Okay. Um…</i>

19:17.030 --> 19:19.366
-Listen. Your mom and I were--
<i>-My mom and you what?</i>

19:19.992 --> 19:21.201
What the fuck did you do?

19:21.285 --> 19:23.662
Uh, that's a little hard
to answer out of context.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.540
I read the letter, Judy.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.584
What? Which letter?

19:28.667 --> 19:31.211
-What do you mean, "which letter?"
<i>-What do you mean?</i>

19:31.295 --> 19:32.504
-Fuck!

19:33.088 --> 19:34.131
Oh!

19:34.214 --> 19:35.340
-Judy!
-Ben!

19:35.424 --> 19:37.593
What are you doing? No, you go.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.428
-I was just getting some stitches.
-Oh.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.929
'Cause I-I fell…

19:41.013 --> 19:45.017
…on my face
'cause I tripped on my-- on my feet.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.186
Wait. Why--
what are you doing here?

19:47.269 --> 19:48.979
Uh…

19:49.605 --> 19:51.064
Jen and I were in a hit-and-run.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.524
What?

19:52.608 --> 19:55.694
Yeah, some driver just blew through
the stop sign and ran right into us.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.237
Oh, my God.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.330
Jen. Jen.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.295
It was really scary.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.798
Jen's… pretty banged up.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.009
-Is she gonna be okay?
-I don't know.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.053
I hope so.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.558
-Well, nothing's broken.
-Oh!

20:26.642 --> 20:28.852
Thank God. So, we can leave?

20:28.936 --> 20:29.811
Not just yet.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.812
Huh?

20:31.521 --> 20:33.315
I'm so sorry that happened.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.692
Thank you. Me too.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.197
Judy, I have to tell you something.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.742
Uh, and it's not good. It's bad. It's…

20:44.952 --> 20:45.953
It's really bad.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.664
We found something else.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.123
I'm sorry.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.292
We found shadows.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.421
What do you mean, "shadows?"
What-- what does that mean?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.716
It's okay. Well, you can tell me anything.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.634
What is it?

21:00.717 --> 21:02.844
They look like masses,

21:03.428 --> 21:06.056
but I'm not an oncologist,
so I really can't say.

21:06.139 --> 21:09.184
But we'll schedule you a follow-up
with a specialist immediately.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.687
God, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.106
-Uh…
-Ben, please just say it.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.608
-Yeah, uh…

21:16.692 --> 21:17.985
What?

21:19.820 --> 21:20.946
They found Steve.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.618
-Oh, my God.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.663
He's dead, Jude.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.543
Uh, I'm so…

21:35.961 --> 21:37.254
I'm so sorry.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.631
Yeah. No, oh, I'm sorry.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.468
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.221
No, no, don't be sorry.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.807
Do they know what happened?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.852
I mean, I can't say for sure.
It's just a scan…

21:51.935 --> 21:55.147
Yeah, no, I-I know what
"check with an oncologist" means, okay?

21:55.230 --> 21:57.024
My mom died of cancer.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.443
-That's, um-- I'm sorry.
-Mm-hmm.

21:59.526 --> 22:02.029
You should definitely do a follow-up.

22:03.447 --> 22:07.451
But you know, in my experience,
things aren't always what they seem.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.493
Mm-hmm.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.289
Again, I'm so sorry, Miss Hale.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.290
Hmm?

22:20.714 --> 22:23.592
I'll get you and your friend's
discharge papers ready.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.763
So, she's-- she's okay?

22:27.846 --> 22:30.015
Yeah. Just a couple bruised ribs.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.193
-Jen.
-Hi.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.528
-They found Steve.
-What?

22:43.612 --> 22:45.781
I just heard from Ben. A dog dug him up.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.701
Oh, for fuck's sake. Oh, my God. 

22:49.785 --> 22:51.370
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.497
Oh, shoot. Come on.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.418
-It's gonna be okay.
-I don't know about that.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.923
Did the doctor ever come?

23:03.006 --> 23:04.633
Um…

23:04.716 --> 23:07.844
Yeah, yeah. No, um, he said we could go.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.554
Wait, so you're all right?

23:09.638 --> 23:11.723
-Yeah, just bruised.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.851
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
Thank God. Thank God.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.399
-Here. Take this.
-What's--

23:21.650 --> 23:24.194
Jesus. Where did you get that?

23:24.277 --> 23:26.696
-My seizures came back.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.282
They were very sudden and perfectly timed.

23:31.618 --> 23:32.536
I love you.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.703
I love you.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.582
Listen,

23:38.542 --> 23:39.876
I know it's scary,

23:40.502 --> 23:42.838
but we've been through a lot already.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.301
We've had quite a year.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.262
And we survived because we had each other.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.681
No, we <i>have</i> each other.

23:52.764 --> 23:53.765
Yeah.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.062
-That was weird.
-What?

23:59.771 --> 24:03.150
I-I just got déjà vu.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.609
That's a good sign.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.530
I hope so.
