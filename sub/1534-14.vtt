00:01.461 --> 00:03.782
<i>Previously on Once Upon A Time...</i>

00:03.782 --> 00:07.221
Rumplestiltskin, I command
you to leave Storybrooke.

00:07.458 --> 00:08.995
- That looks like your book.
- It's blank.

00:08.995 --> 00:11.107
And if this place is full
of potential storybooks...

00:11.298 --> 00:12.465
This is the author's house.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.657
I was hoping he could
write me a happier story.

00:15.657 --> 00:16.353
I'm in.

00:16.521 --> 00:18.021
I learned the rules do apply to me.

00:18.055 --> 00:21.291
There's someone who can change
those rules... the author.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.459
_

00:33.537 --> 00:34.704
Uhh!

00:41.211 --> 00:42.578
Stop.

00:42.613 --> 00:45.114
Just who the hell might you be?

00:46.750 --> 00:50.319
Ursula. But you can call me your majesty.

00:50.353 --> 00:53.188
- I don't bow down to fish.
- Who are you?

00:53.223 --> 00:55.024
I'm the person whose valet
you either knocked out,

00:55.058 --> 00:56.758
strangled, or tried to impregnate.

00:56.792 --> 00:59.194
I don't know what those tentacles are for.

00:59.229 --> 01:01.763
I was invited here. What's your excuse?

01:01.797 --> 01:03.665
This is my home.

01:03.699 --> 01:05.200
So why did you send for me?

01:05.235 --> 01:07.569
Believe me, I did not send for you.

01:07.603 --> 01:10.672
Then what...

01:18.213 --> 01:19.714
I wouldn't do that.

01:21.617 --> 01:24.685
Don't worry. They don't eat fish or dragon.

01:25.954 --> 01:27.755
Unless I tell them to.

01:33.662 --> 01:37.365
Thank you, my darlings. A wonderful job.

01:37.399 --> 01:39.767
I'll take it from here.

01:39.801 --> 01:41.401
Now who's gonna tell me

01:41.436 --> 01:43.737
what in the hell I'm doing
in this ghastly place?

01:43.772 --> 01:47.641
Lovely question, because this
"ghastly place" is my home,

01:47.676 --> 01:49.443
and I didn't ask for any visitors.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.411
I received specific instructions.

01:51.446 --> 01:53.213
As did I. I don't care.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.214
You're trespassing.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.649
And do you know what I do with trespassers?

01:56.684 --> 01:58.751
Don't even think it. Now, now, ladies.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.620
Don't tear each other apart.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.823
I need you all in one piece
Or rather, three pieces.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.159
Rumplestiltskin. It was you.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.227
Guilty.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.662
Someone wanna tell me why
I left the sea for this?

02:09.697 --> 02:11.398
Oh, yes.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.466
The reason for this little
tête-à-tête-à-tête...

02:13.500 --> 02:14.667
À-tête...

02:14.702 --> 02:16.402
we all have something in common,

02:16.436 --> 02:18.771
apart from mutual distaste.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.106
We're villains.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.308
And it's time the villains

02:22.342 --> 02:24.343
got their happy endings.

03:06.852 --> 03:09.621
Now who can tell me what
the study of birds is called?

03:10.589 --> 03:11.822
Henry.

03:11.857 --> 03:13.158
Ornithology?

03:13.192 --> 03:14.725
Very good.

04:15.952 --> 04:17.820
Hey!

04:42.845 --> 04:45.980
Well, I see
you still have your temper.

04:46.014 --> 04:48.750
Six weeks and nothing.

04:48.784 --> 04:51.085
They're still trapped
inside that bloody hat.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.788
Look, we just
have to keep at it, okay?

04:53.822 --> 04:57.925
But we will find a spell
to release the fairies.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.794
I mean, these translations are difficult,

04:59.828 --> 05:03.164
but I've reached out to some of
the finest minds in the world,

05:03.198 --> 05:06.600
and one of them will get back to us.

05:06.635 --> 05:08.002
I know it.

05:08.036 --> 05:10.304
If we're reduced to those magic boxes,

05:10.338 --> 05:12.640
then I'd say hope is in short supply.

05:12.674 --> 05:15.776
They, uh... call it the Internet.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.278
And it can help us.

05:17.312 --> 05:21.282
And once we get the fairies out of the hat,

05:21.316 --> 05:22.816
they can help us release everyone else,

05:22.850 --> 05:25.753
including that poor old
man that you put in there.

05:25.787 --> 05:27.954
All because I left myself
be tricked by that crocodile.

05:29.524 --> 05:30.924
How could I have been so weak?

05:30.958 --> 05:35.028
Well... we both were.

05:35.062 --> 05:38.131
You know, Rumplestiltskin
got the best of us.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.033
And you're right.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.102
You... you should've been
stronger, but you weren't.

05:42.136 --> 05:45.605
And... Well, neither was I.

05:45.639 --> 05:47.940
You know, I...

05:47.974 --> 05:50.943
I should've seen through him.

05:50.977 --> 05:53.879
You were blinded by love.

05:53.914 --> 05:55.448
What was my excuse?

05:55.482 --> 05:58.117
Probably the same,

05:58.151 --> 06:00.553
just for someone else.

06:00.587 --> 06:02.622
Well, he's right
about one thing...

06:02.656 --> 06:04.023
love is a weapon,

06:04.057 --> 06:06.591
as dangerous and persuasive as magic.

06:08.094 --> 06:10.329
Yeah.

06:10.363 --> 06:13.465
Yeah. He had both of our hearts.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.367
Hey.

06:17.403 --> 06:20.739
As big a bastard as he was,

06:20.773 --> 06:22.641
he did love you.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.711
And, uh,

06:25.745 --> 06:29.815
now he's gone from our lives forever.

06:32.952 --> 06:34.185
Yeah, I...

06:34.220 --> 06:38.022
I just, I uh... I just hope he's found

06:38.057 --> 06:40.558
whatever it is he's looking for.

06:58.076 --> 06:59.309
Ugh.

07:03.114 --> 07:04.915
That means it's ready.

07:04.949 --> 07:08.452
Yes, I know how to work
a microwave, thank you.

07:08.487 --> 07:11.388
Because the dark one did
so much cooking in his time.

07:11.422 --> 07:12.956
Well, worry not.

07:12.991 --> 07:15.259
My power extends far beyond ramen noodles.

07:15.293 --> 07:17.460
Yeah, just not in this life.

07:17.495 --> 07:19.562
You know, I'm beginning to
think you're a lot of talk,

07:19.597 --> 07:22.966
a lot of empty promises
about happy endings,

07:23.001 --> 07:26.636
when all you do is eat my
food, sleep on my couch.

07:26.670 --> 07:29.939
That better not be the last ramen!

07:29.973 --> 07:31.974
Do I look like I'm made of money?

07:32.009 --> 07:33.410
I work at an aquarium.

07:33.444 --> 07:34.944
No, that's not what you do.

07:34.978 --> 07:36.979
What you do is complain.

07:37.014 --> 07:38.948
You know why? I love you, babies.

07:38.982 --> 07:42.118
Because your life, for want
of a better term, is crap.

07:42.152 --> 07:44.320
Hey, are you forgetting
who's been taking care of you?

07:44.354 --> 07:45.955
Please.

07:45.989 --> 07:48.090
Providing reheatable noodles

07:48.125 --> 07:51.593
and what might charitably
be called shelter...

07:51.628 --> 07:52.594
no great gift.

07:52.629 --> 07:56.598
Certainly not compared
to what I'm providing.

07:56.633 --> 07:58.667
I'm gonna fix all your
problems. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:58.701 --> 08:01.102
I know you well enough to
know you don't care about me.

08:01.137 --> 08:03.906
No, I don't. I care about me.

08:03.940 --> 08:07.576
You're lucky our problems
just so happen to align.

08:10.847 --> 08:12.147
Mm-hmm.

08:13.382 --> 08:16.151
You got something?

08:17.453 --> 08:18.619
The beginning.

08:18.654 --> 08:20.488
Of what?

08:20.522 --> 08:23.024
The end of our misery.

08:23.059 --> 08:25.660
It's time to visit an old friend.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.868
So this is where she lives?

08:33.902 --> 08:36.169
I guess some of us are
doing better than others.

08:36.203 --> 08:39.139
Look at this. This is too awful.

08:40.676 --> 08:43.043
Darling, do we need all these theatrics?

08:43.078 --> 08:45.045
Were doing better.

08:47.182 --> 08:48.315
Ma'am...

08:49.750 --> 08:51.318
Sorry, lady.

08:51.353 --> 08:54.221
This was mine before.

08:56.224 --> 08:58.092
Cruella de Vil.

08:59.327 --> 09:01.695
No one calls me that here.

09:01.729 --> 09:02.863
Well, I'm sorry, dearie,

09:02.897 --> 09:06.132
but Cruella Feinberg doesn't
have quite the same ring.

09:06.166 --> 09:09.068
What in hell are you two doing here?

09:09.103 --> 09:11.204
Looking to regain our greater glory.

09:11.238 --> 09:14.007
A glory I can soon return
to you both, if you join me.

09:14.041 --> 09:15.742
I'm not going anywhere with you.

09:15.776 --> 09:17.210
Well, maybe you should.

09:18.245 --> 09:20.213
Things have changed.

09:21.616 --> 09:23.916
Mea Culpa.

09:23.950 --> 09:27.387
Our last time together was less than ideal.

09:27.421 --> 09:32.058
But now? Now our interests align once more.

09:32.092 --> 09:33.826
You've lost all you have,

09:33.860 --> 09:36.396
and so have we.

09:36.430 --> 09:38.197
That's why I'm here,

09:38.232 --> 09:40.432
to put an end to having
everything taken away.

09:40.466 --> 09:42.167
Oh, not everything.

09:55.148 --> 09:56.014
And where are you gonna go

09:56.049 --> 09:58.050
with these paltry material possessions?

09:59.218 --> 10:01.520
To get myself some less paltry possessions.

10:01.554 --> 10:03.688
An empty pursuit.

10:03.722 --> 10:05.623
You're gonna end up right
back where you started.

10:05.658 --> 10:09.127
I will never go back to where I started.

10:09.162 --> 10:12.096
I can get back everything
you've lost and more.

10:12.130 --> 10:14.298
You know, you talk a good game, dark one,

10:14.332 --> 10:16.701
but can you deliver in
a world with no magic

10:16.735 --> 10:19.270
where apparently walking is a challenge?

10:19.304 --> 10:24.241
Ah, but there is magic in this world.

10:24.276 --> 10:27.712
You just have to know where to look.

10:27.746 --> 10:29.713
I know you don't trust me.

10:29.747 --> 10:32.783
But the good news is, if you follow me,

10:32.817 --> 10:36.087
you won't have to.

10:36.121 --> 10:38.922
Aren't you tired of feeling ordinary?

10:42.427 --> 10:44.128
Get in.

10:48.365 --> 10:50.333
Now then, darling, where are we going?

10:50.367 --> 10:54.137
A quaint little town called Storybrooke.

11:01.116 --> 11:04.204
Now then, this happy ending
shenanigan you're promising us,

11:04.365 --> 11:05.514
can you really do that?

11:05.576 --> 11:07.310
Are you really that powerful?

11:07.344 --> 11:09.813
Yeah, he's powerful,
but not that powerful.

11:09.847 --> 11:11.347
No one is.

11:11.382 --> 11:13.550
Love how you underestimate me.

11:13.584 --> 11:14.484
Adorable.

11:14.518 --> 11:16.152
What exactly are you offering, short stuff?

11:16.187 --> 11:18.721
Only the answer to all your prayers.

11:18.755 --> 11:20.456
I'm not exactly the religious sort.

11:20.491 --> 11:21.957
Shocked.

11:21.992 --> 11:23.560
Look.

11:23.969 --> 11:26.938
I was quite content with my life
until I received this summons,

11:26.972 --> 11:28.439
and I do not appreciate

11:28.473 --> 11:31.241
being dragged around on false promises.

11:31.276 --> 11:33.710
Nothing false about it, dearie.

11:33.744 --> 11:36.046
I know exactly what you want,

11:36.081 --> 11:38.082
and you,

11:38.116 --> 11:40.050
and you.

11:40.085 --> 11:41.918
- Really?
- Really.

11:41.953 --> 11:43.520
But don't worry.

11:43.555 --> 11:45.354
I'm not one to betray trusts,

11:45.389 --> 11:48.124
so your secrets can remain your own.

11:48.158 --> 11:51.027
What I will share is what
we all have in common...

11:51.062 --> 11:53.296
a desire for happiness.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.932
A desire to do what villains can never do.

11:55.967 --> 11:58.068
To win.

11:58.102 --> 12:01.904
And I'm here to show you how, together.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.939
Even if we would work together,

12:03.974 --> 12:07.443
no spell known to man or woman
can do what you're saying.

12:07.478 --> 12:09.078
Of course not, dearie.

12:09.113 --> 12:11.647
But we're not looking for a spell.

12:11.681 --> 12:13.116
We're looking for a curse.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.651
A dark curse.

12:15.685 --> 12:18.087
One that, if you help procure it,

12:18.121 --> 12:21.957
can get each and every one of
you exactly what you want...

12:21.992 --> 12:24.126
your...

12:24.160 --> 12:26.495
Happy...

12:26.529 --> 12:28.097
Ending.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.970
So why should I think
this new plan will work

12:36.005 --> 12:38.240
when all the others have failed?

12:38.274 --> 12:40.808
Our failures in the past
have been for one reason...

12:40.843 --> 12:42.444
the odds were stacked against us.

12:42.478 --> 12:44.912
Now we're gonna change the odds.

12:44.947 --> 12:47.815
With this author you
keep babbling on about.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.252
His book harnesses a great power,

12:50.286 --> 12:53.021
one that exceeds anything
you've ever experienced,

12:53.055 --> 12:57.125
giving villains and heroes
what he deems just desserts.

12:57.159 --> 12:58.993
Our collective frustrations?

12:59.028 --> 13:02.163
They're because of his
will, not our missteps.

13:02.197 --> 13:03.597
Well, I suppose that's better

13:03.632 --> 13:05.900
than blaming bad judgment and gin.

13:07.984 --> 13:10.804
Welcome to Mr. Cluck's.
What can I get you?

13:10.838 --> 13:12.339
One double cluck combo.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.141
Make it two. Rumple?

13:14.176 --> 13:15.543
No, thanks.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.378
I'd like to survive for my happy ending.

13:17.412 --> 13:19.380
That'll be $14.15.

13:19.414 --> 13:20.881
Please pull up to the window.

13:20.915 --> 13:22.316
And have a clucky cluck cluck day.

13:22.350 --> 13:24.184
Will you hurry up?

13:24.218 --> 13:27.054
I'm fairly certain this
author's in Storybrooke.

13:27.088 --> 13:28.521
And if we want to enlist his help,

13:28.556 --> 13:30.991
we have to get there before the heroes do.

13:38.666 --> 13:41.000
How do you feel about kale salad?

13:41.034 --> 13:44.370
Like someone found someplace
other than granny's for takeout.

13:44.405 --> 13:45.572
I'm fine with her grilled cheese,

13:45.606 --> 13:46.806
but I know it gets to you.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.175
You eat like a child.

13:49.210 --> 13:50.577
Is that a root beer?

13:50.611 --> 13:53.213
Two. I got you one. Thought
you could use a break.

13:53.247 --> 13:56.148
A break from what? Dead end after dead end?

13:56.183 --> 13:58.217
This sorcerer
Or author...

13:58.251 --> 14:00.019
whatever he wants
to be called...

14:00.053 --> 14:01.887
doesn't want to be found.

14:01.922 --> 14:03.488
It's only been a few weeks. Exactly,

14:03.523 --> 14:06.058
and I've conquered entire
realms in less time.

14:06.093 --> 14:08.260
Can you conquer these bottles?
I thought they were twist-offs.

14:08.294 --> 14:10.395
Do I look like I can pry
them off with my teeth?

14:10.430 --> 14:12.998
I'm a queen and a bit more refined.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.366
Yeah, I got that.

14:15.568 --> 14:17.936
My mom had a bottle opener
here during her brief tenure,

14:17.970 --> 14:20.004
somewhere. Wait! Don't...

14:27.079 --> 14:28.146
What's this?

14:29.782 --> 14:31.916
Did you take it from the book?

14:31.951 --> 14:34.552
It's not from the book.

14:36.122 --> 14:38.289
Robin found it...

14:38.323 --> 14:41.192
Before he left with his family.

14:41.227 --> 14:43.862
It appeared to him.

14:43.896 --> 14:45.764
It's not your story. What is it?

14:48.433 --> 14:52.035
Robin thought it was hope,

14:52.070 --> 14:54.071
a sign that...

14:54.105 --> 14:56.274
Things would work out for me.

14:57.842 --> 15:01.479
Turns out it was a cruel joke.

15:01.513 --> 15:03.914
Have you heard from him?

15:06.450 --> 15:07.951
No.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.155
There may be a way to get the fairies out.

15:11.189 --> 15:13.991
Yeah, I, uh, I found an incantation.

15:14.025 --> 15:16.794
It's, uh, it's part of a
spell in, uh, an ancient tongue

15:16.828 --> 15:18.461
I've never seen before.

15:18.496 --> 15:21.063
Which made translation a
challenge. But I did it.

15:21.098 --> 15:24.133
I found a perfect of
linguistics from Oxford,

15:24.168 --> 15:26.336
and he just e-mailed
me with the translation.

15:26.370 --> 15:28.237
It's an ancient ceremony,

15:28.272 --> 15:31.274
but, uh, one that'll bring them back.

15:31.309 --> 15:35.244
I, uh, I just need you to enact it.

15:35.279 --> 15:36.813
Ceremony, huh?

15:36.847 --> 15:38.480
Well, madame mayor,

15:38.515 --> 15:41.083
ready to pronounce today
"free the fairies day"?

15:45.055 --> 15:46.122
Here.

15:48.158 --> 15:49.158
You got it?

15:49.193 --> 15:51.027
I got it.

16:35.270 --> 16:38.239
Thank you. You all right?

16:38.273 --> 16:41.409
No. I'll live.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.311
But being in there with...

16:44.346 --> 16:45.579
Thank you.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.014
Actually, you should thank the mayor.

16:49.251 --> 16:50.517
Welcome back.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.354
Thank you.

17:21.997 --> 17:25.612
The curse resides
here... bald mountain.

17:26.559 --> 17:31.563
It's protected by a variety
of lethal magic obstacles...

17:31.597 --> 17:36.535
obstacles that suit your
very specific talents.

17:36.569 --> 17:38.570
Blood scarabs.

17:38.604 --> 17:40.405
The only thing stronger than their Venom

17:40.440 --> 17:42.474
is their Bloodlust.

17:42.508 --> 17:47.145
Cruella, I believe with
your powers of persuasion

17:47.179 --> 17:49.981
they'll be as harmless as puppy dogs.

17:57.856 --> 18:01.092
I've got a little job for you, darling.

18:04.863 --> 18:07.465
Now run along and tell the others.

18:20.745 --> 18:23.146
That's how it's done, darlings.

18:31.789 --> 18:33.890
The dark curse.

18:41.765 --> 18:44.534
Fire.

18:47.104 --> 18:48.771
Forged from the breath of dragons.

18:48.806 --> 18:51.407
Maleficent,

18:51.441 --> 18:55.244
I believe this is your area of expertise.

19:26.709 --> 19:28.911
Next time, maybe something challenging.

19:28.945 --> 19:30.913
And now...

19:30.947 --> 19:32.581
Ursula...

19:32.615 --> 19:33.882
If you don't mind.

19:40.122 --> 19:42.323
This what you're looking for?

19:42.358 --> 19:44.526
Indeed.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.127
What the hell?

19:46.162 --> 19:47.628
What is going on?

19:47.663 --> 19:50.298
I'm leaving with my prize. And you?

19:50.332 --> 19:52.499
Uh, you're about to die.

19:53.168 --> 19:58.138
I forgot to mention there's one
more thing guarding the curse.

19:58.173 --> 19:59.607
The Chernabog...

19:59.641 --> 20:03.143
an ancient demon that feeds on evil.

20:03.178 --> 20:04.344
It seeks out the heart

20:04.379 --> 20:07.548
with the greatest potential
for darkness and devours it.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.418
That's why I really needed you three.

20:12.987 --> 20:14.988
Adieu.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.746
Stop the car.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.423
We're here.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.130
What the hell
are you talking about?

20:52.226 --> 20:53.586
Where is this Storybrooke?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.920
Look, I confess, things
aren't quite as I said.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.221
For a man who's preaching trust,

20:57.256 --> 20:58.923
you are getting off on the wrong foot.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.692
But I-if I was completely untrustworthy,

21:00.726 --> 21:02.593
would I be telling you the truth now?

21:02.628 --> 21:04.729
The...
the town line is, uh...

21:04.764 --> 21:06.297
100 yards up that road.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.299
- Oh.
- But...

21:08.333 --> 21:10.401
It's cloaked by a protection spell.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.771
Makes it impossible to see or enter.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.738
A town you can't see or enter?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.474
But it's the truth.

21:16.508 --> 21:17.642
The night I was banished,

21:17.676 --> 21:19.910
I-I attached this tie to that tree

21:19.944 --> 21:21.945
so I'd be able to find my way home.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.714
Okay, let's say you are telling the truth.

21:23.748 --> 21:25.883
How are we supposed to cross
that line without any magic?

21:28.153 --> 21:30.320
No more encores, Rumple.

21:30.354 --> 21:32.723
We're finished with your hazy instructions

21:32.757 --> 21:34.658
and your empty promises.

21:34.692 --> 21:37.760
Please put the gun
down. You're overreact...

21:39.530 --> 21:40.697
No more tricks.

21:40.731 --> 21:44.067
If we're about to walk into
a trap, tell us now, darling,

21:44.101 --> 21:47.737
because out here, you're
nothing more than a cripple,

21:47.771 --> 21:51.607
a coward with a real world ability to die.

21:51.641 --> 21:53.843
Yes, yes. Y-y-you're
right. You're right.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.912
So you say you're banished.

21:55.946 --> 21:57.580
Who banished you and why?

21:57.614 --> 21:59.481
I bet it was his little maid. Mm.

21:59.516 --> 22:02.418
Is that why we're here? Because of a girl?

22:03.787 --> 22:06.589
I'm here for the same reason you are.

22:07.691 --> 22:09.791
My happy ending.

22:09.826 --> 22:11.694
And that is the truth.

22:11.728 --> 22:13.662
And what that is? Well...

22:13.697 --> 22:15.864
That's my business,

22:15.898 --> 22:19.034
just like your reasons are yours.

22:19.068 --> 22:22.671
All of that we seek is
just beyond that line.

22:22.706 --> 22:26.674
So please, if you think you
can find your way in this town,

22:26.709 --> 22:30.645
and... and face all that...
that light magic without my help,

22:30.679 --> 22:32.114
then be my guest.

22:32.148 --> 22:35.350
But if you can just trust me...

22:35.384 --> 22:37.185
You won't just get inside Storybrooke,

22:37.220 --> 22:39.520
- you'll be invited. 
- Uh-huh.

22:39.555 --> 22:40.655
Like the people of Storybrooke

22:40.689 --> 22:43.824
are gonna invite us in
with you by our side.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.331
Yes, they will, dearie,

22:50.366 --> 22:52.800
cause I won't be on your side.

22:56.437 --> 23:00.040
All right. Start talking.

23:04.345 --> 23:06.713
Whoa. Beware of lurking pirates.

23:06.748 --> 23:07.915
What are you doing?

23:07.949 --> 23:09.116
Just thinking.

23:09.151 --> 23:11.752
Lurking and brooding.
That's a classic combo.

23:11.787 --> 23:14.655
I think heroes can do a little
bit of bragging and celebrating.

23:14.689 --> 23:17.190
Let's go. It's a party. We should...

23:17.224 --> 23:20.594
Buckle some swash or, you know, whatever.

23:20.628 --> 23:21.795
I'm hardly a hero.

23:21.829 --> 23:24.331
The fairies were only in the
hat because I put them there.

23:24.365 --> 23:27.401
You weren't in control
of that. That was gold.

23:27.435 --> 23:30.736
Trust me. You have a
mark in the hero column.

23:30.771 --> 23:32.839
I hope so.

23:32.873 --> 23:35.541
Come on.

23:50.123 --> 23:52.358
Go on, mom. Ask.

23:54.861 --> 23:56.295
Excuse me.

23:58.198 --> 23:59.898
May I ask you something?

24:01.468 --> 24:02.901
What can I do for you?

24:05.872 --> 24:08.740
Do you know what this is?

24:10.810 --> 24:12.110
Where did you get this?

24:12.145 --> 24:13.145
The sorcerer's mansion.

24:13.179 --> 24:15.948
Henry found dozens of
these blank books there.

24:15.982 --> 24:17.015
The sorcerer is here?

24:17.050 --> 24:19.718
Well, his house is, but
we haven't found him yet.

24:19.752 --> 24:21.018
You're looking for him?

24:21.053 --> 24:24.789
Well, I was hoping he could...

24:24.824 --> 24:26.758
Write me a happy ending.

24:28.394 --> 24:31.429
But that book seems to have great power.

24:31.464 --> 24:33.264
Oh, it does.

24:33.298 --> 24:35.733
So I thought if he
rewrote it...

24:38.237 --> 24:40.104
I know it sounds crazy.

24:40.138 --> 24:43.207
It's not crazy at all.

24:43.242 --> 24:46.210
But you're looking for the wrong person.

24:46.245 --> 24:49.646
Although the sorcerer is
a very powerful wizard,

24:49.681 --> 24:50.948
you should be looking for the author.

24:50.983 --> 24:52.949
Aren't they the same person?

24:52.984 --> 24:55.085
Why would the sorcerer
have the author's books?

24:55.119 --> 24:57.654
That is a quite perplexing question.

24:57.689 --> 24:59.890
And I'm afraid I do not know.

24:59.924 --> 25:03.059
But I do know that they are
two very different people.

25:05.697 --> 25:08.899
So... You know who the author is.

25:08.933 --> 25:10.800
No.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.835
But I do know he exists.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.438
I mean, if he is a "he."

25:15.472 --> 25:16.940
I've never actually seen him.

25:16.974 --> 25:20.076
In fact, no one has. Not for many years.

25:21.812 --> 25:24.014
So this is where hope has gotten me?

25:24.048 --> 25:28.250
We'll find him, Regina. It's
not like he just vanished.

25:28.285 --> 25:30.953
Blue, do you have any idea
why he might've disappeared?

25:30.987 --> 25:32.354
Sadly, no.

25:32.389 --> 25:34.824
But there are whispers
that he left hidden clues

25:34.858 --> 25:36.158
in some of his works.

25:36.192 --> 25:38.428
You mean, works like Henry's book?

25:48.838 --> 25:50.372
What the hell was that?

25:50.407 --> 25:52.441
I suppose we should go out and see

25:52.475 --> 25:55.777
what's killing property values this time.

25:55.812 --> 25:56.845
Come on! Hurry!

26:40.613 --> 26:43.881
There's a crack in the wall.
We can make it through it.

26:43.915 --> 26:45.716
Well, that's easier said than done.

26:45.751 --> 26:48.919
It doesn't seem to know which
one of us to go after first.

26:48.954 --> 26:50.454
Doesn't matter. Once it makes its choice,

26:50.488 --> 26:52.522
the other two can make their way to safety.

26:52.557 --> 26:54.892
So what, we're just playing
a game of heart roulette?

26:54.926 --> 26:57.128
Once the other two are out of harm's way,

26:57.162 --> 26:59.396
they can work together to
save the one left behind.

26:59.430 --> 27:01.431
Must I figure out everything?

27:01.466 --> 27:03.133
And we're supposed to just...
Trust you?

27:03.167 --> 27:04.868
First time for everything.

27:29.927 --> 27:32.295
I knew it.

27:56.119 --> 27:57.986
Did that thing come out of the hat?!

27:58.021 --> 28:00.155
I thought the spell was only
supposed to release the fairies.

28:00.190 --> 28:01.824
Well, maybe it is some kind of fairy.

28:01.858 --> 28:02.858
Why don't we just put it back in the hat

28:02.892 --> 28:04.235
- and figure out the rest later?
- Because we can't.

28:04.235 --> 28:06.961
Once something's freed,
it can never be retrapped.

28:06.995 --> 28:09.331
Great. So our best defense
against magical beasts

28:09.365 --> 28:11.366
follows the same rules as chicken pox?

28:11.400 --> 28:14.168
Surely the savoir and evil queen
can defeat a simple hell beast.

28:14.203 --> 28:16.805
Can we drop the "e" word already?

28:41.696 --> 28:43.063
Well, that was easy.

28:43.097 --> 28:45.531
Don't get excited. We only stunned it.

28:45.566 --> 28:48.168
And a blast like that
should've destroyed it.

28:48.202 --> 28:49.469
I was just getting used

28:49.503 --> 28:50.803
to things being relaxing around here.

28:50.838 --> 28:52.172
Belle... I'll see if I can

28:52.206 --> 28:54.341
find anything about this
thing in the library.

28:54.375 --> 28:56.977
Thanks. And, Mary Margaret... I'll
get everyone to safety. I'm on that.

28:57.011 --> 28:59.179
Wow. You guys really have this down.

28:59.213 --> 29:01.046
Well, this isn't our first monster bash.

29:02.015 --> 29:03.883
Well, now that that's settled,

29:03.917 --> 29:06.586
what say you and I figure out
a way to clip this bat's wings

29:06.620 --> 29:09.856
before it comes back?

29:09.890 --> 29:11.991
The number's all cued up.

29:12.025 --> 29:14.159
All you have to do is
press the "call" button.

29:14.194 --> 29:16.228
I know a phone works.

29:16.263 --> 29:18.097
I just don't know if I can
trust the man whose phone it is.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.731
And why is that?

29:19.766 --> 29:22.167
I mean, you have my phone, my entire plan.

29:22.202 --> 29:25.570
And tonight, if you decide
not to come back for me

29:25.605 --> 29:27.373
and stay in Storybrooke and abandon me,

29:27.407 --> 29:29.875
I couldn't blame you.

29:29.910 --> 29:32.011
That's why this time is different,

29:32.045 --> 29:33.144
because this time,

29:33.178 --> 29:36.381
my entire salvation depends
not on you trusting me,

29:36.416 --> 29:38.550
but on me trusting you.

29:40.319 --> 29:43.722
Now... Are we in this together?

29:47.727 --> 29:50.128
I guess you'll find out tonight, won't you?

29:59.504 --> 30:03.274
Regina, who is it?

30:03.309 --> 30:05.209
The sea bitch.

30:05.244 --> 30:08.145
I've missed you, too. How are you?

30:08.179 --> 30:11.816
Mostly wondering how a
plate of undercooked calamari

30:11.850 --> 30:14.051
ended up with the dark one's cell phone.

30:14.085 --> 30:15.185
I stole it from him.

30:16.521 --> 30:18.322
Regina.

30:20.325 --> 30:22.993
- And where is he now?
- If we're lucky,

30:23.027 --> 30:24.261
probably passed out at the dive bar

30:24.295 --> 30:25.728
where Cruella and I left him.

30:25.763 --> 30:27.264
Cruella?

30:27.298 --> 30:28.498
Yes, we're back together.

30:28.532 --> 30:32.169
Rumple found us in New York,
said he needed some old friends.

30:32.203 --> 30:33.903
Told us a tearful tale about how
he was living in a quaint town

30:33.938 --> 30:36.340
until he ruined everything.

30:36.374 --> 30:38.175
But he said it was a special place

30:38.209 --> 30:40.309
where villains could find redemption.

30:40.344 --> 30:42.745
Regina, Rumplestiltskin told us

30:42.780 --> 30:44.581
how you've changed, and we've changed, too.

30:44.615 --> 30:46.616
We've learned our lessons,

30:46.650 --> 30:49.318
and we'd like a chance to prove it to you.

30:49.353 --> 30:52.221
Please. Let us in.

30:57.060 --> 30:59.028
Sorry, dear, but...

30:59.062 --> 31:01.197
We have enough problems
without inviting two...

31:04.334 --> 31:06.802
Is one of those problems a hell-bat

31:06.836 --> 31:09.872
with beady eyes and devil horns?

31:09.906 --> 31:11.540
How did you know that?

31:11.574 --> 31:13.174
Because that's the exact same sound

31:13.209 --> 31:15.377
it made before it tried to kill me.

31:15.411 --> 31:16.678
Oh.

31:16.713 --> 31:18.981
So you've faced this creature before?

31:19.015 --> 31:22.317
Yes, and I can tell you
exactly what it wants.

31:22.351 --> 31:23.485
How convenient.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.787
They've been
living in a land without magic.

31:25.822 --> 31:28.223
How could they do it?

31:28.257 --> 31:29.824
It's the hat.

31:29.858 --> 31:32.093
I know.

31:34.163 --> 31:35.330
Fine.

31:35.364 --> 31:36.731
Tell us what it wants.

31:36.765 --> 31:37.698
And then you'll let us in?

31:37.733 --> 31:40.001
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

31:40.036 --> 31:42.137
Well, then I guess you're on your own.

31:42.171 --> 31:44.205
Wait.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.206
The Snow Queen's scroll let
her into Storybrooke once.

31:46.241 --> 31:48.142
Maybe it'll work for them.

31:50.445 --> 31:52.547
All right, squid.

31:53.916 --> 31:57.451
If your information pans out,
we'll consider letting you in.

31:59.287 --> 32:00.454
Those are my terms.

32:03.958 --> 32:06.326
You've got a deal.

32:14.192 --> 32:15.316
You want darkness?

32:15.717 --> 32:19.189
I'll give you darkness.

32:29.692 --> 32:32.193
We had a deal, witches!

32:37.766 --> 32:39.333
Uhh!

32:39.368 --> 32:40.702
Aah!

32:48.776 --> 32:52.679
I hope you choke on my bones.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.593
Yeah, lovely.

33:06.628 --> 33:09.496
Now I'll never the smell
of fish out of this dress.

33:09.531 --> 33:11.197
You're welcome.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.541
Regina, I'm not sure it's after you.

33:21.575 --> 33:24.511
Of course it's after me.

33:24.545 --> 33:27.747
Ursula said it devours the
heart with the darkest potential.

33:27.781 --> 33:30.750
And now that gold's gone,
well, who else could that be?

33:30.784 --> 33:32.718
I mean, is there a dwarf named evil-y?

33:32.753 --> 33:34.287
It's me.

33:34.321 --> 33:36.221
We're not gonna just sacrifice you.

33:36.256 --> 33:39.191
I'm not sure we have much of a choice.

33:40.994 --> 33:42.762
That thing's magical, right?

33:42.796 --> 33:44.730
I would say "magical"
is a pretty good guess.

33:44.765 --> 33:46.933
So if it's magic, what
happens if it leaves town

33:46.967 --> 33:48.968
for a world with no magic?

33:49.002 --> 33:50.724
No magic, no beast.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.859
So all we have to do is
lead it over the town line.

33:52.893 --> 33:55.395
The Chernabog withstood
both of our powers combined.

33:55.773 --> 33:58.241
Even if I poof myself to the town line,

33:58.275 --> 34:01.444
the second I'm out in the
open, it'll crush me like a bug.

34:01.478 --> 34:03.747
Not if you've got some help. Trust me.

34:06.751 --> 34:08.384
What?

34:09.518 --> 34:11.920
Okay. Be careful.

34:13.257 --> 34:14.822
They found a way to stop the beast.

34:14.858 --> 34:16.592
Great. Why aren't you smiling?

34:16.627 --> 34:19.962
Because Cruella and Ursula...
Are here.

34:32.507 --> 34:34.309
What made you choose yellow?

34:34.342 --> 34:35.110
What?

34:35.145 --> 34:37.980
Your bug... yellow? Bold choice.

34:38.014 --> 34:39.313
I like yellow. I stole it.

34:39.348 --> 34:41.483
Is this really the time
to question my taste?

34:41.516 --> 34:42.984
Sorry, I'm just trying not to think about

34:43.018 --> 34:44.819
being some demon's lunch.

34:44.853 --> 34:46.087
You're not going to be.

34:46.121 --> 34:48.156
I'm glad you're confident.

34:51.694 --> 34:54.496
What, is this thing made of tin?

34:54.530 --> 34:55.697
Hang on. We're almost there.

35:03.004 --> 35:04.237
It's too late.

35:04.272 --> 35:08.141
I'm not gonna let both of us die
in this metal coffin on wheels.

35:12.146 --> 35:15.448
- Thanks for trying, Miss Swan.
- What?!

35:17.584 --> 35:19.186
Regina!

35:28.061 --> 35:29.629
Hey!

36:11.332 --> 36:12.490
Emma!

36:13.572 --> 36:15.506
- Are you all right?
- Emma.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.275
Yes.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.844
So Cruella and Ursula
were telling the truth.

36:19.879 --> 36:22.513
It would appear so.

36:22.547 --> 36:23.848
No, wait. Emma, I...

36:24.884 --> 36:27.050
I think this is a bad idea.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.853
Look, they may have
told the truth this time.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.255
That doesn't mean they can be trusted.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.556
Mom, this doesn't sound like you.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.224
You always believe the best in everyone.

36:34.259 --> 36:36.226
I'm also a realist. Emma, she's right.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.539
Things were just starting to get
back to normal in Storybrooke.

36:38.694 --> 36:40.144
- You, too?
- Look, we don't know

36:40.144 --> 36:41.899
anything about these two.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.800
They could be looking for redemption,

36:43.834 --> 36:47.537
but they also could be as evil
as Mr. Gold or Zelena or worse.

36:47.571 --> 36:49.706
That could be, but they just helped us,

36:49.740 --> 36:51.108
and we made a deal.

36:51.142 --> 36:53.710
Doesn't matter. It's a
bad idea. They're villains.

36:53.744 --> 36:56.579
You're right. They are. They're horrible...

36:56.614 --> 37:00.249
But not as horrible as I was once.

37:00.284 --> 37:04.487
And if I deserve a
second chance, so do they.

37:04.522 --> 37:06.823
How can I sit here,
looking for my happiness,

37:06.857 --> 37:09.826
and deny two others a chance at theirs?

37:09.860 --> 37:12.529
I'm with Regina. We let them in.

37:50.799 --> 37:53.201
Welcome to Storybrooke.

37:53.235 --> 37:54.936
Thank you, Regina.

37:54.971 --> 37:56.171
You won't regret it.

37:56.205 --> 37:58.473
I better not.

37:58.507 --> 38:00.675
Hmm.

38:51.230 --> 38:52.632
We're back, darling.

38:53.044 --> 38:56.111
You didn't think we abandoned
you, did you, dark one?

38:56.146 --> 38:59.175
Of course not.

38:59.175 --> 39:00.942
We're a team.

39:05.181 --> 39:07.182
Nice duds. Now what do we do?

39:07.216 --> 39:09.817
Now we begin our task.

39:12.387 --> 39:13.220
It's simple, really.

39:13.254 --> 39:15.289
Continue to repent your wicked ways.

39:15.323 --> 39:18.292
Make friends. Build relationships.

39:18.326 --> 39:19.794
And just what will you be doing?

39:19.828 --> 39:22.196
I'll continue my work
behind the scenes, of course.

39:22.230 --> 39:24.431
Sounds like we're doing everything, again.

39:25.868 --> 39:29.336
How do you think we got in here?

39:29.371 --> 39:32.606
And how do you think that
Chernabog was released?

39:32.640 --> 39:35.309
It was me.

39:35.343 --> 39:39.380
I'm the Oxford professor who
translated the spell for Belle,

39:39.414 --> 39:41.382
the spell that released the fairies

39:41.416 --> 39:44.350
and also happened to
unleash that monstrosity.

39:44.385 --> 39:47.621
So I ask you consider what I was able to do

39:47.655 --> 39:49.288
on the outside,

39:49.323 --> 39:52.025
at my lowest point, without magic.

39:52.059 --> 39:55.896
And then consider what
I'm able to do in here.

39:55.930 --> 39:58.632
So maybe we should stop
bickering and get on with it.

39:58.666 --> 40:01.200
So our team is one member short.

40:01.235 --> 40:03.202
It's time to reunite the band.

40:03.237 --> 40:05.638
Y-you don't mean...

40:05.672 --> 40:07.006
Maleficent.

40:07.041 --> 40:08.374
But she's dead.

40:08.409 --> 40:10.176
Not entirely.

40:10.210 --> 40:12.078
Well, just what does that mean?

40:12.112 --> 40:14.047
It means we have our work cut out,

40:14.081 --> 40:16.015
much to prepare. I don't like it.

40:16.049 --> 40:19.317
Dead or alive, we got a
bigger problem... Regina.

40:19.352 --> 40:20.853
And what makes you say that?

40:20.887 --> 40:22.821
That beast was unable to defeat her.

40:22.856 --> 40:24.523
As bad as maleficent is,

40:24.558 --> 40:27.225
Regina's dark heart is far worse.

40:27.260 --> 40:31.329
You are so filled with assumptions.

40:31.364 --> 40:34.266
Regina is not the one
we have to worry about.

40:34.300 --> 40:35.733
What?

40:35.768 --> 40:36.935
That beast did seek out

40:36.969 --> 40:39.504
the heart with the greatest
potential for darkness, yes,

40:39.539 --> 40:42.774
but it was wasn't going after Regina.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.709
It was after Emma Swan.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.380
What do you suppose the boy is up to now?

40:48.414 --> 40:50.748
Being Henry.

40:50.783 --> 40:53.017
Mm. If anyone's gonna get
that author out of the book,

40:53.052 --> 40:54.719
it's him. Hmm.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.287
You've become quite the optimist, Swan.

40:56.321 --> 40:57.722
Have I?

40:57.756 --> 40:59.857
Guess I... couldn't really help it,

40:59.892 --> 41:00.925
between him and my parents.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.695
That reminds me. Aren't
they supposed to be here?

41:03.729 --> 41:07.465
You're right. I wonder
what's keeping them.

41:34.792 --> 41:38.161
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

41:38.195 --> 41:40.730
It's been a long time.

41:40.764 --> 41:42.332
We gotta talk.

41:42.366 --> 41:44.567
Oh, so the prince wants a chat?

41:44.602 --> 41:48.404
Okay, handsome. Talk.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.140
This is our town.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.807
If you've really turned over a new leaf,

41:51.842 --> 41:53.343
you're welcome to stay.

41:53.377 --> 41:55.244
My, aren't we generous?

41:55.278 --> 41:56.746
On one condition.

41:58.214 --> 42:01.082
No one must ever know
what happened between us

42:01.117 --> 42:03.451
in the enchanted forest.

42:04.820 --> 42:07.922
And if you say one single word to anyone,

42:07.957 --> 42:10.458
especially Emma,

42:10.492 --> 42:13.327
well, you won't have to
worry about the evil queen.

42:13.362 --> 42:16.898
I'll rip out your hearts myself.
