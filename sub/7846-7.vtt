00:12.691 --> 00:15.250
Are we going to the store,
or...

00:15.315 --> 00:18.807
Quiet. I'm in the middle of 
a Vision Beast battle of wills.

00:18.909 --> 00:20.673
So, it's a staring contest?

00:20.731 --> 00:23.294
It's not just a staring contest!

00:23.352 --> 00:24.391
It's a...

00:24.477 --> 00:26.274
Nice try, McDuck,

00:26.345 --> 00:28.016
but your family bickering

00:28.114 --> 00:30.565
will never get me to look away,
never!

00:30.641 --> 00:32.174
It's a staring contest.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.208
Excuse me, this area

00:34.266 --> 00:35.649
of the Duckburg Billionaires' Club

00:35.707 --> 00:37.821
is only for our
elite members,

00:38.079 --> 00:39.860
the crème de la crème,

00:39.962 --> 00:42.610
the finest ducks in
Duckburg!

00:42.720 --> 00:44.665
Oh! Is that...?

00:45.239 --> 00:46.530
Yup.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.716
Old guys, nice clubhouse
you've got here.

00:50.774 --> 00:54.056
Got a real "I'm so rich I don't
care how I look" quality about it.

00:54.118 --> 00:56.397
Rich peeps! I'm tagging us.

00:56.483 --> 00:58.374
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:58.432 --> 01:00.522
Seriously? Mark Beaks?

01:00.624 --> 01:03.229
Founder and CEO of Waddle?

01:03.319 --> 01:07.366
Soon-to-be newest addition to the of
the Duckburg Billionaires' Club, come on!

01:09.163 --> 01:10.686
- Meh!
- And creator

01:10.788 --> 01:13.827
of the newest tech
innovation, Project Tahdah!

01:13.951 --> 01:16.694
It's everything you think it
is and nothing you're expecting.

01:16.752 --> 01:19.007
I'll flip you my Peep deets
so you can follow my updates.

01:19.065 --> 01:21.010
I don't understand
half those words.

01:21.068 --> 01:22.628
Whoa, weird.

01:22.686 --> 01:24.760
I wouldn't have thought
you successful guys

01:24.827 --> 01:26.878
would be so behind the times.

01:26.936 --> 01:30.178
Allow me to take you
to the future.

01:32.006 --> 01:33.464
Remix!

01:33.522 --> 01:35.038
Pew! Pew pew pew pew!

01:35.100 --> 01:36.671
Pew a-roo!

01:36.819 --> 01:38.186
Wait for it. Wait for it.

01:38.244 --> 01:40.499
Wait for it.
Wait for it!

01:42.124 --> 01:45.350
Ohhhhhhh!

01:46.555 --> 01:48.488
That was Mark Beaks!

01:48.546 --> 01:49.637
He's right in there!

01:49.704 --> 01:52.678
Oh, man, I'm almost
breathing the same air as him.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.363
Oh, ingenuity.

01:54.421 --> 01:55.912
Come on,
like I couldn't be

01:55.970 --> 01:58.217
a young, influential business guy?

01:59.989 --> 02:00.997
What?

02:01.064 --> 02:02.608
Oh. Oh!

02:02.678 --> 02:03.683
You were serious?

02:03.741 --> 02:04.948
It's just you're more

02:05.006 --> 02:06.654
the crazy, irresponsible,
fun guy

02:06.764 --> 02:09.241
than the serious,
brilliant, successful guy.

02:09.299 --> 02:10.377
You don't know!

02:10.436 --> 02:11.573
At least I'm not the guy

02:11.631 --> 02:13.944
who just reads about
people who do stuff guy.

02:14.002 --> 02:17.428
I could be a bigger deal than
Beaks in three years, tops!

02:20.068 --> 02:22.490
I'll pay for that in three
years. I am very sorry.

03:22.552 --> 03:23.998
Keep making dat money, y'all!

03:24.059 --> 03:26.442
See you in $2 million and counting!

03:26.725 --> 03:28.639
Stuck up old money-duddies.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.675
Don't even have
a social media presence.

03:30.733 --> 03:33.003
Mr. Beaks, I'm Dewey,
future astronaut president...

03:33.061 --> 03:35.584
Can you sign this? You're
my hero and a genius!

03:35.787 --> 03:39.045
Genius? You two,
I like how much you like me!

03:39.116 --> 03:40.768
That shows real smarts!

03:40.835 --> 03:43.040
Come by the offices and
I'll hook you up with a tour.

03:43.107 --> 03:45.794
Maybe even an after-school job?

03:45.861 --> 03:48.311
Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew!

03:48.429 --> 03:50.967
Pew! Pew pew-pew!

03:51.025 --> 03:52.893
- You mean it?!
- Sure. Why not.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.426
Amazing sauce. I'll text you.

03:54.493 --> 03:56.452
Internship starts maana!

03:58.170 --> 03:59.622
Ach...

03:59.792 --> 04:01.214
What, did you say something?

04:01.272 --> 04:02.717
I was just grumbling.

04:02.803 --> 04:03.929
Well, do it louder.

04:03.996 --> 04:05.787
Then it's not grumbling!

04:05.857 --> 04:07.584
Gah, I hate this music.

04:07.644 --> 04:09.633
We've got to do
something about New Guy.

04:09.691 --> 04:11.369
I never had Lou's Pie.

04:11.436 --> 04:13.795
No, New Guy!

04:13.881 --> 04:16.647
Oh, agreed!
Let's get rid of him!

04:16.764 --> 04:18.709
Great. Now I want pie!

04:20.637 --> 04:21.853
Wait, no!

04:21.911 --> 04:24.521
Hah!
See you tomorrow, Flinty.

04:26.373 --> 04:27.494
Let's see.

04:27.561 --> 04:29.141
Can Do Attitude, check.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.607
Professional posture...
check.

04:31.756 --> 04:33.694
Completed checklist,
check.

04:33.849 --> 04:35.706
Wow, I can't believe
we get to be interns

04:35.764 --> 04:37.346
at Waddle for Mark Beaks!

04:37.404 --> 04:40.404
Yeah, I'm mostly doing it
to show off this bad boy.

04:40.490 --> 04:41.843
- What is that?
- Oh, this?

04:41.910 --> 04:44.295
It's my super serious
business briefcase.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.822
"What brilliant business
secrets

04:45.880 --> 04:47.307
is he hiding in there?"

04:47.365 --> 04:48.932
Who knows?!

04:49.107 --> 04:50.541
You can't open the lock,
can you?

04:50.724 --> 04:51.825
Nope.

04:53.857 --> 04:56.432
Welcome to Waddle,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.885
where imagination and
innovation

04:58.943 --> 05:01.240
get married and have babies!

05:02.193 --> 05:03.479
Digital high-five app,

05:03.546 --> 05:05.090
so you never get left
hanging,

05:05.157 --> 05:06.786
or, you know, have to
touch anyone.

05:06.865 --> 05:09.044
Come, roll with Beaks.

05:09.171 --> 05:11.278
Here are the high-impact
trampolines,

05:11.378 --> 05:12.849
the low-impact trampolines,

05:12.907 --> 05:15.705
and, of course, the
no-impact trampolines.

05:15.763 --> 05:17.134
Those are fun.

05:17.872 --> 05:20.036
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

05:20.993 --> 05:22.380
Slides are the new stairs.

05:22.438 --> 05:24.411
Ha! That's actually
pretty cool!

05:24.490 --> 05:26.796
If, by cool, you mean
statistically proven

05:26.863 --> 05:28.283
to increase employee productivity.

05:28.341 --> 05:29.517
Huh! This guy.

05:29.575 --> 05:30.907
Oh, before you ask,

05:30.974 --> 05:32.675
yeah, it's all made of candy.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.990
You're welcome.

05:35.255 --> 05:37.172
Ooh, wow!

05:37.239 --> 05:39.154
Who knew work could be
so awesome?

05:39.270 --> 05:41.083
Mark Beaks did. Blamo!

05:41.676 --> 05:43.995
He talks the way I want to live!

05:44.091 --> 05:46.547
Here are your official
Waddle trainee beanies.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.216
Congratulations, weenies!

05:48.283 --> 05:50.044
Oh, P.S., there's only
space for one intern,

05:50.117 --> 05:52.167
so one of you is going
home by the end of the day.

05:52.255 --> 05:54.193
Cool? Cool. Beaks out!

05:54.802 --> 05:56.317
One internship?!

05:56.404 --> 05:58.642
Well, hehe, you didn't
really want it anyway,

05:58.700 --> 06:00.736
so I'll just tell Mr.
Beaks to give it to me.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.271
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.755
Sliding my way to billions?

06:03.857 --> 06:05.383
Licking other people's stuff?

06:05.450 --> 06:08.502
It's everything I never
knew I always wanted!

06:08.560 --> 06:10.075
I am in!

06:10.138 --> 06:12.247
This is about more than
just goofing around.

06:12.314 --> 06:14.021
Whee!

06:14.091 --> 06:15.205
You're doing it wrong.

06:15.263 --> 06:17.115
This is supposed to
be efficient, not fun.

06:17.185 --> 06:18.216
Whee.

06:18.482 --> 06:20.654
Ha! I'm about to be a billionaire!

06:20.728 --> 06:22.091
And when Scrooge tries

06:22.149 --> 06:23.617
to follow me online,
I'll block him.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.857
Man, you are killing it today,
Beaks!

06:26.827 --> 06:28.630
Sir, you can't go in there!

06:30.375 --> 06:31.408
Stop right there!

06:31.466 --> 06:33.286
Ooh, neat!

06:37.301 --> 06:40.674
Mr. Beaks,
allow me to introduce myself.

06:40.741 --> 06:44.175
Falcon Graves,
Professional Corporate Saboteur and...

06:44.242 --> 06:47.580
Professional is right, man!
That suit game is on point.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.927
As I was saying,
unfortunately for you,

06:50.997 --> 06:54.708
I've been hired to steal
your coveted Project Tahdah.

06:54.772 --> 06:56.158
What are you doing?

06:56.217 --> 06:58.342
I'm just updating my
status to "hostage."

06:58.400 --> 07:00.994
Feel like this could be
huge for my online presence.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.060
Oh, uh, were you not
done with your speech?

07:04.312 --> 07:05.802
Get me to
Research & Development.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.294
Hey, let him go. Aah!

07:07.644 --> 07:09.354
Immediately.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.120
Turn that nonsense off!

07:15.187 --> 07:18.145
I already tried.
It's impossible.

07:19.441 --> 07:21.517
Well, how was I supposed
to know the "On" button

07:21.584 --> 07:23.505
and the "Off" button
were the same button?

07:23.563 --> 07:25.341
Did you sleep here last night?

07:26.435 --> 07:27.761
Don't be ridiculous.

07:27.828 --> 07:30.567
Who can sleep when you're
plotting against a nemesis?

07:30.708 --> 07:32.716
That cocky Mark Beaks
may be

07:32.774 --> 07:34.752
the only man
I hate as much as you!

07:34.810 --> 07:36.029
I know the feeling.

07:36.096 --> 07:38.935
So now I propose we get rid of him.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.716
♪♪

07:43.937 --> 07:45.895
Do we really need
a slideshow?

07:46.028 --> 07:48.403
Ha! Sweet,
naive Scroogy.

07:48.494 --> 07:51.255
Leave the devious planning
to the professionals.

07:51.380 --> 07:54.122
You're in my world now,
McDuck.

07:54.356 --> 07:56.893
Yeah, all right. Show
me what you've got.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.372
No, you're actually
on my side of the room.

08:04.079 --> 08:06.817
Ooh, task lists!
This is a place of dreams!

08:06.888 --> 08:08.700
Oh, I don't know, Dewey,
this looks like

08:08.758 --> 08:10.595
a whole bunch of boring
business-guy tasks.

08:10.653 --> 08:12.154
You're not really equipped
to handle them, so...

08:12.211 --> 08:14.800
And lose this internship to you?
No way!

08:14.858 --> 08:17.556
This place has free snow cones!

08:17.614 --> 08:20.716
Free snow cones!

08:25.145 --> 08:26.981
Thank you for calling
Waddle. Please hold.

08:27.052 --> 08:28.842
Thank you for calling Waddle.
Please hold. Please hold.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.033
- Waddle.
- Yup, yeah, no. I totally get it.

08:31.091 --> 08:32.611
I hate talking on the phone, too,

08:32.669 --> 08:34.823
so that's why I kick my
feet up, I'm leaning back...

08:34.890 --> 08:36.009
Who are you talking to?

08:36.076 --> 08:41.416
Oh, uh...
Business-man-Ning-ton-son?

08:42.259 --> 08:43.946
Oh, you just missed him!

08:55.775 --> 08:58.302
Okay. One sandwich cut
diagonally with no crusts,

08:58.360 --> 08:59.928
no pickles, but yes
to pickles on the side,

08:59.985 --> 09:01.089
so you can decide
which pickles

09:01.146 --> 09:02.146
- to use.
- I got pizza!

09:02.204 --> 09:04.252
Everybody loves pizza!

09:04.319 --> 09:06.123
New guy! New guy!

09:06.227 --> 09:08.060
But I'm also the new guy...

09:09.349 --> 09:10.950
There's the high-impact
trampolines,

09:11.009 --> 09:12.642
the low-impact trampolines...

09:12.709 --> 09:16.400
Mr. Beaks,
is the tour really necessary?

09:16.458 --> 09:18.237
Listen, Graves,
if we're gonna keep

09:18.304 --> 09:21.236
this hostage stuff on the DL,
I gotta act natural.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.346
And naturally,

09:22.404 --> 09:24.513
I give tours of my
awesome company!

09:24.623 --> 09:26.029
Must I wear the hat?

09:26.091 --> 09:28.757
You bet. All trainees
gotta wear the hat,

09:28.824 --> 09:31.062
and you are a trainee,
right?

09:31.129 --> 09:32.154
Boop!

09:33.411 --> 09:34.638
Complimentary snow cone?

09:34.817 --> 09:36.317
Oops, you dropped it.
Here's another.

09:36.505 --> 09:37.544
How 'bout blueberry?

09:37.602 --> 09:39.620
Ah, good call, that one
stains your mouth forever.

09:39.685 --> 09:41.425
- Look, see? Ahh...
- You do realize

09:41.485 --> 09:44.162
you're in quite
a lot of danger right now.

09:45.123 --> 09:48.638
I know! I'm gonna be
trending online for days!

09:48.730 --> 09:49.990
Hostage selfie!

09:53.738 --> 09:54.998
Backup phones.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.271
Excuse me, Mr. Beaks.

10:00.329 --> 10:02.189
I just tagged us together.
'Sup?

10:02.247 --> 10:04.893
Mr. Beaks, here's my
completed, color-coded,

10:04.951 --> 10:06.716
and categorized checklist.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.356
I even made
some categories for...

10:08.500 --> 10:10.054
I ordered everybody pizza.

10:10.138 --> 10:13.701
So who would you say is in
the lead for the internship?

10:14.115 --> 10:16.623
Oh, uh, I guess you're tied.

10:17.279 --> 10:18.668
Oh, mandatory dance break!

10:18.844 --> 10:20.312
Whoo-whoo!

10:22.424 --> 10:24.470
Pew pew! Chicka-pew!

10:24.537 --> 10:27.003
And, lo, he shall pay for his arrogance

10:27.070 --> 10:28.912
as his world crumbles around him

10:28.979 --> 10:30.889
and Beaks will rue the day

10:30.956 --> 10:33.724
he heard the name Flintheart Glomgold!

10:37.214 --> 10:39.723
Oh, and Scrooge McDuck, I guess.

10:39.790 --> 10:41.550
Ooh, are you finished?

10:41.617 --> 10:44.429
What? Every evil plot starts

10:44.496 --> 10:46.685
with a "Declaration of Hatred" speech.

10:46.753 --> 10:48.610
Oh, you have so much to learn.

10:48.685 --> 10:52.046
Great. Now, can we talk
about the actual plan?

10:52.104 --> 10:53.928
I thought you'd never ask!

10:53.995 --> 10:56.568
I asked several hours ago!

10:56.685 --> 10:57.993
Behold.

10:58.060 --> 10:59.993
Our scheme to destroy Beaks

11:00.060 --> 11:01.899
begins with an invitation

11:01.966 --> 11:04.138
to a Billionaires'
Convention on a yacht.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.916
We'll tell him we're going,
but then we won't show!

11:06.974 --> 11:08.002
First slam!

11:08.060 --> 11:09.086
Seems unnecessary,

11:09.153 --> 11:11.162
especially the part about the yacht.

11:11.530 --> 11:14.516
Emotionally devastated,
Beaks will seek solace

11:14.574 --> 11:16.724
and drown his sorrows
at the buffet.

11:16.794 --> 11:19.408
A yacht and a buffet
for one person?

11:19.466 --> 11:20.924
I'm not paying for that.

11:20.982 --> 11:22.638
Fine. We'll use my yacht.

11:22.696 --> 11:26.110
Now, distracted by
delicious shrimp,

11:26.223 --> 11:29.724
Beaks won't realize he's being
sailed into an active volcano,

11:29.841 --> 11:31.334
where it'll get so hot

11:31.392 --> 11:33.119
he'll jump into the yacht's pool,

11:33.195 --> 11:36.395
which, unbeknownst to him,
will be filled with sharks!

11:36.462 --> 11:37.937
Where did the sharks come from?

11:38.004 --> 11:39.464
I've got a great shark guy.

11:39.531 --> 11:41.801
Beaks will be so
terrified by the sharks,

11:41.868 --> 11:43.587
he'll forget he's in a volcano

11:43.654 --> 11:46.505
and jump blindly into the lava!

11:46.612 --> 11:49.337
All while we watch from a bridge above.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.122
Wait, wait, I though
we wanted to boot him

11:51.189 --> 11:52.750
out of our club, not kill him!

11:52.817 --> 11:55.402
Although you have tried
to kill me countless times,

11:55.469 --> 11:57.984
which usually ends up being
more annoying than deadly.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.285
That's right, I'm a genius.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.658
Now, pay attention,

12:00.725 --> 12:02.998
'cause this is where
it gets complicated.

12:03.065 --> 12:04.182
Ooh...

12:04.240 --> 12:06.466
♪♪

12:06.571 --> 12:08.602
Listen, I got your
most important task yet.

12:08.660 --> 12:11.306
Getting my 2:15 artisanal
cold-pressed coffee.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.567
Now, I want almond-infused foam,

12:13.629 --> 12:15.035
not almonds <i>in</i> my foam.

12:15.146 --> 12:16.905
Infused foam, understood?

12:16.972 --> 12:18.181
Coffee with stuff,
got it!

12:18.248 --> 12:20.060
You don't even know
where it is!

12:25.451 --> 12:27.831
- Come on, come on...
- Almost there.

12:30.732 --> 12:32.436
Here's another XL Waddle T-shirt,

12:32.503 --> 12:34.494
a bunch of Waddle yo-yos,
and a Waddle jetpack.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.070
Don't try
it. It's super broken.

12:36.137 --> 12:38.169
Beaks, coffee! Winner!

12:38.236 --> 12:40.576
Oh, I... ahem. I'm
sorry, why am I getting

12:40.643 --> 12:42.449
my 2:15 coffee at 2:14?

12:42.516 --> 12:44.481
I didn't get an email
about it moving up.

12:44.548 --> 12:47.427
- Hello.
- Just take the coffee!

12:47.494 --> 12:49.708
I didn't become an almost-billionaire

12:49.775 --> 12:51.949
by having coffee at
random times of the day

12:52.016 --> 12:53.609
like some commoner!

12:53.676 --> 12:57.338
There's an order to
things, my order, and I...

12:57.396 --> 13:01.568
Mr. Beaks, I have your
2:15 coffee at exactly 2:15.

13:02.279 --> 13:04.861
Ooh, yummy! Man,
things got real

13:04.919 --> 13:06.853
for a second back there,
right?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.105
How is this not very real?

13:09.220 --> 13:10.658
Yeah, yeah, yeah, one sec.

13:10.716 --> 13:11.996
Kid, what's your name?

13:12.054 --> 13:13.326
Huey, sir.

13:13.537 --> 13:16.493
Ooh, don't love it.

13:18.188 --> 13:22.423
How about brand-new
Waddle intern Huey!

13:22.490 --> 13:23.608
Ha-ha!

13:23.717 --> 13:25.753
Achieve dream. Check.

13:25.897 --> 13:30.512
Now, can we finally
get to Project Tahdah?

13:31.934 --> 13:34.516
Whoa, is that an
ironically fancy briefcase

13:34.574 --> 13:36.195
in my super-chill work
environment?

13:36.262 --> 13:37.828
Uh... yes.

13:37.895 --> 13:38.961
What's going on in there,

13:39.020 --> 13:41.071
like, brilliant business
secrets?

13:41.129 --> 13:42.184
You know it!

13:42.254 --> 13:44.774
Very chill.
Oh, I like how you roll!

13:44.832 --> 13:46.727
You are my new Vice
President of Fancy Business.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.454
Intern, you report to him now.
Boom.

13:48.512 --> 13:49.595
Beaks out!

13:49.653 --> 13:50.807
- What?!
- Yes!

13:50.866 --> 13:52.415
Faked it, maked it!

13:52.473 --> 13:55.129
I didn't even know this was
my life's dream until today.

13:55.199 --> 13:58.352
But... but... how did
I win and still lose?

13:58.417 --> 14:01.481
I worked so hard and had so
many completed checklists.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.962
Do you need me
to get a briefcase?

14:03.020 --> 14:04.283
'Cause I can go get
one and then become

14:04.340 --> 14:06.172
the Vice President
of Being Chill!

14:06.239 --> 14:08.782
'Cause I'm chill.
I'm straight chilling.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.275
Like a villain, even!

14:10.342 --> 14:12.229
Oh, no,
Huey's broken.

14:12.296 --> 14:15.632
Or I could be
Chief Manager of Being Broken!

14:15.726 --> 14:17.582
'Cause anyone can just be anything!

14:17.649 --> 14:18.656
Look at me, everybody,

14:18.714 --> 14:20.624
now I'm the Duke of Making a Mess!

14:22.531 --> 14:24.281
Watch out for the Duke!

14:24.384 --> 14:26.306
Mr. Beaks, is everything okay?

14:26.372 --> 14:28.460
Uh, this again.

14:31.390 --> 14:33.250
Oh, I missed that last punch.

14:33.308 --> 14:35.176
Could you prop him
back up and do it again?

14:35.238 --> 14:39.050
No more games.
You're all my captives now.

14:39.158 --> 14:42.845
You, Vice President,
take me to Project Tahdah!

14:42.956 --> 14:44.548
Yes, of course. Sure.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.681
Um...

14:46.798 --> 14:49.465
Seriously? It's that way.

14:49.532 --> 14:51.149
It's that way.
Of course it's that way.

14:51.216 --> 14:54.275
Sorry, it's my first day,
but, eh, let's go this way.

14:54.448 --> 14:55.500
Huh!

14:57.770 --> 15:02.175
Welcome to the cutting edge
of the latest technology.

15:02.705 --> 15:04.078
See that in the air?
What is that?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.365
It's called magic!

15:05.423 --> 15:06.947
Open the vault!

15:07.005 --> 15:09.228
- Now!
- Ugh, fine! I'll

15:09.286 --> 15:11.883
"finally
take you to Project Tahdah."

15:11.941 --> 15:13.400
Blech! Ugh.

15:15.792 --> 15:18.240
Menacing man, small children,

15:18.307 --> 15:21.762
prepare yourselves for
my greatest invention.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.544
What? Nothing?

15:27.082 --> 15:31.672
Everything you think it is,
and nothing you're expecting!

15:31.730 --> 15:33.166
You got the nothing part right.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.368
So, Project Tahdah is a hoax?

15:35.426 --> 15:37.397
Tahdah!

15:37.464 --> 15:39.165
I build hype for a fake product,

15:39.232 --> 15:40.765
everyone invests in my company,

15:40.832 --> 15:42.730
kablam, I'm a billionaire!

15:43.168 --> 15:45.855
This is ridiculous.
I'm calling my employer.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.326
Go for Beaks.

15:50.185 --> 15:52.297
You've got to be kidding me!

15:52.355 --> 15:55.605
Why would you hire me to steal
something that doesn't exist?

15:55.663 --> 15:58.696
So he gets to say
Project Tahdah was stolen,

15:58.754 --> 16:00.704
but he still keeps the money!

16:00.771 --> 16:02.416
See? Fancy Business gets it.

16:02.483 --> 16:05.626
Why actually put in the hard
work of inventing something

16:05.684 --> 16:07.863
when I can just tell
everybody I did?

16:07.955 --> 16:09.676
Fake it till you make it, right?

16:11.293 --> 16:13.262
And become a billionaire!

16:13.363 --> 16:15.520
Ba-bam! Just crossed the mark.

16:15.629 --> 16:17.003
Aw, count them zeroes!

16:17.070 --> 16:18.922
One, two, three, four, five...

16:18.980 --> 16:20.104
Bah, I'm bored. You get it.

16:20.171 --> 16:22.254
And it's all thanks to you,
bud.

16:22.332 --> 16:24.223
Get over here, Selfington!

16:28.660 --> 16:30.270
I can't believe I looked up to you.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.347
You and your whole company
are as fake as Project Tahdah.

16:33.414 --> 16:35.367
Maybe,
but the money and the buzz

16:35.434 --> 16:37.698
are very, very real.

16:37.765 --> 16:39.507
I just got so many followers!

16:39.574 --> 16:41.230
- Pah!
- Gravesy, there's a helicopter

16:41.293 --> 16:42.418
waiting for you on the roof.

16:42.476 --> 16:43.777
You know what?
Keep the beanie.

16:43.851 --> 16:46.676
I do not like being lied to!

16:47.371 --> 16:49.293
Oh, this is fun. Where we going?

16:49.355 --> 16:50.395
To the roof...

16:50.551 --> 16:52.902
So I can toss you off it!

16:54.983 --> 16:56.506
Oh! Mwah, mwah, mwah.

16:56.573 --> 16:59.719
Who loves being a pawn
in my twisted evil plots?

17:00.051 --> 17:02.233
You! Yes, you do!

17:02.684 --> 17:04.689
Why on earth should
we ever need this?

17:04.756 --> 17:06.603
Well, how else is Beaks
going to know

17:06.670 --> 17:08.461
he's at the
Annual Carrot Festival?!

17:08.528 --> 17:10.582
You clearly didn't
understand the plan.

17:10.648 --> 17:12.665
Let's start from the
beginning.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.753
- Behold, our...
- No!

17:18.294 --> 17:20.498
"Backstabbing Scrooge, version 3..."

17:20.565 --> 17:21.667
What's this?

17:21.810 --> 17:23.598
Oh, I-it's nothing.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.988
This whole thing is a
trap for me, isn't it?

17:35.113 --> 17:37.270
What?! No...

17:37.340 --> 17:38.401
Of course not.

17:38.468 --> 17:41.230
Your new best friend
would never...

17:41.686 --> 17:43.301
No, stay right there.

17:45.515 --> 17:49.587
Uh, heh, thank goodness you
moved at the last minute,

17:49.645 --> 17:52.293
or you would've been
destroyed by the axe.

17:52.351 --> 17:54.137
How long have you
been planning that one?

17:54.199 --> 17:55.270
More than six months?

17:55.328 --> 17:56.337
I don't want to say.

17:56.395 --> 17:58.980
I can't believe
I wasted a whole day

17:59.047 --> 18:00.857
obsessing over
someone I don't like,

18:00.924 --> 18:02.349
and it nearly got me killed!

18:02.416 --> 18:04.563
Who am I, you? Ugh!

18:04.652 --> 18:06.751
Have fun with your new nemesis.

18:06.809 --> 18:07.955
I'm gonna go beat you both

18:08.022 --> 18:10.026
by actually being a better
billionaire.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.707
"Help.
Project Tahdah was stolen"

18:15.849 --> 18:18.842
and now I'm going
to be tossed off the roof."

18:18.909 --> 18:20.980
Oh, should I add a sad
face, or is that too much?

18:23.293 --> 18:24.793
Oh, ground.

18:25.528 --> 18:26.823
Dude, not cool!

18:26.881 --> 18:29.035
- That's my last backup phone!
- Yes!

18:30.361 --> 18:32.027
We've gotta save Beaks.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.463
Right? I mean, he's the worst,

18:34.559 --> 18:36.220
but it's the right thing to do.

18:36.355 --> 18:38.501
Why? I'm sure your biggest,
favorite friend

18:38.559 --> 18:41.113
will just fake his way through
it like everything else.

18:41.181 --> 18:44.137
Okay, first off,
that's not what BFF stands for.

18:44.238 --> 18:47.191
And secondly,
guys like him, guys like me,

18:47.301 --> 18:49.571
we have to put on a show
and fake it

18:49.629 --> 18:52.218
because smart guys like you
are so good at making it.

18:52.457 --> 18:53.898
We don't need this.

18:53.956 --> 18:56.918
What we need
is a checklist.

18:57.143 --> 18:59.373
In fact, here's a checklist
for how to get through this.

18:59.430 --> 19:02.105
One, get a plan. Two,
ask Huey for a plan.

19:02.163 --> 19:03.389
Three,
do you have a plan yet?

19:03.447 --> 19:05.734
'Cause honestly
I don't know how checklists work!

19:06.301 --> 19:07.356
I got it.

19:07.542 --> 19:08.880
Hey, Graves, over here!

19:08.940 --> 19:10.066
Wha?!

19:10.207 --> 19:11.957
This is dumb. I hate this plan.

19:13.770 --> 19:16.589
Ha-ha, I win! Oh, gross!

19:16.754 --> 19:18.996
Your dumb fingerprints
smudged my screen.

19:20.621 --> 19:22.309
Now, go be Dewey.

19:23.832 --> 19:25.004
Aaah!

19:25.086 --> 19:25.987
Take this!

19:26.108 --> 19:27.399
And all of these!

19:31.884 --> 19:33.714
- Time out!
- No.

19:34.165 --> 19:35.668
We have to take off
these stupid hats.

19:35.725 --> 19:37.197
It's humiliating.

19:38.353 --> 19:40.004
Tight end!

19:40.071 --> 19:41.657
Nyah!

19:41.724 --> 19:43.047
Dewey, whatever you do,

19:43.114 --> 19:46.160
do not tell Graves
what's in the briefcase!

19:46.227 --> 19:48.202
What <i>is</i> in the briefcase?

19:48.350 --> 19:50.261
Oh, this briefcase?

19:50.319 --> 19:52.808
Just a bunch of fancy business
secrets, very hush-hush.

19:52.866 --> 19:54.765
- You see the lock?
- Give me that.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.024
What's the code?

19:59.082 --> 20:01.209
- Try 1111.
- No.

20:01.276 --> 20:03.973
- Mmkay, 2222?
- No.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.116
Right, of course not. 3333.

20:07.183 --> 20:08.448
Oh, now you're just guessing.

20:08.578 --> 20:10.195
Have you tried
the factory default?

20:10.328 --> 20:13.064
Of course I have... Oh... kay.

20:15.826 --> 20:18.226
Doink. Ah.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.883
Oh, that's it, I'm done!

20:20.992 --> 20:24.540
And I'm untagging myself
from all those photos!

20:24.945 --> 20:27.895
That's gotta be $20 million!

20:27.970 --> 20:29.608
Where did you get a
briefcase full of money?

20:29.665 --> 20:31.576
Next to the suit of armor
in the Billionaires' Club.

20:31.633 --> 20:33.307
That place needs better security.

20:33.447 --> 20:34.713
'Sup over here?

20:34.784 --> 20:36.302
Uh, we saved your life.

20:36.472 --> 20:38.664
Right. Hey, so obviously
I have to fire you guys

20:38.722 --> 20:40.543
because you know the
secret of Project Tahdah,

20:40.610 --> 20:42.636
and if you tell anybody
I'll just say you're lying

20:42.703 --> 20:45.378
because you're mad I fired you.
Cool? Cool-cool.

20:46.260 --> 20:50.390
"My face looks like a butt."

20:50.448 --> 20:52.512
And... sent.

20:52.831 --> 20:55.164
Seriously,
that's your big plan?

20:55.222 --> 20:56.726
Who even cares about what...

20:56.784 --> 20:58.501
It already has 1,000 likes!

20:58.659 --> 21:01.257
What? No! No! I can't delete it now!

21:01.392 --> 21:03.034
Give it back! Give it back!

21:28.245 --> 21:31.370
Hah!
Me and my phone are fine!

21:31.800 --> 21:34.104
We totally crushed that fall!

21:36.753 --> 21:37.893
Aw, man!

21:37.951 --> 21:39.547
Letter for billionaire Mark Beaks.

21:39.605 --> 21:41.104
Aha, that's me!

21:44.030 --> 21:47.432
Oh, an invite to a Billionaires'
Convention on a yacht.

21:47.589 --> 21:50.347
Awesome town,
population Beaks.

21:50.633 --> 21:53.880
I still get to be a
Duckburg billionaire.

21:53.938 --> 21:57.050
And everything that
comes with it.

21:58.737 --> 22:00.190
Get the sharks ready.
