10:50.150 --> 10:52.486
SHH. SHE'LL HEAR YOU.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.862
SO? SHE LIKES ME.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.862
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.449
MOM, IT'S ME, LORELAI.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.449
I'M HOME.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.493
I'M HOME, AND I'M TAKING

10:57.491 --> 10:59.493
MY SWEATER OFF.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.287
I'M TAKING MY SWEATER OFF AND

10:59.534 --> 11:02.287
DROPPING IT ON THE FLOOR.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.498
IT'S ON THE FLOOR

11:02.329 --> 11:04.498
AND I'M WALKING AWAY.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.374
I'M LEAVING IT ON THE FLOOR.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.337
AND IN TWO YEARS, I'M GONNA

11:06.416 --> 11:10.337
REGISTER DEMOCRAT.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.547
LOOKS LIKE NO EMILY.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.547
WHERE'S SOPHIA?

11:12.589 --> 11:13.756
FIRED.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.756
ALREADY?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.008
SHE TOUCHED THE

11:13.798 --> 11:15.008
BACCARAT UNICORN.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.010
MY GOD. IS SHE INSANE?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.010
APPARENTLY SO.

11:17.051 --> 11:20.305
OKAY, SO, TO RECAP, THERE'S NO

11:17.051 --> 11:20.305
EMILY AND THERE'S NO SOPHIA.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.516
AND THERE'S NO SUPERVISION

11:20.347 --> 11:22.516
WHATSOEVER.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.142
WHAT WILL WE DO?

11:22.557 --> 11:24.142
LET'S CELEBRATE.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.519
CELEBRATE WHAT?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.519
NO MORE MIDTERMS.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.645
HEAR, HEAR!

11:26.685 --> 11:28.729
I SAY WE DRINK TO IT.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.729
HEAR, HEAR!

11:28.771 --> 11:29.856
SCOTCH, VODKA, OR GIN?

11:29.897 --> 11:31.566
HEAR, HEAR!

11:29.897 --> 11:31.566
OKAY.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.318
AND PUT A CHERRY IN IT.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.945
LOOKS LIKE THE GILMORES ARE

11:33.360 --> 11:35.945
PLANNING A TRIP AGAIN.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.656
WHERE TO THIS TIME?

11:37.696 --> 11:40.074
SOMEPLACE FABULOUS.

11:37.696 --> 11:40.074
THEY'LL STAY AT A

11:37.696 --> 11:40.074
FANCY RICH HOTEL

11:40.116 --> 11:43.828
SO THEY WON'T HAVE TO TALK

11:40.116 --> 11:43.828
TO ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY

11:40.116 --> 11:43.828
LIVES IN THAT COUNTRY.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.747
OH. "MYRA WALDO'S TRAVEL AND

11:43.870 --> 11:46.747
MOTORING GUIDE TO EUROPE."

11:46.789 --> 11:49.543
HELLO, MYRA.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.543
OH, GOD, I HOPE THEY

11:46.789 --> 11:49.543
GO OVER CHRISTMAS.

11:49.584 --> 11:53.296
THAT WOULD BE AS HOLLY JOLLY

11:49.584 --> 11:53.296
AS IT GETS.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.589
SMOOTH.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.675
HEY, GUESS WHAT I DECIDED.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.010
I'M NOT GONNA GO TO COLLEGE.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.010
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.304
I'M TAKING A YEAR,

11:59.052 --> 12:01.304
AND I'M GOING TO EUROPE.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.057
I'M GONNA BACKPACK, SLEEP

12:01.346 --> 12:04.057
ON A BENCH, SEE THE WORLD.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.560
AND YOU'VE TOLD STROBE

12:04.098 --> 12:06.560
AND FRANCINE ABOUT YOUR PLANS?

12:06.601 --> 12:10.188
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:06.601 --> 12:10.188
I'M OUT OF HERE THE SECOND

12:06.601 --> 12:10.188
THAT DIPLOMA'S IN MY HAND.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.690
SOUNDS GOOD.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.690
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.400
OH, I AM?

12:11.730 --> 12:13.400
YEP.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.985
I'M SLEEPING ON A BENCH?

12:13.441 --> 12:15.985
HOW DOES THAT PICTURE LOOK?

12:16.027 --> 12:19.072
IT LOOKS

12:16.027 --> 12:19.072
LIKE A BIG "NO."

12:16.027 --> 12:19.072
YOU, WE GET A ROOM FOR.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.575
I'LL JUST SLEEP ON

12:19.113 --> 12:21.575
THE BENCH OUTSIDE.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.575
MUCH BETTER ARRANGEMENT.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.951
SO YOU'LL GO?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.951
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

12:21.616 --> 12:23.951
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.579
I'M SUPPOSED TO

12:23.993 --> 12:25.579
GO TO COLLEGE.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.122
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO JOIN YOUR

12:25.620 --> 12:28.122
DAD'S FIRM WHERE YOU GET

12:28.164 --> 12:30.041
A BIG STICK TO SHOVE

12:28.164 --> 12:30.041
UP YOUR BUTT.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.252
CHANGE OF PLANS.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.252
YOU CAN'T JUST

12:30.083 --> 12:32.252
CHANGE THE PLANS.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.338
THE PLANS CAME OVER

12:32.293 --> 12:35.338
ON THE<i> MAYFLOWER.</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:35.338
LET'S GET OUT.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.425
LET'S GET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.425
LET'S TAKE MYRA AND JUST BOLT.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.594
LEAVE A NOTE --

12:38.466 --> 12:40.594
"DEAR RICHARD AND EMILY,

12:40.635 --> 12:42.637
"I DON'T BELONG HERE.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.637
I'M GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.515
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE."

12:42.679 --> 12:45.515
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

12:45.557 --> 12:48.602
WELL, THE WORD "WHOOPEE"

12:45.557 --> 12:48.602
COMES TO MIND.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.353
SO, THEN, IT'S A PLAN.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.938
IT'S A PLAN.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.487
HEY, I WANT TO SLEEP AMONGST

12:56.984 --> 12:59.487
13th-CENTURY TAPESTRIES

12:59.529 --> 13:01.155
AND CHOCOLATES

12:59.529 --> 13:01.155
MADE BY LOCAL ARTISANS.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.700
OKAY, THEN IT'S SETTLED.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.700
WE'RE NOT STAYING AT ANY PLACE

13:03.742 --> 13:05.535
THAT WASN'T BUILT FOR

13:03.742 --> 13:05.535
NAPOLEON III'S DOCTOR

13:05.577 --> 13:07.662
OR DOESN'T HAVE A CHAGALL

13:05.577 --> 13:07.662
IN THE BATHROOM.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.456
HEAR, HEAR!

13:09.497 --> 13:12.709
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

13:09.497 --> 13:12.709
HOW WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.877
HEY, HOW GOOD'S YOUR

13:12.751 --> 13:14.877
ORGAN GRINDING?

13:19.299 --> 13:22.218
I CALLED HER LAST NIGHT

13:19.299 --> 13:22.218
AND SHE SAID SHE WAS BUSY.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.011
SHE'S DEFINITELY

13:22.260 --> 13:24.011
GOT A BOYFRIEND.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.011
I KNOW.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.930
I THINK

13:24.053 --> 13:25.930
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.930
I AGREE.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.016
IT WASN'T HEALTHY.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.016
DIDN'T HELP THE SKIN THING

13:25.972 --> 13:29.016
SHE WAS GOING THROUGH.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.978
WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL US?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.978
SHE FIRST WANTED

13:29.058 --> 13:31.978
TO MAKE SURE.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.355
SO, TELL US...

13:34.397 --> 13:38.526
WHAT'S THIS JAMIE LIKE?

13:34.397 --> 13:38.526
I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING

13:34.397 --> 13:38.526
ABOUT PARIS RIGHT NOW...OR EVER.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.860
YOU KNOW HIM.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.860
WE DON'T.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.946
IS HE SEXY?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.946
DOES HE HAVE A CAR?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.240
WILL THE PROM PICTURES WORK?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.240
HOW ARE HIS FRIENDS?

13:44.282 --> 13:47.076
YES, IS THERE

13:44.282 --> 13:47.076
SPIN-OFF POTENTIAL?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.745
WHOOPS.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.745
BYE.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.330
OKAY, EVERYONE.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.330
GATHER AROUND.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.082
I HAVE IN MY HAND THE 2002

13:50.371 --> 13:53.082
FRANKLIN YEARBOOK PHOTOS.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.627
I GOT COPIES FOR EVERYONE,

13:53.124 --> 13:55.627
SO LET'S LEAVE THE BARNEY'S

13:55.669 --> 13:58.087
CLEARANCE SALE RE-ENACTMENT

13:55.669 --> 13:58.087
FOR ANOTHER DAY, SHALL WE?

13:58.129 --> 14:00.881
AND TAKE NOTE OF THE FACT

13:58.129 --> 14:00.881
THAT THE IDEA OF POSING

14:00.923 --> 14:03.718
UNDER THE NEW SCHOOL BANNER

14:00.923 --> 14:03.718
WAS A MAJOR, MAJOR SUCCESS.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.843
UM, PARIS?

14:03.760 --> 14:04.843
YES.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.513
I'M SNEEZING.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.513
WHAT?

14:06.554 --> 14:09.140
IN THE PICTURE I'M SNEEZING

14:06.554 --> 14:09.140
AND MY HEAD IS TURNED.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.685
I NOTICED BUT EVERY PICTURE

14:09.182 --> 14:11.685
HAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.936
I HAD TO PICK

14:11.726 --> 14:13.936
THE BEST ONES.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.689
WE TOOK 90 PICTURES.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.689
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

14:15.730 --> 14:18.483
MY POINT IS, IN 90 TRIES, THERE

14:15.730 --> 14:18.483
WASN'T ONE OTHER PICTURE

14:18.525 --> 14:21.569
THAT DIDN'T HAVE ME LOOKING

14:18.525 --> 14:21.569
LIKE I'M IN CIRQUE DU SOLEIL?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.030
SORRY. LIFE CAN PLAY SOME

14:21.611 --> 14:24.030
CRUEL TRICKS SOMETIMES.

14:24.071 --> 14:27.033
LIFE HAD A LITTLE HELP FROM

14:24.071 --> 14:27.033
THE GELLER CAMP THIS TIME.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.160
WE ARE NOT DONE.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.623
HELLO?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.623
RORY, HI.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.958

14:38.503 --> 14:41.381
SHERRY'S FRIEND.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.383
OH. YES. RIGHT. MAUREEN.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.176
I'M SORRY.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.176
Don't worry about it.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.012
I KNOW THE INVITATION SAID WE

14:45.218 --> 14:48.012
WERE ALL GATHERING NEXT WEEK,

14:48.054 --> 14:49.472
BUT SHERRY JUST

14:48.054 --> 14:49.472
WENT INTO LABOR.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.391
WHAT?

14:49.514 --> 14:51.391
SHE SCREWED UP.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.391
SHE'S IN LABOR.

14:51.432 --> 14:55.102
SHE WANTED ME TO CALL

14:51.432 --> 14:55.102
THE GIRLS TO GET DOWN

14:51.432 --> 14:55.102
TO THE HOSPITAL NOW.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.979
OH.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.979
It's a big screw-up.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.606
I GUESS.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.606
CAN YOU COME?

14:58.648 --> 15:00.274
You're a child, right?

14:58.648 --> 15:00.274
WHAT?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.944
SCHOOL? YOU HAVE SCHOOL?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.944
YES, I HAVE SCHOOL, BUT --

15:03.986 --> 15:07.031
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD

15:03.986 --> 15:07.031
RESCHEDULE SCHOOL FOR TODAY?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.116
She screwed up,

15:07.073 --> 15:09.116
but she's still our Sherry.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.370
I'M ACTUALLY DONE WITH SCHOOL.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.370
I COULD GRAB A TRAIN --

15:12.412 --> 15:15.790
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST,

15:12.412 --> 15:15.790
THE ABSOLUTE BEST.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.790
YOU ARE A GREAT KID.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.209
SHE'S AT BOSTON MEMORIAL.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.209
I WILL MEET YOU THERE.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.561

15:32.640 --> 15:36.561
I WANT A LUMINOUS QUALITY.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.980
I'M HAVE TO SEE THE HER

15:36.603 --> 15:39.980

15:47.238 --> 15:50.408
YOU WANT ME TO GO

15:47.238 --> 15:50.408
UP THERE AGAIN?

15:47.238 --> 15:50.408
NO, I'LL DO IT.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.202
I SWEAR YOU THINK IT WAS

15:50.450 --> 15:53.202
MY COMING-OUT PORTRAIT NOT HERS

15:53.244 --> 15:55.455

15:53.244 --> 15:55.455
SHE HAS ABOUT THIS.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.165
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:07.842 --> 16:08.885
NEEDS YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.261
I'LL BE THERE IN A SEC.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.681
HE NEEDS YOU NOW,

16:10.303 --> 16:13.681
NOT IN A SEC.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.681
OKAY.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.601
I DON'T HEAR YOU WALKING

16:13.723 --> 16:16.601
TOWARD THE DOOR.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.601
MOM, PLEASE.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.352
I'M COMING IN.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.352
NO!

16:18.394 --> 16:20.730
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR

16:18.394 --> 16:20.730
ATTITUDE, YOUNG LADY.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.982
THIS MAN IS BEING PAID

16:20.772 --> 16:22.982
BY THE HOUR.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.903
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?

16:23.023 --> 16:26.903
I THINK THE ZIPPER'S TOO NEW

16:23.023 --> 16:26.903
OR STIFF OR SOMETHING.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.529
TURN AROUND.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.529
I'LL DO IT.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.743
OH, MY GOD.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.743
WHAT?

16:33.785 --> 16:36.329
IT'S NOT THE ZIPPER.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.329
IT'S THE DRESS.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.329
IT'S TOO SMALL.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.665
ARE YOU SURE?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.665
OF COURSE, I'M SURE.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.082
HOW CAN IT BE TOO SMALL?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.918
WE HAD A FITTING

16:40.124 --> 16:41.918
THREE MONTHS AGO.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.753
HAVE YOU GAINED WEIGHT?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.753
NO!

16:43.795 --> 16:46.005
HOLD YOUR BREATH.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.005
I AM.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.424
HOLD YOUR BREATH.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.424
I AM.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.885
I THINK THE DRESSMAKER

16:48.466 --> 16:50.885
MUST HAVE WRITTEN

16:50.927 --> 16:52.553
THE MEASUREMENTS

16:50.927 --> 16:52.553
DOWN WRONG.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.263
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED

16:52.595 --> 16:54.263
TO DO NOW?

16:54.305 --> 16:58.058
I CAN'T TAKE A PICTURE

16:54.305 --> 16:58.058
OF YOU LIKE THAT.

16:54.305 --> 16:58.058
I'M SORRY.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.603
I'LL JUST HAVE TO HAVE

16:58.100 --> 17:00.603
HIM COME BACK NEXT WEEK.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.190
I'M GONNA CALL THAT DRESS SHOP

17:00.645 --> 17:04.190
AND GIVE HER A PIECE OF MY MIND.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.900
IS EVERYONE IN THE WORLD

17:04.231 --> 17:05.900
COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT?

17:05.942 --> 17:08.194
PUT ON YOUR SWEATS

17:05.942 --> 17:08.194
AND RUN AROUND THE BLOCK.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.947
YOU'RE GONNA FIT INTO THE NEXT

17:08.235 --> 17:10.947
DRESS, NO MATTER WHAT.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.505
I HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO DRINK

17:24.627 --> 17:27.505
AS MUCH COFFEE AS I CAN

17:27.547 --> 17:32.051
BEFORE I GO AND SPEND THE

17:27.547 --> 17:32.051
EVENING WITH MY MOTHER ALONE.

17:27.547 --> 17:32.051
WHO AM I SAYING THIS TO?

17:32.092 --> 17:33.052
I WAS LISTENING.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.013
WHERE'S LUKE?

17:33.093 --> 17:35.013
I DON'T KNOW.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.472
HOW FRESH IS THAT POT?

17:36.514 --> 17:38.474
IT WAS SITTING

17:36.514 --> 17:38.474
THERE WHEN I GOT HERE,

17:38.516 --> 17:41.268
BUT THAT'S ONLY BEEN A MINUTE,

17:38.516 --> 17:41.268
SO I DON'T KNOW.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.564
HEY, I DESPERATELY NEED A

17:41.310 --> 17:44.564
MASSIVE CUP OF COFFEE TO GO.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.941
WHAT HAPPENED

17:44.605 --> 17:46.941
TO YOUR FACE?

17:44.605 --> 17:46.941
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:46.983 --> 17:49.109
IT'S VISIBLE.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.109
I SHAVED.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.695
YOU GOING TO THE BANK?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.695
NO.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.406
FUNERAL? DRAG CLUB?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.406
NO. LET'S GET YOU

17:50.737 --> 17:53.406
YOUR COFFEE.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.366
ISN'T THAT THE SWEATER --

17:53.447 --> 17:55.366
YES, IT IS.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.784
YOU LOOK NICE.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.784
THANK YOU.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.703
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.703
OH, WELL.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.787
Nicole: HI.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.787

18:09.923 --> 18:11.465
I'M READY.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.842
OH, I'M SORRY.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.842

18:12.884 --> 18:14.719
HEY. HEY, LUKE --

18:17.221 --> 18:19.682
HELLO? YES.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.184
NO, MONDAY'S NOT GONNA WORK.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.184
IT'LL HAVE TO BE TUESDAY.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.979
YES, YOUR CLIENT BREAKING

18:22.226 --> 18:24.979
HIS CONTRACT IS FAIRLY

18:22.226 --> 18:24.979
ANNOYING ALSO,

18:25.021 --> 18:26.647
BUT WE'RE ALL DEALING

18:25.021 --> 18:26.647

18:38.868 --> 18:41.579
ALRIGHT, BYE.

18:42.705 --> 18:43.706
MAUREEN?

18:43.748 --> 18:44.832
YES?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.960
I'M RORY.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.920
I'M CHRISTOPHER'S DAUGHTER.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.920
YOU CALLED ME DOWN...

18:48.962 --> 18:51.130
RORY, YES, SWEETIE,

18:48.962 --> 18:51.130
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.924
SHERRY'S GONNA BE

18:51.171 --> 18:52.924
HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.301
SHE'S A BASKET CASE.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.301
WELL, WHO WOULDN'T BE, RIGHT?

18:55.342 --> 18:56.928
WHERE'S EVERYONE ELSE?

18:55.342 --> 18:56.928
THEY'RE WORKING.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.806
WHAT?

18:56.970 --> 18:59.806
WE PLANNED NEXT WEEK,

18:56.970 --> 18:59.806
BUT SHERRY SCREWED UP.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.641
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.641
SHE'LL BE THRILLED.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.517
SHE'S FEELING ABANDONED.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.517
SHE'S RIGHT IN THERE.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.311
DO NOT MENTION

19:03.559 --> 19:05.311
HOW FAT SHE IS.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.731
SHE'S EXTREMELY SENSITIVE

19:05.352 --> 19:08.731
ABOUT THAT TODAY. OKAY, KISS.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.567
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.567
WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

19:11.609 --> 19:14.779
I'VE GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.779
I'M SWAMPED.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.779
YOU'RE LEAVING ME ALONE?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.906
I WOULD LOVE TO STAY, HON.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.906
IMPOSSIBLE.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.283
SHERRY SCREWED UP.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.283
ANYHOW YOU'LL BE FINE.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.660
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, CALL.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.037
I DON'T HAVE YOUR NUMBER.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.037
SHERRY'S GOT IT!

19:29.127 --> 19:31.337
SHERRY? IT'S RORY.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.673
RORY? OH, MY GOD.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.673
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.425
HOW ARE YOU?

19:33.714 --> 19:36.425
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED

19:33.714 --> 19:36.425
TO HAPPEN NOW.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.344
I KNOW.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.344
CHRISTOPHER'S OUT OF TOWN.

19:38.385 --> 19:42.515
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:38.385 --> 19:42.515
BECAUSE HE'S NOT HERE.

19:38.385 --> 19:42.515
WHERE'S MAUREEN?

19:42.556 --> 19:45.768
SHE WENT BACK TO WORK,

19:42.556 --> 19:45.768
SHE'LL CALL YOU LATER.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.768
SHE'S AT WORK?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.770
YES.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.770
I'M LYING IN A BED.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.563
GOD KNOWS WHAT'S

19:47.812 --> 19:49.563
GONNA HAPPEN.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.942
WELL, YOU'RE GOING

19:49.605 --> 19:52.942
TO HAVE A BABY.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.942
AND SHE GOES BACK TO WORK.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.403
I'D LOVE TO DO THAT,

19:52.984 --> 19:56.403
BUT I CAN'T.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.403
I HAVE TO STAY HERE.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.824
WELL, YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE

19:56.445 --> 19:59.824
GOING TO HAVE A BABY.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.824
SHE'S NOT HERE.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.868
NONE OF MY FRIENDS ARE HERE.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.745
CHRISTOPHER ISN'T HERE.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.745
NO ONE IS HERE.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.247
NO ONE BUT YOU.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.916
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE, RORY.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.251
I DON'T THINK THAT

20:08.958 --> 20:11.251
I COULD DO THIS ALONE

20:11.293 --> 20:14.630
BECAUSE THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED

20:11.293 --> 20:14.630
TO HAPPEN UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.630
I WROTE IT DOWN!

20:14.672 --> 20:17.758
I WROTE IT DOWN.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.758
I WROTE IT DOWN!

20:17.800 --> 20:19.177
[ CRYING ]

20:20.511 --> 20:22.180
BOY, DO YOU LOOK THIN.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.810
IT'S A RARE TREAT TO

20:25.474 --> 20:27.810
HAVE AN EVENING ALONE

20:27.852 --> 20:29.269
WITH MY DAUGHTER UNCOERCED.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.314
YES, IT IS, ISN'T IT?

20:29.311 --> 20:32.314
SO RORY'S AT THE HOSPITAL?

20:32.356 --> 20:35.568
YEAH, SHE'S GONNA SEE HER NEW

20:32.356 --> 20:35.568
HALF SISTER FRESH FROM THE OVEN.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.237
THAT'S ABOUT AS UNPLEASANT A

20:35.609 --> 20:38.237
DESCRIPTION AS I'VE EVER HEARD.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.322
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE

20:38.278 --> 20:40.322
MARTINIS.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.322
VERY GOOD THOUGHT.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.033
OLIVES?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.033
TWIST.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.577
SO, HOW'S RORY FEELING ABOUT

20:42.075 --> 20:44.577
CHRISTOPHER'S NEW BABY?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.746
SHE'S VERY EXCITED.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.746
IT'S KIND OF CUTE.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.165
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT

20:46.787 --> 20:49.165
HER A PUPPY.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.165
STOP.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.833
NO MAID TONIGHT?

20:50.875 --> 20:53.377
LELONI USUALLY TAKES SUNDAYS

20:50.875 --> 20:53.377
OFF, BUT SHE WANTED TO SWITCH.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.462
SEEING AS IT'S JUST

20:53.419 --> 20:55.462
US, I SAID YES.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.382
LELONI, HUH?

20:55.504 --> 20:58.382
VERY EXOTIC NAME.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.382
SHE'S FROM HONOLULU.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.467
DOES SHE KNOW DON HO?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.467
CHARO?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.467
NO.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.095
THE C&amp;H PURE CANE

21:00.509 --> 21:02.095
SUGAR DANCERS?

21:02.136 --> 21:05.181
LORELAI, PLEASE, WE DON'T

21:02.136 --> 21:05.181
HAVE A BUFFER HERE TONIGHT.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.515
SO, WHO COOKED DINNER?

21:06.557 --> 21:08.350
UGH, PLEASE DON'T

21:06.557 --> 21:08.350
TELL ME IT'S YOU

21:08.392 --> 21:10.019
'CAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS DIET.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.896
LELONI MADE A ROAST

21:10.061 --> 21:11.896
BEFORE SHE LEFT,

21:11.938 --> 21:14.065
AND I HEATED IT UP.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.065
YOU DID?

21:14.107 --> 21:17.401
I EVEN ADDED WINE TO THE PAN

21:14.107 --> 21:17.401
TO KEEP IT FROM DRYING OUT.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.862
WELL, WHO DIED AND

21:17.443 --> 21:19.862
MADE YOU SARA MOULTON?

21:19.904 --> 21:22.990
DRINK THIS AND BE QUIET.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.952
SO, UM, HOW LONG'S DAD

21:23.032 --> 21:25.952
GONE FOR THIS TIME?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.912
TWO WEEKS.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.912
DIDN'T HE JUST BACK?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.456
YES, HE DID.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.456
SO, BUSINESS MUST BE

21:27.954 --> 21:30.456
PRETTY GOOD.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.084
I SUPPOSE, HE HAS TO WORK

21:30.497 --> 21:33.084
TWICE AS HARD,

21:33.126 --> 21:35.878
I'M STILL NOT SURE THAT

21:33.126 --> 21:35.878
HE'S ACTUALLY MADE A DIME YET.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.964
HOWEVER, HE'S HAVING

21:35.920 --> 21:37.964
THE TIME OF HIS LIFE,

21:38.005 --> 21:40.800
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?

21:38.005 --> 21:40.800
NOTHING, I GUESS.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.636
HEY, MOM, CAN I ASK

21:40.841 --> 21:43.636
YOU SOMETHING?

21:40.841 --> 21:43.636
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.847
WHAT DO YOU DO

21:43.677 --> 21:46.847
WHILE DAD IS GONE?
