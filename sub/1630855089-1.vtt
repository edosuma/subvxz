[Amanda] Hi, Amanda Riley here
from Tourista World Travel.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.166
Yes. Yes, it's gonna be okay, Mrs. Smith.

00:37.250 --> 00:40.541
Yes, I understand,
we are working as fast as we can.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.833
God, I miss smoking in a crisis.

00:42.916 --> 00:45.333
Ah, bingo. Mrs. Smith just sent a photo.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.708
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

00:51.333 --> 00:52.625
No, seriously,

00:53.208 --> 00:54.333
what do we have here?

00:55.666 --> 00:57.125
Ah, that's it.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.958
Mrs. Smith, it is your lucky day.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.958
We know where you and Mr. Smith are.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.500
Ye-- Yes, you have boarded
the wrong booze cruise.

01:06.916 --> 01:10.208
Sure, I guess the tour group shirts
do kind of look alike.

01:11.291 --> 01:12.125
Ooh.

01:12.208 --> 01:15.291
Yes, we are rerouting the tour now
to pick you up immediately.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.125
[Mona] Never a dull moment.

01:17.208 --> 01:18.958
Well done, Amanda.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.208
Our other Monday crisis, Vietnam.

01:25.291 --> 01:28.750
It's on this year's list
of top ten dream vacations.

01:28.833 --> 01:30.791
We keep losing clients to other companies

01:30.875 --> 01:33.958
because we don't have
one tour bus on the ground there.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.208
Yet.

01:36.291 --> 01:39.000
I like this tone of intrigue.
What have you got?

01:39.083 --> 01:40.041
Saigon Silver Star.

01:40.125 --> 01:43.333
It's a small, family-run tour company.
The owner's thinking of selling.

01:43.416 --> 01:47.500
It's a little under the radar,
but it's got fantastic online reviews.

01:47.583 --> 01:50.541
Who do we send as a secret shopper
to see if it's worth bidding on?

01:50.625 --> 01:54.083
Well, I would like to send you, but
I've a feeling you're about to be busy.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.833
-Busy?
-Mm-hmm.

01:56.916 --> 02:00.833
John called. He wants to make sure
you come home early, not working late.

02:00.916 --> 02:04.541
He's clearly got something planned,
so I booked you a 4:00 p.m. manicure.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.500
Manicure? I'm-- I'm not following.

02:08.375 --> 02:11.250
You're not following?
You two have been together forever.

02:11.333 --> 02:15.250
But-- I mean,
five years isn't "forever forever."

02:15.333 --> 02:17.958
And he wants you
to come home early all of the sudden.

02:18.041 --> 02:20.375
The man is clearly putting a ring on it.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.833

02:35.125 --> 02:37.833
-So you're saying it's a special occasion?
-Potentially.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.041
It's your hand.

02:44.833 --> 02:48.166

that my boyfriend is proposing tonight.

I don't know exactly what I thought,

but I kind of feel like this day
was never gonna come, you know?

02:57.583 --> 03:00.125
John and I have both
been really focused on our careers.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.250
-He has a job? That's cool.
-Yeah.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.500
He's an accountant.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.041
He's been on this really complex
tax fraud case.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.208
-My boyfriend was in one of those.
-Oh.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.333
But not as an accountant.

03:10.416 --> 03:12.583
Do you… wanna talk about it?

03:12.666 --> 03:13.791
-No.
-Okay.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.791
Can't. Court order.

03:16.541 --> 03:19.833
Also, my bosses said
manicure time is the customer's time, so…

03:21.375 --> 03:22.708
Tell me your big love story.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.083
Our first date
was at a paint and sip art night.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.125
John paid with a coupon, which was cool.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.625
And then we painted sunflowers.

03:31.708 --> 03:34.750
Well, actually, it turns out
we're both really terrible at paint,

03:34.833 --> 03:37.416
but very good at sip,
so at least we had that in common.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.875
But I really knew
that he was the one a couple weeks later

03:40.958 --> 03:43.000
when he offered to do my taxes.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.000
Taxes.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.041
Hot.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.041
It's his love language. [chuckles]

03:48.125 --> 03:49.083
Wow.

03:49.166 --> 03:51.166
So he's like a real, grown-up man.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.458
Exactly.

03:52.541 --> 03:55.333
And we're just--
We're so comfortable together, you know?

03:55.416 --> 03:56.875
It's just-- It's really good.

03:56.958 --> 04:01.625
I cannot believe that a year from now,
I am going to be hitched.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.916
[chuckles] And I, like, I work in travel,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.250
so I will have hopefully
planned and executed the ideal honeymoon,

04:07.333 --> 04:10.958
and we'll just be
settling into our new normal.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.708
Maybe even looking for a house.

04:12.791 --> 04:14.333
Oh my God.

04:14.416 --> 04:15.833
Did you decide on a color yet?

04:15.916 --> 04:16.750
Oh, right.

04:16.833 --> 04:17.666
Um…

04:17.750 --> 04:18.583
Ooh.

04:18.666 --> 04:19.625
What about red?

04:19.708 --> 04:23.458
Red's a statement. It's fiery, you know?
Who doesn't like a fiery statement?

04:23.541 --> 04:26.500
Or something different. More like a--

04:26.583 --> 04:27.958
Oh, a blue.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.750
Something borrowed, something blue.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.083
I don't follow.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.583
It's… an expression. Doesn't matter.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.583
This one. This is it. It's a classic.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.166
That's the color you wore in.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.458
Exactly. It is neutral, it is reliable.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.250
It goes with every outfit.
I mean, this color is your wing woman.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.500
Just to confirm,

11:26.333 --> 11:28.583
are you certain that's not your bag?

11:31.750 --> 11:32.583
[man] Next.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.750
Just so you know,
there's a better way to do this.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.625
I know a guy who knows a guy.

11:40.625 --> 11:44.291
Wait, you know a guy who knows a guy who--

11:44.375 --> 11:45.666
Who can get your bag back.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.625
[chuckles] That's okay.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.791
I think we should just leave it
to the airline professionals.

11:50.875 --> 11:51.750
Okay.

11:51.833 --> 11:52.708
[man] Next.

11:54.958 --> 11:57.750
Hi, I'm Amanda, and you are?

11:57.833 --> 11:58.708
Yes.

12:00.416 --> 12:01.708
Really great at your job.

12:01.791 --> 12:03.750
Employee of the month every month, I bet.

12:04.541 --> 12:07.708
Why did I do that?
Anyway, hi, I seem to have lost my bag.

12:07.791 --> 12:10.333
It is a silver bag, it is a roller bag,

12:10.416 --> 12:12.833
and I really need to get it back
as soon as possible--

12:12.916 --> 12:14.375
We will call you.

12:14.458 --> 12:18.333
Oh, okay, great,
like in an hour? Maybe two--

12:18.416 --> 12:19.333
Next.

12:20.958 --> 12:22.125
Thank you so much.

12:22.791 --> 12:23.625
Yes.

12:23.708 --> 12:24.583
Right.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.208
Hi.

12:26.291 --> 12:28.541
[humming]

12:29.583 --> 12:30.416
[Sinh] Hey!

12:32.166 --> 12:35.375
Hey, finally.
I was about to give up on you two.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.750
Amanda, my cousin, Anh.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.458
Her dad, my uncle,
owns Saigon Silver Star.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.541
Oh, so that kind of makes you Sinh's boss.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.416
[Anh, chuckling] Hey.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.750
I like your style.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.958
Um, no luggage?

12:48.041 --> 12:50.333
It seems like the airline
might have lost my bag.

12:50.416 --> 12:52.375
Don't worry, Sinh knows a guy.

12:52.458 --> 12:53.916
So I've heard.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.375
[woman speaking Vietnamese]

12:58.541 --> 12:59.916
Corporate tour groups.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.291
Joke's on them.

13:01.375 --> 13:04.250
They're not gonna experience
the real Vietnam, not like you.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.250
Right.

13:05.791 --> 13:09.458
Do, uh, do you guys happen
to offer welcome water?

13:09.541 --> 13:10.666
We'll get some at the hotel.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.291
Could we go over the itinerary on the way?

13:13.375 --> 13:16.833
Just relax and enjoy the view.
Sinh handles everything.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.333
Okay, and, uh, what do you do?

13:20.416 --> 13:21.500
What I do best.

13:22.708 --> 13:23.708
I drive.

13:24.958 --> 13:28.875
["GPS" by Pixel Neko playing]

14:13.041 --> 14:13.875
Thank you.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.416
Wow, this is a great view.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.541
[Sinh] It's even more
amazing from the roof.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.583
We have a group meet and greet
at seven o'clock.

14:24.666 --> 14:28.791
Are we gonna go over the itinerary then?
There's just so much to see.

14:28.875 --> 14:32.125
I mean, Notre Dame,
Saigon Central Post Office--

14:32.208 --> 14:34.583
Slow down, slow down.
I decide the schedule.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.041
You chose a tour, remember?

14:36.125 --> 14:37.291
That means no homework.

14:37.375 --> 14:41.333
Does that mean you're not even gonna peek
at my beautifully prepared agenda?

14:41.416 --> 14:42.250
It has tabs.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.583
Sure.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.416
Is there anything else you need
before your bag arrives?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.666
Let's see if it arrives.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.333
Oh. You have zero faith.

14:51.416 --> 14:53.500
No, you're right, I absolutely do not,

14:53.583 --> 14:55.916
which is why I always pack

14:56.000 --> 14:58.791
both my toiletries and…

14:58.875 --> 15:00.125
[sighs, kisses]

15:00.208 --> 15:02.000
…a clean shirt in my carry-on.

15:02.083 --> 15:05.041
-I'm impressed.
-Well, what can I say. I was a Girl Scout.

15:05.666 --> 15:06.958
Thin Mints or Samoas?

15:07.791 --> 15:09.625
-Samoas, of course.
-Samoas?

15:09.708 --> 15:11.291
-Yeah.
-No, Thin Mints all the way.

15:11.375 --> 15:14.583
What? Silly me over here
thinking we could be friends.

15:14.666 --> 15:15.875
[chuckles]

15:15.958 --> 15:17.833
So, how do you know so much
about Girl Scouts?

15:17.916 --> 15:20.416
I spent a big part
of my childhood in the US.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.541
Many Thin Mints were consumed.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.583
I'll see you up there. Oh, and,

15:25.250 --> 15:27.583
whatever you do, don't nap.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.250
Fight it at all cost.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.500
It's the only way to survive jet lag.

15:31.583 --> 15:32.458
Okay.

15:33.208 --> 15:34.250

15:35.125 --> 15:35.958
Don't nap.

15:40.666 --> 15:44.833
["Cho Không" by Suboi playing]

15:50.583 --> 15:51.833
Someone napped after all.

15:51.916 --> 15:55.708

I woke up.

15:55.791 --> 15:57.833
I felt like I didn't even know
my own name.

-I can help you with that. Amanda Riley.
-Mm.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.916
I can also help you with a drink.
Does it have a name?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.375
Uh, white wine?

and our daughter, Robin,

16:21.083 --> 16:24.041
Excuse me? We flew
halfway across the world for this trip.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.750
Oh, I have to get off my phone
but Mom doesn't?

16:26.833 --> 16:30.125
Hey, Mama's right, this is family time.

sending work emails under the table.

16:35.541 --> 16:38.000
I'm sorry.
We're very civilized, I promise.

-Hey.

He's allowed to use his phone.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.708

along on the adventure with me. Hi.

for agricultural engineering.

-Hi.

-Hey.

17:16.791 --> 17:20.333
-[Sam] Nice to meet you.
-So, uh, what brings you to Vietnam?

17:20.416 --> 17:23.250
Well, it's… it's our honeymoon.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.958
Your honeymoon? That's so romantic.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.833
Well, we got married 40 years ago,
but we were broke then,

17:30.916 --> 17:34.166
but now we're retired, so here we are.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.875
-Better late than never.
-Oh.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.750
[Brian chuckles]

17:39.833 --> 17:42.125
And what brings you to Vietnam?

17:43.125 --> 17:44.958
I just needed to get away.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.791
Yeah, just-- [exhales] You know?

17:48.250 --> 17:51.291
You just got dumped, didn't you? What?

17:51.375 --> 17:55.083
I-- What makes you…
What makes you say that?

17:55.166 --> 17:59.333
I mean, you're traveling alone,
making smart alcohol choices.

17:59.416 --> 18:03.000
Obviously a man very foolishly
allowed you to slip through his fingers.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.125
I just really needed a vacation. You know?

18:06.208 --> 18:08.125
Just anything
to get away from work, right?

18:08.208 --> 18:09.458
What is your line of work?

18:10.375 --> 18:11.375
Uh…

18:11.458 --> 18:13.333
I have an idea. This will be fun.

18:13.416 --> 18:16.083
How about we don't talk
about work at all, and at the end,

18:16.166 --> 18:18.208
we can all guess what everybody does?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.458
-Oh, no work talk.
-Okay.

18:20.541 --> 18:22.291
I like the sound of that.

18:23.041 --> 18:25.666
I bet you don't wanna
talk about it 'cause you can't.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.333
You're detail-oriented.

18:27.416 --> 18:29.208
You've got travel experience.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.208
Let me guess.

18:32.666 --> 18:34.708
-You're an assassin.
-[all chuckle]

18:34.791 --> 18:35.625
Spy.

18:36.958 --> 18:37.875
Stylish fugitive.

18:37.958 --> 18:40.750
I can confirm or deny nothing.

18:40.833 --> 18:41.875
[all chuckle]

18:41.958 --> 18:43.375
It'll all come out in the end.

18:44.666 --> 18:49.375
Welcome to the Saigon Silver Star Family,
which happens to be my family.

18:50.208 --> 18:53.208
You're especially lucky
because your trip lands on Tet,

18:53.291 --> 18:55.875
which, if you read your guidebooks
like someone here--

18:55.958 --> 18:57.208
You would know that it is

18:57.291 --> 19:00.083
the most important celebration
in Vietnamese culture.

19:00.166 --> 19:03.416
[Sinh] That's right. It's a time
for letting go of the past year

19:03.500 --> 19:05.625
and opening yourself up
to new possibilities.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.458
Is there like
a traditional Vietnamese toast?

19:09.541 --> 19:11.916
We usually say, "mot, hai, ba, yoo,"

19:12.000 --> 19:14.541
which is sort of like,
"One, two, three, go."

19:14.625 --> 19:20.041
[all] Mot, hai, ba, yoo!

19:20.125 --> 19:21.250
[all laughing]

19:21.333 --> 19:22.250
[Sam] Cheers.

19:23.041 --> 19:24.875
Guess what just arrived for you.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.541
Really? The suitcase, right?

19:27.625 --> 19:29.875
-We're both talking about the suitcase?
-Yeah.

19:29.958 --> 19:31.166
Thank you.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.250
Told you I knew a guy.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.291
[exhales]

19:34.125 --> 19:37.041
Mr. Saigon Silver Star
has some tricks up his sleeve.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.208
I can confirm or deny nothing.

19:46.250 --> 19:49.541
[Amanda] Then I ended up
miming a baggage carousel,

19:49.625 --> 19:51.958
which is harder to do
than you'd think by the way,

19:52.041 --> 19:54.708
before he revealed
that he speaks perfect English.

19:54.791 --> 19:58.083
You cannot stop
talking about this Sinh character.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.291
But is he yummy?

19:59.375 --> 20:02.041
Okay, we are grown women.
Why do you use words like that?

20:02.125 --> 20:03.625
[Mona] Oh, whatever.

20:03.708 --> 20:07.291
I just am excited about the prospect
of you getting back into the saddle

20:07.375 --> 20:08.458
after a big breakup.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.416
All right, fine, he's very handsome,

20:10.500 --> 20:14.083
but Sinh, his family
owns Saigon Silver Star,

20:14.166 --> 20:17.000
so he is a terrible candidate
for a vacation romance.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.416
[Mona] Oh, don't be such a prude.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.791
Anyway, fill me in.

20:19.875 --> 20:23.250
We are going on a cyclo-tour
of Ho Chi Minh City this morning.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.958
That sounds more fun than my night.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.666
I'm trying to spring
one of our clients from a Paris jail.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.541
What ding-dong shoplifts at the Louvre?

20:30.625 --> 20:31.791
[chuckles]

20:32.333 --> 20:33.166
Good luck.

20:34.958 --> 20:38.708
[gentle music playing]

20:47.500 --> 20:49.833
So, never heard the real answer.

20:49.916 --> 20:50.916
Why Vietnam?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.625
Oh, it's the number one
tourist destination.

20:54.166 --> 20:57.916
Beyond the obvious top ten list,
why Vietnam for you?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.541
-Uh…
-All right.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.500
It's gonna be you and me
stuck here together all morning.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.458
Might as well get to know each other.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.958
You know, just going through
something kind of personal,

21:09.041 --> 21:11.083
had to get out
of my regular routine, right?

21:11.875 --> 21:15.291
Traveling's good for that.
It forces us out of the comfort zone.

21:16.166 --> 21:20.166
I, uh…
Yeah, I used to travel a lot for work,

21:20.250 --> 21:22.875
but now I'm mostly chained to my desk.

21:22.958 --> 21:24.333
-[bang]
-Oh!

21:26.083 --> 21:29.125
-Uh, you okay?
-Yes. Yeah.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.416
[chuckling]

21:30.500 --> 21:32.583
Um, well, if you must know,

21:32.666 --> 21:34.958
-I've been doing my research on Tet.
-Mm.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.583
-No, no, no, no!
-No, no.

21:37.666 --> 21:38.791
Put that guidebook away.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.000
-Why?
-It's for tourists.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.916
-I'm a tourist.
-No, you're a traveler.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.166
What's the difference?

21:43.250 --> 21:47.458
A tourist wants to escape life,
a traveler wants to experience it.

21:47.541 --> 21:50.166
What's bad about occasionally
wanting to escape your life?

21:50.250 --> 21:53.416
You never know how long life's gonna be.
Why waste it on escape?

21:54.291 --> 21:56.375
Spend it on experience instead.

22:02.750 --> 22:07.166
Marketplaces like this
are the center of commerce in Vietnam.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.333
It's also the focus of community life.

22:09.416 --> 22:12.500
Now, you could buy anything here,
from local artwork,

22:12.583 --> 22:15.291
to the latest design, to fresh fish.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.708
Now, who likes to shop?

22:16.791 --> 22:18.000
Me.

22:18.083 --> 22:20.083
Trick or treat bags.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.416
Oh, yay!

22:21.500 --> 22:24.250
Here you go, here you go.

22:24.333 --> 22:28.333
I'm gonna do some major damage today.
Thanks for the dough, Mom.

22:28.416 --> 22:30.500
Wait, what?
How much money did you give her?

22:30.583 --> 22:31.916
-Thank you.
-[Dom] I don't know.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.125
How much is ten million dong?

22:34.208 --> 22:35.333
What? That's ridiculous.

22:35.416 --> 22:38.291
["Tình Mo" by Phuong Tâm playing]

22:53.791 --> 22:56.375
[indistinct chatter]

23:07.583 --> 23:08.750
Oh.

23:10.875 --> 23:11.708
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.166
All right, here we go.

23:14.291 --> 23:15.375
[Alex] It's really yummy.

23:18.291 --> 23:22.125
-Alex, what do you got there?
-Here, smell.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.250
-[coughing]
-[laugh]

23:23.333 --> 23:24.250
Delicious.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.666
It's durian. So popular in Asia.

23:26.750 --> 23:29.500
-It's famous because of its aroma.
-Mm.

23:29.583 --> 23:30.416
Mm-hmm.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.250
You can really smell it.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.750
You should see your face.
I can rewind it if you want.

23:34.833 --> 23:35.666
No, please don't.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.833
It stinks, but it tastes so good.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.000
It's tasty, for real.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.041
Try it, please.

23:41.125 --> 23:41.958
Try it.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.500
I… I'm okay.

23:44.583 --> 23:45.666
Try it.

23:46.833 --> 23:49.708
Okay. Sure. Looks…

23:52.250 --> 23:55.375
-Just pick it up? Just pick it right up.
-It's big.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.333
Okay.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.291
It's like a banana…

24:01.000 --> 24:01.875
[clears throat]

24:07.166 --> 24:10.125
I don't know how,
but it's actually really good.

24:10.208 --> 24:12.208
-Yay! Wow!
-Yay!

24:12.750 --> 24:14.000
She likes it!

24:31.875 --> 24:34.875
The Phoenix.
It's a sacred creature in Vietnam.

24:34.958 --> 24:37.666
It symbolizes regeneration
and new beginnings.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.541
-It's perfect. I'm gonna get it.
-Yeah?

24:41.125 --> 24:42.833
[in Vietnamese] How much for the scarf?

24:42.916 --> 24:44.541
-Ten dollars.
-Ten.

24:44.625 --> 24:46.958
-[in English] She says it's US $10.
-Great.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

24:51.166 --> 24:52.208
Buying a scarf.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.791
No. You gotta bargain first.

24:54.375 --> 24:55.625
We'll say five dollars.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.333
It's just a couple bucks. I can pay.

24:58.416 --> 25:00.875
It's not about the money.
She's trying to play you.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.416
First, you bargain.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.916
[in Vietnamese] Excuse me.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.208
How about five dollars?

25:05.291 --> 25:07.958
-I can't sell it for five dollars.
-[Sinh] It's only five dollars.

25:08.666 --> 25:09.541
Mm.

25:10.125 --> 25:12.833
[in English] If she doesn't accept
the price, we walk away.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.666
They always give in before we get too far.

25:16.625 --> 25:20.166
Ah, so if you really love something,

25:20.250 --> 25:24.333
give it away, and if it comes back to you
at a cheaper price, then it's fate?

25:24.416 --> 25:26.333
It's all about the walkaway.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.583
Okay, let's do it.

25:32.958 --> 25:34.250
No, thank you.

25:34.875 --> 25:37.583
[playful music]

25:44.083 --> 25:47.458
-She's not calling after us.
-[Sinh] Keep walking. Just keep walking.

25:47.541 --> 25:48.583
[Amanda] Okay.

25:55.041 --> 25:55.916
Ah--

25:57.208 --> 25:58.375
She didn't give in.

25:58.458 --> 25:59.375
Oh.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.875
Some sellers are stubborn.
Hey, it happens.

26:02.958 --> 26:04.125
Next time.

26:08.541 --> 26:10.833
Hey, I'll meet up
with you guys outside, okay?

26:10.916 --> 26:11.750
Where you going?

26:11.833 --> 26:13.000
I'm getting that scarf.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.083
Okay, see you outside.

26:37.958 --> 26:39.583
Hey! We're over here!

26:39.666 --> 26:41.416
Hi! I see that.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.375
Um…

26:42.458 --> 26:43.791
Where's the crosswalk?

26:43.875 --> 26:45.208
[Sinh] No, there's no crosswalk.

26:45.291 --> 26:48.375
Just stick your hand out
and walk nice and slow.

26:48.458 --> 26:49.750
You'll be fine, come on.

26:49.833 --> 26:50.708
Here?

26:50.791 --> 26:51.625
[Sinh] Yeah.

26:52.416 --> 26:55.666
Uh… no. I don't want to do that.

26:55.750 --> 26:57.500
-You'll be fine, come on.
-[Amanda] I--

26:57.583 --> 27:00.000
I'm fine here.
I like it here. This is good.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.625
[playful music]

27:07.208 --> 27:08.416
What-- What are--

27:11.875 --> 27:14.291
[chuckles] How did you do that?

27:14.375 --> 27:17.458
The trick to Vietnamese traffic,
always forward, never back.

27:17.541 --> 27:18.583
Mm.

27:19.166 --> 27:20.208
Come on.

27:20.291 --> 27:21.125
Let's go.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.333
Trust me.

27:29.791 --> 27:30.875
I got you.

27:41.916 --> 27:44.000
-Yay!
-Yeah!

27:44.083 --> 27:46.416
-[Sam] I knew you could do it, girl.
-Amazing.

27:47.208 --> 27:50.458
Thank you. I never could have
done that on my own, ever.

27:51.041 --> 27:52.583
Do you always sell yourself short?

27:52.666 --> 27:57.166
[scoffs] I'm not selling myself short.
I just-- I know my limitations.

27:57.250 --> 27:58.708
So don't limit yourself.

28:08.541 --> 28:10.750
Hoi An, here we come!

28:10.833 --> 28:13.416
[uplifting music playing]

28:13.500 --> 28:14.708
[phone chimes]

28:48.958 --> 28:49.791
Here you go.

28:49.875 --> 28:50.708
Thank you.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.708
Hey, um, about tomorrow.

28:53.791 --> 28:58.375
Wild guess, you have an exhaustive list
of tourist sites for me to take a look at.

28:58.458 --> 29:02.000
Uh, I wouldn't call it exhaustive,
I would call it comprehensive.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.416
-Okay.
-It's right here.

29:04.000 --> 29:04.916
You can just scroll.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.958
There's no way we'd be able to see
everything on that list.

29:08.041 --> 29:10.166
You're the one
who told me not to limit myself.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.791
I've been leading tours for a while,

29:11.875 --> 29:14.375
and there's things about travel
you may not understand.

29:15.000 --> 29:15.875
Oh, really?

29:15.958 --> 29:18.958
Vietnam, it's hot, it's crowded.
You could easily burn out.

29:19.583 --> 29:23.208
Part of the Saigon Silver Star experience
is seeing where the day takes you.

29:23.291 --> 29:25.541
Where I would love
to see the day take all of us

29:25.625 --> 29:27.625
is to a bunch of places on my list.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.000
You never do anything unexpected, huh?

29:30.958 --> 29:33.333
Be impulsive? Go with the moment?

29:33.416 --> 29:34.875
The last time I went with the moment,

29:34.958 --> 29:36.875
I grossly misread it
and someone moved to Ohio.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.458
That's oddly specific.

29:38.541 --> 29:40.916
I just would like to stick with a plan.

29:48.541 --> 29:53.166
Hey, everybody, unfortunately the temple
is closed right now.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.916
They are practicing for Tet.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.250
[group groans]

29:56.333 --> 29:57.625
Practicing what?

29:57.708 --> 29:58.833
[Anh] A lion dance.

29:58.916 --> 30:01.583
It's part of the temple's
annual Tet celebration.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.583
That's too bad. It sounds amazing.

30:03.666 --> 30:04.500
Mm.

30:05.291 --> 30:06.541
[Sinh] Hang on, guys.

30:06.625 --> 30:09.125
I may know a guy.
Let me see what I can do.

30:11.041 --> 30:14.375
[drumming]

30:32.666 --> 30:36.541
[gentle music playing]

30:49.333 --> 30:51.625
[Amanda] I'm impressed.
You really did know a guy.

30:51.708 --> 30:53.208
[Sinh] You gotta have your connections.

30:53.291 --> 30:54.166
Like this bridge.

30:54.791 --> 30:56.291
It's called Chùa Cau.

30:56.375 --> 30:58.916
Japanese traders built it
to connect with Chinese neighborhoods.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.458
It's beautiful.

31:03.416 --> 31:05.041
You're very good at your job.

31:05.125 --> 31:05.958
Wait.

31:06.791 --> 31:08.833
-Was that a compliment?
-Yes.

31:11.958 --> 31:13.166
What are you doing?

31:13.250 --> 31:14.458
Savoring the moment.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.333
My first Amanda Riley compliment.

31:17.416 --> 31:18.791
Feels nice.

31:19.541 --> 31:21.750
Okay, well, don't get used to it.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.833
Oh, so it is a rare and special thing.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.291
I'm even more honored.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.375
As you should be.

31:28.458 --> 31:29.583
[Sinh chuckles]

31:29.666 --> 31:30.500
Come on.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.708
[Amanda] That is cool.

31:34.791 --> 31:38.583
-They just leave it burning like that?
-Yeah, they just redo it over again.

31:38.666 --> 31:41.958
[gentle music continues]

31:45.125 --> 31:47.375
-I love this whole color scheme.
-Right.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.166
I think it's really gorgeous.

31:51.333 --> 31:52.250
This store is just--

31:52.333 --> 31:54.583
Hey, can I get something made for me?

31:54.666 --> 31:58.041
I'm sorry, are you actually
asking our permission for something?

31:58.125 --> 32:01.833
Well, I was actually thinking
we could get matching outfits.

32:01.916 --> 32:03.375
You know, as a family?

32:03.458 --> 32:04.291
Oh.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.958
Sounds like an amazing idea.

32:07.916 --> 32:09.916
Cool, I'm gonna look around.

32:11.458 --> 32:13.708
-Who is this child?
-I don't know.

32:19.791 --> 32:20.916
Okay, let me help you,

32:21.000 --> 32:24.083
Mr. "Same shorts and t-shirt
three days in a row."

32:24.166 --> 32:27.583
I change my t-shirt every day,
I just packed eight of the same ones.

32:28.583 --> 32:30.500
I like you in this orange.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.208
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

32:32.291 --> 32:33.458
This?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.291
Get a shirt made.

32:36.333 --> 32:38.500
Is that really my style?

32:39.375 --> 32:41.416
You do not have style. [scoffs]

32:41.500 --> 32:43.583
We're starting from scratch here, pal.

32:43.666 --> 32:44.625
Okay.

32:59.375 --> 33:00.916
[Sinh] No custom clothing for you?

33:01.541 --> 33:04.583
Oh, you know, I think I've packed plenty.

33:04.666 --> 33:05.916
What about Tet?

33:06.000 --> 33:06.875
What about it?

33:06.958 --> 33:08.833
I thought you were the guidebook expert?

33:08.916 --> 33:10.916
It's tradition to wear
new clothes for the new year.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.458
Bright colors invite luck and prosperity.

33:13.541 --> 33:15.875
Huh. In that case, where do I start?

33:15.958 --> 33:16.875
All right.

33:20.750 --> 33:21.958
That's the one.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.083
[gentle music playing]

33:24.166 --> 33:28.041
Are you sure? I mean,
that's just not what I usually wear.

33:28.125 --> 33:30.875
That's why you should wear it.
Get out of your comfort zone.

33:30.958 --> 33:32.916
He's right, for once.

33:34.958 --> 33:35.791
Stop it.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.666
[indistinct whispering]

33:51.458 --> 33:54.958
Okay, guys, let's get to the hotel
and chill before dinner.

33:55.041 --> 33:55.875
Okay.

33:57.833 --> 33:59.791
-[Sinh] We'll see you guys there, okay?
-Oh, okay.

33:59.875 --> 34:02.458
[phone vibrating]

34:02.541 --> 34:05.125
[tense music playing]

34:05.208 --> 34:06.208
We're not chilling.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.000
We're not?

34:09.083 --> 34:10.541
I got something to show you.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.625
[phone continues vibrating]

34:12.708 --> 34:13.750
Wanna get that?

34:15.916 --> 34:17.000
Uh…

34:21.958 --> 34:22.875
Not at all.

34:22.958 --> 34:24.750
[Sinh] All right. Let's go.

34:29.083 --> 34:32.416
Since we didn't get to see
all the sites on your list today,

34:32.916 --> 34:34.708
I wanted to make it up to you.

34:34.791 --> 34:38.791
By walking me down this dark,
deserted alleyway? Hmm?

34:38.875 --> 34:42.833
I thought you were a fugitive or a spy?
Where's your sense of adventure?

34:42.916 --> 34:46.333
My sense of adventure is on hold
until you tell me where we're going.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.916
That's literally the opposite
of a sense of adventure.

34:56.208 --> 34:59.750
[gentle music playing]

35:03.000 --> 35:04.125
I'm speechless.

35:05.583 --> 35:07.458
That's a first for me.

35:07.541 --> 35:08.916
I knew you'd like it.

35:13.833 --> 35:18.541
You know, this city is more than a list
of tourist attractions to be checked off.

35:19.291 --> 35:22.666
Sometimes traveling
is soaking in the atmosphere.

35:23.416 --> 35:26.500
All I can say is just wow.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.375
And hey, that's two
Amanda Riley compliments for you.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.875
"Wow" is a compliment?

35:34.125 --> 35:35.083
"Wow" as in,

35:35.166 --> 35:40.250
"Wow, I think you actually really knew
what I needed to see before I did."

35:41.208 --> 35:43.416
All right. That is a compliment.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.541
[exhales] I better pace myself.

35:47.250 --> 35:50.708
So, uh… how long have you been doing this?

35:50.791 --> 35:52.458
I mean, leading tours?

35:52.541 --> 35:54.583
Despite my expertise…

35:54.666 --> 35:55.958
[chuckles]

35:56.041 --> 35:58.916
-Five, six years. Not very long.
-What'd you do before that?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.333
Well, my mom wanted me to stay
in the US, get a suit-and-tie job.

36:02.958 --> 36:06.583
But I came back here after college,
worked at my dad's restaurant in Hue.

36:07.208 --> 36:11.375
One day, Anh called, said her dad
needed help with the tour business.

36:11.458 --> 36:14.083
I mean, I was hesitant to take the offer.

36:14.166 --> 36:16.250
Why? I mean, you're such a natural.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.375
The pressure to show visitors
the best possible version of Vietnam.

36:22.458 --> 36:25.041
I mean, I was born here,

36:25.125 --> 36:28.166
but a big part of me is American too.

36:29.625 --> 36:34.000
And it feels so amazing to share Vietnam
with the rest of the world.

36:34.791 --> 36:37.125
Once I did my first tour, I was hooked.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.416
Never turned back.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.833
Well, I'm glad.

36:44.916 --> 36:47.458
I mean, look at me.
Who knows where I'd be without you?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.791
Still waiting to buy that scarf.

36:51.875 --> 36:53.666
Why did she hate me so much?

36:53.750 --> 36:56.333
I think she sensed
a master bargainer in you.

36:56.416 --> 36:57.500
She saved herself.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.541
[Amanda] Yeah, that's it.

37:01.083 --> 37:03.166
[Sinh] There's one more thing
I want to show you.

37:17.416 --> 37:21.666
[gentle music playing]

37:21.750 --> 37:23.541
[Sinh] Now, make a wish.

37:49.708 --> 37:51.083
What did you wish for?

37:52.416 --> 37:54.916
I can't tell you, or it won't come true.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.041
[chuckles] You really believe that?

37:57.875 --> 37:59.416
-Maybe.
-[chuckles]

38:00.666 --> 38:03.250
Apparently you don't,
so tell me, what did you wish for?

38:03.875 --> 38:04.916
Top secret.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.708
See? You believe the same thing.

38:06.791 --> 38:08.250
It's good to cover my bases.

38:09.708 --> 38:11.125
Just in case.

38:28.333 --> 38:32.208
[gentle music continues]

38:51.000 --> 38:52.666
[Robin] Not like that, hold it higher.

38:53.250 --> 38:56.083
For a super camera dork,
you know nothing about taking selfies.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.958
I prefer photos of things that aren't me.

38:59.041 --> 39:01.125
Especially not photos
I'm taking of myself.

39:01.208 --> 39:04.083
That's because you don't know
how to take one. Okay, look.

39:04.166 --> 39:06.166
Put it over your head. Look up.

39:06.708 --> 39:09.208
Almost, and there, go for it.

39:09.291 --> 39:10.458
[camera shutter clicks]

39:11.750 --> 39:13.750
-Whoa!
-Oh! Yeah, that looks good. See?

39:13.833 --> 39:15.458
[Alex laughs] Thank you.

39:15.541 --> 39:18.625
Oh, that guy says he'll teach us
how to row the round boat. Come on.

39:32.625 --> 39:34.625
[sultry music playing]

39:47.416 --> 39:49.458
[Sinh] Oh, what's this?

39:50.083 --> 39:52.708
Amanda Riley… doing nothing?

39:54.041 --> 39:56.833
Doing nothing feels, uh, very weird.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.500
-Keep practicing. You'll get better at it.
-Right.

39:59.583 --> 40:01.791
[Alex] Hey! We're in the boat!

40:01.875 --> 40:02.708
Woo!

40:02.791 --> 40:06.250
-It's kind of scary!
-It's not scary. Don't be a baby.

40:06.333 --> 40:07.166
[chuckles]

40:07.250 --> 40:09.083
-They look like they're having fun.
-[Sinh] Yes.

40:10.041 --> 40:10.916
Let's go.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.916
In… In the saucer?

40:15.000 --> 40:15.833
[Sinh] Mm-hmm.

40:21.208 --> 40:23.250
So, when was the last time you did this?

40:23.333 --> 40:24.708
-Never.
-Never?

40:24.791 --> 40:25.916
[Sinh chuckles]

40:26.000 --> 40:27.583
That's why I wanted to try.

40:29.791 --> 40:32.666
Okay, in that case,
may I offer up a suggestion?

40:32.750 --> 40:34.666
I think just try to--
Just try wiggling it.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.041
-Wiggle?
-Like a rudder.

40:36.125 --> 40:37.791
-All right, you wanna try?
-Yeah.

40:41.666 --> 40:44.000
-Wiggle, wiggle. No.
-You don't do that.

40:44.083 --> 40:46.416
What I'm gonna do is more of a--

40:46.500 --> 40:48.666
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

40:52.291 --> 40:54.416
Okay, we are truly getting nowhere.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.500
[Sinh laughs]

40:55.583 --> 40:58.166
And don't say something
deep and metaphorical about that.

40:58.250 --> 41:01.625
Nope. Never. You're just bad at paddling.

41:01.708 --> 41:02.750
Hey, here. Let me try.

41:02.833 --> 41:05.041
-No, I've got-- I said I've got it.
-No, let me.

41:06.166 --> 41:07.125
[Amanda yelps]

41:07.916 --> 41:10.541
[Sinh] Woo-hoo!

41:10.625 --> 41:12.041
-I can't swim!
-[Sinh laughs]

41:12.125 --> 41:13.500
-I got you.
-Just kidding!

41:39.708 --> 41:40.541
[Anh] Hey, guys!

41:40.625 --> 41:44.833
Sinh, bad news. There's a three-hour wait
for the Golden Hand Bridge tickets.

41:44.916 --> 41:46.166
[group groans]

41:46.791 --> 41:47.916
Three hours?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.500
You don't know a guy for that?

41:54.125 --> 41:55.208
Hang on.

41:55.291 --> 41:57.166
Hey, guys, new destination.

41:58.041 --> 42:00.125
One even better
than the Golden Hand Bridge.

42:00.208 --> 42:02.291
Better than the Golden Hand Bridge?

42:02.875 --> 42:03.833
Yeah, way better.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.458
[girls] Okay.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.833
Yeah, where are we?

42:13.916 --> 42:16.458
-Has anyone ever told you you're im--
-Impatient?

42:16.541 --> 42:19.291
Yeah, my boss says
that's why she hired me.

42:20.375 --> 42:22.500
Welcome to My Son Sanctuary.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.833
[poignant music playing]

42:28.916 --> 42:29.916
Wow.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.666
These are ancient Hindu temples

42:44.750 --> 42:48.625
built over the course of a thousand years
by the ancestors of the Cham people.

42:48.708 --> 42:52.166
The Champa Empire
ruled parts of Vietnam for many centuries.

42:52.250 --> 42:55.750
Their kings built these temples
to worship the deity Shiva.

42:56.375 --> 42:57.750
Feel free to explore, guys.

43:00.250 --> 43:03.166
[reflective music playing]

43:39.750 --> 43:40.833
It's a wonder, right?

43:42.333 --> 43:43.958
I mean, how did they build this?

43:44.583 --> 43:47.208
There are many theories,
but no one knows for sure.

43:47.291 --> 43:48.541
Embrace the mystery,

43:49.625 --> 43:51.250
being a woman of mystery yourself.

43:54.208 --> 43:57.041
So, My Son isn't on the usual tour?

43:57.125 --> 43:57.958
[Sinh] No.

43:58.041 --> 44:01.333
Everyone wants to go and see
the Golden Hand Bridge, which is awesome,

44:01.958 --> 44:04.458
but this place, it's something else.

44:06.875 --> 44:09.125
[gentle music playing]

44:09.208 --> 44:10.125
I can feel it.

44:14.291 --> 44:17.041
It's kind of like I'm…

44:17.791 --> 44:21.625
transported to another time
and place, you know? It's--

44:21.708 --> 44:24.416
It's not just another tourist site, it's…

44:25.625 --> 44:27.125
it's an experience.

44:29.291 --> 44:30.416
Agreed.

44:33.208 --> 44:36.541
I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I want more of this.

44:37.083 --> 44:39.333
I want experience.
I don't want something in my guidebook.

44:39.416 --> 44:41.500
I want off the beaten path.

44:42.125 --> 44:44.875
Is Amanda Riley being… impulsive?

44:46.375 --> 44:47.208
Let's see.

44:49.750 --> 44:50.583
Shall we?

44:57.541 --> 44:59.625
-Morning, fellow travelers.
-Hi.

44:59.708 --> 45:02.500
-Guess what? Change of itinerary.
-Ooh, where to?

45:02.583 --> 45:05.083
We're taking
an off-the-beaten-path detour.

to visit and watch The Bachelor with her.

not listening to this voicemail,

49:11.416 --> 49:13.375
but just in case you are,

49:13.458 --> 49:16.291
I just want to let you know
that I get it. I'm an idiot.

Hey.

Good, good.

49:25.041 --> 49:26.541
So… [clears throat]

49:27.750 --> 49:30.833
…when you said detour,
you were not messing around.

-It's worth it though, right?
-Oh, absolutely.

49:33.583 --> 49:37.666
I mean, it's everything I ever imagined
the Vietnamese countryside could be.

has changed since I was kid.

But a lot of the old ways
stayed the same, though.

49:51.291 --> 49:54.041
I know some Americans
think of Vietnam only in terms of war,

49:54.125 --> 49:56.375
but it's just
a small piece of our history.

49:57.333 --> 49:58.291
Definitely.

50:00.125 --> 50:02.916
So, um, how long will we be here?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.708
Until Têt, which is two days away.

50:04.791 --> 50:07.750
It's tradition to head back
to your village for the new year.

50:07.833 --> 50:11.833
Ah. Well, I know your grandmother's
thrilled to have you and Anh visit.

50:13.375 --> 50:15.750
Anh, yes. Me?

50:15.833 --> 50:17.916
And she'll keep me guessing as punishment.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.125
[both laugh]

50:19.208 --> 50:20.916
Bà Noi is a tough cookie.

50:22.666 --> 50:26.208
-You're afraid of her, aren't you?
-Yes, 100%.

50:26.291 --> 50:27.625
She's all bark, no bite.

50:27.708 --> 50:29.708
Yeah, but her bark is pretty scary.

50:29.791 --> 50:32.333
What? Does Amanda Riley
need me to protect her?

50:33.041 --> 50:36.958
Really? Protect me from Bà Noi?
You think you got what it takes?

50:37.875 --> 50:39.833
Truthfully, no. [laughs]

50:42.541 --> 50:46.791
Sinh! I'm not cleaning up by myself.
Come help. Now!

50:46.875 --> 50:48.708
Ah, so close to sweet freedom.

50:50.250 --> 50:51.958
-Sorry.
-Goodnight, Amanda.

50:52.708 --> 50:53.750
Goodnight, Sinh.

1:09:31.666 --> 1:09:33.625
-Awesome.
-[Sinh] We're also gonna be picking up

1:09:33.708 --> 1:09:35.625
a new tour guest at the hotel.

1:09:35.708 --> 1:09:36.666
More friends.

1:09:42.041 --> 1:09:44.958
[gentle music playing]

1:10:06.333 --> 1:10:07.291
[Amanda] No, go ahead.

1:10:07.375 --> 1:10:09.750
-Fancy camera and everything?
-Yeah, I got you, girl.

1:10:09.833 --> 1:10:11.125
Alright, see you soon, babe.

1:10:15.625 --> 1:10:16.458
What?

1:10:16.958 --> 1:10:18.375
[phone vibrating]

1:10:20.166 --> 1:10:21.500
[exhales]

1:10:29.458 --> 1:10:30.625
Definitely.

1:10:37.333 --> 1:10:38.166
[John] Hey!

1:10:40.458 --> 1:10:41.416
Surprise!

1:10:41.958 --> 1:10:42.958
[John chuckles]

1:10:43.041 --> 1:10:44.083
Hey.

1:10:44.166 --> 1:10:45.791
So you know Amanda?

1:10:45.875 --> 1:10:47.250
Uh, I do.

1:10:47.333 --> 1:10:50.375
Hey, well, any friend of Amanda's
is a friend of ours.

1:10:50.458 --> 1:10:51.291
[John] Thank you.

1:10:51.375 --> 1:10:53.250
Technically, I'm not a friend.

1:10:53.333 --> 1:10:54.791
I'm, uh…

1:10:54.875 --> 1:10:56.250
I'm her boyfriend.

1:10:58.083 --> 1:11:02.041
Ex-boyfriend. We… we broke up.

1:11:02.125 --> 1:11:06.416
Yes, yes, we did. We broke up,
which is actually why I am here.

1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:08.875
[chuckles] To… to win you back.

1:11:10.625 --> 1:11:13.916
[bittersweet music playing]

1:11:25.375 --> 1:11:28.166
So, uh, h-how did you find me?

1:11:28.750 --> 1:11:30.000
Just followed my heart.

1:11:30.791 --> 1:11:31.625
No, really.

1:11:34.125 --> 1:11:35.958
I just called the tour company.

1:11:36.041 --> 1:11:37.125
[chuckles]

1:11:37.208 --> 1:11:41.333
Fifty thousand rewards points later,
I had a plane ticket and a bus seat.

1:11:41.416 --> 1:11:42.625
I'm a forensic accountant,

1:11:42.708 --> 1:11:45.625
so we're sort of like
the "James Bonds" of finance.

1:11:45.708 --> 1:11:48.208
Right. Well, speaking of James Bond,

1:11:48.291 --> 1:11:51.125
I am doing an undercover shop
of the tour company,

1:11:51.208 --> 1:11:54.333
so do not mention
to any of the others why I'm here.

1:11:54.416 --> 1:11:57.041
Oh, yeah, no, of course. It's so hot.

1:11:57.125 --> 1:11:59.208
I can't believe soup is so popular.

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.375
And what's up with that boho hotel?
It's not the usual Tourista vibe.

1:12:03.458 --> 1:12:05.375
It's cozy, and it's personal.

1:12:05.458 --> 1:12:07.666
I like it.
Maybe it's the new Tourista vibe.

1:12:07.750 --> 1:12:08.833
So, uh…

1:12:09.625 --> 1:12:10.958
So, listen, there's…

1:12:12.666 --> 1:12:14.916
There's obviously
an elephant in the room here,

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:19.333
and I have spent way too much time
ignoring that elephant.

1:12:19.833 --> 1:12:22.000
Wait, am-- Am I the elephant?

1:12:22.083 --> 1:12:24.541
No, you're-- No.

1:12:25.166 --> 1:12:27.541
The, um-- The elephant, it's…

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.041
You know, I--
Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.

1:12:32.125 --> 1:12:35.708
I only just got here and I'm sure
you're probably still upset with me.

1:12:35.791 --> 1:12:37.166
That's a good guess.

1:12:37.250 --> 1:12:38.500
I just want you to know

1:12:38.583 --> 1:12:42.583
that I have been doing
a lot of thinking about, you know, uh,

1:12:43.375 --> 1:12:47.416
riding off into the sunset with you, so…

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:49.916
On our huge pet elephant, of course.

1:12:50.791 --> 1:12:52.000
[chuckles]

1:12:52.083 --> 1:12:54.625
Just-- Just… think about it, okay?

1:12:58.041 --> 1:12:59.708
-John is what?
-[Amanda] Here.

1:12:59.791 --> 1:13:02.041
As in like, here-here.

1:13:02.125 --> 1:13:06.625
[gasps] This is all such
a super swoon-worthy moment.

1:13:06.708 --> 1:13:08.333
I guess it is kind of romantic.

1:13:08.416 --> 1:13:09.541
You guess?

1:13:09.625 --> 1:13:12.541
That's not
the heart-fluttering answer I expected.

1:13:12.625 --> 1:13:14.000
Yes, because…

1:13:15.291 --> 1:13:17.500
because I met someone else. Sinh.

1:13:17.583 --> 1:13:19.458
Ah! This story finally got good.

1:13:19.541 --> 1:13:22.041
Not that it was boring before,
but it was, you know,

1:13:22.125 --> 1:13:25.333
your average, "My friend got dumped
and went on a vacation" story.

1:13:25.416 --> 1:13:30.166
But now it's you and two hot men
in a love triangle, and it's in Vietnam.

1:13:30.250 --> 1:13:32.791
Okay, I feel like you're getting
slightly carried away.

1:13:32.875 --> 1:13:35.125
It's just a way more fun story to tell.

1:13:35.208 --> 1:13:37.958
Not that I'm telling anyone.
At least anyone that you know.

1:13:38.041 --> 1:13:39.083
What are you gonna do?

1:13:39.166 --> 1:13:41.458
I'm-- I don't know.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.250
I mean, Sinh is just--
He's so adventurous and exciting.

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:48.208
But John and I
are just so comfortable together.

1:13:48.291 --> 1:13:50.791
-Boring.
-And Sinh lives in Vietnam,

1:13:50.875 --> 1:13:54.666
John lives in Ohio,
which is, I guess, still the same country.

1:13:54.750 --> 1:13:56.291
-Is it?
-John and I were together

1:13:56.375 --> 1:13:57.750
for such a long time,

1:13:57.833 --> 1:14:00.458
and what if Sinh's
just a vacation romance, you know?

1:14:00.541 --> 1:14:02.166
Not a real-life one.

1:14:02.250 --> 1:14:05.000
Let alone what he might think
when he finds out what I'm doing here.

1:14:05.083 --> 1:14:09.166
Speaking of, I submitted our proposal
for Saigon Silver Star Tours.

1:14:09.250 --> 1:14:13.750
Okay, wait, so is that why
you're in the office at 2:00 a.m.?

1:14:13.833 --> 1:14:17.958
My God, yes, you know that I live here.
The security guard calls me Mom.

1:14:18.041 --> 1:14:19.250
Okay, "Mom."

1:14:19.333 --> 1:14:22.291
Tell me when the Saigon Silver Star deal
goes through, okay?

1:14:22.375 --> 1:14:24.166
We are the right company for them.

1:14:24.250 --> 1:14:26.583
If it goes through, will do.

1:14:26.666 --> 1:14:27.541
Right.

1:14:28.125 --> 1:14:30.625
Good luck out there.
I'll talk to you soon.

1:14:30.708 --> 1:14:31.833
[exhales]

1:14:39.750 --> 1:14:44.583
Water puppetry has a long history
in Vietnam, going back centuries.

1:14:44.666 --> 1:14:46.333
When rice fields would flood,

1:14:46.416 --> 1:14:49.541
the villagers would put on puppet shows
to entertain themselves.

1:14:49.625 --> 1:14:52.333
Oh! Sinh, right?

1:14:52.416 --> 1:14:55.250
Yeah, you guys know so much about Vietnam.

1:14:55.333 --> 1:14:58.000
I know nothing about Los Angeles.

1:14:58.083 --> 1:14:59.250
It's literally our job.

1:14:59.875 --> 1:15:01.000
What's your line of work?

1:15:01.083 --> 1:15:02.208
Ah, uh…

1:15:02.291 --> 1:15:05.208
Forensic accounting. It's, uh--
It's complicated.

1:15:05.291 --> 1:15:08.083
You use accounting
to investigate fraud and embezzlement,

1:15:08.166 --> 1:15:11.500
and to analyze financial information
for use in legal proceedings.

1:15:11.583 --> 1:15:13.958
See? So not that complicated after all.

1:15:14.041 --> 1:15:15.041
Okay, let's go.

1:15:15.125 --> 1:15:16.250
Okay.

1:15:16.333 --> 1:15:17.541
Thank you, Sinh.

1:15:20.458 --> 1:15:21.291
Hey.

1:15:22.625 --> 1:15:24.833
I just want to explain about John.

1:15:24.916 --> 1:15:26.541
You owe me no explanation.

1:15:26.625 --> 1:15:28.000
We kissed, so I do.

1:15:29.416 --> 1:15:30.250
We did kiss.

1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.375
It meant something to me.

1:15:33.458 --> 1:15:34.708
To me too.

1:15:34.791 --> 1:15:37.416
So you can imagine why I'm a little
thrown by the arrival of your ex.

1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:38.875
That makes two of us.

1:15:38.958 --> 1:15:40.958
[sighs]

1:15:43.125 --> 1:15:44.416
The show's starting.

1:15:45.166 --> 1:15:46.083
Let's go sit.

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.791
[traditional music playing]

1:15:57.333 --> 1:15:59.041
[chuckling]

1:16:11.708 --> 1:16:14.291
[audience applauds]

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.500
[traditional music continues]

1:16:50.041 --> 1:16:53.458
[audience applauds and cheers]

1:17:01.208 --> 1:17:03.625
[Maya] I loved the fire and the dragons.

1:17:03.708 --> 1:17:05.541
I don't know how they do that!

1:17:05.625 --> 1:17:07.291
Those puppeteers were brilliant!

1:17:07.375 --> 1:17:11.541
Oh, it was so beautiful,
and the music was wonderful, wasn't it?

1:17:11.625 --> 1:17:13.416
-Yes!
-Baby, have you tried this?

1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:15.708
Oh my God. That is amazing.

1:17:15.791 --> 1:17:18.500
-Oh, okay, that looks good.
-Oh, it's good.

1:17:18.583 --> 1:17:21.125
…eating like this when I already do feel…

1:17:22.541 --> 1:17:24.291
I'm not gonna puke or anything.

1:17:24.916 --> 1:17:25.750
Okay.

1:17:26.333 --> 1:17:27.750
[Alex] Oh, it's been amazing--

1:17:27.833 --> 1:17:29.125
Sinh.

1:17:29.208 --> 1:17:30.583
Sinh?

1:17:30.666 --> 1:17:32.791
My dad sold the tour company.

1:17:32.875 --> 1:17:34.791
Your dad sold Saigon Silver Star?

1:17:36.291 --> 1:17:37.500
To who?

1:17:37.583 --> 1:17:41.083
An American company called Tourista?

1:17:41.166 --> 1:17:42.291
Ah--!

1:17:42.375 --> 1:17:45.333
Amanda, why didn't you tell me?

1:17:46.041 --> 1:17:47.125
Why would she know?

1:17:50.416 --> 1:17:51.250
Uh…

1:17:51.333 --> 1:17:52.875
-I'm sorry. No, I'm--
-I'm…

1:17:54.333 --> 1:17:56.666
[Amanda] Uh… [clears throat]

1:17:56.750 --> 1:17:58.083
I'm a…

1:17:59.375 --> 1:18:01.750
I'm a travel executive with Tourista,

1:18:01.833 --> 1:18:04.125
and it is not what it looks like.

1:18:04.208 --> 1:18:06.208
I mean, it is, but it's not,

1:18:06.291 --> 1:18:08.666
and also, I can explain, all right? So…

1:18:09.875 --> 1:18:11.541
Sinh? Sinh.

1:18:12.750 --> 1:18:15.000
Sinh! Sinh!

1:18:16.500 --> 1:18:18.458
So this was all just business?

1:18:18.541 --> 1:18:20.291
Sure, it started that way,

1:18:20.375 --> 1:18:23.291
it did, but I had the trip of a lifetime.

1:18:23.375 --> 1:18:25.791
And all I want
is for other people to experience that.

1:18:25.875 --> 1:18:28.666
Why would I believe
anything you say now? Huh?

1:18:30.416 --> 1:18:33.750
-I feel like such an idiot.
-No, no, I am the idiot. I am the idiot.

1:18:33.833 --> 1:18:35.666
I wanted to come clean and tell you,

1:18:35.750 --> 1:18:38.250
-but I didn't know if it was gonna happen.
-Stop.

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:39.833
Just stop.

1:18:42.833 --> 1:18:44.250
What does it matter now?

1:18:48.666 --> 1:18:49.666
[gasps]

1:18:51.958 --> 1:18:56.041
[bittersweet music playing]

1:18:57.750 --> 1:19:00.500
[John] I mean,
aside from the Tourista drama,

1:19:00.583 --> 1:19:02.291
last night was so much fun.

1:19:02.375 --> 1:19:06.166
You know, the puppets and the crazy food
on the tiny little chairs.

1:19:06.250 --> 1:19:09.875
Everything's so authentic
and adorable here.

1:19:10.416 --> 1:19:13.583
But the best part was being here with you,

1:19:14.666 --> 1:19:17.708
which is lucky for me

1:19:18.250 --> 1:19:21.250
because Reed only needs me
'til the end of the year.

1:19:22.041 --> 1:19:25.333
So, we just do long-distance 'til then,

1:19:25.416 --> 1:19:26.625
I'm back in LA,

1:19:26.708 --> 1:19:31.708
and we can start… looking for houses

1:19:31.791 --> 1:19:33.916
like you, uh… like you keep wanting to.

1:19:34.833 --> 1:19:35.958
House hunting?

1:19:36.583 --> 1:19:39.875
I think that's quite a turnaround,
because two weeks ago,

1:19:39.958 --> 1:19:42.833
-you were excited to be on a hiatus.
-[scoffs]

1:19:43.833 --> 1:19:44.666
Yeah, no, I--

1:19:44.750 --> 1:19:48.208
Look-- I mean,
I would pay a fortune to take that back.

1:19:48.291 --> 1:19:51.500
But you can't and you shouldn't because

1:19:52.416 --> 1:19:53.791
we are where we are.

1:19:53.875 --> 1:19:54.833
Exactly.

1:19:54.916 --> 1:19:55.833
Here.

1:19:56.708 --> 1:20:01.166
It's funny, I think I was so horrified
by the idea of marriage

1:20:01.250 --> 1:20:06.083
that I ran all the way to Ohio
just to avoid it, but then I realized,

1:20:06.166 --> 1:20:09.458
if it's that important to you,
I should be willing to make the sacrifice.

1:20:09.541 --> 1:20:11.916
But it shouldn't be a sacrifice, John.

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:15.541
Look, if you wanted to be with me,
it wouldn't even feel like a compromise.

1:20:15.625 --> 1:20:18.833
Hell, if you wanted to be with me,
you would have asked me to move to Ohio.

1:20:23.625 --> 1:20:24.625
Look.

1:20:26.166 --> 1:20:28.000
When you left, I was lost.

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.958
I was so comfortable
in our little corner of the world

1:20:32.041 --> 1:20:34.375
that I never bothered
to look around outside of it.

1:20:36.458 --> 1:20:40.958
And as deeply corny as it sounds,
this trip has shown me that

1:20:42.208 --> 1:20:44.125
I wasn't actually lost, I just…

1:20:45.541 --> 1:20:47.625
I just wasn't where I was supposed to be.

1:20:49.416 --> 1:20:50.666
[exhales]

1:20:52.833 --> 1:20:53.833
It's, uh…

1:20:56.125 --> 1:20:59.708
This feels like
it could have been an email.

1:20:59.791 --> 1:21:01.041
[Amanda chuckles]

1:21:02.916 --> 1:21:05.000
Possibly, yeah, but, uh…

1:21:06.458 --> 1:21:10.125
[sighs] You know, I'm…
I'm so glad you're here.

1:21:10.208 --> 1:21:11.708
I really am, truly,

1:21:11.791 --> 1:21:15.875
