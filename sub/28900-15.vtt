You guys, I'm not doing
the Fri‐yay dance.

No. This is the Fri‐yay dance.

00:28.487 --> 00:31.698
I'm doing the
"your mom and I just booked

00:31.698 --> 00:33.408

Not to quibble, but,
very similar.

Yeah, Nia, just think
about how much fun

when Dad gets here.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
calm down.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.717
Just because Chelsea
and I are gone

00:50.717 --> 00:52.511
doesn't mean
you can get away
with any funny biz.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.055
Uh, but funny biz is my biz.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.433

on Dad Weekend.

first official Dad Weekend

Prison?

So, where are you guys
going on your Friend‐iversary
trip this year?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.491
Bungee jumping?
Extreme karaoke?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.118
Close. The spa.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.162
But, uh, don't your
Friend‐iversary trips

01:19.162 --> 01:20.956

01:20.956 --> 01:22.291
I'll tell you right now,

I'm not pulling out
any more porcupine quills.

any scars, but I do.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.383
Well, you won't have
to do that, okay?

01:31.383 --> 01:32.926
Because this year
we're breaking the curse.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.096
We're going to a luxury spa.
All chill, no quill.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.141
The closest thing I've had
to a spa treatment lately

01:39.141 --> 01:41.351
is standing in front of
the dishwasher and lettin'

01:41.351 --> 01:43.061

01:45.230 --> 01:47.149
Is that why you always
ask to do the dishes?

01:47.149 --> 01:49.901
Well, that, and the dish soap
makes my hands so baby soft.

We video‐chat every day,

03:20.951 --> 03:22.994
and he always sends me
the best gifts.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.790
Not just you.
He sent me this trophy.

That's a goblet.
You're supposed to
drink out of it.

Oh, good. 'Cause I've been
drinking out of it anyway.

that‐that must be nice.

Why do you say that?

Well...

Me and my dad are open
and honest about everything.

Except, um...

03:51.022 --> 03:52.899
I haven't told him
about my visions.

Right, and this is
one more thing

19:24.413 --> 19:25.706
And the future.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.166
That is a deal, mate.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.294
(grunts) Oh.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.382
‐Ha!
‐Are you okay there, Dad?

19:34.382 --> 19:36.050
Oh, jigging's
a young man's game.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.721
Tess, we looked everywhere
for the earring.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.722
It's gone.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.015
Okay, I might as well
take responsibility,

19:43.015 --> 19:44.475
pack my bags
and move in with Dad.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.396
Hey, I think I found
one of your mom's earrings
on the roof.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.148
What? Dad, thank you so much!

19:51.148 --> 19:52.233
Where'd you even
find this thing?

19:52.233 --> 19:54.610
The same place I found it
when I gave it to your mom.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.071
On the ground
next to a go kart.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.283
Really? Mom said that
these were priceless.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.868
She did?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.829
Yeah, I still got it.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.331
I gotta talk
to your brother,

20:07.331 --> 20:09.041
but I wanna hear
more about this.

20:10.793 --> 20:14.505
Wait, so you rebelled,
everything went wrong,

20:14.505 --> 20:17.633
you got caught,
and your dad's happy about it?

20:18.676 --> 20:20.177
Teach me your ways!

20:22.513 --> 20:23.514
(knock on door)

20:26.851 --> 20:29.019
Booker, we need to talk about
what happened up there.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.190
I'm sorry. I know
I ruined our weekend.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.276
Stop saying that.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.737
And stop apologizing
for who you are.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.697
Wait, so...

20:39.697 --> 20:41.991
you're‐you're not mad at me

20:41.991 --> 20:46.954
or disappointed in me
for being... different?

20:46.954 --> 20:49.081
Of course I'm not.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.168
You're my son.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.420
And I love you
no matter what.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.506
Why didn't you tell me?

20:57.506 --> 21:01.260
I wanted to, but it was
never the right time.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.054
Then, it kind of became
normal to keep it a secret.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.974
Yeah, I guess a part of me
did always wonder,

21:06.974 --> 21:09.185
you know,
with your mom and all.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.353
Ah, man, I always thought
that it would be Nia.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.105
You can't get
anything past that kid.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.982
‐She is so smart.
‐Yeah, that‐‐ that...

21:16.734 --> 21:18.903
Not the time.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.489
Well, now that everything's
out in the open...

21:21.489 --> 21:24.116
what did you think about
Mom's visions anyway?

21:24.116 --> 21:27.161
Well, if I'm being honest‐‐

21:27.161 --> 21:28.496
Whoa, did you feel that?

21:28.496 --> 21:30.581
(sniffing)
No, but I smell it.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.959
Devon/Booker:
Seaweed?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.628
Yes, it's seaweed.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.964
Ah, the Friend‐iversary curse?

21:38.964 --> 21:42.009
Yes. Now what were you saying
about me before I came in here?

21:42.009 --> 21:44.053
Booker was telling me
that he has visions.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.723
Really?
You told him?

21:47.723 --> 21:50.017
I felt like it was something
you could have told me, Rae.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.645
No, no. That is
Booker's story to tell.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.731
Yeah and, uh,
I've been agonizing over it.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.317
Well, I know first‐hand
how hard that can be.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.194
Remember how long
it took me to tell you?

22:00.194 --> 22:03.572
Yeah, you had that vision
that I proposed to you
at Captain Flounders,

22:03.572 --> 22:06.283
and you said,
"If the restaurant
has two stars,

22:06.283 --> 22:08.369
then the ring better
have 10 karats."

22:10.079 --> 22:13.165
And that was the start
of you not listening to me.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.625
You should have just
listened to‐‐

22:14.625 --> 22:17.711
Anyway, I'm glad I told you.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.175
Me, too.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.469
Me three.
Come here.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.430
I'm so proud of you.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.475
Now no one
in this family has
any secrets, yeah?
