Hey!

[groaning]

02:00.450 --> 02:02.919
Hey.
Hey.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.046
Thanks for coming.

02:04.050 --> 02:05.586
Kind of freaked me
out on the phone.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.684
What's going on?

02:09.020 --> 02:11.250
We have to talk.

02:12.060 --> 02:14.552
Ok. You know how much
you care about you.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.096
Ok. Just whatever it is,
just tell me, ok?

02:16.100 --> 02:18.467
I went by your
restaurant last night,

02:18.470 --> 02:20.564
And I saw you
with brody.

02:20.570 --> 02:24.393
Why didn't you come in? I
would have introduced you to him.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.868
I've already met him,
tracy.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.279
His real name is
perry whitley.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.671
He's a second-year
art major at alcott university.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.808
The university called me
into assess a threat,

02:33.820 --> 02:35.549
And I made contact
with him,

02:35.550 --> 02:39.885
And he became fixated
on me.

02:39.890 --> 02:44.521
I know. It's a lot
to process.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.488
You think he
sought me out

02:47.500 --> 02:49.525
To get close to you?

02:49.530 --> 02:51.897
Stalkers invade the world
of the people they stalk

02:51.900 --> 02:53.720
To feel closer
to them,

02:53.740 --> 02:56.232
To feed their obsession.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.629
We've seen this
before.

03:02.180 --> 03:05.502
I found these
on his dorm room wall.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.273
He's escalating,
tracy.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.315
He's dangerous.

03:16.020 --> 03:17.886
What is wrong
with me?

03:17.890 --> 03:19.153
Nothing is wrong
with you.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.980
This has nothing
to do with your past.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.355
You're a strong woman
who was lied to.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.326
That is it.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.889
He asked me
about you.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.894
He got your alarm code
from my phone, didn't he?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.059
I believe so.

03:31.070 --> 03:34.165
And he was the one that
left the teddy bear.

03:34.180 --> 03:37.502
So he knows
about your family,

03:37.510 --> 03:38.739
Your real name.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.105
I never said anything,
I swear.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.373
I know. He found out
some other way.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.744
You know how insidious
this gets.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.741
There's no room
for apology, trace.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.388
There's only room
for the correct response

03:49.390 --> 03:51.620
Because as survivors
as stalking we know

03:51.630 --> 03:55.089
That our reaction
is everything.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.558
I need you to make
minimal contact

03:57.570 --> 04:00.494
And not tip him off.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.561
Do you understand?

04:03.570 --> 04:06.631
I'm sorry.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.472
God.

04:13.450 --> 04:15.270
Jack: A woman
did all this?

04:15.280 --> 04:16.918
She knew how to fight.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.319
Martial arts, judo?

04:18.320 --> 04:21.380
I don't know. Some kind
of karate chop mess.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.312
She surprised me.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.856
I thought she was
gonna kill me,

04:23.860 --> 04:26.022
If that guard hadn't
have come when he did--

04:26.030 --> 04:27.555
How long has she
been stalking you?

04:27.560 --> 04:28.789
About two months?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.552
Why didn't you
report it?

04:30.570 --> 04:31.765
I was too embarrassed.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.522
Told some of the guys
at work.

04:33.540 --> 04:37.636
Said I should be flattered
like I can't get a woman.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.438
You told the responding
officer that you

04:39.440 --> 04:40.635
Couldn't see her face.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.108
Yeah. She was
wearing a hat.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.875
In your report, you said
that a female passenger's

04:44.880 --> 04:46.302
Been stalking you.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.549
Tell me about her.

04:47.550 --> 04:49.518
Her name is nora.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.409
Um, I don't have
a last name.

04:51.420 --> 04:52.888
She rides every day,

04:52.890 --> 04:55.359
Gets off
at 3rd and wilcox.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.385
Works at a dry cleaners
nearby.

04:57.390 --> 05:01.759
She's...Been hot
for me for a while.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.229
Explain
what you mean.

05:04.230 --> 05:05.868
What? A woman can't
be hot for me?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.793
Look. I know I'm
just a bus driver--

05:07.800 --> 05:10.531
That's not
what I mean, sir.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.009
Describe her
behavior towards you.

05:13.010 --> 05:15.775
She always sits
in the first 3 rows,

05:15.780 --> 05:17.373
Makes eyes at me
in the mirror,

05:17.380 --> 05:18.973
And that's how
it started.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.379
Then one day,
she got on the bus,

05:20.380 --> 05:23.543
And right at the front,
she dropped her purse,

05:23.550 --> 05:26.019
And when she went
to pick it up,

05:26.020 --> 05:29.012
She touched me.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.385
Touched you how?

05:30.390 --> 05:34.281
She...Fondled me.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.256
How?

05:35.260 --> 05:37.194
Do you really want me
to say it?

05:37.200 --> 05:39.328
She grabbed my junk.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.694
On a crowded bus?

05:40.700 --> 05:42.532
It was a third full.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.167
Anyway, she rode
the bus all day long.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.638
She never got off,
and finally, I said,

05:45.640 --> 05:48.974
"ma'am, this bus is
done of for the night."”

05:48.980 --> 05:53.804
And she rode with me
back to the bus yard,

05:53.820 --> 05:55.970
And we did it.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.050
In the bus?

05:57.050 --> 06:01.385
Yeah. Just hot sex.

06:01.390 --> 06:02.710
Just the one time?

06:02.730 --> 06:04.516
Yeah. It was
just sex,

06:04.530 --> 06:06.885
And then she asked
for my number,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.959
And I gave her a fake one,
which was stupid

06:08.960 --> 06:11.725
Because she called it
and got mad.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.562
She knew I was
blowing her off.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.561
Why did you
blow her off?

06:15.570 --> 06:16.890
She was mean.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.139
Mean how?

06:18.140 --> 06:21.974
The sex was
way too rough for me.

06:21.980 --> 06:22.936
I like it tender.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.306
She kept slapping me,
pinching me.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.173
It hurt.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.774
So you think nora
knew martial arts?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.815
Yeah. It had to be her.

06:31.820 --> 06:35.313
Same weight,
same size.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.879
She tried to hide
her face,

06:36.890 --> 06:39.120
But it was nora.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.451
Sounds like nora's
a rejected stalker--

06:41.460 --> 06:42.791
Angry, aggressive.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.325
Likes to have sex
on a bus.

06:44.330 --> 06:46.264
You've never had
sex on a bus?

06:46.270 --> 06:48.967
Ben: One dry cleaner
near 3rd and wilcox.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.335
I called and asked
for nora.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.160
She is working today.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.763
Field trip?
Let's do it.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.636

a late night.

07:06.050 --> 07:06.812
Morning.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.254
You and jack
on the bus driver?

07:08.260 --> 07:10.115
Yeah. We're just
heading out now.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.327
Ok. I'll have ben
update me.

07:13.330 --> 07:14.957
Everything ok?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.189
Yeah. Why?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.998
You're late.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.490
So?

07:19.500 --> 07:22.197
You're never late.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.534
I'm fine.
Thanks, janice.

We need to speak to you
about henry white.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.590
The bus driver?

08:28.600 --> 08:31.035
He was attacked last night,
got beaten up

08:31.040 --> 08:32.201
Pretty badly.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.200
Big guero like that

08:33.210 --> 08:35.633
Should be able to
handle himself in a fight.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.678
What happened
to your hand?

08:38.679 --> 08:40.546
I burnt it
on a steam iron.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.039
I do it all the time.
So?

08:42.049 --> 08:43.745
Where were you
last night?

08:43.750 --> 08:46.481
Wait. Are you accusing
me of something?

08:46.490 --> 08:48.015
No. Henry is.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.488
He thinks that
you attacked him

08:49.490 --> 08:51.310
Because he rejected you.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.422
That fatass.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.228
Where were you
last night?

08:54.230 --> 08:55.425
I was here, working.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.420
Was anyone with you?

08:56.430 --> 08:58.194
Yeah. Leon was here.
He's in the back

08:58.200 --> 08:59.326
If you want to
talk to him.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.866
Nora, we know you
had sex with him

09:00.870 --> 09:05.432
Come on. It happens to all
of us at one time or another.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.703
Admit it.

09:06.710 --> 09:07.666
Ok, ok.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.900
But usually, I'm
the one who dumps the guy.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.446
I don't get henry.

09:12.450 --> 09:13.940
He's no prize.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.975
Anyway, he changed
his routes.

09:15.980 --> 09:17.015
I haven't seen
him since.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.909
We'll need to verify
your alibi.

[screaming]

10:43.270 --> 10:45.261
Hey.
Hey.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.159
She nailed
the door shut.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.171
Yeah. She made entry
and exit through the window.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.705
The guys lifted
her prints.

10:50.710 --> 10:51.939
Who found him?
The neighbors.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.874
Heard him yelling
for help, called it in.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.542
She was interrupted
at the bus yard.

10:57.550 --> 10:59.279
She trapped him
in here so she could

10:59.290 --> 11:00.314
Finish what
she started.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.482
She nailed his hands
to the headboard, too.

11:02.490 --> 11:05.255
Impalement is a forceful
and violent release

11:05.260 --> 11:06.682
Of repression.

Maybe a sadistic

Deriving
power and control

11:09.800 --> 11:11.666
By inflicting pain,

11:11.670 --> 11:13.320
But why his hands?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.990
She was taking
ownership.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.229
He had nothing
to fight back with.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.607
She wanted him
to feel helpless.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.237
He's gonna have scars.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.708
People will notice
and ask what happened.

11:21.710 --> 11:24.099
He'll have to relive the
attack over and over again.

11:24.110 --> 11:26.408
If she wanted him dead,
he would be.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.616
He m.O. Is to maim,
not kill.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.769
The attacks were
a day apart.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.349
After the first one,
wouldn't you lay low,

11:31.350 --> 11:32.715
Let some time pass
since you know

11:32.720 --> 11:34.347
The cops are
looking for you?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.658
She couldn't wait.
She needed a fix.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.287
She got sloppy
and left prints behind.

11:38.290 --> 11:41.555
But why is she
targeting henry?

11:43.660 --> 11:46.664
I didn't even know
she was in the room.

11:46.670 --> 11:48.126
She came up
behind me,

11:48.140 --> 11:49.790
She put me
in a choke hold.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.198
I couldn't breathe.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.531
I thought she was
gonna kill me,

11:53.540 --> 11:54.530
Then what happened?

11:54.540 --> 11:57.032
She spun me around,
and I saw her face,

11:57.050 --> 11:58.472
But it wasn't nora.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.800
She looked crazed.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.946
Can you describe her?

12:00.950 --> 12:04.443
About 5'5",
same Size as nora.

12:04.450 --> 12:06.441
She was wearing
all black.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.518
Do you know her?

12:07.520 --> 12:09.010
Yeah. I don't know
her name,

12:09.020 --> 12:10.852
But she rides
the bus.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.611
For how long?

12:11.630 --> 12:13.325
I don't know.
Sometimes, she sat

12:13.330 --> 12:16.891
On your route, where did
she get on and off the bus?

12:16.900 --> 12:19.164
She never really had
a specific stop.

12:19.170 --> 12:23.198
She always just
rode all over the city.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.804
Why is she
doing this to me?

12:25.810 --> 12:28.905
We're gonna find out,
I promise.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.571
Ben: Henry's got
a clean record.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.173
Any beef
with co-workers?

12:32.180 --> 12:33.841
No. No complaints
from anybody.

12:33.850 --> 12:35.079
Everyone seems
to really like him.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.616
He played baseball
in junior college

12:36.620 --> 12:37.815
And went out
on an injury,

12:37.820 --> 12:39.185
But he's been
a bus driver ever since.

12:39.190 --> 12:41.318
Never been married,
no whack job ex-girlfriends

12:41.320 --> 12:42.185
That we know of?

12:42.190 --> 12:43.453
No. I talked
to his family and friends.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.588
He doesn't come across
as someone with enemies.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.285
- Janice: We ran her
prints from the crime scene,

12:47.300 --> 12:48.699
But nothing came up
in the database.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.190
Most female stalkers
don't target strangers.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.861
It's usually someone
they've had

12:51.870 --> 12:53.099
Previous
contact with.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.295
She concealed
her identity

12:54.300 --> 12:56.234
During the first attack,
but then showed her face

12:56.240 --> 12:57.389
During the second one.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.809
That was a brazen
thing to do.

12:58.810 --> 12:59.800
Gave her
a bigger high.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.437
Maybe she doesn't
care about getting caught.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.771
Maybe she wants
to get get caught.

13:02.780 --> 13:04.874
I went back and looked at
henry's wounds from the first attack.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.200
She knew where to land
the punches and kicks.

13:06.210 --> 13:07.644
I mean, she hit him
right in the solar plexus.

13:07.650 --> 13:08.811
That knocks the wind
out of you.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.549
Anything from the bus yard
surveillance cameras?

13:10.550 --> 13:11.984
They were cut,
but I'm getting

13:11.990 --> 13:13.810
The daily footage
from inside henry's bus.

13:13.820 --> 13:15.117
Now that we have
her description,

13:15.120 --> 13:16.485
Let's go through
the footage and see

13:16.490 --> 13:19.755
If we can establish any
kind of pattern or routine.

13:19.760 --> 13:23.196
[music playing]

13:23.200 --> 13:24.690
How's it going,
danielle?

13:24.700 --> 13:26.668
A very uneventful day.

13:26.670 --> 13:29.367
Oh. Well, let's
change that.

13:29.370 --> 13:32.135
What are we gonna
do with your hair today?

13:32.140 --> 13:36.077
Something fun,
something drastic.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.139
Blond. Please.
You must.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.902
Blond will make
your eyes pop.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.308
You think?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.049
I was blond once
a long time ago.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.518
It wasn't much fun.

13:44.520 --> 13:48.957
Oh. Well, all the
reason to try it again.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.849
Ok. Talked me into it.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.928
I found our stalker
on the bus footage.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.989
Both henry and nora
confirm it was her.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.365
She always sits
in the same seat

14:01.370 --> 14:03.429
A few rows back
behind henry.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.602
Wait. Zoom in.

14:05.610 --> 14:08.204
She sat there so she
could be in his eye line.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.280
What does that mean?

14:09.280 --> 14:13.979
Ben, fly her picture. Let's get
a bolo broadcast out on her.

14:26.790 --> 14:29.555
[hair dryer blowing]

15:06.570 --> 15:08.664
Ohh! Yaah!
Oh, my god

15:08.670 --> 15:11.492
Danielle, you scared
the hell out of me.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.705
What are you
doing here?

15:12.710 --> 15:14.599
My name isn't danielle.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.430
Aah! Ow!

15:16.440 --> 15:18.943
What are you doing?

15:18.950 --> 15:21.669
Aah!

15:21.680 --> 15:24.570
No. Ohh.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.445
No, no. Aah!

15:26.450 --> 15:28.282
Ohh! Aah!

15:28.290 --> 15:31.590
No! Aah!

15:31.590 --> 15:32.989
[sobbing]

15:32.990 --> 15:35.391
[screaming]

15:44.570 --> 15:45.867
[sighs]

15:45.870 --> 15:46.962
Thanks.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.129
Morning.
Good morning.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.869
I got a call
from central station.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.507
A hair stylist was
attacked by a woman

15:51.510 --> 15:54.445
Matching our stalker's
description last night.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.009
Looks like we have
a serial stalker.

15:56.020 --> 15:59.046
But she's gone from male
victim to female victim.

15:59.050 --> 16:00.188
There's no pattern.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.750
Her psychology
doesn't track.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.683
Janice and I will take
the interview.

16:04.690 --> 16:08.354
Sure. You ok?

16:08.360 --> 16:09.327
Yeah.

16:09.330 --> 16:12.595
You seem distracted.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.625
All good here.

16:26.850 --> 16:29.148
Hey, beautiful.

16:29.150 --> 16:31.949
I called you,
left a couple of messages.

16:31.950 --> 16:36.456
I'm sorry. It's been
crazy busy today.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.679
I've been thinking
about you.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.728
I've been thinking
about you, too.

16:41.730 --> 16:44.028
I miss you is all.

16:44.030 --> 16:46.089
You free tonight?

16:46.100 --> 16:49.491
Um, one of our
managers called in sick,

16:49.500 --> 16:52.060
So I'm gonna be
here late.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.606
We've had
late nights before.

16:53.610 --> 16:57.399
Not tonight. I've got
early morning shift, too.

16:57.410 --> 16:59.139
Please understand.

16:59.150 --> 17:01.369
I'll call you later.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.279
Is this the woman
who attacked you?

17:11.290 --> 17:13.054
Yes. She's a client
of mine.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.380
What's her name?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.789
Danielle,
but last night,

17:16.800 --> 17:18.928
She said that
wasn't her name.

17:18.930 --> 17:20.989
It was so creepy.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.434
Tell us
what happened.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.499
I was leaving the salon
last night

17:24.510 --> 17:25.762
When she came
out of nowhere.

17:25.770 --> 17:30.833
She attacked me, and
she ripped off all my clothes.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.648
It's ok, baby.

17:32.650 --> 17:34.379
She threw disinfectant
in my face,

17:34.380 --> 17:38.510
And she strapped me
to the chair.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.080
She grabbed a pair
of scissors.

17:41.090 --> 17:43.684
I was terrified
she was gonna stab me,

17:43.690 --> 17:46.421
But--she was crazy.

17:46.430 --> 17:49.127
She said she wanted to
give me a new look.

17:49.130 --> 17:52.065
I couldn't see
it burned so badly.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.596
How long has she
been a client?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.695
6 weeks. I mean,
she was always so nice.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.304
I don't know why
she would do this to me.

18:00.310 --> 18:01.539
You're her
second victim.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.939
She was talking you
both in plain sight,

18:02.940 --> 18:04.999
Getting to know you,
sitting in your chair,

18:05.010 --> 18:06.409
Figuring out
your schedule.

18:06.410 --> 18:09.141
First victim was
a bus driver henry white.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.618
Do you know him?

18:10.620 --> 18:12.145
No, I don't.

18:12.150 --> 18:14.187
Why'd you look away
just now?

18:14.190 --> 18:18.149
I was just thinking, um,
if I knew him, but I don't.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.958
His name's not
familiar.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.826
So you don't know
henry white?

18:21.830 --> 18:22.991
She already said
she doesn't.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.957
I think my wife's
been through enough.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.120
Scott, it's ok.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.199
You think
you'll find her?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.692
We're doing
our best.

18:33.510 --> 18:35.160
I spoke to the gal at the
salon who does the books.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.602
She said her stalker
always paid in cash.

18:36.610 --> 18:39.307
There's no credit card on
file we can trace back to her.

18:39.310 --> 18:41.108
I followed up
with henry.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.610
He claims not to
know sophia either.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.247
I think sophia's lying.
I think she knows henry,

18:44.250 --> 18:45.513
Which means there's
a connection

18:45.520 --> 18:46.817
Between our two victims.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.584
Let's find it.

18:48.590 --> 18:50.558
Excuse me.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.130
Did something happen?

18:53.130 --> 18:55.189
He came
to the restaurant.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.258
Come on.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.295
Who's that?

18:57.300 --> 18:59.928
I don't know.
A friend?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.661
Beth has a friend?

19:02.670 --> 19:04.160
I never returned
his calls,

19:04.170 --> 19:05.331
So he stopped by
to see me.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.729
I tried to hide it, but
I can tell he knows.

19:07.740 --> 19:10.277
You're not going home.
You're gonna stay with me.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.270
Beth, I'm scared.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.805
He won't come to my house.
It's too risky.

19:12.810 --> 19:14.801
I'll get a patrol car,
have him stay with you

19:14.820 --> 19:19.018
Yeah. This is lieutenant beth
davis. I need to request a patro--

19:19.020 --> 19:21.887
We got hit on a photo in the
missing persons database.

19:21.890 --> 19:22.812
I think it's her.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.118
All right.
I'll get back to you.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.280
Excuse me, trace.

19:28.230 --> 19:29.220
What's her story?

19:29.230 --> 19:30.629
Cori james, 30,
born and raised in LA.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.268
She's been missing
for two months.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.692
Who filed
the report?

19:33.700 --> 19:36.067
Her mother
barbara james.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.731
Is this a new case?

19:37.740 --> 19:39.299
It's a friend
of mine.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.802
Oh. Do you need help
with anything?

19:41.810 --> 19:45.007
I need 5 minutes.
I'll check this out.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.680
So you haven't
found cori?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.681
Not yet, I'm afraid.

19:52.690 --> 19:53.987
Take a look
at this picture.

19:53.990 --> 19:56.186
It was pulled from an
|.A. Bus security video.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.817
It was taken
last week.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.320
That's cori.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.980
Oh, I'm so glad
she's ok.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.526
Ms. James, your daughter's
wanted for questioning

20:03.530 --> 20:05.396
In an ongoing
investigation.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.822
When was the last time
you saw her?

20:06.830 --> 20:11.040
She used to come over
every other Sunday for dinner,

20:11.040 --> 20:12.599
And one week,
she didn't show up.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.032
I called,
I left a message.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.166
She didn't call back.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.274
She stopped showing
up for work.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.204
What was cori's mood
like on her last visit?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.472
She was upset.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.175
Her friend meg
from high school

20:23.180 --> 20:25.945
Recently died
of a drug overdose.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.884
Cori took it hard.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.312
They were close.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.856
How close?

20:30.860 --> 20:32.157
Like sisters.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.186
Cori always
took care of meg.

20:35.200 --> 20:35.928
Is this them?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.398
That was taken
freshman year

20:37.400 --> 20:39.129
Before meg got
into drugs.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.360
Cori's changed a lot
over the years.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.498
Well, she took up
karate in tenth grade

20:43.500 --> 20:45.366
And threw away
all her dresses,

20:45.370 --> 20:46.701
Stopped wearing
makeup

20:46.710 --> 20:48.166
Or caring
about her appearance.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.477
Did you ever talk
to her about that?

20:49.480 --> 20:52.609
I tried a few times,
but she had her walls up.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.977
I knew she was
going through something,

20:54.980 --> 20:57.574
And it killed me that
I couldn't help her.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.584
Would you mind showing us
your daughter's old bedroom?

21:06.230 --> 21:12.693
She only went to one dance the whole
4 years of high school, homecoming.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.725
I tried to encourage her
to go out more often,

21:14.740 --> 21:17.869
But she wasn't
interested.

21:17.870 --> 21:21.500
It made me said she
didn't have more friends.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.380
Would you mind if we
borrow cori's yearbook?

21:25.380 --> 21:28.372
It might help us
figure out where she is.

21:28.380 --> 21:29.939
Sure, and if you
find her,

21:29.950 --> 21:33.716
Will you please tell her
how much I miss her?

21:33.720 --> 21:35.381
Of course.

21:35.390 --> 21:37.586
Ben: Two faces were
blacked out in cori's yearbook.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.786
They belong to henry white
and sophia logan,

21:39.790 --> 21:41.952
Her maiden name, which is
why I couldn't find a connection.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.224
So our stalker went to
school with both of her victims.

21:44.230 --> 21:47.120
Scribbling or blacking out
someone's photo-- she's angry.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.189
Cori was mad because of something
that happened back in high school.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.362
Well, judging by the
dramatic shift in personality

21:52.370 --> 21:54.509
And appearance,
sudden social withdrawal,

21:54.510 --> 21:57.810
Cori may have suffered
some kind of traumatic event.

21:57.810 --> 22:00.108
Or rape. Poor
performance in school,

22:00.110 --> 22:01.976
Hypervigilance--
these are all common

22:01.980 --> 22:03.470
Behavioral side effects
of rape trauma syndrome.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.539
So cori attacked henry
because he raped her?

22:05.550 --> 22:07.587
Psychologically, it
doesn't make any sense.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.513
Rape victims usually
go for the genitals.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.386
Henry was nailed
through the hands.

22:11.390 --> 22:13.279
What was sophia
guilty of?

22:13.290 --> 22:16.692
We need to get them both in
here, find out what they're hiding.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.156
Sophia: Has there been
a break in the case?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.559
Yes. We believe you're
being targeted by someone

22:20.570 --> 22:22.538
You went to
high school with.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.668
High school? Really?

22:24.670 --> 22:26.468
Your stalker's name
is cori james.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.132
These are a couple
pages from her yearbook.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.201
As you can see, your
photo has been blacked out.

22:32.210 --> 22:33.746
Along with henry
white's, but you said

22:33.750 --> 22:34.979
You didn't
know him, right?

22:34.980 --> 22:37.813
That's right.
I don't.

22:40.090 --> 22:41.910
I think you're lying,
sophia.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.684
I think you do
know henry and cori james.

22:43.690 --> 22:46.387
You obviously went
to high school together.

22:46.390 --> 22:47.755
Were you friends,
enemies?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.228
I told you I don't
know them,

22:49.230 --> 22:52.461
And if we did go to school
together, we never met.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.791
186 students in your
graduating class.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.995
You were voted
most popular

22:56.000 --> 22:57.434
And student body
secretary.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.501
Still, never met?

23:03.640 --> 23:05.608
Well, I'm gonna go
talk to henry,

23:05.610 --> 23:08.375
See what he has
to stay.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.824
Henry still claims
he doesn't know sophia.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.959
It's ok. Sophia already
told us everything.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.257
What are you
talking about?

23:24.270 --> 23:28.161
She told us about how you raped
cori james back in high school.

23:28.170 --> 23:31.231
You're going to jail for
a very long time, henry.

23:31.240 --> 23:36.804
Bitch. She's lying.
She's lying. It wasn't me.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.778
It was scott mason.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.340
Sophia's husband?

23:41.350 --> 23:42.545
Yeah.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.814
On it.

23:44.820 --> 23:47.187
Ha! You're funny.

23:47.190 --> 23:50.353
You've got a really
dark sense of humor.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.728
That's what all
the girls tell me.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.755
Have we met before?

23:55.760 --> 23:57.899
I don't know.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.868
You tell me.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.060
No. No.
We haven't met

24:04.070 --> 24:05.367
Because I would have
remembered

24:05.370 --> 24:08.829
A pretty face
like yours.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.537
Do you want to
get out of here?

24:11.550 --> 24:13.405
Let's go.

24:23.820 --> 24:25.015
I can't reach
scott mason.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.782
There's no answer on
his mobile or home phone.

24:26.790 --> 24:30.420
Get a warrant to ping his
cell. We have to find him.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.966
You want to stay out
of jail, henry?

24:35.970 --> 24:42.535
You better tell me
everything that happened now.

24:42.540 --> 24:45.771
Time to come clean,
sophia.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.077
<i>I know scott raped cord,</i>

24:47.080 --> 24:50.072
And I know you
and henry helped.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.946
I'm not saying anything
without a lawyer.

24:51.950 --> 24:54.885
The statute of limitations on
rape in california's 10 years.

24:54.890 --> 24:56.380
You can't be charged
with anything.

24:56.390 --> 24:58.518
Neither can your husband.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.453
Come on.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.749
Sophia, I see the shame
and the guilt.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.660
It's right there just
beneath the surface.

25:08.670 --> 25:12.129
It wants to come out.
It's time.

25:16.110 --> 25:19.569
Scott and I were hot
and heavy in high school.

25:19.580 --> 25:22.880
After he left
for college,

25:22.880 --> 25:25.884
I could tell he was
losing interest.

25:25.890 --> 25:29.281
It was homecoming.
Scott was back,

25:29.290 --> 25:32.851
And were partying at
the botanical gardens.

25:32.860 --> 25:35.557
He was bragging about
some deal he signed

25:35.560 --> 25:37.096
With a minor league
team.

25:37.100 --> 25:41.799
He kept flirting
with cori and meg.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.165
I was so jealous.

25:45.170 --> 25:48.367
I couldn't stand the thought
of losing him.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.532
It was late.
Cori and meg,

25:51.550 --> 25:53.700
They kept
hanging around.

25:53.710 --> 25:56.645
I mean, they were
in awe of scott.

25:56.650 --> 26:01.679
- We were all in awe
of him, you know?

26:01.690 --> 26:06.230
He said to me that
they were asking for it

26:06.230 --> 26:09.757
And that he was
gonna give it to them.

26:09.760 --> 26:13.628
Then scott and meg
were making out.

26:13.630 --> 26:17.294
He was groping her.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.892
She said, "no,"

26:18.910 --> 26:22.505
But he forced her down.

26:22.510 --> 26:26.174
And the cori tried
to run.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.979
And I grabbed her,
and I held her down

26:33.990 --> 26:38.655
Until he could
finish.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.652
That explains the nails
in your hands.

26:41.660 --> 26:44.027
She wanted you to feel
her pain.

26:44.030 --> 26:47.466
Beth: You stood there,
watched, did nothing.

26:47.470 --> 26:49.962
That's why cori
burned your eyes.

26:49.970 --> 26:51.768
I didn't know
what else to do.

26:51.770 --> 26:56.139
I loved him so much.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.529
I still do.

27:05.090 --> 27:08.446
[music playing]

27:13.160 --> 27:15.549
Ooh. Someone's
in a hurry.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.630
Now don't be coy.

27:16.630 --> 27:19.895
I know you didn't drag
me out here just to dance.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.493
That is true.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.366
I do have something
else in mind.

27:23.370 --> 27:25.930
Ooh. All right.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.409
Well, I can't
wait forever.

27:28.410 --> 27:30.936
Oh, but there's something
that you should know.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.475
What is it?

27:32.480 --> 27:35.973
Well, see we have
met before.

27:35.980 --> 27:39.814
It was 16 years ago.

27:39.820 --> 27:41.310
Homecoming,

27:41.320 --> 27:44.984
The night that I gave it
to your and your friend.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.550
You little slut, I know
what you've been up do.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.120
Did you really think
that you could take me?

27:50.130 --> 27:51.052
Unh!

27:51.070 --> 27:54.825
Meg died because
of what you did to her.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.239
This is for her.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.197
Unh!

27:59.670 --> 28:02.037
Janice: You were
right about the rape.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.270
This is all about
retribution.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.679
Meg's death was
the trigger.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.639
It's what drove her to
seek justice for her friend.

28:09.650 --> 28:13.985
I hate that henry and
sophia both get to walk.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.310
They're the victims.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.312
This one's not
so black and white.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.025
Hey.

28:27.030 --> 28:30.762
Whatever's going on,
if you need anything--

28:30.770 --> 28:33.000
Nothing's going on.

28:33.010 --> 28:35.433
I get it.
You're my boss,

28:35.440 --> 28:40.469
And I've worked under you
for 4 years, and I respect you,

28:40.480 --> 28:42.778
But I also care.

28:42.780 --> 28:45.249
I know we have no real
personal relationship,

28:45.250 --> 28:48.015
But if you need
anything...

28:48.020 --> 28:49.988
Yeah. That's very, very
sweet of you, janice,

28:49.990 --> 28:53.483
But, uh,
everything's fine.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.222
Something is going on
with you.

29:00.230 --> 29:05.191
Let me in.
I want to help.

29:12.810 --> 29:14.574
I pinged
scott mason's phone.

29:14.580 --> 29:17.117
His gps shut off near
the end of candle drive.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.009
Isn't that near
the botanical gardens?

29:19.020 --> 29:22.854
She's taking him back
to the scene of the crime.

29:22.860 --> 29:24.715
Jack.

29:27.230 --> 29:28.550
Please. Stop.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.289
Oh, remember? I said
that very same thing,

29:30.300 --> 29:32.052
And you said,
"don't worry.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.028
It will all
be over soon."

29:45.550 --> 29:47.439
What are--what
are you gonna do?

29:47.450 --> 29:48.599
Oh, my god.
What are you--no, no!

29:48.620 --> 29:50.042
You took something
from us that night.

29:50.050 --> 29:52.314
Now I'm gonna take
something from you.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.039
You are never gonna
hurt anyone

29:55.060 --> 29:56.516
Ever again.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.851
No, no!
What are you doing?

29:57.860 --> 30:00.056
Please. No.
Don't do this!

30:00.060 --> 30:02.483
Oh, my god! No!

30:04.660 --> 30:07.027
No! Please!
Cori, please, no.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.362
I-I'm sorry.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.633
I'm sorry.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.234
[panting]

30:14.710 --> 30:16.064
Yeah.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.970
Met is dead.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.846
I'm sorry.

30:26.190 --> 30:29.182
[sirens]

30:34.460 --> 30:36.758
Let him go, cori.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.894
I got her.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.745
Cori?

30:53.750 --> 30:56.720
Cori, it's over.
I know about meg.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.745
I know what he did
to the both of you.

30:58.750 --> 31:01.879
I could help you
if you let me.

31:01.890 --> 31:05.315
When's the last time
you let someone help you?

31:08.860 --> 31:11.693
You don't want to
fight me, cori.

31:16.070 --> 31:17.959
I don't--I don't
want to hurt you.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.961
You won't.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.634
Let's go.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.703
Get her out of here.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.599
Yes, ma'am.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.639
Move.

32:07.390 --> 32:09.347
She's lying.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.714
I never raped anyone.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.859
She and her friend
were totally into it.

32:12.860 --> 32:14.828
Why would cori make
something like that up?

32:14.830 --> 32:16.355
She and meg were
freshman wannabes.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.351
They would have done anything
to be part of the cool crowd.

32:18.370 --> 32:23.035
Look. Maybe they were ashamed
and decided to blame someone else.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.259
I mean, obviously she's
mentally unstable, right?

32:25.270 --> 32:26.635
She did try to
cut off my penis.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.938
We've got two witnesses
who can corroborate

32:28.940 --> 32:30.738
Cori's story.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.301
One of them
is your wife.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.415
Sophia has always
been insecure, ok?

32:37.420 --> 32:39.843
She had convinced herself
that that's what happened

32:39.850 --> 32:43.514
Because she couldn't
accept that I lost interest in her

32:43.520 --> 32:47.229
And hooked up
with the other girls.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.395
I'm the victim here.

32:51.400 --> 32:55.223
No one's saying
you aren't.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.868
But you don't
believe me.

32:57.870 --> 32:59.599
Well, it doesn't
matter what you think

32:59.610 --> 33:01.408
Because there's nothing
you can do.

33:01.410 --> 33:06.769
Statute of limitations
ran out years ago.

33:08.980 --> 33:12.518
I gave them every
opportunity to apologize.

33:12.520 --> 33:15.285
I rode henry's bus,
sat in sophia's chair,

33:15.290 --> 33:19.249
<i>Hung out at soot's
favorite bar.</i>

33:19.260 --> 33:22.890
Not one of them
ever recognized me.

33:22.900 --> 33:26.621
You've changed, cori.

33:26.630 --> 33:27.791
I know that--

33:27.800 --> 33:29.290
No, you don't.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.029
No one does.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.963
I know it never
goes away,

33:32.970 --> 33:37.134
That it's always there like a
rock you carry in your pocket.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.269
Weighs you down,
and it holds you back,

33:40.280 --> 33:42.647
Keeps you in your past.

33:42.650 --> 33:46.280
Meg is dead
because of them.

33:46.290 --> 33:51.217
Why didn't you go to the
police all those years ago?

33:51.230 --> 33:55.224
I was afraid of what
my mom would think.

33:57.330 --> 34:02.097
We were out past curfew,
drinking.

34:02.100 --> 34:07.459
I wanted to forget
it ever happened.

34:07.470 --> 34:12.579
Now meg's dead
because of them,

34:12.580 --> 34:15.572
Because of me.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.675
I wouldn't ask
for help.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.679
You were Kids,

34:19.690 --> 34:22.250
And you went through
a serious trauma.

34:22.260 --> 34:26.583
No one can blame you for
how you reacted back then.

34:26.590 --> 34:31.096
I took karate so I
wouldn't be a victim again,

34:31.100 --> 34:35.469
But...Meg was fragile.

34:35.469 --> 34:39.168
I got her into rehab,
and she'd relapse.

34:39.170 --> 34:42.868
After she died, I
tried to file a report,

34:42.880 --> 34:45.076
But the cop at the
front desk told me I was

34:45.080 --> 34:46.900
Wasting my time.

34:46.909 --> 34:50.414
He referred me
to a self-help group.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.239
I walked out.

34:52.250 --> 34:55.788
I took things
in my own hands.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.028
What happens now?

35:00.030 --> 35:03.898
You're an adult. There are
consequences for your actions.

35:03.900 --> 35:08.599
<i>I know that,
but sooty,</i>

35:08.600 --> 35:13.231
He gets to go
free, doesn't he?

35:13.240 --> 35:16.369
Where's the justice
in that?

35:20.950 --> 35:22.202
[knock on door]

35:22.220 --> 35:23.415
S.1.D. Just sent
this over.

35:23.420 --> 35:25.718
It's marked
"urgent."

35:31.190 --> 35:33.181
Good news?

35:38.200 --> 35:39.395
Cori.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.959
What's going on?

35:40.970 --> 35:44.793
There's something
I want you to see.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.233
Ben.
Right this way.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.608
[music playing]

36:01.560 --> 36:05.554
Beth: We collected your dna
from the botanical gardens.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.688
We ran it
through our database,

36:07.690 --> 36:09.579
And we got a hit.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.058
A 15-year-old
northridge girl was raped

36:12.070 --> 36:14.266
After a high-school
baseball game.

36:14.270 --> 36:16.329
That's your thing,
right,

36:16.340 --> 36:20.038
And this one falls within
the statute of limitations,

36:20.040 --> 36:22.031
And I'm guessing
that if I keep digging

36:22.040 --> 36:27.672
Other girls will surface and more
changes will be brought against you.

36:31.420 --> 36:35.448
You are done.
We got you.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.706
Why the long face?

36:53.710 --> 36:55.360
This case bugs.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.836
I'll second that.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.069
The victims
were guilty,

36:58.080 --> 36:59.377
The stalker was
a victim.

36:59.380 --> 37:00.848
I don't like it
when it's gray.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.944
Keeps me up at night,
end up watching reality tv,

37:02.950 --> 37:05.317
Eat too much,
it gets ugly.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.209
I know the feeling.

37:07.220 --> 37:08.119
Good night.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.452
I'll walk out
with you. Janice?

37:10.460 --> 37:12.110
Eh, I have to finish
the paperwork.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.086
I'll be here awhile.

37:13.090 --> 37:16.594
Tomorrow.
Good night.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.762
[music continues]

37:26.210 --> 37:28.963
[cell phone ringing]

37:32.550 --> 37:33.699
Hi.
Hey, tracy.

37:33.710 --> 37:37.044
I picked up takeout. I'll
be there in 15 minutes, ok?

37:37.050 --> 37:39.610
I'm here,
guard at the door.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.339
I know it seems
like overkill.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.612
Not at all.

37:43.620 --> 37:45.952
I'll see you soon.

37:47.430 --> 37:50.456
Perry: Can I help
you with that?

37:53.270 --> 37:56.422
It's nice to see you,
lieutenant davis,

37:56.440 --> 38:00.729
But then, I mean, you
always stop off here for dinner.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.038
You love their
deli salads.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.202
The, uh, kale
and butternut squash,

38:05.210 --> 38:08.180
That's your
favorite, right?

38:08.180 --> 38:10.740
Why are you following
me, perry?

38:10.750 --> 38:15.984
Come on. You know
the answer to that.

38:15.990 --> 38:18.288
I'm obsessive.

38:18.290 --> 38:23.558
I have a severe obsessive
personality disorder that

38:23.560 --> 38:25.358
Can't be treated.

38:25.370 --> 38:31.662
One doctor even diagnosed
me as psychopathic.

38:31.670 --> 38:32.831
You need help.

38:32.840 --> 38:33.864
That's what they say,

38:33.870 --> 38:36.999
But my dad seems to
think that I'm perfect,

38:37.010 --> 38:43.200
So I'm just going
with that for now.

38:43.220 --> 38:45.245
How's tracy?

38:45.250 --> 38:47.116
I know you know.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.680
You'll never see
her again, perry.

38:49.690 --> 38:51.112
That's too bad.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.884
She was nice.

38:52.890 --> 39:00.422
Sad but... Tragic
like you.

39:00.430 --> 39:01.568
Get away
from my car.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.289
Or what? You gonna
hit me again?

39:04.300 --> 39:07.907
No one has ever touched
me like that.

39:07.910 --> 39:11.904
Why did you
smack me around?

39:11.910 --> 39:15.869
Was it because I remind
you of ray?

39:15.880 --> 39:17.109
I can understand that.

39:17.120 --> 39:21.387
Both rich kids,
protected by money.

39:21.390 --> 39:25.509
He really did a number
on you, didn't he?

39:25.530 --> 39:28.579
Killed your
whole family?

39:28.600 --> 39:31.991
How do you survive
something like that?

39:32.000 --> 39:36.062
Change your name, become
a detective, help others,

39:36.070 --> 39:43.033
But does it ever
get better, michelle?

39:44.910 --> 39:48.676
Please. I want to know.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.911
You want to hit me
right now, don't you?

39:51.920 --> 39:54.218
People are watching.

39:56.490 --> 39:59.380
They won't always be.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.362
I can't wait.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.730
[crying]

40:21.850 --> 40:25.218
[music playing]

40:38.560 --> 40:41.393
What is it?

40:41.400 --> 40:44.040
I messed up.

40:45.340 --> 40:47.968
I need your help.

40:49.310 --> 40:50.732
You got it.

40:50.740 --> 40:54.142
[music continues]
