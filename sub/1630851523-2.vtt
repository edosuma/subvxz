WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:07.440
ISAAC:
We are ghosts.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.742
While most spirits pass on

00:08.808 --> 00:10.110
to the afterlife, we are

00:10.176 --> 00:11.277
cursed to spend eternity...

00:11.344 --> 00:12.779
(gasps)

00:11.344 --> 00:12.779
Oh, and she's gone.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.547
Now what's going
to happen to the house?

00:14.614 --> 00:16.616
This must be them, the new
folks that own the house.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.285
Why don't we just
try haunting?

00:16.683 --> 00:19.285
Oh!

00:19.352 --> 00:21.287
We scare them away.
We're ghosts!

00:21.354 --> 00:22.622
We did it!

00:21.354 --> 00:22.622
(shouts)

00:22.689 --> 00:25.492
PETE:
W-Watch out!

00:22.689 --> 00:25.492
(gasps)

00:25.558 --> 00:26.593
Oh.

00:25.558 --> 00:26.593
(gasps)

00:26.659 --> 00:28.294
Oh, my God! Sam? Sam!

00:28.361 --> 00:29.763
I hope
you were at least as upset

00:29.829 --> 00:31.598
when I was technically dead
for three minutes.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.666
This can't be real.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.666
JAY:
What are you looking at?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.035
I think you're right.
She can see us.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.035
Uh-huh.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.036
(screams)

00:41.107 --> 00:43.276
(bird cawing)

00:44.277 --> 00:46.312
(sighs)

00:52.752 --> 00:55.155
(soft clattering)

01:03.530 --> 01:05.799
(gasps)

01:06.800 --> 01:09.502
(sighs):
Ah.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.670
Hello!

01:10.737 --> 01:13.773
(both screaming)

01:16.476 --> 01:18.077
(grunts)

01:19.446 --> 01:20.246
Well?

01:20.313 --> 01:22.248
Yup, she can still see us.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.583
Yes!

01:23.650 --> 01:24.851
Also, she's apparently
a little cranky

01:24.918 --> 01:26.252
before she's had her coffee.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.354
â™ª â™ª

01:33.359 --> 01:35.662
Troops, never before have we
possessed the ability

01:35.728 --> 01:37.597
to communicate with a Living.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.732
We are in uncharted waters.

01:39.799 --> 01:43.470
Those are worst type of waters,
unless, of course, you find cod.

01:43.536 --> 01:44.771
ISAAC:
This opens up intriguing

01:44.838 --> 01:47.106
possibilities
to get them to leave.

01:47.173 --> 01:48.808
Namely: diplomacy.

01:48.875 --> 01:49.742
Thankfully,
you're looking

01:49.809 --> 01:51.878
at the man who negotiated an end

01:51.945 --> 01:54.848
to the Siege
of Fort Ticonderoga.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.383
You surrendered unconditionally
to the British.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.685
But we lived
to fight another day.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.587
You died of dysentery
two weeks later.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.188
Did I?

02:02.255 --> 02:03.656
Thank you. Thank you.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.625
Point is: I'm good at talking.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.394
Don't talk to enemy,
destroy them.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.264
Then toast their deaths
with horns full of mead!

02:11.331 --> 02:13.333
Okay, that boy has
some serious anger issues.

02:13.399 --> 02:15.835
Why do we have to make
the Livings leave?

02:15.902 --> 02:18.137
It just seems
like such a bummer.

02:18.204 --> 02:19.873
Because, they're planning
on turning my beloved

02:19.939 --> 02:22.842
Woodstone Mansion into a hotel,
that's why. We'll be overrun!

02:22.909 --> 02:26.179
Exactly! We can't let
these invaders take our land.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.480
Do you hear it? At all?

02:27.547 --> 02:28.681
Do you hear the words
that you're saying?

02:28.748 --> 02:30.216
PETE:
You know, we don't have

02:30.283 --> 02:32.352
to talk her into leaving
or destroy anyone.

02:32.418 --> 02:35.321
We could just befriend her and
ask her not to open the hotel.

02:35.388 --> 02:38.625
So, no hotel, but the hot chick
stays? I like that plan.

02:38.691 --> 02:41.694
Yeah, could be useful to have
a Living that we can talk to.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.330
Ooh, I can get her
to look into the details

02:44.397 --> 02:46.566
surrounding my
mysterious death.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.835
Oh, please. You had
a heart attack.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.703
Which was likely
brought on by poisoning.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.703
Okay.

02:50.770 --> 02:54.407
My death, like my life,
was spectacular. Had to be!

02:54.474 --> 02:57.343
No way I went out from something
boring like a busted ticker.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.745
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.446
My doc was pretty worried
about my blood pressure.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.349
Luckily, didn't turn out
to be a problem. (laughs)

03:03.416 --> 03:05.418
Oh, what happened?

03:05.485 --> 03:08.354
There's an arr...
we've been through this.

03:09.789 --> 03:12.926
Jay! Where were you?

03:09.789 --> 03:12.926
I was in the attic.

03:12.992 --> 03:15.562
Are you okay?

03:12.992 --> 03:15.562
Jay, they're back.
I woke up,

03:15.628 --> 03:17.897
and one was in
the bathroom...

03:15.628 --> 03:17.897
Whoa, whoa, okay, okay.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.266
These are just residual effects
from your accident.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.734
What happened?

03:20.333 --> 03:21.734
I ran into the door

03:21.801 --> 03:23.703
when I tried to attack him
with a toilet brush.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.540
Um, is that like to ghosts what
wooden stakes are to vampires?

03:27.607 --> 03:28.942
It was the only thing handy!

03:29.008 --> 03:30.710
Please don't make fun of me.
I really saw one.

03:30.777 --> 03:34.314
Okay, okay. Um, have you seen
one since you hit your head?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.249
No.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.851
Do you think somehow hitting my
head the second time cured me?

03:38.918 --> 03:40.687
I mean, if you haven't seen one
since you hit your head,

03:40.753 --> 03:42.555
you're probably out
of the woods.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.555
Oh, my God.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.958
They're back! They're here.
They're all behind you.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.960
Hello! Sorry
about before.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.962
I don't see anybody.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.531
I would like to formally
open negotiations to discuss

03:51.598 --> 03:54.400
your withdrawal
from Woodstone Mansion.

03:51.598 --> 03:54.400
Hear, hear.

03:54.467 --> 03:55.835
There's a hippie and a Viking.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.270
Be gone!

03:55.902 --> 03:57.270
Peace!

03:57.337 --> 03:58.671
And a guy dressed like Hamilton.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.940
Hamilton? How do you
know about Hamilton?

04:01.007 --> 04:02.675
One of them's not wearing
any pants.

04:02.742 --> 04:06.312
Oh, yeah? You like that?

04:02.742 --> 04:06.312
Hi. Alberta.

04:06.379 --> 04:07.747
Can you help me find out
who murdered me?

04:07.814 --> 04:09.782
Hey, babe, remember
what the doctor said.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.385
You-you might experience
some visual disturbances.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.454
(gasping):
I'm sorry.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.389
Y-You're talking
about Alexander Hamilton?

04:16.456 --> 04:17.991
Did that little twerp
become famous?

04:18.057 --> 04:20.593
Wait. Isn't that the guy
on the ten-dollar bill?

04:18.057 --> 04:20.593
The what?

04:20.660 --> 04:22.328
They seem really real.

04:22.395 --> 04:23.830
Well, of course
we're real!

04:22.395 --> 04:23.830
We're right here.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.531
He's on paper currency?

04:23.896 --> 04:25.531
THORFINN: You're hearing us!

04:25.598 --> 04:27.567
Okay, but what do you think
is more likely? Do you think

04:27.634 --> 04:29.402
you're seeing ghosts,
or do you think

04:29.469 --> 04:31.437
you're suffering symptoms
of a severe concussion?

04:31.504 --> 04:33.640
ALL: Ghosts.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.640
Yeah.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.640
Obviously.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.008
Concussion.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.342
(overlapping chatter)

04:35.074 --> 04:36.342
No!

04:36.409 --> 04:38.378
They're all in your head.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.613
You just ignore them,
and they'll go away.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.615
Ignore us?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.615
Well, that's rude.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.317
You go get some rest

04:44.384 --> 04:46.653
because your man is
taking care of business.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.588
Do you know how that works?

04:46.719 --> 04:48.588
Mm... Oh.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.822
No. No, I do not.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.724
But the Internet does.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.724
The Internet?

04:51.791 --> 04:53.860
It's an invention for looking
up stock prices and porn.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.062
I'm gonna let the contractors
handle the big things.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.930
But you know what? Papa Bear's
gonna save some money

04:57.997 --> 04:59.632
where I can,
because we're not all

04:59.699 --> 05:01.501
Mr. Moneybags here, am I right?

05:01.567 --> 05:03.403
(gasps)
From where

05:03.469 --> 05:05.772
did you find this awful painting
of my philandering husband?

05:05.838 --> 05:07.774
Oh, yeah, Elias. I remember
when he sat for that painting.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.774
Mm.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.742
And then when he slept
with the artist.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.742
Yeah.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.612
Okay, I guess
I'll just go lie down.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.080
You're gonna be better
in no time.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.882
The bones have spoken,

05:15.948 --> 05:18.317
and they foresee
your doom!

05:18.384 --> 05:20.420
Right. Thanks.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.489
(drill whirring)

05:23.556 --> 05:25.692
(all exclaiming)

05:25.758 --> 05:28.561
(groans)

05:29.562 --> 05:31.931
What are you doing
in my room?

05:31.998 --> 05:35.435
Oh, yeah, this is gonna
make a dope man cave.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.435
What?

05:35.501 --> 05:38.938
A cave of men?
What does that even mean?

05:39.005 --> 05:41.441
(drill whirring)

05:41.507 --> 05:43.042
(both gasp)

05:43.109 --> 05:44.744
Oh, no.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.112
What are... what are you...
what are you doing?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.347
Oh, hey, Hetty. This is fun.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.483
(gasps)
This is not fun.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.119
This horrible man has destroyed
the sanctity of our rooms.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.555
Oh, it's like we're roommates.

05:55.621 --> 05:58.524
You got this.

05:55.621 --> 05:58.524
(drill whirs)

05:58.591 --> 06:00.026
Oh.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.026
Oh!

06:01.728 --> 06:03.730
Crap.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.730
Are you mad?

06:03.796 --> 06:05.665
You've made it even bigger!

06:05.732 --> 06:07.100
No, no, no, don't walk away!

06:07.166 --> 06:09.669
Yay!

06:09.736 --> 06:11.671
Hey, who's your favorite
boy ghost?

06:11.738 --> 06:13.439
I'd say Thor,
but he really scares me,

06:13.506 --> 06:14.707
but I kind of like that.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.642
You know what?
No. No, no, no, no.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.077
No, no, no.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.379
ISAAC:
This Jay fellow has

06:20.446 --> 06:21.981
ruined our ability
to communicate

06:22.048 --> 06:25.017
with Samantha by convincing her
that we are not real!

06:25.084 --> 06:27.153
Which is a serious setback.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.856
In the face of which,
a lesser leader

06:29.922 --> 06:31.424
might give up.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.793
Like, for instance--
oh, I don't know--

06:33.860 --> 06:35.128
Hamilton.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.597
Dude is obsessed.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.597
Mm.

06:37.663 --> 06:41.134
He was a terrible commander.
He was all about himself!

06:41.200 --> 06:44.036
Whereas I-- I was known
for making men under me happy.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.538
How are we supposed
to befriend Sam,

06:45.605 --> 06:47.774
or "drive her from the land,"

06:47.840 --> 06:49.509
yeah, yeah,
if she's just ignoring us?

06:49.575 --> 06:51.944
Enemy's not supposed to ignore.
It hurts feelings.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.679
We don't let her ignore us.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.414
We do the same thing
I did in '98

06:55.481 --> 06:57.416
when Lizzie Grubman told me
the list was closed

06:57.483 --> 07:00.119
for Diddy's White Party.
We keep bugging her!

07:00.186 --> 07:01.854
What kind of party?

07:00.186 --> 07:01.854
What is "Diddy"?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.122
It's a jaunty little song.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.557
The references
are not important!

07:04.624 --> 07:06.459
The point is,
we don't give up.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.628
We keep bugging her.
Now is when we double down!

07:08.694 --> 07:10.897
So simple, yet so brilliant.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.666
Thank you.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.666
We don't allow her to ignore us.

07:13.733 --> 07:14.667
(laughs)

07:13.733 --> 07:14.667
Yes.

07:14.734 --> 07:15.902
Yes, we will pester her

07:15.968 --> 07:17.737
in the kitchen.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.737
(others agreeing)

07:17.804 --> 07:19.839
And we will annoy her
in the living room.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.140
Yeah!

07:19.906 --> 07:21.140
My idea.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.875
We will make her life
a living hell

07:22.942 --> 07:26.479
so she has no choice
but to finally acknowledge us!

07:26.546 --> 07:27.814
Yes!

07:27.880 --> 07:29.448
And then we drive them
from this land!

07:29.515 --> 07:31.717
Yes!

07:29.515 --> 07:31.717
Or have a nice, friendly chat!

07:31.784 --> 07:32.985
That one. You do that one.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.985
(overlapping chatter)

07:33.052 --> 07:34.654
She will rue the day!

07:34.720 --> 07:36.923
Chop their legs off,
hang them from trees!

07:36.989 --> 07:38.991
Roll it back. It's too much!

07:36.989 --> 07:38.991
You're making it weird.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.532
PETE:
Hi there!

07:46.599 --> 07:48.568
Hello?

07:48.634 --> 07:49.836
All right, I know
you're actively ignoring us,

07:49.902 --> 07:51.170
but that's okay.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.872
I was married for 16 years,
so I get it.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.974
(laughs)

07:55.041 --> 07:56.776
Ah. Oh, you looked at me.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.878
She looked at me!
Ooh, it's working.

07:59.879 --> 08:03.182
Aah! Death to our enemies!

08:07.086 --> 08:08.688
Is it getting any better?

08:08.754 --> 08:09.922
Um...

08:09.989 --> 08:11.657
Now who would want me dead?

08:11.724 --> 08:13.926
I was a beloved
jazz singer.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.829
Not really.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.829
(yawns): I'm sorry, sweetie.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.831
I'm sure it'll be
better tomorrow.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.567
Okay, there was
one person.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.636
She thought I was having
an affair with her husband.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.004
(laughs)
I was sleeping with him,

08:25.071 --> 08:26.606
but she didn't know that,
so in a way,

08:26.672 --> 08:28.808
I kind of wasn't
as far as she knew.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.077
FLOWER:
So then the bear raised his arms
to attack me,

08:31.143 --> 08:32.245
but the shrooms were kicking in,

08:32.311 --> 08:33.746
and I thought
he just wanted a hug.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.147
You know, how everyone talks
about bear hugs?

08:35.214 --> 08:36.849
They're not talking
about hugs from actual bears.

08:36.916 --> 08:40.152
Can you please stop talking?
I'm trying to sleep.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.288
Oh, yeah. No, totally.
Yeah, no, I'm so tired, too.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.056
Why do we sleep?

08:44.123 --> 08:47.059
I don't know.

08:44.123 --> 08:47.059
When I was at Woodstock,

08:47.126 --> 08:49.562
I didn't sleep at all, 'cause
I didn't want to miss anything,

08:49.629 --> 08:50.863
especially the Grateful Dead.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.965
I was a huge "Deadhead,"
which was ironic,

08:53.032 --> 08:54.233
because I wasn't
even dead at the time.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.702
I don't care.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.107
(gasps)

09:01.173 --> 09:03.276
Look, I get it.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.545
Who wants to think they're
seeing ghosts? It's scary.

09:06.612 --> 09:09.315
You know what's scarier?
Eternity.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.984
So, I find ways to break it up,
create some drama.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.986
Like yesterday,
I told Alberta

09:14.053 --> 09:16.789
that Hetty said
she didn't like her hat.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.624
Now, did Hetty
really say that?

09:18.691 --> 09:22.028
Well, I will take that answer to
my grave, which will never come.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.130
Which is why I have
to do this kind of stuff.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.201
Oh, hi there. I'm Steve.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.938
Unbelievable.
Jay, there's another one!

09:32.004 --> 09:33.773
He's a big guy
with a greasy beard.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.141
Hey.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.141
JAY:
Hey, babe.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.609
Have you met Steve?

09:36.676 --> 09:39.211
Here you go.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.211
Wait. You can see him?

09:39.278 --> 09:40.780
W-What's happening?

09:40.846 --> 09:42.682
Sam, Steve! He's here
to help us with the cable.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.584
Who is this man?
Another invader?

09:45.651 --> 09:47.653
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, Steve.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.922
I haven't been sleeping well.
It's great to meet you.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.991
Um, that should about do it.
I went ahead

09:52.058 --> 09:53.893
and gave you three months
of the sports package.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.893
Cool.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.928
He too shall
feel our wrath.

09:55.995 --> 09:56.929
Shut up,

09:56.996 --> 09:58.698
uh...

09:58.764 --> 10:01.300
â™ª About that sports
package, Steve. â™ª

10:01.367 --> 10:02.935
What a deal!

10:03.002 --> 10:05.171
Yeah. R-Right?

10:05.237 --> 10:07.239
I'm-I'm...
I'm gonna test her out.

10:07.306 --> 10:10.609
(cheering)

10:10.676 --> 10:11.711
ANNOUNCER:
The Vikings were known

10:11.777 --> 10:13.045
for their prowess
on the battlefield,

10:13.112 --> 10:14.947
often overpowering...

10:15.014 --> 10:18.651
What is this...
magical window?

10:18.718 --> 10:19.652
Hello!

10:19.719 --> 10:22.021
Oh, okay. Well, I'm down
for a stroll. (laughs)

10:22.088 --> 10:24.357
Where we headed?
On behalf of my fellow ghosts,

10:24.423 --> 10:26.092
I'd just like to
welcome you to...

10:24.423 --> 10:26.092
You're not real.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.893
I mean, I'm not technically
alive, but I am real.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.995
No, you're not.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.396
You're answering me.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.396
No, I'm not.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.931
Okay, I thought
of a couple other people

10:31.998 --> 10:33.332
who may have wanted me dead.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.867
Any chance you could
hop the train down to Memphis

10:34.934 --> 10:36.402
and knock on some doors?

10:34.934 --> 10:36.402
Hey, am I crazy,

10:36.469 --> 10:38.738
or is there chemistry here?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.738
This isn't happening!

10:38.804 --> 10:41.307
I know.
I didn't expect this, either.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.210
ISAAC:
Okay, so this machine
truly has access

10:44.276 --> 10:45.911
to the entire breadth
of human knowledge?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.780
Yeah, pretty much.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.149
Okay, I need you to look up
"Alexander Hamilton" on this.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.385
(laughs)

10:52.451 --> 10:54.720
Do you know how long
it would take me

10:54.787 --> 10:56.188
to type all those letters?

10:56.255 --> 10:58.157
I must know
what he went on to do.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.157
(scoffs)

10:58.224 --> 11:01.160
He haunts me,
and I'm a damn ghost.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.230
(sniffles)

11:01.227 --> 11:04.230
Okay, buddy, stand back.

11:04.296 --> 11:06.365
Let me work my magic.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.201
(rhythmic exhaling)

11:09.268 --> 11:10.803
(inhales sharply)

11:10.870 --> 11:12.838
My God, the pageantry.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.707
Do you want this, or not?

11:12.905 --> 11:14.707
Yes. No, I do.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.776
Shh!

11:14.774 --> 11:16.776
I... I like it.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.046
Ah...

11:16.842 --> 11:20.046
Come on! Come on!

11:20.112 --> 11:21.680
You've got it!
You've got it!

11:21.747 --> 11:23.382
Ah...

11:21.747 --> 11:23.382
And...

11:28.754 --> 11:30.689
Ah!

11:28.754 --> 11:30.689
(laughs)

11:32.992 --> 11:35.261
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.696
Oh, amazing. Okay, next
letter. Next letter!

11:35.327 --> 11:37.696
Oh...

11:37.763 --> 11:40.733
Mmm. Thor can smell
the salty brine.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.334
There's my toolbox.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.334
ANNOUNCER:
The preparation for the cod hunt

11:42.401 --> 11:43.803
was a ritual of great importance

11:43.869 --> 11:45.137
in Viking society.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.137
Look at you.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.774
Come on! Electricity!

11:48.841 --> 11:51.410
Oh, by the loins of Freya, why?

11:51.477 --> 11:53.245
Small man?!

11:53.312 --> 11:55.347
(water dripping)

11:57.416 --> 11:59.819
Well, if it isn't
"Mr. Fix It."

11:59.885 --> 12:02.121
Why has he got a hammer?

11:59.885 --> 12:02.121
Who knows?

12:02.188 --> 12:04.156
Okay.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.156
Oh, no, no.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.258
Oh, no. Oh, you fool!

12:06.325 --> 12:07.393
What are you doing?

12:06.325 --> 12:07.393
Is he crazy, man?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.161
Stop it! Just stop it!

12:09.228 --> 12:11.730
God, I know we're dead,
but he's trying to kill us.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.967
"Psychotic breaks."

12:15.034 --> 12:17.169
Okay, that's me.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.169
HETTY:
A moment of your time.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.205
That's also me.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.205
You must repair my wall.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.906
I cannot spend another night
listening

12:20.973 --> 12:22.741
to that bohemian blather away.
I won't do it!

12:22.808 --> 12:24.243
Bring back my people
to the thing--

12:24.310 --> 12:25.911
the sorcerer's window!

12:25.978 --> 12:27.480
You are a strong, sane woman.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.348
You are a strong,
sane woman!

12:29.415 --> 12:31.150
Hey, big head.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.186
I don't want you anyway.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.189
See? Say something negative,
get 'em off balance.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.925
Oh, I don't know why
I didn't start with this.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.925
"Depression,

12:39.992 --> 12:41.427
difficulty concentrating..."

12:41.494 --> 12:43.095
JAY:
Babe, can you please
bring me my screwdriver?

12:43.162 --> 12:44.463
Sure thing.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.966
She moves!

12:44.530 --> 12:46.966
Do not walk away from me!

12:47.032 --> 12:50.302
She can't move too fast with
those slightly-too-large ankles!

12:50.369 --> 12:52.171
This is genius.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.206
You cannot escape us!

12:52.238 --> 12:54.206
(gasps) Oh!

12:54.273 --> 12:56.342
No way I'm going
down there.

12:56.408 --> 12:58.911
No, no, they...
they are terrifying.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.847
Jay, I think there's something
very wrong... Oh, my God!

13:01.914 --> 13:03.382
What?

13:01.914 --> 13:03.382
What do you mean, "what?"

13:03.449 --> 13:04.483
There's a bunch
of zombies down here.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.986
Zombies?
Zombies aren't real.

13:07.052 --> 13:08.888
We are ghosts.
We all died of cholera.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.823
It wasn't great.

13:10.890 --> 13:14.126
Babe, I think you really
just need some more rest.

13:14.193 --> 13:17.930
We are way past rest. We need
to go to a hospital now.

13:17.997 --> 13:19.532
Okay. Well, I'll drive you.

13:19.598 --> 13:20.799
Red valve. Tell him...

13:20.866 --> 13:23.369
(loud, overlapping chatter)

13:23.435 --> 13:24.403
Please turn the red valve!

13:24.470 --> 13:25.871
Can you turn the red valve?

13:25.938 --> 13:27.840
What?

13:25.938 --> 13:27.840
Can you just turn the red valve?

13:27.907 --> 13:30.876
It-it's kind of urgent,
if you like the house.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.213
MAN: There you go!

13:32.344 --> 13:34.213
WOMAN: Yes.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.248
How did you know
about the red...?

13:36.315 --> 13:38.450
Can we get the hell out
of here, please?

13:39.451 --> 13:41.820
Okay.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.820
No. Wait. Don't do that.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.522
Oh, come on...

13:41.887 --> 13:43.522
Oh. Nuts.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.429
I'm just saying, it's been
three days, and I'm not feeling

13:50.496 --> 13:52.831
any better, so I'm starting
to freak out.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.967
Well, I have to be honest.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.602
I don't think this
will get better.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.905
What?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.905
It seems as if your
accident left you so close

13:59.972 --> 14:02.107
to death, that you somehow
obtained the ability

14:02.174 --> 14:04.143
to actually see
dead people.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.143
(laughs)

14:04.210 --> 14:05.477
That can't be possible...

14:05.544 --> 14:07.580
It is quite rare,
but I've seen it before.

14:07.646 --> 14:10.316
The last time was
around 85 years ago.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.084
Wait. How-how old are you?

14:12.151 --> 14:14.920
Well, I was about 50
when I died.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.022
Now, sorry about that.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.291
I'll let you visit
with your living doctor.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.126
What seems to be
troubling you?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.126
(gasps)

14:21.193 --> 14:23.229
She's excellent, by the way.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.902
THORFINN (laughing):
This is amazing.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.370
The plan's working!

14:31.437 --> 14:33.539
Working? Thor,
she ran off screaming.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.974
We've driven her insane.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.076
Oh, what does it matter?
Nothing matters.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.044
What's up
with soldier boy?

14:37.142 --> 14:39.044
Isaac had me look up

14:39.111 --> 14:41.380
"Alexander Hamilton"
on Jay's computer.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.982
His list of accomplishments
was even grander

14:43.048 --> 14:44.416
than I could have imagined.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.518
And then we looked up Isaac.

14:46.585 --> 14:51.290
"...graduated Dartmouth,
died of dysentery."

14:51.357 --> 14:54.526
That's it?
That's all it says?!

14:54.593 --> 14:58.464
I was mentioned in but one
academic journal, in a footnote.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.066
I'm literally a footnote
in history!

15:01.133 --> 15:02.301
Well, Dartmouth is very good.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.369
(coughing):
Safety school.

15:03.435 --> 15:05.371
My life meant nothing.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.673
Whereas my rival is known
to this day.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.042
There was even a musical
about him!

15:10.109 --> 15:12.077
You're really fixated
on that musical thing.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.946
Well, this might come
as a shock to you,

15:14.013 --> 15:16.615
since you see me
as this tough military type...

15:14.013 --> 15:16.615
Mm.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.551
...but musical theater
is actually a passion of mine.

15:19.618 --> 15:21.120
Hmm.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.290
I'm just saying, maybe we
should have just stuck around

15:24.356 --> 15:26.091
for a little while,
heard her out.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.426
Maybe done the MRI?

15:27.493 --> 15:28.594
There's no point.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.162
They're not gonna
find anything,

15:30.229 --> 15:32.064
because I now know
there's nothing wrong with me!

15:32.131 --> 15:33.666
Okay, but the
doctor said...

15:33.732 --> 15:35.301
That was the living doctor!

15:35.367 --> 15:36.935
Of course she thinks
I'm delusional.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.504
She's not trained for this.
But the ghost doctor...

15:38.570 --> 15:40.472
Okay, that's where
you start to lose me.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.974
If the ghosts were
all in my head,

15:42.041 --> 15:43.342
I'd be seeing the same ones
at the hospital

15:43.409 --> 15:45.010
as I do back at the house,
but they're not.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.578
I see different ones
in different places.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.447
Like that guy. Hey, bud.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.451
What guy?

15:52.518 --> 15:56.021
I know it's not great news,
but at least I'm not crazy.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.025
No, no, Jay,
look out!

16:00.092 --> 16:01.527
(tires screech)

16:01.593 --> 16:04.296
Phew. They were already dead.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.098
Sorry.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.098
What?!

16:06.165 --> 16:08.634
Just drive.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.634
I can't. I can't. I-I...

16:14.340 --> 16:18.110
Listen, I know this is
a lot, but I'm with you.

16:18.177 --> 16:21.013
No matter what, in
sickness and in health.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.716
Okay? Because I love you.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.718
Aw. He's a keeper.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.718
(gasps)

16:25.784 --> 16:28.554
Hold that thought.

16:25.784 --> 16:28.554
What was that?

16:28.620 --> 16:30.289
Sam?!

16:28.620 --> 16:30.289
Sam?

16:30.356 --> 16:31.690
Sam?

16:31.757 --> 16:33.992
Hold on. Hold up, Sam!

16:34.793 --> 16:37.029
Sam, was there one in the car?

16:37.096 --> 16:39.131
Sam, was there one
in the car?

16:40.132 --> 16:41.633
(door opens)

16:40.132 --> 16:41.633
PETE: She's coming.
Here she comes!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.035
Ooh!

16:43.102 --> 16:44.403
Okay, fine.
I see all of you,

16:44.470 --> 16:46.305
I admit your existence. Happy?

16:46.372 --> 16:48.707
Well, I mean, what is happy?

16:46.372 --> 16:48.707
It's a good step, babe.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.643
Great. But this
is our house now.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.213
We inherited it, so, it is
time for you all to leave.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.048
It has been nice
to meet you, thank you,

16:56.115 --> 16:57.683
but you can go haunt
someone else now.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.154
(laughter)

17:02.221 --> 17:04.089
She's funny, too.
That's great.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.124
ALBERTA:
Girl,

17:05.190 --> 17:06.558
we can't leave.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.026
Yeah, you just sort of stay
where you die.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.328
And how you die.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.063
It's your classic
haunted house.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.065
So, it seems
it's the two of you

17:13.132 --> 17:14.800
who should leave,
thank you kindly.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.502
Well, that's not happening.

17:16.568 --> 17:18.036
We've already sunk all
our money into this place.

17:18.103 --> 17:19.705
Plus, I see dead people
wherever I go,

17:19.772 --> 17:21.540
so leaving doesn't even help me.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.041
Okay, I'm back
to freaked out again.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.376
Babe, just a second.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.778
It seems like we're stuck
with each other.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.613
But it is not going to go on
like this,

17:27.679 --> 17:29.348
with all of you up in my face
all of the time.

17:29.415 --> 17:31.717
So, what is it going to take
for you to leave me alone?

17:31.784 --> 17:34.720
Huh? What do you want?

17:34.787 --> 17:37.189
You! Viking guy,
what do you want?

17:37.256 --> 17:41.527
I want to see my people
in the magic box once a day!

17:41.593 --> 17:44.563
What?

17:41.593 --> 17:44.563
He wants to watch a show
about Vikings on TV.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.365
Fine.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.365
Yes!

17:46.432 --> 17:48.567
You, Wolf of Wall Street,
what do you want?

17:48.634 --> 17:51.336
Leave him, kill yourself,
become a ghost and get with me.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.238
But let's keep it casual.

17:53.305 --> 17:54.773
Gross. You.

17:53.305 --> 17:54.773
What'd he say?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.708
I heard you mention
you were a writer.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.744
I'd like you
to pen my biography, so that

17:58.811 --> 18:00.312
history may know my name.

18:00.379 --> 18:01.847
Now that is actually
quite interesting.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.316
And then take that book,
and adapt it

18:04.383 --> 18:05.751
into an award-winning
Broadway musical.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.719
I want you to invite
the descendants

18:07.786 --> 18:10.122
of the ten most likely suspects
of my murder to a dinner party.

18:10.189 --> 18:13.158
Find out who did it,
and exact revenge.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.660
(laughs)
No.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.762
Uh, you, Woodstock--
what do you want?

18:14.726 --> 18:16.762
Woodstock?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.697
Uh, I'm easy.
Just world peace.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.432
And an end
to bear attacks?

18:20.499 --> 18:22.668
Sure. You? Downton Abbey?

18:22.734 --> 18:24.703
Take down that painting
of my awful husband,

18:24.770 --> 18:27.539
and patch up the hole your
awful husband put in my wall.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.107
He's not awful when
you get to know him.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.709
Wait a minute.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.709
You, next.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.846
I'd like the entire Hudson
Valley returned to the Lenape.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.614
Barring that, maybe keep
the radio on in the afternoons?

18:35.681 --> 18:36.849
Mm, excellent idea.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.849
That's a good one.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.684
Yes!

18:36.915 --> 18:38.684
We could use
some beats in here.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.352
Oh, I'd love to dance.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.352
ALBERTA:
Play my album, Bonsoir.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.421
That would be fun.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.421
Okay, so that is everybody.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.755
(clears throat)

18:43.822 --> 18:46.125
Oh, what about you?

18:46.191 --> 18:48.460
I just wanted to
say hi and welcome.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.696
Hi.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.696
Welcome! (laughs)

18:50.762 --> 18:53.432
Wow. So, everybody feeling good?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.601
I'm pretty far
from good.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.603
Ah, my husband still thinks
I'm nuts.

18:57.669 --> 19:00.639
You know what? Follow me.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.679
SAMANTHA:
Okay, now

19:07.746 --> 19:09.915
ignite the flame, and
release the gas knob slowly.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.550
(clicking)

19:09.982 --> 19:11.550
Okay.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.452
Now hit it twice on
the side, right there.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.320
Hit it?

19:13.519 --> 19:15.320
Seriously.

19:19.458 --> 19:24.530
Okay, now turn the gas knob on,
and you'll hear a "whoomph."

19:25.531 --> 19:27.232
Nothing.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.800
Actually, a little past "on."
The calibration's off.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.270
It's been wonky for
the last 40 years or so.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.872
(whoosh)

19:32.271 --> 19:33.872
Whoa. Whoa.

19:33.939 --> 19:37.242
See? How else would
I know any of this?

19:37.309 --> 19:43.181
Okay. Well, I guess
I believe you.

19:43.248 --> 19:47.486
And... thank you.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.621
They say, "You're welcome."

19:49.688 --> 19:51.356
"They"? There's two of them?

19:52.357 --> 19:53.725
Yup.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.595
Are we done here?

19:59.464 --> 20:00.465
SAMANTHA:
Oh.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.867
All taken care of?

20:00.532 --> 20:01.867
Yup.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.303
Yup, covered the hole right up.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.705
This is not the solution.
This is worse!

20:06.772 --> 20:09.841
I demand you remedy
this posthaste!

20:09.908 --> 20:13.278
If you're here,
you're welcome.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.580
Are you starting a new article?

20:13.345 --> 20:14.580
Toying around

20:14.646 --> 20:16.782
with a book idea, actually.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.782
Ooh.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.817
Mm-mm-mm. More writey-writey,
less talky-talky.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.385
Now, where was I?

20:20.452 --> 20:22.287
You were telling me
about your wife.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.287
Huh?

20:22.354 --> 20:24.222
Oh, no. No, not you.
It's a... it's a ghost thing.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.258
All right. Well, uh, have fun.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.893
ISAAC:
Ah, yes, Beatrice.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.529
She was a handsome woman.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.464
We slept in separate bedrooms,

20:32.531 --> 20:34.933
to keep the flame
of our passion burning bright.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.336
Now, let's talk
military service.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.805
I was a beloved commander,
though I was known for

20:39.871 --> 20:40.872
riding my men hard.

20:45.944 --> 20:47.946
