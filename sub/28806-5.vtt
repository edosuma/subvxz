01:34.552 --> 01:37.347
When something dies, you bury it.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.935
If you're me, you try to
forget it ever existed.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.729
But some things just won't stay buried.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.900
Where do we start?

01:56.699 --> 01:59.410
- Jesus. How much is there?
- Eight grand.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.662
Whose blood is it?

02:01.496 --> 02:02.497
Somebody's.

02:03.206 --> 02:07.127
Sallinger has no priors. His
bank accounts are clean.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.003
He's not on social media. He's careful.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.006
But you think he's a killer?

02:12.090 --> 02:13.716
He tried to kill me.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.136
That knife in his kitchen proves it.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.513
And the way he handled it,
it was not his first time.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.182
We'll get him. He's only human.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.102
All he does is collect diplomas
and expertise in everything.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.896
- He's smarter than both of us combined.
- I don't know about that.

02:26.980 --> 02:32.360
Well, I do. We don't have a body,
a weapon, a motive, evidence.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.904
He is holding every card.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.785
Erik had no more specifics?
He just had a headache?

02:40.869 --> 02:42.787
Yeah. Shitty power.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.039
Well, it's still a power.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.459
We need to know what he does, where
he goes and who he talks to.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.669
A stakeout.

02:51.588 --> 02:56.217
Okay, you're gonna need, uh...
water, kelp juice or whatever.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.888
Hey, I've done a stakeout before.
Everything I need is in my car.

02:59.971 --> 03:00.972
Fine.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.057
You sure it wouldn't be more effective

03:03.141 --> 03:06.144
to just dangle him off the side
of a building until he confesses?

03:06.227 --> 03:08.271
- Is that what you do now?
- No.

03:09.647 --> 03:13.151
Besides, super strength
didn't come with the package.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.611
No. That would be coercion.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.820
I know that.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.071
One of his degrees is in law.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.115
Okay. I get it.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.452
Look, I just...

03:24.287 --> 03:25.955
I want to get him the right way.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.335
I don't even know what that means.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.796
Well, he's facing two superheroes now.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.677
Well, you are our one advantage.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.889
He knows me. He's studying
my moves as we speak.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.933
He doesn't know you.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.059
Nobody does.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.173
You're right.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.224
I lied.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.768
I never tried.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.398
Please.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.287
Now, that...

06:12.663 --> 06:13.956
was good work.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.047
That apartment isn't cheap.
What's Sallinger do for a living?

07:03.131 --> 07:06.134
Not much. He's a wrestling
coach at a community center,

07:06.217 --> 07:08.052
and his brother died in an accident.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.096
He's been living off the
settlement ever since.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.432
His brother died? We
should look into that.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.016
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.100
Set up here. It's a straight
shot into the apartment.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.147
I'll cover the other entrance.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.191
I can see that it's a straight shot
to the apartment. I'm right here.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.275
Okay. Whatever.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.280
You won't even allow for the possibility
that I know what I'm doing.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.198
Because you're never wrong, are you?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
You cover the front.
I'll cover the back.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.081
Just call me if you see him.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.384
Was I blind? Like,
I was blind. An idiot.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.720
I'm one of those idiot women.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.780
No, you're not.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.848
I agreed to this
ludicrous open marriage,

07:53.931 --> 07:56.100
and, like, I condone his cheating...

07:56.184 --> 07:59.437
You didn't know about the theft.
Which you will swear to in court.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.898
Like, who steals from his
dead daughter's foundation?

08:01.981 --> 08:02.982
Like, who does that?

08:04.025 --> 08:06.652
I'm losing my mind.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.779
I don't know. What do I do?

08:08.863 --> 08:09.864
Nothing.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.783
I'm gonna take care of everything. Okay?

08:14.744 --> 08:18.456
What Peter did... is reprehensible.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.917
And he will go down for it.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.838
And you will rise up.
And I will help you.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.131
I have to tell Laurent.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.636
Just when he's doing so good
in school. I mean, it's just...

08:32.720 --> 08:35.181
- It's unbearable.
- Okay. Okay. You know what?

08:35.264 --> 08:39.227
He... he is gonna get through it.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.688
He's a grown man now. Okay?

08:44.023 --> 08:46.030
It's Laurent. I asked him to come.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.090
I hope that's okay.

08:47.109 --> 08:51.531
I just don't want him to hear it
from his lying shitheel of a father.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.369
I'm gonna get my face together.
Will you let him in?

08:56.452 --> 08:57.452
Of course.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.500
- Kith!
- Peter, you're...

09:10.520 --> 09:13.052
- You're not welcome here.
- You shut up. Kith!

09:13.135 --> 09:16.514
I press this, and the building
security will race up here.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.016
Do you want to add trespassing
to your list of crimes?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.352
I didn't see it at first,
but now it is so clear.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.146
How your black soul
just seeps out of you.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.940
Poetic. Leave.

09:26.023 --> 09:29.944
Everything was fine. And you
show up, everything's ruined.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.946
That's not a coincidence. Kith!

09:32.029 --> 09:35.408
You were sleeping with your students,
stealing from your foundation,

09:35.491 --> 09:37.034
long before I arrived.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.480
Yeah, I made mistakes,
but this exposé, this...

09:39.500 --> 09:41.330
this debacle, that is all you.

09:41.410 --> 09:42.500
- You!
- Kith...

09:42.560 --> 09:45.120
No! You did this to yourself.
You disgust me.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.230
She's manipulating you.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.130
- She's trying to steal you from me.
- I don't belong to you!

09:49.213 --> 09:51.924
- And I hate your goddamn guts!
- I did those things. I did them.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.060
But I was gonna tell you!

09:53.080 --> 09:55.094
I was gonna tell you everything,
but she exposed me.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.680
- All of us! Laurent and Zoey.
- Shut up!

09:57.763 --> 09:59.974
- She destroyed your life...
- Shut up!

10:00.057 --> 10:03.436
... so you would come to her. And
look, babe! Look where you are!

10:04.103 --> 10:05.479
She made all this happen.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.067
I can't even look at you. Like...

10:10.151 --> 10:13.446
I'll never look at you again.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.531
Kith...

10:20.036 --> 10:21.245
Go home, Peter.

10:22.538 --> 10:26.167
Get a lawyer, negotiate
a reduced sentence.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.544
You'll be out in six years.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.508
You can't have her.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.012
Neither can you.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.533
At what point do you stop
having to prove yourself?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.828
To your friends? To yourself?

11:03.371 --> 11:04.955
To your dead mother who carved

11:05.039 --> 11:07.625
her expectations into your brain?

11:07.708 --> 11:10.169
Everyone needs too goddamn
much from each other.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.715
- Yeah?
- Sallinger's home.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.927
He just took something out
of his backpack. I...

11:18.552 --> 11:20.054
I think it's a photo.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.760
Yeah, I saw he had chemicals

11:21.780 --> 11:24.392
for developing film and
photographic paper.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.769
I can see it if I get on that
fire escape by his window.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.855
No. I told you he has security cameras.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.982
If he sees you, we're done.

11:33.776 --> 11:37.363
He just pulled a bureau
away from his wall.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.829
He just added the photo
to a hidden album.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.789
It could be a trophy.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.666
We have to get it.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.169
Not by breaking in. Trish?

12:02.513 --> 12:04.682
- I have a plan.
- We already have a plan.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.966
To watch him. This isn't how this works.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.394
Except when you do it, right?

12:09.353 --> 12:10.353
Let's go.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.410
Okay. You follow him.
I'll go get the photo.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.579
- God damn it!
- Just trust me for once.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.230
Yeah, I got this thing from the...

12:53.314 --> 12:54.314
- Internet.
- This is it?

12:57.151 --> 12:59.945
- The damn power's out.
- Crap. There goes the Internet.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.865
Why would the power go out?
There's no storm or anything.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.074
Yeah, I know, right?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.178
I'm on my way in.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.223
Peter Lyonne came to
my house this morning.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.227
He accused me of orchestrating
the destruction of his marriage.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.397
He'll have no proof of it.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.274
He's very upset. He...

15:01.150 --> 15:03.527
He could come to the office.
You might run into him.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.905
Will that be a problem?

15:07.281 --> 15:10.451
I was actually thinking of using,
uh, some of my vacation days.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.455
Well, everyone needs downtime.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.085
Does anyone else know what
you've been working on?

15:23.714 --> 15:27.301
As per my contract, my activities
remain between you and me.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.095
Enjoy your vacation.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.659
I know the appeal of being a loner.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.831
But for some people, it's just an act.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.961
Inside, they crave love and attention.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.814
No matter how many people have to die.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.354
Berry!

17:18.119 --> 17:19.121
Thank you.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.249
I ain't got time for your shit, Berry.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.502
Oh, my shit's got all kinds
of time for you, Gor.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.796
Get... Ow.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.715
Okay. Ow.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.642
Keep eating those candy bars,
you're gonna get your own ZIP Code.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.120
Hi, there!

18:31.276 --> 18:35.280
Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.116
- Come on. Stop it.
- Let go of me!

18:37.199 --> 18:40.160
- Stop it. Come on.
- Asshole.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.372
- God! Get off.
- I swear to God. I swear to God.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.959
- Let go of me.
- Inside.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.652
You can't keep me here.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.028
God damn it!

19:15.737 --> 19:17.865
Don't touch me!

19:17.948 --> 19:20.534
Why are you always ruining my life?

19:20.617 --> 19:22.578
You're a hooker. What am I ruining?

19:22.661 --> 19:24.288
You're a sanctimonious

19:24.371 --> 19:26.331
son of an evil prick!

19:27.541 --> 19:28.541
Don't.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.043
What the hell?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.339
Why are you here?

19:34.700 --> 19:35.740
Back at you.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.843
None of your business. That's
why you weren't invited.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.011
Nobody wanted to be invited.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.140
- Will you give it a goddamn rest?
- Screw you!

19:41.170 --> 19:44.224
You dick-swab. Destroyer!

19:46.518 --> 19:48.353
God. Jesus!

19:48.950 --> 19:50.000
Powered.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.441
- Christ. Another one?
- Who are you?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.319
- She's my sister.
- Yeah, the pleasure's all his.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.322
- Brianna, come on!
- Berry! My name is Berry!

19:59.114 --> 20:00.699
We're estranged.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.800
You couldn't tell.

20:01.825 --> 20:02.910
She's got issues.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.656
Yeah, only when I look at your face.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.121
Will you take a shower or something?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.540
- It'll calm you down.
- I don't need to calm down!

20:13.503 --> 20:14.713
You followed me.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.759
I was following your pal Sallinger.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.637
My pal? Jesus. You think...

20:21.720 --> 20:23.847
- I was trying to get Brianna...
- Berry!

20:23.931 --> 20:25.557
... someplace safe!

20:27.059 --> 20:29.269
Sallinger got to her first.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.481
What did he say to you?

20:32.564 --> 20:34.650
He wanted to know how I found him.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.733
Hi, there!

20:37.778 --> 20:38.904
You slipped up.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.366
I don't slip up. That's your MO.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.078
I just followed the broken
pieces you left behind.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.002
A smart guy wouldn't threaten
someone that can put him in prison.

20:54.086 --> 20:58.004
A smart guy would know I'll rip
his nuts out through his throat

20:58.030 --> 20:59.200
if he threatens me.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.719
You smart, asshole?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.723
You can't comprehend what I am.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.018
Then he threatened
Brianna again, saying...

21:10.102 --> 21:11.853
Your sister looks lovely.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.526
And I've been doing this a long
time. No one has ever made me.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.612
- And he did.
- Yeah, but that's why I'm here.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.407
Normally, I give Brianna
as much space as I can.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.450
She's a... She's a good person.

21:27.202 --> 21:30.956
The only person she ever hurts
is herself. And me when she can.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.457
But that's justified.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.421
You two own the room for
the next ten minutes.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.298
- I'm going back to work.
- You're not...

21:40.048 --> 21:41.758
- You're not safe.
- What?

21:42.380 --> 21:44.620
What else is new? You
dicked somebody else over,

21:44.650 --> 21:45.679
and now we all have to pay?

21:45.762 --> 21:47.556
- I'm dealing with a crazy person.
- Oh.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.016
Say that to me again.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.268
Get your things.

21:59.526 --> 22:02.404
Whatever you're not telling
me, I can feel it.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.614
I'm telling you I'm
taking a few days off.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.366
Because...

22:07.284 --> 22:08.493
I need to.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.913
Jeri rushed in three
hours late this morning

22:11.997 --> 22:13.957
and locked herself in
her office all day.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.208
Is that a coincidence?

22:15.292 --> 22:17.961
Unless she's also drinking
club soda in front of a game.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.254
So you're okay?

22:19.338 --> 22:23.091
Be better if you were here
with me. Always better.

22:23.717 --> 22:27.637
Mmm. I've got another
all-nighter with this brief.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.682
Yeah, get them billable
hours, boss lady.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.975
You better believe it.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.436
Talk tomorrow?

22:34.519 --> 22:36.938
Definitely. Love you.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.022
Love you, too.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.152
And voilà!

22:42.235 --> 22:44.279
Yes, that's the third one from the list.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.083
- There's gotta be more.
- Let's do another search.

22:47.783 --> 22:48.784
Uh...

22:49.576 --> 22:52.079
- Gillian, it's after 5:00.
- A lot after.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.538
Well, I don't pay overtime.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.100
See, I actually like Trish,

22:55.120 --> 22:57.140
so I don't need to get paid
to spend time with her.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.294
- We found something.
- It's good.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.381
Great. You guys are a team. Great.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.644
- What?
- I have a job for you.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.525
Why is it covered in blood?

23:21.608 --> 23:25.362
It may be a big job. Heroic, even.

23:26.613 --> 23:27.614
I'm on vacation.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.408
Well, then, your schedule's open.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.412
- How much is in here?
- Enough.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.122
Who is this guy?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.541
He'll keep her safe.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.585
Are you, like, a weapons guy?
You have some special skill?

23:40.669 --> 23:41.795
I trained him.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.463
And I haven't accepted the job.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.881
She's gonna eat him alive.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.860
Well, he is better looking
than most of my clients,

23:46.880 --> 23:48.385
so, yeah, I might.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.928
Okay. We're blowin' town.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.305
Will you guys stop?

23:55.308 --> 23:56.768
It's important.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.023
Okay.

24:04.150 --> 24:05.260
So what? You want to keep her safe,

24:05.280 --> 24:07.237
you want to keep her close by because...

24:07.320 --> 24:08.613
you're her brother.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.948
That's too easy. We look alike.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.951
You look nothing alike. But you
are protective of her 'cause,

24:13.030 --> 24:15.240
well, clearly she makes
bad choices for herself

24:15.260 --> 24:16.496
and won't let you help.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.540
You're looking less hot by the second.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.380
And you're obviously not her boyfriend,

24:20.400 --> 24:22.480
because... you're bangin' Jessica.

24:22.502 --> 24:25.130
That's actu... No, you're
wrong about that part.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.423
No, I don't trust him.

24:26.506 --> 24:29.342
Great. Good enough for me. Hi.

24:29.426 --> 24:30.427
Hi.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.624
I'll just need specifics, like
who I'm protecting her from.

24:35.765 --> 24:36.766
Hey.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.895
This guy's giving me a headache.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.939
- Hi, Malcolm Ducasse.
- Malcolm?

24:43.023 --> 24:44.816
- Berry.
- Ah...

24:45.609 --> 24:46.610
No way.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.947
Scale of one to ten?

24:52.282 --> 24:53.533
Maybe a three.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.789
I'm gonna trust my gut over
your head. Give me a second.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.146
What do ya got?

25:23.230 --> 25:24.564
Sallinger's victims.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.858
Four of them are in the Online
Missing Persons Database.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.777
But it's a good bet all
of them are missing.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.904
The disappearances span ten years.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.864
And those are just the
ones we know about.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.742
So he's a serial killer.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.207
Can I use your shower?

25:45.961 --> 25:49.339
- My hotel shower is communal.
- Ew.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.801
Sure. Knock yourself out.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.929
I'll call the cops.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.264
And say what?

25:57.347 --> 25:59.057
"Hello. We found a serial killer."

26:00.220 --> 26:04.880
We found a guy who gives Erik headaches

26:04.900 --> 26:07.440
and photos that we obtained illegally.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.238
Where are you going?

26:13.321 --> 26:16.157
To beat the shit out of
Sallinger until he confesses.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.409
Oh, Jesus Christ.

26:17.492 --> 26:20.662
You know what, Jess? You do it
your way, I'm gonna do it my way.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.498
Do you think I don't want to
beat the shit out of Sallinger?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.126
Of course I do. But I'm not an idiot.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.753
You know what, Jess? Y...

26:32.924 --> 26:33.924
What?

26:39.431 --> 26:40.431
Forget it.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.642
- Fine.
- Fine.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.773
God forbid you actually talk about it.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.276
- Jess doesn't talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.

26:56.781 --> 26:59.075
I'm sick of people throwing
away friends and family

26:59.159 --> 27:00.952
like there's plenty more
where that came from.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.120
There isn't.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.957
Work it out.

27:20.013 --> 27:22.140
- Have you seen this?
- Seen what?

27:22.223 --> 27:23.558
Oh, shit.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.397
Peter Lyonne... He... he posted this.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.442
I betrayed my family.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.196
Especially the memory
of my beloved daughter.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.617
I can't take that back.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.619
I would have tried to make it right,

27:43.660 --> 27:46.640
but an unethical attorney
named Jeryn Hogarth

27:46.660 --> 27:48.249
never gave me the chance.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.752
She disregarded due process,

27:51.294 --> 27:54.714
and she exposed my transgressions,
and now I must return the favor.

27:54.798 --> 27:55.924
Oh, shit.

27:56.716 --> 28:00.178
I have been studying a new and
very treacherous legal specialty.

28:00.261 --> 28:03.765
The defense of the superhuman vigilante.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.976
Jeryn Hogarth...

28:08.228 --> 28:12.065
and her firm are leading this charge.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.026
Hence, these powered felons
are at her beck and call.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.029
- That is slander.
- It doesn't matter.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.740
I don't have Jessica at my beck

28:19.760 --> 28:22.200
- and call.
- I know. Just watch.

28:22.283 --> 28:27.664
Her clients have been accused of
assault, of murder, of much more.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.125
Yet Jeryn Hogarth sees to it

28:30.208 --> 28:34.462
that these super criminals still
continue to walk our streets.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.387
Oh, my God.

28:42.470 --> 28:46.182
Please listen. Every single one of us,

28:46.891 --> 28:50.687
the entire fabric of our
legal system, is at risk.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.274
I can't fight this fight.

28:55.442 --> 28:56.776
It's too late for me.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.406
Oh, God. I beg you, somebody, stop her.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.496
Kith...

29:10.081 --> 29:11.124
Laurent...

29:11.750 --> 29:12.959
I'm so...

29:13.042 --> 29:14.544
I'm so sorry.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.259
Police found him dead in his bathtub.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.553
They want to talk to you.

29:23.636 --> 29:24.637
Yeah.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.062
Hello, this is Kith.
Please leave a message.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.814
We need to get ahead of this.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.983
Jeri, I think that you should...

29:37.776 --> 29:40.236
... stay!

29:40.320 --> 29:42.030
Shit.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.785
You don't treat me like an equal.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.578
Well, you don't act like an equal.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.664
How would you know? You won't
give me the chance to prove it.

29:52.457 --> 29:56.795
Because I have seen what happens
when you try and prove something.

29:56.878 --> 30:00.340
Oh, for God's sake. Could
you please let it go?

30:06.179 --> 30:08.598
"Let it go"?

30:08.681 --> 30:11.893
Yes. It's time.

30:13.394 --> 30:15.939
It is time for you to get
your head out of your ass

30:16.022 --> 30:17.315
and admit that you were wrong.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.983
I wasn't wrong.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.447
You murdered my mother.

30:24.530 --> 30:27.000
Who murdered a lot of other people.

30:27.030 --> 30:28.952
Who might have eventually killed you.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.703
Why can't you admit that?

30:33.748 --> 30:35.291
Because I had her back.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.384
I had someone.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.351
Well, you've always had someone, Jess.

31:14.831 --> 31:15.874
Family...

31:34.893 --> 31:36.394
You want to talk about it?

31:44.485 --> 31:46.029
Actually, I'd like to forget.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.508
Kith?

32:12.805 --> 32:14.307
Hey, Kith!

32:33.368 --> 32:36.621
Hey. It's me. I, uh...

32:38.915 --> 32:42.919
I just... I just saw...

32:44.379 --> 32:45.755
Oh, my God, uh...

32:48.591 --> 32:49.842
Are you okay?

32:52.178 --> 32:54.138
Stay away from me.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.578
Hey.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.665
You here?

33:26.254 --> 33:27.839
Did I take your mind off it?

33:29.007 --> 33:30.008
No.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.385
You're lying.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.887
Pretty confident, aren't you?

33:34.970 --> 33:38.840
Actually, I get kind of the
opposite of a migraine

33:38.860 --> 33:40.400
when I make a woman...

33:41.019 --> 33:42.019
happy.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.272
It's a big incentive.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.400
I'm busy trying to figure out

33:53.420 --> 33:56.367
how to get rid of eight
bodies in a crowded city.

33:56.451 --> 34:00.038
You bury them, burn them...

34:01.622 --> 34:04.542
Mmm, dissolve 'em in
acid? I don't know...

34:05.418 --> 34:07.587
You chop 'em up?

34:08.170 --> 34:09.422
That would be the one.

34:10.505 --> 34:12.300
And I would need a handsaw.

34:14.469 --> 34:18.014
When I was there, it was gone.
And later, it was back.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.639
Well, he was using it.

34:19.719 --> 34:21.480
There might be trace evidence on it.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.893
Maybe it'll lead me to something.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.103
I just...

34:28.565 --> 34:30.818
I don't get why you're
obligated to do this.

34:31.230 --> 34:32.659
Because I'm the one that found him

34:32.690 --> 34:34.030
and I'm the one that knows what he is.

34:34.112 --> 34:36.908
Well, technically, I found him.
None of this is on you.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.576
Except he's a serial killer.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.746
The quintessential bad guy.

34:42.455 --> 34:46.083
And... And you're the
quintessential hero?

34:48.335 --> 34:49.420
Not even close.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.255
You don't like the word?

34:53.007 --> 34:55.009
There's no proof that it applies.

34:57.094 --> 35:00.181
Well, suppose I should help you.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.767
Forget it. I won't be
able to protect you.

35:02.850 --> 35:06.521
Wow. Good thing I just proved
my masculinity all night.

35:06.604 --> 35:07.855
You think you did.

35:08.564 --> 35:09.565
I know.

35:12.735 --> 35:15.613
Feel free to leave me one of
those burgers before you go.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.785
Mmm.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.047
He's sleeping.

35:33.881 --> 35:34.924
I'll take the street.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.342
Wait.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.223
Spot the difference?

35:46.352 --> 35:47.812
The saw.

35:47.895 --> 35:50.335
It's hard to move eight bodies
unless they're in small pieces.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.611
That gels with something
I've been thinking about.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.616
Vacuum-seal bags.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.420
We sell them on ARN. They're for storing

36:04.457 --> 36:07.039
and preserving clothes, bedding...

36:07.123 --> 36:08.374
Body parts.

36:08.457 --> 36:09.709
Christ.

36:10.751 --> 36:14.213
And all we can do is wait and hope
he eventually leads us to them.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.339
He won't.

36:16.424 --> 36:20.761
But I have a potentially
vomit-inducing idea.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.597
- Go for it.
- I need you.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.434
To kick some ass?

36:26.517 --> 36:29.145
To visit your old pal at the morgue.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.229
Maury.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.983
We need to borrow something.

36:36.944 --> 36:40.031
I just can't believe he did it.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.240
Nobody can.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.202
Phones are ringing off the hook.
Clients are dropping us.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.870
We're hemorrhaging over here.

36:45.953 --> 36:48.164
He just got pushed too far, you know?

36:49.957 --> 36:52.835
Peter Lyonne? Did you know him?

36:56.214 --> 36:58.174
Did you have something to do with this?

36:59.342 --> 37:00.509
I'm not sure.

37:01.427 --> 37:02.553
Baby, Lyonne made a choice.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.931
He made a lot of choices.
They collapsed in on him.

37:05.010 --> 37:06.300
Yeah, you don't even know...

37:06.330 --> 37:09.435
And I don't need to. Because I know you.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.687
I know you didn't make
him take his own life.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.753
You didn't make him spew lies and hate

37:13.780 --> 37:15.280
with his last dying breath either.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.152
He did that. Do you
understand? He did that.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.154
Zaya! I have Henriksson on two!

37:21.697 --> 37:24.325
I... I really wish I could
be there with you tonight,

37:24.408 --> 37:26.953
but it's gonna be a long one over here.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.120
Shit!

37:31.040 --> 37:32.416
It's okay, babe. I'm...

37:33.042 --> 37:35.086
- Shit!
- ... keeping busy.

37:35.753 --> 37:36.796
See you later.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.512
Oh, God.

37:47.890 --> 37:50.977
Shit! Shit!

37:51.519 --> 37:52.561
Shit.

37:53.729 --> 37:54.897
Can I help you?

37:55.523 --> 37:58.609
Yeah, I can't find my,
um, palm-tree earring.

38:08.619 --> 38:09.870
You mean this?

38:11.539 --> 38:12.581
Jesus!

38:13.124 --> 38:16.377
Have you got your meds on you?
What is it? Haldol? Loxitane?

38:16.460 --> 38:18.520
Why? You want some? I
could use the cash.

38:18.550 --> 38:20.140
You could use to take them.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.134
I like me as me.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.052
Okay, what... what are you doing?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.096
Go back to your phone sex
with the girlfriend.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.514
I'm bored to shit.

38:28.597 --> 38:31.058
I wasn't having phone sex.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.893
Oh, okay, that's my ride.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.603
What? Wait.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.315
- Wait!
- What?

38:41.068 --> 38:43.195
No. That guy is nobody's ride. Sit.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.698
Gor, is that you?

38:45.781 --> 38:47.575
Open the damn door, Berry.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.118
- Hi.
- Let's go, Berry.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.202
Okay.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.622
Who is this guy?

38:53.670 --> 38:54.680
It's my boss.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.292
Your pimp? You called your pimp?

38:56.375 --> 38:58.878
- Mama's gotta work.
- I ain't got all day.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.921
- Okay.
- Forget it.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.090
- "Forget it"?
- Thank you.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.010
If you go back out on the
street, you are an easy target.

39:06.093 --> 39:08.220
- I protect my own women.
- See?

39:08.304 --> 39:11.015
Can we talk this out before you just...

39:13.225 --> 39:14.977
For shit's sake, Gor!

39:15.811 --> 39:17.688
He's fine.

39:19.815 --> 39:20.858
Sorry.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.486
You're such an asshole.

40:28.384 --> 40:29.969
Do I know you?

41:08.757 --> 41:10.468
911. What's your emergency?

41:49.507 --> 41:50.925
Can we help you, ma'am?

41:51.717 --> 41:54.345
I'm just enjoying the night.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.722
We received a loitering complaint.

42:10.486 --> 42:11.904
Have you been drinking, ma'am?

42:17.660 --> 42:20.162
Nah, I'm just tired.
I'm gonna head home.

42:20.246 --> 42:21.726
I think that's a good idea.

42:44.603 --> 42:45.688
He went that way.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.070
Hey, turn that off.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.865
I didn't get super strength,
but I can see in the dark.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.409
That's where he hides them.

43:41.660 --> 43:42.911
We don't know that.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.581
I want proof before you blow your cover.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.386
I'm gonna check the tank.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.222
I'll stay with Sallinger. Flag
me if the bodies are there.

44:07.519 --> 44:08.687
Don't lose him.

45:14.461 --> 45:15.504
Shit.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.521
Holy shit.

45:33.313 --> 45:34.313
Shit.

47:10.619 --> 47:11.912
She has thirty seconds.

47:13.330 --> 47:16.208
Twenty-nine... 28...

47:51.994 --> 47:53.871
Jess!

47:54.913 --> 47:57.124
- I'm coming down.
- No.

47:58.917 --> 48:00.168
Give me your hand.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.504
Did you lose him?

48:03.630 --> 48:04.965
I chose you.

48:18.604 --> 48:19.813
He's still out there.

48:20.772 --> 48:22.357
Yeah, but I get to breathe.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.193
I'm still alive.

48:27.529 --> 48:28.614
Thanks.

48:34.995 --> 48:37.122
Uh, I wish...

48:41.335 --> 48:43.128
I wish I didn't kill your mom.

49:03.190 --> 49:05.317
I wish she wasn't a mass murderer.

49:11.114 --> 49:13.367
Oh, shit, they're coming. You gotta go.

49:13.450 --> 49:15.702
- What about my statement?
- We need your anonymity.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.290
We'll get him.

49:21.700 --> 49:22.751
Good tagline.
