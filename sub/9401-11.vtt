WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.847
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is I don't have a job.

00:02.847 --> 00:04.478
I asked you to do two things for me...

00:04.846 --> 00:06.221
make sure I play for the Bobcats

00:06.221 --> 00:08.134
and stay away from Quinn. You're fired.

00:08.134 --> 00:10.736
Maybe something went wrong
because Clay got careless.

00:10.860 --> 00:11.538
You mean with me?

00:11.538 --> 00:13.336
If that's what he got fired for,

00:13.336 --> 00:15.481
Then I'm happy he's not
in Nathan's life anymore.

00:15.481 --> 00:17.765
All right, so there's this
sports-coordination company

00:17.765 --> 00:19.521
called Sportsarc...
they want to talk to you.

00:19.521 --> 00:20.623
That's good looking out.

00:20.623 --> 00:22.435
We do a live broadcast.

00:22.894 --> 00:24.429
From the hallway where
I murdered my brother?

00:25.283 --> 00:26.793
Where one of your
classmates committed suicide?

00:26.793 --> 00:28.749
It's not happening for the script.

00:28.749 --> 00:30.072
So it's really over?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.673
Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:33.128 --> 00:35.501
It's Millicent. I got
arrested, and I need your help.

00:35.501 --> 00:36.893
I can't help you.

00:37.319 --> 00:39.513
I am sorry, but the
test came back negative.

00:39.513 --> 00:41.838
You can't have children?
They told you that?

00:41.838 --> 00:43.232
I'm sorry.

00:44.029 --> 00:44.712
Brooke.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.901
You're kind of nicely dressed
for a guy who just got fired.

01:10.968 --> 01:13.000
Well, an agent should wear a suit.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.234
Plus, I don't want to get drowned again.

01:16.767 --> 01:18.029
So which clients are staying with you?

01:18.029 --> 01:20.356
None. ISC got to everyone.

01:20.356 --> 01:21.961
Every single one?

01:21.961 --> 01:23.071
Everyone they know about.

01:23.071 --> 01:25.046
But there is a kid in Arkansas

01:25.046 --> 01:26.928
that agreed to sign
with me not too long ago.

01:26.928 --> 01:29.601
They don't know about him.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.824
And there's a little secret
that only I know about him.

01:32.824 --> 01:34.136
And what's that?

01:34.136 --> 01:37.589
In four years, he is gonna be
the best quarterback in the NFL.

01:37.589 --> 01:39.712
That's so great.

01:42.351 --> 01:43.479
You can do this.

01:45.076 --> 01:46.001
I'm so proud of you.

01:49.824 --> 01:50.561
Thanks.

01:50.561 --> 01:52.241
That means a lot.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.064
It means everything, actually.

01:58.483 --> 01:59.970
Great. Yeah, I'll see you in a few.

01:59.970 --> 02:00.903
Thanks.

02:01.738 --> 02:04.370
That was the agency. They
got an offer coming in.

02:04.370 --> 02:05.850
That's good news. From where?

02:05.850 --> 02:07.702
Actually, I'm not sure,

02:07.702 --> 02:09.253
but they're on their way
over now to fill us in.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.164
It sounded good, though, right?

02:11.164 --> 02:13.231
I'll be playing in the NBA.

02:13.231 --> 02:14.781
That's all that matters.

02:14.781 --> 02:16.256
Ohh!

02:21.791 --> 02:24.539
So, I was thinking about
taking some time off from...

02:24.539 --> 02:28.431
well, doing nothing.

02:28.431 --> 02:30.458
How'd you like to
spend some quality time

02:30.458 --> 02:31.401
with your boyfriend?

02:31.401 --> 02:32.863
I can't.

02:33.513 --> 02:35.085
Oh, come on.

02:35.085 --> 02:36.146
No really.

02:36.146 --> 02:37.605
I need to go talk to Millicent.

02:37.605 --> 02:40.027
I am so pissed at her, so pissed that...

02:40.027 --> 02:41.871
That you're gonna go over
and check that she's okay?

02:44.141 --> 02:45.002
Yeah.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.000
Love my girl.

02:53.868 --> 02:55.234
Hey.

02:57.033 --> 03:00.167
I don't need kids to make me happy.

03:00.234 --> 03:02.167
I just need you, Brooke Davis.

03:05.234 --> 03:07.667
What did I do to deserve you?

03:15.434 --> 03:17.267
Okay, sizzle reel?

03:17.334 --> 03:19.801
Yeah, you know, "sizzle" like "hot."

03:19.868 --> 03:21.400
It's kind of like a highlight reel

03:21.467 --> 03:23.434
that I can use to show
the company in Los Angeles

03:23.501 --> 03:25.000
that I can actually do this job.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.767
And Julian said if I turn in a
good reel, then they'll hire me.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.968
I just don't know what to shoot.

03:30.033 --> 03:31.501
You should get these guys.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.258
"White men can't
jump." It's my favorite.

03:33.258 --> 03:35.934
These guys are awesome.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.825
Someday, I want to play just like them.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.822
So, what are you and
chuck doin' this afternoon?

03:51.971 --> 03:53.129
Hold that thought.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.900
- Hey, Brooke, what's up?
- Hey

03:59.588 --> 04:01.467
Where's Millie?

04:00.817 --> 04:04.300
I don't know. She didn't
come home last night.

04:04.367 --> 04:05.934
You don't know?

04:06.033 --> 04:08.167
Know what?

04:08.234 --> 04:11.098
Millie got arrested for
drunk driving last night.

04:11.474 --> 04:13.662
I'm sorry, I thought
you would have heard.

04:13.662 --> 04:14.255
I'll call you.

04:22.291 --> 04:22.838
Oh!

04:23.567 --> 04:26.139
Victoria? What are you doing here?

04:26.139 --> 04:29.095
Right now? Having second thoughts.

04:31.977 --> 04:32.841
Did you just bail me out?

04:32.841 --> 04:34.400
A simple "thank you" will suffice.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.814
And now, if you're quite
finished with your star turn

04:37.814 --> 04:39.208
in "the slutshank redemption,"

04:39.208 --> 04:41.760
- I think we'll be on our way.
- I'm so sorry, victoria.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.254
Please save the gratitude
for someone who cares.

04:43.254 --> 04:44.680
I'm just protecting our investment.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.655
Zero may not be a size,
but it's clearly your I.Q.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.487
Now get yourself home,

04:49.487 --> 04:51.986
clean yourself up, and whatever you do,

04:51.986 --> 04:53.587
don't show your face
at Clothes Over Bros

04:53.587 --> 04:55.675
until you're ready to
act like a professional.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.334
So what you have to understand

05:09.401 --> 05:12.967
is that right now every
NBA team has a full roster,

05:13.034 --> 05:14.534
and most are capped out.

05:14.601 --> 05:16.467
So, what do you guys propose?

05:16.534 --> 05:18.334
Regal Barcelona.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.467
Spain?

05:20.534 --> 05:22.134
I already turned down a European offer.

05:22.201 --> 05:23.700
The timing's different now.

05:23.767 --> 05:26.501
We could probably get you
the league minimum somewhere,

05:26.568 --> 05:29.100
but that's gonna hurt your
profile in the long run.

05:29.167 --> 05:31.634
Barcelona is a good get.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.733
You see, the trick right now

05:33.800 --> 05:36.167
is making sure your quote stays up

05:36.234 --> 05:39.467
and keeping you viable now
that the Bobcat deal is dead.

05:39.534 --> 05:42.534
Barcelona does both those things.

05:42.601 --> 05:44.934
But he wants to play in the NBA.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.501
And he will. Nate, you
got to trust us on this.

05:47.568 --> 05:51.100
Take the family to
Spain, work on your game,

05:51.167 --> 05:54.668
and next year, we'll
have you back in the NBA.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.465
Bright and early, as discussed.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.672
Very commendable, Haley James Scott.

06:12.301 --> 06:13.709
Our "accidental release" of your track

06:13.709 --> 06:14.968
just went viral on the net.

06:15.127 --> 06:17.075
Your fans are eating it
up like christmas trifle.

06:17.075 --> 06:18.687
We have to finish this album.

06:18.687 --> 06:19.906
Yeah, about that...

06:19.906 --> 06:21.926
um, how do you feel

06:21.926 --> 06:24.591
about me finishing the
remaining tracks in Spain?

06:24.591 --> 06:27.337
Do you understand what's
happening right now?

06:27.337 --> 06:28.718
This is lightning in a bottle.

06:28.718 --> 06:30.701
It's been years since
your last album, Haley,

06:30.701 --> 06:31.308
and you have momentum again.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.479
We have to capitalize on that.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.966
- Nathan got a job offer in Spain.
- Good.

06:34.966 --> 06:37.164
Then you can send him a copy
of the album when we finish.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.596
I'm serious, Miranda.

06:38.596 --> 06:40.994
He's worked really hard
for this. It's his dream.

06:40.994 --> 06:43.166
And what about your dream?

06:43.166 --> 06:45.917
Maybe it can wait a little longer.

06:45.917 --> 06:48.365
Well, this says it can't.

06:48.365 --> 06:52.744
That's a ticket to the
starttart of your tour

06:52.744 --> 06:54.853
in advance support of
your new smash album.

06:54.853 --> 06:56.319
You ship out next week.

06:56.319 --> 06:58.437
Not to do so would be a
violation of your contract.

06:58.437 --> 07:00.527
Well, I'm not sure I
can do this, Miranda.

07:00.527 --> 07:03.880
Well, the survival of
this label depends on it,

07:03.880 --> 07:06.277
so you better get sure.

07:13.956 --> 07:15.850
Millie, this is like the fourth
time I've called. Where...

07:28.201 --> 07:29.099
I'm glad you're okay.

07:31.834 --> 07:34.534
But all of this needs to stop.

07:34.601 --> 07:36.701
I need you to figure that out.

07:36.768 --> 07:39.467
And I'm really afraid
of what might happen

07:39.534 --> 07:42.834
if you don't figure it out, because...

07:42.900 --> 07:45.134
I miss the old Millie.

07:46.367 --> 07:48.200
I miss the Millie

07:48.267 --> 07:50.467
that would rather stay
in and play video games

07:50.534 --> 07:52.634
than stay out all night without calling.

07:52.701 --> 07:55.534
I miss the Millie who
cared about her real friends

07:55.601 --> 07:57.367
and worked hard at her job.

07:57.434 --> 07:59.200
I miss that Millie.

08:01.234 --> 08:03.467
I want her back.

08:13.434 --> 08:16.114
I still love you, Millicent.

08:39.234 --> 08:41.100
I'm sorry I said "I love you."

08:43.467 --> 08:44.900
It's okay.

08:47.067 --> 08:48.667
Come in.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.434
Fact is, I'm sorry about a lot of things

08:54.501 --> 08:56.401
I've done these days.

08:56.467 --> 08:59.200
I know I drive everyone crazy,

08:59.267 --> 09:02.200
and Brooke must hate me right now.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.601
It's hard because I...

09:04.667 --> 09:06.601
I just thought that...

09:06.667 --> 09:08.567
You thought what?

09:08.634 --> 09:11.134
I thought we would be doing
this great thing, you know?

09:11.200 --> 09:14.601
And now it's all over
before it even started.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.601
Hey, I loved the script, too,

09:16.667 --> 09:19.401
but there will be other
scripts, other projects.

09:19.467 --> 09:20.900
You think so?

09:20.967 --> 09:22.701
I know so. You're talented.

09:22.768 --> 09:24.967
The important thing is to
just keep moving forward.

09:25.033 --> 09:26.634
I mean, you know how Hollywood works.

09:26.701 --> 09:27.834
It has nothing to do with you.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.267
You always make me feel better.

09:31.334 --> 09:33.300
It'll be okay, I promise.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.501
Besides, I kind of need
to spend some quality time

09:35.567 --> 09:36.734
with Brooke right now.

09:36.801 --> 09:38.534
Is everything okay?

09:38.601 --> 09:41.134
It will be eventually. It's just...

09:41.200 --> 09:43.534
Just what? Please don't
tell me it's because of me.

09:43.601 --> 09:45.401
No. No, it's nothing like that.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.033
It is. You're mad at me. I can tell.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.667
No, Alex, it's just...

09:49.734 --> 09:50.900
Just forget it.

09:50.967 --> 09:52.367
Fine. It's obviously about me,

09:52.434 --> 09:53.834
'cause if it wasn't, you'd tell me.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.401
We found out Brooke can't get pregnant.

09:55.467 --> 09:56.933
She can't have kids.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.734
Oh, my God.

09:58.801 --> 10:02.768
You must... she must be devastated.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.634
Is there anything I can do to help?

10:04.701 --> 10:06.367
No.

10:06.434 --> 10:08.801
God, I shouldn't even have told you.

10:10.434 --> 10:12.834
So, please, let's just
keep it between us, okay?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.134
Sure.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.434
You know, to be honest,

10:16.501 --> 10:19.367
I didn't even know I wanted to have kids

10:19.434 --> 10:22.834
until the moment I found
out I might not be able to.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.768
It's so sad.

10:25.834 --> 10:29.567
You would have been such a great dad.

10:29.634 --> 10:31.033
I'm sorry.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.100
Okay.

11:05.167 --> 11:06.567
All right.

11:06.634 --> 11:08.534
Nothing riding on this...

11:08.601 --> 11:10.401
just your whole career.

11:10.467 --> 11:13.167
But you've done this thousands of times.

11:13.234 --> 11:15.167
Kid with a big dream
wants to see it happen,

11:15.234 --> 11:16.701
you make it happen.

11:16.768 --> 11:18.567
You are the dream merchant.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.567
And you are back.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.967
Huh.

11:26.033 --> 11:29.000
Excuse me, I... I seem
to have gotten lost.

11:29.067 --> 11:31.367
I'm actually looking for the
next hot NFL Q.B. Prospect.

11:31.434 --> 11:32.768
I was wondering if you
could possibly point me

11:32.834 --> 11:33.834
in the right direction?

11:33.900 --> 11:35.734
Mr. Evans. It's good to see you.

11:35.801 --> 11:37.167
Yeah, likewise. How you been, man?

11:37.234 --> 11:39.267
Good. You doin' all right?

11:44.601 --> 11:45.701
Penny for your thoughts.

11:45.768 --> 11:47.000
Are you sure about that?

11:47.067 --> 11:49.067
Might want your money
back after you hear 'em.

11:49.134 --> 11:50.734
Try me.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.401
I think we should go to Spain.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.501
I've been wrestling with it all morning,

11:58.567 --> 12:00.933
and in the end, I think Ken is right.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.401
If I sit out a year, I may
never make it back to the NBA.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.267
Spain keeps me viable.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.267
Spain assures that I will make it back.

12:09.334 --> 12:11.768
There's no other option?

12:11.834 --> 12:13.367
No.

12:13.434 --> 12:15.734
And, look, I know that it's not ideal,

12:15.801 --> 12:17.967
but it makes sense.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.534
And it's only for a year.

12:19.601 --> 12:20.933
At least we'll be together.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.701
Yeah.

12:22.768 --> 12:24.667
What? What's wrong?

12:24.734 --> 12:26.768
The record company wants me to tour

12:26.834 --> 12:29.567
in support of my new album.

12:29.634 --> 12:32.768
I'm supposed to leave next week.

12:36.501 --> 12:38.194
Wow.

12:47.368 --> 12:50.101
Game ball from the conference
championships, right?

12:50.167 --> 12:51.700
Right.

12:51.767 --> 12:53.001
Yeah.

12:53.067 --> 12:55.900
That... that was a great game.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.700
What did you pass for?

12:57.767 --> 12:59.834
400 yards.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.567
It was 428 and 5 touchdowns,

13:02.633 --> 13:04.967
but who's counting, right?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.767
You don't miss anything, do you?

13:06.834 --> 13:09.067
It's my job not to miss.

13:09.134 --> 13:11.368
And I promise you that I won't with you.

13:11.434 --> 13:12.800
All right, troy?

13:12.867 --> 13:14.900
I will do everything that I
can to get you the best deal,

13:14.967 --> 13:16.468
the best endorsements.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.267
I know, but...

13:21.101 --> 13:22.468
What's going on, Troy?

13:22.533 --> 13:26.600
Ken Arthur called my dad two days ago.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.267
He said they fired you.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.834
I'm Dan Scott, and I've
shown people the world over

13:34.900 --> 13:36.101
how to rebuild their lives

13:36.167 --> 13:37.667
through the power of forgiveness.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.167
But what about me?

13:39.234 --> 13:40.734
Can I be forgiven?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.900
Tune in tomorrow for
a very special edition

13:42.967 --> 13:44.500
of "Scott free: redemption."

13:44.567 --> 13:46.834
And remember... the
truth will set you free.

13:46.900 --> 13:47.900
Cut!

13:49.934 --> 13:53.167
That was good, but I
think you can go bigger.

13:53.234 --> 13:54.834
You don't think it's already too big?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.667
Too big? No, it's genius.

13:56.734 --> 13:59.334
It'll take us to a whole other level.

13:59.401 --> 14:02.930
Everyone, back to
one. We're going again.

14:09.534 --> 14:10.767
Millie?

14:10.834 --> 14:12.067
Oh, my God, are you okay?

14:12.133 --> 14:13.534
I'm fine.

14:13.601 --> 14:14.901
Was last night terrible or what?

14:14.968 --> 14:16.467
It is what it is. I said I'm fine.

14:18.601 --> 14:20.133
Have you seen my 7's?

14:20.200 --> 14:21.834
No.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.033
Are these what you're looking for?

14:29.100 --> 14:30.300
Yes!

14:30.367 --> 14:33.467
Can I have my jeans, please?

14:33.534 --> 14:35.434
Or is this what you're after?

14:36.434 --> 14:38.067
Alex!

14:38.133 --> 14:39.033
That's mine.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.467
Alex, don't!

14:40.534 --> 14:41.567
- Don't!
- Millie.

14:41.634 --> 14:43.334
No! No!

14:46.901 --> 14:49.501
You did not just do that.

14:49.567 --> 14:52.133
Millie, you have to stop.
I've been there, trust me.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.634
How dare you? I thought
you were my friend.

14:54.701 --> 14:56.801
I am. Millie, you can't see it now,

14:56.868 --> 14:58.367
but I know what I'm doing.

14:58.434 --> 14:59.501
You don't.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.934
You think you're better than me?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.434
Well, you're not.

15:03.501 --> 15:05.033
You're just some washed-up actress

15:05.100 --> 15:07.400
that's too dumb to realize
she's chasing after a boy

15:07.467 --> 15:08.834
that has no interest in her.

15:08.901 --> 15:12.634
And if you had half a
brain, you'd understand that.

15:12.701 --> 15:16.000
Julian doesn't want you in his life,

15:16.067 --> 15:17.868
and neither do I.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.133
You're coming with me.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.701
I thought we were in a fight.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.801
Well, right now we're taking a time-out

15:30.868 --> 15:32.334
'cause I need my big sister.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.901
Okay.

15:44.367 --> 15:47.868
This farm's been in my
family for five generations.

15:47.934 --> 15:49.834
It's nice.

15:49.901 --> 15:51.601
Yeah.

15:51.667 --> 15:52.934
But how much longer

15:53.000 --> 15:55.067
do you think my dad can
really work this place?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.467
There's a lot riding on me right now.

15:59.534 --> 16:02.067
Hell, I stand to make
more money in the next year

16:02.133 --> 16:04.400
than my dad made in his whole life.

16:04.467 --> 16:07.067
But I have one shot at this.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.634
My family has one shot at this.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.701
It's everything.

16:11.234 --> 16:12.701
I like you, Clay.

16:12.767 --> 16:16.000
And I know that I
said I'd sign with you.

16:16.067 --> 16:18.634
But you're an agent without an agency.

16:18.701 --> 16:20.767
And this is my whole life.

16:23.501 --> 16:27.234
If you were me, what would you do?

16:30.234 --> 16:33.467
Who did Ken Arthur tell you
he was gonna pair you up with?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.767
Mark Wetton.

16:35.834 --> 16:38.501
Well...

16:38.567 --> 16:40.601
I'd go with Jim Mitchel.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.300
He'll make a better fit.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.868
And, uh...

16:49.734 --> 16:52.234
I'll be seeing you around.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.834
If you're looking for
your partner in crime,

17:05.901 --> 17:08.099
you might want to try central booking.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.099
That's not why I'm here.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.968
I know what you're going through.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.733
My sister went through it, too.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.666
Of course, she was a lot older than you.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.367
Julian told you?

17:20.434 --> 17:22.666
I can't believe this is happening.

17:22.733 --> 17:25.000
Yeah, he did, but don't
hate on him for that.

17:25.067 --> 17:27.133
It's just we talk about everything,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.868
and he told me how much
he wanted to have kids.

17:29.934 --> 17:32.734
So the important thing is
that we get you some help.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.801
We?

17:33.868 --> 17:35.734
We who?

17:35.801 --> 17:37.234
You and Julian?

17:37.300 --> 17:38.334
Yeah.

17:39.868 --> 17:42.167
Well, since the two of
you talk about everything,

17:42.234 --> 17:44.689
I'm sure he finally told you
the real reason your script died.

17:44.901 --> 17:47.300
What real reason?

17:47.367 --> 17:48.734
Oh...

17:48.801 --> 17:52.901
His dad had said that it was
unmakeable with you attached.

17:52.968 --> 17:55.334
You are the reason the project is dead.

17:56.501 --> 17:58.634
No. No, that's not true.

17:58.701 --> 17:59.868
It is true.

17:59.934 --> 18:02.100
Maybe you should ask Julian about that

18:02.167 --> 18:03.934
next time you talk about everything.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.434
Get out of my store.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.167
You know, I really need you right now.

18:45.234 --> 18:47.600
It's not fair to hide in my dreams

18:47.667 --> 18:49.800
and not be here when
I need you the most.

18:52.134 --> 18:55.301
Talk to me, Sara.

19:07.534 --> 19:08.700
Jamie's not here.

19:08.767 --> 19:10.367
I'm not here to see Jamie.

19:10.434 --> 19:12.067
Then what do you want?

19:12.134 --> 19:14.067
I want you to know before it gets out

19:14.134 --> 19:15.831
that I plan on doing a show
about the day we lost Keith.

19:15.831 --> 19:17.438
You mean the day you killed Keith.

19:17.438 --> 19:20.196
If you're gonna ask for
forgiveness, get it right, Dan.

19:20.196 --> 19:21.946
I don't expect you to be okay with it.

19:21.946 --> 19:23.203
Just try to keep an open mind.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.072
This show is about helping people.

19:25.072 --> 19:26.081
No, no, it's not.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.516
You know what I see when I watch it?

19:28.667 --> 19:29.934
I see a lot of miserable people

19:30.001 --> 19:31.167
and you taking their money.

19:31.234 --> 19:32.434
Just try to give it a chance.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.800
A chance?

19:34.867 --> 19:36.267
You think after all these years,

19:36.334 --> 19:38.234
I didn't want to believe
that you're a better father

19:38.301 --> 19:39.867
than the man standing in front of me?

19:39.934 --> 19:41.900
I've given you a million chances.

19:41.967 --> 19:44.101
And the fact is, if you
ever really helped anyone,

19:44.167 --> 19:45.500
if you did just one thing

19:45.567 --> 19:47.633
to show that you care
about anyone but yourself,

19:47.700 --> 19:48.834
then maybe.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.001
But I know you, Dan.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.267
So...

19:53.334 --> 19:59.034
forgive me, but I'm all out of chances.

20:09.401 --> 20:11.434
What's up, my boys? Y'all ready?

20:13.401 --> 20:14.734
You know the first play, right?

20:14.800 --> 20:17.600
Just get out of eyeline
and someone call "action."

20:23.267 --> 20:24.567
Check it, chump.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.567
All right, let's try one.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.267
Action!

20:55.167 --> 20:56.533
This just might work.

20:58.267 --> 20:59.500
This will never work.

20:59.567 --> 21:00.700
If we go to Spain,

21:00.767 --> 21:03.201
then I screw Peyton
and Red Bedroom Records,

21:03.267 --> 21:05.468
and if I go on tour, then
Jamie gets homeschooled

21:05.533 --> 21:06.834
on a tour bus,

21:06.900 --> 21:09.800
and I don't get to see
my husband for months.

21:09.867 --> 21:12.500
Spain sounds cool. Good margaritas.

21:12.567 --> 21:14.067
I think that's Mexico.

21:14.134 --> 21:15.201
What's Spain?

21:15.267 --> 21:17.201
I don't know. Sangria?

21:17.267 --> 21:19.800
God, I love sangria.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.700
Really?

21:21.767 --> 21:24.967
Okay. I'm sorry. Where were we?

21:25.034 --> 21:28.067
I was just saying that of course i
want Jamie and Nathan to be happy,

21:28.134 --> 21:29.600
But I don't want to let Peyton down.

21:30.834 --> 21:33.001
See, that's what I love about you.

21:33.067 --> 21:35.368
What... that I can't make up my mind?

21:35.434 --> 21:38.401
No, that you're always worried
about what everyone else wants.

21:38.468 --> 21:41.500
Now I think the most
important question is...

21:41.567 --> 21:42.767
What do you want?

21:44.633 --> 21:46.034
So, what do you want?

21:46.101 --> 21:48.434
It's just there's
this big party tonight,

21:48.500 --> 21:50.434
and I was wondering if you could...

21:50.500 --> 21:52.468
I mean... I could score
you some more coke?

21:52.533 --> 21:53.567
Yeah.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.468
Bitch, you rock.

22:04.533 --> 22:07.900
Well, counting the last few
favors, you owe me 600 bucks.

22:07.967 --> 22:10.134
I don't have it right now.

22:12.101 --> 22:14.267
Then that's a problem.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.267
But you might have
one thing that I want.

22:16.334 --> 22:17.600
What's that?

22:17.667 --> 22:20.301
You know that red dress
that I was supposed to wear

22:20.368 --> 22:22.600
at the Clothes Over Bros show?

22:22.667 --> 22:25.800
You get me that dress, we'll be square.

22:25.867 --> 22:28.301
But that's an unreleased
original from Brooke's new line.

22:28.368 --> 22:30.567
She'd freak if that got
out. I can't give you that.

22:30.633 --> 22:32.834
Then I think the weather
report for millieville

22:32.900 --> 22:36.900
is gonna be mostly cloudy with
very little chance of snow.

22:41.167 --> 22:43.700
So am I selfish if I want to go on tour?

22:43.767 --> 22:45.067
No.

22:45.134 --> 22:47.267
Am I a bad person if I
give up Red Bedroom Records

22:47.334 --> 22:49.101
so I can go to Spain
and be with my husband?

22:49.167 --> 22:50.301
No.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.600
So, what am I supposed to do?

22:51.667 --> 22:53.267
You're supposed to help
me make this decision.

22:53.334 --> 22:55.834
Okay, look, when we were growing up,

22:55.900 --> 22:57.667
I always depended on you.

22:57.734 --> 23:01.234
I mean, nothing has changed
about that, Haley James.

23:01.301 --> 23:03.134
You're an amazing sister.

23:03.201 --> 23:04.767
And the one thing that I do know

23:04.834 --> 23:06.967
is that you always make
the right decisions.

23:07.034 --> 23:09.667
So if you go to Spain,
you're gonna be good.

23:09.734 --> 23:12.101
And if you go on tour, you'll be good.

23:12.167 --> 23:14.334
Because you're always good, Hales.

23:14.401 --> 23:17.234
You're kind of bad-ass like that.

23:19.034 --> 23:20.900
Hey...

23:20.967 --> 23:24.867
I'm sorry if I've been
tough on you lately.

23:24.934 --> 23:26.533
I guess there's a part of me

23:26.600 --> 23:28.734
That just wants to
try and fix everything.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.867
Forgive me?

23:29.934 --> 23:32.067
I don't know.

23:32.134 --> 23:34.734
Does this mean our
fight is officially over?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.134
I don't know.

23:36.201 --> 23:38.700
I haven't made up my mind yet.

23:38.767 --> 23:41.034
Shut up!

24:06.567 --> 24:09.167
You either smoke or get smoked.

24:09.234 --> 24:11.368
And you smell like smoke.

24:25.234 --> 24:30.067
Your mom and my game...
they are so phat!

24:45.301 --> 24:46.368
Yes!

24:53.633 --> 24:56.767
High five, low five, chest five...

24:56.834 --> 24:59.067
Toe five! Boo-Ya!

24:59.134 --> 25:00.567
That's my boy!

25:09.067 --> 25:10.934
Brooke, what's wrong?

25:11.001 --> 25:14.700
You told Alex that I
can't have children?

25:14.767 --> 25:16.001
Hey...

25:16.067 --> 25:18.500
That was personal.

25:18.567 --> 25:22.001
That was between me and
you, and you told her?

25:22.067 --> 25:23.167
I'm sorry.

25:23.234 --> 25:26.034
It was wrong. I... I just slipped.

25:26.101 --> 25:28.468
How could you do that?

25:29.834 --> 25:32.201
Brooke, I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

25:32.267 --> 25:35.900
You know, what's even
worse than you telling her

25:35.967 --> 25:38.934
is that you told her you want kids.

25:39.001 --> 25:43.234
You told her the truth
and you lied to me.

25:45.067 --> 25:47.301
Brooke...

25:51.001 --> 25:51.867
High five, low five,

25:52.634 --> 25:54.001
chest five, toe five.

25:54.067 --> 25:55.533
Boo-Ya!

25:55.600 --> 25:58.734
You did such a good job, Antwon.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.667
You made the kids look so cute.

26:00.734 --> 26:03.167
I think they were an inspired choice.

26:03.234 --> 26:05.567
You're so getting
this job, Uncle Skills.

26:05.634 --> 26:06.767
It's in the bag now.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.134
Yeah, well, if I do,

26:08.201 --> 26:11.234
I'm sure gonna miss you
when I'm kickin' it in Cali.

26:11.301 --> 26:12.867
You're moving away?

26:12.934 --> 26:14.867
Yeah, well, the job's in L.A.

26:14.934 --> 26:18.001
But you never told me that part.

26:18.067 --> 26:20.400
Oh, I'm sorry, bro.

26:20.467 --> 26:23.034
I mean, it kind of
just happened so fast.

26:23.101 --> 26:24.301
I thought you knew.

26:40.368 --> 26:41.834
I'm not going on tour.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.934
I want you to have your dream.

26:44.001 --> 26:45.700
I want to show you something.

26:45.767 --> 26:46.800
Come here.

26:51.101 --> 26:52.567
What is this?

26:52.634 --> 26:54.467
This is a map of your
tour, but more than that,

26:54.533 --> 26:56.700
this is the adventure that
you and Jamie are gonna have

26:56.767 --> 26:59.001
while I'm in Spain.

26:59.067 --> 27:01.400
See, you got Disneyland in L.A.,

27:01.467 --> 27:03.167
the Grand Canyon outside of Phoenix,

27:03.234 --> 27:04.834
and then when you get to Chicago,

27:04.901 --> 27:07.967
there's this really great rib
joint I know Jamie's gonna love.

27:08.034 --> 27:11.001
I got it all figured out...
every stop, every city.

27:11.067 --> 27:13.433
- Nathan...
- And when you guys are done on the tour,

27:13.500 --> 27:15.800
you and Jamie can come to Spain, see me.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.001
See?

27:17.067 --> 27:18.634
Now you can have your dream, too.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.700
We should be together.

27:20.767 --> 27:23.134
Our family's been through so much.

27:23.201 --> 27:26.067
Do you remember our
anniversary in that old house?

27:26.134 --> 27:29.101
You told me then that you wished
you could go on tour again,

27:29.167 --> 27:31.368
and I want you to have that wish.

27:31.433 --> 27:33.167
We should just be us, Hales.

27:33.234 --> 27:36.067
If we do that, then I think
everything's gonna turn out fine.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.667
I love you, Nathan Scott.

27:39.734 --> 27:41.433
And I love our little family.

27:42.934 --> 27:44.967
I love you, too.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.067
Brooke?

27:54.134 --> 27:56.767
It's nothing.

27:56.834 --> 27:58.268
You're crying.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.734
Mom, I can't have kids.

28:14.634 --> 28:16.500
Well, I don't accept it.

28:16.567 --> 28:17.934
I just don't.

28:18.001 --> 28:20.268
We'll see a specialist...
the best that money can buy.

28:20.334 --> 28:21.500
I've been to a specialist.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.901
If there was anything
that could be done,

28:23.967 --> 28:26.301
I would be doing it.

28:26.368 --> 28:27.533
Well...

28:27.600 --> 28:29.334
It doesn't mean you can't have a family.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.368
We'll adopt.

28:30.433 --> 28:32.667
It's not the same.

28:32.734 --> 28:34.767
Yes, it is.

28:36.001 --> 28:38.634
I just wanted it so bad.

28:39.901 --> 28:42.600
How did Julian take the news?

28:42.667 --> 28:46.167
He told Alex he wants kids.

28:49.167 --> 28:51.500
Well, maybe he's not the one for you.

28:51.567 --> 28:54.734
But what if I'm the one for him?

29:03.967 --> 29:07.067
I'm sorry I made you sad, man.

29:07.134 --> 29:09.167
But it ain't no big thing.

29:09.234 --> 29:11.101
I mean, just because I'm in L.A.,

29:11.167 --> 29:13.634
that don't mean we won't
get to see each other.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.667
Like I see uncle Lucas?

29:17.467 --> 29:20.533
I know it's hard for you
to understand right now...

29:20.600 --> 29:22.800
but sometimes us adults,

29:22.867 --> 29:25.600
we have to do certain
things that we don't like.

29:25.667 --> 29:28.167
I mean, it's just part
of being a grown-up.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
And even though he's gone,

29:31.567 --> 29:34.001
your uncle Lucas loves you very much.

29:35.268 --> 29:36.634
You know how I know that?

29:36.700 --> 29:38.767
No. How?

29:38.834 --> 29:41.234
Because I love you, too.

29:41.301 --> 29:44.334
So you won't forget about me in L.A.?

29:44.400 --> 29:46.001
Never.

29:48.433 --> 29:50.268
And maybe when you're older,

29:50.334 --> 29:52.334
you can come stay with me in Cali.

29:55.268 --> 29:57.634
'cause I'll always be your Denzel.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.934
And I'll always be your Macaulay,

30:00.001 --> 30:02.201
but I'm never leaving Tree Hill.

30:05.767 --> 30:08.234
I said I was leaving.

30:08.301 --> 30:09.467
What do you mean?

30:09.533 --> 30:10.700
What happened with the quarterback?

30:10.767 --> 30:12.901
Nothing.

30:12.967 --> 30:15.867
And you know what? He's right.

30:15.934 --> 30:19.734
I have no business
jeopardizing a kid's career.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.500
I'm not an agent. I'm a liability.

30:23.934 --> 30:25.067
In six months,

30:25.134 --> 30:26.567
I'll just be the cautionary tale

30:26.634 --> 30:29.967
they talk about at company retreats.

30:30.034 --> 30:33.001
So that's it? You're just running away?

30:35.067 --> 30:36.767
Do you think Sara would let you quit?

30:39.001 --> 30:40.734
What do you think she'd say?

30:40.800 --> 30:42.800
Nothing.

30:44.433 --> 30:45.901
Sara's dead.

30:52.567 --> 30:55.001
You know, when I said I
was staying, I'm staying...

30:55.067 --> 30:56.667
Clay!

31:00.167 --> 31:01.867
I guess I'll see you.

31:26.967 --> 31:29.433
Mr. Scott.

31:29.500 --> 31:33.167
Could I please trouble you for...

31:33.234 --> 31:35.134
For an autograph. Sure. No problem.

31:35.201 --> 31:37.800
Is there something special
you wanted me to say?

31:37.867 --> 31:40.767
You don't know who I am, do you?

31:40.834 --> 31:42.268
I'm sorry, I meet a lot of...

31:44.368 --> 31:48.667
How dare you profit from
the death of my Jimmy!

31:48.734 --> 31:54.201
You let everyone believe
that he was a murderer.

31:54.268 --> 31:58.001
I had to bury him alone...

31:58.067 --> 32:00.400
alone and ashamed.

32:00.467 --> 32:05.167
And you have the nerve
to talk about forgiveness.

32:08.867 --> 32:11.734
Well, I just came here today to tell you

32:11.800 --> 32:15.101
that you will never
find forgiveness with me.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.034
Never.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.034
Where's a camera crew
when you really need one?

32:38.334 --> 32:40.467
There you are.

32:40.533 --> 32:42.268
Good. You took what I said to heart.

32:42.334 --> 32:44.067
I was worried you'd be too ashamed

32:44.134 --> 32:45.700
to show your face around here.

32:45.767 --> 32:48.368
No. I'm really sorry about last night.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.334
Now that Alex is gone,

32:50.400 --> 32:53.301
a lot is riding on you, Millicent.

32:53.368 --> 32:55.567
You're the face we're
putting out into the world.

32:57.368 --> 32:58.867
Brooke is counting on you.

33:03.433 --> 33:05.001
Don't mess it up.

33:16.201 --> 33:17.533
What the hell was that?

33:17.600 --> 33:19.301
I asked you not to say anything,

33:19.368 --> 33:21.767
and you marched right over
there the first chance you got.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.067
I never should have trusted you.

33:23.134 --> 33:24.301
I was just trying to help.

33:24.368 --> 33:25.934
- Help?
- What... you call that help?

33:26.001 --> 33:27.201
Because of you right now,

33:27.268 --> 33:28.967
Brooke and I aren't even talking.

33:29.034 --> 33:30.533
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.600
What's that supposed to mean?

33:32.667 --> 33:34.567
It means I can give
you everything you want,

33:34.634 --> 33:35.967
and Brooke can't.

33:36.034 --> 33:37.767
Okay, I thought we covered this ground

33:37.834 --> 33:39.134
after your last text,

33:39.201 --> 33:41.001
which, by the way, you
said was a big mistake.

33:41.067 --> 33:42.667
Maybe I lied...

33:44.134 --> 33:46.101
because I love you.

33:46.167 --> 33:48.700
And deep down inside,
I know you love me, too.

33:48.767 --> 33:52.034
Alex, let me be perfectly clear.

33:52.101 --> 33:53.867
I do not love you.

33:56.067 --> 33:57.134
I don't even like you.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.067
- Julian, don't.
- Alex, this is goodbye.

33:59.134 --> 34:00.234
But you like me.

34:00.301 --> 34:01.533
You said I was talented.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.400
Well, maybe I lied.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.167
Brooke told me about the movie...

34:07.234 --> 34:09.533
the real reason it didn't sell.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.567
It was because of me, huh?

34:11.634 --> 34:14.766
So it's true, then?

34:14.833 --> 34:17.500
That nobody wants me?

34:17.567 --> 34:19.800
Yes.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.643
Millie, I've been
looking all over for you.

34:31.643 --> 34:33.214
Didn't you get my calls, my texts?

34:33.214 --> 34:35.851
- My phone died. Sorry, I have to go.
- Millie.

34:36.434 --> 34:38.300
You can't go.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.422
I wasn't asking you,
Marvin. I was telling you.

34:41.266 --> 34:41.773
Hey!

34:42.074 --> 34:43.534
You need help, okay?

34:43.534 --> 34:45.606
You have a problem,
and you need real help.

34:45.606 --> 34:47.781
My only problem is you.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.851
Millicent.

34:52.547 --> 34:54.706
If you walk out that door,
don't bother coming back.

34:54.706 --> 34:55.549
Do you understand me?

35:13.849 --> 35:14.422
You okay?

35:16.532 --> 35:17.628
No.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.067
But worse than that, we're not okay.

35:22.134 --> 35:25.434
You should have never stayed here.

35:25.501 --> 35:29.067
Being here means you
have to give things up,

35:29.134 --> 35:32.867
and I am tired of making
you give things up...

35:32.934 --> 35:36.600
L.A., work, Alex, and now...

35:36.667 --> 35:39.201
Brooke, I don't care about having kids.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.967
That's not true, and you know it.

35:43.834 --> 35:45.800
You want all that...

35:45.867 --> 35:48.534
and you should have it.

35:48.600 --> 35:52.568
I don't want to be the girl
that keeps denying it from you.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.401
I think you should take another movie.

35:57.468 --> 36:00.501
And what about us?

36:00.568 --> 36:03.201
What are you really saying?

36:03.267 --> 36:06.767
I'm saying I need some time...

36:06.834 --> 36:08.468
Apart.

36:51.267 --> 36:52.900
Hi.

36:52.967 --> 36:54.568
You were Clay Evans' assistant, right?

36:54.633 --> 36:56.234
That's right.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.767
I was wondering if you could help me.

37:06.534 --> 37:07.967
Hello?

37:08.034 --> 37:09.733
What are you wearing right now?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.201
Are you kidding me?
That's the worst line ever.

37:12.267 --> 37:13.633
Where are you?

37:13.700 --> 37:15.967
I'm just trying to get an early start

37:16.034 --> 37:18.468
on this whole
long-distance romance thing.

37:20.201 --> 37:22.667
It's gonna be all right
leaving Tree Hill, right?

37:22.733 --> 37:23.800
Tell me it's okay.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.501
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

37:25.568 --> 37:27.334
And you think Jamie will understand?

37:27.401 --> 37:30.134
- He'll be fine.
- All right?

37:47.267 --> 37:48.733
Driver, let's go.

37:55.767 --> 37:58.034
I don't want to do the show.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.401
I'm done.

37:59.468 --> 38:01.334
You're funny.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.700
This is your end.

38:09.301 --> 38:11.167
It's enough for you to start over.

38:11.234 --> 38:12.667
You have your whole life ahead of you.

38:12.733 --> 38:15.367
But we're just getting started.

38:15.434 --> 38:18.167
Do you have any idea how
big this is going to be?

38:18.234 --> 38:20.568
How much is enough, Rachel?

38:20.633 --> 38:22.800
Give me the number
that'll make you happy.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.101
You're serious.

38:25.401 --> 38:26.733
Are you trying to get rid of me, Dan?

38:26.800 --> 38:28.900
No, of course not.

38:28.967 --> 38:30.867
I just want to stop.

38:30.934 --> 38:33.501
We can run away and just live our lives.

38:33.568 --> 38:35.201
We can grow old together.

38:35.267 --> 38:36.568
You're already old.

38:38.867 --> 38:40.900
What we have is enough.

38:40.967 --> 38:43.800
It will never be enough.

38:45.834 --> 38:47.600
And I shouldn't have to remind you

38:47.667 --> 38:49.633
that, as your wife,
I'm entitled to half.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.101
You're missing a few zeros.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.401
Of course, when that
clock stops running,

38:55.468 --> 38:56.501
I'm entitled to all of it.

38:58.367 --> 39:00.700
It's gonna be a great show, honey.

39:00.767 --> 39:03.101
We always give them a great show.

39:09.767 --> 39:11.167
Get lost!

39:11.234 --> 39:12.401
They got guns!

39:16.633 --> 39:19.568
The sizzle reel is officially in L.A.

39:19.633 --> 39:21.867
I just uploaded it.

39:21.934 --> 39:23.767
You think I'll get the job?

39:23.834 --> 39:25.733
Yeah, I do. You deserve it.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.800
Yeah, but you know I couldn't
have done it without you, right?

39:27.867 --> 39:29.267
Yeah.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.568
So, how'd everything go with Millie?

39:31.633 --> 39:33.700
Not good.

39:33.767 --> 39:35.534
Really bad, actually.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.667
Can you fix it?

39:39.134 --> 39:40.434
I don't think so.

39:41.733 --> 39:44.000
I'm sorry, bro.

39:46.367 --> 39:47.900
So, promise me right now

39:47.967 --> 39:50.667
that if I get this job in
L.A., you'll go with me.

39:58.234 --> 40:00.301
Don't even leave me hangin, Dawg.

40:00.367 --> 40:01.900
Okay.

40:01.967 --> 40:02.867
Deal.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.434
My man.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.334
Hey, this is Julian.

40:53.401 --> 40:54.633
Here comes the...

40:54.700 --> 40:57.034
I'm just calling to
tell you how sorry I am

40:57.101 --> 40:59.367
for all the trouble
that I've caused you,

40:59.434 --> 41:00.967
but you don't have to worry

41:01.034 --> 41:03.767
'cause from now on, I won't be
around to cause you any pain.

41:05.633 --> 41:07.733
And in spite of everything
that you said to me,

41:07.800 --> 41:09.301
I will always love you.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.000
Goodbye.
