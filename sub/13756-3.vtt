02:09.560 --> 02:11.426
Homosexual?

02:12.462 --> 02:13.762
No.

02:13.797 --> 02:15.330
On any meds?

02:15.365 --> 02:17.399
Ventolin for my asthma.

02:18.802 --> 02:20.669
- Anything else?
- No.

02:20.704 --> 02:24.906
You sure? You're looking
a little walleyed there.

02:24.941 --> 02:28.076
Um... I'm nervous.

02:30.147 --> 02:33.014
Suicidal ideations?

02:33.050 --> 02:34.982
Ideations?

02:35.018 --> 02:38.252
Are you thinking about killing yourself?

02:38.287 --> 02:40.021
No.

02:40.056 --> 02:43.424
You in fear for your life?

02:43.459 --> 02:45.292
Should I be?

02:45.327 --> 02:48.095
You a civilian?

02:49.331 --> 02:51.398
No gang affiliation?

02:53.102 --> 02:54.834
Okay.

02:54.870 --> 02:59.239
Well, in that case, good luck to you.

03:03.612 --> 03:07.448
Let me ask you something. Where
were you before you came up here?

03:07.483 --> 03:10.384
- Coffee room.
- How did you get here?

03:10.419 --> 03:12.052
What... what do you mean?

03:12.087 --> 03:15.989
Did you consume caffeinated,
dark beverages at 1100 hours

03:16.024 --> 03:18.992
before commencing to proceed,
in an orderly fashion,

03:19.027 --> 03:22.762
to the present location,
or did you walk here?

03:22.798 --> 03:25.131
We walked here.

03:25.166 --> 03:29.302
Do them again, in English.

03:29.337 --> 03:32.738
Actually, I was wondering about the
part where she mentions me throwing up.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.359
You did.

03:33.384 --> 03:37.601
I know, but is it okay if
she leaves that part out?

03:39.114 --> 03:42.014
See them?

03:42.049 --> 03:44.516
Either one of them goes
in front of a jury,

03:44.551 --> 03:46.418
he's done for.

03:46.453 --> 03:48.887
You know why? The eyes.

03:48.923 --> 03:50.889
There's no one home.

03:50.925 --> 03:53.892
They'll look at you like they'd just
as soon gut you as ask you the time.

03:53.928 --> 03:57.930
It doesn't make a difference if the prosecutor
speaks gibberish, they're going away.

03:57.965 --> 04:01.099
But Nasir Khan, he
doesn't look like them.

04:01.135 --> 04:03.335
He looks like any other
normal college kid,

04:03.370 --> 04:08.473
so the jury's gonna wonder, "Could he
really stick that knife into that girl?"

04:08.509 --> 04:10.775
We have to fight that.

04:10.810 --> 04:14.279
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't understand.

04:14.314 --> 04:17.515
- What's your first name?
- Robert.

04:17.550 --> 04:21.719
Office Robert Maldonado,
fresh out of the academy.

04:21.755 --> 04:25.056
He goes into a crime scene and
he comes out throwing up.

04:25.091 --> 04:26.758
And why shouldn't he? He's a new cop,

04:26.793 --> 04:29.226
just saw his first dead body.

04:29.262 --> 04:32.396
Now, Nasir Khan may very
well be a human being,

04:32.431 --> 04:34.331
but so was Andrea Cornish,

04:34.367 --> 04:37.568
and so is Robert "Bobby" Maldonado.

04:37.603 --> 04:42.540
So you throwing up...
absolutely, keep it in.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.842
Now, get out of here.

05:00.525 --> 05:05.862
So who's the lead on the
Khan kid case? Helen?

05:05.898 --> 05:07.863
This concerns you, John, because...?

05:07.899 --> 05:10.933
Because I'm representing him.

05:10.968 --> 05:14.237
I'm sorry, but how on earth?

05:14.272 --> 05:15.871
You had a chance to review or no?

05:15.907 --> 05:18.308
You were at the precinct
when they brought him in.

05:18.343 --> 05:19.875
That's how it happened, isn't it?

05:19.911 --> 05:23.445
He's a sweet kid, actually,
soft-spoken, sincere.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.914
Cool.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.049
I'd like to give his
loving parents some idea

05:27.085 --> 05:29.384
of what it's gonna cost, and
to do that, it'd be helpful

05:29.420 --> 05:33.089
to know how strong a
case you think it is.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.625
- Strong.
- Strong? Or strong?

05:36.660 --> 05:37.909
Wait till you see the
crime-scene photos.

05:37.934 --> 05:39.104
Ah, come on.

05:39.493 --> 05:41.659
- What do you got?
- Everything.

05:41.898 --> 05:46.167
I don't know why Helen's not on to the
next murder. This one's done. Sorry.

05:46.203 --> 05:49.671
Hey, you're not gonna get rich off
of this one. It's gonna be quick.

05:49.707 --> 05:54.243
- How's the feet?
- Okay.

05:56.379 --> 05:59.080
Ah, fuck.

06:07.758 --> 06:10.291
Three. 105.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.962
Yeah, here it is.

06:14.997 --> 06:16.764
Okay.

06:19.669 --> 06:22.069
Here goes nothing.

06:22.104 --> 06:25.906
With the proofs the District
Attorney's office think they have,

06:25.941 --> 06:31.344
there's a good chance your son
is facing life imprisonment.

06:33.382 --> 06:36.483
The good news is that's
why we go to court.

06:36.518 --> 06:39.419
But any way you slice it,
it's gonna be a long battle

06:39.454 --> 06:42.455
with no guarantee of a
successful outcome.

06:42.491 --> 06:47.594
And any lawyer who comes to you with
the words "I guarantee!" is a liar.

06:47.629 --> 06:49.396
But I promise you this.

06:49.431 --> 06:52.632
I'll work every angle I can for Naz,

06:52.668 --> 06:57.837
and I won't rest until everything
that can be done is done.

06:57.872 --> 07:00.740
- Thank you.
- However,

07:00.776 --> 07:04.010
a good defense costs money.

07:04.045 --> 07:08.247
How much? Let me tell you
this before I tell you that.

07:08.283 --> 07:12.018
Most lawyers charge by the hour. Why?

07:12.053 --> 07:14.187
Because it's to their benefit.

07:14.222 --> 07:17.890
Every phone call, email,
meeting, motion, delay,

07:17.926 --> 07:21.694
every note jotted down on every
Post-it, the meter's running.

07:21.729 --> 07:25.063
With a murder, that could
easily run $150,000.

07:25.098 --> 07:27.499
Now, I'm not gonna do that to you.

07:27.535 --> 07:29.501
I'm charging a flat fee.

07:29.537 --> 07:33.639
$75,000 if it goes to trial, and
half of that if it doesn't.

07:33.674 --> 07:36.174
If it doesn't what?

07:36.210 --> 07:38.944
- Go to trial.
- You mean if they drop the charges.

07:38.979 --> 07:42.247
Oh, no, no, no, no. They're not gonna
do that. I mean if there's a plea.

07:42.282 --> 07:44.015
A plea to what?

07:44.051 --> 07:46.918
To something less than
first-degree murder,

07:46.954 --> 07:48.987
like second-degree murder.

07:49.022 --> 07:51.756
He didn't murder anyone. Why
would you even say that?

07:51.791 --> 07:55.125
There probably won't be a plea.
The state seems confident.

07:55.161 --> 07:58.496
I just mention it in terms of my fee.

08:02.001 --> 08:05.069
$75,000.

08:05.104 --> 08:07.405
I know it sounds like a lot of money,

08:07.440 --> 08:12.442
but I guarantee you that no competent
lawyer would take it on for any less.

08:12.478 --> 08:15.279
How do you expect me to pay you?

08:15.314 --> 08:17.314
We have $8,000 in the bank.

08:17.350 --> 08:21.018
Can you get any friends
or relatives to help out?

08:21.053 --> 08:24.255
Everyone we know is in
worse shape than us.

08:25.424 --> 08:27.023
You own your own house.

08:35.734 --> 08:38.402
Look, I'll do it for 60,

08:38.437 --> 08:41.203
and that's only because I
couldn't live with myself

08:41.239 --> 08:45.608
if your son went down because of some
cut-rate, take-the-money-and-run hustler.

08:46.844 --> 08:50.280
I'm sorry. We can't afford you.

08:50.315 --> 08:52.415
Okay.

08:53.751 --> 08:57.953
Then here's your best option:

08:57.988 --> 09:01.256
a legal-aid lawyer.

09:01.292 --> 09:03.626
And here's what you get for your money.

09:03.661 --> 09:05.694
It's a guy who starts his day in court,

09:05.730 --> 09:09.498
fishing a half a dozen random
case files out of a wire basket,

09:09.534 --> 09:13.368
meets with his clients for a half hour
before going in front of the judge,

09:13.404 --> 09:15.003
takes the first deal off it,

09:15.039 --> 09:17.839
goes around the corner to Starbucks,
comes back with his latte,

09:17.874 --> 09:21.944
opens up the next file, and does the exact
same thing six times a day, every day.

09:30.921 --> 09:33.321
Look, I'll take it on for 55,000.

09:33.356 --> 09:35.389
Any less than that, it's
Naz who will suffer,

09:35.425 --> 09:39.060
since I'll be going up against
the DA armed with nothing.

09:39.095 --> 09:42.497
55?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.777
I'm writing down...

09:57.746 --> 10:01.382
$50,000.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.517
This is my retainer.

10:03.552 --> 10:07.187
If you can, uh, sign it now,

10:07.222 --> 10:11.692
I can get to work and figure
out a payment schedule later.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.963
I need to read it.

10:15.998 --> 10:18.198
Of course. I'll leave it. You
take as long as you need.

10:18.233 --> 10:22.768
But know that I can't get to
work on behalf of your son

10:22.804 --> 10:25.372
until you sign it.

10:36.118 --> 10:38.885
<i>You can see why
people liked him so much on his way up.</i>

10:38.920 --> 10:41.654
<i>I was one of them. Rangy.</i>

10:41.689 --> 10:45.591
<i>Look how fast his hands are, and
he carries power, confident.</i>

10:45.627 --> 10:49.896
<i>Distance in which they're
fighting in favor of Sillah.</i>

10:49.931 --> 10:52.064
<i>But Kovalev's tming is very good.</i>

10:52.099 --> 10:54.033
<i>Another jab to the body.</i>

10:55.836 --> 10:57.936
<i>If and when Kovalev can get going,</i>

10:57.971 --> 11:00.972
<i>he throws four- and five-punch
combinations with all power.</i>

11:17.624 --> 11:19.758
Let's go.

11:19.793 --> 11:21.793
Out!

11:21.828 --> 11:23.962
<i>Landed
a right cross moments ago.</i>

11:23.997 --> 11:26.297
<i>Got in another shot there.</i>

11:55.360 --> 11:58.095
Gate!

12:07.639 --> 12:10.307
Gate!

12:22.621 --> 12:26.255
Yeah, Freddy!

12:26.290 --> 12:30.559
Yeah! Shit! Uh! Yeah! Yeah!

12:30.595 --> 12:34.997
Oh, God! Yeah! Yeah!

12:35.032 --> 12:37.500
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

12:39.370 --> 12:41.069
Religion?

12:41.105 --> 12:43.205
Baptist.

12:47.011 --> 12:48.977
- Religion?
- Muslim.

12:52.816 --> 12:55.817
- Religion?
<i>- As-salamu alaykum.</i>

12:59.089 --> 13:01.222
Oh, come on, man. I can't
eat that other shit.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.191
Give me Arab food.

13:07.430 --> 13:08.829
Religion.

13:15.738 --> 13:19.174
- That's it?
- Baby, I can't do this no more.

13:19.209 --> 13:21.409
They're bringing in polygraphs.

13:22.845 --> 13:26.480
- We still okay?
- Yeah.

13:26.515 --> 13:30.584
You don't got to pay my rent
no more if you don't want to.

13:34.824 --> 13:36.924
Take me back.

13:40.796 --> 13:43.730
As per usual, I see
some old faces here.

13:43.765 --> 13:45.365
Glad you learned your lesson.

13:45.401 --> 13:48.468
For the freshmen, I'll keep it simple.

13:48.504 --> 13:51.271
You get told to do something, you do it.

13:51.307 --> 13:53.574
You lay a hand on any one of us,

13:53.609 --> 13:57.310
we will break out the riot gear,
put you in the fucking hospital,

13:57.345 --> 13:59.179
and add another charge.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.182
So far this year, we've
done this 2,000 times,

14:02.217 --> 14:05.318
so you might say we look forward to it.

14:05.353 --> 14:08.421
That's it. Gate!

14:14.429 --> 14:18.364
When I call your name,
you're gonna take a bed.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.936
Oh!

14:29.610 --> 14:31.977
Williams.

14:35.449 --> 14:37.783
Goddamn!

14:37.818 --> 14:40.119
Let's go! Keep the line tight!

14:41.255 --> 14:43.222
Rogers!

14:47.461 --> 14:51.563
Martinez! Brown!

14:53.533 --> 14:55.467
Davis!

14:58.372 --> 14:59.937
Holmes!

15:04.543 --> 15:06.577
Khan!

15:09.115 --> 15:11.149
Ortiz, W.

15:13.219 --> 15:16.754
Ortiz, F.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.422
Hernandez!

15:23.262 --> 15:25.562
- Did he do it?
- No question.

15:25.598 --> 15:29.667
- You know who's repping him?
- Actually, that's the best part:

15:29.702 --> 15:32.068
- John Stone.
- Who?

15:32.104 --> 15:35.305
He's no one, a precinct crawler.

15:35.340 --> 15:38.074
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:38.110 --> 15:43.413
Still, sex, drugs, and rock
'n' roll, and he's Muslim?

15:43.448 --> 15:46.516
We're on "Nancy Grace" every
night, so fast-track it.

15:46.551 --> 15:50.620
- Get it before the grand jury now.
- Yes, sir.

16:01.199 --> 16:02.832
Johnny.

16:02.867 --> 16:04.500
Helen. How are you?

16:04.536 --> 16:06.602
How are you?

16:06.638 --> 16:08.704
I'm good.

16:08.739 --> 16:11.240
Your son? Work? Your feet?

16:11.275 --> 16:14.376
They're fine. Everything's good.

16:14.411 --> 16:18.080
I was really happy when I heard
you were on the Khan case.

16:18.115 --> 16:21.416
- Good for you.
- I'm really happy you're still here.

16:21.452 --> 16:24.185
Where would I go? What would I do?

16:24.221 --> 16:27.989
Spend more time with my grandchildren?
They'd hate that.

16:30.694 --> 16:33.161
What can I do for you?

16:33.196 --> 16:35.163
You know.

16:35.198 --> 16:37.499
Oh... it's too soon for that.

16:37.534 --> 16:41.069
Come on. Let's talk.

16:46.542 --> 16:49.277
We both know what a
mess this is gonna be.

16:49.312 --> 16:54.548
This is Jodi Arias time, only this is
a good kid, no history of anything.

16:54.584 --> 16:55.850
Let's nip it in the bud.

16:55.886 --> 16:58.419
Jodi didn't have any priors

16:58.454 --> 17:00.388
and slit poor Travis' throat ear-to-ear.

17:00.423 --> 17:03.290
No one slit anyone's throat here.

17:03.325 --> 17:08.496
This girl was stabbed the same number
of times as her age, John, 22.

17:08.531 --> 17:11.632
- She was?
- Mm-hmm.

17:11.666 --> 17:14.334
Eh, there you go.

17:14.369 --> 17:16.669
It wasn't my boy, then.
That's a passion job.

17:16.704 --> 17:18.471
The knife was in his pocket.

17:18.507 --> 17:22.376
A knife in the pocket, very
different from the knife.

17:22.411 --> 17:23.742
Cops find the motive there, too?

17:23.779 --> 17:26.079
"Please, please don't
rape me" isn't motive?

17:26.115 --> 17:28.681
That's not what happened.
This isn't murder one.

17:28.717 --> 17:31.751
He didn't go out looking.
Whatever happened just happened.

17:31.787 --> 17:33.553
He's as clean as Donny Osmond.

17:33.588 --> 17:37.590
Didn't Donny Osmond get
into some sort of trouble?

17:37.626 --> 17:39.526
- Did he?
- Didn't he?

17:39.561 --> 17:41.928
I don't think so. In any
case, why take the chance

17:41.963 --> 17:45.197
this turns into Abu Ghraib?
Let's work something out.

17:45.233 --> 17:46.966
The Muslim part is only helpful.

17:47.001 --> 17:48.734
Not if there's one Muslim on the jury,

17:48.769 --> 17:51.103
and there's no way you'll
keep them all off.

17:51.139 --> 17:53.572
I'll take as many as I can get.

17:53.607 --> 17:56.809
They're not gonna like what this
is gonna do to their community.

17:56.844 --> 17:59.979
- Manslaughter.
- Excuse me?

18:00.014 --> 18:04.049
- Let's get it off your desk.
- Johnny, it's homicide.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.984
There's no way around it.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.686
There's nothing I can do for you.
I'm sorry.

18:07.721 --> 18:10.322
Just give me something back.

18:11.492 --> 18:13.425
Anything.

18:18.365 --> 18:23.134
There's a tailor I know on 33rd Street.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.503
Very reasonable.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.573
I mean this sincerely.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.978
Get something for the trial, not brown.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.195
Salim...

18:52.598 --> 18:54.531
Did you hear what I said?

18:55.834 --> 18:56.900
No.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.403
Where is it?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.739
Where is what?

19:04.210 --> 19:05.976
The cab.

19:09.214 --> 19:10.981
I don't know.

19:12.584 --> 19:16.052
Have you asked anybody?
Have you called anybody?

19:16.087 --> 19:18.688
My son is in prison.

19:18.724 --> 19:22.025
I know. I still have to make a living.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.127
I can't afford not to be working.

19:24.162 --> 19:25.661
Yusuf can't.

19:25.696 --> 19:29.499
Every day that goes by, we're
losing money that we need.

19:30.668 --> 19:33.102
I know.

19:52.489 --> 19:54.322
You see, right now,

19:54.358 --> 19:56.959
everybody taking a hard look at you.

19:57.995 --> 20:00.295
You just let them look.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.397
Anybody asks you anything,

20:02.433 --> 20:04.899
you keep your head
down, your mouth shut,

20:04.935 --> 20:06.601
and your business to yourself.

20:06.636 --> 20:09.237
'Cause they just probing for weakness.

20:10.907 --> 20:13.942
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

20:19.115 --> 20:20.615
So, what are you in for?

20:21.751 --> 20:23.551
Um, they're accusing me of...

20:23.587 --> 20:26.320
Motherfucker, what'd I just tell you?!

21:22.710 --> 21:25.745
Are you wearing perfume?

21:25.780 --> 21:28.848
Cologne, Paco Rabanne, for men.

21:28.883 --> 21:32.484
Yes, I know it's for men. Uh, where?

21:32.520 --> 21:36.355
Around my ankles, to counteract
the smell of the Neosporin.

21:36.390 --> 21:39.090
Neosporin smells like maple syrup.
What's wrong with that?

21:39.126 --> 21:40.559
At the pancake house, nothing.

21:40.594 --> 21:43.662
And if I told you it's
an allergic reaction

21:43.697 --> 21:45.730
to cologne that's hastening the spread?

21:45.766 --> 21:48.600
Then that would be ironic.

21:48.636 --> 21:49.861
Taking your antihistamines?

21:49.886 --> 21:52.538
I can't. They knock me out
halfway into the next day.

21:52.573 --> 21:54.438
Do you want to get better or not?

21:54.474 --> 21:55.266
I do. I just...

21:55.291 --> 21:57.642
Then throw out the Paco
Rabanne and the chopsticks.

21:57.678 --> 21:59.610
Start taking your antihistamines.

21:59.646 --> 22:02.080
Pick up some Saran Wrap and Crisco.

22:02.115 --> 22:07.485
Apply a large dollop to each foot
morning and night and wrap them up.

22:07.520 --> 22:11.255
You're kidding, right? I can't
walk around in public like that.

22:11.291 --> 22:14.124
Saran Wrap is clear. No
one will even notice.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.694
Do it, come back and see me in a week,

22:16.729 --> 22:20.030
and we will marvel together
at the improvement.

22:23.069 --> 22:27.137
Why not some WD-40 and
a Glad cinch sack?

22:27.173 --> 22:32.042
We're not only going after the so-called
doctor who mauled Ms. Hahn's face,

22:32.078 --> 22:34.945
but also the airline that fired
her because, as they put it,

22:34.980 --> 22:38.816
the results made it too disturbing for
the passengers to interact with her.

22:38.851 --> 22:42.419
But the surgery
was voluntary, wasn't it?

22:42.454 --> 22:46.956
You're a stewardess who served your
employer faithfully for 25 years.

22:46.991 --> 22:50.793
After awarding your silver wings
for a quarter-century of service,

22:50.829 --> 22:53.296
they start dropping hints
like confetti that you need

22:53.332 --> 22:55.298
to start keeping up your appearance,

22:55.334 --> 22:59.536
the "or else" as implicit
as a storm cloud.

22:59.571 --> 23:02.238
So you, husbandless, childless,

23:02.273 --> 23:05.507
and in terror of losing the job
you've devoted your life to,

23:05.543 --> 23:07.543
do what you know you have to do,

23:07.578 --> 23:10.579
what any woman over the age of
40 who deals with the public

23:10.615 --> 23:12.581
to earn a living has to do,

23:12.617 --> 23:16.119
what a reporter who works
for Channel 7 News,

23:16.154 --> 23:18.621
before you know it, will have to do.

23:18.656 --> 23:21.823
So was it voluntary?

23:21.859 --> 23:24.526
You tell me.

23:24.562 --> 23:27.129
<i>Put all
prohibited items in the lockers.</i>

23:27.164 --> 23:30.899
<i>weapons, cell phones,</i>

23:30.934 --> 23:33.034
<i>belts, keys</i>

23:33.070 --> 23:36.109
<i>key rings, nail
clippers,pens, pencils...</i>

23:36.133 --> 23:37.738
Good. Next.

23:37.775 --> 23:39.941
Arms out, please.

23:39.977 --> 23:42.244
Pat you down.

23:42.279 --> 23:44.646
<i>...lighters, matches...</i>

23:44.681 --> 23:45.847
Okay. Thank you.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.215
Good. Stand right here.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.516
Arms out.

23:51.321 --> 23:52.787
Got anything in your pockets?

24:11.640 --> 24:13.808
- Name?
- Mine?

24:13.843 --> 24:15.375
No.

24:15.411 --> 24:17.511
Who I'm visiting?

24:18.948 --> 24:21.448
Nasir Khan.

24:21.483 --> 24:25.452
- Spell it.
- N-a-s-i-r...

24:25.487 --> 24:27.788
...K-h-a-n.

24:33.495 --> 24:35.495
I need another one for my wife.

24:35.531 --> 24:37.997
Tell her to get in line.

24:42.637 --> 24:44.070
You need to check in too.

24:51.512 --> 24:53.746
Arms out.

24:58.118 --> 25:00.886
Lift your blouse.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.724
<i>...hands above the table.</i>

25:04.759 --> 25:06.759
<i>You are not permitted
to exchange any item</i>

25:06.794 --> 25:08.260
<i>with the person you are visiting...</i>

25:08.295 --> 25:10.195
All the way.

25:12.366 --> 25:15.433
<i>At the completion of
your visit, you must remain seated</i>

25:15.469 --> 25:18.436
<i>until the person you are visiting...</i>

25:44.564 --> 25:46.630
I liked her.

25:47.934 --> 25:50.201
She liked me.

25:51.670 --> 25:54.038
We drank.

25:55.408 --> 25:58.009
We went to bed.

25:58.044 --> 26:02.813
Woke up in the kitchen. I
don't remember going there.

26:03.883 --> 26:07.150
I went back upstairs to the bedroom.

26:12.291 --> 26:14.090
I didn't kill her.

26:14.126 --> 26:16.259
Even if you can't remember
anything, you'd know that.

26:16.295 --> 26:20.397
You'd feel it, right? I don't.

26:20.432 --> 26:24.467
- I'm not a murderer.
- Of course you're not.

26:24.502 --> 26:26.536
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

26:26.571 --> 26:30.506
Listen, you
didn't do anything, huh?

26:30.542 --> 26:34.110
The jury, they'll see
right past, uh, the...

26:34.146 --> 26:39.849
the so-called evidence and the lawyers
and all this, and they'll see you.

26:49.461 --> 26:52.962
At, uh, 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning,

26:52.997 --> 26:55.497
a 22-year-old woman, Andrea Cornish,

26:55.532 --> 26:59.634
was found stabbed to death in
her home on West 87th Street.

26:59.670 --> 27:02.438
Less than a quarter-mile
away from the murder scene,

27:02.473 --> 27:05.841
a 23-year-old male, Nasir Khan,

27:05.876 --> 27:09.177
was detained by officers
on suspicion of DUI.

27:09.212 --> 27:13.715
While in custody, a knife believed to be
the murder weapon was found on his person.

27:13.750 --> 27:18.720
Additional forensic evidence and eyewitness
accounts further tie him to the crime.

27:18.755 --> 27:24.558
He has been formally charged with
murder and was arraigned earlier today.

27:24.594 --> 27:26.260
<i>What
was their relationship?</i>

27:26.296 --> 27:28.262
<i>That's under investigation.</i>

27:28.298 --> 27:30.398
<i>Do you have
a motive for the killing?</i>

27:30.433 --> 27:32.233
<i>At this point, it looks
sexual in nature,</i>

27:32.268 --> 27:35.069
<i>but that, too, is under investigation.</i>

27:35.105 --> 27:37.771
<i>Is the suspect a citizen?</i>

27:37.807 --> 27:39.673
<i>The records show
he was born here, yes.</i>

27:39.709 --> 27:40.492
Thank you.

27:40.517 --> 27:42.842
<i>But he's Muslim.
Is that right?</i>

27:42.877 --> 27:46.413
<i>- We understand he is.</i>
<i>- Does he have ties</i>

27:46.448 --> 27:48.214
<i>to any foreign organizations?</i>

27:48.250 --> 27:50.150
<i>That's under investigation.</i>

27:50.185 --> 27:54.154
Organizations. What organizations?
What are they saying?

27:54.189 --> 27:56.556
You know what they are saying.

27:56.591 --> 27:59.025
<i>Does he have a
history of violent crimes?</i>

27:59.060 --> 28:01.326
<i>That, too,
is under investigation.</i>

28:01.362 --> 28:03.863
<i>That's all I have for you right now.
I'll update you</i>

28:03.898 --> 28:05.865
when we have more information.
Thank you.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.007
Hey, come here.

28:15.043 --> 28:18.977
Got something to say, okay?
You ready? You rolling?

28:19.012 --> 28:23.014
"Foreign organizations."
They're doing this already.

28:23.050 --> 28:24.649
My client was born here.

28:24.685 --> 28:27.719
<i>He's as American as baseball.</i>
Detective Williams, please.

28:27.754 --> 28:31.256
<i>What are they gonna do next, look
at the Chechen extremist groups?</i>

28:31.292 --> 28:35.060
<i>-What are we, in Boston?</i>
- Can you do something for me?

28:35.095 --> 28:40.164
This Khan kid killer, I would really
love the family's home address.

29:05.424 --> 29:07.124
You rape that girl?

29:08.594 --> 29:09.860
No.

29:25.210 --> 29:28.978
- From Freddy.
- Who?

29:33.418 --> 29:34.817
What for?

29:37.389 --> 29:39.355
Traction.

30:55.832 --> 30:56.864
Yeah. It's here.

30:56.899 --> 30:58.298
Great. What do we pay?

30:58.334 --> 30:59.700
Nothing till it's released.

30:59.736 --> 31:01.602
That's why we're here.

31:01.637 --> 31:02.936
You can't have it now.

31:02.971 --> 31:04.638
If you'd have called, I
could have told you that.

31:04.673 --> 31:06.440
Well, we have to come
back to get it. When?

31:06.475 --> 31:08.808
After the trial, or never.

31:08.844 --> 31:12.078
- Excuse me?
- It's your cab?

31:12.114 --> 31:16.049
It's ours, the three of us all together.

31:16.084 --> 31:18.284
Then you should all get lawyers.

31:18.319 --> 31:19.685
What are you talking about?

31:19.721 --> 31:21.855
The cab was used in the
commission of a crime,

31:21.890 --> 31:25.225
which means the state can sue in
order to keep it in a civil court.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.093
Sue? Sue who?

31:27.129 --> 31:28.862
You, the registered owners.

31:28.897 --> 31:30.830
But the suit won't get filed
until the criminal trial

31:30.866 --> 31:32.665
and however many months that'll take,

31:32.700 --> 31:35.301
which I could have told you over the
phone if you'd have called first.

31:35.336 --> 31:36.835
- Months?
- Or longer.

31:36.871 --> 31:39.405
Slow wheels of justice and all.
And I hate to say it,

31:39.440 --> 31:42.508
but you'll probably lose in civil court.

31:42.543 --> 31:46.979
Unless, uh... which of you is Khan?

31:47.014 --> 31:49.749
Him.

31:51.685 --> 31:54.719
- Is it your relative, sir?
- What?

31:54.755 --> 31:57.355
- Is it your relative who's been charged?
- Yes. My son.

31:57.391 --> 31:59.557
Did he have permission
from you to drive the cab?

31:59.593 --> 32:01.326
Not really.

32:01.361 --> 32:02.795
Well, then that's your out.

32:02.830 --> 32:04.629
You might have a chance
with that if you don't mind

32:04.665 --> 32:05.798
filing charges, grand theft.

32:05.833 --> 32:09.701
File charges against my son?
You're crazy.

32:09.736 --> 32:13.037
Hey, I'm just trying
to help you guys out.

32:17.177 --> 32:19.010
I'm no lawyer, but if he won't do it,

32:19.045 --> 32:22.180
it doesn't mean you guys can't give
it a shot since you're co-owners.

32:22.215 --> 32:26.150
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.

32:28.822 --> 32:33.657
Make sure you tell him I gave
you this card. Good luck, man.

33:33.450 --> 33:36.651
- How goes it, guys?
- All quiet on the Western Front.

33:36.687 --> 33:39.755
- Anyone still working in there?
- No. Done by all appearances.

33:39.790 --> 33:42.258
- That was fast.
- It's all right.

33:42.293 --> 33:46.961
Here you go. I come bearing gifts.

34:39.581 --> 34:41.748
Don't worry. I
won't put you on YouTube.

34:41.783 --> 34:45.652
Don't even joke around like that.
Come on.

34:48.223 --> 34:52.425
- Can I open it?
- I didn't say you could.

35:17.551 --> 35:18.750
Check the fridge.

35:18.786 --> 35:21.120
You check the fridge.

35:35.402 --> 35:37.135
Here you go.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.106
Chandra. That's right, isn't it?

36:50.141 --> 36:53.042
- Yes.
- Come here.

36:56.013 --> 36:58.013
- Crowe and Associates.
- Where you from?

36:58.049 --> 37:00.849
- Um, Baltimore.
- Your parents.

37:00.885 --> 37:05.454
- Mumbai.
- Close enough.

37:07.324 --> 37:10.536
_

37:10.561 --> 37:12.810
_

37:13.302 --> 37:14.724
_

37:14.950 --> 37:17.245
_

37:20.137 --> 37:22.404
I was just saying
that she's very pretty.

37:22.439 --> 37:24.473
She is, and very smart.

37:24.508 --> 37:28.042
Can I ask you how much you
know about Mr. Stone?

37:28.078 --> 37:29.644
Nothing.

37:29.679 --> 37:32.114
Well, there isn't much
more than that to know.

37:32.149 --> 37:35.283
Basically, Mr. Stone represents
drug dealers and prostitutes.

37:35.319 --> 37:39.687
That's the world he lives in. And when
I say "represents," I mean pleads.

37:39.723 --> 37:42.090
He already said something
about that to us,

37:42.125 --> 37:43.890
and I said, "What? Plead?"

37:43.926 --> 37:46.159
Well, that's because he doesn't
want to be in a courtroom

37:46.194 --> 37:48.795
any more than a courtroom
wants him in it.

37:48.831 --> 37:53.266
Mr. Stone is not a trial lawyer.
He's barely a lawyer.

37:53.301 --> 37:55.201
He wants his fee, wants
things over fast,

37:55.237 --> 37:58.204
and then onto the next
case, which works for him,

37:58.240 --> 37:59.939
but does it work for his clients?

37:59.974 --> 38:03.109
Well, they'll never know.
They're in jail.

38:03.145 --> 38:04.944
I didn't get a good
feeling from this man.

38:04.979 --> 38:06.712
You have good instincts.

38:06.748 --> 38:10.216
And your son deserves better than someone
who's never tried a murder case.

38:10.252 --> 38:13.119
Did he ask you to sign anything?

38:13.155 --> 38:15.054
He tried, but I didn't sign it.

38:15.089 --> 38:16.889
He left it, there.

38:16.924 --> 38:18.457
- A retainer?
- Yeah.

38:18.492 --> 38:21.493
Did he say how much he
wanted to charge you?

38:21.529 --> 38:23.195
- $50,000.
- Flat?

38:23.230 --> 38:28.167
- Excuse me?
- Flat fee, like, um, early-bird parking.

38:28.202 --> 38:31.336
I'm sorry, but just from
what I know right now,

38:31.372 --> 38:34.540
this case could easily
cost five times that,

38:34.575 --> 38:37.342
and anyone who tells you
any different is lying.

38:37.378 --> 38:39.678
- Five times that?
Uh-huh.

38:39.713 --> 38:43.715
But I will do it for nothing.

38:45.952 --> 38:48.853
Which is why I didn't come here
with a retainer in my hand.

38:48.889 --> 38:50.655
Because this is the kind of case

38:50.691 --> 38:55.293
that reminds me why I wanted
to be a lawyer to begin with.

38:55.328 --> 38:58.663
And it'll get the full
attention of my firm

38:58.699 --> 39:02.967
and all of my resources,
including Chandra.

39:10.276 --> 39:13.344
_

39:14.847 --> 39:15.913
Thank you.

39:17.517 --> 39:19.617
Thank you.

39:22.354 --> 39:24.654
It's spreading, and you
haven't gone back to the clinic?

39:24.690 --> 39:26.423
- Nope.
- Why not?

39:26.458 --> 39:29.793
'Cause I'm sick of clinics.
I'm sick of doctors.

39:29.829 --> 39:32.129
I'm sick of waiting rooms,
sick of all the bullshit,

39:32.164 --> 39:35.632
"Wrap it in this," "Soak it in
that," "Try this cream, that cream,

39:35.667 --> 39:40.537
this air purifier, that new study
that says," blah, blah, blah.

39:40.572 --> 39:45.308
You know, I think my flare-ups are an
allergic reaction to my dermatologist.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.647
Go ahead, Steve.
I got some good news.

39:50.682 --> 39:56.252
Since the last time, I decided to
jump back into the dating pool.

39:59.791 --> 40:01.557
How's that going for you?

40:01.592 --> 40:04.160
I got to tell you, I'm holding my own.

40:04.195 --> 40:07.630
That's not exactly the best
choice of words there, Steve.

40:09.700 --> 40:14.236
I'm... I'm kidding.
More power to you, brother.

40:14.272 --> 40:16.104
- And how you doing, John?
- Me?

40:16.140 --> 40:20.976
You know, I'm holding my own.

40:22.780 --> 40:26.448
<i>He drug you down the street by your hair</i>

40:26.484 --> 40:30.018
<i>and brought you back to the
house, and you're pregnant.</i>

40:30.053 --> 40:31.653
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Did you do that?</i>

40:31.688 --> 40:34.823
<i>- I don't remember that.</i>
<i>- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

40:34.858 --> 40:38.260
<i>The question is not
whether you remember it.</i>

40:38.295 --> 40:41.096
<i>Did someone tell you that you did it?</i>

40:41.131 --> 40:44.599
<i>Were you drunk, and that's why
you don't remember perhaps?</i>

40:44.634 --> 40:47.201
<i>Was he intoxicated when he did this?</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:49.069
<i>Yeah, yeah. He used to...</i>

40:49.105 --> 40:53.140
<i>He's different now, but back then...</i>

40:53.176 --> 40:55.777
- No, no red.
- Yeah.

40:55.812 --> 40:57.144
No blue, either, no.

40:57.180 --> 41:01.048
No black, no yellow, 'cause
those are gang colors.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.184
You know what I mean? And, uh...
you know what?

41:03.219 --> 41:05.519
I'll take an extra pair of socks
'cause he could always use it.

41:05.554 --> 41:07.054
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:08.257 --> 41:11.491
- Right there. All right?
- Mm.

41:11.527 --> 41:13.593
- $40.
- All right. It's a bargain.

41:13.629 --> 41:15.595
- Thank you.
- Take it easy, all right, my friend?

41:15.631 --> 41:18.097
Okay. Power to you, baby. I love you.

41:18.133 --> 41:20.801
<i>We talked to
another attorney, a real attorney.</i>

41:20.836 --> 41:24.604
<i>She's going to take over.</i>
So, what about Mr. Stone?

41:24.640 --> 41:28.575
<i>What about him? Forget about him.
He's not good.</i>

41:28.610 --> 41:30.076
How do you know?

41:30.111 --> 41:31.911
<i>Now, the first thing he said to us was,</i>

41:31.947 --> 41:34.113
<i>"Here's how much this is going to cost."</i>

41:34.149 --> 41:36.382
<i>That's all he cares about.</i>

41:36.417 --> 41:39.552
<i>This new attorney doesn't
want anything, only to help.</i>

41:39.587 --> 41:41.287
- Why?
<i>-Why?</i>

41:41.323 --> 41:43.789
- Why?
- <i>Because she can afford to.</i>

41:43.825 --> 41:46.125
<i>She makes enough money
defending rich people.</i>

41:46.161 --> 41:49.462
<i>She is a very big lawyer.</i>

41:49.497 --> 41:52.297
Baba, I kind of like Mr. Stone.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.300
<i>Like him? What's there to like?</i>

41:55.336 --> 41:58.437
<i>It doesn't matter. This is
what's happening, and it's good.</i>

41:58.473 --> 42:01.173
<i>We are very lucky.</i>

42:09.850 --> 42:11.716
Turn around.

42:23.764 --> 42:27.899
A little to the left, Sean.

42:27.934 --> 42:32.136
You want to see your fucking client,
or you want us to toss your ass out?

42:32.171 --> 42:34.472
Sorry.

42:34.508 --> 42:37.275
Grab your stuff.

42:40.146 --> 42:41.946
How's the feet?

42:41.981 --> 42:44.415
So, hey, I brought you some clothes.

42:44.450 --> 42:46.117
You can collect them after.

42:46.152 --> 42:47.851
Did your folks put some
money in your account?

42:47.887 --> 42:49.887
Uh, no. I don't think they knew to.

42:49.923 --> 42:53.757
Well, I'll make a deposit for you.
You need money in here.

42:53.793 --> 42:56.927
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

42:56.962 --> 42:58.562
Okay. Good.

42:58.597 --> 43:01.865
So, I, uh, I talked to the DA.

43:01.901 --> 43:04.435
They're moving forward,
which is to be expected,

43:04.470 --> 43:07.037
but that doesn't mean
they won't deal later.

43:07.072 --> 43:10.006
All we can do is wait to see
exactly what they have,

43:10.042 --> 43:12.443
which we'll find out once
there's a grand jury.

43:12.478 --> 43:14.311
You're not my lawyer anymore.

43:15.847 --> 43:17.480
Excuse me?

43:17.515 --> 43:20.817
My parents, they hired somebody else.

43:22.220 --> 43:23.987
Really?

43:25.357 --> 43:29.125
- Who?
- Um, Alison somebody.

43:29.161 --> 43:32.528
Alison somebody? Crowe?

43:32.564 --> 43:35.264
I don't know.

43:35.299 --> 43:37.600
That figures.

43:37.635 --> 43:39.435
Well, okay.

43:39.471 --> 43:41.403
I'm really sorry.

43:41.439 --> 43:44.707
No, no, no. I understand.
This is, you know...

43:46.010 --> 43:48.577
This is important, so...

43:48.612 --> 43:52.281
Okay, look, whatever.

43:59.890 --> 44:01.457
Here's my number.

44:01.492 --> 44:04.359
Anytime you...

44:04.394 --> 44:07.796
you want to call me, day
or night, for anything.

44:12.803 --> 44:14.469
Thank you.

44:21.478 --> 44:24.578
You got to leave first. I
can't go until you do.

44:28.551 --> 44:30.851
I think we're done here.

44:32.355 --> 44:35.756
Hey, can I give you some
last-minute advice?

44:42.097 --> 44:44.297
I can't think of any.

44:44.333 --> 44:46.600
You'll be okay.

45:12.727 --> 45:14.827
- Mr. Stone?
- Huh?

45:14.863 --> 45:18.731
I'm Chandra Kapoor. I'm working with Ms.
Crowe on the Khan case.

45:18.767 --> 45:21.034
- Okay. Let's go see her.
- Um, actually,

45:21.069 --> 45:25.404
she's asked me to tell you she's
sorry, but she's left for the day.

45:27.007 --> 45:30.309
- Chandra, huh?
- Mm-hm.

45:30.344 --> 45:32.311
Your boss is too much.

45:32.346 --> 45:34.380
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what that means.

45:34.415 --> 45:38.584
You do. She took you with her
when she stole my client.

45:38.619 --> 45:40.752
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- She didn't steal anyone, Mr. Stone.

45:40.788 --> 45:45.624
She did. But I'm talking about you now.

45:46.794 --> 45:49.628
Is that what you went to law school for,

45:49.663 --> 45:52.798
to be a prop, Ms. Kapoor?

45:58.472 --> 46:01.573
Is there a message you'd
like me to give Ms. Crowe?

46:04.877 --> 46:08.079
You know what the message is.

47:19.450 --> 47:21.050
Sorry.

47:21.085 --> 47:24.519
Can't take you. Allergic.

47:42.439 --> 47:45.472
He wants to see you.

47:45.508 --> 47:47.541
Who?

47:52.181 --> 47:54.615
Come on. Let's go.

48:29.384 --> 48:30.617
Come on.

49:01.047 --> 49:03.014
Have a seat.

49:13.827 --> 49:16.961
That guard, Tito,

49:16.997 --> 49:21.032
his daughter's having her
<i>quinceañera</i> this weekend.

49:22.568 --> 49:25.202
That's a sweet 16, only 15.

49:26.939 --> 49:29.940
But the dude lives in Brownsville, man,

49:29.975 --> 49:32.843
as shitty a hood as they come.

49:32.878 --> 49:36.280
So I said, "Man, you should be
concerned about the local thugs

49:36.316 --> 49:40.383
crashing the thing,
getting high, fighting.

49:40.419 --> 49:44.154
Next thing you know, somebody's squeezing
off shots, don't care who they hit."

49:45.590 --> 49:48.192
You know, I said, "I couldn't
guarantee that won't happen,

49:48.227 --> 49:50.660
but I could make a few phone calls,

49:50.696 --> 49:53.297
see if I can help out with that."

49:54.266 --> 49:57.033
That's what that little
thank you is for.

49:58.437 --> 50:02.972
You see, us and the guards,
we all from the same hood.

50:03.007 --> 50:05.842
Some of us even grew up together.

50:05.877 --> 50:08.778
They know our families. We know theirs.

50:08.814 --> 50:11.080
Family's everything, right?

50:12.683 --> 50:15.184
It is in a Muslim family.

50:16.687 --> 50:18.254
Yeah.

50:19.858 --> 50:22.524
I'll tell you something, man.

50:29.467 --> 50:34.236
See those brothers you pray
with, the Nation of Islam?

50:34.271 --> 50:36.605
They're not your friends.

50:36.640 --> 50:40.175
In fact, they hate your ass because
you're a natural-born Muslim,

50:40.210 --> 50:45.513
and they're just phony jailhouse
opportunists looking for better food.

50:45.548 --> 50:51.086
Don't know the difference between
Cairo, Egypt, or Cairo, Illinois.

50:51.121 --> 50:53.154
I'm Pakistani, not Egyptian.

50:53.190 --> 50:55.955
Yeah, well, my ancestors
came from Dahomey

50:55.980 --> 50:58.426
and not the Congo, but
who gives a fuck, man?

50:58.461 --> 51:03.531
See, you're a celebrity in here,
and I'm not talking the good kind.

51:03.566 --> 51:07.702
Dude kills four guys over some dope.
Okay.

51:09.406 --> 51:12.373
But murder a girl? Rape a girl?

51:12.409 --> 51:15.109
- I didn't.
- Doesn't matter.

51:15.144 --> 51:16.811
It makes no difference.

51:16.846 --> 51:20.580
See, there's a whole separate
judicial system in here,

51:20.616 --> 51:23.650
and you just been judged and juried,

51:23.685 --> 51:26.120
and it didn't come out good for you.

51:37.666 --> 51:39.900
Close your eyes.

51:43.439 --> 51:46.139
Close your eyes, I said.

52:03.458 --> 52:05.458
Give me your hand.

52:08.663 --> 52:11.430
Don't be afraid, Nasir.

52:25.645 --> 52:27.879
It feels good, right?

52:28.815 --> 52:30.882
Like silk.

52:32.819 --> 52:34.652
What is it?

52:38.658 --> 52:40.092
It's meat.

52:40.127 --> 52:42.360
You wish.

52:42.395 --> 52:44.963
It's somebody's heart.

52:44.998 --> 52:51.035
Yeah, it's meat,
but the best kind, veal.

52:51.070 --> 52:54.405
- Your people eat veal, right?
- Sometimes.

52:54.440 --> 52:58.209
Ah, but only blessed, right?

52:58.244 --> 53:01.645
- I respect that.
- Thank you.

53:01.680 --> 53:05.749
Listen to you, all polite and shit.

53:14.326 --> 53:18.729
See, the reason it feels like silk
is because from the day it's born,

53:18.764 --> 53:22.132
they keep it in a dark crate,

53:22.167 --> 53:25.569
so small they can't even turn around.

53:25.604 --> 53:29.973
And it stays there,
half-blind in the dark,

53:30.009 --> 53:34.610
drinking baby formula, waiting to die.

53:46.958 --> 53:50.259
There are some bad people in here,

53:50.294 --> 53:52.595
but I could protect you.

53:53.831 --> 53:57.132
Nasir, do you want my protection?

53:59.203 --> 54:01.671
Or do you prefer dead in the shower,

54:01.706 --> 54:03.005
with your brains bashed in,

54:03.041 --> 54:06.075
guts on the floor?

54:12.116 --> 54:14.249
It's up to you.

54:36.806 --> 54:38.973
What'd he say?

54:39.008 --> 54:42.176
He offered to help me in here.

54:42.212 --> 54:45.946
- And you said?
- I didn't.

54:45.982 --> 54:48.983
Are you crazy?

54:49.018 --> 54:51.552
Freddy wiggles five
fingers up on that tier,

54:51.588 --> 54:54.387
and five people are dead in the Bronx.

54:54.423 --> 54:59.927
Whatever he's offering, you got
to take it, no discussion.

54:59.962 --> 55:02.830
Otherwise, you are dead.

55:05.467 --> 55:07.668
No.

55:21.450 --> 55:25.752
I don't know. People like,
uh, you know, purebreds

55:25.787 --> 55:27.887
or, uh, really pretty cats.

55:27.922 --> 55:30.256
This is what I would call a, uh...

55:30.291 --> 55:34.160
- Ugly cat.
- Yeah. Yeah, kind of.

55:34.195 --> 55:36.929
- I got to sign anything or, uh...
- Nope.

55:36.965 --> 55:40.733
- All right, well, thanks.
- Yeah. You bet.

55:43.871 --> 55:47.439
How long you keep them before you,
