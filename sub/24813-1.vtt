She's not home.

09:34.033 --> 09:35.492
- It's okay, I'll wait.

09:35.493 --> 09:36.494
- She left.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.889
She's so much like you.

09:41.082 --> 09:44.293
She stole all my
money, jewelry, gun.

09:46.379 --> 09:48.607
She fell in love with a boy

09:48.631 --> 09:50.174
and they run away.

09:53.636 --> 09:57.056
- Why don't you tell
me about this boy?

10:48.274 --> 10:49.316
Hello, Eliza.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.488
- What are you doing here?

10:56.699 --> 10:59.243
- I've come to take you home.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.333
- Shouldn't you be locked up?

11:11.172 --> 11:12.816
- They let me go.

11:23.351 --> 11:24.369
- Look what I got.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.620
- Jesus Christ, Jimmy, please,

11:25.644 --> 11:28.749
do you have to bring him
here naked like this?

11:28.773 --> 11:30.813
- He was in the shower, what
the fuck do you expect?

11:30.837 --> 11:31.626
A fucking tuxedo?

11:31.650 --> 11:33.819
- He's my boyfriend, okay?

11:39.658 --> 11:43.180
That's my dad and
his buddy Jimmy.

11:46.957 --> 11:47.957

11:49.251 --> 11:51.647
Do me a favor scumbag, put

11:51.671 --> 11:54.066
You come in here in front of
my daughter and me naked...

11:54.090 --> 11:56.777
- If you had arrived
20 minutes earlier,

11:56.801 --> 11:58.987
he was all over me.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.679
With the hand he was
pulling my hair

12:00.680 --> 12:02.991
and with the other one he
was clenching my neck.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.410
And I was smiling at him.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.204
We were fucking!

12:07.228 --> 12:08.562
Do you get it?!

Okay, you okay?

15:14.665 --> 15:15.684

15:16.876 --> 15:18.501
Can you stand?

15:18.502 --> 15:21.315
I'm going after Jimmy. - Yes.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.842
Get me the fuck out of here.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.870
- Come on, you got it.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.248

16:11.972 --> 16:13.116

16:13.140 --> 16:16.018
You think any chance

16:19.814 --> 16:21.482
- Give me a second.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.714
- You said you could stand.

16:27.738 --> 16:28.757
Are you okay?

16:28.781 --> 16:30.801
Come on, stand up.

16:30.825 --> 16:32.034
Just stand up.

Okay.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.164
Okay.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.086
Do you have a phone?

16:44.046 --> 16:47.425
See if you can call
for some help okay?

16:52.388 --> 16:53.782
Hey, buddy.

16:53.806 --> 16:55.558
- There's no signal.

17:00.104 --> 17:02.106
- Check my phone, Jimmy.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.092
Okay, okay.

17:34.430 --> 17:35.890
I've got nothing.

17:36.932 --> 17:37.932
Okay.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.019
Listen to me.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.276
Listen to me.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.505
Jimmy's pretty badly hurt.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.007
Call for some help.

17:52.031 --> 17:53.592
I need you to help me carry him.

17:53.616 --> 17:55.927
I'm gonna need a hand here.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.537
- Just leave him and let's go.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.559
- What did you just say?

18:02.583 --> 18:03.769
What did you just say to me?

18:03.793 --> 18:05.336
- I said let's go.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.026
- Let's give your daughter the
benefit of the doubt, okay?

18:11.050 --> 18:11.985
Give her the benefit
of the doubt.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.236
I mean look,

18:13.260 --> 18:15.113

You wanna go back?

18:16.555 --> 18:17.783
- Okay.

18:17.807 --> 18:19.284
- I don't know what
you did in jail.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.243
You probably did some
sort of zen or something,

18:20.267 --> 18:22.496
so why don't you
start breathing.

18:22.520 --> 18:26.022
Just breathe.

18:26.023 --> 18:30.045
Breathe, give your daughter
the benefit of the doubt.

18:30.069 --> 18:31.069
Breathe.

18:35.117 --> 18:36.397
- You want me to
leave my friend?

18:36.421 --> 18:38.553
What are you saying?

18:38.577 --> 18:41.121
Get over here right now and

18:41.122 --> 18:44.083
- No, just leave
him and let's go!

18:45.418 --> 18:47.336
- What are you saying?

18:51.632 --> 18:53.568
What are you saying to me?

18:53.592 --> 18:55.988
You want me to leave my friend?

18:56.012 --> 18:57.906
Is that what you said?

18:57.930 --> 18:59.491
This is who you are?

18:59.515 --> 19:00.450
Huh?

19:00.474 --> 19:02.202
This is who you've become?!

You tell me!

19:03.894 --> 19:05.330
Huh?

19:07.378 --> 19:09.649
He's choking me,

19:09.650 --> 19:11.068
I'm your father!

19:11.694 --> 19:13.338
I'm your father!

19:13.362 --> 19:15.530
You're stealing
your mom's jewelry!

19:15.531 --> 19:16.717
Who are you?!

19:16.741 --> 19:18.010
- You wanna know who I am?!

19:18.034 --> 19:19.261
- Yeah!

19:19.285 --> 19:20.887
- You just said it!

19:20.911 --> 19:22.014
I'm a whore!

19:22.038 --> 19:23.998
I fuck around, I steal!

19:24.790 --> 19:26.852
And you're the hero!

19:26.876 --> 19:28.562
You know that I always thought

19:28.586 --> 19:31.940
you're the hero, but
you're a disappointment!

19:31.964 --> 19:34.401
You're a disappointment
right now!

19:34.425 --> 19:36.695
You were for the
last five years,

You come here, you

You tell me.

19:54.779 --> 19:55.797
Bogdan?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.073
Is this a joke?

20:15.383 --> 20:17.194
This whole time he
was in the trunk?

20:17.218 --> 20:19.887
Are you fucking crazy or what?!

20:20.971 --> 20:22.571
- I was gonna have a
little word with him

20:22.595 --> 20:24.095
and I didn't want
you to know it.

20:24.096 --> 20:25.809
But he looks fine to me.

20:25.810 --> 20:29.146
Go ahead play housewife,
it suits you.

20:34.235 --> 20:35.277
There ya go.

20:48.332 --> 20:51.419

You make a lovely couple.

Jimmy.

21:08.477 --> 21:09.770
Okay, you good?

21:16.819 --> 21:18.422
Listen to me.

21:18.446 --> 21:19.655
Do me a favor.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.719
Go look around, see if you
can find us some help.

21:23.743 --> 21:25.846
Get on the phone or something.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.723
You understand?

21:27.747 --> 21:28.747
Go on.

21:36.422 --> 21:37.422
I said go.

22:04.867 --> 22:06.702
- How did you find us?

22:10.122 --> 22:11.791
- Under the bridge.

22:12.792 --> 22:15.086
Where all the junkies are.

22:16.170 --> 22:19.423
You ask about a guy,
Bogdan Marinesco.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.228
- Don't you fucking move!

22:56.252 --> 22:57.753
How'd I find you?

22:59.797 --> 23:02.651
I'll tell you how I found ya.

23:02.675 --> 23:03.944
These scumbag friends who live

23:03.968 --> 23:06.720
under that fucking bridge.

23:06.721 --> 23:08.388
- His friends.

23:08.389 --> 23:09.533
- Yeah, his friends.

23:09.557 --> 23:11.702
Which make them your friends.

23:11.726 --> 23:14.371
They told me everything
those scumbags.

23:14.395 --> 23:15.622
They told me everything.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.624
How he's taking you to
Italy for prostitution.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.918
Are you aware of that Eliza?

23:19.942 --> 23:21.586
- No I'm not aware of that.

23:21.610 --> 23:22.504
- No?

23:22.528 --> 23:23.505
- No, and I don't believe that.

23:23.529 --> 23:24.464
- You don't believe it?

23:24.488 --> 23:27.033
Well Eliza, maybe you should.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.576
- It's not even
fucking possible.

23:29.577 --> 23:31.203
- Well maybe it is!

23:32.788 --> 23:33.831
Maybe it is.

25:43.753 --> 25:45.504
- Nobody lives here.

25:52.345 --> 25:53.345
- Okay.

25:55.181 --> 25:56.742
Tell you what.

25:56.766 --> 25:58.206
I think it's best
we get some shelter

25:58.230 --> 25:59.453
in there anyways.

25:59.477 --> 26:00.537
What do you think, Jimmy?

26:00.561 --> 26:01.830
Can you make it?

26:01.854 --> 26:03.563
- I think it beats the
shit out of here.

26:03.564 --> 26:05.334
- You got it, pal.

26:05.358 --> 26:06.691
Well we're gonna find out.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.172
Let me help you up,
give me your hand.

26:08.196 --> 26:09.196
Ready?

Do me a favor.

26:26.587 --> 26:27.713
Give me this.

26:31.676 --> 26:33.403
You won't be needing them.

26:33.427 --> 26:34.905
Do me a favor.

26:34.929 --> 26:35.989
And carry that okay.

26:36.013 --> 26:37.157
Come on, pick it up.

26:37.181 --> 26:38.182
Pick it up.

29:04.662 --> 29:07.391

29:07.415 --> 29:10.560
- Well you probably feel
right at home, don't ya?

29:10.584 --> 29:13.021
- Let's move into
this room, okay guys?

29:13.045 --> 29:16.274
Come on Jimmy, let
me help you up.

29:16.298 --> 29:17.192
Give me your hand.

29:17.216 --> 29:18.986
- Oh, oh, oh.

29:19.010 --> 29:21.113
- Nice and easy.

29:21.137 --> 29:22.430
- Motherfucker.

29:24.515 --> 29:25.515
- Come.

29:52.626 --> 29:53.626
Jesus.

30:19.278 --> 30:20.278
- Oh shit.

30:21.072 --> 30:22.531
I got the candle.

30:35.252 --> 30:36.295
- Here Nick.

30:40.257 --> 30:41.485
How is it.

30:41.509 --> 30:42.749
- Jimmy, they look broken, man.

30:42.773 --> 30:43.386
- You think so?

30:43.386 --> 30:44.237
- Yeah.

30:44.261 --> 30:45.888
- They feel broken.

31:08.828 --> 31:09.828
Nick.

31:34.562 --> 31:37.124
- I need to find a bathroom.

31:39.191 --> 31:42.319
- You're not going anywhere.

31:48.534 --> 31:50.870
Maybe I should go with you.

32:00.629 --> 32:02.691
- I don't think so.

32:02.715 --> 32:05.444
- How do you know where
the bathroom is?

32:05.468 --> 32:06.719
- I'll find it.

32:14.018 --> 32:16.413
- I wanna share something.

32:16.437 --> 32:18.439
- What do ya got there?

32:21.275 --> 32:22.275
- Come on.

32:49.762 --> 32:50.762
- Oh, God.

33:39.812 --> 33:40.812
Hey, Nicky.

33:41.897 --> 33:45.526
Billy hitter here's got
a little surprise.

33:56.871 --> 33:59.224
- So, let me ask you.

33:59.248 --> 34:00.892
My daughter do this
stuff with you?

34:00.916 --> 34:02.293
- Yeah she does.

34:03.730 --> 34:04.730
- She does?

34:04.754 --> 34:05.754
- Yeah.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.946
- I'm gonna give
you an opportunity

34:12.969 --> 34:14.489
to tell me the truth.

34:14.513 --> 34:15.833
You really think
I'm gonna let you

34:15.857 --> 34:17.326
get away this?

34:17.350 --> 34:19.893
Prostituting my daughter?

34:19.893 --> 34:21.413
You fucking scumbag.

34:21.437 --> 34:23.646
You see, my and my pal here

34:23.647 --> 34:24.958
visited your friends under that

34:24.982 --> 34:27.753
fucking shit hole of a bridge.

34:29.362 --> 34:31.340
- You shut the fuck up!

34:31.364 --> 34:33.531
I've been stuck in this
cunt hole of a country

34:33.532 --> 34:34.991
in this shit hole of a prison.

34:34.992 --> 34:37.596
I understand everything the
two of you were saying.

34:47.004 --> 34:48.982
- I'm going to the
cops, motherfuckers.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.132
- You're not fucking
going anywhere!

34:51.132 --> 34:55.136
What you gonna do is tell me
where Bogdan Marinesco is.

34:55.137 --> 34:56.281
- I don't know him.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.574
- You sure you don't know?

34:58.891 --> 34:59.910
- What did he do?

34:59.934 --> 35:02.079
- None of your fucking business!

35:02.103 --> 35:03.830
You know him now?

35:03.854 --> 35:06.482
- He went with a girl in Italy.

35:07.274 --> 35:08.960
- Now he can talk.

35:08.984 --> 35:10.069
Good for you.

35:12.530 --> 35:13.530
- When?

35:14.323 --> 35:15.759
- Yesterday.

35:15.783 --> 35:17.993
- He's going to sell her as
a prostitute over there.

35:17.994 --> 35:20.764
There is this dude, the pimp,

35:20.788 --> 35:22.432
who's interested in buying her.

35:22.456 --> 35:23.873
- That's all right.

35:23.874 --> 35:26.043
Does she know about this?

35:27.044 --> 35:29.523
- Yeah right.

35:33.509 --> 35:36.469
- Who would have
known, right Jimmy?

35:36.470 --> 35:39.449
What am I thinking, right Jimmy?

35:42.268 --> 35:43.495
Come on, talk to me.

35:43.519 --> 35:46.104
- It was just a
bunch of monkeys.

35:46.105 --> 35:47.708
- Those monkeys
told me that you're

35:47.732 --> 35:50.544
taking my daughter to
Italy for prostitution.

35:50.568 --> 35:53.297
- No, no it was just
a modeling job.

35:53.321 --> 35:54.840
- A modeling job?

35:54.864 --> 35:55.924
That's what you call it?

35:55.948 --> 35:56.948
- Yeah.

35:58.909 --> 36:00.577
- You listen to me.

36:00.578 --> 36:03.557
I'm gonna give you one
chance to tell me the truth,

36:03.581 --> 36:06.751
then I'm gonna slit
you here to here.

36:09.045 --> 36:10.045
Okay?

36:10.921 --> 36:12.607
Talk to me.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.776
- But I love her.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.570
I just wanna maybe...

36:16.594 --> 36:18.530
- We're not alone!

36:27.938 --> 36:32.193
- Listen, wait here,
we'll be right back.

36:53.255 --> 36:54.924
I can't believe it!

36:56.384 --> 36:57.819
- Why would you
give that fucking

36:57.843 --> 37:00.513
nut the money and a loaded gun?

37:01.430 --> 37:03.075
Huh man?

37:03.099 --> 37:05.619
- Jimmy, I'm just
looking after Eliza.

37:05.643 --> 37:07.245
Figure we may need a
little protection

37:07.269 --> 37:09.081
in case something's going down.

37:09.105 --> 37:13.460
Besides, he ain't going
nowhere without this.

37:13.484 --> 37:15.837
That junky motherfucker.

37:15.861 --> 37:18.131
Pulling out blow in front of me.

37:18.155 --> 37:19.841
I should have slit
his fucking throat.

37:19.865 --> 37:22.368
I tell ya, little cocksucker.

37:23.536 --> 37:25.555
I mean, what happened man?

37:25.579 --> 37:29.124
My little baby, she was a
fucking angel five years ago.

37:29.125 --> 37:30.978
Top of the class, Jimmy.

37:31.002 --> 37:32.479
Top of the fucking class.

37:36.257 --> 37:37.985
Five years go by,

37:38.009 --> 37:41.780
bam, she's dating a
fucking degenerate junky.

37:41.804 --> 37:42.864
My fault?

37:42.888 --> 37:45.242
I mean, nothing I can do right?

37:45.266 --> 37:46.451
It's all me.

37:46.475 --> 37:47.995
- Well Nick, there's
an old saying.

37:48.019 --> 37:51.772
The apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

37:53.649 --> 37:55.002
You know what I mean?

37:55.026 --> 37:56.044
- The apple?

37:56.068 --> 37:57.348
- Oh, it just means
you've got to

37:57.372 --> 37:58.692
take some responsibility
you know?

37:58.716 --> 38:01.758
I mean, it's not just your wife.

38:01.782 --> 38:03.552
I'm just saying.

38:03.576 --> 38:05.095
- Jesus, Jimmy.

38:05.119 --> 38:07.079
- I'm just saying, Nick.

39:15.815 --> 39:18.191
- Can you believe
this fucking guy?

39:18.192 --> 39:19.169
I mean, really, Jimmy,

39:19.193 --> 39:20.170
next thing you know he's gonna

39:20.194 --> 39:22.047
be calling for a green card.

39:22.071 --> 39:23.906
A green fucking card.

39:24.992 --> 39:26.272
- And if she does marry the guy,

39:26.296 --> 39:28.720
you're gonna have a
lawyer as a son in law.

39:28.744 --> 39:30.430
- Oh, like Marty Feldman.

39:44.093 --> 39:45.093
Ah, Jesus.

39:50.766 --> 39:52.852
I've gotta tell you pal,

39:53.936 --> 39:56.373
I'm over this fucking evening.

39:56.397 --> 39:57.397
I'm tired.

39:58.482 --> 40:00.151
I'm fucking hungry.

40:01.235 --> 40:04.131
- Oh these kids and
their drugs, man.

40:04.155 --> 40:06.657
Come on there's nothing here.

40:34.769 --> 40:35.769
- Jimmy.

40:55.122 --> 40:56.122
Jimmy!

41:05.007 --> 41:08.028
- What the fuck is this thing?

41:08.052 --> 41:10.030
- I have no idea.

41:10.054 --> 41:11.889
- Jesus Christ, fuck.

41:31.534 --> 41:32.534
- Jimmy.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.751
- You good, Jimmy?

42:23.419 --> 42:25.355
- They're broken now.

42:30.634 --> 42:32.112
- Motherfucker!

42:32.136 --> 42:33.512
You cock fucker!

42:34.597 --> 42:36.015
- Relax.

43:36.409 --> 43:37.785
- What are they?

43:39.996 --> 43:41.556
- I don't know, but
there's more of them

43:41.580 --> 43:42.807
and they're coming this way.

43:42.831 --> 43:45.543
So I say we move,
and we move fast.

43:47.336 --> 43:48.796
- Where?

43:50.756 --> 43:53.216
- If we go outside we'll
have no protection.

43:53.217 --> 43:55.320
These things will
just hunt us down.

43:55.344 --> 43:59.305
I'm thinking maybe we find
ourselves a room somewhere,

43:59.306 --> 44:00.974
defensible and...

44:00.975 --> 44:01.975
- And what?

44:04.186 --> 44:07.606
- Hold on for as long
as we can I guess.

44:08.941 --> 44:10.651
- What do they want?

44:56.989 --> 44:58.240
- Shh!

45:45.871 --> 45:47.623
- Come here.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.420
- Hey Nick, how much
ammo you got left?

46:36.839 --> 46:39.192
- One in the clip, one full mag.

46:41.844 --> 46:43.387
- I got two clips.

46:46.057 --> 46:47.433
- I got nothing.

46:51.145 --> 46:52.998
I need my stuff.

46:53.022 --> 46:55.316
I just want to leave home.

47:08.245 --> 47:10.665
At least I need my gun back!

47:17.129 --> 47:19.858
- Nick, give your
daughter the gun,

47:19.882 --> 47:21.717
he'll be a lot safer.

47:30.286 --> 47:31.286
- Fuck him up!

47:31.310 --> 47:32.120
Really?!

47:32.144 --> 47:34.081
This fucking guy?!

47:34.105 --> 47:35.105
Really?!

47:36.524 --> 47:39.151
Don't you ever touch me again.

47:43.239 --> 47:44.383
Okay?

47:44.407 --> 47:45.616
Come here, huh.

47:56.335 --> 47:58.462
You remember how to use this?

48:05.219 --> 48:08.097
- What are we going to do?

48:11.434 --> 48:13.769
- Hell man, this is insane.

48:17.773 --> 48:19.858
This is insane, man.

48:19.859 --> 48:21.128
- Jimmy.
- What do you

48:21.152 --> 48:22.432
- I mean come on,
- mean by that?

48:22.433 --> 48:23.243
- You know, this is insane.

48:23.267 --> 48:24.446
- Jimmy.

48:24.447 --> 48:25.632
- What do you mean by that?

48:25.656 --> 48:26.633
- Oh come on, Nicky!

48:26.657 --> 48:28.241
You know this is insane man!

48:28.242 --> 48:30.012
You know what they were
doing down there?!

48:30.036 --> 48:33.015
We went down there and they
were fucking eating people!

48:33.039 --> 48:34.266
They had a chick there,

48:34.290 --> 48:35.790
roasting like a pig,

48:35.791 --> 48:39.313
spitting on a fire and they
were fucking eating her, man!

48:39.337 --> 48:40.147
- Who?!

48:40.171 --> 48:41.254
- I don't know!

48:41.255 --> 48:43.817
I don't fucking know!

48:49.555 --> 48:51.640
- What are we doing now?

48:58.022 --> 48:59.315
- Is that true?

49:08.199 --> 49:09.700
- Yeah it's true.

49:16.957 --> 49:18.000
- Oh my God.

49:26.842 --> 49:29.470
- You know what this is, Nicky?

49:30.513 --> 49:33.099
That car accident we got into.

49:33.891 --> 49:34.891
We died,

49:36.852 --> 49:38.312
and this is hell.

49:39.814 --> 49:42.000
And this is payback.

49:42.024 --> 49:43.943
This is payback, Nicky.

49:45.194 --> 49:46.737
And we're in hell.

49:51.158 --> 49:52.618
What about Eliza?

49:55.037 --> 49:56.037
- Yeah.

49:57.957 --> 50:00.459
Let's go get our money first.

51:24.043 --> 51:28.297
- Okay, listen up, check
your phones for signals.

51:30.424 --> 51:31.424
Anything?

51:32.593 --> 51:33.969
- You hear that?

51:34.887 --> 51:36.365
- What is it?

51:36.389 --> 51:40.059
- I don't know, it sounds
like a TV or something.

51:45.439 --> 51:47.525
- Stay close, come here.

51:57.994 --> 51:59.412
Watch your step.

53:15.071 --> 53:17.948
Seems to be coming
from this way.

54:23.324 --> 54:24.324
Jimmy.

54:24.348 --> 54:25.242
- Yeah.

54:25.266 --> 54:26.994
- Right here.

55:25.409 --> 55:26.409
It's safe.

55:27.912 --> 55:29.512
It must have been an
old foreman's office

55:29.536 --> 55:31.308
in the day or something.

55:31.332 --> 55:33.000
Jimmy, some phones.

55:57.400 --> 55:58.400
- Dead.

56:18.129 --> 56:19.505
- Jesus.

56:34.061 --> 56:36.522
- It goes down even further.

56:52.455 --> 56:53.497
- It's them.

57:02.965 --> 57:05.819
- Shit, let's go down here.

57:05.843 --> 57:08.822
- Okay, one by one,
follow Jimmy, go.

57:08.846 --> 57:09.948
- Come on, come on.

57:09.972 --> 57:10.866
- I got it.

57:10.890 --> 57:12.117
Go, go, go, go, go.

57:12.141 --> 57:14.976
- Come on, come on, come on.

57:14.977 --> 57:15.977
- Go, go.

57:21.859 --> 57:23.211
- Wait, the radio.

57:23.235 --> 57:24.129
- What are you doing?

57:24.153 --> 57:25.005
Eliza!

57:25.029 --> 57:26.739
- The radio.

57:27.782 --> 57:29.700
- Eliza, fuck!

57:37.667 --> 57:38.667
Oh fuck.

58:41.147 --> 58:43.482
- I can't move him!

58:44.775 --> 58:46.003
I can't move him.

58:46.027 --> 58:49.322
- Get off, you're not helping!

58:50.508 --> 58:51.508
Get the door!

58:51.532 --> 58:53.284
There's more coming!

59:29.070 --> 59:30.404
- Fuck!

59:38.537 --> 59:39.537
Jesus!

59:41.791 --> 59:43.292
- Ah fuck, Jesus!

59:44.210 --> 59:45.210
Go!

01:00:56.282 --> 01:00:57.867
- Jimmy, you good?

01:01:01.306 --> 01:01:02.306
- Aim for the head.

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:03.621
- Is that how it is?

01:01:03.622 --> 01:01:05.517
- That's how it is man.

Okay, hold on.

01:02:33.212 --> 01:02:34.212
Wait.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:42.470
Wait.

01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:46.017
Okay, this way, come on.

01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:51.771
Okay.

01:02:55.693 --> 01:02:56.693
Come on.

01:02:59.363 --> 01:03:00.363
I got it.

01:03:01.073 --> 01:03:02.366
- Fuck.

01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:05.535
Okay.

01:03:06.746 --> 01:03:07.746
- Let's go.

01:03:22.887 --> 01:03:23.887
Hold on.

01:03:24.513 --> 01:03:26.599
This way Jimmy, come on.

01:03:33.899 --> 01:03:34.899
Here, here!

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.877
Go, go, go, go!

Shit!

01:04:21.904 --> 01:04:22.904
- Fuck.

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.449
God, motherfucker.

01:04:33.749 --> 01:04:34.749
Fuck!

01:04:37.086 --> 01:04:38.480
Son of a bitch.

01:05:30.514 --> 01:05:32.099
- Okay, listen up.

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:36.163
We gotta keep moving,
we gotta move fast.

01:05:36.187 --> 01:05:37.664
Gotta try to find a safe place.

01:05:37.688 --> 01:05:41.001
Somewhere where we can get
the advantage, man, okay?

01:05:41.025 --> 01:05:42.669
- Safe?

01:05:42.693 --> 01:05:44.736
Did you just say safe?

01:05:44.737 --> 01:05:47.841
Are you fucking kidding me?!

01:05:47.865 --> 01:05:49.075
This is wrong!

01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:52.370
This is so wrong.

01:05:54.622 --> 01:05:56.683
This is so wrong.

01:05:56.707 --> 01:05:58.060
- What do you mean?

01:05:58.084 --> 01:05:59.978
- This is, this is...

01:06:00.002 --> 01:06:02.254
Get the fuck away from me!

01:06:04.215 --> 01:06:05.817
- You don't mean that.

01:06:08.761 --> 01:06:10.113
- You don't mean it.

01:06:10.137 --> 01:06:11.281
- It's not true!

01:06:11.305 --> 01:06:12.491
Fuck you!

01:06:12.515 --> 01:06:13.875
We love each other,
you understand?

01:06:13.899 --> 01:06:16.745
I don't care about anyone else.

01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:18.538
Especially you.

01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:20.123
- Just calm down, okay?

01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:21.440
Just calm down.

01:06:22.566 --> 01:06:24.461
- If you two hadn't showed up,

01:06:24.485 --> 01:06:25.860
none of this would
have happened.

01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:27.112
Do you understand me?

01:06:27.113 --> 01:06:28.553
- I understand, do
you understand me?

01:06:28.577 --> 01:06:29.508
It is happening.

01:06:29.532 --> 01:06:31.332
It's happening, we gotta
move, we gotta focus.

01:06:31.356 --> 01:06:32.094
Give me your hand.

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:33.118
Let's go.

01:06:34.078 --> 01:06:35.078
Let's go.

01:06:41.585 --> 01:06:42.585
Hold me.

01:07:53.574 --> 01:07:55.427
- What is this nut doing here?!

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:05.771
- What's going on?

01:08:05.795 --> 01:08:08.148
- The only safe place
is out of here.

01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:09.298
Take her out.

01:08:13.886 --> 01:08:14.886
Hey, Jimmy!

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:18.723
Man up!

01:08:19.393 --> 01:08:20.393
- Right!

01:08:20.393 --> 01:08:21.393
Come on.

01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:20.743
- Jimmy!

01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.185
Jimmy, come on, let's go!

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:28.020
- Go!

01:09:28.044 --> 01:09:29.044
Go!

01:09:33.799 --> 01:09:35.861
- Eliza, wait!

01:09:35.885 --> 01:09:36.885
Wait.

01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:04.139
- Fuck me.

01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:22.991
Nicky!

01:11:38.758 --> 01:11:39.758

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:46.700
- Yeah.

01:13:30.369 --> 01:13:31.369
- Shh.

01:14:11.369 --> 01:14:12.536
- Hey, fellas!

01:17:29.859 --> 01:17:31.378

01:17:31.402 --> 01:17:32.402
The exit.

01:17:37.074 --> 01:17:38.200
What's wrong?

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:46.792
- It's not right.

01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:59.489
- Let's go get 'em.

01:19:05.431 --> 01:19:06.431
