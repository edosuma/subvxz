I'm just joking.

03:29.046 --> 03:30.003

03:30.005 --> 03:30.836
And why are you so grossed out,

03:30.838 --> 03:33.023

Nicole stop.

03:35.775 --> 03:38.013
Why are you on your phone so much?

03:38.015 --> 03:40.073
I think Adam is cheating on me.

03:40.075 --> 03:41.575
Of course he is, he's a man.

03:42.695 --> 03:44.543
Okay fine, I'll bite.

03:44.545 --> 03:46.883
Why do you think Adam's cheating on you?

03:46.885 --> 03:49.933
You think I'm sexy.

03:49.935 --> 03:50.768
I'm flattered.

04:02.865 --> 04:03.698
You're right.

04:09.105 --> 04:09.938
I am sexy.

04:19.825 --> 04:22.173
Actually let me tell why
Adam's cheating on you.

04:22.175 --> 04:23.633
This'll be heart breaking.

04:23.635 --> 04:25.663
Number one, you moved in with him, what?

04:25.665 --> 04:26.863
After like five months.

04:26.865 --> 04:27.793
We were in love.

04:27.795 --> 04:29.733
Ugh, number two you don't hang out

04:29.735 --> 04:31.843
with your friends anymore,
you're just only hanging

04:31.845 --> 04:32.676
out with Adam.

04:32.678 --> 04:35.523
Adam, Adam, Adam, it's
basic scarcity laws.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.653
That's bullshit.

04:36.655 --> 04:38.753
No dude, you're available
to him all the time.

04:38.755 --> 04:40.333
He doesn't even want for you anymore.

04:40.335 --> 04:42.058
You're common, you're basic.

04:43.545 --> 04:44.645
How is that helping?

04:45.615 --> 04:46.446
Okay fine.

04:46.448 --> 04:47.279
I'll help.

04:47.281 --> 04:50.203
If you want to catch him cheating,

04:50.205 --> 04:51.383
you're gonna have to park your car

04:51.385 --> 04:52.383
out in front of the house,

04:52.385 --> 04:54.003
tell him you're going to
your grandparents house,

04:54.005 --> 04:56.523
whatever one's still alive,
and then wait outside

04:56.525 --> 04:58.143
the apartment building and then just wait

04:58.145 --> 05:00.173
for that blonde hussy to arrive.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.213
How do you know she's blonde?

05:01.215 --> 05:03.081
They're always blonde.

05:03.083 --> 05:03.916
Oh.

05:05.795 --> 05:07.313
Is that the adulterer summoning?

05:07.315 --> 05:08.683
No, it was my parents.

05:08.685 --> 05:10.183
They can't pay their
mortgage because my dad

05:10.185 --> 05:12.513
was in the hospital and
everyone is stressed.

05:12.515 --> 05:14.233
God, it's just like drama,
drama, drama with you.

05:14.235 --> 05:15.963
Yeah, my brother Eric who's filthy rich

05:15.965 --> 05:18.223
won't answer his fucking phone.

05:18.225 --> 05:20.313
Why don't you call him on my phone.

05:20.315 --> 05:21.565
He won't know the number.

05:23.215 --> 05:24.533
There, it's ringing.

05:24.535 --> 05:26.275

06:10.175 --> 06:12.973

for animals not for people.

06:12.975 --> 06:14.983
Anyway, that's what
Madonna said last week.

06:14.985 --> 06:17.533
Who knows if she'll
change her mind tomorrow?

06:17.535 --> 06:19.853
You actually know Madonna.

06:21.388 --> 06:23.038
Okay, I'm done here, Peace!

07:21.419 --> 07:24.048
Just a lot going on.

07:27.135 --> 07:28.338
Wanna talk about it?

07:33.235 --> 07:35.373
Eric's being a greedy dick for one,

07:35.375 --> 07:39.828

07:41.385 --> 07:42.773

You want me to come with you?

07:50.335 --> 07:51.168
No.

07:52.255 --> 07:53.558
My parents hate you.

07:59.902 --> 08:04.688
You saw that Selena, you
saw him hide his phone,

08:05.807 --> 08:07.633

08:07.635 --> 08:08.468
I saw it.

08:09.412 --> 08:11.162
And now you're talking to yourself.

08:33.385 --> 08:34.216
Hey Boo.

08:34.217 --> 08:36.107
Isn't boo
something a ghost says?

08:38.075 --> 08:38.905

08:38.908 --> 08:42.393
Uh oh, you guys breaking up?

08:42.395 --> 08:45.245

09:41.619 --> 09:44.353
Nothing is going on inside.

09:44.355 --> 09:46.128
Okay, all right.

10:13.955 --> 10:15.718
Markus, can I talk to you for a second?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.393
I get that being bitter is your vibe,

10:24.395 --> 10:26.373
but when we're working
could you ignore it?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.843
Just pretend to be happy
and shut the fuck up.

10:29.845 --> 10:31.903
Oh, is that all I have to do?

10:31.905 --> 10:32.738

- Okay?

10:41.245 --> 10:42.763
If you like hot and stupid.

10:42.765 --> 10:44.263
Why do you assume he's stupid?

10:44.265 --> 10:46.923
Look, hot people live

No.

13:48.905 --> 13:50.405

He's dumb.

13:53.435 --> 13:54.266
So?

13:54.268 --> 13:56.824
Seems like he has it all figured out.

13:56.826 --> 13:58.803

14:05.415 --> 14:07.693
I mean, he's got it, got it together.

14:07.695 --> 14:10.453

a little on the morbid side.

15:06.795 --> 15:10.273
Morbid? Why do you think morbid?

15:10.275 --> 15:11.423
Well,
I just finished taking

15:11.425 --> 15:13.568
the which deadly sin are you quiz.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.536
How'd you do?

15:15.538 --> 15:17.313
Apparently my sin of choice is wrath

15:17.315 --> 15:19.643
so that means I'm more
compatible with someone

15:19.645 --> 15:22.433
who has identified as lust.

15:22.435 --> 15:24.373
I know just the girl, or guy,

15:24.375 --> 15:25.873
if that's your thing, for you.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.643
I have to be honest, it's a little scary

15:27.645 --> 15:30.243
to think people can see how
far away I am from them.

15:30.245 --> 15:32.993
Or another way to think
of it is that everyone

15:32.995 --> 15:36.383
is so close to you, that's
it's kinda heart warming.

15:36.385 --> 15:39.618
You know, we're all together,
we all love each other.

15:40.515 --> 15:41.348
Right?

15:42.565 --> 15:44.433
We're gonna take a
break and when we return

15:44.435 --> 15:46.458
we'll talk about how it all began.

17:22.315 --> 17:24.873
Hey yeah, I just wanna
call you 'cause I think

17:24.875 --> 17:26.968
I left my jacket at the shoot.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.248
Nah, yeah what, uh huh.

17:34.005 --> 17:39.005
Actually I, I think I'm
witnessing a burglary right now.

17:40.725 --> 17:41.768
Nah, just looks,

17:43.055 --> 17:44.658
well, hold on.

17:48.645 --> 17:50.483
Well, no, I'm not gonna call the cops.

17:50.485 --> 17:53.688
I don't want 'em to question
me and deal with all that so.

17:56.503 --> 17:57.336
What?

17:58.935 --> 18:03.775
Well, you know what, false alarm.

18:03.777 --> 18:07.358
Just some guy fixing his window.

18:08.845 --> 18:12.773
So, um, I'll just come by tomorrow

18:12.775 --> 18:14.375
for that jacket, if that's cool?

18:15.805 --> 18:16.803
Yeah, all right man.

18:16.805 --> 18:17.638
Thanks.

18:41.145 --> 18:43.593
With my mom, she loves to bake.

18:43.595 --> 18:44.813
Baking with my mom...

18:44.815 --> 18:46.633
Have you seen the
new Celebrity Heights?

18:46.635 --> 18:47.466
You know I don't read

18:47.468 --> 18:49.153
that gossip website bullshit.

18:49.155 --> 18:50.255
Well I think...

19:12.015 --> 19:15.808
Sorry little guy, forgot about you.

19:20.545 --> 19:21.378
Din din.

19:29.032 --> 19:29.865
Hm.

19:33.015 --> 19:34.233
You're probably home.

19:34.235 --> 19:36.808
Alone with a dead goldfish
and a slice of pizza.

20:13.475 --> 20:15.288
Hey miss, can you spare some food?

20:16.283 --> 20:18.270
♪ Get a fucking job ♪

20:18.272 --> 20:22.855
♪ I wish it was that easy but it's not ♪

20:24.135 --> 20:25.078
Bitch.

20:58.761 --> 21:02.844
♪ This food is tainted with hate ♪

21:56.268 --> 21:57.523
- Hey, your pizza's here.
- Geez!

21:57.525 --> 21:58.613
Don't you fucking knock?

21:58.615 --> 22:02.203
I did. I
even rang the doorbell.

22:02.205 --> 22:04.423
Jesus, here just take, take it.

22:04.425 --> 22:05.453
- Thank you.
- Okay, yeah.

22:05.455 --> 22:06.968
Happy New Year, bye, okay.

24:00.726 --> 24:02.126
Almost lost my fucking life.

24:04.435 --> 24:05.268
Over that.

24:10.515 --> 24:11.348
A nut.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.633
Hey, there's a sandwich in the fridge.

25:16.635 --> 25:17.962
And I'll see ya tomorrow.

25:17.964 --> 25:20.131
I'm gonna miss you babe.

25:23.290 --> 25:24.957
I'll miss you too.

25:28.340 --> 25:30.697
Call me when you get there?

26:09.775 --> 26:10.703
Talk to me.

26:10.705 --> 26:12.743
Just sent you the new graphics.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.043
Oh great, I'll check my email.

26:14.045 --> 26:16.103
Also, your sister called.

26:16.105 --> 26:17.603
Lemme guess, she wants money.

26:17.605 --> 26:19.193
She mentioned
your parents needed help

26:19.195 --> 26:21.553
'cause your father was in the hospital.

26:21.555 --> 26:23.738
And that's supposed to be my fault?

26:24.875 --> 26:26.163
Eric, you have the money.

26:26.165 --> 26:27.353
I don't understand...

26:27.355 --> 26:29.353
You're not supposed to understand why

26:29.355 --> 26:31.203
and the reason for that
is because it's none

26:31.205 --> 26:32.036
of your business.

26:32.038 --> 26:33.053
With all due respect Eric,

26:33.055 --> 26:35.473
being your assistant, it's
my duty to shine light

26:35.475 --> 26:37.663
on things that you might
look back on and regret.

26:37.665 --> 26:39.553
You mean like hiring you.

26:39.555 --> 26:40.655
I apologize.

26:41.919 --> 26:42.752
Good.

26:51.615 --> 26:53.673
How's it going tonight, sir?

26:53.675 --> 26:56.013
Sorry to bother you, but
your neighbor's house

26:56.015 --> 26:58.913
has been broken into,
and unfortunately she,

26:58.915 --> 27:02.112
along with her six year
old son have been murdered.

27:06.465 --> 27:07.998
Did you, did you see anything?

27:11.995 --> 27:13.956
No, no.

27:13.958 --> 27:14.813
I, I didn't even know 'em.

27:14.815 --> 27:16.913
I mean, I've seen 'em around,

27:16.915 --> 27:19.043
but I've never even talked to 'em.

27:19.045 --> 27:22.023
Right right, well we're,
we're doing our rounds

27:22.025 --> 27:25.213
and making sure that no one didn't,

27:25.215 --> 27:27.293
no one saw anything
suspicious in the area.

27:27.295 --> 27:29.998
So anything of note
that you could mention?

27:31.359 --> 27:32.776
No, no.

27:34.947 --> 27:37.157
They know.

27:37.159 --> 27:39.109
Seems he apparently broke in

27:39.111 --> 27:41.808
through the front window
and must have been waiting

27:41.810 --> 27:44.261
for some time till they got back.

30:09.465 --> 30:10.683
What up girl?

30:10.685 --> 30:11.518
Hey.

30:13.015 --> 30:15.293
Just sitting across from my apartment,

30:15.295 --> 30:17.473
trying to catch my
boyfriend cheating on me.

30:17.475 --> 30:19.983
On the verge of a nervous breakdown.

30:19.985 --> 30:20.935
How was your shoot.

30:22.065 --> 30:23.003
Blah.

30:23.005 --> 30:25.403
But, I actually have a date tonight.

30:25.405 --> 30:27.263
A date? Finally!

30:27.265 --> 30:28.383
Where'd you meet him?

30:28.385 --> 30:30.243
Oh it was on this gay app.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.583
Tonight's actually the
first night we're meeting.

30:32.585 --> 30:34.683
Never actually met him before.

30:34.685 --> 30:35.516
Be careful.

30:35.518 --> 30:38.463
I just read an article about
a guy who met another guy

30:38.465 --> 30:40.903
on one of those apps and he chopped him up

30:40.905 --> 30:42.205
and made sushi out of him.

30:43.455 --> 30:46.918
Well, call me, after.

30:48.285 --> 30:49.685
All right, check in later.

32:49.275 --> 32:50.895
Hey you can't play in here.

34:46.753 --> 34:49.927
Hey, oh, I'm so sorry, are you okay?

34:49.929 --> 34:50.762
Yeah.

34:52.137 --> 34:55.152
I lost my keys, I'm
waiting for my boyfriend.

34:55.155 --> 34:57.433
Oh, I lose things all the time.

34:57.435 --> 34:58.266
Like this one.

34:58.268 --> 34:59.753
Have you seen my dog?

34:59.755 --> 35:01.443
- Oh no!
- I know.

35:01.445 --> 35:02.710
He like got out yesterday.

35:02.712 --> 35:04.210
He's a little like a dachshund, Sherwin.

35:04.212 --> 35:05.779
There's a hashtag on the back.

35:05.781 --> 35:06.643
If you don't mind like taking them.

35:06.645 --> 35:07.863
Or if you have any friends
that live in the area,

35:07.865 --> 35:08.696
I'd really appreciate it.

35:08.698 --> 35:10.903
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

35:10.905 --> 35:13.212
Okay, sorry about getting locked out.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.193
I was about to clean my room today,

35:26.195 --> 35:28.639
but something bad happened.

35:28.641 --> 35:29.974
What happened?

35:31.374 --> 35:32.291
You know.

35:36.575 --> 35:37.508
What are those?

35:40.615 --> 35:42.348
That's medicine for adults.

35:48.455 --> 35:50.855
If you need right now,
you should go to sleep.

36:08.029 --> 36:08.890
You need to take more than that

36:08.892 --> 36:11.142
if you need to go to sleep.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.828
Did you miss me?

38:43.605 --> 38:44.438
Check it out.

38:45.465 --> 38:47.137
That's impressive.

38:47.139 --> 38:47.972
Right?

38:49.712 --> 38:50.973
Oh nice.

38:50.975 --> 38:53.088
So what's under that robe?

39:02.825 --> 39:06.268
Mmm, not bad, not bad at all.

39:07.321 --> 39:08.713
You're turn.

39:08.715 --> 39:09.546
You stay right there,

39:09.548 --> 39:10.475
I'll be right back.

39:32.048 --> 39:32.996
What are you?

39:32.998 --> 39:34.165
Like superman?

39:37.098 --> 39:38.265
Nice.

39:46.935 --> 39:49.475
Don't worry babe, size doesn't matter.

39:56.925 --> 39:57.758
Selena!

40:00.045 --> 40:00.945
What's going on?

40:04.035 --> 40:06.113
I'm just uh,

40:06.115 --> 40:08.728
Oh fuck this, I'm peacing out.

40:09.581 --> 40:10.478
Having a bath.

40:12.945 --> 40:14.333
Having a bath?

40:14.335 --> 40:16.983
It's nothing, it's really nothing.

40:16.985 --> 40:18.733
You're hand is on your dick

40:18.735 --> 40:20.983
and you're ready to wank, it's nothing.

40:20.985 --> 40:23.335
Babe, you're making
something out of nothing.

40:28.175 --> 40:30.028
Please, just calm down.

40:31.025 --> 40:31.858
Calm down.

40:33.721 --> 40:34.933
Oh my god, really?

40:34.935 --> 40:35.768
Come on.

41:12.885 --> 41:14.223
I've been meeting all these guys

41:14.225 --> 41:17.783
on the dating apps and
they're all just so crazy.

41:17.785 --> 41:19.173
Don't blame the app.

41:19.175 --> 41:21.663
It got my friend Jake laid last night.

41:21.665 --> 41:24.503
You just gotta be more specific
about what you want in life.

41:24.505 --> 41:25.583
Look at me.

41:25.585 --> 41:27.143
I was just in a commercial,

41:27.145 --> 41:28.933
it was on my vision board.

41:28.935 --> 41:31.803
I just wish I could meet
someone normal for once, ya know?

41:31.805 --> 41:33.653
You mean someone that
gives you butterflies

41:33.655 --> 41:35.633
or that special spark?

41:35.635 --> 41:38.373
Nice long walk on the beach and them boom?

41:38.375 --> 41:39.343
Or in our case booom booom?

41:39.345 --> 41:42.173
What happened to chivalry, ya know?

41:42.175 --> 41:44.423
Like the guy who holds your door

41:44.425 --> 41:47.723
and you know goes on
romantic walks with you

41:47.725 --> 41:51.613
in the forest and then
push you up against a tree

41:51.615 --> 41:53.263
and have their way with you.

41:53.265 --> 41:54.758
Where are those guys?

41:56.725 --> 41:57.593
All right, I gotta go.

41:57.595 --> 41:59.303
I'm meeting this producer, I'm late.

41:59.305 --> 42:00.468
Talk to ya later.

42:51.884 --> 42:53.217
You like that?

45:16.540 --> 45:17.373
Eric.

45:19.425 --> 45:20.258
I'm coming over.

46:04.919 --> 46:06.086
Oh fuck, fuck.

46:07.577 --> 46:08.486
Hello?

46:08.488 --> 46:09.571
Hello? Oh no.

46:11.616 --> 46:12.449
Oh fuck.

50:47.128 --> 50:50.008
People have become greedy.

50:51.585 --> 50:54.983
They have the money, and
they want to die with it.

50:54.985 --> 50:57.898
I don't understand why that
guy won't help his sister.

51:00.995 --> 51:02.673
Anyone who doesn't think that taking care

51:02.675 --> 51:04.873
of their family is important,

51:04.875 --> 51:06.298
well, I feel sorry for them.

51:07.275 --> 51:09.483
The reason for my success was because

51:09.485 --> 51:13.583
of the way I was raised with so much love.

51:13.585 --> 51:15.035
That feeling never goes away.

51:16.036 --> 51:16.869
Never.

51:32.107 --> 51:35.607
Eric, I was just gonna call you.

51:37.175 --> 51:40.140
Listen, there's been an accident.

52:03.435 --> 52:06.935
Why do you wanna hurt me so bad?
