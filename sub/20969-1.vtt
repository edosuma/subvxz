00:26.226 --> 00:29.395
Woman:
You don't have to die.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.636
We can be together.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.675
Forever.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.546
Man:
Max!

02:27.548 --> 02:29.915
Max, open the fucking door!

02:29.917 --> 02:32.384
Ma...

02:40.628 --> 02:44.062
Look at this. Goddammit, Max.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.598
Are you ever gonna show up
for a fucking appointment?

02:48.068 --> 02:50.035
Let alone plug
this piece of shit in?

02:50.037 --> 02:52.771
You know they've invented
something called a cell phone.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.406
Have you heard of it?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.475
Hey, I'm talking to you.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.911
Max, do you think
you could at least attempt

02:58.913 --> 03:00.546
to act like
a fucking professional?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.414
Would that really...?

03:02.416 --> 03:06.151
Oh, no.
Max, you gotta be shitting me!

03:06.153 --> 03:07.819
Christ!
all right, sweetheart,

03:07.821 --> 03:09.288
party's over.
Come on, on your way.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.391
Come on now, on your way.
Time to go.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.527
You're a piece of work, you
know that? Let's go, come on.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.529
Hold on.

03:22.068 --> 03:23.335
Here you go, sweetheart.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.971
Man:
Oh, that... that's touching.

03:25.973 --> 03:29.007
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

03:41.488 --> 03:45.123
Man: Just imagine what it
will do for your gallery.

03:45.125 --> 03:49.261
I can see it now. Picture it:
Resurrection by Max Garman.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.797
Woman: Well, I'll take it
down for his follow-up piece.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.332
This is not going to happen
overnight.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.367
Okay, how about 50 now
and 40 for the follow-up?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.803
It's not like he's been sitting
around doing nothing.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.104
I mean, look, Sylvia,

03:59.106 --> 04:00.973
we're talking
about the fucking star here.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.641
He's got a cult following,
for fuck's sake.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.510
While Mr. Garman is certainly
an artist of stature,

04:05.512 --> 04:07.112
let's be honest...

04:07.114 --> 04:09.281
When's the last time
he did anything worth a shit?

04:09.283 --> 04:11.917
His last showing was, what,
four, five years ago?

04:11.919 --> 04:14.620
Yes, but...
When was the last time he sold?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.788
Of course.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.891
But this will justify the wait,
that we can promise.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.227
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stop by your studio.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.162
Do you have any cigarettes,
darling?

04:24.164 --> 04:28.300
Of course you're welcome
to stop by, anytime you like.

04:28.302 --> 04:29.868
Oh, fuck. Max?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.403
Christ.

04:38.811 --> 04:41.580
Max!

04:41.582 --> 04:43.615
What's your fucking problem?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.551
Goddamn it, don't tell me I just
wasted my time back there!

04:46.553 --> 04:51.156
People wanna see your work!
Max, I'm trying for you!

04:51.158 --> 04:53.025
All right, you know what?
Just sleep it off.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.193
We'll talk when you get
that shit out of your system.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.095
If you ever get it out
of your system.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.564
Do you know what I'm talking
about? You're killing yourself!

04:59.566 --> 05:01.566
What do you want from me,
man? Huh?

05:01.568 --> 05:04.202
You're always looking at me
with those greedy fucking eyes!

05:04.204 --> 05:07.472
You have no idea what I have
to go through to get it for you.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.141
Resurrection, my ass.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.512
Max, wait!

05:13.514 --> 05:17.549
Wait! For fuck's sake! Fuck.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.451
Nice job! Yeah...

05:31.464 --> 05:33.165
Oh, fuck.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.367
Oh, the boys at the factory
would love it down here.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.603
All we need now is a little bit
of velvet underground.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.507
Honestly, Max, everyone thinks
it's a great idea.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.644
We just need more of your work
down at the club.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.714
Johnny, watch the blow!
Just take that.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.582
Woman: It's like I was
saying, you know.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.652
I'm standing there
freezing my tits off

05:53.654 --> 05:57.856
and Kevin is just talking
on the phone.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.293
You remember Kevin, don't you?

06:01.295 --> 06:03.662
That corporate gigolo,
yeah, yeah.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.565
Woman: I'm trying to
make a point here.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.440
Fuck you, Jojo!

06:27.987 --> 06:30.088
Hey, what are you doing?

06:31.724 --> 06:32.958
Hey.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.561
Hey, here, Max,
take her for a ride.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.130
It's like... life...

06:38.132 --> 06:40.932
Imitating art.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.034
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Max, Max, whoa.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.636
Get her down.
Whoa, whoa, Max, Max.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.671
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck out!

06:46.673 --> 06:49.174
All of you get the fuck
outta here right now!

06:49.176 --> 06:51.276
Everybody get the fuck out!

06:51.278 --> 06:55.046
Man: Let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.315
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

06:57.317 --> 07:00.185
Man: Let's go, we're leaving.
Don't stick around.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.320
Just make sure to...

07:07.226 --> 07:09.728
What the hell
has gotten into you?

07:09.730 --> 07:11.530
Max, Max!

07:12.665 --> 07:14.699
Oh, my god. Breathe.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.812
It's gonna be all right, Max.
You're gonna be all right.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.900
Hello, Mr. Garman.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.403
Please take a seat.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.780
Fragonard.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.249
It's called the bolt.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.954
Sex... death...

08:08.956 --> 08:11.056
Sorrow.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.958
It's all there.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.860
You like it?

08:18.532 --> 08:20.465
It's a print.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.240
How are you feeling?

08:29.976 --> 08:32.077
Ahem.

08:32.078 --> 08:35.547
You're lucky you ended up
in the hospital.

08:45.925 --> 08:51.897
You're in an advanced stage
of squamous cell carcinoma.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.266
Lung cancer.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.137
I'm sorry.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.010
Um...

09:05.012 --> 09:07.712
We're... looking at weeks.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.215
Maybe a few months.

09:11.217 --> 09:15.320
Now, there is a chance
with treatment.

09:17.723 --> 09:23.028
The first phase is, uh,
an extensive chemo program...

09:23.030 --> 09:26.064
Followed by radiation therapy.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.734
We'll need to do another biopsy,

09:29.736 --> 09:31.570
as well as several...

10:43.042 --> 10:46.711
Max, how are you, buddy? Look,
they hung it behind the bar.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.046
They love it.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.416
Can't hear you.

10:53.620 --> 10:57.288
Can't hear you.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.225
Where you off to?
The party just started.

11:46.972 --> 11:50.041
Aren't you tired
of this vampire shit?

14:24.597 --> 14:27.966
Can I, uh, can I help you?

14:36.141 --> 14:39.777
How... how did you, uh, get in?

14:39.779 --> 14:42.580
Are you going to offer me
a drink?

14:43.582 --> 14:46.017
Yeah. Yes.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.489
So what can I do for you?

14:56.395 --> 14:58.630
Would you care to join me?

14:58.632 --> 15:01.232
Yeah... yeah.

15:03.369 --> 15:06.504
I, uh...

15:06.506 --> 15:08.640
I think I remember you.

15:08.642 --> 15:12.343
You came to the party with...
Jesus, there's so many names...

15:12.345 --> 15:16.381
Uh, Jamie or, uh...
Dave?

15:16.383 --> 15:18.182
You know what it's like.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.419
When you get partying,
everybody looks different.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.522
Uh, I don't remember, sorry.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.095
I would like
to have that painting.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.997
What? Th-that's a...

15:32.999 --> 15:35.967
Max Garman.
It's one of a kind.

15:35.969 --> 15:40.872
There's something about it.
It intrigues me.

15:40.874 --> 15:45.376
I know you're beautiful,
darling, but that was a gift.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.546
I couldn't part with it.
I'm sorry.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.783
What would it take
to change your mind?

16:06.365 --> 16:09.834
Man: Hey, Johnny, you there?
I heard Max went nuts.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.937
Pulled a knife on Joe.
What?

16:36.695 --> 16:39.964
Well, someone had a bad night.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.867
Bradimore! Bradimore!
I'm here.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.936
I'm here.
Jesus Christ.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.537
Do your due diligence.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.745
Uh... all right.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.748
Ahem.
Caucasian male, late 20s.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.717
Were you smoking?
What are you, my dad?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.720
Parking the car, my ass.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.758
How long you think
he's been dead?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.291
I dunno, you tell me.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.161
Have you seen this hickey
on his neck?

17:10.163 --> 17:12.430
What, no one's ever done that
to you?

17:12.432 --> 17:13.897
Not on my neck.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.200
Man: Well, I don't
wanna know about that.

17:17.636 --> 17:20.438
Here.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.641
Check this out. Hold it.

17:26.678 --> 17:30.014
This is last night.
Ah. He's a freak.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.116
Stupid kids.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.720
I'll be damned.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.725
This was the last place
he was seen alive.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.260
Did you see him with anyone?

17:42.262 --> 17:45.029
I dunno, with all the makeup
and wardrobe,

17:45.031 --> 17:48.066
one week it's vampires here,
the next week it's...

17:48.068 --> 17:49.867
Boys, what do we have next week?

17:49.869 --> 17:52.870
Man: Alice!
Oh, yeah, Alice in wonderland.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.139
So what happened to this guy,
anyway?

17:55.141 --> 17:57.809
He was found dead
in his apartment.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.211
Not a drop of blood left
in his body.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.346
Oh, must've been
the vampire night.

18:02.348 --> 18:05.383
Wait a second, you two think
a vampire did this.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.118
No, we don't.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.287
So do I need some garlic
and shit?

18:09.289 --> 18:12.023
Holy water?
Maybe some wooden stakes?

18:12.025 --> 18:13.591
A good lawyer
might be a better choice.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.960
Let me ask you something.
You think we need a warrant

18:15.962 --> 18:18.830
to get copies of your video
surveillance and guest list?

18:18.832 --> 18:21.766
Guest list?
You gotta be kidding me.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.772
Looks like I don't have
a choice.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.846
Hey.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.415
Hey, it's Max.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.152
Uh, we need to talk.

20:57.723 --> 21:01.892
Yeah, just... just, uh,
somewhere quiet.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.895
Meet me at the diner.

21:04.897 --> 21:08.633
Yeah, man, well,
it won't kill you to try, okay?

21:10.836 --> 21:12.937
Okay.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.297
Damn it.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.767
Hope nobody saw me
walk into this dump.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.602
Okay, so...

21:44.604 --> 21:47.171
Give it to me, Max.
What do you gotta say?

21:47.173 --> 21:49.206
Have you come to your senses,
or do I have to throw

21:49.208 --> 21:50.641
six months of work
down the drain?

21:50.643 --> 21:53.511
Just cut the crap, okay?
Oh, you're telling me?

21:55.013 --> 21:56.847
Will you just listen to me?

22:04.624 --> 22:07.325
Look.

22:07.327 --> 22:10.594
I've been doing some thinking,
okay?

22:10.596 --> 22:13.631
And...

22:13.633 --> 22:16.400
I think you're right.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.169
I think it's time
I get my shit together.

22:18.171 --> 22:21.072
Pf-ft! Here we go again.
Drew, I'm dead serious.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.274
Max, I'm dead serious.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.409
You've been fucking with me
for years.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.178
I gotta make a living too,
you know that?

22:27.180 --> 22:29.947
Just set up the deal,
fix the date and sit back.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.850
That's all you have to do.
Okay?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.118
I'm not kiddin'.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.822
Your salad.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.057
Fuck me. A fucking salad?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.428
What's wrong with a salad?

22:49.935 --> 22:51.602
You enjoying that?
I'm gonna fire you.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.505
You're fired.
You're fired.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.807
You don't fire me.
That's not how it works.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.743
Get outta here.

25:40.972 --> 25:42.740
Hi.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.548
Thanks for comin'.

26:00.325 --> 26:02.026
You must be Evie?

26:02.028 --> 26:04.295
Yeah?

26:04.297 --> 26:06.363
Wanna have a seat?

26:18.443 --> 26:21.345
Mind if I touch you?
Evie: Please.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.218
You know, you look familiar.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.788
Do I know you from somewhere?

26:50.709 --> 26:54.645
I, um, ahem...
I have your number.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.580
So...

26:59.217 --> 27:00.818
Thanks.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.020
Really.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.588
You remember your way out?

28:58.536 --> 29:00.671
Max:
Hello.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.543
I take it you're here
for the model ad?

30:16.848 --> 30:19.683
It's actually
not that far from here.

30:23.755 --> 30:26.723
I used to go there every day
at dawn.

30:29.928 --> 30:33.130
I've never seen the sun
like this.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.998
So harmless,

30:35.000 --> 30:36.967
warm.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.939
You're looking for a model?

30:47.178 --> 30:52.149
I'm sorry, uh...
I didn't catch your name.

30:58.256 --> 31:01.625
I didn't mention it.
No pictures.

31:03.962 --> 31:07.231
No, I... I don't do
photographs, it's just...

31:07.233 --> 31:09.499
I don't do photographs either.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.971
Okay.

31:30.488 --> 31:33.991
I wonder what it's like.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.602
You get paid every session,
of course.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.605
We can...
Make out a schedule.

32:17.635 --> 32:20.137
Only nights.

33:04.615 --> 33:07.184
Well, well, well,
what a surprise.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.554
You are capable
of waking up unaided.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.522
Considering I'm paying
for breakfast,

33:12.524 --> 33:15.025
I appreciate the gratitude.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.963
Come on, order something
to eat before we talk business.

33:19.965 --> 33:21.732
You eat the crap
they serve here.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.634
Who is she?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.169
She?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.974
The girl from last night.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.110
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:34.712 --> 33:36.246
Max, I'm telling you,

33:36.248 --> 33:38.315
I have no fuckin' clue
what you're talking about.

33:38.317 --> 33:41.184
Look, man. Last night,
I'm just sitting there...

33:41.186 --> 33:43.720
And this girl walks in.
It's like she walked out

33:43.722 --> 33:45.655
of one of my paintings, man.
I'm telling you,

33:45.657 --> 33:47.190
I-I-i haven't felt like this
in years.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.626
A painting you probably
haven't even started, right?

33:49.628 --> 33:51.928
Outstanding. The usual shit.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.330
You find a beautiful model,

33:53.332 --> 33:55.932
bang her brains out
and then all of a sudden,

33:55.934 --> 33:59.703
"oh! My inspiration, it's gone!
The mystery is gone. I..."

33:59.705 --> 34:02.406
Are we done?
Are you shitting me?

34:05.376 --> 34:07.110
Max, where you going?

34:07.112 --> 34:09.646
Fuck you.

34:11.116 --> 34:12.649
Jesus Christ.

34:41.379 --> 34:43.246
Hello?

34:44.549 --> 34:46.349
Hi. How are you?

34:48.686 --> 34:51.922
It's, uh... it's Max Garman.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.659
Yeah, long time.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.828
Is, uh...

34:57.830 --> 35:00.197
Is Elizabeth around?

35:03.267 --> 35:04.968
She did?

35:07.572 --> 35:09.439
How long ago?

35:12.110 --> 35:15.245
Oh. Um...

35:15.247 --> 35:19.316
Um... do you have
her new number?

35:23.588 --> 35:25.555
Oh, it's, uh, it's okay.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.557
No, I, um...

35:27.559 --> 35:29.860
Thanks anyway.

35:50.581 --> 35:53.083
Well, uh...

35:54.552 --> 35:57.754
Ha. You know, it took me a few
of these to be able to say this,

35:57.756 --> 36:00.724
but, uh...

36:00.726 --> 36:04.327
You know,
just looking at you, uh...

36:04.329 --> 36:06.663
I mean...

36:06.665 --> 36:09.599
I mean, my god, you...
You are...

36:09.601 --> 36:11.401
You're beautiful.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.706
Tell me why you say that.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.976
Are you kidding me?
Really?

36:19.978 --> 36:21.745
I mean, my god...

36:21.747 --> 36:23.813
Just, um...

36:23.815 --> 36:26.116
Just look in a mirror.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.353
And what would I see?

36:31.622 --> 36:33.323
I mean it.

36:33.325 --> 36:37.194
What... would I see?

36:39.797 --> 36:42.532
Well, um...

36:42.534 --> 36:45.101
You would...

36:47.305 --> 36:50.740
I'm sorry, there's...
There's...

36:50.742 --> 36:52.475
There's nothing that I could say

36:52.477 --> 36:55.412
that could do justice
to what you see in a mirror.

36:57.582 --> 37:01.184
Say, can I get you...
Can I get you another one?

37:01.186 --> 37:03.853
I'll get you another drink.
I never do that.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.590
Uh... what?

37:07.858 --> 37:11.094
Look in a mirror.

37:12.863 --> 37:16.132
That's why I'm asking you.

37:17.468 --> 37:21.271
Okay...

37:24.409 --> 37:26.843
You know what?

37:26.845 --> 37:29.980
I bet you're hungry.

37:36.554 --> 37:38.421
I think I am.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.682
Well, we've got
a ruptured carotid artery,

38:05.684 --> 38:07.384
got massive blood loss.

38:07.386 --> 38:10.453
In fact,
we've got total blood loss.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.188
What do you mean,
no blood at all?

38:12.190 --> 38:13.923
No blood at all.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.659
What causes it?

38:15.661 --> 38:18.995
Gonna have to do more tests
to find that out.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.665
We got hair strands,
we got lipstick.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.434
I think it's a woman.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.569
They found another one.

38:26.571 --> 38:29.439
Similar trauma.
Actually sounds identical.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.674
You're joking?

38:30.676 --> 38:33.576
Guy in the bedroom naked.
Massive blood loss.

38:33.578 --> 38:36.179
I think we got
a serial killer here.

38:36.181 --> 38:38.815
Oh, Jesus.
They need us there now.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.517
Let's get outta here.

39:12.616 --> 39:15.085
Woman:
Thirsty?

39:20.324 --> 39:23.059
Weren't you expecting me?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.262
I was.

39:27.665 --> 39:29.833
Thought you changed your mind.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.368
I did.

39:36.340 --> 39:38.708
Shall we get started, then?

39:40.945 --> 39:43.580
What did you have in mind?

39:44.715 --> 39:46.383
Show me who you really are.

39:58.963 --> 40:01.331
Are you afraid?

40:03.267 --> 40:07.237
No, this just helps me
beat the blank canvas.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.040
And bad paintings.

40:13.644 --> 40:15.779
So how does this work?

40:26.424 --> 40:29.826
Is that what brought you here?

40:29.828 --> 40:31.761
Curiosity?

40:31.763 --> 40:33.630
Maybe.

40:36.066 --> 40:38.334
It takes some getting used to.

40:41.739 --> 40:44.274
Sitting like that for hours.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.379
Like a corpse?

40:50.915 --> 40:54.651
Yeah... but alive.

40:54.653 --> 40:57.687
On the edge.

40:57.689 --> 41:00.123
It's that thin line
between life and death,

41:00.125 --> 41:01.591
that's what I'm after.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.593
From me?

41:03.595 --> 41:06.329
But in here.

41:13.103 --> 41:15.638
What are you after?

41:15.640 --> 41:17.474
I have to confess.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.810
Good.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.046
I'm interested in sins.

41:23.048 --> 41:25.515
It's just vanity.

41:29.086 --> 41:31.554
You can do better than that.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.294
I...

41:41.198 --> 41:44.701
I just want to see myself.

41:50.107 --> 41:52.709
That's all.

42:04.088 --> 42:06.623
There's a mirror right there.

42:13.330 --> 42:15.865
It's the sins
that make the painting.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.034
What is it, Max?

42:18.036 --> 42:21.170
Don't I inspire you anymore?

42:27.711 --> 42:29.479
Not until you let me in.

43:16.994 --> 43:18.628
Hello?

43:18.630 --> 43:20.496
Andrew: I got good news
and I got good news.

43:20.498 --> 43:23.299
Which one do you want first?
None.

43:23.301 --> 43:25.068
You know that painting
of your brother

43:25.070 --> 43:26.736
you got sitting there?

43:26.738 --> 43:30.239
Um, yeah, yeah, I, uh...

43:30.241 --> 43:31.841
Hate that one, actually.

43:31.843 --> 43:33.977
Well, I'm taking it
off your hands. It sold!

43:33.979 --> 43:37.013
You don't have to fucking
look at it anymore!

43:37.015 --> 43:39.716
Um... yeah, it's not finished.

43:39.718 --> 43:41.551
It will have
more artistic value.

43:41.553 --> 43:43.286
It's a collector's item.

43:43.288 --> 43:46.356
It sold, and about fucking
time something of yours sold.

43:46.358 --> 43:48.424
You know how many times...

44:48.586 --> 44:52.055
You missed your treatment,
Mr. Garman.

44:52.057 --> 44:56.125
That is impressive.
Must've cost you a pretty penny.

44:56.127 --> 44:58.428
You can't take this lightly.

44:58.430 --> 45:00.296
It's going to kill you
if you don't fight it.

45:00.298 --> 45:02.131
Yeah, you know,
that's something I wanted

45:02.133 --> 45:04.300
to talk to you about. I...

45:04.302 --> 45:07.170
I, um...

45:07.172 --> 45:09.405
Look, it's the strangest thing,
man.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.474
I feel like...
I feel like...

45:11.476 --> 45:14.110
I... I've been resurrected.

45:14.112 --> 45:15.778
Faith can help.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.780
But we need to do
everything we can

45:17.782 --> 45:19.782
to increase your chances...
I'm serious, man.

45:19.784 --> 45:22.285
I'm not...
I'm not dying, okay?

45:22.287 --> 45:24.520
I'm not dying.

45:24.522 --> 45:26.022
Mr. Garman...

45:26.024 --> 45:27.824
You can call me Max.

45:27.826 --> 45:29.158
Max...

45:29.160 --> 45:32.328
You won't survive much longer
without treatment.

45:35.165 --> 45:37.633
Mr... Max!

45:38.969 --> 45:42.371
You do understand
the consequences?

45:42.373 --> 45:43.706
You know, living with chemo

45:43.708 --> 45:46.776
would be like
your replica there.

45:46.778 --> 45:49.812
But, hey,
at least you're trying.

46:22.746 --> 46:25.114
Galleria Colonna.
Elizabeth speaking.

46:28.318 --> 46:29.852
Hello?

46:32.790 --> 46:34.157
Hey, Liz.

46:37.060 --> 46:39.128
Max?

46:41.398 --> 46:44.834
Max. Oh, my god.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.771
How are you?

46:50.440 --> 46:53.810
Uh... it's been awhile, huh?

46:53.812 --> 46:56.112
I know.

46:58.115 --> 46:59.415
How are things?

46:59.417 --> 47:02.685
Uh... okay.

47:02.687 --> 47:04.387
How about you?
How are you doing?

47:04.389 --> 47:08.024
I'm okay.
Here at the gallery.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.129
I heard you moved.

47:15.199 --> 47:18.301
How's work?
Are you working?

47:18.303 --> 47:21.003
Yeah. Yeah, there's, uh...

47:21.005 --> 47:24.207
There's a... a new show.

47:24.209 --> 47:27.276
New stuff.

47:27.278 --> 47:29.312
Wow.

47:29.314 --> 47:31.948
That's... great.

47:33.917 --> 47:37.153
Look, anyway,
I just called because, uh...

47:39.524 --> 47:41.090
You know, it's...

47:41.092 --> 47:44.961
Been a while and... and, uh...

47:44.963 --> 47:48.164
There's just some things
that I wanted to say, uh...

47:48.166 --> 47:50.433
You know...

47:50.435 --> 47:52.602
In the end...

47:53.837 --> 47:56.205
I know things got
pretty bad and...

47:56.207 --> 47:58.040
I wasn't a very good friend.

47:58.042 --> 47:59.575
Just a sec.

48:01.511 --> 48:04.647
I don't feel good about that.
And...

48:06.216 --> 48:08.451
You know, I really don't
feel good about the fact

48:08.453 --> 48:10.119
that we never got
to say goodbye.

48:10.121 --> 48:12.488
Thank you.

48:13.691 --> 48:15.558
We never even got...

48:15.560 --> 48:18.094
To say goodbye, Liz.

48:29.940 --> 48:32.041
Goodbye, Max.

49:46.616 --> 49:48.985
Will you get me a drink?

49:50.287 --> 49:52.088
Yeah.

50:42.939 --> 50:45.307
I can't let you in, Max.

50:47.844 --> 50:50.479
How long have you been here?

50:50.481 --> 50:52.782
I can't let you in.

51:11.868 --> 51:15.671
No, no, no.
I told you, it takes time, okay?

51:15.673 --> 51:18.774
It doesn't just happen
overnight.

51:34.558 --> 51:37.193
I know
what you're going through.

51:46.436 --> 51:47.837
What do you mean?

51:47.839 --> 51:50.339
Addiction.

51:57.714 --> 51:59.982
How did you beat it?

52:01.084 --> 52:03.419
What makes you think I did?

52:06.957 --> 52:08.991
Shall we get started, then?

53:12.656 --> 53:14.690
Okay.

53:14.692 --> 53:17.426
Deep breath.

53:19.629 --> 53:22.164
Deep breath.

53:28.673 --> 53:32.007
Tumor-induced pneumonia.

53:32.009 --> 53:35.177
You're fighting too many battles
at the same time.

53:35.179 --> 53:37.246
You should be in the hospital.

53:37.248 --> 53:39.481
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna happen.

53:41.384 --> 53:44.286
I really need to work right now.
Okay?

53:44.288 --> 53:47.056
Is there anything else I can do?

53:51.328 --> 53:54.563
You need to put your affairs
in order, Max.

54:02.405 --> 54:04.440
I gotta go.

54:06.009 --> 54:09.378
I see you got rid
of the fake Klimt, doctor.

54:11.548 --> 54:15.351
Please... call me Larry.

54:15.353 --> 54:19.622
Now that you've ruined
my enjoyment of art.

54:26.663 --> 54:28.897
I gotta get outta here.

54:35.572 --> 54:37.740
You know, Larry...

54:37.742 --> 54:40.109
You're almost there.

56:04.060 --> 56:08.030
There's no time
for distractions.

56:08.032 --> 56:10.199
I was worried
you'd changed your mind.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.101
What made you think that?

56:14.371 --> 56:17.072
Can we just get back to work?

56:20.543 --> 56:22.044
I can't.

56:28.852 --> 56:31.286
Will you let me in?

56:50.673 --> 56:53.108
I can't.

56:58.915 --> 57:01.116
If you can't love...

57:01.118 --> 57:04.386
You will never imitate life.

57:05.288 --> 57:09.324
You will never... live.

58:26.102 --> 58:29.137
Uh, Mr. Garman?

58:29.139 --> 58:32.207
Mr. Garman, cliff Roberts.

58:32.209 --> 58:34.109
This is detective bradimore.

58:34.111 --> 58:36.678
NYPD.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.147
Am I under arrest?
No, no, no, no.

58:39.149 --> 58:40.616
Just a few questions.

58:40.618 --> 58:43.552
Uh, we've got something
we'd like to show you.

58:43.554 --> 58:45.854
Oh, yeah...

58:45.856 --> 58:48.290
It's here somewhere.

58:49.759 --> 58:51.226
Ring a bell?

58:53.530 --> 58:56.365
No. Why?
He was at some kind of...

58:56.367 --> 58:59.167
Vampire rave party.

58:59.169 --> 59:01.403
Found him dead the next day.

59:01.405 --> 59:02.905
What's that have to do with me?

59:02.907 --> 59:05.040
You were there.
So were 100 other people.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.776
Yeah, well, they all showed up
in the surveillance video,

59:07.778 --> 59:10.512
except for the one person
we're interested in.

59:10.514 --> 59:11.914
Now...

59:11.916 --> 59:14.316
Everyone says that he left

59:14.318 --> 59:16.618
with a very,
very beautiful woman.

59:21.591 --> 59:24.927
Okay. And, what,
you think the chick killed him?

59:24.929 --> 59:28.297
All we know now is that
someone's out there

59:28.299 --> 59:31.166
murdering men, and methodically,

59:31.168 --> 59:33.101
believe it or not,
draining their blood.

59:33.103 --> 59:35.971
Mm, well, with all the
"vampires" running around...

59:35.973 --> 59:37.906
You believe in vampires?

59:40.610 --> 59:42.811
Look, guys, I'm really busy.
I don't really remember

59:42.813 --> 59:45.948
that night very much anyway.
No, okay. Just one question.

59:45.950 --> 59:49.618
The woman that he left with:
Pale skin, long hair,

59:49.620 --> 59:53.855
piercing eyes, and by all
accounts, drop-dead gorgeous.

59:53.857 --> 59:56.224
Now I'm figuring...

59:56.226 --> 01:00:00.529
That you're not gonna forget
a girl like that. I wouldn't.

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.833
I really wish
I could help you guys.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.368
Listen, can we come up?

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.003
Do you mind if we just
look around a bit...

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:10.472
Ah, no. Sorry. I'm right
in the middle of something.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:12.641
Hold... hold on a second.

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:16.578
Take this.

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:21.283
You be careful, okay?

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:35.831
I know he's lying
about the girl.

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:37.966
You see that twitch?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.304
So he's a twitchy guy.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:45.340
Ah, it's a liar's twitch.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:48.143
You got a lot to learn, kid.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.978
So you think it's him?

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.885
Maybe he's a part
of some kinda crazy ritual,

01:00:56.887 --> 01:01:00.355
like a... blood sacrifice
or something?

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.325
Well, for all we know,
it could be him.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:18.874
Andrew:
Hey, where the hell are you?

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:21.109
Why are the police
asking about you?

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:25.280
The gallery's on my ass
and now this?

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:28.150
Call me, goddamn it.

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.385
Please!

01:01:57.246 --> 01:02:00.215
Woman:
I just wanna see myself.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.784
There's a mirror right there.

01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:07.723
What's the matter, Max?

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:09.858
Don't I inspire you anymore?

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:14.029
Fuck!

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.820
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:41.523
As soon as you can get it
for me, thank you.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:45.927
Yeah, hi. I need some
information on a Max Garman.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:49.131
G-a-r-m-a-n.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.935
Mostly galleries, Soho,
east side, West Side.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:57.239
Yeah, I need like a file
on all of his paintings.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:03:00.008
Just whatever we can get.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.777
Thanks.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.347
Bradimore.

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:08.083
Yeah, I got 'em. Thanks.

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:43.678
Woman: Will you let me in?
Max: I can't.

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:50.285
Roberts: All we know now is
that someone's out there

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:53.088
murdering men and methodically
draining their blood.

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.957
Well, with all the "vampires"
running around...

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.827
Roberts:
Everyone says that he left

01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:00.929
with a very,
very beautiful woman.

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:03.131
Pale skin, long hair,
piercing eyes,

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:06.268
drop-dead gorgeous.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:10.038
Max: I used to go there
every day at dawn.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.574
Woman: I've never seen
the sun like this.

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:15.377
So harmless... warm.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:18.513
Max: It's actually not
that far from here.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.671
I need you.

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:21.209
Just as much as you need me.

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:28.683
I know what you are.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:34.356
And I'm not afraid.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:43.198
Stay where you are!

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.035
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:00.915
Did you hear what I said?

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:07.789
No need for a gun, detective.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:15.296
Just leave us alone.

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:17.065
I will shoot you.

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:51.966
Ah...

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:23.832
This is what I am.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.754
We don't have much time.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.508
Is it finished?

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:59.053
Nothing's ever finished.

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:09.897
You've never seen yourself,
have you?

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.747
You have to go.

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.778
You don't have to die.

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.349
We can be together.

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:44.685
Forever.

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.724
Eternal life.

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:16.150
I wish you could see what I see.

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:24.459
What about the painting?

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:35.236
You'll see it.

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:38.906
In time.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:27.154
And this is exactly
what we feared, Andrew.

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:28.789
Just a couple of days away
from opening,

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:30.591
still nothing
for the Vernissage.

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:32.527
Just give me an hour.
That's Max!

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.328
He likes to keep everyone
in suspense!

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.297
Ugh. I'm cheered
by your optimism.

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:38.065
An hour!
We'll be there with the work.

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:40.535
Finished?
finished, unfinished,

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:42.370
it will still be better
than anything else

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:44.839
you have in your gallery!
Bye!

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:49.744
Max, open the door!

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:54.315
Goddamn it.
I know you're in there!

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.555
Jesus, Max.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:02.857
Everyone at the gallery
is waiting!

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:06.227
Without you, they've got
nothing for the Vernissage!

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:09.163
Goddamn it,
where's the fucking painting?

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:12.500
Oh, my god.

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:23.711
Max, you did it,
you son of a bitch.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.179
Max, wake up.

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:28.749
Come on, Max.

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.551
Come on, buddy.

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.101
Man:
Dr. Wilson.

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:23.337
Great to see you.
Thank you.

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.622
Andrew Gardner.

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:44.625
Larry Wilkins, Max's doctor.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:49.497
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, nice to meet you.

01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:52.500
Thank you.
Thanks for... coming out.

01:17:52.502 --> 01:17:54.535
Sure. My pleasure.

01:17:54.537 --> 01:17:57.071
You know,
he never told anyone...

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:59.073
About the cancer.

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:01.442
I'm not surprised.

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:04.779
It is a tragic loss.
I'm very sorry.

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:06.380
I never got a chance
to thank him

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:08.315
for the beautiful painting
he sent me.

01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:09.984
Woman: Thank you for coming.
Right.

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:13.587
Woman: Welcome. Welcome, all.
Welcome.

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:18.259
Welcome. Welcome.

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:20.928
And thank you all for coming

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.165
to this sad
but momentous occasion.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.300
Max Garman.

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:36.343
The principal thesis
behind Max Garman's work

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:41.048
has been to define art
through life.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:44.385
Hard... raw...

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:47.388
Full life.

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.825
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.660
I present to you,

01:18:52.662 --> 01:18:56.263
on behalf
of the late Max Garman,

01:18:56.265 --> 01:18:59.467
Manhattan undying.
