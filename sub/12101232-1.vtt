01:09.059 --> 01:10.126
<i>Jesus Christ, Hannah,</i>

01:10.160 --> 01:11.995
<i>you've been in there for hours.</i>

01:13.063 --> 01:13.897
<i>Hannah?</i>

01:15.333 --> 01:16.900
<i>Hannah?</i>

01:18.270 --> 01:19.103
<i>Hannah?</i>

01:20.004 --> 01:21.238
It hasn't been hours.

01:21.273 --> 01:23.040
<i>It's been three hours.</i>

01:24.008 --> 01:25.344
I'm taking a massive shit.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.911
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

01:33.051 --> 01:34.019
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:36.389 --> 01:38.990
Confronting the realization
that the term microscopic

01:39.024 --> 01:40.926
is relative, and through
a different perspective

01:40.959 --> 01:42.396
the Earth itself is microscopic,

01:42.429 --> 01:43.831
and everything
people choose to do

01:43.863 --> 01:45.098
is just an activity to pass time

01:45.131 --> 01:46.933
until we all just
eventually die.

01:49.436 --> 01:50.270
<i>Could you
say that again?</i>

01:50.304 --> 01:52.105
<i>I couldn't really hear you.</i>

01:52.138 --> 01:53.907
I'm just reading.

01:53.941 --> 01:55.109
<i>Can you unlock the door?</i>

02:05.887 --> 02:07.656
Mom's worried about you, too.

02:08.324 --> 02:09.625
You called mom?

02:09.658 --> 02:11.293
Yeah, I mean you're going
on hour three in here,

02:11.327 --> 02:13.295
I thought she should know.

02:13.329 --> 02:14.563
Mom and dad have
a lot to worry about

02:14.597 --> 02:16.064
with grandpa right now.

02:16.097 --> 02:18.067
I don't want them coming
back for some bullshit,

02:18.100 --> 02:19.536
because you made
them worry about me.

02:19.569 --> 02:21.036
I don't think you have
to worry about that,

02:21.070 --> 02:22.339
they're pretty busy up there.

02:23.139 --> 02:24.106
Oh.

02:28.144 --> 02:30.080
Hey, you hungry?

02:30.113 --> 02:31.582
Want to get a Pronto Pup?

02:31.616 --> 02:32.417
Yeah.

02:32.450 --> 02:35.018
Pronto Pup, Pronto Pup,
Pronto Pup!

02:37.187 --> 02:40.123
Hey, imagine retirement.

02:42.494 --> 02:43.961
You're still in college.

02:45.531 --> 02:47.533
No, it's something
to look forward to.

02:49.635 --> 02:50.903
- I want to leave.
- Hmm?

02:50.935 --> 02:51.804
I want to leave.

02:51.837 --> 02:53.171
Wait wait, that's on a movie.

02:53.204 --> 02:54.173
No no, there's a bunch
of guys sitting around,

02:54.206 --> 02:55.608
they just graduated college.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.075
And one of them says,

02:57.109 --> 02:59.144
"I wish I was retiring
after years of hard labor."

02:59.178 --> 02:59.978
Charlie let's walk to the car.

03:00.012 --> 03:01.180
Wait wait, what is it?

03:02.181 --> 03:03.516
No, I,

03:03.550 --> 03:05.083
God this is gonna
bother me all day.

03:05.117 --> 03:06.520
Come on, Charlie,
I'm not.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.556
God, what is it?

03:09.989 --> 03:11.425
Okay, I'm leaving.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.258
Hannah.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.159
Hannah!

04:20.367 --> 04:22.034
Hey.

04:22.067 --> 04:22.903
Yeah.

04:24.203 --> 04:25.137
Yeah.

04:27.239 --> 04:28.642
How's he doing?

04:29.576 --> 04:32.145
God, that's, that's awful.

04:35.383 --> 04:36.817
Yeah, we can head up tomorrow.

04:37.952 --> 04:38.753
Okay.

04:38.786 --> 04:39.820
Yeah, I love you too.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.057
Mom?

04:43.090 --> 04:44.091
Yeah.

04:44.125 --> 04:45.259
Grandpa's in the hospital.

04:46.428 --> 04:47.429
Damn.

04:49.464 --> 04:51.934
She wants us
to go up as soon as we can.

04:51.967 --> 04:53.435
Gotta get work off.

04:53.468 --> 04:54.470
Me too.

04:57.907 --> 04:59.207
Is he gonna be all right?

04:59.241 --> 05:00.276
We'll see.

05:05.147 --> 05:06.215
He'll probably die.

05:06.249 --> 05:07.318
Don't say that.

05:07.351 --> 05:08.151
It's true.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.421
He's old and in the hospital,

05:10.454 --> 05:11.989
and all of my friends'
grandparents are already dead,

05:12.022 --> 05:13.057
so it's only a matter of time.

05:13.089 --> 05:14.257
He could pull through.

05:15.091 --> 05:17.294
No, no.

05:17.328 --> 05:18.330
Come on.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.303
I quit being so optimistic.

05:25.337 --> 05:26.338
What's wrong with optimism?

05:28.373 --> 05:30.309
Charlie, think of it this way.

05:30.343 --> 05:32.445
What if you set a cookie
next to a hungry dog,

05:32.478 --> 05:34.680
and then you told me that
I could have the cookie.

05:34.714 --> 05:37.316
In fact, this cookie was mine.

05:37.350 --> 05:38.684
The only reason I
wouldn't have the cookie

05:38.718 --> 05:40.920
was if it was eaten
by the hungry dog.

05:40.953 --> 05:43.357
I would probably
be confused because

05:43.390 --> 05:45.325
you're so confident that
I would get this cookie,

05:45.359 --> 05:48.428
but the hungry dog is
right, right there.

05:48.462 --> 05:49.930
Grandpa's the cookie?

05:49.963 --> 05:51.965
The cookie's a metaphor for
all unrealistic expectations.

05:51.999 --> 05:54.302
So grandpa's life?

05:54.335 --> 05:55.470
Fine, grandpa's the cookie.

05:55.503 --> 05:56.471
You know, we could
make this a fun trip.

05:56.504 --> 05:57.538
We could pack the camping gear.

05:57.572 --> 05:59.139
No, I hate camping,
we're not going camping.

05:59.172 --> 06:00.308
Camping's fun.

06:00.341 --> 06:02.209
Camping is literally
Satan as an activity.

06:02.242 --> 06:03.945
Oh come one, we could
go to Tahquamenon.

06:03.978 --> 06:04.946
Oh, shut up.

06:09.385 --> 06:11.387
No, shut up, I got
to get work off.

06:12.388 --> 06:14.289
I'm sorry.

06:14.323 --> 06:16.358
Oh, it's all
right, I'll be fine.

06:16.392 --> 06:18.294
He was getting pretty old.

06:18.328 --> 06:22.399
No, I'm sorry but I
cannot let you leave.

06:22.432 --> 06:24.467
Oh, excuse me?

06:24.501 --> 06:26.403
Have you found someone
to cover your shift?

06:26.436 --> 06:28.405
It's such short notice.

06:28.438 --> 06:29.807
It is.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.575
I'm sorry, Lady, but
this is a family emergency.

06:31.609 --> 06:33.344
Did you just call her lady?

06:34.177 --> 06:35.880
Oh no.

06:35.913 --> 06:37.481
Yes, but that's
actually her name.

06:37.515 --> 06:40.317
Don't talk to our
customers like that, Hannah.

06:40.351 --> 06:41.385
Jesus.

06:41.419 --> 06:42.688
Don't take the
Lord's name in vain.

06:42.721 --> 06:44.823
Listen Lady,
I've enjoyed working here

06:44.856 --> 06:47.059
but this is a family emergency.

06:47.092 --> 06:50.295
We've tried to foster a
family for you right here.

06:53.733 --> 06:54.701
Okay, I'm out.

07:05.578 --> 07:07.681
You get work off?

07:07.715 --> 07:08.515
No.

07:08.549 --> 07:09.416
No?

07:10.584 --> 07:13.654
No, I either quit or was
fired, I'm not quite sure.

07:16.890 --> 07:18.326
You got everything in here?

07:22.931 --> 07:25.300
What time should we
leave tomorrow, nine, 10?

07:26.301 --> 07:27.736
Let's do 10.

07:28.235 --> 07:29.504
Come on, we should
get some sleep.

08:04.542 --> 08:05.476
Howdy.

08:07.346 --> 08:08.680
Renting a kayak?

08:08.714 --> 08:09.715
Yeah.

08:10.516 --> 08:11.617
Have fun.

08:11.650 --> 08:12.718
Thanks.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.164
Tyler, listen to me.

08:24.197 --> 08:26.166
I don't want to talk to you,
I don't want to see you.

08:26.199 --> 08:27.667
You need to leave me alone.

08:44.719 --> 08:46.488
What are you
putting back there?

08:46.521 --> 08:48.824
Oh, I just forgot to
pack something last night.

09:00.036 --> 09:01.404
Tina's a bitch.

09:02.505 --> 09:03.339
Who's Tina?

09:05.274 --> 09:06.577
My best friend.

09:06.610 --> 09:07.811
Oh yeah, Tina.

09:07.845 --> 09:09.046
No, I got ya.

09:10.447 --> 09:12.249
You don't remember
Tina, do you?

09:13.884 --> 09:14.885
No.

09:16.019 --> 09:17.421
Never mind.

09:17.454 --> 09:18.823
Well, hold on, just
because I don't know Tina

09:18.857 --> 09:21.860
doesn't mean I can't recognize
if she's being a bitch.

09:21.893 --> 09:22.994
You're not friends with Tina.

09:23.027 --> 09:25.263
You're not allowed to
talk shit about her.

09:25.296 --> 09:27.165
Okay, well what'd she do?

09:27.198 --> 09:28.833
She's just giving me hell

09:28.867 --> 09:31.737
about not being able to
hang out this weekend.

09:31.770 --> 09:35.374
Because you're visiting
your dying relative?

09:35.407 --> 09:36.242
Yes.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.510
Does she not understand?

09:38.544 --> 09:39.411
She's not great at picking up

09:39.445 --> 09:41.247
on other people's existences.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.089
You said, "dying relative."

09:51.491 --> 09:54.762
No, I said dying,
I didn't say going to die.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.963
That's the exact same thing.

09:55.997 --> 09:57.231
There's literally no difference

09:57.265 --> 09:59.033
between dying and going to die.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.701
There is totally a difference,

10:00.735 --> 10:03.437
one is much more
definitive than the other.

10:07.809 --> 10:09.645
Stop it.

10:09.678 --> 10:11.446
Just turn off your phone.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.614
I've tried.

10:12.648 --> 10:13.815
It's not a permanent solution.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.885
When have you tried?

10:16.919 --> 10:19.455
Every time I go to the
movies or church or take a nap.

10:20.523 --> 10:22.058
Church?

10:22.091 --> 10:23.459
Yeah, you shouldn't have
your phone on in church.

10:23.493 --> 10:24.827
When do you go to church?

10:25.929 --> 10:28.932
Oh, I see, thank
you for the judgment.

10:28.965 --> 10:30.601
No, I'm not judging you.

10:30.634 --> 10:32.670
You can believe in whatever
you want, I don't care.

10:32.703 --> 10:33.804
If you really believe that

10:33.837 --> 10:35.472
you wouldn't have
reacted that way.

10:40.110 --> 10:41.111
Okay, I see it.

10:41.145 --> 10:43.281
Now you're judging
me, for judging you.

10:43.316 --> 10:45.483
Now you're judging
me for judging you.

10:45.517 --> 10:46.484
What?

10:46.518 --> 10:47.919
You know, the
river runs both ways.

10:47.953 --> 10:50.121
That's definitely not
how the expression goes.

10:50.155 --> 10:51.424
It's not even possible.

10:56.495 --> 10:57.863
You want to make a stop?

11:00.733 --> 11:01.734
Sure.

11:46.549 --> 11:48.718
Hey, what do you think?

11:49.719 --> 11:50.954
Okay, Mister Rogers.

11:52.088 --> 11:54.925
No, Mister Rogers
wears cardigans.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.260
They're not the same.

12:01.732 --> 12:02.733
Selsun Blue.

12:03.601 --> 12:04.702
What?

12:04.735 --> 12:05.704
Yeah, that's what your
sweater reminds me of,

12:05.737 --> 12:07.739
a bottle of Selsun Blue.

12:07.773 --> 12:10.343
The dandruff shampoo?

12:10.376 --> 12:11.377
Yes.

12:13.745 --> 12:15.881
My sweater reminds
you of dandruff?

12:15.914 --> 12:17.215
No, dandruff shampoo.

12:18.951 --> 12:19.952
Thank you.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.088
It looks like an art project,

12:22.121 --> 12:24.724
but one that the
parents were like,

12:24.757 --> 12:28.362
and then they like threw
it away immediately.

12:33.801 --> 12:35.235
What was that?

12:53.656 --> 12:55.157
I'm calling a tow truck.

13:02.798 --> 13:03.799
It's all there.

13:14.010 --> 13:14.811
What's going on?

13:14.845 --> 13:16.880
Well, too many cars.

13:18.716 --> 13:20.284
They can't get to
us till tomorrow.

13:20.319 --> 13:22.186
Then we should take
our car somewhere else.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.855
Oh cool, do you want
to start the car up

13:23.888 --> 13:24.856
and take it to another shop?

13:24.889 --> 13:25.823
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:25.857 --> 13:27.392
Did you have any suggestions?

13:28.826 --> 13:30.829
Do you have any friends
that live around here?

13:30.863 --> 13:32.197
Where are we?

13:32.231 --> 13:33.466
Thompsonville.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.299
Thompsonville?

13:34.334 --> 13:35.701
Yeah.

13:35.734 --> 13:38.103
What the hell is
in Thompsonville?

13:38.137 --> 13:38.937
A ski resort.

13:38.971 --> 13:39.771
Great idea.

13:39.805 --> 13:41.039
Let's hit the slopes mid-July

13:41.073 --> 13:42.675
and break all four
of our ankles.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.612
Maybe there's a campsite.

13:44.644 --> 13:45.446
Shit.

13:45.479 --> 13:46.614
What?

13:46.646 --> 13:47.448
You don't actually
want to camp.

13:47.481 --> 13:48.314
I do.

13:48.415 --> 13:49.182
No you don't.

13:49.215 --> 13:50.316
I do.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.317
Go away.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.954
Oh my God, I do.

13:53.988 --> 13:55.022
- I do.
- Go away.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.512
You coming?

14:46.545 --> 14:47.613
Yeah.

14:51.483 --> 14:53.786
Is it bigger than a bread box?

14:53.819 --> 14:54.621
What?

14:54.654 --> 14:55.888
I don't know.

14:55.921 --> 14:57.256
It's one of those
questions they used to ask

14:57.289 --> 14:58.891
on those little
electronic things.

14:58.924 --> 15:03.295
- It is about exactly
the size of a breadbox.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.431
About exactly.

15:04.464 --> 15:07.468
Exactly, it is exactly
the size of a bread box.

15:07.501 --> 15:08.436
Is it a bread box?

15:08.469 --> 15:09.936
Yeah.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.238
What the hell?

15:11.271 --> 15:12.540
What?

15:12.573 --> 15:13.541
Why would you
choose a bread box?

15:13.574 --> 15:14.609
It's what they used to ask

15:14.642 --> 15:15.643
on those little
electronic things.

15:15.676 --> 15:17.110
Oh my God.

15:17.143 --> 15:19.481
What? What?

15:47.444 --> 15:49.178
Stop fucking calling me.

15:50.648 --> 15:51.515
What was that?

15:52.616 --> 15:53.652
Tyler.

15:54.519 --> 15:55.953
Tyler, Tyler?

15:56.120 --> 15:58.623
That's the one.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.725
I thought you guys
stopped talking.

16:03.227 --> 16:05.564
I stopped talking,
he never shut up.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.367
I'm sorry.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.834
It's okay.

16:11.836 --> 16:13.238
It's just,

16:14.340 --> 16:15.641
he's such a nobody.

16:17.075 --> 16:18.679
What does that mean?

16:21.213 --> 16:23.617
He just gets so
jealous of everyone.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.553
He obsesses over anyone who
can do anything better than him.

16:28.689 --> 16:30.358
Sorry you dated a shit
head.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.761
It's okay.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.898
Tyler sucks for a
thousand reasons.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.967
Yeah, he was
possessive and annoying.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.904
Yeah, but he was
also just stupid.

16:49.110 --> 16:52.880
Whenever I tried to talk
to him about bigger things

16:52.914 --> 16:53.783
he just got bored.

16:54.917 --> 16:56.018
Big things?

16:56.051 --> 16:57.052
Yeah.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.356
How so?

17:00.189 --> 17:04.594
Art, politics,
religion, existence.

17:05.929 --> 17:07.765
Those are big things.

17:10.401 --> 17:11.702
Tyler was annoying,

17:11.736 --> 17:14.070
but at least he
wasn't a big thing.

17:16.374 --> 17:17.975
Yeah, there's the bright side.

17:18.943 --> 17:19.944
Yeah.

17:21.946 --> 17:23.548
Want to set up this tent?

17:27.819 --> 17:29.221
Come on.

17:29.254 --> 17:33.393
Oh no.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.295
This is definitely
not a camp site.

17:37.329 --> 17:39.832
It is a site
where we can camp.

17:50.176 --> 17:51.177
Charlie?

17:53.113 --> 17:54.582
Yeah?

17:54.616 --> 17:56.950
I know you're not gonna
admit that grandpa might die.

17:56.984 --> 17:59.920
But hypothetically, say he does.

18:03.090 --> 18:04.992
Okay.

18:05.026 --> 18:06.629
Doesn't it freak you out?

18:12.167 --> 18:13.903
I guess, a little.

18:13.935 --> 18:18.842
One second he's our grandpa
and the next he's a corpse.

18:20.009 --> 18:23.045
So I don't know, doesn't
that make you uncomfortable?

18:25.615 --> 18:26.483
Sure, yeah.

18:32.523 --> 18:34.592
So you're pretty indifferent
towards grandpa's death.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.495
What? No, no,
I wouldn't say that.

18:37.528 --> 18:39.029
Then what would you say?

18:40.898 --> 18:42.701
I mean, everybody dies
eventually, you know?

18:42.734 --> 18:45.036
And, and then life moves on.

18:48.072 --> 18:50.141
It, it just does.

18:52.076 --> 18:55.047
So you could move on just
fine after a relative dies?

18:59.919 --> 19:01.387
I guess.

19:01.421 --> 19:02.422
I mean.

19:03.890 --> 19:06.025
You know, once you've been
around for enough deaths,

19:06.059 --> 19:07.227
and you reach a certain age.

19:07.260 --> 19:08.261
What, 22?

19:09.830 --> 19:12.366
Yeah, these four years
make a huge difference.

19:12.399 --> 19:13.199
You don't even know.

19:13.233 --> 19:14.435
You're so pretentious.

19:15.603 --> 19:17.004
I'm not pretentious.

19:17.037 --> 19:17.873
Yes you are, the
way you said that.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.073
You said that pretentiously.

19:19.106 --> 19:22.677
You can't say something
pretentiously.

19:22.711 --> 19:24.011
There, you just did it again.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.386
How's college?

19:30.419 --> 19:31.253
College?

19:32.254 --> 19:35.056
College is fun.

19:36.224 --> 19:37.426
Philosophy is?

19:39.294 --> 19:42.164
No, I switched
out of Philosophy.

19:42.198 --> 19:43.199
To?

19:44.735 --> 19:45.969
English.

19:46.970 --> 19:48.237
But?

19:48.271 --> 19:52.944
But English is
just as useless.

19:57.314 --> 19:58.750
Well, shit.

19:59.484 --> 20:00.385
I know.

20:01.318 --> 20:03.086
What are you gonna do?

20:04.321 --> 20:08.928
Well, I could write,
or I could be a teacher,

20:08.961 --> 20:10.563
but I don't really feel
like going to grad school

20:10.596 --> 20:12.297
and burying myself in debt.

20:13.999 --> 20:14.900
Are you writing?

20:16.301 --> 20:17.737
Trying.

20:19.138 --> 20:20.139
Cool.

20:21.173 --> 20:23.142
Do you want to ask
me about my life?

20:25.946 --> 20:28.247
You said that
very pretentiously.

20:32.252 --> 20:34.087
How's your life?

20:39.026 --> 20:40.461
It's fine.

20:43.331 --> 20:45.166
Okay.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.315
Why do you do that?

21:00.349 --> 21:01.684
Do what?

21:01.718 --> 21:03.185
Whenever you asked
what's going on with me,

21:03.218 --> 21:05.456
and I say nothing,
you say, okay.

21:08.993 --> 21:10.159
I don't know, I mean,

21:11.795 --> 21:14.398
you know what's going on with
you better than anybody else.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.037
But you don't even pry.

21:20.472 --> 21:22.374
Do you want me to pry?

21:22.407 --> 21:27.012
No, I just I want you to care.

21:27.045 --> 21:28.278
I do care.

21:28.312 --> 21:29.548
I just don't want to
bug you about stuff

21:29.582 --> 21:31.083
you don't want to talk about.

21:32.585 --> 21:34.319
It's okay, it's fair.

21:42.328 --> 21:45.164
Is there something
you want to talk about?

21:50.370 --> 21:51.772
Okay.

21:54.341 --> 21:55.777
Do you believe in a God?

21:58.379 --> 21:59.781
Not really.

22:02.282 --> 22:03.183
Do you believe in

22:04.385 --> 22:05.387
anything?

22:09.357 --> 22:10.224
I don't know.

22:14.563 --> 22:15.564
Do you?

22:27.110 --> 22:28.545
Who knows?

22:33.484 --> 22:34.618
Well, you do.

22:43.227 --> 22:44.196
I'm gonna get sleep?

22:44.228 --> 22:45.764
Lame-ah.

22:45.797 --> 22:47.364
- What?
- You're lame.

22:47.399 --> 22:48.400
You were the one who wanted
to camp in the first place.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.635
At least stay awake to enjoy it.

22:50.669 --> 22:54.807
You know that word is
offensive to actual lame people.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.375
It's an outdated word.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.811
There are always gonna
be people who can't walk.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.482
Lame.

23:07.621 --> 23:11.458
I'm gonna go to sleep.

23:36.652 --> 23:38.353
I thought you
were going to bed?

23:39.455 --> 23:40.489
I am.

23:49.466 --> 23:50.700
Good morning.

23:54.472 --> 23:55.373
Good morning.

23:57.542 --> 23:58.509
Morning.

23:58.543 --> 24:00.343
What?

24:00.378 --> 24:02.013
I went to see the sunrise.

24:03.481 --> 24:04.515
Why?

24:05.517 --> 24:08.220
Because it's beautiful.

24:08.253 --> 24:09.320
Let me sleep.

24:09.353 --> 24:10.756
Come on.

24:11.023 --> 24:12.624
No.

24:12.658 --> 24:14.893
Come on, time to get up.

24:14.927 --> 24:16.395
No.

24:16.428 --> 24:17.864
Why?

24:19.032 --> 24:20.433
Because.

24:21.167 --> 24:22.569
That's a fake answer.

24:22.602 --> 24:24.637
I'm really comfortable
right here, thank you.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.472
Why are you acting like this?

24:26.506 --> 24:27.874
Because it doesn't
matter if I wake up

24:27.907 --> 24:30.511
now or later or
tomorrow or never.

24:30.544 --> 24:32.112
Come on, we gotta
go get the car.

24:34.381 --> 24:35.482
And we got to get
back on the road.

24:35.516 --> 24:36.917
Why?

24:36.951 --> 24:38.652
If the car didn't break
down, we'd be there already.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.353
Okay, but the
car did break down

24:40.387 --> 24:41.556
and we're already put behind.

24:41.590 --> 24:43.258
So what's it matter if you
let me sleep a little longer?

24:43.291 --> 24:44.526
It's nine o'clock,

24:44.559 --> 24:46.895
that's a totally
reasonable time to wake up.

24:46.928 --> 24:49.064
Normal people don't wake
up earlier than they have to,

24:49.097 --> 24:50.498
to watch the sunrise.

24:50.532 --> 24:53.236
It was beautiful and awesome,
and you should have come.

24:53.269 --> 24:55.037
Charlie, do you know that
the pretty colors in the sky

24:55.071 --> 24:57.039
are caused by pollutants
in our atmosphere?

24:57.073 --> 24:58.841
So the same thing
that's killing all of us

24:58.875 --> 25:00.409
and ruining all of our futures,

25:00.443 --> 25:02.044
is what caused those
pretty sky colors

25:02.078 --> 25:03.880
that you just got
so excited about.

25:05.916 --> 25:08.085
No, I didn't.

25:08.118 --> 25:08.952
Fuck Charlie!

25:12.456 --> 25:13.490
What is it?

25:16.560 --> 25:17.562
I'm tired.

25:27.639 --> 25:29.575
Let's go take down this tent.

26:00.441 --> 26:01.542
I can't do this anymore.

26:03.611 --> 26:04.613
Do what?

26:09.217 --> 26:10.652
I just,

26:13.288 --> 26:16.793
I don't want to carry all
these supplies back to the car.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.495
Can I just pack up here and go?

26:22.832 --> 26:24.233
Sure.

26:39.850 --> 26:41.519
Nope.

26:41.553 --> 26:42.721
Not ready yet.

26:42.754 --> 26:43.688
Really?

26:43.722 --> 26:44.756
Yeah.

26:45.824 --> 26:48.461
Okay, when will it be ready?

26:48.493 --> 26:49.828
I don't know,

26:49.861 --> 26:51.863
but I can offer you some
water in the meantime.

27:02.675 --> 27:03.943
A plastic water bottle?

27:12.386 --> 27:13.787
Yup.

27:15.522 --> 27:18.559
You know, these things
are killing our planet.

27:22.897 --> 27:24.799
Are you thirsty
or are you not?

27:57.469 --> 27:59.003
Do you have a recycling bin?

28:00.738 --> 28:02.039
If you don't have
a recycling bin,

28:02.073 --> 28:04.943
I'm gonna take this elsewhere
and recycle it myself.

28:06.244 --> 28:07.312
I don't have a bin.

28:08.747 --> 28:10.248
Your car'll be ready at four.

30:01.735 --> 30:03.137
Where
did you get a gun?

30:05.740 --> 30:07.142
I bought it.

30:08.243 --> 30:09.244
How?

30:11.947 --> 30:13.248
It's an antique.

30:15.917 --> 30:16.852
What does that?

30:16.886 --> 30:18.287
There's loopholes.

30:21.224 --> 30:22.258
Okay.

30:41.447 --> 30:42.814
Don't tell mom.

30:42.847 --> 30:43.948
- I'm telling mom.
- Don't tell mom,

30:43.982 --> 30:45.584
it was an episode, it
won't happen again.

30:47.185 --> 30:48.953
It was clearly premeditated.

30:48.987 --> 30:50.255
It's over, don't tell mom.

30:59.466 --> 31:01.300
So what are we
gonna do with it?

31:02.636 --> 31:03.936
I don't know.

31:07.374 --> 31:08.375
Google it.

31:09.610 --> 31:10.910
We Google it?

31:10.944 --> 31:11.945
Yep.

31:13.847 --> 31:17.885
Okay, I don't know what.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.389
Hey Google, how do I
dispose of a firearm?

31:22.890 --> 31:24.058
Okay, yeah, got it.

31:30.399 --> 31:33.302
Okay, this says
deactivate firearm

31:33.335 --> 31:34.737
and turn it into art.

31:37.039 --> 31:38.040
What?

31:39.542 --> 31:41.010
No, sorry sorry, that's it.

31:42.178 --> 31:43.547
How do we deactivate it?

31:43.580 --> 31:45.014
What's so funny?

31:46.684 --> 31:49.520
Well, why does the article
suggest turning it into art?

31:49.553 --> 31:50.654
Why not just deactivate it?

31:50.688 --> 31:52.356
Oh my God, send a
letter to the author.

31:52.389 --> 31:54.224
I don't know.

31:57.061 --> 31:58.028
Cement.

31:58.062 --> 31:59.531
Cement?

31:59.564 --> 32:01.599
We deactivate this gun
by pouring cement into it.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.936
Then let's go get cement.

32:06.404 --> 32:08.039
Okay, I'll find
a hardware store.

32:09.374 --> 32:11.477
How long till
our car is ready?

32:11.510 --> 32:12.377
Two hours.

32:13.512 --> 32:14.412
Yikes.

32:14.447 --> 32:17.917
Okay, we can find an ATM and

32:18.951 --> 32:20.420
head into town in the meantime.

32:24.123 --> 32:26.025
This is staying with me.

32:26.892 --> 32:28.295
Fine.

32:31.965 --> 32:34.000
Hey, hey, I love you.

32:34.034 --> 32:35.035
Oh gross, cooties.

32:37.472 --> 32:39.039
What the hell?

32:39.072 --> 32:40.173
What?

32:40.208 --> 32:42.076
Why aren't you
taking this seriously?

32:43.479 --> 32:45.781
Charlie, let me take this
however I want to take it.

32:48.584 --> 32:50.051
- Shit!
- What?

32:50.084 --> 32:51.886
- Shit!
- What?

32:51.919 --> 32:53.757
What's wrong?

32:56.125 --> 32:57.494
My book is ruined.

33:00.162 --> 33:02.131
I mean, you dropped
it in the water.

33:02.164 --> 33:04.300
I didn't think I
would need it anymore.

33:10.273 --> 33:11.274
Right.

33:16.947 --> 33:18.015
We should go.

34:43.007 --> 34:45.209
Check out the dune.

34:47.913 --> 34:48.847
Wanna check them out?

35:04.598 --> 35:07.601
Do you want to talk
about something?

35:11.972 --> 35:13.072
Sure.

35:13.106 --> 35:15.743
Do you want to talk about?

35:16.545 --> 35:17.946
No.

35:21.115 --> 35:23.552
Then, what do you
want to talk about?

35:27.121 --> 35:28.791
Name something.

35:28.824 --> 35:29.892
Okay.

35:33.128 --> 35:36.933
What about human rights?

35:36.966 --> 35:39.435
No, greeting cards.

35:39.468 --> 35:42.238
I feel like birthday
cards are kind of fake.

35:42.271 --> 35:43.974
I appreciate a birthday card.

35:44.007 --> 35:45.207
Sure, okay,

35:45.241 --> 35:47.310
but then you set it down and
you completely forget about it.

35:47.343 --> 35:49.813
Yeah, but that's
all greeting cards.

35:51.682 --> 35:54.018
Do you dislike
every greeting card?

35:55.853 --> 35:56.788
I don't know.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.255
What about sympathy cards?

35:58.288 --> 35:59.323
Those are the worst.

35:59.356 --> 36:00.825
Why?

36:00.858 --> 36:03.327
Well, I feel like every
time someone gives you an

36:03.360 --> 36:04.964
I'm sorry for your loss' card.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.066
That's the last
time the card-giver

36:07.098 --> 36:08.801
will ever acknowledge your loss.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.103
That's dark.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.276
So what, you don't like
any kind of greeting cards?

36:20.513 --> 36:21.413
Halloween,

36:21.448 --> 36:23.148
and Saint Patrick's Day.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.952
Why those?

36:25.986 --> 36:27.186
Because there's never
really an obligation

36:27.219 --> 36:30.658
to give someone a card on
a stupid holiday like that.

36:30.691 --> 36:33.159
Okay yeah, yeah,
I like that answer.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.497
Thanks.

36:42.504 --> 36:43.639
Pancakes.

36:59.022 --> 37:00.056
I'm gonna miss grandpa.

37:01.491 --> 37:03.626
He's not dead.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.395
He might as well be.

37:09.399 --> 37:10.901
I'm full.

37:10.934 --> 37:12.670
I'm not hungry,
do you want some?

37:12.703 --> 37:13.671
What?

37:13.704 --> 37:15.139
Excuse me, can we get a box?

37:15.171 --> 37:17.142
- Oh, and the bill.
- Sure.

37:17.174 --> 37:18.242
I haven't even got my food.

37:18.275 --> 37:20.011
Oh, sorry right,
make that two boxes.

37:20.045 --> 37:21.046
Sorry.

37:21.079 --> 37:22.212
Why are we leaving?

37:22.246 --> 37:24.248
I don't like eating in
front of.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.117
Hannah.

37:58.753 --> 37:59.554
Stay here.

37:59.587 --> 38:00.455
What?

38:00.488 --> 38:01.923
Stay here.

38:04.460 --> 38:06.895
Hey, hey Tyler.

38:06.929 --> 38:08.097
Oh, hey Hannah.

38:08.130 --> 38:09.430
What are you doing here?

38:10.398 --> 38:11.467
What am I doing here?

38:11.500 --> 38:13.202
Yeah, this is crazy.

38:13.234 --> 38:14.770
Tyler, are you following me?

38:21.010 --> 38:21.811
Are you following my sister?

38:21.845 --> 38:22.946
What, no.

38:22.979 --> 38:24.279
Do you like
terrorizing your exes?

38:24.313 --> 38:25.280
The hell man, I'm not-

38:25.314 --> 38:26.483
Go back home.

38:27.316 --> 38:28.819
Or watch me dial 9-1-1.

39:03.288 --> 39:07.694
Hey, thanks.

39:07.728 --> 39:08.862
No problem.

39:16.738 --> 39:18.438
Was that why?

39:18.473 --> 39:19.406
No.

39:23.011 --> 39:25.312
Part of it, maybe,
subconsciously.

39:29.151 --> 39:30.986
I'm sorry you had
to deal with that.

39:33.889 --> 39:35.323
It's okay.

39:39.863 --> 39:43.266
I doubt we'll see
him around anymore.

39:45.401 --> 39:46.368
Yeah, me too.

39:48.205 --> 39:49.840
Let's get out of
here, I'm burning.

39:57.782 --> 39:58.583
I'm going to the bathroom.

39:58.616 --> 40:00.051
Go for it.

40:07.893 --> 40:09.294
Hey mom.

40:54.477 --> 40:58.114
Yeah, that Tyler, he had
followed us all the way there.

41:01.617 --> 41:04.321
No, I don't know how long
he'd been following us.

41:05.489 --> 41:07.925
Yeah yeah, she said it might
be part of the reason why.

41:08.692 --> 41:10.127
Why what?

41:13.964 --> 41:15.365
Why what?

41:16.167 --> 41:17.101
Why what Charlie?

41:17.135 --> 41:19.470
Part of the reason why what?

43:26.607 --> 43:27.943
It's hard to
believe that space

43:27.976 --> 43:30.612
just keeps going
and going and going.

43:34.950 --> 43:36.985
What was that?

43:40.290 --> 43:41.691
Hello?

43:46.863 --> 43:47.764
Hi.

43:47.797 --> 43:48.998
Is there something
you need or?

43:49.032 --> 43:51.702
Sorry, I just have
no idea where I am.

43:52.837 --> 43:56.674
Okay, well you're in Leland.

43:56.707 --> 43:57.808
Leland, okay.

43:57.842 --> 43:59.743
Do you need to borrow
a phone or something?

43:59.777 --> 44:00.778
Oh no, I have one.

44:00.811 --> 44:02.980
I'm just trying to get
my bearings, thanks.

44:04.883 --> 44:06.718
Are you a nomad?

44:07.018 --> 44:11.690
Yes, I am a nomad actually,
but all of my gear was stolen.

44:11.723 --> 44:13.091
Whoa.

44:13.125 --> 44:14.826
Who took your gear?

44:14.860 --> 44:18.664
I was hitchhiking and
the driver, he was crazy.

44:18.698 --> 44:21.667
He pulled over and he kicked
me out and took all my gear.

44:22.835 --> 44:24.170
That is so screwed up.

44:28.375 --> 44:29.544
You want to warm up?

44:30.844 --> 44:31.912
Yeah.

44:43.492 --> 44:46.127
So like, what are
you do in the winters?

44:46.161 --> 44:46.995
Huh?

44:47.028 --> 44:49.731
You know, middle of January.

44:49.764 --> 44:51.032
What do you do so you
don't freeze to death?

44:51.065 --> 44:53.702
Well, usually I have a
backpack full of blankets

44:53.736 --> 44:55.738
and a portable heater.

44:55.771 --> 44:59.942
But well, I'll have to rethink
my stance on hitchhiking.

45:02.878 --> 45:06.016
You are easily the coolest
fucking person I've ever met.

45:07.384 --> 45:08.685
What?

45:08.718 --> 45:09.853
Is she not?

45:09.886 --> 45:11.589
I think she's pretty cool.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.094
You always been a nomad?

45:18.963 --> 45:20.599
I mean, kind of.

45:20.632 --> 45:22.733
Where are your parents?

45:22.767 --> 45:24.769
My parents were nomads but,

45:26.070 --> 45:29.775
they moved to Florida
for the warm weather.

45:29.808 --> 45:31.944
So did my grandparents.

45:31.977 --> 45:35.414
And I wanted to stay,
so I did.

45:35.447 --> 45:37.049
Do you have any other family?

45:38.417 --> 45:39.852
No.

45:39.886 --> 45:41.888
I can't imagine
that lifestyle.

45:42.755 --> 45:44.157
I'm used to it.

45:44.424 --> 45:45.725
Sounds like it.

45:49.229 --> 45:52.833
So, what's the craziest thing
that's ever happened to you?

45:57.505 --> 46:00.675
I ran from a bear once.

46:01.976 --> 46:02.876
No way.

46:02.910 --> 46:03.878
Yeah.

46:03.912 --> 46:04.813
Where?

46:04.846 --> 46:06.616
Somewhere deep in the woods.

46:06.649 --> 46:09.818
I had left my campsite
to go to the bathroom.

46:09.851 --> 46:11.886
And when I came
back there was this

46:11.920 --> 46:14.923
huge black bear with its
head buried in my tent.

46:16.158 --> 46:18.327
I spotted it from like
a hundred feet away.

46:18.361 --> 46:20.763
And I was about to back away,

46:21.998 --> 46:24.967
but there was this
book I was reading,

46:26.936 --> 46:30.140
a book my parents had given
to me before they left,

46:30.173 --> 46:35.178
and I really needed this book.

46:35.979 --> 46:38.849
And so I was a little tired

46:38.882 --> 46:41.119
and probably prone
to poor judgment,

46:41.152 --> 46:44.022
but I approached the
tent to save the book,

46:44.055 --> 46:46.024
'cause well, I'm an idiot.

46:46.057 --> 46:49.260
And of course the bear took
his head out of the tent,

46:49.294 --> 46:51.229
and it just looked at me

46:52.131 --> 46:53.533
for a second

46:53.566 --> 46:56.168
and it breathed really deep

46:57.870 --> 47:00.973
and steady like,

47:04.244 --> 47:05.312
but I really wanted this book,

47:05.345 --> 47:07.881
so I clutched it and I
darted into the woods.

47:07.914 --> 47:10.651
And just as I started running,
the bear started running,

47:10.685 --> 47:14.054
and I remember thinking, I'm
gonna die, I'm gonna die.

47:15.021 --> 47:16.157
So I threw the book.

47:17.726 --> 47:18.993
What?

47:19.026 --> 47:20.328
It was a hard cover,
so it really flew.

47:20.361 --> 47:22.531
But yeah.

47:24.265 --> 47:26.200
I threw the only thing
I wanted to save.

47:29.572 --> 47:30.673
And?

47:30.707 --> 47:32.874
And the bear chased after it.

47:33.942 --> 47:35.177
And I held my breath.

47:38.280 --> 47:41.184
And I don't know if
it was a few minutes

47:41.217 --> 47:43.787
or an hour or what but,

47:44.954 --> 47:48.525
eventually I didn't
hear anything,

47:48.559 --> 47:52.296
just total silence.

47:54.131 --> 47:57.836
And I figured it was clear, so
I walked back to my campsite,

47:57.868 --> 48:00.003
which looked
virtually on touched.

48:00.037 --> 48:01.539
I was just missing my book.

48:02.940 --> 48:05.443
I almost can't believe
you were chased by a bear.

48:06.945 --> 48:08.947
Thanks, me too.

48:11.049 --> 48:12.217
I'm sorry about your stuff.

48:12.250 --> 48:14.285
Do you want to
camp here tonight?

48:14.319 --> 48:15.921
I mean,

48:15.955 --> 48:19.125
we're camping here anyway
and we have an extra hammock.

48:19.158 --> 48:19.992
- Grace?
- Right?

48:20.993 --> 48:22.361
Should we be doing that?

48:22.395 --> 48:24.263
I mean, are you
gonna use it tonight?

48:26.399 --> 48:27.869
Well, no.

48:27.901 --> 48:29.302
Great, then.

48:30.404 --> 48:31.672
You can use Jasmine's.

48:39.179 --> 48:40.616
Thanks.

48:47.021 --> 48:48.657
Hey,

48:51.259 --> 48:52.595
do you believe in astrology?

48:54.496 --> 48:55.832
No, not really.

48:57.099 --> 48:58.100
Neither do I.

48:59.803 --> 49:01.437
I'm a Pisces but I
don't really know

49:01.470 --> 49:04.374
what that means, but
it's interesting.

49:05.308 --> 49:06.376
It is.

49:07.177 --> 49:08.579
When's your birthday?

49:08.612 --> 49:09.914
January.

49:09.946 --> 49:11.047
January what?

49:12.182 --> 49:13.818
January 25th.

49:13.851 --> 49:16.353
You're in Aquarius,
that's right before Pisces.

49:16.387 --> 49:17.756
My sister's into that stuff,

49:17.789 --> 49:19.490
so I just kind of
know the dates.

49:19.524 --> 49:21.325
But you don't believe in it?

49:22.993 --> 49:23.994
No.

49:26.997 --> 49:29.000
What do you believe in?

49:30.168 --> 49:31.571
I don't really know yet.

49:34.239 --> 49:36.174
I've got a lot of time
to figure that out.

49:39.044 --> 49:43.349
Goodnight.

49:43.382 --> 49:44.383
Goodnight.

50:07.442 --> 50:08.811
Good morning.

50:08.844 --> 50:10.245
Morning.

50:10.278 --> 50:11.714
I'm gonna go wake up Scott.

50:17.854 --> 50:19.656
Wake up, wake up.

50:19.689 --> 50:21.223
Do you have any plans today?

50:21.257 --> 50:22.491
There's not much
to do around here,

50:22.526 --> 50:25.027
but we always find
something interesting.

50:25.060 --> 50:26.663
Cool, I'm good with anything.

50:26.696 --> 50:27.532
Sweet.

50:27.565 --> 50:29.065
Awesome, you're so easygoing.

50:32.435 --> 50:35.305
I'm gonna go help wake Scott
up a little bit more gently.

50:38.375 --> 50:40.546
Scott, Scott.

51:01.099 --> 51:02.100
You got 'em?

51:02.134 --> 51:03.737
Oh yeah, I got 'em.

51:09.175 --> 51:10.143
Ladies.

51:15.684 --> 51:18.285
Only the finest
brews from Michigan.

51:19.621 --> 51:21.590
Isn't your dad gonna
miss his special beer?

51:21.623 --> 51:23.157
No, he stocks up.

51:23.190 --> 51:24.659
My dad loves this kind,

51:24.693 --> 51:26.327
and he might actually
kill me if I took it.

51:29.331 --> 51:31.166
Hannah, do you like beer?

51:31.199 --> 51:32.635
Yeah.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.440
It's good.

51:38.473 --> 51:41.510
It's dark.

51:41.545 --> 51:44.047
Yeah, well that's
because it's a stout.

51:45.181 --> 51:47.017
You're 18 years old, asshole.

51:47.050 --> 51:48.752
Don't pretend you know
everything about beer.

51:48.785 --> 51:49.820
Hey, listen up.

51:49.853 --> 51:51.756
You gotta start young
so you can catch up.

51:51.789 --> 51:53.156
Catch up to who?

51:53.190 --> 51:55.225
The 47-year-old father
from the Midwest?

51:58.161 --> 51:59.262
I didn't know you were funny.

51:59.296 --> 52:01.298
I know vagabonds are
supposed to be funny.

52:47.549 --> 52:50.018
So, you ever
meet other nomads?

52:51.788 --> 52:52.822
Not really.

52:52.855 --> 52:54.791
We just pretty much
keep to ourselves.

52:56.458 --> 53:01.196
So you don't go to nomad
parties or like nomad dates?

53:02.230 --> 53:04.968
No, it's a pretty lonely life.

53:09.973 --> 53:11.407
Can I kiss you?

53:12.643 --> 53:14.243
What?

53:14.277 --> 53:17.414
Sorry, it just
sounds like you haven't

53:17.448 --> 53:18.583
kissed anyone in a while,

53:18.616 --> 53:20.384
so I figured, you
know, if I leaned in

53:20.417 --> 53:21.786
it might be really weird,

53:21.820 --> 53:23.387
but now that I'm
thinking about it,

53:23.420 --> 53:24.723
it's probably weird now.

54:25.021 --> 54:28.291
The moment we've
all been waiting for.

54:28.324 --> 54:30.027
Come on now, there you go.

54:43.008 --> 54:44.408
Hold on.

54:45.376 --> 54:47.078
So I brought this.

54:53.485 --> 54:54.519
Sorry guys.

55:01.661 --> 55:04.330
So my brother's in town,

55:04.363 --> 55:07.901
so I copped us a little treat.

55:09.036 --> 55:09.870
No way.

55:09.903 --> 55:12.239
Yes. Fucking way, Jasmine.

55:22.083 --> 55:24.919
What type of chip would you
want to be if you were a chip?

55:24.953 --> 55:26.386
A Dorito.

55:26.554 --> 55:28.090
Which type?

55:28.123 --> 55:29.925
I'm really glad I met you.

55:29.959 --> 55:31.392
Yeah, same.

55:31.426 --> 55:33.162
It's been a crazy week.

55:33.195 --> 55:34.029
Really?

55:34.063 --> 55:35.064
Yeah.

55:35.097 --> 55:36.031
How so?

55:36.065 --> 55:38.399
Just busy.

55:42.105 --> 55:42.906
Sorry.

55:42.939 --> 55:44.274
Who was that?

55:44.307 --> 55:45.374
No one.

55:45.407 --> 55:46.810
Okay.

55:49.579 --> 55:51.481
Can I kiss you again?

55:54.484 --> 55:55.920
Yeah.

56:00.224 --> 56:01.292
Just answer it.

56:02.293 --> 56:03.095
Are you sure?

56:03.128 --> 56:04.296
Yeah, seriously.

56:04.329 --> 56:05.330
Okay.

56:06.497 --> 56:07.498
Hey.

56:15.474 --> 56:17.210
Sorry about that.

56:17.243 --> 56:18.711
You're fine.

56:18.745 --> 56:19.779
Long call.

56:19.812 --> 56:20.813
Yeah.

56:22.181 --> 56:24.083
Do want to talk about it?

56:24.117 --> 56:25.417
It's fine.

56:25.450 --> 56:26.319
I don't want to bore
you with the details.

56:26.352 --> 56:27.588
It's fine, what's up?

56:32.326 --> 56:33.360
So

56:35.262 --> 56:37.598
I broke up with my
girlfriend this week.

56:37.631 --> 56:42.503
So she hasn't been, she
hasn't stopped calling me,

56:42.536 --> 56:45.106
asking things like,
what did I do wrong?

56:45.140 --> 56:47.609
And I'm just like, oh my God,
you didn't do anything wrong.

56:49.678 --> 56:50.645
Yeah.

56:55.517 --> 56:59.822
So I'm sorry, but am I
like, am I like a rebound?

57:03.226 --> 57:04.661
Kind of.

57:05.729 --> 57:06.596
Cool.

57:06.630 --> 57:07.631
- Hey, it's not.
- It's cool.

57:08.531 --> 57:09.532
Okay.

57:12.135 --> 57:15.440
So yeah, it's just
like super annoying.

57:15.472 --> 57:19.210
It's like, oh my God,
please stop calling me.

57:19.243 --> 57:20.678
Like we're done.

57:22.413 --> 57:23.848
I'm sorry.

57:24.349 --> 57:25.383
That's cool.

57:27.586 --> 57:29.021
Hey.

57:45.372 --> 57:46.673
You're it!

57:59.620 --> 58:01.922
Well, the trail doesn't loop,

58:01.956 --> 58:03.392
so maybe we should head back.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.561
I think it goes
a little farther.

58:06.595 --> 58:08.063
I have nothing to do today.

58:08.096 --> 58:09.698
I feel like we
should get back home.

58:10.966 --> 58:12.601
What do you have
to be back for?

58:18.641 --> 58:21.044
I mean, yeah sure,
we can keep going.

58:21.077 --> 58:22.245
Are you sure?

58:22.278 --> 58:23.613
Yeah.

58:23.646 --> 58:25.181
It doesn't really
seem like you want to.

58:25.214 --> 58:27.651
We could go back to my place
and watch a movie, it's just-

58:30.821 --> 58:32.389
I get it.

58:32.423 --> 58:33.590
Get what?

58:33.624 --> 58:35.292
It's cool.

58:35.325 --> 58:36.627
Babe, come on.

58:36.660 --> 58:38.262
It's not what you think.

58:38.295 --> 58:39.297
Babe?

58:39.330 --> 58:40.799
You just met this bitch.

58:40.832 --> 58:41.800
Jasmine.

58:41.833 --> 58:43.268
No, it's fine.

58:43.468 --> 58:45.070
No, it's not.

58:45.103 --> 58:46.704
I'll see you guys later.

58:46.738 --> 58:47.872
Hannah?

58:47.906 --> 58:48.907
Hannah?

58:51.444 --> 58:53.345
Are you gonna chase after her?

58:54.780 --> 58:56.615
I don't know if
she wants me to,

58:56.649 --> 58:57.551
it's just kind of

58:57.583 --> 58:58.884
- complicated.
- I'll do it.

58:58.918 --> 59:00.052
- Okay.
- Cool,

59:00.086 --> 59:01.087
but we're leaving.

59:01.120 --> 59:01.921
We are?

59:01.954 --> 59:03.123
Yes, we are.

59:03.156 --> 59:05.759
Oh, I mean, I kind of want to-

59:05.792 --> 59:06.593
No.

59:06.626 --> 59:07.594
Okay.

59:16.871 --> 59:18.673
I think they're going
back to Jasmine's.

59:21.809 --> 59:23.778
I'm so sorry about-

59:23.811 --> 59:25.213
I mean,

59:26.647 --> 59:27.483
I totally get it.

59:28.217 --> 59:29.017
It wasn't cool.

59:29.051 --> 59:30.652
But it makes sense.

59:30.686 --> 59:31.820
But it wasn't cool.

59:36.525 --> 59:37.526
Thanks.

59:38.660 --> 59:40.864
So when do you move
on to the next town

59:40.897 --> 59:41.798
or whatever you do?

59:41.831 --> 59:42.832
Grace.

59:43.900 --> 59:45.268
I figured.

59:45.301 --> 59:46.636
I figured you figured.

59:47.871 --> 59:49.806
It's a cool story though.

59:49.839 --> 59:51.242
Thanks.

59:53.878 --> 59:55.813
But you know, any of it true?

59:57.715 --> 59:58.883
No.

59:58.916 --> 1:00:00.684
Where are you from?

1:00:00.718 --> 1:00:01.719
Grand Haven?

1:00:01.752 --> 1:00:03.688
I have an aunt
that lives there.

1:00:03.722 --> 1:00:05.690
Really, small world.

1:00:05.724 --> 1:00:06.725
What does she do?

1:00:06.758 --> 1:00:08.827
She works at one of
the elementary schools.

1:00:08.860 --> 1:00:10.262
Which one?

1:00:10.662 --> 1:00:11.997
I don't know.

1:00:12.030 --> 1:00:13.732
Her name is Lindsey Fielding.

1:00:15.101 --> 1:00:16.068
I don't know her.

1:00:17.537 --> 1:00:18.804
Big world.

1:00:18.838 --> 1:00:19.805
Yeah.

1:00:19.839 --> 1:00:21.040
No, I'm down
there all the time

1:00:21.073 --> 1:00:24.977
for holidays and
reunions and stuff.

1:00:25.011 --> 1:00:26.145
You know, I'm down
there all the time

1:00:26.179 --> 1:00:27.714
because I live there.

1:00:29.850 --> 1:00:30.951
What's your number?

1:00:30.984 --> 1:00:33.220
Maybe we can meet up,
exchange bear chase stories.

1:00:34.021 --> 1:00:35.422
Here.

1:00:38.860 --> 1:00:41.362
Yikes, there are a lot
of missed calls here.

1:00:41.396 --> 1:00:43.798
Oh, that's my
brother and my mom.

1:00:44.799 --> 1:00:46.100
Is it an emergency,

1:00:46.134 --> 1:00:47.735
or are they just needy?

1:00:48.803 --> 1:00:50.371
A little bit of both?

1:00:50.405 --> 1:00:51.807
Probably.

1:00:53.943 --> 1:00:56.712
You know, I bet you,

1:00:56.745 --> 1:00:59.215
I could get Scott to
come down there with me.

1:00:59.248 --> 1:01:00.749
That won't be necessary.

1:01:02.117 --> 1:01:04.655
Okay, then we can
just meet up, hang out.

1:01:09.893 --> 1:01:11.861
Do you know the way out of here?

1:01:11.895 --> 1:01:12.896
No.

1:01:14.999 --> 1:01:17.001
But we can figure it out.

1:01:22.974 --> 1:01:24.976
Are you sure I can't
give you a ride anywhere?

1:01:26.010 --> 1:01:27.813
Yeah, I'm sure.

1:01:27.846 --> 1:01:30.782
Okay well, if you
need anything at all,

1:01:30.816 --> 1:01:33.653
or if you're ever in the area
again, you have my number.

1:01:33.686 --> 1:01:34.687
Thanks.

1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:36.822
It's been great meeting you.

1:01:38.925 --> 1:01:39.993
Oh, I have your clothes.

1:01:41.261 --> 1:01:42.795
I'm still wearing
your coverup.

1:01:42.829 --> 1:01:43.763
No no, keep it.

1:01:49.936 --> 1:01:50.771
Thanks.

1:01:53.507 --> 1:01:56.143
Well, are you sure I can't
give you a ride somewhere?

1:01:56.176 --> 1:01:57.945
Yeah, I'm sure.

1:01:59.013 --> 1:02:00.014
I'll see you around then.

1:02:00.047 --> 1:02:00.881
Okay.

1:04:41.956 --> 1:04:43.991
You scared the
living shit out of me.

1:04:44.025 --> 1:04:45.059
I know.

1:04:46.127 --> 1:04:46.929
Are you okay?

1:04:46.961 --> 1:04:47.930
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

1:04:47.962 --> 1:04:48.963
I'm fine.

1:04:49.898 --> 1:04:51.533
I was really worried.

1:04:51.567 --> 1:04:53.736
Well I'm here now,
so it's all okay.

1:04:56.472 --> 1:04:57.807
Where were you?

1:05:09.753 --> 1:05:13.122
I didn't tell mom

1:05:13.156 --> 1:05:14.390
that you were missing.

1:05:16.026 --> 1:05:17.027
What?

1:05:18.028 --> 1:05:20.164
No, I told her the
car broke down again,

1:05:20.197 --> 1:05:22.199
I blamed it on the last place.

1:05:25.402 --> 1:05:28.006
Didn't she want you
to put me on the phone?

1:05:28.039 --> 1:05:29.040
She did.

1:05:31.176 --> 1:05:33.980
I told her that you didn't
want to talk to her.

1:05:34.012 --> 1:05:35.915
I probably wouldn't have.

1:05:35.948 --> 1:05:37.617
That's what made
it believable.

1:05:40.754 --> 1:05:44.992
Well, that sounds like a
really irresponsible decision.

1:05:45.024 --> 1:05:47.059
It was, but you're here now.

1:05:47.093 --> 1:05:48.127
So, all's good.

1:05:49.295 --> 1:05:54.301
Yeah.

1:06:04.312 --> 1:06:06.949
You know I had to tell them.

1:06:06.982 --> 1:06:07.983
I know.

1:06:11.553 --> 1:06:12.554
Also,

1:06:14.891 --> 1:06:16.258
grandpa didn't make it.

1:06:31.274 --> 1:06:34.244
So there's no rush
to get there now.

1:06:40.184 --> 1:06:41.185
I guess not.

1:06:52.431 --> 1:06:54.199
Hey, good morning.

1:07:02.610 --> 1:07:05.679
I'm sorry I ran.

1:07:05.713 --> 1:07:07.213
You don't
have to apologize.

1:07:08.983 --> 1:07:09.984
I do.

1:07:11.885 --> 1:07:13.186
And, thank you.

1:07:20.561 --> 1:07:22.797
We gotta make one more stop.

1:07:32.842 --> 1:07:34.209
We gotta get rid of this.

1:07:35.645 --> 1:07:37.046
Yeah.

1:07:43.486 --> 1:07:45.421
Are we really just
gonna throw it away?

1:07:47.156 --> 1:07:49.660
Yeah, I mean it doesn't
work so it should be fine.

1:07:51.428 --> 1:07:52.396
Let's recycle it.

1:07:54.531 --> 1:07:56.067
Doesn't make any difference.

1:07:57.434 --> 1:07:59.336
It's not gonna get recycled

1:07:59.369 --> 1:08:01.639
if you just throw it
in a recycling bin.

1:08:01.673 --> 1:08:02.675
Really?

1:08:03.609 --> 1:08:04.542
Probably not.

1:08:06.679 --> 1:08:07.680
Wait.

1:08:15.922 --> 1:08:17.757
Can we, can I look
at it for a second?

1:08:22.062 --> 1:08:23.063
Sure.

1:08:42.550 --> 1:08:43.451
Okay.

1:08:43.484 --> 1:08:44.452
Okay?

1:08:44.485 --> 1:08:45.486
- All right.
- All right.

1:08:46.755 --> 1:08:48.389
You know, I think it
wouldn't have been recyclable.

1:09:27.666 --> 1:09:28.667
You ready?

1:09:31.637 --> 1:09:34.740
You know they're gonna
wanna talk about it.

1:09:34.774 --> 1:09:35.841
I know.

1:11:04.437 --> 1:11:05.605
Beautiful service.

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:08.441
Yeah.

1:11:08.474 --> 1:11:10.476
Fucking crazy week.

1:11:12.045 --> 1:11:13.446
No kidding.

1:11:15.216 --> 1:11:17.417
Still want to go camping
while we're up here?

1:11:17.451 --> 1:11:20.021
I didn't want to go
in the first place.

1:11:20.054 --> 1:11:21.055
Fair.

1:11:23.658 --> 1:11:26.461
How are you feeling?

1:11:27.897 --> 1:11:28.898
Fine.

1:11:32.067 --> 1:11:32.968
Yeah?

1:11:33.002 --> 1:11:34.069
Yeah.

1:11:35.638 --> 1:11:36.839
What did mom and dad say?

1:11:39.342 --> 1:11:40.877
What about?

1:11:40.911 --> 1:11:42.444
About you?

1:11:42.478 --> 1:11:43.280
What about me?

1:11:43.313 --> 1:11:44.281
Hannah.

1:11:46.149 --> 1:11:48.484
We're gonna try therapy,

1:11:48.517 --> 1:11:49.619
and see if that works.

1:11:50.621 --> 1:11:52.290
Probably a good move.

1:11:52.323 --> 1:11:53.590
Probably.

1:11:53.624 --> 1:11:54.859
Do you think you it will?

1:11:57.494 --> 1:11:58.696
Sure as shit hope so.

1:12:01.165 --> 1:12:02.200
Here.

1:12:04.770 --> 1:12:05.804
What is this?

1:12:05.837 --> 1:12:07.438
It's a, it's a story.

1:12:10.642 --> 1:12:13.178
Sure I can't convince
you to come camping?

1:12:15.048 --> 1:12:16.481
No way in hell.

1:12:16.515 --> 1:12:17.784
Hey, what about a
hike into Tahquamenon?

1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:21.621
All right, your loss.

1:13:38.371 --> 1:13:39.372
It's brown.

1:13:41.074 --> 1:13:43.276
Yeah, it's copper.

1:13:44.210 --> 1:13:45.745
That's what makes
the water dirty.

1:13:46.913 --> 1:13:47.914
Weird.

1:13:49.115 --> 1:13:50.151
It's natural.

1:13:54.388 --> 1:13:55.790
Like life.

1:13:56.123 --> 1:13:57.525
Hmm?

1:13:57.557 --> 1:13:59.493
It looks dirty,
but it's natural.

1:14:02.931 --> 1:14:03.932
Really?

1:14:05.566 --> 1:14:07.335
Yeah, I think so.

1:14:11.139 --> 1:14:12.573
I hope so.
