(Dot matrix printer whirs)

00:07.175 --> 00:09.610
Johnny: And, there she is!

00:09.643 --> 00:11.379
Hot off the presses!

00:11.412 --> 00:13.514
- Alexis Rose.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.116
- Why is there a line
through it?

00:15.149 --> 00:17.585
- Oh, toner must be low.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.154
- This certificate reminds me
of the one you were awarded

00:20.188 --> 00:21.822
for getting your braces off.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.657
Now that was a grand day.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.594
- Yes, except my orthodontist
had a slightly better printer.

00:26.627 --> 00:30.264
- I'm sorry, did David spend
four months earning a degree?

00:30.298 --> 00:33.101
- Alexis, we're equally proud
of you, dear.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.835
- Let's see what this says,
Alexis?

00:34.868 --> 00:40.508
Elmdale College, Alexis Rose,
majoring in Marketing and...
- (David gasps)

00:41.775 --> 00:44.112
Looks like a bit of a typo.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.747
- Pubic relations.
- What?

00:46.780 --> 00:48.316
- No.
- Oh my god, give me that!

00:48.349 --> 00:50.284
- No, honey, obviously
it's a bit a of a misprint.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.852
- Is it though, do you think?
- (Alexis grunts)

00:51.885 --> 00:54.355
- David, do not diminish your
sister's accomplishments.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.325
She didn't do anything
to your (starts laughing)

00:57.358 --> 00:59.160
I wanted to frame this!
- Hmm.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.295
(Moira laughs)
- It looks good!

01:01.329 --> 01:03.331
- (David laughs)
- (Frustrated grunt)

01:03.364 --> 01:05.166
(Moira laughs) Oh no...

01:06.334 --> 01:10.671
♪♪♪

01:11.739 --> 01:13.474
(Dog barks)

01:13.507 --> 01:16.677
- So you're wearing a leather
sweater,

01:16.710 --> 01:18.379
in the dead of summer.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.814
You look good.
- Thank you.

01:20.848 --> 01:21.882
- You look ready.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.118
- I am.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.786
- You know what you're gonna
say?

01:25.819 --> 01:28.189
- I'm gonna walk in,

01:28.222 --> 01:30.791
and I am gonna tell him
that I am,

01:30.824 --> 01:33.261
ready to get back together.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.429
- Well, that's what you said
you were gonna say to him

01:35.463 --> 01:38.832
two days ago, and yet,
here we are.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.403
- Okay, I just wanted to make
sure that I was ready, ready.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.306
You know,
for-for both of our sakes?

01:45.339 --> 01:48.709
- Mm hmm.
That's a nice bracelet.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.278
Did you get that from Patrick?

01:50.311 --> 01:52.146
- I might have.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.415
- So you waiting a full week
to forgive him

01:54.448 --> 01:56.217
has nothing to do with the fact
that he showered you

01:56.250 --> 01:58.152
with gifts and attention
every day.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.488
- That is purely coincidental!

02:00.521 --> 02:02.890
I was just working up
the strength,

02:02.923 --> 02:05.426
to be able to put our
differences aside,

02:05.459 --> 02:07.861
for the future of our
relationship.

02:07.895 --> 02:11.532
- Well, I know I lot of people
who are gonna be very excited

02:11.565 --> 02:13.934
that you guys have worked
things out.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.170
- Well, that is very touching.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.738
I'm glad that we have
everyone's support.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.873
- Yeah, I think it's that, uh,

02:19.907 --> 02:21.609
and I think it's the fact that

02:21.642 --> 02:24.445
you've been a smidge needy
this past week?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.547
- Hmm.
- Maybe needy's the wrong word.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.216
- Hmm.
- Clingy?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.850
- I see. Well I'm glad
everyone's gonna be able

02:29.883 --> 02:31.519
to sleep soundly tonight,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.787
because I am going to do this.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.891
- Good luck.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.927
- (Sighs) Thank you.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.695
And I have missed him a lot.

02:41.729 --> 02:46.700
And I am very excited to not,
not be with him anymore.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.402
- I know.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.438
You sure you don't wanna wait
another day, though?

02:50.471 --> 02:53.674
I mean you never know what
could show up on your doorstep.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.976
- I don't like what
you're insinuating.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.447
That said, if a package does
arrive, please keep it safe.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.355
- Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.557
- Oh, always. Just not now.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.825
Council is about to decide
which bid

03:11.859 --> 03:14.228
will be awarded the first-ever

03:14.262 --> 03:16.664
district-wide
Arts and Culture Grant.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.900
- I know. Which is why I wanted
to give you this.

03:19.933 --> 03:24.505
- And what, pray tell, might
this collection of words be?

03:24.538 --> 03:29.377
- As of today, feel free to
refer to me as Alexis Rose,

03:29.410 --> 03:32.280
Founder and CEO of Alexis Rose
Communications.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.682
- Alexis, that's wonderful!

03:34.715 --> 03:36.984
- This is my first business
proposal.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.554
I'm throwing my hat in the ring
for the Arts and Culture Grant.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.756
- Wow!
Now, don't get me wrong,

03:43.957 --> 03:46.260
there is no High-Street beret

03:46.294 --> 03:48.462
that I would rather
have thrown in my ring,

03:48.496 --> 03:50.931
but I have a funny feeling

03:50.964 --> 03:53.334
Council already
has its favourite.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.369
- Okay, well I wish I knew it
was rigged

03:55.403 --> 03:57.671
before I worked so hard on it.

03:58.839 --> 04:02.376
- Oh, very well, Alexis, let's
hear your elevator pitch.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.645
But bear in mind, I have
to get off on the next floor.

04:04.678 --> 04:08.816
- Okay, um, it's a singles
night at the café.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.853
And the goal is, um,

04:12.886 --> 04:15.556
to get people from nearby
communities together,

04:15.589 --> 04:18.292
for like romance and nibblies.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.861
And hire some staff,
and dating experts,

04:20.894 --> 04:22.496
and make a whole night of it.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.033
- Darling, I realize the
pickings are slim

04:26.066 --> 04:27.635
in this rural spanandry,

04:27.668 --> 04:31.339
but you can't ask Council
to misuse public funds

04:31.372 --> 04:34.575
just so that you can find
yourself a new boy toy.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.077
- Excuse me, this has nothing
to do with the fact

04:37.110 --> 04:38.646
that I'm single.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.349
The singles market
is very lucrative.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.751
Did you know, that there's
a small town in Ireland

04:43.784 --> 04:45.586
that hosts a singles week
every year,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.488
and it's become so popular,

04:47.521 --> 04:49.823
that they're able to subsidize
their entirely yearly budget,

04:49.857 --> 04:51.725
just on profits?

04:51.759 --> 04:54.662
- It's a valiant first effort,
Alexis, it is.

04:54.695 --> 04:58.632
But darling, do keep those
wheels turning!

05:00.100 --> 05:02.035
As the Irish like to say,

05:02.069 --> 05:05.406
it's a cinch to mash
the Murphy where there's love.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.675
(Door opens and closes)

05:07.708 --> 05:09.710
- Ugh!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.514
- Morning.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.518
- Uh oh, looks like something
showed up for you this morning.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.520
- O-kay? Who's it from?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.792
- Well, there might be a hint
in the card.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.495
(Paper rustles)

05:33.066 --> 05:36.370
- Congratulations,
Employee of the Month?

05:36.404 --> 05:38.772
Since when has this been
a thing?

05:38.806 --> 05:41.442
- Well, this is the second
month.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.412
I won it last month,
took myself out for lunch.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.782
I'm kidding. It's a little
incentive for a job well done.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.787
- Oh, I mean, wouldn't wanna be
ungrateful.

05:53.821 --> 05:54.988
(Paper rustles)

05:57.190 --> 05:59.660
Uh...this seems like...

06:00.928 --> 06:02.663
some makeup?

06:04.432 --> 06:07.000
It's like a briefcase
full of makeup.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.802
- Yeah, only the best.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.872
- And you thought of this
for me because?

06:11.905 --> 06:13.807
- Because you deserve it.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.509
- I see.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.145
Well, I'm gonna save
this for a special occasion.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.648
- No, no, no,
it's for everyday use.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.083
It's what the woman
in the store told me.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.786
- Thanks.

06:25.819 --> 06:26.987
- Stevie?

06:28.121 --> 06:31.124
Aren't you forgetting something?

06:31.158 --> 06:32.993
- Uh, I just...

06:34.227 --> 06:36.664
just don't know
how to thank you.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.500
- Oh, that smile on your face
is all I need.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.904
(Jazz music plays)

06:45.606 --> 06:47.808
(Door opens, bell jingles)

06:49.209 --> 06:50.978
- Hi.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.012
- Hi.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.015
- (Sighs)

06:57.150 --> 06:59.587
So, after some time alone,

07:01.555 --> 07:03.657
I just wanted to come here,

07:03.691 --> 07:05.693
and tell you, that I--

07:05.726 --> 07:08.462
- David, I need to apologize
to you.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.163
I was going to sleep last night
and I realized

07:10.197 --> 07:12.132
I have not been respectful
of your space.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.901
All of the texts, and the gifts.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.470
Uh, I was upset,
and it was reactionary,

07:16.504 --> 07:18.506
and I thought I was doing
the right thing,

07:18.539 --> 07:20.541
but really all I was doing
was smothering you,

07:20.574 --> 07:22.175
when you had asked for space,
and that's not right.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.545
- Okay, well smothering's
a bit intense.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.146
- It was self-serving,
and it was desperate,

07:26.179 --> 07:28.482
and, and I'm...
I'm embarrassed.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.751
- Okay, there's no need
to feel embarrassed.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.654
- Well, I am. I've just been
trying to deal with everything

07:33.687 --> 07:35.923
here at the store,
and I think you're right.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.192
It's probably better if we
just focus on the business,

07:39.226 --> 07:41.161
and, and not try to push
anything.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.664
- I'm not sure I said that.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.733
- You didn't have to.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.234
In fact, by saying nothing
at all,

07:47.267 --> 07:49.603
you... you spoke volumes.

07:51.705 --> 07:55.743
- Okay, s-so you would like
to focus on the store, then?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.747
- I think that's probably
a good idea.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.017
But hey, it's good to have
you back.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.853
- Oh. Hmm.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.054
Okay. Mm hmm.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.059
- So uh...

08:15.896 --> 08:17.865
Roland: Well, I'm gonna go
ahead and file

08:17.898 --> 08:22.135
Ray's Ham and Clam Bake
in the t'won't happen pile.

08:22.169 --> 08:26.106
- Hmm. After a glud of unasinous
ideas put forth today,

08:26.139 --> 08:29.242
the room is suddenly
bombilating with anticipation.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.878
Can we feel that?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.846
It's almost as though
we're building towards

08:32.880 --> 08:35.549
some sort of inevitable climax.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.019
- All right, well,
we have one here

08:39.052 --> 08:42.723
called Untitled
Moira Rose Project.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.860
- I'd like us all to close
our eyes,

08:46.894 --> 08:49.697
and picture 3 to 5... hundred
acres

08:50.798 --> 08:53.033
of carefully-manicured lawn.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.769
Accessorized with sculptures
from some of the world's

08:55.803 --> 08:58.706
most-significant cultural
contributors.

08:58.739 --> 09:02.610
On your left, a whimsical
gestalt by David von Schlegell.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.179
On your right, a playful
abstract by Isamu Noguchi.

09:06.213 --> 09:10.050
Dead ahead, your senses
have just been affronted

09:10.083 --> 09:12.720
by a Magdalena Abakanowicz.

09:12.753 --> 09:17.057
Now, imagine an even more
splendacious art park,

09:17.090 --> 09:19.026
in your very own backyard!

09:20.260 --> 09:23.997
Council, I humbly present
Rosewood.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.268
- Uh...

09:28.301 --> 09:30.103
yeah, I gotta say,

09:30.137 --> 09:32.640
you're not gonna find a bigger
Noguchi-head than me,

09:32.673 --> 09:36.209
but I think I speak for
everyone here when I say,

09:36.243 --> 09:39.379
good luck on getting your mitts
on a von Schlegell!

09:39.412 --> 09:42.049
(Laughs)

09:42.082 --> 09:43.984
(Coughs)
Am I right, guys?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.853
- I think we need to be more
realistic

09:45.886 --> 09:47.755
about what we can pull off.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.023
- And who's to say
what we can pull off?

09:50.057 --> 09:52.159
I recently heard of a small
town in Scotland,

09:52.192 --> 09:54.227
no bigger than a thimble,

09:54.261 --> 09:57.765
that is making millions
from a week-long singles fest.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.768
Now, if an idea as simple
as that can work

10:00.801 --> 10:03.904
for a people as infamously
disorganized as the Scotch,

10:03.937 --> 10:07.074
surely we can aspire to
something of equal scale.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.976
- Now there's an idea.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.645
- Thank you! Ronnie's on board
with Rosewood.

10:11.679 --> 10:15.082
- No, I'm not!
I like the singles fest.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.050
- No, no, that was merely
an example

10:17.084 --> 10:20.053
of how Rosewood would similarly
put us on the map.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.323
- Moira, let's stuff Rosewood
in a drawer for right now.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.026
I like this singles idea.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.127
- No.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.697
- Single people is what
this town needs!

10:29.730 --> 10:31.765
Loose wallets,
loose inhibitions,

10:31.799 --> 10:33.734
everything's just really loose.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.903
- I vote for singles week.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.705
- All in favour of singles
week?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.439
- Aye!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.074
- Okay. (Bangs gavel)

10:45.813 --> 10:47.314
(Dot matrix printer whirs)
(Door opens)

10:47.347 --> 10:50.117
(Slams)

10:50.150 --> 10:52.319
- By all means, feel free
to use the printer

10:52.352 --> 10:55.055
whenever you like.
- Thank you.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.324
Just um, receipt for business
cards that I ordered.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.926
- Hmm.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.761
- And a few pages of temporary
letterhead.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.731
And um, a list of Buzzfeed's
most motivational quotes

11:03.764 --> 11:05.933
for girl bosses under 30.

11:07.935 --> 11:10.437
- I'm gonna do something
uncharacteristic,

11:10.470 --> 11:12.773
and ask your advice.

11:12.806 --> 11:16.910
Is there something off
about the way that I look?

11:16.944 --> 11:19.412
- Did someone mention
the posture thing?

11:19.446 --> 11:22.182
- What?
- What is the utility shirts?

11:22.215 --> 11:23.851
- No.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.753
- No, okay, um, well you should
probably just go ahead

11:25.786 --> 11:27.187
and tell me what you meant then.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.789
- Yeah.

11:28.822 --> 11:33.026
Um, so your Dad got me
a suitcase of makeup.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.163
No, no.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.133
- Hmm.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.073
- And he suggested that
I wear it every day.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.475
So, I'm having a really
hard time

11:48.508 --> 11:50.944
not taking that personally.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.213
- Here's the thing you should
know about my Dad,

11:53.246 --> 11:56.349
sweetest little guy,
gives the worst gifts.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.518
- Okay, well that makes me
feel a little better.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.954
Like he built David
a basketball court

12:00.988 --> 12:02.756
for his Bar Mitzvah.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.992
- Oh boy, okay.
- Mm hmm.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.227
And unfortunately, the only way
to like, train it out of him,

12:07.260 --> 12:10.130
is to show him just
how wrong the gift is.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.033
Like, David forced us
to watch him shoot at a basket

12:13.066 --> 12:15.135
for 10 minutes,
until the ball hit the rim,

12:15.168 --> 12:16.536
and then bounced back
in his face.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.205
But it actually worked out
perfectly,

12:18.238 --> 12:20.240
because all David really wanted
for his Bar Mitzvah,

12:20.273 --> 12:21.441
was a nose job.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.310
They took the court down
the next day.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.045
- Huh.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.315
- Oh, and also, he gave me
a diamond tennis bracelet

12:28.348 --> 12:29.749
for my Sweet 16.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.020
- That's bad.
- I know.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.194
(Jazz music plays)

12:43.230 --> 12:45.198
- (Sighs)

12:48.535 --> 12:50.503
You know what, I'm probably
good to finish this up,

12:50.537 --> 12:52.439
- Okay.
-...if you wanna go for lunch.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.509
What?
- I don't know, you tell me.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.012
- I just did. I'm happy to
finish doing the creams,

12:59.046 --> 13:00.580
I...I don't think
it's a two-person job.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.149
- Okay, so you're just gonna
stay here

13:02.182 --> 13:04.117
and not have lunch then,
or are we going in shifts?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.819
- I don't know, David,

13:05.853 --> 13:07.454
I'm just trying to be
professional here, okay?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.322
Think this is gonna take
a minute to get used to.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.058
- I don't want to get used
to this!

13:11.091 --> 13:13.560
I don't wanna pretend
like we're co-workers.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.063
- We are co-workers.

13:16.096 --> 13:21.234
- Okay, I just liked it better
when we were more than that.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.071
- David, I'm just trying to go
off of what you wanted.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.506
- You wouldn't let me finish
telling you what I wanted!

13:26.539 --> 13:29.176
I was ready to get back
together days ago!

13:29.209 --> 13:31.111
- What?
- Yes.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.882
- Then why didn't we?

13:36.649 --> 13:39.586
- I've never been in this
situation before.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.589
Where someone's been
so nice... to me.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.859
And generous.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.396
- I'm sorry, were you holding
back on talking to me

13:49.429 --> 13:51.598
because you were getting gifts?

13:52.632 --> 13:55.335
- I was very upset,
and confused.

13:56.636 --> 14:00.173
So upset, that I barely
finished the chocolates.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.909
- David, this wasn't meant
to be some

14:01.942 --> 14:04.044
Advent calendar of apologies,

14:04.077 --> 14:06.513
it was like an olive branch
to get you to talk to me.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.916
I just, I guess, didn't know,

14:08.949 --> 14:11.952
how many olive branches you
were planning on extending.

14:11.985 --> 14:15.322
- Ideally, one!
- Okay, well now I know.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.657
- Yeah, and now I know, that
while I was torturing myself,

14:17.690 --> 14:20.027
you were sitting at home,
just opening gifts.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.162
I see you like the bracelet.
- Love the bracelet, thank you.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.966
Um, does this mean that we...
are back...?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.537
- You know what,
I feel like now

14:30.570 --> 14:33.306
maybe I deserve an olive branch,
or two?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.175
- Okay, I understand that.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.279
What if...I gave you back some
of the olive branches

14:39.312 --> 14:41.248
that you gave to me?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.450
I was lying about the
chocolates, I ate them all.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.654
But I'm sure there are some
flowers that are still alive.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.957
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Mmhmm?

14:49.990 --> 14:52.559
- I'm gonna go to lunch,
and you're gonna sit here,

14:52.592 --> 14:54.561
and think about
what you've done. Okay?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.596
- Okay.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.967
(Receding footsteps thud)

15:00.000 --> 15:02.669
- Um, while you're at lunch,
can you get me some lunch?

15:04.137 --> 15:06.073
- Unbelievable.

I can do go a quick shift

over at Bazonga's
Gentleman's Lounge.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.728

the hint.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.097
- Hint? What hint?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.566
- Look, Stevie, I'm not
necessarily known

16:06.599 --> 16:08.535
for my gift-giving skills,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.403
but Arlene down
at the store said

16:10.437 --> 16:14.474
this is what all the young
locals are buying, and I...

16:14.507 --> 16:16.543
- No, I really appreciate
the gift,

16:16.576 --> 16:18.411
but let's just agree
that going forward,

16:18.445 --> 16:21.681
we don't need gifts to express
our mutual appreciation.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.316
- Understood.

16:25.385 --> 16:29.222
Well, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna step outside.

What a delightful
little home office

16:44.571 --> 16:46.606
you've created for yourself.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.075
- Thank you.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.043
- Succulents, and all!

16:51.278 --> 16:52.745
You might be interested
to know

16:52.779 --> 16:54.614
that Council has made
a decision.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.716
- So they chose your idea, then?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.251
- I wouldn't let them have it.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.287
Not until they accepted
my demand,

17:00.320 --> 17:04.057
which was to employ the
services of the CEO

17:04.091 --> 17:07.094
and Founder of Alexis Rose -
whatever you called it -

17:07.127 --> 17:09.296
as part of my advisory team.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.364
- What?
- Hmm.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.433
- Really?

17:13.466 --> 17:15.635
Okay, I'm shocked. Thank you!

17:15.668 --> 17:17.637
- No, Alexis, thank you!

17:17.670 --> 17:20.073
- Okay, so what's the project?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.511
- Hmm, well we landed
on a one-of-a-kind

17:24.544 --> 17:27.180
event to celebrate
and congregate

17:29.149 --> 17:32.585
those who happen to be
unattached, uh,

17:32.619 --> 17:36.123
in the hopes of facilitating
interpersonal connections.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.760
- Sorry, so like,
a singles event, then?

17:40.793 --> 17:43.163
- That word is now
considered derogatory.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.732
I believe they prefer
to be called independents.

17:45.765 --> 17:49.836
- So you stole my idea,
took it to Council,

17:49.869 --> 17:52.372
and claimed it as your own?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.441
- Alexis, now is not the time
for pettifogging!

17:54.474 --> 17:55.675
- Ugh!

17:55.708 --> 17:57.110
- Singles Week just happened
to be the idea

17:57.144 --> 17:59.312
that received a lot of traction.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.713
- Singles Week?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.882
I was pitching a Singles Night.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.352
- No. No, no, no,

18:05.385 --> 18:07.787
you specifically referenced
a small shire in Scotland--

18:07.820 --> 18:09.322
- Ireland!

18:09.356 --> 18:12.359
- ...that had a very lucrative
week-long singles event.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.695
- No, that is where I got
the idea for singles night.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.267
- I was proposing like, a
matchmaking event at the café.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.770
- Well then, I took your little
germ of an idea,

18:23.803 --> 18:26.539
and I fertilized it
to fruition.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.377
- Okay, okay, I literally
started my company today.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.712
Do you know how much work
this is gonna be?

18:34.214 --> 18:36.383
Okay, we will be Co-Chairs,

18:36.416 --> 18:39.519
and I will be charging Council
my full fee.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.754
- Starting to get keyed up
about this prospect

18:41.788 --> 18:43.656

18:43.690 --> 18:46.193
Modern day Judy and Lorna.

well I'm gonna go to dinner,

18:59.472 --> 19:01.941
and if you wanted to join me,
and pay for it,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.310
that could be a start.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.312
- Yeah, maybe I could do that.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.915
Uh, I just think I have
something to do first, so...

19:10.917 --> 19:12.652
- What is this?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.521
- Consider this my olive branch.
