00:23.464 --> 00:24.526
i think you missed a spot.

00:24.552 --> 00:25.263
where ?

00:29.756 --> 00:31.846
well, i know what you did this summer.

00:32.856 --> 00:33.654
lois ?

00:33.689 --> 00:34.429
oh,

00:35.110 --> 00:36.906
don't look so guilty, smallville.

00:36.942 --> 00:38.926
it's about time you
lovebirds flapped your wings.

00:38.961 --> 00:40.509
what are you doing back ?

00:40.544 --> 00:42.904
we thought you were in europe
until the end of the year.

00:42.927 --> 00:43.714
hoping.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.945
well, are you gonna stay with chloe ?

00:45.980 --> 00:48.655
actually, i just ran into
mrs. kent at the talon,

00:48.678 --> 00:52.119
and right out of nowhere, she asked if
i'd like to move back in at the farm.

00:54.032 --> 00:54.995
yeah, right.

00:56.638 --> 00:57.495
really ?

00:57.777 --> 00:59.761
i know. isn't that sweet ?

01:01.698 --> 01:05.503
oh, don't worry. you little snuggle
bunnies can hop around all you want.

01:05.538 --> 01:06.722
i'm a heavy sleeper.

01:08.941 --> 01:10.244
i'm going for a dip.

01:10.491 --> 01:11.853
think she could sleep

01:11.945 --> 01:13.882
through me smothering
her with a pillow ?

01:15.162 --> 01:18.015
don't stay in the sun too
long. you're gonna get fried.

01:22.885 --> 01:27.276
so, i take it lana hasn't gotten a peek into
the confidential files of clark kent yet.

01:30.270 --> 01:33.928
chloe, you think i'm happy about having
my powers back and lying about them ?

01:34.644 --> 01:36.124
i didn't ask for this life.

01:37.357 --> 01:40.832
we didn't ask for a world that needs
heroes. but the truth is, we do...

01:41.325 --> 01:43.096
now more than ever, clark.

02:14.598 --> 02:15.819
something's wrong.

02:16.406 --> 02:18.226
She's been underwater too long.

02:19.470 --> 02:20.175
go !

02:55.309 --> 02:56.389
is she all right ?

02:57.904 --> 02:59.231
i'm working on it.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.222
Oh, hey ! Hey ! Hey !

03:28.861 --> 03:29.566
Hey.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.222
maybe you ought to stick to the shallow
end till you learn how to swim, gorgeous.

03:47.503 --> 03:50.087
maybe you ought to try
breath mints, surfer boy.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.933
name's arthur curry.
my friends call me a. c.

03:56.378 --> 03:58.303
come on. we got to get
you back to the farm.

03:59.498 --> 04:00.264
Wow...

04:01.541 --> 04:03.549
where did bobby baywatch come from ?

04:03.584 --> 04:04.462
i don't know...

04:05.249 --> 04:06.952
be he can sure swim fast.

04:07.445 --> 04:10.685
are we talking olympic-gold-medal
fast or meteor-freak fast ?

04:10.721 --> 04:12.083
no, this is something else.

04:12.221 --> 04:14.100
he can swim faster than i can.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.053
"Aqua"

05:14.839 --> 05:17.939
do you know where the greatest
supercomputer in the world resides ?

05:18.890 --> 05:19.771
right here.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.206
it's the human brain.

05:23.098 --> 05:25.200
yet we only use 10% of it.

05:28.136 --> 05:30.566
good morning, mr. kent.

05:31.606 --> 05:33.578
did we start too early for you ?

05:34.024 --> 05:36.173
sorry, i kind of got lost.

05:37.582 --> 05:40.189
if there are any other
wayward travelers, this is

05:40.224 --> 05:44.269
"introduction to world history,"
and i am professor milton fine.

05:44.328 --> 05:45.126
but

05:45.455 --> 05:48.954
before we delve into my lectures about
the greeks, romans, and spartans...

05:48.989 --> 05:51.575
all of which i'm sure you'll
find very enlightening...

05:51.845 --> 05:53.513
let's look at the word "history."

05:54.828 --> 05:55.814
history

05:56.495 --> 05:59.099
is not about facts.

05:59.851 --> 06:01.682
it's about the context

06:01.800 --> 06:04.900
and who is telling the story.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.020
so,

06:07.384 --> 06:08.887
what is history ?

06:09.098 --> 06:10.742
what is her story ?

06:10.918 --> 06:13.196
what is your story, mr. kent ?

06:13.948 --> 06:16.049
how will you affect the world around you

06:16.073 --> 06:17.822
for the generations to come ?

06:20.251 --> 06:22.846
i'm not sure you can know that at 18.

06:23.703 --> 06:25.993
tell that to alexander the great.

06:28.952 --> 06:30.831
or to bring it closer to home...

06:30.915 --> 06:32.464
lex luthor.

06:33.721 --> 06:35.553
now, he's not much older than you are,

06:35.799 --> 06:40.918
and yet he's turned his father's agribusiness
into a leading defense contractor.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.570
he's gone from feeding
people to killing them.

06:44.828 --> 06:48.482
and yet his story is
that he is a white knight

06:48.517 --> 06:51.406
who's just put a small
kansas town on the map.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.525
beware of white knights, people.

06:57.327 --> 07:00.087
they don't, uh, slay dragons.

07:00.568 --> 07:01.907
they train them

07:02.142 --> 07:04.361
to suit their own dark purpose.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.688
think of hitler,

07:06.095 --> 07:07.022
stalin,

07:08.150 --> 07:09.383
napoleon.

07:09.993 --> 07:11.578
lex is not a saint...

07:12.635 --> 07:15.357
but i don't think you can put him
in the same league as those guys.

07:17.940 --> 07:19.349
an honest opinion...

07:21.063 --> 07:22.026
i like that.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.407
i think it's full.

07:39.808 --> 07:42.391
customers like it that way.
more bang for their buck.

07:42.908 --> 07:43.986
i got a buck.

07:44.655 --> 07:45.841
- yeah ?
- yeah.

07:45.876 --> 07:47.884
you should use it to
get some fashion sense.

07:49.293 --> 07:50.326
- Hey
- Here you go.

07:50.362 --> 07:51.452
Thanks.

08:08.370 --> 08:11.588
you know this, uh, whole
orange-and-green thing you got going ?

08:12.489 --> 08:14.356
it looks like flipper threw up.

08:17.221 --> 08:18.395
i'll tell you what.

08:19.464 --> 08:21.742
you show me how to
dress the way you like,

08:22.303 --> 08:24.147
and i'll teach you how to swim.

08:26.730 --> 08:28.573
i know how to swim. thank you.

08:29.196 --> 08:30.382
you're welcome.

08:31.650 --> 08:32.410
but...

08:33.385 --> 08:36.813
next time, i might not be there to suck
the water out of those pretty lungs.

08:39.456 --> 08:40.054
look,

08:40.336 --> 08:43.914
i didn't need you to play the
paramedic, fish stick, all right ?

08:44.537 --> 08:46.580
i just had a little bit of water

08:46.604 --> 08:47.842
down the wrong pipe.

08:49.075 --> 08:50.613
you were turning blue.

08:50.695 --> 08:52.081
it's a good color on me.

08:54.523 --> 08:56.895
look, it was a freak
accident, all right ?

08:56.930 --> 08:58.601
i practically live in the water.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.529
me too.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.736
but i can swim.

09:02.899 --> 09:03.967
so can i.

09:04.637 --> 09:07.288
i'm a great swimmer.
i can swim like a fish.

09:09.226 --> 09:10.036
prove it.

09:17.978 --> 09:18.847
professor ?

09:19.293 --> 09:22.598
i'm sorry to bother you, but i got off
on the wrong foot. i wanted to apologize.

09:22.638 --> 09:24.126
never apologize.

09:24.150 --> 09:27.062
if you're gonna show up late, at
least do it with conviction, mr. kent.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.081
how do you know my name ?

09:29.572 --> 09:31.803
what was the first thing you
did the day of orientation ?

09:32.096 --> 09:33.541
i got my picture taken.

09:33.564 --> 09:37.274
yeah, and that photo is in a database
which i check before the semester begins.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.740
that way, i can call my
students by their proper names.

09:40.033 --> 09:41.970
helps the learning process.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.859
how long have you been
friends with lex luthor ?

09:44.882 --> 09:46.420
who said we were friends ?

09:46.456 --> 09:47.794
it's just a deduction.

09:47.841 --> 09:50.903
why else would the son of family
farmers be defending such a man ?

09:50.950 --> 09:52.148
it's a long story.

09:52.453 --> 09:54.285
but he's not the man
you make him out to be.

09:57.622 --> 10:01.379
well, you know, groucho marx said there's
only one way to find out if a man's honest...

10:01.497 --> 10:02.436
ask him.

10:02.695 --> 10:04.996
if he says, "yes," he must be crooked.

10:05.923 --> 10:09.430
i would think a college professor
would be quoting karl marx, not groucho.

10:09.467 --> 10:12.496
german philosophy's
easy. comedy's hard. hey,

10:13.222 --> 10:14.690
why don't you come work for me ?

10:14.866 --> 10:17.872
i've been interviewing research
assistants for my new book on luthorcorp.

10:17.895 --> 10:20.056
you could find out the truth
about lex luthor yourself.

10:20.173 --> 10:23.273
thanks, professor, but i'm not
really looking for a job right now.

10:25.386 --> 10:28.427
you know what's worse than the fear
of speaking the truth, mr. kent ?

10:28.791 --> 10:30.728
it's the fear of uncovering it.

10:36.422 --> 10:37.491
you coming or what ?

10:37.782 --> 10:39.308
i'm waiting on you.

10:39.343 --> 10:42.749
i thought you loved the water.
you're tiring out already on me.

10:43.323 --> 10:44.615
i'm just enjoying the view.

10:44.639 --> 10:46.024
oh, yeah, yeah.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.300
so, you ready to race or what ?

10:49.321 --> 10:51.258
you don't really think you're
faster than me, do you ?

10:51.282 --> 10:52.761
oh, i know i am.

10:52.796 --> 10:53.442
Uh...

10:53.466 --> 10:54.170
ready ?

10:54.300 --> 10:54.910
all right.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.505
on three. one, two...

11:10.082 --> 11:10.740
hey.

11:11.925 --> 11:12.642
hey !

11:13.663 --> 11:15.236
how did you do that ?

11:15.483 --> 11:16.457
don't sweat it.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.277
i'm part fish.

11:21.985 --> 11:22.678
Thank you.

11:25.038 --> 11:25.731
ohh.

11:26.365 --> 11:26.987
ohh.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.654
no, that was pretty good.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.425
you can seriously strut out there.

11:30.918 --> 11:32.174
well, lots of practice.

11:32.597 --> 11:34.452
my swim teacher was a navy seal.

11:37.223 --> 11:38.504
i swim with the seals.

11:39.714 --> 11:40.677
they're awesome.

11:42.825 --> 11:45.174
you're not a military brat, are you ?

11:46.113 --> 11:46.853
nope.

11:48.106 --> 11:49.245
just a brat.

12:01.490 --> 12:02.524
what are you doing ?

12:11.741 --> 12:13.232
what's happening ?

12:13.549 --> 12:14.512
what's going on ?!

12:14.535 --> 12:15.639
you don't hear that ?

12:15.674 --> 12:16.802
hear what ?

12:19.914 --> 12:20.842
a. c. ?

12:27.346 --> 12:28.157
a. c. ?

12:34.616 --> 12:35.532
a. c. ?

12:36.918 --> 12:37.763
a. c. ?

12:52.103 --> 12:53.510
okay, okay.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.058
just lay back, lay back.

13:17.534 --> 13:20.388
with the exception of an
unexplained disturbance at the site,

13:20.423 --> 13:22.560
today's trial was a complete success.

13:23.076 --> 13:25.272
great. send me the tapes.

13:27.555 --> 13:29.398
the best part of my job...

13:29.656 --> 13:32.345
watching impossible
dreams become reality.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.541
how far was the target ?

13:34.761 --> 13:36.396
three kilometers away.

13:36.429 --> 13:37.427
three kilometers ?

13:38.601 --> 13:41.125
that's half a kilometer
further than projected.

13:41.208 --> 13:41.818
yes.

13:42.358 --> 13:45.742
leviathan is exceeding all
expectations across the board.

13:46.611 --> 13:48.091
if this goes well tomorrow,

13:48.302 --> 13:52.576
my associates from the pentagon are gonna want
to put leviathan on every vessel in the fleet.

13:53.837 --> 13:55.328
what about marine life ?

13:56.514 --> 13:58.835
we still haven't figured
out how to protect them...

13:58.870 --> 14:01.266
there are plenty of
fish in the sea, doctor.

14:01.817 --> 14:04.542
nobody's gonna miss a
couple that go belly-up.

14:05.187 --> 14:07.383
let's get leviathan back to the lab.

14:15.827 --> 14:16.638
hey.

14:17.154 --> 14:17.817
thanks.

14:18.557 --> 14:21.211
we really should get you
checked out at a hospital.

14:24.710 --> 14:25.614
no, i'm cool.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.115
is that surfer talk for, "there
was blood coming out of my ears" ?

14:30.154 --> 14:32.807
'cause, you know, on dry land,
that usually isn't a good sign.

14:33.826 --> 14:36.470
it's probably just an ear
infection or something.

14:37.196 --> 14:38.594
can we just drop it ?

14:40.566 --> 14:41.259
uh...

14:42.480 --> 14:43.126
sure.

14:46.162 --> 14:47.371
what are you doing ?

14:48.041 --> 14:49.543
seeing if you have a fever.

14:50.060 --> 14:51.692
you really don't listen, do you ?

14:51.727 --> 14:54.005
no, i try not to. i find it distracting.

14:55.474 --> 14:56.225
well...

14:56.859 --> 14:58.162
what's the verdict, doc ?

14:59.595 --> 15:01.568
you're actually a little cold.

15:01.615 --> 15:02.777
that's weird.

15:03.622 --> 15:05.255
i'm feeling kind of warm right now.

15:06.558 --> 15:08.636
does that line ever work on anyone ?

15:09.094 --> 15:11.266
i figured it was,
like, a one in 10 shot.

15:11.983 --> 15:13.415
but you're worth the risk.

15:14.460 --> 15:15.857
you don't even know me.

15:16.406 --> 15:17.521
what's to know ?

15:18.155 --> 15:21.220
you're abrasive, sarcastic.
you never shut up.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.852
yeah, and those are my good qualities.

15:22.876 --> 15:23.962
oh, i know.

15:30.094 --> 15:33.018
look, just because you saved
me when i wasn't really drowning

15:33.041 --> 15:35.073
does not give you the right
to slobber all over me.

15:35.272 --> 15:36.106
i'm sorry.

15:37.503 --> 15:38.431
you should be.

15:56.193 --> 15:56.980
lois.

16:01.136 --> 16:02.154
hey, smallville.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.279
lois is all over this guy,

16:10.303 --> 16:12.837
and all we know about him is that
he can swim faster than i can.

16:13.577 --> 16:15.244
chloe: well, let me look him up.

16:15.279 --> 16:17.744
he's a sophomore at university of miami,

16:17.782 --> 16:20.064
majoring in marine biology.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.966
oh, and here's a shocker...

16:22.001 --> 16:25.937
he's on the swim team, leaving
all of his competition in the wake.

16:26.008 --> 16:27.405
does he have a criminal record ?

16:27.440 --> 16:28.415
uh...

16:30.904 --> 16:31.644
yeah.

16:32.595 --> 16:35.319
last year, he broke into
the ocean village resort.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.554
what'd he steal ?

16:38.973 --> 16:40.405
eight dolphins.

16:40.828 --> 16:44.409
he busted open an underwater fence
and released them back into the ocean.

16:44.562 --> 16:48.164
i don't know, clark... it doesn't really
sound like fbi's most-wanted material to me.

16:48.187 --> 16:50.265
maybe it's the only thing
he's been caught for.

16:50.665 --> 16:51.496
maybe,

16:51.532 --> 16:55.620
but, i mean, according to all of this, he has
never dipped a fin in smallville until now.

16:55.653 --> 16:58.084
it sort of shoots down
our meteor-freak theory.

16:58.107 --> 17:00.972
he's not the first guy i met who didn't
get his abilities from meteor rocks.

17:01.078 --> 17:01.864
really ?

17:02.964 --> 17:04.713
there was this kid last year.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.896
he kind of ran too
fast for his own good.

17:08.506 --> 17:11.040
well, so far the only thing
we have on arthur curry

17:11.076 --> 17:14.539
is that he saved lois from
being permanently waterlogged.

17:15.243 --> 17:19.093
clark, are you sure you're not just upset
that someone was stealing your hero thunder ?

17:21.089 --> 17:22.980
i don't know what it
is about this guy...

17:24.670 --> 17:26.021
...but i get a bad feeling.

17:29.737 --> 17:31.780
you guys, you should have
seen this guy. it was amazing.

17:31.815 --> 17:33.893
i've never seen anybody swim so fast.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.924
or drink so much water.

17:36.298 --> 17:37.812
it keeps my skin soft.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.957
so, how do you like the
university of miami ?

17:42.403 --> 17:43.789
you go to school in miami ?

17:44.247 --> 17:46.055
yeah. how'd you know that ?

17:46.324 --> 17:48.215
i'm a big fan of college swimming.

17:48.508 --> 17:50.117
really ? since when ?

17:50.140 --> 17:52.700
since arthur curry started
dominating the sport.

17:53.381 --> 17:55.390
so how'd you learn to swim so fast ?

17:56.693 --> 17:57.903
i don't know.

17:57.950 --> 17:59.640
i guess it runs in the family.

17:59.910 --> 18:03.081
my dad operates a lighthouse down
south. he swims like a lead weight.

18:04.178 --> 18:06.808
so it must have been my
mom with the skills, but...

18:07.266 --> 18:08.910
she died when i was a baby.

18:08.945 --> 18:10.366
a. c., i'm so sorry.

18:11.998 --> 18:13.888
i'm not gonna say it
doesn't suck, but...

18:14.839 --> 18:17.154
you know, growing up by
the water was awesome.

18:18.082 --> 18:20.183
i probably spent more
time in it than out.

18:21.604 --> 18:24.317
and what brings you to the most
landlocked spot on the map ?

18:24.598 --> 18:25.848
crater lake.

18:26.893 --> 18:29.335
the last few months a bunch
of fish have been dying off.

18:29.453 --> 18:31.907
and the e. p. a. blames
it on temperature change,

18:32.036 --> 18:33.868
but i think that's totally bogus.

18:33.903 --> 18:36.965
smallville's a long way to go
to check on temperature changes.

18:37.564 --> 18:39.678
not if you care about
the world you live in.

18:39.889 --> 18:43.952
see, people think that what happens in
oceans and lakes doesn't affect their lives.

18:44.413 --> 18:45.341
but it does.

18:45.951 --> 18:47.161
it's all connected.

18:49.380 --> 18:51.740
do you really believe that,
or is that a pickup line ?

18:51.775 --> 18:52.527
clark !

18:53.548 --> 18:54.358
smallville,

18:54.949 --> 18:56.874
can i talk to you over
here for a minute ?

18:59.129 --> 19:01.618
there's a cinnamon bun
i need your opinion on.

19:02.276 --> 19:03.356
what are you doing ?

19:03.391 --> 19:06.526
i already have an overprotective dad.
i don't need an overprotective brother,

19:06.561 --> 19:08.687
especially one who isn't my brother.

19:08.728 --> 19:11.346
am i the only one who thinks there's
something fishy about this guy ?

19:11.487 --> 19:13.436
yes ! now quit being a jerk !

19:15.329 --> 19:16.738
i'm sorry about that.

19:17.302 --> 19:18.276
no, it's cool.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.448
i got to bounce.

19:23.114 --> 19:24.553
do you want some company ?

19:26.326 --> 19:29.238
no, i-i have a few things
i need to take care of,

19:29.274 --> 19:30.295
so i'll just swing by later.

19:38.308 --> 19:39.612
you know, you're right. i...

19:39.647 --> 19:41.737
i was being a jerk.
i'm gonna go apologize.

19:44.097 --> 19:46.143
i don't know how you
put up with him, lana.

22:28.495 --> 22:30.679
thanks for dropping the
a-bomb on my date, smallville.

22:30.715 --> 22:32.370
did you apologize to a. c. ?

22:32.405 --> 22:33.709
i didn't get a chance to.

22:33.767 --> 22:34.613
why not ?

22:34.636 --> 22:36.856
he was too busy playing terrorist.

22:36.891 --> 22:37.713
what ?!

22:37.901 --> 22:38.711
lois,

22:39.122 --> 22:41.517
i saw him trying to
blow up some sort of lab.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.478
you really don't like him, do you ?

22:43.631 --> 22:45.380
it has nothing to do
with the way i feel.

22:45.404 --> 22:45.989
no ?

22:46.153 --> 22:48.607
attacking a. c., making up stories ?

22:48.701 --> 22:52.071
you know, if i didn't know any
better, i'd think somebody was jealous.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.861
is she great or what ?

23:01.280 --> 23:02.125
arthur.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.051
call me a. c.

23:05.397 --> 23:07.358
man, i thought i had the hookup,

23:07.757 --> 23:10.164
but the way you
flak-jacketed that c4...

23:10.634 --> 23:12.372
ugh, that was awesome, bro.

23:12.407 --> 23:15.072
i was just trying to stop a
bomb you were gonna set off, bro.

23:15.119 --> 23:16.385
yeah. nice work.

23:17.160 --> 23:20.353
thanks to you, the oceans are one
step closer to becoming a graveyard.

23:20.776 --> 23:24.052
that thing you were trying to blow up, it
has something to do with all the dead fish ?

23:24.146 --> 23:25.189
no, not something...

23:25.600 --> 23:26.433
everything.

23:27.243 --> 23:28.958
it's a sonar weapon called leviathan.

23:29.275 --> 23:33.584
it emits some kind of focused sound wave that
packs enough punch to rip a submarine in half.

23:33.795 --> 23:34.729
how do you know that ?

23:35.328 --> 23:37.376
i peeked at some documents at the lab.

23:38.022 --> 23:40.088
they had "luthorcorp"
stamped all over them.

23:42.766 --> 23:45.243
you mean lex is trying to
develop some sort of weapon ?

23:45.349 --> 23:47.932
one that also happens to
kill any sea life around it...

23:48.437 --> 23:49.987
even when it's on standby.

23:51.478 --> 23:54.296
in four hours, he's demoing
leviathan for the pentagon.

23:54.965 --> 23:58.922
if they bite and start dropping these things
in the water, it'll be an ecological disaster.

24:01.435 --> 24:02.885
we have to stop him.

24:03.261 --> 24:04.400
i'll go talk to lex.

24:04.435 --> 24:05.774
there isn't enough time.

24:06.408 --> 24:09.707
come on, superboy. with you on the turf and
me in the surf, we could stop this thing cold.

24:09.742 --> 24:11.404
by blowing up his lab ?

24:12.015 --> 24:14.704
well, i'm not gonna sit back
and let this happen, clark.

24:15.396 --> 24:19.142
i was born with an amazing gift, and i
plan to use it to help protect this planet.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.971
i'm not gonna let you put
innocent lives at risk.

24:27.253 --> 24:28.697
like your buddy lex luthor ?

24:28.732 --> 24:30.115
he's not my buddy...

24:31.019 --> 24:32.774
not anymore. but i think
we can get him to listen...

24:32.798 --> 24:34.788
you think he doesn't know
what this thing does ?

24:35.193 --> 24:36.614
he doesn't care.

24:37.001 --> 24:40.354
you want to work together, then we go
clear this up with lex... that's the deal.

24:40.506 --> 24:41.293
all right,

24:41.504 --> 24:43.183
we'll try it your way, boy scout.

24:43.665 --> 24:45.356
let's have words with the cue ball.

24:59.008 --> 24:59.771
clark.

25:00.382 --> 25:01.603
you got here fast.

25:01.638 --> 25:03.000
thanks for seeing us, lex.

25:03.470 --> 25:05.689
well, i only have a few
minutes. i'm on my way out.

25:05.724 --> 25:06.887
yeah, we know, bro.

25:10.624 --> 25:12.843
now, i don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

25:14.064 --> 25:17.000
lex, this is my friend from
out of town... arthur curry.

25:17.892 --> 25:18.796
you have to stop it.

25:20.142 --> 25:21.128
stop what ?

25:21.962 --> 25:24.333
we know about the weapon
you're testing, lex.

25:25.108 --> 25:27.821
i guess the billions you make
from agriculture isn't enough.

25:29.805 --> 25:32.247
one day of college, and
he's already an activist.

25:32.940 --> 25:36.287
clark, the only weapon i'm developing
is the kind that fights hunger.

25:36.662 --> 25:39.585
my team's been working on a strain
of fast-growing high-protein kelp...

25:39.621 --> 25:42.544
leviathan has nothing to do
with feeding the hungry, luthor !

25:43.336 --> 25:45.743
it's a weapon that will
kill everything in the water.

25:45.769 --> 25:47.906
i'm sorry. who are you again ?

25:48.023 --> 25:50.324
someone that actually cares
about the world he lives in.

25:50.348 --> 25:53.407
you have to shut leviathan down. there's
other ways to defend this country.

25:53.618 --> 25:57.234
the days of you barging into my
home to give me sage advice are over.

25:57.269 --> 25:59.336
lex, whatever our differences,

25:59.359 --> 26:00.860
i don't want to see you get hurt.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.934
there are people who will do
whatever it takes to stop you.

26:04.957 --> 26:07.940
if you think i'm gonna bow down to
the thuggish tactics of extremists,

26:07.963 --> 26:09.769
you really don't know me very well.

26:09.804 --> 26:11.589
i told you this was a waste of time.

26:14.783 --> 26:15.511
arthur.

26:17.612 --> 26:19.495
you know, you're a real tool, lex.

26:20.071 --> 26:21.879
i hope you get what you deserve.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.247
i'm out of here.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.689
i got things to do.

26:28.264 --> 26:31.000
your new friend's got a
bit of an anger problem.

26:31.963 --> 26:34.887
he gets that way when someone's
trying to destroy what he loves.

26:35.133 --> 26:37.246
clark, i'm not trying
to destroy anything.

26:37.281 --> 26:39.312
lex, don't bother trying to cover it up.

26:39.770 --> 26:41.919
the days of me believing
your lies are over.

27:38.799 --> 27:40.536
why are you doing this to me ?

27:41.276 --> 27:42.051
one,

27:42.415 --> 27:44.059
you called me a tool.

27:45.550 --> 27:49.307
and two, most people i know need
scuba gear to breathe underwater.

27:50.453 --> 27:52.202
i'm just good at holding my breath.

27:55.361 --> 27:58.592
i...i guess i shouldn't be surprised
there's something unusual about you.

27:58.627 --> 28:00.847
i mean, you are a
friend of clark kent's.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.036
he doesn't know anything about this.

28:09.087 --> 28:10.366
how about some water ?

28:12.527 --> 28:13.942
i'm running a little thirsty.

28:14.270 --> 28:15.280
so am i.

28:17.018 --> 28:18.981
i have a thirst for knowledge,

28:19.403 --> 28:21.611
one that never seems to get quenched.

28:26.730 --> 28:28.277
what group are you with ?

28:29.275 --> 28:30.896
guardians of the sea ?

28:32.763 --> 28:34.771
i don't travel with an entourage.

28:37.835 --> 28:38.669
please... [

28:40.536 --> 28:41.945
...i need some water.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.510
now, i usually don't deny
my guests a drink, but...

28:48.568 --> 28:51.609
something tells me
if i give you water...

28:52.948 --> 28:55.989
...you'll bust out of those
restraints before the glass is empty.

28:58.502 --> 28:59.897
now, let's try again.

29:00.813 --> 29:03.267
how are you able to breathe underwater ?

29:05.122 --> 29:06.331
shut down leviathan,

29:07.905 --> 29:09.960
and i'll tell you
everything you want to know.

29:09.995 --> 29:12.261
<i>mr. luthor, leviathan is submerged.</i>

29:12.285 --> 29:15.607
<i>the clients are in the viewing
room. all systems are ready to go.</i>

29:17.110 --> 29:17.968
well...

29:19.447 --> 29:21.549
...i guess we'll have
to pick this up later.

29:22.265 --> 29:23.040
please !

29:23.351 --> 29:24.795
please. please.

29:27.578 --> 29:29.386
i don't care what you do to me.

29:30.701 --> 29:32.392
please destroy that weapon.

29:34.188 --> 29:35.033
wow.

29:35.949 --> 29:37.886
okay, you convinced me.

29:38.521 --> 29:43.710
i'll flush $100 million in "r" and "d" down the toilet
and put the nation's fleet at risk while i'm at it.

29:45.748 --> 29:49.505
you might be a big fish in the
water, but up here, i'm the shark.

30:00.472 --> 30:01.224
No !

30:11.160 --> 30:11.912
water.

30:56.195 --> 30:57.639
i knew i'd find you here.

30:57.709 --> 30:58.719
are you okay ?

30:58.895 --> 31:00.384
wet and ready, bro.

31:00.795 --> 31:03.167
the test is going down.
but security's everywhere.

31:03.331 --> 31:04.763
i'll never make it through in time.

31:04.799 --> 31:05.947
you might be able to...

31:06.452 --> 31:07.697
with a little help.

31:11.748 --> 31:12.499
gentlemen,

31:13.697 --> 31:15.247
i stand before you

31:15.279 --> 31:19.987
humbled by a technology that will forever
tip the balance of naval power in our favor.

31:20.257 --> 31:22.019
that's a bold claim.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.860
you'll see it with your own eyes.

31:25.557 --> 31:26.978
let the show begin.

31:28.258 --> 31:30.054
activating ranging system.

31:31.404 --> 31:33.518
modulator engaged.

31:36.473 --> 31:37.800
what the hell was that ?

31:42.614 --> 31:43.730
what's going on ?

31:48.078 --> 31:52.281
looks to me like mr. luthor's
miracle weapon just self-destructed.

31:52.775 --> 31:53.714
admiral.

31:54.054 --> 31:55.405
admiral, please.

32:16.624 --> 32:18.784
yes, admiral. i understand.

32:20.633 --> 32:22.888
i'm sorry to have wasted your time.

32:26.492 --> 32:27.314
clark.

32:28.253 --> 32:33.515
thought the next time i saw you, you'd be waving
a banner at some protest rally outside luthorcorp.

32:34.595 --> 32:38.869
you know, lex, i was thinking i'd write a paper on
that high-protein kelp you said you were working on.

32:39.456 --> 32:40.902
are there any new developments ?

32:42.616 --> 32:44.601
well, it's funny you should ask.

32:45.364 --> 32:48.968
the project was derailed by
a couple of misguided vandals.

32:49.504 --> 32:51.794
the equipment's damaged beyond repair.

32:53.919 --> 32:55.551
maybe it wasn't meant to be.

32:56.902 --> 32:57.782
maybe.

32:59.506 --> 33:01.033
say, how's your friend ?

33:01.444 --> 33:03.040
arthur ? i don't know.
i haven't seen him.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.766
well, if you bump into him,

33:05.083 --> 33:07.397
tell him i'm looking
forward to seeing him again.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.640
lex, do you ever stop and think
about where your life is heading ?

33:21.332 --> 33:22.565
all the time.

33:25.665 --> 33:27.778
it's a complicated world, clark.

33:29.516 --> 33:32.178
only the naive view
it in black and white.

33:33.998 --> 33:35.524
you know, the other day,

33:35.888 --> 33:37.320
a professor of mine...

33:38.236 --> 33:40.206
he accused luthorcorp of being evil

33:40.629 --> 33:42.519
and you being just short of the devil.

33:45.866 --> 33:48.413
well, you didn't tell him
about my pitchfork, did you ?

33:52.957 --> 33:54.225
i defended you.

33:59.952 --> 34:01.326
i guess i am naive.

34:17.146 --> 34:18.978
you got some awesome stuff in here, bro.

34:20.387 --> 34:23.726
yeah, i got the feeling the ocean
floor's a little more interesting.

34:24.033 --> 34:26.440
and it'll stay that
way now, thanks to you.

34:27.684 --> 34:29.281
well, i did have some help.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.373
we could make a pretty good team, huh ?

34:34.194 --> 34:37.623
maybe we should start up a junior
lifeguard association or something.

34:38.891 --> 34:41.333
i'm not sure i'm ready for
the j. l. a. just yet...

34:42.938 --> 34:45.252
unless you promise to
stop blowing things up.

34:46.791 --> 34:48.869
as long as luthor sticks to dry land,

34:49.221 --> 34:50.947
i'll keep the seafloor to myself.

34:52.795 --> 34:54.886
but if anyone messes with my home...

34:57.286 --> 34:59.869
look, i don't think leviathan's
gonna be a threat again.

34:59.904 --> 35:02.111
but lex might. he's seen your abilities.

35:02.428 --> 35:04.366
he'll turn the world
upside down looking for you.

35:05.835 --> 35:07.502
the world's three-quarters water.

35:07.925 --> 35:09.158
good luck finding me.

35:11.447 --> 35:13.514
what about school in miami ?

35:15.451 --> 35:18.120
guess the swim team will have
to find another handsome stud.

35:21.513 --> 35:23.122
just stay out of trouble, all right...

35:24.038 --> 35:25.001
a. c. ?

35:28.477 --> 35:30.098
try to get in some, clark.

35:33.057 --> 35:34.430
stay super, bro.

35:54.226 --> 35:58.500
if you've dropped my class, i
hope you haven't come to apologize.

35:59.404 --> 36:00.402
you were right...

36:02.155 --> 36:03.212
about lex.

36:04.093 --> 36:05.185
of course i was.

36:05.408 --> 36:06.805
i'll never lie to you, mr. kent.

36:07.349 --> 36:09.205
after all, i'm an educator.

36:09.228 --> 36:11.318
truth is my life's work.

36:14.794 --> 36:16.895
it might be too late,
but i was wondering...

36:17.835 --> 36:20.528
if the research-assistant
position was still available ?

36:22.020 --> 36:22.924
it is,

36:23.605 --> 36:26.284
but i'm not interested in hiring
someone who changes their mind

36:26.322 --> 36:28.000
as often as they change their clothes.

36:28.567 --> 36:30.986
professor, i can't just
sit back and watch anymore.

36:31.256 --> 36:34.684
and if your book is gonna expose the truth
about luthorcorp, i want to be a part of it.

36:38.310 --> 36:42.243
i expect my research assistants to be smart,
thorough, and show up to each and every class.

36:42.278 --> 36:43.640
i can guarantee it.

36:45.108 --> 36:45.824
all right.

36:48.924 --> 36:50.605
you know, history shows us that

36:50.699 --> 36:53.870
every decision a man makes has
an effect on the sum of his life.

36:55.549 --> 36:57.557
you've made the right
decision, mr. kent.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.628
you haven't learned, have you ?

37:06.262 --> 37:07.589
orange and green

37:07.636 --> 37:09.254
totally hideous together.

37:10.123 --> 37:11.696
i didn't think you were gonna show.

37:14.996 --> 37:16.534
i just wanted to say goodbye.

37:20.353 --> 37:21.609
you going to miami ?

37:24.685 --> 37:25.425
no.

37:26.423 --> 37:28.170
i think i'm gonna take some time off...

37:30.577 --> 37:32.139
float around for a little while...

37:33.113 --> 37:34.734
see where the currents take me.

37:36.554 --> 37:38.917
if those currents ever bring
you back to smallville...

37:43.637 --> 37:44.952
i don't think that's gonna happen...

37:48.931 --> 37:50.175
...not for a while.

37:54.262 --> 37:54.872
oh.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.450
you know, my first week of college,

38:38.533 --> 38:41.233
the only book i cracked open
was the "bartenders' guide," and

38:41.268 --> 38:43.340
even that was the cliff notes version.

38:43.727 --> 38:44.361
well...

38:45.394 --> 38:47.614
i guess we're two
different types of students.

38:47.649 --> 38:49.516
i hope so, for your sake.

38:51.635 --> 38:55.792
look, clark, i know that i got a little
thorny when you raised the red flag on a. c.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.549
i was just trying to look out for you.

38:59.878 --> 39:01.496
and i appreciate it.

39:02.471 --> 39:06.510
i've just never had someone to help guide me
through the shark-infested ocean of romance...

39:06.674 --> 39:08.741
not that i can't fend for myself.

39:10.008 --> 39:12.861
you know, i think i was
wrong about our friend a. c.

39:14.904 --> 39:16.630
he was a little misguided, but...

39:17.980 --> 39:19.742
his heart was in the right place.

39:20.928 --> 39:22.759
yeah, he was definitely unique.

39:27.315 --> 39:29.804
i've known a lot of guys
who want to own the world.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.112
i haven't met very many who
actually want to save it.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.939
how am i ever gonna meet
someone like that again ?

39:50.242 --> 39:52.171
lois, i promise, someday...

39:53.651 --> 39:55.788
you'll meet someone even more special.
