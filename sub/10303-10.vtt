01:21.040 --> 01:23.270
I once was lost

01:23.520 --> 01:27.832
But now I'm found

01:28.080 --> 01:30.116
Was blind

01:30.360 --> 01:36.071
But now I see

01:37.960 --> 01:41.396
Who would like to say a few words
on behalf...

01:41.640 --> 01:43.870
...of our dear departed teammate,
Skippy?

01:44.120 --> 01:45.633
I would.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.518
Who's paying for this?

02:04.800 --> 02:07.758
Well, the corpse of honour.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.519
Where were we?

02:11.760 --> 02:14.752
- Saying something nice about Skippy.
- Why don't you do it, Al?

02:14.960 --> 02:19.272
After all, you're the one that found him
wedged in the bathroom stall.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.472
Oh, all right,
like I haven't suffered enough.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.074
Skippy was a pal...

02:27.360 --> 02:29.316
...and our centre.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.632
And he was pound for pound the...

02:33.280 --> 02:35.748
Well, he's the fattest guy I knew.

02:37.280 --> 02:42.070
Hey, Al, could you hurry it up?
Halftime's almost over.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.874
And in conclusion, the end.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.153
All right, let's get a little life in here!

02:54.080 --> 02:56.275
Let's party!

03:05.520 --> 03:08.432
- Boy, I sure am gonna miss old Skippy.
- Yeah, what a guy, huh?

03:08.640 --> 03:10.153
Weighed 400 pounds.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.157
How could a guy let himself
go that way?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.316
I don't know.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.718
Hey, guys, the game's back on.

03:18.920 --> 03:22.708
And welcome back on to the Fox game
of the week here on Fox.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.196
But before we here at Fox return you
to the Fox game of the week...

03:26.440 --> 03:29.512
...we'd lik e to remind you
that you're watching Fox.

03:29.720 --> 03:35.590
We now return you to the Fox game
of the week already in progress on Fox.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.755
You know, if I could go back 30 years
in time, you know what I would do?

03:39.960 --> 03:42.428
Buy a second pair of pants?

03:43.880 --> 03:47.839
No, I'd come up with my own
little celebration in the end zone.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.593
Like the Ickey Shuffle.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.792
Earnest Givens' Electric Slide.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.879
In fact, if I was going to name my
All-Bundy dream team, every guy on it...

03:57.080 --> 03:59.913
...would have to know
how to party in the end zone.

04:00.120 --> 04:05.194
Like Billy "White Shoes" Johnson,
or Andre Rison, Butch Johnson...

04:05.400 --> 04:06.913
...and of course...

04:07.120 --> 04:10.032
Of course, me.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.552
Oh, what I wouldn't have given...

04:12.760 --> 04:16.435
...just to have been able to
spike the ball in, just one time.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.437
But I guess I have to
settle for being...

04:18.640 --> 04:21.552
...on the greatest undefeated team
in city history, hey, boys!

04:21.800 --> 04:23.916
- Hey! Hey!
- Number one!

04:24.120 --> 04:26.873
You guys weren't so great.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.713
You know, fella, there's already
one funeral in here today.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.800
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.436
I said, undefeated.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.274
You wouldn't have been
if you'd played us that year.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.272
Oh, yeah?

05:00.680 --> 05:02.591
And who are you?

05:02.840 --> 05:05.115
Jack Franklin.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.069
I was halfback
at George S. Patton High.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.436
Patton High.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.153
What's the deal with Patton High?

05:13.360 --> 05:15.749
They were the only other
undefeated school in the league.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.996
We were supposed to play
for the city championship...

05:18.200 --> 05:19.918
...but the game got cancelled.
- Why?

05:20.160 --> 05:22.833
Why? Because they were cheaters,
that's why.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.473
They used ringers.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.910
Guys 25, 30 years old.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.235
You had guys that old.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.517
They were there honestly.
They were stupid.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.953
Well, I think you're
all a bunch of pansies.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.428
Pansies?

05:41.680 --> 05:43.557
Pansies.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.672
Hey, didn't they just change
Patton High's name...

05:46.880 --> 05:49.519
...to Jacqueline Onassis High?

05:51.920 --> 05:52.989
Yeah.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.751
Yeah, and isn't the team now
known as the Jackie O First Ladies?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.389
First Ladies?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.758
I say we still would have
beaten you guys.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.474
And there is only one way
to settle it.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.633
And that is?

06:12.840 --> 06:16.230
So this Sunday we're going down
to the park, play football...

06:16.440 --> 06:19.750
...and settle this thing once and for all.
Isn't that great, Peg?

06:23.440 --> 06:27.592
No, Al.
Great would be if you flossed.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.437
Dad, not that the pride of watching
a middle-aged shoe salesman...

06:32.640 --> 06:34.995
...and friends
geezer up and down a football field...

06:35.200 --> 06:38.510
...until they vomit dust
won't be enough...

06:38.720 --> 06:40.995
...how are you gonna convince
anybody else to play?

06:41.240 --> 06:45.233
Yeah, that's true, Daddy. What if
the other teammates have lives?

06:46.280 --> 06:48.635
I wouldn't worry about that, pumpkin,
if I were you.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.159
These guys all look up to me.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.676
- Not really.
- No.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.912
And besides, the pride of the team
is at stake here.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.838
Most of the guys
are already here, Peg.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.993
You know Rodent and Bob Rooney
and Buster and Speedy.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.670
I called Thad, our quarterback, in
California. He's flying in this morning.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.917
Dad, aren't you
forgetting something?

07:10.160 --> 07:13.436
Well, I'm trying to, son,
but she's sitting right there.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.633
I meant your centre, Dad.
Who's big enough to replace Skippy?

07:17.840 --> 07:20.718
That, I am proud to say,
is something I have thought of.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.152
Hup one, hup two!

07:37.720 --> 07:41.633
I gave him some of your mother's
sweat pants she grew out of, Peg.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.797
I even think
I'm gonna break my old record.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.073
And this time
I'm gonna spike the ball!

07:53.760 --> 07:56.558
I just hope our quarterback, Thad,
still has his throwing arm.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.275
What am I saying? Thad's
the kind of guy that never changes.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.518
Hi, Al, it's me, Thad.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.871
Al, you look...

08:15.520 --> 08:17.397
...just great.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.471
Thad, you look...

08:22.320 --> 08:24.709
...like a freaking woman.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.398
- Thad.
- Peggy.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.068
I thought you dropped off
the face of the earth.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.794
Well, not all of me did.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.279
I just love your dress.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.039
And I just love your hair.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.269
- Darling.
- Darling.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.718
So, what are you guys gonna do
with the extra cup?

08:54.360 --> 08:55.998
Oh, I get it.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.395
It's a gag!

08:59.240 --> 09:01.310
Oh, you always were a joker.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.159
That's a good one, Thad.
Well, the ball's in my court now.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.919
Oh, Thad.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.751
I had to do it, Al.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.599
All those years, I felt like a woman
trapped inside a man's body.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.155
I just got so tired of it.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.709
Yeah, but, we...
We all get tired of our cars too...

09:32.960 --> 09:35.474
...we don't rip the doors off.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.558
Now, how are we gonna beat
the First Ladies without a quarterback?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.510
Jack Franklin.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.234
What brings you
to the undefeated neighbourhood?

09:53.440 --> 09:56.716
We heard your quarterback
is a woman.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.549
Not bad.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.518
Kind of overdid the ta-tas, though.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.318
That's not our quarterback.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.755
Then who is she?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.956
I don't know.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.750
I'm Thad.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.000
I'm sure.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.672
Still got your arm, Thad?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.553
You make the call.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.274
- Sunday, Bundy.
- We'll be there!

10:40.520 --> 10:42.795
With bells on.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.072
- How are you feeling, Al?
- Feel good, feel strong.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.838
Nothing can stop me today.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.270
Oh, Al.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.596
I feel bad, I feel weak.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.312
Now, honey,
how long is this game gonna take?

11:14.520 --> 11:15.748
And I mean long for me.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.554
Not long for you, which is about
three and a half minutes.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.520
You see, Peg,
the thing is it's meant to be fun.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.312
I mean fun for me,
not fun for you...

11:23.520 --> 11:26.990
...which is shouting instructions
with a mouth full of crackers.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.759
And what's she doing here?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.675
I am here in support
of my sister-in-arms, Thad.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.838
I hope that she wins
and somehow you don't.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.476
I'm sorry, little boy.
Did you lose your parents?

11:41.680 --> 11:43.432
Hey, Daddy.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.790
I have that cheer
you wanted me to write.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.878
Finally, someone here
who's on my side.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.469
- Let's hear it, pumpkin.
- Okay.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.793
Daddy!

12:10.120 --> 12:11.712
To think you weren't planned.

12:11.960 --> 12:16.829
All right, Kelly. Let's go find our seats
before all the good ones are taken.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.631
I am so glad my Jefferson doesn't have
to prove his manhood in this way.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.230
- Where is he?
- At home dyeing my shoes.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.669
Well, if it isn't Jerk and the Fatman.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.273
- Ready to get your ass kicked, Bundy?
- Nice colours, Franklin.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.391
You look like
a box of Good & Plenty.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.275
Good & Plenty.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.590
Let's get it on.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.278
Hey, wait for me.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.591
Okay, Franklin, now remember
this ain't high school.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.758
- No cheating, no ringers.
- Same for you guys too.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.872
All right, let's get the referee here.
Yo, ref!

13:09.920 --> 13:11.990
Okay. The coin toss, gentlemen.

13:12.240 --> 13:16.518
Ready, son... Bud... Ref.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.068
Where's the coin?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.312
Damn, and I left my purse in the car.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.470
We can't start the game
if we don't flip a coin.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.716
- Call it in the air.
- Oh, God.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.911
Tails.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.030
Tails it is.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.032
It's your kick.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.272
Hey, Al, don't some of the First Ladies
seem a little big to you?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.708
Well, age will do that.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.559
You know, look at Barbara Bush.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.635
Seeing Daddy out on the field of honour
like the first time you ever saw him...

13:57.840 --> 13:59.717
...it must be really exciting for you.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.950
Next on Oprah...

14:08.600 --> 14:11.160
I got it! I got it!

14:12.840 --> 14:15.434
Daddy caught it, Ma.
He's at the 20.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.278
He is in the 20.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.278
He's under the 20.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.393
- Way to block, guys.
- We...

14:30.600 --> 14:32.830
We thought you were gonna go
all the way.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.076
Your helmet did.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.352
Thank you.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.511
Al, there's something wrong.
I don't think these are the First Ladies.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.070
Of course they're the First Ladies.
Who the hell else would they be?

14:49.520 --> 14:51.272
Excuse me.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.716
Anybody here lose
a Super Bowl ring?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.238
Excuse me, sir. I lost one.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.957
All right now, boys, remember,
the honour of Polk is at stake here.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.752
Besides,
we can't let our fans down.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.073
Al, it's cold.
We're gonna go home, okay?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.470
Peg, we're trying to huddle here.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.511
You never wanna huddle with me.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.718
Well, put a helmet and a face mask on
and we'll talk about it.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.591
All right, the hell with our fans.
This one's for us and...

15:28.800 --> 15:31.758
And Baywatch's Pamela Anderson.

15:38.760 --> 15:42.196
Hey, number 56.
You don't look like Morty Fishbein.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.032
Well, I am, you schmuck.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.037
Who'd ever thought
little Morty Fishbein...

15:47.240 --> 15:49.276
...would grow up to look like
Lawrence Taylor?

15:49.520 --> 15:52.637
Think that's something, Eddie Yim
grew up to look like Bubba Smith.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.791
Shut up.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.234
Same old Eddie.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.069
Except now he appears to be
a giant black man.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.554
Hey, Al.
I'd swear that's Rod Martin...

16:03.800 --> 16:06.155
...Hacksaw Reynolds
and Kenny Stabler over there.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.834
Jefferson, there's nobody over there
but pink punks.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.838
And what do Polk High Panthers do
to pink punks?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.469
Pulverize the powder puffs!

16:15.200 --> 16:16.633
Let's rock.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.990
- Had enough, Bundy?
- I have not.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.431
Neither have I. Who said that?

17:45.960 --> 17:48.793
Come on, Al. You okay?

17:55.320 --> 17:56.594
Two-minute warning.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.158
Look, Al, I may not know anything
about the First Ladies...

18:01.360 --> 18:04.670
...but I know a ringer when I see one.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.239
And you, sir, are a ringer!

18:20.640 --> 18:23.552
- Bubba!
- Oh, no.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.315
So just going out
for some milk, huh?

18:27.880 --> 18:29.279
Well...

18:29.640 --> 18:32.791
The Snake, L.T. And Hacksaw
were gonna play.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.752
If I didn't play...

18:34.960 --> 18:37.713
...they'd call me a sissy
and give me the business.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.873
Holy moly, here come the wives.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.116
Talking about
your fearsome foursome.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.634
Well?

18:43.880 --> 18:46.713
Baby, have I told you lately
how pretty your eyes look?

18:46.960 --> 18:50.555
Oh, really?
And what colour would they be?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.310
So you are Lawrence Taylor.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.272
And you are Kenny Stabler.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.869
And you are Hacksaw Reynolds.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.071
And you are Rod Martin.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.316
And you are...

19:08.800 --> 19:11.519
...Eddie Yim.

19:11.720 --> 19:15.156
Franklin, you cheating pink weenie.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.828
- So you did use ringers.
- Like we needed them.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.793
You guys couldn't score
with your own wives.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.716
And we're proud of that.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.998
We can score on you.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.476
New game. Sudden death.
And I don't care if it takes all night.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.192
Excuse me, Dad. Your permit
for the field runs out in 10 minutes.

19:33.960 --> 19:38.556
And I don't care if it takes 10 minutes,
which is nine more than I need.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.119
If I don't personally score on you...

19:42.360 --> 19:47.354
...I will dance totally nude at the sports
bar in front of everybody...

19:48.600 --> 19:53.196
...except Thad and the wife.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.193
Then we both win.

20:36.760 --> 20:40.639
I did it. I did it! Polk rules!

20:44.200 --> 20:45.428
- Dad...
- Out of my way, son.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.911
- You're in my spotlight.
- You spiked it on the 5-yard line.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.599
What?

21:07.200 --> 21:09.953
What is it with you football guys?

21:10.160 --> 21:13.038
You pound on each other,
you abuse your own bodies...

21:13.240 --> 21:14.958
...why do you do it?

21:15.440 --> 21:18.398
- It's a man's thing.
- Yeah.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.954
- Commitment to excellence.
- And it gets you out of the house.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.110
But most of all, we do it for pride.
