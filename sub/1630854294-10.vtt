WEBVTT

00:13.103 --> 00:14.000
<i>Oh,</i>[bleep] <i>me.</i>

00:15.000 --> 00:16.344
Parker has pulled me off
a loader.

00:16.448 --> 00:18.965
He really needs help
organizing this Alaskan trip.

00:19.068 --> 00:22.275
In true Parker style,
he's left all of this to
the very last minute.

00:22.379 --> 00:26.172
He's super busy here.
Like, this operation alone
is so much going on,

00:26.275 --> 00:28.586
there's so much dirt to move
out there.

00:28.689 --> 00:31.482
We were understaffed
and yeah, it's just chaotic.

00:31.586 --> 00:35.862
So, I can understand.
It's clearly fallen to
the back of his mind.

00:35.965 --> 00:39.482
But yeah, it can't keep
falling by the wayside,
because there is a lot to do,

00:39.586 --> 00:41.137
and zero time.

00:43.379 --> 00:46.551
I hate being in this
situation but...

00:48.413 --> 00:51.413
...seems like I constantly
find myself in this kind
of situation.

00:58.758 --> 01:01.034
<i>Ten weeks into
the season,</i>

01:01.137 --> 01:05.000
<i>it's crunch time for
27-year-old Parker Schnabel.</i>

01:06.551 --> 01:11.896
<i>He's stripped over half
the massive
90-acre airstrip...</i>

01:12.000 --> 01:16.275
<i>...and is now mobilizing
his new
Alaskan operation.</i>

01:19.931 --> 01:23.310
Well, everything for Alaska's
starting to come together,

01:23.413 --> 01:27.379
except kind of the main
component, the wash plant.

01:27.482 --> 01:30.206
<i>We ordered one
when we were in New Zealand.</i>

01:30.310 --> 01:33.206
But then, a little after that,

01:33.310 --> 01:36.482
I changed wet screens before
putting it in,

01:36.586 --> 01:39.689
because I wanted them
the same as our other plants.

01:39.793 --> 01:42.517
And caused it to be
fairly late.

01:43.379 --> 01:47.103
Later than we anticipated
or wanted.

01:48.482 --> 01:51.310
This Alaskan project is,
you know, important for us

01:51.413 --> 01:53.068
down the road for
our future and...

01:53.965 --> 01:55.137
we gotta find a wash plant.

01:56.896 --> 01:59.620
So, we'll go out and see
what we can find.

01:59.724 --> 02:03.448
And if we can find something
that works for us, and works
for the owner, then, um...

02:04.758 --> 02:05.620
...could be in business.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.620
Or... not.

02:12.965 --> 02:17.068
<i>Parker needs to be
mining in Alaska this season,</i>

02:17.172 --> 02:23.413
<i>or risk losing a 100 ounce,
$180,000 down payment.</i>

02:27.827 --> 02:29.655
- Hey, Tyson.
- How's it going, guys?

02:29.758 --> 02:31.586
So, Mitch and I are heading
over to Alaska.

02:31.689 --> 02:33.275
- Okay.
- Just for a couple
of days.

02:33.379 --> 02:35.862
You know, Parker gone,
myself gone, that's gonna
leave you

02:35.965 --> 02:38.413
to wrangle the reins there.

02:38.517 --> 02:41.241
- Or crack the whip or whatever
you wanna do, but...
- Yeah.

02:41.344 --> 02:43.448
...we gotta keep the dirt
flying, right?

02:43.551 --> 02:45.482
Well, I hope you guys find
what you're looking for
in Alaska,

02:45.586 --> 02:48.758
and get some boots
on the ground.

02:48.862 --> 02:50.689
- And get a gameplan
together for...
- We'll be fine.

02:50.793 --> 02:53.344
You're the one
I'm worried about.

02:53.448 --> 02:56.896
Well, hopefully, you can keep
the rubber side down, Tyson.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.620
Yeah, I'll do my best.

02:58.724 --> 03:00.448
- All right, I'll meet you down
the airstrip? All right.
- Sounds good, man.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.793
All right. Let's get the hell
out of here.

03:08.413 --> 03:12.034
I'm hoping I can prove to
Mitch and Parker that

03:12.137 --> 03:14.517
I can have this under control,
and they can go off to Alaska

03:14.620 --> 03:15.965
<i>and get things squared
away there.</i>

03:16.068 --> 03:18.586
<i>Potentially, secure a future
for the mine.</i>

03:18.689 --> 03:21.137
'Cause we're running out
of ground in the Yukon.

03:25.655 --> 03:27.344
My visa's come through...

03:28.482 --> 03:29.689
...for The States.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.827
So I'm excited to go
to Alaska.

03:32.931 --> 03:34.827
But I just, yeah, I don't know
about leaving here.

03:34.931 --> 03:36.793
They just need as many people
as possible.

03:38.793 --> 03:41.517
It goes forward
and backwards, amazing!

03:42.862 --> 03:44.448
Bad spot.

03:44.551 --> 03:46.896
Like, hang on. I got myself
into a pickle.

03:49.586 --> 03:52.034
<i>Stand-in foreman,
Tyson Lee</i>

03:52.137 --> 03:57.103
<i>needs to keep Sluicifer
and Big Red running
side-by-side...</i>

03:57.206 --> 04:01.000
<i>...and hit a target of
450 ounces,</i>

04:01.103 --> 04:04.103
<i>$800,000 of gold,</i>

04:04.206 --> 04:05.551
<i>by the end of the week.</i>

04:08.586 --> 04:11.517
It's all hands on deck,
you know, I mean...

04:11.620 --> 04:15.793
Poor Tyson. He's got his
hands full running this
whole operation by himself.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.413
And we're falling behind
on everything.

04:21.517 --> 04:26.551
So I told him I'll help him
out whenever and wherever
I can.

04:26.655 --> 04:29.448
<i>I don't know if I'm doing
any good, but I know I'm not
doing any damage.</i>

04:32.551 --> 04:35.896
Oh, shoot.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.413
I think I just piled all
that dirt where I gotta
dig a ditch.

04:44.758 --> 04:46.758
Yeah, I got here
at the start of May.

04:46.862 --> 04:50.344
<i>Uh, it's been fun.
Never run equipment before.</i>

04:51.517 --> 04:53.310
<i>New hire
Jacob McClure</i>

04:53.413 --> 04:56.586
<i>is clearing discarded tailings
for both plants.</i>

04:58.620 --> 05:01.206
<i>And keeping an eye out
for any problems.</i>

05:02.448 --> 05:04.517
<i>Yeah, it's definitely
not the easiest thing</i>

05:04.620 --> 05:06.068
<i>to keep up with
the tailings right now.</i>

05:18.137 --> 05:19.551
Oh, [bleep].

05:21.896 --> 05:22.724
Shut it off!

05:28.000 --> 05:30.206
Wanna grab
the pry bar and a shovel?

05:35.827 --> 05:38.000
Oh, the pre-wash
jammed up on us.

05:39.413 --> 05:42.000
So, just gotta get 'er
cleared out.

05:44.068 --> 05:48.413
<i>Big Red's paydirt
conveyor has overloaded
the shaker deck.</i>

05:48.517 --> 05:53.379
<i>Unwashed rocks
are overflowing into
the distribution box below,</i>

05:53.482 --> 05:55.172
<i>blocking the sluices.</i>

05:55.275 --> 05:59.379
<i>The only way to clear it is
to shut down the shaker deck,</i>

05:59.482 --> 06:01.413
<i>and remove
the blockage manually.</i>

06:07.965 --> 06:09.241
Good thing I was close.

06:10.172 --> 06:13.724
But just gotta get her
freed up...

06:15.827 --> 06:17.448
...and back
to washing her off.

06:20.551 --> 06:21.862
Wanna pass me that shovel?

06:31.034 --> 06:34.655
<i>Tyson is off
to a bad start.</i>

06:34.758 --> 06:37.724
<i>Every hour that Big Red
is not washing paydirt</i>

06:37.827 --> 06:41.827
<i>costs almost $4,000 in lost
gold production.</i>

06:45.241 --> 06:47.413
- Wanna close the main?
- Close the main.

06:49.827 --> 06:54.448
You know, this just goes to
show how much [bleep] is
going on around here.

06:55.931 --> 06:58.000
The day-to-day basis is...

06:58.103 --> 07:00.689
It's a lot for one guy
to keep his eyes on.

07:02.137 --> 07:03.793
How do our screen decks look,
Alex?

07:04.827 --> 07:06.241
Yeah, no, it's still
all there.

07:12.793 --> 07:15.517
We should be back up
and running here momentarily.

07:15.620 --> 07:20.103
Just gotta clear out
all this debris so this thing
sits flush.

07:23.034 --> 07:25.758
- Yeah, how much
do you want the main open?
- All the way.

07:29.137 --> 07:31.275
And this should be pretty
good to go.

07:31.379 --> 07:33.724
I'm gonna get back to
what I was doing and...

07:33.827 --> 07:36.620
- ...you can get back to
feeding the beast.
- Sweet.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.758
Everyone clear?

07:50.068 --> 07:52.344
There's just a lot
of [bleep] going on.

07:52.448 --> 07:54.758
I came over to take a look
at Big Red, and good thing
we did,

07:54.862 --> 07:58.965
'cause it piled up pretty much
as we got here, so...

07:59.068 --> 08:01.241
<i>...we got her cleared out,
got her back running.</i>

08:02.000 --> 08:03.275
It's time to get back to work.

08:17.448 --> 08:20.862
Well, right now we're
loading and washing
the excess clay

08:20.965 --> 08:22.379
We got a long way to go yet.

08:22.482 --> 08:26.344
But we're making good progress
and couldn't be happier.

08:26.448 --> 08:28.655
<i>Deep in
the Yukon wilderness,</i>

08:28.758 --> 08:31.206
<i>the Clayton brothers are
desperately trying</i>

08:31.310 --> 08:33.827
<i>to turn their family
fortunes around</i>

08:33.931 --> 08:36.275
<i>by hitting it big gold mining.</i>

08:43.000 --> 08:45.655
We gotta have good cleanups
to keep going

08:45.758 --> 08:48.103
because we're using the gold
we find

08:48.965 --> 08:50.448
to buy more fuel.

08:50.551 --> 08:54.689
So, if we have
clean up, then, we're
basically in a tough spot.

08:54.793 --> 09:00.103
<i>Short on cash,
the Claytons plan to mine
hotspots along the creek,</i>

09:00.206 --> 09:03.689
<i>creating a pay-as-you-go
road to Golden Acres,</i>

09:03.793 --> 09:07.965
<i>ground they hope will deliver
their 500-ounce season gold.</i>

09:11.448 --> 09:13.137
This is a booster seat.

09:13.241 --> 09:18.068
It is... I think it's
just memory foam
in a pillow case.

09:18.172 --> 09:20.517
But it does work for
short people like me.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.586
See? Makes me
nice and boosted.

09:25.275 --> 09:26.275
I can see now.

09:28.103 --> 09:31.103
<i>The brothers'
16-year old sister, Janae</i>

09:31.206 --> 09:34.793
<i>trucks pay from Brandon
at the S-bend cut,</i>

09:34.896 --> 09:37.517
<i>a third of a mile down
the creek road,</i>

09:37.620 --> 09:41.965
<i>to where Brady is feeding
pay into their wash plant,
Dirt Devil.</i>

09:45.896 --> 09:48.379
It's definitely
stressful being up here,

09:48.482 --> 09:52.275
just having to make money

09:52.379 --> 09:55.517
to keep things running
and keep things running
at home.

09:57.137 --> 09:59.000
My whole family works
really hard.

10:00.965 --> 10:04.551
<i>The Clayton family
are living on a knife edge.</i>

10:05.206 --> 10:07.172
<i>Ten weeks into the season,</i>

10:07.275 --> 10:10.413
<i>they've mined just under
12 ounces of gold.</i>

10:11.310 --> 10:14.103
<i>They now need ten ounces
every week</i>

10:14.206 --> 10:17.068
<i>to keep their gold mining
dream alive.</i>

10:19.896 --> 10:21.689
If we don't get ten ounces,
we're done.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.103
Which, that's not good.

10:26.206 --> 10:29.586
<i>We need to keep things running
to keep things running
at home.</i>

10:37.241 --> 10:38.862
<i>To speed
up production,</i>

10:38.965 --> 10:42.965
<i>they've just taken delivery
for an old 336 excavator</i>

10:43.068 --> 10:45.413
<i>from their family
construction business.</i>

10:48.068 --> 10:52.379
We wanna wipe that
500 ounce season gold right
off the face of this planet.

10:52.482 --> 10:55.310
We'll have that trommel
down to Golden Acres
before we know it.

10:56.551 --> 10:58.758
It's kind of full speed
ahead now.

10:58.862 --> 11:01.103
We're up and running now.

11:02.206 --> 11:03.689
<i>So far so good.</i>

11:06.689 --> 11:08.310
Why the
am I losing power?

11:10.448 --> 11:11.482
What the [bleep]?

11:34.379 --> 11:36.172
Uh, Bran, you got a copy?

11:37.103 --> 11:38.827
Yeah, Brady.
Go ahead.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.586
<i>Yeah, the 336
is down. There's something
wrong with the engine.</i>

11:55.896 --> 11:57.344
What are you doing?

11:57.448 --> 11:59.448
Well, I noticed it
started bogging.

12:00.931 --> 12:03.827
No power, and then I spun,

12:03.931 --> 12:07.482
and noticed all
the black smoke coming
out of the exhaust.

12:07.586 --> 12:12.758
<i>At California
creek, the Claytons are
at a standstill.</i>

12:12.862 --> 12:16.034
- Need help?
- Um, you wanna grab me
a hammer?

12:17.793 --> 12:20.586
<i>After being on site
for only two days,</i>

12:20.689 --> 12:23.172
<i>their second excavator
is down.</i>

12:25.103 --> 12:27.724
Willing to bet my life
it's a turbo.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.275
Which is...

12:31.103 --> 12:34.034
...[bleep] news because
they're not cheap.

12:34.137 --> 12:38.862
They're not fun to put in
and it just means down time. So...

12:38.965 --> 12:42.862
<i>The turbo uses
high pressure exhaust gases</i>

12:42.965 --> 12:46.413
<i>to send compressed air
into the engine cylinders.</i>

12:46.517 --> 12:49.206
<i>Without it, the excavator
is dead.</i>

12:51.206 --> 12:53.655
It just sucks that this had
to happen up here,

12:53.758 --> 12:56.344
where we're not a hop,
skip and a jump away from
a parts store,

12:56.448 --> 12:58.034
we're more of a week away.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.068
Well, pipe's off.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.103
I don't know anything about
turbo repairs.

13:10.068 --> 13:12.172
Well, the turbo ain't working.
It doesn't spool.

13:13.379 --> 13:15.448
We'll just wait till
Brandon comes back.

13:15.551 --> 13:17.689
- Okay.
- 'Cause he's [bleep].

13:18.448 --> 13:20.000
What a happy camper he'll be.

13:27.034 --> 13:28.448
I think the turbo's [bleep].

13:29.862 --> 13:30.965
Let's have a look.

13:32.241 --> 13:34.724
It does wiggle up
and down a tad,
like, the bolt.

13:34.827 --> 13:36.517
Well, a tad is okay.

13:36.620 --> 13:37.862
It doesn't slide.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.758
Can you put your
hand in that way,

13:41.862 --> 13:42.931
and see if it spins one way,

13:43.034 --> 13:44.931
and I'll see if it spins
on this side?

13:45.034 --> 13:46.827
This should just spin freely.

13:46.931 --> 13:48.103
Is it turning there or no?

13:49.068 --> 13:50.310
No, it's not moving.

13:58.448 --> 14:01.620
I don't [bleep] know what
it means.

14:01.724 --> 14:05.413
It means that we're waiting
and our extra hull was
supposed to help us out.

14:05.517 --> 14:07.275
But now, we're just back
to square one.

14:09.724 --> 14:13.206
<i>The Claytons are
now down to just one
working excavator.</i>

14:14.586 --> 14:17.000
<i>But it's up the creek,
digging pay.</i>

14:24.551 --> 14:26.517
Hey, Brady,
I got a plan.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.068
Yeah? About what?

14:28.172 --> 14:31.310
We're gonna put
the 349 on double duty.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.241
Loading a rock truck
and feeding the plant.

14:34.344 --> 14:38.793
So, you want this thing
walking a kilometer
back and forth?

14:38.896 --> 14:42.068
- When it only does
three miles an hour?
- Yeah, well...

14:42.172 --> 14:44.275
I don't know what else to do.
You got another plan?

14:44.379 --> 14:46.965
No, but I'm just saying like,
that's gonna be hard on
the rails...

14:47.068 --> 14:48.965
Yeah, it's not
gonna be easy.

14:49.068 --> 14:52.241
But we'll all go load some
trucks and let's, uh...

14:52.344 --> 14:53.758
- ...start hauling.
- Yeah, okay.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.896
<i>Brandon's plan?</i>

14:59.000 --> 15:03.310
<i>Use the excavator
at the S-bend
to stockpile paydirt.</i>

15:03.413 --> 15:06.793
<i>Then, walk it a third of
a mile upstream</i>

15:06.896 --> 15:09.000
<i>and use it to feed Dirt Devil.</i>

15:20.172 --> 15:21.448
Plan's to do double duty.

15:21.551 --> 15:24.103
Um, it's our only option.

15:24.206 --> 15:26.896
It's just gonna put a lot
of wear and tear on the 349.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.517
But it is what it is,

15:28.620 --> 15:30.379
and it's hopefully
gonna pay off.

15:50.655 --> 15:53.310
So, Megan, are you
cooking up there yet?

15:53.413 --> 15:54.965
Hey, Ruby. Oh, yes.

15:55.068 --> 15:57.758
Freaking hot today.
How you doing over there?

15:57.862 --> 16:00.931
Yeah, I had a little
cloud cover there
for a minute.

16:01.034 --> 16:03.344
and I like, jumped for joy
in my seat.

16:03.448 --> 16:07.586
[on radio] <i>Did you
actually jump, though?</i>

16:07.689 --> 16:09.862
<i>I did a very
excellent seat dance.</i>

16:09.965 --> 16:12.448
That's awesome.

16:16.137 --> 16:19.896
<i>The Beets crew
is running paydirt from
two of the deepest cuts</i>

16:20.000 --> 16:22.103
<i>ever mined at Paradise Hill:</i>

16:23.103 --> 16:25.482
<i>The Blue Cut and the Cold Cut.</i>

16:34.379 --> 16:36.620
<i>Nearly halfway
through the season,</i>

16:36.724 --> 16:41.241
<i>Tony Beets has mined
906 ounces of gold,</i>

16:41.344 --> 16:43.965
<i>less than a fifth of
his season goal.</i>

17:03.413 --> 17:05.551
<i>To make up
for lost time,</i>

17:05.655 --> 17:09.103
<i>the crew are stockpiling
a recently thawed pay layer</i>

17:09.206 --> 17:12.000
<i>and running the trommel
at max speed.</i>

17:14.310 --> 17:17.931
<i>We try to get out
as much pay as quickly
as possible.</i>

17:18.034 --> 17:20.931
<i>It's just, you know,
a constant race against time.</i>

17:22.931 --> 17:26.551
<i>And, you know, this trommel
chews through at least,</i>

17:26.655 --> 17:29.241
<i>I would say,
300 yards an hour.</i>

17:34.379 --> 17:35.655
Oh, [bleep].

17:40.206 --> 17:41.000
No, no, no!

17:56.034 --> 17:57.965
Kevin, do you copy? Kevin?

17:58.068 --> 17:59.655
I need you over here
at the plant.

18:03.965 --> 18:07.965
I looked over at the valves
and there's a huge tear.

18:08.068 --> 18:10.137
So, we have a piece of
the belt here that got
caught and ripped

18:10.241 --> 18:13.896
from all the way over there,
about 15 feet.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.482
Pretty much all we can do
with a fix like this.

18:15.586 --> 18:17.000
You can't really patch it.

18:18.689 --> 18:21.344
I mean, a waste
of [bleep] time, so...

18:21.448 --> 18:23.379
And we don't have a belt
to switch out with this one.

18:23.482 --> 18:25.551
So, like, we got one option.

18:34.172 --> 18:35.793
The belt has tracked
over a lot.

18:35.896 --> 18:37.827
Like, it's really running on
that side.

18:37.931 --> 18:41.586
And that's probably why
something got caught.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.482
I think I pretty much
got everything trimmed that
I need to.

18:48.517 --> 18:50.793
Okay. Away with you.

18:51.758 --> 18:54.379
Ah, all right.
Now, I'll run the belt,

18:54.482 --> 18:56.344
get the adjustment
back to normal,

18:56.448 --> 18:57.241
go from there.

18:58.448 --> 19:00.413
Ruby's gonna fire it up,
get the ball turning.

19:00.517 --> 19:03.379
We're just gonna see how
it tracks this way, that way.

19:03.482 --> 19:05.034
Make some adjustments
in the back.

19:06.689 --> 19:10.379
I need to adjust my belt
a [bleep] hair and a half.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.068
Chunky [bleep].

19:21.620 --> 19:24.758
So, we fixed the rip
in the belt but she's still
tracking over.

19:24.862 --> 19:27.000
That's probably 'cause we got
some [bleep] roller.

19:37.482 --> 19:38.310
This is not good.

19:39.896 --> 19:41.344
So, not only our roller
is [bleep],

19:41.448 --> 19:43.068
but our impact bed is as well.

19:45.931 --> 19:48.482
<i>Where the hopper
feeder meets the conveyor,</i>

19:48.586 --> 19:52.862
<i>a steel and rubber impact bed
absorbs the impact force</i>

19:52.965 --> 19:55.000
<i>of large rocks
as they hit the belt.</i>

19:57.655 --> 20:01.896
<i>But hard running has worn away
the shock absorbing rubber,</i>

20:02.000 --> 20:05.137
<i>allowing the full force
of rocks to hit the belt,</i>

20:05.241 --> 20:06.931
<i>damaging the rollers,</i>

20:07.034 --> 20:09.896
<i>causing the belt to track over
and rip.</i>

20:13.482 --> 20:15.448
Yeah, as you can see...

20:17.413 --> 20:19.310
...she's worn down to
the heart of plastic.

20:20.310 --> 20:22.241
Can't [bleep] of the belts.

20:22.344 --> 20:24.068
So, the impact bed's
got some wear and tear in it.

20:24.172 --> 20:25.620
It's time to replace it.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.586
It's gonna mean a shutdown,

20:26.689 --> 20:28.620
but if we don't
replace it now,

20:28.724 --> 20:29.931
it's gonna
something up.

20:30.034 --> 20:31.620
And then we're gonna have to
do a lot more [bleep] work.

20:36.310 --> 20:37.896
I got two out already,
you can see.

20:42.517 --> 20:43.517
Well, no. No.

20:50.448 --> 20:52.068
Mm-hm. I know. I know.

20:56.137 --> 20:57.000
Yeah.

20:57.620 --> 20:58.413
All right.

21:02.758 --> 21:04.724
- Here it is.
- Hello.

21:04.827 --> 21:06.965
We're gonna need some
replacement parts.

21:11.655 --> 21:13.620
Could you ship it
to me ASAP?

21:14.862 --> 21:16.965
Yeah, if that's the fastest,
then that's the fastest.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.448
Okay. All right. Thanks.

21:20.241 --> 21:21.000
Bye.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.137
- All right.
- What's the word?

21:25.241 --> 21:29.275
Um, so he says the fastest
he can get here is
three to four days.

21:29.379 --> 21:30.241
Holy [bleep].

21:30.965 --> 21:31.758
Yeah.

21:34.413 --> 21:37.655
<i>With their only
working wash plant now down,</i>

21:37.758 --> 21:41.310
<i>a four-day delay due to
the supply chain crisis</i>

21:41.413 --> 21:45.275
<i>could cost the Beets a quarter
of a million dollars.</i>

21:48.827 --> 21:50.965
Because we didn't
have parts on site.

21:51.068 --> 21:54.896
This is why I keep trying
to get Tony to have stuff

21:55.000 --> 21:56.344
ready on site.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.275
It does put a lot of
extra pressure on me

21:58.379 --> 22:00.137
when we're just waiting
on parts.

22:00.241 --> 22:02.793
'Cause, you know,
half the time, it ain't
fix it,

22:02.896 --> 22:04.379
it's having the
to fix it.

22:22.034 --> 22:25.241
When I come down Gold Stream,
what turn...
What left turn do I make?

22:26.655 --> 22:30.206
<i>After a 300 mile
flight to Fairbanks,</i>

22:30.310 --> 22:33.827
<i>Parker and Mitch
are on a hunt
for a turnkey wash plant</i>

22:33.931 --> 22:36.275
<i>and are chasing their
only lead.</i>

22:39.758 --> 22:42.241
I don't like
renting wash plants,
or borrowing wash plants.

22:42.344 --> 22:45.000
They just, they take a beating
and they take
a lot of maintenance,

22:45.103 --> 22:49.620
and it's never worked out well
when I've seen them get leased
to other people.

22:49.724 --> 22:50.517
Yeah.

22:54.896 --> 22:56.000
There's a wash plant.

23:01.068 --> 23:01.862
Mmm-hmm.

23:03.379 --> 23:04.758
At least it's not a trommel.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.896
- Hi, Wayne.
- Hey, Parker.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.965
<i>Local miner
Wayne Peppler has just
finished reconditioning</i>

23:12.068 --> 23:15.793
<i>this 150-yard-an-hour
shaker deck.</i>

23:15.896 --> 23:18.310
So, I hear you're
interested in a wash plant,
or looking for one.

23:18.413 --> 23:22.310
Yeah, so we ordered one
that's being built now,

23:22.413 --> 23:24.724
but it's gonna be, like,
super late.

23:24.827 --> 23:28.034
- Mm-hm.
- Like, hopefully ends up
before the season's over.

23:28.137 --> 23:30.586
But because of that,
we're looking for something

23:30.689 --> 23:32.724
that's gonna be
a stop-gap for us.

23:32.827 --> 23:34.241
Yeah, well, here she is.

23:34.344 --> 23:36.896
We can go through it
and look at it and see
what you think. And...

23:37.000 --> 23:38.310
Sweet, yeah.
Let's check it out.

23:46.586 --> 23:49.482
We're running inch and a half,
half inch on Big Red,

23:49.586 --> 23:50.724
it works really good.

23:50.827 --> 23:53.862
This looks like one inch
top panels, here.

23:58.586 --> 24:02.172
<i>Parker must decide
if it's worth gambling his
Alaskan season</i>

24:02.275 --> 24:04.689
<i>on this untested wash plant.</i>

24:07.241 --> 24:08.000
Uh...

24:09.517 --> 24:11.413
I'm gonna check it out
in the mouth, here.

24:12.172 --> 24:15.379
Framework up top looks good.

24:15.482 --> 24:16.724
Plant's in really good shape.

24:16.827 --> 24:19.482
- Yeah, it hasn't
seen much dirt.
- No.

24:19.586 --> 24:21.068
Parker,
you found the trap door?

24:21.172 --> 24:22.517
Yeah.

24:23.827 --> 24:25.689
So, I re-drilled all
the hydraulic refills.

24:25.793 --> 24:28.448
I cleaned them out,
I blew them out.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.724
We've tried to make it work
with hydraulic refills before

24:31.827 --> 24:34.172
but it's just always been...

24:34.275 --> 24:36.379
- Problematic?
- Just a million things could
go wrong, you know?

24:39.586 --> 24:40.896
Could probably use some
fine tuning.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.724
And we definitely have to
probably change a few things.

24:43.827 --> 24:46.310
Are you planning on
using this plant this year?

24:46.413 --> 24:47.793
- No. No.
- Gotcha.

24:47.896 --> 24:50.413
I have family.
A five-year old.

24:50.517 --> 24:52.241
Remodeling a house.

24:52.344 --> 24:56.137
So, I guess the big
question then is,

24:56.241 --> 24:59.206
what your interests are
in terms of,

24:59.310 --> 25:02.793
do you wanna like,
lease it out to us--

25:02.896 --> 25:04.758
Like, are you interested in
leasing it out to us,

25:04.862 --> 25:07.068
or are you looking at
selling it, or what's your...

25:07.172 --> 25:08.793
I think I'd be interested in
leasing it.

25:08.896 --> 25:12.827
What's uh...
What's this thing going for?

25:12.931 --> 25:15.344
Is it a monthly plan,
a weekly? How do you rent it?

25:15.448 --> 25:17.344
Uh, by the yard? What's the...

25:18.448 --> 25:21.379
By the yard? I like
by the yard.

25:21.482 --> 25:24.310
Well, it just has to be
real, real cheap if it's
by the yard, right?

25:24.413 --> 25:25.862
Like, what's your thoughts?

25:25.965 --> 25:28.379
You're not gonna use
the plant enough to
really wear it out.

25:28.482 --> 25:30.758
You're just gonna use it
to, you know, buy you
some time.

25:31.827 --> 25:34.000
And it's gonna work out
the bugs for me,

25:34.103 --> 25:35.275
it's not gonna wear out
the plant.

25:35.379 --> 25:36.379
Ultimately, it's a win-win.

25:36.482 --> 25:39.068
Yeah, and we would
probably need the plant for...

25:39.172 --> 25:41.517
...six weeks, I would guess?

25:41.620 --> 25:43.620
You can use it as long
as you want.

25:43.724 --> 25:45.034
You know, maybe even
the next year.

25:46.448 --> 25:49.413
Okay. The last time
we rented a plant,

25:49.517 --> 25:52.551
you know, I think we paid
like, 25 grand a month
for that plant.

25:52.655 --> 25:55.689
And I'm sure that we can find
somewhere, you know,
in that range,

25:55.793 --> 25:57.413
or hoping.

25:57.517 --> 25:58.965
Well, whatever
you need.

25:59.068 --> 26:01.275
You know, I think we're
probably gonna come to
a good solution. So...

26:01.379 --> 26:03.034
- Something that works
for everybody.
- Mm-hm.

26:03.137 --> 26:05.172
All right, well,
I'll get back with Mitch,

26:05.275 --> 26:07.689
and we'll have a chat
with each other about like,

26:07.793 --> 26:09.344
what we're thinking
and what's going on.

26:09.448 --> 26:11.344
Mm-hm.

26:11.448 --> 26:15.137
Well, I mean, I really wish
that the plant you'd ordered
was here and ready.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.344
- Yeah.
-'Cause renting something
kind of just feels like

26:17.448 --> 26:19.172
- wasting money.
I don't know, like...
- I know.

26:19.275 --> 26:21.931
- I think it's a pretty
good looking plant.
- Yeah.

26:22.034 --> 26:25.137
I would think that Wayne would
be pretty reasonable when
it comes to price,

26:25.241 --> 26:26.517
it sounds like.

26:26.620 --> 26:29.931
Like, I don't think he's
expecting us to be like,
some, like...

26:30.034 --> 26:32.344
...walk off into the sunset
with a duffel bag
full of cash,

26:32.448 --> 26:35.896
'cause he got you and I to
agree to some stupid...

26:36.000 --> 26:39.034
All in all, I mean, I think
it's, you know, probably
work out for everybody,

26:39.137 --> 26:40.896
'cause we can make some
improvements on that thing

26:41.000 --> 26:43.275
- and make it a lot better
than what it is.
- Yeah.

26:43.379 --> 26:46.862
He'll have a proven wash plant
that's been out washing rocks.

26:46.965 --> 26:49.344
Yeah, and hopefully we'll have
a bunch of gold in our pocket.

26:49.448 --> 26:52.068
Yeah, and I mean,
you know that any time
you fire something up,

26:52.172 --> 26:54.379
you're gonna have to work
some bugs out of it. Right?

26:54.482 --> 26:56.620
- All right, well this is
a good option for us.
- All right. Sounds good.

26:58.137 --> 27:00.000
<i>Wash plant secured,</i>

27:00.103 --> 27:04.000
<i>Parker is now one stop closer
to mining in Alaska.</i>

27:04.793 --> 27:06.206
All right. Sweet.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.241
Has it got a name?

27:08.344 --> 27:10.448
Not yet. I figured I'll let
you guys do that.

27:10.551 --> 27:11.620
You're gonna be
the first ones running it.

27:11.724 --> 27:13.137
- So, um...
- Oh, yeah.

27:13.241 --> 27:16.137
Dude, what do you think?
I mean, it's long and red. Like...

27:16.241 --> 27:18.034
It's like Red Rocket here.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.724
I mean, I don't know.
We'll come up with
something good, but...

27:20.827 --> 27:21.965
First thing comes to mind.

27:44.448 --> 27:46.620
You know,
the plant's been down
for two days now.

27:46.724 --> 27:48.793
The 349 down there
loading trucks.

27:48.896 --> 27:50.310
We're unable to wash.

27:50.413 --> 27:53.000
We're losing valuable
sluice time but...

27:53.103 --> 27:56.103
There's no other option.
If we wanna get to
500 ounces this season,

27:56.206 --> 27:59.310
we gotta try and keep washing.

27:59.413 --> 28:03.965

brothers are battling to keep

28:07.517 --> 28:09.931
<i>Down to just one excavator,</i>

28:10.034 --> 28:14.931
<i>20-year old Brady has been
digging paydirt for two days.</i>

28:15.034 --> 28:18.310
<i>We were thinking,
We finally got the other
excavator up here,</i>

28:18.413 --> 28:20.551
<i>we're actually gonna be
getting ahead,</i>

28:20.655 --> 28:23.689
<i>and not falling behind like
we have been.</i>

28:23.793 --> 28:27.344
<i>But no. It just kicked us
right in the
teeth again.</i>

28:29.275 --> 28:30.724
Here we go.

28:30.827 --> 28:34.517
<i>Sister Janae
trucks the paydirt from
Brady to the plant</i>

28:34.620 --> 28:36.206
<i>to build up a pay pile.</i>

28:38.379 --> 28:39.275
It is what it is.

28:40.655 --> 28:41.551
Making money.

28:44.586 --> 28:46.724
Hey, Brady, you could
probably bring that 349 up.

28:46.827 --> 28:47.965
We have a good chunk
of pay here.

28:48.068 --> 28:49.655
We might as well start
running now.

28:49.758 --> 28:51.551
Okay, sounds good.
I'll be right there.

28:51.655 --> 28:53.103
<i>Good. I'll start
walking up now.</i>

28:54.103 --> 28:54.896
Okay.

28:59.758 --> 29:04.551
<i>Brady must walk
the excavator a painful
three miles per hour</i>

29:04.655 --> 29:06.241
<i>back to the wash plant</i>

29:06.344 --> 29:10.965
<i>and start loading pay as they
chase a ten ounce weekly goal.</i>

29:13.206 --> 29:16.482
Finally running dirt. I mean,
we've been piling up
for a while.

29:16.586 --> 29:18.896
And Brandon just gave me
the go-ahead to

29:20.206 --> 29:22.689
drive back up there and start
feeding Dirt Devil.

29:24.206 --> 29:26.517
I will get
the plant warmed up.

29:32.413 --> 29:33.172
There she goes!

29:47.689 --> 29:50.034
- Oh...
- Oh, what the
is going on with the hull?

29:50.551 --> 29:51.344
What?

29:53.586 --> 29:54.448
Hey...

30:02.034 --> 30:04.931
- Oh...
- Oh, what the
is going on with the hull?

30:05.034 --> 30:08.275
- What?
- Hey!

30:16.103 --> 30:18.793
Hey! Are you overheating?
Hey, are you overheating?

30:18.896 --> 30:21.000
Oh, you're blowing something
out there.

30:21.103 --> 30:23.586
Just swing to me
so I can get up there.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.000
You're blowing antifreeze
or something.

30:25.896 --> 30:27.137
No, no, no, like,
the other way.

30:31.655 --> 30:32.758
Must've blew a line.

30:35.655 --> 30:37.275
Warren, shut the drum off.

30:46.896 --> 30:48.793
- Is that coolant?
- Yeah.

30:49.758 --> 30:50.551
Kill it.

30:51.206 --> 30:52.448
Oh, yeah. It's the hose.

30:54.965 --> 30:59.344
<i>The Clayton
brothers are up the creek
without an excavator.</i>

30:59.448 --> 31:03.000
<i>If they can't fix it,
their season could be over.</i>

31:04.241 --> 31:07.586
We just noticed some
mist in the air.

31:08.793 --> 31:13.275
And the main coolant line
on the hull here broke.

31:13.379 --> 31:17.724
This is a vital, vital component
of the cooling system. So...

31:17.827 --> 31:21.137
Yeah, when this blows,
doesn't take long for
the motor to overheat,

31:21.241 --> 31:22.655
and possibly blow,

31:22.758 --> 31:26.551
So, I'm so glad we caught it
when we did.

31:26.655 --> 31:29.551
We're gonna have to take
that line off the 336.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.862
- Is it the same size?
- Yeah.

31:32.241 --> 31:33.344
Oh.

31:33.448 --> 31:35.793
<i>Their only option
to save their season</i>

31:35.896 --> 31:38.379
<i>is to cannibalize
the coolant hose</i>

31:38.482 --> 31:41.068
<i>from their other broken
down excavator.</i>

31:41.172 --> 31:45.344
Brandon and Warren up there,
they're gonna take the main
coolant line off of this thing

31:45.448 --> 31:48.724
and then we're gonna go to
the 349, put all the parts
in there.

31:48.827 --> 31:50.793
Luckily,
they're interchangeable.

31:54.517 --> 31:57.068
- One side off.
- Yeah, okay.
You should be good then.

32:19.793 --> 32:22.275
You know, I was
a little scared. I mean,

32:22.379 --> 32:25.862
if this thing goes down,
then we truly are [bleep].

32:25.965 --> 32:29.793
And we got lucky it was just
a blown hose.

32:29.896 --> 32:32.413
- And we even got luckier
that it was...
- Matched with 336?

32:32.517 --> 32:34.655
Yeah, that it matched
with 336. So...

32:40.586 --> 32:42.724
Okay, let's go fire it up
and see if she leaks.

32:43.931 --> 32:45.310
- Ready?
- Yeah.

32:46.379 --> 32:47.172
Clear.

32:54.413 --> 32:55.965
Guys, good to go.

32:56.068 --> 32:58.586
Rod cap can go on.
Pass me that.

33:06.034 --> 33:08.896
- Doesn't look like
it's leaking.
- No, sir!

33:09.000 --> 33:11.655
- Looks good.
- Okay, well let's go
haul some pay.

33:11.758 --> 33:12.620
Hell, yeah.

33:21.931 --> 33:23.827
You know, that was a
close one.

33:23.931 --> 33:25.931
We caught it just before
it overheated.

33:26.034 --> 33:30.103
<i>And luckily, the 336 has
the same hose.</i>

33:30.206 --> 33:32.068
It couldn't have gone
any smoother actually.

33:32.517 --> 33:33.310
<i>Great day.</i>

33:49.620 --> 33:52.241
We're gonna use the crane
to lift the belt up.

33:52.344 --> 33:55.862
Gives us a bit more play
when we're trying to slide in
these frames.

33:55.965 --> 33:58.310
<i>After four
days' downtime,</i>

33:58.413 --> 34:02.310
<i>the new impact bed and rollers
for the Beets' conveyor belt</i>

34:02.413 --> 34:03.931
<i>have finally arrived.</i>

34:04.896 --> 34:07.137
Ah! Up we go. Pull!

34:11.137 --> 34:14.275
Now to change these rollers,
throw in the new ones.

34:14.379 --> 34:16.793
Hopefully, we should be
ready to roll shortly.

34:19.137 --> 34:20.137
<i>Go for Kevin.</i>

34:28.344 --> 34:32.068
<i>Tony has always been
somewhat of a control freak.</i>

34:32.172 --> 34:34.931
<i>He likes to be in charge.
He likes to micromanage.</i>

34:35.034 --> 34:36.379
<i>That has not changed.</i>

34:38.206 --> 34:42.551
It'd be a little bit of
more... hands off approach
would be appreciated.

34:42.655 --> 34:44.620
But, old dogs, new tricks.

34:44.724 --> 34:46.034
Sometimes it takes a while.

35:07.034 --> 35:08.000
So, now...

35:09.448 --> 35:10.620
...gonna yank up
the frames...

35:12.034 --> 35:13.551
...bolt those in place,

35:13.655 --> 35:15.551
stick the rollers back in,
let the belt down.

35:22.206 --> 35:24.034
Now we just have to put
the rollers in.

35:37.862 --> 35:38.655
Yep.

35:39.482 --> 35:41.551
Well, it's looking good.

35:41.655 --> 35:42.551
It's looking good.

35:51.689 --> 35:53.758
Okay, and that's the last
one in.

35:53.862 --> 35:56.103
We just have to tighten
the bolts and bear down.

35:56.689 --> 35:58.034
Get the [bleep] rolling.

36:01.172 --> 36:02.586
<i>Rollers in.</i>

36:02.689 --> 36:05.620
<i>Now for the shock absorbing
impact bed.</i>

36:08.517 --> 36:10.551
Got most of them in already.
Just a few more to go.

36:10.655 --> 36:12.517
And then, we get the
sluicing again.

36:19.172 --> 36:19.965
Beautiful.

36:22.241 --> 36:23.689
Well, we're down...

36:23.793 --> 36:27.793
We're down quite a few days
waiting on the, uh, new ones
to come in.

36:29.931 --> 36:32.413
Which is a shame.
That is a lot of ounces
we did not catch,

36:32.517 --> 36:33.689
just 'cause we
weren't running.

36:35.034 --> 36:35.827
Yo!

36:37.103 --> 36:40.172
I just got the last one in.
Went pretty slick.

36:40.275 --> 36:43.241
They're really, relatively,
pretty easy to take
in and out. So...

36:43.344 --> 36:44.206
Very nice.

36:46.551 --> 36:47.344
Sounds good.

36:52.241 --> 36:53.827
Perfect. Okay!

36:55.724 --> 36:56.931
Miss Ruby, Miss Ruby?

36:58.103 --> 37:00.827
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- Ready to rock and roll?

37:00.931 --> 37:02.103
<i>I'm ready whenever
you are.</i>

37:03.310 --> 37:04.517
Okay, let's do this thing.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.000
See a conveyor.

37:13.206 --> 37:14.068
Damn, let's go.

37:19.931 --> 37:23.517
<i>Back up and
running, the pressure is on.</i>

37:23.620 --> 37:29.655
<i>To make up for lost time,
Tony needs his cuts
to deliver big gold.</i>

37:29.758 --> 37:33.620
It is necessary for us
to keep up with maintenance
and keep everything going.

37:33.724 --> 37:37.379
But being down, we are just
hemorrhaging money.

37:38.275 --> 37:40.310
We got a short season
to sluice.

37:40.413 --> 37:45.103
But hopefully,
that maintenance lets us
go even longer.

37:46.551 --> 37:47.344
Hello.

37:48.655 --> 37:49.517
Hey, baby. Can you pound it?

37:51.413 --> 37:53.689
Where's Uncle's nose?
Where's his nose?

37:53.793 --> 37:56.896
- Ooh, there you go.
Say bye!
- Pow! Bye bye!

37:57.000 --> 37:58.758
Yeah, there you go.

37:59.448 --> 38:00.310
Perfect.

38:08.517 --> 38:10.620
Here's the old girl
that's for sale.

38:10.724 --> 38:11.517
D9.

38:12.344 --> 38:13.275
Let's check it out.

38:15.206 --> 38:17.241
They want $150,000
for this thing.

38:17.344 --> 38:19.379
Looks like its spent
some time by the ocean.

38:19.482 --> 38:21.275
Or a fire.

38:21.379 --> 38:23.655
Come on, baby.

38:27.827 --> 38:30.862
So, right now, Parker's
pushing some dirt here
with this old CAT.

38:30.965 --> 38:34.172
There's lots of things on
a machine like this that
can go wrong.

38:34.275 --> 38:35.931
You don't wanna buy yourself
a problem.

38:42.344 --> 38:44.310
Dude, this thing
wails!

38:45.172 --> 38:47.517
Okay, well, we have
a bulldozer.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.896
Not the one we want.
But the one that chose us.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.620
Dude, you got so many
different bulldozers.

38:53.724 --> 38:55.931
Do you need this to
complete the collection?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.482
We're playing Bingo.

38:57.586 --> 39:00.689
In the game of Bulldozer Bingo
we're missing the D9.

39:00.793 --> 39:03.241
And then, when you get
them all, you just go,
"Dozer!"

39:03.344 --> 39:04.931
Like, "We got 'em!"

39:17.137 --> 39:18.586
- Hi, guys.
- Hello!

39:19.551 --> 39:20.344
Hello!

39:22.931 --> 39:23.724
Uh...

39:26.448 --> 39:27.586
Must be nice.

39:27.689 --> 39:28.862
- Whenever I bring it,
I have to get it myself.
- I know.

39:28.965 --> 39:30.827
I actually noticed that
as well.

39:30.931 --> 39:32.965
But I was like,
I wasn't gonna say anything.

39:36.206 --> 39:39.931
<i>The Beets family
have been down nearly
four days</i>

39:40.034 --> 39:42.379
<i>waiting for spare parts
for their trommel.</i>

39:44.655 --> 39:45.448
Yeah.

39:48.689 --> 39:50.137
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

39:53.137 --> 39:56.241
Yeah.

40:00.034 --> 40:01.206
And commenting.

40:01.310 --> 40:03.344
What do you think, honey?
Should we weigh up
some gold?

40:03.448 --> 40:04.896
- Mm.
-"Mm." Yeah.

40:06.413 --> 40:09.586
<i>To hit his
5,000 ounce target,</i>

40:09.689 --> 40:13.344
<i>Tony needs over 300 ounces
a week.</i>

40:16.448 --> 40:19.310
10, 20, 30,

40:19.827 --> 40:22.758
50, 60, 90,

40:22.862 --> 40:26.448
100, 130, 140,

40:27.241 --> 40:29.482
150.

40:30.172 --> 40:32.103
161.86.

40:33.724 --> 40:37.931
<i>over $290,000.</i>

40:38.965 --> 40:42.068
That takes us over
the 1,000 ounces.

40:42.172 --> 40:44.827
But that's still 4,000 ounces
away from the goal.

40:48.482 --> 40:51.068
It's a long ways away
so, we've got to step it up.

41:12.896 --> 41:14.344
You know, I just finished
cleaning the gold.

41:14.448 --> 41:16.517
We need ten ounces
to keep going.

41:16.620 --> 41:18.586
And I've seen a lot
of cleanups in my day

41:18.689 --> 41:20.586
and this one's gonna be
pretty [bleep] close.

41:20.689 --> 41:23.034
So, we'll see what the scale
has to say.

41:30.482 --> 41:31.862
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

41:31.965 --> 41:33.827
Here's the gold
weigh for the week.

41:33.931 --> 41:35.241
- Kind of a tough
week, eh?
- Yeah, I know.

41:35.344 --> 41:37.862
It was a really tough week.
I mean, we fought
with breakdowns.

41:37.965 --> 41:39.172
336 went down.

41:39.275 --> 41:42.448
I never suspected the 336
would be an organ donor.

41:42.551 --> 41:44.827
I mean, we had it
for what, five days?

41:45.137 --> 41:46.344
Uh, two.

41:46.448 --> 41:47.965
- Two days it was?
- Yeah.

41:48.068 --> 41:49.620
Holy [bleep]. I thought it was
longer than that.

41:49.724 --> 41:50.724
me.

41:50.827 --> 41:52.758
All in all, I think we had
a pretty tough week.

41:52.862 --> 41:53.931
So, I think we should...

41:54.034 --> 41:57.344
We need to see ten ounces
if we wanna keep going.

41:57.448 --> 42:01.517
And, uh,
we don't get ten ounces,
I don't know what to say.

42:02.482 --> 42:05.517
Might just have to
pack up and go home.

42:05.620 --> 42:10.724
But we only ran for two days,
so it's gonna be a pretty nip
and tuck cleanout, for sure.

42:10.827 --> 42:13.275
So, guys, well, I think
we should weigh 'er out.

42:13.379 --> 42:14.172
Yeah, I agree.

42:14.827 --> 42:16.517
See what we got.

42:16.620 --> 42:19.310
- it's the moment
of truth, guys.
- Here we go.

42:23.413 --> 42:27.241
One, two, three, four...

42:28.379 --> 42:30.827
five, six, seven...

42:32.137 --> 42:34.793
eight, nine...

42:37.310 --> 42:40.275
10.53.

42:40.379 --> 42:43.655
<i>over $18,000.</i>

42:43.758 --> 42:46.965
Holy [bleep], man.
That's close, man.

42:47.068 --> 42:49.724
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. [bleep] man.

42:49.827 --> 42:52.068
You know what, guys?
It's a low number.

42:52.172 --> 42:53.448
It's right on the borderline.

42:53.551 --> 42:55.931
But we gotta remember,
we only ran two days.

42:56.034 --> 42:57.793
So, that was pretty
good for two days.

42:57.896 --> 43:01.103
- Yeah.
- Look at what we've fought,
fought with all week.

43:01.206 --> 43:02.965
- And we still got ten ounces.
- Yeah.

43:03.068 --> 43:05.379
Can you imagine if we could
stay running all week?

43:05.482 --> 43:06.862
It'd be at least double.

43:06.965 --> 43:08.793
Only running two days
of the Aspen,

43:08.896 --> 43:10.551
and doing double duty
with that,

43:10.655 --> 43:12.517
I mean, the Aspen could
pay off.

43:12.620 --> 43:15.586
500 ounces is
absolutely tangible.

43:15.689 --> 43:18.620
Well, guys, good job.
We survived another week.

43:18.724 --> 43:21.310
- Yeah. Yeah,
let's get her done.
- Sounds good.

43:23.758 --> 43:27.241
I'm happy with that
gold weigh. We got the numbers
that we needed

43:27.344 --> 43:29.137
to get to next week.

43:30.137 --> 43:32.620
And the gold mining
season continues.

43:43.275 --> 43:45.965
So, T, you had a little
excitement this week, huh?

43:46.068 --> 43:49.620
Yeah, it was pretty busy,
trying to keep two wash plants
going in the Bear Cut.

43:49.724 --> 43:52.827
And Big Red, uh, had
a little mishap.

43:52.931 --> 43:55.413
- Forgetting the tailings?
- Forgetting to do
the course tailings,

43:55.517 --> 43:56.724
and it piled up into the...

43:57.896 --> 43:59.000
- Hey, hey.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

43:59.103 --> 44:01.379
- What up?
- How you doing, man?

44:01.482 --> 44:03.793
<i>Parker and Mitch
are back from Alaska.</i>

44:03.896 --> 44:05.206
How you doing, Mitch?

44:05.310 --> 44:08.310
<i>Just in time to see
if Tyson has proven himself</i>

44:08.413 --> 44:09.827
<i>as a stand-in foreman.</i>

44:09.931 --> 44:12.068
- How was Alaska?
- It was good.

44:12.172 --> 44:14.620
- Yeah.
- Guys get some stuff
figured out on the wash plant?

44:14.724 --> 44:16.758
- Yeah.
- We found us a wash plant.

44:16.862 --> 44:17.793
- I think so.
- Really?

44:17.896 --> 44:19.827
- Yeah.
- What kind?

44:19.931 --> 44:21.586
Oh, it's just a nice,
little screen.

44:21.689 --> 44:23.103
- Yeah, screen deck?
- Yeah.

44:23.206 --> 44:26.068
- Well, that's a major hurdle
right there, huh?
- Oh, for sure.

44:26.172 --> 44:29.103
Well, it wasn't too
disastrous here while
you guys were gone.

44:29.206 --> 44:30.689
I know, i was going to say,
how'd things go?

44:30.793 --> 44:32.724
We had a fairly
good week. You wanna see?

44:32.827 --> 44:34.034
Yeah,
let's check it out.

44:34.137 --> 44:34.931
Let's do it.

44:36.965 --> 44:39.620
- Which one is Red?
- Uh, the silver.

44:40.827 --> 44:41.862
Oh, yeah.

44:44.103 --> 44:46.000
Sorry, Tyson, I'm taking
your job.

44:46.103 --> 44:47.310
You can have 'er.

44:47.413 --> 44:52.241
<i>Tyson is chasing
a 450-ounce gold.</i>

44:52.344 --> 44:57.586
So, we got 10, 20, 30, 60...

44:57.689 --> 44:58.862
90, 100...

44:58.965 --> 45:01.034
130, 150.

45:01.137 --> 45:04.344
- 200, baby.
- 160, 180, two hundy.

45:05.793 --> 45:08.793
- Go ahead, Mitch.
- 251.9!

45:08.896 --> 45:10.310
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, huh?

45:10.413 --> 45:12.206
- Your baby's runnin', huh?
- All right. I like it.

45:12.310 --> 45:13.344
- Oh, come on.
- Your baby's running.

45:13.448 --> 45:14.517
Big Red did it.

45:14.896 --> 45:16.517
251.

45:17.758 --> 45:20.068
- This is Sluicifer.
- Come on, come on.

45:20.172 --> 45:22.275
- We have a 500 ounce bet.
- All right.

45:22.379 --> 45:25.000
- All right. 20, 50, 100.
- Come on.

45:25.551 --> 45:28.000
150, 160, 180,

45:28.482 --> 45:31.068
200, 230, 240,

45:31.172 --> 45:35.000
250, 280, 290, 300.

45:36.551 --> 45:39.172
323.55.

45:39.275 --> 45:40.827
So, where are we at
for the week?

45:40.931 --> 45:45.965
This week,
we have 575.45 ounces.

45:46.068 --> 45:50.689
<i>over $1 million.</i>

45:50.793 --> 45:53.137
- Yeah, well done.
- Is that the best cleanup
of the season so far?

45:53.241 --> 45:54.241
We'll do it again.

45:54.344 --> 45:56.379
- Whoa!
- T, that's your baby, buddy.

45:56.482 --> 45:58.620
- That was nice.
- Well done, man. Well done.

45:59.517 --> 46:01.413
- Good job, Chris.
- Yeah.

46:01.517 --> 46:02.517
Well, thank you.

46:02.620 --> 46:04.931
- Very nice, dude.
Very nice.
- Let's leave.

46:05.034 --> 46:06.241
All right.

46:06.344 --> 46:08.758
Let's go look at wash--
We can buy
that wash plant now.

46:08.862 --> 46:11.655
We don't need to be
here, obviously.

46:12.655 --> 46:16.344
For the season,
it's 2,928 ounces.

46:16.448 --> 46:18.758
Well, man, to think that
between last week
and this week,

46:18.862 --> 46:20.586
- 1,000 ounces.
- Yeah.

46:20.689 --> 46:23.827
That's pretty sweet. If we can
keep that rate going,
we'll be looking good. But...

46:23.931 --> 46:26.758
...now, the biggest thing
is just keeping dirt
ahead of these things.

46:26.862 --> 46:29.862
When you look at the area
we're getting through in
a week with those two plants,

46:29.965 --> 46:32.310
at the yardage they're at,
we're just like...

46:32.413 --> 46:35.413
I mean, roughly, like,
10,000 yards
in 24 hours, right?

46:35.517 --> 46:38.448
We're sluicing it
pretty quick.

46:38.551 --> 46:42.310
Just so you guys know,
I'm gonna start spending
a lot more time in Alaska,

46:42.413 --> 46:46.068
um, 'cause I gotta get
that ball rolling.

46:46.172 --> 46:48.931
I don't know what
my time split's gonna be.

46:49.655 --> 46:51.310
It's impossible to say.

46:51.413 --> 46:53.931
But, um, you guys have this
under control.

46:54.034 --> 46:55.206
What do you want me to do?

46:55.310 --> 46:56.482
'Cause I know at the start
of the year, you talked about

46:56.586 --> 46:58.241
me going over there
and helping you with
that, man.

46:58.344 --> 47:00.413
As much as we still got
ahead of us here,

47:00.517 --> 47:03.000
I think we got a lot
to deal with.

47:03.103 --> 47:07.965
I don't want to spread
you guys too thin.

47:08.068 --> 47:10.931
And I think that you spending
any more time away from here

47:11.034 --> 47:12.034
would do that,
don't you think?

47:12.137 --> 47:13.172
Definitely.

47:13.275 --> 47:14.655
Well, we'll just focus
on this.

47:14.758 --> 47:16.931
I mean, our goal for
the season's to get through
all the ground.

47:17.034 --> 47:20.103
And we're making headway
on it, the gold is starting
to come in,

47:20.206 --> 47:21.586
so, hopefully, we can keep
that up.

47:22.448 --> 47:23.724
See where we land.

47:23.827 --> 47:25.103
All right. Let's go eat
some dinner.

47:25.206 --> 47:26.689
- Let's do it, man.
- You guys got it
under control.

47:26.793 --> 47:27.896
- Thanks guys.
- Later!

47:29.310 --> 47:31.137
- You got this?
- Yep. I got her.

47:31.241 --> 47:32.482
I love a parade.

47:32.586 --> 47:34.551
- You need a hand?
- No, I got it.

47:34.655 --> 47:37.517
No, I'm all good. Yeah.
Good to see gold coming in.

47:39.827 --> 47:41.517
It's gonna be hard
to maintain that.

47:42.172 --> 47:44.620
But we pretty much have to.

47:44.724 --> 47:47.413
You know, just keep
those two plants running.

47:47.517 --> 47:50.517
And so,
this is the breadwinner.

47:50.620 --> 47:53.379
We need to get
this ground done.

47:53.482 --> 47:55.241
We know it's producing gold.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.344
Alaska might be hit and miss.

47:59.448 --> 48:02.310
You know, let him throw
the dice. We'll work.
