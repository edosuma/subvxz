00:02.068 --> 00:03.136
[man] Oh yeah!

00:03.203 --> 00:04.604
[Lauren] Oh yeah.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.107
[man] Oh yeah, you like that,
you like that don't you?

00:07.173 --> 00:08.341
[Lauren] Yeah I like that!

00:08.408 --> 00:10.543
[man] Oh yeah that is a
full Windsor knot baby.

00:12.000 --> 00:12.245
-[man] Yeah you like that?
-[Lauren] Oh yeah I like that.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.313
[man] Yeah.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.383
[groans] You're a
dirty little slut.

00:16.449 --> 00:17.417
Sorry, what did you call me?

00:18.000 --> 00:18.485
Oh I'm so sorry,
was that too much?

00:18.551 --> 00:21.121
I just, um, thought we'd
try a bit of role play.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.355
Oh, role play, fine.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.289
Are you sure?

00:24.000 --> 00:24.391
Yeah sorry, I didn't realise.
Carry on.

00:24.457 --> 00:25.825
Yeah? Okay great, thank you.

00:25.892 --> 00:29.095
[man groans]

00:30.330 --> 00:34.033
You little slut. Tell me
you're a little slut.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.068
I'm a dirty little...

00:36.000 --> 00:36.736
Did I say you could
fucking talk?

00:36.803 --> 00:38.004
Sorry are we still
doing role play?

00:38.071 --> 00:38.938
Yeah that's part of it.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.074
It's just difficult to...
It's a little bit confusing.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.509
[man] I'm in character.
That's fine.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.911
[man] Oh, there we go, yeah!

00:44.978 --> 00:47.614
[man groans]

00:48.000 --> 00:49.716
[Lauren groans]

00:54.000 --> 00:54.587
[man shouts] I'm going to put
a warrior baby in you.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.623
[man exhales]

01:00.000 --> 01:01.561
# I'm like a candle burning
End to end #

01:06.000 --> 01:06.866
[cuckoo, cuckoo]

01:06.933 --> 01:09.569
[Abby] Mum, did you know this
part of my foot hurts?

01:09.636 --> 01:11.704
And last night Daddy said he
would give me a plaster...

01:12.000 --> 01:14.974
[Lola] Two plaits tied together
at the back into one plait

01:15.041 --> 01:17.744
starting at the front but not
at the top, at the bottom.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.848
Oh, so two tied together into
one, but at the bottom?

01:21.915 --> 01:22.949
How many hairbands?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.952
Seriously? Two! I thought
you knew everything.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.053
I do know everything.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.288
You didn't know that.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.790
Why is your hair so knotty?

01:30.857 --> 01:32.192
Again, everything?

01:32.258 --> 01:33.193
Well that was rhetorical.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.327
I know why your hair's so
knotty

01:36.000 --> 01:37.530
because your dad never
bloody brushes it, that's why.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.667
No. It's knotty because
when I eat crackers at night

01:42.000 --> 01:42.735
the rats smell the food
and come into my bed

01:42.802 --> 01:45.472
and make my hair knotty.
Seriously.

01:45.538 --> 01:46.673
[knock on door]

01:46.739 --> 01:47.807
Abby!

01:48.000 --> 01:49.509
[knock on door]

01:49.576 --> 01:51.010
Oh, Abby!

01:51.077 --> 01:52.312
Can you just
hold that my love.

01:52.378 --> 01:53.480
Hang on.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.150
[phone beeps]

02:06.000 --> 02:07.126
Hey, just thought I'd
drop by with some kefir.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.229
What? What's that?

02:09.295 --> 02:11.731
Kefir. You said
you'd like to try it.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.967
Kefir! Thanks Matt.

02:14.033 --> 02:17.403
Fermented milk. Good
probiotics. I got this book.

02:18.000 --> 02:18.338
[Lauren groans]

02:18.404 --> 02:20.473
You mentioned you wanted some.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.075
Did I?

02:22.141 --> 02:23.810
-Yes, thank you.
-There you go.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.445
Oh appreciate that.
God, so much.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.813
Yeah it's a healthy yield.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.448
Hmm.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.084
Well thank you.
Gotta get the kids to school.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.986
Yeah, that's cool,
I've gotta um...

02:33.820 --> 02:35.688
..find some other
pointless hobby

02:36.000 --> 02:38.391
to fill the aching void
of my loneliness.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.459
[laughs]

02:39.526 --> 02:41.327
Sour milk, you're doing well.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.962
Right. I'm sure there's
something just as attractive

02:43.029 --> 02:44.597
for a soon to be divorced

02:44.664 --> 02:46.733
41 year old childless
man to be doing?

02:46.799 --> 02:47.600
[laughs]

02:48.000 --> 02:48.434
MacramÃ©?

02:48.501 --> 02:50.003
-Well there you go.
-Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:54.440
There I do go. So yeah.

02:54.507 --> 02:58.077
Thank you Matt,
for this off milk.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.420
[upbeat music]

03:07.487 --> 03:09.422
[phone beeps]

03:14.160 --> 03:16.095
Okay so, who's dick is this?

03:16.162 --> 03:17.964
I'm going to need a little
bit more context I think.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.899
Okay this dick...

03:19.966 --> 03:22.936
Oh God and that jar
is full of?

03:24.000 --> 03:24.003
-Apparently.
-Gosh!

03:24.070 --> 03:25.505
I mean a dick pic is
one thing but that's...

03:25.572 --> 03:27.106
Horrific! I know.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.575
Now that seems
like too much to me.

03:28.641 --> 03:29.275
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.378
Is he collecting it, because if
he is that is a police matter.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.546
One load allegedly.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.348
Oh, fuck off, get fucked,
that's fucked.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.417
-Hold this, I'm googling it.
-Well what you going to google?

03:42.000 --> 03:42.188
Ah, lots of sperm.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.990
Okay, could be Hyper...

03:44.057 --> 03:44.757
Hyperthermia?

03:45.258 --> 03:47.226
Yeah hyperthermia. He got
caught outside in a snowstorm,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.095
and now he produces an
inordinate amount of spoof.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.432
No. It's a very serious and
very debilitating illness

03:54.000 --> 03:55.401
where you have an
abnormally large load.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.905
Oh my God, there's
no way I'm meeting this man.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.640
-Causes dehydration.
-For me or him?

04:00.707 --> 04:01.541
Sorry, who is this again?

04:01.941 --> 04:04.811
Well that's it, I don't know.
It just came up my SnapTap.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.713
Didn't even know I had SnapTap.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.281
Yes, SnapTap.
That's what it's called.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.682
Is that the dance thing one?

04:09.749 --> 04:10.683
No!

04:12.000 --> 04:14.420
Anyway this semen junky is
using an anonymous account

04:14.487 --> 04:15.622
and won't give me his name.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.223
Oh well, put down some towels.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.025
The old ones,
not the good ones obviously.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.027
-Oh God Alex. Look at it.
-No.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.229
There isn't a condom
in the land,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.232
it would be like a water
balloon just filling up.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.166
[Alex moans]

04:27.233 --> 04:29.135
No, no, I'm off milk.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.510
So, he said this week. You've
got three dates this week.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.045
Why don't I just
cancel all of them.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.046
No!

04:42.000 --> 04:42.482
I will not be cowed by
a simple jar of semen.

04:42.548 --> 04:43.650
Okay, calm down.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.485
Well just find out whose
penis it is, and cancel them.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.020
Okay?

04:48.000 --> 04:48.321
So who's first?

04:48.388 --> 04:51.057
Ah, so first we have
Dallas Guitar Abs.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.892
-Okay, so that's Dallas.
-Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.293
Does it look like his penis?

04:54.360 --> 04:56.362
Right, so we are doing this?

04:56.429 --> 04:58.665
Here? In work hours we're
playing 'Dick Guess Who'

04:58.731 --> 04:59.766
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.168
Well his eyebrows
are kind of light.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.036
Yep.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.171
And Sir Cumalot's
pubes are darker.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.241
But do, you know, eyebrows
always match pubes, I mean...

05:08.307 --> 05:09.175
It's a good question.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.009
My eyebrows are quite...

05:10.209 --> 05:11.411
I don't want to know
the colour of your...

05:12.000 --> 05:12.845
Maybe I'll get him
to send another photo

05:12.912 --> 05:15.281
and give us more detail,
more to work with, you know...

05:15.348 --> 05:16.015
Right, yep, good idea.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.850
Your second date is...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.119
Sorry, have you
got a second date?

05:20.186 --> 05:23.589
Well not with the
same guy, but yep.

05:24.000 --> 05:24.757
So he didn't call?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.759
No, well who?
No, they all call.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.895
Oh, well that's really
tough, that's tough.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.531
I mean,
maybe you shouldn't, um,

05:31.597 --> 05:35.001
if you're going to sleep
with them straightaway.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.437
But I don't... I don't sleep
with them straightway.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.371
Well I do.

05:38.638 --> 05:39.672
Well if you're going to
give away the milk for free,

05:39.739 --> 05:40.740
why would they buy the cow?

05:42.000 --> 05:42.809
I don't want to sell the cow,
or them to buy it,

05:42.875 --> 05:46.045
or, fuck the milk, you know,
and also it's not 1952 Ange,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.115
people, women can have sex with
whoever they want can't they?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.650
-They can.
-I think so yeah.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.085
So you're finding it hard
to meet someone nice?

05:52.151 --> 05:53.152
I don't want to
meet someone nice.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.724
Well I suppose the options are
limited out there, by our age.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.125
[Ange laughs]

06:00.000 --> 06:01.427
Because all the good ones
are married aren't they?

06:01.494 --> 06:02.862
[Lauren] Well...

06:02.929 --> 06:05.264
Honestly I'm really
just looking for sex.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.599
[Alex] Sex.

06:06.666 --> 06:08.868
But you must want
a bit of romance?

06:08.935 --> 06:10.203
-Nuh.
-It's magic.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.804
I don't like magic,
don't like it.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.173
Wha, what sort of guy are you
looking for do you reckon?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.074
Oh I don't know,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.045
looking for a really kind of
weird, clumsy, strange guy.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.781
Oh, right. Oh, ah!

06:24.000 --> 06:28.054
Ah, classic me,
clumsy and weird.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.292
[phone beeps]

06:33.826 --> 06:35.228
What? What's he saying?

06:36.000 --> 06:36.896
"Your turn first,
downstairs pic."

06:36.963 --> 06:39.232
You can't be serious?
You're serious.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.434
Okay, we'll take it
on your phone because

06:42.000 --> 06:42.401
you've got a
better camera.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.003
Absolutely not, not for me.
No thank you.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.404
I'm not going to
get the right angle.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.240
I just don't think I'm the
best person for the job.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.943
-Come on, Alex, please.
-What does he want to see?

06:54.000 --> 06:54.814
I don't know. I think maybe
the nice, the main bit.

06:54.881 --> 06:55.915
-The main bit?
-Yeah.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.717
It'll only take a second.

06:57.784 --> 06:58.951
-Okay?
-Jesus Christ.

06:59.018 --> 06:59.786
Please don't.
[door slams]

07:00.000 --> 07:01.587
-Okay, do I-
-Okay. Here we go.

07:01.654 --> 07:02.822
Go in, or not?

07:02.889 --> 07:04.891
-So, Okay.
-Oh, god.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.726
I'm not going to touch it.

07:06.793 --> 07:07.693
You're just going to have to-

07:07.760 --> 07:10.696
So, do you think this
should be on or off?

07:12.000 --> 07:12.732
Just around your
ankles is fine.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.400
I don't know if I can
get my legs wide enough

07:14.467 --> 07:15.468
if they're on.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.502
No, they're wide enough.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.472
Just why can't we do a
nice tasteful tit shot?

07:19.539 --> 07:21.507
Nickers on or off? On or off?

07:21.574 --> 07:22.975
I don't know how to answer
that.

07:24.000 --> 07:24.210
Here they are.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.378
Okay.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.712
Kneel down. Kneel down.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.581
That's it.
Good, good, good, good.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.650
-Okay.
-Is that it? You got it?

07:30.716 --> 07:32.418
-Yep.
-Is that wide enough?

07:32.485 --> 07:34.053
Yep, yep.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.488
-Now take it.
-Thank you, thank you.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.723
There's three to
choose from and um...

07:38.658 --> 07:39.458
..pants.

07:39.525 --> 07:40.359
Ah, okay.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.964
I'm just going to not have to
see you for a couple of hours.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.400
I might just AirDrop
this to my phone.

07:48.534 --> 07:51.504
[upbeat music]

07:51.571 --> 07:53.406
[Ange] Hello.
[Alex] Yep, hi!

07:56.475 --> 07:58.177
It doesn't seem to
have come through.

07:58.244 --> 07:59.445
Did you press 'Accept'?

08:00.000 --> 08:00.880
Isn't it automatic?

08:00.947 --> 08:02.014
No, it's not automatic,

08:02.081 --> 08:04.483
that's why they put the
handy 'Accept' button there.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.385
I'll send it again, Jesus.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.287
Okay.

08:08.354 --> 08:11.257
Now I really do
need some time

08:12.000 --> 08:13.259
and maybe a
peppermint tea actually.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.261
So how do I SnapTap?

08:18.764 --> 08:20.766
[children chattering]

08:20.833 --> 08:21.601
Hello!

08:21.667 --> 08:22.435
[Jake] Hiya.

08:22.501 --> 08:23.836
-Hi Mum!
-Some washing of theirs.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.137
What's that on your face?

08:25.204 --> 08:26.072
Dirty washing, my favourite.

08:26.138 --> 08:26.873
Cheek tats.

08:26.939 --> 08:27.740
Oh god.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.809
Hey, I got a calendar
reminder for tomorrow night.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.444
Permanent marker, really?

08:31.510 --> 08:32.445
Tomorrow night?

08:32.511 --> 08:33.779
Yeah, it's in
the joint calendar.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.680
What does it say?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.683
"Dallas Guitar Abs 7:00 PM."

08:37.750 --> 08:40.219
Is Abby learning guitar now,
I thought she was doing violin.

08:40.286 --> 08:41.654
Mhmm.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.555
Viola. Yeah.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.490
Oh, so Dallas is
her viola teacher?

08:44.557 --> 08:45.358
Yes.

08:46.626 --> 08:47.894
No.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.196
It's probably a client
in the wrong calendar.

08:50.263 --> 08:50.997
-Right.
-Guitar?

08:51.063 --> 08:52.498
I can do the guitar.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.533
But when are we supposed
to fit in lessons?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.401
No, baby, it's a mistake.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.636
Wow!

08:56.702 --> 08:58.170
Who did your hair?

08:58.237 --> 08:59.772
-Na...
-I did.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.340
[Lauren scoffs] Bull shit.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.342
YouTube.

09:03.409 --> 09:04.777
Oh, come on.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.879
You hardly even ever
brush her bloody hair.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.547
I do brush their hair.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.383
All right, sometimes.

09:10.449 --> 09:11.317
So Dallas.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.753
This is a person,
or a place?

09:13.819 --> 09:14.620
Mhmm.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.456
Remember I have Stanley's robot
dress-up party this weekend.

09:18.000 --> 09:18.591
-Yes!
-Oh yes, that's right, darling.

09:18.658 --> 09:19.558
Yes, I will help you with that.

09:19.625 --> 09:20.760
I'll wire something up for you.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.363
You do not need to worry
because I got this.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.231
Ta-da.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.634
But I thought we were going
to make something properly.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.069
It's a bit lame.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.404
No, I know.
But then I bought this.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.905
How much did that cost?

09:32.972 --> 09:34.407
Yeah, okay, well,

09:36.000 --> 09:36.909
we can make something, I'll
make something with you then.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.545
Dad needs to do the wiring,
voice recorder, lights.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.681
I can do it! I'll do it,
I'll figure it out.

09:42.000 --> 09:42.915
All right. Suit yourself.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.183
I'm out.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.551
I can always YouTube it.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.622
[tool beeping]

09:51.023 --> 09:52.425
Oh, look, for goodness.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.227
You accepted the dates
in the wrong calendar.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.830
Well, I didn't know
I had two calendars.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.565
It's all fixed.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.301
Why didn't you just
tell him it was a date?

10:02.368 --> 10:04.136
Because it's none
of his business.

10:06.000 --> 10:06.138
Sorry, it's just electricity.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.073
Yep.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.375
Thank you.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.911
Have we heard from captain cum?

10:12.000 --> 10:12.845
-Sir Cumalot.
-Sir Cumalot.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.814
No. But, I've had an idea.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.216
I'm going to get Dallas
to show me his woody

10:18.000 --> 10:20.119
before I commit and then
compare it to the photo.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.620
That's actually a
very good idea.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.521
Yeah.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.324
Uh.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.592
-Lauren?
-Mhmm.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.295
Okay, so this
is a Snap Story.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.363
Excuse me.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.598
Starving.
[Ange laughs]

10:32.665 --> 10:33.833
Lauren, we've got that meeting.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.401
We can just-

10:36.000 --> 10:36.535
Oh, should I, should I?

10:36.602 --> 10:38.070
No, it's okay. Thank you.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.841
So I've made a story?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.676
So how do I delete this?

10:43.743 --> 10:45.378
-Oh god, okay.
-So who has it?

10:45.444 --> 10:46.379
-So you sent this.
-Where has this?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.548
Yeah, so basically, you've sent
it in direct message to him,

10:49.615 --> 10:53.119
but you've also posted it
to all of your contacts.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.787
-All my contacts?
-Yeah.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.555
Okay. But, no, it's okay.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.024
Not everyone has this app

11:00.000 --> 11:00.393
and you can actually
see who's viewed it by,

11:00.459 --> 11:01.327
no, no.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.297
Yeah, but if you've done
it, you can't actually

11:06.000 --> 11:06.365
see who's opened it.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.068
So my

11:09.135 --> 11:10.202
vagina is just out there now?

11:10.269 --> 11:11.871
-Just the main bit.
-Yeah.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.339
It's all right,
it's just a vagina.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.573
Just a vagina.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.674
I've got a normal vagina.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.278
Power to the vagina,
you know?

11:20.279 --> 11:21.047
-Yeah?
-Mhmm,

11:21.113 --> 11:22.581
Definitely, definitely.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.651
[upbeat rock music]

11:29.121 --> 11:29.955
Wow.

11:31.123 --> 11:31.924
[Lauren sighs]

11:31.991 --> 11:33.359
Nice garage.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.630
Yes, oh, great, thank you.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.831
[man] So psyched you're here.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.066
Oh, it's good to be here.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.033
Shocking day.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.405
Mhmm.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.473
You thirsty?

11:48.841 --> 11:50.009
[man sighs]

11:50.076 --> 11:52.244
God, you're a babe.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.382
I don't have long before
I have to get back.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.616
Cool.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.652
So, get your penis out.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.519
Yeah, cool, cool.

12:00.853 --> 12:04.090
Hiya, would you just, would
mind listening to this?

12:04.156 --> 12:05.257
Oh.

12:06.000 --> 12:06.892
It's, I've been working
on it since we met.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.761
It's about... old women.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.162
-Oh, okay.
-I mean, experienced women.

12:12.000 --> 12:12.832
It's like, starts like.
[guitar strumming]

12:13.999 --> 12:16.335
# Gotta woman with
some class yeah #

12:18.000 --> 12:18.604
-Oh, thank you.
-That's you.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.473
# And a hot mama ass, yeah #

12:20.539 --> 12:22.041
Can I please see your penis?

12:24.000 --> 12:27.079
# She's a working woman,
Hell yeah #

12:30.000 --> 12:31.750
# And she's going to
Make me swell, yeah #

12:32.384 --> 12:34.753
Yeah, and so, there's like
a pre-chorus that's like...

12:34.820 --> 12:35.588
[man singing]

12:36.000 --> 12:37.289
It's sewn up.

12:37.356 --> 12:38.124
It won't take a moment.

12:38.190 --> 12:38.958
Oh.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.494
[man singing]

12:44.697 --> 12:46.632
-You're circumcised?
-Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.234
Oh, we're good to go then.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.837
[upbeat rock music]

12:51.904 --> 12:53.372
[man] Did you like it?
Did you like the song?

12:54.000 --> 12:54.473
Yeah.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.275
-Hyper what?
-Spermia.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.243
That's not real.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.044
Rosa, what do you want
on your sandwiches?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.113
Well, you don't look like
you got drenched in cum.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.483
No, but that's because
I compared Dallas' penis

13:04.550 --> 13:05.417
to the picture.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.119
Okay. That's not creepy at all.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.654
You planning on doing that
with all the other dates too?

13:08.721 --> 13:09.655
No. It's 50/50.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.125
Callum Salesmen, or Guido
Fireman are Superspermer.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.162
Oh, do you have
the app SnapTap?

13:16.228 --> 13:17.496
Dunno. Dave might. Why?

13:18.000 --> 13:22.234
Because I may have accidentally
posted a public vagina picture.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.035
Wait, what?

13:23.102 --> 13:23.936
Public vagina picture.

13:24.003 --> 13:24.904
What? No, hang on.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.039
Did you just say you posted
a picture of your vagina

13:27.106 --> 13:28.040
on SnapTap?

13:28.107 --> 13:29.508
-Just delete it.
-Wow, that is...

13:30.000 --> 13:31.143
Quickly, please.

13:31.210 --> 13:31.944
[Helena sighs]

13:32.011 --> 13:34.246
I think Jake's
got a girlfriend.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.114
Why?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.083
The girls came home in these
incredibly fancy plaits.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.752
Oh shut the front door, wait,

13:39.818 --> 13:40.753
What kind of plaits
are we talking?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.055
Perfect French fishtail plaits.

13:43.122 --> 13:46.192
And he said he did it
off a YouTube video.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.827
Um mm, no chance.
I would lose my shit.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.229
I mean possible
girlfriend, whatever,

13:50.296 --> 13:51.897
but do not touch my kid's hair.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.199
Plaits are a bit better
than yours, aren't they?

13:54.000 --> 13:54.033
Mhmm.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.202
Well, cheer up. Could be worse.

13:56.268 --> 13:59.905
You could be about to get
a face full of cum. Oh wait.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.540
Thank you.

14:02.408 --> 14:05.010
[upbeat music]

14:06.000 --> 14:08.180
Girls, please help me.
We're late, obviously.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.082
Mum, can we finish
my robot after school?

14:10.149 --> 14:11.817
Yes darling,
I promise we will.

14:12.000 --> 14:12.685
Okay, Come on Lola.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.453
I am making my bed.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.921
Yeah, that's the sofa though,
isn't it?

14:15.988 --> 14:17.590
Come on, I'm going
to count to 20,

14:18.000 --> 14:18.490

14:20.359 --> 14:22.328
Hey, that's not real counting.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.762
Yeah, but that means
you're not going to know

14:24.000 --> 14:26.298
when I get to 20 right? 16!

14:26.632 --> 14:28.067
Do you want me to do your hair?

14:28.133 --> 14:29.768
Nope, it's perfect.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.171
Yeah, Did daddy
really do your hair?

14:36.000 --> 14:36.809
Uh, Yeah, yeah,
Definitely not Nancy.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.311
Who's Nancy?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.512

14:42.000 --> 14:43.048
Yeah, we stayed with
her last weekend.

for the robot.

overnight without telling me

14:58.597 --> 14:59.365
where they are.

Yes, alright I-

What's wrong with me?

15:04.303 --> 15:05.137
Okay.

What about this?

So I was looking for a photo
of the girls to send to Mum

16:36.829 --> 16:39.431
[upbeat music]

16:39.498 --> 16:41.266
Where'd you say you got these?

16:42.000 --> 16:42.935
They were sent to a client.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.337
We're trying to work out if
we need to take out an AVA,

16:45.404 --> 16:46.872
just considering the evidence.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.541
Like a name tag on the jar.

16:49.608 --> 16:50.843
Well you do know
that's semen right?

16:50.909 --> 16:52.244
-Okay.
-Really? Is it, wow.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.115
Yeah, that's a 370 gram jar
right there, so about 710 mil.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.150
So what we're looking at there
is about 410 mil of semen.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.284
-Wow.
-Yep.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.587
Now the average man
ejaculates approximately,

17:01.653 --> 17:04.390
3.7 mil each time, so I hear.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.259
Now either that's over a
hundred loads of, sorry Lauren,

17:07.326 --> 17:10.162
semen, or this guy
has hyperspermia-

17:10.229 --> 17:11.330
-Hyperspermia.
-All right, okay, okay.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.732
And if you zoom in...

17:16.135 --> 17:17.136
That looks like-

17:18.000 --> 17:18.771
-A Flak jacket
-A flak jacket, yeah.

17:18.837 --> 17:20.706
What do firemen wear?

17:20.773 --> 17:21.540
Flak jacket.

17:21.607 --> 17:22.708
Oh, Guido Fireman, cancel him.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.109
Thanks Simon.

17:24.176 --> 17:24.910
Ah nah, all good.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.645
Alex, can I have a quick word?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.180
Yeah, sure Ange, what's up?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.818
Well yesterday I had an
AirDrop request from you

17:32.885 --> 17:34.953
and I assumed it was
for work, but then I-

17:36.000 --> 17:36.922
Sorry, an AirDrop from me?

17:36.989 --> 17:37.923
Yes, yes.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.725
And before I take
this any further,

17:39.792 --> 17:41.860
I thought I should
probably just check.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.298
-Is this a vagina?
-Christ!

17:48.000 --> 17:48.467
Ange! Sorry, that was
actually for a client.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.270
Yeah, we're dealing with some
highly sensitive imagery and...

17:54.000 --> 17:54.273
Okay. A client? Right, well,

17:54.339 --> 17:57.176
the protocol for sharing
digital imagery is pretty
strict.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.444
Highly sensitive,

17:58.510 --> 17:59.711
and Alex must have pressed
the wrong button.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.448
[Ange] Right. I see.

18:02.514 --> 18:03.949
Oh, good Lord.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.052
We're doing a range
of digital forensics

18:07.119 --> 18:10.522
on a range of genitalia and
Alex sent me some evidence.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.356
It's all my fault.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.224
Right.

18:12.524 --> 18:13.959
So I should probably just
delete this shouldn't I?

18:14.026 --> 18:14.927
-Yeah.
-Yes, yes.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.029
Gosh they're big these days,
aren't they?

18:18.096 --> 18:18.997
Sorry, what are?

18:20.165 --> 18:22.367
Phone screens, because in my
day they were much smaller.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.235
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.970
And this was quite confronting
and I got a shock.

18:25.037 --> 18:25.804
They're massive now, yeah.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.606
But I understand. Good, good.

18:27.673 --> 18:28.407
Thank you.

18:28.474 --> 18:29.875
Thank you Ange.

18:30.000 --> 18:30.843
Good.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.578
Thank you. Just delete it.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.880
Sorry Ange for the vagina.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.483
So that was where
the AirDrop went?

18:37.549 --> 18:41.753
Uh huh. You are the shittest
technology user in the world.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.989
You sent your main bit to Ange.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.524
She doesn't know it's mine.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.293
Do you think she
knows it's mine?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.762
[upbeat music]

18:54.000 --> 18:54.166
Mum, did you know Nancy
makes her own hummus?

18:54.233 --> 18:55.033
Really?

18:55.567 --> 18:58.136
Yeah, she says that shop bought
stuff is full of preservatives.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.605
You just need chickpeas.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.806
I know how to make hummus,
Abby.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.107
Then how come you never make
it?

19:02.174 --> 19:04.476
I don't have time
to make hummus,

19:06.000 --> 19:06.178
people who make their own
hummus have too much time

19:06.245 --> 19:07.079
on their hands.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.515
But it's so easy. It's just
chickpeas, and lemon juice-

19:09.581 --> 19:10.516
I know how to make hummus Abby,

19:10.582 --> 19:11.583
just because I don't
make hummus doesn't mean

19:12.000 --> 19:12.484
I don't know how to make it.

19:12.551 --> 19:13.452
How then?

19:13.652 --> 19:16.822
Chickpeas, lemon juice,
olive oil, garlic, tahini.

19:16.889 --> 19:17.689
And salt.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.494
Lola, can you shut
the door please?

19:22.561 --> 19:23.962
There's a draught
coming through.

19:24.029 --> 19:24.796
A giraffe?

19:24.863 --> 19:25.664
No, a draught.

19:25.731 --> 19:26.765
Oh, phew.

19:26.832 --> 19:27.633
Okay.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.135
Oh damn.

19:31.069 --> 19:31.803
Is it working?

19:31.870 --> 19:33.071
No.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.708
Well, you're not an electrician
Mum, Dad is an electrician.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.544
No, but remember,

19:38.610 --> 19:40.646
-You know everything.
-I know everything.

19:40.712 --> 19:41.847
Exactly!

19:42.000 --> 19:43.181
And I'm

19:43.248 --> 19:44.550
amazing.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.419

20:00.232 --> 20:01.300
Great.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.101
[Jake] Thanks, darling.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.469
Thanks for coming over.

20:06.000 --> 20:06.738
It's a good job
safety Matt gave us

20:06.805 --> 20:08.607
that fire extinguisher
last year.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.542
He got me one for my
new place as well.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.311
And some of that
off milk yogurt stuff.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.412
-Mhmm.
-Yeah.

20:14.780 --> 20:15.814
Yeah, I got it working,
and then-

20:15.881 --> 20:16.915
But then it blew up.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.084
I probably should have
finished wiring it

20:19.151 --> 20:20.352
before I dropped it off.

20:22.354 --> 20:23.121
Okay.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.990
Wait, what's that?

20:25.057 --> 20:26.425

yourself out darling.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.910

Stop wasting water.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.645
Oh, is it stuck?

20:48.000 --> 20:48.380
No it's supposed to.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.415
That's what we want it to say.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.388
So you can drop them back
tomorrow after the party, yeah?

20:56.455 --> 20:57.556
Yeah, yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.359
There was something
I wanted to tell you.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.760
I'm seeing someone.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.963
Yeah, Nancy. I'm aware.

21:06.000 --> 21:06.498
Sorry. I won't take
the kids around there

21:06.565 --> 21:07.366
if you don't want me to.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.668
If you want to introduce them
to someone, that's your
decision.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.803
Just don't take them
somewhere overnight

21:12.000 --> 21:13.872
without telling me first, okay?

21:13.939 --> 21:14.740
Right.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.508
And the hair thing.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.609
That's just a bit weird.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.510
Yeah.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.981
And I take it you're
seeing lots of someones?

21:24.000 --> 21:24.650
Mhmm.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.351
No one that needs
introducing.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.253
Okay.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.588
Do you want me to
reset your apple ID?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.324
Nah, sweet as,
Nancy has done it.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.295
-[Nancy] Oh hi.
-[Jake] Nancy, Lauren.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.430
Lauren, Nancy.

21:38.497 --> 21:39.297
Hello.

21:39.498 --> 21:40.966
I didn't realise you
were here all this time.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.402
Oh no, it's fine. I was
just sorting Jake's apps.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.371
Oh, well, next time you must
come in and have a cup of tea.

21:46.438 --> 21:47.539
Aww.

21:48.407 --> 21:49.341
Hey, I was going to say,

21:49.408 --> 21:52.010
you might want to check
your Snap settings.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.347
It's just, it's really easy to
accidentally share something.

21:55.414 --> 21:56.548
I didn't realise Jake had Snap.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.017
Yeah, that was
obviously a mistake.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.553
Yeah, no, I definitely
didn't deliberately send him-

22:06.000 --> 22:06.191
I just wouldn't want the girls
to see your Mrs. Robinson.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.995
Well, my girls see my
Mrs. Robinson quite a lot,

22:10.062 --> 22:10.829
but no, I get your point.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.030
Yeah just online, sort of.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.965
Yeah, but they themselves
are not online,

22:14.032 --> 22:14.933
but I get your point.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.069
Thank you so much.
Nice to meet you.

-Bye bye.

-Bye Mum.
