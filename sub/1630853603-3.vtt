(sighs)

01:09.750 --> 01:12.254
A lot of my life,

01:12.287 --> 01:14.325
I thought I was just a victim.

01:16.229 --> 01:17.899
And because my husband
drank so much,

01:17.932 --> 01:20.738
this would happen
or that would happen.

was always so awful.

I thought if I just could
throw out his liquor,

01:29.623 --> 01:32.394
you know, hide whatever
he was on, that would fix it.

01:34.733 --> 01:37.137

that kind of chaos

01:48.728 --> 01:50.230
And it's difficult.

01:51.533 --> 01:54.706
I know I played a part
in his abuse.

01:57.512 --> 01:59.749
And I'm really mad
at myself for that.

if there's anything
good that came out of it,

it's that it made me realize
that the best thing for me to do

02:13.343 --> 02:15.781
is just to try to keep
my side of the street clean.

06:09.481 --> 06:11.654

06:17.598 --> 06:19.803
But, not too squishy.

06:19.836 --> 06:21.840
No one could do it.
It was always too soft,

06:21.873 --> 06:23.644
or it was too hard,

06:23.677 --> 06:25.614
or it would melt too quickly,
or it was too gummy.

It's defining roles, right?

07:45.273 --> 07:47.712
It's creating
a better workflow.
You're used to that.

07:47.745 --> 07:50.250

-It's a start.

07:50.283 --> 07:52.087
Uh, it's, uh,
it's a mistake.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.524
-It'll help.
-It'll create a toxic,

07:53.557 --> 07:56.061

07:58.099 --> 07:59.970

08:00.003 --> 08:03.042

be a chain of command.

care of their own station.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.829

of the street clean.

Thank you, guys.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.897
Okay. So, um,
as you may have heard,

10:26.930 --> 10:29.703
we are implementing a...

10:29.736 --> 10:31.305
a F-French brigade.

10:31.338 --> 10:34.044
We all heard that.
Right. So, uh,

10:34.077 --> 10:37.184
Carmy is the head chef guy.
He's the chef de cuisine

10:37.217 --> 10:40.123
or the CDC.
Uh, I would be--

10:40.156 --> 10:42.160
I am. I am the--
I am the sous--

10:42.193 --> 10:44.866

-SYDNEY: More just
like a regular...

10:44.899 --> 10:47.404
chill-archy? Uh,

10:47.437 --> 10:49.275
it's more about dividing labor.

10:49.308 --> 10:51.245
So, like, because
I'm the sous, right?

10:51.278 --> 10:53.016
Like, I just, uh, follow orders,

10:53.049 --> 10:56.389
even if it leads to tension
and, uh, chaos and resentment

10:56.422 --> 10:58.994
and ultimately doesn't work.
But yeah, that's what I do.

10:59.027 --> 11:00.698
Sorry (laughs).
I'm the sous.

11:00.731 --> 11:03.202
-Um, Tina, you are--
-No inglés.

11:03.235 --> 11:05.373
Great. I know you speak English.
I've heard you speak it.

How's our brigade?

23:00.770 --> 23:02.406
It's a mess.

23:11.926 --> 23:14.430
-What's going on with you?
-Nothing.

23:17.003 --> 23:18.606
Sydney...

23:19.942 --> 23:21.077
Um...

23:22.881 --> 23:24.184
Yeah. Today was...

23:24.217 --> 23:25.654
(sighs)

23:25.687 --> 23:27.757
really bad for me, Chef.

23:29.060 --> 23:30.162
Okay.

23:33.669 --> 23:35.473
Is there more?

23:35.507 --> 23:37.644
SYDNEY:
I don't know. Um...

23:39.848 --> 23:42.654
Chef, you... you kinda let

23:42.687 --> 23:45.459
everybody act like trash, and...

23:46.796 --> 23:50.604
really kind of came
at me a little, I guess.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.610
-Uh--
-I expect more from you.

23:53.643 --> 23:56.181
-Hm.
-Hold you to a higher standard.

23:56.214 --> 23:57.751
Paying my dues?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.924
Doing your job.

24:00.957 --> 24:04.030
Which is to, at times,
listen to your boss.

24:09.708 --> 24:12.046
You know, I think

24:12.079 --> 24:14.952
this place could be so different

24:14.985 --> 24:17.156
from all the other places
we've been at.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.532
But, in order for
that to be true,

24:21.565 --> 24:23.936
we need to run things different.

24:25.573 --> 24:27.544
When I said I didn't think

24:27.577 --> 24:29.515
that the brigade
was a good idea,

24:29.548 --> 24:32.186
you didn't listen.
And it's not that

24:32.219 --> 24:34.692
you told me that I had to.

24:34.725 --> 24:37.497
That's fine.
Whatever. But...

24:38.833 --> 24:42.172
But you just didn't
really listen, and...

24:44.711 --> 24:45.981
if this is going to work the way

24:46.014 --> 24:49.855
that I think we both
want it to work,

24:49.888 --> 24:52.160
I-I mean, I think

24:52.193 --> 24:53.930
we should probably...

24:53.963 --> 24:58.238
try to listen to each other.

24:58.271 --> 25:00.677
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.848
-You're right.
-The reason I'm here

25:02.881 --> 25:06.088
and not working
somewhere else,

25:06.121 --> 25:08.158
or for someone else,

25:08.191 --> 25:10.229
is 'cause...

25:10.262 --> 25:13.903
I think I can stand out here.
I can make a difference here.

25:13.936 --> 25:15.306
We could share ideas.

25:15.339 --> 25:19.582
I could implement things
that make this place...

25:19.615 --> 25:22.988
better, and I don't wanna
be wasting my time,

25:23.021 --> 25:25.126
working on another line

25:25.159 --> 25:27.263
or tweezing herbs on a dish

25:27.296 --> 25:29.167
that I don't care about,

25:29.200 --> 25:31.606
or-or-or running brunch,
God forbid.

25:31.639 --> 25:32.707
(laughs) Yeah.

25:34.611 --> 25:37.283
And then, you know,

25:37.316 --> 25:39.989
you kinda left.
Like, you...

25:40.022 --> 25:43.897
Y-y-you did. Not even "kinda."
You just straight-up left.

25:43.930 --> 25:46.903
-Yeah.
-And that's not really cool.

25:46.936 --> 25:49.274
-You know, after dumping
all this stuff on me.
-No. No, it's not.

25:49.307 --> 25:52.312
I know. I know that. Um...

25:58.759 --> 26:00.029
I went to an Al-Anon meeting.

26:00.062 --> 26:02.567
My brother, uh,
he was an addict.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.692
-Chef, that is...
-(sighs)

26:14.725 --> 26:16.762
a little too personal, I think.

26:19.367 --> 26:20.770
Oh. I'm...

26:20.803 --> 26:22.641
Sorry.

26:22.674 --> 26:25.647
I was just fucking with you.
I-I'm sorry.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.849
-I'm so sorry.
-(laughs)

26:26.882 --> 26:29.187
(laughing)

26:29.220 --> 26:30.957
It's alright.

26:33.996 --> 26:35.232
Just...

26:35.265 --> 26:38.304
-feel like I'm owed one.
-Sure.

26:39.942 --> 26:42.614
It's not an excuse.
You know, I know.

26:43.816 --> 26:45.820
-I know that.
-Mm.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.328
But now I know
that you know, so...

26:51.030 --> 26:52.901
Good.

26:55.773 --> 26:57.009
Fuckin' brunch.

26:57.042 --> 27:01.151
-Fuck brunch.
-Fuck brunch.

27:01.184 --> 27:04.390
-I'm gonna get rocked tonight.
-Oh, absolutely fucking
destroyed. Yeah.
