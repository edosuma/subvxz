WEBVTT

00:32.323 --> 00:35.827
You know, you are so lucky to go to prom.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.746
I never got to go to mine.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.164
Yeah, uh-huh. I don't know

00:39.247 --> 00:41.207
if I should get a blowout or an updo.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.504
I missed my prom because I had
to testify against my momma.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.467
Everyone got the most romantic
night of their life,

00:50.550 --> 00:53.178
and all I got was my momma sent to jail.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.138
I think I'll get an updo.

00:55.221 --> 00:59.434
The bailiff that had
to wrestle my mamma had an updo.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.562
You're gonna look so pretty.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.029
I put some syrup in your soda

01:11.112 --> 01:13.364
because I know you like stuff sweet.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.657
How many spoons?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.534
I don't know. I just poured.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.039
Bobby, you poured good.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.708
Why don't you treat yourself to one?

01:23.792 --> 01:26.086
You sure know how to live, Lucky.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.839

I had such a stressful day.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.884
I can't wait till prom
season is over on Saturday.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.845
Then you and me and teenie Lucky

01:35.929 --> 01:37.972
can go out on a romantic date.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.766
You know, I would love to,

01:39.849 --> 01:42.060
but right now I'm rigging
my truck for stumping.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.520
What's "stumping"?

01:43.645 --> 01:46.314
It's when you go hunting
for a stump of burled walnut,

01:46.397 --> 01:48.858
the most valuable of all the trophy woods,

01:48.942 --> 01:50.276
and pull it out of the ground.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.569
I'll come with you.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.530
I could brew some sun tea

01:53.613 --> 01:55.406
and bring a picnic basket.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.534
The ants will get into our food

01:57.617 --> 01:59.452
and then we'll laugh and laugh.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.413
I'm sorry, but stumping
is a gentleman's pursuit.

02:02.497 --> 02:06.000
So is sticking and catfisting
and everything you do.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.921
Luanne, my life would be easier
without this passion,

02:10.004 --> 02:11.714
but it wouldn't be as full.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.392
Uh, Peggy, my steak seems kind of small.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.811
You're not pulling the new
guidelines on me, are you?

02:24.894 --> 02:26.020
No, I am not.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.149
I just didn't realize that
Luanne would be with us tonight,

02:29.232 --> 02:31.442
so I had to re-portion.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.862
I thought I was going out with Lucky,

02:33.945 --> 02:37.615
but he doesn't have the time
to spend with me.

02:39.659 --> 02:43.121
Huh. So I guess
you had nowhere else to go?

02:43.204 --> 02:45.290
Hank.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.084
What's she want? A piece off my plate?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.669
There's not a whole lot there.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.302
Yep. Yep.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.303
Mm-hmm.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.180
I've had it since I was 12,

03:00.263 --> 03:03.224
a constant, high-pitched
ringing in my left ear.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.227
I guess it's something
I'll just have to learn to live with.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.983
Luanne's not home, Lucky.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.443
We're not here to see Luanne.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.612
We came to visit you, Uncle Hank.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.281
See, I'm looking to get
more power into my winch.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.991
Hmm, continue.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.952
You see, winches ain't
something the three of us know.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.787
What I know about dogs.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.539
You need something done about a dog,

03:26.623 --> 03:27.999
I'm the one you see.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.752
Lucky, your man's making me nervous.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.587
Mud Dauber didn't mean to scare you.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.048
-Did you, Mud Dauber?
-Not at present.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.634
He's just upset
'cause he and Elvin can't help me

03:37.717 --> 03:41.012
bring in a 48 inch stump of burled walnut.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.639
It's not we don't want to.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.767
It's all 'cause judge says
we can't cross the county line.

03:45.850 --> 03:50.021
Boy, I've never heard
of a 48 inch stump of burled walnut.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.689
You're talking diameter, right?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.483
He don't talk nothing else.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.859
It's real, all right.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.404
My grandpappy first found it back in 1923.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.951
<i>Grandpappy was</i><i>on a church picnic,</i>

04:03.034 --> 04:05.203
<i>and got separated</i><i>from his group.</i>

04:05.954 --> 04:08.748
<i>A storm came up over the hills,</i>

04:08.831 --> 04:13.586
<i>and Grandpappy</i><i>had to take shelter
in what</i><i>turned out to be the most</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:17.006
<i>valuable stump in all of Texas.</i>

04:18.007 --> 04:19.509
<i>As fate would have it,</i>

04:19.592 --> 04:22.178
<i>Grandpappy took ill</i>
<i>and was called to his maker</i>

04:22.262 --> 04:24.222
<i>before he had a chance</i><i>to bring it in.</i>

04:25.265 --> 04:28.476
<i>I hunted that piece of walnut</i>
<i>for many a year.</i>

04:28.559 --> 04:31.688
<i>And then one day,</i><i>I finally found it.</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:34.357
<i>Set my winch to it</i><i>and everything.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:36.109
<i>But the cable snapped.</i>

04:36.901 --> 04:39.320
<i>I went to the Costco</i><i>to buy a new one,</i>

04:39.404 --> 04:41.489
<i>slipped on pee pee,</i>
<i>got my settlement moneys,</i>

04:41.572 --> 04:43.283
and the rest is history.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.577
That stump was worth $15,000,

04:46.661 --> 04:48.413
and that's in back then dollars.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.833
And due to Elvin and Mud
Dauber's... indiscretions,

04:51.916 --> 04:54.252
I am down fellow adventurers.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.422
I've always wanted to
see walnut in the wild.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.633
And Boomhauer's always wanted
a walnut dashboard.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.137
Yeah, and my rifle could use
a burled walnut stock.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.056
And I need a walnut... hat!

05:07.140 --> 05:09.809
And I... Oh, I just wanna come.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.983
You know, in the old days,
that stuff would be crawling with nits.

05:21.029 --> 05:25.491
Don't worry, little boy. I'm going to give
you the best cut ever!

05:26.326 --> 05:28.745
Because prom pictures are forever.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.539
As are not prom pictures,

05:31.622 --> 05:33.958
which are all I have.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.169
I'm not going to the prom. I can't.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.670
Of course you can.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.006
Everyone goes to the prom now,

05:40.089 --> 05:42.091
even the crippled and the gay.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.343
I don't have a date.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.512
Really? I'd go with you in a heartbeat.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.519
Well... would you like to go
with me to the prom?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.813
Me? Oh.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.482
You are such a sweet boy.

05:57.565 --> 06:01.235
I would love to,
but I already have a fiancÃ©.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.155
-Oh.
-Hey, I've got nothing going on that night

06:04.238 --> 06:05.531
if you wanna grab a taco.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.452
I'm not saying stumping isn't risky.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.454
When you're out there
with nothing but chains,

06:11.537 --> 06:14.040
beer and a winch,
you could rip your arm off,

06:14.123 --> 06:16.334
and there ain't no one out there to sue.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.173
Hey, Baby Girl, and my girl's baby.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.591
Look at my new winch.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.176
That's nice.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.095
Hey Lucky,

06:27.178 --> 06:31.140
the inspectors are letting That's Amore
open back up tomorrow night.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.560
Well, bring me home some osso bucco then,

06:34.644 --> 06:36.521
'cause me and the boys are going out.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.110
Fine, then I, too, will be going out
with a boy as well.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.071
To the Arlen High School Prom.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.864
I have been asked.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.620
No way, Luanne.

06:52.703 --> 06:56.082
You will not wear
another man's wrist corsage.

06:56.165 --> 06:59.001
If you are not going to take me
out on a Saturday night,

06:59.085 --> 07:01.087
or ever, why shouldn't I go?

07:01.170 --> 07:04.924
Because I've seen the movies,
and I know what goes on at prom.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.342
You're sitting this one out.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.802
Nu-uh, I'm not!

07:07.927 --> 07:10.805
Prom night is the most
romantic night of the year,

07:10.888 --> 07:13.683
and I am not spending it alone again.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.727
Luanne, I'm not messing around here.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.479
If you go to that prom...

07:18.563 --> 07:19.897
Well, that does it!

07:19.981 --> 07:22.608
Well, if you go stumping, then...

07:22.692 --> 07:24.444
then that does it!

07:24.527 --> 07:25.611
Oh, no!

07:26.195 --> 07:27.280
Don't do this, you guys!

07:27.363 --> 07:31.826
Lay down your pride and give way
to the glory of love!

07:35.329 --> 07:36.664
I'm going stumpin'.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.425
Well, I guess that does it.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.433
I cannot believe

07:55.516 --> 07:58.603
someone in this family is
finally going to their prom.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.314
I could have gone
with an ugly or unpopular guy,

08:01.397 --> 08:03.357
but I stuck by my principles.

08:03.441 --> 08:07.904
Sometimes I wish my leg was a stump
so Lucky would pay attention to me.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.864
-Is that wrong?
-Yes.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.742
You should not be fantasizing
about being a hunk of wood.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.953
You should be thinking
about this magical night ahead.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.665
The gymnasium will be transformed
with glitter and crepe paper.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.335
There might even be balloons
in the basketball hoops.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.879
I never dreamed that going to a dance

08:24.962 --> 08:28.466
with a 15-year-old boy
I barely know could be so wonderful!

08:28.549 --> 08:29.425
Oh!

08:29.550 --> 08:33.679
Oh, Luanne, tomorrow night,
I will be living vicariously through you.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.139
Thank you!

08:35.264 --> 08:37.475
Okay, when you dance,
I want you to do it in a way

08:37.558 --> 08:40.478
that will make people form
a circle around you and clap.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.359
So, what'll it be... the Linda Evans

08:46.442 --> 08:48.778
or the Joan Collins?

08:53.241 --> 08:55.910
Come on, Bobby! Keep brushing!

08:55.993 --> 08:57.620
You've got to flatten this thing out!

08:57.703 --> 09:01.207
I'm trying, but it keeps on jumping back!

09:02.458 --> 09:03.543
Who is it?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.378
I'm kind of having a tux emergency.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.964
It's Kevin! You can't be here!

09:08.047 --> 09:10.341
It's bad luck to see me before the prom!

09:10.424 --> 09:12.927
I think that's
on your wedding day, Luanne.

09:13.010 --> 09:13.886
Oh.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.721
This was all the tux shop had left.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.765
I thought I'd look like James Bond.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.559
I'm not gonna look like James Bond.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.602
Oh, Kevin, don't worry.

09:21.686 --> 09:25.481
What you wear is so much less important
than what I'm wearing.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.735
What's wrong?

09:29.819 --> 09:30.778
Them.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.864
That's just Elvin and Mud Dauber.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.491
Go away! Git!

09:35.575 --> 09:36.617
I'm busy!

09:37.910 --> 09:39.245
Who the hell is he?

09:39.328 --> 09:41.539
This is my friend, Kevin.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.584
Kevin is taking me to the prom.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.170
So you're out going to some damn prom
behind Lucky's back?

09:48.254 --> 09:49.922
-Who's Lucky?
-Shut up.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.882
Aunt Peggy!

09:51.966 --> 09:55.177
Elvin and Mud Dauber are making trouble!

09:55.261 --> 09:56.554
Not in my house.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.764
Not unless you want some of this.

10:02.268 --> 10:06.063
Relax. It's just oven cleaner,
but they don't know that.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.404
We've been off road
for a while now, Lucky.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.363
Do you have a map?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.656
Uh-huh.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.034
Must be an implant.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.036
I wonder who did his.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.997
The guy who did mine
did not inspire confidence.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.875
Lucky here. What?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.335
Ow!

10:27.418 --> 10:29.253
You sure about that?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.215
Well, Luanne's made her decision.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.676
She's going to the prom with that kid.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.345
Uh...

10:37.428 --> 10:41.182
when you're stumpin',
you don't talk about relationships, right?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.642
Nope.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.809
Well, all right.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.896
What did Lucky say?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.481
Oh, he's hurtin'.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.274
I can tell it in his voice.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.443
We got to make this right.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.999
I wonder what sound you'll make.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.461
I'm 15 years old,
and I'm a high school senior.

11:10.544 --> 11:11.754
I've lived through everything.

11:11.879 --> 11:15.424
I've been teased, I've been pantsed,
I've had my head shoved in the toilet.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.843
What can you do to me
that hasn't been done?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.261
Kill you.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.602
Luanne, you look almost lovely.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.104
Almost?

11:28.187 --> 11:31.357
That's why I want you to have this.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.734
A tiara!

11:33.818 --> 11:35.903
It's so beautiful.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.571
Just take good care of it.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.200
It has been in the family
since Halloween of 1973.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.706
Five men,

11:46.789 --> 11:47.957
one stump.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.501
This is the sort of thing
they write books about.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.295
You know what would make
for an even better book?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.215
If one of us turned
into a werewolf right now.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.761
Uh, can't do it.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.305
You okay?

12:03.889 --> 12:04.974
We're getting close.

12:05.057 --> 12:09.353
That was the exact same gopher hole
I tripped in years ago.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.604
Oh!

12:11.188 --> 12:13.733
And that's the same branch
I hit my head on.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.653
I stumbled forward on my hands
and knees for 15...

12:17.737 --> 12:20.072
No, 16 paces until...

12:20.156 --> 12:21.824
Oh!

12:21.907 --> 12:23.033
There it is!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.334
Oh, my God.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.379
That's six burls per square inch.

12:35.463 --> 12:39.133
I've found you, you burled son of a bitch!

12:44.472 --> 12:48.058
It's my prom date! Coming!

12:50.936 --> 12:53.105
This is such a magical night!

12:53.189 --> 12:55.399
I feel just like Cinderella!

12:55.483 --> 12:58.903
Little boy, did you used to be a mouse?

12:58.986 --> 13:00.529
I'm Kevin's brother.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.573
He asked me to bring you this.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.618
Oh, my God!

13:05.701 --> 13:08.078
Kevin isn't taking me to the prom.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.124
I used to have a fiancÃ© who loved me!

13:12.208 --> 13:13.834
Then he left me, and I thought,

13:13.918 --> 13:19.799
"Oh, well, I get to go to the prom.
At least I'll get to be happy one night!"

13:19.882 --> 13:24.678
But now, I'll never be happy ever again!

13:24.762 --> 13:27.890
Why is this happening,
Kevin's little brother?

13:29.391 --> 13:31.060
Do you have any candy?

13:32.686 --> 13:35.231
I have no candy, either!

13:44.907 --> 13:46.784
Go ahead, Bobby, ask her.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.536
Don't make me, please!

13:52.706 --> 13:54.500
Ugh!

13:54.583 --> 13:57.628
Luanne, I know it's not for a few years,

13:57.711 --> 14:01.465
but will you go to my prom with me?

14:05.261 --> 14:08.722
Oh, honey, crying will
not make this go away.

14:08.806 --> 14:09.849
I will.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.309
There's nothing to do, Aunt Peggy.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.396
Lucky's gone, and Kevin's gone.

14:15.980 --> 14:20.109
Maybe I'll just crash the prom,
and everyone will suffer.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.904
Well, I cannot make Lucky a better man.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.739
But I think I can help.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.616
Come on, get your tiara.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.829
Kevin!

14:32.329 --> 14:34.665
You are taking Luanne to the prom.

14:34.748 --> 14:38.377
You have to take me, Kevin!
I traded my fiancÃ© for this!

14:38.460 --> 14:40.129
But those men said they'll kill me.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.339
They'll have to get past me first.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.175
Well, you are pretty scary.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.427
Yes, I am.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.847
Now are you gonna to clip
on this bow tie, or am I?

14:53.767 --> 14:56.854
Okay, guys, looks like
we're a little short on cable.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.274
So all we need is to get a few crowbars
underneath the stump

15:00.357 --> 15:02.401
and leverage up about six inches.

15:02.484 --> 15:05.863
Then Lucky and I will pull
the winch cable taut, lock it on

15:05.946 --> 15:06.822
and pull it out.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.657
-All right, I'm ready, let's go.
-Yeah. Let's go, man.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.783
Yay!

15:10.534 --> 15:12.369
Okay, Lucky, let's do it.

15:12.953 --> 15:16.206
One, two, three... now!

15:19.752 --> 15:21.003
Just another inch or two!

15:24.048 --> 15:25.799
Lucky, put your weight into it!

15:25.883 --> 15:27.593
Oh, man, come on, man.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.719
Lucky!

15:29.303 --> 15:32.097
Have you seen this picture
of Luanne eating pancakes?

15:41.857 --> 15:43.400
What sounds good to eat?

15:43.484 --> 15:44.777
I'm not really hungry.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.280
No, no, no, this is going to be
the best night of my life, damn it!

15:48.364 --> 15:51.075
You will have chicken,
and I will have steak!

15:51.158 --> 15:53.118
Just like I always imagined!

15:56.622 --> 15:59.166
Kevin, you've got nothing to worry about.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.670
Elvin and Mud Dauber are not
going to do anything to you.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.589
Not when they're already
on probation for violent crime.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.632
What did they do?

16:06.715 --> 16:08.676
I don't know. Something with a nail gun.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.639
Oh, there's an old lady selling roses.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.349
We will take one!

16:16.558 --> 16:18.143
Oh, face it,

16:18.227 --> 16:20.521
she was meant for better men than us.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.272
We were so close.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.525
I've never felt closer to anyone.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.276
Talkin' bout ol' giving up, man.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.238
Come on, man, you ain't got
no pain, there ain't no gain, man.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.739
Boomhauer is right.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.784
It took this long to find it,
we're not letting it go.

16:33.867 --> 16:34.827
Yay!

16:34.910 --> 16:37.621
So, Uncle Hank, you think
I should apologize to Luanne

16:37.705 --> 16:40.165
and tell her that I love her
with all my heart,

16:40.249 --> 16:43.168
and if I can't do something with her,
it's not worth doing at all?

16:44.628 --> 16:46.672
Don't take this the wrong way, Lucky,

16:46.755 --> 16:50.092
but I sincerely don't care what you do.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.301
I got ya.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.762
Okay, let's do it!

17:02.604 --> 17:03.564
Huh.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.535
Everything looks so beautiful.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.080
Would you start having a good time?

17:20.164 --> 17:23.208
This night is going to make up
for how crappy my life is.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.335
Let's dance.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.503
I don't know.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.255
Come on, it's easy.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.840
I put my head here,

17:29.923 --> 17:31.925
and you put your hand right here,

17:32.009 --> 17:35.679
and maybe if you're lucky,
you'll feel the baby kick.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.609
<i>âª Give you everything, every part of me âª</i>

17:51.153 --> 17:52.112
Okay, go ahead.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.155
Not so fast.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.284
Okay, next.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.997
-Elvin?
-What?

18:02.081 --> 18:05.459
Have you ever been bit
by a brown recluse spider?

18:05.542 --> 18:07.836
If I had, I'd be dead,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.839
and you wouldn't be asking me
about it now, would you?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.883
Shh. I see 'em.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.676
Touch dancing.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.557
Did you hear something?

18:20.641 --> 18:23.644
Kevin, we're fine. It's completely safe.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.565
Aunt Peggy, help!

18:29.566 --> 18:31.068
Coming!

18:47.793 --> 18:51.380
Kevin, you are going to have to fight.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.422
I can't.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.049
I know you think you can't.

18:54.133 --> 18:58.428
But when pushed too far,
you nerds always have amazing strength.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.598
You can punch the bully out
with one punch.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.397
I can't get a grip.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.232
He's wriggling like a frog.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.067
Then whomp him like one.

19:14.903 --> 19:18.282
Kevin, summon your amazing strength.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.330
There a problem here, boys?

19:25.414 --> 19:27.207
Nothing can't be fixed.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.175
Let the boy go, Elvin.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.437
Did you get your stump?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.607
I did a lot of thinking out
in those woods, Luanne.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.400
And I came to realize...

19:53.817 --> 19:55.485
that you are my stump.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.947
Oh, Lucky.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.240
I missed you.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.328
I'm gonna go now.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.789
Not so fast, boy.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.499
My girl wants to have a prom,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.418
and I'm not dressed for one myself,

20:11.501 --> 20:13.754
so go ahead and be her date.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.173
But the last dance is mine.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.718
And tell the D.J. the last song

20:19.801 --> 20:23.931
is gonna be <i>25 Or 6 To 4</i>
by the great Chicago.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.058
Oh!

20:30.270 --> 20:32.231
I'm so cold.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.691
We're all cold, Dale.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.985
If we huddle together,

20:37.069 --> 20:40.530
we'll retain our heat,
and we won't get hypothermia.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.907
Not a chance.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.576
Come on, Hank. No one will ever know.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.370
I will. And that's enough.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.685
<i>Summon your amazing strength.</i>
