Tyrone.
What blend is that bag?

02:10.854 --> 02:12.955
Winter. Oh, shit.

02:12.957 --> 02:14.957
Sorry, Shane.

02:14.959 --> 02:18.127
Please,
pay better attention.

02:18.129 --> 02:21.196
It's just we never had
a mid-winter blend before,

02:21.198 --> 02:23.665
and it's, like, why
and who cares?

02:23.667 --> 02:26.036
I can't think about that,
Tyrone, and neither should you.

02:28.939 --> 02:32.740
- Good morning, Lulu.
- Good morning, Carl.

02:32.742 --> 02:35.211
Hey, Lulu.
Check this out.

02:44.654 --> 02:46.521
Are you break-dancing,
Carl?

02:46.523 --> 02:49.257
Yes. It's... body popping.

02:49.259 --> 02:51.893
Ice! No dancing!

02:51.895 --> 02:53.663
Get back to work.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.473
Excuse me.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.076
Excuse me?

03:09.879 --> 03:11.848
May I have
a large cappuccino, please?

03:22.624 --> 03:25.560
Here you go, sir.
One large cappuccino.

03:25.562 --> 03:27.862
Thank you.
Is Mr. Danger here?

03:27.864 --> 03:29.866
Yeah, hang on a second.

03:38.308 --> 03:42.043
Hi. Shane Danger, Manager.

03:42.045 --> 03:44.345
Mr. Danger,
I'm Barry Ofeld

03:44.347 --> 03:46.682
with Human Resources
from our corporate office.

03:48.052 --> 03:50.720
Is there somewhere
we can speak in private?

03:56.092 --> 04:01.062
The reason for my visit is the company is
in the process of scaling back operations.

04:01.064 --> 04:04.300
This means making across-the-board
personnel cuts, Mr. Danger.

04:05.935 --> 04:06.968
Oh.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.602
Unfortunately,
we must ask you

04:08.604 --> 04:12.241
to relieve one of your employees
of their responsibilities.

04:12.243 --> 04:14.042
I will leave that
to your discretion,

04:14.044 --> 04:16.810
but we'd like this to happen
immediately, Mr. Danger.

04:16.813 --> 04:20.314
- Do you have any questions?
- No, I don't think so.

04:20.315 --> 04:24.154
Times are tough, Mr. Danger.
Better one of them than you.

04:25.055 --> 04:26.890
Good point.

04:32.895 --> 04:35.198
Not a very good cappuccino.

04:36.733 --> 04:38.635
If you'll excuse me.

04:43.973 --> 04:47.075
That guy was
checking you out, Lulu.

04:47.077 --> 04:50.011
No, I was
checking him out, Carl.

04:56.952 --> 04:58.921
It wasn't that funny,
Carl.

05:01.091 --> 05:04.859
Lulu, if you could
see me in my office.

05:04.861 --> 05:06.196
Certainly.

05:20.676 --> 05:24.446
I'm sorry. There was nothing
I could do about it.

05:24.448 --> 05:27.248
You can stop
going on about it.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.852
I don't care
about the job.

05:34.457 --> 05:37.191
Oh. Someone told me today
what they were building

05:37.193 --> 05:38.794
behind
the hardware center.

05:40.796 --> 05:43.964
Oh, but I can't remember
what it was.

05:56.846 --> 05:59.913
Oh, I remember now.

05:59.915 --> 06:03.919
They're putting in a state-of-the-art
fitness center behind the hardware center.

06:05.355 --> 06:07.823
Might have to get
my gym bag on.

06:14.397 --> 06:17.098
Thanks, sweetie.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.767
Now I have to find my way
to bed in the dark.

06:30.212 --> 06:31.747
Sweetie.

06:34.316 --> 06:36.484
Five dollars for fun.

06:36.486 --> 06:39.353
Why don't you enjoy yourself and buy
one of those cinnamon swirly things

06:39.355 --> 06:41.224
you like so much
from the bakeshop?

06:44.093 --> 06:47.163
I will see you later,
won't I, sweetie?

07:00.410 --> 07:03.844
Kinda does feel like
a morgue with Lulu gone.

07:03.846 --> 07:07.781
- She was fun.
- Yeah, well, she got fired, Carl.

07:07.783 --> 07:10.117
Times are tough.
We have jobs to do.

07:10.119 --> 07:12.852
And this is what happens
when you don't do your job.

07:12.854 --> 07:15.423
So, we have
our first casualty, guys.

07:15.425 --> 07:18.060
Might not be our last.

07:26.402 --> 07:29.537
You gonna have problems with your
marriage now you fired your wife, Shane?

07:29.539 --> 07:34.074
No, I am not gonna have
problems with my marriage now, Tyrone.

07:34.076 --> 07:36.109
I have
a tremendous marriage.

07:36.111 --> 07:38.512
In fact, Lulu is relieved
not to be working.

07:38.514 --> 07:40.814
Well, I got problems,
Shane.

07:40.816 --> 07:43.250
My mom just got diabetes.

07:43.252 --> 07:47.053
I have to buy her a little scooter to get
her around, but I don't have no money.

07:47.055 --> 07:50.824
I'm sorry about that,
but you have to save, Tyrone.

07:50.826 --> 07:53.127
I save everything I can,

07:53.129 --> 07:56.266
and I think positive
all the time!

07:58.501 --> 08:00.601
Okay,
I have to take a shit.

08:00.603 --> 08:02.936
Can you guys man the shop
for 25 minutes?

08:02.938 --> 08:04.273
Sure.

08:09.344 --> 08:12.446
Who shits for 25 minutes?

08:12.448 --> 08:16.850
<i>Love me, love me, love me.</i>

08:16.852 --> 08:19.387
Hey, nearly birthday girl.

08:19.389 --> 08:21.988
Can I make you
a cappuccino?

08:21.990 --> 08:24.157
Oh, I used to
make cappuccinos.

08:24.159 --> 08:26.993
Sweetie,
Mr. Ofeld said,

08:26.995 --> 08:31.131
"Either the both of you go,
or just the girl.

08:31.133 --> 08:33.133
The girl's gonna
go anyway though."

08:33.135 --> 08:36.039
So I chose to stay, so at
least one of us has a job.

08:37.905 --> 08:40.106
You seem sad.

08:40.107 --> 08:44.578
Yeah, well, this TV
is really shitty, you know?

08:44.580 --> 08:46.647
That's what I want
for my birthday...

08:46.649 --> 08:49.082
a new, bigger, better TV.

08:49.084 --> 08:52.419
So I can sit in front of it all day
until my ass gets so fat and flat

08:52.421 --> 08:54.289
we have to get a new couch.

08:55.524 --> 08:58.957
Don't say that.

08:58.959 --> 09:01.162
Plus, we don't have that
kind of money right now.

09:01.164 --> 09:03.364
Not until
I become area manager,

09:03.366 --> 09:05.901
which, I think,
is gonna happen, by the way.

09:10.505 --> 09:12.040
Now that's
a real cappuccino.

09:14.242 --> 09:17.577
Maybe I should ask my brother
for a new TV.

09:17.579 --> 09:20.313
He's got that kind of money
in his cashbox.

09:20.315 --> 09:22.449
Who? Adjay?

09:22.451 --> 09:23.952
Yeah, right.

09:29.625 --> 09:32.158
How much money does Adjay
have in his cashbox?

09:32.160 --> 09:34.596
More than what you have
in your tiny little cashbox.

09:35.931 --> 09:38.467
I don't have
a fucking cashbox.

09:41.636 --> 09:45.938
There's no way that little fuckin'
vegan has more money than me.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.943
No, he does.

09:52.615 --> 09:54.584
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in the bath.

09:58.186 --> 10:03.058
<i>Oh, yes. I am the fresh
fun, goodie goodie man.</i>

10:05.160 --> 10:10.263
An... Evening...
with Beverly Luff Linn.

10:10.265 --> 10:15.001
<i>For one magical night only.</i>

10:15.003 --> 10:17.671
<i>Beverly.
Beverly Luff Linn.</i>

10:17.673 --> 10:20.442
<i>Luff Linn. Luff Linn.</i>

10:27.282 --> 10:29.382
Is that you, sweetie?

10:29.384 --> 10:30.918
Yes.

10:33.220 --> 10:37.660
Sweetie, exactly how much money
is in Adjay's cashbox?

10:40.195 --> 10:42.664
A lot.

10:48.737 --> 10:52.674
Sweetie, I don't understand how Adjay
has got all this fucking money.

10:53.642 --> 10:55.040
He saves.

10:55.042 --> 10:57.176
So do fucking I!

10:57.178 --> 10:59.414
Well, Adjay saves more
than fucking you.

11:11.593 --> 11:15.195
Okay, do we all know what we're doing?
I'm staying in the car.

11:15.197 --> 11:18.765
I'm walking in with you, Shane, and asking a
guy to take me to the grains of paradise.

11:18.767 --> 11:21.601
And he will take you to the back
of the store to the spice aisle.

11:21.603 --> 11:23.403
Yes, he will.

11:23.405 --> 11:26.676
You will keep him there as
long as possible. Yes, I will.

11:28.610 --> 11:30.145
Let's do this.

11:42.791 --> 11:44.491
How may I help
you gentlemen?

11:44.493 --> 11:46.759
Take me to the grains
of paradise.

11:46.761 --> 11:49.662
Wow, your face
is very shiny, man.

11:49.664 --> 11:51.533
Yeah, my family
has thyroid.

11:53.101 --> 11:55.235
I will take you
to the grains of paradise.

11:55.237 --> 11:56.605
Come.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.280
This is
the highest grade.

12:08.282 --> 12:11.353
This is the best
grains of paradise, okay? Yes?

12:13.588 --> 12:15.457
You don't look well,
man.

12:16.725 --> 12:18.525
Where's your friend,
by the way?

12:18.527 --> 12:21.227
Oh, he's just at the front of the
store looking for a couple of items.

12:21.229 --> 12:24.229
How many kinds
are there?

12:24.231 --> 12:26.668
This is the cheaper. This is the
cheaper grains of paradise?

12:29.471 --> 12:32.538
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

12:35.175 --> 12:37.310
Are you trying
to rob me, man?

12:37.312 --> 12:40.113
What the fuck is going on?

12:40.115 --> 12:42.782
Shane? Is that you?

12:42.784 --> 12:45.685
Adjay!
What the fuck, Shane?

12:45.687 --> 12:47.754
Are you seriously
trying to rob me?

12:47.756 --> 12:50.289
No! Are you fucking crazy?

12:50.291 --> 12:54.128
Okay! Now!
Tyrone, run! Go!

13:02.537 --> 13:04.337
Carl, drive!

13:30.532 --> 13:31.866
Miss?

13:34.436 --> 13:37.436
Cinnamon swirly!
Cinnamon swirly!

13:37.438 --> 13:39.739
Little swirls of cinnamon.

13:39.741 --> 13:42.842
Yum, yum, yum.

13:42.844 --> 13:44.445
Cinnamon, cinnamon.

13:50.452 --> 13:52.354
Cinnamon bullshit.

13:56.558 --> 13:59.759
Who is this
fucking Shane Danger?

13:59.761 --> 14:02.795
He's my fucking
brother-in-law.

14:02.797 --> 14:06.531
He shot a fuckin' hole
in your ceiling.

14:06.533 --> 14:11.437
Yes, and then he ran off with my fucking
cashbox with my fucking savings.

14:11.439 --> 14:13.141
You think!

14:14.843 --> 14:16.743
Fucking Shane Danger!

14:16.745 --> 14:21.482
That's not even a fucking real name!
Stupid fucking fucks!

14:24.919 --> 14:28.720
So, this Shane Danger. He's
got some new monies, huh?

14:28.722 --> 14:30.622
Yes.

14:30.624 --> 14:32.758
I'm just rolling
through town,

14:32.760 --> 14:35.561
and then I hear you want the monies
back from this Shane Danger.

14:35.563 --> 14:37.997
- I can help you do that.
- Really?

14:37.999 --> 14:40.332
I was going to talk
to my cousin Poony.

14:40.334 --> 14:42.535
Forget cousin Poony.

14:42.537 --> 14:44.438
This is what I do.

14:46.373 --> 14:48.440
Tell me more.

14:48.442 --> 14:50.609
You give me
Shane Danger's address.

14:50.611 --> 14:54.346
I bring you the cashbox.
You give me $200.

14:54.348 --> 14:57.382
You must blow out
his kneecap.

14:57.384 --> 15:00.522
Yeah. I promise you I'll
blow out both his kneecaps.

15:01.823 --> 15:05.692
Valerie! We need a pen
and a fucking paper!

15:05.694 --> 15:09.628
I need to write Shane Danger's
address down for this man.

16:01.749 --> 16:05.684
Okay. Time to open
the glove box, Colin.

16:05.686 --> 16:07.020
Yeah.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.766
Cashbox.

16:20.768 --> 16:21.902
Kneecaps.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.318
Are you the party man,
party man?

17:16.656 --> 17:18.454
Oh, hey, sweetie.

17:18.457 --> 17:20.592
You gonna let
the party man in, Shane?

17:20.594 --> 17:22.528
Sure. Who is he?

17:23.497 --> 17:25.696
I'm Colin.
Colin.

17:25.699 --> 17:27.534
Coming in
for a drink, Colin?

17:28.902 --> 17:30.404
Yes, I am.

17:47.155 --> 17:49.754
Why do you always
make that brown shit?

17:49.756 --> 17:51.725
Because
it's a fan favorite.

17:52.893 --> 17:55.362
Do you think Colin
will like it?

18:13.480 --> 18:15.449
Kinda looks
like a shit shake.

18:18.085 --> 18:20.020
So how do you guys
know Colin?

18:22.155 --> 18:24.789
- I thought you knew this guy.
- I don't know him.

18:24.791 --> 18:26.758
You told me to invite
him in for a drink.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.161
You don't have to do
what I say.

18:31.765 --> 18:33.399
Who the fuck is this guy?

18:38.972 --> 18:41.172
Colin?

18:41.174 --> 18:42.576
Who the fuck are you?

18:45.045 --> 18:46.578
You stole the cashbox
from Adjay!

18:46.580 --> 18:48.513
Now Adjay wants
his monies back!

18:48.515 --> 18:50.849
So pull out the cashbox
from behind the couch!

18:50.851 --> 18:53.020
Now, before I blow out
these kneecaps!

19:02.496 --> 19:05.196
Colin, grab the cashbox.

19:05.198 --> 19:08.033
Grab the fucking cashbox!
Grab it!

19:08.035 --> 19:09.870
- Now give me the gun.
- That ain't gonna happen.

19:11.204 --> 19:13.805
- Uh, uh, uh!
- Now let's go. Go!

19:13.807 --> 19:15.874
Move!

19:15.876 --> 19:17.574
Faster!

19:17.576 --> 19:18.644
Get my coat!

19:19.779 --> 19:21.612
Is that your car?
Yes, it is.

19:21.614 --> 19:23.084
Good. Get in!

19:24.118 --> 19:25.219
Get in!

19:28.088 --> 19:29.721
Drive!

19:32.025 --> 19:34.826
Lulu!
Where you going?

19:34.828 --> 19:37.062
Come back here,
sweetie!

19:37.064 --> 19:41.199
She's gone, Shane, and she's
taken the fucking money!

19:41.201 --> 19:43.801
Oh, really, Tyrone?

19:43.803 --> 19:46.639
'Cause I wasn't here. Tell me
what else fucking happened!

19:47.908 --> 19:50.775
Are we taking the
cashbox to Adjay? No!

19:50.777 --> 19:52.944
We're not.
No.

19:52.946 --> 19:56.848
And I will be asking the
questions now. Okay.

19:56.850 --> 19:58.783
We're going
on an adventure, Colin.

19:58.785 --> 20:01.886
Do you like adventures?
I do.

20:01.888 --> 20:03.854
Adventures... I like them.
Do you promise?

20:03.856 --> 20:05.789
I like adventures, yeah.

20:05.791 --> 20:08.193
Good.

20:08.195 --> 20:10.964
Are you a good guy or a bad guy?
I'm a good guy.

20:12.933 --> 20:14.267
Good.

20:36.656 --> 20:38.256
Good evening.
My name is Lawrence.

20:38.258 --> 20:40.125
Welcome
to the Moorhouse Hotel.

20:40.127 --> 20:41.993
Thank you, Lawrence.

20:41.995 --> 20:43.596
We would like a room.

20:47.767 --> 20:52.203
Oh, that looks fun. Is Mr. Luff
Linn staying here too?

20:52.205 --> 20:55.839
It's Luff Linn.
Two words.

20:55.841 --> 20:59.744
Oh, and we'll need a room
with two twins' beds, please.

20:59.746 --> 21:02.914
Is it two twins' beds
or two twins bed?

21:02.916 --> 21:04.084
Or is it two twin bed?

21:06.887 --> 21:09.620
I'm not really sure about that
kind of thing. I'm just not...

21:09.622 --> 21:11.924
Perhaps we should ask
Mr. Beverly.

21:15.895 --> 21:19.229
Oh, lookee here. It looks
like you're in lucky.

21:19.231 --> 21:22.066
Is breakfast included?
We'll take it.

21:22.068 --> 21:24.304
Wonderful.
Key time.

21:27.674 --> 21:30.275
Magical event.

21:30.277 --> 21:32.946
Magical Luff Linn.

21:37.417 --> 21:41.319
Okay, well, this is
my kind of hotel room.

21:41.321 --> 21:43.122
You take that bed.

21:44.824 --> 21:46.760
Okay.

21:57.937 --> 22:00.106
Colin, do you think you
could give me a massage?

22:02.007 --> 22:04.007
Yes.

22:04.009 --> 22:05.678
I can do that.

22:12.719 --> 22:14.387
Like this?
Mm-hmm.

22:15.288 --> 22:16.888
How's this?

22:16.890 --> 22:18.158
Mm-hmm.

22:19.059 --> 22:21.394
- And this?
- Mm-hmm.

22:27.967 --> 22:30.834
I needed to get away
from my husband.

22:30.836 --> 22:34.171
Aren't you worried about
people coming after us?

22:34.173 --> 22:36.241
Adjay must be
very upset and angry.

22:36.243 --> 22:39.410
Adjay would never
come after us.

22:39.412 --> 22:42.413
He's had terrifying panic
attacks since we were children

22:42.415 --> 22:44.850
because he choked on too
much breast milk as a baby.

22:46.051 --> 22:48.386
I didn't know that
was a possibility.

22:48.388 --> 22:50.256
Choking on breast milk?

22:52.124 --> 22:54.791
Choking on
too much breast milk.

22:54.793 --> 22:56.128
Mm-hmm.

23:00.100 --> 23:02.435
Okay, that's enough.
Thank you.

23:07.507 --> 23:10.941
Colin, I need you
to protect me, okay?

23:10.943 --> 23:13.410
Can you handle that?
Yes, I can do that.

23:13.412 --> 23:15.513
Are you sure you don't have
any other commitments?

23:15.515 --> 23:18.048
No, I don't have
any other commitments.

23:18.050 --> 23:20.884
In fact, putting myself in harm's
way for the benefit of others

23:20.886 --> 23:22.755
is exactly what I do.

23:24.924 --> 23:26.226
Good.

23:32.865 --> 23:36.202
I'm going to take a bath.
Why don't you watch?

23:37.803 --> 23:39.171
TV.

24:17.910 --> 24:19.211
Here comes din-dins.

24:22.348 --> 24:27.517
You buckled up?

24:27.519 --> 24:30.923
Right. Let's try and find this hotel that
apparently no one knows the name of.

24:45.304 --> 24:47.371
Have you heard anything
from Lulu?

24:47.373 --> 24:48.972
I haven't heard
anything.

24:52.278 --> 24:55.381
Hello, Shane!
Do you have my money?

24:58.016 --> 25:00.485
No, Adjay.
Have you talked to Colin?

25:00.487 --> 25:03.621
Colin is
a double-crossing shit!

25:03.623 --> 25:06.056
Well, my wife and your
money are with him,

25:06.058 --> 25:07.891
so you might want
to track him down.

25:07.893 --> 25:11.928
Track him down, Shane?
I'm a fucking vegan!

25:11.930 --> 25:16.300
I'm coming every day until
you find my fucking money!

25:16.302 --> 25:19.003
Did you hear me,
you fat loser?

25:22.308 --> 25:25.543
Adjay, please leave! You're
causing a disturbance!

25:25.545 --> 25:27.311
Now!

25:27.313 --> 25:31.381
I will leave, and then
I will come back again

25:31.383 --> 25:35.619
for my fucking M-O-N-E-Y!

25:35.621 --> 25:37.356
Aaah!

25:40.892 --> 25:42.392
Wow.

25:42.394 --> 25:45.027
Why has my wife run off
with a fucking criminal?

25:45.029 --> 25:47.097
Maybe she was sexually
attracted to him.

25:47.099 --> 25:50.469
I've definitely read women are
attracted to mens with guns.

25:52.237 --> 25:53.570
Mens?

25:53.572 --> 25:56.606
Yeah, the gun
is like a penis.

25:56.608 --> 25:59.545
Yeah, the male penis.

26:08.620 --> 26:10.621
Why are we buying
all these outfits?

26:10.623 --> 26:13.192
Because I need outfits,
Colin.

26:19.231 --> 26:22.332
I'm gonna be honest
with you.

26:22.334 --> 26:25.535
Although I don't know
quite what's going on,

26:25.537 --> 26:26.971
I'm having a great time,
Lulu.

26:28.707 --> 26:30.376
And...

26:32.110 --> 26:35.314
And you nailed it with these
cheesy onion rings. Mmm.

26:36.949 --> 26:39.149
Listen.

26:39.151 --> 26:42.085
There is an event
tomorrow night at the hotel.

26:42.087 --> 26:43.389
We're going to it. Okay?

26:44.289 --> 26:45.655
An event?

26:45.657 --> 26:48.057
Do you remember the man
in the plaid hat

26:48.059 --> 26:51.127
from the large man-shaped poster
near the hotel reception?

26:51.129 --> 26:52.431
Mr. Beverly.

26:54.031 --> 26:57.266
- Beverly's a woman's name.
- No, I don't think so.

26:57.268 --> 26:59.369
It is. It's a Scottish
woman's name.

26:59.371 --> 27:02.239
- Beverly is a man's name.
- It's a very feminine name.

27:02.241 --> 27:05.475
No, it isn't, Colin.
It's a very masculine name.

27:05.477 --> 27:07.711
I went to school
with a girl called Beverly.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.516
No, Colin.
Beverly is a man's name.

27:11.683 --> 27:13.517
Beverly is a woman's name.

27:13.519 --> 27:15.387
No, Colin.
Beverly is a man's name.

27:18.055 --> 27:19.123
Okay.

27:24.731 --> 27:26.563
Oh, my goodness.

27:26.565 --> 27:27.666
Mmm.

27:28.634 --> 27:32.135
Oh, this is so indulgent.

27:32.137 --> 27:34.304
I'm gonna need to do
some exercise after this.

27:34.306 --> 27:36.140
Ugh.

27:44.482 --> 27:46.516
Can you
please wipe your mouth?

27:46.518 --> 27:48.220
That's absolutely disgusting.

27:59.096 --> 28:01.063
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

28:01.065 --> 28:03.034
Just get the stuff
out of the back.

28:19.818 --> 28:22.218
I believe we have a junior
suite on reservation.

28:22.220 --> 28:24.119
Yes.

28:24.121 --> 28:26.556
We have you
in our Loch Lomond suite

28:26.558 --> 28:28.557
with a balcony
and a pool view.

28:28.559 --> 28:31.660
Would you like me to keep the reservation
charges under Von Dongschlonger?

28:31.662 --> 28:33.762
It's Von Donkensteiger.

28:33.764 --> 28:36.466
- Is that German?
- Yes.

28:36.468 --> 28:39.569
Actually, my father was a German shepherd.
He looked quite like you.

28:39.571 --> 28:42.741
- You mean like the dog?
- Yeah, like the woof-woof.

28:43.642 --> 28:45.442
Hmm.

28:45.444 --> 28:47.444
We are very excited for

28:47.446 --> 28:50.747
<i>An Evening
with Beverly Luff Linn</i>

28:50.749 --> 28:53.618
for one magical night only.

28:55.419 --> 28:57.121
Hmm.

28:59.858 --> 29:02.094
You look more like a dog
than a dog does.

29:17.675 --> 29:19.277
No.

29:52.611 --> 29:55.814
One of those jets is shooting
water up the back of my shorts.

29:58.382 --> 30:00.618
Its quite
a delicious feeling.

30:19.671 --> 30:20.706
Uhh!

30:40.726 --> 30:41.860
Uhh!

30:42.894 --> 30:53.738
Waaah!

31:15.626 --> 31:17.628
Lets go downstairs.

31:21.632 --> 31:24.266
Good evening.
I'm the captain.

31:24.268 --> 31:26.402
What can I get
you folks?

31:26.404 --> 31:28.537
I would like
a Rumble in the Heather.

31:28.539 --> 31:30.241
And I'll have
a Rum and a Ramble.

31:30.876 --> 31:32.878
Coming up.

31:34.478 --> 31:36.645
You know, those might
have poo on them.

31:36.647 --> 31:39.648
You don't want to get poo
in your mouth, do you?

31:39.650 --> 31:42.584
Oh, no. No, we're not
eating these poo nuts.

31:42.586 --> 31:45.587
Here you go, ma'am.
Here's your drink.

31:45.589 --> 31:47.456
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you, Captain.

31:47.458 --> 31:50.694
And, uh, let's get
some fresh nuts, huh?

31:50.696 --> 31:53.664
Poo nuts. You know
what I'm talking about.

31:57.668 --> 31:59.370
And here's my nuts.

32:04.041 --> 32:06.608
I feel like we've been
on the go for days,

32:06.610 --> 32:09.812
and we haven't had any time
to just sit and catch up.

32:09.814 --> 32:12.347
Well, I'm really glad that
we're getting to catch up,

32:12.349 --> 32:13.883
but we're not really
on the go.

32:13.885 --> 32:16.318
We're on the run.
Your brother's after us.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.321
I wouldn't be surprised if he kills
me, but I think you'll be fine.

32:19.323 --> 32:21.557
You know, you can be
really depressing sometimes.

32:21.559 --> 32:23.292
I don't find myself
depressing.

32:23.294 --> 32:25.296
Here's to not being depressing.
I don't think I am depressing.

32:31.001 --> 32:32.868
Here comes Mr. Beverly.

32:32.870 --> 32:36.338
He makes you nervous,
doesn't he?

32:36.340 --> 32:38.607
And he's with his bearded friend,
and they're coming this way.

32:38.609 --> 32:40.709
What a lovely evening,
isn't it?

32:40.711 --> 32:42.644
Yes, it is.

32:42.646 --> 32:44.713
Oh, uh, Colin.

32:44.715 --> 32:48.452
Rodney.
Rodney, this is Lulu.

33:00.531 --> 33:02.664
Mr. Rodney, I believe
your booth is ready.

33:02.666 --> 33:04.702
Come with me, please.
Absolutely.

33:14.745 --> 33:17.347
He's not very chatty,
is he, Mr. Beverly?

33:31.729 --> 33:34.530
You know, I feel like I don't
know anything about you, Colin.

33:34.532 --> 33:36.031
Why don't you
tell me something?

33:36.033 --> 33:38.466
Why don't you tell me
the story of Colin?

33:38.468 --> 33:40.771
You better settle in 'cause it's
a long and interesting tale.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.040
Okay.

33:45.042 --> 33:47.442
So, my father's name
was Keith,

33:47.444 --> 33:50.079
and his father
was also called Keith.

33:50.081 --> 33:53.081
Uh, so that's two generations
of Keiths in my family,

33:53.083 --> 33:55.384
so it's a bit of a tradition.

33:55.386 --> 33:59.721
And my father had an Uncle
Colin who he loved very much.

33:59.723 --> 34:03.992
And he loved the name Colin and he
wanted to be called Colin himself.

34:03.994 --> 34:06.694
In fact, sometimes he would
introduce himself to people

34:06.696 --> 34:09.563
calling himself Colin
as a joke.

34:09.565 --> 34:12.734
Anyway, he looked up
the name Colin,

34:12.735 --> 34:16.505
and it meant
small, young dog.

34:16.507 --> 34:19.708
And so when I was born,
he thought,

34:19.710 --> 34:21.610
he looks like
a small, young dog,

34:21.612 --> 34:24.414
and he named me Colin
because I was born with teeth.

34:28.751 --> 34:30.087
What?

34:31.888 --> 34:33.090
That's it?

34:39.563 --> 34:42.797
That is by far the most uninteresting
story I have ever heard.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.902
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.914
We should go sit with them.
Come on.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.451
Let's go.

35:12.863 --> 35:14.731
Oh, do you mind
if we join you?

35:17.234 --> 35:19.700
We haven't properly
met yet, Mr. Beverly.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.606
It's Mr. Luff Linn,
and it's two words.

35:28.112 --> 35:30.112
Luff Linn.

35:30.114 --> 35:32.814
Beverly, this is Colin,
and this is Lulu.

35:37.087 --> 35:39.221
Beverly and I
are partners.

35:39.223 --> 35:42.590
Ah, you are...
you're partners. Ah.

35:42.592 --> 35:44.527
It's a platonic union.

35:45.862 --> 35:47.765
That sounds nice.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.833
- Is it nice?
- Yes.

35:51.835 --> 35:53.735
I mean, it's difficult
to describe,

35:53.737 --> 35:56.637
but let's just say that we
love each other very much.

35:56.639 --> 35:58.572
Colin and I are married.

36:01.778 --> 36:04.181
How long have you been married for?
Two months.

36:06.082 --> 36:07.949
It's funny, isn't it?

36:07.951 --> 36:11.987
You come into a shithole town
in the middle of nowhere,

36:11.989 --> 36:13.989
like this,

36:13.991 --> 36:16.925
and suddenly everything's
very difficult.

36:16.927 --> 36:20.162
I have to buy Beverly
this tea that he loves.

36:20.164 --> 36:22.998
The Earl Grey. I'm sure
you haven't heard of it.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.967
So, I went into the local
village this morning,

36:25.969 --> 36:29.204
and I gotta say,
it was a real struggle,

36:29.206 --> 36:31.007
but eventually
I found it,

36:32.608 --> 36:35.811
and, uh, Beverly
has the satisfaction

36:35.813 --> 36:37.612
of getting the tea
that he loves,

36:37.614 --> 36:39.613
and I have
the satisfaction

36:39.615 --> 36:42.583
of being the one
who got it for him.

36:42.585 --> 36:44.821
Are you gonna put an
earring back in that hole?

36:46.123 --> 36:48.225
Hmm?

36:51.328 --> 36:54.831
Yes.

37:01.105 --> 37:02.272
Do excuse us.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.912
You should put an earring
back in that hole.

37:11.914 --> 37:13.716
You should do
what they say.

37:25.996 --> 37:28.598
Let it out and play.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.601
Come on, Bev.

37:34.103 --> 37:35.905
That's it.

37:37.073 --> 37:39.042
Let it out.

37:40.810 --> 37:43.146
Let that devil out.

37:46.150 --> 37:49.151
There she blows.

37:49.153 --> 37:51.155
There she blows.

38:28.991 --> 38:30.958
You look tired, Shane.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.795
- I hit the bottle last night.
- Me too.

38:33.797 --> 38:37.932
- Brenda finally kicked me out.
- Isn't Brenda your cousin?

38:37.934 --> 38:41.369
Yeah. I don't think she's attracted
to me anymore 'cause I got fat.

38:41.371 --> 38:44.306
Oh, I thought
you were always fat.

38:44.308 --> 38:47.810
- No, I used to be skinny.
- I think it's great that you're dating your cousin, Tyrone.

38:48.778 --> 38:49.879
Thank you, Shane.

38:54.283 --> 38:57.017
What the fuck is that,
Carl?

38:57.019 --> 38:59.822
It's a poster. Some bearded guy
dropped it off last night.

39:00.690 --> 39:02.324
Bearded guy?
Yeah.

39:02.326 --> 39:04.694
He looked like Michael McDonald
from the Doobie Brothers.

39:05.828 --> 39:07.697
Who are
the Doobie Brothers?

39:08.798 --> 39:11.234
Beverly Luff Linn.

39:13.970 --> 39:17.471
<i>It's the same black guy</i>
<i>from the poster at the store,</i>

39:17.473 --> 39:20.341
and that's Lulu with him
in every single photograph.

39:20.343 --> 39:22.743
Yes, Tyrone.

39:22.745 --> 39:26.115
It looks like they're having a
pretty great time together, Shane.

39:27.183 --> 39:29.116
Tyrone.

39:29.118 --> 39:30.985
Listen to me.

39:30.987 --> 39:32.722
This man is in town.

39:34.023 --> 39:37.458
He's having an event
at the Moorhouse Hotel.

39:37.460 --> 39:40.161
I don't know
what this event is,

39:40.163 --> 39:42.298
but Lulu's gone missing.

39:45.368 --> 39:46.903
Tyrone.

39:49.373 --> 39:54.108
We need to go to the hotel,
immediately, to see if she's there.

39:54.110 --> 39:55.876
Yes, we do Shane.

39:55.878 --> 39:58.412
We need to go to the hotel
immediately to see if she's there.

39:58.414 --> 40:00.414
Immediately.
Immediately.

40:00.416 --> 40:02.082
Immediately.
Immediately.

40:02.084 --> 40:03.816
Immediately.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.419
Immediately.

40:05.421 --> 40:07.421
Immediately.
Immediately.

40:07.423 --> 40:09.290
Immediately.
Immediately.

40:09.292 --> 40:10.824
Immediately.
Immediately.

40:10.826 --> 40:12.929
Immediately.
Immediately.

40:14.297 --> 40:15.865
Immediately.

40:17.967 --> 40:19.500
Good evening.
My name is Lawrence.

40:19.502 --> 40:20.937
Welcome
to the Moorhouse Hotel.

40:22.104 --> 40:24.438
That man there,
is he in the hotel?

40:24.440 --> 40:27.174
I need to see him. I must speak with him.
It's urgent.

40:27.176 --> 40:29.312
Sir, you're more than welcome to
wait in our captain's lounge.

40:30.912 --> 40:32.446
Is the captain
in his lounge?

40:32.448 --> 40:36.219
No, the captain is not
in his <i>fucking</i> lounge!

41:01.944 --> 41:03.946
Mmm.

41:10.186 --> 41:12.953
I love cold beer!
I gave you cold beer!

41:12.955 --> 41:14.988
I love cold beer!

41:14.990 --> 41:16.457
I gave you cold beer!

41:16.459 --> 41:18.592
I love cold beer!

41:21.229 --> 41:24.000
Whoo.

41:33.209 --> 41:36.045
I know, I know.
We'll sort it out.

41:46.055 --> 41:48.522
You're late, Tyrone.
What happened?

41:48.524 --> 41:50.557
I was worried stiff.

41:50.559 --> 41:53.394
He's there, Shane. They got a
life-sized poster of him in the lobby.

41:53.396 --> 41:55.531
He's being pushed around in a
wheelchair by the bearded man.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.234
Hello, Shane!
You look fat today!

42:00.236 --> 42:04.371
Like I said, I'm coming back
every day, and here I am!

42:04.373 --> 42:06.407
Where is my fucking money?

42:06.409 --> 42:10.880
I don't have your money, Adjay.
But do you know this man?

42:17.086 --> 42:19.153
Where the fuck
did this come from?

42:19.155 --> 42:22.589
This guy who looked like Michael McDonald
from the Doobie Brothers dropped it off.

42:22.591 --> 42:24.325
There's a big event
happening.

42:24.327 --> 42:28.194
Adjay, I found a box of
pictures of Lulu with this man.

42:28.196 --> 42:30.431
It was hidden
in her underwear drawer.

42:30.433 --> 42:32.165
That man is dead!

42:32.167 --> 42:33.901
That man ain't dead.

42:33.903 --> 42:37.237
That man is in a wheelchair
at the Moorhouse Hotel.

42:37.239 --> 42:41.442
That man is dead!
That man fucking drowned!

42:41.444 --> 42:44.645
And I want my fucking money, Shane!

42:44.647 --> 42:47.048
That man ain't dead.

42:59.161 --> 43:00.363
Hello?

43:05.401 --> 43:10.169
Show delayed 24 hours
for a medical emergency?

43:10.171 --> 43:11.474
Excuse me.

43:12.475 --> 43:14.708
I don't understand.

43:14.710 --> 43:17.176
Wait, there's Rodney.
Ask him what's going on.

43:17.178 --> 43:18.980
I'm going in.

43:20.248 --> 43:22.316
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Mr. Rodney.

43:22.318 --> 43:24.451
Is everything okay
with Mr. Beverly?

43:24.453 --> 43:27.154
Mr. Luff Linn just needs
some peace and quiet.

43:27.156 --> 43:28.722
He doesn't need
to be disturbed.

43:28.724 --> 43:30.290
Is he dead?

43:30.292 --> 43:32.961
I have no idea.
I'm not a doctor.

43:36.732 --> 43:41.401
I just don't understand why you're so
stressed out about this Mr. Beverly event.

43:41.403 --> 43:43.970
I realize
you don't understand.

43:43.972 --> 43:45.608
The thing is,
I do understand.

43:47.176 --> 43:48.709
Okay, then,
you know what?

43:48.711 --> 43:51.578
I'm going out, and I'm
gonna feast on snacks!

43:51.580 --> 43:56.517
Good! I hope you feast on snacks and
you get so fat that your pants split!

43:56.519 --> 43:59.352
Oh, you would love it
if my pants split!

43:59.354 --> 44:00.556
I would!

44:07.295 --> 44:09.496
I see you're writing again.

44:09.498 --> 44:12.201
Come on. I'll run you a bath.

44:15.671 --> 44:18.739
I saw that
dreadful couple downstairs.

44:18.741 --> 44:21.508
They seem pretty pissed off
that the show's been postponed.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.487
Well, well, well.

44:35.491 --> 44:39.693
Um, I think I'm gonna have
a bit of a siesta now.

44:39.695 --> 44:40.696
Mmm.

44:43.632 --> 44:47.333
You really should
start writing again.

44:47.335 --> 44:50.438
You write beautifully. You
have a real way with words.

45:34.616 --> 45:37.085
Yes, I will make sure
that she gets it.

45:43.191 --> 45:45.726
I just saw Mr. Beverly,
and he looked fine.

45:45.728 --> 45:47.861
Exceptionally healthy,
in fact.

45:47.863 --> 45:51.598
And I saw magical
event posters all over town.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.499
What are you
thinking about?

45:53.501 --> 45:55.401
Because I'll tell you
what I'm thinking about.

45:55.403 --> 45:58.137
I'm thinking about how I met your
fat brother in the Laundromat,

45:58.139 --> 46:01.107
and I was promised
to be paid $200,

46:01.109 --> 46:02.875
of which I have
received nothing!

46:02.877 --> 46:06.345
I'm a professional!
I make things happen!

46:06.347 --> 46:08.781
And now what do I do?
I'm just protecting you

46:08.783 --> 46:11.518
so that you can see Mr. Beverly
and his magic event.

46:11.520 --> 46:16.589
And I haven't even mentioned his fat,
bearded, chipmunk-faced piggy partner

46:16.591 --> 46:20.562
who needs a punch right in his
tightly packed poo-filled anus hole!

46:23.164 --> 46:25.431
I'll pay you the $200,
okay?

46:25.433 --> 46:27.433
No, no, no.
It's not about that.

46:27.435 --> 46:29.769
It's not about the money
Ah, no!

46:29.771 --> 46:32.572
It's not about the money!

46:32.574 --> 46:36.077
Now Colin's opened his big,
hairy trap, and Lulu hates him!

46:42.617 --> 46:44.152
Colin.

46:50.491 --> 46:52.725
I have an idea.

46:52.727 --> 46:56.629
How about the two of us go out for
an old-fashioned night on the town?

46:56.631 --> 46:58.534
What do you say?

47:00.568 --> 47:02.437
I'd really like that.

47:05.874 --> 47:08.407
Lets paint the town,
Colin.

47:12.847 --> 47:15.617
Oh. I need to go
to the toilet.

47:18.386 --> 47:19.721
Okay.

47:31.199 --> 47:32.732
Oh, my God.
Why are you here?

47:32.734 --> 47:35.201
I found this box
in your underwear drawer

47:35.203 --> 47:38.604
with all these pictures of you
and the Luff Linn poster man.

47:38.606 --> 47:39.874
Is this why you're here?

47:43.878 --> 47:46.647
Let go of me!
Is he still alive?

47:46.649 --> 47:48.882
Because I heard
he was dead.

47:48.884 --> 47:51.319
Get off of me.

47:52.420 --> 47:55.454
Security! This man
is accosting me!

47:55.456 --> 47:57.525
Security! Security!

47:58.760 --> 48:02.928
Ow! My fucking ear,
you fat fuck! Aaah!

48:12.807 --> 48:16.611
Who the fuck
is Beverly Luff Linn?

48:21.816 --> 48:25.017
Oh, shit!
What happened, Shane?

48:25.019 --> 48:27.187
Got kicked
in the stomach.

48:29.624 --> 48:32.524
I gotta go get my mom
from the clinic.

48:32.526 --> 48:34.262
That's fine.
Just drive.

48:36.564 --> 48:38.733
Did you get kicked hard?

48:39.967 --> 48:42.270
I should've blown
out his kneecaps.

48:43.805 --> 48:45.673
I'm very protective.

48:50.912 --> 48:52.978
You put your earring
back in, didn't you?

48:52.980 --> 48:55.917
Oh, yes.
Yeah, I did.

48:57.853 --> 48:59.687
The mystery of Colin
is deepening.

49:01.956 --> 49:04.392
Go deeper, if you dare.

49:08.763 --> 49:11.499
May I indulge you
in a childhood story?

49:12.533 --> 49:14.669
Give it to me, Colin.

49:17.370 --> 49:20.605
My grandmother Eileen used
to have these hard candies

49:20.607 --> 49:22.475
that were dusted
in icing sugar.

49:22.477 --> 49:24.744
They were a real treat
to be had.

49:24.746 --> 49:27.646
Now I'm getting to the
major part of the story.

49:27.648 --> 49:30.585
When I was a little boy,
I didn't like to, uh...

49:31.853 --> 49:33.819
do poo-poos inside,

49:33.821 --> 49:36.822
so I would march
into the wood for hours

49:36.824 --> 49:39.591
just waiting until I
had to go, you know.

49:41.795 --> 49:43.828
And I would just do it
right there in the woods,

49:43.830 --> 49:45.765
or I would do it
on a rock,

49:45.767 --> 49:48.667
or I would, um, dig a little
hole and cover it with leaves.

49:48.669 --> 49:52.340
But it's not the way that we want
little boys to go potty, is it?

49:53.808 --> 49:55.674
No, it is not.

49:55.676 --> 49:59.879
So, my grandmother very cleverly
decided to give me these candies,

49:59.881 --> 50:01.613
which I was crazy about,

50:01.615 --> 50:02.917
whenever...

50:04.618 --> 50:06.887
doo-doos would come out
indoors.

50:08.789 --> 50:11.590
So, whenever
I went poopy inside,

50:11.592 --> 50:15.761
I would run down the hallway yelling,
"Grammy, Grammy! Come and look in the bowl!

50:15.763 --> 50:17.563
Come and look
in the bowl!"

50:17.565 --> 50:20.498
And then we would all gather around
the bowl and just look inside

50:20.500 --> 50:22.737
and count the doo-doos,
and guess what.

50:25.072 --> 50:26.671
What?

50:26.673 --> 50:29.440
She would give me
a piece of candy

50:29.442 --> 50:33.412
for every piece of... poo-poo
that I would produce.

50:33.414 --> 50:36.651
One time I got
14 pieces of candy.

50:40.721 --> 50:42.922
Grammy passed away
some time ago.

50:42.924 --> 50:45.557
She was hit in the back
of her head with a hammer.

50:45.559 --> 50:48.994
Okay, enough stories.
It's time.

50:48.996 --> 50:50.965
I'm gonna
lay it on the line.

50:54.168 --> 50:58.504
Lulu, I may be a great deal
younger than you,

50:58.506 --> 51:00.906
but I think you're
the most beautiful,

51:00.908 --> 51:04.045
most interesting woman
that I have ever met.

51:05.746 --> 51:09.714
And yes, I know everybody
else thinks that too.

51:09.716 --> 51:12.584
But I need to know...

51:12.586 --> 51:14.452
and please
be honest with me...

51:14.454 --> 51:15.856
I need to know...

51:17.457 --> 51:20.560
if any part of you
is attracted...

51:22.430 --> 51:23.831
to any part of me.

51:38.545 --> 51:40.445
This is so unexpected.

51:40.447 --> 51:42.847
That's okay. You don't have
to answer immediately.

51:42.849 --> 51:45.618
Look, I'm just in a very emotional
place right now, you know?

51:45.620 --> 51:48.020
I just left my husband, and I
have this event tomorrow night.

51:48.022 --> 51:50.789
Colin! Colin! Colin!
Colin! Colin!

51:50.791 --> 51:54.862
Selfish! Selfish!
Selfish! Selfish!

51:59.966 --> 52:01.666
Crabs.

52:01.668 --> 52:03.003
Yummy!

52:07.474 --> 52:11.110
I had tickets
to the magical Luff Linn,

52:11.112 --> 52:14.115
but I heard he had
been delayed 24 hours.

52:17.952 --> 52:23.757
What makes the Luff Linn
so... magical, Mrs. Paris?

53:02.029 --> 53:03.630
Ah! Ah!

53:09.236 --> 53:11.303
Psst.

53:11.305 --> 53:12.806
Miss Lulu.

53:18.678 --> 53:20.546
Yes?
I have this for you.

53:26.220 --> 53:28.089
Thank you.
Good evening.

53:31.858 --> 53:33.825
What did
Mr. Lawrence want?

53:33.827 --> 53:37.729
He was just making sure
you were protecting me.

53:37.731 --> 53:39.099
I am.

53:46.107 --> 53:47.975
Gonna go
get ready for bed.

54:28.014 --> 54:30.984
Hmm?

54:33.653 --> 54:35.056
Is this our song?

54:35.855 --> 54:37.289
Mmm!

54:37.291 --> 54:39.025
Lord,
this brings back memories.

54:40.193 --> 54:41.928
Endless nights
at the Lamb and Lily.

54:43.363 --> 54:45.065
First time I saw you.

54:46.366 --> 54:48.766
You looked very smart
with your orange hat.

54:48.768 --> 54:50.770
Mmm.

54:53.239 --> 54:55.273
Right, tea and bed, Bev.

55:14.060 --> 55:16.394
You look relaxed,
Colin.

55:16.396 --> 55:18.162
Yeah, I'm just reading
about Palominos.

55:18.164 --> 55:20.664
They're a very
sought-after parade horse.

55:20.666 --> 55:22.035
Very pretty horse,
I must say.

55:26.005 --> 55:27.941
Well, I'm wiped.

55:30.343 --> 55:31.611
Good night.

55:33.847 --> 55:35.982
Would you like me to read
you a couple of paragraphs?

55:38.952 --> 55:40.251
No, thanks.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.071
There we go.

56:45.751 --> 56:49.189
You look surprised.
You expecting somebody else?

56:51.857 --> 56:54.458
No.
No? Good.

56:54.460 --> 56:57.529
'Cause there'll be nobody else
performing here tonight.

56:57.531 --> 56:59.432
The show's over.

57:28.228 --> 57:30.930
Mmm!

57:47.080 --> 57:50.216
Yes. Yes.

57:54.254 --> 57:55.919
No!
Yes.

57:55.921 --> 57:58.589
No. Oh, God. No.

57:58.591 --> 58:00.591
I'm sorry. I must have
gotten in the wrong bed.

58:00.593 --> 58:03.293
I like you in my bed.
It's fine. No.

58:03.295 --> 58:05.362
It's fine. I like you in my bed.
No, it's not fine. No, Colin.

58:05.364 --> 58:07.866
It's not fine.
I'm sorry.

58:11.471 --> 58:15.039
Actually, Colin,
I have my period.

58:15.041 --> 58:17.974
Can you run to the drugstore and
get me some heavy flow tampons?

58:17.976 --> 58:20.313
The green box.
It's an emergency.

58:21.347 --> 58:23.283
I'm going
as fast as I can.

58:47.139 --> 58:48.905
Good morning, Lawrence.

58:48.907 --> 58:50.206
Good morning, Miss Lulu.

58:50.208 --> 58:54.344
Can you please see that
this gets to Mr. Luff Linn?

58:54.346 --> 59:00.117
It must be delivered to him when his male
bearded partner is not present, is that clear?

59:00.119 --> 59:02.088
He will receive the
message right away.

59:03.423 --> 59:05.991
Thank you.
Ta-ta.

59:18.303 --> 59:20.907
Skinny little pig.

59:26.011 --> 59:29.447
Strong coffee, Bev.
This should wake you up.

59:29.449 --> 59:32.048
Mmm.

59:32.050 --> 59:38.388
I had to haul a special someone all the way from
the armchair to the queen-sized bed last night.

59:38.390 --> 59:41.224
Mmm.

59:41.226 --> 59:44.995
Now, this may look like a lot of
food, but you should eat all of it.

59:44.997 --> 59:46.630
Mmm.

59:46.632 --> 59:49.032
I'm just concerned about your health.
I'm not badgering.

59:49.034 --> 59:51.101
Mmm.

59:51.103 --> 59:53.604
Good morning to you both.

59:53.606 --> 59:55.506
My name is Kennedy Gordon.

59:55.508 --> 59:59.342
I am the manager
of the Moorhouse Hotel.

59:59.344 --> 01:00:03.646
- It is a pleasure finally having you stay with us.
- Mmm.

01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:08.318
I also wanted to check in with you regarding
our evening with Beverly Luff Linn

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.723
and whether we're all set
for this evening?

01:00:12.725 --> 01:00:16.394
Yes, at this precise moment, I would say we
are all set for this evening's performance.

01:00:16.396 --> 01:00:20.964
Isn't that right, Bev? Mmm.

01:00:20.966 --> 01:00:25.170
Oh, and Lawrence asked me to give you
this letter in private, Mr. Luff Linn.

01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:43.255
Um, please enjoy your breakfast!

01:00:44.757 --> 01:00:46.391
Shall we open it?

01:00:59.037 --> 01:01:03.173
<i>So, I get up at 1:00 a.m.
to see you alone, finally,</i>

01:01:03.175 --> 01:01:05.241
<i>and you send your creepy
bearded partner.</i>

01:01:05.243 --> 01:01:06.777
<i>Why?</i>

01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:09.012
Anything interesting?

01:01:09.014 --> 01:01:10.382
Mmm.

01:01:14.252 --> 01:01:18.288
Right, when you finish that steak, those eggs,
that steak on that plate with those eggs,

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.191
the orange if you want,
and there's a boiled egg there.

01:01:21.193 --> 01:01:23.727
The toast, and I want you
to have the jam with the toast.

01:01:23.729 --> 01:01:26.630
We're gonna hit the fitness center and
loosen your hips for this evening.

01:01:26.632 --> 01:01:29.132
Mmm!

01:01:36.575 --> 01:01:41.511
You're in great shape,
but your pelvis is kinked.

01:01:50.623 --> 01:01:54.057
I got the... I had to go to three
different stores to get them.

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:56.459
The first store said they wouldn't
have them in for a month.

01:01:56.461 --> 01:01:59.162
I said, "That's no use. It's a monthly
cycle." And the second store...

01:02:03.301 --> 01:02:05.802
Listen to me, you little bitch.
We got your note.

01:02:05.804 --> 01:02:07.470
I told you to back off!

01:02:07.472 --> 01:02:09.405
You shouldn't speak to a
lady like that, Mr. Rodney.

01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:12.277
Shut up! This is
your final warning!

01:02:18.683 --> 01:02:21.851
What? Are you gonna
chew me out now too?

01:02:21.853 --> 01:02:22.787
How about you?

01:02:36.234 --> 01:02:38.270
Mmm.

01:02:46.144 --> 01:02:47.812
Drive!

01:02:58.423 --> 01:03:03.426
I just witnessed two male suspicious
figures driving a blue sports coupe.

01:03:03.428 --> 01:03:06.831
They were wearing wigs, and when
I noticed them they sped off.

01:03:08.533 --> 01:03:10.266
That'll be Shane and Tyrone.

01:03:10.268 --> 01:03:11.436
Oh.

01:03:18.442 --> 01:03:20.412
Colin, do you think you
could give me a massage?

01:03:22.848 --> 01:03:25.784
Yes, I can.

01:03:44.336 --> 01:03:47.170
You're getting really good
at this, Colin.

01:03:47.172 --> 01:03:48.771
Then you won't mind me
telling you

01:03:48.773 --> 01:03:51.608
that I saw Mr. Beverly in the
fitness center exercising,

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:53.111
and I pulled the finger at him.

01:03:53.778 --> 01:03:55.178
What?

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.313
Colin, why did you do that?

01:03:58.315 --> 01:04:01.784
Look, I don't need you causing any more
trouble than there already is! Okay?

01:04:01.786 --> 01:04:04.286
Please!

01:04:04.288 --> 01:04:06.323
I'm going for a walk.

01:04:13.865 --> 01:04:17.467
You will always be alone, Colin,
with that big, hairy trap of yours!

01:04:17.469 --> 01:04:19.404
Why is it so hairy?

01:04:24.676 --> 01:04:25.877
Would you like to come with me?

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.148
I would like that.

01:04:32.784 --> 01:04:35.818
And thank you for the tampons.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.787
It was a pleasure
to buy you tampons.

01:04:45.664 --> 01:04:48.165
Mmm!

01:05:26.805 --> 01:05:28.671
Ooh.

01:05:28.673 --> 01:05:30.707
<i>Good afternoon. Yes, this
is Lawrence, Mr. Gordon.</i>

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:35.978
I have Mr. Rodney here,
Mr. Beverly Luff Linn's partner.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.815
Apparently, they would like to delay
the event for another 24 hours.

01:05:39.817 --> 01:05:40.983
Yes.

01:05:40.985 --> 01:05:42.484
Okay.

01:05:42.486 --> 01:05:43.719
Thank you very much.

01:05:43.721 --> 01:05:45.388
Well?

01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:48.326
Mr. Gordon will be here
very shortly.

01:05:58.837 --> 01:06:00.802
Good day, Mr. Rodney.

01:06:00.804 --> 01:06:02.606
Lovely to
see you again.

01:06:04.641 --> 01:06:07.843
Now, we have
a full hotel of guests

01:06:07.845 --> 01:06:11.581
anxiously awaiting <i>An Evening
with Beverly Luff Linn</i>

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:14.617
for one magical night only.

01:06:14.619 --> 01:06:19.858
And I am happy to accommodate your
request for another 24 hours, but...

01:06:22.827 --> 01:06:28.097
I am afraid there can be
no further delays after that.

01:06:28.099 --> 01:06:30.868
Am I being clear,
Mr. Rodney?

01:06:32.871 --> 01:06:34.873
Yes, you're being clear.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.339
Wonderful!

01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:38.543
Wonderful!

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.883
Wonderful.

01:06:51.655 --> 01:06:52.823
It's open!

01:07:02.867 --> 01:07:04.566
It's her.

01:07:04.568 --> 01:07:05.734
Are you sure?

01:07:05.736 --> 01:07:07.738
Of course, I'm sure.

01:07:10.574 --> 01:07:12.474
I have to say,
when Beverly Luff Linn

01:07:12.476 --> 01:07:16.480
said he had taken up with a man,
you are not what I expected.

01:07:17.414 --> 01:07:18.880
What are you, from Scotland?

01:07:18.882 --> 01:07:22.118
I met Beverly while I was
studying embroidery in Aberdeen.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:28.825
I don't give one or two or 17 fucks
what you were studying in Aberdeen

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:33.095
or
Edinburgh or-or the Orkney Islands,

01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:36.066
ya fucking bushy bearded cunt!

01:07:38.001 --> 01:07:40.001
I only pursued your request

01:07:40.003 --> 01:07:43.939
because that skinny little pig
ended our marriage.

01:07:43.941 --> 01:07:46.577
I wanted to see her in the flesh.
It's supposed to offer closure.

01:07:47.712 --> 01:07:50.913
- I see.
- How'd you get my number?

01:07:50.915 --> 01:07:55.717
Beverly gave it to me during one of our more
marinated sessions in the Lamb and Lily.

01:07:55.719 --> 01:07:57.719
He was suffering
from acute depression.

01:07:57.721 --> 01:07:59.855
He said if ever he was in
trouble, I had to contact you.

01:07:59.857 --> 01:08:01.425
Please don't contact me again!

01:08:05.596 --> 01:08:07.430
Ever again!

01:08:38.694 --> 01:08:41.197
Adjay, I've got good news.

01:08:41.198 --> 01:08:45.370
That guy Colin is at
the Moorhouse Hotel with Lulu.

01:08:46.169 --> 01:08:47.636
They should have your money.

01:08:47.638 --> 01:08:49.504
So?

01:08:49.506 --> 01:08:52.910
So, you should go there,
to the Moorhouse Hotel.

01:08:54.243 --> 01:08:57.078
There is something
you are not getting, Shane.

01:08:57.081 --> 01:08:59.215
It seems I was correct
to bring Edwin.

01:08:59.216 --> 01:09:00.617
Edwin!

01:09:05.856 --> 01:09:08.425
I hear you have a back room.
Can you take me there?

01:09:10.661 --> 01:09:11.895
Sure, Edwin.

01:09:35.719 --> 01:09:38.752
And I want my
fucking money, Shane!

01:09:45.263 --> 01:09:46.830
What happened
to your face, Shane?

01:09:48.665 --> 01:09:51.202
Edwin happened to my face,
you big, fat penis face.

01:10:01.144 --> 01:10:03.544
I wonder why
they postponed it again.

01:10:03.546 --> 01:10:05.015
Can we please
stop discussing it?

01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:12.787
How are we doing over here?

01:10:12.789 --> 01:10:15.659
Oh, uh, I'll have the usual.
Thanks, Captain.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:17.759
And for you, ma'am?

01:10:17.761 --> 01:10:19.894
No. Thank you.

01:10:19.896 --> 01:10:23.700
I'm not feeling so well,
so I'm going to go to my room.

01:10:25.202 --> 01:10:27.936
Maybe you're thirsty,
or hungry.

01:10:27.938 --> 01:10:30.271
Dehydrated
or low blood sugar.

01:10:30.273 --> 01:10:33.111
My God, Colin.
I just left my husband.

01:10:34.111 --> 01:10:36.144
Do you even remember that?

01:10:36.146 --> 01:10:37.912
I've been holed up
in this hotel for days

01:10:37.914 --> 01:10:42.150
because I'm desperate to see <i>An Evening with
Beverly Luff Linn</i> for one magical night only,

01:10:42.152 --> 01:10:44.686
and I don't know if
that's ever gonna happen.

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:47.255
And for some insane reason,
I'm being called a little bitch

01:10:47.257 --> 01:10:51.192
by Beverly's fat,
disgusting, creepy partner

01:10:51.194 --> 01:10:54.997
with his little chipmunk body shoved
into his pants with his little fat legs.

01:10:59.236 --> 01:11:01.738
So, no. I'm not feeling
very thirsty or hungry, okay?

01:11:04.174 --> 01:11:06.243
Okay.

01:11:10.914 --> 01:11:12.380
She's having her period.

01:11:12.382 --> 01:11:13.783
Oh, dear.

01:11:15.185 --> 01:11:18.087
I had to go to three stores
to get green tampons.

01:11:20.057 --> 01:11:21.925
Rum and a Ramble for you, sir?

01:11:28.265 --> 01:11:30.899
You have beautiful hands.

01:11:30.901 --> 01:11:33.303
These two stupid, fat hands?

01:11:35.939 --> 01:11:37.573
I'm Paulette.

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:43.212
Nice to meet you, Paulette.
I'm Colin.

01:12:27.457 --> 01:12:32.393
So, it's a bit of a tradition in my
family for the men to be named Keith,

01:12:32.395 --> 01:12:35.196
but my father just loved
the name Colin.

01:12:35.198 --> 01:12:39.336
And so it came to pass that
he named me, his only son...

01:12:40.203 --> 01:12:41.735
Colin.

01:12:41.737 --> 01:12:44.239
Colin Keith Threadener.

01:12:44.241 --> 01:12:45.706
So the Keith's
still in there.

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:51.281
Yeah, he was a bit
of a rebel, my father.

01:12:54.817 --> 01:12:58.920
You could fill me with your
stories all night long.

01:13:02.092 --> 01:13:04.361
Well, that's really nice to
hear that at a time like this.

01:13:06.729 --> 01:13:07.897
Hmm.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.734
Colin.

01:13:12.502 --> 01:13:14.168
Paulette.

01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:16.270
Is there someplace
we can be alone?

01:13:29.152 --> 01:13:31.787
Oh, that...
That was beautiful.

01:13:35.425 --> 01:13:36.792
I like you,
Paulette.

01:13:38.194 --> 01:13:42.031
Eh, it was good, sweetie.
It was good.

01:13:44.801 --> 01:13:48.102
Now... Uh-huh.

01:13:48.104 --> 01:13:49.504
Really good,
really good.

01:13:49.506 --> 01:13:51.941
Now that's gonna
cost ya 50 bucks.

01:13:54.477 --> 01:13:56.213
She usually
charges $80,

01:13:58.781 --> 01:14:02.550
but she said
I could pay 50,

01:14:02.552 --> 01:14:04.851
and we ended up settling
with me only paying 37.

01:14:04.853 --> 01:14:07.287
So, you had sex with a prostitute?
Yes.

01:14:07.289 --> 01:14:10.091
We went all the way.

01:14:10.093 --> 01:14:12.126
All the way up there as they say.

01:14:12.128 --> 01:14:13.829
Well, good for you,
Colin.

01:14:14.464 --> 01:14:15.931
Good night.

01:14:22.338 --> 01:14:26.008
I was a virgin,
and now I'm not.

01:14:28.444 --> 01:14:33.214
I understand that! I'm
letting them know right now!

01:14:33.216 --> 01:14:36.384
Valerie! You have to load the equipment
through the service entrance,

01:14:36.386 --> 01:14:38.051
not the main entrance!

01:14:38.053 --> 01:14:41.121
I don't know where the
fucking service entrance is!

01:14:41.123 --> 01:14:43.056
I need you to follow
the signs, Valerie!

01:14:43.058 --> 01:14:45.928
I can't hold your hand through this,
as much as you might like me to!

01:14:55.237 --> 01:14:58.541
Let's get this
baby seal out of bed.

01:15:00.277 --> 01:15:02.479
Here's your tea.

01:15:04.079 --> 01:15:07.149
Big night tonight. Showtime.

01:15:08.384 --> 01:15:11.184
Okay, your vaporizer is on.

01:15:11.186 --> 01:15:13.954
The sandalwood is infused
with lime and tangerine.

01:15:13.956 --> 01:15:17.958
The bath salts are by the tub. The
flexing mat is under the window.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.996
And your breakfast
is under the cloche.

01:15:23.233 --> 01:15:24.867
Are we magical?

01:15:25.635 --> 01:15:27.169
Hmm.

01:15:33.942 --> 01:15:36.443
Are you upset that I had sex
with a prostitute last night?

01:15:36.445 --> 01:15:40.981
No. Are you gonna get out of bed?
Today is the event!

01:15:40.983 --> 01:15:43.617
Help! I've slipped,
and I've fallen into the pond!

01:15:43.619 --> 01:15:48.256
Can anybody hear me? I'm trapped under
the ice! Who is Beverly Luff Linn?

01:15:48.258 --> 01:15:51.925
Help, I'm trapped!
Who is Beverly Luff Linn?

01:15:51.927 --> 01:15:55.062
Who is Beverly Luff Linn?
Who is...

01:15:55.064 --> 01:15:56.298
He was a poet.

01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:03.172
Okay?
He was my professor.

01:16:04.673 --> 01:16:10.380
We were a couple, and we
were passionately in love.

01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:21.955
One spring he took me
to the exotic island of Prami.

01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:27.927
There was a bird sanctuary there, and...
we had the best time.

01:16:27.929 --> 01:16:34.335
All we would do is hold hands
and sing to the birds.

01:16:34.337 --> 01:16:37.474
These funny little birds
with flat heads.

01:16:40.109 --> 01:16:41.510
Do you know
those kinds of birds?

01:16:42.444 --> 01:16:44.111
No.

01:16:44.113 --> 01:16:45.481
They're beautiful.

01:16:48.183 --> 01:16:49.618
It was heaven.

01:16:55.123 --> 01:17:00.630
But on the last day he said, "Lulu, I'm
going to take you to a secret cove."

01:17:02.331 --> 01:17:06.435
We went there,
and he swam ahead of me...

01:17:08.437 --> 01:17:10.437
out to this point,

01:17:10.439 --> 01:17:15.040
and I remember he looked
back, waved at me

01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:19.647
and then plunged deep
beneath the surface.

01:17:19.649 --> 01:17:22.617
And I tried to catch up to him.

01:17:22.619 --> 01:17:27.687
I swam so fast,
but he never came up,

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:31.527
and...
I couldn't find him.

01:17:35.164 --> 01:17:39.332
So I went back to the hotel and
our friend Cornelius was there.

01:17:39.334 --> 01:17:44.541
I remember crying in Cornelius's arms
when they told me that he was dead.

01:17:45.608 --> 01:17:48.043
Drowned.

01:17:50.512 --> 01:17:52.047
Probably eaten
by sharks.

01:17:55.551 --> 01:17:57.419
Why didn't you tell me
all this before?

01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:01.723
Because I've never told
anyone before.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.198
Except for Adjay. But he's not
interested unless it's vegan.

01:18:16.638 --> 01:18:19.239
I've never been in love,

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:20.409
at least
not until I met you.

01:18:24.212 --> 01:18:26.981
But not the kind that you're
talking about where it's mutual.

01:18:31.385 --> 01:18:33.055
Are you still in love with him?

01:18:34.656 --> 01:18:36.556
Are you going to get
out of bed, Colin?

01:18:36.558 --> 01:18:38.391
Are you going to answer
the question, Lulu?

01:18:38.393 --> 01:18:40.462
No! Because
I'm brushing my hair.

01:18:46.702 --> 01:18:48.768
Mr. Rodney Luff Linn.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:52.772
Er, it's actually Rodney Von
Donkensteiger, but Luff Linn will do.

01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:55.542
Mitch Stemp,
events coordinator.

01:18:55.544 --> 01:18:57.511
Nice to meet you, Mitch.

01:18:57.513 --> 01:19:00.480
I just want to let you know
everything is moving along smoothly

01:19:00.482 --> 01:19:05.519
and I would like to lock the set by
2:00 p.m. today, if that's okay.

01:19:05.521 --> 01:19:07.487
If that works for you
and Mr. Luff Linn.

01:19:07.489 --> 01:19:09.154
Yeah, that's fine.

01:19:09.156 --> 01:19:12.459
Um, I just want to confirm...

01:19:12.461 --> 01:19:16.630
that Mr. Luff Linn will enter
from stage left along this line

01:19:16.632 --> 01:19:19.867
and then he will end up in his chair
to the right of your good self.

01:19:19.869 --> 01:19:22.202
Then he'll sort of, like, go...

01:19:22.204 --> 01:19:24.239
No, I get it. You don't
have to explain it. Okay.

01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:28.644
Great.
Great.

01:19:33.382 --> 01:19:35.684
Oh, am I looking forward
to the event.

01:19:40.288 --> 01:19:44.326
It... will... be...
magical.

01:19:53.468 --> 01:19:54.836
Beverly, I want you
to look at me.

01:20:00.408 --> 01:20:04.813
You and I both know why you chose to hold
this event in this shitbox dickhole hotel.

01:20:07.716 --> 01:20:09.883
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

01:20:09.885 --> 01:20:13.422
But I need to tell you
that I love you deeply.

01:20:14.489 --> 01:20:17.357
You're the man of my dreams.

01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:18.694
We can survive whatever this is.

01:20:20.662 --> 01:20:24.833
For tonight,
the event will be magical.

01:20:26.567 --> 01:20:31.807
A magical, magical night with
my magical, magical Beverly.

01:20:36.178 --> 01:20:38.847
And now,
I'm gonna make you some tea...

01:20:40.716 --> 01:20:45.854
and it... will...
be... magical.

01:20:55.262 --> 01:20:56.665
Is that really
what you're wearing?

01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.899
You chose
these clothes for me.

01:20:59.901 --> 01:21:01.768
Well, I think
you should wear a tie.

01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:04.606
You said I looked good.
I don't have a tie.

01:21:07.809 --> 01:21:09.675
Can't you just find
a tie somewhere?

01:21:09.677 --> 01:21:11.577
I think you should
calm down.

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:13.512
I really think we should just
get down there, okay?

01:21:13.514 --> 01:21:14.847
The event doesn't
start for an hour.

01:21:14.849 --> 01:21:16.882
Why does everyone always have to
get so stressed out all the time?

01:21:16.884 --> 01:21:18.550
Because I wanna get
good seats!

01:21:18.552 --> 01:21:20.453
Yeah, I know you want
to get good seats

01:21:20.455 --> 01:21:23.823
because you want to see Mr. Beverly and
his partner with his magical beard

01:21:23.825 --> 01:21:26.493
do whatever they do
in their magical event.

01:21:26.495 --> 01:21:28.327
Yes, I do want to see that.

01:21:28.329 --> 01:21:30.897
What's so magical about
this magical event anyway?

01:21:30.899 --> 01:21:35.603
I don't know. But whatever it is,
it will probably change your life.

01:21:37.405 --> 01:21:39.872
He is by far the most
brilliant man I've ever met.

01:21:39.874 --> 01:21:42.941
Well, that sounds like I've won
the golden ticket, doesn't it?

01:21:42.943 --> 01:21:47.380
To the most spectacular evening
of whatever the fuck this is

01:21:47.382 --> 01:21:51.250
provided to you by the man who
shat all over you in the ocean!

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.585
Sorry. That's the first time

01:21:53.587 --> 01:21:55.855
I've said the words "fuck"
and "shat" in a long time,

01:21:55.857 --> 01:21:56.923
and they're
horrible words!

01:21:56.925 --> 01:21:57.926
Well, good for you.

01:22:00.294 --> 01:22:03.364
I'm going downstairs, and I'm
going to get us front row seats.

01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:23.851
Happy birthday, Lulu.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:28.520
What time is it?

01:22:28.522 --> 01:22:30.522
6:50.

01:22:30.524 --> 01:22:35.427
- Okay, do we all know what we're doing?
- Yes.

01:22:35.429 --> 01:22:40.699
Okay. Then let's fucking do it!
Let's fucking do it!

01:22:40.701 --> 01:22:41.870
Good luck, everyone.

01:22:53.948 --> 01:22:56.649
Good evening. Please
sit wherever you like.

01:22:56.651 --> 01:22:58.317
Ah, good evening,
Miss Lulu.

01:22:58.319 --> 01:23:01.355
I truly hope you enjoy tonight's show.
Thank you.

01:23:34.989 --> 01:23:37.458
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:38.492 --> 01:23:40.458
Good evening.

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:43.732
My name's Kennedy Gordon. I'm the
manager of the Moorhouse Hotel.

01:23:48.803 --> 01:23:51.570
Well, after some delays,

01:23:51.572 --> 01:23:55.743
I'm beyond thrilled to be standing
here introducing this evening's event.

01:23:57.878 --> 01:24:02.147
For many of us this will be
a once-in-a-lifetime experience,

01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:07.588
so please, let's just
meditate on every moment.

01:24:09.958 --> 01:24:11.092
Okay.

01:24:12.726 --> 01:24:20.666

When I first moved
to Aberdeen,

01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:21.013
this next piece
became my shepherd.

01:27:21.015 --> 01:27:25.986
It guided me away from the shame
that had trotted up inside me.

01:27:28.355 --> 01:27:31.923
I'm sure a lot of you
felt the same way I did

01:27:31.925 --> 01:27:35.295
on those misty moors
of Aberdeenshire.

01:27:37.297 --> 01:27:40.698
This next song is
about the ocean

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.168
and what it means
to be alone.

01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:46.740
Specifically in Aberdeenshire.

My real name is Edmund Summers.

01:29:22.169 --> 01:29:24.104
I loved someone once.

01:29:27.807 --> 01:29:30.743
I loved her
with every waking moment,

01:29:34.247 --> 01:29:36.115
and then I left her.

01:29:41.821 --> 01:29:47.161
I have a great friend
who loves me very much.

01:29:48.761 --> 01:29:50.264
He's up on the stage
with me tonight.

01:29:56.302 --> 01:30:00.139
Rodney,
you're my best friend.

01:30:01.841 --> 01:30:04.777
You look after me,
you care for me.

01:30:07.014 --> 01:30:08.382
And I do love you, Rodney.

01:30:13.853 --> 01:30:15.888
But I'm not in love
with you, Rodney.

01:30:22.361 --> 01:30:24.463
I left my love
with someone else,

01:30:28.968 --> 01:30:31.071
and I don't know
if she'll ever have me back.

01:30:32.372 --> 01:30:33.973
She's the reason I'm here.

01:30:37.211 --> 01:30:38.945
Happy birthday, Lulu.

01:30:44.116 --> 01:30:46.417
I'd like to dedicate
this next song to you.

01:30:46.419 --> 01:30:48.986
It's called,

01:30:48.988 --> 01:30:53.226
"Mmmm mmm!"

01:31:05.838 --> 01:31:07.438
Wait a second!

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.477
That's my wife!

01:31:13.546 --> 01:31:14.813
And it's her birthday!

01:31:16.148 --> 01:31:18.284
And I want to give her
a fucking cake.

01:31:27.461 --> 01:31:28.761
Happy birthday, sweetie.

01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:34.233
I've had enough of this shit.
We're in the middle of a show.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.208
Chipmunk!

01:32:05.498 --> 01:32:07.399
Fucking cunts!

01:32:07.401 --> 01:32:10.136
Hmmm.

01:32:11.505 --> 01:32:12.870
That's it?

01:32:12.872 --> 01:32:14.538
Lulu.

01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.240
What was that
all about?

01:32:16.242 --> 01:32:18.075
"I don't know if
she'll ever have me back."

01:32:18.077 --> 01:32:19.812
I meant what I said.

01:32:22.048 --> 01:32:25.049
I think I did.
Maybe I got carried away.

01:32:25.051 --> 01:32:28.352
I get so anxious before
these shows I can't speak.

01:32:28.354 --> 01:32:30.255
All I say is "mmm."

01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:32.526
My stomach hurts.
I get gas.

01:32:34.093 --> 01:32:37.461
Well, we all get gas,
and then I go up there

01:32:37.463 --> 01:32:40.032
and sometimes I can't remember
a word I say up on that stage.

01:32:41.233 --> 01:32:42.900
So, you didn't mean it?

01:32:42.902 --> 01:32:45.135
I don't know
what I mean anymore.

01:32:45.137 --> 01:32:49.007
In fact, in this precise moment, I don't
really know exactly who on earth I am.

01:32:53.244 --> 01:32:57.147
But what about all the
love you left with me?

01:32:57.149 --> 01:33:01.921
Mmm. You see? You see?
I'm doing it again.

01:33:06.225 --> 01:33:08.127
Why did you
leave me there alone?

01:33:10.929 --> 01:33:13.499
When I swam past the point,
and I saw that ocean,

01:33:14.933 --> 01:33:17.100
I knew I had to keep swimming.

01:33:17.102 --> 01:33:19.537
I knew it was the time.

01:33:19.539 --> 01:33:23.540
I know it sounds corny, but
something was calling me out there.

01:33:23.542 --> 01:33:25.077
I had to keep swimming.

01:33:27.346 --> 01:33:30.116
But where did you go? I
swam around the corner.

01:33:31.617 --> 01:33:34.718
- I hid behind a rock.
- What?

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.590
Then that guy Cornelius...
Remember him from the hotel?

01:33:39.023 --> 01:33:42.058
Yes.
Well, he was in on it.

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:43.362
He got me off the island.

01:33:44.597 --> 01:33:46.630
I think I paid him
80 bucks to help me.

01:33:46.632 --> 01:33:48.267
You big witch!

01:33:50.169 --> 01:33:52.269
Who is this guy?

01:33:52.271 --> 01:33:54.405
You're a big witch.

01:33:54.407 --> 01:33:57.241
Are you just gonna poo on her
again like you did last time?

01:33:57.243 --> 01:33:59.275
Colin,
stay out of this!

01:33:59.277 --> 01:34:01.210
No, I will not
stay out of this.

01:34:01.212 --> 01:34:06.048
I've had to put up with Beverly Luff Linn
and his shit event for the past week

01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:09.453
because the woman I am in love
with is in love with him.

01:34:09.455 --> 01:34:12.124
So, no, I will not
stay out of this.

01:34:15.628 --> 01:34:18.695
You have no idea, Edmund,
how lucky you are

01:34:18.697 --> 01:34:22.668
to even have the possibility
of loving this special woman.

01:34:26.572 --> 01:34:28.273
Oh,

01:34:30.408 --> 01:34:32.545
I know all too well
how special she is.

Do you know what it feels like
when you simply don't belong?

01:35:26.599 --> 01:35:27.466
Yes.

01:35:38.743 --> 01:35:40.278
Edmund, wait!

01:36:35.133 --> 01:36:38.334
Someone drinking
a Rum and a Ramble?

01:36:38.336 --> 01:36:41.172
Um, well, let's see.
Yeah, it would appear so.

01:36:43.575 --> 01:36:44.542
And how is it?

01:36:46.177 --> 01:36:48.279
As creamy and delicious
as the last time.

01:36:50.548 --> 01:36:52.150
Can I join you?

01:36:59.625 --> 01:37:02.325
Captain, I'll have two
A Rumble in the Heather.

01:37:02.327 --> 01:37:03.827
Absolutely, Miss Lulu.

01:37:03.829 --> 01:37:06.164
And two more Rum and Rambles
for me, thanks, Captain.

01:37:07.532 --> 01:37:10.268
Going out with a bang
at the Moorhouse Hotel?

01:37:11.302 --> 01:37:13.571
I'm driving out in the morning.

01:37:16.441 --> 01:37:18.173
Where are you going?

01:37:18.175 --> 01:37:21.177
Colin would rather that
remain top secret, thank you.

01:37:21.179 --> 01:37:23.114
But Lulu would like
Colin to tell her.

01:37:24.617 --> 01:37:26.719
You don't have access
to that information.

01:37:34.325 --> 01:37:38.196
You should know...
that Edmund was my first love.

01:37:44.436 --> 01:37:46.304
You can have other loves.

01:37:51.744 --> 01:37:57.947
Two Rumbles in the Heather and
two large Rum and a Ramble.

01:38:19.004 --> 01:38:20.371
I love this song.

01:38:23.007 --> 01:38:24.375
Don't you love this song?

01:38:25.743 --> 01:38:26.778
I'm not familiar
with it.

01:38:27.879 --> 01:38:28.913

Every girl needs a Colin,
Colin.

01:41:15.913 --> 01:41:16.880
Be right back.

01:41:25.857 --> 01:41:28.826
Now, Colin.
Now's the time.

01:42:15.773 --> 01:42:17.607
I love you,
Colin.

01:42:23.047 --> 01:42:24.015
What did you say?

01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:29.786
I think I said I love you.

01:42:34.859 --> 01:42:36.060
I love you too, Lulu.

01:43:33.317 --> 01:43:35.950
I'll tell you something, Bev.

01:43:35.952 --> 01:43:40.054
This young pup'll be very keen to
get away from the shitpick dickhole

01:43:40.056 --> 01:43:42.093
that was the Moorhouse Hotel.

01:43:43.227 --> 01:43:44.195
There's your nibbles.

01:43:45.963 --> 01:43:47.264
Nibbles, Bev.

01:43:49.867 --> 01:43:51.102
Bev, nibbles.

Oh, my...

01:44:26.102 --> 01:44:29.904
Good God, Bev. You scared
the hell out of me.

01:44:29.906 --> 01:44:31.042
We all thought
you'd died!

01:44:35.946 --> 01:44:37.314
Hmmm!

01:44:38.315 --> 01:44:39.783
