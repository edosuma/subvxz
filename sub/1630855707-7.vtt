00:53.679 --> 00:54.721
Morning.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.266
Coffee is over on the stove.

00:59.893 --> 01:00.936
Early riser, huh?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.272
Only since the world went to hell.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.238
You want to take a look at this?

01:11.989 --> 01:14.074
It's coordinates for everyone
that's gone missing?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.618
Taken. Martin said they "took" Lisa. Here.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.954
I was lying awake when it hit me.

01:18.954 --> 01:23.876
If that kid of yours saw the Williamses'
scarecrow before Felix got taken,

01:23.876 --> 01:26.378
he must have seen things
at the other pickup points, right?

01:26.378 --> 01:30.299
This corner, where Edna Reynolds
was last seen, there's a fire hydrant.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.844
Some joker painted a face on the hydrant.
Maybe he saw that face.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.722
The beauty parlor,
where Dolores Kim was last seen.

01:36.722 --> 01:40.475
The sign is shaped like scissors.
Maybe he drew that sign.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.977
Or maybe it's the coordinates.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.437
The numbers.

01:43.437 --> 01:47.399
Maybe they're in one of these drawings,
like Sheriff Tyson's badge.

01:47.983 --> 01:51.445
I've been going over every picture,
every line, every word, every number.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.656
- It's gotta be in here.
- Or maybe you should take a break.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.366
I'll take a break when I'm done.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.793
- I sound--
- Intense?

02:06.793 --> 02:07.961
I--

02:08.753 --> 02:12.216
- I was gonna say, "Like you."
- Ouch.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.639
I've been thinking a lot
about how you must feel,

02:18.639 --> 02:21.141
walking around town
where everybody's missing.

02:21.141 --> 02:25.812
But you kept your cool until last night
when one of them came back.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
And now...

02:35.948 --> 02:39.117
You're not looking for everybody, are you?

02:41.203 --> 02:42.496
You're looking for somebody.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.459
Is it Billy?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.879
What?

02:50.879 --> 02:51.964
I know this number.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.721
It's a plate. A license plate.
Belonged to Ben Shelton.

03:00.681 --> 03:06.270
His nephews, Cal and Chet, took his truck
one day and then they disappeared here.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.896
They were the first two to go missing.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.649
Sheriff Tyson found the truck
but not the boys,

03:10.649 --> 03:12.943
and then he disappeared
in the same location.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.945
Then Shelton and his wife vanished too.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.864
Right here.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.707
Spirals.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.673
What if...

03:35.799 --> 03:37.342
they're thinking...

03:38.969 --> 03:40.137
moving...

03:43.265 --> 03:44.308
in a spiral?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.187
What's at the center here?

03:50.022 --> 03:51.398
That's Ben Shelton's farm.

03:56.987 --> 04:02.117
After Ben disappeared, the farm sat
empty till the military took it over.

04:02.117 --> 04:05.078
They turned it into a supply depot
to keep food and such.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.586
I don't think that's all they're keeping.

04:16.714 --> 04:17.716
Come on.

04:37.236 --> 04:40.322
All these troops, TAC and cover formation.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.157
I mean, come on now.
What are they guarding?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.244
There's no way they're guarding food.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.875
They're definitely hiding something.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.378
Hey, come on.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.566
We gotta get a better view.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.557
What the hell is down there?

05:53.896 --> 05:56.064
- We got a spike.
- All right. It's active.

05:56.565 --> 05:57.941
Gear up.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.785
Retrieval unit, get in position.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.048
We got one. Haul him up!

06:35.729 --> 06:36.897
Sarge, over there!

06:37.564 --> 06:39.775
Intruders! Twelve o'clock!

06:49.660 --> 06:52.746
- Shit. Let's go! Go! Keep going. Go!
- Wait!

06:52.746 --> 06:54.248
Shit.

06:55.374 --> 06:59.419
Don't move! Put your hands up.
Put your hands up.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.130
All right, easy.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.186
Yo, Casp. What is this weird place?

08:42.313 --> 08:44.024
I think this is where they kept me.

08:44.608 --> 08:45.692
What, you don't know?

08:46.902 --> 08:49.363
These don't look like the kind of reports
my mum used to handle.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.574
I mean, it's all in French. So, who knows?

08:53.742 --> 08:56.870
Whatever they did here,
looks like it didn't save them.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.165
Except you, mate.
You came through all right.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.961
What happened, Casp?

09:04.545 --> 09:08.674
I'm not sure.
I don't really even remember waking up.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.344
This was mine.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.393
Lucky you weren't here
when they broke in, innit?

09:20.769 --> 09:23.063
What about them? Were they here?

09:27.734 --> 09:28.735
Who are they?

09:28.735 --> 09:30.571
Oh, wait. You drew this, right?

09:33.448 --> 09:34.825
Yeah, I must have.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.535
But I don't remember it.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.708
Not sure I've even seen them.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.793
How did you draw them
if you haven't seen them?

09:44.793 --> 09:49.506
Eva, Elkin, Natori. Ringing any bells?

09:49.506 --> 09:50.674
They're--

09:50.674 --> 09:53.427
<i>Les enfants exceptionnels</i>.
They're all here.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.887
Even you, Caspar.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.182
They were patients
here in this ward with you.

09:58.849 --> 10:02.019
Sounds like more than patients.
I mean, "Exceptional Children"?

10:02.019 --> 10:05.022
- Look at this place. They were lab rats.
- But for what, though?

10:05.022 --> 10:07.482
- What did they test them for?
- Who knows?

10:08.483 --> 10:09.693
Not him.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.862
This is all part of the WDC.

10:11.862 --> 10:15.115
Then it's military. So each of these kids...

10:15.115 --> 10:16.200
You...

10:17.117 --> 10:18.118
could be a weapon.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.704
- We don't know that.
- But makes sense, though, right?

10:20.704 --> 10:23.707
I mean, why else would they be locked
down here if they weren't dangerous?

10:23.707 --> 10:26.418
That's... That's actually a good question.

10:27.836 --> 10:32.633
Casp, in my dreams you said you were gonna
find out how to beat them, the aliens.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.551
Did you?

10:36.595 --> 10:39.181
The others. The kids,
I think they might be the key.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.642
- For real?
- I've been feeling them.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.269
Hearing them.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.320
Even when I was out.
Only I didn't know it was them.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.990
At first, I thought it was you, Jam.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.289
But they were speaking
different languages. They still are.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.878
They're just quieter now.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.297
It's like they're far off.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.218
Calling.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.472
I don't know why we're like this.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.599
Connected.

11:24.268 --> 11:28.063
But maybe--
Maybe we can use it to fight back.

11:28.564 --> 11:29.731
Well, let's find them then.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.276
Yeah, Casp. Where are they?
In Paris somewhere?

11:32.276 --> 11:33.986
- Further, I think.
- I'm sorry.

11:34.862 --> 11:38.323
I thought Caspar was the key. Now
we're saying these other kids are the key.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.492
And he doesn't even remember meeting them.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.662
Oh, no. But, no, don't worry, you know,
because he hears them in his head,

11:43.662 --> 11:46.248
even though his GPS
ain't exactly state-of-the-art.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.335
Any of this seem mental to you?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.129
- Come on, Monty. No need--
- No, Alf.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.839
I get it.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.217
It's a bit mad,
but this whole trip's been mad.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.803
And every mad thing has led us here.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.139
To Caspar.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.351
If he says that these kids can help
win the war, let's find them.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.273
- Come on, what have we got to lose?
- We don't even know where to start.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.858
What about this?

12:12.858 --> 12:15.319
There's a lab near OrlÃ©ans.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.988
Or they were making one.
Does that sound right, Casp?

12:19.573 --> 12:20.908
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.953
If I listen,
then we can follow their voices.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.831
- Good enough for me. Let's go.
- I'm in too.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.333
Yeah, sure. Why not?

12:29.333 --> 12:32.669
Like you said, nothing to lose, yeah?
Other than our bloody lives.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.469
There it is. Camp Pierce.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.887
So, what do you think?

12:50.103 --> 12:51.855
We're gonna get your daughter back.

12:55.817 --> 12:56.944
We'll find a way in.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.408
<i>Pretty steep climb,
don't you think, Clark?</i>

13:03.408 --> 13:05.661
Assuming we make it through the gate.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.956
It's gotta be at least 50 armed troops
down there, judging by the barracks.

13:08.956 --> 13:12.751
Before we make any assumptions,
give us a day to watch the base.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.379
Gather what facts we can.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.631
Clark, we've been going nonstop.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.092
Look at us.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.470
We started with 40. We're down to 12.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.640
- We lost Jack, for God's sake.
- Fourteen.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.394
Luke and I makes 14.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.688
I'm talking people
who can actually do something.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.147
I'm cleaning your gun, Hanley.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.693
Okay, now. People are welcome
to voice their concerns.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.070
Anybody else?

13:40.070 --> 13:43.156
No offense, but how many more
of us are we willing to lose?

13:43.949 --> 13:44.950
All to get one back?

13:45.993 --> 13:46.994
One?

13:47.578 --> 13:49.246
She's not "one," she's Sarah.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.539
You know what I mean.

13:51.290 --> 13:54.877
Names are important. Without them,
people are a lot easier to forget.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.879
I'll tell you what I'm not forgetting.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.174
That he's the one
who led them right to us.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.843
- No, we don't know that.
- He hears them in his head.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.512
- You think that's not a two-way street?
- It's not like that.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.389
He saved our lives back in the fog.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.517
- He stopped that alien in its tracks.
- Just by telling it to.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.394
- What else has he been telling them?
- Back off.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.688
- Why? You afraid we might find the truth?
- I said, back off!

14:14.688 --> 14:17.065
Everybody, just... take a breath.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.443
You were keeping things from us.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.447
That alien object thing?

14:25.240 --> 14:26.241
You?

14:26.825 --> 14:29.203
Of all people. Really?

14:31.079 --> 14:34.416
Okay, fine. Fine. Go. Leave.

14:35.417 --> 14:39.004
I don't need this. I'll do it myself.

14:44.051 --> 14:47.221
You're wrong, you know? You do need them.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.390
You're gonna need them down there.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.684
Stay.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.063
Talk to them.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.981
I tried talking to them.

14:58.524 --> 15:01.276
No. Not as soldiers. As people.

15:02.528 --> 15:05.364
Scared people, risking their lives.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.658
Show them who you are.

15:26.260 --> 15:31.181
In med school, I spent a week
shadowing a doctor in the cancer ward.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.562
I watched people find out that death
was living inside their bodies--

15:36.562 --> 15:39.106
- Where is this going?
- You've got somewhere to be?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.028
I'd forgotten about that.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.991
Or just pushed it down.

15:48.991 --> 15:52.119
Pushed it away like so much else.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.751
The doctor, he said something to me
at the end of that week.

16:01.211 --> 16:05.424
He said, "The ones who have
the best chance of survival

16:06.800 --> 16:10.554
are the ones who are willing to fight
for something more than themselves."

16:12.598 --> 16:17.269
Maybe it's their families,
their loved ones, but something.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.814
Something bigger than survival.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.818
And I forgot.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.572
Until I met you guys.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.825
Until I saw you fighting.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.744
Risking your lives.

16:34.745 --> 16:35.954
Giving your lives...

16:38.457 --> 16:40.000
for something more.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.506
I'm sorry you lost loved ones
looking for mine.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.176
Pain like that is...

16:53.931 --> 16:58.852
But if you want to stop, push it away,
I understand.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.562
Believe me.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.775
That's what I would have done
before I met you.

17:05.858 --> 17:06.859
All of you.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.515
- Hey!
- It's me.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.016
They're running air recon. Come here.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.604
Hold this. Got it off that sergeant.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.815
Well, if I wasn't a fugitive before...

17:47.234 --> 17:48.235
Not your first rodeo?

17:48.944 --> 17:51.280
People who actually go to rodeos
don't say that.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.199
- We gotta go!
- Not yet, not yet. Come on.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.409
It's here somewhere.

17:55.409 --> 17:56.910
What did we see back there?

17:56.910 --> 17:59.496
That hole. That blue light.
It's almost like it was alive.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.665
'Cause there's something down there.
Something sent by them.

18:01.665 --> 18:04.251
And the military doesn't want anybody
to find out what it is.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.628
I knew they were lying to us,
pretending to keep us safe.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.922
That boy, Caspar,
you think he saw something?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.465
He didn't just see something.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.220
He saw it.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.851
What the hell is happening at Ben's farm?

18:21.602 --> 18:23.020
I don't know.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.398
But we need to find out.
Come on, let's go.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.108
I know some place safe.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.961
It must have been
some kind of evacuation point.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.546
It's wide open.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.276
It's clear. Let's go.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.409
Okay. Spill it.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.453
What?

19:21.453 --> 19:25.249
You clearly have something to say.
So say it before your brain overheats.

19:28.377 --> 19:29.628
I figured you'd be happy.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.216
Like the rest of us. I mean,
after everything we've been through.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.677
Now we've finally found Caspar.

19:37.803 --> 19:38.804
Did we?

19:39.930 --> 19:43.267
I mean, how was he the only one
who survived in that hospital?

19:43.892 --> 19:46.228
- The only one left.
- Or left behind.

19:46.812 --> 19:48.355
Yeah, either way. Why?

19:49.898 --> 19:54.111
Look, in my own, I guess, shitty way,
I've known him as well as any of you.

19:54.111 --> 19:56.738
I looked in his eyes.
I saw the fear I caused.

19:56.738 --> 19:57.823
And the pain.

19:57.823 --> 20:01.076
And yeah, I got off on it.
But the point is, I saw him.

20:01.827 --> 20:07.624
Now I look at him and I see--
I don't know, I see nothing. Like a void.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.586
Tell me you don't see that too.

20:11.795 --> 20:15.591
Listen. Caspar's dreams brought us to him.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.927
So I'm gonna trust his dreams
wherever they lead.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.349
Can you do that? Trust him?

20:26.977 --> 20:27.978
I trust you.

20:29.146 --> 20:31.023
Your dreams are the ones I'll follow.

20:33.150 --> 20:36.695
<i>...attacks of the newer,
more lethal aliens continue their spread.</i>

20:36.695 --> 20:39.948
<i>From the Pacific Northwest
toward the Rocky Mountain region.</i>

20:39.948 --> 20:41.408
<i>With sightings on the rise...</i>

20:42.326 --> 20:44.411
- What's wrong, girl?
- <i>Ammonia levels...</i>

20:45.078 --> 20:46.246
<i>in these areas,</i>

20:46.246 --> 20:49.833
<i>and the increased number of attacks
has forced communities to evacuate,</i>

20:49.833 --> 20:52.044
<i>sometimes over treacherous terrain.</i>

20:56.173 --> 20:59.468
<i>...military and humanitarian aid
is spreading to create a...</i>

20:59.468 --> 21:00.677
Evening, Marlene.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.138
<i>...serious situation is developing...</i>

21:04.932 --> 21:05.933
There.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.061
Now the hospitality part's over with.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.189
Why is a pair of fugitives in my house?

21:12.189 --> 21:15.192
And keep your voices down.
I just got the twins off to bed.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.653
I know this is--

21:19.112 --> 21:20.697
I just-- I know.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.116
And believe me,
if we had anywhere else to go, we would--

21:23.116 --> 21:24.618
Are you dangerous?

21:25.202 --> 21:26.203
Is he?

21:26.203 --> 21:27.663
No. God, no.

21:27.663 --> 21:29.498
'Cause they're saying you are.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.667
Ma'am, I promise you, we're--

21:31.667 --> 21:34.253
I'm sorry, this is a family conversation.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.675
We are family, still?

21:41.426 --> 21:42.511
I mean, legally?

21:48.433 --> 21:49.852
Well, there's that at least.

21:50.561 --> 21:54.815
Marlene, you're taking a risk
even talking to us.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.942
I can't tell you what that means to me.

21:56.942 --> 21:58.819
But it's gonna be worth it.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.697
To find Billy.

22:07.619 --> 22:08.620
You...

22:10.205 --> 22:12.541
You know what happened to Billy?
You know where he is?

22:12.541 --> 22:16.587
We have a lead, a real one.
We just need a little time.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.339
Can you give it to us?

22:20.924 --> 22:22.885
It ain't pretty
but it'll do for the night.

22:22.885 --> 22:25.179
- Thank you.
- You got it till sunup.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.355
God.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.568
So, you wanna talk about it?

22:43.197 --> 22:44.198
You mean Billy?

22:44.198 --> 22:47.826
Yeah. Who is he?
Like, her husband or something?

22:49.620 --> 22:51.163
Nope, he's mine.

22:56.168 --> 22:58.128
Can we just sit down?

23:12.017 --> 23:14.937
Billy wasn't a bad man. Isn't.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.564
Didn't lie, didn't cheat.

23:18.941 --> 23:22.027
But we hit a rough patch,
and it never smoothed out.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.323
Talking led to fighting, and...

23:27.574 --> 23:29.159
So, we just stopped talking.

23:30.702 --> 23:31.703
For months.

23:33.205 --> 23:38.043
Then, one day he said he wanted a baby.

23:40.754 --> 23:45.717
And I said, "That's funny.
I want a divorce."

23:49.263 --> 23:50.973
Guess it wasn't really that funny.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.940
He came here to stay with Marlene,
his big sister.

24:02.943 --> 24:06.488
Two days later, Sheriff Tyson vanished
and the aliens came.

24:07.865 --> 24:10.701
And then others vanished
and the military came.

24:11.535 --> 24:12.786
And then, Billy vanished.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.164
Then you came.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.043
I wanted him gone.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.589
But not like this.

24:25.424 --> 24:28.844
It feels like it's all my fault.

24:44.443 --> 24:45.903
My son was sick.

24:52.576 --> 24:54.494
His little body was hurting, you know?

24:57.915 --> 24:58.916
So much.

25:04.630 --> 25:07.132
And for a moment
I just wanted the pain to go away.

25:10.052 --> 25:14.348
All the pain, inside all of us. Just...

25:17.059 --> 25:18.060
stop.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.191
And then...

25:27.152 --> 25:29.571
the doctor came in
and broke the news, you know?

25:35.994 --> 25:38.830
It really shakes you up,
losing someone like that.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.214
Does it ever stop?

25:51.844 --> 25:52.845
I'll let you know.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.181
I'll let you know.

26:27.296 --> 26:28.297
Come on.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.427
This bloody rain,
right as we're leaving town.

26:34.428 --> 26:36.972
- It's just like home.
- This is nothing like home.

26:37.598 --> 26:38.724
Let's get supplies, yeah?

26:39.433 --> 26:40.809
Oi, look here.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.773
Oh, yeah! Re-up time!

26:51.612 --> 26:53.488
Never mind the rain,
I'll be drowning in plastic.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.532
All they've got left is extra-large.
We'll have to make do, yeah?

26:55.532 --> 26:57.826
<i>We're receiving word
of alien attacks spreading...</i>

26:57.826 --> 26:59.244
What about this instead?

26:59.244 --> 27:01.872
- That's trash, Pen. Now go put it down.
- What? No.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.624
See? Tags. Brand-new.

27:03.624 --> 27:05.000
Does it even work?

27:05.626 --> 27:06.877
I'll make it work.

27:06.877 --> 27:10.214
- All right, give it to me now. Okay?
- No. You'll just throw it in the bin.

27:10.214 --> 27:11.381
- Pen, give it to me now.
- No!

27:11.381 --> 27:12.799
- Pen, let go of it now!
- No!

27:16.887 --> 27:18.055
It's okay.

27:18.055 --> 27:19.681
- Was that them?
- 'Course it's them.

27:19.681 --> 27:22.976
Casp, can you feel them? Like before,
in Mum's hospital. Are they close?

27:22.976 --> 27:25.437
Come on, I thought you were connected
to them or whatever.

27:25.437 --> 27:26.563
I don't feel anything.

27:27.272 --> 27:30.067
That's good, right?
Maybe they've moved on.

27:31.985 --> 27:33.779
Shit! That one was close!

27:33.779 --> 27:35.864
Sounds like
they're breaking into buildings.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.407
No. No, no, no.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.160
Hey. You're okay. You're okay, Pen.
Take my hands.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.578
Okay, Pen. You're okay.

27:42.412 --> 27:44.665
They smash in here, yeah?
We're sitting ducks.

27:45.207 --> 27:46.416
Time to Jedi up, Skywalker.

27:47.209 --> 27:50.045
Monty's right. We can't stay here.
Come on.

27:55.217 --> 27:56.218
Fuck!

27:57.386 --> 28:01.181
Casp? Can you give us a direction?
Tell us which way is safe?

28:08.772 --> 28:10.065
This way.

28:10.858 --> 28:12.234
Fine, let's go.

28:12.234 --> 28:13.318
Caspar, you lead.

28:35.215 --> 28:37.217
Go! Go!

28:38.468 --> 28:39.469
Run!

28:40.721 --> 28:42.973
Oh, shit! It's a dead end! Fuck!

28:43.682 --> 28:44.766
Guys, what do we do?

28:45.559 --> 28:46.977
Guys, this way!

28:49.229 --> 28:52.065
- They're coming.
- Get it open! Go, go, go.

28:52.065 --> 28:53.150
Go, go, go.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.282
- Hurry!
- Go! Go!

29:00.908 --> 29:02.117
Holy fuck.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.455
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go, Penny. Here you go.

29:07.873 --> 29:09.208
It's a five-story drop!

29:10.334 --> 29:13.045
Oi! What the hell?
You led us straight to them!

29:13.045 --> 29:15.047
Hey, what do we do? What do we do?

29:15.047 --> 29:16.340
Casp?

29:16.340 --> 29:19.510
I'm done listening to him!
He's the reason we're in this mess!

29:19.510 --> 29:22.721
Open. Open! Open it!

29:22.721 --> 29:25.349
Open! Open! Open!

29:25.349 --> 29:30.020
- Open up! Open! Open! Open it.
- Penny.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.688
Open. Open.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.234
I hear them! They're coming!

29:35.234 --> 29:37.986
- Open!
- We trusted you, and now we're stuck here!

29:39.071 --> 29:40.155
Okay.

29:40.656 --> 29:43.033
You and me. Left, right, left. We're fine.

29:44.201 --> 29:45.285
We're fine.

29:45.911 --> 29:46.912
No, we're not.

30:15.566 --> 30:16.567
Let's go!

30:39.006 --> 30:41.341
Hey, man. You hear about Camp Allman?

30:41.842 --> 30:43.093
- What?
- Gone.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.347
An entire company
wiped off the grid overnight.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.683
- Shit.
- Hello?

30:54.062 --> 30:56.565
What the hell, kid? You lost?

30:57.357 --> 30:58.358
I need help.

31:00.611 --> 31:02.446
Where's your family? They all right?

31:03.071 --> 31:05.699
It's not them. It's me.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.620
There's something wrong with me.

31:12.789 --> 31:13.790
I'll call it in.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.793
You sick or something?

31:18.962 --> 31:20.714
You don't look too bad.

31:20.714 --> 31:22.799
How about I take you inside
to the infirmary?

31:22.799 --> 31:24.259
Get the medic to check you out.

31:24.259 --> 31:25.511
You good with that?

31:26.678 --> 31:28.972
You should get them
to check out your friend first.

31:38.273 --> 31:39.274
Clear.

31:44.863 --> 31:47.115
You did your mother proud.
Go. Open the gate.

32:04.883 --> 32:07.803
You better be right about this, Clark.
She's headed into a hornet's nest.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.809
- Watch out!
- Oh, shit!

32:17.896 --> 32:19.690
- Go!
- This way! Follow me!

32:22.901 --> 32:26.488
Out of the truck! On the ground! Now!

32:28.740 --> 32:31.118
I said, get on the ground. Now!

32:31.118 --> 32:32.202
Easy.

32:34.371 --> 32:35.747
Check her.

32:40.210 --> 32:42.713
Damn it. It's bad enough we got an enemy
that isn't even human.

32:42.713 --> 32:45.007
We've gotta worry about humans
becoming our enemies?

32:45.007 --> 32:46.675
- Clear.
- All right, you care to tell me

32:46.675 --> 32:48.844
what the hell you think you're doing?

32:50.470 --> 32:52.347
Gathering you all to a central location.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.892
You're surrounded! Put your guns down!

32:54.892 --> 32:56.435
Drop it, right now!

32:59.897 --> 33:01.899
Put your weapons down! On the ground!

33:01.899 --> 33:05.152
- Down! Down!
- That means you too, Corporal.

33:05.652 --> 33:07.654
Let's make this a day
where no one gets shot.

33:07.654 --> 33:08.906
All right. Easy! Easy!

33:16.663 --> 33:17.664
Move.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.920
- Nice driving.
- Nice counting.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.964
You were right. They're understaffed.

33:26.465 --> 33:28.800
Wanna know how many people
are in an army base?

33:29.635 --> 33:31.470
Keep your eye on the mess hall.

33:34.223 --> 33:35.349
Let's go find her.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.821
What the hell is that?

33:55.118 --> 33:56.954
- Wow. Can't believe it worked.
- I told you.

33:56.954 --> 33:58.872
Everybody's gotta eat. Even the crows.

33:58.872 --> 34:00.415
- Sir, the road's blocked...
- Hey!

34:00.415 --> 34:01.792
Thank Marlene for me.

34:03.669 --> 34:05.754
Not sure she'll wanna see
either of us again.

34:05.754 --> 34:09.091
We'll find Billy. And the rest of them.

34:12.678 --> 34:13.846
Hey, scram!

34:14.888 --> 34:16.889
Hang on to this. Just in case, okay?

34:19.393 --> 34:20.393
You'll make it.

34:21.728 --> 34:23.063
Not your first rodeo.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.330
Let's go, guys! Let's go!

35:25.876 --> 35:26.877
Jamila.

35:28.587 --> 35:29.588
Be careful, yeah?

35:40.098 --> 35:41.266
Hey.

35:44.144 --> 35:46.730
Casp. Mind the can. It's hot.

35:50.526 --> 35:51.527
Cold?

35:52.152 --> 35:53.570
Oh, no. I'm fine.

35:59.243 --> 36:00.744
So much for Paris, eh?

36:01.662 --> 36:03.247
Damn city almost got us killed.

36:05.874 --> 36:07.459
I almost got us killed.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.838
You tried, Casp.

36:12.965 --> 36:15.509
You're still healing or whatever, right?

36:17.177 --> 36:18.303
Still remembering.

36:23.642 --> 36:28.438
I can help you remember. Remember us. No?

36:37.364 --> 36:39.074
I held on to the drawing you made.

36:40.367 --> 36:41.577
All this time.

36:42.953 --> 36:45.497
I used to think
it was so I wouldn't forget you.

36:46.832 --> 36:51.587
But after a while I figured
it was so I wouldn't forget me.

36:53.213 --> 36:56.466
The way you saw me, Casp.

36:58.969 --> 37:00.137
You made me believe.

37:03.015 --> 37:05.726
If you could do that for me,
I can do that for you.

37:06.727 --> 37:07.728
Yeah?

37:11.815 --> 37:13.233
It's all in pieces.

37:14.526 --> 37:20.782
It's like a dream I can't hold on to,
you know? Everything slipping.

37:57.986 --> 38:01.156
It's the first song we
listened to together. Old stuff.

38:24.888 --> 38:27.349
We were on a bus, right?

38:28.392 --> 38:29.393
Yeah.

38:34.481 --> 38:35.482
And I had a book?

38:36.859 --> 38:38.026
Your notebook.

38:38.610 --> 38:40.487
Yeah. It fell open.

38:43.532 --> 38:44.533
Yeah.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.451
And then you...

38:51.790 --> 38:52.791
I remember.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.336
Okay. Sarah Malik.

39:37.336 --> 39:39.505
This tall. Eight-year-old.

39:39.505 --> 39:41.381
Long brown hair. Where is she?

39:47.596 --> 39:50.224
You know, despite what you said out there,
we're not your enemy.

39:50.224 --> 39:53.060
With all due respect, ma'am,
you could've had me fooled.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.146
You're with the Movement, right?

39:56.146 --> 39:58.857
We don't wanna harm anyone.
I hope you can see that.

39:58.857 --> 40:00.943
You gave the two men at the gate concussions.

40:00.943 --> 40:02.277
We just want my daughter.

40:03.195 --> 40:06.031
Hand her over, and we will leave.
We know she's here.

40:11.078 --> 40:12.621
Listen. If you're not the one in charge,

40:12.621 --> 40:14.540
just tell us who is,
and we will talk to them.

40:14.540 --> 40:15.791
No one's in charge.

40:17.835 --> 40:19.753
- Who's the ranking officer?
- I am.

40:21.338 --> 40:24.258
But I was only made corporal by vote.
It's not official.

40:25.133 --> 40:27.928
The rest of the company were transferred
out to fortify other positions.

40:27.928 --> 40:29.388
So no one's running the place?

40:29.388 --> 40:32.683
We're defending our post until
further orders. We're doing our duty.

40:32.683 --> 40:35.519
Which is why I decline your request
for further information.

40:44.778 --> 40:46.113
Decline my request?

40:46.113 --> 40:48.991
All matters concerning
the military actions of this outpost

40:48.991 --> 40:52.411
are considered confidential
and not to be shared with civilians.

40:52.411 --> 40:53.495
Okay.

40:56.039 --> 40:57.332
She is my daughter.

40:58.292 --> 40:59.293
Where is she?

41:04.798 --> 41:06.341
What? There?

41:12.389 --> 41:13.515
Is this where sh--

41:31.700 --> 41:32.784
Help me.

41:35.329 --> 41:36.496
I'm sorry.

41:43.378 --> 41:44.379
Yeah.

41:46.423 --> 41:47.466
Me too.

41:50.802 --> 41:52.638
- Aneesha.
- Jesus, man.

41:52.638 --> 41:53.722
Aneesha!

41:53.722 --> 41:54.973
Hold him down.

41:54.973 --> 41:56.892
- What are you doing?
- Hold him down!

41:58.310 --> 42:00.771
- Keep your gun on him.
- This is not the way to do this.

42:01.313 --> 42:03.941
- Aneesha.
- There you go. Propofol.

42:03.941 --> 42:05.150
What are you doing?

42:05.150 --> 42:08.362
Normally, I would administer 40 milligram.

42:08.362 --> 42:11.031
In your case, let's say 60.

42:11.532 --> 42:13.617
Can you just tell me
what the plan is here?

42:13.617 --> 42:16.411
She was there, Clark. In that room.

42:17.329 --> 42:21.208
Now, I'm going to give him one last chance
to tell me where she is

42:21.208 --> 42:24.169
before I remove something
he's going to miss when he wakes up.

42:24.169 --> 42:26.421
Aneesha, this is--
This is not who you are.

42:26.421 --> 42:29.341
This is exactly who I am! I'm her mother!

42:29.341 --> 42:31.051
Listen. I've lost people too, all right?

42:31.051 --> 42:34.096
I've lost family. I've lost--
Fuck. Please, stop.

42:34.096 --> 42:35.389
Aneesha.

42:35.931 --> 42:37.015
Ma'am, ple--

42:37.015 --> 42:38.600
Now or never.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.019
Please. Listen. Please! Please, just--

42:41.019 --> 42:42.229
- Speak up!
- Goddamn it, please--

42:42.229 --> 42:44.064
- Where is she?
- She's not here!

42:45.607 --> 42:46.817
She's not here.

42:47.317 --> 42:49.361
Searched the admin office and found this.

42:49.361 --> 42:50.696
They left with Sarah last night.

42:51.822 --> 42:53.949
- I'm sorry, Aneesha.
- Oklahoma?

42:53.949 --> 42:56.493
Yeah. It's not a military base.

42:57.369 --> 42:58.620
Project Idabel?

42:59.913 --> 43:01.123
What is this?

43:01.123 --> 43:02.666
It's where we're going next.

43:04.251 --> 43:05.711
Don't worry. We'll find her.

43:06.211 --> 43:07.462
No, you won't.

43:08.005 --> 43:09.715
You're never gonna make it to her.

43:12.009 --> 43:14.386
- We made it to you.
- You don't understand.

43:14.386 --> 43:15.470
Project Idabel,

43:16.221 --> 43:18.390
it's not some half-abandoned way station
like it is here.

43:18.390 --> 43:19.808
That's ground zero.

43:19.808 --> 43:21.560
That's where all of this started.

43:22.644 --> 43:25.856
Listen to me. If they took your daughter
there, then she is gone.

43:26.356 --> 43:27.941
There's nothing you can do.

44:19.284 --> 44:20.786
Let's go. Follow me.

45:24.683 --> 45:25.767
<i>Dear Rose.</i>

45:26.727 --> 45:28.103
<i>This is that note.</i>

45:28.103 --> 45:31.940
<i>The one that says the stuff I couldn't say
when we were laying next to each other,</i>

45:31.940 --> 45:34.109
<i>because I didn't exactly know
how to say it.</i>

45:34.109 --> 45:35.402
<i>I mean, I still don't, but...</i>

45:37.529 --> 45:40.532
<i>Maybe all the things
that brought us together weren't random.</i>

45:41.909 --> 45:43.660
<i>Weren't coincidence.</i>

45:44.453 --> 45:45.579
<i>I needed somebody.</i>

45:47.623 --> 45:50.042
<i>We all need somebody,
even if we don't see it.</i>

45:58.842 --> 46:00.928
<i>The drawings, the visions.</i>

46:00.928 --> 46:04.014
<i>Maybe what's gonna make them come together</i>

46:04.014 --> 46:06.808
<i>like puzzle pieces clicking into place,
is you.</i>

46:06.808 --> 46:07.976
<i>Like a light.</i>

46:08.519 --> 46:09.895
<i>Showing me the way.</i>

46:10.521 --> 46:11.647
Perimeter clear.

46:22.157 --> 46:25.202
<i>Showing me what's
at the center of all of this.</i>

46:32.209 --> 46:33.418
<i>Guiding me home.</i>
