WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.705
CHARLIE:
Where is it? It was right here.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.674
I cannot find it.
And by the way, Mac,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.309
what're you even talking about?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.211
The word is superstition,
not "stupid-stition."

00:10.244 --> 00:12.213
I know what the word is,
Charlie.

00:12.246 --> 00:16.084
I'm saying your green man suit
is a stupid superstition.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.652
Oh, really? Then why
do the Eagles keep winning?

00:18.686 --> 00:19.920
Also, by the way, dude,

00:19.953 --> 00:22.090
uh, you're a Cowboys fan,
so shut the hell up.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.591
I'm not a Cowboy fan,
I'm a Tony Romo fan.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.093
And he retired,
so now I bleed green.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.427
-Go, Birds! Go, Birds!
-All right, well, I'm not

00:26.460 --> 00:28.262
going to the Super Bowl
without it. I got to find it.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.098
Yeah, don't make us late,
Charlie, all right?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.100
I-If you can't find it,
you can't find it, you know?

00:32.133 --> 00:34.368
The-the fans have no effect on
the outcome of the game, anyway.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.204
-Do you know how football works?
-MAC: Yes.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.605
That's right,
your voodoo bullshit

00:37.638 --> 00:38.939
is not gonna mean anything if...

00:38.972 --> 00:40.508
Wh-What's going on
with your eye?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.376
Uh, nothing, I got a,
I think I got an eyelash in it.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.278
Well, you're, like, scratching
it, and it's blinking.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.846
-I just, I slept on it funny.
-(Charlie groans)

00:45.879 --> 00:47.615
What the hell
is the holdup here?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.016
MAC:
Frank, this is why

00:49.049 --> 00:51.385
I wanted total control
over the guest list, all right?

00:51.419 --> 00:53.787
The eyes of the world
are gonna be on Philadelphia,

00:53.821 --> 00:57.358
and I want to show them that we
are not just degenerates, okay?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.628
And that is why I'm very nervous
about these guys.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.563
MEN (chanting):
Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:02.596 --> 01:03.631
Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:03.664 --> 01:04.965
Hey.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.134
Chug! Oh!

01:06.167 --> 01:08.302
Do me a favor,
hold that corner right there.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.471
-What's this?
-Uh, I got to put up a sign.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.040
I want people to know
we're closed for salmonella

01:13.073 --> 01:14.575
because of the Super Bowl.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.644
Okay. First of all,

01:16.677 --> 01:19.380
how is "salmonella" the only
word you spelled correctly?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.315
And second of all, which is it?
Are we closed for salmonella,

01:21.349 --> 01:23.317
or are we closed 'cause of the
Super Bowl? It's very confusing.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.486
-Look, do me a favor? Okay?
Just go find green man.
-Yep.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.322
Please? Please, thank you.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.558
-Charlie. Here,
eat this asparagus.
-What?

01:30.591 --> 01:31.992
No, I can't eat that right now.
That-That's not right.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.227
It's not part of my rituals.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.762
Okay, do you know
what's not right...

01:34.795 --> 01:36.764
is that we are trying
to start a family,

01:36.797 --> 01:38.832
-and you're not taking it
very seriously.
-Okay, no, I hear you,

01:38.866 --> 01:40.568
but what I need
to take seriously right now

01:40.601 --> 01:41.735
is the Super Bowl, okay?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.404
And that means
sticking to my color system.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.606
All right? I wear green.
I don't eat it.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.341
I'm green man. I eat brown,

01:47.375 --> 01:49.743
preferably, uh, milksteak
with a little light char to it.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.445
And I drink yellow,
because beer is yellow,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.514
and that is what has been
working all season long!

01:53.547 --> 01:55.683
-Oh, my God.
-I don't want to talk
about this right now.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.618
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where're you going?
-Huh?

01:57.651 --> 01:58.752
Got to find green man.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.354
-Why does no one
understand this?
-(sighs)

02:00.388 --> 02:02.856
Nobody cares
about your stupid superstitions.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.858
-Dude, just get off my back,
all right? Let me find it.
-No.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.361
Man, look, I just wish one time

02:07.395 --> 02:09.530
you would not make everything
so difficult.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.864
Yeah, and you know what?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.366
Sometimes I wish
you'd just disappear.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.370
Yo, check it out.
I got one last surprise.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.306
("Eye of the Tiger"
by Survivor playing)

02:18.339 --> 02:21.609
(all cheering)

02:21.642 --> 02:23.544
-(whooping)
-This is very nice.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.713
Party bus!

02:25.746 --> 02:27.615
-No way.
-Fully stocked.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.383
(overlapping chatter)

02:29.417 --> 02:31.219
(all cheering)

02:31.252 --> 02:33.221
-There it is!
-You found it!
-MAC: All right.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.223
-You found the damn suit.
Can we go now?
-DEE: Nice.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.425
Where the hell is green man?!

02:39.193 --> 02:40.561
Where is it?!

02:42.430 --> 02:44.732
Well, I just can't find it,
so I'm gonna have to, like,

02:44.765 --> 02:46.066
buy a new one
on the way up there.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.735
Who knows if it's even
gonna have the same powers

02:47.768 --> 02:49.203
as the other one did. I...

02:50.271 --> 02:52.072
Where is everybody?

02:52.105 --> 02:54.107
Guys?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.545
*

03:19.800 --> 03:22.035
Honey?

03:22.069 --> 03:24.472
Hello?

03:25.473 --> 03:27.675
Mac?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.010
Dee?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.045
Frank?

03:34.748 --> 03:37.785
I made my friends disappear.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.590
I made my friends disappear!

03:42.623 --> 03:45.359
* Rockin' around
the Christmas tree *

03:45.393 --> 03:48.562
* At the Christmas party hop *

03:48.596 --> 03:52.032
* Mistletoe hung
where you can see *

03:52.065 --> 03:55.235
* Every couple tries to stop *

03:55.269 --> 03:57.705
* Rockin' around... *

03:57.738 --> 03:59.573
Hey, Frank!

03:59.607 --> 04:03.076
I'm going through your stuff!

04:03.110 --> 04:06.213
* Later we'll have
some pumpkin pie *

04:06.246 --> 04:08.215
* And we'll do some caroling *

04:08.248 --> 04:09.650
Hey, Mac!

04:09.683 --> 04:12.152
I'm going through your stuff!

04:12.185 --> 04:14.388
I got your...

04:14.422 --> 04:16.757
sticky Bible!

04:16.790 --> 04:18.659
Dee!

04:18.692 --> 04:20.761
I'm going through your stuff!

04:20.794 --> 04:22.730
* Deck the halls
with boughs of holly *

04:22.763 --> 04:25.399
Dee, woof!

04:25.433 --> 04:28.802
* The Christmas tree,
have a happy holiday *

04:29.870 --> 04:31.605
* Everyone dancing... *

04:31.639 --> 04:33.641
(screams)

04:36.644 --> 04:39.212
I don't know why I'm screaming.
This doesn't hurt at all.

04:41.315 --> 04:44.284
Countdown to the game.
And start the clock.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.087
E-A-G-L-E-S!

04:47.120 --> 04:49.757
Eagles! All right, boys.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.625
I'm home alone in the bar,
you know?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.927
It's all me.
This is, like, my bar now.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.531
Hey, cheers to you
and the big game, boys, right?

04:57.565 --> 04:58.866
Really cool, too, man.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.034
Those, like, those uniforms
look really cool on you.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.303
You guys look,
like, really strong.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.776
(chuckles):
I am a little bored.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.811
(growling)

05:13.581 --> 05:15.516
What the heck?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.652
Hello?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.622
Hello?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.624
Mac?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.460
Dee?

05:26.494 --> 05:28.462
Frank?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.698
Is this a joke?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.402
Cricket?

05:34.435 --> 05:36.069
Uncle Jack?

05:36.103 --> 05:37.738
-Is this a joke?
-(growling)

05:37.771 --> 05:38.739
(gasps)

05:38.772 --> 05:40.073
(growling continues)

05:40.107 --> 05:41.642
It's only my imagination.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.412
It's only my imagination.
It's only my imagination.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.814
*

05:46.847 --> 05:47.881
(gasps)

05:49.783 --> 05:52.586
(panting)

05:52.620 --> 05:54.187
Okay.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.824
So, he tries to punch me.
He misses.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.759
-Oh.
-He misses. What an idiot, huh?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.260
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

06:00.293 --> 06:01.462
I got it.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.467
(door rattling)

06:07.735 --> 06:09.770
-Hey, idiot.
-What?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.672
Read the sign.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.775
"Closed for salmonella
because Super Bowl."

06:14.808 --> 06:16.444
Well, which one is it?
Is it closed for salmonella,

06:16.477 --> 06:18.446
-or is it closed
for the Super Bowl?
-I don't know.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.180
Burglars.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.382
-(panting)
-(chatter continues outside)

06:22.416 --> 06:23.951
Thi-This is my bar.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.719
(panting)

06:25.753 --> 06:27.320
I have to defend it.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.460
Ah, I know.

06:32.493 --> 06:36.196
* Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock *

06:36.229 --> 06:39.567
* Jingle bells swing
and jingle bells ring *

06:39.600 --> 06:42.069
-* Snowin' and blowin' up *
-(shouts)

06:42.102 --> 06:44.538
* Bushels of fun *

* Now the jingle hop has begun *

06:48.108 --> 06:51.645

in jingle bell time *

* Dancin' and prancin'
in Jingle Bell Square *

* In the frosty air *

07:04.157 --> 07:08.095

it's the right time *

07:08.128 --> 07:10.831
-* To rock the night away *
-(grunting)

07:10.864 --> 07:15.503
* Jingle bell time
is a swell time *

07:15.536 --> 07:19.773

(screaming continues)

07:39.560 --> 07:42.530
(groaning)

07:42.563 --> 07:44.932
Ooh, ooh, that's a gusher.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.700
I got to stop the bleeding.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.936
Help! Help!

07:48.969 --> 07:50.403
(sighs)

07:51.404 --> 07:53.574
Oh, shit.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.611
Uh, okay. Okay.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.387
(pants, shrieks)

08:07.420 --> 08:10.123
Oh, God.
Oh, this is gonna suck.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.225
(panting)

08:12.259 --> 08:14.127
Oh! Shit!

08:14.161 --> 08:15.996

08:16.029 --> 08:17.497
Okay.

It's time for the Super Bowl.
Super Bowl.

Oh, man.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.027
(groans)

08:49.029 --> 08:50.864
-(indistinct, excited chatter)
-What?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.165
-(cheers and applause)
-(horn honking)

08:52.199 --> 08:54.602
How is the game starting? Uh...

08:54.635 --> 08:57.004
How did I lose an entire day?!

08:57.037 --> 08:59.339
Oh, shit,
I got to get the TV on!

08:59.372 --> 09:01.108
(yells)

09:01.141 --> 09:03.276
(crying)

09:03.310 --> 09:05.012
Oh, shit.
Hey, uh, help?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.447
(panting)
Oh, who am I kidding, man?

09:07.480 --> 09:09.883
No one's gonna leave
their TVs right now.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.688
My colors.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.290
I-I didn't do my color rituals.
Guys,

09:17.324 --> 09:19.559
you're gonna lose the game
because of me!

09:19.593 --> 09:21.595
I'm so sorry I let you guy...

09:21.629 --> 09:23.897
I let you guys down, man.
I didn't...

09:23.931 --> 09:26.199
Oh, I blew it.
(crying)

09:26.233 --> 09:28.235
It's gonna be my fault.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.473
(squeaking, sniffing)

09:33.506 --> 09:36.376
Hey. Hey there, fella.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.646
Be careful. Don't-don't...
don't go by the traps.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.648
Don't... Come here,
come here, come here.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.083
Come here, come here,
come here. Come here. I got you.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.985
-You're gonna be okay.
-(squeaking)

09:45.018 --> 09:46.754
'Cause I know what it's like
to be caught in a trap now,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.421
and it's not okay.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.124
I won't let you get caught
in a trap, okay?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.961
You're so cute and tiny and...

09:53.994 --> 09:56.664
and brown.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.869
Healthy-looking fellow, huh?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.482
Ah. The brown is down.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.785
The brown is down.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.452
Wasn't too bad.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.488
-(cheering)
-(horn tooting)

10:21.521 --> 10:23.857
Eagles must have scored.
It's working!

10:23.891 --> 10:26.159
All right. All right,
let's get that TV on.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.527
(laughing)

10:27.560 --> 10:29.462
(laughing maniacally)

10:29.496 --> 10:31.665
I ate my brown, and it worked!

10:31.699 --> 10:33.867
(laughing):
I ate my brown!

10:33.901 --> 10:37.671
(laughing)

10:37.705 --> 10:39.339
Although I got a feeling
that's gonna

10:39.372 --> 10:41.208
come back to haunt me later.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.712
No, right now.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.379
(retching)

10:46.413 --> 10:48.882
(whimpers, groans)

10:48.916 --> 10:51.685
Never, ever, ever, ever,
ever eat a rat.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.221
-* Risin' up... *
-(gasps)

10:54.254 --> 10:56.256
-(people booing, jeering)
-(horns honking)

10:58.591 --> 11:00.728
-(groans)
-(booing and jeering continues)

11:00.761 --> 11:03.230
(groans, mutters)

11:07.768 --> 11:10.303
Oh, man, that sounds
like the Pats scored, huh?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.906
Okay, I-I just got to keep going
with my colors, right?

11:12.940 --> 11:15.242
All right, that's what I'm gonna
do. I'm-I'm gonna keep going.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.077
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna wear green.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.479
I'm gonna drink yellow.
All right.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.248
Green. What's-what's green?
What's green?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.751
What can I...?

11:23.784 --> 11:25.218
Okay, I got it.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.920
Okay, boys, I got it.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.321
Here's the play.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.257
I'm not gonna
let you fellas down.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.726
I'm gonna untie my shoes,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.728
I'm gonna toss them
over the rope.

11:34.762 --> 11:37.597
That's gonna lower
that green paint can down to me.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.767
(groans)

11:39.800 --> 11:41.268
(crying)

11:41.301 --> 11:43.403
(laughing)

11:43.436 --> 11:46.339
(crying)

11:46.373 --> 11:48.776
Shoes goes up.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.944

11:50.978 --> 11:52.946
Aah!
Okay, boys,

11:55.816 --> 11:58.786
Soar like an Eagle! Yeah!

12:08.195 --> 12:10.430
Oh, shit.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.066
Okay, plan B.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.467
(booing, honking in distance)

12:14.501 --> 12:17.204
Oh, no. Okay.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.039
(panting)
Bear with me.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.908
(yells, whimpers)
All right.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.642
Let's chew through this bad boy.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.312
I'm gonna chew through it.
(grunts)

12:27.080 --> 12:29.049
(spits, grunts)

12:29.082 --> 12:31.318
There we go. Okay.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.753
Here we go.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.825
(strained):
Oh, no.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.326
All right.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.994
I'm just gonna have to catch it.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.996
One...
(panting)

12:43.030 --> 12:44.331
two...

12:44.364 --> 12:45.498
three.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.841
(groans)

12:53.874 --> 12:55.275
(coughing)

12:55.308 --> 12:57.110
(groans)

12:57.144 --> 13:00.180
(coughing)

13:00.213 --> 13:01.949
Okay, I'm green.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.617
-(groans) That's...
-(cheering, honking in distance)

13:04.651 --> 13:06.786
Nice. Sounds like it's working.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.121
All right.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.858
Got to get some yellow.
(grunts)

13:10.891 --> 13:13.861
Got to get some yellow!
Got to drink some beers, boys!

13:13.894 --> 13:15.328
(whoops)

13:15.362 --> 13:17.430
(crying)

13:17.464 --> 13:19.032
(grunts)

13:19.066 --> 13:21.001
(coughing)

13:21.034 --> 13:22.936
(laughs)

13:22.970 --> 13:23.937
I'm coming, beer!

13:23.971 --> 13:25.805
I'm gonna get my yellow!

13:26.874 --> 13:29.542
(grunts)

13:31.912 --> 13:35.215
Oh, shit!

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050
(pants)
I'm stuck.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.218
(grunts)

13:38.251 --> 13:42.089
(yelling)

13:43.423 --> 13:45.525
(yells)

13:45.558 --> 13:47.394
(panting)

13:49.897 --> 13:51.764
(grunting)

13:57.437 --> 13:58.605
(grunts)

14:03.610 --> 14:05.578
Oh!

14:05.612 --> 14:08.615
(crying)

14:10.250 --> 14:13.053
(clinking)

14:13.086 --> 14:16.389
(grunting)

14:16.423 --> 14:18.091
(crying)

14:18.125 --> 14:19.559
Not enough yellow!

14:19.592 --> 14:21.061
-(panting)
-(booing in distance)

14:21.094 --> 14:23.396
Where the hell
am I gonna get some yellow?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.501
-(urinates)
-Oh, God.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.271
Oh, God.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.108
Oh, this is awful.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.777
JASON KELCE:
You can do it, Charlie.
You drink that yellow.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.013
You got us here!

14:40.047 --> 14:41.448
Now finish what you started.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.683
Whoa. Hey, dudes.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.452
Finish your color rituals.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.753
Okay. Here goes!

14:46.786 --> 14:49.256
Go, Eagles!

14:49.289 --> 14:50.958
(gulping)

14:50.991 --> 14:53.026
Oh, that was rough.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.194
Now turn on that TV.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.262
Yeah!

14:55.295 --> 14:56.796
Oh!

14:56.829 --> 14:59.466
I don't think
I can get there, boys.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.700
You watched every game
this season-- you can't miss

15:00.733 --> 15:01.969
the end
of the most important one.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.136
Oh, come on, man.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.138
I did the color rituals.
Isn't that enough?

15:05.172 --> 15:06.806
The only reason
the Eagles made it this far

15:06.839 --> 15:08.541
is because
of your superstitions.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.978
The rituals. They say
you're caught in a bear trap.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.812
They say you lost
two quarts of blood.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.114
They say you're hallucinating!

15:14.147 --> 15:15.382
Who's "they"?

15:15.415 --> 15:16.984
Everyone who didn't believe
in you.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.286
And I got two words for them:
fuck 'em!

15:19.319 --> 15:22.122
-Right!
-You've got this, Charlie.
You're an Eagle.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.991
-Yeah!
-Now go turn on that TV!

15:24.024 --> 15:26.960
Yeah! (whoops)
Here I go!

15:26.994 --> 15:28.161
-Yeah, come on, Charlie.
You got this.
-Come on, Charlie.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.730
(muttering, laughs)

15:30.763 --> 15:32.632
(grunting)

15:32.665 --> 15:34.434
-Come on, Charlie. Come on!
-Pull that chain! Pull it!

15:34.467 --> 15:35.902
(Charlie shouts)

15:35.935 --> 15:37.637
-Yeah!
-(laughing)

15:37.670 --> 15:40.473
-Come on, Charlie.
You can do this, baby.
-Let's go.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.475
Oh, glass!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.744
-I stepped right on the glass!
-Yeah,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.246
-but keep pushing, man.
-No pain, no gain!
-(groans)

15:46.279 --> 15:47.780
Okay. I got it.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.185
-Oh!
-Oh!
-(screams)

15:52.219 --> 15:54.187
I forgot about that one!

15:54.221 --> 15:56.023
Why would anybody do that
to anybody?

15:56.056 --> 15:58.091
-Fight through it.
Fight through the pain!
-(mutters)

15:58.125 --> 16:00.427
-Come on, come on.
-Move, move.
-(groaning)

16:00.460 --> 16:02.029
Oh, I forgot...
(yells)

16:02.062 --> 16:04.031
-Oh!
-Shit! (groans)

16:04.064 --> 16:06.333
Come on, man. You got it. You
took that one, eh? Keep going,

16:06.366 --> 16:08.868
-Charlie.
-(straining)

16:08.901 --> 16:10.603
-Come on, Charlie.
-Pull that chain!

16:10.637 --> 16:11.704
-BOTH: Pull that chain!
Pull that chain!
-I am pulling,

16:11.738 --> 16:13.673
you big fat assholes!

16:13.706 --> 16:15.275
-(groans)
-There's some slack in here.
Pull it.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.876
-(crying)
-There you go.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.046
Come on, Charlie.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.048
(strains)
I can't do it!

16:21.081 --> 16:23.050
(groans)
I can't do it.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.518
No, no, it's too hard.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.854
No, the trap.
It was designed for animals.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.222
Yeah. So?

16:29.256 --> 16:31.558
You're a human, dude.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.560
Use your thumbs.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.695
-What do you mean,
use my thumbs?
-There's a release lever

16:35.728 --> 16:37.897
on the bottom. Thumbs.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.033
What?!

16:40.067 --> 16:43.236
Well, why didn't you tell me
there was a release lever?!

16:43.270 --> 16:45.238
You bought the trap, Charlie.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.207
I only know
about the release lever

16:47.240 --> 16:48.908
because you know
about the release lever.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.577
Y-You get that, right?

16:50.610 --> 16:53.913
Yeah, no, I-I totally get that.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.582
-He's not getting it.
-We're-we're not real.
-No, I get it.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.718
Quick question:
where is the release lever?

16:58.751 --> 17:00.520
-It's on the bottom!
-It's on the bottom!

17:00.553 --> 17:01.688
-The bottom of the trap.
-Yeah. You set it up.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.757
I see it. Okay.
(grunts)

17:04.791 --> 17:06.826
-(straining)
-(creaking)

17:06.859 --> 17:07.927
Oh!

17:07.960 --> 17:11.531
(pained laughing)

17:11.564 --> 17:12.865
COMMENTATOR:
Patriots with the ball
at their own

17:12.899 --> 17:14.667
-nine yard line.
-Oh!

17:14.701 --> 17:17.570
Oh, Brady's got the ball.
The ball... What?!

17:17.604 --> 17:19.272
Brady's got the ball
with time on the clock!?

17:19.306 --> 17:21.441
Oh, shit, what happened?
What changed?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.076
Yeah... you're gonna

17:23.110 --> 17:24.444
-have to get back in that trap.
-Yeah.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.680
Aw, come on, man. You
just told me to get out of it.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.949
Yeah, that was before
Brady had the ball.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.951
(groans) Does it have to be
the same leg or...

17:31.984 --> 17:34.187
-Yeah.
-Same leg.
-Damn it!

17:34.221 --> 17:36.189
Are you sure this is gonna work?

17:36.223 --> 17:38.191
Every single thing
that every fan does,

17:38.225 --> 17:41.794
at home or at the stadium, makes
a direct impact in the game.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.397
Aw... shit.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.134
* Fly, Eagles, fly *

17:47.167 --> 17:50.970
-* On the road to victory *
-* Fight, fight, fight *

17:51.003 --> 17:54.141
* Fight, Eagles, fight *

17:54.174 --> 17:56.609

one, two, three *

17:56.643 --> 17:57.977

17:59.479 --> 18:01.281

18:05.152 --> 18:08.288
