00:29.000 --> 00:30.001
Huh?

00:30.840 --> 00:31.841
Hey!

01:46.840 --> 01:49.047
Citizens of Planet Earatavikslu,

01:49.360 --> 01:52.523
your world has been scanned
and compressed into a smaller file

01:52.680 --> 01:54.887
for efficient storage and preservation.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.441
You are welcome.

01:57.360 --> 02:01.968
The largest planet database in the galaxy
is one planet closer to completion.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.762
Finally, every spot on the D
through E shelf will now be full.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.641
Ow!

02:17.960 --> 02:19.007
Argh.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.721
Planet Earatavikslu is now damaged.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.846
My collection can only
assimilate planets in mint condition.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.161
Argh.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.411
Recalculating, recalculating,
recalculating.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.729
Circuit balance restored.

02:35.080 --> 02:40.769
Now, I must calculate an alternative world
that will go between Buzizz and Eberth.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.804
If only there was another planet
that started with E-A.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.646
Searching...

02:49.360 --> 02:50.361
Searching...

02:51.240 --> 02:52.241
Searching...

02:52.920 --> 02:56.447
Ah! Required data file located.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.646
The very planet that Darkseid told me
about in my digital suggestions box,

03:01.840 --> 03:03.410
the planet Earth.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.088
Recalculating...

03:59.480 --> 04:02.848
When Martian Manhunter,
Green Arrow and Batman team up,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.522
criminals like Cheetah and Vandal Savage
don't stand a chance.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.046
And now to meet up with the rest
of the league, the Justice League.

04:17.560 --> 04:21.007
Strange to think that only last year,
I was hesitant to join them,

04:21.519 --> 04:25.206
and now I could not be more proud to be
a member of most dedicated, intrepid

04:25.400 --> 04:28.529
and professional band of heroes,
history has ever known.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.365
Let's see what they are up to.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.050
92, 93, 94...

04:35.200 --> 04:39.250
95, 96, 97, 98...

04:39.520 --> 04:42.091
Flash, I can still hear you
trying to find a hiding spot.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.211
Better hurry!

04:44.720 --> 04:46.529
- 99...
- No.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.207
100!

04:48.480 --> 04:51.051
Ready or not, here I come!

04:54.600 --> 04:57.046
And Green Lantern is behind the armchair.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.844
Hey, no fair! I thought we said that
you couldn't use your superpowers.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.565
X-ray vision much?

05:02.800 --> 05:06.486
I didn't. It was the only piece
of green furniture in the Hall of Justice.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.723
Oh. Right!

05:19.680 --> 05:21.887
Cyborg is in Wonder Woman's invisible jet.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.562
Dang! How does he do it?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.604
Golly, Cyborg. I keep telling you,

05:26.840 --> 05:30.401
Wonder Woman's plane
is invisible except for the person in it.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.890
Really?
Why would that be helpful in any way?

05:40.360 --> 05:41.521
Vic!

05:44.880 --> 05:46.245
I found Wonder Woman!

05:47.360 --> 05:49.283
Aw, I'm sorry, Wonder Woman.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.482
You gave up your hiding space
and lost a game

05:51.680 --> 05:53.603
just to keep me from doing something dumb!

05:54.040 --> 05:55.530
And I know how competitive you are.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.611
Think nothing of it, Cyborg.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.007
On Paradise Island,

05:59.240 --> 06:03.290
we Amazons learn that the wellbeing
of others is always what matters most.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.051
She is so nice.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.168
You couldn't find me!

06:08.440 --> 06:09.965
I hid in the perfect place.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.801
New York?

06:12.040 --> 06:14.042
Argh. How does he do it?

06:15.120 --> 06:16.531
Oh.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.484
Superman, you really are
the best at hide-and-go-seek.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.801
You can find anybody.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.566
Oh, gee. Thanks.

06:24.960 --> 06:29.365
You know when I was in the Scouts as
a kid, they always told me to be prepared.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.885
Oh. Hey, Batman!

06:35.160 --> 06:38.767
We were just, um, honing our skills
of camouflage and, and, and...

06:39.080 --> 06:41.242
Being stealthy, you now, like you!

06:41.720 --> 06:43.165
Instead of performing
your scheduled duties

06:43.440 --> 06:46.450
and monitoring the world for injustice,
you were playing hide-and-go-seek.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.450
Superman was "it" and found
each of you within two minutes.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.530
He really is
the world's greatest detective.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.327
Gee whiz, Bruce, I'm sorry
we didn't invite you to play. We could...

06:55.640 --> 06:58.450
Secret identities
are not to be mentioned while in costume.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.009
As stated
in the Justice League Rule Book, page one.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.161
Our friendly exercise didn't seem like
the kind of thing you'd enjoy, Batman,

07:06.640 --> 07:10.042
not like, uh, fighting crime.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.564
Friendly exercise.
I understand completely.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.400
My dark and mysterious nature
terrifies criminals,

07:16.600 --> 07:19.888
intimidates my enemies,
and discourages friendships.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.447
I'm okay with that.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.210
What? Don't be silly.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.760
Of course you're our friend.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.050
We're all friends.
We're like super friends.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.050
Super best friends!

07:30.320 --> 07:34.291
- Like Jupiter and Poseidon.
- Buddies, amigos.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.766
Uh, let's be honest,

07:35.960 --> 07:39.851
this is the guy whose favorite pastime is
dreaming up ways to defeat each of us,

07:40.040 --> 07:41.565
should we suddenly turn evil.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.084
I bet he is carrying kryptonite
in his back pocket right now.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.561
I don't have back pockets.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.081
And you sure don't have faith
in your colleagues here either.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.842
It's hard to call
a guy like that a friend.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.524
Well, I suppose Batman's not so much
of a "Let's hang out and goof off," friend.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.887
He's more of a "Let's get
things done" friend.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.731
- Right.
- Exactly!

08:03.040 --> 08:04.326
Like, if we were
doing something important,

08:04.560 --> 08:08.405
like fighting crime or painting Wonder
Woman's apartment, we'd totally call you.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.965
No need to explain.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.851
I don't need friends
the Dark Knight walks alone.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.247
Batman...

08:15.560 --> 08:17.085
Cyborg's mobile trouble alert.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.605
The threat appears to be space-based.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.764
Readjust the League's satellite
to coordinates delta 27, grid five.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.961
On it.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.726
There it is. I see something.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.160
Increasing resolution.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.481
Oh, no.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.727
You know what that is?

08:34.080 --> 08:37.721
Yes, I do. And we have to stop it
before it reaches Earth.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.160
To the Javelin.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.484
Prepare for launch. Everyone, buckle in.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.531
Ah, who needs a seat belt?
I can run faster than this bucket.

08:50.720 --> 08:51.721
Three, two, one, blast off.

08:52.560 --> 08:53.561
Whoa!

08:54.240 --> 08:57.806
Everyone, everyone needs
to buckle up, every time.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.001
Okay, I see your point.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.484
Superman, you said you know
what this thing is?

09:04.760 --> 09:05.807
Unfortunately.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.641
That ship belongs to a sentient robot
named Brainiac.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.485
More like dumb-name-iac! Am I right?

09:12.800 --> 09:15.406
I'm high-fiving you for that,
but my heart isn't in it.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.001
Computer, access Kryptonian database
from Superman Baby rocket.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.641
That's the alien rocket that brought you to
Earth as an infant from a doomed planet.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.325
Yes, I know.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.650
Brainiac was designed to be
the ultimate artificial intelligence.

09:29.880 --> 09:33.089
Built to catalog the existing universe
for future generations.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.489
Unfortunately, due to an accident
and a glitch in his programing,

09:36.880 --> 09:40.123
Brainiac now scours the galaxy
looking for planets to capture,

09:40.480 --> 09:43.051
and permanently preserve
in his growing collection.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.523
Oh, I totally get the impulse.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.643
I collect commemorative coffee mugs.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.846
This one is from Niagara Falls,
this one is from the Grand Canyon,

09:52.080 --> 09:55.402
this one is a souvenir coffee mug
from a factory that makes coffee mugs.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.920
Please stop.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.649
I did not come back to Earth
to listen to Flash talk about coffee mugs!

10:01.160 --> 10:03.686
How can Brainiac capture
entire civilizations?

10:03.960 --> 10:06.042
Two words. Shrink ray.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.841
Actually, shrink-ray is a single
hyphenated word, but I'll let that pass.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.521
Whoa, shrink-ray.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.405
That would be a great way
to save storage space!

10:14.600 --> 10:17.046
You could just shrink your Christmas
decorations when you didn't need...

10:17.240 --> 10:19.720
All right, team, this is
a class one threat so I want you to...

10:19.880 --> 10:21.041
All right, enough talk...

10:21.200 --> 10:23.885
I'm not afraid of this
overgrown calculator with attitude.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.726
Lantern, we all know you are fearless.
Just wait until...

10:30.360 --> 10:32.044
At least I can make a plan for the rest...

10:33.920 --> 10:35.809
So, that's what that feels like.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.246
Two millimeters backward.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.441
Ah, there!

10:41.080 --> 10:43.651
Now, all the jars are once again even.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.408
Perfect!

10:50.920 --> 10:51.921
What's this?

10:52.240 --> 10:55.687
The Earth data file appears
to have a firewall defense.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.609
Activating malware.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.081
Please identify yourselves by name.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.971
I prefer to defeat you
in alphabetical order.

11:14.360 --> 11:19.810
The Justice League will not be filed,
stamped, indexed, cataloged, or collected.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.130
Then, you will be deleted.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.529
Control, alt, destroy.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.601
Missiles! If you think I'm gonna turn
chicken because of a bunch of...

11:35.960 --> 11:37.928
Missiles that fire laser beams?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.566
Nope, still not afraid.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.529
Glad I polished these bracelets.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.000
Incoming!

11:53.120 --> 11:55.566
Check out my spinning laser attack!

11:58.120 --> 12:02.250
Oh, yeah? Well, check out my,
taking-care-of-these-missiles attack.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.246
I'm still working on the name.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.321
Ha!

12:06.600 --> 12:08.489
You keep working on that, Flash.

12:09.560 --> 12:13.406
In the meantime, I'll show you how
to put the bite on these bombs.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.641
See what I did there?

12:23.320 --> 12:26.210
Ugh, boys. Always fighting.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.204
Perhaps we can solve this peacefully.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.561
Hey!

12:35.800 --> 12:37.882
Okay, you asked for it, buddy.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.041
You gave him a black eye!

12:47.280 --> 12:48.281
Whoa.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.686
Ow. Probably, should have
slipped into that jetpack.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.770
Don't worry, Flash.
I'll get you back in the fight.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.241
Oh, no.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.361
Whoa!

13:10.360 --> 13:11.361
Huh?

13:11.640 --> 13:15.042
Wonder Woman, check out the mustache.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.370
Flash! Look at you.
You are quite the go-getter.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.484
And don't forget,
I magnetized your space boots.

13:29.440 --> 13:33.411
Hey, hey, now my boots will
match my magnetic personality.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.123
Hey, Brainiac, get a load of this.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.727
Here's something that will
really turn your head.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.084
Too easy.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.363
Destroying my peripherals
is not part of the program.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.931
Error, error!

14:13.680 --> 14:14.761
Recalculating.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.845
Units of Earth...

14:17.120 --> 14:20.920
I have selected your planet
for permanent back-up in my archives.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.209
Prepare to be downsized.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.804
Activating shrink-ray.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.446
Everyone, stand back, I've got this.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.801
My shrink-ray! You broke it!

14:41.000 --> 14:45.801
Nothing like soaking up some rays from
old Mr. Sunshine to charge up my powers.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.926
The Earth doesn't want
or need your type of saving.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.410
It is under the protection
of the Justice League.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.481
Accessing Justice League.

14:55.880 --> 15:00.010
Super speed, super circuits,
super warrior, super jewelry.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.328
And this one has no powers?

15:03.800 --> 15:05.211
Well, he won't be a problem.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.161
Super alien?

15:07.400 --> 15:12.008
Ah, greetings Kryptonian, you are
mis-assigned to an incorrect planet.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.890
You will be re-cataloged.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.601
Don't count on it.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.201
Argh!

15:35.320 --> 15:37.004
I think he's had enough, Superman.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.566
You don't wanna really hurt him.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.280
No, of course not.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.889
Recalculating, recalculating...

15:49.880 --> 15:51.211
Well, that should do it.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.849
Sometimes I forget
how much power I absorb from the Sun.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.085
Brainiac has regained control,
but is retreating.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.090
Yes!

16:01.720 --> 16:03.529
- All right! Yes!
- All right! Great job! Yeah!

16:04.200 --> 16:08.524
Bye-bye, Lame-iac,
or should I call you Run-away-niac?

16:10.080 --> 16:12.890
I hate to break up the party,
but we only have so much oxygen

16:13.120 --> 16:16.408
and Flash tends to burn
through it every time he starts talking!

16:16.840 --> 16:19.446
Hmm, not every time.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.247
It seems that I...

16:33.520 --> 16:37.286
Miscalculated the power level
of the Justice League units.

16:37.520 --> 16:41.605
Calculating to the nth degree,
there is a 92% probability

16:41.760 --> 16:45.082
of this Justice League preventing
my acquisition of planet Earth.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.605
Amending plan...

16:47.880 --> 16:50.929
Return to Brainiac Prime for
required repair and upgrade.

17:31.640 --> 17:35.804
Ah. Brainiac 1.1.
I ascertain that you are back.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.290
Clearly, 1.4...

17:39.080 --> 17:42.766
My vessel sustained damage in an
altercation with super-powered beings.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.525
See that she is repaired!

17:44.800 --> 17:46.484
And it could do with a coat of wax.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.122
Understood, Brainiac 1.1. It will be done.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.006
Acknowledged, Brainiac 1.4.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.321
And, Brainiac?

17:54.680 --> 17:55.681
Yes, Brainiac?

17:56.240 --> 17:57.401
Two coats.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.723
Don't skimp like last time.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.322
"Don't skimp like last time."

18:05.320 --> 18:08.847
Well, if isn't the mighty Brainiac 1.1?

18:09.600 --> 18:13.730
Brainiac 1.2, Brainiac 1.3,
nice to see you!

18:13.960 --> 18:18.249
It appears your vessel has
been upgraded with a mustache.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.769
And downgraded with a black eye!

18:22.200 --> 18:24.965
Even the shrink-ray is inoperative.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.090
Nothing that I can't handle!

18:27.360 --> 18:29.203
However, I shall require

18:29.400 --> 18:32.370
the premium Brainiac vessel
with all the extras.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.090
Although, it lacks a shrink-ray,
the premium vessel is exceptional!

18:43.480 --> 18:45.687
How come you get to
use the premium vessel?

18:46.360 --> 18:49.728
Because, Brainiac 1.3, 1.2,

18:50.200 --> 18:52.726
I am Brainiac 1.1!

18:53.880 --> 18:57.168
I will return to Earth
and begin the cataloging process.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.962
You will deliver my original vehicle
to me as soon as it is repaired.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.723
You're number one for now,
but soon, I'll be number one.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.770
You're number two for now,
but soon, I'll be number two.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.211
That Brainiac is a jerk.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.768
Did you see the way Superman
threw that thing?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.765
Put some serious spin on it.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.644
My boy could pitch for the Majors!

19:38.120 --> 19:41.249
But I would never do that
because it wouldn't be fair.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.889
Anyway, I couldn't have done it without
the help of my closest friends.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.923
Oh, and also my work colleagues.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.611
Don't mind Bat, Superman.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.610
He's probably thinking up sneaky new
ways to destroy you with Kryptonite

19:53.760 --> 19:55.205
or defeat the rest of us in battle.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.928
Even though we just saved the planet for,
like, the millionth time this week.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.201
Actually, Green Lantern,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.449
I was thinking that we need to figure out
the trajectory of Brainiac's retreat.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.371
Best to be prepared
when he decides to make a return visit.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.127
Return? After a spanking like that?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.488
Yeah, I'm bettin'
we'll never see that freak again.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.641
Uh...

20:16.480 --> 20:18.721
Er, maybe he's just passing by.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.130
Aw, his new ride is so tiny and cute.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.562
Not a problem, I'll deal with it.

20:25.320 --> 20:29.006
Despite our quick victory last time,
Brainiac is a formidable foe.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.925
I think we should come up
with a game plan.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.481
Yeah, okay.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.728
Um, Green Lantern, do you wanna come too?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.446
I'm not afraid of that monotone metronome.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.846
As you've said before.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.490
- Wonder Woman?
- Absolutely!

20:40.720 --> 20:43.610
Perhaps, I can diffuse the situation
before a confrontation arises,

20:43.840 --> 20:45.046
the preferred Amazon way.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.966
And if not, it's beat down time.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.686
Hmm, I was thinking a more in-depth plan.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.011
Oh, this is gonna be good!

20:56.200 --> 20:57.725
I bet Superman is really
going to make this guy

20:58.000 --> 21:00.571
regret coming back
to our neck of the woods.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.565
Hmm!

21:09.360 --> 21:10.805
That's far enough, Brainiac.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.006
Ah, the three most powerful
units of the Justice League.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.531
How fortuitous!

21:16.760 --> 21:20.321
My calculations indicated that
you are the exact units I need

21:20.480 --> 21:23.211
to eliminate in order
to acquire planet Earth.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.964
That energy signature...
A temporal anomaly.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.806
Superman, Wonder Woman,
Green Lantern, get out of there!

21:36.240 --> 21:37.844
Surrender immediately, Brainiac.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.407
We've already wasted enough
time fighting with you.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.524
Where you're going, Wonder Woman,

21:42.720 --> 21:45.326
you will now have
all the time in the world.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.804
They're gone!

21:56.160 --> 22:02.770
Brainiac destroyed Superman,
and Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.567
No, no, no, no,
I can't believe it. Brainiac won?

22:10.800 --> 22:14.407
Oh, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern,

22:14.920 --> 22:18.083
you may be gone forever,
but you'll never be forgotten.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.365
They're not dead, Flash.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.450
They're simply lost in time.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.320
They're what?

22:28.520 --> 22:31.091
The Hall of Justice sensors
picked up a temporal anomaly

22:31.280 --> 22:33.487
just before Brainiac's ray fired off.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.761
If I'm right...

22:34.960 --> 22:36.121
And when is he not?

22:36.320 --> 22:39.642
Brainiac knows he doesn't have
the firepower to destroy the League.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.571
But he can... Send them back through time?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.489
I can trace
the residual temporal currents,

22:44.680 --> 22:47.968
and calibrate a device that can pinpoint
when in time they've been placed...

22:50.880 --> 22:52.120
And, there they are.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.966
Batman, does this mean that we're gonna
build what I think we're gonna build?

22:56.160 --> 22:59.084
It's only been a theory,
but we have to try.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.321
Try what?

23:00.600 --> 23:02.648
Flash, can you get us
to the Batcave quickly?

23:03.120 --> 23:05.088
No problem. Fast is my middle name!

23:05.320 --> 23:06.321
- It is?
- No.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.244
Here, tow ropes. Hold on!

23:08.600 --> 23:09.726
Whoa!

23:19.440 --> 23:20.441
Whee!

23:21.120 --> 23:22.121
Ow!

23:23.520 --> 23:25.329
Pull yourself together, Cyborg.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.651
Wow! The Batcave!

23:31.040 --> 23:34.169
We should totally hang out here. We could
play air hockey and watch movies and...

23:34.760 --> 23:36.125
After we save the world, obviously.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.606
Ugh, four minutes!

23:37.840 --> 23:39.524
Sorry it took so long.
You know what'd be great,

23:39.720 --> 23:42.485
if there was a tunnel all the way from
Metropolis to Gotham, right?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.808
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.771
But in the meantime,
we've got a job to do.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.328
Huh? Huh? Huh?

24:28.080 --> 24:29.889
She is beautiful.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.889
She is gorgeous. She is...

24:32.360 --> 24:33.361
What is she?

24:33.720 --> 24:35.165
The Cosmic Treadmill.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.284
She's a time machine powered
by my super speed.

24:38.800 --> 24:39.926
At least in theory.

24:40.640 --> 24:44.166
Flash and I have been developing the plans
for this device but we've never tested it.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.165
Once activated, it could
very well create a rift in the time stream

24:47.320 --> 24:49.084
causing a chain reaction
throughout the universe

24:49.280 --> 24:52.090
causing all of space-time
to collapse in on itself.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.601
That would not be good.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.401
Uh-oh.

24:57.760 --> 24:58.761
Trouble alert.

24:59.080 --> 25:03.927
Greetings Earth units,
I am Brainiac and I bring good news.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.684
This is being broadcast
all over the world.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.081
How do you know?

25:08.240 --> 25:12.768
I've got built-in satellite, Wi-Fi, and
AM-FM radio, and he's on every channel.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.085
Soon I will begin scanning and
cataloging every species on this planet,

25:17.320 --> 25:20.921
in order to create
a precise record for posterity.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.761
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

25:22.960 --> 25:27.010
Once finished, I will shrink your planet
to a more efficient file size,

25:27.400 --> 25:28.970
place it inside a glass bottle,

25:29.120 --> 25:33.364
and store it safely in my library
of civilizations for all eternity.

25:33.840 --> 25:34.841
You're welcome.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.128
Now, that part I'm not so crazy about.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.651
No time for a test run.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.968
We've got to retrieve Superman,
Wonder Woman and Green Lantern

25:42.120 --> 25:44.248
before Brainiac finishes
indexing the planet.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.210
Flash, it's all up to you.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.170
Definitely not crazy
about this plan either

25:48.320 --> 25:50.482
after that whole collapsing
universe thingy you mentioned.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.801
What about me?

25:52.120 --> 25:55.283
Return to the Hall of Justice and call in
any available auxiliary Leaguers.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.966
See if you can slow down
Brainiac's indexing process.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.810
- On it.
- Faster, Flash.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.810
And, guys, good luck.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.525
I don't believe in luck.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.080
What do you believe in?

26:05.360 --> 26:06.441
Batman!

26:06.800 --> 26:07.801
Flash, hit it.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.325
Faster, Flash. The Cosmic Treadmill
is creating a temporal rift

26:13.480 --> 26:15.323
at Wonder Woman's pre-historic location.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.971
I hope this works!

26:29.360 --> 26:30.486
Wow!

26:44.200 --> 26:45.884
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:47.840 --> 26:49.410
Woo-hoo! We're alive!

26:49.680 --> 26:52.081
Phew. Ah, that was pretty fast,
even for me.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.401
I'll be glad to sit down.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.722
Stay put! Flash, you have to keep running.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.487
It takes an enormous amount of energy to
keep the Batmobile in this timescape.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.889
If you stop, the Cosmic Treadmill
will snap back to our own era,

27:03.040 --> 27:04.201
trapping us here forever.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.845
Okay!

27:06.240 --> 27:08.402
So, I guess I'll just keep running then.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.761
And, you?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.924
The first rule of infiltrating
a different time era is camouflage.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.170
I'll need to blend in in order to find
out where Wonder Woman is.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.641
Blend in?

27:21.120 --> 27:24.647
A Bat caveman outfit?
You keep that in your car?

27:25.000 --> 27:26.081
Yes.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.450
It looks like the temporal
reading is west of here.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.121
I'll go scout it out. You keep running.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.407
Okay, I'll just be here on the Treadmill.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.883
Running, if you need me.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.443
You come with me now.

27:50.240 --> 27:53.642
Let Ugh go, you beast.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.086
Hmm.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.686
Vandal Savage.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.248
The Justice League's never-aging
nemesis back in the time he came from.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.411
Looks like he's been up to no good
since the beginning of history.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.170
Quiet, Arg!

28:08.680 --> 28:10.842
Your grunting not save you.

28:11.120 --> 28:16.001
My name, Ugh!
And Queen am going to find me.

28:18.800 --> 28:23.601
Well, you am my hostage, and when we find
new country that me can rule,

28:24.080 --> 28:26.686
you will be first citizen me oppress.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.408
- Huh?
- Don't count on it, Savage.

28:32.800 --> 28:37.124
Only an uncivilized brute threatens
a woman, or anyone else for that matter.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.409
I not know how you know my name.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.371
But why you dressed like a rat?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.085
It's a bat.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.051
And what have you done with Wonder Woman?

28:45.440 --> 28:47.124
Me no understand your crazy talk.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.927
Plus, me have no time
to chew mastodon fat with you!

28:51.120 --> 28:52.121
Make time.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.762
You am asked for this, Rat Skins.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.246
Huh?

29:06.000 --> 29:10.085
Men, you am so dumb.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.324
While you fight, Ugh catches you.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.851
Ugh, what are you doing?

29:15.080 --> 29:18.448
We take you to Cave Queen now.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.041
We?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.883
Yeah.

29:29.640 --> 29:30.641
So I tell him,

29:30.880 --> 29:34.168
there's no future in red bricks,
you should invest in yellow bricks!

29:34.360 --> 29:36.044
Huh?

29:46.440 --> 29:47.601
Excellent.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.005
With three members
of the Justice League out of the way,

29:51.160 --> 29:53.891
the Earth will soon have a new home...

29:54.240 --> 29:58.882
In my collection
right between Dzizz and Eberth.

30:06.480 --> 30:09.848
Login name, Cyborg. Password, Batfan1.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.250
Aquaman, status?

30:14.600 --> 30:16.409
"20,000 leagues under the sea."

30:17.200 --> 30:18.281
So, no go there.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.448
Hawkman returned to Thanagar
for molting season?

30:22.840 --> 30:24.569
What is that, anyway?

30:25.240 --> 30:27.811
Green Arrow is giving
an archery clinic on Rann?

30:28.080 --> 30:30.128
Everyone on that planet has a ray gun!

30:31.840 --> 30:32.841
Huh...

30:33.120 --> 30:34.451
Superman's secret weapon.

30:34.880 --> 30:35.927
Hmm.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.526
Desperate times call for super measures.

30:46.960 --> 30:47.961
Hello?

30:48.160 --> 30:49.525
What?

30:49.760 --> 30:52.286
Really? The League needs me?

30:52.680 --> 30:54.489
And you signed my permission slip?

30:54.800 --> 30:56.768
Well, I won't let you down, Cyborg.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.610
Sorry, girls, got to run!

30:58.800 --> 31:00.086
Emergency!

31:01.280 --> 31:06.411
Ooh, I can't wait to show the Justice
League that Supergirl is a team player.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.366
These rocks are strangely familiar.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.886
I am in the pre-historic Batcave!

31:25.640 --> 31:27.768
Me not know who you are,

31:28.120 --> 31:31.442
but if not for you,
me would have escaped her vengeance!

31:31.960 --> 31:35.169
Now we stuck between rock and hot place.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.801
Her vengeance?

31:39.160 --> 31:40.525
Who is this her?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.650
She who must be obeyed!

31:43.400 --> 31:45.323
You am soon see for self.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.925
And tremble!

31:47.360 --> 31:50.330
Queen, queen, queen, queen,
queen, queen, queen...

31:51.240 --> 31:53.322
Oh, no! She comes!

31:54.000 --> 31:55.001
Who comes?

31:58.360 --> 31:59.725
Wonder Woman!

31:59.880 --> 32:01.484
Silence, miscreant male.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.600
You've been caught helping the evil Vandal
Savage escape with one of my women.

32:06.040 --> 32:10.409
And for that, you will be cleansed in the
fire of the mountain like roasted geese.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.170
Hmm, apparently, Brainiac's time-beam

32:20.320 --> 32:22.607
is so jarring it creates a form of amnesia.

32:23.160 --> 32:24.844
If I can get her to remember who she is,

32:25.040 --> 32:27.646
the timestream's natural elasticity
should reject her,

32:27.880 --> 32:29.644
sending her back to our own time.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.401
But, how?

32:31.760 --> 32:34.684
Lower them into the fire
like the pigs they are!

32:37.440 --> 32:42.082
No point in learning name now.
We am doomed!

32:42.880 --> 32:44.291
Wonder Woman, wait!

32:46.440 --> 32:49.762
What male dares speak to our queen?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.570
You may speak.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.964
You don't remember me,
but I have come to bring you home.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.401
Home?

32:59.560 --> 33:01.324
I know no home but here.

33:01.720 --> 33:07.648
When queen arrived, we subjugated
by Vandal Savage's cavemen.

33:08.280 --> 33:12.251
She led glorious revolt
against you oppressors.

33:12.560 --> 33:13.766
I am not one of them.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.963
Think, Wonder Woman, you know me.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.248
I'm your... I'm your...

33:18.920 --> 33:20.081
Co-worker.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.647
I'm Batman.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.685
Batman?

33:24.120 --> 33:29.251
You think great Queen
would ally herself with a man?

33:38.280 --> 33:41.124
You may not know me, but I know you.

33:42.040 --> 33:48.082
I, Batman, challenge the Queen of
the Cavewomen to ritual trial by combat.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.283
Or do you fear to do battle against a man?

33:58.840 --> 34:00.285
I fear no man!

34:01.200 --> 34:04.886
Combat, combat, combat,
combat, combat, combat...

34:20.159 --> 34:21.400
Oh, oh, dinosaurs!

34:24.600 --> 34:25.886
Phew.

34:26.679 --> 34:30.241
Batman, oh, Batman, please... Anytime now.

34:38.800 --> 34:39.960
Ha!

34:41.080 --> 34:42.844
I will make this quick.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.648
I only have one chance at this.
My timing must be perfect.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.728
No rope can hold me, man!

35:06.200 --> 35:08.362
I don't need your magic lasso to hold you.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.962
I need it to make you tell me the truth.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.686
Who are you?

35:14.200 --> 35:17.044
I... I... I am Queen of...

35:17.360 --> 35:19.806
The magic lasso compels you
to speak the truth,

35:20.080 --> 35:22.208
even a truth you've forgotten.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.685
I... I...

35:25.480 --> 35:28.245
I am Wonder Woman!

35:41.400 --> 35:42.890
Pre-historic Persephone!

35:43.400 --> 35:46.722
Batman, you rescued me, but how?

35:46.880 --> 35:48.928
No time to explain, if I am right...

35:49.120 --> 35:50.201
You usually are.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.489
Now that you've remembered who you are,
the timestream will try to correct itself

35:53.640 --> 35:55.529
and you will transition back to our time.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.045
It's happening already.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.081
Flash and I will get the others.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.527
You make sure that Brainiac
doesn't shrink the Earth.

36:04.040 --> 36:08.170
Ugh, my faithful servant,
you are left in charge of the clan now.

36:09.160 --> 36:12.926
And what we do with Vandal Savage?

36:15.480 --> 36:18.848
No matter. Steer clear
of evil men such as him,

36:19.320 --> 36:22.324
and remember that
you are more powerful together than alone.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.281
What now?

36:26.600 --> 36:28.807
Without Queen, we defenseless.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.207
No!

36:30.400 --> 36:32.368
What Queen said was true.

36:32.880 --> 36:37.647
We stick together,
we leave this land, find a place!

36:38.360 --> 36:40.408
An island maybe,

36:40.800 --> 36:45.362
where we live in peace,
away from evil of man.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.524
It would be paradise.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.205
So, that's how it happened.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.122
Better get back to Flash.
He must be bored out of his mind by now.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.324
Batman!

37:16.240 --> 37:18.481
Staring? Why don't you take a picture?

37:18.640 --> 37:21.007
It'll last longer!

37:21.320 --> 37:25.689
If there's one thing I cannot abide in
interplanetary drones, it's rudeness.

37:28.520 --> 37:29.521
Good job, Supergirl.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.041
But there's more where that came from.
Stay focused.

37:32.520 --> 37:35.683
Focused? Oh, they don't come
much more focused than me, Cyborg.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.047
Oh, look, a kitten.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.525
Yay, Cyborg!

37:47.520 --> 37:49.124
We're awesome and it shows.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.123
We're smashing scanner drones.

37:51.600 --> 37:55.321
When Justice League is on the case,
Brainiac's a loser face.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.121
Yay!

37:58.040 --> 37:59.530
Loser face?

38:00.040 --> 38:01.690
That does not even compute.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.443
Stop, you are interfering with the...

38:06.040 --> 38:08.441
Those drones are not cheap to build.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.564
My stuff! Stop touching my stuff!

38:13.480 --> 38:16.882
Recalculating, recalculating,
recalculating...

38:18.720 --> 38:20.722
Initiating drone defense protocol.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.845
For that you get my cheer of doom.

38:34.480 --> 38:39.088
Give me a D. Give me an O.
Give me another O.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.369
Give me a M... What's that spell?

38:42.560 --> 38:44.005
Doom!

38:44.240 --> 38:46.686
Woo-hoo. Nice job, Supergirl.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.847
Hey, I was wondering when you'd show up.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.526
Wonder Woman!
Oh, I've always wanted to fight evil

38:56.680 --> 38:59.331
alongside the greatest superhero in the...

38:59.520 --> 39:01.488
That's an interesting outfit choice.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.920
Talk later, Supergirl. Fight now.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.641
Okay!

39:07.000 --> 39:10.604
Robot drones don't stand a chance,
we're gonna kick their underpants.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.411
Go team!

39:12.960 --> 39:15.566
Yeah, underpants! Whoo!

39:21.960 --> 39:23.450
Oh.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.961
Took you long enough.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.648
There's no time to chat, Flash.
Next stop, 1741.

39:29.880 --> 39:30.961
Step on it.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.810
Was that a joke? Step on it? Argh.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.644
Who knew you were so funny, Batman?

39:36.960 --> 39:38.450
Okay, okay.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.326
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.241
We are on the water. We're gonna sink.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.002
- Oh.
- Bat-pontoons deployed.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.962
Relax, Flash, the Batmobile is
prepared for virtually anything.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.201
Oh, really?

40:00.440 --> 40:02.488
Does it come with a Bat-pirate costume?

40:15.320 --> 40:18.130
Keep a sharp eye, ye scurvy dogs.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.767
Fog's as thick as the devil's dandruff.

40:24.760 --> 40:26.091
Avast there, swabby.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.731
This deck be looking
like a Tortuga shanty.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.362
Remember what I told ye.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.682
Aye, aye, Captain Fear, sir.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.289
You said that if you couldn't eat
your cod salad off the deck of the ship,

40:38.440 --> 40:40.488
I'd be feeding sharks on the open sea.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.126
Well...

40:42.320 --> 40:43.845
Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Right away, sir.

40:44.480 --> 40:47.723
Ah, well, that be more like it.

40:48.040 --> 40:52.125
Captain, something
coming at us fast, off the port side!

40:52.640 --> 40:54.369
Hmm.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.361
It be a boat.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.806
It be a fish.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.203
No, it's a dude surfing on a shark. Duh.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.247
Oh.

41:23.880 --> 41:28.522
Well, you be a long way
from land there, matey.

41:28.680 --> 41:29.727
I, uh,

41:30.400 --> 41:32.767
lost me ship to a hungry kraken,

41:32.920 --> 41:36.686
and had to commandeer
that passing sea critter for travel.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.927
Hmm.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.683
What be your name?

41:40.960 --> 41:45.170
There be those would call me Bat Beard.

41:45.760 --> 41:46.807
I see no beard.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.287
I shaved.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.610
Well, any man that can tame a great white

41:51.880 --> 41:54.770
as fearlessly as ye
is welcome on me vessel.

41:55.080 --> 41:59.529
Work hard and fight alongside us,
and you will get part of the plunder.

41:59.880 --> 42:00.961
What say you?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.331
I say huzzah.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.085
Huzzah!

42:09.360 --> 42:12.409
Now, you yellow-bellied swabby
below my contempt,

42:12.640 --> 42:13.971
show him to his hammock,

42:14.240 --> 42:19.371
then report back to the forecastle, throw
dirt on it, and clean it all over again.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.846
Aye-aye, Captain.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.886
Follow me, stranger.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.965
Hmm, treasure chest.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.244
Away from my booty, you salty dog.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.490
Huh, dude.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.243
Hal, it's me, Batman.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.684
Who? I thought you said
you were Bat Beard.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.161
If the Captain knew
you were lying, he'd...

42:43.720 --> 42:46.200
Well, I don't know what he'd do,
but I'm afraid to find out.

42:46.720 --> 42:47.801
Afraid?

42:48.080 --> 42:49.605
Hal, you aren't afraid of anything.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.451
Your power ring, where is it?

42:52.960 --> 42:54.246
That green ring?

42:54.840 --> 42:58.208
The Captain took it when he fished me out
of the sea as payment to be on his crew.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.290
It's locked up in his chest.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.647
We have to get it.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.884
It might be the only way to
help you remember who you are.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.121
Are you mad?

43:06.400 --> 43:09.165
If the Captain found out,
he'd keelhaul us.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.490
Fine, I'll do it myself.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.241
But I need a distraction.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.851
Will you at least do that for me?

43:15.520 --> 43:17.602
Oh. Uh, okay.

43:26.680 --> 43:31.402
Up and down, up and down,
on and on and... Brr.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.085
I don't feel so good.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.041
Maybe I should eat something.

43:35.200 --> 43:38.682
The famous Flash emergency protein. Mmm.

43:38.880 --> 43:39.961
Hey. Hey!

43:40.200 --> 43:41.281
Ow!

43:42.920 --> 43:44.843
Argh! Flying fish attack!

43:46.240 --> 43:48.049
Oh, I really hate treadmills.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.043
Whoa!

44:05.240 --> 44:06.321
Dude.

44:14.080 --> 44:17.607
Oh, you clumsy oaf, look what you've done.

44:17.880 --> 44:21.089
You befouled my ship,
you lousy landlubber.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.048
You find anything interesting?

44:30.080 --> 44:32.845
The number one rule of the sea, laddie,

44:33.240 --> 44:35.720
keep your hands off the captain's booty.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.604
There's gotta be
a better way to phrase that.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.611
You ratted me out, Hal?

44:40.800 --> 44:42.882
I'm sorry, Bat Beard.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.283
- I just...
- You did good, swabby.

44:45.440 --> 44:48.284
It's time for
our sticky-fingered friend here

44:48.520 --> 44:51.444
to take a little walk... On the plank.

45:01.920 --> 45:06.801
Maybe Davy Jones will teach you
not to steal what I've rightfully stolen.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.288
Now, out on the plank with ye.

45:09.720 --> 45:14.806
There's an old friend waiting
to make your acquaintance.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.210
Hal, you may not believe it now,

45:19.440 --> 45:22.125
but I know that you
are the most fearless man alive.

45:22.600 --> 45:23.681
Be that man.

45:23.960 --> 45:25.769
Stow your scuttlebutt, matey.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.803
It's into the sea with ye.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.125
I believe in you, Hal.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.207
Har, har.

45:43.680 --> 45:44.806
Huh.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.171
What in the blue blazes?

45:52.320 --> 45:56.803
Wrong, Captain Fear,
not blue blazes, green.

45:58.480 --> 46:03.771
In brightest day, in blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.450
Let those who worship evil's might,
beware my power, Green Lantern's light.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.728
Fire on that swabby, he's bewitched.

46:20.440 --> 46:22.681
I'm not your swabby anymore, Captain,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.048
and I don't take orders from Fear.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.042
What? Not cool, bro.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.924
Dude!

46:41.560 --> 46:46.248
Shiver me timbers.
Tis the day Captain Fear feared the most.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.081
Bet you're expecting me
to admit I was wrong about you

46:58.240 --> 47:00.720
just because you said all
those nice words back there.

47:01.200 --> 47:03.441
I said what I thought
might get the job done.

47:04.480 --> 47:05.561
I was right.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.529
And, when are you not?

47:10.480 --> 47:14.007
Uh, Batman,
I am starting to turn invisible.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.884
That's time repairing itself.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.008
You're being sent back to our proper time.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.682
- Well, Batman, what about you?
- I'll be fine.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.242
Go, help the others against Brainiac.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.401
If I were you, I'd start swimming.

47:35.920 --> 47:40.767
My finny friend is nearby
and I think he wants to say hello.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.884
Swim away, argh, swim away!

47:46.040 --> 47:48.441
Faster!

47:50.440 --> 47:52.124
Ooh, you don't look so good.

47:52.520 --> 47:56.809
Flying fish stole
my chicken leg, need energy.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.451
This should help.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.483
You have your own vitamin drink?

48:01.960 --> 48:04.486
Crime never dries up, but heroes can.

48:04.680 --> 48:07.251
That's why I developed
my own vitamin supplement.

48:07.520 --> 48:08.567
Drink up, Flash.

48:09.480 --> 48:11.289
And let's go save Superman.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.046
Whoa!

48:16.640 --> 48:20.406
Wow, Batman, this stuff is amazing.
I never felt so alive.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.040
Do you have another can? I'd love
another can. Can I get another can?

48:23.200 --> 48:24.611
I feel like I can take on the world.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.170
Uh-oh.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.686
Brainiac's drones fight
like the fire oxen of...

48:51.000 --> 48:53.606
Chainsaw, crowbar, sugar, spice.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.768
Smash those robots, don't play nice.

48:56.040 --> 48:59.089
Cookies, candies, dynamite...

48:59.280 --> 49:02.363
Brainiac's drones will be destroyed
and exploded into a million pieces.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.445
- I got this.
- What? What?

49:08.600 --> 49:10.090
- You got this.
- Who? Who?

49:10.240 --> 49:12.368
- We got this.
- Woohoo!

49:12.520 --> 49:13.567
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

49:14.360 --> 49:15.691
Ah, youth.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.650
Wonder Woman, look out.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.165
Hey, gang. Miss me?

49:24.880 --> 49:27.451
Hal, Batman saved you too.

49:27.920 --> 49:30.048
Well, I helped, but, yeah.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.121
Batman.

49:34.240 --> 49:38.962
So, Batman found a way to retrieve Wonder
Woman and Green Lantern.

49:39.720 --> 49:41.245
This stinks.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.085
Oh, it's you.

49:46.440 --> 49:48.329
How are the repairs
to my ship progressing?

49:48.720 --> 49:50.404
It's nice to see you too.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.891
I didn't mean to be rude, Brainiac 1.3,
but I am in the middle of something.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.804
Oh, he's in the middle of something.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.928
Maybe we're in the middle
of something too.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.766
Your ship is 83% complete.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.446
Bring it as soon as it's ready.

50:03.720 --> 50:05.131
Oh, can we?

50:06.440 --> 50:08.283
Brainiacs.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.448
Let's see how these heroes
deal with a blast from the past.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.760
Oh, what now?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.571
Maybe Brainiac is sending
a message that he's giving up.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.291
Or he's opening a portal
in time to return the others.

50:39.320 --> 50:41.243
Or that.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.442
Do you have a cheer for
attacking blood-thirsty dinosaurs

50:43.640 --> 50:44.641
that are about to eat us?

50:48.960 --> 50:50.724
Whoa!

51:01.280 --> 51:02.486
It can't be.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.044
The future.

51:07.560 --> 51:13.488
Whoa, I thought the future would be
flying cars or jetpacks or robots.

51:13.640 --> 51:17.486
Life forms detected.
Initializing response.

51:17.640 --> 51:18.846
Disintegration.

51:22.480 --> 51:25.324
- Batman, something's wrong.
- Hold on, Flash.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.524
We're losing temporal displacement energy.

51:30.680 --> 51:33.081
Time is snapping the Batmobile
to its proper place.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.602
- Batman!
- Don't worry about me, Flash.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.405
Help the others.

51:38.360 --> 51:39.361
Hmm.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.409
Looks like I lost my ride home.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.449
Welcome to the future, Batman.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.651
Superman, thank goodness I found you.

51:46.840 --> 51:49.525
Do not thank goodness, it is an illusion.

51:49.680 --> 51:53.287
Thank Brainiac. Don't you just
love the upgrades he gave me?

51:53.440 --> 51:55.169
No.

51:55.400 --> 51:56.401
Yes.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.290
You see, Brainiac from your era

51:58.520 --> 52:01.046
figured out you were
traveling through time to rescue me,

52:01.200 --> 52:04.329
which means future Brainiac
also became aware of your plans.

52:04.520 --> 52:07.569
So, he sent me to destroy you on arrival.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.724
It's so funny how this
time travel stuff works, isn't it?

52:13.080 --> 52:17.324
We hope you enjoy your time here in
Brainiactropolis before you are vaporized.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.564
Hold still, this will
only sting for a brief moment.

52:27.360 --> 52:31.081
Execute programing,
crush, delete, destroy Batman.

52:31.520 --> 52:33.921
Please remember, it's not personal.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.642
That's strange, motion impaired.

52:38.920 --> 52:41.810
Hmm, some kind of magnetic field.

52:42.120 --> 52:43.246
Someone else is here.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.562
You don't have to be a mind reader
to figure that out.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.122
Now, Lightning Lad.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.001
Uh-oh.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.363
That won't hold Brainiac-Superman
for long.

52:59.760 --> 53:03.128
Come with us if you'd like to
avoid being smashed into Bat paste.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.684
- I don't think I should trust these...
- "Why should you trust us?

53:06.840 --> 53:08.524
"Us? Us?"

53:08.760 --> 53:10.649
Because, you really don't have any choice.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.445
Oice. Oice.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.087
And, yeah, I can read minds.

53:15.240 --> 53:18.961
Saturn Girl, Cosmic Boy,
he is generating that magnetic field,

53:19.280 --> 53:20.611
and Lightning Lad...

53:20.800 --> 53:22.848
Electricity power, I got it

53:23.160 --> 53:25.322
and I'm not even a telepath.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.406
He's about to break free.

53:27.800 --> 53:31.362
I don't mean to pull rank, but, technically
I was the last elected leader, so...

53:31.560 --> 53:35.485
Rank is the word, all right,
as in your smell.

53:35.880 --> 53:39.009
Soap and water are pretty hard
to come by since the world ended.

53:39.160 --> 53:41.686
Okay, less bickering,
more escaping with our lives.

53:56.720 --> 53:59.371
My Welcome Wagon program was interrupted.

53:59.800 --> 54:02.531
I must execute program End Batman.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.684
Who are you people?

54:09.840 --> 54:13.447
We were the Legion of Super-Heroes,
now, we're what's left of them.

54:13.880 --> 54:17.327
Just think of us as
the anti-Brainiac resistance.

54:17.560 --> 54:20.848
Before Brainiac came,
this place was a utopia.

54:21.240 --> 54:24.687
Hey, it's not all bad.
There's plenty of parking spaces.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.848
Welcome to resistance headquarters.

54:35.680 --> 54:36.681
Ugh.

54:36.840 --> 54:39.684
You'll get used to the sewage smell
after a few weeks.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.611
According to historical data...

54:41.840 --> 54:44.207
Brainiac was unable to defeat
Superman in your time,

54:44.360 --> 54:47.409
so he hurled Superman into a future where
Brainiac could develop the technology

54:47.560 --> 54:49.608
to assimilate him and turn him
into the ultimate weapon.

54:49.840 --> 54:53.721
Could you please not read my mind?
And stop finishing my sentences for once.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.166
I never read your mind, okay?

54:55.360 --> 54:57.567
It's always just obvious
what you're going to say next.

54:57.720 --> 55:00.769
History also tells us
that you and Superman were good friends.

55:02.680 --> 55:05.604
Maybe we can use your special
knowledge of Superman to free him.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.560
Then, together, we can rise up
and defeat Brainiac.

55:08.720 --> 55:10.563
- Yeah!
- Yeah, what do you say?

55:11.400 --> 55:14.085
I've been preparing
for this day for a long time.

55:14.440 --> 55:17.250
There's only one way
to stop Brainiac-Superman,

55:17.560 --> 55:20.848
but to do it, I'll need
to get to the Batcave in Gotham City.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.241
Are you crazy?

55:22.400 --> 55:24.562
The streets are patrolled
by Brainiac's killer robots,

55:24.720 --> 55:26.563
you'd be destroyed the minute
you left our hideout.

55:26.800 --> 55:29.280
And not to mention Brainiac-Superman.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.843
Oh, that is a good idea, Batman.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.843
Sorry, he was wondering
if Wayne Enterprises

55:36.000 --> 55:38.480
had ever constructed a tunnel
from Metropolis to Gotham.

55:38.640 --> 55:40.927
As a matter of fact, it did.

55:41.480 --> 55:42.970
Brainiac has sensors everywhere.

55:43.680 --> 55:47.480
If you're on the move, he'll know
and he'll send Brainiac-Superman.

55:47.880 --> 55:50.690
Then I'll have to hope
someone slows him down.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.688
You guys look like you need a pick-me-up.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.530
How about a recharge?

56:07.080 --> 56:08.241
Disintegration.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.486
I don't know why you bother,

56:10.640 --> 56:13.291
you're never going to get a laugh
out of them, they're killer robots.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.201
That's why I use killer material.

56:29.680 --> 56:32.081
That's a little trick
Karate Kid taught me.

56:32.480 --> 56:33.811
Think that got his attention?

56:34.040 --> 56:35.610
Oh, I know so.

56:44.160 --> 56:46.891
Hmm, observation, Batman is absent.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.011
Too bad, I was looking forward
to seeing him again...

56:50.200 --> 56:51.281
Before I crushed him.

56:51.520 --> 56:53.807
Who needs Batman when you have us?

56:55.040 --> 56:58.169
Resistance is pointless,
Lightning Lad, no offense.

57:00.560 --> 57:01.641
Argh.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.968
Garth!

57:15.840 --> 57:17.888
- Rokk!
- Where is Batman?

57:18.040 --> 57:20.566
I need to execute
my Welcome Wagon program.

57:22.680 --> 57:26.366
Far from here, Brainiac-Superman,
you'll never find him.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.170
Don't be so sure.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.361
Have a nice day.

57:40.880 --> 57:45.124
Gotham City. I can smell it.

57:46.320 --> 57:47.606
Clearly my future self

57:47.800 --> 57:51.088
must have followed up on Flash's
suggestion of a Metropolis-Gotham tunnel.

57:51.880 --> 57:54.406
The Flash was right. Amazing.

58:01.960 --> 58:03.291
The Batcave again.

58:04.720 --> 58:07.451
Now I know what 1,000 years
without Alfred dusting looks like.

58:08.240 --> 58:10.288
If Earth survives,
I should give him a raise.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.480
The Batsafe.

58:14.920 --> 58:19.687
Behind its rusted door
lies the key to Earth's salvation.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.091
Oh, hey, Batman.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.766
Boy, I'm a little disappointed
to find you here.

58:26.480 --> 58:29.768
Fleeing to the Batcave,
kind of predictable, don't you think?

58:34.040 --> 58:35.883
You still resist me, Batman?

58:36.120 --> 58:38.441
None can stand up
to the Brainiac Collective.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.126
Come on, Batman.

58:44.280 --> 58:45.361
Don't you remember?

58:45.560 --> 58:48.928
I am the best at hide-and-seek,
you cannot hide from me.

58:49.120 --> 58:51.122
Don't you remember, Superman?

58:51.440 --> 58:55.081
You never played hide-and-seek with me.

58:56.480 --> 58:59.723
Besides, who says I'm hiding?

59:00.240 --> 59:02.288
So, the Dark Knight dons his armor.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.966
It doesn't stand a chance
against my Super Strength.

59:14.800 --> 59:17.610
Now, I can complete
the Welcome Wagon program.

59:17.920 --> 59:20.400
For your enjoyment, I have set it to music.

59:22.440 --> 59:24.647
So, you're in the future

59:24.880 --> 59:27.042
And just so you're not bored

59:27.520 --> 59:29.841
Into the Brainiac Collective

59:30.240 --> 59:32.368
You will be absorbed

59:33.000 --> 59:35.844
Your battle suit won't help you

59:36.160 --> 59:38.447
This ain't much of a fight

59:38.840 --> 59:41.889
I'm so darn invulnerable

59:42.200 --> 59:44.931
Don't even fear a dinosaur bite

59:45.360 --> 59:47.647
Now, don't move a muscle

59:47.960 --> 59:49.689
This won't hurt a bit

59:49.920 --> 59:52.969
I'll melt that armor off you

59:53.520 --> 59:55.522
Lickety-split

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.242
Thank you, I knew that safe
would be too rusty to open.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.688
Ah, your old Kryptonite stash.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.800
Hey, you were right, I finally turned evil
and now you get to use it on me.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.523
Boy, when you plan ahead,
you really plan ahead.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.041
Kryptonite's not part
of the plan today, this is.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.321
Ow. Ugh.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.644
What is...

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.368
Yellow sunlight, concentrated
and magnified 1,000 times,

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.049
enough to power up Superman
and melt down Brainiac.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.451
No, you'll never...

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.251
Fight him, Superman,
I know you're still in there.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.087
Argh.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.409
Superman? Clark?

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.528
Superman is no more,

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.047
there is only Brainiac.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.602
Your friend is gone forever, Batman.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.287
Friends...

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.441
Batman...

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.006
It's me, Superman, you can do this.
You can fight this.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.523
Do it for Earth,
do it for the Justice League.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.605
Batman, you did it, you saved me.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.129
You could've defeated me
with your Kryptonite.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.091
But, your sun-ray device...

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.325
How did you know it would wake me
from Brainiac's influence?

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.405
I didn't, but I had to take that chance.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.008
It's my job to prepare for the worst
that this world can throw at me.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.407
But I also always prepare
for a friend in need.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.847
Thank you, Bruce.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.601
Now, let's go get Brainiac.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.809
What, what's happening?

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.488
Now that you remember,
you're been drawn back to your own time.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.001
Why aren't you?

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.568
Unfortunately, I am stranded here.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.966
No.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.005
Make my sacrifice worthwhile, Superman.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.050
Make sure you stop this future
from ever happening.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.488
Goodbye, my friend.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.887
Legionnaires, I knew you would
find a way to survive.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.805
Yes, and we found something else as well.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.202
That's a good boy, follow me.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.370
This was a bad idea.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:08.924
So much trouble, so much pain,
I don't wanna see a dinosaur ever again.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.205
- Nice work, team.
- Huh.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.566
Superman.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.442
- Batman did it!
- I knew it.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.808
Especially good work from you, Supergirl.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.890
You're growing up fast, young lady.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.970
Wait a minute, where is Batman?

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.411
Yes, where indeed?

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.806
Ah, finally.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.606
Greetings, Brainiac.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.891
Brainiac 1.2, Brainiac 1.3,
you are .0761 seconds late.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.761
I just finished cataloging
everything on the Earth,

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.361
I am ready to shrink.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.928
Well, we have a surprise
for you, Brainiac.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.089
The Shrink-ray 2.0.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.603
- You will notice, it is even superior to...
- My calculations indicate

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.649
that I will, no doubt,
find it is a booby trap

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.450
designed to destroy me when I activate it.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.841
You are quite correct and... Wait, what?

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.129
Apparently, his calculations
were better than ours.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.569
Of course, I am Brainiac 1.1.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.769
Whatever you calculate,
I calculate it first.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.847
It was his calculation.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.445
I calculated you would say that.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.051
All the other Brainiacs
now advance two numbers in rank.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.520
That should be good for morale.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.161
Now, back to work.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.929
Booby trap deactivated, amateurs.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.246
Now, I have the power.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.329
Well, there's gotta be a way to go back
to the future and save Batman, right?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.251
Batman wants us to save
the Earth from Brainiac first.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.684
We'll have to figure out a way
to save Batman, later.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.129
Oh, no, he didn't.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.521
I think he did.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.364
Ah, mission accomplished.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.485
Look, up in the sky.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.563
- It's massive.
- It's scary.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.922
No, it's... It's...

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.566
It's a bottle.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.566
Thank Hera.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.165
- You're back.
- Batman.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.808
Brainiac has already won,
we've been bottled.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.884
But, how did you get here?

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.201
Time sphere.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.768
The Legion has only one that wasn't
destroyed when Brainiac took over.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.930
It had just enough power to...

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.203
- But, Brainiac-Superman...
- Thought he destroyed the Legion.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.446
But it was all an illusion
projected into your mind by Saturn Girl.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.929
Now, let's get uncorked and un-shrunk.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.851
Even with our combined strength,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.162
we're gonna need more power
to move that big cork.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.124
I think I have just the thing.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.764
Nice work, Cyborg. These jets are swell.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.402
Thanks, I'll build one more
when Supergirl gets her pilot's license.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.728
- Seriously?
- We'll see.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.086
Aw.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.722
All right, team, let's all
concentrate our firepower in one area.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.961
Follow my lead.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:17.881
Wait for it, wait for it...
Mega batarangs away.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.449
Sonic screeches on maximum.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.805
Heat vision activated.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.166
Energy stars.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.010
Lantern lasers.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.765
Speed force lightning.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.641
It's working!

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.767
Huh, uncorked, one of my world's is no
longer in its original packaging.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.521
This must be the work
of the Justice League.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.006
They will pay.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.005
We got a bogey, 12 o'clock.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.366
It's noon already?

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.726
Yeah, no wonder I'm starving.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.486
No, Supergirl, Brainiac, he's right there.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.886
Very clever.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:24.404
Let us see how clever you are
once I shrinkify you into non-existence.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.201
Evasive maneuvers.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.044
Abrasive maneuvers.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:36.529
- Argh! Argh!
- In your face-ive maneuvers.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.406
We've got to figure out a way
to turn off his shrink-ray.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.162
I have an idea, but it means
you have to keep him distracted.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.885
Consider it done, Batman.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.723
All right, team,
you heard the man, let's do this.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.051
Super-speed spin attack.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.961
Argh.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.649
Air brakes, engage.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.002
Brainiac's brain.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.401
Hmm.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.810
You Earthlings give me such a headache.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.567
Fascinating.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.567
Enough.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.368
Your silly sounds and imaginary words
do not even compute.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.961
Argh!

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.286
We're losing this thing.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.964
I don't mean to be negative,
but we're doomed.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.926
Wrong, Flash.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.609
We've only just begun.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.285
Cyborg, execute plan M.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.889
It's time for our secret weapon,

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.811
Justice League, initialize Mecha-leaguer.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.808
This does not compute.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.204
Go, Mecha-leaguer.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.608
Okay, Brainiac,
time to pick on someone your own size.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.404
Well, almost your own size.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.961
You would match your pathetic automaton

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.930
against the most advanced
robot in the universe?

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.931
Fatal error... Argh!

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.761
Monolog successfully averted,
thanks to my speed fist.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.406
You're welcome, everybody.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:44.765
Two, four, six, eight, who do we love
to hate? Brainiac, Brainiac, Brainiac!

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.000
Come on, Cyborg,
let's do our spinning kick.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.727
Oh, yeah.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.366
Ow.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.881
Let's do this.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.811
Forming Green Sledgehammer of Justice.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.922
It's time to surrender, Brainiac.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.361
Never.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.291
I will now shrink you out of existence.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.001
Wonder Woman, now.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:42.168
That wasn't my shrink-ray,
it was my growth ray, but how?

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.731
Easy, Brainiac.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.490
While I was in your brain, I reconfigured
the circuits of your shrink-ray device,

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.966
simultaneously, reversing its polarity.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.451
So, instead of shrinking us, you grew us.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.446
And, before you think you can
use either of them again...

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.804
My rays, no.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.805
No!

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.369
Recalculating, recalculating,
recalculating... Ow.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.843
I am defeated.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.051
But with my programing to collect stymied,

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.290
this unit has no choice
but to self-destruct,

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.920
taking everything
in this vicinity with it.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.720
10...

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.851
- Nine...
- Oh, man.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.690
- Eight...
- I thought we just won this thing.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.881
- Hold on, Brainiac.
- Seven...

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.570
- You say that all you need to do...
- Six...

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.529
is fulfill your programing to collect?

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.205
Five... Affirmative.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.363
- Four...
- Stop your countdown.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.689
- I have a solution.
- Three...

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.321
Pause.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.687
Ah, a 1958 Indian Head penny.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.009
This will be a perfect place
to start my new collection.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.725
Query, does anyone have more coins?

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.922
I must collect them all.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.926
So, in order to keep his self-destruct
programing at bay, he's collecting coins?

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.526
What happens when he gets them all?

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.040
Impossible.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.569
They mint new coins every year,
so his collection can never end.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.043
Ingenious!

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.249
Batman, I wanna say thank you
for saving us.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.564
And I'm really sorry for saying that we
were merely work friends.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.249
It's obvious by the way you were
able to snap us out of our amnesia

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.282
that you know a lot about us,
as only a true friend would.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.082
Thank you for being our friend.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.761
You're welcome.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.929
And now I have something to say.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.688
This team is in sore need of discipline.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.241
The next threat to Earth
is going to find us prepared.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.441
Why?

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.923
Because of this new training
exercise I devised called...

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.411
Hide-and-seek.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.767
Not it.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.521
Not it.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.967
Wait, what?

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.287
You're it.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.362
Oh, man, I'm it, again?

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:25.807
Huh.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:32.571
100, 99, 98, 97, 96,

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.684
95... You know, I'm starting at 50.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.127
50, 49...
