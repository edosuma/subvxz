-[peppy music playing]
-[indistinct chattering]

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:36.083
I'm Betsy Ross.

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:39.500
I designed the first American Flag
in 1776.

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:42.541
But I didn't just say
what I thought the flag should look like,

01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:44.958
I listened to others
to see what they thought.

01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:47.583
The result was
the superior design we have today,

01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:49.208
and also, people liking me more.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.916
I'm Susan B. Anthony.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.500
I played a pivotal role
in the women's suffrage movement

01:06:54.583 --> 01:06:56.125
in the 19th century.

01:06:56.208 --> 01:06:59.416
But I'm not that special or great.
And neither is my family.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:03.625
So I can relate to average women
who couldn't vote until 1920.

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:06.916
I'm Winston Churchill.
"We shall fight on the beaches."

"We shall fight them
in the fields and in the streets."

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.083
"We shall never surrender,

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.833
but we shall let them down easy,
with a nice letter."

01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:16.666
-"So they don't lose their minds."
-This is wonderful.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:18.708
You've taught them life lessons.

01:07:18.791 --> 01:07:21.333

Can you open your pocket?

at the stake, but I am not afraid.

Boo-freaking-hoo! Everyone's got problems.

01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:32.541

What about the kids?

01:09:18.333 --> 01:09:22.125
They lost. The class
embarrassed themselves and blamed you.

What? What was all that cheering?

01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:27.791

of ever running into the children.

Or the principal. Or the media.
