00:01.126 --> 00:02.210
<i>I'm Harry Tasker,</i>

00:02.210 --> 00:05.088
<i>husband, dad, computer salesman,</i>

00:05.088 --> 00:08.383
<i>and for 17 years the most
important person in my life</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:09.926
<i>didn't know I was also something else.</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.346
<i>Omega Sector's top spy.</i>

00:13.346 --> 00:15.015
<i>I'm Helen Tasker,</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:16.975
<i>wife, mom and professor.</i>

00:16.975 --> 00:18.768
<i>After an unfortunate incident</i>

00:18.768 --> 00:21.187
<i>where I found out
our whole life was a lie,</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:23.648
<i>now I'm also a spy.</i>

00:24.816 --> 00:26.860
<i>Honey, all those things are true.</i>

00:26.860 --> 00:28.486
<i>They're just, you know...
What?</i>

00:28.486 --> 00:30.947
<i>True lies.</i>

00:39.622 --> 00:41.332
Mr. Madsen, welcome.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.834
I hope the flight was okay.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.502
- It was fine.
- Wonderful.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.129
You know, I have to tell you,

00:46.129 --> 00:48.256
we are all very excited
to discuss the deal proposal.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.799
There's no proposal yet.

00:49.799 --> 00:52.135
I'm here to see the facility for myself.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.261
This is my legal team.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.596
Oh, of course.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.389
We can't do anything without lawyers.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.599
Am I right?

00:59.726 --> 01:00.769
All right, let's get to it.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.604
This way, please.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.813
I think you'll be pleased

01:03.813 --> 01:05.398
with the meeting arrangements.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.525
We had lobsters flown in from Maine.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.194
We ate on the plane.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.112
We're here to do business.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.113
Well,

01:12.113 --> 01:14.074
Axe has been at the cutting edge

01:14.074 --> 01:16.326
of the defense industry since 1982.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.953
But that takes investors like yourselves.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.538
New tech isn't cheap.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.332
Hmm. We're more concerned

01:22.332 --> 01:23.792
with whether it's secure.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.293
Your designs aren't worth much

01:25.293 --> 01:26.336
if they can be knocked off

01:26.336 --> 01:27.545
in some foreign factory.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.506
Uh, not a concern.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.300
I'd be happy to show you
our security setup.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.843
Yes.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.137
I think that'd be a good idea.

01:38.556 --> 01:41.601
This is the nerve center
of our security setup.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.104
In an emergency, the entire system

01:44.104 --> 01:46.189
can be locked down.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.650
The locks can only be opened by myself

01:48.650 --> 01:50.944
or by senior security personnel.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.822
The system is effectively impenetrable.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.199
Is it, though?

02:06.668 --> 02:07.877
You're awfully squeamish

02:07.877 --> 02:09.712
for a guy that runs a weapons company.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.799
Lock the building down.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.008
You have five seconds.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.009
Please...

02:15.009 --> 02:16.719
One.

02:16.719 --> 02:17.929
Two.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.097
Three.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.765
One, two, three.

02:20.765 --> 02:25.395
And one, two, three.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.856
A-And one, two...

02:27.856 --> 02:29.607
Okay, I don't get the whole "and" thing.

02:29.607 --> 02:30.817
Is that on the beat or not?

02:30.817 --> 02:33.361
It's... Just-just follow me.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.196
- It's good.
- Okay. But aren't I
supposed to be leading?

02:35.196 --> 02:36.739
You are leading. I'm just helping.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.241
Well, how can I lead if you're helping?

02:38.241 --> 02:39.325
Let's just keep going.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.869
- Okay.
- Okay, okay, okay.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.412
And one,

02:42.412 --> 02:43.496
two, three.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.581
And one,

02:44.581 --> 02:45.790
two, three.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.083
And one, two, three.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.084
- And...
- And then spin this way.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.377
Whoa.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.920
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.297
- Why don't you...
- Okay.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.424
Why don't you lead
after you know all the steps?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.176
I know the steps,
it's just the whole "and" thing

02:56.176 --> 02:57.760
- that messes me up.
- Okay. All right.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.429
And...

02:59.429 --> 03:03.766
And one, two, three... Ow!

03:03.766 --> 03:04.976
Oh.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.936
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.313
Honey, maybe I'm just

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
not a salsa dancer.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.815
Okay, you're obviously

03:10.815 --> 03:12.400
not a salsa dancer yet.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.484
That's why we're learning.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.403
Why don't I take a lesson by myself first?

03:15.403 --> 03:17.071
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's how you

03:17.071 --> 03:18.865
learn couples dancing-- alone. Mm-hmm.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.242
I stepped on your foot.
Maybe I just don't want to hurt you.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.869
Or maybe you just
don't like people helping you, Harry.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.120
What are you talking about?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.830
I have people help me all the time.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.291
Gib at work. He mans the radio.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.502
That's not helping,
that's division of labor.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.379
I know you don't like people helping you,

03:33.379 --> 03:35.256
I know it makes you think
you're weak, Harry,

03:35.256 --> 03:37.342
but sometimes it can

03:37.342 --> 03:39.719
make new things possible.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.181
Wow, that is really inspirational.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.474
Did you get that off a bumper sticker?

03:44.474 --> 03:45.725
- Mm-hmm.
- That's nice.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.310
- Thank you.
- I just don't see

03:47.310 --> 03:48.937
how salsa dancing is...

03:48.937 --> 03:51.022
Ooh. That's Omega.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.106
Looks urgent.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.525
Can you try not looking so excited

03:54.525 --> 03:56.444
that there's a national emergency, Harry?

03:56.444 --> 03:58.821
That's Omega. Looks urgent.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.324
Okay, I bought that one.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.179
So, what's up with this briefing?

04:23.179 --> 04:25.098
We get an urgent message
and there's nobody here.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.433
Yeah, where's Gib?
Guess we have extra time

04:27.433 --> 04:28.810
to practice our salsa moves.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.061
- Oh, honey.
- Yeah.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.854
- I don't want to dance.
- Oh, I'm aware.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.524
Um... hello.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.151
I'm Quinn.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.070
From engineering. You never...

04:39.070 --> 04:40.947
Engineering. Why is someone

04:40.947 --> 04:42.532
- from engineering here?
- Okay.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.535
So, Gib is

04:45.535 --> 04:47.161
a little busy with Director Trilby,

04:47.161 --> 04:51.124
and there is an unfolding situation.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.334
We should start with the briefing video.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.919
Aha.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.546
She gets the remote?

05:00.341 --> 05:04.304
<i>At approximately
0940 hours Eastern Standard Time,</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:08.182
<i>Washington defense contractor
Axe Industries was attacked,</i>

05:08.182 --> 05:10.184
<i>with all 130 employees</i>

05:10.184 --> 05:11.978
<i>taken hostage within the building.</i>

05:11.978 --> 05:15.148
<i>It's time the merchants of death
at Axe Industries</i>

05:15.148 --> 05:17.817
<i>paid for the pain their weapons create.</i>

05:17.817 --> 05:21.154
<i>We demand reparations for their victims</i>

05:21.154 --> 05:23.031
<i>and the victims' families.</i>

05:23.031 --> 05:25.533
<i>$100 million.</i>

05:25.533 --> 05:27.243
<i>The leader has been ID'd</i>

05:27.243 --> 05:28.870
<i>as Lieutenant Victor Madsen,</i>

05:28.870 --> 05:31.497
<i>former Delta Force.</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:33.416
<i>Dishonorable discharge, 2016.</i>

05:33.416 --> 05:36.544
<i>He has indicated he will kill all hostages</i>

05:36.544 --> 05:39.380
<i>if his demands are not met in six hours.</i>

05:39.380 --> 05:41.799
<i></i>

05:41.799 --> 05:42.759
<i>Infiltrate.</i>

05:42.759 --> 05:44.135
<i>Neutralize threat.</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:47.013
<i>Rescue hostages.</i>

05:49.265 --> 05:51.601
So, that's happening, and...

05:51.601 --> 05:54.145
I still don't understand
why Gib isn't here

05:54.145 --> 05:56.481
and someone from engineering
is doing the briefing.

05:56.481 --> 06:00.401
Right. Well, it's kind
of a funny story, actually.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.988
Nope, it's not a funny story.
Sorry I lied.

06:03.988 --> 06:07.867
Axe Industries builds
some of Omega's tech.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.244
Oh! Uh, like the, um, the laser cutter.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.245
That thing's great.

06:11.245 --> 06:14.165
No. Uh, I mean, yes, it is great.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.458
But, no, I built that.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.667
- You did?
- Yeah.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.711
Axe does more weapony stuff.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.963
- Right.
- Yeah, um...

06:22.256 --> 06:23.841
Anyhoo,

06:23.841 --> 06:26.344
since Axe Industries
was founded by Gib's father

06:26.344 --> 06:28.262
and he designed the buildings himself...

06:28.262 --> 06:31.182
I'm sorry, time-out.
Did you say Gib's father?

06:31.182 --> 06:32.642
Gib has a father?

06:32.642 --> 06:33.893
Does he know about Omega?

06:33.893 --> 06:36.270
Does he know that Gib is a part of Omega?

06:36.270 --> 06:37.313
Yes?

06:38.147 --> 06:42.026
Uh, I'm sorry, I just assumed
that everyone knew.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.611
'Cause y'all are on the same team.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.531
But I guess I can see clearly
that you didn't know.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.951
So, Gib does not like the idea
of his father coming to help.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.454
And he and Director Trilby
were having a loud discussion.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.164
All right, maybe I should go talk to him.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.332
Yeah, yeah.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.378
Yeah, how long have you worked here?

07:00.378 --> 07:01.754
About seven years.
- Oh.
Wow.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.631
- Yeah.
- I feel bad.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.425
Not a chance! I won't do it!

07:05.425 --> 07:08.886
No, no. This is gonna be a disaster,

07:08.886 --> 07:10.555
okay? You understand?

07:10.555 --> 07:11.848
There-there has to be another way, Harry.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.391
Okay, can we just...

07:13.391 --> 07:15.393
...take a breath,

07:15.393 --> 07:17.603
slow down for a second?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.147
How did I not know about your dad?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.815
Because we don't speak, okay?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.316
You understand? And then,

07:22.316 --> 07:23.734
when we do speak, whoo, no,

07:23.734 --> 07:25.153
it doesn't go well.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.280
You talked like he was dead.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.907
And then I find out that
he used to work with Omega?

07:29.907 --> 07:31.409
Yeah, he had Omega level clearance

07:31.409 --> 07:34.120
because he built stuff for us
through his company. Okay?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.581
So, yeah, Harry, I'm the one guy here

07:36.581 --> 07:38.666
who has a family member
that knows that he's here.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.917
Does that make you happy?

07:39.917 --> 07:41.419
Yes, it makes me happy, and I think

07:41.419 --> 07:42.962
- it would make him happy.
- You would think!

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
But all he wanted was for me

07:44.547 --> 07:46.757
to take over his company after he retired.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.969
And then, when I joined Omega,
ooh-hoo-hoo! Whoa,

07:49.969 --> 07:51.137
Al went ballistic.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.972
Okay, Gib...

07:52.972 --> 07:54.724
Wait a minute, you call your dad Al?

07:54.724 --> 07:56.017
Well, that's his name.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.353
Look, the point is he just wants

07:59.353 --> 08:01.439
a miniature version of himself, okay?

08:01.439 --> 08:03.566
And I was not about to be Mini-Me'd.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.860
Gib, I hear you, but there are

08:05.860 --> 08:07.695
a lot of hostages in that building

08:07.695 --> 08:09.530
that the FBI can't find a way in.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.157
You just don't get how he is, Harry.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.993
You got to see it for yourself.
You just don't get it.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.412
Gib, I think I can help.
I was eavesdropping.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.956
This is about communication.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.500
I'm a linguistics professor.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.876
Speak a lot of languages.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.836
If I can speak pidgin Russian,

08:23.836 --> 08:25.254
I'm pretty sure I can speak father-son.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.133
Hey,

08:29.133 --> 08:31.636
I think it's worth giving it a shot.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.305
Plus, this is a direct order
from the chief.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.432
Gib.

08:36.432 --> 08:40.061
It's gonna be fine. Dads love me.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.524
I don't think this is a good idea.
Maybe if you

08:44.524 --> 08:46.567
just let us tell you a little more
about the situation...

08:46.567 --> 08:48.528
Young lady, I don't
believe I was speaking to you.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.782
All I know is my son,
who couldn't be bothered

08:52.782 --> 08:55.368
to so much as call in a decade,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.703
shows up at my doorstep wanting my help.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.288
Wasn't my idea, Al.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.873
I believe that.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.542
Mr. Gibson, if I may,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.168
we have nowhere else to turn.

09:04.168 --> 09:07.505
There are 130 hostages
trapped inside Axe Industries.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.465
Axe Industries?

09:09.465 --> 09:11.968
Are you serious?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.220
<i>$100 million.</i>

09:14.220 --> 09:17.014
This shouldn't even be possible.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.476
That idiot who runs the place now--

09:20.476 --> 09:22.395
he do something stupid?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.521
We don't know how it happened,

09:23.521 --> 09:25.439
but what we do know
is we need to get in there.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.817
The only people besides you
who know the building

09:27.817 --> 09:30.111
well enough to help
are inside as hostages.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.197
Wouldn't be in this situation
if Junior here had taken over.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.866
Instead of becoming a government worker.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.535
Okay, here we go.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.161
Omega isn't exactly the post office, Al.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.788
And the post office isn't here

09:40.788 --> 09:42.164
asking me for help with the mail.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.292
Okay, setting that aside
for just a moment,

09:44.292 --> 09:46.586
can you get us in?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.212
Omega logistics looked at the designs

09:48.212 --> 09:49.380
and didn't see a way to penetrate.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.173
I can get us in. Oh.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.134
I mean, I designed
the damn building, didn't I?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.678
Yes. It's that easy?

09:55.678 --> 09:57.888
Easy? No.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.725
A maze of utility tunnels
leads to the basement level,

10:00.725 --> 10:02.727
which gives us access
to the rest of the building,

10:02.727 --> 10:04.645
which they probably don't know.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.772
Now, I've spent a lot of time down there.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.482
Do you think we can make it through?

10:08.482 --> 10:10.735
Eh...

10:10.735 --> 10:12.236
Not without me.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.875
<i>All right.
So I guess that, over my objection,</i>

10:25.875 --> 10:29.462
<i>we're gonna do this,
which I still think is a bad idea.</i>

10:31.130 --> 10:33.341
<i>But apparently this is the mission.</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:38.137
<i>Okay, let's go over the basics
of the situation.</i>

10:38.137 --> 10:40.306
Because Axe works on top secret projects

10:40.306 --> 10:42.099
and it's in the middle of nowhere,

10:42.099 --> 10:44.268
we've got the press locked down,

10:44.268 --> 10:45.603
but it won't stay that way long.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.063
Top-level FBI knows that we're here.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.106
I asked them
to settle this thing peacefully

10:49.106 --> 10:50.191
while we infiltrate.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.151
The utility tunnels lead to the basement.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.654
The central workspace is one level up.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.197
That's where the hostages will be.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.699
Now, if you can get there,
then you can neutralize

10:58.699 --> 10:59.784
any guards that...

10:59.909 --> 11:00.951
Not your part of the mission, Al.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.119
Once we infiltrate...

11:02.119 --> 11:03.746
So you really don't
want me to help, do you?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.247
- As I thought...
- I need help on the tunnels.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.415
Okay? I can run the team.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.458
Okay, let's just take a breath.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.168
Everybody has something to offer.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.253
You have tactics and you have tunnels.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.798
Very exciting. Kind of like
the chocolate and peanut butter

11:13.798 --> 11:15.049
of hostage rescue.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.179
The team will neutralize
any guards and free the hostages.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.723
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.071
Are you seriously in portrait?

11:37.071 --> 11:39.281
Landscape, please.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.785
I just got word.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.829
Madsen's team has been setting up

11:44.829 --> 11:46.288
Axe weapons systems on the roof.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.126
They're sending over
another video message here.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.379
<i>We have received the FBI's generous offer</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:55.506
<i>of pizza for the hostages</i>

11:55.506 --> 11:57.341
and the opportunity to surrender.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.635
This is our counteroffer.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.442
Gib, we need to get in there, now.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.993
<i>♪ Oh, look around ♪</i>

12:23.993 --> 12:25.911
<i>♪ Something's going ♪</i>

12:25.911 --> 12:28.456
<i>♪ Down ♪</i>

12:34.628 --> 12:36.714
<i>♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪</i>

12:42.344 --> 12:44.764
<i>♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom. ♪</i>

12:44.764 --> 12:47.099
Okay, before we go down there,

12:47.099 --> 12:48.768
we need to do an engineering review.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.436
Engineering review? What?

12:50.436 --> 12:51.771
So everyone knows what's down there.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.355
I can do a quick diagram.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.065
Do you understand
what we're doing here, Al?

12:55.065 --> 12:56.776
There is a hostage situation.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.402
Nobody has time...

12:58.402 --> 13:00.529
Doing things right is always quicker

13:00.529 --> 13:01.947
<i>than doing them twice.</i>

13:01.947 --> 13:03.532
You think you can keep them
from killing each other?

13:03.532 --> 13:05.534
I'll do my best. Also, just curious,

13:05.534 --> 13:07.286
is sneaking into a hostage situation

13:07.286 --> 13:09.121
through a maze of deadly utility tunnels

13:09.121 --> 13:10.664
really better than
letting me help you learn salsa?

13:10.664 --> 13:12.750
Honestly?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.085
About a 60-40 in favor
of the hostage crisis.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.254
Okay, even so, be careful.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.508
This is not you lecturing me

13:20.508 --> 13:23.260
on doing my calculus homework
when I was nine years old.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.221
Why did you bring me here
if you're not gonna listen

13:25.221 --> 13:27.431
to a damn word I say?

13:27.431 --> 13:28.641
I-I don't-I don't understand it.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.392
Okay, everybody calm down.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.645
Let's just discuss this.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.208
Hey, you okay?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.168
I'm fine.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.003
So, that's your "I'm fine" shudder?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.218
I just know you get
claustrophobic sometimes.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.845
What are you talking about?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.222
You told me in the hotel in Perth,

14:08.222 --> 14:09.974
when we were dating.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.892
And you're using it against me.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.519
How is that against you?

14:13.519 --> 14:14.979
Uh, I told you that in a moment of...

14:16.063 --> 14:17.731
A private moment.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.650
Things were different.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.360
I'm just saying, if you're afraid

14:21.360 --> 14:22.862
of small, dark spaces...

14:22.862 --> 14:24.572
I am not afraid of small, dark spaces.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.865
I love small, dark spaces.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.449
I'm very happy right now.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.248
Hey, Gib, we got a tunnel
going left and right.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.749
Which way do we go?

14:35.749 --> 14:37.459
I'm just saying,
if we'd done an engineering review...

14:37.459 --> 14:39.503
Al, I'm trying to direct the team, okay?

14:39.503 --> 14:41.630
Guys, please. What?

14:41.630 --> 14:43.257
All right, let's just
get through this, okay?

14:43.257 --> 14:44.967
Where are they going
and what are they watching for?

14:44.967 --> 14:47.887
Sorry, Harry. Uh, you're gonna
make a right, then a quick left.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.222
There's a power line
right next to a gas line.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.640
Don't touch the wire.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.100
Thank you.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.977
<i>Guys?</i>

14:54.977 --> 14:56.312
Gib, Al?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.230
Just remember we
have a building full of hostages

14:58.230 --> 15:00.566
that are depending on us, so...

15:00.566 --> 15:03.068
Yeah, let's get along, okay?

15:03.068 --> 15:05.321
That's what I've been telling them, Harry.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.033
We don't have that kind of time.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.410
You're not listening to me. Please,

15:11.410 --> 15:13.913
just talk to the board of directors.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.206
- What do we got?
- Um,

15:16.206 --> 15:19.585
the FBI negotiator says it's impossible.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.254
$100 million is too much.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.631
Aah!

15:23.631 --> 15:25.883
I suggest you try harder.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.766
Hello? Yes, it's me!

15:33.766 --> 15:36.185
We need to figure something out here.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.229
Keep him talking.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.606
And if he gives up?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.943
Kill him.
Put one of the other suits on it.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.611
We need to keep the feds
talking long enough

15:45.611 --> 15:47.655
for us to finish our real business here.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.740
I'm going downstairs.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.665
Okay.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.167
Now, in about 50 feet,

16:00.167 --> 16:03.462
you're gonna take
the passage on your right.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.089
Ah.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.007
Look, if they travel south,
along this east wall,

16:07.007 --> 16:08.676
they'll get there.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.763
All right. All right, you're gonna
want to continue

16:12.763 --> 16:14.390
till you see a fire ladder leading to

16:14.390 --> 16:15.474
an overhead grate.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.017
Should be across from a door.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.686
- Yeah, found it.
- Great.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.104
Okay, good. Now, you're gonna want to go

16:20.104 --> 16:21.730
up that ladder and through the grate.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.024
The two pipes leading up are just...

16:24.024 --> 16:26.819
Two pipes? I see three.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.153
I thought you said you know

16:28.153 --> 16:29.613
everything there is to know
about these tunnels.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.657
I do. There shouldn't be a third.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.826
We need to follow it
back to see where it came from.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.452
Follow it back?
We don't have time for that.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.329
Okay, what if we slow down
and work together...

16:37.329 --> 16:39.164
Talk to Junior here.
Why did he bring me here

16:39.164 --> 16:40.624
- if he's not gonna listen?
- All right! That's it!

16:40.624 --> 16:42.960
I'm not listening
because we got a job to do

16:42.960 --> 16:45.045
and you want to follow pipes.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.007
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.341
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.426
Come on. Seriously?

16:50.426 --> 16:51.510
I can't even offer

16:51.510 --> 16:52.636
comfort to a colleague?

16:52.636 --> 16:54.555
Your colleague is fine.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.682
I don't see you
patting Harry on the shoulder.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.728
That's different. Harry's... Harry.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.438
It's important! As an engineer,

17:02.438 --> 17:04.273
- you got to find the source.
- Okay, the engineer talk.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.066
You had a full scholarship to MIT.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.192
Perhaps if you had accepted it

17:07.192 --> 17:08.902
- you'd understand.
- Oh, I understand.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.029
I understand. I understand

17:10.029 --> 17:11.155
that you were not gonna be satisfied

17:11.155 --> 17:12.781
unless I did every little thing

17:12.781 --> 17:13.907
you wanted me to, Al.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.409
Helen, what's going on? Should we go up?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.202
I'm trying to find out.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.537
Is that the passageway or is it not?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.164
Yes, it is, but something's changed.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.165
What choice do we have?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.167
They didn't build another tunnel.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.668
Obviously not,
but if they put something new here,

17:24.668 --> 17:26.003
they did it for a reason.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.796
And they did it secretly

17:27.796 --> 17:29.339
because there's nothing here
in the building codes.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.050
We're not talking about
the building codes, okay?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.384
And we're not turning them around.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.303
All right, we need to move here.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.804
Let me see that laser cutter.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.865
Harry, the whole thing's coming down!

17:54.865 --> 17:56.450
Aah!

17:57.493 --> 17:58.744
Harry, hurry!

18:00.162 --> 18:01.747
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- What's happening?
- It's Harry.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.540
Some kind of gas pipe broke.
It got in his eyes.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.504
<i>What was that? Was that an explosion?</i>

18:08.504 --> 18:10.506
Yes, that was an explosion.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.548
<i>What's exploding?</i>

18:11.548 --> 18:12.925
Is Harry okay?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.259
I'm-I'm checking. Hang on.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.594
Luther, talk to me, buddy.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.679
Is he burned? How's his breathing?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.139
I-I don't see any burns.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.892
Harry, sweetheart, talk to me.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.519
Are you all right? Are you okay?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.728
Helen...

18:24.728 --> 18:27.189
I can't see.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.363
<i>Harry, what do you mean, you can't see?</i>

18:34.363 --> 18:35.572
You see? You see what happens?

18:35.572 --> 18:36.865
I was trying to tell you.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.075
Okay, just let me talk to him.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.202
Stop, let me talk to him. Harry.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.329
Helen, it's gonna be okay.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.414
It's not gonna be okay unless you're okay.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.876
<i>What was that? Are you guys okay?</i>

18:47.876 --> 18:50.546
<i>Luther, Maria,
report back, please. Status.</i>

18:50.546 --> 18:52.172
We're okay. The door's holding.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.715
For now.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.467
How's that?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.511
Feels like you're trying
to put a fire out with molten lava.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.013
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.265
- It's better.
- Yeah?

19:01.265 --> 19:02.516
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Harry, wait.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.684
It's getting better. It's clearing up.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.602
Harry? Just... no.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.312
Let's sit down for a sec, please.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.189
Right there. Right there.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.984
Hi, guys?
Any word on what was in that pipe?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.111
'Cause it does not seem good.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.362
Patching you through to engineering.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.989
Hold on.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.073
<i>Go for engineering.</i>

19:18.073 --> 19:19.366
Hello? Can you hear me?

19:19.366 --> 19:20.909
<i>We're here. Talk to us.</i>

19:20.909 --> 19:22.619
We're analyzing some possibilities now.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.329
Can you give me a color or a smell?

19:24.329 --> 19:25.372
It was white.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.373
Harry, what did it smell like?

19:26.373 --> 19:27.833
Limes, sort of?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.751
Okay, sounds like an alkali precursor

19:29.751 --> 19:31.587
for some sort of industrial process.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.006
Good news is the blindness
is probably temporary.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.008
Bad news is the smoke, it...

19:36.008 --> 19:38.135
What about the smoke?

19:38.135 --> 19:41.221
It's toxic. Just, like, bad toxic.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.098
Is there a good toxic?

19:43.098 --> 19:45.142
Uh, Gib, where do we go now?

19:45.142 --> 19:46.727
I'm working on that right now.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.229
Luther, Maria, go down the hall

19:49.229 --> 19:51.023
200 feet.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.567
All right, big guy.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.527
Oh, you're patting me now?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.821
What? It's just a shoulder pat.

19:57.821 --> 19:59.114
It's a comforting gesture.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.243
You guys mouthing about me?

20:03.243 --> 20:04.953
- No. What? No.
- What? No. What are you talking about?

20:04.953 --> 20:06.788
Can they continue
down that hall or are we gonna

20:06.788 --> 20:08.332
lead them into another toxic explosion?

20:08.332 --> 20:10.250
That was not my fault.
I'm the one who was trying to

20:10.250 --> 20:11.668
figure out what the damn pipe was.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.295
Maybe if you hadn't been in such a hurry,

20:13.295 --> 20:14.796
then we might have
figured this out by now.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.340
I'm in a hurry because
there's a hostage situation

20:16.340 --> 20:18.467
- going on, Al. Keep up.
- Okay, stop it! Stop it.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.510
Stop it. Both of you, stop it. Al,

20:20.510 --> 20:22.179
you were right. We needed to know what was

20:22.179 --> 20:23.472
in the pipes. Gib, you were also right.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.806
We're in a hurry.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.642
But the fact is you guys
are spending so much time

20:26.642 --> 20:28.560
trying to be right that
you're not listening to each other,

20:28.560 --> 20:30.437
and now Harry can't see.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.445
I'll get into the security system at Axe,

20:38.445 --> 20:41.365
make sure the bad guys
don't find out about this tunnel fire.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.367
Thank you.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.702
What do you think they put down there?

20:45.702 --> 20:46.828
I don't know.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.372
But with that much toxic chemical

20:48.372 --> 20:50.374
being piped into the basement?

20:50.374 --> 20:52.292
It's nothing good.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.632
What's the status up there?

20:58.632 --> 21:01.551
Had a fire alarm go off,
but it shut down now.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.845
Keep an eye on that. Anything else?

21:03.845 --> 21:05.889
Well, the FBI stopped negotiating.

21:05.889 --> 21:07.599
Said our demands weren't serious.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.976
We can't let them send in a team

21:08.976 --> 21:10.769
while we're breaking into the lab.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.062
Fire a missile.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.397
That doesn't get 'em talking again,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.065
kill a hostage.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.572
Gib, what is going on up there?

21:22.572 --> 21:23.991
<i>They're lobbing missiles at the FBI.</i>

21:23.991 --> 21:26.285
We got lucky that time. No one was hurt.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.869
Look, guys, we got to get a move on

21:27.869 --> 21:29.329
if we want to keep this thing under wraps.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.164
Things are getting hairy out there.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.041
Yeah, well, they're
getting pretty hairy down here, too.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.091
How we coming on a way out?

21:41.091 --> 21:43.093
Not great. Gib, I got some kind of

21:43.093 --> 21:44.928
a fire door down here,
but we can't get through.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.346
I see it. You can't open it?

21:46.346 --> 21:47.848
No, not from this side.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.016
I got a couple of shape charges,

21:49.016 --> 21:52.269
but the only cover in here is in the fire.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.188
There's no way out.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.440
Not on the blueprints, Junior.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.400
The tunnels down there run in parallel,

21:58.400 --> 21:59.776
connected by ducts.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.737
If we can get someone
to crawl through this tunnel,

22:01.737 --> 22:03.196
they can crawl through the duct,

22:03.196 --> 22:05.115
double back, and open that door.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.783
All right. How big is this crawl space?

22:06.783 --> 22:08.493
Two and a half foot square, maybe,

22:08.493 --> 22:10.787
and can hold only 150 pounds at most.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.748
Great. Well, that leaves me.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.207
You're more than 150 pounds

22:14.207 --> 22:15.751
and so are you.
We don't have another choice.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.756
Okay. Okay, Helen. Okay.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.924
Now, we don't know
what other hazards and dangers

22:22.924 --> 22:25.761
might be down there, okay? Be careful.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.846
- Uh, there's toxic smoke.
- Exactly.

22:27.846 --> 22:28.972
Which means they could all die.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.017
And I'm not gonna let that happen.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.816
<i>All right, Helen, you in?</i>

22:39.816 --> 22:42.569
Yeah, I'm in.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.488
<i>Okay, you're gonna go down that tunnel</i>

22:44.488 --> 22:45.822
<i>another 100 feet.</i>

22:45.822 --> 22:47.657
Ugh! Okay, all right.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.868
Oh! It's spooky in here.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.662
Okay, I need you guys to talk to me.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.539
Talk to you?

22:54.539 --> 22:55.832
Yeah, talk to me. Keep me company.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.834
Tell me about the two of you.

22:57.834 --> 23:01.004
Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.256
Oh, I think it is. Just consider me your

23:03.256 --> 23:04.257
"not taking no for an answer"

23:04.257 --> 23:06.760
personal mediator. And go.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.970
Helen, we can't do family therapy

23:08.970 --> 23:10.222
in the middle of a mission, okay?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.973
Gib, just talk, okay?

23:11.973 --> 23:13.558
It can't have always been like this.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.478
Just, when's the last time
the two of you got along?

23:22.234 --> 23:23.944
When I was a kid.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.155
Uh, after my mom died.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.991
You know, making Legos, stuff like that.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.202
<i>Okay, Al, do you remember that?</i>

23:32.202 --> 23:34.121
Yeah.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.123
<i>And how did that make you feel?</i>

23:36.123 --> 23:38.375
How do you think it made me feel?

23:38.375 --> 23:41.586
Things were rough after Rhonda passed.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.673
But... we were making it.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.095
Though, uh...

23:50.095 --> 23:52.639
things changed after
middle school, though.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.768
He wouldn't call me Dad anymore.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.061
Started calling me Al.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.064
That's just because
you only called me Junior.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.524
You did not want a son,

24:02.524 --> 24:04.443
you wanted a younger version of you.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.403
Okay, this is just
a conversation, you guys.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.406
Everyone's gonna
be seen and heard, all right?

24:09.406 --> 24:12.451
And which way do I turn at the fork?

24:12.451 --> 24:15.370
- Left.
- Watch the power lines.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.580
Yes.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.874
Don't die, don't die, don't die.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.126
<i>Okay, Helen, coming up on your right</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:22.502
<i>is another hallway.</i>

24:22.502 --> 24:24.504
<i>As soon as you make that right-hand turn,</i>

24:24.504 --> 24:26.590
<i>you're gonna have to
cross over a set of pipes.</i>

24:26.590 --> 24:29.176
Okay, I'm going over the pipes.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.470
All right, the utility duct
that connects the tunnels

24:31.470 --> 24:33.054
is gonna be up ahead on your right.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.097
All right, let's go deeper.

24:34.097 --> 24:37.392
Wait, it goes down? It shouldn't.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.227
<i>Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't mean deeper</i>

24:39.227 --> 24:40.979
in the tunnels,
I mean deeper in the conversation.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.522
Let's talk about your mom.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.733
You recognize that you're
not actually a therapist, right?

24:44.733 --> 24:46.234
Oh, believe me, if there was a therapist

24:46.234 --> 24:48.487
<i>in the van, I would gladly
let him take over.</i>

24:48.487 --> 24:51.698
All I know is after she passed,
all I wanted was

24:51.698 --> 24:52.949
to be a father to the boy.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.952
Be a father. Yeah, okay, all right.

24:55.952 --> 24:57.329
You were gone.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.373
Work's the only thing
you ever really cared about.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.708
Is that what you thought?

25:03.168 --> 25:06.296
Who do you think
I built Axe Industries for?

25:07.297 --> 25:09.841
I built Axe-- every weapon, every gizmo--

25:09.841 --> 25:11.426
to protect you.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.220
To hand something off to you

25:13.220 --> 25:15.514
that no one could take away.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.224
And then you ran off to join Omega.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.019
Axe and Omega work together.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.813
I joined because I thought
you'd be proud of me for once.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.899
I was always proud of you.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.278
The proudest moment of my life...

25:31.947 --> 25:34.199
...was when your mama said to me

25:34.199 --> 25:37.077
that she trusted me to raise you.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.329
And then you sign up
to get yourself shot at

25:39.329 --> 25:41.581
or blown up,

25:41.581 --> 25:43.333
when all I did was promise her

25:43.333 --> 25:44.834
that I would keep you safe.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.087
Okay, and that sounds like progress,

25:47.087 --> 25:48.880
but to be continued.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.383
- I'm at the duct.
- Right. Right.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.135
Uh, pull off the grate.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.776
<i>You should see a power cable
running above you.</i>

26:09.776 --> 26:11.528
Yeah, I see two.

26:11.528 --> 26:17.117
There's a big one--
it's buzzing and it's hot.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.077
Oh, goody. Another surprise.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.621
Helen, hey,
just try not to touch it, okay?

26:21.621 --> 26:23.540
Last time we found
something new, it exploded.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.208
Okay, too late for that.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.918
That duct's gonna lead over to a tunnel

26:26.918 --> 26:28.295
where the team's at.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.297
Okay.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.925
Extra pipe, extra cable.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.844
Look, I... I don't like this.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.096
It sounds like Axe has built something new

26:38.096 --> 26:39.598
in the basement,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.224
something they didn't
want anyone to know about.

26:42.475 --> 26:44.311
What's the ETA on Helen?

26:44.311 --> 26:46.730
It's getting pretty uncomfortable in here.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.607
I hear you, buddy, just hang on.
Any minute now.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.656
Guys, I'm here. It's stuck!

26:57.324 --> 26:59.242
<i>Luther, what was that?</i>

26:59.242 --> 27:00.410
This way.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.871
<i>- Guys.</i>
- Helen's here, Gib, we're good.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.539
Helen!

27:04.539 --> 27:06.166
Yeah, I'm fine. It's okay.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.334
Yeah, but you can't see.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.211
Well, yeah, I can't,
but other than that...

27:10.211 --> 27:11.755
Okay, guys, you got to keep moving.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.965
- Where to?
- A hundred feet up. Take a right.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.717
Then on the left will be a staircase

27:15.717 --> 27:17.344
leading down to the lower level of Axe.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.845
Okay, let's go.

27:18.845 --> 27:19.888
Okay, okay.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.272
Hey, this way.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.649
Helen, I can do this myself.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.525
Harry, you have to let me help you.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.444
This is about keeping you alive, okay?

27:34.444 --> 27:37.197
I would very much like a live husband.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.740
Okay. Okay.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.283
I need to talk to you.

27:40.283 --> 27:42.786
Listen, I-I know we
both got a lot to process,

27:42.786 --> 27:45.246
- but the mission is...
- It's about the mission.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.292
Once we get into the basement,

27:49.292 --> 27:51.503
we got to find out
what's going on down there.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.380
We're here for the hostages.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.423
You really think
those maniacs took hostages

27:55.423 --> 27:57.258
because they believe in helping people?

27:57.258 --> 28:00.637
No. No, I don't.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.889
Axe built something bad in that basement

28:02.889 --> 28:04.641
and now this happens?

28:04.641 --> 28:06.935
I don't believe in coincidences.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.521
Now, I know,
I-I know we've had our issues.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.024
But I'm asking you, please.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.321
All right, y'all, listen up.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.781
Looks like there may be something going on

28:19.781 --> 28:21.700
in the basement that we don't know about.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.493
We need to check it out
before you head upstairs.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.953
You sure?

28:24.953 --> 28:27.872
I-I have an engineer here
that's telling me

28:27.997 --> 28:29.249
we need to check out the basement, okay?

28:29.249 --> 28:31.334
And I am inclined to trust him.

28:31.334 --> 28:34.504
So make it quick and keep your eyes open.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.464
Keep my eyes open? Thanks a lot, Gib.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.342
My bad, Harry,
that-that's just a figure of speech.

28:39.342 --> 28:42.011
I didn't mean... you know.

28:42.011 --> 28:43.221
You can usually see.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.781
<i>Maria, Luther, what are you guys seeing?</i>

29:01.781 --> 29:04.492
They're bringing a hostage down.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.578
Gib, all the bad guys are here.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.079
- All of 'em?
- Yeah.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.748
And there's no way
we can take out that many

29:09.748 --> 29:11.708
with just the three of us
and Harry out of commission.

29:11.708 --> 29:12.917
Luther, what are they doing?

29:12.917 --> 29:14.335
There's some sort of secret lab down here.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.795
It looks like they broke in.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.424
It looks like the engineer was right.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.051
They're doing something with the hostage.

29:26.306 --> 29:30.143
Please, I'll get the money. All right?

29:30.143 --> 29:33.897
- Let's just go back upstairs and-and...
- No need.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.815
You already did your job.

29:35.815 --> 29:38.777
Kept the FBI spinning its wheels.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.653
Just need one more thing from you.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.533
Open those pretty eyes of yours.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.505
Helen, what's happening?

29:58.505 --> 30:00.298
There's bad guys, and they have

30:00.298 --> 30:03.218
vials and canisters
of some sort of yellow liquid.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.137
Nerve gas.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.848
The hidden lab, the-the gas in the pipe,

30:08.848 --> 30:10.099
the extra power.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.518
It's the only thing that makes sense.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.728
But why would they be making nerve gas?

30:13.728 --> 30:15.522
Profit.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.565
After I left,

30:17.565 --> 30:19.150
Axe became all about the money.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.944
They started making
anything they could sell,

30:20.944 --> 30:22.987
and they would sell to anyone.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.280
Cheers.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.241
You're making a big mistake.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.117
This-this is just a failed experiment.

30:28.117 --> 30:30.662
- Failed? Really?
- Mm.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.336
No! No!

30:38.336 --> 30:41.714
Please, no!

30:41.714 --> 30:45.093
No! Please, please let me out.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.219
I'll get you your money.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.897
I'd call it quite a success.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.441
Let's load it up.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.235
Once we get upstairs, we gas the hostages,

31:02.235 --> 31:03.236
we gas the Feds.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.988
We kill 'em all.

31:04.988 --> 31:09.284
Buyer's chopper pulls us out
and we get paid, boys.

31:24.632 --> 31:26.718
Guys, we got to get in there now.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.844
Even if we save the hostages,

31:27.844 --> 31:29.304
we'll all be dead as soon as they get

31:29.304 --> 31:30.305
that nerve gas upstairs.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.223
Okay, well, what are we supposed to do?

31:32.223 --> 31:33.349
We can't start shooting in there,

31:33.349 --> 31:34.642
or we'll nerve gas the whole building.

31:34.642 --> 31:35.810
Well, we can't just stay here.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.395
Trying to figure something out, guys.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.272
Junior, you have to know
this is not the same

31:39.272 --> 31:40.648
Axe Industries that I built.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.567
I know we've got our issues,
Al, but you're not

31:42.567 --> 31:43.776
a nerve gas kind of guy.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.154
I mean, but my life's work, all crumbling.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.781
It's not gonna crumble.

31:48.781 --> 31:51.034
Not if I got anything to say about it.

31:51.034 --> 31:54.037
Guys, looks like they're on the move.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.999
What's wrong?

31:57.999 --> 32:00.001
These people might die
and I can't do anything about it

32:00.001 --> 32:01.294
because I can't see.

32:01.294 --> 32:04.213
Just wait, what if...
what if no one can see?

32:05.423 --> 32:06.883
What? What are you talking about?

32:06.883 --> 32:08.801
- Yeah, that doesn't sound great.
- Just, wait, listen.

32:08.801 --> 32:11.596
What... We can't shoot in there, right?

32:11.596 --> 32:12.931
But neither can they.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.098
So what if we cut the power

32:14.098 --> 32:15.892
and then fight them hand to hand?

32:15.892 --> 32:17.894
How many guys are in there?

32:17.894 --> 32:19.938
I think six or something,
plus the main guy.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.022
And I have my night-vision goggles,

32:21.022 --> 32:23.149
- so I can help you.
- Helen...

32:23.149 --> 32:25.276
Remember when I said
that letting people help you

32:25.276 --> 32:26.319
makes new things possible?

32:26.319 --> 32:27.862
Yeah, that was about salsa dancing.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.113
It's about fighting people in the dark

32:29.113 --> 32:30.365
with nerve gas, too, Harry.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.785
All right. All right, Gib,

32:33.785 --> 32:35.620
looks like Helen's gonna help me out.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.831
Okay! Okay, I like it. I like it.

32:38.831 --> 32:39.999
How do we kill power in there?

32:39.999 --> 32:41.709
The same crawl space
that Helen went through.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.836
- That's the power main.
- Got it.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.589
Luther, you still have
those explosive charges, correct?

32:46.589 --> 32:47.966
- Right here.
- Great.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.052
Okay, take Maria.
Head back down that hall. Go.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.943
Okay, the panel's
gonna be up on your left.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.361
On your left, Luther.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.446
<i>You're gonna need to boost Maria up.</i>

33:10.446 --> 33:13.616
Wait, wait, wait, wait... Uh, me?

33:13.616 --> 33:15.493
The space is only two and a half feet wide

33:15.493 --> 33:17.328
<i>and has 150-pound capacity.</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:19.664
<i>Luther's too heavy. That's our only move.</i>

33:19.664 --> 33:22.709
Wait, right, because it's only
a couple of feet wide. That's...

33:22.709 --> 33:25.003
- We could...
- Turn it off.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.629
Listen,

33:26.629 --> 33:28.881
you saw Harry and Helen back there

33:28.881 --> 33:30.633
helping each other?

33:30.633 --> 33:31.801
You got to let me help you

33:31.801 --> 33:33.803
through this claustrophobia thing.

33:33.803 --> 33:35.930
- It's different. They're married.
- Yes.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.141
But they're also operatives on a team,

33:38.141 --> 33:39.308
just like you and me.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.353
Let me help you through this

33:42.353 --> 33:45.148
and I will never bring it up again.

33:47.066 --> 33:48.359
You promise?

33:48.359 --> 33:50.445
I promise.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.406
All right.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.786
You got this.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.716
Okay, okay, okay.

34:16.345 --> 34:19.265
You got this.
You got this. I'm not going anywhere.

34:19.265 --> 34:21.350
- I'm right here.
- I can't breathe.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.935
So, what you want to do is you want to...

34:22.935 --> 34:24.020
It's adhesive,

34:24.020 --> 34:25.646
so you're just gonna
stick it to the wires.

34:25.646 --> 34:27.523
I'm sorry, are you mansplaining to me

34:27.523 --> 34:28.733
how to set this?

34:28.733 --> 34:30.985
Are you thinking about
your claustrophobia?

34:30.985 --> 34:33.279
I'm thinking about
the fact that you're mansplaining

34:33.279 --> 34:34.864
and my claustrophobia

34:34.864 --> 34:36.991
and I hate both of those things, okay?

34:36.991 --> 34:38.159
Maybe that'll make you do it faster

34:38.159 --> 34:39.452
and then we can get out of here.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.162
Okay, very funny.

34:41.162 --> 34:42.955
Love your jokes, Luther.

34:42.955 --> 34:44.248
You're doing great.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.168
How to set a detonator. Watch out.

34:50.171 --> 34:52.006
- That was great.
- Okay.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.634
- Ready?
- Yeah.

34:54.634 --> 34:55.927
Go!

35:00.056 --> 35:01.349
Power's down. Go now.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.351
Hey, what happened to the lights?

35:03.351 --> 35:05.144
The guy in front of you--
choke him, choke him.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.105
<i>♪ Get ready for a new ride ♪</i>

35:07.105 --> 35:08.272

I meant my left, your right. I'm so sorry.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.450
Two steps, swerve and kick.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.660
And forward.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.099
Is that all of 'em?

35:44.308 --> 35:46.894
No. The main guy, he went out the door.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.521
Gib, we can't get any more
with Harry like this.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.606
Yeah, Gib, we took out his guys.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.233
He won't make it back to the hostages,

35:52.233 --> 35:53.693
but he will try to escape.

35:53.693 --> 35:56.112
The closest emergency exits
are east and south,

35:56.112 --> 35:57.405
if you're still in the security system.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.365
Then I can see where he's heading. On it.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.369
He's heading toward the east side door.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.787
Head back up the way we came.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.581
Okay, Dad. Just tell me where I'm going.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.209
Did you just call me Dad?

36:10.209 --> 36:12.378
Yeah.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.005
Yeah, I guess I did.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.382
Buckle up.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.555
Freeze! Freeze! Drop your weapon.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.432
Drop your weapon.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.975
That's my son.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.060
You best listen.

36:31.522 --> 36:33.566
What? Come on.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.284
Look to the right.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.827
Now to the left.

36:44.827 --> 36:46.829
What can you see?

36:46.829 --> 36:49.332
The light. And your face, a little.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.292
- Okay, progress already.
- There we go.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.794
- Look at that.
- Now, you'll want
to rest your eyes for a few days.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.380
Eye drops will help
if you feel any discomfort.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.550
So he's fine? No hospitalization?

36:59.550 --> 37:01.802
- He can go home?
- He'll be fine in a day or two.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.429
Ugh.
Hey, your official cover story

37:03.429 --> 37:04.722
is that you sprayed yourself

37:04.722 --> 37:06.766
with computer screen cleaner
on a sales visit.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.434
Oh, come on, Gib.

37:08.434 --> 37:11.520
Can I get a more humiliating cover story?

37:11.520 --> 37:12.647
Sorry, buddy.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.149
We all have to sacrifice for this cause.

37:16.692 --> 37:17.902
Helen, you good to get him home?

37:17.902 --> 37:19.195
Yeah, I'm gonna give him a piggyback ride.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.154
Oh.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.073
I'll give you a hand.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.324
Okay. All right. One more person.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.871
Hey, Junior. Quinn here's been

37:28.871 --> 37:30.373
showing me the engineering department.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.791
And he has a lot of good ideas.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.709
Wow.
Also, you know,

37:33.709 --> 37:37.338
you guys have been doing
a lot of stuff kind of ass-backwards.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.298
Well, that might have to wait

37:39.298 --> 37:41.884
'cause, uh, operations
wants to talk to you

37:41.884 --> 37:43.511
about cleaning up the mess at Axe.

37:43.511 --> 37:47.640
Oh, sounds good. Uh, but, also, uh...

37:47.640 --> 37:51.477
word is you've got a girlfriend
in the building?

37:51.477 --> 37:54.230
Well... I mean...

37:54.230 --> 37:57.066
- I don't know about that, but...
- Well...

37:57.066 --> 38:00.278
all these years, and I've never yet
met a girlfriend of yours.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.071
Um, but that's on me.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.490
If you don't want me to meet her,
I understand.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.491
Come on.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.535
Her name's Eva.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.996
Yeah.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.081
Yeah, I mean,
we-we could go say hey to her.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.541
I guess that's not gonna hurt anybody.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.293
- Hmm.
- Just right over here.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.086
I'd like that, Gib.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.506
You just call me Gib?

38:20.506 --> 38:22.008
Well, yeah.

38:22.008 --> 38:24.343
- I guess I did.
- Oh.

38:27.346 --> 38:30.057
Oh. Hey.

38:30.057 --> 38:31.767
Hi.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.936
Glad I'm running into you.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.563
You said you liked the laser cutters?

38:35.563 --> 38:37.565
Yeah, yeah.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.025
I have the new version,

38:39.025 --> 38:40.276
if you'd want to see it.

38:40.276 --> 38:43.195
Yeah, you can show me that kind of stuff?

38:44.822 --> 38:46.032
Sorry.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.075
- Show me.
- Yes.

38:48.075 --> 38:51.620
- How was your day?
- Uh, more fire than I would have liked.

38:52.955 --> 38:55.374
Come on.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.501
There you go. All right, living room.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.211
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. Kitchen.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.380
Slowly.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.966
- No, I got it.
- Okay.

39:03.966 --> 39:05.051
Yeah.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.261
You see? I'm already getting better.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.721
Okay, good.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.389
Oh, no, no, no,
before you sit down, hold on.

39:10.389 --> 39:13.225
I just want to try one thing
while I have you.

39:13.225 --> 39:16.562
What? Oh, come on.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.856
Helen, please.
You're gonna do this to a blind man?

39:18.856 --> 39:21.192
I'm absolutely doing this to a blind man.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.735
Are we...

39:22.735 --> 39:23.944
Come on, just follow my lead.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.363
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.573
All right. Let me help you.
Hold on. Ready?

39:27.573 --> 39:30.910
- And... one.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.496
Hey.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.039
I'm getting it. Am I getting it?

39:35.039 --> 39:37.083
You are. I think blind Harry

39:37.083 --> 39:39.794
has more rhythm than regular Harry.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.004
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna have to get more of that gas.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.672
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
