00:07.007 --> 00:09.259
<i>What's your relationship</i>
<i>with Jerry Vincent?</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:11.011
He was murdered last night.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.222
<i>He left you his practice.</i>
<i>Including the Trevor Elliott trial.</i>

00:14.305 --> 00:16.516
<i>Tech guy</i>
<i>who killed his wife, her boyfriend.</i>

00:16.599 --> 00:17.475
<i>Allegedly.</i>

00:17.559 --> 00:20.729
I negotiated a deal
for my company to be acquired.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.106
But if this goes on any longer,

00:23.189 --> 00:26.484
or God forbid, we lose,
that deal goes away.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.070
And then I really
will have lost everything.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.574
-Remember Bruce Carlin?
-Jerry's investigator?

00:32.657 --> 00:33.867
<i>Yes. He's missing.</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:35.076
Then why did he run?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.203
Maybe he knows who killed Jerry.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.330
How's the trafficking case?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.750
I want to keep this
under wraps as long as I can

00:41.833 --> 00:45.211
<i>so that Soto doesn't see us coming,</i>
<i>and my witnesses don't get rattled.</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:46.296
Take a look at this.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.673
Got it from a camera
outside Jerry's building,

00:48.757 --> 00:50.008
around the time he was shot.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.718
So you got a suspect?

00:51.801 --> 00:55.513
The thing I had to figure out
was what pain the drugs were numbing.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.516
You can't recover until you know
what you're recovering from.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.810
Eli Wyms is the magic bullet.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.688
<i>He was arrested the same day</i>
<i>as the murders a couple miles away.</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:05.440
That's why Jerry wanted the case.

01:05.523 --> 01:08.151
It can't be a coincidence.
This guy knows something.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.237
What did Jerry Vincent know
that got him killed?

01:11.321 --> 01:12.947
<i>You're at risk, Counselor.</i>

01:13.031 --> 01:13.990
<i>You could be next.</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:18.036
<i>Haller?</i>

01:18.119 --> 01:20.371
The guy from the photo,
I think he was just here.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.040
Just get over here!

01:44.521 --> 01:45.355
Haller?

01:52.445 --> 01:53.321
Put the gun down.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.448
Oh, shit. Thank God.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.369
Did a quick sweep.
Whoever it was, he's gone.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.289
-You okay?
-You got the photo?

02:06.501 --> 02:07.919
This is the guy. Who is he?

02:08.002 --> 02:11.381
Our best guess is he's a hitter
brought in from out of town.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.424
Question is, what's he want from you?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.551
How should I know?

02:14.634 --> 02:16.678
Only one reason this guy would come back.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.221
He thinks you know something.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.723
-So, what is it?
-I told you everything I know.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.601
-What are you hiding?
-I'm not hiding anything, man.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.940
I'll come back later.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.609
-Shit.

02:32.443 --> 02:35.280
That's the last time
we'll ever get our trash picked up.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.867
Look, I've got the biggest trial
of my career coming up.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.785
Okay? And Jerry had a defense.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.122
Whatever it was, I think
it was in the briefcase this guy stole.

02:44.205 --> 02:47.292
So, if I knew anything
that could find him, I would tell you.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.880
Come on. I'd better walk you to your car.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.383
I don't want you
putting two in the mailman.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.552
I was about to go get something to eat.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.512
You wanna join?

03:01.139 --> 03:04.809
What? You got here in under five.
Least I can do is buy you a steak.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.437
You know Taylor's on Eighth?

03:07.520 --> 03:08.354
Yeah.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.440
They'll keep the kitchen open if I call.

03:46.684 --> 03:47.852
Sorry I'm late.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.063
Can't valet a city car.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.361
What?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.655
It was the lights, wasn't it?

04:01.699 --> 04:02.700
What lights?

04:04.494 --> 04:07.747
You were waiting for me outside.
That's how you got to me so fast.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.416
You saw me
turn out the lights in my office,

04:10.500 --> 04:12.585
that's when you knew
I was heading for the garage

04:12.669 --> 04:14.629
where your guy was waiting for me.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.965
-Ready?
-The photo gave it away.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.969
You said you'd bring it by the office,
show Jerry's assistant,

04:21.052 --> 04:23.179
-but you never came.
-Yeah. I got tied up.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.180
Bullshit.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.350
This photo was intended
for an audience of one, me.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.394
But the clincher was this.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.563
I asked my investigator
to look into your suspect.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.440
He's got a source in the LAPD.

04:35.191 --> 04:39.320
But as soon as he asked about the photo,
his source, he just dried up.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.489
Because they asked you about it, right?

04:41.572 --> 04:43.700
You used this to smoke out a leak.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.827
You set me up.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.580
For the record,

04:50.873 --> 04:53.334
smoking out the leak
was just a lucky bonus.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.878
Thought you were holding out on me.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.672
You thought I knew who killed Jerry?

04:57.755 --> 04:59.465
I had to consider the possibility.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.386
I was just trying
to scare you into talking, that's all.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.640
Look on the bright side.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.060
At least now I know
you're being honest with me.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.023
I call the Chief of Detectives,
I can end your career right now.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.900
Unless for once, you're honest with me.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.069
Now, what do you know
about Jerry's murder?

05:24.282 --> 05:25.283
Not much.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.618
But the week before he was shot,

05:27.702 --> 05:30.371
Jerry got a bunch of calls
from somebody in the FBI.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.123
I don't know who.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.375
The Feds don't share
their business with us.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.669
Jerry have any federal cases?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.087
No. Not at the moment.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.381
He could have been an informant.

05:40.465 --> 05:45.178
Or the target of an investigation.
Either one could've gotten him killed.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.346
Or, for all you know,

05:46.429 --> 05:48.848
somebody in the bureau
was in his fantasy league.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.185
I'm grasping
at straws here, Haller.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.520
Jerry's clients were a dead end,

05:54.604 --> 05:56.856
we lost his investigator,
this Bruce Carlin.

05:56.939 --> 05:57.857
You knew Jerry.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.026
Don't you want us
to find whoever killed him?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.819
I told you everything I know.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.822
It isn't what you know that can help me.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.825
It's what the killer thinks you know.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.078
Whoever killed Jerry,

06:10.161 --> 06:14.082
if we could make them think
you know something you're not supposed to,

06:14.165 --> 06:17.043
I can use that to draw them out.

06:17.126 --> 06:21.005
You're asking me to make
myself a target, like, for real this time?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.383
Maybe we'll find out
what was in that briefcase.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.843
You're really something, man.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.761
Wow.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.805
So, are you in?

06:42.068 --> 06:45.655
Could you answer
some questions about the Elliott trial?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.740
-Make it quick. I'm late.
-Certainly.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.452
Everybody was expecting you
to ask for a continuance, but you didn't.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.662
Could you tell us why?

06:52.745 --> 06:55.498
Mr. Elliott's been living
with these charges for months.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.708
He won't wait
a minute more to prove his innocence.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.377
But will you be ready?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.421
To prevent the miscarriage of justice?

07:01.504 --> 07:02.547
I'm always ready.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.215
This whole case is a tragedy.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.551
Whoever killed
Mr. Elliott's previous lawyer

07:06.634 --> 07:09.303
took his laptop
with all his confidential files on it.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.849
Fortunately, all those files
were backed up on an external hard drive,

07:12.932 --> 07:13.933
so I am up to speed

07:14.016 --> 07:16.936
and people are gonna see
this thing was a rush to judgment.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.605
-Excuse me.
-Are you concerned for your own safety?

07:24.735 --> 07:27.155
-When do I get my Oscar?
-<i>Guess we'll find out.</i>

07:27.238 --> 07:29.323
When someone takes a shot at me for real?

07:29.407 --> 07:30.616
<i>That's not gonna happen.</i>

07:30.700 --> 07:33.244
<i>We've got SIS on you. Surveillance unit.</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:37.373
<i>-You won't even know they're there.</i>
-Seems like the two of us could've come up

07:37.457 --> 07:39.417
with a better plan
than using me as a bait.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.171
I didn't catch much,
but I don't like the sound of "bait."

07:43.254 --> 07:45.131
I already thought
somebody was following us.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.216
It's okay. The cops are watching.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.677
Considering some
of the <i>locos</i> I've represented,

07:49.760 --> 07:51.971
today's probably the safest we'll ever be.

07:52.054 --> 07:54.932
You'll forgive me
if the LAPD having my back

07:55.016 --> 07:57.101
doesn't give me a lot of comfort.

08:05.818 --> 08:09.447
No. The only reason
he fired the gun in the first place

08:09.530 --> 08:11.991
was because
of the poor security in your building.

08:14.452 --> 08:18.080
Okay. You go talk to your boss
and we're just gonna draw up a lawsuit.

08:18.164 --> 08:18.998
Whoa.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.251
Nerve. That was the building manager.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.171
-They wanna throw us out.
-Another reason I work out of my car.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.464
What's on tap for today?

08:26.547 --> 08:30.218
First up, felony Internet fraud.
Sam Scales, he's one of Jerry's.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.887
I see a D in the file. As in delinquent?

08:32.970 --> 08:34.597
To the tune of $5,000.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.266
On the bright side,
if he ever does pay, it's fresh cash.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.185
Wonderful. What's next?

08:39.268 --> 08:41.562
You're on the list at County
to meet with Eli Wyms.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.398
You still think
that Wyms is Jerry's magic bullet?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.317
-Has to be.
-I don't see how.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.571
Wyms went Rambo hours before the murders,
he couldn't have been the killer.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.031
He was in custody by then.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.908
I just know he's connected somehow.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.868
It's the only thing that makes any sense.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.870
-Oh.

08:57.954 --> 08:58.913
Hello.

08:58.996 --> 08:59.997
Mmm-hmm.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.751
Fine, I'll run it by my boss.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.671
When do we have to move?

09:06.754 --> 09:09.382
We don't. And the landlord
will pay for the repairs.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.301
You see that? You just shifted liability.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.929
You'd make a helluva lawyer, Lorna.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.601
<i>Objection, Your Honor.</i>

09:20.685 --> 09:22.937
There is no basis
whatsoever to the allegation

09:23.020 --> 09:24.605
my client embezzled from a charity.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.856
Mr. Haller is right.

09:25.940 --> 09:29.485
The People do not contend
that Mr. Scales embezzled from a charity

09:29.569 --> 09:33.030
because that would imply
that such a charity actually existed.

09:33.114 --> 09:37.243
Instead, Mr. Scales
solicited donations for cancer research,

09:37.326 --> 09:41.789
which he then spent on Lakers tickets,
rare wine…

09:41.872 --> 09:45.209
Are you committing more crimes
while I'm representing you in court?

09:45.293 --> 09:48.963
…a commercial-grade
espresso machine, a vintage Rolex watch--

09:49.046 --> 09:51.549
Your Honor,
may I have a brief word with my client?

09:58.347 --> 10:02.310
I don't need to be here, Sam.
God knows I don't want to be here.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.187
I inherited Jerry's assets,
not his liabilities.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.689
You are a liability.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.482
I know. I'm behind on my payments.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.817
-But I'm broke.
-Yeah?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.028
What about the fucking
espresso machine, huh?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.279
And, what, the Rolex?

10:13.362 --> 10:15.239
I sold them to make bail.

10:15.323 --> 10:19.910
Hey, I got mad computer skills, though.
Maybe we could work something out.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.580
No. "Something"
has to be a tangible asset,

10:22.663 --> 10:24.707
like a car, a boat.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.877
Not really a big boater.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.129
Well, think of something.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.049
You have until Friday,
or I withdraw as your counsel.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.551
That means a delay,
and delay is not your friend.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.472
You might get on the Feds' radar.
Then you will go down for wire fraud.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.350
Do you know what that means?
It means no probation.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.894
You do all the time. Do you understand?

10:44.977 --> 10:46.270
Yeah.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.938
Atta boy. Let's go back in.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.357
We oppose any bail.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.401
These are serious charges,
the defendant is a flight risk.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.028
Mr. Soto is not some mob boss.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.031
He's a respected businessman
with deep ties to the community.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.450
His elder care facilities
receive five-star ratings.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.285
Built on the backs of slave labor.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.953
That is an outrageous accusation!

11:03.037 --> 11:05.456
He doesn't pay employees
and they can't leave.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.167
-What would you call it?
-Let's take it down a notch.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.430
The court finds
Mr. Soto is a flight risk.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.183
But I'm not persuaded
he's a danger to the community.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.353
As a result,
bail will be set at $2 million.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.273
Mr. Soto will surrender his passport
and submit to an ankle monitor.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.650
Everybody clear?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.735
<i>The judge split the baby.</i>

11:34.819 --> 11:37.071
Soto got bail,
but he's not going anywhere.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.739
That's some good news at least.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.865
What's the bad news?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.201
We raided Soto's nursing homes last night,

11:42.284 --> 11:44.662
and the other employees
aren't willing to cooperate.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.206
That explains the texts
I'm getting from my witness.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.749
He's having second thoughts.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.167
We had to do something.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.169
These people are terrified.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.463
How about sending in
one female detective next time,

11:54.547 --> 11:55.881
not an entire SWAT team?

11:57.007 --> 12:00.136
-Where you heading now?
-To talk my witness off the ledge.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.114
It's okay.
Nobody's shooting at us in broad daylight.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.283
I'm glad you're relaxed.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.326
Well, I like a long car ride.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.455
It's where I get my best work done.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.290
No distractions, forward motion.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.417
Learned that from my dad.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.429
<i>It's Trevor. Leave a message.</i>

12:44.430 --> 12:45.931
<i>You know who this is.</i>

12:46.015 --> 12:47.975
Jury selection starts Wednesday.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.894
The 12 citizens who are gonna decide

12:49.977 --> 12:52.438
whether you spend
the rest of your life in prison or not.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.106
No time to play games. Call me.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.277
-Everything okay?
-I've had difficult clients before.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.489
But this Trevor guy
is a whole new thing.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.201
Bet you never had
a client as rich as him.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.328
Some of the singers I toured with?

13:08.662 --> 13:10.915
Life looks different
through all those zeroes.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.871
Eli. Mickey Haller, your attorney.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.541
You remember me?

13:54.917 --> 13:57.419
-From court.
-That's right. From court.

13:58.546 --> 14:03.050
Listen, uh, I wanna go over your case
and ask you a few questions, all right?

14:03.133 --> 14:06.637
It's about something else
that happened the night you were arrested.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.389
I got nothing to say to you.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.393
Eli, I'm here to help you.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.394
Yeah.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.687
That's what Jerry said.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.398
And then he left me here.

14:18.732 --> 14:19.608
I'm not Jerry.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.279
Eli, you're in serious trouble.
Attempted murder of a peace officer.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.446
That's 20 to life.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.364
No!

14:27.992 --> 14:29.159
It's okay.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.414
I can hit a target from 800 yards.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.791
You don't think
I would've hit those cops if I wanted?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.544
Then talk to me, man. Tell me your story.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.381
Wanna hear my story?

14:43.674 --> 14:45.301
Then get me out of here first.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.468
Until then, fuck you.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.179
<i>You kidding?</i>

14:49.263 --> 14:52.391
The '96 Bulls would destroy
today's Lakers. They wouldn't win a game.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.310
Michael would stop LeBron?

14:54.393 --> 14:56.812
No, Dennis Rodman would stop LeBron.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.272
-Michael would--
-I'm sorry.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.693
He'd score 70
'cause nobody can hand check him today.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.613
Wait. Which team
did you put in the time machine, again?

15:05.696 --> 15:06.572
Chips.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.685
You do not look like someone
who had all his questions answered.

15:45.069 --> 15:45.945
This is Haller.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.113
We both know
Jerry didn't have his files backed up.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.032
<i>Barely knew how to turn on a laptop.</i>

15:50.115 --> 15:51.825
-Who's this?
-Bruce Carlin.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.954
Okay, you got me.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.040
Don't want the DA to think
I'm going into trial with nothing.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.919
<i>I know what you're doing.</i>
<i>This has Griggs' fingerprints all over it.</i>

16:02.544 --> 16:04.797
-I didn't kill Jerry.
-<i>Why are you on the run?</i>

16:04.880 --> 16:07.591
Why are you calling me
to bust my balls about lying?

16:07.675 --> 16:09.551
Whatever we say is privileged, right?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.929
<i>If you wanna hire me</i>
<i>to cut a deal, sure.</i>

16:12.012 --> 16:14.139
But first I need something from you.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.683
Tell me about Eli Wyms.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.809
Who's that?

16:16.892 --> 16:20.521
<i>Jerry's client.</i>
<i>Drunk ex-marine, shot at a bunch of cops?</i>

16:20.604 --> 16:22.940
Tell me how
he's connected to the Elliott case.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.733
<i>I never heard of the guy.</i>

16:24.817 --> 16:27.027
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:29.279
I can give you
the number of another lawyer.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.782
I called you.
You're up to your eyeballs in this.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.243
<i>All I care about right now</i>
<i>is Trevor Elliott.</i>

16:34.326 --> 16:36.704
You have information on Jerry,
call Griggs.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.455
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.627
You saying they're connected? How?
Jerry's murder with the Elliott case?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.422
Not on the phone.
You know where Royce Canyon is?

16:46.505 --> 16:47.589
Griffith Park?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.842
<i>Seven o'clock tonight.</i>
<i>By the picnic tables.</i>

16:49.925 --> 16:51.176
<i>Come alone. No cops.</i>

16:52.344 --> 16:54.680
<i>If I know Griggs,</i>
<i>he's got SIS all over you.</i>

16:54.763 --> 16:56.015
How do I lose them?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.809
That's your problem.
But if you're followed, I'll know.

17:03.230 --> 17:07.359
Hey. Oh. Excellent choice.
That's my favorite. You need napkins.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.612
Here you go.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.739
Okay, sweetheart.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.283
Daddy is gonna
talk to his friend for a minute.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.242
She's cute.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.997
I went to work this morning
and they were staring.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.583
I think they know it was me.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.334
You came to us, David.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.794
You said you couldn't sleep

17:25.878 --> 17:28.047
knowing what Soto
was doing to these people.

17:28.130 --> 17:32.259
I know. But I'm a parent.
I didn't think about that.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.094
Okay. So, we have a program.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.805
We can relocate
you and your family before the trial.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.557
Pay your rent, everything.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.393
If I leave,
Soto will know for sure it was me.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.646
Everyone I know lives here.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.607
My parents, my sister.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.902
We all live in the same neighborhood,
we go to the same church.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.361
Who's gonna protect them?

17:51.445 --> 17:53.072
Do what's right for your family.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.323
Just so you understand,

17:54.406 --> 17:57.034
if you don't testify,
we have to dismiss the charges.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.994
Then nobody is stopping Soto.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.630
You sure meeting up
with this ex-cop is a good idea?

18:09.713 --> 18:13.008
No. But if he knows something
about Elliott, I want to hear it.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.886
The guy who won't even take your call?

18:15.969 --> 18:17.888
Got a lot riding on this trial, Izzy.

18:18.514 --> 18:23.143
If I can win it,
maybe I can get back what I lost.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.146
You think there's a chance
Elliott might be innocent?

18:26.230 --> 18:27.773
He says he is.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.234
In my business,
that would be what we call a unicorn.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.568
You ever had one before?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.237
Yeah.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.365
<i>A guy named Jesús Menendez.</i>

18:38.075 --> 18:39.701
He's doing 15 years for murder.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.329
-Damn.
-Yeah.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.123
A witness disappeared on me.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.209
Without her, he was looking at life.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.753
So I had to plead him out.
Best thing I could do.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.340
Then my accident happened
and I just kind of buried it.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.261
Until that cop got into it with me
at the bar the other night.

18:59.096 --> 19:02.057
The night you had
a staring contest with a shot and a beer?

19:03.642 --> 19:06.395
Boy, you don't miss anything,
do you, Freud?

19:08.939 --> 19:12.151
Talking about this stuff. Your triggers…

19:13.485 --> 19:16.196
It's a good first step.
But it works better in a group.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.824
There's a meeting tonight.
I'll save you a chair.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.076
Thank you. I'm allergic to circle sitting.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.452
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.580
So that's it?

19:24.663 --> 19:27.499
You're just gonna
white knuckle it the rest of your life?

19:29.251 --> 19:30.460
Oh.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.795
I get it.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.047
You hired
another addict to drive you around

19:34.131 --> 19:35.507
and help keep you straight.

19:36.133 --> 19:36.967
Mmm.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.595
That's not like going to meetings at all.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.983
-Griggs.
-<i>You calling it a day?</i>

19:53.066 --> 19:55.694
Not even close.
There's no telling when I'll be done.

19:55.777 --> 19:58.071
So, everything cool so far?

19:58.155 --> 20:00.616
<i>All quiet.</i>
<i>Just go about your business.</i>

20:00.699 --> 20:02.201
<i>-We'll be watching.</i>
-All right.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.119
You ready?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.537
Let's go.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.877
Ah, shit.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.712
You good?

20:55.796 --> 20:57.839
Yeah. After I see a chiropractor.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.310
What?

21:10.394 --> 21:12.229
I had to borrow Lorna's car.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.647
Just get in.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.025
Damn.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.736
Don't forget your seat belt.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.754
-Yes?
-<i>I told you to come alone.</i>

21:37.838 --> 21:40.007
I am alone. I'm a sitting duck out here.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.925
<i>They were here. They're on to you.</i>

21:42.009 --> 21:43.760
-Who's they?
-<i>You fucked up.</i>

21:43.844 --> 21:45.345
Carlin, who's they?

21:45.429 --> 21:47.931
What does Jerry's murder
have to do with Elliott?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.516
-Carlin?

21:51.643 --> 21:52.894
Shit.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.652
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-We lost Carlin. Where are you?

22:02.779 --> 22:04.990
It wasn't me, Mick. I was a mile away.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.784
Yeah, well, somebody spooked him.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.287
Carlin's an ex-cop, right?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.874
He would have got there
at least an hour early.

22:13.957 --> 22:17.961
So, whoever scared him off
wasn't following you. They were waiting.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.965
Griggs told me
the FBI was onto Jerry about something.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.718
You think they bugged your phone?

22:24.801 --> 22:27.721
I don't see how. They wouldn't
have probable cause for a warrant.

22:31.350 --> 22:35.062
If you were gonna bug
the Lincoln Lawyer, how would you do it?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.472
-No, leave it.
-What?

23:10.555 --> 23:11.598
If we take it out,

23:11.681 --> 23:14.267
whoever planted it
will know we're on to them.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.685
This way, we have the upper hand.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.438
How you gonna talk
about your cases in a bugged car?

23:18.522 --> 23:20.690
Ah, I'll work around it.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.820
You know,
I left a motorcycle club to work for you,

23:24.903 --> 23:27.948
and somehow my life's gotten even crazier.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.996
Why did I talk
the landlord into letting us stay?

23:35.080 --> 23:38.125
-Now this whole office--
-Jesus, Lorna. We're fine.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.167
Bugs.

23:42.045 --> 23:44.297
You never did tell me
where you got that gun.

23:44.381 --> 23:48.677
No, I didn't.
Cisco's trying to keep us all safe.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.346
In spite of my best efforts.
Don't blame him.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.766
Another thing.
I need you to get a file for me.

23:54.850 --> 23:55.767
Which one?

23:56.810 --> 23:57.811
Jesús Menendez.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.565
I'm pretty sure that one's in storage.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.442
Yeah, well, dig it out, Lorna.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.111
-Please. Thank you.
-We're clear. No bugs.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.195
Good.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.574
Still not gonna feel comfortable
until I know who bugged your car.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.451
Whoever did tried to ambush Carlin,

24:12.534 --> 24:14.744
Carlin knows who they are.
We gotta find him.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.830
That's easier said than done.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.416
I mean, he must have
a stolen identity or something

24:19.499 --> 24:22.961
because my LAPD guy
said he's totally off the grid.

24:23.044 --> 24:26.047
Get him back on.
I'm not going into this trial in the dark.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.049
Okay? Find Carlin.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.526
Fuck.

25:02.209 --> 25:06.046
All right, man-to-man defense.
You take the wife, I take the husband.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.297
Separate rooms. Got it?

25:22.979 --> 25:24.898
Riverside Police. Open up.

25:28.985 --> 25:29.986
Riverside Police.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.123
-Yeah. Tomorrow?

25:42.832 --> 25:44.042
So I'll call tomorrow?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.461
Come on, Hayley!

25:46.545 --> 25:49.047
Yeah! Yes! Good job.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.090
Hayley!

25:51.967 --> 25:55.220
Okay, go ahead. Say it.
"Who's the workaholic now?"

25:55.303 --> 25:56.763
No, I just wanted to tell you

25:56.846 --> 25:59.057
what a great job
you're doing as a snack mom.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.850
-Oh.
-Lots of healthy choices.

26:00.934 --> 26:01.935
Thank you.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.064
He's not the one
I got into it with, is he?

26:06.147 --> 26:07.774
-Who?
-The ref.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.025
Come on.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.569
Thought he was eyeballing me.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.571
He probably recognizes you from TV.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.490
-I saw you, Mr. Bigshot.
-Oh, yeah? How did I look?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.284
Better than on your bus stop ad.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.207
Be right back, okay?

26:24.291 --> 26:25.542
What?

26:25.625 --> 26:26.835
Oh, duty calls?

26:26.918 --> 26:29.879
Phone call's one thing.
This is a whole other level.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.550
Come on, Hayley.

26:33.633 --> 26:34.551
Yes.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.266
I just saw Eli Wyms.
He's doing much better off his meds.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.309
Glad to hear it.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.853
He wants this all behind him.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.646
So do I and so do you, Coach.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.900
Can't you bug me
for more playing time like other dads?

26:52.652 --> 26:55.196
Look, I don't have much wiggle room here.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.740
He shot at cops.

26:56.823 --> 26:57.657
Did he?

26:57.741 --> 27:00.994
You said it yourself, the guy's
a trained sniper, twice decorated.

27:01.077 --> 27:03.413
If he was shooting
at the cops, they'd be dead.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.582
-The lights startled him.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.043
Instinct kicked in.
He fired some warning shots.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.378
Ninety rounds of warning shots?

27:12.672 --> 27:16.051
Every trial has its story.
Wanna hear the story I'm gonna tell?

27:16.134 --> 27:18.386
No. But you're gonna tell it anyway.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.348
A man who served
his country with bravery and honor.

27:21.431 --> 27:24.100
A hero who saved the lives
of seven other soldiers

27:24.184 --> 27:26.645
when their convoy
was ambushed outside of Ramadi.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.440
I'll get every single one
of those soldiers to testify if I have to.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.530
Thank you for your service.

27:38.281 --> 27:40.784
This is not
just about Eli Wyms, Joanne.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.411
It's about
our entire military industrial complex.

27:43.495 --> 27:47.082
Our forever wars,
the shameful neglect of our veterans.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.042
And I'm gonna put it all on trial or…

27:49.834 --> 27:51.002
Let's just make a deal.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.881
Were you really in the Army?

27:54.964 --> 27:57.133
Yeah.
Where do you think I learnt computers?

27:57.217 --> 27:59.427
Let me guess. Dishonorable discharge.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.637
Well, yeah.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.226
Pow.

28:06.851 --> 28:07.686
What's that?

28:07.769 --> 28:09.187
I got to thinking.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.524
If Carlin stole someone's ID,
maybe he got it from working here.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.818
I've been going through
all the delinquent clients.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.111
"Wayne Banks."

28:16.194 --> 28:17.779
It's mostly drug stuff.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.614
Guy owed Jerry for some legal work.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.784
So, a couple years ago,
Jerry sent Carlin over to collect,

28:22.867 --> 28:24.119
according to his notes,

28:24.202 --> 28:27.205
when Carlin got there,
Banks was dead from an overdose.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.582
I'm sure Jerry
had other clients croak on him.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.127
Yeah, but they all had
death certificates.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.837
All except this guy.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.549
According to LA County,
Wayne Banks is still very much alive.

28:37.632 --> 28:42.387
Carlin's cop buddies
took his body in as a John Doe.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.432
No family, no estate.
It's perfect.

28:46.182 --> 28:49.936
And the last time Banks paid Jerry,
it was from this checking account.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.647
If you were Carlin, what would you do?

28:53.231 --> 28:56.401
I would keep the account
and I would change the address.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.318
Hmm.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.363
You are brilliant.

29:00.447 --> 29:01.281
I know.

29:02.615 --> 29:05.118
Easy, tiger. We're at the office.

29:08.079 --> 29:12.000
Uh, my name is Banks. B-A-N-K-S.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.547
The last four of my social, yes.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.299
Eight-seven-two-five.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.513
Well, uh, I'm worried
that somebody cloned my debit card,

29:25.597 --> 29:29.517
and I'm hoping that you can tell me
the last place that I used it.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.270
Yep. Let me get a pen.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.775
El Adobe Market at Riverside.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.206
I told you, got nothing to say.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.416
No, what you said is,
"Get me out of here."

30:01.299 --> 30:03.760
I got the prosecutor to drop the charges

30:03.843 --> 30:06.596
to one count
of reckless discharge of a firearm.

30:06.679 --> 30:07.972
What does that mean?

30:08.056 --> 30:09.432
It's three years.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.559
Good behavior, you'll be out in one.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.519
I knew it.

30:13.728 --> 30:14.646
What?

30:15.563 --> 30:17.482
You lawyers are all the fucking same.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.236
Are you crazy, Eli?

30:22.070 --> 30:23.530
You're actually crazy?

30:23.613 --> 30:26.032
'Cause only someone
with a serious mental illness

30:26.115 --> 30:30.620
would think they can open fire on cops,
then walk out the door a free man.

30:30.703 --> 30:34.165
This is the best deal you're gonna get.
You don't want it? Fine.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.168
Stay here
because this is where you belong.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.089
Okay.

30:44.050 --> 30:44.968
I'll do the year.

30:46.469 --> 30:47.303
Good.

30:48.137 --> 30:50.431
That's the smart thing to do, Eli.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.272
I need something
from you, all right? The truth.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.483
Whatever you tell me is privileged.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.902
Whatever you got involved in,
I can help you.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.362
What are you talking about?

31:09.534 --> 31:11.202
You think I killed these people?

31:11.286 --> 31:13.955
No, but if you got involved in any way…

31:14.581 --> 31:17.041
I never heard
of these people before in my life.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.751
Are you sure, Eli?

31:18.835 --> 31:20.420
Did Jerry ask you about him?

31:20.503 --> 31:21.462
Come on, think.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.505
I told you, man.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.591
Jerry never asked me shit.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.009
He just dumped me in here.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.219
You must have… All right, come on, look.

31:29.429 --> 31:33.391
This is where you were arrested.
Topanga State Park, 2:35 a.m.

31:33.474 --> 31:36.728
Nine hours later, somebody killed
these two people at this house.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.938
-Just a few miles away.
-So?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.982
So it can't be a coincidence, Eli.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.776
You drove
past that house that night, maybe?

31:43.860 --> 31:46.529
You must have seen something,
know something or else--

31:46.613 --> 31:47.530
Or else what?

31:49.824 --> 31:52.160
Jerry would have
never taken my sorry-ass case?

31:55.663 --> 31:57.540
Yeah. Basically.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.551
So, you want to hear my story?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.517
My wife threw me out of the house.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.775
It was mostly my fault.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.527
But I bought a case of beer

32:26.611 --> 32:30.198
and I went up
into the hills to blow off some steam.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.534
Wound up shooting
a bunch of cans for the hell of it.

32:34.869 --> 32:35.995
And it felt good.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.791
Squeezing the trigger, you know.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.834
Seeing the cans fly.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.925
Next thing I know, there's lights on me.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.596
That's all I remember.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.193
Trevor. Trevor, you there?

33:07.276 --> 33:09.445
<i>I'm here.</i>
<i>Sorry I've been so hard to reach.</i>

33:09.529 --> 33:11.823
I've been slammed
by the release of our new game.

33:11.906 --> 33:15.868
-<i>Got my message?</i>
-I did. Jury selection on Wednesday.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.912
No, your trial starts Wednesday.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.581
<i>Once we pick a jury,</i>
<i>there's no turning back,</i>

33:20.665 --> 33:21.666
no more delays,

33:21.749 --> 33:24.377
unless you change your mind
about a continuance.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.087
<i>You know my answer to that.</i>

33:26.170 --> 33:28.673
Lara and I talked a lot
about our plans for the company.

33:28.756 --> 33:32.343
It was just as important
to her as it is to me, maybe more so.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.470
You know what
I can't figure out about you?

33:34.554 --> 33:36.597
You're not scared. Why?

33:36.681 --> 33:40.309
Because I'm innocent
and I have faith in my lawyer.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.063
Does the name Eli Wyms
mean anything to you?

33:44.147 --> 33:44.981
No. Should it?

33:45.064 --> 33:46.941
<i>I'd be surprised if it did.</i>

33:47.025 --> 33:48.818
It would make too much sense.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.279
Just clear your calendar.
We have work to do.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.963
Yeah, I got him.
What do you want me to do?

34:09.922 --> 34:11.632
Just stay on him. I'm on my way.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.800
All right.

34:51.214 --> 34:54.592
I still can't believe that save.
You pitched a shutout today.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.887
Yeah. CoJo calls it
"keeping a clean sheet."

34:57.970 --> 35:00.389
CoJo's been watching
too much Premier League.

35:00.473 --> 35:04.060
Yeah. I'm glad you and Dad
were both there to see us win for once.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.603
Yeah, me too.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.273
I saw you guys laughing on the sideline.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.109
Well, we were into the game.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.698
Do you think Dad's okay?

35:17.782 --> 35:18.950
Why wouldn't he be?

35:20.201 --> 35:23.079
I don't know.
I'm just kind of worried about him

35:23.162 --> 35:24.831
taking on all these cases.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.082
Especially the big one.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.253
I worry about him too, honey.

35:30.837 --> 35:34.132
But if I know anything about your dad,
he's really good at what he does.

35:34.215 --> 35:37.260
If anyone can juggle
all those balls at once, it's him.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.098
It's Saturday. I'm with my daughter.

35:42.181 --> 35:45.143
<i>You gotta get here right away.</i>
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

35:45.226 --> 35:46.060
What's going on?

35:46.144 --> 35:47.186
<i>It's your witness.</i>

35:53.067 --> 35:54.193
Stay back.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.740
Just stay here.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.242
Why? Mom, what's happening?

36:01.325 --> 36:02.952
Hayley, just, please.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.370
-Hey.
-What happened?

36:04.453 --> 36:06.956
Look, the unis
are calling it a carjacking, but…

36:07.039 --> 36:08.040
How is he?

36:08.124 --> 36:09.709
You should try to get a statement.

36:09.792 --> 36:13.462
-Hang on.
-David, who did this to you?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.675
-Ma'am, step aside.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.802
-Mom?
-We gotta move him now.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.053
Hayley.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.056
-Honey.
-I was worried.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.559
Come on.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.230
I said, man-to-man, not zone. One job.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.442
-She came out of nowhere.
-'Cause you weren't paying attention.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.737
Sorry. I told her
to stay in the other room.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.573
-Look at this guy. Hang on.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.385
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-Hey, Mick.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.887
<i>We got a problem.</i>

37:02.970 --> 37:06.766
Sit your ass down and watch.
Maybe you can learn something.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.656
Yeah, well, they pulled him over.

37:22.448 --> 37:24.450
License and registration, please.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.245
-I wasn't speeding.
-You ran a stop sign, sir.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.705
No. I stopped. I always stop.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.543
How about a warning?
I was on the job. LAPD.

37:36.587 --> 37:37.713
And your registration?

37:43.135 --> 37:44.762
Put your hands on the wheel now!

37:44.845 --> 37:45.680
Shit.

37:46.555 --> 37:48.599
Man, things are going south here.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.352
-Let me explain.
-Shut up. Out of the car, hands up.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.562
-I'm an ex-cop.
-Get out of the car!

37:53.646 --> 37:54.939
Get out of the car now!

37:55.022 --> 37:57.942
-Carlin's got two guns on him.
-Stay there. I'll call you back.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.782
Haller, are you okay?

38:04.865 --> 38:06.701
-Bruce Carlin's in trouble.
-<i>What?</i>

38:06.784 --> 38:10.371
He saw the interview and called me.
Now cops in Riverside have guns on him.

38:10.454 --> 38:13.165
-What the fuck?
-Rip me a new one later. I need your help.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.210
Get out of the car!

38:16.294 --> 38:18.421
Shut up!
Get out of the car with your hands up.

38:18.504 --> 38:21.924
<i>Unit 217, I have</i>
<i>a Detective Griggs from LAPD on the line.</i>

38:22.008 --> 38:24.260
<i>Says it's urgent regarding your 10-32.</i>

38:24.343 --> 38:25.303
Put him through.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.595
<i>This is Griggs.</i>

38:26.679 --> 38:29.056
An SIS unit
is on the way to you right now.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.726
The man you pulled over,
his name is not Wayne Banks.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.352
<i>It's Bruce Carlin.</i>

38:33.436 --> 38:35.896
<i>Call him that. Bruce Carlin.</i>

38:35.980 --> 38:37.815
<i>We need this guy alive, understand?</i>

38:37.898 --> 38:39.525
He's a POI in a homicide.

38:39.608 --> 38:42.653
Bruce Carlin. We know who you are.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.322
Now get out of the car.

38:47.366 --> 38:50.494
Okay.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.914
Okay, hey, he's exiting the car.
I think they're gonna arrest him.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.125
Okay. Just let me explain.

38:56.208 --> 39:00.129
Shut the fuck up and get on the ground!
On the ground! Hey, watch it!

39:00.212 --> 39:01.380
Shit.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.674
-Unit 217, requesting…
-Oh, my God.

39:04.216 --> 39:05.676
<i>Cisco, do they have him?</i>

39:05.760 --> 39:06.886
Oh, my God.

39:07.595 --> 39:11.223
He came out of nowhere.
I didn't even see him. Oh, my God.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.868
-Haller.
-How the hell did you get in here?

39:30.951 --> 39:32.995
That's a risky move given my history.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.538
We had an agreement.

39:36.874 --> 39:40.711
Bruce Carlin was the only one
who took our bait. Now, he's dead.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.881
I'm just looking
for some answers. Same as you.

39:45.633 --> 39:50.137
Look, I don't know
what the Feds were talking to Jerry about.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.765
A couple of days ago, my assistant told me

39:52.848 --> 39:54.975
there's over 100 grand
missing from his accounts.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.435
I don't know if they're related.

39:56.519 --> 39:59.563
I don't know where it went.
I don't know anything, all right?

40:03.109 --> 40:04.443
Yeah, what is it, honey?

40:15.454 --> 40:17.081
Maggie? It's me.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.509
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.887
Hayley called. Told me what happened.

40:34.181 --> 40:38.477
She saw it. I told her to wait in the car.
She didn't listen.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.479
Yeah, I know. She's okay.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.189
It's you she's worried about.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.276
It's my fault.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.027
Hey, don't do that to yourself.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.156
He was my witness
and he didn't want to do it,

40:50.239 --> 40:51.490
and I pressured him.

40:54.869 --> 41:00.124
-He had a little girl, Mickey.
-My God. Come here. It's okay.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.294
Don't do that to yourself, honey.

41:03.377 --> 41:06.881
-But I should have--
-No. No, you did everything you could.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.968
Okay? I mean, if there's
one I know about you, it's that.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.605
I should, um…

41:22.688 --> 41:24.565
Yeah.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.358
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

41:29.028 --> 41:30.571
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.490
Okay.

42:00.434 --> 42:01.727
Okay.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.854
Welcome to the nine o'clock meeting.

42:04.647 --> 42:08.651
Is there anybody new that would
like to start this evening? Hmm?

42:09.693 --> 42:10.569
Anybody at all?

42:22.039 --> 42:25.626
-My name is Michael and I'm an addict.
-Hi, Michael.
