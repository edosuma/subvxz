WEBVTT

00:11.112 --> 00:12.213
Check!

00:13.714 --> 00:14.715
Check.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.217
Good morning, baby.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.019
It's not controversial.
It's standard.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.355
Well... semi-standard.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.624
-But okay.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.494
Standard that elliptical curve
is inherently better than RSA.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.196
You realize you're
saying this as someone

02:42.230 --> 02:46.033
who doesn't work in encryption
to someone who does.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.969
So you're saying they're equal?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.972
Both are weak to attack
from quantum computers,

02:52.005 --> 02:54.041
so by sharing
the same weak point,

02:54.074 --> 02:56.210
are equally weak.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.680
RSA is still
more brute-forcible.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.356
Dude. Please.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.824
Hey, man.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.561
Thanks.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.229
Hey, Lily.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.564
How you doing, Pete?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.599
Oh, you know, I'm good.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.236
You guys have a great day.
You know?

03:22.270 --> 03:24.905
Be all you can be.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.376
-Hey.
-We're gonna nail it today.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.411
You bet.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.686
So, this is it.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.054
-Let me know, okay?
-Of course.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.556
Good luck.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.893
Hey.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.605
Bye.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.924
Just tell me it's still alive.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.759
Yeah, it's still alive.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.127
Looks happy.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.514
Guys.
Sorry, we're late.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.915
I was putting out fires.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.218
You see that thing this morning?

06:25.252 --> 06:27.921
-Uh, no.
-Seems the world

06:27.955 --> 06:31.625
is pissed because our qubits
work and theirs don't.

06:31.659 --> 06:35.095
So one of our competitors
planted a New York Times story

06:35.128 --> 06:37.898
suggesting we get
government oversight,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.033
which was nice.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.469
Anyway, we're here.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.904
We have 15 minutes.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.239
And you have some cool stuff
to show us.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.642
We hope.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.044
Well, we all hope.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.380
Hit us.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
Okay.
Jen?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.489
So...

07:01.522 --> 07:03.791
this is iteration 89

07:03.824 --> 07:05.793
of the nematode simulation.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.161
302 neurons mapped.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.429
Nurture data tracked

07:09.463 --> 07:12.566
from moment
of first cell division.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.636
Beautiful.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.105
Okay. Synchronize.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.673
Synchronizing.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.976
In three,

07:23.010 --> 07:24.978
two,

07:25.012 --> 07:26.580
one,

07:26.614 --> 07:28.616
go.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.952
Overlay, please.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.888
Here comes overlay.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.534
Whoa.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.706
That's impressive.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.441
Thank you.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.644
And at this moment there's
no sensor-based connection

07:56.677 --> 07:58.646
between the nematode
and the simulation?

07:58.679 --> 08:01.849
Nothing at all from this point
of synchronization.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.385
This is movement initiated
by the mapped neurons

08:05.418 --> 08:07.454
and the nurture data.
That's all.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.022
In which case
you can demonstrate that

08:09.056 --> 08:10.490
with a future projection?

08:10.524 --> 08:12.325
Absolutely.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.061
Ten seconds?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.129
Yes.
Jen?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.131
-Predicted movement loop,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.267
ten seconds into the future.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.572
So that's five,

08:24.605 --> 08:26.473
four,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.408
three,

08:28.441 --> 08:30.343
two,

08:30.377 --> 08:32.980
one.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.887
So, right in front of my eyes,

08:39.920 --> 08:42.656
you just predicted
the exact behavior

08:42.690 --> 08:45.058
of a living organism.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.060
Ten seconds into the future.

08:48.395 --> 08:52.165
The simplest organism
we could find.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.501
But... yes.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.503
We did.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.538
I love it.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.448
Okay, and...

09:08.481 --> 09:10.450
So, about 30 seconds

09:10.483 --> 09:12.419
from the moment we synchronize,

09:12.452 --> 09:15.288
we start to lose correlation.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.559
30 seconds.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.595
Thereabouts.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.768
Why do you think that is?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.537
Sheer complexity.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.641
The numbers we're crunching
go insane.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.710
As in... truly insane.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.612
Or?

09:39.647 --> 09:42.449
It's a quantum-type problem.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.052
Somewhere in the multiverse,

09:45.085 --> 09:48.088
there is a world
where the two stay in sync.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.824
But it's not this one.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.295
Not a fan
of the multiverse theory.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.998
I'd go with the former.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.043
Guys, can you give us a moment?

10:28.862 --> 10:31.699
Sergei, you've done
fantastic work.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.102
Exceptional work.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.138
But I think your time
in the AI division

10:38.171 --> 10:40.507
has run its course.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.146
I want you to join Devs.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.181
Devs?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.486
Yeah.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.801
Thank you.

11:07.835 --> 11:11.304
And you literally start
tomorrow-- just straight in?

11:11.338 --> 11:12.806
Apparently.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.475
I mean, there's
a security process.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.812
But as long as I pass,
by the end of the day,

11:18.846 --> 11:20.413
I'll be in there.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.949
Doing it.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.752
You're not gonna be able
to tell me anything

11:24.785 --> 11:26.519
about what that is.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.722
Well, I might be able to.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.223
No.
I'm saying

11:30.257 --> 11:32.159
let's keep it simple.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.829
You tell me nothing,
and I never ask.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.666
Otherwise it could be
a thing between us, you know?

11:39.699 --> 11:43.203
I don't want it
to be a thing between us.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.810
I'm not going to be able
to sleep.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.217
So let's not sleep.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.758
Born: Moscow.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.228
Moved to the U.S., age 22.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.798
MIT.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.833
Then a failed start-up.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.635
Then another.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.637
And then here.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.639
For three years.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.174
Yes.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.644
You're dating someone
at the company.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.314
Yes, that's right.
Lily Chan.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.549
She works in encryption.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.219
-And is Chinese.
-Well, she's...

12:32.252 --> 12:33.821
Is it a serious relationship?

12:33.854 --> 12:36.423
Yes.
Very serious.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.092
Are you faithful to each other?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.627
No trouble on the horizon?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.932
As far as I know.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.937
As far as you know.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.342
Planning to get married?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.345
We talked about it.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.015
Yes, we will.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.952
Planning to have kids?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.155
No time soon.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.290
You won't be able to discuss
your work with her at all.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.259
Think you'll be able
to handle that?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.795
Absolutely.
We discussed it already.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.464
We're both
totally comfortable with that,

13:17.497 --> 13:20.667
so there is no issue there.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.702
There's no issue there.

13:24.071 --> 13:27.707
You Russian. Her Chinese.
Me nervous.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.510
Why?

13:30.543 --> 13:33.180
Why is the head
of Amaya security nervous

13:33.213 --> 13:35.048
about the Russians
and the Chinese?

13:35.082 --> 13:36.783
Lily is American.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.987
Second...
No, third generation.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.022
You aren't.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.660
Are you religious?

13:47.694 --> 13:49.696
Excuse me?

13:50.864 --> 13:52.866
Are you religious?

13:57.204 --> 13:59.172
No.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.208
Not at all.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.259
Step back, sir.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.533
Get his shoe size?

14:26.566 --> 14:28.535
--I'm a 13.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.571
Okay, guys. I think we're good.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.883
One.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.518
One.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.187
Oh, my God, you guys.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.788
-Two.
-Three.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.723
-Five.
-Eight.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.225
-13.
-21.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.760
-34.
-55.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.529
-89
-1-4-4.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.731
-2-3-3.
-3-7-7.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.268
-6-1-0.
-9-8-7.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.804
-1-5-9-7.
-2-5-8-4.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.274
-Four...
-Hesitation.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.543
-1-8-1.
-6-7-6-5.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.513
One... One...

15:14.581 --> 15:16.950
-Zero.
-Fuck.

15:16.984 --> 15:20.220
-Go on, hit me.
-1-0-9-4-6.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.455
-You got them memorized.
-Nope.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.492
-You're a fucking machine, Lily.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.170
What is it?

15:37.204 --> 15:40.073
Sergei.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.075
He's going in.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.643
Whoa.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.179
Yeah.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.122
So tell me about Devs.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.225
I can't tell you anything.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.461
No one knows
what the Devs team does

16:01.494 --> 16:03.496
except the Devs team.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.466
I wouldn't even say
the Devs team

16:06.499 --> 16:09.502
knows what the Devs team does.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.105
Not all of them, anyway.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
But I'm asking you to guess.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.310
I'm just curious.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.714
Okay.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.316
Well, it's Devs--

16:23.350 --> 16:25.352
it's development, obviously.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.022
But I got a feeling

16:29.056 --> 16:31.358
it's not a progression
of our quantum system

16:31.391 --> 16:33.360
because, in a way,

16:33.393 --> 16:36.729
the system works
as well as it can.

16:36.763 --> 16:40.200
So I assume it's an application
of the system.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.172
But I doubt it's doubling up

16:45.205 --> 16:48.007
with any of the other
Amaya divisions.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.509
So...

16:51.044 --> 16:53.012
...not AI.

16:53.046 --> 16:56.015
Not encryption.

16:56.049 --> 16:59.018
Not search engine.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.921
-Maybe national security.

17:01.954 --> 17:05.758
I don't give two fucks
about national security.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.829
Biotech?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.864
A misuse of resources.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.434
Cold fusion.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.469
Alchemy.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.458
A lead Faraday shield.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.562
A 13-yard-thick concrete shell.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.564
Then a gold mesh.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.266
Then...

18:19.299 --> 18:21.734
an eight-yard vacuum seal,

18:21.768 --> 18:24.137
totally unbroken.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.638
Then the labs.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.341
And, in the core, the machine.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.979
The labs are inside

18:33.012 --> 18:35.014
an unbroken vacuum seal?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.919
How do we get across?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.921
You'll see.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.956
It's pretty neat.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.870
Last chance to guess, Sergei.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.907
-Quantum cell phones.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.656
This entire structure

19:49.689 --> 19:53.125
is supported
by electromagnetic fields?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.696
Yeah.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.395
That's the machine?

20:28.428 --> 20:31.264
It's the central unit.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.367
There's more?

20:34.401 --> 20:37.404
Above us. Below us.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.479
How many qubits is it running?

20:48.515 --> 20:50.650
A number

20:50.683 --> 20:53.686
that seems pointless
to express as a number.

21:10.337 --> 21:13.005
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.480
As in the rest
of the corporation,

21:20.513 --> 21:23.850
we are not interested
in observing weekends.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.619
There are no shifts.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.789
You can work nights if you like,
many do.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.759
One rule to observe:

21:32.792 --> 21:35.662
we take nothing into Devs

21:35.695 --> 21:37.129
and nothing out.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.965
So, no bags, no laptops,

21:38.998 --> 21:41.668
no memory sticks.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.303
Aside from that,
everything here is open.

21:44.337 --> 21:47.540
All code can be accessed.

21:47.574 --> 21:50.943
There are no passwords.
There are no closed doors.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.712
There are also no cleaners,

21:52.745 --> 21:55.548
so please
tidy up after yourself.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.851
This is your station.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.222
If you don't like the position,
you can move to another.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.060
Um...

22:08.094 --> 22:11.564
but what am I actually
doing here?

22:11.598 --> 22:13.833
I'm not gonna tell you.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.868
I won't need to.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.142
Just sit.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.211
Read code.

22:25.244 --> 22:28.014
Take your time.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.617
And don't worry,
you're gonna figure it out.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.086
I know you are.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.691
Here.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.293
Katie. We met earlier,
but weren't introduced.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.195
Sergei.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.833
As Forest told you,

27:13.866 --> 27:15.835
there's no hurry.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.137
You can lose yourself.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.306
You can take your time.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.875
Um, Katie,

27:22.909 --> 27:24.877
I-I need to know.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.146
This code--

27:27.179 --> 27:30.817
is it for real
or is it just theoretical?

27:32.184 --> 27:34.353
It's not theoretical.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.522
You mean you've actually
run the code?

27:36.555 --> 27:38.691
There are results?

27:38.725 --> 27:40.159
Yes.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.798
But...

27:45.832 --> 27:47.834
this changes everything.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.302
If it's true,

27:50.336 --> 27:53.372
it-it literally changes
every single thing.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.674
No.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.610
If it's true
it changes absolutely nothing.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.781
In a way, that's the point.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.663
The universe is deterministic.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.799
S-Sorry?

30:00.833 --> 30:03.669
The universe is deterministic.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.507
It's godless and neutral

30:08.540 --> 30:11.310
and defined
only by physical laws.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.448
The marble rolls
because it was pushed.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.450
The man eats
because he's hungry.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.453
An effect is always the result

30:21.487 --> 30:23.389
of a prior cause.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.160
The life we lead,
with all its apparent chaos,

30:28.194 --> 30:32.031
is actually a life
on tramlines.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.699
Prescribed.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.734
Undeviating.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.769
Deterministic.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.009
I know it doesn't
feel that way, Sergei.

30:43.042 --> 30:46.078
We fall into an illusion
of free will

30:46.112 --> 30:49.648
because the tramlines
are invisible,

30:49.681 --> 30:51.918
and we feel so certain

30:51.951 --> 30:54.320
about our subjective state.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.522
Our feelings, our opinions,

30:56.555 --> 30:58.524
judgments,

30:58.557 --> 31:00.192
decisions.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.431
You joined my company.

31:05.464 --> 31:08.234
You gained our trust.
Gained my trust.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.270
Then stole my code

31:11.303 --> 31:13.539
on your James Bond wristwatch.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.108
I-I don't know what you mean.

31:16.142 --> 31:19.111
That would appear to be
the result of some decisions,

31:19.145 --> 31:21.247
wouldn't it?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.082
About where you placed
your allegiance,

31:23.115 --> 31:25.617
about who you would betray.

31:28.787 --> 31:32.458
But if we live
in a deterministic universe,

31:32.491 --> 31:35.361
then those decisions
can only have been

31:35.394 --> 31:37.396
the result of something prior.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.199
Where you were born,

31:40.232 --> 31:42.969
how you were brought up.

31:43.002 --> 31:46.805
The physical construction
of your particular brain.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.642
It's the nature-nurture matrix.

31:50.676 --> 31:54.080
Exactly like the nematode worm
in your simulation.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.782
It's more complex, more nuanced,
but still...

31:58.517 --> 31:59.818
...at the end of the day,

31:59.851 --> 32:02.654
cause and effect.

32:09.028 --> 32:12.031
I hope you understand
what I'm saying, Sergei.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.302
This is forgiveness.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.639
This is absolution.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.878
You made no decision
to betray me.

32:28.647 --> 32:32.018
You could only have done
what you did.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.514
No! No!

34:31.503 --> 34:34.072
Hello, you have reached
Sergei Pavlov.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.176
I am currently unavailable,
so...

34:41.347 --> 34:43.949
What the fuck?

34:55.127 --> 34:56.762
Lils.
What's up?

34:56.795 --> 34:59.398
He's still not back, Jen.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.233
I'm really worried.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.934
I think something's happened.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.270
Something like what?

35:04.303 --> 35:05.671
I don't know.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.206
S-Something.

35:08.274 --> 35:11.243
Relax.
It's only 12:30.

35:11.277 --> 35:14.112
How many times have you put in
an all-nighter?

35:15.547 --> 35:17.082
I guess.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.617
He'll still be in Devs.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.153
No way there'll be
a phone signal there, right?

35:21.187 --> 35:24.256
Knowing Sergei,
he's lost track of time

35:24.290 --> 35:26.825
from all the cool toys
he's got to play with.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.094
Get some sleep.
And try not to wake up

35:29.127 --> 35:31.129
when he rolls in at 4:00 a.m.

35:32.364 --> 35:35.434
Okay.
Thanks, Jen.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.835
Night, Lils.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.841
No.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.876
No, no.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.266
That was the last time
I saw him.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.334
I was at my office window.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.671
And he was headed towards Devs
from the hub.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.673
And after that, nothing.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.676
And, obviously,
you expected to hear from him.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.110
Definitely.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.881
No trouble at home?

36:55.914 --> 36:58.183
No way he could have gone
somewhere else last night?

36:58.216 --> 36:59.685
You live together, right?

36:59.718 --> 37:01.353
No trouble.
I promise you,

37:01.387 --> 37:04.089
Sergei disappearing
makes no sense at all.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.691
Ma'am, I believe you.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.427
And the good news is that
with our systems here,

37:08.460 --> 37:10.962
his movements
are gonna be easy to track.

37:10.996 --> 37:13.198
Let me just punch his ID in here

37:13.231 --> 37:15.801
and we'll get to the bottom
of this in no time.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.308
Okay.
Here we are.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.979
Let's see...

37:29.615 --> 37:31.983
Looks like he left Devs

37:32.017 --> 37:34.320
quarter of ten last night.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.587
And went where?

37:35.621 --> 37:38.424
Well, this is him, right?

37:40.292 --> 37:41.727
That's him.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.630
Okay.
Let's see where this goes.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.232
Cameras have him crossing
the parking lot

37:47.265 --> 37:50.201
at 10:15.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.472
He's not taking the shuttle bus.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.308
And look--
we have him here again,

37:56.342 --> 37:58.043
10:28.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.012
He's walking to the freeway.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.348
Looks like it.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.249
Why would he do that?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.751
I don't know.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.854
But at this point,
he's off campus.

38:08.887 --> 38:12.090
We can't track him anymore.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.925
Kenton...
Oh...

38:13.959 --> 38:15.427
Sorry to bust in, uh,

38:15.461 --> 38:16.962
but I just need to talk about

38:16.995 --> 38:18.964
that VIP visit that's coming up.

38:18.997 --> 38:22.334
One moment, sir. We seem
to have a situation here. Uh,

38:22.368 --> 38:24.336
One of our employees
has apparently gone missing,

38:24.370 --> 38:25.837
sometime last night.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.873
Missing?

38:29.575 --> 38:32.944
-Who?
-It's the new kid, uh,

38:32.978 --> 38:35.347
just started at Devs.
The one I screened.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.115
Sergei?
From AI?

38:37.148 --> 38:39.385
Yes.
You saw him yesterday?

38:39.418 --> 38:42.120
Sure.
I took him to Devs personally.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.890
But what are you
talking about-- missing?

38:44.923 --> 38:48.827
Our CCTV has him
leaving campus on foot,

38:48.860 --> 38:50.896
2300 hours.
Then nothing.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.330
You're his partner?

38:52.364 --> 38:55.000
-Yes.
-And no calls, no messages?

38:55.033 --> 38:56.502
He never came home?

38:56.535 --> 38:59.337
And that never happens.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.341
Okay. Um...

39:03.375 --> 39:05.076
Now, I don't want you to worry.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.712
I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine,

39:06.745 --> 39:08.414
with a simple explanation.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.382
But just to be on the safe side,

39:10.416 --> 39:12.217
we're gonna go by the book.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.720
Call the police.
Report him missing. Right now.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.155
Yes, sir.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.036
He's gonna turn up, Lils.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.071
It's gonna be all right.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.408
I don't think it is.

39:36.442 --> 39:37.909
But how can you know that?

39:37.943 --> 39:39.845
I just feel it.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.213
If you'd seen the film--

39:42.247 --> 39:46.051
the film of him walking--

39:46.084 --> 39:49.354
there was something strange
about it.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.756
It was, like...

39:50.789 --> 39:53.024
it was, like, purposeful.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.060
Heading somewhere.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.497
Like a zombie.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.301
You've spoken to the cops.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.303
Yes.
They took a statement.

40:05.336 --> 40:08.073
Yeah.
I'm just about to give mine.

40:10.642 --> 40:14.145
And what you are going to do now
is take the rest of the day off.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.782
We have a car
that'll take you home.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.252
Lily...

40:21.286 --> 40:23.789
you have my personal guarantee
that I am all over this.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.943
Sergei?

43:05.583 --> 43:07.585
Hi.

43:16.494 --> 43:18.096
I know.

43:18.129 --> 43:20.131
It's really hard.

43:23.769 --> 43:26.437
It really shouldn't be.

43:26.471 --> 43:28.740
No, it shouldn't.

43:28.774 --> 43:30.776
But it is.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.446
What are we supposed to do?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.448
Unravel a lifetime

43:37.482 --> 43:39.918
of moral experience?

43:39.951 --> 43:42.287
Unlearn what has always
seemed true?

43:44.222 --> 43:46.191
These things...

43:46.224 --> 43:48.226
they run deep.

43:50.528 --> 43:53.164
Yeah.
They do.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.936
It's like whatever we know,
the things we feel

43:57.969 --> 43:59.971
are still locked inside us.

44:02.173 --> 44:06.044
Human beings are hard-wired
magical thinkers.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.113
You could have the most
rational person in the world,

44:08.146 --> 44:10.849
but if their kid gets hurt,
they'll start praying.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.320
Sorry.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.288
That was clumsy.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.324
It's fine, Katie.

44:20.859 --> 44:22.861
You're right.

44:30.736 --> 44:33.471
Not just smarter than me.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.506
Wiser, too.

44:56.561 --> 44:59.264
Sudoku?

44:59.297 --> 45:02.133
You hate sudoku.

45:06.738 --> 45:09.274
Password protected?

45:09.307 --> 45:11.309
What the fuck?

45:22.954 --> 45:24.455
Whoa.

46:12.637 --> 46:14.639
Jamie.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.377
Oh, no.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.390
Can we talk?

46:43.134 --> 46:45.036
Thanks, man.

46:52.410 --> 46:53.811
-Thanks.
-Sure.

47:00.351 --> 47:02.620
I know there's a lot
we need to talk about...

47:02.653 --> 47:04.655
Yeah, there is.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.660
Because here's what happened.

47:11.196 --> 47:13.965
I was completely
in love with you.

47:13.999 --> 47:16.834
And I thought
you were in love with me.

47:16.868 --> 47:20.571
And you-you land an amazing
new job at Amaya, and I...

47:20.605 --> 47:22.573
I couldn't be happier,

47:22.607 --> 47:24.609
'cause you're really
moving forwards in life.

47:26.611 --> 47:29.247
And then the job starts, and...

47:29.280 --> 47:31.249
I don't know.

47:31.282 --> 47:33.851
Almost at once,
something changes.

47:33.885 --> 47:37.555
And I realize you're not just
moving forward with the job,

47:37.588 --> 47:39.590
you're moving forwards from me.

47:41.059 --> 47:44.729
So eventually I ask
if you want to split up.

47:44.762 --> 47:47.498
And I'm hoping
more than anything

47:47.532 --> 47:50.235
you're gonna say no, but...

47:50.268 --> 47:52.237
you say yes.

47:52.270 --> 47:53.905
And that same afternoon

47:53.939 --> 47:57.208
I leave our apartment
with two bags.

47:57.242 --> 48:00.545
And I never hear from you again.

48:00.578 --> 48:02.013
I'm sorry.

48:02.047 --> 48:04.282
I hear about you, though.

48:04.315 --> 48:06.117
I hear about you the whole time.

48:06.151 --> 48:08.119
I hear you started seeing

48:08.153 --> 48:10.421
some AI coder called Sergei.

48:11.456 --> 48:12.857
And I hear that he's moved into

48:12.890 --> 48:15.360
the apartment we used to share,

48:15.393 --> 48:17.395
but I don't hear from you.

48:18.964 --> 48:21.799
For two years.

48:24.402 --> 48:25.803
I'm sorry.

48:27.605 --> 48:29.574
Is that why you're here--

48:29.607 --> 48:31.609
to tell me that?

48:33.078 --> 48:34.545
No.

48:34.579 --> 48:35.981
Then what?

48:38.950 --> 48:41.452
I need your help.

48:42.853 --> 48:45.156
My help?

48:45.190 --> 48:47.192
Yes.

48:48.493 --> 48:49.927
With what?

48:55.333 --> 48:58.769
Sergei went missing last night.

48:58.803 --> 49:02.607
And I know something bad
has happened to him.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.510
And there's something weird
on his phone,

49:05.543 --> 49:07.645
and it's password protected,

49:07.678 --> 49:10.948
and says it'll reformat
if I get the password wrong.

49:14.185 --> 49:15.920
Jamie...

49:15.953 --> 49:18.423
if there was
anyone else I could ask,

49:18.456 --> 49:20.125
I would.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.967
But nobody's better
at this stuff than you.

49:32.403 --> 49:35.706
So you want my help
to track down your boyfriend

49:35.740 --> 49:38.509
by cracking his phone?

49:42.680 --> 49:45.350
Yeah.

49:52.257 --> 49:54.859
Unreal.
Literally unreal.

49:54.892 --> 49:56.861
Lily, sincerely,

49:56.894 --> 49:59.364
from the very bottom
of my heart,

49:59.397 --> 50:01.499
fuck off.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.548
Jen, what is it--
did they find him?

50:50.581 --> 50:53.017
Lils, get dressed.
I got a call to pick you up.

50:53.050 --> 50:55.052
They need you to come in
right now.

51:51.142 --> 51:53.110
It's definitely him?

51:53.144 --> 51:55.146
Definitely him.

52:19.904 --> 52:21.939
No. No.

52:21.972 --> 52:23.474
Lily...

55:52.216 --> 55:54.218

55:57.021 --> 55:59.289
Pulling hair is wrong, mate.

55:59.390 --> 56:02.593
I mean, all violence is wrong,
but at least punching's a sport.

56:02.627 --> 56:04.194
-Is it?
-Yes, boxing.

56:04.228 --> 56:06.296
Boxing's in the Olympics.
Hair pulling isn't.

56:07.532 --> 56:10.568
-It would be funny if it was.
-It really would be.

56:16.907 --> 56:19.444
-I'm a
once-in-a-generation artist.
-Oh.

56:19.477 --> 56:22.580
Who just got verified
on Twitter, about,
what, nine days ago?

56:22.613 --> 56:24.882
I'm glad you feel good
that a robot told you
you're worth it.

56:33.090 --> 56:34.391
-Mom.
-Yes?

56:34.425 --> 56:36.794
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

56:36.827 --> 56:39.063
-I want a quinceañera.
-Quinceañera?

56:39.096 --> 56:42.433
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

56:51.742 --> 56:54.679
Do me a favor?
Never look me in the eye again.

56:54.779 --> 56:57.682
Okay? 'Cause your stare
is way too intense.

56:57.782 --> 56:59.517
It's starting to make
my hair fall out.

57:05.355 --> 57:07.592
I had no idea
what I would find

57:07.625 --> 57:09.426
when I went searching
for my father.

57:09.460 --> 57:12.196
They flashed the Zodiac Killer,
and my heart stopped.

57:12.296 --> 57:14.965
He believes
he is the son of the Zodiac.
