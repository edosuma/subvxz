02:10.400 --> 02:12.040
Don't look now.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.040
- But I think
- that guy's looking at you.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.040
He's cute.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.260
Please, I don't want to be

02:21.261 --> 02:22.440
at any table

02:22.480 --> 02:23.920
where the conversation includes

02:23.921 --> 02:25.360
the sentence "he's cute".

02:25.400 --> 02:27.080
He looks a lot like...

02:28.880 --> 02:30.320
He's cute.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.960
Okay, once more and I'm leaving.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.200
I don't know, I'm not really...

02:34.240 --> 02:35.640
WHOA here he is.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.400
[with Italian accent]

02:39.401 --> 02:40.720
Buona Sera! May I sit?

02:42.880 --> 02:44.800
- [Vincent] (GROANS) Gosh,
- I don't know,

02:44.840 --> 02:46.380
There's already three of us

02:46.381 --> 02:47.920
and I kinda like to sprawl out.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.760
I hear this gelateria

02:58.761 --> 02:59.960
has gelato.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.160
Mia, do you want to go get some?

03:08.720 --> 03:09.760
[huffs]

03:10.880 --> 03:12.080
I'll have some.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.720
I am Prince Alessandro.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.400
Prince?

03:18.440 --> 03:20.920
You really remind me of someone.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.240
I could not help but notice you.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.640
Even from afar

03:24.641 --> 03:26.000
you have a look that is,

03:26.040 --> 03:28.640
how do you say, "like royalty".

03:29.800 --> 03:30.840
- Regal?

03:30.841 --> 03:31.880
- Yes! Regal!

03:36.760 --> 03:39.160
Come, I'll buy you gelato!

03:39.200 --> 03:40.600
Okay!

03:45.680 --> 03:47.120
So I forgot these ice creams

03:47.121 --> 03:48.560
were huge!

03:48.600 --> 03:50.360
[giggles]

03:50.400 --> 03:52.180
Like...

03:52.181 --> 03:53.960
Chocolate, strawberry... well...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.160
It was huge!

03:56.200 --> 03:57.560
Actually

03:57.561 --> 03:58.920
I didn't ate it all... no.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.920
- So big!
- Really?

04:00.960 --> 04:02.680
- [Alessandro] Yeah, and free...
- [Mia] Oh!

04:02.720 --> 04:04.680
- There's something
- I don't like about that guy.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.520
Do you think I'm "regal"?

04:11.160 --> 04:12.360
At all?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.000
Vincent?

04:16.040 --> 04:17.440
Vincent?!

04:19.720 --> 04:21.440
- I'm done!
- Excuse me for a second.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.160
Wow!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.200
Watch out!

04:26.240 --> 04:27.960
Chocolate... strawberry...

04:28.000 --> 04:29.560
Excuse me...

04:29.600 --> 04:30.760
Yes?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.840
I, was going to figure out

04:32.880 --> 04:34.656
- the rest of what to say
- on the way over here,

04:34.680 --> 04:35.920
But the walk was a lot shorter

04:35.921 --> 04:37.160
than I remembered.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.600
[exhales]

04:38.640 --> 04:40.360
- You know this...
- messy peasant?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.760
MESSY?!

04:41.800 --> 04:43.640
"Peasant"? How dare you?

04:43.680 --> 04:45.080
Vincent, just forget it.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.760
Let's go sit down.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.536
- Just because
- you're some exotic foreign guy

04:48.560 --> 04:49.936
- With an accent
- you think you can just...

04:49.960 --> 04:51.240
Say...

04:51.280 --> 04:52.440
things?!

04:52.480 --> 04:54.800
He's funny, this guy.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.800
Um... Excuse me for a second.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.696
- Vincent, do you think
- you could grab my backpack?

04:58.720 --> 05:00.160
I forgot it at the table.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.240
What for?

05:01.280 --> 05:02.600
For carrying things.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.360
Like books.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.640
What?

05:07.640 --> 05:08.880
OH! Right...

05:08.920 --> 05:10.040
Okay.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.120
[pants]

05:22.160 --> 05:23.320
What?!

05:23.360 --> 05:25.040
We're in a main walk-way!

05:25.080 --> 05:26.856
- What am I supposed to do
- if somebody comes?!

05:26.880 --> 05:28.280
I don't know. Improvise.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.360
Improvise?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.280
SKUNK!

05:34.000 --> 05:35.040
[laughs]

05:47.000 --> 05:48.240
Say your password.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.360
"Across the bridge, very near,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.600
not for sadness, shed a tear."

06:06.400 --> 06:09.840
[screams]

06:12.680 --> 06:13.840
[Mia] Aaaaaaahhh...

06:13.880 --> 06:15.440
Huh?!

06:15.480 --> 06:18.920
Aaaaahhhh...

06:18.960 --> 06:20.560
Whooaaa!

06:20.600 --> 06:21.640
[neighs slightly]

06:23.280 --> 06:24.880
Are you okay?

06:24.920 --> 06:26.600
Get me out of here!

06:28.240 --> 06:29.520
Whoa...

06:29.560 --> 06:30.800
I don't know if your aim

06:30.840 --> 06:33.080
is getting better or worse.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.000
Sorry, windy today.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.880
- Didn't mean to dive bomb
- you like that.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.160
[snorts]

06:38.200 --> 06:40.080
I missed you, boy.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.000
[neighs]

06:42.040 --> 06:43.100
Wish you'd "missed" me!

06:43.101 --> 06:44.160
[giggles]

06:44.200 --> 06:46.280
Ha. Ha. Very funny.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.520
[laughs]

06:47.560 --> 06:49.040
Okay, check out this new oracle.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.560
"Across the bridge, very near,

06:51.600 --> 06:54.400
not for sadness, shed a tear."

06:54.440 --> 06:55.900
Hmm. There are

06:55.901 --> 06:57.360
two bridges south of here.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.640
Another to the north.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.120
A couple to the east.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.220
It's pretty much

07:01.221 --> 07:02.280
"bridge central".

07:02.320 --> 07:04.120
Could be any of them.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.440
- But why would you shed a tear
- if you weren't sad?

07:06.480 --> 07:07.860
Beats me.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.240
Maybe Mo can help figure it out.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.120
- [Mayla and Reynor]
- (SHIVERING) Oohh...

07:21.160 --> 07:23.320
Ooh...

07:23.360 --> 07:25.200
- Feeling any better today,
- majesties?

07:25.240 --> 07:26.360
- Ouuuh...
- Ouuuh...

07:26.400 --> 07:28.080
[sneezes]

07:28.120 --> 07:29.600
Be glad you don't have

07:29.601 --> 07:31.080
the Ganuvian Chills, Mo.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.960
Ugh! It's awful!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.240
AAATCHOO!

07:35.241 --> 07:36.480
Oh, indeed.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.000
And it seems

07:38.001 --> 07:39.480
half of Centopia's down with it.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.720
- You know
- what would cure it really quick?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.320
Unicorn tears!

07:44.640 --> 07:46.040
Too bad we don't have any.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.400
Hmm... Never mind that, Phuddle.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.840
I can't laze around

07:54.841 --> 07:56.240
my bedchamber any longer.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.080
ATCHOO!

08:00.120 --> 08:01.380
Raynor, you're too sick

08:01.381 --> 08:02.640
to review the troops.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.120
And with that sniffle,

08:04.160 --> 08:06.760
forget about royal audiences.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.120
Well,

08:08.121 --> 08:09.440
the kingdom won't run itself.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.080
No, it won't. Which is

08:11.081 --> 08:12.680
why Mo should take the throne

08:12.720 --> 08:14.320
while we recover.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.360
Really? Wooo!

08:16.400 --> 08:17.920
Me? King?!

08:17.960 --> 08:19.600
That would be awesome.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.780
Uh, I mean,

08:21.781 --> 08:23.920
it would be an honor to serve.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.920
Being King is not easy, Mo.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.420
You must be wise,

08:27.421 --> 08:28.880
and you must be strong.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.520
And you must never eat anything

08:30.560 --> 08:32.000
without having somebody

08:32.001 --> 08:33.440
taste it first.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.640
Someone's trying

08:34.640 --> 08:35.799
to poison the king?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.080
It's not poison.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.120
It's Phuddle's cooking.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.559
Uck!

08:40.600 --> 08:41.620
I'm standing right here,

08:41.621 --> 08:42.640
you know!

08:42.679 --> 08:45.200
Okay. Be wise, be strong.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.420
And don't forget to review

08:46.421 --> 08:47.600
the troops.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.380
And remember to start royal

08:49.381 --> 08:51.120
audiences promptly at noon.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.080
- Phuddle will help you
- with the schedule.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.760
And most important of all...

08:56.800 --> 08:58.640
Whatever you do, ehh...

08:58.680 --> 09:00.180
- Don't fly my balloon throne.

09:00.181 --> 09:01.680
- Why not?

09:01.720 --> 09:03.720
- Ehh...
- You don't know how to steer it,

09:03.760 --> 09:05.560
And you might get hurt.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.820
- I can handle it...

09:06.821 --> 09:08.040
- [Raynor] No, you can't.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.420
And anyway,

09:09.421 --> 09:10.760
I just had it washed.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.400
Mm... And painted.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.480
And... and it's mine!

09:15.520 --> 09:17.680
Oooo... kay.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.060
Well, I'm off

09:19.061 --> 09:20.400
to start the reign of King Mo,

09:20.440 --> 09:21.480
the...

09:21.520 --> 09:22.800
Lion-hearted.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.800
Hey, I like the sound of that!

09:27.680 --> 09:28.720
[coughs]

09:28.760 --> 09:30.360
[Raynor]Phuddle?!

09:30.400 --> 09:32.080
- [Phuddle]
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Sorry...

09:32.960 --> 09:34.320
[Mo] Hey you there!

09:34.360 --> 09:36.600
Bring that over here, and you!

09:36.640 --> 09:38.000
Make yourself useful

09:38.001 --> 09:39.360
and move that over there.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.480
No, no no.

09:40.520 --> 09:41.920
That's far enough.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.880
[hums]

09:45.720 --> 09:47.040
[giggle]

09:47.080 --> 09:48.600
[Yuko] Does your father know

09:48.640 --> 09:49.816
- you're goofing around
- on his throne?

09:49.840 --> 09:50.920
I'm not goofing.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.280
My parents are sick,

09:52.320 --> 09:54.280
so guess who's in charge now?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.800
Really?

09:55.840 --> 09:57.960
- You're king of Centopia?!
- Yep.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.880
Which sounds better?

09:59.881 --> 10:01.760
King Mo the Lionhearted or Mo,

10:01.800 --> 10:03.920
King of the Known World?

10:03.960 --> 10:06.000
How about King Mo,

10:06.001 --> 10:08.040
the Trying Too Hard?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.320
So now that you're king,

10:09.321 --> 10:10.560
do we have to bow?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.780
Good question.

10:11.781 --> 10:12.960
His majesty will think

10:13.000 --> 10:14.640
- about it
- and get back to you.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.680
I'd say his crown is too tight,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.520
but he's not wearing one.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.960
[clears throat]

10:20.000 --> 10:21.800
- For my first official act
- as king,

10:21.840 --> 10:23.720
- We will locate
- the Trumptus piece

10:23.760 --> 10:25.600
And deliver it to the palace.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.920
A simple,

10:26.960 --> 10:28.160
"Hey guys,

10:28.200 --> 10:29.440
go look for the Trumptus piece"

10:29.480 --> 10:30.520
would've sufficed.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.800
The oracle said

10:31.840 --> 10:33.760
"Across the bridge, very near,

10:33.800 --> 10:36.640
not for sadness, shed a tear."

10:36.680 --> 10:39.080
Hmm... this is a long shot,

10:39.120 --> 10:40.580
but maybe it means

10:40.581 --> 10:42.040
the Sparkle Pollen Fields.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.280
Oh yeah!

10:43.320 --> 10:44.760
All that pollen would make

10:44.800 --> 10:46.280
your eyes water like crazy.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.460
And the Altalor Bridge

10:47.461 --> 10:48.600
leads there.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.440
That could be it! Let's go!

10:50.480 --> 10:51.760
Hi Phuddle, bye Phuddle.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.080
[Phuddle] Where are you going?

10:55.120 --> 10:57.000
- The king doesn't get
- to go on adventures.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.840
Aw, I forgot.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.040
I have to do king stuff.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.440
[Phuddle] Let's see...

11:02.480 --> 11:04.040
first on the agenda,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.480
- inspecting
- the new royal china patterns...

11:06.520 --> 11:08.000
Guards!

11:08.960 --> 11:10.040
[grunts]

11:11.960 --> 11:14.520
You have one hour.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.520
Are you sure you don't need me?

11:16.560 --> 11:19.320
We can handle it, your highness.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.560
[laugh]

11:23.400 --> 11:24.920
[Yuko laughs]

11:24.960 --> 11:27.320
"King of the Known World."

11:27.360 --> 11:29.240
[both laugh]

11:29.280 --> 11:30.420
"His majesty

11:30.421 --> 11:31.560
will think about it".

11:32.800 --> 11:34.720
I sorta feel bad for him.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.940
You know, someday Mo's gonna be

11:36.941 --> 11:39.120
the real king of Centopia.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.580
Yeah.

11:40.581 --> 11:42.000
And he's going to need a queen.

11:43.600 --> 11:44.680
Is this the bridge

11:44.681 --> 11:45.760
Mo was talking about?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.200
Yup! The Altalor Bridge.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.120
- And there's
- the Sparkle Pollen Fields.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.560
[Mia] They look beautiful.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.200
How bad can they be?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.480
[sneezes]

11:54.520 --> 11:56.640
Does that answer your question?

11:56.680 --> 11:58.520
Yup! Pretty bad.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.920
[Panthea] That bridge is

12:07.921 --> 12:09.480
the only way into the Fields.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.860
It's simple.

12:10.861 --> 12:12.200
Chase the unicorns across it.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.560
Then destroy it.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.120
They'll be trapped.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.200
Meow.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.600
But Panthea, be merciful!

12:19.640 --> 12:21.020
The pollen is thicker

12:21.021 --> 12:22.400
than ever this time of year!

12:22.440 --> 12:24.480
There is no defense against it,

12:24.520 --> 12:26.400
not masks, not herbs...

12:26.440 --> 12:27.640
Well, you can either

12:27.641 --> 12:28.840
go to the Pollen Fields

12:28.880 --> 12:30.340
or gut this fish

12:30.341 --> 12:31.800
for Ziggo's dinner.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.000
Ow!

12:33.040 --> 12:34.360
Eww.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.720
As you wish...

12:36.760 --> 12:38.680
[to herself] Hideous old crone.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.280
What was that?

12:40.320 --> 12:41.600
Um... I said...

12:41.640 --> 12:43.800
I better get going.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.280
Really, Ziggo,

12:45.320 --> 12:46.660
I don't know why

12:46.661 --> 12:48.000
I keep her around.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.140
The king thanks you

12:52.141 --> 12:53.760
for your humble gift of this...

12:53.800 --> 12:54.880
plant.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.080
And I have to say

12:56.120 --> 12:57.520
I've never seen anyone bow

12:57.560 --> 12:59.120
for twenty minutes before.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.560
[Mo] Thank you.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.720
Is that all the audiences?

13:07.760 --> 13:08.860
Can I maybe

13:08.861 --> 13:09.960
go find Yuko and Mia now?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.660
Nope. You still have to pose

13:11.661 --> 13:13.320
for a royal portrait.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.080
Ugh! Move that to tomorrow!

13:16.120 --> 13:18.560
It's on the agenda, sire.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.740
I'm the king!

13:19.741 --> 13:20.880
I postpone it!

13:20.920 --> 13:23.320
Ugh! Very well, sire.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.440
[guard coughs]

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
Looks like even you guys

13:27.481 --> 13:28.481
are getting sick.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.400
- Your benevolent
- and merciful king

13:30.440 --> 13:31.660
Dismisses you

13:31.661 --> 13:32.880
to go home and rest.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.740
I bet Yuko and Mia

13:37.741 --> 13:39.360
are having more fun than this.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.000
Wow, this pollen is nasty!

13:47.040 --> 13:48.240
AATCHOO!

13:48.280 --> 13:50.120
ATCHOO!

13:50.160 --> 13:52.200
[snorts and neighs]

13:53.080 --> 13:54.360
Really, Onchao?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.200
Onchao says... [sneezes]

13:56.240 --> 13:57.360
the Trumptus piece

13:57.361 --> 13:58.480
is definitely here.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.240
- But with all this pollen,
- [sneezes]

14:00.280 --> 14:02.320
It's going to be hard to find.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.480
[sneezes]

14:03.520 --> 14:04.640
Better get looking.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.760
ATCHOO!

14:05.800 --> 14:07.240
I'll look over there.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.880
- Onchao and I
- will look over here.

14:08.920 --> 14:09.960
ATCHOO!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.040
[distant gallop]

14:11.080 --> 14:12.440
What's that?

14:13.760 --> 14:15.280
[Yuko] That's weird.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.420
I thought unicorns

14:16.421 --> 14:17.520
hated this pollen.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.020
So why are they in such a hurry

14:19.021 --> 14:20.480
to get here?!

14:20.520 --> 14:21.600
[shrieking]

14:21.640 --> 14:23.000
Uh-oh.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.200
Father said not to fly it.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.560
Nothing wrong with

14:35.561 --> 14:36.680
just sitting in it.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.680
Maybe I can spot Yuko and Mia.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.240
Whoa!

15:00.680 --> 15:02.720
All quiet on the home front.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.480
Oh no!

15:08.600 --> 15:10.200
This is not good!

15:10.240 --> 15:11.520
[Gargona] Ha ha!

15:13.920 --> 15:16.600
[Gargona] Round up the Unicorns!

15:16.640 --> 15:17.960
[neighing]

15:18.000 --> 15:19.240
[laughs maniacally]

15:19.280 --> 15:20.840
ACHOO!

15:20.880 --> 15:23.600
Blasted [sneezes] pollen!

15:23.640 --> 15:25.200
We gotta help them!

15:26.600 --> 15:27.680
If that bridge goes out

15:27.681 --> 15:28.760
[sneezes]

15:28.800 --> 15:30.320
the unicorns will be trapped!

15:30.360 --> 15:31.460
We need help, big time!

15:31.461 --> 15:32.560
DING!

15:32.600 --> 15:34.280
I know, I know!

15:34.320 --> 15:36.320
- But the king's not allowed
- to go into battle!

15:36.360 --> 15:38.760
Guards! I need a dozen soldiers!

15:38.800 --> 15:41.600
Hello?! Anybody?!

15:41.640 --> 15:43.240
Oh, right.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.500
Their "wise" king

15:44.501 --> 15:45.720
gave them the day off.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.680
That's just great.

15:47.720 --> 15:48.960
Eat water, Gargona!

15:49.000 --> 15:50.040
Aaah!

15:51.640 --> 15:52.720
We gotta find that piece

15:52.721 --> 15:53.800
and get out of here!

15:53.840 --> 15:55.340
When you have some spare time

15:55.341 --> 15:56.840
to look for it, let me know!

15:56.880 --> 15:58.960
Onchao?! Where are you going?!

16:05.000 --> 16:06.080
Oh no!

16:06.120 --> 16:07.480
[Mo] Oh oh...

16:07.520 --> 16:08.840
Those unicorns will never

16:08.880 --> 16:10.360
be able to jump that gap!

16:12.640 --> 16:13.980
Time for

16:13.981 --> 16:15.320
some fast bridge repair.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.680
Forget the rules.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.280
Mia and Yuko need me!

16:19.800 --> 16:21.080
Whoa!

16:21.081 --> 16:22.360
Who designed this steering?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.800
[Mo] Oh right. Thanks Phuddle.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.600
Face it elves.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.280
You're losing!

16:29.320 --> 16:31.160
WAACHOO!

16:31.200 --> 16:32.320
Aaagh!

16:32.360 --> 16:34.040
[grunts]

16:34.080 --> 16:37.440
Wow! Go blow your nose, Gargona!

16:37.480 --> 16:38.960
Aaagh!

16:47.480 --> 16:48.560
[neighs]

16:48.600 --> 16:51.160
Whaat?! Well, hello!

16:51.200 --> 16:52.240
[neighs]

16:54.680 --> 16:56.600
Huh? Where did he go?

16:56.640 --> 16:59.280
Oh little unicorn?

16:59.320 --> 17:01.040
- [neighs]
- Ooh!

17:01.080 --> 17:02.440
AAAH!

17:12.560 --> 17:15.119
Onchao! The trumptus piece!

17:15.160 --> 17:16.400
He found it!

17:16.440 --> 17:17.920
[Mo] I thought you girls said

17:17.960 --> 17:19.760
- you could handle this
- on your own!

17:19.800 --> 17:21.140
Don't worry.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.480
I'll get them out of here!

17:23.920 --> 17:25.480
[Mo] Unicorn tears!

17:25.520 --> 17:27.400
Man, we could use those!

17:27.440 --> 17:29.280
Hey! Where are you going?

17:38.320 --> 17:40.120
[Mo] Just fits!

17:42.600 --> 17:43.920
[Mo] Okay! Let's save

17:43.921 --> 17:45.240
those unicorns.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.000
Onchao! Get those unicorns

17:53.001 --> 17:54.200
across the bridge!

17:54.240 --> 17:55.680
We'll take care of the muncs.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.480
[neighs]

18:04.720 --> 18:06.280
[neighing]

18:11.640 --> 18:12.680
Got it!

18:17.720 --> 18:19.280
- WAPUSH!
- [Mia] AAACKK!

18:19.320 --> 18:21.120
Mia!

18:21.160 --> 18:23.160
Take the piece and go!

18:23.200 --> 18:25.040
Yeah, right!

18:25.080 --> 18:26.960
Oh-oh! Hold still!

18:27.000 --> 18:28.040
[hissing]

18:29.720 --> 18:31.640
[grunts with effort]

18:31.680 --> 18:33.480
Now run!

18:33.520 --> 18:35.520
C'mon, we're done here!

18:45.400 --> 18:47.440
C'mon!

18:47.480 --> 18:49.560
Mia, Yuko!

18:49.600 --> 18:52.080
[Yuko] Anytime now, Mo!

18:52.120 --> 18:53.520
I'm trying!

18:53.560 --> 18:55.200
But the throne is stuck!

18:55.240 --> 18:57.040
Uh-oh!

18:57.080 --> 19:00.440
Jump with me! Ready? Jump!

19:02.280 --> 19:04.080
[Mo] We did it! C'mon Onchao!

19:08.400 --> 19:11.080
Ugh! Don't just stand there!

19:11.120 --> 19:13.000
Fly after them!

19:13.040 --> 19:14.480
Dragons!

19:19.040 --> 19:21.240
[shriek]

19:21.280 --> 19:23.120
Watch where you're going!

19:23.160 --> 19:24.400
ATCHOO!

19:24.440 --> 19:25.600
Useless!

19:25.640 --> 19:27.960
You're all useless!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.120
AAACHOOOO!

19:40.200 --> 19:41.560
[Mayla] Uh! Don't come

19:41.561 --> 19:42.920
too close.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.200
We're all contagious!

19:45.240 --> 19:47.040
Not for long.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.880
Nothing beats unicorn tears.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.640
Aah, now that's better!

20:01.680 --> 20:03.280
[sighs]

20:03.320 --> 20:04.800
Courtesy of King Mo,

20:04.801 --> 20:06.280
the lion hearted.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.880
But since you're up,

20:07.881 --> 20:09.440
I guess he'd be Prince Mo now.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.400
And courtesy of Onchao,

20:11.440 --> 20:13.000
there's also this.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.480
Ah, excellent!

20:14.520 --> 20:16.600
Another piece of the trumptus.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.000
Only seven pieces left

20:18.001 --> 20:19.360
to discover.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.900
[Raynor] Victory is

20:20.901 --> 20:22.400
within our reach!

20:22.440 --> 20:24.300
Well Mo! It seems your reign

20:24.301 --> 20:26.160
has been successful.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.960
What? Yeah, um, great.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.200
- Well,
- now that I'm back on my feet,

20:32.240 --> 20:34.000
Perhaps I'll have a sit.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.280
On my balloon throne!

20:36.320 --> 20:38.240
Why don't you join me, Mo?

20:38.280 --> 20:39.820
You can tell me all about

20:39.821 --> 20:41.360
your exciting day as King.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.480
Oh, yeah.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.400
About the balloon throne...

20:54.200 --> 20:55.800
I'm sorry.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.600
Was there a good reason?

20:57.640 --> 20:58.720
- Sort of...

20:58.721 --> 20:59.800
- Totally!

20:59.840 --> 21:01.680
- If he hadn't brought
- the balloon, we never

21:01.720 --> 21:03.536
- Would have been able
- to save those unicorns!

21:03.560 --> 21:05.160
It was heroic, really!

21:05.200 --> 21:06.960
I'd even call it "kingly"!

21:07.000 --> 21:09.120
Son, you did disobey me.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.360
But you did it

21:10.361 --> 21:11.560
for the right reasons.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.800
And that kind of judgment

21:13.801 --> 21:16.000
is what makes a king a king.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.240
And anyway,

21:17.280 --> 21:19.560
the balloon can always be fixed.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.440
Agh... agh...

21:21.480 --> 21:24.320
Easy for you to say!

21:24.360 --> 21:26.400
Mo, you could help him.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.040
I can deal with that punishment.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.360
I can deal with anything.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.280
Except royal audiences.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.960
Man, that is one boring job!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.600
[Raynor laughs]

21:35.640 --> 21:36.960
You'll be doing it

21:36.961 --> 21:38.280
full time soon enough.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.800
Oh no! My battery! Oof!

21:42.840 --> 21:44.600
- I'd love to stay and help,
- but...

21:44.640 --> 21:46.120
[Phuddle] Ah don't worry.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.400
I've got everything

21:47.401 --> 21:48.640
under control.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.040
Oh... oh... Uh-oooh!

21:50.080 --> 21:51.320
Bye everyone!

21:51.360 --> 21:53.320
[Phuddle] Woooo...

21:54.920 --> 21:57.360
OUH! Aaaagh!

21:59.880 --> 22:01.600
- You're not really going to
- let that guy

22:01.640 --> 22:03.240
Buy you gelato, are you?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.440
I don't know.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.400
He reminds me of someone.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.080
I think I can guess.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.560
That's definitely not Mo.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.736
Do you want to get out of here?

22:23.760 --> 22:25.280
Do I ever.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.280
I got this.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.800
Hey... You know,

22:30.840 --> 22:32.180
I didn't actually

22:32.181 --> 22:33.520
get any gelato.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.840
Not in your mouth, anyway.

22:34.880 --> 22:35.880
[laugh]
