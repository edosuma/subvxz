WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:04.588
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.671 --> 00:07.966
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.050 --> 00:11.512
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.595 --> 00:14.640
On which we used to rely?

00:14.723 --> 00:18.018
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:18.101 --> 00:21.522
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.605 --> 00:23.398
All the things
that make us

00:23.482 --> 00:25.025
Laugh and cry

00:25.108 --> 00:29.738
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:33.742 --> 00:35.744
Okay, now, don't wander
too far, kids.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.204
You know,
more children get kidnapped

00:37.287 --> 00:39.248
at the grocery store
than anywhere else.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.087
Hey.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.296
Ah, you got me!

00:46.380 --> 00:47.756
Oh, not quick enough.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.258
Not quick enough,
no.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.509
No, I was close,
though.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.177
You were close.

00:54.263 --> 00:56.098
I'm gonna go get
some oranges, Stewie.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.475
Here, hold the rest of
these bags for Mommy.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.018
Oh, what brilliant parenting,
Lois.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.437
Leave a tiny infant
with a plastic bag.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.273
You know,
I might asphyxiate myself,

01:04.356 --> 01:05.524
just to teach you a lesson.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.944
Here I go,
just like that boy from INXS.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.280
I am going to do it.
I am going to do it.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.282
(grunting)

01:13.365 --> 01:15.117
Blast! Good lord, Lois,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.786
either I was a C-section
or you're Wonder Woman.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.288
Chris, would you run
and get some milk?

01:19.371 --> 01:21.206
And be sure to
take it from the back.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.253
("Take on Me" by A-Ha playing)

01:26.336 --> 01:28.088
Take on me

01:28.172 --> 01:32.050
Take me on

01:32.134 --> 01:33.927
Take on me

01:34.011 --> 01:37.890
I'll be gone

01:37.973 --> 01:43.145
In a day or two

02:02.956 --> 02:04.625
(panting)

02:04.708 --> 02:05.751
Chris,
where have you been?

02:05.834 --> 02:07.336
I don't know.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.379
(beeps)

02:09.463 --> 02:10.756
$53.98.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.008
Oh, no,
I forgot to go to the bank.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.384
Uh, I'm a little short.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.303
I'll have to
put the ham back.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.855
You know, I got some candy in my van,
if your kid wants some.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.774
Oh, great!
(gasps)

02:28.857 --> 02:30.108
Wait a second!

02:30.192 --> 02:32.653
Ah, you got me!
You got me.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.737
-(laughing)
-Oh, man.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.489
I'll get him, though.
I'll get him.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.408
I bet you will.
I bet you will.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.374
Hey, is that ham?
I thought you put that back.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.875
Oh, um...

02:46.959 --> 02:49.002
No, I put
the other ham back.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.504
I don't remember
another ham.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.840
Well, you were too busy
eyeballing that Redbook

02:52.923 --> 02:54.508
with Glenn Close
on the cover.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.176
Hey, she is
a handsome woman.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.845
Well, well!
Look who's carrying

02:57.928 --> 02:59.263
a little flame
for Glenn Close.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.597
What a surprise!

03:00.681 --> 03:03.141
Although it's not the first time
you've surprised me.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.102
Oh, I have so much
stuff to do today.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.104
I have to do laundry,
then I have a piano lesson,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.689
then I have to make dinner.
I am so busy.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.773
Better hurry.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.817
Lois, I want
my graham cracker...

03:11.900 --> 03:12.985
Oh.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.696
Hey.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.407
Hey.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.492
Playing
a little dress-up?

03:21.994 --> 03:23.287
Yeah.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.914
Yeah, good.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.583
It's fun to pretend.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.210
Um, so listen,
if you see Lois tell her--

03:30.294 --> 03:31.420
-Graham cracker.
-Graham cracker.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.338
Yes, yes.
That's--that's it.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.341
Um, all right, so, uh,

03:36.425 --> 03:38.010
I'm just gonna go out
in the hallway

03:38.093 --> 03:40.012
and throw up
about something else.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.560
Oh, this is cute.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.520
Oh, my God.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.484
(laughing)

03:56.445 --> 03:58.780
(whooping)

04:04.119 --> 04:05.120
(panting)

04:06.914 --> 04:09.291
Oh, my God,
that was such a rush.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.375
(grunting)

04:10.459 --> 04:13.128
Yeah. I'm alive!

04:15.797 --> 04:17.424
Thanks for
having us over.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.051
Yeah,
it's a wonderful dinner.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.094
And on this
beautiful new china.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.305
You guys have
a lot of new stuff.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.432
Yeah, Lois has been
splurging her ass off.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.850
Yeah, she has.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.852
You know, she bought me
something yesterday,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.395
but I--I am not going to
tell you what it is.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.189
I want you to guess.
Just c-close your eyes.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.315
(honking)

04:33.398 --> 04:34.399
(groaning)

04:34.483 --> 04:35.817
It's a soccer horn.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.194
I know what it is!

04:37.277 --> 04:39.279
Hey, is that
an original Matisse?

04:39.363 --> 04:40.822
Uh, hey, uh, Bonnie.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.908
Uh, listen, why
don't you stop with the questions, huh?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.910
You're ruining
everyone's good time.

04:44.993 --> 04:48.121
Like Peter did, when he used
to entertain terminally ill kids.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.748
Hi there.
How you all doin'?

04:49.831 --> 04:51.667
All right, so I'm at
the DMV the other day.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.086
Long lines.
Long lines at the DMV.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.922
But you'll find out
all about that when you get...

04:58.590 --> 05:00.092
(stammering)

05:00.175 --> 05:03.470
Um, movin' on. So, uh,
I finally tried Viagra and--

05:03.554 --> 05:04.638
(boy groaning)

05:04.721 --> 05:06.807
Oh, we got a joker
in the audience there.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.726
You, uh, you got something
you want to say, there, Mr. Heckler?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.395
Dying hurts.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.604
Tell me about it.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.064
So anyway,
who hates flyin'?

05:21.905 --> 05:22.906
(clearing throat)

05:22.990 --> 05:24.741
(gasping)
Brian, what are you doin' here?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.743
I should ask you
the same question.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.746
Lois, you're in
an auto parts store, stealing mufflers.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.874
This is worse than
that Winona Ryder thing.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.876
Oh, are you sayin'
I am a klepto?

05:33.959 --> 05:35.919
Actually, I was talking about
The Age of Innocence.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.672
It is settled, May.
Our parents have consented

05:38.755 --> 05:40.132
and you and I
are to be married

05:40.215 --> 05:42.676
on the first warm,
sunny day of spring.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.722
That would be most good,
Newland, most good.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.433
(sighing)
I am sorry, but she is just awful.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.726
I-Is there any way...

05:50.809 --> 05:52.936
I mean, can we add,
like, a topless scene, or somethin'?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.021
DIRECTOR:
Uh, yeah.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.105
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.482
We can? Oh, great.
All right, we got a movie.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.485
Oh, God, you're right,
Brian, I'm out of control,

06:00.569 --> 06:02.279
But I don't know
what to do.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.948
I'm just hooked on
the rush of shoplifting.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.242
I haven't felt a thrill
like this in a long time.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.286
Well, I think
you've had enough thrills.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.371
Why don't you just
put everything back, huh?

06:11.455 --> 06:13.040
Uh, okay, Brian.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.125
You know,
you really are a good friend.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.460
Let me rub your belly.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.588
(moaning)

06:24.801 --> 06:25.802
Put it back.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.970
(continues moaning)

06:27.346 --> 06:28.514
(TV playing)

06:31.308 --> 06:33.727
Welcome back to
Channel 5 News at 10:00.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.895
For those of you
wondering

06:34.978 --> 06:36.939
what I've been writing down
as we go to commercial,

06:37.022 --> 06:39.650
it's a cat.
Just a cat.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.194
In other news,
police are still looking for the culprit

06:42.277 --> 06:43.904
who stole
a valuable Matisse painting

06:43.987 --> 06:45.989
from the Quahog
Museum of Art.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.492
A Matisse painting?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.244
Also,
scientists announced today

06:50.327 --> 06:51.912
that if your hand is
bigger than your face,

06:51.995 --> 06:53.747
you have cancer.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.957
Ha-ha!

06:55.040 --> 06:56.750
Got you. Aha! Ah!

06:56.834 --> 06:58.669
Oh, that's not even
really news.

07:00.838 --> 07:01.964
(vrooming)

07:02.047 --> 07:03.173
(sputtering)

07:03.257 --> 07:05.217
Oh, no, Rupert,
we're out of gas.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.635
We better ask
directions

07:06.718 --> 07:08.804
at that creepy,
and possibly haunted house.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.306
Ah! A ghost!

07:11.390 --> 07:13.100
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
it's okay. It's okay.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.185
We got away just in time.
We got away just in time.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.522
All right, now,
is that everything you stole?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.065
Uh, that's
everything.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.442
You know, you really should talk
to a therapist about this.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.111
I mean,
it really helped Peter out

07:24.194 --> 07:25.195
when he became
obsessed

07:25.279 --> 07:26.572
with that
fantasy world of his.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.870
Yeah!

07:32.953 --> 07:35.038
You're a little
too heavy, buddy.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.707
Yeah!

07:36.790 --> 07:38.250
We're going down.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.543
Yeah!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.422
Yeah.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.965
(sighing)
You know, Lois, we're just lucky

07:45.048 --> 07:47.259
we got this under control
before the police caught onto you.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.553
Hold it right there, Lois,
you are under arrest.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.431
Oh, crap. A-All right, look,
just--just take it easy, Joe.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.932
All right,
Lois will go peacefully.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.435
Oh, my God,
I am so embarrassed.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.270
Let me just
get my purse.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.023
(laughing)

08:01.106 --> 08:02.357
LOIS:
Sucker!

08:09.865 --> 08:11.950
(grunting)

08:15.579 --> 08:16.580
(gasps)

08:16.663 --> 08:17.873
(tires screeching)

08:17.956 --> 08:20.501
(Lois exclaiming)

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
(groaning)

08:22.920 --> 08:24.630
Sorry, Lois.
Regulations.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.006
I can't give you
any special treatment.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.091
It's okay, Joe,
I understand.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.343
Shut up, maggot!

08:29.426 --> 08:30.719
(groaning)

08:36.099 --> 08:39.478
Your Honor, I am so sorry
for stealing all that stuff.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.271
I just couldn't
control myself.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.356
Well, Mrs. Griffin,

08:42.439 --> 08:44.024
considering this is
your first offense,

08:44.107 --> 08:45.817
I've decided to
go lenient and...

08:45.901 --> 08:47.528
Where the hell is my gavel?

08:47.611 --> 08:49.363
(giggling)

08:49.446 --> 08:50.989
Give me that.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.325
I sentence you to two years
in the state prison.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.409
(gasps)

08:54.493 --> 08:55.536
Ah, man, that is bogus.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.828
Order in the court!

08:56.912 --> 08:58.121
Another outburst
like that, Mr. Griffin,

08:58.205 --> 08:59.206
and I'll extend
the sentence.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.290
(sneezes)

09:00.374 --> 09:01.375
Okay, three years.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.459
That was a sneeze.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.544
Four years.
I am sorry.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.878
Five years.
You douchebag.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.713
All right, three years it is.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.423
Three years in prison?

09:08.507 --> 09:10.717
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

09:10.801 --> 09:13.095
Oh, man,
I haven't been this upset

09:13.178 --> 09:15.597
since I watched
The Blob on television.

09:15.681 --> 09:18.267
Look out behind you, lady!
It's the blob!

09:18.350 --> 09:19.935
I'll save you.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.859
Here you go.
Meet your new friends.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.444
Uh, hi,
I'm Lois.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.614
I'm Fisty, that's Stabby,
and that's Balls.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.116
Pull up a chair,
we're playing cards.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.410
Oh. Okay.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.704
So, are those
biblical names?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.122
Yeah, Fisty is.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.834
Boy, I sure
miss Lois.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.961
I wish she was here
to clean up all this stuff.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.087
Hey, what's this?

09:47.171 --> 09:48.172
Mustard.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.257
Oh, that's right.
We had hot dogs last week.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.717
You gonna eat that?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.219
The mustard
on your shoulder? No.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.891
Oh, oh, kids, look!
Look. A deer.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.225
Can we
pet him?

10:00.309 --> 10:02.144
No, no. No, no, no.
No, just--just watch.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.270
(clatters)

10:05.355 --> 10:06.648
(all sighing)

10:06.732 --> 10:09.776
Peter! Peter!

10:09.860 --> 10:13.655
There's--there's
so much doody in here.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.867
I ca-- I can't take it
anymore.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.869
I haven't eaten in 4 days

10:18.952 --> 10:21.079
'Cause I--
'cause--'cause I...

10:21.163 --> 10:23.999
I just can't fit any more
in there.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.667
Help me.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.588
Okay, now when we get
to your mother's cage,

10:29.671 --> 10:31.256
say hello,
but don't drag your ass,

10:31.340 --> 10:32.716
'cause I want to go
the reptile house.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.218
Oh, and we got to
see those pandas.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.470
Peter, this isn't a zoo,
it's a prison.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.305
Quagmire,
what are you doin' here?

10:38.388 --> 10:39.681
Ah, it's conjugal visit day.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.350
You know, I love doing
a woman in the can.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.310
Oh! Giggity, giggity,
giggity, goo.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.521
Who else but Quagmire?

10:45.604 --> 10:48.148
He's Quagmire,
Quagmire

10:48.232 --> 10:50.484
You never really know
what he's gonna do next

10:50.567 --> 10:52.736
He's Quagmire,
Quagmire

10:52.819 --> 10:54.071
Giggity, giggity,
giggity, giggity

10:54.154 --> 10:55.155
Let's have sex

10:55.239 --> 10:57.074
I do hope
nothing happens

10:57.157 --> 10:59.576
to spoil this
fancy dinner party.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.786
(gasping)

11:00.869 --> 11:03.372
Giggity, giggity,
giggity, giggity. (gibbering)

11:03.455 --> 11:05.916
Who else but Quagmire?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.710
He's Quagmire,
Quagmire

11:08.794 --> 11:10.712
Giggity, giggity, goo!

11:10.796 --> 11:13.006
Oh, it is so good
to see all of you.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.341
How is everything
at home?

11:14.424 --> 11:16.218
Oh, it's horrible, Lois.
I've had to do

11:16.301 --> 11:17.761
all the things
that you usually do.

11:17.845 --> 11:18.846
Like the other night,

11:18.929 --> 11:20.347
I had to go to
your book club meeting.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.765
Well, I
really admired

11:21.849 --> 11:24.434
the mother character's
admission of personal torment

11:24.518 --> 11:25.894
after
her daughter's death.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.020
I--I disagree.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.231
I felt a total lack
of ethical integrity

11:29.314 --> 11:31.108
in her readiness to
abandon her children

11:31.191 --> 11:32.734
and start
a life of her own.

11:32.818 --> 11:36.405
Ah, here's another thing:
the book can also be...

11:36.488 --> 11:38.198
a hat.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.325
And the other night,
I had to do a...

11:40.409 --> 11:41.660
Well, you know,
that thing that you

11:41.743 --> 11:43.871
usually do for me
every Thursday night.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.497
(grunting)

11:46.999 --> 11:48.500
Ah!

11:52.754 --> 11:53.881
Ah, I can't believe
you're serving

11:53.964 --> 11:56.049
a three-year sentence,
it seems so harsh.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.385
Well, the only upside is
that it's given me time

11:58.468 --> 12:00.220
to think about
why I ended up in here.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.930
I--I guess
I was stealin'

12:02.014 --> 12:05.017
because I was so sick of
the same old routine.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.436
I felt like I had
a void in my life.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.438
Like--like there was
a secret hole in me.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.522
Oh, God!

12:10.606 --> 12:12.566
And I was trying to
fill that hole with

12:12.649 --> 12:15.569
all kinds of
expensive objects and things.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.070
Oh, God!

12:17.154 --> 12:18.405
And I felt
wonderful

12:18.488 --> 12:20.741
with all those things
filling that hole.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.451
Oh, God!

12:22.534 --> 12:23.869
I did this to myself

12:23.952 --> 12:25.662
so I'm just gonna
have to lay back

12:25.746 --> 12:28.040
and let the penal system
teach me a lesson.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.958
That one
is also sexual.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.293
Well, I guess
with good behavior,

12:31.376 --> 12:32.711
you could be out in two years.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.963
I made my own bed
with this one, guys.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.716
I'm just gonna have to
pay my debt to society.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.092
Not necessarily.

12:39.176 --> 12:42.346
I think I got an idea
of how to smuggle you out.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.265
Bye-bye, take care, now.
Have a nice day.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.391
(mumbling)

12:49.102 --> 12:50.312
(alarm wailing)

12:51.480 --> 12:52.523
(chattering)

12:54.525 --> 12:55.859
What do we do?

12:57.903 --> 12:59.655
Hurry!
We'll hide in that van.

13:07.579 --> 13:10.082
My God, you know
what this means?

13:10.165 --> 13:12.209
You're all accessories
to my escape.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.253
She's right.
We're fugitives from the law.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.379
What the hell is
wrong with you?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.547
I'm a dog, all right.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.883
I have a very tough time
standing up in the car.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.343
Well, then
we're fugitives.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.011
But at least
the family's back together.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.096
I wonder
where we're going.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.180
Calm down!

13:25.264 --> 13:26.640
I'll tell you what
were going to do.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.225
Wherever this van stops,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.018
we'll begin
a new life together.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.855
We'll blend in to the fabric
of that community.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.777
Peter, we're
in Asiantown.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.988
Well, at least
I don't have to worry

13:41.071 --> 13:42.823
about the evil monkey here.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.200
(screams)

13:50.289 --> 13:52.040
Well, if we're gonna hide
out here in Asiantown,

13:52.124 --> 13:53.500
we have to find
a place to live.

13:53.584 --> 13:54.877
Yes, and we should do
nothing

13:54.960 --> 13:57.588
to draw attention to
ourselves as outsiders.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.174
Oh, my God!
It's Jackie Chan.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.134
Oh, my God!
It's Jackie Chan.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.094
Oh, my God!
It's Jackie Chan.

14:04.178 --> 14:05.179
Hi there!

14:05.262 --> 14:06.722
Always nice to meet
a fan of my movies.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.140
Oh, my God,
you're Ethan Hawke!

14:08.223 --> 14:09.308
Uh, no, I'm not.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.392
Sorry, my mistake.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.144
Oh, my God,
it's Ethan Hawke!

14:12.227 --> 14:13.604
Mom, can we
go get some food?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.522
Oh, my God,
there's Malcolm in Middle!

14:15.606 --> 14:16.607
I'm not a boy.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.774
Yes, you are.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.114
I can't believe
we have to live here.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.574
No, this sucks!

14:25.657 --> 14:27.534
Ugh, tell me about it.
I haven't seen

14:27.618 --> 14:29.328
one female baby
since we got here.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.954
This place is
a sausage-fest.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.831
Come on, kids,
we've been through worse.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.499
Meg, you--you remember
when you found out

14:34.583 --> 14:36.793
your gynecologist
never finished med school?

14:36.877 --> 14:37.920
All right, Meg,

14:38.003 --> 14:39.838
let's take a look
at that bergina.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.841
But Peter, how are we
going to support ourselves here?

14:42.925 --> 14:44.927
Well, we'll all have
to get jobs, but I'm sure

14:45.010 --> 14:46.720
we'll each find
something we can do.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.056
Where are you from?

14:49.139 --> 14:50.140
Tokyo.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.726
Oh, Tokyo!
Yeah, it's a great town.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.977
Lot of people, though.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.062
Yup.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.147
You-you're here on business?
I bet its business

14:57.231 --> 15:00.192
'cause I had a fare
earlier today that...

15:00.275 --> 15:02.027
This used to be
a people business,

15:02.110 --> 15:04.112
but now, I don't know.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.325
Oh, damn! I say,
I seem to have sewn

15:08.408 --> 15:10.786
a shoe to my hand,
may I go to the nurse?

15:10.869 --> 15:12.496
Replace him!

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
(screams)

15:14.748 --> 15:15.749
(screams)

15:15.832 --> 15:16.834
(baby crying)

15:18.377 --> 15:19.378
Faster!

15:19.461 --> 15:22.005
So, what exactly
would you say

15:22.089 --> 15:24.466
qualifies you
to work as a sumo wrestler?

15:24.550 --> 15:25.551
Oh, are you kiddin'?

15:25.634 --> 15:27.886
I'm a born athlete,
just like Greg Louganis.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.471
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.056
You're probably
asking yourself,

15:31.139 --> 15:32.724
"Which way
are they gonna go?

15:32.808 --> 15:33.809
"Are they gonna make

15:33.892 --> 15:35.269
"a diving-board
head-injury joke?

15:35.352 --> 15:37.145
"Are they gonna
make an AIDS joke?

15:37.229 --> 15:39.314
"Or are they gonna make
a joke about the fact

15:39.398 --> 15:40.399
"that his last name

15:40.482 --> 15:42.025
sounds suspiciously
like 'anus'?"

15:42.109 --> 15:43.986
Well, we're gonna
take the high road

15:44.069 --> 15:45.696
and do a no-body-hair joke.

15:45.779 --> 15:46.780
Brian?

15:46.864 --> 15:49.199
Hi, I'm Greg Louganis.
I'm totally shaven.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.827
Terrific! Terrific.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.040
Damn it, Swanson.
I want them found.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.377
Mayor West, we have every available man
looking for the Griffins.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.087
We just don't have
any leads.

16:02.171 --> 16:03.589
Not the Griffins,
you moron!

16:03.672 --> 16:06.008
The rest of
my Lite Brite pieces!

16:06.091 --> 16:07.926
My name
isn't "Adam We"!

16:08.594 --> 16:10.888
Or is it?
Who am I?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.222
What number
did you dial?

16:12.306 --> 16:14.057
Don't ever
call here again.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.976
I guess I told him!

16:16.059 --> 16:19.146
Nobody messes
with Adam We.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.898
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

16:20.981 --> 16:24.234
Sumo Tonight,
brought to you by Asian Trix.

16:24.318 --> 16:26.862
Silly rabbit!
Trix are for kids!

16:26.945 --> 16:28.071
You share!

16:28.155 --> 16:29.615
(groans)

16:31.366 --> 16:35.120
Uh, I'm not really sure
what to do here.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.706
Boy! You've put on weight,
Jackie Chan.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.082
(all cheering)

16:39.166 --> 16:40.417
Oh, my God!

16:40.501 --> 16:41.877
BONNIE:
Did you walk?

16:47.591 --> 16:49.510
(dance music playing)

16:51.720 --> 16:54.014
(exclaiming)

16:54.097 --> 16:58.393
MALE ANNOUNCER:
You're watching CBS Asiantown.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.020
Hey, everybody,
I'm home.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.271
Oh, you're
just in time.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.023
I ordered Caucasian
for dinner.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.274
Chris,
I'm hungry.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.901
It's your turn to
keep watch for the cops.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.403
Wait a minute, am--am I the only one who
thinks this is nuts?

17:08.487 --> 17:09.988
We've given up
our whole lives.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.073
Come on, Brian,

17:11.156 --> 17:12.616
a change of scenery
is always good.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.744
Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed
my trip to Nebraska.

17:20.749 --> 17:24.336
So, um, anybody see
any good movies lately?

17:24.419 --> 17:25.921
-No, not really. No.
-Uh-uh.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.422
Oh.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.007
Read any
good books?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.300
-No.
-Uh-uh, no.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.010
Oh.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.178
Anything new
with corn?

17:33.262 --> 17:34.263
Oh, yeah, corn...

17:34.346 --> 17:35.514
Corn--
You betcha!

17:35.597 --> 17:36.598
Corn, absolutely.

17:36.682 --> 17:37.683
Corn, yeah.

17:37.766 --> 17:38.934
Corn is always
interesting.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.104
Hey, Mom, Mr. Swanson's here
to visit us.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.772
What?

17:43.856 --> 17:46.149
(inaudible)

17:46.233 --> 17:48.235
Oh, my God,
we got to get out of here!

17:52.865 --> 17:55.158
Taxi! Follow that family.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.546
Come on, everybody,
over the fence.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.756
Ah, yes, a fence.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.842
The cripple's natural enemy.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.181
(sighs)

18:17.264 --> 18:18.265
I think
we lost him.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.435
There they are.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.853
Quick! Into the sewer.

18:23.812 --> 18:24.938
(grunting)

18:27.816 --> 18:30.068
Ugh, good lord!
It's disgusting down here.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.362
Oh, boy, Stewie's got
the right idea.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.281
Ow, what the hell
are you doing?

18:34.364 --> 18:35.824
It's wet down there, Brian.

18:35.908 --> 18:37.242
Gee, this sucks
worse than that time

18:37.326 --> 18:39.536
I did cocaine
with Karl Malden.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.538
What are you getting
all bent out of shape about?

18:41.622 --> 18:43.332
Well, you know,
Karl, I--I didn't get...

18:43.415 --> 18:44.833
I got virtually
nothin' here, you know?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.251
Look, I don't see
what the problem is.

18:46.335 --> 18:47.461
No, you wouldn't,
would you?

18:47.544 --> 18:49.755
L-look, all I'm saying is,
I got the raw end of the deal.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.964
You invited me over.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.549
Yeah, well,
now I'm regretting it.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.305
When I fire rockets,

18:58.388 --> 18:59.890
I always pretend
I shooting

18:59.973 --> 19:01.892
at Alan Alda
and Jamie Farr.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.728
Take that, wisecracking
meatball surgeon!

19:17.950 --> 19:18.951
(rats squeaking)

19:19.034 --> 19:20.577
Which way
should we go?

19:20.661 --> 19:22.120
I don't know,
let's ask the Goonies.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.455
Take the left one.

19:23.539 --> 19:25.874
Thanks. Hey, hey,
Chunk, Chunk, come here, come here.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.752
Hey, uh, before you go,
do the truffle shuffle.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.546
Oh, come on!

19:30.629 --> 19:32.297
Do the truffle shuffle.

19:32.381 --> 19:33.549
(sighs)

19:35.342 --> 19:36.552
(laughing)

19:37.886 --> 19:39.638
Childhood obesity.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.642
Lois, come on,
what are you doing?

19:43.725 --> 19:44.726
(sighs)

19:44.810 --> 19:46.520
I can't do it, Peter.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.604
What are you
talkin' about?

19:47.688 --> 19:48.689
Look at us.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.190
We're runnin'
through a sewer,

19:50.274 --> 19:51.483
and it's because of me.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.151
Look, honey,
it was very sweet of you

19:53.235 --> 19:54.319
to break me out of jail

19:54.403 --> 19:55.863
but I did
somethin' wrong.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.906
And I'm the one
who should pay,

19:57.990 --> 19:59.825
not my whole family.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.076
(sighs)

20:01.159 --> 20:02.536
I'm gonna
turn myself in.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.787
(helicopter whirring)

20:05.122 --> 20:06.999
You're mine now, Lois!

20:07.749 --> 20:09.126
(Joe screaming)

20:11.378 --> 20:12.921
Oh, my God, Joe!

20:13.922 --> 20:17.092
Joe, you're too heavy.
I can't hang on.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.303
Pretend
I'm your child, Lois.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.971
Not Meg! Not Meg!

20:23.682 --> 20:26.393
Lois, you saved my life.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.812
I say, Corey Haim!

20:28.896 --> 20:30.147
Are you with
the Goonies as well?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.899
No, I just
live down here.

20:31.982 --> 20:32.983
Mine!

20:36.612 --> 20:37.905
Ah, it was
so nice of Joe

20:37.988 --> 20:39.573
to work things out
with that judge.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.158
Yeah, but I'm sure
gonna miss my buddies

20:41.241 --> 20:42.326
down at the sumo ring.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.162
Dad, can you teach me
how to sumo wrestle?

20:45.245 --> 20:46.288
Oh, it's not
too hard, Chris.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.623
Hey, Brian,
help me demonstrate.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.374
Uh, Peter,
maybe somebody else could--

20:49.458 --> 20:50.459
Come on!

20:50.542 --> 20:51.543
(sighs)

20:51.627 --> 20:53.212
Okay, so on the count of three,

20:53.295 --> 20:54.505
you try to push me
out of the ring,

20:54.588 --> 20:55.714
I try to push you
out of the ring.

20:55.797 --> 20:56.798
Okay? Ready?

20:56.882 --> 20:58.383
One, two, three!

20:58.467 --> 20:59.968
(groaning)

21:00.052 --> 21:02.137
Ow. What--What the hell?
What the hell?

21:02.221 --> 21:04.056
Brian, I'm sorry--

21:04.139 --> 21:05.182
No! No, no.
You know what?

21:05.265 --> 21:07.267
It's not cool, Peter.
It's not cool.

21:10.771 --> 21:13.982
(Asian version of
theme music playing)
