00:01.335 --> 00:04.072
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.105 --> 00:07.075
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.676
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:08.709 --> 00:11.712
but at a terrible cost.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.448
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.482 --> 00:17.151
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:17.185 --> 00:18.619
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.754
And then,
lab-made creatures called "hybrids"

00:20.788 --> 00:22.123
devastated the West Coast.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.258
(roaring)

00:24.292 --> 00:26.160
So a massive barrier
was constructed

00:26.194 --> 00:29.497
to protect the rest
of North America.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.165
But new breeds have
started to appear.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.100
(screeches)

00:32.133 --> 00:34.168
So we reassembled our team.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.803
We battle on many fronts,

00:35.836 --> 00:37.238
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:37.271 --> 00:40.474
while racing to
stop the hybrids...

00:40.508 --> 00:42.510
and the rogue Shepherd
who created them

00:42.543 --> 00:43.511
to end the human race.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.813
(growling)

00:45.846 --> 00:49.150
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.353
(screaming)

00:52.386 --> 00:54.855
Previously on Zoo...

00:54.888 --> 00:57.625
You have the bio-drive switch.
Why don't you just use it?

00:57.658 --> 01:00.128
Because I don't need
Mitch right now.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.130
I need Mr. Duncan.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.765
You're gonna do something
that Mitch would never do.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.268
ABRAHAM: Somehow,
the spinal fluid survived.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.303
We can still make the cure.
You're leaving?

01:09.337 --> 01:11.705
DARIELA: Today,
I thought I was gonna watch my son die.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.507
Let's go home.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.110
I can't.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.221
ABIGAIL: I activate the beacons,

01:17.245 --> 01:19.747
and the hybrids rise.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.848
You're a hybrid?

01:20.881 --> 01:23.117
My hybrids are gonna
take over the world.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.585
(grunts) What happened?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.587
Beacons.
Abigail's gonna activate them.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.722
Oh, my God.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.271
LOGAN: Our scientists think that
the eggs are closer to hatching.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.406
No telling what will
happen when they do.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.544
We know from the deaths
in Germany that the eggs

01:50.578 --> 01:53.247
release toxic spores
when they're disturbed.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.650
In an enclosed area like this,
they'll be particularly lethal.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.320
But these chem-packs
will suppress them.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.469
That should
neutralize the spores.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.339
But keep a close eye on your
toxin meters just to be safe.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.473
(liquid dripping)

02:19.507 --> 02:21.309
Green is good, yellow is bad.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.545
Red, you're probably dead. Okay.

02:24.578 --> 02:28.282
Lay the charges at the exact
locations marked on your GPS.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.383
We have 30 minutes.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.829
JACKSON: We got to
get her into the lab.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.764
(Jackson and Max grunting)

02:43.797 --> 02:45.333
MAX: Remind me again
how many people

02:45.366 --> 02:46.410
this Abigail woman has killed?

02:46.434 --> 02:47.768
Not now, Max.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.370
(alarm beeping)

02:49.403 --> 02:51.205
SAM: Hurry,
her heart rate's dropping.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.673
It's not hers, it's the baby's.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.342
Is my son dying?
I'm working on it, Sam.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.344
Hang on! You said the
transfusion of my blood

02:56.377 --> 02:57.554
would save the baby.
It should have.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.622
"Should have"? Do you even know

02:58.646 --> 02:59.680
what you're doing?

02:59.713 --> 03:00.914
What is that?

03:00.948 --> 03:03.217
I synthesized the
hybrid growth factors.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.628
Like I said,
the only way to save your son

03:04.652 --> 03:06.496
is to accelerate the
pregnancy and induce labor.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.188
I'm sorry,
but it's the only way.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.691
(gun cocks)

03:12.260 --> 03:13.927
Get back.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.529
(alarm continues blaring)

03:17.631 --> 03:19.600
Get her out of that tank, now.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.435
We got to turn this
place into a triage unit

03:21.469 --> 03:23.504
if we want to save her life.
Okay.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.661
Listen, I'm gonna go get
Abe, okay?

03:37.685 --> 03:39.320
All right, all right. Go.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.488
(sighs)

03:40.521 --> 03:41.489
(alarm continues blaring)

03:41.522 --> 03:42.956
Sam, I have to inject

03:42.990 --> 03:44.992
this serum into that tank now!

03:45.025 --> 03:47.003
What if it kills her, huh?
It won't, you have to trust me.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.362
I don't trust you!

03:48.396 --> 03:50.398
The girl I love is
floating in a tank

03:50.431 --> 03:51.975
like a freak experiment;
you put her in there.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.334
Your son is going to die!

03:53.367 --> 03:54.902
JACKSON: Sam!

04:00.308 --> 04:01.442
What's happening here?

04:13.487 --> 04:15.456
(alarm stops)

04:15.489 --> 04:17.958
Everything is fine now.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.392
What the hell's he doing here?

04:19.427 --> 04:20.361
He was working with Abigail.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.464
We found him tied up
at Abigail's facility,

04:23.497 --> 04:25.466
pretending to be a prisoner.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.435
I'll get him to the cage.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.912
We can question him
later when Clem's stable.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.438
I need your help upstairs.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.439
(gun clicks)

04:31.472 --> 04:32.640
JAMIE: Like I said before,

04:32.673 --> 04:33.941
you're going to do something

04:33.974 --> 04:36.777
that Mitch would never do.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.780
You're going to kill Abigail.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.783
Let's entertain
that for a moment.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.486
How do you see it playing out?

04:45.519 --> 04:47.521
You're a doctor.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.798
They're gonna want
you to save her,

04:48.822 --> 04:50.758
but you're going to kill her.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.362
I extracted her spinal
fluid and she collapsed.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.597
What?
And you did that because...?

04:56.630 --> 04:59.967
Because Abigail is the final
hybrid we've been looking for.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.435
That changes things.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.070
So we're saving her life now.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.472
Why?

05:04.505 --> 05:05.506
MITCH: My programming...

05:05.539 --> 05:08.509
My biological imperative...

05:08.542 --> 05:11.011
Is that I serve one person.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.613
You're asking me to
kill that person.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.382
Why would I do that?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.384
If you don't,
I'll put you back in your box.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.785
(device clicks)

05:22.089 --> 05:23.491
Mitch?

05:27.094 --> 05:29.797
Hey.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.465
Are we alive?

05:31.499 --> 05:33.701
'Cause the-the plane
was going down and...

05:33.734 --> 05:35.636
You're okay. It's okay.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.575
Mitch,
you're gonna have to trust me.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.543
Whoa, whoa.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.611
Jamie, what are you...?

05:44.745 --> 05:48.449
(device clicks, whirrs)

05:48.482 --> 05:50.584
I don't understand
how all of this works,

05:50.618 --> 05:52.986
but if Mitch is
here, you aren't.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.588
I can erase you.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.156
What I'm offering you

05:56.189 --> 05:58.492
is the chance to be
free from Abigail,

05:58.526 --> 06:01.094
from me, from anyone.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.006
When Abigail held me
captive, she said something

06:03.030 --> 06:04.565
about "the hybrids will rise."

06:04.598 --> 06:06.042
Now, she failed to
set off her beacons,

06:06.066 --> 06:08.068
but there's more to her
plan, Abe, I know it.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.813
And now, you want to
revive her in the hopes

06:09.837 --> 06:11.705
that she's going to tell you.
Yes.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.541
She's a terrorist.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.543
She's killed hundreds
of innocent people.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.478
Barely got a pulse here, guys.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.447
I need you.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.548
I need your help.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.751
I was a soldier
before I was a doctor.

06:23.784 --> 06:28.155
I've seen close-up what
people like Abigail can do.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.725
Maybe the world is
better off without her.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.563
JAMIE: This safe has
an eight-digit code.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.534
I'll enter the first four
numbers, easy as pie.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.569
(safe beeps)

06:42.970 --> 06:45.038
And you can enter the next.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.577
Do exactly as I say,

06:49.610 --> 06:51.712
and the device is yours.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.716
Why don't you and your friends

06:55.749 --> 06:57.851
just kill Abigail yourselves?

06:57.885 --> 07:00.220
Because that's not
how this story goes.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.789
It's happened before.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.624
We fight,
we put our lives on the line.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.625
(safe beeps)

07:04.658 --> 07:07.561
And then, we show mercy.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.630
And it bites us in the
ass every single time.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.498
JACKSON: I know what she is,

07:10.531 --> 07:12.533
I know what she's
done, I don't care.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.635
We are saving her
life, end of story.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.470
JAMIE: Now,
Jackson's a great guy.

07:16.504 --> 07:20.207
He has a huge heart,
but it is putting us all at risk.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.644
I have to break the cycle.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.846
(liquid squishing)

07:30.183 --> 07:32.886
(squishing, squealing)

07:32.920 --> 07:35.823
MacDonald? How's it looking?

07:35.856 --> 07:37.825
MacDONALD (over radio):
Charges are set.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.026
Okay. Fallon?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.561
What's your 20?

07:40.594 --> 07:42.195
FALLON: It's almost done.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.664
(Fallon coughing)

07:43.697 --> 07:45.533
LOGAN: Fallon, is that you?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.501
(Fallon retching) Who
has eyes on Fallon?

07:47.535 --> 07:49.537
(coughing continues)

07:54.708 --> 07:55.876
The spores are releasing.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.211
Everybody evac to the
tunnel, now.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.554
LOGAN: Go, move, move!

08:06.587 --> 08:08.622
Fallon, come on!

08:08.656 --> 08:09.823
(coughing)

08:13.026 --> 08:14.628
Come on, let's go.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.568
(gagging) Hey! Fallon.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.804
(liquid bursts)

08:31.679 --> 08:33.681
♪

08:43.924 --> 08:46.927
(siren wailing)

08:51.298 --> 08:53.300
(knocking on door)

08:55.669 --> 08:56.670
Can I help you?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.672
Can I interest you
in a bear claw?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.614
DARIELA: No more than two.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.917
Thanks for the offer,
and the donuts,

09:09.950 --> 09:11.752
but I can't join the IADG.

09:11.785 --> 09:15.055
If you're concerned for your
son, we can ensure his safety.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.625
Why do you need me?

09:17.658 --> 09:20.027
Your missions with
Jackson Oz and his team.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.196
You've been on the frontlines
of the hybrid problem.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.865
And you are one
of the best minds

09:24.898 --> 09:27.034
when it comes to
ground force tactical.

09:27.067 --> 09:31.138
That's why we need you.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.347
There are hundreds of thousands
of children just like Isaac

09:40.380 --> 09:42.616
who won't have a
world to call home,

09:42.650 --> 09:46.754
unless we take a
stand, together.

09:53.393 --> 09:54.762
ABRAHAM: So,

09:54.795 --> 09:56.797
are you going to accept?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.231
DARIELA: I don't know.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.268
The only person who could
take care of him is...

10:01.301 --> 10:02.670
Isabelle.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.805
ABRAHAM: Isabelle
is like family.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.807
He'll be fine.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.645
But I feel like a hypocrite.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.747
After I deserted
you and the team.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.749
Dariela, listen to me.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.785
The world is ending.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.688
The stakes are too high for
someone of your skill set

10:20.721 --> 10:22.122
to sit on the sidelines.

10:22.155 --> 10:26.794
You've been the wife,
you've been the mother.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.764
It's time for you to
become a soldier again.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.780
(sniffs, sighs)

10:49.316 --> 10:51.719
(panting)

11:07.367 --> 11:08.869
(yells)

11:08.902 --> 11:09.870
What are you going to do?

11:09.903 --> 11:11.772
What you asked me to do.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.206
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

11:17.477 --> 11:19.880
I know how to prep for surgery.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.049
It's okay, I got it.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.718
I know a thing or
two about anatomy.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.754
Remember the last time
we did surgery together?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.190
Yes.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.458
Good times.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.227
What are you talking about?

11:34.261 --> 11:35.929
That elephant almost died.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.430
We were in surgery for 17 hours.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.135
Right. I know.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.905
I was making a joke.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.741
Do me a favor, Jamie.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.077
Get some alcohol over
there, please.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.447
(monitor beeping rapidly)

11:54.481 --> 11:55.916
MAX: Whoa. Whoa.

11:55.949 --> 11:56.950
MITCH: What's happening?

11:56.984 --> 11:58.251
I'm not sure.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.756
Could be a tympanic rupture.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.833
Maybe pressure to her brain.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.194
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.830
Her spine is leaking.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.874
She needs a lumbar puncture.

12:10.898 --> 12:11.865
Shouldn't we open her up?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.834
MITCH: No time.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.402
Hold her down. (clears throat)

12:19.840 --> 12:21.308
(rapid beeping continues)

12:21.341 --> 12:22.910
(fluid squishing)

12:25.445 --> 12:27.915
(monitor beeping steadily)

12:33.420 --> 12:36.056
Okay. Nice job, son.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.026
(sighs) I'll get the MRI scan

12:39.059 --> 12:41.929
so we can find that CSF leak.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.032
What the hell was that?

12:45.065 --> 12:48.168
I only alleviated the pressure.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.337
It'll probably still kill her.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.972
Yeah, but it might not.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.340
Why didn't you just let her die?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.208
There are two other
doctors on this plane.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.877
Wasn't part of your
plan to make this

12:56.910 --> 12:58.378
not look like blatant murder?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.982
Don't worry, I'm fairly certain

13:02.015 --> 13:03.450
she'll be dead within the hour.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.823
JACKSON: Sam,

13:09.857 --> 13:12.525
I know you're
working with Abigail.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.028
I need you to tell me
what she was planning.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.463
She was planning to stop you.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.132
Stop me from what?

13:19.166 --> 13:20.868
Activating beacons.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.072
Waking hybrid nests
you've planted.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.475
Wow.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.177
She's really done
a number on you.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.312
Sam,

13:32.345 --> 13:35.883
you have this entire
thing backwards.

13:35.916 --> 13:41.054
I was there when you let the
razorbacks loose on Pangaea.

13:41.088 --> 13:44.892
My father was dead before
I could get to him.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.327
My mother died in my arms.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.562
I was ten-years-old.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.198
Abigail helped
raise me after that.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.465
I've known her my entire life.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.934
I trust her.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.537
I don't know you.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.407
There's only one person on
this plane I'll listen to.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.209
And she's floating in a tank.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.476
(bars rattle)

14:09.917 --> 14:11.551
GARRISON: Is your son okay?

14:11.584 --> 14:12.953
DARIELA: He's good.

14:12.986 --> 14:13.887
I explained everything to him.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.156
He's actually excited
his mom got recruited

14:16.189 --> 14:18.258
to help save the world.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.894
I tucked him into bed,
got to say good-bye. Good.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.163
We've posted guards at the
house, 24/7.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.898
Thank you.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.935
GARRISON: As you know,
there's been isolated packs

14:27.968 --> 14:31.004
of razorbacks east of the
wall these last few years.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.240
We've managed to
exterminate them.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.475
Now the only hybrids
left in North America

14:35.508 --> 14:37.610
are west of the barrier.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.012
And? We found nests

14:39.046 --> 14:42.049
here and in other
parts of the world.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.918
Presumably planted
by Abigail Westbrook

14:44.952 --> 14:46.319
over the last decade.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.420
Squashed one

14:47.454 --> 14:48.621
in Columbus,

14:48.655 --> 14:49.990
targeting one in Atlanta,

14:50.023 --> 14:52.926
and your old friend Logan

14:52.960 --> 14:55.362
is dealing with one in
Seoul, Korea.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.431
Our science division
thinks that these nests

14:58.465 --> 15:00.533
are gonna hatch on their own,

15:00.567 --> 15:03.036
even if the beacons
never go off.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.672
If the beacons go off,
that'll make it ten times worse.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.508
The hybrids are just wild
animals, but those beacons

15:08.541 --> 15:09.943
allow Abigail to weaponize them,

15:09.977 --> 15:11.720
to draw them on a death
march in any direction

15:11.744 --> 15:13.113
she wants them to go.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.381
That kind of insight

15:14.414 --> 15:17.684
can help you run ground
force operations.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.619
You report directly to me.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.088
Whatever you need, sir.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.023
Welcome to the IADG.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.560
This is all the data we got from
the tank that healed Abigail.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.096
Now,
I can't make any sense of it,

15:29.129 --> 15:32.132
but I know that you can, Abe.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.101
Please.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.069
I need your help.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.007
I am asking you, please.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.109
Whatever information

15:42.142 --> 15:45.078
you hope to get from Abigail
had better be worth it.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.048
Let's sift through this.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.650
Search for anything
concerning internal organs.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.252
Considering she's a hybrid,

15:52.285 --> 15:54.587
there may be differences
we need to know about.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.124
I got her MRI results.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.391
We found the leak.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.093
Right there on the left.
(computer beeps)

16:00.127 --> 16:01.328
Dariela.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.997
Abe, the IADG just
found hybrid nests

16:04.031 --> 16:05.999
hidden all over the world,
and they're incubating.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.176
JACKSON: How much
time until they hatch?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.244
The scientists here think soon.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.536
Logan's in Seoul now

16:09.569 --> 16:11.238
dealing with one.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.406
Every species of hybrid
are in these nests.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.018
If they hatch,
we're talking thousands of new ones

16:15.042 --> 16:16.576
we have to fight.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.212
Get these results to Mitch.
Excuse me a second.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.101
(quietly): Oh...

16:48.475 --> 16:51.744
I was reluctant to
save Abigail before.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.781
But now I know what it
will take to save her.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.116
The cost is too high.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.650
What cost?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.588
What we took, we must replace.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.090
What? You mean put the
spinal fluid sample back?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.193
No, no, no, not quite.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.828
She had internal injuries.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.598
And she lost more spinal
fluid than you extracted.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.200
And because she shares DNA

17:13.233 --> 17:14.601
with all the hybrids,

17:14.634 --> 17:16.103
we need to synthesize
a replacement

17:16.136 --> 17:18.204
with all the
samples we obtained.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.107
The samples we need
to make the cure?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.473
Yes.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.710
Either we use them
to save your sister,

17:23.742 --> 17:25.145
or save mankind.

17:30.583 --> 17:34.221
Dariela said the nests contain
every type of hybrid, correct?

17:34.254 --> 17:35.822
What are you thinking?

17:35.855 --> 17:38.191
(tablet beeping)

17:38.225 --> 17:40.693
Use the spinal fluid
to save Abigail.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.230
I'll get more.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.531
We're going to Seoul.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.244
What's that?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.679
Epinephrine.

17:59.712 --> 18:03.216
An untraceable heart stimulant.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.486
By the time surgery starts,
she'll be in cardiac arrest.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.799
ABRAHAM: Mitch,
I'm scrubbing in.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.292
I don't need help. Plans change.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.827
We're using the spinal
fluid synthesis to save her.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.663
Jackson will get more.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.131
Are you kidding me?

18:18.165 --> 18:20.267
Is that why the plane
is accelerating?

18:20.300 --> 18:23.470
Instead of curing sterility,
Jackson wants to save Abigail?

18:23.503 --> 18:26.173
There are hybrid nests
and they are incubating.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.816
And the only person that
knows how to stop them

18:27.840 --> 18:29.276
is dying here on this table.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.211
We need to do this.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.416
(phone ringing)

18:36.449 --> 18:38.285
Dariela.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.752
Detective Hale. Or should I say,

18:39.786 --> 18:40.853
Special Agent Hale?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.298
I'm glad to see
Garrison took my advice

18:42.322 --> 18:43.323
and brought you onboard.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.325
We've been told to hold
off laying explosives

18:45.358 --> 18:46.626
until after we hear from HQ.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.328
What about an air strike?

18:48.361 --> 18:49.329
Can't. With an air
strike, there's no way

18:49.362 --> 18:51.298
to contain the spores. Right.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.276
And we know that the chem-pack's
effectiveness is limited.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.934
The window seems
to be 20 minutes.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.379
Garrison doesn't want
anyone in that nest

18:56.403 --> 18:57.680
until they can write
up a full report.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.671
So in the meantime,

18:58.705 --> 19:00.340
we just wait.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.874
Officially,

19:01.908 --> 19:04.311
you are to stand by and
await further orders.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.280
And unofficially?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.249
That's where I come in.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.218
I'll let Jackson explain.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.886
Retractors are in.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.626
Mitch, wait. Stop.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.928
Severing that artery
will kill her.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.363
What are you doing, Mitch?

19:23.396 --> 19:25.232
What did you think
you were cutting?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.700
I wasn't cutting.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.269
I was moving the disc

19:29.302 --> 19:30.870
in order to prevent
trapping a nerve.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.239
Please,

19:32.272 --> 19:34.774
be more careful.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.344
(sighs)

19:37.377 --> 19:39.679
Making the last injection.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.519
Okay.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.963
I think it's working.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.931
Her vitals are up.

19:58.965 --> 20:02.269
She's going to make it.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.379
LOGAN: So you're
doing all of this

20:03.403 --> 20:05.281
to save Abigail?
You realize that she's a terrorist...

20:05.305 --> 20:07.307
Terrorist responsible
for hundreds of deaths

20:07.340 --> 20:09.017
and for releasing hybrids
all over the world?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.478
Believe me, this case has been made.
(latch opens)

20:11.511 --> 20:13.313
But her plan isn't finished.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.747
There's more she can tell us.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.259
Oh, so you're sure the
fact that she's your sister

20:16.283 --> 20:17.450
has nothing to do with it?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.422
I need the schematics of where
you need the explosives laid.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.392
Jackson, you're gonna have
a 20-minute window in there.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.503
There's no way that you're
gonna be able to sift through

20:27.527 --> 20:30.363
thousands of eggs to find the
six that you actually need.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.998
It's impossible.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.001
I know.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.869
But I got to try.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.408
Then I'm coming with you.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.512
What can I say?

20:45.545 --> 20:48.247
I've always been a sucker
for an impossible challenge.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.851
(air hisses)

20:51.884 --> 20:53.586
Famous last words.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.330
(eggs squishing)

21:08.768 --> 21:11.438
(hybrids chittering in eggs)

21:22.715 --> 21:24.584
You boys have
exactly 20 minutes.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.828
That chem-pack won't
suppress the spores

21:25.852 --> 21:28.655
for any longer than that.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.724
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:39.532 --> 21:42.469
Abigail is stable.
Abe is going to save her.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.805
Did you hear me?

21:45.838 --> 21:49.742
Have you ever worked against
your friends like this?

21:49.776 --> 21:53.746
I am making a tough call
for the greater good.

21:53.780 --> 21:57.650
I am almost completely
task-oriented.

21:59.652 --> 22:03.490
Morality is not an issue.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.858
Your good side battles your
bad, which forces you

22:05.892 --> 22:08.795
into making bad decisions
that you have to live with.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.564
I don't need a psych
eval from a robot.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.835
You've won.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.904
Abigail's already dead.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.105
What do you mean?

22:19.138 --> 22:20.540
He just injected her

22:20.573 --> 22:23.943
with what he thought
was meperidine.

22:23.976 --> 22:27.880
But it was actually a
lethal dose of epinephrine.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.418
Abe's gonna think he killed her.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.854
Is that a problem?

22:34.887 --> 22:38.525
(monitor beeping rapidly)

22:38.558 --> 22:39.892
Mitch?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.127
I need you down here.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.797
If that's what it takes.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.366
ABRAHAM: Mitch, she's crashing!

22:53.005 --> 22:55.050
LOGAN: That chem-pack should
make it safe for you to handle

22:55.074 --> 22:57.109
the hybrid eggs and
extract the spinal fluid

22:57.143 --> 22:59.145
without setting off the spores.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.550
Emphasis on "should."

23:03.583 --> 23:05.985
Only one way to find out.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.893
(fluid squishing)

23:19.999 --> 23:23.470
(fluid squishing)

23:31.878 --> 23:32.945
DARIELA: One down,

23:32.979 --> 23:33.913
16 minutes left.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.223
Come on, guys, pick up the pace.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.616
We need to split up.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.152
All right.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.529
(monitor beeping rapidly)
Abe, what did you do?

23:44.557 --> 23:47.226
I injected her with meperidine.
Her heart stopped.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.029
We have to perform CPR.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.964
(monitor continues beeping)

23:53.966 --> 23:55.768
Get the respirator bag.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.704
Okay.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.539
I'm going to start compressions.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.040
Okay. (Grunts)

24:01.073 --> 24:04.043
(grunting rhythmically)

24:05.978 --> 24:08.515
Go, go, go.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.750
Come on, come on. (grunts)

24:12.118 --> 24:14.521
Come on, don't die on me!

24:14.554 --> 24:16.523
(grunting)

24:16.556 --> 24:19.992
(monitor flatlines)

24:20.026 --> 24:23.696
(flatlining continues)

24:23.730 --> 24:25.031
Abe... No, no, no, no.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.033
We just need to, we just need...
Abe.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.234
No, wait, wait.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.036
Abe.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.204
(flatlining continues)

24:32.238 --> 24:34.741
It's over.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.248
We did everything we could.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.537
(monitor stops)

25:07.707 --> 25:10.777
(device beeping)

25:13.846 --> 25:16.315
(beeping rapidly)

25:16.348 --> 25:19.719
Sir, a blackout just
happened in Tokyo.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.029
There's major
electrical activity

25:21.053 --> 25:23.089
coming from a single
building south of the city.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.232
It's the only one
that has power.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.625
Give me sat imagery.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.996
What is that?

25:30.029 --> 25:32.699
I have no idea.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.002
(box rattling)

25:36.035 --> 25:37.737
(eggs squishing)

25:51.718 --> 25:53.119
JACKSON: How's it
going over there?

25:53.152 --> 25:54.987
LOGAN: Just got fluid
from a razorback.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.289
Already got the snake thing.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.224
You?

25:58.257 --> 26:00.326
I extracted fluid
from the woolly rhino

26:00.359 --> 26:01.661
and the tentacle thing.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.765
So we still need the ape hybrid.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.033
Like Abendegos.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.145
Look,
we got about five minutes left.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.304
And we still haven't checked
the southeast quadrant.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.173
Why don't you meet me there?
DARIELA: Jackson,

26:14.206 --> 26:15.317
I have Abe on the line for you.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.943
He says it's important. Dariela,

26:16.976 --> 26:18.645
now is really not a great time.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.079
ABRAHAM: Rafiki...

26:20.112 --> 26:22.715
I'm afraid I have bad news.

26:22.749 --> 26:23.950
It's Abigail.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.652
We lost her.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.788
(sighs)

26:28.821 --> 26:32.124
Yeah. Uh...

26:32.158 --> 26:35.161
I'm sure you did
everything you could, huh?

26:39.732 --> 26:41.133
(egg cracks)

26:41.167 --> 26:43.135
(box rattling)

26:43.169 --> 26:45.204
(egg squishing)

26:49.241 --> 26:52.044
GARRISON: Get it up
on the big monitor.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.213
This just appeared in Tokyo.

26:54.246 --> 26:57.049
Do you know what it is?

26:59.886 --> 27:01.688
I think it's a beacon.

27:01.721 --> 27:02.831
GARRISON: I thought
they were designed

27:02.855 --> 27:03.990
to draw hybrids to them.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.157
DARIELA: They are.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.828
But look at the eggs.

27:08.861 --> 27:12.298
They've been on the
verge of hatching...

27:12.331 --> 27:15.101
until now.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.169
I think this might be
their wake-up call.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.741
Jackson?

27:21.774 --> 27:23.151
Logan,
I need you to drop everything

27:23.175 --> 27:24.310
and get out now.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.012
Say what? We're almost done.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.213
No, you are done.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.181
The eggs are hatching.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.215
Get out now!

27:48.768 --> 27:51.203
The combination we set wasn't
real, was it?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.808
No.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.911
I lied to you.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.847
It was easy as pie.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.881
(safe beeps)

28:03.082 --> 28:04.082
Don't move.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.120
Voice activation.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.460
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.899
Back away from the safe or
I will slice his throat.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.370
MAN: Hurry up!

28:24.403 --> 28:26.138
GARRISON: How many civilians

28:26.172 --> 28:28.107
are in the area?
I need a threat assessment.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.108
I'm on it.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.810
Abe, we think a beacon in Tokyo

28:30.843 --> 28:32.478
went off and a nest
in Korea is hatching.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.280
Jackson is in that
nest with Logan.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.991
I know, I'm working on
evacuating them now.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.049
How did this happen?

28:37.083 --> 28:37.917
I'm not sure.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.519
Abigail didn't
activate her beacons.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.955
Well, something did.
She's dead, Dariela.

28:46.192 --> 28:48.227
My God.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.198
What is that?

28:52.231 --> 28:54.076
What? Abe, talk to me.
There's something underneath

28:54.100 --> 28:55.501
the surface of her skin.

28:55.534 --> 28:56.836
Abe. Something mechanical.

28:56.869 --> 28:57.913
What are you looking at at?

28:57.937 --> 28:59.071
Take a look.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.008
MAX: What do you
think that does?

29:04.310 --> 29:07.013
A beacon was just
activated in Japan.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.782
I think this might be the cause.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.053
Okay.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.058
(device beeping) MAX: This...

29:19.091 --> 29:21.093
wasn't on when we opened her up.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.996
It must have activated
when her heart stopped.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.999
Like a "deadman's switch."

29:27.033 --> 29:29.001
We need to get it out.

29:29.035 --> 29:29.969
DARIELA: Abe.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.838
Do whatever you can to
shut that thing off,

29:31.871 --> 29:32.872
fast as you can.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.941
(taps keys) Guys.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.118
I need to evacuate that
building right now.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.243
LOGAN: We need to go.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.979
Logan,
we have to get that sample.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.123
No, trust me, it's not worth it.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.849
We need it to cure sterility.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.019
My toxin meter's on yellow.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.053
(egg splats)

29:49.555 --> 29:51.057
Got it.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.030
Let's go. Let's go! Move.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.065
JACKSON: Come on!

30:07.239 --> 30:09.976
Back away from the safe.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.143
Or Mitch Morgan dies.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.180
(quietly): Okay.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.023
You know, Abigail is dead.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.058
I told you.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.062
I'm programmed to
serve one person

30:30.096 --> 30:31.163
and one person only.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.068
You think you
thought this through?

30:36.102 --> 30:38.971
But you have no idea
what you've done.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.311
What are you talking about?

30:45.344 --> 30:48.047
By killing Abigail,

30:48.080 --> 30:50.582
you just ended the world.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.390
No witty comeback?

30:59.425 --> 31:01.527
Rosemary white.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.997
(grunts) (yells)

31:10.436 --> 31:13.172
Another nest just
went live in Jakarta.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.207
That's 3,000 miles from Seoul.

31:15.241 --> 31:19.345
Whatever turned that beacon
on, we need to shut it off.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.480
Abe, give me some good news.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.182
ABRAHAM: It won't come out.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.117
MAX: It's attached to the mastoid.
Pull harder.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.652
DARIELA: The Tokyo beacon

31:26.685 --> 31:28.320
is waking up more nests in Asia.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.423
It's broadcasting
further than we thought.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.457
(box rattling)

31:39.331 --> 31:43.069
We can't wait any longer.
We need to blow the nest now.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.272
The eggs are gonna
hatch any second.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.107
Jackson and Logan are inside.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.309
After being ordered to stay out?

31:50.342 --> 31:53.112
Yes. And if we blow it now,
the spores will be released

31:53.145 --> 31:54.981
into the city. I would rather

31:55.014 --> 31:57.016
deal with spores than
a thousand new hybrids.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.150
We need to hunt.

31:58.184 --> 32:00.319
We are blowing the nest, now.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.388
Not with my people inside.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.158
GARRISON: Whoa.

32:06.192 --> 32:09.095
Not yet. I need ten seconds.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.130
Jackson, Logan, can you hear me?

32:11.163 --> 32:12.398
Change of plans.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.166
Go to the southwest stairwell.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.367
What? Why?

32:15.401 --> 32:18.470
Just listen to me.
Go to the stairwell now.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.948
(alarm beeping)

32:33.052 --> 32:35.121
(devices trilling)

32:35.154 --> 32:37.323
(eggs bursting)

32:50.169 --> 32:51.670
Jackson?

32:51.703 --> 32:54.340
Logan, talk to me.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.116
(sighs)

33:04.150 --> 33:07.253
We're fine. We're okay.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.720
It's good to hear your voice.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.190
Guess we can knock that
one off our bucket list.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.192
You guys need to be Oscar
Mike before those spores

33:13.225 --> 33:15.027
filter through the dust.

33:15.061 --> 33:17.129
I'm gonna send an
exfil team to get you.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.298
Copy that. We'll be ready.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.334
Well played, Lieutenant.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.204
Well played.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.207
Enact an evac protocol
in a 50-mile radius

33:28.240 --> 33:29.541
of that parking garage.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.744
ABRAHAM: Okay,
Dariela, we got it out,

33:32.778 --> 33:35.247
but it's still transmitting.
MAX: Fascinating.

33:35.281 --> 33:37.049
Must be powered by some sort of

33:37.083 --> 33:38.450
new microbattery.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.086
Max, be fascinated later.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.363
This circuit is too
small for you to find

33:41.387 --> 33:43.122
a toggle switch to shut it off.

33:43.155 --> 33:46.258
Well, at the risk of
being too obvious...

33:46.292 --> 33:47.393
Max!

33:49.361 --> 33:50.362
Did it work?

33:54.100 --> 33:55.734
I'll be damned.

33:57.336 --> 34:00.339
(hissing)

34:02.841 --> 34:07.179
15 years ago, my unit captured
an unfriendly in Mosul.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.780
He was connected
to an ISIS cell,

34:08.813 --> 34:10.391
but our interrogators
couldn't break him.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.717
So we released and followed him.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.254
Led us right to our target.

34:15.286 --> 34:18.324
Since we can't stop the
signal, you want to trace it.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.326
ABRAHAM: Yes.
The trace will help us find

34:20.359 --> 34:21.726
where the rest of
the beacons are.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.163
I'll get Mitch.
We can use all the brainpower we can get.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.464
Okay.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.513
(Mitch grunts)

34:45.583 --> 34:47.553
Hey!

34:48.554 --> 34:50.456
The hell's going on here?

34:55.527 --> 34:56.527
(hissing)

35:04.203 --> 35:05.804
(snake hissing) Aah!

35:07.739 --> 35:09.775
Hey. (grunts)

35:13.579 --> 35:14.913
What the hell is
wrong with Mitch?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.448
It's not Mitch, that's Duncan.
What?

35:16.482 --> 35:17.683
I never changed him back.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.251
Mitch,
I could use some help here.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.252
What happened to the bio-drive?

35:20.286 --> 35:22.488
MAX: Remember the
camouflaged snake in Peru?

35:22.521 --> 35:23.631
I brought back an egg.
Apparently, it hatched.

35:23.655 --> 35:24.832
You brought one of those snakes

35:24.856 --> 35:25.857
onto my plane? Yeah.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.826
(snake hissing)

35:33.365 --> 35:36.202
We need to find a way to see it.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.704
Yeah.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.707
Oh, here, here.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.209
Throw these around.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.948
This is fascinating.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.484
The snake must have been
drawn to whatever wavelength

35:52.518 --> 35:53.728
the bio-drive
device was emitting.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.821
Not now, Max. Yeah.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.958
This can't be. (alarm beeping)

35:59.991 --> 36:01.860
DARIELA: That's a
new one in Australia.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.829
Another beacon's live.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.864
Have we located any
nests in Australia?

36:05.897 --> 36:07.266
No.

36:07.299 --> 36:10.969
Notify the ASIO field
office in Adelaide.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.238
That beacon means

36:12.271 --> 36:14.440
that there are
nests in Australia

36:14.473 --> 36:15.874
we haven't found yet.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.277
There could be hundreds
more around the world.

36:18.310 --> 36:22.214
If more beacons
activate, we are done.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.920
Abe, we need to know where
the rest of the beacons are.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.589
Believe me, I'm trying.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.658
Two have gone live.
We can't handle another one.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.260
Just give me some time.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.596
There...
there it is, there it is.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.903
(hisses, shrieks)

36:44.936 --> 36:46.505
(computer beeps)

36:46.538 --> 36:48.640
I don't believe it.

36:50.976 --> 36:54.813
Dariela, I have the raw
data, but it's dense.

36:54.846 --> 36:58.317
It's in the exabytes.
I can't decode this.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.685
Upload it, quick.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.353
(hissing)

37:06.692 --> 37:08.294
(snake shrieks)

37:20.639 --> 37:21.807
(squishing)

37:25.477 --> 37:27.313
I got it.

37:28.714 --> 37:29.915
(grunts)

37:31.317 --> 37:32.318
(grunts)

37:33.051 --> 37:34.320
(Jamie yells)

37:43.595 --> 37:44.930
(Jamie grunts)

37:46.765 --> 37:48.767
(grunts)

37:48.800 --> 37:50.402
You okay? Yeah.

37:50.436 --> 37:51.970
Yeah, yeah.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.041
You can get rid of me now,

37:56.074 --> 37:57.943
but the die has been cast.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.045
What do you mean?

38:00.078 --> 38:03.048
We left a treat for you.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.050
(groans)

38:07.085 --> 38:08.720
Death is only the beginning.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.889
Screw this. I want my son back!

38:10.922 --> 38:11.957
No, Max, wait.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.693
(device clicks, whirrs)

38:17.363 --> 38:18.564
(groans)

38:18.597 --> 38:20.799
Son... Mitch?

38:20.832 --> 38:24.670
Mitch, ten seconds ago,
you told me that you left me a treat.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.739
Do you remember what
you were talking about?

38:27.773 --> 38:30.442
Does that sound like
something I would ever say?

38:31.543 --> 38:32.644
Jamie... Okay,

38:32.678 --> 38:33.988
we need the schematics
of the plane.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.514
Look for weak spots...

38:35.547 --> 38:37.024
Anyplace they could have left a
bomb, sarin gas,

38:37.048 --> 38:38.350
anything. Go.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.018
Yeah.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.688
(computer beeping) Oh, yes.

38:46.692 --> 38:49.861
Sir, an exabyte of
raw data's coming in.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.573
It may contain the location
of the raw beacons.

38:51.597 --> 38:55.033
I need all available hands
to stop what they're doing.

38:55.066 --> 38:58.437
Data's coming in on
Lieutenant Kenyatta's socket

38:58.470 --> 39:00.105
that needs your full attention.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.076
Hey.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.721
He must have planted something
when I wasn't looking.

39:06.745 --> 39:07.889
The surveillance
will pick it up.

39:07.913 --> 39:10.582
I'm pulling up security footage now.
You need to stop.

39:10.616 --> 39:12.484
You're working off the
guilt of what you did.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.786
Jamie, Duncan lied,
that's all that it is.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.823
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.157
Wait, Duncan said that to me.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.630
Yeah,
he said it to me during surgery

39:20.659 --> 39:22.494
when we operated on Abigail.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.396
No, he said that
he left a-a treat,

39:24.430 --> 39:25.931
that the answer was simple.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.032
It was a deadman's switch,

39:27.065 --> 39:29.601
and it activated when Abigail died.
No, no, no.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.145
He said that death was
just the beginning.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.139
What if he wasn't talking about
his own death, but Abigail's?

39:36.742 --> 39:39.545
Dariela, after everything
that's happened between us

39:39.578 --> 39:41.847
the past few weeks, I...

39:41.880 --> 39:43.114
You don't need to say it.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.584
I do, and you need to hear it.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.722
We've both said and done
things that we regret.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.991
And we could both
keep rationalizing

39:53.024 --> 39:56.194
and apologizing,
but I just want to put it behind us

39:56.227 --> 39:57.696
and move forward.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.732
That being said,

40:00.766 --> 40:02.634
do you think the
IADG might have room

40:02.668 --> 40:04.570
for one more scientist?

40:04.603 --> 40:07.105
I promise I'll
make room for you.

40:08.674 --> 40:09.641
See you soon.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.677
I love you.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.045
