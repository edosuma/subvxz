01:54.637 --> 01:57.908
- Good morning.
- Fuck you.

02:33.075 --> 02:34.779
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.163
Hold this.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.075
Clear the ice!

03:40.577 --> 03:43.712
Lily! What are you doin'?

03:43.714 --> 03:47.484
Get off! Come on, bro!

03:49.652 --> 03:51.952
Sean... what the hell, man?!

03:51.954 --> 03:53.990
We're in the middle...

03:59.295 --> 04:02.297
Let's go!

04:02.299 --> 04:04.902
Sean, come on, man!

04:15.579 --> 04:19.779
So, honey, um, guess
who I ran into today.

04:19.781 --> 04:23.184
Sue, George's mother...
do you remember George?

04:23.186 --> 04:25.857
You went to science camp with
him. He was he smart kid.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.256
I don't remember.

04:29.258 --> 04:32.227
Curious George, that's what
you called him.

04:32.229 --> 04:36.064
Anyway, he remembers you
very fondly from science camp.

04:36.066 --> 04:38.566
- So, I was thinking that maybe...
- No.

04:38.568 --> 04:42.636
Um, Maria, you don't even know
what I was going to say next.

04:42.638 --> 04:44.542
Just... don't.

04:47.777 --> 04:49.677
Fine, if you don't want to hear
the rest of what...

04:49.679 --> 04:52.179
- I was gonna say, that's fine.
- No, she does.

04:52.181 --> 04:55.717
You know your mother's trying
to be helpful, right?

04:55.719 --> 04:57.855
Right?

04:59.121 --> 05:01.057
Yes.

05:02.592 --> 05:05.193
Here was my idea, just that
you're here and George...

05:05.195 --> 05:07.595
is here and and you both like
each other...

05:07.597 --> 05:10.764
so the winter prom is coming up,
you could go to it together.

05:10.766 --> 05:13.667
- I'm not going to the prom.
- Why not?

05:13.669 --> 05:17.138
Because it's stupid and I
don't want any part of it.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.674
But it's such a
beautiful tradition.

05:19.676 --> 05:21.977
You're really gonna be missing
out, it's your senior year.

05:21.979 --> 05:23.881
Missing out on what?!

05:36.826 --> 05:39.259
That went well.

05:39.261 --> 05:41.763
I guess she just needs time
to come out of her shell.

05:41.765 --> 05:43.030
Christ, Amy, she's nearly 18.

05:43.032 --> 05:45.066
Well, she's a late bloomer.

05:45.068 --> 05:48.703
- She has no friends.
- She's friends with Lily.

05:48.705 --> 05:50.338
Lily's a habit, not a friend.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.107
She has no social life.
She has no confidence.

05:53.109 --> 05:54.675
As far as I'm aware...

05:54.677 --> 05:56.710
she's never even had a
conversation with a boy.

05:56.712 --> 05:57.679
She doesn't touch her food.

05:57.681 --> 05:59.413
She weighs less than
she did two years ago.

05:59.415 --> 06:04.985
Wake up, Amy! Just look at her!
Look at her!

06:04.987 --> 06:06.687
We have a screwed-up daughter.

06:06.689 --> 06:09.323
You're too hard on her...

06:09.325 --> 06:12.694
you just need to give
her time to blossom.

06:12.696 --> 06:16.299
Blossom into what?

10:12.668 --> 10:15.602
Hey, sweetie.

10:15.604 --> 10:18.072
Dad, um....

10:18.074 --> 10:20.341
- Mm-hm?
- Last night...

10:20.343 --> 10:22.910
I don't really know what
to make of it...

10:22.912 --> 10:26.146
but I... I just wanted to ask
you something.

10:26.148 --> 10:28.650
Did you get any sleep?

10:28.652 --> 10:31.685
Yeah, I... well, I mean...

10:31.687 --> 10:33.154
I mean, no I didn't sleep well
last night.

10:33.156 --> 10:34.655
You look terrible.

10:34.657 --> 10:36.457
You sure you wanna go to
school looking like that?

10:36.459 --> 10:37.925
What?

10:37.927 --> 10:39.694
Honey, look, I know it's
a jungle out there...

10:39.696 --> 10:42.130
but you gotta put your best
face forward.

10:42.132 --> 10:44.265
- Don't you wanna look your best?
- I do, but I...

10:44.267 --> 10:45.967
What's going on?

10:45.969 --> 10:49.036
She didn't get any sleep...
again.

10:49.038 --> 10:51.305
Look, a good night's sleep is
essential for all of us...

10:51.307 --> 10:54.174
but particularly for a
young girl who's growing.

10:54.176 --> 10:55.443
Why don't you do
yourself a favor?

10:55.445 --> 10:58.378
Hop upstairs, put
some make-up on.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.048
You'll look better
and you'll feel better.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.115
Promise you, trust me.

11:01.117 --> 11:03.351
But her omelette
will get all cold.

11:03.353 --> 11:04.955
We both know she's not
gonna eat the omelette.

11:05.622 --> 11:07.124
Go on, upstairs.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.193
Honey, what's wrong?

11:12.195 --> 11:15.963
Sweetie, go... now.

11:15.965 --> 11:17.200
Never mind.

12:49.225 --> 12:51.559
Good morning.

12:51.561 --> 12:54.295
Hey.

12:54.297 --> 12:57.131
So, what do you think?

12:57.133 --> 13:02.203
- It's nice.
- Nice?

13:02.205 --> 13:05.372
Okay, it's... it's really nice.

13:05.374 --> 13:07.141
Nice is a boy you
don't wanna go out with.

13:07.143 --> 13:14.082
This is an acid green,
turbo-charged 911.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.415
This is definitely not nice.

13:18.687 --> 13:20.723
Woo! Woohoo! Woo!

13:31.533 --> 13:35.104
Yeah, I'm coming!

13:40.143 --> 13:42.676
Whoa.

13:42.678 --> 13:45.146
Sorry, Maria.

13:45.148 --> 13:48.152
Sweet ride. Hey, baby.

14:01.364 --> 14:03.367
That's not funny.

14:09.471 --> 14:11.204
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

14:11.206 --> 14:13.210
I really didn't mean to do that.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.146
Maybe she should
watch where she's going.

14:19.148 --> 14:20.780
You all right?

14:20.782 --> 14:25.556
Wow, Sean, your bar has
really lowered, huh?

14:26.755 --> 14:28.322
You fuck with...!

14:28.324 --> 14:30.857
Oy! Chill! Back up, Paul.

14:30.859 --> 14:34.161
- Hey, baby, it's not worth it.
- Fuckin' punk.

14:34.163 --> 14:37.330
- See you at practice.
- Seriously?

14:37.332 --> 14:39.266
Little bitch! Light's out!

14:39.268 --> 14:42.239
- You okay?
- Yeah.

14:43.907 --> 14:46.609
- Should we go?
- Okay.

15:47.336 --> 15:50.340
<i>Maria.</i>

15:53.008 --> 15:54.945
<i>Maria.</i>

17:04.313 --> 17:05.881
You're not real.

17:09.351 --> 17:11.454
I'm imagining you.

17:15.523 --> 17:18.461
Why am I seeing you?

17:20.362 --> 17:22.897
Because I'm here.

17:25.501 --> 17:29.306
Who... who are you?

17:32.341 --> 17:34.642
You don't remember me?

17:34.644 --> 17:38.713
- I don't know you.
- I've always been here.

17:38.715 --> 17:43.684
Look in the window...
I'm everywhere where you are.

17:43.686 --> 17:48.856
Whenever you see yourself,
what you really see is me.

17:48.858 --> 17:51.024
How long have you been here?

17:51.026 --> 17:53.394
How long have you?

17:53.396 --> 17:55.762
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

17:55.764 --> 17:58.467
What do you want from me?

17:59.502 --> 18:03.404
I can take your sadness away.

18:03.406 --> 18:09.876
Listen, I'm here for you,
I know you.

18:09.878 --> 18:14.482
I know your secret
desires, your fears...

18:14.484 --> 18:18.754
who you love, who you hate.

18:20.455 --> 18:23.656
I understand you completely.

18:23.658 --> 18:27.560
- But you aren't me?
- No.

18:27.562 --> 18:30.530
- Who are you then?
- Look at me.

18:30.532 --> 18:34.501
- What?
- Look at me.

18:34.503 --> 18:35.770
What do you see?

18:35.772 --> 18:39.507
I s... I see what I look like.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.511
What do you look like?

18:48.451 --> 18:54.358
I... you're beautiful.

18:56.458 --> 18:59.528
We are beautiful.

19:06.601 --> 19:08.938
Do you have a name?

19:11.139 --> 19:13.441
Airam.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.045
Airam.

19:31.793 --> 19:33.092
Hey.

19:33.094 --> 19:37.865
Honey, you lookin' really
good today.

19:37.867 --> 19:42.669
Yeah, I see it, you had your
beauty sleep, I can tell.

19:42.671 --> 19:45.473
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.741
Good for you, honey.

19:47.743 --> 19:51.544
Um, I've decided I'm gonna go
to the winter prom after all.

19:51.546 --> 19:53.914
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

19:53.916 --> 19:57.684
Honey, that's wonderful.
So who's the lucky guy?

19:57.686 --> 20:00.588
- No one.
- No one yet.

20:00.590 --> 20:04.558
You know, the main thing
is that she's going. Right?

20:04.560 --> 20:07.496
Which is great. You're making an
effort to be part of something.

20:17.173 --> 20:18.606
Hey, Lily.

20:18.608 --> 20:22.510
Hey, are we gonna hit
the ice today?

20:22.512 --> 20:24.211
You wanna learn how to skate?

20:24.213 --> 20:26.579
Yeah, I'm teaching her
for winter prom.

20:26.581 --> 20:29.183
Oh, that's great, who are you
going with?

20:29.185 --> 20:31.754
No one... yet.

20:34.023 --> 20:35.990
So are we gonna skate
today or...?

20:35.992 --> 20:39.792
Oh shit, no, um, it's Thursday.

20:39.794 --> 20:44.264
I have that bonding date
with my dad.

20:44.266 --> 20:46.032
You Brennans are so weird.

20:46.034 --> 20:47.937
You don't know the half of it.

20:50.138 --> 20:51.605
Okay, well, tomorrow then?

20:51.607 --> 20:54.610
Tomorrow.

20:56.712 --> 20:58.678
She wants to learn how to skate?

20:58.680 --> 21:02.081
- Yeah, you wanna teach her?
- No.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.220
It's just not like her,
that's all.

21:39.621 --> 21:41.955
He's just with a patient,
take a seat, darling.

21:41.957 --> 21:43.723
- He'll be right out.
- Okay.

21:43.725 --> 21:44.895
Okay.

21:50.899 --> 21:53.235
That's 278.

21:54.971 --> 21:59.876
And this one is... 286.

22:01.744 --> 22:02.809
- May I?
- Yes.

22:02.811 --> 22:04.377
Thank you.

22:04.379 --> 22:07.380
What we're gonna do is we are
going to relocate...

22:07.382 --> 22:13.289
your nipples back up here
where they belong.

22:14.657 --> 22:17.691
Slip an implant under here
and here...

22:17.693 --> 22:20.763
and they are gonna be perky
and perfect.

22:32.207 --> 22:34.875
So how's school, Maria?

22:34.877 --> 22:36.175
It's good.

22:36.177 --> 22:38.779
You're lucky to be
in high school.

22:38.781 --> 22:40.380
I miss that time so much.

22:40.382 --> 22:45.284
No worries, all you care about
are guys, right?

22:45.286 --> 22:48.755
Naomi, could you go through the
forms with Ms. Robinson, please?

22:48.757 --> 22:50.156
And schedule a mammoplasty...

22:50.158 --> 22:52.225
and an abdominoplasty
for a few weeks.

22:52.227 --> 22:55.294
Hey, hun... hi.

22:55.296 --> 22:56.829
- Hi.
- Claudia.

22:56.831 --> 22:58.398
Do we have an appointment today?

22:58.400 --> 23:01.268
No, I just wanted to see
if it's coming along okay.

23:01.270 --> 23:04.104
Please?

23:04.106 --> 23:07.307
I really can't today,
my daughter's here for a date.

23:07.309 --> 23:09.842
You're here early, aren't you?
Did we not say 6:00?

23:09.844 --> 23:12.046
Yeah, sorry.

23:12.048 --> 23:15.315
Can't you squeeze me
in for like ten minutes?

23:15.317 --> 23:18.819
Why don't I just check
it right now? Here we go.

23:18.821 --> 23:22.690
All right, here we go.

23:22.692 --> 23:26.997
That is looking just fine.

23:33.802 --> 23:35.868
<i>I'll remember you
just like this.</i>

23:35.870 --> 23:38.972
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:47.882 --> 23:49.450
<i>I thought this weekend
would never come.</i>

23:49.452 --> 23:55.055
<i>Me, too. I love you so much.</i>

23:55.057 --> 23:56.893
<i>I love you, too.</i>

24:14.877 --> 24:16.809
Are you okay, honey?

24:16.811 --> 24:18.113
Yeah.

24:19.281 --> 24:20.280
- Oh.
- Hey.

24:20.282 --> 24:24.751
Maria, hey, oh, what's good?

24:24.753 --> 24:27.921
I don't think we've ever met
before, you must be Dr. Brennan.

24:27.923 --> 24:30.124
- And you are?
- Mark.

24:30.126 --> 24:32.492
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Doctor.

24:32.494 --> 24:35.294
I'm actually considering
going into pre-med myself.

24:35.296 --> 24:37.463
I'd love to sit down with
you, pick your brain sometime...

24:37.465 --> 24:40.299
if that wouldn't be too much
trouble.

24:40.301 --> 24:41.568
Sure.

24:41.570 --> 24:45.708
Great, and Maria, I guess I'll
just see you around in school.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.733
That was brutal.

25:21.342 --> 25:25.311
You know, your birthday's
coming up in a couple months.

25:25.313 --> 25:27.146
What would you say to getting
your gift...

25:27.148 --> 25:29.883
a little early this year?

25:29.885 --> 25:31.484
I... I'd say yes.

25:31.486 --> 25:34.387
Swing by the office tomorrow
after school.

25:34.389 --> 25:35.792
Sure.

25:39.294 --> 25:40.927
Daddy.

25:40.929 --> 25:42.865
What?

25:45.067 --> 25:46.770
Never mind.

26:12.628 --> 26:14.964
You really believe he cares,
don't you?

26:19.334 --> 26:22.204
- He does.
- Oh, come on, Maria.

26:24.039 --> 26:27.473
He was embarrassed, that's all.

26:27.475 --> 26:31.979
You're just a stain on his
family.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.348
No, you're wrong.

26:34.350 --> 26:37.017
He does care and he's gonna
buy me my car early...

26:37.019 --> 26:38.918
because he doesn't want me
riding the bus...

26:38.920 --> 26:40.119
with those idiots anymore.

26:40.121 --> 26:43.025
- You heard him.
- I heard him.

26:44.659 --> 26:46.326
What do you know anyway?

26:46.328 --> 26:48.431
Nothing that you don't already.

26:49.965 --> 26:52.598
Shh.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.338
You know, you're
overreacting, okay?

27:12.021 --> 27:13.921
You ready?

27:13.923 --> 27:15.859
Is it in there?

27:18.627 --> 27:20.363
Come on.

27:26.135 --> 27:28.301
It's here.

27:28.303 --> 27:29.936
What?

27:29.938 --> 27:35.107
I know who you see
in the mirror.

27:35.109 --> 27:37.109
It doesn't matter what's real.

27:37.111 --> 27:39.413
What matters is how you feel...

27:39.415 --> 27:44.253
and I wanna make you feel
beautiful.

27:52.962 --> 27:56.296
I'm your dad, think I don't know
why you don't wear your hair...

27:56.298 --> 27:58.568
back in a ponytail? Hm.

28:00.601 --> 28:04.172
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

28:06.641 --> 28:12.547
Take this, which is eight
millimeters...

28:16.685 --> 28:21.053
and this, which is six.

28:21.055 --> 28:24.057
We're gonna round the top
of these pointy bits off...

28:24.059 --> 28:27.394
and they're gonna be amazing.

28:27.396 --> 28:31.033
Then, here, lift 'em.

28:32.634 --> 28:35.068
I know.

28:35.070 --> 28:40.139
Yeah, we're gonna take this
sweet, little snub nose...

28:40.141 --> 28:44.444
we're just gonna slim down
the cartilage at the top...

28:44.446 --> 28:48.214
and just extend the tip
a teeny bit.

28:48.216 --> 28:51.050
It's gonna look sophisticated
and amazing...

28:51.052 --> 28:54.221
and we're gonna accentuate the
cupid's bow...

28:54.223 --> 28:56.088
show those fabulous teeth...

28:56.090 --> 28:59.262
and let that smile come
shining through.

29:00.596 --> 29:05.365
And that's my gift to you.

29:05.367 --> 29:08.404
Say yes.

29:09.303 --> 29:13.072
- Yes.
- Yeah?

29:13.074 --> 29:16.076
Mm-hm.

29:16.078 --> 29:18.414
Let's go eat.

29:49.778 --> 29:51.711
You were right.

29:51.713 --> 29:56.082
You have no one taking
care of you out there.

29:56.084 --> 29:59.251
Well, there's Mom.

29:59.253 --> 30:00.654
She's weak.

30:00.656 --> 30:03.690
She'll do everything he tells
her, and you know why.

30:03.692 --> 30:08.194
Because she still thinks
he gives a shit about her.

30:08.196 --> 30:10.600
That's right.

30:13.234 --> 30:15.335
God, they really are something.
Aren't they?

30:15.337 --> 30:18.338
Hm. I mean, he doesn't
give a fuck and she...

30:18.340 --> 30:20.208
Desperately needs one.

30:27.182 --> 30:30.783
Mom, don't you know
you're supposed to knock?

30:32.454 --> 30:34.588
- Who were you talking to?
- No one.

30:34.590 --> 30:40.460
- I just heard you!
- It's no one.

30:40.462 --> 30:41.664
I thought of something funny.

30:45.567 --> 30:48.503
Are you smoking pot in here?

30:51.807 --> 30:54.143
What are you doing?

30:57.579 --> 30:59.648
What's wrong with you?

31:03.886 --> 31:05.217
Maybe she was on the phone.

31:05.219 --> 31:06.685
No! I w... I was in there
with her!

31:06.687 --> 31:08.320
It was as though there was
someone else there...

31:08.322 --> 31:10.757
in the room with her and she was
laughing strangely...

31:10.759 --> 31:12.591
and I tried to get through
to her, but I couldn't.

31:12.593 --> 31:14.226
- Okay, okay. Ssh-ssh... okay.
- Are you listening to me, Dan?

31:14.228 --> 31:16.562
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm listening to you.

31:16.564 --> 31:18.531
She has problems, okay?
We know this.

31:18.533 --> 31:20.166
- No, but...
- This is not news.

31:20.168 --> 31:22.202
Oh, come on. I don't need that.
That's not...

31:22.204 --> 31:23.669
Please hear me out.

31:23.671 --> 31:25.371
Please! I have a very strong
feeling about this.

31:25.373 --> 31:26.839
- You're having a panic attack.
- If you would've seen this...

31:26.841 --> 31:28.375
- Amy! Amy!
- I'm not! I'm not!

31:28.377 --> 31:32.447
Amy, stop, breathe.
Let me help you.

31:37.753 --> 31:39.722
Open up.

31:41.523 --> 31:44.627
Drink up... look.

31:48.463 --> 31:52.799
Okay, now get your breath back,
it's gonna be alright.

31:52.801 --> 31:54.701
Everything's gonna be alright.
You know why?

31:54.703 --> 31:56.302
Why?

31:56.304 --> 31:58.672
'Cause I know what I'm doing
and I'm taking care of it.

31:58.674 --> 32:01.340
- Do you believe me?
- Yeah.

32:01.342 --> 32:02.375
Okay.

32:02.377 --> 32:05.278
Ssh-ssh.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.282
Alright.

32:09.350 --> 32:13.321
Ssh.

32:23.432 --> 32:26.700
They've come back.

32:26.702 --> 32:28.838
The dreams?

32:31.840 --> 32:38.380
Well, they'll go away,
they always do.

32:40.715 --> 32:43.619
But then they always come back.

33:50.051 --> 33:51.984
Oh, the old club house.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.853
We haven't been here
since we were like four.

33:53.855 --> 33:56.623
Yeah, no one really
comes now that it's closed.

33:56.625 --> 33:59.358
It's a shame, it's really
pretty.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.393
Yeah.

34:00.395 --> 34:04.496
- Should we put these on?
- Okay.

34:04.498 --> 34:06.665
That's it! That's it!

34:06.667 --> 34:08.634
Now, I'm gonna let go of you,
okay?

34:08.636 --> 34:11.337
No, Lily, wait. Don't. Please.

34:11.339 --> 34:13.473
We're just gonna go to the club
house, it's fine.

34:13.475 --> 34:14.840
- Okay?
- No.

34:14.842 --> 34:16.076
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't. Don't. Don't.

34:16.078 --> 34:20.512
Look at me. You're gonna have
to do it on your own eventually.

34:20.514 --> 34:23.483
You can't hold on to me forever.

34:23.485 --> 34:28.355
- Okay.
- Okay? That's it, come on.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.358
Head up! Head up!

34:31.625 --> 34:33.962
No, I can't, I can't do this.

34:40.701 --> 34:45.440
Ow! Lily, come on, help me up.

34:47.542 --> 34:50.442
- He's mine, you know?
- What? Who?

34:50.444 --> 34:52.978
You know who I'm talking about.

34:52.980 --> 34:55.350
No, I don't.

34:59.721 --> 35:02.054
Where are you going?

35:02.056 --> 35:03.491
Lily!

35:08.964 --> 35:10.565
Lily, come on!

35:11.933 --> 35:13.869
Lily!

35:51.940 --> 35:54.808
You wanna believe in it,
don't you?

35:54.810 --> 35:57.744
What?

35:57.746 --> 36:01.581
That she's your friend,
that she cares about you.

36:01.583 --> 36:03.882
She is my friend.

36:03.884 --> 36:06.552
But you're not so sure of that
now, are you?

36:06.554 --> 36:09.621
We've been best friends
since we were three.

36:09.623 --> 36:12.491
I was there too, remember?

36:12.493 --> 36:15.594
I remember when she left
you alone in the sand box.

36:15.596 --> 36:17.063
All alone, by yourself...

36:17.065 --> 36:19.098
because she wanted to play
with the other girls.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.099
That never happened.

36:21.101 --> 36:23.802
I was there when you made a pact
not to sit next to each other...

36:23.804 --> 36:25.204
on the first day of grade
school.

36:25.206 --> 36:27.607
No, she was late that day.

36:27.609 --> 36:31.677
- The teacher seated her next to...
- No!

36:31.679 --> 36:35.614
She was there before you
arrived, Maria...

36:35.616 --> 36:37.916
sitting next to little Chloe...

36:37.918 --> 36:42.020
acting like she didn't know
who you were.

36:42.022 --> 36:44.724
And poor little you,
you were there...

36:44.726 --> 36:46.625
in your little, pink dress...

36:46.627 --> 36:50.963
because she told you it made you
look as pretty as a princess.

36:50.965 --> 36:54.569
You didn't remember that,
did you?

36:58.540 --> 37:05.911
But I do, I remember all
of those moments.

37:05.913 --> 37:08.748
I remember when she'd laugh
behind your back...

37:08.750 --> 37:11.817
and roll her eyes when you
weren't looking.

37:11.819 --> 37:13.955
I remember all of those things.

37:16.757 --> 37:19.125
All of those things
that you choose to forget.

37:19.127 --> 37:22.594
Just like you wanted to forget
her leaving you...

37:22.596 --> 37:24.530
lying on the ice today.

37:24.532 --> 37:26.532
No. No. No.

37:26.534 --> 37:28.067
But I won't let
you forget, Maria...

37:28.069 --> 37:31.873
because that's
what real friends do.

37:35.576 --> 37:36.978
They share their pain.

37:40.181 --> 37:44.683
And you have so
much inside of you.

37:44.685 --> 37:47.055
But I can take all of
those feelings away.

37:50.958 --> 37:56.031
Trust me, and you trust
in yourself.

37:57.331 --> 38:02.071
Let me help you, be there
for you...

38:03.203 --> 38:05.273
instead of you.

38:13.647 --> 38:15.149
Come on.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.817
I can fix things.

38:25.659 --> 38:27.996
Give me your other hand.

38:38.339 --> 38:40.275
Kiss me.

38:50.618 --> 38:53.186
Maria?

38:53.188 --> 38:54.954
Yeah, Mom?

38:54.956 --> 38:59.161
I have a surprise for you.
Open up.

39:02.096 --> 39:07.366
This is your time to shine.
Look.

39:07.368 --> 39:12.105
Look at you, like an angel.

39:12.107 --> 39:15.375
Honey, I want you to promise
me something, okay?

39:15.377 --> 39:19.047
Will you promise me that
you will have a good time?

39:22.683 --> 39:24.619
Can you promise me that?

39:26.221 --> 39:29.090
Please, darling,
please promise me.

39:30.692 --> 39:33.659
I promise.

40:11.065 --> 40:14.701
Yeah! Whoo!

40:14.703 --> 40:16.205
Hey, watch it!

40:20.875 --> 40:22.277
Nice!

40:47.268 --> 40:49.170
You want to go?

42:02.810 --> 42:04.976
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!

42:04.978 --> 42:07.381
No!

42:24.565 --> 42:25.831
- Woo!
- Agh!

42:25.833 --> 42:27.833
Woo-hoo! Fun!

42:27.835 --> 42:31.270
Stop! Agh!

42:31.272 --> 42:33.438
Somebody help her!

42:33.440 --> 42:36.043
Do it! Do it!

42:40.181 --> 42:42.518
Hey, watch out!

42:47.922 --> 42:50.092
You're such a jerk!

42:54.962 --> 42:57.498
Is she okay?

43:16.583 --> 43:19.886
Airam?

43:19.888 --> 43:22.190
Airam, are you there?

43:24.525 --> 43:27.029
Airam, I need you now.

43:30.063 --> 43:32.033
Please come back.

43:35.936 --> 43:38.473
Please come back, I need you.

43:49.683 --> 43:51.519
Maria.

44:00.560 --> 44:06.267
Now... let me take your pain
away.

44:13.007 --> 44:15.210
Just close your eyes...

44:19.080 --> 44:21.583
and kiss me.

46:12.493 --> 46:15.161
Agh!

46:15.163 --> 46:16.531
Oh, it hurts!

46:21.368 --> 46:23.735
Agh, something's wrong! Agh!

46:23.737 --> 46:26.507
Help me! Agh!

47:20.761 --> 47:22.261
So how was it?

47:22.263 --> 47:24.295
How was what?

47:24.297 --> 47:26.467
The prom.

47:28.302 --> 47:32.174
It was perfect, just perfect.

47:33.306 --> 47:34.739
That's so great.

47:34.741 --> 47:37.442
So, tell me more. Did you
have a fabulous time?

47:37.444 --> 47:40.612
Did you... did you dance
with anyone?

47:40.614 --> 47:44.916
Mom, it was everything
I wished for.

47:44.918 --> 47:47.920
- I'm starving!
- We have fresh bagels.

47:47.922 --> 47:49.257
Mm!

47:53.728 --> 47:56.865
Well, someone's got
her appetite back.

47:58.498 --> 48:01.168
I'm sorry, I haven't been
myself lately.

48:07.909 --> 48:09.711
Mm!

48:54.889 --> 48:57.956
- Oh shit.
- Shut up.

48:57.958 --> 48:59.460
Morning, ice queen.

49:00.962 --> 49:02.464
Oh, shit.

49:08.469 --> 49:10.804
Whoo! Yeah! Ha-ha!

49:23.317 --> 49:25.619
You're not laughing.

49:30.790 --> 49:34.862
What? Am I not funny anymore?

49:41.302 --> 49:44.706
Or is that 'cause you get a
hard on every time you see me?

49:57.384 --> 49:59.751
Dude, what happened?

49:59.753 --> 50:02.790
- She was feeling you up.
- Shut the fuck up, man!

50:06.360 --> 50:07.862
Hey!

50:09.929 --> 50:12.463
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

50:12.465 --> 50:14.433
What happened back there?

50:14.435 --> 50:16.302
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

50:16.304 --> 50:20.538
He's still shaking, what...
what'd you say to him?

50:20.540 --> 50:24.311
Uh, I told him...

50:29.884 --> 50:31.586
Wow. Uh...

50:32.886 --> 50:38.824
Oh, um, I think this belongs
to you.

50:38.826 --> 50:39.994
Oh.

50:41.761 --> 50:44.797
Well, what are you doing?

50:44.799 --> 50:48.500
I was just giving Maria her pin
back.

50:48.502 --> 50:49.871
See ya.

50:59.380 --> 51:01.612
Are you okay?

51:01.614 --> 51:03.782
I'm so sorry about what
happened last night.

51:03.784 --> 51:07.719
That was... it was fucking wrong.

51:07.721 --> 51:12.358
- Was it?
- Yeah, it was shameful.

51:12.360 --> 51:16.464
Is that what you felt? Shame?

51:18.898 --> 51:21.833
Hey, look, I didn't do
anything wrong. Okay?

51:21.835 --> 51:24.605
- I tried to stop them, but...
- Sure.

51:29.476 --> 51:32.511
You're not quitting on me now,
are you?

51:32.513 --> 51:34.045
Quitting?

51:34.047 --> 51:36.514
You said you were
gonna teach me to skate.

51:36.516 --> 51:39.851
You still want to?

51:39.853 --> 51:41.520
Why not?

51:41.522 --> 51:43.822
Well, after prom...

51:43.824 --> 51:46.561
What's the point, Maria?

51:48.628 --> 51:50.864
Self-improvement.

52:51.491 --> 52:53.894
Hey, honey. What's up?

52:57.063 --> 52:58.864
Hi, Daddy.

52:58.866 --> 53:01.136
Hey.

53:04.839 --> 53:07.505
Did we have a lunch date
or something?

53:07.507 --> 53:09.843
Did I forget anything or...?

53:11.244 --> 53:15.016
Huh... okay, so?

53:35.101 --> 53:37.138
I missed you.

53:39.507 --> 53:41.940
That's nice.

53:41.942 --> 53:45.013
And I... I missed you, too.

53:47.748 --> 53:49.614
<i>Dr. Brennan?</i>

53:49.616 --> 53:53.050
- <i>Can I send in the next patient?</i>
- <i>Just hold on a second!</i>

53:53.052 --> 53:56.188
Sweetie, what's going on?

53:56.190 --> 53:58.023
Is something wrong? You need
something?

53:58.025 --> 54:00.595
I can... something I can do?

54:05.098 --> 54:08.769
All right, well, I guess
I'll see you at home.

54:24.817 --> 54:26.985
Sharon, he's ready for you.

54:26.987 --> 54:29.221
You want me to call you a cab?

54:29.223 --> 54:31.223
No, I'll take a bus.

54:31.225 --> 54:33.824
Hey, we don't have any more
of that delicious hot cocoa?

54:33.826 --> 54:36.561
You want me to fix you one
for the road?

54:36.563 --> 54:37.929
Hm...

54:37.931 --> 54:39.801
I'll take that as a yes.

55:00.119 --> 55:02.820
Hi, this is Dr. Brennan's
office.

55:02.822 --> 55:04.255
We have an opening for an
appointment...

55:04.257 --> 55:07.726
at 1:00 o'clock, if you're
interested?

55:07.728 --> 55:09.293
Great.

55:09.295 --> 55:11.632
We'll let him know
you're coming.

55:16.170 --> 55:19.605
I took the liberty of throwing
in some marshmallows.

55:19.607 --> 55:22.741
Mm. Thank you, oh,
and I almost forgot!

55:22.743 --> 55:24.643
Dad wants you to have Mom
pick him up here...

55:24.645 --> 55:27.346
for a romantic lunch date
at 1:00 o'clock.

55:27.348 --> 55:29.284
- Sure thing.
- Okay.

55:46.799 --> 55:51.369
Hello? Hi, Naomi.

55:51.371 --> 55:54.172
He does?

55:54.174 --> 55:57.375
Today?

55:57.377 --> 56:01.748
Yeah, he is the best.

56:03.384 --> 56:05.416
Okay... oh, in an hour.

56:05.418 --> 56:09.257
Okay, great, see you,
yeah okay, thanks.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.407
That's a pretty dress.

57:03.409 --> 57:06.880
Oh, thank you, it's Dr. Dan's
favorite.

57:28.435 --> 57:31.205
Where's Daddy?

57:34.808 --> 57:38.378
- Is he working late?
- Mm.

57:43.417 --> 57:46.751
Is he working late?

57:46.753 --> 57:50.058
Probably, yes.

57:51.958 --> 57:53.425
Uh, how's the tofu steak?

57:53.427 --> 57:55.893
It doesn't even look
like you've touched it.

57:55.895 --> 57:57.898
It's just like your marriage.

58:01.235 --> 58:02.400
What?

58:02.402 --> 58:06.007
A stale imitation of the real
thing.

58:07.875 --> 58:10.878
Have you lost your mind?

58:12.846 --> 58:14.779
Where's Dad?

58:14.781 --> 58:16.815
I just told you.

58:16.817 --> 58:18.516
He's probably got some extra
procedures...

58:18.518 --> 58:22.087
and he's going to be
at the office late.

58:22.089 --> 58:26.491
Please stop smiling at me
like that.

58:26.493 --> 58:31.163
Why don't you tell the truth?
It's so liberating.

58:31.165 --> 58:34.933
Try it.

58:34.935 --> 58:36.802
Dad is not working late.

58:36.804 --> 58:38.804
See?

58:38.806 --> 58:42.541
What are you talking about?

58:42.543 --> 58:46.311
- Say it.
- Say what?

58:46.313 --> 58:47.846
Just say that you're tired...

58:47.848 --> 58:50.351
of him fucking all those
other women.

58:57.156 --> 58:59.357
Oh, I'm sorry.

58:59.359 --> 59:02.295
I don't know what came over me,
I'm so sorry.

59:04.431 --> 59:05.532
I'm not.

59:12.973 --> 59:15.072
What are you looking at?

59:15.074 --> 59:17.208
What do you think you're doing?

59:17.210 --> 59:19.009
Having dinner with Mom.

59:19.011 --> 59:20.911
Why were you so mean to her?

59:20.913 --> 59:24.248
- Was I lying?
- No.

59:24.250 --> 59:27.219
Am I not doing what
you've always wanted to do?

59:27.221 --> 59:29.154
Saying what you've
always wanted to say?

59:29.156 --> 59:31.391
Everything you didn't dare.

59:32.525 --> 59:33.659
Maybe.

59:33.661 --> 59:37.228
It's about time for the truth
to surface, isn't it?

59:37.230 --> 59:38.329
I guess.

59:38.331 --> 59:43.034
Just follow me, stop resisting.

59:43.036 --> 59:45.904
She deserves it, they all do.

59:45.906 --> 59:48.105
It's time they learned that.

59:48.107 --> 59:51.812
- Learned what?
- That they've sinned.

59:53.045 --> 59:55.614
Against who?

59:55.616 --> 59:58.286
Against who?!

01:01:05.018 --> 01:01:07.154
You're dead.

01:01:21.268 --> 01:01:23.134
- See you later, man.
- See you.

01:01:23.136 --> 01:01:25.940
- Later, man.
- Yeah, late.

01:02:32.739 --> 01:02:38.175
Fuck! Aw! Fuck, my knee!

01:02:38.177 --> 01:02:40.114
Fuck!

01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:45.185
Agh! Fuck!

01:02:51.558 --> 01:02:53.627
Ssh.

01:03:22.355 --> 01:03:24.324
It's good to see you smiling.

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:52.416
Okay.

01:03:52.418 --> 01:03:54.251
That's it. That's it!

01:03:54.253 --> 01:03:56.587
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:59.324
Cool, yeah, that's it!

01:03:59.326 --> 01:04:01.395
Maria, that's great!

01:04:04.163 --> 01:04:06.399
Jeez, have you been practicing?

01:04:14.241 --> 01:04:15.576
Whoa.

01:04:21.514 --> 01:04:23.116
Whoa.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.531
Holy shit!

01:06:13.692 --> 01:06:14.727
Hm.

01:08:06.605 --> 01:08:08.373
Hello?! Can you please
come quick?!

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.909
Yeah, I'm here with my friend
and she she's fallen and I...

01:08:11.911 --> 01:08:14.712
I think she's dead. Oh God!

01:08:14.714 --> 01:08:18.582
Um yeah, we're at the old
club house on Wellington.

01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:22.988
Please come quickly!
Please hurry.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:31.996
We still have a couple
questions for your daughter.

01:08:31.997 --> 01:08:35.435
Well, can it wait? I mean,
she's been through so much.

01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:43.975
Sure. We'll stay in touch.

01:08:43.977 --> 01:08:45.645
Thank you.

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:07.564
Why are you doing this?

01:09:07.566 --> 01:09:10.069
Because you wanted me to.

01:09:11.703 --> 01:09:15.075
I don't. Do you hear me?!
I don't!

01:09:17.477 --> 01:09:23.584
I want you back here behind the
glass, back where you belong.

01:09:26.185 --> 01:09:30.656
I want out. I want out!

01:09:38.197 --> 01:09:41.564
Did you really want me to
risk our lives to save hers? Hm?

01:09:41.567 --> 01:09:44.836
Save? You pushed her to it.

01:09:44.837 --> 01:09:47.774
I didn't touch her.

01:09:49.741 --> 01:09:52.777
That's right, accidents happen.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:55.479
She brought this on herself.

01:09:55.481 --> 01:09:57.849
I didn't want this to happen.

01:09:57.851 --> 01:09:59.684
Can you look at me
and sincerely say...

01:09:59.686 --> 01:10:02.723
you want her back in your life?

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:08.059
Good. There are no lies
between us.

01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:11.229
Remember, I'm doing all
of this for you.

01:10:11.231 --> 01:10:12.800
For us.

01:10:15.101 --> 01:10:20.674
Wait. Who are you?

01:10:26.612 --> 01:10:28.548
You know me.

01:11:27.673 --> 01:11:29.942
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:11:41.353 --> 01:11:44.220
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:44.222 --> 01:11:46.657
Where are you going?

01:11:46.659 --> 01:11:49.693
Home. I really can't...

01:11:49.695 --> 01:11:51.831
Handle it?

01:11:53.799 --> 01:11:59.172
I'm sorry, I um, I didn't
mean to just leave like that.

01:12:00.373 --> 01:12:02.543
Hey.

01:12:06.044 --> 01:12:09.814
- We'll pull through, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:09.816 --> 01:12:13.786
We're in this together.
You know that, right?

01:13:22.722 --> 01:13:25.025
Something for the pain?

01:13:41.173 --> 01:13:43.810
I didn't know you smoked weed.

01:13:44.744 --> 01:13:46.780
I do now.

01:13:59.926 --> 01:14:03.394
I just can't believe she's gone.

01:14:03.396 --> 01:14:09.166
I keep waiting for her to come
back and tell me...

01:14:09.168 --> 01:14:11.836
it's all just some kind of sick
joke or something.

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:14.206
Stupid, isn't it?

01:14:16.275 --> 01:14:18.679
You're just sad, that's all.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:28.385
I know how that feels.

01:14:28.387 --> 01:14:31.924
Sometimes I think it's all
I know.

01:14:38.463 --> 01:14:39.932
Are you okay?

01:14:42.235 --> 01:14:45.005
Are you crying?

01:14:46.905 --> 01:14:50.908
I have a confession to make.

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.413
What?

01:15:00.852 --> 01:15:07.457
All of those times when I was
with you and Lily...

01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:16.966
I'd look at her and I'd just
think, what would it be like...

01:15:16.968 --> 01:15:22.907
if it were you touching my hair,
kissing my lips?

01:15:22.909 --> 01:15:27.981
And then, when I was
alone with myself...

01:15:30.148 --> 01:15:32.218
I'd touch myself...

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.956
and I'd imagine your hand
touching me all over.

01:15:38.958 --> 01:15:40.157
Stop.

01:15:40.159 --> 01:15:44.464
And I'd get so hot
thinking about it.

01:15:45.865 --> 01:15:47.834
Stop it.

01:15:50.203 --> 01:15:53.837
Maria... don't, it's wrong.

01:15:53.839 --> 01:15:54.971
Stop it.

01:15:54.973 --> 01:15:57.811
I can't stop now, Sean.

01:16:00.346 --> 01:16:02.281
Feel me.

01:17:06.678 --> 01:17:10.382
One special som tam salad.

01:17:14.387 --> 01:17:15.452
Mm.

01:17:15.454 --> 01:17:17.421
- You like?
- Mm-hm.

01:17:17.423 --> 01:17:20.056
Not many
Americans order this dish.

01:17:20.058 --> 01:17:21.658
They don't know what
they're missing.

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:23.594
Bon appétit.

01:17:23.596 --> 01:17:24.897
Thank you.

01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:31.568
It's good to see
you enjoy your food.

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:35.141
I'm enjoying everything now,
Daddy.

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:39.310
So, how are you feeling?

01:17:39.312 --> 01:17:42.145
I mean, after the accident.

01:17:42.147 --> 01:17:44.247
Oh, I'm good.

01:17:44.249 --> 01:17:47.184
- You're good?
- Mm-hm.

01:17:47.186 --> 01:17:49.619
It was only a couple days ago.

01:17:49.621 --> 01:17:55.591
- You two were so close.
- Not anymore.

01:17:55.593 --> 01:18:00.997
Daddy, are you ever coming
back home?

01:18:00.999 --> 01:18:06.403
It's complicated. Your mom and
I, um, we have problems.

01:18:06.405 --> 01:18:09.305
But it's nothing
you can't fix, right?

01:18:09.307 --> 01:18:14.677
That's what you do best,
fix things.

01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:18.284
Yeah... I try.

01:18:26.525 --> 01:18:28.094
Honey.

01:18:30.228 --> 01:18:32.365
Hey, clean yourself up.

01:18:35.133 --> 01:18:36.468
What are you doing?

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:40.272
Sit in your chair.

01:18:42.741 --> 01:18:45.445
Sit in your chair properly.

01:18:49.048 --> 01:18:50.417
Cheers.

01:19:00.226 --> 01:19:03.295
What do you see? Hm?

01:19:05.697 --> 01:19:10.266
You see a sophisticated,
young woman? Do you?

01:19:10.268 --> 01:19:13.403
A fiery, independent spirit?

01:19:13.405 --> 01:19:17.341
An adult? Is that what you see?

01:19:17.343 --> 01:19:19.743
'Cause I'll tell you what I see.

01:19:19.745 --> 01:19:26.019
I see a little girl trying way
too hard and looking pathetic.

01:19:28.187 --> 01:19:32.221
Now sit in your goddamn chair.

01:19:54.379 --> 01:19:56.680
So at the base of the well...

01:19:56.682 --> 01:19:59.649
Dante finds himself within
a large, frozen lake.

01:19:59.651 --> 01:20:03.119
It's Cocytus, the ninth circle
of hell.

01:20:03.121 --> 01:20:05.322
Entrapped in the ice, he finds
the sinners guilty...

01:20:05.324 --> 01:20:06.657
of treacheries against those...

01:20:06.659 --> 01:20:10.461
who with they had special
relationships.

01:20:10.463 --> 01:20:14.698
Now, as Ciardi writes, the
treacheries of these souls...

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:18.268
were denials of love and
of all human warmth.

01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:20.304
As they denied human ties...

01:20:20.306 --> 01:20:25.641
so were they bound by the
unyielding ice.

01:20:25.643 --> 01:20:33.117
All right, round one, Caina,
named after?

01:20:33.119 --> 01:20:35.152
Not everyone at once.

01:20:35.154 --> 01:20:38.822
It was Cain, surprise, surprise.

01:20:38.824 --> 01:20:41.824
And he killed his own brother
in the first act of murder...

01:20:41.826 --> 01:20:44.427
that's Genesis 4:8.

01:20:44.429 --> 01:20:46.662
Now this roundhouse is the
kindreds...

01:20:46.664 --> 01:20:49.233
to their to their treacheries.

01:20:49.235 --> 01:20:54.203
So they're allowed to have their
heads and necks above the ice...

01:20:54.205 --> 01:20:57.407
and they're allowed to bow just
to prevent themselves...

01:21:14.927 --> 01:21:18.628
Maria! Maria! Hey, Maria!

01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:21.564
Maria, get back, it's freezing.

01:21:29.374 --> 01:21:31.578
Get back in here. Are you crazy?

01:21:36.714 --> 01:21:39.248
Stop it, it's cold,
it's freezing.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.284
Oh shit!

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.302
Come on.

01:22:14.753 --> 01:22:15.885
Hi.

01:22:15.887 --> 01:22:18.889
School project, they let us
go early.

01:22:18.891 --> 01:22:22.391
Oh... hi, Sean.

01:22:22.393 --> 01:22:25.295
Hey, Mrs. Brennan.

01:22:25.297 --> 01:22:28.265
How are you holding up
these days?

01:22:28.267 --> 01:22:30.833
It must be so hard for you.

01:22:30.835 --> 01:22:35.338
Uh... it's not easy, but
we're helping each other.

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.974
Oh.

01:22:36.976 --> 01:22:40.246
And how exactly are you
doing that? By cutting school?

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.557
Go back to sleep, Mom.

01:23:05.303 --> 01:23:07.306
Harder.

01:23:10.276 --> 01:23:11.444
Harder.

01:23:57.722 --> 01:23:59.389
Hey, I've got an idea.

01:23:59.391 --> 01:24:02.326
Isn't it a little bit
early for one of your ideas?

01:24:02.328 --> 01:24:04.461
Let's cut school today.

01:24:04.463 --> 01:24:06.630
Again? I can't.

01:24:06.632 --> 01:24:09.533
I got a physics exam.

01:24:09.535 --> 01:24:12.469
Okay, what time is your exam?

01:24:12.471 --> 01:24:15.072
Fourth period.

01:24:15.074 --> 01:24:17.607
- No, no way.
- Mm-hm. Come on.

01:24:17.609 --> 01:24:20.446
There's so much we can
do in a couple of hours.

01:24:54.545 --> 01:24:56.481
Mm.

01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:00.917
Mom's bottomless liquor cabinet.

01:25:00.919 --> 01:25:03.656
You're just full of surprises,
baby.

01:25:13.565 --> 01:25:16.065
Hey, Mom?

01:25:16.067 --> 01:25:19.469
At school, where else?

01:25:19.471 --> 01:25:23.073
Wait. Who... who called?

01:25:23.075 --> 01:25:25.442
The police?

01:25:25.444 --> 01:25:28.412
Did she say why they
wanted to talk to me?

01:25:28.414 --> 01:25:32.649
No, I'm not with her.

01:25:32.651 --> 01:25:34.684
I don't know where she is.

01:25:34.686 --> 01:25:38.087
I... I didn't get a chance
to tell you about us.

01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:41.792
I'm sorry, I... look yeah,
it doesn't matter where I am.

01:25:41.794 --> 01:25:43.859
Okay, Mom? I'll get to them
right away.

01:25:43.861 --> 01:25:45.831
Okay. Bye.

01:25:50.502 --> 01:25:52.601
We gotta go.

01:25:52.603 --> 01:25:54.503
The police, they wanna talk
to me.

01:25:54.505 --> 01:25:56.473
They wanna talk to you, too.

01:25:56.475 --> 01:26:00.609
They found out that we've
been... anyway...

01:26:00.611 --> 01:26:02.612
they're waiting for us in the
principal's office, so...

01:26:02.614 --> 01:26:06.483
And what do you care?

01:26:06.485 --> 01:26:08.185
What?

01:26:08.187 --> 01:26:11.488
Well, you've got nothing
to tell the police.

01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:16.460
Yeah, but they don't know that.

01:26:16.462 --> 01:26:19.229
It's the police, Maria.
We... we gotta go.

01:26:19.231 --> 01:26:23.102
We don't wanna get into trouble.
I'm going to college next year.

01:26:25.904 --> 01:26:27.636
I'm not going to the police.

01:26:27.638 --> 01:26:28.939
What... what are you talking
about?

01:26:28.941 --> 01:26:31.640
We... we gotta help them out.

01:26:31.642 --> 01:26:34.644
Let... let's do it for Lily.

01:26:34.646 --> 01:26:37.083
She's dead, Sean.

01:26:39.084 --> 01:26:41.721
You don't still care about her,
do you?

01:26:45.089 --> 01:26:47.526
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:26:53.598 --> 01:26:55.700
Oh, Sean.

01:27:00.505 --> 01:27:07.446
She didn't care about you,
not like I do.

01:27:11.282 --> 01:27:14.620
Stay with me.

01:27:20.258 --> 01:27:21.625
Stay with me.

01:27:21.627 --> 01:27:25.228
- Wait, Maria, stop.
- Stay with me.

01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:26.930
Please stop.

01:27:26.932 --> 01:27:28.935
- Stop. Stop!
- Agh!

01:27:36.607 --> 01:27:38.844
Why are you avoiding the cops?

01:27:44.816 --> 01:27:46.953
What aren't you telling me?

01:29:33.691 --> 01:29:35.658
There's no point.

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:37.362
No point in what?

01:29:39.697 --> 01:29:41.064
Can I hold our baby?

01:29:41.066 --> 01:29:42.431
Honey, listen to me.

01:29:42.433 --> 01:29:46.802
I have seen her,
it's better this way.

01:29:46.804 --> 01:29:51.006
We could love her. Just why
can't we just love her?

01:29:51.008 --> 01:29:56.746
She's deformed, Amy,
there's no point.

01:29:56.748 --> 01:29:59.852
No point in what?

01:31:13.892 --> 01:31:16.458
Maria? Hey.

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.862
- Daddy.
- Jesus.

01:31:18.864 --> 01:31:20.430
I'm not feeling well.

01:31:20.432 --> 01:31:23.299
- What's going on?
- I think I drank too much.

01:31:23.301 --> 01:31:26.935
Aw, Christ, who gave you
alcohol?

01:31:26.937 --> 01:31:28.337
I don't remember.

01:31:28.339 --> 01:31:30.372
- Where were you?
- Don't remember.

01:31:30.374 --> 01:31:35.080
- Can you help me, Daddy?
- Yeah. Okay.

01:31:37.115 --> 01:31:41.786
All right, stay there.

01:31:56.133 --> 01:32:00.537
Okay... here, here's
a come on, come on.

01:32:00.539 --> 01:32:04.073
- Here, here, here, drink that.
- Daddy.

01:32:04.075 --> 01:32:05.542
- Drink it.
- Dad.

01:32:05.544 --> 01:32:09.112
Drink. All right, drink it all.

01:32:09.114 --> 01:32:11.314
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:32:11.316 --> 01:32:14.754
Why are you always such a mess?

01:32:25.963 --> 01:32:28.030
Jesus.

01:32:28.032 --> 01:32:30.268
Maria, put your shirt on,
please.

01:32:33.038 --> 01:32:38.009
Maria! I'm not messing around.
I want your clothes on now!

01:32:40.145 --> 01:32:41.847
Put 'em on!

01:32:46.084 --> 01:32:49.421
What are you doing? Jesus.
Do you think this...

01:32:51.388 --> 01:32:53.256
You think that's sh...
shocking me?

01:32:53.258 --> 01:32:54.960
You think I don't see bodies
all day long?

01:32:57.027 --> 01:32:58.894
It's not right, you're not well.

01:32:58.896 --> 01:33:03.198
Maria... stop it. Whatever it
is, stop it now.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.871
- Do you think I'm beautiful?
- What?

01:33:07.873 --> 01:33:10.006
Do you think I'm beautiful?

01:33:10.008 --> 01:33:12.908
Of course, you are, now get
dressed.

01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:19.148
Just, whatever is happening, I
want you to stop it now, Maria.

01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:21.984
- Would you love me if I wasn't?
- What?

01:33:21.986 --> 01:33:25.988
Would you love me if I wasn't
beautiful?

01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:31.461
- If I was deformed?
- What?

01:33:31.463 --> 01:33:34.099
- Why would you say that?
- Would you?

01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:44.006
Just put that on, please,
I'm asking nicely, please.

01:33:44.008 --> 01:33:46.145
Put this on, okay?

01:33:47.978 --> 01:33:50.215
Put it on!

01:33:51.249 --> 01:33:54.917
Please, put it on.

01:33:54.919 --> 01:33:57.188
Look at me, Daddy.

01:34:01.092 --> 01:34:04.426
All right.

01:34:04.428 --> 01:34:06.065
See me.

01:34:19.009 --> 01:34:23.114
Yes. Yes, I would.

01:34:28.053 --> 01:34:30.022
Okay?

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.003
Why couldn't you love me?

01:35:25.543 --> 01:35:28.513
Why couldn't you just love me?

01:36:01.212 --> 01:36:03.315
Maria?

01:36:13.458 --> 01:36:15.361
Maria?

01:36:21.066 --> 01:36:23.232
Maria?

01:37:10.781 --> 01:37:13.084
Oh, shit.
