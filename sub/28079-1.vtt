01:25.860 --> 01:27.425
Oh my God.

01:27.427 --> 01:29.529
It was a... Argh!

02:36.762 --> 02:38.762
Ah, ah!

02:53.045 --> 02:54.510
Help me!

02:54.512 --> 02:56.547
Somebody, please... Help!

03:09.627 --> 03:11.594
Please...

03:11.596 --> 03:12.530
Please.

03:20.004 --> 03:21.606
Oh, no...

03:23.674 --> 03:24.541
Please.

03:28.511 --> 03:30.882
No, no, no, please! Please!

05:17.652 --> 05:19.153
Happy birthday, buddy!

05:21.923 --> 05:24.857
- You forgot your birthday again, didn't you?
- I guess I did.

05:24.859 --> 05:26.325
Happy birthday, Carlos.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.662
I'm worried about you.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.836
Cheers! For Carlos!

05:36.838 --> 05:38.873
- Thank you, guys!
- The guy that will always be older than me.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.641
Ugh!

05:43.810 --> 05:45.846
So you, uh...
You finished this yet?

05:46.780 --> 05:47.881
Not even close.

05:49.117 --> 05:50.584
Productive night then, huh?

05:51.285 --> 05:53.053
Something like that, yeah.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.057
Hey why don't you, uh... get away
a couple of days? Clear your head.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.927
Yeah I should
probably do it, right?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.164
"Hemingway's Cuba".

06:05.098 --> 06:07.832
Theme's pretty self-explanatory.
What's the problem?

06:07.834 --> 06:09.269
I don't know...
The problem is...

06:10.804 --> 06:12.804
You know, in my head...

06:12.806 --> 06:17.210
I have, sorry, everything I want to
say but... I don't know how to say it.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.577
Enlighten us.

06:20.579 --> 06:25.016
It's obviously about Hemingway
and his life and work in Cuba.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.018
Which is your area
of focus, right?

06:27.020 --> 06:30.854
I don't know, I'm missing
something, you know? I'm just...

06:30.856 --> 06:33.358
I'm trying to find a hook
to hang everything on.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.692
Why don't you just
write something else?

06:35.694 --> 06:37.295
John!

06:37.297 --> 06:40.800
John! No... This is what I want to do.
I've been working on this for a while.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.602
I don't know, I just...

06:45.137 --> 06:47.037
I've been thinking about

06:47.039 --> 06:49.206
going to Cuba and spend
some time there.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.009
Why don't you?

06:51.677 --> 06:54.344
Yeah. I should
probably do it, right?

06:54.346 --> 06:57.081
I would love to go
to Cuba someday.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.349
Really? You never told me that.

06:59.351 --> 07:00.585
You never asked.

07:01.887 --> 07:04.154
Is your bathroom safe to use?

07:04.156 --> 07:05.857
It's the cleanest room
in this apartment.

07:10.162 --> 07:11.097
Check it out.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.201
Oh so you were
serious about this?

07:16.868 --> 07:19.001
Of course I'm serious about it.
We've been dating forever.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.970
Well, congratulations!

07:20.972 --> 07:23.706
Don't pop the cork on the champagne
bottle just yet. She hasn't said yes.

07:23.708 --> 07:27.276
But she will. Everybody knows that
she likes you, she's in love with you.

07:27.278 --> 07:28.680
- You think?
- Yeah.

07:30.248 --> 07:31.282
Come on.

07:34.819 --> 07:36.087
What's going on here?

07:41.692 --> 07:43.025
So what's the plan?

07:43.027 --> 07:43.960
Plan for what?

07:43.962 --> 07:46.229
Your birthday, dumbass!
What are we doing?

07:46.231 --> 07:48.830
I don't know. Drinks, I guess.

07:48.832 --> 07:51.000
"Drinksh it ish."

07:51.002 --> 07:52.268
What time?

07:52.270 --> 07:53.737
You guys what us to do seven?

07:54.872 --> 07:57.273
So we'll see you
at seven at Veryl?

07:57.275 --> 07:58.307
Veryl is fine.

07:58.309 --> 08:00.409
Seven at Veryl. Hey!

08:00.411 --> 08:02.345
- Don't be late!
- Never late!

08:02.347 --> 08:03.945
- Don't be late!
- I won't!

08:03.947 --> 08:05.983
- Promise you won't be late!
- I promise!

08:29.940 --> 08:31.141
Can I help you?

08:32.208 --> 08:34.875
Yeah. Uh, I'm
looking for Joshua.

08:34.876 --> 08:37.080
He's on vacation
for a couple of weeks.

08:39.081 --> 08:42.082
Really? He didn't mention
anything to me.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.451
And you are?

08:43.453 --> 08:47.755
I'm Carlos Carrasco. I'm Joshua's friend.
Come here all the time.

08:47.757 --> 08:49.759
Oh, yes. Carlos.

08:50.527 --> 08:52.092
We've never met.

08:52.094 --> 08:54.195
Joshua did mention you though.

08:54.197 --> 08:56.764
- Frank.
- Pleasure to meet you.

08:56.766 --> 08:59.033
Joshua asked me
to look after his place

08:59.035 --> 09:02.036
while he's out of town attending
some personal business.

09:02.038 --> 09:03.470
Nothing serious I hope.

09:03.472 --> 09:06.974
Mmm... I'm not entirely
sure of the details myself.

09:06.976 --> 09:10.177
He did, however, say that
you would be stopping by.

09:10.179 --> 09:11.345
- He did?
- Mm-hm.

09:11.347 --> 09:13.249
In fact he left
something for you.

09:14.317 --> 09:15.784
Please, follow me.

09:16.851 --> 09:17.719
<i>Por favor.</i>

09:20.489 --> 09:24.924
Joshua mentioned you are working on an essay.
Something to do with Ernest Hemingway, right?

09:24.926 --> 09:25.959
Yeah.

09:25.961 --> 09:28.997
Well, he thinks this might
be of benefit to you.

09:34.570 --> 09:37.837
- <i>Â¿Havana Darkness?</i>
- Mm-hm.

09:37.839 --> 09:39.874
- What is this?
- Look for yourself.

09:43.078 --> 09:44.844
It's in Spanish.

09:44.846 --> 09:47.347
Most of phrasing and
wording is very disjointed.

09:47.349 --> 09:50.016
Huh. My very same impression.

09:50.018 --> 09:51.117
Who's the author?

09:51.119 --> 09:54.254
Anonymous. But this
is where it gets interesting.

09:54.256 --> 09:57.590
Joshua spoke to some guy from an
auction where he picked this up.

09:57.592 --> 10:02.230
He was told that this belonged to
his great uncle, Antonio Gattorno.

10:03.897 --> 10:07.032
- Antonio Gattorno.
- Mm-hm.

10:07.034 --> 10:09.337
The manuscript came
with a collection of letters.

10:10.538 --> 10:11.038
Here.

10:12.474 --> 10:13.907
Recognize the signature?

10:16.210 --> 10:17.044
Yeah.

10:17.978 --> 10:19.480
- That's...
- Hemingway?

10:21.482 --> 10:22.516
Who knows.

10:41.035 --> 10:45.439
Antonio Gattorno was a Cuban artist
and a very close friend of Hemingway.

10:46.473 --> 10:50.043
He actually moved to New York and spent
over twenty years living in this city.

10:50.977 --> 10:53.645
Joshua said that this manuscript
was part of a stack of books

10:53.647 --> 10:56.448
that were brought here
from Cuba in the eighties.

10:56.450 --> 11:01.520
We strongly believe that this book was
one of Hemingway's lost manuscripts.

11:01.522 --> 11:05.892
At least part of it anyway because
it appears to be unfinished. See?

11:07.126 --> 11:10.029
"For him this place
led to darkness...

11:11.030 --> 11:12.532
which led to pain...

11:14.200 --> 11:15.535
then to horror...

11:17.036 --> 11:20.306
horror so unspeakable
that hung on him forever."

11:21.341 --> 11:23.142
Please, take it.

11:24.677 --> 11:26.143
No!

11:26.145 --> 11:27.611
No, I can't!

11:27.613 --> 11:31.315
I mean... If this is what you say
it is it must be worth a fortune.

11:31.317 --> 11:34.685
As a matter of fact Joshua said that you
might be interested in helping us with that.

11:34.687 --> 11:37.390
Absolutely! Yeah,
of course, but...

11:38.424 --> 11:41.492
but I cannot take it with me.

11:41.494 --> 11:43.095
He insisted you take it.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.528
You sure?

11:45.530 --> 11:48.198
I'm sure. Actually I'm certain.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.068
Joshua will be back
in a couple of weeks.

11:50.969 --> 11:53.036
I promise I'll take
care of this, okay?

11:53.038 --> 11:55.405
If you talk to Joshua please
tell him that I said thank you.

11:55.407 --> 11:57.075
I'll be sure to tell him that.

12:48.759 --> 12:52.128
"He stood across the street
from that building in Havana.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.066
The place was pure...

12:59.068 --> 13:00.469
evil.

13:00.471 --> 13:01.505
Nothing else.

13:03.373 --> 13:04.542
There was some..."

13:39.309 --> 13:40.608
- What's up?
- <i>What's up?!</i>

13:40.610 --> 13:43.210
<i>It's eight fifteen and you are
not here, that's what's up.</i>

13:43.212 --> 13:45.615
Just give me twenty
minutes, I'll be there.

13:51.086 --> 13:53.821
"Oh well, cash in their checks"
and pays in freshman.

13:53.823 --> 13:55.756
What did he do?

13:55.758 --> 13:57.224
He took a swing!

13:57.226 --> 13:59.593
Why am I not surprised.

13:59.595 --> 14:00.696
Whose side are you on?

14:03.765 --> 14:06.433
So? How's your essay
coming along?

14:06.435 --> 14:09.302
Good. Good. Actually, uh...

14:09.304 --> 14:12.341
Something came up today
that might help a lot.

14:13.742 --> 14:15.308
Your table is ready.

14:15.310 --> 14:19.713
You guys remember Joshua, right? The
guy who owns a bookstore. 83rd and York.

14:19.715 --> 14:20.847
Yeah, yeah, the
sweet little thing.

14:20.849 --> 14:23.650
Yeah the guy who wants to get
in your pants, that one?

14:23.652 --> 14:25.017
- He's not!
- Anyway, listen.

14:25.019 --> 14:28.622
This guy, he just recently acquired
a lot of stuff at an auction.

14:28.624 --> 14:33.492
And one of those things is this old
book, it's a handwritten manuscript

14:33.494 --> 14:37.498
and they believe it may
have been written by

14:38.466 --> 14:39.698
Hemingway.

14:39.700 --> 14:40.769
- No!
- Yes!

14:41.803 --> 14:43.571
- It's amazing!
- Aha.

14:44.605 --> 14:45.871
And?

14:45.873 --> 14:50.376
What do you mean, "and"? This
is a big deal, don't you see it?

14:50.378 --> 14:52.747
Hemingway wrote a lot of things
that went missing over the years.

14:54.649 --> 14:56.382
Especially when he
was living in Cuba.

14:56.384 --> 15:00.553
So these guys believe that
this is one of those pieces.

15:00.555 --> 15:03.889
So how do you know this is an
original manuscript though?

15:03.891 --> 15:06.525
That's exactly what I'm trying to
learn right now. I'm working on that.

15:06.527 --> 15:11.630
But if I can... if I can prove it is
then I have a foundation for my work.

15:11.632 --> 15:15.567
"Unlocking the mystery
behind Hemingway"

15:15.569 --> 15:20.572
or "Unlocking the mystery
behind Hemingway's work".

15:20.574 --> 15:21.774
Oh.

15:21.776 --> 15:22.875
- It has a good ring to it.
- No? Well it's a working title.

15:22.877 --> 15:25.143
- It's a working title you know.
- It's super catchy.

15:25.145 --> 15:27.178
Yeah I mean just... read it.

15:27.180 --> 15:29.514
I would go and spend some time in
Cuba but there's no way to be certain.

15:29.516 --> 15:30.848
What I've been
telling you.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.185
Why don't we go?

15:33.453 --> 15:34.621
Why don't we go to Cuba?

15:35.622 --> 15:37.221
This weekend.
Why don't we go?

15:37.223 --> 15:38.790
Okay, you've had one too many.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.293
- Go together?
- Yeah.

15:41.528 --> 15:42.894
Just up and go?

15:42.896 --> 15:47.230
Yeah. Hey. I don't work this weekend.
You don't work this weekend.

15:47.232 --> 15:49.234
Look. I'm gonna get
us a round of shots.

15:50.369 --> 15:53.439
But if you decide to
go to Cuba I might be in.

15:54.406 --> 15:56.608
It's not gonna be a hindrance
to your research, right?

15:56.610 --> 15:58.143
No, no, I...

15:59.545 --> 16:01.411
Help me out, man!

16:01.413 --> 16:03.447
- See me looking at you?
- Yeah, but...

16:03.449 --> 16:06.151
It is a perfect opportunity
to give her the ring.

16:07.419 --> 16:08.518
Right.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.720
Yeah.

16:09.722 --> 16:11.922
- And then are you with me?
- Yeah. Of course. It's great.

16:11.924 --> 16:12.856
Okay.

16:12.858 --> 16:14.858
Well. Let's go to Cuba.

16:14.860 --> 16:16.395
Yeah, let's go to Cuba.

16:17.896 --> 16:20.364
So, what's the verdict?

16:20.366 --> 16:21.533
Carlos, what's the verdict?

16:22.601 --> 16:23.569
To Cuba!

16:24.670 --> 16:25.638
Cuba!

16:51.863 --> 16:52.630
Let's go.

17:20.490 --> 17:21.491
So this is it.

17:22.894 --> 17:23.861
Awesome.

17:26.931 --> 17:29.999
Carlos, is this uh... is this where
you grew up? Is this the neighborhood?

17:30.001 --> 17:31.633
No. No.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.768
Not too far away
from here though.

17:33.770 --> 17:34.905
Can I go unpack?

18:10.439 --> 18:12.708
Hey do you have, uh...
Do you have the Wi-Fi code?

18:13.977 --> 18:16.312
I told you. There is
no connectivity here.

18:17.446 --> 18:18.846
Don't worry.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.484
At certain point I'm gonna have
to go and find some place as well.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.486
I don't feel like I properly
prepared for this trip.

18:25.488 --> 18:27.323
So, uh, what's the plan?

18:28.424 --> 18:29.990
Well,

18:29.992 --> 18:33.362
I was planning to go and visit one of
the places where Hemingway stayed at.

18:34.563 --> 18:35.662
You guys wanna come?

18:35.664 --> 18:37.396
Nah I'm gonna pass.

18:37.398 --> 18:40.768
I've been thinking more
rum, cigars, you know.

18:40.770 --> 18:41.604
Okay.

18:42.838 --> 18:44.272
I wanna come.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.845
It sounds like a great...

18:50.745 --> 18:51.845
great plan.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.849
- Sure.
- Hey, you can smoke your cigars tonight.

18:56.651 --> 18:57.585
Leaving in five.

19:41.129 --> 19:42.863
We should go in there later.

19:59.780 --> 20:01.782
- What?
- This is my house.

20:10.023 --> 20:11.390
Twenty dollars.

20:55.167 --> 20:57.600
Hey where did you go?
You disappeared on us.

20:57.602 --> 21:00.503
I was just looking around
trying to find something.

21:00.505 --> 21:01.906
Did you?

21:01.908 --> 21:03.107
I think so.

21:03.109 --> 21:03.909
Look!

21:07.946 --> 21:09.612
Cool.

21:09.614 --> 21:10.916
You know what that means?

21:15.987 --> 21:17.053
You about ready?

21:17.055 --> 21:17.822
What?

21:18.890 --> 21:20.857
Ready for what?

21:20.859 --> 21:23.092
To go out. Karen's almost ready.

21:23.094 --> 21:26.529
No, no. I can't
go out right now.

21:26.531 --> 21:28.164
I need to find a place
with the internet.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.767
The hell you can't! I went to
the Hemingway thing for you!

21:30.769 --> 21:32.534
The least you could
do is go out with us!

21:32.536 --> 21:35.138
I really need to get a jump
on this as soon as possible.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.574
No, what you need
to do is relax.

21:38.676 --> 21:39.945
You need a drink.

21:43.081 --> 21:46.215
Can't you find a stopping
spot or something, man?

21:46.217 --> 21:47.383
We are going to your
favorite restaurant.

21:47.385 --> 21:51.622
Good. Good. It's a really
cool place. You'll like it.

21:56.026 --> 21:57.893
Um...

21:57.895 --> 21:58.929
So...

22:00.531 --> 22:02.264
Is tonight gonna be the night?

22:02.266 --> 22:07.769
No. I don't... This doesn't feel right and
the date's off. You know, it's cloudy out.

22:07.771 --> 22:08.973
Hey, guys. You ready?

22:10.140 --> 22:11.640
You coming with us, Carlos?

22:11.642 --> 22:13.241
No, no.

22:13.243 --> 22:16.912
You know. As you can see I have a couple
of things for the time right now, so.

22:16.914 --> 22:19.883
You know, even Hemingway used to
take breaks and drink sometimes.

22:20.818 --> 22:22.585
You should listen
to her. She's smart.

22:24.687 --> 22:25.722
Come on. Let's go.

22:45.775 --> 22:47.210
Hey, hey! Speak English?

28:05.587 --> 28:08.188
You haven't said a word
about my new Cuban look, man.

28:08.190 --> 28:10.157
- Oh that's a Cuban look right there?
- Yeah.

28:10.159 --> 28:11.591
Hah.

28:11.593 --> 28:12.659
- I got it off the street.
- You are actually worried about that look?

28:12.661 --> 28:13.593
- No.
- Yes.

28:13.595 --> 28:15.161
- It is legit Cuban gear.
- Ha, seriously?

28:15.163 --> 28:19.131
Sure, we got gypped, fine. And he's
embarrassing me on the streets of Havana.

28:19.133 --> 28:20.933
I've seen these pants everywhere,
everyone is wearing them.

28:20.935 --> 28:22.935
Everywhere in Havana.
Yeah, of course.

28:22.937 --> 28:26.005
Carlos, I think you need to take
us on a tour of your... city.

28:26.007 --> 28:29.275
I wish I could, but you guys have
to understand I'm working here.

28:29.277 --> 28:30.976
That's the main reason
why I came here, to work.

28:30.978 --> 28:32.345
As you can see
he's here to work.

28:32.347 --> 28:36.315
Yeah, believe it or not I'm finding
great things along the process.

28:36.317 --> 28:37.550
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:37.552 --> 28:38.684
Tell us about it.

28:38.686 --> 28:41.187
Well... You know, I mean...

28:41.189 --> 28:42.957
I don't know, important
things like...

28:45.393 --> 28:48.960
I don't want you guys
to think I'm getting nuts.

28:48.962 --> 28:51.029
Oh, we know you are nuts.
You can just go on.

28:51.031 --> 28:52.200
It's a little late for that.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.136
I found this section
of the book I have.

28:57.237 --> 28:58.439
It is description

28:59.474 --> 29:01.442
about a place, a house.

29:02.376 --> 29:03.377
Abandoned house.

29:04.645 --> 29:08.012
Apparently that place was
shut down by the '58th

29:08.014 --> 29:10.649
when the police found five
bodies in the basement.

29:10.651 --> 29:12.452
Now, Hemingway was here

29:13.453 --> 29:16.688
and I believe he was looking
very closely into this

29:16.690 --> 29:19.292
because he was doing some
research for a book or something.

29:21.495 --> 29:23.263
The manuscript I have

29:24.398 --> 29:26.233
is a sort of diary

29:27.200 --> 29:29.969
that he was using
to keep track in this case.

29:31.304 --> 29:34.004
If I can prove this...

29:34.006 --> 29:37.442
This... This is perf.
I can get this published.

29:37.444 --> 29:38.445
You got my attention.

29:39.379 --> 29:40.578
Sounds good!

29:40.580 --> 29:42.480
So what happened
to the dead bodies?

29:42.482 --> 29:44.281
They were mutilated.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.284
Nice.

29:45.652 --> 29:48.220
Right. For the story of course.

29:49.589 --> 29:50.489
Yeah.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.293
So there's only
one last thing to do.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.328
You may go to the house
and check it out.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.397
As a matter of fact it is
very close to our place.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.565
Perfect.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.667
- Close? How close?
- Mm-hm.

30:03.669 --> 30:04.703
Blocks away.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.038
We have no excuse.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.006
That's why we didn't
stay at the hotel.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.342
So this guy could
go to the house.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.480
Sneaky, sneaky Carlos.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.278
- What are you doing, weirdo?
- Shh!

31:22.212 --> 31:24.648
- Hold on, let me turn the light on.
- No, no, don't, don't!

31:26.583 --> 31:28.719
Just
come over here. Come.

31:38.428 --> 31:39.663
What are you staring at?

31:42.566 --> 31:44.033
You see that guy?

31:47.270 --> 31:48.237
He's gone.

31:51.742 --> 31:53.440
You guys, what are you doing?

31:53.442 --> 31:55.511
Honey, go back to bed.
I'll be right there.

31:57.614 --> 31:59.115
Great. Get some sleep.

32:02.418 --> 32:04.218
He's gone.

32:04.220 --> 32:05.254
Alright?

33:13.755 --> 33:14.789
Will you...

33:15.924 --> 33:17.124
Will you marry me?

33:22.964 --> 33:24.632
- Is that a yes?
- It's yes.

34:26.926 --> 34:29.827
Carlos! We have cause
for celebration!

34:29.829 --> 34:31.395
Just got engaged!

34:31.397 --> 34:33.797
- Nothing? Really?
- Carlos?

34:33.800 --> 34:34.734
Did you hear me?

34:35.868 --> 34:36.734
- I don't feel that you're grasping...
- Look!

34:36.735 --> 34:38.905
...the full magnitude
of this moment.

34:39.906 --> 34:41.574
You have to see something.

34:43.676 --> 34:44.811
What do you got?

34:47.312 --> 34:48.846
Just look.

34:48.848 --> 34:51.681
Oh, it's all starting
to make sense now.

34:51.683 --> 34:53.349
Who is she?

34:53.351 --> 34:55.052
Alright, where did you get it?

34:55.054 --> 34:58.022
Someone just slided
it under the door.

34:58.024 --> 35:00.657
- Probably a mistake. It's a neighbor or something.
- No, Karen. Karen.

35:00.659 --> 35:01.793
It's not a mistake.

35:03.729 --> 35:05.797
See that handwriter?
You see it?

35:09.468 --> 35:10.734
It's the same.

35:10.736 --> 35:12.234
Okay.

35:12.236 --> 35:15.472
Nice. Progress, right? Now we got two
reasons to celebrate. Now, can we go?

35:15.474 --> 35:17.442
No, we're not
celebrating anything.

35:18.409 --> 35:19.809
There's no reason to ce...

35:19.811 --> 35:21.711
Don't you see what's
happening here?

35:21.713 --> 35:22.413
Really?

35:23.481 --> 35:25.414
You cannot see it?

35:25.416 --> 35:27.449
They know what I'm
doing, this is a statement.

35:27.451 --> 35:29.819
They're trying to tell me something.
Like that guy from yesterday,

35:29.821 --> 35:31.720
he was standing right there.
You saw him.

35:31.722 --> 35:33.957
For an hour looking at
me, is that normal to you?

35:33.959 --> 35:35.424
Hey, what guy?

35:35.426 --> 35:38.962
It was some weirdo
watching Carlos. I don't know.

35:38.964 --> 35:41.764
Look, it's Cuba, man.
It's... It's to be expected.

35:41.766 --> 35:45.000
Like somebody is watching me all the time.
I'm being surveyed all the time.

35:45.002 --> 35:46.769
Somebody's after
me, I can feel it.

35:46.771 --> 35:50.739
- Okay, you are starting to sound a little paranoid, Carlos.
- No, it's not paranoid. Look!

35:50.741 --> 35:52.810
Calm down, man! Fuck!

35:54.578 --> 35:56.345
I'm sorry.

35:56.347 --> 35:57.646
Whatever.

35:57.648 --> 35:58.582
Crazy.

36:01.652 --> 36:02.887
Dude, what the fuck?

36:05.022 --> 36:06.389
I'm sorry.

36:08.391 --> 36:10.527
You know what? You
know I love you but...

36:13.563 --> 36:14.965
Get your shit together, man.

37:00.709 --> 37:03.743
Maybe we can row on these
little boats, super cheap.

37:03.745 --> 37:05.046
Oh, probably not.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.115
Take a look at that.

37:10.752 --> 37:12.018
What do you...
What do you want...?

37:12.020 --> 37:15.722
The number in the building. It
matches for the one at pictures.

37:15.724 --> 37:17.524
So what, man? What...

37:17.526 --> 37:20.060
You gotta be kidding me.
I'm so done with this.

37:20.062 --> 37:24.598
The same house. Same number. Same building.
Same street. Same everything. Don't you see it?

37:24.600 --> 37:27.435
That woman, whoever she is,
she came here because of that.

37:28.770 --> 37:30.604
Can't you just let it
go, brother? Just...

37:30.606 --> 37:32.739
What do you mean
let it go, John?

37:32.741 --> 37:35.041
John, I wanna go home.

37:35.043 --> 37:36.609
Baby, please.
Just come sit down.

37:36.611 --> 37:38.379
No, I said I wanna
go home right now.

37:40.048 --> 37:43.883
I wanna celebrate and Carlos has been
acting crazy since he got here so we can't.

37:43.885 --> 37:45.684
So let's get the
fuck out of here.

37:45.686 --> 37:50.990
Listen, I'm sorry to bother you with all this,
but seriously there's something behind this.

37:50.992 --> 37:53.594
I can feel it... I mean
this is not normal.

37:54.495 --> 37:57.129
If you're so worried about her why
don't you just go to the police?

37:57.131 --> 38:00.532
What am I gonna tell them?
They're not gonna listen to me.

38:00.534 --> 38:02.234
Right now I don't wanna
fucking listen to you.

38:02.236 --> 38:05.804
Well, just... Just help
me in, that's all.

38:05.806 --> 38:07.172
Help you in where?!

38:07.174 --> 38:09.909
I need to get into that building.
I need to see what's inside.

38:09.911 --> 38:11.744
Alright, John.

38:11.746 --> 38:15.080
If Carlos wants to go into that building we're
gonna go into the building to see what's inside.

38:15.082 --> 38:15.983
Let's go.

38:16.884 --> 38:17.785
Now.

38:47.881 --> 38:49.747
How are we gonna get in?

38:49.749 --> 38:51.818
I already tried the
door. It's locked.

39:05.198 --> 39:06.565
Told you I tried.

39:11.004 --> 39:12.738
Thought you said
this was locked.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.541
It was locked.

39:17.076 --> 39:19.011
Hello? Hello?

39:21.213 --> 39:23.916
It's not bad, you know.
It needs a little paint.

39:24.850 --> 39:25.818
Little touch-up.

39:30.723 --> 39:32.558
It's real. It's real marble.

39:33.792 --> 39:34.827
Very nice.

39:47.306 --> 39:49.707
Let us see what's up here.

40:23.341 --> 40:24.907
Carlos?

40:24.909 --> 40:25.877
I'm here.

40:41.825 --> 40:43.858
What's that?

40:43.860 --> 40:45.296
I have no idea.

40:52.903 --> 40:53.670
Fuck!

40:55.105 --> 40:56.106
Come on!

40:59.810 --> 41:01.676
Hello!

41:01.678 --> 41:02.645
Hello!

41:06.883 --> 41:07.716
Hello!

41:08.919 --> 41:10.353
Can anyone hear us?

41:19.196 --> 41:20.994
There has to
be another exit.

41:20.996 --> 41:23.664
Did you boy Ernest say anything
about these doors lock up, huh?

41:23.666 --> 41:24.967
Is that in the manuscript?

41:33.109 --> 41:34.243
What is this?

41:38.781 --> 41:39.849
Just great.

41:43.052 --> 41:45.221
"There is no hunting

41:47.056 --> 41:49.724
like the hunting of man.

41:50.926 --> 41:54.762
And those who have hunted..."

41:55.864 --> 41:58.232
It's a quote from Hemingway.

41:58.234 --> 41:59.799
Oh, really?

41:59.801 --> 42:00.869
What does it mean?

42:02.338 --> 42:04.471
- What paint...
- Wait.

42:04.473 --> 42:06.174
Wait, don't touch that.

42:07.876 --> 42:09.911
"...for anything else."

42:12.814 --> 42:14.048
Of course. Alright.

42:17.418 --> 42:18.720
Worth a shot.

42:19.420 --> 42:20.989
How are we gonna
get out of here?

42:22.056 --> 42:24.724
There has to be
an exit somewhere.

42:24.726 --> 42:26.792
That would be great...
I'm about done with this...

42:34.335 --> 42:35.702
What is this?

42:41.476 --> 42:42.809
What...

42:50.518 --> 42:52.152
Where are we going, Carlos?

42:53.287 --> 42:55.421
We're going down the hallway.

42:55.423 --> 42:56.823
Are you crazy?

43:03.163 --> 43:07.267
Looks to me like...
we need to follow the lights.

43:15.042 --> 43:17.808
We don't know who's
turning on these lights.

43:17.810 --> 43:20.278
I think we should go find him.
Think he's out there.

43:20.280 --> 43:23.481
There's no exit out
there. There is no exit.

43:23.483 --> 43:25.783
We need to just go through
the hallway and find an exit.

43:25.785 --> 43:27.785
Carlos, I'm not going
anywhere with you.

43:27.787 --> 43:29.887
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit.
You got us into this...

43:29.889 --> 43:32.459
- Listen, I didn't ask you to...
- Guys, that's enough. Focus.

44:16.402 --> 44:17.302
Wait.

44:19.337 --> 44:20.937
It halts.

44:20.939 --> 44:23.174
- What's wrong?
- It stopped working...

44:57.141 --> 44:59.141
That one.

44:59.143 --> 45:00.077
I don't know.

45:22.299 --> 45:24.366
I'm gonna go inside,
just take a look.

45:24.368 --> 45:25.235
Okay.

45:26.470 --> 45:30.274
I'll just go and see first.

45:37.614 --> 45:39.614
- Clear?
- It's clear.

45:39.616 --> 45:40.617
It's clear.

45:58.434 --> 45:59.635
What is this place?

46:02.238 --> 46:03.406
Baby, I don't know.

46:07.943 --> 46:11.412
Come on! Carlos! Carlos!

46:11.414 --> 46:13.147
Carlos!

46:13.149 --> 46:14.948
Help!

46:14.950 --> 46:16.352
- Help!
- Carlos!

46:17.653 --> 46:19.387
Hey, John.

46:19.389 --> 46:21.254
- Help!
- John...

46:21.256 --> 46:22.358
Hey! Karen!

46:25.495 --> 46:27.160
Carlos!

46:27.162 --> 46:28.395
Babe!

46:28.397 --> 46:29.364
Babe!

46:34.136 --> 46:35.669
What's...

46:35.671 --> 46:37.005
What's going on, guys?

46:44.513 --> 46:46.047
Fuck! Fuck!

46:52.687 --> 46:53.688
<i>Welcome!</i>

46:54.856 --> 46:58.660
<i>You stepped through that
door at your own free will.</i>

46:59.994 --> 47:01.661
<i>So now</i>

47:01.663 --> 47:03.931
<i>the game must begin.</i>

47:05.400 --> 47:06.367
<i>Good luck.</i>

47:08.269 --> 47:11.704
<i>You have sixty
seconds to your start</i>

47:11.706 --> 47:14.208
<i>before I set them loose on you.</i>

47:16.143 --> 47:17.445
<i>I suggest</i>

47:18.512 --> 47:20.114
<i>you use your time</i>

47:21.215 --> 47:22.316
<i>wisely.</i>

47:41.635 --> 47:42.436
Run!

48:48.734 --> 48:49.601
John?

48:51.203 --> 48:53.272
Hey, John. Is that you?

50:01.538 --> 50:02.805
What?

50:02.807 --> 50:05.908
- Where's Carlos? Where's Carlos? We should go find him.
- Sh.

50:05.910 --> 50:07.110
Be quiet.

50:43.212 --> 50:44.378
- John, please.
- Shhh.

50:44.380 --> 50:45.649
We should get out...

51:07.903 --> 51:11.271
- We can't rescue... Please. Hear to me. He's here...
- Shhh.

51:11.273 --> 51:13.340
Look at me. Shhh.

51:13.342 --> 51:15.241
We're gonna make it
out of here. Okay?

51:15.243 --> 51:16.412
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:19.247 --> 51:20.814
Okay.

51:20.816 --> 51:21.917
Alright, here we go.

51:31.592 --> 51:32.895
Go!

51:51.779 --> 51:53.247
Oh, shit!

52:03.356 --> 52:04.458
Go!

52:50.804 --> 52:51.671
Wait!

53:08.921 --> 53:10.554
Go!

54:58.996 --> 54:59.997
Come in!

55:03.000 --> 55:04.065
How are you doing?

55:04.067 --> 55:06.234
- Please don't take it...
- Babe, I got to take it...

55:06.236 --> 55:08.469
We got to leave.
Are you alright?

55:08.471 --> 55:09.906
I can't move, just
take the damn thing here...

55:11.241 --> 55:13.807
- It's going to bleed a lot though!
- It hurts!

55:13.809 --> 55:15.843
- Oh, shit!
- Carlos!

55:15.845 --> 55:17.011
Are you okay?

55:17.013 --> 55:19.815
Oh, shit, the door!
Hold the door!

55:30.793 --> 55:32.061
Oh, lord, Carlos!

55:35.731 --> 55:37.033
What?

55:39.669 --> 55:41.668
Okay... Okay.

55:41.670 --> 55:42.637
Right, okay.

55:44.639 --> 55:45.841
Look at the venting!

55:57.919 --> 55:59.020
Through the venting!

57:47.726 --> 57:48.593
Stop!

57:50.096 --> 57:51.431
Why are you doing this to us?

57:55.301 --> 57:57.301
You need to play the game.

57:57.303 --> 57:59.338
We just... We just want to go.

58:00.639 --> 58:01.940
Nobody goes home.

58:28.133 --> 58:29.301
<i>Get up!</i>

58:31.036 --> 58:32.736
<i>And finish it!</i>

58:45.317 --> 58:47.718
They are not far
from the next room.

58:48.953 --> 58:52.388
Now, get up.

58:52.390 --> 58:55.326
<i>Go after them and do it.</i>

59:20.950 --> 59:23.051
I got you. Come on.

59:23.053 --> 59:24.821
I can't.

59:25.755 --> 59:26.956
- I can't.
- Keep moving.

59:27.957 --> 59:29.092
I can't...

59:29.993 --> 59:31.893
- I can't. I can't.
- Shh.

59:31.895 --> 59:32.896
Come on.

59:41.437 --> 59:42.472
That's alright.

59:46.342 --> 59:48.044
I shouldn't have
brought you here...

59:50.446 --> 59:52.148
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

59:54.317 --> 59:56.017
Just keep moving.

59:56.019 --> 59:57.020
Okay?

59:58.888 --> 59:59.888
Come on.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.438
Come on.

01:00:16.372 --> 01:00:17.272
Come on.

01:00:31.186 --> 01:00:32.786
Come on!

01:00:32.788 --> 01:00:33.889
Go!

01:00:39.061 --> 01:00:40.229
Let's go, let's go!

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:42.297
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:46.235
Carlos!

01:00:49.504 --> 01:00:50.771
No!

01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:54.209
God...

01:00:55.142 --> 01:00:56.077
No!

01:01:38.885 --> 01:01:41.021
It is a glorious day.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:51.865
We gotta go.

01:01:53.199 --> 01:01:54.401
We've gotta go, okay?

01:02:43.449 --> 01:02:44.950
What is this place?

01:03:01.099 --> 01:03:04.135
They are in the meat room.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.574
Don't fucking move!

01:03:46.744 --> 01:03:48.009
Who are you people?

01:03:48.011 --> 01:03:48.945
Who are you?

01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:53.081
- I'm no one.
- What is this?

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:54.117
The game.

01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:56.119
What game?

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.487
- The game you chose to play.
- No!

01:03:59.489 --> 01:04:00.756
Oh, yes.

01:04:00.758 --> 01:04:02.424
You found the book.

01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:04.092
You followed it here.

01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:05.695
Like everyone else before you.

01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:08.665
How do we get out of here?
How do we get out of here?

01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:11.568
You don't.

01:04:12.736 --> 01:04:15.439
<i>It's impossible.</i>

01:04:25.114 --> 01:04:26.081
John.

01:04:27.384 --> 01:04:28.317
Let's go...

01:04:29.653 --> 01:04:30.654
Let's go.

01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:06.547
- You broke the rules.
- No.

01:06:07.782 --> 01:06:09.249
I can fix it.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.085
I can play the game.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:03.500
John... John!

01:07:03.502 --> 01:07:04.337
John...

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:06.570
John...

01:07:06.572 --> 01:07:08.706
John, John! Look at me!

01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:09.642
Oh, no!

01:07:13.546 --> 01:07:14.513
John!

01:09:18.434 --> 01:09:19.801
Comfortable, yes?

01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:54.336
This is going to be
long and painful.

01:10:43.918 --> 01:10:46.587
Clever girl!

01:11:03.603 --> 01:11:04.404
No, Sir!

01:11:05.538 --> 01:11:07.507
We didn't expect that
to happen, Sir.

01:11:10.144 --> 01:11:11.411
Yes, Sir.

01:11:12.679 --> 01:11:16.080
I can guarantee that she will
not leave this place alive, Sir.

01:11:16.082 --> 01:11:18.084
And if she does,
she won't get far.

01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:24.991
All games have ended, Sir.

01:11:26.559 --> 01:11:27.959
No, Sir.

01:11:27.961 --> 01:11:29.462
No survivors.

01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:36.801
The other set of books?

01:11:36.803 --> 01:11:38.635
Shipping out tonight, Sir.

01:11:38.637 --> 01:11:42.407
They should reach their destination
within the next 48 hours, Sir.

01:11:44.944 --> 01:11:46.978
Don't worry, Sir.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.481
We'll take
care of her, Sir.

01:11:51.483 --> 01:11:52.784
We always do, Sir.

01:14:25.868 --> 01:14:27.535
Your fucking game is over!

01:16:16.476 --> 01:16:18.345
Madam,
there's nothing here.

01:16:18.777 --> 01:16:19.778
No blood...

01:16:20.713 --> 01:16:22.414
No room with monitors...
There's nothing.

01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:24.884
You have to believe me.

01:16:26.318 --> 01:16:26.952
You have to!

01:16:29.989 --> 01:16:32.291
My friends, they... were here.

01:16:33.826 --> 01:16:36.028
These people, they...
They did this to me!

01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.998
They killed them.

01:16:40.065 --> 01:16:42.832
They killed my
boyfriend, please.

01:16:42.834 --> 01:16:44.501
They tried to kill me.

01:16:44.503 --> 01:16:45.968
Please, you have to believe me!

01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:47.206
Calm down, okay?

01:16:48.374 --> 01:16:50.773
We couldn't find anything
you said in your statement.

01:16:50.775 --> 01:16:53.009
I'll show you. Let me show you, okay?
I'll show you. I'll show you...

01:16:53.011 --> 01:16:54.346
Calm down, madam. Calm down!

01:16:57.349 --> 01:16:58.384
Let me show you? Okay?

01:17:00.218 --> 01:17:01.753
I'm not making this up.

01:17:04.222 --> 01:17:06.157
Please! You have to believe me!

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.396
It was here. It was all here.

01:17:16.267 --> 01:17:18.034
He was...

01:17:18.036 --> 01:17:19.103
He was here!

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:27.842
No, but John was here, he was!
He was... he was here.

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:30.879
Madam. Madam, quiet. Okay?

01:17:30.881 --> 01:17:32.749
No, no, you have to believe
me, please! Please!

01:17:37.255 --> 01:17:39.691
- Madam? Madam!
- John was here! No! He was...

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.927
You have to believe me!

01:19:57.157 --> 01:19:58.592
Miss Johnson.

01:20:02.563 --> 01:20:03.997
Please, don't scream.

01:20:05.632 --> 01:20:06.567
Please...

01:20:08.168 --> 01:20:09.368
Please...

01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:11.403
Relax, Miss Johnson.

01:20:11.405 --> 01:20:14.274
If I wanted to hurt you,
I would have done so already.

01:20:17.009 --> 01:20:19.912
On the contrary, I'm
here to congratulate you.

01:20:20.947 --> 01:20:22.483
You should be proud of yourself.

01:20:24.183 --> 01:20:27.321
You're the first to make it out
of our event in one piece.

01:20:29.088 --> 01:20:32.559
The rules of our little game are
simple and must be abided at all times.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:37.330
No one lives to talk
about the game.

01:20:38.965 --> 01:20:39.633
No one.

01:20:42.201 --> 01:20:44.003
You broke that rule.

01:20:45.338 --> 01:20:46.472
You won

01:20:47.573 --> 01:20:49.442
but at no avail, I'm afraid.

01:20:50.977 --> 01:20:52.011
Who are you?

01:20:53.112 --> 01:20:54.680
Who I am doesn't matter.

01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:57.250
What matters is this:

01:20:59.519 --> 01:21:01.352
no matter how far you run,

01:21:01.354 --> 01:21:04.590
no matter where you
try to hide, we will be there,

01:21:05.758 --> 01:21:07.092
Miss Johnson.

01:21:08.728 --> 01:21:10.228
Nothing ends

01:21:11.296 --> 01:21:12.565
unless we say so.

01:21:14.132 --> 01:21:15.468
Do you understand?

01:21:21.173 --> 01:21:24.142
Now, these are the new rules.

01:21:25.778 --> 01:21:28.180
You will leave
this place in two hours.

01:21:29.414 --> 01:21:32.417
Two hours and we'll...
we'll start hunting you down.

01:21:36.688 --> 01:21:41.426
Ah, you just lost four
seconds, Miss Johnson.

01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:47.432
I'll see you on the other
side, Miss Johnson.
