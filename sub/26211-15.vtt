42:15.233 --> 42:18.033
Next time on the season finale
of "Below Deck"...

42:18.066 --> 42:19.066
- Happy birthday!

42:19.100 --> 42:20.266
- I love you guys so much.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.133
I'm so happy.
Like, whatever.

42:22.166 --> 42:23.400
- Get out of my room, Kam.

42:23.433 --> 42:25.033
- I organized
the ----ing fireworks

42:25.066 --> 42:27.100
and you have been
treating me like sh--!

42:27.133 --> 42:28.300
- To a great season.

42:28.333 --> 42:30.333
- Now let's ----ing rage.

42:30.367 --> 42:32.633
- We're running out of days,
and it sucks.

42:32.667 --> 42:34.166
You've got 15 minutes.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.633
- [groans]

42:35.667 --> 42:37.166
- Today's the day.
We're all done.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.633
It's time to go.

42:38.667 --> 42:40.633
- The jokes you made
were inappropriate

42:40.667 --> 42:42.233
and they didn't make me
feel good at all.

42:42.266 --> 42:43.333
- If you would have said
it was inappropriate,

42:43.367 --> 42:44.600
I would have stopped instantly.

42:44.633 --> 42:46.300
- And I'm telling you now.

42:46.333 --> 42:47.667
- Hey, we go.

42:47.700 --> 42:49.233
- He's lost it.

42:49.266 --> 42:51.200
He wants to be the star
of the final dinner.

42:51.233 --> 42:52.333
- We're gonna do
a table decoration.

42:52.367 --> 42:53.767
- With a sea slug.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.266
- [shudders]

42:55.300 --> 42:56.600
- Sounds disgusting.

42:56.633 --> 42:58.133
- Six weeks of work,

42:58.166 --> 43:00.066
you've never gone snorkeling
for table décor.

43:00.100 --> 43:02.066
- (BLEEP), it's very
passive-aggressive

43:02.100 --> 43:04.066
at the end of the ----ing day.

43:04.100 --> 43:07.100
