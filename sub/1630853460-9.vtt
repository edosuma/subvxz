28:14.818 --> 28:16.403
I have a question.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.364
What if I don't want to answer?

28:20.323 --> 28:21.741
Have you always been a coward?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.038
Yuri Ismaylov

28:27.580 --> 28:30.417
is many things, you traitor.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.127
But he isâ€¦

28:32.711 --> 28:33.628
no coward.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.923
If that is so,

28:37.006 --> 28:38.466
why do you continue to stall?

28:38.550 --> 28:41.052
What do I owe these Americans?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.137
Nothing!

28:42.220 --> 28:44.848
This isn't just about America, smuggler.

28:48.059 --> 28:52.647
They have warned us
of a great evil in the world.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.401
An evil that does not rest,

28:56.484 --> 28:58.319
that does not respect borders.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.197
After it has consumed
everything in their land,

29:01.990 --> 29:03.575
it will come for us.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.493
For our families.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.871
For our Motherland.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.084
You saw it with your own eyes.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.961
You know it to be true.

29:15.044 --> 29:18.006
And yet you continue to play tricks!

29:27.056 --> 29:30.226
I was told the Peanut Butter Smuggler

29:30.310 --> 29:32.520
was once a great man.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.899
Before he lost his way to drink and cards.

29:35.982 --> 29:39.903
That he led his men to victory
over the Chinese in Damansky.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.404
Is it true?

29:42.405 --> 29:43.239
It is true.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.117
That hero, where is he now?

29:47.994 --> 29:49.704
Because I do not see him.

53:10.478 --> 53:12.147
What happened here?
