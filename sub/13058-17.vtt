Your brother didn't
kill Felix alone.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.474
As you know, a major part

37:24.476 --> 37:27.811
in flying a helicopter
to Arizona and back

37:27.813 --> 37:30.280
is the precise measurement
of fuel.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.182
And the amount of gas needed
is based on weight.

37:32.184 --> 37:34.117
The heavier the freight,
the more fuel.

37:34.119 --> 37:37.787
And calculating the right amount
of gas can get complicated.

37:37.789 --> 37:40.156

for that.

one calculation
for the way there...

37:52.537 --> 37:54.871
And another for the way back,
and it weighed much less.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.207
By about 550 pounds.

37:57.209 --> 38:00.443
That's 100 pounds each
for three bales of pot.

38:00.445 --> 38:05.482
And 250 pounds for Felix, who
you intended to leave behind.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.051

by both of you.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.955
