WEBVTT

00:13.596 --> 00:16.516
Looks like the FBI
already took anything useful.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.769
[Raymond]
The FBI has no idea what's useful to me.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.316
Maybe we'll find the shooter.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.028
I don't know,
we've got everyone out there,

00:28.903 --> 00:30.739
but a guy on a motorcycle?

00:31.656 --> 00:33.533
That bike's in pieces by now.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.161
The shell casings are a dead end.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.955
Shooter could be anyone, anywhere.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.291
All we can do is keep looking.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.839
Whoever killed Elizabeth
is going to a lot of trouble

00:47.922 --> 00:49.841
to keep you from finding them.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.886
Seems like it would just be
easier to take you out.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.971
Perhaps they need me.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.724
Or they're saving me
for something special.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.769
-Could be they love you.
-Or it could be all three.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.021
This is something. What is this?

01:09.486 --> 01:12.447
Now, this is an item
that definitely should not be

01:12.530 --> 01:15.825
in the possession
of a former NYPD officer,

01:16.659 --> 01:19.079
even a crooked one like Reggie Cole.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.663
What is it?

01:20.747 --> 01:25.960
It's a key to a vault that's inside
one of the most inaccessible,

01:26.044 --> 01:29.547
enigmatic security facilities
in the world.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.883
How do you know that?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.135
I have one just like it.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.440
[door opens]

01:49.943 --> 01:53.279
Harold. The judge is taking the bench now.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.990
She's gonna arraign Lew Sloan first.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.326
I can give you guys
a few minutes alone together.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.452
Thank you.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.707
[door closes]

02:09.796 --> 02:12.382
Is it true? About the cop?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.926
-Mateo said that he was killed.
-He and his lawyer.

02:15.009 --> 02:18.096
We couldn't hold him. As soon
as they left, they were gunned down.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.931
By who? Why?

02:20.014 --> 02:23.434
I don't know. It's somehow
connected to Elizabeth's murder.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.937
Which means it's connected to Reddington.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.523
He's not to blame,
if that's what you mean.

02:28.606 --> 02:32.569
I lied for you to the cops
to give you an alibi.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.070
I lied for you, not him.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.990
No charges will be filed against you.
Cynthia gave me her word.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.410
Well, Senator Panabaker
lets Reddington do as he pleases.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.038
And as soon as you and poor Lew try
to figure out who framed you for murder,

02:44.122 --> 02:45.582
she lets you both rot.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.710
This isn't on her, Char. This is on me.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.795
Based on my years of service,

02:50.879 --> 02:53.172
my attorney expects
I'll be released without bail.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.717
So hopefully, I can return to work.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.929
Elizabeth left Agnes with us

03:00.013 --> 03:03.266
as parents, role models.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.436
You wanna make this right
for me, I understand.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.354
But you have to make it right for her.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.572
Thank you, Walter.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.785
Helen. What a delight to see you.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.750
I've been making
a great effort not to be seen.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.293
By anyone.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.545
How did you know where to find me?

03:32.629 --> 03:36.424
The real mystery is
why you're hiding in the private room

03:36.507 --> 03:38.593
and why you aren't returning calls.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.929
Too many questions, Raymond.

03:41.012 --> 03:44.140
What can I do for you today
other than marvel at your deductive powers

03:44.224 --> 03:46.351
and tolerate your unwanted presence?

03:47.143 --> 03:51.064
A dead cop is storing
something of value in Mount Bastion.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.482
I need to know what.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.109
I need to get inside this vault.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.237
Impossible.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.072
You engineered the impossible

03:59.155 --> 04:02.617
when you carved out the core
of a granite mountain

04:02.700 --> 04:05.787
to build your impenetrable facility.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.874
I have more pressing concerns
than enabling your criminal mischief.

04:10.917 --> 04:11.918
Tell me.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.382
I recently consulted on a job.

04:18.049 --> 04:22.303
A heist crew needed a way to steal cargo
from a heavily guarded container yard.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.307
My rig worked beautifully,
but the crew left evidence behind.

04:26.391 --> 04:30.186
Now they're in federal custody,
using my name to cut a deal.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.774
If I'm not a wanted woman already,
I fear I shall be at any moment.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.443
It seems we both have itchy backs.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.571
An opportunity
to scratch each other's itch?

04:44.742 --> 04:45.743
[judge] Mr. Cooper.

04:45.827 --> 04:50.498
It's not every day an assistant director
of the FBI graces us with his presence.

04:50.581 --> 04:53.084
Particularly on the wrong side of the bar.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.378
How do you plea to the charges
against you today?

04:55.461 --> 04:57.213
Not guilty, Your Honor.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.340
[judge] I'll hear the defense on bail.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.844
Defense asks for release
with no bail, Your Honor.

05:02.927 --> 05:06.180
Harold Cooper has led a long
and distinguished career--

05:06.264 --> 05:09.350
Long and formerly distinguished.
Until ten years ago.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.602
After that? Who knows. No one will say.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.730
Everyone knows everything in this town,

05:13.813 --> 05:17.317
but what he does and how he does it is...
No one has a clue.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.526
[Desoto] Your Honor--

05:18.609 --> 05:20.653
[prosecutor] Which means
he can go anywhere, anytime.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.157
Which makes him,
by any reasonable standard, a flight risk.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.994
Bail is set at $300,000.
Trial in six weeks.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.203
[gavel bangs]

05:32.332 --> 05:33.958
Honey, we'll get the money.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.961
We can cash out
an insurance policy if we have to.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.091
I'm sorry I couldn't do more.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.303
You kept Charlene out of this mess.
That's enough.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.847
We're not stopping
until we find out who's behind this.

05:47.930 --> 05:51.517
If I had any say, the only Blacklister
we'd go after is the person who did this.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.519
You do have a say. The say.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.480
You haven't told him yet?

05:55.563 --> 05:58.900
Until the judge miscarried justice,
I was hoping I wouldn't have to.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.026
Have to what?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.778
Give you my job.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.695
What?

06:03.571 --> 06:04.405
No.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.575
You have my full confidence
and blessings, and you...

06:08.117 --> 06:09.660
-Harold...
-We have to go.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.666
I can't do this.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.377
Probably not. But Harold chose you.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.590
-What about Agent Ressler?
-What about him?

06:22.673 --> 06:25.384
You eat life, or life eats you,
Agent Mojtabai.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.596
You're the boss now, so bon appÃ©tit.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.817
This is only until Mr. Cooper is back.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.362
Which I hope is really, really soon.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.490
I'm just a figurehead,
like Colonel Sanders.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.450
They need a face on the bucket.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.953
It should've been your face.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.123
Square jaw, dimpled,
top of the pecking order.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.583
I had my shot. It's your turn.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.835
You'll be fine.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.004
I understand congratulations are in order.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.923
Says the man who really rules the roost.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.300
If I may offer some counsel?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.928
Do not go where the path may lead.

07:09.011 --> 07:13.516
Go instead where there is no path
and leave a trail.

07:14.517 --> 07:18.521
In the spirit of that,
I bring an unusual case.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.024
A Blacklister not to catch but to release.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.776
Oh, here we go. Good luck.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.778
Helen Maghi,

07:26.320 --> 07:32.660
one of the world's most accomplished
structural and geotechnical engineers.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.706
In Iraq, Maghi designed
a floating bridge to carry tanks

07:36.789 --> 07:40.084
and heavy-armor vehicles across
the Euphrates River in the dark of night.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.212
Her crowning achievement is Mount Bastion.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.923
Using proprietary drilling techniques,

07:46.007 --> 07:50.845
she carved into
a Pennsylvania mountain of solid granite

07:50.928 --> 07:56.684
to create an impregnable storage facility
favored by the criminal elite,

07:56.767 --> 08:02.565
with more safeguards and redundancies
than the U.S. Bullion Depository.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.525
And you wanna break into it.

08:04.609 --> 08:09.947
Well, we found this key
in Reggie Cole's office.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.327
A key to a storage vault in Mount Bastion.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.914
Mount Bastion would never rent
a vault to a former officer,

08:17.997 --> 08:19.874
but they might to his employer.

08:19.957 --> 08:24.086
His employer, Harold's blackmailer,
Elizabeth's killer,

08:24.170 --> 08:25.546
all the same person.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.382
What are we waiting for?
Let's storm the mountain.

08:28.466 --> 08:32.345
Impossible without Maghi's help.
That's where the task force comes in.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.972
She provided engineering services

08:35.056 --> 08:38.184
to some heist crew
working the Port of Virginia.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.145
The crew was just arrested by the FBI,

08:41.229 --> 08:45.900
and Helen is afraid
they'll sell her out in a plea bargain.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.403
You want us to make the case
against Maghi go away,

08:49.487 --> 08:52.865
in exchange for her help
breaking into Mount Bastion?

08:53.991 --> 08:57.036
How do we feel about that?
Show of hands for yes?

09:00.414 --> 09:02.208
Right. I am in charge here.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.626
Okay. Uh...

09:03.709 --> 09:07.922
Agent Ressler, Agent Zuma, track down
the FBI team that made the arrest.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.383
We'll start by finding out
what case they have.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.467
You got it.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.219
And Harold, how is he?

09:13.302 --> 09:16.639
Not good. He's stuck in jail
with a bail he can't afford.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.687
They cut open a shipping container
in the middle of the yard,

09:22.770 --> 09:26.023
directly in front of security cameras.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.692
And nobody saw a thing.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.362
-How did they do that?
-Look at that red container.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.739
Now check it out 15 minutes later.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.492
And after that.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.911
And after that.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.913
Who was moving it?

09:40.997 --> 09:44.000
It was moving itself, slowly.

09:44.083 --> 09:48.421
The motion cameras didn't detect it
and the security guards never noticed.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.423
The crew was hiding inside.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.883
They retrofitted the container
with hidden wheels,

09:52.967 --> 09:55.970
then crept it into position
next to the stolen cargo

09:56.053 --> 09:59.557
to block security cameras.
It was brilliantly engineered,

09:59.640 --> 10:02.476
which makes sense
given the woman who hired them.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.477
Helen Maghi.

10:03.561 --> 10:07.898
Now our intel says that she was
hired by the crew, as a consultant.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.567
Someone is playing you.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.903
The crew we're talking about
are high school dropouts.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.948
-What did they steal?
-Six crates of RPGs.

10:16.490 --> 10:19.535
According to our suspects,
Maghi made plans to ship them

10:19.619 --> 10:21.662
to separatist forces in Kazban.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.664
Put it simply, she's arming terrorists.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.084
Mr. Homan? I don't know who that is.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.587
-Our friend with the hat.
-He posted bail?

10:29.670 --> 10:33.132
All $300,000. Once the payment
goes through, you can go home.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.426
Have you spoken
with the prosecutor about a deal?

10:35.509 --> 10:37.011
A deal? A deal for what?

10:37.094 --> 10:39.639
She'll take two years
if you plead guilty to conspiracy.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.350
-No.
-Char, it's 15 if I go to trial.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.643
But you were framed.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.812
And to find out why, I tampered
with evidence and witnesses,

10:46.896 --> 10:49.482
and let you lie to create my alibi.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.276
You were right.
I have to make this right for Agnes.

10:52.860 --> 10:57.073
-A deal is the best way to do that.
-So, Harold, tell her we're good?

10:57.156 --> 11:00.159
On one condition.
I won't testify against Lew.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.913
He wouldn't cut a deal to hurt me,
and I won't cut one that hurts him.

11:03.996 --> 11:04.914
Okay.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.928
Go ahead. Read the results.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.348
I'm not trying to read anything.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.767
I'm trying to remember.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.854
I miss Mierce.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.568
[cell phone buzzing]

11:40.574 --> 11:41.409
Is it done?

11:41.492 --> 11:45.121
We spoke to the Bureau
about the heist crew you say hired her.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.625
Only they say she hired them,
and that she's a terrorist.

11:49.708 --> 11:53.337
While dramatic statements
are effective attention grabbers,

11:53.421 --> 11:57.299
overstatement merely serves
to try your listener's patience.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.759
<i>I'm not being dramatic.</i>

11:58.843 --> 12:00.469
Or maybe I am.

12:00.553 --> 12:05.474
Because stealing RPGs to arm extremists
in Kazban is, well, pretty dramatic,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.351
and apparently, what she did.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.021
We need the FBI
to lose interest in Helen Maghi.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.442
It's the only way for us
to obtain information we need

12:14.525 --> 12:17.111
to avenge Elizabeth and free Harold.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.281
You asked us to look
into Maghi's claims, and we did.

12:20.364 --> 12:24.034
And now I'm asking you
to do the same, respectfully.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.828
<i>Please?</i>

12:25.911 --> 12:28.956
Another word of advice: moral relativism.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.624
-That's two words.
<i>-Yes.</i>

12:30.708 --> 12:32.585
But one piece of advice.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.016
Did you lie to me, Helen?

12:47.808 --> 12:52.730
Fresh intel says you've been
arming separatists in a war-torn country,

12:52.813 --> 12:55.858
putting innocent civilians at risk.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.360
-And you know me better than that.
-[Raymond] I do.

12:58.444 --> 13:03.866
But my contact in law enforcement has been
replaced by a conscience with ears,

13:03.949 --> 13:08.996
so I am unable, at present,
to wave your federal troubles away.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.957
Then we have little to discuss.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.461
On the other hand,
I could make you disappear.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.671
I'm sorry, is that a threat?

13:17.755 --> 13:19.465
What I'm offering is a gift.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.343
While I can't stop the FBI
from looking for you,

13:22.426 --> 13:25.221
I can certainly make sure
they never find you.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.723
New papers, private estates.

13:27.806 --> 13:31.143
Reflexologist on call, day and night.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.147
-I prefer shiatsu.
-Done.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.734
If I help you break into
the mountain fortress I designed?

13:39.527 --> 13:42.530
There must be something
quite valuable hidden inside that vault.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.989
I hope so, Helen.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.324
I really do.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.542
-Can I help?
-I got it.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.710
-I insist.
-What are you doing?

13:56.794 --> 13:58.587
Taking this back where it belongs.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.715
Raymond gave us a case that can help
find the person who framed you.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.926
He's the one
who should be on trial, not you.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.970
I'm not on trial.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.681
I agreed to plead guilty.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.558
[Aram] Wait. What?

14:10.641 --> 14:11.475
No.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.227
No, no, no.

14:14.436 --> 14:15.938
You can't. Because...

14:17.523 --> 14:18.524
you're not.

14:18.607 --> 14:22.611
But I am. And finding the person
who set me up won't change that.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.948
Two years. With good behavior,
maybe 18 months.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.283
Then it's over.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.827
Unfortunately, so is my career.

14:29.910 --> 14:34.206
So thank you,
but I'll take the box where it belongs.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.383
Ah. Harold. Hello.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.135
Hello, Mr. Homan.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.679
Thank you for my bail. I'll repay it.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.307
I'm not sure how or when.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.349
Harold...

14:54.018 --> 14:59.023
the deal, your plea to fall
on your all-too-honorable sword,

14:59.106 --> 15:02.026
have you told Agnes about it?

15:02.109 --> 15:04.987
Have I told her that her life
is being upended again? No.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.199
Of everything that's happening,
that's the thing I dread the most.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.284
Then don't.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.370
You want to repay me for bailing you out?

15:13.454 --> 15:14.288
Say nothing.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.165
I can't protect her from this.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.500
No. But perhaps, I can.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.794
Then you have my word.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.046
And my curiosity.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.548
All I need is your patience.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.556
Helen Maghi denies arming terrorists.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.559
Do you know a lot of people
who would admit to arming terrorists?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.644
I do. Yes.

15:36.727 --> 15:40.898
I also enjoy that degree
of honesty with Helen Maghi.

15:40.981 --> 15:45.319
A fact I only mentioned
to put your righteous mind at ease

15:45.402 --> 15:46.820
about working with her.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.032
I can't make the heist crew's
testimony go away. She--

15:51.033 --> 15:54.536
-She will be indicted.
-Yes. Wheels of justice and all that.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.372
Terrible metaphor, really.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.500
Wheels turn, justice sits.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.129
Nonetheless, Helen has agreed
to help us break into Mount Bastion.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.464
How did you make her agree?

16:05.547 --> 16:09.093
The only relevant question is,
will you agree to help?

16:09.176 --> 16:11.762
You do know that's your chair now, right?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.974
Go on. It won't bite.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.191
This feels wrong.

16:24.274 --> 16:27.528
Well, I'm sure there's a knob
underneath you can adjust.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.612
Not the chair.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.533
Oh, well, give it time. You'll do fine.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.952
I don't mean the job. I mean, the case.

16:35.035 --> 16:38.956
Despite what Maghi told you,
I have solid intel that Kazban rebels

16:39.039 --> 16:42.376
are expecting a shipment
of stolen RPGs from the U.S.,

16:42.459 --> 16:45.504
and, well, Maghi is accused
of stealing RPGs.

16:45.587 --> 16:50.968
So I can't let the team work with a woman
who's actively arming terrorists.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.470
I'm right about Helen Maghi.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.890
You need to trust me on that
and move on with this case.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.685
If for no other reason than if you don't,

17:00.227 --> 17:03.313
Harold will never be able
to reclaim that seat.

17:07.776 --> 17:08.819
Mount Bastion...

17:10.487 --> 17:11.864
how do we get in?

17:11.947 --> 17:16.452
My contract with Mount Bastion was
to engineer impenetrable storage vaults

17:16.535 --> 17:20.789
inside a mountain,
with one heavily fortified way in and out.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.293
To hide its existence
from the outside world,

17:24.376 --> 17:28.297
the facility had to remain
unconnected to the municipal power grid.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.798
So to stay off the grid,

17:29.882 --> 17:33.677
Maghi built her own geothermal
power station inside the mountain.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.972
But this created a hidden vulnerability,
'cause the system needs

17:37.056 --> 17:41.060
a constant supply of circulating water
to dissipate the thermal load.

17:41.143 --> 17:45.230
That water is piped in underground
from a nearby lake.

17:45.314 --> 17:49.610
If anything happens to that water supply,
the system, including security,

17:49.693 --> 17:51.695
will overheat and shut down.

17:51.779 --> 17:56.533
So Maghi provided us with GPS coordinates

17:56.617 --> 17:59.787
of an emergency valve
hidden on the mountainside.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.207
Once Mr. Reddington and Agent Zuma
are inside the mountain,

18:03.290 --> 18:05.834
you two need to close the valve
and cut the water supply.

18:05.918 --> 18:10.089
How do Red and Dembe get inside?
I thought the place was like Fort Knox.

18:10.172 --> 18:13.008
[Aram] <i>Turns out, Mr. Reddington</i>
<i>has a vault there.</i>

18:13.092 --> 18:16.929
<i>As his former bodyguard,</i>
<i>Dembe has security clearance too.</i>

18:17.012 --> 18:23.143
This should enable both of them to clear
the three levels of biometric scanners.

18:23.227 --> 18:29.525
And from there, it is 30 floors down
to the subterranean vaults.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.820
But as you know, the guard
will escort you to your private vault,

18:32.903 --> 18:35.114
so you have to go there first.

18:35.197 --> 18:39.785
<i>By the time you reach the vault,</i>
<i>your support team needs to be in position.</i>

18:39.868 --> 18:41.787
[Aram] <i>Mount Bastion keeps the valve</i>

18:41.870 --> 18:46.166
under tight watch with two guards.
Relieve them before their shift ends,

18:46.250 --> 18:50.045
which gives us a short window
before the real guards arrive.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.463
[knock on door]

18:53.423 --> 18:54.716
[lock buzzes]

18:55.134 --> 18:56.969
Hey, guys. We got it from here.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.138
You're early.
We still got a half hour left.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.099
This is our first assignment.
Didn't want to be late.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.726
Be our guest.

19:20.617 --> 19:24.288
When you get the signal, you need
to find this high-pressure water valve

19:24.371 --> 19:25.622
and turn it off quickly.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.709
Without water for cooling,
the power system will shut down

19:28.792 --> 19:30.586
and switch to auxiliary power.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.588
When that happens, the guards are ordered

19:32.671 --> 19:35.299
to lock clients into their vaults
to keep them safe,

19:35.382 --> 19:38.760
and then report to the perimeter
to provide security for the facility.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.138
<i>At that point,</i>
<i>the Mount Bastion controller</i>

19:41.221 --> 19:45.642
<i>will call Maghi, the systems designer,</i>
<i>to figure out what the problem is.</i>

19:45.726 --> 19:47.144
[cell phone ringing]

19:51.607 --> 19:53.734
-Hello?
<i>-Helen, it's Terry.</i>

19:53.817 --> 19:55.694
<i>We have a Tier 1 problem on the mountain.</i>

19:55.777 --> 19:58.614
Send me a remote access code,
and I'll take care of it.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.495
All right. I have surveillance
running on an endless loop.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.663
How long do we have?

20:06.747 --> 20:09.458
[Helen] <i>You have six minutes to get</i>
<i>to the other vault and back.</i>

20:09.541 --> 20:12.169
After that, the system reboots
and it's shoot to kill.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.713
I'm sorry. I wish I could
give you more time.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.757
You've given us enough. I hope.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.799
[Helen] Go now.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.098
[alarm blaring]

20:38.737 --> 20:40.948
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[alarm blaring]

21:19.278 --> 21:20.487
It can't be.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.782
But somehow it is.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.828
We put it in the safe in Tivat.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.372
Only two people could open it.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.916
And neither of us did.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.963
If it wasn't you or Elizabeth,
then who did?

21:38.880 --> 21:39.798
And how?

21:41.758 --> 21:43.760
This was her future.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.222
What she needed to succeed.

21:48.598 --> 21:52.227
She would have been great.
Stronger than me.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.650
Hurry. You have 30 seconds.

21:59.443 --> 22:03.238
We have to go, Raymond. It's time.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.834
[alarm stops]

22:33.894 --> 22:35.729
Nothing serious, I trust?

22:35.812 --> 22:38.774
Not at all. A venting issue.
But we have the all clear.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.234
And we have what we came for.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.783
Well, it sounds like a win-win.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.620
You got what you wanted,
and I got a new contract

22:51.703 --> 22:55.665
to retrofit the geothermal piping
that caused the shutdown. [chuckling]

22:55.749 --> 22:59.086
A contract you'll be undertaking
in a new life

22:59.169 --> 23:02.172
from an undisclosed location
of your choosing.

23:02.255 --> 23:06.218
Oh, I've chosen.
The Villa Peduzzi on Lake Como.

23:06.301 --> 23:09.179
[Raymond laughs]
<i>A stone's throw from Clooney.</i>

23:09.262 --> 23:11.431
Aram asked me to text him
when we're in the air.

23:11.515 --> 23:15.310
If you see him, please remind him
he owes me a case of tequila

23:15.393 --> 23:18.271
for our wager on the Palio di Siena.

23:25.237 --> 23:29.407
Tac Ops, initiate takedown. Move.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.037
FBI! Hands where we can see them!

23:34.121 --> 23:37.916
No, no, dear.
No need to die on my behalf. Not today.

23:39.709 --> 23:40.836
Thank you, Walter.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.132
Pancakes are not a snack food.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.676
-According to whom?
-Everyone.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.428
Well, everyone hasn't tasted my pancakes.

23:51.972 --> 23:55.684
See. A little butter.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.939
-That's a little-and-a-half.
-And a little-and-a-half of syrup.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.566
[cell phone ringing]

24:02.649 --> 24:05.735
Go on. Sink your fangs into that
and tell me it isn't amazing.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.781
-Hello?
-Harold. We have to talk.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.325
-It's about Lew.
-What happened? Is he all right?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.202
He's fine. You're not.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.550
You agreed to testify against me?

24:28.633 --> 24:29.759
You shouldn't be here.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.636
I would never sell you out. Never.

24:32.262 --> 24:35.849
I planned to do jail time
to protect you. Two years.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.559
Now I can't get less than five.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.395
I'm sorry,
but I wasn't prepared to go to jail.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.939
I got two boys who need their father.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.692
You should've thought about them
before altering my weapon.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.027
I did that to help you!

24:47.110 --> 24:48.403
I never asked you to.

24:48.486 --> 24:52.324
You decided that on your own.
You decided to tamper with evidence.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.202
You're my friend,
and this breaks my heart.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.787
I've got a family I've gotta look out for.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.082
So do I. And thanks to you,
I'm not gonna be able to.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.759
We broke into a mountain fortress
for a box of homemade DVDs?

25:10.842 --> 25:13.720
-That's all that was in the vault?
-What was recorded on them?

25:13.803 --> 25:17.599
A series of instructions
recorded by Raymond for Elizabeth.

25:17.682 --> 25:21.019
And advice
on how to run his empire after he died.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.521
A master class
on how to become a criminal.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.149
To think I signed up for a mixology class.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.776
Why would Reggie Cole steal them?

25:27.859 --> 25:30.570
What good did they do him,
and where did he steal them from?

25:30.654 --> 25:34.074
Good questions,
and Raymond can't answer a single one.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.327
You all did good work on the mountain.

25:37.827 --> 25:41.039
Mr. Reddington got what he was after
and so did we.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.499
What did we get?

25:42.582 --> 25:45.502
Helen Maghi. Our Blacklister.
She's in holding.

25:45.585 --> 25:48.296
-How?
-While you were pulling off the heist,

25:48.380 --> 25:52.217
I dispatched a van with an IMSI-catcher
to intercept any mobile phone traffic

25:52.300 --> 25:53.718
emanating from the mountain.

25:53.802 --> 25:57.430
Once the repair call went out to Maghi,
it was a matter of using her cell signal

25:57.514 --> 25:59.015
to track her location.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.060
So when you asked me to notify you
that we were in the air--

26:02.143 --> 26:04.145
That was the signal to move on the target.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.647
You should have notified me.

26:05.730 --> 26:09.859
I'm sorry, but I did not wanna put you in
Mr. Reddington's line of fire. Any of you.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.738
It was my decision, and
if there's fallout, I'll take the heat.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.409
[cell phone chiming]

26:20.120 --> 26:21.538
Looks like the heat's here.

26:21.621 --> 26:24.541
Put him on speaker. You don't
have to deal with this by yourself.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.380
-Mr. Reddington.
-We had an agreement.

26:30.463 --> 26:34.801
We agreed you wouldn't act on Helen
unless I confirmed your intel.

26:34.884 --> 26:37.804
It wasn't an agreement.
It was more like an order.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.347
Which you disregarded.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.515
Yes, I did.

26:41.141 --> 26:41.975
Where is she?

26:42.058 --> 26:46.187
Agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force
are on their way to take her into custody.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.648
[Helen] <i>And I was just on my way</i>
<i>to take her into hiding,</i>

26:48.732 --> 26:51.568
which I promised to do
in exchange for her help.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.320
I don't break my promises.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.779
It's bad for business.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.906
Mine, and therefore yours.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.326
I'm sorry, but it's done.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.870
<i>Harold Cooper knows when to compromise.</i>

27:01.953 --> 27:05.665
He knows it isn't immoral
because he accepts moral relativism.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.625
<i>Clearly, you do not, which is a problem,</i>

27:07.709 --> 27:10.628
because I can't work with you
until you do.

27:10.712 --> 27:15.717
Then remove me as head of the task force.
Please. I am aging in dog years here.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.262
But I urge you to use
whatever you learned on Mount Bastion

27:19.346 --> 27:20.930
to help us find Elizabeth's killer

27:21.014 --> 27:23.892
and prevent Mr. Cooper
from going to prison.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.143
Helen first.

27:25.226 --> 27:29.314
Helen is going to prison,
which isn't about moral relativism.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.774
It's about doing what's right.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.276
Clearly, you do not see that,
which is also a problem,

27:33.360 --> 27:36.363
<i>because I can't work with you</i>
<i>until you do.</i>

27:37.572 --> 27:38.406
Sir.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.167
[knocking on door]

27:49.250 --> 27:50.752
You don't have to knock.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.590
Took a lot of balls to do what you did.

27:55.673 --> 27:58.385
For which we will all pay a stiff price.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.679
You gave him what he wanted
without compromising your principles.

28:03.306 --> 28:06.351
-Thanks for the pep talk.
-You're welcome. That's not why I came up.

28:06.434 --> 28:10.438
The agents from JTTF are here
to transfer Maghi to Central Detention.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.404
-Agent Mojtabai. Here for the prisoner?
-[man] We are.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.572
Agents McCoy and McConaughey, JTTF.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.784
I've reviewed their paperwork.
Park's bringing out Maghi.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.828
[Ressler] Just a little heads up.

28:24.911 --> 28:28.665
We were told Raymond Reddington
wants to spring Maghi loose.

28:28.748 --> 28:31.459
The Raymond Reddington?
Thanks for the tip.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.420
She's all yours.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.089
Well, well, well. After all these years.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.550
You got a lot to answer for.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.760
Can't wait for our chat.

28:41.636 --> 28:42.929
You'll chat with my lawyer.

28:47.517 --> 28:52.397
I trust everything is in order?
Very good. I'll meet you in a half hour.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.444
I got the information you wanted
about your lady friend.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.363
I don't know if we need to
worry about that anymore, Weecha.

29:00.947 --> 29:05.118
-Too late. I got to the bottom of it.
-Oh, my.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.874
And whom did you get to the bottom of?

29:10.957 --> 29:13.126
This is Mehmet.

29:13.626 --> 29:16.921
He received the cargo from the
shipping container job Helen engineered.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.299
[Raymond] Well, hello, Mehmet.

29:20.049 --> 29:22.469
So you know what was stolen
and where it went?

29:24.554 --> 29:25.597
Tell me.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.603
Agent Aronson. How can I help you?

29:31.686 --> 29:33.396
Helen Maghi's a big fish.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.191
We all reeled her in together.
I didn't wanna miss this.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.485
They are with
the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.403
They'll be taking Maghi into custody.

29:40.487 --> 29:43.531
JTTF was already here.
They took Maghi half an hour ago.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.742
Agents McCoy and McConaughey.

29:46.701 --> 29:49.078
We're Agents McCoy and McConaughey.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.498
-He didn't.
-He couldn't.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.374
He did.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.925
Raymond. What's going on?

30:04.552 --> 30:05.720
Who are these men?

30:05.804 --> 30:09.849
Impostors. My impostors, to be precise.

30:10.558 --> 30:14.813
I told you, you had nothing
to worry about from the FBI. Please sit.

30:19.943 --> 30:24.447
I had an interesting conversation
with a young man. You know him. Mehmet?

30:25.406 --> 30:26.950
He knows you, anyway.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.702
He says you sold him
six crates of heavy artillery

30:29.786 --> 30:31.454
you stole from the Port of Virginia,

30:31.538 --> 30:36.084
which are now on their way to a group
of extremists in some faraway desert.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.507
I didn't do it for money,
if that's what you think.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.300
I'm thinking about survival.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.595
My survival depends on relationships.

30:50.473 --> 30:53.184
I'm gutted you've poisoned ours.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.939
You lied to me.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.316
Twice.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.487
Why?

31:09.742 --> 31:10.743
My son.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.832
[sobbing] They killed my son.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.669
Beheaded him.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.924
He was an aide worker in Kazban,

31:25.925 --> 31:28.428
providing food and shelter
for people with none.

31:29.762 --> 31:33.182
But the state heard a rumor
he was a rebel, so...

31:37.353 --> 31:38.730
they cut off his head.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.569
I'm very sorry to hear that.

31:46.112 --> 31:50.742
I wish you'd shared this painful story
from the start.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.921
We're not going to Italy, are we?

32:04.088 --> 32:06.215
You've proven you can't be trusted.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.972
And you know much too much.

32:15.391 --> 32:18.686
If you were in my shoes,
what would you do?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.066
What would you do if you were in mine?

32:24.734 --> 32:28.863
If someone butchered your only child
for no good reason?

32:31.741 --> 32:36.496
I'm willing to bet you'd stop at nothing
to scorch the very earth they walk on.

32:39.707 --> 32:40.875
That may be.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.051
But if I were you...

32:51.970 --> 32:53.680
and you were me...

32:56.474 --> 33:01.187
I would never ever lie to you.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.779
Take her to Como. See to her needs.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.542
[door opens]

33:23.960 --> 33:25.003
[door closes]

33:42.103 --> 33:44.147
I need to talk to you, honey.

33:44.897 --> 33:46.691
-Did I do something wrong?
-No.

33:48.109 --> 33:48.943
I did.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.157
I did something very wrong.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.577
I lied to a police detective.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.663
I thought I was doing it
for a good reason,

34:00.747 --> 34:02.957
to protect my family from getting hurt.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.917
But I learned something.

34:06.669 --> 34:09.088
That there's never a good reason to lie.

34:10.214 --> 34:15.887
That's okay. At least you learned, right?
That's what you always tell me.

34:16.387 --> 34:20.475
Well, the reason we teach children
when they are children...

34:21.768 --> 34:23.227
is because when you're an adult,

34:23.311 --> 34:25.730
there can be
serious consequences for bad behavior.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.483
And now...

34:30.401 --> 34:31.819
I have to pay for mine.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.455
Really? In the Senate parking garage?

34:42.538 --> 34:45.041
You send two guys to "give me a lift"?

34:45.124 --> 34:49.295
You're the fox in the henhouse,
and I'm the sheepdog. Not a good look.

34:50.963 --> 34:54.425
Harold is scheduled
for sentencing this afternoon.

34:54.926 --> 34:58.096
He's pleading
to five years he doesn't deserve.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.597
I'd help him if I could.

34:59.680 --> 35:04.352
If ifs and buts were candy and nuts,
oh, what a Christmas we'd have.

35:05.561 --> 35:08.731
You're not a sheepdog, Cynthia,
you're Santa Claus.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.651
And you're not going to give Harold coal.

35:11.734 --> 35:15.905
Harold is clenched firmly
in the jaws of the legal system.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.491
There is no path forward here
but to let it play out.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.743
If you don't mind, I'll be going.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.579
"Otherwise Illegal Activity."

35:26.457 --> 35:27.583
Excuse me?

35:27.667 --> 35:31.546
A federal agent, usually undercover,
fills out an application

35:31.629 --> 35:36.134
that, when approved,
authorizes him or her to bend laws

35:36.217 --> 35:39.345
with almost
no judicial review or oversight,

35:39.428 --> 35:41.139
all to catch a criminal.

35:41.222 --> 35:44.016
Harold was operating
with no such authorization.

35:44.100 --> 35:47.228
But he was chasing a killer
who murdered Doug Koster

35:47.311 --> 35:50.398
and framed Harold
to gain leverage over him.

35:50.481 --> 35:55.570
How hard could it be
to backdate one of those fancy forms

35:55.653 --> 35:57.738
to explain his actions?

35:57.822 --> 36:00.616
As a member
of the Senate Judiciary Committee,

36:00.700 --> 36:02.785
I won't participate in a cover up.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.079
Harold shouldn't have hidden.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.789
Agreed. But he did.

36:08.207 --> 36:13.212
Cynthia, to spare our loved ones from pain
and to get to the truth,

36:13.296 --> 36:17.800
who among us wouldn't abandon
a few of our firmest principles?

36:17.884 --> 36:20.636
Like rats from a sinking ship.

36:20.720 --> 36:24.182
I'm sorry you have
such a dark view of humanity, Raymond,

36:24.265 --> 36:27.435
but not all of us
would compromise our ethics so willingly.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.686
Is that a fact?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.526
[woman screaming on recording]

36:37.069 --> 36:39.322
[Raymond on recording]
<i>You seem ill at ease.</i>

36:39.405 --> 36:41.449
[Panabaker] <i>Well,</i> <i>there</i> <i>is</i> <i>a</i> <i>line</i>

36:41.532 --> 36:45.077
<i>I</i> <i>have studiously avoided crossing</i>
<i>in</i> <i>my</i> <i>career.</i> <i>Until</i> <i>now.</i>

36:45.161 --> 36:46.787
[recording stops]

36:47.663 --> 36:51.834
That terrible sound came from
a woman you brought to me two weeks ago

36:51.918 --> 36:53.961
to interrogate for information.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.088
You recorded that?

36:56.172 --> 36:59.717
She'd harmed your daughter-in-law,
who was harming your granddaughter.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.681
I wonder how that recording would play
for your Judiciary Committee.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.311
I thought you were trying to help me.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.896
I did help you.

37:13.147 --> 37:14.899
And now you can help me.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.027
Or Harold, to be precise.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.114
You son of a bitch.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.785
Okay, but then again,
you didn't know my father.

37:30.539 --> 37:31.666
[Charlene] It's time.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.877
[Agnes sobbing]

37:34.961 --> 37:35.920
It'll be okay.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.966
-I'm not gonna let you go.
-[Cooper] You don't have to.

37:40.633 --> 37:45.096
I'm never gonna let go of you.
But you do have to let me leave.

37:45.596 --> 37:46.931
[doorbell rings]

37:47.014 --> 37:50.226
I'll see who that is.
Get your things. Then we'll go.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.440
I'm gonna call you every day.

37:57.149 --> 38:01.237
I'm not going to let you go. Ever.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.285
Cynthia. What do you want?

38:09.203 --> 38:11.122
Reddington paid me a visit.

38:11.831 --> 38:15.418
I really don't wanna hear
about Reddington right now.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.170
I think you'll wanna hear this.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.259
What are you doing here?

38:23.342 --> 38:25.386
We were on our way
to your sentencing hearing.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.138
Panabaker got it postponed.

38:27.221 --> 38:30.349
One month.
To allow me time to finish investigating.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.476
Why did the senator change her mind?

38:32.560 --> 38:36.105
I don't have the details,
but I know Reddington got involved.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.524
Does that mean you're back?
Tell me you're back.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.234
-I'm back.
-[Aram] You're back.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.321
You're back! Oh, Mr. Cooper!
Mr. Cooper's back!

38:44.113 --> 38:46.615
I could kiss you. You know what? I will.

38:46.699 --> 38:51.120
You understand, the office, the title,
the headaches, they are all yours!

38:51.203 --> 38:53.622
I tried to make you proud.
I stood up to Reddington.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.916
I showed the courage of my convictions.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.086
And he sent two fake JTTF agents
who trampled all over them.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.547
My convictions and me.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.884
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm back only as an agent.

39:04.967 --> 39:08.804
Unless and until we can figure out
who set me up, you're still the boss.

39:08.888 --> 39:14.560
Uh, okay, but you can tell me what to do.
I'll pretend to boss you into doing it.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.937
No. I just need to show results.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.358
Don't worry.
This time, you won't be working alone.

39:20.441 --> 39:23.069
We're gonna find your blackmailer.
All of us.

39:35.373 --> 39:39.043
<i>âª If you have ghosts... âª</i>

39:40.294 --> 39:44.465
There's no more peaceful sound
than the quiet of a home

39:44.548 --> 39:48.594
with a family tucked safely
under the covers and fast asleep.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.555
I envy you, Harold.

39:53.099 --> 39:56.310
I'm not sure how safe anyone is
with you in the house.

39:56.894 --> 40:01.107
Nonsense. I'm a guardian angel
and an angel of death,

40:01.190 --> 40:04.318
all rolled into
one fiercely protective package.

40:05.319 --> 40:08.697
Thank you. For the look
on Agnes's face when I told her.

40:10.282 --> 40:12.326
Now we have a month to figure this out.

40:16.956 --> 40:22.002
I came here to tell you that from now on,
I won't be working with the task force.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.879
On this case or any other.

40:24.588 --> 40:25.506
Aram.

40:26.549 --> 40:29.927
He leaves me no choice. I don't trust him.

40:30.010 --> 40:33.681
That's ironic, because you won't find
a more trustworthy soul on this planet.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.767
And he has you fooled, Harold.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.353
Because he deceived me.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.023
The sort of deceit
that gets people killed.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.609
Was it? Or...

40:46.735 --> 40:49.864
did he give you a taste of
what you give us and you didn't like it

40:50.489 --> 40:51.866
any more than we do?

40:53.325 --> 40:56.036
I have to operate the way I do.

40:56.954 --> 41:01.125
I give, but I get.
And nine times out of 10,

41:01.208 --> 41:06.338
my get is the very thing that enables me
to give you what you need.

41:06.422 --> 41:10.634
As I explained to Aram today,
that's why we need to trust you,

41:10.718 --> 41:12.595
even when you're not forthcoming with us.

41:13.804 --> 41:18.559
For our team to work, one side needs to
adhere to rules, be held accountable.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.270
That's our role as FBI agents.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.983
I forgot that
and nearly went to jail for it.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.612
Don't be too hard on yourself.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.531
I won't, if you won't be too hard on Aram.

41:33.866 --> 41:37.286
Give him another chance.
He's new to the job. He'll learn.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.664
He's also my boss, so I have to back him.

41:43.459 --> 41:44.376
We'll see.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.088
I'll consider your words.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.719
When you're done considering,
turn off the light.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.722
Lock the door behind you.

42:00.976 --> 42:03.979
-Good night, Raymond.
-Good night, Harold.
