WEBVTT

00:07.500 --> 00:09.333
THIS ISN'T GOING
WELL, IS IT?

00:09.333 --> 00:10.917
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
WHO YOU ASK.

00:10.917 --> 00:13.458
YEAH. IF YOU'RE
AN ENRAGED PARENT
WITH A MISGUIDED AGENDA,

00:13.458 --> 00:15.333
IT'S GOING GREAT.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.583
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
SUPERINTENDENT,

00:16.583 --> 00:19.625
BUT I DON'T RECALL
THE BOARD OF ED
PASSING ANY RULE

00:19.625 --> 00:22.792
THAT ALLOWS A LUNATIC TO
START HANDING OUT
DEATH SENTENCES

00:22.792 --> 00:24.959
JUST BECAUSE ONE OF OUR KIDS
ACTED LIKE A KID!

00:24.959 --> 00:27.917
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

00:27.917 --> 00:30.667
AS I'VE MENTIONED,

00:30.667 --> 00:31.917
I'VE STRONGLY URGED
PRINCIPAL GREEN

00:31.917 --> 00:35.417
TO RECONSIDER HIS DECISION,

00:35.417 --> 00:37.041
BUT AS MUCH AS I WISH
IT WEREN'T SO,

00:37.041 --> 00:39.333
PRINCIPAL GREEN
HAS FINAL SAY

00:39.333 --> 00:43.708
IN ALL CAPESIDE HIGH
DISCIPLINARY MATTERS!

00:43.708 --> 00:45.625
DR. FIELDING,
DR. FIELDING, MAY I?

00:45.625 --> 00:46.250
OH, YES, PLEASE.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.250
PLEASE. MR. CAUFIELD.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.542
DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF
A MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY?

00:50.542 --> 00:51.625
YES.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.208
ARE GOING TO LET
THE PERSONAL PREJUDICES

00:53.208 --> 00:56.583
OF AN OUTSIDER
RUIN MY SON'S FUTURE?

00:56.583 --> 00:58.875
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.
I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.041
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

01:01.041 --> 01:03.375
THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN
BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION.

01:03.375 --> 01:06.417
THIS IS A PTA MEETING,
YOUNG LADY,

01:06.417 --> 01:07.667
NOT A PEP RALLY.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.041
NOW, YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR SEAT, PLEASE.

01:10.041 --> 01:11.792
ISN'T ANYONE GOING
TO DEFEND PRINCIPAL GREEN

01:11.792 --> 01:13.375
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT HE'S DONE?

01:13.375 --> 01:16.041
MISS POTTER, MY SON
TELLS ME THAT YOU
ARE THE ONE

01:16.041 --> 01:17.250
WHOSE MURAL
WAS DESTROYED.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.375
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME, OK?

01:19.375 --> 01:20.417
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

01:20.417 --> 01:22.208
WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH
IS THE SCARE TACTICS

01:22.208 --> 01:26.208
OF A MAN WHOSE EXTREMISM
AND NOTIONS OF JUSTICE

01:26.208 --> 01:30.458
ARE BETTER SUITED
FOR URBAN WAR ZONES

01:30.458 --> 01:32.041
THAN OUR CIVILIZED
COMMUNITY.

01:32.041 --> 01:33.250
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY
WHAT I THINK YOU SAID.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.583
WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT

01:34.583 --> 01:40.291
IF THIS EDUCATOR
WERE DOING HIS JOB
IN ANY CAPACITY,

01:40.291 --> 01:41.708
NONE OF US WOULD
HAVE TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.

01:41.708 --> 01:45.166
AND IF YOU WERE DOING
YOUR JOB AS A PARENT,
MR. CAUFIELD,

01:45.166 --> 01:47.375
MAYBE YOUR SON WOULD
STILL BE IN SCHOOL
RIGHT NOW.

01:47.375 --> 01:51.083
HE HAS A FILE
IN THE GUIDANCE OFFICE
OVER AN INCH THICK.

01:51.083 --> 01:52.583
[APPLAUSE]

01:53.875 --> 01:55.333
LOOK, PRINCIPAL GREEN
IS A FAIR MAN.

01:55.333 --> 01:58.583
I'M SURE HE SEEMS
THAT WAY TO YOU, DEAR,

01:58.583 --> 02:00.750
AND TO MAYBE SOME
OF THE OTHER STUDENTS,

02:00.750 --> 02:01.792
WHOSE FAMILIES DON'T
EMBR--

02:01.792 --> 02:03.917
DON'T WHAT?

02:03.917 --> 02:06.041
DON'T EMBRACE THE VALUES
THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY--

02:06.041 --> 02:07.083
[SHOUTING]

02:07.083 --> 02:09.125
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HER FAMILY!

02:09.125 --> 02:09.792
[GAVEL BANGS]

02:09.792 --> 02:12.375
PEOPLE! THAT'S ENOUGH!

02:15.792 --> 02:17.875
AS OF THIS FRIDAY AT 3:00,

02:17.875 --> 02:21.625
IF PRINCIPAL GREEN HAS NOT
REDUCED MATT CAUFIELD'S
EXPULSION

02:21.625 --> 02:24.125
TO A MORE
REASONABLE SENTENCE,

02:24.125 --> 02:26.125
I WILL ASK HIM TO TENDER
HIS RESIGNATION.

02:26.125 --> 02:28.542
[CHEERING
AND APPLAUSE]

02:28.542 --> 02:29.834
Fielding:
THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED!

02:29.834 --> 02:31.959
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.959
DID WHAT I THINK
JUST HAPPENED HAPPEN?

02:33.959 --> 02:36.792
FIELDING'S GOING
TO RAILROAD GREEN
INTO CHANGING HIS RULING.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.708
EITHER THAT
OR OUT OF TOWN.

02:38.708 --> 02:41.000
OK. LET'S GO.

03:28.333 --> 03:32.166
HE'LL BE EXPECTING
GREEN'S RESIGNATION.

03:32.166 --> 03:35.458
FOR NOW THIS IS
SHERRY EISLER OF WKWB

03:35.458 --> 03:37.458
REPORTING FROM
DOWNTOWN CAPESIDE.

03:41.959 --> 03:44.333
HELLO, SHERRY.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.458
MISS LEERY.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.458
I MEAN GALE.
IT'S--IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU.

03:47.458 --> 03:48.500
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.125
SO DO YOU.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.458
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS
ON MAKING FIELD REPORTER.

03:52.458 --> 03:55.041
THAT'S A LONG WAY FROM
THE SHY INTERN THAT I HIRED.

03:55.041 --> 03:57.000
WELL, I COULD SAY
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.625
THE NEW GENERATION
OF FEMALE REPORTERS
WOULD BE NOWHERE

03:59.625 --> 04:01.500
WITHOUT VETERAN
TRAILBLAZERS LIKE
YOURSELF.

04:03.708 --> 04:05.000
SO, UH, WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.083
YOU WERE INSIDE THERE.
DIDN'T YOU SEE?

04:07.083 --> 04:09.208
I SAW A BUNCH
OF OUT OF CONTROL PARENTS,

04:09.208 --> 04:10.792
WHICH, FOR THIS TOWN,
IS HARDLY NEWS.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.458
MAYBE, BUT WHAT
ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL
EXPELLING A KID

04:13.458 --> 04:14.959
FOR THE REST
OF THE YEAR?

04:14.959 --> 04:16.208
HE SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL WHACKO TO ME.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.583
COME ON, SHERRY.
WE GOTTA MOVE.

04:17.583 --> 04:18.959
AH, WE GOT TO GET
GOING.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.416
GOT A DEADLINE TO MAKE.

04:20.416 --> 04:23.166
YOU REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.000
OH. IT WAS GREAT
SEEING YOU, GALE.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.166
HMM. YOU, TOO, SHERRY.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.708
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE
WAS SO UNJUST,

04:31.708 --> 04:33.458
NOT TO MENTION
PERSONALLY DEMORALIZING.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.125
YOU KNOW HOW
THIS SYSTEM WORKS, JO.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.166
CONVICTS,
MENTAL DEFECTIVES,

04:36.166 --> 04:37.583
AND PEOPLE UNDER
THE AGE OF 18

04:37.583 --> 04:40.458
ARE ROUTINELY DENIED
THE CHANCE TO
PARTICIPATE

04:40.458 --> 04:43.333
IN DECISIONS
THAT AFFECT THEIR
EVERYDAY LIVES.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.959
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS
ALL THE GREASE.

04:45.959 --> 04:49.250
I MEAN, ALL THESE IDIOTS
RANT AND RAVE ABOUT
LOW TEST SCORES.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.166
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE

04:52.166 --> 04:53.959
JUST SIT BACK
AND MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.041
TRUE. HAPPY, SATISFIED
PEOPLE RARELY ATTEND

04:55.041 --> 04:57.166
EMERGENCY PTA MEETINGS.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.625
AND TEENAGERS, I MEAN,
COME ON.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.166
THEY'D HAVE TO BE COAXED
AND PRODDED

05:00.166 --> 05:02.208
BEFORE THEY'D ACTUALLY
SET DOWN THEIR PLAY STATIONS,
TURN OFF TRL,

05:02.208 --> 05:04.708
AND DO SOMETHING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

05:04.708 --> 05:05.625
YOU SAID IT, SISTER.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.959
SO WHO'S GOING
TO RALLY THE TROOPS?

05:08.959 --> 05:11.250
OBVIOUSLY NOBODY.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.959
YOU COULD.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.583
HA! YEAH, JOEY POTTER
AGAINST THE SYSTEM.

05:14.583 --> 05:17.750
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,
PAINT ANOTHER MURAL?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.125
THAT'LL HELP.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.750
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I BOTHERED TO GO.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.959
IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.500
THERE WERE BARELY
ANY STUDENTS THERE,

05:23.500 --> 05:25.708
AND I GOT 2 SENTENCES OUT
BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED.

05:25.708 --> 05:28.125
JOEY, YOU CAN'T JUST
EXPECT PEOPLE TO RALLY
AROUND A CAUSE

05:28.125 --> 05:30.041
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

05:30.041 --> 05:31.875
THEY NEED LEADERSHIP.
THEY NEED--

05:31.875 --> 05:33.166
THAT'S WHAT PACEY SAID.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.041
PACEY?

05:34.041 --> 05:35.500
WHAT KIND OF A NAME
IS PACEY?

05:35.500 --> 05:38.166
I THING YOU'RE GOING
TO WANT TO SEE THIS.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.417
I'M ON THE PHONE.

05:39.417 --> 05:41.792
NO, REALLY. I THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO SEE THIS.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.000
Reporter: SAFE SCHOOLS,
BUT AT WHAT COST?

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
CONCERNED PARENTS DEMANDED
ACTIONS AND ANSWERS TONIGHT

05:47.000 --> 05:50.333
FROM CAPESIDE SCHOOL
SUPERINTENDENT BYRON FIELDING.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.500
THE UPROAR STARTED
WHEN A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL

05:52.500 --> 05:55.625
PAINTED A MURAL THAT WAS
INTENDED TO BRING UNITY.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.333
INSTEAD, ALL IT BROUGHT
WAS DISCORD

05:58.333 --> 06:00.500
AND THE POTENTIAL
RESIGNATION

06:00.500 --> 06:03.041
OF A HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL
UNDER SIEGE.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.000
HOWARD GREEN HAS THUS FAR
REFUSED TO COMMENT PUBLICLY

06:06.000 --> 06:11.959
ON HIS CONTROVERSIAL
DECISION TO EXPEL
MATT CAUFIELD, A SENIOR,

06:11.959 --> 06:15.750
ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING
THE SO-CALLED UNITY MURAL

06:15.750 --> 06:18.834
AND FIGHTING WITH ANOTHER
BOY WHO TOOK EXCEPTION
TO THE PRANK.

06:18.834 --> 06:22.041
THE OTHER BOY WAS LET OFF
WITH ONLY COMMUNITY SERVICE,

06:22.041 --> 06:25.542
LEADING SOME
IN THIS COMMUNITY
TO QUESTION GREEN'S MOTIVES

06:25.542 --> 06:29.208
AND WONDER WHETHER HE'S LET
SOME KIND OF PERSONAL AGENDA

06:29.208 --> 06:30.708
AFFECT HIS JUDGMENT.

06:30.708 --> 06:34.333
JOEY POTTER, THE GIRL
WHO PAINTED THE MURAL,

06:34.333 --> 06:36.166
WAS PRESENT
AT TONIGHT'S MEETING

06:36.166 --> 06:37.458
AND SUMMED IT UP BEST
WHEN SHE SAID THIS

06:37.458 --> 06:39.041
ABOUT CAUFIELD'S
HARSH PUNISHMENT.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.125
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.291
THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN
BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION.

06:43.291 --> 06:44.792
I NEVER SAID THAT.

06:44.792 --> 06:45.792
WE BELIEVE YOU, SIS.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.625
SHERRY EISLER,
WKWB REPORTING...

06:47.625 --> 06:50.208
I MEAN, I SAID IT,
BUT NOT IN THAT CONTEXT.

06:50.208 --> 06:51.834
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T FAIR.
THIS--

06:51.834 --> 06:53.500
NO ONE IS EVER GOING
TO GIVE ME THE CHANCE

06:53.500 --> 06:54.375
TO SAY EVERYTHING
THAT I WANT TO SAY.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.500
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THEY WON'T.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.583
NOT UNLESS YOU STAND UP
AND DEMAND TO BE HEARD,

06:59.583 --> 07:02.083
SHOW THEM YOU WON'T
BE IGNORED.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.625
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

07:04.917 --> 07:08.500
WELL, NORMA RAE, LOOKS LIKE
YOU TOOK MY ADVICE AFTER ALL.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
AND WHAT ADVICE WAS THAT?

07:09.500 --> 07:12.250
THIS MEETING.
RALLYING THE TROOPS.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.333
I HAVE TO SAY,
THIS IS A BIG STEP
FORWARD FOR YOU.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.000
I MEAN, I'M KNOWN AS
THE CAPESIDE CRUSADER
FAR AND WIDE,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.166
BREAKING DOWN
SEXUAL STEREOTYPES,
ERADICATING ROGUE TEACHERS,

07:19.166 --> 07:22.417
BUT YOU, YOU'RE DEFINITELY MORE
THE REBEL WITHOUT
THE CAUSE TYPE.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.834
SO, LOOK, I JUST
WANTED TO SAY

07:24.834 --> 07:28.000
DON'T HESITATE TO ASK
FOR ANY HELP THAT YOU
MIGHT NEED,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.250
SEEING THAT THIS WHOLE THING
WAS MY IDEA IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.917
YOU WERE ENCOURAGING,
YES, PACEY,

07:32.917 --> 07:34.625
BUT THIS MEETING
WAS HARDLY YOUR IDEA.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.625
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANT TO PLAY,
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

07:36.625 --> 07:39.125
IF YOU WANT TO PRETEND
LIKE YOU DEVISED THIS
WHOLE CALL TO ACTION--

07:39.125 --> 07:40.166
I DIDN'T.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.792
I'M ALL OUT.

07:43.792 --> 07:44.125
ME, TOO.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.625
AHEM!

07:45.625 --> 07:47.291
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GUYS HAVE--

07:47.291 --> 07:49.625
YOU GUYS
HAVE NEVER MET.

07:49.625 --> 07:50.250
UM, PACEY, THIS IS A.J.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.291
A.J., THIS IS PACEY.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.000
RIGHT, THE ONE
WITH THE PECULIAR NAME.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.792
HOW YOU DOING?

07:54.792 --> 07:57.750
A.J. CAME DOWN TO HELP US
RALLY UP THE TROOPS.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.625
YEAH. TO GIVE CAPESIDE
A SMALL TASTE OF SOME

07:59.625 --> 08:01.458
TRIED AND TRUE
COLLEGE PROTEST ACTION.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.291
QUICK!

08:03.291 --> 08:05.417
GREEN'S COMING INSIDE,

08:05.417 --> 08:06.750
AND YOU GUYS
GOT TO SEE THIS.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.417
[CHANTING]

08:13.625 --> 08:14.667
GREEN TOO EXTREME!
GREEN TOO EXTREME!

08:16.625 --> 08:18.583
GREEN TOO EXTREME!
GREEN TOO EXTREME!

08:18.583 --> 08:20.667
GREEN TOO EXTREME!
GREEN TOO EXTREME!

08:20.667 --> 08:23.250
GREEN TOO EXTREME!

08:23.250 --> 08:24.792
GREEN TOO EXTREME!
GREEN TOO EXTREME!

08:27.708 --> 08:29.333
JOEY.

08:29.333 --> 08:29.708
AFTER YOU.

08:43.041 --> 08:47.000
Reporter: CONCERNED PARENTS
SHOWED UP AT CAPESIDE HIGH TODAY

08:47.000 --> 08:50.458
TO EXPRESS THEIR OUTRAGE
AT A PRINCIPAL WHO
MANY THINK

08:50.458 --> 08:52.166
HAS GONE TOO FAR.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.333
THANKS FOR HELPING OUT
TONIGHT, HONEY.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.458
DON'T THANK ME.
THANK DAD.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.500
HE'S THE ONE WHO INDENTURED ME
TO THIS SERVITUDE.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.959
NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.

09:00.959 --> 09:03.291
I MUST SAY,
THIS RESTAURANT STUFF,

09:03.291 --> 09:06.375
IT'S A LOT MORE WORK
THAN I EXPECTED.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.333
WELL, I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
BE HERE ANY SOONER.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.500
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT
MEETING AT JOEY'S
TONIGHT?

09:10.500 --> 09:13.291
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.291
TOTALLY CONFIDENT.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.375
TOTALLY INSPIRED.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.583
YOU'RE PROUD OF HER.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.000
YEAH.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.625
HOW CAN I NOT BE?

09:21.625 --> 09:23.542
I MEAN, SHE'S FINALLY
STANDING UP FOR HERSELF

09:23.542 --> 09:25.959
AND FIGHTING BACK
THE WAY I ALWAYS KNEW SHE COULD.

09:25.959 --> 09:26.875
YOU KNOW,

09:28.875 --> 09:29.750
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
A PART OF THAT.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.625
SHE'S ORGANIZING
AN ACTION TOMORROW

09:32.625 --> 09:35.041
OUTSIDE THE SUPERINTENDENT'S
OFFICE.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.250
WELL, SHE'S GOT
A TOUGH ROAD
IN FRONT OF HER.

09:36.250 --> 09:39.834
ESPECIALLY WITH
THAT SPOKESMODEL
TURNED JOURNALIST

09:39.834 --> 09:41.500
MISREPRESENTING
HER STORY.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.625
Sherry: BYRON FIELDING--

09:42.625 --> 09:43.583
[TV CLICKS OFF]

09:43.583 --> 09:44.959
YOU KNOW
WHAT KILLS ME

09:44.959 --> 09:46.625
IS TO SEE
AN IMPORTANT STORY

09:46.625 --> 09:48.792
DONE BADLY SIMPLY
BECAUSE THE PERSON
COVERING IT

09:48.792 --> 09:50.500
HAS NO IDEA
HOW TO DECIPHER TRUTH
FROM POPULAR OPINION.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.041
SOUNDS LIKE YOU MISS IT.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.667
YEAH, I'D BE LYING
IF I SAID I DIDN'T,

09:55.667 --> 09:57.917
BUT, HEY, I GOT
THIS PLACE NOW.

09:57.917 --> 09:58.750
ONWARD AND UPWARD.

10:02.667 --> 10:03.792
WHAT IF...

10:06.917 --> 10:09.542
YOU TRIED
TO TELL THE REAL STORY
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:11.583 --> 10:13.125
RELIVE MY GLORY DAYS
AS A FIELD REPORTER?

10:13.125 --> 10:16.250
ALL YOU WOULD NEED
TO GET BACK IN THE GAME
IS A CAMERA.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.083
AND A CREW.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.417
IN THESE DAYS
OF DIGITAL VIDEO,
A CREW IS ONE PERSON.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.834
OH, AND JUST WHO WOULD
MY ONE PERSON BE?

10:24.166 --> 10:25.792
YOU DO HAVE ONE
INDENTURED SERVANT
AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.250
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.792
EVEN IF WE DID THIS
AND WE DID IT RIGHT,

10:33.792 --> 10:36.291
THERE'S NO PROMISE
THAT THE STATION
WOULD RUN IT.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.792
THEY'VE MADE IT CLEAR
MANY TIMES OVER

10:37.792 --> 10:38.750
THAT MY SERVICES ARE
PAST THEIR PRIME.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.208
WELL, WE'RE INTO DOING
FOR THE STATION.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.542
WE'RE DOING IT FOR YOU.

10:44.542 --> 10:46.834
AND FOR PRINCIPAL GREEN

10:46.834 --> 10:48.083
AND FOR JOEY.

10:48.083 --> 10:51.875
WE BARELY HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE
TO FILL A SOFTBALL TEAM,

10:51.875 --> 10:53.542
LET ALONE CHANGE THE WORLD.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.291
ROME WASN'T BUILT
IN A DAY, JOEY.

10:55.291 --> 10:56.166
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.667
HOT COFFEE IS GREAT
FOR MORALE.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.834
NO PROBLEM.
SO WHERE'S JOEY?

11:00.834 --> 11:03.959
SHE'S GETTING READY
FOR HER CLOSE-UP.

11:03.959 --> 11:06.333
SHE'S GREAT,
ISN'T SHE?

11:06.333 --> 11:09.166
A BORN LEADER.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.000
AH, SHE'S A PEACH,
ALL RIGHT.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.750
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
A SERIES OF QUESTIONS

11:12.750 --> 11:14.208
ABOUT THE NATURE
OF THE PROTEST

11:14.208 --> 11:15.208
AND WHERE THE MOVEMENT
CAME FROM,

11:15.208 --> 11:16.500
AND THEN I THINK
WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE--

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
GALE! WHAT'S THIS?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.792
I'M DOING A STORY
ON THE GREEN SITUATION.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.166
FOR CABLE?

11:22.166 --> 11:23.542
I DON'T KNOW.
TRUTH BE TOLD,

11:23.542 --> 11:26.834
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
SUBMITTING IT TO ROGER
AT THE STATION.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.417
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

11:28.417 --> 11:30.834
JOEY, I WOULD LOVE
TO GET A FOLLOW-UP
INTERVIEW WITH YOU.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.500
IN YOUR FROSTED
BLONDE DREAMS, BARBIE.

11:38.708 --> 11:41.041
YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS
TOO HARD ON HER?

11:41.041 --> 11:41.875
FELT ABOUT RIGHT TO ME.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.333
WHAT IS IT?

11:55.333 --> 11:57.333
SUPERINTENDENT FIELDING
WANTS TO SEE YOU.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.500
ME?

11:59.500 --> 12:00.875
THE FIRST SIGNS
OF RESISTANCE FALLING.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.208
WHY DON'T I GET
THAT FEELING?

12:04.208 --> 12:07.166
BECAUSE FIELDING
IS AN UNSCRUPULOUS,
INEFFECTUAL JERK

12:07.166 --> 12:10.500
WHO CARES MORE ABOUT
JOB SECURITY THAN ABOUT WHAT
ANYBODY OUT HERE THINKS.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.708
HE'S ONLY GOING
TO THREATEN YOU, JO.

12:11.708 --> 12:14.625
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
GO IN THERE.

12:15.417 --> 12:19.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.250
I'D GO.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.333
MS. JOSEPHINE POTTER,
CORRECT?

12:35.333 --> 12:36.875
YES.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.166
HAVE A SEAT.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.208
I ASSUME YOU KNOW
WHO I AM.

12:43.208 --> 12:46.375
THE MAN WHO SHOWS UP
FOR FOOTBALL GAMES
AND GRADUATION.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.000
I APPRECIATE
A SENSE OF HUMOR,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.834
THOUGH I PREFER TO THINK
OF MY INVOLVEMENT IN YOUR LIFE

12:51.834 --> 12:53.417
AS A TOUCH MORE PERSONAL
THAN THAT.

12:53.417 --> 12:59.000
I HEAR YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT DISSONANT CLAMORING
OUTSIDE.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.708
THAT TRUE?

13:00.708 --> 13:02.291
WELL, PARENTS
CAN PICKET A SCHOOL,

13:02.291 --> 13:04.583
STUDENTS CAN PICKET
A SUPERINTENDENT'S
OFFICE.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.500
FAIR ENOUGH.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.875
AND JUST WHAT IS IT
YOU INTEND TO ACCOMPLISH

13:07.875 --> 13:11.125
WITH THIS FIRST AMENDMENT
DISPLAY?

13:11.125 --> 13:14.792
WELL, IT'S OUR BELIEF
THAT PRINCIPAL GREEN
WAS RIGHT

13:14.792 --> 13:16.125
IN EXPELLING
MATT CAUFIELD,

13:16.125 --> 13:18.291
AND HE SHOULDN'T BE
FORCED INTO CHANGING
HIS RULING

13:18.291 --> 13:20.208
SIMPLY BECAUSE--
NO ONE'S FORCING HIM.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.208
PARDON ME, DR. FIELDING,

13:23.208 --> 13:26.250
BUT YOU THREATENED
TO ASK FOR HIS
RESIGNATION--

13:26.250 --> 13:28.458
THAT WASN'T A THREAT.

13:28.458 --> 13:31.125
THAT  WAS A DIRECT REQUEST.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.208
AS A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE STUDENT BODY,
I'M TELLING YOU

13:33.208 --> 13:36.250
WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO PRINCIPAL GREEN
IS WRONG.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.500
AS FAR AS I KNOW,

13:37.500 --> 13:38.875
ALL YOU REPRESENT IS
THAT MEAGER HANDFUL
OF STUDENTS

13:38.875 --> 13:40.959
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.
AND THAT'S IT.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.291
WELL, THERE'S
MORE OF US.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.417
OH, REALLY?

13:46.417 --> 13:48.792
YEAH! A LOT MORE.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.583
IN FACT, WE HAVE
A--A STUDENT-SIGNED
PETITION

13:50.583 --> 13:53.125
WITH 300 SIGNATURES.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.667
300?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.208
MM-HMM. AND THERE'S
GOING TO BE A RALLY
TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:56.208 --> 13:59.333
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK
THE CROWD LAST NIGHT
WAS VOCAL,

13:59.333 --> 14:00.542
YOU JUST WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

14:00.542 --> 14:03.875
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.583
MAKE NO MISTAKE,
DR. FIELDING,

14:05.583 --> 14:08.000
THERE'S A VOICE
THAT DOESN'T AGREE WITH
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.834
AND THAT VOICE
WILL BE HEARD.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.458
I'M ALL EARS.

14:11.458 --> 14:14.959
NOW, I SUGGEST THAT YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS HURRY
BACK TO SCHOOL

14:14.959 --> 14:17.834
BEFORE THAT PRINCIPAL
YOU LOVE SO DEARLY

14:17.834 --> 14:21.458
HAS TO SERVE YOU WITH DETENTION
FOR CUTTING CLASS.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.750
WHO'S CUTTING CLASS?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.708
I'M OUT SICK
WITH A COLD.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.291
DAWSON, MRS. LEERY.

14:37.291 --> 14:39.375
TO WHAT DO I OWE
A LATE AFTERNOON
HONOR?

14:39.375 --> 14:40.959
WE'RE HERE
FOR YOUR INTERVIEW.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.875
INTERVIEW?
WHAT INTERVIEW?

14:42.875 --> 14:44.959
FOR THE STORY THAT I'M HOPING
TO RUN ON CHANNEL 3

14:44.959 --> 14:47.000
ABOUT THE SITUATION
IN THE COMMUNITY

14:47.000 --> 14:49.166
AS A RESULT OF
MATT CAUFIELD'S
EXPULSION.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.792
I TALKED TO NIKKI
THIS AFTERNOON.
SHE SAID IT WAS OK.

14:51.792 --> 14:55.000
I JUST WANTED YOU TO
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO SPEAK,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.208
FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.625
I KNOW MY SIDE OF THE STORY.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.542
I'M SORRY, BUT MY DAUGHTER
MISINFORMED YOU.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.959
MR, GREEN,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

15:04.959 --> 15:07.875
PEOPLE SEVERELY
MISINTERPRETED YOU
AND THIS ENTIRE SITUATION.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.375
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT A CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS?

15:10.375 --> 15:13.625
IT'S NOT MY JOB TO PROVE
TO PEOPLE THAT I'M
A FAIR AND DECENT MAN.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.667
IF THEY DON'T KNOW THAT
BY NOW,

15:15.667 --> 15:18.291
SOME SOUND BITE
ON A TELEVISION SHOW
IS NOT GOING TO HELP.

15:18.291 --> 15:22.333
WHEN YOU SEE
A GOOD FIGHT,
GET IN IT.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.166
DR. KING'S WORDS,

15:23.166 --> 15:25.542
BUT YOUR LESSON
TO ME.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.208
THIS IS NOT A GOOD FIGHT,
NIKKI.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.375
THE MORE I TRY
TO PROVE MYSELF,

15:29.375 --> 15:31.667
THE MORE I EMPOWER
THIS INSANE NOTION

15:31.667 --> 15:36.166
THAT I'M AN ENRAGED MAN
ON A BIGOTED TIRADE.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.625
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T
GRANT YOU THE INTERVIEW.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.750
HAVE A NICE DAY.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.500
I'M JUST SAYING
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN NICE

15:46.500 --> 15:48.834
TO HAVE A LITTLE
HEADS UP BEFORE YOU
INVENTED A PETITION

15:48.834 --> 15:50.291
WITH OVER
300 SIGNATURES.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.291
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE 300 STUDENTS
AT OUR SCHOOL.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.667
SHE HAD TO BLUFF.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.583
HOW ELSE WAS
SHE GOING TO GET
THE GUY'S RESPECT?

15:55.583 --> 15:57.125
RIGHT. LOOK, IT'LL
BE FINE, PACEY.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.417
JUST TELL US WHAT WE'RE DOING
TO GET PEOPLE TO COME
TO THE RALLY.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.792
THAT BLUFF'S GOING
TO BE A LITTLE BIT
HARDER TO PULL OFF.

16:01.792 --> 16:02.875
A PETITION IS
EASY ENOUGH TO FAKE.

16:02.875 --> 16:05.041
YOU JUST CONVINCE KIDS
THAT YOU'RE CAMPAIGNING

16:05.041 --> 16:06.834
FOR EXTRA CHOCOLATE MILK
DAYS AT THE CAFETERIA,

16:06.834 --> 16:08.000
BUT FOR A RALLY,
YOU GOT TO PRODUCE
ACTUAL BODIES.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.708
THOSE ARE PROBLEMS.
WE NEED SOLUTIONS.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.125
ALL RIGHT,
WHICH WE HAVE.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.000
SEE, PACEY, HERE,
SAID THINK INTERNET,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.792
SO JACK IS RIGHT NOW
PUTTING AN ANNOUNCEMENT

16:15.792 --> 16:18.583
ON THE CAPESIDE WEBSITE,
AND ANDY IS GETTING WORD OUT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

16:18.583 --> 16:22.291
OK, IF YOU DON'T COME,
THEN YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT ME PARTICIPATING

16:22.291 --> 16:25.125
WHEN IT COMES TO ME PUTTING
ALL THOSE LITTLE NAMES
AND FACES TOGETHER

16:25.125 --> 16:26.625
IN THE YEARBOOK, OK?

16:26.625 --> 16:30.917
GREAT. HA! PERSONAL TOUCH
IS ALWAYS NICE WHEN
IT COMES TO BLACKMAIL.

16:30.917 --> 16:34.750
OH, I SHOULD CALL--HELLO?

16:34.750 --> 16:36.959
HELLO? OH, NO.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

16:36.959 --> 16:37.959
BESSIE!

16:37.959 --> 16:38.959
YEAH?

16:38.959 --> 16:40.708
OH, FOR YOU.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.458
HELLO.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.291
JOEY!

16:44.291 --> 16:46.166
WE DESIGNED
A NEW FLYER,

16:46.166 --> 16:47.708
FOR YOUR APPROVAL OF COURSE.

16:47.708 --> 16:50.041
GREAT. GREAT.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.917
GOOD, 'CAUSE I ALREADY
ORDERED 500 COPIES.

16:51.917 --> 16:52.750
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO PAY FOR THAT?

16:52.750 --> 16:55.000
WE'RE NOT, ACTUALLY.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.333
PACEY MANAGED TO
CONVINCE A CIVIL-MINDED
COPY SHOP OWNER

16:57.333 --> 16:59.166
TO RUN THEM FOR FREE.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.125
HE DID?

17:01.125 --> 17:02.542
YES, HE DID.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.333
OK.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.875
OK, ATTENTION,
EVERYONE.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.750
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
WORKING VERY HARD,

17:09.750 --> 17:10.916
AND WE'RE ONLY 20 PEOPLE
RIGHT NOW,

17:10.916 --> 17:13.708
BUT BY TOMORROW NIGHT,
WE HAVE TO BE 200 AT LEAST,

17:13.708 --> 17:16.125
SO KEEP UP
THE HARD WORK.

17:16.125 --> 17:19.625
WE GOT MANY MILES TO GO
BEFORE WE CAN SLEEP.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.541
GREAT JOB.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.458
HEY!

17:25.208 --> 17:27.208
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE?

17:27.208 --> 17:29.291
YEAH. I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING IT NOW.

17:29.291 --> 17:33.542
WELL, BELIEVE IT,
'CAUSE IT'S HAPPENING.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.708
THANKS TO YOU.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.458
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
CONVINCED ME TO DO IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE

17:39.458 --> 17:40.375
AND YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE.

17:40.375 --> 17:43.625
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.125
YOU OK?

17:59.458 --> 18:00.875
OH, YEAH.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.291
YEAH. I THINK I'M
JUST GOING TO HANG
SOME OF THESE FLYERS UP.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.125
OK. I JUST GOT
A PHONE CALL.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.125
WHAT IS IT?

18:10.125 --> 18:11.917
SOME CONCERNED CITIZEN
WANTED ME TO KNOW

18:11.917 --> 18:14.208
THAT LETTING HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENTS USE MY PLACE
OF BUSINESS

18:14.208 --> 18:15.333
AS THEIR POINT OF ATTACK
AGAINST THE SYSTEM

18:15.333 --> 18:19.166
IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO KEEP
MY BUSINESS AFLOAT.

18:19.166 --> 18:19.750
I DON'T GET IT.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.834
YOU DON'T, DO YOU?

18:21.834 --> 18:24.417
YOU NEVER DO.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.917
LOOK, BESSIE,
IT WAS PROBABLY JUST

18:32.917 --> 18:34.041
A STUPID LITTLE PRANK,

18:34.041 --> 18:35.291
AND I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED

18:35.291 --> 18:36.834
IF MATT CAUFIELD
DID IT HIMSELF.

18:36.834 --> 18:39.333
BESS, RELAX. I'M--I'M
SURE IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.583
WHAT IF IT WASN'T
A PRANK?

18:40.583 --> 18:42.333
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO
ANTAGONIZE THE PEOPLE

18:42.333 --> 18:43.083
WHO HOLD THE MORTGAGE
ON THIS HOUSE.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.333
OR AT LEAST BODIE AND I CAN'T.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.417
WE'LL STILL BE LIVING HERE
WHEN YOU GO TO COLLEGE.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.542
SO I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO SIT AROUND
AND WAIT PATIENTLY

18:49.542 --> 18:50.917
UNTIL I GET OUT
OF THIS TOWN?

18:50.917 --> 18:52.750
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO CRITICIZE IT
OR EVEN CHANGE IT

18:52.750 --> 18:53.291
IN ANY WAY?

18:53.291 --> 18:55.333
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.875
LOOK, I CAN'T
STOP NOW, BESSIE.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.208
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

18:58.208 --> 19:00.125
JO, JO, NO ONE'S
ASKING YOU TO STOP.

19:00.125 --> 19:03.417
I THINK BESSIE JUST WANTS YOU
TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT
THE SITUATION.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.125
I AM BEING REALISTIC.

19:05.125 --> 19:07.208
SPENDING ALL THIS TIME
AND EFFORT DEFENDING A MAN

19:07.208 --> 19:09.250
WHO WON'T EVEN DEFEND HIMSELF.
HOW IS THAT REALISTIC?

19:09.250 --> 19:10.041
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.375
HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.667
YOU'RE SURE THIS KID
DOESN'T DESERVE ANOTHER CHANCE?

19:14.667 --> 19:16.375
EVERYONE AT SCHOOL
KNOWS THAT CAPESIDE HIGH

19:16.375 --> 19:19.375
IS A MUCH BETTER PLACE
WITHOUT MATT CAUFIELD.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.166
THE STUDENTS KNOW IT
AND THE TEACHERS KNOW IT.

19:21.166 --> 19:23.542
SO ALL THESE PARENTS,
THEY'RE JUST WRONG?

19:23.542 --> 19:25.083
YES. YOU WEREN'T
AT THAT MEETING.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.834
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
MR. CAUFIELD SAID, OK?

19:26.834 --> 19:28.333
HE'S GOT HIS OWN
PERSONAL AGENDA,

19:28.333 --> 19:30.583
AND I'M NOT JUST
TALKING ABOUT SAVING
HIS SON'S ASS.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.917
SHE MEANS ALL THESE
CONCERNED CITIZENS

19:34.917 --> 19:36.708
WOULDN'T BE FIGHTING
THIS DECISION SO HARD

19:36.708 --> 19:38.125
IF PRINCIPAL GREEN
WERE WHITE.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.667
THEY WOULD STILL
BE UPSET.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.166
UPSET, YEAH,
AND THEY MIGHT TRY
AND TAKE ACTION ABOUT IT,

19:44.166 --> 19:45.667
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.208
THERE WOULDN'T BE THIS LEVEL
OF ANGER AND HOSTILITY

19:48.208 --> 19:49.667
AND MISUNDERSTANDING,

19:49.667 --> 19:51.834
AND THEY CERTAINLY WOULDN'T
TRY AND THREATEN THE FAMILY

19:51.834 --> 19:54.542
OF SOME TEENAGE GIRL
TRYING TO SPEAK HER MIND.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.375
I GIVE UP.
JOEY, YOU WANT TO CHANGE

19:56.375 --> 19:59.792
THE WORLD FROM OUR LIVING ROOM,
FINE. WHATEVER.

20:13.208 --> 20:13.500
SORRY.

20:15.542 --> 20:16.834
IT'S OK.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.375
TOO BAD YOU'RE NOT
A PAYING GUEST.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.542
THIS SCENE
WOULD HAVE BEEN

20:20.542 --> 20:21.834
EVEN MORE
HEINOUSLY AWKWARD.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.917
LOOK, UH, THIS IS PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST TIME TO SAY THIS,

20:24.917 --> 20:27.250
BUT, UH...

20:28.583 --> 20:29.542
YOU'RE LEAVING?

20:29.542 --> 20:30.917
YEAH. I FIGURE SINCE
I'VE ALIENATED YOU

20:30.917 --> 20:32.959
FROM YOUR SISTER

20:32.959 --> 20:35.208
AND COMPLETELY UNDERMINED
THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY

20:35.208 --> 20:36.875
OF YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS,

20:36.875 --> 20:38.333
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.750
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
I MEAN WE JUST
STARTED.

20:43.708 --> 20:44.959
I COULD GIVE YOU
ANOTHER ROOM,

20:44.959 --> 20:45.959
MAYBE SOMETHING
WITHOUT NAUTICAL
WALLPAPER.

20:45.959 --> 20:49.208
NO, NO. I GOT TO GO.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.917
I GOT PAPERS TO WRITE.

20:50.917 --> 20:51.500
ACTUALLY, PAPERS TO GRADE.

20:54.417 --> 20:57.667
LISTEN, JO, YOU THINK
YOU NEED ME, BUT YOU DON'T.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.708
YOU'RE SURROUNDED
BY A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVE IN YOU.

21:00.708 --> 21:01.667
GOOD PEOPLE.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.125
SMART PEOPLE.

21:03.125 --> 21:05.542
I MEAN, EVEN PACEY
TURNED OUT TO BE
NOT SUCH A BAD GUY.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.417
WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

21:10.417 --> 21:14.083
WELL, I'M AN EXCELLENT
JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.667
I FOUND YOU, DIDN'T I?

21:24.083 --> 21:27.417
UH, PACEY, I THINK
YOU GOT THAT ONE COVERED.

21:27.417 --> 21:28.792
HURRICANE WON'T TAKE IT DOWN.

21:28.792 --> 21:31.125
HA HA.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.834
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER IF YOU
TALK ABOUT IT.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.834
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

21:35.834 --> 21:37.291
ABOUT WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.625
THERE'S NOTHING
BOTHERING ME.

21:39.625 --> 21:40.750
HA HA. FINE.

21:40.750 --> 21:42.542
FINE.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.250
I'M FINE.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.417
OK. SO I DO KINDA OF
HAVE A PROBLEM.

21:47.417 --> 21:49.667
YEAH, I NOTICED.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.458
IT'S THAT OBVIOUS, HUH?

21:52.458 --> 21:54.542
YEAH, IT'S BECOMING SO.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.542
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
AT ALL POSSIBLE TO,

21:58.542 --> 22:00.875
I DON'T KNOW,
PRETEND LIKE IT
WASN'T THAT OBVIOUS?

22:00.875 --> 22:06.375
WELL, ONLY IF WE PRETEND
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
ABOUT IT.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.875
YOU REALLY WANT TO
MAKE ME DO THAT?

22:12.875 --> 22:13.959
OK.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.959
HA. OK.

22:16.959 --> 22:19.792
UM, LET'S JUST SAY
FOR THE SAKE
OF ARGUMENT,

22:19.792 --> 22:24.458
THAT I HAD
GOTTEN MYSELF INTO
AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.708
THAT I HAD,
HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,

22:27.708 --> 22:30.333
FALLEN FOR
OR WAS IN THE PROCESS
OF FALLING FOR

22:30.333 --> 22:35.291
THE WORST POSSIBLE
PERSON THAT I COULD
EVER FALL FOR.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.542
WHAT WOULD YOU
TELL ME TO DO?

22:38.750 --> 22:42.375
WELL, I GUESS
I WOULD TELL YOU
THAT IMPOSSIBLE SITUATIONS

22:42.375 --> 22:44.667
ARE ONLY MADE BETTER
BY DOING SOMETHING
ABOUT THEM.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.500
SO I SHOULD JUST GO
AND DECLARE MYSELF
TO HER

22:47.500 --> 22:49.959
SO THAT SHE COULD
LAUGH IN MY FACE?

22:49.959 --> 22:51.000
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.500
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT'S HOW SHE'D REACT?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
WELL, I HAVE IT
ON PRETTY GOOD AUTHORITY

22:53.500 --> 22:55.333
THAT MY ROUGH CHARMS
DON'T REALLY REGISTER

22:55.333 --> 22:58.667
ON HER RAREFIED
ROMANTIC PALLET.

22:58.667 --> 22:59.875
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.208
I GOT DUCKIE
WRITTEN ALL OVER ME.

23:01.208 --> 23:02.208
DUCKIE?

23:02.208 --> 23:03.583
YEAH, DUCKIE.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.875
MOLLY RINGWALD'S
BEST FRIEND FROM
PRETTY IN PINK?

23:05.875 --> 23:07.792
THE GUY WHO
DEFINITELY DOES NOT
GET THE GIRL.

23:07.792 --> 23:09.959
YES, BUT HE MAKES THE GIRL
FEEL GOOD ABOUT HERSELF.

23:09.959 --> 23:14.583
HE DOES. HE STANDS BY HER
THROUGH INNUMERABLE
FASHION EMERGENCIES.

23:14.583 --> 23:16.875
HE HUMILIATES HIMSELF
BY LIP-SYNCING
IN A PUBLIC PLACE,

23:16.875 --> 23:18.083
AND HE TAKES HER
TO THE PROM.

23:18.083 --> 23:20.041
WHERE SHE PROMPTLY DUMPS
HIM FOR ANOTHER GUY.

23:20.041 --> 23:22.000
HA HA HA.

23:22.000 --> 23:22.625
ALL RIGHT.

23:22.625 --> 23:25.000
THE QUESTION IS, PACE,

23:25.000 --> 23:29.291
THIS...GIRL THAT YOU HAVE
DEVELOPED IMPOSSIBLE
FEELINGS FOR,

23:30.667 --> 23:32.667
ARE YOU GOING
TO STAND BY HER IN
A VERY DUCKIE-LIKE FASHION

23:32.667 --> 23:35.417
OR ARE YOU GOING TO LET
HURT FEELINGS AND PRIDE

23:35.417 --> 23:36.959
PREVENT YOU FROM BEING
THE FRIEND

23:36.959 --> 23:38.875
THAT YOU SO INNOCENTLY
PURPORT YOURSELF TO BE?

23:47.875 --> 23:50.041
[SIGHS]

23:51.917 --> 23:53.792
I GUESS IT JUST HURTS.
THAT'S ALL.

23:53.792 --> 23:57.250
WELL, THAT JUST MEANS
THAT IT ISN'T PRETEND ANYMORE.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.542
[SIGHS]

24:08.333 --> 24:09.625
MOM, WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

24:09.625 --> 24:12.250
IF GREEN WON'T TALK,
WHY ARE WE INTERVIEWING
FIELDING?

24:12.250 --> 24:14.041
BECAUSE THERE'S
2 SIDES TO EVERY STORY,

24:14.041 --> 24:16.417
AND IT'S NOT OUR JOB
TO EDITORIALIZE.

24:17.583 --> 24:18.500
WELL, I'M SORRY,

24:18.500 --> 24:19.834
BUT IT'S MY
EDITORIAL OPINION

24:19.834 --> 24:21.583
THAT THE WORLD'S HEARD ENOUGH
FROM THIS SIDE.

24:21.583 --> 24:22.291
HONEY, IF I DIDN'T
DO THIS INTERVIEW,

24:22.291 --> 24:23.458
I'D BE JUST LIKE
SHERRY,

24:23.458 --> 24:26.291
PICKING THE NEWS
THAT I WANT TO TELL.

24:26.291 --> 24:27.458
WELL, WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?

24:27.458 --> 24:29.667
EVERYONE ELSE DOES
THESE DAYS.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.041
NO, NOT THE BEST
JOURNALISTS.

24:31.041 --> 24:33.041
THE BEST ONES JUST ASK
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

24:33.041 --> 24:35.625
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THAT THE TRUTH
CAN SURFACE.

24:35.625 --> 24:37.083
[DOOR OPENS]

24:37.917 --> 24:40.250
DR. FIELDING WILL
SEE YOU NOW.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.708
WHAT WE'RE ASKING
PRINCIPAL GREEN TO DO

24:44.708 --> 24:46.959
IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE
REQUEST.

24:46.959 --> 24:50.375
SIMPLY READMIT ONE STUDENT
WHO MAY HAVE CAUSED
A LITTLE TROUBLE

24:50.375 --> 24:52.125
HERE OR THERE.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.667
YES, BUT MOST
OF MATT CAUFIELD'S
FELLOW STUDENTS

24:54.667 --> 24:56.500
SIDE WITH PRINCIPAL GREEN
ON THIS ONE.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.417
GREEN COULD OFFER
TO SHORTEN THE SCHOOL DAY

24:59.417 --> 25:00.542
BY 15 MINUTES,
THEY'D FOLLOW HIM ANYWHERE.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.667
THEY CAN MAKE
A LOT OF NOISE, THOUGH.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.834
THIS RALLY, FOR INSTANCE.

25:05.834 --> 25:09.500
THEY CAN RALLY ALL NIGHT
FOR ALL THE GOOD
IT'S GOING TO DO THEM.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.792
HOWARD GREEN HAS
UNTIL FRIDAY AT 3:00

25:13.333 --> 25:14.875
TO RESCIND HIS RULING

25:14.875 --> 25:18.000
OR ITS GOING TO BE
HIS LAST DAY AT CAPESIDE.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME
THAT FIRING PRINCIPAL GREEN

25:21.000 --> 25:24.834
IS AS EXTREME AS HIM
CHOOSING TO EXPEL
MATT CAUFIELD.

25:24.834 --> 25:29.583
NOW, ARE YOU REALLY SURE
THAT FIRING THEIR PRINCIPAL
IS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE STUDENTS?

25:29.583 --> 25:33.000
IT'S WHAT'S BEST
FOR THIS COMMUNITY.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.542
AH, AND THAT'S WHO
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE TO,
THE COMMUNITY?

25:37.959 --> 25:39.125
ULTIMATELY, YES.

25:39.125 --> 25:43.583
COULD I ASK YOU
TO READ SOMETHING
FOR ME, SIR?

25:43.583 --> 25:45.083
OF COURSE.

25:45.083 --> 25:48.083
COULD YOU PLEASE READ
LINE ITEM NUMBER ONE
ON THAT PAGE?

25:48.083 --> 25:50.583
AH...

25:50.583 --> 25:52.708
"I HEREBY DECLARE TO,
ABOVE ALL ELSE,

25:52.708 --> 25:55.792
"PROTECT AND SERVE
THE WELFARE OF EACH STUDENT

25:55.792 --> 25:58.917
IN THIS DISTRICT
TO THE BEST OF..."

25:58.917 --> 26:00.291
"MY ABILITY."

26:02.125 --> 26:03.417
WHAT IS THIS?

26:03.417 --> 26:07.500
A CONTRACT FOR CAPESIDE
SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS,

26:07.500 --> 26:10.041
THE ONE WHICH STATES
WHAT HE'S HIRED TO DO.

26:10.041 --> 26:13.208
IN FACT,
THAT IS YOUR SIGNATURE
ON THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE,

26:13.208 --> 26:15.083
DR. FIELDING, IS IT NOT?

26:15.083 --> 26:16.041
YES. YES, IT IS.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.500
SO WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING
IS A CONTRACT,

26:18.500 --> 26:21.750
WHICH YOU'VE SIGNED,
WHICH STATES THAT YOUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY

26:21.750 --> 26:25.041
SHOULD BE TO THESE STUDENTS
AND THEIR WELFARE.

26:25.041 --> 26:28.792
IN FACT, IT DOESN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY
ANYWHERE IN THAT CONTRACT, SIR.

26:29.208 --> 26:31.000
CORRECT?

26:31.750 --> 26:33.834
THIS INTERVIEW IS AT AN END.

26:47.208 --> 26:48.667
NIKKI?

26:51.875 --> 26:53.166
CAN A CONCERNED FATHER
ASK WHERE HIS
DAUGHTER'S GOING

26:53.166 --> 26:55.250
IN SUCH A HURRY?

26:55.250 --> 26:57.708
HE CAN, BUT HE'S NOT
GOING TO LIKE THE ANSWER.

26:59.625 --> 27:00.542
JOEY'S RALLY.

27:00.542 --> 27:03.125
YOU COULD COME WITH ME,
YOU KNOW.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.625
YOU ALREADY KNOW
MY POSITION ON THAT.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.083
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
YOUR POSITION ON ANYTHING
ANYMORE.

27:06.083 --> 27:10.583
YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME
TRYING TO PROTECT
HOW YOU'RE SEEN

27:10.583 --> 27:12.208
FOR FEAR THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO PAINT YOU
AS SOME ANGRY MAN.

27:12.208 --> 27:14.417
I AM ANGRY.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.583
AND WHY
SHOULDN'T I BE?

27:19.917 --> 27:23.500
NIKKI, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
IT HURTS TO KNOW

27:23.500 --> 27:25.625
THAT I DID
THE RIGHT THING?

27:25.625 --> 27:28.166
AND I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

27:28.166 --> 27:29.250
AND BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S
DEEP-SEATED FEARS,

27:29.250 --> 27:30.792
IT'S NOT WORKING.

27:30.792 --> 27:33.917
NOW, I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE THESE KIDS,

27:33.917 --> 27:35.500
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE THIS TOWN,

27:35.500 --> 27:37.708
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT TO PUT YOU
THROUGH THIS.

27:38.291 --> 27:41.834
SO, YES, I AM ANGRY.

27:43.583 --> 27:46.625
BUT IF I SHOW MEN
LIKE ROBERT CAUFIELD
ONE FLASH OF THIS ANGER,

27:46.625 --> 27:49.166
THEY WILL USE IT
AGAINST ME.

27:49.166 --> 27:51.375
THE PEOPLE TONIGHT
AREN'T LIKE THAT.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.875
THEY'RE ON YOUR SIDE.

27:52.875 --> 27:54.000
THEY--THEY SUPPORT YOU.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.375
THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR YOU,
FOR US.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.166
AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT,
WIN OR LOSE, YOU SUPPORT THEM.

28:21.583 --> 28:23.542
NOW, I'D SAY THAT PACEY
DID A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE JOB

28:23.542 --> 28:25.041
OF GETTING THE WORD OUT
TO THE PEOPLE.

28:25.041 --> 28:25.708
DON'T YOU THINK?

28:25.708 --> 28:28.000
YEAH. SPEAKING OF PACEY,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.333
I HAVEN'T SEEN
OR HEARD FROM HIM ALL DAY.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.208
TESTING! TESTING.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.792
1,2, TESTING.
UNOS, DOS.  OK!

28:35.792 --> 28:38.708
AS YOU CAN SEE,
WE'RE NOT HAVING ANY
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES,

28:38.708 --> 28:41.375
SO I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER
TO THE LADY WHO'S
RESPONSIBLE

28:41.375 --> 28:42.708
FOR GATHERING US
ALL HERE TONIGHT.

28:42.708 --> 28:45.625
LET'S GIVE HER A NICE
WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE,
SHALL WE?

28:45.625 --> 28:47.667
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
MS. JOEY POTTER!

28:52.166 --> 28:53.959
THINK I WARMED
THEM UP FOR YOU?

28:56.667 --> 28:59.542
AHEM!

28:59.542 --> 29:02.875
WELL, UH, EVERYONE'S
BEEN COMING UP TO ME
IN THE LAST WEEK,

29:02.875 --> 29:06.708
ASKING ME WHY
I'M DOING THIS.

29:06.708 --> 29:07.875
EVEN PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY.

29:07.875 --> 29:10.792
I'VE CERTAINLY ASKED MYSELF
PLENTY OF TIMES.

29:10.792 --> 29:14.417
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE
MATT CAUFIELD TRASHED

29:14.417 --> 29:17.959
MY EXTRACURRICULAR
ART PROJECT AND I'VE SWORN
ETERNAL VENGEANCE.

29:17.959 --> 29:21.000
IT'S BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE
IN OUR TOWN SEEM TO THINK

29:21.000 --> 29:23.750
THAT OUR PRINCIPAL DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR US,

29:23.750 --> 29:25.458
THAT HE'S SOME SORT
OF AN OUTSIDER.

29:25.458 --> 29:28.125
BUT HOW CAN HE
BE AN OUTSIDER
WHEN HE'S BEEN THERE

29:28.125 --> 29:29.959
WALKING THE HALLS
OF OUR SCHOOL WITH US

29:29.959 --> 29:31.000
EVERY DAY SINCE SEPTEMBER?

29:31.000 --> 29:34.166
WHEN HE'S TAKEN THE TIME
TO GET TO KNOW US,

29:34.166 --> 29:36.291
TO FIGURE OUT OUR TALENTS,
WHETHER THEY BE FILMMAKING

29:36.291 --> 29:38.125
OR STUDENT GOVERNMENT
OR PAINTING

29:38.125 --> 29:41.250
AND SUPPORTED AND ENCOURAGED
ALL OF US WHO DON'T EVEN
KNOW YET

29:41.250 --> 29:42.250
WHAT OUR TALENTS ARE.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.750
HOW CAN HE BE
AN OUTSIDER

29:43.750 --> 29:46.625
WHEN HE'S BEEN THERE
WITH US EVERY DAY,

29:46.625 --> 29:48.125
TRYING TO MAKE OUR LIVES
BETTER?

29:50.041 --> 29:53.417
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
WE COULD DO TONIGHT--

29:53.417 --> 29:57.875
TALK ABOUT HOW
PRINCIPAL GREEN HAS MADE
OUR LIVES A LOT BETTER.

30:03.625 --> 30:06.792
OK, NO HANDS. UH...

30:06.792 --> 30:09.917
I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
I'M BACK IN MR. PETERSON'S
ENGLISH CLASS.

30:09.917 --> 30:10.917
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

30:12.458 --> 30:14.333
THAT'S BETTER.

30:15.834 --> 30:16.750
ANDIE.

30:16.750 --> 30:18.834
WELL, THE 2 MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS

30:18.834 --> 30:20.417
THAT I LEARNED
FROM PRINCIPAL GREEN

30:20.417 --> 30:25.875
WERE THAT MISTAKES AND SETBACKS
AREN'T NECESSARILY
IRREVERSIBLE.

30:25.875 --> 30:28.417
AND IF YOU CAN'T
LEARN FROM YOURSELF,

30:28.417 --> 30:29.917
THEN YOU CAN'T LEARN
FROM ANYBODY.

30:29.917 --> 30:32.291
HE DOESN'T TREAT US
LIKE CHILDREN, EVEN
WHEN WE ACT LIKE THEM.

30:32.291 --> 30:33.708
HE TREATS US
WITH RESPECT

30:33.708 --> 30:35.375
AND LISTENS TO WHAT
WE HAVE TO SAY.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.375
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FORM THIS
COMMITTEE...

30:37.375 --> 30:40.041
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
VERY MANY OF YOU.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.375
I'M THE NEW KID AND ALL.

30:41.375 --> 30:45.083
BUT WHAT I DO I KNOW
ABOUT YOU IS WHAT
MY FATHER TELLS ME

30:45.083 --> 30:49.834
AT HOME OVER DINNER,
WHILE WE'RE WATCHING TV,

30:49.834 --> 30:51.875
WHEN WE'RE DOING THE DISHES,

30:51.875 --> 30:54.750
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT HE TALKS ABOUT.

30:54.750 --> 30:57.333
THAT'S ALL HE TALKS ABOUT,

30:57.333 --> 31:00.500
HIS STUDENTS,
HIS SCHOOL.

31:25.875 --> 31:30.166
I HAD MIXED FEELINGS
ABOUT COMING HERE
THIS EVENING.

31:30.166 --> 31:32.750
BUT AFTER SITTING AT HOME
AND THINKING ABOUT
SOME OF THE THINGS

31:32.750 --> 31:35.291
MY DAUGHTER SAID EARLIER,

31:35.291 --> 31:37.792
IT WAS CLEAR THAT
I NEEDED TO COME.

31:37.792 --> 31:41.708
SHE SAID, "DAD, THOSE PEOPLE
ARE ON YOUR SIDE.

31:41.708 --> 31:44.708
THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR YOU."

31:44.708 --> 31:46.875
AND SO I WANTED TO COME

31:46.875 --> 31:51.542
AND TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.000
NOW, NEITHER MYSELF
NOR DR. FIELDING

31:54.000 --> 31:56.750
SEEM TO BE WILLING TO BUDGE
ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE,

31:56.750 --> 31:59.792
AND SO IT LOOKS LIKE
I'LL BE LEAVING.

32:00.625 --> 32:02.166
AS I LOOK AROUND
THIS EVENING,

32:04.667 --> 32:06.083
I'M MOTIVATED,

32:06.083 --> 32:08.375
BECAUSE I SEE
A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE

32:08.375 --> 32:12.250
WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO HARNESS
THEIR INNER POWER

32:12.250 --> 32:13.333
AS INDIVIDUALS.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.708
REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME
OF THIS SITUATION,

32:17.708 --> 32:20.125
KNOW THAT I THANK YOU.

32:22.959 --> 32:24.583
ALL OF YOU.

32:24.583 --> 32:26.041
THANK YOU.

32:56.291 --> 32:58.083
SO YOU DID IT.

32:58.083 --> 33:00.208
YOU RALLIED TO A CERTAIN
SOMEONE'S SIDE

33:00.208 --> 33:02.000
IN A VERY DUCKIE-LIKE
MANNER.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.458
YEAH. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.500
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

33:06.500 --> 33:07.625
TO BE HONEST?

33:07.625 --> 33:08.875
I FEEL LIKE DOG MEAT.

33:08.875 --> 33:11.583
SHE DIDN'T EVEN
THANK ME.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.417
SHE WILL...

33:14.417 --> 33:16.291
ONE DAY.

33:16.291 --> 33:17.500
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SURE?

33:17.500 --> 33:19.750
BECAUSE EVERY DUCK
HAS HIS DAY.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.041
JUST ASK HENRY.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.625
YOU READY TO GO?

33:38.625 --> 33:41.500
WHENEVER YOU ARE.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.125
THINK SHE'LL LET US
IN THE HOUSE?

33:43.125 --> 33:47.959
BESSIE? IF SHE DOESN'T,
WE'LL SLEEP IN THE CAR.

33:47.959 --> 33:48.959
WANNA DRIVE?

33:48.959 --> 33:51.750
STICK SHIFT?
NO, THANKS.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.333
I THINK I'VE
HAD ENOUGH--

33:54.792 --> 33:57.083
CHALLENGES THIS WEEK.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.875
Bessie: BACKING DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE?

33:58.875 --> 34:00.000
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
THE JOEY POTTER I KNOW.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.041
IT CERTAINLY
WASN'T THE ONE

34:01.041 --> 34:04.500
IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE
PEOPLE TONIGHT.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.708
YOU SAW?

34:05.708 --> 34:06.375
YEAH.

34:06.375 --> 34:08.041
WELL, ALEXANDER HERE,

34:08.041 --> 34:09.958
HE JUST INSISTED
ON COMING.

34:09.958 --> 34:12.250
SEE, HE'S EXTREMELY PROUD
OF HIS AUNT JOEY.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.375
REALLY.

34:14.375 --> 34:17.166
OH, YEAH. WHEN
YOU'RE NOT AROUND,

34:17.166 --> 34:18.708
HE GOES ON AND ON ABOUT
HOW TALENTED YOU ARE

34:18.708 --> 34:21.750
AND HOW SMART...

34:21.750 --> 34:22.333
AND HOW BRAVE.

34:27.041 --> 34:28.542
YOU KNOW,
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

34:28.542 --> 34:30.208
MAYBE I WILL
DRIVE US HOME.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.625
[KNOCKING]

34:48.625 --> 34:50.208
COME IN.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.250
AH, MS. POTTER.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.083
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
IN MY OFFICE
IN A LONG TIME.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.417
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOURSELF
IN TROUBLE, I HOPE.

35:07.083 --> 35:08.750
YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES.

35:08.750 --> 35:09.792
YOU COULD STILL
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

35:09.792 --> 35:11.375
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

35:12.583 --> 35:14.500
NO, I...

35:15.625 --> 35:18.041
MAYBE.

35:18.750 --> 35:19.750
I DON'T KNOW.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.917
WHY IS THAT?

35:22.917 --> 35:26.291
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.333
IT'S JUST, UH...

35:30.333 --> 35:33.208
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEELING
THAT MAYBE I, UH...

35:34.875 --> 35:37.750
I FAILED YOU.

35:40.625 --> 35:43.667
WE COULDN'T STOP THEM.

35:44.959 --> 35:47.375
WE WEREN'T LOUD ENOUGH
OR...

35:50.417 --> 35:53.041
OR STRONG ENOUGH.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.250
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

35:59.792 --> 36:02.083
JOEY.

36:03.208 --> 36:04.750
LOOK AT ME.

36:04.750 --> 36:06.708
LOOK AT ME.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.625
IN ALL MY YEARS
IN EDUCATION,

36:11.625 --> 36:14.583
I HAVE NEVER FELT
MORE SUCCESSFUL

36:14.583 --> 36:17.417
THAN I FEEL RIGHT NOW.

36:17.417 --> 36:20.041
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

36:23.750 --> 36:26.708
THANK YOU
FOR FIGHTING FOR ME.

36:33.583 --> 36:35.041
YOU'RE WELCOME.

36:36.041 --> 36:37.750
I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO GO HOME.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
AFTER YOU.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.917
I'LL SEE YOU,
MR. GREEN.

36:52.917 --> 36:54.917
SEE YOU, JOEY.

37:00.708 --> 37:02.458
[SUSTAINED APPLAUSE]

37:23.834 --> 37:24.500
[CHEERING]

37:54.875 --> 37:56.542
TELL EVERYONE THAT
I CAN BE DOWN THERE

37:56.542 --> 37:58.417
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

37:58.417 --> 37:59.750
OK.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.375
OK, I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.500
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
DISTINCTLY GOOD NEWS.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.875
THEY'RE GONNA RUN IT--
OUR STORY, TONIGHT.

38:08.875 --> 38:10.125
THEY WANT ME
TO RACE DOWN NOW

38:10.125 --> 38:11.458
AND TAPE AN INTRO
AT THE STATION.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.625
MOM, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

38:12.625 --> 38:13.708
OH, AND THAT'S
NOT ALL.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.291
ONE OF THE EXECUTIVE
PRODUCERS ASKED ME

38:16.291 --> 38:17.291
IF I WOULD BE
INTERESTED IN DOING

38:17.291 --> 38:19.291
A FEW OTHER
SPECIAL REPORTS

38:19.291 --> 38:20.959
IN THE UPCOMING
MONTHS.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.458
THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT'D YOU TELL THEM?

38:22.458 --> 38:26.500
I TOLD THEM
I'D GET BACK TO THEM...

38:26.500 --> 38:27.917
IN ABOUT 20 YEARS

38:27.917 --> 38:30.625
IF AND WHEN I RETIRE
FROM THE RESTAURANT
BUSINESS.

38:30.625 --> 38:31.500
YOU'RE KIDDING?

38:31.500 --> 38:33.792
I THOUGHT THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANTED.

38:33.792 --> 38:36.667
NO. I THINK
WHAT I WANTED

38:36.667 --> 38:39.208
WAS JUST MY CHANCE
TO SAY NO,

38:39.208 --> 38:42.125
TO LEAVE
ON MY OWN TERMS,

38:42.125 --> 38:46.625
TO START FRESH
WITH NO REGRETS.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.041
AND I CAN DO THAT NOW
BECAUSE OF YOU.

38:49.041 --> 38:51.667
WHAT DID I DO?

38:51.667 --> 38:53.792
WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO.
YOU INSPIRED ME, HONEY,

38:53.792 --> 38:55.917
THE WAY THAT YOU
INSPIRE EVERYBODY.

38:55.917 --> 38:58.333
YOU SEE, AS MUCH AS
YOU THINK YOU'VE
CHANGED, DAWSON,

38:58.333 --> 38:59.250
YOU'RE STILL
THE QUIET HERO--

38:59.250 --> 39:01.500
STEPPING IN
AT THE RIGHT TIME,

39:01.500 --> 39:03.000
LENDING YOUR EFFORTS,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.458
NEVER ASKING
FOR A REWARD IN RETURN.

39:07.333 --> 39:11.458
YOU'RE SMART, CAPABLE,
SINCERE.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.500
SEE, I THINK
YOU'RE EDITORIALIZING.

39:26.000 --> 39:26.750
Pacey: OH, COME ON.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.458
JUST A LITTLE BIT
FARTHER.

39:28.458 --> 39:29.792
[HUMMING]

39:29.792 --> 39:30.834
A COUPLE MORE STEPS.

39:30.834 --> 39:32.625
RIGHT HERE. WHOA.
STOP. RIGHT THERE.

39:32.625 --> 39:33.917
PERFECT. WE'RE HERE.

39:33.917 --> 39:35.917
PACEY, I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU THINK "HERE" IS,

39:35.917 --> 39:37.250
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
WE'RE NOWHERE.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.417
THINK BACK WITH ME
FOR JUST A SECOND.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.583
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW
THIS WHOLE THING
STARTED?

39:40.583 --> 39:42.667
IT STARTED WITH
A GIRL, A WALL...

39:42.667 --> 39:43.375
AND A PAINTBRUSH.

39:43.375 --> 39:45.166
YOU BOUGHT ME A PAINTBRUSH?

39:45.166 --> 39:46.667
NO, LAME-O.

39:46.667 --> 39:48.542
I STOLE THIS FROM YOUR
PERMANENT COLLECTION.

39:50.583 --> 39:51.708
YOU BOUGHT ME A WALL?

39:51.708 --> 39:53.000
NOT BOUGHT. RENTED.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.708
AND THIS THING DIDN'T
COME CHEAP, EITHER.

39:54.708 --> 39:55.333
IT COST ME 100 BUCKS.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.667
YOU BOUGHT ME A WALL?

39:57.667 --> 39:59.542
YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.

39:59.542 --> 40:01.041
LOOK, IT'S A LIMITED
TIME OFFER,

40:01.041 --> 40:02.083
SO YOU SHOULD
GET CRACKING.

40:02.083 --> 40:04.125
PACEY, DID YOU
FAIL TO NOTICE

40:04.125 --> 40:05.917
THE SIZE OF THIS THING?

40:05.917 --> 40:07.417
I JUST THOUGHT
YOUR NEXT ENDEAVOR

40:07.417 --> 40:08.542
SHOULD BE
BIGGER AND BETTER
THAN YOUR LAST ONE.

40:08.542 --> 40:11.208
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU KEEP ON GROWING

40:11.208 --> 40:12.542
BOTH AS A PERSON
AND AS AN ARTIST.

40:12.542 --> 40:13.583
I ALSO GOT YOU THIS.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.375
I KNOW IT'S NOT GONNA
COVER THE WHOLE THING,

40:15.375 --> 40:17.375
BUT, AS THE SAYING GOES,
THE JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES

40:17.375 --> 40:19.208
BEGINS WITH
A SINGLE STEP.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.083
I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP ON THIS ONE.

40:21.083 --> 40:23.458
NO, NO, NO.
NOT THIS TIME.

40:23.458 --> 40:26.500
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN,
SISTER.

40:26.500 --> 40:28.500
PACEY, YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.708
AS SOON AS I THINK
I HAVE YOU ALL FIGURED OUT,

40:29.708 --> 40:34.417
YOU GO AND YOU DO
SOMETHING SO OUTRAGEOUS

40:34.417 --> 40:35.750
THAT COMPLETELY
CHALLENGES ME

40:35.750 --> 40:38.625
IN A WAY THAT NO ONE ELSE
WOULD EVEN THINK OF,

40:38.625 --> 40:40.125
THAT...

40:42.000 --> 40:42.750
IN CASE I DON'T
SAY IT ENOUGH...

40:45.250 --> 40:46.625
THANK YOU.

40:50.250 --> 40:50.708
IT'S ABOUT TIME, POTTER.

IT'S ABOUT TIME.
