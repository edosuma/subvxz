WEBVTT

00:50.809 --> 00:52.362
You were incredible.

00:53.018 --> 00:55.227
My heart is still racing.

00:56.677 --> 00:58.437
I felt it too.

00:58.541 --> 01:00.474
All thanks
to your brute strength, Dash,

01:00.577 --> 01:03.718
and your knowledge
of ancient Aramaic mathematics.

01:03.822 --> 01:06.721
Please. This has nothing to do
with my two doctorates

01:06.825 --> 01:08.896
and my master's
in Gender Studies

01:09.793 --> 01:12.762
and everything to do
with you, Dr. Lovemore.

01:13.211 --> 01:15.109
The truth is,

01:15.213 --> 01:17.594
I never thought I would find
the Lost City of D.

01:17.698 --> 01:20.632
I would
choose your words carefully.

01:20.735 --> 01:22.496
They will be your last.

01:22.599 --> 01:26.362
You led me right
to King Kalaman's tomb

01:26.465 --> 01:30.055
and his queen's
legendary Crown of Fire.

01:30.159 --> 01:33.058
And now I will be very rich,

01:33.162 --> 01:35.854
and you will be very dead.

01:36.786 --> 01:40.169
Hold up. Are these--
Are these your snakes?

01:40.272 --> 01:41.894
No, they were just here.

01:41.998 --> 01:44.449
There were just
hundreds of snakes
in this temple

01:44.552 --> 01:46.416
just waiting for us
to show up?

01:46.520 --> 01:48.625
Who feeds them? You feed them?No, what do they eat?

01:48.729 --> 01:50.938
Why is that one
not biting that guy?
Why is that happening?

01:51.041 --> 01:53.906
-Are they trained not
to bite henchmen or something?
-Yeah, well...

01:54.010 --> 01:56.288
I mean, the snake-to-temple
ratio alone...

01:56.392 --> 01:58.842
This is ridiculous.
Delete.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.018
I-- I think my character
can still work.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.847
Delete.

02:03.951 --> 02:06.126
Loretta, you still have
a story to write.

02:06.816 --> 02:08.128
Delete.

02:10.509 --> 02:12.373
Hey, it's me, Beth.

02:12.477 --> 02:14.893
I don't want to pull the whole
"I'm your publisher" card,
but I am.

02:14.996 --> 02:17.344
And I'm really looking forward
to seeing this last chapter.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.484
But no pressure.
No, there actually is pressure.

02:19.587 --> 02:23.764
The exact amount of pressure
that motivates you
but doesn't paralyze you.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.248
You got this.

02:26.801 --> 02:27.768
Thank you.

02:27.871 --> 02:29.908
Me again.

02:30.011 --> 02:31.875
Okay, so everything
is set for the book tour,

02:31.979 --> 02:34.809
but, uh, the only thing we need
is a book to tour with.

02:34.913 --> 02:37.053
I can't help
but get the feeling that
you're not finishing

02:37.157 --> 02:39.607
because you don't want
to leave your house.

02:39.711 --> 02:44.888
Listen, I know these last
five years have been hard
after John's passing,

02:44.992 --> 02:48.375
and it feels easier
to live in your bathtub,

02:48.478 --> 02:51.136
drinking Chardonnay on ice.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.035
But, girl,
there is a great big world
waiting for you

02:54.139 --> 02:57.142
and a book tour
that I can't cancel, so just
make it happen, all right?

02:57.246 --> 02:58.488
Love you, bye!

03:17.507 --> 03:19.026
We have to keep going.

03:20.061 --> 03:22.547
Let's see
what's on the other side
of that door.

03:22.650 --> 03:24.756
But what if
there isn't anything?

03:25.515 --> 03:27.586
There's only one way
to find out.

03:28.484 --> 03:30.417
Then Lovemore realized

03:30.520 --> 03:32.798
the treasure she wanted
was lost forever

03:32.902 --> 03:35.284
and her adventures
were coming to an end.

03:35.387 --> 03:36.526
That doesn't feel right.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.425
Yeah, but that's it.

03:38.528 --> 03:39.978
That's the end.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.575
Well, John,

03:51.161 --> 03:52.266
here I go.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.648
Dulcius ex asperis.

04:01.171 --> 04:03.933
Okay, honey, it's showtime.
-Are you sure about this?

04:04.036 --> 04:07.626
Because I have a wedgie
in the back and in the front
in this thing.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.973
I feel like
a nerdy figure skater.

04:10.077 --> 04:12.769
Sexy. Stunner.
I'm all about it.No, it's not. It's not.

04:12.873 --> 04:14.806
-How do I move in this?
-Don't touch it.

04:14.909 --> 04:17.118
I'm not touching it.
I'm holding it out.Stop it. Will you stop?

04:17.222 --> 04:19.397
Get it out now
'cause you can't do that
onstage.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.192
And we're done.
And we're done. Okay, good.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.194
Do I need to be wearing
a glitter onesie?

04:24.298 --> 04:25.748
You only have to wear this
for two hours.

04:25.851 --> 04:27.819
Do not mess this up,
do you hear me?
This is on loan.

04:27.922 --> 04:29.924
Everyone's wearing
sequins right now.

04:31.443 --> 04:33.514
Why is she taking my photo?This is Allison.

04:33.618 --> 04:35.930
She is our new
social media manager.

04:36.034 --> 04:38.864
And she's gonna be helping us
target that younger demographic.

04:38.968 --> 04:41.453
Meaning women in their 30s
who wish they were in their 20s.

04:41.557 --> 04:43.075
Hey, what's up?

04:43.179 --> 04:46.527
Um, I took over your socials,
so this morning you tweeted,

04:46.631 --> 04:51.808
"Where are my ladies at?
Meet me at Ballroom G
at- 00 p.m.

04:51.912 --> 04:53.362
#ShawnMendes.

04:53.465 --> 04:56.330
#GaggingToMeetYouAll."

04:56.434 --> 04:58.988
Okay, we are having fun.
Let's go.

04:59.091 --> 05:02.060
We need to remind people
that you are still alive.

05:02.163 --> 05:03.579
People know I'm alive.

05:03.682 --> 05:05.650
And to remind them
why this used to be

05:05.753 --> 05:07.824
the best selling franchise.In Romance.

05:07.928 --> 05:10.551
Yes, which is the top
revenue-generating
literary category.

05:10.655 --> 05:13.520
Revenue-generating
isn't how I would describe
our presales right now.

05:13.623 --> 05:15.763
Just think of this as a way
that uses word of mouth.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.489
Oh, you want word of mouth?
Here we go. How's this?

05:17.593 --> 05:20.389
"The only thing
more lost than the city
is the author herself."

05:20.492 --> 05:22.252
"Loveless."
"Passionless."

05:22.356 --> 05:26.256
Uh, "Way past her prime."
And, oh, "This is fake history
at its worst."

05:26.360 --> 05:28.535
A book tour could
change everything, okay?

05:28.638 --> 05:30.951
We have to remind the fans
why they love you so much.

05:31.054 --> 05:34.644
Real history.
I merely season it
with a smidge more nudity.

05:34.748 --> 05:36.957
History had
a ton of nudity.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.891
Deep exploration.

05:39.994 --> 05:42.480
Steamy wondering.

05:42.583 --> 05:47.623
Will Lovemore and Dash find
Queen Taha's priceless
Crown of Fire?

05:47.726 --> 05:49.521
Join them on their search.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.558
So, listen, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

05:51.661 --> 05:52.904
There's so many people.

05:53.007 --> 05:55.147
I know how much you hate
doing these things,

05:55.251 --> 05:57.978
so I've invited Alan
to do the Q and A
with you today.

05:58.081 --> 06:00.083
-What?
-And the rest of the book tour.

06:00.187 --> 06:03.155
Beth, I expressly asked
not to do any more events
with Dash-- Alan, Alan!

06:03.259 --> 06:06.089
-He's gonna humiliate me.
-He's not gonna humiliate you.

06:06.193 --> 06:09.230
Thank you.
You're very good at your job.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

06:09.334 --> 06:10.542
Let me help you with that.

06:10.646 --> 06:12.544
He is-- He's
a body wash commercial.

06:12.648 --> 06:14.512
He's always glistening
all over the place.

06:14.615 --> 06:17.515
There hasn't been an event
where his shirt
didn't come flying off.

06:17.618 --> 06:19.137
You wish.
Well, he's already here,

06:19.240 --> 06:21.381
so put on your big-girl panties
and let's get out there.

06:21.484 --> 06:24.660
Remember,
no grumpy face, big words
or boring academic talk.

06:24.763 --> 06:28.042
Yes! Yes!

06:28.146 --> 06:30.079
Come on, RTP!

06:30.182 --> 06:31.667
Ha-ha!

06:31.770 --> 06:34.014
Yes, my Lovemore-heads!

06:34.117 --> 06:37.569
I am so excited
to introduce to you

06:37.673 --> 06:41.504
the award-winning author,
Loretta Sage!

06:41.608 --> 06:44.162
Beth, I can't do this.
I'm not ready.Are you kidding me?

06:44.265 --> 06:45.991
Listen, I've got your back.
You got this.

06:46.095 --> 06:47.614
Go give the people
what they want.

06:47.717 --> 06:49.581
It's not me they want.Get out there now!

06:52.135 --> 06:55.967
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you. Thank you.

07:01.317 --> 07:03.043
Yep. Mount it.

07:05.494 --> 07:08.393
Mount it. Mount it.
Okay.

07:08.497 --> 07:10.188
Find your center.

07:10.291 --> 07:13.847
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

07:13.950 --> 07:15.711
The sexiest...
All right!

07:15.814 --> 07:19.818
...most influential hero
of a generation.

07:19.922 --> 07:21.130
That's a bit strong.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.857
His 20th cover
of an Angela Lovemore novel.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.584
Dash McMahon!

07:32.037 --> 07:34.557
Oh, my God! Dash!

07:57.235 --> 07:59.582
Take a bow.I already did mine.
I did mine.

07:59.686 --> 08:02.654
Okay, come on.
One more. I got you.

08:17.669 --> 08:19.326
Did you guys rehearse that?
Oh, my God.

08:19.429 --> 08:23.261
I'm loving this chemistry
between you two,
and I got to say,

08:23.364 --> 08:25.505
I love this book.

08:25.608 --> 08:26.678
Oh, thank you, Ray.Thank--

08:26.782 --> 08:28.128
Spoiler alert.

08:28.231 --> 08:29.509
A really bold choice

08:29.612 --> 08:31.545
to not have them go
into the tomb at the end.

08:31.649 --> 08:33.271
Talk about
what went into this one.

08:33.374 --> 08:36.826
I mean, this one's
such a special book
for me personally.

08:36.930 --> 08:39.760
I-- I don't know how to say
how much it means to me

08:39.864 --> 08:41.969
that Loretta,
word writer extraordinaire,

08:42.073 --> 08:45.110
has, you know,
named the book after me.

08:45.214 --> 08:47.043
The Lost City of Dash.

08:47.147 --> 08:48.251
The Lost City of D.

08:48.355 --> 08:50.599
Um, but that's not what
the D stands for.

08:50.702 --> 08:53.291
It's D for "dick," right?No dick, no.

08:53.394 --> 08:56.501
It's based on the name
of an ancient tribe,
Dapocagihou-dysphem-ica.

08:56.605 --> 09:01.161
And, um, it was too difficult
for the European colonizers
to pronounce,

09:01.264 --> 09:04.544
so, in true colonial fashion
they abbreviated it.No one cares about this.

09:04.647 --> 09:06.373
That's so interesting.
Okay.

09:06.476 --> 09:08.789
How about we
take some questions
from the audience?

09:08.893 --> 09:10.688
Right here, handsome!Yes.

09:10.791 --> 09:14.933
Dash, what's your favorite
romantic moment?Ooh.

09:15.037 --> 09:19.559
What I would really like
to know is what is Loretta's
favorite romantic moment?

09:19.662 --> 09:21.595
Ooh, spicy.

09:21.699 --> 09:23.632
Oh, uh...

09:23.735 --> 09:26.427
-Well, being a sapiosexual--

09:26.531 --> 09:28.740
Oh, is that when
they do the snakes
around the...

09:28.844 --> 09:32.917
No. That's someone
who finds, uh, intellect

09:33.020 --> 09:36.921
or intelligence,
uh, very sexy, you know.

09:37.024 --> 09:38.129
Same.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.855
Really?

09:39.958 --> 09:42.374
Dash! Rip off your shirt!

09:42.478 --> 09:46.206
No, no, no.
We're not gonna do that today.
We're here for Loretta's book.

09:46.309 --> 09:48.173
Do we have questions
for Loretta?

09:48.277 --> 09:53.454
Uh, yes,
studious-looking young lady?
What would you like to ask me?

09:53.558 --> 09:55.595
Can you rip off Dash's shirt?

09:57.148 --> 09:59.978
No, no. We're not gonna
do this again. Sorry.

10:00.082 --> 10:02.602
Rip it off! Rip it off!

10:02.705 --> 10:05.018
Rip it off! Rip it off!
Rip it off!

10:05.121 --> 10:08.849
Of course. Of course, yes.
Can do.

10:09.816 --> 10:11.093
Is this happening?

10:11.196 --> 10:12.922
You don't have to do this.Oh, we have to.

10:13.026 --> 10:15.097
We have to give the people
what they want. Yes, yes.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.927
We have to give the people
what they want, yes.

10:18.031 --> 10:21.275
Ladies and gentlemen,
enjoy.

10:21.379 --> 10:26.039
Because The Lost City of D
is Dash's final adventure.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.213
If there even
is a next book,

10:28.317 --> 10:31.423
it will open with Lovemore
receiving the tragic news

10:31.527 --> 10:33.874
of his untimely death.

10:33.978 --> 10:35.358
What?

10:35.462 --> 10:36.912
Shit. I'm sorry.
My smartwatch is stuck.Ow. Hold on.

10:37.015 --> 10:38.085
I know. Don't pull it.

10:38.189 --> 10:39.708
It's okay. Just be real still.

10:39.811 --> 10:41.226
No. That's pulling it.You're pulling it.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.919
You're gonna rip my wig off.
No, you can't--

10:48.337 --> 10:49.303
Oh, my!

10:49.407 --> 10:50.822
Oh, my God.Is he okay?

10:50.926 --> 10:52.548
God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.309
-I'm so sorry.
You're a bad person.

10:55.413 --> 10:59.659
Stick around
for the costume contest
at- 00 p.m.

11:00.521 --> 11:02.765
"If there is another book"?

11:02.869 --> 11:07.770
I'm investing
everything we've got
into this tour, okay?

11:07.874 --> 11:11.325
I just don't think I have
another Dash and Lovemore
adventure in me.

11:11.429 --> 11:12.810
How does Dash die?

11:12.913 --> 11:15.053
Was it the snakes?No.

11:15.157 --> 11:17.504
Okay, so I have something
that I have to take care of.

11:17.607 --> 11:20.058
You guys have an interview
in the next suite
in ten minutes.

11:20.162 --> 11:22.578
So can you please do me a favor
and be grown-ups

11:22.682 --> 11:24.200
and get yourselves there
on your own?

11:24.304 --> 11:25.512
Okay. Thank you so much.

11:26.306 --> 11:28.377
Does he die from
a staph infection?

11:30.344 --> 11:32.415
It is a staph infection.
I knew it.

11:33.589 --> 11:34.970
I-I-- All right.

11:35.073 --> 11:38.145
Look, I get it
if you need a break
or something,

11:38.249 --> 11:40.251
but you can't
just kill me, okay?Okay.

11:40.354 --> 11:44.738
I hate that I have to
ask this, but you do know
you're not Dash, right?

11:44.842 --> 11:47.016
Dash is a character
I made up.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.362
Dash?

11:51.193 --> 11:52.435
Thanks.

11:52.539 --> 11:53.747
Thank you.

11:56.232 --> 11:58.510
Loretta, it's this way.No, I think it's this way.

11:58.614 --> 12:00.961
Can't you see that Dash
means so much to people?

12:01.065 --> 12:02.929
Means so much to you.Not to me.

12:03.032 --> 12:04.689
Well, yeah, to me,
but to other people too.

12:04.793 --> 12:07.761
What about Beth?You know what?
Beth is gonna be fine.

12:07.865 --> 12:11.696
She's gonna find plenty
fresh, young writers
full of great ideas.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.802
You can transition gracefully

12:13.905 --> 12:16.252
into the shirt-on phase
of your modeling career,

12:16.356 --> 12:17.702
and I can be left alone.

12:17.806 --> 12:19.531
Everybody is happy.

12:19.635 --> 12:21.430
No, it's this way.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.363
Beth says you don't even
leave the house anymore.

12:23.466 --> 12:25.503
I don't feel like
that's very happy.

12:25.606 --> 12:28.506
You should be going out in
the world, filling yourself up
on new experiences.

12:28.609 --> 12:30.853
I'm already filled up.
I'm full. I'm fully satiated.

12:30.957 --> 12:34.305
Why would you want
to be stuck at home alone
when you could see the world?

12:34.408 --> 12:35.927
You could be visiting
ancient Greece.

12:36.031 --> 12:38.930
Okay. How could I visit
ancient Greece?

12:39.034 --> 12:41.070
I get it. Because
you're afraid of flying.

12:41.174 --> 12:44.591
No. Because ancient Greece
is in the past.

12:44.694 --> 12:46.248
Just like Dash.

12:46.351 --> 12:49.561
Okay. You want to know who else
is stuck in the past? You are.

12:49.665 --> 12:52.426
You're so afraid
of life hurting you again
that you've stopped living.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.843
You're like a human mummy.

12:56.327 --> 12:58.363
I didn't, um...

12:59.640 --> 13:00.814
Oh.

13:00.918 --> 13:03.058
Mummies are human.

13:12.343 --> 13:14.310
Stupid-- Oh, crap.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.348
I'm so sorry.
I-I will clean this up.

13:17.451 --> 13:19.937
I am not a litterer,
I-I assure you that.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.526
Do you, um--
Do you think you could, uh,
call a car for me, please?

13:23.630 --> 13:25.149
Thank you. Thank you.

13:27.910 --> 13:29.084
Bring the car around.

13:29.187 --> 13:30.637
God, is that
someone's retainer?

13:30.740 --> 13:33.088
I've never said the right thing
one time around her.

13:33.191 --> 13:35.124
I get nervous
because she opens her mouth,

13:35.228 --> 13:39.680
and just an encyclopedia
of beautifulness comes out,
and I just never say--

13:39.784 --> 13:41.096
You know
she's trying to kill me?

13:41.199 --> 13:43.374
I just need
those tomatoes.

13:43.477 --> 13:45.825
You're right.
No, you're right.

13:45.928 --> 13:47.412
I should apologize.
Thank you, man.

13:47.516 --> 13:49.759
I appreciate that
very, very much.You're welcome.

13:59.908 --> 14:02.186
Uh, Loretta Sage. Yeah.

14:07.398 --> 14:08.502
Uh--

14:09.814 --> 14:11.022
Hiya.

14:11.126 --> 14:12.610
Uh, I did not order
an UberPool.

14:12.713 --> 14:15.682
Someone wants to meet you.
We'll have you right back.

14:15.785 --> 14:16.959
Um...

14:20.445 --> 14:21.722
Loretta!

14:21.826 --> 14:23.345
Loretta! Loretta?

14:26.244 --> 14:28.108
Uh, Loretta?

14:28.212 --> 14:30.800
Did you say "Loretta"?Yeah.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.112
Follow that SUV, man.No.

14:32.216 --> 14:33.976
Come on, please!No, no, no.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.152
I'm not helping
any more handsome strangers.
Fool me once. Mm-mmm.

14:37.255 --> 14:40.569
What is this, Taken?
Am I "tooken"?

14:40.672 --> 14:42.088
Am I sold already?

14:42.191 --> 14:45.194
Am I--
Am I sold to him?

14:45.298 --> 14:48.957
Ow. Stop.Oh, no. Did this feel creepy?

14:49.060 --> 14:51.683
I said
don't make it creepy, guys.

14:51.787 --> 14:53.616
I'm so sorry
about the setting.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.309
I just flew in.
I was in a real panic
to meet you.

14:56.412 --> 14:58.483
I didn't have time
to dress the place up much.

14:58.587 --> 15:01.383
I read you love cheese,
so I just got them all.

15:01.486 --> 15:05.559
Are you the one
who's been emailing me
for photos of my feet?

15:05.663 --> 15:07.527
No. Um--

15:07.630 --> 15:11.945
And I promise
what I'm about to show you
is gonna make you very happy.

15:12.704 --> 15:13.913
But first, a little bit

15:14.016 --> 15:17.226
about the mysterious rogue
you see before you.

15:17.330 --> 15:19.608
Uh, my name
is Abigail Fairfax.

15:19.711 --> 15:22.645
Abigail?It's a gender-neutral name,
like Leslie or Beverly.

15:22.749 --> 15:26.442
Yes, but you're Abigail Fairfax
of the media-mogul Fairfaxes?

15:27.374 --> 15:30.584
Didn't you just
take over your company or...

15:30.688 --> 15:34.623
No, that was my brother,
actually. That was Leslie.
We're all very proud.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.833
Ah. Yes, I should say so,
at such a young age to--

15:37.937 --> 15:39.869
Some might even say
too young.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.700
But that world
never really interested me.

15:42.803 --> 15:45.392
My passions, as you may know,

15:45.496 --> 15:48.602
lie in the hidden things
in the world,

15:48.706 --> 15:51.329
things which defy possession.

15:51.433 --> 15:54.470
Um, some might call me
a collector.

15:54.574 --> 15:58.267
But there is one obsession
in particular

15:58.371 --> 16:00.476
that has held me captive.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.134
The Crown of Fire

16:03.238 --> 16:05.619
and its cascading
red diamonds.

16:05.723 --> 16:09.382
Is this a... Is this
a hidden-camera thing?

16:09.485 --> 16:13.075
So imagine my surprise
when, in your new book,

16:13.179 --> 16:16.458
amidst the pages
of coital reverie,

16:16.561 --> 16:17.390
was something...

16:17.493 --> 16:19.564
Oh, God....quite magnificent.

16:21.428 --> 16:23.983
I get it. I get it.
I so get it right now.

16:24.086 --> 16:25.398
Oh, my gosh.

16:25.501 --> 16:27.676
I literally thought
you guys kidnapped me.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.265
I mean,
this is marketing, right?
Beth set this up?

16:30.368 --> 16:33.268
This was so good, you guys.
This was amazing.

16:33.371 --> 16:36.616
You, with your gun
and your mustache

16:36.719 --> 16:39.688
and your,
"You'd better get in there"
and you know...

16:40.896 --> 16:42.415
Oh, my God.

16:42.518 --> 16:46.281
You, with the G.I. Joe
tone-on-tone outfit.

16:46.384 --> 16:51.389
Your fictional archaeologist
was making real translations
of a dead language.

16:51.493 --> 16:54.392
Mm-hmm.Something nobody else
has been able to do.

16:54.496 --> 16:56.912
Well, nobody else
had ever tried.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.845
Is that right?
Am I saying the right thing?

16:58.948 --> 17:00.605
Except you, right?

17:00.709 --> 17:02.676
Except me!

17:02.780 --> 17:04.506
Yes. See, it turns out

17:04.609 --> 17:07.923
Loretta Sage
was once a young college girl
doing her dissertation

17:08.027 --> 17:10.891
on the dead language of the D
with her future husband,

17:10.995 --> 17:14.102
dreaming
of finding Kalaman's tomb
and the Crown of Fire.

17:14.205 --> 17:17.312
I was sorry to read
you gave up your search
after he died.

17:17.415 --> 17:19.038
But what that means is,

17:20.315 --> 17:22.213
you're all I have left.

17:22.317 --> 17:25.492
All-All you have left
for... what?

17:25.596 --> 17:26.631
Hmm.

17:28.426 --> 17:29.669
Oh.

17:29.772 --> 17:31.153
Here we go.

17:45.271 --> 17:46.996
What is this?

17:47.100 --> 17:50.793
I believe it is describing
the exact location
of Kalaman's tomb,

17:50.897 --> 17:54.349
in which Taha
and her priceless headdress
are buried.

17:54.452 --> 17:56.592
Well, if this were authentic,

17:56.696 --> 18:02.046
you would still have to
uncover an entire city

18:02.150 --> 18:05.187
that nobody
has been able to find.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.947
I found it.

18:07.051 --> 18:10.192
On a tiny, forgotten island
in the Atlantic
called Isla Hundida.

18:10.296 --> 18:13.851
What I have not been
able to find is Kalaman's
final resting place.

18:13.954 --> 18:18.235
This piece of parchment
is the only clue we found
among the ruins.

18:18.338 --> 18:21.479
I need someone
who can decipher these symbols.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.654
I need you.

18:24.793 --> 18:26.243
Well...Miss Sage,

18:26.346 --> 18:29.729
surely this isn't how
you want your story to end.

18:29.832 --> 18:32.421
We both had our dreams crushed
by bad luck,

18:32.525 --> 18:34.768
or in my case,
an arse-kissing little brother,

18:34.872 --> 18:37.978
but this is our chance
to show them all.

18:38.082 --> 18:39.670
Come with me...
to the island.

18:39.773 --> 18:44.916
Translate these symbols
and help me find
the Crown of Fire.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.643
You can name your price.

18:50.267 --> 18:53.097
I must respectfully decline.

18:57.964 --> 18:59.172
Well...

19:00.794 --> 19:02.762
I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

19:03.659 --> 19:06.145
But I understand
how you feel.

19:09.493 --> 19:11.253
Will you at least let us
give you a ride?

19:11.357 --> 19:15.637
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll call for my own car,
and I'll just...

19:37.210 --> 19:40.972
I don't feel like
you're listening to me.
This is urgent, and we--

19:41.076 --> 19:44.010
Okay, so the police are saying
that they put out an APB...

19:44.113 --> 19:45.770
APB....on an SUV,

19:45.874 --> 19:48.117
and there's
this 24-hour rule...Why is there a rule?

19:48.221 --> 19:50.637
...and they won't
do anything until...What about the FBI or the CIA?

19:50.741 --> 19:52.708
-They said to call the police.
-I'm sure Loretta's fine.

19:52.812 --> 19:55.401
When I was in college,
my friend Nicki went missing.

19:55.504 --> 19:57.126
Everyone was, like,
freaking out.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.577
But then she was just
in her car.

19:59.681 --> 20:02.856
She was dead, but we found her.
She wasn't gone.

20:02.960 --> 20:07.309
Um, what about...
Maybe we could get a PI

20:07.413 --> 20:09.932
or, like, you know,
private security or--

20:10.036 --> 20:11.934
What about an extraction team,
like the movie?

20:12.038 --> 20:14.523
Yes! But who does that?
The ex-military, right?

20:14.627 --> 20:17.216
Oh, yeah. I think
I actually have somebody
that could help us.

20:17.319 --> 20:20.288
-Oh.
-I did this meditation retreat,

20:20.391 --> 20:22.462
and there was this
trainer guy there.

20:22.566 --> 20:24.084
You should
see this guy meditate.

20:24.188 --> 20:25.603
But he's ex-Navy SEAL.

20:25.707 --> 20:29.504
He-- He's a special ops trainer.
What was his name?

20:30.194 --> 20:31.333
Yeah. Jack Trainer.

20:31.437 --> 20:33.059
So he's a trainer
named Jack Trainer?

20:33.162 --> 20:35.337
That's how I have
everybody in my phone.
See, "Janice Mom."

20:35.441 --> 20:36.890
"Larry Doorknob."
"Stacy Butt Stuff."

20:36.994 --> 20:39.686
Look, this is
what this guy does.
He finds people.

20:39.790 --> 20:42.068
If there's anybody
that can help us, it's him.

20:49.006 --> 20:51.526
Jack Trainer.Oh, so his name
is actually Jack Trainer.

20:51.629 --> 20:55.530
Hi, uh, this is Alan
from "Touching Your Inner Self."

20:57.014 --> 20:58.843
The meditation retreat?

21:00.569 --> 21:03.641
Anyway, uh, okay.
Our friend Loretta
has been kidnapped,

21:03.745 --> 21:05.194
and no one's helping us.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.782
How long she been missing?

21:06.886 --> 21:08.128
Maybe two hours now.

21:08.232 --> 21:09.544
Who is that?

21:09.647 --> 21:13.686
Um, this is B--
This is Beth. I'm Beth.

21:13.789 --> 21:16.205
And Allison
is on too, sir.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.518
Did she have any
Wi-Fi-enabled devices?

21:18.622 --> 21:21.521
-She's got her phone, right?
-No, I have her phone.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.248
Oh! She has a smartwatch.
It ripped my wig off.

21:24.352 --> 21:27.286
What was that scenario?
Never mind. Open the phone.

21:27.389 --> 21:28.942
Go to the smartwatch app.All right.

21:29.046 --> 21:31.359
Then hit "Find My Smartwatch."

21:31.462 --> 21:34.396
Oh, my... That is so good.
That's why we called.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.950
"Anticipate the difficult
by managing the easy."

21:37.054 --> 21:40.747
Is that Oprah or Deepak? Laozi fromTao-te Ching.

21:40.851 --> 21:42.059
Oh, my God.

21:42.162 --> 21:43.854
It's in the Atlantic.

21:43.957 --> 21:46.305
She's on a plane?
How can you tell that?

21:46.408 --> 21:48.583
'Cause she can't swim
that fast.

21:48.686 --> 21:50.136
Doesn't sound like
a ransom scenario.

21:50.239 --> 21:52.863
My guess is blood sport,
Hunger Games type situation.

21:52.966 --> 21:55.797
Possibly some coke-fueled
dark web scavenger hunt.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.937
Real clown shit.
We'll have to move fast.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.974
-How do we pay you?
-Cryptocurrency. Cash App.

22:01.078 --> 22:04.564
I'll have her back
within 48 hours
or your next rescue is free.

22:04.668 --> 22:06.152
How many people
need a next rescue?

22:06.255 --> 22:07.774
More than you'd think.

22:07.878 --> 22:09.707
-I'm gonna need that phone.
-I'll bring it to you.

22:09.811 --> 22:12.572
Let me know where she lands.
I'll meet you there, Alan.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.623
Hello.

22:33.213 --> 22:34.353
Where am I?

22:34.456 --> 22:36.458
Um, you're on my plane.

22:36.562 --> 22:37.770
It's nice, isn't it? Hmm?

22:37.873 --> 22:39.703
The seats are made of
mama llama leather.

22:39.806 --> 22:42.913
Well, I'm getting off
your plane.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.397
Unchain me!

22:44.501 --> 22:46.054
That's your seat belt.

22:46.641 --> 22:48.505
Did you chloroform me?

22:48.608 --> 22:50.817
People actually do that?

22:53.199 --> 22:55.857
Well, you know,
it's a classic for a reason.

22:56.547 --> 22:57.790
My body feels drunk.

22:57.893 --> 22:59.792
It'll wear off in a bit.
I am sorry.

22:59.895 --> 23:02.311
I just couldn't wait around
for you to change your mind.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.866
Stop playing jelly.Time is not on our side.

23:04.969 --> 23:07.696
You see, the volcano
we're excavating around

23:07.800 --> 23:09.767
has developed
a bad case of indigestion.

23:09.871 --> 23:11.735
I'm rather worried
that when it blows,

23:11.838 --> 23:13.909
everything that's left
of the Lost City
will be destroyed.

23:14.013 --> 23:15.911
Oh, my God.
My legs don't work.

23:16.015 --> 23:21.434
So, this is our last chance
to find both the tomb
and the crown.

23:21.538 --> 23:23.574
Oh, God. Oh!

23:23.678 --> 23:25.956
Don't worry.
That's just our final descent.

23:26.059 --> 23:32.065
But it is the beginning
of the greatest adventure
of your life.

24:40.686 --> 24:42.757
Welcome to the Lost City.

24:52.387 --> 24:53.802
How did you find it?

24:53.906 --> 24:56.046
So, the city was built
on a lava dome.

24:56.149 --> 24:58.842
As the volcano became active,
the dome filled with lava,

24:58.945 --> 25:01.569
and sunken things
rose to the surface.

25:01.672 --> 25:03.571
The D exposed itself.

25:03.674 --> 25:06.712
-The entire city?
-No, no. Just the tip.

25:06.815 --> 25:10.025
As soon as I heard rumors
of the ruins, I flew over
and bought the place.

25:10.129 --> 25:13.408
The site?No. The island.
The southern half.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.859
I got a good deal
'cause this is where
the lava flows.

25:15.962 --> 25:18.206
We've been excavating
for a year now.

25:19.276 --> 25:21.830
One doesn't kidnap
a romance novelist
on day one.

25:21.934 --> 25:23.970
Ah, yes, as the saying goes.

25:24.074 --> 25:27.077
Rafi doesn't like it.
Do you, Rafi?

25:27.180 --> 25:30.356
He says
we're disrespecting
his heritage.

25:30.459 --> 25:33.704
But not a lot of other
job options on the island,
are there, Rafi?

25:33.808 --> 25:35.879
Beggars can't be choosers.

25:45.716 --> 25:47.546
No more charcuterie,
I take it.

25:47.649 --> 25:49.755
Mmm. Please.
I'm not a monster.

25:49.858 --> 25:51.688
Whatever you need, just shout.

25:53.206 --> 25:58.073
Uh, leave one hand free.
She has some translating to do.

25:59.281 --> 26:00.524
And then what?

26:00.628 --> 26:03.147
Loretta, I really wish
you would try and see

26:03.251 --> 26:05.391
what an exciting opportunity
this is for us.

26:05.494 --> 26:09.395
I believe this text describes
the exact location of the tomb.

26:09.498 --> 26:12.018
It's a logographic system.

26:12.778 --> 26:15.366
Like cuneiform or hieroglyphics.

26:15.470 --> 26:19.267
Now, if you have other documents
that possibly I can compare--

26:19.370 --> 26:20.648
Yeah, no luck there.

26:20.751 --> 26:23.547
We found some scratching
at a nearby waterfall,

26:23.651 --> 26:24.548
but it was useless.

26:24.652 --> 26:26.205
Just pictures of women.

26:26.308 --> 26:30.899
Look, I, too, wish
your dear old dead
archaeologist husband

26:31.003 --> 26:33.730
was here to help,
but he's not, so,

26:33.833 --> 26:36.940
time to shine, Loretta,
sex-book writer.

26:38.355 --> 26:40.081
They will come for me.

26:40.668 --> 26:42.393
Who, exactly?

26:42.497 --> 26:44.223
Your-- Your many cats?

26:44.326 --> 26:46.121
Oh, I don't have cats.

26:46.708 --> 26:48.537
Somehow even more sad.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.610
I have a hamster, asshole!

26:51.713 --> 26:53.370
You have a hamster's asshole?

26:53.473 --> 26:57.236
No, there was a--
there was a comma between--
Forget it.

26:57.339 --> 27:00.757

I believe this says

30:18.713 --> 30:20.715
"rest" or "resting."

30:20.819 --> 30:23.718
So it would be,
"Kalaman and his treasure..."

30:23.822 --> 30:28.309
And then
there are some missing pieces,
and then "rest," "resting,"

30:28.412 --> 30:31.830

"tears," so...

Miss Sage,
I need you to do better.

30:43.255 --> 30:46.706
Then next time
maybe don't kidnap
a romance novelist, hmm?

30:46.810 --> 30:49.019
My God,
this shouldn't be this hard!

30:49.123 --> 30:51.056
It is not some pauper's grave
we're looking for.

30:51.159 --> 30:53.437
It is a monument to a great man!

30:53.541 --> 30:55.474
King Kalaman was ambitious,
he was powerful,

30:55.577 --> 30:58.028
he was the first man
to build a city
in the Atlantic.

30:58.132 --> 31:00.789
The eyes of his subjects
would have turned to him.

31:00.893 --> 31:04.138
He would have had a pyramid,
a ziggurat, a tower

31:04.241 --> 31:06.209
to hold his Crown of Fire.

31:06.312 --> 31:09.212
All I need to know
is where it is.

31:09.315 --> 31:12.560
I don't know if you recall,
but you only said translate it.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.803
I-I translated it.

31:15.597 --> 31:17.185
Translate it again.

31:22.811 --> 31:25.849
One day, we're gonna
laugh about this.

31:25.953 --> 31:28.093
Such an adventure
we're having.

31:31.199 --> 31:35.548
I should go with you,
just for backup and awesomeness.

31:36.515 --> 31:38.172
This is pretty awesome.

31:38.275 --> 31:40.933
You got nature, the radio.

31:42.072 --> 31:45.696
Yeah, you're right,
but it's very, very important
to me

31:45.800 --> 31:47.664

31:47.767 --> 31:49.459

31:50.460 --> 31:52.669
No, I just brought snacks
and stuff.

31:52.772 --> 31:54.947
And she gets a little grumpy
when she's hungry.

31:55.051 --> 31:58.468
Blood pressure drops.
And I get that because I'm
a five-meal-a-day kind of guy.

31:58.571 --> 32:01.367

You look like you keto.

32:01.471 --> 32:03.162

You don't need it.

32:05.095 --> 32:06.579
What is it?

32:06.683 --> 32:10.273
I just want her to think of me
as more than a cover model.

32:10.376 --> 32:14.622
But, Alan,
you are so much more.
You're my lookout.

32:14.725 --> 32:18.074

where I put her in the car

37:56.619 --> 37:58.690
Gotta squeeze!
You got to do a Kegel
or something!

37:58.793 --> 38:01.175
-Kegel it!
-What do you think a Kegel is?

38:01.279 --> 38:03.660
I'm not in it, not in!
Still not in!

38:03.764 --> 38:06.145
-You got to go in more.
-Stop. Stop. Stop it!

38:06.249 --> 38:08.251
Oh, oh, oh!

38:08.355 --> 38:11.875
Oh, God. Get in the car,
get in the car!
Start the car! Start the car!

38:11.979 --> 38:13.256
-Go, go.
-Move your leg.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.672
Which one?Both of them! Move them!

38:19.435 --> 38:21.402
Forward, forward!Okay. Okay.

38:21.506 --> 38:25.820
-I'm going! I'm going! Okay!
-Drive!

38:26.959 --> 38:30.584
Shh. You're safe now. Shh.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.621
Ow.

38:33.725 --> 38:35.865
Shh. You're safe now.No, I'm not. Not safe.

38:35.968 --> 38:37.729
Oh, no, am I bleeding?

38:37.832 --> 38:40.835
-I don't think that's yours.
-Oh, no, that's a lot of blood.

38:42.147 --> 38:43.976
Cheese and rice!

38:44.080 --> 38:45.564
Are those his brains?What?

38:45.668 --> 38:47.635
I think his brains
are on my face!

38:47.739 --> 38:51.363
Definitely his brains
are in my mouth.
I can taste his thoughts!

38:51.467 --> 38:52.675
Focus on the road.

38:52.778 --> 38:54.918
He just liked
training people. Trainer.

38:55.022 --> 38:57.887
-What are you talking about?
-He loved me.

38:57.990 --> 39:00.579
Can you just scooch the car
over to the left?

39:00.683 --> 39:04.411
Get it off. Get it off.Oh, God.

39:04.514 --> 39:05.791
Watch out!

39:10.002 --> 39:12.902
Oh! Oh! Oh!

39:15.145 --> 39:16.906
Oh, did you see...

39:19.874 --> 39:20.910
No.

39:26.329 --> 39:27.641
Oh.

39:29.090 --> 39:31.403
Oh, no. Oh, no.

39:31.955 --> 39:33.440
Oh, no.

39:41.862 --> 39:43.415
Oh, no.

39:46.004 --> 39:49.594
Oh, holy Christmas.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

39:49.697 --> 39:51.768
Do you think you could
get me out of here?

39:51.872 --> 39:53.425
Yeah. Okay.

39:53.529 --> 39:56.428
You just flew out of the car.I did. I did, indeed.

39:56.532 --> 39:57.981
Okay. I got you.
I got you.

39:58.085 --> 40:00.536
Can you get me out of the chair?
Get me out of the chair.

40:00.639 --> 40:02.469
You're right.
You're right. You're right.

40:03.815 --> 40:05.644
Is that--
Is that a nail filer?Yeah.

40:05.748 --> 40:07.232
Can you just rip it?It's working.

40:07.335 --> 40:09.130
And maybe next time
I toss a gun at you,

40:09.234 --> 40:11.132
you can catch it
instead of ducking.

40:11.236 --> 40:14.446
How about the next time
you toss a gun at me,
you say, "Hey, Alan, catch"?

40:14.550 --> 40:16.414
Then maybe do that
before you throw it?

40:16.517 --> 40:18.623
Well, "here"
is a synonym for "catch."

40:18.726 --> 40:20.245
No, "here" is not a cinnamon
for "catch."

40:20.348 --> 40:22.420
In a colloquial kind of way,
yes, it is.

40:22.523 --> 40:24.629
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a sweatshirt.

40:24.732 --> 40:26.734
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a pen.

40:26.838 --> 40:29.910
How 'bout just,
"Hey! Catch! Gun!"

40:30.013 --> 40:33.016
Anything that you want
to throw, I'll catch it
because you said, "Catch."

40:33.120 --> 40:34.880
And I'll catch it
because you said it.

40:34.984 --> 40:37.400
That is also an option,
and then we would have a gun
with us.

40:37.504 --> 40:38.608
That's a thing.

40:38.712 --> 40:40.990
Be careful.Okay, we need to call--

40:41.093 --> 40:42.750
Be careful.

40:42.854 --> 40:45.373
We need to call for help,
get to the airport
and get out of here.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.479
And I am driving.Okay.

40:49.688 --> 40:52.553
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

41:02.287 --> 41:04.669
Okay, call for--
call for help.

41:04.772 --> 41:06.567
Where's your phone?

41:09.950 --> 41:10.985
Okay.

41:14.610 --> 41:17.440
-Tell me you caught them.
-I tagged the blond one.

41:19.097 --> 41:21.927
Oh, Loretta.

41:22.031 --> 41:24.102
What are you thinking?

41:24.205 --> 41:27.312
You might've killed one of them,
but his partner's
still with her.

41:27.415 --> 41:31.074
And he is clearly skilled,
highly trained

41:32.075 --> 41:33.732
and very dangerous.

41:43.535 --> 41:47.608
So, Miss Sage said
she was gonna leave the event,

41:47.712 --> 41:52.371
then got in a car
and left the event?

41:52.475 --> 41:55.167
-Did you try calling her?
-She doesn't have her phone.

41:55.271 --> 41:56.686
Stolen phone.Didn't say that.

41:56.790 --> 41:58.550
Where's my magnifier?

41:58.654 --> 42:00.656
Listen, can you please
help with Nana?

42:00.759 --> 42:03.141
I don't want her
hearing about Loretta
'cause it's going to upset her.

42:03.244 --> 42:06.316
-What about Loretta?
-Nothing, Nana.
She just went on a trip.

42:06.420 --> 42:07.697
Yeah.

42:07.801 --> 42:10.251
That girl needed
to get out of the house.

42:10.355 --> 42:14.532
So, this is the thing.
Loretta's phone is not stolen.
I took it.

42:14.635 --> 42:19.088
I gave it to Alan.
Alan then gave it to
the trainer, uh, Jack Trainer.

42:19.191 --> 42:21.469
And that is how we found
her wearable.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.264
And who's Alan?Dash.

42:23.368 --> 42:26.198
-What's that?
-He's the hero
in all of her books.

42:26.302 --> 42:29.339
-Nana. Hey, slut.
-Mm-mmm.

42:29.443 --> 42:32.377
Let's go in the other room
and talk about whichever war
you lived through.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.622
Okay. Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm sorry. It'll be fun.

42:35.725 --> 42:37.658
Listen,
Loretta Sage is missing.

42:37.762 --> 42:39.971
When I looked at her smartwatch,
it said that she had flown

42:40.074 --> 42:41.731
to some island
I've never even heard about.

42:41.835 --> 42:43.561
That means y'all need
to do something about this.

42:43.664 --> 42:46.046
And if you can't, I will,
and that won't look good
for you.

42:46.149 --> 42:48.876
Pretty sure that's
outside our jurisdiction.

42:48.980 --> 42:52.017
-You'd have to call the Feds.
-Okay.

42:52.121 --> 42:54.502
And if you do go to the Feds,
put in a good word for me.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.988
For me.For us.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.133
Oh, oh.

43:11.174 --> 43:13.418
What are you gonna do,
put the car back together?

43:13.521 --> 43:15.731
Well... we could--

43:31.643 --> 43:34.335
Where did you say the phone was?Passenger glove.

43:34.439 --> 43:36.199
What?Passenger glove compartment.

43:36.303 --> 43:37.545
Goodness.

43:38.650 --> 43:40.169
Oh, my God.

43:40.272 --> 43:42.516
Oh, my God. No phone, no car.
We're so gonna die out--

43:42.620 --> 43:44.345
Here.What is this?

43:44.449 --> 43:46.106
Boots for the jungle.

43:46.969 --> 43:48.798
It's not exactly
hiking boots, but...

43:48.902 --> 43:51.559
I figured your feet
would be killing you after
wearing heels for this long.

43:51.663 --> 43:54.010
It was the best we could do.
They're Allison's. Sorry.

43:54.804 --> 43:56.875
Oh. Okay, well, thank you.

43:56.979 --> 43:58.774
Here, oh, I got you cheese.

43:58.877 --> 44:00.672
Oh, my God.You got to stay hydrated.

44:00.776 --> 44:02.743
Thank you so much.They didn't have
glass bottles,

44:02.847 --> 44:04.849
so we'll definitely
hold onto it and recycle.

44:07.437 --> 44:12.132
Okay, so what we need to do
is find a phone, we need
to call the authorities,

44:12.235 --> 44:15.135
and we need to wait here
until somebody comes
and rescues us.

44:15.238 --> 44:18.759
Uh... This...
This is the rescue.

44:18.863 --> 44:20.140
No one else is coming.

44:20.243 --> 44:22.211
I'm sorry?I'm the rescue.

44:22.314 --> 44:25.248
It was originally just
gonna be me, then I was like,
Trainer should come.

44:25.352 --> 44:27.078
Oh, Trainer. Rest in peace.

44:27.181 --> 44:31.427
So, our best bet
is to get to the airport.
See this road right here?

44:31.530 --> 44:34.223
From this area,
just take a shortcut
through the jungle to the road.

44:34.326 --> 44:36.225
Did you just say "shortcut
through the jungle"?

44:36.328 --> 44:37.847
Yeah.Okay, do you see us?

44:37.951 --> 44:40.470
Uh-huh.You are not Dash,
and I'm not Lovemore. Okay?

44:40.574 --> 44:41.989
I'm Loretta, and you are Alan.

44:42.093 --> 44:44.405
And jungles
eat people like us, okay?Eat people.

44:44.509 --> 44:47.823
And I don't want to mess up
the jumpsuit. It's on loan.
So we're gonna stay put.

44:47.926 --> 44:49.859
We're not just gonna
stand around here, okay?

44:49.963 --> 44:51.343
We're gonna go
through the jungle,

44:51.447 --> 44:53.552
we're gonna go to the airport
and find a phone,

44:53.656 --> 44:56.659
-so you can have your cake
and get what you want.
-"And eat it too"?

44:56.763 --> 44:59.213
If that's what you want to do
with your cake, fine. Let's go.

44:59.317 --> 45:01.250
-That's the only thing you do
with cake.
-Not mine.

45:01.353 --> 45:03.804
I don't know
what your people do,
but my people eat it.

45:03.908 --> 45:06.117
You could give it
to someone as a gift.

45:06.220 --> 45:08.429
Those people
are still going to eat the cake.

45:08.533 --> 45:10.086
Everybody eats cake.

45:10.190 --> 45:12.019
What about the kind
people jump out of?

45:12.123 --> 45:15.057
They don't eat it,
when they're in it.Oh, my God.

45:41.359 --> 45:42.947
What did they
kidnap you for anyhow?

45:43.050 --> 45:44.914
Is it some weird sex stuff
like Taken?

45:45.018 --> 45:46.571
Oh, my God, thank you.

45:46.674 --> 45:49.401
I thought so too,
but the guy's one
of the Fairfaxes.

45:49.505 --> 45:51.334
Beverly?No, the older one.

45:51.438 --> 45:54.890
The really odd one
that had the vlog
on finding Montezuma's treasure.

45:54.993 --> 45:57.409
The dude that was on the news
for trying to raise the Titanic?

45:57.513 --> 45:59.308
Yes, he's looking for
the Crown of Fire.

45:59.411 --> 46:03.381
Wait a minute. Like the actual
Crown of Fire? Like the one...

46:03.484 --> 46:06.833
So those ruins were--They were
the Lost City of D, yes.

46:06.936 --> 46:09.249
What?
Are you kidding me right now?Shh.

46:09.352 --> 46:10.802
This is like your book.

46:10.906 --> 46:13.736
So we're basically
on a Lovemore and Dash adventure
right now?

46:13.840 --> 46:15.842
What is that?

46:15.945 --> 46:18.430
What if Fairfax
actually finds the crown?

46:18.534 --> 46:19.915
He won't. He won't.

46:22.089 --> 46:23.194
Where do we go?Uh...

46:23.297 --> 46:25.265
Oh, oh, oh.

46:28.337 --> 46:30.477
Okay, uh, we need
to get in the water.

46:30.580 --> 46:32.686
W-What?We need to go by river.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.619
No, no,
I don't really do water.

46:34.722 --> 46:37.070
What do you mean, "do water"?
I'm not asking you
to procreate with it.

46:37.173 --> 46:39.624
Uh, my body and water
don't really go together.

46:39.727 --> 46:42.075
How do you feel about dying?
Oh, God.

46:42.178 --> 46:44.042
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're okay. You're okay.

46:44.146 --> 46:46.976
I got you. Fine.I can swim. I can swim.
Thank you very much.

46:47.080 --> 46:49.151
Where are you going?I'm crossing.

46:49.254 --> 46:51.222
No, we have to stay
in the water.

46:51.325 --> 46:53.776
I researched
aquatic counter-tracking
for my book, A Year in the Bush.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.882
They'll lose our tracks
in the water.

46:55.985 --> 46:58.781
Why is it warm here?
Wait, are you peeing?

46:58.885 --> 47:00.887
Just go around it.

47:29.674 --> 47:31.193
Okay, I think...

47:31.296 --> 47:33.195
I think
we lost them, right?

47:33.298 --> 47:36.301
Yeah. That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.

47:36.405 --> 47:38.062
Okay, uh...

47:38.165 --> 47:40.581
Don't panic.What do you mean, don't panic?

47:40.685 --> 47:41.893
-Just don't panic.
-No.

47:41.997 --> 47:43.757
Stop saying "panic."
I'm panicking now.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.724
You have something
on your back.

47:47.243 --> 47:48.037
No!

47:48.141 --> 47:49.625
Stop screaming.What is that?

47:49.728 --> 47:50.971
What is that?Stop screaming.

47:51.075 --> 47:52.524
Do you have any on you?No. No.

47:52.628 --> 47:54.078
Why don't you have any
on you?

47:54.181 --> 47:55.976
Maybe the jumpsuit
scared them off.
I don't know.

47:56.080 --> 47:57.598
Get 'em off.Oh, my God.

47:57.702 --> 48:00.222
Okay. No, I can't touch
those blood-gorged mucous sacks.

48:00.325 --> 48:01.775
Can you fling it?Right now.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.259
Get it.Just pick it
and fling it.

48:03.363 --> 48:05.261
Just pick it and fling it.You pick it and fling it!

48:05.365 --> 48:07.436
Can you spin it off?Please, get it off.

48:07.539 --> 48:09.576
I don't like touching it.
I'm feeling faint.

48:09.679 --> 48:12.786
They're sucking my soul out.Okay, okay.
Stop, stop, stop.

48:14.443 --> 48:16.686
Don't make that sound.

48:20.276 --> 48:21.760
How many of them are there?

48:21.864 --> 48:23.383
Oh, there's not many.

48:23.486 --> 48:25.488
It feels like there's so many.What are you--

48:25.592 --> 48:26.904
I feel so many.Oh!

48:27.007 --> 48:29.561
Holy mother of God!Why are you praying?

48:29.665 --> 48:32.702
Is it that bad?
It can't be that bad.
Is it that bad? How many?

48:32.806 --> 48:34.049
It's not great.

48:34.152 --> 48:35.809
They're gonna suck
every bit of me out.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.570
Just please stop speaking.
I just need to--
need to get low.

48:38.674 --> 48:40.400
Hold on a second.

48:40.503 --> 48:43.299
Oh, God! I can feel them
just-- they're just
sucking out so much.

48:43.403 --> 48:46.268
I'm gonna be like
a shriveled-up skin sack
when they're done.

48:46.371 --> 48:48.339
You cannot tell my dad
I died this way, okay?

48:48.442 --> 48:52.481
You gotta tell him
I was wrestling an anaconda
with a sword or something.

48:52.584 --> 48:55.380
I'm like a blood Jamba Juice.
They're just sucking it all out.

48:55.484 --> 48:57.106
Why are they all
on my butt though?

48:57.210 --> 48:59.833
Kind of like picking anchovies
off my Caesar salad.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.662
-It's actually not so bad.
-Anchovies?

49:01.766 --> 49:03.354
Why do you go to food
right now?

49:03.457 --> 49:06.322
Just find the queen,
and let's be done with this.

49:06.426 --> 49:08.773
Think you're good.
I need to just check your front.

49:08.876 --> 49:11.120
Okay. I can't look.

49:13.364 --> 49:14.675
Is it bad?

49:14.779 --> 49:17.885
Uh, wow.What is it? Just say it.

49:17.989 --> 49:21.337
I mean, you expect it to,
you know, not...

49:21.441 --> 49:24.168
Then suddenly there it is,
and it is, uh...

49:24.271 --> 49:26.515
You know, you get excited
for a person.What?

49:26.618 --> 49:29.242
I mean,
I'm excited for all people.Why are you excited?

49:29.345 --> 49:31.658
Well, you know, people
wonder, they wonder,

49:31.761 --> 49:33.384
but they don't know, right?

49:33.487 --> 49:35.973
They don't,
until suddenly they do know,

49:36.076 --> 49:40.391
and then they--
they know something
that wasn't known before.

49:40.494 --> 49:42.358
Just--
Do I have any leeches or not?

49:42.462 --> 49:46.569
Oh, your plucky warrior hangs
in tranquil solitude.

49:46.673 --> 49:47.777
What?

49:47.881 --> 49:50.021
No, you're good.
You're good.

49:51.160 --> 49:52.886
We were so brave just then.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.233
Why do they go for the butt
so much?

50:16.530 --> 50:19.395
What's that song
you're singing?

50:19.499 --> 50:22.502
A song
my abbiused to sing to me
when I was a kid.

50:23.468 --> 50:26.126
"If you suck life
from the island...Yeah?

50:26.230 --> 50:29.026
...the island
will suck of you."

50:29.129 --> 50:33.064
Your grandma sang you songs
about getting sucked off
by an island?

50:33.168 --> 50:35.515
It doesn't translate
super well.

50:36.412 --> 50:39.243
Is phantom leech syndrome,
like, a thing?

50:39.346 --> 50:41.348
They don't lay eggs,
do they?

51:30.466 --> 51:31.674
Queen Taha?

51:45.274 --> 51:49.658
"King Kalaman
and his treasure laid to rest...

51:50.590 --> 51:54.249
laid to rest
in the well of endless tears.

51:54.352 --> 51:56.285
Laid to rest in
the well of endless tears."

51:56.389 --> 51:58.253
What does that mean?Loretta!

51:58.943 --> 52:00.669
You gave me
a heart attack.

52:01.359 --> 52:03.016
Where'd you go?

52:07.089 --> 52:08.642
What is this?

52:08.746 --> 52:11.990
I'm not sure,
but maybe they gathered here?

52:14.545 --> 52:17.203
Can you imagine
being right here,

52:17.306 --> 52:19.964
right in this very spot
back then?

52:20.067 --> 52:21.793
The stories
that they told?

52:21.897 --> 52:24.658
So much history I'm sure
happened right here.

52:29.974 --> 52:31.355
They've got us cornered.

52:31.458 --> 52:33.150
Okay. We've got to go up.
Come on.What?

52:33.253 --> 52:36.360
Have you seen what I'm wearing?
I'm in a glitter straitjacket.

52:36.463 --> 52:39.432
There's nowhere to go but up.
Come on. Let's go.

52:39.535 --> 52:43.090
Oh! I should not be doing this.
I'm too old for this.

52:43.194 --> 52:44.299
No, you're not.
You're beautiful.

52:44.402 --> 52:46.059
I didn't say I'm not beautiful.

52:46.163 --> 52:48.061
I said I'm too old
to be doing this.

52:48.165 --> 52:51.789
My skill is sitting and thinking
and eating when I can't think.

52:51.892 --> 52:54.309
Yeah, you definitely
could be wearing
better shoes for this.

52:54.412 --> 52:56.311
You brought me
these shoes.

52:56.414 --> 52:58.968
I can't go any further.
I can't go any further.

52:59.072 --> 53:00.798
I'm not doing
so great here.

53:00.901 --> 53:02.317
You got it. Come on.

53:02.420 --> 53:04.284
I know you think
that you're safer holding on,

53:04.388 --> 53:05.665
but you have to keep going.

53:05.768 --> 53:07.667
I can't. I can't, I can't.Okay?

53:08.461 --> 53:09.910
Do you smell that?Smell what?

53:10.014 --> 53:11.774
I smell something.Is it a predator?
What is it?

53:11.878 --> 53:13.811
A downward cascading fire?You got to smell deeper.

53:13.914 --> 53:15.088
I don't smell anything!

53:18.505 --> 53:21.750
Take a big, deep breath.

53:21.853 --> 53:23.165
All right.

53:23.269 --> 53:24.891
Good job.Okay.

53:24.994 --> 53:28.619
That was manipulative.
Thank you.Yeah, it was.

53:28.722 --> 53:31.208
Here we go. I'm gonna
help you out a little bit,
all right?

53:31.311 --> 53:33.382
-One, two, three... Here we go!
-What are you doing?

53:33.486 --> 53:34.866
Get out of there.Come on.

53:34.970 --> 53:37.041
No, no, don't flex.That's my hoo-hoo.

53:37.144 --> 53:40.078
Just ride the head.
Keep the hands moving
and ride the head.

53:40.182 --> 53:41.494
Oh, God.You're doing great.

53:41.597 --> 53:44.255
Sorry about
the scratchy haircut.
Come on.

54:04.344 --> 54:06.588
Dulcius ex asperis.

54:07.174 --> 54:08.555
What was that?

54:08.659 --> 54:10.177
Oh, nothing.

54:10.281 --> 54:12.525
It was just something
that John and I would say

54:12.628 --> 54:15.769
after we finished
something big, like a...

54:15.873 --> 54:17.840
like an archaeological dig
or a manuscript.

54:17.944 --> 54:21.258
It's Latin. It means
"sweeter after difficulty."

54:22.397 --> 54:23.777
What's...

54:23.881 --> 54:25.814
What's Latin
for "Loretta's a badass"?

54:25.917 --> 54:30.405
I am a badass.
I climbed a mountain.

54:30.508 --> 54:33.477
Oh, my God. I wish Beth
could've seen us do this.

54:33.580 --> 54:36.411
Oh, God. Beth.Don't worry about Beth.

54:36.514 --> 54:40.000
She's probably got
the whole navy
after us right now.

54:40.104 --> 54:43.176
I get that you think
you have to go to the island
authorities yourself,

54:43.280 --> 54:46.697
but don't worry, I'm keeping
Loretta's socials super active.

54:46.800 --> 54:49.182
Just tweeted,
"Did I just get kidnapped?

54:49.286 --> 54:52.806
#FML, @ShawnMendes,
#ShawnMendes."

54:52.910 --> 54:54.567
And you're traveling alone?

54:54.670 --> 54:57.501
Yes, I'm traveling alone.
Mm-hmm. I'm single.

54:58.087 --> 54:59.296
Then this might work.

54:59.399 --> 55:01.228
Okay! Talk to me.You'll hit New York.

55:01.332 --> 55:04.853
From there, you'll fly
to Guinea, where you can
pick up a puddle jumper.

55:04.956 --> 55:06.026
A what?

55:06.958 --> 55:08.443
Small plane.Yeah, no leg room.

55:08.546 --> 55:09.720
That's fine. I'll take it.

55:09.823 --> 55:11.860
Or you could just come home.Thank you.

55:19.730 --> 55:22.215
We need something
more flammable.
Everything is just so wet.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.837
What's in here?
What's in your bag?

55:23.941 --> 55:25.805
Uh...Oh, a lot. Okay.

55:25.908 --> 55:27.358
What are you doing?

55:27.462 --> 55:29.326
Okay. Face masks.

55:29.429 --> 55:30.844
Yeah, that was like
a gift-basket thing.

55:30.948 --> 55:32.915
You brought a scented candle
into the jungle?

55:33.019 --> 55:34.296
My mom gave me that.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.953
It was like a weird gift
for Mother's Day.

55:36.056 --> 55:38.335
Your mom gives you gifts
for Mother's Day?

55:39.646 --> 55:40.440
Noir--

55:40.544 --> 55:42.511
Eucalyptus rosemary oil.
Ooh.

55:43.098 --> 55:44.375
Oh, that smells good.

55:44.479 --> 55:46.653
Um-- Oh, okay. All right.

55:46.757 --> 55:48.379
Whoo! Yes!

55:48.483 --> 55:50.933
Yes, I made fire!

55:51.037 --> 55:54.592
-That's pretty impressive.
You have to--
-It is a beautiful fire.

55:54.696 --> 55:56.629
Who would have thought?

55:56.732 --> 55:59.217
Oh, you're just, um,
taking your shirt off?

56:00.322 --> 56:02.359
That looks
really uncomfortable.

56:02.462 --> 56:04.361
Are you okay? The back?

56:04.464 --> 56:08.537
Yeah. That is why
I don't do water.

56:08.641 --> 56:10.919
Okay.My body becomes
an eighth-grader's face.

56:11.022 --> 56:13.887
Do you have anything for it?
Like some ointment or something?

56:13.991 --> 56:15.889
Yeah, I do. Well, I did.

56:15.993 --> 56:18.064
It was in a little,
tiny little bottle.

56:18.167 --> 56:20.135
It was this. I'm sorry.

56:20.238 --> 56:22.275
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.725
It's okay.

56:23.828 --> 56:26.141
-Hold on. Yes.
Come here. Come here.
-What?

56:26.244 --> 56:28.661
-Come here. Sit down.
-Let me see.

56:28.764 --> 56:30.248
Just sit down.Right here?

56:30.352 --> 56:31.560
Yeah.

56:32.768 --> 56:34.391
Okay.

56:34.494 --> 56:36.358
Oh, no,
you don't have to touch it.
It's okay. It's fine.

56:36.462 --> 56:38.464
I touched
your engorged sacks, so...

56:40.673 --> 56:42.399
The leeches.Oh, okay.

56:42.502 --> 56:45.298
Okay, this might be
a little bit cold.

56:46.472 --> 56:48.197
Sorry.Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

56:48.301 --> 56:49.578
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

56:49.682 --> 56:51.649
Maybe this is how
Dash should die.

56:51.753 --> 56:54.790
Horrible eczema outbreak.
That's so sexy.

56:54.894 --> 56:56.413
I could make it work.

56:56.861 --> 56:57.897
Yeah?

56:58.553 --> 57:00.002
All right, then.

57:01.279 --> 57:03.005
How would you write this?

57:03.109 --> 57:04.593
Okay.

57:06.492 --> 57:09.805
"Warmed
by the fragrant fire..."

57:09.909 --> 57:12.359
Mm-hmm.

57:12.463 --> 57:14.361
Starting strong.Mm-hmm.

57:14.465 --> 57:17.572
"Lovemore's hands
explored the...

57:19.332 --> 57:21.817
the contoured scenery

57:21.921 --> 57:23.509
of Dash's body.

57:25.649 --> 57:28.341
Familiar terrain made

57:28.445 --> 57:30.792
new and exciting
with every...

57:31.724 --> 57:34.071
with every scarlet rim."

57:35.175 --> 57:36.867
And that didn't, uh...

57:37.695 --> 57:39.214
didn't turn her off?

57:39.317 --> 57:40.526
No.

57:41.354 --> 57:43.183
"Because with every
cardinal ridge,

57:44.184 --> 57:46.601
Lovemore discovered
another letter in the language

57:46.704 --> 57:48.810
that only their bodies spoke."

57:49.845 --> 57:51.882
And what were
their bodies saying?

57:53.849 --> 57:55.402
"Take me...

57:57.301 --> 57:58.923
take me,

57:59.510 --> 58:01.201
take me."

58:01.305 --> 58:02.617
How's that?

58:03.445 --> 58:04.722
It was good.

58:04.826 --> 58:06.552
Your back.
I mean, how is your back?Good.

58:06.655 --> 58:08.070
Okay. You sure?Yeah.

58:08.174 --> 58:12.730
I also meant my back.
Right there, yeah.Okay.

58:20.980 --> 58:22.015
Supplies.

58:24.155 --> 58:28.435
Okay, I'm chilly. I think
I'm gonna probably turn in
in a little bit.

58:28.539 --> 58:29.747
Okay.You good?

58:29.851 --> 58:32.509
Yeah, I'm fire-- fine.
I'm fine.

58:32.612 --> 58:35.546
I'm not "fire."
I'm fine by the fire.

58:36.236 --> 58:37.962
Okay. All right.

58:45.867 --> 58:49.180
Uh, it's up to you,
but if you're cold,

58:49.284 --> 58:53.495
maybe we could probably
both fit in here,
if you wanted to.

58:54.151 --> 58:55.877
Both of us?

58:55.980 --> 58:59.018
Only if you want to.
I mean, it's just--Yeah, no, that sounds...

58:59.121 --> 59:00.606
Uh...

59:00.709 --> 59:02.090
Okay. How do you...

59:02.193 --> 59:04.161
You can go first,
then I'll figure it out.

59:04.264 --> 59:07.405
No, no, you go.
It's definitely a "ladies first"
type of situation.

59:07.509 --> 59:10.167
Keep hands out of the bag
at all times.That's what I was gonna do.

59:10.270 --> 59:11.927
Butt to butt.Hands out and butt to butt.

59:12.031 --> 59:15.344
Yeah. What do I do?Just get in. Go ahead and sit.

59:15.448 --> 59:18.140
I sit first?
Okay. I'm in.

59:19.694 --> 59:22.282
You're too heavy.
You're gonna flip this thing
like a cruise ship.

59:22.386 --> 59:25.044
You watch yourself.
Hold on. I'm not in.

59:25.147 --> 59:28.323
Why is this engaging
my core so much?

59:29.117 --> 59:31.015
How 'bout you shimmy?

59:31.119 --> 59:33.224
I can't breathe.
I'm not breathing.Are you good?

59:33.328 --> 59:34.640
My face.

59:35.226 --> 59:36.469
Yeah. Okay.

59:39.576 --> 59:41.060
Hands are out. Butt to butt.

59:41.163 --> 59:42.199
Okay.

1:00:13.402 --> 1:00:14.990
Well!

1:00:15.094 --> 1:00:16.233
Come on.

1:00:16.336 --> 1:00:17.993
Come on! Let's hear it!

1:00:18.097 --> 1:00:21.583
Let's give
a nice round of applause
to Loretta!

1:00:21.687 --> 1:00:23.309
She earned it.

1:00:23.412 --> 1:00:27.278
A geriatric shut-in
left you holding your dicks
in the jungle.

1:00:27.382 --> 1:00:28.763
Good job, Loretta.

1:00:28.866 --> 1:00:31.386
Boss, come on.
People are dying now.

1:00:31.489 --> 1:00:35.148
Don't you think that maybe
this has all gone too far?

1:00:36.391 --> 1:00:38.117
Is it really worth it?

1:00:38.220 --> 1:00:41.603
I am on the cusp
of attaining the unattainable.

1:00:41.707 --> 1:00:44.710
Something singular,
something no nation,

1:00:44.813 --> 1:00:48.403
no emperor,
no brownnosing brothers
ever have.

1:00:48.506 --> 1:00:51.613
The legendary Crown of Fire.

1:00:52.062 --> 1:00:53.201
So, yes.

1:00:53.304 --> 1:00:55.617
Yes, I would definitely say
it's worth it.

1:01:05.351 --> 1:01:06.870
Excuse me!

1:01:06.973 --> 1:01:09.873
Excuse me, sir. I need to get
to my next connecting flight.

1:01:09.976 --> 1:01:11.322
No flight.

1:01:11.426 --> 1:01:14.015
The pilot is sick.
Come tomorrow.

1:01:14.118 --> 1:01:16.258
No, no, sir.
I cannot come tomorrow.
I need to do this today.

1:01:16.362 --> 1:01:21.091
I need to get to the island
Isla Hundida tonight.
Lives are at stake.

1:01:21.194 --> 1:01:22.679
Come tomorrow.

1:01:26.510 --> 1:01:28.201
Excuse me, miss?Yes?

1:01:28.305 --> 1:01:32.378
I couldn't help but overhear
you say that you like steak.

1:01:32.481 --> 1:01:35.761
Okay, this is
a little bit crazy,

1:01:35.864 --> 1:01:37.659
but I also like steak.

1:01:37.763 --> 1:01:40.110
What?I also like steak.

1:01:40.213 --> 1:01:43.665
Would you like to, maybe,
I don't know...

1:01:43.769 --> 1:01:46.599
-Maybe there's a--
-No. "Lives are at stake."

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:48.463
I need to go
to the island tonight.

1:01:48.566 --> 1:01:49.982
Ah.Yes.

1:01:50.085 --> 1:01:51.673
Even more serious.Extremely.

1:01:51.777 --> 1:01:54.780
Well, I believe
that I may be able
to assist you.

1:01:54.883 --> 1:01:56.816
I have a cargo plane.

1:01:57.990 --> 1:02:01.683
Maybe after I make my delivery,
we could swing by your island.

1:02:01.787 --> 1:02:04.582
I'm about to ask you something,
and you better
tell me the truth.

1:02:04.686 --> 1:02:06.550
Have you ever
murdered anyone before?

1:02:06.653 --> 1:02:09.898
No!

1:02:13.488 --> 1:02:16.215
I don't know if I really buy it,
but let me tell you something.

1:02:16.318 --> 1:02:20.564
If you ever think about
murdering me, I promise,
I will murder you first.

1:02:20.667 --> 1:02:22.014
My pleasure.

1:02:22.117 --> 1:02:24.257
You are weird. Let's go.

1:03:19.657 --> 1:03:23.075
"King Kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well

1:03:23.730 --> 1:03:25.146
of endless tears."

1:03:26.837 --> 1:03:28.011
What is that?

1:03:29.184 --> 1:03:32.636
Oh, it's a-- it's a thing.
I mean, it's not, uh...

1:03:32.739 --> 1:03:34.983
You know, it's not
what you think it is.

1:03:35.087 --> 1:03:38.884
So it's not Fairfax's fragment
of an ancient parchment?

1:03:38.987 --> 1:03:42.784
Okay.
It's what you think it is.

1:03:42.888 --> 1:03:44.337
Loretta, I thought
you were smarter than that.

1:03:44.441 --> 1:03:47.237
Fairfax is never
gonna stop hunting us now.

1:03:47.340 --> 1:03:48.341
What were you thinking?

1:03:48.445 --> 1:03:50.412
We have a volcano
that could bury the tomb

1:03:50.516 --> 1:03:54.071
before we get to it,
before we see it,
before we preserve its memory.

1:03:54.175 --> 1:03:56.108
This is--I'm sorry.
Is that what we're doing?

1:03:56.211 --> 1:03:58.731
'Cause no one told me.
When were you gonna tell me?

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:00.250
Why would I tell you?

1:04:00.353 --> 1:04:02.183
We're in this together.
I came here to rescue you.

1:04:02.286 --> 1:04:03.978
You know you're not Dash,
right?

1:04:04.081 --> 1:04:06.325
You don't ride in
on a white horse
to rescue people.

1:04:06.428 --> 1:04:10.708
You... spray yourself
with bronzer and you stand
in front of wind machines,

1:04:10.812 --> 1:04:12.331
which is great for you.

1:04:12.434 --> 1:04:15.092
How would you have any idea
what I'm actually like?

1:04:15.196 --> 1:04:18.130
I know you. You're
a pretty open book, Alan.

1:04:18.233 --> 1:04:20.028
-Okay, then who am I?
-Really?

1:04:20.132 --> 1:04:21.167
Yeah.

1:04:23.238 --> 1:04:25.447
O-- Okay, uh...

1:04:25.551 --> 1:04:28.657
You were a homecoming king
and you coasted
on your good looks to LA,

1:04:28.761 --> 1:04:31.281
but then realized that being
the most handsome kid
in the middle of nowhere

1:04:31.384 --> 1:04:33.110
doesn't mean
you're going to be a star.

1:04:33.214 --> 1:04:35.043
Until one day, when a woman
who couldn't publish her book

1:04:35.147 --> 1:04:38.736
on Spanish colonization
in the Atlantic decided
to write a romance novel,

1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:40.773
uh, chose you at random
to be on the cover.

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:44.294
Lucky for you and her,
the novels were
a smashing success.

1:04:44.397 --> 1:04:47.400
She kept writing her schlock,
you kept posing,

1:04:47.504 --> 1:04:52.958
um, you know,
neither one of us becoming
who we'd hoped we would be.

1:04:53.061 --> 1:04:57.169
Uh, and then one day,
we both die in the jungle

1:04:57.272 --> 1:05:01.173
on one of those Atlantic islands
I wrote about
all those years ago.

1:05:01.276 --> 1:05:02.312
Right?

1:05:03.658 --> 1:05:04.970
Mm-hmm.

1:05:16.257 --> 1:05:17.983
It was Sarasota, by the way.

1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:20.088
It's not nowhere.

1:05:20.192 --> 1:05:22.435
I grew up there with
my mom and two sisters.

1:05:22.539 --> 1:05:23.574
And yeah...

1:05:24.575 --> 1:05:27.268
I started modeling
'cause I wanted to get away.

1:05:27.371 --> 1:05:29.304
It was the only job
that I could think of

1:05:29.408 --> 1:05:32.652
that could take me
to all of the places
that I always dreamed of going.

1:05:32.756 --> 1:05:34.068
Then finally to Los Angeles,

1:05:34.171 --> 1:05:36.933
where I posed on the cover
of your romance novel.

1:05:37.036 --> 1:05:39.936
And I was so embarrassed
that one of my friends
might've seen me

1:05:40.039 --> 1:05:42.179
in that wig
on the cover of your book

1:05:42.283 --> 1:05:44.941
that I avoided talking to them
for months.

1:05:45.907 --> 1:05:47.391
And then one day,

1:05:48.116 --> 1:05:49.980
I'm walking home,

1:05:50.084 --> 1:05:52.879
and I hear this lady yell,
"Dash!"

1:05:52.983 --> 1:05:55.503
She runs up,
and she is so happy.

1:05:55.606 --> 1:05:59.369
Then I thought,
"How could I be this embarrassed

1:05:59.472 --> 1:06:02.165
about something
that makes people this happy?"

1:06:05.513 --> 1:06:07.204
Loretta, you can do
whatever you want.

1:06:07.308 --> 1:06:09.413
If you don't want to
write anymore,
don't write.

1:06:09.517 --> 1:06:14.004
But don't minimize the people
that love your work
by calling it schlock.

1:06:14.108 --> 1:06:16.662
That's not fair to them.

1:06:17.870 --> 1:06:20.769
You know what's ironic?
I thought you of all people
would know

1:06:20.873 --> 1:06:23.324
not to judge a book
by its cover.

1:06:27.397 --> 1:06:29.986
Judge a book
by its cover model.

1:07:01.465 --> 1:07:02.639
Alan?

1:07:02.742 --> 1:07:04.020
Alan.

1:07:15.997 --> 1:07:17.343
There's two of them.

1:07:23.453 --> 1:07:26.145
Loretta! I'm over here!Alan!

1:07:27.215 --> 1:07:30.287
Alan! Motorcycles and guns,
motorcycles and guns!

1:07:30.391 --> 1:07:32.531
Come on, this way!

1:07:32.634 --> 1:07:34.257
Stop shooting!

1:07:39.503 --> 1:07:41.471
Just give 'em the parchment!I can't.

1:07:41.574 --> 1:07:44.232
Yes, you can, actually.
You just say, "Here,"
and throw it at 'em.

1:07:44.336 --> 1:07:46.648
Right. And then I'm sure
they'll happily let us go.

1:07:46.752 --> 1:07:48.754
Okay, keep down.How do they keep finding us?

1:07:48.857 --> 1:07:51.343
You're basically
a walking disco ball.We need to come up with a plan.

1:07:51.446 --> 1:07:52.516
I have an idea.

1:07:52.620 --> 1:07:54.070
We're gonna dig a hole,
throw our voices.

1:07:54.173 --> 1:07:56.106
"We're over here."
Can you sound like a bird?

1:07:56.210 --> 1:07:58.522
No, I have a plan.Alan, please, I'm thinking.

1:07:58.626 --> 1:08:02.319
I know, but I have a plan.Please, just let me think
about...

1:08:02.423 --> 1:08:06.047
Wait a minute.
They're shooting at you.Yeah, that's why we're hiding.

1:08:06.151 --> 1:08:08.463
No. No, no, no.
They're shooting only at you.

1:08:08.567 --> 1:08:11.087
They won't shoot me.
It's my brain that's valuable.

1:08:11.190 --> 1:08:15.056
What? I don't think
you actually hear the things
you say sometimes.

1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:17.852
Maybe I can shield you.You are not shielding me.

1:08:17.955 --> 1:08:20.199
I should be shielding you.Why? Because I'm a woman?

1:08:20.303 --> 1:08:23.375
That's supremely sexist.Well, look, I don't think
using women as human shields

1:08:23.478 --> 1:08:26.205
is exactly the change
that Gloria Seinfeld
had in mind, do you?

1:08:26.309 --> 1:08:29.139
Gloria Steinem?Whatever. Her too.
You know what? Fine.

1:08:29.243 --> 1:08:32.315
Please mansplain sexism
to me right now.Oh, my God. I am a woman.

1:08:32.418 --> 1:08:34.524
I can't mansplain anything.

1:08:34.627 --> 1:08:39.356
Uh, I'm a feminist,
and I think a woman can do
anything a man can do.

1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:41.910
We just need to stay here
until they get tired.I have an idea.

1:08:42.014 --> 1:08:43.705
Please can I tell you
my plan?Alan!

1:08:43.809 --> 1:08:47.123
This is not a situation
you can get out of
by ripping your shirt off.

1:08:47.226 --> 1:08:49.159
Not my shirt.

1:09:20.604 --> 1:09:21.916
Three!

1:09:22.019 --> 1:09:23.607
-Yes!
-Oh!

1:09:27.715 --> 1:09:29.579
Oh.

1:09:29.682 --> 1:09:32.927
That was different
than I had in my head.

1:09:33.030 --> 1:09:37.103
I just wanted us to stop them.Could it have been the wind
that made it do that?

1:09:37.207 --> 1:09:39.313
No, I think it was us.
I think... we did it.

1:09:39.416 --> 1:09:41.832
We did the one guy, right?
But that was, like--

1:09:41.936 --> 1:09:45.284
We just wanted him to stop.
But I think the other guy
could've moved, really.

1:09:45.388 --> 1:09:47.528
So, that was--
that one was on him.

1:09:47.631 --> 1:09:50.496
Even if we weren't here,
that could've happened.

1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:52.326
Why are you gonna stop
next to a cliff?

1:09:52.429 --> 1:09:54.880
They were wearing helmets,
so maybe they're...

1:09:54.983 --> 1:09:57.158
But the rest of their body
didn't have a helmet.

1:09:57.262 --> 1:09:58.470
So there'd just be a head.

1:09:58.573 --> 1:10:00.851
They were driving
recklessly, right?

1:10:00.955 --> 1:10:02.681
Don't be mean on a bike.

1:10:03.371 --> 1:10:05.131
Don't do mean stuff on a bike.

1:10:08.928 --> 1:10:11.172
I mean,
perhaps they're fine.

1:10:11.276 --> 1:10:13.692
Yeah, probably not.
But that's okay.

1:10:13.795 --> 1:10:18.075
That's all right.
You know, things happen.
Let's go.

1:10:20.285 --> 1:10:23.460
-You gonna put it back together?
-It's on loan.

1:10:36.266 --> 1:10:38.579
Look at me.Okay.

1:10:39.476 --> 1:10:41.513
What more can I do,
you know?

1:10:41.616 --> 1:10:43.549
You've done so much already,
Beth.

1:10:43.653 --> 1:10:46.690
My poor, sweet, little Nana
has lost her sight.

1:10:46.794 --> 1:10:49.521
The book release
is a complete disaster,

1:10:49.624 --> 1:10:51.281
which I've leveraged
everything on,

1:10:51.385 --> 1:10:53.732
so I'm probably,
most definitely
broke right now.

1:10:53.835 --> 1:10:57.080
And most importantly,
I've lost a writer.

1:10:57.183 --> 1:10:58.737
Who does that?
Who loses a writer?

1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:03.362
Okay, Beth, you remind me
of my best friend, Randy.

1:11:03.466 --> 1:11:05.951
Always looking out
for other people,

1:11:06.054 --> 1:11:08.402
never taking care of herself.

1:11:09.403 --> 1:11:10.818
Isn't that right, Randy?

1:11:13.338 --> 1:11:15.201
She's like my therapist,
this one over here.

1:11:15.305 --> 1:11:17.411
LOL. "Laughing Out Loud."

1:11:17.514 --> 1:11:19.482
After you take care
of your friend,

1:11:20.379 --> 1:11:21.725
how about we go to a beach?

1:11:21.829 --> 1:11:24.314
What?Look, I have a pickup
in Hawaii.

1:11:24.418 --> 1:11:26.385
She doesn't have to come.

1:11:26.489 --> 1:11:29.285
-Okay! Okay, you can come!

1:11:29.388 --> 1:11:31.390
She's hilarious.

1:11:32.184 --> 1:11:34.013
Let me ask you something.

1:11:34.117 --> 1:11:36.222
We're all sitting here
chitchatting,
but who's flying the plane?

1:11:36.326 --> 1:11:38.259
Autopilot.What?

1:11:38.363 --> 1:11:41.089
Sir, go to the cockpit,
fly the plane.

1:11:41.538 --> 1:11:42.539
Okay.

1:11:43.299 --> 1:11:45.059
I'm going to
go land the plane.

1:11:45.162 --> 1:11:46.612
Okay.

1:11:46.716 --> 1:11:48.614
No, no, no. Take the goat.
Please, take the goat.

1:11:48.718 --> 1:11:51.376
She's on break.
Enjoy the flight!

1:12:26.790 --> 1:12:28.136
Hi.Hola.

1:12:32.589 --> 1:12:35.281
This English dude came in
and basically kidnapped her.

1:12:37.422 --> 1:12:40.735
Hey, it's Beth.
Please leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.

1:12:40.839 --> 1:12:43.704
Uh, hi, Beth.

1:12:43.807 --> 1:12:44.808
It's me.

1:12:44.912 --> 1:12:46.741
Uh, I'm alive!

1:12:47.466 --> 1:12:49.503
Uh, listen, um...

1:12:50.814 --> 1:12:51.850
Uh...

1:12:53.299 --> 1:12:57.407
I'm sorry that I
blew up the book tour.

1:12:57.511 --> 1:12:59.236
Um...

1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:01.722
I was just afraid

1:13:02.861 --> 1:13:04.518
and selfish. Uh--

1:13:04.621 --> 1:13:07.348
Oh, here comes Alan.
I'll call you back.

1:13:10.524 --> 1:13:13.527
So, uh, police
are searching for Fairfax,

1:13:13.630 --> 1:13:16.081
and they're gonna provide us
protection while we're here.

1:13:16.184 --> 1:13:18.014
Did they say
how long we'd be here?

1:13:18.117 --> 1:13:20.775
They're gonna try to get us
on a puddle jumper
later this evening.

1:13:20.879 --> 1:13:23.088
But, uh,
they said in the meantime,
the inn is really nice,

1:13:23.191 --> 1:13:25.780
and we can get cleaned up
and maybe a change of clothes.

1:13:25.884 --> 1:13:27.299
Okay.

1:13:30.751 --> 1:13:32.304
Okay. Yeah.

1:14:25.081 --> 1:14:26.531
Thank you.

1:14:27.117 --> 1:14:30.362
Come on.

1:14:30.466 --> 1:14:31.708
Dance with your husband.

1:14:31.812 --> 1:14:33.607
No, no, no.He's not my husband.

1:14:33.710 --> 1:14:35.436
It's okay.Dance with him.

1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:38.025
No, no. She doesn't want to.
She doesn't have
the right shoes.

1:14:38.128 --> 1:14:40.648
Actually, it's the only thing
these shoes are right for.

1:14:40.752 --> 1:14:42.995
You don't have to do this.

1:14:43.099 --> 1:14:44.859
It's okay. It's okay.

1:14:45.757 --> 1:14:46.723
Yeah?

1:16:05.353 --> 1:16:07.045
I wonder
what she's saying.

1:16:09.426 --> 1:16:10.911
It's folklore.

1:16:12.326 --> 1:16:14.362
Love song about a woman

1:16:14.466 --> 1:16:17.780
whose lover died,
and she didn't want to
leave his side.

1:16:18.815 --> 1:16:21.646
So she laid down
and refused to get up.

1:16:22.232 --> 1:16:23.993
Must be scary.

1:16:24.096 --> 1:16:27.997
Having to face your future
without the person
that you planned it with.

1:16:40.354 --> 1:16:41.907
What was that?

1:16:44.047 --> 1:16:47.706
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The, um-- the last line
that you sang.

1:16:47.810 --> 1:16:50.157
¿Quién llorará junto a mí?

1:16:53.091 --> 1:16:55.921
"The island will weep for me
in the well of endless tears."

1:16:56.025 --> 1:16:59.407
What is that,
the well of endless tears?
Is that a real place, or...

1:16:59.511 --> 1:17:01.133
Sinkhole place.

1:17:02.928 --> 1:17:04.654
Thank you. Gracias, gracias.

1:17:04.758 --> 1:17:06.829
Come here, come here.What is it?

1:17:08.451 --> 1:17:10.280
Hey, on the parchment,
it said,

1:17:10.384 --> 1:17:14.457
"King Kalaman
and his treasure laid to rest
in the well of endless tears."

1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:16.666
I thought
maybe it was a metaphor.

1:17:17.184 --> 1:17:18.737
It's not.

1:17:18.841 --> 1:17:21.706
The Well of Endless Tears
is a place.

1:17:21.809 --> 1:17:23.811
It's a sinkhole.

1:17:23.915 --> 1:17:26.089
There's a sinkhole
on the map.

1:17:27.435 --> 1:17:29.196
I think the tomb is there.

1:17:29.299 --> 1:17:31.681
This is so much better
than your books.What?

1:17:31.785 --> 1:17:33.269
There's like--
No, I don't mean any offense.

1:17:33.372 --> 1:17:35.271
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.It's, like, equal.

1:17:35.374 --> 1:17:37.583
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.Look at you.
You want to go there.

1:17:37.687 --> 1:17:39.551
What? No.I can see. Yes, you do.

1:17:39.655 --> 1:17:42.761
That would be insane.
That would be insane.
I just-- I just--

1:17:42.865 --> 1:17:47.248
It's just that
we're so close to it,
but, you know, we can't--

1:17:47.352 --> 1:17:48.664
No.

1:17:48.767 --> 1:17:51.459
This is your story.
How do you want to write it?

1:17:52.253 --> 1:17:54.566
I'd like to know
that it's there,

1:17:54.670 --> 1:17:56.326
that all this
meant something.

1:17:56.430 --> 1:17:58.294
Okay. Then let's go.

1:17:58.397 --> 1:18:00.261
We'll stay one more day.
As soon as the sun's up,

1:18:00.365 --> 1:18:02.125
we're gonna go find
the Well of Endless Tears.

1:18:02.229 --> 1:18:05.094
But what if it's nothing?So what? Then we say we tried.

1:18:05.197 --> 1:18:06.440
And Fairfax?

1:18:06.543 --> 1:18:08.960
The cops are after Fairfax.
Don't worry about him.

1:18:10.064 --> 1:18:10.858
This is crazy.

1:18:10.962 --> 1:18:12.653
Yeah, but look at you.What?

1:18:12.757 --> 1:18:15.725
It's the very first time
I've ever seen you
totally unafraid.

1:18:16.346 --> 1:18:18.072
And alive.

1:18:18.176 --> 1:18:20.696
I'm gonna go tell them
our plans have changed
and find us a ride.

1:18:20.799 --> 1:18:22.249
Where are you going?

1:18:25.908 --> 1:18:27.979
I see you met
my friend here.

1:18:28.082 --> 1:18:32.466
He told me you were just
about to jump on a plane,

1:18:32.569 --> 1:18:35.020
without so much as
saying goodbye.

1:18:35.124 --> 1:18:38.541
I said, "No way.
Not my Loretta.

1:18:38.644 --> 1:18:43.097
Not when she's the only one
who can lead me to the tomb."

1:18:46.514 --> 1:18:48.585
Stop squeezing so hard.

1:18:49.414 --> 1:18:52.210
Ow. Get your hands off of me!

1:18:53.073 --> 1:18:54.937
Ow! Let go!

1:18:55.420 --> 1:18:56.628
I-I need a car.

1:18:56.732 --> 1:18:58.664
A car, an auto.
Does anybody have an auto?

1:19:07.156 --> 1:19:08.226
No, no. No.

1:19:08.951 --> 1:19:10.262
I-I-I need an auto.

1:19:10.366 --> 1:19:11.712
I'll trade you my watch.

1:19:11.816 --> 1:19:13.231
It's a really expensive watch.
Do you have a car?

1:19:13.334 --> 1:19:14.853
It's a Bulgari.
This thing glows in the dark.

1:19:14.957 --> 1:19:16.752
It's waterproof.I have motorcycle.

1:19:30.351 --> 1:19:32.112
Cool, isn't it?

1:19:32.215 --> 1:19:35.322
I always thought,
why can't your personal tank
also have a minibar?

1:19:35.425 --> 1:19:36.910
Have a drink.

1:19:37.013 --> 1:19:38.566
Do you mind?

1:19:38.670 --> 1:19:40.085
Uh, yes.

1:19:40.189 --> 1:19:42.329
He has a bit of a grudge
against you, I'm afraid.

1:19:42.432 --> 1:19:45.228
Something about
a motorbike accident
his friends had?

1:19:45.332 --> 1:19:46.505
Why are you doing this?

1:19:46.609 --> 1:19:48.369
I want something
nobody else has.

1:19:49.267 --> 1:19:51.096
When my father gifted--

1:19:54.168 --> 1:19:55.687
As I was saying,

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:58.724
when my father gifted
his empire

1:19:58.828 --> 1:20:01.279
-to my baby brother--

1:20:08.320 --> 1:20:09.839
Who is that?

1:20:18.572 --> 1:20:20.781
Is that a Ken doll
on a moped?

1:20:21.575 --> 1:20:23.094
I know him from somewhere.

1:20:23.197 --> 1:20:24.854
Oh, I-I-I doubt that.

1:20:24.958 --> 1:20:27.167
Because what
you are looking at

1:20:27.270 --> 1:20:30.170
is a highly trained
combat specialist,

1:20:30.273 --> 1:20:33.863
forged in the furnaces
of Afghanistan, Iraq,

1:20:33.967 --> 1:20:36.555
Kuwait, Sa-- Sarasota...

1:20:36.659 --> 1:20:38.730
Incredible skin.
No eczema problems.

1:20:38.834 --> 1:20:42.527
And he will not stop
until I am safe!

1:20:42.630 --> 1:20:44.840
So you pull
this space tank over,

1:20:44.943 --> 1:20:48.084
unless you would like to perish
like his friends did.

1:20:48.188 --> 1:20:51.605
And he is responsible
for their perishment.

1:20:51.708 --> 1:20:54.401
He might not have meant to,

1:20:54.504 --> 1:20:57.783
but they... perished, so...

1:21:12.729 --> 1:21:13.972
Okay, who-who is this?

1:21:14.076 --> 1:21:15.974
I have seen him
somewhere before.

1:21:18.459 --> 1:21:19.702
No, no, no.

1:21:19.805 --> 1:21:21.531
That's your cover model,
isn't it?

1:21:21.635 --> 1:21:23.913
Yes. I knew
I knew him from somewhere.

1:21:24.810 --> 1:21:25.881
Get up there.

1:21:25.984 --> 1:21:27.365
And kill him creatively.

1:21:27.468 --> 1:21:29.574
I love watching hunks fail.

1:21:31.921 --> 1:21:34.165
I guess I-I will
have that drink.

1:21:35.856 --> 1:21:37.133
Oh, shit.

1:21:37.237 --> 1:21:39.791
Is it okay
if I just top 'er off?

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:41.068
Yeah, that's fine, but--

1:21:41.172 --> 1:21:43.139
Oh, my God,
have you used a glass before?

1:21:43.243 --> 1:21:44.589
Sorry.

1:21:44.692 --> 1:21:46.177
What would
Jack Trainer do?

1:21:48.386 --> 1:21:49.456
It's hot in here.

1:21:49.559 --> 1:21:52.562
Anyone else feeling
how hot it is?

1:21:52.666 --> 1:21:53.736
Are you trying to be sexy?

1:21:53.839 --> 1:21:55.634
This is very weird.
Please, stop.

1:21:55.738 --> 1:21:57.636
I could set your world
on fire.

1:22:08.233 --> 1:22:10.546
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

1:22:10.649 --> 1:22:12.375
Go to sleep! Sleep!

1:22:14.791 --> 1:22:16.621
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:22:16.724 --> 1:22:18.002
Time-out.

1:22:18.105 --> 1:22:19.037
Time-in!

1:22:24.870 --> 1:22:27.701
No! Don't shoot her!
I need her!

1:22:29.358 --> 1:22:31.222
Oh, Jesus!

1:22:31.325 --> 1:22:32.740
Ow, ow, ow.

1:22:36.675 --> 1:22:39.092
Move your foot! Move your foot!

1:22:42.164 --> 1:22:44.373
-Go to sleep, asshole.

1:22:44.476 --> 1:22:46.133
Get out there! Look!

1:22:50.724 --> 1:22:52.036
A bigger guy?

1:22:52.139 --> 1:22:53.347
Oh, no.

1:22:54.693 --> 1:22:55.936
What?

1:22:58.421 --> 1:22:59.353
Move it!

1:23:01.079 --> 1:23:03.392
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1:23:04.289 --> 1:23:06.188
Hey! Get in.

1:23:06.705 --> 1:23:07.810
Him or me?

1:23:11.917 --> 1:23:16.715
This is not one of
your cheap, vapid
lady-fantasy books, Loretta.

1:23:16.819 --> 1:23:18.786
This is real life.

1:23:19.718 --> 1:23:21.582
And we will kill him.

1:23:21.686 --> 1:23:23.412
Tell us where the tomb is.

1:23:38.082 --> 1:23:39.393
Hi.
So, whoever's in charge,

1:23:39.497 --> 1:23:42.120
I need you to send
officials to go here.

1:23:42.224 --> 1:23:43.328
Here.

1:23:44.467 --> 1:23:46.297
We are closed.

1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:47.746
You're closed?

1:23:49.679 --> 1:23:52.786
You know I've been
trying to take a nap
for a year and a half?

1:23:52.889 --> 1:23:54.443
A year and a half.

1:23:55.375 --> 1:23:58.481
I have been burning the candle
at both ends,

1:23:58.585 --> 1:23:59.931
the midnight oil,

1:24:00.035 --> 1:24:03.003
since way before
my friend got kidnapped.

1:24:03.107 --> 1:24:04.970
And all I want to do

1:24:05.523 --> 1:24:07.663
is kick my feet back

1:24:07.766 --> 1:24:09.009
and drink some wine

1:24:09.113 --> 1:24:11.494
that I'm probably
too tired to drink.

1:24:11.598 --> 1:24:13.531
And I want a massage.

1:24:13.634 --> 1:24:18.294
I want someone to massage
my shoulders and my feet,

1:24:18.398 --> 1:24:20.434
and I want it at the same time.

1:24:20.538 --> 1:24:24.231
And I don't care if logistically
that doesn't make sense.

1:24:24.335 --> 1:24:26.992
Because I have worked hard.

1:24:27.855 --> 1:24:30.306
The same way that
I know that you have.

1:24:31.204 --> 1:24:33.413
So I hate to ask you

1:24:33.516 --> 1:24:35.898
to leave this place open
a few more minutes,

1:24:36.001 --> 1:24:37.934
because if we don't,

1:24:38.038 --> 1:24:41.593
a very close friend of mine
and her cover model

1:24:41.697 --> 1:24:43.457
are going to die.

1:25:06.308 --> 1:25:07.861
No good way in, boss!

1:25:07.964 --> 1:25:10.105
What about the caves?

1:25:10.864 --> 1:25:12.210
That's too dangerous!

1:25:12.314 --> 1:25:15.317
Well,
we'll be very careful then.

1:25:28.882 --> 1:25:30.194
Well, come on!

1:25:34.888 --> 1:25:36.717
This way.I have a rule about

1:25:36.821 --> 1:25:38.340
not going into
super creepy caves.

1:25:49.696 --> 1:25:52.630
Julian?
His name is Julian?

1:25:52.733 --> 1:25:55.598
He seems more like
a Buck or a Bruce.

1:25:55.702 --> 1:25:57.186
Lead the way.

1:26:00.879 --> 1:26:03.261
Go on. Don't be scared.

1:26:33.015 --> 1:26:34.810
Watch your step there.

1:26:34.913 --> 1:26:36.087
Bruce!

1:26:36.191 --> 1:26:37.192
Julian. Oh, no!Julian!

1:26:37.295 --> 1:26:38.917
Whoa.

1:26:39.021 --> 1:26:40.540
Whoa.

1:26:41.196 --> 1:26:42.680
Well...

1:26:43.508 --> 1:26:45.234
Let's not have
his death be in vain.

1:26:45.338 --> 1:26:48.099
-Onward and upward.
-What do you mean onward?

1:26:48.203 --> 1:26:50.653
We're not gonna go
and get him now, are we?

1:26:50.757 --> 1:26:52.172
Oh, man.

1:27:04.564 --> 1:27:06.221
Okay.

1:27:06.324 --> 1:27:09.016
Yeah. Look, let's just
go back to the boat.

1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:10.984
This is over.
Nobody else has to die.

1:27:11.087 --> 1:27:13.262
No, no, no. Ha-ha!
It's a breeze.

1:27:13.366 --> 1:27:15.816
There's a tunnel.
This could lead to the tomb.

1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:17.784
That's not person-sized.Ah, speak for yourself.

1:27:17.887 --> 1:27:20.165
Come on.
It's practically
a kiddie slide.

1:27:20.269 --> 1:27:22.582
More like
a rock sphincter.Or a troll anus.

1:27:22.685 --> 1:27:25.067
All right, well, you are
going through the anus--

1:27:25.170 --> 1:27:26.482
the hole-- the tunnel!

1:27:26.586 --> 1:27:28.588
Why her?You are our canary
in the coal mine.

1:27:28.691 --> 1:27:30.106
No, that's impossible.
I can't.

1:27:30.210 --> 1:27:31.660
Please let us know
if you get through.

1:27:31.763 --> 1:27:34.076
If we don't hear from you,
Fabio's got to die.

1:27:34.179 --> 1:27:36.354
Wait,
I'm the damsel in distress?

1:27:37.044 --> 1:27:38.287
It's okay. I'm fine.

1:28:14.323 --> 1:28:16.774
I can't.
I'm so sorry. I can't.

1:28:16.877 --> 1:28:18.603
-Hey.
-What?

1:28:19.328 --> 1:28:21.296
Hey, you smell that?

1:28:21.399 --> 1:28:24.333
You mean centuries
worth of bat feces?
Yes, I definitely smell that.

1:28:24.437 --> 1:28:26.646
You gotta take
a big breath for me.

1:28:31.754 --> 1:28:33.135
There you go.

1:28:33.238 --> 1:28:35.102
You can do it, Loretta.

1:28:48.046 --> 1:28:50.808
I think I see a way out.

1:28:54.363 --> 1:28:56.572
Oh, cheese and rice!

1:29:01.266 --> 1:29:02.613
I made it!

1:29:02.716 --> 1:29:04.200
I made it!

1:29:04.304 --> 1:29:06.789
-See? Totally safe.

1:29:07.790 --> 1:29:08.860
Go on. Your turn.

1:29:10.552 --> 1:29:13.451
I'm coming through!
Be right there, okay?

1:30:17.619 --> 1:30:19.759
Why would they
build this here?

1:30:20.863 --> 1:30:22.589
But how is anyone
supposed to worship

1:30:22.693 --> 1:30:24.384
or remember you
if they can't even see it?

1:30:24.488 --> 1:30:26.351
They aren't.

1:30:26.455 --> 1:30:29.424
This isn't a monument
to Kalaman's power.

1:30:30.528 --> 1:30:33.117
It's a hiding place
for a grieving woman.

1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:36.672
Taha came here
to be with her fallen lover.

1:30:38.329 --> 1:30:39.779
She just wanted
to be alone.

1:30:41.436 --> 1:30:42.954
Taha doesn't want us here.

1:30:43.058 --> 1:30:44.404
God, shut up, Rafi.

1:30:44.508 --> 1:30:46.371
It's just the volcano.

1:30:48.028 --> 1:30:49.340
Come on.

1:30:54.483 --> 1:30:56.140
We have to keep going.

1:31:04.320 --> 1:31:05.977
All right.
Let's go, Muscles.

1:31:06.771 --> 1:31:08.601
Open it up.

1:31:08.704 --> 1:31:11.155
-Don't disturb them.
-She will be wearing
the headdress.

1:31:11.258 --> 1:31:13.847
Come on.
We didn't come all this way
just to pay our respects.

1:31:13.951 --> 1:31:15.608
I can't, um...

1:31:18.369 --> 1:31:20.578
Uh...I'm sorry, abuela.

1:31:41.806 --> 1:31:43.118
What is that?

1:31:45.258 --> 1:31:47.674
Are those... seashells?

1:31:48.433 --> 1:31:51.298
The crown is made of seashells?

1:31:51.402 --> 1:31:52.955
Where's the treasure?

1:31:53.956 --> 1:31:55.406
She's holding him.

1:31:58.202 --> 1:31:59.962
You mean the dead guy?

1:32:06.486 --> 1:32:07.694
Look.

1:32:09.696 --> 1:32:11.422
It's their courtship.

1:32:11.526 --> 1:32:15.426
Kalaman is searching the island
for something.

1:32:18.256 --> 1:32:19.844
Rare red seashells.

1:32:19.948 --> 1:32:24.953
To prove his love,
he gave her one shell
every day for a year

1:32:25.056 --> 1:32:26.610
and made them into a crown,

1:32:26.713 --> 1:32:29.509
bright red like
the flame of their love,

1:32:29.613 --> 1:32:32.995
until the day came
where she accepted his proposal.

1:32:33.099 --> 1:32:34.859
It was never about jewels.

1:32:34.963 --> 1:32:38.691
Kalaman and Taha's riches
weren't material.

1:32:40.624 --> 1:32:42.557
It was their love.

1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:45.007
That's what it meant.
That was enough.

1:32:45.111 --> 1:32:46.319
So that's it?

1:32:47.216 --> 1:32:50.116
All of that time
and money

1:32:50.944 --> 1:32:54.534
spent on, what,
just a cheap metaphor?

1:32:54.638 --> 1:32:57.433
It's a pretty rich metaphor.Oh, shut up!

1:32:57.537 --> 1:32:59.574
-We got to go. We got to go now.

1:32:59.677 --> 1:33:02.853
-Come on. Let's go.
-No, no, no.
You are staying here.

1:33:02.956 --> 1:33:05.027
You think it's all
so sweet and poetic.

1:33:05.131 --> 1:33:07.616
Well, then you can stay here
and spend your last moments

1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:10.654
pondering the richness
of that metaphor.

1:33:11.344 --> 1:33:13.622
-Get in.
-What? Come on, man.

1:33:13.726 --> 1:33:16.176
-Oh, God. Just get in.
Get in the tomb.
-Okay, okay.

1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:18.903
It's better
to be buried alive
than buried dead, I guess.

1:33:19.007 --> 1:33:22.286
-It's really not.
-You know, it is a shame,
really.

1:33:22.389 --> 1:33:23.908
This is a hell of a story.

1:33:24.012 --> 1:33:26.704
Pity you won't be around
to tell it. Come on.

1:33:26.808 --> 1:33:28.395
-But they'll die.
-So will you

1:33:28.499 --> 1:33:31.088
if you don't stop
being such a snowflake!
Get over here!

1:33:40.684 --> 1:33:42.686
This is fine.
This is not an active nightmare

1:33:42.789 --> 1:33:44.446
I've had since
I was 14 years old.

1:33:47.794 --> 1:33:51.522
Why are you going so fast?
It's not a race.

1:33:56.527 --> 1:33:58.840
Wait, no! What are you doing?
Come back here!

1:33:58.943 --> 1:34:03.638
You may have bought the island,
but now the island owns you!

1:34:04.500 --> 1:34:05.985
You can't just
leave me here!

1:34:08.021 --> 1:34:10.403
Rafi! Come back!

1:34:12.577 --> 1:34:13.993
I need a boat!

1:34:23.416 --> 1:34:25.521
Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

1:34:27.523 --> 1:34:29.387
Help! Help!

1:34:29.491 --> 1:34:31.596
One of the locals
just stole my boat!

1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:33.460
Have you seen a woman?

1:34:33.564 --> 1:34:36.671
She's a brunette
in a sequined jumpsuit.

1:34:36.774 --> 1:34:40.778
No. Is she in some sort
of trouble?

1:34:52.445 --> 1:34:54.171
It's kind of funny.

1:34:55.586 --> 1:34:57.381
I used to think this...

1:34:57.484 --> 1:34:59.383
this sort of thing
was so romantic.

1:34:59.486 --> 1:35:00.867
Yeah?

1:35:00.971 --> 1:35:04.319
Being locked in a coffin
about to be buried by lava,

1:35:04.422 --> 1:35:07.011
or... cuddling dead people?

1:35:07.805 --> 1:35:10.877
Just laying down
with a lost love.

1:35:10.981 --> 1:35:12.189
Like Taha did.

1:35:14.743 --> 1:35:15.951
God.Oh...

1:35:16.538 --> 1:35:17.919
Oh, God.

1:35:18.022 --> 1:35:20.231
I'm sorry.

1:35:20.335 --> 1:35:22.786
I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you.

1:35:22.889 --> 1:35:24.857
I'm sorry I couldn't be Dash.

1:35:25.443 --> 1:35:26.721
You're right.

1:35:27.756 --> 1:35:29.309
You're nothing like Dash.

1:35:29.413 --> 1:35:32.450
You didn't ride in
on a white horse
to save me.

1:35:32.554 --> 1:35:37.939
You rode in on a...
borrowed scooter
with a broken muffler.

1:35:39.319 --> 1:35:40.735
Yeah.

1:35:40.838 --> 1:35:43.738
I never could've written
a Dash like you.

1:35:45.636 --> 1:35:47.569
'Cause I never knew

1:35:48.259 --> 1:35:50.054
a Dash like Alan.

1:35:50.158 --> 1:35:52.608
I was so afraid
of being hurt by life again

1:35:52.712 --> 1:35:54.093
that I just stopped living.

1:35:54.196 --> 1:35:56.198
Couldn't see the good things
in front of me.

1:35:56.302 --> 1:35:59.788
I'm just so sorry
I didn't see you sooner.

1:36:00.755 --> 1:36:02.480
I have a confession too.

1:36:02.584 --> 1:36:06.484
See, I was really liking
where this new story of ours
was headed.

1:36:06.588 --> 1:36:09.798
I just wanted to see how
it was gonna turn out, I guess.

1:36:11.110 --> 1:36:13.664
The Adventures
of Loretta and Alan.

1:36:15.770 --> 1:36:17.702
No, it would need
a better title than that.

1:36:17.806 --> 1:36:19.774
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.

1:36:20.913 --> 1:36:24.709
Sorry. Just...
Taha's femur is poking me.

1:36:28.403 --> 1:36:30.163
Rafi must have
left that.

1:36:30.267 --> 1:36:32.787
How do you forget your crowbar?
It's gonna help us escape.

1:36:32.890 --> 1:36:34.512
No, he left it
on purpose.

1:36:34.616 --> 1:36:36.307
Oh, cool. I always liked him.

1:36:36.411 --> 1:36:37.826
One...Okay.

1:36:37.930 --> 1:36:39.759
...two, three!Okay.

1:36:39.863 --> 1:36:43.798
I would've preferred him
to not leave us here
in the first place, but...

1:36:44.488 --> 1:36:45.316
Okay.

1:37:06.372 --> 1:37:08.581
Dulcius ex asperis.

1:37:12.930 --> 1:37:14.829
Sweeter after difficulty.

1:37:21.456 --> 1:37:22.906
Go up!
Run for the trees!

1:37:24.114 --> 1:37:27.013
Wait. Nope. Never mind.
Trees are on fire.

1:37:27.462 --> 1:37:29.153
Okay.

1:37:30.741 --> 1:37:32.605
We can go back
through the tunnel.

1:37:33.571 --> 1:37:34.849
Nope. Tunnel's a no-go.

1:37:39.957 --> 1:37:41.925
Um, okay.
I'm open to other ideas.

1:37:42.028 --> 1:37:45.583
There's a current.
We can follow it into the ocean.

1:37:45.687 --> 1:37:47.309
How do we know
what's on the other side?

1:37:47.827 --> 1:37:48.897
We don't.

1:37:50.726 --> 1:37:52.867
There's only one way
to find out.

1:37:54.420 --> 1:37:56.077
Worth the rash.Yeah?

1:38:17.063 --> 1:38:18.064
Alan?

1:38:26.521 --> 1:38:27.763
Alan!

1:39:05.215 --> 1:39:06.216
Alan?

1:39:06.319 --> 1:39:09.012
A-- Alan?

1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:11.221
Alan!

1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:16.226
Oh, my God! You're alive!

1:39:16.329 --> 1:39:18.573
I'm alive.Oh, my God.
I thought I killed you.

1:39:21.541 --> 1:39:22.508
Is that Beth?

1:39:22.611 --> 1:39:23.854
Loretta!

1:39:24.475 --> 1:39:25.649
Beth!

1:39:25.752 --> 1:39:27.409
Beth!

1:39:27.513 --> 1:39:28.755
Beth!

1:39:34.416 --> 1:39:35.797
Beth, you're here!

1:39:36.453 --> 1:39:37.661
Why are you here?

1:39:37.764 --> 1:39:40.560
I told you I got your back,
girl!

1:39:41.147 --> 1:39:42.942
I'm so sorry!

1:39:43.046 --> 1:39:45.151
I destroyed
the jumpsuit!

1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:46.601
What?

1:39:46.704 --> 1:39:49.224
Never mind! Later.

1:39:49.328 --> 1:39:51.330
I found a British guy
in a cave.

1:39:51.433 --> 1:39:53.918
I thought he was a little boy,
but he has a full beard.

1:39:54.022 --> 1:39:57.301
Beth, that's Fairfax!
He kidnapped us!

1:39:57.405 --> 1:40:00.166
He's a bad guy, Beth!
He killed my trainer!

1:40:00.270 --> 1:40:01.271
Get him!

1:40:01.788 --> 1:40:02.962
Stop him!

1:40:10.797 --> 1:40:13.007
I got your back, girl.

1:40:15.147 --> 1:40:17.114
Where were you running?
It's a boat.

1:40:17.218 --> 1:40:18.736
This guy's hilarious.

1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:20.566
Got you.

1:40:20.669 --> 1:40:21.946
Swim over to the rock!

1:40:22.050 --> 1:40:24.121
I don't got you.
No, I got you.I got you.

1:40:24.225 --> 1:40:26.123
We're gonna get you.
It's gonna be okay.

1:40:26.227 --> 1:40:28.815
"Finding refuge
on a nearby rock,

1:40:28.919 --> 1:40:31.025
he lifted her from the water,

1:40:31.128 --> 1:40:34.304
his powerful arms
pulling her body close.

1:40:34.407 --> 1:40:35.546
Alan whispered..."

1:40:35.650 --> 1:40:38.204
Shh. You're safe now.

1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:45.280
"In that moment,
Loretta could feel a new
adventure was just beginning."

1:40:46.557 --> 1:40:49.215
"The heart-pounding passion
of the narrow escape

1:40:49.319 --> 1:40:52.253
only inflamed Loretta's
desire for him.

1:40:52.356 --> 1:40:56.567
She was thirsty for the hot lava
soon to be pulsing from his..."

1:40:56.671 --> 1:41:00.261
Don't you go stopping
right at the good part.

1:41:01.607 --> 1:41:03.436
It's nothing she hasn't
read before.

1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:04.920
Didn't I tell you?

1:41:05.024 --> 1:41:08.027
The most beautiful beach
in the world.

1:41:08.131 --> 1:41:11.444
Maybe later, I'll show you
the Cove of Enchantment?

1:41:11.548 --> 1:41:13.136
No, you can take Randy.

1:41:13.239 --> 1:41:16.898
Remember, you are
my platonic man friend.

1:41:17.001 --> 1:41:20.039
Platonic?
I like the sound of that.

1:41:20.143 --> 1:41:22.800
Not sure what it means,
but I like the sound of it.

1:41:22.904 --> 1:41:25.113
Here you go, Randy.

1:41:26.873 --> 1:41:29.186
My dear.You are an angel.
Thank you.

1:41:29.842 --> 1:41:31.257
How did you know?

1:41:43.166 --> 1:41:45.961
Nice way to end
a book tour, right?Mm-hmm.

1:41:46.514 --> 1:41:48.343
Um...

1:41:48.447 --> 1:41:52.692
You know,
I have a phrase I like to use
in moments like these, actually.

1:41:52.796 --> 1:41:54.038
Um...

1:41:55.523 --> 1:41:56.938
Quid deinde?

1:41:58.077 --> 1:42:01.253
It's Latin.
It means, uh, "What's next?"

1:42:03.151 --> 1:42:04.670
Quid cogitas?

1:42:04.773 --> 1:42:06.154
Mmm.

1:42:06.879 --> 1:42:08.052
Buca di Beppo.

1:42:11.470 --> 1:42:13.127
Yeah. I know
zero other Latin.No. Yes.

1:42:13.230 --> 1:42:16.164
I looked it up
for this moment right now.

1:42:16.992 --> 1:42:19.133
So, what does come next?

1:42:19.236 --> 1:42:21.721
How would you write this?I don't know.

1:42:21.825 --> 1:42:24.379
How would you write it?Do we really want me
to write this?

1:42:24.483 --> 1:42:26.830
Just try. Take a stab at it.Okay. I'll write it.

1:42:26.933 --> 1:42:28.280
Okay.

1:42:28.383 --> 1:42:31.386
"We were-- They were, uh...
standing on a beach."

1:42:31.490 --> 1:42:33.423
Sets the stage for the audience.
They know where we are.

1:42:33.526 --> 1:42:35.321
You're already laughing.
Why are you laughing at me?

1:42:35.425 --> 1:42:37.220
I'm not laughing.
I'm smiling.You are.

1:42:37.323 --> 1:42:41.327

There is a dead jellyfish--"

1:42:46.884 --> 1:42:49.335
All you're doing
is describing what you're
actually seeing right now.

1:42:49.439 --> 1:42:52.269
"He's nervous
because he really likes her."

1:42:53.132 --> 1:42:55.169
It's nice writing.

1:42:55.272 --> 1:42:56.584
Thanks.You're welcome.

1:42:56.687 --> 1:42:57.792
I'll keep going.

1:42:57.895 --> 1:42:59.483
"He looked deep in her eyes.

The only thing
that could compare
to the pulse of that ocean

1:43:03.832 --> 1:43:04.902
was the throbbing in the--"

1:43:05.006 --> 1:43:08.112
Okay, no, you can't throb.Why not?

1:43:08.216 --> 1:43:09.942
Can't come
out of the gate
with a throb.

1:43:10.045 --> 1:43:12.358
You throb all the time.I don't come
out of the gate with it.

1:43:12.462 --> 1:43:14.360
You have to earn the throb.Who made you
the queen of throb?

1:43:14.464 --> 1:43:18.157
It's usually a chapter four
thing. You want it brought up
appropriately in four.

1:43:18.261 --> 1:43:20.366
I think you throb
in all the chapters.
"Pulsating."

1:43:20.470 --> 1:43:22.403
It's a precursor to throb.

1:43:22.506 --> 1:43:24.612
"Undulating."You just jumped to five.

1:43:24.715 --> 1:43:27.580
How 'bout they just kiss?
Why not?Just like a regular kiss?

1:43:27.684 --> 1:43:29.548
Yeah. Like a
beginning-of-the-chapter kiss.

1:43:29.651 --> 1:43:31.239
I'm good at starting--

1:43:35.105 --> 1:43:36.589
How was that? Any notes?

1:43:37.349 --> 1:43:40.731
Very good
first chapter attempt.
