00:04.760 --> 00:08.320
<i></i>

00:30.040 --> 00:32.240
Why aren't your brother and sister helping you?

00:32.280 --> 00:34.280
Don't worry, Papa, I got this covered.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.520
Your mother always used to scold me

00:34.320 --> 00:37.520
for spending so much on wine.

00:37.560 --> 00:41.000
"All tastes the same after a few glasses."

00:41.040 --> 00:43.360
Boy, she'd be mad at me for buying this lot.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.800
I think she would've just been happy to have

00:43.400 --> 00:45.800
everyone together again.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.320
See you at lunch, then?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.520
Have you seen your father?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.560
ANNA: No. TERRANCE: No.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.560
What do you think? It's my mother.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.160
-Swimming. -Hmm.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.880
She used to love doing laps in the pool.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.000
Blue is very nice.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.280
Ah, Mr Jackson,

01:14.320 --> 01:16.120
these are the faxes from the London office,

01:16.160 --> 01:18.640
-the documents you requested. -Thank you.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.840
Daddy? I've almost finished it.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.240
Well, do you like it?

01:24.280 --> 01:26.120
Are you happy with it?

01:26.160 --> 01:27.920
Yes. Yes. I think I am.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.440
Well, I'm happy if you are.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.080
-Under control.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.840
Market's looking pretty bullish at the moment.

01:39.880 --> 01:40.920
Mmm-hmm.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.920
There are some developments I need to discuss with you

01:54.840 --> 01:57.920
after lunch.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.520
Ah, Joseph, nice of you to make an effort.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.280
I didn't realise there was a dress code.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.960
I can lend you a decent shirt and tie if you want.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.920
Hmm, good idea, boys. Let's start bickering,

02:40.960 --> 02:42.520
today of all days.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.520
-Check where Daddy is, please.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.160
Some of us are getting hungry. Mr Jackson?

02:56.680 --> 02:58.160
Mr Jackson?

03:12.920 --> 03:14.040
Oh, my God!

03:50.040 --> 03:52.280
HUMPHREY: Let me review what we know so far.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.000
A man is found dead at the bottom

03:52.320 --> 03:55.000
of a 10-storey building,

03:55.040 --> 03:56.360
clearly having fallen.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.960
Yes.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.160
And the detective must work out whether it

03:58.000 --> 04:01.160
was murder or suicide.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.080
He goes up each floor and throws a coin

04:03.120 --> 04:04.480
out of the window at every level.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.040
And then he knows he's got his answer.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.800
-It doesn't matter.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.240
It was murder.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.040
Ah, yes. It's definitely murder.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.600
-The coins aren't important.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.640
-Maybe we should start again from the beginning...

04:15.640 --> 04:17.640
-Oh, gosh!

04:17.680 --> 04:20.760
-Honore Police Station.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.480
It must have been murder

04:22.520 --> 04:25.840
because the detective had to open up all the windows,

04:22.520 --> 04:25.840
which means

04:25.880 --> 04:28.880
the victim was pushed out and the window closed afterwards.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.560
If it was suicide, he would have found

04:28.920 --> 04:32.560
an open window. Simple.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.000
Well, it does depend on how big

04:32.600 --> 04:35.000
the window ledges are.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.320
I thought you said you liked riddles.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.920
I do. Give me... Give me another.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.880
Okay. There's been a murder on Sebastien Island.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.200
Okay.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.520
And?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.480
And we should go there.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.840
No. I don't get it.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.560
No, sir, it's not a riddle. There's actually

04:50.600 --> 04:52.600
been a murder. Alexander Jackson.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.600
-Been found shot near his home.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.080
-I'll arrange some transport. -What do you mean

04:55.640 --> 04:58.080
by carpetbagger?

04:58.120 --> 05:01.400
The man made millions out of property developments,

04:58.120 --> 05:01.400
land grabs.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.000
And he has a house on Sebastien Island?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.040
Chief! The man owns the whole island.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.920
There's only one house on it. His! He's a lucky man.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.480
Or should I say "was"?

05:10.520 --> 05:13.000
CAMILLE: We'll be at the harbour in 10 minutes.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.680
-It doesn't matter!

05:22.240 --> 05:24.200
I can't imagine buying an entire island.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.760
-Buying a house was stressful enough.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.760
-That's the rich for you.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.120
Considering Mr Jackson's popularity,

05:30.160 --> 05:32.760
living away from Saint Marie was

05:30.160 --> 05:32.760
probably a smart move.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.320
He wasn't well liked?

05:34.360 --> 05:36.720
Buying up land cheap, clearing out the locals,

05:36.760 --> 05:39.440
and building luxury homes in their place?

05:36.760 --> 05:39.440
What do you think?

05:39.480 --> 05:42.080
Some of those homes had been in families

05:39.480 --> 05:42.080
for generations.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.480
Yes, I imagine the drinks will be flowing in

05:44.520 --> 05:46.200
a fair few of the bars tonight.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.680
Owah.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.960
I mean, the estate agent fees alone would be astronomical.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.640
Oh, it's a little bit choppy.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.600
Yes, sir, the weather report says there might be storms.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.760
But don't worry. They're usually wrong.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.160
Coming up, whoa!

06:13.800 --> 06:15.200
Oh, oh...

06:16.440 --> 06:17.880
Thank you.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.600
-Hello. -Hello.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.240
I'm Emily Benoit. Mr Jackson's

06:24.640 --> 06:27.240
personal assistant.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.440
I'm DS Bordey, this is Inspector Goodman.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.760
You were the one who made the call?

06:31.200 --> 06:32.640
Yes.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.760
Er, the housemaid, Rosie, she, she found the body...

06:35.720 --> 06:37.040
Can you take us to it?

06:37.680 --> 06:38.960
Yes, of course.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.840
HUMPHREY: So who else is here at the moment?

06:42.880 --> 06:46.000
Mr Jackson's two sons and his daughter.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.840
It's been a year since his wife passed away.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.480
I'm sorry to hear that. How did she die?

06:50.520 --> 06:52.320
A stroke. It was very sudden.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.320
Mr Jackson wanted everyone in the family to join him here

06:52.360 --> 06:55.320
to remember her.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.400
Gathering the clan, as it were.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.160
And you are considered family?

07:00.600 --> 07:03.360
Me? No.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.120
He had some work things he wanted me to go over

07:03.400 --> 07:06.120
this weekend. Did he always work weekends?

07:08.920 --> 07:11.160
Mr Jackson liked to do things his own way.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.680
No internet, no mobile reception,

07:11.200 --> 07:14.680
only one landline.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.640
He doesn't even own a computer.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.600
He called this place his Fortress of Solitude.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.440
Yes, well, that's pretty apt.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.480
So, the jetty is the only way on or off this island?

07:24.520 --> 07:27.720
He made sure of that. Security was very important to him.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.000
I'm going to have my own island one day, you know.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.720
Hmm, sure, Dwayne. Of course you are.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.800
I'm Detective Inspector Goodman, this is DS Bordey.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.520
Terrance Jackson, this is my sister, Anna,

07:54.840 --> 07:57.520
and my brother, Joseph. I'll need you to step away

07:57.560 --> 08:00.240
from the body, you're contaminating the crime scene.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.760
Actually we were waiting for you. We want to move our

08:00.280 --> 08:03.760
father inside the house now.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.400
It's very important that you stay away from the body.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.920
Look, my father was a great man.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.840
It's disrespectful to leave him lying out like this.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.320
I sympathise but the sooner you let us get on

08:08.880 --> 08:11.320
with our jobs,

08:11.360 --> 08:13.480
the sooner we can move him somewhere more... Respectful.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.640
Maybe it's better we wait up at the house.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.920
Thank you.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.920
Best you go with them.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.000
Thank you.

08:34.880 --> 08:39.560
Sir. I've got a bullet here. Looks like it's gone

08:34.880 --> 08:39.560
straight through.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.120
And judging by the wound and the bullet,

08:41.160 --> 08:42.760
I'd say he was shot with a pistol.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.240
HUMPHREY: Why is he not wearing his shirt?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.680
Look at his clothes.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.360
Smartly dressed, bit odd, isn't it?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.800
Sat here and decides to take his shirt off?

08:53.840 --> 08:56.400
Look, I'm going to go and tell the captain to take

08:53.840 --> 08:56.400
the boat back,

08:56.440 --> 08:58.720
pick up the paramedics so the body can

08:56.440 --> 08:58.720
get examined properly.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.280
Okay, well, you better tell him to get a move on.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.000
DWAYNE: What? FIDEL: The storm.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.480
Well, you'd better finish up here and take the body

09:02.040 --> 09:05.480
inside then.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.400
So, it's a year since his wife passed away.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.520
Family all together, on the island he owns.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.880
At some point he comes outside, removes his shirt.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.720
And is shot through the heart with a pistol.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.800
I think it's time we heard what the family have to say

09:14.760 --> 09:17.800
for themselves.

09:34.800 --> 09:39.120
Erm, as difficult as this must be for all of you, we need

09:39.160 --> 09:42.960
to know the last time you all saw Mr Jackson

09:39.160 --> 09:42.960
prior to his death.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.680
Well, I saw him at the jetty

09:44.720 --> 09:47.000
when the boat delivered supplies for lunch.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.760
ANNA: <i> I saw him when I</i> <i>was painting by the pool.</i>

09:50.800 --> 09:52.200
TERRANCE: <i> I saw him there too.</i>

09:54.800 --> 09:57.120
Ah... Erm...

09:57.160 --> 09:59.320
I've broken my pencil. Have you got a pen?

09:59.360 --> 10:02.400
I have a pen. Be careful. It's very expensive.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.040
Thank you.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.920
So, jetty, swimming pool.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.240
And that was the last time he was seen?

10:13.280 --> 10:16.560
No. I saw him later in his study.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.480
He was just putting something in the safe.

10:18.520 --> 10:22.640
Then headed out for a walk. It was around 11:20 or so.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.640
What was he putting in the safe?

10:24.680 --> 10:26.880
Not sure. Financial projections, maybe?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.480
And how did he seem

10:29.520 --> 10:31.480
He did seem a little preoccupied.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.960
There are some developments I need to discuss

10:31.520 --> 10:34.960
with you after lunch.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.640
Sir, it's not my place

10:36.680 --> 10:39.840
but maybe you shouldn't be worrying about business today.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.560
This is something that needs to be done.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.640
At this point, before he

10:44.680 --> 10:46.760
went for his walk, did he have his shirt on?

10:46.800 --> 10:48.280
Yes. Of course.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.920
Did he say why he was going out to the garden?

10:49.960 --> 10:53.040
Father always liked to take a walk before lunch.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.440
Clear his head from business.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.320
Except at some point within the hour, bang!

10:57.120 --> 10:58.280
A gun goes off.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.280
Yes. I heard it.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.000
<i>I was preparing</i> <i>the vegetables for lunch</i>

11:03.040 --> 11:05.760
<i>and I had another 30 minutes</i> <i>before it was due to be ready.</i>

11:05.800 --> 11:08.400
<i>That must have</i> <i>been about 11:40.</i>

11:11.800 --> 11:14.760
I thought it was just Mr Jackson

11:11.800 --> 11:14.760
shooting the birds again.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.840
-Mmm-hmm.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.160
It's a business thing.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.160
Take the client out to play golf or go shooting.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.080
Father liked to keep his aim in, you know?

11:24.120 --> 11:27.000
Was the gun kept for protection, as well?

11:27.040 --> 11:30.040
He wasn't exactly popular with certain people in Saint Marie.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.240
Everything he did was legal.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.760
Which doesn't make it morally right.

11:35.800 --> 11:40.080
Ask the hundreds of people made homeless by

11:35.800 --> 11:40.080
papa's little loopholes.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.800
HUMPHREY: Let's return to the gun in a moment.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.480
I want to be clear where everyone was

11:43.520 --> 11:45.840
when the shot was heard at 11:40.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.280
I was by the pool, working on my painting.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.800
I heard the shot.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.160
I assumed the same thing as Rosie, that it was the birds.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.960
I heard it too. I was in the library

11:52.200 --> 11:55.960
doing some reading.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.880
I was in my room taking a shower,

11:56.000 --> 12:01.880
getting ready for lunch.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.000
Which leaves you, Joseph. Did you hear the gunshot?

12:05.040 --> 12:08.040
No. I was running, I had my headphones on.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.320
Normally I have a workout on the beach when I stay here.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.000
But the weather looked like it was turning,

12:12.040 --> 12:14.280
so I decided just to head to the gym instead.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.000
Right, so...

12:17.760 --> 12:19.640
Kitchen. Pool.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.040
Library. Room.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.720
Gym.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.840
All of you alone.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.640
No corroboration as to where you were.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.400
Um, no. Rosie saw me.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.760
-Yes.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.280
I was asking her. Not you.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.440
Er, yes, I saw him in the gym.

12:35.480 --> 12:36.800
What time was that?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.480
ROSIE: <i> Er, maybe around</i> <i>half past 11:00</i>

12:39.520 --> 12:42.880
<i>all the way through</i> <i>to 11:50, 12:00.</i>

12:42.920 --> 12:45.640


12:42.920 --> 12:45.640
<i>-Well, I was...</i>

12:45.680 --> 12:47.600
<i>I was busy running in</i> <i>and out the kitchen,</i>

12:47.640 --> 12:50.680
<i>but I'm fairly sure I would</i> <i>have noticed if he'd gone</i>

12:47.640 --> 12:50.680
<i>anywhere else.</i>

12:52.520 --> 12:54.920
Fairly sure.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.800
Joseph has an alibi but no one else has someone

12:54.960 --> 12:57.800
who can vouch

12:57.840 --> 12:59.560
for where they were.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.240
About this gun your father owned...

13:01.280 --> 13:04.200
It's a shotgun. It's kept mounted in the hallway.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.880
And it's the only gun in the house?

13:10.440 --> 13:11.840
Is there something we should know?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.720
It's, erm...

13:15.760 --> 13:18.400
It's not the only gun.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.280
<i>Yesterday afternoon,</i> <i>I was out looking</i>

13:18.440 --> 13:21.280
<i>for inspiration</i>

13:21.320 --> 13:22.960
<i>and I heard the shots.</i>

13:31.040 --> 13:33.280
It was just practice.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.840
I mean, I have a pistol, yes, but it's for

13:33.320 --> 13:36.840
personal protection.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.480
In a lockbox in my room. It's quite safe.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.440
I keep the key on me at all times.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.280
Even when working out in the gym?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.440
At all times.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.000
But if papa was killed by a shotgun...

13:51.040 --> 13:53.320
Well, that's the thing, you see, he wasn't.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.120
We believe the weapon used was a pistol.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.440
I'm not a fan of guns

14:04.480 --> 14:08.720
but I work for an aid organisation around the world.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.600
Sadly, some of the places that need the most help are also

14:11.640 --> 14:13.720
the most dangerous.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.320
And the organisation you work for condones

14:13.760 --> 14:17.320
the carrying of firearms?

14:17.360 --> 14:20.600
Yes, well, they... They understand.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.920
Aid work's a little bit different from

14:20.640 --> 14:22.920
what your father did.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.560
That's kind of the point.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.960
How long have you been back here?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.440
Only a few days. It's been a long time

14:27.000 --> 14:30.440
since I've been home.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.120
And why is that?

14:32.160 --> 14:35.240
Had some pretty big issues with how Papa

14:32.160 --> 14:35.240
made his millions.

14:35.280 --> 14:39.440
Seemed better to stay away than have endless arguments

14:35.280 --> 14:39.440
about it.

14:39.480 --> 14:43.160
But after Mum died, felt it was time to build

14:39.480 --> 14:43.160
those bridges again, you know?

14:45.840 --> 14:49.040
Trust me, you won't find a better lock.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.320
And you're the only one with a key with access to it?

14:51.360 --> 14:54.240
Well, yes, but Rosie saw me in the gym.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.600
And violence is never an answer to anything.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.600
I'm a pacifist.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.120
A pacifist with a pistol.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.680
Here it is.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.880
Right, so I'll need to lock this away, okay?

15:07.920 --> 15:10.320
You sure that's not the murder weapon?

15:10.360 --> 15:13.160
Your father was killed with a pistol bullet.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.840
Shotguns don't fire bullets. They fire shot.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.360
Well, you seem to know your stuff.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.240
If there's anything else you need...

15:21.280 --> 15:23.480
Yes, just be around to answer any more

15:21.280 --> 15:23.480
follow Chief, I hope you know that

15:43.160 --> 15:45.360
that storm means

15:45.400 --> 15:47.160
the crime scene's a goner, you know.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.560
That wind is going to cut right through it

15:47.200 --> 15:49.560
and tear it up.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.880
Sounds like orange to me.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.080
Er?

15:52.120 --> 15:53.640
Storms are colour coded, sir.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.840
Orange means stay inside, lock the doors

15:55.880 --> 15:58.840
and all boats remain in the harbour.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.040
Wait! So that means the paramedics

15:58.880 --> 16:01.040
can't come over?

16:01.080 --> 16:02.160
I'm afraid so.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.400
So, we're stranded here?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.640
Yes, and that means the killer is too.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.200
Yes, well, that's reassuring.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.400
Yeah, not to mention without mobile

16:07.240 --> 16:09.400
or internet connections

16:09.440 --> 16:11.000
we can't even get proper background checks.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.160
We can improvise. Get what information we can from here.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.840
And at least we still have an outside line.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.880
With a distinct lack of a dialling tone.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.600
Phone lines tend to be the first thing to go.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.960
Okay!

16:28.000 --> 16:31.160
So, let's make this the base of our operations

16:28.000 --> 16:31.160
for the time being.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.760
So what do we need? Right, we need headshots.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.720
A-ha! Present on the island

16:35.760 --> 16:37.680
at the time of the murder

16:37.720 --> 16:40.840
we have Anna the daughter, Terrance the son.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.000
DWAYNE: She's 30, a freelance artist

16:40.880 --> 16:44.000
in New York.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.720
Terrance has always lived at home.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.720
He's 37 years old,

16:46.760 --> 16:49.720
and he's the vice-president of his father's

16:46.760 --> 16:49.720
property company.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.520
Then we have Emily the PA.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.360
Hard working and willing to work

16:51.560 --> 16:54.360
overtime at weekends.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.520
-Just like us. -Speak for yourself.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.000
DWAYNE: Now, Emily's 42.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.200
She's worked for Alexander for 11 months.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.280
Then we have Rosie the maid who found the body.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.480
Now there are no photos of her.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.400
So, we need to improvise.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.280
Going to need some paper.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.320
-Sir. -Thank you. Okay...

17:16.720 --> 17:18.160
There we go.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.040
Oh, you have hidden talents, sir!

17:22.240 --> 17:23.560
So, what have we got on her?

17:23.600 --> 17:25.480
Twenty-five. Been with the family

17:23.600 --> 17:25.480
three years.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.280
And finally we have Joseph.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.040
Forty. Works for foreign aid.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.840
Tends to live wherever his work takes him.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.680
Yes, and let's not forget he arrived at

17:32.880 --> 17:35.680
his mother's memorial

17:35.720 --> 17:37.480
with a pistol in tow.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.200
And then his father was found dead.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.200
Shirt off. Shot.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.400
Two pieces of the puzzle right there. Why was he shirtless?

17:44.440 --> 17:47.040
And why use a gun? A small island.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.720
Much quieter ways to kill someone.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.360
Strangling.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.640
Poison. Push him off a cliff.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.920
Half brick to the back of the head.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.080
Yes, erm...

17:58.120 --> 18:01.160
Nevertheless, the bullet that killed Alexander did

17:58.120 --> 18:01.160
come from a pistol.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.080
And as far as we know the only pistol on the island

18:01.200 --> 18:04.080
belongs to Joseph.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.400
-Unless someone is lying to us.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.400
-Which is entirely possible.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.520
So we need to find out if the bullet came from

18:07.440 --> 18:10.520
the pistol that Joseph owns.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.960
I could check the striation marks

18:10.560 --> 18:12.960
from the recovered bullet

18:13.000 --> 18:14.480
with another one fired from the gun.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.320
-Mmm-hmm. -If they match up,

18:14.520 --> 18:16.320
then we'd know for sure that

18:16.360 --> 18:18.360
-the pistol was the murder weapon.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.360
-Good.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.600
Well, it looks like we're going to have to use

18:19.640 --> 18:21.240
the old-fashioned ways to solve this case.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.040
And the sooner we do so, the better.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.760
Because one of the five people in this house killed

18:23.080 --> 18:26.760
Alexander Jackson.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.640
So, let's be wary of that.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.200
Watch your backs... And each other's.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.520
I've always wanted to say that!

18:36.280 --> 18:40.920
So, who stood to gain the most from

18:36.280 --> 18:40.920
Alexander's death?

18:40.960 --> 18:45.240
Well, on the surface, Terrance seems the obvious choice.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.000
Vice-president of his father's firm.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.000
And now Daddy's gone, he's just gained control

18:47.040 --> 18:50.000
of a large,

18:50.040 --> 18:51.400
successful company.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.360
I'm the only one who's qualified to do it.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.720
Really?

18:59.360 --> 19:00.840
Not Anna

19:00.880 --> 19:02.880
Joseph?

19:02.920 --> 19:05.760
The only time Joseph's got involved in the company is

19:02.920 --> 19:05.760
across the bloody picket line.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.040
The picket line being?

19:09.640 --> 19:12.800
Joseph protested against some of father's resort plans.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.920
Father almost had him thrown in jail.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.600
Do you have the combination for the safe?

19:17.640 --> 19:20.040
No. But Emily does.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.080
Says here that your father only had one

19:22.120 --> 19:25.440
appointment for next week, with his solicitor on Monday.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.000
Do you have any idea what that was about?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.960
No. But I think maybe that...

19:29.000 --> 19:30.120
Emily would know.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.280
Yes. Sorry.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.320
I didn't spend much time in father's study.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.000
I guess it's my study now.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.920
I always expected him to hand the keys over to me.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.320
Father to son. But...

19:48.240 --> 19:50.600
Never imagined it would be like this.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.880
Take this. Oh!

20:20.280 --> 20:22.000
Here! Come on.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.720
These are all of Alexander's files

20:25.280 --> 20:28.720
that were in storage.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.760
Excellent. Thank you. And the safe?

20:32.040 --> 20:34.400
The combination is his wedding anniversary.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.560
Thank you.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.880
CAMILLE: He had an appointment with his solicitor on Monday.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.240
Do you know what that was about?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.120
No. He didn't mention it.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.280
Sorry.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.440
Right, well, none of these seem particularly recent.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.600
Financial projections for this year and last.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.840
Not sure what that is...

21:07.280 --> 21:09.680
Oh! And his last will and testament.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.240
I don't suppose he left this island to the longest-serving

21:12.280 --> 21:15.040
officer of the Honore Police Station,

21:12.280 --> 21:15.040
by any chance, did he?

21:15.080 --> 21:16.800
Actually, he did.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.200
Congratulations, Dwayne, all this is yours.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.840
-No... -No! Of course not.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.080
It's your standard three-way split between the children.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.400
All included. All equally divided.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.200
DWAYNE: <i> Sometimes Your Words</i> <i>Hurt Me Like a Dagger</i>

21:27.440 --> 21:30.200
<i>Through My Heart.</i>

21:30.240 --> 21:31.440
It was just a joke, Dwayne.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.560
No, Chief,

21:33.600 --> 21:35.720
it was among Alexander's things.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.720
It's the name of a play Anna wrote a few years back.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.200
Had an off-Broadway performance in New York.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.280
So, an artist and a writer.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.560
There's another one here as well.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.280
One from a fashion show she organised nine months ago

21:49.320 --> 21:51.040
<i>The Empress's New Clothes.</i>

21:51.080 --> 21:53.600
And a message on the back to him

21:53.640 --> 21:55.720
saying she knows he's missed all her other events

21:55.760 --> 21:57.720
but hoping he would make this one.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.200
"Really hoping."

22:00.240 --> 22:02.560
Yeah, which he didn't. Contractors' meeting instead.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.720
I thought you were meant to go to your kids' plays and stuff.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.760
It's like a legal obligation of being a father.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.320
If you're interested in them, yes.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.320
I wonder if Alexander was.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.280
Never showing up despite the fact

22:10.360 --> 22:13.280
she kept inviting him.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.520
You think he disapproved?

22:14.560 --> 22:18.000
Could be. Maybe saw her as flighty.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.600
I think it's time to see what the artist has to say

22:18.040 --> 22:21.600
for herself.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.840
Perhaps we would be better off inside.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.400
Shh. Listen!

22:31.440 --> 22:33.240
What exactly are we listening for?

22:33.280 --> 22:38.280
I forget how violent these storms can be,

22:33.280 --> 22:38.280
that primal force of nature!

22:38.320 --> 22:41.880
If I could capture just some of that in

22:38.320 --> 22:41.880
one of my paintings...

22:41.920 --> 22:44.640
Please come back inside. Come on.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.400
Yeah.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.520
So, have you always wanted to be a painter?

22:53.560 --> 22:57.120
Oh, yes. It's my greatest dream.

22:57.160 --> 23:01.120
Right, not maybe a, a playwright or

22:57.160 --> 23:01.120
a fashion designer?

23:01.160 --> 23:05.480
Well, I have turned my hand to quite a few things,

23:05.520 --> 23:09.000
but when the muse calls, one has to follow.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.160
Have you ever had a regular job?

23:14.200 --> 23:16.160
Being a painter isn't a regular job?

23:17.040 --> 23:18.400
You know what I mean.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.680
Did your father see your career choices

23:18.440 --> 23:21.680
in the same way?

23:21.720 --> 23:25.480
Oh, he was always very supportive of me.

23:25.520 --> 23:30.440
So, if you had, say, a gallery opening

23:25.520 --> 23:30.440
he'd fly over especially?

23:30.480 --> 23:32.440
I'm sure that he would have tried to.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.280
Except he never managed to, did he? Which must've been

23:32.480 --> 23:36.280
very frustrating.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.920
Hurtful, even.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.320
To be on a stage, or by a catwalk,

23:37.960 --> 23:41.320
looking out into the crowd,

23:41.360 --> 23:45.160
hoping to see his face, yet knowing in your

23:41.360 --> 23:45.160
heart of hearts you won't.

23:48.120 --> 23:51.200
Perhaps what you said was right.

23:51.240 --> 23:55.480
He was always very business-minded.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.040
When I wanted to pursue the arts, my dreams,

23:58.080 --> 24:00.600
rather than join the family firm.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.040
Five minutes. That's all I ever wanted.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.160
Five minutes for him to sit and read something I'd written

24:07.200 --> 24:10.760
or look at a painting I'd done.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.760
I mean, really look.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.680
Not just glance and dismiss it.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.960
Not just glance and dismiss me.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.520
Look. Did I have issues with my father?

24:26.800 --> 24:29.720
Yes. Yes, I did. But I didn't kill him.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.040
I mean, I have issues with everyone, my brothers,

24:29.760 --> 24:33.040
my mother.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.840
If we carry on talking I'll probably have issues

24:33.080 --> 24:35.840
with you two.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.920
But it's okay. I'm in therapy for it.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.360
FIDEL: Bullet used to kill Alexander.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.240
Bullet from Joseph's gun.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.560
Let's see if you match up.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.560
Snap!

25:07.560 --> 25:09.240
Striation marks match.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.680
The bullet used to kill Alexander was fired

25:09.280 --> 25:11.680
from Joseph's pistol.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.560
Oh, how unfortunate.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.280
No, I'm sorry I mean, good work, Fidel.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.800
But it just makes things so much more complicated.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.600
We have Joseph, with a gun, in a locked box.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.120
A gun only he had access to.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.400
And yet he's the only person with an alibi for the murder.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.400
We need to find out if anyone else has their

25:25.440 --> 25:28.400
fingerprints on that gun.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.320
-I'll get on that right away. -I'll come with you.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.280
And we start in on Joseph's alibi.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.600
Because there is something missing from this puzzle.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.960
The gun locked away.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.320
A single key. Alexander's shirt removed.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.120
Why would a man dressed for lunch remove his shirt?

25:42.160 --> 25:45.160
Solve one of these clues and the whole thing

25:42.160 --> 25:45.160
should unravel.

25:45.800 --> 25:46.920
Hopefully.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.320
I still can't believe you forgot to pack

25:58.360 --> 26:00.040
my finger-printing equipment.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.120
Okay, I'm sorry but I did tell you it was for

26:00.080 --> 26:02.120
a magic trick

26:02.160 --> 26:04.160
I was working on.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.360
-To impress women, of course.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.200
Of course.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.640
Why go up to them and ask their names when

26:08.240 --> 26:10.640
you can just do this.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.120
Huh?

26:13.160 --> 26:14.560
This is why I hate lending you things.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.920
Ah, Rosie!

26:16.960 --> 26:18.560
I brought the items you asked for.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.080
A brush and cocoa powder.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.440
Good idea. Nice hot cup of cocoa.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.760
Calm him down a bit.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.560
No, Dwayne. It's for the fingerprints.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.760
What?

26:28.240 --> 26:29.240
One...

26:42.040 --> 26:43.360
Now, that's magic.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.640
He's very good.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.160
Yes, but I'm not too bad either.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.120
For example,

26:55.160 --> 26:56.480
I noticed your lovely earrings earlier.

26:59.040 --> 27:02.080
-No, no, no, imitation.

27:02.120 --> 27:06.640
First year on the force, I trailed a diamond forger

27:02.120 --> 27:06.640
for months.

27:06.680 --> 27:10.360
I can spot a fake diamond from 20 yards.

27:10.400 --> 27:13.480
So, I have to ask myself, "What is a housemaid

27:10.400 --> 27:13.480
doing with

27:13.520 --> 27:15.200
"shiny stones like these?"

27:15.240 --> 27:16.400
Hmm?

27:16.440 --> 27:17.680
They were a gift.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.480
From Mr Jackson.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.120
Quite an extravagant gift.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.200
You want to talk somewhere more private?

27:28.840 --> 27:30.120
Because I'm all ears.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.680
Right. Erm... Hmm...

27:46.720 --> 27:50.600
Well, I could definitely see you, but not your face,

27:46.720 --> 27:50.600
just your back.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.800
So if it was someone else on the treadmill,

27:52.840 --> 27:55.040
they would have had to look a lot like Joseph.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.680
A fake alibi then? Er, Rosie and Joseph working together.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.520
But what motive would Rosie have?

28:00.560 --> 28:04.400
She wouldn't have one. Not to kill Mr Jackson.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.120
In fact, he very kindly gave her some diamond earrings.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.440
What? Whoa!

28:12.480 --> 28:14.800
Well, that was very generous of him.

28:14.840 --> 28:19.040
It wasn't generosity. It was to buy her silence,

28:14.840 --> 28:19.040
her loyalty.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.480
You see, there was a little incident here,

28:20.520 --> 28:22.400
six months ago, one which would have been

28:22.440 --> 28:24.880
very embarrassing for the company if it had

28:22.440 --> 28:24.880
come out in the press.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.800
Rosie!

28:30.440 --> 28:33.560
One day all of this will be mine.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.280
Rosie! Rosie...

28:35.320 --> 28:37.440
-Mr Jackson... -Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

28:37.480 --> 28:38.880
Mr Jackson...

28:44.720 --> 28:48.480
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Rosie, please don't

28:44.720 --> 28:48.480
tell my father.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.040
I was drunk.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.520
It was a mistake.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.560
A stupid, foolish mistake and I've paid for it.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.720
He stopped my wages. My expense account.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.720
It was under review.

29:02.760 --> 29:05.520
Father said if I made another mistake he'd bump me

29:05.560 --> 29:07.800
right down to the same level as the doorman.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.600
While I can't condone your actions towards Rosie

29:10.640 --> 29:13.320
but that punishment sounds pretty humiliating for you.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.560
He didn't even tell me face-to-face.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.880
Just sent me a memo.

29:18.920 --> 29:19.920
That's his way.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.600
Yes, I

29:22.640 --> 29:23.680
know how you feel.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.480
I doubt it.

29:28.960 --> 29:32.600
I've got two brothers who graduated from Oxford.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.240
My father framed and put their certificates up in

29:32.640 --> 29:35.240
the living room.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.040
When I passed my police exams,

29:39.080 --> 29:41.880
I gave him a copy of that certificate,

29:41.920 --> 29:44.320
which he lovingly stuck up in the toilet.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.440
It was the way he was so dismissive of me, you know?

29:48.480 --> 29:51.920
Mmm. It's like they don't seem to appreciate

29:48.480 --> 29:51.920
all your hard work and effort.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.320
Maybe you just wanted to show him a bit of backbone.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.600
Maybe you just went a bit too far.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.440
What?

30:04.360 --> 30:06.760
No, no! He's my father!

30:06.800 --> 30:08.760
-I couldn't do that. -But he stopped your money.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.800
The one thing that made you feel like a success.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.760
No.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.680
I've always, always been loyal to my father.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.040
No matter what. We had a strong relationship.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.880
I mean...

30:19.920 --> 30:21.360
I mean, it wasn't like him and Joseph.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.280
We didn't have those kinds of problems, you know?

30:23.320 --> 30:26.760
Presumably their problems are in the past.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.760
The protests and so on.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.840
Well, you'd think so.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.680
I did. But maybe I was wrong.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.280
Last night, I heard them arguing.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.800
You hold your tongue. Don't you dare

30:34.320 --> 30:37.800
cross the line this time!

30:39.120 --> 30:41.600
HUMPHREY: <i> What were they</i> <i>arguing about?</i>

30:41.640 --> 30:44.560
I don't know. But ever since father's

30:41.640 --> 30:44.560
body was found,

30:44.600 --> 30:47.440
I've thought about it and turned it around

30:44.600 --> 30:47.440
in my head and...

30:51.000 --> 30:54.440
I'm loyal to my family. Above all.

30:54.480 --> 30:58.200
And I just hope with all my heart,

30:54.480 --> 30:58.200
Joseph feels the same way.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.600
HUMPHREY: I feel a bit sorry for Terrance.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.760
You shouldn't. He just inherited

31:02.640 --> 31:05.760
a multimillion pound company.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.680
Mmm.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.680
There's just something a little sad about the way

31:07.720 --> 31:09.680
he carries himself.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.160
Joseph on the other hand...

31:13.200 --> 31:16.400
Joseph? Confident. Willing to stand

31:13.200 --> 31:16.400
up to his father.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.160
On the night before Alexander died.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.440
Brings a pistol to the island.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.280
The pistol we know is the murder weapon.

31:21.320 --> 31:25.720
And yet it's locked away, he has the only key

31:21.320 --> 31:25.720
and the only alibi.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.560
We could search his room. See if we can

31:25.760 --> 31:28.560
uncover anything else.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.680
-It's not a bad idea, Camille.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.680
-Thank you.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.520
Okay. We've finished going through all these files.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.000
Are there any more?

31:40.120 --> 31:41.520
Absolutely.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.960
Can you just press your fingers down here, please?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.360
It's just that all the newspaper

31:44.000 --> 31:46.360
correspondence paints

31:46.400 --> 31:49.240
a pretty glowing picture of Alexander and his company.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.120
Well, he worked hard to get good press.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.120
And I remember the protests, the petitions, the trouble,

31:56.160 --> 31:57.760
-there must be more. -Mmm-hmm.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.960
Honestly, that's all we've got here.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.720
How do you know when someone's lying to you?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.080
They use the word "honestly" to start a sentence.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.840
Exactly.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.440
Maybe I'll snoop around a bit and see

32:14.480 --> 32:16.560
-if there's anything else I can dig up.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.560
-Sure.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.280
A-ha.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.480
I think I know what Joseph was so angry about.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.640
Looks like Alexander Jackson was planning on opening

32:38.680 --> 32:41.280
a new golf course on Saint Marie.

32:41.320 --> 32:44.160
Which would have meant having to move a lot

32:41.320 --> 32:44.160
of houses, families.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.680
Seeing as Joseph had already protested

32:45.720 --> 32:47.680
against his developments before...

32:47.720 --> 32:49.760
But would it be enough to kill his father over?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.960
I don't know. Let's keep looking.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.640
Gotcha.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.000
-Mmm-hmm.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.440
Catch.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.240
Not funny.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.120
And be careful.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.440
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

33:51.560 --> 33:52.680
It was just a power cut, right?

33:54.080 --> 33:56.360
I hope so. Otherwise...

33:56.400 --> 33:57.600
Somebody's done it on purpose.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.880
Don't worry, it happens a lot out here.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.560
Why does that not surprise me?

34:04.600 --> 34:06.520
Might be morning before the power comes back on.

34:06.560 --> 34:07.960
But we've got some more of these camper lights

34:08.000 --> 34:09.760
stored away for emergencies.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.960
-See, this is why I could never actually leave New York.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.720
Joseph. We'd like a word with you.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.960
I think it's time you were honest with us, Joseph.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.920
We've checked everyone's fingerprints against those

34:29.000 --> 34:31.920
found on your pistol.

34:33.520 --> 34:38.760
The very same pistol we know was used to kill your father.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.920
There is only one set of fingerprints.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.720
Yours.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.160
You were heard arguing with your father the night before

34:42.760 --> 34:45.160
he was killed.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.280
We found the documents in your room.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.280
About the new golf course.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.600
Maybe you didn't come back to build bridges after all.

34:50.640 --> 34:53.280
It was a big deal.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.400
The environmental damage alone would have

34:53.320 --> 34:56.400
been catastrophic.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.960
The last time you protested against one of

34:56.440 --> 34:58.960
your father's property plans,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.720
he had you arrested.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.640
I imagine this time you were even more determined

35:00.760 --> 35:02.640
not to back down. Yeah, I wasn't

35:02.680 --> 35:04.560
going to hold back.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.320
But he told me not to worry.

35:06.360 --> 35:09.400
That he had decided not to go ahead with it.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.560
He said that he'd been thinking a lot since Mum died.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.320
That he needed to make changes to his life. Big changes

35:15.360 --> 35:16.600
that would affect us all.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.280
-I don't know.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.720
He just told me that he knew I would be all right.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.640
And that he was proud of me.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.960
Although maybe less proud if he knew about you

35:23.680 --> 35:26.960
carrying that gun.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.960
I told you. It's a dangerous job.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.120
And I also happen to know that foreign aid workers

35:29.000 --> 35:32.120
don't carry firearms.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.120
-It's not relevant! Your father was shot

35:35.160 --> 35:38.120
by your own pistol. It's incredibly relevant.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.440
All right...

35:43.480 --> 35:46.760
I got arrested in Darfur at a checkpoint.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.720
Drug possession.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.520
Plea bargained my way out of jail by giving up

35:48.760 --> 35:51.520
the names of the dealers.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.880
They weren't happy. At all.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.680
I told you I wasn't lying

35:55.720 --> 35:57.960
when I said the pistol was for my protection.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.720
No, you weren't lying. But you weren't exactly

35:59.760 --> 36:01.880
telling the truth, were you?

36:11.200 --> 36:15.000
So, if Joseph is our killer, why use his own gun?

36:15.040 --> 36:17.120
Maybe it wasn't premeditated?

36:17.160 --> 36:19.120
Argument got out of control?

36:19.160 --> 36:21.320
Had his gun to use as a threat?

36:19.160 --> 36:21.320
That sort of thing?

36:21.360 --> 36:24.120
Okay, so Joseph follows Alexander out into

36:21.360 --> 36:24.120
the gardens.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.480
At some point Alexander removes his shirt, willingly,

36:26.520 --> 36:29.000
unwillingly, an argument escalates, Alexander is shot.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.920
Joseph returns to the house. Puts the gun in the lockbox?

36:31.960 --> 36:34.200
And hopes the police don't discover it?

36:31.960 --> 36:34.200
No, I don't buy it.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.640
Even in a panic he seems smarter than that.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.320
Plus, Rosie the housemaid saw Joseph in the gym

36:39.360 --> 36:40.520
at the time of the shooting.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.200
Which just brings us back to the question,

36:42.240 --> 36:45.040
how did he manage to kill his father

36:42.240 --> 36:45.040
without breaking his alibi?

36:46.840 --> 36:49.920
If it wasn't him, who else are we looking at?

36:49.960 --> 36:54.240
Rosie Father dies,

36:49.960 --> 36:54.240
he gets the company.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.760
Or Anna.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.200
Her father funded her lifestyle choices.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.640
But he never bothered to follow up, not in person.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.640
Fashion shows.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.040
Plays. He was absent.

37:03.080 --> 37:05.880
Maybe she snapped. Wanted the attention

37:03.080 --> 37:05.880
that badly.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.800
Then how did she or Terrance get hold of

37:05.920 --> 37:08.800
that damn pistol?

37:10.160 --> 37:13.280
-I don't know. -I don't know either.

37:13.320 --> 37:15.600
Here's the news, chief. I think you're going

37:13.320 --> 37:15.600
to like this.

37:15.640 --> 37:18.440
Now, I asked Emily for the other files and articles.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.160
But I could tell she wasn't being straight

37:20.200 --> 37:22.720
so I decided to have a look around for myself.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.920
That's when I discovered these.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.080
A couple of years ago, Alexander's company was

37:24.960 --> 37:28.080
buying up land

37:28.120 --> 37:30.200
cheaply and knocking down low-rent residences

37:30.240 --> 37:33.160
and businesses looking to build a luxury

37:30.240 --> 37:33.160
holiday resort.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.240
-Which people started protesting against...

37:33.200 --> 37:36.240
-Oh, yes.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.280
We've got a quote here from one of the protesters,

37:38.320 --> 37:39.640
a Ms Valerie Pellow.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.880
That's her there, Chief.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.920
That's Emily. Alexander's PA.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.600
Exactly. There is no Emily Benoit.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.400
She's Valerie Pellow.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.160
And her father lost his business due to

37:50.440 --> 37:53.160
Alexander Jackson.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.480
Please, take a seat.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.640
-Thank you. -Valerie.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.000
So, you know we've found out about you.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.760
Your real name. Your past.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.520
My father had a boat-hire business.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.080
Alexander crushed it.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.840
The anger and stress of it killed my father.

38:23.880 --> 38:27.560
So, you decided to work for Mr Jackson,

38:23.880 --> 38:27.560
under an assumed name.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.000
Looking for a way to get back at him?

38:29.040 --> 38:31.160
HUMPHREY: And maybe you were successful.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.760
I started working for him just after his wife died

38:33.800 --> 38:36.640
and he wasn't the man I thought he was going to be.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.720
He was...

38:39.640 --> 38:40.760
I don't know.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.680
Broken, I guess.

38:44.160 --> 38:45.800
In what way?

38:45.840 --> 38:48.320
By his wife's passing.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.880
By how he reached out to his children and how

38:48.360 --> 38:52.880
they barely cared.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.360
So he was angry with them?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.240
More like disgusted.

38:57.280 --> 39:00.800
He realised how alone he really was.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.520
But he still took your father's business

39:00.840 --> 39:02.520
away from him.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.920
-Indirectly caused his death. -That's true.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.560
I don't think I forgive Mr Jackson.

39:08.600 --> 39:12.080
But it was like he'd been punished enough.

39:12.120 --> 39:15.000
HUMPHREY: That's incredibly understanding of you.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.800
So much so I'm not sure I actually believe it.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.760
If you couldn't forgive him, why did you continue

39:17.840 --> 39:20.760
to work for him?

39:23.720 --> 39:24.800
The money is good.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.800
If you're loyal to him, you're paid well.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.560
Revenge doesn't pay the bills.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.360
HUMPHREY: That'll be all. For now.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.640
You know those moments where something clicks in your brain

39:49.680 --> 39:51.240
and suddenly everything becomes clear?

39:51.280 --> 39:52.920
-Not happening.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.920
Not even close.

40:26.400 --> 40:31.760
Best if you all go to bed, lock your doors,

40:26.400 --> 40:31.760
and don't let anybody in.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.040
Thank you.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.480
Now, Chief, here's a scary thought.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.760
What if the murderer thinks we're getting close

40:42.520 --> 40:44.760
to the solution?

40:44.800 --> 40:48.320
Well, then they'll be sorely disappointed because we're

40:44.800 --> 40:48.320
nowhere close to a solution.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.160
Chief. We meant...

40:50.200 --> 40:54.040
Yes, I know. Thank you, Dwayne,

40:50.200 --> 40:54.040
very reassuring.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.040
As Detective Inspector I have a duty of care.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.120
Nothing to do with the fact that I won't be able to sleep

40:58.080 --> 41:01.120
a wink with a killer upstairs.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.680
Look, sir, I don't mind staying up with you,

41:01.160 --> 41:02.680
it's okay. Nonsense.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.440
I need you all sharp and bright in the morning.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.320
Provided we last that long.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.520
Sorry, that was actually meant to be a joke,

41:12.560 --> 41:13.720
but under the circumstances...

41:13.760 --> 41:15.360
-Good night, sir. -Yes. Good night.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.640
Sir

41:42.880 --> 41:44.600
Oh. Hello.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.680
I couldn't sleep.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.880
I thought I might as well keep you company.

41:50.920 --> 41:51.960
Please...

42:14.600 --> 42:19.320
Sorry, I have to ask, erm, that whole thing about

42:14.600 --> 42:19.320
your police certificate.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.920
And your father hanging it up in the toilet.

42:22.960 --> 42:27.120
-Yes.

42:27.160 --> 42:30.840
-It was more of a guest

42:27.160 --> 42:30.840
bathroom than a toilet.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.040
Oh.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.360
It was just that...

42:33.400 --> 42:34.960
I suppose in a sense I can understand

42:35.000 --> 42:37.800
what Alexander's children have gone through.

42:37.840 --> 42:42.080
A successful father can cast quite a shadow over

42:37.840 --> 42:42.080
one's own achievements.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.760
But you're a Detective Inspector,

42:42.120 --> 42:44.760
that's fantastic.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.200
Well, I think so.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.840
He'd disagree.

42:48.880 --> 42:52.200
And there, in a nutshell, is many an

42:48.880 --> 42:52.200
uncomfortable family dinner.

42:56.120 --> 42:58.040
So, what did he say when you told him

42:58.080 --> 43:00.200
you were splitting up with your wife?

43:00.240 --> 43:02.880
Oh, er... He was, erm... He was fine about it.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.000
-Nope.

43:06.760 --> 43:10.440
And do you plan on doing so any time soon?

43:10.480 --> 43:12.520
Oh, I imagine I'll get around to it in about, erm...

43:13.960 --> 43:15.640
Two or three...

43:15.680 --> 43:16.720
Years. Sir...

43:17.840 --> 43:20.080
I know. It's just

43:22.720 --> 43:25.360
the marriage was the one time my parents

43:25.400 --> 43:26.960
seemed

43:27.000 --> 43:29.040
properly impressed, you know?

43:31.080 --> 43:32.600
Like Sally was just too good for me.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.520
Er...

43:34.560 --> 43:36.040
And, of course, they expected grandchildren.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.040
And, you know, I wasn't against the idea.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.760
Sally, on the other hand...

43:39.800 --> 43:41.200
She's a career woman.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.600
Exactly. Like yourself.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.680
No, I mean, I'd love to have children.

43:48.720 --> 43:52.120
I just need to meet the right man first.

43:53.640 --> 43:56.280
-You will meet the right man. No, definitely.

43:53.640 --> 43:56.280
-Yeah.

43:56.320 --> 43:59.560
You're funny, you're smart,

43:59.600 --> 44:01.160
you're beautiful...

44:03.280 --> 44:04.960
Sorry.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.760
Yes. You should apologise. I hate hearing how

44:05.000 --> 44:08.760
fantastic I am!

44:08.800 --> 44:11.680
Go on, then. Don't stop.

44:11.720 --> 44:15.440
Erm, well, this is a bit awkward, erm...

44:11.720 --> 44:15.440
It's just, er, well...

44:15.480 --> 44:16.920
Well, you're... You're you.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.040
Mmm-hmm.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.680
-And that... That's good. -Mmm-hmm.

44:20.720 --> 44:23.040
Er, so... So well done...

44:27.360 --> 44:28.760
DWAYNE: Chief?

44:28.800 --> 44:30.560
Oh, er, Sarge.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.800
Hey, I didn't come to check up on you or anything like that,

44:30.600 --> 44:33.800
you know.

44:33.840 --> 44:36.960
I'm quite sure you can handle yourselves in the event

44:33.840 --> 44:36.960
of any trouble.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.240
And yet here you are.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.200
Sir...

44:40.240 --> 44:41.680
Oh, hi! Hi.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.680
I didn't come to check up on you or anything like that...

44:44.720 --> 44:46.800
-Yes, I've already done that one.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.800
-All right.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.560
-Chief. I was just wondering something.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.120
-Er, well, not particularly.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.600
Just what I was wanting to hear.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.240
Okay, what we playing?

44:59.280 --> 45:00.880
Newmarket.

45:00.920 --> 45:02.760
-New... The four kings...

45:02.800 --> 45:04.480
Actually, we need two packs of cards...

45:02.800 --> 45:04.480
We don't have...

45:04.520 --> 45:07.280
-Caribbean poker. -I don't know how to play.

45:07.320 --> 45:08.480
Strip poker!

45:10.680 --> 45:12.120
No, I was just joking.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.800
Guys!

45:13.840 --> 45:15.880
Sorry! Erm, deal the cards!

45:26.400 --> 45:27.440
Sir?

45:29.880 --> 45:31.520
A little bit.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.160
Dwayne snores.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.320
Fidel snores. And you...

45:36.320 --> 45:38.400
Don't. Definitely not.

45:38.440 --> 45:40.600
So, where are Dwayne and Fidel?

45:40.640 --> 45:42.000
Not still asleep, surely?

45:42.040 --> 45:43.960
No, no. I told them to go and wake up everyone.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.480
Right.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.160
Well, we have an outside line now so I called the solicitor

45:47.200 --> 45:49.800
and asked him if he knew why Alexander wanted

45:47.200 --> 45:49.800
to meet on Monday.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.320
-He didn't know.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.320
Another dead end.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.440
Which brings us back to the suspects. All have a motive.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.880
-But only one has the proper means.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.880
-Joseph.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.600
Yes, but I still can't get past that alibi.

45:57.920 --> 46:01.600
Joseph on the treadmill.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.120
But he must have found a way around it

46:01.640 --> 46:04.120
because all the evidence...

46:04.160 --> 46:06.000
-Points to him. -Yes. It does.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.920
Chief. We can't find Joseph.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.080
DWAYNE: He's not in his bedroom

46:08.960 --> 46:11.080
and the window is open.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.440
We think he might have made a break for it.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.600
Right, we'll head to the jetty.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.480
You and Fidel check the rest of the island.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.480
Let's go!

46:24.840 --> 46:26.240
HUMPHREY: Stop!

46:41.200 --> 46:44.000
I'm placing you under arrest, for the murder of your father,

46:44.040 --> 46:45.360
Alexander Jackson.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.480
We're ready to cast off, Chief.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.880
Now, that's interesting. That's very interesting.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.480
HUMPHREY: Why's he not wearing his shirt?

47:10.520 --> 47:12.520
Bit odd, isn't it? Sat here and decides

47:10.520 --> 47:12.520
to take his shirt off?

47:13.720 --> 47:15.760
FIDEL: Snap!

47:15.800 --> 47:19.240
The bullet used to kill Alexander was fired

47:15.800 --> 47:19.240
from Joseph's pistol.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.720
He found only one set of fingerprints on the pistol.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.000
Yours. Chief?

47:30.640 --> 47:31.840
Hang on a minute.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.360
Maybe two.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.760
So, there's this riddle, about a dead body

47:56.800 --> 47:58.160
at the bottom of a building.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.600
And the detective who has to work out

48:01.640 --> 48:04.120
if the victim jumped or was pushed.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.280
So, he goes up every level...

48:06.320 --> 48:07.840
And he throws a coin out the window

48:07.880 --> 48:10.440
and he works out that the guy was pushed.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.560
-It's pretty old.

48:13.640 --> 48:14.760
Well, it's new to me.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.400
Right, well, how about the,

48:17.440 --> 48:20.000
er, riddle of Alexander Jackson's death?

48:21.280 --> 48:22.960
That's about as new as you can get.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.280
I thought Joseph...

48:24.320 --> 48:26.120
I thought he'd already been arrested for it?

48:26.160 --> 48:28.440
Ah, yes, of course. Our guest of honour.

48:29.600 --> 48:31.920
Right on time, Joseph. Take a seat.

48:38.360 --> 48:42.480
So, you'll have to admit that as far as riddles go,

48:38.360 --> 48:42.480
this one isn't easy.

48:42.520 --> 48:46.080
It's real for a start, and real life throws up

48:42.520 --> 48:46.080
awkward questions.

48:46.120 --> 48:48.880
Why was Alexander killed yesterday, before lunch?

48:48.920 --> 48:51.040
Why did he remove his shirt?

48:51.080 --> 48:53.400
And why was the one person whose fingerprints

48:51.080 --> 48:53.400
were all over

48:53.440 --> 48:56.840
the murder weapon also the only one

48:53.440 --> 48:56.840
with an alibi?

48:56.880 --> 48:58.400
Anyone care to have a crack at it?

48:59.240 --> 49:00.800
Mmm

49:02.440 --> 49:04.080
I don't know.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.120
Come on, have a guess.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.240
No

49:08.080 --> 49:09.160
Emily?

49:11.200 --> 49:12.600
No, I don't blame you. Because that's the whole point

49:15.480 --> 49:18.840
of the riddle. It was never meant to be one.

49:18.880 --> 49:21.560
There was never meant to be some puzzle for the police

49:18.880 --> 49:21.560
to grapple with.

49:21.600 --> 49:24.480
It was meant to be straightforward.

49:24.520 --> 49:28.080
A body is found. We show up. We find a bullet,

49:24.520 --> 49:28.080
murder weapon, fingerprints.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.840
All leading to Joseph, who we arrest.

49:29.880 --> 49:32.800
Case closed and we're all sipping cocktails

49:29.880 --> 49:32.800
by sunset. Lovely.

49:34.840 --> 49:36.480
Except...

49:42.120 --> 49:44.160
Except something went wrong.

49:44.200 --> 49:47.240
Joseph had planned to be on the beach

49:44.200 --> 49:47.240
that morning.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.000
But the weather looked like it was turning,

49:49.040 --> 49:52.560
so I decided just to head to the gym instead.

49:52.600 --> 49:56.240
HUMPHREY: And that weather forecast

49:52.600 --> 49:56.240
threw off the killer's plan.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.640
Joseph was never meant to be in the gym. Rosie was

49:56.280 --> 49:59.640
never meant to see him,

49:59.680 --> 50:01.000
and this puzzle

50:01.040 --> 50:03.360
that's been bothering me for so long,

50:01.040 --> 50:03.360
how can a man with

50:03.400 --> 50:05.680
a solid alibi kill his father?

50:05.720 --> 50:07.480
Was never meant to happen.

50:07.520 --> 50:09.840
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

50:09.880 --> 50:11.920
Really? All right, let me help.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.640
We've got Joseph's pistol, the murder weapon, right?

50:14.680 --> 50:16.200
-Yes. That's right. -Wrong.

50:17.560 --> 50:20.240
Alexander Jackson was killed with the shotgun.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.440
No...

50:21.480 --> 50:23.000
The officer said it was a pistol.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.280
No. He said a bullet had to have come from a pistol.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.200
Which, technically, it did.

50:27.240 --> 50:30.120
<i>Alexander's wound clearly</i> <i>showed that he had been</i>

50:30.160 --> 50:31.720
<i>shot by a bullet</i> <i>from a pistol.</i>

50:31.760 --> 50:33.840
Which naturally would mean a pistol was used,

50:33.880 --> 50:35.680
or at least that's what we were meant to think.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.200
Joseph fired six shots when he was practising,

50:42.160 --> 50:43.320
a full magazine.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.720
<i>But only five bullets</i> <i>were found.</i>

50:48.120 --> 50:50.400
So, where did the missing bullet go?

50:50.440 --> 50:53.760
And if you wanted to kill someone on a small island,

50:50.440 --> 50:53.760
why use a gun?

50:53.800 --> 50:57.040
They're noisy. Attract attention.

50:53.800 --> 50:57.040
Leave evidence.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.360
But...

50:59.400 --> 51:02.200
If you could use one to frame someone...

51:02.800 --> 51:04.520
FIDEL: Snap!

51:04.560 --> 51:06.640
HUMPHREY: <i> If the police knew</i> <i>that the bullet that killed</i>

51:06.680 --> 51:08.240
<i>Alexander had been</i> <i>fired from Joseph's gun,</i>

51:08.280 --> 51:11.120
<i>well, they'd assume the</i> <i>obvious. Joseph was guilty.</i>

51:11.160 --> 51:15.160
All the killer needed was that one bullet.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.960
You see, it was the shirt. The shirt gave it all away.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.880
His shirt was not removed before he was shot,

51:20.000 --> 51:24.880
it was after.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.080
<i>The killer removed Alexander's</i> <i>bloodied shirt</i>

51:27.120 --> 51:29.280
<i>because it was covered with</i> <i>evidence.</i>

51:29.320 --> 51:34.240
Gunpowder residue that proves that the shotgun was used

51:29.320 --> 51:34.240
to shoot Alexander.

51:34.280 --> 51:38.040
The shirt with the shotgun gunpowder residue

51:34.280 --> 51:38.040
still on it was taken

51:38.080 --> 51:39.440
away and replaced with a fresh shirt.

51:40.040 --> 51:42.160
No evidence.

51:46.920 --> 51:50.240
You know your way around guns. Gone shooting with your dad.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.880
I'd imagine you'd even know that you could take

51:50.280 --> 51:52.880
a pistol bullet

51:52.920 --> 51:57.360
even one that's already been fired and pack it

51:52.920 --> 51:57.360
into a shotgun shell.

52:00.080 --> 52:04.400
So, even though it's fired from a shotgun,

52:00.080 --> 52:04.400
the actual bullet

52:04.440 --> 52:05.920
that killed Alexander

52:07.040 --> 52:09.360
was a spent one from Joseph's gun.

52:14.960 --> 52:16.960
This is ridiculous.

52:17.000 --> 52:21.240
You tried your best to incriminate Joseph,

52:17.000 --> 52:21.240
didn't you?

52:21.280 --> 52:23.320
Using that bullet from his gun.

52:23.360 --> 52:26.840
Even giving us little hints and help along the way,

52:23.360 --> 52:26.840
about his past,

52:26.880 --> 52:28.960
his argument with Alexander the night before...

52:29.000 --> 52:33.320
Last night, I heard them arguing...

52:33.360 --> 52:37.800
Wait, sorry. You actually think

52:33.360 --> 52:37.800
I had something to do with it?

52:37.840 --> 52:40.320
I mean, what possible reason would I have for

52:37.840 --> 52:40.320
killing my father?

52:40.360 --> 52:42.560
Which was the final part of the puzzle to solve.

52:42.600 --> 52:44.440
Why now

52:46.080 --> 52:49.440
Because of a decision Alexander had made.

52:49.480 --> 52:53.720
A meeting planned with his solicitor on Monday

52:49.480 --> 52:53.720
to change his will.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.920
But Dad never mentioned anything about that.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.400
No. He didn't.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.040
But then, that wasn't his way.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.280
He didn't even tell me face-to-face.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.840
Just sent me a memo.

53:05.240 --> 53:07.320
That's his way.

53:07.360 --> 53:10.040
HUMPHREY: <i> Locked in</i> <i>Alexander's safe was</i>

53:07.360 --> 53:10.040
<i>a blank notepad.</i>

53:13.320 --> 53:15.320
I'd noticed that a page had been ripped out,

53:15.360 --> 53:17.920
but it didn't seem important to me at the time.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.200
And then it struck me.

53:19.240 --> 53:21.760
"Why would you lock a blank notepad in a safe?"

53:21.800 --> 53:24.000
I mean, you wouldn't. And yet he did.

53:24.040 --> 53:25.440
Which meant that whatever he'd written on it,

53:25.480 --> 53:27.640
must've been pretty important.

53:27.680 --> 53:29.560
Let's find out what that was.

53:29.600 --> 53:33.240
You see, pressure on the pad leaves indents

53:33.280 --> 53:35.600
even if the page above with the actual writing

53:33.280 --> 53:35.600
has been removed.

53:38.920 --> 53:42.000
It's a letter to his solicitor.

53:42.040 --> 53:44.720
Stating the terms and conditions of a new will

53:42.040 --> 53:44.720
to come

53:44.760 --> 53:47.400
into effect Monday morning.

53:48.800 --> 53:52.080
Explaining that since his wife passed away,

53:52.120 --> 53:55.600
he's become aware that his money has made

53:52.120 --> 53:55.600
some of his children

53:55.640 --> 53:57.800
spoilt. Entitled.

53:57.840 --> 54:00.680
How it's time for them to stand on their own two feet.

54:00.720 --> 54:03.880
He acknowledges that for some this won't make a difference.

54:03.920 --> 54:05.080
But for others,

54:06.560 --> 54:08.880
no more handouts.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.840
No more indulging of whims.

54:12.120 --> 54:14.800
Time to fend for yourselves. Without his help.

54:15.760 --> 54:17.680
No inheritance.

54:17.720 --> 54:21.000
No trust funds. No place in the company.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.880
Nothing.

54:22.920 --> 54:26.680
-You can't be serious!

54:26.720 --> 54:29.120
Even tried to put us off the scent by claiming

54:26.720 --> 54:29.120
you didn't know

54:29.160 --> 54:31.840
the combination to the safe, yet your fingerprints

54:29.160 --> 54:31.840
are all over it.

54:31.880 --> 54:34.520
<i>You read that letter.</i> <i>And you knew</i>

54:31.880 --> 54:34.520
<i>you had to act fast.</i>

54:37.880 --> 54:39.160
<i>If your father was still alive</i>

54:39.200 --> 54:40.720
<i>come Monday morning,</i>

54:40.760 --> 54:42.920
<i>then the will would change and</i> <i>you would be cut out forever.</i>

54:42.960 --> 54:44.800
<i>You weren't going to let</i> <i>that happen.</i>

54:49.080 --> 54:52.120
I'm calling my lawyer. This is nothing

54:49.080 --> 54:52.120
short of harassment.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.480
A lawyer would be a very smart move, actually.

54:54.520 --> 54:57.640
But I'm not sure you're as smart

54:54.520 --> 54:57.640
as you think you are.

55:00.600 --> 55:04.200
You see, a smart man would properly dispose

55:00.600 --> 55:04.200
of the bloodied shirt

55:04.240 --> 55:05.640
that Alexander had worn.

55:05.680 --> 55:07.960
And you tried.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.160
But you didn't try well enough, did you?

55:14.400 --> 55:17.840
No wonder your dad was disappointed in you.

55:17.880 --> 55:20.720
Couldn't even pull off a simple murder

55:17.880 --> 55:20.720
without screwing it up.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.080
He was going to cut us off, we lose everything.

55:25.120 --> 55:26.280
All of us!

55:26.920 --> 55:27.960
We'd have nothing!

55:34.920 --> 55:36.320
When did you find the shirt?

55:37.040 --> 55:38.560
I didn't.

55:38.600 --> 55:40.640
No idea where the real one is.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.320
This is the one he used for the switch.

55:42.360 --> 55:43.440
Sir...

55:45.280 --> 55:47.000
I can't help it if Terrance felt the need to confess.

55:48.120 --> 55:49.640
Oh, and Terrance?

55:52.520 --> 55:53.800
I didn't lose your pen.

56:06.080 --> 56:07.560
Shh.

56:27.360 --> 56:29.200
This is what it's all about, Fidel!

56:36.280 --> 56:39.360
-I'm going to do a fire walk.

56:39.400 --> 56:41.280
-Don't. You'll end up

56:39.400 --> 56:41.280
in hospital.

56:41.320 --> 56:43.640
-It's all in the mind. -Yes, and you're out of yours.

56:43.680 --> 56:44.760
I know!

56:53.680 --> 56:55.080
-Wait, you're, you're not... -Yeah.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.440
Someone needs to show them how it's done.

56:57.880 --> 56:59.400
Oh, right. You've done it before.

56:59.440 --> 57:03.560
Ah, no. Never. I mean, come on,

56:59.440 --> 57:03.560
walking on hot coals, fire.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.520
It's ridiculous. It's dangerous.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.520
And terrifying.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.440
-Yes, all good reasons to do something.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.440
-Well, kind of it is.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.280
You know, face your fears and all that.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.560
Yes, I'll remind you of this conversation when

57:13.000 --> 57:15.560
you're on fire.

57:19.320 --> 57:20.560
Whoo-hoo!

57:43.400 --> 57:44.960
Oh... Oh...

57:54.400 --> 57:56.920
Hello, Dad? Dad, it's Humphrey.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.880
Look, there's something I need to tell you.

58:05.120 --> 58:06.480
Better go and rest up if

58:06.520 --> 58:08.680
I'm going to have any energy for this dance tonight.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.000
Judith, have you seen Emma?

58:10.040 --> 58:11.520
Oh, not since this afternoon.

58:11.560 --> 58:12.800
-I can see her.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.440
CAMILLE: If she was going to take her own life,

58:16.480 --> 58:19.560
why get out a special dress like this and not put it on?

58:21.800 --> 58:25.040
Your wife came a long way to see you. It must be important.

58:25.080 --> 58:27.400
Letting you go, it's the biggest
