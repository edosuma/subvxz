00:04.526 --> 00:06.832
[inhales]

00:06.876 --> 00:09.009
[exhale]

00:12.099 --> 00:13.143
BELLA:
Um,

00:13.187 --> 00:15.363
Sarah, are you okay?

00:17.713 --> 00:20.716
Y-You-you were supposed to do
a press conference

00:20.759 --> 00:23.545
a-about the presentation.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.938
B-But it...
It's okay.

00:25.982 --> 00:30.073
Uh, I can tell them
we'll do it another day.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.392
â™ª

00:49.832 --> 00:51.225
Corinne!

00:52.052 --> 00:53.836
[crying]:
Danny, no, I can't.Corinne, wait!

00:53.879 --> 00:56.317
I really... I can't. I can't
right now. Please. I can't.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.709
I can't.Sarah's mic was on in there.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.929
The whole crowd just
heard you guys talking.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.713
Oh. Great.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.759
That's great.Is it true?

01:04.499 --> 01:06.066
What Sarah said, is it true?

01:06.109 --> 01:08.503
Is Josh my...?

01:08.546 --> 01:10.766
[panting]

01:14.552 --> 01:17.860
And you... you... you knew.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.644
This whole time,
you knew?

01:19.688 --> 01:21.168
I just found out, Danny.

01:21.211 --> 01:23.083
I just found out just now,
just like you.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.389
Just like the whole town,
apparently.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.479
No, I mean, you knew there was
a chance that Josh was my son.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.264
Why else would you take
a paternity test?

01:30.307 --> 01:31.613
Josh is not your son!

01:31.656 --> 01:33.571
You were not there
for the labor pains.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.095
You weren't there
for the late-night feedings.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.748
You weren't there for his fevers
or his broken wrist.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.924
It was just me and Adam.
Adam, who can't even look me

01:38.968 --> 01:40.578
in the eye anymore.You could've told me you had

01:40.622 --> 01:41.753
doubts
about who Josh's father was.

01:41.797 --> 01:44.713
How?! You left! You left

01:44.756 --> 01:47.237
before the morning
sickness kicked in,

01:47.281 --> 01:49.239
and I had no way
of contacting you!Maybe six years ago,

01:49.283 --> 01:52.112
sure. But I've been back
in Greylock for eight months!

01:52.155 --> 01:53.765
Eight months, Corinne!

01:53.809 --> 01:55.376
I just wish
you would've said something.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.681
Anything.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.078
Wow. You know, it's funny.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.036
When you left town
when we were kids,

02:04.080 --> 02:05.777
I used to wish
the exact same thing.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.302
That you would say
something to me.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.608
Anything.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.568
[car door opens]

02:13.611 --> 02:16.571
Hi. Um...[feedback whines]

02:16.614 --> 02:18.964
Yeah, hi. I-I know
that you were all

02:19.008 --> 02:22.794
hoping to speak to Sarah today,
but she can't make it.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.622
[indistinct chatter]

02:24.666 --> 02:27.059
She's really sorry.MAN:
I would be, too,

02:27.103 --> 02:28.626
if the whole world found out
I fudged the results

02:28.670 --> 02:30.280
of a paternity test.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.195
Especially
after that absurd presentation.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.808
Sarah's plan

02:36.852 --> 02:39.637
gives Greylock
short-term stability

02:39.681 --> 02:42.292
while setting us up
for long-term growth.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.772
The ink is barely dry
on your constitution,

02:43.815 --> 02:45.208
and she's already headed off

02:45.252 --> 02:47.558
on some useless quest
to woo the United States?

02:47.602 --> 02:49.081
Come on.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.867
Official recognition
would stabilize our economy,

02:51.910 --> 02:53.434
secure our sovereignty

02:53.477 --> 02:56.785
and get us access to foreign aid
and disaster relief.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.659
That doesn't sound useless
to me.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.186
Hey.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.319
Have you heard from Corinne?
I-I've called her,

03:09.363 --> 03:11.191
like, a million times.
She won't pick up.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.540
Probably 'cause
she doesn't want to talk to you.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.411
An impulse
she and I share, actually.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.196
I made a terrible mistake,

03:16.239 --> 03:17.893
AJ, I know.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.199
But I had my reasons.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.548
For telling the truth
or for lying

03:20.591 --> 03:21.853
in the first place?For both.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.377
When Corinne
took that paternity test,

03:23.420 --> 03:24.856
she wanted it to be Adam.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.293
She stood in this room,
and she cried in my arms,

03:26.336 --> 03:29.426
and she-she begged the universe
to make it Adam.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.123
So youmade it Adam.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.256
When the email came
and it was Danny's name,

03:33.300 --> 03:35.215
it's like I could...
I could see the future.

03:35.258 --> 03:38.740
Corinne's life
falling apart all over again

03:38.783 --> 03:42.396
because of my dickhead brother.

03:42.439 --> 03:45.268
And then I thought of Josh.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.663
Adam is an amazing dad.
To replace that?

03:48.706 --> 03:50.360
[voice breaking]:
I know what it's like,

03:50.404 --> 03:51.709
growing up with a father

03:51.753 --> 03:54.277
who runs
at the first sign of trouble.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.628
Josh doesn't deserve that.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.282
Nobody does.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.068
Danny being Josh's
biological father

04:03.112 --> 04:04.505
gives him rights
in a custody hearing.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.681
I had to tell Corinne the truth
to save Josh.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.335
He's not yours
to save, Sarah.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.162
My God, at some point,
you're gonna have to realize

04:10.206 --> 04:12.513
you don't know what's best
for everybody on the planet.

04:12.556 --> 04:13.992
I never said I knew.

04:14.036 --> 04:17.648
You don't have to.
It's clear you think you do.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.924
[breathing heavily]

04:34.448 --> 04:36.624
Oh, my God.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.818
SARAH:
I've been a fixer
for my whole life.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.733
It's who I am.

04:58.776 --> 05:01.605
I do not know how
to turn it off.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.868
Sarah, Sarah, you lied

05:03.912 --> 05:06.697
to the people that you
care the most about.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.657
Glass houses, Mom.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.050
Before I got sober,

05:12.094 --> 05:16.838
I thought the thing that was
going to save me was a hug...

05:18.100 --> 05:21.016
...when what I really needed
was a kick in the ass.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.452
Someone to look me in the eye
and tell me

05:22.496 --> 05:25.237
the cold, hard truth.

05:27.022 --> 05:30.765
You want a hug, Sarah?
I'm not going to give you one.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.029
It's gonna make things worse.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.639
I don't...

05:35.683 --> 05:38.381
I don't need a hug.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.994
I need to say I'm sorry.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.999
I found out
that you have a grandson,

05:48.043 --> 05:50.524
and I didn't tell you,

05:50.567 --> 05:52.526
and I am sorry.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.397
I am sorry.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.710
[exhales]

06:02.753 --> 06:05.669
I thought you didn't want
to talk to me.Was Sarah right?

06:05.713 --> 06:07.410
Does you being
Josh's biological father

06:07.454 --> 06:09.760
change the math
on this custody thing?

06:09.804 --> 06:10.761
Yeah.Okay.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.197
How?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.025
I would probably be granted
partial custody

06:14.069 --> 06:15.679
if I petitioned the court.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.029
If that happened, a judge
would keep Josh in Greylock.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.857
Two parents here
versus one somewhere else.

06:19.901 --> 06:20.945
Okay, I need you
to petition the court.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.033
Corinne.No.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.687
I need Josh in Greylock.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.037
I-I want to help, but...

06:26.081 --> 06:28.300
Most times, I feel like I'm...

06:28.344 --> 06:30.781
I'm barely keeping
my own head above water.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.914
To suddenly be...

06:32.957 --> 06:35.177
someone's dad...
[exhales]

06:35.220 --> 06:37.484
I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

06:37.527 --> 06:40.443
I'm not asking you
to take him for pancakes

06:40.487 --> 06:41.879
or take him camping.

06:41.923 --> 06:45.100
I'm asking for your signature,
not your time.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.973
When I was 17 and alone,

06:49.017 --> 06:51.715
I needed you,
and you weren't there.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.588
When I found out
that I was pregnant,

06:54.631 --> 06:56.503
I was terrified.

06:56.546 --> 07:00.071
I needed you,
and you weren't there.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.247
When I was about to get married,

07:02.291 --> 07:05.294
all I wanted was
for you to come back to Greylock

07:05.337 --> 07:07.209
and take me away
from all of this. I needed you.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.429
I needed you,
and you weren't there.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.822
So, Danny, please,

07:11.866 --> 07:15.435
for once in your life, be there.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.271
Hey.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.751
Corinne?[clears throat]

07:27.795 --> 07:29.840
Corinne, you have
to let me explain.No,

07:29.884 --> 07:31.276
Okay?I know what happened. You lied.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.887
You have to understand
that I was trying to help you.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.105
I was trying...No, you were trying to be

07:34.149 --> 07:36.107
in control like
you always are.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.892
Do you know that when,

07:37.935 --> 07:40.242
um, you told me
the results of the DNA test,

07:40.285 --> 07:42.374
it never even occurred to me
to look at the email myself

07:42.418 --> 07:44.376
because I knew that you
would never lie to me

07:44.420 --> 07:45.682
about something like that.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.206
I thought I knew.
[scoffs]

07:48.250 --> 07:50.731
I really didn't want my brother
to ruin your life.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.081
That's right, mylife!
My life, Sarah! Mine!

07:53.124 --> 07:54.778
Not yours.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.693
Deciding what to do with
the results of the DNA test,

07:56.737 --> 07:58.652
it should've been my choice.
It should...

07:58.695 --> 08:00.262
And you took it from me.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.395
Here is one choice you
don't get to steal.

08:03.439 --> 08:06.486
I'm never speaking to you again.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.010
No, Corinne. Corinne?

08:09.053 --> 08:10.751
Hey. Hey.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.276
â™ª Babe

08:14.319 --> 08:16.017
GROVER:
It's me, Bear.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.454
â™ª There's no use
in wondering... â™ª

08:18.498 --> 08:20.935
I found your Super 8 camera.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.850
Uh,

08:22.893 --> 08:27.507
Tyler used your footage
to make this...

08:27.550 --> 08:31.380
amazing film about us.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.426
And after watching it,

08:34.470 --> 08:38.126
it helped me replace
some of those bad memories

08:38.169 --> 08:39.867
with some good ones.

08:39.910 --> 08:43.914
And between that and therapy,

08:43.958 --> 08:46.700
I think I'm gonna be okay.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.571
I have a long way to go,

08:48.615 --> 08:51.966
and I miss you like crazy,

08:52.009 --> 08:54.185
but I think I'm gonna be okay.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.276
Wherever you are, I hope...

08:58.320 --> 09:00.017
[breathes deeply]

09:00.061 --> 09:02.846
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.546
You can rest now.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.114
Just rest.

09:10.158 --> 09:15.206
â™ª Always tune
to your own sound â™ª

09:15.990 --> 09:19.776
â™ª We open our eyes

09:19.820 --> 09:21.778
â™ª To see...

09:21.822 --> 09:23.693
PAUL:
There you are.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.609
Thought I might
find you up here.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.568
[chuckles]
Nowhere else to hide.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.179
I'm fine, Paul. I'm fine.

09:31.222 --> 09:35.226
â™ª Fickle,
but leading our own path â™ª

09:37.794 --> 09:40.884
â™ª And race to that summer

09:40.928 --> 09:44.453
[crying]â™ª And summer is far
from home... â™ª

09:45.280 --> 09:46.890
You know, on a
really clear day,

09:46.934 --> 09:49.850
you can see all the way to
Hazzard Notch from here.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.548
Little village with the
apple cider doughnuts.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.638
Those were your favorites
when you were a little kid.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.814
I remember.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.686
Look, I know you're upset

09:59.729 --> 10:03.690
about this thing with,
uh, Danny and Corinne.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.257
Your friends
all being mad at you.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.825
If you're determined
to beat yourself up about it,

10:08.869 --> 10:11.523
I-I get it.
I understand that.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.395
Just know
that someday soon,

10:13.438 --> 10:16.354
you will have a chance
to redeem yourself.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.748
So be ready.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.579
That's not a chance
you want to miss.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.061
â™ª We'll take the open road.

10:27.104 --> 10:30.630
Take it from somebody
who's missed plenty.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.026
AJ:
You're telling me there's not

10:36.070 --> 10:38.376
a single room available
in your whole building?

10:40.204 --> 10:42.032
Okay. Thank you.

10:42.076 --> 10:45.383
â™ª What's the crimson light...

10:45.427 --> 10:47.559
Everything all right?

10:47.603 --> 10:48.778
No, not really.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.824
â™ª Sudden change of heart...

10:50.867 --> 10:52.434
Is this about your dad?

10:52.477 --> 10:53.696
How do you know about my dad?

10:53.740 --> 10:54.741
Well, my sister picked up

10:54.784 --> 10:56.090
a few shifts at his place,

10:56.133 --> 10:59.484
and I brought some doughnuts
over there

10:59.528 --> 11:00.921
and saw your photo in his room.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.357
Have you told anyone?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.054
Not my story to tell.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.928
He really seemed
happy in that place.Yeah.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.407
A giant medical company
is buying it,

11:09.451 --> 11:12.759
so I got to find somewhere else
for him to live.

11:12.802 --> 11:16.284
Sorry to hear that. Good
luck with the search.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.678
Thanks, Tyler.

11:21.506 --> 11:24.292
[sighs]

11:32.517 --> 11:35.695
[footsteps approaching]

11:40.700 --> 11:42.919
State Department?

11:42.963 --> 11:43.920
Is it that obvious?

11:43.964 --> 11:45.139
I've never seen you

11:45.182 --> 11:46.662
in Greylock before.
I'm guessing

11:46.706 --> 11:49.317
that that bulge on your hip
is a gun.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.755
Given that my father's
presence here

11:52.799 --> 11:54.670
just became headline news...

11:54.714 --> 11:56.672
Gina Saunders.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.065
Diplomatic Security.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.284
Special agent.You're wasting your time here.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.721
Greylock
is a nonextradition country.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.766
The American government
has no authority

12:03.810 --> 12:05.594
to arrest our residents.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.161
I know.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.684
Why are you here?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.512
To offer you
official recognition

12:10.555 --> 12:11.774
from the United States.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.433
A pat on the head
from the Stars and Stripes

12:18.476 --> 12:22.959
makes this little poli-sci
experiment of yours legit.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.963
If you, as
Greylock's leader,

12:27.007 --> 12:29.357
allow us to arrest Paul Cooper,

12:29.400 --> 12:32.752
the State Department is prepared
to fast-track that recognition.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.841
Three months,

12:34.884 --> 12:38.758
and Greylock can finally
leave the kids' table

12:38.801 --> 12:41.151
and come and sit
with the adults.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.158
Let me know.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.559
Yeah, I'm not surprised the
State Department reached out.

12:57.602 --> 13:00.040
I amsurprised that
you told me about it.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.085
After the Corinne thing,
if I'm gonna make a decision

13:02.129 --> 13:04.566
about someone's life,
they're gonna help me make it.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.830
Um, so, what would...

13:07.874 --> 13:09.310
what would happen to you

13:09.353 --> 13:10.920
if I...?Well,

13:10.964 --> 13:13.009
first, they would spend
a few days making sure

13:13.053 --> 13:15.925
that I'm not sitting
on any more stolen documents.

13:15.969 --> 13:19.842
Are you?Chief of staff's
March Madness bracket.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.322
POTUS's email asking

13:21.365 --> 13:23.063
if he gets to see the
new Star Warsearly

13:23.106 --> 13:24.281
because he's POTUS.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.370
I'm a walking WikiLeaks.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.894
Now, after they discover

13:27.937 --> 13:31.680
that I have dumped all the
information that I had,

13:31.723 --> 13:33.247
there will be a trial,
at which point

13:33.290 --> 13:34.683
I will be found guilty.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.728
But if you had
a really good lawyer and...

13:36.772 --> 13:38.905
The whole point of this crime
is to leave a paper trail.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.211
You could replace my prosecutor
with a horse,

13:41.255 --> 13:43.866
and I'd still be convicted.You did the right thing.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.521
You should be in a parade,
not a prison.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.051
Yeah. Recognition for Greylock
would be huge.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.053
I know.This process

13:57.097 --> 13:59.490
can take years
if it happens at all.

13:59.534 --> 14:03.364
And God forbid you wind up
like Abkhazia or South Ossetia.No, I know.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.235
Endlessly floundering
in the waters

14:05.279 --> 14:06.541
of partial recognition.

14:06.584 --> 14:10.023
No stability. No security.No future.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.938
Recognition for Greylock

14:11.981 --> 14:14.766
would be the final step
in becoming a real country.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.813
All it costs
is one absent father.Mm.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.990
Formerlyabsent.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.603
[grunts]
You do realize

14:25.647 --> 14:27.954
I, I could still run.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.393
Drop off the map again.
Everything falls apart.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.047
I know.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.962
But you told me anyway.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.398
You didn't hide it.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.835
Maybe that was foolish.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.535
But at least it was honest.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.108
BELLA:
Hey, Dad. You got a sec?

14:52.152 --> 14:54.458
Sure, sweetie. What's up?

14:54.502 --> 14:56.591
So, you know
how I've been working with Sarah

14:56.634 --> 14:58.593
for my sophomore study project.Mm-hmm.

14:58.636 --> 15:01.509
Well, helping her,
helping to build Greylock,

15:01.552 --> 15:03.032
I feel more like me.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.689
But the thing is
I have to go back

15:07.732 --> 15:09.256
to regular classes
in three weeks,

15:09.299 --> 15:12.955
and I won't be able
to help Sarah full-time anymore.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.565
Mm-hmm.

15:14.609 --> 15:18.221
So, I was thinking maybe I
could skip the spring semester.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.789
What? Bella...Come on, Dad,

15:20.832 --> 15:22.356
I can go back to school
in the fall.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.184
But if I help Sarah now,

15:24.227 --> 15:27.013
I can work with her full-time
throughout the summer.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.231
Absolutely not.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.711
Come on, Dad. Plenty of kids

15:29.754 --> 15:31.321
take time off from high school.

15:31.365 --> 15:34.281
Yeah. They're called
juvenile offenders.I'm gonna

15:34.324 --> 15:35.673
learn way more from Sarah

15:35.717 --> 15:37.632
than I ever would
reciting sonnets

15:37.675 --> 15:39.634
or doing long division.Okay.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.376
Bella,
I love that you're so inspired,

15:42.419 --> 15:43.725
and you should
keep helping Sarah--

15:43.768 --> 15:45.379
during your free time.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.903
But I'm not going to let you
drop out

15:47.947 --> 15:49.600
of high school.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.434
[music playing]

16:04.572 --> 16:06.966
You know,
they have books on tape now.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.447
Easier for older eyes.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.930
I'm looking for a job.What?

16:14.974 --> 16:18.586
JD from Penn,
a lauded political career,

16:18.629 --> 16:20.762
author of many
successful books?

16:20.805 --> 16:22.764
Think a job
would be looking for you.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.070
Until they Web-search my name,

16:24.113 --> 16:26.463
and then they see
four million versions

16:26.507 --> 16:28.161
of my TV confession.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.946
Apparently, I'm a meme.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.295
Whatever that is.

16:32.339 --> 16:36.169
Yeah, well, what do you
want a job for, anyway?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.303
Because I'm gonna lose
my marbles

16:40.347 --> 16:42.436
if I just sit around my house,

16:42.479 --> 16:45.656
spinning my wheels, thinking
about a grandchild that I have

16:45.700 --> 16:48.050
that I'll probably
never be allowed to see.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.617
Ah.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.533
You seem very nonchalant

16:52.576 --> 16:54.926
about
this grandchild revelation.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.146
Are you not angry at Sarah?

16:58.495 --> 17:00.236
I-I've been around enough

17:00.280 --> 17:02.325
to know the world's
a pretty broken place.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.284
Darkness everywhere you look.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.721
That doesn't mean you
shouldn't try and find a light.

17:06.764 --> 17:10.855
Our little girl, who's...
not so little anymore,

17:10.899 --> 17:13.119
lives in the trying.

17:14.424 --> 17:18.602
As long as that's true, how
could I be mad at her? I mean...

17:27.220 --> 17:29.961
After everything
you've put me through,

17:30.005 --> 17:32.138
do you really have to parade him
around in front of me?

17:32.181 --> 17:33.356
Do you think

17:33.400 --> 17:34.618
some dumb DNA test

17:34.662 --> 17:35.793
is gonna stop me
from loving my son?

17:35.837 --> 17:37.360
No, and I don't want it to.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.320
But... [clears throat] what
that dumb DNA test does do

17:40.363 --> 17:43.888
is it allows Danny to petition
for partial custody of Josh.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.195
And that's exactly
what he will do unless

17:46.239 --> 17:48.502
you agree to an arrangement
that keeps Josh in Greylock.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.678
I've already talked
to my lawyer,

17:50.721 --> 17:52.027
and Danny's involvement

17:52.071 --> 17:53.855
will swing this whole thing
in my favor.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.294
Adam,

17:58.338 --> 17:59.730
you're an amazing dad.

17:59.774 --> 18:02.342
Josh loves you, and he
needs you in his life.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.865
But I love him, too,
and I'm not gonna let you

18:03.908 --> 18:05.214
take him away from me.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.998
So, if you want a war,

18:07.042 --> 18:09.349
I will give you
the nuclear version.

18:09.392 --> 18:13.353
Or you and I
can come to a peaceful solution

18:13.396 --> 18:16.356
that allows our son to grow up
with happy memories

18:16.399 --> 18:17.661
instead of sad ones.

expand my garden.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.546
When it's done,

18:32.589 --> 18:35.070
"tulips"
won't even do it justice.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.507
You're gonna have to call them
"three-lips."

21:37.557 --> 21:39.080
on the "decline" button
for your taste.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.429
Tell me you're not actually

21:40.473 --> 21:41.996
considering giving Dad
to the State Department.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.390
I don't want to,

21:44.433 --> 21:46.087
Danny, but recognition

21:46.130 --> 21:47.567
would guarantee
this country's future.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.047
I have to think
about what Greylock needs.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.266
What Greylock needs is a leader

21:51.310 --> 21:52.876
who won't trade people
for stuff!

21:52.920 --> 21:54.748
Never mind the fact

21:54.791 --> 21:56.967
that the person you're thinking
about trading is our father!

21:57.011 --> 21:59.143
What is this, some
kind of revenge?

21:59.187 --> 22:01.058
You getting back at him
for all the time he was away?

22:01.102 --> 22:02.408
We were just
starting to feel

22:02.451 --> 22:04.497
like a real family
for the first time,

22:04.540 --> 22:06.803
and you want to throw that away.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.158
Just tell me
you're not gonna give him up.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.291
Sarah,

22:16.335 --> 22:18.380
tell me
you're not gonna give him up.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.305
[knock on door]

22:30.349 --> 22:32.394
You got to get
out of here now.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.135
[chuckles]:
Whoa, slow down.

22:34.178 --> 22:35.441
What's going on, cowboy?

22:35.484 --> 22:36.833
This thing
with the State Department.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.531
Sarah's gonna turn you in.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.707
You're supposed to have dinner
with her tonight, right?Yeah.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.971
It's a trap, Dad. You can't go.Look, Sarah's been cards up

22:44.014 --> 22:45.451
about the state's offer
from the start.

22:45.494 --> 22:48.236
Why-why would she want
to conspire now?

22:48.279 --> 22:49.629
All Sarah does is conspire.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.587
The whole town got a taste of it
a couple of days ago

22:51.631 --> 22:54.503
with this delightful little
DNA public service announcement.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.070
I trust Sarah.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.419
Trust me,Dad.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.116
She's already made up
her mind.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.423
You got to go back
into hiding.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.470
You've done it before,
you can do it again. But you got

23:04.513 --> 23:06.210
to leave now
if you want a head start.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.172
Dad!

23:11.215 --> 23:12.652
Yeah. No, you're right.

23:12.695 --> 23:15.306
I j-just... I got to go.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.179
I'm sorry.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.659
I'm the sorry one.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.530
I never should've put you two
in this situation.

23:21.574 --> 23:24.098
It was selfish.Nah, don't say that.
I'm just...

23:24.141 --> 23:28.145
I'm just glad I got a chance
to get to know you again.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.714
Because you may not see me
for a while,

23:31.758 --> 23:35.675
I'd like to leave you with
a little bit of paternal advice.

23:35.718 --> 23:39.026
This thing with Corinne

23:39.069 --> 23:41.420
and you being
that little boy's father.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.685
Look at me.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.861
You were made for this, Dan.

23:47.904 --> 23:50.820
No matter what anyone else says.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.475
I love you.

23:54.258 --> 23:57.218
[Danny grunts, sniffles]

23:57.261 --> 23:59.960
I love you, too, Dad.

24:00.003 --> 24:04.268
â™ª Oh, what a love we have...

24:04.312 --> 24:06.445
SARAH:
Hi, Paul.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.707
It's me again.
I'm just wondering

24:07.750 --> 24:09.056
if you're still coming.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.318
Um, I was really hoping
we could talk

24:10.361 --> 24:12.668
about
this State Department stuff

24:12.712 --> 24:14.061
some more.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.628
Between that
and, um, the mess I made

24:15.671 --> 24:18.500
with Corinne's paternity test,
there's just...

24:18.544 --> 24:20.197
there's a lot of noise
in my head right now.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.591
But talking to you
the last few days,

24:22.635 --> 24:24.419
having you around,

24:24.463 --> 24:26.987
you've-you've been shelter
from the storm, you have.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.990
I'm really glad you're
in Greylock, so, anyway...

24:30.033 --> 24:34.298
Okay. I'll be here.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.019
[door opens]

25:00.324 --> 25:03.589
Sorry I'm late.
Stopped by Hazzard Notch

25:03.632 --> 25:06.287
to pick up the apple cider
doughnuts that you love.SARAH: Aw.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.768
Thank you. Oh, they smell good.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.204
We can have them after dinner.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.945
Actually,
I can't stay for dinner.

25:11.988 --> 25:15.514
Federal agents outside.
Don't want to keep them waiting.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.474
What are you talking about?
I'm not taking the deal.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.258
Official recognition
is important,

25:21.302 --> 25:24.044
but it is not worth
trading a person for.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.002
You or anyone else.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.787
The surest way to get recognized

25:27.830 --> 25:30.398
is to take
the State Department's offer.

25:30.441 --> 25:33.053
I told you.
I'm not taking the deal.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.750
Well, I am.

25:35.925 --> 25:38.406
I'm-I'm turning myself in.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.670
[chuckles]:
They're, they're here.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.067
No. No. No.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.025
No, no. Paul,
this is not what I want.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.374
It's what Iwant.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.333
I want it. I've watched you

25:52.376 --> 25:54.727
for the past few months,
and-and you fight tooth and nail

25:54.770 --> 25:57.947
for the things you care about.
You're brave, you're loyal,

25:57.991 --> 25:59.862
and you're selfless.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.343
All the things I want to be
when I grow up.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.650
What can I say, kid?
You set a good example.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.390
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Stop. I don't...

26:06.434 --> 26:07.696
Please. I don't want this.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.002
Thank you
for letting me get to know you.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.438
You're an incredible person,

26:10.481 --> 26:13.223
and I'm very proud
to be your father.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.881
It's okay.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.796
It's all right.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.276
It's okay.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.147
â™ª Silver in my travels...

26:24.191 --> 26:26.367
Taken so much from you.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.630
About time
I give something back.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.719
â™ª I'm starting to unravel...

26:30.763 --> 26:33.592
Love you, princess.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.115
â™ª Heartbeat on a downhill

26:35.158 --> 26:36.595
I love you, too, Dad.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.598
â™ª I counted 18 on my pulse

26:39.641 --> 26:43.079
â™ª As Kilrenny Church
struck three for 3:00 â™ª

26:43.123 --> 26:47.388
â™ª What else?

26:53.133 --> 26:59.182
â™ª What else?

27:03.230 --> 27:05.449
â™ª And you said

27:05.493 --> 27:08.583
â™ª 12 years in retirement

27:08.627 --> 27:12.326
â™ª The hours go by
like sips of water â™ª

27:12.369 --> 27:15.546
â™ª The record lies unbroken

27:15.590 --> 27:19.594
â™ª And no doubt
it's white flour in my diet â™ª

27:19.638 --> 27:21.378
â™ª It's going to be

27:21.422 --> 27:22.945
â™ª The death of me

27:22.989 --> 27:24.425
â™ª Sweet drumroll

27:24.468 --> 27:30.649
â™ª For those embittered
big ideas â™ª

27:36.437 --> 27:41.268
â™ª It's such a waste

27:41.311 --> 27:45.794
â™ª Of all that I had

27:47.578 --> 27:52.845
â™ª You mentioned bats
in the attic â™ª

27:52.888 --> 27:55.717
â™ª So now you're lifting up
the tiles â™ª

27:55.761 --> 27:59.025
â™ª To get around
those conservation rules â™ª

27:59.068 --> 28:04.334
â™ª I faced

28:05.988 --> 28:10.950
â™ª And it's such a waste

28:10.993 --> 28:16.129
â™ª Of all that we had

28:16.172 --> 28:21.308
â™ª And it's such a waste

28:21.351 --> 28:27.140
â™ª Of all that we had

28:27.183 --> 28:31.884
â™ª And it's such a waste

28:31.927 --> 28:37.280
â™ª Of all that we had

28:39.065 --> 28:43.460
â™ª And it's such a waste

28:43.504 --> 28:48.117
â™ª Of all that I am.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.690
["Famous" by Hailaker playing]

28:56.996 --> 28:59.433
â™ª You told that guy

28:59.476 --> 29:03.567
â™ª Where he could take it

29:05.221 --> 29:08.877
â™ª You couldn't contain it

29:10.226 --> 29:12.359
â™ª Honestly...

29:12.402 --> 29:14.927
I talked to the State Department
this morning,

29:14.970 --> 29:19.105
gave them my official okay
to arrest Dad in Greylock.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.194
So it's...

29:21.237 --> 29:23.544
it's all legal now.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.851
Between that
and lying about Josh,

29:25.894 --> 29:27.548
you must really hate me.

29:27.591 --> 29:30.246
Well, I'm trying to.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.771
I'm not having much luck.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.076
Why not?

29:34.120 --> 29:36.862
Because you're my sister.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.908
Dad had a chance to run.

29:39.952 --> 29:43.390
He chose not to.
That was his decision.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.784
â™ª Stayed like that

29:45.827 --> 29:47.394
With Corinne...

29:47.437 --> 29:50.179
â™ª This isn't the way...

29:50.223 --> 29:52.225
I don't like what you did.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.227
â™ª Couldn't you cave?

29:54.270 --> 29:56.316
But I get why you did it.

29:56.359 --> 29:57.708
â™ª I have...

29:57.752 --> 29:59.667
I wouldn't want me near her,
either.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.495
Especially after everything

30:01.538 --> 30:02.626
I put her through.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.237
â™ª What you want...

30:04.280 --> 30:06.630
I'm leaving town in two days.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.330
My transfer
finally came through.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.419
I thought
you were gonna petition

30:12.462 --> 30:14.900
for partial custody of Josh.No,

30:14.943 --> 30:16.771
that was just a threat
to get Adam to knock it off

30:16.815 --> 30:18.947
with the supervillain routine.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.819
â™ª And I won't...

30:20.862 --> 30:24.083
Once he realized
Corinne had him beat,

30:24.126 --> 30:26.781
he-he caved.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.739
So that's it? You're just gonna
walk away from your son?

30:28.783 --> 30:31.351
Josh already has two parents.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.440
Three's a crowd.

30:34.223 --> 30:37.879
You in Greylock
would improve his life, Danny.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.533
You know how I know?
Because you in Greylock

30:39.576 --> 30:42.884
improved my life.
It improved your life.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.887
You've been the best version
of yourself since you came here.

30:45.931 --> 30:49.151
â™ª And it was contagious...

30:49.195 --> 30:52.546
You're a part of this community
now. We need you.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.113
â™ª Same right hand...

30:54.156 --> 30:55.679
No, you don't.Yeah, we do.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.551
The Coopers are a mess.

30:57.594 --> 30:59.509
â™ª Stay like that...

30:59.553 --> 31:02.599
The list of problems
that our family has caused

31:02.643 --> 31:05.559
is longer than my arm, but...

31:05.602 --> 31:07.517
but look at our parents.

31:07.561 --> 31:10.085
Mom's working so hard
at her sobriety.

31:10.129 --> 31:13.045
Dad has turned himself in
to answer for his crimes.

31:13.088 --> 31:14.960
"Dad," huh?

31:15.003 --> 31:17.658
â™ª If I can't be
what you want... â™ª

31:17.701 --> 31:19.790
If those two can
muster the courage

31:19.834 --> 31:22.184
to face their mistakes, then...

31:22.228 --> 31:25.187
[inhales deeply]

31:25.231 --> 31:27.494
...so can we.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.149
Come on, Danny.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.107
It's time to stop running.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.415
â™ª And I won't

31:35.458 --> 31:38.853
â™ª Say it again.

31:42.596 --> 31:45.729
WILLIAM:Sarah.Oh.

31:46.992 --> 31:50.256
Oh, not today, William.
Can you please maybe yell at me

31:50.299 --> 31:53.694
about corrupting your daughter
tomorrow or some...

31:53.737 --> 31:55.696
any... literally any other day?

31:55.739 --> 31:57.959
I-I'm not gonna
yell at you, Sarah.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.961
I'm gonna apologize.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.616
For what?

32:02.659 --> 32:05.314
For the way I acted since
you became our leader.

32:05.358 --> 32:09.101
Look, I was just... jealous.

32:09.144 --> 32:12.278
You know, you took my
job as head of Greylock,

32:12.321 --> 32:15.934
and within 24 hours you were
doing it better than I ever did.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.720
Thank you, William.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.896
Why the change of heart?

32:21.940 --> 32:22.984
Bella.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.987
You helped her
find her calling.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.989
You helped her
find her voice.

32:28.033 --> 32:31.297
Since you came into her
world, Bella has grown into

32:31.340 --> 32:33.690
a confident, brave,

32:33.734 --> 32:36.084
driven version of herself,

32:36.128 --> 32:38.391
and I'd be crazy
to take that away from her.

32:38.434 --> 32:39.958
BELLA:
My dad's decided

32:40.001 --> 32:42.569
to register me as a homeschool
student for the next semester,

32:42.612 --> 32:45.224
and I'm gonna do
all my classes

32:45.267 --> 32:46.703
on nights and weekends

32:46.747 --> 32:48.227
so I can be your intern
full-time throughout the week.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.707
Are you sure about this,
William?WILLIAM: I'm sure.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.840
I get to spend more time
with Bella, anyway.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.755
[Bella chuckles]And in the meantime,

32:54.798 --> 32:58.672
there's no better person
to look out for my daughter.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.761
â™ª Is bad of your heart

33:03.459 --> 33:06.941
â™ª I'm not here to pick a fight

33:06.985 --> 33:09.378
â™ª But we can if you like...

33:09.422 --> 33:11.032
Hey.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.555
Sarah.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.079
Yeah.I found this

33:14.122 --> 33:15.254
on my bed. What is it?

33:15.297 --> 33:17.169
A treaty, potentially.

33:17.212 --> 33:18.257
A treaty between who?

33:18.300 --> 33:19.693
Between Greylock

33:19.736 --> 33:21.173
and the state of New Hampshire.
Potentially.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.609
Why is my name on it?

33:22.652 --> 33:24.263
Because it's your treaty.
Poten...

33:24.306 --> 33:27.005
Potentially. I got that part.

33:27.744 --> 33:31.096
Um, I-I looked into the company

33:31.139 --> 33:33.402
that's buying your dad's place.
MediCo.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.970
There's a lot of data that says
that conglomerates like them

33:36.014 --> 33:37.885
jacking up the price
of local facilities

33:37.928 --> 33:40.757
has a seriously negative effect
on public health.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.759
That treaty forms an alliance

33:42.803 --> 33:46.067
with New Hampshire against
predatory medical companies.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.113
Long story short,
it would stop MediCo

33:48.156 --> 33:50.811
from buying
your father's facility.

33:50.854 --> 33:53.205
Governor Taggert
will go for this?

33:53.248 --> 33:54.815
[grunts softly]

33:54.858 --> 33:57.687
I told her it was important
to my citizens.

33:57.731 --> 34:01.169
So you put yourself
in her pocket to help me.

34:01.213 --> 34:04.781
I would put myself
in her guillotine

34:04.825 --> 34:06.305
if it meant helping you.

34:06.348 --> 34:09.308
But this isn't about you and me.
This is about public policy.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.570
â™ª The whole thing is...

34:10.613 --> 34:12.093
You were right, AJ.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.529
I don't know what's best
for everyone on the planet.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.096
I put your name
on that treaty.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.837
It's your treaty now.
You will oversee the creation

34:16.880 --> 34:18.273
and the approval of it

34:18.317 --> 34:20.493
as a, an elected member
of Greylock's council.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.103
You know what your father needs.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.888
You know what people like him
need way more than I do,

34:24.932 --> 34:26.716
so you should be the one
who makes sure they get it.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.676
â™ª To see the whole thing

34:29.719 --> 34:32.113
â™ª Is an opening...

34:32.157 --> 34:34.159
Thanks, Sarah.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.683
Mm.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.859
ELLEN:
This week hasn't been easy.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.948
I tried to get a job,

34:40.991 --> 34:42.341
something to keep me busy,

34:42.384 --> 34:45.039
and no one's hiring.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.041
Seems like the shadows
of my past

34:47.085 --> 34:49.609
are longer than I realized.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.046
And then to make things worse,

34:52.090 --> 34:55.093
my daughter
admitted that she lied

34:55.136 --> 34:58.574
about the results
of a paternity test.

34:59.358 --> 35:02.100
A test that...

35:03.188 --> 35:06.582
...revealed
that I'm a grandmother.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.720
Um, in the past
all of that would've sent me

35:13.763 --> 35:15.722
right to the bottom of a bottle,

35:15.765 --> 35:18.942
but today it's brought me here.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.554
So much of modern life
is binary.

35:21.597 --> 35:23.860
It's on, off. Hot, cold.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.514
Good or bad.

35:25.558 --> 35:30.432
And the truth is we all live
somewhere in between.

35:31.216 --> 35:35.133
All we can do
is try our best to be

35:35.176 --> 35:37.091
the person that we want to be

35:37.135 --> 35:41.661
and just to keep on trying
whenever we fail.

35:42.444 --> 35:45.839
So, from now on,
that's what I'm gonna do.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.842
To live in the trying.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.283
The trying is all.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.852
[punk music playing][indistinct chatter]

36:00.288 --> 36:01.681
GROVER:Sarah?

36:02.812 --> 36:04.466
What the hell happened to you?

36:04.510 --> 36:08.122
Oh, I caught an elbow
to the face during the opener.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.819
You okay?

36:09.863 --> 36:12.213
Yeah. If you're still bleeding,
you're still breathing, right?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.607
I had no idea you
were coming tonight.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.304
What the hell
are you doing here?

36:16.348 --> 36:18.524
When you need to repent,
you go to church.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.613
Contrition by mosh pit.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.789
Yeah, something like that.[grunts]

36:22.832 --> 36:24.356
[chuckles]

36:24.399 --> 36:26.880
You know you don't got to
be so hard on yourself?

36:26.923 --> 36:28.447
Oh, you're kidding me.

36:28.490 --> 36:31.493
You were just trying to help."I was just trying to help."

36:31.537 --> 36:33.800
Like Brutus.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.454
You know what
your problem is?

36:35.497 --> 36:36.977
I'm a liar.Mm-hmm.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.893
I'm a lying liar who lies.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.808
Yeah, you don't know
how to forgive.

36:41.851 --> 36:43.288
I know how to forgive.

36:43.331 --> 36:45.115
I'm not talking about
other people, Sarah.

36:45.159 --> 36:48.510
I'm talking about you
forgiving yourself.

36:48.554 --> 36:51.165
Grover,

36:51.209 --> 36:52.384
I hurt the people
in the world

36:52.427 --> 36:53.994
that I'm supposed
to care the most about.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.387
What do you want me to do?

36:55.430 --> 36:57.780
I want you to remember
that you are human.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.347
I want you to remember

36:59.391 --> 37:01.175
that you've spent
your whole life

37:01.219 --> 37:04.483
worrying about everyone
in this town but yourself.

37:04.526 --> 37:08.443
And I'm not talking about
this leadership thing.

37:09.792 --> 37:13.709
I'm talking about
your friends, Sarah.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.190
We need you to
forgive yourself.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.322
Why?

37:17.365 --> 37:20.803
AJ slept with a
married woman.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.023
Danny cheated
on his fiancÃ©e.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.634
Corinne cheated
on her husband.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.201
They've all made mistakes,

37:27.245 --> 37:29.247
and they're terrified
that those mistakes

37:29.290 --> 37:31.684
are going to
swallow them whole.

37:31.727 --> 37:34.600
Now, if you can do what you
did and come back from it,

37:34.643 --> 37:37.211
maybe, just maybe,

37:37.255 --> 37:39.909
there's hope for the
rest of us. [chuckles]

37:40.736 --> 37:43.478
You're our North Star.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.787
You always have been.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.008
You didn't ask
for this, to be...

37:52.052 --> 37:53.967
to be this person
for everyone.

37:54.750 --> 37:59.277
Those that keep the wolves
at bay always get bitten.

38:00.321 --> 38:01.931
But hey.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.673
If you're still bleeding,

38:04.717 --> 38:07.285
you're still breathing.

["If You Went Away"

38:20.385 --> 38:22.082
[exhales]
Hi.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.605
Adam and Josh are...

38:23.649 --> 38:25.172
They're coming home
this morning, so you should go.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.000
I will,
but I'm not gonna go far.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.523
What does that mean?

38:28.567 --> 38:30.046
It means I'm staying in Greylock

38:30.090 --> 38:33.398
for the foreseeable future.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.400
I appreciate your help
with the custody case,

38:35.443 --> 38:37.750
but that doesn't mean
that we can just...I'm staying

38:37.793 --> 38:39.099
for Josh.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.840
I'd like to get
to know him,

38:40.883 --> 38:42.058
if that's okay.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.585
Things are gonna be really
complicated with our new normal.

38:46.628 --> 38:47.934
â™ª Listen here, listen close...

38:47.977 --> 38:50.502
What is your new normal?

38:50.545 --> 38:53.896
Adam and I are staying in
this house in separate bedrooms

38:53.940 --> 38:56.116
until we can explain everything
to Josh.

38:56.159 --> 38:58.292
It is gonna be
really hard on him.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.859
I don't want to make it harder
by adding a third parent

38:59.902 --> 39:01.121
to the equation.I get it.

39:01.164 --> 39:03.297
I'll wait
as long as you want me to.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.864
â™ª Kept the ones
who lost control... â™ª

39:04.907 --> 39:06.909
Look,

39:06.953 --> 39:10.391
Danny, if you stay,

39:10.435 --> 39:13.394
if you decide
to become a part of Josh's life,

39:13.438 --> 39:16.441
you can't abandon him
like you abandoned me.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.094
If you're gonna be in,
you have to be all in.

39:18.138 --> 39:19.705
I'm not going anywhere, Corinne.

39:19.748 --> 39:22.185
â™ª And if you went away,
you went away... â™ª

39:22.229 --> 39:25.450
Sarah helped me to realize
that it's time to stop running.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.713
So...

39:27.756 --> 39:30.019
here I am.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.112

39:38.376 --> 39:40.378

39:41.814 --> 39:44.425
Yeah.So did I.

Yeah?Yeah.

â™ª Your leaving could be the
best thing to do for yourself â™ª

40:05.054 --> 40:09.450
â™ª But selfishly I shove
you out, demanding your help â™ª

40:09.494 --> 40:13.062
â™ª You're leaving, never look
back, and I won't call again â™ª

40:13.106 --> 40:16.022

went away â™ª
