00:36.035 --> 00:36.403
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.403 --> 00:37.270
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.104
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.806
THE ICC PUT OUT A WARRANT FOR

00:52.252 --> 00:54.120
THIS VIDEO "HE RELEASED,"

00:54.120 --> 00:55.288
DIRECTED TOWARD FARMERS, IT

00:55.288 --> 00:56.823
SEEMS LIKE HE'S DOING GREAT.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.826
I MADE FARMERS HAPPY AND RICH

00:59.826 --> 01:01.961
AGAIN, AND THEY'RE DOING A

01:01.961 --> 01:03.396
FANTASTIC JOB, AND YOU KNOW

01:03.396 --> 01:05.865
WHAT?

01:05.865 --> 01:07.500
SOMEDAY, IT'LL BECOME TIME FOR

01:07.500 --> 01:11.738
THEM TO LEAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL

01:11.738 --> 01:14.507
EARTH, AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

01:14.507 --> 01:16.009
LEAVE THEIR FARM WITHOUT TAXES,

01:16.009 --> 01:18.077
TO THEIR CHILDREN.

01:18.077 --> 01:20.947
I GOT RID OF THE DEATH TAX ON

01:20.947 --> 01:22.782
FARMS SO THAT WHEN YOU DO PASS

01:22.782 --> 01:24.851
AWAY ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU

01:24.851 --> 01:27.787
LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, YOU CAN

01:27.787 --> 01:28.822
LEAVE IT TO THEM AND THEY WON'T

01:28.822 --> 01:30.723
HAVE TO PAY TAX.

01:30.723 --> 01:32.725
BUT IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR

01:32.725 --> 01:33.793
CHILDREN SO MUCH AND THERE ARE

01:33.793 --> 01:37.030
SOME PEOPLE THAT DON'T, AND

01:37.030 --> 01:38.765
MAYBE DESERVEDLY SO, IT WON'T

01:38.765 --> 01:39.899
MATTER BECAUSE FRANKLY, YOU

01:39.899 --> 01:41.000
DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THEM

ANYTHING.

01:41.701 --> 01:42.435
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:47.006 --> 01:47.440
John: I MEAN.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.708
HE'S STILL GOT IT!

01:48.708 --> 01:53.313
AND BY IT, I MEAN WHATEVER IT IS

01:53.313 --> 01:54.614
THAT'S SO DEEPLY WRONG WITH HIS

01:54.614 --> 01:54.948
BRAIN.

01:54.948 --> 01:55.715
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TO

01:55.715 --> 01:57.050
HATE YOUR KIDS TO GET DISTRACTED

01:57.050 --> 01:57.817
BY THAT THOUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:57.817 --> 01:58.218
A POLITICAL SPEECH?

01:58.218 --> 01:59.586
"WE SHOULD HAVE PULLED OUT

01:59.586 --> 02:01.354
TROOPS FROM THE REGION SOONER.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.826
AND THEY SHOT THAT WITH TWO

02:06.826 --> 02:08.094
CAMERAS!

02:08.094 --> 02:10.463
THEY CUT SOMETHING OUT THERE,

02:10.463 --> 02:12.098
AND GIVEN WHAT THEY KEPT IN, I'M

02:12.098 --> 02:15.235
DYING TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.703
AND THEN TO STICK THE LANDING

02:16.703 --> 02:17.303
WITH "HAVE FUN?"

02:17.303 --> 02:20.740
IT'S IMPECCABLE.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.307
IT'S ALL JUST IMPECCABLE.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.609
BUT THIS WEEK'S BEEN DOMINATED

02:22.609 --> 02:23.843
BY THE CONTINUING FALLOUT OF THE

02:23.843 --> 02:25.712
COLLAPSE OF SILICON VALLEY BANK.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.146
EARLY MONDAY, BIDEN SPOKE OUT TO

02:27.146 --> 02:28.581
TRY AND STEM ANY PANIC.

02:28.581 --> 02:29.816
PRESIDENT BIDEN SOUGHT TO

02:29.816 --> 02:31.317
ASSURE THE COUNTRY BEFORE

02:31.317 --> 02:32.118
MARKETS OPENED THIS MORNING.

02:32.118 --> 02:35.088
AMERICANS CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE

02:35.088 --> 02:36.122
THAT THE BANKING SYSTEM IS SAFE.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.824
THE NEWS IS WELCOME RELIEF

02:37.824 --> 02:39.392
FOR BEN KAUFMAN, FOUNDER AND CEO

02:39.392 --> 02:41.194
OF KIDS' STORE CAMP.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.263
MOST OF HIS COMPANY'S MONEY WAS

02:43.263 --> 02:44.697
IN SVB WHEN THE BANK WENT UNDER.

02:44.697 --> 02:46.366
DESPERATE TO RAISE CASH, HIS

02:46.366 --> 02:48.735
COMPANY SLASHED PRICES BY 40%.

02:48.735 --> 02:49.602
WE SENT OUT AN EMAIL WITH A

02:49.602 --> 02:50.904
DISCOUNT CODE.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.705
THE CODE WAS "BANK RUN."

02:52.705 --> 02:54.240
John: OKAY, I SEE WHAT HE'S

02:54.240 --> 02:54.574
DOING THERE.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.175
BUT IF YOU WEREN'T FOLLOWING THE

02:56.175 --> 02:58.411
NEWS, GETTING AN EMAIL WITH THE

02:58.411 --> 02:59.646
DISCOUNT CODE "BANK RUN" IS

02:59.646 --> 03:00.513
PRETTY ALARMING.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.514
"HEY, HONEY, REMEMBER THAT

03:08.821 --> 03:15.795
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?"

03:15.795 --> 03:16.429
DO WE NEED TO TURN ON THE NEWS?

03:16.429 --> 03:17.063
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN A BUNCH OF

03:17.063 --> 03:17.697
EXPLAINERS THIS WEEK, SO I WON'T

03:17.697 --> 03:18.431
BORE YOU WITH EVERY LITTLE

03:18.431 --> 03:18.798
DETAIL.

03:18.798 --> 03:19.399
BUT BROADLY SPEAKING, SVB HAD

03:19.399 --> 03:20.133
INVESTED A LOT OF ITS CUSTOMERS'

03:20.133 --> 03:20.700
MONEY IN LONG-TERM TREASURY

03:20.700 --> 03:22.368
BONDS.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.570
BUT AS THE FED SHARPLY RAISED

03:23.570 --> 03:24.437
INTEREST RATES, THOSE BONDS LOST

03:24.437 --> 03:25.672
VALUE.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.073
AND WHEN THE BANK SOLD A LOT OF

03:27.073 --> 03:29.108
ITS SECURITIES AT A HUGE LOSS,

03:29.108 --> 03:30.209
ITS CUSTOMERS PANICKED, AND

03:30.209 --> 03:31.210
THERE WAS A STAMPEDE FOR THE

03:31.210 --> 03:31.911
EXITS.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.479
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A CLASSIC STORY

03:33.479 --> 03:35.882
OF A BANK DOING A LOUSY JOB OF

03:35.882 --> 03:38.084
JUDGING AND HEDGING AGAINST

03:38.084 --> 03:40.787
RISKS.

03:40.787 --> 03:43.122
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU'RE FOX NEWS,

03:43.122 --> 03:43.723
THERE IS ANOTHER EXPLANATION.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.357
SILICON VALLEY BANK IS A WOKE

03:44.357 --> 03:44.657
BIDEN BANK.

03:44.657 --> 03:45.992
NOW, SVB WAS CALIFORNIA'S

03:45.992 --> 03:47.927
WOKE, TRENDY BANK.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.462
HERE'S MY CONCERN, THIS IS A

03:49.462 --> 03:50.697
WOKE BANK.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.265
DID SILICON VALLEY BANK GET

03:52.265 --> 03:54.467
WOKE AND GO BROKE?

03:54.467 --> 03:55.134
John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

03:55.134 --> 03:58.338
ABOUT?

03:58.338 --> 03:58.905
THAT IS SO STUPID I'M ALMOST

03:58.905 --> 03:59.706
JEALOUS.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.240
BECAUSE IT MUST BE SO NICE FOR

04:01.240 --> 04:02.609
THEM, TO BE ABLE TO

04:02.609 --> 04:04.410
AUTOMATICALLY BLAME EVERYTHING

04:04.410 --> 04:05.044
THEY DON'T LIKE OR UNDERSTAND ON

04:05.044 --> 04:06.179
WOKENESS.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.513
"IT RAINED ON MY BIRTHDAY

04:07.513 --> 04:09.115
BECAUSE OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY

04:09.115 --> 04:10.283
AND MY SON CALLED ME A BITCH

04:10.283 --> 04:12.285
BECAUSE OF SOCIALISM, AND ON TOP

04:12.285 --> 04:13.586
OF ALL THAT, I WAS LATE TO WORK

04:13.586 --> 04:14.787
BECAUSE OF A BUNCH OF PRONOUNS.

04:14.787 --> 04:18.024
I BELIEVE THESE THINGS MIND BODY

04:18.024 --> 04:18.958
SOUL AND IT MAKES MY LIFE

04:18.958 --> 04:20.426
MONUMENTALLY EASIER."

04:20.426 --> 04:21.861
AND THE FULL CONTEXT FOR THE

04:21.861 --> 04:23.396
"WOKE BANK" NARRATIVE IS SOMEHOW

04:23.396 --> 04:25.665
EVEN DUMBER THAN YOU THINK.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.100
BASICALLY, FOX GRABBED ONTO SOME

04:27.100 --> 04:28.635
OF SVB'S DIVERSITY INITIATIVES,

04:28.635 --> 04:30.303
AND TRIED TO SPIN THOSE INTO THE

04:30.303 --> 04:31.638
REASON FOR THE COLLAPSE, EVEN

04:31.638 --> 04:33.473
THOUGH, AS ONE EXPERT IN

04:33.473 --> 04:34.607
CONSUMER FINANCE POINTED OUT.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.376
"IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,"

04:36.376 --> 04:37.977
ADDING THAT TRYING TO TIE THE

04:37.977 --> 04:40.146
TWO TOGETHER IS LIKE SAYING,

04:40.146 --> 04:41.547
"WHY ISN'T BLUE THE ANSWER TO 1

04:41.547 --> 04:42.915
PLUS 1?

04:42.915 --> 04:44.350
IT'S BANKING 101.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.052
THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON."

04:46.052 --> 04:47.820
AND OF COURSE!

04:47.820 --> 04:50.089
HEDGING AGAINST RISK IS A

04:50.089 --> 04:51.691
FOUNDATIONAL LESSON OF BANKING,

04:51.691 --> 04:53.092
ALONG WITH "BUY LOW, SELL HIGH"

04:53.092 --> 04:54.460
AND "WEAR A FANCY SUIT AND TIE

04:54.460 --> 04:55.561
SO NO ONE CAN TELL YOU HAVE NO

04:55.561 --> 04:56.095
IDEA WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE

04:56.095 --> 04:58.564
DOING."

04:58.564 --> 04:59.866
AND TO BE HONEST, THAT ONE IS

04:59.866 --> 05:02.035
STILL PRETTY HANDY.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.069
AND LOOK, WE'LL UNDOUBTEDLY

07:10.062 --> 07:11.898
GENEROUS LOVER."

07:11.898 --> 07:14.033
FLAVORTOWN IS A STATE OF MIND,

07:14.033 --> 07:15.601
AND HE'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET

07:15.601 --> 07:17.670
THERE.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.205
AND IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN THAT

07:19.205 --> 07:20.506
AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER

07:20.506 --> 07:22.041
THE FED WAS DERELICT IN

07:22.041 --> 07:22.909
OVERSEEING SVB HAS BEEN

07:22.909 --> 07:23.843
ENTRUSTED TO...

07:23.843 --> 07:25.344
THE FED.

07:25.344 --> 07:26.612
LOOK, OVERALL, IT SEEMS LIKE THE

07:26.612 --> 07:28.014
PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING OUR

07:28.014 --> 07:32.084
ECONOMY SAFE WILL JUST KEEP

07:32.084 --> 07:33.486
TELLING US, "TRUST US, WE CAN

07:33.486 --> 07:34.720
POLICE OURSELVES, NOTHING WILL

07:34.720 --> 07:35.188
GO WRONG."

07:35.188 --> 07:36.155
BUT IF I MAY QUOTE A FORMER

07:36.155 --> 07:37.490
LEADING MAN CURRENTLY LOOKING

07:37.490 --> 07:41.294
FOR WORK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.628
THIS TIME, I THINK YOU MIGHT

07:42.628 --> 07:44.063
ACTUALLY BE RIGHT.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.531
AND NOW THIS.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.200
Announcer: AND NOW,

07:47.200 --> 07:51.170
FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY, LOCAL

07:51.170 --> 07:53.172
NEWS DID WHAT THEY ALWAYS

07:53.172 --> 07:54.874
FUCKING DO.

07:54.874 --> 08:03.015
WELL, TOP OF THE MORNING,

08:03.015 --> 08:04.283
WELCOME TO THIS IRISH EDITION.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.117
I'M NOT DOING AN ACCENT.

08:05.117 --> 08:05.918
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.

08:05.918 --> 08:09.388
FINE IRISH DAY.

08:09.388 --> 08:15.228
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.597
ST. PADDY'S DAY, TOP OF THE

08:17.597 --> 08:18.231
MORNING TO YOU.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.498
TOP OF THE MORNING.

08:19.498 --> 08:20.032
YOU DIDN'T INSULT A SINGLE

08:20.032 --> 08:21.200
PERSON.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.003
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.

08:24.003 --> 08:28.541
CAN YOU DO AN IRISH ACCENT?

08:28.541 --> 08:30.543
I HAVE NO CLUE.

08:30.543 --> 08:31.911
THAT WAS NOT A VERY GOOD

08:31.911 --> 08:32.745
ST. PADDY'S DAY ACCENT.

08:32.745 --> 08:33.779
GREEN HELPS YOU BECOME

08:33.779 --> 08:41.587
INVISIBLE TO LEPRECHAUNS.

08:41.587 --> 08:42.221
TOO TALL TO BE A LEPRECHAUN.

08:42.221 --> 08:42.755
HE'S GOT HIS FISHERMAN

08:42.755 --> 08:43.055
SWEATER ON.

08:43.055 --> 08:43.656
THE LORE BEHIND THE FISHERMAN

08:43.656 --> 08:43.890
SWEATER.

08:43.890 --> 08:44.190
TELL ME.

08:44.190 --> 08:44.824
WHEN THE SEAMEN WOULD GO OUT,

08:44.824 --> 08:46.158
THEY WOULD WEAR UNFORTUNATELY,

08:46.158 --> 08:49.829
SOME OF THEM WOULDN'T COME BACK,

08:49.829 --> 08:51.130
THEY COME BACK-- THE SHIPS

08:51.130 --> 08:52.231
WOULD SINK LIKE THAT AND THE

08:52.231 --> 08:54.000
BODIES WOULD WASH UP AND THEY'D

08:54.000 --> 08:55.301
BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE FAMILY

08:55.301 --> 09:00.740
BY THE KIND OF SWEATER.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.207
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

09:01.207 --> 09:01.674
THAT'S FROM WHAT I

09:01.674 --> 09:05.177
UNDERSTAND.

09:05.177 --> 09:09.482
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.416
TOP OF THE MORNING.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.418
John: MOVING ON.

09:12.418 --> 09:12.952
WITH IT BEING SPRING BREAK

09:12.952 --> 09:14.353
SEASON, OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

09:14.353 --> 09:15.321
CONCERNS VACATIONS.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.622
A WONDERFUL TIME TO REALIZE

09:16.622 --> 09:17.990
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE, OR

09:17.990 --> 09:19.625
REALIZE THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

09:19.625 --> 09:21.060
NOT.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.328
AND BE HONEST, YOU KNEW IN THE

09:22.328 --> 09:23.763
TSA LINE BEFORE THE FLIGHT.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.131
KEEP THE STREAMING PASSWORDS FOR

09:25.131 --> 09:27.266
AS LONG AS YOU CAN BUT DO GIVE

09:27.266 --> 09:29.902
BACK HIS GRANDMOTHER'S RING.

09:29.902 --> 09:30.469
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

09:30.469 --> 09:30.937
TALK ABOUT TIMESHARES.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.305
AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE

09:32.305 --> 09:33.606
THINKING, "WAIT, ARE YOU GOING

09:33.606 --> 09:34.907
TO TELL ME THEY'RE A SCAM?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.342
BECAUSE SURELY EVERYONE KNOWS

09:36.342 --> 09:37.977
THAT."

09:37.977 --> 09:38.744
AND IT IS TRUE THAT THE

09:38.744 --> 09:39.812
SKETCHINESS OF TIMESHARE

09:39.812 --> 09:41.914
VACATIONS HAS BEEN A PUNCHLINE

09:41.914 --> 09:42.848
ON TV FOR YEARS.

09:42.848 --> 09:43.816
YOU MORON, THESE AREN'T FREE

09:43.816 --> 09:44.951
VACATIONS.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.352
THESE ARE TIMESHARING DEALS,

09:46.352 --> 09:47.720
THEY'RE TOTAL SCAMS.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.721
THESE TIMESHARE PEOPLE, THEY

09:48.721 --> 09:49.655
DON'T STOP UNTIL THEY SELL YOU

09:49.655 --> 09:51.090
SOMETHING.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.291
THEY-- THEY PREY ON THE WEAK

09:52.291 --> 09:53.192
AND GULLIBLE.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.660
I.E. YOU!

09:54.660 --> 09:55.761
PERHAPS YOU AND YOUR YELLOW

09:55.761 --> 09:58.431
FRIEND WOULD LIKE TO SET UP A

09:58.431 --> 09:59.165
TIMESHARE PLAN?

09:59.165 --> 10:00.866
DON'T DO IT, SANDY!

10:00.866 --> 10:02.101
I WON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR

10:02.101 --> 10:04.303
TIMESHARE VACATION SCAM!

10:04.303 --> 10:05.771
John: YEAH, SUSPICIONS ABOUT

10:05.771 --> 10:07.807
TIMESHARE PROGRAMS ARE SO

10:07.807 --> 10:09.375
UBIQUITOUS THEY CAN GET LAUGHS

10:09.375 --> 10:10.876
IN CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.044
AND LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, SPONGEBOB

10:12.044 --> 10:13.646
WAS NEVER GOING TO SAY YES TO A

10:13.646 --> 10:14.413
TIMESHARE.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.948
OTHERWISE THEY'D HAVE HAD TO

10:15.948 --> 10:16.983
CHANGE HIS THEME SONG TO THIS.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.885

10:19.885 --> 10:21.287

John: YEAH, STILL GOOD, BUT

10:28.594 --> 10:29.462
IT DOESN'T QUITE HAVE THE SAME

10:29.462 --> 10:31.130
RING TO IT, DOES IT?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.531
BUT DESPITE DECADES OF MOCKERY

10:32.531 --> 10:34.300
ON TV, TIMESHARES ARE A MUCH

10:34.300 --> 10:35.468
BIGGER BUSINESS THAN YOU MAY

10:35.468 --> 10:36.936
THINK.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.038
THEY'RE ACTUALLY AN $8.1 BILLION

10:39.038 --> 10:41.307
DOLLAR INDUSTRY, WITH NEARLY TEN

10:41.307 --> 10:42.341
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS OWNING ONE OR

10:42.341 --> 10:44.143
MORE TYPES OF TIMESHARE.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.845
AND THEY CAN BE SOLD BY BIG

10:45.845 --> 10:47.213
HOTEL CHAINS LIKE HYATT, AND

10:47.213 --> 10:48.581
MARRIOTT, AS WELL AS COMPANIES

10:48.581 --> 10:49.115
LIKE WYNDHAM AND WESTGATE

10:49.115 --> 10:51.283
RESORTS.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.752
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

10:52.752 --> 10:53.886
MAY'VE OBSCURED THEIR CONTINUED

10:53.886 --> 10:55.154
GROWTH IS THAT THEY'RE NOT

10:55.154 --> 10:56.822
ALWAYS CALLED TIMESHARES.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.324
IN RECENT YEARS, THEY'VE BEEN

10:58.324 --> 10:59.825
RE-BRANDED AS "VACATION CLUBS"

10:59.825 --> 11:01.861
OR "VACATION OWNERSHIP PLANS."

11:01.861 --> 11:03.229
AND WHILE, TRADITIONALLY, YOU'D

11:03.229 --> 11:05.965
BUY A TIMESHARE THAT CONSISTED

11:05.965 --> 11:06.832
OF ONE WEEK EVERY YEAR AT, SAY A

11:06.832 --> 11:09.001
CONDO IN FLORIDA, NOWADAYS,

11:09.001 --> 11:10.202
COMPANIES OFFER "FLOATING WEEKS"

11:10.202 --> 11:12.271
THAT CAN THEORETICALLY BE USED

11:12.271 --> 11:13.439
ANYTIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR--

11:13.439 --> 11:14.673
OR "TIMESHARE POINTS," WHERE YOU

11:14.673 --> 11:16.375
BUY POINTS THAT YOU CAN REDEEM

11:16.375 --> 11:18.677
IN A NUMBER OF RESORT PROPERTIES

11:18.677 --> 11:19.378
OWNED BY THE SAME COMPANY.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.147
BUT WHATEVER YOU CALL

11:21.147 --> 11:22.548
TIMESHARES, THE PEOPLE SELLING

11:22.548 --> 11:24.050
THEM MAINTAIN THAT THEY'RE NOT

11:24.050 --> 11:25.451
JUST EXCELLENT VALUE-- THEY'RE

11:25.451 --> 11:26.685
ACTIVELY GOOD FOR YOU.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.354
HERE'S A VICE PRESIDENT AT

11:28.354 --> 11:30.022
WESTGATE, FIRING UP HIS SALES

11:30.022 --> 11:30.623
TEAM, IN THE WEIRDEST POSSIBLE

11:30.623 --> 11:32.625
WAY.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.093
WHY ARE WE HERE?

11:34.093 --> 11:35.561
TO SAVE LIVES!

11:35.561 --> 11:37.263
TO SAVE LIVES.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.932
THOSE WHO TAKE THE FEWEST AMOUNT

11:39.932 --> 11:41.000
OF VACATIONS ARE MOST LIKELY TO

11:41.000 --> 11:43.335
HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.037
YOU'RE JUST LIKE A DOCTOR, A

11:45.037 --> 11:48.140
NURSE, A FIREMAN, POLICEMAN, A

11:48.140 --> 11:51.710
LIFEGUARD.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.379
THEY ALL SAVE LIVES AND YOU ALL

11:53.379 --> 11:58.284
DO IT, TOO.

11:58.284 --> 11:58.918
John: YOU'RE RIGHT, TIMESHARE

11:58.918 --> 11:59.585
SALESPEOPLE SAVE LIVES JUST LIKE

11:59.585 --> 12:00.886
DOCTORS AND NURSES!

12:00.886 --> 12:02.054
THAT'S WHY, DURING THE INITIAL

12:02.054 --> 12:03.689
OUTBREAK OF THE PANDEMIC, NEW

12:03.689 --> 12:05.157
YORKERS WOULD LOUDLY CHEER FOR

12:05.157 --> 12:07.426
ALL THE TIMESHARE SALESPEOPLE AS

12:07.426 --> 12:09.495
THEY CAME BACK FROM WORK.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.329
WE'D DO THAT AT 6:00 P.M., AND

12:10.329 --> 12:11.530
THEN IF WE STILL HAD SOME ENERGY

12:11.530 --> 12:12.731
LEFT, WE'D THROW A FEW CLAPS TO

12:12.731 --> 12:13.666
HOSPITAL WORKERS AT 7, FOR

12:13.666 --> 12:15.434
WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.369
BUT THE FACT IS, TIMESHARES

12:17.369 --> 12:18.637
DON'T SAVE LIVES.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.139
IN FACT, IN MANY CASES, THEY CAN

12:20.139 --> 12:21.674
FUCK THEM UP.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.509
BECAUSE THEY'RE INCREDIBLY EASY

12:23.509 --> 12:24.810
TO GET INTO, BUT-- AS YOU'LL

12:24.810 --> 12:25.644
SEE-- INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET

12:25.644 --> 12:27.546
OUT OF.

12:27.546 --> 12:28.681
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

12:28.681 --> 12:29.448
TIMESHARES.

12:29.448 --> 12:30.583
AND LET'S START WITH THE FIRST

12:30.583 --> 12:31.484
THING YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW

12:31.484 --> 12:32.318
ABOUT THEM.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.053
THAT THEY TEND TO BE SOLD

12:34.053 --> 12:35.421
IN-PERSON, AGGRESSIVELY, AND

12:35.421 --> 12:37.123
WHILE YOU'RE ALREADY ON

12:37.123 --> 12:38.457
VACATION, OFTEN BY SUCKERING

12:38.457 --> 12:39.558
PEOPLE IN TO AGONIZINGLY LONG

12:39.558 --> 12:40.860
SALES PRESENTATIONS WITH THE

12:40.860 --> 12:42.628
PROMISE OF A FREE GIFT.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.430
THERE ARE SO MANY HORROR STORIES

12:44.430 --> 12:45.865
OUT THERE, LIKE THE WOMAN WHOSE

12:45.865 --> 12:48.134
HER PARENTS WERE SUBJECTED TO A

12:48.134 --> 12:49.235
SEVEN-HOUR SALES PITCH THAT

12:49.235 --> 12:50.636
ENDED WITH THEM SPENDING MORE

12:50.636 --> 12:52.404
THAN $10,000 ON A TIMESHARE, OR

12:52.404 --> 12:53.839
THE PERSON WHO SIGNED AN

12:53.839 --> 12:55.508
AGREEMENT FOLLOWING A 5 HOUR

12:55.508 --> 12:57.009
PRESENTATION, BECAUSE, QUOTE,

12:57.009 --> 12:57.877
"I'M A DIABETIC.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.245
AFTER FIVE HOURS, I JUST GAVE

12:59.245 --> 13:00.513
IN.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.814
I NEEDED SOMETHING TO EAT."

13:01.814 --> 13:04.250
AND I GET THAT.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.151
"LISTEN TO A TIMESHARE

13:05.151 --> 13:06.285
PRESENTATION" IS DEAD LAST ON

13:06.285 --> 13:08.187
THE LIST OF THINGS I WANT TO DO

13:08.187 --> 13:10.055
FOR FIVE HOURS STRAIGHT, RIGHT

13:10.055 --> 13:11.457
AFTER "WATCHING AVATAR: THE WAY

13:11.457 --> 13:13.926
OF WATER," "TELLING CHILDREN

13:13.926 --> 13:14.894
THAT THEIR PET HAMSTER WAS EATEN

13:14.894 --> 13:17.596
BY THEIR OTHER PET HAMSTER AND

13:17.596 --> 13:18.764
THAT NEITHER ONE EVER KNEW THE

13:18.764 --> 13:20.032
CHILD IN QUESTION EXISTED," AND,

13:20.032 --> 13:22.234
OF COURSE, "HEARING OTHER PEOPLE

13:22.234 --> 13:22.868
TALK ABOUT WATCHING AVATAR: THE

13:22.868 --> 13:25.371
WAY OF WATER."

13:25.371 --> 13:26.872
THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH, ONCE

13:26.872 --> 13:28.307
YOU'RE IN THAT ROOM, COMPANIES

13:28.307 --> 13:30.509
CAN GO TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO GET

13:30.509 --> 13:31.644
YOU TO COMMIT ON THE SPOT.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.879
JUST WATCH AS THAT WESTGATE

13:33.879 --> 13:34.980
EXECUTIVE ENCOURAGES HIS STAFF

13:34.980 --> 13:36.248
TO STOP AT NOTHING TO MAKE A

13:36.248 --> 13:37.716
SALE.

13:37.716 --> 13:38.884
OUR NUMBER ONE PERSON IN

13:38.884 --> 13:39.852
ORLANDO OWNS SEVERAL WEEKS OF

13:39.852 --> 13:41.220
TIMESHARE.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.154
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD OWN AT

13:42.154 --> 13:44.190
LEAST ONE WEEK YOURSELVES.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.392
AND IF YOU DON'T, LIE AND SAY

13:46.392 --> 13:47.159
YOU DO!

13:47.159 --> 13:49.228
[LAUGHTER]

13:49.228 --> 13:50.729
DON'T LET THESE PEOPLE LEAVE

13:50.729 --> 13:54.233
HERE WITHOUT BUYING SOMETHING.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.834
SOMETHING.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.902
John: I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

13:56.902 --> 13:57.870
MORE ALARMING THERE.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.772
THAT HE KNEW A CAMERA CREW WAS

13:59.772 --> 14:01.073
FILMING, AND STILL INSTRUCTED

14:01.073 --> 14:02.775
HIS SALES TEAM TO LIE, OR THAT

14:02.775 --> 14:06.712
HE WILLINGLY WORE THAT SHIRT.

14:06.712 --> 14:07.680
BECAUSE WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT

14:07.680 --> 14:09.081
THING?

14:09.081 --> 14:10.115
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE ATE A

14:10.115 --> 14:11.350
PERSIAN RUG AND THEN THREW UP ON

14:11.350 --> 14:12.351
HIM.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.786
HE LOOKS LIKE THE MASCOT FOR

14:13.786 --> 14:16.355
DIVORCE.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.690
LYING IS ACTUALLY A KEY STRATEGY

14:17.690 --> 14:19.758
FOR MANY TIMESHARE SALESPEOPLE.

14:19.758 --> 14:21.927
THEY WILL LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING,

14:21.927 --> 14:22.995
FROM THE EASE OF MAKING

14:22.995 --> 14:23.629
RESERVATIONS, TO THE TOTAL COST

14:23.629 --> 14:25.464
OF THE TIMESHARE.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.733
ACCORDING TO A LAWSUIT AGAINST

14:27.733 --> 14:29.335
WYNDHAM, SALESPEOPLE EVEN HAD AN

14:29.335 --> 14:30.769
ACRONYM, "TAFT," WHICH STOOD FOR

14:30.769 --> 14:33.572
"TELL THEM ANY FRIGGING THING."

14:33.572 --> 14:40.012
AND COME ON!

14:40.012 --> 14:41.213
AT THIS POINT JUST SAY

14:41.213 --> 14:41.747
"FUCKING."

14:41.747 --> 14:42.314
IT'S ONE THING TO LIE, IT'S

14:42.314 --> 14:43.849
ANOTHER TO DO THAT WHILE TALKING

14:43.849 --> 14:44.483
LIKE A MIDDLE SCHOOLER WHO'S IN

14:44.483 --> 14:45.117
THE CAR WITH THEIR MOM BUT STILL

14:45.117 --> 14:45.918
TRYING TO SOUND HARD.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.286
BUT THE THING IS, LYING IS

14:47.286 --> 14:47.953
BASICALLY ALLOWED IN THIS

14:47.953 --> 14:49.088
INDUSTRY.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.289
MANY TIMESHARE AGREEMENTS

14:50.289 --> 14:52.157
CONTAIN A CLAUSE THAT ABSOLVES

14:52.157 --> 14:53.392
THE DEVELOPER FROM

14:53.392 --> 14:57.463
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING

14:57.463 --> 14:58.764
SALES REPS SAY.

14:58.764 --> 14:59.298
IT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO BY

14:59.298 --> 14:59.865
ATTORNEYS AS THE "SALESMAN'S

14:59.865 --> 15:02.134
LICENSE TO LIE CLAUSE."

15:02.134 --> 15:04.036
AND I GET THAT SALES REPS

15:04.036 --> 15:05.004
BULLSHIT CUSTOMERS CONSTANTLY.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.472
IT HAPPENS TO ME EVERY TIME A

15:06.472 --> 15:07.773
WARBY PARKER EMPLOYEE TELLS ME

15:07.773 --> 15:09.808
"YOU LOOK SO COOL!"

15:09.808 --> 15:11.377
BUT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO

15:11.377 --> 15:13.112
BE ABLE TO LIE ABOUT SOMETHING

15:13.112 --> 15:14.146
AS OBJECTIVE AS "HOW MUCH A

15:14.146 --> 15:16.081
THING WILL COST."

15:16.081 --> 15:17.216
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, DEPENDING

15:17.216 --> 15:18.617
ON WHERE YOU MADE YOUR PURCHASE,

15:18.617 --> 15:19.952
YOU CAN HAVE BETWEEN 3 AND 10

15:19.952 --> 15:22.788
DAYS TO RESCIND YOUR SIGNATURE.

15:22.788 --> 15:23.656
BUT REMEMBER, A LOT OF PEOPLE

15:23.656 --> 15:25.324
SIGN UP FOR TIMESHARES ON

15:25.324 --> 15:27.092
VACATION.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.361
SO THAT TIME MAY EXPIRE BEFORE

15:29.361 --> 15:30.996
THEY GET HOME, OR HAVE A CHANCE

15:30.996 --> 15:31.897
TO HAVE A LAWYER LOOK AT THE

15:31.897 --> 15:33.132
CONTRACT.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.700
AND THIS'D BE LESS OF AN ISSUE

15:34.700 --> 15:35.334
IF PEOPLE GENERALLY LOVED THEIR

15:35.334 --> 15:36.702
TIMESHARES.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.871
BUT A STUDY FOUND THAT 85% OF

15:38.871 --> 15:41.674
TIMESHARE OWNERS REGRET THEIR

15:41.674 --> 15:42.374
PURCHASE.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.776
WHICH IS A RATE OF REGRET ON PAR

15:43.776 --> 15:46.278
WITH "PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT TEACUP

15:46.278 --> 15:47.479
PIGS ONLY TO REALIZE THAT TEACUP

15:47.479 --> 15:49.581
PIGS DON'T REALLY EXIST.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.784
WHAT DO EXIST ARE BABY PIGS THAT

15:51.784 --> 15:54.019
GROW INTO A 90-POUND PIECE OF

15:54.019 --> 15:56.455
LIVESTOCK THAT SUFFOCATES YOUR

15:56.455 --> 15:58.290
CAT."

15:58.290 --> 15:59.625
AND AT THIS POINT, LET'S TALK

15:59.625 --> 16:00.993
ABOUT WHY PEOPLE MIGHT REGRET

16:00.993 --> 16:02.761
BUYING A TIMESHARE.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.163
AND THE FIRST MAJOR REASON,

16:04.163 --> 16:05.531
UNSURPRISINGLY, IS COST.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.833
BECAUSE THE UPFRONT COST FOR A

16:07.833 --> 16:08.934
ONE-WEEK ANNUAL TIMESHARE

16:08.934 --> 16:10.869
VACATION CAN AVERAGE AROUND

16:10.869 --> 16:12.171
$24,000.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.939
BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.974
BECAUSE ON TOP OF THAT COME

16:15.974 --> 16:16.608
OTHER EXPENSES LIKE "MAINTENANCE

16:16.608 --> 16:19.712
FEES," WHICH TYPICALLY GO UP

16:19.712 --> 16:21.180
EVERY YEAR, AND AT HIGH-VALUE

16:21.180 --> 16:22.748
RESORTS, CAN RUN FROM $2500 TO

16:22.748 --> 16:25.584
$3500 PER YEAR.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.019
AND YOU'RE ON THE HOOK FOR THOSE

16:27.019 --> 16:28.354
COSTS, WHETHER YOU USE YOUR

16:28.354 --> 16:29.988
TIMESHARE OR NOT.

16:29.988 --> 16:32.091
WHICH BRINGS US TO ANOTHER MAJOR

16:32.091 --> 16:33.425
PROBLEM, BECAUSE IF WHAT YOU

16:33.425 --> 16:34.660
BOUGHT IS "POINTS" OR A

16:34.660 --> 16:36.328
"FLOATING WEEK" PLAN, YOU STILL

16:36.328 --> 16:37.129
NEED TO BOOK TIME AT YOUR

16:37.129 --> 16:38.630
RESORT.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.666
WHICH CAN BE UNEXPECTEDLY HARD.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.434
JUST LISTEN TO THIS MAN EXPLAIN

16:42.434 --> 16:44.103
HIS ATTEMPTS TO BOOK A VACATION

16:44.103 --> 16:45.771
AT THE WESTGATE TIMESHARE HE

16:45.771 --> 16:47.306
BOUGHT IN BRANSON, MISSOURI, SIX

16:47.306 --> 16:49.708
YEARS EARLIER.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.343
THE FIRST YEAR--

16:51.343 --> 16:53.011
I CALL A MONTH IN ADVANCE,

16:53.011 --> 16:54.480
THEY SAY, "YOU'RE CALLING,

16:54.480 --> 16:56.248
YOU'RE GIVING US A VERY SHORT

16:56.248 --> 16:56.915
NOTICE."

16:56.915 --> 16:57.616
SO YEAR TWO, THEY CALLED SIX

16:57.616 --> 16:59.251
MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.352
YOU ARE CALLING TOO EARLY.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.587
YEAR THREE, THEY CALLED TWO

17:01.587 --> 17:04.957
MONTHS IN ADVANCE, BUT WE'RE

17:04.957 --> 17:05.491
TOLD THEY CALLED TOO LATE.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.593
THEN YOU CAN STILL GO, BUT WE

17:07.593 --> 17:09.561
HAVE TO CHARGE YOU LIKE ANY

17:09.561 --> 17:10.429
OTHER PERSON.

17:10.429 --> 17:11.530
SO FAR, THE NASEERS HAVE

17:11.530 --> 17:13.499
SPENT MORE THAN $15,000 FOR A

17:13.499 --> 17:15.300
TIMESHARE THEY'VE NEVER SPENT A

17:15.300 --> 17:16.802
SINGLE NIGHT IN.

17:16.802 --> 17:18.170
WHEN THE NASEERS COMPLAINED TO

17:18.170 --> 17:20.105
WESTGATE, THEY WERE TOLD THEY

17:20.105 --> 17:21.373
WOULD HAVE AN EASIER TIME USING

17:21.373 --> 17:23.342
THEIR TIMESHARE IF THEY UPGRADED

17:23.342 --> 17:24.810
TO A BETTER PLAN FOR AN

17:24.810 --> 17:27.679
ADDITIONAL $15,000.

17:27.679 --> 17:29.348
John: THAT'S NOT GREAT.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.916
BEING ASKED TO PAY $15,000 FOR

17:30.916 --> 17:33.619
SOMETHING YOU'VE ONLY SEEN IN

17:33.619 --> 17:35.287
PICTURES IS NOT A TIMESHARE.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.422
THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE AND

17:36.422 --> 17:37.456
REMARKABLY NICHE ONLYFANS

17:37.456 --> 17:39.992
ACCOUNT.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.393
BUT WESTGATE'S RESPONSE IS

17:41.393 --> 17:41.894
PRETTY COMMON ACROSS THE

17:41.894 --> 17:43.295
INDUSTRY.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.563
ONCE YOU BUY A TIMESHARE, THE

17:44.563 --> 17:46.598
PITCH IS, "YOU REALLY NEED TO

17:46.598 --> 17:50.836
UPGRADE TO GET THE MOST-- OR,

17:50.836 --> 17:52.304
POSSIBLY, ANYTHING-- OUT OF

17:52.304 --> 17:52.704
YOUR PURCHASE."

17:52.704 --> 17:53.238
AND THESE UPGRADES ARE A

17:53.238 --> 17:53.872
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE BUSINESS

17:53.872 --> 17:55.307
MODEL.

17:55.307 --> 17:56.141
AT ONE INVESTMENT CONFERENCE,

17:56.141 --> 17:57.643
MARRIOTT STATED THAT EVERY

17:57.643 --> 17:59.912
$30,000 SPENT ON THE PURCHASE OF

17:59.912 --> 18:01.447
A NEW TIMESHARE SHOULD GENERATE

18:01.447 --> 18:04.283
AN EXTRA $20,000 FROM UPGRADES

18:04.283 --> 18:06.752
AFTER JUST FIVE YEARS.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.686
SO IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING THAT

18:07.686 --> 18:09.321
COMPANIES FREQUENTLY PRESSURE

18:09.321 --> 18:10.589
PEOPLE TO PAY FOR UPGRADES,

18:10.589 --> 18:12.791
SOMETIMES WITH THE SAME

18:12.791 --> 18:13.992
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS THAT GOT THEM

18:13.992 --> 18:14.560
TO BUY THE TIMESHARE IN THE

18:14.560 --> 18:16.628
FIRST PLACE.

18:16.628 --> 18:17.963
CUSTOMERS OF WYNDHAM RESORTS

18:17.963 --> 18:19.765
HAVE SAID THAT WHENEVER THEY'D

18:19.765 --> 18:21.366
GO ON VACATION, THEY'D BE FORCED

18:21.366 --> 18:23.235
INTO SO-CALLED "OWNER UPDATE

18:23.235 --> 18:25.537
MEETINGS" WHERE THEY WERE THEN

18:25.537 --> 18:26.138
PRESSURED TO SPEND MORE, LIKE

18:26.138 --> 18:27.339
THIS WOMAN.

18:27.339 --> 18:28.173
THE 76-YEAR-OLD WIDOW IS DEEP

18:28.173 --> 18:30.042
IN DEBT, OWING MORE THAN

18:30.042 --> 18:32.878
$175,000 AFTER SHE CLAIMS SHE

18:32.878 --> 18:34.346
WAS REPEATEDLY TRICKED AND

18:34.346 --> 18:34.947
HARASSED INTO BUYING TIMESHARE

18:34.947 --> 18:37.749
POINTS.

18:37.749 --> 18:38.250
FOLDS ALSO CLAIMS IN HER

18:38.250 --> 18:39.251
LAWSUIT WYNDHAM SALES REPS TOLD

18:39.251 --> 18:40.352
HER THINGS TO CONVINCE HER TO

18:40.352 --> 18:41.954
BUY MORE POINTS THAT ENDED UP

18:41.954 --> 18:43.355
NOT BEING TRUE.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.123
IF I WOULD JUST SIGN IT, THEN

18:45.123 --> 18:46.191
THEY COULD LOWER THE INTEREST

18:46.191 --> 18:47.559
RATES.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.160
IS THAT IN FACT WHAT

18:48.160 --> 18:48.660
HAPPENED?

18:48.660 --> 18:51.463
NO.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.564
SHE SAYS WYNDHAM'S

18:52.564 --> 18:53.632
SALESPEOPLE ALSO TOLD HER THE

18:53.632 --> 18:54.933
COMPANY WOULD BUY BACK ANY EXTRA

18:54.933 --> 18:56.468
POINTS SHE DIDN'T USE, AND THAT,

18:56.468 --> 18:57.870
TOO, SHE LATER FOUND, WASN'T

18:57.870 --> 18:59.004
EXACTLY AS IT HAD BEEN

18:59.004 --> 19:00.205
EXPLAINED.

19:00.205 --> 19:01.607
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO DISCOVER

19:01.607 --> 19:02.341
THAT?

19:02.341 --> 19:04.810
VERY SURPRISED.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.012
NOT ONLY SURPRISED-- YOU MAY

19:07.012 --> 19:08.580
NEED TO BLEEP THIS OUT-- I WAS

19:08.580 --> 19:10.282
MAD AS HELL.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.351
John: WOW, SHE IS PISSED

19:12.351 --> 19:13.318
THERE.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.419
I KNOW "MAD AS HELL" MIGHT NOT

19:14.419 --> 19:17.356
SOUND THAT EXTREME TO US

19:17.356 --> 19:19.057
DELINQUENTS ON HBO, BUT COMING

19:19.057 --> 19:20.359
FROM A 76-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN

19:20.359 --> 19:22.127
TENNESSEE, THAT'S EQUIVALENT OF

19:22.127 --> 19:23.362
A CHILD SCREAMING "MOTHERFUCKER"

19:23.362 --> 19:25.430
THROUGH A BULLHORN, AT AN

19:25.430 --> 19:26.098
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

19:26.098 --> 19:29.568
IT'S THAT LEVEL OF INTENSITY.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.637
SO BETWEEN FEES AND THE CONSTANT

19:31.637 --> 19:33.338
PRESSURE TO PAY FOR UPGRADES,

19:33.338 --> 19:34.239
YOU CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE MIGHT END

19:34.239 --> 19:35.774
UP REGRETTING THEIR PURCHASE.

19:35.774 --> 19:36.975
EVEN THOSE WHO INITIALLY ENJOYED

19:36.975 --> 19:38.911
THEIR TIMESHARE MIGHT END UP

19:38.911 --> 19:40.145
WANTING TO GET RID OF IT.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.346
EITHER BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING

19:41.346 --> 19:42.147
OLDER AND NOT WANTING TO TRAVEL

19:42.147 --> 19:43.181
AS MUCH, OR THEY'RE JUST GETTING

19:43.181 --> 19:44.249
TIRED OF GOING TO THE SAME

19:44.249 --> 19:45.484
PLACE.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.352
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, WHATEVER

19:47.352 --> 19:48.453
YOUR REASON FOR WANTING TO LEAVE

19:48.453 --> 19:50.822
A TIMESHARE, YOU'LL SOON REALIZE

19:50.822 --> 19:54.159
IT'S VERY HARD TO DO.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.661
THAT'S BECAUSE MANY AGREEMENTS

19:55.661 --> 19:56.295
CONTAIN A SO-CALLED "PERPETUITY

19:56.295 --> 19:57.629
CLAUSE."

19:57.629 --> 19:58.897
THAT MEANS THE PURCHASE, AS WELL

19:58.897 --> 20:00.599
AS ALL THOSE REGULAR MAINTENANCE

20:00.599 --> 20:04.036
FEES, ARE A NON-CANCELABLE

20:04.036 --> 20:05.003
LIFETIME OBLIGATION.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.238
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS, A VACATION

20:06.238 --> 20:09.474
HOME SHOULDN'T BE HARDER TO GET

20:09.474 --> 20:11.977
OUT OF THAN SCIENTOLOGY.

20:11.977 --> 20:17.482
WHERE'S SHELLY?

20:17.482 --> 20:19.051
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE, BUT WHERE

20:19.051 --> 20:20.052
IS SHELLEY?

20:20.052 --> 20:20.886
NOW SOME DEVELOPERS CLAIM TO

20:20.886 --> 20:21.553
HAVE PROGRAMS WHERE THEY'LL TAKE

20:21.553 --> 20:22.187
A TIMESHARE BACK, BUT THERE'S A

20:22.187 --> 20:23.021
LOT OF FINE PRINT THERE.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.389
INCLUDING THE FACT THEY'RE OFTEN

20:24.389 --> 20:24.856
ONLY AVAILABLE AT THE

20:24.856 --> 20:26.592
DEVELOPER'S DISCRETION, AND

20:26.592 --> 20:29.127
COULD INVOLVE PAYING A MASSIVE

20:29.127 --> 20:30.095
FEE, WHICH SOMETIMES CAN BE

20:30.095 --> 20:30.996
EQUIVALENT TO TWO YEARS'

20:30.996 --> 20:32.664
MAINTENANCE FEES.

20:32.664 --> 20:33.966
AND IF THE COMPANY WON'T TAKE IT

20:33.966 --> 20:36.802
BACK, GOOD LUCK.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.503
IT CAN BE HARD, IF NOT

20:38.503 --> 20:39.905
IMPOSSIBLE, TO SELL A TIMESHARE.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.607
IN FACT, THE RESALE SITE REDWEEK

20:41.607 --> 20:44.376
SHOWS A NUMBER BEING SOLD FOR

20:44.376 --> 20:46.745
LITERALLY ZERO DOLLARS.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.946
AND KEEP THAT IN MIND ANYTIME

20:47.946 --> 20:49.748
ANYONE SAYS A TIMESHARE IS AN

20:49.748 --> 20:50.616
"INVESTMENT."

20:50.616 --> 20:51.416
INVESTMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO GAIN

20:51.416 --> 20:54.219
VALUE.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.787
A TIMESHARE IS AS SOUND AN

20:55.787 --> 20:57.456
INVESTMENT AS OPENING A

20:57.456 --> 20:58.123
GHISLAINE MAXWELL-THEMED

20:58.123 --> 20:59.424
RESTAURANT.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.759
GHISLY'S!

21:00.759 --> 21:02.127
"WHEN YOU'RE HERE, YOU'RE IN

21:02.127 --> 21:04.196
DANGER!"

21:04.196 --> 21:05.897
AND ALL THIS ACTUALLY GETS ONE

21:05.897 --> 21:07.332
STEP WORSE, THANKS TO SOMETHING

21:07.332 --> 21:09.735
THAT'S OFTEN FRAMED AS A SELLING

21:09.735 --> 21:11.336
POINT FOR TIMESHARES.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.371
THAT'S A GREAT FEELING TO

21:12.371 --> 21:13.005
KNOW THAT OUR GRANDCHILDREN WHEN

21:13.005 --> 21:13.905
WE'RE NOT AROUND--

21:13.905 --> 21:15.674
YEAH, IT'S PASSED ON TO THEM.

21:15.674 --> 21:16.875
UM, WILL BE ENJOYING IT.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.410
IT WILL BE OUR LEGACY TO THEM.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.013
EVEN AS WE PASS ON, IT'S

21:21.013 --> 21:24.016
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

21:24.016 --> 21:25.183
TO GIVE TO OUR CHILDREN.

21:25.183 --> 21:28.186
IT'S A GIFT THAT WILL KEEP ON

21:28.186 --> 21:28.587
GIVING, BEYOND US.

21:28.587 --> 21:29.421
NOW THAT WE HAVE TWO CHILDREN

21:29.421 --> 21:30.789
IT'S KIND OF EXCITING THAT WE

21:30.789 --> 21:31.723
KNOW THAT OUR CREDITS WILL NEVER

21:31.723 --> 21:33.025
GO TO WASTE.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.526
IT WILL STILL BE IN OUR FAMILY

21:34.526 --> 21:35.894
THROUGH OUR BOYS.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.195
John: OKAY, ONE OF THOSE BOYS

21:37.195 --> 21:42.267
SEEMS HAPPY ABOUT THAT, BUT THE

21:42.267 --> 21:43.902
OTHER ONE DOES SEEM PISSED, AND

21:43.902 --> 21:44.469
MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN THE

21:44.469 --> 21:45.637
UPSIDE-DOWN CONSTRUCTION TRUCK

21:45.637 --> 21:47.706
HE'S HOLDING.

21:47.706 --> 21:48.206
AND HE'S HONESTLY RIGHT.

21:48.206 --> 21:48.840
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING TO

21:48.840 --> 21:49.408
TAKE AWAY FROM THIS EPISODE,

21:49.408 --> 21:50.008
IT'S THAT IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE

21:50.008 --> 21:50.942
BETWEEN A TIMESHARE AND AN

21:50.942 --> 21:52.744
UPSIDE-DOWN TRUCK, TAKE THE

21:52.744 --> 21:54.112
TRUCK EVERY TIME.

21:54.112 --> 21:55.213
AT LEAST YOU TECHNICALLY OWN

21:55.213 --> 21:55.947
THAT.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.182
BUT GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN

21:57.182 --> 21:58.617
SO FAR, YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED

21:58.617 --> 21:59.818
TO HEAR THAT MANY PEOPLE AREN'T

21:59.818 --> 22:01.620
SUPER-KEEN ON INHERITING A

22:01.620 --> 22:02.354
TIMESHARE.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.589
AND WHILE YOU CAN TECHNICALLY

22:04.589 --> 22:12.464
DECLINE IT, THAT CAN BE MUCH

22:12.464 --> 22:13.131
HARDER TO DO THAN YOU MIGHT

22:13.131 --> 22:13.331
THINK.

22:13.331 --> 22:13.965
WALKING AWAY DOES TAKE WORK.

22:13.965 --> 22:14.466
NAMELY, YOU MUST FILE A

22:14.466 --> 22:15.100
DISCLAIMER OF INTEREST WITH THE

22:15.100 --> 22:15.734
COURT SAYING THAT YOU REJECT THE

22:15.734 --> 22:16.501
TIMESHARE.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.370
YOU ONLY HAVE NINE MONTHS AFTER

22:18.370 --> 22:18.970
THE DEATH OF YOUR LOVED ONE TO

22:18.970 --> 22:19.971
FILE IT.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.239
AND EVEN THEN, IT'S NOT THAT

22:21.239 --> 22:22.207
SIMPLE.

22:22.207 --> 22:23.709
YOU SEE, WHEN THE FIRST PERSON

22:23.709 --> 22:25.343
IN LINE REJECTS THE TIMESHARE,

22:25.343 --> 22:26.178
IT GOES TO THE NEXT IN LINE AND

22:26.178 --> 22:28.346
THEN THE NEXT AND THE NEXT.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.915
EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS TO FILE

22:29.915 --> 22:32.084
ALL OF THAT PAPERWORK.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.585
John: IT'S TRUE.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.320
EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

22:35.320 --> 22:40.292
AND TIMESHARE PAPERWORK ISN'T

22:40.292 --> 22:41.159
CLEARLY WHAT GRIEVING FAMILIES

22:41.159 --> 22:41.359
NEED.

22:41.359 --> 22:41.960
IT'S PRETTY UPSETTING TO THINK

22:41.960 --> 22:42.694
THAT THERE MIGHT BE A MARKET FOR

22:42.694 --> 22:45.163
SYMPATHY CARDS THAT SAY "I'M

22:45.163 --> 22:46.298
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS, BUT ALSO,

22:46.298 --> 22:47.432
MOVE FAST IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

22:47.432 --> 22:48.834
GET STUCK WITH THE FEES ON YOUR

22:48.834 --> 22:49.301
DEAD MOM'S HILTON HEAD

22:49.301 --> 22:51.503
TWO-BEDROOM."

22:51.503 --> 22:52.137
AND ALL THIS BRINGS US TO WHAT

22:52.137 --> 22:52.838
MIGHT BE THE MOST SURPRISING

22:52.838 --> 22:54.206
THING HERE.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.041
TIMESHARES ARE SO DIFFICULT TO

22:56.041 --> 22:57.776
GET RID OF, A WHOLE SEPARATE

22:57.776 --> 22:59.845
INDUSTRY HAS NOW CROPPED UP,

22:59.845 --> 23:00.412
KNOWN AS THE TIMESHARE EXIT

23:00.412 --> 23:02.481
INDUSTRY.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.116
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ADS ON TV FOR

23:04.116 --> 23:05.584
THEM, OR UPBEAT SEGMENTS ON

23:05.584 --> 23:06.585
LOCAL STATIONS LIKE THESE, FOR A

23:06.585 --> 23:08.520
COMPANY CALLED TIMESHARE

23:08.520 --> 23:10.122
TERMINATION TEAM, WHERE THEY CAN

23:10.122 --> 23:11.523
GET A PRETTY STRONG ENDORSEMENT.

23:11.523 --> 23:12.657
COLORADO'S LOCAL TIMESHARE

23:12.657 --> 23:14.192
TERMINATION TEAM HAS 100%

23:14.192 --> 23:15.761
SUCCESS RATE.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.129
JOINING US, TRUSTED ADVISORS

23:17.129 --> 23:18.563
BRIAN AND HOLLY WILBUR WITH THE

23:18.563 --> 23:20.832
FIRST STEPS YOU NEED TO TAKE TO

23:20.832 --> 23:21.366
LEGALLY GET OUT OF YOUR

23:21.366 --> 23:23.568
TIMESHARE.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.603
I'LL BE HONEST, I KNOW I SAID

23:24.603 --> 23:25.937
THIS BEFORE TOO, I DIDN'T THINK

23:25.937 --> 23:27.639
THIS WAS POSSIBLE, BUT IT

23:27.639 --> 23:28.940
ACTUALLY IS!

23:28.940 --> 23:29.508
John: THAT SOUNDS PRETTY

23:29.508 --> 23:31.643
GREAT!

23:31.643 --> 23:32.944
THE BASIC PITCH OF EXIT

23:32.944 --> 23:34.146
COMPANIES IS, FOR AN UPFRONT

23:34.146 --> 23:35.313
FEE, THEY'LL EITHER RESELL YOUR

23:35.313 --> 23:35.947
TIMESHARE OR GET YOU OUT OF YOUR

23:35.947 --> 23:37.682
CONTRACT.

23:37.682 --> 23:38.950
AND GIVEN HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE

23:38.950 --> 23:39.684
OF THE TIMESHARE INDUSTRY, YOU

23:39.684 --> 23:40.786
MIGHT ASSUME THEY'RE THE GOOD

23:40.786 --> 23:42.788
GUYS IN THIS STORY.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.456
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'RE VERY MUCH

23:44.456 --> 23:46.224
NOT, WHICH YOU PROBABLY ALREADY

23:46.224 --> 23:48.460
GUESSED AFTER THAT WOMAN CLAIMED

23:48.460 --> 23:51.463
A "100% SUCCESS RATE."

23:51.463 --> 23:52.597
BECAUSE THAT'S IS ONE OF THOSE

23:52.597 --> 23:54.166
PHRASES THAT'S AN AUTOMATIC RED

23:54.166 --> 23:56.601
FLAG, LIKE "ENDORSED BY DR. OZ"

23:56.601 --> 23:59.437
OR "FORBES COVER MODEL."

23:59.437 --> 24:00.105
IT JUST IMMEDIATELY RAISES

24:00.105 --> 24:02.374
SUSPICIONS.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.742
ALSO, YOU SHOULD KNOW, WHILE

24:03.742 --> 24:05.811
THAT SURE LOOKS LIKE THE NEWS,

24:05.811 --> 24:07.846
CRUCIALLY, IT-- AND ALL THOSE

24:07.846 --> 24:09.181
SHOWS YOU JUST SAW-- ARE

24:09.181 --> 24:11.149
"SPONSORED CONTENT" PROGRAMS.

24:11.149 --> 24:12.184
WE DID A STORY ON THEM A COUPLE

24:12.184 --> 24:13.285
YEARS AGO, AND IT'S WHERE LOCAL

24:13.285 --> 24:15.053
STATIONS WILL ALLOW YOU TO BUY

24:15.053 --> 24:16.588
YOUR WAY INTO FAKE SEGMENTS THAT

24:16.588 --> 24:17.756
LOOK LIKE NEWS, BUT ARE IN FACT,

24:17.756 --> 24:19.491
ADS.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.059
WE ACTUALLY BOUGHT OUR WAY ONTO

24:21.059 --> 24:23.829
THAT EXACT SHOW, ON DENVER 7, TO

24:23.829 --> 24:25.497
SELL A NAZI FUCK BLANKET.

24:25.497 --> 24:27.098
AND IF YOU MISSED THAT STORY, GO

24:27.098 --> 24:28.400
BACK AND WATCH THE WHOLE THING

24:28.400 --> 24:30.101
BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE HELL OF A

24:30.101 --> 24:30.902
SENTENCE THAT'S MISSING ABOUT 21

24:30.902 --> 24:32.437
MINUTES OF CONTEXT.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.539
ANYWAY, AS IT TURNS OUT,

24:34.539 --> 24:36.508
TIMESHARE TERMINATION TEAM WAS

24:36.508 --> 24:38.410
EVEN SKETCHIER THAN OUR THIRD

24:38.410 --> 24:42.447
REICH FUCK FLEECE, BECAUSE NOT

24:42.447 --> 24:45.550
LONG AFTER THAT, DENVER 7'S

24:45.550 --> 24:46.051
ACTUAL NEWS TEAM HAD THIS

24:46.051 --> 24:46.852
STORY TO REPORT.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.687
DEBI HIRED THE COMPANY IN

24:48.687 --> 24:50.088
JUNE, 2019.

24:50.088 --> 24:52.090
IN ALL, SHE PAID MORE THAN

24:52.090 --> 24:52.891
$14,000.

24:52.891 --> 24:53.558
I SIGNED A CONTRACT, A

24:53.558 --> 24:54.559
TWO-YEAR CONTRACT THAT ENDED

24:54.559 --> 24:57.596
THIS LAST JUNE.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.197
WELL, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CON

24:59.197 --> 25:00.665
- IF THEY DON'T RESOLVE MY

25:00.665 --> 25:03.068
ISSUE, I CAN GET A REFUND.

25:03.068 --> 25:03.735
TWO YEARS CAME AND WENT.

25:03.735 --> 25:04.369
THAT'S WHEN SHE WENT LOOKING FOR

25:04.369 --> 25:06.605
ANSWERS.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.607
AND SO, I CAME TO-- CAME TO

25:08.607 --> 25:10.375
SEE THEM, AND IT'S EMPTY.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.644
THE SIGNS ARE STILL UP ON THE

25:12.644 --> 25:15.180
OFFICE IN GREENWOOD VILLAGE.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.548
BUT THERE'S NO EMPLOYEES.

25:16.548 --> 25:18.183
THE FURNITURE IS GONE.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.284
John: WOW.

25:19.284 --> 25:20.352
FIRST, I'M NOT SURE IT WAS

25:20.352 --> 25:21.453
TOTALLY NECESSARY TO FORCE HER

25:21.453 --> 25:22.787
TO GO BACK AND KNOCK ON THE

25:22.787 --> 25:24.623
GLASS OF A CLEARLY EMPTY OFFICE,

25:24.623 --> 25:25.891
BUT I AM VERY GLAD THAT THEY

25:25.891 --> 25:27.158
DID.

25:27.158 --> 25:27.759
AND SECOND, THAT'S A 19TH

25:27.759 --> 25:29.127
CENTURY SNAKE OIL SALESMAN LEVEL

25:29.127 --> 25:30.662
SCAM.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.264
THEY JUST DISAPPEARED.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.632
ONE MOMENT THEY WERE THERE, AND

25:33.632 --> 25:34.499
THE NEXT THEY WERE SUDDENLY GONE

25:34.499 --> 25:35.533
WITH NO WARNING.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.235
LIKE A GHOST, OR A TV SHOW ON

25:37.235 --> 25:39.905
HBO MAX.

25:39.905 --> 25:40.672
EVERYTHING'S FINE AT THIS

25:40.672 --> 25:41.706
COMPANY.

25:41.706 --> 25:45.977
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

25:45.977 --> 25:46.811
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

25:46.811 --> 25:47.445
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S BY NO

25:47.445 --> 25:48.246
MEANS A ONE-OFF.

25:48.246 --> 25:49.514
AS ONE CONSUMER ADVOCATE PUTS

25:49.514 --> 25:51.082
IT, "I DON'T LIKE

25:51.082 --> 25:52.284
GENERALIZATIONS SO I'LL SAY THAT

25:52.284 --> 25:53.985
99% OF THEM DON'T DO WHAT THEY

25:53.985 --> 25:56.254
SAY THEY WILL, OR WORSE, ARE

25:56.254 --> 25:57.122
OUT-AND-OUT SCAMS."

25:57.122 --> 25:58.556
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:58.556 --> 26:00.158
I DO LIKE GENERALIZATIONS, SO

26:00.158 --> 26:02.027
I'M HAPPY TO SAY TIMESHARE EXIT

26:02.027 --> 26:04.829
COMPANIES ARE TOTAL BULLSHIT.

26:04.829 --> 26:08.033
A LOT HAVE FOLLOWED THE SAME

26:08.033 --> 26:08.867
BASIC PATTERN YOU JUST SAW, THEY

26:08.867 --> 26:09.734
WILL CHARGE AN UPFRONT FEE, AND

26:09.734 --> 26:10.869
THEN EITHER STALL INDEFINITELY

26:10.869 --> 26:13.138
OR FULLY DISAPPEAR.

26:13.138 --> 26:13.772
AND THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

26:13.772 --> 26:15.240
PEOPLE ON A MASSIVE SCALE.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.541
IN MISSOURI, ONE GROUP OF

26:16.541 --> 26:18.109
COMPANIES STANDS ACCUSED OF

26:18.109 --> 26:19.577
DECEIVING CONSUMERS INTO PAYING

26:19.577 --> 26:21.613
MORE THAN $90 MILLION FOR EXIT

26:21.613 --> 26:22.814
SERVICES THAT WERE NOT

26:22.814 --> 26:23.882
DELIVERED.

26:23.882 --> 26:24.950
AND WHILE THAT CASE IS STILL

26:24.950 --> 26:26.618
PENDING, ALL OF THESE OTHER

26:26.618 --> 26:27.452
COMPANIES HAVE GONE UNDER IN

26:27.452 --> 26:30.588
RECENT YEARS.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.790
AND I KNOW THESE EXIT COMPANIES

26:31.790 --> 26:32.691
MIGHT SEEM IMMEDIATELY

26:32.691 --> 26:34.025
SUSPICIOUS TO YOU NOW.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.460
BUT THEY HAVE SLICK MARKETING,

26:35.460 --> 26:37.495
AND HAVE ALSO BEEN ENDORSED BY

26:37.495 --> 26:38.063
SOME SUPPOSEDLY FINANCIALLY

26:38.063 --> 26:38.797
SAVVY PEOPLE.

26:38.797 --> 26:39.764
IN FACT, DAVE RAMSEY, THE

26:39.764 --> 26:42.300
POPULAR PERSONAL-FINANCE GURU--

26:42.300 --> 26:43.601
WHO, TO HIS CREDIT, HAS BEEN A

26:43.601 --> 26:46.137
VOCAL CRITIC OF TIME SHARES--

26:46.137 --> 26:48.039
ACTUALLY GAVE ONE EXIT COMPANY A

26:48.039 --> 26:49.641
RINGING ENDORSEMENT.

26:49.641 --> 26:50.842
TIMESHARE EXIT TEAM WILL GET

26:50.842 --> 26:53.011
YOU OUT OF THEIR TIMESHARE.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.379
NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THEM

26:54.379 --> 26:54.879
MONEY TO DO THAT.

26:54.879 --> 26:55.914
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

26:55.914 --> 26:57.215
AND THEY CHARGE YOU UPFRONT AND

26:57.215 --> 26:58.316
THEY GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY-BACK

26:58.316 --> 27:00.118
GUARANTEE IF THEY DON'T GET YOU

27:00.118 --> 27:01.319
OUT, BUT THEY'LL GET YOU OUT.

27:01.319 --> 27:01.953
John: WELL, THAT SOUNDS

27:01.953 --> 27:04.689
TRUSTWORTHY!

27:04.689 --> 27:05.290
AND WHY WOULDN'T YOU TAKE THE

27:05.290 --> 27:08.426
WORD OF A MAN WHOSE LOOK AND

27:08.426 --> 27:09.594
GENERAL VIBE WHO ANSWERS THE

27:09.594 --> 27:14.899
QUESTION "WHAT IF BILLY JOEL AND

27:14.899 --> 27:16.067
DR. PHIL HAD A KID, AND IT

27:16.067 --> 27:16.601
SUCKED?"

27:16.601 --> 27:17.202
BUT NOT LONG AFTER THAT, THE

27:17.202 --> 27:18.336
WASHINGTON STATE AG SUED

27:18.336 --> 27:19.371
TIMESHARE EXIT TEAM, CLAIMING,

27:19.371 --> 27:19.938
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE

27:19.938 --> 27:20.705
MAJORITY OF ITS CUSTOMERS EITHER

27:20.705 --> 27:21.306
DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR PROMISED

27:21.306 --> 27:24.409
EXIT, RECEIVED ONE THAT CAUSED

27:24.409 --> 27:26.044
THEM UNANTICIPATED NEGATIVE

27:26.044 --> 27:27.645
FINANCIAL OR OTHER CONSEQUENCES,

27:27.645 --> 27:30.081
OR RECEIVED AN EXIT THE CUSTOMER

27:30.081 --> 27:30.548
COULD'VE OBTAINED FOR

27:30.548 --> 27:31.449
THEMSELVES.

27:31.449 --> 27:32.350
THE COMPANY EVENTUALLY SHUT

27:32.350 --> 27:33.551
DOWN, BUT ONLY AFTER IT WAS

27:33.551 --> 27:46.064
FORCED TO PAY RESTITUTION DAVE

27:46.064 --> 27:47.499
YOU THINK THAT GAVE DAVE

27:47.499 --> 27:49.968
RAMSEY PAUSE FOR REFLECTION, YOU

27:49.968 --> 27:50.268
SHOULD KNOW.

27:50.268 --> 27:50.602
IT DID NOT.

27:50.602 --> 27:51.236
BECAUSE AFTER INSIDE EDITION DID

27:51.236 --> 27:51.803
A SEGMENT COVERING TIMESHARE

27:51.803 --> 27:52.470
EXIT TEAM'S ISSUES AND

27:52.470 --> 27:53.304
QUESTIONING HIS ENDORSEMENT OF

27:53.304 --> 27:53.938
THEM, HE PUSHED BACK LIKE THIS.

27:53.938 --> 27:54.572
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD BUY A

27:54.572 --> 27:55.073
STORY ON INSIDE EDITION.

27:55.073 --> 27:55.673
I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T THINK YOU

27:55.673 --> 27:56.307
ALL WERE THAT-- I KNOW YOU WERE

27:56.307 --> 27:56.941
A TABLOID, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU

27:56.941 --> 27:58.777
WERE THAT LOW.

27:58.777 --> 28:00.745
OR ARE YOU JUST SO DUMB THAT YOU

28:00.745 --> 28:01.913
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU WERE ON

28:01.913 --> 28:03.248
THE WRONG SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT

28:03.248 --> 28:06.384
ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSUMER?

28:06.384 --> 28:07.752
SO, THIS IS WHY TIMESHARE'S NOT

28:07.752 --> 28:08.987
ON THE AIR ANYMORE.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.355
TIMESHARE EXIT TEAM.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.189
BUT GUESS WHO'S STILL ON THE

28:11.189 --> 28:12.457
AIR?

28:12.457 --> 28:16.995
ME.

28:16.995 --> 28:20.565
AND I'M SITTING IN A $300

28:20.565 --> 28:25.303
MILLION PAID-FOR BUILDING,

28:25.303 --> 28:28.339
NECK-DEEP IN CASH, YOU JERKS.

28:28.339 --> 28:29.574
John: YEAH!

28:29.574 --> 28:31.076
THAT IS CHAMPION OF THE WORKING

28:31.076 --> 28:32.577
PEOPLE, DAVE RAMSEY, BRAGGING

28:32.577 --> 28:34.345
ABOUT BEING NECK-DEEP IN CASH TO

28:34.345 --> 28:35.880
HIS OWN VIEWERS, WHO GOT CAUGHT

28:35.880 --> 28:36.548
UP IN A SCAM THAT HE ACTIVELY

28:36.548 --> 28:38.116
PROMOTED.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.017
ALL WHILE HAVING HIS HANDS LIKE

28:39.017 --> 28:40.018
THIS, A POSE USED ALMOST

28:40.018 --> 28:42.654
EXCLUSIVELY BY CARTOON SUPER

28:42.654 --> 28:44.022
VILLAINS PLOTTING WAYS TO KILL

28:44.022 --> 28:45.523
BATMAN.

28:45.523 --> 28:46.925
BUT THE THING IS, THERE IS NO

28:46.925 --> 28:49.794
RIGHT SIDE TO BE ON HERE.

28:49.794 --> 28:52.997
TIME SHARE COMPANIES AND

28:52.997 --> 28:54.032
TIMESHARE EXIT COMPANIES ARE

28:54.032 --> 28:55.934
BOTH TERRIBLE.

28:55.934 --> 28:56.734
ONE IS A SHITTY BUSINESS MODEL

28:56.734 --> 28:57.936
THAT'S SOMEHOW TECHNICALLY

28:57.936 --> 28:59.637
LEGAL, AND THE OTHER IS

28:59.637 --> 29:00.438
OFTENTIMES AN OUT-AND-OUT SCAM,

29:00.438 --> 29:03.208
BUT NEITHER IS GOOD.

29:03.208 --> 29:04.976
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO

29:04.976 --> 29:05.910
LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT,

29:05.910 --> 29:06.744
BENEATH ALL OF THIS, ARE PEOPLE

29:06.744 --> 29:08.213
WHO CAN GET VICTIMIZED.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.747
AND IN SOME CASES, TWICE.

29:09.747 --> 29:10.849
AND IF YOU WATCH A LOT OF

29:10.849 --> 29:11.816
STORIES ABOUT THESE COMPANIES,

29:11.816 --> 29:12.917
IT'S HEARTBREAKING JUST HOW

29:12.917 --> 29:14.385
OFTEN THE PEOPLE IN THEM TALK

29:14.385 --> 29:16.387
ABOUT HOW ASHAMED THEY FEEL

29:16.387 --> 29:18.556
ABOUT FALLING FOR THEM.

29:18.556 --> 29:19.224
NOBODY IN MY FAMILY KNOWS.

29:19.224 --> 29:21.392
NOBODY.

29:21.392 --> 29:22.160
IT MAKES YOU FEEL BAD WHEN

29:22.160 --> 29:23.561
YOU THINK YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING

29:23.561 --> 29:24.129
THIS STUPID.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.331
WHEN WE BOUGHT THE TIMESHARE

29:26.331 --> 29:27.232
WHICH TOOK US TO THE CLEANERS

29:27.232 --> 29:29.767
AND IT JUST MADE ME FEEL STUPID.

29:29.767 --> 29:30.568
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

29:30.568 --> 29:32.437
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE-- I-- I

29:32.437 --> 29:34.005
THINK I'M SMARTER THAN THAT.

29:34.005 --> 29:34.706
John: YEAH, I GET THAT.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.808
BUT TO BE CLEAR, THE SHAME HERE

29:36.808 --> 29:37.442
SHOULD NOT BE ON THE PEOPLE WHO

29:37.442 --> 29:39.077
WERE DUPED.

29:39.077 --> 29:39.978
IT SHOULD BE ON THE INDUSTRIES

29:39.978 --> 29:41.412
THAT EXPLOITED THEM, TOLD THEM

29:41.412 --> 29:43.148
"ANY FRIGGING THING" THEY WANTED

29:43.148 --> 29:44.482
TO, AND ABUSED THEIR

29:44.482 --> 29:46.251
UNDERSTANDABLE DESIRE JUST TO

29:46.251 --> 29:48.119
TAKE A FUCKING BREAK!

29:48.119 --> 29:50.054
SO, WHAT CAN WE DO?

29:50.054 --> 29:51.789
WELL, ON THE OFF CHANCE ANYONE

29:51.789 --> 29:53.424
WATCHING RIGHT NOW IS

29:53.424 --> 29:54.425
CONSIDERING A TIMESHARE, DON'T

29:54.425 --> 29:56.060
DO IT!

29:56.060 --> 29:57.462
IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE CONSIDERING

29:57.462 --> 29:59.497
IT, SEND THEM THIS SEGMENT.

29:59.497 --> 30:00.899
IF YOU HAPPEN TO INHERIT A TIME

30:00.899 --> 30:01.533
SHARE, GET RID OF IT AS FAST AS

30:01.533 --> 30:03.835
POSSIBLE.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.303
AND IF IT'S TOO LATE, AND YOU'RE

30:05.303 --> 30:06.905
STUCK WITH IT, YOU CAN TRY AND

30:06.905 --> 30:09.240
GIVE IT AWAY FOR $0 ONLINE, BUT

30:09.240 --> 30:10.475
THE TRUTH IS, YOU'LL ONLY BE

30:10.475 --> 30:12.577
FUCKING SOMEONE ELSE OVER THEN.

30:12.577 --> 30:13.878
UNFORTUNATELY, THE BEST OPTION

30:13.878 --> 30:15.213
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE TO CALL THE

30:15.213 --> 30:17.582
TIMESHARE COMPANY AND SEE IF

30:17.582 --> 30:18.283
THERE'S ANY CHANCE THAT THEY

30:18.283 --> 30:20.818
WILL TAKE IT BACK.

30:20.818 --> 30:22.353
AS FOR EXIT COMPANIES, AS YOU'VE

30:22.353 --> 30:23.821
SEEN THERE'S BEEN SPORADIC LEGAL

30:23.821 --> 30:25.390
ACTION AGAINST INDIVIDUAL

30:25.390 --> 30:28.159
COMPANIES, BUT BY AND LARGE,

30:28.159 --> 30:29.727
IT'S A WHACK-A-MOLE ECOSYSTEM.

30:29.727 --> 30:30.361
WHEN ONE GOES DOWN, ANOTHER ONE

30:30.361 --> 30:32.564
TENDS TO POP RIGHT UP.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.998
SO THE TRUTH IS, THE BEST BET

30:33.998 --> 30:35.433
RIGHT NOW SEEMS TO BE TO MAKE

30:35.433 --> 30:37.735
SURE WE ALL WARN EACH OTHER

30:37.735 --> 30:39.270
ABOUT JUST HOW FUCKED UP THIS

30:39.270 --> 30:41.539
WHOLE INDUSTRY IS.

30:41.539 --> 30:43.241
OR I SUPPOSE, WE COULD GO

30:43.241 --> 30:44.475
ANOTHER WAY WITH IT.

30:44.475 --> 30:45.243
AND IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM, JOIN

30:45.243 --> 30:46.611
