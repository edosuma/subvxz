00:41.400 --> 00:46.900
(mellow music playing)

00:56.900 --> 01:00.433
-Dorothy, I want a driver's license.
-What for?

01:00.900 --> 01:03.700
I'm doing a lot of stunt work
in the new Burt Reynolds movie.

01:03.767 --> 01:07.266
-Why do you think?
-You haven't driven in years.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.133
Why is this coming up now?

01:09.834 --> 01:13.333
This morning at the center,
Gladys Weinstock and I were fighting.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.800
We both claim we're natural redheads,
but at our age, we can't prove it anymore.

01:19.233 --> 01:20.633
So?

01:20.700 --> 01:24.967
So, when I pulled out my license to show
her, everyone saw it was expired.

01:25.033 --> 01:26.867
It made me feel old.

01:27.367 --> 01:31.834
-I want to learn again.
-Come on, ma. You're 81 years old.

01:31.900 --> 01:35.433
Your eyesight is weaker,
your reflexes are slower.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.300
And who are you, Magic Johnson?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.834
Dorothy, please.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.600
All right, ma, we'll try it.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.500
If anything goes wrong, we stop.

01:45.567 --> 01:48.300
Relax. Some things you never forget.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.567
Driving a car is like making love.

01:52.100 --> 01:56.166
In both cases, a mirror makes objects
appear larger than they really are.

02:00.834 --> 02:04.467
I'm just so angry.
Floyd McCallum just called me

02:04.533 --> 02:08.867
one hour before he's supposed to pick me
up in his brand-new Mercedes.

02:08.934 --> 02:10.567
He's canceled our date for tonight.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.633
He probably had a good reason.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.800
He said he's visiting his mother
in the hospital.

02:15.867 --> 02:19.867
-Did you ever hear such a weak excuse?
-She isn't in the hospital.

02:19.934 --> 02:22.667
She is, but he can visit her anytime.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.166
He can only see me tonight.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.700
-Is my cousin Sven here yet?
-No, Rose.

02:30.767 --> 02:36.734
Good. I was working late
and barely had time to pick up this cake.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.867
Rose, that cake is from the Get It While
It's Hot erotic bake shop.

02:43.066 --> 02:44.400
Whoa-ho!

02:47.567 --> 02:49.300
Why, Rose Nylund...

02:49.633 --> 02:52.734
-that cake is in the shape of--
-Blanche, we know what it is.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.467
I thought it was in the shape of Florida.

03:10.567 --> 03:13.500
That reminds me,
I got to give Charley Milbourne a call.

03:16.266 --> 03:18.400
If this cake reminds you
of Charley Milbourne,

03:18.467 --> 03:19.967
we could both give him a call.

03:23.066 --> 03:29.133
Rose, how long is your cousin Sven
going to, uh... be, uh... staying with us?

03:30.633 --> 03:35.100
Just a couple of days. Saturday, he's
flying to St. Olaf to meet his fiancée.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.100
-Oh, she went on alone?
-No, he's never met her.

03:38.166 --> 03:39.834
It's an arranged marriage.

03:40.433 --> 03:43.700
See, Little Sven's father,
we call him Big Sven...

03:44.233 --> 03:48.233
left the old country two years ago,
settled in St. Olaf,

03:48.300 --> 03:50.000
and sent for the rest of his family.

03:50.066 --> 03:53.266
First he brought his father.
We call him Big Sven II.

03:54.433 --> 03:58.000
Doesn't that get confusing,
having two Big Svens?

03:58.066 --> 04:01.533
There aren't, Blanche.
There's Big Sven and Big Sven II,

04:01.600 --> 04:03.500
like <i>Jaws</i> and <i>Jaws II.</i>

04:05.033 --> 04:08.500
Are any of your relatives
named psycho and psycho II?

04:11.066 --> 04:14.066
Anyway, Big Sven
picked out a bride for Little Sven,

04:14.133 --> 04:16.000
and now he's flying him over.

04:16.066 --> 04:20.400
It seems so unfair to me,
an arranged marriage.

04:20.467 --> 04:24.367
I don't know, it can be fun.
George and I had that kind of marriage.

04:24.767 --> 04:31.066
George would dress as a ghost and chase me
around the house with a fly swatter--

04:31.133 --> 04:36.767
Blanche, I'm talking about arranged
marriages, not deranged marriages.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.266
Oh. Sorry.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.734
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, that must be Sven.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.166
-Cousin Rose?
-Cousin Sven! Oh!

04:49.233 --> 04:53.600
Oh, let me look at you.
Boy, have you grown!

04:54.433 --> 04:58.367
-We've never met.
-But admit it, you have grown.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.934
Uh, Rose, could you
introduce Blanche and me?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.400
Oh, of course.

05:05.467 --> 05:07.867
Dorothy, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Dorothy.

05:07.934 --> 05:12.400
(laughs)
We joke like that here all the time.

05:12.467 --> 05:15.800
It's like a house full of Howie Mandels.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.200
-Sven, I'm Dorothy.
-Hello.

05:18.266 --> 05:20.700
-And I'm Blanche. Welcome.
-Thank you.

05:20.767 --> 05:25.500
-Rose says you're getting married.
-I hope I'm good at it.

05:25.834 --> 05:28.500
I don't have that much experience
with women.

05:28.567 --> 05:32.166
A big, strong, handsome thing like you?
Get out of here.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.166
Well, it was nice meeting all of you.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.200
Oh, no! That was an expression! Sven?

05:42.567 --> 05:46.367
I never thought I'd say this, but I think
Rose got the brains in that family.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.367
Meet me outside. I'll pull the car around.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.233
Hold it. Ma, hold it.

06:01.767 --> 06:05.967
I said we don't do any driving
until we've gone over the rules

06:06.033 --> 06:08.834
-in the driving manual.
-What's to go over?

06:08.900 --> 06:13.533
"How much distance should there be
between you and a fire hydrant?"

06:13.600 --> 06:15.000
What am I, a poodle?

06:18.233 --> 06:20.233
-Oh, morning, girls.
-Morning.

06:20.567 --> 06:27.066
-What got you two up and out so early?
-I wanted to show Sven the sights today.

06:27.133 --> 06:30.800
Did you photograph him with that
Mr. Whipple cutout at the A&amp;P?

06:31.633 --> 06:35.166
We picked up breakfast before our big day.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.900
-Will you ladies join us?
-What are you making?

06:37.967 --> 06:39.667
-Flenderheuven.
-What's that?

06:39.734 --> 06:44.367
Oatmeal. It's usually served
with crackers made from yak intestine.

06:45.066 --> 06:47.934
Of course! Yak snacks.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.967
Hi, girls. Hi, Sven.

06:51.266 --> 06:52.934
It's Sven, Blanche.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.667
Whatever. Dorothy, could I borrow
your windbreaker?

06:56.734 --> 07:00.233
Floyd is taking me sailing on his yacht.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.767
-Blanche--
-I guess he felt guilty

07:02.834 --> 07:06.166
about canceling last night
and wanted to do something extra-special.

07:06.233 --> 07:09.100
-Uh, Blanche--
-I can hardly wait.

07:09.166 --> 07:13.100
If you're about to say Floyd called
and canceled, I don't want to hear.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.867
-He called.
-Oh! This is the last straw.

07:17.133 --> 07:20.834
I don't care if Floyd owns
the most successful pet neutering business

07:20.900 --> 07:22.033
in greater Miami.

07:22.734 --> 07:27.333
I am never speaking
to that low-down scuzzball ever again.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.767
-(telephone rings)
-He changed his mind.

07:31.734 --> 07:32.867
Hello.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.000
Yes, this is Rose.

07:36.166 --> 07:39.166
Uh-huh.

07:40.433 --> 07:43.166
Well, ok. Bye.

07:44.834 --> 07:48.233
-Sven, I have bad news.
-Is it bad news?

07:48.300 --> 07:49.367
Yes, bad.

07:49.433 --> 07:52.367
Were you the cousins
who played the banjo in <i>Deliverance?</i>

07:57.367 --> 08:00.000
-Rose, what's wrong?
-That was the counseling center.

08:00.066 --> 08:04.233
I have to work today.
Who will show Sven the sights?

08:04.300 --> 08:07.867
The only sights we're seeing
is the parking lot behind the mall.

08:07.934 --> 08:10.066
I already showed him that.

08:11.734 --> 08:16.200
Wait. Blanche, you're free.
Why don't you take Sven around?

08:16.266 --> 08:19.533
-I don't feel like sightseeing.
-It might do you good.

08:19.600 --> 08:25.266
It will, and it's healthier
than sitting here stewing all day.

08:25.767 --> 08:26.900
Maybe you're right.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.834
A day on the town
with a handsome man

08:29.900 --> 08:34.266
might take my mind off
old what's-his-name.

08:35.800 --> 08:36.800
Floyd.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.900
Ok. Come on, Sven.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.867
-It's Sven.
-He's mine now.

08:43.934 --> 08:45.066
I can call him what I want to.

08:49.066 --> 08:54.033
(serene music playing)

08:55.467 --> 08:58.066
If you don't mind,
I like to pay for lunch.

08:58.133 --> 09:03.467
-Oh, don't be silly, Sven.
-No, you gave me a great tour today.

09:03.967 --> 09:07.700
We don't have that many women's shoe
stores in my whole country.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.867
-Oh, my lord, look who walked in.
-Who?

09:13.333 --> 09:14.467
Floyd.

09:14.900 --> 09:18.800
(Blanche) And that young thing
with him is half his age.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.467
She's half your age.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.333
-Shut up and hold my hand.
-What?

09:28.400 --> 09:32.867
Hold my hand. Look deep into my eyes.

09:32.934 --> 09:35.066
Ok. Move your lips around.
Go like this.

09:35.133 --> 09:40.133
-Blanche, I can't--
-Get ready to kiss me. Get set. Go.

09:42.033 --> 09:45.734
-Blanche, is that you?
-Well, Floyd McCallum,

09:45.800 --> 09:52.400
shame on you, sneaking up on us like that,
and in front of this young child too.

09:53.734 --> 09:55.333
Blanche, this is Linda.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.867
Hello, honey. Is your daddy
taking you to lunch?

09:58.533 --> 10:00.133
Linda's just a friend, Blanche.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.533
Oops! (laughs)

10:02.600 --> 10:07.300
Floyd, I'm just so embarrassed
at you catching me and Sven like this.

10:07.367 --> 10:12.900
Course, you should have seen us earlier.
We were feeding each other.

10:14.867 --> 10:17.533
(Floyd) Blanche, look,
about those dates I canceled--

10:17.600 --> 10:19.867
Oh, forget about that. I have.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.767
-Can I call you later?
-What? Sure, if you want.

10:23.834 --> 10:28.834
I'm not sure I'll be home.
I have this craving for dessert.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.600
We're going to Sven's place.

10:30.667 --> 10:36.133
We can try, but I've never sailed around
the cape of good hope this time of year.

10:38.567 --> 10:42.233
(calm music playing)

10:42.300 --> 10:45.633
I'm never getting into a car
with you again.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.633
I can't believe you're being such a wimp.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.767
Ma, you ran the stop sign,

10:51.834 --> 10:55.533
you hit a mailbox,
you almost ran over Mrs. Burlfine.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.767
The woman's already in a wheelchair.
How much more damage could I do?

11:04.133 --> 11:06.533
Hi, Dorothy.
Why is your lipstick all smeared?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.433
I just kissed our driveway.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.066
-Hi, everybody.
-Hello, Rose.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.600
Hi, Rose. Would you teach me how to drive?

11:19.033 --> 11:20.400
Sure, Sophia,

11:20.467 --> 11:24.700
if you teach me to be
a great Italian cook.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.700
Everybody's a comedian today.

11:28.867 --> 11:31.800
Rose, everything okay down
at the counseling center?

11:31.867 --> 11:33.467
Yes, finally.

11:33.533 --> 11:35.900
We had a manic-depressive
overload.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.200
Luckily, Dr. Ferguson
had some new knock-knock jokes.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.467
That seemed to do the trick.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.600
-Knock-knock?
-Who's there?

11:43.667 --> 11:44.867
Shut up, Rose!

11:47.734 --> 11:51.166
-Hello, ladies. Hi, cousin Rose.
-Sven, hi.

11:51.233 --> 11:55.667
Let's do something really special tonight
in honor of your wedding.

11:56.233 --> 11:58.633
There isn't going to be a wedding.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.066
What? Why not?

12:01.133 --> 12:05.367
I decided I can't marry
someone that I don't love.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.767
You've never met Olga.
How do you know you don't love her?

12:08.834 --> 12:11.633
I'm in love with someone else.

12:12.734 --> 12:14.734
I'm in love
with Blanche.

12:32.667 --> 12:36.433
Sven, you can't be serious.
You're not in love with me.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.700
I know it's sudden,
but I feel it in my heart.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.900
His father will kill me.

12:42.967 --> 12:46.233
Sven's here for one day,
and he falls for the first floozy

12:46.300 --> 12:47.567
that turns his head.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.600
Did something happen between you and Sven
that we don't know about?

12:56.133 --> 12:59.300
-You didn't tell them about kissing me?
-Kissing him?

12:59.367 --> 13:02.600
-Or stroking my hair?
-Stroking his hair?

13:02.667 --> 13:03.967
Or feeding me?

13:05.667 --> 13:07.800
Ok, I'll say it. Feeding him?

13:10.033 --> 13:13.567
I can't hear any more.
How could you do this?

13:13.633 --> 13:15.934
Rose, wait a minute.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.767
It's not like you think.

13:18.834 --> 13:21.934
If Sven said you kissed him,
you kissed him.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
I did kiss him, but it was pretend.
We were having lunch.

13:27.066 --> 13:29.734
Floyd walked in with another woman.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.100
I pretended Sven was my boyfriend
to make Floyd jealous.

13:33.166 --> 13:36.967
-Did you explain to Sven?
-Well, I assumed he knew.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.100
How could you assume anything?

13:39.166 --> 13:42.967
The man offered
to kill dinner for us last night.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.900
Maybe I made a mistake, but I don't think
I did anything so terrible.

13:51.266 --> 13:52.734
Well, I do.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.667
There's a sweet, innocent man in there
whose heart will get broken

13:56.734 --> 13:59.867
because you used him
in one of your petty games.

13:59.934 --> 14:03.934
Rose, look at the other side of it.
He did get to kiss me.

14:05.667 --> 14:09.266
Big deal. More people kiss you
than the Pope's ring.

14:13.133 --> 14:14.800
Blanche, you have to go
in there and talk to him.

14:14.867 --> 14:16.867
I will, I will.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.533
It's just that I'm not very good at it
I was only blessed with one talent.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.066
Turning men on.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.567
I've just never known
how to turn them off.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.033
You tell him, Dorothy.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.500
I would, Blanche, but remember
we just wanna turn him off

14:35.567 --> 14:38.567
not drain the sex drive
completely out of him.

14:42.333 --> 14:46.033
You know, I've always had this trouble
ever since high school.

14:46.100 --> 14:50.100
I was the head cheerleader
and I was dating our star quarterback,

14:50.166 --> 14:51.633
Carlwell Honeycutt.

14:52.166 --> 14:55.967
Well, time came to break up and I just
could not tell Carlwell to his face.

14:56.433 --> 15:00.367
I couldn't bare to inflict that much grief
and suffering on one man.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.633
So I finally decided...

15:03.333 --> 15:07.734
that the best way to handle it was just
to lead my girls in a farewell cheer.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.100
Two, four, six, eight,
who will Blanche no longer date?

15:12.166 --> 15:13.166
Carlwell!

15:18.700 --> 15:20.033
Did he get the message...

15:20.400 --> 15:23.700
or did the band have to spell
out "buzz off" at half time?

15:24.367 --> 15:25.900
(laughs)

15:25.967 --> 15:28.166
Now, you have to go in there
and set Sven straight.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.934
The longer you wait
the harder it will get.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.800
-I know, you're right and I will.
-Of course she's right.

15:32.867 --> 15:36.834
You know, I once made
the same mistake myself.

15:37.433 --> 15:41.533
I was dating a guy
my parents could not stand.

15:41.600 --> 15:46.467
He used to come over to the house
during Sunday, help himself to some food,

15:46.533 --> 15:48.000
take it into the living room

15:48.066 --> 15:52.100
turn on one of those radio countdown shows
and belch to the music.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.567
Ew.

15:53.633 --> 15:56.767
Well, finally my mother told me
that I just had to break it off.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.100
And of course, I knew she was right.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.633
So I rehearsed my speech
and I made arrangements

16:02.700 --> 16:04.433
to meet him at a coffee shop.

16:05.033 --> 16:08.800
I got there five minutes early
and caught him necking with a waitress.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.300
-Well, that must have made it easier.
-No, I still could not do it.

16:13.367 --> 16:15.700
Dorothy, how long had you been
together with this guy.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.033
Thirty-eight years.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.667
That was Stan?

16:21.467 --> 16:25.600
And you know, to this day he can
belch out the chorus

16:25.667 --> 16:29.066
to "Sweet Georgia Brown"
on one Dr. Pepper.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.600
Well, I'm gonna go talk to Sven.

16:36.066 --> 16:38.467
I'll just let him down gently.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.967
In the old country,
when a woman dumps a man,

16:43.033 --> 16:45.700
then the man is allowed
to shave the woman's head

16:45.767 --> 16:47.700
and make her wear a itchy hat.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.633
I hear Pakistan has the same
penalty for jaywalking.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.066
-Sven?
-Hi, Blanche.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.333
Is something wrong?

17:03.600 --> 17:06.600
No, I'm just embarrassed
about what happened before.

17:06.667 --> 17:10.400
-Embarrassed? Why, what for?
-For acting so crazy.

17:10.467 --> 17:14.400
-That wasn't crazy.
-Yes. We kissed one time.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.300
I let it go straight to my head.

17:17.033 --> 17:20.900
I've been trying to understand
why I acted that way.

17:21.567 --> 17:25.367
Could it be I'm nervous about
getting married?

17:25.433 --> 17:26.533
Yes.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.066
Or that I'm not used to being
with a beautiful woman like you?

17:30.133 --> 17:31.133
Yes.

17:31.200 --> 17:36.700
-Or that I'm naive and inexperienced?
-Yes.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
No.

17:39.967 --> 17:42.100
It's none of those things, Blanche.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.700
It's because I like you.

17:45.100 --> 17:49.700
-I like everything about you.
-Sven, you hardly know me.

17:49.767 --> 17:53.333
-I know enough. I know you're pretty.
-Yes.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.867
-You're smart.
-Yes.

17:54.934 --> 17:59.000
-Sexy, sophisticated...
-Yes... no!

17:59.066 --> 18:03.000
Sven, there's something very important
you don't know.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.166
Oh, I don't know how to say this.

18:06.333 --> 18:10.600
-It's the reason I kissed you.
-To make Floyd jealous.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.400
-You knew that?
-Yes.

18:13.467 --> 18:17.767
And you had every right. He deserved it,
the way he's been rejecting you.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.600
What do you mean, rejecting me?

18:22.633 --> 18:27.300
Canceling twice in two days,
then showing up with that girl.

18:27.367 --> 18:30.367
-How old could she have been?
-Not very.

18:30.433 --> 18:31.500
Mmm.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.133
You're not like most women, Blanche.

18:35.767 --> 18:36.934
What do you mean?

18:37.000 --> 18:42.200
Wouldn't most women let a thing like this
make them feel old?

18:42.900 --> 18:44.633
-Yes.
-And unattractive?

18:44.700 --> 18:47.633
-Yes.
-Worn-out? Useless?

18:51.333 --> 18:52.800
What's your point, Sven?

18:55.100 --> 19:01.200
My point is, I was hoping that maybe
you're tired of people like Floyd

19:01.266 --> 19:02.667
who don't appreciate you

19:02.734 --> 19:06.000
and you're ready to spend time
with someone who does.

19:07.266 --> 19:08.300
Like you?

19:08.767 --> 19:13.400
You don't know me well yet,
but I'm asking for a chance.

19:17.633 --> 19:21.033
-Ok, I'll think about it.
-Thank you, Blanche.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.600
You're welcome, Sven.

19:33.800 --> 19:39.900
(serene music playing)

19:43.100 --> 19:44.300
Hi, ma.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.133
Read it and weep.

19:48.633 --> 19:51.367
A driver's license?
Ma, how did you get this?

19:51.433 --> 19:55.233
Determination. If you put your mind to it,
you can do anything.

19:55.300 --> 20:01.233
-Ma, I forbid you to drive a car.
-Ooh, look, Dorothy, I'm shaking.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.800
Ma, I mean it.

20:06.467 --> 20:11.066
Lighten up. I told you,
I only want a license to have, not to use.

20:11.133 --> 20:14.000
It symbolizes my freedom,
my independence.

20:14.367 --> 20:15.633
Now give me $50.

20:16.467 --> 20:17.700
What for?

20:17.767 --> 20:20.200
A guy named Paco makes these
babies up in his garage.

20:20.266 --> 20:21.266
Oh.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.166
Morning, girls.

20:27.633 --> 20:30.800
I didn't sleep a wink
worrying about Blanche and Sven.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.533
This is between the two of them.

20:33.600 --> 20:37.467
No, it isn't. I'm supposed to get Sven
on a plane today.

20:37.800 --> 20:43.800
I called Big Sven to ask what to do.
He gets up with the cows.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.166
I know he does
because he sleeps with the cows.

20:48.633 --> 20:52.633
-What is your point, Rose?
-Big Sven was furious with me.

20:52.967 --> 20:57.033
He said he'd handle everything.
He hung up on me.

20:57.100 --> 21:00.300
-Good morning.
-Maybe it is for you.

21:00.667 --> 21:05.567
You can't stay mad at me over this.
I feel bad too.

21:05.633 --> 21:10.800
Did you have an angry Viking
swearing at you in Scandinavian

21:10.867 --> 21:14.000
-on the phone this morning?
-My guess would be no.

21:16.033 --> 21:20.066
Rose, as I told you last night,
your cousin is a very sensitive man.

21:20.133 --> 21:25.133
I have to find the right time
and let him down softly.

21:26.367 --> 21:27.767
Morning, everyone.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.066
-(doorbell rings)
-Who could that be?

21:36.734 --> 21:38.400
-Rose Nylund?
-Yes?

21:38.467 --> 21:39.667
Wow.

21:42.100 --> 21:46.900
I'm Olga Nordström from St. Olaf.
I'm looking for Sven Lindström.

21:47.266 --> 21:50.000
-He's right there.
-Wow.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.800
Sven, your father sent me.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.133
I was chosen to be your bride.

21:57.633 --> 22:00.000
I'm not leaving this house without you.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.734
Wow.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.333
Now might be the time to let him down
softly.

22:10.233 --> 22:13.266
A cab is waiting, Sven. Will you come?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.500
Blanche, I've done some thinking.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.467
I could never make you happy.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.233
If you could never make her happy,

22:22.300 --> 22:24.867
good luck with
the lean, mean, Swedish machine.

22:28.900 --> 22:32.500
I understand, Sven. Go on. Go on.

22:33.667 --> 22:38.266
I'm coming, Olga.
Oh, cousin Rose, thank you.

22:38.333 --> 22:41.734
Thank you all.
Wait. What about my clothes?

22:41.800 --> 22:43.600
They're ugly. Any other questions?

22:46.100 --> 22:49.567
I'll send them to you.
You two be on your way. Good luck.

22:49.633 --> 22:52.033
Thank you. Bye.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.834
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

22:55.900 --> 22:58.667
Wonderful? He just dropped me.

22:58.734 --> 23:02.533
Blanche, come on.
You had no interest in Sven.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.867
That's not the point.

23:04.934 --> 23:09.934
For the second time in two days,
I've been thrown over for a younger woman.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.300
-I can't compete anymore.
-Oh, honey, of course you can.

23:14.367 --> 23:19.934
You just have to compete in a different
way, like with intelligence and charm.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.233
I don't know those ways,
and I'm too old to learn.

23:24.166 --> 23:28.433
-I'm over the hill.
-(telephone rings)

23:28.500 --> 23:30.567
I'm in the same boat with you two.

23:30.633 --> 23:31.700
Hello.

23:32.166 --> 23:33.300
Yes.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.800
All right.

23:38.467 --> 23:39.633
Goodbye.

23:40.133 --> 23:43.900
What do you know?
Floyd McCallum is taking me sailing.

23:44.533 --> 23:46.467
I guess you two are in the same boat.

23:49.266 --> 23:50.533
I'm in the yacht.

23:54.266 --> 23:59.300
-What's this boat she keeps talking about?
-Don't worry, Rose. You missed it.

24:09.133 --> 24:14.934
(theme music playing)
