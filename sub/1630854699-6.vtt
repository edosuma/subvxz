WEBVTT

01:12.030 --> 01:12.864
Freydis!

01:21.289 --> 01:23.458
Where is Freydis?
Where is she?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.795
-Freydis! Where is she?

01:30.006 --> 01:32.133
-I don't know!
-Traitor!

01:32.217 --> 01:33.343
She's not here!

01:40.141 --> 01:42.310
-Where is she hiding?
-She's not here.

01:44.646 --> 01:45.480
Please.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.774
It does no good looking for her here.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.993
Where else would she be?

02:00.620 --> 02:01.621
I don't know.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.125
I do.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.316
Where exactly did you see her?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.402
She was over there.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.366
-Cover the west side. Let's move forward.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.450
-Nobody's here.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.841
We found something.

02:54.924 --> 02:55.842
Here!

03:02.807 --> 03:04.058
What about the body?

03:04.726 --> 03:07.020
No. But there are wolf tracks.

03:53.691 --> 03:56.319
I've never known a woman to laugh so much.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.530
How can I not?

04:01.324 --> 04:02.367
I'm free!

04:09.582 --> 04:11.876
Batu! Come join us.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.263
Allfather.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.638
Pechenegs.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.265
If we survive the falls,

05:08.308 --> 05:09.809
then we have to survive them.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.441
Pack up. We're moving on.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.402
You have seen the falls?

05:19.485 --> 05:20.361
We have.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.865
I'm not going to lie to you.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.533
It will be a challenge.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.869
We'll have to prepare ourselves
to go down it.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.912
When do we leave?

05:29.996 --> 05:32.081
-Tomorrow.
-What?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.876
No! Why so soon?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.669
The water level is dropping.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.797
If we wait longer,
the boat will not make it over the falls.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.716
And we will all be trapped here.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.092
Is that such a bad thing?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.262
Batu, the longer we stay here,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.681
the greater the chance
the Pechenegs will find us.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.850
Then we portage.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.895
The Varangian said
the Pechenegs have moved east.

05:53.978 --> 05:54.812
He lied.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.065
There are many camps
visible from the falls.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.942
Could see fires on the plains below.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.862
We've risked enough
camping here the last few nights.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.697
The sooner we move, the better.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.825
Then I am not sure we'll be joining you.

06:08.910 --> 06:09.744
What?

06:14.749 --> 06:15.583
Why not?

06:16.542 --> 06:18.378
I am not ready to die.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.968
You would all rather risk the Pechenegs?

06:29.555 --> 06:30.890
They haven't found us yet.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.268
And you can't tell us
the fall is without risk.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.853
Nothing is without risk!

06:36.896 --> 06:39.816
All we have done
for the last two moons has been with risk.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.193
But before, we had no choice. Now, we do.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.278
I choose to stay.

06:46.989 --> 06:47.824
I do too.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.248
Batu?

06:57.041 --> 06:57.875
I'm not sure.

06:59.877 --> 07:00.711
Elena?

07:01.379 --> 07:03.214
I share their feelings.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.635
What is all this?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.097
We have known for months
this day will come.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.351
And now, when it is finally here,

07:16.477 --> 07:19.021
you are not willing to meet the challenge?

07:20.481 --> 07:21.482
I will not wait here

07:21.566 --> 07:25.611
and let the Pechenegs
make a flute out of my coward's bones!

07:26.404 --> 07:27.905
I'll go by myself if I must.

07:27.989 --> 07:28.823
You can't.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.535
What do you mean I can't?

07:33.286 --> 07:36.789
-I have no fear of going by myself.
-It is not about your fear, Harald.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.167
We need at least six rowers,

07:40.626 --> 07:43.004
and we must lessen the weight
of the boat by 50 skippund

07:43.087 --> 07:45.256
or it'll not clear the base of the falls.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.802
Fifty skippund?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.430
So we lose the mast.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.683
The mast weighs maybe 15 skippund.

08:01.856 --> 08:05.568
No. If I lose my furs,
I have no reason to go on.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.739
Then you are just like everyone else.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.639
The trial will start soon.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.350
Where I will be found guilty.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.434
You are guilty.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.063
What were you thinking?

08:42.146 --> 08:43.648
And what are <i>you</i> thinking?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.026
Following a monster
who massacres people while they pray,

08:47.109 --> 08:49.737
instead of the gods
you've trusted all your life?

08:49.820 --> 08:50.863
Things have changed.

08:53.074 --> 08:57.161
No, not things, Mother.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.164
We have changed.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.124
Ready the prisoner.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.587
Please, Jorundr!

09:06.671 --> 09:07.797
Beg for leniency.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.465
For me.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.592
It is your only chance.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.387
Jorundr, please.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.265
Would my father have begged? Hmm?

09:36.409 --> 09:40.079
She is burning with fever.
Get hot water and rags, quickly.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.208
My son. I must get my son…

09:44.792 --> 09:46.294
You must be quiet, Freydis.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.547
You are very ill
and Harekr is looking for you.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.883
He has my son. In Jomsborg.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.885
-I must go back. I must get him…

09:55.553 --> 09:57.054
I am going to help you.

09:58.723 --> 10:02.184
You must bite on this
and try to remain silent.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.441
All right.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.198
Thank you. You may go.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.244
Princess Gytha.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.375
-Earl Godwin.
-Do you know where I might find the queen?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.338
In Winchester, I believe.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.798
She has gone to attend
to one of her properties.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.260
-When was this trip planned?
-I would not know.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.388
I offered to accompany her,
but she refused.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.808
She only took
a small group of guards and Agnarr.

10:44.060 --> 10:44.894
Agnarr?

10:59.825 --> 11:00.951
Are you lost?

11:07.249 --> 11:08.292
Do I look lost?

11:10.795 --> 11:11.796
Not at all.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.257
I am, uh, looking for someone.

11:23.849 --> 11:24.767
Nothing.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.074
-Are these edible?
-No!

11:41.617 --> 11:42.451
It's poisonous.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.790
Then why are you picking them?

11:48.999 --> 11:51.711
I am preparing to face a new enemy.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.339
Pain.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.216
Hmm.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.718
How bad is it?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.470
I am still able to manage it.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.974
But one day I may not.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.566
-What are these called?
-Atropa.

12:14.358 --> 12:17.069
Atropa? Like the goddess of fate?

12:17.778 --> 12:18.988
The oldest one.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.700
-The inflexible one.
-Hmm.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.871
It was Atropos
who chose the way a mortal dies.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.791
And cuts the thread of life.

12:34.837 --> 12:38.299
Do not worry about me, Leif Eriksson.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.303
-I know what is coming.
-No, you don't.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.262
I do.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.807
Nothing surprises me.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.810
Friends.

13:31.519 --> 13:35.648
We are gathered here
for the trial of Jorundr Torvilsson,

13:38.275 --> 13:41.612
who is charged
with the most terrible crime of murder.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.617
He's summoned here
before the gods to speak the truth.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.994
I'm not afraid of the truth.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.581
Did you take food to Freydis
the night of her disappearance?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.251
You know I did.

13:56.502 --> 14:00.506
And later,
did you remove her body from the temple,

14:01.006 --> 14:04.176
wrapping it in a blanket,
placing it in a cart?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.972
-I did, but she was not dead.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.310
Is this the blanket you used
to take her away from us?

14:20.609 --> 14:22.152
That is from the child birth.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.406
Auor. Come, child.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.915
In the morning after Freydis disappeared,

14:34.999 --> 14:36.625
what did you find in the temple?

14:37.459 --> 14:41.881
The priestess was gone,
but I found a knife on the ground

14:42.631 --> 14:44.675
with blood on it.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.511
Freydis was given
a knife for the childbirth.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.475
Is this the knife you found?

14:55.144 --> 14:55.978
Yes.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.314
Good.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.486
Is this your knife?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.072
It is.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.285
But I didn't use it on Freydis
and you know it.

15:12.202 --> 15:15.289
No, I do not know it.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.750
-I didn't kill her.
-You did kill her!

15:17.833 --> 15:21.462
And then you took her body
to the boneyard where we found this!

15:28.302 --> 15:31.972
Oh, wise ones,
we have a killer in our midst!

15:32.973 --> 15:35.893
If he strikes once, he will strike again!

15:37.186 --> 15:41.231
We must rid ourselves of this evil.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.865
I await your judgment.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.661
Mother, don't.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.080
Please.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.623
Have mercy on him.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.919
I'm begging you.
He's my only child!

16:08.300 --> 16:09.134
Please.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.103
We have decided.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.272
He is guilty.

16:27.027 --> 16:27.987
His hand.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.907
His necklace.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.994
And exile.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.329
Row!

18:25.646 --> 18:27.981
Explain to me this science

18:28.065 --> 18:31.610
that requires
the weight of the boat to be reduced

18:31.693 --> 18:33.821
in order to make it over the falls.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.243
It is a science of the mind.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.996
Really?

18:44.248 --> 18:48.877
Mmm-hmm. No one wants to die.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.216
But we are loathe to risk death
in order to survive,

18:56.218 --> 18:58.095
until we have no choice.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.766
Harald doesn't understand this.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.728
I presented him with a situation…

19:09.690 --> 19:13.026
for him to feel
what he's asking others to do.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.530
Sacrifice.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.659
Everybody has to risk something.

19:22.953 --> 19:23.787
Why not Harald?

19:29.710 --> 19:30.752
Will he do it?

19:31.837 --> 19:33.005
That I don't know.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.196
Leif?

19:58.488 --> 19:59.489
Hmm.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.120
I don't want to die.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.187
I did not think
you would be one of those to desert me.

20:33.148 --> 20:36.068
I'd have thought
you'd be faithful to your father's wishes.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.028
I did not say I wouldn't.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.949
I said I can understand

20:43.575 --> 20:45.202
why the others are reluctant.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.882
Freedom and love
are strong emotions to overcome,

21:01.009 --> 21:03.011
especially when you've never known them.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.556
I would've thought
the threat of savagery and torture

21:06.640 --> 21:08.558
would help make their decision easier.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.394
It would.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.106
But not till it shows itself.

21:15.691 --> 21:19.278
When your father came to me,
he knew about the Pechenegs.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.573
And yet he was brave enough
to make the journey.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.411
That is because
he feared something else more.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.589
When I was a girl,
raiders invaded Chude from Novgorod…

21:41.717 --> 21:42.926
and killed hundreds.

21:44.177 --> 21:47.723
My aunts and cousins
fled to the rivers with their belongings

21:47.806 --> 21:50.058
to avoid robbery and rape.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.438
Many drowned.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.024
To stop the suffering,

21:57.941 --> 22:00.068
my father journeyed to Constantinople

22:00.152 --> 22:01.570
and met with the emperor.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.451
He negotiated an end to the raids

22:08.201 --> 22:10.162
in return for a great tribute.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.876
That is why
he was returning to Constantinople,

22:17.878 --> 22:19.004
to pay for that peace.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.969
This pendant must be extremely valuable

22:26.928 --> 22:28.847
if it's enough to save a kingdom.

22:31.141 --> 22:31.975
It is.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.688
And you are a very strong woman

22:37.814 --> 22:39.649
to deliver on your father's promise.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.580
I'm looking for a man called the Bear.

22:55.415 --> 22:56.500
Are you now?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.419
Do you know where he is?

22:59.503 --> 23:02.089
That depends.

23:12.974 --> 23:13.934
Not on that.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.187
Then on what?

23:18.230 --> 23:21.066
On who exactly is asking.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.411
-The ale-wife knows something.
-Yes?

23:32.494 --> 23:34.246
She would not tell me.

23:34.913 --> 23:35.914
Why not?

23:35.997 --> 23:38.875
I said I was inquiring
on behalf of the Queen of England.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.254
She laughed. Said she would
only tell the queen herself.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.518
I present to you
Her Royal Highness,

23:56.601 --> 23:59.146
-the Queen of England.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.064
Do you now?

24:01.940 --> 24:03.108
He does.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.989
I understand you can help me.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.202
I knew Godwin as a child.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.956
The large family house
was only two miles from here.

24:18.874 --> 24:19.875
It was grand.

24:21.585 --> 24:25.046
Back then, all the children
played in the fields together.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.424
He was a sweet boy.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.345
His father's betrayal changed everything.

24:32.429 --> 24:36.725
Losing his home, his title, his wealth,

24:37.476 --> 24:41.313
dealing with the shame of it,
it made him angry and bitter.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.817
But the Bear was always loyal to him.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.195
The Bear knew Godwin?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.447
He was Godwin's guardian.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.995
His mother died
shortly after his father's imprisonment,

24:57.078 --> 24:58.455
so the Bear took him in.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.292
He was all he had, after all was lost.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.879
What is his real name? The Bear?

25:07.422 --> 25:08.507
John Fletcher.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.926
He was the old ealdorman's retainer.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.678
He would do anything for the boy.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.232
Ealdorman Wulfhaere!

25:27.067 --> 25:28.401
What brings you to London?

25:28.485 --> 25:30.237
You, Earl Godwin.

25:33.532 --> 25:37.285
-Should I be worried about my estate?
-I don't know. Should you be?

25:37.911 --> 25:39.496
I saw the queen in Sussex.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.709
I trust she is not planning
on taking some or all of it from me

25:45.293 --> 25:46.503
and giving it to a Viking?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.342
Earl Godwin, I speak in jest.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.012
I trust
that if the queen was about to depose me,

25:56.096 --> 25:58.431
you would have
at least given me some warning.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.309
And I jest with you. Fear not.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.312
The queen has other business in Sussex.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.283
A good try, King Svein.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.994
We'll find you another deer.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.587
They left before the thaw?

26:30.088 --> 26:31.715
On a boat on a sled.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.719
Filled with furs
to sell in Constantinople?

26:36.428 --> 26:37.804
I think you're lying to me.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.723
If I was lying,

26:39.806 --> 26:41.975
I would have
made the story more believable.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.394
Extraordinary.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.272
My brother, the great Viking berserker,

26:47.355 --> 26:49.024
now a fur trader.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.610
No less amazing
than the great Olaf Haraldsson,

26:51.693 --> 26:53.820
architect of
King Canute's London invasion,

26:53.903 --> 26:55.530
now the guardian of his son.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.532
We have an arrangement.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.994
I look after
his northern empire and Svein,

27:01.077 --> 27:03.830
in exchange
for the life of my own son, Magnus,

27:04.497 --> 27:05.874
who he raises in his court.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.292
Brilliant.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.212
That depends on who you ask.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.263
With the southern trade routes closed,

27:20.347 --> 27:23.183
it is important
that you keep the Baltic open for trade.

27:23.850 --> 27:27.854
That means controlling the Jomsvikings
who are now raiding our ships.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.649
I ran into them a few months ago.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.653
Trust me. I will find them
and get rid of them once and for all.

27:38.281 --> 27:42.744
Was there a woman with Harald
or did he mention one to you?

27:44.204 --> 27:45.038
A woman?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.083
Not to me. Why?

27:50.752 --> 27:51.586
Nothing.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.307
Freydis.

28:08.645 --> 28:12.107
-Where is my son?
-Freydis. You are all right.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.525
It is me, Valgerda.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.986
How did I get here?

28:17.570 --> 28:19.322
Hrefna found you in the boneyard.

28:31.626 --> 28:34.504
Some of the afterbirth
was still in your body,

28:35.422 --> 28:37.006
and I was able to remove it.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.218
And you will be fine,

28:41.928 --> 28:44.347
but you will never
be able to have another child.

29:32.228 --> 29:34.647
I cannot guarantee anyone's survival.

29:37.358 --> 29:40.069
What is over the falls, I do not know.

29:42.405 --> 29:45.074
I can only guarantee
my best efforts to keep us alive.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.162
And I cannot do that if we remain here.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.304
Ready! And up!

30:51.975 --> 30:53.101
Now heave!

31:48.781 --> 31:50.700
He's not dead long.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.661
There is no sign of a wound.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.292
A grand ring…

32:01.085 --> 32:01.920
for a farmer.

32:22.565 --> 32:23.775
From your mother.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.947
Jorundr, why would you do this?

32:29.739 --> 32:31.240
I didn't kill her.

32:33.368 --> 32:37.705
I was trying to save her.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.375
Think about it, Kolr!

32:40.959 --> 32:43.002
Harekr wanted her dead.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.589
She threatened him.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.632
So did I.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.427
So he used me to get rid of us both.

32:55.723 --> 32:58.851
And he will kill anyone
to maintain his power.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.145
Today, it is me.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.900
Tomorrow, it can be any of you.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.286
I'm sorry.

33:24.961 --> 33:25.962
Move out.

33:29.882 --> 33:30.717
To your oars!

33:31.801 --> 33:32.635
Pull!

33:45.398 --> 33:46.816
The massacre was my fault.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.486
I'm sorry. And I'm leaving.

33:51.070 --> 33:53.823
-Where are you going?
-To get my son.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.367
Harekr will never let you have him.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.828
Then I will kill him
or he will have to kill me.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.874
It is the best I could find.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.258
It is good enough for my needs.

35:31.587 --> 35:32.755
Leave us.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.017
Surprise.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.077
This man,

36:04.996 --> 36:05.872
the Bear.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.375
Were there signs
that he had been murdered?

36:14.881 --> 36:15.715
No.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.012
But I'm sure Godwin was behind it

36:21.095 --> 36:23.222
as well as the false assassination attempt

36:23.306 --> 36:24.473
to gain your gratitude.

36:25.766 --> 36:29.061
I do not put such things
beyond the imagination of Godwin.

36:30.479 --> 36:31.522
What about Aelfwynn?

36:33.232 --> 36:36.277
He wrote me
to ask my permission to wed her.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.445
I said yes.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.323
Why would he create a situation

36:40.406 --> 36:43.910
that would lead to his betrothed
being tortured to death?

36:45.411 --> 36:47.330
What could he possibly gain from that?

36:48.039 --> 36:49.248
I do not know.

36:51.417 --> 36:53.044
But I'm sure there was a reason.

36:55.504 --> 36:58.674
Were you sure when you had her killed?

37:01.135 --> 37:01.969
No.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.390
I am not saying
that you are wrong, my love.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.603
But Godwin is a complex man

37:11.646 --> 37:13.606
who has endured great losses

37:14.440 --> 37:16.150
and found a way to survive.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.657
This is not proof of the crimes
that you accuse him of.

37:23.532 --> 37:27.161
And now
he has lost something much greater,

37:27.245 --> 37:29.205
which cannot be returned.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.420
Love.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.265
-King Canute.
-Sire.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.560
Your Highness, welcome home.

37:51.644 --> 37:52.853
I heard from your soldiers

37:52.937 --> 37:55.356
just how resounding your victory was
against the Wends.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.734
I am not the only one
who has been keeping England safe.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.822
The queen tells me
that you saved her life while I was away.

38:04.573 --> 38:05.533
I am grateful.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.287
She also told me about your betrothed.

38:11.080 --> 38:11.914
Aelfwynn.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.751
The queen had no choice,
but to act the way she did.

38:15.835 --> 38:19.672
I acknowledge that.
But it does not ease my pain.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.008
I understand.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.093
In my experience,

38:25.219 --> 38:27.471
the best way to forget about a great woman

38:28.097 --> 38:30.558
is to find another who is superior.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.728
You should be married.

38:34.228 --> 38:37.273
If it pleases the king,
I shall try to find a suitable bride.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.275
I already have.

38:40.693 --> 38:44.905
I have decided
that you should become part of my family.

38:46.907 --> 38:51.370
Gytha, my niece,
would make a most wonderful wife.

38:52.913 --> 38:53.831
Your Highness…

38:57.209 --> 38:58.502
words escape me.

38:58.586 --> 38:59.712
Then say nothing.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.757
You have my blessing.

39:06.719 --> 39:10.181
My queen, we have cause for celebration.

39:11.974 --> 39:14.352
Godwin is to marry Gytha.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.607
Gytha…

39:20.775 --> 39:22.151
I am so sorry.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.820
Why are you sorry, Your Highness?

39:25.404 --> 39:27.698
-You're glad?
-How could I not be?

39:29.200 --> 39:32.912
I'm going to marry the kindest,
most loving man in all of England.

39:32.995 --> 39:34.830
How can you think that?

39:34.914 --> 39:36.123
Aelfwynn told me.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.628
If he could love me
even half as much as he loved her,

39:40.711 --> 39:42.588
I would be a lucky woman.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.175
But Gytha, you are of a royal line.

39:47.843 --> 39:48.803
You're right.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.972
At least there is one thing
I can give him that she could not.

39:52.765 --> 39:53.808
And what is that?

39:53.891 --> 39:57.561
Aelfwynn said it was Godwin's dream
to have a son who would be king.

39:58.979 --> 40:01.565
She could not. But I can.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.569
Gytha! Where are you?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.321
Coming.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.672
Harekr!

40:27.925 --> 40:28.968
Harekr!

40:32.888 --> 40:33.722
Freydis.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.561
Harekr!

40:40.813 --> 40:42.022
She wants her baby.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.651
But she's dead.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.404
You said she's dead.

40:48.487 --> 40:49.405
Harekr!

40:49.488 --> 40:51.991
Maybe it's her spirit. Pray to her.

40:52.074 --> 40:55.119
-No, no, this is a trick.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.122
We must find who is doing it
and punish them.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.166
-Harekr!
-She is here!

41:00.791 --> 41:03.502
She is outside the gates. Open them.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.006
The gates! Open the gates!

41:18.517 --> 41:19.435
It's her!

41:19.935 --> 41:21.979
It is! It is Freydis!

41:22.062 --> 41:23.272
It's Freydis!

41:39.455 --> 41:40.414
Freydis,

41:41.957 --> 41:43.292
we thought you were dead!

41:44.502 --> 41:46.045
Come. Let us help you.

41:46.128 --> 41:48.047
You cannot help me, Harekr.

41:49.673 --> 41:51.425
You are the cause of my pain.

41:53.135 --> 41:56.096
You have taken my son and I want him back!

41:56.972 --> 42:00.100
We are taking care of him, Freydis.
We only want what's best for him.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.102
I am what's best for him!

42:02.186 --> 42:03.896
Any mother will tell you that.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.398
I'm taking him back.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.693
That's not going to happen.

42:13.656 --> 42:14.949
Are you challenging me?

42:16.367 --> 42:17.243
No.

42:18.744 --> 42:21.997
It would not be fair in your condition.
Come to the temple to recover.

42:24.124 --> 42:27.211
Let the gods decide
what is fair and unfair.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.883
Yes, let the gods decide.

42:33.592 --> 42:37.555
-We must trust in the gods!
-You have Odin on your side.

42:37.638 --> 42:38.472
All right.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.060
If you wish to fight me, Freydis,

42:45.229 --> 42:46.146
I am ready.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.794
Take her to the temple.

43:10.170 --> 43:11.213
No.

43:17.469 --> 43:19.096
I will kill you if I must.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.723
Then do it.

43:21.932 --> 43:23.517
I will not give up my son.

44:09.521 --> 44:10.397
No!

44:19.740 --> 44:20.574
No.

44:32.294 --> 44:34.213
-Stop it. I order--

44:37.591 --> 44:40.511
-Stop!

44:50.729 --> 44:52.648
-Evil one!
-Traitor!

44:56.318 --> 44:57.486
He stole a child!

45:01.657 --> 45:02.866
-Kill him!
-Yes!

45:04.743 --> 45:06.412
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

45:07.246 --> 45:08.330
Kill him!

46:12.770 --> 46:13.645
Here.

46:15.689 --> 46:17.566
-All right.
-What about you?

46:18.400 --> 46:19.234
Don't worry.

46:21.570 --> 46:22.905
We're doing this together.

46:33.665 --> 46:34.666
Ropes ready.

46:35.542 --> 46:36.376
Push off!

46:55.938 --> 46:58.565
Row! And row!

47:00.234 --> 47:01.443
Row!

47:01.527 --> 47:05.864
And row! Row!

47:17.376 --> 47:18.919
And faster!

47:39.147 --> 47:40.482
Oars in!
