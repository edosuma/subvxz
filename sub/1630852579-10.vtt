WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:04.578
NARRATOR: Extraordinary
accounts of missing time.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.731
BRUCE GERNON:
Once the aircraft
penetrated the tunnel,

00:07.824 --> 00:10.417
time started changing instantly.

00:10.569 --> 00:13.070
It only took three minutes
and 20 seconds

00:13.088 --> 00:15.739
to fly a hundred miles.

00:15.832 --> 00:19.334
NARRATOR:
Otherworldly events
that seem to alter reality.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.854
JOHN BURROUGHS:
It seemed like everything
was going in slow motion,

00:22.005 --> 00:23.355
like everything
was slowing down.

00:23.582 --> 00:25.691
NARRATOR:
Sightings of strange craft

00:25.842 --> 00:28.602
changing location
instantaneously.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.770
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
These vehicles are able

00:29.864 --> 00:32.589
to pop in and pop out

00:32.608 --> 00:36.684
of either time
or another dimension.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.612
NARRATOR:
Could extraterrestrials

00:38.706 --> 00:42.207
have mastered the ability
to travel through time?

00:42.359 --> 00:46.879
Is Earth being visited not only
by entities from other planets

00:47.106 --> 00:52.551
but also from the future,
or even the distant past?

00:52.702 --> 00:55.054
Perhaps an alien civilization
in outer space,

00:55.281 --> 00:57.705
thousands of years
more advanced than us,

00:57.800 --> 00:59.808
may be able to time travel.

01:03.972 --> 01:06.065
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:06.216 --> 01:09.050
in the universe.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.862
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:13.632 --> 01:15.649
It demands
we question everything

01:15.801 --> 01:17.984
we have ever been taught.

01:18.079 --> 01:22.081
The evidence is all around us.

01:22.308 --> 01:25.733
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:25.828 --> 01:28.403
We are not alone.

01:28.497 --> 01:31.840
We have never been alone.

01:42.436 --> 01:46.346
NARRATOR:
Mount Pion, Turkey.

01:46.440 --> 01:51.168
Here, where the ancient Greek
city of Ephesus once stood,

01:51.261 --> 01:53.261
lie the ruins
of a religious site

01:53.280 --> 01:56.356
known as the grotto
of the Seven Sleepers.

01:56.508 --> 01:59.284
The grotto is thought
to be the location

01:59.436 --> 02:01.286
where, many centuries ago,

02:01.513 --> 02:06.959
a group of seven men
experienced a shift in time.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.186
In the Christian
and Islamic story

02:09.279 --> 02:10.963
of the Seven Sleepers
of Ephesus,

02:11.190 --> 02:14.115
we learn the amazing story
of seven warriors

02:14.209 --> 02:17.285
who professed Christianity
in 250 AD,

02:17.304 --> 02:20.097
when it was just beginning
to emerge as a new religion.

02:22.701 --> 02:25.552
The Roman emperor offered
these warriors an opportunity

02:25.704 --> 02:29.297
to recant and to disavow
their Christianity.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.709
Instead, they decide
to sell all their possessions

02:32.728 --> 02:35.803
and go into a cave,
and in response,

02:35.898 --> 02:37.714
the-the emperor decides

02:37.807 --> 02:40.909
to seal this cave
with the Sleepers inside of it.

02:42.738 --> 02:44.721
Several hundred years go by,

02:44.814 --> 02:48.500
and a shepherd
chances upon this cave.

02:48.652 --> 02:49.835
(bleating)

02:51.321 --> 02:56.416
And he breaks down the wall,
and the seven people

02:56.568 --> 02:59.586
inside of the cave have been
sleeping for hundreds of years,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.922
and it's now 300 years later.

03:02.016 --> 03:05.350
And they're still alive,
these Seven Sleepers.

03:06.836 --> 03:08.687
These Sleepers
then go into Ephesus...

03:10.507 --> 03:12.082
...and nothing looks the same.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.341
Something they noticed
is that there are

03:13.360 --> 03:15.585
Christian crosses everywhere,

03:15.604 --> 03:19.773
because by now,
Christianity has taken over.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.608
AMIR HUSSAIN: With the Seven
Sleepers of Ephesus you think,

03:21.702 --> 03:23.368
"Okay, is it that there's
some miracle here,"

03:23.595 --> 03:26.205
or have they been in a place
where the time line,

03:26.356 --> 03:28.356
you know, has-has shifted,
and so,

03:28.450 --> 03:30.767
what seems 300 years to them

03:30.786 --> 03:34.271
has been a much
shorter amount of time.

03:34.289 --> 03:37.699
NARRATOR:
While many scholars
regard this story as fictional,

03:37.718 --> 03:40.126
millions of Christians
and Muslims believe

03:40.279 --> 03:44.038
a true miracle took place,
and that these seven warriors

03:44.132 --> 03:47.133
were transported
into the future.

03:47.228 --> 03:51.379
In fact, hundreds of graves
have been found at the grotto

03:51.398 --> 03:53.623
dating back
to the fifth century,

03:53.717 --> 03:56.551
along with inscriptions
indicating

03:56.645 --> 03:58.720
that people were buried there
because it was considered

03:58.814 --> 04:00.981
a location of great power.

04:01.133 --> 04:04.892
Today, it remains
a popular pilgrimage site,

04:04.912 --> 04:08.580
serving as a testament
to humankind's preoccupation

04:08.807 --> 04:12.066
with one of the most significant
and least understood forces

04:12.086 --> 04:15.903
in the universe: time.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.072
What is time?
That's a great question.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.341
It's a fundamental question.

04:21.153 --> 04:22.986
We all normally live

04:23.079 --> 04:25.655
along the straight line of time,

04:25.749 --> 04:27.599
from the past, present,
to the future.

04:27.826 --> 04:30.418
But the question is,
is there a way around that,

04:30.437 --> 04:32.496
a way to travel through time?

04:32.514 --> 04:36.108
JONATHAN YOUNG:
Time is important to us.

04:36.335 --> 04:38.668
The passage of time
is an item of grief

04:38.762 --> 04:41.171
that we all know is universal.

04:41.264 --> 04:45.617
We have a kind of longing
to defeat time.

04:47.346 --> 04:49.103
HENRY:
Why has time travel
stuck around for so long

04:49.197 --> 04:51.364
in human consciousness?

04:51.458 --> 04:54.518
I think this idea that you can
go into the ancient past

04:54.536 --> 04:57.879
or travel into the future
is the ultimate trip.

05:01.193 --> 05:04.711
NARRATOR:
The notion of breaking free from
the seemingly inescapable bonds

05:04.805 --> 05:09.883
of time has existed in the human
imagination for centuries.

05:10.035 --> 05:13.628
But modern concepts of time
travel are largely credited

05:13.647 --> 05:16.481
to science fiction author
H.G. Wells,

05:16.633 --> 05:20.894
who, in his 1895 book
<i> The Time Machine,</i> speculated

05:21.046 --> 05:25.157
as to how time travel might
be scientifically possible.

05:25.308 --> 05:27.975
MICHIO KAKU: H.G. Wells
began to say to himself,

05:27.995 --> 05:32.664
"If we can move in space,
why can't we move in time?

05:32.891 --> 05:35.792
And that's the beginning
of his novel<i> The Time Machine.</i>

05:37.821 --> 05:40.897
H.G. Wells said it takes
three coordinates

05:40.990 --> 05:43.066
to locate an object in space.

05:43.085 --> 05:46.252
Time, therefore,
is the fourth dimension.

05:46.405 --> 05:48.572
We need four coordinates
to identify

05:48.665 --> 05:50.807
any event in our universe.

05:52.427 --> 05:55.095
ANDREW COLLINS:
H.G. Wells talked about

05:55.189 --> 06:00.174
the idea that space and time
were somehow linked together.

06:00.268 --> 06:04.938
And the protagonist of the book
was able to go, at will,

06:05.032 --> 06:08.700
any time into the future
or any time into the past,

06:08.927 --> 06:12.186
to actually experience
and see what was going on.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.782
NARRATOR:
Could humankind one day
be able to travel back in time

06:15.876 --> 06:19.285
or even into the future?

06:19.438 --> 06:22.530
Incredibly, just a decade
after the publication

06:22.549 --> 06:24.365
of<i> The Time Machine,</i>

06:24.459 --> 06:28.887
Albert Einstein proposed
a similar vision of time travel.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.781
HUGH NEWMAN:
H.G. Wells, in 1895,

06:31.800 --> 06:36.228
mentioned the idea of time
and space being connected.

06:37.881 --> 06:39.898
Now, this is interesting,
because Albert Einstein

06:40.049 --> 06:42.383
came up with
the theory of relativity,

06:42.403 --> 06:47.480
where he also proposed that
time and space are connected.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.984
Time used to be thought of
in Newtonian classical physics

06:51.078 --> 06:52.469
as something absolute.

06:52.562 --> 06:53.987
It didn't change,
it was the same

06:54.139 --> 06:55.229
for everybody everywhere.

06:55.323 --> 06:57.490
Einstein came along in 1905,

06:57.643 --> 06:59.584
published a paper
on special relativity,

06:59.736 --> 07:02.504
and demonstrated
that time's actually relative.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.257
Now, in Einstein's theory,

07:05.484 --> 07:07.150
space and time
are linked to each other.

07:07.243 --> 07:08.743
That's why it's called
spacetime.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.322
Whatever you do to space
also happens to time.

07:12.340 --> 07:15.917
A rotating black hole
can cause a twisting of space.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.511
Time is linked to space.

07:18.664 --> 07:22.607
So if I'm twisting space,
I can twist time.

07:22.834 --> 07:25.444
Mathematically,
this has been shown.

07:25.671 --> 07:28.530
I can travel from the future
back into the past.

07:31.176 --> 07:34.678
We haven't been able
to do it yet experimentally,

07:34.771 --> 07:35.937
but it's a real part
of Einstein's

07:35.956 --> 07:37.456
general theory of relativity.

07:39.017 --> 07:41.017
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that spacetime

07:41.110 --> 07:44.796
can be manipulated
to travel into the past?

07:44.948 --> 07:47.799
And if so,
how close is modern science

07:48.026 --> 07:50.969
to achieving
such an incredible feat?

07:52.714 --> 07:56.624
The University
of Connecticut, 2021.

07:56.643 --> 08:01.054
Theoretical physicist
and professor Dr. Ronald Mallett

08:01.148 --> 08:04.057
works closely with a team
of researchers on a project

08:04.151 --> 08:06.467
to realize his lifelong dream:

08:06.561 --> 08:10.322
the creation of a time machine.

08:10.549 --> 08:13.307
By using a mechanism
called a ring laser,

08:13.327 --> 08:17.144
Dr. Mallett believes that he can
manipulate the fabric of space

08:17.164 --> 08:20.957
and time to create a door
that can open to the past.

08:23.228 --> 08:24.561
MALLETT:
What I did was I solved

08:24.579 --> 08:27.247
Einstein's gravitational
field equations,

08:27.341 --> 08:30.491
and I was able to show
that a circulating beam

08:30.511 --> 08:33.903
of laser light will cause
a twisting of space.

08:33.922 --> 08:37.757
There is a device,
it's called a ring laser.

08:37.909 --> 08:40.744
All it is is a device
that causes light

08:40.762 --> 08:42.428
to move around in a loop.

08:42.581 --> 08:44.097
You can get it to do that
in a number of different ways.

08:44.249 --> 08:46.583
Bouncing it off mirrors,
for example.

08:46.676 --> 08:50.028
And I was able to show
that a circulating beam

08:50.255 --> 08:53.273
of laser light will cause
a twisting of space.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.276
What I was able to show further
is that if this twisting

08:56.428 --> 08:58.537
of space was strong enough,

08:58.764 --> 09:01.689
it could lead to time
being twisted into a loop.

09:01.783 --> 09:04.191
And these loops in time
could allow for the possibility

09:04.286 --> 09:06.102
of time travel in the past.

09:06.195 --> 09:08.029
This is all anchored
in Einstein's

09:08.048 --> 09:09.548
general theory of relativity.

09:11.367 --> 09:13.610
NARRATOR:
While Dr. Mallett's time machine

09:13.628 --> 09:15.612
may be theoretically sound,

09:15.705 --> 09:18.056
one major hurdle
stands in his way:

09:18.283 --> 09:22.043
harnessing massive amounts
of energy.

09:22.137 --> 09:23.395
MICHAEL DENNIN:
The real constraint

09:23.546 --> 09:24.971
with a time machine
at the moment

09:25.065 --> 09:27.232
is the energy involved,
because you have to bend

09:27.383 --> 09:28.817
the dimension that's time.

09:30.145 --> 09:33.572
KAKU:
The energy at which
you can create

09:33.799 --> 09:37.467
a gateway through space and time
is called the Planck energy.

09:37.485 --> 09:41.079
The Planck energy
is a quadrillion times

09:41.306 --> 09:43.915
more powerful than
our most powerful machine,

09:44.067 --> 09:45.917
the Large Hadron Collider.

09:48.313 --> 09:51.089
We're talking about
the energy of a star.

09:51.240 --> 09:54.000
Perhaps an alien civilization
in outer space,

09:54.152 --> 09:57.170
thousands of years
more advanced than us,

09:57.322 --> 09:59.989
may be able to access
the Planck energy.

10:00.008 --> 10:02.934
That cannot be ruled out.

10:03.161 --> 10:05.920
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrial
civilizations

10:06.014 --> 10:09.833
have the technology to traverse
the vast distances of space,

10:09.926 --> 10:12.685
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

10:12.838 --> 10:14.854
might they have also
mastered the ability

10:15.006 --> 10:16.740
to travel through time?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.934
Perhaps further clues
can be found

10:19.953 --> 10:23.121
by examining incredible stories
of time travel

10:23.272 --> 10:26.374
found in some of the earliest
texts ever written.

10:36.285 --> 10:39.696
NARRATOR:
After a record-breaking 340 days

10:39.789 --> 10:42.048
abord the International
Space Station,

10:42.142 --> 10:47.203
astronaut Scott Kelly returns to
the NASA Johnson Space Center.

10:47.222 --> 10:50.056
The mission was designed
to help researchers

10:50.150 --> 10:52.984
understand the effects
of long-term spaceflight

10:53.136 --> 10:54.969
on the human body.

10:55.063 --> 10:59.824
Scott's identical twin brother
and former astronaut Mark Kelly

10:59.976 --> 11:03.161
remained on Earth to serve
as the control subject.

11:04.406 --> 11:05.980
While Scott was in space,

11:05.999 --> 11:08.149
his immune system
was more active,

11:08.243 --> 11:10.410
his vision deteriorated

11:10.562 --> 11:13.897
and he lost more bone mass
compared to Mark.

11:13.915 --> 11:15.489
But perhaps
the most significant difference

11:15.509 --> 11:20.253
was that for Scott,
time had slowed down.

11:20.405 --> 11:25.241
When they measured the aging
acceleration of Scott Kelly

11:25.334 --> 11:28.578
and Mark Kelly, the twins,
it turns out

11:28.671 --> 11:35.418
that Scott was 0.5 milliseconds
younger than Mark.

11:35.511 --> 11:38.922
And so, what's going on here?

11:38.940 --> 11:42.683
TRAVIS TAYLOR:
So, that actually fits
with time dilation.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.611
It's a phenomenon that
we have observed to be real,

11:45.764 --> 11:48.264
that the closer you go
to the speed of light,

11:48.357 --> 11:49.874
the more time
slows down for you.

11:51.603 --> 11:52.952
KAKU:
According to Einstein's theory

11:53.046 --> 11:54.713
of special relativity,

11:54.940 --> 11:58.791
the faster you move,
the slower time gets.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.720
So, if you have a telescope
and could look inside

12:01.947 --> 12:04.464
a rocket ship speeding
near the speed of light,

12:04.616 --> 12:08.393
everyone inside that rocket
would be frozen,

12:08.544 --> 12:11.378
moving at a different rate
in time.

12:11.398 --> 12:15.549
Given that the space station
orbits around the planet Earth

12:15.643 --> 12:18.737
at about 17,500 miles per hour,

12:18.964 --> 12:21.814
you can actually calculate
how slow time must be

12:21.908 --> 12:24.558
on the space station.

12:24.652 --> 12:28.229
And so, we can actually measure
this effect in the laboratory.

12:28.323 --> 12:31.474
MALLETT:
Imagine, in the future,
when we have rockets that can go

12:31.493 --> 12:33.251
close to the speed of light.

12:33.478 --> 12:36.479
They could find that days,
maybe years had passed

12:36.572 --> 12:38.664
for the people
on board the rocket.

12:38.817 --> 12:40.925
But when they come back,
they would find out

12:41.152 --> 12:43.152
that decades had passed
here on the Earth.

12:43.246 --> 12:45.171
They could come back and find

12:45.265 --> 12:48.825
that they are younger
than their children.

12:48.918 --> 12:51.436
Time travel
to the future is real.

12:51.663 --> 12:54.773
We've seen the baby steps of it.
But it has happened.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.760
NARRATOR:
If space travel
has revealed to humankind

12:59.780 --> 13:02.930
the possibilities that exist
for manipulating time,

13:02.949 --> 13:04.616
is it possible that somewhere

13:04.843 --> 13:06.934
in the vast expanse
of the universe,

13:06.953 --> 13:10.363
other intelligent beings
have advanced to the point

13:10.515 --> 13:13.875
where they are able to move
through time as easily as space?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.613
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe evidence can be found

13:19.633 --> 13:22.191
in ancient texts
that our ancestors

13:22.285 --> 13:23.876
may have already witnessed

13:24.029 --> 13:27.305
or even experienced
the bending of time.

13:27.456 --> 13:29.699
YOUNG: There's this
wonderful book of stories,

13:29.717 --> 13:33.478
an epic in Hindu culture,
the<i> Mahabharata,</i>

13:33.629 --> 13:36.039
written in the third century
before the Common Era,

13:36.132 --> 13:38.149
but this was writing down
oral traditions

13:38.301 --> 13:40.226
that were much,
much older than that.

13:40.378 --> 13:42.987
And one of the tales
is when King Raivata

13:43.139 --> 13:45.548
goes up into the heavens
and meets God,

13:45.641 --> 13:49.052
the great creator god
Brahma himself.

13:49.145 --> 13:54.740
TSOUKALOS:
King Raivata was actually taken
into the heavens in a chariot

13:54.835 --> 13:59.671
to visit this gigantic palace
that was in the celestial realm.

13:59.822 --> 14:04.567
And when King Raivata came back,
much to his surprise,

14:04.586 --> 14:07.904
he did not recognize
a single person

14:07.997 --> 14:09.681
that was in his neighborhood.

14:09.908 --> 14:12.925
In fact, it turns out
that he had returned

14:13.019 --> 14:15.912
hundreds of years later.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.939
Now, how is such
a thing even possible?

14:19.675 --> 14:20.674
CHILDRESS:
Here we have

14:20.768 --> 14:22.768
what is perhaps the first story

14:22.863 --> 14:24.863
of time dilation,

14:25.014 --> 14:28.182
where someone has
gone up into space,

14:28.276 --> 14:33.613
in, say, a spaceship,
and all this time has passed.

14:33.765 --> 14:38.376
Which is exactly what Einstein
had talked about in 1905.

14:38.527 --> 14:41.671
Only, this is a story
from thousands of years ago.

14:43.958 --> 14:47.293
NARRATOR:
Could King Raivata's experience
be a historical account

14:47.387 --> 14:49.445
of a time dilation event

14:49.538 --> 14:53.116
that occurred
thousands of years ago?

14:53.209 --> 14:55.209
For ancient astronaut theorists,

14:55.303 --> 14:57.637
this possibility
is made stronger

14:57.731 --> 15:00.214
when considering the fact
that similar stories

15:00.233 --> 15:02.400
were told in other parts
of the world--

15:02.627 --> 15:05.904
like in Egypt,
where ancient hieroglyphs

15:06.131 --> 15:10.891
describe a celestial craft
called the solar barge of Ra.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.970
TSOUKALOS:
There are many references
in ancient Egypt

15:14.063 --> 15:18.917
about Ra's solar barge,
which was this vehicle

15:19.144 --> 15:23.421
that they described
that they saw cross the sky.

15:23.572 --> 15:28.760
This solar barge is also known
as the Ship of a Million Years.

15:28.911 --> 15:33.823
NARRATOR:
According to an ancient document
known as the Turin King List,

15:33.916 --> 15:36.659
which contains a record
of all Egyptian rulers

15:36.678 --> 15:39.270
up until 1300 BC,

15:39.497 --> 15:42.256
the earliest pharaohs
lived for hundreds

15:42.350 --> 15:45.259
or even thousands of years.

15:45.353 --> 15:47.837
These were the pharaohs
who were said to have journeyed

15:47.930 --> 15:51.007
to the stars
on the solar barge of Ra.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.526
HUSSAIN: You look
at some of these records

15:53.678 --> 15:55.344
from the Egyptians
and you think,

15:55.363 --> 15:57.288
well, okay,
if there is this phenomenon

15:57.515 --> 16:00.700
of time dilation, if these
pharaohs really are travelling

16:00.852 --> 16:04.963
on craft at very high speeds,
then when they come back,

16:05.190 --> 16:07.690
they're still young,
the Earth has aged tremendously,

16:07.709 --> 16:10.543
and so, is that part of it?

16:10.695 --> 16:14.121
Is that how you have pharaohs
that lived hundreds of years?

16:14.140 --> 16:16.957
You see this effect
that we now call time dilation

16:17.051 --> 16:19.385
in various ancient cultures.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.981
TSOUKALOS:
There is an artifact
at the Ashmolean Museum

16:23.208 --> 16:24.724
in Oxford, England
that is called

16:24.876 --> 16:30.546
the WB44 Kings List
of ancient Sumeria.

16:30.639 --> 16:33.883
It lists the exact
reigning periods

16:33.901 --> 16:37.144
of all the kings
of ancient Sumeria.

16:37.238 --> 16:43.893
The total is 266,000 years,

16:43.911 --> 16:46.896
and there are
crazy reigning periods

16:46.989 --> 16:49.749
that are recorded
very specifically,

16:49.843 --> 16:55.254
and I think they knew perfectly
well how to record time.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.349
HUSSAIN:
You have these figures
in the Bible

16:58.501 --> 17:00.518
that live for hundreds
of-of years.

17:00.669 --> 17:04.764
The oldest figure
in the Bible is Methuselah,

17:04.858 --> 17:07.025
the grandfather of Noah,

17:07.252 --> 17:10.653
and he dies, the Bible tells us,
the age of 969.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.423
NARRATOR:
According to the Hebrew Bible,

17:14.442 --> 17:16.517
Methuselah's father Enoch

17:16.536 --> 17:18.778
left the Earth
in a fiery chariot,

17:18.872 --> 17:22.114
and was 365 years old

17:22.208 --> 17:26.693
when God chose for him
to remain in the heavenly realm.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.530
All other pre-flood Patriarchs

17:29.549 --> 17:34.201
are recorded as living
for more than 700 years.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.113
CHILDRESS:
Certainly one way
that they would be able to have

17:37.131 --> 17:40.224
these incredibly extended
lives would be

17:40.376 --> 17:42.376
that they are traveling
through space

17:42.395 --> 17:45.471
and coming back and therefore,

17:45.623 --> 17:48.733
400, 900 years can go by,

17:48.960 --> 17:52.195
and-and t-that's essentially
their age on Earth.

17:53.481 --> 17:54.980
TSOUKALOS:
These concepts

17:55.133 --> 17:58.076
should not be described
by our ancestors

17:58.303 --> 18:02.138
because it should have exceeded
their knowledge at the time,

18:02.156 --> 18:05.308
but the fact
that multiple stories exist

18:05.401 --> 18:08.086
where someone wakes up
or gets returned

18:08.313 --> 18:12.148
hundreds of years
after certain events...

18:12.166 --> 18:13.925
that's strange.

18:16.654 --> 18:18.988
NARRATOR:
Could these stories
be historical accounts

18:19.006 --> 18:22.100
of ancient people
experiencing time dilation

18:22.327 --> 18:26.270
after traveling
aboard alien spacecraft?

18:26.422 --> 18:30.090
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

18:30.184 --> 18:33.836
and suggest other accounts,
both ancient and modern,

18:33.929 --> 18:36.339
may reveal
that extraterrestrials

18:36.432 --> 18:38.599
have the ability
to manipulate time

18:38.618 --> 18:41.911
in even more extraordinary ways.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.707
NARRATOR:
Royal Air Force Wing Commander
Sir Robert Victor Goddard

18:54.859 --> 18:58.285
is dispatched to inspect
an old, disused airfield

18:58.379 --> 19:01.121
near Edinburgh, Scotland.

19:01.141 --> 19:05.034
Sir Robert Victor Goddard
was flying over an airfield

19:05.052 --> 19:07.386
to survey and see
if the airfield could be used

19:07.480 --> 19:09.129
in the future,

19:09.223 --> 19:11.056
and while he's flying over it,
he noticed there's cracks

19:11.209 --> 19:13.542
in the airfield
and there's grass growing up

19:13.561 --> 19:15.469
and cows are eating
the grass and so on.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.655
He's flying home
and he gets kind of lost,

19:17.806 --> 19:19.657
or turned around a bit
in a storm,

19:19.808 --> 19:24.236
so he decides to fly back to
where he was to get a bearing.

19:24.330 --> 19:28.574
On the return journey,
he encountered very strange, uh,

19:28.668 --> 19:31.294
yellow and brown clouds.

19:33.080 --> 19:37.416
Almost like he entered into some
kind of otherworldly portal.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.902
And he came out of there

19:39.995 --> 19:42.755
and found himself
in bright sunlight.

19:42.907 --> 19:45.741
And going over
the same airfield,

19:45.760 --> 19:47.743
everything was renovated.

19:47.762 --> 19:52.415
And there were aircraft
out there on the tarmac.

19:52.508 --> 19:54.358
But they were painted yellow.

19:54.510 --> 19:59.197
And there were people tending
these aircraft dressed in blue.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.182
NARRATOR:
When Goddard landed

20:02.202 --> 20:04.202
and told his colleagues
what he saw,

20:04.353 --> 20:07.020
they insisted
it was not possible,

20:07.040 --> 20:10.691
since RAF planes were
painted silver at that time

20:10.710 --> 20:13.544
and mechanics' uniforms
were tan-colored.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.623
However, just a few years later,

20:17.775 --> 20:21.126
the RAF changed the color
of both their training planes

20:21.279 --> 20:24.388
and mechanics uniforms,
which Goddard witnessed

20:24.540 --> 20:29.468
when he flew over
Drem airfield again in 1939.

20:29.620 --> 20:33.880
He's making
another flight and realizes,

20:33.975 --> 20:37.050
"There are the planes, at Drem.

20:37.144 --> 20:39.070
"They are painting them yellow.

20:39.221 --> 20:42.406
The people have on
blue uniforms."

20:42.633 --> 20:46.469
It is exactly
what he remembered seeing

20:46.487 --> 20:49.580
when he came out
from beyond this yellow cloud

20:49.732 --> 20:53.734
four years before in 1935.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.995
COLLINS:
Some people have suggested

20:56.147 --> 20:58.572
that Victor Goddard's experience

20:58.591 --> 21:01.926
could be extraterrestrial
in nature, and that, just maybe,

21:02.077 --> 21:04.320
he was thrust through time

21:04.338 --> 21:09.658
by a yellow and brown cloud
that he encountered.

21:09.677 --> 21:13.679
There are many examples
of these weird clouds

21:13.773 --> 21:17.166
being encountered
in different parts of the world.

21:17.184 --> 21:20.260
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut
theorists propose

21:20.280 --> 21:23.263
that an alien civilization
advanced enough

21:23.357 --> 21:27.192
to achieve interstellar travel
may also possess the technology

21:27.345 --> 21:29.678
to create portals through time.

21:29.697 --> 21:33.032
And they suggest further
evidence that such gateways

21:33.184 --> 21:36.685
have been established
here on Earth can be found

21:36.779 --> 21:39.021
by examining
the extraordinary events

21:39.114 --> 21:43.467
that have occurred
in the Bermuda Triangle.

21:51.052 --> 21:53.719
At 3:00 in the afternoon,

21:53.871 --> 21:56.647
pilot Bruce Gernon
departs from Andros Island

21:56.799 --> 22:00.484
bound for Palm Beach, Florida,
just north of Miami.

22:01.712 --> 22:03.395
It's a route that he's flown

22:03.548 --> 22:06.490
many times before
without incident,

22:06.642 --> 22:10.886
but this flight
will be unlike any other.

22:10.905 --> 22:16.559
Since I've been flying
for 47 years now, uh...

22:16.577 --> 22:19.820
I've had a lot of flights
in that area.

22:19.839 --> 22:24.416
But this experience
I'll never forget.

22:24.569 --> 22:26.827
It all started a hundred miles
east of Miami

22:26.846 --> 22:31.849
when I found myself surrounded
by this strange storm.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.688
Time started changing instantly.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.101
And I believe I actually got to
see the fabric of time itself

22:42.253 --> 22:46.922
as I watched the tunnel rotate.

22:46.941 --> 22:49.867
When I reached the other end,
the tunnel collapsed.

22:52.096 --> 22:54.538
And I reached the shoreline
of Miami Beach.

22:56.117 --> 22:59.860
It only took three minutes
and 20 seconds

22:59.954 --> 23:02.529
to fly a hundred miles.

23:02.623 --> 23:08.219
I should have been able to fly
only ten miles, approximately.

23:08.370 --> 23:11.055
Not 100 miles.

23:12.617 --> 23:14.058
HENRY: I think that what
he must have experienced

23:14.285 --> 23:16.894
is perhaps some kind
of a time shift,

23:17.045 --> 23:20.472
or he entered
into an anomalous vortex

23:20.625 --> 23:23.792
that perhaps was
some kind of a time portal.

23:23.811 --> 23:27.905
We don't know, but it's a very
curious example of time travel.

23:29.224 --> 23:30.633
NARRATOR:
Could it be

23:30.651 --> 23:32.576
that the route
Bruce Gernon traveled

23:32.728 --> 23:35.061
led him into
a portal through time?

23:35.081 --> 23:38.899
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

23:38.918 --> 23:42.494
this incredible possibility
is even more intriguing

23:42.647 --> 23:47.258
because of the area where it
happened, the Bermuda Triangle.

23:47.409 --> 23:52.096
The Bermuda Triangle is really
located off of, uh, Florida.

23:52.247 --> 23:56.659
The northern point of it
is the island of Bermuda.

23:56.677 --> 23:59.845
It then goes down to,
essentially, southern Florida,

23:59.997 --> 24:02.273
and then out into The Bahamas.

24:02.500 --> 24:05.167
And this is an area
that has historically

24:05.186 --> 24:06.569
had strange phenomenon.

24:08.172 --> 24:09.838
NARRATOR:
While Gernon was
fortunate enough

24:09.932 --> 24:12.432
to have survived
his harrowing experience,

24:12.452 --> 24:15.694
many ships and aircraft
traveling through this region

24:15.846 --> 24:18.581
have disappeared
without a trace.

24:22.036 --> 24:23.961
In one extraordinary case

24:24.188 --> 24:27.948
that occurred
on December 5, 1945,

24:27.967 --> 24:30.283
five Navy Avenger
torpedo bombers,

24:30.377 --> 24:36.456
known as Flight 19, all went
missing at the same time.

24:36.550 --> 24:40.478
All five of their compasses
were not working correctly,

24:40.705 --> 24:42.963
and they had
two navigational instruments

24:42.982 --> 24:44.464
that they could use,
and they were not

24:44.484 --> 24:45.816
-working properly, either.
-(alarm buzzing)

24:48.212 --> 24:50.546
NARRATOR:
The planes
disappeared from radar,

24:50.639 --> 24:52.472
and their last communication

24:52.492 --> 24:55.493
consisted of nothing
but eerie static.

24:55.644 --> 24:58.645
(radio static)

24:58.664 --> 25:01.073
The Navy immediately sent
a team to search

25:01.225 --> 25:05.002
for the missing bombers, but
they never recovered any debris.

25:08.566 --> 25:11.658
Is it possible
that the Bermuda Triangle

25:11.677 --> 25:16.905
is subject to portals
or vortexes

25:16.999 --> 25:20.851
that create these mysteries?

25:21.003 --> 25:23.670
What we do know
is that it is a place

25:23.689 --> 25:27.358
of intensive
electromagnetic activity,

25:27.509 --> 25:30.435
and this is something
that we can tell

25:30.588 --> 25:34.439
from the fact that
so many aircraft and ships

25:34.592 --> 25:38.702
experience problems
with their instrumentation.

25:41.523 --> 25:44.691
NARRATOR:
Might the Bermuda Triangle
be an electromagnetic hot spot

25:44.710 --> 25:47.603
where portals
capable of manipulating time

25:47.621 --> 25:49.696
open and close?

25:49.715 --> 25:53.442
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

25:53.460 --> 25:56.962
and they believe that
these portals may help explain

25:57.114 --> 25:59.723
some of the strange,
otherworldly activity

25:59.875 --> 26:01.892
reported in the area.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.620
Many UFO sightings

26:04.713 --> 26:07.731
and m-more modern
UAP, uh, videos

26:07.883 --> 26:11.718
have been released show unusual
flight dynamics and capabilities

26:11.737 --> 26:14.220
of these... whatever they are.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.965
Well, it may be
they're creating portals,

26:16.984 --> 26:19.802
in our universe
and in our time and our space,

26:19.820 --> 26:22.805
that they can move
in and out of, uh, at will.

26:22.823 --> 26:24.973
There's no reason
to, uh, say they can't

26:24.992 --> 26:27.084
until we know what they are.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.254
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that visitors

26:30.481 --> 26:32.572
from other worlds
are utilizing portals

26:32.666 --> 26:34.316
in the Bermuda Triangle

26:34.409 --> 26:37.169
to travel through time
and space?

26:37.263 --> 26:42.007
And if so, do such portals
already exist naturally,

26:42.159 --> 26:44.250
or are they being created

26:44.270 --> 26:47.438
with some type
of extraterrestrial technology?

26:48.682 --> 26:50.833
Perhaps the answer can be found

26:50.851 --> 26:54.612
by examining the account
of a UFO witness who claims

26:54.839 --> 26:57.781
to have received
a message from the future.

27:04.272 --> 27:05.772
NARRATOR:
In Suffolk County, England,
there is a remote forest

27:05.866 --> 27:08.033
in the village of Rendlesham

27:08.185 --> 27:10.202
that has become famous
for being the site

27:10.296 --> 27:14.298
of one of the most extraordinary
UFO encounters ever reported.

27:14.449 --> 27:17.134
And some of those
who experienced it

27:17.361 --> 27:20.879
believe this incident
also involved time travel.

27:21.031 --> 27:25.309
The event occurred
on December 26, 1980.

27:25.536 --> 27:27.978
Airman John Burroughs
was performing

27:28.205 --> 27:31.206
a routine security check
at a U.S. Air Force base

27:31.225 --> 27:32.799
when he received orders

27:32.818 --> 27:36.302
to investigate
a possible downed aircraft.

27:36.397 --> 27:38.230
BURROUGHS:
My supervisor called me
on the radio and asked

27:38.382 --> 27:41.216
to meet up with him
so we could check the east gate.

27:41.235 --> 27:43.143
We're driving down the road
leading to the east gate

27:43.162 --> 27:45.812
to check on it
when all of a sudden he saw

27:45.831 --> 27:47.122
some strange lights
in the forest.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.501
So I decided we'll call it in

27:50.652 --> 27:52.911
and let them know
something strange was going on.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.731
They decided to send one
of the security units down.

27:55.824 --> 27:58.066
So it was Sergeant Penniston.

27:58.085 --> 27:59.918
He got down there and he saw
the same strange lights

28:00.070 --> 28:01.095
that we were seeing.

28:02.923 --> 28:04.406
JAMES PENNISTON:
So I could see
all these multiple

28:04.499 --> 28:06.166
color lights
and things like that.

28:06.260 --> 28:08.260
And the air felt different.

28:08.412 --> 28:11.838
I don't know how
to really explain that.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.841
But it did feel like
there was electricity

28:14.935 --> 28:16.509
on our skin and hair and stuff.

28:16.529 --> 28:19.588
But that progressively got worse

28:19.681 --> 28:20.939
the closer we got
to the tree line.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.183
And it got more intense.

28:23.277 --> 28:27.446
BURROUGHS:
There seemed to be, like, an
electricity-charged atmosphere,

28:27.598 --> 28:29.373
and then, also,
there were points where there--

28:29.600 --> 28:31.934
it seemed like everything
was going in slow motion.

28:32.027 --> 28:34.878
NARRATOR:
As the servicemen approached
the strange lights,

28:35.030 --> 28:38.549
Sergeant Penniston
reportedly saw a large craft

28:38.700 --> 28:40.792
just beyond the tree line.

28:40.945 --> 28:42.720
PENNISTON:
The craft was triangular
in shape,

28:42.947 --> 28:45.447
measuring about
six to seven feet high,

28:45.466 --> 28:47.725
black in color.

28:47.952 --> 28:49.893
I had come around
to the far side of the craft,

28:50.045 --> 28:51.562
and that's when I noticed
that there was,

28:51.713 --> 28:53.230
you know,
inscription on the side.

28:53.381 --> 28:55.123
You know, it is about
three feet long,

28:55.217 --> 28:58.068
maybe six inches high, um,

28:58.295 --> 29:01.572
and, uh, so I'm expecting
to find, I don't know,

29:01.799 --> 29:04.299
some kind of prototype stuff,
uh, USAF.

29:04.318 --> 29:05.909
I'm-I'm looking
for something very familiar.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.805
Instead of something familiar,

29:09.898 --> 29:12.491
I see these
pictorial-type glyphs.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.327
And got running my hand
over the side of the craft.

29:15.479 --> 29:17.329
I don't know
how to explain this.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.240
It's like someone
was holding a picture up, okay?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.426
I could see it in my mind's eye.

29:24.171 --> 29:27.155
Zeros and ones.

29:27.249 --> 29:29.933
So I recorded those.
One after another.

29:31.495 --> 29:33.161
HESELTINE:
When Penniston touched

29:33.180 --> 29:35.439
the craft, he then said

29:35.666 --> 29:39.425
that he felt a strange download
of information,

29:39.445 --> 29:41.853
uh, to his mind.

29:42.006 --> 29:45.841
And he felt compelled
the next day to write down

29:45.859 --> 29:47.951
a series of zeros and ones,

29:48.178 --> 29:51.196
which we now regard
as binary code.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.031
POPE:
Years later,

29:53.183 --> 29:56.960
a computer programmer
took this information,

29:57.187 --> 29:59.704
ran it through
a translation program

29:59.799 --> 30:02.633
and a message emerged.

30:02.784 --> 30:07.304
The message read:
"Exploration of humanity

30:07.455 --> 30:11.475
"continuous for
planetary advance,

30:11.702 --> 30:14.719
"eyes of your eyes,

30:14.814 --> 30:18.373
origin year 8100."

30:18.466 --> 30:23.654
When one sees
"origin year 8100,"

30:23.881 --> 30:25.972
one is forced to speculate,
might we be looking

30:25.991 --> 30:28.474
not just at extraterrestrials,

30:28.494 --> 30:31.720
but time travelers
from the future?

30:31.738 --> 30:34.814
NARRATOR:
After the incident,
the U.S. military

30:34.834 --> 30:37.167
conducted a brief investigation,

30:37.394 --> 30:39.744
but allegedly tried
to keep the eyewitnesses

30:39.897 --> 30:41.505
away from the press.

30:43.067 --> 30:46.234
But for Airman Burroughs
and Officer Penniston,

30:46.328 --> 30:48.679
the event wasn't easy
to leave behind.

30:50.574 --> 30:54.076
Both men had lasting physical
effects from the encounter

30:54.169 --> 30:57.596
and even reported
strange dreams.

30:57.690 --> 31:01.692
After the incident, I started
having throat and eye problems.

31:01.919 --> 31:03.268
At one point,
my gums turned white.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.420
I also had vision problems,

31:05.439 --> 31:06.846
and when I went
and saw the doctor,

31:06.940 --> 31:08.924
one of his first questions was,

31:09.017 --> 31:10.659
had I been ever exposed
to radiation?

31:11.945 --> 31:15.021
I've definitely
had dreams about it,

31:15.040 --> 31:17.265
and I still have feelings
about what happened

31:17.284 --> 31:19.293
and what could happen
in the future.

31:21.288 --> 31:24.464
I got out of the service
in 1993.

31:26.276 --> 31:28.460
Then I was out about
maybe three months,

31:28.612 --> 31:33.298
and then, I started getting
these dreams and nightmares.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.467
During the dreams,

31:35.561 --> 31:37.561
I could see that these
were time travelers,

31:37.788 --> 31:40.564
40 to 50,000 years
in the future.

31:40.791 --> 31:43.308
I see that their purpose
to come back

31:43.460 --> 31:47.129
was to correct things,
was to fix things.

31:47.222 --> 31:50.223
Something horrible has happened.

31:50.317 --> 31:53.635
Something they have to correct.

31:53.654 --> 31:56.229
But it requires time travel.

31:56.323 --> 32:00.825
It requires going back
into the past.

32:00.920 --> 32:05.738
I never had a feeling of it
being extraterrestrial.

32:05.832 --> 32:12.346
It's always been that they were
simply us in the future.

32:14.341 --> 32:17.159
NARRATOR:
Could it be that the craft
reportedly witnessed

32:17.177 --> 32:19.919
by James Penniston
and John Burroughs

32:20.013 --> 32:22.422
came not from a distant star

32:22.516 --> 32:25.258
but from a distant point
in time?

32:25.277 --> 32:28.853
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining trends

32:29.006 --> 32:33.617
in evolution and what humans
may look like in the future.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.606
MICHAEL MASTERS: If we look
at past trends

32:40.701 --> 32:42.626
in our biological form,

32:42.853 --> 32:45.295
we see that we're likely
to look very similar

32:45.447 --> 32:47.189
to what's
most commonly described

32:47.282 --> 32:49.132
in these instances
of close encounters.

32:55.699 --> 32:59.201
NARRATOR:
Butte, Montana, 2019.

32:59.219 --> 33:02.145
Professor
of biological anthropology

33:02.372 --> 33:05.131
at Montana
Technological University,

33:05.150 --> 33:10.395
Dr. Michael Masters publishes
<i> Identified Flying Objects.</i>

33:10.489 --> 33:13.882
This groundbreaking book
explores the profound notion

33:13.900 --> 33:16.401
that the UFO phenomenon
may involve

33:16.495 --> 33:18.737
our distant human descendants

33:18.889 --> 33:22.249
traveling backward
across the landscape of time.

33:24.152 --> 33:25.894
MASTERS:
One of the big questions about

33:25.987 --> 33:28.005
backward time travel
is why aren't we inundated

33:28.232 --> 33:32.067
by time tourists
if backward time travel exists?

33:32.085 --> 33:35.070
And the answer
may simply be, we do.

33:35.088 --> 33:38.348
We do see them,
in the form of UFOs,

33:38.500 --> 33:40.017
in the form of these
"alien beings"

33:40.244 --> 33:42.927
that are most likely
traveling backwards

33:43.022 --> 33:46.081
from the human future,
using more advanced technology

33:46.174 --> 33:47.932
and with a more
advanced physical form

33:48.027 --> 33:49.484
than what we have now.

33:50.921 --> 33:52.678
NARRATOR:
Dr. Masters points out

33:52.698 --> 33:55.257
that current accounts
of humanoid aliens,

33:55.275 --> 33:58.443
the Greys in particular,
bear a striking resemblance

33:58.537 --> 34:01.780
to what many biologists
predict humans may look like

34:01.874 --> 34:04.690
in the distant future.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.285
MASTERS:
If we look at past trends
in our biological form

34:07.379 --> 34:09.271
and in our technology,

34:09.364 --> 34:12.049
we see the same dominant trends
in our morphology.

34:12.276 --> 34:16.053
Our neurocrania have become
enlarged, becoming more rounded.

34:16.204 --> 34:19.614
Our midfacial and lower
facial anatomy has retracted.

34:19.633 --> 34:22.450
If these are to continue
into the future,

34:22.544 --> 34:24.786
we're likely
to look very similar

34:24.879 --> 34:26.288
to what's most
commonly described

34:26.381 --> 34:28.548
in these instances
of close encounters,

34:28.567 --> 34:32.694
where the being have big heads,
small faces, big eyes.

34:34.889 --> 34:38.483
NEWMAN: Many of the types
of aliens, if you like,

34:38.635 --> 34:41.486
or strange beings
that are in these crafts,

34:41.638 --> 34:44.081
they're often taller,
they've got larger heads,

34:44.232 --> 34:47.309
larger eyes, and that
could be a sign of evolution

34:47.402 --> 34:49.735
of our species going thousands

34:49.755 --> 34:51.571
or possibly hundreds
of thousands of years

34:51.590 --> 34:53.090
into the future.

34:53.241 --> 34:55.741
NARRATOR:
Could the so-called Grey aliens

34:55.761 --> 34:58.320
that many people believe
they have encountered

34:58.413 --> 35:01.431
actually be
human time travelers?

35:01.583 --> 35:04.509
According to some researchers,
further evidence

35:04.603 --> 35:08.513
that Earth is being visited
by future humans can be found

35:08.607 --> 35:12.734
by examining accounts
of unidentified flying objects.

35:14.429 --> 35:16.338
MASTERS:
If we look at the craft, too,

35:16.356 --> 35:19.190
they seem to have a form
that indicates the function

35:19.284 --> 35:21.176
of backward time travel.

35:21.269 --> 35:23.269
It's very consistent
with research

35:23.363 --> 35:28.032
since Einstein's paper in 1915,
demonstrating how the rotation

35:28.185 --> 35:31.186
of a massive or highly
energetic disc or cylinder

35:31.204 --> 35:34.131
could create backward
time travel capabilities.

35:36.026 --> 35:37.450
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
Sometimes I ask myself

35:37.544 --> 35:40.220
if UFOs are not time travelers.

35:41.623 --> 35:46.643
It's our own, uh,
people of the future

35:46.794 --> 35:50.630
who study some history
and they send some vehicles

35:50.649 --> 35:53.375
to measure, to observe,
to photograph us.

35:53.393 --> 35:56.227
But they don't make
direct contact.

35:56.321 --> 36:00.323
So I would exclude nothing,
not even time travel.

36:00.475 --> 36:04.068
NARRATOR:
But if future humans
have traveled back in time,

36:04.163 --> 36:07.146
are they simply observing
events of the past?

36:07.166 --> 36:10.575
Or could they have
a more profound agenda?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.319
One of the other ideas
relating to this is the idea

36:13.413 --> 36:16.231
that our selves from the future

36:16.249 --> 36:18.400
are actually trying
to help us in some way.

36:18.493 --> 36:20.568
There's some kind
of interaction going on.

36:20.587 --> 36:22.253
They could be
giving us information

36:22.347 --> 36:25.331
about advances in technology.

36:25.425 --> 36:29.411
They could be giving us
information about other planets.

36:29.429 --> 36:31.504
They could be giving us
scientific data

36:31.598 --> 36:33.915
that we need to survive

36:34.008 --> 36:35.433
that they know
about in the future,

36:35.585 --> 36:38.195
but y-- we're yet
to get to that point.

36:40.014 --> 36:41.013
COLLINS:
Could they be coming back

36:41.033 --> 36:43.441
to help evolve us in some way,

36:43.535 --> 36:48.688
to help us learn new
technologies and innovations?

36:48.707 --> 36:53.768
Perhaps to steer us
towards their own future.

36:53.861 --> 36:56.271
Maybe these technologies
involve everything

36:56.289 --> 37:01.033
from quantum computers
to nuclear fusion

37:01.053 --> 37:06.223
to AI
and even nanotechnology.

37:06.450 --> 37:09.392
All of these are
at the cutting edge of science,

37:09.619 --> 37:11.895
and we are actually
looking for answers

37:12.122 --> 37:16.524
to how to better perfect
these technologies.

37:18.052 --> 37:20.812
MASTERS:
If UFOs are craft

37:20.964 --> 37:24.148
from our future, if the beings
seen in association with them

37:24.301 --> 37:27.059
are our distant descendants,

37:27.079 --> 37:30.580
and they crashed into
Roswell, New Mexico in 1947,

37:30.807 --> 37:33.733
it's possible that we've
been reverse-engineering

37:33.752 --> 37:35.994
this technology.

37:36.088 --> 37:39.831
And not just for the purposes
of flying through space

37:39.983 --> 37:42.166
at tremendous speeds

37:42.261 --> 37:45.095
or having antigravity
propulsion systems,

37:45.246 --> 37:49.157
but also, potentially, to figure
out how to travel through time.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.101
We may be eventually
reaching the point

37:51.252 --> 37:54.086
where that technology is ours,
coming back through time again,

37:54.180 --> 37:57.190
where there's this constant loop
through the past and the future.

37:59.427 --> 38:02.003
NARRATOR:
If time travel is possible,

38:02.096 --> 38:04.263
could it be that Earth
is being visited

38:04.283 --> 38:09.953
by both extraterrestrials
and humans from our own future?

38:10.104 --> 38:12.363
Perhaps further clues
can be found

38:12.516 --> 38:14.440
by examining the possibility

38:14.534 --> 38:18.628
that the true nature of time
is much different than we think.

38:27.455 --> 38:29.864
NARRATOR:
Housed at the National Institute

38:29.883 --> 38:31.808
of Standards and Technology

38:32.035 --> 38:34.886
are two atomic clocks
that together serve

38:34.980 --> 38:39.223
as the United States' primary
time and frequency standard.

38:39.318 --> 38:43.486
Around the world, similar clocks
with incredible precision

38:43.713 --> 38:47.231
set the time by which
all of humankind operates.

38:47.326 --> 38:52.144
It is a relentless march
of seconds, minutes, hours

38:52.238 --> 38:55.481
and days determining
when we wake up,

38:55.575 --> 38:59.502
go to work, eat,
sleep, celebrate

38:59.654 --> 39:01.004
-and ultimately, die.
-(monitor beeps)

39:02.674 --> 39:05.083
But what if how we perceive time

39:05.235 --> 39:08.069
is nothing more
than a human construct?

39:08.088 --> 39:11.756
An attempt to quantify
and control a universal force

39:11.908 --> 39:16.144
that modern science
hasn't even begun to understand?

39:17.505 --> 39:19.764
We live in the fantasy
of linear time,

39:19.916 --> 39:21.749
because we have to remember

39:21.768 --> 39:24.861
that all the notions of time
are imposed on reality.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.089
Reality flows in its own way.

39:28.182 --> 39:30.533
We imagine
that our clocks measure it.

39:30.685 --> 39:32.351
We claim to be able
to mark it off

39:32.371 --> 39:33.853
in hours and days and things,

39:33.872 --> 39:35.622
but that's all just
imposed on it.

39:37.191 --> 39:38.858
NARRATOR:
Physicists point out

39:38.877 --> 39:42.194
that going by modern science's
linear concept of time,

39:42.288 --> 39:46.699
even the idea of the here
and now is merely an illusion,

39:46.793 --> 39:50.720
since light and sound
do not travel instantaneously.

39:50.872 --> 39:52.889
When you look at a mirror,
you're not really looking

39:53.040 --> 39:55.466
at yourself as you are,
you're looking at yourself

39:55.560 --> 39:59.137
as you were about
a billionth of a second ago.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.289
When you look at the Moon,
you're not really looking

40:01.307 --> 40:03.233
at the Moon as it is now.

40:03.460 --> 40:06.719
You're looking at the Moon
as it was about a second ago.

40:06.813 --> 40:09.221
So when you look
at the Pleiades,

40:09.241 --> 40:14.244
you're looking at the Pleiades
as they were 400 years ago.

40:16.489 --> 40:18.898
NARRATOR:
Some of the stars
viewable in the night sky

40:18.992 --> 40:20.900
burnt out long ago,

40:20.919 --> 40:23.736
which, according
to a linear model of time,

40:23.830 --> 40:25.663
means they no longer exist.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.316
They are no longer reachable.

40:28.334 --> 40:31.428
But what if this model
of time is wrong?

40:34.491 --> 40:36.582
TAYLOR: Another take
on time travel is that

40:36.601 --> 40:38.993
when the Big Bang occurred,
all of space and time

40:39.012 --> 40:41.587
and everything is in it
was created.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.607
So all of time
is in the universe already.

40:44.834 --> 40:47.610
For some reason,
we can only experience the now.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.430
NARRATOR:
Could it be that
our understanding of time

40:51.450 --> 40:54.099
is limited
by how we experience it?

40:54.194 --> 40:56.602
And might a more
technologically-advanced

40:56.621 --> 41:00.531
extraterrestrial species
or even future humans

41:00.684 --> 41:03.685
have discovered how
to manipulate time and space

41:03.703 --> 41:06.871
to travel both to the past
and to the future?

41:06.965 --> 41:11.951
COLLINS: The idea that we may
simply be dealing with

41:12.045 --> 41:15.955
space people
from other star systems

41:16.049 --> 41:17.865
may not be the full answer.

41:17.884 --> 41:20.935
We could be dealing
with time travelers.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.649
Could these intelligences
have been aiding us?

41:26.876 --> 41:28.543
Perhaps guiding us?

41:28.636 --> 41:32.989
Perhaps controlling
the evolution of humanity?

41:33.140 --> 41:37.068
VON DANIKEN:
I rather am a believer
in time travel.

41:37.162 --> 41:41.405
I say nothing will be impossible
for us in the future.

41:41.558 --> 41:43.482
Even if you think
it's completely crazy,

41:43.576 --> 41:45.059
it will happen.

41:45.152 --> 41:47.078
Whatever humans
are able to think,

41:47.172 --> 41:50.823
to calculate, even to fantasize,

41:50.917 --> 41:54.660
will one day become reality.

41:54.754 --> 41:59.665
NARRATOR: Is Earth being visited
by highly-advanced civilizations

41:59.759 --> 42:03.836
that have overcome the
limitations of time and space?

42:03.930 --> 42:08.674
And if so, could they even be
our own human descendants

42:08.768 --> 42:11.176
traveling back from the future?

42:11.196 --> 42:15.180
Perhaps our notions
of time, space

42:15.200 --> 42:17.258
and our place in the universe

42:17.351 --> 42:19.777
are about to be
radically altered.

42:19.929 --> 42:22.096
Only time will tell.
