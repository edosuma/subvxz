00:02.460 --> 00:05.338
-(orchestra music playing)
-(Howard humming with music)

00:29.362 --> 00:32.907
Oh, Judas H. Christ.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.376
(humming)

00:52.010 --> 00:53.762
(cash register dings)

00:58.767 --> 01:00.268
MAN: Come on, make it quick. Let's go.

01:02.062 --> 01:02.937
Get down.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.231
MAN: Come on, man, let's go.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.650
Come on, give me the money.
Don't got all day.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.444
CASHIER: Just... Take it easy.
I'll give it to you.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.196
MAN: Come on, make it quick. Let's go.

01:12.947 --> 01:13.865
Come on!

01:18.661 --> 01:20.080
-Police officer. Drop the weapon.
-(gasps)

01:20.580 --> 01:22.957
Come on, man. Let's do it.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.626
-(cocks gun)
-(gunshot)

01:37.555 --> 01:38.848
HOWARD: He's only a boy.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.268
-Call 911?
-Yeah.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.770
Uh, call the police.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.439
Eight, Detective LaRue and Washington

01:46.523 --> 01:49.109
continue their
Bonnie's Boutique surveillance.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.027
You guys coming up
on your first anniversary over there?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.904
You guys got to reel
that one in pretty soon.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.906
This attitude is why
they had to go back in

01:54.989 --> 01:57.492
-on the president's nose, sarge.
-Excuse me, J.D.?

01:57.575 --> 01:58.535
-When the president...
-Oh, brother.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.619
had that thing on his nose.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.372
See, they didn't do
a full thorough job the first time.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.709
We're trying to document the full spectrum
of fencing activity over there.

02:06.793 --> 02:10.213
Well, let's hope you get the full spectrum
documented pretty soon

02:10.296 --> 02:12.590
so we can get the full spectrum
of suspects.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.634
(laughter)

02:14.717 --> 02:17.428
Last, of course,
this is the first of the month.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.473
We got an expectation
of muggings and assaults

02:20.557 --> 02:23.101
in the vicinity of the Michigan branch
of the post office.

02:23.184 --> 02:27.147
To wit, a black male,
uh, six feet tall, 30-35.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.692
Now, for the last two months this creep
has been beating up on old people,

02:30.775 --> 02:32.235
robbing them of their pension checks.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.278
All patrols have been alerted.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.071
Detective Belker has been assigned.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.365
Let's, uh, let's nail the bastard.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.409
-Sarge, what about this PD business here?
-What?

02:39.659 --> 02:41.244
ALL: Yeah!

02:41.327 --> 02:44.747
Andrew, it's my understanding
that the council vote on whether or not

02:44.831 --> 02:47.167
to restore funds to keep
the public defender office

02:47.250 --> 02:50.003
up to its-- up to its, uh,
present compliment,

02:50.086 --> 02:51.838
that-that vote comes up this afternoon.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.673
I understand, sir,
but are they gonna go on strike

02:53.756 --> 02:55.091
-if this money is not restored?
-(overlapping voices)

02:55.175 --> 02:56.301
I'm not in the fortune telling business.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.219
RENKO: Why should they be able
to go on strike?

02:58.303 --> 03:01.264
Andrew, the PDs are gonna do
what they got to do,

03:01.347 --> 03:03.391
and we're gonna do what we gotta do.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.226
Would the captain like to get in a word?

03:07.061 --> 03:08.605
Okay, let's roll. Let's roll.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.649
(indistinct chatter)

03:18.489 --> 03:19.407
What's up?

03:20.658 --> 03:22.327
What in the hell are you doing, Stan?

03:22.869 --> 03:23.703
What do you mean?

03:24.746 --> 03:25.955
I just got off the phone with your doctor.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.790
He said you were supposed to meet him
at the hospital this morning.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.043
-Oh, that...
-Frank.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.421
Howard just walked in on a 211.
He had to put the perp down.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.341
-I'll be up in a minute, Henry.
-It may be a problem shoot.

03:36.716 --> 03:37.800
In a minute, Henry.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.220
It's all been taken care of, Captain.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.432
He says he saw you twice over the weekend.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.100
He says you need a bypass.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.312
I, uh, I got a second opinion.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.356
It, uh, was a false alarm.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.274
Give me the name of the second doctor.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.238
Look, you got to let me
handle this my own way.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.323
-I can't do that, Stan.
-You got to.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.075
I ain't leaving.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.452
-Stan--
-Leave me alone.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.371
Let me do my job.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.545
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:14.629 --> 04:16.297
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:16.381 --> 04:20.093
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:20.176 --> 04:21.886
(sirens wailing)

04:27.600 --> 04:30.645
(theme music playing)

05:55.313 --> 05:57.440
(men shouting)

06:31.933 --> 06:33.393
Joyce, it's over.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.354
They finally did it. My pink slip.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.690
-Luce, are you assigned?
-Mm.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.609
Can-can you spend the day
in the stationhouse?

06:42.360 --> 06:45.405
I guess we're going to be up to our necks
in perps with the PD thing, boss, huh?

06:45.488 --> 06:46.864
(clears throat)
Would you keep an eye on Stan?

06:47.448 --> 06:48.950
-Yeah.
-Uh, Norm.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.493
Huh?

06:50.576 --> 06:53.454
Can you afford to lose a day
on the Spearman investigation?

06:53.871 --> 06:56.749
Yeah, I, uh, I'm going to see the wife
and then the bondsman again.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.793
I want you on site follow up
of Howard's shooting.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.670
Yeah, let me make one call.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.588
The suits looking to jam
the lieutenant up, huh?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.173
-Yeah, make your call.
-All right.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.591
-Excuse me.
-Howard.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.427
Oh, Frank.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.096
You heard I was off and all?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.681
-I heard.
-Captain.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.559
IAD Officer Shipman, Lieutenant.

07:15.810 --> 07:16.769
Officer.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.396
I'd like to get your statement
as soon as possible.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.815
All right. (sighs)

07:21.315 --> 07:24.402
Uh, I expect, Howard,
you-you'll want to wash up a little.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.487
I mean, take a few minutes
to collect your thoughts.

07:27.655 --> 07:31.242
-Yes, I guess I should.
-Would you, uh, use this, Lieutenant?

07:32.201 --> 07:33.202
It's for a urine sample.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.706
Go in his freakin' hand.

07:42.086 --> 07:42.962
Excuse me.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.132
Take interrogation room A.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.634
-Stan.
-Uh, I'm busy now, Captain.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.386
Uh, Stan, we're gonna have to face this.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.681
(sighs) Okay, fine,
but after we finish the shift, okay?

07:53.764 --> 07:54.891
We'll take care of it then.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.311
-I promise.
-We will talk about it then.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.813
Yeah, okay, fine. But I am busy now.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.231
I got a lot to do.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.654
Hey, Mr. PD, can you get me out of here?

08:08.738 --> 08:11.449
-It's my mother's birthday.
-Got the wrong guy, Rhonda.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.201
-I'm fired.
-What do you mean fired?

08:13.284 --> 08:16.913
I mean the city council just did to me
what you get done to you all day.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.790
It's got to be saber rattling.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.086
They can't really expect us to operate
at two-thirds our present strength.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.672
You're kidding yourself, Joyce.
That's exactly what they expect.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.550
And they're going to make it stick
unless we go out.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.260
We still have other cards to play.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.471
Oh, yeah? What hand are you looking at?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.890
We're public employees, Danny.
It's illegal to strike.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.017
Yeah, a strike is illegal.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.061
And what the council is doing is a crime.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.189
Uh, Ms. Davenport, Roland Lefferts.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.815
-Interrogation B.
-Thanks.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.359
See you at the strategy session.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.236
Uh, it's going to be a strike meeting.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.615
(whistling)

08:55.409 --> 08:56.953
-Howard.
-Henry.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.626
-You okay?
-Yeah.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.755
I've discharged my weapon in war time
knowing that the results might be mortal.

09:07.838 --> 09:12.093
I've given orders that I knew would
probably result in a perpetrator's death.

09:12.176 --> 09:16.639
Uh... it's just that I have never, uh,
mano a mano as it were,

09:16.722 --> 09:19.016
I've never actually shot someone
at close range.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.518
(sighs)

09:20.601 --> 09:23.020
Seeing life leave someone's eyes...

09:24.438 --> 09:26.107
Something awesome about it, Henry. Uh...

09:26.857 --> 09:29.026
-And horrible.
-I'm sorry.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.904
Oh, there was no choice.
He brought his gun to bear.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.573
There was no question
it was going to kill me.

09:34.657 --> 09:38.411
Howard, you want to take
a little more time before you see IAD?

09:39.036 --> 09:41.956
-Maybe talk to a counselor?
-No, I think I'm--

09:42.540 --> 09:44.333
I'm pretty well in touch
with what happened.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.835
I think I see it pretty clearly.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.713
(chuckles)

09:49.130 --> 09:50.381
They requested my urine.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.388
I...

09:58.097 --> 10:01.392
I think I'd be better able to oblige
without an audience.

10:02.810 --> 10:03.686
HENRY: Right.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.494
This is a no-win situation.

10:20.578 --> 10:24.123
Yesterday, I took prune juice.
I never left my bathroom.

10:24.206 --> 10:28.127
Today, I abstain and I haven't had
a single peep from that area.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.379
He doesn't care if you're regular, Hilda.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.465
You know what happened
to Tessie last month?

10:32.548 --> 10:34.091
A hoodlum followed her home.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.594
-From here?
-Stole her check.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.847
What did he look like?

10:40.431 --> 10:42.350
HILDA: A hoodlum,
how else is he gonna look?

10:42.433 --> 10:43.434
I shouldn't have come.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.810
-Oh, she's afraid.
-Sit down.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.480
Nobody will touch you today.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.023
You guarantee that?

10:49.398 --> 10:52.318
He's a big strong man.
Don't even need a walker.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.695
I'm curious.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.615
What do you remember
about the man who robbed you?

10:57.698 --> 10:59.116
HILDA: Tessie, sweetheart,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.327
it doesn't do any good
to dwell on the past.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.829
Do you mind? I want to know
what the gonif looked like.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.958
Can you tell me, darling?

11:08.542 --> 11:10.836
He covered his face with a stocking.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.174
He grabbed my money, then he pushed me.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.759
So I fell.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.095
-Yoo-hoo.
-What?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.722
-I'm forgetting your rudeness.
-I'm thrilled.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.641
You new here in the neighborhood?

11:25.893 --> 11:27.019
Relatively.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.522
Widowed perchance?

11:30.564 --> 11:31.565
(whimpers)

11:31.816 --> 11:34.819
-(music playing on radio)
-(camera clicks)

11:35.528 --> 11:39.990
J.D.: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, please.
Hurt me some more.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.992
Hey, babe, save some of the film
for when she makes a buy.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.412
-I brought extra rolls. Oh!
-(camera clicking continues)

11:44.495 --> 11:46.163
Only new evidence we got
in the last two days

11:46.247 --> 11:48.165
is what radio station she listens to.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.293
I'm telling you, lover,
if they put this undercover

11:51.377 --> 11:53.546
up on our review, we are in the soup.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.215
Hey, you know, there's a chance
we could get her connection's connection.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.175
Hey, hey, hey, here come her friends.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.428
-Yeah.
-Hey. Same guys, too.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.347
J.D.: Buttinskis.
Man, she bossa nova's to this tune.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.183
-NATE: We got to make a move, J.D.
-J.D.: Would you take it easy?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.394
The stuff they're selling
belongs to other people, J.D.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.188
All right, okay.
Look, we'll do it this afternoon.

12:12.940 --> 12:13.816
(sighs)

12:14.483 --> 12:17.153
J.D.: Gonna have to interface
with the police, sweetheart.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.864
-(camera clicking)
-And it's that mean Neal's fault.

12:20.364 --> 12:24.577
For just a brief instance
I felt a flicker of pulse in his carotid.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.203
Then he was gone.

12:26.996 --> 12:32.084
I instructed the store owner's assistant
to call 911 and continued CPR

12:32.168 --> 12:33.419
until the paramedics arrived.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.047
I'm now going to begin
questioning you, Lieutenant.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.091
I ask you to repeat
you've declined your right to counsel.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.302
Uh, yes, correct.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.308
Are you sure you want to do that?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.187
My concerns about this incident,
Officer Shipman,

12:51.270 --> 12:54.732
do not involve the propriety
of my professional conduct.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.570
Lieutenant, by your own admission,
your load was not department authorized,

12:59.653 --> 13:01.322
your piece was not department issue.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.492
Well, I presume that that would call for
some sort, uh, of procedural reprimand.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.243
Plus, the entry wound's near the back.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.996
Plus, the kid's 14.
Unless the record is wrong.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.956
Now you can presume
whatever you want to, Lieutenant,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.751
but if it was me,
I'd have representation in here.

13:15.002 --> 13:18.672
Look here, Officer,
this was a completely justified shoot.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.217
(sighs)

13:24.553 --> 13:26.222
Let's begin with your entrance
into the store.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.602
-(indistinct chattering)
-STAN: I'll take it.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.188
Come on.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.526
She hasn't been sent
to arraignment yet, ma'am.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.194
We're having some delays.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.864
Then I suggest you go ahead
and you serve the birthday cake.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.742
-The same to you.
-(receiver hangs up)

13:49.578 --> 13:50.496
Counselor.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.414
I thought you'd be
at the courthouse by now.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.708
PD's meeting was pushed back half an hour.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.168
I hear sentiments for a strike.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.713
City council's doing everything they can
to make it happen.

14:00.464 --> 14:04.176
They sent out pink slips this morning,
fired 18 PDs with the least seniority.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.012
Last I checked, a strike
by public employees was illegal.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.806
I don't need a lecture
on strike law, Frank.

14:08.889 --> 14:09.932
I'm not lecturing.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.560
I worry a strike would be
self-contradictory.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.688
To protect our future clients' right
to effective counsel,

14:15.771 --> 14:18.399
would be depriving our present clients
of representation.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.986
Not to mention I'd hate for us
to become a one income family.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.362
Especially on my income.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.321
(chuckles)

14:25.489 --> 14:26.782
Council meets at 4:00.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.826
Maybe they'll restore the appropriation.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.414
-How's Howard?
-He's still in with IAD.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.375
Poor man. I saw him
just after he'd come in.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.169
Didn't know what planet he was on.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.463
-See you.
-Yeah.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.968
Ballistics just came in
on Howard's shooting, Frank.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.345
Perp's piece was defective.
Malfunctioning firing pin.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.722
Howard couldn't have known that.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.849
I've got two press inquiries
on the piece Howard used

14:51.932 --> 14:53.976
asking if Barretta
is our department issue.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.562
No statement, pending IAD findings.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.647
I know. All I'm saying is
this isn't going to help.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.236
-Lieutenant.
-Yeah, you got a witness list?

15:09.825 --> 15:12.411
(indistinct chattering)

15:12.494 --> 15:13.746
Hey, Lieutenant. How you doing?

15:14.288 --> 15:17.917
MAN: My movement following
the officer's identifying himself,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.920
is away from the officer's position?

15:21.003 --> 15:24.173
He turned when his friend came in
and then he turned right back.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.050
He was gonna shoot the officer.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.718
You're sure that was his intent?

15:27.801 --> 15:29.428
He just said so.
How many times you gonna ask him, huh?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.513
Stay out of this, Lieutenant.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.140
I got an investigation to run here.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.643
Fellas, I gave my statement
three different times.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.603
That's too freakin' bad, pal.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.189
A cop's in the jackpot
'cause he stood up for you this morning.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.191
I'm just saying I'd like
to open up again sometime.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.776
You'll open up when I say you can.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.820
All right, so what about it, huh?

15:46.904 --> 15:48.906
I mean, I know you guys want another cop
for your mantelpiece,

15:48.989 --> 15:50.699
but this guy's buddy
is still on the street,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.577
-Go ahead.
-CLERK: I didn't see the other guy.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.454
I-I can't help you with that.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.499
How about you?

16:00.334 --> 16:01.168
I got a look.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.922
-I thought you didn't see him.
-I saw him.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.090
Can you give me a description?

16:06.173 --> 16:08.384
Don't mix into something unless you know
what you're doing, Ramon.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.344
Hey, you take your own advice, Shlomo.

16:10.427 --> 16:13.097
I can help.
I know where he hangs sometimes.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.015
Good for you. Come on.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.770
DANNY: And I want you
to understand one thing.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.940
City council's deciding nothing
at four o'clock.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.901
They already made their move this morning.

16:26.276 --> 16:30.572
Either you or a person
on either side of you was fired today.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.785
Now I want to know
why are we waiting to strike?

16:34.868 --> 16:37.204
-(overlapping chatter)
-Thanks, Danny.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.748
-Vote.
-Joyce.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.418
Uh, what did they say
about the possibility

16:42.501 --> 16:45.546
of restoring these positions
at the beginning of the new fiscal year?

16:45.629 --> 16:46.964
They wouldn't even talk about it.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.507
Said they wouldn't consider it.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.467
-MAN: Right.
-MAN 2: It was worse than before, Joyce.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.928
They feel like they've got the upper hand.
They're just not willing to give an inch.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.432
I still wonder if there isn't a way
short of striking

16:57.099 --> 17:00.227
-that we can dramatize or seriousness.
-(overlapping chatter)

17:00.310 --> 17:03.313
Well, I say the time
for gestures is over with.

17:03.397 --> 17:07.401
-(overlapping chatter)
-MAN: We have to strike.

17:07.484 --> 17:11.530
(♪ "Party All the Time"
by Eddie Murphy playing)

17:11.613 --> 17:13.574
(humming)

17:18.245 --> 17:20.706
Eighty-seven FM, it's my favorite station.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.125
-Hey, what do you think?
-Really and truly?

17:23.834 --> 17:26.420
-You'd look better in red.
-You know, it's amazing.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.506
Same size and everything.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.134
You and my girlfriend,
you've got a remarkable resemblance.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.136
-The two of you could be related.
-No.

17:34.970 --> 17:38.015
-No what?
-No, I won't try it on.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.850
Not even for five bucks?

17:41.602 --> 17:44.104
Ten. Hey, it's all I got.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.564
You're boring me.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.236
I got cameras.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.322
You need to get hit by a truck?

17:53.405 --> 17:57.117
I don't want to try anything on,
and I'm not interested in a photo session.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.162
Hey, cameras to sell.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.373
Kraut, high quality, slightly warm.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.795
-No kidding.
-No kidding.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.925
-Hey, did she bite?
-We're on for three o'clock.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.886
(chuckles) I was beginning to think
I'd be on this till retirement.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.140
-Hey, what's wrong, man?
-Poor kid.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.558
Poor kid?

18:22.267 --> 18:25.062
Hey, J.D., the chick's
been fencing stuff for a week now.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.190
People can be victims
of their environments, Neal.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.400
Now, I just think maybe I had her wrong.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.363
Maybe I can help with her plea bargain.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.865
(scoffs)

18:42.371 --> 18:44.039
MAN: Mr. Andrews, PD's taking--

18:44.123 --> 18:45.332
Oh, saints be praised.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.001
Ms. Davenport, our case
is third up on the docket.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.962
Any idea when it's gonna be called?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.672
I thought I was through
waiting around like this

18:51.755 --> 18:53.340
when I got mustered out of the service.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.675
-You aren't.
-Ma'am?

18:55.008 --> 18:57.845
I wouldn't hold my breath waiting
for your case to be called, gentlemen.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.888
REPORTER: Another question, Mr. Santana.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.890
You know, there are moments, Robert,

19:01.974 --> 19:03.851
when I like that woman
better than other moments.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.935
At ease, Private.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.731
Good of you to join us, Ms. Davenport.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.774
Sorry, Your Honor.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.026
BAILIFF: Docket B62578.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.195
<i>People vs. Pedro Rodriguez.</i>

19:15.279 --> 19:18.532
Possession of two ounces of a controlled
substance, to wit, marijuana.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.992
People waive reading of the complaint.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.954
-Defense request a reading, Your Honor.
-Excuse me?

19:24.037 --> 19:27.249
Defense requests reading of the complaint,
Your Honor, and of the rights.

19:28.917 --> 19:29.793
Counsel approach.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.632
Cut it out, Joycie.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.927
Defense intends to avail itself
of full entitlements, Your Honor.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.762
Defense is sending a message
to the city council.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.931
This court is not a message service.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.516
Your Honor, due process--

19:44.600 --> 19:47.644
I have a full docket today, Ms. Davenport.
I intend to get through it.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.146
Then may we proceed, Your Honor?

19:52.566 --> 19:53.817
-Go ahead.
-MAN: In the crime

19:53.901 --> 19:57.112
of possession of marijuana
in violation of health and safety codes...

19:57.196 --> 20:00.032
So what are your thoughts
about remarriage?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.826
You think it compliments
the original spouse?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.661
No. Yes.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.456
No that my Rueben
was such a day at the beach.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.249
TESSIE: Heading inside
just got their checks.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.543
We should be in the next batch.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.670
Excuse me.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.424
-Where are you going?
-I'm walking off a cramp.

20:20.802 --> 20:21.678
Moody.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.224
BOBBY: Get in the car, Mick.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.685
-What?
-Got to take you down to court, Mick.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.479
-No, it's a mistake.
-No. You got a case on that.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.690
No, no. That's a two-ounce marijuana bust.
They're gonna plead that.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.525
Ain't going to be
no plea bargain today, pal.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.194
PD's gumming up the whole thing, Mick.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.987
There are people being robbed here.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.406
I'm established on an undercover here.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.866
Mick, it's the DA's order.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.201
I want a presence.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.745
If I can't pop this guy,
I want him discouraged.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.873
-(sighs)
-Okay. I'll stay.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.713
I'll be the deterrent.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.466
(car door closes)

21:01.593 --> 21:03.095
The newcomer's been arrested?

21:03.178 --> 21:05.305
No, ma'am, the old man's
just being dropped off somewhere.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.767
Oh, and I was on a roll.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.984
Coming through. Nice and easy, pops.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.945
-I want a lawyer.
-Yeah? Take a number.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.114
Get him in the back.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.532
Keep it down.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.410
Keep him up here a while.
They're backing up in the cells.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.328
-Hey! Hey!
-(shouting)

21:28.412 --> 21:31.415
(clamoring)

21:31.498 --> 21:32.833
Hey, what is this?

21:34.626 --> 21:36.044
-That's enough!
-Come here.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.006
You pig! I'll kill you!

21:39.089 --> 21:40.299
Keep 'em separated.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.759
You stepped on my foot, man!

21:46.346 --> 21:48.724
-Stan, what's the matter?
-Not a word.

21:51.935 --> 21:52.811
What's going on?

21:52.894 --> 21:55.689
Well, uh, we still haven't been able
to ship out all the morning arraignments.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.399
I guess the PDs are really
slowing up the court.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.693
-Can we use garden level?
-We had a violent down there.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.987
Get him over to County Medical
for evaluation.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.115
Anything from Buntz?

22:05.324 --> 22:07.617
Uh, still looking
for the dead perp's accomplice.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.536
Frank.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.831
My, uh, people got that wrong,
didn't they?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.167
You refused to attend the press briefing.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.918
I said Lieutenant Goldblume would attend.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.670
We didn't ask for Lieutenant Goldblume.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.298
Lieutenant Goldblume
is community relations officer.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.759
That's the only part of Hunter's case
that's proper to discuss.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.094
-Cut the crap, Frank.
-You cut the crap.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.139
Hunter isn't even finished with IAD yet.
I'm not gonna feed him to the wolves.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.725
This is a 14-year-old Black kid.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.643
-No piece.
-His weapon didn't work.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.271
-No priors and he was shot in the back.
-In the side.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.856
With a howitzer and unapproved load

22:37.939 --> 22:40.233
and you don't think
we owe a public accounting?

22:40.317 --> 22:41.943
I think we owe it when the facts are in.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.155
Until then, we owe exactly what
Lieutenant Goldblume is trained to offer.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.825
Acknowledgement of community sentiment
and an assurance of a fair inquiry.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.702
Let me tell you something, Frank.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.079
And you better believe it.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.499
Your man's butt is in the wringer.
You understand that?

22:55.999 --> 22:57.751
I want that material on Hunter fast.

22:57.834 --> 22:58.794
MAN: Yes, Inspector.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.547
Can we speak in your office, Captain?

23:05.926 --> 23:08.470
I've received Lieutenant Hunter's
statement and conducted my interview.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.394
Lieutenant Hunter now has a right
to amend his statement,

23:15.477 --> 23:17.604
repent an explanation
before I submit my findings.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.356
Are you suggesting that's what he do?

23:20.899 --> 23:22.567
(sighs) If the lieutenant
would have decided

23:23.110 --> 23:25.028
he hadn't been fully cognizant
of what he was saying,

23:25.737 --> 23:27.030
we would then ask
to submit an explanation.

23:27.697 --> 23:28.824
Explain in what regard?

23:32.202 --> 23:33.537
I'll turn in my report at 6:00 p.m.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.874
-Lieutenant.
-Officer.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.253
-Captain.
-Howard.

23:43.046 --> 23:45.090
How do you feel?
Well, I'm a little drained.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.174
That gentleman's pretty thorough.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.302
Though I must say I didn't find some
of his questions completely pertinent.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.555
Uh... he wouldn't let up
about my load or my weapon

23:51.638 --> 23:53.306
or did I consider myself on duty.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.226
Judas, Frank, that is hardly
the heart of what happened.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.061
You could be at risk here.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.273
Oh, Frank, that death
is an instance for regret,

24:01.356 --> 24:02.649
but it certainly wasn't culpable.

24:02.732 --> 24:05.277
I want you to go home, get an hour's rest,

24:05.360 --> 24:07.779
and then sit down and write
as self-serving a statement

24:07.863 --> 24:09.906
-as you're capable of.
-What are you talking about?

24:09.990 --> 24:12.451
For one thing, I want you to say
you considered yourself off duty.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.953
(laughs) Police officer is never--

24:15.036 --> 24:16.663
Damn it, Howard, say you were off duty.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.085
That'll take some of the curse off
the ammunition you used

24:22.169 --> 24:23.462
and the unauthorized piece.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.842
I think I'm finally getting the gist.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.970
I don't think you have civil
or criminal liability,

24:32.721 --> 24:34.431
but you could lose your badge.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.644
(groans) This department.

24:41.354 --> 24:45.317
Before the enormity of the sphinx
they would discuss the desert heat.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.321
Now, I have something
I have to attend to, Frank.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.698
And then I will try to draft
the appropriate--

24:51.781 --> 24:52.908
Do it, Howard.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.706
Thanks for your concern.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.255
JOYCE: Was there something about
the location of this particular Dumpster

25:07.339 --> 25:09.299
that caught your attention, Detective?

25:09.716 --> 25:11.426
We got part four stalled pretty good.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.888
Schwartzman's driving them nuts
in part two.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.057
He's refusing to plea
to drunk and disorderly.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.725
Where were you situated, Detective,

25:18.808 --> 25:21.394
when you observed my client
ridding himself of the evidence?

25:21.478 --> 25:23.522
I already said that, inside the Dumpster.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.482
I mean where inside the Dumpster?

25:25.565 --> 25:26.775
In the corner.

25:27.943 --> 25:31.071
Besides yourself and the allegedly
deposited evidence,

25:31.154 --> 25:32.864
was there anything else inside?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.950
Yes, there was. Rotting food.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.869
Um, rotting green vegetables.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.581
Rotting broccoli? Rotting asparagus?
Rotting Brussels sprout?

25:41.665 --> 25:45.293
Uh, Ms. Davenport, other than
to the city council vote at four o'clock,

25:45.377 --> 25:48.421
is this line of questioning
leading anywhere at all?

25:48.505 --> 25:49.798
JOYCE: Your Honor, I'm trying

25:49.881 --> 25:51.424
-to lay a foundation for...
-(growling)

25:53.343 --> 25:56.054
-JOYCE: I am trying to lay a foundation--
-I need a recess.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.306
(sighs) All right, five minutes.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.475
Since we're not accomplishing
anything anyway.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.310
And, um, when we resume,

26:02.394 --> 26:05.313
unless defense counsel
can demonstrate the relevance

26:05.397 --> 26:08.608
of this line of questioning's
hyper specificity,

26:08.692 --> 26:10.193
I'll ask her to find a different way

26:10.277 --> 26:13.321
to trivialize and obstruct
these proceedings.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.198
That's hardly my intention.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.577
I think it's exactly your intention.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.078
You're supposed to be
watching the old people.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.455
-We got called in our--
-Mick, our case got transferred--

26:22.539 --> 26:24.040
-So there's nobody out on my stakeout?
-We got all--

26:24.124 --> 26:26.376
-Is that you're saying?
-We had no choice.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.299
Two ounces of marijuana,
you couldn't waive prosecution, right?

26:32.382 --> 26:34.426
It's my third day on the job, Detective.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.469
No one authorized me to null it.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.097
Excuse me. Could I talk to you
for a second, please?

26:39.180 --> 26:41.641
-Excuse us.
-What is it, Detective?

26:42.934 --> 26:45.770
It is a mail delivery of checks
for old people who might get robbed.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.857
I am asking you, please,
play your games with someone else.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.233
They're hardly games.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.987
Representation of 32,000
indigent defendants

26:54.070 --> 26:57.949
every year in this city is easily worth
an extra two hours of your time and mine.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.200
I have to get out of here.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.702
Talk to the city council.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.163
They're the ones that put
both of us in this position.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.126
(growls)

27:12.005 --> 27:14.049
Since he is ever at the ready,

27:15.008 --> 27:16.760
for the truly prepared officer

27:16.843 --> 27:20.930
there is no such thing
as a surprise inspection.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.978
Those boots need a shine, Kregle.

27:33.276 --> 27:37.405
(sighs) It is regrettable to be losing
the battle of the waistline, Mackler.

27:38.198 --> 27:42.202
But unforgiveable to let your posture
concede defeat.

27:42.285 --> 27:43.745
(chuckles)

27:51.211 --> 27:54.506
Gibson? Disassemble that weapon.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.887
Step back, Mackler.

28:07.477 --> 28:10.230
Ten seconds.
That's the low range of acceptable.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.231
(snickers)

28:13.650 --> 28:14.651
As you were, Gibson.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.240
Sullivan.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.409
Reassemble that weapon.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.834
The bolt, Sullivan.
You should be looking for the bolt.

28:34.295 --> 28:37.048
(gun rattling)

28:42.804 --> 28:44.013
Reassembled, sir.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.182
Well done, Sullivan.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.560
Bit hesitant at the beginning.
As you were.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.109
At ease, gentlemen.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.073
All in all, it was not unsatisfactory.

29:03.658 --> 29:07.954
Where appropriate... (clears throat)
you will receive follow up notations.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.540
Detail attention.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.126
At a double time, dismissed.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.763
You may not recall, Frank,
I told you yesterday

29:24.846 --> 29:27.348
that I was going to spring
a surprise inspection.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.479
I think it's important to be consistent.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.898
I think it's important to be thorough.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.693
I think it's important to keep your word.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.240
Howard, go home.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.160
(sighs)

29:52.874 --> 29:55.627
(lively music playing)

30:13.728 --> 30:15.897
-That's it, babe. It's history.
-Get in the car.

30:29.035 --> 30:32.330
Oh, man, are we going to get
our ashes hauled for waiting on this one.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.289
Shut up.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.379
I don't believe this.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.599
Maybe it was a dream.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.812
The dream lives.

31:04.112 --> 31:07.657
Don't you want to continue your farcical
line of questioning, Ms. Davenport?

31:07.740 --> 31:08.992
Just a moment, Your Honor.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.120
JUDGE:
Come on, come on. Don't you get it?

31:12.203 --> 31:16.124
Mr. Santana is telling you
the city council voted no.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.251
Feeling pretty chipper,
are we, Mr. Santana?

31:18.334 --> 31:19.711
Looking forward to the strike?

31:19.794 --> 31:21.087
Looking forward to doing
what has to be done, Your Honor.

31:21.170 --> 31:22.338
Can I Get out of here?

31:22.422 --> 31:23.840
Defense requests an adjournment,
Your Honor.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.300
On what grounds?

31:26.718 --> 31:27.552
Personal emergency.

31:27.635 --> 31:30.138
-What emergency?
-I'm feeling unwell.

31:30.221 --> 31:33.391
In what way? Be more specific.

31:36.352 --> 31:37.729
May it please the court,

31:38.813 --> 31:41.983
section 1053.2 of the civil code states

31:42.066 --> 31:44.235
that if after commencement of a hearing

31:44.319 --> 31:47.155
of a criminal action
or proceeding in any court,

31:47.238 --> 31:50.158
the attorney for the defense
or the prosecution,

31:50.241 --> 31:53.369
for reasons of sudden illness
or personal emergency

31:53.453 --> 31:54.704
be unable to proceed,

31:54.787 --> 31:57.457
the presiding judge
shall grant an adjournment.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.750
You had that memorized?

31:58.833 --> 32:01.002
I request action on my motion, Your Honor.

32:01.085 --> 32:01.920
Judge.

32:02.003 --> 32:04.130
I'm sorry you've been made
a casualty, Detective,

32:04.213 --> 32:09.177
but you see, Ms. Davenport's
four and one half hours

32:09.260 --> 32:10.887
of prima donna posturing

32:10.970 --> 32:13.806
have caused problems for a lot of us.

32:13.890 --> 32:17.602
I think not least for her client.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.520
You're going to enjoy staying
in the hoosegow

32:19.604 --> 32:22.357
till your new counsel is appointed,
Mr. Rodriguez.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.233
Where are you going, Ms. Davenport?

32:24.317 --> 32:26.819
You're not conducting
court business any longer.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.030
But I make that determination.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.408
Turn around, Joycie,
or I'm going to hit you with contempt.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.243
You're the one who's behavior
is contemptable.

32:34.494 --> 32:35.703
Cited for contempt!

32:43.670 --> 32:44.671
You bastard.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.590
Strike really could be
rough on you, huh, Joyce.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.051
You may have to dip into the trust fund.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.428
Maybe start a new firm for dilatants.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.805
(crowd gasps)

32:55.473 --> 32:56.307
(chuckles)

32:59.018 --> 33:00.019
Drop contempt.

33:01.562 --> 33:03.481
Cite her for battery. Bailiff.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.540
-(TV playing in distance)
-(baby crying)

34:00.663 --> 34:01.622
Yeah?

34:02.331 --> 34:04.584
-James Wingate?
-Yeah.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.377
Police Lieutenant Howard Hunter.

34:06.627 --> 34:09.005
Hey, I'm clean, man. I'm totally clean.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.132
You can go ask my parole officer.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.385
-I'm here about your brother.
-I didn't run with Amos.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.596
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.017
I'm the police officer
that shot your brother, James.

34:22.435 --> 34:23.269
May I come in?

34:33.529 --> 34:35.656
-Amos is dead?
-Yes.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.367
Try to shoot you?

34:39.494 --> 34:42.497
-He would have, yes.
-Uh-huh.

34:45.291 --> 34:49.754
I want to pledge to you, James,
that for the rest of my life,

34:50.797 --> 34:53.966
I will try to be worthy
of the deed that I did today.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.134
Say what?

34:56.052 --> 34:58.805
Before the White man came,
the inhabitants of this continent

34:58.888 --> 35:01.933
would bathe their young warriors
in the blood of their first kill.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.644
That was to teach them
that they must ever after

35:04.727 --> 35:06.020
with their conduct honor--

35:06.104 --> 35:08.314
Would you get your ever after out of here?

35:09.524 --> 35:12.443
My taking your brother's life
was necessary, James,

35:12.527 --> 35:13.986
-but it was not done lightly--
-You get out!

35:19.826 --> 35:22.829
-I had hoped that it might be of some--
-Fifty bucks.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.290
-Excuse me?
-You want me to trick

35:26.374 --> 35:30.211
so you can feel better,
than you give me 50 dollars.

35:31.337 --> 35:32.922
(mutters) I, uh--

35:34.006 --> 35:36.259
I-I don't think
you understand my intentions.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.219
You give it up, baby, or get out.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.557
You gonna have to pay
to keep your rap going in here.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.353
Come in here wanting me
to listen to you talk

35:47.687 --> 35:49.230
so you can feel better.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.523
I'm a busy man.

35:50.606 --> 35:55.153
I ain't got time to listen to you talk
about how you killed my brother.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.572
Yeah, get out.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.658
Next time you come, you bring paper.

36:01.826 --> 36:06.038
You got the dime, then I got the time.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.879
I am sorry for your loss.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.973
(indistinct chatter)

36:39.739 --> 36:42.241
-(horn honks)
-No good?

36:43.784 --> 36:45.745
One of those guys says
he copped here around noon.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.623
-Maybe he'll come back.
-He's dead.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.792
What do you mean?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.420
Not the guy we're looking for,
the lieutenant.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.339
The one that helped you out this morning.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.090
(scoffs)

36:58.674 --> 36:59.634
Cop puts a perp down,

36:59.717 --> 37:02.094
he better be wearing a tie
and clean underpants.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.806
Downtown's always saying,
"Oh, yeah. We're behind you."

37:05.890 --> 37:07.391
Then all of a sudden, "Look at this.

37:07.475 --> 37:10.603
You forgot to cross this T,
this, uh, I here ain't dotted.

37:10.686 --> 37:11.938
Gotta have your badge."

37:12.021 --> 37:13.272
-MAN: Hey!
-There.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.155
-You sure that's him?
-I'm sure.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.327
Come on, cop, you piece of garbage.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.328
What are you waiting for?

37:27.411 --> 37:28.621
I want to catch him dirty.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.122
Help the lieutenant out more.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.086
The scum wad made me. Lie down.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.311
Police! Come on, do something wrong!

37:52.395 --> 37:53.229
Come on!

37:54.146 --> 37:56.857
Man, they're up, man. It's all over.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.819
House in the armory
till private attorneys can be hired.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.280
All intake interviews
will be conducted there.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.740
Oh, try to note in their file folders,

38:04.824 --> 38:07.910
all those close
to the 72-hour detention limit.

38:08.494 --> 38:11.372
Right, Captain. In terms of new arrests--

38:11.455 --> 38:13.541
All but class one
get settled in the street.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.918
(chuckles) It's gonna be no good.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.629
Before he gets around
it'll be Disneyland out there.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.964
Uh... Stan.

38:20.798 --> 38:21.799
Hey, hi, Stosh.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.802
-Uh... Hi, Guy.
-Hey, Stosh,

38:25.386 --> 38:27.221
-look what you're leaving me with here.
-Yeah.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.519
Captain, I'm going to tell you this
without any BS or anything else.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.397
Now, I haven't had a twinge
or anything like it

38:36.480 --> 38:38.983
since three-- since before
three o'clock this afternoon.

38:39.066 --> 38:41.527
Stan, you're not the first cop
who tried to die on the beat.

38:43.154 --> 38:46.949
I've watched you drink 15 cups of coffee
and lift cartons and wade into fights.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.660
I'm not gonna let you do it that way.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.538
This where I get the lecture on how
I still got a lot to live for, Captain?

38:52.621 --> 38:55.750
No lecture. But if you try to come in
for work tomorrow,

38:56.208 --> 38:58.419
I'm going to have you retired
for physical impairment.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.845
Listen up, everybody.

39:09.388 --> 39:10.473
Uh, li-listen up.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.316
There's no way to say this but to say it.

39:24.236 --> 39:25.446
I'm not gonna be here anymore.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.492
It's not that I don't wanna be, I...

39:30.451 --> 39:32.161
It's just that my body won't permit.

39:35.164 --> 39:36.374
I'm going in for surgery.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.252
I hope to see you all afterwards.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.504
No farewells.

39:46.008 --> 39:46.926
It's been a privilege.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.761
Everybody get back to work.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.067
-Ms. Davenport on 2-7, Captain.
-Thank you.

40:03.609 --> 40:06.362
HENRY: Smeltzer, 50. Heart of gold.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.572
Jacobs, you want a receipt for that?

40:09.115 --> 40:11.242
She's good for it, I promise.
I got you down.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.662
-NORMAN: Gerald Smith, book him.
-Lieutenant.

40:16.831 --> 40:17.832
Can I talk to you a moment?

40:19.500 --> 40:22.211
Unless it's a class A felony,
we're giving the perp some rhythm.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.129
Book him.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.509
Norm, how much dough can you spare?

40:28.592 --> 40:29.885
Captain's wife got arrested.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.679
You sure he wants to get her out, huh?

40:32.972 --> 40:36.892
<i>Just how the public defender strike</i>
<i>will affect the city is uncertain.</i>

40:37.268 --> 40:39.728
<i>But experts are predicting</i>
<i>long court delays</i>

40:39.812 --> 40:42.231
<i>and much confusion</i>
<i>throughout the legal system.</i>

40:42.314 --> 40:45.734
I swear, Robert, I would
throw their striking heinies in jail.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.695
-(news report on TV continues)
-No room.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.655
Bunch of rich babies.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.991
Renko, they make less than we do.

40:53.242 --> 40:57.288
Still again, they swore a solemn oath
which they have now broke.

40:58.038 --> 41:03.085
I seem to remember a whole bunch of cops
getting the flu bug all at the same time

41:03.169 --> 41:04.670
a couple years ago, Renko.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.341
I just don't like people who wear suits.

41:09.758 --> 41:11.552
(laughs)

41:14.430 --> 41:16.265
At least we picked
a good time to screw up.

41:17.099 --> 41:19.518
All this heat coming down
'cause of the PDs going out.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.271
Maybe nobody will notice
that we blew the undercover.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.734
Hey, she really got to you, didn't she?

41:27.526 --> 41:30.404
I swear to you, Neal,
I felt like it was kismet.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.865
Like something
that didn't have anything to do

41:32.948 --> 41:34.992
with ordinary rules or sense.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.537
Like she just materialized
in that store for me

41:38.621 --> 41:41.040
to see her through my camera.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.792
-Man, I don't believe this.
-What?

41:44.710 --> 41:47.046
You call me tomorrow, okay? Okay?

41:49.507 --> 41:50.466
You got the guy.

42:04.438 --> 42:06.607
Sorry, sweetheart, I'm a cop.
You're busted.

42:06.982 --> 42:08.817
Now, if you got to piece,
just slide it under.

42:12.571 --> 42:14.740
-You're a cop?
-WOMAN: I'm a cop.

42:14.823 --> 42:16.534
On a buy sting from Division.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.036
Fence undercover from the Hill.

42:21.121 --> 42:24.750
-Detective J.D. LaRue.
-Officer Tina Russo.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.381
(chuckles) Hi. I...

42:31.590 --> 42:33.551
meet all my dates in here.

42:35.553 --> 42:40.057
So, you, uh, bought my
sleazeball act this afternoon?

42:41.892 --> 42:42.768
Completely.

42:54.613 --> 42:55.906
Where's the PD's meeting?

42:57.241 --> 42:58.784
Danny Santana's apartment.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.289
At least Wachtel let me make bail.

43:04.164 --> 43:06.250
I can't believe he'll pursue the charge.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.335
His own conduct was too unprofessional.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.297
(sobs) I knew he was trying to goad me,

43:11.880 --> 43:13.257
make it ad hominem,

43:14.258 --> 43:16.635
but I just couldn't stop myself
from reacting.

43:19.179 --> 43:24.101
When, uh, Danny and the others
came into the court room

43:24.602 --> 43:26.395
and I knew we were going to strike...

43:29.189 --> 43:31.984
I tried to think of the clients
I hadn't defended yet.

43:32.234 --> 43:35.571
The ones who are going to get the quality
of representation they deserve

43:35.654 --> 43:37.489
because of what we were going to do.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.158
(sighs)

43:40.117 --> 43:41.910
But all I could see was my client's eyes,

43:41.994 --> 43:45.497
and I kept trying to tell myself
I wasn't betraying his trust.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.753
-(indistinct chatter)
-(radio chatter)

43:57.843 --> 43:59.762
Rob assault, Captain. Victim just died.

43:59.845 --> 44:02.931
-White male, looked like his mid-70s.
-FRANK: Thank you.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.226
I told her, let me go.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.979
-She had to play games.
-FRANK: That's enough, Mick.

44:15.527 --> 44:17.029
Maybe it wouldn't have happened, Captain.

44:17.112 --> 44:19.448
FRANK: No proof this was connected
with your undercover.

44:21.742 --> 44:22.993
Maybe I could have stopped it.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.511
You take the car.
I'm going to have to stay here a while.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.854
Warren, why would Howard
try to intimidate him?

44:50.938 --> 44:52.648
His brother had nothing to do
with the case.

44:54.858 --> 44:57.361
He went there because he was trying
to explain what happened.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.487
(knocking on door)

45:00.030 --> 45:01.407
Well, he says he's working on it.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.244
I don't know if he's going to submit one.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.456
Look, Warren, I don't want to lose my cop.

45:10.582 --> 45:13.377
I mean, I hope any personal animosity
between us will--

45:14.002 --> 45:16.213
Okay. Before anyone else, huh?

45:16.922 --> 45:17.756
Thank you.

45:18.674 --> 45:19.508
Stan.

45:20.008 --> 45:21.301
Yeah, thanks.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.011
Is-is that about the lieutenant?

45:25.764 --> 45:27.057
Uh, sorry to bother you, Captain.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.351
I just, uh, felt I needed
somebody to talk to.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.270
-You feel all right?
-Oh, yeah.

45:32.229 --> 45:33.939
Funny thing is, I don't feel so bad.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.024
Except, you know, when it grabs me.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.651
You got to have it taken care of, Stan.

45:37.735 --> 45:38.569
I'm going to.

45:39.778 --> 45:40.696
I'm going to.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.617
I used to be so afraid of hospitals.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.787
Before my wife Helen got sick,
I'd never go inside.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.040
Now you know what I'm scared of, Captain?

45:56.170 --> 45:57.296
I'm scared I'm going to live.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.385
I'm scared I'm gonna go in,
they're going to operate,

46:03.469 --> 46:06.388
I'm gonna live, and I'm gonna
sit by myself at that apartment.

46:09.057 --> 46:10.768
I'll be an old man sitting by myself.

46:10.851 --> 46:13.395
-That's not going to happen, Stan.
-God, I hate crying.

46:13.979 --> 46:15.814
You have friends. Everybody cares for you.

46:15.898 --> 46:17.858
Captain, can I stay?

46:18.442 --> 46:19.735
Can I keep on working? Please.

46:26.575 --> 46:27.576
Sorry.

46:28.869 --> 46:31.079
-Didn't mean to put you in a position.
-No, that's all right.

46:33.415 --> 46:34.958
Act like a man for a while.

46:36.668 --> 46:37.711
Wind up a little boy again.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.671
Don't say that. You're still a man.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.591
Hmm. It's hard to get things
through a Polish noggin.

46:50.849 --> 46:52.559
-Where's Ms. Davenport?
-At a PD's meeting.

46:52.643 --> 46:56.146
That strike goes on any length of time,
that's going to be hell on us, Captain.

46:57.439 --> 47:01.276
Stan. You'll never need
an excuse to come here.

47:03.987 --> 47:05.906
-No fun, are they?
-What's that?

47:07.241 --> 47:08.200
Empty places.

47:11.745 --> 47:13.914
-Good night.
-Good night, Stan.

48:02.087 --> 48:05.090
(closing theme playing)
