00:06.923 --> 00:09.843
[mysterious music]

00:09.884 --> 00:17.058
* *

00:58.141 --> 00:59.976
[siren wailing in distance]

01:00.018 --> 01:01.811
- Do you really not see
how sick this is?

01:01.853 --> 01:03.688
- I really don't.
- That you would appropriate

01:03.730 --> 01:06.441
a missing child's thoughts,
his fears

01:06.483 --> 01:07.776
for your career advancement.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.194
- How many times
do I have to say this?

01:09.235 --> 01:10.570
We were working on an essay.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.781
- But why didn't you tell
Nora and Leonard

01:12.822 --> 01:14.949
that Vincent
was having these feelings?

01:14.991 --> 01:16.284
Why didn't you tell the police?

01:16.326 --> 01:17.952
- I wrote the letters.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.455
Donya, are you hearing me?

01:20.497 --> 01:21.915
Donya?

01:21.956 --> 01:23.249
Not Vincent.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.710
[unsettling music]

01:25.752 --> 01:30.006
- You wrote what he was saying
and feeling and--

01:30.048 --> 01:33.259
- What I perceived him
to be feeling and thinking.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.595
- You said you drew on him.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.682
And for some of this stuff,
he did write them, okay?

01:38.723 --> 01:41.893
This is his handwriting, okay?
For fuck's sake, Zack.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.605
- We worked on an essay
for his college applications.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.233
I asked him to
dig into himself, he did.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.235
How many times
do I need to tell you this?

01:50.276 --> 01:53.154
* *

01:53.196 --> 01:54.447
- Yeah, then you dug into him.

01:54.489 --> 01:58.451
- Meaning what exactly, huh?

01:58.493 --> 02:02.122
- Meaning that you had
knowledge of his despair,

02:02.163 --> 02:03.790
his urge to run away.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.959
And you didn't tell
his parents?

02:06.001 --> 02:07.502
You didn't tell the detective?

02:07.544 --> 02:10.463
- The detec--that detective
didn't earn my trust.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.258
- Didn't earn your trust?

02:13.299 --> 02:15.135
Are you kidding?

02:15.176 --> 02:19.806
Vincent could be out there
lying in a ditch somewhere.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.725
You withheld information.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.810
I mean,
you're still withholding.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.855
I mean, what the fuck, Zack?
- I did not and do not

02:26.896 --> 02:29.524
have any actual information.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.651
I have my perception
of what was going--

02:31.693 --> 02:33.778
- Oh, cut the shit!
- Let me finish!

02:33.820 --> 02:38.491
* *

02:38.533 --> 02:42.954
Do you have any idea
the pressure of fatherhood--

02:42.996 --> 02:44.956
the oppressive fear of failure,

02:44.998 --> 02:48.418
the--the desperation
that comes along with that?

02:48.460 --> 02:51.171
* *

02:51.212 --> 02:55.175
- Yeah. It can make you wanna
fuck me in the bathtub.

02:55.216 --> 03:00.472
* *

03:00.513 --> 03:04.351
- That was a mean thing to say.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.894
And you're not a mean person.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.188
* *

03:08.229 --> 03:10.231
- Vincent's missing.
He could be dead.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.483
But hey, if it helps
your writing--

03:11.524 --> 03:13.026
- Shut the fuck up!

03:13.068 --> 03:15.862
[baby crying]

03:15.904 --> 03:19.282
* *

03:19.324 --> 03:21.868
I do not like
where you and I are at.

03:21.910 --> 03:27.165
* *

03:27.207 --> 03:28.875
- [exhales]

03:28.917 --> 03:30.835
[crying continues]

03:30.877 --> 03:37.801
* *

04:15.964 --> 04:17.882
- Vincent appeared.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.469
He came to me.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.929
- Did he tell you where he is?

04:22.971 --> 04:25.056
- Okay, we have looked
at every security camera

04:25.098 --> 04:27.100
on the route
to Vincent's school, right?

04:27.142 --> 04:30.937
The cameras show he walks
the same route every day.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.023
But not this day.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.942
My feeling is that Vincent
never left that building

04:35.984 --> 04:37.777
on Tuesday morning.

04:37.819 --> 04:42.407
He's contained,
maybe still in there,

04:42.449 --> 04:44.909
alive.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.953
Perhaps not,

04:46.995 --> 04:49.622
but there.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.667
- And you got all of that
from this?

04:52.709 --> 04:55.128
[soft dramatic music]

04:55.170 --> 04:58.840
- I felt from the start that
the building is speaking to us.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.260
* *

05:02.302 --> 05:03.762
We need to search it.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.472
- Ah,
and we've arrived at the Avi

05:05.513 --> 05:09.100
the captain doesn't
want you to emulate.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.395
- You're gonna need a warrant,
which this won't get you.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.939
Though it is lovely.
What is that? A pike?

05:14.981 --> 05:17.484
- Captain, I feel strongly
that I'm right.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.818
- Well, Avi, for now,

05:18.860 --> 05:22.655
let's just check
our feelings at the door.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.033
Next time,
bring me some evidence.

05:25.075 --> 05:29.412
* *

05:35.460 --> 05:36.878
- It is a bit bat shitty.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.421
And should you turn out
to be right,

05:38.463 --> 05:40.048
it's even more bat shitty,
right,

05:40.090 --> 05:43.093
that you found the truth
in a--is it a cod?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.804
It looked like a cod.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.263
- You have to allow
for the truth

05:47.305 --> 05:48.973
to take unconventional paths.

05:49.015 --> 05:53.353
You've read "De Anima"?
- Aristotle, yeah, in college.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.438
- It talks about
the five senses.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.940
Well, he was wrong.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.442
There are scientists today
that say we have more than 20.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.653
Some say more than 30.

06:01.695 --> 06:06.074
Tongues can smell,
our noses can taste.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.244
Our eyes can hear,
but we need to listen.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.958
And we need to search
that building.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.711
- Well, we don't have enough
for a warrant.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.755
So we could try
for a consent search.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.466
- Yes. We'll get the occupants
to invite us in.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.635
I'm a nice person.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.595
You're a nice person.
- Okay, seriously,

06:27.637 --> 06:29.931
do you think he's in there?

06:32.225 --> 06:36.604
- All I know is
the building speaks to me.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.733
[children laughing]

06:40.859 --> 06:43.987
[soft dramatic music]

06:44.029 --> 06:50.952
* *

06:54.164 --> 06:55.540
I'm Detective Avraham.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.834
We met on Wednesday.
- I remember.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.880
- Do you know where Vincent is?

07:01.921 --> 07:04.758
- Uh--if I did,
why wouldn't I tell you?

07:04.799 --> 07:08.094
- My sense is,
you can choose not to be heard.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.221
When your husband
spoke of Vincent's father,

07:10.263 --> 07:13.099
calling him mercurial,
aggressive,

07:13.141 --> 07:14.768
you neither agreed
nor disagreed.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.728
You stayed quiet.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.147
You're not keeping
anything from us?

07:19.189 --> 07:24.069
- Detective, if you have
something to ask me, ask it.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.738
- Why did your husband stop
being Vincent's tutor?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.784
- I'm not exactly sure.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.119
Eh--neither is Zack.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.373
- Mrs. Miller,
a boy is missing.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.875
And for some reason,
people who are close to him,

07:38.917 --> 07:42.087
people who care about him,
are withholding.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.136
- According to Vincent,

07:50.178 --> 07:54.015
his father had questions
about Zack's sexuality,

07:54.057 --> 07:57.102
which, of course,
is ridiculous.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.978
It--

07:59.020 --> 08:02.732
he also had questions
about Vincent's sexuality.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.235
This, again,
according to Vincent.

08:05.276 --> 08:11.950
And he was worried about
Zack's possible influence.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.452
- These questions
regarding his sexuality,

08:14.494 --> 08:15.745
do you share them?

08:15.787 --> 08:18.289
- About Zack?
- Uh, Vincent.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.793
- Uh, not really.

08:21.835 --> 08:26.715
* *

08:26.756 --> 08:28.299
- You know,
I sit in Vincent's room,

08:28.341 --> 08:30.051
which helps me to feel him,

08:30.093 --> 08:34.264
which I hope
will help me to find him.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.266
- What do you mean?

08:36.307 --> 08:38.101
- I can't explain
the science of it.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.354
Sometimes it works,
sometimes not.

08:41.396 --> 08:44.441
Vincent spent a lot of time
in your apartment

08:44.482 --> 08:46.109
during his tutoring.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.236
Would you mind if I come
and sit for a few minutes?

08:50.321 --> 08:54.367
- Uh, I'll talk to Zack.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.828
- Could Vincent have had
a relationship with Zack?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.455
- Donya just said that Leonard
had concerns

08:58.496 --> 09:01.207
about Zack's sexuality
and also about Vincent's.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.293
- Okay, and why didn't
she say anything before?

09:03.335 --> 09:05.670
- Well, she didn't think
it was relevant.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.839
- Wouldn't it just be easier
if people told us everything

09:07.881 --> 09:09.674
and let us decide
what's relevant?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.011
- You would think.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.847
- Avi, can I ask you something?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.057
- I'll just be a minute.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.475
- Okay.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.809
[door shuts]

09:25.982 --> 09:27.317
- This store is
on the same block?

09:27.359 --> 09:29.361
- About 300 yards
from his apartment building.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.112
And look, you can see
they're clearly

09:31.154 --> 09:32.697
having a conversation,
right there.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.282
And then--
- What's the book?

09:34.324 --> 09:36.659
- I--I can't tell.
I can make out the word "push."

09:36.701 --> 09:38.870
That's it.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
- So Wentworth and Vincent
know each other?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.040
- Yeah.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.958
After he told me
they'd never met.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.170
- And he's in
interrogation now?

09:47.212 --> 09:49.005
- He is. And I'd like to have
a go at him first.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.216
Avi can come in after,
if we need him.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.762
This guy lied to me.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.847
* *

09:57.889 --> 09:59.516
Thank you.

09:59.557 --> 10:06.439
* *

10:10.443 --> 10:11.319
- He wants to come here?

10:12.987 --> 10:15.699
- He says it might help
to feel him,

10:15.740 --> 10:18.410
which in turn could help
to find him.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.746
He's a very odd person.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.331
- He suspects me of something.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.710
- My guess is,
he suspects everyone.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.087
His process.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.089
- Right.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.385
And your process?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.187
- I have a hard time
reconciling

10:46.229 --> 10:49.691
you sitting on information,

10:49.733 --> 10:53.278
however much it helps
your creativity.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.745
- We have a class tonight,

11:01.786 --> 11:04.039
where guests are invited
to come listen to our readings.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.666
I'd really like you to come,

11:06.708 --> 11:09.461
if we can find a sitter.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.796
I'd like you to actually see

11:11.838 --> 11:15.133
what my creative world
is about.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.722
Donya, one reason that people
start to grow apart

11:20.764 --> 11:22.932
and get lonely
is that they stop

11:22.974 --> 11:26.394
making a concerted effort
to get each other.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.688
Sometimes it doesn't
come naturally.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.523
Sometimes it takes
work and effort.

11:32.025 --> 11:36.404
My life is you, Luke,

11:36.446 --> 11:39.199
and my writing.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.330
I'd really like for you
to come to my class tonight.

11:45.372 --> 11:52.087
* *

11:52.128 --> 11:54.798
- Sure, I'll come.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.551
* *

12:02.555 --> 12:04.683
- [humming softly]

12:04.724 --> 12:07.018
- What did the minyan say?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.312
Are we getting any closer?

12:09.354 --> 12:11.147
- I actually do have
a sense of humor,

12:11.189 --> 12:12.357
but not when it comes to

12:12.399 --> 12:14.192
making fun of
a person's religion.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.945
- First of all, you need
to get over yourself.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.154
And second of all,

12:18.196 --> 12:20.657
we've pulled over twice,
and counting,

12:20.699 --> 12:23.910
on this case alone,
so that you can pray.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.205
So you kind of opened
the door for me.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.166
Is there a melding
between Judaism

12:30.208 --> 12:33.795
and Aristotle's sensorium
that I didn't know about?

12:33.837 --> 12:36.172
- You mean to be funny now?
- No.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.968
I'm trying to better understand
my partner.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.761
And I'd like
to visit your temple.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.096
- It's a shul, not temple.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.390
- Okay, shul.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.641
Take me.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.184
- The men worship separately
from the women,

12:48.226 --> 12:49.310
so you'd need
a woman to take you.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.895
You'd also have
to dress modestly,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.355
covering your arms and legs.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.607
The service is in Hebrew,
and there is no participation.

12:54.649 --> 12:55.859
You still wanna go?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.986
- I'm sure there are
less strict shuls

12:58.028 --> 12:59.904
you could take me to,
if you really wanted.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.322
- If I wanted, but I don't.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.575
- But you have to
want to take me.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.537
You're commanded to care
for the stranger.

13:07.579 --> 13:10.540
It's the most repeated
commandment in the Torah.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.126
36 different times
the Torah says,

13:13.168 --> 13:15.128
"You must welcome,

13:15.170 --> 13:18.214
"feed, love, teach,

13:18.256 --> 13:21.426
and worship with the stranger."

13:23.261 --> 13:26.348
And here I am, a stranger.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.059
So are you going to do
the right thing

13:29.100 --> 13:32.145
as commanded by God or not?

13:32.187 --> 13:35.106
[soft music]

13:35.148 --> 13:37.734
* *

13:37.776 --> 13:39.402
Hm.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.405
- This is exactly why
I prefer to work alone.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.615
- Mm.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.755
- This pisses me off.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.382
- So I encountered him
in a store.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.633
We live in
the same neighborhood,

14:01.675 --> 14:03.843
patronize many of
the same establishments.

14:03.885 --> 14:04.928
- Oh.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.304
- What's the big deal?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.598
- You met Vincent Conte,
and you told me you didn't.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.933
You even bought him a book.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.520
- I'd like a lawyer.
- Yeah, I didn't hear that.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.647
'Cause if I did, I'd have to
stop all this right now

14:15.689 --> 14:17.982
and get you a lawyer and
you know what'd happen then.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.567
Your lawyer, he or she,
would come in here

14:19.609 --> 14:21.778
and tell you not to talk to us.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.655
And that would leave us
with the following:

14:23.697 --> 14:25.240
We've got a 16-year-old
missing boy,

14:25.281 --> 14:27.158
last seen with you,
a homeless man

14:27.200 --> 14:28.660
of questionable mental health,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.745
someone who was broomed from
his previous teaching career

14:30.787 --> 14:33.206
for teaching Heidegger
and being a Nazi.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.250
You don't exactly
present well, John.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.002
You see,
when a child goes missing,

14:37.043 --> 14:38.503
we have to offer up a suspect,

14:38.545 --> 14:41.172
any suspect,
if it comes to that.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.925
And I got news for you, bro.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.510
You'll do.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.846
And if you lawyer up
and you stop talking,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.347
guess what?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.433
[tense music]

14:51.474 --> 14:53.685
You become the suspect.

14:53.727 --> 15:00.400
* *

15:00.442 --> 15:03.695
- I'm exercising my right
to have an attorney present.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.740
- Hang tight.

15:06.781 --> 15:10.035
* *

15:10.076 --> 15:12.328
[door opens]

15:13.913 --> 15:15.582
- Olivia.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.625
I was hoping to see you here.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.503
- I was hoping you'd be
looking for my brother.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.839
- I am, in fact.
Do you know where he is?

15:22.881 --> 15:25.800
- My dad thinks
you're hot for my mom.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.470
Is that true?
- It isn't.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.638
What I am is drawn.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.850
I get drawn
to compelling people.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.394
And what I find most compelling
about your mother

15:36.436 --> 15:38.396
is that I sense she wants
to tell me something

15:38.438 --> 15:40.732
she's not telling me.
[door shuts]

15:40.774 --> 15:43.401
And I find you to be
a bit compelling too, Olivia.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.527
[footsteps approaching]

15:44.569 --> 15:45.904
- What the hell's wrong
with you?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.405
We're worried sick about
our son, her brother,

15:47.447 --> 15:50.575
and you come here--go ahead.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.160
You come here
and you taunt her,

15:52.202 --> 15:53.953
and you bait us?

15:53.995 --> 15:58.166
I think you're a sick person,
Detective, sadistic even.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.377
- A feeling I know, Mr. Conte.
- I've had enough.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.379
I want you off
this investigation.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.507
- It's not your case.
It's mine.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.925
If you'll excuse me,

16:06.966 --> 16:08.968
I have an appointment
with the Millers.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.783
- Can I get you a water
or some coffee?

16:31.825 --> 16:35.078
- No, thank you.
I'm just gonna sit.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.126
- So you're looking
to feel exactly what?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.503
- Vincent.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.007
- Okay.

16:49.718 --> 16:53.847
- It helps to close my eyes.
I don't mean to be rude.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.018
- [quietly] Got it.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.983
[light tense music]

17:05.025 --> 17:11.948
* *

17:18.121 --> 17:20.331
- So did you feel him?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.375
- Some.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.627
Mainly, I felt that
she's still withholding.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.171
- Donya?
- Mm-hmm.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.340
- Hmm.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.674
- Thank you.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.427
- At the risk
of pissing you off

17:32.469 --> 17:33.970
and getting to know you better,

17:34.012 --> 17:37.974
have--have you always
been super religious?

17:38.016 --> 17:40.352
- That question is not suitable
for work.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.689
- I wanna learn how you
do your job, how you think.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.026
- I think like a cop.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.363
You know, I'm not the only
orthodox Jew in the NYPD.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.656
- Why did you become a cop?

17:53.698 --> 17:55.533
You know my origin story,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.660
"Law & Order."
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.455
- So what's yours?

18:00.497 --> 18:02.624
- I'm a Jew.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.335
I was taught my job
on Earth is to do mitzvahs.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.753
- Hmm.

18:06.795 --> 18:10.215
- Good deeds help repair
a broken world.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.050
Tikkun olam.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.430
So I became a police officer
to do good deeds.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.978
It's not the only reason.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.275
My father was murdered.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.403
[soft dramatic music]

18:31.444 --> 18:33.363
It was never solved.

18:33.405 --> 18:38.159
* *

18:44.082 --> 18:45.583
- Yeah, I get the link
between genius and madness.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.836
But he's always drawing fish.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.006
- Well, those drawings
aren't really about fish.

18:51.047 --> 18:54.384
Van Gogh used to paint flowers.
They were never about flowers.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.261
- Van Gogh chopped
his own ear off.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.680
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

18:58.722 --> 19:01.558
- So do you agree
that Avi's crazy?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.977
- No, that's not what I'm--
um--

19:04.853 --> 19:07.689
Mortals like us
aren't meant to understand it.

19:07.731 --> 19:10.692
He's not divining anything.
It's intuition.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.153
He's got no direct line to God.

19:13.194 --> 19:16.197
- Yeah, well, I bet Avi
would beg to differ.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.659
- My wife dragged me to The Met

19:19.701 --> 19:22.162
to see this artist,
Caspar David Friedrich.

19:22.203 --> 19:26.499
And, uh, his art
supposedly is about God.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.043
But in looking at it,
I--I don't know,

19:28.084 --> 19:31.212
I didn't see a whole lot of God
going on, all right?

19:31.254 --> 19:35.216
But he uses his art
to express Him.

19:35.258 --> 19:39.721
And Avi uses his art
to discover shit.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.223
- That doesn't strike you
as a form of insanity?

19:42.265 --> 19:44.476
- [chuckles]

19:44.517 --> 19:46.686
Everybody's insane.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.396
Come on, you know that.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.232
- "My earliest memory
was wanting to fly,

19:51.274 --> 19:53.777
"like a bird,

19:53.818 --> 19:58.114
"to soar above
and just feel the air.

19:59.949 --> 20:06.164
"I think it was my first
construct of joy--flight.

20:06.206 --> 20:10.627
"And as I grew,
desire became need.

20:10.669 --> 20:14.589
"Need became compulsion,

20:14.631 --> 20:16.758
"which became freedom.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.514
"Fly, little bird, fly.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.974
"I am free.

20:25.016 --> 20:28.770
"Pain gives way to flight.

20:28.812 --> 20:33.358
And I am free, at last."

20:40.532 --> 20:43.827
[light applause]

20:46.121 --> 20:49.874
- So this boy,
he took his life?

20:49.916 --> 20:52.377
- That's one interpretation.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.129
- Well, is there another?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.964
- Not to me.

20:56.006 --> 20:59.592
He talks about
flying and freedom.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.845
He jumped.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.223
- I'm not sure
I like this piece anymore.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.183
It's upsetting.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.479
[soft dark music]

21:11.521 --> 21:18.319
* *

21:18.361 --> 21:21.656
- Why did you lie to us
about never having met Vincent?

21:21.698 --> 21:28.830
* *

21:29.581 --> 21:30.832
I asked you a question,

21:30.874 --> 21:32.834
and I think I'm entitled
to an answer.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.336
- I lied because
of the very bigotry

21:34.377 --> 21:36.838
your detective colleague
tried to weaponize.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.423
If I'm so much
as deemed a suspect,

21:38.465 --> 21:40.133
that's a bell
that never gets unrung.

21:40.175 --> 21:44.429
- You have made yourself
a suspect by lying.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.513
- You people have to stop

21:45.555 --> 21:49.476
putting these thoughts
into my head.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.562
- What was the book?
You gave him a book.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.898
We could make out
the word "push."

21:54.939 --> 21:58.276
There was a movie
of that book, "Push."

21:58.318 --> 22:00.862
It was called "Pressure as a
Child of Abusive Parenting,"

22:00.904 --> 22:02.864
as I recall.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.533
- Such splendid detective work.

22:05.575 --> 22:08.912
Pushkin.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.664
I gave him a book
by Alexander Pushkin.

22:11.706 --> 22:16.670
I'll probably get cancelled
for teaching him as well.

22:16.711 --> 22:20.131
- I like Pushkin.

22:20.173 --> 22:23.718
He wrote a lot about revenge

22:23.760 --> 22:27.347
and death.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.891
- And sympathy.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.268
You left that out.

Zack.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.815
You scared me.

25:23.857 --> 25:26.151
- What are you doing?

25:26.985 --> 25:30.280
- I just--

25:30.321 --> 25:34.117
while I was feeding Luke,
I thought about this book

25:34.159 --> 25:37.162
that I had started
and hadn't finished.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.538
Just came down to look for it.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.875
- What book?

25:41.916 --> 25:43.251
- What are you doing?

25:43.293 --> 25:45.503
- I woke up and
you weren't in the bed.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.381
I came out, and you were
nowhere to be found.

25:48.423 --> 25:51.176
So I came looking for you.

25:51.217 --> 25:55.096
- And you knew to look for me
in the storage unit?

25:57.682 --> 25:59.601
- What book?

26:00.477 --> 26:04.606
- "The Game" by Ken Dryden.
It's a sports book.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.983
- The hockey goalie.

26:07.025 --> 26:09.194
- It's partly about hockey,

26:09.235 --> 26:11.446
more about the pathology

26:11.488 --> 26:14.574
of people
who play professional sports

26:14.616 --> 26:18.912
and how some of the people
we admire,

26:18.953 --> 26:21.873
sometimes even love,

26:21.915 --> 26:24.042
how they can be
pretty fucked up.

26:25.251 --> 26:29.297
We can all relate to that,
can't we?

26:29.339 --> 26:31.633
People in our lives we love

26:31.675 --> 26:34.636
that turn out to be...

26:34.678 --> 26:36.638
compromised.

26:36.680 --> 26:41.101
* *

26:41.142 --> 26:43.895
- It's very strange,

26:43.937 --> 26:46.231
you being in the storage unit

26:46.272 --> 26:48.358
in the middle of the night.

26:49.943 --> 26:53.196
- Well...

26:53.238 --> 26:57.659
maybe I was
also looking for Vincent.

26:57.701 --> 27:00.203
* *

27:00.245 --> 27:04.958
- I really do not like
where you and I are at.

27:05.000 --> 27:12.090
* *

27:16.553 --> 27:18.847
- Avi, I wanna ask you about--
- Oh, God.

27:18.888 --> 27:21.182
- It's not about God,
and it's not about religion.

27:21.224 --> 27:24.144
It's about Nora.

27:24.185 --> 27:25.478
- What about her?

27:25.520 --> 27:27.230
- Well, what she admitted,

27:27.272 --> 27:29.357
the connection she feels
with you.

27:29.399 --> 27:32.068
In my experience, connections
tend to be bilateral.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.320
So it's more likely than not
she felt something from you.

27:34.362 --> 27:36.531
And at the risk of getting
my head chopped off--

27:36.573 --> 27:39.242
even though beheading is not
in keeping with Judaism--

27:39.284 --> 27:42.037
I feel a connection
between you two.

27:42.078 --> 27:43.955
- You're wrong.
- Really?

27:43.997 --> 27:45.707
- Really.
- Well, have you ever had

27:45.749 --> 27:47.584
a girlfriend
or a significant other?

27:47.625 --> 27:49.294
- Janine, do you wanna work
with me or not?

27:49.336 --> 27:51.171
Because this conversation
is out of line.

27:51.212 --> 27:54.007
- Avi, we are behavioral
scientists at our core,

27:54.049 --> 27:55.216
and I'm just--
- My behavior is not

27:55.258 --> 27:56.760
the object of your focus.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.845
Do I make myself clear?

27:58.887 --> 28:00.388
- Let's go.

28:31.002 --> 28:33.296
[horn honking]

28:35.799 --> 28:38.718
- What is this? I'm under
some kind of surveillance now?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.762
- Why would you be
under surveillance?

28:40.804 --> 28:43.640
- Well, you showed up
at the park, now here.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.893
- Where's Zack?

28:46.935 --> 28:51.314
- He's upstairs, watching Luke
while I go to the market.

28:51.356 --> 28:53.775
- I was wondering
if we could talk further.

28:56.194 --> 28:57.445
- Here?

28:57.487 --> 28:59.656
- Actually,
maybe at the station.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.534
- The police station?

29:02.575 --> 29:05.245
- Would that be
too much trouble?

29:07.831 --> 29:10.291
- Do I need a lawyer?

29:10.333 --> 29:11.960
- I wasn't expecting
that question.

29:12.002 --> 29:14.170
- We just wanna talk.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.925
About Vincent.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.636
[soft energizing music]

29:21.678 --> 29:27.100
* *

29:27.142 --> 29:29.019
- She's in there?

29:29.060 --> 29:30.562
* *

29:30.603 --> 29:31.980
Why?

29:32.022 --> 29:33.523
- We'll give her some time,

29:33.565 --> 29:36.317
a chance to call her husband,
should she choose to do so.

29:36.359 --> 29:37.986
Roe is getting her some tea.

29:38.028 --> 29:39.946
- What's the plan here, Avi?

29:39.988 --> 29:41.906
- It'll come to me.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.950
* *

29:43.992 --> 29:45.410
- You suspect this woman?

29:45.452 --> 29:48.329
- It's more like
I don't unsuspect her.

29:48.371 --> 29:51.875
* *

29:51.916 --> 29:54.336
And there is something
she's not telling us.

29:56.046 --> 30:02.385
* *

30:12.729 --> 30:14.981
[knock at door]
[door opens]

30:15.023 --> 30:18.360
- Hey. Here you go.
A white tea.

30:18.401 --> 30:20.820
Which is a form of black tea.
Don't ask me.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.822
But it's low in caffeine, okay?
I know that.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.157
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

30:24.199 --> 30:26.993
- Hey, um, can you tell me
what this is about?

30:27.035 --> 30:28.828
- Oh, Avi will be right in.
Yeah, he's on a phone call.

30:28.870 --> 30:29.996
As soon as he wraps up,
he'll be right in.

30:30.038 --> 30:32.123
All right? Hang tight.

30:51.434 --> 30:52.727
[door opens]

31:15.667 --> 31:18.336
- I really don't understand
why I've been brought here.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.296
- I can see that
you're very nervous.

31:20.338 --> 31:22.048
I just wanna collect
some more information,

31:22.090 --> 31:24.134
maybe gain some more clarity

31:24.175 --> 31:28.013
on why people haven't been
totally forthcoming.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.725
Tell me about
your relationship with Vincent.

31:31.766 --> 31:33.560
- My relationship?

31:33.601 --> 31:35.478
- Mm-hmm.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.188
- As good as he closes,
he opens better.

31:37.230 --> 31:38.440
- Shh.
- Uh, he's my husband's pupil,

31:38.481 --> 31:39.607
or was.

31:39.649 --> 31:41.234
[pen scratching]

31:41.276 --> 31:42.861
Do you seriously need
to write that down?

31:42.902 --> 31:44.821
- Does that fully describe
the relationship,

31:44.863 --> 31:47.991
your husband's pupil?

31:48.033 --> 31:51.161
- He's also our neighbor

31:51.202 --> 31:53.580
and a boy who we're both
very fond of,

31:53.621 --> 31:55.206
which we told you.
- Yeah.

31:55.248 --> 31:58.418
I'd like to focus specifically
on your fondness for Vincent.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.421
[soft tense music]

32:01.463 --> 32:06.551
* *

32:06.593 --> 32:08.470
Do you recognize this person?

32:12.349 --> 32:14.851
- Yeah, I've--

32:14.893 --> 32:17.062
I mean,
I've seen him on the street.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.480
I think he's homeless.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.607
- You've never met him?

32:20.648 --> 32:22.359
- No.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.653
* *

32:25.695 --> 32:28.823
- Has Vincent ever met him?

32:28.865 --> 32:30.158
- Not that I'm aware.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.827
- You've never seen
this man, say,

32:32.869 --> 32:35.663
sitting on a park bench
with Vincent?

32:35.705 --> 32:37.248
- No.
- Would it be possible

32:37.290 --> 32:41.002
that this man saw you sitting
on a park bench with Vincent?

32:41.044 --> 32:44.881
* *

32:44.923 --> 32:46.341
Did you not hear my question?

32:46.383 --> 32:50.011
- Uh, I've encountered Vincent
in the park before.

32:50.053 --> 32:52.389
Sometimes we've sat
and chatted.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.848
I mean, we're neighbors.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.475
Is--what's so unusual
about that?

32:55.517 --> 32:57.227
- You texted him,

32:57.268 --> 32:59.813
"If you ever need to talk."

32:59.854 --> 33:02.148
* *

33:02.190 --> 33:04.150
You also texted him
on Sunday last,

33:04.192 --> 33:06.820
"That never should have
happened."

33:06.861 --> 33:10.323
It seems Vincent told his
friend Benjamin what happened.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.158
I would like for you to give me
your version

33:12.200 --> 33:13.451
as to what happened, Donya.
- I really don't

33:13.493 --> 33:15.245
understand what--
I don't know what's going on.

33:15.286 --> 33:19.082
- I would like for you to give
me your version, Donya.

33:19.124 --> 33:21.751
- Any idea where he's--
- None.

33:21.793 --> 33:23.378
- What did this Benjamin say?
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.839
I'd like for you to give me
your version.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.841
I already know the what.

33:27.882 --> 33:29.884
I wanna know the why.

33:35.557 --> 33:36.891
[pen clicks]

33:38.727 --> 33:41.021
Donya,

33:41.062 --> 33:43.732
I'm a firm believer

33:43.773 --> 33:45.984
that everybody,

33:46.026 --> 33:47.652
every single one of us,

33:47.694 --> 33:50.196
at some point in our life,

33:50.238 --> 33:53.867
has a "what do I do?" moment.

33:53.908 --> 34:01.041
What...do...I...do?

34:05.378 --> 34:08.965
This would be your moment,
Donya.

34:09.007 --> 34:16.139
* *

34:20.935 --> 34:23.229
- He--

34:23.271 --> 34:25.607
I--
[sighs]

34:28.068 --> 34:32.947
I could see that
he was so upset.

34:32.989 --> 34:36.576
- Vincent?
- Yeah, last Sunday.

34:36.618 --> 34:39.120
He had this upcoming date
with a girl

34:39.162 --> 34:40.663
who he thought liked him.

34:40.705 --> 34:44.292
And it turned out
to be a lark on her part.

34:44.334 --> 34:48.254
He was beyond devastated.

34:48.296 --> 34:50.090
- Where was Zack at this time?

34:50.131 --> 34:52.342
- Uh, he went to get takeout.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.844
- So it was just
you and Vincent?

34:54.886 --> 34:55.887
- Hey, can you look at me?

34:55.929 --> 34:57.097
Yes.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.474
Any girl would be lucky
to date you.

34:59.516 --> 35:02.102
Trust me.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.104
It was nothing,

35:04.145 --> 35:06.439
like how
a mother would kiss a son.

35:06.481 --> 35:09.776
Like, just--

35:09.818 --> 35:14.864
I could see
how devastated he was feeling.

35:14.906 --> 35:18.076
And I just meant
to bolster him some.

35:20.829 --> 35:23.540
And then I--

35:23.581 --> 35:28.920
* *

35:28.962 --> 35:30.213
Hey.

35:30.255 --> 35:33.174
[unsettling music]

35:33.216 --> 35:35.593
* *

35:35.635 --> 35:39.806
- This was not how
a mother kisses her son?

35:39.848 --> 35:44.519
* *

35:44.561 --> 35:46.521
- No.

35:48.523 --> 35:51.026
I was as surprised as he was.

35:51.067 --> 35:53.069
I never made a decision
to kiss him.

35:53.111 --> 35:54.487
It just happened.

35:54.529 --> 35:56.656
- You were sexually
drawn to Vincent?

35:56.698 --> 35:58.825
- No, not at all.

35:58.867 --> 36:01.161
I mean, I--

36:01.202 --> 36:03.621
I didn't think so.

36:03.663 --> 36:08.126
* *

36:08.168 --> 36:10.128
I can't explain it.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.672
- Try to explain it.

36:12.714 --> 36:15.550
* *

36:15.592 --> 36:17.510
- Um--

36:20.096 --> 36:23.016
I think,

36:23.058 --> 36:28.480
in the moment, I was so...

36:30.065 --> 36:35.153
Struck by his...tenderness...

36:35.195 --> 36:38.573
* *

36:38.615 --> 36:40.408
His vulnerability

36:40.450 --> 36:43.453
at a time I was getting
neither from Zack.

36:44.788 --> 36:49.042
I had been so fragile.

36:49.084 --> 36:52.879
And I saw this fragile boy.

36:52.921 --> 36:56.007
And I think it...

36:56.049 --> 36:58.718
maybe caused...

36:58.760 --> 37:04.432
this, like, intense feeling
of connection...

37:07.727 --> 37:10.939
That I confused...

37:10.980 --> 37:13.942
For desire.

37:13.983 --> 37:21.116
* *

37:23.785 --> 37:26.663
Also, uh--

37:28.415 --> 37:32.127
- Also what, Donya?

37:35.588 --> 37:37.382
- [sniffles]

37:41.803 --> 37:43.138
- Also what, Donya?

37:43.179 --> 37:45.181
- I might have
kissed him again.

37:45.223 --> 37:51.771
* *

37:51.813 --> 37:54.816
The first time was because
he was so lonely.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.946
The second time
was 'cause I was.

37:59.988 --> 38:07.037
* *

38:07.454 --> 38:08.955
[sighs heavily]

38:08.997 --> 38:14.127
* *

38:14.169 --> 38:15.837
- [softly] Oh, my God.

38:18.965 --> 38:23.386
- I would really appreciate

38:23.428 --> 38:25.513
none of this getting out.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.935
- Donya,

38:30.977 --> 38:34.647
because of what transpired
between you and Vincent,

38:34.689 --> 38:38.568
he could have
very well run away.

38:38.610 --> 38:43.114
I will have to bring this
to his parents' attention.

38:43.156 --> 38:48.828
* *

38:48.870 --> 38:51.247
- Oh, my God.

38:51.289 --> 38:57.629
* *

39:03.718 --> 39:05.720
- How'd you know that
Donya Miller sent those texts?

39:05.762 --> 39:07.389
- I didn't know.

39:07.430 --> 39:10.141
I had a feeling.

39:10.183 --> 39:13.937
Benjamin seemed certain
that Vincent had been kissed.

39:13.978 --> 39:16.564
Haley Townsend
said it wasn't by her.

39:16.606 --> 39:18.233
I had an uneasy feeling
from the beginning.

39:18.274 --> 39:21.403
I didn't know if it was about
Zack or Donya or both.

39:21.444 --> 39:23.905
- Okay.
So where does this get us?

39:23.947 --> 39:25.573
Are you one bit closer
to finding out

39:25.615 --> 39:28.451
what the hell happened here?
'Cause I'm not.

39:28.493 --> 39:31.079
- I am closer.
I'm almost there.

39:31.121 --> 39:32.956
- Well, hurry up.

39:32.997 --> 39:35.959
[dramatic music]

39:36.001 --> 39:42.966
* *

39:50.306 --> 39:51.433
- Did you arrest her?

39:51.474 --> 39:53.101
- Not yet.
- Why not?

39:53.143 --> 39:54.936
He's 16. It's sexual assault.

39:54.978 --> 39:57.647
- It may come to an arrest.
For now, we have leverage.

39:57.689 --> 40:00.150
There may be more information
to be gleaned from her.

40:00.191 --> 40:01.401
- I can't believe it.

40:01.443 --> 40:02.777
All this time,
I thought it was him.

40:02.819 --> 40:04.571
- Excuse me?
- Her husband, the tutor,

40:04.612 --> 40:05.739
he's always given me
the willies.

40:05.780 --> 40:09.075
But I thought
she was the normal one.

40:09.117 --> 40:10.493
I--I can't believe this.

40:10.535 --> 40:13.580
- As I said, there's still
information to be learned,

40:13.621 --> 40:16.583
including from Olivia.

40:16.624 --> 40:19.252
- But you already spoke to her.
- Briefly, not in depth.

40:19.294 --> 40:21.880
- She's not in a good place
to be interrogated.

40:21.921 --> 40:24.299
- You know,
she's blaming herself already.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.801
And you made her feel this.

40:26.843 --> 40:29.346
You just have a way
to make people feel guilty,

40:29.387 --> 40:30.972
even when they're not,
and I'm not gonna

40:31.014 --> 40:32.724
let you do that to her.
She doesn't deserve it.

40:32.766 --> 40:34.434
- Yeah, we need to protect her.

40:34.476 --> 40:35.810
- And believe me,
if she had anything

40:35.852 --> 40:37.979
to say of meaning,
we would know.

40:38.021 --> 40:40.190
* *

40:40.231 --> 40:42.192
- And you would tell me?

40:42.233 --> 40:44.319
* *

40:44.361 --> 40:46.363
[stairs creaking]

40:49.199 --> 40:56.373
* *

41:12.222 --> 41:13.181
- What's going on?

41:13.223 --> 41:20.146
* *

41:20.188 --> 41:21.898
What's going on?

41:21.940 --> 41:28.863
* *

41:40.125 --> 41:42.252
- It had more to do with,

41:42.293 --> 41:44.129
I think, with our estrangement

41:44.170 --> 41:49.342
than any attraction I had
for Vincent, which is none.

41:49.384 --> 41:51.469
I--I mean,
I have no attraction.

41:51.511 --> 41:52.971
It just happened.

41:57.183 --> 42:01.021
I wish I could explain it.

42:01.062 --> 42:02.856
It just happened.

42:04.941 --> 42:06.651
Can you please say something?

42:06.693 --> 42:08.903
- What do you expect me to say?

42:08.945 --> 42:11.197
"Honey, I French kissed
your student.

42:11.239 --> 42:13.074
We made out while you went
and got us takeout."

42:13.116 --> 42:14.826
You expect me to have
some kind of articulate,

42:14.868 --> 42:16.244
coherent response to that?

42:16.286 --> 42:19.497
- I expect you to have
at least a question.

42:19.539 --> 42:20.874
- Questions I have,

42:20.915 --> 42:23.460
like, why weren't you arrested?

42:23.501 --> 42:25.795
Why the fuck--
what the fuck is--

42:27.047 --> 42:29.632
Questions,
I have plenty, Donya.

42:29.674 --> 42:32.635
[unsettling music]

42:32.677 --> 42:35.889
* *

42:35.930 --> 42:40.935
- I never said I...
French kissed Vincent...

42:40.977 --> 42:43.146
* *

42:43.188 --> 42:45.231
Or that I made out with him.

42:45.273 --> 42:47.942
I said I kissed him.

42:47.984 --> 42:53.198
Did the detective tell you
I French kissed him?

42:53.239 --> 43:00.163
* *

43:11.007 --> 43:13.885
Vincent told you.

43:13.927 --> 43:16.012
You knew.

43:16.054 --> 43:18.014
* *

43:18.056 --> 43:20.517
You've known.

43:20.558 --> 43:24.813
Oh, my God.

43:24.854 --> 43:26.564
You have done something.

43:26.606 --> 43:28.650
- [chuckles softly]

43:31.111 --> 43:33.613
Well played, Donya.

43:33.655 --> 43:36.700
* *

43:36.741 --> 43:39.661
For you to accuse me,

43:39.703 --> 43:40.745
that would certainly preempt

43:40.787 --> 43:44.332
my suspicion of you,
wouldn't it?

43:44.374 --> 43:46.584
Very well played.

43:46.626 --> 43:53.758
* *

44:14.654 --> 44:17.490
- You know, the fact that she's
downstairs just a floor below,

44:17.532 --> 44:18.950
I am tempted to go down there.

44:18.992 --> 44:21.077
- And do what, Leonard?
What are you gonna do to her?

44:21.119 --> 44:23.038
- She knows more than she says.

44:23.079 --> 44:24.998
If they were close,
if they were intimate.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.791
I knew something depraved
was going on.

44:26.833 --> 44:28.710
I just assumed it was him.

44:28.752 --> 44:30.545
- You're a hypocrite.

44:30.587 --> 44:32.756
What are you, if not depraved?

44:32.797 --> 44:36.259
We stand here like this
in all our grief and fear

44:36.301 --> 44:38.720
and a fucking whore
with our son gone,

44:38.762 --> 44:40.764
at least in part
because you're vile!

44:43.892 --> 44:45.935
- Okay, well,
why not arrest her?

44:45.977 --> 44:47.270
If she has more to tell,

44:47.312 --> 44:48.938
there's no better way
to squeeze her.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.774
And the boy is underage.

44:50.815 --> 44:55.278
So at a minimum, we can search
incident to arrest, right?

44:55.320 --> 44:56.529
- Not the whole building,

44:56.571 --> 44:58.073
only the area
within her control.

44:58.114 --> 45:00.408
- Well, what about
if we can show the magistrate

45:00.450 --> 45:02.410
that Vincent never
left the building?

45:02.452 --> 45:05.497
- We can't because we can't
rule out the back entrance.

45:05.538 --> 45:06.831
- What are you doing, Avi?

45:06.873 --> 45:08.958
Are--are you drawing
your little fish again?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.419
- Please, Janine,
I'm trying to concentrate.

45:11.461 --> 45:14.297
- Uh, yeah, so am I.

45:14.339 --> 45:15.632
- Certainly, there must be

45:15.674 --> 45:18.051
an episode of "Law & Order"
you can watch, huh?

45:20.845 --> 45:23.598
- You know what?

45:23.640 --> 45:24.557
[call ends]

45:24.599 --> 45:26.393
[paper crumples]

45:28.144 --> 45:29.145
- I do know what.

45:29.187 --> 45:31.231
I know I hurt your feelings
is what.

45:46.663 --> 45:49.582
[soft resonant music]

45:49.624 --> 45:56.756
* *

46:27.412 --> 46:34.377
* *

46:49.601 --> 46:52.562
[dramatic music]

46:52.604 --> 46:59.736
* *
