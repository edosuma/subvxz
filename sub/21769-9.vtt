WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.870
OH, MY GOD. MMM!

00:02.936 --> 00:05.272
THIS VODKA-INFUSED
LEMON SQUARE IS LIKE
A PARTY IN MY MOUTH

00:05.339 --> 00:08.342
THAT THE COPS ARE
TRYING TO RAID.

00:08.408 --> 00:11.945
- YOU GOTTA TRY IT, JO, HERE.
- NO, I'M OKAY WITH
MY VIRGIN BROWNIE,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.014
WHO'S SAVING ITSELF
TILL MARRIAGE.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.552
OH, MY GOD.
THAT GUY OVER THERE
LOOKS LIKE TRENT PIERCE.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.487
THAT BIG
CASTING DIRECTOR GUY?

00:20.554 --> 00:21.855
YEAH, THE ONE
I AUDITIONED FOR.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.625
AS MY PEOPLE SAY,
TIME TO SCHMOOZE.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.297
- HI, TRENT.Â 
- HELLO.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.366
I'D LIKE TWO SCOTCH SCONES
AND A RUM CUPCAKE.

00:32.432 --> 00:35.369
NO, I'M NOT A WAITRESS.
I'M AN ACTRESS.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.638
OH, BOY.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.774
HERE'S MY BUSINESS CARD.
SEND ME A HEADSHOT.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.310
DON'T CALL US.
WE'LL CALL YOU.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.279
ACTUALLY, YOU ALREADY
HAVE MY HEADSHOT.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.314
I ALREADY AUDITIONED
FOR YOU.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.349
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME?

00:49.416 --> 00:52.152
- I GOT NOTHING.
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.755
LOOK, I'M SURE
WHATEVER HAPPENED

00:54.821 --> 00:56.490
WAS LIFE-CHANGING
FOR YOU,

00:56.557 --> 01:00.561
BUT I SEE 4,000 ACTORS
A WEEK, SO IF YOU'RE NOT
ON A STAGE OR SCREEN,

01:00.627 --> 01:02.429
THERE'S NO REASON
TO REMEMBER YOU.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.431
I WAS ON SCREEN.
I DID A MATTRESS
COMMERCIAL,

01:04.498 --> 01:06.667
AND I ALSO DID AN EPISODE
OF "DUE PROCESS."

01:06.733 --> 01:08.268
REALLY?
WHO'D YOU PLAY?

01:08.335 --> 01:10.003
DEAD WOMAN'S FOOT.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.005
YEAH, I GOT
A GREAT REVIEW

01:12.072 --> 01:15.042
ON A VERY WEIRD
WEBSITE.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.611
I'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN
THE FIRST HALF OF THIS
CONVERSATION.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.514
CAN YOU OR CAN YOU
NOT TAKE MY ORDER?

01:20.581 --> 01:24.418
LISTEN, HERE, IT IS
VERY DIFFICULT OUT
THERE, ALL RIGHT?

01:24.484 --> 01:26.820
AND YOU CAN'T GET A JOB
UNLESS SOMEONE GIVES
YOU A BREAK,

01:26.887 --> 01:28.922
AND YOU CAN'T GET A BREAK
UNLESS SOMEONE GIVES
YOU A JOB.

01:28.989 --> 01:32.092
( GIBBERISH )

01:32.159 --> 01:34.428
LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T
GET WORK, MAKE WORK.

01:34.494 --> 01:38.232
SET UP A SHOWCASE.
DO AN OPEN MIC NIGHT.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.267
ALL THESE ARE
EXCELLENT SUGGESTIONS.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.070
OKAY, SO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS
I SHOULD DO, LIKE,

01:43.136 --> 01:44.605
A ONE-WOMAN SHOW.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.474
OR MAYBE YOU COULD DO
A GROUP SHOWCASE SO
YOU COULD DILUTE THIS

01:47.541 --> 01:49.076
WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.447
OKAY, SO THE BROWNIE LIED
ABOUT BEING A VIRGIN.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.482

AN INCREDIBLE MEMORY.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.130
NO, HE DOES NOT.
HOW CAN HE REMEMBER
HER AND NOT ME?

02:10.197 --> 02:12.266
HOW COULD ANYONE FORGET
THAT CRAZY HAIR?

02:12.332 --> 02:16.270
HOW CAN ANYONE FORGET ME
STRADDLING THEM AND FORCING
FRIED CHICKEN

02:16.336 --> 02:18.605
AND GRAVY AND BISCUITS
INTO THEIR MOUTH?

02:18.672 --> 02:20.007

TWICE THIS WEEK.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.676
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

02:36.623 --> 02:38.759
AND YOU CAN RENT IT
BY THE NIGHT.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.028
IT ALSO HAS A MIRROR
A DRAIN ON THE FLOOR.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.430
NOT FEELING GOOD
ABOUT THAT ONE.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.767
THOSE FINANCIAL EXPERTS

03:11.592 --> 03:13.360
WHAT'S WRONG

WHY DO I NEED A WATCH?

APPARENTLY, WE CAN GET
A FREE BRAZILIAN BLAST,

03:32.346 --> 03:34.248
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE
EITHER A FRUITY DRINK

03:34.314 --> 03:35.849
OR A ROCKET SHIP.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.485
I'M HAPPY WITH
EITHER ONE, SO...

03:38.552 --> 03:41.989

03:54.134 --> 03:57.671

NOT DEALING WITH IT

03:57.738 --> 03:59.506
IS TIME I SPEND
ON MORE IMPORTANT THINGS,

03:59.573 --> 04:03.443
LIKE THESE EQUATIONS
THE PHYSICS BOWL.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.445

BE KNOWN FOR THIS.

I WANNA BE KNOWN
FOR THESE.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.037

04:34.508 --> 04:36.176
I DON'T WANT
YOU TO TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.645
I JUST CAME DOWN HERE
BECAUSE I WAS OUT
OF SHERRY.

04:38.712 --> 04:42.249
I WASN'T LOOKING TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE TRAVELING
PANTS PROBLEMS.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.751

04:44.818 --> 04:48.422
OH, ALL RIGHT.
TELL AUNTIE.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.891
SO MY FRIENDS AND I
ARE PUTTING TOGETHER
THIS SHOWCASE

04:50.958 --> 04:53.193
TO IMPRESS THIS REALLY,
REALLY BIG CASTING DIRECTOR,

04:53.260 --> 04:56.129
AND SO I'M GONNA BE SINGING
ARETHA FRANKLIN'S "RESPECT."

04:56.196 --> 04:57.865
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING.
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT THAT.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.402
I WAS LOOKING FOR THEATERS,
BUT EVERYTHING IS
SO EXPENSIVE.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.138
THE CHEAPEST ONE
I FOUND WAS $2,500.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.441
WELL, GEORGIA, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET UP OFF THIS COUCH

05:07.508 --> 05:09.142
AND START LOOKING.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.345
I DID. ALL OVER TOWN.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.548
I MEAN LIFT UP
THE CUSHIONS.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.619
THERE'S USUALLY TWICE
THAT AMOUNT JUST LYING
AROUND IN HERE.

OH, I'M EXHAUSTED.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.225
I'LL JUST WRITE YOU
A CHECK.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.895
NO, AUNT HONEY,
I CAN'T KEEP GETTING
FAVORS FROM YOU.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.396
I HAVE TO DO THIS
ON MY OWN.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.099
NO, YOU'LL BE
DOING ME A FAVOR.
I NEED A TAX WRITE-OFF.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.568
IF I INVEST IN YOUR
LITTLE SHOWCASE,

05:34.635 --> 05:38.105
IT CAN BE MY "SPIDER-MAN":
THE MUSICAL.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.973
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.209
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

YOU'RE WELCOME,
WELCOME, WELCOME.

05:44.745 --> 05:48.549
AUNT HONEY, DO YOU
OWN A JET SKI?

05:48.615 --> 05:52.586

I THREW IT OUT WHEN
I COULDN'T FIND THE KEY.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.223
<i>( AUNT HONEY GASPS )</i>

05:56.290 --> 05:58.425

YOU PERFECT-HAIRED
STRANGER?

06:01.094 --> 06:03.430
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.866
NO, NO, NO,
DON'T MESS UP THE DO.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.669
NO, IT TOOK EIGHT HOURS,
FOUR GAY MEN, TWO ASSISTANTS

06:08.735 --> 06:11.271
AND THEY STILL HAD
TO SEDATE ME.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.675
THAT'S HOW I DO
ALL MY HAIR APPOINTMENTS.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.544
OKAY, CHECK IT OUT.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.446
I CAN DO THIS.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.349
- ( GASPS )
- I KNOW.
AND THEN I CAN DO THIS.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.851
AND THEN I CAN DO THIS.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.854
SHAKE IT, SHAKE IT.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.756
IT MAKES ME DIZZY,
BUT I COULD DO THAT.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.259
WELL, JO,
YOU DO LOOK FABULOUS.

06:32.326 --> 06:35.629
I MAY EVEN STOP TELLING
MY FRIENDS YOU'RE BLIND.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.978
HERE WE ARE!

06:51.044 --> 06:52.613
I KNOW IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE MUCH.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.883
I JUST FEEL LIKE A LOT
OF MAGIC HAS BEEN
MADE HERE.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.985
AND A LOT OF DRUGS.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.355
( VOCALIZES )

07:01.421 --> 07:03.957
I DON'T THINK THE ACOUSTICS
ARE VERY GOOD IN HERE.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.159
BROOKE, I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T SINGING
IN THE SHOW.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.830
HOW ELSE WILL I SHOW EVERYONE
THAT I'M A TRIPLE THREAT?

07:09.897 --> 07:13.033
YOU PICK THREE THINGS
YOU'RE GOOD AT.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.038
I THINK MY NAKED
MONOLOGUE IS GOING
TO BE AWESOME IN HERE.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.507
OH!
WHAT PLAY IS IT FROM?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.609
IT HAS TO BE FROM A PLAY?

07:22.676 --> 07:25.479
AW, MAN, I WAS
JUST GOING TO TAKE
MY CLOTHES OFF AND TALK.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.148
YOO-HOO.
SORRY I'M LATE.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.718
WHO KNEW BROOKLYN WAS
NOT IN MANHATTAN?

07:31.785 --> 07:35.289
EVERYONE, I WOULD LIKE
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR
INVESTOR, MY AUNT HONEY.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.127
THIS IS JUST...

07:40.194 --> 07:42.129
THE MOST, UM...

07:42.196 --> 07:44.464
WELL, IF YOU KIDS
LIKE IT.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.467
WE KNOW IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH,
BUT DON'T WORRY. WE'LL HAVE
IT PICKED UP IN NO TIME.

07:47.534 --> 07:51.338
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.
I'M JUST A SILENT PARTNER.

07:51.405 --> 07:52.906
I'M JUST HERE TO MAKE

07:52.973 --> 07:56.944
ALL OF YOU FABULOUS
PEOPLE'S DREAMS
COME TRUE.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.950
- DO YOU WANNA
TAKE A SEAT?
- NO, LORD, NO.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.020
OKAY, SO WE ONLY HAVE
AN HOUR FOR REHEARSAL.
LET'S GET STARTED.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.655
THERE WAS AN APPLE TREE
BY MY HOUSE.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.925
- KEVIN, KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON!
- ARE YOU SURE?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.761
LET THE YOUNG MAN
EXPRESS HIMSELF.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.698
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN UP, PEOPLE.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.633
WE'RE GONNA GO OVER THE LIST
FOR THE SHOW.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.768
FIRST, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE SOME DANCERS.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.504
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO
INTO A FEW MUSICAL NUMBERS.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.173
I'M GONNA BE SINGING
ARETHA FRANKLIN'S "RESPECT."

08:26.240 --> 08:28.709
SO WE'RE DEFINITELY
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT
ABOUT 10 TO 15 MINUTES

08:28.775 --> 08:31.712
SO THAT APPLAUSE
CAN JUST LIKE DIE DOWN.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.515
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE
WITH THE MONOLOGUES.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.251
MATERIAL WON'T MATTER
IF NO ONE CAN SEE YOU.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.219
IS THAT ALL THE LIGHT?

08:39.286 --> 08:43.190
OH, GOOD.
OH, SORRY.

08:43.257 --> 08:46.026
SILENT PARTNER, I'LL JUST
STAND OVER IN THIS CORNER,

08:46.093 --> 08:49.096
THIS DARK DARK CORNER.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.233
YOU'RE WELCOME TO BORROW
MY LIGHTING GUY.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.434
YOU HAVE A LIGHTING GUY?

08:54.501 --> 08:56.470
I ALWAYS KEEP ONE
ON RETAINER.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.473
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU
MAY NEED TO GET LIT.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.976
OH! THANK YOU, TREVOR.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.617
AUNT HONEY IS OUT
OF CONTROL.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.320
DO YOU KNOW THAT YESTERDAY
SHE BROUGHT IN HER OWN
STUNT GUY?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.989
- SHE HAS A STUNT GUY?
- YEAH, SHE SAYS THAT
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU NEED

09:16.056 --> 09:17.958
TO FAKE YOUR OWN DEATH.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.327
DO YOU THINK I'D LOOK
GOOD WITH HIGHLIGHTS?

09:20.394 --> 09:24.298
AND IF SO,
WHAT ARE HIGHLIGHTS?

09:24.364 --> 09:26.433
JO, FOCUS, ALL RIGHT?

09:26.500 --> 09:30.270
I HAVE A SITUATION.
SHE'S EVEN HIJACKED
THE PROGRAMS.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.806
WHY IS YOUR SHOWCASE CALLED
"A BIT O' HONEY"?

09:32.873 --> 09:34.541
EXACTLY.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.543
LIKE, I HAVE A SILENT
PARTNER WHO JUST WANTS

09:36.610 --> 09:38.679
TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.347
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
LADIES.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.683
I SAW YOU FROM OVER THERE.
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
MY PHONE NUMBER.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.852
THAT'S CUTE, SWEETIE.
I'M BUSY. SORRY.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.320
IT'S FOR HER.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.364
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I WANNA SUCK
THAT UP WITH A BISCUIT.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.968
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.870
I THINK IT'S THE HAIR.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.972
THE CHEMICALS MUST HAVE
SEEPED INTO MY BRAIN.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.774
AND I LIKE IT.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.444
TRENT IS OVER THERE.
I GOTTA GO.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.515
HI, TRENT. I'D LIKE
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.818
DON'T NEED A MENU.
I'LL HAVE TWO SCOTCH
SCONES AND A RUM CUPCAKE.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.486
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
IT'S GEORGIA.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.154
I SAW YOU HERE LAST WEEK.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.657
I RE-REINTRODUCED MYSELF.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.226
I GOT NOTHING.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.128
WE HAD A WHOLE
CONVERSATION.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.498
I'M KIDDING.
ACTORS-- SO SENSITIVE.

10:31.565 --> 10:34.768
WELL, PER YOUR SUGGESTION,

10:34.835 --> 10:37.471
I HAVE A SHOWCASE,
AND I WOULD LIKE
FOR YOU TO ATTEND.

10:37.538 --> 10:40.474
SO YOU TOOK MY ADVICE.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.309
THAT'S ANNOYING.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.811
I'M GONNA BE ANNOYING
IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP
TO THAT THING.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.148
TRUST ME, SHE CAN
BE PRETTY ANNOYING.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.184
HEY, TRENT PIERCE.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.653
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE
IN A SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL?

10:52.719 --> 10:56.089
I GOT TWO NUMBERS
TODAY. WHAT?

11:00.527 --> 11:04.464
98, 99...

11:04.531 --> 11:06.533
100.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.638
1, 2...

11:11.705 --> 11:14.208
-<i>( DOORBELL RINGS )</i>
- COME IN.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.482
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR JO PYE.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.251
I'M RIGHT HERE.

11:24.318 --> 11:26.987
- ( GASPING )
- WOW! WOW!

11:27.054 --> 11:28.488
YOU LOOK GREAT.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.424
NOT THAT YOU
DON'T NORMALLY.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.926
BUT YOU DON'T.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.963
I JUST GOT
MY HAIR STRAIGHTENED.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.865
THAT'S WHY WE HAD
TO STUDY UP HERE,

11:37.931 --> 11:39.967
'CAUSE I COULDN'T RISK GOING OUT
IN ALL THAT HUMIDITY.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.802
AND THAT'S ALSO WHY
I DIDN'T GET IN

11:41.869 --> 11:44.137
TO DO MY LAB WORK TODAY.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.173
I DID IT.
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COPY OFF OF MINE?

11:46.240 --> 11:49.176
- I CAN DO THE COPYING FOR YOU.
- I CAN MAKE YOU AN OMELET.

11:49.243 --> 11:50.978
SURE.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.946
I MEAN IF IT'S NO PROBLEM.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.948
OKAY, YOU GUYS,
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO BE MY AUDIENCE.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.651
I HAVE A VERY BIG SONG
THAT I HAVE TO SING
TONIGHT IN THE SHOW.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.920
AND I NEED TO SEE WHERE ALL
THE CHEERING'S GONNA BE.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.724
IF NEITHER OF YOU IS HERE,
I HAVE HAD THIS DREAM BEFORE.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.827
I'M NOT IN YOUR DREAMS?

12:08.195 --> 12:10.063
YOU'RE IN MINE.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.133
- JO.
- GIVE IT UP FOR
GEORGIA CHAMBERLAIN.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.635
( CLEARS THROAT )

12:14.701 --> 12:18.138
âª WHAT YOU WANT,
BABY, I'VE GOT IT âª

12:18.205 --> 12:21.175
âª WHAT YOU NEED,
YOU KNOW I GOT IT âª

12:22.509 --> 12:24.978
WHAT?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.314
YOU SOUND DELIGHTFUL.

12:27.381 --> 12:29.049
THANK YOU.
LET ME FINISH.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.817
IT'S ALMOST THERE.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.521
IT JUST SOUNDED LIKE
YOU WERE BRINGING IT
MORE FROM UP HERE

12:34.588 --> 12:37.057
THAN FROM DOWN HERE.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.525
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
AUNT HONEY,

12:38.592 --> 12:40.460
I THINK I KNOW WHERE
TO BRING IT FROM.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.263
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I CAN SHOW YOU
BETTER THAN I CAN TELL YOU.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.831
( CLEARS THROAT )

12:47.134 --> 12:49.069
âª I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU âª

12:49.136 --> 12:51.238
âª ALL MY MONEY âª

12:51.305 --> 12:53.473
âª AND ALL I WANT âª

12:53.540 --> 12:55.976
âª IN RETURN, HONEY âª

12:56.043 --> 12:59.847
âª IS TO GIVE ME MY PRIDE âª

13:01.048 --> 13:03.317
PAUSE.
âª WHEN YOU GET HOME âª

13:03.383 --> 13:06.119
( CHEERING )

13:06.186 --> 13:08.088
IT'S SUBTLE,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.891
BUT CAN YOU HEAR
THE DIFFERENCE?

13:10.958 --> 13:13.427
âª YOUR KISSES âª

13:13.493 --> 13:15.329
âª SWEETER THAN HONEY âª

13:15.395 --> 13:17.064
âª GUESS WHAT? âª

13:17.130 --> 13:20.200
âª SO IS MY MONEY âª

13:21.468 --> 13:24.972
âª AND ALL I WANT YOU
TO DO FOR ME âª

13:25.038 --> 13:28.475
âª IS TO GIVE IT TO ME
WHEN YOU GET HOME âª

13:28.542 --> 13:31.111
âª R-E-S-P-E-C-T âª

13:31.178 --> 13:33.814
âª FIND OUT WHAT
IT MEANS TO ME âª

13:33.881 --> 13:36.683
âª R-E-S-P-E-C-T âª

13:36.750 --> 13:39.486
âª TAKE CARE, TCB âª

13:39.553 --> 13:41.822
âª SOCK IT TO ME,
SOCK IT TO ME... âª

13:41.889 --> 13:44.858
âª RESPECT,
YOU KNOW I WANT IT âª

13:44.925 --> 13:47.227
<i>âª LITTLE RESPECT âª</i>

13:47.294 --> 13:50.297
âª COME ON, GIMME SOME-- âª

13:50.364 --> 13:51.465
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:51.532 --> 13:54.468
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE THE SONG BETTER.

13:54.535 --> 13:57.171
THE SONG WAS FINE.
THE SHOW WAS FINE.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.106
ALL WE NEEDED WAS THE MONEY
TO GET THE THEATER,

13:59.173 --> 14:01.542
BUT YOU JUST HAD
TO COME IN
AND TAKE OVER.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.210
YOU TOOK OVER.

14:03.277 --> 14:07.014
THE LIGHTS NEEDED
TO BE BRIGHTER.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.250
THE MONOLOGUES NEEDED
TO BE SHORTER AND KEVIN
NEEDED TO BE NAKEDER.

14:10.317 --> 14:14.254
WELL, KEVIN CAN'T ACT.
HE SHOULD BE NAKEDER.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.889
YOU ARE REALLY MESSING
WITH MY HEAD

14:15.956 --> 14:17.891
AND NOW YOU GOT ME THINKING
THAT I CAN'T SING.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.259
NOW THAT'S SILLY.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.628
THAT'S SILLY,
BUT THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.632
WELL, MAYBE WE
SHOULD JUST

14:25.699 --> 14:28.001
TAKE IT FROM THE TOP.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.604
- NO.
- NO?

14:30.671 --> 14:32.806
WE'RE NOT
TAKING IT ANYWHERE.

14:32.873 --> 14:36.610
MAYBE I CAN SHOW YOU
RATHER THAN TELL YOU.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.254
âª SOCK IT TO ME,
SOCK IT TO ME âª

14:47.321 --> 14:49.156
âª SOCK IT TO ME,
SOCK IT TO ME, SOCK IT-- âª

14:49.223 --> 14:51.158
OH, ZIP IT, YOU PIPS!

15:03.871 --> 15:05.973
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE
YOU OUT IN THAT.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.708
SHH.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.946
YOU'RE GONNA MISS YOUR
BEST FRIEND'S SHOW
FOR YOUR HAIR?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.748
MY FRIENDSHIP WILL LAST.

15:14.815 --> 15:17.251
THIS HAIR WON'T.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.654
IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.
I MEAN THIS MORNING

15:20.721 --> 15:22.322
WHEN I WENT TO GO PAY
FOR MY COFFEE,

15:22.389 --> 15:24.558
THEY JUST GAVE IT TO ME
FOR FREE, AND YOU KNOWÂ 
WHAT THEY SAID,

15:24.625 --> 15:27.261
"NICE HAIR."
AND THEN,

15:27.327 --> 15:29.396
WHEN I GOT TO THE SUBWAY
JUST AS IT WAS PULLING OUT,

15:29.463 --> 15:30.931
IT STOPPED, BACKED UP

15:30.998 --> 15:33.100
AND LET ME ON.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.236
WHO KNEW THAT THEY COULD
GO BACKWARDS LIKE THAT?

15:36.303 --> 15:37.771
NOT ME.

15:37.838 --> 15:41.175
I HAVEN'T TAKEN THE SUBWAY
SINCE THE SUMMER OF SAM.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.813
I DATED SAMUEL L. JACKSON.

15:48.549 --> 15:52.219
BUT STILL, SOMEONE
SHOULD BE DOWN AT THAT
THEATER TO SUPPORT HER.

15:52.286 --> 15:54.488
YOU MEAN LIKE HER AUNT

15:54.555 --> 15:56.490
AND PRIMARY INVESTOR.

15:56.557 --> 15:59.426
YOU HEARD HER.
SHE DOESN'T WANT
ME DOWN THERE.

15:59.493 --> 16:00.928
APPARENTLY,

16:00.994 --> 16:04.264
I JUST
TAKE OVER EVERYTHING.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.800
I DO NOT TAKE
OVER EVERYTHING.

16:06.867 --> 16:10.470
I MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER
BY TAKING IT-- OH, GOD,
I TOOK IT OVER.

16:11.572 --> 16:13.607
YOU TEND TO DO THAT.

16:13.674 --> 16:16.877
GEORGIA SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

16:16.944 --> 16:20.881
IF YOU BRING ME IN,
YOU'RE GONNA GET AN
AUNT HONEY PRODUCTION.

16:20.948 --> 16:24.551
OKAY, WELL, MOST OF YOUR LIFE
IS AN AUNT HONEY PRODUCTION.

16:24.618 --> 16:28.255
I THINK THAT SHE JUST
WANTED THIS ONE
TO BE HERS.

16:28.322 --> 16:29.756
THEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.859
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

16:31.925 --> 16:34.461
THE GIRL SUNG THE HELL
OUT OF THAT SONG,

16:34.528 --> 16:37.397
AND I MADE HER
DOUBT HERSELF.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.434
SHE'D PROBABLY LIKE
TO HEAR THAT FROM YOU.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.436
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.172
I'LL GO DOWN TO THAT
THEATER AND TELL HER WHAT
A WONDERFUL SINGER SHE IS.

16:45.239 --> 16:48.175
ALSO, I HAVE SOME IDEAS
ABOUT HOW SHE COULD WEAR
HER HAIR.

16:48.242 --> 16:51.645
AND I COULD GET
MY MAKEUP GUY TO JUST--

16:51.712 --> 16:53.714
OH, GOD,
I'M DOING IT AGAIN.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.719
I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF.

17:00.721 --> 17:03.190
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE DRINKING WATER.

17:03.257 --> 17:05.893
YES, IT'S CALLED
BOTTOMING OUT.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.338
( VOCALIZING OFF-KEY )

17:20.741 --> 17:22.442
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS HORRIBLE.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.846
NO, NO, WE SOUNDED GREAT.
TRUST ME. I HAVE
PERFECT PITCH.

17:25.913 --> 17:29.716
TRIPLE THREAT.
SINGER, DANCER, TAP DANCER.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.685
NO, THAT'S ONLY
LIKE TWO THREATS.

17:31.752 --> 17:34.254
FORGET HER.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

17:34.321 --> 17:35.722
AM I SINGING FROM HERE?
AM I SINGING FROM HERE?

17:35.789 --> 17:37.224
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I CAN SING ANYMORE.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.260
- GEORGIA, AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT FIRST?
- ( GASPS )

17:40.327 --> 17:42.262
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:42.329 --> 17:44.598
WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.
WHAT? WHAT?

17:44.665 --> 17:46.266
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.102
I'M KIND OF REGRETTING
INVITING MY GRANDPARENTS.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.438
OKAY, WELL, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.440
I GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS
RIGHT NOW.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.709
- ARE YOU NERVOUS?
- NO, NO, NOT AS--

17:55.776 --> 17:58.011
AS NERVOUS AS
YOU SEEM TO BE.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.448
GEORGIA--
WOW, YOUR FRIENDS ARE
SO DIFFERENT THAN MINE.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.950
HELLO.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.752
- JO, YOU'RE HERE.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.688
FRIENDSHIP IS MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT THAN PERFECT HAIR.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.556
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S THE SHOW GOING?

18:09.623 --> 18:12.593
THERE'S AN ELDERLY COUPLE
OUTSIDE THAT LOOK VERY
DISAPPOINTED.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.629
NAN-NAN AND POP-POP.

18:15.696 --> 18:18.498
JO, I DON'T THINK
I CAN GO ONSTAGE.
I CAN'T SING.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.268
YES, YOU CAN.
I BELIEVE IN YOU

18:21.335 --> 18:24.671
MORE THAN I BELIEVE
IN THE INCREDIBLE LIFE
I WAS HAVING WITH STRAIGHT HAIR.

18:24.738 --> 18:26.807
OKAY, MAYBE I'M NOT
TOTALLY OVER IT,

18:26.874 --> 18:30.177
BUT YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
BELIEVES IN YOU?
AUNT HONEY.

18:30.244 --> 18:31.778
BUT SHE SAID THAT--

18:31.845 --> 18:33.614
I KNOW WHAT SHE SAID,
BUT I'M GONNA TELL
YOU WHAT SHE MEANT.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.249
AND IF THAT DOESN'T GET
YOU OUT ON THE STAGE SINGING,

18:35.315 --> 18:37.885
THEN SOME REALLY GOOD
HAIR DIED FOR NOTHING.

18:40.254 --> 18:41.822
HI, EVERYBODY.

18:41.889 --> 18:45.092
I'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO SINGING FOR YOU ALL,

18:45.158 --> 18:46.927
BUT NOW THAT I'M HERE,

18:46.994 --> 18:49.096
IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT

18:49.162 --> 18:53.000
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEONE
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE
HERE THAT ISN'T.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.102
SHE'S A WOMAN WHO HELPED
PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER,

18:55.169 --> 18:58.338
AND SHE'S ALWAYS BELIEVED
IN MY DREAMS

18:58.405 --> 19:02.009
AND SOMEONE I KNOW
WHO JUST WANTED THE BEST FOR ME.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.278
AUNT HONEY:
<i>THEN GET ON WITH IT.</i>

19:06.580 --> 19:09.850
- AUNT HONEY.
- PEOPLE WANNA HEAR YOU SING,

19:09.917 --> 19:12.052
NOT GIVE A MONOLOGUE.

19:12.119 --> 19:14.188
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAME.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.723
I WOULDN'T MISS THIS
FOR THE WORLD.

19:16.790 --> 19:20.727
THAT'S WHY I STAYED OUT
OF THE WAY. I SAT
IN THE BACK.

19:20.794 --> 19:23.931
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU PEOPLE DO IT.
MOVE OVER, HONEY, MOVE.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.899
COME ON, COME,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

19:25.966 --> 19:28.101
NORMALLY, I'D BE
IN THE FRONT.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.304
BUT THIS IS YOUR NIGHT.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.105
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.441
WELL, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
MAKING APOLOGIES.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.677
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNEW THAT.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.879
I KNOW,
AND I'M SORRY, TOO.

19:38.946 --> 19:42.316
WELL, WHAT NOW?
WE GONNA HUG
OR ARE YOU GONNA SING?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.485
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A HUG
A LITTLE BIT LATER.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.921
- BUT YES, I'D LIKE TO SING.
- WELL, THEN HIT IT.

19:47.988 --> 19:49.923
THREE, FOUR...

19:49.990 --> 19:53.594
âª WHAT YOU WANT,
BABY, I'VE GOT IT âª

19:53.660 --> 19:55.629
âª HEY, WHAT YOU NEED âª

19:55.696 --> 19:57.631
âª YOU KNOW I'VE GOT IT âª

19:57.698 --> 20:00.734
âª HEY, ALL I'M ASKING âª

20:00.801 --> 20:03.237
âª IS FOR A LITTLE RESPECT
WHEN YOU COME HOME âª

20:03.303 --> 20:04.805
âª HEY, BABY. âª

20:13.747 --> 20:15.449
GEORGIA CHAMBERLAIN?

20:15.516 --> 20:18.852
HI, I'D LIKE
TWO SCOTCH SCONES
AND A RUM CUPCAKE.

20:18.919 --> 20:21.588
YOU GOT ME BACK.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.257
NICE TO KNOW THAT
YOU REMEMBER ME AGAIN.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.459
I DO, AND AFTER WATCHING
YOU PERFORM LAST NIGHT,

20:25.526 --> 20:28.428
I PROMISE I WILL NEVER
FORGET YOU.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.999
THANK YOU.
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
FORGET KEVIN, EITHER, RIGHT?

20:32.065 --> 20:33.433
WHO?

20:33.500 --> 20:36.670
THE NAKED GUY
WHO DID THE MONOLOGUE
FROM "OUR TOWN"

20:36.737 --> 20:39.973
AND HIS NANA CAME UP
ON STAGE AND GAVE HIM
A BLANKET.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.644
YOU'D THINK I'D
REMEMBER THAT, AND YET...

20:43.710 --> 20:45.679
YOU LEAD A VERY
INTERESTING LIFE, DON'T YOU?

20:45.746 --> 20:48.382
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.917
- I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
- OKAY.

20:49.983 --> 20:53.020
- HEY, GEORGIA.
- HEY, JO.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.756
CAN WE NOT MOVE
AROUND A LOT TODAY?

20:55.822 --> 20:57.157
WHAT'S GOING ON,
SWEETHEART?

20:57.224 --> 21:00.227
I WENT TO GET MY HAIR
STRAIGHTENED AGAIN.

21:00.294 --> 21:02.329
YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT.

21:02.396 --> 21:05.499
I WAS, BUT THEN
THE DOG BARKED AT ME

21:05.566 --> 21:07.601
AND THEN I HAD TO PAY
FOR MY OWN COFFEE,

21:07.668 --> 21:11.438
AND THE SUBWAY JUST
CLOSED IN MY FACE.

21:11.505 --> 21:14.174
WHY DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE
ANYTHING HAPPENED TO IT?

21:14.241 --> 21:16.443
APPARENTLY, WHEN YOU
WALK INTO A SALON,

21:16.510 --> 21:19.780
AND YOU SAY THAT
YOU WANT A BRAZILIAN,

21:19.847 --> 21:23.217
YOU HAVE TO BE
VERY VERY VERY SPECIFIC.

21:25.252 --> 21:27.654
OH!

21:30.524 --> 21:32.526
