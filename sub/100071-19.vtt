Mom, with all the room,

01:02.829 --> 01:04.965
do we have to sit
so close to the geezers?

01:05.032 --> 01:07.301
‐It's too hot.
‐It's too cold.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.603
I'm not even alive.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.072
What time
does Joan Rivers come on?

01:12.139 --> 01:13.340
She doesn't.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.943
This is a church,

Alexa,
play Tranquil Organ Radio.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.319
(organ music playing)

01:26.753 --> 01:28.655
Peace be with you.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.223
ALL:
And also with you.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.392
Oh, you can do better than that.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.795
ALL:
We can, but we don't want to.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.697
I can't hear you.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.699
ALL:
You clearly can.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.667
Lord,
either make this interesting

01:40.734 --> 01:43.003
or just rapture me now.

Salt the ham water, boys.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.119
Clancy Wiggum
is meeting his quota.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.821
Hey! That's illegal.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.389
Oh, sorry. You know what?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.124
Here. Have a quarter, Chief.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.860
You think you can bribe me
with a...? Oh, my God!

02:06.927 --> 02:09.196
Those are the gentlest eyes
I've ever seen.

Linen shirt. Natural highlights.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.033
You want to hold my gun?

02:13.100 --> 02:15.002
Y‐You can.
(chuckles)

02:15.068 --> 02:17.137
Thanks. I was hoping
maybe you could point me

02:17.204 --> 02:18.538
‐to the church in town.
‐Church?

02:18.605 --> 02:20.907
Yeah, straight down this street.
First steeple you see.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.744
That is not it. That's
the Eiffel Tower strip club.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.746
They have
a French onion soup that is,

02:25.812 --> 02:27.347
uh, well, it's just okay.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.517
And I guess

02:30.584 --> 02:31.885
that's about all.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.153
(overlapping shouting)

02:36.423 --> 02:39.459
You shall bore me no more!
(grunts)

02:39.526 --> 02:40.627
You're going the wrong way!

02:40.694 --> 02:42.896
No, I‐I want to go this way.
I love God.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.632
If you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.434
Penny. Button.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.403
IOU for one penny.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.904
Hi. Bode Wright.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.939
Recovery meetings
are downstairs.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.108
Booze to the right,
huffers to the left.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.577
Sorry, I'm here about the ad.
On Christslist?

02:57.644 --> 02:59.579
About you guys needing
a‐a youth pastor?

02:59.646 --> 03:01.081
I didn't place any ad.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.349
I placed the ad.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.917
(Lovejoy groans)

03:03.984 --> 03:06.920
‐I'm Bode.
‐Bode. Nice cross.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.755
Tim's are chewed to nubs.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.391
I‐I chew my crosses.
Nervous habit.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.429
Do you have
any experience, Bode?

03:15.495 --> 03:16.596
I used to work in Michigan.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.899
Had to use bottled holy water.
(chuckles)

03:18.965 --> 03:20.300
Uh‐huh. Education?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.302
I, uh, have a master's
in divinity

03:22.369 --> 03:23.970
with a focus
on biblical languages.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.872
‐Greek, Hebrew...
‐You're hired.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.874
Up‐bup‐bup‐bup‐bup!
It doesn't work that fast.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.378
We have I‐9s and W‐2s,
collar fittings.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.081
And, besides,
<i>I'm</i> the one in charge.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.616
In the end,
isn't God in charge here?

03:36.683 --> 03:39.753
Do you see Jimmy Buffett
at every Jimmy Buffett café?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.288
I don't think so.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.356
Hey, can I have this?
Marge could use it

03:43.423 --> 03:45.125
to serve me snacks
while I'm on the toilet.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.960
‐Oh, just take it.
‐So, Bode,

03:47.027 --> 03:49.162
‐do you have anywhere to stay?
‐Not yet.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.064
I saw a motel by the tire fire.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.938
‐He'll stay with us.
‐No way.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.774
Uh, Reverend? The homeless
are here for their foot washing.

04:00.841 --> 04:05.112
I'm looking for a mani‐pedi
and an eyebrow wax.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.547
I guess I could use
a little help around here.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.316
Thank you. I won't let you down.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.318
We don't hug here.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.153
HELEN:
Mmm.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.523
Uh, I'm here for the
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.860
It's usually me, Lenny, Carl,
Bumblebee Man, Kent Brockman.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.461
But don't tell anyone.

04:21.528 --> 04:22.763
Downstairs to the right.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.965
Also, Lunchlady Dora, King Toot,

04:25.031 --> 04:28.635
and a man I'll identify
as Disco S.

04:28.702 --> 04:32.038
Disco S is quite a mess.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.711
Hmm.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.046
Oh, Marge, this is embarrassing.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.481
We don't need counseling.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.049
We <i>do</i> need counseling.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.851
I'm carrying a lot of anger.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.887
Just do what I do. Come home

04:46.953 --> 04:49.222
and have a hot dinner
waiting for you.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.224
‐(Marge groans)
‐Well, let me just say

04:51.291 --> 04:53.560
that I go into this
with no preconceptions.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.096
Now, tell me,
how is this Homer's fault?

04:56.163 --> 04:59.065
‐He sold our home
without telling me.
‐(grunts)

04:59.132 --> 05:00.634
‐(toy train whistle blows)
‐Helen, is he playing

05:00.700 --> 05:02.102
with my damn trains?

05:02.169 --> 05:05.438
Excuse me. There's trouble
down at Lovejoy Junction.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.873
So, we're good?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.276
We're good
if we get our house back.

05:09.342 --> 05:10.944
Did you say houseboat?

05:11.011 --> 05:13.613
House <i>back.</i> House back!

05:13.680 --> 05:14.681
Oh.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.850
(groaning)

05:20.420 --> 05:22.756
(snoring)

05:22.823 --> 05:24.357
(chokes, coughs)

05:24.424 --> 05:26.593
Sorry, Reverend.
I'm trying to get some rest?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.261
The 12:10 to Trenton
doesn't stop

05:28.328 --> 05:31.431
just because your fat head's
on the track.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.504
‐What are you doing?
‐Nothing.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.905
‐You gonna drop that?
‐Not doing a thing.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.774
As a gag, you're gonna drop
a tiny log on my face?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.375
‐Nothing.
‐As I'm sleeping?
That's, that's‐that's funny.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.777
‐Nothing. Nothing.
‐Go ahead. Drop it.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.078
‐Drop a tiny log on me.
‐Not doing a thing.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.346
Is that... Is that your plan?
You're gonna drop that?

05:46.413 --> 05:48.215
Look, we're both grown men here.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.217
Now leave my choo choo alone.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.585
Gladly.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.553
Aah!

05:53.620 --> 05:56.089
Glad I finally got to use that.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.991
Now, my sleepy, young friend,

05:58.058 --> 06:01.161
I don't know how you did things
back in "Michigan."

06:01.228 --> 06:03.563
Air quotes are for when
something's not a real thing.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.333
But in my parish,
we minister to our flock.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.401
And I'm not afraid
to say the hard things

06:08.468 --> 06:10.237
that need to be said.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.671
"I" 27.

06:11.738 --> 06:13.340
‐What?
‐What did he say?

06:13.406 --> 06:16.076
We can't hear you.

06:16.142 --> 06:19.112
"B" thr‐three.
(coughs)

06:19.179 --> 06:21.181
You know, I'd be happy
to yell out numbers for you.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.349
Help save your voice.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.018
Bingo requires
a firm, experienced caller.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.920
(voice cracks, clears throat):
"G." "G" 48.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.456
(coughing):
"N" for... "N" 43.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.924
I got nothing.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.926
(coughing)

06:32.993 --> 06:34.594
I think I can handle it.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.129
When I was in seminary school,

06:36.196 --> 06:37.931
I was the shouty guy
on our rowing team.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.400
(whispers): We weren't allowed
to say "coxswain."

06:40.467 --> 06:43.169
(coughs)
Bingo is not for newbies.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.139
The letters sound very similar.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.407
"B" 15.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.310
"B" as in Balthazar.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.078
Did he say Galthazar?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.680
Gingo!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.982
Gingo take you to bathroom.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.918
I don't want to go.

06:57.984 --> 07:01.721
Hey, this no picnic
for Gingo either.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.223
Empty again.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.492
And those two
just came here to make out.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.560
(moaning)

07:09.562 --> 07:13.233
If we do it in a church,
I, like, can't get pregnant.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.402
(moaning)

07:15.468 --> 07:17.470
Uh, good mor...
(clears throat, coughs)

07:17.537 --> 07:18.738
Excuse me.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.408
(clears throat)

07:21.474 --> 07:23.843
(coughing)

07:23.910 --> 07:25.979
(groaning)

07:26.046 --> 07:27.580
Brothers and sisters,

07:27.647 --> 07:32.085
Reverend Lovejoy is experiencing
some vocal difficulties.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.820
(grunts, coughs)

07:33.887 --> 07:35.889
Save your voice, Reverend.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.325
Now, we could cancel church.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.626
(excited chatter)

07:39.693 --> 07:41.261
(playing "Maple Leaf Rag")

07:43.697 --> 07:46.299
But God clearly foresaw this

07:46.366 --> 07:48.335
and sent us a backup pastor

07:48.401 --> 07:49.669
to finish the service.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.538
(congregation groans)

07:51.604 --> 07:53.540
<i>Church will not be canceled.</i>

07:53.606 --> 07:56.343
(sobbing)

07:56.409 --> 07:58.178
Now please help me welcome

07:58.244 --> 08:01.414
our new youth minister
Bode Wright.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.116
(confused chatter)

08:03.183 --> 08:05.585
Thanks. That's very meek.
Jesus would've loved it.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.454
I was thinking, while
the reverend rests his voice,

08:07.520 --> 08:09.389
maybe we could all sing a song.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.291
Uh, Rev, if that's okay
with you, um, cough once.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.459
(coughs twice)

08:12.525 --> 08:14.294
We did not establish
what two coughs means,

08:14.361 --> 08:16.196
so I'll take that
to mean two yeses.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.564
(congregation laughs)

08:17.630 --> 08:19.132
Why don't we sing, I don't know,

08:19.199 --> 08:20.700
"Amazing Grace"?
You all know that one.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.469
Or if you don't,
it's in your hymnal under

08:22.535 --> 08:25.305
"grace, comma, amazing."

08:25.372 --> 08:27.374
(playing "Amazing Grace")

08:30.610 --> 08:33.580
♪ <i>Amazing grace,</i>
<i>how sweet the sound</i> ♪

08:33.646 --> 08:37.584
♪ <i>That saved a wretch like me</i> ♪

08:37.650 --> 08:40.487
♪ <i>I once was lost</i>
<i>but now I'm found</i> ♪

08:40.553 --> 08:44.090
♪ <i>'Twas blind, but now I see.</i> ♪

08:44.157 --> 08:46.526
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened

08:46.593 --> 08:48.461
in a white church!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.463
All these years
of mediocre grace.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.033
Finally, it's amazing.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.201
This must've been
what it was like

08:55.268 --> 08:57.103
at Jesus's concerts.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.172
(electric guitar playing)

09:00.774 --> 09:02.642
Thank you. Now we'd, uh,

09:02.709 --> 09:04.577
we'd like to do
a couple of new psalms.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.646
(crowd boos)

09:06.713 --> 09:10.517
‐♪ <i>Hallelujah, hallelu</i> ♪
‐♪ <i>Hallelujah</i> ♪

09:10.583 --> 09:13.353
♪ <i>Hallelujah, hallelu</i> ♪

09:13.420 --> 09:14.487
♪ <i>Hallelujah.</i> ♪

09:16.689 --> 09:18.591
Something exciting's

09:18.658 --> 09:20.126
happening at the church.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.195
Let's check it out.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.933
All right, I think we get it.
Grace, it's amazing.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.302
I know most of you
usually save your "hallelujahs"

09:29.369 --> 09:30.537
for when church is over.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.373
(laughs)
I adore the informality.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.375
But if it's okay, I thought
maybe I could just speak

09:35.442 --> 09:36.543
to you guys
straight from my heart.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.944
I don't have anything planned,

09:38.011 --> 09:39.446
but I guess I should talk
about God, right?

09:39.512 --> 09:40.713
Church. Pastor.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.549
Makes sense
I should talk about God.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.317
But the truth is,
I woke up this morning

09:44.384 --> 09:46.119
and I wasn't really sure
if I believed in God.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.153
(congregation gasps)

09:47.220 --> 09:48.555
No God?

09:48.621 --> 09:49.923
Fingers in your ears, boys.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.791
Till you can feel the brain.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.026
It's okay. Everything's fine.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.427
I‐I just woke up
with some doubt.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.362
Like many of you did, too,
I'm sure.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.031
There's so much pain
and suffering in the world,

09:58.098 --> 10:00.133
I wasn't sure anyone
was really out there.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.868
Watching us. On a cloud.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.103
That's how we think of God,
right?

10:03.169 --> 10:05.371
To many of us,
God is just an angry, old miser

10:05.438 --> 10:07.240
with a killer
surveillance system.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.376
Everyone picks on the miser.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.544
Shave faster or no tip!

10:11.611 --> 10:14.881
Oh, I shave‐a faster, all right.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.983
Hurry up.
I'm going to a funeral.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.620
Oh, you're going to a funeral,
all right.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.789
Oh, this is taking too long.

10:22.856 --> 10:26.025
I got to stop procrastinating.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.660
Then I got quiet
and thought about it.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.029
It hit me that maybe God
isn't up there, you know.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.231
"Somewhere else."

10:31.297 --> 10:32.866
Maybe God's right here and now.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.734
As close as the air
on your skin.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.936
For the first time ever,
I don't feel alone.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.438
Life is worth living.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.707
Hey, forget that hit
I called on myself, huh?

10:40.773 --> 10:42.509
Yeah, well, I said too late.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.844
Can't you just charge me
a stalking fee?

10:44.911 --> 10:46.379
Okay, 40%.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.581
And you can only cancel
on the app.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.350
All right, I‐I'll just, uh...

10:50.416 --> 10:52.118
My screen is frozen!

10:53.520 --> 10:55.622
Maybe God is just
a word for a love

10:55.688 --> 10:57.624
that we create
and remember together.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.726
A love that isn't mad
at us for our doubt

10:59.792 --> 11:02.495
or angry at us
because we're alcoholics.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.930
(sighs)

11:03.997 --> 11:08.434
Finally, recognized
for my accomplishments.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.603
I think so many of us have
made a God that's like us,

11:10.670 --> 11:12.038
instead of the other way around.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.540
God loves diversity.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.375
God didn't just make
one type of flower.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.510
He made thousands
of different flowers‐‐

11:17.577 --> 11:19.078
roses, lilies, orchids‐‐

11:19.145 --> 11:20.780
and He made the weeds, too.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.615
But He loves all of them
indiscriminately.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.217
Just like the bees.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.887
You have made this bumblebee
a humble bee.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.223
Jesus said, "Let the weeds
grow with the wheat."

11:30.290 --> 11:31.791
That means it's all in the game.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.126
Go easy on yourself.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.827
You don't have
to earn God's love.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.596
You <i>are</i> God's love.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.097
All right, that's it.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.566
I know it's early,
but it's a beautiful day.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.900
Let's get out of here.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.969
Sorry, concert's over, dude.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.071
All that's left is the merch.

11:45.138 --> 11:48.007
(chanting):
Bode! Bode! Bode!

11:48.074 --> 11:51.311
CONGREGATION (chanting):
Bode! Bode! Bode!

11:51.377 --> 11:52.745
Three cheers
for Reverend Lovejoy.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.280
Stupid Flanders.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.316
CONGREGATION:
Stupid Flanders!

11:56.382 --> 11:57.951
Stupid
Flanders!

11:58.017 --> 11:59.786
I love church.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.187
I won't be single in Heaven.

12:05.792 --> 12:06.960
This was the best church ever.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.395
It was like some kind
of religious experience.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.164
Will you join us for pancakes?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.632
Are those new vestments?

12:12.699 --> 12:14.234
They really bring out the piety.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.002
You don't have
to patronize me, Ned.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.804
You're, y‐you're right,
I'm sorry.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.772
Y‐You did not do well today.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.608
Oh, go back to patronizing.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.977
Maybe something about my shoes?

12:24.043 --> 12:28.081
Oh, look at those shoes, tied
so tight with loops so even.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.516
Someone knows
the bunny ear technique.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.085
Helen tied them.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.922
Uh, Pastor, would you
like to say grace?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.490
(clears throat)
Lord‐‐

12:37.557 --> 12:39.158
Oh, sorry, I should
have been more specific.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.561
I meant the cool new pastor
everyone likes.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.630
(laughs) You can sit down.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.964
You know, I think
the food is good

12:45.031 --> 12:46.132
without me saying it's good.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.734
God made it good.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.669
Don't get me wrong,
it's nice to be thankful, but

12:49.736 --> 12:51.638
there's no need to make
everyone uncomfortable

12:51.704 --> 12:53.473
by praying in front of 'em,
am I right?

12:53.539 --> 12:56.242
Nice speech, although
longer than grace.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.544
Oh, no bacon for me.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.480
I'm a vegetarian. (chuckles)

13:00.546 --> 13:02.749
And, actually, a Buddhist.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.017
Great. I love Buddha.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.184
That's where I got my name.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.352
The Bodhi Tree.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.520
And I don't eat meat either.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.855
You're a vegetarian?

13:08.921 --> 13:11.090
‐What about evolution?
‐Into it.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.292
‐Gay rights?
‐Love is love.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.893
‐Dizzy or Bird?
‐John Coltrane

13:13.960 --> 13:16.195
and Duke Ellington, 1962.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.398
(gasps) The only way
to describe how perfect

13:18.464 --> 13:21.534
that jazz answer is,
is with jazz.

13:28.941 --> 13:31.244
This brunch has turned into...

13:31.311 --> 13:33.212
a jazz brunch!

13:33.279 --> 13:35.148
I'm a believer.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.383
That's great, Lisa,
but I actually don't think

13:37.450 --> 13:39.419
faith comes down
to what we believe.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.187
Well, you got to believe
in this baloney.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.056
That's how you get into Heaven.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.291
Where maybe,
just maybe, I could see

13:45.358 --> 13:47.794
the mother
that abandoned me again.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.431
Yeah, sure, but I think together

13:51.497 --> 13:54.067
we can bring Heaven here
while we're still alive.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.302
There's a Chinese proverb
about Heaven and Hell.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.038
They say Hell is a long table
like this, full of food,

13:59.105 --> 14:01.974
but everybody's starving because
they have these long chopsticks,

14:02.041 --> 14:04.744
like pool cues, and they can't
bring the food to their mouths.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.246
This is the worst
Year of the Ox ever.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.483
But in the proverb, Heaven is
the exact same table, same food,

14:10.550 --> 14:13.319
same long chopsticks, but
everybody's happy and fat

14:13.386 --> 14:14.987
because they're
feeding each other.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.656
CONGREGATION:
Aw!

14:16.723 --> 14:19.625
Wait, wait! I can be cool,
too... with humor.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.627
Did you hear the one about
the Greek‐Jewish wedding?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.296
They didn't know whether
to break the plates

14:23.363 --> 14:24.697
or the glasses!

14:24.764 --> 14:26.199
(congregation booing)

14:26.265 --> 14:28.801
Yes, why don't you take
your cultural insensitivity

14:28.868 --> 14:31.604
back to the Spanish Inquisition
you came from?

14:31.671 --> 14:32.805
I've lost them.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.807
You never had us.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.547
Timothy, the church council
wants to thank you

14:41.614 --> 14:43.716
for your many years of...

14:43.783 --> 14:45.051
Incompetence!

14:45.118 --> 14:46.219
(gasps)

14:46.285 --> 14:47.420
Knock his frock off.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.622
We like the new guy
in his tight jeans.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.125
Do not resuscitate your career.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.993
What are you saying?
You're firing me?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.529
‐Gingo.
‐Please surrender your cross.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.164
We don't want any trouble.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.368
Timothy.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.174
Now the collar.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.712
And any water
you turned into holy water

15:12.779 --> 15:14.814
is once again regular water.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.883
Nothing but tap.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.760
Did you know Bode has
22,000 YouTube subscribers?

15:27.827 --> 15:29.495
Our church could go viral.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.798
Ugh. Close window.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.167
‐You just subscribed.
‐What? No.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.535
(chuckles):
Now you gave him a thumbs‐up.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.003
Stop telling me what I just did.

15:37.069 --> 15:39.105
You just gave him
an eggplant emoji.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.307
Well, at least
that can't be misconstrued.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.775
Wait a minute.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.044
The Internet can help me.
Help me find something on him.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.679
He's clean on Google.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.214
I'll have to try Bing.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.817
<i>Sorry, I was asleep.</i>

15:50.883 --> 15:53.152
<i>Do you really want to use us?</i>

15:53.219 --> 15:54.787
Yes.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.789
Hmm. Nothing.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.357
But I'm not licked.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.026
Pack your bags, Helen.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.261
We are going to Michigan.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.934
Reverend? We're here
for a little counseling?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.368
Well, I'd be happy to.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.437
But you're already with
the best counselor there is.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.839
‐Your partner.
‐Wait.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.106
But Marge always told me

16:14.173 --> 16:16.008
communication is bad
for a marriage.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.844
I said it was good.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.178
You said what was good?

16:19.245 --> 16:20.446
You just have to know
what it's like

16:20.513 --> 16:21.881
to be in each other's shoes.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.549
Literally.
Put on each other's shoes.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.684
Right now.

16:26.752 --> 16:27.787
HOMER:
All right. They...

16:27.854 --> 16:29.355
(grunting)

16:30.423 --> 16:32.859
Your shoes are so tight.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.393
And you do so much work.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.928
You're an angel.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.864
And your shoes are so heavy.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.500
I never realized
you carried around so much.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.703
I'm starting to see the man
I fell in love with again.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.104
Where? Where? I'll kill him!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.073
‐You.
‐Oh.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.375
I must admit, this is amazing.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.111
But what about the fact
that he sold our house?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.113
‐Um, may I interject?
‐Sure.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.049
I've seen your house.
It'll never pass inspection.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.885
‐Are you sure?
‐Piece of crap.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.355
Thank you, Reverend. Mmm, mmm.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.330
Lisa. What brings you here?

17:11.397 --> 17:13.900
Well, I thought it might be fun
if we meditate together.

17:13.966 --> 17:16.335
Sure. Make yourself at <i>om.</i>

17:16.402 --> 17:20.406
(laughs):
Wow! As meditation jokes go...

17:20.473 --> 17:23.843
That's the only meditation joke
I've ever heard.

17:23.910 --> 17:27.179
Alexa, play Meditation Jam.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.248
(new age music playing)

17:30.917 --> 17:33.352
You know,
science calls it consciousness,

17:33.419 --> 17:36.022
the mystics call it a soul,
but both are just words,

17:36.088 --> 17:37.857
just labels, for whatever it is

17:37.924 --> 17:40.259
that's looking out your eyes
right now.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.762
(inhales)
Breathe, Lisa.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.414
(chuckles): Hey, I'm‐I'm not
trying to change any minds.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.583
I'm just trying
to start a conversation.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.753
We need that.
This town's like a snow globe.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.289
It doesn't look like much
till you shake it up a little.

19:17.356 --> 19:21.093
‐(whimpers)
‐I want redemption
or else, dude.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.695
Or else what?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.563
Or Rabbi Mankiewicz will, dude.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.033
And I have trouble
making that "cch" sound.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.468
It's either Chanukah
or Hanukkah.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.070
Okay? Pick one of those.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.039
(exhales)

19:39.045 --> 19:40.913
Teach a man to microfiche,

19:40.980 --> 19:43.549
and you'll feed him dirt
for a lifetime.

19:43.616 --> 19:47.620
Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the me.

19:49.055 --> 19:52.491
We really should've digitized
that stuff.

19:55.661 --> 19:59.331
Oh, I hope part two
is about my rescue.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.214
I hear there's a little dirt

20:15.281 --> 20:17.717
on the collar of a man
who used to preach here,

20:17.783 --> 20:19.785
Bode Wright.

20:19.852 --> 20:23.556
You, sir,
have challenged me on scripture.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.625
Oh, well, if it's scripture
you want to talk,

20:26.692 --> 20:28.461
then let us make a joyful noise

20:28.527 --> 20:30.763
‐unto the Lord.
‐Good.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.199
Yarr, activism means nothing

20:33.265 --> 20:35.701
if it's not intersectional.
Yarr!
