WEBVTT

01:30.590 --> 01:31.841
<i>In Savannah,</i>

01:32.467 --> 01:35.053
<i>you know a bad storm's coming</i>
<i>when the sky turns black.</i>

01:35.678 --> 01:39.099
<i>With every growl of thunder</i>
<i>you ask yourself,</i>

01:40.141 --> 01:42.519
<i>"When will the heavens part</i>
<i>and offer some relief?"</i>

01:53.071 --> 01:54.656
Come on! We need to go!

02:03.957 --> 02:04.999
Let me go!

02:05.625 --> 02:06.709
Let go of me!

02:32.360 --> 02:33.570
Hey, bloodsucker!

02:55.091 --> 02:56.092
Margot!

03:01.389 --> 03:02.265
Talia.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.314
-You good?
-Yeah.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.607
Good. Let's go.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.326
-We're using the silver-tipped spears.
-Why aren't they dying?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.163
Let's go. Come on.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.457
Hey.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.594
Pops put you on lookout duty.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.597
But Mom always said where my brother goes,
I better follow.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.390
I got you.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.643
Plus, you all needed my help here.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.811
Got vampires on steroids and stuff.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.690
-Oh, shit.
-They're not supposed to do that.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.069
We gotta get out of here. Come on.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.074
-Fall back.
-We can't leave Tess.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.825
I told Tess to meet us by the creek.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.873
You're Guild.
We should be helping my family.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.584
Who are you
to be squawking to me about family?

04:11.668 --> 04:14.420
You sold yours out
as soon as you told that vampire to run.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.756
I promise you'll pay for this.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.674
So will you.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.222
Hey!

04:24.722 --> 04:26.140
Get your ass in the car.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.644
Oh, look, our guests.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.146
Sneaking out so soon?

04:34.023 --> 04:35.066
Get out of here, Jules.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.484
-Back off.
-Go!

04:38.820 --> 04:40.738
-Cal.
-I'm gonna enjoy this.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.699
Let's rock.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.410
Get in the car.

04:49.163 --> 04:49.998
Cal!

04:55.169 --> 04:57.297
Move and I'll feed you to my family.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.103
Goddamn nightcrawler!

05:23.823 --> 05:24.657
Is he...?

05:28.578 --> 05:29.454
Very.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.206
What did I just do?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.335
You saved me.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.424
Grab his legs.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.345
-And then?
-We'll figure it out.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.081
-You killed my parents.
-I had some help.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.553
-Tess, sorry. We have to get out of here.
-Wait!

06:28.179 --> 06:31.099
-Go! We have to go.
-Maybe they're not dead. Wait.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.725
-Go!
-Just check.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.519
Just check.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.400
When are you gonna stop taking trophies?

06:40.483 --> 06:43.152
-Tess wouldn't come. What was I to do?
-Hold your position!

06:44.654 --> 06:46.406
Instead you went full Apollo.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.117
That asshole killed my parents.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.204
I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Does Cal know we're back?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.582
Cal! Cal!

06:57.500 --> 07:00.503
She's not in her room. She left the phone.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.964
-Cook's car isn't out back.
-Call him.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.716
-Call him now.
-I did, and I called the Guild.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.636
-They'll track his phone, call back.
-I doubt it.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.055
I overheard my parents talking.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.058
Wherever he took her, the Guild knows.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.479
Baby, come here.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.734
-I wanna go home.
-I know.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.782
Hey. Hey, I really hate
to break up this family bonding...

07:30.908 --> 07:32.618
but this silver's chafing me.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.747
I am allergic, you know.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.426
We had no idea. Unexpected.
We never would've put you

07:48.509 --> 07:50.720
-in such a position.
-Elinor? Help me.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.221
Oh, my God. Dad!

07:52.305 --> 07:54.640
-Juliette, where is she?
-I don't know.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.976
-Elinor?
-She's fine.

07:57.059 --> 07:57.894
Okay.

07:58.394 --> 08:01.022
I'm fine.
You should have seen the other guy.

08:01.731 --> 08:06.194
My security detail just informed me
your son was captured by those monsters.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.281
Mother.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.911
He's not healing fast enough.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.499
I don't know how I'm ever going
to repair the damage done here.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.875
Did you not hear me?

08:21.626 --> 08:23.085
He is not full Legacy.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.838
He's not healing fast enough.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.425
Least of our worries
is whether your halfling lives or dies.

08:29.509 --> 08:34.889
Least of our worries?
You know that he is everything to me.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.352
I am asking for your help.
He will not make it. If you don't use--

08:39.435 --> 08:41.270
Every Legacy here tonight

08:41.354 --> 08:44.273
is telling themselves
we betrayed them to hunters.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.611
Do you not understand
the gravity of our situation right now?

08:50.613 --> 08:53.407
Excuse me while I arrange security escorts

08:53.491 --> 08:57.078
to get our guests out
of your lovely hunter-infested town.

08:58.871 --> 09:03.125
Your time would be better spent
finding out where they've taken your son.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.509
Calling your bestie is figuring it out?

09:12.426 --> 09:13.427
I'm still figuring.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.680
-What's the emergency?
-My God.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.807
-Why are you wearing my jacket?
-I was cold.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.394
Remember when we pinkie promised

09:21.477 --> 09:24.313
that we would always help each other
out of any mess, any time?

09:24.397 --> 09:27.733
-No questions asked.
-Whenever, whatever, wherever. What?

09:36.826 --> 09:37.910
Take a look.

09:38.786 --> 09:42.832
-Whoa! This is quite a mess.
-I know.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.500
What should we do?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.753
First I'd start by tossing
the year-old fast food.

09:51.007 --> 09:51.841
What?

09:54.719 --> 09:55.553
What?

09:58.180 --> 09:59.682
-Where did he go?
-Who?

10:00.558 --> 10:02.101
The creepy dead guy.

10:04.020 --> 10:04.854
Oh, my God!

10:04.937 --> 10:06.397
What are we looking for?

10:06.480 --> 10:09.609
Bunny, this is Juliette's
new friend, Calliope.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.737
Oh! "Friend" friend?
Or "bring some over here" friend?

10:12.820 --> 10:13.904
-Mom.
-What?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.865
You told me about Jules swapping spit

10:15.948 --> 10:18.492
with some hot thing
at your secret boyfriend's party.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.036
-Why hush-hush?
-Bunny.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.747
Your glass is sweating.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.832
Oh! We can't have that.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.251
Come in for some chocolate cream pie

10:27.335 --> 10:29.462
if you're hungry for something
other than each other.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.671
Good night, Mrs. Wheeler.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.382
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.344
Good night, Letty. Yeah, see you
when you start making sense.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.261
No, no, no!

10:38.220 --> 10:39.221
No, Ben!

10:41.015 --> 10:42.433
-Who are you?
-Creepy dead guy.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.143
Ben!

10:46.270 --> 10:47.938
-Letty, let's go!
-Jules!

10:48.022 --> 10:51.150
Letty, let's go! Come on.
Get away from him. Let's go!

10:57.073 --> 10:58.074
Oh, my God.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.050
Oh, my God.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.639
Letty... Oh, my God.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.786
Honey. You don't look great.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.287
Oh, I'm--

11:45.788 --> 11:46.956
-I am fine.
-Yeah.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.127
Hey. Hey.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.218
Oh.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.351
Let's get you to bed.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.148
-I don't feel like laying down.
-Then sit.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.359
Okay.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.003
Drink.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.207
God.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.969
You saved me once. You gave me
a better life than I ever dreamed of.

13:24.053 --> 13:24.887
No.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.474
We're not having our goodbyes.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.353
You promised me at least
a thousand years together.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.490
-What?
-Grandmother is suggesting

13:44.573 --> 13:46.242
we burn our home down.

13:49.954 --> 13:50.955
Okay.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.171
Hey, you. Come here. Sit with me.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.092
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.136
-Are you in pain?
-Nah.

14:11.892 --> 14:16.480
Promise me that you won't let Davina
run roughshod over your mom, okay?

14:20.442 --> 14:21.277
No.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.279
Not happening.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.866
Don't even try this whole dying thing.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.161
Not leaving me to deal with
this shit show.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.794
Hey, is there any way I can help you?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.129
Yeah.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.423
Help your mom.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.427
She won't ask for it, but she needs it.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.512
No. I'm not leaving you right now.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.437
These didn't work.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.231
The Legacies are still alive,
every last one,

14:59.315 --> 15:01.025
and I don't know where my child is.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.819
The Guild is already
tracking down Clayton Cook

15:03.903 --> 15:06.447
and I'll see to it that Cal gets home.
You have my word.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.450
Your word? The same words
you gave Mike and Sarah?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.079
Do they have Cal?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.167
Absolutely not. She'll be home shortly.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.793
Go upstairs and lie down.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.837
Okay? I'll be up to check on you.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.842
Maybe she should stay with us.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.178
The Guild has protocol.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.597
I don't give a shit
about Guild protocol right now.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.891
I understand you're in a lot of pain.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.602
But this is the mission,

15:36.685 --> 15:38.604
we have wins and losses,

15:38.687 --> 15:42.232
and as far as the Guild's concerned,
you've had a significant win tonight.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.859
Our friends are dead

15:45.027 --> 15:47.279
and my child is missing.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.490
You want me to feel like I got a win?

15:49.990 --> 15:50.991
You find Cook.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.620
Make him bring Cal back. Now.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.632
Haven't you heard of consent?

16:07.508 --> 16:08.634
Nothing is working.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.681
There's something about curium,
says it weakens them.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.684
But it's a radioactive element,
super toxic. Even harder to find.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.353
Do this the old way.
Stake him to the bottom of the river,

16:19.436 --> 16:22.523
-let time and erosion work its magic.
-The Savannah River is not far.

16:22.606 --> 16:26.193
If you guys can avoid the gators
in the sewage runoff, we have a real shot.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.196
But I can hold my breath
for a really long time,

16:29.279 --> 16:31.073
so make sure your calendar's clear.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.701
I say we just take his ass apart,
one bone at a time.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.036
Sounds fun,
have you ever cut the tail off a snake

16:36.120 --> 16:39.039
and watched the baby grow back?
Yeah, we do that.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.168
-Then I guess you won't mind if I try.
-Wait.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.716
I've seen that mark before.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.009
What? His ring?

16:51.719 --> 16:52.678
It's witchcraft.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.145
The hell is that?

17:02.312 --> 17:04.231
Looks like I have a loose thread.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.153
From a Daedra Coven.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.906
-He's bound to a witch?
-Her name's Carmen.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.617
We haven't put a label
on anything just yet.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.257
-Are you okay?
-Stay away.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.175
Okay.

17:32.092 --> 17:32.926
Ben.

17:33.969 --> 17:34.803
It's me.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.431
Okay? It's just me.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.852
Shreveport, 2012, Easter weekend.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.687
What about it?

17:44.438 --> 17:47.357
-The real Letty would understand that.
-We were 8.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.278
Cotton Gin Casino,
your mother was out gambling.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.114
We ordered beignets
and you choked on powdered sugar.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.157
What was I wearing?

17:59.953 --> 18:01.747
You were in your Bieber phase.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.124
Sleeveless jean jacket,
baggy white leather pants.

18:07.586 --> 18:11.673
Maybe you know who I am,
but I still don't know who you are.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.886
-My best friend wouldn't lie to me.
-I was trying to protect you. Okay?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.349
How are you keeping this from your family?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.851
Your mother, she's gonna freak.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.188
-She already knows.
-She accepts it?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.108
Yeah. The whole family does.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.487
They had to since they're vampires too.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.200
-Holy shit.
-Yeah.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.871
-Even Elinor?
-Ben.

18:43.747 --> 18:44.748
New Year's Eve,

18:44.832 --> 18:49.128
2016, when you kissed me,
were you just taking a little taste?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.254
Oh, my God.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.506
-Working up to the big chop?
-You kissed me.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.717
Neither of us knew
what we were doing that night.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.053
I don't wanna drink everyone in sight.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.724
You spent seven minutes
in a pantry with Cal

19:02.808 --> 19:04.351
and she finds out your big secret.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.231
I've known you my whole life,
you've never said a word. Is that fair?

19:10.691 --> 19:12.860
My whole life I was told...

19:14.194 --> 19:15.988
never tell anyone what we are.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.158
Or the whole family would be in jeopardy.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.035
So you're right.

19:22.995 --> 19:23.996
It's not fair.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.915
None of this is fair.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.919
Trust me, no one was more surprised
about Juliette than me.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.548
But she saved our lives tonight.

19:45.767 --> 19:49.438
-Where are you going?
-To get my Taylor Swift blanket, my keys,

19:50.105 --> 19:52.232
and some paper towels for your face.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.619
You're really leaving.

20:05.787 --> 20:11.084
I need to go back to Paris and strategize
and ready myself for battle,

20:11.168 --> 20:14.129
in case anybody wants
to dethrone me for this.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.632
And my father?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.218
What will happen to him?

20:21.261 --> 20:23.388
He's half-made, sweetheart.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.768
When wounded,
they die sooner than they heal.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.813
Your mother understood that
when she turned him.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.775
Another reason why
she should have gone through

20:34.858 --> 20:37.069
with the marriage I arranged for her.

20:39.238 --> 20:43.200
You'd allow my father to die
because you're still angry with Mother

20:43.283 --> 20:45.994
-for leaving Henry Davenport at the altar.
-No.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.288
No. Aggrieved.

20:48.830 --> 20:53.835
Ashamed, of course,
but the anger, it left a long time ago.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.839
I wouldn't be here
if she'd married into that family.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.883
Oh, you'd still be you.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.345
You got the impressive
half of your DNA from me.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.766
We are alike, in almost every way.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.144
You use your power to get what you want.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.729
And so do I.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.943
So tell me, what do you want
in exchange for my father's life?

21:20.904 --> 21:23.282
Nothing you can give me, sweet girl.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.666
Davenport clan has two sons.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.626
Very eligible bachelors.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.754
Let me fix what Mother broke.

21:58.066 --> 21:58.984
Oh, wait.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.946
-You got me that blanket on her tour.
-I'll wash it one more time.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.407
I don't think
you can wash away the stench of murder.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.786
Ground's too soft. A stiff wind,
they'll smell him all the way in Atlanta.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.166
Over there.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.710
That's far,
and I need to get this done and get home.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.588
My God. My parents
formed a search party by now.

22:19.671 --> 22:24.343
Then chop-chop. He needs to be better
hidden, uphill of the wind, blah, blah.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.803
Okay.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.266
How many times have you done this?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.643
I'm not a psycho,
if that's what you're implying.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.898
He listens to <i>Serial, Up and Vanished.</i>
That kind of stuff.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.028
Sebastian, hey.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.781
Okay. Here, drink.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.201
-Just drink.
-I'm tired, Margot.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.243
-I know.
-Margot.

22:50.327 --> 22:53.205
I understand,
but you cannot give up. Drink.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.626
-I'm trying.
-Come on, baby. Just, please?

22:57.709 --> 22:59.252
-I can't.

23:02.589 --> 23:03.882
Get out!

23:03.965 --> 23:06.343
It's okay. Grandmother's going to help.

23:06.426 --> 23:10.222
I couldn't let my poor, dear Elinor
suffer this loss, so...

23:12.224 --> 23:13.850
I'm not leaving you alone with him.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.437
I don't think you have much of a choice.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.566
Mother, please.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.655
Where you go, I go.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.588
Hello, my girl.

23:46.091 --> 23:46.925
Careful.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.220
She can smell fear.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.014
I was fine letting you die,

23:53.098 --> 23:56.017
but your daughter
offered to repair my wounds,

23:56.101 --> 23:59.062
so I'm going to repair yours.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.485
Good girl.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.710
-Left.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.545
No, her left. Cal, just--

24:26.715 --> 24:29.551
-My parents are gonna kill me.
-Mine are furious.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.344
I'm gonna be grounded for life.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.763
Bunny's watching <i>Below Deck </i>without me.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.015
-Oh, my God.
-What?

24:35.098 --> 24:37.434
-Someone's here.
-We've been followed?

24:37.517 --> 24:38.643
Shh!

24:40.520 --> 24:42.063
-Noah?
-Hey, Ben.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.691
-Phillipa.
-Hey, Ben.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.569
-Phillipa.
-We were on our way to a party

24:47.652 --> 24:49.196
when we saw your car. Everything okay?

24:50.155 --> 24:51.031
We're fine.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.034
You don't look fine.

24:54.910 --> 24:55.744
No.

24:57.037 --> 24:57.871
We, um...

24:59.039 --> 25:01.833
-Truth is, we're not fine.
-What's wrong?

25:02.709 --> 25:06.463
Ben was upset about Ashley.
So we came out here.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.381
To remember her.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.842
Oh, gosh.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.511
-Oh, Benny.
-That's fine.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.721
Oh, my sweet, sweet Benny.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.057
She loved drinking in the park.

25:18.141 --> 25:21.269
I wish you would've told me
you were having a hard time. I am too.

25:25.148 --> 25:29.236
-This is kind of perfect.
-It is?

25:33.657 --> 25:35.242
Smashley's fave.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.787
We can all remember her together.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.163
To Ashley.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.384
Everybody out.

25:52.968 --> 25:53.802
Now.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.137
-Babe.
-Babe.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.267
We'll be out front.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.018
Let's go, guys.

26:06.147 --> 26:06.982
Bye, guys.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.567
I had a good time.

26:14.155 --> 26:17.784
The Guild traced Cal
to your parents' house.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.122
Where is my daughter,
you goddamned nightcrawler?

26:22.205 --> 26:24.624
She was taken to the estate by my sister.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.460
Elinor, the mean one.

26:35.635 --> 26:40.473
You knew that Cal had been kidnapped the
whole time and then you didn't say a word.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.435
You start talking.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.440
Elinor brought your Cal
to Juliette as a gift.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.652
I got her a nice gift card and cash,
but Elinor has always been a bit extra.

26:53.236 --> 26:54.279
Where's Cal now?

26:54.362 --> 26:56.615
Last I saw, she was tied to a tree.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.909
Where is my goddamn daughter?

27:03.663 --> 27:06.249
You'd give your life
for your daughter, wouldn't you?

27:09.586 --> 27:11.880
If I knew where your Cal was,
I'd tell you.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.054
Wow, to be loved like that.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.767
I wish my parents
cared about me that much, but they don't.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.312
I'm sure they're happy now,
thinking I'm dead.

27:27.395 --> 27:28.355
Bullshit.

27:28.438 --> 27:33.485
No parent wants to lose a child ever.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.279
Yeah, I'm different.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.074
I disturbed them.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.827
And with the help of my sister,
they decided I was evil.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.247
They hid me halfway across the world

27:46.331 --> 27:49.376
to protect their coveted life
in their beloved Savannah.

27:49.459 --> 27:52.128
Oliver, do you know
where Calliope is or not?

27:53.505 --> 27:56.174
I bet she's with Jules, the harmless one.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.426
-Poor lamb.
-Okay.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.472
Well, your poor lamb
tried to kill my daughter.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.147
-Hello?
-Margot?

28:14.859 --> 28:16.611
-Oliver?
-They have him?

28:16.695 --> 28:17.862
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

28:18.446 --> 28:22.575
That's the sound of my screwdriver
driving into your son's neck.

28:23.702 --> 28:27.664
And that's the sound of me
not giving a shit how loud he screams.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.042
I want my daughter back.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.086
Your daughter?

28:39.551 --> 28:43.388
How about we meet at my place?
You obviously know how to get here.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.640
Oh, my place is available as well.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.561
Neutral ground it is.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.149
Oh, my head is killing me.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.234
They need to go so we can leave.

28:56.943 --> 28:57.944
Driving me crazy.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.532
Wanna go take a walk?

29:06.995 --> 29:08.788
I can't believe you got everybody...

29:08.872 --> 29:10.874
Yeah. Let's go.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.305
Do you wanna talk about it?

29:27.182 --> 29:28.016
Do you?

29:29.934 --> 29:30.769
Yeah.

29:33.354 --> 29:35.315
But I don't know what to say.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.194
-You can start with--
-How it felt?

29:39.277 --> 29:40.278
Mm-hm.

29:42.155 --> 29:42.989
Okay.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.283
Right.

29:47.702 --> 29:48.536
It felt...

29:51.915 --> 29:52.749
right.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.294
And I feel different.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.173
How do you feel...

30:01.758 --> 30:02.842
seeing me do that?

30:05.261 --> 30:06.095
Weird.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.517
Really... weird.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.271
But, like, I know you better now.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.484
I know what you'll do
for the people you care about.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.576
Did you know this tree was here?

30:29.744 --> 30:30.787
Of course not.

30:31.871 --> 30:32.705
Why?

30:35.917 --> 30:37.043
It was in my dream.

30:38.127 --> 30:38.962
Your dream.

30:39.754 --> 30:41.214
You know what I'm talking about.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.968
You're accusing me of planning this?

30:46.052 --> 30:46.886
Seriously?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.889
Then why did you come back
to help me tonight?

30:50.723 --> 30:51.850
Why didn't you run away?

30:51.933 --> 30:55.436
-I did, but then I heard you scream.
-But I couldn't scream.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.482
I mean, inside I was screaming,
but he taped my mouth.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.110
I couldn't make a sound.

31:08.783 --> 31:09.868
You're in my head.

31:11.953 --> 31:16.875
You bit me, and now I don't even know
if what I'm feeling is you or me or--

31:16.958 --> 31:18.960
I betrayed my family to save you.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.839
I did that because I know
my feelings for you are real.

31:26.009 --> 31:29.053
If you don't feel the same,
I'm the one who should be questioning--

32:35.536 --> 32:37.789
-Phillipa looks happy.
-Whatever.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.167
-Ben.
-Mr. Fairmont.

32:42.043 --> 32:45.713
-What are you doing here?
-I could ask you the same question.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.091
We were just paying--

32:49.133 --> 32:51.302
Giving an-- Honoring Ashley--

32:51.386 --> 32:52.804
Where's Juliette, Ben?

32:53.763 --> 32:58.309
She's probably--
Probably still on the scavenger hunt.

32:59.936 --> 33:03.314
Oh, here they come now.
Yeah, run, guys, you won.

33:03.398 --> 33:06.317
Hey, we just came back from, um...

33:07.151 --> 33:08.611
From a fake scavenger hunt.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.405
Nice try, Ben.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.492
-Let's go.
-We'll follow you.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.412
-I'm sure Ben can give me a ride.
-I am sure that he will not.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.998
I would suggest you all go too.

33:20.498 --> 33:23.918
The cop that tipped me off about
spotting my daughter at an illegal bonfire

33:24.002 --> 33:26.921
has agreed to give you all ten minutes
to get out of here.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.882
Put that fire out and go.

33:32.093 --> 33:36.222
-I don't believe we've been introduced.
-Dad, this is Cal.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.600
-We were just about to take her home.
-No.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.103
Not a chance
I'm letting you get behind the wheel.

33:42.812 --> 33:47.191
I can give Cal a ride home. Unless
you prefer to have Savannah PD do that.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.741
Juliette, before the sun comes up.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.704
You're safe with me.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.414
Promise.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.482
-You're not listening.
-Not the time.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.901
He's evil. This is just like before.

34:30.651 --> 34:33.196
What if he told them
there's a way to end our lives to--

34:33.279 --> 34:35.156
He would never do that. No Legacy would.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.449
-Ever.
-Oliver might.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.659
Your brother is still one of us.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.620
We're not having this conversation.

34:40.703 --> 34:44.832
Oliver is a self-destructive psychopath
with serious attachment issues.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.088
-Which one do you want?
-Don't leave the car.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.842
We're not killing anyone.

34:59.472 --> 35:00.681
Get out of my truck.

35:03.726 --> 35:04.852
Hey, not so rough.

35:06.145 --> 35:09.482
-We don't wanna provoke her.
-We brought a war to her backdoor.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.984
We're past provoking her.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.031
I'm gonna be grounded for life.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.492
I guess we could always
see each other in our dreams.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.286
Kidding.

35:23.871 --> 35:24.789
Mostly kidding.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.676
He missed the turn.

35:40.096 --> 35:40.930
Dad.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.517
-You missed the turn.
-I know where I'm going.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.770
This isn't the way to my house.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.232
Dad.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.609
Dad, you're going the wrong way.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.991
What's happened to you?

36:06.455 --> 36:08.416
Watch out. Dad, look out!

36:27.185 --> 36:28.227
Cal!

36:32.023 --> 36:32.857
Juliette!

36:35.610 --> 36:36.444
Juliette!

36:42.491 --> 36:44.619
-What's happening?

36:45.203 --> 36:49.207
-Are you doing this?
-She loves me, she loves me not.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.710
You can take your whole family out,
but not until I get my daughter back.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.545
-Do you hear me?
-Sorry.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.007
I don't see my daughter.

36:58.841 --> 37:01.427
Seems the girls had other ideas.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.054
Then why are you here?

37:04.263 --> 37:05.765
To talk to my son.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.141
Heya, mama bear.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.018
Nice jacket.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.938
Enough with the cheap tricks.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.648
I wouldn't call her that.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.108
Why are you doing this?

37:16.859 --> 37:18.527
Why does anyone do anything?

37:22.281 --> 37:23.115
For love.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.326
Oliver.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.620
Please, wait. Oliver.

37:28.746 --> 37:29.956
What are you doing?

37:30.039 --> 37:30.873
And revenge.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.334
It's good to be back.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.336
No!

37:35.419 --> 37:36.796
Oliver!

37:36.879 --> 37:37.713
Oliver.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.301
Shit! Where did he go?

37:47.682 --> 37:48.766
Cal!

37:59.652 --> 38:01.320
I never should have listened to you.

38:09.036 --> 38:09.870
I'm sorry.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.040
You say that a lot.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.212
And you don't say it ever.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.051
I'm scared, okay?

38:27.805 --> 38:30.141
-Your dad is freaking me out.
-Juliette!

38:30.808 --> 38:31.976
Come back here.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.061
Both of you, come back.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.231
<i>When you're</i>
<i>in the middle of a storm,</i>

38:37.773 --> 38:39.483
<i>thekind where the sky turns black</i>

38:39.567 --> 38:42.194
<i>and thereseems to be nolight</i>
<i>attheendofthetunnel,</i>

38:42.695 --> 38:43.946
<i>you have two choices.</i>

38:45.197 --> 38:49.410
<i>You can wait for the heavens to part,</i>
<i>offer even a tiny bit of relief.</i>

38:50.870 --> 38:52.788
-Juliette!
-<i>Or you can run.</i>

38:52.872 --> 38:54.248
Juliette, stop!

38:55.833 --> 38:57.710
<i>And keep running</i>

38:57.793 --> 39:00.463
<i>until the growl of thunder</i>
<i>disappears behindyou.</i>
