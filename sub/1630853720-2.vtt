WEBVTT

00:15.724 --> 00:16.933
Skadoosh.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.854
Lou-ee-ooh!

00:20.937 --> 00:23.273
Loojee?

00:23.356 --> 00:24.441
Luigi?

00:24.524 --> 00:26.317
Looney?

00:26.401 --> 00:27.235
Lunu?

00:30.196 --> 00:32.615
Lou-ee-lai! Lalailoo!

00:32.699 --> 00:35.118
Lukulululu? Lu?

00:35.201 --> 00:37.120
I know it's an L word. Um…

00:37.203 --> 00:39.748
-Lorelai?

00:42.792 --> 00:43.793
Leela?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.211
Ow.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.005
Lila… What was her name?

00:50.341 --> 00:52.177
Will you stop it, Veruca?

00:57.640 --> 00:59.976
Careful with that. Our work's not done.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.896
Just having a bit of fun.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.900
-Hm… Quite a river.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.620
Oh, pretty.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.042
-Ah…

01:36.429 --> 01:38.014
Oh, scary.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.808
Scaly and scary!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.813
You look lost.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.818
Wouldn't be,
if you could point us toward the Lotus?

01:49.901 --> 01:53.238
-Lotus? What is that?

01:54.280 --> 02:00.120
This is our river, that's our bridge,
and this is our mountain pass.

02:00.203 --> 02:04.124
And nobody crosses it
without paying a fee.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.006
How about that pretty glove?

02:15.677 --> 02:17.595
You want the glove, do you?

02:18.179 --> 02:20.932
-Do you?

02:21.015 --> 02:22.767
You've got it.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.586
That silly bear
probably wandered into a ditch.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.005
Broke her legs. Needs my help.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.257
That's why she should've waited for…

02:56.259 --> 02:58.261
The Dragon Master!

03:02.098 --> 03:05.226
I mean, you know,
former Dragon Master. Whatever.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.070
What?

03:16.988 --> 03:17.989
Glowy thumb.

03:18.072 --> 03:18.907
Weird.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.790
Watch the rock!

03:31.085 --> 03:33.129
-Dramatic.

03:38.176 --> 03:42.597
I was gonna show you my secret way
through the Kai Yu River Pass, remember?

03:43.181 --> 03:47.060
I said I was leaving in the morning.
The sun rose three hours ago.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.895
Oh. You know why?

03:48.978 --> 03:51.022
My mornings usually start around 11.

03:51.105 --> 03:54.442
I don't know. I guess the sun
rises earlier in England or something.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.402
That's not how the sun works.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.071
Well, I can still help you.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.447
You're going to help me?

03:59.530 --> 04:02.116
The panda I just watched
trip down an entire mountain?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.993
That wasn't my fault. It's this thumb.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.162
It's got a mind of its own.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.168
Uh…

04:13.795 --> 04:16.089
Hm. I dunno,
maybe it's asleep or something.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.139
You've been hiking for three hours
and I caught up to you in one.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.184
You need me.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.187
Hm?

04:32.188 --> 04:33.648
Fine.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.485
-You may show me your shortcut.
-For real?! I mean…

04:37.568 --> 04:39.070
For real?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.412
Okay, okay, so, like,
if we're gonna partner up--

04:47.495 --> 04:48.913
We're not partners.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.957
You can teach me how to be a knight,

04:51.040 --> 04:53.668
and I can teach you kung fu.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.921
And then we can become kung fu knights!

04:57.005 --> 04:59.382
Knights of kung fu? Kung foots?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.301
Hm. I'm workshopping it.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.969
You? A knight?

05:03.052 --> 05:06.097
It takes years.
You start as a knight's page.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.182
If you're lucky,
you're promoted to squire.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.185
And then, maybe,
if you've managed a heroic deed,

05:11.269 --> 05:13.855
they'll recommend you
to the Queen for knighthood.

05:13.938 --> 05:17.859
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So how do I become a page?

05:17.942 --> 05:20.278
Impress me.

05:20.361 --> 05:23.239
That's kinda my whole thing.
I'm pretty impress--

05:23.323 --> 05:24.490
Tushie-smash!

05:24.574 --> 05:27.493
Let me just take five. Ooh, yeah!

05:44.594 --> 05:45.428
Nice.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.435
-Uh, looks tasty.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.649
-I'm not concerned with tasty.
-Try this.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.694
My dad's world-famous red chili crisp.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.702
Hm?

06:14.832 --> 06:17.627
Oh. Oh, my--

06:20.838 --> 06:22.840
Yeah, it's pretty hot-- Whoa!

06:23.341 --> 06:25.885
-You poisoned me!
-What?

06:26.469 --> 06:27.720
No, I didn't!

06:31.974 --> 06:34.143
It's just spicy!
It'll pass, I promise!

06:44.195 --> 06:46.322
Pretty good, right?

06:51.202 --> 06:53.287
Uh, pretty quick with that sword.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.832
Don't put
your grubby paws near it.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.543
This sword was forged with
the Black Steel of the Equinox.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.589
Black Steel of the Equinox?!

07:04.090 --> 07:06.384
I don't know what that means
but it sounds awesome.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.678
Black Steel of the Equinox!

07:08.761 --> 07:11.222
That is so fun to say.
Try saying that, go ahead.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.933
Black Steel of the Equinox isn't fun.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.602
It's the same metal
Sir Galaham the Brooding used

07:16.686 --> 07:19.730
to forge his great axe, Bone Kisser.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.483
There was an axe called Bone Kisser?!

07:23.067 --> 07:24.360
That's nothing.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.196
Sir Rabbit of Devon had a bow so strong

07:27.280 --> 07:31.951
it could fire an arrow through
ten of her enemies at once, like butter.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.327
You know what she called it?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.247
Butter Bow?

07:36.831 --> 07:38.124
Skullpiercer.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.126
Wow, cool!

07:40.710 --> 07:41.919
Gross…

07:42.003 --> 07:43.963
So, how do you know all that?

07:44.797 --> 07:45.965
It's all right here,

07:46.048 --> 07:47.800
in the Knight's Code.

07:51.262 --> 07:54.307
Okay, cool.
So, what's the deal with these weasels?

07:54.849 --> 07:58.019
Klaus and Veruca are mages.

07:58.102 --> 08:01.772
Well, a sect of mages,
ones with bad intent.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.149
For hundreds of years,

08:03.232 --> 08:06.944
they've used their dark powers
to manipulate their way into society.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.072
Only recently
did the knights discover their plans

08:10.156 --> 08:11.824
and banish them from England.

08:13.117 --> 08:17.205
But not until after Klaus and Veruca
infiltrated the Queen's inner circle,

08:17.288 --> 08:19.415
and made an attempt on her life,

08:19.957 --> 08:22.460
destroying any who stood in their path.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.090
The Queen survived
and Veruca was captured.

08:30.718 --> 08:35.932
But Klaus eventually freed his sister
and fled here, and now I know why.

08:36.015 --> 08:40.269
The gauntlet. With its power, I fear
they will tear through England's defenses,

08:40.353 --> 08:43.356
leaving a river of carnage
right to the palace doors.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.236
You see now why I cannot wait?

08:51.322 --> 08:54.033
Why I must stop them
before they leave these shores?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.327
Oh, yeah, right.

08:57.578 --> 08:58.788
I should go.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.415
-So, am I--
-Guiding me on your shortcut

09:01.499 --> 09:05.086
so I refrain from boiling your innards
for my next cup of tea?

09:05.169 --> 09:06.003
Up to you.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.422
You want shortcuts?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.550
We'll get you there yesterday.

09:12.718 --> 09:16.931
Me, a knight's page,
serving you and your very long name.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.560
It's Luthera of Landreth,
the Wandering Blade,

09:20.643 --> 09:23.479
Daughter of the Saxon Guard,
Knight of England.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.815
Yeah,
that's like half a day saying that.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.943
If I'm gonna be your page,
can I just call you Wandering Blade?

09:29.026 --> 09:31.529
Or WB? Ooh, that's pretty good.

09:31.612 --> 09:35.032
WB. W, W, W… Debby! Yeah.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.034
No?

09:37.994 --> 09:41.414
Okay, Wandering Blade. Okay, yes.
That's the coolest part anyway.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.958
If you were going to be my page,

09:44.041 --> 09:48.004
you would have to scrub my boots,
carry my gear, make camp.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.882
If necessary, a page
will give their life for their knight.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.343
I can totally do some of that.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.928
I almost die all the time!

09:57.138 --> 10:00.725
You may start
by carrying my helmet.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.936
You impressed yet?

10:05.730 --> 10:06.564
No.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.357
Come on.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.527
Oh, I'm so gonna impress you.
Just you watch.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.696
If you really want to be my page,

10:13.779 --> 10:16.115
you need to stop
messing around with silly shortcuts

10:16.198 --> 10:17.742
and get me to this ri--

10:19.368 --> 10:21.621
-River.

10:30.129 --> 10:33.966
You didn't think it was worth mentioning
that this river is made of lava?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.761
I know, right?

10:36.844 --> 10:39.930
It's pretty intense.
Don't worry, there's a bridge right over--

10:43.517 --> 10:45.394
Okay, the bridge is gone.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.022
But hey, at least
we know for a fact they came this way!

10:48.606 --> 10:50.858
It's one of them gauntlet craters!

10:54.487 --> 10:56.155
Huh? Huh?

10:56.697 --> 11:00.076
-I'm running out of time.
-We are running out of time.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.162
Come on! If we don't stick together,
how am I supposed to impress--

11:03.663 --> 11:05.539
-You…

11:07.625 --> 11:09.043
-Ow!

11:14.590 --> 11:16.592
You stopped me in Wankun,

11:16.676 --> 11:20.679
as far as I know you took us the long way
so you could go vegetable picking,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.432
and now I'm stuck on
the wrong side of a lava river

11:23.516 --> 11:26.310
because your secret way across
was to take the bridge!

11:26.894 --> 11:29.230
We're stuck on
the wrong side of a lava river.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.148
You kinda gotta get used to saying "we."

11:32.483 --> 11:34.443
Go home, Po.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.113
There is no "we."

11:40.741 --> 11:43.452
I never said the bridge
was my secret way across!

11:49.542 --> 11:51.377
I am the river.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.378
What is that?

11:52.461 --> 11:54.713
What are you do-- What are you doing?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.341
Just trying to summon
some inner peace here,

11:57.425 --> 11:59.135
if you could just give me half a sec.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.850
I am the river.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.854
I am the rock.

12:09.937 --> 12:10.771
I am…

12:15.985 --> 12:17.361
Po the Page.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.282
Po!

12:41.218 --> 12:44.972
This little piggy went to market,

12:45.055 --> 12:48.476
this little piggy's on fire,
this little piggy got roasted…

12:53.022 --> 12:53.856
So.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.149
Impressed yet?

12:55.649 --> 12:57.485
I, uh…

12:57.568 --> 12:59.195
How did you do that?

12:59.278 --> 13:02.823
Kung fu! I did have a life
before I was your page, you know.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.580
Here.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.334
Tie it to that tree trunk.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.587
I saw you walk the tightrope yesterday,
you can totally make this.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.714
Where are you going to tie it?

13:23.677 --> 13:25.262
Uh, I'll hold it.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.849
Uh, y-yeah, no. Uh…

13:28.933 --> 13:32.561
Oh, come on!
It'll be my first charge as your page.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.233
You sure you're strong enough?

13:37.316 --> 13:38.901
You have trust issues.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.570
No, I have "you" issues.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.921
Whoa!

13:59.004 --> 14:02.758
-Alright, got it. Okay, yeah.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.302
Everything okay over there?

14:05.386 --> 14:07.346
Oh, yeah. No sweat.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.807
My arm just, uh, you know, fell asleep.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.394
-Kidding. Just a joke.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.479
Po, behind you!

14:15.563 --> 14:17.106
Oh, I get it.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.567
No, no, you aren't pranking me.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.735
Behind you!

14:25.406 --> 14:26.907
Dragon Master?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.242
Chuntao!

14:28.325 --> 14:31.161
Though I suppose
that's not your name anymore.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.746
Whoa!

14:32.830 --> 14:35.958
We all heard about
your little tumble from grace.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.756
Friends of yours?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.926
Uh, not exactly. This is Chuntao.

14:46.010 --> 14:50.306
I kinda put him in jail a few years ago
for hijacking the old Emperor's new wagon.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.808
All to impress a girl. I got this covered.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.438
Chuntao! How's Dai-Tai?

14:59.857 --> 15:01.817
We broke up.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.986
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.113
Yeah. She wanted a bigger house!

15:06.196 --> 15:08.949
And it's, like,
"I'm trying my best here, Dai-Tai!"

15:09.033 --> 15:12.286
And she's, like,
"We live in a literal hole in the wall!"

15:12.369 --> 15:13.203
Po?

15:13.787 --> 15:16.123
-Po!

15:19.251 --> 15:22.171
You know there's a fee
for crossing our river.

15:22.671 --> 15:26.842
But since we have history and all, I'll
give you a friends and family discount.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.220
Aw! See, there's nothing to worry about!
They're giving us--

15:30.304 --> 15:33.182
Whoa. Interesting discount.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.271
We'll take the sword!

15:54.703 --> 15:55.537
Ow!

15:57.539 --> 15:58.374
Po!

15:58.457 --> 16:02.002
-Stop moving!
-I'm doing my best over here!

16:19.353 --> 16:23.649
-Maybe we just give them the sword?

16:23.732 --> 16:26.026
No one touches my sword.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.705
So cool.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.379
It's slipping. Blade!

16:45.462 --> 16:47.214
Blade! I can't hold it.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.049
-Yes, you can!

16:51.719 --> 16:52.970
It's too heavy!

16:53.470 --> 16:54.722
You're strong enough!

17:10.738 --> 17:12.906
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

17:21.498 --> 17:23.917
Do not drop that rope, Po!

17:24.001 --> 17:26.795
-Ooh, yeah. Come on!

17:30.924 --> 17:34.094
-As your page, that wasn't my fault.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.388
-The rope just broke.
-Will you shut it and run?

17:36.972 --> 17:40.017
You better turn tail and run.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.895
This is the tail end of your story.

17:42.978 --> 17:43.896
Tail pun.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.261
-I'll hold them back.
-Yoink!

18:16.345 --> 18:18.639
-No!

18:18.722 --> 18:21.225
Now we're even, Dragon Master.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.437
-Okay. You just wait there.

18:25.521 --> 18:29.149
I'll get the Black Steel of the Equinox
after I take care of these guys.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.616
It's called Luthera's Shield,
and no one touches it but me.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.452
Your sword
is named Luthera's Shield?

18:40.536 --> 18:41.620
But it's a sword!

18:41.703 --> 18:44.665
But it guards me. Like a shield.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.459
-What are you doing?

18:47.543 --> 18:50.337
Getting my sword back,
before he gets away with it.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.424
Is this what you're after?
Come and get it.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.850
Blade!

19:07.062 --> 19:08.272
-Gotcha.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.692
Blade, come on. Soloing isn't working out.
Let's do this together.

19:12.693 --> 19:17.114
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?
We fall into a little lava, maybe we die.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.950
Or maybe we do something heroic!

19:20.033 --> 19:22.119
-As knight and page!

19:58.322 --> 20:00.073
Ow, ow, ow! Hot!

20:01.950 --> 20:05.120
You're running out of
mountains to hide in, Chuntao,

20:05.204 --> 20:06.663
and you're out of lizards.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.876
And when we catch you, we're taking back
the Black Steel of the Equinox!

20:11.376 --> 20:13.170
This thing is black steel?

20:13.921 --> 20:17.007
Wow. I'm gonna be rich!

20:17.090 --> 20:19.676
And then Dai-Tai
will have to take me back!

20:22.638 --> 20:26.683
Nice try, Dragon Master,
but there's always more lizards.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.738
Po!

20:40.364 --> 20:42.199
Po!

20:56.630 --> 20:58.632
I am the river.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.389
I am the rock.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.849
I am Po,

21:07.933 --> 21:11.019
the former Dragon Master!

21:13.063 --> 21:14.481
Hiyah!

21:17.609 --> 21:20.112
Whoa, what? Sorry, Jim!
Sorry, Ralph! Sorry, Mom!

21:21.113 --> 21:22.823
Can't you take it easy on me?

21:22.906 --> 21:26.118
I'll give you the friends
and family discount. Skadoosh!

21:26.201 --> 21:28.996
Nice callback!

21:37.462 --> 21:39.464
Whew! Okay.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.758
-So?
-Po.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.553
I'm impressed.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.848
-Aw, yeah!

21:53.312 --> 21:55.605
-Po?
-No, it wasn't me. It's the thumb!

21:55.689 --> 21:57.107
It's awake!

22:10.120 --> 22:12.914
-Whoa. The thumb.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.293
The thumb wakes up
when they use the gauntlet.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.794
Seems safe to say.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.140
So…

22:30.223 --> 22:32.434
Looks like you kinda do need me.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.351
No.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.147
-But I do need your thumb.
