the Harry Quebert Affair...

00:07.698 --> 00:08.759
Harry Quebert,

00:08.859 --> 00:10.601
allow me to present
Elijah Stern,

00:10.701 --> 00:11.842
who generously
funds this Gala.

00:11.942 --> 00:13.123
Oh.

00:13.223 --> 00:15.606
He also owns the house
you're renting at Goose Cove.

00:15.706 --> 00:17.488
Mr. Stern, a pleasure.

00:17.588 --> 00:19.570
I'd like to introduce you
to my right-hand man.

00:19.670 --> 00:21.492
Harry Quebert.

00:21.592 --> 00:22.673
[speech impediment]
Good evening, Mr. Quebert.

00:22.753 --> 00:24.615
My name is Luther Caleb.

00:24.715 --> 00:26.337
Look what I found
in his house.

00:26.437 --> 00:27.658
It's a nude painting.

00:27.758 --> 00:29.780
Look closer, Sherlock.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.303
Yeah, that's a naked painting
of Nola Kellergan

00:32.403 --> 00:34.665
in Elijah Stern's house, okay?

00:34.765 --> 00:36.227
Signed "LC."

00:36.327 --> 00:38.269
His chauffeur,
Luther Caleb.

00:38.369 --> 00:40.391
When I brought him up,
Stern went radio silent.

00:40.491 --> 00:41.712
I got Barnaski to back off.

00:41.812 --> 00:43.314
He's agreed to tear up
your contract.

00:43.414 --> 00:44.555
[Marcus]:
Yeah, in exchange for what?

00:44.655 --> 00:46.077
<i>All you have to do</i>

00:46.177 --> 00:48.559
<i>is write a book about</i>
<i>the Harry Quebert affair.</i>

00:48.659 --> 00:50.401
I lied to you

00:50.501 --> 00:51.603
when I told you that
I told my parents

00:51.703 --> 00:53.565
that I was staying
at Nancy's house.

00:53.665 --> 00:54.606
I didn't tell them anything.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.528
I just ran away.

00:56.628 --> 00:58.630
My mother told me
I had to be punished.

01:01.392 --> 01:02.554
[Marcus]: And so
what did you do with the paper?

01:02.634 --> 01:03.615
Did you tell anyone about it?

01:03.715 --> 01:04.656
[Tamara]: You bet I did.

01:04.756 --> 01:06.217
Chief Pratt.

01:06.317 --> 01:07.579
Don't worry.

01:07.679 --> 01:10.542
You'll see how we deal
with guys like that around here.

01:10.642 --> 01:12.644
Okay.

01:15.847 --> 01:17.108
<i>[Nancy]:</i>
<i>That's when she told me</i>

01:17.208 --> 01:18.630
<i>about her being in love</i>
<i>with an older man.</i>

01:18.730 --> 01:19.951
Didn't name names,

01:20.051 --> 01:21.753
but I was sure it was Stern.

01:21.853 --> 01:22.654
Did you ever
see them together?

01:22.734 --> 01:23.955
Nola and Stern?

01:24.055 --> 01:26.718
No. Like I told you,

01:26.818 --> 01:29.241
he'd just send that
deformed chauffeur of his.

01:29.341 --> 01:32.604
After she disappeared,
I told Chief Pratt everything.

01:32.704 --> 01:33.966
He promised he'd investigate.

01:34.066 --> 01:37.869
If I'd spoken up sooner,
she'd be alive today.

01:39.711 --> 01:42.914
[âªâªâªâªâª]

02:45.898 --> 02:47.640
[Marcus]: Look, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said anything.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.443
I just, I needed
to know the truth.

02:50.543 --> 02:52.886
You're not after the truth.

02:52.986 --> 02:55.368
Nah, you just...

02:55.468 --> 02:56.729
wanna prove
your hero's innocent,

02:56.829 --> 02:59.853
no matter who gets destroyed
in the process, huh?

02:59.953 --> 03:01.735
You want us to declare
Quebert a saint

03:01.835 --> 03:04.577
because maybe he didn't kill
the 15-year-old girl

03:04.677 --> 03:05.899
he was having an affair with?

03:05.999 --> 03:08.862
He was not having
an affair with her.

03:08.962 --> 03:10.784
You sure picked a hell of a guy
for a best friend.

03:10.884 --> 03:13.607
Only friend, actually.

03:19.773 --> 03:21.435
[Marcus]:
Tisha, thank you so much.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.797
The meal was, uh...
it was fantastic.

03:23.897 --> 03:25.839
[Tisha]: Well, I'm glad
you could join us, Marcus.

03:25.939 --> 03:26.760
[Marcus]: Me too.

03:26.860 --> 03:28.722
Why can't I read it?

03:28.822 --> 03:30.844
Maybe when
you're older.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.045
It's not really
meant for, um...

03:32.145 --> 03:33.847
Anyone.

03:33.947 --> 03:34.848
Don't listen to him.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.049
It's wonderful.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.771
Thank you.

03:37.871 --> 03:39.533
All right, girls.

03:39.633 --> 03:41.575
Let's do
the homework, okay?

03:41.675 --> 03:43.677
Let's do it,
both of you.

03:48.802 --> 03:50.744
So, I've been going through
that police report

03:50.844 --> 03:51.785
on Nola's
disappearance.

03:51.885 --> 03:52.666
Yeah.

03:52.766 --> 03:53.787
The one written
by Chief Pratt.

03:53.887 --> 03:55.709
No mention
of Stern or Harry.

03:55.809 --> 03:57.912
Really?

03:58.012 --> 03:59.073
Well, because
Nancy said

03:59.173 --> 04:00.754
that she told
Pratt about Stern

04:00.854 --> 04:01.796
after Nola
disappeared.

04:01.896 --> 04:02.877
Mm-hm.

04:02.977 --> 04:03.717
And then
Tamara Quinn

04:03.817 --> 04:04.839
said that
she showed him

04:04.939 --> 04:06.440
that incriminating paper

04:06.540 --> 04:08.963
she took from
Harry's house, so...

04:09.063 --> 04:09.804
And the report's signed

04:09.904 --> 04:11.906
by Pratt himself.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.849
With all
due respect, sir,

04:14.949 --> 04:17.892
Mrs. Quinn showed you
what Harry wrote about her.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.133
Nancy Hattaway told you

04:19.233 --> 04:20.855
about her relationship
with Stern,

04:20.955 --> 04:22.096
and yet nothing

04:22.196 --> 04:24.198
is mentioned in the case file.

04:24.839 --> 04:27.862
I combed the area for weeks

04:27.962 --> 04:30.465
looking for that girl,

04:30.565 --> 04:33.908
using every available resource,

04:34.008 --> 04:38.473
and you question my work?

04:38.573 --> 04:40.915
Cops don't do that
to other cops!

04:41.015 --> 04:43.137
The good ones do.

05:09.885 --> 05:11.226
All I ever wanted to be

05:11.326 --> 05:14.649
was a good cop...

05:15.891 --> 05:18.754
but sometimes...

05:18.854 --> 05:22.237
circumstances
beyond your control,

05:22.337 --> 05:24.840
they make you...

05:24.940 --> 05:27.803
do things.

05:27.903 --> 05:31.126
You keep it inside you
long enough,

05:31.226 --> 05:34.169
you get cancer.

05:34.269 --> 05:36.271
[knocking]

05:39.955 --> 05:44.700
She still thinks
I'm in remission.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.622
Why didn't you carry out
the investigation

05:46.722 --> 05:49.765
like you should've?

05:53.088 --> 05:55.911
What are you
hiding, Chief?

05:56.011 --> 05:58.013
Hmm?

06:03.099 --> 06:03.879
You can tell me here,

06:03.979 --> 06:05.962
or we can, uh...

06:06.062 --> 06:07.163
I can get a subpoena

06:07.263 --> 06:09.986
and force you to talk.

06:12.188 --> 06:14.811
No need.

06:14.911 --> 06:16.813
It's time.

06:16.913 --> 06:18.935
[sighing]

06:19.035 --> 06:23.319
I don't want to die
with this on my conscience.

06:29.085 --> 06:31.868
It was, uh...

06:31.968 --> 06:36.993
it was early August
when she came to see me.

06:37.093 --> 06:38.114

Well, hello, Nola.

06:45.782 --> 06:47.784
What's going on?

06:51.107 --> 06:52.008
Can I, uh...

06:52.108 --> 06:54.310
can I help you with something?

06:56.873 --> 06:58.875
Nola, do you--

06:59.316 --> 07:01.017
No, that's insane.
There's no way--

07:01.117 --> 07:02.739
It's the truth.

07:02.839 --> 07:03.900
I swear.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.343
That girl...

07:06.443 --> 07:09.846
knew exactly what she was doing.

07:11.448 --> 07:15.132
Now you're a criminal.

07:20.777 --> 07:23.340
You're the goddamn
chief of police.

07:26.103 --> 07:27.364
You couldn't resist the advances

07:27.464 --> 07:29.366
of a 15-year-old-girl?

07:29.466 --> 07:30.968
And...

07:31.068 --> 07:35.873
I take full
responsibility for that.

07:38.355 --> 07:41.659
And what happened the...

13:25.708 --> 13:26.609
Yeah, I know.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.370
I'm sorry, it's just, you know,

13:28.470 --> 13:30.473
I've been so busy
with the book and everything.

13:31.193 --> 13:32.455
I hope you're not mad at me

13:32.555 --> 13:33.315
for going to
the Summer Gala with Travis.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.497
No, no, no, no, no.

13:34.597 --> 13:35.778
Don't be silly. No.

13:35.878 --> 13:37.380
I don't love him,
you know.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.461
He's just a friend.

13:38.561 --> 13:39.382
Jenny...

13:39.482 --> 13:41.764
I love someone else.

13:44.447 --> 13:47.250
It's true. So...

13:53.496 --> 13:54.437
A little blush for you.

13:54.537 --> 13:56.439
Oh. Yeah.

13:56.539 --> 13:58.081
I... I gotta...

13:58.181 --> 13:59.322
Bye, Harry.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.424
I'll see you.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.427
Ooh...

14:10.513 --> 14:11.574
[Jenny screams]

14:11.674 --> 14:13.456
Oh! Oh, my...
Luther, you scared me! Geez!

14:13.556 --> 14:14.497
What does he want
from you?

14:14.597 --> 14:15.458
Ow! Nothing!

14:15.558 --> 14:16.379
What does he want
from you?

14:16.479 --> 14:17.380
Ow! He's a friend.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.341
You're hurting me!

14:18.441 --> 14:19.542
Geez! Ow!

14:19.642 --> 14:20.704
Have you thought
about my proposal?

14:20.804 --> 14:22.706
The answer is no!
Now, let go of me!

14:22.806 --> 14:23.667
Let go of me!

14:23.767 --> 14:26.169
Help! Help! Help!

14:29.933 --> 14:31.675
[car door opens
and closes]

14:31.775 --> 14:33.196
[engine starting]

14:33.296 --> 14:34.798
Ow...

14:34.898 --> 14:36.900
[car drives away]

15:06.330 --> 15:07.311
Hey.

15:07.411 --> 15:08.352
You need some help?

15:08.452 --> 15:09.433
Yeah.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.235
I think I overdid it.

15:11.335 --> 15:12.877
Here, you can get in.

15:12.977 --> 15:14.198
I'll take you home.

15:14.298 --> 15:16.160
Thanks.
Yeah, I think I...

15:16.260 --> 15:18.482
[wincing] Geez!

15:18.582 --> 15:19.323
I don't know,
I think I...

15:19.423 --> 15:22.266
I think I pulled
something.

15:24.949 --> 15:26.691
You're in Sommerdale

15:26.791 --> 15:28.532
awfully early
this morning.

15:28.632 --> 15:30.815
Mornings are my
favorite time of day.

15:30.915 --> 15:33.177
Mine too.

15:33.277 --> 15:35.279
It's usually when I get
my best writing done.

15:47.492 --> 15:48.553
Luther, thanks
for the ride.

15:48.653 --> 15:49.674
I appreciate it.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.776
I'm not sure I would've
made it without you.

16:03.628 --> 16:05.630
[âªâªâªâªâª]

16:21.726 --> 16:23.909
[parking brake engages]

16:24.009 --> 16:26.011
[door opens]

17:06.852 --> 17:09.455
Harry! I'm here!

17:13.539 --> 17:15.781
[typewriter clacking]

17:20.906 --> 17:21.847
I'll be right back.

17:21.947 --> 17:23.949
Okay.

17:37.043 --> 17:39.585
You're working
too hard, Quebert!

17:39.685 --> 17:41.507
Elijah Stern!

17:41.607 --> 17:43.790
What a surprise
to see you here.

17:43.890 --> 17:46.352
Elijah Stern!

17:46.452 --> 17:48.354
Come on up!

17:48.454 --> 17:49.596
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

17:49.696 --> 17:51.037
No, not at all!

17:51.137 --> 17:52.078
Good to see you.

17:52.178 --> 17:53.800
Good to see you too.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.562
So...

17:55.662 --> 17:57.844
you write and type
at the same time?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.727
Yes, I do one
and then I do the other.

18:00.827 --> 18:02.028
I've been working like this
for quite some time.

18:02.108 --> 18:02.809
Fascinating!

18:02.909 --> 18:03.730
Yes.

18:03.830 --> 18:06.813
The artist's process.

18:06.913 --> 18:08.455
I left my car in town,

18:08.555 --> 18:09.736
decided to take a walk,
and wound up here.

18:09.836 --> 18:10.777
Yeah?

18:10.877 --> 18:12.819
Old habits
die hard, I guess.

18:12.919 --> 18:15.382
Well, the view, it's just...

18:15.482 --> 18:16.543
it's so beautiful here.

18:16.643 --> 18:19.546
I can't
thank you enough.

18:19.646 --> 18:20.707
You could drive me
back into town,

18:20.807 --> 18:21.908
and I'll take you to lunch.

18:22.008 --> 18:22.989
It's a deal.

18:23.089 --> 18:24.151
No, no, no,
don't get up.

18:24.251 --> 18:26.253
Let me get my keys.
I'll be right back, okay?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.537
[door opens
and closes]

18:37.144 --> 18:39.146
[gasping]

18:45.672 --> 18:48.495
I forget how
beautiful it is here.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.617
Yes.

18:49.717 --> 18:51.819
I run this road
every morning.

18:51.919 --> 18:54.021
That's three miles
each way.

18:54.121 --> 18:55.703
You must be
a real athlete.

18:55.803 --> 18:56.864
I wouldn't say that.

18:56.964 --> 19:00.828
The other day, I'm heading back
from Sommerdale.

19:00.928 --> 19:02.430
I got a cramp in my leg.

19:02.530 --> 19:05.913
I didn't think I was gonna...
make it, but...

19:06.013 --> 19:08.436
um, your chauffeur picked me up

19:08.536 --> 19:10.678
and brought me
back to the house.

19:10.778 --> 19:12.440
Luther was here?
When was this?

19:12.540 --> 19:13.761
Uh...

19:13.861 --> 19:16.043
Day before yesterday,
before dawn.

19:16.143 --> 19:18.145
Ah, I see.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.051
Can I ask you
what happened to him?

19:24.151 --> 19:27.695
He... had an accident
a long time ago.

19:27.795 --> 19:29.737
He can seem a little
frightening sometimes,

19:29.837 --> 19:32.020
but actually,
he's a very kind

19:32.120 --> 19:34.182
and sensitive man.

19:34.282 --> 19:35.783
He's a great gardener.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.506
The plants are really thriving.

19:38.606 --> 19:39.787
Strange, though,
I never see him,

19:39.887 --> 19:40.708
and I'm always there.

19:40.808 --> 19:42.670
Luther is a...

19:42.770 --> 19:46.574
very discreet person.

19:54.102 --> 19:55.724
All right,

19:55.824 --> 19:58.727
turkey and Swiss
on wheat toast

19:58.827 --> 19:59.768
for Mr. Stern,

19:59.868 --> 20:01.810
and a short stack
with scrambled

20:01.910 --> 20:03.171
and a side
of hash browns,

20:03.271 --> 20:04.492
crispy,

20:04.592 --> 20:07.215
just the way you
like them, Harry.

20:07.315 --> 20:09.317
Thanks, Jenny.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.063
So, how's the book going?

20:15.163 --> 20:16.825
Very well,
very well.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.867
Uh... thanks to the house.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.148
I find I'm...

20:20.248 --> 20:21.950
very inspired, working here.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.992
Probably inspired

20:24.092 --> 20:27.035
by that girl you're seeing
more than anything.

20:27.135 --> 20:29.117
I'm not judging.

20:29.217 --> 20:30.759
She's a good-looking girl.

20:30.859 --> 20:31.920
A little young, maybe,

20:32.020 --> 20:35.564
but she's certainly
having sex with one of us.

20:35.664 --> 20:37.766
And I know
it's not me.

20:37.866 --> 20:39.868
Jenny?

20:41.830 --> 20:42.651
No.

20:42.751 --> 20:45.174
She's lovely.

20:45.274 --> 20:47.776
We flirt a bit, but...
[clears throat]

20:47.876 --> 20:50.820
you know, I'm... looking
for somebody special.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.221
Different.

20:52.321 --> 20:55.264
We all have those desires
for someone special, don't we?

20:55.364 --> 20:58.087
I do hope
you find yours, Harry.

21:17.146 --> 21:18.688
Hi, Nola!

21:18.788 --> 21:19.889
Need a lift?

21:19.989 --> 21:21.931
No, thanks.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.613
It's just
down the road.

21:23.713 --> 21:25.715
Get in.

21:51.020 --> 21:53.023
Where are you taking me?

21:55.945 --> 21:57.687
I'll tell everyone.

21:57.787 --> 21:59.249
You've already
made me a criminal.

21:59.349 --> 22:02.032
I got nothing to lose.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.716
[turns off engine]

22:12.963 --> 22:13.884
Glad I could be
of service, Miss Kellergan!

22:13.964 --> 22:15.966
You have a nice day, now!

22:21.932 --> 22:23.934
[tires squeal]

22:37.307 --> 22:39.970
[Nola's mother]:
You know why I'm doing this?

22:40.070 --> 22:42.173
[Nola]: Yes, Mother.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.855
I'm sorry, I'm a wicked girl.

22:44.955 --> 22:46.937
[Nola's mother]:
You're not wicked.

22:47.037 --> 22:48.018
Penance is a blessing.

22:48.118 --> 22:51.902
[blows thud, Nola screams]

22:52.002 --> 22:54.245
[Nola screaming]

22:56.247 --> 22:58.950
[screaming]

22:59.050 --> 23:00.751
You will treat me with respect!

23:00.851 --> 23:03.234
[blows landing, screaming]

23:03.334 --> 23:05.977
[turns music up loud]

23:09.020 --> 23:10.762
[voices scream from inside]
Take it off!

23:10.862 --> 23:13.284
[Nola screaming] No!
I don't want to take it off!

23:13.384 --> 23:15.807
[music blasting]

23:15.907 --> 23:17.909
[Nola screaming]

23:30.161 --> 23:32.183
[Harry, gently]
It's called abuse, Nola.

23:32.283 --> 23:34.986
Your father is
no better if he just...

23:35.086 --> 23:36.027
he stands by,

23:36.127 --> 23:40.071
and he just lets
your mom torture you.

23:40.171 --> 23:41.873
I'm gonna
go over there.

23:41.973 --> 23:43.755
No.

23:43.855 --> 23:46.037
That would be the end of us.

23:46.137 --> 23:47.198
If you really
wanna help me,

23:47.298 --> 23:49.961
you'd take me
away from here.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.164
We could go at the end
of this month, the 30th.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.966
That would give us at least
two weeks to get ready.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.048
I know, it's just...
it's too soon.

23:57.148 --> 23:59.151
It just...

23:59.991 --> 24:02.094
Well, I'm going
regardless.

24:02.194 --> 24:03.415
-No...
-Yes, I am.

24:03.515 --> 24:05.877
-No--
-Yes, I am!

24:08.360 --> 24:11.283
And I want you
to come with me.

24:15.207 --> 24:16.308
We can be in Canada
in three hours,

24:16.408 --> 24:19.211
and no one will ever find us.

24:31.023 --> 24:33.145
We'd be so happy there.

24:47.039 --> 24:49.822
Okay...

24:49.922 --> 24:50.543
Hiya, Jenny.

24:50.643 --> 24:52.305
Is everything okay?

24:52.405 --> 24:54.227
Haven't had a chance
to talk, uh...

24:54.327 --> 24:55.228
since the Gala.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.229
Had a great time.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.070
You seemed a little distant.

24:58.170 --> 25:00.933
Just wondering
if anything is wrong...

25:07.300 --> 25:09.302
Okay.

25:11.104 --> 25:13.106
[turning engine off]

25:14.027 --> 25:14.968
[âªâªâªâªâª]

25:15.068 --> 25:18.131
[door opens]

25:18.231 --> 25:19.092
Hiya, Jenny.

25:19.192 --> 25:20.213
Hi, Travis.

25:20.313 --> 25:21.534
How's everything going?

25:21.634 --> 25:23.056
Good.

25:23.156 --> 25:24.177
Haven't had much
of a chance to talk

25:24.277 --> 25:25.979
since the Gala.

25:26.079 --> 25:28.461
Great time. Right?

25:28.561 --> 25:32.065
Yeah. Yeah,
it was really nice.

25:32.165 --> 25:33.266
So, um...

25:33.366 --> 25:35.548
I've noticed that
you've seemed a little...

25:35.648 --> 25:37.591
distant lately.

25:37.691 --> 25:39.953
Is anything wrong?

25:40.053 --> 25:42.115
Oh, Travis, it's...
it really...

25:42.215 --> 25:44.077
it really has nothing
to do with you.

25:44.177 --> 25:46.980
I actually have to
finish clearing now.

25:48.101 --> 25:49.002
Wait, Jenny,
I just want--

25:49.102 --> 25:49.883
[wincing]

25:49.983 --> 25:50.604
Sorry, sorry, I...

25:50.704 --> 25:52.706
Sorry, I...

25:54.067 --> 25:55.208
What is this?

25:55.308 --> 25:56.450
I just... I banged
it on the door.

25:56.550 --> 25:58.091
Just clumsy.

25:58.191 --> 26:00.334
Did somebody
do that, Jenny?

26:00.434 --> 26:02.216
Just forget about it,
Travis, okay?

26:02.316 --> 26:03.056
No, no, no,

26:03.156 --> 26:05.219
I'm not leaving
until you tell me.

26:05.319 --> 26:07.601
Jenny, you can trust me.

26:11.325 --> 26:13.327
Um...

26:14.488 --> 26:17.031
You know Luther Caleb?

26:17.131 --> 26:19.273
Stern's chauffeur?

26:19.373 --> 26:22.136
He got angry,
and he grabbed my arm.

26:24.138 --> 26:27.121
Angry about what?

26:27.221 --> 26:29.924
Um...

26:30.024 --> 26:32.326
he wanted me
to pose for him, is all.

26:32.426 --> 26:36.170
It's... silly.

26:36.270 --> 26:38.452
What does that
mean, "pose"?

26:38.552 --> 26:41.215
Oh, he's an artist, I guess,
so he, um...

26:41.315 --> 26:43.177
I said no. I...

26:43.277 --> 26:48.522
Anyway, he got a little
out of control, and, um...

26:50.685 --> 26:52.146
He didn't mean
anything by it.

26:52.246 --> 26:54.148
Really, it was...

26:54.248 --> 26:56.471
it was just a misunderstanding.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.032
Travis, I...

26:58.132 --> 27:00.134
Mom's gonna kill me.
I've gotta go.

27:10.465 --> 27:12.467
[door closes]

27:23.438 --> 27:25.260
Harry!

27:25.360 --> 27:27.362
I'm here!

27:29.444 --> 27:31.526
Harry?

27:32.687 --> 27:34.689
I'll be outside.

27:57.793 --> 27:59.795
Harry?

28:00.315 --> 28:02.437
Harry!

28:11.166 --> 28:13.168
Harry!

28:15.210 --> 28:17.212
Harry!

28:20.296 --> 28:21.157
I've been
calling you

28:21.257 --> 28:22.278
for the last
10 minutes.

28:22.378 --> 28:24.500
Sorry.

28:26.462 --> 28:28.464
Are those the new pages?

28:29.545 --> 28:30.406
I can type them up.

28:30.506 --> 28:33.449
No, not yet.

28:33.549 --> 28:35.551
They're not ready yet.

28:39.315 --> 28:41.417
Are you okay?

28:41.517 --> 28:43.379
Yeah, never better.

28:43.479 --> 28:46.162
I think I need
a swim, though.

28:50.246 --> 28:52.148
What?

28:52.248 --> 28:54.310
You just seem
a bit different.

28:54.410 --> 28:56.352
I just need a swim.

28:56.452 --> 28:58.454
Okay.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.365
That will be us in 10 days...

29:09.465 --> 29:11.828
flying away free.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.539
[Harry, barely audible]
You're gonna meet me

29:22.639 --> 29:25.382
at the... hotel?

29:25.482 --> 29:26.263
What room?

29:26.363 --> 29:27.304
[Nola]: Eight.

29:27.404 --> 29:28.545
[Harry]: Yes.

29:28.645 --> 29:30.267
You want to go?

29:30.367 --> 29:32.369
[Nola]: All right.

29:56.433 --> 29:58.455
[siren wailing]
<i>Pull over!</i>

29:58.555 --> 29:59.897
<i>Pull over immediately!</i>

29:59.997 --> 30:01.999
[siren wailing]

30:16.413 --> 30:18.415
Out of your vehicle, please?

30:20.498 --> 30:21.639
Was I speeding,
Travis?

30:21.739 --> 30:23.741
Now, you goddamn retard!

30:24.702 --> 30:26.704
[grunting and struggling]

30:28.626 --> 30:29.427
What have you been
doing to Jenny, huh?

30:29.507 --> 30:30.728
[slamming onto the hood]

30:30.828 --> 30:32.410
I saw the bruises on her arm.

30:32.510 --> 30:33.891
I don't want any trouble
with the police.

30:33.991 --> 30:35.993
I didn't mean to
hurt her, I swear.

30:37.315 --> 30:38.776
You're in love with her,
aren't you?

30:38.876 --> 30:40.658
What do you do,
you paint her first,

30:40.758 --> 30:41.819
you fuck her after?

30:41.919 --> 30:43.501
-No, no!
[blows landing]

30:43.601 --> 30:44.442
You think she's gonna
let you do it?

30:44.522 --> 30:45.863
Out of pity? Never!

30:45.963 --> 30:46.824
No, it's not
what you think--

30:46.924 --> 30:48.786
You hear me?

30:48.886 --> 30:51.249
[breathing heavily]

30:58.736 --> 31:02.480
I don't wanna see you
around Clark's again.

31:02.580 --> 31:04.582
You understand?

31:07.025 --> 31:08.366
I said do you
understand?

31:08.466 --> 31:09.567
Yes.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.669
Okay.

31:13.471 --> 31:16.274
[groaning]

31:21.840 --> 31:24.783
<i>[Marcus]: Yeah,</i>
<i>it's done, I sent it.</i>

31:24.883 --> 31:27.426
It's the first 50 pages.
You know, it's rough.

31:27.526 --> 31:28.867
You know, it's just...
notes, really.

31:28.967 --> 31:30.148
<i>He's gonna love 'em.</i>

31:30.248 --> 31:31.990
I mean, this case is
all anyone's talking about.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.952
Hollywood's already
fighting for the rights.

31:34.052 --> 31:34.813
<i>Yeah, I'm just trying</i>
<i>to tell the truth, Doug.</i>

31:34.893 --> 31:36.475
Yeah, and you should,

31:36.575 --> 31:38.517
<i>but you just gotta be careful</i>
<i>about all this libel shit.</i>

31:38.617 --> 31:39.398
What do you mean?

31:39.498 --> 31:40.879
<i>Well, like, Nola's mother.</i>

31:40.979 --> 31:41.940
<i>You can't just write</i>
<i>that she beat her daughter</i>

31:42.020 --> 31:43.762
without any concrete proof.

31:43.862 --> 31:44.963
I mean, you just write

31:45.063 --> 31:48.767
that she was... unhappy
and mistreated.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.409
But Pratt, he confessed,

31:50.509 --> 31:52.491
so go ahead, give us
all those sordid, juicy details

31:52.591 --> 31:54.573
about how she went down on him,

31:54.673 --> 31:57.496
and then he forced her
to go down on him again--

31:57.596 --> 31:59.979
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got it, I got it.

32:00.079 --> 32:01.300
<i>I gotta go.</i>

32:01.400 --> 32:02.621
<i>Thanks for the...</i>
<i>spiritual guidance.</i>

32:02.721 --> 32:04.723
Yeah.

32:09.008 --> 32:10.469
Say what you will,

32:10.569 --> 32:12.311
I intend to handle
this alone.

32:12.411 --> 32:14.433
Elijah,
don't be a fool.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.676
[knocks on door]

32:16.776 --> 32:17.877
Listen...

32:17.977 --> 32:18.918
no one speaks
to the police

32:19.018 --> 32:20.039
without a lawyer.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.141
I do.

32:23.582 --> 32:24.564
[Perry]: Thank you
for coming.

32:24.664 --> 32:25.845
I'm Sergeant Gahalowood.

32:25.945 --> 32:26.726
Mm-hm.

32:26.826 --> 32:27.727
Please.

32:27.827 --> 32:29.569
I prefer to stand.

32:29.669 --> 32:31.671
Okay.

32:32.552 --> 32:34.053
Let's get to it.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.615
Mr. Stern, can you tell me

32:35.715 --> 32:37.417
why a portrait
of a murdered girl

32:37.517 --> 32:39.519
was in your house?

32:42.682 --> 32:45.585
Because I own it.

32:45.685 --> 32:48.508
I also own a portrait
of John Lennon.

32:48.608 --> 32:51.851
Am I suspect
in his murder too?

32:56.936 --> 32:58.358
My former chauffeur,

32:58.458 --> 32:59.919
Luther Caleb,
painted it.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.921
One of many
he did for me.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.563
Mostly landscapes.

33:03.663 --> 33:05.665
And do you know
why he painted it?

33:06.626 --> 33:08.368
He loved painting,

33:08.468 --> 33:11.431
and he was good at it.

33:12.953 --> 33:14.955
Okay.

33:16.957 --> 33:18.959
And how did it come
to be painted?

33:19.920 --> 33:22.582
With a paintbrush.

33:22.682 --> 33:23.543
[sighs]

33:23.643 --> 33:25.065
Did you know Nola?

33:25.165 --> 33:28.428
Everyone in Sommerdale
knew Nola.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.030
All right.

33:30.130 --> 33:31.952
Well, I have witnesses
who will testify

33:32.052 --> 33:34.795
that you two were actually
in a relationship,

33:34.895 --> 33:36.076
and that, uh...

33:36.176 --> 33:38.719
you often brought her
to your house.

33:38.819 --> 33:40.521
[chuckles]

33:40.621 --> 33:43.644
Sergeant, Nola
came to my door one day

33:43.744 --> 33:45.746
and said she needed money...

33:47.868 --> 33:51.932
and agreed to pose
for the painting in exchange.

33:52.032 --> 33:53.534
Hmm.

33:53.634 --> 33:54.935
And you...

33:55.035 --> 33:56.457
didn't see any problem

33:56.557 --> 33:58.879
with a 15-year-old
posing naked?

34:00.801 --> 34:04.425
There is nothing prurient
about that painting, Sergeant.

34:04.525 --> 34:06.527
It's a work of fine art.

34:14.695 --> 34:16.637
That guy had
a huge pair of cojones.

34:16.737 --> 34:18.880
Yeah, but it doesn't
add up.

34:18.980 --> 34:19.760
It doesn't add up.

34:19.860 --> 34:21.642
Why would Nola
need money?

34:21.742 --> 34:23.604
What, to run away
with Harry?

34:23.704 --> 34:24.645
But then her father said

34:24.745 --> 34:25.666
that she didn't take
her savings with her

34:25.746 --> 34:27.168
when she left, so...

34:27.268 --> 34:29.650
It makes no sense.

34:29.750 --> 34:31.092
Yeah.

34:31.192 --> 34:32.493
What'd you do with
the painting, anyway?

34:32.593 --> 34:33.655
You give back?

34:33.755 --> 34:34.696
Uh, no.

34:34.796 --> 34:35.697
We're gonna
hold onto it

34:35.797 --> 34:36.978
as evidence
against Caleb.

34:37.078 --> 34:38.059
Caleb?

34:38.159 --> 34:39.741
Why?

34:39.841 --> 34:41.703
Don't know yet.

34:41.803 --> 34:43.104
Stern wanted
the painting of her.

34:43.204 --> 34:45.627
Pratt wanted
sexual favors.

34:45.727 --> 34:47.509
What motive
did they have?

34:47.609 --> 34:49.150
Well, they were afraid
she'd talk, obviously.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.392
I mean, look,

34:50.492 --> 34:52.914
she could've threatened
to expose them, right,

34:53.014 --> 34:54.676
and then in a moment
of panic--

34:54.776 --> 34:55.797
You don't write
"Goodbye, darling Nola"

34:55.897 --> 34:57.679
in a moment of panic.

34:57.779 --> 35:01.162
This is someone
who loved her, all right?

35:01.262 --> 35:04.586
I mean, everything
points to Quebert.

35:06.748 --> 35:08.750
[sighing]

35:12.073 --> 35:13.215
Look, Marcus,

35:13.315 --> 35:15.817
I gotta
tell you something.

35:15.917 --> 35:18.620
The DA's gonna
offer Harry a deal.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.901
If he pleads guilty
to a crime of passion,

35:20.001 --> 35:22.945
they'll drop
the kidnapping charge.

35:23.045 --> 35:26.288
15 years, out in 10.

35:31.733 --> 35:34.576
[âªâªâªâªâª]

36:09.211 --> 36:10.192
Please don't tell me

36:10.292 --> 36:12.034
you're going to
accept that deal.

36:12.134 --> 36:13.596
It is the best way for me

36:13.696 --> 36:15.918
to avoid spending
the rest of my life in prison.

36:16.018 --> 36:17.019
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

36:17.099 --> 36:19.322
That you're guilty?

36:19.422 --> 36:21.284
Does it matter?

36:21.384 --> 36:24.767
It seems like everything
condemns me anyway,

36:24.867 --> 36:27.930
and I don't wanna
play poker with a...

36:28.030 --> 36:31.054
jury that has already
convicted me.

36:31.154 --> 36:32.735
Harry, did you kill
Nola Kellergan?

36:32.835 --> 36:34.337
-No.
-Okay.

36:34.437 --> 36:35.278
When are you gonna
stop asking me that?

36:35.358 --> 36:37.220
Okay, then
let's prove it.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.181
All right?

36:38.281 --> 36:40.143
Now, correct me
if I'm wrong, but...

36:40.243 --> 36:41.865
at the time that you
two were gonna leave,

36:41.965 --> 36:43.787
your book was
practically done, right?

36:43.887 --> 36:47.210
I don't want you
to record this anymore.

36:48.892 --> 36:51.074
Shut it off.

36:51.174 --> 36:53.176
[clicks recorder]

36:56.019 --> 36:58.982
What was your question?

37:01.825 --> 37:02.846
August 30th.

37:02.946 --> 37:05.689
At the time you two were
planning on leaving,

37:05.789 --> 37:07.851
your book was
practically done, right?

37:07.951 --> 37:09.333
I finished it almost, uh...

37:09.433 --> 37:12.175
three days before
we were going to leave.

37:12.275 --> 37:14.277
Okay.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.342
I wrote it so fast,

37:18.442 --> 37:21.225
it was amazing.

37:21.325 --> 37:24.108
It was like I was in a trance.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.311
Nola was there, she was...

37:27.411 --> 37:30.814
proofing, editing, typing...

37:32.776 --> 37:35.219
It was magical.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.923
August 27th,

37:39.023 --> 37:40.764
I'll never forget that day.

37:40.864 --> 37:43.407
The manuscripts,

37:43.507 --> 37:47.932
there were two of them
stacked on the table,

37:48.032 --> 37:49.974
the handwritten one,

37:50.074 --> 37:53.818
and the one that she'd typed.

37:53.918 --> 37:57.141
Afterward,
we went down to the beach,

37:57.241 --> 38:00.765
to the spot where we met
the first time...

38:03.047 --> 38:04.308
<i>She said that</i>

38:04.408 --> 38:08.272
<i>meeting me had</i>
<i>changed her life forever.</i>

38:08.372 --> 38:10.074
<i>We went over our plan,</i>

38:10.174 --> 38:11.596
<i>that I'd be leaving</i>
<i>the next morning,</i>

38:11.696 --> 38:14.759
<i>stopping by Clark's</i>
<i>so that people would see me,</i>

38:14.859 --> 38:16.841
<i>and I could tell them that</i>
<i>I'd be away for a week or two</i>

38:16.941 --> 38:18.963
<i>for business in Boston.</i>

38:19.063 --> 38:21.205
<i>Then, on August 30th,</i>

38:21.305 --> 38:24.008
<i>I would wait for her</i>
<i>at the By the Sea Motel,</i>

38:24.108 --> 38:27.172
<i>Room 8, at 8:00 p.m.</i>

38:27.272 --> 38:29.974
<i>We'd cross the border</i>
<i>into Canada,</i>

38:30.074 --> 38:31.976
<i>find a small apartment to rent,</i>

38:32.076 --> 38:34.018
<i>then I'd return to Goose Cove</i>
<i>a few days later,</i>

38:34.118 --> 38:38.063
<i>give the keys back,</i>
<i>and leave Sommerdale for good,</i>

38:38.163 --> 38:39.464
<i>explaining that</i>
<i>my novel was finished,</i>

38:39.564 --> 38:41.106
<i>and I'd have to go</i>
<i>back to New York</i>

38:41.206 --> 38:45.830
<i>to deal with its publication.</i>

38:45.930 --> 38:46.971
She was looking forward
to getting married

38:47.052 --> 38:49.254
when she turned 18...

38:50.535 --> 38:52.878
Publish the book.

38:52.978 --> 38:54.840
I would become a professor.

38:54.940 --> 38:58.804
We'd get a dog.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.768
I'd never been so happy
in my entire life...

39:02.868 --> 39:06.071
so convinced that this was
the right thing to do.

39:07.953 --> 39:11.857
I remember falling asleep.

39:11.957 --> 39:14.339
I was so relaxed.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.441
[âªâªâªâªâª]

39:35.140 --> 39:38.124
[whispering]
You're gonna be a great writer

39:38.224 --> 39:41.046
and a university professor,

39:41.146 --> 39:44.530
and we're gonna get
a big, sun-colored dog.

39:44.630 --> 39:48.114
A Labrador we'll name Storm.

39:49.995 --> 39:51.997
[âªâªâªâªâª]

40:12.458 --> 40:15.001
I woke up.

40:15.101 --> 40:19.846
The sun was... setting.

40:19.946 --> 40:24.971
There was only one manuscript
on the table now.

40:25.071 --> 40:27.213
The handwritten one.

40:27.313 --> 40:30.937
She had taken the typed one...

40:31.037 --> 40:33.920
to proofread.

40:45.131 --> 40:48.335
That was the last time
I saw her.

40:50.497 --> 40:53.380
[âªâªâªâªâª]

41:09.236 --> 41:11.058
[cork pops]

41:11.158 --> 41:12.539
They're notes, Roy, okay?

41:12.639 --> 41:14.021
Don't get too excited.

41:14.121 --> 41:15.502
It's not even close
to being ready for publication.

41:15.602 --> 41:17.224
I know, I know.

41:17.324 --> 41:19.106
It's just a work in progress.

41:19.206 --> 41:21.028
Cheers, my friend.

41:21.128 --> 41:23.130
[glasses clink]

41:24.371 --> 41:25.993
Can I get a little autograph
from you over there, pal?

41:26.093 --> 41:28.155
Please?

41:28.255 --> 41:29.557
Anyway...

41:29.657 --> 41:31.479
Delivery, end of August.

41:31.579 --> 41:33.040
Um...

41:33.140 --> 41:35.122
publication the last week
of September.

41:35.222 --> 41:37.164
That is prior to the election,

41:37.264 --> 41:38.205
and during the Quebert trial.

41:38.305 --> 41:40.047
I am telling you,

41:40.147 --> 41:43.170
the marketing gods
are smiling down on us.

41:43.270 --> 41:44.332
Yeah, well,
what if the investigation

41:44.432 --> 41:45.573
is still ongoing?

41:45.673 --> 41:46.974
I mean, how am I
supposed to...

41:47.074 --> 41:47.955
how am I supposed
to finish the book?

41:48.035 --> 41:49.297
Well, if the investigation
is over,

41:49.397 --> 41:50.378
that means it's a true story.

41:50.478 --> 41:51.699
Uh-huh.

41:51.799 --> 41:54.061
But if it's still ongoing,
that's even better,

41:54.161 --> 41:56.544
and let me explain why,
my rich friend.

41:56.644 --> 41:57.625
Because then,

41:57.725 --> 41:59.707
we will have to print
a revised edition

41:59.807 --> 42:01.189
with all new details,

42:01.289 --> 42:02.250
and people have to buy
the frickin' thing

42:02.330 --> 42:04.112
all over again, right?

42:04.212 --> 42:05.353
More manna from the gods.

42:05.453 --> 42:08.396
So let's not
incur their wrath.

42:08.496 --> 42:09.557
Let's just
sign the thing

42:09.657 --> 42:12.180
and say "thank you."

42:15.503 --> 42:16.604
[sighs with satisfaction]

42:16.704 --> 42:18.166
Pleasure doing business
with you, my friend.

42:18.266 --> 42:19.087
[phone rings]

42:19.187 --> 42:20.048
Always.

42:20.148 --> 42:20.729
What?

42:20.829 --> 42:21.730
<i>Barry for you.</i>

42:21.830 --> 42:23.411
Return.

42:23.511 --> 42:25.293
Warner Brothers.

42:25.393 --> 42:27.335
They wanna talk
about Tom Cruise.

42:27.435 --> 42:28.416
I think he's too old
to play you.

42:28.516 --> 42:29.257
What do you think?

42:29.357 --> 42:31.539
Yeah...

42:31.639 --> 42:34.002
See if Johnny Depp's available.

42:36.204 --> 42:38.607
Johnny Depp...

42:40.208 --> 42:41.169
<i>[Assistant Director calls]:</i>
<i>Benjamin Roth,</i>

42:41.249 --> 42:43.432
<i>we're on in three minutes!</i>

42:43.532 --> 42:45.073
[cell phone rings]

42:45.173 --> 42:46.555
Hey, can I call you right back?

42:46.655 --> 42:47.676
<i>I'm almost</i>
<i>at the house.</i>

42:47.776 --> 42:49.398
The-the-the results
are in, Goldman.

42:49.498 --> 42:51.560
<i>The handwriting isn't Harry's.</i>

42:51.660 --> 42:53.242
He didn't write the note
on that goddamn manuscript!

42:53.342 --> 42:54.403
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>wait, okay,</i>

42:54.503 --> 42:56.044
what does...
what does that mean,

42:56.144 --> 42:57.446
in concrete terms?

42:57.546 --> 42:59.568
Well, it undermines
the state's case against Harry.

42:59.668 --> 43:01.330
<i>I mean, that was their main</i>
<i>piece of evidence.</i>

43:01.430 --> 43:02.451
Holy shit.

43:02.551 --> 43:05.254
The judge has ordered
a new hearing

43:05.354 --> 43:07.696
this Thursday at 2:00.

43:07.796 --> 43:09.098
<i>I can't</i>
<i>believe this!</i>

43:09.198 --> 43:11.220
Oh, don't thank me, Goldman.

43:11.320 --> 43:14.343
<i>I'm just a humble servant</i>
<i>of the law...</i>

43:14.443 --> 43:15.704
whose billable hours
just tripled.

43:15.804 --> 43:17.386
[laughs]

43:17.486 --> 43:18.467
Ciao!

43:18.567 --> 43:21.230
[birdsong echoes in trees]

43:21.330 --> 43:23.572
[âªâªâªâªâª]

43:31.740 --> 43:34.543
[âªâªâªâªâª]

43:42.431 --> 43:44.433
[sighing]

43:48.317 --> 43:50.319
[cell phone rings]

43:54.804 --> 43:56.806
Don't you ever sleep?

43:57.326 --> 44:00.450
I have some
devastating news.

44:01.811 --> 44:03.072
I've been hacked.

44:03.172 --> 44:06.156
<i>Those 50 pages of notes</i>
<i>you emailed me...</i>

44:06.256 --> 44:07.517
leaked.

44:07.617 --> 44:09.599
Every major news outlet
in the country.

44:09.699 --> 44:11.761
R... Roy... Roy...
you have to stop them.

44:11.861 --> 44:13.563
<i>They weren't</i>
<i>for publication, Roy.</i>

44:13.663 --> 44:16.126
<i>They're intimate details</i>
<i>about these people.</i>

44:16.226 --> 44:17.447
<i>People who trusted me.</i>

44:17.547 --> 44:19.649
<i>It could seriously</i>
<i>impede the investigation.</i>

44:19.749 --> 44:21.211
It's too late.

44:21.311 --> 44:22.252
My phone is ringing
off the hook.

44:22.352 --> 44:24.254
Everybody from the Times to ET.

44:24.354 --> 44:28.738
They all want some...
juicy tidbit they can print.

44:28.838 --> 44:30.660
<i>By tomorrow,</i>

44:30.760 --> 44:34.444
<i>this will be all</i>
<i>anybody's talking about.</i>

44:36.566 --> 44:38.568
Shit.

44:51.822 --> 44:55.505
[âªâªâªâªâª]
