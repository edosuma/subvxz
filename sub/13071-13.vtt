00:05.273 --> 00:11.645
* Once the end was coming,
now at last the end is here *

00:11.679 --> 00:13.647
* Ella's dead,
but at least there's not *

00:13.681 --> 00:15.483
* A space bug in her ear

00:15.516 --> 00:17.651
* Looks like Red
is finally feeling better *

00:17.685 --> 00:20.020
* Luke's all fired up
and lean and mean *

00:29.697 --> 00:32.800
* Gareth's glad that Laurel said
she'll stay and see it through *

00:32.833 --> 00:36.237
* She tells Rochelle and Gustav
that she knows just what to do *

00:36.270 --> 00:38.206
* While they scheme
the clock is ticking *

00:38.239 --> 00:39.807
* Here in
this fair brownstone *

00:39.840 --> 00:42.710
* Where we lay our scene.

LAUREL:
I know what their plan is,

00:47.115 --> 00:49.483
and I think I know
how to stop it.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.185
(guitar continues playing
in distance)

00:51.219 --> 00:53.554
Okay.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.823
38 days. Their countdown
clock said 38 days.

00:55.856 --> 00:59.193
I knew it sounded familiar.
War. 38 days to start war.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.662
No, the war was a distraction.
The internment camps were

01:01.695 --> 01:03.564
a distraction--
they were never for internment.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.633
They were hothouses.
A distraction from what?

01:05.666 --> 01:07.801
Shh!

01:07.835 --> 01:10.104
(guitar continues playing)

01:12.540 --> 01:13.741
(sighs):
Tsk. Oh, God.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.176
(knocks)

01:19.313 --> 01:20.648
ROCHELLE:
A distraction...

01:20.681 --> 01:21.782
from what?

01:21.815 --> 01:23.684
Cherry blossoms.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.786
Global warming has extended
the cherry blossom season,

01:25.819 --> 01:26.754
but it's ending.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.189
In 38 days.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.757
Right. Well, less now.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.692
(exhales)
They need the cherry blossoms.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.794
That's where they spawn.
That's why the hothouses.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.364
It's not just about spreading
the blossoms to other states,

01:36.397 --> 01:38.766
it's about surviving here, now.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.435
So what do we do?
We stop the building
of this hothouse.

01:41.469 --> 01:45.639
The one in Manassas.
No, no, no, no.
It's almost done.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.841
We need to sabotage it.
How?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.910
We need full blueprints.
Can you get them

01:49.943 --> 01:51.679
from Red?
I'll talk to Gareth.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.914
And what about the vote
on the other hothouses?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.650
We still need to stop them.
Right. My brother's on it.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.119
Nice. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

02:00.388 --> 02:03.291
I feel like we should
say something to each other.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.292
*

02:04.325 --> 02:05.859
(giggles)

02:05.893 --> 02:07.461
We're in this together.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.597
It's us against the world.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.865
The world won't know
what hit it.

02:11.899 --> 02:12.766
Ow.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.402
Sorry about that.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.939
Well!

02:18.972 --> 02:22.443
Look who's here.
This is your son's
girlfriend, Lana.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.577
Laurel.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.880
Mr. and Mrs. Ritter, hi.
Oh, call us Nora and Sam. I...

02:26.914 --> 02:28.749
SAM: Hi.
NORA: Gareth didn't tell us

02:28.782 --> 02:30.384
he had a girlfriend.
RED: Yeah. they're in town

02:30.418 --> 02:31.452
because of this
terrible mugging.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.721
It's the Democrats--
coddling

02:33.754 --> 02:35.523
inner-city terrorists.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.824
Uh, sorry.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
Didn't mean
to offend you.
SAM: Oh!

02:38.892 --> 02:40.861
You're a... Democrat.
Sam.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.831
What? I-I didn't say anything...
Not ju a Democrat.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.733
Her brother's the leader
of the rebellion

02:45.766 --> 02:48.736
in the senate.
He's your brother?

02:48.769 --> 02:49.937
Would you do me a favor
and get Senator...

02:50.971 --> 02:52.706
There he is!

02:52.740 --> 02:54.242
Hey, man of the hour.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.609
We were just
talking politics.

02:55.643 --> 02:58.646
(awkward chuckle)

02:58.679 --> 02:59.647
NORA:
Gareth. Oh!

02:59.680 --> 03:01.815
(grunts)
Oh! Sorry.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.684
How are you doing?
Good, Mom.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.919
You guys didn't need
to come this far.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.821
You got stabbed!
Of course we'd come.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.324
Hi.

03:10.358 --> 03:13.327
Hi.
RED: We were just
discussing you two.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.628
You're a sly one, eh?

03:14.662 --> 03:17.565
Not telling your parents
you're dating a Democrat?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.633
Especially so soon
after she...

03:19.667 --> 03:23.237
dated Michael Moore.
What?

03:23.271 --> 03:25.806
Gareth. Do you have a minute?
(quietly): Sure.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.641
(door closes)

03:27.675 --> 03:29.243
Well, that was weird.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.545
Yes. It was.
Yep.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.514
I need the blueprints
for the hothouses.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.815
What?

03:34.848 --> 03:36.384
You have them.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.752
No, the full things.
Can you get them?

03:38.786 --> 03:41.389
I can try. Are...

03:41.422 --> 03:43.657
are you good?

03:43.691 --> 03:45.659
Yeah. Yeah.
What do you mean?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.762
Just, my parents, and...
I don't know what they
were saying, and...

03:48.796 --> 03:51.799
they're kind of old-fashioned,
and Red's kind of been a...

04:00.908 --> 04:02.976
We could do it right here.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.680
With your parents on the
other side of the wall?

04:06.714 --> 04:08.349
I have a lock.
(chuckles)

04:08.382 --> 04:09.950
Well, in that case.

04:09.983 --> 04:10.984
Mm-hmm.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.820
*

04:18.392 --> 04:19.727
I have to go.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.762
I know.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.998
Where is everybody?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.300
Back in their offices.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.502
They got tired.
What can we do?

04:28.536 --> 04:30.638
We need to stop these
hothouses from being built.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.906
Well... I'm open to ideas.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.009
What would bring
the senators back?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.346
Drama.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.013
And what drama
might that be?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.383
(sighs)

04:42.416 --> 04:43.884
You have a thought?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.386
Eh, not a good one.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.888
I'm open to bad ones.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.801
Want to do me a favor?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.870
That... depends.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.805
Arrest me.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.608
(scoffs, laughs)

05:07.641 --> 05:11.445
(both laughing)

05:11.479 --> 05:13.481
Oh... seriously.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.116
And why would I do that?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.918
(clears throat)

05:25.793 --> 05:27.761
(people murmuring)

05:27.795 --> 05:29.730
This is what happens
with free speech!

05:29.763 --> 05:31.565
I'm being dragged
from this floor!

05:31.599 --> 05:33.567
This sit-in is being

05:33.601 --> 05:36.904
shut down through fascist
Republican tactics!

05:36.937 --> 05:39.540
Seriously?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.847
Did you see what the
Republicans are doing?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.882
Can you believe it?

06:28.956 --> 06:31.091
*

06:45.939 --> 06:47.441
LAUREL:
Is everything all right?

06:47.475 --> 06:48.909
There's no sign
of any blueprints here,

06:48.942 --> 06:51.812
but there is a security...
(door opens)

06:51.845 --> 06:53.714
Do you need
anything, sir?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.749
Uh, no, Gary.
Thank you.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.221
There is a security badge
that might come in handy.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.492
It looks like it's to
the Manassas construction site.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.926
You're kidding.
No.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.995
And you won't get in trouble
for this?
I hope not.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.097
Okay. I'll tell
Gustav and Rochelle.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.999
Love you.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.167
(excited chatter on TV)

07:14.201 --> 07:17.037
Yes, I did just say that.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.872
You did.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.041
I'm not sure why.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.844
It's just one of those things
you say when you're hanging up.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.713
Yeah. Red and I say it
to each other all the time.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.815
Okay. I'm hanging up now.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.083
Hey. Love you.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.061
(dialing)

07:42.796 --> 07:44.498
Rochelle. It's Laurel.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.834
No blueprint,
but we have a security badge.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.237
* Tree that's standing
by the water *

07:50.270 --> 07:54.708
* We shall not be moved

07:54.742 --> 07:56.844
* We will stand
and fight together *

07:56.877 --> 07:58.612
* We shall not be moved

07:58.646 --> 08:00.047
* Just like a tree

08:00.080 --> 08:02.082
* That's standing by the water

08:02.115 --> 08:04.918
It's fantastic! Isn't it?
(phone ringing)

08:04.952 --> 08:07.120
And it looks like it worked.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.656
(chuckles)

08:08.689 --> 08:10.691
Hey, Red. How are you doing?

08:10.724 --> 08:11.959
Not very good, Luke.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.261
I'm just watching you on C-SPAN.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.130
Quite a drama.
Yes.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.967
That's one thing I've learned
from you: the voters like drama.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.101
What do you need?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.537
I think we should talk,
you and me.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.072
We have talked.
No, no, no, no.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.273
Come to my office.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.109
We'll negotiate. Yeah?

08:29.142 --> 08:31.011
This is me learning from you.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.113
Compromise. It's essential.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.248
You want to compromise?

08:35.282 --> 08:37.150
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.687
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Lunch.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.655
Lunch.

08:41.689 --> 08:45.025
* We shall not,
we shall not be moved *

08:45.058 --> 08:48.962
* Just like a tree that's
standing by the water *

08:48.996 --> 08:51.932
* We shall not be moved

08:54.067 --> 08:57.304
* We shall not,
we shall not be moved *

08:57.337 --> 09:00.073
* We will stand
and fight together *

09:00.107 --> 09:02.042
* We shall not be moved

09:02.075 --> 09:04.044
* Just like the tree
that's standing *

09:04.077 --> 09:06.947
* By the water

09:06.980 --> 09:10.651
* We shall not be moved...

09:17.257 --> 09:19.192
(door opens)

09:20.060 --> 09:22.062
Director. How are you?

09:22.095 --> 09:23.664
Not good.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.298
Sorry to hear that.
Health issue?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.167
Mind if I turn this on?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.002
And I especially condemn
the strong-arm tactics

09:29.036 --> 09:30.270
of the Capitol Police.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.172
I mean, come on, now, people...

09:32.205 --> 09:34.174
I think we should
talk, Senator.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.743
We hav talked, Director.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.078
No. You leaked,
Senator.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.014
You were offered a CIA briefing,
and you leaked.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.083
It's a criminal offense.
Yes,

09:43.116 --> 09:45.252
and the special prosecutor
already investigated
and found nothing.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.621
I didn't leak to the press,
I didn't leak to anyone.
No,

09:47.655 --> 09:49.322
the special prosecutor
disappeared

09:49.356 --> 09:51.024
before he could find anything.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.627
And what is there to find?

09:53.661 --> 09:55.162
(chuckles)

09:55.195 --> 09:56.630
A witness.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.098
(singing on TV continues)

09:58.131 --> 10:00.000
(TV turns off)

10:02.903 --> 10:05.773
(knocks on glass)
You enjoy being a senator,
sir, don't you?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.808
But if this comes out,
that you leaked,

10:07.841 --> 10:11.011
you might have to resign.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.081
Laurel, this is Director
Isenstadt from the CIA.
I don't think you've met.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.251
LAUREL: No.
Senator, I think we should
discuss this on our own.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.021
He was just threatening me.
I thought you should hear.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.189
I would treat this
more seriously.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.124
He thinks I leaked
the CIA briefing.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.127
He says he has a witness.
When you're in
a more serious

10:27.160 --> 10:28.996
frame of mind,
Senator...

10:29.029 --> 10:31.699
(tears paper)
you and I should
discuss your options.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.700
My options?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.869
Really?
What might they be?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.906
Good to meet
you, Ms. Healy.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.241
(sighs)

10:41.274 --> 10:42.275
(door opens)

10:42.309 --> 10:45.145
(chuckles softly)

10:45.178 --> 10:47.147
He's bluffing.
Says he has a witness.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.017
To you leaking?
Yeah.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.786
Unlikely.
Unless you turn on me.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.956
Or Dad.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.228
("You Might Think" by The Cars
playing on speakers)

11:03.130 --> 11:04.297
(music louder)

11:08.301 --> 11:10.337
Hello?

11:16.143 --> 11:19.012
* Well, you might think
I'm crazy *

11:19.046 --> 11:20.480
Hey. Dad?

11:20.513 --> 11:23.951
* To hang around with you

11:23.984 --> 11:26.119
* Maybe you think I'm lucky

11:26.153 --> 11:27.988
You alright?

11:28.021 --> 11:30.190
* To have something to do

11:32.292 --> 11:35.228
What do you mean?

11:40.067 --> 11:42.269
Did you talk to
the CIA about Luke?

11:42.302 --> 11:45.038
I'm pronating too much.
I need new shoes.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.274
They're saying they have a
witness who says Luke leaked.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.442
You were there.
I was there.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.344
I didn't talk to the CIA,
so did you?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.413
I told them the truth.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.282
You should try it sometime.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.017
You're seriously gonna
hurt your son?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.352
No, I'm gonna tell the truth.
Oh, really?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.188
Like the truth of how many times
you screwed him over?

12:01.221 --> 12:04.491
(sighs) Come on, Laurel,
this isn't personal.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.794
His first election, his first
loss, what did you tell him?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.929
I just wanna go running.
You told him

12:08.962 --> 12:10.764
to never embarrass the family
like that again.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.199
And he didn't.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.266
He was in tears.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.036
You should've held him.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.406
Why are you doing this to me?
It's not personal.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.208
He looked up to you.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.376
Luke wanted to be you, and you
said he embarrassed you.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.112
I was trying to toughen him.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.347
No. No, you wanted
to hurt him.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.082
You wanted to hurt
him for losing.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.550
No, I didn't.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.353
That's all that ever
mattered to you, just winning.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.759
What?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.430
Thanks for dropping by, Laurel.

12:43.463 --> 12:47.067
Let them out.
Come back to us.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.401
I have to go running.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.103
You know, that was
the exact moment

12:50.137 --> 12:52.239
that Luke lost
his faith in you.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.342
He admired you, everything
about you, before that.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.311
Make your son proud, Dad.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.313
You don't have to be
who you were.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.218
I have to get
cross-trainers.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.922
So what happened?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.858
-I was talking to my dad, and--
-Shh!

13:14.895 --> 13:18.866
I was talking to my dad,
and a bug...

13:18.899 --> 13:21.101
leaked out.
Why?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.236
Why did it leak out?
I have no idea.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.405
He grabbed his ear
before any more could.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.007
What was he doing?
Nothing.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.375
We were just talking.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.377
But, he seemed sick.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.244
I think they're weakening.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.412
ROCHELLE:
What was he talking about?

13:32.445 --> 13:34.247
He wasn't.
Actually, I was.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.884
Something about telling Luke
he embarrassed him

13:36.917 --> 13:39.352
after losing
a Senate race.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.253
Shame.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.525
It's the most deep-seated
human emotion.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.195
If there's any human part of him
you can still reach,

13:48.228 --> 13:49.429
it's through shame.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.497
I don't think he was ashamed.
I don't...

13:50.530 --> 13:52.432
GUSTAV: Come on, politicians
can't feel ashamed.

13:52.465 --> 13:56.269
ROCHELLE: They're just like us.
Try it, shame.

13:56.303 --> 14:00.173
It's the thing buried deepest
in the mind than anything else.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.044
Here...

14:04.077 --> 14:05.612
He won't go into his jacket
again until tonight,

14:05.645 --> 14:07.981
so I need that back
by 8:00 p.m.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.950
This is great.
Thanks.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.052
(sighs)

14:12.085 --> 14:13.887
Yes, thank you.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.289
No problem.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.292
Laurel, could I talk
to you for a second?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.394
Sure.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.432
Look, this "I
love you" thing

14:25.465 --> 14:27.434
is really just something
I said automatically.
I know.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.302
I just...
Anyway, I'm the
commitment-phobe,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.304
so you don't need
to say anything.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.406
What do you mean?
What don't I have to say?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.475
Just that we shouldn't
get too serious...

14:35.508 --> 14:38.245
Do you think
we're getting too serious?

14:38.278 --> 14:41.081
No, I just...

14:41.114 --> 14:43.383
Wait, what were
you gonna say?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.020
What?

14:47.054 --> 14:50.057
Just-just give me
a minute, okay? I'm...

14:52.059 --> 14:53.526
(quietly):
I think I love you, too.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.095
What?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.429
Forget it.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.498
(chuckles, groans)
No, no. No, seriously,

14:58.531 --> 15:01.501
I didn't hear
what you said.
(chuckles)

15:01.534 --> 15:05.172
Maybe I love you, too.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.174
That's all.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.210
If the world's gonna end,
I thought I should say it.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.346
Wait. Just wait.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.649
You can't just say that
and... walk away.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.086
(sighs)

15:19.119 --> 15:22.122
I think I love you, too.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.497
*

15:34.467 --> 15:35.735
(keys clacking)

15:35.768 --> 15:38.338
*

15:50.017 --> 15:52.519
(whirring)

15:52.552 --> 15:54.487
*

16:10.103 --> 16:12.505
(groans)

16:14.107 --> 16:17.577
*

16:23.116 --> 16:25.518
Blueprints?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.121
Fine.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.593
Just look straight,
act like them,

16:33.626 --> 16:35.262
don't react.
Yeah.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.131
Let's do this.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.600
(beeps)

16:45.305 --> 16:48.641
Okay.
We just have to salt the beds.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.344
Just a few boxes in each.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.613
Oh, no. Oh, no,
oh, no.
Just relax.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.747
Just act normal.
What are you doing?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.349
GUSTAV:
Working.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.052
Like you.
Just working. See?

17:01.188 --> 17:04.557
How unchivalrous. Making
the woman do the hard work.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.060
Well, you know,
I tried to push it, but...

17:07.094 --> 17:08.628
(whispers):
you know women.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.497
(all chuckle)

17:10.530 --> 17:12.532
I insisted.
Here, let me.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.501
No, it's... Sure.
Oh.
(grunting)

17:14.534 --> 17:17.537
Where you headed?
Uh, inside.
Uh, you know, um...

17:17.570 --> 17:20.039
Plot nine?
Right.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.677
So, your name is?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.614
Dr. Bo...
Uh, Wheatus.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.083
Red Wheatus.
Senator.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.584
It's nice to meet you.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.120
Nice to meet you as well.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.854
Figured I'd take a break
from Capitol Hill,

17:34.887 --> 17:41.161
come on down, and see
how y'all are doing.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.097
We're doing just fine.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.433
Almost done.
Just getting the beds in.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.136
It'll be a week. I'm Brian.
Ah. Good, good, good.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.138
And, um, this is
my... assistant,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.573
Roch... sheen.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.209
Rasheen Moleen.

17:56.243 --> 17:59.346
Nice to meet you.
And you.
We were just...

18:01.448 --> 18:03.450
You're just...?

18:03.483 --> 18:06.319
Just... just...

18:06.353 --> 18:09.522
helping out. You know,
it takes a village, right?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.458
Where are we piping
the water next?

18:11.491 --> 18:13.526
The back nine.
Good. Where's that?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.228
Come with us. We're
heading there now.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.230
This is more disorganized
than I thought it would be.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.232
Well, we're still
working out the kinks.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.668
You might be interested
in telling the senator

18:21.701 --> 18:24.771
your concerns.
The senator?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.506
Do I know you?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.341
Hello?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.510
Senator, we have that
conference call that we need

18:30.543 --> 18:33.380
to get onto. Very important.
Ah, yes. The call.
The call, yes.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.348
Uh, hello.
Oh. Oh, right.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.116
Yes...
Yes, yes, yes!

18:38.651 --> 18:41.254
(grunting)

18:49.896 --> 18:51.698
ALL:
* ...be moved

18:51.731 --> 18:53.733
* We shall...

18:53.766 --> 18:55.435
Okay, quick thing.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.438
Uh, yeah. Keep
it up, guys.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.207
After you lost
the first Senate race,

19:00.240 --> 19:02.375
do you remember
what Dad told you?

19:02.409 --> 19:04.744
Sis, I'm a
little busy here.
There's a chance shame

19:04.777 --> 19:06.746
might have an impact
on Dad's infection.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.581
Is this what
your friends say?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.617
No, this is what I saw.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.353
Well, here's the thing,
Dad doesn't shame easily.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.355
I know.
Keep it up.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.757
But I reminded him of the night
you lost the Senate race,

19:17.790 --> 19:20.827
and... he cried.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.297
He cried about me losing?

19:24.331 --> 19:27.334
No, he cried about what
he said to you.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.371
Then he had something
in his eye.
No.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.641
No, he's still in there.
Laurel,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.376
he was never in there
to begin with.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.677
He never was our father.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.313
He was our... manager.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.315
Okay, well, what else
will shame him?

19:42.349 --> 19:43.750
What else about him
pisses you off?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.785
What else
did he say?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.820
It's not about me.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.457
It was never about me.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.225
He always loved you.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.860
More than me.
What are you talking about?

19:53.893 --> 19:56.729
You really want to
make him ashamed?

19:56.763 --> 20:00.733
Remember that camera you got
for your ninth birthday?

20:00.767 --> 20:03.503
If anything makes
him ashamed,

20:03.536 --> 20:05.638
that would.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.674
* We shall not be moved

20:07.707 --> 20:11.311
Today is my ninth birthday,
and it's the best one ever

20:11.344 --> 20:14.981
because I finally got
what I wanted, a camera.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.518
Zoom in. Zoom out.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.487
Zoom in. Zoom out.
DEAN:
What's this?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.722
This is the movie of my life...
I just found it, Dad.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.492
Remember, you bought me
my first camera?

20:25.525 --> 20:26.793
That's my mom.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.961
She got me these shoes.
I missed this birthday?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.963
You did.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.266
Don't remember that.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.901
I heard my dad's car.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.536
(door opens)
Wait, here he comes.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.571
DEAN:
Oh, brother.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.706
LIZ:
Where were you?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.575
(sighs)
I-I couldn't get away.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.512
LIZ: You weren't at the
office. So don't even try.
Oh, please.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.913
That's enough.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.450
How do you turn this thing off?

20:50.483 --> 20:52.552
I'll turn it off when it's over.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.555
LIZ:
Your daughter was crying.
DEAN: Well, she'll get over it.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.824
LIZ:
Will she? You missed

20:57.857 --> 21:01.361
your daughter's birthday
to be with your girlfriend.
Oh, please. Just don't start.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.364
Turn it off.
LIZ:
It's one thing to do it to me.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.333
But to her?
She doesn't even know
where I was.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.000
LIZ:
She knows you weren't here!

21:08.034 --> 21:09.769
DEAN: Would you please keep
your voice down?
Please?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.871
Don't tell me what to do.
You should have been here!

21:11.904 --> 21:13.373
You really want me
to move out?

21:13.406 --> 21:16.008
I didn't know you were there.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.811
I know you're lying. It's time.
DEAN: Oh, for God's sake!
Okay, I'm done.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.881
It's time.
I am done!

21:21.914 --> 21:23.950
LAUREL:
I love my dad.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.719
And I did.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.791
(Laurel crying on video)

21:32.825 --> 21:35.828
(sniffling)

21:40.900 --> 21:42.735
Dad? Dad.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.905
Dad, are you okay?

21:54.013 --> 21:56.416
You've got five minutes, Red,
then I'm back to our sit-in.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.786
Whoa, whoa. Calm down,
Senator, just have a seat.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.021
(scoffs) I've have been sitting
for way too many hours,

22:02.054 --> 22:03.490
thanks to you. So...

22:03.523 --> 22:04.791
(clears throat)
what's the deal?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.394
All right, well,
if you refuse to sit,

22:07.427 --> 22:09.962
fine, but, uh,
I'm a bit queasy, so...

22:09.996 --> 22:12.465
(chuckles)
could you just s-stand still,

22:12.499 --> 22:14.567
right-right there, for a minute?

22:14.601 --> 22:15.968
(desk drawer opens)

22:16.002 --> 22:17.136
Talk.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.671
Thank you. Well...
(phone rings)

22:18.705 --> 22:19.839
Here's my offer.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.674
Oh, come on.

22:21.708 --> 22:22.709
Hello?

22:25.945 --> 22:27.580
Uh, Laurel, what is it?

22:27.614 --> 22:28.948
W-What?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.420
No, y-- yes.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.687
Wait, when?

22:34.721 --> 22:37.790
(gun clicks)
But how did...

22:37.824 --> 22:39.426
Yes, I'm-I'm on my way.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.960
(phone beeps)

22:40.993 --> 22:43.129
Uh, we're gonna
need to delay this.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.631
Why?

22:44.664 --> 22:45.765
W-W-What's wrong?

22:45.798 --> 22:48.435
Uh, my dad is sick.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.436
(door opens)

22:49.469 --> 22:50.437
(door closes)

22:50.470 --> 22:52.405
Damn Healys.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.912
Do you need anything, Senator?

22:59.946 --> 23:01.714
No.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.987
Has anyone been in here, buddy?

23:08.855 --> 23:10.557
In your office?

23:10.590 --> 23:11.924
No. (chuckles)
The intern.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.826
What's his name?
Gary.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.061
He hasn't been in here.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.062
Are you sure?

23:16.095 --> 23:17.697
Yeah.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.966
Why don't you
bring him in here?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.535
No.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.536
I'll go talk to him.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.071
(laughs)

23:25.104 --> 23:26.706
You're a good person,
aren't you?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.074
No, just a person.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.743
No, it's not a bad thing,

23:30.777 --> 23:31.911
to be good.

23:31.944 --> 23:35.582
You know, sometimes I...

23:35.615 --> 23:37.650
I think you're like
the son I never had.

23:37.684 --> 23:38.851
That's nice, Senator.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.787
Then sometimes
I think you're not.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.667
(door closes)

23:55.702 --> 23:57.069
(sighs)

23:57.103 --> 23:58.671
Did it work?

23:58.705 --> 24:00.006
Yes, but no.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.007
We have to find another way.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.609
Okay, where's the badge?

24:02.642 --> 24:04.176
Any day now.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.478
Oh, oh.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.679
ROCHELLE:
Ooh, in his sock?

24:06.713 --> 24:08.047
GARETH:
Yeah, it's in your sock.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.048
Here you go.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.653
Do you need help
with that?

24:13.686 --> 24:14.954
No. No.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.590
I think I can do this.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.764
Where the hell...?

24:27.099 --> 24:29.936
Is-is this what you're
looking for... Senator?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.237
Yes. Yeah.

24:31.270 --> 24:34.073
Yeah. Well,
see you tomorrow.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.842
Just...

24:35.875 --> 24:37.043
(sighs)

24:38.545 --> 24:41.881
It's not easy...
seeing him like that.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.082
(sniffles)

24:43.115 --> 24:45.217
You all right?

24:46.653 --> 24:48.054
My whole childhood,

24:48.087 --> 24:51.090
I wanted to see Dad
show some kind of shame

24:51.123 --> 24:53.560
for what he did to Mom.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.530
Now I have.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.966
How does it feel?

25:02.101 --> 25:04.537
Awful.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.652
(yawning)

25:22.021 --> 25:23.990
Are you serious? It's...

25:24.023 --> 25:25.558
Oh, it's 9:00 a.m.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.026
I have a solution.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.095
Another way into
the hothouse?
No.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.063
We don't have to get
into the hothouse.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.331
They're still a week away.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.967
Okay. Then... what?

25:35.001 --> 25:38.571
We need to sabotage
the trees.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.673
They're in the trees now.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.141
We need to make
them absciss.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.910
Absciss means...
I know what it means.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.145
...make them shed,
make their blossoms drop

25:46.178 --> 25:50.082
before the bugs can get
to the hothouses.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.919
And how do we do that?
Mm.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.590
Ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.371
Shame?

26:12.404 --> 26:14.106
Yes.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.108
It worked on my dad.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.644
The person is still in there.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.111
He can be reached.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.113
Yeah, Red really
doesn't do shame.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.249
It's not his brand.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.753
Well, he was crying last week.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.856
So you want to figure
out what'll shame him?

26:29.889 --> 26:32.124
Yes.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.196
God, you're sexy.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.200
(both sigh)

26:46.272 --> 26:48.708
(inhaling deeply)

26:48.741 --> 26:52.244
Lana. He keeps
calling you Lana.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.881
Yes.

26:57.884 --> 27:00.019
I need your laptop.

27:00.052 --> 27:03.890
(Red crying)
Do you need a moment, Senator?

27:03.923 --> 27:07.093
I just miss her, and I'm...

27:09.796 --> 27:11.230
I'm so ashamed.

27:11.263 --> 27:12.965
MONARCH:
Okay, why don't we take a break,

27:12.999 --> 27:15.802
and, uh, we'll be back
to discuss

27:15.835 --> 27:19.105
more on the congressional
dysfunction.
Oh. Lana.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.272
(Red crying)

27:20.306 --> 27:21.874
RED:
Where are you, Lana?

27:21.908 --> 27:23.109
(click)

27:23.142 --> 27:26.245
I think I saw her
photo in Red's drawer.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.782
Whose?

27:29.816 --> 27:32.685
Lana's.

27:37.757 --> 27:42.294
So we just sprinkle some
ammonium nitrate on the roots?

27:42.328 --> 27:43.996
That's what it says.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.297
How long does it take?

27:45.331 --> 27:47.900
Depends on how
much we use.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.302
Hey, let's not draw a lot
of attention to ourselves.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.238
We wouldn't want...

27:52.271 --> 27:53.973
(siren chirps)

27:54.006 --> 27:56.743
Yup.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.144
This is not gonna look good.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.247
No.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.716
Is there a problem, officer?

28:03.750 --> 28:05.251
License
and registration.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.987
A flickering tail light
perchance?
Gustav!

28:08.020 --> 28:10.189
Excuse my
friend, officer.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.490
Actually, you were
speeding, sir.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.359
(indistinct radio transmission)

28:13.392 --> 28:15.494
What?

28:15.527 --> 28:18.931
I was most definitely
not speeding.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.199
Rochelle, you...
You know what?

28:20.232 --> 28:22.769
I think we should
probably record this.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.071
Ma'am, please put
the phone away.
Why would
I do that?

28:25.104 --> 28:28.007
Because you're not allowed
to record an officer in D.C.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.375
Actually, in D.C.,

28:29.408 --> 28:31.377
all you need is one
party's consent, so, smile.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.045
Not when you're obstructing
police business.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.314
Ah, here we go.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.917
(sirens wailing,
indistinct radio transmission)

28:39.318 --> 28:41.954
This is bad.
Don't talk. Shh.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.255
It makes them angry.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.257
You've been
through this before?

28:45.291 --> 28:47.393
It's why I don't have a car.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.196
Oh, great.
Now what?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.098
(car door bell dings)

28:52.131 --> 28:53.365
(indistinct radio transmission)

28:53.399 --> 28:55.334
Well, well, well.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.338
What are the odds?

29:05.477 --> 29:09.015
* We shall not,
we shall not be moved *

29:09.048 --> 29:11.483
* We shall not, we shall not
be moved *

29:11.517 --> 29:14.353
* Just like a tree
that's standing by the water...*

29:14.386 --> 29:17.489
Senator Healy,
may we have a word?

29:17.523 --> 29:20.860
So, you're a
united front now?

29:20.893 --> 29:24.430
You've been getting people
to steal my security badge?

29:24.463 --> 29:26.298
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.900
Call my office,
make an appointment.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.002
Right now, I have
a floor to sit on.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.204
We think
you should stop this.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.906
Check on your witness.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.042
I think you'll find he's
not available anymore.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.277
It's not about your father.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.479
"I love you, Lukey Pookie."

29:40.512 --> 29:43.049
ISENSTADT:
This is about something
more serious.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.852
There's a sex tape.

29:45.885 --> 29:48.354
* We shall not,
we shall not be moved... *

29:48.387 --> 29:50.156
ISENSTADT:
Not a good one.

29:50.189 --> 29:53.092
* That's standing by the water

29:53.125 --> 29:55.361
* We shall not be moved...

29:55.394 --> 29:57.930
Thank you.
(clears throat)

29:57.964 --> 30:01.400
Thank you all.
* Black and white together...

30:01.433 --> 30:04.937
This has been
an amazing achievement.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.539
Now I think it's time to
bring this sit-in to a close.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.175
(senators exclaiming)

30:09.208 --> 30:11.243
What? No!
Yes!

30:11.277 --> 30:14.080
Yes. We have
made our point.

30:14.113 --> 30:17.850
Now I think
we should let the majority vote.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.251
It's time.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.053
(overlapping chatter)

30:22.288 --> 30:24.256
Don't make any
furtive movements.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.259
Excuse me, I know
how to be black.
ANTHONY:
Turn around.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.361
(indistinct radio transmission)

30:29.395 --> 30:31.363
What's the
fertilizer for?

30:31.397 --> 30:33.599
My friend bought a tree.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.434
Must be a big tree.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.569
If you would just
check my ID...
I have it.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.105
No, you have my
driver's license.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.339
I mean my work ID.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.141
It's in my back pocket.
If you would just...

30:42.174 --> 30:44.343
Do not reach
in your pocket!
Please.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.278
Just check my back...

30:46.312 --> 30:48.314
pocket.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.453
You work for the NSA?

30:54.486 --> 30:55.621
Yes, sir.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.390
I'm a senior
intelligence officer.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.591
ANTHONY:
Damn it.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.128
Sorry to bother you,
Agent Triplett.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.065
You folks are free to leave.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.200
Sorry about
the misunderstanding.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.236
Thank you.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.239
You're NSA?!

31:13.272 --> 31:16.142
Of course.
What'd you think?

31:16.175 --> 31:18.177
(scoffs)

31:19.411 --> 31:22.081
That's insane.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.983
(classical music playing

31:24.016 --> 31:28.420
DIANE:
All those in favor of allowing
the budget to pass as is.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.225
The motion is passed.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.694
The budget will go
in front of the full Senate

31:35.727 --> 31:38.164
without bifurcation.

31:38.197 --> 31:40.566
(scattered applause)

31:40.599 --> 31:42.701
There, you see that?

31:42.734 --> 31:45.037
We can get things done
after all.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.007
We shall not be moved, my ass.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.341
Huh?
Damn it.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.077
* We shall be...

31:51.110 --> 31:52.378
Look, the sentence needs
to be precise and direct.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.946
LUKE: Well, your
precision won't matter

31:53.980 --> 31:55.381
unless we get there in time.
Where are we?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.583
STOCKWELL: Almost done.
So you didn't even
bother voting?

31:57.616 --> 31:59.051
You just let
it go through?
It wouldn't have mattered.

31:59.085 --> 31:59.952
They had the numbers.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.720
Well, that's why
you were doing the sit-in.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.422
I don't understand.
Laurel, will you please stop

32:03.455 --> 32:04.590
Wasn't that the point?
telling me how to do my job?

32:04.623 --> 32:06.125
I'm not telling you...
Can you...

32:06.158 --> 32:08.327
Can you trust me?
Sorry, I need
to focus. Shh.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.663
All motorcycle helmets
are required to pass

32:11.697 --> 32:13.132
Federal
motor vehicle...
Are you serious?

32:13.165 --> 32:15.067
You had a motorcycle
helmet bill?

32:15.101 --> 32:17.069
Yes. Very important.
We have the votes for it.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.005
Yes, Republicans, too.
Good. Let's go.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.106
Wait... wait.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.373
What are you going to do?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.646
The trick was to make
the motorcycle helmet law

32:27.679 --> 32:29.615
public health policy,

32:29.648 --> 32:31.750
and give it a robust
advertis...
Okay, I don't understand.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.620
Once it's about
the public health,

32:34.653 --> 32:36.622
the asterisk includes language

32:36.655 --> 32:38.457
that affects paragraph 1403,

32:38.490 --> 32:41.160
sub-paragraph six,
footnotes 11 through...
Meaning?

32:41.193 --> 32:44.130
The motorcycle helmet law
overrides the farm bill

32:44.163 --> 32:45.497
on issues that cross
state lines.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.366
He lost.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.203
He just doesn't
know it yet.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.039
RED:
What the hell?!

32:53.072 --> 32:55.507
"Funding for the federal
motorcycle helmet law

32:55.541 --> 32:58.110
supersedes all funding
for paragraph 1403..."

32:58.144 --> 32:59.611
(angry muttering)

32:59.645 --> 33:01.280
(shouting):
Gareth!

33:01.313 --> 33:02.481
Gareth?

33:06.152 --> 33:07.519
Ah.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.121
Here she is.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.256
Yes.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.757
Here I am.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.193
Looks like it's come down
to the two of us.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.395
Sure does.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.298
Come on in.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.303
Sit.

33:33.345 --> 33:37.149
All the children
have gone to bed.

33:37.183 --> 33:40.186
It's just the adults now.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.487
Shall we talk?

33:41.520 --> 33:44.223
Sure.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.225
You go first.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.265
What I don't understand is
why you didn't say anything.

33:53.299 --> 33:56.468
You didn't say anything
about your car, either.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.570
Yes, but there
is a big difference

33:58.604 --> 34:00.806
between owning a BMW,
and being a senior

34:00.839 --> 34:02.841
intelligence officer
with the NSA.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.276
Yes.
Hey, guys.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.477
Sorry to interrupt.

34:05.511 --> 34:06.712
Where's Laurel?

34:06.745 --> 34:08.580
She went upstairs
to find you.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.182
To...

34:13.619 --> 34:18.524
Your brother kind of tricked me
with this helmet law.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.492
Yes, he can be
sneaky that way.

34:20.526 --> 34:23.229
Seems to run
in the family...

34:24.230 --> 34:25.564
Lana?

34:25.597 --> 34:27.666
What?

34:27.699 --> 34:30.669
You were about to call me Lana,
weren't you?

34:30.702 --> 34:32.238
It doesn't matter.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.106
We have the grassroots.

34:34.140 --> 34:35.507
We have the
gerrymandered districts.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.209
You mean the
crop circles.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.744
We have everything
for a permanent majority.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.346
I look like her,
don't I?

34:42.214 --> 34:43.849
I looked online.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.284
Except for the hair.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.786
Maybe if I put it back?

34:47.819 --> 34:49.721
How's that?

34:50.789 --> 34:52.424
What are we talking about here?

34:54.893 --> 34:56.295
Your first love.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.201
My first love...

35:02.234 --> 35:04.236
was and is
our great country.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.271
You turned Lana in.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.538
She was an illegal immigrant

35:06.572 --> 35:07.706
working in your dorm.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.141
(laughing)

35:09.175 --> 35:10.209
You were
in love with her,

35:10.242 --> 35:11.310
but you hated the fact

35:11.343 --> 35:13.545
that you were
in love with her.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.452
This is disgusting.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.321
You want to make everything
about sex.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.722
I didn't say anything
about sex.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.324
I said "love."

35:25.357 --> 35:26.825
I couldn't have been
in love with her.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.260
She wasn't my type.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.861
Then why do you keep
calling me Lana?

35:33.332 --> 35:34.900
Here's the truth.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.704
You're ashamed
of what you did.

35:38.737 --> 35:39.905
I'm proud of what I did.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.640
Then what
did you do?

35:41.673 --> 35:43.242
I turned in a woman

35:43.275 --> 35:44.876
who was in this
country illegally.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.347
She's dead now.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.849
Did you know that?

35:50.882 --> 35:53.252
You sent her
to Guatemala.

35:53.285 --> 35:57.389
She was born here,
but her parents weren't.

35:57.423 --> 35:59.191
You're making this up.
No.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.392
And you know I'm not.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.362
Go on.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.632
Let it out.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.200
You know you want to.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.470
Get it out.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.642
You need to be...

36:17.643 --> 36:18.944
What?

36:18.977 --> 36:20.379
What? Come on.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.447
What do I need to be?
I'm Lana.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.282
What do I need to be?

36:23.315 --> 36:25.217
(gasps)
(door opens)

36:28.254 --> 36:30.456
(glass breaking)

36:30.489 --> 36:31.757
(grunting)

36:31.790 --> 36:33.725
(straining):
Stop. No.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.363
(grunts)

36:37.396 --> 36:38.964
Why?

36:40.399 --> 36:42.601
(straining):
Why are you doing this?

36:42.634 --> 36:45.237
(groans)
I love you, Gareth.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.306
Why are you...?

36:47.339 --> 36:49.375
Why are you...?
(gunshot)

36:49.408 --> 36:51.410
(Gareth panting)

36:56.047 --> 36:57.416
(screaming)

36:57.449 --> 36:59.585
My butt.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.821
(groaning)

37:02.854 --> 37:04.556
You shot me in the butt.

37:06.625 --> 37:07.826
(Red grunts)

37:11.930 --> 37:13.599
There it goes.
Hey, it's going
under the door.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.435
LAUREL:
Get it!

37:16.468 --> 37:18.304
(crunch, squish)

37:20.539 --> 37:21.573
Oops.

37:21.607 --> 37:22.808
Sorry, Senator.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.443
I'll...
I'll get some paper towels,

37:24.476 --> 37:27.479
and...

37:27.513 --> 37:29.348
clean this up.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.452
Oh, and I got your smoothie.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.762
(high-pitched screeching)

37:46.498 --> 37:49.067
(screeching grows louder)

37:49.100 --> 37:52.471
For years now, we've let
Republicans rule this chamber.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.906
Well, I am sick and tired
of playing second fiddle

37:54.940 --> 37:56.475
to some of these...

37:56.508 --> 37:59.345
(high-pitched screeching)

37:59.378 --> 38:01.647
DIANE:
Senator.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.283
Do you want to relinquish
your time, Senator?

38:06.452 --> 38:08.487
(high-pitched screeching)

38:19.565 --> 38:21.733
(panicked screaming)

38:28.574 --> 38:30.976
(high-pitched screeching)

38:32.143 --> 38:34.446
Oh, my God.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.996
Whoa, whoa.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.632
*

38:57.636 --> 38:59.405
GUSTAV (sighs):
How long is this supposed
to take?

38:59.438 --> 39:01.607
ROCHELLE:
I don't know.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.408
Could be a day,
could be a week.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.776
Why don't you ask
your NSA friends?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.478
This is really bothering
you, isn't it?

39:06.512 --> 39:08.013
(sighs)
I just...

39:08.046 --> 39:09.548
I don't understand why
we've been running around

39:09.581 --> 39:11.517
with salt and fertilizer,
when you could have just

39:11.550 --> 39:13.419
waved your NSA magic wand.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.586
My NSA magic wand?

39:14.620 --> 39:15.554
Your government
connections.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.022
Your ability to wiretap.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.491
First of all,
I do not wiretap.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.992
Okay?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.594
Second of all,
I was on leave.

39:22.628 --> 39:23.895
Third of all, this is
only bothering you

39:23.929 --> 39:26.532
because you have
a massive crush on me.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.734
Okay. I'm going now.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.407
See?

39:35.441 --> 39:36.608
You can't get
enough of me.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.577
My...

39:38.610 --> 39:41.012
magnetism.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.451
I said, you can't
get enough...

39:50.021 --> 39:51.557
Five cherry blossoms?
That's not enough.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.525
There needs to be
more than that.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.028
(rustling)

40:02.768 --> 40:05.571
(Rochelle laughing)

40:05.604 --> 40:06.705
(both laughing)

40:09.575 --> 40:11.443
Ah, we did it!

40:11.477 --> 40:12.544
(laughing)

40:12.578 --> 40:14.045
(Rochelle squealing happily)

40:16.648 --> 40:18.950
That's kind of gross.

40:22.688 --> 40:25.223
(guitar playing upbeat melody)

40:25.256 --> 40:27.593
RED:
Hey, hey.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.497
What's going on?

40:31.530 --> 40:33.632
Welcome back, Senator.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.934
*

40:35.967 --> 40:37.536
* Some things got much better

40:37.569 --> 40:39.905
* While some other things
got worse *

40:39.938 --> 40:41.473
* Let's tie up some loose ends

40:41.507 --> 40:43.241
* While the space bugs
all disperse *

40:43.274 --> 40:45.611
* All the head explosions
notwithstanding *

40:45.644 --> 40:47.779
* Mostly everything turned out
all right *

40:48.780 --> 40:50.516
* Laurel's leaving politics

40:50.549 --> 40:52.150
* She's tired of D.C.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.153
* Someday she might finish
her dream documentary *

40:55.186 --> 40:57.756
* She and Gareth
got a place together *

40:57.789 --> 40:59.991
* They kiss and canoodle
every night *

41:01.660 --> 41:04.229
How many kids
do you want?

41:05.063 --> 41:07.165
Zero.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.669
Why? How-how many kids
do you want?

41:10.702 --> 41:14.239
The normal amount,
like five or six.

41:14.272 --> 41:17.576
*

41:17.609 --> 41:18.744
* Red made some mistakes

41:18.777 --> 41:20.612
* But never really
paid the price *

41:20.646 --> 41:22.013
* He stayed on as a senator

41:22.047 --> 41:24.082
* Got reelected twice

41:24.115 --> 41:27.252
* Easily distracted,
not intelligent as such *

41:27.285 --> 41:28.820
* Turns out having half
a brain *

41:28.854 --> 41:32.558
* Just doesn't matter
all that much *

41:32.591 --> 41:35.727
Well, I'm not a scientist.

41:35.761 --> 41:37.195
Am I?

41:37.228 --> 41:38.697
(quietly):
No, sir.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.999
So, I-I can't tell you 100%

41:41.032 --> 41:43.068
whether global warming is real,

41:43.101 --> 41:44.736
but, uh, doggy-woggy.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.237
There is doggy-woggy.

41:46.271 --> 41:48.740
Wh-why can't I have
a doggy-woggy?

41:51.810 --> 41:54.680
What I mean is, uh, there are
those who, uh, believe that, uh,

41:54.713 --> 41:58.049
global warming is a conspiracy
put forward by the Chinese.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.752
You tell me.

42:00.786 --> 42:01.920
* Same for all the senators

42:01.953 --> 42:03.989
* Who needs a perfect brain?

42:04.022 --> 42:05.657
* Powerful and stupid

42:05.691 --> 42:07.258
* But at least
they're not insane *

42:07.292 --> 42:09.327
* Somehow everything still
holds together *

42:09.360 --> 42:12.698
* Even when it's running
off the rails *

42:12.731 --> 42:14.299
* Dean lost something precious

42:14.332 --> 42:16.334
* And it really took a toll

42:16.367 --> 42:18.136
* He'd gladly trade
his Parkinson's *

42:18.169 --> 42:19.805
* For partial mind control

42:19.838 --> 42:21.673
* So the ending isn't perfect

42:21.707 --> 42:24.175
* But at least there's love
and kindness when it fails *

42:24.209 --> 42:25.310
Help.

42:25.343 --> 42:26.645
* You can vote your conscience

42:26.678 --> 42:28.814
* You can vote to make a point

42:28.847 --> 42:30.348
* Or cut and dry
your principles *

42:30.381 --> 42:32.183
* And smoke them like a joint

42:32.217 --> 42:35.220
* Though we rarely rise
to be the best that we can be *

42:35.253 --> 42:37.355
* Just stand up
and be a citizen *

42:37.388 --> 42:39.958
* It's called democracy

42:39.991 --> 42:43.294
* Luke was forced to leave but
got a better offer right away *

42:43.328 --> 42:45.330
* A Wall Street firm
with slightly fewer principles *

42:45.363 --> 42:46.865
* And higher pay

42:46.898 --> 42:48.366
* Laurel came to help him

42:48.399 --> 42:50.201
* Right before another
market crash *

42:50.235 --> 42:52.070
* When everyone was long
on risk *

42:52.103 --> 42:53.839
* And dumbly, sadly,
short on cash *

42:53.872 --> 42:55.373
* But that's another story

42:55.406 --> 42:57.709
* That they'll write someday,
I'll bet *

42:57.743 --> 42:58.977
* And as for all
the space bugs *

42:59.010 --> 43:03.281
* Well, so far,
nobody's seen them yet. *
