MERRICK:
This is a declaration of war.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.647
One we cannot let go
unanswered.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.584
The other Barons have fled.
Gone to ground.

As Ryder's rightful
and only successor...

00:34.135 --> 00:36.637
All powers of this Barony
fall to me.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.315
Merrick, will you administer
my oath?

01:05.199 --> 01:06.534
Put your hands
on the blade.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.410
Do you pledge to uphold
the twin pillars
of the Foundation Treaty,

01:16.444 --> 01:20.348
peace through force,
and justice without mercy?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.283
I pledge with my life.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.786
Grip the blade
and join your blood

01:25.819 --> 01:27.588
to the sword
of this Foundation Stone

and the Barons
who came before you.

01:33.261 --> 01:36.297
Do you swear to protect
and preserve the Badlands

01:36.330 --> 01:38.166
from this day forward
until your last?

01:39.333 --> 01:40.601
I swear.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.174
Kneel before your Baron.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.548
Quinn will pay
for what he has done.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.394
BAJIE: Uh, so,
the next morning,

02:41.329 --> 02:43.564
I wake up completely naked,
totally hungover.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.333
Worst birthday I've ever had.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.900
But, hey, you only turn
eleven once, right?

02:46.934 --> 02:48.636
SUNNY: Please tell me
we're almost there.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.771
BAJIE: (SNIFFS)
Whoa! You smell that?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.640

02:58.779 --> 03:00.514
SUNNY: So this is Nos' place?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.816
Yeah, but he likes to be
known as the Commandant.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.219
Guess he thinks
it gives him gravitas.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.356
That's the thing about Mechs,
they're so self-important.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.292
Mechs? Those bastards
that sold me to the mines?

03:11.325 --> 03:12.860
There has to be
some other way.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.597
(SIGHS) Do you want to
get into the Badlands
or not, all right?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.266
Then, our best way in
is through.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.600
Well, I mean,
it's technically under,

03:19.633 --> 03:21.369
but you know what I'm saying.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.672
Look at these mongrels.
See what they're carrying?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.377
Metal?
Metal.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.379
They scavenge
and trade it for food.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.248
Then, Nos smuggles it
in tunnels into the Badlands
on the black market.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.719
You wanna see Veil?
You wanna get home?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.689
You wanna see your baby?
Huh?

03:42.490 --> 03:43.624
Then, this is our ticket in.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.560
(SIGHS) Unless you wanna walk
a few hundred more miles,

03:46.594 --> 03:48.629
find a way over the mountains?
Please say no.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.032
How well do you know
this guy?

03:52.065 --> 03:56.470
Nos? Oh. Yeah, we're,
like, thick as thieves.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.706
We go way back.
I saved his life once.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.308
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
entirely by accident.

04:00.908 --> 04:04.011
But, I mean, if it comes up,
don't mention anything.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.178
No, listen, trust me...

04:05.212 --> 04:08.248

to see my cheeky little face.

I was gonna pay you back.

You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

all my money back.

into the Badlands.

and the sword is yours.

listened to you and
stayed away from the conclave.

But I only disobeyed
because I just...

something was wrong.

You're the only reason
that I'm still alive.

to my gut instead of

07:32.620 --> 07:34.655
trying to play
by somebody else's rules.

you're spoiling
to give me a spanking,

known about Quinn.

For an advisor,
there seems to be a lot
that you don't know.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.189

08:09.823 --> 08:12.259
Quinn's reappearance
could work in our favor.

How so?

to crawl back to them

they've dealt with Quinn.

on a platter.

gain their favor.

to get into the Badlands
and become a Baron.
