00:02.003 --> 00:05.004
<i>So you grab
a chain and whack away.</i>

00:05.172 --> 00:07.295
- After you.
- I feel weird.

00:07.465 --> 00:10.716
I haven't even had an argument
with this cabinet.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.133
Hold me back.

00:16.013 --> 00:17.757
It's got a good beat
and I can dance to it.

00:17.932 --> 00:19.971
- I give it a 92.
- What are you doing?

00:20.141 --> 00:22.349
It sounds like
you're smashing furniture.

00:22.810 --> 00:25.183
Oh. You are smashing furniture.
Why?

00:25.354 --> 00:27.928
It's our new hobby.
We're antiquing this cabinet.

00:28.105 --> 00:31.024
Some people wait a hundred years.
We're just beating the tar out of it.

00:31.192 --> 00:33.813
Personally, I find knitting relaxing.

00:33.985 --> 00:36.393
It's a great way
to get out your frustration.

00:36.862 --> 00:40.445
Take that,
stupid Nobel Prize committee.

00:40.615 --> 00:42.110
May I?

00:43.117 --> 00:46.071
Take that, people who won't
buy their dear niece a car.

00:46.245 --> 00:49.162
Oh, shoot, I missed what Bob did
with the linseed oil.

00:49.789 --> 00:51.249
Well, let's ask him.

00:53.083 --> 00:56.784
- Could you go over step four again?
- How did I get...?

00:56.961 --> 00:58.290
Whoa, this needs a lot of work.

00:58.462 --> 01:01.333
Say, Bob,
you ever wired a litter box for cable?

01:01.923 --> 01:04.379
I gotta remember to crack a window
when I work with varnish.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:22.647 --> 01:26.348
I'm ready for my close-up.
Do I have food in my teeth?

01:34.157 --> 01:35.865
- Salem.
- What? What?

01:36.032 --> 01:38.986
- It was like this when I found it.
- Val and I are going to the movies.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.734
If I'm not dressed in five minutes,
I'm gonna miss my ride.

01:41.912 --> 01:44.617
Why didn't you say so?
I don't mind moving.

01:47.457 --> 01:50.709
Even if I knew what I wanted to wear,
I couldn't pick it out of this mess.

01:50.877 --> 01:53.997
- It's full of kibble crumbs.
- Brush them in a pile.

01:54.172 --> 01:55.582
I'll eat them later.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.588
Better clean this up.

01:59.009 --> 02:01.167
I forgot, I'm only allowed incantations
this week.

02:01.343 --> 02:03.301
Thank you, quizmaster.

02:03.469 --> 02:04.502
Uh...

02:04.679 --> 02:06.423
<i>Stuff is messy
This place is a zoo</i>

02:06.598 --> 02:09.384
<i>Make things that need it
Brand-spanking new</i>

02:10.976 --> 02:13.514
Let's see if it worked. Excellent.

02:15.646 --> 02:18.731
"Extra charge for cat-hair removal"?

02:18.899 --> 02:21.472
I think this is the nicest thing
we ever beat up.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.443
Except for that teamster.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.696
Oh, no.
Our antique is brand-new again.

02:27.864 --> 02:31.447
- That's odd.
- Meeting Valerie, Rialto Cinema.

02:31.617 --> 02:32.862
- See you.
- Freeze.

02:33.034 --> 02:37.328
- What? Oh, yeah. Back by 10.
- Cast any spells lately?

02:37.496 --> 02:39.157
Yeah, I cast
a make-everything-new spell.

02:39.331 --> 02:41.703
- Why?
- You made it too general. Look.

02:42.124 --> 02:45.992
I guess now would be the wrong time
to say I think it looks better like that.

02:46.169 --> 02:48.459
- Sorry. I was in a hurry.
- We witches have a saying:

02:48.630 --> 02:50.421
Haste makes a gigantic mess.

02:50.589 --> 02:52.832
Got it. Did I screw anything else up?

02:53.007 --> 02:57.254
I found the Fountain
of Youth. It's the toilet.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.630
No problem.
I'll just fix it with an undo spell.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.805
<i>I made things new
And that was bad</i>

03:02.973 --> 03:06.058
<i>So undo it all
So they won't be mad</i>

03:06.226 --> 03:09.393
Welcome back, trick knee.

03:09.561 --> 03:11.555
Sabrina, you don't wanna rely
on undo spells.

03:11.730 --> 03:13.439
It's not in the spirit of magic.

03:13.607 --> 03:16.098
You really have to get it exactly right
the first time.

03:16.275 --> 03:18.351
Otherwise,
there may be side effects.

03:18.527 --> 03:21.529
I remember one time,
I was making rum balls and I got tired,

03:21.696 --> 03:24.187
so I made
a make-everything-round spell.

03:24.365 --> 03:26.903
Well, let's just say you can thank me
for Columbus Day.

03:27.075 --> 03:29.033
I'll be careful.

03:29.202 --> 03:32.820
I don't have time to think of a spell
to get rid of these wrinkles. Help.

03:32.996 --> 03:36.330
We think that outfit
will serve as a helpful reminder.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.041
I like her best.

03:39.876 --> 03:41.870
- Hey.
- Hey, how can you stand it?

03:42.045 --> 03:44.750
- The school is freezing.
- Oh, yeah.

03:44.922 --> 03:47.164
Guess I'm too miserable
to be miserable.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.176
My Uncle Lloyd's coming
to the football game on Friday.

03:50.343 --> 03:51.837
Family members coming
to cheer you on.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.921
- It sounds terrible.
- It is terrible.

03:54.096 --> 03:58.046
I can just hear my dad now:
"Lloyd's three boys are first-string."

03:58.224 --> 03:59.469
I never get to play.

03:59.641 --> 04:01.599
Sure you do,
that time we were up by 53.

04:01.768 --> 04:04.888
Just once I'd like to start
and shut Uncle Lloyd up.

04:05.062 --> 04:07.471
And his two sons
who can form sentences.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.890
Well, <i>maybe this Friday
You'll start the game</i>

04:10.066 --> 04:11.975
<i>And Uncle Lloyd
Will leave in shame</i>

04:12.151 --> 04:13.812
Why are you talking in rhyme?

04:14.570 --> 04:16.396
Kinkle, you're starting on Friday.

04:16.571 --> 04:18.730
- I am?
- You are?

04:18.906 --> 04:21.195
Well, look at that.

04:21.366 --> 04:23.241
I love this carpet.

04:23.410 --> 04:25.118
Yeah, this old thing
is gonna go perfectly

04:25.286 --> 04:27.030
with the new stuff we made look old.

04:29.289 --> 04:31.366
Hey, Val, look.
The Slicery's under new management.

04:31.541 --> 04:33.119
Wow, that's the first time this month.

04:33.292 --> 04:35.416
And they're looking for people
to work after school.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.044
- We should get jobs.
- You think?

04:37.211 --> 04:39.786
Yeah, maybe we could
save enough money to buy a car.

04:39.964 --> 04:43.380
Or maybe our parents
will get so sick of driving us to work

04:43.550 --> 04:45.092
that they'll buy us cars.

04:45.259 --> 04:46.719
- It's win-win.
- All right, I'm in.

04:46.886 --> 04:49.637
But I gotta warn you,
I haven't had much luck with jobs.

04:49.804 --> 04:52.640
When I was a camp counsellor,
they fired me after two days.

04:52.807 --> 04:54.052
They didn't give you a chance.

04:54.224 --> 04:55.969
- They didn't even get to know you.
- Yeah.

04:56.143 --> 04:58.052
And they eventually
found those kids.

04:59.604 --> 05:00.636
Hey.

05:02.022 --> 05:03.600
Whoa,
didn't mean to make you explode.

05:03.774 --> 05:06.395
I think this cold weather's
giving me the flu.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.442
I told you to bundle up for math.

05:09.028 --> 05:11.945
Coach finally gives me a chance
to start, and now this.

05:12.363 --> 05:16.942
I can hear my dad now,
"Your nose runs faster than you do."

05:17.493 --> 05:18.821
See you.

05:19.577 --> 05:23.361
Poor Harvey. Feel better.
And you will.

05:23.538 --> 05:27.666
<i>No spells at school unless I gotta
And I do, so make it hotter</i>

05:32.128 --> 05:35.793
Well, that concludes your orientation
to the Slicery.

05:35.964 --> 05:37.294
I'm Mrs. Popowski.

05:37.466 --> 05:40.633
If you have any problems,
my office is always open.

05:40.802 --> 05:43.553
It's between the fryer and the wall.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.630
Mrs. Popowski,
there's a mistake on my nametag.

05:45.806 --> 05:49.222
- My name is Sabrina, not Salinas.
- Live with it.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.060
Yeah, and my name is Valerie,
not Fred.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.766
When I said "problems,"
I meant things like:

05:54.938 --> 05:57.689
"My hand is caught
in the meatball maker."

05:58.816 --> 06:00.559
Okay, Val,
I'll do the dough and the sauce,

06:00.733 --> 06:02.442
- and you do the toppings.
- Check.

06:04.820 --> 06:06.481
Slicery.

06:06.655 --> 06:10.783
Okay, that's a large pizza,
extra anchovies.

06:10.950 --> 06:14.152
Hold the crust. Hold the sauce.

06:14.327 --> 06:17.494
Hold the cheese.
Salem, quit fooling around.

06:19.248 --> 06:23.032
Crank call. Okay. Medium cheese.

06:23.209 --> 06:26.411
- Medium cheese. Check.
- Crust.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.711
Sauce.

06:30.548 --> 06:32.257
Cheese.

06:34.801 --> 06:36.510
Oven.

06:37.469 --> 06:40.044
- Check.
- We're a well-oiled machine.

06:40.222 --> 06:43.424
- Okay. Large pepperoni.
- Large pepperoni. Check.

06:43.599 --> 06:45.972
Crust. Sauce.

06:47.561 --> 06:49.020
Pepperoni.

06:49.854 --> 06:51.230
Cheese. Oh, no.

06:51.397 --> 06:53.686
That was supposed to be cheese,
pepperoni.

06:53.857 --> 06:57.392
Okay, large, extra cheese,
half mushroom.

06:57.568 --> 07:00.570
Crust. Sauce.

07:00.738 --> 07:03.940
Things are gonna start hopping.
Weight Watchers meeting just let out.

07:04.365 --> 07:06.073
I'll help.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.951
Think that'll melt down?

07:10.953 --> 07:14.037
- There. Perfect.
- I don't believe it.

07:14.205 --> 07:17.077
You've taken a beautiful rug
and put it in the worst place ever.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.958
Well, where would you put it?

07:22.587 --> 07:25.161
- There. Perfect.
- Yes, I see.

07:25.339 --> 07:28.708
That is perfect,
if we had our eyes gouged out.

07:33.512 --> 07:35.588
I need a medium,
half sausage, half pepperoni,

07:35.764 --> 07:38.801
quarter mushroom, quarter anchovy,
extra cheese.

07:39.933 --> 07:42.556
Val, could you get that? Valerie?

07:42.728 --> 07:45.266
Val, we have to
get these pizzas finished now.

07:45.438 --> 07:47.229
- Am I moving?
- No.

07:47.397 --> 07:49.023
How about now?

07:49.191 --> 07:51.978
- Somebody's gonna get fired.
- Oh, gosh.

07:52.151 --> 07:54.560
This is faster than it happened
at camp.

07:55.112 --> 07:57.271
<i>I can't tell the future
That would make me omniscient</i>

07:57.447 --> 08:00.020
<i>But something bad's gonna happen
Unless Val's more efficient</i>

08:00.199 --> 08:02.358
Okay, that's medium,
half sausage, half pepperoni,

08:02.534 --> 08:04.907
quarter mushroom, quarter anchovy,
extra cheese.

08:05.078 --> 08:06.656
Check.

08:06.829 --> 08:08.027
Okay, the inert gases

08:08.205 --> 08:14.325
are neon, argon, krypton, leon?

08:15.377 --> 08:16.457
Leon?

08:16.628 --> 08:19.713
Boy, public schools
have really gone downhill.

08:19.881 --> 08:22.835
Hi, how you been? I've been fine.
Let's get this quiz over with.

08:23.258 --> 08:26.959
The fine art of conversation lives.
It's an easy one.

08:27.136 --> 08:30.470
- Just clean up your room.
- It is clean.

08:31.515 --> 08:32.924
Fine.

08:33.099 --> 08:35.139
<i>Here's a quiz I know I'll ace</i>

08:35.308 --> 08:37.101
<i>Put everything back
In its rightful place</i>

08:41.563 --> 08:43.272
Hey, that's my diary.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.857
And I was just getting
to the awkward teenage years.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.774
Well, that was so easy,
I almost feel guilty taking an A.

08:50.946 --> 08:53.153
Well, then this
will make you feel a lot better.

08:53.323 --> 08:55.031
- You failed.
- What?

08:55.199 --> 08:57.607
You were only to clean your room,
and you "put things back"

08:57.784 --> 08:58.816
where they belong.

08:58.993 --> 09:00.738
That was a very sloppy spell.

09:00.912 --> 09:03.237
With good results.
The room's clean and I busted Salem.

09:03.414 --> 09:05.822
Listen to the man.
It was a sloppy spell.

09:06.666 --> 09:09.621
Clean up your spells.

09:11.837 --> 09:14.125
I still say it was a fine incantation.

09:14.296 --> 09:16.124
Now, talk me
through this kissing game,

09:16.298 --> 09:18.209
Seven Minutes in Heaven?

09:22.220 --> 09:24.260
Wow, it's hot in here.

09:24.430 --> 09:27.134
The boiler must be broken.

09:27.932 --> 09:29.890
- What are you doing in my locker?
- Sweating.

09:30.059 --> 09:32.550
Somebody left a heat spell running.

09:32.728 --> 09:35.728
- Uh-oh. That'd be me.
- I told you to be more precise.

09:35.896 --> 09:37.937
No problem. I'll fix it with an undo.
Let's see:

09:38.107 --> 09:41.143
<i>It's hot in here
It's making us perspire</i>

09:41.317 --> 09:43.725
<i>Undo the spell
Or the straits will be dire.</i>

09:45.154 --> 09:46.697
Aah! What's going on?

09:46.864 --> 09:48.903
I've taken away
your undoing privileges,

09:49.073 --> 09:53.367
partly to teach you a valuable lesson,
partly fun for me.

09:53.535 --> 09:55.078
How about this for fun?

09:58.039 --> 10:00.446
Auditioning for <i>Stomp.</i>

10:00.623 --> 10:02.582
So you can see by these projections,
Mrs. Quick,

10:02.751 --> 10:05.158
we can easily put out two editions
of the paper each week

10:05.335 --> 10:08.171
rather than one, and we can do it
for 38 percent less money.

10:08.337 --> 10:09.667
Good work, Val.

10:09.839 --> 10:12.046
That's an excellent use
of your resources.

10:12.507 --> 10:16.885
- Check.
- Not that we need two papers a week.

10:18.304 --> 10:21.221
You see that? The efficiency spell
I put on Val is working out great.

10:21.389 --> 10:22.421
Oh, it looks good now,

10:22.599 --> 10:26.134
and that heat spell looked good too,
yesterday.

10:26.352 --> 10:28.310
Ow. Ow.

10:29.854 --> 10:33.188
- Harvey, what's the matter?
- I just burned my hand on my locker.

10:33.357 --> 10:35.018
Oh, great,
I have enough trouble catching

10:35.192 --> 10:36.521
with two good hands.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.607
Now, how do you expect me
to fix all this without an undo spell?

10:39.779 --> 10:41.570
That's the part that's fun for me.

10:42.739 --> 10:43.938
Think, Sabrina, think.

10:44.115 --> 10:46.322
Okay, first let's take care
of the temperature.

10:46.492 --> 10:48.402
<i>It's hot in here
The sweat's a-pooling</i>

10:48.577 --> 10:50.819
<i>So let's get down
To some serious cooling</i>

10:52.372 --> 10:55.871
Cool. Okay, now Harvey.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.073
I got it.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.910
<i>The team doesn't need
A Harvey that's tame</i>

10:59.085 --> 11:00.995
<i>So make him worthy
Of the hall of fame</i>

11:07.007 --> 11:09.167
See? All done and no undo.

11:09.343 --> 11:11.798
Oh, yes, but there was a hot front,

11:11.969 --> 11:16.715
which is now meeting a cold front,
resulting in an occluded front.

11:16.890 --> 11:20.306
- Oh, no. That means--
- Yep. Showers.

11:23.019 --> 11:27.681
Everyone outside,
where it's not raining.

11:28.315 --> 11:29.894
I meant to do that.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.103
And that too.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.441
Come on. Admit it.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.194
That rug would look better
in my room.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.985
Please, that rug is an object of taste
and refinement.

11:45.161 --> 11:46.194
Your room is decorated

11:46.371 --> 11:48.696
with stuff a clown
takes out of his pockets at night.

11:51.749 --> 11:52.948
It's gone.

11:53.418 --> 11:55.043
You've put it in your room,
haven't you?

11:55.211 --> 11:57.002
I most certainly did not.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.211
Well, it's gotta be around here
somewhere, then.

11:59.381 --> 12:00.875
Psst, psst.

12:01.549 --> 12:03.626
Tell you what happened to it
for a belly rub.

12:04.175 --> 12:05.884
Hi. Gotta go to work.
Forgot my nametag.

12:06.052 --> 12:09.006
The ulprit-cay
just walked into the oyer-fay.

12:09.179 --> 12:10.212
- What?
- Sabrina did it

12:10.389 --> 12:12.133
with an everything-in-its-place spell.

12:12.306 --> 12:13.588
They threatened me.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.471
- What did I do?
- Made our rug disappear.

12:16.643 --> 12:18.553
Sabrina, normally
I don't advocate undo spells,

12:18.729 --> 12:20.188
but I want that rug back.

12:20.355 --> 12:22.893
I'd love to undo it, but:

12:23.065 --> 12:25.983
- If you can undo this, I can undo that.
- We can't undo that.

12:26.151 --> 12:27.860
There's no undoing a no-can-undo.

12:28.028 --> 12:30.519
It's a triple negative.
It's magically ungrammatical.

12:30.696 --> 12:34.610
Sorry. I gotta get to work.
We're introducing garlic sticks.

12:34.782 --> 12:36.527
Now how are we gonna
get our rug back?

12:36.701 --> 12:38.076
Excuse me.

12:38.243 --> 12:40.284
There's someone
whose belly earned a rubbing.

12:40.454 --> 12:42.078
Oh, I know.

12:42.246 --> 12:46.410
<i>Everyone inside is beginning to bug
Help them find their stupid lost rug</i>

12:46.583 --> 12:47.912
Close enough.

12:48.084 --> 12:51.370
Come on, you can't
vanish and rub at the same time?

12:52.212 --> 12:55.213
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

12:55.381 --> 12:57.505
But I bet I know who's to blame.

12:57.675 --> 12:59.300
- Sabrina.
- Sabrina.

12:59.468 --> 13:00.879
Oh, I'm sure she heard that.

13:01.053 --> 13:04.338
- Salem, that's not helping.
- Hey, there's your rug.

13:04.513 --> 13:06.802
- That is our rug.
- That was helping.

13:07.474 --> 13:11.721
You know, this place reminds me
of Merlin's old weekend castle.

13:11.894 --> 13:13.519
Oh, man.
You guys had a vicious breakup.

13:13.687 --> 13:14.802
That was awful.

13:14.979 --> 13:18.065
By the time it was over,
the only thing I liked about him was--

13:18.232 --> 13:19.643
--this rug.

13:19.816 --> 13:22.143
This is Merlin's castle.
We better get out of here.

13:22.319 --> 13:25.154
Yeah. For a guy who wears a dress,
he's a real misogynist.

13:30.492 --> 13:32.983
Leaving? So soon?

13:33.160 --> 13:36.362
- Hi, Merl.
- Zelda Spellman.

13:36.537 --> 13:38.911
I haven't seen you in 500 years.

13:39.082 --> 13:42.498
So, what you been up to?

13:42.668 --> 13:46.119
Oh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
And you?

13:46.671 --> 13:47.999
Uh...

13:48.171 --> 13:50.081
Waiting for revenge.

13:51.383 --> 13:55.215
- Why don't you stay a while?
- How long a while?

13:55.386 --> 13:58.755
Until you love me again.

14:00.722 --> 14:02.134
How about if I love you?

14:02.307 --> 14:05.474
Or me? I can be quite tender.

14:06.018 --> 14:07.846
I feel like we've made
a hundred pizzas today.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.013
Seventy-four.

14:10.188 --> 14:12.856
Seventy-five.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.266
- Check.
- Fred.

14:21.488 --> 14:23.529
Sabrina, this is hard for me.
I'm your friend,

14:23.699 --> 14:26.272
- but also your supervisor.
- When did you become supervisor?

14:26.450 --> 14:27.566
- Just now.
- Way to go.

14:27.743 --> 14:30.412
I've already celebrated.
Who arranged these pepperonis?

14:30.578 --> 14:31.860
The pepperoni fairy.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.612
Back when I was on the line,
I liked to remember the three P's:

14:34.790 --> 14:37.033
precision, placement, promptness.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.910
- You forgot "pannoying."
- You're on your ten-minute break.

14:41.087 --> 14:42.747
Go.

15:17.281 --> 15:20.732
- Spellman.
- Sorry, I must have dozed off.

15:20.908 --> 15:22.901
And you extended your break
by 55 seconds.

15:23.076 --> 15:26.363
I'll make it up at the end of the day.
I'll run into the walk-in cooler.

15:26.538 --> 15:30.121
That would be fine if you were still
part of the Slicery, but you're fired.

15:30.291 --> 15:31.869
Look at that.
I gave myself two minutes

15:32.042 --> 15:33.537
to dismiss you, and it only took one.

15:33.710 --> 15:34.874
Check-a-roonie.

15:35.544 --> 15:37.372
The garlic sticks bite.

15:39.422 --> 15:43.337
- We need a plan.
- How about we weep uncontrollably?

15:45.344 --> 15:47.005
If only we could get a message
to Sabrina,

15:47.179 --> 15:48.554
she could reverse her spell.

15:48.721 --> 15:50.928
But we can't,
so we have to work on Merlin.

15:51.098 --> 15:54.265
Now, one thing I remember about him
is he doesn't like to be challenged.

15:54.434 --> 15:55.466
That's right.

15:55.644 --> 15:57.553
You once questioned a word he used
in Scrabble,

15:57.728 --> 16:01.227
and he turned you into an oryx,
which, as I recall, was also the word.

16:01.397 --> 16:03.272
Exactly.

16:04.233 --> 16:07.899
Maybe if we're nice to Merlin,
he'll feel sorry for us and let us go.

16:08.070 --> 16:11.236
- So let's not antagonise him.
- Good plan.

16:12.365 --> 16:15.235
- Dead magician walking.
- How is everyone?

16:16.493 --> 16:19.066
- Got everything you need?
- No, no, we're fine.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.530
Now that I think about it,
I could use a little freedom.

16:23.957 --> 16:27.290
So have you decided
to love me again?

16:27.459 --> 16:28.871
I'd rather lick a dead seal.

16:29.044 --> 16:31.120
Am I the only one
who remembers the plan?

16:32.088 --> 16:34.543
- Excuse me--
- Oh, shut up, conehead.

16:35.048 --> 16:36.958
It can't be done.

16:37.133 --> 16:40.549
It's a shame you've decided now
to be so nasty,

16:40.719 --> 16:43.886
just when I was about to feed you.

16:44.055 --> 16:46.380
- You're not gonna feed us?
- That's right.

16:46.556 --> 16:48.052
And they look mighty hungry,

16:48.225 --> 16:51.724
so I'd sleep with one eye open, cat.

16:54.229 --> 16:56.353
You're not gonna be able
to keep us here forever.

16:56.523 --> 16:58.562
My niece, Sabrina's,
gonna find out we're missing,

16:58.732 --> 17:00.975
and she's gonna come after us
with a lot of help.

17:01.151 --> 17:03.987
And drunken bouncers.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.727
Oh, I'm so scared.

17:06.905 --> 17:09.444
Maybe I ought to send you back.

17:09.616 --> 17:13.910
Wait a minute.
I think I got a better idea.

17:15.203 --> 17:16.864
You're never gonna
believe what happened.

17:17.038 --> 17:18.865
My friend--
I mean soon-to-be ex-friend, Val.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.867
--fired me.
And I know what you're gonna say:

17:21.040 --> 17:23.531
"Sloppy spells, more specific:"
So please don't.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.498
I'm pooped. I'm going to bed.
Thanks for listening, guys.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.794
Guess I won't be needing this
anymore.

17:31.465 --> 17:33.542
Yes, that was a better idea.

17:33.718 --> 17:37.585
You can always count on a teenager
to be self-absorbed.

17:37.762 --> 17:41.677
Attica! Attica! Attica!

17:41.849 --> 17:44.684
Please, I'm trying to concentrate
on a new escape plan.

17:44.851 --> 17:47.307
Well, why don't you try
coming up with some decorating ideas

17:47.478 --> 17:50.930
for this cell,
because we're never leaving?

17:51.106 --> 17:53.312
I've got it, the perfect escape plan.
It's so simple.

17:53.482 --> 17:55.393
I can't believe
I haven't thought of it before.

17:55.568 --> 17:57.395
- What is it?
- You marry Merlin.

17:57.986 --> 18:00.654
What do you think about
painting these bars Navajo White?

18:01.196 --> 18:03.190
Come on, Sabrina.

18:03.991 --> 18:06.482
No time for breakfast.
I'm late and I have to try to fix Val.

18:06.659 --> 18:09.945
I can't believe I put a spell on her.
I'm such a dummy.

18:10.746 --> 18:15.289
Sabrina's never gonna save us.
There's no hope. None.

18:15.458 --> 18:17.616
And the worst part is,
we're not gonna die.

18:17.792 --> 18:21.126
We're gonna live here forever
without hope.

18:21.295 --> 18:22.541
No hope.

18:27.216 --> 18:28.463
Uh-oh.

18:28.801 --> 18:31.589
I bet I had something to do with this.

18:35.598 --> 18:37.923
- Hot news coming through.
- Hey, Val, got a sec?

18:38.099 --> 18:40.223
No, I have to get out the next edition
of the paper.

18:40.393 --> 18:42.552
By typing continuously,
I can make it a daily.

18:42.728 --> 18:44.271
You look like you haven't slept.

18:44.438 --> 18:46.265
If I sleep,
I won't have time to learn opera.

18:46.439 --> 18:49.108
- Can we talk?
- Friendship is inefficient use of time.

18:49.275 --> 18:51.731
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through, sorry.

18:52.110 --> 18:53.143
Harvey?

18:53.320 --> 18:56.321
I think I might have overdone it
with the pull-ups.

18:57.865 --> 19:00.700
I can take care of this. Somehow.

19:00.867 --> 19:04.947
- Blizzard!
- Oh, no. Think fast.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.450
<i>Block that snow from pouring out</i>

19:06.621 --> 19:08.330
<i>And stick something in
That spewing spout</i>

19:11.541 --> 19:13.037
Help, quizmaster.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.540
Are you sure you need help?
I mean, like you said,

19:16.712 --> 19:18.373
there's nothing wrong
with inexact spells

19:18.547 --> 19:20.339
as long as they get the job done.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.259
I got it wrong, very wrong.
It was all wrong.

19:23.425 --> 19:26.760
It was a correctness shutout.
By the way, did I say I was wrong?

19:26.929 --> 19:29.171
<i>Because she admitted
She'd been wrong and a lout</i>

19:29.347 --> 19:31.341
<i>Every spell she incanted
Will be undone</i>

19:31.515 --> 19:34.054
<i>Including several ones
She doesn't even know about</i>

19:35.143 --> 19:37.979
They just have to be exact,
not pretty.

19:40.021 --> 19:41.517
- You wanna shut him up?
- Let's do it together.

19:41.690 --> 19:42.971
Who's going to share--?

19:43.692 --> 19:44.723
Cool.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.858
So all I had to do
was admit I was wrong?

19:47.027 --> 19:48.438
And?

19:48.611 --> 19:50.735
And that I have to be more careful
with my magic?

19:50.905 --> 19:52.104
And?

19:52.281 --> 19:54.073
And I can learn something
from my elders?

19:54.241 --> 19:55.357
And?

19:55.534 --> 19:57.941
And that the barn door
on your ski suit is open?

19:58.619 --> 19:59.949
See you.

20:03.540 --> 20:04.999
You'll never believe the day I had.

20:05.165 --> 20:07.574
I've learned so much.
I'll never do an inexact spell again.

20:07.751 --> 20:10.871
In fact, I'm gonna go upstairs and
clean my room the old-fashioned way.

20:11.713 --> 20:13.504
We've gotta send something
to the quizmaster

20:13.672 --> 20:15.713
for undoing Sabrina's spell
and saving us.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.625
He strikes me
as a cheese-log person.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.344
I am forever grateful.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.429
I don't think I've ever been
in a more terrifying situation.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.890
And yet,
I remembered to grab the rug.

20:28.058 --> 20:30.098
And I learned a valuable lesson.

20:30.268 --> 20:32.807
Whenever there's a crisis,
I can depend on you guys

20:32.979 --> 20:34.770
to turn on me.

20:35.397 --> 20:40.308
Come on. We're sorry.
How about that belly rub?

20:40.985 --> 20:43.441
I'm so cheap.

20:45.196 --> 20:46.940
Lovely.

20:48.824 --> 20:50.568
So how'd it go at the Slicery
this weekend?

20:50.742 --> 20:51.774
Terrible.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.577
I fell apart
and overcooked some pizzas.

20:53.745 --> 20:56.200
Once the fire department was gone
and Mrs. Popowski came to,

20:56.371 --> 20:57.404
she asked me to leave.

20:57.581 --> 21:00.617
- How'd you get fired?
- Well, it's a long story.

21:00.791 --> 21:04.457
Hey, Harvey, you really bulked down
over the weekend.

21:04.628 --> 21:07.830
- So how'd the game go?
- Great. I caught a pass.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.923
And if it had been inbounds,
it would've been great.

21:11.090 --> 21:13.499
Did anyone bring an umbrella?
I hear it's supposed to rain.

21:13.676 --> 21:16.594
Not indoors. They fixed the roof.
Let's never talk about it again.

21:16.762 --> 21:18.755
You skipped your breakfast again,
didn't you?

21:18.931 --> 21:20.093
Yeah.

21:20.264 --> 21:23.514
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.
I'm gonna put my books away.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.677
Hey. Quizmaster,
what are you still doing in there?

21:27.853 --> 21:31.021
My apartment's being
painted. I needed a place to crash.

21:31.190 --> 21:34.107
Well, just don't get cheese log
all over my books.
