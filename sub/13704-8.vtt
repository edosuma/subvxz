WEBVTT

00:48.415 --> 00:52.485
What a great song.
I wouldn't mind singing it myself.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.021
-Wasn't it a great song?
-Yes.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.601
I heard there's a reason
that Spirit of Kirin Art School

01:08.668 --> 01:11.071
wanted to play on Hug the Radio.

01:15.775 --> 01:16.643
We're here today,

01:17.210 --> 01:21.247
hoping that we could bring back those
who left us.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.586
When I was caught up in an assault case,

01:27.821 --> 01:33.326
Principal Ju Jeong-wan saved me
by paying the ten-million-won settlement.

01:35.528 --> 01:38.731
It was also Principal Ju

01:39.532 --> 01:41.601
who taught us to dream

01:42.969 --> 01:44.370
and to sing for our dreams.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.775
For us,

01:49.442 --> 01:50.477
our only captain

01:51.678 --> 01:53.880
is Principal Ju Jeong-wan.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.490
Principal Ju.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.493
We'll forgive you for betraying us,

02:07.293 --> 02:08.428
so please come back.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.341
Why is he being so mushy?

02:22.542 --> 02:24.677
This is embarrassing.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.148
Why are you embarrassed?
I'm jealous of you.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.352
I've made up my mind.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.523
I'm going to become a captain
just like you.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.259
What has gotten into everyone?

02:59.112 --> 03:01.481
-What are you doing?
-Can't you see?

03:01.548 --> 03:03.516
We're hanging yellow ribbons.

03:04.717 --> 03:05.785
What for?

03:07.487 --> 03:09.022
Was Principal Ju that great?

03:09.722 --> 03:11.958
I don't know. I didn't really like him.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.128
Me neither. He was always nagging us.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.497
He always picked on me,
calling me a fake shaman.

03:18.164 --> 03:20.099
Then why are you hanging the ribbons?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.535
He grew on me, I guess.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.504
Were it not for him,

03:24.571 --> 03:26.172
I would have left this school
a long time ago.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.442
All through my three years of being here,

03:29.509 --> 03:31.644
he nagged me nonstop
about the importance of school.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.448
I'm still here all thanks to him.

03:36.683 --> 03:37.884
So he's a good guy.

03:38.751 --> 03:39.586
Is he?

03:40.486 --> 03:41.654
I suppose he is.

03:42.021 --> 03:46.092
He's way better than you-know-who
that always makes students feel worthless.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.261
Right, and that's not all.

03:48.461 --> 03:51.564
He separated us into two classes
and sent us to boot camp.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.067
He's a nasty pig.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.768
He's not that bad, okay?

03:56.603 --> 03:59.239
Why are you taking the director's side?

03:59.472 --> 04:01.808
You haven't experienced
the full extent of his meanness.

04:01.874 --> 04:04.277
You'll understand us sooner or later.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.047
-What the...
-Hey!

04:08.715 --> 04:09.782
-Hey!
-Hey!

04:11.284 --> 04:12.318
How odd.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.621
Who knew anyone could like the director?

04:29.235 --> 04:30.703
Who the...

04:35.475 --> 04:39.145
I heard you worked with the band
in order to impress Mr. Lee.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.956
You succumbed to those stronger than you
and used your students.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.991
Have you always been like this?

04:52.058 --> 04:54.227
I didn't use my students.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.095
I merely saw it as an extension
of the classroom...

04:56.529 --> 04:59.932
Didn't you feel anything
watching their performance last night?

05:01.301 --> 05:06.039
I've decided to treat my students equally
regardless of their competence level.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.444
I'll reach out to each student
just like Principal Ju does,

05:12.278 --> 05:14.480
so you should get your act together too.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.949
Why are you being like this to me?

05:17.984 --> 05:19.886
What did Mr. Lee say?

05:20.386 --> 05:21.354
What do you mean?

05:21.921 --> 05:23.189
He hasn't said anything to you?

05:24.691 --> 05:27.427
The band openly criticized Mr. Lee
on stage.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.228
Isn't it odd that
he hasn't said anything to you?

05:29.729 --> 05:31.097
Knowing how he is,

05:31.164 --> 05:35.234
shouldn't he have threatened
to expel Yu-jin and fire you?

05:35.301 --> 05:36.302
Fire me?

05:37.036 --> 05:40.106
No. I can't get fired. I really can't.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.575
What are you doing here?

05:50.717 --> 05:53.519
Principal Ju, are you back?

06:05.698 --> 06:06.833
Don't you have a class to teach?

06:07.834 --> 06:09.602
-Go and prep for your class.
-Okay.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.880
Wait.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.149
Here. This...

06:27.153 --> 06:28.788
I sold the fried chicken joint.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.657
As you said, doing two jobs
was too much for me.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.429
So what made you decide to come back?

06:38.531 --> 06:40.800
Well, you know...

06:41.601 --> 06:44.103
It was hard being away from the kids.

06:45.338 --> 06:49.108
I never liked nagging them
or having them badmouth me,

06:50.009 --> 06:51.844
but I must have enjoyed
listening to them sing

06:51.911 --> 06:56.382
and watching them work
toward their dreams.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.485
Thanks for letting me come back.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.656
I'm sorry you returned
as a regular teacher, not the principal.

07:03.723 --> 07:04.557
Don't be.

07:05.391 --> 07:06.893
I'll do my best

07:07.593 --> 07:09.996
to help the students realize their dreams.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.932
I won't keep you from doing your best,

07:14.133 --> 07:15.535
but you have to do well.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.870
Then fire me again. Go ahead.

07:23.976 --> 07:24.944
Hey, thanks.

07:25.845 --> 07:26.712
Thanks a lot.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.634
Good grief.

07:49.368 --> 07:51.337
Where did they even hear about
the yellow ribbon story?

08:00.780 --> 08:03.749
There was an especially
big and ugly duckling.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.220
Just because he looked different,

08:08.054 --> 08:10.790
he was bullied and ostracized
by the other ducklings.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.358
What is this?

08:12.425 --> 08:13.392
Did she gather us here

08:14.227 --> 08:16.329
first thing in the morning
to tell us a fairy tale?

08:16.796 --> 08:19.265
You, grumbling student.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.901
Pardon? Yes?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.071
What happened to the ugly duckling?

08:28.774 --> 08:32.979
Well, I never went to kindergarten.

08:35.281 --> 08:36.148
He's so funny.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.418
Does anyone know?

08:39.852 --> 08:40.686
Me!

08:41.654 --> 08:44.457
The ugly duckling turned out to be a swan.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.293
So, in the end,
he flies high into the sky.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.228
That's right.

08:49.729 --> 08:52.231
If the ugly duckling never found out
he was a swan,

08:53.165 --> 08:55.668
he would have been taunted
and harassed all his life.

08:55.968 --> 09:00.139
He would have died
without ever having taken to the sky.

09:01.207 --> 09:05.111
Why does she make everything
so morbid in front of the kids?

09:05.578 --> 09:07.980
Is she implying that our kids
are ugly ducklings?

09:08.514 --> 09:09.782
That sugar cube...

09:10.016 --> 09:13.886
Unaware that the ugly duckling was a swan,

09:15.888 --> 09:19.492
the other ducklings would have continued
to bully and pick on him.

09:20.993 --> 09:25.364
That is what's happening
to students in the low-level class.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.306
But I found a swan
among the ugly ducklings.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.809
Jin Yu-jin.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.748
You've been chosen
as Kirin's first super idol.

09:46.218 --> 09:47.320
A round of applause, everyone.

09:52.892 --> 09:57.563
He has a truly charismatic stage presence,

09:57.930 --> 10:00.633
as well as exceptional singing
and songwriting skills.

10:01.867 --> 10:06.005
I saw him in a new light
after the performance last night.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.842
As the first super idol,

10:10.376 --> 10:14.180
he'll receive intensive personal training
as per Oz's new singer training program.

10:15.448 --> 10:20.052
Although you are separated
into accelerated and low-level classes,

10:21.621 --> 10:25.324
the first super idol has been chosen
from the low-level class.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.694
Accelerated class,

10:30.496 --> 10:31.998
you should be nervous.

10:34.533 --> 10:35.534
Low-level class,

10:36.736 --> 10:38.137
keep your heads held high.

10:44.443 --> 10:47.013
-This is so cool.
-You're so lucky!

10:48.581 --> 10:50.616
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.284
You're really awesome.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.720
What about the rest of us who performed?

11:03.029 --> 11:03.863
Yes?

11:04.764 --> 11:05.965
What is this?

11:06.232 --> 11:08.067
You never discussed any of it with me.

11:08.768 --> 11:09.602
I did.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.304
I even introduced you to Producer Shin.

11:13.272 --> 11:17.710
We'll make you, the rebel of this school,
into Korea's top star.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.681
Kirin's super idol, Jin Yu-jin.

11:22.715 --> 11:23.949
What do you think? Do you like it?

11:24.350 --> 11:26.652
Who says I want to become an idol?

11:29.388 --> 11:31.691
Mr. Shin, please take good care of him.

11:40.466 --> 11:41.734
Jin Yu-jin,

11:42.068 --> 11:45.404
you're a good singer,
you can play almost any instrument,

11:46.038 --> 11:47.907
and your songwriting isn't too bad either.

11:51.010 --> 11:54.680
I was wondering why you would
waste your time in this shitty school.

11:54.980 --> 11:55.981
I told you.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.484
I want to be a rocker.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.087
Rockers don't become trainees.

12:01.153 --> 12:03.089
I took your word for it at first,

12:05.091 --> 12:07.026
but then I stumbled upon
this newspaper article.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.166
CHILD SUPERSTAR, JIN YU-JIN, QUITS SHOWBIZ
AFTER HIS PARENTS' DIVORCE

12:17.236 --> 12:19.638
Why did you have to negotiate
his contract like that?

12:19.705 --> 12:21.874
Do you even know anything about contracts?

12:22.274 --> 12:25.077
Do you know how much we lose
when you handle Yu-jin's contract?

12:25.144 --> 12:27.613
-If you are so...
-Everything on your student record.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.317
From your address
to parental contact information is fake.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.854
The rocker thing is just a cover
for you to seek refuge at Kirin.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.989
You didn't want to become famous again.

12:37.790 --> 12:41.060
When you were young,
people used your fame to earn money.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.830
The adults fought
to get that money for themselves.

12:45.631 --> 12:50.102
The popularity and the money
finally led to your parents' divorce.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.339
You must be confusing me
with someone else.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.246
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.449
I thought you were an orphan.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.990
But the address listed doesn't even exist,

13:11.590 --> 13:12.892
and the phone numbers

13:13.826 --> 13:15.628
you listed for your parents
are out of service.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.332
-Who knew you had such a past?
-Who do you think you are?

13:20.399 --> 13:24.336
You can run away from the pain
you experienced as a child,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.739
but the wound won't go away.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.811
If you're hesitant to make a debut
because your parents might find you,

13:32.878 --> 13:34.046
we will sort things out for you.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.148
As I already told you,

13:37.716 --> 13:39.885
it's just that I don't want
to be a teen idol.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.122
No matter how you blackmail me,

13:45.157 --> 13:47.259
I won't change my mind.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.096
Don't you want to know

13:53.165 --> 13:55.067
how your parents are doing?

14:05.644 --> 14:06.712
In the end,

14:08.347 --> 14:09.515
you'll give in.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.853
Hello. I'm Shin Jae-in.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.325
-It's him.
-Who's that?

14:20.793 --> 14:22.761
A producer with a magic touch.

14:23.462 --> 14:24.997
"Magic touch"?

14:25.397 --> 14:31.103
Whoever he chooses becomes a world star.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.505
World star? He's that important?

14:33.839 --> 14:36.075
-I didn't know.
-I was given a special mission.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.246
I was asked to find promising students
in Kirin Art School

14:40.613 --> 14:42.448
and cultivate them into super idols.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.451
As you know,

14:46.051 --> 14:48.020
I don't work with just anyone.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.725
We will be selecting members
for a super idol group

14:53.058 --> 14:54.960
through a series of special missions
and assignments.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.764
Five selected members will join Jin Yu-jin

14:59.164 --> 15:03.168
and come to comprise a super idol group.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.704
Oh, my goodness!

15:06.205 --> 15:07.506
But we're already teen idols.

15:08.607 --> 15:09.808
What about us?

15:10.075 --> 15:11.744
If we can work with Shin Jae-in,

15:12.378 --> 15:14.046
we'll reach a whole new level.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.782
I bet we could top the Billboard Charts.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.551
I'm so excited. This is awesome.

15:20.986 --> 15:24.056
The theme of the first mission
I'm assigning you is "bi."

15:25.291 --> 15:27.359
-"Bi"?
-Your faculty advisors

15:27.426 --> 15:29.561
will divide you into teams.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.366
Each team must prepare a song
and dance relating to the theme.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.502
"Bi"? Could it mean "drizzle"?

15:36.568 --> 15:37.636
-It could mean "rain."
-"Rain"?

15:38.837 --> 15:41.273
Don't you know Rain? Good grief.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.242
The singer.

15:43.709 --> 15:44.677
Rain.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.580
You idiots.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.983
A super idol isn't just a singer.

15:51.317 --> 15:52.918
It's about the process
of becoming an artist.

15:53.919 --> 15:55.387
An attractive artist knows

15:55.854 --> 16:00.025
what the audience wants,
delivers it, and wins them over.

16:00.759 --> 16:01.794
To ensure fairness,

16:02.061 --> 16:04.730
the mission will be evaluated
by your peers

16:05.197 --> 16:07.099
who will vote as audience members.

16:09.168 --> 16:10.002
Everyone.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.638
Do you want to become superstars?

16:13.172 --> 16:14.773
-Yes.
-Yes.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.242
If that's what you want,

16:18.243 --> 16:19.144
come and get it.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.388
Why Jin Yu-jin?

16:31.023 --> 16:32.524
It's true that there was a mishap,

16:33.492 --> 16:35.961
but the one who stole the show
last night wasn't him.

16:37.529 --> 16:38.397
It was me.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.034
If your evaluation was based on
that performance alone,

16:42.201 --> 16:45.070
I think you should have picked me
as the super idol.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.274
If I am given a chance,

16:50.609 --> 16:52.544
I know I can do even better.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.646
That's why we're giving you a chance.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.583
You can audition like everyone else

16:57.649 --> 17:01.086
and secure your place
in the super idol group.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.955
I became famous right after I debuted.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.324
Half of HershE's fans
are actually my fans.

17:06.925 --> 17:09.428
It's obvious that I'm special.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.199
Why do I need to prove myself again?

17:14.266 --> 17:18.437
You've never once proven yourself
with your talent.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.308
What do people associate you with?

17:24.209 --> 17:26.912
A teen idol who can't act.
The pretty face of HershE.

17:28.414 --> 17:29.581
The one with a nasty personality.

17:30.682 --> 17:33.485
How long do you think you'll last
with that pretty face of yours?

17:34.253 --> 17:36.188
On average, teen idols' fame
lasts for about five years.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.624
HershE debuted two years ago.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.492
You have three years left.

17:41.326 --> 17:44.196
The other members can sing,
so they'll go solo.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.198
I'm working hard to change.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.803
I even did a live show last night.

17:51.603 --> 17:52.871
Are you strapped for cash?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.474
Why are you so impatient?

17:58.377 --> 18:00.579
HershE has three years left,

18:00.913 --> 18:03.148
but you have over 50 years ahead of you.

18:06.819 --> 18:10.089
I hope you can prove
just how special you are

18:10.155 --> 18:11.590
through the upcoming audition.

18:14.393 --> 18:15.861
I'm telling you this out of concern.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.738
Yu-jin.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.907
I knew you would do well.

18:28.974 --> 18:32.411
I always told you how much cooler you are
compared to other guys.

18:32.478 --> 18:33.345
Thanks.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.814
We'll be in the same group, right?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.584
But we're roommates.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.853
Now that you're a super idol,

18:41.186 --> 18:43.255
shouldn't you help
your roomies rise to fame?

18:43.989 --> 18:46.225
Gosh, come on!

18:49.361 --> 18:51.396
What's all the fuss
about being a super idol?

18:58.504 --> 18:59.338
I suppose

19:00.205 --> 19:04.309
I am too awesome to be left alone.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.411
What is this?

19:06.845 --> 19:09.481
Are you showing off already?

19:10.582 --> 19:11.950
As a dancer,

19:12.384 --> 19:15.687
I've seen many kids
forget their humble beginnings.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.489
-Nevertheless--
-"Nevertheless"?

19:18.157 --> 19:21.927
I'll let you brag all you want,
so let me in on this.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.462
No. Me first.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.364
Go away.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.634
-By the way...
-Yes?

19:30.702 --> 19:32.070
Have you heard from Hae-seong?

19:33.138 --> 19:35.240
Is Hae-seong all you care about?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.009
You don't even care about me.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.212
Call her.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.548
I tried a few times,
but she didn't pick up.

20:00.499 --> 20:01.800
I want to have a word with you.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.005
Get your hands off me.

20:12.411 --> 20:16.215
Mom, how many times do I have to tell you?
I can't sign with two agencies.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.618
They will really kick me out.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.889
I'll do whatever you tell me to,

20:24.556 --> 20:27.092
so hold off on signing that contract.

20:28.493 --> 20:32.030
Mom, I can't go off on my own.
It would be a disaster.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.702
They're selecting super idols
at my school right now.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.705
I'll be fine if I get chosen,

20:41.006 --> 20:42.107
so just...

20:47.346 --> 20:48.347
I got it.

20:58.056 --> 20:59.091
What do you want?

20:59.591 --> 21:01.426
Don't you have respect
for other people's things?

21:03.195 --> 21:05.564
So you're jealous of me too?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.333
Like being a super idol is all that.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.538
I don't even want to become one,
so it's all yours.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.506
This is so childish.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.742
-What did you say?
-Hey!

21:18.176 --> 21:20.412
How can you cause someone so much grief?

21:21.546 --> 21:23.415
How can you act the way you do?

21:24.316 --> 21:27.619
You pretended to help Hae-seong so that
you could steal her song, didn't you?

21:28.086 --> 21:29.554
I never stole her song.

21:30.989 --> 21:33.091
And what about you?
Didn't your group plagiarize?

21:35.260 --> 21:39.364
Singing someone else's song
without their permission is stealing.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.334
How can you perform
without letting the songwriter know?

21:43.068 --> 21:45.804
How will she feel hearing
other people sing her song

21:46.405 --> 21:48.874
when she never got to sing it herself?

21:52.377 --> 21:55.580
The performance was originally planned
for Hae-seong.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.519
Things went wrong because of Rian.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.255
-Hae-seong was supposed to sing it.
-Don't make excuses.

22:04.189 --> 22:07.592
You used Hae-seong as an excuse last time,
and now you're blaming Rian.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.762
Don't you think
you're the one being childish?

22:21.773 --> 22:24.943
So we sang Shin Hae-seong's song.
What's the big deal?

22:26.611 --> 22:29.181
Why are you getting so riled up
over a mere song of hers?

22:30.549 --> 22:31.416
Do you...

22:32.451 --> 22:33.485
like her?

22:36.088 --> 22:36.922
Yes.

22:37.789 --> 22:38.623
I like her.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.528
What?

22:45.597 --> 22:47.466
Just so you know,

22:48.867 --> 22:50.502
I don't get jealous.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.706
Think what you will.

23:18.964 --> 23:19.898
Hi.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.069
-I need to borrow your car.
-What?

23:24.503 --> 23:26.938
-It won't take long.
-Where are you going?

23:27.506 --> 23:28.673
Going to see Hae-seong again?

23:29.541 --> 23:30.976
You know where she is, right?

23:32.077 --> 23:32.911
Pass the key.

23:34.112 --> 23:34.946
What?

23:42.154 --> 23:44.055
Are you really dating Shin Hae-seong?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.158
Get out.

23:48.026 --> 23:49.327
This is my car.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.230
You can't order anyone around.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.561
What's up with him?

24:26.698 --> 24:29.701
-This is going to be difficult to manage.
-I know, right?

24:29.768 --> 24:30.969
-Darn it.
-It's a real pain.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.139
-Hello.
-Hello.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.340
Please sit down.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.578
You've all selected teams
to mentor, right?

24:40.846 --> 24:42.013
Let's start with Ms. Hyeon.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.017
JB, Si-u, Na-na, Ailee, and Rian.

24:46.184 --> 24:49.955
I'll mentor a team that comprises
I:dn and HershE members.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.590
Don't you think
you're playing it too safe?

24:55.660 --> 24:56.995
I'll take Park Hong-ju, Jeong Ui-bong,

24:57.062 --> 24:59.664
Shin Hae-seong, Park Sun-dong,
and Lee Seul.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.169
Isn't that too reckless a choice?

25:04.436 --> 25:07.138
The point of this audition
is to find students' hidden talents--

25:07.205 --> 25:09.007
I don't need fancy explanations.

25:09.641 --> 25:11.343
Their performance is what matters.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.147
Put Yu-jin on that team.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.917
That might even out
the playing field somewhat.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.153
-Next?
-Right.

25:22.487 --> 25:25.524
Choi Jin-woo, Lee Sang-cheol,
Kang Min-hyeok, Kang Yun-ji...

25:25.590 --> 25:28.260
Didn't Hae-seong transfer
to another school?

25:28.527 --> 25:29.661
I'm bringing her back.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.264
It's my fault
that she gave up on her dream.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.566
I have to help her dream again.

25:45.577 --> 25:47.913
I had made you sing
with pails over your heads

25:48.246 --> 25:50.081
so that you could focus
on your tone and voice

25:50.348 --> 25:53.685
and have a close encounter with music.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.989
But it was actually me

25:58.657 --> 26:01.893
who had not focused on your voices.

26:02.994 --> 26:04.296
Remove your pails.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.804
I hadn't paid attention
to what your dreams were,

26:13.104 --> 26:15.073
what concerns you had,

26:15.574 --> 26:19.144
and what your strengths
and weaknesses were.

26:20.478 --> 26:22.681
Do you see the pails you're holding?

26:24.583 --> 26:28.520
I'll start over from here.

26:29.721 --> 26:32.958
Rather than focusing on your own voices
as you did in the previous sessions,

26:33.658 --> 26:37.462
you will now focus on each other's voices.

26:38.563 --> 26:40.432
Each of you will learn
to accept your flaws

26:41.132 --> 26:44.669
and recognize one another's strengths.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.206
Why are you on our side all of a sudden?

26:49.507 --> 26:53.912
You used to compare us to the idols
and put us down.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.583
I want to prove
that you're not the ugly ducklings.

27:00.051 --> 27:00.986
To whom?

27:02.020 --> 27:03.321
To the director?

27:04.389 --> 27:05.223
No.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.192
To ourselves.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.996
You shouldn't be arrogant
just because you're professionals.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.999
The difference between an amateur
and a professional

27:15.066 --> 27:16.735
is paper-thin.

27:18.103 --> 27:20.171
What brings about
that paper-thin difference?

27:21.506 --> 27:24.409
The basic of the basics.
The most basic thing of all.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.779
What do you think that is?

27:29.581 --> 27:31.049
Desperation.

27:34.386 --> 27:37.122
To float gracefully,

27:38.289 --> 27:40.692
a swan kicks its feet
desperately underwater.

27:41.893 --> 27:42.961
I'm sure you know that.

27:45.063 --> 27:46.064
Why?

27:47.866 --> 27:49.934
Because the moment it stops kicking,

27:53.004 --> 27:54.072
it will die.

27:58.443 --> 28:00.345
You're a great singer.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.448
You really are, but...

28:05.517 --> 28:07.318
Your look isn't all that.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.588
No, do away with those thoughts!

28:10.655 --> 28:12.590
You're a good singer
and have a unique tone,

28:12.657 --> 28:14.325
plus great interpretive talent.

28:14.392 --> 28:16.161
No matter who you're with,

28:16.227 --> 28:18.463
you can support the other and harmonize.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.699
We have our lead vocalist.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.068
HONG-JU, LEAD VOCALIST,
EXCEPTIONAL VOCAL SKILL

28:25.103 --> 28:27.572
It's my dialect.
It keeps getting in the way.

28:28.306 --> 28:31.376
Your rich expressions and self-confidence

28:31.443 --> 28:33.211
are incomparable.

28:33.611 --> 28:36.915
You'll be positioned at the center
to win over the audience.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.317
You know the center position
is for the group's mascot, right?

28:39.384 --> 28:41.720
UI-BONG, CENTER OR MASCOT,
RICH IN EXPRESSIONS

28:54.899 --> 28:56.201
Just pass.

28:56.267 --> 28:58.269
YU-JIN, SUPER IDOL, OVERLY SELF-CONFIDENT

29:02.073 --> 29:05.343
Practice expressing your thoughts
through rap.

29:07.645 --> 29:10.181
-What thoughts?
-Your thoughts of rebellion.

29:11.449 --> 29:15.053
I know that you have your reasons
for being rebellious.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.089
I'm sure you have a lot
that you want to say.

29:21.025 --> 29:23.027
Express that through rap.

29:23.661 --> 29:26.297
LEE SEUL, RAPPER, JUSTICE SEEKER

29:27.866 --> 29:28.767
Ms. Ahn.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.536
Do I not have any strengths?

29:34.272 --> 29:37.742
You're not a bad dancer.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.845
Really? Am I an okay dancer?

29:41.479 --> 29:43.648
Then Sun-dong will be
the dancer of the group.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.250
SUN-DONG, DANCER, SO-SO AT KEEPING RHYTHM

29:46.484 --> 29:50.021
We have a perfect team now.

29:51.389 --> 29:52.724
That is, once Hae-seong joins us.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.863
Take control of your thoughts.

29:59.564 --> 30:00.632
Confidence.

30:01.199 --> 30:03.635
Self-assurance that no one
is better than you.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.905
You are already swans.

30:08.339 --> 30:09.507
Don't you ever forget that.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.278
Here we go.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.301
Wait.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.770
Where's JB?

30:55.787 --> 30:56.955
Where's the caramel candy?

30:57.522 --> 30:58.356
What?

30:58.923 --> 31:00.158
Why should I give that to you?

31:00.592 --> 31:02.427
Didn't my sister tell you?

31:03.528 --> 31:06.264
You have to give me a caramel candy
if you want to get along with me.

31:06.564 --> 31:07.465
Who are you?

31:09.634 --> 31:10.802
Shin Hae-seong's sister.

31:12.570 --> 31:16.241
You're here to see my sister,
aren't you, JB?

31:29.454 --> 31:33.358
I don't want to send my daughter
back to Seoul.

31:34.259 --> 31:37.762
Seeing you will make her want
to return to Seoul and do music.

31:39.464 --> 31:40.531
Are you two good friends?

31:41.232 --> 31:43.001
No, right?

31:46.037 --> 31:47.739
You can't fool me.

31:48.606 --> 31:50.508
Birds of a feather flock together.

31:51.976 --> 31:53.945
But he's way too cool for you.

31:54.946 --> 31:56.547
There's no way he would hang out with you.

32:02.620 --> 32:03.554
So...

32:04.455 --> 32:06.758
why is JB here, anyway?

32:07.725 --> 32:09.227
You said you aren't good friends with him.

32:10.795 --> 32:13.998
I don't know myself why he's here.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.602
Rather than seeing her suffering
because of a futile dream,

32:18.436 --> 32:21.239
I want to see my daughter happy.

32:21.973 --> 32:25.677
If you really care about Hae-seong,
you would understand what I'm saying.

32:27.845 --> 32:30.248
Couldn't I just have a quick word
with Hae-seong?

32:31.616 --> 32:32.717
You should leave.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.120
Sir, if I could just say hello...

32:56.808 --> 32:57.809
Are you okay?

32:59.110 --> 32:59.944
Hi.

33:01.713 --> 33:02.847
Did you get a haircut?

33:16.594 --> 33:17.795
Are you done changing?

33:19.464 --> 33:23.267
Why did you have to be so clumsy?

33:24.702 --> 33:27.772
You looked like a dummy
in front of my dad.

33:43.421 --> 33:45.423
What do you think?
Do you think I can win first place?

33:45.690 --> 33:46.524
What?

33:46.958 --> 33:47.825
First place?

33:48.326 --> 33:50.695
Tomorrow, I'm entering a beauty pageant.

33:51.696 --> 33:55.166
The Miss Little Apple Pageant.

33:56.601 --> 33:58.202
I've been preparing for it for a year.

34:01.672 --> 34:03.274
Yes. You look pretty.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.376
But...

34:05.943 --> 34:07.412
you're still pretty without the makeup.

34:10.481 --> 34:13.117
I talked to Dad already.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.887
I told him it's too late for you
to go back.

34:17.655 --> 34:21.559
So give me a ride tomorrow.
I have to sneak out.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.828
What? Give you a ride?

34:24.195 --> 34:27.899
My dad doesn't want me
to enter the pageant.

34:28.466 --> 34:29.600
It's all because of Hae-seong.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.483
That's Hae-seong's.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.553
This is Hae-seong's?

34:48.820 --> 34:49.921
Every year,

34:50.288 --> 34:52.457
our mom gave her a Rubik's Cube
for her birthday.

34:58.729 --> 35:02.333
Mom died two years ago.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.575
You'll feel better.

35:15.813 --> 35:18.149
Play with this when you're sad.

35:19.684 --> 35:20.718
It will make you feel better.

35:36.501 --> 35:37.502
How did you do it?

35:38.369 --> 35:40.037
I've never once solved it.

35:40.605 --> 35:41.439
What?

35:42.507 --> 35:45.343
Not even once?
You've had it for two years.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.247
How did you know
I've had this for two years?

35:54.352 --> 35:55.853
I used to be your fan.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.289
Hey, Hae-pung.

36:00.391 --> 36:01.225
Let's eat.

36:02.393 --> 36:03.227
Okay.

36:41.098 --> 36:42.967
-Dad.
-Yes?

36:43.367 --> 36:44.936
Stop staring.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.604
He might choke on his food.

36:46.837 --> 36:50.875
Oh, it's just that he looks so delicate,

36:51.209 --> 36:53.110
but he eats like a beast.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.713
I'm just amazed at how well he eats.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.784
It's been a while
since I've had a home-cooked meal.

37:01.018 --> 37:03.487
I'm always at the agency apartment
or the school dorm, so...

37:05.323 --> 37:10.461
Why don't you go home once in a while
and ask your parents to cook for you?

37:11.963 --> 37:14.098
My parents passed away.

37:15.833 --> 37:19.637
My mom died when I was little,
and my dad, two years ago.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.309
Well...

37:26.544 --> 37:28.746
Pain makes you grow.

37:29.647 --> 37:34.252
It's late, so you should
spend the night here.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.224
All right!

37:50.101 --> 37:52.036
There's "It's Raining" too.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.071
I'm good at that. Let me show you.

37:59.710 --> 38:00.978
See? I'm good, right?

38:02.179 --> 38:04.448
What if it's not about songs
related to the singer Rain,

38:04.915 --> 38:08.986
but songs about rain like this one?

38:09.053 --> 38:10.588
That won't be cool at all.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.196
Hasn't Hae-seong called yet?

38:21.198 --> 38:23.567
She's not answering her phone.
This is so frustrating.

38:24.001 --> 38:25.436
Do you like Hae-seong?

38:26.070 --> 38:28.506
Why are you always asking about her?

38:28.572 --> 38:29.740
I don't always ask about her.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.609
I'm just worried.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.511
See?

38:33.711 --> 38:36.647
"The lady doth protest
too much, methinks."

38:37.715 --> 38:39.784
Hong-ju denied it too.

38:43.621 --> 38:46.757
Yu-jin, forget Hae-seong.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.326
What are you talking about?

38:48.893 --> 38:49.894
Don't you know?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.697
She's dating JB.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.065
What?

38:54.832 --> 38:57.201
This is what JB said to Hae-seong's dad.

38:57.702 --> 38:58.736
Guys? Go.

38:59.870 --> 39:04.008
"Mr. Shin, I need Hae-seong."

39:09.447 --> 39:11.315
Where's Hae-seong right now?

39:12.316 --> 39:13.484
Well...

39:14.518 --> 39:16.087
in Chungju.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.488
Forget her.

39:18.389 --> 39:20.725
I heard JB is in Chungju with her.

39:55.626 --> 39:57.695
You've never once proven yourself

39:58.462 --> 39:59.864
with your talent.

40:01.665 --> 40:03.801
HershE has three years left,

40:03.868 --> 40:06.203
but you have over 50 years ahead of you.

40:08.472 --> 40:11.409
I hope you can prove
just how special you are

40:11.475 --> 40:12.877
through the upcoming audition.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.080
I'm telling you this out of concern.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.594
It's been a while since Rian practiced.

40:31.028 --> 40:33.497
After Producer Shin showed up,
she became a whole new person.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.501
What does she have
other than her pretty face?

40:38.335 --> 40:41.472
He wants talent, not just pretty faces.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.143
Last-minute practice
won't get her anywhere.

40:46.877 --> 40:48.712
She was always a nuisance to our group.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.247
Stop it.

40:50.881 --> 40:52.183
Why do you always scold me?

40:52.683 --> 40:54.318
Shouldn't we be practicing?

41:04.128 --> 41:06.931
Why did you come here?

41:08.966 --> 41:11.268
I don't know.

41:15.039 --> 41:16.307
I don't know

41:17.675 --> 41:19.076
why I came all the way here.

41:24.949 --> 41:25.783
Maybe...

41:27.051 --> 41:28.385
it was to give this back to you.

41:33.190 --> 41:35.426
It's yours, right?

41:36.794 --> 41:37.661
Yes.

41:40.397 --> 41:41.332
Thanks.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.835
I've always wanted to tell the person

41:45.703 --> 41:47.238
who gave this to me

41:49.673 --> 41:51.642
that it gave me strength

41:53.611 --> 41:54.912
when I wanted to give up.

41:58.048 --> 41:58.883
Now...

41:59.984 --> 42:01.118
it will give you strength.

42:05.623 --> 42:06.457
By the way...

42:08.959 --> 42:11.262
aren't you going to sing anymore?

42:13.998 --> 42:14.832
No.

42:16.734 --> 42:18.402
I think I've tried enough.

42:20.104 --> 42:24.241
I need to learn how to give up
if I'm not cut out for it.

42:25.509 --> 42:26.410
Who said that?

42:29.780 --> 42:31.949
Who said you weren't cut out for music?

42:35.686 --> 42:37.221
Your father said

42:38.822 --> 42:41.458
if you could move just one person
with your music,

42:42.359 --> 42:43.761
he would let you keep singing.

42:47.431 --> 42:48.399
Well, here I am.

42:49.600 --> 42:50.968
The person who was moved by your music.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.106
It's all useless now.

42:58.175 --> 43:00.210
My dad's probably waiting. Let's go.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.112
I like you.

43:03.614 --> 43:04.448
What?

43:08.052 --> 43:09.720
I like you too.

43:10.554 --> 43:13.090
I've liked you
ever since you made your debut.

43:13.157 --> 43:14.725
No. That's not what I mean.

43:17.494 --> 43:19.129
I like you not as my fan.

43:20.798 --> 43:21.632
I just...

43:22.733 --> 43:23.801
like you.

43:24.969 --> 43:26.637
Me? Why?

43:30.240 --> 43:32.309
I almost fell for it.

43:33.043 --> 43:37.214
This is no place to lie.
God will punish you.

43:47.491 --> 43:49.326
Wait. That's not water.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.997
That's wine for Communion.

44:05.476 --> 44:06.310
I...

44:07.811 --> 44:10.581
I like you.

45:09.807 --> 45:11.341
SE7EN - "WHEN I CAN'T SING"

45:16.714 --> 45:19.316
Even if I lose everything

45:20.050 --> 45:22.586
Even my popularity drops

45:23.320 --> 45:25.856
Even if I can't sing

45:26.690 --> 45:29.059
Even if I get a different job...

46:21.111 --> 46:23.280
Are you throwing those out?

46:24.948 --> 46:26.316
I don't need them anymore.

46:26.917 --> 46:27.951
Then...

46:28.719 --> 46:31.588
may I have them? Please?

46:33.357 --> 46:34.758
Sure. Go ahead.

46:34.825 --> 46:36.527
Really? I can have them?

46:36.593 --> 46:37.795
Thanks.

46:38.662 --> 46:39.563
All right.

46:42.065 --> 46:44.268
This is really cute.
Why are you throwing it out?

46:44.601 --> 46:45.469
Let me try it.

46:46.637 --> 46:47.971
What do you think? Do I look pretty?

46:51.275 --> 46:55.512
These are ratty and not paired up.
We should toss them, right?

46:58.248 --> 47:00.150
This is so cute.

48:08.752 --> 48:10.287
Hello? Hey!

48:10.354 --> 48:12.155
Do you have any idea
how many times I've called you?

48:13.423 --> 48:14.291
Who's this?

48:15.626 --> 48:16.793
And who's this?

48:17.427 --> 48:18.729
Isn't this Hae-seong's phone?

48:19.363 --> 48:20.230
Hae-seong?

48:20.530 --> 48:22.466
She's not back yet
after spending the night out.

48:22.766 --> 48:24.268
What?

48:25.102 --> 48:26.637
You must be Hae-seong's sister.

48:27.437 --> 48:28.739
She spent the night out?

48:28.805 --> 48:29.740
With whom?

48:30.140 --> 48:31.241
Where? Why?

48:31.675 --> 48:33.610
Why should I tell you?

48:33.911 --> 48:34.745
Hey!

48:35.279 --> 48:37.347
She is with JB right now, isn't she?

48:38.515 --> 48:41.218
You should have nicer manners.

48:42.753 --> 48:45.022
You don't even identify yourself

48:45.389 --> 48:47.224
and here you are demanding information.

48:47.291 --> 48:48.125
I'm hanging up.

48:49.192 --> 48:50.694
Hey!

48:50.928 --> 48:53.530
What's Hae-seong doing now?
Did you really hang up?

49:01.838 --> 49:02.839
Home.

49:04.741 --> 49:05.842
What were you up to?

49:06.543 --> 49:09.713
I can't go to class. I'm sick.

49:14.217 --> 49:15.886
Nice try.

49:16.420 --> 49:17.788
He's off to see Hae-seong.

49:18.855 --> 49:19.690
But...

49:20.691 --> 49:22.392
does he have a chance against JB?

49:25.896 --> 49:28.298
Ms. Ahn, you know
Hae-seong's home address, right?

49:28.765 --> 49:29.967
I'll go and talk to her.

49:31.034 --> 49:33.303
I was going to go myself.

49:33.370 --> 49:35.772
I'll go and persuade her
to come back to Kirin.

49:36.273 --> 49:38.141
No. I have to go.

49:57.861 --> 49:59.830
Another audition?

49:59.896 --> 50:02.566
She went through three or four auditions
to enter the agency.

50:02.632 --> 50:04.501
Weekend evaluations,
month-end evaluations...

50:04.568 --> 50:06.737
You put her through so much
until she made her debut.

50:07.004 --> 50:10.307
You kept her off TV and stuck her here,
and now there's another audition?

50:11.541 --> 50:12.576
Ma'am.

50:13.443 --> 50:17.014
-We have a plan--
-What plan?

50:17.214 --> 50:20.917
You haven't made any plans
for her comeback.

50:21.918 --> 50:25.088
If you keep her in limbo,
we're finding a new agency.

50:25.756 --> 50:26.823
Release her from her contract.

50:33.463 --> 50:35.932
-If you wait a bit longer--
-"A bit longer"?

50:35.999 --> 50:37.367
How much longer?

50:37.701 --> 50:40.470
My family will starve
if we have to wait longer.

50:40.537 --> 50:42.839
She's the only one supporting us.

50:43.740 --> 50:44.975
Mom.

50:51.014 --> 50:55.052
Take responsibility and get shows for her.

50:55.952 --> 50:59.222
At her age, every passing month
and year means money lost.

51:01.758 --> 51:02.826
All right.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.829
We'll see if we can set Rian up
with some individual appearances.

51:12.402 --> 51:15.572
And I won't come all the way here again.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.975
Next time, we're just switching agencies.

51:31.755 --> 51:32.756
You're excused.

51:40.997 --> 51:43.166
How did I do? Not bad, right?

51:43.533 --> 51:46.203
Mom, I told you not to be like this.

51:46.269 --> 51:48.905
I couldn't just sit back.

51:50.574 --> 51:53.910
-This is all for your own good.
-You hate being confrontational.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.082
I practiced over 100 times
in front of the mirror.

52:00.484 --> 52:02.319
I'm as good an actress as you are, right?

52:05.355 --> 52:08.125
I'm going now. Don't skip meals.

52:10.093 --> 52:13.163
You're skinnier
than when you were busy with work.

52:14.664 --> 52:16.466
Don't worry too much either.

52:18.835 --> 52:20.003
I'm off now.

52:47.898 --> 52:48.899
Yes, sir.

52:49.533 --> 52:51.768
About the event you mentioned
a while back,

52:52.169 --> 52:54.037
I think I can help you.

52:54.638 --> 52:55.472
Yes.

52:56.573 --> 52:59.476
One of my singers will be free that day.

52:59.709 --> 53:00.544
Yes.

53:01.711 --> 53:03.280
Oh, don't mention it.

53:05.081 --> 53:06.883
All right. Bye.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.321
SEOUL TO CHUNGJU

53:11.388 --> 53:14.758
Mr. Lee got this gig just for you.

53:14.824 --> 53:18.361
If you do well this time,
he'll get you more individual gigs,

53:18.428 --> 53:20.530
so do your best.

53:28.004 --> 53:31.341
Why can't he let me use
one of the company vans?

53:56.700 --> 53:59.236
What's up with you?
Why are you stalking me?

54:00.370 --> 54:03.006
I'm going to Chungju on personal business.

54:07.811 --> 54:08.878
What happened earlier...

54:10.280 --> 54:11.114
Are you okay?

54:13.583 --> 54:14.417
Earlier?

54:15.085 --> 54:15.919
What do you mean?

54:16.353 --> 54:17.187
Nothing.

54:19.022 --> 54:19.856
Never mind.

55:18.682 --> 55:20.650
Did something happen
between you two last night?

55:20.984 --> 55:21.818
No!

55:21.885 --> 55:22.986
No.

55:23.053 --> 55:24.020
What are you talking about?

55:24.921 --> 55:25.989
Nothing happened.

55:26.956 --> 55:29.426
What are you talking about?
Nothing happened.

55:33.897 --> 55:35.398
Something's fishy.

55:49.813 --> 55:51.147
Hello, ma'am.

55:51.581 --> 55:53.683
Do you know a girl named Shin Hae-seong?

55:54.684 --> 55:57.754
-You came to see Hae-seong?
-Yes.

55:58.221 --> 56:04.427
She went downtown
for the Miss Apple Pageant.

56:04.961 --> 56:07.597
-Miss Apple Pageant?
-Yes.

56:08.765 --> 56:13.503
Why is it that the young guys
who come to see Hae-seong

56:13.570 --> 56:15.505
are all so handsome?

56:16.406 --> 56:17.340
Thank you.

56:18.241 --> 56:21.478
How do I get downtown?

56:21.544 --> 56:22.746
Well,

56:23.213 --> 56:27.150
go down this way
and then follow the road up that way.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.486
I see. I got it.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.020
Thank you.

56:32.622 --> 56:33.857
-Take care.
-Bye.

56:35.225 --> 56:36.493
Miss Apple?

56:36.926 --> 56:37.761
Gosh.

56:38.495 --> 56:40.597
Shin Hae-seong will do
just about anything.

56:45.402 --> 56:46.269
What?

56:47.103 --> 56:48.671
Am I really supposed to sing here?

56:56.913 --> 56:59.649
-Are you in charge here?
-Over there.

57:01.484 --> 57:04.721
Excuse me. Who's the person in charge?

57:05.221 --> 57:06.856
Who's in charge here?

57:10.960 --> 57:12.429
Are you...

57:14.097 --> 57:15.965
Hello. I'm Rian of HershE.

57:16.266 --> 57:17.434
I'm here to sing.

57:18.401 --> 57:19.335
Come with me.

57:29.312 --> 57:30.346
Put this on.

57:32.115 --> 57:32.949
What is this?

57:44.294 --> 57:45.295
MR. LEE

57:48.298 --> 57:50.733
Wear it and send me a photo.

57:56.806 --> 57:57.640
What?

57:58.741 --> 58:00.643
Put this on and take a photo of myself?

58:10.587 --> 58:11.454
Mom.

58:12.088 --> 58:13.723
I really can't do this.

58:14.524 --> 58:16.192
You have no idea
what kind of situation I'm in.

58:19.796 --> 58:20.630
What?

58:22.599 --> 58:23.633
Ten million won?

58:25.635 --> 58:27.470
Mr. Lee wired you ten million won?

58:31.274 --> 58:33.309
Fine. I'll do it.

58:46.489 --> 58:48.725
MISS LITTLE APPLE PAGEANT

58:50.860 --> 58:51.694
What's this?

58:53.363 --> 58:54.297
Are we at the right place?

58:55.465 --> 58:57.667
They're probably still setting up.

58:58.468 --> 59:00.036
This really is it.

59:04.007 --> 59:04.841
You're good!

59:06.075 --> 59:10.346
This is where the new chapter
of my life begins.

59:16.252 --> 59:17.186
Here.

59:17.654 --> 59:22.458
We will soon commence
the Miss Little Apple Pageant,

59:22.892 --> 59:26.663
so please take your seats.

59:27.297 --> 59:29.832
It's dusty if people move around,
so please stay quiet and seated.

59:30.266 --> 59:31.868
If you've been drinking,
sit way in the back.

59:31.935 --> 59:33.469
We don't want to smell
your alcohol breath.

59:33.536 --> 59:35.572
It's one person to a chair.

59:35.638 --> 59:37.907
-You really got ready for this.
-Please give a round of applause.

59:39.909 --> 59:42.612
-I know everyone wants to stand out,
-We will start the event shortly.

59:43.012 --> 59:46.549
but isn't it too much to enter a pageant
wearing a kitty mask?

59:49.285 --> 59:51.220
Mind your own business.

59:52.088 --> 59:53.022
Sit down.

59:56.292 --> 59:57.760
Look up front.

1:00:01.197 --> 1:00:05.535
And now, a special guest singer
will help us launch the pageant.

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:07.470
Come on out.

1:00:09.706 --> 1:00:11.708
Isn't this a HershE song?

1:00:13.710 --> 1:00:16.613
HershE would never perform
at an event like this though.

1:00:24.053 --> 1:00:25.121
I'm coming.

1:00:48.711 --> 1:00:51.681
She looks a lot like Rian.

1:00:52.949 --> 1:00:54.951
When did they find
such a great look-alike?

1:01:03.559 --> 1:01:05.361
So this must be where she's performing.

1:01:10.833 --> 1:01:12.235
Hey, what are you doing?

1:01:13.102 --> 1:01:16.939
If you got paid to be here,
shouldn't you be singing?

1:01:17.306 --> 1:01:19.409
Where did they get such an amateur?

1:01:19.475 --> 1:01:21.711
What do they take our town for?

1:01:21.778 --> 1:01:22.712
-Come on!
-Whoever she is,

1:01:22.779 --> 1:01:24.180
she must be really embarrassed.

1:01:26.082 --> 1:01:29.352
Get off the stage.
Get off if you can't sing.

1:01:30.353 --> 1:01:31.587
-That's right.
-I'll do the singing.

1:01:31.654 --> 1:01:32.522
Very nice.

1:01:33.489 --> 1:01:35.625
No, that's not it.

1:01:50.740 --> 1:01:51.941
Let's just go.

1:01:52.008 --> 1:01:53.509
-What is wrong with her?
-Let's go.

1:01:53.576 --> 1:01:56.012
Just sing a song!

1:02:19.035 --> 1:02:20.903
Isn't that...

1:02:21.938 --> 1:02:23.039
Rian?

1:02:28.144 --> 1:02:29.078
Are you okay?

1:02:29.412 --> 1:02:30.546
Is she all right?

1:02:36.586 --> 1:02:37.720
Hey. Wake up.
