WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:07.708 --> 01:09.583
Tigger: Bounce, 1, 2, 3.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.583
Bounce, 4, 5, 6.

01:11.583 --> 01:13.583
I can bounce over this.

01:13.583 --> 01:16.750
I can bounce over that with
one leg tied behind my back.

01:16.750 --> 01:19.750
I could do it blindfolded
with my ears in my mouth.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.875
Oh, perhaps I should
bounce on my head,

01:24.875 --> 01:26.875
where it's softer.

01:26.875 --> 01:29.083
Aw, that's okay,
Pooh boy,

01:29.083 --> 01:31.583
You don't
become a skilled
bouncer overnight.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.500
Takes
at least 12 hours.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.708
Watch this.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.291
I'm gonna double-triple bounce

01:38.291 --> 01:41.125
over the highest tree
in the woods.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.708
Oh, boy. Hoo hoo!

01:42.708 --> 01:44.083
I've been waiting
for this.

01:44.083 --> 01:45.833
You need just the right light

01:45.833 --> 01:48.416
to bounce a tree topper
like that one.

01:48.416 --> 01:50.166
You got a good view, Pooh?

01:50.166 --> 01:53.333
Yes, Tigger.
A very bright one.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.458
1 for Tigger, 2 for the tree,

01:56.458 --> 01:58.125
3 to do something, and--

01:59.291 --> 02:01.625
Hey! Who swiped the sun?

02:01.625 --> 02:04.083
Could you bounce again?

02:04.083 --> 02:06.083
I must have missed it
the first time.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.458
You didn't miss
anything, Pooh boy.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.583
I didn't bounce
on account of because

02:10.583 --> 02:14.000
that puny little cloud
casting a gigantical shadow.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.625
Shoo! Go away!
I'm bouncing here!

02:16.625 --> 02:19.000
Get along, little cloudie.

02:22.083 --> 02:24.750
Am-scray, oud-clay! Blow away!

02:24.750 --> 02:28.000
And don't show your fluffy
face around here again!

02:28.000 --> 02:31.125
Hoo! Guess I showed that
cloud a thing or three.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.375
Hoo hoo!

02:32.375 --> 02:34.708
I could have taken him.

02:34.708 --> 02:36.833
Maybe it's best
you didn't.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.000
Let's go, Tigger.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.458
Perhaps today's not
a good day for bouncing.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.833
I think it's a good day
for running.

02:43.833 --> 02:45.583
Nonsense, Pooh.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.875
This day was made
for bouncing.

02:48.958 --> 02:51.166
Hey! Who turned out the sky?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.500
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

02:56.500 --> 02:58.833
The sky's not big enough
for both of us.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.125
See?

03:01.125 --> 03:03.000
It's a scaredy cloud. Hoo!

03:06.000 --> 03:08.166
Don't cry, little cloud.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.625
Tigger didn't mean it.

03:12.250 --> 03:13.875
Hey, knock it off!

03:13.875 --> 03:16.250
Don't you have a parade
you can go rain on?

03:18.708 --> 03:20.833
Why am I the only one

03:20.833 --> 03:22.875
getting drenched
by this cloud?

03:22.875 --> 03:26.375
Maybe it doesn't
like wet bears.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.708
Well, I don't like wet clouds.

03:37.375 --> 03:41.166
Oh, my. Oh, my. And not
a cloud in the sky,

03:41.166 --> 03:43.500
except the one
over Tigger's head.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.166
Yeah.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.416
This cloud's gotten
really attached to me.

03:47.416 --> 03:49.875
Could you maybe please
do something, bunny boy?

03:49.875 --> 03:51.583
Please?

03:51.583 --> 03:54.583
Of course, Tigger.
What are friends for?

03:54.583 --> 03:57.958
Just seems to be
raining on you.

03:57.958 --> 04:00.875
Yeah. All day, too.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.583
I think it wants to be
a storm when it grows up.

04:03.583 --> 04:07.291
Maybe I should just pose
in the middle of your garden

04:07.291 --> 04:09.250
and be a fountain
or something.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.875
Why, that's it!

04:10.875 --> 04:13.250
Tigger, stand over
my tomatoes.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.708
They're a little dry.

04:14.708 --> 04:17.000
I feel like a walking
watering can.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.166
And these seedlings
need watering.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.875
And when you're done,

04:20.875 --> 04:23.000
perhaps you can take a stroll
along my cabbage patch.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.750
Glad this cloud's
making somebody happy.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.708
Too bad it has to be Rabbit.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.500
Well done, Tigger.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.250
Come tomorrow. We'll
start on the back 40.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.458
Rain, rain, go away.

04:34.458 --> 04:37.458
And come again
on some other guy.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.750
What a very big apple.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.291
And since this isn't
an apple tree,

04:44.291 --> 04:48.000
I bet it's a cleverly
disguised beehive.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.250
Oh, bees, that's a very
nice apple you have,

04:52.250 --> 04:56.000
and it's probably
just filled with honey.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.500
How thoughtful. It's trying
to fall off the tree for me.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.875
Shh! Pooh, it's me: Tigger.

05:03.875 --> 05:05.750
I'm hiding from that cloud.

05:05.750 --> 05:10.166
Uh, so I guess I'm not going
to get any honey out of you.

05:10.166 --> 05:12.416
Sorry, Pooh.
Better keep moving.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.958
Cloudy will get suspicious

05:13.958 --> 05:15.750
if it sees you
talking to an apple.

05:17.750 --> 05:21.375
If a certain cloud
is listening,

05:21.375 --> 05:23.833
I was just chatting
with myself

05:23.833 --> 05:26.333
and not an apple or a tigger.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.750
Feels sort of like snow.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.875
Tastes sort of
like snow, too.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.208
Snow!

05:41.583 --> 05:44.375
I wonder-- oof--
if he-- oof--

05:44.375 --> 05:47.833
suspects-- oof--
that it's-- oof-- me.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.333
One cloud-proofed house.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.000
Ah.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.250
Home, dry home.

06:26.625 --> 06:29.458
Man the life boats!
We're going down!

06:31.000 --> 06:34.583
When's this cloud cover
going to lift?

06:44.708 --> 06:47.875
Oh, look. It's Tigger
with his cloud friend.

06:51.083 --> 06:54.208
Hello, Tigger.
Nice day, isn't it?

06:54.208 --> 06:56.291
Yeah. If you're a duckie.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.500
I got to get my head
out of this cloud.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.625
I've come up with a plan,
but I need your help.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.458
I'm not so sure-- oof--

07:09.458 --> 07:10.958
about this, Pooh.

07:10.958 --> 07:14.875
Oh, it isn't so bad, Piglet,

07:14.875 --> 07:17.458
except for the bouncing part.

07:17.458 --> 07:21.583
Uh, maybe tiggers just have
more spring in their springs.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.583
Oh, d-d-dear.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.583
It's an awfully fast cloud
coming awfully fast.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.000
Ahem.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.458
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

07:38.625 --> 07:40.625
Gotcha, you big dripper!

07:40.625 --> 07:42.375
Tigger, now
that you've got it,

07:42.375 --> 07:43.583
where do you plan
to take it?

07:43.583 --> 07:45.875
Anywhere I'm not.

07:51.458 --> 07:52.625
All: Yikes!

07:58.708 --> 08:01.125
He'll never find us here.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.000
Lucky guess.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.958
What will we do now?

08:06.958 --> 08:09.375
Roast marshmallows?

08:10.375 --> 08:11.958
Head for the logs!

08:18.583 --> 08:21.500
Uh, I think
having three tiggers

08:21.500 --> 08:24.208
made the cloud
three times as upset.

08:26.875 --> 08:30.166
Right now, being a tigger
is three times as upsetting.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.708
This cloud has
water on the brain.

08:32.708 --> 08:36.125
It does seem to have
a mind of its own.

08:36.125 --> 08:39.333
Uh, Tigger, have you ever
tried talking to it?

08:39.333 --> 08:42.458
Buddy bear,
it's a cloud.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.416
But just in case--
hoo hoo--

08:47.416 --> 08:49.708
what would you say
to a cloud, Pooh boy?

08:49.708 --> 08:51.875
Well...

08:51.875 --> 08:54.000
I might apologize.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.500
Apologize?
He started it

08:57.500 --> 08:59.875
by blocking the sun
for no good reason.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.416
But the cloud was just doing

09:08.416 --> 09:09.708
what clouds do.

09:09.708 --> 09:11.833
They seem to do
a lot of thundering

09:11.833 --> 09:13.166
and lightning, too.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.583
Maybe when you
said those things

09:15.583 --> 09:17.583
and threw that stone,

09:17.583 --> 09:19.458
you hurt the cloud's
feelings.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.250
You mean all this rain

09:21.250 --> 09:23.375
could be over a little
thing like that?

09:23.375 --> 09:26.708
You never know what's
going to upset a cloud.

09:26.708 --> 09:28.416
Oh, they are very sensitive.

09:28.416 --> 09:30.583
You might have a point.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.708
Out of the mouth
of bears.

09:34.708 --> 09:38.583
Hmm. Maybe it ran
out of water.

09:38.583 --> 09:42.250
Um, excuse me,
little white fluffy cloud,

09:42.250 --> 09:45.125
um, uh, could you,
um, maybe, uh,

09:45.125 --> 09:46.875
stop raining?

09:49.291 --> 09:52.291
Sorry. Didn't mean to shout.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.375
It's just I have a couple
of things to say

09:54.375 --> 09:55.750
about earlier today.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.583
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings,

09:57.583 --> 09:59.625
but I was trying to jump
over this tree, see?

09:59.625 --> 10:01.583
And you got in the way,
hey, and, well,

10:01.583 --> 10:04.583
I'm sorry
for calling you names

10:04.583 --> 10:06.250
and throwing rocks.

10:06.250 --> 10:10.416
And I promise never to insult
any cloud ever again.

10:10.416 --> 10:11.958
Cross my stripes.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.583
Does this mean
you forgive me?

10:19.583 --> 10:21.291
Ah.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.166
Ooh. Hoo hoo.
It's softer than fluff.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.000
I could get used to this.

10:36.458 --> 10:40.083
Oh, you got a great
view from here.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.250
Hey, my bouncing tree.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.083
Thanks, cloud pal.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.208
Told you I could
bounce that tree.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.625
Hoo hoo hoo!

10:57.625 --> 10:58.708
Weather permitting.

11:05.500 --> 11:09.125
I'll look you up
the next time it's storming!

11:09.125 --> 11:12.583
All in all, not a bad guy
for a cloud.

11:12.583 --> 11:15.125
I guess he's got
other things to do,

11:15.125 --> 11:16.958
other people to rain on.

11:16.958 --> 11:20.458
And you've got other
trees to bounce.

11:20.458 --> 11:21.875
Right, buddy bear.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.208
And from the cloud

11:23.208 --> 11:26.083
I saw this really,
really tall one.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.416
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
There. Now how about
a nice drink of water?

11:45.708 --> 11:48.166
What? Still thirsty?

11:48.166 --> 11:50.875
Huh, By all means
have some more.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.166
Nothing's too good

11:52.166 --> 11:54.583
for my precious
rutabaga-potato.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.875
Is the sun too bright for you?

11:56.875 --> 11:58.208
Perhaps it's too stuffy?

11:58.208 --> 12:00.208
Would you like
something to read?

12:00.208 --> 12:01.583
Is that better?

12:01.583 --> 12:04.333
Ah. You are, without a doubt,

12:04.333 --> 12:07.333
the most wonderful plant
I've ever grown.

12:08.875 --> 12:11.000
But don't tell the carrots
I said that.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
- What-- Oh, my.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.375
My garden! Stop, I say!

12:16.375 --> 12:18.708
Cease! Go back! Wrong way!

12:18.708 --> 12:20.208
My putabaga-rotato!

12:20.208 --> 12:22.250
My ruta-potaga-batato!

12:22.250 --> 12:24.416
My-- My-- My goodness!

12:24.416 --> 12:25.708
- No!
-

12:26.708 --> 12:28.125
Say!

12:28.125 --> 12:31.416
That's one doozy
of a roadblock.

12:31.416 --> 12:33.458
Gopher,
you very nearly destroyed

12:33.458 --> 12:35.083
my rutabaga-potato.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.083
Never mind that thingie.

12:37.083 --> 12:40.708
I got some spectacular
news, sonny.

12:40.708 --> 12:43.458
It's a letter
from my grandpappy

12:43.458 --> 12:46.333
saying he's coming
for a visit.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.583
You have no idea how delicate,

12:48.583 --> 12:51.500
how terribly fragile
this plant it.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.000
The poor thing is
probably a nervous wreck.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.708
By dinghy,

12:55.708 --> 12:57.750
my grandpappy Gopher

12:57.750 --> 13:00.583
is the gopher
to end all gophers.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.958
Why, it only blooms once
every five and a half years,

13:03.958 --> 13:07.125
and then only if the second
Tuesday falls on the 15th.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.833
He's got the greatest
architectural

13:09.833 --> 13:12.958
and structural mind
of all time.

13:12.958 --> 13:17.208
If anything would happen to
my beloved rutabaga-potato--

13:17.208 --> 13:20.875
Gopher, did you say
you had a grandfather?

13:20.875 --> 13:22.583
Uh, sure did.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.125
And he's coming to visit?

13:25.125 --> 13:29.250
Yep. he's gonna build
the first underground city

13:29.250 --> 13:31.083
ever built above ground.

13:31.083 --> 13:34.333
And he's going to
build it right here.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.291
Mm, he'll be a shoo-in

13:36.291 --> 13:39.458
to win the Pewter Pickax
Award this--

13:39.458 --> 13:43.583
year!

13:44.708 --> 13:47.333
Hmm. Got to get
that step fixed

13:47.333 --> 13:49.833
before Grandpappy gets here.

13:49.833 --> 13:52.458
Oh, my. Gopher
has a grandfather.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.458
Why, one gopher is bad enough.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.875
Two would be nothing
short of disaster.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.458
I have to warn
the others immediately.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.166
We must do something

14:02.166 --> 14:03.750
to stop Gopher's grandfather

14:03.750 --> 14:06.208
from destroying
our very way of life,

14:06.208 --> 14:08.250
not to mention
my rutabaga-potato.

14:08.250 --> 14:09.875
Any questions?

14:09.875 --> 14:12.083
Oh, perhaps we
should have a party

14:12.083 --> 14:14.000
to welcome Grandfather Gopher.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.875
Oh, that's a very nice
idea, Pooh Bear.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.833
It's twice as nice
as nice.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.000
It's incredibibble.
It's unbelievabibble.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.083
Why, it's downright
unnecessary.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.416
Don't you understand?

14:25.416 --> 14:27.375
If a son takes
after his father

14:27.375 --> 14:28.875
and fathers
after their fathers,

14:28.875 --> 14:30.416
it goes without saying

14:30.416 --> 14:31.625
that Gopher must
take after his father

14:31.625 --> 14:33.208
who takes after his father!

14:33.208 --> 14:36.250
We must keep Gopher's
grandfather so busy

14:36.250 --> 14:38.708
he won't have time
to destroy anything.

14:38.708 --> 14:41.000
Pooh Bear, you shall
be in charge

14:41.000 --> 14:43.125
of keeping him busy
doing nothing.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.500
Yeah, Pooh boy.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.583
Nobody does nothing
like you do nothing,

14:46.583 --> 14:48.000
and that's saying something.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.708
Why, thank you.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.833
It's nice to know
I'm good at something,

14:51.833 --> 14:53.458
even if it is nothing.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.708
Gopher: Yep, yep, yep.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.125
Won't be long now.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.708
His letter said he'd be here

14:58.708 --> 15:00.875
at half past some time
in the afternoon,

15:00.875 --> 15:02.875
uh, precisely.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.250
One for you. One for you.

15:10.708 --> 15:13.416
Three more seconds!

15:13.416 --> 15:15.750
2, 1!

15:15.750 --> 15:20.291
Let's hear it for the most
stupendous master builder

15:20.291 --> 15:21.833
of all time!

15:21.833 --> 15:24.125
All: Hip hip hooray!

15:26.375 --> 15:28.458
Uh, just a moment,
if you please.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.416
We're waiting for Gopher's
grandfather to arrive.

15:31.416 --> 15:36.416
Oh. You would not happen
to be that gopher,

15:36.416 --> 15:37.416
would you?

15:37.416 --> 15:39.416
Yep.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.708
Well, then we're
waiting for you.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.458
It's very exciting,
isn't it?

15:43.458 --> 15:45.833
You should be here
any moment now.

15:45.833 --> 15:49.250
What in tarnation
could be keeping--

15:49.250 --> 15:50.625
Grandpappy!

15:50.625 --> 15:52.833
Is it really you?

15:52.833 --> 15:54.291
Yep.

15:54.291 --> 15:57.166
Uh, did you have trouble
finding the place?

15:57.166 --> 15:59.125
Nope.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.958
Yes, sir!
That's my grandpappy!

16:01.958 --> 16:04.291
He's a gopher of few words.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.500
Sounds like a gopher
of two words.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.458
Well, let's roll out
those blueprints

16:09.458 --> 16:12.125
and start building
right away.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.583
Grandpappy,
this is your year

16:14.583 --> 16:17.000
to win
the Pewter Pickax Award.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.375
Building? Right away?

16:19.375 --> 16:20.458
Oh, no!

16:20.458 --> 16:21.875
Gopher,

16:21.875 --> 16:23.750
Grandpappy
must be very tired

16:23.750 --> 16:25.125
from his long journey.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.458
I'm sure he needs to--

16:27.708 --> 16:29.333
relax.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.000
Yep.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
But, uh, Grandpappy,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.708
what about the, uh,
Pewter Pickax?

16:39.875 --> 16:43.291
Can you think of any
better way to spend a day

16:43.291 --> 16:44.583
than doing nothing?

16:44.583 --> 16:47.958
And doing it so very
well.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.750
Nope.

16:49.750 --> 16:53.208
Well, that's enough
rest and relaxation,

16:53.208 --> 16:54.291
eh, Grandpappy?

16:54.291 --> 16:56.875
Time to start building.
Right?

16:58.458 --> 16:59.750
Tigger: Hey, Grandpapa!

16:59.750 --> 17:02.333
Want to go picanicking
with me? Mm?

17:02.333 --> 17:06.166
Mm! He doesn't want to go
on some silly picnic,

17:06.166 --> 17:07.583
do you, Grandpappy?

17:10.208 --> 17:11.250
Yep.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.166
TTFN. Ta-ta for now.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.000
Say,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.166
whose grandpappy
is he anyways?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.708
If I ate another bite,

17:24.708 --> 17:26.250
I'd bust a stripe.

17:26.250 --> 17:30.000
Would you care for another
small smackerel,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.250
Grandpappy Gopher?

17:31.250 --> 17:32.625
Nope.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.291
Yipes!

17:36.291 --> 17:39.833
Ready to construct
something, Grandpappy?

17:39.833 --> 17:43.500
Gopher, where are
your mannerisms?

17:43.500 --> 17:46.208
We haven't had dessert yet.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

17:51.500 --> 17:53.708
How's that? Comfortable?

17:53.708 --> 17:55.375
Yep.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.000
Anything to keep my
rutabaga-potato safe--

17:58.000 --> 18:01.875
eh, uh, I mean, uh,
anything to make you happy.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.583
That's enough!

18:04.583 --> 18:06.875
I'm sick and tired of you guys

18:06.875 --> 18:09.875
hogging my grandpappy.

18:09.875 --> 18:13.208
Tomorrow me and him are
gonna start building.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.583
Nope.

18:15.583 --> 18:17.708
Did you say nope?

18:17.708 --> 18:18.833
Yep.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.458
But, Grandpappy!

18:23.458 --> 18:24.583
- Shh!
- Shh!

18:26.583 --> 18:29.250
I can't believe it.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.166
My own grandpappy,

18:31.166 --> 18:34.416
a-- a sit-around do-nothing.

18:34.416 --> 18:39.333
Well, I'm not gonna
let Grandpappy's dreams of
winning the Pewter Pickax

18:39.333 --> 18:41.458
go up in smoke.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.625
I'm gonna take action.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.416
What is going on?

18:49.416 --> 18:52.083
My rutabaga-potato!

18:52.083 --> 18:55.583
This must be the work
of Grandfather Gopher.

18:55.583 --> 18:59.416
I must stop him before
everything is destroyed!

18:59.416 --> 19:01.000
Grandfather Gopher!

19:01.000 --> 19:02.875
Grandpappy,
where are you?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.416
Come out, come out,
wherever you aren't.

19:05.416 --> 19:07.125
Where could he be?

19:07.125 --> 19:09.375
He could be up here,
Rabbit.

19:09.375 --> 19:10.958
And in fact, he is.

19:10.958 --> 19:13.125
We've been gathering
honey, you see.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.333
But if he's up there,

19:15.333 --> 19:18.708
then who's responsible
for all this confounded
construction?

19:19.875 --> 19:21.708
Out of my way!

19:21.708 --> 19:25.750
A gopher's got to do
what a gopher's got to do.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.208
And I'm doing it.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.708
And, uh, Gopher,

19:28.708 --> 19:30.708
just what is it
you're doing?

19:30.708 --> 19:32.958
Carrying out
Grandpappy's plans

19:32.958 --> 19:35.625
for the first above-ground
underground city,

19:35.625 --> 19:36.875
that's what.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.583
I'm not gonna sit around

19:38.583 --> 19:40.083
and watch you lose out

19:40.083 --> 19:42.250
on the Pewter Pickax,
Grandpappy.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.625
Oh, no! My rutabaga-potato!

19:50.625 --> 19:52.333
I'll save you.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.708
By dinghy, it's done.

20:03.416 --> 20:07.083
Pooh: It certainly is
large-ish, isn't it?

20:07.083 --> 20:12.708
The first underground city
ever built above the ground!

20:12.708 --> 20:15.250
Let's contact
the judging committee.

20:15.250 --> 20:19.208
That Pewter Pickax
is in the bag! Huh?

20:21.583 --> 20:24.125
I must have misread the plans

20:24.125 --> 20:26.708
and missed
a specification or two.

20:27.708 --> 20:28.875
Run for the hills!

20:28.875 --> 20:31.500
She's coming down!

20:37.000 --> 20:39.583
I'm sorry, Grandpappy.

20:39.583 --> 20:43.250
I don't think you're going
to win the Pewter Pickax now.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.708
Nope.

20:44.708 --> 20:47.875
Guess you're
pretty disappointed

20:47.875 --> 20:49.416
in your grandsonny.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.083
Nope.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.583
- You're not?
- Nope.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.458
I don't understand.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.166
I knew it would never work.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.583
The fun part
was dreaming it up.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.000
If I'd have built it,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.416
I wouldn't have anything
left to dream about.

21:04.416 --> 21:06.125
You mean to say

21:06.125 --> 21:11.500
my own dear grandpappy
is nothing but a dreamer?

21:11.500 --> 21:12.708
Yep.

21:12.708 --> 21:15.583
Well, I guess
some of us are doers

21:15.583 --> 21:18.416
and some are just dreamers.

21:20.625 --> 21:22.125
Perhaps, Gopher,

21:22.125 --> 21:23.750
if you put your
grandfather's dreaming

21:23.750 --> 21:25.416
together
with your doing--

21:25.416 --> 21:27.333
Why, there'd be
no stopping you.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.958
- But-- But- But-- But--
- By ding-dangy, you're right!

21:30.958 --> 21:32.625
What say we build

21:32.625 --> 21:34.750
that on-the-ground
underground city

21:34.750 --> 21:36.083
you've been dreaming about?

21:38.708 --> 21:40.583
We can put it
right here.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.375
Afraid this plant's
got to go, Rabbit.

21:45.875 --> 21:50.416
Oh, my. Is it Tuesday
the 15th already?

21:50.416 --> 21:52.416
How time flies.

21:52.416 --> 21:55.291
Five and a half years
went by, just like that.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.333
Well, seems to me

21:57.333 --> 21:59.750
every city needs
some flowers in it.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.458
We'll leave it be.

22:01.458 --> 22:02.833
Oh, my.

22:02.833 --> 22:06.000
But the rest will have to go.
