El Gato!

00:23.483 --> 00:24.483
<b>4x05 - Written By</b>

00:45.921 --> 00:48.173
Ha-ha!
You will take that!

00:50.509 --> 00:51.510
And that!

00:52.094 --> 00:53.679
And you will take this!

01:01.895 --> 01:02.813
Ha-ha!

01:06.733 --> 01:08.402
Thief in the corner barrel.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.286
Now you are just showing off!

01:17.869 --> 01:19.371
You have not learned your lesson.

01:19.871 --> 01:23.375
I'm sorry. Was there a
lesson with the butt-kicking?

01:23.458 --> 01:24.459
En garde.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.878
Yah-ha!

01:46.481 --> 01:48.233
What were we supposed
to learn from this?

01:48.817 --> 01:51.570
The usual. No thieving,
be nice to orphans, no littering.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.364
The things you were supposed
to have learned in Dulcinea's school.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.909
Come, Babieca.
Let us leave these degenerates.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.536
Back to San Lorenzo!

01:59.620 --> 02:01.330
Hyah!

02:03.749 --> 02:07.377
We should not have to take
this kind of abuse from Puss in Boots!

02:08.044 --> 02:10.255
Yeah. We have to put a stop to this.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.133
Say, let's put a bounty on Puss's head.

02:13.216 --> 02:16.219
A thousand reales
to whomever takes him out!

02:17.846 --> 02:20.515
And not to a fancy dinner!

02:23.185 --> 02:25.103
Not to a fancy dinner, right?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.148
- Definitely not.
- Why would you think that?

02:35.197 --> 02:39.910
Ugh! This crown infuriates me
mit its insouciance!

02:40.744 --> 02:42.162
Oh, think, Uli.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.665
Did you ever hear anything
about the Crown of Souls

02:44.748 --> 02:46.124
during your time in the...

02:46.583 --> 02:47.876
What was it called?

02:47.959 --> 02:50.629
Ancient and Horrible
Order of the Bloodwolf?

02:51.421 --> 02:53.924
I was never in this thing. Oh!

02:54.007 --> 02:58.261
You mean the Ancient und Terrible Order
of das Blutwolf!

02:58.345 --> 03:01.223
What a comical error
you have made.

03:03.683 --> 03:04.851
But nein.

03:04.935 --> 03:08.397
All I know is that it may be able
to defeat das Blutwolf

03:08.480 --> 03:12.275
when used by The One
from the Great Prophecy!

03:13.735 --> 03:15.028
Und here he is.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.696
Good day, amigos.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.950
I have had much success dispensing lessons
at the Thieves' Market.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.495
So, have you figured out
what the crown does?

03:23.578 --> 03:25.163
Oh, we sure have.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.582
Wonderful. Tell me at once.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.918
Oh. You meant literally.

03:30.001 --> 03:33.213
No, no, we've been entirely unsuccessful.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.965
Zero successes.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.427
Even with the gem in place,
it doesn't seem to do anything.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.888
Get a job, freeloader!

03:44.182 --> 03:47.227
I'm usually really good
at figuring out how things work.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.270
Hang on.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.772
I know who would know
how the Crown of Souls works.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.733
Miguel A. Andante.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.865
Umm, the author of
The Wee Compendium of Facts and Fun?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.366
Yeesh. Read a book.

04:01.908 --> 04:02.743
This one.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.163
Why would the author of a silly book
of children's rhymes

04:06.246 --> 04:07.664
know about the Crown of Souls?

04:07.748 --> 04:10.250
Because the book is where
we found out about the gem.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.211
I bet Miguel knows
all kinds of useful stuff.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.379
We have to go find him.

04:14.463 --> 04:18.175
Are you sure this is not just an excuse
for you to go meet your favorite author?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.635
Why would you think that?

04:20.719 --> 04:24.473
All I care about is figuring out
how the Crown of Souls works.

04:24.556 --> 04:28.059
And then, if we have the time,

04:28.143 --> 04:31.313
maybe telling him that I love him
and he's the best author ever,

04:31.396 --> 04:34.274
and oh, oh, oh,
I really want to meet him, Puss!

04:34.357 --> 04:38.945
Dulcinea, seeking the advice
of a children's author is a silly plan.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.032
As opposed to my plan:
yelling at the crown until it talks.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.909
Tell us what you know! Do it now!

04:43.992 --> 04:45.327
Ha-ha!

04:45.952 --> 04:47.496
Yeah, good luck with that, Puss.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.582
Oh, you think I'm angry now, Crown?

04:50.665 --> 04:53.460
Wait till you see what I am like
if I do not have my afternoon leche!

04:55.837 --> 04:57.005
Oh, it's so exciting!

04:57.088 --> 05:01.468
I bet Miguel's in a big mansion
with an amazing library full of books!

05:01.551 --> 05:03.136
And he'll give me
all kinds of nifty advice

05:03.220 --> 05:04.846
about how to live my life better.

05:04.930 --> 05:09.017
Oh, what a wonderful and kind person
Miguel is, in my mind,

05:09.100 --> 05:10.977
and therefore also in real life.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.687
Oh.

05:13.939 --> 05:14.856
Whee!

05:19.736 --> 05:20.570
What?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.041
This shack can't be his house.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.003
Maybe it's the servants' quarters?

05:45.262 --> 05:46.179
Oh.

05:47.973 --> 05:51.101
Hello, good sir, and how are you?
I'm obsessed with everything you do!

05:53.186 --> 05:54.312
Oh, hello...

05:54.396 --> 05:55.230
Oh!

05:59.067 --> 05:59.901
Hmm.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.031
Oh, hello...

06:08.994 --> 06:09.911
I'm looking for Mr....

06:15.208 --> 06:17.085
I have urgent business I need to discuss

06:17.168 --> 06:19.713
with the famous author
Miguel A. Andante.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.590
Ugh. That book.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.425
I know, right?
Greatest book ever written...

06:25.552 --> 06:26.386
So, is Miguel here?

06:26.469 --> 06:28.013
It's pronounced "Miguela."

06:29.264 --> 06:34.477
Umm, I think I know how to pronounce
my hero's name. It's...

06:34.728 --> 06:35.645
A misprint.

06:35.729 --> 06:40.692
One teensy mistake and "Miguela Andante"
turns into "Miguel A. Andante."

06:41.860 --> 06:43.737
Wait, so, you're...

06:46.239 --> 06:47.949
Excuse me.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.746
Miguel is Miguela, Miguela wrote the book.
Carry the one...

06:55.332 --> 06:58.168
Oh, my goodness!
You wrote the book!

06:58.251 --> 07:02.547
Oh, Mr... Oh, I mean, Ms. Andante.
You're my favorite author.

07:02.631 --> 07:06.343
I've read your book cover-to-cover
a thousand times!

07:09.304 --> 07:10.347
You're my hero.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.976
But what are you doing
in this cluttered old shack?

07:15.060 --> 07:17.395
Lighting the fireplace
to keep the pests out.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.647
Isn't it obvious?

07:19.648 --> 07:22.609
You can't just come right into
a total stranger's cluttered old shack!

07:22.692 --> 07:25.320
Oh, I didn't mean it
in a disrespectful way.

07:26.154 --> 07:30.659
"Though over the wide world you roam,
wherever you get stuck is home."

07:30.742 --> 07:31.910
The wisdom of the book.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.245
Did you really just quote
my own book to me?

07:34.329 --> 07:37.207
Uh-huh. I do it all the time.
I've based my whole life on it.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.501
Look, cat, you seem great.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.421
And by "great," I mean "imbalanced."

07:47.467 --> 07:50.387
Sorry, that came out wrong.
What I meant was,

07:50.470 --> 07:52.514
"Get out of my house and never come back!"

07:52.597 --> 07:56.601
Oh, this is so us.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.436
So, the reason I came here today
is that I was hoping

07:58.520 --> 08:00.689
you could tell me something
about the Crown of Souls,

08:00.772 --> 08:02.899
which you mention
on page 572 of your book.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.985
You see, my town is in grave danger and...

08:05.068 --> 08:06.236
Not interested!

08:06.319 --> 08:08.822
Do I look like the kind of person
who should be helping people?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.533
Oh. But you wrote the book.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.743
Look, kid, let's be serious.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.538
That book is the worst thing
that's ever been written.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.081
It's literally garbage.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.582
What's that?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.376
Oh.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.336
It sounded like you said the book is...

08:23.420 --> 08:24.629
Literally garbage.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.508
"Garbage"?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.392
Did you know that you look depressed?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.644
It is Dulcinea.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.523
I cannot explain it, but I feel
that something has gone horribly wrong.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.526
Also, between you and me...

08:48.528 --> 08:51.990
...my plan to yell at the Crown of Souls
until it talks has yielded no results.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.993
Did you know that crowns don't have ears?

08:55.076 --> 08:58.163
Or mouths? Or brains? Or...

08:58.246 --> 08:59.289
You are right.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.041
This is no time for inaction.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.294
I will go save Dulcinea
from whatever cruel fate has befallen her.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.088
Thank you, Vina,
for helping me realize this.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.006
I go!

09:09.340 --> 09:11.676
Did you know that I didn't do anything?

09:18.099 --> 09:20.643
How can you say
you don't like your own words?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.103
You wrote them.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.023
Open your eyes! That book is a joke!

09:25.106 --> 09:28.026
I wrote it as a cash grab.
A way to make a quick buck.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.360
You don't mean that.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.363
I was a best-selling author
until I wrote it.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.158
Everybody said self-help books
were easy money,

09:35.241 --> 09:36.576
so I banged one out.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.328
And do you know how many copies it sold?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.372
One!

09:41.456 --> 09:44.292
One copy.
Worst-selling book in history.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.461
After that,
I couldn't get published anywhere.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.338
I was ruined! Ruined!

09:48.421 --> 09:50.423
It wasn't the book's fault!

09:50.924 --> 09:53.259
I wish I'd never written
that filthy thing.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.304
No. No, no, no, no.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.431
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

09:58.515 --> 10:00.308
And if you've based
your entire life on it,

10:00.391 --> 10:04.062
then every decision you've ever made
in your whole life is wrong!

10:04.145 --> 10:06.606
And bad! And dumb!

10:11.444 --> 10:13.696
That isn't true!

10:14.697 --> 10:16.116
Oh, I have had enough of you.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.201
Get out of my house.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.957
No! Not until you apologize.

10:24.040 --> 10:24.958
Apologize?

10:25.542 --> 10:28.753
You're the one that broke into my house
with this book full of fiddlefuff!

10:30.088 --> 10:31.172
What did you say?

10:31.756 --> 10:33.216
What? Fiddlefuff?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.969
As in, "That book is fiddlefuff"?

10:36.052 --> 10:39.180
Ugh. This is my shack,
and I'll say whatever I want.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.890
Fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff!

10:40.974 --> 10:42.559
Fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff!

10:43.059 --> 10:48.106
Fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff,
fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff, fiddlefuff...

10:48.189 --> 10:51.526
Do I look like the kind of person
who should be helping people?

10:51.609 --> 10:54.654
Look, kid, that book is the worst thing
that's ever been written.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.572
That book is a joke!

10:55.655 --> 10:58.032
Open your eyes! It's literally garbage!

10:58.116 --> 10:59.284
Garbage!

11:00.160 --> 11:00.994
Garbage!

11:09.544 --> 11:10.920
Oh, fiddlefuff.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.768
Do not fear, Dulcinea.
I am on my way to rescue you.

11:26.728 --> 11:30.398
Also, I understand that it is unlikely
that you can hear me. But still.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.401
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.987
Oh, my gosh. What have I done?
What have I done?

11:36.487 --> 11:38.907
Miguela, this is so unlike me.
Oh, help me.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.451
You're the wisest person I know.
What should I do?

11:43.453 --> 11:46.456
You should untie me. Right now.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.708
I should untie you. Good idea.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.335
Oh, it'll be like this never happened.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.837
Eh, don't beat yourself up about it.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.256
This is what I get
for writing a stupid book.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.799
Stupid fans.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.346
It's not a stupid book!

12:01.429 --> 12:02.889
It's your crowning achievement.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.850
The greatest artistic work
ever produced by anyone ever!

12:05.934 --> 12:08.227
In fact, it's so good,
you should write a sequel.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.982
Oh, my gosh, you're gonna write a sequel!

12:13.566 --> 12:14.400
What?

12:14.943 --> 12:15.777
Don't you see?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.446
The universe sent me here today
to help you start writing again.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.614
It's fate!

12:20.865 --> 12:23.534
This is rapidly becoming
my least favorite day ever.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.168
Puss in-a the Boots!

12:32.752 --> 12:36.047
My name is a-Silvio, and I'm a big fan.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.009
Which is why I'm-a gonna be so sad
when I cut you in two, ah?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.679
Ha! I would like to see you a-try.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.264
Silvio not-a gonna cut you in two.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.517
A-Giuseppe is!

12:49.143 --> 12:51.020
And your accents are so charming!

12:51.104 --> 12:52.897
Ha-ha!

12:54.941 --> 12:56.859
I am guessing
you are not from around here.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.113
No, we come from-a far away

13:00.196 --> 13:02.782
just to fight you and-a make-a mama proud.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.075
Oh, Mama.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.368
Then fight we shall!

13:09.497 --> 13:10.623
For Mama!

13:12.583 --> 13:13.835
Look at this cat!

13:17.755 --> 13:19.007
But tell me this.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.927
What are a couple of out-of-town thieves
such as yourselves doing in these woods?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.972
Hmm?

13:26.973 --> 13:28.599
I really should learn
to ask questions first,

13:28.683 --> 13:30.143
knock thieves unconscious second.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.310
Huh?

13:33.229 --> 13:34.355
Hmm.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.029
A bounty on my head?

13:42.113 --> 13:43.698
A bounty on my head!

13:43.781 --> 13:44.866
Huzzah!

13:45.241 --> 13:48.036
Unconscious thieves,
do you realize what this means?

13:48.119 --> 13:51.456
Getting a bounty put on one's head
is one of the four pillars of heroism.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.500
There is kissing a princess,
defeating a skeleton army,

13:54.584 --> 13:56.627
getting a bounty put on one's head
by outlaws,

13:56.711 --> 13:58.296
and never acting like a dog.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.800
Oh, untie me, you hateful harpy!

14:03.926 --> 14:05.803
Uh-uh-uh, naughty-naughty.

14:05.887 --> 14:09.891
"Though cruel names you may call a friend,
you'll sure regret it in the end."

14:10.641 --> 14:11.642
The wisdom of the book.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.562
No! Spare me those horrible rhymes.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.689
They're so trite. So childish.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.399
You don't really like them, do you?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.694
No. I love 'em!

14:21.778 --> 14:23.029
Everyone does!

14:23.696 --> 14:26.157
Oh. Look, this is one of my favorites.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.994
"When life has thrown you for a loop,
just make yourself some nice hot soup!"

14:31.829 --> 14:33.331
That makes zero sense.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.876
I clearly put absolutely no effort
into writing that thing.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.629
Then it should be super easy
to write the sequel.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.422
Go ahead and start rhyming.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.299
Whenever you're ready.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.553
Never. I will never write
another rhyme again as long as I live!

14:51.099 --> 14:51.933
Hmm.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.193
What are you gonna do with that?

15:09.784 --> 15:11.911
There we go. Can't have you falling over.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.288
And now, some soup!

15:14.372 --> 15:16.999
Just like the book says, hot, tasty soup!

15:17.083 --> 15:18.376
Oh, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!

15:18.459 --> 15:20.711
The secret ingredient is friendship.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.215
And after I spoon-feed you, we'll write
lots and lots of rhymes together.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.686
I'm-a gonna claim-a the bounty
and-a buy my mama a new black veil,

15:36.769 --> 15:38.604
so she can mourn-a my papi even better!

15:43.776 --> 15:46.404
While this newfound fame
is quite flattering,

15:46.487 --> 15:47.822
that is a lot of thieves.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.783
- Write.
- No.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.453
- Do it.
- No!

15:53.536 --> 15:55.288
Take the quill. Take it and write.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.082
Just do it. Do it! Do it now! Do it now!

16:01.878 --> 16:03.379
Paper!

16:03.463 --> 16:04.630
Now, write!

16:07.758 --> 16:08.885
Oh.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.886
Oh, there you go.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.138
Isn't writing fun? It's so fun.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.557
Oh, we're such good friends
having such good times!

16:15.183 --> 16:16.350
Enough!

16:16.434 --> 16:18.811
You know, for someone who claims
to love my book so much,

16:18.895 --> 16:20.146
you sure don't act like it.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.732
What do you mean? I'm your biggest fan.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.192
I do everything the book says!

16:24.275 --> 16:25.318
Oh, really?

16:25.735 --> 16:31.616
"While we may like to have our druthers,
it's wrong to force our will on others."

16:32.617 --> 16:34.327
Oh, oh, I'm not forcing my will on anyone.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.412
Oh, I'm just trying to help you!

16:36.496 --> 16:41.542
"Though helping's what friends try to do,
they're capable of hurting too."

16:42.585 --> 16:46.672
Gasp!
She just called me her friend!

16:48.090 --> 16:53.137
"Crazy is as crazy does,
no matter what your intentions was."

16:53.221 --> 16:55.515
The wisdom of the book.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.099
Oh, my goodness.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.478
You're right. I have been crazy.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.146
Also, is that grammatically correct?

17:02.730 --> 17:03.606
No!

17:03.689 --> 17:06.192
It's what you get when you write
an entire book in a weekend.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.027
Now, stop this madness!

17:13.991 --> 17:16.827
Your book has meant
so much to me in my life.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.747
It's been a comfort,
it's been an inspiration.

17:19.829 --> 17:23.209
And the thought of someone like you
wasting all of her talent...

17:23.667 --> 17:26.170
I guess it was just too much
for me to handle.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.511
I mean, I suppose it's flattering

17:33.594 --> 17:36.389
that something I wrote
could be so influential to a person

17:36.472 --> 17:40.017
that she'd literally tie me to a chair
and hold me prisoner in my own house.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.187
It's what every young author dreams of.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.357
But you're a rare and loony bird,
Dulcinea.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.235
My book could never affect anyone else
the way it did you.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.152
That's not true.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.697
Your words would affect
anyone who heard them.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.991
You're wrong about that, Whiskers.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.952
Today's world doesn't want
poetry or sentiment.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.705
They just want action.
Action, all the time!

18:00.788 --> 18:03.207
People bursting in doors
with swords and shouting...

18:03.291 --> 18:04.125
Hmm?

18:04.709 --> 18:05.585
Dulcinea!

18:06.544 --> 18:07.587
See what I mean?

18:07.670 --> 18:08.504
Puss?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.548
Hello, Dulcinea. I have come to save you.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.800
Oh, look, you are fine. How wonderful.
Shall we go now?

18:12.883 --> 18:15.344
Save me? But I'm perfectly fine.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.638
Puss in-a the Boots!

18:30.943 --> 18:32.653
Puss, what did you do?

18:32.737 --> 18:33.904
Got a bounty put on my head,

18:33.988 --> 18:36.324
which, I have learned, is not the fun time
it is cracked up to be.

18:36.407 --> 18:39.493
Now, wait inside
while I deny these gentlemen their bounty.

18:39.577 --> 18:43.706
Oh, mamma-mia! This is a-taking forever!

18:43.789 --> 18:46.500
Okay, who's first?

19:07.772 --> 19:09.732
Whoa!

19:09.815 --> 19:10.900
Yes!

19:16.572 --> 19:18.908
Chicolini, you did-a real good.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.118
Now, I take him off-a your hands

19:21.202 --> 19:23.204
and I bring him back-a
to the Thieves' Market.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.830
Uno minuto, Silvio.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.499
Why you get-a to take him, huh?

19:26.582 --> 19:29.251
Me, I'm-a thinking
that I a-get to take him!

19:29.335 --> 19:31.962
You try to take him,
I'm-a break-a you face!

19:32.046 --> 19:34.674
Hey! What about a-me, Chicolini?

19:34.757 --> 19:37.301
- Or-a me? A-Francesco!
- Orvieto!

19:37.385 --> 19:38.886
It really is a beautiful language.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.347
Should we do something?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.848
Nah, probably not, right?

19:42.932 --> 19:45.476
Doing nothing sounds way easier
than doing something.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.603
I have to help him.

19:49.021 --> 19:53.275
"Even if it means a fight,
we must always do what's right."

19:53.859 --> 19:55.194
The wisdom of the book.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.534
Your book.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.881
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

20:18.676 --> 20:20.761
Capo Ferro!

20:21.929 --> 20:23.097
Hi-yah!

20:31.897 --> 20:33.441
"Hearken, bandits,

20:33.524 --> 20:34.942
- strong and bold."
- Huh?

20:35.025 --> 20:37.611
"A crucial truth, you'll now be told.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.947
Although you trade in brawn and might,

20:40.030 --> 20:43.367
you may still choose to do what's right.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.578
It's wrong that no one ever asks

20:45.661 --> 20:49.123
what kindness hides behind those masks.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.042
For sure as there's a sky above..."

20:52.126 --> 20:55.087
- "...you each are capable of love."
- Aww.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.215
Mama's still got it.

21:00.634 --> 21:04.889
Strega scrittore,
she speak-a the rhyming truth!

21:04.972 --> 21:07.016
I got-a the love in my heart.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.810
I no wanna chop-a nobody up!

21:15.816 --> 21:19.820
Miguela, you saved our lives.
With the power of your words.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.240
Yes. That was very impressive stuff.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.409
The bandits were certainly moved by it.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.328
Allergies.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.247
Incidentally, I'm Puss in Boots.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.248
Couldn't care less.

21:31.332 --> 21:34.001
- Gah!
- Oh, thank you, Miguela. Thank you.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.254
Nope. Not ready to be held
against my will by you again just yet.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.966
So, did you learn all the information
we need about the Crown of Souls?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.135
Oh. Right. The crown.

21:43.219 --> 21:46.180
Umm, actually,
I guess I got a little too distracted

21:46.263 --> 21:49.433
letting Miguela know
how I'm her number one fan.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.939
Truth is, everything in the Wee Compendium
about the Crown of Souls,

21:55.022 --> 21:56.899
I totally stole from another book.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.692
Which is in my library.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.070
In my former house. The mansion.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.947
From before I lost all my money.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.367
And that mansion is now occupied
by a horrible monster.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.618
Excellent.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.996
So, we shall simply go to this mansion
and retrieve the book.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.165
Easy-peasy, offshore-breezy.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.336
Did you hear the thing I just said
about the horrible monster?

22:17.920 --> 22:18.838
Nope.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.215
Oh, wait. Yes, I did. Hmm.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.008
Oh, another monster?

22:23.884 --> 22:26.637
Well, Capo Ferro!

22:27.763 --> 22:28.681
Capo Ferro.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.267
Ooh, and while we're on our way
to fight this monster,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.769
we can help Miguela
start writing her new book!

22:33.852 --> 22:35.396
Don't push it, Crazy.
