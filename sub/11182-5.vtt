* Well, we're movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:04.367 --> 00:07.200
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:07.267 --> 00:11.533

* Movin' on up

00:14.667 --> 00:17.767
* To the East Side

00:17.833 --> 00:23.367
* We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.433 --> 00:26.000
* Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.067 --> 00:28.633
* Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.700 --> 00:31.233
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.300 --> 00:33.833
* Just to get up that hill

00:33.900 --> 00:36.433
* Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.500 --> 00:39.000
* Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.067 --> 00:41.500
* As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.567 --> 00:43.233
* There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.300 --> 00:46.033
* We're movin' on up

* We finally got
a piece of the pie *

01:10.633 --> 01:13.233
Look, I'm telling you,
Hawkins,
you can't go wrong

01:13.300 --> 01:16.000
giving me your business.
I got stores
all over the city.

01:16.067 --> 01:20.300
-Twenty.
-Nope. Only seven.
But I plan to open some more.

01:20.367 --> 01:23.133
Oh, no, no, Jefferson,
I was counting my exercises.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.600
-Ahhh!
-Oh, look out! Look out!

01:27.200 --> 01:28.933
-(PHONE BUZZING)
-Thanks.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.200
Hey, if it wasn't for you,
I'd have dropped my drawers.
(LAUGHING)

01:35.633 --> 01:38.100
Yeah, Linda? What?
Oh, yeah, well look.

01:38.167 --> 01:41.100
Tell Wilson I'll have an
answer for him as soon as I go
to file on the Bronx store.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.333
Right. Bye.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.767
(GRUNTING)
21.

02:02.467 --> 02:07.167
Great little item, huh?
Helps me keep my arms in
shape for all the girls.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.200
If there's one thing
I believe in,
it's keeping in shape.

02:09.267 --> 02:10.967
Yeah?

02:11.033 --> 02:12.933
Say, how about you
and me getting together
tomorrow morning, Jefferson?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.667
Oh, sure. I'd love to go
out for breakfast.

02:14.733 --> 02:17.100
-No, no, no.
I mean to jog.
-Jog? Well, uh...

02:17.167 --> 02:20.400
Yeah, we could take in a
little five mile run.

02:20.467 --> 02:24.267
Oh, darn. I just remembered
I promised to take my wife
shopping tomorrow.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.367
Shopping?
At 6:00 in the morning?

02:26.433 --> 02:30.100
Oh, yeah, well see Weezy
likes to beat the crowd.

02:30.167 --> 02:34.500
Look, I'm telling you now, I
can beat any price your hotel
pays for laundry service.

02:34.567 --> 02:37.367
Well, that sounds good.
Why don't you quote me a price
and we'll talk about it.

02:37.433 --> 02:39.033
Now here's what
you're gonna need.

02:39.100 --> 02:42.333
Number of towels,
number of sheets,
number of uniforms...

02:42.400 --> 02:46.967
What's this number?
Oh, it's a phone number.
You won't be needing that.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.300
-She'll have all she
can handle with me tonight.
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

02:50.367 --> 02:53.600
-Right, Jefferson?
Oops, you okay?
-(CHOKING)

02:53.667 --> 02:56.767
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just working a little
hard lately.

02:56.833 --> 02:59.067
-Yeah.
-But that's what you gotta
do to stay on top, right?

02:59.133 --> 03:03.833
Wrong. A little work,
a little play. To stay on top
you gotta have balance.

03:03.900 --> 03:07.400
That's what I meant.
I've been working hard
at balancing the books.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.067
Look, I'll have a price
for you in a minute.

03:12.133 --> 03:15.633
-What's that?
-(WATCH BEEPING)
Quittin' time.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.900
-Say what?
-I never work past 6:00.

03:17.967 --> 03:21.000
-Hey, but I'm almost
done here!
-Well, I'm sorry, Jefferson.

03:21.067 --> 03:26.400
This is my time to play, and
man, have I got a playmate
waiting for me tonight.

03:26.467 --> 03:30.133
* Got a date with an angel
gonna meet her at seven *

03:30.200 --> 03:34.633
-Wait, I got a figure!
-My girl's got a better one.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.967
-Hey, what about the
contract?
-Tomorrow, Jefferson.

03:37.033 --> 03:39.533
All work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy.

03:41.900 --> 03:46.667
-It also makes
Jack a lot of jack, Jack!
-(PHONE BUZZING)

03:46.733 --> 03:50.567
Yeah, Linda.
What! Why ain't he
workin' in the store?

03:51.500 --> 03:55.033
-Okay, send him in.
-Mr. Jefferson?

03:55.100 --> 03:58.333
What are you doing here,
Leroy? The store's open
till 7:00.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.600
Well, don't worry.
I put out the
Closed for Vacation sign.

04:01.667 --> 04:05.000
What? People will think
we're closed for
the whole week!

04:05.067 --> 04:08.167
-You should have used the
Out to Lunch sign.
-Yeah, I thought of that.

04:08.233 --> 04:11.333
But it's 6:00.
Too late for lunch.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.300
Ain't no vacation either,
but your brain's taking one.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.667
I came over to tell you
the van broke down.

04:17.733 --> 04:20.400
-Well, why didn't you just
call me on the phone?
-I thought of that.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.667
But the messenger
dropped these off.

04:22.733 --> 04:26.300
-You should have told the
messenger to bring them here.
-I thought of that.

04:26.367 --> 04:30.667
-But I was comin' over anyway
to tell you about the van.
-Look, forget about it, Leroy.

04:30.733 --> 04:34.400
Just get back
to the store fast.
Here, take a cab.

04:34.467 --> 04:37.667
Okay. But who's gonna
drive the van back?

04:37.733 --> 04:40.767
-What? I thought you said
it wasn't runnin'!
-Well, it wasn't.

04:40.833 --> 04:43.233
But I fixed it
just before I left.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.633
Then why'd you bother to come?

04:47.700 --> 04:50.867
'Cause I had to deliver
those dumb things.

04:50.933 --> 04:54.067
They ain't dumb things.
They're financial reports.

04:54.133 --> 04:57.167
My accountant sends them
to me so I know what's
going on in my business.

04:57.233 --> 04:59.400
Gee, I can tell you that.

04:59.467 --> 05:04.200
This morning, a man brought in
three suits, a leather jacket,
and then a woman came in

05:04.267 --> 05:07.300
-with some drapes...
-Never mind, Leroy.
Just get back to the store.

05:08.467 --> 05:11.300
-Right.
-Hey, wait a minute.

05:11.367 --> 05:15.367
-What about the cab money?
-Ah, forget it.
I'm driving the van back.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.967
Man, how can
a normal sized head
hold so much stupid?

05:25.067 --> 05:28.167
Mr. Jefferson,
will you be
needing me tonight?

05:28.233 --> 05:31.933
Let me see.
I gotta work up a price, then
I gotta go over these reports.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.967
You'll be needing me tonight.
I guess I better
get us something to eat.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.600
-Yeah, I guess you better.
-What do you want?

05:37.667 --> 05:41.300
-Hawkins' business.
-I don't think the deli
carries that.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.333
-Then make it a
Tom Willis sandwich.
-Pardon?

05:44.400 --> 05:48.967
-Turkey on white.
-I'll be back
in a few minutes.

05:49.033 --> 05:50.033
(CHUCKLES)

05:50.867 --> 05:52.833
(PHONE RINGING)

05:55.800 --> 05:59.933
Jefferson Cleaners...
Huh?
Oh, hi, Weezy.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.167
What?
No, I can't tonight.
I gotta work.

06:04.233 --> 06:07.867
Yeah, I know we had a
date for dinner, but this
is more important.

06:07.933 --> 06:12.733
Well, of course I love you,
Weezy... I know, but...

06:12.800 --> 06:17.200
Yeah... Yeah, but...
Look, don't wait for me.

06:17.267 --> 06:21.633
I got to work, and that's it.
Okay? Bye. Whew!

06:21.700 --> 06:23.700
Don't you understand?

06:23.767 --> 06:27.233
It's hard work that put me
here, and it's hard work
that's gonna keep me here.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.567
And if I'm here, how can I be
out with you for dinner?
Huh?

06:32.433 --> 06:33.833
(YAWNING)

06:41.267 --> 06:44.767
(HUMMING)
Weezy, I'm home!

06:46.400 --> 06:51.033
-Weezy! Florence?
-LOUISE: Florence?

06:53.100 --> 06:54.900
I'm comin'.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.133
Florence, is that you?

07:02.200 --> 07:07.433
-Florence, do me a favor,
will you?
-Weezy, is that you?

07:07.500 --> 07:10.633
-Can you help me
with this?
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, I get it.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.667
They're having a costume
party at the Health Center,

07:12.733 --> 07:16.433
and you're both dressed up
like Miss Jane Pittman.
(LAUGHING)

07:20.367 --> 07:23.100
Sure is a fancy dress,
Miss Jefferson.

07:23.167 --> 07:27.433
Well, Florence, it's not
every night you celebrate
a 25th anniversary.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.800
What are you talking
about, Weezy? We've been
married longer than that.

07:30.867 --> 07:35.167
Time sure flies.
It seemed like just yesterday
I started working here.

07:35.233 --> 07:39.267
Wrong.
You still haven't started.

07:39.333 --> 07:45.300
Can you believe it?
The Jefferson Cleaners
still around after 25 years?

07:45.367 --> 07:48.333
What are you talking about,
Weezy? I've only had
those stores eight years.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.100
-Thank you, Florence.
-You're welcome.

07:50.167 --> 07:53.733
-Damn it, Weezy, will you
say something?
-Did you chill the champagne?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.533
-What champagne?
-Yeah, it's in the
'frigerator.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.200
Now just relax.
The party's gonna be fine.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.767
What party?
What's going on?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.267
Weezy, answer me!

08:07.933 --> 08:10.167
What the hell's goin' on
around here?

08:12.367 --> 08:16.067
Maybe the newspaper
will say something
since nobody else can.

08:16.133 --> 08:19.633
Weezy, I was getting ready
to look at the paper,
if you don't mind. Damn...

08:24.367 --> 08:29.033
"Carter Promises Tax Relief."
That's all he's gonna do,
too, is promise.

08:29.100 --> 08:34.600
"At a special news conference
today, President Amy Carter
under..." Amy Carter?

08:39.900 --> 08:43.400
Tuesday, November 23rd, 1996!

08:45.367 --> 08:49.433
Oh, I got it! It's a dream!

08:51.467 --> 08:56.133
I can see them, but they
can't see me. Hey,
I'm dreaming about my future.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.733
Oh! All right!

09:01.767 --> 09:06.033
Jefferson Cleaners
is still around.
Weezy still looks terrific.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.567
Hey, this is great.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.300
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-Shoot!

09:14.267 --> 09:16.400
Ah, Mrs. J.

09:22.700 --> 09:27.900
Felicitations are certainly
apropos on this
momentous occasion.

09:27.967 --> 09:31.133
Bentley still ain't learned
how to speak English.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.667
-Oh, Mr. Bentley,
come in.
-Thank you.

09:34.733 --> 09:39.267
-I have some wine
for the celebration.
-Oh, thank you, Mr. Bentley.

09:39.333 --> 09:43.633
It's a quite rare vintage.
I had a hard time
finding anything that old.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.433
You seen Florence lately?
(LAUGHING)

09:46.500 --> 09:52.333
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-This is old. 1978!

09:52.400 --> 09:56.300
-Oh, hello, Helen.
-Happy anniversary, Louise.

09:56.367 --> 10:00.267
Oh, thank you.
Oh, where's Tom?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.633
Yeah, where's the other
half of the zebra?

10:04.500 --> 10:08.000
-Right behind me.
-That's exactly where his
half belongs.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.433
Damn it, Helen,
not so fast!

10:19.100 --> 10:22.333
Willis, if I looked as
bad as you did,
I'd wake myself up.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.900
-Did you say something,
dear?
-No, Tom.

10:26.967 --> 10:29.200
I did, you big honky!

10:31.900 --> 10:36.567
Hey, watch what you're doin'!
You almost squashed me!

10:38.467 --> 10:41.533
Tom, Tom,
remember our diet.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.367
-Uh, what? Did you say
something, dear?
-She said you're too fat!

10:46.900 --> 10:49.467
-Naughty, naughty.
-Oh, Helen...

10:56.500 --> 10:59.367
-Anybody want a drink?
-I'd love one.

10:59.433 --> 11:03.033
-Funny how Tom always
hears that one word.
-What word?

11:03.100 --> 11:06.467
-Drink.
-No, thanks. Florence is
already getting me one.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.700
Wait, Florence.
How about some champagne?

11:11.767 --> 11:14.800
Good idea.
Y'all want some, too?

11:17.067 --> 11:20.567
-Florence...
-Just kiddin', Miss Jefferson.
(CACKLING)

11:24.200 --> 11:29.300
Oh, Louise, we're so excited
tonight. Imagine 25 years
in the same business!

11:29.367 --> 11:34.133
Things have turned out
well. And I thank you all
for coming.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.667
You're lucky she's the one
that did the inviting!

11:37.400 --> 11:39.167
Ah!

11:41.900 --> 11:43.067
Hey!

11:46.967 --> 11:51.200
Damn! I can't even get
a drink in my own dream?

11:51.267 --> 11:53.733
-This calls for a toast.
-(ALL AGREEING)

11:55.633 --> 11:57.433
Friends and neighbors,

11:57.500 --> 12:00.400
we gather here tonight to
celebrate the silver
anniversary of the

12:00.467 --> 12:02.400
-Jefferson Cleaners.
-Here, here.

12:02.467 --> 12:03.800
Oh, I haven't finished.

12:05.733 --> 12:12.533
25 years ago, George Jefferson
was just a poor, determined,
hard-working...

12:12.600 --> 12:14.400
Don't forget good-lookin'.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.267
-...very small man
with a dream.
-Hey, hey!

12:18.333 --> 12:20.300
It started with one
small store,

12:20.367 --> 12:24.733
and grew into a prosperous
chain of 20 outlets
all over this city.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.800
Twenty stores?
See that, Weezy?

12:26.867 --> 12:28.667
I told you all that hard work
would pay off.

12:28.733 --> 12:32.833
-And so it is with great honor
and respect that I say...
-(SNORING)

12:34.500 --> 12:36.667
Oh, huh?
Oh, hear, hear...

12:36.733 --> 12:40.533
Here's to the
Jefferson Cleaners,
a dream come true.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.033
Thank goodness.

12:46.267 --> 12:50.700
-Oh, what's wrong, Louise?
-I was just thinking.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.967
I wish George had
lived to see this day.

13:03.367 --> 13:06.833
Weezy, what do you mean
you wished I had lived?
You're talking like I was...

13:06.900 --> 13:09.933
Dead!
Damn batteries must be dead!

13:11.700 --> 13:14.967
Shut up, Willis!
I'm not dead,
I'm right here. Look!

13:15.033 --> 13:18.400
-Girl, we're all really
proud of you.
-I'm not dead!

13:18.467 --> 13:23.967
Indeed, Mrs. J.
You rallied beautifully after
Mr. J's untimely passing.

13:24.033 --> 13:26.000
Untimely passing?
What happened?

13:26.067 --> 13:31.233
-I didn't have much choice.
It happened so suddenly.
-How, Weezy? How...

13:31.300 --> 13:35.400
-How many years has it
been, Louise?
-Yeah, how many?

13:35.467 --> 13:39.233
-Let's see. It's going on...
-How long! How long?

13:39.300 --> 13:41.100
-Seven years!
-Seven years?

13:41.167 --> 13:43.733
These batteries are
supposed to last seven years!

13:47.800 --> 13:53.100
Will you shut up, Willis?
We're talking about me dying,
not your dumb batteries!

13:53.167 --> 13:56.400
-We'll worry about it
tomorrow, dear.
-Ah.

13:56.467 --> 14:02.267
The first year was the worst.
After that, I managed to
adjust to life without George.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.067
-You did?
-Yeah, it took me a while
to adjust, too.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.367
It wasn't easy getting used
to all that quiet.

14:07.433 --> 14:09.333
That's enough out of you.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.533
George may have yelled at
you a lot, Florence, but
deep down he really liked you.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.867
No, I didn't.

14:18.633 --> 14:21.633
Well, actually, I do kind
of miss the little fella.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.067
And I know that Tom
misses George, too.

14:27.133 --> 14:31.267
Why, it's been years since
anybody's called him honky.

14:31.333 --> 14:37.600
-Honky, honky, honky, honky!
-Did someone call me?

14:37.667 --> 14:41.033
-No, dear.
You must have been dreaming.
-Oh...

14:41.100 --> 14:46.533
I missed George at first,
then one morning I woke
up and said to myself,

14:46.600 --> 14:52.600
"Hell, Louise, it wasn't you
who kicked the bucket!
Get out there and enjoy life."

14:52.667 --> 14:55.333
-Right on, girl.
-Weezy, what are you saying?

14:55.400 --> 15:00.400
-And from that day on, I
haven't stopped going.
-Going where?

15:00.467 --> 15:04.533
I'll say. Remember that
year in Hawaii. Oh!

15:04.600 --> 15:06.700
Yes, those winters in
the Caribbean.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.467
And don't forget
that two year cruise
around the world.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.267
What did you do, Weezy?
Join the Harlem Globetrotters?

15:14.900 --> 15:17.900
-Well, I could use
a bit of fresh air.
-Me, too.

15:17.967 --> 15:22.900
-Good idea. Come on, Tom.
Maybe it'll wake him up.
-Huh? Oh...

15:22.967 --> 15:25.567
Well, I'm not going out
there without something
to keep me warm.

15:36.333 --> 15:40.433
-What a beautiful night,
eh, Florence?
-Uh-huh. Sure is clear.

15:40.500 --> 15:44.300
-Yeah. You can see clear
to the next building.
-Wake up, Tom.

15:44.367 --> 15:49.400
Huh? What? Oh, look!
A flying saucer!

15:49.467 --> 15:52.033
-A what? Where?
-There! There!

15:52.100 --> 15:55.733
Watch the cane!
Ohhh!

15:59.833 --> 16:02.400
Oh, never mind.
It was just a mosquito.

16:04.800 --> 16:09.400
You have to be more careful,
Tom. You nearly knocked over
Florence's drink.

16:09.467 --> 16:10.500
Love one.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.133
Oh, it's chilly out here.
I think I'll go back inside.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.700
Me, too.
Thought champagne was
supposed to keep you warm.

16:22.033 --> 16:26.200
Ha! What a fall!
(LAUGHING) Hey, you should
have seen me, Weezy.

16:26.267 --> 16:30.533
I fell 12 floors,
straight down, and didn't
get a scratch. Look.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.633
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-I landed on this awning, then
I bounced out into the street

16:34.700 --> 16:40.233
and three cabs ran over me
before I even got up.
Doesn't anybody care?

16:42.867 --> 16:47.467
-Ralph, what a surprise!
-Hello, Mrs. Jefferson,
ma'am.

16:47.533 --> 16:52.733
Ralph? Damn!
You must be opening some
pretty fancy doors these days.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.433
I couldn't let the anniversary
of Jefferson Cleaners slip by

16:56.500 --> 16:59.167
without offering you
my congratulations.

16:59.233 --> 17:01.767
Look out, Weezy,
he wants a tip.

17:01.833 --> 17:06.400
I wanted to give you a nice
gift. But what could a woman
of your wealth possibly need?

17:06.467 --> 17:10.533
So I decided on something with
a sentimental value.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.467
That means he got you
something cheap.

17:13.533 --> 17:20.067
This hat is the hat I was
wearing when you moved into
the building 22 years ago.

17:20.933 --> 17:24.600
Oh, Ralph, thank you.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.867
I thought you might have it
bronzed to always
remember me by.

17:27.933 --> 17:32.033
It'd be better if we
bronzed your hand.
We've seen more of that.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.067
It's the least I can do,
Mrs. Jefferson.

17:34.133 --> 17:38.300
If it hadn't been for all your
husband's tips, I never could
have bought this building.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.467
Bought this building!
Are you jivin'?

17:42.533 --> 17:47.467
Well, I've got to run.
My limousine
is double parked.

17:47.533 --> 17:53.067
-Limousine?
-I forgot, I brought your
mail up from downstairs.

17:53.133 --> 17:56.433
-Old habits are hard to break.
-Oh, thank you.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.900
Ralph, you want a tip
from me?

18:06.967 --> 18:14.367
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Jefferson.
Like I said,
old habits are hard to break.

18:14.433 --> 18:17.333
Oh, wait, Ralph.
Wait right there.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.367
-Here, for old time's sake.
-Thank you, Mrs. Jefferson.

18:25.633 --> 18:29.900
$500? Now that's
a full tank of gas!

18:31.067 --> 18:32.433
Goodbye, everybody.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.033
(INAUDIBLE)

18:35.100 --> 18:38.167
Ooh, Louise, you really
throw the money around.

18:38.233 --> 18:41.867
Well, George left me
more than I could
possibly get rid of.

18:41.933 --> 18:44.133
You don't have to
give it away, Weezy!

18:44.200 --> 18:49.867
You know, somehow I've
got the feeling he's
looking down at us right now.

18:49.933 --> 18:53.533
That's funny.
I always kind of pictured
him lookin' up at us.

18:59.233 --> 19:03.267
Well, I guess it's time
to let you all
in on a surprise.

19:03.333 --> 19:08.200
-I've decided to sell
the business.
-Weezy, are you crazy?

19:08.267 --> 19:10.933
I worked myself to death
in those stores!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Who's buying the
business, Miss Jefferson?

19:13.067 --> 19:16.900
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-The same person who's been
running it all these years.

19:16.967 --> 19:20.800
My brilliant general manager,
Leroy!

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Oh, no...

19:26.700 --> 19:30.567
-You know everyone here.
-Miss, Miss Willis.
Hello, Florence.

19:30.633 --> 19:35.167
Leroy, I wanna thank you for
doing such a wonderful job.
-Oh...

19:35.233 --> 19:38.600
That birdbrain don't know
nothin' about runnin'
a business.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.500
There really isn't much
to it, Mrs. Jefferson.

19:41.567 --> 19:45.133
Once you balance
the incoming credits
with the outgoing debits,

19:45.200 --> 19:50.233
then all you have to do is
combine the tangible assets to
the existing profit margin,

19:50.300 --> 19:52.233
to accrue a
substantial cash flow

19:52.300 --> 19:55.233
at a current international
monetary exchange rate.

20:02.100 --> 20:07.867
Well, I hope Jefferson
Cleaners brings you as
many rewards as it has me.

20:07.933 --> 20:09.833
Weezy, they're my stores!

20:09.900 --> 20:11.967
They are all yours, Leroy.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.133
Thank you, Mrs. Jefferson.

20:14.200 --> 20:19.467
Well, I better get back and
take that Closed for Vacation
sign out of the window!

20:21.533 --> 20:22.600
Weezy...

20:22.667 --> 20:25.233
And the rest of my
surprise is

20:25.300 --> 20:29.200
that I am leaving for a cruise
around the world in
just a few minutes!

20:29.267 --> 20:32.533
-Another cruise?
-But this time,
I'm going with a friend.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.833
-Anyone we know, Louise?
-You'll see.
He should be here any minute.

20:36.900 --> 20:41.433
* Got a date with an angel
gotta meet her at seven *

20:41.500 --> 20:44.733
-Who's that singing?
-Oh, it's my Romeo.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.433
Sounds like he's
coming over the terrace.

20:47.833 --> 20:48.867
Romeo?

20:48.933 --> 20:53.700
* ...beside me
and whatever betide me

20:53.767 --> 21:00.600
* Got an angel to guide me
and I'm on my way to heaven *

21:00.667 --> 21:04.367
Goodness, you have
a long climb ahead of you.

21:04.433 --> 21:06.633
Would you care to
stop here for some tea?

21:11.967 --> 21:18.000
-Louise, darling.
-Brian, darling.

21:18.067 --> 21:21.367
Darling? Nigger,
get your hands off my wife!

21:27.233 --> 21:31.067
Doesn't Brian look
terrific for his age?

21:31.133 --> 21:34.300
Brian looks terrific
for any age.

21:34.367 --> 21:37.733
Oh, yeah? You wait till you
see how he looks when
I'm finished with him.

21:37.800 --> 21:42.000
Girls, I learned a long time
ago, that if you wanna beat
life at its own game,

21:42.067 --> 21:46.333
you've got to stop along
the way and smell the roses.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.633
Amen!

21:53.933 --> 21:57.433
If only George had
followed that advice
he'd be alive today.

21:58.633 --> 22:01.900
-Well, ready to play, babe?
-Sure am.

22:01.967 --> 22:04.233
Your playing days
are all over, turkey!

22:04.300 --> 22:08.600
Good. 'Cause I can't wait
to be on a slow boat with you.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.167
Oh, yeah? Wait till you see
what I'm gonna do to you!

22:14.367 --> 22:18.800
-You know, there's a
slight draft in here?
-Hey!

22:18.867 --> 22:22.500
-Well, see you all in a year.
-(BANGING ON WINDOW)
Hey!

22:22.567 --> 22:24.533
-Goodbye, Mrs. J.
-Bon voyage.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.067
-Wave goodbye,
wave goodbye.
-Bon voyage.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.600
(BANGING)
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
I'll kill him!

22:36.833 --> 22:39.500
-I'll kill him!
-Jefferson, are you all
right? You all right?

22:39.567 --> 22:43.233
-Hawkins, get your dirty
hands off me!
-I forgot my keys.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.833
I've got an 8:00 reservation
at Chez Jacques, so I came...

22:45.900 --> 22:48.067
-I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you!
-Jefferson...

22:48.133 --> 22:51.033
-You're crazy, Jefferson.
-I'm gonna kill you!

22:51.100 --> 22:52.667
Mr. Jefferson,
what's the matter?

22:52.733 --> 22:55.333
Can you believe that
jive turkey tried to
run off with my wife?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.667
Run off with your wife?
I thought he was
here about the contract.

22:57.733 --> 23:00.800
-What contract?
What day is it?
-Tuesday.

23:00.867 --> 23:02.167
-What year?
-Huh?

23:02.233 --> 23:07.200
-Oh, my God! Hawkins!
-Man, he's gone.

23:07.267 --> 23:12.033
Oh, how could I be so
stupid? But it seemed so real.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.300
I just dreamed Weezy ran off
with that Brian.

23:14.367 --> 23:18.500
-And where were you?
-I was dead from
working so hard.

23:18.567 --> 23:21.767
Oh. Well, here's your
sandwich. I'll be at my
desk if you need me.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.933
-Oh, you can go home, Linda.
-But I thought
we were working late.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.500
No. That dream made me
change my mind.

23:28.567 --> 23:31.233
I want you to call my wife,
and tell her to put on
her best dress.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.433
-I'm taking her out to dinner.
-She'll be surprised.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.067
Then I want you to
call the florist and order
two dozen red roses.

23:36.133 --> 23:37.700
She'll be thrilled.

23:37.767 --> 23:40.333
And then call Chez Jacques
and have their
best champagne ready.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.667
-She's gonna faint.
-No, no, no. The champagne
ain't for my wife.

23:43.733 --> 23:45.833
It's for Hawkins.
And make sure they
put on the card,

23:45.900 --> 23:48.933
"Dear Brian, please join me
at my table and
we'll make a great deal."

23:49.000 --> 23:51.433
-You mean you're
gonna work tonight?
-Sure.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.333
-But didn't you learn
anything from your dream?
-Yep.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.233
I learned I'm gonna be a big
success and own 20 cleaning
stores. Now, get movin'!

24:30.533 --> 24:35.400
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:35.467 --> 24:37.733
* Movin', movin' on up
