WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
- IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM,

00:03.071 --> 00:06.240
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.077
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.110 --> 00:10.678
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.711 --> 00:12.346
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.380 --> 00:14.215
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.550
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:18.819 --> 00:22.690
[water running]

00:22.723 --> 00:24.325
- AH.
- AH!

00:24.358 --> 00:26.294
UH!
- OW! OW!

00:26.327 --> 00:27.161
UGH!

00:27.195 --> 00:29.797
COME ON, YOU CAN'T
GET AWAY FROM ME.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.466
- OH, NO!
OH.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.801
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT.

00:33.834 --> 00:37.105
[panting]

00:37.138 --> 00:38.339
AH.
- UGH.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.808
HA! YOU'RE DEAD.

00:40.841 --> 00:45.179
- DISARM, EVADE,
AND ESCAPE, BELLE.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.815
YOU'RE TRAINING
TO SURVIVE, NOT TO KILL.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.654
MM.

00:53.687 --> 00:58.259
- [loud scream]

00:58.292 --> 01:00.528
- OH, MY GOD, CATHERINE.

01:00.561 --> 01:04.332
- HE--HE WENT OUT
THE WINDOW.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.434
- I DON'T SEE ANYBODY.
- OLIVER, CALL THE POLICE

01:06.467 --> 01:07.868
AND TELL THEM TO MEET US
AT THE HOSPITAL.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.403
- NO HOSPITAL!

01:09.437 --> 01:11.505
BELLE, I CAN'T.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.707
[sobbing]

01:13.741 --> 01:15.443
- CAT, YOU NEED A DOCTOR.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.178
YOU WERE RAPED.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.114
- I DON'T WANNA BE HERE.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.749
- MS. HARRISON...

01:21.782 --> 01:24.785
I'M DETECTIVE STABLER,
MY PARTNER, DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.688
YOU FEEL UP TO TALKING?
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.557
- I'M SORRY, YOU ARE?
- ISABELLE.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.891
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.561
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:33.594 --> 01:36.330
- THERE'S NOT MUCH TO TELL.

01:36.364 --> 01:39.733
I WAS EXHAUSTED
AND WENT TO BED EARLY.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.270
- CAT TEACHES NINTH GRADE
AT JEFFERSON HIGH.

01:42.303 --> 01:46.407
- WHEN I WOKE UP,
HE WAS ALREADY ON TOP OF ME.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.576
HIS HAND OVER MY MOUTH.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.278
- HOW'D HE GET IN?
- THROUGH THE WINDOW.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.513
THERE'S A FIRE ESCAPE.
- I GUESS I DIDN'T LOCK IT.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.615
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.484
- CAT, DON'T YOU DARE
BLAME YOURSELF.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.618
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

01:57.651 --> 02:00.354
- NO. HE...

02:00.388 --> 02:02.590
RIPPED MY NIGHTGOWN
AND MY UNDERWEAR,

02:02.623 --> 02:05.626
PANTING IN MY EAR,
PAWING AT ME.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.895
- YOU SEE HIS FACE?
HIS BODY TYPE?

02:07.928 --> 02:10.564
HIS RACE?
- IT WAS TOO DARK.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.700
- IT WAS PROBABLY ONE
OF THOSE HOODLUMS FROM SCHOOL.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.236
- [sighs]
MY STUDENTS WOULDN'T ATTACK ME.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.504
THEY'RE GOOD KIDS.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.771
- GOOD AT ROBBING,
RAPING, AND RAISING HELL.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.473
- DON'T ACCUSE THEM,
THEY GET ENOUGH OF THAT

02:19.507 --> 02:20.874
FROM EVERYONE ELSE.
- WITH GOOD REASON.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.643
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF--
- ISABELLE,

02:22.676 --> 02:25.679
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE,
I'LL TAKE YOUR STATEMENT.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.690
- YOU KNOW
WHO ATTACKED YOU.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.428
- HE LIVES IN
THE APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.296
- WHO IS IT?

02:42.330 --> 02:45.333
- KEVIN.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.503
ISABELLE'S OLDER BROTHER.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.672
[crying]

02:54.742 --> 02:57.711
[dramatic music]

02:57.745 --> 03:03.817
*

03:41.655 --> 03:42.856
- ISABELLE, DID YOU SEE
OR HEAR ANYTHING

03:42.890 --> 03:45.859
DURING CATHERINE'S ATTACK?
- I WISH I HAD.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.897
AND MY BOYFRIEND, OLIVER,
IS TEACHING ME KRAV MAGA.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.732
I TRIED TO GET CAT
TO TAKE A CLASS,

03:51.765 --> 03:54.001
BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS TOO BUSY
TRYING TO SAVE THOSE HOOD RATS.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.003
- DID SHE EVER MENTION
ANY OF HER KIDS

03:56.036 --> 03:56.937
THREATENING HER?
- YES.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.539
THAT SCHOOL'S A ZOO.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.873
MOST OF THEM
ALREADY HAVE RECORDS.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.709
[phone rings]
GO THERE, YOU'LL SEE.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.544
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT WAS ISABELLE'S BROTHER

04:03.577 --> 04:04.945
WHO ATTACKED YOU?

04:04.978 --> 04:08.749
- KEVIN'S ALWAYS ON
THE FIRE ESCAPE, HANGING OUT.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.286
I'VE CAUGHT HIM WATCHING ME
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.253
- WAS HE OUT THERE
LAST NIGHT?

04:13.287 --> 04:17.758
- AROUND 7:30,
WHILE I WAS GRADING PAPERS.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.394
- AND YOU...

04:20.428 --> 04:21.829
OBVIOUSLY
DIDN'T TELL ISABELLE.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.332
- HOW COULD I?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.567
HE'S HER BROTHER.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.436
- IS YOUR FAMILY CLOSE
TO CATHERINE?

04:28.469 --> 04:30.037
- MY BROTHER KNOWS CAT.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.039
BUT HE BARELY TALKS TO HER.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.874
ANYONE REALLY.
KEVIN LIVES IN HIS OWN HEAD.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.076
- MENTALLY ILL?
- BIPOLAR.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.979
AGORAPHOBIC, TOO.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.014
WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
ASKING ME ABOUT KEVIN?

04:41.048 --> 04:43.083
HE DIDN'T ATTACK CAT.
- IT CROSSED YOUR MIND.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.585
THAT'S WHY YOU ACCUSED
HER STUDENTS.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.886
[door opening]

04:45.919 --> 04:47.688
- MR. HARRISON.
- WHERE IS SHE?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.724
- IN THERE.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.395
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
CATHERINE?

04:54.428 --> 04:56.464
- A LITTLE SHAKY,
BUT I'LL BE FINE.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.065
- OH, GOD.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.067
- I'M DETECTIVE STABLER.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.735
- OH.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.737
THANK YOU FOR CALLING,
DETECTIVE.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.073
I HAD NO IDEA
MY GRANDDAUGHTER

05:06.106 --> 05:07.641
WAS HURT
AND ALL ALONE.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.042
- I WASN'T ALONE.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.644
ISABELLE TOOK CARE OF ME.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.613
- YOU ARE COMING HOME
WITH ME.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.748
- NO, I'LL BE FINE
IN MY APARTMENT.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.949
- CATHERINE,
YOU REALLY SHOULD

05:15.983 --> 05:17.918
STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE
UNTIL WE MAKE AN ARREST.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.654
- YOU SEE?
YOU'LL BE SAFER WITH ME.

05:20.688 --> 05:24.492
- BELLE'S GONNA HATE ME NOW.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.927
- SHE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.096
I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
- [crying]

05:29.129 --> 05:30.998
- AW.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.966
- ISABELLE'S BROTHER,
KEVIN WRIGHT,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.968
PLED GUILTY
TO UNLAWFUL SURVEILLANCE,

05:35.002 --> 05:37.104
SECOND DEGREE,
IN MARCH 2008.

05:37.137 --> 05:41.141
HE WAS REGISTERED AS
A LEVEL TWO SEX OFFENDER.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.944
HE TOOK PHOTOS OF A WOMAN
UNDRESSING IN HER BEDROOM

05:43.977 --> 05:44.945
FROM THE ROOF
OF HIS BUILDING.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.147
THEN HE TRIED TO TELL
THE COPS HE WAS TAKING

05:47.180 --> 05:49.517
STILLS FOR HIS JOB
AT AN ENGINEERING FIRM.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.652
- WE GOT SEVERAL ARRESTS FOR
TRESPASSING ON THE SAME BLOCK.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.953
[phone ringing]
- HEY, GUYS...

05:52.986 --> 05:54.121
LIFTED TWO DOZEN PRINTS

05:54.154 --> 05:57.024
BELONGING TO KEVIN WRIGHT
FROM THE FIRE ESCAPE OUTSIDE

05:57.057 --> 05:58.859
THE VICTIM'S WINDOW.
- ANY PRINTS INSIDE?

05:58.892 --> 06:01.529
- NOPE. BUT THE LAB'S
STILL PROCESSING THE BEDDING.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.731
PRELIMINARY REPORT
SHOWS NO FLUIDS.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.966
- SO WE GOT NOTHING PUTTING HIM
IN CATHERINE'S BEDROOM.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.136
- WELL, WE DID RECOVER A PARTIAL
SHOE IMPRESSION BY THE BED.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.038
LOOKS LIKE
A MEN'S SIZE 11.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.106
- WELL, YOU GOT ENOUGH
DETAIL FOR A COMPARISON?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.475
- WHEN WE KNOW,
YOU'LL KNOW.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.843
- HUH.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.945
WELL, IF KEVIN WRIGHT
WEARS A SIZE 11, WE GOT HIM.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.913
- DON'T BOTHER
TRYING HIM AT HIS OFFICE.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.517
HE GOT FIRED TWO DAYS AGO
FOR ACTING CRAZY.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.018
- IT'S A GOOD THING
WE KNOW WHERE HE LIVES.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.956
- KEVIN SAID HE
DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH YOU.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.157
HE'S NEVER EVEN BEEN
TO YOUR ROOM.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.025
- BELLE, I'M SORRY,
BUT IT WAS HIM.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.193
- YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
SEE HIS FACE.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.862
- HEY, HEY, HEY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.965
- SHE'S ACCUSING MY BROTHER.
- I'M NOT MAKING IT UP.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.500
- CATHERINE,
YOU AND YOUR GRANDFATHER,

06:39.533 --> 06:40.934
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.
- COME ON, CATHERINE.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.703
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.
- AND NEITHER DO YOU.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.572
THEY'RE TRESPASSING.
ARREST THEM.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.839
- ENOUGH.
ENOUGH.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.040
SIR, IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.477
- I ALWAYS SAID
THIS WAS A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.912
- WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

06:51.945 --> 06:52.913
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.715
BUT HE'S DONE NOTHING
WRONG.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.617
- JUST ENOUGH
TO GET HIMSELF FIRED.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.752
- HE'S A BRILLIANT ENGINEER,
YOU KNOW.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.622
HE BUILDS BRIDGES.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.090
HE MUST'VE STOPPED
TAKING HIS MEDS.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.224
- HE DO THAT A LOT?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.627
- EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS,
HE THINKS HE DOESN'T NEED THEM.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.530
- AND WHEN HE DOESN'T
TAKE THEM?

07:09.563 --> 07:11.499
- HE GETS OUT OF CONTROL.
- WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY

07:11.532 --> 07:15.202
WHY YOU SHOULD
HELP US FIND HIM.

07:15.235 --> 07:18.972
- I HAVE HIS KEYS
IN MY APARTMENT.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.841
YOU'VE GOT THIS
ALL WRONG.

07:20.874 --> 07:21.975
KEVIN'S NEVER BEEN VIOLENT.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.644
- YOU HEARD CATHERINE SCREAM.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.712
SOMEBODY ATTACKED HER,

07:24.745 --> 07:26.580
AND YOU ACT LIKE
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.516
- THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
TO MAKE ME BELIEVE

07:28.549 --> 07:30.083
MY BROTHER'S GUILTY.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.085
- WELL, I GUESS
IF YOUR BEST FRIEND

07:32.119 --> 07:33.587
CAN'T CONVINCE YOU,
NO ONE CAN.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.823
LOOK, ISABELLE, A LOT OF--
- CAUGHT HIM, EL,

07:35.856 --> 07:37.124
HE'S GOING UP
THE FIRE ESCAPE.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.191
- MEET YOU UP THERE!

07:38.225 --> 07:39.693
- PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.966
- KEVIN!

07:45.999 --> 07:47.568
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
YOU OKAY?

07:47.601 --> 07:48.902
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.
GO AWAY.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.038
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU NEED TO COME INSIDE.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.806
- I CAN'T BREATHE IN THERE.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.709
- THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING YOUR MEDS.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.845
- AND THE WORLD
IS GLORIOUS.

07:57.878 --> 07:58.979
- WHOA, WHOA!
STOP!

07:59.012 --> 08:01.749
- LOOK AROUND.
LOOK.

08:01.782 --> 08:07.054
NO ONE APPRECIATES...
THE DETAIL

08:07.087 --> 08:09.122
AND THE CRAFTSMANSHIP...

08:09.156 --> 08:13.827
THAT GOES
INTO A STRUCTURE.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.129
ISN'T THAT GRAND?

08:16.163 --> 08:20.200
- I'M SORRY I DON'T
APPRECIATE IT THE WAY YOU DO.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.803
- I LIVE IN...

08:22.836 --> 08:25.272
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY

08:25.305 --> 08:29.076
IN THE WORLD.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.078
AND I HATE IT.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.681
- COME ON, KEVIN.
- GET OFF MY ROOF!

08:33.714 --> 08:34.848
- COME ON, MAN.
LISTEN,

08:34.882 --> 08:36.984
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING
ISN'T REAL.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.987
- [laughing]

08:40.020 --> 08:42.222
I HAVE CLEANSED MYSELF.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.692
AND NOW...

08:44.725 --> 08:46.259
I'M GONNA FLY.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.234
- [grunts]

08:54.267 --> 08:56.804
- A ONE-WAY
TRIP TO BELLEVUE.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.939
- BIG FEET THERE.
WHAT ARE YOU, SIZE 11?

08:58.972 --> 09:01.274
- KEVIN!
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO?

09:01.308 --> 09:04.311
- I HAD TO GET SOME AIR,
BELLES.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.549
I CAN'T BREATHE.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.827
- SORRY, DETECTIVES,

09:19.860 --> 09:21.028
YOU CAN'T TALK TO
MY PATIENT RIGHT NOW.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.596
- DR. WUNSTELL,
HE IS A RAPE SUSPECT.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.598
- AND AT THE MOMENT,
UNRESPONSIVE.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.999
- WHAT DID YOU
PUMP HIM FULL OF?

09:26.033 --> 09:28.068
- HALOPERIDOL
AND DIAZEPAM.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.037
- WELL, ANYTHING
HE SAYS UNDER THE INFLUENCE

09:30.070 --> 09:31.371
IS INADMISSIBLE.
- WOULD YOU PREFER

09:31.404 --> 09:33.140
KEVIN TRY
TO KILL HIMSELF AGAIN?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.008
- HOW LONG TILL
IT'S OUT OF HIS SYSTEM?

09:35.042 --> 09:37.978
- HE'LL STAY SEDATED UNTIL
I CAN EVALUATE HIS MENTAL STATE.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.714
HE'S SUICIDAL, ANXIOUS,
AND DEPRESSED.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.683
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY.

09:42.716 --> 09:46.219
- IT'S CALLED 25 TO LIFE.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.223
- NOT THIS GUY'S
FIRST VISIT TO CRAZY TOWN.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.860
- WELL, IT'S A LIFETIME
OF MEDICAL RECORDS.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.228
DIAGNOSED
CLINICALLY DEPRESSED AT 17,

09:55.262 --> 09:56.664
BIPOLAR AT 20.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.766
- THEY'RE ALL JUST AMMO
FOR HIS LAWYER.

09:58.799 --> 09:59.733
- [softly groans]

09:59.767 --> 10:02.402
- HARDWICKE'S IN MIAMI
AT A BAR CONFERENCE.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.672
ANYONE KNOW
WHO'S OUR TEMPORARY A.D.A.?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.240
- HOW ABOUT ONE
BACK FROM THE DEAD?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.409
- CASEY NOVAK.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.144
- ALIVE AND FAIRLY WELL.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.246
- GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, CASEY.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.715
- EXCEPT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE DISBARRED.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.883
- OH, CENSURED.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.417
LOST MY LICENSE
FOR THREE YEARS,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.853
BUT THE D.A.'S OFFICE
HIRED ME BACK.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.354
BUT I'M STILL ON PROBATION.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.422
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

10:22.455 --> 10:25.158
- A RAPE IN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS
THREE NIGHTS AGO.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.895
- THE VICTIM SAYS IT
WAS HER DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.163
- SO SHE SAW HIS FACE.
- NO.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.965
- SHE RECOGNIZED HIS VOICE?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.133
- PERP DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.703
BUT...SHE KNOWS THE GUY.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.871
- SO ALL WE HAVE IS
A SHAKY I.D. AND NO EVIDENCE.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.139
WELCOME HOME.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.708
- YEAH, WELL,
WE GOT FINGERPRINTS

10:40.741 --> 10:42.976
ON THE FIRE ESCAPE
LEADING INTO HER BEDROOM.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.311
- AND WE ALSO HAVE
A PARTIAL SHOE PRINT

10:44.344 --> 10:46.346
MATCHING
HIS SIZE 11 FEET.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.415
- SO WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT OUR SUSPECT?

10:48.448 --> 10:49.683
- KEVIN WRIGHT.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.118
HE WAS
INVOLUNTARILY COMMITTED

10:51.151 --> 10:53.286
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
BY THE COURT.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.755
HE DID TWO MONTHS
IN CREEDMOOR

10:54.788 --> 10:56.189
FOR SLICING
HIS OWN WRISTS.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.225
- AND A FEW DAYS AGO,
HE TRIED TO LEAP OFF

10:58.258 --> 11:00.193
A FIFTH STORY WALK-UP.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.796
THIS GUY JUST CANNOT
GET IT TOGETHER.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.231
- OR HE DOESN'T REALLY
WANNA DIE.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.100
- COURT-ORDERED THERAPY
AND HEAVY MEDICATION.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.837
THE GUY'S GOT
NIGHT TERRORS, MOOD SWINGS,

11:09.870 --> 11:11.338
AND CLINICAL DEPRESSION.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.941
- HE WAS
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.077
CREEDMOOR PSYCHIATRISTS
DIAGNOSED KEVIN

11:17.110 --> 11:18.478
WITH RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.781
- SO OUR PERP WAS ONCE
A VICTIM HIMSELF.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.884
- YEAH, EXCEPT HIS NAME

11:23.917 --> 11:25.452
IS NOT IN THE DATABASE
FOR THE ASSAULT.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.954
- BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.489
A LOT OF VICTIMS
DON'T REPORT, ESPECIALLY MEN.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.358
- YOU KNOW, IF IT DID HAPPEN,
YOU GOT MOTIVE.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.793
HOW MANY VICTIMS
BECOME PREDATORS?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.261
- PRISONS
ARE FULL OF THEM.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.297
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
FOR ONE MORE.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.434
- LOOK, KEVIN...

11:41.468 --> 11:43.737
WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF TRAUMA IN YOUR LIFE.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.873
ALL RIGHT?
WE KNOW YOU WERE ABUSED.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.810
- LOOK,
I DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY

11:49.843 --> 11:52.846
BECAUSE I HAD
A CRAPPY CHILDHOOD.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.817
EVERYONE
HAS A CRAZY UNCLE.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.418
I WAS LEFT ALONE WITH MINE.
BIG DEAL.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.519
- WELL, IT IS A BIG DEAL

11:59.552 --> 12:01.822
WHEN YOU RAPE SOMEBODY
IN YOUR APARTMENT BUILDING.

12:01.855 --> 12:05.225
- YOU KNOW, MOST
SEX OFFENDERS WERE MOLESTED.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.428
AND THERE'S A PAIN THAT
FESTERS AND TURNS INTO RAGE,

12:08.461 --> 12:10.230
AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YOU'RE PICKING OUT A VICTIM

12:10.263 --> 12:12.833
THAT YOU THINK
HAD IT COMING TO THEM.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.401
RIGHT, NOW IS THAT
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.870
- NO.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW CATHERINE.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.171
- SHE'S YOUR SISTER'S
BEST FRIEND,

12:18.205 --> 12:19.506
SHE LIVES RIGHT ABOVE YOU.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.308
TRY AGAIN.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.543
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE'S AFRAID OF ME.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.813
- AND THAT MAKES YOU MAD.
- I'M TELLING YOU,

12:25.846 --> 12:26.947
I COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT THAT GIRL.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.315
- SO WHAT
WERE YOUR FINGERPRINTS

12:28.348 --> 12:30.383
DOING ON THE FIRE ESCAPE
OUTSIDE HER BEDROOM?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.785
- 'CAUSE I GO UP
TO THE ROOF A LOT.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.286
- WHEN YOU'RE
NOT PEEKING IN WINDOWS.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.823
- NO, I GO UP THERE
TO LOOK AT BRIDGES.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.257
THEY'RE MY PASSION.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.326
I CAN SEE THEM
FROM UP ON THE ROOFTOP.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.028
- WELL, KEVIN, WE THINK YOU
WERE DOING A LITTLE MORE

12:41.061 --> 12:42.495
THAN JUST LOOKING AT BRIDGES.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.832
- [sighs]

12:44.865 --> 12:47.167
I KNOW WHAT CATHERINE
SAID ABOUT ME.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.169
BUT I NEVER
WENT INTO HER ROOM.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.871
- SO WHAT WAS YOUR
FOOTPRINT DOING IN HER ROOM?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.439
- IT WASN'T MINE!

12:52.472 --> 12:55.542
LOOK, I SWEAR, I HAVEN'T
SET FOOT IN THAT APARTMENT

12:55.575 --> 12:58.778
SINCE SHE MOVED IN
WITH MY SISTER.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.883
- HE WASN'T
LYING ABOUT BRIDGES.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.185
- I PULLED THESE PICS
OUT OF HIS DIGITAL CAMERA.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.519
- SO BRIDGE-GAZING
IS A HOBBY, HUH?

13:06.553 --> 13:10.190
- HE'S GOT THE GW, HIGH BRIDGE,
WARDS ISLAND BRIDGE.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.060
HIS FIXATION IS WEIRD,
BUT IT'S NOT CRIMINAL.

13:13.093 --> 13:16.063
- UNTIL HE AIMED HIS LENS
AT A LADY UNDRESSING.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.464
GOT POPPED
AS A SEX OFFENDER.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.899
- THAT'S IT?
IT LOOKS LIKE

13:18.932 --> 13:20.901
SHE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE IN THE PICTURE.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.869
- THESE PHOTOS CERTAINLY
PUT THAT ONE

13:21.902 --> 13:23.236
IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT.
- YEAH.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.839
KEVIN WRIGHT GOT SHAFTED,
HE NEEDED A BETTER LAWYER.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.175
- OR A LESS-AMBITIOUS
PROSECUTOR.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.277
'CAUSE I DO KNOW ONE
WHEN I SEE ONE.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.245
I ALSO KNOW A CASE
WHEN IT FALLS APART.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.513
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.849
- CATHERINE'S RAPE KIT
GAVE US DIDDLY--

13:35.883 --> 13:37.851
NO FOREIGN HAIRS,
TRACE, OR FLUIDS.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.220
AND C.S.U.
SAYS THE TRACE EVIDENCE

13:40.253 --> 13:41.188
ON THE PARTIAL SHOE PRINT

13:41.221 --> 13:43.590
COMES FROM A TYPE OF
CAFETERIA CLEANING AGENT

13:43.623 --> 13:45.558
SOLD ONLY TO NEW YORK CITY
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.928
- THE PERP IS
FROM CATHERINE'S SCHOOL.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.529
- ISABELLE
WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.598
- CUT KEVIN LOOSE.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.834
- AND I THINK
WE SHOULD TELL CATHERINE.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.507
- BUT I WAS SO SURE
IT WAS KEVIN.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.909
- WELL,
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID,

14:01.942 --> 14:03.911
IT WAS DARK
AND YOU WERE TERRIFIED.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.213
- ISABELLE WILL NEVER
FORGIVE ME NOW.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.416
HOW DO I FIX THIS?

14:09.449 --> 14:12.319
- I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.
- WELL, I HAVE TO TRY.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.588
I FALSELY ACCUSED HER BROTHER
OF ATTACKING ME.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.325
- ARE YOU SURE
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.327
I HEARD HE HAD
A SEX CRIMES RECORD.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.896
- AND WE DON'T BELIEVE
HE WAS GUILTY OF THAT EITHER.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.898
- I LOST MY BEST FRIEND
FOR NOTHING.

14:24.932 --> 14:28.902
- HONEY,
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.204
BUT A MAN RAPED YOU.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.605
YOU KNOW HE WAS BLACK,

14:32.639 --> 14:35.642
AND HE'S STILL OUT THERE.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.178
- CATHERINE,
CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH

14:38.211 --> 14:39.212
YOUR ATTACK ONE MORE TIME?

14:39.246 --> 14:41.614
- WHAT KIND OF PERSON
ARE YOU?

14:41.648 --> 14:42.482
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE HER

14:42.515 --> 14:44.151
RELIVE THIS WHOLE THING
ALL OVER AGAIN?

14:44.184 --> 14:47.220
- SIR, I'M TRYING
TO FIND HER ATTACKER.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.956
NOW, CATHERINE,
WE HAVE NEW EVIDENCE

14:48.989 --> 14:51.024
ABOUT ANOTHER MAN.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.061
THAT CONNECTS HIM TO
THE SCHOOL THAT YOU TEACH AT.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.398
ISABELLE SAID
THAT YOU WERE THREATENED?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.533
- I DON'T WANNA BE
WRONG AGAIN.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.702
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT?

15:02.735 --> 15:06.373
TRUST ME, ANYTHING
YOU SAY CAN ONLY HELP.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.983
- THERE'S A GUY.
HE'S NEW.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.685
AHEM. HE BRINGS IN
FRESH VEGGIES EVERYDAY.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.687
IT'S A HUGE DEAL
IN A LOW-INCOME SCHOOL.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.355
- AND YOU HAD CONTACT
WITH HIM?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.623
- IN THE PARKING LOT.

15:23.656 --> 15:27.460
HE...STARED AT ME,
FILLED WITH RAGE,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.296
MUTTERING "EFFING BITCH"
UNDER HIS BREATH.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.630
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?

15:30.663 --> 15:34.001
- DWIGHT TALCOTT.
AND I'M CLEAN, DETECTIVES.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.436
LIVING THE QUIET LIFE.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.670
- WELL,
THAT'D BE A FIRST.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.041
WE LOOKED YOU UP.
A LIFETIME OF CHARGES.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.243
POSSESSION, BURGLARY,
YOU NAME IT.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.345
- AND I'M PLACING YOU
UNDER ARREST.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.180
- FOR WHAT?

15:47.214 --> 15:50.083
- BURGLARY, ASSAULT, AND
THE RAPE OF CATHERINE HARRISON.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.418
- I DON'T KNOW HER.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.255
- YOU ALWAYS CALL STRANGERS
"EFFIN' BITCHES?"

15:55.288 --> 15:57.190
- [gasps]
DWIGHT!

15:57.224 --> 15:58.258
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:58.291 --> 15:59.726
- NOTHING, MA.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.628
LOOKS LIKE I WON'T
BE HOME FOR SUPPER, THOUGH.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.563
- YEAH, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
A HOME-COOKED MEAL

16:03.596 --> 16:05.698
ANYTIME IN YOUR FUTURE.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.634
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.602
- I TOLD YOU,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.271
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
NAMED CATHERINE HARRISON.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.672
- SURE YOU DO.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.142
YOU WERE CALLING HER NAMES IN
HER SCHOOL PARKING LOT.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.078
- THEN YOU STALKED HER,
THEN YOU RAPED HER.

16:18.111 --> 16:21.181
- LOOK, WE GOT EVIDENCE
PUTTING YOU IN HER ROOM.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.615
YOU WENT TO
AN AWFUL LOT OF TROUBLE

16:22.649 --> 16:25.152
CLIMBING UP
THAT FIRE ESCAPE,

16:25.185 --> 16:27.254
USING ALL YOUR BREAKING
AND ENTERING SKILLS

16:27.287 --> 16:29.022
TO GET IN THROUGH HER WINDOW.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.591
- GET OUT MY FACE.

16:31.624 --> 16:35.595
AND GET ME MY LAWYER.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.764
- HOW FAR DID YOU GET?
- NOWHERE.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.732
TALCOTT'S DOING LIFE
ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.101
THREE TO FIVE YEARS
AT A TIME.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.769
I MEAN, THERE'S
NO WAY HE'S CONFESSING.

16:42.802 --> 16:46.106
- LUCKY WE EVEN GOT
HIS NAME.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.044
- DWIGHT LOOKS CLEAN.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.245
- WHO ARE YOU?

16:52.279 --> 16:55.582
- JOE DEKKER,
DEPUTY D.A., LOS ANGELES.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.317
- WELL, SORRY,
WE FOUND HIM FIRST.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.387
- YOU'RE JURISDICTION'S
3,000 MILES HEADING WEST.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.589
- AND YOURS WAS PULLED OUT
FROM UNDERNEATH YOU.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.523
FROM WHAT I HEAR,

17:03.556 --> 17:06.226
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY
TO EVEN HAVE THIS JOB.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.295
- SMOOTH, YOU ALWAYS
OPEN WITH THE CHEAP SHOT?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.397
- WELL, IT WASN'T ME
LYING TO A JUDGE.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.099
NOW I WANT THE WARRANT

17:12.132 --> 17:14.467
AND EVERY LAST
BIT OF DISCOVERY YOU HAVE

17:14.501 --> 17:16.603
BY NO LATER THAN
CLOSE OF BUSINESS TODAY.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.638
- YOU'RE DEFENDING HIM?
- YES.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.540
- YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
TO BE LICENSED IN NEW YORK.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.575
- I AM.
DWIGHT IS FAMILY,

17:22.609 --> 17:24.144
AND HIS MOTHER LORNA
IS MY AUNT.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.678
- YOUR BOSS
KNOW YOU JUMPED SHIP?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.747
- UNLIKE YOU, I WENT THROUGH
THE PROPER CHANNELS.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.649
- NOW MY JOB HERE
IS TO ENSURE

17:29.682 --> 17:33.586
THAT THERE IS NO POLICE
OR PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.822
SO WE'LL BE SEEING
A LOT OF EACH OTHER.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.090
- GOODY, JUST WHAT WE
NEED AROUND HERE.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.191
ANOTHER ARROGANT PRICK.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.692
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,
DETECTIVE.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.729
CHECK MY CONVICTION RECORD,
AND YOU'LL SEE WHY.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.210
- THAT'S AN INTERESTING
TACTIC, COUNSELOR.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.146
I DON'T USUALLY SPEAK
WITH THE DEFENDANT'S MOTHER.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.613
- MS.TALCOTT
WAS WITH DWIGHT

18:00.647 --> 18:02.715
WHEN CATHERINE HARRISON
WAS ASSAULTED,

18:02.749 --> 18:04.717
PROVING HE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.620
- RIGHT.
MOMMY ALIBIING HER SON.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.522
I NEVER
HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.291
- MY SON IS NOT A RAPIST.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.825
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
MS. TALCOTT,

18:12.859 --> 18:14.494
YOUR OPINION OF HIM
MAY BE BIASED.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.563
- I KNOW DWIGHT
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.232
MY SON IS AN ADDICT.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.767
A THIEF.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.470
HE'S STOLEN MONEY FROM ME,
AND MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS,

18:23.503 --> 18:25.572
TO BUY DRUGS.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.873
I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE

18:26.906 --> 18:29.342
WATCHING DWIGHT
THROW HIS AWAY.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.278
BUT HE'S NOT A RAPIST.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.645
- THAT YOU KNOW OF.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.247
- NO, THAT WE'RE SURE OF.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.216
HE'S A REPEAT
MIDDLE-AGED BURGLAR

18:36.249 --> 18:37.617
WHO'S NEVER BEEN ACCUSED

18:37.650 --> 18:40.153
OF EVEN ONE
SEXUALLY-MOTIVATED CRIME.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.755
NOW EXPLAIN THAT.
- THAT'S NOT MY JOB.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.758
I ONLY HAVE TO PROVE HE DID IT,
NOT HIS REASONS WHY.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.194
- GOOD LUCK,
SINCE HE WASN'T

18:47.227 --> 18:49.762
ANYWHERE NEAR
THE VICTIM'S BEDROOM.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.198
- WHAT'S THIS?

18:51.231 --> 18:53.466
- PROOF THAT DWIGHT
WAS WITH ME

18:53.500 --> 18:57.604
AT THE 177TH STREET
COMMUNITY CENTER AND GARDEN.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.241
- THEY HAVE
A SECURITY CAMERA.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.642
- HE WAS WITH YOU
THE WHOLE TIME?

19:02.675 --> 19:05.645
- HELPING HER ORGANIZE
COMMUNITY WATCH ROTATIONS.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.514
- SOMETHING I'VE BEEN DOING
SINCE MY DAYS

19:07.547 --> 19:10.817
WITH THE STUDENT NON-VIOLENT
COORDINATING COMMITTEE.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.820
WE GOT THERE AT 6:00,
LEFT AT MIDNIGHT.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.856
- CALL ME WHEN
YOU'RE DISMISSING THE CHARGES.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.630
- SO THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO CLEAR DWIGHT?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.665
- WELL, IF CATHERINE
FINGERED THE WRONG GUY AGAIN,

19:25.698 --> 19:27.467
HER CREDIBILITY IS SHOT.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.302
- HE HARASSED HER IN
THE PARKING LOT,

19:29.336 --> 19:30.503
HE TRANSFERRED
TRACE EVIDENCE

19:30.537 --> 19:31.704
FROM THE CAFETERIA
TO HER BEDROOM.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.773
- IF IT WAS HIS SHOE.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.508
- SO GET US A WARRANT.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.610
- NO, I WILL.
BUT DWIGHT'S NOT STUPID.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.679
YOU'D HAVE BETTER LUCK
FINDING THAT SHOE IN THE HUDSON.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.481
- I'VE SEEN
YOU WIN CASES ON LESS.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.983
- THAT WAS BEFORE
MY REPUTATION TOOK A NOSEDIVE.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.518
- MY MONEY'S ON YOU.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.787
- MM.
SO FAR, ALL I'M SEEING

19:47.820 --> 19:50.523
IS A ROCK SOLID ALIBI.
DWIGHT'S IN PLAIN VIEW,

19:50.557 --> 19:52.559
EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES
WHEN HE HITS THE CAN.

19:52.592 --> 19:53.860
- FREEZE IT.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.928
HE JUST HEADED
OUT THE BACK DOOR.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.264
- HOW LONG
BEFORE HE COMES BACK?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.398
- HAVEN'T
GOTTEN THAT FAR YET.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.967
- OKAY,
SO HE LEAVES AT 8:20...

20:09.676 --> 20:11.511
DOESN'T GET BACK
UNTIL 9:13.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.480
- WELL, CATHERINE WAS
RAPED AT 8:45.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.348
THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME
TO GO TO HER PLACE

20:15.382 --> 20:17.550
AND GET BACK.
- LOOK AT HIM, HE'S A MESS.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.787
- MAMA NEVER KNEW
HE SLIPPED OUT.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.923
- BUT A JURY WILL.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.693
YOUR CLIENT DIDN'T
COME BACK FOR 53 MINUTES.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.728
- PROVING ONLY
THAT YOU CAN TELL TIME.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.698
MY CLIENT COULD'VE BEEN ANYWHERE
OUT OF VIEW OF THAT CAMERA.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.301
- LIKE MY VICTIM'S BEDROOM.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.703
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU PLEAD GUILTY,

20:36.736 --> 20:38.338
I'LL DROP THE RAPE CHARGE.

20:38.371 --> 20:42.442
BURG ONE, 20 TO LIFE.
IT'S A ONE-TIME OFFER.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.843
- POKER IS NOT YOUR GAME.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.513
- WE'LL SEE
WHAT A JURY HAS TO SAY.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.580
- NOT GUILTY,

20:47.614 --> 20:49.749
IF ALL YOU HAVE TO PRESENT
IS PAPER-THIN FORENSICS

20:49.782 --> 20:52.552
AND A VICTIM WHO CAN'T
TELL ONE BLACK MAN FROM ANOTHER.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.921
ASSUMING, OF COURSE,
IF NEW YORK EVEN REQUIRES

20:54.954 --> 20:56.889
EVIDENCE
TO CONVICT SOMEONE.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.925
- L.A. IS THE LAND OF
JUSTICE, REALLY?

20:58.958 --> 21:01.694
- MS. NOVAK...

21:01.728 --> 21:03.496
- I DIDN'T RAPE THAT GIRL.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.965
- WHO DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA BELIEVE, DWIGHT?

21:05.998 --> 21:07.467
AN INNOCENT SCHOOL TEACHER

21:07.500 --> 21:08.868
OR A CRACKED-OUT
MULTIPLE FELON?

21:11.804 --> 21:14.073
SEE YOU IN COURT.
- LOOKING FORWARD TO IT,

21:14.106 --> 21:17.310
SINCE YOU AND JUDGE PETROVSKY
ARE SO WELL-ACQUAINTED.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.824
- MS. HARRISON...

21:31.858 --> 21:33.960
CAN YOU PLEASE
TELL THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY

21:33.993 --> 21:35.962
WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU WENT TO SLEEP

21:35.995 --> 21:37.664
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION?

21:37.697 --> 21:38.965
- I WOKE UP

21:38.998 --> 21:42.935
WHEN I FELT SOMEONE
ON TOP OF ME.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.538
I THOUGHT BELLE
WAS PLAYING A JOKE.

21:45.572 --> 21:49.709
SHE ALWAYS MAKES FUN OF ME
BECAUSE I GO TO BED EARLY.

21:49.742 --> 21:53.846
[door opening]

21:53.880 --> 21:55.648
- AT WHAT POINT DID YOU
REALIZE

21:55.682 --> 21:57.484
THAT IT WASN'T A PRANK?

21:57.517 --> 22:02.389
WHEN MY RAPIST RIPPED UP
MY NIGHTGOWN AND MY UNDERWEAR.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.090
- AND DO YOU SEE THAT MAN
IN THE COURTROOM TODAY?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.892
- YES.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.126
OVER THERE.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.595
- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

22:08.628 --> 22:10.563
- I THOUGHT
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

22:10.597 --> 22:14.934
HE BANGED THE WALL
BEHIND MY HEAD A FEW TIMES,

22:14.967 --> 22:17.770
AND UNBUCKLED HIS PANTS.

22:17.804 --> 22:21.007
I WAS CRYING, SO...

22:21.040 --> 22:24.811
HE PUT HIS HAND
OVER MY MOUTH.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.013
AND THEN HE...

22:27.046 --> 22:29.549
HE...
- HE RAPED YOU?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.784
- OBJECTION, LEADING.
- SUSTAINED.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.487
- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT,
CATHERINE?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.589
- HE FORCED HIS PENIS
INTO ME.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.157
- DID HE HAVE A WEAPON?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.792
- I DIDN'T SEE ONE.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.394
- WHAT DID YOU SEE?

22:41.428 --> 22:43.129
- IT WAS DARK.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.565
I SAW THE OUTLINE
OF HIS BODY.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.866
- BUT YOU ARE
ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HIM?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.034
- YES.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.636
- WAS HE WEARING
PROTECTION?

22:49.669 --> 22:50.803
- GLOVES.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.640
AS FOR DOWN THERE,
I'M NOT SURE.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.542
I DIDN'T
SEE HIM PUT ANYTHING ON.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.109
- HOW LONG
DID THE ATTACK LAST?

22:57.143 --> 22:58.978
- IT FELT LIKE HOURS.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.613
- CAN YOU
ESTIMATE HOW LONG?

23:00.647 --> 23:02.982
- OBJECTION,
CAUSE FOR SPECULATION.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.552
- WITHDRAWN.

23:05.585 --> 23:10.457
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.593
- MS. HARRISON,
GOOD MORNING.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.963
NOW YOU SAID
IT WAS DARK IN THE ROOM

23:16.996 --> 23:18.731
WHEN YOU WOKE UP.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.868
- YET YOU RECOGNIZE
MY CLIENT AS YOUR ATTACKER?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.102
- YES.
- BUT IN FACT,

23:23.135 --> 23:25.905
YOU TOLD POLICE
THE MAN IN YOUR ROOM

23:25.938 --> 23:28.541
WAS...

23:28.575 --> 23:30.710
YOUR ROOMMATE'S BROTHER.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.778
KEVIN WRIGHT.

23:31.811 --> 23:32.912
IS THAT CORRECT?

23:32.945 --> 23:34.547
- AT FIRST.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.815
RIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT,

23:35.848 --> 23:39.418
I THOUGHT IT WAS KEVIN.
BUT I MADE A MISTAKE.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.756
- OTHER THAN RACE,

23:43.790 --> 23:47.660
HOW DID YOU DECIDE THAT
KEVIN WRIGHT WAS YOUR RAPIST?

23:47.694 --> 23:49.496
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.831
BOTH MEN HAVE SIMILAR
HEIGHT AND BUILD.

23:51.864 --> 23:52.999
- REALLY?

23:53.032 --> 23:55.568
YOUR HONOR, MR. WRIGHT
IS IN THE GALLERY.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.003
IF YOU COULD ASK HIM
TO STAND...

23:57.036 --> 23:59.205
- OBJECTION, KEVIN WRIGHT
ISN'T ON THE WITNESS LIST.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.107
- NO, I DON'T
WANT HIS TESTIMONY.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.042
HAVING BEEN
FALSELY ACCUSED OF RAPE,

24:03.075 --> 24:04.644
I THINK THE MAN'S
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.812
- OVERRULED.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.247
UH, MR. WRIGHT,
PLEASE RISE.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.650
- AND NOW IF MY CLIENT

24:10.683 --> 24:12.118
WOULD PLEASE STAND AND
FACE THE JURY

24:12.151 --> 24:16.022
FOR THE PURPOSE
OF THIS DEMONSTRATION.

24:16.055 --> 24:19.091
AS YOU CAN SEE,
MY CLIENT IS TWO DECADES OLDER

24:19.125 --> 24:20.927
HIS FEATURES
ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.029
HIS SKIN IS
SEVERAL SHADES DARKER

24:23.062 --> 24:24.531
THAN THAT
OF MR. WRIGHT'S--

24:24.564 --> 24:26.899
ANOTHER VICTIM
OF MISIDENTIFICATION.

24:26.933 --> 24:27.834
- OBJECTION!

24:27.867 --> 24:30.637
THE WITNESS CLEARLY STATED
SIMILAR BUILDS,

24:30.670 --> 24:32.605
NOT SKIN TONE OR AGE.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.006
- YOUR HONOR,
CATHERINE HARRISON

24:34.040 --> 24:36.242
WANTS US TO BELIEVE
THAT SHE ACTUALLY KNOWS

24:36.275 --> 24:37.944
THE MAN WHO ATTACKED HER.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.112
WHEN IN ALL REALITY,
THESE TWO MEN

24:40.146 --> 24:42.549
COULDN'T LOOK
MORE DIFFERENT IF THEY TRIED.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.750
- OVERRULED.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.385
SIT DOWN, MS. NOVAK.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.525
- THANK YOU.
NOW WHEN YOU FINALLY

24:52.559 --> 24:54.561
REALIZED THAT
YOU HAD MADE A MISTAKE,

24:54.594 --> 24:56.829
DID YOU CALL THE COPS
AND TELL THEM?

24:56.863 --> 24:58.798
- WELL...

24:58.831 --> 25:00.900
NO. THEY TOLD ME.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.635
- OH.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.904
SO YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT YOU HAD MADE A MISTAKE

25:04.937 --> 25:07.006
UNTIL THE POLICE
POINTED IT OUT.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.241
- YES, BUT--
- YOU'VE SEEN MY CLIENT

25:09.275 --> 25:11.744
BEFORE AT SCHOOL.
IN THE PARKING LOT.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.714
YOU CALLED HIM "THE VEGGIE GUY,"
IS THAT CORRECT?

25:14.747 --> 25:18.217
- YES, AND HE CALLED ME
AN "EFFING BITCH."

25:18.250 --> 25:20.319
- WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME
THAT YOU SAW HIM?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.254
- YES.
- WOULD IT SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW

25:22.288 --> 25:25.091
THAT MR. TALCOTT
DELIVERS VEGETABLES

25:25.124 --> 25:26.726
TO THE SCHOOL EVERY DAY?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.561
AND THAT WITNESSES
FROM YOUR SCHOOL

25:28.595 --> 25:30.597
WILL SWEAR THAT
YOU'VE PASSED BY HIM

25:30.630 --> 25:32.264
IN THE HALLWAY
MORE THAN ONCE.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.300
- YES, IT WOULD.
I'M PRETTY OBSERVANT.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.703
- SO OBSERVANT, IN FACT,
THAT AT FIRST,

25:36.736 --> 25:39.271
YOU PICKED KEVIN WRIGHT
AS YOUR RAPIST.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.974
NOW IT'S MY CLIENT,
TOMORROW IT'LL BE SOMEONE ELSE.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.042
PERHAPS EVEN ME,

25:43.075 --> 25:44.343
BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT BLACK MEN DO.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.012
WE RAPE WHITE WOMEN.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.914
- OBJECTION,
YOUR HONOR!

25:47.947 --> 25:49.015
- SUSTAINED.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.817
COUNSELOR.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.089
- MS. HARRISON...

25:57.123 --> 25:59.291
YOU'VE TESTIFIED
THAT IT WAS DARK

25:59.325 --> 26:02.595
THE NIGHT THAT YOU CLAIMED
THAT YOU WERE ATTACKED.

26:02.629 --> 26:06.065
NOW YOU'VE MADE ONE
FALSE ACCUSATION TO THE POLICE.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.366
AREN'T YOU, IN FACT,

26:07.399 --> 26:09.669
FALSELY ACCUSING MY CLIENT
TO SAVE FACE?

26:09.702 --> 26:12.338
- NO.
- HOW CAN YOU BE 100% CERTAIN

26:12.371 --> 26:14.841
WHEN YOU
COULDN'T EVEN SEE HIM?

26:14.874 --> 26:17.877
- HE WAS IN MY ROOM!

26:17.910 --> 26:19.846
HE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.614
I...

26:21.648 --> 26:23.983
I FELT HIS BREATH
IN MY FACE.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.918
I...

26:25.952 --> 26:29.622
I SAW HIS EYES,
HIS MOUTH.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.157
AND THEY BELONG TO HIM.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.725
- YOU BASTARD!
- COURT OFFICERS!

26:32.759 --> 26:35.628
- THAT ANIMAL OVER THERE
RAPED HER,

26:35.662 --> 26:37.229
AND NOW YOU'RE
RAPING HER ALL OVER AGAIN.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.865
YOU'RE RAPING HER ALL OVER--
[gavel thumps]

26:38.898 --> 26:40.266
- REMOVE THAT MAN FROM
MY COURTROOM.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.334
- THAT BOY OF YOURS
RAPED MY LITTLE GIRL.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.270
BUT SHE'S NO SLUT LIKE YOU.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.039
A DIRTY WHORE
WITH A PERVERT FOR A SON.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.407
A DIRTY WHORE!

26:48.440 --> 26:51.644
YOU WHORE! WHORE!

27:05.725 --> 27:07.326
- SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.962
- [sighs]
YOU ALWAYS DID KNOW

27:09.996 --> 27:11.964
WHERE TO FIND ME AFTER
A BAD DAY.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.233
- I'M AN EXPERT ON
BAD DAYS.

27:14.266 --> 27:18.871
HOW'S IT GOING?

27:18.905 --> 27:21.140
- I THOUGHT
IT'D BE EASIER COMING BACK.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.242
RIDING A BIKE, YOU KNOW.

27:23.275 --> 27:27.246
- WELL, GIVE YOURSELF
SOME TIME.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.115
- I DON'T RECOGNIZE
HALF THE FACES IN THE HALLWAY.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.718
- BUT THE JOB'S THE SAME,
YOU PUT BAD GUYS AWAY.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.085
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN GOOD AT THAT.

27:33.119 --> 27:36.022
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I HAVE IT ANYMORE.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.157
I MEAN, LOOK HOW QUICKLY
THIS CASE WENT SOUTH.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.126
- THEY ALL DO THAT
SOMEHOW.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.028
- BUT I'M SERIOUS,
ELLIOT.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.196
IF I LOSE THIS ONE
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,

27:44.230 --> 27:46.432
I'M DONE.
- OKAY, SO DON'T.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.434
DO SOMETHING.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.136
WORK HARDER.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.105
SAVE THIS FOR
THE VICTORY CELEBRATION.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.808
- IF PETROVSKY
DOESN'T CALL A MISTRIAL.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.209
- OKAY, SO YOU THINK
THE JURORS ARE POISONED.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.379
- DEKKER MADE CATHERINE
LOOK LIKE A GRADE-A RACIST,

28:00.412 --> 28:03.082
AND IT DIDN'T HELP
THAT GRANDPA JUMPED UP,

28:03.115 --> 28:04.851
AND HE WAS
YELLING AND SCREAMING.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.786
- WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WAS GRANDPA YELLING ABOUT?

28:06.819 --> 28:08.187
- WELL, FIRST,

28:08.220 --> 28:10.122
IT WAS THAT THEY'RE
RAILROADING CATHERINE.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.191
AND THEN...

28:12.224 --> 28:13.893
HE LIT INTO LORNA,
OF ALL PEOPLE.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.194
HE CALLED HER A SLUT.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.028
- THAT'S A LITTLE STRANGE

28:16.062 --> 28:19.231
TO BE GOING
AFTER DWIGHT'S MOTHER.

28:19.265 --> 28:23.502
- I SAW HER LOOKING AT HIM
WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.437
IT WAS LIKE
SHE'D SEEN A GHOST.

28:25.471 --> 28:28.440
- I'M GONNA RUN
A BACKGROUND CHECK ON GRANT.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.242
- YEAH, RUN LORNA TOO.

28:30.276 --> 28:33.145
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A CONNECTION.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.214
- OH, THERE'S
A CONNECTION, ALL RIGHT.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.084
GRANT HARRISON KNOWS
LORNA TALCOTT REAL WELL.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.920
HE AND HIS BUDDIES BEAT
THE LIVING HELL OUT OF HER,

28:40.953 --> 28:43.355
AND THEN SMASHED
HER FACE TO A PULP.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.792
RAPED HER REPEATEDLY, TOO.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.828
- 1964,
25-YEAR-OLD LORNA TALCOTT.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.162
WAVED DOWN A PATROL CAR,

28:50.196 --> 28:52.098
SAID SHE'D BEEN ATTACKED BY
THREE KLAN MEMBERS

28:52.131 --> 28:53.499
WHILE SHE WAS
GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR

28:53.532 --> 28:55.802
DURING HER
VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.169
- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
THE KLAN IN NEW YORK.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.771
- THEY'RE STILL HERE.

28:58.805 --> 29:01.107
REMEMBER THEY TRIED TO
MARCH THROUGH MANHATTAN IN '99?

29:01.140 --> 29:02.441
- SEXUAL ASSAULT
WAS A TACTIC THEY USED

29:02.474 --> 29:04.243
TO INTIMIDATE
CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.778
- YEAH, AND
JUST LIKE THOSE SCUM,

29:05.812 --> 29:07.513
GRANT AND HIS FRIENDS
WERE NEVER CHARGED.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.381
WHEN THE COPS FOUND THEM,

29:09.415 --> 29:11.350
THEY CLAIMED
LORNA WAS A PROSTITUTE.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.152
- YEAH, WELL,
LORNA WAS CHARGED WITH

29:13.185 --> 29:15.387
RESISTING AN ASSAULT,
BUT NOT PROSTITUTION.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.256
THE COPS BARELY EVEN
INVESTIGATED.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.925
- THERE'S PLENTY OF BIGOTS
IN UNIFORM.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.927
HELL, EVEN TODAY.
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.029
CATHERINE'S GRANDFATHER

29:23.062 --> 29:25.331
RAPES DWIGHT'S MOTHER
47 YEARS AGO.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.166
- SO WHAT, YOU THINK
DWIGHT FOUND OUT,

29:27.199 --> 29:28.801
AND WENT AFTER CATHERINE
TO MAKE THE OLD MAN SUFFER?

29:28.835 --> 29:30.269
- BUT HOW DO WE PROVE IT

29:30.302 --> 29:31.938
IF DWIGHT DOESN'T HAVE TO
TAKE THE STAND?

29:34.173 --> 29:36.175
- I'LL SUBPOENA LORNA.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.210
- CASEY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE SURVIVOR OF A GANG RAPE

29:38.244 --> 29:40.179
WHO NEVER GOT
THE JUSTICE SHE DESERVED.

29:40.212 --> 29:43.215
- AND WITHOUT HER TESTIMONY,
NEITHER WILL CATHERINE.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.120
- MY AUNT WAS RAPED?

29:48.154 --> 29:50.222
- BY MY VICTIM'S GRANDFATHER.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.391
HE AND
TWO OTHER WHITE MEN

29:52.424 --> 29:53.926
FORCED YOU INTO THEIR CAR.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.928
YOU WERE GONE FOR HOURS.

29:55.962 --> 30:00.266
THEY CLAIMED
THEY PAID YOU FOR SEX.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.869
BUT THE INJURIES
TO YOUR FACE AND BODY

30:02.902 --> 30:04.370
TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.943
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

30:10.977 --> 30:13.612
- IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU
TALK ABOUT AT FAMILY REUNIONS.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.214
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

30:15.247 --> 30:17.216
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
THE WHOLE STORY.

30:17.249 --> 30:20.119
I KNOW RELIVING IT
IS PAINFUL, BUT I--

30:20.152 --> 30:23.122
- YOU DON'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF THE WORD.

30:23.155 --> 30:27.026
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN LOOKED AT
AS SOMETHING LESS THAN HUMAN?

30:27.059 --> 30:30.129
BEEN DENIED SERVICE?
SPIT UPON?

30:30.162 --> 30:32.264
CURSED, BEATEN, OR RAPED?

30:32.298 --> 30:33.966
- MS. TALCOTT,
WE CAN DO THIS HERE

30:34.000 --> 30:36.969
AND YOUR SON CAN PLEAD OUT,

30:37.003 --> 30:40.006
OR YOU CAN
TESTIFY IN OPEN COURT.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.411
- THIS IS PRETTY LOW.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.881
EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO NEEDS
TO WIN AS BADLY AS YOU DO.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.149
- I'M TRYING
TO WIN FOR CATHERINE.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.318
- WHO'S GRANDFATHER
RAPED MY AUNT!

30:52.351 --> 30:55.154
- AND THIS VICTIM IS
JUST AS INNOCENT AS YOUR AUNT.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.156
SHE WAS TARGETED
BY DWIGHT AS REVENGE

30:57.189 --> 31:00.059
FOR THIS DECADES-OLD
ATROCITY.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.894
- AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE TAUGHT YOU,

31:01.928 --> 31:05.164
YOU'RE SCARED OF
A DAMN PIECE OF PAPER?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.632
- YOU DON'T GET IT.

31:06.665 --> 31:10.169
THIS PROSECUTOR IS
COMPELLING YOU

31:10.202 --> 31:13.305
TO DESCRIBE THE DETAILS
OF YOUR RAPE

31:13.339 --> 31:15.241
FOR THE RECORD.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.176
- NO ONE CAN MAKE ME
DO ANYTHING.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.345
- MS. TALCOTT,
IF YOU DON'T APPEAR,

31:19.378 --> 31:22.148
YOU'LL BE HELD IN CONTEMPT
AND TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

31:22.181 --> 31:25.151
- JAIL IS JUST
STEEL AND CONCRETE.

31:25.184 --> 31:28.154
I'VE SPENT PLENTY OF TIME
IN THE CELL.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.622
- WHAT DWIGHT
IS ACCUSED OF...

31:30.656 --> 31:33.559
IS TERRIBLE.

31:33.592 --> 31:36.095
BUT WHAT THAT OLD MAN DID
IS WORSE.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.278
- YOU LOST, COUNSELOR?
- NOT AT ALL.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.314
- THINK IT THROUGH.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.316
- LOOK, I JUST WANNA
TALK TO HIM.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.350
- I'D PROBABLY BUY THAT

31:58.384 --> 32:00.352
IF YOU DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE YOU WERE READY TO KILL.

32:00.386 --> 32:01.487
- WHAT,
YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME?

32:01.520 --> 32:03.455
- NOVAK TOLD ME
YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE NEWS

32:03.489 --> 32:05.257
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR AUNT VERY WELL.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.226
- NO, I'M GOOD.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.961
- I WOULDN'T BE.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.296
- YEAH,
WELL, I'M NOT YOU.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.730
- I TALKED
TO THE L.A. COPS,

32:11.763 --> 32:13.265
THEY SAID YOU
WERE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.434
THAT'S WHY YOU BEING HERE
IS A REAL MISTAKE.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.137
- HEY, THIS
ISN'T YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.306
GO BACK TO THE GHETTO,
WHERE YOU BELONG.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.608
I DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH
BOTTOM-FEEDERS.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.978
- I SUGGEST YOU
GO BACK INSIDE, OLD MAN.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.113
- AND WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

32:27.146 --> 32:28.747
- YOU KNOW WHO I AM,
GO TAKE YOUR NAP.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.483
- I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG, OFFICER.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.085
- YOU'RE JUST A RAPIST

32:33.119 --> 32:36.088
HIDING BEHIND
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.056
- YOU CAN'T RAPE
THE WILLING.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.091
- YOU GOT AWAY WITH
MULTIPLE COUNTS OF RAPE

32:39.125 --> 32:40.492
BY CALLING MY AUNT
A WHORE?

32:45.531 --> 32:47.766
- LISTEN, NOBODY WANTS
TO PUT YOUR AUNT ON THE STAND.

32:47.799 --> 32:51.003
BUT DWIGHT HAS TO PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID TO CATHERINE.

32:54.406 --> 32:58.477
- 25 TO LIFE IS
THE BEST I CAN OFFER.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.046
- SOUNDS LIKE
A REALLY GOOD DEAL

33:00.079 --> 33:01.180
FOR WHOEVER
RAPED THAT GIRL.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.381
- IF YOU
DIDN'T RAPE HER, DWIGHT,

33:02.414 --> 33:04.150
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN HER BEDROOM?

33:04.183 --> 33:06.218
- WE'RE COUSINS.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.020
THE WHOLE FAMILY LOOKS UP
TO YOU.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.255
NOW YOU SELL ME OUT?

33:09.288 --> 33:11.423
- DWIGHT, IF YOU
DON'T TAKE THE DEAL,

33:11.457 --> 33:14.193
YOUR MOTHER HAS TO
TAKE THE STAND.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.762
- YOU'D LET THEM
MAKE MY MOTHER...

33:16.795 --> 33:19.398
TELL A BUNCH OF STRANGERS
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER THAT NIGHT?

33:19.431 --> 33:22.134
- IT'S NOT UP TO HIM,
DWIGHT.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.703
ONLY YOU.
- LEAVE MY MOTHER ALONE.

33:24.736 --> 33:28.574
- I WILL IF YOU TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DID.

33:37.849 --> 33:41.053
- SOBRIETY'S NOT
ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.790
AS SOON AS I GOT CLEAN,

33:44.823 --> 33:48.360
I STARTED...REMEMBERING
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.162
THE MEN
TEARING AT HER CLOTHES,

33:50.196 --> 33:52.298
HER SCREAMS,
ALL THE BLOOD--

33:52.331 --> 33:54.733
- WAIT A MINUTE.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.034
YOU WERE THERE?

33:58.337 --> 34:00.139
- I TOLD MA I WANTED
TO GO WITH HER THAT DAY,

34:00.172 --> 34:02.274
I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN.

34:02.308 --> 34:07.246
KNOCK ON DOORS,
TALK TO PEOPLE.

34:07.279 --> 34:10.549
THEN A CAR PULLS UP.

34:10.582 --> 34:14.620
PULLS US BOTH INSIDE.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.389
SIX YEARS OLD...

34:17.423 --> 34:20.426
I GOT A GUN TO MY HEAD.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.466
THEY MAKE ME...WATCH...

34:30.636 --> 34:34.206
WHILE THEY...

34:34.240 --> 34:38.344
RAPED HER.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.646
SOMETIMES TWO AT ONCE.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.714
- AND AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

34:42.748 --> 34:44.883
YOU DECIDED TO FIND GRANT.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.619
WHY?

34:47.653 --> 34:49.755
- I STARTED
HAVING THESE NIGHTMARES,

34:49.788 --> 34:51.323
SEEING IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

34:51.357 --> 34:54.726
AND I KNEW THE ONLY WAY
I WAS GONNA STOP THE PAIN

34:54.760 --> 34:57.529
WAS TO FIND HER RAPIST.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.665
SO...

34:59.698 --> 35:02.901
I HIRED
A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.405
IT TURNED OUT GRANT
WAS THE ONLY ONE STILL ALIVE.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.408
I GOT HIS ADDRESS
FROM THE FILES.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.343
- BUT WHY RAPE CATHERINE?

35:11.377 --> 35:14.380
- 'CAUSE I WANTED GRANT
TO KNOW WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

35:15.514 --> 35:18.517
KNOWING HE COULDN'T
PROTECT SOMEBODY HE LOVED.

35:29.261 --> 35:33.665
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED...

35:33.699 --> 35:37.303
THE NIGHT YOU BROKE
INTO CATHERINE'S BEDROOM.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.305
- I MADE SURE SHE WAS ASLEEP,

35:39.338 --> 35:41.807
THEN I BROKE IN FROM
THE FIRE ESCAPE, WEARING GLOVES.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.675
- WHAT DID YOU INTEND TO DO

35:43.709 --> 35:45.877
ONCE YOU GOT INSIDE
THE VICTIM'S BEDROOM?

35:45.911 --> 35:46.878
- TEACH HER OLD MAN
A LESSON.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.815
I CLIMBED ON THE BED,
AND CATHERINE WOKE UP.

35:49.848 --> 35:53.252
I RIPPED HER CLOTHES.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.357
THEN, UM...
[clears throat]

35:58.390 --> 36:00.326
- INSTRUCT YOUR CLIENT

36:00.359 --> 36:02.894
WE NEED A FULL STATEMENT
FOR THE RECORD.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.931
- YOU'RE UNDER OATH,
DWIGHT.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.271
- TELL THE TRUTH, SON.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.947
- I DID NOT RAPE
CATHERINE HARRISON.

36:21.980 --> 36:26.352
- I THOUGHT THE DEFENDANT
AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY?

36:26.385 --> 36:28.620
- DID YOU RAPE
CATHERINE HARRISON?

36:28.654 --> 36:30.889
- NO.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.023
I KEPT SEEING GRANT
AND HIS FRIENDS

36:32.057 --> 36:34.960
HOLDING MY MOTHER'S LEGS WIDE
WHILE THEY RAPED HER.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.995
THEY LAUGHED
WHILE THEY BEAT HER,

36:37.028 --> 36:39.731
AND SHE SCREAMED.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.734
I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO DO THAT.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.336
IT'S NOT WHO I AM.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.775
- PERJURY VOIDS YOUR DEAL.
- I'M AWARE OF THAT.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.677
- DID YOU HAVE
FORCIBLE INTERCOURSE

36:51.710 --> 36:53.945
WITH THE VICTIM OR NOT?

36:53.979 --> 36:55.914
- NO, YOUR HONOR.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.884
SO GIVE ME MY SENTENCE
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.819
- BOTH OF YOU, BENCH,
NOW.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.260
- LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE TRYING TO RAILROAD

37:08.294 --> 37:10.296
ANOTHER DEFENDANT
INTO PRISON, MS. NOVAK.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.830
- YOUR HONOR,
BOTH DWIGHT TALCOTT

37:11.863 --> 37:13.732
AND HIS ATTORNEY
AGREED TO THE DEAL.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.033
- WHY WON'T
HE CONFESS TO RAPE?

37:15.066 --> 37:17.035
- MAYBE SOMEONE
CHANGED HIS MIND FOR HIM.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.770
- OR MAYBE
HE JUST DIDN'T DO IT.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.339
- THE VICTIM SAID HE DID.

37:20.372 --> 37:23.409
- YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT'S
ALREADY FACING LIFE

37:23.442 --> 37:25.677
FOR BURGLARY AND ASSAULT.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.480
I MEAN, WHY NOT CONFESS
TO RAPING CATHERINE

37:28.514 --> 37:29.948
UNLESS HE'S NOT GUILTY.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.351
- A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.985
I SUGGEST YOU FIND OUT

37:34.019 --> 37:36.722
BEFORE YOU WASTE
ANYMORE OF MY TIME.

37:46.665 --> 37:47.966
- IS IT TRUE?

37:47.999 --> 37:51.970
DID MY GRANDFATHER
RAPE DWIGHT TALCOTT'S MOTHER?

37:52.003 --> 37:54.473
- ALONG WITH
TWO OF HIS KLAN BUDDIES.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.908
- I HAD NO IDEA.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.010
HE LIED TO ME.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.882
- WHO LIED?

38:07.386 --> 38:10.922
- I-I CAN'T DO THIS,
I'M SORRY.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.392
- DID DWIGHT TALCOTT
RAPE YOU, CATHERINE?

38:13.425 --> 38:15.927
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.963
- WELL, TELL US AGAIN.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.631
DID DWIGHT TALCOTT
RAPE YOU?

38:19.665 --> 38:21.700
- OR DID
YOUR GRANDFATHER TELL YOU

38:21.733 --> 38:24.636
TO SAY THAT HE DID?

38:24.670 --> 38:26.805
- YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.074
I...LOVE PAPA.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.910
HE RAISED ME.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.946
- WHAT DID
GRANT TELL YOU TO DO?

38:36.548 --> 38:38.550
- HE TOLD ME...

38:38.584 --> 38:41.720
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME
IF I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS RAPE.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.823
HE SAID BLACK MEN RAPE.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.794
HE'S BEEN TELLING ME THAT
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.963
BUT I AM NOT LIKE HIM.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.031
I SWEAR THAT--

38:53.064 --> 38:55.934
I WORK AT THAT SCHOOL,

38:55.967 --> 38:57.035
I MOVED
TO WASHINGTON HEIGHTS.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.970
- TO PROVE TO YOURSELF
THAT YOU WERE NOT LIKE HIM.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.872
- YOU LIED UNDER OATH.

39:00.906 --> 39:04.743
OKAY, TO ME, TO THE JUDGE,
TO THE JURY.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.483
DO IT.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.485
- FACE THAT WAY, PUT
YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.822
- I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS
TO HAPPEN.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.690
[crying]
I...

39:18.724 --> 39:20.626
PAPA SAID I WAS CONFUSED.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.160
HE SAID TO SAY I WAS RAPED

39:22.193 --> 39:24.996
OR NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE
DWIGHT ATTACKED ME.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.732
- DEKKER...

39:26.765 --> 39:27.799
YEAH.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.668
- WAIT.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.869
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:30.902 --> 39:32.070
- YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER'S
GOING TO JAIL.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.705
- WHAT THE HELL FOR?

39:33.739 --> 39:35.974
- PERJURY.
YOU GAVE HER BAD ADVICE.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.643
HER ARRAIGNMENT'S TOMORROW,
YOU CAN SEE HER THEN.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.945
- DON'T WORRY, BABY.
I'LL GET THE BAIL TO GIVE--

39:39.978 --> 39:42.380
- ALL MY LIFE YOU HAVE
TAUGHT ME TO HATE.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.885
I HATE WHAT YOU SAY.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.421
I HATE WHAT YOU THINK.

39:49.455 --> 39:53.759
I HATE YOU.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.861
GO TO HELL.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.978
- MS. HARRISON...

40:14.913 --> 40:17.883
I'M SORRY.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.818
I'M REALLY SORRY.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.854
- I AM TOO.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.897
- 20 TO LIFE,
STILL ON THE TABLE.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.933
- MAKE IT 15,
AND YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.545
