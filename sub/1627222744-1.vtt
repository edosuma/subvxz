[Elle and Noah shouting]

00:18.500 --> 00:20.125
[Elle] Well, after graduation,

00:20.208 --> 00:24.541
Noah, Lee, Rachel and I decided
to take one week and go on a road trip,

00:24.625 --> 00:26.125
just the four of us.

00:26.208 --> 00:28.791
And while I was busy putting off
the inevitable decision

00:28.875 --> 00:31.791
between the two colleges
where I got accepted…

00:31.875 --> 00:33.166
[Lee] So, what about you?

00:33.250 --> 00:35.000
I-- I got wait-listed.

00:35.583 --> 00:37.666
Both Berkeley and Harvard.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.666
I was fully focused on making sure
we all had as much fun as possible.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.458
-[shouts]
-[Elle] And that's exactly what we did.

00:44.541 --> 00:46.458
Let me run you through the highlights.

00:46.541 --> 00:49.583
On our way up to Northern California,
we camped in the woods.

00:49.666 --> 00:51.708
-[Lee] Hey!
-[Elle] Went fishing on a lake.

00:51.791 --> 00:54.791
Fed some wildlife,
caught some waves at Big Sur.

00:54.875 --> 00:56.958
Watched Noah becoming friends with Rachel.

00:57.041 --> 00:59.541
Watched Lee watch Noah
becoming friends with Rachel.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.583
Watched a shooting star
with someone special.

01:01.666 --> 01:02.500
Oh, my God!

01:03.083 --> 01:06.000
Saw the fish at the aquarium in Monterey.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.666
Saw a sunset with colors
I had never seen before.

01:10.375 --> 01:13.250
And got a reminder
about rule number 19. [sighs]

01:13.333 --> 01:15.416
Decided to think about it later.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.083
-Drove to San Francisco.
-[bell ringing]

01:18.166 --> 01:19.583
Went to Fisherman's Wharf.

01:19.666 --> 01:22.083
-Ate clam chowder out of a bread bowl.
-[all chattering]

01:22.166 --> 01:24.375
-[Elle] Watched the sea lions on Pier 39.
-[animals bark]

01:24.458 --> 01:26.875
Watched our naughty video
from chemistry lab.

01:26.958 --> 01:29.166
[chuckles] Destroyed our naughty video
from chemistry lab.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.625
-Rode tandem bikes in Golden Gate Park.
-[laughing]

01:31.708 --> 01:33.208
[Elle] Rode a speedboat in the bay.

01:33.291 --> 01:34.958
-Caught a movie.
-[laughing]

01:35.041 --> 01:36.333
-Caught a concert.
-[cheering]

01:36.416 --> 01:39.375
[Elle] Even caught a baseball
in a kayak outside Oracle Park…

01:39.458 --> 01:40.541
Whoa, whoa!

01:40.625 --> 01:42.208
-[Lee] It's coming!
-I got it! [gasps]

-Oh, my God!

01:46.250 --> 01:47.875
Oh, my God!

01:47.958 --> 01:50.958
But the absolute best
was watching the Bay Lights

01:51.041 --> 01:53.708
with my favorite two guys in the world.

01:55.875 --> 01:58.125
But when you decide to escape reality,

01:58.208 --> 02:00.750
you know that eventually
you're gonna have to come back to it.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.666
So, when we got back home,

02:02.750 --> 02:05.666
I got a job so I could make some money
for college,

02:05.750 --> 02:07.541
whichever one I wind up going to.

02:07.625 --> 02:08.458
Oh, hey, guys…

02:08.541 --> 02:10.708
But as hard as that was for me to decide,

02:10.791 --> 02:13.458
a few days later,
things got even more complicated

02:13.541 --> 02:16.208
when Noah asked
a very unexpected question…

02:16.291 --> 02:17.125
Mmm!

02:17.208 --> 02:20.208
So, anyway, I was thinking, uh…

02:20.291 --> 02:22.583
when you get off the wait-list
for Harvard, maybe you and I

02:22.666 --> 02:26.625
could go off-campus
and get an apartment together.

02:27.625 --> 02:31.416
Wait. You mean, like…
like, get our own place?

02:32.583 --> 02:34.750
Yeah, look. [clears throat]

02:34.833 --> 02:37.958
I've been online all day.
There's some pretty cool places.

02:40.791 --> 02:41.750
What?

02:43.166 --> 02:45.458
-You wanna live with me?
-No.

02:45.541 --> 02:49.125
[laughs] Yes, of course I wanna live
with you. I wanna do everything with you.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.208
-Really?
-Yes, really.

02:51.291 --> 02:54.166
-How long do we have till Lee gets back?
-I don't know.

-See you.
-Where are you two going?

03:26.583 --> 03:30.458
Hmm. Noah wants to read me poetry
and tell me all about his feelings.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.708
I have painstakingly coordinated
my Berkeley schedule

03:41.791 --> 03:44.333
with your Rhode Island School of Design
schedule.

03:44.416 --> 03:46.208
-[Rachel] Aww.
-First up, we've got Labor Day.

03:46.291 --> 03:49.166
I know it's early in the semester,
but it's a long weekend,

03:49.250 --> 03:52.708
and I'm pretty damn sure
I'm gonna be having my Rachel withdrawals.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.166
That could work.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.083
Of course it'll work. We'll make it work.

03:57.166 --> 03:58.541
[Rachel] Okay.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.916
This place is so nice.
Thank you for bringing us here.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.541
Well, we wanted
to finally take you somewhere special

04:05.625 --> 04:07.500
to help celebrate your graduation.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.333
So, any big plans for the summer?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.250
Well, actually, now that you mention it,

04:12.333 --> 04:15.333
we were all talking about heading over
to the beach house this weekend,

04:15.416 --> 04:16.708
if that's cool.

04:20.416 --> 04:21.583
Is everything okay?

04:22.458 --> 04:25.583
Yeah, everything's fine.
Um, we just have some news for you.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.000
We are planning to sell the beach house.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.833
[all] What?!

04:30.916 --> 04:33.208
It doesn't make sense
to hold on to it anymore.

04:33.291 --> 04:35.541
Now that you kids
are going off to college.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.791
You know, the upkeep
on the place is hardly worth it

04:37.875 --> 04:39.500
since we're not even gonna be there.

04:40.083 --> 04:43.166
Truth is
the whole area is being redeveloped.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.083
You know what you sound like, Mom?
You sound like a realtor.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.041
That's because I am a realtor.

04:48.125 --> 04:51.625
Wait, so where are we gonna watch
the fireworks on the Fourth of July?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.250
No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.
You guys are not selling.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.625
I gotta go with Lee on this one.

04:55.708 --> 04:58.250
This house has been in our family
for, like, 80 years.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.416
You can't just get rid of it like that.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.541

05:03.125 --> 05:04.041

on your decision regarding Berkeley.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.875
Uh, yes. Hi.

05:26.958 --> 05:31.166
Um, is there any way
I could just get another small extension?

05:31.250 --> 05:32.958

05:33.041 --> 05:36.041
but we need your decision

from it any longer.

But don't worry,
I'm still good to babysit tomorrow.

Do you think you're gonna be working
a lot of weekends with this new job?

06:11.833 --> 06:13.875
Uh, yeah, looks that way.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.833
Uh, but I'm not working tomorrow night.

06:15.916 --> 06:17.208

-Yeah.

to give you a curfew, young man.

11:31.666 --> 11:33.625

dear parent of mine.

11:33.708 --> 11:36.500

at the beach house,

11:36.583 --> 11:37.708
and since, like you said,

11:37.791 --> 11:40.208
you're gonna need someone here,
help coordinating some stuff.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.583

we landed a beach house, right?

We can make this summer a blast.

I can't just
not be upset about this, Elle.

Okay, you're leaving me.

14:11.041 --> 14:14.166
[Elle] I felt horrible
about hiding all this from Lee.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.625
But the truth was I was leaving him,

14:17.708 --> 14:20.875
no matter how much I wanted
to be at Berkeley with him too.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.541

14:26.125 --> 14:27.833
All I wanted to do

14:28.583 --> 14:31.250
was show him how much he meant to me.

Lee,

14:38.041 --> 14:39.875
I don't know what's gonna happen.

14:39.958 --> 14:43.541
But what I do know
is that no matter where we are,

14:44.625 --> 14:46.375
you're always gonna be my best friend.

14:47.833 --> 14:51.166
And I just happen

14:51.250 --> 14:54.208
to be holding some list

14:54.291 --> 14:59.208
that says
we could make this our best summer yet.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.541

56:24.875 --> 56:27.166
She had an acceptance letter to Berkeley.

56:27.666 --> 56:29.750
Which means that she was never
on the wait-list.

she wants to be with you in Boston.

So, Mrs. Flynn,
I believe you'll find the paperwork

1:33:52.125 --> 1:33:54.250
for the sale of the properties in order.

1:33:54.333 --> 1:33:57.708
We only need this last signature
to finalize the deal.

1:34:00.791 --> 1:34:03.833
[Elle] And I can't begin to say
how thankful I am for it.

1:34:04.500 --> 1:34:07.875
Instead, I'm enclosing a small gift

1:34:08.583 --> 1:34:10.875
and sending it with all my love.

1:34:11.500 --> 1:34:12.333
Elle.

1:34:17.208 --> 1:34:18.750
[man] Is there a problem?

1:34:18.833 --> 1:34:20.166
Mrs. Flynn?

1:34:22.791 --> 1:34:23.625
No.

1:34:24.208 --> 1:34:25.708
No problem at all.

1:34:25.791 --> 1:34:28.250
[sighs] I'm just not selling this house.

1:34:28.333 --> 1:34:30.958

-That one's so-- the light is perfect.
-You think? I mean, I don't know.

1:35:00.958 --> 1:35:02.875
-I'll see you later, okay?
-Yeah, cool.

1:35:02.958 --> 1:35:04.500
Do you think that maybe I should…

1:35:12.708 --> 1:35:14.583
So you're going to USC?

1:35:15.791 --> 1:35:18.083
Uh, I--

1:35:18.166 --> 1:35:21.333
Yeah, I have an interview
for their spring term next week.

1:35:23.041 --> 1:35:25.750
It's a really competitive program,
so I probably won't even get in.

1:35:25.833 --> 1:35:27.166
Are you kidding me?

1:35:28.916 --> 1:35:30.750

that things didn't work out between us.

1:36:07.375 --> 1:36:08.833
[Noah] Don't forget me, okay?

1:36:19.833 --> 1:36:20.958
Goodbye, Noah.

[Lee] Elle,
take care of our game while I'm away.

1:36:45.166 --> 1:36:46.416
Until our next dance.

1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.125
Your best friend, Lee.

1:36:51.458 --> 1:36:54.083
[Elle] Yeah. Classic Lee.

1:36:56.250 --> 1:36:59.666
One of the things that we do here,
at the video games department

1:36:59.750 --> 1:37:03.500
is we pitch and develop our own ideas
into finished products.

1:37:04.166 --> 1:37:06.958
We were hoping
that you might pitch any ideas you have

1:37:07.041 --> 1:37:09.958
for possible games or gaming products.

1:37:10.583 --> 1:37:13.833
Yeah, of course, totally, definitely.

1:37:16.291 --> 1:37:18.541
Oh, you mean, like, right now?

1:37:19.166 --> 1:37:22.583
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that
I was supposed to prepare that for today.

1:37:23.166 --> 1:37:26.875
It doesn't have to be anything formal.
Just a sharing of concepts.

1:37:26.958 --> 1:37:28.916
Right, of course. Um…

1:37:30.125 --> 1:37:32.083
[sighs] Um…

1:37:32.666 --> 1:37:33.625

1:37:33.708 --> 1:37:36.375
Oh, my God. Um, I'm so sorry. There's--

1:37:36.458 --> 1:37:40.208
Nothing's coming to my mind.
I just-- I don't know what to say.

1:37:40.291 --> 1:37:42.166
Look, it's not a problem, Elle.

1:37:42.250 --> 1:37:45.625
Uh, actually,
I-- I think we have everything we need.

1:37:46.250 --> 1:37:48.333
-Thank you.
-[man 2] Thank you.

1:37:48.916 --> 1:37:50.041
Yeah, thank you.

1:37:58.125 --> 1:37:59.333
I-- I did have one idea.

1:38:00.250 --> 1:38:03.208
But it's-- I mean,
it's really just more of a basic concept.

1:38:04.916 --> 1:38:05.916
Go ahead, Elle.

1:38:07.875 --> 1:38:08.708
Um…

1:38:12.250 --> 1:38:17.000
You know how in fantasy sports,
people draft real-world sports athletes,

1:38:17.083 --> 1:38:20.541
and the players' performances are used
to determine the success of--

1:38:20.625 --> 1:38:23.833
I think we're all aware
of how fantasy football works, Miss Evans.

1:38:23.916 --> 1:38:25.291
[chuckles] Cool, yeah, sorry.

1:38:25.375 --> 1:38:27.041
Um, of course. [clears throat]

1:38:27.958 --> 1:38:31.791
What if we were to apply that
to a large e-sports platform?

1:38:32.375 --> 1:38:34.541
Players could get together
at the beginning of the season

1:38:34.625 --> 1:38:38.583
and take turns drafting
their favorite pro players.

1:38:38.666 --> 1:38:41.083
And you could even call it
"Fantas-E Sports."

1:38:41.166 --> 1:38:45.416
And fantasy football's, like,
a multimillion-dollar industry, right?

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.166
It's $7 billion actually.

1:38:49.750 --> 1:38:51.458
See? There you go.

1:38:51.541 --> 1:38:54.791
And how much
is the e-sports industry raking in?

1:38:54.875 --> 1:38:57.375
Uh, two billion.

1:38:58.125 --> 1:39:01.500
So, I mean, it kind of seems
like that might be worth something.

1:39:04.875 --> 1:39:06.708
Oh, and I also have this other idea…

Lee and I stayed connected

Lee moved back to Los Angeles.
