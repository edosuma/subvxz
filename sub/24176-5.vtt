00:32.601 --> 00:34.201
Luca...

00:35.841 --> 00:37.521
Luca...

00:40.841 --> 00:42.241
Luca...

00:43.641 --> 00:46.121
- Hi!
- Hey...

00:50.881 --> 00:52.281
I'm glad it's over.

00:52.441 --> 00:55.041
- Hi, Francesca.
- Hi.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.401
You'll have a scar...

01:01.401 --> 01:03.321
but it'll be sexy.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.641
What are you doing?

01:17.441 --> 01:20.881
Well, I think your vital functions
are intact.

01:24.521 --> 01:28.281
So, how's the blood?
Is it good?

01:33.161 --> 01:34.641
No!

01:35.081 --> 01:36.801
Luca!

01:51.081 --> 01:55.281
Whenever I have any money,
I blow it all.

01:55.721 --> 01:58.241
Poker, horse-racing, gambling...

01:58.881 --> 02:00.801
I owe half of Milan money.

02:00.961 --> 02:05.481
To people who'd still break my arm
even though I'm a cop.

02:05.641 --> 02:08.241
- Why are you telling me this?
- I brought you here.

02:08.881 --> 02:11.681
I found you unconscious
on the floor. Then...

02:13.681 --> 02:15.681
Then they told me that...

02:18.681 --> 02:22.441
I found out your secret.
Now you know mine too.

02:23.361 --> 02:25.881
We're even, right?

02:27.081 --> 02:28.681
You can trust me.

02:30.081 --> 02:32.841
I'll tell you why I've got it in
for Mainaghi then.

03:13.041 --> 03:16.001
JUNE 22nd

03:16.081 --> 03:17.361
That's 15,000 liras.

03:18.761 --> 03:20.481
No, I'll get it...

03:21.321 --> 03:22.881
I'll get it.

03:25.081 --> 03:26.881
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

03:33.841 --> 03:35.801
SantÃ©.

03:40.121 --> 03:43.361
Ever since Salvatores won an Oscar
everyone wants him.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.641
I sent him a screenplay.

03:45.801 --> 03:49.401
Guess who he has
the perfect role for?

03:50.601 --> 03:52.761
- What role is it?
- Anna.

03:52.921 --> 03:57.681
A woman who's suffered, fought
and overcome difficulties in life.

03:57.761 --> 03:59.041
A wonderful role.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.561
But let's wait for him to read it

04:02.321 --> 04:04.401
and see what he says first.

04:04.561 --> 04:07.121
I reckon he'll like it.

04:08.441 --> 04:10.881
With me you'll become a star.

04:11.521 --> 04:15.881
With this meeting, the 4th Defense
Committee of the Chamber of Deputies

04:16.081 --> 04:21.481
declares Honorable Savio Gastone,
from the CD party, president.

04:21.641 --> 04:24.241
The post of vice-president goes to

04:24.401 --> 04:28.761
Isaia Gasparotto from
the Democratic Party of the Left

04:28.921 --> 04:33.041
and to Antonio Pappalardo from
the Democratic Socialist Party.

04:37.761 --> 04:41.281
- I'm going. Bye.
- See you.

04:41.641 --> 04:43.681
- Bye, Pietro.
- Bye.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.961
Bosco!

04:54.281 --> 04:57.321
Lorenzon! How come you're here?

05:01.041 --> 05:02.881
What's with the faggot juice?

05:04.401 --> 05:07.401
In the desert our breakfast
was Chivas Regal and coke.

05:07.561 --> 05:10.761
- "The breakfast of champions."
- The breakfast of losers.

05:11.961 --> 05:15.201
- Why were you outside Parliament?
- Why were you inside?

05:15.361 --> 05:20.041
- I've been elected.
- I know, that's why I came.

05:21.561 --> 05:23.321
Why?

05:25.321 --> 05:27.201
I'm ill, Pietro.

05:28.241 --> 05:31.241
I've got cancer, of the blood.

05:31.401 --> 05:33.601
What the hell are you saying?

05:33.761 --> 05:36.361
It's not just me, though.
There's lots of us.

05:37.521 --> 05:39.201
Marines, foot soldiers...

05:39.361 --> 05:42.601
American and English soldiers too,
people from everywhere.

05:42.761 --> 05:45.161
It can't be a coincidence, right?

05:45.321 --> 05:48.961
Who knows what goddamn ammunition
our men were using there.

05:49.641 --> 05:53.721
Phosphorus, depleted uranium,
it could've been anything.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.601
How do you know this stuff?

05:57.761 --> 06:00.801
I don't. That's the problem.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.841
I want the truth.

06:05.521 --> 06:07.081
What did the doctors say?

06:07.241 --> 06:11.681
That if I get treatment,
I'll live for a few more years.

06:12.961 --> 06:15.201
But my family needs money

06:15.361 --> 06:17.881
and the State won't give me
compensation.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.641
Only the goddamn radar men get that.

06:20.801 --> 06:24.881
Like radars are the only
carcinogenic things used in wars.

06:26.321 --> 06:29.801
All right, I'll raise this issue
with the Defense Committee.

06:31.721 --> 06:34.401
I'll kick up a massive goddamn stink.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.801
I'll help you, you got that?

06:51.361 --> 06:52.761
<i>My dear brilliant Leonardo!</i>

06:52.921 --> 06:56.201
<i>I heard you're back in the field,
why don'tyou come back to us?</i>

06:56.361 --> 07:00.281
<i>We've got a tricky client,
we need a pro.</i>

07:00.441 --> 07:02.881
<i>Come on, give me a call. Bye.</i>

07:50.961 --> 07:53.681
You just can't leave me alone,
can you?

07:55.201 --> 07:57.681
I need an answer, Bibi.

07:59.641 --> 08:03.361
"Astronaut".
How's that for an answer?

08:03.761 --> 08:06.481
Great, keep it up...

08:07.241 --> 08:11.041
The company's at a standstill,
what should I tell the workers?

08:11.121 --> 08:15.201
That a spoilt brat
can't make up her mind?

08:15.641 --> 08:16.601
Impressive...

08:23.841 --> 08:25.441
Bibi...

08:26.361 --> 08:29.201
You let your father down
when he was alive,

08:29.321 --> 08:32.281
try not to do it now that he's dead.

08:42.721 --> 08:43.681
JUNE 26th

08:43.761 --> 08:46.321
<i>I called in sick,
it was a sunny summer day.</i>

08:46.441 --> 08:49.721
<i>I went to pick Francesca up
from the jeweler's where she worked.</i>

08:49.881 --> 08:53.561
<i>I went in, I started
joking around with her.</i>

08:53.721 --> 08:57.641
<i>I pretended I was a customer
who wanted a ring for his girlfriend.</i>

08:58.681 --> 09:01.641
<i>Then that guy pulled out a gun
and in an instant</i>

09:02.521 --> 09:05.121
<i>I ended up getting shot.</i>

09:05.281 --> 09:09.441
<i>I lost so much blood
I needed a transfusion.</i>

09:09.641 --> 09:12.761
<i>"It's a miracle you're alive",
they said to me.</i>

09:14.601 --> 09:16.081
<i>Alive.</i>

09:16.241 --> 09:18.801
Illnesses can teach us
who we are, right?

09:19.321 --> 09:22.081
Are you a New Age fan too?

09:38.321 --> 09:41.761
A bad case of pneumonia.
It's my duty to tell you.

09:44.321 --> 09:46.841
And you need to be prepared
for the worst.

09:46.921 --> 09:48.441
But that doesn't mean that...

09:48.561 --> 09:52.081
It may not be full-blown AIDS,
we have to see.

09:53.241 --> 09:56.561
In your case
a cold could be enough.

10:03.201 --> 10:07.521
You can go now, they'll call you
when the results are in.

10:15.641 --> 10:19.321
Do you realize what they said to me
the other day?

10:19.961 --> 10:22.001
I'll call you later...

10:22.841 --> 10:24.601
- Yes.
- Thank you.

10:24.761 --> 10:26.281
Bye.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.921
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:40.601 --> 10:43.241
- Lunch break in the park?
- Yes.

10:44.281 --> 10:47.121
Old habits die hard.

10:49.841 --> 10:52.161
But I see you have news.

10:52.321 --> 10:55.561
I'm sorry that you found out
like this.

11:00.041 --> 11:03.121
- How are you?
- I'm great.

11:07.881 --> 11:10.521
Don't look at me like that,
Francesca.

11:12.321 --> 11:15.281
This is what you wanted.
It's why you left me.

11:17.641 --> 11:19.321
Sorry.

11:19.521 --> 11:21.801
I'm happy for you.

11:23.601 --> 11:27.721
I read about Mainaghi,
I wanted to call you.

11:27.881 --> 11:31.201
- You must be glad.
- Yes, I can die in peace now.

11:31.881 --> 11:34.281
I left you because
you've become like this.

11:34.401 --> 11:37.081
Bullshit, you left me
because of my illness.

11:40.641 --> 11:43.281
I came to say goodbye to you.

11:48.681 --> 11:50.201
Don't touch me.

11:53.801 --> 11:56.001
It's time for businessmen
to show their faces.

11:56.641 --> 12:00.241
People have to identify with them
and their achievements.

12:00.361 --> 12:03.681
A successful man emanates
confidence and hope.

12:03.841 --> 12:05.921
People have to buy Giovanni Rana.

12:06.081 --> 12:08.761
That's what I say,
but they think I'm crazy.

12:08.921 --> 12:13.961
The agencies always propose
the same grandma in the kitchen idea.

12:14.121 --> 12:17.841
That's why I called you.
We have to be innovative.

12:18.121 --> 12:19.881
You did the right thing.

12:20.641 --> 12:25.041
These are some actors
who can impersonate you in the ads.

12:25.241 --> 12:28.161
All paternal-looking,
reassuring faces.

12:31.321 --> 12:34.041
Why use actors? I'll do it!

12:34.121 --> 12:36.801
I make the tortellini, it's my story.

12:36.961 --> 12:40.041
Look, trust us, think about
Moretti's moustached man.

12:40.121 --> 12:43.321
Mr Moretti went to a restaurant,
saw a moustached man

12:43.361 --> 12:45.681
and thought
he should represent his beer.

12:45.801 --> 12:48.321
He took his photo
and the rest is history.

12:48.361 --> 12:52.281
Come on, this is my life,
I make these tortellini.

12:53.881 --> 12:57.321
- It's my passion.
- Would you really do it?

12:57.921 --> 13:02.321
Young man, I started selling tortellini
when I was this tall.

13:02.721 --> 13:05.801
I sold pasta and tortellini
door-to-door,

13:05.961 --> 13:08.921
and I made many sacrifices.

13:09.081 --> 13:12.561
So I'm certainly not afraid
of a video camera!

13:13.161 --> 13:16.041
I bet that once you see our actors
you'll agree with us.

13:16.161 --> 13:19.201
No, no, no. He's right.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.601
The consumer's buying
into his smile, his voice.

13:24.761 --> 13:26.561
They'll trust the product

13:26.641 --> 13:30.361
and develop a sentimental
relationship with it,

13:30.601 --> 13:32.401
which'll last through time.

13:32.801 --> 13:35.961
Thank goodness, you've understood,
good on you!

13:41.961 --> 13:44.681
Oh, Leo. Why the long face?

13:44.841 --> 13:48.001
Rana was happy,
it went really well.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.161
I saw Mignani the other night.
He thinks he's hot shit.

13:51.321 --> 13:55.321
- He came up with a great slogan.
- I know, but...

13:55.801 --> 13:57.561
I'll do the same.

14:13.761 --> 14:15.081
Let go of me!

14:18.201 --> 14:20.521
Let go of me!

14:20.921 --> 14:23.641
- Let go of me!
- Cut it out! She's a girl!

14:24.201 --> 14:26.321
What the hell do you want?

14:28.841 --> 14:30.721
- What the hell...
- Asshole!

14:30.881 --> 14:34.601
- Get the hell out of here!
- I know the owner!

14:35.601 --> 14:38.041
Fat bastard.

14:44.041 --> 14:46.041
You're Zeno's sister.

14:46.961 --> 14:48.321
Yes.

14:48.441 --> 14:50.921
I'm Leonardo.
I know your brother.

14:51.681 --> 14:53.321
You know everyone...

15:00.161 --> 15:01.401
Why was he so mad?

15:02.041 --> 15:05.121
I dunno, it was five minutes ago,
how would I remember?

15:05.841 --> 15:08.361
Take me somewhere.

15:10.161 --> 15:14.081
- How old are you?
- What do you care?

15:19.041 --> 15:23.201
My father always wanted me to have fun
and have a stress-free life.

15:23.601 --> 15:26.161
Then I found out
he left everything to me.

15:27.321 --> 15:30.681
I mean, do you realize?
Me, president...

15:32.801 --> 15:35.321
I think you should accept
the position.

15:36.361 --> 15:38.921
Even just to piss Zeno off.

15:39.081 --> 15:41.281
I don't know how to do anything...

16:00.881 --> 16:04.321
Bibi, Bibi... Hey, Bibi...

16:08.761 --> 16:11.441
Bibi... Bibi!

16:21.881 --> 16:23.561
Bibi, hey...

16:25.961 --> 16:27.521
No, holy shit.

16:37.321 --> 16:39.201
- Give me some Narcan.
- You need a prescription.

16:39.321 --> 16:42.801
Shit, give me some Narcan!
Come on, hurry up...

16:43.561 --> 16:46.281
The syringes, goddamit! Please!

17:03.841 --> 17:05.441
Fuck!

17:11.841 --> 17:16.001
Hey, please, no, no...

17:18.961 --> 17:21.561
Open your eyes,
you'll be all right, okay?

17:22.121 --> 17:24.201
You're going to be all right!

18:27.121 --> 18:30.361
Sergio, I'm going to sleep,
I'm a bit tired.

18:30.561 --> 18:34.641
Tired? But you're so young!
We have to celebrate!

18:35.081 --> 18:36.081
Celebrate what?

18:36.161 --> 18:39.441
Salvatores read the screenplay
and he loved it!

18:39.641 --> 18:41.201
- Really?
- Yes.

18:43.601 --> 18:45.681
"The Heart of the Night".

18:46.161 --> 18:49.321
Ready to do a film
win an Oscar-winning director?

18:53.281 --> 18:56.121
What do you say
to your dear Sergio?

18:57.321 --> 18:59.921
- Thank you.
- I want more than that.

19:00.081 --> 19:01.241
Come on.

19:26.401 --> 19:29.201
Tell me you're my bitch.

19:29.321 --> 19:32.121
- I'm your bitch.
- Louder!

19:35.161 --> 19:37.401
- I'm your bitch.
- Again!

19:40.121 --> 19:42.521
I'm your bitch.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.241
Thank you.

19:51.961 --> 19:54.081
Will you stay a while?

19:55.281 --> 19:57.881
Sorry, I'm not a junkie.

19:58.041 --> 20:00.761
I have the occasional line, to relax.

20:05.961 --> 20:09.601
Is your father's business
stressing you out?

20:13.081 --> 20:17.721
I think you've already decided.
You just need to get used to the idea.

20:24.321 --> 20:27.561
How can you change your life
from one day to the next?

20:29.241 --> 20:31.041
You can.

20:34.761 --> 20:37.321
What did you feel at that moment?

20:37.441 --> 20:41.801
You mean... did I see a light
at the end of the tunnel?

20:42.401 --> 20:44.601
I don't think so.

20:45.441 --> 20:47.281
Pain?

20:49.361 --> 20:51.361
Peace.

20:56.521 --> 21:00.121
I can't take it anymore,
I have to talk to someone.

21:00.281 --> 21:04.641
And you're the only one
I can talk to, believe it or not.

21:09.321 --> 21:13.041
I can't get that image
out of my head...

21:13.561 --> 21:15.801
of her dying.

21:17.241 --> 21:20.081
Did you take that crap too?

21:20.241 --> 21:24.121
I didn't like what Fabrizio
had made me become.

21:24.281 --> 21:26.641
He'd say he did it
for your own good.

21:27.441 --> 21:30.361
His concept of what's good
was debatable.

21:33.801 --> 21:37.401
When Bianca died he put me
on a train to Milan.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.281
I didn't even go to her funeral.

21:42.841 --> 21:44.321
Dark.

21:44.521 --> 21:47.161
I remember your speech.
You were good.

21:48.601 --> 21:50.801
You looked so passionate...

21:50.961 --> 21:54.321
The secret is to pretend you believe.
It works every time.

21:54.441 --> 21:59.001
- Even when you're selling tortellini.
- No, you really did believe it.

22:00.201 --> 22:02.121
What is it, do you miss politics?

22:04.321 --> 22:06.161
You're talking like a therapist.

22:06.241 --> 22:10.441
- Next time you can pay me then.
- You're obsessed with money.

22:11.281 --> 22:14.441
Listen to the communist talk...
How much did you earn this month?

22:14.641 --> 22:18.961
The best defense from money
is to have it. Plenty of it.

22:19.121 --> 22:21.881
But, if I remember rightly,

22:22.041 --> 22:26.281
your speech was on the redistribution
of wealth. Isn't that bizarre?

22:26.401 --> 22:30.801
Well, I gave you 100 million liras.
How bizarre is that?

22:31.241 --> 22:34.321
What can I say?
Money flies nowadays.

22:35.041 --> 22:37.321
I'll leave you with your thoughts.

22:37.881 --> 22:39.561
You could at least pay.

22:39.721 --> 22:41.601
I forgot my wallet.

22:42.881 --> 22:46.401
- What the hell do you do with money?
- Never mind.

22:49.641 --> 22:51.561
Bye, buddy.

23:23.361 --> 23:28.321
<i>Leave a message after the beep
for Mr Dell'Utri.</i>

23:29.081 --> 23:31.361
Personal reasons?

23:33.881 --> 23:36.201
Are you sick, Pastore?

23:37.801 --> 23:41.721
You must be sick in the head to resign
from a job that everyone wants.

23:42.241 --> 23:45.081
You'll easily find a replacement then.

23:52.641 --> 23:57.561
This American army report from '79
makes things very clear.

23:58.601 --> 24:00.521
Here it is.

24:00.681 --> 24:02.841
Okay: "The use of uranium bullets

24:03.001 --> 24:06.081
endangers not only those
in the immediate vicinity

24:06.241 --> 24:09.321
but also those
who find themselves downwind.

24:09.441 --> 24:12.881
The particles settle
in the pulmonary tissue

24:13.001 --> 24:17.561
exposing the host to a toxic dose
of alpha radiation,

24:17.721 --> 24:21.881
that can cause cancer
and other fatal illnesses".

24:22.041 --> 24:26.281
Shit, could it be any clearer?
Take a look, if you don't believe me.

24:28.121 --> 24:29.681
Why are you telling me?

24:29.841 --> 24:33.001
Because plenty of other soldiers
may have fallen ill.

24:33.161 --> 24:34.641
So?

24:35.041 --> 24:37.601
Help me.

24:37.761 --> 24:40.361
How do I start a parliamentary
inquiry?

24:40.561 --> 24:44.321
Forget that, you need power
that you don't possess.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.721
At most you can request
a board of inquiry

24:47.881 --> 24:51.521
or an internal investigation,
that's all.

24:51.681 --> 24:54.001
Which one do you think
I should request?

24:54.201 --> 24:58.321
You're asking me if I'd rather
shoot myself or jump off a balcony.

24:59.321 --> 25:00.561
Meaning?

25:00.721 --> 25:03.441
That it'd be political suicide.

25:03.641 --> 25:09.521
There's no proof here
that depleted uranium was used.

25:09.681 --> 25:11.921
But there are plenty of cases,
it's written there.

25:12.081 --> 25:15.401
Yes, there are plenty,
but you have no proof.

25:17.361 --> 25:20.641
- I can't ignore this.
- You know what'll happen?

25:20.801 --> 25:24.201
The government is about to pass
the worst financial bill in history:

25:24.321 --> 25:25.841
30,000 billion liras!

25:26.001 --> 25:27.801
Notices of investigation
are pouring in,

25:27.961 --> 25:30.441
politicians are crapping themselves,
people are tense,

25:30.641 --> 25:33.441
all we need now is this story
about the army

25:33.641 --> 25:36.761
using weapons
that make soldiers fall ill!

25:40.801 --> 25:45.081
My friend has cancer.
And I promised to help him.

25:45.281 --> 25:47.041
This is politics:

25:47.401 --> 25:50.681
making promises, not keeping them.

26:16.121 --> 26:17.801
Pietro!

26:17.961 --> 26:20.361
I thought I'd got the wrong place.

26:20.561 --> 26:22.721
What did you expect?
The Grand Hotel?

26:22.881 --> 26:26.441
- How are you?
- Were those documents useful?

26:27.001 --> 26:29.601
Yes, I read them.

26:29.761 --> 26:32.001
What now?

26:33.161 --> 26:36.601
Now... I need some time.

26:37.201 --> 26:40.681
I need to find someone
who's willing to help.

26:40.841 --> 26:45.321
Okay, do what you have to do.
But the ball's rolling, right?

26:46.441 --> 26:50.921
Yes, but... it could take years.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.681
I know your type.

27:05.361 --> 27:07.721
First you act all brave,
"leave it to me",

27:07.881 --> 27:12.041
then you backtrack because
you don't have the guts to help me.

27:14.441 --> 27:17.681
Do you remember who I am?

27:19.161 --> 27:20.721
Do you remember?

27:20.921 --> 27:25.721
I got fired from the army
to save my colleague's honor!

27:25.881 --> 27:28.521
A dead colleague!
What did you do?

27:28.961 --> 27:31.081
You want to make me pay for that?

27:32.881 --> 27:36.761
You've changed, Pietro.
You've learnt to take orders.

28:24.401 --> 28:27.161
The partners' committee meeting
is tomorrow.

28:27.881 --> 28:29.761
What should I say?

28:29.921 --> 28:34.481
That the company has a new president
who will get it back on its feet.

28:37.441 --> 28:40.001
Maybe not dressed like that.

28:41.561 --> 28:43.721
It'll be fine.

28:45.121 --> 28:48.361
Your father would be proud of you.

29:12.961 --> 29:16.041
Bosco! Is the music too loud?

29:16.401 --> 29:18.521
I brought you this.

29:20.081 --> 29:21.721
Come on in.

29:21.881 --> 29:26.881
Life's too short for prosecco.
What we need is champagne.

29:27.881 --> 29:29.881
- You're sure?
- Come with me.

29:48.641 --> 29:50.601
Follow me, Bosco.

29:51.481 --> 29:54.121
You've never been up here, right?

29:54.281 --> 29:56.121
It's amazing!

29:56.281 --> 29:58.201
- Hello.
- Good evening.

30:11.721 --> 30:15.361
- I can introduce her to you to.
- I know her.

30:18.041 --> 30:19.361
Who is it?

30:21.121 --> 30:22.561
How marvelous!

30:22.721 --> 30:23.881
See you later.

30:33.001 --> 30:35.801
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Fuck you, you pushed me!

30:40.401 --> 30:41.921
Leave it to me.

30:43.001 --> 30:45.441
You need to put ice on it.

30:49.441 --> 30:52.281
Does it hurt? Can you move it?

30:54.001 --> 30:57.441
- Shouldn't she go to hospital?
- No!

30:57.601 --> 31:01.481
I played rugby for 15 years,
I've seen plenty of sprains.

31:01.881 --> 31:05.401
Then you're in good hands.

31:05.521 --> 31:06.641
Thanks.

31:11.081 --> 31:14.361
- The rugby player!
- It took you a while, didn't it?

31:15.161 --> 31:16.681
You look different.

31:16.841 --> 31:19.401
I'm an MP now.

31:20.321 --> 31:22.841
It's true. Northern League.

31:23.001 --> 31:24.841
How did you do that?

31:25.001 --> 31:27.801
I fought for it.

31:29.641 --> 31:32.721
- But you helped me too.
- Me?

31:33.841 --> 31:35.881
I thought a lot about you.

31:40.001 --> 31:41.401
Can I walk on it?

31:42.241 --> 31:45.521
You can use it to go downstairs,
to my house.

31:45.681 --> 31:47.401
Stay as long as you like.

31:48.401 --> 31:51.321
- You can have my bed...
- Oh, I see.

31:52.521 --> 31:55.041
Go on, try putting it down.

31:56.601 --> 31:58.681
Lean on me.

31:59.641 --> 32:04.561
Listen, that old guy
who was touching you before...

32:04.721 --> 32:08.361
- Don't let him treat you like that.
- It's my damn business.

32:08.801 --> 32:11.801
This lot just want to screw you.

32:12.841 --> 32:15.041
They don't respect you.

32:16.441 --> 32:20.361
If you were my girlfriend,
I'd look after you.

32:22.721 --> 32:26.841
- I called a taxi. Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.

32:29.041 --> 32:31.201
Let me help you.

32:40.201 --> 32:44.601
<i>Parini, the honest face of
the Socialists, will cooperate,</i>

32:44.761 --> 32:47.161
<i>while the secretary Bettino Craxi</i>

32:47.321 --> 32:52.001
<i>will make his long-awaited speech
at the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow.</i>

33:04.601 --> 33:07.401
<i>I'm not home, leave a message.</i>

33:07.601 --> 33:08.961
<i>Luca, it's me.</i>

33:09.881 --> 33:12.481
<i>I've thought about
everything you said.</i>

33:12.641 --> 33:15.681
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

33:15.841 --> 33:18.561
<i>I really am so sorry.</i>

33:18.721 --> 33:21.921
<i>Maybe if this
hadn't happened to you</i>

33:22.081 --> 33:24.881
<i>and if I weren't
my father's daughter,</i>

33:25.041 --> 33:27.721
<i>perhaps me and you...</i>

33:27.881 --> 33:31.201
<i>I don't know, we'll never know.</i>

33:44.681 --> 33:46.081
JULY 3rd

33:46.161 --> 33:49.801
However, what needs to be said
and what everyone knows

33:49.961 --> 33:55.161
is that the greater part of political
funding is irregular or illegal.

33:55.801 --> 34:00.761
<i>The parties and those who rely on
party machines, large or small,</i>

34:01.321 --> 34:05.001
<i>on newspapers, promotional
and associational activities,</i>

34:05.161 --> 34:10.721
<i>and also many various political
operational facilities,</i>

34:10.881 --> 34:16.201
<i>have had or have recourse
to additional resources</i>

34:16.281 --> 34:19.321
<i>which are irregular or illegal.</i>

34:20.001 --> 34:22.041
<i>If the greater part of this</i>

34:22.201 --> 34:26.681
<i>is to be considered
criminal behavior, pure and simple,</i>

34:26.841 --> 34:31.161
<i>then the greater part of the system
is a criminal system.</i>

34:32.801 --> 34:38.321
<i>I do not believe
there is anyone in this hall</i>

34:38.401 --> 34:43.481
<i>responsible for a large organization
who can stand up</i>

34:43.641 --> 34:47.721
<i>and under oath deny
what I have just said,</i>

34:47.881 --> 34:50.561
<i>because sooner or later</i>

34:50.721 --> 34:55.281
<i>the facts would prove him
to be a liar.</i>

35:04.681 --> 35:05.961
How can I help?

35:06.201 --> 35:07.841
Go ahead.

35:09.001 --> 35:10.401
Good morning.

35:10.561 --> 35:14.601
I've come to pick up my results.
The name's Pastore.

35:17.921 --> 35:19.361
Thanks.

36:00.961 --> 36:03.001
- Piercamillo, shall we go?
- I'm coming.

36:04.321 --> 36:05.881
- Goodbye, guys.
- Goodbye.

36:06.401 --> 36:09.721
Pastore, didn't you resign?

36:10.361 --> 36:11.881
I changed my mind.

36:13.001 --> 36:16.681
You can't just come and go
as you please.

36:16.801 --> 36:20.321
A guy on TV said that
the whole system is corrupt.

36:20.481 --> 36:23.881
So someone has to fight this system.

36:24.081 --> 36:29.161
We'll give Craxi a run for his money.
We're going to nab his mate Ligresti.

36:29.561 --> 36:31.761
Get to work, Pastore.

36:34.241 --> 36:36.041
Welcome back.

36:37.321 --> 36:39.361
A role for me, huh?

36:41.081 --> 36:43.081
Sorry, I have to go.

36:43.241 --> 36:45.961
Three lines. And one's off-camera.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.161
- But you're the protagonist's girl!
- Who dies on page 6.

36:49.321 --> 36:53.161
It's a nice death though.
It's spectacular, what's wrong?

36:53.721 --> 36:57.961
Listen poppet, you know
what Marilyn's first role was?

36:58.121 --> 37:01.961
An invisible one: she played
a phone operator like you!

37:02.121 --> 37:07.121
If it weren't for me, you'd still be
on TV answering phones!

37:07.281 --> 37:09.401
You said I'd become a star
with you.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.361
You got a role with
an Oscar-winning director!

37:12.521 --> 37:18.001
Other girls would kill their mothers
for this, and you're complaining?

37:18.161 --> 37:20.681
I believed you, I slept with you!
You conned me.

37:20.841 --> 37:25.081
Listen darling, I've got plenty of girls
ready to sleep with me,

37:25.241 --> 37:29.961
and with the whole film crew
just to get a part, understood?

37:30.201 --> 37:33.921
You come out of nowhere
and you want a lead role?

37:34.081 --> 37:39.681
You expect me to give the lead role
to Veronica Castello?

37:39.841 --> 37:42.881
Do you even know how to act?

37:57.001 --> 37:58.961
You can't go.

38:00.561 --> 38:04.481
- Are you going to pay for my room?
- Yes, I'll pay for it.

38:08.761 --> 38:11.601
What the hell do you want?
You said your bit.

38:11.761 --> 38:14.561
Denmark's won the European
Championships, did you know?

38:16.641 --> 38:18.081
So?

38:18.161 --> 38:24.841
That means anyone can succeed,
even those who count for nothing.

38:26.361 --> 38:30.001
I'm not fucking like them!

38:30.161 --> 38:31.881
Maybe I'll fail,

38:32.041 --> 38:35.881
but I swear
I'll do everything I can.

38:36.201 --> 38:38.281
You got that?

38:38.441 --> 38:40.481
Fuck you.

38:42.441 --> 38:45.521
You made me doubt you, dumbass.

38:48.321 --> 38:50.641
Honorable Bosco!

39:01.041 --> 39:02.441
A beer, please.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.841
Sir...

39:05.001 --> 39:06.641
Sir...

39:07.401 --> 39:08.841
Ligresti?

39:09.361 --> 39:11.641
He wasn't there. He's left.

39:11.801 --> 39:14.041
Somebody tipped him off.

39:15.161 --> 39:18.561
- Someone from our office?
- Who the hell else?

39:20.201 --> 39:22.801
- That can't be possible...
- That's what you think...

39:22.881 --> 39:26.281
Wake up, we're going after
the richest damn men in Italy.

39:26.441 --> 39:30.441
How long will it take them
to bribe someone? No time!

39:31.881 --> 39:35.521
I don't trust anyone anymore.
Not even you.

39:36.161 --> 39:38.401
- Where's my beer?
- Here.

39:38.641 --> 39:40.121
Thanks.

40:13.081 --> 40:15.241
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:15.761 --> 40:16.721
Hi.

40:21.201 --> 40:25.681
For a long time I thought I'd kill
your father then kill myself.

40:26.881 --> 40:31.081
Then your father beat me to it:
he always ruins everything.

40:31.321 --> 40:33.441
Then I realized something else:

40:33.801 --> 40:36.761
unless you get rid
of the root of evil

40:36.921 --> 40:38.561
it'll return.

40:38.921 --> 40:40.721
I don't understand.

40:42.121 --> 40:44.481
I see you've taken
your father's place.

40:47.801 --> 40:50.321
Now you can help me
to report everything.

40:51.561 --> 40:53.001
His crimes,

40:53.161 --> 40:57.281
those of the pharmaceutical system
and of the Ministry of Health.

40:58.241 --> 41:00.721
You can help me expose everything.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.801
Did you mean what you said?

41:26.241 --> 41:28.001
What?

41:28.921 --> 41:31.681
What you said the other night.

41:33.321 --> 41:34.561
Well?

41:37.921 --> 41:40.001
Answer me.

41:41.641 --> 41:43.041
Yes...

41:44.721 --> 41:46.921
I meant it.

42:07.921 --> 42:10.601
- Aren't you afraid?
- Of you?

42:12.441 --> 42:14.961
To have sex with someone
who's sick.

42:15.401 --> 42:17.241
Don't you have a condom?

42:17.401 --> 42:20.641
It's not that,
I can't get it out of my mind.

42:22.521 --> 42:25.281
I'll help you forget about it.

42:52.401 --> 42:54.801
Dad? There's a man here
to see you.

43:04.041 --> 43:06.281
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

43:09.321 --> 43:11.281
Why are you here?

43:11.441 --> 43:15.601
Don't you remember calling me
last night?

43:15.761 --> 43:17.441
Oh God...

43:18.361 --> 43:20.201
I thought as much.

43:24.601 --> 43:26.761
<i>Recorded messages.</i>

43:29.361 --> 43:31.881
<i>I read your book on samurais.</i>

43:32.041 --> 43:35.241
<i>It says great enterprises
aren't created with sobriety.</i>

43:35.401 --> 43:39.521
<i>I'm not very sober right now.
But that's not the point.</i>

43:39.681 --> 43:43.721
<i>The truth is that I miss
belonging to something...</i>

43:44.841 --> 43:46.801
A drunken rant.

43:52.841 --> 43:56.161
I recently attended
the commemoration

43:56.321 --> 44:00.881
of the 350th anniversary
of Galileo Galilei's death.

44:01.081 --> 44:03.641
He was a real dickhead too,

44:04.881 --> 44:06.761
but he had the right idea.

44:10.001 --> 44:13.001
I don't know
if you have the right idea, Notte...

44:15.041 --> 44:18.721
but I find your perspective on things
interesting.

44:19.761 --> 44:21.921
Why don't you work for us again?

44:22.801 --> 44:25.481
Our Gali-Leo Notte.

44:27.801 --> 44:29.481
Thank you.

44:31.361 --> 44:34.321
You said you didn't have children.

44:38.481 --> 44:42.321
Is there anything else
I should know about you?

44:45.481 --> 44:47.161
No.

44:49.561 --> 44:52.921
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

45:11.801 --> 45:15.361
NEXT TIME

45:28.281 --> 45:31.641
- Stop! Shit, are you nuts?
- What's the matter?

45:31.721 --> 45:32.841
- You're sick!
- Pietro, stop!

45:37.201 --> 45:40.321
I remember you being a smart woman.
