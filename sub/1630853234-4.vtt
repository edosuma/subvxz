WEBVTT

00:14.931 --> 00:17.892
Miles calling again.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.638
Come on.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.955
Keys to the guesthouse.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.208
Night.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.386
It's always warm.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.763
Short sleeves in December.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.600
And we can have a lemon tree
in our backyard.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.852
Promise?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.188
Promise.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.066
When, Mama?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.361
Soon.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.047
Hope you don't mind.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.925
I ordered groceries
and made breakfast.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.678
Mole chilaquiles. You like?

03:02.515 --> 03:03.808
Love.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.895
Prosecco?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.481
No.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.902
Actually...

03:17.363 --> 03:20.033
Miles has been
calling nonstop.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.744
Of course he has.
He's terrified.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.123
First time we went
grocery shopping together,

03:27.165 --> 03:29.500
I asked him to grab olive oil.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.545
He picked the most
expensive bottle.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.589
$38.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.716
I should've run then.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.431
I grew up poor.
I hate wasting money.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.726
My mom and I never met
a coupon we didn't like.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.147
What do your parents do?

03:52.398 --> 03:54.484
I never met my dad.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.487
Same.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.821
Your mom?

03:58.863 --> 04:01.241
My mom's an artist.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.289
Mine was an alcoholic.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.583
I was a big distraction
in her life.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.502
Do you still see her?

04:12.543 --> 04:15.546
Haven't seen her in 20 years.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.388
You have a boyfriend?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.890
No.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.602
Are you and Marty...?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.603
He listens to Pearl Jam

04:30.645 --> 04:32.563
and doesn't know
who Clifford Odets is.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.191
Not my vibe.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.366
Travis told me...

04:44.701 --> 04:47.328
You and Redmond...

04:47.370 --> 04:49.580
back in the day.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.341
Not willingly.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.472
But it's a million
years ago, so...

05:06.514 --> 05:08.850
Did you ever tell anyone?

05:08.891 --> 05:12.103
Back then, we didn't talk
about things like this.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.148
He's still manipulating you,
calling the shots.

05:15.189 --> 05:18.651
It is what it is, Lou.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.361
And you better tell Travis

05:20.403 --> 05:23.489
to mind his own
fucking business.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.825
Understood?
- Yeah.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.125
I don't feel like
working today.

face of Danny Trejo.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.201
Let me see.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.329
Oh, my God.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.040
I am so glad
I'm not young anymore.

08:19.081 --> 08:22.793
Dating apps are like
Postmates for sexual fantasies.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.421
You can order
whatever you want.

08:53.074 --> 08:57.161
You deserve so much better.

08:58.996 --> 09:02.458
I'm not so easy
to live with, myself.

09:06.420 --> 09:10.049
An acquired taste,
my mother used to say.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.023
So what would you order?

09:26.065 --> 09:27.483
Huh?

09:29.068 --> 09:31.070
Nothing.
- Tell me.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.907
I don't have
fantasies anymore.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.200
I'm too old.
- Bullshit.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.035
Come on.

never done you wish you had?

Uh...

09:54.135 --> 09:57.430

Lou, I need to see you
in my office.

13:35.272 --> 13:38.275
This weekend...

13:38.317 --> 13:41.237
what happened...

13:41.278 --> 13:43.531
I was upset.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.536
I'm sorry,
did something happen?

14:19.024 --> 14:20.985
You said you were always
fine with me stepping out--

14:21.026 --> 14:23.779
It's a judgment thing, Miles,
and it's just

14:23.821 --> 14:26.365
so unbelievably disrespectful
during this delicate time.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.575
You know what?
It's fucking hard.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.118
It's hard
living in your shadow.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.287
Oh, please,
don't play the victim!

14:31.328 --> 14:33.414
It's a massive turnoff.
- You don't think this

14:33.455 --> 14:36.667
pregnancy and miscarriage thing
has taken a toll on me, too?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.420
It's not just about you.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.256
I know it's been
a horrific three years,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.508
which is why we're turning
to alternative methods.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.843
Yeah, with complete
fucking strangers.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.636
I'm not doing that.
I told you I'd rather adopt.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.388
I'm not adopting.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.348
Pick one.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.267
No, I'm not
fucking picking one!

14:53.309 --> 14:54.977
Okay? It's fucking crazy.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.395
It's my sperm, mine.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.231
None of this,
none of this is yours!

14:59.273 --> 15:01.775
You can't have a fucking kid.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.989
Oh, fuck.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.036
Take a look around, Miles.

15:13.662 --> 15:17.958
Take a look at your life,
because all of this is mine,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.837
and I choose
to share it with you.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.174
You were fucking nothing
when I met you.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.593
And now I'm everything!

15:27.635 --> 15:30.012
So don't push me.

15:31.513 --> 15:35.351
I might decide that
I don't like sharing anymore.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.744
Coverage on "Islands of Stone"?

15:53.786 --> 15:57.039
- It's a 388-page book.
- She wants it by noon.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.958
Did you confirm
her lunch today?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.834
Did you?

16:02.127 --> 16:04.463
Oh, fuck me, I'm out of Prep.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.090
What's that?

16:06.131 --> 16:07.424
Gay thing.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.510
I'm headed down to set.
Lou, come with me.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.470
Update my software,
walk Wesley,

16:11.512 --> 16:14.473
and go get me
a GoMacro bar, please.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.901
Sometimes being here
feels like I'm in a dream.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.946
All the people
that have passed through here--

16:28.988 --> 16:32.658
Mary Pickford, Judy Garland,

16:32.700 --> 16:35.035
Katharine Hepburn.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.498
I used to feel that way.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.417
You don't anymore?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.420
As a woman here,

16:44.461 --> 16:46.422
you start to feel like
you're supporting a system

16:46.463 --> 16:49.883
that doesn't want
to support you.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.593
It's hard to get
back to the magic

16:51.635 --> 16:53.804
and promise of it all.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.474
Does the magic of Hollywood
even still exist?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.730
You should get out
before it fucks you up.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.866
Looking good.

17:13.907 --> 17:17.286
"Good"? That's all I get?

17:17.327 --> 17:18.704
Good?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.873
Joyce...

17:20.914 --> 17:22.583
he's here.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.629
I've got some contracts
for Mr. Goya.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.631
I think it's incredible--

17:29.673 --> 17:33.177
the performances,
the way you're shooting it.

17:33.635 --> 17:38.015
I'm a total nobody around here,
but I'm blown away.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.143
- Cute shoes.
- CELINE.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.478
Yeah.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.273
I kind of miss the braids
and thrift-store shit.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.152
Let's go.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.203
This is a classic romance.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.621
Red states don't want to see

18:00.662 --> 18:02.664
some Black guy
kissing a white girl.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.625
I'm gonna pretend you
didn't just say that.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.543
What were you thinking,
Joyce?

18:06.585 --> 18:10.339
In this political climate,
it's just way too polarizing.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.133
We're gonna have to recast.
- That's dinosaur thinking.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.302
Well, I'm T.-fucking-rex.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.555
- Redmond, please just--
- It's not your fucking movie!

18:18.597 --> 18:19.807
It's my fucking movie,

18:19.848 --> 18:22.893
and I don't want to see
some Black fucking day player

18:22.935 --> 18:25.395
making out
with my white female lead,

18:25.437 --> 18:27.397
and the other half
of this country

18:27.439 --> 18:30.484
doesn't want to see it either!

18:30.526 --> 18:32.236
Get me a new cast list.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.823
Otherwise, I will shut
this thing down so fast,

18:35.864 --> 18:37.741
you won't know what hit you.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.042
Get these refilled for Wesley
at Larchmont Animal Hospital,

18:47.084 --> 18:48.544
then bring them back to me.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.546
No boyfriend...

18:50.587 --> 18:52.965
no friends...

18:53.006 --> 18:55.008
no social media.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.762
Within months
of you showing up,

18:58.804 --> 19:03.308
Alex just
falls off the wagon and ODs,

19:03.350 --> 19:05.144
after being sober for years.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.521
The implication being
I got rid of him

19:07.563 --> 19:09.439
so I could get
his crummy assistant job

19:09.481 --> 19:12.734
working for a woman
who's a notorious nightmare?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.280
Pretty thin.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.323
And if I really was
that duplicitous

19:18.365 --> 19:19.575
and needed one of you gone,

19:19.616 --> 19:23.120
wouldn't it have been you
at the bottom of the pool?

19:25.122 --> 19:27.124
And yet...

19:27.166 --> 19:29.209
here you stand before me.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.742
You replace the dead kid?

20:01.783 --> 20:03.702
Not technically.

20:04.912 --> 20:05.996
Just helping out.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.123
Oh, you're a girl.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.500
She never hires girls.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.838
You'd fuck him, right?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.883
Um...

20:17.925 --> 20:19.551
well, I guess so.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.511
But--
- But what?

20:24.431 --> 20:28.143
Something's been circulated
between the assistants

20:28.185 --> 20:31.146
I think you should hear, sir.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.195
Red states don't want to see

20:38.237 --> 20:40.113
some Black guy
kissing a white girl.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.698
What were you thinking, Joyce?

20:41.740 --> 20:45.369
In this political climate,
it's just way too polarizing.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.287
We're gonna have to recast.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.163
Who taped that?

20:48.205 --> 20:49.456
It's not your fucking movie!

20:49.498 --> 20:51.041
- I have no idea.
- Bullshit!

20:51.083 --> 20:52.459
Who sent it?

20:52.501 --> 20:55.045
Legal's trying to track
where it originated from.

20:55.087 --> 20:59.800
But what if this lands
in the media's laps,

20:59.841 --> 21:02.552
especially now...

21:02.594 --> 21:04.221
given the political climate?

21:04.263 --> 21:07.766
Are you trying to
blackmail me, little girl?

21:09.101 --> 21:11.436
You're hurting me.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.606
Well, toughen the fuck up.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.782
He had a change of heart.
We're not recasting.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.745
Where have you been
all my life?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.455
Happy to help.

21:30.497 --> 21:32.165
Let Meredith know.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.667
Copy.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.549
Time for bed, my sweet boy.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.514
Wesley.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.599
Time for bed.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.312
Baby.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.982
Miles!

21:59.651 --> 22:01.862
- I am so sorry.
- Stop apologizing.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.488
I don't know
how my medication

22:03.530 --> 22:04.656
got mixed up with Wesley's.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.241
You almost killed my dog.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.951
- Joyce, please--
- Get out.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.995
- Joyce.
- You're fired.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.413
Get out!
- Joyce!

22:11.455 --> 22:13.999
Get out. Out!

22:34.019 --> 22:36.271
I'm gonna
take you down, bitch.

22:38.357 --> 22:43.153
Mark my words,
you filthy little cunt.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.865
I'm sorry things
didn't work out.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.538
I wish you all the best.
