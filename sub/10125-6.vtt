19:06.900 --> 19:09.033
I GOT A GUY OUT BACK.

19:09.033 --> 19:10.133
DO YOU REALLY?

19:10.133 --> 19:12.300
I DON'T KNOW.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.834
DO YOU FEEL LUCKY?

19:16.934 --> 19:18.300
HEY,
IT'S NOT GOODBYE.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.000
I'LL FIND OUT
WHERE YOU END UP

19:21.000 --> 19:22.667
AND COME VISIT YOU.

19:22.667 --> 19:23.800
I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

19:23.800 --> 19:26.600
BEING PASSED AROUND
FROM HOME TO HOME.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.800
HERE'S
LOOKING AT YOU, PIG.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.400
YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS PIG.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
TOPANGA LAWRENCE?

19:35.400 --> 19:38.000
GOING WITH CORY MATTHEWS
FOR TWO MONTHS.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.567
I'M WAY OVERQUALIFIED
FOR THIS JOB.

19:41.567 --> 19:42.934
AFTER I SPOKE TO YOU,

19:42.934 --> 19:46.133
I SAW THIS AD
FOR A LOST PIG.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.567
I CALLED ITS OWNERS.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.734
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TAKE HIM.

19:49.734 --> 19:51.367
ISN'T THAT GREAT, SHAWN?

19:51.367 --> 19:52.934
I STILL LOSE
LITTLE CORY.

19:52.934 --> 19:54.734
DOESN'T MATTER
WHO OWNS HIM.

19:54.734 --> 19:55.734
IT'S NOT ME.

19:55.734 --> 19:57.400
HERE'S THE OWNER.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.000
HI. NAME'S TURNER.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.133
I GOT A PLACE
OUTSIDE THE CITY,

20:00.133 --> 20:02.200
AND THIS LITTLE GUY
RAN OFF.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.667
IT BELONGS TO MY BOY,
ZED.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.734
ZED?
ZED?
ZED?

20:08.800 --> 20:09.867
IS THIS REALLY YOUR PIG?

20:09.867 --> 20:11.767
NO, MY ARK IS OUTSIDE,

20:11.767 --> 20:14.300
AND I'M ONE PIG SHORT.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.700
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.233
HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD.

20:17.233 --> 20:19.500
WE'RE GOING DOWNTOWN.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.200
YOU KIDDING ME?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.200
YES, I AM.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.000
TWO CAN PLAY
THIS SARCASM GAME.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.600
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S YOUR PIG.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.700
GIVE MY BEST TO ZED.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.734
YOU KNOW, THAT OFFER
FOR THE 20-FOOT BOA,

20:34.734 --> 20:35.900
IT'S STILL GOOD.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.467
I'LL THINK
ABOUT IT.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.100
YOU GOT A CARD?

20:39.100 --> 20:40.100
YEAH, RIGHT.

20:40.100 --> 20:42.734
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A BADGE.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.567
HUNTER,
I MUST REALLY LIKE YOU.

20:49.567 --> 20:51.700
THANKS, MAN.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.100
TOPANGA, YOU THOUGHT
I COULDN'T

20:55.100 --> 20:56.667
GIVE LITTLE CORY
A GOOD HOME.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.500
WHY'D YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

20:58.500 --> 21:00.100
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.667
FIRST, IT'S NOT MY PIG.

21:02.667 --> 21:03.967
IT'S YOURS.

21:03.967 --> 21:05.200
THERE'S A START.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.900
AND I'VE KNOWN YOU
AS LONG AS
I'VE KNOWN CORY.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.133
YOU'RE NOT
JUST MY BOYFRIEND'S FRIEND,

21:11.133 --> 21:13.767
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, TOO.

21:18.734 --> 21:19.734
YOU KNOW,

21:19.734 --> 21:23.600
I THINK
THE PIG'S
TEARING UP.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.934
MORE! MORE!

21:30.934 --> 21:32.000
WHOO-HOO!

21:32.000 --> 21:34.800
ALL RIGHT, MR. MATTHEWS,
THE SHOW'S OVER.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.200
LET'S GO.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.400
MORE! MORE!

21:39.400 --> 21:42.000
MR. FEENY, YOU OPENED UP
THIS WHOLE NEW WORLD.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.033
WOMEN WILL BE SO IMPRESSED
WITH MY CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE.

21:45.033 --> 21:48.033
FORTISSIMO! OH, WHO KNEW?

21:49.133 --> 21:51.900
YOU DID VERY WELL
FOR YOUR FIRST TIME.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.867
NOW CAN WE GO?
I'M TIRED.

21:53.867 --> 21:55.200
AND A BIT CRANKY.

21:55.200 --> 21:59.000
WHAT HAPPENS
IF I MEET SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T LIKE OPERA,

21:59.000 --> 22:00.400
BUT LIKES BALLET?

22:00.400 --> 22:01.700
CAN WE GO SEE THAT?

22:01.700 --> 22:03.667
CAN WE SEE
THE PHILHARMONIC?

22:03.667 --> 22:05.867
YES. MAY WE GO?

22:05.867 --> 22:06.934
I JUST CAN'T LEAVE

22:06.934 --> 22:09.100
UNTIL SOMETHING
REALLY BIG HAPPENS.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.567
NOTHING BIG HAPPENS.

22:10.567 --> 22:12.000
IT JUST ENDS.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.767
WAIT.
WHO'S THAT FAT LADY?

22:13.767 --> 22:15.300
♪ AHH ♪

22:15.300 --> 22:17.834
O.K., WE CAN GO NOW.
