04:59.475 --> 05:00.516
Jamie!

05:03.937 --> 05:05.772
Jamie, off the grass!

05:06.315 --> 05:08.191
Off the grass!

05:17.367 --> 05:19.535
Nice plane finish!

05:22.080 --> 05:25.917
- Which side will win the war?
- Ours, of course.

05:26.126 --> 05:30.379
- Oh, that war.
- Well, China isn't our war.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.257
We're awfully lucky.

05:33.675 --> 05:37.220
- Living here, having everything.
- Naughty!

05:38.722 --> 05:42.183
The harder I work, the luckier we get.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.478
I only meant lucky.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.941
Luckier than him.

05:51.068 --> 05:54.570
We're luckier than most.
He's luckier than some.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.865
Out of the way.
Chip across the water.

05:58.075 --> 06:02.870
The Japanese will win. They've got
better planes and braver pilots.

06:03.121 --> 06:06.249
I may join the Japanese Air Force.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.834
For heaven's sake!

06:09.253 --> 06:13.172
Father, look! Zero Sen!
It's my plane! Zero Sen!

06:37.865 --> 06:40.533
Amah, I'll have...

06:40.951 --> 06:42.451
...the butter biscuits.

06:43.412 --> 06:45.621
Mrs. Graham, she...

06:46.290 --> 06:49.208
...not want you eat before bed.

06:53.338 --> 06:55.506
You have to do what I say.

06:57.509 --> 07:00.386
--backed by
reinforcements into Malaya....

07:00.596 --> 07:04.891
...certain to influence Japan against
further military action.

07:05.100 --> 07:10.062
As Far East tensions grow,
British nationals evacuate...

07:10.272 --> 07:12.565
...for Australia and India.

07:13.066 --> 07:18.237
A steamer left Shanghai yesterday
with 450 British on board...

07:18.447 --> 07:19.906
...to Hong Kong.

07:20.157 --> 07:23.576
A third of occupied China's
British community...

07:23.785 --> 07:27.788
...estimated at 15,000, has left
in recent weeks.

07:27.998 --> 07:30.625
Little hope of progress remains...

07:30.834 --> 07:34.795
...between Roosevelt
and the Japanese ambassador.

07:35.005 --> 07:39.467
Singapore revealed that Japanese
forces in Indochina...

07:39.676 --> 07:43.804
...have reached the strength of
perhaps 50,000.

07:53.565 --> 07:54.732
Hello...

07:56.151 --> 07:57.485
...Ace.

08:01.615 --> 08:05.284
- I was dreaming about God.
- What did he say?

08:06.286 --> 08:09.580
Nothing. He was playing tennis.

08:12.584 --> 08:15.461
Perhaps that's where God is
all the time.

08:16.004 --> 08:18.547
It's why you can't see him.

08:18.757 --> 08:21.300
I don't know about God.

08:21.969 --> 08:27.014
- Good night, Jamie.
- Perhaps he's our dream...

08:27.516 --> 08:29.016
...and we're his.

08:29.977 --> 08:34.145
Go to sleep. It's the Lockwoods,
party tomorrow.

08:34.563 --> 08:36.774
Can I take my glider?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.402
Dream of flying.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.125
Mother...

08:54.751 --> 08:59.588
...if God is above us, does it mean
up, like flying?

09:00.424 --> 09:01.590
Good night.

09:59.399 --> 10:03.986
- Mistress, very beautiful.
- Thank you, Amah. Off we go.

10:06.031 --> 10:08.199
Behave yourself.

10:08.492 --> 10:10.117
Thank you, Yang.

10:12.788 --> 10:14.246
Squeeze up.

10:16.458 --> 10:20.878
Mind the plane. Prop it against
the seat. Right, Yang.

10:32.349 --> 10:34.266
Settle down, Sinbad!

10:44.361 --> 10:48.197
Take the Wang Pu Road.
Let's avoid the crowds.

11:17.561 --> 11:21.147
- See you back on board.
- See you, Charlie.

11:21.356 --> 11:24.108
Green apples! Green apples!

11:57.767 --> 12:01.353
No mama. No papa.
No whiskey soda.

12:18.997 --> 12:22.124
Slow down. Checkpoint coming up.

13:24.562 --> 13:27.356
God rest ye merry gentlemen

13:27.565 --> 13:29.817
Hello, darling.
Lovely to see you.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.194
- Big kisses.
- There he is.

13:32.445 --> 13:36.699
- Leave Shanghai while you can.
- They leave us alone.

13:36.908 --> 13:39.535
Lockwood's invited a Chink.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.497
Sorry, but don't mind him.

13:43.707 --> 13:46.625
- English humor?
- Scottish whiskey.

13:46.835 --> 13:48.377
Are our days numbered?

13:48.586 --> 13:51.714
All our days are numbered.
Ours higher than yours.

13:51.923 --> 13:56.010
You've been in Shanghai 100 years.
It's only an incident.

13:56.219 --> 13:58.721
The Japanese, four years. Nothing.

13:58.930 --> 14:03.267
Long enough to spoil your harvest
and steal what's left of it.

14:03.476 --> 14:07.521
A million Chinese peasants are
trying to enter Shanghai.

14:07.731 --> 14:10.107
The Japanese get hungry too.

14:10.317 --> 14:14.236
We have the guns, the planes
and 500 million fighting back.

14:14.446 --> 14:17.990
- We'll be here after every war.
- Here's to that.

14:18.241 --> 14:20.242
I hope we'll be here too.

14:20.452 --> 14:23.287
Always delighted to return
hospitality.

14:23.538 --> 14:27.875
- Very good. Utterly convincing.
- Thank you.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.227
Zero?

14:47.854 --> 14:51.190
Nakajima. Two machine guns.

14:51.399 --> 14:55.110
I rely on you for keeping up-to-date
on the war.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.738
Especially military aviation.

14:57.947 --> 15:02.951
- I hear you resigned from the Scouts.
- I'm now an atheist.

15:03.161 --> 15:06.538
- Where are you going?
- To see something!

15:23.056 --> 15:24.181
Oh.

15:24.349 --> 15:26.600
Your boy tells me he's an atheist.

15:26.810 --> 15:28.685
Always thought he was.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.688
- Chow time.
- Thank you.

16:54.564 --> 16:56.398
Enemy aircraft sighted!

17:12.665 --> 17:15.250
He's on my tail! On my tail!

18:31.286 --> 18:32.536
Jamie!

18:33.246 --> 18:34.288
Jamie!

18:34.747 --> 18:36.665
Stand still, John.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.853
Jamie.

18:58.521 --> 19:00.230
Don't run.

19:16.998 --> 19:19.625
Come, you're
missing the party.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.336
- I left my plane.
- Never mind.

19:22.545 --> 19:24.421
- Don't look back.
- Thanks.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.424
They're waiting for something
to happen.

19:27.634 --> 19:31.720
- They didn't look angry.
- It's not anger. It's patience.

19:31.929 --> 19:36.308
- Is it time to close ranks?
- Get Mary and the boy out.

19:36.517 --> 19:38.769
Somewhere safe. Singapore?

20:13.262 --> 20:15.681
We're moving into the hotel.

20:15.932 --> 20:19.434
- Why?
- To see how things are going.

20:20.603 --> 20:23.605
I don't want you two alone
in the house.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.061
Jamie?

22:26.729 --> 22:29.147
I didn't mean it. It was a joke.

22:29.941 --> 22:32.150
Keep away from the window.

22:32.360 --> 22:36.988
Get dressed. Do what Mother
tells you. We're leaving.

22:39.033 --> 22:40.492
I am dressed.

22:42.328 --> 22:46.039
- Am I going to school?
- There's no school today.

22:46.249 --> 22:48.708
We'll see if Yang can take us home.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.592
Never mind the suitcase. Come on!

23:39.343 --> 23:43.138
- Taxi! Over here! Taxi!
- Excuse me!

23:48.394 --> 23:51.271
Good heavens, this is ridiculous!

23:55.276 --> 23:59.571
- Keep holding my hand!
- Stop shoving me!

24:05.202 --> 24:07.704
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Yang!

24:15.421 --> 24:16.504
Quickly!

24:24.347 --> 24:27.098
Yang, get us to the waterfront.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.731
Jamie, for God's sake, sit down!

25:24.824 --> 25:27.409
Jamie, get out of the car. Quickly!

25:43.134 --> 25:45.385
- What will we do?
- Get out.

25:45.594 --> 25:48.888
Perhaps there'll be a boat.
Sorry. Max was right.

25:49.098 --> 25:50.265
Don't push me!

25:51.225 --> 25:52.475
Mary!

25:52.685 --> 25:54.310
Hold on to him!

25:57.314 --> 25:59.024
John!

26:01.068 --> 26:02.402
John!

26:05.322 --> 26:06.614
- Hold on.
- John!

26:06.824 --> 26:11.119
Stay together! Hang on to Jamie!

26:18.169 --> 26:21.463
Jamie, don't let go!

26:33.893 --> 26:34.976
My plane!

26:35.478 --> 26:36.895
Jamie!

26:40.691 --> 26:45.653
Mum?

26:51.243 --> 26:54.204
Mum! Mummy!

26:54.413 --> 26:55.663
Jamie!

26:55.873 --> 27:00.877
Mummy! Mum! No!

27:01.045 --> 27:02.962
Jamie! Jamie!

27:03.255 --> 27:08.343
Go home. I'll find you there! Go home!

27:09.512 --> 27:11.262
Mummy!

29:03.542 --> 29:28.858
Mother!

29:37.326 --> 29:38.743
Mama?

29:42.498 --> 29:43.998
Father!

30:14.113 --> 30:15.530
Mother!

31:42.451 --> 31:44.285
What do you think you're doing?

31:52.294 --> 31:54.670
Where's my mother and father?

35:51.992 --> 35:53.492
Come on, man!
Come on, kid!

35:55.621 --> 35:56.954
Come on!

35:58.749 --> 36:00.750
Wait! Wait!

36:03.253 --> 36:04.629
Come on!

36:06.048 --> 36:07.632
Come on, cycle harder!

36:09.885 --> 36:11.135
Wait!

36:11.386 --> 36:12.428
Please!

37:09.903 --> 37:11.654
Excuse me, everyone.

37:15.826 --> 37:17.368
I surrender.

37:18.912 --> 37:21.997
"I surrender.
I surrender. I surrender."

38:17.804 --> 38:21.682
No mama! No papa! No whiskey soda!

38:24.519 --> 38:26.061
American boy?

38:26.646 --> 38:29.106
- American boy?
- English.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.484
English?

38:32.694 --> 38:35.070
I'm waiting for my chauffeur.

38:35.489 --> 38:37.072
English boy.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.577
English boy, you come now.

38:43.038 --> 38:44.413
Thank you.

38:45.624 --> 38:46.916
You come now.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.959
- You come now.
- No! No!

38:50.337 --> 38:51.712
Hey!

38:51.880 --> 38:53.088
English boy!

38:59.221 --> 39:02.348
Hey! Hey, English boy!

39:09.940 --> 39:13.275
I surrender! I surrender. Please!

39:15.946 --> 39:17.071
Please, sir!

39:18.698 --> 39:20.574
I surrender!

39:21.326 --> 39:24.703
Excuse me, sir.
My name is James Graham. I'm British.

39:24.871 --> 39:26.413
I'd like to surrender, please!

39:29.501 --> 39:31.001
Please!

39:31.503 --> 39:32.920
Please, I'm British.

39:33.129 --> 39:35.381
I'd like to surrender.
Please, sir.

39:36.216 --> 39:37.800
Please!

39:41.429 --> 39:42.513
English boy!

40:33.023 --> 40:35.316
I surrender!

40:35.901 --> 40:37.276
Please!

40:51.499 --> 40:53.667
Help me!

40:54.252 --> 40:56.337
Help me! I'm British!

40:56.838 --> 40:58.672
Help me!

40:59.424 --> 41:01.383
- Help me!
- Stop running.

41:24.741 --> 41:27.910
Please! No! Please!

41:34.042 --> 41:37.002
Help me! Help me!

41:59.484 --> 42:00.609
Hello.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.614
Kid. Kid, you okay?

42:11.579 --> 42:13.080
Kid, you all right?

42:14.541 --> 42:16.250
I think so.

42:16.584 --> 42:19.086
Where do you live?

42:19.379 --> 42:21.296
13 Amherst Avenue.

42:21.506 --> 42:24.883
I'm waiting for my parents.
They've been delayed.

42:25.093 --> 42:28.929
Delayed?
Some kind of crazy British kid.

42:30.432 --> 42:31.849
What's your name?

42:32.183 --> 42:35.811
James Graham.
I'm writing a book on contract bridge.

42:37.772 --> 42:39.940
Are you with the American fleet?

42:40.150 --> 42:43.986
American fleet? It looks like
you almost lost your shirt.

42:46.865 --> 42:50.075
Maybe I can help you find
your parents.

42:51.369 --> 42:52.745
I know just the man.

42:53.413 --> 42:56.040
Do you know General Winter?

42:56.249 --> 43:00.127
My father knows important people.
Do you know my father?

43:00.336 --> 43:03.422
He owns a textile mill
on Szechwan Road.

43:03.631 --> 43:07.634
Mr. Lockwood? He's with
the British Association.

43:07.844 --> 43:09.344
Perhaps you don't know anyone.

43:09.554 --> 43:13.640
How about Louis Charles and Michael
of the Avenue Foch gang?

43:13.892 --> 43:16.435
Know about psychic bidding?
It's in my book.

43:16.644 --> 43:18.896
Let's say you need three diamonds.

43:19.105 --> 43:20.898
You just think three diamonds.

43:21.107 --> 43:24.443
Then your partner,
when he gets four aces...

43:24.652 --> 43:27.488
...he shouts and you put down the....

43:27.697 --> 43:30.449
You put down your aces and then....

43:30.658 --> 43:32.451
I can't remember it now.

43:33.203 --> 43:36.955
Probably my parents are on a ship
to Hong Kong.

43:37.165 --> 43:38.916
Then they'll send for me.

43:39.167 --> 43:41.043
My father will give you a reward.

43:41.252 --> 43:45.172
He gave a taxi driver $5
for bringing me home from Hankow.

43:45.381 --> 43:46.840
Ever been to England?

43:47.050 --> 43:49.468
Kid, you're starting to get
on my nerves.

44:09.197 --> 44:12.449
Look what I found under my truck.
I'm sorry already.

44:12.659 --> 44:13.992
Come on in, boy.

44:14.202 --> 44:16.620
He's either hungry or crazy.

44:16.830 --> 44:19.248
You need to lie down?

44:20.250 --> 44:22.668
My father has a cotton mill at...

44:22.877 --> 44:24.294
...Pootung.

44:25.588 --> 44:30.217
- He'll be ingratiated to you.
- Ingratiated is a fine word.

44:30.969 --> 44:32.010
He once gave a taxi--

44:32.220 --> 44:36.265
In a minute.
Your tongue's running away.

44:39.561 --> 44:42.146
That's a well-kept set of teeth.

44:42.689 --> 44:46.400
Someone has paid a lot of bills
for that sweet mouth.

44:46.651 --> 44:50.737
Frank, you'd be surprised how
people neglect their kids' teeth.

44:50.947 --> 44:52.781
Basie, I got you three.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.993
I wasn't able to sell
any goddamn portholes.

44:56.202 --> 44:58.203
Those Hankow merchants...

44:58.413 --> 45:01.248
...they're charging $10
for a bag of rice.

45:03.626 --> 45:05.169
Cathedral School too.

45:06.671 --> 45:07.921
Cathedral?

45:09.465 --> 45:11.758
Is he a kind of priest?

45:12.635 --> 45:14.887
The Cathedral School.

45:16.556 --> 45:18.932
It's a school for taipans.

45:25.607 --> 45:28.442
You must know some
important people, son.

45:28.776 --> 45:30.444
What do they call you?

45:30.987 --> 45:33.488
I once met Madame Sun Yat-Sen.

45:33.948 --> 45:36.491
She didn't call me anything.
I was only three and a half.

45:36.701 --> 45:38.327
Madame Sun?

45:38.536 --> 45:39.828
I was presented.

45:40.788 --> 45:44.958
- Presented.
- You two keep getting presented.

45:45.168 --> 45:49.421
We'll be up to our asses in junk,
eating rats when the Japs walk in.

45:49.631 --> 45:51.840
The Japs are not looking for us.

45:52.050 --> 45:55.427
Nantao Creek is full of cholera.
They've got more sense.

45:55.637 --> 45:58.972
It's a changed world.
Even if I sell this stuff...

45:59.182 --> 46:02.226
...there wouldn't be enough to get
a sampan upriver.

46:02.435 --> 46:07.314
We'd have to strip the Queen Mary!
So we don't have any rice for you.

46:08.858 --> 46:11.026
Let's leave the boy alone.

46:13.279 --> 46:16.657
All these new words and now this.
Fancy candy?

46:35.301 --> 46:38.512
- What did you say your name was?
- Jamie.

46:39.639 --> 46:43.058
I'm building a man-flying kite...

46:43.559 --> 46:46.228
...and writing a book
on contract bridge.

46:46.437 --> 46:50.440
Jim. A new name for a new life.

46:51.276 --> 46:54.903
Jim's parents got
taken with the other Brits...

46:55.113 --> 46:57.572
...and now Jim's looking for them.

47:36.321 --> 47:41.199
Don't worry about Frank, he always
eats after me. Don't you, Frank?

47:41.617 --> 47:43.910
I always eat after you, Basie.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.913
Because I think for us both.

47:47.123 --> 47:48.957
Jim, chew your food.

47:49.250 --> 47:53.128
Chew every mouthful six times
to get the benefit.

48:09.604 --> 48:13.482
Frank, we might do all right
in one of those camps.

48:14.650 --> 48:18.320
Doesn't look like we'll
leave Shanghai soon.

48:26.537 --> 48:29.122
You're a tired boy, Jim.

48:36.964 --> 48:39.174
Where am I gonna sleep?

48:39.842 --> 48:41.760
Shanghai Jim.

48:43.471 --> 48:45.806
Find any gold teeth?

48:46.766 --> 48:50.519
Buying and selling, Frank. You know.

48:52.355 --> 48:53.563
Life.

49:11.374 --> 49:13.333
Okay, sit. Sit.

49:23.010 --> 49:24.344
Make a muscle.

49:41.070 --> 49:43.572
- Why can't he sell me?
- Nobody wants you.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.866
You're worth nothing.
Skin and bone.

49:46.075 --> 49:48.743
Pretty soon, you'll be sick
all the time.

50:22.612 --> 50:23.987
Basie....

50:26.657 --> 50:29.409
First, I could show you
some rich pickings.

50:30.620 --> 50:33.079
Hundreds of houses left empty.

50:33.623 --> 50:34.664
Is that right?

50:35.082 --> 50:39.085
I'll show you the houses
I lived in before Frank found me.

50:41.464 --> 50:43.131
They were luxuriant!

50:44.258 --> 50:45.884
Luxuriant?

50:46.511 --> 50:50.263
You had good sense being born there.
It was good living.

50:50.765 --> 50:53.350
There certainly was good living!

50:57.188 --> 50:59.773
There was opulence!

51:01.943 --> 51:03.485
Opulence.

51:06.239 --> 51:07.364
All right.

51:07.990 --> 51:11.034
We'll go look at these houses.

51:14.455 --> 51:16.122
Let's go, Frank.

51:17.625 --> 51:18.667
Opulence.

51:49.156 --> 51:52.951
That one has whiskey, gin
and a white piano.

51:53.869 --> 51:57.163
That one has whiskey, gin....

51:57.373 --> 52:00.709
- Whiskey and a radiogram.
- What about the boarded one?

52:01.460 --> 52:05.213
It has a mirrored dance floor,
radiogram, fountain...

52:05.590 --> 52:09.050
- ...and crystal chandeliers.
- Crystal chandeliers?

52:09.635 --> 52:12.178
- I think they were crystal.
- You're tired.

52:12.430 --> 52:13.471
What about cash?

52:13.973 --> 52:17.726
- What about money?
- I did see money.

52:17.977 --> 52:21.563
Piles of notes on the table.
I'm taking you there.

52:22.231 --> 52:23.398
Turn right here.

52:54.513 --> 52:56.348
I knew she'd come back.

52:58.809 --> 53:00.435
Take it easy.

53:01.979 --> 53:03.647
Mother!

53:23.042 --> 53:25.794
- Damn it, they're Japs.
- I see. Back out.

53:26.003 --> 53:28.630
I can't back out! There's no reverse!

53:28.839 --> 53:30.507
- Just go forward.
- Come on!

53:40.726 --> 53:43.311
Jesus Christ, Frank.

53:54.156 --> 53:56.908
I want these back when they're done.

54:07.628 --> 54:09.421
Basie....

54:10.506 --> 54:20.932
Basie.

54:27.732 --> 54:30.316
Engine number two on fire.
On fire, come in.

54:30.526 --> 54:33.611
Come in, Red Dog Leader.
Red Dog Leader, come in.

54:33.821 --> 54:36.865
Adjusting propeller? Red Dog Leader.

54:37.074 --> 54:41.369
Engine two on fire.
On fire, on fire, on fire....

54:41.579 --> 54:46.249
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen

54:46.459 --> 54:50.628
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even

54:51.839 --> 54:55.425
It's just a little fever.
Don't worry. We've all had it.

54:55.634 --> 54:57.427
Do you feel better now?

55:57.613 --> 56:00.323
It's perfectly all right.
I can wash it.

56:10.501 --> 56:12.585
Excuse me.

56:13.629 --> 56:15.421
There's been a mistake.

56:16.131 --> 56:18.299
It may have been my fault.
I'm terribly sorry.

56:36.694 --> 56:40.822
Attention, prisoners!
For camp transport, assemble outside.

56:41.031 --> 56:45.076
Outside. Make one line.
Number one prisoner group to gate.

56:45.286 --> 56:47.829
Prisoners, number one truck.

57:11.437 --> 57:13.730
Have you forgotten the cutlery?

57:13.939 --> 57:15.648
No, I haven't.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.657
Basie.

57:25.701 --> 57:27.160
Basie.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.495
No.

57:30.331 --> 57:34.959
You can't drink water from here.
People are dying of dysentery.

57:35.878 --> 57:37.837
But we can drink boiled water.

57:38.756 --> 57:40.381
Boiled water?

57:41.884 --> 57:42.967
Many thanks, Basie.

57:43.385 --> 57:45.011
You're welcome, Jim.

57:45.220 --> 57:48.014
You've got nice manners.
I appreciate that.

57:49.725 --> 57:52.185
Now it's chow time.
Get in line.

57:52.645 --> 57:55.688
Keep the ball in play,
first in line.

57:55.898 --> 57:58.024
I think your father would agree.

57:58.359 --> 58:00.234
Actually, he would agree.

58:00.444 --> 58:03.279
After the war, you two
should play tennis.

58:06.075 --> 58:10.453
I want you to get Mrs. Partridge's
potato while you're there.

58:11.914 --> 58:13.748
I think she died, Basie.

58:13.958 --> 58:17.377
She died, but didn't hand
in her dinner pail.

58:18.212 --> 58:21.339
Okay, go. Go on. Hurry.

58:25.219 --> 58:29.222
And, Ace, don't forget to bow
to the sergeant.

58:33.519 --> 58:35.603
We gotta get out of here.

58:38.899 --> 58:43.820
The camps are full. It's our
bad luck to be taken here.

58:50.869 --> 58:53.997
The Japs haven't enough camps
for us all.

59:03.257 --> 59:06.676
This is disgusting. Get some water.

59:16.145 --> 59:17.812
Come on, children.

59:20.441 --> 59:22.316
She's with God now.

01:00:07.988 --> 01:00:09.781
What are you doing, Basie?

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.244
Looks like your size, Jim.

01:00:17.456 --> 01:00:18.998
I don't want her shoes.

01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:21.876
I don't want them.

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:26.297
- I don't want them.
- Somebody will.

01:00:26.507 --> 01:00:28.424
Basie, leave her!

01:00:28.634 --> 01:00:30.676
Fine! I don't want her shoes!

01:00:30.886 --> 01:00:33.513
Stop it. Leave her. Leave her!

01:00:33.722 --> 01:00:36.682
Stop it. I don't want her shoes!

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:38.601
Pipe down.

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.235
It's the lorry. The lorry!

01:00:47.402 --> 01:00:48.611
The lorry!

01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:50.446
Come on!

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:52.990
- Come on.
- No!

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.245
Come on! Don't you see?
This place is to see who dies!

01:01:00.249 --> 01:01:03.334
Healthy ones go. Sick stay.

01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:06.546
Tell him who we are, then--

01:01:06.755 --> 01:01:10.591
We don't say anything.
Just look him in the eye.

01:01:21.728 --> 01:01:23.271
- Name?
- George Flynn.

01:01:24.064 --> 01:01:25.523
- Name?
- Summers.

01:01:36.702 --> 01:01:37.743
Excuse me.

01:01:38.078 --> 01:01:42.665
- I'm a doctor. Let me through.
- That's not fair!

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:45.585
I'm a British citizen!

01:01:46.128 --> 01:01:47.837
You can't do this!

01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:06.022
No! I'm with them!

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:10.484
- Please!
- Please!

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:28.211
Paul. Your name Paul?

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:33.424
Get your sister to smile,
I'll show you a magic trick.

01:02:34.635 --> 01:02:38.179
Don't leave me!
Take me with you, Basie!

01:02:40.015 --> 01:02:41.599
Listen!

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:46.687
Listen, Basie! Take me with you!
I can't stay here!

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.484
I'll work for you. I'll do anything!
Take me with you!

01:02:51.652 --> 01:02:53.694
Basie! Basie!

01:03:13.298 --> 01:03:15.174
- Soochow.
- Soochow!

01:03:15.842 --> 01:03:19.345
I've been there lots of times.
Straight in that direction!

01:03:19.554 --> 01:03:22.181
Head straight in that direction.

01:03:23.058 --> 01:03:28.229
My parents were members of the country
club. Straight that way.

01:03:29.398 --> 01:03:33.985
I've lived here my whole life!
I know my way everywhere.

01:03:34.194 --> 01:03:35.236
I can speak--

01:03:39.032 --> 01:03:40.783
Soochow!

01:03:40.993 --> 01:03:43.244
Here we go!

01:03:46.039 --> 01:03:48.666
Soochow!

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:14.650
Nice pair of golf shoes.

01:04:15.444 --> 01:04:17.486
A friend left them to me.

01:04:17.779 --> 01:04:20.281
You wouldn't want
a watch, would you?

01:04:20.782 --> 01:04:23.075
No. Sorry.

01:04:24.786 --> 01:04:28.539
Now do you know where we are?
We're here, okay?

01:04:28.749 --> 01:04:33.210
We have to turn left here.
We have to turn left, okay?

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.757
You do what I say or we'll never get
to Soochow.

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:40.134
And then you'll be shot.

01:04:42.387 --> 01:04:44.805
I look after him for his daddy.

01:04:45.724 --> 01:04:49.101
- You're American, are you?
- Definitely.

01:04:50.479 --> 01:04:53.898
I worked underground
for the Kuomintang.

01:04:54.775 --> 01:04:56.609
As a conjurer?

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:18.798
That must be the camp.
We'll live right by the airfield.

01:05:19.007 --> 01:05:22.468
- I don't see a camp.
- Over there. See?

01:05:22.677 --> 01:05:25.221
Those huts at a distance.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:54.417
What do I do with this?

01:05:58.547 --> 01:06:01.507
They want us to carry stones!

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.596
Please, on the truck is
a sick old man. Please....

01:06:08.473 --> 01:06:11.183
On the truck, there's an old man.

01:06:11.393 --> 01:06:14.645
- No, no, no.
- Please!

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:21.569
Papa! Papa!

01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:24.530
I'm all right.

01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:18.222
- Use your wedge!
- That boy, running wild!

01:10:18.431 --> 01:10:21.016
Spends most of his time
at the 19th hole.

01:10:21.226 --> 01:10:24.770
You'll be blackballed by
the country club, Jim.

01:10:38.785 --> 01:10:40.452
Hello, Jim.

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:52.131
That's a splendid cabbage. Thanks.

01:11:12.986 --> 01:11:15.112
Now number seven for the sketch.

01:11:15.321 --> 01:11:19.783
"Fare thee well: 'tis partly my
own fault which death or absence--"

01:11:19.993 --> 01:11:22.035
"Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse."

01:12:07.373 --> 01:12:11.084
That's not fair!
Give us our marbles back.

01:12:13.505 --> 01:12:17.549
Give us our marbles back!
At least one more chance.

01:12:18.259 --> 01:12:20.052
Mrs. Phillips!

01:12:20.553 --> 01:12:22.179
Mrs. Gilmour!

01:12:25.058 --> 01:12:28.101
Dr. Rawlins, I've got my homework.

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.274
Can you do this?

01:12:38.613 --> 01:12:42.574
Now don't speed up.
Keep the rhythm.

01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:53.585
She's gone, Dr. Rawlins.

01:13:15.316 --> 01:13:19.736
She just looked at me. She looked
at me! I've done it!

01:13:19.946 --> 01:13:22.281
I can bring her back to life!

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:26.076
Watch her eyes. I can do it again!

01:13:26.286 --> 01:13:29.246
She thought she was dying in England.

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:31.999
Stop it, Jim!

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:42.676
You pumped some blood into her brain,
just for a moment.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:53.812
Give the mosquito net to Mr. Radik.
Just give it to him.

01:13:54.022 --> 01:13:57.608
You give the mosquito net
to whoever's dying next?

01:14:35.063 --> 01:14:38.565
Future passive. "I shall be loved."

01:14:39.651 --> 01:14:42.694
Amabor. It's like
losing the war, dying.

01:14:42.904 --> 01:14:45.238
"They were being loved."

01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.866
Amabantur. Can I have his shoes
when he's dead?

01:14:48.034 --> 01:14:49.576
You pragmatist.

01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:53.038
- "You will have been loved."
- Amatus eris.

01:14:53.247 --> 01:14:54.873
We have to beat them.

01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:57.501
- Who?
- The Japanese.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:15:00.796
It's how we'll win, refusing to die.

01:15:01.047 --> 01:15:04.841
- What happens when war ends?
- Do you want it to end?

01:15:05.051 --> 01:15:08.553
If we stay in the camps,
the Japanese will look after us.

01:15:08.846 --> 01:15:13.684
We're an embarrassment to them.
They can't feed us much longer.

01:15:13.893 --> 01:15:15.936
They'll fight the Americans.

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:18.522
- You admire the Japanese?
- They're brave.

01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:21.608
- That's important?
- If you want to win a war.

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:23.944
We don't want them to win.

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:26.905
I know.

01:15:27.532 --> 01:15:29.825
Remember, we're British.

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:31.535
Yes.

01:15:31.911 --> 01:15:33.704
I've never been there.

01:15:35.081 --> 01:15:36.707
Put that down.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:40.168
Tomorrow, gerunds.
What about English?

01:15:42.213 --> 01:15:45.173
Think of it as the antidote.

01:15:45.425 --> 01:15:47.718
We are never sure of sorrow
Joy was never sure

01:15:47.927 --> 01:15:50.637
Today will die, tomorrow
Time stoops to no man's lure

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.472
With love grown--

01:15:52.724 --> 01:15:55.976
Learn it as a poem.
It's not just a string of words.

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:59.980
- Would you look at Mr. Radik?
- Yes, of course.

01:16:00.773 --> 01:16:03.358
Those from the hospital garden?

01:16:03.568 --> 01:16:05.652
I have to give Basie something--

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:08.447
Good thing you're friends.
He's a survivor.

01:16:08.656 --> 01:16:11.324
Because he only drinks boiled water.

01:16:11.993 --> 01:16:15.495
You'll wear yourself out looking
after everyone.

01:16:17.415 --> 01:16:20.000
Keeps himself busy, doesn't he?

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:25.881
Young Jim.

01:16:26.299 --> 01:16:29.551
- The caterers are arriving.
- I'll be there!

01:16:29.761 --> 01:16:31.970
Won't taste the same without you.

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:43.148
Wait for me!

01:17:05.171 --> 01:17:07.672
- What about mines?
- Get out.

01:17:07.882 --> 01:17:13.178
- Maybe the Japs put down mines.
- Hey, boss. Boss!

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:17.099
- Boss, it's the kid.
- Come in.

01:17:22.647 --> 01:17:25.941
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Please!

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:28.610
So would I. Have you got one?

01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:37.744
Stop breathing so much.
There ain't enough air.

01:17:37.995 --> 01:17:40.705
There isn't enough air for you
in China.

01:17:40.915 --> 01:17:44.501
- Here are your clothes.
- Better than the Shanghai laundry.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:46.878
- Did you get a cork?
- I got one.

01:17:47.088 --> 01:17:48.421
Good boy.

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:52.801
- That's fine.
- I've never seen that one. What year?

01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:56.012
- '45.
- '45? How'd you get that?

01:17:56.222 --> 01:18:01.017
I subscribe. It has Packard,
Studebaker, Jell-O. Things from home.

01:18:01.227 --> 01:18:04.312
- Can you get me a sewing needle?
- I'll try.

01:18:04.522 --> 01:18:07.482
- What's that?
- It's a trap.

01:18:07.692 --> 01:18:09.568
Get out of here.

01:18:09.777 --> 01:18:13.738
It's all right. You're almost one of
us. You see that Mustang?

01:18:13.948 --> 01:18:18.827
- It's the Cadillac of the sky.
- That's right. B-29s too.

01:18:19.036 --> 01:18:20.287
B-29s?

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:23.456
The Super fortress.
A hemisphere defense weapon.

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:24.708
Where from?

01:18:24.876 --> 01:18:28.503
Okinawa. Philippines. Tokyo's in
bombing range now.

01:18:28.713 --> 01:18:31.548
- Tokyo?
- Time to think of going home soon.

01:18:31.757 --> 01:18:33.758
We'll have to leave the camp?

01:18:33.968 --> 01:18:36.344
One side feeds you,
the other tries to kill you.

01:18:36.554 --> 01:18:38.597
It's turned around. It's all timing.

01:18:38.806 --> 01:18:43.435
- Tell me when it's time? Promise?
- Promise.

01:18:43.686 --> 01:18:45.562
It'd be simpler to live here.

01:18:45.771 --> 01:18:49.149
You've the British dorm to go to
when they're sick of you.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:51.067
They are sick of me.

01:18:51.277 --> 01:18:55.280
The British dorm's so lethargic.
Will you let me?

01:18:55.489 --> 01:18:59.492
This'll be the place on Thanksgiving.
I'll have pheasant.

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:00.702
Pheasant?

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:02.746
Just made the traps.
Works like a noose.

01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:07.083
Stick out your arm. Neat.

01:19:07.293 --> 01:19:09.252
I've seen no pheasants, have you?

01:19:09.462 --> 01:19:11.713
- Outside the wire.
- Which wire?

01:19:11.923 --> 01:19:14.216
- Our wire.
- That close?

01:19:14.425 --> 01:19:18.094
At the edge of the airfield,
across the canal.

01:19:18.304 --> 01:19:21.973
An American initiative.
Whoever delivers gets the gravy.

01:19:22.183 --> 01:19:24.768
How's your friend, Dr. Schweitzer?

01:19:24.977 --> 01:19:27.938
I brought Amy Matthews
back to life for a minute.

01:19:28.147 --> 01:19:33.026
That's worth a Reader's Digest.
Increase your word power.

01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:37.489
- I got a new one today: pragmatist.
- Good word.

01:19:38.824 --> 01:19:41.868
If I set the traps, could I live here?

01:19:42.119 --> 01:19:45.038
- It's a consideration.
- Take me with you?

01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:49.834
Frankly, it's a tossup now between
you and Dainty.

01:19:50.044 --> 01:19:51.169
Take me!

01:19:51.837 --> 01:19:54.381
Give me a good reason I should.

01:19:55.383 --> 01:19:57.259
I'm your friend.

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:05.183
- Chow truck's here.
- Mr. Maxton keeps my place.

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:27.872
They cut the bloody rations!

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:34.170
- Don't worry. I'll get yours.
- You're just like your father.

01:20:40.594 --> 01:20:43.054
They cut our rations in half!

01:20:44.098 --> 01:20:46.850
I'll get ours. You sit down.

01:20:50.813 --> 01:20:54.357
You cut the bloody rations!
You cut them!

01:21:25.765 --> 01:21:27.640
Mr. Maxton.

01:21:28.017 --> 01:21:31.019
I've got yours, Mr. Maxton.

01:21:36.317 --> 01:21:38.610
I've got some! I've got some!

01:21:39.153 --> 01:21:40.820
Hello, everybody.

01:22:11.644 --> 01:22:14.646
- Sit there.
- Eat, please.

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:21.903
The rations have been cut.
They're like animals.

01:22:22.113 --> 01:22:26.157
82, 83, 84....

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:27.700
Sorry.

01:22:28.452 --> 01:22:31.621
87 weevils today, Mr. Victor.

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:37.710
Above average, but the trend is down.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:51.516
- Must you, Jim?
- Sorry.

01:22:51.851 --> 01:22:56.521
Some of us will die just before we're
saved, so use everything.

01:22:56.856 --> 01:23:00.817
- You'll miss this camp after the war.
- Will I?

01:23:01.861 --> 01:23:05.155
I'll locate my parents when the people
in the camps come out.

01:23:05.364 --> 01:23:10.326
- I'll tell my dad you looked after me.
- Think I'll get the reward?

01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:14.914
- What reward?
- You told everyone.

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:17.584
I was much younger then.

01:23:18.711 --> 01:23:21.087
Why'd the Japanese close the school?

01:23:21.755 --> 01:23:24.632
To punish the grownups.

01:23:27.553 --> 01:23:30.430
I wonder how you'll take to school
in England.

01:23:31.015 --> 01:23:33.308
It might be strange.

01:23:33.893 --> 01:23:37.270
The best teacher's
the university of life.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.646
For heaven's--

01:23:38.856 --> 01:23:43.943
Could we finish our meal? We know
your views on the university of life.

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:50.158
- We should eat the weevils.
- I know. Dr. Rawlins told you.

01:23:50.367 --> 01:23:54.621
- He said we need the protein.
- Yes, he's right.

01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:57.248
We should all eat the weevils.

01:23:58.042 --> 01:24:00.668
Do you believe in vitamins?

01:24:01.795 --> 01:24:04.297
Strange child.

01:24:08.761 --> 01:24:13.056
Perhaps it's time you moved
into the men's dormitory.

01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:15.391
You're not 12 anymore.

01:25:00.437 --> 01:25:03.189
The Americans are over Nantao again.

01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:40.745
They're bombing the Shanghai docks!

01:26:56.428 --> 01:26:57.929
Coney Island pilots.

01:26:58.138 --> 01:27:00.556
- What was that?
- A 29 going down.

01:27:00.766 --> 01:27:02.934
- A 200-pounder.
- That was close.

01:27:03.143 --> 01:27:06.145
- Too close for Nagata.
- He won't like that.

01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:22.912
What's happening, doctor?

01:27:23.122 --> 01:27:26.999
Reprisals, and damned silly it is too.

01:27:30.379 --> 01:27:34.632
- Keep the patients from the windows.
- Yes, doctor.

01:30:21.884 --> 01:30:23.009
Hey!

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:27.096
Get away! This is British food!
Leave it alone!

01:30:27.306 --> 01:30:29.348
It's our food. Get away!

01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:33.477
Guards!

01:30:46.325 --> 01:30:50.161
Mines. That was a mine. I told you.

01:30:51.163 --> 01:30:53.748
Somebody lobbed a grenade.

01:31:13.769 --> 01:31:17.605
Say, Basie, I bet he hits a mine.

01:31:17.814 --> 01:31:21.776
I bet you there are no mines.
You can walk right through.

01:31:21.985 --> 01:31:23.110
You got a bet.

01:32:02.567 --> 01:32:05.111
So far, so good.

01:33:43.168 --> 01:33:45.252
He's seen something.

01:33:46.755 --> 01:33:48.380
Jim's a black cat.

01:34:32.676 --> 01:34:36.846
That's a dead boy, Basie.
I'll give you odds.

01:34:37.055 --> 01:34:38.848
My harmonica...

01:34:39.558 --> 01:34:43.102
...and my next meal
against your wristwatch.

01:34:45.522 --> 01:34:47.189
You're on, my friend.

01:35:03.582 --> 01:35:06.458
I double my bet.
My next two meals.

01:35:06.668 --> 01:35:10.921
- You'll lose a lot of weight.
- What else you betting?

01:35:11.173 --> 01:35:13.132
- My Life.
- Who's on the cover?

01:35:21.183 --> 01:35:24.810
- Two cigarettes on Jim!
- Sunglasses on Nagata!

01:35:35.197 --> 01:35:37.156
Keep going, sarge!

01:36:27.415 --> 01:36:30.709
- The lucky kid.
- Cleaned me out.

01:37:09.416 --> 01:37:12.084
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Nina.

01:37:12.294 --> 01:37:14.753
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Yes.

01:37:14.963 --> 01:37:17.631
So would I, kid. You got one?

01:38:39.881 --> 01:38:44.468
Don't let me down, kid.
You're an American now.

01:38:52.852 --> 01:38:56.397
How you doing, Frank?

01:39:55.123 --> 01:39:59.710
The river's east. You can go
up the bank or up the middle...

01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:03.755
...or go north of east,
but you gotta go across canals.

01:40:04.007 --> 01:40:06.675
Don't know if it's buildings or what.

01:40:06.885 --> 01:40:08.886
Where'd you get a map?

01:40:12.015 --> 01:40:14.016
A cork and needle?

01:40:14.225 --> 01:40:17.936
- A compass that actually works.
- Put it down.

01:40:18.146 --> 01:40:20.814
- Is it time?
- No, I'll tell you when.

01:40:21.024 --> 01:40:23.650
- You won't forget?
- Fat chance.

01:40:23.902 --> 01:40:28.238
- I almost feel human.
- Without me, you'd have no compass.

01:40:28.448 --> 01:40:31.617
No, without you
I wouldn't have the needle.

01:40:31.826 --> 01:40:34.161
The best way is across the river.

01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:35.704
Nagata!

01:40:35.914 --> 01:40:37.915
Jim, the curtain.

01:42:38.202 --> 01:42:40.078
Jim, come here.

01:42:42.624 --> 01:42:44.916
You're in charge of my stuff.

01:43:30.213 --> 01:43:32.881
You see this mosquito net?

01:43:35.551 --> 01:43:37.135
See?

01:43:37.595 --> 01:43:39.429
What's it tell you?

01:43:45.353 --> 01:43:47.771
Rawlins is on the take.

01:43:50.692 --> 01:43:53.527
- You're so clever, Basie.
- Yeah.

01:43:54.946 --> 01:43:57.656
Only cost me two batteries.

01:43:58.991 --> 01:44:00.909
How are you feeling?

01:44:01.369 --> 01:44:02.953
I've had worse.

01:44:03.162 --> 01:44:05.622
I was beaten by a stoker once.

01:44:06.249 --> 01:44:08.125
Were you a stoker?

01:44:08.501 --> 01:44:12.587
Ship's steward.
Shanghai-Frisco line.

01:44:13.464 --> 01:44:15.507
Why did he beat you?

01:44:20.138 --> 01:44:24.391
Shanghai-Frisco will be
the trip now. Huh, Jim?

01:44:25.893 --> 01:44:29.020
Basie, where do you live?

01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:30.480
Here.

01:44:30.732 --> 01:44:33.358
No, I mean after the war.

01:44:33.568 --> 01:44:35.360
Somewhere else.

01:44:40.616 --> 01:44:45.203
Until you find a place,
you could live at Amherst Avenue.

01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:52.711
I'd like you to come
and meet my parents.

01:44:55.673 --> 01:44:58.091
We could fill up the pool...

01:44:59.302 --> 01:45:01.720
...and we'll eat three times a day.

01:45:04.849 --> 01:45:07.809
You're not feeling
sorry for me, are you?

01:45:08.019 --> 01:45:11.980
- No one feels sorry for you, Basie.
- That's right.

01:45:12.523 --> 01:45:16.985
- And you always eat first.
- You said it, kid.

01:45:18.529 --> 01:45:21.656
I've been thinking about
going upriver.

01:45:21.866 --> 01:45:23.533
I know.

01:45:24.994 --> 01:45:26.620
Listen--

01:45:26.829 --> 01:45:31.583
The plan is,
we're going to get a sampan.

01:45:31.793 --> 01:45:36.963
Take it up the Yangtze estuary.
Rendezvous with some Hakka friends.

01:45:37.173 --> 01:45:39.633
Are they proper pirates, you mean?

01:45:39.884 --> 01:45:43.845
Let's just call them gentlemen
of fortune, shall we?

01:45:47.475 --> 01:45:49.226
Did you ever see...

01:45:49.435 --> 01:45:53.855
- ...the Hell Drivers in Shanghai?
- Yes. On the newsreels.

01:45:54.065 --> 01:45:56.691
I saw them crash
through a burning wall.

01:45:56.901 --> 01:46:00.946
That's what I'm going to call
our little outfit.

01:46:01.155 --> 01:46:03.031
With 250 calibers...

01:46:03.241 --> 01:46:06.701
...we are going to be
the lords of the Yangtze.

01:46:06.953 --> 01:46:09.746
Actually, that may be a better name.

01:46:09.997 --> 01:46:14.459
It's at the beginning and end of war
that we have to watch out.

01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:18.129
In between, it's like a country club.

01:46:18.381 --> 01:46:23.385
But you gotta know how to stay
balanced and make the right friends.

01:46:23.636 --> 01:46:27.556
Because this war
is definitely winding down.

01:46:27.807 --> 01:46:29.391
And after that?

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.560
After that...

01:46:31.769 --> 01:46:36.147
...I retire in luxury,
start a barber college....

01:46:47.743 --> 01:46:49.828
What are you doing here?

01:46:58.004 --> 01:47:01.006
I told you to look out for my stuff.

01:47:06.345 --> 01:47:08.471
They were bigger than me.

01:47:31.495 --> 01:47:35.373
- Look who's here.
- So you were under the net?

01:47:36.125 --> 01:47:38.293
Cleaned up your room.

01:52:45.809 --> 01:52:47.393
Stay with me, darling!

01:53:00.658 --> 01:53:05.286
- Everybody inside, quick!
- Away from the buildings!

01:53:07.831 --> 01:53:09.874
Oh, God. Please, no!

01:53:10.167 --> 01:53:12.126
My husband's in there!

01:54:12.938 --> 01:54:18.526
Go! P-51, Cadillac of the sky!

01:54:23.657 --> 01:54:28.494
P-51, Cadillac of the sky!

01:54:35.919 --> 01:54:37.086
Jim?

01:54:39.882 --> 01:54:42.884
Jim, get off the roof!

01:54:43.052 --> 01:54:44.677
Jim!

01:54:46.722 --> 01:54:49.390
Horsepower!

01:55:04.406 --> 01:55:07.950
Get down, Jim. Go on, get down!

01:55:09.328 --> 01:55:12.538
P-51! Aren't they beautiful?

01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:15.708
- Get down!
- I touched them!

01:55:15.918 --> 01:55:20.463
I felt their heat! I can taste them.
Oil and cordite.

01:55:20.672 --> 01:55:22.799
Come back to the hospital.

01:55:23.008 --> 01:55:26.219
Remember how we helped
to build the runway?

01:55:26.428 --> 01:55:31.432
If we'd died like the others,
our bones would be in the runway.

01:55:31.642 --> 01:55:36.396
- In a way, it's our runway.
- No, it's their runway, Jim.

01:55:36.605 --> 01:55:38.398
Try not to think so much.

01:55:38.857 --> 01:55:41.609
Try not to think so much!

01:55:51.245 --> 01:55:54.455
I can't remember
what my parents look like.

01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:03.297
I used to play bridge
with my mother in her bedroom.

01:56:04.883 --> 01:56:08.886
She used to comb her hair.
I'd watch her.

01:56:09.721 --> 01:56:13.057
She had dark hair.

01:59:11.653 --> 01:59:13.863
What's happening?

01:59:17.701 --> 01:59:20.202
The guards are leaving!
They're taking us upcountry.

01:59:20.412 --> 01:59:23.164
They're moving us to Nantao!
There's food there.

01:59:23.373 --> 01:59:28.044
One suitcase!
We leave in one hour! One suitcase!

01:59:28.253 --> 01:59:29.545
One suitcase!

01:59:30.130 --> 01:59:32.590
Our rations are at Nantao.

01:59:40.807 --> 01:59:42.308
He's gone.

01:59:43.852 --> 01:59:45.436
Him and Dainty.

01:59:49.149 --> 01:59:50.608
He's gone?

01:59:52.361 --> 01:59:53.944
He's escaped?

01:59:56.198 --> 01:59:58.616
He can't have. He promised me!

02:00:04.998 --> 02:00:06.916
He knew it was time.

02:00:08.043 --> 02:00:11.712
- Where am I gonna go?
- We'll all have to leave now.

02:00:13.548 --> 02:00:18.552
He knew it was time.

02:00:36.988 --> 02:00:38.114
Boy.

02:00:40.992 --> 02:00:43.077
Difficult boy.

02:01:02.764 --> 02:01:04.306
Just look...

02:01:06.059 --> 02:01:08.728
...later here for escort!

02:04:00.442 --> 02:04:04.612
Jim, where's my husband?
Where's Mr. Victor?

02:07:15.845 --> 02:07:17.805
We are civilians. Listen to me.

02:07:18.014 --> 02:07:22.309
I am a British doctor.
They are my responsibility!

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:38.033
We must have rest and food.

02:07:38.368 --> 02:07:41.078
We're going upcountry, Jim.

02:07:42.872 --> 02:07:44.623
Will there be food there?

02:07:46.167 --> 02:07:48.252
There's none here.

02:07:53.383 --> 02:07:56.635
Mrs. Victor, we're going upcountry.

02:07:57.595 --> 02:08:02.474
Mrs. Victor.

02:08:03.393 --> 02:08:05.185
Come on, Jim.

02:08:08.982 --> 02:08:10.566
No.

02:08:10.775 --> 02:08:14.486
Don't go. It's better here.

02:08:19.075 --> 02:08:20.409
Jim!

02:08:20.618 --> 02:08:22.744
You'll die here.

02:08:24.581 --> 02:08:26.582
Don't worry, Mr. Maxton.

02:08:33.756 --> 02:08:37.342
Pretend you're dead, Mrs. Victor.

02:10:21.322 --> 02:10:23.573
Mrs. Victor.

02:10:30.915 --> 02:10:34.876
Surrender reached the
Japanese in a broadcast by Hirohito.

02:10:35.128 --> 02:10:39.506
He said Japan will endure the
unendurable and suffer greatly.

02:10:39.716 --> 02:10:44.720
The war minister and others
committed suicide outside the palace.

02:10:44.929 --> 02:10:48.724
Japan is devastated,
destroyed in spirit...

02:10:48.933 --> 02:10:51.768
...as Hiroshima and Nagasaki
have been destroyed.

02:10:51.978 --> 02:10:54.479
More than 100,000 people
were killed...

02:10:54.731 --> 02:10:58.817
...in two single-bomb explosions,
which ended the Pacific War.

02:10:59.068 --> 02:11:02.029
The Russian declaration of war...

02:11:02.238 --> 02:11:05.157
...has sent a million
soldiers into Manchuria.

02:11:05.408 --> 02:11:10.245
Tokyo was hit with a dawn-to-dusk
raid by 1500 B-29 bombers.

02:11:10.455 --> 02:11:14.041
But Japan's war was lost.
Her goal to create...

02:11:14.250 --> 02:11:17.252
...a new empire incinerated
in a flash...

02:11:17.462 --> 02:11:19.588
...hotter than the sun.

02:11:19.839 --> 02:11:23.300
Everyone stands in awe of
the new super-weapon.

02:11:23.509 --> 02:11:28.180
Only a few scientists knew the power
in splitting the uranium atom.

02:11:28.431 --> 02:11:31.016
It reached us in a shock wave...

02:11:31.225 --> 02:11:34.311
...and a white light: the atom bomb.

02:11:34.562 --> 02:11:36.438
Each of the two bombs...

02:11:36.647 --> 02:11:40.108
...had the power of
20,000 tons of explosives.

02:11:40.318 --> 02:11:43.403
Nagasaki is
Japan's gateway to China...

02:11:43.613 --> 02:11:46.698
...just 500 miles from Shanghai.

02:11:47.909 --> 02:11:52.204
I saw that! I saw it! I saw it!

02:11:54.665 --> 02:11:56.166
The white light.

02:11:57.919 --> 02:12:01.546
I thought it was Mrs. Victor's
soul going to heaven.

02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:45.645
Jim!

02:16:02.997 --> 02:16:05.457
Bastard!

02:16:20.056 --> 02:16:21.431
Jim!

02:16:29.065 --> 02:16:30.690
He gave me a mango.

02:16:31.525 --> 02:16:34.318
I'll give you
a whole fruit salad!

02:16:34.528 --> 02:16:38.031
There's Frigidaires
falling from the sky!

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:41.159
- He was my friend!
- He was a Jap!

02:16:41.369 --> 02:16:43.161
The war's over!

02:16:45.246 --> 02:16:49.084
You walked here from Nantao Stadium?

02:16:53.798 --> 02:16:57.634
What did you see? Rich pickings?

02:16:57.843 --> 02:17:00.428
Crystal chandeliers, cocktail bars...

02:17:00.638 --> 02:17:02.638
...white pianos?

02:17:09.563 --> 02:17:11.856
I learned a new word today.

02:17:14.276 --> 02:17:16.027
Atom bomb.

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:21.449
It was like a white light
in the sky.

02:17:23.994 --> 02:17:27.038
Like God taking a photograph.

02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:31.291
I saw it.

02:17:44.807 --> 02:17:52.313
I can bring everyone back.

02:17:54.233 --> 02:17:55.608
Everyone.

02:17:58.571 --> 02:18:00.864
I can bring everyone back.

02:18:02.616 --> 02:18:03.950
Everyone.

02:18:05.577 --> 02:18:07.870
I can bring everyone back.

02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:11.458
Everyone.

02:18:15.004 --> 02:18:17.922
I can bring everyone back.

02:18:19.424 --> 02:18:20.924
Everyone.

02:18:23.679 --> 02:18:26.138
I can bring everyone back.

02:18:28.726 --> 02:18:30.393
Everyone.

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:34.814
I can bring everyone back.

02:18:35.316 --> 02:18:36.691
Everyone.

02:18:36.859 --> 02:18:40.528
I can bring everyone back.

02:18:43.531 --> 02:18:46.159
- Everyone. Everyone.
- Jim!

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:52.373
- Didn't I teach you anything?
- Yes!

02:18:53.166 --> 02:18:54.459
Yeah.

02:18:55.335 --> 02:18:59.297
You taught me people will do
anything for a potato.

02:19:01.674 --> 02:19:03.550
Three years with him?

02:19:03.761 --> 02:19:07.138
Come on. I'll take you
back to your dad.

02:19:07.348 --> 02:19:11.934
We'll fill the pool
and eat three meals a day.

02:19:49.056 --> 02:19:51.808
Kid, you want a Hershey's bar?

02:19:52.643 --> 02:19:54.853
Yes, please, Basie.

02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:58.101
I surrender.

02:22:40.144 --> 02:22:41.978
Come along. Off you go.

02:22:44.314 --> 02:22:46.858
Gather in, children.

02:23:11.175 --> 02:23:12.341
Mum?

02:23:29.735 --> 02:23:31.903
Ju-- Julie!

02:24:05.979 --> 02:24:07.438
Jamie?

02:24:13.028 --> 02:24:54.443
Jamie.
