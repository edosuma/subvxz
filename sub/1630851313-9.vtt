WEBVTT

00:05.655 --> 00:07.006
You can do this, Gabi.

00:07.157 --> 00:08.915
Just make a few turns and stops,

00:09.010 --> 00:11.735
park, and don't run over anyone.

00:11.754 --> 00:13.262
Easy as can be.

00:16.333 --> 00:17.516
Morning. My name is Chloe.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.743
I will be your proctor
for the road test portion

00:19.836 --> 00:22.337
of your California driving exam.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.338
Hi.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.191
-I'm Gabi.
-In your own time, Gabi.

00:26.418 --> 00:27.918
Does that mean I should start?

00:27.936 --> 00:30.362
We started when
I got in the car,

00:30.514 --> 00:32.865
but it does mean
your vehicle can move now.

00:33.016 --> 00:34.107
Great.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.161
Let me just secure my seatbelt.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.878
<i> GABI:</i>
<i> Just moved here from Brooklyn.</i>

00:46.105 --> 00:48.789
Take a right up here
at Alvarado.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.049
A right. Got it.

00:50.276 --> 00:51.942
Never had to drive there,
but I guess

00:51.960 --> 00:55.203
everyone here spends half their
lives in their car. (chuckles)

00:55.297 --> 00:57.872
Eyes on the road, please.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.708
What are you writing down?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.044
Is it about how I took my eyes
off the road?

01:03.064 --> 01:06.047
-I won't do that again.
-You were supposed to
take a right.

01:06.141 --> 01:08.216
Oh, crap. I'm sorry.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.717
I've already failed, haven't I?

01:09.737 --> 01:11.144
-The light.
-What?

01:11.297 --> 01:12.554
-The light.
-(gasps)

01:12.648 --> 01:14.389
-(screams)
-(tires screech)

01:14.408 --> 01:16.466
(exhales)

01:16.485 --> 01:18.468
Definitely failed.

01:18.562 --> 01:19.745
Again.

01:21.323 --> 01:23.398
That's why I moved here,
you know?

01:23.417 --> 01:26.476
To the land of mandatory motor
vehicles and terrible bagels

01:26.495 --> 01:28.921
and egg rolls that
are really spring rolls.

01:29.148 --> 01:31.982
Bad breakup.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.759
She said I was weak

01:33.986 --> 01:36.720
and didn't know
how to face my problems.

01:38.173 --> 01:39.506
So I left town.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.159
I'm not unaware that,
in running away,

01:42.252 --> 01:43.510
I kind of proved her point.

01:43.662 --> 01:45.604
Just keep moving.

01:45.755 --> 01:48.181
Right. That's what I'm doing.

01:48.334 --> 01:49.441
Trying to move on.

01:49.593 --> 01:53.112
-Green light.
-(car horn honking)

01:59.102 --> 02:00.677
You did the right thing.

02:00.696 --> 02:02.788
Okay, I swear I knew
what a green light meant

02:03.015 --> 02:04.348
before I started this test.

02:04.366 --> 02:08.368
(chuckles) No.
I mean, moving out here.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.795
Whoever she was,

02:10.022 --> 02:12.965
she's in your rearview now.

02:13.116 --> 02:15.676
Thanks.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.641
-(rumbling)
-That wasn't me.

02:32.561 --> 02:35.237
(siren warbling)

02:42.070 --> 02:43.069
You said "we."

02:43.164 --> 02:44.571
<i>Who else is in the car with you?</i>

02:44.723 --> 02:45.889
The woman from the DMV
is in the passenger seat.

02:45.982 --> 02:47.073
Her name's Chloe. I'm Gabi.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.150
<i> I was taking my driver's test.</i>

02:49.170 --> 02:51.170
-Okay. Are either
of you injured?
-I'm fine,

02:51.397 --> 02:54.822
but Chloe, she has a pen

02:54.917 --> 02:56.583
<i> -stuck in her chest.</i>
-Is it deep?

02:56.735 --> 02:57.843
I don't know.

02:57.994 --> 03:00.295
What's deep when there's
a pen in your chest?

03:00.347 --> 03:03.015
-How does that even happen?
Oh, God.
<i> -Airbags.</i>

03:03.166 --> 03:05.425
Stay with me, Gabi.
As long as that pen stays in,

03:05.577 --> 03:07.911
she should be okay.
Is she conscious?

03:07.930 --> 03:09.746
Yes.

03:09.765 --> 03:13.250
-(wheezing)
-But she's having
trouble breathing.

03:13.268 --> 03:14.918
That can't be good, right?

03:14.937 --> 03:18.346
<i> -The pen might've</i>
<i> punctured her lung.</i>
-Should I...

03:18.440 --> 03:19.606
do something?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.366
Just keep an eye on her
and stay on the line.

03:21.518 --> 03:23.035
Fire and rescue
are arriving now.

03:23.262 --> 03:24.945
(sirens wailing)

03:25.097 --> 03:27.264
<i> BOBBY:</i>
<i>Dispatch, this is Captain Nash.</i>

03:27.282 --> 03:30.358
118. Please advise DWP to shut

03:30.377 --> 03:31.859
<i> the power off on this street.</i>

03:31.879 --> 03:35.047
<i> Have them contact CalGEM</i>
<i> to send a team of engineers</i>

03:35.274 --> 03:36.364
<i> to cap this well.</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:38.199
What is the status
of our victims?

03:38.293 --> 03:39.943
<i> MAY: Gabi, the driver,</i>
<i> appears uninured,</i>

03:39.962 --> 03:41.327
but it sounds like
her passenger, Chloe,

03:41.480 --> 03:42.888
might have
a brachial puncture wound.

03:43.115 --> 03:45.782
-How's her breathing?
-Described as labored.

03:45.801 --> 03:46.874
BOBBY:
<i> Copy that.</i>

03:46.894 --> 03:47.968
Okay, Ravi,

03:48.062 --> 03:50.303
I want you to start
foaming this area.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.046
We don't want
any accidental sparks

03:52.066 --> 03:53.515
igniting this oil.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.808
<i> MAY: How we doing</i>
<i> in there, Gabi?</i>

03:54.902 --> 03:56.551
I think her breathing's worse.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.569
Are they getting us out?

03:57.721 --> 03:59.571
They're working on it.

04:02.968 --> 04:06.620
See if we can get
that hatch open. (grunts)

04:08.916 --> 04:10.807
Help! Get us out!

04:10.826 --> 04:13.493
Ah, it's jammed.
Give me the Jaws. Come on.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.571
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
negative, negative.

04:16.665 --> 04:18.090
Buck, stop. Stop.

04:18.241 --> 04:19.775
We're on top of an oil well.

04:19.777 --> 04:21.151
Isn't that why we have the foam?

04:21.244 --> 04:23.077
No, the foam is just a Band-Aid.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.579
It's good for
a spark or two, but

04:24.598 --> 04:27.432
we start cutting into metal,
this whole thing's gonna go.

04:27.659 --> 04:30.084
Ask the driver
how her breathing sounds.

04:30.178 --> 04:32.086
<i> Any gurgling or choking?</i>

04:32.106 --> 04:34.623
Gabi, can you tell me
how Chloe's breathing sounds?

04:34.625 --> 04:35.607
<i> Any gurgling?</i>

04:35.834 --> 04:36.833
GABI:
I'm not sure.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.259
I can't hear anything in here.

04:38.353 --> 04:39.503
Can you move in closer?

04:39.596 --> 04:42.188
(seatbelt clicks)

04:42.341 --> 04:45.993
(groans) Seat belt.

04:46.936 --> 04:48.845
(strained):
Gonna...

04:48.938 --> 04:50.530
have to...

04:50.682 --> 04:52.791
dock you... (wheezing)

04:53.018 --> 04:56.944
Oh, jokes.
Guess you're feeling better.

04:57.039 --> 04:59.089
Uh-huh.

05:02.044 --> 05:04.452
<i> MAY: Caller says there's</i>
<i> a little gurgling.</i>

05:04.546 --> 05:05.695
Hey.

05:05.864 --> 05:07.622
We shatter the back
of the glass, then go in.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.640
No sparks with glass.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.200
But we got to cut
through the seats

05:10.218 --> 05:11.493
to get to them, and again...

05:11.495 --> 05:12.719
Tools and sparks.

05:12.871 --> 05:14.037
-Yeah.
-What if we, uh,
we shatter the moonroof?

05:14.130 --> 05:15.539
You know, we pull them
up and out.

05:15.632 --> 05:17.390
No, no, no. Look at the flow
of that geyser.

05:17.543 --> 05:20.134
-We bust that glass,
they're gonna drown in oil.
-HEN: Hey! Hey!

05:20.228 --> 05:21.803
One of them has
a sucking chest wound.

05:21.897 --> 05:24.230
If we don't get them out, she's
gonna drown in her own blood.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.384
-We can't wait.
-We need someone
to cap that well.

05:27.477 --> 05:30.996
Well, maybe we cap it ourselves.

05:32.057 --> 05:33.665
Let's go.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.911
(straining):
You didn't...

05:38.005 --> 05:39.412
What?

05:39.565 --> 05:41.465
Run.

05:42.526 --> 05:45.418
Still... here.

05:45.571 --> 05:49.014
Where would I go?
I don't have a license.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.408
(chuckles) Oh!

05:51.501 --> 05:53.927
-(coughing)
-Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!

05:54.021 --> 05:56.337
<i> -No! Chloe!</i>
-Gabi? What's happening?

05:56.464 --> 05:58.415
The pen fell out.
She's bleeding, bad.

05:58.508 --> 06:01.026
Okay. I need you to apply
pressure to the wound.

06:01.177 --> 06:02.252
You have anything
in the car, like

06:02.345 --> 06:05.088
<i> -a clean cloth?</i>
-Um, I...

06:05.181 --> 06:06.180
-Napkins.
<i> -Great.</i>

06:06.274 --> 06:07.924
<i> Just wad them all up</i>
<i> and make a pad.</i>

06:07.943 --> 06:10.443
<i> Then hold it against the wound</i>
<i> and apply direct pressure.</i>

06:10.537 --> 06:12.612
Tight. We just need
to slow down the bleeding.

06:12.764 --> 06:15.615
-For how long?
<i> -Fire and rescue will be able</i>
<i>to get to you in just a minute.</i>

<i> -They just need</i>

06:17.603 --> 06:19.436
Okay-- What? Move it where?

06:19.529 --> 06:22.363
Come on, everybody.
Let's go. Let's push.

06:22.457 --> 06:24.031

to shield your eyes.

06:50.226 --> 06:51.635
Okay. We're ready.

06:51.728 --> 06:54.154
Glass breaking. Three, two, one.

Three-sided dressing, coming up.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.693
Damn it.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.345
The oil wants out.

but there are a bunch
that were just

09:51.983 --> 09:53.091
basically forgotten.

09:53.242 --> 09:54.484
You know, they-they dried up,

09:54.502 --> 09:56.261
they filled them
with trash and covered them.

09:56.412 --> 09:58.321
It's like the-the
ticking time bomb

09:58.340 --> 10:02.225
that could be sitting in your
backyard right now. (laughs)

10:04.271 --> 10:06.087
Uh, Tay?

10:06.181 --> 10:08.665
-Taylor.
-Huh?

10:08.683 --> 10:09.924
Oh, I-I was just, uh,

10:09.943 --> 10:13.278
I was pitching you
a great story. (chuckles)

10:13.429 --> 10:15.355
Uh, I-I did the-the promo tease.

10:15.507 --> 10:18.450
Yeah. I, uh...

10:18.601 --> 10:21.027
Big, um...

10:21.179 --> 10:23.847
oil well... time bombs.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.665
It's great.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.371
Hey, are-are you okay?

10:31.465 --> 10:33.280
Yeah.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.466
I'm just tired.

10:34.693 --> 10:37.377
Haven't really slept well
in the last few days.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.045
I should go home.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.546
(chuckles)

10:40.699 --> 10:43.032
Maybe I'm just sleep-deprived
enough to actually get

10:43.126 --> 10:44.792
-a full night's rest.
-Uh, well-well...

10:44.811 --> 10:47.871
Hold on. Wh-Why don't you, uh,
why don't you stay here?

10:47.889 --> 10:50.223
You don't need to drive all the
way across town just to sleep.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.485
Stay here. I'll-I'll make you
breakfast in the morning,

10:53.712 --> 10:55.487
and, yes, by make I mean

10:55.638 --> 10:58.239
I'll put some frozen waffles
in the toaster.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.618
Sorry. Um...

11:03.071 --> 11:06.122
Waffle rain check?

11:07.075 --> 11:09.542
Yeah. Sure.

11:11.988 --> 11:14.488
-Good night.
-Good night.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.748
(door opens)

11:15.901 --> 11:17.375
<i> BUCK:</i>
<i> I think it's over.</i>

11:17.602 --> 11:19.010
<i> -Uh, me and Taylor.</i>
-(siren wailing)

11:19.237 --> 11:20.178
She went home to get some sleep.

11:20.405 --> 11:22.088
How is that code for it's over?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.907
Well, what's past is prologue,
right?

11:23.925 --> 11:27.427
And, based on my past, Taylor
and I have reached the point

11:27.579 --> 11:30.671
in a relationship
where the woman flees.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.339
Women flee you?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.750
-(chuckles)
-Routinely?

11:33.768 --> 11:36.602
Starts out small.
Uh, she's-she's canceling plans.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.756
She's got to work.
She needs to wash her hair

11:39.849 --> 11:41.682
or do her laundry,

11:41.702 --> 11:43.609
and before you know it, poof.

11:43.762 --> 11:44.944
Dropping them off

11:45.096 --> 11:47.597
at the airport and
never seeing them again.

11:47.615 --> 11:50.266
Okay, Buck, you're being
a little too Buck about this.

11:50.359 --> 11:51.859
EDDIE:
A little? When was the last time

11:51.878 --> 11:55.196
a woman told you she had to
go home to wash her hair? 1952?

11:55.290 --> 11:57.364
-(chuckles)
-HEN: Listen, Taylor is not Abby

11:57.459 --> 11:59.125
or Ally. It doesn't even rhyme.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.626
I mean, that's
a good sign, right?

12:00.779 --> 12:01.961
BUCK:
The thing is...

12:02.055 --> 12:03.446
I-I think she might've been
living with me.

12:03.465 --> 12:06.115
I mean, we never
explicitly said that,

12:06.134 --> 12:08.117
but she's there all the time.

12:08.136 --> 12:11.378
I... It sure feels like
we were living together.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.731
Why does this keep
happening to you?

12:12.882 --> 12:14.048
Well, to be honest, I think...

12:14.067 --> 12:15.641
No. I'm gonna tell you why.

12:15.794 --> 12:17.643
Because you don't talk
to the women you're dating.

12:17.796 --> 12:20.888
You just go with the flow and
find yourself in a relationship

12:20.907 --> 12:22.389
with no idea how you got there

12:22.484 --> 12:24.225
or what to do when things
start to go wrong.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.411
Yeah. Who does that?

12:26.562 --> 12:28.729
My point is, breaking up
is not inevitable.

12:28.823 --> 12:29.914
You can turn it around.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.565
You just have
to make the effort.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.142
Talk to Taylor.
Tell her how you're feeling.

12:33.236 --> 12:35.754
Find ways to reconnect.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.331
Cap knows of what he speaks.

12:38.483 --> 12:40.425
Apparently, May walked in on him

12:40.652 --> 12:43.503
and Athena reconnecting
in the kitchen the other night.

12:43.655 --> 12:45.338
(chuckles)

12:45.490 --> 12:48.600
Oh, God. Parental nightmare.

12:48.751 --> 12:50.660
Well, apparently,
my wife has been oversharing.

12:50.678 --> 12:52.178
I mean, I just wasn't aware

12:52.330 --> 12:54.105
that we were able
to bring our gear home

12:54.257 --> 12:55.498
for recreational purposes.

12:55.591 --> 12:57.091
-Aw...
-(laughs)

12:57.110 --> 12:58.668
You've been playing
sexy firefighter, Cap?

12:58.761 --> 13:02.021
What makes you think
that I was the firefighter?

13:02.173 --> 13:03.264
BUCK:
Oh, come on.

13:03.358 --> 13:04.524
I don't want to think
about that,

13:04.618 --> 13:06.009
and... now I can't stop.

13:06.027 --> 13:07.434
(laughs)

13:07.529 --> 13:09.178
(siren wailing)

13:09.197 --> 13:10.789
Tejada.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.199
-You called it in?
-Yeah. I was driving by,
and I saw the hood up,

13:13.293 --> 13:14.517
and that's when I saw him.

13:14.536 --> 13:16.369
He was breathing,
but he didn't respond

13:16.521 --> 13:18.296
-when I tried to talk to him.
-Trying to charge his engine.

13:18.447 --> 13:20.523
Looks like he gave
himself a shock.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.692
He must've fallen
and hit his head.

13:22.710 --> 13:25.452
Sir, can you hear me?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.971
(echoing):
Sir, can you hear me?

13:27.123 --> 13:28.306
I'm with the LAFD.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.958
You took
a pretty nasty fall, so...

13:30.977 --> 13:33.561
we're gonna just
check you out, okay?

13:37.133 --> 13:38.057
CLIVE:
Antonia?

13:38.209 --> 13:40.059
Pupils are equal and reactive.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.727
BP is stable.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.304
Sir, what's your name?

13:43.398 --> 13:44.305
Clive Wexler.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.490
Do you know where you are?

13:45.641 --> 13:46.883
CLIVE:
Flat on my back

13:46.901 --> 13:48.309
in the driveway
in front of my house,

13:48.403 --> 13:49.661
unfortunately.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.891
Wilson. Antonia Wilson?

13:54.984 --> 13:56.000
What year is it?

13:56.227 --> 13:58.411
-That's usually our question.
-HEN: Well...

13:58.563 --> 14:01.488
Antonia Wilson is my mother,
but...

14:01.508 --> 14:03.508
though I don't think
I've ever heard anyone

14:03.735 --> 14:04.992
call her by that name.

14:05.086 --> 14:06.736
Antonia's daughter?

14:06.754 --> 14:09.663
-You two know each other?
-Knew.

14:09.757 --> 14:10.923
She and I were friends.

14:11.076 --> 14:12.833
Good friends,
when we were younger,

14:12.927 --> 14:14.686
but I haven't seen her since...

14:14.837 --> 14:16.337
got to be over 40 years ago now.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.264
Doesn't seem to be fractured.

14:18.416 --> 14:22.193
Let's cover the wound and
transport him to the hospital.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.012
So you and my mom were close?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.680
I certainly thought so,

14:26.700 --> 14:28.199
but if I know Toni,

14:28.426 --> 14:30.760
she wouldn't want me discussing
her personal business,

14:30.778 --> 14:32.762
-even with her own daughter.
-(chuckling)

14:32.855 --> 14:35.356
Especially with
her own daughter.

14:35.450 --> 14:38.951
Antonia was always
a snappy dresser.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.770
Her coat of armor
was her favorite piece,

14:40.863 --> 14:43.030
if you know what I mean.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.382
I understood, though.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.293
You catch enough shrapnel
and, eventually,

14:47.445 --> 14:49.445
you don't want to leave
any part of yourself exposed.

14:49.464 --> 14:51.948
So, if you knew
my mom back then,

14:51.966 --> 14:54.208
then you probably
knew my dad, too.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.644
He was the shrapnel.

15:53.361 --> 15:56.012
Hi. I'm Doris Claypool,

15:56.030 --> 15:57.271
the casino manager.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.864
They really shouldn't
have called you.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.199
It's not a big deal.

16:00.351 --> 16:02.493
Caller said something
about $1 million missing.

16:02.645 --> 16:05.797
Well, yeah, but you guys
are about 30 years too late.

16:06.024 --> 16:07.356
(chuckles)

16:07.375 --> 16:10.117
The robbery happened in 1987?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.044
Guy held up one
of our blackjack tables,

16:12.197 --> 16:13.787
made off with
a million two in chips,

16:13.807 --> 16:16.382
sped away on a motorcycle,
and was never heard from again.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.883
And I'm here why?

16:18.052 --> 16:20.886
Someone tried to cash one of
the stolen chips this morning.

16:21.039 --> 16:21.962
Who?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.206
Pretty sure this face

16:23.224 --> 16:24.874
wasn't even born in '87.

16:24.892 --> 16:26.317
-'94.
-Neil...

16:26.469 --> 16:28.135
-"Bee-sco..."
-Biscobing.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.563
Rhymes with "disco king."

16:30.715 --> 16:32.064
Sorry. Old family joke.

16:32.217 --> 16:34.475
If you say so.

16:34.569 --> 16:36.477
Explain the chip, Neil.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.645
Well, I'm a bell-ringer
for Santa's Helping Hand,

16:38.665 --> 16:40.814
and someone must've
put it in my bucket.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.074
Didn't see who.

16:42.227 --> 16:43.075
Didn't even notice the chip

16:43.169 --> 16:44.168
until I was on my lunch break.

16:44.395 --> 16:45.670
ATHENA:
And then you decided

16:45.897 --> 16:46.912
to try and cash it.

16:47.065 --> 16:49.656
It'd feed thousands of families.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.418
You said that no one ever saw

16:52.512 --> 16:53.736
the robber's face.

16:53.829 --> 16:55.238
Any chance you saw
the rest of him

16:55.256 --> 16:56.739
on one of your cameras inside?

16:56.758 --> 17:00.092
Maybe it will jingle
Kris Kringle's memory.

17:00.245 --> 17:01.410
We wouldn't have
that footage anymore.

17:01.429 --> 17:02.912
Everything would've been
turned over

17:02.930 --> 17:03.929
to the police in '87.

17:04.082 --> 17:05.581
And I'm sure your people

17:05.600 --> 17:07.600
have already tossed it
in the trash by now.

17:07.752 --> 17:10.920
You'd be surprised
how inefficient we are.

17:11.013 --> 17:13.422
Neil, write down your number.

17:13.516 --> 17:16.534
If I find the robber,
you might remember him.

17:20.114 --> 17:22.999
("Great Divide" by Yola playing)

17:24.786 --> 17:26.419

17:28.273 --> 17:29.863
I'm surprised
you don't remember him,

17:29.883 --> 17:32.108
'cause he sure remembered you.

17:32.126 --> 17:33.217
I remember Clive.

17:33.444 --> 17:35.053
It was just a long time ago.

17:35.204 --> 17:36.888
Where'd you even meet him?

17:37.115 --> 17:38.464
On a case.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.040
Yeah, a police officer found him
unconscious in his driveway.

17:40.134 --> 17:41.893
Is he all right?

17:42.044 --> 17:44.303
Mm-hmm. He's fine.

17:44.455 --> 17:46.472
He was just fixing
an old convertible

17:46.624 --> 17:48.808
and shocked himself,
so he ended up

17:48.960 --> 17:50.735
with a bump on the head.

17:50.886 --> 17:53.696
He still has that car?

17:55.466 --> 17:58.301
He said you two went way back.

17:58.319 --> 17:59.577
He wasn't that
forthcoming, though,

17:59.728 --> 18:01.654
with the details
on how you knew each other.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.748
You know, from the neighborhood.

18:03.899 --> 18:05.566
-(door closes)
-ATHENA: I'm home.

18:05.660 --> 18:08.753
-Sorry I'm late.
-Oh, let me help you with that.

18:08.904 --> 18:11.163
Ah, thank you. Kids not in?

18:11.316 --> 18:14.650
Karen took Harry and Denny
to get some ice cream.

18:14.669 --> 18:16.928
-Oh. What about May?
-Uh, said she couldn't make it.

18:17.155 --> 18:19.097
Scarred for life. (laughs)

18:19.324 --> 18:20.765
What's up with the box?

18:20.916 --> 18:22.266
Uh, evidence
from an old cold case.

18:22.418 --> 18:23.843
Actually, it's why
I called you here.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.436
I need a consultant.

18:25.663 --> 18:26.753
Me?

18:26.848 --> 18:29.014
Someone robbed
The Fairwell Casino.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.942
-When? I didn't hear about that.
-1987.

18:31.093 --> 18:32.276
TONI:
And they got away?

18:32.428 --> 18:34.520
They usually don't make it
out the front door.

18:34.672 --> 18:37.173
Usually don't make it out
with all their teeth, either.

18:37.266 --> 18:38.858
(laughs) Let me
get you some wine.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.100
Thank you, baby.

18:40.194 --> 18:41.510
-Thanks.
-So how much are we talking?

18:41.529 --> 18:43.012
A million in chips.

18:43.030 --> 18:44.956
Guy in a motorcycle helmet

18:45.183 --> 18:47.941
came in, drew a gun
on the dealer,

18:47.961 --> 18:49.185
then cleared them out.

18:49.278 --> 18:51.854
How many tables did he hit?

18:51.873 --> 18:53.297
Well, as far as I know,
just the one.

18:53.449 --> 18:55.782
That's a lot of money
for one table.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.526
When I was a dealer,

18:57.620 --> 18:59.528
we used a 12 barrel tray

18:59.622 --> 19:01.697
with 60 chips per barrel.

19:01.790 --> 19:05.309
Depending on the time of day,
I might have anywhere from...

19:05.461 --> 19:08.387
a hundred grand
to half a mil at my table.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.631
Hmm. It was 8:00 a.m.
on a Wednesday.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.134
Must've been a special request
from a high roller.

19:14.228 --> 19:15.636
It's not uncommon, but,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.989
usually, somebody
has to sign off on a request.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.549
Hmm, y'all do that a lot
at casinos?

19:20.568 --> 19:22.551
If we know them? Sure.

19:22.570 --> 19:24.645
A fool and his money
are soon parted.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.238
-(chuckles)
-And it's our job

19:26.332 --> 19:29.892
to make that parting
as easy as possible.

19:29.985 --> 19:30.835
Savage.

19:31.062 --> 19:31.985
A million dollars.

19:32.005 --> 19:32.986
Don't get too excited.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.172
Even if I find it,

19:34.323 --> 19:35.530
-we can't keep it.
-Yeah.

19:35.532 --> 19:38.234
It's an interesting
mystery, though.

19:38.252 --> 19:41.828
A masked man gets away
with a million dollars.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.907
Never seen or heard from

19:45.000 --> 19:46.684
ever again.

19:46.911 --> 19:48.911
And the chips
never turned up, either?

19:49.004 --> 19:50.413
Not until today.

19:50.431 --> 19:53.191
Wait a minute. D.B. Cooper
only made away with 200,000,

19:53.418 --> 19:54.917
and how many books
and documentaries

19:55.010 --> 19:56.343
have there been about him?

19:56.362 --> 19:58.512
And yet we've never heard
of this biker bandit?

19:58.531 --> 20:01.106
Ooh, I like that. Catchy.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.926
Casinos pride themselves
on their security.

20:03.945 --> 20:07.538
Can't have people thinking it's
like knocking over a 7-Eleven.

20:07.690 --> 20:11.042
Damn, Ma. You really know
everything about casinos.

20:11.193 --> 20:13.285
I worked there.

20:13.438 --> 20:16.047
And maybe our thief did, too.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.873
Uh, hey.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.727
-You're here.
-Hi.

20:29.954 --> 20:31.971
I, uh, thought you said, like,
an hour ago

20:32.123 --> 20:33.622
you couldn't come over tonight.

20:33.716 --> 20:35.900
Uh, I was looking for my tablet.
I think I left it here.

20:36.051 --> 20:38.236
Uh, yeah.

20:38.463 --> 20:40.238
Uh...

20:44.469 --> 20:47.995
Ah. Thank you.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.308
Uh, why don't you
stay for dinner?

20:52.401 --> 20:56.495
Uh, can't. Got an early
flight in the morning.

20:56.647 --> 20:57.830
Hey, wh-what's going on?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.573
First you're in here
sneaking around

20:59.667 --> 21:02.001
trying to grab your stuff,
and now you're...

21:02.153 --> 21:03.168
you're skipping town?

21:03.321 --> 21:04.595
I'm not skipping town, Buck.

21:04.822 --> 21:06.505
Taylor, if you're gonna
break up with me, then just...

21:06.657 --> 21:08.933
Who said anything
about breaking up?

21:09.084 --> 21:10.326
It's just for a day or two.

21:10.419 --> 21:11.677
We can talk about it
when I get back.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.845
No!

21:12.939 --> 21:15.347
No, I'm sorry,
but we-we can't.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.774
We're gonna talk about it now,

21:17.001 --> 21:18.776
'cause if you're gonna be
weird and distant,

21:18.927 --> 21:19.944
and then just take off,

21:20.171 --> 21:21.696
you cannot expect me
not to worry.

21:23.265 --> 21:25.241
At least tell me
where you're going.

21:26.268 --> 21:28.494
My father's parole hearing.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.038
<i> TAYLOR:</i>
<i> I was the one who found her.</i>

21:39.132 --> 21:42.207
The coroner ruled it a suicide.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.950
Then, eight months later,
they came back

21:43.970 --> 21:46.862
and arrested my father.

21:46.955 --> 21:48.864
So your dad killed your mom.

21:48.883 --> 21:52.701
Well, that's what
the second jury said.

21:52.795 --> 21:56.872
The first one was a little more
split on their feelings.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.557
And what about your feelings?

21:58.651 --> 22:02.236
A much more complicated story.

22:04.549 --> 22:05.639
He's my dad.

22:05.733 --> 22:08.159
There's a part of me that
could never believe

22:08.310 --> 22:10.811
he could have done this.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.222
But it's not like I can
imagine my mother

22:13.240 --> 22:15.407
doing that to herself.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.894
So you just spent
all these years not knowing?

22:18.987 --> 22:21.005
Everybody had a theory.

22:21.156 --> 22:25.176
My mom's family,
my dad's family.

22:25.327 --> 22:29.254
Living in between the two
was pretty... messy.

22:29.407 --> 22:32.408
And now I have to go
in front of a parole board

22:32.426 --> 22:35.019
and convince them that
he's a good person

22:35.246 --> 22:36.187
who deserves a second chance.

22:36.414 --> 22:38.247
Whoa, hey, there's gotta be
a way for us

22:38.265 --> 22:39.915
to find out
what really happened.

22:39.934 --> 22:41.266
You know, maybe we could, uh,

22:41.419 --> 22:43.769
we could take another look
at the case.

22:43.921 --> 22:45.196
You think I haven't?

22:45.423 --> 22:49.015
I have talked to family,
friends, investigators.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.184
It all came back
to the same place.

22:51.278 --> 22:55.039
Only two people know
what really happened.

22:55.190 --> 22:57.041
And one of them is dead.

22:57.268 --> 22:59.585
-And the other one?
-Swears he's innocent.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.274
Wait, well,

23:05.367 --> 23:07.109
let me come with you
at least.

23:07.202 --> 23:09.278
You know, I can get
a plane ticket, and...

23:09.296 --> 23:11.447
No.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.057
I don't want that.

23:13.284 --> 23:17.711
This isn't your childhood
trauma, Buck, it's mine.

23:17.805 --> 23:20.523
I need to deal with this
on my own.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.298
(sighs)
Bobby.

23:29.391 --> 23:30.574
-What are you doing up?
-You gotta check this out.

23:30.801 --> 23:33.411
No, no, no, no, I'm not
checking anything out.

23:33.562 --> 23:35.638
Come to bed. Those tapes will
be there in the morning.

23:35.656 --> 23:39.733
-It'll only take a second.
Come on.
-No, no. (sighs)

23:39.827 --> 23:41.735
(sighs deeply)

23:41.829 --> 23:45.648
-Okay, here he is right after
he hit the table.
-Mm-hmm.

23:45.741 --> 23:47.425
Now, security scrambles
as soon as they know

23:47.576 --> 23:49.334
-that there's a robbery
happening, right?
-Mm-hmm.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.911
Here they are,
right on his heels.

23:50.930 --> 23:55.641
-As they should be.
-But now, watch this.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.086
-Oh...
-Here he is, seconds after.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.014
-ATHENA:
Where are the guards?
-Exactly.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.515
Run that back.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.184
(rewinding)

24:05.278 --> 24:07.111
How'd he get such a huge lead?

24:07.262 --> 24:09.521
That is the $1.2 million
question.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.449
You still think
it was an inside job?

24:11.600 --> 24:12.950
Well, Toni said someone
would have to approve

24:13.177 --> 24:14.359
the extra chips on the table,

24:14.454 --> 24:17.455
-so security probably knew.
-Look at them stop there.

24:17.682 --> 24:20.791
-I mean, maybe they did
do it on purpose.
-Inside job.

24:20.943 --> 24:24.536
Eliminate the impossible, and
only the improbable remains.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.112
Oh, yeah. O-Okay, Sherlock.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.316
-(laughs)
-All right, run that back.

24:29.376 --> 24:31.210
(video player malfunctioning)

24:31.304 --> 24:35.139
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

24:36.701 --> 24:39.143
Mm, I don't suppose there's
any way you could fix that.

24:39.294 --> 24:40.961
Well, I mean, I could try
to piece it together, but...

24:41.055 --> 24:44.315
Mm-mm. (sighs)

24:44.542 --> 24:49.653
Or, there is another way
we could test our theory.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.805
What other way?

24:51.824 --> 24:54.200
Rob the casino.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.979
<i> EDDIE:</i>
<i> "From the neighborhood"?</i>

24:58.998 --> 25:00.498
Yep. That's all she said.

25:00.649 --> 25:02.333
Like he was some guy
she used to see

25:02.484 --> 25:03.575
on the corner or something.

25:03.728 --> 25:05.894
She used to definitely see him,
all right.

25:05.988 --> 25:07.171
Right?

25:07.322 --> 25:08.506
I wasn't just imagining that.

25:08.657 --> 25:10.566
Clive and Toni were definitely
a thing.

25:10.584 --> 25:13.585
And I mean, like, big time,
long-lost-love kind of thing.

25:13.679 --> 25:17.014
My abuela would eat this up.
She loves a good telenovela.

25:17.241 --> 25:19.575
Oh, 'cause, uh,
'cause you don't?

25:19.593 --> 25:21.076
Come on, I know you
watch 'em with Christopher.

25:21.095 --> 25:22.669
That's how we practice
our Spanish.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.079
-Uh-huh.
-Real question is,

25:24.098 --> 25:27.191
what happens next
in the story?

25:27.342 --> 25:29.693
Well, I-I do have his number.

25:29.845 --> 25:31.845
I could call him.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.589
I mean, just to see
how he's doing after his fall.

25:33.607 --> 25:36.182
-Of course.
-Whoa, hold on, you don't know

25:36.202 --> 25:37.517
why they broke up, right?

25:37.611 --> 25:39.370
I mean, I mean, what if
there's some deep trauma

25:39.521 --> 25:40.687
that shouldn't be poked at?

25:40.706 --> 25:43.932
Since when did you become
the voice of reason?

25:43.951 --> 25:45.951
-Did something happen
with Taylor?
-Uh, no, you just--

25:46.045 --> 25:50.256
You guys were right,
she's not breaking up with me.

25:52.626 --> 25:55.368
That's all you're giving us?
We still got... Oh.

25:55.388 --> 25:58.463
-Okay.
-Three minutes?!
-Whoo!

25:58.616 --> 26:01.392
How the hell did you manage
to shave almost three minutes

26:01.543 --> 26:04.286
off of Buck's best
coffee run time?

26:04.379 --> 26:06.121
It's called a mobile order, Hen.
Walked in

26:06.214 --> 26:07.139
and the drinks were waiting.

26:07.291 --> 26:10.025
This just better be oat milk.

26:11.595 --> 26:13.946
Damn it, he even got
the order right.

26:14.799 --> 26:16.815
<i> BOBBY:</i>
<i> Club sodas,</i>

26:16.909 --> 26:18.892
shaken, not stirred.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.636
For you I get, but for me?

26:20.729 --> 26:22.321
-We're working here.
-Are we?

26:22.415 --> 26:24.397
'Cause it feels a little more
like we're playing.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.141
Not to say that I mind.

26:26.234 --> 26:28.310
I'm gonna need a little vodka

26:28.403 --> 26:30.570
-in this club soda.
-Yes, miss.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.256
So the high rollers
were over here.

26:32.483 --> 26:33.982
There was over a million
dollars' worth of chips

26:34.076 --> 26:35.241
right over there.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.835
And from what I remember
about the tape,

26:36.987 --> 26:38.170
security was way over there.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.322
-Hmm.
-All right,

26:40.415 --> 26:41.932
let me have your purse.

26:42.159 --> 26:44.676
Oh. It doesn't really go
with that outfit.

26:44.770 --> 26:45.844
You don't think?

26:46.013 --> 26:48.439
Okay, I'm the biker bandit,
you're security.

26:48.590 --> 26:52.092
You take your position,
and as soon as I grab this,

26:52.111 --> 26:53.277
you come after me,
and I'll try and escape.

26:53.428 --> 26:54.778
We are taking this role-playing

26:54.930 --> 26:56.447
a little more public
than necessary.

26:56.598 --> 26:58.023
We retrace his steps,
we'll figure out

26:58.175 --> 26:59.191
how the bandit got away.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.433
-If you say so.
-Just remember,

27:00.453 --> 27:01.860
it's not so much
about the speed

27:02.012 --> 27:03.120
as it is about the distance.

27:03.271 --> 27:04.363
So if you match my pace,
it should work out.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.625

27:45.389 --> 27:47.389
Valet and the motorcycle
is over there.

And somehow he was able
to leapfrog them

I just don't see how
he could make it

27:55.065 --> 27:56.322
from there to there.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.400
Bobby, there's
an entire racetrack

27:58.419 --> 27:59.510
and grandstand out there.

27:59.661 --> 28:01.327
Now, he could have jumped
over the seats

28:01.347 --> 28:03.847
-and doubled back out there.
-Miss? Here you go.

28:03.999 --> 28:05.557
ATHENA:
Thank you.

28:06.577 --> 28:08.352
BOBBY:
The fire extinguishers.

28:08.503 --> 28:10.837
I can't believe I didn't
catch this before. Look.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.506
Per code, they have to be
three feet off the ground.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.934
Now, on his way in,
our biker bandit looks to be

28:16.086 --> 28:17.677
-about six feet tall.
-Mm-hmm.

28:17.771 --> 28:20.105
But when he leaves...

28:20.257 --> 28:22.348
ATHENA:
The robber is shorter
going out than when he came in?

28:22.443 --> 28:24.760
He didn't double back,
he had a double.

28:24.778 --> 28:28.430
-What do you think, like,
five seven, five eight?
-Yeah.

28:28.449 --> 28:29.689
Sergeant Grant.

28:29.783 --> 28:32.267
Didn't think you were
working this case anymore.

28:32.286 --> 28:34.861
This is my husband,
Bobby Nash.

28:34.955 --> 28:36.380
-Just wanted to show him
the place.
-Mm.

28:36.531 --> 28:38.882
Yeah, she was telling me
all about your biker bandit.

28:39.109 --> 28:40.609
-My what?
-The thief.

28:40.627 --> 28:42.886
Just a little name
I came up with for him.

28:43.113 --> 28:44.629
Did you work here then?

28:44.782 --> 28:46.798
-I did. I was a dealer.
-Oh.

28:46.951 --> 28:49.042
But not that morning.
I was in class.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.119
Business school.
Student by day,

28:51.213 --> 28:52.396
blackjack dealer by night.
(chuckles)

28:52.547 --> 28:54.623
And now you're running
the place.

28:54.641 --> 28:56.900
Well, I didn't want to stand
at a table forever.

28:57.127 --> 28:58.460
Well, listen, while you're here,

28:58.479 --> 29:00.295
you should check out
the restaurant.

29:00.388 --> 29:01.739
We'd be happy to comp you both
a nice meal,

29:01.966 --> 29:03.131
a nice bottle of wine...

29:03.225 --> 29:05.909
-Oh, well...
-That's kind. Very kind.

29:06.136 --> 29:07.135
But we couldn't accept.

29:07.229 --> 29:08.971
Well, if you change your mind,

29:09.064 --> 29:11.990
you know where to find me.

29:12.142 --> 29:13.733
(weak chuckle)

29:13.827 --> 29:16.402
-Well, that was interesting.
-Hmm.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.815
You thinking what I'm thinking?

29:19.833 --> 29:22.075
Five seven.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.386
Maybe five eight.

29:32.104 --> 29:36.181
Biscobing.
Rhymes with "disco king."

29:36.275 --> 29:38.442
-You remembered.
-Not a common name.

29:38.593 --> 29:40.519
I ran across it again
this morning.

29:40.671 --> 29:43.338
There was a Jimmy Biscobing
that was a regular

29:43.431 --> 29:46.933
at the Fairwell back in '87.

29:47.027 --> 29:48.193
That was my uncle.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.178
He passed away weeks ago
from stomach cancer.

29:50.197 --> 29:52.289
Sorry for your loss.

29:52.516 --> 29:54.440
He gave you the chip
before he died?

29:54.460 --> 29:57.035
I found it as my dad and I
were cleaning out his place.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.505
That's not all I found.

30:04.211 --> 30:06.878
-Jimmy.
-You two were a thing?

30:07.031 --> 30:08.138
No one knew.

30:08.365 --> 30:12.367
The bosses frowned on
employees dating players.

30:12.386 --> 30:14.553
Probably afraid you'd give them
inside information?

30:14.647 --> 30:18.464
Like how to rob a casino,
for instance?

30:18.484 --> 30:21.301
There needed to be two of you.

30:21.395 --> 30:23.712
<i> One for the guards</i>
<i> to chase out front,</i>

30:23.730 --> 30:26.532
<i>and another to slip out the back</i>
<i> with the money.</i>

30:27.993 --> 30:30.310
It wasn't like we were stealing;

30:30.404 --> 30:32.721
the casino got the chips back.

30:32.739 --> 30:34.331
Cashing out.

30:34.482 --> 30:35.907
<i> DORIS:</i>
<i>We tossed the high-value chips.</i>
<i> We knew those were</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:36.834
<i> too easy to trace.</i>

30:37.061 --> 30:39.061
Sorry, forgot one.

30:39.154 --> 30:40.320
<i> We split the rest.</i>

30:40.414 --> 30:42.005
<i> I used my share</i>
<i> to finish school,</i>

30:42.157 --> 30:45.083
<i> get my MBA,</i>
<i> move up in the company.</i>

30:45.235 --> 30:47.219
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> And Jimmy's share?</i>

30:48.739 --> 30:50.238
Player busts.

30:50.257 --> 30:53.075
<i> They got that back, too.</i>

30:53.093 --> 30:54.334
Am I under arrest?

30:54.428 --> 30:56.002
There isn't anything
we can do legally

30:56.021 --> 30:57.688
about it at this point.

30:57.839 --> 30:59.081
Believe me, I looked.

30:59.099 --> 31:01.600
But I did speak
with your employers.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.026
(exhales sharply)

31:03.253 --> 31:04.361
Did they really have to know?

31:04.512 --> 31:07.105
I could have retired early,
kept it quiet.

31:07.257 --> 31:09.491
And I don't really do quiet.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.621
(indistinct radio transmission)

31:29.221 --> 31:31.388
♪ ♪

31:39.732 --> 31:41.047
Buck?

31:41.066 --> 31:44.234
(sighs)
I told you not to come.

31:44.386 --> 31:47.145
Uh, you know me.
(chuckles)

31:47.297 --> 31:49.055
I don't always listen.

31:49.149 --> 31:51.224
Are you okay?

31:51.243 --> 31:53.243
No.

31:54.896 --> 31:57.806
I couldn't do it.

31:57.899 --> 31:59.750
Stand up and say he deserves

31:59.977 --> 32:04.980
a second chance when...

32:04.998 --> 32:07.149
I'm not sure he does.

32:07.167 --> 32:11.911
Uh, well, that-that must have
been really hard.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.673
Like, kind of brave, though.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.416
You know? Uh...

32:16.435 --> 32:18.918
To admit how you,
how you really feel.

32:19.012 --> 32:22.314
He told me I was
a terrible daughter.

32:25.185 --> 32:27.736
After everything
he'd done for me and...

32:30.507 --> 32:32.357
...how he'd always been there
for me,

32:32.509 --> 32:34.693
-and I was letting him down.
-No. Hey, hey, hey, you're not.

32:34.845 --> 32:36.511
You're not, okay?

32:36.530 --> 32:39.122
You were doing
what was right for you.

32:39.274 --> 32:40.958
And if he can't
understand that...

32:41.109 --> 32:43.961
Maybe you should have
talked to him.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.633
Guess we both came
all this way for nothing.

32:50.952 --> 32:52.527
There are no answers here.

32:52.546 --> 32:54.787
That's not why I came.

32:54.881 --> 32:57.532
I'm only here for you.

32:57.551 --> 33:00.727
In case you needed me.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.069
Haven't been here
in forever.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.313
Hasn't really changed
much at all.

33:20.407 --> 33:23.074
Did you used to, uh,
come here a lot?

33:23.168 --> 33:24.909
I don't remember that.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.462
Way before your time.

33:33.995 --> 33:36.179
So, what's going on?

33:36.331 --> 33:40.075
I know you didn't
bring me out for pizza alone

33:40.093 --> 33:41.667
just because.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.080
What's this terrible news
you're about to spring on me?

33:45.098 --> 33:48.316
It's not terrible, it's just...

33:50.512 --> 33:52.678
Hello, Antonia.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.282
Clive.

33:59.096 --> 34:01.020
These are for you.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.748
It's good to see you again,
Antonia.

34:04.434 --> 34:06.859
Thank you.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.361
You look well.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.214
Not as good as I looked
30 years ago, but,

34:11.366 --> 34:13.508
then again, time does that
to a man.

34:17.114 --> 34:18.722
Well, would you like
to join us, Clive?

34:18.949 --> 34:21.058
I can find us a...

34:21.209 --> 34:24.561
Enough, Henrietta.
I'm not staying.

34:26.214 --> 34:30.984
I'm sorry, Clive, but...
you came here for nothing.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.130
-Antonia...
-I'm-I'm so sorry.

34:35.223 --> 34:36.740
Let me go talk to her.

34:36.967 --> 34:40.652
Mom! Ma, are you okay?

34:40.804 --> 34:43.080
-I-I, I didn't mean to...
-Yes, you did!

34:43.231 --> 34:44.748
It's who you are.

34:44.899 --> 34:47.250
-You can never leave
well enough alone.
-No, I just...

34:47.402 --> 34:51.313
The past is the past
for a reason, Henrietta.

34:51.331 --> 34:55.217
It's best to just
leave it there.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.317
Ah...

35:14.004 --> 35:16.488
(sighs)

35:17.783 --> 35:20.266
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.677
-About my parents.
-(chuckles)

35:22.696 --> 35:24.287
Well, that's okay.

35:24.439 --> 35:28.792
I, too, understand
a complicated family dynamic

35:28.943 --> 35:32.687
that's hard to put into words.

35:32.706 --> 35:34.131
After he went to prison,

35:34.282 --> 35:36.466
I went to live with my aunt.

35:36.693 --> 35:42.121
I'd meet new people, and
there was always this moment.

35:42.215 --> 35:45.867
This look that would
come across their face

35:45.960 --> 35:48.386
when they realized who I was.

35:48.480 --> 35:53.208
It was like, you know, I could
see what they were thinking.

35:53.226 --> 35:57.529
"Oh... you're that girl."

35:59.641 --> 36:03.809
So when you got old enough,
you moved to a place

36:03.829 --> 36:07.455
where no one knew that girl.

36:11.653 --> 36:14.896
I tell other people's stories
for a living

36:14.989 --> 36:19.426
because I hate telling
my own.

36:23.907 --> 36:25.682
Hey...

36:28.854 --> 36:31.563
(exhales sharply)
I'm sorry.

36:33.007 --> 36:35.692
Me, too.

36:44.018 --> 36:45.660
You okay, Ma?

36:48.765 --> 36:50.207
I'm fine.

36:50.434 --> 36:55.027
Are you still upset with me
for, uh...

36:55.047 --> 36:57.047
for meddling?

36:57.198 --> 37:01.609
Just feeling a little
melancholy.

37:01.628 --> 37:02.944
(chuckles)

37:03.037 --> 37:05.722
That's pictures of you and me.

37:05.873 --> 37:07.873
And Dad, not so much.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.801
I'd like to say
that was because

37:09.953 --> 37:12.287
he was the one
with the camera.

37:12.305 --> 37:16.140
But you and I both know
that's not true.

37:16.293 --> 37:19.694
He was never there,
even when he was.

37:20.964 --> 37:24.557
It was an affair, Henrietta.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.317
Me and Clive.

37:26.470 --> 37:31.081
While I was married
to your father.

37:31.308 --> 37:32.640
You're not surprised.

37:32.659 --> 37:34.976
You storming off
when the man was trying

37:34.995 --> 37:37.328
to give you flowers

37:37.481 --> 37:38.255
was a clue.

37:38.406 --> 37:43.093
Last time I saw Clive
was 1978.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.653
He asked me to run away
with him.

37:45.747 --> 37:46.930
You were gonna leave Dad?

37:47.157 --> 37:50.341
I knew it was wrong, but...

37:50.435 --> 37:54.846
when Clive talked about
the future we could have

37:54.940 --> 37:58.758
together...

37:58.852 --> 38:01.352
I saw it...

38:01.505 --> 38:06.157
and I wanted it
with my whole heart.

38:07.286 --> 38:10.787
But the day I was supposed
to meet him,

38:10.938 --> 38:13.105
I...

38:13.125 --> 38:16.184
Stood him up.

38:16.277 --> 38:18.703
-I had my reasons.
-W-Why?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.505
Why would you...

38:22.801 --> 38:27.470
Wait. 1978.

38:27.622 --> 38:30.198
Oh, Ma.

38:30.291 --> 38:31.549
Me?

38:31.718 --> 38:35.203
The doctor called the morning
we were supposed to go.

38:35.296 --> 38:39.057
I was willing
to leave my husband,

38:39.209 --> 38:42.968
but I couldn't walk out
on the father of my child.

38:43.063 --> 38:45.213
I mean, are you--
Are you even sure that Dad

38:45.231 --> 38:47.807
-was-was-was...
-Henrietta.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.643
This ain't<i> Maury Povich.</i>

38:50.662 --> 38:54.164
Yes. I'm sure.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.655
What's this?

39:02.674 --> 39:04.490
Clive's number.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.660
I wasn't sure if I should
risk your wrath again

39:07.679 --> 39:09.904
giving it to you, but...

39:09.997 --> 39:12.407
-now...
-Honey,

39:12.425 --> 39:15.927
I think Clive and I are
well past our expiration date.

39:16.079 --> 39:17.412
You don't know that.

39:17.430 --> 39:20.690
Maybe the future
that you glimpsed back then,

39:20.917 --> 39:23.175
maybe it's now, Ma.

39:23.195 --> 39:27.572
And all you need to do
is step into it.

39:30.610 --> 39:32.685
You're not...

39:32.704 --> 39:35.121
ashamed of me?

39:37.267 --> 39:38.433
No.

39:38.451 --> 39:42.212
I know that things were
never good with Dad,

39:42.439 --> 39:45.698
and that you were alone
and unhappy

39:45.717 --> 39:47.592
for a long time, Ma.

39:49.629 --> 39:51.537
So I'm not ashamed.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.723
I'm just glad

39:53.875 --> 39:57.619
that somebody loved you

39:57.712 --> 39:59.270
before I did.

40:03.793 --> 40:06.444
Thank you.

40:12.152 --> 40:14.077
-Hey.
-BOBBY: We're over here.

40:14.228 --> 40:16.137
What are you doing?

40:16.230 --> 40:18.748
Gin. And I'm winning.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.733
Come on.
Two out of three.

40:20.827 --> 40:22.477
You just don't know
when to quit, do you? (laughs)

40:22.495 --> 40:24.812
-Well, it's good to see
you two...
-What?

40:24.906 --> 40:26.648
Doing old married couple stuff,
like playing cards?

40:26.666 --> 40:28.925
-Mm. And solving crime. Mm-hmm.
-We're pretty good at that.

40:29.152 --> 40:30.260
Oh, uh, this is yours.

40:30.411 --> 40:33.245
It got mixed up with my mail
the other day.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.931
